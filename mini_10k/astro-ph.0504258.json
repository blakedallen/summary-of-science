Its study includes several physical parameters, of which the magnetic\nfield is the least observed. Magnetic field observations are divided into measurements of\nthe Zeeman effect (in order to obtain the magnetic field strength in the line of sight), and\nlinear polarization observations of star forming regions. Dust polarization is believed to be\nperpendicular to the magnetic field under most conditions (Lazarian 2003); hence, dust\npolarization has been used as a major probe for the magnetic field geometry. In order to\nefficiently measure the dust polarization and infer information about the magnetic field morphology, high resolution observations are required. The BIMA millimeter interferometer has\nbeen used to obtain high-resolution maps in several star forming cores (Rao et al. 1998;\nGirart & Crutcher 1999; Lai et al. 2001, 2002, 2003). These results show fairly uniform\npolarization morphologies over the main continuum sources, suggesting that magnetic fields\nare strong, and therefore, should not be ignored in star formation theory.\nThe linear polarization of spectral line radiation from the molecular gas has been suggested to occur under anisotropic conditions (Goldreich & Kylafis 1981a). The prediction\nis that linearly polarized radiation of a few percent is likely to be detected from molecular\nclouds and circumstellar envelopes in the presence of a magnetic field. The direction of this\npolarization should be either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field, depending on\nthe angles between the line of sight, the magnetic field, and the direction associated with the\nanisotropic excitation (Goldreich & Kylafis 1981b). This process is known as the Goldreich\n- Kylafis effect. Combining this effect with observation of the polarized emission from dust\ngrains, we can probe the magnetic field morphology in the plane of the sky.\nWe observed the young and massive star forming region DR21(OH). We measured dust\npolarization at 3 mm and the CO J = 1 \u2192 0 line polarization. These observations were\ncompared with the Lai et al. (2003) polarization observations at 1 mm and CO J = 2 \u2192 1,\nparticularly the line polarization that has more extended emission than the dust. We found\na 90\u25e6 difference in the position angle when comparing the line polarization data for the two\ntransitions. This difference motivated a numerical study to explore polarized line emission\norientation in different transitions.\nThe paper is divided into three major sections. In Section 2 we discuss the source\nand observation procedure, the line and dust polarization observations, and the comparison\nwith the Lai et al. (2003) results. The numerical calculational procedure and results are\ndescribed in Section 3. Section 4 contains the discussion and summary.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n2.1.\n\nSource description\n\nDR21(OH) is a young massive star forming region located in the -3 km s\u22121 DR21/W75S\nmolecular cloud complex, centered at RA: 20:39:00.7 and DEC: 42:22:46.7 (J2000 coordinates). This region is also at the north-eastern part of the giant Cygnus-X H II complex.\nThe distance to DR21(OH) is assumed to be 3 kpc; however, the value is uncertain. Dickel\net al. (1978) used a value of 2 kpc. From thermal emission of dust Woody et al. (1989)\nresolved two compact cores in DR21(OH), MM1 and MM2, with a total mass of \u223c 125 M\u2299 .\nThe MM1 component is the brighter one, with an integrated flux of 0.27 Jy at 2.72 mm\n(Mangum et al. 1991). DR21(OH) has been extensively mapped in CO by Dickel et al.\n(1978); Woody et al. (1989); Mangum et al. (1991); Chandler et al. (1993), and in CS by\nPlambeck & Menten (1990) and Chandler et al. (1993). DR21(OH) is also known for its association with maser emission from OH (Norris et al. 1982), H2 O (Genzel & Downes 1977)\nand CH3 OH (Batrla & Menten 1988; Plambeck & Menten 1990). DR21(OH) has also been\nobserved in the far-infrared (Williams et al. 1974; Harvey et al. 1986) and sub-millimeter\n(Gear et al. 1988; Richardson et al. 1994). No centimeter-wavelength continuum sources\nhave been observed in DR21(OH) (Johnston et al. 1984); therefore, HII regions have not\nyet developed, so it appears to be in an early stage of evolution. This makes DR21(OH) a\ngood candidate for early star formation and magnetic field studies.\nMagnetic field observations have been carried out measuring Zeeman splittings. The\nCN line Zeeman splitting has been detected in both cores (the CN line traces nH2 \u223c 105-106\ncm\u22123 ) giving a line-of-sight magnetic field strength, Blos of -0.4 mG for MM1 and -0.7 mG for\nMM2 (Crutcher 1999a). Lai et al. (2003) observed the CO J = 2 \u2192 1 molecular line and\nthe 1.3 mm dust continuum simultaneously using the BIMA array. They obtained a detailed\npolarization map for the whole region. Their results show a remarkably uniform polarization\npattern for the line over the main two continuum sources, while the dust polarization appears\nto be mostly perpendicular to the line. These results seem to be consistent with theoretical\npredictions.\n\n2.2.\n\nObservation procedure\n\nWe observed DR21(OH) from October to November 2001, mapping the continuum emission at 3 mm and the CO J = 1 \u2192 0 molecular line (at 115.2712 GHz), using the BIMA\narray in C configuration. We set the digital correlator in mode 8 to observe both the continuum and the CO J = 1 \u2192 0 line simultaneously. The 750 MHz lower side band was\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ncombined with 700 MHz from the upper side band to map the continuum emission, leaving\na 50 MHz window for the CO line observation (at a resolution of 2.06 km s\u22121 ). Each BIMA\ntelescope has a single receiver and thus the two polarizations must be observed sequentially.\nA quarter wave plate to select either R or L circular polarization is alternately switched in to\nthe signal path ahead of the receiver. Switching between polarizations was sufficiently rapid\n(every 11.5 seconds) to give essentially identical uv-coverage. Cross-correlating the right (R)\nand left (L) circularly polarized signals from the sky gave RR, LL, LR, and RL for each\ninterferometer baseline, from which maps in the four Stokes parameters were produced. The\ninstrumental polarization was calibrated by observing 3c279, and the \"leakages\" solutions\nwere calculated from these observations. The phase calibrator used was BL Lac. We used\nthe same calibration procedure described by Lai et al. (2001).\nThe Stokes images I, U, Q and V were obtained by Fourier transforming the visibility\ndata using natural weighting. The 3 mm continuum synthesized beam had a major axis of\n8.4\" and a minor axis of 6.9\", with a position angle (P.A.) of 35\u25e6 . The MIRIAD (Sault &\nKileen 1995) package was used for data reduction.\n\n2.3.\n\n3 mm Continuum results\n\nOur 3 mm continuum results did not resolve the two continuum sources (MM1 and MM2)\nresolved by Lai et al. (2003). The larger beam at 3 mm gives poorer resolution than the 1.3\nmm observations (with BIMA at the same configuration). Our 3 mm continuum observations\n\u2032\nhave a peak emission of 0.22 Jy beam\u22121 , centered at 20h 39m 00s .7 RA and 42\u25e6 22 46\" .7 DEC\nin J2000 coordinates. This center coincides roughly with the center of the MM1 continuum\nsource. Johnston et al. (1984) found no continuum emission at 14.5 GHz from DR21(OH).\nTherefore we assume that free-free emission is negligible and all the continuum radiation\ncomes from dust emission. The peak emission is consistent with Mangum et al. (1991), who\nobtained 0.192 Jy beam\u22121 at 2.7 mm with a comparable beam size.\nPolarization detection is very sensitive to the signal to noise ratio. Because of bad\nweather conditions during part of our observations we did not achieve the same level of\npolarization sensitivity as Lai et al. (2003) did. We have 3\u03c3 polarization detections (figure\n1) scattered over 3 positions in the map. The dust polarization detected is consistent with\nthe result of Lai et al. (2003).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.4.\n\nCO J = 1 \u2192 0 Observational results\n\nFigure 2 shows the Stokes I spectra integrated over a region that contains the MM1\nand MM2 sources (Lai et al. 2003). This region covers the box from RA: 20h 39m 2s 20h 38m 59s .5 to DEC:42\u25e6 22'35\" - 42\u25e6 23'2\". Plotted over the Stokes I are the P.A. and the\nfractional polarization at each velocity channel. The Stokes I spectra generally agree with\nthe CO J = 2 \u2192 1 spectra from Lai et al. (2003). In our case the spectrum has a peak\nat vlsr = \u22128 km s\u22121 , a minimum at vlsr = \u22122 km s\u22121 , and a second peak at vlsr = 2 km\ns\u22121 . The velocity of these peaks are different from previous CS and CN observations, which\nare at -5 km s\u22121 (Chandler et al. 1993; Richardson et al. 1994), and -5 km s\u22121 and -1\nkm s\u22121 (Crutcher 1999a). The CO line is optically thick (Figure 2) and the dip, or zero\nemission range, observed in both CO J = 2 \u2192 1 and J = 1 \u2192 0 lines, is probably due\nto self-absorption. In CO J = 1 \u2192 0, the dip covers a velocity range from -6 km s\u22121 to 2\nkm s\u22121 which coincides with the C34 S J = 2 \u2192 1 emission peak range from Chandler et al.\n(1993), which goes from -6 km s\u22121 to 1.5 km s\u22121 . In the same velocity range 13 CO emission\nwas detected (Dickel et al. 1978) from -3 km s\u22121 to 0.5 km s\u22121 . C34 S traces higher densities\nthan CO, and 13 CO is more optically thin than CO. The presence of peak emission from\nthese lines in the same velocity range of our dip suggests that our CO observations may\ncome from a different region from the higher density gas (which probably comes from the\ncore). Additionally, it is expected that CO polarized line emission will arise from optically\nthin regions (\u03c4 \u223c 1) (Goldreich & Kylafis 1981a; Deguchi & Watson 1984). Therefore, it\nis likely that the CO polarized emission that we detected comes from an envelope around\nDR21(OH).\nFigure 3 shows our CO polarization map at vlsr =-8 km s\u22121 . This map represents the\nhighest significance polarization distribution in our observations. It also coincides with the\npeak emission of the CO. Figure 4 shows our polarization map at vlsr =-10 km s\u22121 , which is\nthe same velocity map presented by Lai et al. (2003). In our case the vlsr =-10 km s\u22121 map\ndoes not present the same spatial distribution of polarization as the -8 km s\u22121 map, almost\ncertainly due to the limited sensitivity of the polarization data. Table 1 gives a comparison\nbetween P.A. for both CO transitions. We can see that there is a consistent 90\u25e6 difference\nbetween the transitions.\n\n2.5.\n\nComparison between CO J = 1 \u2192 0 and CO J = 2 \u2192 1 polarization\n\nLai et al. (2003) presented a single velocity channel map of their line polarization\nobservations (at vlsr = \u221210 km s\u22121 ); this is the velocity of the peak value in the Stokes I\nemission. Our CO J = 1 \u2192 0 observations have a peak Stokes I at vlsr = \u22128 km s\u22121 (Figure\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3 ), which also coincides with our most complete polarization spatial distribution.\nThe Lai et al. (2003) map shows distributed CO emission that is more extensive than\nthe region of the 1.3 mm continuum sources. We see a similar situation in our observations\n(Figure 3). We also see that our line polarization has better coverage over the CO emission\nthan the Lai et al. (2003) observations (Figure 4). Our observations seem to indicate that\nwith better signal to noise, it might be possible to achieve complete polarization coverage\nover the region of CO emission. The maximum polarized intensity coincides with the position\nof the continuum source, a fact which suggests the importance of a continuum radiation field\nin polarizing the line emission. This was studied in our numerical calculation.\nComparing polarization vectors from Figure 3 and Figure 4 with the map presented by\nLai et al. (2003), we found that the P.A. differ; in the central region in both maps most\nof the P.A. are orthogonal. This is a rather unexpected discovery. The Goldreich - Kylafis\neffect predicts that polarization can be either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field\n(Goldreich & Kylafis 1981a), but did not make a distinction between polarization of the\nsame molecule at different transitions. This is because their calculation was done simulating\na 2-level molecule. Deguchi & Watson (1984) extended the calculation to a multilevel\nmolecule, but made no prediction about polarization direction in different transitions. Direct\ncomparison of angles in Table 1 shows the 90\u25e6 difference between both CO transitions. This\nis particularly true in the central part of the map.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nPolarization of molecular lines\nThe Goldreich - Kylafis effect\n\nThe Goldreich - Kylafis effect is described in a series of papers (Goldreich & Kylafis\n1981a,b; Kylafis 1983a,b). They considered a molecule with only two (rotational) states\nhaving angular momenta 1 and 0, and investigated line formation and polarization in the\npresence of a magnetic field and anisotropic optical depths. Their original work predicted\nlinear polarization up to about ten per cent. Motivated in part by an unsuccessful observational survey for this polarization (Wannier et al. 1983), Deguchi & Watson (1984)\nextended the calculations to include a number of rotational states and radiative transitions.\nAs a result, the predicted linear polarizations were reduced, typically by a factor of about\ntwo. We have further extended the multilevel calculations by including an external source\nterm to represent emission from dust in a compact source. We have also used improved rates\nfor collisional excitation, though this proved to be unimportant. We focus on calculations\nto understand the polarization angles of the CO J = 2 \u2192 1 and J = 1 \u2192 0 transitions\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nobserved in DR21(OH).\n\n3.2.\n\nBasic methods\n\nThe formulation used here follows Deguchi & Watson (1984). The radiative transfer\nequations are solved in the large velocity gradient or Sobolev approximation (hereafter LVG),\nand in the regime where the line width \u2206\u03bd, the Zeeman splitting g\u03bc0 B, and the natural line\nwidth \u03b3 obey the relation \u2206\u03bd \u226b g\u03bc0B \u226b \u03b3. This strong inequality is easily satisfied here.\nThe quantization z axis is along the magnetic field direction, and the quantum states are\nspecified in the usual way by the total angular momentum J (there is no fine or hyperfine\nstructure here) and by its projection M on the z axis. Under these conditions the radiative\ntransfer equations for radiation associated with transitions between upper state J and lower\nstate J \u2032 can be written as\n\n\u22a5\ndIJJ\n\u2032\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n= \u2212\u03ba\u22a5\nJJ \u2032 (IJJ \u2032 \u2212 SJJ \u2032 )\nds\nk\ndIJJ \u2032\nk\nk\nk\n= \u2212\u03baJJ \u2032 (IJJ \u2032 \u2212 SJJ \u2032 )\nds\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere k (\u22a5) indicates the intensity of the radiation with a linear polarization parallel (perpendicular) to the magnetic field.\nThe difference with Goldreich & Kylafis (1981a) comes in expressing the opacity and\nsource terms in a way to allow for arbitrary angular momenta. The opacity and source terms\nq\nare thus written as \u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032 and SJM J \u2032 M \u2032 such that \u03baqJJ \u2032 and SJJ\n\u2032 (where q stands for k or\n\u22a5),\n\n!\nX\n1\n\u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032\n\u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032 + cos2 \u03b8\n= \u03c6(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdJJ \u2032 ) sin2 \u03b8\n2\n\u2206M =1\n\u2206M =0\nP\nP\nsin2 \u03b8 \u2206M =0 \u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032 SJM J \u2032 M \u2032 + 12 cos2 \u03b8 \u2206M =1 \u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032 SJM J \u2032 M \u2032\n=\nP\nP\nsin2 \u03b8 \u2206M =0 \u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032 + 21 cos2 (\u03b8) \u2206M =1 \u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032\n\nk\n\u03baJJ \u2032\n\nk\n\nSJJ \u2032\n\nX\n1\n\u03ba\u22a5\n\u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032\nJJ \u2032 = \u03c6(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdJJ \u2032 )\n2\n\u2206M =1\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032S\n\u03ba\n\u22a5\n\u2206M\nP=1 JM J M JM J M\nSJJ\n=\n\u2032\n\u2206M =1 \u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032\nX\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwhere the symbol \u03b8 represents the angle between the magnetic field and the direction of\npropagation and \u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032 and SJM J \u2032M \u2032 are defined in terms of Einstein A-coefficients and\nthe populations nJM per magnetic substate\n\n\u03baJM J \u2032 M \u2032\nSJM J \u2032 M \u2032\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\nc\n3\nAJM J \u2032 M \u2032 (nJ \u2032 M \u2032 \u2212 nJM )\n=\n8\u03c0 \u03bdJJ \u2032\nh\u03bd 3 \u2032\nnJM\n= JJ\n.\n2\nc nJ \u2032 M \u2032 \u2212 nJM\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nSome equations here differ slightly from those in Deguchi & Watson (1984) because we are\ntreating all magnetic substates explicitly. All statistical weight factors are one and are thus\nomitted for simplicity.\nSince the radiative transfer equations are functions of the populations, rate equations\ni\n= 0. The rate equations\nmust be solved for these populations.

The indices i, j correspond to\n(J, M), (J \u2032 , M \u2032 ). The Cij are the collisional excitation rates from state i to state j. Deguchi\n& Watson (1984) used the Cij given by Green & Chapman (1978). In our calculation\nwe have updated the values of Cij with the values provided by Flower (2001), which are\ngiven for a wide range of gas temperatures. We used a weighted average for the contribution\nof ortho and para hydrogen cross sections, specifically, Cij = 0.7 \u00d7 Cijpara + 0.3 \u00d7 Cijortho .\nWe considered temperatures up to Tgas = 200K and angular momenta up to J = 9. The\nexpressions for the Pij are\nPij = Aij [ni + Rij (\u2212nj + ni )].\n\n(10)\n\nThe population equations constitute a nonlinear system, which we solve by numerical iteration.\nIn the limit in which the macroscopic velocity differences of the gas in the cloud are\ngreater than the thermal velocities of the molecules, the LVG approximation can be used to\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nsimplify the solution for the radiative transfer equations. The LVG approximation expresses\nthe intensity as a function of local variables.

In the calculation, the constant L0 enters multiplied by the total number density of\nCO molecules. We vary this product to obtain the solutions as a function of optical depth\nthat are presented in the Figures.\nThe Rij in equation 10 involve the integral over frequency and over solid angle of the\nintensity within the cloud at the location of the CO, and are non-zero only for |J \u2212 J \u2032 | = 1,\n|M \u2212 M \u2032 | = 0 and |M \u2212 M \u2032 | = 1 (Deguchi & Watson 1984),\n0\nRJJ\n\u2032\n\n3c2\n=\n2h\u03bd 3\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a9 2\nsin \u03b8\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nk\n\nd\u03bd\u03c6(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdJJ \u2032 )IJJ \u2032 (\u03a9)\n\nZ\nZ\n3c2\nd\u03a9\nk\n2\n\u22a5\n=\nd\u03bd\u03c6(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdJJ \u2032 )[IJJ\n\u2032 (\u03a9) + cos \u03b8IJJ \u2032 (\u03a9)].\n3\n4h\u03bd\n4\u03c0\nIn the LVG approximation the integrals over frequency reduce to\n1\nRJJ\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nq\nq\nq\nIJJ\n\u2032 \u03c6(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdJJ \u2032 )d\u03bd = SJJ \u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03b2JJ \u2032 ) +\n\nB + S(\u03a9) q\n\u03b2JJ \u2032\n2\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nq\nq\nq\nin which the escape probability function is \u03b2JJ\n\u2032 = [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c4JJ \u2032 )]/\u03c4JJ \u2032 , and S(\u03a9) represents\nthe radiation that is incident from a compact, external continuum source.

In equation 17, B\u03bd (Tsource ) is the Planck function, Tsource\nis the source temperature, and \u03c4c is the continuum optical depth of the source at the relevant\nfrequency. We adopted the parameterization of Mangum et al. (1991) for the combined\nemission from the dust core of DR21(OH), specifically, Tsource = 42 K, \u03c4c =1.5[0.25/\u03bb[mm]]2\nand an effective source angular size (radius) of 10\u2032\u2032 as seen from the earth. At the location of\nthe CO, the angular size (radius) for the source is then approximately 1/2 radian (assuming\n0.3 pc for the separation between the CO and the source). Finally, the fractional polarization\nis expressed as\nP =\n\n3.3.\n\nI\u22a5 \u2212 Ik\n.\nI\u22a5 + Ik\n\n(18)\n\nCalculation results\n\nThe objective of this calculation is to understand why the the directions of the polarizations for the CO J = 1 \u2192 0 and the CO J = 2 \u2192 1 radiation are perpendicular to\none another in the DR21(OH) observations described in Section 2, with the J = 1 \u2192 0\npolarization parallel to that of the emission by the dust grains. We want to calculate the\nlinearly polarized radiation emitted by CO for physical conditions that are representative\nfor the DR21(OH) star forming region, and determine whether the observed directions and\nmagnitudes of the polarization can be reproduced. The orthogonality of the polarizations is\nreflected by a sign difference in P in equation 18 . If P > 0, I\u22a5 dominates the emission and\nthe polarization is perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the other case it is parallel.\nThe physical conditions for our multilevel calculation are described below. These conditions are consistent with the assumption that the polarized emission comes from a cold\nenvelope around the DR21(OH) continuum sources. We assumed that the physical conditions\nare the same in the gas for both CO transitions.\nTo obtain a qualitative understanding of how the polarizations can be orthogonal for the\ntwo transitions, consider the J = 1 \u2192 0 transition by itself, and first without any external\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nradiation. If the velocity gradients are smaller in directions parallel to the magnetic field\nthan in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field, the optical depths for spectral lines\nwill be the largest parallel to the field lines. The escape of radiation involved in de-exciting\nthe upper J = 1 state will then be reduced more in directions along the field lines than in\ndirections perpendicular to the field lines. This in turn leads to populations of the M = \u00b11\nsubstates that are larger than the populations of the M = 0 substate because of the difference\nin the angular distributions of the de-exciting radiation. The angular distribution of the \u03c3\nradiation (|M \u2212 M \u0301| = 1 transitions) peaks in directions along the field lines whereas that of\nthe \u03c0 radiation (|M \u2212 M \u0301| = 0 transitions) peaks in directions perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield. Hence, when the velocity gradients are smallest along the magnetic field, the rate for deexcitation of the M = \u00b11 substates is decreased more by trapping of the radiation than is the\nde-excitation rate of the M = 0 substate . The excitation rate for all magnetic substates by\ncollisions is the same. Under isotropic conditions, the populations of the magnetic substates\nare equal. For any direction, the \u03c3 and \u03c0 radiation that emerges from the radiative decays\nof these states will combine to give zero net polarization. However, when the M = \u00b11 states\nhave larger populations, the \u03c3 radiation will be relatively stronger in comparison with the\n\u03c0 radiation. Their contributions to the polarization will not then cancel and the combined\nradiation will be linearly polarized-in the direction of the polarization of the \u03c3 radiation\nwhich is perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nNow consider by itself a compact, external source of radiation (i. e., no anisotropy in the\noptical depths as in the above paragraph) that is located in a direction perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field. Because the angular distribution associated with \u03c0 transitions is larger for\nthis direction than is the angular distribution of the \u03c3 transitions, the J = 1, M = 0 substate\nwill be excited more rapidly by absorption of this radiation than will be the J = 1, M = \u00b11\nsubstates. The J = 1, M = 0 substate would then become overpopulated in comparison\nwith the other two magnetic substates and radiation that emerges from the gas would be\npolarized in the direction of \u03c0 radiation-parallel to the magnetic field.\nThough the reasoning is more complicated because of the additional substates and\ntransitions, analogous conclusions apply for the polarization of the radiation associated with\nthe J = 2 \u2192 1 and higher transitions of the CO molecule.\nWhen the above anisotropic velocity gradients and external source of radiation are\nboth present, the direction of the polarization of the radiation that is emitted by the gas\nis determined by the relative importance of these two causes of anisotropy. Their relative\nimportance is not, however, the same for the J = 2 \u2192 1 as for the J = 1 \u2192 0 transition. The\ndust radiation from the core of DR21(OH) is much higher at the CO J = 2 \u2192 1 transition\nfrequency than the CO J = 1 \u2192 0 frequency, and thus the external radiation will play a\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ngreater role for the polarization of the J = 2 \u2192 1 transition than it does for the J = 1 \u2192 0\ntransition. The effect of the anisotropic velocity gradients is about the same for the two\ntransitions since the collisional excitation rates are about the same for both transitions (the\nexcitation energies for these states of CO are less than kTgas ). The J = 2 \u2192 1 radiation can\nthen reflect the influence of the radiation and be polarized parallel to the magnetic field under\nconditions for which the J = 1 \u2192 0 radiation reflects the influence of the velocity gradient\nand is polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field. The results presented below from the\nnumerical calculations demonstrate that this orthogonality in the polarizations occurs for\nphysical conditions that are likely for the gas that is emitting the polarized CO radiation\nfrom DR21(OH). Velocity gradients that are anisotropic and systematically larger in the\ndirection perpendicular to the magnetic field occur in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence\n(see Watson et al. (2004))\nCalculations were performed for gas temperatures between 15 and 50 K and for a range of\ndensities. Dickel et al. (1978) obtained a Tgas =28 K; this temperature is used as a reference\nfor our calculations. The velocity gradient must be largest in the direction perpendicular\nto the magnetic field according to the above reasoning. We thus focus on \u03b1 = 0.1 in the\nexpression for L(\u03b8), though we also present results for \u03b1=0.3 for comparison.\nThree curves for polarization versus LVG optical depth that correspond to calculations\nwith densities nH2 = 25, 75 and 225 cm\u22123 are shown in Figure 5 for Tgas = 28 K. These\ndensities are in agreement with what we might expect in a lower density envelope. Padin\net al. (1989) obtained a nH2 density of nH2 = 5 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 , but this corresponds to the\nMM1 continuum source and not to the DR21(OH) envelope. At the lowest optical depths,\nthe external continuum source dominates in determining the direction of the polarization\nfor both transitions whereas at the highest optical depths this radiation is largely excluded\nand the velocity gradient determines the direction of the polarization for both transitions.\nHowever, because the continuum emission from the core of DR21(OH) is much higher at the\nfrequency of the J = 2 \u2192 1 transition than at the frequency of the J = 1 \u2192 0, the external\nradiation remains more important to higher optical depths for the J = 2 \u2192 1 transition\nthan for the J = 1 \u2192 0. Hence, a range of optical depths occurs over which the polarizations\nare orthogonal. This range of optical depths is mostly from log(\u03c4 ) \u2243 0 to \u22121 in Figure\n5. In this range of optical depths, the fractional polarizations typically are a few percent\nand are thus consistent with the observed magnitudes for the fractional polarizations of the\ntwo transitions. These small \u03c4 values are consistent with our assumption that the polarized\nCO emission arises from a cold, low density gas, which in turn is compatible with the\nlikely conditions for the DR21(OH) envelope. At the highest optical depths, the fractional\npolarization tends to zero in Figure 5 for both transitions as expected. The polarizations\nin the second panel in Figure 5 (for \u03b1=0.3) provide an indication of the sensitivity of the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\ncalculations to the magnitude of the velocity gradients. The polarizations for both transitions\nare presented only as a function of the CO J = 1 \u2192 0 optical depth. However, the CO\nJ = 2 \u2192 1 optical depth is similar in our calculations.\nThe curves in Figure 5 correspond to the densities that represent our best results. Our\ncalculations show that for densities over nH2 =500 cm\u22123 the fractional polarization decreases\ndramatically for both lines, vanishing almost completely for densities over nH2 =1000 cm\u22123 .\nAt the higher densities collisions are more rapid and the continuum source is no longer an\nimportant source of anisotropy. On the other hand, densities below nH2 =20 cm\u22123 would\nrequire an envelope too big and far away from the continuum source, which would make the\ncentral continuum source ineffective as an additional source of anisotropy.\nIn Figure 6, we demonstrate explicitly that the polarization is positive for both transitions at all optical depths in our calculations when there is no continuum source so that the\nvelocity gradients determine the direction of the polarization. The fractional polarization\nalso tends to zero at large and at small optical depths as expected, and as found by the\nprevious investigators.\nIn Figure 7, we present the results of our calculations for the other extreme; the limit in\nwhich the radiation from the continuum source dominates. We cannot eliminate collisions\ncompletely in our calculations. However, we can greatly reduce their influence by multiplying\nthe collision rates by a small factor (10\u22125 ). As expected, the polarization is now negative for\nboth lines (parallel to the magnetic field), is independent of density and converges to zero\nfor higher optical depths.\nIn our calculations, we also varied the gas temperature in order to explore the influence\nof uncertainty about the gas temperature in the envelope around DR21(OH). We found no\nsignificant variation in the polarizations for Tgas between 15 and 50 K. What we found is\nthat the range in \u03c4 for which the polarizations are orthogonal shifts slightly in \u03c4 ; there is a\ndisplacement to lower \u03c4 for higher temperatures. A molecular envelope might be heated by\nexternal UV photons or cosmic rays. This insensitivity to gas temperature shows a degree\nof robustness for the results of our calculations. We have also verified that the results are\ninsensitive to the temperature of the dust by performing computations with Tsource up to 60\nK.\nThe polarizations presented in Figures 5-7 are for the radiation that is emitted by the gas\nat an angle of 90\u25e6 with respect to the magnetic field. We have verified that the polarization\ncharacteristics are similar for emission at angles from 90\u25e6 to about 40\u25e6 . At smaller angles,\nthe polarized fraction decreases significantly-approaching zero at 0\u25e6 , as expected.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n3.4.\n\nMagnetic field strength and cloud support\n\nOur work has shown that the line polarization will trace magnetic field geometry at\nlower densities than the dust polarization. However, comparing with the results of Lai et al.\n(2003), we believe that there is a correlation between the field traced by the dust (core) and\nthe field traced by the line (envelope). Our dust polarization result at 3 mm shows similar\nP.A. to the 1.3 mm dust polarization of Lai et al. (2003). Also we now know why the line\npolarizations are perpendicular at two different transitions, which makes the CO J = 1 \u2192 0\npolarization consistent with the CO J = 2 \u2192 1. At different frequencies the line polarization\nis either parallel or perpendicular to the dust polarization. The agreement in the geometries\nof the dust and line polarization suggests that the field in the core and the envelope are\nconnected and not independent.\nLai et al. (2003) estimated the magnetic field strength to be about 0.9 mG for MM1\n(nH2 \u223c 1\u00d7106 cm\u22123 ) and 1.3 mG for MM2 (nH2 \u223c 2\u00d7106 cm\u22123 ). Crutcher (1999a) measured\na magnetic field in the line of sight Blos \u223c -0.4 mG for MM1 and Blos \u223c -0.7 mG for MM2.\nChandrasekhar & Fermi (1953) predicted a magnetic field dependence proportional to \u03c11/2\np\n\u2206vlos\nBChF = Q 4\u03c0\u03c1\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n(19)\n\nThe dispersions in the measured velocities and P.A. are similar for the J = 1 \u2192 0 and\nJ = 2 \u2192 1 lines. Therefore, we can extrapolate the values of the magnetic field measured in\nthe core to the envelope following a \u03c11/2 law. The molecular hydrogen number density for\nthe cores is in the order of nH2 = 106 cm\u22123 , and taking a density of nH2 = 100 cm\u22123 for the\nenvelope, we get a magnetic field in the envelope 100 times smaller than the core value of \u223c\n1 mG (at nH2 \u223c 1 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 ), or about 10 \u03bcG. We can use this value to estimate the mass\nto magnetic flux ratio; its critical value is given by (Mouschovias & Spitzer 1976)\n1\nM\n=\u221a\n\u03a6B crit\n63G\n\n(20)\n\nThis equation can be expressed as a function of volume density in an spherical model, using\nthe molecular hydrogen mass, equation 20, and expressing the magnetic field in G units, and\nthe distance in cm. We arrived at\nR[cm] \u00d7 n[cm\u22123 ]\nM/\u03a6\n= 9.1 \u00d7 10\u221227\nM/\u03a6 crit\nB[G]\n\n(21)\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nin which R is the radius of the cloud, n is the number density of hydrogen molecules and B\nis the magnetic field. Using a density n =100 cm\u22123 , B=10 \u03bcG and a radius of R=0.3 pc,\nwe obtained a mass-to-flux ratio of 0.13 times the critical value, and thus highly subcritical.\nHence, the envelope is supported against gravitational contraction by the magnetic field. The\nvalue of R represents an angular distance of 0.3 pc of distance for DR21(OH). This radius\nmay be underestimated due to resolution of more extended structure by the interferometer.\nHowever, single dish maps (Wilson & Mauersberger 1990) suggest that R < 1 pc.\n\n4.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nDR21(OH) was observed in 3 mm dust continuum and CO J = 1 \u2192 0 line emission.\nComparing our line observations with Lai et al. (2003), we observed a consistent difference\nin polarization direction between the CO J = 2 \u2192 1 and CO J = 1 \u2192 0 lines; they are\nperpendicular to each other over the central region (which coincides with the position of\nthe MM1 and MM2 continuum sources). We developed a code based on the Deguchi &\nWatson (1984) calculation in order to solve the radiative transfer equations and calculate\nthe fractional linear polarization for different transitions of the CO molecule. We found that\nthe presence of a small continuum source will likely produce an increase in the anisotropy of\nthe radiation field over the CO gas. An anisotropic radiation field will unevenly populate the\nmagnetic sub-levels of the CO molecule, which will produce linearly polarized emission. We\nshowed that the presence of a compact continuum source will produce a gradual change in the\nfractional polarization, with a sign change, as a function of optical depth. This would explain\nthe orthogonal orientations of the CO polarization in different transitions. In the particular\ncase of DR21(OH), the physical conditions that are consistent with the polarization data\ncorrespond to a hot continuum source (Tdust \u223c 42 K) and a CO gas temperature of Tgas \u223c\n28 K, for a nH2 \u223c100 cm\u22123 .\nLine polarization observations can become a powerful tool to constrain the magnetic field\ngeometry. We have seen that a clear understanding of the physical conditions in a molecular\ncloud will give more accurate information about the fractional polarization sign. A good\nknowledge of the sources of anisotropy in a cloud will help to understand and constraint the\ngeometry in line polarization observations at multiple frequencies.\nWe also found that line polarization traces low density material; this is important in\norder to connect the magnetic field geometries at different densities. In the particular case of\nDR21(OH) we believe that there may be a correlation between the field traced by the dust\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nat densities of 106 cm\u22123 and the field traced by line polarization at 102 - 103 cm\u22123 . However,\nwe were only able to compare our calculation with polarization observations of CO molecular\ntransitions. We believe that polarization information from additional molecules may probe\nthe magnetic field geometry at intermediate densities giving a more accurate picture of the\nfield morphology in star forming regions.\nHaving information about the magnetic field at different densities is useful to test\nthe gravitational state of equilibrium for the cloud. Polarization mapping can allow the\nChandrasekhar-Fermi method to be used to obtain an estimate of the magnetic field strength\nand test whether the envelope is magnetically supported or not. The envelope of DR21(OH)\nappears to be magnetically supported.\nThis research has been supported partially by NSF grants AST 02-05810 and AST\n99-88104.\n\nREFERENCES\nBarvainis, R., & Wooten, A., 1987.
