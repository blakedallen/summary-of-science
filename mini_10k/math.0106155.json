Introduction\nThis paper discusses the existence of finite-dimensional forward rate models\nwithin the framework of Heath, Jarrow and Morton (henceforth HJM) [10]. Following Musiela [15], we denote by rt (x) the instantaneous forward rate at time t\nfor maturity t + x. The price at time t of a zero coupon bond with maturity T is\nthen given by\n!\nZ T \u2212t\nrt (x) dx .\nP (t, T ) = exp \u2212\n0\n\nIt is shown in [6] that essentially any HJM-type model for rt (x) can be considered\nas a stochastic equation\n(\ndrt = (Art + \u03b1HJM (t, rt )) dt + \u03c3(t, rt ) dWt\n(1.1)\nr0 = h0\non a separable Hilbert space H which is characterized by the following three properties:\n(H1) H \u2282 C(R\u22650 ; R) with continuous embedding1 ; that is, the pointwise evaluations\nevx : h 7\u2192 h(x) are continuous linear functionals.\nDate: December 11, 2000 (first draft); October 24, 2018 (this draft).\nH consists of equivalence classes of functions, which we shall identify with their\ncontinuous representatives, respectively.\n1 Typically,\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAMIR FILIPOVI\u0106 AND JOSEF TEICHMANN\n\n(H2) The family of right-shifts, S(t)f (x) = f (t + x), forms a strongly continuous\nsemigroup {S(t) | t \u2208 R\u22650 } on H.\n(H3) There exists a closed subspace H0 of H such that\nZ x\ng(\u03b7) d\u03b7,\nS(f, g)(x) := f (x)\n0\n\ndefines a continuous bilinear mapping S : H0 \u00d7 H0 \u2192 H.\n\nWe write shortly S(f ) for S(f, f ).\nAs an illustration we shall always have the following example in mind (see [6,\nSection 5]).\nExample 1. Let w : R\u22650 \u2192 [1, \u221e) be a non-decreasing C 1 -function such that\nw\u22121/3 \u2208 L1 (R\u22650 ). We may think of w(x) = e\u03b1x or w(x) = (1 + x)\u03b1 , for \u03b1 > 0 or\n\u03b1 > 3, respectively. The space Hw consisting of absolutely continuous functions h\non R\u22650 and equipped with the norm\nZ\n2\n2\nkhkw := |h(0)| +\n|h\u2032 (x)|2 w(x) dx\nR\u22650\n\nis a Hilbert space which satisfies (H1)\u2013(H2). Property (H3) is satisfied for H0 =\nHw0 := {h \u2208 Hw | limx\u2192\u221e h(x) = 0}.\nThroughout we are given a filtered probability space (\u03a9, F , (Ft ), P) satisfying\nthe usual conditions. The predictable \u03c3-field is denoted by P. Now we can give\na meaning to the coefficients in (1.1). Here W = (W 1 , . . . , W d ), d \u2208 N, denotes\na standard d-dimensional Brownian motion. The volatility coefficient \u03c3(t, \u03c9, h) =\n(\u03c3 1 (t, \u03c9, h), . . . , \u03c3 d (t, \u03c9, h)) is a measurable mapping from (R\u22650 \u00d7 \u03a9 \u00d7 H, P \u2297 B(H))\ninto (H0d , B(H0d)), well-defining\n\u03b1HJM (t, \u03c9, h) :=\n\nd\nX\n\nS(\u03c3 j (t, \u03c9, h)),\n\nj=1\n\na measurable mapping from (R\u22650 \u00d7 \u03a9 \u00d7 H, P \u2297 B(H)) into (H, B(H)).\nThe operator A is the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup {S(t) | t \u2208 R\u22650 }.\nIts domain in H is denoted by D(A), and we write A\u2217 for its adjoint. Both operators, A and A\u2217 , are closed. It is easy to see that D(A) \u2282 {h \u2208 H \u2229 C 1 (R\u22650 ; R) |\nh\u2032 \u2208 H} and Ah = h\u2032 . Without much loss of generality we shall in fact assume\n(H4) D(A) = {h \u2208 H \u2229 C 1 (R\u22650 ; R) | h\u2032 \u2208 H}.\nAlso (H4) is satisfied for the spaces Hw from Example 1.\nWe distinguish, in decreasing order of generality, between (local) mild, weak\nand strong solutions to equation (1.1) and its time-shifted versions. The reader is\nreferred to [5] or [6] for the precise definitions.\nDefinition 1. A subset V of H is called locally invariant for (1.1) if, for all spacetime initial points (t0 , h0 ) \u2208 R\u22650 \u00d7 V , there exists a continuous local weak solution\nr(t0 ,h0 ) to (1.1) with lifetime \u03c4 = \u03c4 (t0 , h0 ) such that\n(t ,h0 )\n\n0\nrt\u2227\u03c4\n\n\u2208 V,\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R\u22650 .\n\nFor the notion of a finite-dimensional C k -submanifold of a Hilbert space we refer\nto [13]. We restate [8, Theorem 3].\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1. Suppose that \u03c3(t, \u03c9, h) is continuously differentiable in h and rightcontinuous in t. Let M be an m-dimensional C 2 -submanifold of H. Then the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent:\ni) M is locally invariant for (1.1)\nii) M \u2282 D(A) and\nd\n\n\u03bc(t, \u03c9, h) := Ah + \u03b1HJM (t, \u03c9, h) \u2212\n\n1X\nD\u03c3 j (t, \u03c9, h)\u03c3 j (t, \u03c9, h) \u2208 Th M\n2 j=1\n\n\u03c3 j (t, \u03c9, h) \u2208 Th M,\n\nj = 1, . . . , d,\n\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n\nfor all (t, h) \u2208 R\u22650 \u00d7 M, for P-a.e. \u03c9.\nHence the stochastic invariance problem to (1.1) is equivalent to the deterministic\ninvariance problems (for any \u03c9 apart from a P-nullset) related to the t-dependent\nvector fields {\u03bc, \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 d }.\nNote that Theorem 1 provides conditions for the invariance of a single given\nsubmanifold M. It does not say anything about the existence of finite-dimensional\ninvariant submanifolds for (1.1) or {\u03bc, \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 d }, respectively. This issue will be\nexploited in the present paper.\nWe remark that the existence of finite-dimensional invariant submanifolds is\nessentially equivalent to the existence of finite-dimensional realizations (FDR) for\n(1.1) in the following sense (see [6, Theorem 6.4.1]).\nTheorem 2. Let \u03c3 and M be as in Theorem 1. Suppose M is locally invariant\nfor (1.1). Then, for any space-time initial point (t0 , h0 ) \u2208 R\u22650 \u00d7 M, there exists a\nC 2 -map \u03c6 : Rm \u2192 U \u2229 M, where U is an open neighborhood of h0 in H, and an\nRm -valued diffusion process Z such that\n(t ,h0 )\n\n0\nrt\u2227\u03c4\n\n= \u03c6(Zt\u2227\u03c4 ),\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R\u22650 ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nfor some stopping time \u03c4 > 0.\nFollowing [3] we say that equation (1.1) has a local m-dimensional realization at\n(t0 , h0 ) if (1.4) holds. We say that (1.1) generically admits an FDR at (t0 , h0 ) if\n(1.1) has a local m-dimensional realization for initial points in a neighborhood of\n(t0 , h0 ).\nRemark 1. In view of the preceding remarks we shall suppress the \u03c9-dependence\nfrom now on, making the convention that all subsequent statements (have to) hold\nsimultaneously for all \u03c9 (apart from a P-nullset).\nRemark 2. The forward rate is a mathematical idealization rather than an object\nthat can directly be observed on the market. For statistical inference one usually\nestimates the current forward curve by fitting a parametrized family G of curves\nto the finitely given many market data. Such a family G is generically a finitedimensional immersed submanifold in H. For the sake of consistency of the curvefitting procedure with any given stochastic interest rate model of the form (1.1), it is\nvital that G is invariant for the flow of (1.1). If this is not the case, it is unclear what\nthe parameters of the daily fitting should mean in terms of the model. Consequently,\nthe choice of the volatility structure, \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 d , determines the consistent curvefitting procedures. Volatility structures that do not admit invariant submanifolds\n(i.e. FDRs) should therefore be avoided.\n\n\f4\n\nDAMIR FILIPOVI\u0106 AND JOSEF TEICHMANN\n\nThe FDR-problem consists of finding sufficient conditions on \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 d for the\nexistence of generic FDRs. Bj\u00f6rk et al [1], [3] translated this into an appropriate\ngeometric language. In [3] they completely solved the FDR-problem for a very\nparticular choice of H. Their key argument is the classical Frobenius theorem,\nsince they are looking for foliations (which is the appropriate notion for the FDRproblem on Hilbert spaces). Therefore they define a Hilbert space, H, on which\nA = d/dx is a bounded linear operator. As a consequence H consists solely of\nentire analytic functions (see [3, Proposition 4.2]). It is well known however that\nthe forward rates implied by a Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross (CIR) [4] short rate model are\nof the form rt (x) = g0 (x) + rt (0)g1 (x) where\ng0 (x) = d\n\neax \u2212 1\neax + c\n\nand g1 (x) =\n\nbeax\n,\n(eax + c)2\n\nfor some a, b, c > 0 and d \u2265 0 (see e.g. [6, Section 7.4.1]). Since both g0 and g1 ,\nwhen extended to C, have a singularity at x = (log(c)+i\u03c0)/a, they cannot be entire\nanalytic. Hence the CIR forward rates do not belong to H! This fact seems to be\ninconsistent with some of the results in [3] (see Remark 7.4 therein). Since CIRtype structures appear generically in HJM-framework, the Bj\u00f6rk-Svensson setting\nis too narrow, even though all geometric ideas are already formulated.\nTo overcome this difficulty we have to choose a larger forward curve space. However, we cannot get around the Frobenius theorem, which requires smoothness of the\nvector fields {\u03bc, \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 d }. The problem here is that A is typically an unbounded\noperator (the choice of H in [3] is exactly made to overcome this problem). The\nappropriate framework for an extended version of the Frobenius theorem is given\nby the Fr\u00e9chet space\n\\\nD(A\u221e ) :=\nD(An ),\nn\u2208N\n\nequipped with the family of seminorms\npn (h) =\n\nn\nX\n\nkAm hkH ,\n\nn \u2208 N0 .\n\nm=0\n\nIndeed, D(A\u221e ) is essentially the largest subspace of H which is invariant for A. This\ncalls for a Frobenius theorem in Fr\u00e9chet spaces, which is definitively not straightforward, since the inverse function theorem fails in Fr\u00e9chet spaces in general (see\n[12] for example). Denote by A0 : D(A0 ) \u2192 H0 the restriction of A to H0 . That\nis, D(A0 ) = {h \u2208 D(A) \u2229 H0 | Ah \u2208 H0 }. The definition of the Fr\u00e9chet space\nn\nD(A\u221e\n0 ) = \u2229n\u2208N D(A0 ) is obvious. The next result follows immediately from (H1),\n(H3) and (H4).\nLemma 1. For any f, g \u2208 D(A0 ) we have S(f, g) \u2208 D(A) and\nAS(f, g) = S(Af, g) + S(f, Ag) + f ev0 (g).\nHence S :\n\nD(A\u221e\n0 )\n\n\u221e\n\u00d7 D(A\u221e\n0 ) \u2192 D(A ) is a continuous bilinear mapping.\n\nThe preceding specifications for \u03c3 are still too general for concrete implementations. We actually have the idea of \u03c3 being sensitive with respect to functionals of the forward curve. That is, \u03c3 j (t, h) = \u03c6j (t, l1 (h), . . . , lq (h)), for some\nq \u2208 N, where \u03c6j : R\u22650 \u00d7 Rq \u2192 D(A\u221e\n0 ) is a smooth map and l1 , . . . , lq denote\ncontinuous linear functionals on H (or even on C(R\u22650 ; R)). We may think of\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\n5\n\nRx\nli (h) = (1/xi ) 0 i h(\u03b7) d\u03b7 (benchmark yields) or li (h) = evxi (h) (benchmark forward rates). This idea is (generalized and) expressed in terms of the following\nregularity and non-degeneracy assumptions:\nd\n(A1) \u03c3(t, h) = \u03c6(t, l(h)) with l : H \u2192 B smooth linear and \u03c6 : B \u2192 D(A\u221e\n0 )\nsmooth, so it is a Banach-map (see Definition 3 below).\n(A2) (l, l \u25e6 A) : D(A\u221e ) \u2192 B \u00d7 B is a linear open map.\n(A3) {\u03c61 (t, y), . . . , \u03c6d (t, y)} are linearly independent, for all (t, y) \u2208 R\u22650 \u00d7 B.\n(A4) A is unbounded, that is, D(A) is a strict subset of H.\nWe believe that this setup is flexible enough to capture any reasonable HJM-type\ninterest rate model.

Let A be the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup S on a\nBanach space Y , then the operator A : D(A\u221e ) \u2192 D(A\u221e ) is a Banach-map if and\nonly if A : Y \u2192 Y is bounded.\nProof. Let Y be a Banach space and A the generator of a strongly\nsemigroup S. If A : D(A\u221e ) \u2192 D(A\u221e ) is in a neighborhood of U\na Banach map, then there are smooth mappings R : U \u2282 D(A\u221e )\nQ : V \u2282 X \u2192 D(A\u221e ) such that A = Q \u25e6 R and X is a Banach\ndifferentiation we obtain at x0\n\ncontinuous\na point x0\n\u2192 X and\nspace.

So\nA : D(An ) \u2192 D(An ) is a continuous mapping.

The semigroups S (n) are\ndefined by restriction and are strongly continuous in the respective topologies. The\ngenerator of S (n) is A restricted to D(A(n+1) ). If A were continuous on D(A(n+1) ),\nthen we could climb up the diagram by the resolvent isomorphisms. A continuous\non D(A(n) ) implies that S (n) is a smooth group, so by climbing up through the\n\n\f6\n\nDAMIR FILIPOVI\u0106 AND JOSEF TEICHMANN\n\nisomorphisms S (0) is a smooth group and therefore the infinitesimal generator is\ncontinuous, since it is everywhere defined, by the closed graph theorem.\nWe will demonstrate that the Frobenius integrability condition implies a very\nparticular geometry of the invariant submanifolds \u2013 loosely speaking, each of them is\na band of copies of an affine submanifold. This is similar to Hamiltonian mechanics,\nwhere the existence of several conservation laws forces the flow to be viable not only\non a low dimensional submanifold, but even on a special one, namely a torus.\nRemark 3. Although we focus on the particular stochastic equation (1.1), many\narguments can be carried over to more general stochastic equations in the spirit of\nDa Prato and Zabczyk [5] (see also Remark 1).\n2. Analysis on Fr\u00e9chet Spaces\nA Fr\u00e9chet space E is a completely metrizable locally convex vector space. On a\nFr\u00e9chet space E we are equivalently given a sequence (which can be chosen increasing) of seminorms {pn }n\u22651 generating a complete locally convex topology. For the\nconstruction of a differential calculus we need the concept of differentiable curves\ninto the Fr\u00e9chet space and differentiable mappings on open subsets of a Fr\u00e9chet\nspace. To obtain a completely working differential calculus we should enlarge the\ncategory of vector spaces to so called convenient vector spaces, however, for our\npurposes we can directly give the definitions on Fr\u00e9chet spaces (see [12] for all details). We remark that already on Fr\u00e9chet spaces the situation concerning analysis\nwas complicated and unclear until convenient calculus was invented (see [12] for\nextensive historical remarks).\nWe denote the set of continuous linear functionals by E \u2032 . A subset B of a Fr\u00e9chet\nspace is bounded if and only if l(B) is a bounded subset of R for all l \u2208 E \u2032 . A\nmultilinear mapping m : E1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 En \u2192 F is called bounded if bounded sets B1 \u00d7\n... \u00d7 Bn are mapped to bounded subsets of the Fr\u00e9chet space F . On Fr\u00e9chet spaces\nbounded linear mappings are continuous (see [12] or any textbook on locally convex\nspaces for the proof). In general this is not the case, however continuous linear\nfunctionals are clearly bounded. The set of bounded linear operators on a Fr\u00e9chet\nspace E is denoted by L(E). We prefer the notion \"bounded\" to \"continuous\" in\nthe case of linear operators, since it is better adapted to convenient calculus (the\nfollowing result is true for all convenient spaces).\nDefinition 2. Let E be a Fr\u00e9chet space, then c : R \u2192 E is called smooth if all\nderivatives exist as limits of difference quotients. The set of smooth curves is denoted by C \u221e (R, E). A mapping f : U \u2282 E \u2192 R is called smooth if U is open and\nf \u25e6 c \u2208 C \u221e (R, R) for all c \u2208 C \u221e (R, E).\nTheorem 3. Let E, G, H be Fr\u00e9chet spaces, U \u2282 E, V \u2282 G open subsets, then we\nobtain:\ni) A curve c : R \u2192 E is smooth if and only if it is weakly smooth, i.e. l \u25e6 c \u2208\nC \u221e (R, R) for all l \u2208 E \u2032 .\nii) Multilinear mappings are smooth if and only if they are bounded.\niii) If f : U \u2192 G is smooth, then df : U \u00d7 E \u2192 G is smooth and bounded linear in\nthe second component, where\nd\ndf (x, v) := |t=0 f (x + tv)\ndt\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\n7\n\niv) The chain rule holds.\nv) Taylor's formula is true, where higher derivatives are defined as usual:\nZ 1\nn\nn\nX\n(1 \u2212 t) n+1\n1 i\nd f (x)y (i) +\nd\nf (x + ty) (y (n+1) )dt\nf (x + y) =\ni!\nn!\n0\ni=0\n\nfor all n \u2208 N.\nvi) Given c : R \u2192 L(E), then c : R \u00d7 E \u2192 E is smooth if and only if evv \u25e6 c \u2208\nC \u221e (R, E) for all v \u2208 E, where evv : L(E) \u2192 E denotes the point evaluation.\nvii) A family ai \u2208 L(E) for i \u2208 I of bounded linear operators is uniformly bounded,\ni.e. for all bounded subsets B \u2282 E there is a bounded subset C \u2282 E such that\nfor all i \u2208 I we have ai (B) \u2282 C, if and only if it is pointwise bounded (\"smooth\nuniform boundedness principle\").\nviii) Let B be a Banach space and f : U \u2192 G be a smooth mapping, then f is locally\nLipschitz, i.e. for every point x \u2208 U there is a neighborhood V \u2282 U with\n{\n\nf (x) \u2212 f (y)\n|x 6= y \u2208 V } is bounded in G\nkx \u2212 yk\n\nRemark 4. The introduction of analysis on Fr\u00e9chet spaces via definition 2 is not\nlimited to Fr\u00e9chet spaces, but works on all locally convex spaces (so called convenient\nvector spaces) where weakly smooth curves are smooth. The necessity to work on\nthese spaces instead of working on Fr\u00e9chet spaces arises from the fact that spaces\nlike C \u221e (E, F ) or even L(E) generically are not Fr\u00e9chet space for Fr\u00e9chet spaces\nE, F .\nEven in the case of R2 it is not obvious that the smooth functions of definition 2\nare smooth in the classical sense. Notice that convenient calculus completely solves\nthe problem, how to do analysis on locally convex vector spaces, and provides a very\npowerful tool in concrete calculations (see [12] for many examples).\nNotice that on Fr\u00e9chet spaces the notion of C n -curves is useful, too, and that we\nare also given the chain rule with smooth functions by the uniform boundedness\nprinciple:\nZ 1\nc(t) \u2212 c(0)\nf (c(t)) \u2212 f (c(0))\n=\nDf (c(0) + s(c(t) \u2212 c(0))) *\nds\nt\nt\n0\n\u2212\u2192 Df (c(0)) * c\u2032 (0)\nas t \u2192 0. Furthermore we obtain the following useful result by Taylor's formula\nand uniform boundedness (see [9] for details).\nTheorem 4. Let E, G be Fr\u00e9chet spaces and f : U \u2282 E \u2192 G a smooth mapping.\nGiven x0 \u2208 U and a continuous seminorm q on G, then there is a continuous\nseminorm p on E and \u03b5 > 0 such that\nq(f (x) \u2212 f (y)) \u2264 p(x \u2212 y)\nif p(x \u2212 x0 ) < \u03b5 and p(y \u2212 x0 ) < \u03b5.\nConcerning differential equations, there are possible counterexamples on nonnormable Fr\u00e9chet spaces in all directions, which causes some problems in the foundations of differential geometry (see [12] and the excellent review article [14]). Nevertheless a useful generalization of the existence theorem for differential equations\non Banach spaces is given by the following Banach mapping principle (see [9] for\n\n\f8\n\nDAMIR FILIPOVI\u0106 AND JOSEF TEICHMANN\n\ndetails).

If there is a local flow around x0 \u2208 U (this\nshall mean once and for all: \"in an open neighborhood of x0 \"), then the differential\nequation is uniquely solvable around x0 \u2208 U and the dependence on initial values is\nsmooth. Let U be connected, then a maximal local flow F l associated to P is a local\nflow defined on a connected open set W \u2282 R \u00d7 U such that for any integral curve\nx : I \u2192 U with x(0) = y and I connected we have I \u00d7 {y} \u2208 W and F l(t, y) = x(t)\nfor t \u2208 I.

Parameters and time-dependence are treated in the following way.\nGiven an open subset of parameters Z \u2282 Y of a Banach space and P : I \u00d7 Z \u00d7 U \u2192\nE, where I is a open set in R and U is open in E, such that Pt,p = Qt,p \u25e6 Rt,p ,\nwhere Q and R depend smoothly on time and parameters, P admits a unique smooth\nsolution for any initial value x0 \u2208 U at any time point t0 \u2208 I depending smoothly\non parameters, time and initial values.

In this case F l(t, F l(s, y)) = F l(s + t, y). The\nnotion of a semiflow is redundant on finite-dimensional vector spaces.\nWe are in particular interested in special types of differential equations on\nFr\u00e9chet spaces, namely Banach map perturbated bounded linear equations. Given\na bounded linear operator A : E \u2192 E, the abstract Cauchy problem associated to\nA is given by the differential equation associated to A.

Notice that the theory of\nbounded linear operators on Fr\u00e9chet spaces contains as a special case Hille-YosidaTheory of unbounded operators on Banach spaces (see for example [18]).

In the time dependent case - with respect to the bounded linear map\nand the Banach map - we can argue in the same manner and obtain a unique\ntime-dependent semiflow, smooth with respect to time.\nConcerning smoothness with respect to the initial value, we proceed in the following way: First we show that there exist directional derivatives: By Taylor's\nformula we obtain\nP (x1 ) \u2212 P (x2 ) = L(x1 , x0 ) * (x1 \u2212 x2 )\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\n11\n\nR1\nwhere L(x1 , x2 ) * h := 0 DP (x0 + s(x1 \u2212 x0 )) * hds is a Banach map in all three\nvariables.

The argument follows\nan argument given in [9]. If the dependence were smooth, the derivative with\nrespect to the initial value would satisfy the integral equations\nZ t\nD2 F l(t, x) * v = St v +\nSt\u2212s * DP (F l(s, x)) * D2 F l(t, x) * vds\n0\nZ t\nF l(t, x) = St x +\nSt\u2212s P (F l(s, x))ds\n0\n\nproviding an equation of the same type with Banach mapping\n(x, y) 7\u2192 (P (x), DP (x) * y)\n\nand semigroup St \u2295 St for t \u2265 0.

Thus we can conclude by Theorem 12.8. of [12] and\ninduction. There is one argument hidden, namely, that the domain in t might\nshrink. We overcome this difficulty by the local existence result for the directional\nderivatives, which means that we can construct solutions for the derivative-equation\nby taking original solutions.\nIn an analogue manner we proceed in the time dependent case. Consequently we\nobtain smooth semiflows in all possible cases, which proves the following theorem:\nTheorem 7. Let E be a Fr\u00e9chet space and I an interval, A : I \u00d7 E \u2192 E a smooth\ncurve of bounded linear operators, such that there is a local time dependent semiflow\nEv(t, s, x) for t \u2265 s \u2265 0 in appropriate domains and x \u2208 E satisfying\nd\nEv(t, s, x) = A(t)Ev(t, s, x)\ndt\nEv(t, t, x) = x\nfor t \u2265 s \u2265 0 and x \u2208 E.

Parameter dependence can be easily treated by the above methods on\nthe extended phase space.\n3. Submanifolds and Weak Foliations\nWe are interested in the geometry generated by a finite number of vector fields\ngiven on an open subset of a Fr\u00e9chet space E. Therefore we need the notions of\nfinite-dimensional submanifolds (with boundary) of a Fr\u00e9chet space (see [12] for all\ndetails and more). First we introduce the notion of a smooth Fr\u00e9chet manifold.\nA chart on a set M is a bijective mapping u : U \u2192 u(U ) \u2282 EU , where EU\nis a Fr\u00e9chet space and U \u2282 M , u(U ) \u2282 EU is open. We shall denote a chart\nby (U, u) or (u, u(U )). For two charts (U\u03b1 , u\u03b1 ), (U\u03b2 , u\u03b2 ) the chart changing are\ngiven by u\u03b1\u03b2 := u\u03b1 \u25e6 u\u22121\n: u\u03b2 (U\u03b1\u03b2 ) \u2192 u\u03b1 (U\u03b1\u03b2 ), where U\u03b1\u03b2 := U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 . An\n\u03b2\natlas is a collection of charts such that the U\u03b1 form a cover of M and the chart\nchangings are defined on open subsets of the respective Fr\u00e9chet spaces. A C \u221e atlas is an atlas with smooth chart changings. Two C \u221e -atlases are equivalent is\ntheir union is an C \u221e -atlas. A maximal C \u221e -atlas is called a C \u221e -structure on M\n(maximal is understood with respect to some carefully chosen universe of sets). A\n(smooth) manifold is a set together with a C \u221e -structure. A topological manifold\nis a manifold with a C 0 -structure. If we are given a Banach space, then we can\ndefine C k -manifolds by an C k -structure.\nA smooth mapping f : M \u2192 N between smooth manifolds is defined in the\ncanonical way, i.e. for any x \u2208 M there is a chart (V, v) with f (x) \u2208 V , a chart\n(U, u) of M with x \u2208 U and f (U ) \u2282 V , such that v \u25e6 f \u25e6 u\u22121 is smooth. This is\nthe case if and only if f \u25e6 c is smooth for all smooth curves c : R \u2192 M , where the\nconcept of a smooth curve is easily set upon.\nThe final topology with respect to smooth curves or equivalently the final topology with respect to all inverses of chart mappings is the canonical topology of the\nsmooth manifold. We assume manifolds to be smoothly Hausdorff (see the discussion in [12], p. 265), i.e. the real valued smooth functions on M separate points.\nThe product of smooth manifolds is defined canonically by building up the product\nof the atlases.\nA submanifold N of a Fr\u00e9chet manifold M is given by a subset N \u2282 M , such that\nfor each n \u2208 N there is a chart (u, u(U )), a splitting E = E \u2032 \u00d7E \u2032\u2032 and u(U ) = V \u00d7W\nwith u(N ) = V \u00d7 {u(n)\u2032\u2032 }. By a splitting we shall always understand E \u2032 and E \u2032\u2032\nas closed subspaces of E.\nA finite-dimensional manifold with boundary of dimension n is defined as ordinary manifold except that we take open subsets in a halfspace {x \u2208 Rn with\nxn \u2265 0}. For the notion (without surprises) of smooth mappings on such open sets\nsee any textbook on differential geometry, for example [13]. The boundary {x with\nxn = 0} of the subspace models the boundary \u2202N of the manifold N , which is\ncanonically a manifold without boundary of dimension n \u2212 1. A submanifold with\nboundary is given by the analogue submanifold-structure.\nWe specialize to submanifolds with boundary of Fr\u00e9chet spaces - the case we\nare interested in. Let N \u2282 E be a submanifold with boundary, then the tangent\nd\n|t=0 c(t) of all smooth curves\nspace Tn N at n \u2208 N is given by the derivatives dt\nc : R \u2192 N \u2282 E with c(0) = n. It is a vector space at any point n \u2208 N \\\u2202N and a half\nspace at n \u2208 \u2202N . Nevertheless we denote by Tn N the generated vector space and by\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\n13\n\n(Tn N )+ the canonically given halfspace. There is a natural structure of a manifold\nwith boundary on the disjoint union \u222an\u2208N Tn N , the tangent bundle. A vector field\non N is a smooth mapping on N associating to any point a tangent vector. A\nvector field X on U \u2282 E is therefore simply a smooth mapping X : U \u2192 E, since\nthe tangent space at x \u2208 U is E. The set of vector fields is denoted by X(N ). The\nderivative T f : T M \u2192 T N of a smooth function f : M \u2192 N is defined in the\nfollowing way\nTa f (a, [c]) = (f (a), [f \u25e6 c])\nwhere [c] denotes the equivalence class of curves c : R \u2192 M \u2282 E having the same\nderivative at the t = 0. A local diffeomorphism f : M \u2192 N is an isomorphism on\nthe respective tangent spaces. So the derivative mapping Tx f : Tx U \u2192 Tf (x)V is\ngiven by Tx f (v) = Df (x)v\u0307.\nFinite dimensional submanifolds (with boundary) of a Fr\u00e9chet manifold M can\nlocally be given by immersions. An immersion is a smooth mapping \u03c6 : N \u2192 M\nwith Ta \u03c6 : Ta N \u2192 T\u03c6(a) M injective for all a \u2208 N and N a finite-dimensional\nmanifold of dimension n.\nLemma 4 (Submanifolds by Parametrization). Let N be a finite-dimensional manifold (with boundary), E a Fr\u00e9chet space and \u03c6 : N \u2192 E an immersion, then for\nany n0 \u2208 N there is a small open neighborhood V such that \u03c6(V1 ) is a submanifold\nof E.\nProof. Given an immersion we shall construct a submanifold chart for the local\nimage of N . We assume that N is an open subset of Rm and - by translation\n- \u03c6(n0 ) = 0, since it is a local result. Given a linear basis e1 , ..., en of Tn0 N\nwe get linearly independent vectors Tn0 (\u03c6)(ei ) =: fi \u2208 E. We choose l1 , ..., lm\nlinearly independent linear functionals, such that li (fj ) = \u03b4ij and get a splitting\nE = E \u2032 \u00d7 E \u2032\u2032 with dim E \u2032 = m via E \u2032\u2032 := \u2229m\ni=1 ker li . The projection on the first\nvariable p1 induces a local diffeomorphism p1 \u25e6 \u03c6 on a small open neighborhood\nV of n0 \u2208 N by the classical inverse function theorem. The inverse is denoted by\n\u03c8 : V \u2032 \u2282 E \u2032 \u2192 V . Now we construct a new diffeomorphism\n\u03b7(n, x\u2032\u2032 ) = (p1 \u25e6 \u03c6(n), x\u2032\u2032 + p2 \u25e6 \u03c6(n))\non V \u00d7 W \u2032\u2032 , which is invertible by the above considerations:\n\u03b7 \u22121 (y \u2032 , y \u2032\u2032 ) = (\u03c8(y \u2032 ), y \u2032\u2032 \u2212 p2 \u25e6 \u03c6(\u03c8(y \u2032 ))),\n\u03b7 \u22121 defines a submanifold chart for \u03c6(V ) since\n\u03b7 \u22121 (\u03c6(n)) = (n, 0)\nfor n \u2208 V by definition. The proof for manifolds with boundary works in the\nsame way except that the linear basis at a boundary point n \u2208 \u2202N has to lie in\n(Tn N )+ .\nTwo vector fields X \u2208 X(M ), Y \u2208 X(N ) are called f -related for a smooth\nmap f : M \u2192 N if T f \u25e6 X = Y \u25e6 f . We obtain a bounded linear mapping\nf \u2217 : X(N ) \u2192 X(M ), the pull back, for a local diffeomorphism f : M \u2192 N by the\nfollowing formula\n(f \u2217 Y )(x) = (Tx f )\u22121 (Yf (x) )\nfor Y \u2208 X(N ). The push forward for a diffeomorphism is defined by f\u2217 = (f \u22121 )\u2217 .\n\n\f14\n\nDAMIR FILIPOVI\u0106 AND JOSEF TEICHMANN\n\nEach vector field X admitting a local flow has a maximal local flow F lX producing all integral curves on a connected set, furthermore X is F ltX -related to itself\nfor any t, since\nd X\nd X\nF lt (F lsX (x))|s=0 = F lt+s\n(x)|s=0 = X(F ltX (x))\nds\nds\nGiven a local semiflow, then the solutions of the differential equations are unique:\nGiven an integral curve c we obtain\nTx F ltX (x) * X(x) =\n\nd\nF lt\u2212s (c(s)) = \u2212X(F lt\u2212s (c(s))) + X(F lt\u2212s (c(s))) = 0\nds\nF lt\u2212s (c(s)) = c(t)\nfor all s \u2264 t.\nGiven two vector fields Y \u2208 X(M ) and X \u2208 X(M ) admitting a local flow, where\nM either denotes a finite-dimensional submanifold of a Fr\u00e9chet space or an open\nsubset, we can define the Lie bracket, the most important notion of differential\ngeometry:\nd\nX \u2217\n(F l\u2212t\n) Y |t=0\ndt\nNotice furthermore that for any local diffeomorphism \u03c6\n[X, Y ] =\n\n\u03c6\u2217 [X, Y ] = [\u03c6\u2217 X, \u03c6\u2217 Y ]\nso the pull back is a bounded Lie algebra homomorphism, since vector fields constitute a Lie algebra with the Lie bracket. For details in all possible directions see\n[12].\nFinally we provide a formula for the Lie bracket on a Fr\u00e9chet space. Given two\nvector fields X and Y on an open subset U \u2282 E, where X admits a flow F lX , then\nd\nX \u2217\n(F l\u2212t\n) Y (x)|t=0\ndt\nd\nX\nX\n= DF ltX (F l\u2212t\n(x)) * Y (F l\u2212t\n(x))|t=0\ndt\n= DX(x) * Y (x) \u2212 D2 F l0X (x)(X(x), Y (x)) \u2212 DY (x) * X(x)\n\n[X, Y ](x) =\n\n= DX(x) * Y (x) \u2212 DY (x) * X(x)\nfor x \u2208 U \u2282 E (see [12] and [11]). Due to this formula we can immediately conclude\nsome properties of the submodule of Banach map vector fields:\nLemma 5. Let U be an open set in a Fr\u00e9chet space E, then B(U ) is a subalgebra\nwith respect to the Lie bracket. Let A be a bounded linear operator on E, then\n[A, B(U )] \u2282 B(U ). Consequently the Lie algebra L(E) acts on B(U ) by the Lie\nbracket.\nProof. Given two Banach maps P1 and P2 , DP1 (x)*P2 (x) = DQ1 (R1 (x))*DR1 (x)*\nP2 (x) holds, which can be written as composition of DQ1 (v) * w for v, w \u2208 X and\n(R1 (x), DR1 (x)*P2 (x)) for x \u2208 U . So the Lie bracket lies in B(U ). Given A \u2208 L(E),\nwe see that AP1 (x)\u2212DP1 (x)*Ax is a Banach map by an obvious decomposition.\nDefinition 4. Let E be a Fr\u00e9chet space, U an open subset. A distribution on U\nis a collection of vector subspaces D = {Dx }x\u2208U of {Tx U }x\u2208U . A distribution is\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\n15\n\ncalled smooth if for any x \u2208 U there is an open neighborhood x \u2208 V \u2282 U and n\nvector fields X1 , ..., Xn with\nhX1 (y), ..., Xn (y)i = Dy\nfor y \u2208 V . A distribution D on U is said to be involutive if for any two locally\ngiven vector fields X, Y with values in D the Lie bracket [X, Y ] has values in D. A\ndistribution is said to have constant rank if dimR Dx is locally constant on U .\nWe denote by h. . . i the generated vector space over the reals R. In the case of a\nsmooth distribution D we sometimes apply the notation D = hX1 , . . . , Xn i which\nmeans that Dx is vector space generated by X1 (x), . . . , Xn (x). We call this the\nlinear span of X1 , . . . , Xn . If the vector fields X1 , . . . , Xn are linearly independent\nin a open neighborhood of a point and if they span D, then we call these vector\nfields a local basis.\nRemark 7. Given a smooth distribution D on U such that the dimensions of Dx\nare bounded by a fixed constant N . Let x \u2208 U be a point with maximal dimension\nnx = dimR Dx , then there are n smooth vector fields X1 , ..., Xn and an open subset\nx \u2208 V \u2282 U such that\nhX1 (y), ..., Xn (y)i = Dy\nfor y \u2208 V . At x there are nx linearly independent vectors, say X1 (x), ..., Xnx (x).\nChoosing nx continuous linear functionals l1 , ..., lnx \u2208 E \u2032 with li (Xj (x)) = \u03b4ij ,\nthen the continuous mapping l : U \u2192 L(Rnx ), x 7\u2192 (li (Xj (x))) has range in the\ninvertible matrices in a small neighborhood of x. Consequently in this neighborhood\nthe dimension of Dy is at least nx . It follows by maximality of nx that it is constant.\nIn particular a smooth distribution with constant rank admits locally a basis.\nThe concept of weak foliations will be perfectly adapted to our purposes in HJMtheory:\nDefinition 5. Given a distribution D on an open subset U \u2282 E, a tangential\nmanifold (with boundary) for D is an immersion \u03c6N : N \u2192 U such that Dn \u2282\nTn \u03c6N (Tn N ) for all n \u2208 N . We say that D admits a weak foliation of rank m if for\nany point x0 \u2208 U there is an open subset V of {u \u2208 Rm with um \u2265 0}, an open\nsubset W \u2032\u2032 of a Fr\u00e9chet space E \u2032\u2032 and a smooth mapping \u03c8 : V \u00d7 W \u2032\u2032 \u2192 U such\nthat\ni) There is a point in the parameter space such that x0 = \u03c8(u0 , x\u2032\u20320 );\nii) T(u0 ,x\u2032\u2032 ) \u03c8 : Rm \u00d7 E \u2032\u2032 \u2192 E is an isomorphism;\niii) \u03c8(., x\u2032\u2032 ) is an tangential manifold (with boundary) for D for any x\u2032\u2032 \u2208 W \u2032\u2032 ;\niv) The tangent distribution given by all tangent spaces of the tangential manifolds\nhas constant rank m.\nRemark 8. The immersed manifolds are called leafs. In the chart sometimes the\nnotion plaque is applied for their local image. The dimension m of the tangential manifolds will generically be greater than the dimension of Dx of the given\ndistribution D.\nClassically one is interested in the existence of weak foliations for a given distribution of minimal dimension m. Therefore we shall need the following essential\nlemma:\n\n\f16\n\nDAMIR FILIPOVI\u0106 AND JOSEF TEICHMANN\n\nLemma 6. Let D be an involutive, smooth distribution of constant rank n on an\nopen subset U of a Fr\u00e9chet space E. Let X and Y be vector fields with values in D\nand let X admit a local flow, then\n(F ltX )\u2217 (Y )(x) \u2208 Dx\nfor x \u2208 U , where it is defined.\nProof. Given\nP a local basis X1 , ..., Xn around x0 , we have by involutivity that\n[X, Xi ] = nk=1 fik Xk . Remark that fik are smooth functions locally around x0 :\nGiven n linear independent functionals lm such that lm (Xj (x0 )) = \u03b4mj , then\nlm ([X, Xi ](x)) =\n\nn\nX\n\nfik lm (Xk (x))\n\nk=1\n\nSince the matrix M (x) := (lm (Xk (x))) is invertible at x0 and has smooth entries,\nit is invertible on an open neighborhood of x0 , and the inverse has smooth entries.\nThe smooth inverse matrix applied to the left hand vector proves the smoothness\nof fik . By involutivity we obtain\nd\nd\nX\n(F ltX )\u2217 (Xi ) = \u2212 (F lt\u2212s\n)\u2217 (Xi )|s=0 =\ndt\nds\nd\nX \u2217\n) (F ltX )\u2217 (Xi )|s=0 =\n= \u2212 (F l\u2212s\nds\n= \u2212[X, (F ltX )\u2217 (Xi )] =\n= \u2212(F ltX )\u2217 [X, Xi ] =\n=\u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nfik \u25e6 F ltX (F ltX )\u2217 (Xk )\n\nk=1\n\nwhich is a linear equation with time-dependent coefficients gik (t) := \u2212fik (F ltX (x))\nfor (F ltX )\u2217 (Xi )(x) at any point x in that neighborhood of x0 . Consequently provided the initial values lie in Dx the solution lies in Dx , but (F l0X )\u2217 (Xi )(x) =\nXi (x).\nNow we can state and prove the Frobenius theorem for weak foliations, remark\nthat in this infinite-dimensional case the Frobenius condition is a sufficient condition\nfor the existence of a weak foliation, since there are problems to solve ordinary\ndifferential equations. Nevertheless we shall see that there is a partial answer in\nthe other direction.\nTheorem 8. Let D be an involutive, smooth distribution of constant rank n on an\nopen subset U of a Fr\u00e9chet space E and assume that for any point x0 there is a\nbasis of the distribution X1 , ..., Xn of locally defined vector fields, where X1 , ..., Xn\u22121\nadmit local flows F ltXi and Xn admits a local semiflow, then D admits a weak\nfoliation of rank n.\nProof. There are locally on some open set n linearly independent vector fields\nX1 , ..., Xn generating each Dx with local flows F lXi for i = 1, ..., n \u2212 1 and a local\nsemiflow F lXn . Without restriction we set x0 = 0. We choose n linear functionals\n\u2032\u2032\nl1 , ..., ln such that li (Xj (0)) = \u03b4ij , so we get some splitting r : E \u2192 Rn \u00d7 E . We\ndefine the parametrization \u03b1(u, y) = F luX11 \u25e6 ... \u25e6 F luXnn (0, y) for (u, y) in an open\n\u2032\u2032\nsubset around 0 in Rn \u00d7 E . We can calculate by looking at the partial derivatives\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\nthe tangent map applied to the canonical standard basis\n(Tu Rn )+ , the\nTu \u03b1(\n\n\u2202\n\u2202ui |u\n\n17\n\n:= [s 7\u2192 u + sei ] of\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nn\u22121\n)\u2217 Xn )(\u03b1(u, y))\n|u , ...,\n|u )(X1 , ..., (F luX11 )\u2217 ...(F luXn\u22121\n\u2202u1\n\u2202un\n\nwhich lie by Lemma 6 in D\u03b1(u,y) and generate it in a small neighborhood by a\ndimension argument. It is essential that the first n \u2212 1 vector fields admit a local\nflow. So we obtain a family of tangential manifolds for D. Each parametrization for\nfixed y defines locally a smooth submanifold with boundary \u03b1(u1 , .., un\u22121 , 0, y).\nRemark 9. For details on Frobenius theorems in the classical setting see [11]. The\nphenomenon that there is no Frobenius chart is due to the fact that there is one vector field among the vector fields X1 ,...,Xn (generating the distribution D) admitting\nonly a local semiflow. If all of them admitted flows, there would exist a Frobenius\nchart, which can be given by a construction outlined in [19]. The non-existence\nof a Frobenius-chart means that the leafs cannot be parallelized, since they follow\nsemiflows, which means that \"gaps\" between two leafs can appear. These \"gaps\" do\nnot appear as interior point of a leaf. This is an infinite dimensional phenomenon,\nwhich does not appear in finite dimensions.\nRemark 10. Let D be a smooth distribution of constant rank n on an open subset\nU of a Fr\u00e9chet space E and assume that for any point x0 there is a basis of the\ndistribution X1 , ..., Xn of locally defined vector fields, where X1 , ..., Xn\u22121 admit local\nflows F ltXi and Xn admits a local semiflow. Assume furthermore that D admits a\nweak foliation of dimension n, then the distribution is involutive. This is easily seen\nby applying (F ltXi )\u2217 to Xj at x \u2208 U , which is by assumption an element of Dx (since\nthe flow restricts by uniqueness of integral curves to the tangential manifolds), so\ndifferentiation and smoothness yield the result by the formula of lemma 6.\n4. Existence of Finite dimensional Realizations\nSubsequently, we let assumptions (A1)\u2013(A4) be in force. For simplicity we shall\ndiscuss only the time-homogeneous case (see Remark 14 for an outline of the timeinhomogeneous case).\nThe vector fields {\u03bc, \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 d } induce two smooth distributions on D(A\u221e ):\ntheir linear span D, and DLA , the linear span of all multiple Lie brackets of these\nvector fields.\nRecapturing the discussion in Section 1 we now can say that (1.1) has generically\nan FDR if D admits locally a weak foliation. We shall see below (Proposition 2) that\nthe assumption that D admits a weak foliation on some open set V is equivalent to\nthe assumption that DLA is an involutive, smooth distribution with constant rank\non some open (in general smaller) subset U \u2282 V .\nPd\nDefine the smooth map \u0393 := j=1 \u0393j : B \u2192 D(A\u221e ) by\n\u0001\n1\n\u0393j (y) := S(\u03c6j (y)) \u2212 D\u03c6j (y) l(\u03c6j (y)) .\n2\n\nSo that we can write \u03bc(h) = Ah + \u0393(l(h)).\nLet U denote an open set in D(A\u221e ) in what follows.\n\n\f18\n\nDAMIR FILIPOVI\u0106 AND JOSEF TEICHMANN\n\nLemma 7.

We have dim DLA = d on O. Nevertheless, O is a (d + 1)-dimensional (affine) submanifold2 of D(A\u221e ). Hence, although\nDLA does not have full rank, d + 1, globally on D(A\u221e ) we obtain a global generic\n(d + 1)-dimensional realization. That is, a global weak foliation of D(A\u221e ) with\nleafs given by (4.7) and O, respectively. The global HJM-model is by construction\nGaussian.\nRemark 12. The ODEs (4.9) and (4.12), respectively, have already been derived\nand discussed in [3]. They are further analyzed in [2], where also the dynamics of\nthe coordinate process is derived.\n\nRemark 13. We can interpret the coordinates of the invariant submanifolds economically. If we turn back to the construction of the charts as given in Theorem 8 we see that we have been choosing continuous linear functionals l1 , . . . , ln .\nThey can be chosen as linear combinations of point evaluations (we assumed them\nto be continuous) evx1 , . . . , evxn by Theorem 23.10 in [12], which tells that lin\u2032\near combinations of point evaluations are dense in C \u221e (R\u22650 , R) . For the proof\nlook at the bounded multilinear mapping (evx1 , . . . , evxn ) 7\u2192 det(evxi (Xj (y))) which\ncannot be identically zero, since then the extension of the multilinear mapping to\n(l1 , . . . , ln ) 7\u2192 det(li (Xj (y))) would be identically zero, too. However, this is impossible due to linear independence of Xj (y). Consequently we can interpret the\nfinite dimensional realization as Markovian process in \"benchmarks\". Notice that\neven though \"benchmark\" are obtained by linear projections on the forward rate,\nthe Markovian process of the finite dimensional realization is in general not the\nprojection of the solution of the HJM-equation.\n2 We assume here that \u2206 , \u2206 \u2206 \u2208 D(A\u221e ). This requires a nice choice of \u03b3 ki in (4.12). That\ni\ni j\nis, the matrix (\u03b3 ij ) must have negative eigenvalues.\n\n\fFINITE DIMENSIONAL REALIZATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS\n\n23\n\nThe necessity of the assumptions in Proposition 1 for the existence of generic\nFDRs is essentially given by\nProposition 2. Suppose that D is a smooth distribution of constant rank d + 1\non an open subset U . Assume furthermore that on U the distribution D admits\na weak foliation of dimension m (by Definition 5 necessarily m \u2265 d + 1). Then\ndimR (DLA )x \u2264 m and there are points x0 \u2208 U such that DLA is a smooth involutive\ndistribution of constant rank in a neighborhood of x0 .\nProof. We repeat the argument of Remark 10. Take two vector fields of the canonical basis {\u03bc, \u03c3 1 , . . . , \u03c3 d } of D . They admit a local (semi)flow, which restricts\nnecessarily to the leafs of the weak foliation by assumption, so the formula of\nLemma 6 tells that their Lie bracket lies in the tangent distribution of the weak\nfoliation. By the special choice of the vector fields we know from section 2 that\nthe Lie brackets admit local flows as Banach maps, so by uniqueness of the integral\ncurve the flow restricts to the leafs. We can prove now by induction that DLA\nis an subdistribution of the tangent distribution of the weak foliation. Since the\ndimensions are globally bounded by m, it is a smooth distribution and therefore\ninvolutive around some points where the rank is maximal.\nThe general case where DLA has locally constant rank kD is sketched in the following proposition, which provides the full classification of FDRs in our framework.\nThe detailed analysis and the geometric implications will be discussed elsewhere.\nProposition 3. Suppose that DLA has locally constant dimension kD and that the\nmappings\n(l, l \u25e6 A, ..., l \u25e6 Ar ) : D(A\u221e ) \u2192 B r+1\nare open for all integers r \u2265 0.

See also [3].\n\nRemark 15. We can replace D(A\u221e ) in the above discussion by any Fr\u00e9chet space\nE that satisfies (H1)-(H3) (where H is to be replaced by E). The Banach-map\n\u03c3 : E \u2192 E0 has to be chosen according to (A1)-(A3). We assume that S(t) is a\nsmooth semigroup on E and (A4) has to be replaced by\n(A4') A : E \u2192 E is not a Banach map\n(see Lemma 3). We may think of E = C \u221e (R\u22650 ; R). Then all the above conclusions\non the geometry of generic FDRs (=weak foliations) can be drawn. This illustrates\nthat our analysis is essentially independent of the initial choice of H.
