Introduction\nAnalytic calculation of the time evolution in two-level systems has been studied\nby a number of authors for a long time since the beginning years of quantum\nmechanics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. These results have been applied to\nvarious areas of physics including quantum optics, laser spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic\nresonance and atomic collisions [15, 16, 17, 18]. The importance of the study of quantum\ntime-evolution is still increasing even now; For example, much attention has been\npaid recently to the quantum manipulation of qubits [19] and magnetization process\nof magnetic molecules with large spin [20]. Recent rapid development of computers has\nenabled massive numerical simulation of quantum dynamics. Nevertheless, it remains\nto be important to study analytically solvable models for the following reasons: (1) in\nsome ranges of physical parameters the numerical simulation becomes too difficult, and\n(2) analytic solutions give a clearer description about parameter dependence.\nAnalytic solutions of quantum dynamics can be classified into several classes. Some\nof them are obtained by using hypergeometric functions. This was first found by Rosen\nand Zener [3], which has then been generalized by several authors [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\nIn these studies, the time-variable t is generally transformed into another real variable\n\n\fAnalytic calculation of nonadiabatic transition probabilities\n\n2\n\nz = z(t), which varies from 0 to 1 monotonically. Then, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of\ntwo-level systems can be reduced to the hypergeometric differential equation, and the\ntransition probability can be related to the connection problem between two pairs of\nfundamental solutions around z = 0 and z = 1.\nOne exception is the approach by Carroll and Hioe [13]. They have studied two\nsolvable classes, and in one of them they have introduced a new variable z(t) changing\nfrom \u2212\u221e to \u221e as t increases and have reduced the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to the RiemannPapperitz equation. Recently, Ishkhanyan has pointed out that the Carroll-Hioe model\ncan be understood in terms of the hypergeometric functions by considering a complexvalued path z(t) = (y(t) + i)/2i where y(t) is a real variable [14]. By this complex-valued\npath, Ishkhanyan also found a new solvable class, but he did not obtain results for the\ntransition probability.\nIn this paper, we show that for the complex-valued path, the transition probability\ncan be calculated efficiently from the 'monodromy' matrices of the corresponding\ndifferential equations. Monodromy is one of the global properties of differential\nequations, and has attracted much attention by mathematicians, for example, through\nthe deep connection with the Painlev\u00e9 equations [21]. Hence, we expect that the\nmonodromy approach is valuable not only because it enables one to calculate the\ntransition probability for various models but also because it establishes a connection\nbetween physical phenomena and global features of differential equations.\nIn this paper, as a concrete example, we mainly consider the following timedependent two-level Schr\u00f6dinger equation and obtain the transition probability using\nthe monodromy associated with the solution:\ni\n\na1t\na2t\n\n!\n\n=\n\n\u03b5(t) V (t)\nV (t) \u2212\u03b5(t)\n\n!\n\na1\na2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b5(t) = E0 sech(t/T ) + E1 tanh(t/T ),\n\n(2)\n\nV (t) = V0 .\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the matrix elements are given by\n\nHere, the coefficients, E0 , E1 and V0 , are assumed to be real constants. This is one of\nthe solvable class reported by Ishkhanyan [14]. However, the transition probability for\nthe model has not been obtained. It should be noted that this model is equivalent to\nthe Rosen-Zener model [3] in the case E1 = 0 \u2021, and that it also includes the special\ncase of the second Demkov-Kunike model [7] in the case E0 = 0. Hence, this model can\ngive a smooth connection between the two known results.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. We give the relation between the transition\nprobability and the monodromy of the hypergeometric function in \u00a7 2, and the transition\nprobability is calculated explicitly in \u00a7 3. The extension to the multi-level problems is\n\u2021 In the original Rosen-Zener model, \u03b5(t) is a constant, while V (t) has a sech-type pulse form. This\nHamiltonian, however, is reformed by a proper unitary transformation of the wave function to coincide\nwith the present model.\n\n\fAnalytic calculation of nonadiabatic transition probabilities\n\n3\n\naddressed in \u00a7 4. Finally, the results are summarized in \u00a7 5. In Appendix A, we describe\nthe generalization of the present model and its relationship to the Carroll-Hioe's model.\n2. Hypergeometric function and monodromy\nThe diagonal elements in the model (1) are eliminated by the following change of\nvariables:\nt\n\n\u0012 Z\n\nc1 = a1 exp i\n\n0\n\n\u0012\n\nc2 = a2 exp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b5dt ,\nt\n0\n\n(4)\n\n\u0013\n\n(5)\n\n\u0013\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b5dt .\n\nThen, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is expressed as\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\nic1t = V exp 2i\n\nt\n\n\u03b5dt c2 ,\n\n0\n\n\u0012\n\nt\n\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\nz(1 \u2212 z)c1zz + (\u03b3 \u2212 (1 + \u03b1 + \u03b2)z)c1z \u2212 \u03b1\u03b2c1 = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nic2t = V exp \u22122i\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b5dt c1 .\n\nBy combining these two equations, we obtain the second-order differential equations for\nc1 and c2 respectively as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nVt\nc1t + V 2 c1 = 0,\n(8)\nc1tt + \u22122i\u03b5(t) \u2212\nV\n\u0013\n\u0012\nVt\nc2t + V 2 c2 = 0.\n(9)\nc2tt + 2i\u03b5(t) \u2212\nV\nIt should be noted that the equation for c2 is obtained by replacing \u03b5(t) by \u2212\u03b5(t) in (8).\nHence, once the solution of the equation for c1 is obtained, the solution for c2 is easily\nobtained by reversing the sign of the parameters in \u03b5(t).\nThe above discussion is general. Now, we consider the specific model given by (2)\nand (3). By substituting these specific forms of \u03b5(t) and V (t) into (8) and adopting the\nchange of variable as\nsinh(t/T ) + i\nz(t) =\n,\n(10)\n2i\nequation (8) can be reduced to the differential equation of the hypergeometric\nfunction [22],\n\nHere, the parameters, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, are determined as\n\u03b1 = iT (\u2212E1 +\n\nq\n\nE12 + V02 ),\n\n(12)\n\nq\n\n(13)\n\u03b2 = iT (\u2212E1 \u2212 E12 + V02 ),\n1\n\u03b3 = + E0 T \u2212 iE1 T.\n(14)\n2\nIn the same way, equation (9) is reduced to the hypergeometric differential equation\nwith the parameters\n\u03b1\u2032 = iT (E1 +\n\nq\n\nE12 + V02 ),\n\n(15)\n\n\f4\n\nAnalytic calculation of nonadiabatic transition probabilities\nq\n\n(16)\n\u03b2 \u2032 = iT (E1 \u2212 E12 + V02 ),\n1\n\u03b3 \u2032 = \u2212 E0 T + iE1 T.\n(17)\n2\nAs already mentioned, these parameters are obtained by replacing E0 and E1 by \u2212E0\nand \u2212E1 respectively in (12)-(14). In the following calculation, related to the calculation\nfor c2 , the prime indicates that it is obtained by reversing the sign of E0 and E1 from\nthe original quantity without the prime.\nFrom (10), it can be easily seen that the variable |z| \u2192 \u221e as |t| \u2192 \u221e. Hence, for\ndiscussion about the initial state it is convenient to consider the fundamental solutions\naround z = \u221e as\nc1 = A1 f\u221e (z; \u03b1) + A2 f\u221e (z; \u03b2),\n\n(18)\n\n\u2032\n\n(19)\n\n\u2032\n\nc2 = B1 f\u221e (z; \u03b1 ) + B2 f\u221e (z; \u03b2 ),\n\nwhere f\u221e (z; \u03b1) and f\u221e (z; \u03b2) are expressed in terms of the hypergeometric functions as\nf\u221e (z; \u03b1) = z \u2212\u03b1 F (\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 + 1, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 + 1; 1/z),\n\nf\u221e (z; \u03b2) = z\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\n(20)\n\nF (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 + 1, \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1 + 1; 1/z),\n\n(21)\n\nwith similar definitions for f\u221e (z; \u03b1\u2032 ) and f\u221e (z, \u03b2 \u2032 ). Since \u03b1 and \u03b2 are pure-imaginary\nin the present model, we have to choose arg(z) to determine the branch.

To be more accurate, around\nz = i\u221e + 1/2 (corresponding to t \u2192 \u2212\u221e) denoted by the point P in Fig. 1 (a), the\nsolution is given by\nc1 (z) = A1 f\u221e (z; \u03b1),\n\u2032\n\nc2 (z) = B1 f\u221e (z; \u03b1 ).\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nOn the other hand, the final state is given by the solution of the hypergeometric\ndifferential equation around z = \u2212i\u221e + 1/2 (corresponding to t \u2192 \u221e) denoted by\nthe point Q in Fig. 1 (a). The path z(t) in the complex plane is also drawn in Fig. 1.\nThen, the solution around the point Q analytically continued from the point P does\nnot equal to (34) and (35); The solution is expressed as linear combinations of the\nfundamental solutions around z = \u221e. This is crucial to the calculation of the transition\nprobability.\nIn order to make the situation clearer, let us deform the path of z as shown in\nFig. 1 (b). In this deformed path, the analytic continuation of the solution is divided\ninto two parts, C1 and C2 . Here, the path C1 denotes a round trip to the singular point\nat z = 1, while the path C2 is a half round trip around z = \u221e in the clockwise direction.\nThe analytic continuation along the path C2 is easily performed, and determined only by\nthe fundamental solutions around z = \u221e. On the other hand, the analytic continuation\nalong the path C1 is nontrivial, and determined by the global character of the differential\nequation called the 'monodromy'.

Application of monodromy to multi-level problems\nThe application of the monodromy matrix to the transition probability is not restricted\nto the hypergeometric functions. The monodromy approach is also applicable to the\ndifferential equations whose monodromy is known. To show such an example, we\nconsider the multi-level problem.

It should be noted that in the limit E1 T \u2192\n\u221e, this model is reduced to the extended Landau-Zener model studied by several\nauthors [23, 24, 25, 26].

This\nequation has been studied by Okubo in detail [27], and it is known that this form of\nequation is convenient to study the monodromy.\nThus, it has been shown that at least one specific model of multi-level systems can\nbe reduced to the differential equation whose monodromy is known. Actual calculation\nof the transition probability needs explicit treatment of the monodromy matrices,\nand remains as a future problem. The present discussion for multi-level systems is\npreliminary, and more detailed study will be needed to clarify the efficiency of the\nmonodromy approach.\n5. Summary\nWe have calculated the transition probability for the Hamiltonian including the tanhtype plus sech-type energy difference with constant off-diagonal elements. The obtained\nresult gives the natural connection between the known results, the Rosen-Zener model\nand the second Demkov-Kunike model. This model also includes the Landau-Zener\nformula in the limit of the large amplitude of the tanh-type energy difference.\nIn our calculation, the monodromy of the hypergeometric functions is essential. We\nhave shown that the monodromy approach is also applicable to the multi-level problems.\nWe expect that the use of the monodromy in the calculation of the transition probability\ndoes not only helps finding more solvable models but also connects global properties of\nthe differential equation with the physical phenomena. Details of calculation especially\nfor the multi-level problem remain as future problems.\n\n\fAnalytic calculation of nonadiabatic transition probabilities\n\n12\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank H.

Solvable classes\nThe model considered in the main part of this paper belongs to one solvable class called\nclass 1 below. It can be given as\nE0 T + E1 T y dy\n,\n(A.1)\n\u03b5(t) =\n1 + y2\ndt\nV0 T dy\n,\n(A.2)\nV (t) = \u221a\n1 + y 2 dt\nwhere y(t) is an 'arbitrary' monotonically increasing function satisfying y(t) \u2192 \u00b1\u221e for\nt \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. When we adopt y(t) = sinh(t/T ), we obtain (2) and (3). For this class, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation can be reduced to the same hypergeometric differential equation\n(11) through the change of variable z(t) = (y(t) + i)/2i [14]. Hence, all models of\nthis class give the same transition probability (64). In this class, however, we have to\ndefine the transition probability carefully. In the limit t \u2192 \u2212\u221e (y \u2192 \u2212\u221e), the matrix\nelements become\nE1 T dy\n,\n(A.3)\n\u03b5(t) \u2192\ny dt\nV0 T dy\nV (t) \u2192 \u2212\n.\n(A.4)\ny dt\nHence, the wave function of the ground state in this limit has mixed components as\ntreated in \u00a7 2. The initial state is taken as the ground state in this limiting Hamiltonian,\nand the transition probability is defined as square of modulus of the final amplitude of\nthe excited states.\nThe application of the monodromy is not restricted to the class 1. As discussed\nby Ishkhanyan [14], as long as the complex path z(t) = (y(t) + i)/2i is used, the\ncalculation by the monodromy is efficient. For example, the following solvable class\ncan be considered:\nE0 T + E1 T y dy\n,\n(A.5)\n\u03b5(t) =\n1 + y2\ndt\nV0 T dy\n.\n(A.6)\nV (t) =\n1 + y 2 dt\nThis class, called here the class 2, has been first studied by Carroll and Hioe [13].\nThere, the transition probability has been calculated by solving the Riemann-Papperitz\n\n\fAnalytic calculation of nonadiabatic transition probabilities\n\n13\n\nequation without resorting to the monodromy. By following the Ishkhanyan's discussion,\nhowever, our monodromy approach is also efficient for the class 2, and gives an\nalternative method.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n\nLandau L D 1932 Phys.
