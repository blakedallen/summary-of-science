Emre Tuna\nMiddle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey\n\nNovember 2, 2018\nAbstract\nSynchronization of coupled harmonic oscillators is investigated. Coupling considered here is pairwise, unidirectional, and described by a nonlinear function (whose graph resides in the first and third quadrants) of\nsome projection of the relative distance (between the states of the pair\nbeing coupled) vector. Under the assumption that the interconnection\ntopology defines a connected graph, it is shown that the synchronization\nmanifold is semiglobally practically asymptotically stable in the frequency\nof oscillations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSynchronization in coupled dynamical systems, due to the broad range of applications, has been a common ground of investigation for researchers from different\ndisciplines. Most of the work in the area studies the case where the interconnection between individual systems is linear; see, for instance, [17, 9, 11, 16, 4, 7].\nNonlinear coupling is also of interest since certain phenomena cannot be meaningfully modelled by linear coupling. A particular system exemplifying nonlinear coupling that attracted much attention is Kuramoto model and its like\n[5, 10]. Among more general results allowing nonlinear coupling are [2, 13] where\npassivity theory is employed to obtain sufficient conditions for synchronization\nunder certain symmetry or balancedness assumptions on the graph describing\nthe interconnection topology.\nIn this paper we consider the basic equation of the theory of oscillations\nq\u0308 = \u2212\u03c9 2 q\ni.e., the harmonic oscillator. One physical example is a unit mass attached to a\nspring. We interest ourselves with the following question. If we take a number of\nidentical mass-spring systems and couple some pairs by unidirectional nonlinear\ndampers, will they eventually oscillate synchronously? To be precise, do the\n\n1\n\n\fsolutions of the following array of coupled harmonic oscillators\nX\nq\u0308i = \u2212\u03c9 2 qi +\n\u03b3ij (q\u0307j \u2212 q\u0307i ) , i = 1, 2, . . . , p\nj6=i\n\n(where \u03b3ij (*) is either identically zero or it is some function whose graph lies\nentirely in the first and third quadrants) synchronize? This question may be of\ndirect importance for certain simple mechanical systems or electrical circuits,\nbut our main interest in it is due to the possibility that it may serve as a lucky\nstarting point for understanding a more general scenario.\nRegarding the above question, our finding in the paper is roughly that synchronization occurs among mass-spring systems if the springs are stiff enough\nand there is at least one system that directly or indirectly effects all others. More\nformally, what we show is that, for a given set of functions {\u03b3ij (*)} describing the\ncoupling configuration, if the graph representing the interconnection topology\nis connected, then the solutions can be made to converge to an arbitrarily small\nneighborhood of the synchronization manifold, starting from initial conditions\narbitrarily far from it by choosing large enough \u03c9. In technical terms, what\nwe establish is the semiglobal practical asymptotic stability (in \u03c9) of the synchronization manifold. Intuition and simulations tell us that global asymptotic\nsynchronization should occur regardless of what \u03c9 is. This however we have not\nbeen able to prove (nor disprove).\nWe reach our final result in three steps. Note that the solution of an uncoupled harmonic oscillator defines a rotating vector on the plane. Thanks to\nlinearity of the system the speed of this rotation (\u03c9) is independent of the initial conditions. As a first step therefore we express the systems with respect to\na rotating coordinate system. This change of variables yields coupled systems\nwhose righthand sides are periodic in time (with period 2\u03c0/\u03c9). Our second step\nis to exploit this periodicity. We obtain the average systems and realize that\nthey belong to a well-studied class of systems pertaining to consensus problems\n[6]. We then deduce that the solutions of average systems converge to a fixed\npoint on the plane. As our final step we use the result of [14] to conclude that\nthe global asymptotic synchronization of average systems implies the semiglobal\npractical asymptotic synchronization of coupled harmonic oscillators.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nLet N denote the set of nonnegative integers and R\u22650 the set of nonnegative\nreal numbers. Let |*| denote Euclidean norm. For x = [xT1 xT2 . . . xTp ]T with\nxi \u2208 Rn we let A := {x \u2208 Rnp : xi = xj for all i, j} be synchronization\nmanifold. A function \u03b1 : R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 is said to belong to class-K (\u03b1 \u2208 K) if it\nis continuous, zero at zero, and strictly increasing. A function \u03b2 : R\u22650 \u00d7 R\u22650 \u2192\nR\u22650 is said to belong to class-KL if, for each t \u2265 0, \u03b2(*, t) is nondecreasing\nand lims\u21920+ \u03b2(s, t) = 0, and, for each s \u2265 0, \u03b2(s, *) is nonincreasing and\nlimt\u2192\u221e \u03b2(s, t) = 0. Given a closed set S \u2282 Rn and a point x \u2208 Rn , |x|S\ndenotes the (Euclidean) distance from x to S.\n2\n\n\fA (directed) graph is a pair (N , E) where N is a nonempty finite set (of nodes)\nand E is a finite collection of ordered pairs (edges) (ni , nj ) with ni , nj \u2208 N . A\ndirected path from n1 to nl is a sequence of nodes (n1 , n2 , . . . , nl ) such that\n(ni , ni+1 ) is an edge for i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , l \u2212 1}. A graph is connected if it has a\nnode to which there exists a directed path from every other node.1\nA set of functions {\u03b3ij : R \u2192 R}, where i, j = 1, 2, . . . , p with i 6= j,\ndescribes (is) an interconnection if the following hold for all i, j and all s \u2208 R:\n(i) \u03b3ij (0) = 0 and s\u03b3ij (s) \u2265 0.\n(ii) Either \u03b3ij (s) \u2261 0 or there exists \u03b1 \u2208 K such that |\u03b3ij (s)| \u2265 \u03b1(|s|).\nTo mean \u03b3ij (s) \u2261 0 we write \u03b3ij = 0. Otherwise we write \u03b3ij 6= 0. The graph\nof interconnection {\u03b3ij } is pair (N , E), where N = {n1 , . . . , np } and E is such\nthat (ni , nj ) \u2208 E iff \u03b3ij 6= 0. An interconnection is said to be connected when\nits graph is connected.\nTo give an example, consider a set of functions C := {\u03b3ij : i, j = 1, . . . , 4}.\nLet \u03b313 , \u03b323 , \u03b324 , \u03b332 be as in Fig. 1 while the remaining functions be zero.\nNote that each \u03b3ij satisfies conditions (i) and (ii). Therefore set C describes an\ninterconnection. To determine whether C is connected or not we examine its\ngraph, see Fig. 2. Since there exists a path to node n4 from every other node,\nwe deduce that the graph (hence interconnection C) is connected.\n\n3\n\nProblem statement\n\nWe consider the following array of coupled harmonic oscillators\nq\u0307i\n\u1e57i\n\n=\n=\n\n\u03c9pi\n\u2212\u03c9qi +\n\n(1a)\nX\n\n\u03b3ij (pj \u2212 pi ) ,\n\ni = 1, 2, . . . , p\n\n(1b)\n\nj6=i\n\nwhere \u03c9 > 0 and {\u03b3ij } is a connected interconnection. We assume throughout\nthe paper that \u03b3ij are locally Lipschitz. Let \u03bei \u2208 R2 denote the state of ith oscillator, i.e., \u03bei = [qi pi ]T . When coupling functions \u03b3ij are linear, the oscillators\nare known to (exponentially) synchronize for all \u03c9. That is, solutions \u03bei (*) converge to a common (bounded) trajectory, see [12]. In this paper we investigate\nthe behaviour of oscillators under nonlinear coupling. In particular, we aim to\nunderstand the effect of the frequency of oscillations \u03c9 on synchronization for a\ngiven interconnection {\u03b3ij }.\n\n4\n\nChange of coordinates\n\nWe define S(\u03c9) \u2208 R2\u00d72 and H \u2208 R1\u00d72 as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 \u03c9\nS(\u03c9) :=\n, H := [0 1] .\n\u2212\u03c9 0\n1 This\n\nis another way of saying that the graph contains a spanning tree.\n\n3\n\n\f\u03b313(s)\n\n\u03b323(s)\n\ns\n\ns\n\n\u03b324(s)\n\n\u03b332(s)\n\ns\n\ns\n\nFigure 1: Some examples of coupling functions.\n\nThen we rewrite (1) as\n\u03be\u0307i = S(\u03c9)\u03bei + H T\n\nX\n\n\u03b3ij (H(\u03bej \u2212 \u03bei )) .\n\n(2)\n\nj6=i\n\nLet us recall the geometric meanings of the terms in (2). The first term S(\u03c9)\u03bei\ndefines a rotation (with\nP period 2\u03c0/\u03c9) since S(\u03c9) is a skew-symmetric matrix.\nThe second term H T\n\u03b3ij (H(\u03bej \u2212 \u03bei )) induces a contraction in the direction\nspecified by vector H T (so to speak, along the vertical axis) such that the\nprojections of states \u03bei on the vertical axis tend to approach each other. The\ncombined effect of these two terms is relatively more difficult to visualize. One\ntrick to partially overcome this difficulty is to look at the system from the point\nof view of the observer that sits on a rotating frame of reference.\nUnder change of coordinates xi (t) := e\u2212S(\u03c9)t \u03bei (t) we can by (2) write\nX\nT\n\u1e8bi = eS(\u03c9) t H T\n\u03b3ij (HeS(\u03c9)t (xj \u2212 xi ))\nj6=i\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2212 sin \u03c9t\ncos \u03c9t\n\n\u0015X\n\n\u03b3ij ([\u2212 sin \u03c9t cos \u03c9t](xj \u2212 xi )) .\n\n(3)\n\nj6=i\n\nSince the change of coordinates is realized via rotation matrix e\u2212S(\u03c9)t , the\n4\n\n\fn1\n\nn2\n\nn3\n\nn4\n\nFigure 2: Graph of interconnection C.\n\nrelative distances are preserved, that is |xi (t)\u2212xj (t)| = |\u03bei (t)\u2212\u03bej (t)| for all t and\nall i, j. This means from the synchronization point of view that the behaviour\nof array (2) will be inherited by array (3). However, exact analysis of (3) seems\nstill far from yielding. Therefore we attempt to understand this system via its\napproximation.\n\n5\n\nAverage systems\n\nObserve that the righthand side of (3) is periodic in time. Time average functions \u03b3\u0304ij : R2 \u2192 R2 are given by\n1\n\u03b3\u0304ij (x) :=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u2212 sin \u03c6\n\u03b3 ([\u2212 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6]x)d\u03c6 .\ncos \u03c6 ij\n\nThen the average array dynamics read\nX\n\u03b7\u0307i =\n\u03b3\u0304ij (\u03b7j \u2212 \u03b7i ) .\n\n(4)\n\nj6=i\n\nTheory of perturbations [3, Ch. 4 \u00a7 17] tells us that, starting from close initial\nconditions, the solution of a system with a periodic righthand side and the solution of the time-average approximate system stay close for a long time provided\nthat the period is small enough. Therefore (4) should tell us a great deal about\nthe behaviour of (3) when \u03c9 \u226b 1.\nUnderstanding (4) requires understanding average function \u03b3\u0304ij . The following lemma is helpful from that respect.\nLemma 1 We have \u03b3\u0304ij (x) = \u03c1ij (|x|)\n\n\u03c1ij (r) :=\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nx\nwhere \u03c1ij : R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 is\n|x|\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03b3ij (r sin \u03c6) sin \u03c6 d\u03c6 .\n\n0\n\nProof.

In the light of this\nif we now look at systems (4) we can roughly visualize the evolution of the\ntrajectories. Take the ith system. Let j1 , . . . , jl be all the indices such that\nj \u2208 {j1 , . . . , jl } implies \u03b3ij 6= 0. These indices are sometimes called the indices\nof neighbors of system i. Then we can write \u03b7\u0307i = v1 + . . . + vl where each vk is a\nvector pointing P\nfrom \u03b7i to the state of kth neighbor system. Therefore the net\nvelocity vector\nvk points to some \"weighted mean\" of the neighbor systems'\nstates. Synchronization of such systems, where the velocity vector of a system\nalways points to some weighted mean of the positions of its neighbors, have\nbeen studied under the names consensus and state agreement; see, for instance,\n[8, 1, 6]. The finding of those works is roughly that if the interconnection is\nconnected, then the solutions of systems converge to a common fixed point in\nspace. We now give the formal application of this result to our case.\nLet us stack the individual states \u03b7i to form \u03b7 := [\u03b71T \u03b72T . . . \u03b7pT ]T . Define\n\uf8eeP\n\n\uf8ef\n\u03b3av (\u03b7) := \uf8f0\nWe then reexpress (4) as\n\nP\n\n\uf8f9\n\u03b3\u03041j (\u03b7j \u2212 \u03b71 )\n\uf8fa\n..\n\uf8fb\n.\n\n\u03b3\u0304pj (\u03b7j \u2212 \u03b7p )\n\n\u03b7\u0307 = \u03b3av (\u03b7) .\n\n(7)\n\nWe now have the following result.\nTheorem 1 Consider system (7). Synchronization manifold A is globally asymptotically stable, i.e., there exists \u03b2 \u2208 KL such that |\u03b7(t)|A \u2264 \u03b2(|\u03b7(0)|A , t) for all\nt \u2265 0.\nProof. By Lemma 1 we can write\n\u03b7\u0307i =\n\nX\nj6=i\n\n\u03c1ij (|\u03b7j \u2212 \u03b7i |)\n\n\u03b7j \u2212 \u03b7i\n=: fi (\u03b7)\n|\u03b7j \u2212 \u03b7i |\n\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , p. Let G denote the graph of interconnection {\u03b3ij }. Note\nthat G is connected by assumption. We make the following simple observations.\nFunction \u03c1ij is continuous and zero at zero. If there is no edge of G from node\ni to node j then \u03c1ij (r) \u2261 0. If there is an edge from node i to node j then\n\u03c3ij (r) > 0 for r > 0.\nTherefore fi is continuous; and vector fi (\u03b7) always points to the (relative)\ninterior of the convex hull of the set {\u03b7i }\u222a{\u03b7j : there is an edge of G from node i\nto node j}. These two conditions together with connectedness of G yield by\n[6, Corollary 3.9] that system (7) has the globally asymptotic state agreement\nproperty, see [6, Definition 3.4]. Another property of the system is invariance\nwith respect to translations. That is, \u03b3av (\u03b7 + \u03be) = \u03b3av (\u03b7) for \u03be \u2208 A. These\nproperties let us write the following.\n7\n\n\f(a) There exists a class-K function \u03b1 such that |\u03b7(t)|A \u2264 \u03b1(|\u03b7(0)|A ) for all\nt \u2265 0.\n(b) For each r > 0 and \u03b5 > 0, there exists T > 0 such that |\u03b7(0)|A \u2264 r implies\n|\u03b7(t)|A \u2264 \u03b5 for all t \u2265 T .\nFinally, (a) and (b) give us the result by [15, Proposition 1].\n\n\u0004\n\nLet us now go back to our discussion in the beginning of Section 4. There\nwe talked about two actions that shape the dynamics of systems (2), namely,\nrotation and vertical contraction. The combined effect of those actions on synchronization of the systems was not initially apparent. However, by applying\nfirst a change of coordinates (3) and then averaging (4) we see that it is likely\nthat two actions will result in synchronization, at least when the rotation is\nrapid enough. Vaguely speaking, rotation rescues contraction from being confined only to vertical direction and sort of smears it uniformly to all directions,\nwhich should bring synchronization. In the next section we formalize our observation.\n\n6\n\nSemiglobal practical asymptotic synchronization\n\nConsider systems (3). Stack states xi to form x := [xT1 xT2 . . . xTp ]T .

Closed set S is said to be semiglobally practically asymptotically stable if for each pair (\u2206, \u03b4) of positive numbers,\nthere exists \u03c9 \u2217 > 0 such that for each \u03c9 \u2265 \u03c9 \u2217 the following hold.\n(a) For each r > \u03b4 there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that\n|x(0)|S \u2264 \u03b5 =\u21d2 |x(t)|S \u2264 r\n\n\u2200t \u2265 0 .\n\n(b) For each \u03b5 < \u2206 there exists r > 0 such that\n|x(0)|S \u2264 \u03b5 =\u21d2 |x(t)|S \u2264 r\n8\n\n\u2200t \u2265 0 .\n\n\f(c) For each r < \u2206 and \u03b5 > \u03b4 there exists T > 0 such that\n|x(0)|S \u2264 r =\u21d2 |x(t)|S \u2264 \u03b5\n\n\u2200t \u2265 T .\n\nBelow we establish the semiglobal practical asymptotic stability of synchronization manifold. To do that we use [14, Thm. 2], which says that the origin of\nsystem \u1e8b = f (x, \u03c9t) (where f is periodic in time) is semiglobally practically\nasymptotically stable if the origin of \u1e8b = fav (x) (where fav is the time average\nof f ) is globally asymptotically stable.\nTheorem 2 Consider system (8). Synchronization manifold A is semiglobally\npractically asymptotically stable.\nProof. Consider systems (3). Observe that the righthand side depends only on\nthe relative distances xj \u2212 xi . Let us define\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nx2 \u2212 x1\n\uf8ef x3 \u2212 x1 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\ny := \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n..\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n.\nxp \u2212 x1\n\nNote that \u1e8f = f (y, \u03c9t) for some f : R2p\u22122 \u00d7 R\u22650 \u2192 R2p\u22122 . Since functions\n\u03b3ij are assumed to be locally Lipschitz, f is locally Lipschitz in y uniformly\nin t. Also, f is periodic in time by (3). Now consider systems (4). Again the\nrighthand side depends only on the relative distances \u03b7j \u2212 \u03b7i . Define\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03b72 \u2212 \u03b71\n\uf8ef \u03b73 \u2212 \u03b71 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nz := \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n..\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n.\n\u03b7p \u2212 \u03b71\nThen \u017c = fav (z) where fav is the time average of f and locally Lipschitz both\ndue to that \u03b3\u0304ij is the time average of \u03b3ij .\nTheorem 1 implies that the origin of \u017c = fav (z) is globally asymptotically\nstable. Then [14, Thm. 2] tells us that the origin of \u1e8f = f (y, \u03c9t) is semiglobally\npractically asymptotically stable. All there is left to complete the proof is to realize that semiglobal practical asymptotic stability of the origin of \u1e8f = f (y, \u03c9t) is\nequivalent to semiglobal practical asymptotic stability of synchronization manifold A of system (8).\n\u0004\nTheorem 2 can be recast into the following form.\nTheorem 3 Consider coupled harmonic oscillators (1). For each pair (\u2206, \u03b4)\nof positive numbers, there exists \u03c9 \u2217 > 0 such that for each \u03c9 \u2265 \u03c9 \u2217 the following\nhold.\n\n9\n\n\f(a) For each r > \u03b4 there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that\nmax |\u03bei (0) \u2212 \u03bej (0)| \u2264 \u03b5 =\u21d2 max |\u03bei (t) \u2212 \u03bej (t)| \u2264 r\ni, j\n\ni, j\n\n\u2200t \u2265 0 .\n\n(b) For each \u03b5 < \u2206 there exists r > 0 such that\nmax |\u03bei (0) \u2212 \u03bej (0)| \u2264 \u03b5 =\u21d2 max |\u03bei (t) \u2212 \u03bej (t)| \u2264 r\ni, j\n\ni, j\n\n\u2200t \u2265 0 .\n\n(c) For each r < \u2206 and \u03b5 > \u03b4 there exists T > 0 such that\nmax |\u03bei (0) \u2212 \u03bej (0)| \u2264 r =\u21d2 max |\u03bei (t) \u2212 \u03bej (t)| \u2264 \u03b5\ni, j\n\n7\n\ni, j\n\n\u2200t \u2265 T .\n\nConclusion\n\nFor nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators we have shown that synchronization manifold is semiglobally practically asymptotically stable in the frequency\nof oscillations. Our assumption on each coupling function is that it is locally\nLipschitz and, if nonzero, its graph lies in the first and third quadrants and\ndoes not get arbitrarily close to the horizontal axis when far from the origin.\nOur assumption on the interconnection graph is the minimum; that is, it is\nconnected.\nOne last remark we want to make is the following. If we look at (2) we\nrealize that H = [0 1] is not necessary for the rest of the analysis. In fact any\nnonzero H \u2208 R1\u00d72 is no worse than [0 1]. For instance, for H = [1 0] coupled\nharmonic oscillators would be represented by\nX\nq\u0307i = \u03c9pi +\n\u03b3ij (qj \u2212 qi )\nj6=i\n\n\u1e57i\n\n= \u2212\u03c9qi\n\nfor which Theorem 3 is valid.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
