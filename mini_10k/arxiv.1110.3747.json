However, the theoretical description of\ninteracting Fermi systems is usually plagued by the intricate quantum statistics at play. Here we\npresent a cross-validation between a new theoretical approach, Bold Diagrammatic Monte Carlo\n(BDMC), and precision experiments on ultra-cold atoms. Specifically, we compute and measure\nwith unprecedented accuracy the normal-state equation of state of the unitary gas, a prototypical\nexample of a strongly correlated fermionic system. Excellent agreement demonstrates that a series\nof Feynman diagrams can be controllably resummed in a non-perturbative regime using BDMC.\nThis opens the door to the solution of some of the most challenging problems across many areas of\nphysics.\n\nIn his seminal 1981 lecture [1], Feynman argued that\nan arbitrary quantum system cannot be efficiently simulated with a classical universal computer, because generally, quantum statistics can only be imitated with a classical theory if probabilities are replaced with negative (or\ncomplex) weighting factors. For the majority of manyparticle models this indeed leads to the so-called sign\nproblem which has remained an insurmountable obstacle. According to Feynman, the only way out is to employ\ncomputers made out of quantum-mechanical elements [1].\nThe recent experimental breakthroughs in cooling, probing and controlling strongly interacting quantum gases\nprompted a challenging effort to use this new form of\nquantum matter to realize Feynman's emulators of fundamental microscopic models [1, 2]. Somewhat ironically,\nFeynman's arguments which led him to the idea of emulators may be defied by a theoretical method that he\nhimself devised, namely Feynman diagrams. This technique organizes the calculation of a given physical quantity as a series of diagrams representing all possible ways\nparticles can propagate and interact (see, e.g., Ref. [3]).\nFor the many-body problem, this diagrammatic expansion is commonly used either in perturbative regimes or\nwithin uncontrolled approximations. However, the introduction of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo recently allowed to go well beyond the first few diagrams, and even\nreach convergence of the series in a moderately correlated\nregime [4, 5].\nIn this Letter we show that for a strongly correlated\nsystem and down to a phase transition, the diagrammatic\nseries can still be given a mathematical meaning and\nleads to controllable results within Bold Diagrammatic\n\nMonte Carlo. This approach, proposed in Refs. [4, 6, 7],\nis first implemented here for the many-body problem.\nWe focus on the unitary gas, i.e. spin-1/2 fermions with\nzero-range interactions at infinite scattering length [8\u2013\n10]. This system offers the unique possibility to stringently test our theory against a quantum emulator realized here with trapped ultracold 6 Li atoms at a broad\nFeshbach resonance [8\u201310]. This experimental validation\nis indispensable for our theory based on resummation of a\npossibly divergent series: although the physical answer is\nshown to be independent from the applied resummation\ntechnique \u2013 suggesting that the procedure is adequate\n\u2013 its mathematical validity remains to be proven. In\nessence, Nature provides the 'proof'. This presents the\nfirst \u2013 though long-anticipated \u2013 compelling example of\nhow ultra-cold atoms can guide new microscopic theories\nfor strongly interacting quantum matter.\nAt unitarity, the disappearance of an interactionimposed length scale leads to scale invariance. This property renders the model relevant for other physical systems\nsuch as neutron matter. It also makes the balanced (i.e.,\nspin-unpolarised) unitary gas ideally suited for the experimental high-precision determination of the equation\nof state (EOS) described below. Finally, it implies the\nabsence of a small parameter, making the problem notoriously difficult to solve.\nIn traditional Monte Carlo approaches, which simulate\na finite piece of matter, the sign problem causes an exponential increase of the computing time with system size\nand inverse temperature. In contrast, BDMC simulates a\nmathematical answer in the thermodynamic limit. This\nradically changes the role of the fermionic sign.

Bold Diagrammatic Monte Carlo evaluates skeleton diagrammatic series for the self-energy \u03a3 and the pair\nself-energy \u03a0 (lower box). The diagrams are built on dressed\none-body propagators G and pair propagators \u0393, which themselves are the solution of the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations (upper box). This cycle is repeated until convergence is\nreached. G0 is the non-interacting propagator, and \u03930 is the\npartially dressed pair propagator obtained by summing the\nbare ladder diagrams.\n\ngrammatic contributions are sign-alternating with order,\ntopology and values of internal variables. Since the number of graphs grows factorially with diagram order, a\nnear cancellation between these contributions is actually\nnecessary for the series to be resummable by techniques\nrequiring a finite radius of convergence. We find that this\n'sign blessing' indeed takes place.\nIn essence, BDMC solves the full quantum many-body\nproblem by stochastically summing all the skeleton diagrams for irreducible single-particle self-energy \u03a3 and\npair self-energy \u03a0, expressed in terms of bold (i.e., fully\ndressed) single-particle and pair propagators G and \u0393\nwhich are determined self-consistently (see Fig. 1). The\ndensity EOS (i.e., the relation between total density n,\nchemical potential \u03bc and temperature T ) is given by G\nat zero distance and imaginary time, n(\u03bc, T ) = 2 G(r =\n0, \u03c4 = 0\u2212 ). The thermodynamic limit can be taken analytically. The sum of ladder diagrams built on the bare\nsingle-particle propagator defines a partially dressed pair\npropagator \u03930 . Since \u03930 is well defined for the zerorange continuous-space interaction, the zero-range limit\ncan also be taken analytically. This is in sharp contrast\nwith other numerical methods [11\u201313] where taking the\nthermodynamic and zero-range limits is computationally\nvery expensive. BDMC performs a random walk in the\nspace of irreducible diagrams using local updates. The\nsimulation is run in a self-consistent cycle (along the lines\nof Ref. [6]) until convergence is reached. Full details will\nbe presented elsewhere. In essence, our approach upgrades the standard many-body theories based on one\n\nlowest-order diagram (see, e.g., Refs. [14, 15]) to millions\nof graphs.\nIn the quantum degenerate regime, we do not observe\nconvergence of the diagrammatic series for \u03a3 and \u03a0 evaluated up to order 9. Here, order N means \u03a3-diagrams\nwith N vertices (i.e., N \u0393-lines) and \u03a0-diagrams with\nN \u2212 1 vertices. To extract the infinite-order result, we\napply the following Abelian resummation methods [16].\nThe contribution of all diagrams of order N is multiplied by e\u2212\u000f\u03bbN \u22121 where \u03bbn depends on the resummation\nmethod: (i) \u03bbn = n log n (with \u03bb0 = 0) for Lindel\u00f6f [16],\n(ii) \u03bbn = (n\u22121) log(n\u22121) (with \u03bb0 = \u03bb1 = 0) for \"shifted\nLindel\u00f6f\", or (iii) \u03bbn = n2 for Gaussian [17]. A full simulation is performed for each \u000f, and the final result is\nobtained by extrapolating to \u000f = 0, see Fig. 2.\nThis protocol relies on the following crucial mathematical assumptions: (i) the N -th order contribution of the\ndiagrammatic expansion for \u03a3 (for fixed external variables) is the N -th coefficient of the Taylor series at z = 0\nof a function g(z) which has a non-zero convergence radius, (ii) the analytic continuation g(1), performed by\nthe above resummation methods [16, 17], is the physically correct value of \u03a3. The same assumptions should\nhold for \u03a0.\nProving these assumptions is an open mathematical\nchallenge. Note that Dyson's collapse argument [18]\nis not applicable to immediately disprove the assumption (i) of a non-zero convergence radius: Indeed, unlike\nQED, our skeleton series is not an expansion in powers\nof a coupling constant whose sign change would lead to\nan instability. A first important evidence for the validity\nof our mathematical assumptions is that the three different resummation methods yield consistent results. For\nan independent test, we turn to experiments.\nThe present experiment furnishes high-precision data\nfor the density n as a function of the local value V of the\ntrapping potential (see Fig. 3 and Methods). We start\nthe process by obtaining the EOS at high temperatures\nin the non-degenerate wings of the atom cloud where the\nvirial expansion is applicable. Once the temperature and\nthe chemical potential have been determined from fits\nto the wings of the cloud, the data closer to the cloud\ncenter provides a new prediction of the EOS. The process\nis iterated to access lower temperatures.\nScale invariance allows to write\nthe density EOS as\np\nn(\u03bc, T )\u03bb3 = f (\u03b2\u03bc), with \u03bb = 2\u03c0~2 /(mkB T ) the thermal de Broglie wavelength, \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ) the inverse temperature and f a universal function. A convenient normalization of the data is provided by the EOS of a noninteracting Fermi gas, n0 \u03bb3 = f0 (\u03b2\u03bc). In Fig. 4a we thus\nreport the ratio n(\u03bc, T )/n0 (\u03bc, T ) = f (\u03b2\u03bc)/f0 (\u03b2\u03bc), bringing out the difference between the ideal and the strongly\ninteracting Fermi gas. The Gibbs-Duhem relation allows\nus to also calculate Rthe pressure at a given chemical po\u03bc0\ntential, P (\u03bc0 , T ) = \u2212\u221e\nd\u03bc n(\u03bc, T ) = \u03b2\u03bb1 3 F (\u03b2\u03bc0 ), where\n\n\f3\n8.5\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\nn (10\n\n200\nz (\u03bcm)\n\n7.5\n\n3\n\nn\u03bb (\u03b2\u03bc=1)\n\n8.0\n\n-3\n\n300\n\ncm )\n\nb)\n\n11\n\nc) 2.0\na)\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n100\n\n7.0\n\n0.5\n\nd) 2.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4 0.6\nV (\u03bcK)\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\u03b5\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFIG. 2.

We normalize it by the pressure of\nthe ideal Fermi gas and show F (\u03b2\u03bc)/F0 (\u03b2\u03bc), see Fig. 4b.\nThe agreement between BDMC and experiment is excellent. The comparison is sufficiently sensitive to validate the procedure of resumming and extrapolating (see\nFig. 2). The result was checked to be independent of the\nmaximal sampled diagram order Nmax \u2208 {7; 8; 9} within\nthe error bars displayed in Fig. 2 for each \u000f. The BDMC\nfinal error bar in Fig. 4 is the sum of the conservatively\nestimated systematic errors from the uncertainty of the\n\u000f \u2192 0 extrapolation and from the dependence on numerical grids and cutoffs, the latter being reduced by analytically treating high-momentum short-time singular parts.\nThe systematic error in the experiment is determined to\nbe about 1% by the independent determination of the\nEOS of the non-interacting Fermi gas. The experimental error bars of Fig. 4 also include the statistical error,\nwhich is < 0.5% thanks to the scale invariance of the\nbalanced unitary gas: irrespective of shot-to-shot fluctuations of atom number and temperature, all experimental profiles contribute to the same scaled EOS-function\nf . The dominant uncertainty on the experimental EOS\nstems from the uncertainty in the position of the 6 Li Feshbach resonance known to be at 834.15\u00b11.5 G from spectroscopic measurements [20].

Thermometry is performed by fitting the experimental data (red) to the known portion of the EOS (solid\nblue line), starting with the virial expansion for \u03b2\u03bc < \u22121.25\n(green dashed line). In this example, the EOS is known\nto \u03b2\u03bc \u2264 \u22120.25, and the fit to the density profile yields\nT = 113 nK, and \u03b2\u03bc = 1.63. d) Given \u03bc and T , the density profile can be rescaled to produce the EOS n\u03bb3 vs \u03b2\u03bc.\n\nfrom \u0393 in the BDMC calculation. This allows us to define the uncertainty margins above and below the experimental data (see Fig. 4) that give the prediction for the\nunitary EOS if the true Feshbach resonance lied 1.5 G\nbelow or above 834.15 G, respectively.\nWe clearly discriminate against previous theoretical\nand experimental results. Deviations from the theory\nbased on the first-order Feynman diagrams [15, 19] are\nexpected, and rather remarkably moderate. Differences\nwith lattice Monte Carlo data [11, 13] may seem more\nsurprising, since in the particular case of the balanced\nsystem these algorithms are free of the sign problem, allowing in principle to approach the balanced unitary gas\nmodel in an unbiased way. However, eliminating systematic errors from lattice-discretization and finite volume\nrequires extrapolations which are either not done [11]\nor difficult to control [12, 13]. The ENS experimental\npressure EOS [22] lies systematically below ours, slightly\noutside the reported error bar. The experimental results\nfrom Tokyo [23] do not agree with the virial expansion at\nhigh temperature. The BDMC results agree excellently\nwith the present experimental data all the way down to\nthe critical temperature for superfluidity (see Fig. 4).

Even for bosons, the only analog is liquid 4 He. This\npromotes the unitary gas to the major testing ground for\nunbiased theoretical treatments. The present BDMC implementation should remain applicable at finite polarization and/or finite scattering length, opening the way to\nrich physics which was already addressed by cold atoms\nexperiments [10, 24\u201327]. We also plan to extend BDMC\nto superfluid phases by introducing anomalous propagators. Moreover, since the method is generic, we expect\nnumerous other important applications to long-standing\nproblems across many fields.\nNote added in proof: After a preprint of this work became available, new Auxiliary Field QMC data were presented [31], with undetermined systematic errors whose\nevaluation in future work is called for by the authors of\nRef. [31].\n\nMethods\nThe experimental setup has been described previously [24]. In short, ultracold fermionic 6 Li is brought to\ndegeneracy via sympathetic cooling with 23 Na. A twostate mixture of the two lowest hyperfine states of 6 Li\nis further cooled in a hybrid magnetic and optical trap\nat the broad Feshbach resonance at 834 G. We employ\nhigh-resolution in situ absorption imaging to obtain the\ncolumn density of the gas, that is converted into the full\n3D density via the inverse Abel transform [28]. Equidensity lines provide equipotential lines that are precisely\ncalibrated via the known axial, harmonic potential (axial\nfrequency \u03bdz = 22.83 \u00b1 0.05 Hz). Equipotential averaging yields low-noise profiles of density n versus potential\nV . Density is absolutely calibrated by imaging a highly\ndegenerate, highly imbalanced Fermi mixture, and fitting the majority density profile to the ideal Fermi gas\nEOS [24]. In contrast to previous studies [22, 23], our\nanalysis does not rely on the assumption of harmonic\ntrapping.\nThermometry is performed by fitting the density profile to the EOS constructed thus far, restricting the fit to\nthe portion of the density profile where the EOS is valid.\nIn the high-temperature regime, the EOS is given by the\n\n\f5\nvirial expansion\nn\u03bb3 = e\u03b2\u03bc + 2b2 e2\u03b2\u03bc + 3b3 e3\u03b2\u03bc + ...\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the virial coefficients are b2 = 3 2/8 [29], and\nb3 = \u22120.29095295 [30]. Fitting a high-temperature\ncloud to the virial expansion gives the temperature T\nand the chemical potential \u03bc of the cloud, and the EOS\nn\u03bb3 = f (\u03b2\u03bc) can be constructed. We have used Eq.(1)\nfor \u03b2\u03bc < (\u03b2\u03bc)max = \u22121.25 and we checked that our EOS\ndid not change within statistical noise if we instead used\n(\u03b2\u03bc)max = \u22120.85. Once a new patch of EOS has been\nproduced, it can then in turn be used to fit colder clouds.\nIteration of this method allows us to construct the EOS\nto arbitrarily low temperature. A total of \u223c 1000 profiles were used, with 10 to 100 profiles (50 on average)\ncontributing at any given \u03b2\u03bc.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank R.
