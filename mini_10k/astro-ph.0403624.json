E-mail: mario@space.mit.edu\n\nWe measure the metal abundance ratios in the X-ray photoionized gas located\nnear the narrow line region of a sample of Seyfert 2 AGN. The high-resolution Xray spectra observed with the Chandra high- and low-energy transmission grating\nspectrometers are compared with models of the resonant scattering and recombination emission from a plasma in thermal balance, and with multiple temperature\nzones. The abundance ratios in the sample are close to the Solar values, with slight\nover-abundances of N in NGC 1068, and of Ne in NGC 4151. Our X-ray spectral\nmodels use fewer degrees of freedom than previous works.\n\nMotivation. Our goal is to use X-ray abundance measurements to\ncross-calibrate with the optical spectra of quasars. These optical spectra\nare used to measure the star formation history of the early Universe.1\nTo Determine the Abundance Ratios, we fit the Seyfert 2 spectra\nwith models of photoionized plasmas, and then search for deviations in the\ndata from Solar abundances, as shown in Fig. 1. The fluxes of radiative\nrecombination continuum (RRC) features and the radiative recombination\n(RR) forbidden lines depend little on radiation transfer effects, so they are\nthe most reliable abundance indicators. At low continuum optical depths,\nthe recombination emission flux scales linearly with abundances. Our model\nallows us to fit the RRC and RR fluxes by accounting for the broad ionization distribution in the plasma.\nX-ray Emission Line Model. We model a photoionized plasma in\nionization equilibrium and thermal balance with a grid of zones, each with\nionization parameter log \u03be = 1.0, 1.5, ...4.5 (in c.g.s. units). The XSTAR\nplasma code yields the charge state distribution of each zone.2 In order to\ncalculate the recombination emission, we use the photoelectric cross sections\n\u2217 This\n\nwork was supported by NASA contract NAS 8-01129.\n1\n\n\fAugust 7, 2013\n\n13:23\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nproc\n\n2\n\nfrom Ref. 3, and the recombination rates calculated with the HULLAC\natomic code,4 provided by Ref. 5. To calculate the resonance line fluxes, we\nuse the oscillator strengths from Ref. 6. We assume the ionizing spectrum of\na radio-quiet quasar,7 with an X-ray power-law and high-energy exponential\ncutoff. We assume a power-law distribution of column density as a function\nof \u03be, so NH (\u03be) \u221d (log10 \u03be)\u03b2 , with \u03b2 a free parameter.9 The advantages of\nthis model are that 1) it provides a simple fit to the ionization distribution,\n2) it has only five free parameters, instead of the several dozen parameters\nin other models,8 and 3) it uses accurate atomic data.\nConclusion. The abundances in NGC 1068, NGC 4051, and NGC 4507\ndo not deviate much from the Solar values. Nitrogen is over-abundant by a\nfactor of . 2 in NGC 1068, and neon is over-abundant in NGC 4051. There\nare no signatures of starburst activity. Further work is needed to quantify\nthe systematic and statistical errors, and to compare with optical spectra.\nMg XII\nMg XI\n\nSi XIII\nSi XIV\n\nS XVI\n\nMg XI\nSi XIII\n\nNe IX\n\nFe XXIV\n\nMg XII\n\nS XV\n\nO VIII\n\nFe XXIII\nNe X\nNe IX\nRRC\n\nNe X\nFe\nXVIII\n\nNe X\n\nO VIII\nRRC\nFe XVIII\n\nO VII\nRRC\nO VIII\n\nFe XVII\nNe IX\n\nO VII\nN VII\nFe XVII RRC\n\nFe XX\n\nFigure 1.
