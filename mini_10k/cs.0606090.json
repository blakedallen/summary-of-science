In general, the channel for these systems can be assumed to be\nvery slowly time-varying relative to the transmission rate of the device, and can be approximated as\nquasi-static for the duration of one or more packet transmissions. As well, since most OFDM devices\nuse a relatively large bandwidth, the channel is frequency selective. Simulation-based approaches to\nobtain system performance in this setting are very time consuming due to the necessity of simulating\nthe system over a large number of channel realizations.\nThe complexity of simulation and the wide range of practical systems operating over this type of\nchannel motivate the relevance of, and interest in, analytical methods for obtaining the performance\nof coded multicarrier systems when transmitting over quasi-static frequency-selective fading channels. There are well-known techniques for bounding the performance of convolutionally-encoded\ntransmission over many types of fading channels, e.g. [5, 6]. However, such classical bit error rate\n(BER) analysis techniques are not applicable to the OFDM systems mentioned above for several reasons. Firstly, the short-length channel-coded packet-based transmissions are non-ideally interleaved,\nwhich results in non-zero correlation between adjacent coded bits. Secondly, and more importantly,\nthe quasi-static nature limits the number of distinct channel gains to the (relatively small) number\nof OFDM tones. This small number of distinct channel gains must not be approximated by the full\nfading distribution for a valid performance analysis, as would be the case in a fast-fading channel.\nIn the quasi-static channel setting it is also often of significant interest to obtain the outage\nBER performance, i.e., the minimum expected BER performance after excluding some percentage\nof the worst-performing channel realizations [7, Section III.C-2]. Until now, one has had to resort to\nintensive numerical simulations in order to obtain the BER performance for each channel realization,\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n2\n\nand hence obtain the outage BER performance [8].\nMotivated by the considerations mentioned above, we have developed two analytical methods\nto obtain outage as well as average BER performance over ensembles of channel realizations. The\ntwo methods are best-suited to different types of analysis, as will be discussed in detail below.\nFurthermore, in the UWB setting, OFDM-based schemes are used as spectral underlay systems\nfor previously allocated frequency bands. The resultant interference in this setting motivates the\ninvestigation of the effect of narrowband interference on OFDM systems. While narrowband interference models have been considered for impulse radio and direct-sequence UWB systems [9], there\nare no results available in the open technical literature on the effect of narrowband interference on\ncoded MB-OFDM.\nContributions: We briefly outline the main contributions of this paper:\n\u2022 We develop a method for approximating the BER of coded multicarrier systems on a perrealization basis (\"Method I\"). This method is most suitable for obtaining the outage BER,\nbut can also be used to obtain the average BER performance (Section 3.3).\n\u2022 For quasi-static channels with correlated Rayleigh-distributed subcarrier channel gains, we\npresent an alternative method (\"Method II\") to directly and efficiently obtain the average\nBER performance (Section 3.4).\n\u2022 We model narrowband interference as a sum of tone interferers (a reasonable model for evaluating the effect of one or more interferers with narrow bandwidth as compared to the OFDM\nsubcarrier spacing), and incorporate the effects of this interference into both analysis methods.\n\u2022 As a specific example, and motivated by the inherent interference in UWB communications,\nwe provide numerical results illustrating the two BER approximation methods applied to the\nMB-OFDM UWB system. In particular, we present both outage and average BER, with and\nwithout tone interference (Section 4).\n\u2022 Erasure marking and decoding [10, 11] is a promising technique to alleviate the effects of\ninterference. We study erasure marking and decoding as a mitigation technique for tone-\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n3\n\ninterference-impaired coded MB-OFDM (Section 4.4).\nRelated Work: In [12], Malkam\u00e4ki and Leib consider the performance of convolutional codes\nwith non-ideal interleaving over block fading channels without interference. They make use of the\ngeneralized transfer function (GTF) [13] method in order to obtain the pairwise error probability\n(PEP). If their technique is applied to systems with a fading block length of one (equivalent to the\nquasi-static channel), their approach is similar in some ways to Method I presented in Section 3.3.\nThe major difference is that Method I does not require the GTF of the code, which may become\ndifficult to obtain as the number of distinct channel gains (the number of blocks in the case of a\nblock-fading channel) grows [14]. Instead, we apply the novel concept of error vectors, introduced\nin Section 3.1.\nThe PEP for uncoded and coded (across subcarrier) MB-OFDM is given in [15]. However, the\nauthors apply a non-standard UWB channel model, consider only simple codes such as repetition\ncoding, and do not consider interference.\nOrganization: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the\nOFDM transmitter and receiver models as well as the models for the channel and for the interfering\nsignals. Each model is formulated quite generally, although we also mention the specific parameters\nfor the MB-OFDM system, which will be the focus of numerical results presented. In Section 3, we\ndevelop the proposed analysis methods, which allow for per-channel-realization as well as average\nerror rate approximations with and without sum-of-tones interference. Analysis and simulation\nresults for several practically relevant scenarios of interest for MB-OFDM are given and discussed in\nSection 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.\nNotation: In this paper, (*)T and (*)H denote transpose and Hermitian transpose, respectively,\ndiag(x) denotes a matrix with the elements of vector x on the main diagonal, Re{*} denotes the\nreal part of a complex number, E(*) denotes the expectation of a random variable, Pr{*} denotes\nthe probability of some event, DFT(*) denotes the Discrete Fourier Transform, Q(*) is the Gaussian\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n4\n\nQ-function [5], and \u2295 denotes the element-wise XOR operation.

We again note that the methods presented herein are applicable to the general\nclass of coded multicarrier systems operating over quasi-static fading channels, although we have\nchosen to focus our attention on the MB-OFDM system for high data-rate UWB.\n\n2.1\n\nTransmitter\n\nThroughout this paper we consider an N-subcarrier OFDM system with M-ary QAM (M-QAM)\ncarrying Rm = log2 (M) bits per subcarrier. Figure 1 shows the relevant portions of the OFDM transmitter. The system employs a punctured convolutional code of rate Rc . We assume that the transmitter selects Rc Rm N random message bits for transmission, denoted by b = [b1 b2 . . . bRc Rm N ]T .\nThe vectors c and c\u03c0 of length Lc = Rm N represent the bits after encoding/puncturing and after\ninterleaving, respectively. The bits c\u03c0 are then modulated using M-QAM on each subcarrier, and\nthe resulting N modulated symbols are denoted by x = [x1 x2 . . . xN ]T .\nAs a specific example, we consider the MB-OFDM system proposed for the IEEE 802.15 TG3a\nhigh data-rate UWB standard and recently standardized by the ECMA [3, 4, 8]. The MB-OFDM\nsystem employs 128 subcarriers, and hops over 3 sub-bands (one hop per OFDM symbol) for firstgeneration devices. We assume without loss of generality that hopping pattern 1 of [4] is used\n(i.e. the sub-bands are hopped in order). As a result we can consider MB-OFDM as an equivalent\n384 subcarrier OFDM system. After disregarding pilot, guard, and other reserved subcarriers, we\nhave N = 300 data-carrying subcarriers.\nChannel coding in the proposed standard consists of a punctured maximum free distance rate\n1/3 constraint length 7 convolutional encoder and a multi-stage block-based interleaver (see [4] for\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n5\n\ndetails). After modulation, modulated symbols are optionally repeated in two consecutive OFDM\nsymbols and/or two subcarriers within the same OFDM symbol, reducing the effective code rate\nby a factor of 2 or 4 and providing an additional spreading gain for low data rate modes. We\ncan equivalently consider this repetition as a lower-rate convolutional code with repeated generator\npolynomials. The proposed standard specifies only 4-QAM with Gray labeling. We also consider\nGray-labeled 16-QAM as a potential extension for increased data rates, and since it is also used in\nother OFDM-based standards such as IEEE 802.11a/g and IEEE 802.16.\n\n2.2\n\nChannel Model\n\nWe will assume that the OFDM system is designed such that the cyclic prefix is longer than the\nchannel impulse response. Thus, we can equivalently consider the channel in the frequency domain,\nand denote the subcarrier gains by h = [h1 h2 . . . hN ]. We also include the frequency-domain\ninterference signal J (see Section 2.3). The transmitted symbols x pass through the fading channel\nH = diag(h), and the length-N vector of received symbols r (after the DFT) is given by\nr = Hx + J + n ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is a vector of independent complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) variables with\nvariance N0 . We denote the energy per modulated symbol by Es = Rc Rm Eb , where Eb is the\nenergy per information bit.\nFor a meaningful performance analysis of the MB-OFDM proposal, we consider the channel\nimpulse response model developed under IEEE 802.15 for UWB systems [16] (a version of the SalehValenzuela model [17] modified to fit the properties of measured UWB channels). Multipath rays\narrive in clusters, with exponentially distributed cluster and ray interarrival times. Both clusters\nand rays have decay factors chosen to meet a given power decay profile. The ray amplitudes are\nmodeled as lognormal random variables, and each cluster of rays also undergoes a lognormal fading.\nTo provide a fair system comparison, the total multipath energy is normalized to unity. As well, the\nentire impulse response undergoes an \"outer\" lognormal shadowing. The channel impulse response\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n6\n\nis assumed time invariant during the transmission period of (at least) one packet. We consider the\nUWB channel parameter set CM1 for short-range line-of-sight channels [16]. We also note that, due\nto the relative complexity of this channel model, even BER analysis for uncoded UWB systems has\nproven challenging [18].\nThe outer lognormal shadowing term mentioned above is irrelevant for the fading characteristics\nas it affects all tones equally. Denoting the lognormal term by G, we obtain the corresponding\nnormalized frequency-domain fading coefficients as\nhn = h/G .\n\n(2)\n\nThe elements of hn are well-approximated as zero-mean complex Gaussian random variables [19,\n20]. This allows us to apply analysis assuming correlated Rayleigh fading coefficients (see Section 3.4)\nto the UWB channel without lognormal shadowing, and then average over the lognormal shadowing\ndistribution in order to obtain the final system performance over the UWB channel. We note that this\nis only relevant for the method in Section 3.4 - for the realization-based method (see Section 3.3)\nthe distribution of h is not important.\n\n2.3\n\nInterference Model\n\nWe model narrowband interference as the sum of Ni tone interferers\ni(t) =\n\nNi\nX\n\nik (t) ,\n\n(3)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere the equivalent complex baseband representation of the kth tone interferer with amplitude \u03b1k ,\nfrequency fk , and initial phase \u03c6k is given by\nik (t) = \u03b1k ej(2\u03c0fk t+\u03c6k ) .\n\n(4)\n\nAssuming that the interference i(t) falls completely in the passband of the receiver filter before\nsampling, we form the discrete-time equivalent interference by sampling i(t) with the OFDM system\nsampling period T , and obtain (for one OFDM symbol) the N sample vector\ni = [i(0) i(T ) i(2T )\n\n...\n\ni((N \u2212 1)T )]T .\n\n(5)\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n7\n\nTherefore, the frequency-domain equivalent J of the interfering signal considered in (1) is given\nby\nJ = DFT(i) .\n\n(6)\n\nWe note that, due to the finite-length DFT window, each single-tone interferer is convolved by\na sinc-function in the frequency domain. If fk is equal to one of the subcarrier frequencies, only one\nsubcarrier is impaired by the interferer ik (t) (since the interferer will be zero at the other subcarrier\nfrequencies). On the other hand, if fk happens to lie between two subcarriers, the tone interferer\nwill affect several adjacent subcarriers.\n\n2.4\n\nReceiver\n\nThe relevant portions of the OFDM receiver are shown in Figure 1. We assume perfect timing and\nfrequency synchronization. The receiver employs a soft-output detector followed by a deinterleaver\nand a depuncturer. After possible erasure marking based on knowledge of fk , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 Ni (see\nSection 4.4 for details), standard Viterbi decoding results in an estimate b\u0302 = [b\u03021 b\u03022 . . . b\u0302Rc Rm N ]T\nof the original transmitted information bits.\n\n3\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nIn this section, we present two methods for approximating the performance of coded multicarrier\nsystems operating over frequency-selective, quasi-static fading channels and impaired by sum-oftones interference. The first method (Section 3.3) is based on approximating the performance of\nthe system for individual channel realizations. The main strength of this method is that it can be\nused to obtain the outage BER performance (the standard performance measure considered in MBOFDM systems [3, 4, 8]). While the first method can also be used to obtain the average BER over\nan ensemble of channel realizations, the second method (Section 3.4), which is based on knowledge\nof the correlation matrix of the frequency-domain channel gains, can be used to directly obtain the\naverage performance without the need to consider a large ensemble of channels. Both methods are\nbased on considering the set of error vectors, introduced in Section 3.1, and the PEP of an error\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n8\n\nvector, given in Section 3.2.\nOne major problem in the analysis of M-QAM schemes with M > 4 is that the probability of\nerror for a given bit depends on the whole transmitted symbol (i.e., it also depends on the other bits\nin the symbol). For this reason, for the combination of convolutional coding and M-QAM it is not\nsufficient to adopt the classical approach of considering deviations from the all-zero codeword only.\nIn theory, one must average over all possible choices for c. Since this is computationally intractable,\nwe simply assume the transmitted information bits b (and hence x) are chosen randomly. For\nM = 4 (where the joint linearity of code and modulator is maintained) this is exactly equivalent\nto considering an all-zero codeword. In the case of M > 4, we have verified for various example\nscenarios that, for the two analysis methods proposed below, a random choice of b well-approximates\nthe true system performance.\n\n3.1\n\nError Vectors\n\nLet E be the set of all L vectors el (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) of code output (after puncturing) associated with\ninput sequences whose Hamming weight is less than wmax , i.e., E = {e1 , e2 , . . . , eL }. We limit\nE to only simple vectors [21], where the error path contains only one deviation from (and return\nto) the all-zero trellis state. Let ll and al be the length of el and the number of information bit\nerrors associated with el , respectively. As with standard union-bound techniques for convolutional\ncodes [5], the low-weight terms will dominate the error probability. Hence, it is sufficient to choose a\nsmall wmax - for example, the punctured MB-OFDM code of rate Rc = 1/2 [4] has a free distance\nof 9, and choosing wmax = 14 (resulting in a set of L = 242 error vectors of maximum length\nl = 60) provides results virtually identical to those obtained using larger wmax values.\nWe term el an \"error vector\" and E the set of error vectors. Note that E can be straightforwardly\nobtained from the transfer function of the code, without resorting to the GTF [13] approach adopted\nin [12], and is also independent of the number of distinct channel gains (or the number of blocks in\nthe context of [12]).\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n3.2\n\n9\n\nPairwise Error Probability (PEP) for an Error Vector\n\nWe consider error events starting in a given position i of the codeword (1 \u2264 i \u2264 Lc ). For a specific\nerror vector el (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L), form the full error codeword\nq i,l = [0 0 . . . 0 el 0 0 . . . 0]T\n| {z } |{z} | {z }\ni\u22121\n\nll\n\n(7)\n\nLc \u2212ll \u2212i+1\n\nof length Lc by padding el with zeros on both sides as indicated above. Given the error codeword\nq i,l and given that codeword c is transmitted, the competing codeword is given by\nv i,l = c \u2295 q i,l\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThe decoder employs a standard Euclidean distance metric (i.e., the interference signal is assumed\nto be unknown for calculation of the metric). Letting z i,l be the vector of M-QAM symbols\nassociated with v \u03c0i,l (the interleaved version of v i,l ), and recalling that x is the modulated symbol\nvector corresponding to the original codeword c, the PEP for the lth error vector starting in the ith\nposition, i.e., the probability that v i,l is detected given that c was transmitted, is given by\n\b\nPEPi,l (H, J) = Pr ||r \u2212 Hx||2 > ||r \u2212 Hz i,l ||2 H, J\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nIn Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we will obtain various forms for this general expression.\n\n3.3\n\nPer-realization Performance Analysis (\"Method I\")\n\nIn this section, we obtain an approximation of the BER for a particular channel realization H =\ndiag(h) and interference J , which we denote as P (H, J ). For simplicity, we refer to this method as\n\"Method I\" in the remainder of this paper. As noted above and discussed in more detail in Section\n3.3.3, the main strength of this method is the ability to obtain the outage BER of coded OFDM\nsystems.\n3.3.1\n\nPairwise Error Probability (PEP)\n\nThe PEP for an error vector el (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) with the error event starting in a position i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 Lc )\nis given by (9). For a given H and J , and after some straightforward manipulations, we obtain the\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n10\n\nexpression\nPEPi,l (H, J ) = Q\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n||H(x\n\uf8ed2\n\n2\n\n\b\n\nH\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2212 z i,l )|| + Re J H(x \u2212 z i,l )\n\uf8f8 .\nq\n1\n2\nN ||H(x \u2212 z i,l )||\n2 0\n\n(10)\n\nIt is insightful to examine (10) for two special cases:\n\n\u2022 N0 \u2192 0 (the low-noise region): In this case, there are two possible outcomes. If the numerator\nin (10) is positive, we have the Q-function of a large positive value and thus PEP \u2192 0.\nHowever, if the interference J causes the numerator to become negative, we have the Qfunction of a large negative value and thus PEP \u2192 1. That is, we either (depending on J )\nwill surely make an error, or will surely not make an error.\n\u2022 J = 0N \u00d71 (no interference): Here we can simplify (10) to obtain\n\uf8ebs\n\uf8f6\n2\n||H(x \u2212 z i,l )|| \uf8f8\nPEPi,l (H, J) = Q \uf8ed\n.\n2N0\n3.3.2\n\n(11)\n\nPer-realization BER\n\nThe corresponding bit error rate for the lth error vector, starting in the ith position, is given by\nPi,l (H, J ) = al * PEPi,l (H, J ) .\n\n(12)\n\nSumming over all L error vectors, we obtain an approximation of the BER for the ith starting\nposition as\nPi (H, J ) =\n\nL\nX\n\nPi,l (H, J) .\n\n(13)\n\nl=1\n\nWe note that (13) can be seen as a standard truncated union bound for convolutional codes (i.e., it\nis a sum over all error events of Hamming weight less than \u03c9max ). We also note that we can tighten\nthis bound by limiting Pi to a maximum value of 1/2 before averaging over starting positions [12].\nFinally, since all starting positions are equally likely, the BER P (H, J) can be written as\n#\n\"\nLc\nL\n1 X\n1 X\nP (H, J ) =\nPi,l (H, J ) .\nmin ,\nLc i=1\n2 l=1\nTable 1 contains pseudocode to calculate P (H, J ) according to (14).\n\n(14)\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n3.3.3\n\n11\n\nAverage and Outage BER\n\nThe average BER for a given interference can be obtained by averaging (14) over a (large) number\nNc of channel realizations, where the ith channel realization is denoted by H i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 Nc ), as\nNc\n1 X\nP (J) =\nP (H i , J) .\nNc i=1\n\n(15)\n\nAs mentioned previously, Method I also readily lends itself to the consideration of the outage\nBER, a common measure of performance for packet-based systems operating in quasi-static channels\n[7]. The outage BER provides a measure of the minimum performance that can be expected of the\nsystem given a specified X% outage rate, and is often employed in UWB system performance studies\n[8]. We evaluate (14) for a set of Nc channel realizations H = {H i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 Nc }. The worstperforming X% of realizations are considered in outage, and those channel realizations are denoted\nby Hout . Denoting the remaining (100 \u2212 X)% of channel realizations by Hin , the outage BER is\ngiven by\nPout (J ) = max P (H i , J) .\nHi \u2208Hin\n\n(16)\n\nIn Section 4, we will focus on results for fixed values of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), interferer\namplitude \u03b1k , and interferer frequency fk . However, in order to remove the effect of the interferer\ninitial phase, we will average (15) and (16) over 32 uniformly-distributed values of \u03c6k \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0).\n\n3.4\n\nAverage Performance Analysis (\"Method II\")\n\nIn this section, we propose a method, based on knowledge of the frequency-domain channel correlation matrix, which can be used directly in order to obtain the average BER performance of coded\nmulticarrier systems. The advantage of this method is that it allows for simple and direct evaluation\nof the average BER, without the need to evaluate the BER of many different channel realizations\nas in Method I, cf. (15). For simplicity, we refer to this method as \"Method II\" in the remainder of\nthis paper.\nFor this method we will explicitly assume that the elements of h are Rayleigh-distributed and have\nknown correlation matrix \u03a3hh (in practice, \u03a3hh can be obtained from actual channel measurements,\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n12\n\nor can be numerically estimated by measuring the correlation over many realizations of a given\nchannel model). As noted in Section 2.2, the channel models for OFDM-based UWB communication\nsatisfy this assumption.\n3.4.1\n\nAverage PEP\n\nNoting that only the \u03b7i,l non-zero terms of (x \u2212 z i,l ) in (9) contribute to the PEP (and suppressing\nthe dependence of \u03b7 on i and l for notational clarity), we let x\u2032 , z \u2032i,l , H \u2032 = diag(h\u2032 ), J \u2032 , and n\u2032\nrepresent the transmitted symbols, received symbols, channel gains, interferences, and AWGN noises\ncorresponding to the \u03b7 non-zero entries of (x \u2212 z i,l ), respectively, and form \u03a3h\u2032 h\u2032 by extracting the\nthe elements from \u03a3hh which correspond to h\u2032 . Letting D = diag(x\u2032 \u2212 z \u2032i,l ) be the diagonal matrix\nof non-zero entries and g = H \u2032 (x\u2032 \u2212 z \u2032i,l ) = Dh\u2032 , we have\nE(g) = 0\u03b7\u00d71 ,\n\n(17)\n\nE(gg H ) = Rgg = D\u03a3h\u2032 h\u2032 D H ,\n\n(18)\n\ni.e., the distribution of g is zero-mean complex Gaussian with covariance matrix Rgg .\nWe would like to obtain the average PEPi,l for the lth error vector, starting in the ith position.\nRewriting (9) including only the contributing terms, we obtain\n\b\nPEPi,l = Pr ||r\u2032 \u2212 H \u2032 z \u2032i,l ||2 \u2212 ||r \u2032 \u2212 H \u2032 x\u2032 ||2 < 0 ,\n\b\n= Pr gg H \u2212 g(J \u2032 + n\u2032 )H \u2212 (J \u2032 + n\u2032 )g H < 0\n= Pr {\u2206i,l (D) < 0} ,\n\n(19)\n,\n(20)\n\nwhere \u2206i,l (D) = y H Ay and\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef g \uf8fa\ny=\uf8f0\n\uf8fb ,\nJ \u2032 + n\u2032\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef I \u03b7 \u2212I \u03b7\uf8fa\nA=\uf8f0\n\uf8fb .\n\u2212I \u03b7 0\u03b7\n\nWe adopt the Laplace transform approach [22] to determine Pr {\u2206i,l (D) < 0}, and consider\ntwo typical narrowband channel situations:\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n13\n\nCase 1 - \u03b1k constant (non-faded interferers): In this case, we note y has mean \u03bcyy and\ncovariance matrix Ryy , which are given by\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef0\u03b7\u00d71\uf8fa\n\u03bcyy = E(y) = \uf8f0\n\uf8fb ,\nJ\u2032\n\nRyy\n\nThe Laplace transform of \u2206i,l (D) is given by [23]\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8efRgg 0\u03b7 \uf8fa\n=\uf8f0\n\uf8fb .\n0\u03b7 N 0 I \u03b7\n\n\u22121\nexp[\u2212s\u03bcH\n+ sRyy )\u22121 \u03bcyy ]\nyy (A\n\u03a6i,l (s) =\n.\ndet(I 2\u03b7 + sRyy A)\n\n(21)\n\nCase 2 - \u03b1k independent Rayleigh faded interferers: In this case, E(y) = 02\u03b7\u00d71 , and we have\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n0\u03b7\n\uf8fa\n\uf8efRgg\n(22)\nRyy = \uf8f0\n\uf8fb ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n0\u03b7 R J J + N 0 I \u03b7\n\nwhere RJ \u2032 J \u2032 = E (J \u2032 J \u2032H ), and the Laplace transform of \u2206i,l (D) is given by\n\u03a6i,l (s) =\n\n1\n.\ndet(I 2\u03b7 + sRyy A)\n\n(23)\n\nIn either case, the average PEP for the lth error vector starting in the ith position is given by [22]\n\nPEPi,l\n\n1\n= Pr {\u2206i,l (D) < 0} =\n2\u03c0j\n\nc+j\u221e\nZ\n\n\u03a6i,l (s)\n\nds\n,\ns\n\n(24)\n\nc\u2212j\u221e\n\nwhere c is in the convergence region of \u03a6i,l (s). We note that (24) may be solved efficiently either\nanalytically or via numerical integration using a Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature rule [22].\n3.4.2\n\nAverage PEP without Interference\n\nAn alternative form for the average PEP can be obtained for the special case of J = 0N \u00d71 . From\n(11), and following [24, Eq.

Note that, since P\u0304i,l in (28) is already\naveraged over H, we cannot upper-bound it by 1/2 as we did in (14) for Method I. This implies\nthat the result for Method II may be somewhat looser than that for Method I (see also Section 4.1).\n\n4\n\nNumerical Results\n\nIn this section, we present numerical results for Methods I and II introduced above. We focus on the\nparticular case of MB-OFDM operating in the CM1 UWB channel. As mentioned in Section 2.2,\nfor Method II we include the effect of \"outer\" lognormal shadowing by numerically integrating the\nresults of (28) over the appropriate lognormal distribution [16].\n\n4.1\n\nNo Interference\n\nIn Figure 2, we present the 10% outage BER as a function of \u0112b /N0 obtained using Method I\n(lines), as well as simulation results (markers) for different code rates and modulation schemes using\na set of 100 UWB CM1 channel realizations with lognormal shadowing, where \u0112b denotes the mean\nreceived energy per information bit over the ensemble of channels. The 10% outage BER is a\ncommon performance measure in UWB systems, cf. e.g. [4]. We can see that Method I is able to\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n15\n\naccurately predict the outage BER for 4-QAM and 16-QAM modulation schemes and a variety of\ndifferent code rates, with a maximum error of less than 0.5 dB. It is also important to note that\nobtaining the Method I result requires significantly less computation than is required to obtain the\nsimulation results for all 100 UWB channel realizations. For example, it took about 15 minutes to\nobtain one of the analytical curves of Figure 2, while it took approximately 48 hours to obtain the\ncorresponding simulation results on the same computer.\nFigure 3 illustrates the average BER as a function of \u0112b /N0 for 4-QAM and 16-QAM with code\nrates Rc = 1/2 and 3/4 using two approaches: Method I with an average over 10,000 channel\nrealizations (dashed lines), and the direct average from Method II (solid lines). As expected, the\ntwo methods are in close agreement at low BER. The deviation between the two results at higher\nBER is due to (a) the loosening effect of the averaging of Method II over the lognormal distribution,\nand (b) the fact that Method I is somewhat tighter due to the upper-bounding by 1/2 in (14).\nA Caution to System Designers: We should note that 100 channel realizations (standard for\nMB-OFDM performance analysis [8]) may not be sufficient to accurately capture the true system\nperformance. Figure 4 (solid lines) shows the average BER with respect to \u0112b /N0 for four different\nsets of 100 UWB CM1 channel realizations, obtained via Method I. For comparison, the average\nperformance obtained via Method II is also shown (bold solid line). We can see that the average\nsystem performance obtained using sets of only 100 channel realizations depends greatly on the\nspecific realizations which are chosen. Similarly, Figure 4 illustrates the 10% outage BER with\nrespect to \u0112b /N0 for four different sets of 100 UWB CM1 channel realizations, obtained via Method\nI (dashed lines). For comparison the 10% outage BER obtained using a set of 1000 realizations is\nalso shown (bold dashed line). We see that the outage BER curves, while less variable than the\naverage BER curves, are still quite dependent on the selected channel realization set.\nBased on the results above, it seems that performance evaluation for systems operating in quasistatic channels using only small numbers of channel realizations may be prone to inaccurate results.\nThis is one of the main strengths of the two methods presented in Section 3: the performance can\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n16\n\neasily be evaluated over any number of channel realizations (Method I), or the average performance\ncan be directly obtained (Method II), without resorting to lengthy simulations.\n\n4.2\n\nNon-Faded Tone Interference\n\nIn this section, we present results for non-faded tone interference, specifically focusing on the MBOFDM system operating at 320 Mbps (Rc = 1/2 after puncturing) with 4-QAM modulation over\nthe CM1 channel. We concentrate on the case of Ni = 1 interferer, in order to examine the effect\nof the interferer frequency f1 and the signal-to-interference ratio1\nSIR =\n\nE (||Hx||2 )\n.\nE (||J||2 )\n\n(29)\n\nWithout loss of generality we place f1 between the 52nd and 53rd MB-OFDM subcarriers.\nIn Figure 5, we consider \u0112b /N0 = 17 dB, SIR = 19 dB, and focus on the effect of varying\nf1 . We show the average BER for five different sets of 100 channel realizations (dashed lines),\nobtained via Method I. The markers (\u2217) indicate simulation results which correspond to, and are in\ngood agreement with, the Method I results for the set of 100 channels indicated by a bold dashed\nline. Figure 5 indicates that the best-case performance is obtained when f1 lies exactly between\ntwo OFDM subcarriers (interferer position 52.5), and the performance degrades as f1 approaches\na subcarrier frequency. We also note that, as seen in Figure 4 for the no-interference case, the\nperformance obtained using Method I can be quite variable when considering small sets of channel\nrealizations.\nFigure 6 shows the BER versus \u0112b /N0 for one non-faded interferer at positions 52.0 (solid\nlines) and 52.5 (dashed lines) with SIR = {28, 23, 21, 19, 17, 15} dB, obtained using Method II. For\ncomparison, the no-interference (SIR = \u221e) performance from Method II (bold solid line) is also\n1\n\nNote that the SIR according to this definition is an average over all the subcarriers, so the SIR for a specific\n\nsubcarrier may be much higher/lower than the average. For example, in the 384-subcarrier MB-OFDM system with\none interferer directly on a subcarrier, the SIR of the affected subcarrier will be \u2248 26 dB lower than the average SIR\n(since the interference on all other subcarriers is zero).\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n17\n\nshown. This figure clearly illustrates the performance degradation associated with decreasing SIR.\nAs seen in Figure 5, the best-case performance is obtained when f1 lies exactly between two OFDM\nsubcarriers, while the performance degrades as f1 approaches a subcarrier frequency.\n\n4.3\n\nRayleigh-faded Tone Interference\n\nWe now consider the effect of Ni = 1 Rayleigh-faded interferer, in order to compare the relative\neffects of interference with those of the non-faded interferer in Section 4.2. Figure 7 shows the\nBER versus \u0112b /N0 obtained using Method II for the same interferer positions and SIR values as\nin Figure 6. By comparing Figures 6 and 7, we can clearly see that Rayleigh-faded tone interferers\nhave a larger effect on the BER performance than non-faded tone interferers. For example, at\n\u0112b /N0 = 17 dB, SIR = 21 dB and interferer position 52.5, the BER with one non-faded interferer\nis approximately 10\u22125 , while the BER with one Rayleigh interferer is approximately 2.3\u00d710\u22124. Even\nfor relatively high SIR = 28 dB, one Rayleigh tone interferer at position 52.0 causes a much larger\neffect than the non-faded tone interferer at the same SIR.\n\n4.4\n\nInterference Mitigation by Erasure Marking and Decoding\n\nIn OFDM systems where interference impacts a small number of subcarriers, one simple and practical\nmethod of interference mitigation is to erase the information bits carried on the most-affected\nsubcarriers (proposed in e.g. [10], as well as more advanced joint marking and decoding in [11]).\nIn order to study the potential performance of such an erasure technique, we consider the use of\na genie which erases the subcarriers with largest interference powers. In the framework of analysis\nof Section 3, subcarrier erasures can be considered as additional puncturing and easily incorporated\ninto both analysis methods.\nFigure 8 illustrates the average BER versus \u0112b /N0 for 0, 1, and 2 subcarrier erasures, obtained\nusing Method II. One non-faded interferer is placed at positions 52.25 (dashed lines) and 52.5\n(solid lines), with SIR of 15 and 19 dB. As can be seen from this figure, the use of a small\nnumber of subcarrier erasures rapidly decreases the effect of the tone interference and allows the\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n18\n\ninterference-impaired system performance to approach the no-interference performance (bold solid\nline). Focusing on the case of position 52.5 (solid lines), we can see that using only one erasure has\na small effect on the resultant BER. This is due to the windowing effect of the DFT at the OFDM\nreceiver (see Section 2.3), which results in interfering signal power being symmetrically distributed\namongst a number of subcarriers. However, once the two largest equal-interference-power subcarriers\nare erased, performance improves dramatically. On the other hand, when the tone interferer is at\nposition 52.25, a large portion of the interference power is in one subcarrier, so even one erasure can\nprovide a substantial performance improvement. We should also note that if the interferer happens\nto be exactly at the subcarrier frequency, one subcarrier erasure will suffice to totally remove the\neffect of the interference.\nWe conclude by returning once again to the consideration of outage BER obtained via Method I.\nIn Figure 9, we consider one non-faded interferer at position 52.5, and show the number of subcarrier\nerasures required to maintain the 10% outage BER < 10\u22125 for varying SIR and different values of\n\u0112b /N0 . As expected, decreasing the SIR results in a higher required number of erasures to maintain\nthe target BER. Unfortunately, a large number of erasures compromise the code's error correcting\ncapability. As can be seen from Figure 9, eventually too many erasures weaken the code sufficiently\nthat, even with the effects of interference mostly removed, the code is not able to maintain the\nrequired target BER. Figure 9 also shows that providing an increased SNR margin allows the MBOFDM system to compensate for a larger amount of interference.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have presented two methods for evaluating the performance of convolutionallycoded multicarrier systems employing M-QAM, operating over frequency-selective, quasi-static,\nnon-ideally interleaved fading channels and impaired by sum-of-tones interference. The realizationbased method (\"Method I\") presented in Section 3.3 estimates the system performance for each\nrealization of the channel with an arbitrary fading distribution, and is suitable for evaluating the\noutage performance of systems. The method presented in Section 3.4 (\"Method II\"), based on\n\n\fSnow et al.: Error Rate Analysis for Coded Multicarrier Systems over Quasi-Static Fading Channels\n\n19\n\nknowledge of the correlation matrix of the Rayleigh-distributed frequency-domain channel gains,\nallows for direct calculation of the average system performance over the ensemble of quasi-static\nfading channel realizations.\nThese two novel methods allow for analytical evaluation of the performance of a class of systems\nof considerable practical interest, whose performance evaluation was previously only possible via\nintensive numerical simulations. The results in Section 4 demonstrate that the proposed methods of\nanalysis provide an accurate measure of the system performance and allow for much greater flexibility\nthan simulation-based approaches.\nWe have also shown that the MB-OFDM system (and OFDM systems in general) may be\nsignificantly impacted by the effect of tone interference, but that this performance degradation can\nbe mitigated to a large extent by the use of erasure marking and decoding at the receiver, provided\nthat the receiver can obtain knowledge of which subcarriers are impaired by the interferers.\n\nReferences\n[1] IEEE 802.11, \"Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, Amendment 1: High-Speed Physical Layer in the 5 GHz Band,\" July 1999.\n[2] I.
