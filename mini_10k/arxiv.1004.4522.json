Building efficient multivariate models,which help understanding the relation between a large number of possible causes and resulting effects, is\n\u2217\n\nsnarska@th.if.uj.edu.pl\n\n1\n\n\ftherefore crucial for many decision - making activities.\nDue to the works of Granger [1], Bollerslev [2] and Sims [3] Vector Autoregressive (VAR)\nand Vector GARCH (eg.BEKK,VEC) models are nowadays deeply investigated especially\nin the field of econometrics. It is believed that, the system itself should determine the\nnumber of relevant input and output factors.The \" brute force\" method involves taking\nall the possible input and output factors and systematically correlate them, hoping to find\nsome signal. One can easily convince oneself, that VAR and Vector GARCH models work\nwell for small number of input and output variables, however suffer from the so called \"dimensionality curse\" i.e. blow up with just a few factors. The cross - equation correlation\nmatrix contains all the information about contemporaneous correlation in a Vector model\nand may be its greatest strength and its greatest asset. Since no questionable a priori\nassumptions are imposed , fitting a Vector model allows dataset to speak for itself. Still\nwithout imposing any restrictions on the structure of the correlation matrix one cannot\nmake a causal interpretation of the results. We believe there exist highly non-trivial statistically meaningful correlations between two samples of non-equal size (i.e. input and\noutput variables of large dimensionality), which can be then treated as \"natural\" restrictions for the correlations matrix structure. Since however the data inside the samples can\nalso be correlated, one has to remove in-the-sample correlations first and then find some\nsignal (if any) outside the samples.\n\n2\n\nModel description\n\nThe detailed description of the ideas, that drive our toy model can be found in [4]. The\nauthors suggested to compare the singular value spectrum of the empirical rectangular\nM \u00d7N correlation matrix with a benchmark obtained using Random Matrix Theory results\n(c.f. [5]), assuming there are no correlation between the variables.\n\n2.1\n\nNotation and mathematical aspects\n\nConsider N input factors Xa a = 1, . . . , N and M output factors Y\u03b1 \u03b1 = 1, . . . , M with\nthe total number of observations being T . All time series are standardized to have zero\nmean and unit variance. The data can be completely different or be the same variables\nbut observed at different times.\nTo remove the correlations inside each sample we form two correlation matrices,which\n\n2\n\n\fcontain information about in-the-sample correlations.\nCX =\n\n1 T\nX X\nT\n\nCY =\n\n1 T\nY Y\nT\n\n(1)\n\nThe matrices are then diagonalized and the empirical spectrum is compared to the theoretical Mar\u010denko-Pastur spectrum [6],[7],[8]. This allows to find and extract statistically\nsignificant factors.The eigenvalues,which lie much below the lower edge of the Mar\u010denkoPastur spectrum represent the redundant factors, rejected by the system. They can be\nexcluded from further analysis. which slightly reduces the dimensionality of the problem\n(i.e. one gets rid of spurious correlations).However before doing that, one has to create a\nset of uncorrelated unit variance input variables X\u0302 and output variables \u0176 .\nX\u0302at = \u221a\n\n1\nV T Xt\nT \u03bba\n\n\u0176\u03b1t = \u221a\n\n1\nU T Yt\nT \u03bb\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere V, U , \u03bba , \u03bb\u03b1 are the corresponding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of CX , CY respectively.\nNow we are ready to create the M \u00d7 N cross-correlation matrix G between the \u0176 and X\u0302\nG = \u0176 X\u0302 T\n\n(3)\n\nwhich includes only the correlations between input and output factors. The singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) (c.f. [9]) is used to find the empirical spectrum of eigenvalues.The\nsingular value spectrum represent the strength of cross-correlations between input and\noutput factors.\n\n2.2\n\nSingular values and Free Random Matrix Theory\n\nTheoretical predictions for eigenvalue density are obtained using the Free Random Matrix\nTheory and assuming no correlations between the samples. The final result for singular\neigenvalue density, when there are no correlations between input and output data is:\np\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n(s2 \u2212 \u03b3\u2212 )(\u03b3+ \u2212 s2 )\nM\nM +N \u2212T\nN\n, 0 \u03b4(s\u22121)+Re\n\u03b4(s)+max\n\u033a(s) = max 1 \u2212 , 1 \u2212\nT\nT\nT\n\u03c0s(1 \u2212 s2 )\n(4)\nwith s being singular eigenvalues and\n\u03b3\u00b1 =\n\n\u0011\np\n1 \u0010\nN\nT\n+\nM\nT\n\u2212\n2M\nN\n\u00b1\n2\nM\nN\n(T\n\u2212\nN\n)(T\n\u2212\nM\n)\nT2\n\nEmpirical results are then compared with the above benchmark. Any exceptions may\nsuggest nontrivial correlations between the samples.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nApplications\n\nTwo different set of data were investigated: Polish macroeconomic data and generated set\nof data, where temporal cross - correlations are introduced by construction.\n\n3.1\n\nPolish Macroeconomic data\n\nThe analysis began with checking, whether the method described in [4] is relevant for describing the relation between the inflation indexes for polish macroeconomic indexes and\nother polish macroeconomic data published by different government and non-government\nagencies. We have used monthly M = 13 changes of different CPI indicators as our predicted variables (i.e. output sample Y ) and N = 48 monthly changes of economic indicators\n(eg. sectoral employment, foreign exchange reserves, PPI's) as explanatory variables. The\ninvestigated period was between 01.1999-08.2007 (i.e. T = 104).The data were standardized, but the factors in input and output samples were not selected very carefully, so the\ndata could speak for themselves and system could be able to select the optimal combination\nof variables. The next step involved cleaning internal correlations in each sample. To do\nit, we have used equation (1).The resulting matrices were then diagonalized and two sets\nof internally uncorrelated data were prepared. From the uncorrelated data we create the\n1\n5\n\n1\n2\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n10\n0.6\n15\n\n4\n\n0.6\n\n6\n\n0.4\n\n8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n20\n0.2\n\n25\n30\n\n0\n\n35\n\n\u22120.2\n\n40\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22120.2\n12\n\n45\n\n\u22120.6\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n\u22120.4\n\n45\n\n2\n\n48 macroeconomic indicators - input X\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n13 CPI's - output Y\n\nFigure 1: Correlation matrices representing in-the-sample correlations\nrectangular matrix G and diagonalize it to calculate singular eigenvalues. Finally we have\nused the benchmark calculated in equation (2) to compare the data with the predicted\neigenvalue density.The results show, that there exists some singular eigenvalues, which do\nnot fit the benchmark. Among them, the highest singular eigenvalue s1 = 2.5 and the\ncorresponding singular eigenvector, represent standard correlation between expenses for\nelectricity and producers prices in the energy sector.

In order to proceed a sample of 100 paths of GARCH(1,1) type and 1000 observations were generated. The steps presented in the previous section were repeated. The\ninput data were 100 GARCH(1,1) paths lagged by one observation, and the output data\nwere represented by the original set of variables. As a result we got one eigenvalue, which\ndo not fit well the assumed benchmark and is suspected to represent the memory of the\ndata. However further test to confirm the idea are still necessary.\n1\nSingular values\nBenchmark\n\nProbability for each singular value\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\nSingular values\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFigure 3: Singular eigenvalues from the GARCH process compared to the benchmark\n\n5\n\n\fConclusions and Future Work\nBoth examples show that there exists non - trivial correlation structure between input and\noutput variables.Though redundant factors add significant amount of noise in the problem,\nthe SVD decomposition allows to find only truly informative factors. This might be helpful\nin analyzing the effect of so called sunspot or spurious correlations and investigation of\ncorrelations between different stock exchanges, and will be the part of our future work.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.W.Granger, Macroeconometrics.Past and Future, Journal of Econometrics, 100, 17\n(2001)\n[2] T.Bollerslev, R.F.Engle, J.M.Wooldridge, A capital asset pricing model with timevarying covariances, The Journal of Political Economy,96 (1988), 116-131\n[3] C.A.Sims, Macroeconomics and Reality, Econometrica 48, 1-48 (1980)\n[4] J.P.Bouchaud, L.Laloux.
