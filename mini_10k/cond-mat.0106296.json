Analysis is given of the changes of dislocation motion modes with stress and temperature\nvariation. Different regimes of dislocation kink pair formation and spreading (motion in the random\npotential, in the field of random forces, the quasi-localization) are considered. Discrepancies are\ndiscussed between the theory and experimental data on dislocation velocities.\nIntroduced in 1953 concept of kinks [1] has become one of the most attractive in the fundamental\nphysics. It allowed one to describe the microscopic mechanisms of generation of the dislocations,\ndomain walls, Bloch lines etc. The theory of dislocation motion in the Peierls potential relief [2\u20135]\nhas been developed basing on the kink idea. In the present work we compare predictions of the\ntheory of dislocation motion in the deep potential relief with the experimental data on dislocation\nand kink dynamics obtained with Si, Ge, and SiGe single crystals.\nModes of dislocation motion in the Peierls relief. Theory\nAccording to a theory, several critical shear stress values exist, under which the dislocation velocity\ndependence on stress is qualitatively changed. One of them is the Peierls stress \u03c4 P =\n\n(1/b ) \uf8ee\uf8f0\u2202W ( y ) / \u2202y \uf8f9\uf8fb max separating\n\nmodes of the viscous ( \u03c4 > \u03c4 P ) and the thermoactivated ( \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4 P )\n\ndislocation motion. Here W(y) is the dependence of dislocation energy on its position in the glide\nplane (Fig. 1a), b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector of a dislocation.\nIn the first mentioned above mode dislocation mobility is determined by various mechanisms of\nthe energy transmission from the dislocation to elementary excitations of the crystal lattice. In this\nregime dislocation velocity V is proportional to the acting force V=\u03c4 b/B(T), where B(T) is the\ndynamical drag increasing with the temperature T. So V decreases with temperature in this regime.\nWith \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4 P dislocation motion occurs by the thermoactivated nucleation and spreading of the kink\npairs. Unlike the viscous motion, in the thermoactivated mode dislocation velocity increases with a\ntemperature V~exp(-U/kT). Here U denotes the activation energy; k is the Boltzman constant.\nThermoactivated dislocation motion is determined by the probability (per unit time per unit\nlength of a dislocation) of the nucleation of a kink pair of critical size stable to collapse J, and the\nkink drift velocity vk along a dislocation line. Dislocation velocity does not depend on its length if\nthe last is greater than the kink free path [2]\nV = a ( 2 vk J )\n\n1/ 2\n\n, vk = (Dk /kT) \u03c4ab, Dk = \u03bd D b2 exp( \u2212Wm / kT )\n\n(1)\n\nHere a is the kink height, i.e. the distance between Peierls valleys; \u03c4 is the shear stress; Dk is the\nkink diffusivity; \u03bdD is the Debye frequency; Wm is the activation energy of the kink migration in the\nsecondary Peierls relief.\n\n\f2\n\nThe rate of a kink pair formation J depends on the shear stress. The critical collapse-stable kink\npair size is large under small stresses \u03c4 < 0.1 \u03c4p; and the energy of a pair of kinks separated by a\ndistance x is described by the equation [3]\nU ( x ) = 2U k \u2212 \u03c4 abx \u2212 \u03b1 / x\n(2)\nwhere \u00e1 is a constant of long-range elastic kink-antikink interaction; Uk is the energy of a single\nkink. Plot U ( x ) has the shape of a barrier (Fig. 1c) and a kink pair has to grow to the collapsestable size before kinks could spread by a drift under applied stress \u03c4. Probability of the kink pair\nnucleation is [5]:\n\uf8eb 2 U k - \u03c4 ab\u03b1 \uf8f6\nD U W \" (\u03c4 ab)3 / 4\n\uf8ec\u2212\n\uf8f7\nJ \u2248 k k 3 / 20\nexp\n(3)\n1/ 4\nkT\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03ba\u03b1\n( kT )\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n2\n2\nwhere W0\u2032\u2032 = (d W / dy ) y =0 ; \u03ba is the dislocation line tension.\n\n(\n\n)\n\nFor higher stresses (\u03c4p > \u03c4 > 0.1\u03c4p) the short-range exponential interaction [6] predominates in\nthe kink pair interaction\nU ( x ) = 2U k \u2212 \u03c4 abx \u2212 ( a 2 / 2 ) \u03baW0\u2032\u2032exp( \u2212 W0\u2032\u2032/ \u03ba x )\n(4)\nThe critical collapse-stable kink pair size is of the order of a kink width, so it cannot be considered\nas a pair of isolated kinks, but as a whole excited state. It decays into the separate kink and antikink,\ngiving rise to the dislocation motion. In this region J depends exponentially on stress (as well as the\ndislocation velocity) [5]\n\n(\n\n)\n\nJ \u2248 J 0 exp \uf8ee- 2U k \u2212 \u03c4 ab \u03ba / W \u2032\u2032 ln (\u03c0\u03c4 P / \u03c4 ) / kT \uf8f9\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(5)\n\n(\n\nThe activation energy of the kink pair formation under low stresses (\u03c4 <0.1\u03c4p), U 0 = 2 U k - \u03c4 ab\u03b1\n\n)\n\ndepends weakly on stress as well as the dislocation velocity (1).\nSo, according to a theory, the potential relief of perfect crystal lattice determines two modes of\ndislocation mobility: the viscous motion (region III in Fig.2) and the thermoactivated motion\n(regions I and II in Fig.2). Thermoactivated regime of dislocation motion may proceed by two\ndifferent modes of the formation of kink pairs of critical size: the diffusive, determining by Eq. (3)\n(region I in Fig. 2) and nondiffusive, determining by Eq. (5) (region II in Fig.2).\nComparison of the theory predictions with experimental data on dislocation mobility\nLet us compare the theory predictions with the experimental data obtained with 60\u00b0 dislocations in\nSi [7, 8] (black circles in Fig. 2). Solid line shows schematically the theoretical dependence of\ndislocation velocity on stress. The velocities for thermoactivated modes were estimated for Uk=0.8\neV and Wm= 1.4 eV. These values are average over data obtained in experiments [8\u201310]. The\nestimation of the Peierls stress [2] is \u03c4 P \u2248 (\u03c0 / 2a )3 (U k2 / \u03ba b) \u2248 900 MPa. One can see the absence of\nthe transition between the power (3) and exponential (5) modes of the thermoactivated motion.\nParticularly striking is the absence of the transitions to the viscous dislocation motion. Dislocations\ncontinue to move in the \"low-stress\" mode even under stresses \u03c4 > \u03c4 P . It should be noted that using\nthe uniaxial deformation of Si under a confining pressure, it was possible to obtain the stresses up to\n3 GPa [11]. The contradiction cannot be resolved even under the assumption that the kink energy Uk\nis equal to the total activation energy for the dislocation motion (2.2 eV). So, the dislocation motion\nin semiconductors under high stresses could not be adequately described in the context of current\ntheory.\n\n\f3\n\nIt is highly probable that new approaches should be invoked to resolve the paradox; for\nexample, the model describing the formation of a kink pair as a result of evolution of nonlinear\nexcitation of the breather type in the atomic subsystem of a crystal. The direct evidence of the\nexistence of such excitations has been obtained for the magnetic subsystem of a crystal [12].\nWith low stresses the discrepancies are also observed for the dislocation motion in\nsemiconductors [13, 14]. Experiments with Ge have revealed sharp decrease in the dislocation\nmobility with stresses approaching some low threshold [13]. The starting stresses for the dislocation\nmotion have been revealed with the stress decrease in Si [14] (Fig. 2) and SiGe [15] crystals.\nMoreover, the change in activation energy for the dislocation motion with the rise of temperature\nboth in Si and Ge has been found. The activation energy increases abruptly up to 4.0 eV in Si [16]\nand decreases down to 1.8 eV in Ge [17]. The asymmetry of the dislocation mobility has been\nfound in Si and Ge [18]. The theory of dislocation motion in the perfect crystal made no prediction\nabout these phenomena. The discrepancies can be partly resolved by taking into account the\ninfluence of point defects on the formation and motion of kinks.\nModes of kink pair nucleation and spreading in the Peierls relief in presence of point defects\nIn crystals with point defects kink mobility may be determined by different modes of the\nthermoactivated motion. Two theoretical approaches have been developed. The first one [19]\nconsiders randomly distributed along the dislocation line barriers for the kink motion (Fig. 1c, curve\n3). Both point defects near the dislocation and the dislocation core defects [20] may serve as the\nobstacles. In this approach the kink motion occurs in the random potential and is still described with\nEq. (1) but with less kink diffusivity Dk. The rate of a kink pair formation J decreases due to\nprobability for the kink pair to collapse when it stays before the obstacle. This causes a strong\ndecrease of dislocation velocity with a stress. The comparisons of experimental data on dislocation\nmobility in Si [21] and Ge [22, 23] with the theory [19] revealed that only qualitative agreement is\npossible.\nAnother approach is based on the cooperative effect of interaction of numerous point defects\nwith a dislocation [24, 25]. Attachment of point defects to the dislocation core or their detachment\ndue to kink motion causes the variation of the dislocation energy and therefore the specific step-like\ndependence of the energy of a kink pair on its size (Fig. 1c, curves 1, 4). The fluctuations of point\ndefect density along the dislocation line causes the threshold dependence of the kink velocity on the\nstress at \u03c4 >\u03c40\nvk = (Dk /kT)* (\u03c4 \u2212\u03c40) ab\n\n(6)\n\nAt \u03c4 <\u03c40 the mean kink velocity becomes equal to zero (the kink quasi-localization occurs) [26].\nActually kinks do not stop completely, but the sublinear dependence of the path length x on\ntime x : t \u03b4 , \u03b4 \u2264 1 takes place with the kink drift in the field of random forces.\nOn the other side, the inhomogeneous distribution of point defects across the dislocation causes\nthe local change in dislocation energy (Fig. 1b) and the appearance of additional internal stresses\nfavoring relaxation of the kink pair to its formation center (Fig. 1c, curve 1), that is the existence of\nstarting stresses for the dislocation motion [27]. The nature of point defects interacting with\ndislocation and causing starting stresses in Si has been investigated in [28, 29].\nExperimental data on kink dynamics and estimates\nFirst experimental estimations of the kink mobility have been obtained from the dependence of\ndislocation velocity on its length predicted by the theory of dislocation motion by Peierls\nmechanism [2]. If the dislocation length L is greater than the mean kink free path X, the steady state\ndislocation velocity V is determined by the production of the kink pair generation rate J and kink\n\n\f4\n\ndrift velocity vk and does not depend on L (Eq. (1)). However, if the dislocation segment length L <\nX, the dislocation velocity is proportional to its length V = a J L . The measurement of the critical\ndislocation length Lc = X, where change in the motion mode occurs, allows one to estimate mean\nkink drift velocity vk = V ( X / a ) . It turned out that X values for Ge and Si become rather small and\ncould be measured only by in situ HVEM technique. Using Eq. (1) one may estimate kink\ndiffusivity and the effective activation energy for the kink migration. The estimations have given a\nvalue of Wm=1.2\u20131.3 eV for silicon [9, 10] and Wm= 0.8\u20131.1 eV for germanium crystals [30].\nTo study experimentally the formation and motion of dislocation kinks in more details, the\nintermittent loading (IL) technique has been developed [8]. The method is based on the loading of a\nsample containing individual dislocations by a sequence of load pulses with the stress amplitude \u03c4i.\nThe duration of an individual pulse ti is comparable with a mean time of the dislocation displacement by one lattice parameter under conditions of the steady state motion ta=a/Vst where Vst is\na mean dislocation velocity under conventional static loading. The pulses are divided by 'pauses'\nwith the duration tp when either the stress is not applied at all (\u03c4p=0) or small enough stress \u03c4p\u00ab\u03c4i of\nopposite sign with respect to \u03c4i is applied.\nDuring the pulse stress action, in addition to thermodynamically equilibrium kinks, the extra\nkink pairs form and spread along the dislocation line. As the pulse separation goes on they become\nunstable and can collapse to the formation. By varying the duration of the pulses ti and the \"pauses\"\ntp and measuring the characteristics of dislocation distributions with respect to distances covered\none may obtain information on the kinetics of the kink pair formation, spreading and relaxation [15,\n31, 32].\nExperiments with Si [8, 33] and SiGe [15, 34] revealed that dislocation displacements under IL\ndiminish to zero with the pulse duration decrease (Fig. 3a, curves 2, 3). This result may be explained,\nin the frames of a model [27], considering the local decrease of dislocation energy in the Peierls\nvalley due to interaction with mobile point defects (Figs. 1b and 1c, curve 1).\nUnlike silicon, there are no starting stresses for the dislocation motion in low-doped Ge crystals\nand dislocation displacements do not drop to zero with small pulse durations (Fig. 3a, curve 1).\nHowever a sharp decrease in the dislocation mobility with lowering stress is observed [13]. We\nfound, that dislocation velocities in Ge [31] and Si1-xGex (x = 0.055) [32, 34], may be described\nsatisfactorily under low stresses by equation V = ack vk with vk being determined not with Eq. (1),\nbut with Eq. (6). Figure 3b shows the dependences of mean dislocation glide distances in Si1-xGex (x\n= 0.055) and Si on the relative pulse separation. One can see that the decrease of dislocation glide\ndistances is essentially nonlinear. Solid line in Fig. 3b, curve 1 shows the result of fitting of\nexperimental data with the nonlinear kink drift in the field of random forces. One can see that\nexperimental data are described well with the theory [24]. The dependence obtained with\ndislocations in Si (Fig. 3b, curve 2) may be explained qualitatively [32, 35] as a result of the\nimmobilization of dislocations with the pulse separation increase due to interaction with mobile\npoint defects.\nThe translational symmetry of a crystal lattice determines the secondary Peierls relief for the\nkink motion [2] (Fig. 1c, curve 2). The theory predicts a transition from the thermoactivated (1) at\nlow stresses to the activationless viscous kink motion. Like in case of dislocations, nobody has\nrevealed the viscous kink motion on dislocations in semiconductors yet.\nIt should be noted in conclusion that we have not considered the splitting of dislocations into\npartials. It was shown in [36] that dislocation splitting does not change the qualitative\ncharacteristics of the dislocation motion. Using HVEM it become possible to get direct image of the\nsingle kinks on the partial dislocations in silicon [37]. The migration energy of kinks on 90\u00b0 partials\nwas found to be Wm = (1.24 \u00b1 0.07) eV. The formation energy of a single kink is estimated to be Uk\n= (0.73 \u00b1 0.15) eV. These values are close to the estimations made for the whole 60\u00b0 dislocations.\n\n\f5\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n24.\n25.\n26.\n27.\n28.\n29.\n30.\n31.\n32.\n33.\n34.\n35.\n36.\n37.\n\nA.
