A variety of fixed points is discovered\nasymptotically near the AFM-critical point. Among these is a new variety of stable fixed point\nof a multichannel Kondo problem which does not require channel isotropy. At this point Kondo\nscreening disappears but coupling to spin-fluctuations remains. Besides its intrinsic interest, the\nproblem is an essential ingredient in the problem of quantum critical points in heavy-fermions.\nPACS numbers: 71.10.Hf, 72.10.Fk, 75.30.Kz, 75.40.-s\n\nTheories of quantum critical phenomena involving\nfermions rely on extensions of the theory of classical critical phenomena to quantum problems by integrating out\nthe fermions in favor of low energy bosonic fluctuations\n[1, 2]. Several experimental results on heavy-fermion\nquantum critical points (QCP's) are in disagreement with\nsuch theories [3, 4]. Some valiant efforts to address the\nproblem are being made by using an extended dynamical mean field theory [5]. As an interesting problem in\nitself as well as to gain insight to the difficult problem of\nthe lattice, we present here a systematic theory for a single impurity in a host with a diverging antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) correlation length. We show below that this necessarily leads to a multi-channel problem with a variety\nof remarkable properties.\nThe S = 1/2 localized moment is coupled to the host\nitinerant electrons, which are near an AFM instability\ndue to electron-electron\ninteractions,\nby the HamiltoR\nR\nnian (J/2)(2\u03c0)\u2212d dd k(2\u03c0)\u2212d dd k \u2032 \u03c8k\u2020 \u03c3\u03c8k\u2032 *S where \u03c8k\u2020\n(\u03c8k\u2032 ) is the creation (annihilation) operator for the itinerant electron with momentum k (k\u2032 ), and S is the localized\nspin. Due to the interactions among the host electrons,\nthe bare Kondo vertices J are renormalized. For a Fermi\nliquid such vertex corrections lead only to a numerical\nrenormalization. However, qualitatively new effects can\narise due to such renormalizations in the vicinity of a\nQCP in the host itinerant electrons. This problem has\nbeen solved for the case of a ferromagnetic instability of\nthe itinerant electrons [6, 7]. The problem of the AFM\ninstability is both physically and technically quite different.\nIn order to perform a renormalization group (RG) procedure, we first derive the low-energy effective action\nin which the momenta of the itinerant electrons are restricted within a narrow region near the Fermi surface,\n|\u03b5k | \u2264 W (\u03b5k is the energy of the host electrons rela\u2020\ntive to the Fermi level). Denote \u03c8k (\u03c8k\u2020 ) as \u03c8< (\u03c8<\n) for\n\u2020\n|\u03b5k | \u2264 W otherwise \u03c8> (\u03c8> ), then the Hamiltonian can\n\u2020\n\u2020\nbe expressed as H[\u03c8 , \u03c8 \u2020 ] = H[\u03c8< , \u03c8<\n] + H[\u03c8> , \u03c8>\n]+\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2032\nH [\u03c8< , \u03c8< , \u03c8> , \u03c8> ]. Eliminating the modes for |\u03b5k | > W\n\nin a path-integral formulation, we obtain the effective ac(0)\n(cc)\n(cf )\n(0)\ntion as Aef f = Aef f +Aef f +Aef f +.......; Aef f describes\n(cc)\n\nthe free parts of the effective action, Aef f is the mutualinteraction term among the spins of the host itinerant\n(cf )\nelectrons and Aef f corresponds to the effective interaction between the host electrons and the localized spin\nwhich is represented by Fig.1:\n(cf )\nFig.1 presents Feynman diagrams for Aef f in which\nsolid and broken lines are associated with the host electron and the local moment respectively. The exchange\n(cf )\ncouplings in Aef f has two parts: the first term j in Fig.1\nis irreducible with respect to the propagator Dk,k\u2032 (\u03c9) describing the AFM spin fluctuations of the host electrons,\nwhile the second part is reducible. The division into the\ntwo parts is such that g starts out as J while j starts out\nas O(J 2 ), as explained through the first few terms of the\nseries for j, and g in the figure. g is the coupling of the\nspin-fluctuations to the local moments which are always\n\nFIG. 1: Exchange interaction between the host electrons and\nthe localized spin in the low-energy effective action. The first\nline gives the complete interaction; the subsequent lines show\nfirst few terms of the series that is summed in each vertex in\nthe first line. \u03c7 represents the dynamical spin susceptibility\nof the host electrons.\n\n\f2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 2: Perturbative corrections to (a) the self-energy of the local moment represented in terms of pseudo fermions, (b) the\nvertex j, and (c) the vertex g describing the coupling of the local moment to the magnetic fluctuations.\n\ncoupled through electron-electron interaction vertices \u03bb\nto the fermions. The vertices g, and \u03bb are also irreducible\nwith respect to the propagator Dk,k\u2032 . \u03bb = I\u039b> (k, k \u2032 )\nwhere I is the bare interaction among the spins of the\nhost electrons and \u039b> (k, k \u2032 ) is the one-interaction irre\u2020\nducible vertex part in the spin channel for H[\u03c8> , \u03c8>\n].\nDk,k\u2032 (\u03c9) is related to the dynamical spin susceptibility\n\u2020\n\u03c7>\nk,k\u2032 (\u03c9) of the host described by H[\u03c8> , \u03c8> ] as\nDk,k\u2032 (\u03c9) = [1 + I\u03c7>\nk,k\u2032 (\u03c9)]/I .\n\n(1)\n\nNote that even in the limit of W \u2192 0 near the QCP, \u039b>\nis not singular (while \u03c7> is). So, we can safely neglect\nthe dependence of \u03bb on the cutoff as well as the momenta,\nafter Dk,k\u2032 is extracted.\nIn the limit that the energy cutoff W \u2192 0, the momenta k and k\u2032 are restricted to be on the Fermi surface\nSF . If k is represented by its projection onto SF denoted\nby K and the energy shell it belongs to \u03b5 = \u03b5k , we can\napproximate Dk,k\u2032 (\u03c9) \u223c Dk,k\u2032 (0) \u2261 D(K, K\u2032 ) as\nD(K, K\u2032 ) =\n\nAN0\ni , (2)\nh\nP\n\u03ba(W )2 + 2 d + di=1 cos(Ki \u2212 Ki\u2032 )\n\nwhere \u03ba(W ) is the inverse magnetic correlation length,\nN0 is the density of states, A is a constant of the order of 1. The retardation of the interactions is properly included through a cut-off which appears through\n\u03ba(W ) \u221d W z , where z is the dynamical exponent. This\nprocedure has been explicitly justified in Ref.[7] where it\noccurs in the same context.\nNow, consider the unitary transformation which diagonalizes D(K, K\u2032 ) on the Fermi surface SF . Assuming\nthat the impurity sits in a site with the full point group\nsymmetry of the lattice, the symmetry operations R of a\npoint group G (say, C4v for the d = 2 square symmetry)\nmay be used such that it is enough to find eigenvalues\nof D(K, K\u2032 ) with K restricted to an irreducible portion\nof the Brillouin zone, \u03a9 (a triangle determined by the\nvertices (0, 0), (\u03c0, 0), and (\u03c0, \u03c0) for C4v ). We obtain\nZ\n\nd\u03b1\nX\n\nK\u2032 \u2208\u03a9 m\u2032 =1\n\nR\n\nD\u03b1 (K, K\u2032 )m,m\u2032 ul (K\u2032 )m\u2032 = Dl (\u03ba)ul (K)m ,\n\nstands\nfor\nK\nR\nN0\u22121 (2\u03c0)\u2212d k \u03b4(\u03b5k );\n\u2032\n\u2217\nR\u2208G RD(K, K )\u0393\u03b1 (R)m,m\u2032 .\n\nHere\nS ,\nPF\n\n(3)\nthe\naverage\nover\nD\u03b1 (K, K\u2032 )m,m\u2032\n=\n\u0393\u03b1 (R) is the unitary\n\nmatrix for the irreducible representation \u03b1, the dimension of which is d\u03b1 . Therefore, l can be represented by\na set of \u03b1 and i in which i tells apart eigenvalues in\nthe space of {1, 2, . . . , d\u03b1 } \u2297 {K|K \u2208 \u03a9} for each \u03b1.\nIn the whole space of the Fermi surface, the number\nof degeneracies dl is equal to d\u03b1 . This general result\nis always true but more interesting is the generic case\nin which the AFM vectors Q, (assumed commensurate\n[8]) connects points on the Fermi-surface (\"hot-spots\"\nin 2-d but \"hot-lines\" in 3-d). In that case the problem\nacquires larger degeneracies.\nP\nExpanding \u03c8k as \u03c8k = \u03c8K,\u03b5 =\nl,m ul (K)m \u03c8l,m,\u03b5 ,\nthe equation represented by Fig.1 leads to the effective\ninteraction of the local moment:\n1X\n[jl + g\u03bbDl (\u03ba)] a\u2020l,m \u03c3al,m * S ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nl,m\n\nR\nwhere al,m is defined by al,m \u2261 \u03c8l,m,\u03b5 d\u03b5. At the initial\ncutoff W0 , g = O(J) and jl = O(J 2 ) for all l so that g >>\njl for weak couplings J. Eq.(4) has the form of a multichannel Kondo Hamiltonian with the number of channel\ndl for each l, but the interactions depend explicitly on W\nthrough \u03ba.\nThe RG equations for Eq.(4) are now derived for any\ngiven Dl (\u03ba). Fig.2 presents perturbative corrections up\nto the third order of j and g in the successive elimination\nof modes for W \u2032 < \u03b5k \u2264 W . Define a crossover parameter\nW1 \u223c rW0 ; r is the distance from\np the QCP. For the\n> W1 ,\npresent case of z = 2, \u03ba/\u03ba0 = W/W0 for W \u221a\ni.e. the \"quasi-classical\" regime while \u03ba/\u03ba0 = r for\nW < W1 , i.e. the quantum regime. \u03ba0 is a constant of the\norder of 1. In this paper we present results only for the\n\"quasi-classical\"\n\u0003 . It is also useful to introduce \u01eb \u2261\n\u0002 P regime\n(d/dt) ln \u03bb2 l dl Dl2 with t = ln(W0 /W ).

Note that \u01eb = (4 \u2212\nd)/2 for W > W1 , (while \u01eb = 0 for W < W1 as for Fermi\nliquids.)\nIt is convenient to write the RG equations in\nterms of\npP\n2\nt\u0304 = ln(\u03ba0 /\u03ba)2 and\nto\nrescale\ng\nand\nD\nas\n\u1e21\n=\ng\u03bb\nl\nl dl Dl\npP\n2\nand D\u0304l = DP\nl/\nl dl DR\nl .

We have done this for 2-d as well as 3-d analytically for \u03ba \u2192 0 and checked it numerically for a range\nof \u03ba. Fig.3 shows dependence of D\u0304l on \u03ba obtained from\nnumerical solutions of Eq.(3) in a 2d square lattice with\na\n\u221a circular Fermi line at half filling (the Fermi radius is\n2\u03c0). In this case the Fermi surface has 8 \"hot-spots\",\nwhich are four pairs of points connected by the AFM\nwave-vector Q. In the case of C4v , there exist five irreducible representations in which d\u03b1 = 1 for \u03b1 = A1 , A2 ,\nB1 , and B2 while d\u03b1 = 2 for \u03b1 = E. We find quite clearly\nthat the absolute values of eight eigenvalues approach\neach other and A1 , B2 , and E (A2 , B1 , and E) states\nbunch up to constitute four-fold degenerate states with\na positive (negative) value of D\u0304l in the limit of \u03ba \u2192 0.\nFrom the inset\nthat the results are conPit can2 be checked\n2\nd\nD\n\u221d\n1/\u03ba\n,\ni.e.,\n\u01eb = 1, so that |Dl |\nsistent with\nl\nl\nl\ndiverge as 1/\u03ba for all l.\nThe above realization of symmetry higher than that of\nthe underlying lattice near the QCP can be understood\nfrom a general point of view; the 2-d example is explained\nhere. Consider a Fermi line with Nh = 2nh equivalent hot\nspots, divided into nh pairs with one member of the pair\nconnected to the other by Q. Let K1h and K2h be the\nvectors of two hot spots of one such pair, i.e., K1h = K2h\n+ Q, and e1h and e2h be the unit vectors tangent to the\nFermi line at these two hot spots. If we write K = K\u03beh\n+ p e\u03beh and K\u2032 = K\u03b7h + p\u2032 e\u03b7h in which \u03be = 1 and \u03b7 = 2 or\nvice-versa near these hot spots, then the singular parts\nof D(K, K\u2032 ) can be approximated by\nD(K, K\u2032 ) \u2243\n\n\u03ba2\n\n+\n\np2\n\nN0\n,\n+\n\u2212 2p p\u2032 cos \u03b8h\np\u20322\n\n(6)\n\nwhere cos \u03b8h is given by e1h p\n* e2h . Substituting Eq.(6) into\nP\n\u22121\n2\n, the eigenEq.(3), and dividing it by\nl dl Dl \u221d \u03ba\nvalues of D\u0304l (\u03ba) in the limit of \u03ba \u2192 0 can be obtained by\nsolving the following equation:\nZ \u221e\n2\nX\nD\u0304(x, y)\u03be\u03b7 ul (y)\u03b7m = D\u0304l (0)ul (x)\u03bem ,\n(7)\ndy\n\u2212\u221e\n\nul (x)\u03bem\n\nwhere\ngiven by\n\nD\u0304(x, y)\u03be\u03b7\n\n\u03b7=1\n\n= ul (K\u03beh + \u03baxe\u03beh )m ; the kernel D\u0304(x, y)\u03be\u03b7 is\n=\n\nr\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b7\u03be\nsin \u03b8h\n,\n8\u03c0 1 + x2 + y 2 \u2212 2xy cos \u03b8h\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03b7\u03be is 1 for \u03be = \u03b7 otherwise 0.

For Nh = 8 as in Fig.3, the hot spots are connected\nby the operations of C4v which is the symmetry of the\nunderlying lattice. For a special case of Nh = 4, e.g. the\ncircular Fermi line with the Fermi radius |Q|/2, the hot\nspots are connected by the operations of C4 the number\nof which is 4. The number of degeneracies is then half of\nthe number of the symmetry operations in the group of\nthe hot spots.\nEqs.(7) and (8) suggest that for \u03b8h \u2192 0, all D\u0304l (\u03ba) \u2192\n0 as \u03ba \u2192 0 in 2d. We have explicitly found that the\nnumerical results are consistent with this conjecture. In\nthis case, as we explain below, the problem eventually\nacquires infinite degeneracy.\nThe situation is actually simpler in 3d, where it follows\nfrom Eq.(3) that |Dl (\u03ba)| are less singular than \u2192 | ln \u03ba|\nas \u03ba \u2192 p\n0 for any l, while \u01eb is 1/2, so that |D\u0304l (\u03ba)| =\nP\n1/2\n2\n| ln \u03ba|, i.e., D\u0304l (\u03ba) are zero for\n|Dl (\u03ba)|/\nl dl Dl \u223c \u03ba\nall l in the limit \u03ba \u2192 0.\nWith this knowledge of D\u0304l (\u03ba), we return to the RG\nEqs.(5) to study the fixed points. It is straightforward to\nprove that D\u0304l (\u03ba) approach constants as \u03ba \u2192 0 (dD\u0304l /dt\u0304\n\u2192 0 as t\u0304 \u2192 \u221e), as may also be seen in Fig.3. Therefore, it is sufficient to analyze with = D\u0304l (0). There are\ntwo possibilities for the fixed points of Eq.(5b). (i) \u1e21 \u2261\n\u1e21 \u2217 = 0. Then, it follows from Eqs.(5) that the usual\nmultichannel problem is realized. Due to the small channel anisotropy this is always unstable towards the single\nchannel Fermi-liquid fixed point. On the other hand, a\nnew class of singular or non-Fermi\nliquid (NFL) fixed\nP\n2 \u22172\nd\nN\nf\n= \u01eb. Then the\npoints is obtained for (ii)\nl\n0 l\nl\nfixed-point values of \u1e21 \u2217 , fl\u2217 are solutions of the following\nequations;\n\u0013\nq\nX \u0012\n\u2217\ndl 1 + \u03c3l 1 \u2212 8D\u0304l (0)N0 \u1e21 /\u01eb = 8/\u01eb ,\n(9a)\nl\n\nN0 fl\u2217\n\n\u01eb\n=\n4\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n\u2217\n1 + \u03c3l 1 \u2212 8D\u0304l (0)N0 \u1e21 /\u01eb .\n\n(9b)\n\n\f4\nThe fixed-point values of jl denoted by jl\u2217 are given by\njl\u2217 = fl\u2217 \u2212 \u1e21 \u2217 D\u0304l (0). In Eqs.(9), \u03c3l is either of \u00b11 for each\nl.\nOf these NFL fixed points, one in which all of \u03c3l are\n\u22121 can be shown to be linearly stable. For d = 2, this\nstable fixed point exists only when the Fermi line is almost tangent at the hot spots to the boundary of the\nmagnetic Brillouin zone, i.e. \u03b8h \u2192 0 (otherwise there is\nno solution of Eqs.(9) with \u03c3l = \u22121 for all l). For d = 3,\nthis fixed-point solution is always found.\nWhen \u03b8h \u2192 0 for d = 2, and d = 3, a study of the\nsolution of Eqs.(5) reveals that the RG flow of \u1e21 and jl\nis toward the single channel Fermi-liquid fixed point (i)\nonly for large initial coupling N0 J >> 1, i.e. for initial\ng << jl ; the Kondo temperature is so high that AFM\ncorrelations do not determine the fixed point. For the\ninteresting weak-coupling case N0 J << 1, i.e. for initial\ng >> jl , the RG flow is sucked into the stable one of the\nnew class of NFL fixed points (ii), i.e., the fixed point of\nthe degenerate multichannel Kondo problem with a finite\n\u1e21 \u2217 , as described below, is realized at the QCP.\nFor \u03b8h = 0.05 with 8 hot spots in 2d, an explicit calculation of the stable fixed point shows that |N0 \u1e21 \u2217 | =\n0.9205 and that N0 jl\u2217 = 0.06731, 0.03895, 0.02927, . . .,\nin order of size. At each value there are exactly four degenerate states in response to the enhanced degeneracy\nof D\u0304l (0). Thus a multiple degenerate four-channel fixed\npoint with a finite \u1e21 \u2217 is realized for both signs of coupling\nto the localized spin.\nIn the limit of \u03b8h \u2192 0, in 2d, i.e. the Fermi surface\ntangent\nP to the magnetic Brillouin zone, max[|D\u0304l (0)|] \u2192 0\nwith l dl D\u0304l (0)2 = 1. In this case, expansion of Eqs.(9)\nwith respect to D\u0304l (0) leads us to\nN02 \u1e21 \u22172 = \u01eb, N0 jl\u2217 = 0 for all l.\n(10)\nP\n\u221a\nSo, N0 fl\u2217 = \u01ebD\u0304l (0) \u2192 0 with l dl N02 fl\u22172 = \u01eb.\nAs P\nshown above, for d = 3, max[|D\u0304l (\u03ba)|] \u2192 0 as \u03ba \u2192 0\nwith l dl D\u0304l (\u03ba)2 = 1. Then the exotic stable fixed point\ngiven by Eq.(10) always exists. So, the fixed point looks\nlike the multichannel fixed point at which the number of\nchannels is infinity.\nIt is important to note that channel anisotropy is irrelevant at these stable fixed points for d = P\n2 as well as\nd = 3. This can be proved by noting that l dl N02 fl\u22172\n= \u01eb and dD\u0304l /dt\u0304 \u2192 0 as t\u0304 \u2192 \u221e. Then Eqs.(5) leads to\nd|fl \u2212 fl\u2032 |/dt\u0304 = |fl \u2212 fl\u2032 |(2N0 fl\u2217 \u2212 \u01eb/2) < 0 as t\u0304 \u2192 \u221e\nwhen D\u0304l (0) = D\u0304l\u2032 (0) for l 6= l\u2032 .\nThe other fixed points given by Eqs.(9) are unstable.\nIn the case of max[|D\u0304l (0)|] \u2192 0, N02 \u1e21 \u22172 = \u01eb(1 \u2212 \u01ebn+ /4),\nN0 jl\u2217 = \u01eb/2 for \u03c3l = 1, N0 jl\u2217 = 0 for \u03c3l = \u22121, where\n\n[1] J.A.

Since\n(1 \u2212 \u01ebn+ /4) must be positive or zero, there exist four\n(eight) unstable fixed points in two (three) dimensions\nwhere \u01eb = 1 (\u01eb = 1/2). If \u01eb is assumed to be small, these\nmay be related to the unstable fixed points of a multichannel version of the Bose-Fermi Kondo model in the\n\u01eb-expansion [9].\nThe difference of the results from those for the BoseFermi Kondo model [5, 9] are instructive. In the present\nwork, the bosons or spin-fluctuations enter the theory\nonly as intermediate states and not in external vertices,\nsee Figs.1 and 2. This is the consistent formulation of\nthe problem because the fluctuations arise in the first\nplace due to the electron-electron interaction vertex \u03bb. In\nRefs.[5, 9], \u03bb is implicitly included in part of the problem\nin defining the fluctuations but neglected in the other\npart, the conversion of the fluctuations back to fermions.\nThe correlation functions near the fixed point for W >\nW1 as well as the detailed properties when approaching the fixed point from W < W1 will be presented in a\nlonger paper. At this point we can only say that Eq.(10):\nfl\u2217 \u2192 0 suggests a decoupling of the local moment from\nthe conduction electrons, while a finite \u1e21 \u2217 at the fixed\npoint suggests that the moment responds to the AFM\ncorrelations of the host. This is what may be expected\nif the Kondo effect is deconstructed such that the local\nmoment is at least partially recovered and the recovered\nmoment participates in the AFM correlations [10]. The\ninfinite degeneracy at the fixed point suggests that the\nground state has finite entropy. This degeneracy may also\nbe understood as the prelude to the participation of the\nmoment in the infinite range spin-wave correlations below the AFM transition. This infinite channel fixed point\nmay be thought of as the analog for staggered magnetization correlations of what happens for growing FM correlations [6], where a droplet of size \u03ba\u22121 around the impurity leads to number of channels \u221d \u03ba\u2212(d\u22121) [11]. However\nthis analogy is only suggestive both because of the special condition of \"hot-spots\" or \"hot-lines\" required to\nget such a fixed point as well as the very special second\nproperty, on fl\u22172 , noted after Eq.(10) at the fixed point.\nHM and CMV are grateful to D.
