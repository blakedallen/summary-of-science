K. Raychaudhuri\n(AKR) had a fascinatingly engaging love affair with the notion of a\nspacetime singularity at the two ends of his research career. One of his\nearly concerns was to construct a model of a collapsing homogeneous\ndust ball (he was unaware of Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse) and show\nthat nothing prevented the ball from collapsing down to the centre\nr = 0 and thereby demystify the so called Schwarzschild singularity\nat r = 2M [1]. Then he addressed the most pertinent question of his\ntime: is the cosmic singularity predicted by the FRW model an artifact of the homogeneity and isotropy of space or not? As he explained\nin his reminiscences [2], inspired by the famous G\u00f6del solution, he\nwas looking for a rotating non-singular solution without closed timelike lines. In the process, he discovered his celebrated equation [3]\nwhich made the singularity analysis free of these restrictions. That\nultimately led to the powerful Hawking-Pensrose singularity theorems\n\n1\n\n\f[4] which established in a very general setting the inevitability of the\noccurrence of singularities in Einstein gravity under reasonable energy\nand causality conditions.\nThe other end phase began in the mid 1990s. The singularity theorems reigned supreme, particularly since the observation of CMBR\n[5] had pointed to a singular birth of the Universe in a big bang.\nNothing could be happier and more persuasive than observation verifying the prediction of theory. This gave rise to a general belief that\nsingularities were inevitable in general relativity (GR) so long as the\ndynamics were governed by Einstein's equations and moreover positive energy and causality conditions were respected. However, this\nbelief was shaken by Senovilla's discovery in 1990 of a singularity free\ncosmological solution [6] which did not violate the energy and causality conditions. How could such a thing happen? It brought forth the\nmain suspect in the proofs of the singularity theorems. Apart from\nthe self-evident assumptions, the theorems also required the existence\nof a closed trapped surface. This last requirement is certainly not so\nobvious and self-evident as the other asumptions. That gravity should\nbecome so strong in some bound region of space that even light could\nnot escape from it is a very limiting assumption. Indeed, where gravity\nshould become how strong ought to be determined by the field equations rather than by prescription. The said assumption may, however,\nbe reasonable and justifiable for the case of the gravitational collapse\nof an isolated body. We know from the study of stellar structure that a\nsufficiently massive body could, after the exhaustion of its nuclear fuel,\nultimately undergo indefinite collapse and thereby reach the trapped\nsurface limit. In the case of big bang cosmology what is required is\nnot a trapped surface but instead sufficient amount of matter distribution for the focusing of non-spacelike trajectories at a finite proper\ntime in the past. It is a different matter that the amount required to\nthermalise the cosmic background radiation is indeed sufficient for the\nconvergence of trajectories in the past [4]. Though this limitation in\nterms of either a trapped surface or a sufficient amount of energy density was known to experts in the field, it was not talked about much,\nperhaps in the belief that a singularity free solution would never be\nfound.\nIn the early 1990s, L. K. Patel, Ramesh Tikekar and myself ob-\n\n2\n\n\ftained some singularity free cosmological solutions [7], in particular\none with a stiff fluid equation of state \u03c1 = p. During this period,\nI had several discussions with AKR. We both shared the view that\nthe assumption of the existence of a closed trapped surface almost\namounted to putting in a singularity. Nothing could come out of a\nclosed trapped surface nor could the collapse be halted or reversed\ninside it without violating energy and causality conditions. Thus a\nsingularity would become inevitable. He was also not happy with the\ngenericity condition. In his view it was too complicated and physically\nnot very illuminating. In the ICGC meeting at IUCAA in December\n1995, Jose Senovilla and I had discussions with him and he then came\nout with an insightful comment. He opined that the vanishing of the\nspace average of physical and kinamatic parameters was required for\nsingularity free solutions. We were both struck by this comment which\nshowed a new direction. (See Senovilla's acount in this volume [8]).\nAKR had started thinking about singularity free cosmological solutions, but was not yet quite taken up by them. In November 1996,\nthere was an IUCAA sponsored workshop on Inhomogemeous Cosmological Models at North Bengal University, Siliguri. I spoke there on\nsingularity free cosmological solutions. During the talk, AKR asked\nseveral probing questions and we had a very lively and engaging discussion. It was indicative of his thought process in trying to understand and resolve intricate and involved conceptual and physical\nissues. It took him a couple of years before he could start working on\nthe question of the avoidance of the cosmic singularity. This showed\nhis work ethic - deep and long period of contemplation and thought\nbefore taking up a problem. This venture took him once again to\nthe question of singularity theorems. He argued that the existence\nof singularity free cosmological solutions should be recognized and\nproposed the vanishing of the spacetime averages of all the scalars\nappearing in the Raychaudhuri equation as a necessary condition for\ntheir existence [9, 10, 11]. He later proved a new singularity theorem\nin which he replaced the occurrence of a closed trapped surface by\nthe non-vanishing of the space averages of all scalars occurring in the\nRaychaudhuri equation [11]. The vanishing of such space averages\nwas shown to be the key to singularity free cosmological models.\nThe last paper that AKR wrote was in 2004. In this he attempted\n\n3\n\n\fto deduce the Ruiz-Senovilla family [12] of non-singular solutions for\na non-rotating perfect fluid from very general considerations. His procedure was novel, though not mathematically rigorous [13]. A very\nlarge family of singularity free cosmological models including some\ncounter examples to his paper [13] had also been found [14]. It is\nhowever known that for an imperfect fluid it is easy to construct nonsingular and even oscillating models [15, 16]. The real challenge is,\nin fact, in obtaining rotating perfect fluid solutions. Apart from increasing the mathematical complexity, rotation brings in the question\nof the occurrence of closed timelike lines and consequently causality\nviolation. We have the well-known rotating G\u00f6del universe which has\nclosed timelike lines. Recall that it was precisely the G\u00f6del solution\nwhich had set him on the singularity trail. Right at the beginning in\nthe early 1950s, his main aim was to find a rotating fluid solution,\nhopefully free of any singularity as well as of any closed timelike line.\nInstead, he discovered his equation. The question remained open and\nunsolved, however. In fact, AKR returned once again to it at the end.\nIt is undobtedly one of the most challenging open problems in classical\ngravity today. Ironically, he began and also breathed his last with it\non 18 June 2005.\nAKR had the profound insight to have identified the key feature\nof non-singular solutions, namely the vanishing of space averages of\nphysical paramneters. It was the interaction between him and Jose\nSenovilla which led to the formulation of this conjecture, though each\nof them had a different perspective on it. AKR's attempt to prove\nit [11] was not entirely satisfactory and Senovilla has now proved it\nultimately [8]. This result should rightly be called the RaychaudhuriSenovilla theorem. It was perhaps the limitation of mathematical and\nanalytical tools that AKR had at his command which came in the\nway of his proving the theorem rigorously. Yet, had it not been for\nhis insight, the theorem might not have been formulated. Therefore it\nis to AKR's credit that he showd the right path in understanding singularity free cosmological solutions. If he had the benefit of the right\nkind of mathematical backup in the mid 1950s, he could conceivably\nhave arrived at the famous singularity theorems. Once again, I believe\nthat the limiting factor was mathematical technology. With utmost\nreverence and affection, I would like to acknowledge this fact in the\ntrue spirit of AKR which embodied academic and itellectual honesty\n\n4\n\n\fand objectivity.\nAfter recording the story of my understanding and perception of\nthe AKR-singularity saga, let me change gears in the next section to\nargue that his equation in a new avatar is once again badly needed.\n\n2\n\nEquation once again\n\nA singularity marks the limiting point of a physical theory. It is enigmatic and calls for a new theory. In Einstein's GR, gravity is nothing\nbut the curvature of spacetime. A gravitational singularity thus means\nthe breakdown of spacetime structure itself and hence the end of everything.\nThe forces of Newtonian gravity as well as of Maxwell's electric\nfield diverge and are singular at the central location of the mass/charge\npoint. This singularity does not disturb the spacetime background.\nRather, it indicates the limit of validity of the theory. For the electric\nfield, we go over to quantum electrodynamics to overcome the classical\nsingularity. For gravity, apart from addressing the singularity, we also\nneed a new theory for the more basic requirement of making it fully\nuniversal. So we have Einstein's theory of gravitation, namely GR.\nBut in this new theory, the Newtonian singularity not only persists\nbut in fact attains a more profound all encompassing proportion. One\ntherefore needs a quantum theory of gravity which has to address the\nquestion of singularity in the spacetime structure itself.\nGR made two profound predictions, one of the black hole and the\nother of the big bang. Both harboured singularities. In the former\ncase it is hidden behind an event horizon and hence is inaccessible\nto an external observer. Though the Schwarzschild solution was obtained in 1916 immediately after GR was propounded, its full import\nas the representation of a static black hole was not realized as late\nas the late 1960s. A star, collapsing under its own gravity, will go\non collapsing indefinitely upon the exhaustion of all its nuclear fuel\nand eventually hit the central singularity r = 0. The latter would be\nencompassed by a black hole event horizon from which nothing could\ncome out. Penrose in 1969 pronounced that any singularity occurring\n\n5\n\n\fin a gravitational collapse will always be covered by a black hole and\nthis is known as the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. Oppenheimer and\nSnyder considered the collapse of a homogeneous dust cloud. Their\nconclusion is that it collapses down to a singularity covered by a black\nhole.\nIn 1924, Friedmann obtained a non-static solution to Einstein's\nequations representing an expanding model of the universe. In 1929,\nHubble's observation of receding galaxies lent observational strength\nto this model. It was indeed a wonderful marriage of theory and observation. The matter distribution in the universe was assumed to be\nhomogeneous and isotropic. It predicted that the universe, which was\nnow expanding, would have had a singular beginning in a hot big bang\nwhen all matter was concentrated within a very small pointlike region.\nAn important question then arose. Was this singularity an artifact of the symmetries of matter distribution, to wit homogeneity and\nisotropy, or a generic feature of Einstein's gravity? That is when AKR\ncame on stage and formulated the singularity issue in all its generality and obtained his celebrated equation in 1953 [3]. The equation\nbrought to the fore the new feature that shear as well as pressure\ncontribute positively to gravity, while rotation goes the other way, as\nexpected. Inspired by the Raychaudhuri equation, Penrose, Hawking\nand Geroch then proved in the mid 1960s their powerful singularity\ntheorems [4] under very general conditions to establish that singularities are inevitable in GR so long as some reasonable energy and\ncausality conditions are satisfied.\nWithin the classical framework, just as in Maxwell electrodynamics, there is no way to avoid a singularity in Einstein's gravity. That is\nwhy one of the main goals of any quantum gravity theory is to address\nthe singularity question. We do not yet have a full-fledged theory of\nquantum gravity. There are two main attempts. One is string theory\nwhich is based on particle physics. The other is the canonical quantization scheme of loop quantum gravity which is based on GR. We\nshall follow developments in the latter since it directly addresses the\nsingularity issue.\nThe loop quantum gravity (LQG) idea rests on an important break-\n\n6\n\n\fthrough achieved by Abhay Ashtekar in 1986. He discovered new\nvariables in which Einstein's equations take a polynomial form [17].\nSince then he has spearheaded this approach. This effort is, however,\npursued by a comparatively small but highly committed and talented\nteam of researchers [18]. Even in the absence of a full theory, it is\ninstructive and insightful to apply this developing theory to idealized\nspecial cases and probe for possible signatures of quantum gravity\neffects in astrophysical and cosmological observations. Such applications, howsoever tentative, serve as good testbeds for the evolving\ntheory in regard to its right orientation and direction. With that in\nview, Martin Bojowald and others have, for the past few years, been\nexamining cosmological applications of loop quantum gravity. Such efforts have led to the subject of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) where\none considers the symmetry reduced mini superspace and then carries\nout loop quantum calculations for specific problems of big-bang cosmology, cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational collapse [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. The most pertinent question is whether\none could have some observational imprint or signature of quantum\ngravity effects.\nRecently, there have been a couple of LQC based calculations to\nlook for quantum effects in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios.\nThe first observable effect of LQC was studied on CMBR in 2003 by\nShinji Tsujikawa, Parampreet Singh and Roy Maartens [24]. It turns\nout that quantum gravity effects could avoid the big bang singularity and there could be a causal passage through it. Its imprint could\ntherefore be seen on the CMBR spectra. In a recent paper, Abhay\nAshtekar, T Pawlowski and Parampreet Singh further illuminate on\nthe quantum nature of the big bang [20]. In this context, it is worth\nrecalling one of the first attempts made by T Padmanabhan and J\nV Narlikar in the 1980s towards avoiding the big bang singularity by\nquantizing conformal degree of freedom [25]. The pertinent question\nis how to justify in the extreme high energy regime highly restricted\ndegrees of freedom or the reduced mini superspace of LQC? Both considerations suffer from this lack of justification. It should however be\nnoted that, though there is no rigorous derivation of LQC from LQG,\nthe former does have a good theoretical backup with proper caveats.\nThere has also been a consideration of the collapse of a homogeneous\nscalar field by R Goswami, P Joshi and Parampreet Singh where LQC\n\n7\n\n\feffects make the central singularity evaporate away as radiation [23].\nAn observational signature of such a quantum evaporation of a naked\nsingularity may be a pulse of intense radiation such as a gamma ray\nburst (GRB).\nWe now come back to the old question: is such an avoidance of\nthe big bang or of a collapse singularity an artifact of the symmetry\nreduced mini superspace or is it generic to LQC?. Near the singularity, curvatures are divergingly high. So it would not be possible\nto truthfully sustain the assumption of a reduced mini superspace.\nOnce again, we need another AKR today to find a new avatar of his\nequation. In other words, a new Raychaudhuri equation is urgently\nrequired in loop quantum gravity. It may, like the old one, show the\nway to new general quantum singularity (avoidance) theorems.\nIt is true that LQC deals with highly restrictive and idealized\ncases. One should, however, note that such idealized models have\nthe uncanny knack of picking up the physical essence and innate characteristic of real life phenomena. There are several such examples\nin gravitational theories. The most famous one is, of course, that of\nthe FRW model predicting a big bang singularity and similarly the\nOppenheimer-Snyder collapse of a homogeneous dust ball. Despite\nbeing a highly idealized case, the model does carry quite truthfully\nthe signature of a general collapse phenomenon. Similar is the case\nof the Schwarzschild interior solution with a uniform density assumed\nfor the interior of a star. Such an assumption is physically unacceptable since a uniform density would give rise to an infinite sound\nspeed. Nevertheless, the model picks up all the essential features of\nthe stellar interior correctly. It is remarkable that, even when such\nconsiderations are highly restricted, idealized and not even entirely\nphysically acceptable, they often correctly indicate general as well as\ngeneric features. Such may as well be the case for the highly idealized\nLQC toy models indicating the quantum avoidance of the big bang\nand collapse singularities. As already emphasized, what is needed is a\nRaychaudhuri equation for quantum gravity. It may bring forth some\nnew features like the development of a negative pressure as the singularity is approached. Until then we have to make do with tentative\nresults which may only be indicative of what the full quantum gravity\nwill ultimately establish.\n\n8\n\n\fFinally, all this should be most satisfying and pleasing to one man,\nAbhay Ashtekar. He made the path breaking discovery two decades\nback of his famous new variables which set things on track, leading\nto Loop Quantum Gravity. This idea has now matured sufficiently to\nmake contact with observations. It has indeed been a long and ardous\njourney. But, at the end of the day, nothing could please one more\nthan to see the clicking of what one had set out do. Admittedly, we are\nfar from a complete theory of quantum gravity and LQG has a long\nway to go yet. What is important is that it seems to be on the right\ntrack [26]. Recent works of Rovelli, Speziale and others [27, 28, 29]\non graviton propagators in LQG and of Smolin et al [30] on the origin\nof the standard model of particle physics from the quantum nature of\ngeometry are indeed very exciting.\n\n3\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nI thank Jose Senovilla for recounting and reflecting on our discussion\nwith AKR and also thank Parampreet Singh and Pankaj Joshi for\nclarifying comments.
