This proposal extends the holographic principle based on the lightsheet to the one constraining the entropy passing\nthrough bulk hypersurface of timelike geodesics by the boundary area divided by 4G.\nWe give a proof of the proposal in the classical regime based on a simple local entropy\ncondition.\n\nNovember 9, 2018\n\n\u2217\n\nemail: dsbak@mach.uos.ac.kr\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe holographic principle may be a key paradigm for the understanding of the true nature of\ngravity and string theories. As suggested first by 't Hooft and Susskind, it states that the degrees of\nfreedom for the gravitational system reside not in the bulk but in its boundaries[1, 2]. Furthermore\nthe number of boundary degrees of freedom per Planck area is constrained not to exceed unity.\nThis principle clearly contradicts with the current framework of quantum field theories because\ntheir numbers of degrees scale like the bulk volume not by the boundary area. These ideas are\nprecisely exemplified in the formulation of AdS/CFT correspondence[3, 4]. When the gravity and\nfield theories coexist like our Universe, the UV structure of quantum field theories must be modified\ndrastically in order to have fundamental degrees limited by their boundary areas.\nApplication of the above holographic principle to more general spacetime including cosmology\nis problematic[5]. For the flat FRW universe as an example, the matter entropy scales like the\ncoordinate volume and the bulk entropy eventually wins over the area bound for large enough\nregion. The authors of [5] suggested that the entropy crossing past lightlike region generated\nfrom the particle horizon should be bounded by the area of the particle horizon. Based on the\nsubsequent works[6], Bousso has given a covariant version of the holographic principle that may be\napplicable for general backgrounds[7]. It states that the entropy on the lightsheet L is bounded by\nits boundary area divided by 4G. The lightsheet is defined by the bundle of lightlike geodesics that\nare orthogonally generated from the boundary surface with nonpositive expansion away from the\nboundary surface. The shape of the boundary surface may be arbitrary once it is consistent with\nthe nonpositive expansion condition.\nMore stronger bound is proposed by Flanagan, Marolf and Wald (FMW)[8], asserting that\nthe entropy flux passing through the lightsheet orthogonally generated from one boundary and\nending on another boundary is bounded by the difference of the boundary areas divided by 4G.\nInterestingly this version can be proven in the semiclassical limit provided certain local conditions\non the entropy are assumed[9, 10]. The proof is utilizing focusing nature of the lightlike geodesic\nbased on the Raychaudhuri equation.\nIn this note, we observe that the Raychaudhuri equation is also for the timelike geodesics, which\nplays an important role in the investigation of the global structures of spacetime including horizons\nand singularities. We extend the above holography to the case where the bulk hypersurface consists\nof timelike geodesics. The proposal dictates that the entropy passing through the bulk hypersurface\nconsisting of timelike geodesics orthogonally generated from a codimension two spacelike hypersur-\n\n1\n\n\fface B and terminating on B \u2032 , should be bounded by the difference of the boundary area divided\nby 4G. The proof shall be given in the classical regime with simple well motivated local entropy\nconditions.\nThere is a strong supportive argument for the above timelike holography. Consider a d + 1\ndimensional geometry of the form, M \u00d7 S 1 , where M is a d dimensional spacetime and S 1 denotes\na circle. Lightlike geodesics in the d+1 dimensions correspond to timelike geodesics in the spacetime\nM if the momentum along the circle is nonvanishing. This way the lightlike holography in M \u00d7 S 1\nmay lead to the timelike holography in the lower dimensional spacetime1 .\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the covariant holography proposed\nby Bousso and extended by FMW. In Section 3, we give the proof (in the classical regime) based\non the simple local conditions on the entropy density. Section 4 deals with our proposal on the\nholography with timelike bulk hypersurface. We discuss a proof of the statement starting from\nappropriate local conditions on the entropy flux. Last section is devoted for the discussions.\n\n2\n\nReview of the lightlike holographic principle\n\nFor later use, we will review the basic construct of the holographic principle introduced by Bousso\nand later extended by FMW.\nThe Bousso's holographic principle compares the entropy on the lightsheet L with its boundary\narea divided by 4G. The lightsheet is defined by the bundle of lightlike geodesics that are orthogonally generated from the boundary surface with nonpositive expansion away from a spacelikesurface.\nThe principle then dictates that\nSL \u2264\n\nA\n4G\n\n(1)\n\nwhere SL is the entropy flux passing through the lightsheet and A the boundary area.\nThe lightsheet consists of collections of lightlike geodesics ka =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n\u0011a\n\nemanated orthogonally\n\nfrom a given codimension-two spacelike surface B where \u03bb is the affine parameter. The expansion,\n\u03b8 = \u2207a k a ,\n\n(2)\n\ndescribes the changing rate of the logarithm of the cross sectional area of the light rays with respect\nto \u03bb. The definition of lightsheet requires the expansion away from the boundary surface to be\n1\nWe like to thank Dominic Brecher for pointing out this argument. There are also discussions about the dimensional reduction and lightlike holography in Refs. [11, 12].\n\n2\n\n\fnonpositive. The lightsheet should be terminated if the expansion turns into a positive value or\nthe geodesics hit singularities.\nThough the local concept of entropy is not well defined, we introduce the entropy current density\nsa ,\n\nwhich may have a well defined physical meaning in the thermodynamic limit. The entropy flux\n\ndensity s passing through the lightsheet is given by\ns = na sa ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith the vector na = \u2212ka (+ka ) normal to the future (past) directed lightsheet. The total entropy\npassing through the lightsheet is the volume integral,\nSL (B) =\n\nZ\n\nq\n\ndy D\u22122 h(y)\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb A s ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere ~y is the coordinate for the boundary and h(y) is the determinant of the induced metric on\nthe boundary. The area factor A represents the growth of the unit area along the affine parameter\nA = exp\n\n\"Z\n\n#\n\n\u03bb\n\nd\u03bb\u0303 \u03b8(\u03bb\u0303) ,\n\n(5)\n\nq\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nand the cross sectional area at \u03bb is then given by\nA(\u03bb) =\n\nZ\n\ndy D\u22122 h(y) A(\u03bb) .\n\nMore stronger bound,\nSL(B\u2212B \u2032 ) \u2264\n\n1\n(A \u2212 A\u2032 ) ,\n4G\n\n(7)\n\nhas been proposed by FMW, where SL(B\u2212B \u2032 ) corresponds to the entropy flux passing through\nthe lightlike surface orthogonally generated from B and ending on B \u2032 before reaching caustic or\nsingularities. One compares this entropy to the difference of the area of B and B \u2032 . This version of\nthe entropy bound is the one we are interested in this note.\n\n3\n\nConditions for the holography\n\nThe latter version of the holography can be shown to hold in the classical regime with certain\nconditions on the entropy flux density are satisfied.\nHere we review the conditions and the proof given recently in Refs. [9, 10]. The entropy\nconditions used are:\ni.\n\ns\u2032 \u2264 2\u03c0Tab ka kb\n3\n\n\fii. s(0) \u2264 \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b8(0)\n4G\n\nThe second condition is on the initial condition for the entropy and the first corresponds to the\nlocal version of the Bekenstein bound as discussed in Ref. [9, 13, 14].\nBased on these two conditions, the proof of the entropy bound is very simple in the semiclassical\nlimit where one may use the Einstein equation,\n1\nRab \u2212 gab R = 8\u03c0G Tab .\n2\n\n(8)\n\nThe expansion of the bundle of the lightlike geodesics obeys the Raychaudhuri equation\n\u03b8\u2032 = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b8 2 \u2212 \u03c3ab \u03c3 ab + \u03c9ab \u03c9 ab \u2212 Rab ka kb ,\nD\u22122\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c3ab and \u03c9ab are the shear and the twist. Since the lightsheets are hypersurface orthogonal,\nthe twist \u03c9ab vanishes.\nThe FMW bound has a differential form. We note that the local inequality,\ns \u2264 \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b8,\n4G\n\n(10)\n\nimplies the integral version (7). In particular considering B \u2032 infinitesimally away from B in terms\nof the affine parameter, one gets the condition (ii) from the integral version. It is clear that the\ninitial condition on the entropy should hold without any disposal because the part of statement of\nthe holography is the initial condition itself. Since s(0) is not to do with how the boundary surface\nis curved, the initial condition is not satisfied for an arbitrary boundary surface. Rather at a given\ninitial spacetime point, one needs more curved boundary in order to have the negative of expansion\nlarger than the initial entropy flux density. Therefore the initial condition puts restriction not on\nthe initial entropy density but on the boundary surface. In Ref. [9], the authors insisted \u03b8(0) \u2264 0,\nwhich is clearly different from ours.\nFrom the two conditions, the proof of the inequality (10) is quite simple. Using (9), the first\ncondition and the Einstein Equation, we have\n\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1 \u2032\n\u03b8 =\n\u03b82 +\n\u03c3ab \u03c3 ab + 2\u03c0Tab ka kb \u2265 s\u2032 .\n4G\n4G(D \u2212 2)\n4G\n\n(11)\n\nHence together with the initial condition, one has\ns = s0 +\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\u03b80 +\nd\u03bb\u0303 s (\u03bb\u0303) \u2264 \u2212\n4G\n\u2032\n\n4\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\n\u2032\n\n!\n\nd\u03bb\u0303 \u03b8 (\u03bb\u0303)\n0\n\n=\u2212\n\n1\n\u03b8.\n4G\n\n(12)\n\n\fA few comments are in order. The first condition on the local change of the entropy is closely\nrelated to the Bekenstein bound as discussed recently in Ref. [9, 13, 14]. We shall not repeat the\narguments here. One might try using the following weaker condition;\ns\u2032 \u2264 2\u03c0Tab ka kb +\n\n1\n\u03b82 ?\n4G(D \u2212 2)\n\n(13)\n\nBut the expansion is not such a physical quantity that is fixed solely by the spacetime point. Rather\nit is determined by the point as well as by the shape of the initial surface. On the other hand, s\u2032\nand Tab ka kb are the physical quantities (of course depending on the geodesic ka ) that are nothing\nto do with the shape of the initial surface. In this respect we view that the relation (13) is not\ndesirable.\nThe saturation of the above holographic principle requires \u03b8 = 0 as well as s\u2032 = 2\u03c0Tab ka kb . The\n\u03b8 = 0 condition is particularly strict. For example in the case of AdS geometries, we do not have\nholographic screen that saturates the holographic bound. The reason is because the \u03b8 = 0 condition\ncannot hold along the lightsheet. Let us take a lightsheet in the IR region of AdS space, for which\nthe spacelike projection theorem is applicable. Then the lightsheet records all the entropy of the\nbulk inside. As discussed in detail in Ref. [4], the boundary area of AdS5 \u00d7S 5 divided by 4G located\nat the IR region of AdS space agrees with the degrees of freedom count of N = 4 SYM theory up\nto order one numerical constant. However, if the current formulation of the holographic principle is\ncorrect, the numerical coefficient cannot be unity because the bound cannot be saturated. Namely\nSBulk = SCF T \u2264 SL <\n\n1\n4G A\n\nwith SBulk and SCF T being respectively the entropies of the bulk\n\nand the boundary N = 4 SYM theory. Since the original conjecture is the equivalence between\ngravity with N = 4 SYM theory in the large N limit, the non saturation is not a problem.\nLet us give here examples where the bound is saturated. A rather trivial example is the case of\nflat boundary in the flat spacetime. The expansion and the entropy flux density along the lightsheet\nremain zero. The bound is saturated because the both sides are zero. Another is the spacetime\nof a stationary black hole, where we take the event horizon as lightsheet. There the expansion\nstays zero. Hence the difference of the boundary areas is again zero. Also s = 0 because nothing\ncrosses the horizon due to the stationary nature of the black hole. Of course, we ignore the possible\nquantum corrections including the effect of Hawking radiation.\nFinally we illustrate the use of holography for the spacetime representing the formation of\nblack hole by the gravitational collapse of star. The relevant Penrose diagram is depicted in Fig.\n1. Ignoring any quantum effect, the outside of the surface of the star is same as the vacuum\nSchwarzschild black hole solution with the horizon radius, say, RS . The event horizon (the line\nwith arrow) begins with r = 0, its radius grows toward the future infinity i+ and reaches the\n5\n\n\fsingularity\n\nr=0\n\nC\n\ni\n\n+\n\nevent horizon\n\nsurface of star\n\nFigure 1: We depict the Penrose diagram of the spacetime representing the formation of the black hole by\nthe gravitational collapse of a star.\n\nstationary value RS once the surface of star is crossed. The increase is monotonic in accordance\nwith the theorem of horizon area for the matter content of the star satisfying the weak energy\ncondition. Let us consider the lightsheet starting from somewhere between i+ and C and ending\nup at r = 0. (Thus \u03bb = 0 at the starting point.) Expansion is nonpositive everywhere. In fact\n\u03b8 = 0 at \u03bb = 0 since the radius (or area) is not changing there. At the world point C, it becomes\nnegative and keeps decreasing until reaching negative infinity at the caustic of r = 0. (\u03b8 \u2032 \u2264 0 all the\nway once the weak energy condition is satisfied.) The initial entropy condition is satisfied because\n\u03b8(0) = s(0) = 0. Using the holography bound, we conclude that\nSS < SB =\n\n1\nAB\n4G\n\nwhere SS is the entropy flux of the star through the horizon and SB (AB ) is the entropy (the\nhorizon area) of the final Schwarzschild black hole. The equality is not possible because \u03b8 is\nnonzero somewhere. The interpretation of the result here is that the entropy of star used for the\nblack hole formation is less than the final (gravitational) entropy of the black hole. In other words\nthere is a positive amount of entropy production along the gravitational collapse.\n\n4\n\nHolography with timelike sheets\n\nIn the discussion of the holography with lightsheets, the Raychaudhuri equation plays an important\nrole. The Raychaudhuri equation is, however, not just for the bundle of lightlike geodesics but also\n6\n\n\ffor timelike geodesics. In this respect here we discuss whether one may extend the formulation of\nholography to the case of timelike bulk hypersurface consisting of timelike geodesics.\nLet us consider bundle of timelike geodesics orthogonally generated from a codimension two\nspacelike hypersurface B and terminating on B \u2032 before reaching caustics or singularities. We shall\ndenote the timelike geodesic by \u03be a = (\u2202/\u2202\u03c4 )a (with \u03bea \u03be a = \u22121) where \u03c4 is the proper time along\nthe geodesic. We introduce the entropy flux density s by\ns = na sa ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere na is the normal vector to the timelike bulk hypersurface. The entropy on the timelike bulk\nhypersurface is then\nST (B\u2212B \u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\ndy\n\nD\u22122\n\nq\n\nh(y)\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\u2032\n\nd\u03c4 B s ,\n\n(15)\n\n0\n\nwhere ~y is the coordinate for the boundary and B represents the growth of the unit area along \u03c4\ngiven by\nB = exp\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u0015\n\nd\u03c4\u0303 \u03b8A (\u03c4\u0303 ) ,\n\n0\n\n(16)\n\nwith the area expansion \u03b8A . Note that there are two possible choices for the normal vector field\nna . We shall always take the one that makes ST (B\u2212B \u2032 ) nonnegative. Infinitesimally away from\nthe timelike hypersurface to the normal direction, we extend the geodesics such that geodesics are\nstill hypersurface orthogonal. The hypersurface orthogonality condition is rather strict and fix the\nextension in the infinitesimal region. Note that, in the timelike case, \u03b8 = \u2207a ka describes not the\narea expansion but the volume expansion rate. We introduce the coordinate vector ma = (\u2202/\u2202s)a\nwhose direction agrees with na at the point on the timelike surface where we evaluate the expansion\nrate. By straightforward computation[15], one may show that\n\u03b8 = \u03b8A + \u03b8m ,\nwhere \u03b8m denotes the expansion of the normal vector,\n\nd\nd\u03c4\n\n(17)\nln |m|. The timelike bulk hypersurface is\n\nfurther restricted by the initial condition\ns(0) \u2264 \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b8(0) ,\n4G\n\n(18)\n\nand the condition on the expansion of the vector ma\n\u03b8m (\u03c4 ) \u2265 0 .\n\n(19)\n\nWe shall call the resulting hypersurface as \"timelike sheet\". At first sight, the latter condition\nappears too restrictive. However, we note that the effect of tidal force in general makes size of\nbody grow when it is attracted toward a distribution of mass. This implies that \u03b8m is nonnegative\n7\n\n\frather generically for the geodesics of massive objects attracted toward the mass distribution. We\nshall give detailed examples of this elsewhere[15].\nNow the proposal is simple. The entropy passing through the timelike sheet should be constrained by the difference of the boundary area divided by 4G;\nST (B\u2212B \u2032 ) \u2264\n\n1\n(A \u2212 A\u2032 ) ,\n4G\n\n(20)\n\nwhere T (B \u2212 B \u2032 ) denotes the timelike sheet.\nFor the proof (valid in the classical regime), we shall use the local entropy condition\n\u0012\n\niii. \u1e61 \u2264 2\u03c0 Tab \u03be a \u03be b +\n\n1\nT\nD\u22122\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere dots represent derivatives with respect to \u03c4 and T = T aa . As in the lightlike case, the initial\ncondition (18) is not for the initial entropy flux but for the choice of the initial boundary surface.\nThe holography here is much stronger version than the previous ones, and implies the lightlike\nholography we discussed before. Namely if the holography is used for the timelike sheet that consists\nof almost lightlike geodesics, the lightlike holography follows as the limiting case. Therefore the\ntimelike holography needs a stronger requirement on the local entropy flux. Considering the almost\nlightlike geodesics, the expansion of the normal vector, \u03b8m , approaches zero and the condition (iii)\nimplies the condition (i).\nThe proof of the above in the classical regime is straightforward. The Raychaudhuri equation\nreads\n\n1\n1\n\u03b8 2 \u2212 \u03c3ab \u03c3 ab + \u03c9ab \u03c9 ab \u2212 8\u03c0G Tab \u03be a \u03be b +\nT ,\n(21)\nD\u22121\nD\u22122\nwhere we used the Einstein equation. Since geodesics are hypersurface orthogonal, the twist \u03c9ab is\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u2212\n\n\u0013\n\nzero automatically.\nAgain we note that the differential form of the holography,\ns \u2264 \u2212\n\n1\n1\n\u03b8 \u2264\u2212\n\u03b8A ,\n4G\n4G\n\n(22)\n\nimplies the integral version, where the second inequality follows from the condition (19).\nUsing (21) and the condition (iii), we have\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b82 +\n\u03c3ab \u03c3 ab + 2\u03c0 Tab ka kb +\nT\n\u03b8\u0307 =\n4G\n4G(D \u2212 1)\n4G\nD\u22122\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2265 \u1e61 .\n\n(23)\n\nTogether with the initial condition, one has\ns = s0 +\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c4\n\n1\nd\u03c4\u0303 \u1e61(\u03c4\u0303 ) \u2264 \u2212\n\u03b80 +\n4G\n\u0012\n\n8\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03c4\u0303 \u03b8\u0307(\u03c4\u0303 ) = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b8.\n4G\n\n(24)\n\n\fLike the case of the lightlike holography, so called spacelike projection theorem holds if certain\nconditions are met[7]. If the future directed timelike bulk hypersurface is complete i.e. B is the\nonly boundary, the entropy on the spacelike bulk enclosed by the boundary would be limited by\nthe boundary area divided by 4G. This is a consequence of the generalized second law. Therefore\nif any future directed timelike sheet is complete, the original 't Hooft version of the holographic\nprinciple follows.\nMain difference between the lightlike and the timelike holography lies in the form of the relevant\nenergy conditions. For the lightlike case, the null energy condition,\nTab ka kb \u2265 0\n\nfor all null ka ,\n\nis relevant. Let us consider a diagonalizable energy-momentum tensor that takes the form\nTab = \u03c1 ta tb +\n\nD\u22121\nX\n\n(i)\n\npi x(i)\na xb ,\n\n(25)\n\ni=1\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nwhere (ta , xa ) is an orthonormal basis with ta timelike and xa spacelike. Then the null energy\ncondition implies\n\u03c1 + pi \u2265 0 for i = 1, * * * , D \u2212 1 .\nOn the other hand, the energy condition related to the the timelike holography is the strong energy\ncondition\nTab \u03be a \u03be b +\n\n1\nT\nD\u22122\n\n\u2265\n\n0\n\nfor all timelike \u03be a .\n\nFor the above form of the energy momentum tensor, the strong energy condition implies\n(D \u2212 3)\u03c1 +\n\nX\n\npi \u2265 0 and \u03c1 + pi \u2265 0 for i = 1, * * * , D \u2212 1 .\n\ni\n\nIt is generically believed that, for any classically reasonable matter, the energy density Tab \u03be a \u03be b \u2265 0\nfor any timelike vector \u03be a . This energy condition is referred as weak energy condition. In term of\nthe energy density and momentum, the weak energy condition implies\n\u03c1 \u2265 0 and \u03c1 + pi \u2265 0 for i = 1, * * * , D \u2212 1 .\nThe strong energy condition is violated for the energy momentum tensor of positive cosmological\nconstant. Due to the relation \u03c1 = \u2212pi > 0, one of the strong energy condition is violated by\n(D \u2212 3)\u03c1 +\n\nP\n\ni pi\n\n= \u22122\u03c1 < 0.\n\nThe null energy or the strong energy conditions are not necessary conditions for the lightlike or\nthe timelike holography because the derivative of entropy flux density may be positive or negative.\n9\n\n\fT\n\nL\nR\n\nFigure 2: Here we consider the case where the timelike-sheet is complete such that the spacelike projection\ntheorem is applicable. The solid line at the bottom represents the spacelike region enclosed by some closed\nboundary. L and T are respectively for the lightsheet and the timelike-sheet.\n\nFinally let us illustrate one specific example in which the timelike holography leads to a stronger\nstatement than the lightlike holography. We take the case where the future-directed timelike sheet\nis complete before reaching singularity with the initial conditions on the expansion respected. (See\nFig. 2.) Using the lightlike and the timelike holography, one has SL \u2264\n\n1\n4G A\n\nand ST \u2264\n\n1\n4G A\n\nwith\n\nA being the boundary area. In addition, by the generalized second law, SL \u2264 ST . Thus, one gets\nSL \u2264 ST \u2264\n\n1\nA.\n4G\n\nThis is clearly a stronger statement than the one from the lightlike holography i.e. SL \u2264\n\n5\n\n1\n4G A.\n\nDiscussions\n\nIn this note, we propose a new version of holographic principle which compares the entropy passing\nthrough a bulk hypersurface consisting of timelike geodesics generated from a boundary surface to\nthe boundary area divided by 4G. We discuss the corresponding entropy condition closely related to\nthe Bekenstein bound as a generalization of the lightlike case. Based on the condition, we prove our\nproposal in the classical regime. It may be quite interesting to derive our timelike holography from\nthe lightlike holography of one higher dimensions via the dimensional reduction with a nonvanishing\nKaluza-Klein momentum.\nOur proposal is stronger than the lightlike case because the lightlike case can be obtained by\na limiting procedure in which the velocity field along the timelike geodesics approaches the light\nvelocity arbitrarily closely.\nOne may wonder whether further extension of the holography to the one based on spacelike\ngeodesics is possible or not. However the spacelike version, if possible, will lead to the 't Hooft\n10\n\n\fversion of holography for general backgrounds, for which we already gave the flat FRW universe as\na counterexample.\nThere are number of points to be studied further. Here we do not discuss about the possible\nquantum modification of the timelike holographic principle. In the lightlike case, an attempt is\nmade in Ref. [10]. The Raychaudhuri equation also plays an essential role for the proof of the\nsingularity theorem. As we discussed, the presence of singularity limits lightsheets and timelike\nsheets. Singularities seem to have some connections with the entropy of the system. In presence of\nthe cosmological singularities like the big bang, the meaning of the generalized second law is not\nquite clear. Namely the entropy of certain region may not have any operational meaning because\nthe part of the region may lie outside of the observer's particle horizon. Moreover, the notion of\ntime loses its meaning at the big bang or other singularities. Can we talk about then the fate of\ndegrees of freedom or entropy there? The holographic principle may shed some light on how to\ntackle the singularities.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Raphael Bousso and Naoki Sasakura for useful discussions and conversations.\nThis work is supported in part by KOSEF 1998 Interdisciplinary Research Grant 98-07-02-07-01-5.\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
