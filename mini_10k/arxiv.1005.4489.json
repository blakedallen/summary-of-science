A precise knowledge\nof cosmic distance to sources at moderate redshifts\n< few) is essential for success in this endeavor [1].\n(z \u223c\nIt has been suggested that gravitational radiation from\nmerging binaries (neutron star (NS)-NS, NS-black hole\n(BH), and BH-BH) could be a 'standard siren' and a\ncomplementary means (to standard candles and rulers)\nfor probing cosmic expansion [2\u20136]. Indeed, a knowledge\nof the underlying physics of gravitational radiation from\nbinaries could help establish the luminosity distance to a\nNS-NS binary to a precision of 2 per cent (ignoring, for\nthe time being, the redshift-dependent error from gravitational lensing). In order to serve as a cosmological\nprobe however, the luminosity distance should be known\nas a function of redshift. Therefore, unlike other probes\nof distance, the main systematic uncertainty in this case\nis the identification (and redshift determination) of galaxies hosting the binaries (see e.g. [4\u20136]) .\nThe space-borne gravitational wave observatory LISA\n[7] is expected to achieve an angular resolution of about\n1\u2032 (for a detailed discussion see [4]). The volume bounded\nby this angle (inclusive of the redshift uncertainty from\nluminosity distance errors) is expected to contain roughly\n30 objects at z \u2243 1.

Clearly, the larger\nthe number of galaxies within the observational beam,\nthe greater the chances for this to happen. Given the\nenormous potential of using gravity wave standard sirens\nto determine the nature of dark energy, it would clearly\nbe desirable to minimize this source of systematics. One\npossible approach rests in determining an association between merging binaries and the gas in the surrounding\nmedium. Unique signatures of an 'afterglow' from such\nan event in the electromagnetic spectrum could help in\nidentifying the source galaxy (e.g. [11]). Statistical determination of redshift using clustering properties of galaxies constitute another possible approach [12].\nIn this letter, we present a statistical iterative method\nto isolate the source of the GW signal. This formulation assumes no prior knowledge of the relation between\nthe luminosity distance and redshift (DZ relation). The\nmethod we propose can iteratively improve upon the errors on DZ relation. Our method is briefly summarized\nas follows: Beams containing a single galaxy with redshift consistent with the expected distance-redshift relation would accurately and reliably portray the DZ relationship. We shall call such sources 'gold plated' (GP)\nfollowing [10]. The expected number of such sources depends crucially on directional sensitivity. If more than\none galaxy falls within the beam we propose to rule out\nnon-sources through an iteratively improved DZ relation.\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: The maximum achievable accuracy on the DZ relation\nas a function of redshift using self-calibration for the BBO\ncase. The solid line corresponds to perfect pointing and the\ndashed curve is for the BBO pointing accuracy, where \u2206\u03a9BBO\nis taken from [10]. The other curves correspond to degrading\nthe pointing accuracy to 10\u2206\u03a9BBO , 50\u2206\u03a9BBO , 100\u2206\u03a9BBO ,\ncorresponding to curves with increasing values of \u03b4DL /DL .\nThe last two curves have a region in the middle where selfcalibration does not work since the required number of sources\nfrom Eq. (12) is larger than 3 \u00d7 105 . The BBO accuracy is\nalmost as good as the case for perfect pointing, with small\ndepartures at intermediate redshifts.\n\nIn our proposal we do not use other means of constraining\nthe DZ relation such as SN Ia, since SN Ia systematics\nis likely to be far more complex than previously thought\n[13]. Instead, we shall use GP sources to provide an independent approximate starting DZ relation which we iterate upon. To what precision this can be achieved depends\nupon the details of cosmology as well the experimental\nparameters. In this letter we investigate the efficacy as\nwell as limitations of this iterative self-calibration.\nRedshift Error-box: The directional accuracy of a GW\nsignal is determined by the experimental beam width\n\u2206\u03a9, giving rise to the possibility that several sources\nmight lie within the beam. To single out an object as\nthe unique source of the GW signal we either require a\nsmoking gun signal or a criterion by which other objects\nin the beam can be ruled out as possible sources. In\nthe presence of statistical uncertainty in DZ it is impossible to establish precisely the redshift z for a source of\ngravitational radiation. One must settle instead for an\nuncertainty z \u00b1 \u2206za where\n\u2206za \u2243\n\n\u03c3m (z)\u03a6(z)\n= \u03b7m \u03a6(z) ,\nDL\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a6(z) = (d log DL /dz)\u22121 and \u03c3m (z) is the redshift dependent standard deviation in the luminosity distance to\n\nFIG. 2: The minimum number of sources N0 required to selfcalibrate the DZ relation at a given redshift (see Eq. (12)) is\nshown as a function of the pointing accuracy \u2206\u03a9. The curves\n(right to left) correspond to z = 0.5, 1, 2. The value of N0\nrises steeply with the beam width since an increasing bin size,\n\u2206zbin , necessary to suppress cosmology errors, conflicts with\nthe requirement of unbiased calibration. (The latter cannot\nbe satisfied if most GW sources are associated with multiple\noptical counterparts in the pointing beam.)\n\na single source. The dimensionless standard deviation\n\u03b7m (z) = \u03c3m (z)/DL is partly due to instrumental noise\nand partly due to weak lensing. The dominant uncertainty is due to lensing and although lensing produces an\nasymmetric distribution of magnifications, for our purposes we shall assume that the distribution is described\nby a Gaussian with a dimensionless standard deviation\n\u03b7wl (z) = 0.042z, derived from the results of [14]. In this\npaper, we also add in quadrature a fixed value of instrumental noise \u03b7inst = 0.02 to the lensing standard devi2\n2\n2\nation to obtain \u03b7m\n= \u03b7wl\n+ \u03b7inst\n. \u2206za also contains an\nimportant cosmology-dependent contribution, so that the\nredshift error box is finally given by (see Appendix)\np\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\n2 (z) + \u03c3 2 (z)\n\u03c3m\n\u03b7c2 (z)\nc\n\u03a6(z) = \u03b7m (z)\u03a6(z) 1 + 2\n,\n\u2206za \u2243\nDL\n\u03b7m (z)\n(2)\nwhere \u03c3c (z) is the standard deviation in DZ reflecting\nuncertainty in our knowledge of the expansion history\nand \u03b7c = \u03c3c /DL .\nThough multiple objects might lie within the beam,\nit may still be possible, with a small enough value of\n\u2206za , to single out a source purely on statistical grounds.\nHowever, since measurement errors on a single source\nare fixed, the only way to lower the redshift error box\ngiven by Eq. (2), is by reducing the second term in that\nequation.\nOccupation Number: The redshift range \u2206za together\n\n\f3\nwith the beam width, \u2206\u03a9, determine the expected number of galaxies lying within the beam that are statistically\nconsistent both with the approximate DZ relation as well\nas the measurement uncertainty. In order to calculate\nthe occupation number n\u0304, defined as the mean number\nof galaxies that satisfy this criterion, we have adopted the\nnumber density of sources from [10, 15, 16]. The mean\nnumber of galaxies in the redshift range 2\u2206za turns out\nto be\nn\u0304(z) \u2243\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n8N\u03a9\n\u221a r(z) exp \u2212r4 (z) \u2206\u03a9\u2206za ,\nh(z) \u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we have assumed a small R\u2206za so the linear apz\nproximation suffices. Here r(z) = 0 dz/h(z) is the c/H0\nnormalized coordinate distance, h(z) = H(z)/H0 and\nN\u03a9 = 1000 arc min\u22122 is the projected number density\nof galaxies consistent with the Hubble Ultra Deep Field\n[17]. Substituting \u2206za from Eq. (2) we obtain\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n\u03b72\nn\u0304 = \u03bd(z) 1 + 2c\n,\n(4)\n\u03b7m\nwhere we have defined the minimum occupation number\n\u03bd(z) as the value of n\u0304 when \u03b7c = 0, namely\n\u03bd(z) =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n8\u03a6(z)N\u03a9\n\u221a r(z) exp \u2212r4 (z) \u03b7m \u2206\u03a9 .\nh(z) \u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nWe shall assume that galaxies falling within the beam\nare distributed uniformly randomly, however, at the end\nof this letter we briefly discuss how clustering of galaxies affects our analysis. Knowing the occupation number n\u0304, the probability that there be k galaxies, apart\nfrom the source galaxy, within the beam is given by\nPr(k) = n\u0304k exp(\u2212n\u0304)/k!. If there is only a single object in\nthe redshift error-box then we shall assume that it is the\nsource of the signal. The probability for such instances\nis given by Pr(0) = exp(\u2212n\u0304). Clearly the limiting fraction of sources that cannot be resolved statistically is\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bd(z)), which for \u03bd(z) \u226a 1 is approximately\ngiven by \u03bd(z).\nMethod: A GP source would measure the DZ relation with an accuracy \u03b7m at a redshift z. Let us consider a redshift bin, \u2206zbin , centered at the redshift z.\nThe total number of sources in this bin is given by\n\u2206N (z) = N0 f (z)\u2206zbin , where N0 is the total number of\nGW sources at all redshifts and f (z)\u2206zbin is the fraction\noccurring in the bin \u2206zbin . The value of N0 (NS-NS binaries) for GW space missions is expected to range from\nN0 \u223c 103 (LISA) to N0 \u223c 106 (BBO). Let us assume\nthat there are \u2206NGP (z) gold plated sources in the bin.\nThese sources furnish a first estimate of the DZ relation.\nSince each source has a measurement error given by \u03b7m\nthen clearly\np the zeroth error on cosmology is given by\n\u03b7c0 = \u03b7m / \u2206NGP (z).\nWe note that if there happen to be no GP sources\nin the redshift bin \u2206zbin then \u03b7c0 can be obtained by\nfitting a dark energy model to the GP sources at other\nredshifts. However, with no a priori reason to assume\n\na given behavior for dark energy, we advocate this selfconsistently obtained DZ relation where each redshift is\ndealt with independently.\nSince we now have the zeroth order information about\ncosmology we can p\nuse \u03b7c0 to calculate the occupation\n2 /\u03b7 2 . The zeroth knowledge\nnumber n\u03040 = \u03bd(z) 1 + \u03b7c0\nm\nof the DZ relationship resolves some sources to give the\nnew value of resolved sources (GP sample and statisti(1)\ncally resolved sources) as \u2206Nresolved = Pr(0)\u2206N (z) =\n\u2206N (z) exp(\u2212n\u03040 ), and thuspprovides us with a first improved estimate \u03b7c1 = \u03b7m / \u2206N (z) exp(\u2212n\u03040 ). With this\nrefinement in \u03b7c we can recalculate the occupation number at the first iteration as\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n1\nn\u03041 = \u03bd(z) 1 +\n.\n(6)\n\u2206N (z) exp(\u2212n\u03040 )\nIt is clear that iterating further we shall obtain the recurrence relation\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\n1\n.\n(7)\nn\u0304i+1 = \u03bd(z) 1 +\n\u2206N (z) exp(\u2212n\u0304i )\nThe iteration terminates when n\u0304i+1 = n\u0304i , and therefore\nthe saturation cosmological uncertainty, which is the second term inside parenthesis in the previous expression, is\ngiven by\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03b7c\n1\n=p\n,\n(8)\n\u03b7m s\nN0 f (z)\u2206zbin exp (\u2212n\u0304s )\nwhere we substituted for \u2206N (z) to explicitly show the\ndependence of the saturation occupation number on the\nbin size and the subscript s denotes saturation value.\nThe uncertainty decreases as \u2206zbin increases. However, since the bin size cannot be arbitrarily large, this\nratio has a lower bound, which we parameterize as\n\u03b7cmin /\u03b7m \u2261 min(\u03b7c /\u03b7m )s = \u01eb(z), where the minimum\nvalue is obtained by choosing the largest allowed bin\nsize. Thep\noccupation number in this case is given by\nn\u0304s = \u03bd(z) 1 + \u01eb2 (z), and using Eq. (8) it follows that\nthe bin size required to achieve this accuracy is given by\nh\ni\np\nexp \u03bd(z) 1 + \u01eb2 (z)\n\u2206zbin =\n.\n(9)\nN0 f (z)\u01eb2 (z)\n\nAveraging sources in the bin \u2206zbin introduces a systematic bias \u03b7csys in the DZ relation. If the bin size is\nsmall we can assume that the sources are distributed uniformly in the bin. By Taylor expanding the luminosity\ndistance DL , and taking its average over the bin we can\neasily obtain\n\u03b7csys =\n\n\u2032\u2032\nhDL (z0 )i \u2212 DL (z0 )\n1 DL\n\u2243\n\u2206z 2 ,\nDL\n24 DL bin\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is correct up to third order in \u2206zbin , and h i denotes\naveraging over the bin. If we demand \u03b7cmin = \u01eb(z)\u03b7m >\n\u03b7csys then we obtain\n\n\f4\n\n\u0012 \u2032\u2032 \u00131/5\n\u0015\np\nDL\n2\n1\n2\n\u01eb(z) exp \u2212 \u03bd(z) 1 + \u01eb (z) \u2265\n,\n2/5\n1/5\n1/5\n2/5\n5\nDL\n24 N0 f (z) \u03b7m\n\u0014\n\nwhere we have substituted \u2206zbin from Eq (9). This formula encapsulates our main result and determines the\nlimit of self-calibration.\nIn Fig 1 we plot \u03b4DL /DL = \u01eb(z)\u03b7m for BBO, assuming\nan equality in the above expression i.e. assuming that the\nsystematic term is equal to the random error. We have\ntaken a flat \u039bCDM model with \u03a9m = 0.3 for this figure.\nFor this plot we have taken N0 , f (z) and \u2206\u03a9BBO (z) from\n[10]. The same figure shows the accuracy obtainable for a\ndegraded beam by applying a constant multiplying factor\nto the BBO beam value.\nNecessary condition for self-calibration: The left hand\nside of Eq. (11) has a redshift dependent upper bound\nthat we denote as b(z). Self-calibration would work only\nif the left hand side is larger than the right hand side,\nleading to\nN0 >\n\n1\n1/2\n\n241/2 b5/2 (z)f (z)\u03b7m\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2032\u2032\nDL\nDL\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nIf this condition is not satisfied then the bin size required\nis too large and the systematic term would dominate\nthe random error. Therefore, in an experiment the total number of sources N0 should satisfy this inequality\nto self-calibrate at a given redshift. In Fig 2 we plot this\nfor a few redshifts as a function of \u2206\u03a9.\nGain factor: We now give a rough estimate of the number of sources resolved through this method. At a given\nredshift z a single source measures the luminosity distance at a fractional accuracy \u03b7m , which we can take as\nthe cosmological accuracy \u03b7c , leading to the\np occupation\n2 =\nnumber\nat\nthe\nbeginning\nto\nbe\nn\u0304\n=\n\u03bd(z)\n1 + \u03b7c2 /\u03b7m\n0\n\u221a\n2\u03bd(z). To obtain the resolved fraction at the end of iteration we shall consider the extreme case when N0 \u226b 1,\nwhich along with Eq (8) gives \u01ebs \u2243 0, therefore the saturation occupation number is n\u0304s \u2243 0.414 \u03bd(z). Since\nfor a given occupation number n\u0304, the fraction of total\nresolved sources is given by exp(\u2212n\u0304), it is clear that the\nratio of resolved sources at the end to that at the beginning (of iteration) is given by exp[0.414 \u03bd(z)]. Since\n\u03bd(z) is proportional to the pointing accuracy, the gain\nis an exponential function of the beam size. As an example, at z \u2243 1.75, for BBO the minimum occupation\nnumber \u03bd = 0.63 [19], giving a maximum gain factor of\n\u223c 1.3, while for DECIGO, assuming a beam linear size\nabout a factor three worse, the gain factor is about \u223c 11,\nshowing the extreme sensitivity of gain to the directional\nsensitivity.\nEffect of clustering: In the discussion so far we have neglected the impact of galaxy clustering. The effect of the\ngalaxy clustering can be taken into account by replacing\n\n(11)\n\nn\u0304 with\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\nn\u0304 1 +\n\u03bedV .\n\u2206V\n\n(13)\n\nHere \u2206V is the volume bounding the redshift and angular error-box (\u2206z and \u2206\u03a9) in the determination of the\nsource. \u03be is the two-point correlation function of galaxy\nclustering and the integral extends over \u2206V .\nHere we give estimates of the impact of clustering (second term of Eq. (13)) for BBO and DECIGO configurations at z \u2243 2. In the approximation, valid for these\ncases, in which the (comoving) linear size corresponding\nto angular resolution l\u22a5 is much smaller than the distance\ncorresponding to the radial distance lk of the (minimum\ni.e. when \u03b7c \u2192 0) redshift error, one can readily show\nthat\n\u0013\u22120.8 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nZ\nlk\n1\nl\u22a5\n\u2206n\u0304\n.\n=\n\u03bedV \u2243\nn\u0304\n\u2206V\n0.2 Mpc\n300 Mpc\n(14)\n\u2206n\u0304/n\u0304 \u2243 {1, 0.45} for the BBO and the DECIGO at\nz \u2243 2. Eq. (14) shows that this term scales inversely\nwith lk , and therefore the effect of clustering would be\nless important in the beginning of the iteration process\nwhen \u03b7c could be appreciable but would be increasingly\nimportant as the maximum achievable precision is approached.\nWe have shown that by iterating over a selfconsistently obtained DZ relation from resolved gravity\nwave sources it is possible to improve the luminosity distance (DZ) relation and therefore isolate those sources\nthat initially are unidentifiable (owing to multiple objects in the pointing beam).\nHowever, due to the fact that in this process only the\ncosmological errors are reduced, the limiting resolved set\ncrucially depends on the pointing accuracy at a given\nredshift. We have derived analytical expressions for the\nfinal accuracy reached on the DZ relationship as well as\nthe condition for successful self-calibration (Eq 12 and\nFigure 2). Our formulation will help future GW probes\ngrapple with the issue of redshift measurement uncertainty due to the presence of multiple objects within their\nbeam (Figure 1). A comprehensive analysis using simulated data to estimate cosmological constraints arising\nfrom future GW experiments will be presented in a companion paper.\nAppendix A\n\nWe now derive the probability distribution function\n(PDF) for the source redshift given a cosmological model\n\n\f5\nand a distance measurement to a GW source. We first\nderive the general formula and then specialize to the local\napproximation used in this paper.\nLet the measured distance be given by dm . To quantify\ncosmology errors we employ a linear model for the DZ\nrelation,\nDL (z, h) =\n\nN\nX\n\nh0 are the best fit parameters. We employ bold lower case\nletters to denote column matrices and bold capital letters\nto denote second rank matrices. Employing the Bayes\ntheorem we can write down the posterior probability for\nthe parameters of the model as\nP (z, h|dm ) \u221d P (dm |z, h)P (h)P (z) ,\n\nhi fi (z) = hT f ,\n\n(A1)\n\ni\n\nwhere h are the N parameters of the model, fi are N\narbitrary functions of redshift, and we have defined f =\n[f1 (z), f2 (z), . . . , fN (z)]. The unknown redshift is to be\ntreated as a parameter of the model. The simplest choice\nis fi = z i\u22121 , leading to a polynomial form for DL (z). The\nparameters h are not known precisely and are described\nby the Gaussian distribution\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1 T\nT\n\u22121\n\u221a\nP (h) =\nexp \u2212 (h \u2212 h0 )C (h \u2212 h0 )\n2\n(2\u03c0)N/2 det C\n(A2)\nwhere C is the covariance matrix, obtained by fitting the\nmodel to the resolved sources (or to other data sets), and\n\nP (z|dm ) \u221d\n\nZ\n\nwhere P (h) is the prior PDF for the parameters h given\nby Eq. A2, the prior P (z) is assumed to be flat, and\n#\n\"\n(dm \u2212 hT f )2\n1\n.\nexp \u2212\nP (dm |z, h) = \u221a\n2\n2\u03c3m\n2\u03c0\u03c3m\n\nwhich can be expressed through variables g = h\u2212 h0 and\n\u03c7 = dm \u2212 hT\n0 f as\n\n\u0015\n\u03c72 \u2212 2\u03c7gT f + gT Fg 1 T \u22121\nexp \u2212\n\u2212 g C g dN g ,\n2\n2\u03c3m\n2\n\nRecalling that \u03c7 = dm \u2212 hT\n0 f , we find that the redshift\nprobability distribution is centered at the redshift predicted for the distance dm by the best fit model d(z; h0 ).\nSince the functions f are redshift dependent, the precise\nbehavior of this function is complicated. P (z|dm ) can be\n\n(A4)\n\nThe PDF in Eq. A3 is a function of redshift z and h,\ntherefore the posterior PDF for the source redshift can\nbe obtained by integrating over h\nZ\nP (z|dm ) \u221d P (dm |z, h)P (h) dN h ,\n(A5)\n\n\u0014\n\nwhere the coefficients that do not contain z and g have\nbeen dropped, and we have defined a second rank matrix\n2\nF = f \u2297 f . If we define a matrix S = C\u22121 + F/\u03c3m\nthen\nthis equation takes the from\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1 T\n\u03c72 \u2212 2\u03c7gT f\n\u2212 g Sg dN g .\nP (z|dm ) \u221d exp \u2212\n2\n2\u03c3m\n2\n(A7)\nTranslating the coordinate system in the parameter space\n2\ng = u + u0 , where u0 is such that Su0 = \u03c7f /\u03c3m\n, we\nfinally obtain\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\nZ\n\u03c72\n\u03c7 T\n1\nT\n\u2212 2 + 2 u0 f \u2212 u Su dN u\nP (z|dm ) \u221d exp\n2\n\u03c3m\n\u03c3m\n(A8)\nCarrying out the integration and dropping all terms that\ndo not depend on the redshift we obtain\n!#\n\"\nf T S\u22121 f\n\u03c72\n(A9)\nP (z|dm ) \u221d det(S) exp \u2212 2 1 \u2212\n2\n2\u03c3m\n\u03c3m\n\n(A3)\n\n(A6)\n\nnormalized in the range z = 0 to z = zmax , and would,\nin general, produce an asymmetric distribution, due to\nthe manner in which the cosmological errors scale with\nredshift.\nLocal approximation: Since the PDF peaks at \u03c7 = 0,\nwe can define a redshift z0 through dm = hT\n0 f (z0 ). If the\ncosmology is determined precisely then we can assume\nthe redshift PDF to decline rapidly away from z0 , and\nT\nT \u2032\ntherefore we can replace hT\n0 f (z) = h0 f (z0 )+h0 f (z0 )(z \u2212\nT \u2032\nz0 ), implying \u03c7 = \u2212h0 f (z0 )(z \u2212 z0 ). Then, at the same\nlevel of accuracy we can replace f \u2261 f 0 = f (z0 ) in f T S\u22121 f .\n\u22121\nTo evaluate f T\nf 0 , we need an expression for S0 \u22121 .\n0 S0\nNoting that F0 is a rank one matrix, we have [18]\nS0 \u22121 = C \u2212\n\n1 CF0 C\n,\n2\n1 + g \u03c3m\n\n(A10)\n\n2\nwhere g = tr F0 C/\u03c3m\n.
