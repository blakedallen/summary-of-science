In a spin valve, one of\nthe magnetic layers, acting as a spin polarizer, is thick\nso that conducting electrons are polarized after passing through it. The polarized conducting electrons will\ntransfer their spin angular momentums to local magnetization of the thinner free magnetic layer, resulting in\nthe spin transfer torque (STT) effect first proposed by\nSlonczewski9 and Berger.10 Although the STT has many\nadvantages over a magnetic field in manipulating magnetization state,11,12 a large current density is needed to\nachieve a technologically useful magnetization switching\nspeed,13,14 but the associated Joule heating could affect\ndevice performance. Therefore, the current density reduction becomes a challenging issue from the spintronics\napplication viewpoint.15\nMany efforts have been devoted to the issue, including using optimized time-dependent current pulse,16 pure\nspin current,17 and thermal activation.18,19 One direct\napproach is to increase the magnitude of the STT under\na given current through unique geometry design. In 2003,\nBerger20 proposed a novel magnetic multilayer architecture called dual spin valve (DSV) where the free magnetic\nlayer is sandwiched between two thicker pinned magnetic\nlayers with opposite magnetizations. It is predicted that\nthe STT applied on the free magnetic layer should be\nmuch larger than that in a traditional spin valve for a\ngiven current in the diffusion regime.20 The argument\nis that spins accumulate at both non-magnetic/magnetic\ninterfaces of the free layer and STT is proportional to\nspin accumulations.20 However, it is not clear whether\nthis STT enhancement can occur in DSV in the ballistic\n\nregime without spin accumulations. Moreover, the analytical formalism for the STT in DSV is still an open\nproblem up to now.21,22 These are the focuses of present\npaper. A full-quantum description of the STT, valid\nwhen both the mean-free path and the spin-flip relaxation length are larger than the thickness of the spacers,\nis presented. Averaged (over electron phases) STT is obtained analytically within the Slonczewski's semiclassical\napproach9 when all magnetic layers are perfect polarizers. It is found that STT in DSV, depending on the\norientation of free layer and the degree of electron polarization, can be enhanced by a factor of tens in comparison\nwith that in a spin valve. The general cases of arbitrary\ntransmission and reflection coefficients of free layer are\nalso numerically calculated.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, a physical picture of STT origin in both spin valve and DSV\nis presented. Sec. III is the theoretical model and formulation of the electron transport through a DSV. The\nresults, including the analytical expression of the STT on\nthe free layer within the Slonczewski approach, are given\nin Sec. IV. Sec. V is the summary.\n\nII.\n\nPHYSICAL PICTURE\n\nIt shall be useful to present first a physical picture\nabout STT origin in spin valve and, in particular, its\nenhancement in DSV. Consider a spin valve, which is\nschematically shown in Fig. 1(a), consisting of a pinned\nferromagnetic layer FMA and a free ferromagnetic layer\nFMB separated by a nonmagnetic spacer NM. The magnetizations of FMA and FMB are represented by unit vectors, mA and mB , and their saturated magnetizations.\nFor the simplicity, we assume that both ferromagnetic\nlayers are perfect spin filters, such that spins aligned parallelly with the layer magnetization can completely transmit through the layer, while antiparallel spins are totally\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\nElectron flow\nFM A\n\nNM\n\nmA\n\n(b)\n\nmB\n\nElectron flow\nFM A\nNM A\n\nmA\n\nFM B\n\nmB\n\nEF0\n\nin Fig. 1(b). On the top of a usual spin valve (Fig.\n1(a)), an additional pinned ferromagnetic layer FMC\nwith an antiparallelly aligned magnetization to FMA , i.e.,\nmC = \u2212mA , is added so that the free layer FMB is\nnow sandwiched between FMA and FMC , separated by\ntwo nonmagnetic spacers NMA and NMB , respectively.\nSimilar to the case of a spin valve, right-going electrons\ntransmitting through FMA will exert a STT on FMB\nto align mB with mA , as shown by the blue arrow in\nFig. 1(b). After the electrons transmit through FMB ,\nmost of them will be reflected by FMC and then impinge\nagain on FMB , as shown by red-dashed symbols in Fig.\n1(b). Thus, they will exert another STT on FMB along\n\u2212mC = mA direction, resulting in the STT enhancement. Multiple reflections in region 2 (Fig. 1(c)) tend\nto reduce the torque but will not cancel it totally. In\nthe following sections we will verify this physical picture\nthrough a full-quantum mechanics calculation.\n\nFM B\n\n\u0219\n\nNM B\n\nFM C\n\nmC\n\n\u0219\n\nEF6\n\n(c)\nz\n\n\\ 1,L\n\n\\ 2,L \\ 3,L\n\n\\ 4,L \\ 5,L\n\n\\ 6,L\n\n\\ 1,R\n\n\\ 2,R \\ 3,R\n\n\\ 4,R \\ 5,R\n\n\\ 6,R\n\n0\ny\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nx\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Illustration of STT generated in\nspin valve.

In this ideal case, a closed analytical solution\nof the STT can be obtained, which will be shown later.\nConsider electrons flowing from the left to the right\nin Fig. 1(a). The right-going electrons are initially polarized along mA direction after passing through FMA .\nThey will remain their spin polarization when they impinge on FMB , as long as the spacer thickness is much\nshorter than the spin-diffusion length, which is usually\nthe case in nanoscale spin valves. Because the polarization direction of FMB is noncollinear with that of FMA ,\nan electron polarized along mA is the superposition of\ntwo states along mB and \u2212mB , so that the component\nalong mB can transmit through FMB while that along\n\u2212mB is totally reflected since FMB is a perfect polarizer.\nThus, there will be a net angular momentum transfer,\nperpendicular to mB , from impinged electrons to FMB ,\nresulting in a torque on FMB to align its magnetization\ntoward mA , as shown by the blue arrow in Fig. 1(a).\nThis is the origin of STT in spin valve. It should be\npointed out that the subsequent multiple reflections of\nelectrons within the NM spacer by the two FM/NM interfaces will reduce the STT, since the reflected electrons\n(dashed symbols in Fig. 1(a)) from FMB to FMA and\nback to FMB will exert a torque along \u2212mA . However,\nthe net torque will not be zero since the reflected electrons have smaller flux than that of the original injected\nelectrons.\nLet us now examine the spin transfer in a DSV shown\n\nIII.\n\nMODEL AND FORMULATION\n\nSingle charge and spin transport theory in magnetic\nmultilayers was well developed and approaches vary from\nclassical Valet-Fert theory in the diffusive regime,23 matrix Boltzmann equation formalism,24 to full-quantum\nmechanical treatments.9,25\u201330 In the present paper, we\nwill adopt a full-quantum mechanical description called\nscattering matrix method28\u201330 that is valid for ballistic transmission. We assume that interfaces are flat\nand clean and all spin-flip processes are negligible so\nthat momentum k is a good quantum number in each\nlayer.

The charge current density can also be written as\nje = e\n\n\u0127kx\nTe (z1 , z2 ) ,\nm\n\n(15)\n\nwith transmission coefficient\nTe (z1 , z2 ) =\n\nQ\u2193\u2191 (z1 , z2 )\n|D (z1 , z2 )|\n\n2\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nIn the case that electrons propagate ballistically\nthrough NMA and NMB , the phase shifts in normal metals are given by \u03c6A = kx lA and \u03c6B = kx lB where lA and\nlB are the widths of NMA and NMB , respectively. For\nsufficiently thick (much bigger than electron Fermi wave\nlength but still smaller than the spin diffusion length)\nNM layers, \u03c6A and \u03c6B vary rapidly from state to state.\nThus, when one sums up contributions from different\nelectronic states (different kx ), it is justifiable to assume\n\u03c6A and \u03c6B to be random,29 and z1 = exp (i2\u03c6A ) and\nz2 = exp (i2\u03c6B ) are equally distributed on the unit circle of the complex plane.28,29 However, one should note\nthat z1 and z2 are not independent under the ballistic asp\nsumption since z2 = (z1 ) with p = lB /lA .

The model parameters for (b-e) are obtained from Ref. 32, where they\nwere extracted from the first-principles calculations. All\ntransmission and reflection amplitudes are assumed to\nbe real. We find that the average total transmission approach zero as \u03b8 goes to 0 or \u03c0 even if td is finite for\nthe minority electrons, which is different from the result\n(Fig. 3 in Ref. 28) in traditional spin valve. The reasons are as follows. For \u03b8 = 0, all electrons are polarized\nalong mA after passing through FMB . They will be totally reflected by FMC because of mC = \u2212mA , leading\nto zero electric current. On the other hand, for \u03b8 = \u03c0, all\nelectrons that transmit FMA will be completely reflected\nby FMB if it is a perfect polarizer because electron spins\nare antiparallel to mB , while electrons passing through\nFMB will maintain polarization along mA in the case of\ntd 6= 0 and they will be totally reflected by FMC because\nof mC = \u2212mA . Hence, the average transmission in DSV\nvanishes at \u03b8 = 0 or \u03c0.\nThe total charge current flowing through the DSV can\nbe obtained by summing Eq. (15) over the transverse\nmomentum q. To find an analytical expression, we will\nadopt the semiclassical Slonczewski approach.9 Within\nthe Stoner description of magnetism and let \u2206 be the exchange energy of two spin bands of FMB , one can define\n\n\f5\ntwo Fermi wave vectors K+ and K\u2212 for majorities and\nminorities,\np\np\nK+ = 2mE/\u01272 , K\u2212 = 2m (E \u2212 \u2206) /\u01272 .\n(20)\n\nFor a ferromagnetic metal, we assume that the Fermi\nenergy lies above the exchange potential, and electrons\nin NMs are ideally matched with the majority electrons\nin FM, i.e., k = K+ . The possible momentum states\nthat contribute to the current can be divided into three\nranges.9,28\nRange a: 0 \u2264 q < K\u2212 .

(35)\n\nFirst of all, we can show a3 = 0 because of the\nparticle current conservation and the absence of spinflipping. This can be understood as follows: We first\nrotate \u1e91 to mB , then spinor state \u03c8n,\u03b1 = R\u0302 (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u03c8\u0303n,\u03b1\nwhere \u03c8\u0303n,\u03b1 is the electronic state seen along mB . Then,\n\u2020\neach spin density term \u03c8n,\u03b1\n\u03c33 \u03c8n,\u03b1 in Eq. (35) becomes\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03c3z \u03c8\u0303n,\u03b1 , so that spin\n\u03c8\u0303n,\u03b1 R\u0302 (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u03c33 R\u0302 (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u03c8\u0303n,\u03b1 = \u03c8\u0303n,\u03b1\nup state (parallel to mB ,) and spin down state (antiparallel to mB ) are decoupled without mixing. In the\nabsence of spin-flipping, both spin-up and spin-down particle currents are conserved. Thus, the STT projected\nalong local magnetization mB is zero. Here we have\nused identity R\u0302\u2020 (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u03c33 R\u0302 (\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03c3z . The physical consequence is that STT can only rotate the magnetization\nwithout change its magnitude.\nTherefore, the STT can be divided into an in-plane\n(Slonczewski) term9 \u03c4 k = a1 mB \u00d7 (mB \u00d7 mA ) and an\nout-of-plane (field-like) term33 \u03c4 \u22a5 = a2 mB \u00d7 mA . We\n\n\f6\nnote that the out-of-plane torque will vanish if tu , td , ru ,\nand rd are real. This is because all the spins of both\ntransmitted and reflected electrons are in the same plane\nspanned by mA and mB under the condition, and they\ncan only vary in this plane.\nParameters a1 and a2 are important to understand the\nspin dynamics in DSV.21,22 In Ref. 21, these parameters\nare chosen to vary continuously without geometry dependence, while they are calculated in the diffusice transport\nlimit in Ref. 22. To find a1 and a2 in our model, one\nneeds to compute quantities\nT\u03c3i (z1 ) =\n\n1 \u0010 \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nTr P\u03023,R \u03c3i P\u03023,R \u2212 P\u03023,L\n\u03c3i P\u03024,R\n\u03c3i P\u03023,L \u2212 P\u03024,R\n2\n\u0011\n\n\u2020\n+P\u03024,L\n\u03c3i P\u03024,L , (i = 1, 2) ,\n\n(36)\n\nsince ai = T\u03c3i (z1 ) (\u01272 kx )/m, (i = 1, 2).

Thus the average\nSTT on the free magnetic layer is\n\u0127\n\u0127\n\u0393 =g1 (\u03b8) Je mB \u00d7 (mB \u00d7 mA ) + g2 (\u03b8) Je mB \u00d7 mA ,\ne\ne\n(38)\nwith scalar functions\ngi (\u03b8) =\n\nhT\u03c3i i\n, (i = 1, 2) .\nJa /Jb + hTe i\n\n(39)\n\nThe STT \u0393 consists of two terms. The first one is Slonczewski torque \u0393k =g1 (\u03b8) \u0127e Je mB \u00d7(mB \u00d7 mA ) . And the\nsecond one is field-like torque \u0393\u22a5 =g2 (\u03b8) \u0127e Je mB \u00d7 mA .\nThe general analytical forms of g1 (\u03b8) and g2 (\u03b8) are\ndifficult to find because of the complicated residue calculations in Eqs. (18) and (37). However, they can be\nnumerically evaluated for any given material with definite material parameters tu , td , ru , and rd . In Fig. 3,\nwe present the numerical calculations of the magnitude\nof Slonczewski torque \u0393k = \u2212g1 (\u03b8) \u0127e Je sin \u03b8 per unit current versus angle \u03b8 at polarization coefficient P = 0.6\nunder three different conditions, which shows that different transmission probabilities have strong impact on\nthe torque and may change the sign of the torque. Similar sign reversal of STT is demonstrated in usual spin\nvalve.29\nHere, in order to directly compare our results in DSV\nwith Slonczewski's result in conventional spin valve,9 let\nus consider the case of ideal FMB , i.e., tu = 1 and\ntd = 0 (ru = 0, rd = 1). After some algebras, we obtain\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Slonczewski torque \u0393k versus \u03b8 for\npolarization P = 0.6 under three different conditions: (a)\ntu = 1 and td = 0; (b) |tu |2 = 0.99 and |td |2 = 0.1; and (c)\n|tu |2 = 0.84 and |td |2 = 0.17. The unit of torque is \u0127e Je .\n\nT\u03c31 = 41 (z1 + z1\u2217 \u2212 2) and T\u03c32 (z1 ) = \u2212 4i (z1 \u2212 z1\u2217 ). The\naveraged values are then\n1\nhT\u03c31 i (tu = 1, td = 0) = \u2212 ,\n2\nhT\u03c32 i (tu = 1, td = 0) = 0.\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nThus we get the scalar g\u2212functions\ng1 (\u03b8) =\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0001\n2,\n\u22123 + (1 + P ) / 2P 3/2 \u2212 (mA * mB )\n(42)\ng2 (\u03b8) = 0,\n(43)\n3\n\nwhich show that only the Slonczewski torque exists in\nthe ideal DSV. The absence of any layer-thickness dependence in Eq. (42) results from the phase average\nacross sufficiently thick normal metal layers. The values of g1 (\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0) are crucial to evaluate the threshold\ncurrent density Je\u2217 needed for magnetization reversal of\nthe free layer since Je\u2217 \u221d 1/g1 (\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0).16\nFigure 4 is the magnitude of STT per unit current as\na function of angle \u03b8 for various polarization P in ideal\nDSV. The STT is symmetric against \u03c0/2 due to the contributions from both fixed magnetic layers, which is different from the result in conventional spin valve.9,28,29\nFor polarization coefficient P < 1 it generally vanishes\nat \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0 (shown in Fig. 4). However, if P = 1,\nthe torque is singular at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03c0. The divergence can\nbe understood mathematically and from a physics viewpoint. Mathematically, the singularities at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03c0\n\u22122\nare due to the factor of g1 = \u2212 (sin \u03b8)\nwhen P = 1.\nPhysically this is the consequence of perfect spin filter.\nIn our model, every electron transfers its angular momentum to local magnetization when it impinges the interface\nof magnetic layer whose magnetization is not parallel to\nits spin.9 Meanwhile, the STT per unit current is defined\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Slonczewski torque \u0393k versus angle \u03b8\nfor various polarization P in the ideal case where all FMs are\nperfect polarizers. The unit of torque is \u0127e Je .\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Spin transfer torque enhancement ratio\ng1 (\u03b8) /g1\u2217 (\u03b8) versus \u03b8 for various polarization P in the ideal\ncase where all FMs are perfect polarizers.\n\nas the spin transfer per transmitted electron.9 However,\nin the case of \u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = \u03c0, perfect spin filter does not\nallow any electron transmitting through the DSV, which\nleads to a zero electron transmission and results in the\ndivergence. The above argument can also be applied to\nthe STT divergence at \u03b8 = \u03c0 in traditional spin valve\nin the original paper by Slonczewski.9 Nevertheless, we\nfind that the total STT \u0393 = \u2212 12 \u0127e Jb mB \u00d7 (mB \u00d7 mA ) if\nP = 1, does not have such singularities.\nFinally, we would like to compare the magnitude of\nSTT in our DSV with that obtained in traditional spin\nvalve.28 In Ref. 28, Krstaji\u0107 et al. calculated the\ng\u2212function in spin valve\n\nallel to parallel in DSV compared to that in conventional\nspin valve.\nFrom the qualitative physical picture and quantum\nmechanical calculations, we conclude that STT can be\ngreatly enhanced in DSV compared to that in spin\nvalve structure in the ballistic regime without spin accumulations. The findings of the physics behind and\nthe analytical formula of STT in this emerging geometry should be interesting for both theoretical21,22 and\nexperimental34,35 concerns. Micromagnetic simulation\nbased on our new g\u2212function (Eq. (42)) and LandauLifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation36 will be a direction of\nfuture research. The behavior of STT in asymmetric\nDSV when the widths of two NMs are different, i.e.,\nlA 6= lB , is also an interesting issue for further investigation.\nAlthough the advantage of STT enhancement is unambiguously demonstrated in our results, the accuracy\nof the analytical formula still needs experimental confirmation. We suggest to use a recently developed technique\ncalled spin-transfer-driven ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR)37 to measure the angular dependence of the STT\nin DSV.\n\ng1\u2217 (\u03b8) =\n\n3\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22124 + (1 + P ) (3 + mA * mB ) / 4P 3/2\n\n\u0001 , (44)\n\nwhich is the same as the Slonczewski's result in Ref. 9.\nWe plot the ratio g1 (\u03b8) /g1\u2217 (\u03b8) as a function of angle \u03b8\nfor various polarization P in Fig. 5. One can see that the\nSTT is largely enhanced when \u03b8 is acute, but approaches\nto that in usual spin valve when \u03b8 > \u03c0/2. Namely, the enhancement value sensitively depends on both the orientation of free layer and the polarization degree of electrons.\nUnder small tilted angle \u03b8 and large polarization P, the\nenhancement ratio is dramatic, which will substantially\nlower the required threshold current density for magnetization switching. For instance, g1 /g1\u2217 = 11.9 if \u03b8 = \u03c06\nand P = 0.8. While the enhancement ratio approaches\nto 1 (red dash line shown in Fig. 5) when \u03b8 is close to \u03c0.\nThe reason is that there is no difference between a DSV\nand a usual spin valve when layers FMA and FMB are antiparallelly aligned, since FMC would not reflect electrons\ncoming out of FMB in such case. The results are qualitatively consistent with Fuchs et al.'s experiment34 which\nshows that the reduction of threshold current switching\nFMB from parallel to antiparallel, with respect to FMA ,\nis substantial, while it is only of modest size from antipar-\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn conclusion, we derive the STT acting on the free\nmagnetic layer in a DSV structure in the ballistic regime.\nA full-quantum mechanics description of the STT is presented, which is valid for nanoscale DSVs where both\nthe electron mean-free path and the spin-flip relaxation\nlength are larger than the thickness of the spacers.38 Using a quasi-one-dimensional model and within the Slonczewski's approach, we obtained the analytical form of\nthe STT when all magnetic layers are perfect polarizers.\nSimilar to the results in the diffusive regime, the STT is\n\n\f8\ndramatically enhanced in comparison to that in a conventional spin valve although no spin accumulation exists at\nthe magnetic-nonmagnetic interfaces. Depending on the\norientation of free magnetic layer and the polarization\ndegree of electrons, the STT can be enhanced by a factor\nof a few tens. Our analytical g\u2212function provides a theoretical base for the micromagnetic simulation of the spin\ndynamics in DSV. The general cases when transmission\nand reflection probabilities of free layer are different from\nzero or one are also numerically calculated, which shows\nthat the sign of the torque may change under different\ntransmission probabilities. These results should be useful for the switching current reduction in magnetization\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nJ.A.
