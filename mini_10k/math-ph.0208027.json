Despite all the analogies with \"usual random\" models, tight binding operators for quasicrystals exhibit a feature which clearly distinguishes\nthem from the former: the integrated density of states may be discontinuous.\nThis phenomenon is identified as a local effect, due to occurrence of eigenfunctions with bounded support.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the present article we study the occurrence of discontinuities in the integrated\ndensity of states (IDS). For the special case of a tight binding model associated with\nthe Penrose tiling the occurrence of this effect has been known since quite some time\nas witnessed for example in [ATF, FATK, KF, KS]. We present two results. The\nfirst aims at showing that the occurrence of jumps in the IDS cannot be excluded\nby global assumptions concerning, e.g. ergodic or combinatorial properties. To\nthis end we present a theorem saying that starting from some model of aperiodic\norder (phrased in the language of Delone sets) one can construct a model that is\n\"basically the same\" and gives rise to a tight binding operator with a discontinuity\nin the IDS. Here \"basically the same\" is cast in the notion of \"mutually locally\nderivable\" for Delone dynamical systems. We discuss this notion analogous to the\nrespective notion for tilings found in [BSJ]. In the construction we use that the\nlaplacians on certain graphs have finitely supported eigenfunctions. It now becomes\nclear that it is the more complex structure of graphs in higher dimension that makes\nsuch a phenomenon possible. On lattices (and, consequently, in one-dimensional\nsystems) such finitely supported eigenfunctions cannot occur.\nOur second theorem says that this is the only possibility to create a jump of\nthe IDS, at least when starting from a reasonable Delone dynamical system. It is\na consequence of a rather strong ergodic theorem in [LS3]. This theorem states\nthat the IDS is in fact the uniform limit of eigenvalue counting distributions. It is\ntherefore substantially stronger than the weak convergence results typically proven\n* Research partly supported by the DFG in the priority program Quasicrystals.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. KLASSERT, D. LENZ AND P. STOLLMANN\n\nin connection with the IDS see for example [BLT, H, K]. The fact that such a\nstrong convergence holds true is special for models of aperiodic order and not met\nin usual random systems.\n2. Notation and results\nIn this section we introduce some notation and present our results. We will use\nthe same setting as the one found [LS2]. For completeness reasons we include the\nnecessary definitions.\nLet d \u2265 1 a fixed integer and all Delone sets, patterns etc. will be subsets of Rd .\nThe Euclidean norm on Rd will be denoted by k * k. For r \u2208 R+ and p \u2208 Rd , we let\nB(p, r) be the closed ball in Rd centered at p with radius r.\nA subset \u03c9 of Rd is called Delone set if there exist r(\u03c9) and R(\u03c9) > 0 such that\n2r(\u03c9) \u2264 kx \u2212 yk whenever x, y \u2208 \u03c9 with x 6= y, and B(x, R(\u03c9)) \u2229 \u03c9 6= \u2205 for all\nx \u2208 Rd .\nWe are dealing in this paper with local structures of Delone sets, therefore the\nrestrictions of \u03c9 to bounded subsets of Rd are of particular interest. In order to\ntreat these restrictions, we introduce the following definition.\nDefinition 2.1. (a) A pair (\u039b, Q) consisting of a bounded subset Q of Rd and\n\u039b \u2282 Q finite is called pattern. The set Q is called the support of the pattern.\n(b) A pattern (\u039b, Q) is called a ball pattern if Q = B(x, r) with x \u2208 \u039b for suitable\nx \u2208 Rd and r \u2208 (0, \u221e).\nThe diameter and the volume of a pattern are defined to be the diameter and\nthe volume of its support respectively.\nWe will have to identify patterns which are equal up to translation. More\nprecisely, on the set of patterns we introduce an equivalence relation by setting\n(\u039b1 , Q1 ) \u223c (\u039b2 , Q2 ) if and only if there exists a t \u2208 Rd with \u039b1 = \u039b2 + t and\nQ1 = Q2 + t. The class of a pattern (\u039b, Q) is then denoted by [(\u039b, Q)]. Obviously\nthe notions of diameter, volume occurrence etc. can easily be carried over from\npatterns to pattern classes.\nEvery Delone set \u03c9 gives rise to a set of pattern classes, P(\u03c9) = {Q \u2227 \u03c9 :\nQ \u2282 Rd bounded and measurable}, and to a set of ball pattern classes PB (\u03c9) =\n{[B(p, r) \u2227 \u03c9] : p \u2208 \u03c9, r \u2208 R+ }. Here we set Q \u2227 \u03c9 = (\u03c9 \u2229 Q, Q). We define the\nradius s = s(P ) of an arbitrary ball pattern P to be the radius of the underlying\ns\nball. For s \u2208 (0, \u221e), we denote by PB\n(\u03c9) the set of ball patterns with radius s. A\nDelone set is said to be of finite type or of finite local complexity if for every radius\ns\ns > 0 the set PB\n(\u03c9) is finite.\nThe Hausdorff metric on the set of compact subsets of Rd induces the so called\nnatural topology on the set of closed subsets of Rd . It is described in detail in [LS2]\nand shares some nice properties: firstly, the set of all closed subsets of Rd is compact\nin the natural topology. Secondly, and this is of prime importance in view of the\ndynamical system we are to consider, the natural action T of Rd on the closed sets\nin Rd given by Tt G = G + t is continuous.\nFurthermore, a Delone dynamical system (DDS) consists of a set \u03a9 of Delone\nsets, which is invariant under the shift T and closed in the natural topology. A DDS\nis said to be of finite type (DDSF) if \u222a\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 PBs (\u03c9) is finite for every s and the set\nP(\u03a9) of patterns classes associated to a DDS \u03a9 is defined by P(\u03a9) = \u222a\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 P(\u03c9).\nDue to the compactness of the set of all closed sets in the natural topology a DDS\n\n\fDISCONTINUITIES OF THE INTEGRATED DENSITY OF STATES\n\n3\n\n\u03a9 is compact. We refrain from a precise discussion of the topology but we give the\nfollowing Lemma from [LS2].\nLemma 2.2. If (\u03a9, T ) is a DDSF then a sequence (\u03c9k ) converges to \u03c9 in the\nnatural topology if and only if there exists a sequence (tk ) converging to 0 such that\nfor every L > 0 there is an k0 \u2208 N with (\u03c9k + tk ) \u2229 B(0, L) = \u03c9 \u2229 B(0, L) for\nk \u2265 k0 .\nRoughly speaking, \u03c9 is close to \u03c9\u0303 if \u03c9 equals \u03c9\u0303 on a large ball up to a small\ntranslation. We now recall some standard notions from the theory of dynamical\nsystems and some available equivalent \"combinatorial\" characterizations.\nA dynamical system (\u03a9, T ) is called minimal if the orbit {Tt \u03c9 : t \u2208 Rd } of any\n\u03c9 is dense in \u03a9. For a DDS this is equivalent to the property that P(\u03a9) = P(\u03c9)\nfor any \u03c9. This latter property is called local isomorphism property in the tiling\nframework; see [Sol1]. A sequence (Qk ) of subsets in Rd is called a van Hove\nsequence if the sequence |\u2202 R Qk ||Qk |\u22121 tends to zero for every R \u2208 (0, \u221e). Here,\n\u2202 R Q denotes the set of those x \u2208 Rd whose distance to the boundary of Q is\nless than R. Furthermore, a dynamical system (\u03a9, T ) is called uniquely ergodic\nif it admits only one T -invariant measure (up to normalization). For a Delone\ndynamical system, this is equivalent to the fact, that for every nonempty pattern\nclass P the frequency\n\u03bd(P ) \u2261 lim |Qk |\u22121 \u266fP (Qk \u2227 \u03c9),\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nexists uniformly in \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 for every van Hove sequence (Qk ). We call a dynamical\nsystem (\u03a9, T ) strictly ergodic if it is minimal and uniquely ergodic. Note that in\nthis case the frequency \u03bd(P ) is positive for every P \u2208 P\nDefinition 2.3. Let (\u03a9, T ) be a DDSF. A family (A\u03c9 ) of bounded operators A\u03c9 :\nl2 (\u03c9) \u2212\u2192 l2 (\u03c9) is called a random operator of finite range if there exists a constant\nrA with\n\u2022 A\u03c9 (x, y) = 0 whenever kx \u2212 yk \u2265 rA .\n\u2022 A\u03c9 (x, y) only depends on the pattern class (B(x, rA ) \u222a B(y, rA )) \u2227 \u03c9.\nNote that the above defined operators provide a framework including Laplace\ntype operators defined on l2 (Zd ). Let us mention, that for \u03c9\u0303, \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 the operators act on different Hilbert spaces l2 (\u03c9) and l2 (\u03c9\u0303) unless \u03c9 and \u03c9\u0303 differ only by\ntranslation. Thus, to deal with operators on l2 (\u03c9) is more complicated than in the\nlattice case.\nThe aim of this article is to discuss the phenomenon of discontinuities of the\nintegrated density of states of random operators (A\u03c9 ) on a DDSF (\u03a9, T ). This\nmight rather come as a surprise in view of what is known for random models as\nwell one dimensional quasicrystals. It turns out that this phenomenon occurs if\nand only if there exist locally supported eigenfunctions of (A\u03c9 ). One can find\nexamples of locally supported eigenfunctions on the Penrose tiling in [KS] and\n[ATF]. An eigenfunction f is said to be locally supported if suppf \u2282 K, with\nK a compact set. The phenomenon of locally supported eigenfunctions is by no\nmeans pathological. Rather from any given DDSF (\u03a9, T ) we can construct an in\nsome sense local equivalent DDSF (\u03a9b , T ) such that a random operator of finite\nrange (Ab\u03c9 ) defined on (\u03a9b , T ) has locally supported eigenfunctions. More precise:\n(\u03a9, T ) and (\u03a9b , T ) are mutually locally derivable (MLD). The equivalence concept\n\n\f4\n\nS. KLASSERT, D. LENZ AND P. STOLLMANN\n\nof mutual local derivability for tilings was discussed in detail in [BSJ]. This will all\nbe discussed below. Our first result reads as follows.\nTheorem 1. Let (\u03a9, T ) be a arbitrary DDSF. Then there exists a DDFS (\u03a9b , T )\nand a random operator of finite range (Abw ) such that (\u03a9, T ) and (\u03a9b , T ) are mutually locally derivable and (Abw ) has locally supported eigenfunctions with eigenvalue\nE for every \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9b . Moreover, (Abw ) can be chosen to be the nearest neighbor\nlaplacian of suitable graph.\nNote that for a selfadjoint random operator A and bounded Q \u2282 Rd the restriction A\u03c9 |Q defined on l2 (Q \u2229 \u03c9) has finite rank. Therefore, the spectral counting\nfunction\nn(A\u03c9 , Q)(E) := #{ eigenvalues of A\u03c9 |Q below E}\nis finite and\nby\n\n1\n|Q| n(A\u03c9 , Q)\n\n\u03c9\nis the distribution function of the measure \u03c1A\nQ , defined\n\n1\ntr(\u03c6(A\u03c9 |Q )) for \u03c6 \u2208 Cb (R).\n|Q|\n\u03c9\nOn a uniquely ergodic DDSF the measures \u03c1A\nQk converge in distribution to a\nmeasure \u03c1A , called the integrated density of states (IDS) for any van Hove sequence Qk as k \u2192 \u221e. This is described in [LS2, LS3]. There one can also find an\ninterpretation of the IDS as a certain trace on a von Neumann algebra. Now, we\ncan state our main theorem.\n\u03c9\nh\u03c1A\nQ , \u03c6i :=\n\nTheorem 2. Let (\u03a9, T ) be a strictly ergodic DDSF. Let A be a selfajoint random\noperator of finite range. Then E is a point of discontinuity of \u03c1A if and only if\nthere exists a locally supported eigenfunction of A\u03c9 to E for one (all) \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9.\nRemarks 2.4. (1) It rather straightforward to see that locally supported eigenfunctions lead to a discontinuity of the IDS. The more interesting part of the\nequivalence is discontinuities only happen in that way.\n(2) The theorem holds also in the tiling setting. Here a single tile of the original\ntiling will be replaced by 9 tiles of a new tiling which is MLD to the originally\ngiven one.\n(3) As pointed out already the theorem gives rise to a complete characterization\nof the phenomenon of locally supported eigenfunctions in quasicrystal settings\n(i.e. DDSF an tiling settings).\n(4) Let us emphasize that the integrated density of states is continuous in the\ncase of almost periodic and random operators on lattices. Due to the more\ncomplex geometry this does not follow in the quasicrystal framework.\n3. Preliminaries\nIn this section we will study the equivalence concept of MLD. Further we are\ngoing to construct a map, which maps any given DDSF to a DDSF which is MLD\nto the given one and where a random operator exists who has locally supported\neigenfunctions. As well we state some tools which will be used later on to prove\nour results.\nAs mentioned already the equivalence concept of MLD for patterns on tilings was\ndiscussed in [BSJ]. We give the obvious definition for Delone dynamical systems of\nfinite type.\n\n\fDISCONTINUITIES OF THE INTEGRATED DENSITY OF STATES\n\n5\n\nDefinition 3.1. Let (\u03a9, T ) and (\u03a9b , T ) a DDSF. A map D : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9b is called\na local derivation map if there exists a radius rD > 0 such that D(\u03c9) \u2229 {x} =\n(t + D(\u03c9)) \u2229 {x} holds whenever \u03c9 \u2229 B(x, rD ) = (t + \u03c9) \u2229 B(x, rD ). In this case\n(\u03a9b , T ) is called locally derivable from (\u03a9, T ). Two DDSF (\u03a9, T ) and (\u03a9b , T ) are\nmutually locally derivable if (\u03a9, T ) is locally derivable from (\u03a9b , T ) and vice versa\n\u2032\n(with a possibly different radius rD\n).\nNote that the map D is local in the sense that D(\u03c9) \u2229 B(x, s) only depends on\n\u03c9 \u2229 B(x, s + 2rD ).\nProposition 3.2. Let (\u03a9, T ) be a DDSF, D : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9b , \u03c9 7\u2192 D(\u03c9) a local derivation\nmap. Then D is continuous with respect to the natural topology.\nProof. This is immediate as D is local and the topology is local in the sense of\nLemma 2.2.\nWhat we want to do now is to put a well scaled local structure in a given Delone\nset whenever a certain pattern occurs. Let \u03c9 be a Delone set and P be a ball\npattern class with P \u2208 P. Then, we define \u03c9P to be the set of all occurrences of P\nin Rd , i.e.\n\u03c9P \u2261 {t \u2208 Rd : B(t, s(P )) \u2227 \u03c9 = P }.\n\n(1)\n\nNow, let (\u03a9, T ) be a DDSF and r < r(\u03c9) for all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, G be a finite graph with\nr\nVG the set of vertices of G contained in Rd . Furthermore let diam(G) = 21\nand\nr\nVG \u2282 B(0, 42 ). We use this finite graph to define a local derivation map by setting\nDP,VG (\u03c9) \u2261 \u03c9 \u222a {t + VG : t \u2208 \u03c9P } for \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 and \u03a9b := {DP,VG (\u03c9) : \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9}. Then,\nDP,VG : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9b ,\n\n\u03c9 7\u2192 DP,VG (\u03c9)\n\nis a local derivation with inverse given by the local derivation map\nHP,VG : \u03a9b \u2192 \u03a9,\n\nHP,VG (\u03c9 b ) = {x \u2208 \u03c9 b : \u03c9 b \u2229 B(x, r3 ) = \u03c9 b \u2229 B(x,\n\nr\n42 )}.\nb\n\nNote that (\u03a9, T ) is also a local derivation of (\u03a9b , T ). Thus, (\u03a9, T ) and (\u03a9 , T ) are\nmutually locally derivable.\nRemarks 3.3. Let \u03a9 and \u03a9b be as above. Then\n(1) If (\u03a9, T ) is a DDSF then (\u03a9b , T ) is a DDSF as well.\n(2) If (\u03a9, T ) is a uniquely ergodic DDSF, the same holds for (\u03a9b , T ).\n(3) The frequency of G in \u03a9b is the same as the frequency \u03bd(P ) of P in \u03a9.\nThe following two ingredients are essential for the proof of Theorem 2. The\nfirst one is one of the main results from [LS3]. It relies on a strong ergodic type\ntheorem proven there (see [Len] for a study of uniform ergodic theorems in the one\ndimensional case).\nTheorem 3.4. Let (\u03a9, T ) be an aperiodic strictly ergodic DDSF. Let A be a selfadjoint operator of finite type and (Qk ) be a van Hove sequence in Rd . Then, the\n\u03c9\ndistribution functions of \u03c1A\nQk converge uniformly to the distribution function of the\nmeasure \u03c1A and this convergence is uniform in \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9.\nThe second one is a well known dimension argument from linear algebra which\nwe will state for completeness reasons.\nProposition 3.5. Let H be a finite dimensional Hilbert space, U, V subspaces of\nH with dim U > dim V then dim V \u22a5 \u2229 U > 0.\n\n\f6\n\nS. KLASSERT, D. LENZ AND P. STOLLMANN\n\n4. Proofs\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.\nProof of Theorem 1. To prove the theorem we start with the construction of a\nDDSF where a random operator of finite range (A\u03c9 ) exists which has locally supported eigenfunctions. The starting point is a small graph Gf in = (Vf in , Ef in ) and\nan eigenfunction uf in of the associated nearest neighbor laplacian. For definiteness\nsake consider Figure 1. The values of uf in are indicated near the corresponding\nvertices. Here the eigenvalue is E = 0.\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFigure 1. The finite graph Gf in .\nIt is clear that whatever edges reach out of the four corners in a larger graph\nextending Gf in , the extension of uf in by 0 to the larger vertex set will still constitute\nan eigenfunction of the laplacian on the large graph. It is now easy to implement\nthis picture into a given DDSF. In fact, let (\u03a9, T ) be a DDSF and P be a ball\npattern. We use the local derivation map DP,Vf in discussed in the last section to\nput in Vf in from above, scaled properly, whenever P appears. It is obvious by\nthe definition of DP,Vf in , that this gives rise to a DDSF (\u03a9b , T ) which is locally\nderivable from (\u03a9, T ) and vice versa.\nObviously we get a random operator Ab with locally supported eigenfunctions\nby taking for Ab\u03c9 the nearest neighbor laplacian on the copies of Ef in in \u03c9 and\nconsistent matrix elements otherwise.\n\nRemarks 4.1. (1) The simplest case of the construction made above is of course\ngiven by choosing P = ({x}, B(x, r)) with r < r(\u03c9). Then the graph Gf in is\nglued at any point of the underlying Delone set. The corresponding l2 space\nis just a direct sum (or tensor product) and that applies to the operators as\n\n\fDISCONTINUITIES OF THE INTEGRATED DENSITY OF STATES\n\n7\n\nwell. Related constructions have been considered by [SA] in the context of\ncreation of spectral gaps.\n(2) For those who prefer tiling examples we now indicate how to view the construction above in this framework. Take a tiling dynamical system (see\n[LS2, Sol2]) and replace one given tile T by a suitable homeomorphic image\nof T b indicated in Figure 2. We also indicated the next neighbor relations,\nshowing that the resulting graph is just Gf in above.\n\nFigure 2. The tiling of Gf in .\nProof of Theorem 2. We first show that the condition is sufficient. Let u be\nan eigenfunction of A\u03c90 associated to an eigenvalue E with supp u \u2282 B(x, r) and\nx \u2208 \u03c90 . Then for any \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 every copy of P = B(x, r) \u2227 \u03c90 in Q \u2227 \u03c9 adds a\ndimension to the eigenspace of A\u03c9 |Q belonging to the eigenvalue E. Let \u266f \u0307 P Q \u2227 \u03c9\n=: C\nbe the maximal number of disjoint copies of P in Q\u2227\u03c9. Note that |B(0,3r+r(\u03c9))|\n|B(0,r(\u03c9))|\nis a upper bound for the number of points (and therefore the maximal number of\ncopies of P ) in B(0, 3r) \u2229 \u03c9.\nThis gives by a direct combinatorial argument that\n1\n\u266f \u0307 P Q \u2227 \u03c9 \u2265 \u266fP Q \u2227 \u03c9.\nC\nThus, for arbitrary \u01eb > 0\ntr(\u03c7(\u2212\u221e,E+\u01eb) (A\u03c9 |Q )\ntr(\u03c7(\u2212\u221e,E\u2212\u01eb) (A\u03c9 |Q )\n1 \u266fP \u03c9 \u2227 Q\n\u2264\n\u2212\n.\n|Q|\n|Q|\nC |Q|\nSetting Q = Qk with Qk from a van Hove sequence and letting k tend to infinity,\n)\nwe get that \u03c1A (E \u2212 \u01eb) \u2264 \u03c1A (E + \u01eb) \u2212 \u03bd(P\nC . As \u01eb > 0 is arbitrary and \u03bd(P ) > 0 the\ndesired implication follows.\n\n\f8\n\nS. KLASSERT, D. LENZ AND P. STOLLMANN\n\nNext we show the converse implication. Let \u1ebc be a point of discontinuity of the\nfunction E 7\u2192 \u03c1A ((\u2212\u221e, E]) and (Qk ) an arbitrary van Hove sequence. We consider\n1\n\u03c9\nn(A\u03c9 , Q) of the measure \u03c1A\nthe distribution function |Q|\nQk . Proposition 3.4 shows,\n1\nthat |Qk | n(A\u03c9 , Qk ) converges w.r.t. the supremum norm to the function E 7\u2192\n\u03c1A ((\u2212\u221e, E]). Thus, for large k the jump at \u1ebc of the function |Q1k | n(A\u03c9 , Qk )(E)\ndoes not become small. More precisely we get\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndim ker (A\u03c9 |Qk \u2212 \u1ebc) = lim (n(A\u03c9 , Qk )(\u1ebc + \u01eb) \u2212 n(A\u03c9 , Qk )(\u1ebc \u2212 \u01eb)) \u2265 c|Qk |\n\u01eb\u21920\n\nfor a c > 0 and all k \u2208 N. Now let \u22022rA Qk \u2261 \u2202 2rA Qk \u2229 Qk denote the inner\nboundary of range 2rA of Qk . For a van Hove sequence (Qk ) we have\ndim l2 (\u22022rA Qk )\n\n= \u266f{x \u2208 Rd : x \u2208 \u22022rA Qk \u2229 \u03c9}\n|\u22022rA +r(\u03c9) Qk |\n\u2264\n|B(0, r(\u03c9))|\n1\n* |Qk |\n= \u01ebk *\n|B(0, r(\u03c9))|\nwith a suitable \u01ebk which tends to 0 for k \u2192 \u221e. For k large enough we get that\n1\n. Thus, for large k the inequality\nc > \u01ebk * |B(0,r(\u03c9))|\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndim ker (A\u03c9 |Qk \u2212 \u1ebc) > dim l2 (\u22022rA Qk ).\nholds. Now let Wk the projection onto the inner boundary of range 2rA of Qk .\nThen Propositon 3.5 shows that there exists an eigenfunction f of A\u03c9 such that\nWk f = 0 for k large enough.\nRemark 4.2. Let the conditions be as above. Then E is an infinitely degenerate\neigenvalue of A\u03c9 for every \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. The integrated density of states has a jump at\nE whose height is at least C \u22121 \u03bd(P ).\nAcknowledgements: The authors would like to thank Uwe Grimm for helpful\ncomments on the physics literature.\nReferences\n[ATF]\n\nM.
