This formulation leads to the FCS without the need for the usual\nnon-equilibrium (Keldysh) transport theory or the direct computation of the determinant of an\ninfinite-dimensional matrix. In the particular case of the application of N Lorentzian pulses, we\nshow the computation of the FCS reduces to the diagonalization of an N \u00d7 N matrix. We also use\nthe formulation to compute the core-hole response in the X-ray edge problem and the FCS for a\nsquare wave pulse-train for the case of low transmission.\n\nThe experimental and technological importance of a\nfull quantum mechanical treatment of the response of\nFermi systems to a time-dependent perturbation, has\ngrown as electronic devices have shrunk. In particular,\nthe quantum statistics of charge transfer events induced\nby an applied voltage pulse in simple systems such as\nacross a tunneling barrier or along a wire need to be\nunderstood if the limits to their capacity to encode or\ntransmit information are to be found [1, 2]. They are\nalso excellent examples of non-equilibrium systems for\nwhich in some cases complete theoretical treatments are\nknown or are feasible.\nTheoretically, interest has concentrated on the full\ncounting statistics (FCS) or generating function, \u03c7(\u03bb),\nfor all moments of the charge distribution [3]. There\nare results for the case of an infinite train of periodic\npulses impinging on a tunneling barrier [4, 5, 6] and, for\nthe case of a low transparency barrier with a constant\nbias voltage V , the FCS are also known for non-zero\ntemperatures [2]. Particular attention has been paid to\ntheRcase of Lorentzian voltage pulses with 'integer area'\n\u221e\n( he \u2212\u221e V (t)dt is an integer). If the voltage pulses all\nhave the same polarity they generate so-called 'Minimal\nexcitation states' (MES). These have been shown to minimise the number of excitations in a one-channel Fermi\ngas required to generate a given signal. They have the\nintriguing property that a train of such pulses retain the\nminimal noise property [4, 7] independent of the separation or width of the generating voltage pulses provided\nthe pulses are all of the same polarity. When such signals\nimpinge on a tunneling barrier their nature is reflected\nin the FCS [4].\nHere we show that the FCS at zero temperature are\ndetermined solely by the geometry of two planes. For a\ntrain of N Lorentzian pulses these two planes coincide\nexcept in an N -dimensional subspace. Computing the\nFCS in this case reduces to the diagonalization of N \u00d7 N\nmatrix, which we compute explicitly. The known results\nfor \u03c7(\u03bb) follow directly from this geometric formulation\ncircumventing the need to work with a formulation using Keldysh Green's functions [6] or solving an auxiliary\nRiemann-Hilbert problem to invert singular operators [5].\n\nz\ny\nx\n\u03b1\n2\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) The geometry of the FCS. In the space\nof single-particle states, orbitals occupied at zero temperature\ncorrespond to eigenstates of h with eigenvalue 1 and define a\nmirror plane shown schematically as the x\u2212axis. Unoccupied\nstates at zero temperature (with eigenvalue \u22121) are in the\ncomplement of plane, one of these is the y-axis and the remainder are shown as the z-axis. In the insets the dashed line\ndivides states into those above and below the unperturbed\nFermi level but no other ordering by energy is implied. Application of a voltage pulse, biasing one electrode with respect\nto the other, transforms h \u2192 e\nh = U hU \u2020 . Case (a): (Nu = 1,\nNb = 0 see text) The corresponding plane has an added dimension and is shown as the shaded plane. Case (b): (Nu = 0,\nNb = 1) The plane rotates by \u03b1/2 about an axis perpendicular to h. The axis of rotation and the new occupied state are\nfound from [h, e\u2212i\u03c6(t) ] (see text). All other states are rotated\nas a function of time but remain eigenstates of both h and e\nh.\n\nThe mirror planes are defined by the operators h =\n2n \u2212 1 and h\u0303 = U hU \u2020 , where n is the ground state density matrix and U is the unitary operator which describes\nthe effect of applying a voltage pulse between different\ncomponents of the sytem. Directions corresponding to\noccupied single-particle states are in the corresponding\nmirror plane (eigenvalue +1) while directions corresponding to unoccupied states are in its complement and reflected (eigenvalue \u22121). The planes have the dimension\nof the number of occupied single-particle states. The\nintersection of the two planes (and the intersection of\nthe two complements) define the states which are occupied (or unoccupied) in both the initial and transformed\nstates and which therefore contribute nothing to the FCS.\nThe remaining states are rotated with respect to one an-\n\n\f2\nother by angles which we denote by \u03b12k . The directions\nwhich are rotated can be identified from the commutator\n[h, e\u2212i\u03c6(t) ], which defines a spanning set of states for the\nrotated space.\nWe consider as a model system a quantum point contact between two ideal single channel conductors coupled\nby a tunneling barrier localised around x = 0 and treat\nthe effect of a voltage pulse, V (t), applied between the\ntwo conductors (see Figure 1). We assume that we can\nneglect the contributions to the noise and other moments\nof the distribution of transferred electrons which scale as\nlog t0 \u03be where t0 is the observation time and \u03be is an ultraviolet cutoff set by the Fermi energy. These are present\neven in equilibrium and are associated with the fact that\nthe charge number in the left or right electrode is not a\nconserved quantity [3]. The FCS of transmitted charge\nacross the point contact (which we take to have reflection\nand transmission probabilities R and T = 1 \u2212 R) can be\nobtained from the generating function\n\u03c7(\u03bb) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nPn ei\u03bbn\n\n(1)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere Pn is the probability of n particles being transmitted (from the left electrode to the right one).\nThe principle result of [6] is that\n\u03c7(\u03bb) = (R + T ei\u03bal \u03bb )Nu\nNb \u0010\n\u0011\nY\n\u03b1\n1 + RT sin2 (ei\u03bb + e\u2212i\u03bb \u2212 2) , (2)\n2\n1\nwhere Nu is the number of unidirectional events with\n\u03bal = \u00b11 determined by the polarity of the voltage pulse\nand Nb the number of bidirectional events. The geometry for the two types of event is illustrated in Figure 1.\nConsider first the case of a simplified system consisting of\na single state on either side of the barrier. Suppose now\nthat, after taking account of the voltage pulse, the state\non the left side is occupied and empty on the right. This\nis an example of a single MES [7] or unidirectional [6]\nevent and is the case illustrated in Fig 1(a): the h-plane\n(shown as the x\u2212axis) is actually zero-dimensional for\nthis simplified one-state system and the e\nh plane is onedimensional. The FCS for this situation is clearly given\nby \u03c7(\u03bb) = R + T ei\u03bb : P0 = R and P1 = T in (1).\nThe bidirectional event is illustrated in Fig 1(b).\nAgain consider first the case of a simplified system of\na single occupied state on either side of the barrier. If\nthe occupied states are equivalent (i.e. they have the\nsame energy or the same decomposition by energy), then\ntransfer across the barrier is blocked and \u03c7(\u03bb) = 1. If\nthe two states are orthogonal to one another (have different energies or orthogonal decompositions by energy)\nthen each state behaves independently. The FCS for this\ncase is a product over that for two independent events\neach of which is of the type illustrated in Fig 1(a). This\n\nwould give \u03c7(\u03bb) = (R + T ei\u03bb )(R + T e\u2212i\u03bb ). In general,\nthe projection of the two occupied states onto one another is equal to cos2 \u03b12 , where \u03b12 is the angle between\nthe two planes in Fig 1. Now, the FCS for this simplified system is just the weighted average of the two\nprevious cases: cos2 \u03b12 + sin2 \u03b12 (R + T ei\u03bb )(R + T e\u2212i\u03bb ) =\n1 + RT sin2 \u03b12 (ei\u03bb + e\u2212i\u03bb \u2212 2).\nThe general case of a filled Fermi sea is a combination of the two types of events illustrated in Figure 1.\nThis follows from the fact that the operator he\nh is unitary and therefore has an orthonormal basis which can\nbe contructed from its eigenvectors [6]. For positive mean\ntransfer from left to right electrode Nu > 0 [8], the dimensionality of e\nh is Nu greater than that of h. There\nare therefore Nu directions with eigenvalue of he\nh equal\nto -1. The remaining eigenvalues come in pairs (e\u00b1i\u03b1j\nwith j = 1 . . . Nb ) and the 2D plane defined by the corresponding basis vectors, e2j\u22121 \u00d7 e2j , intersects the two\nmirror-planes defined by h and e\nh in two lines inclined\nat an angle \u03b1j /2. The FCS, \u03c7(\u03bb), is then given by the\nproduct over the appropriate factors for the Nu and Nb\nevents to give (2).\nThe case where Nb and Nu are both finite corresponds\nto a train of Lorentzian pulses [8] and has attracted a\nlot of attention [4, 7]. Here we show that it is possible\nto identify explicitly the sub-space for which the eigenstates of he\nh have eigenvalues different from unity. The\ncomputation of the FCS reduces to the diagonalization\nof an N \u00d7 N matrix where N = Nu + 2Nb to find the\nangles \u03b1i from its eigenvalues (ei\u03b1i ). The flux through\nRt\nthe circuit, \u03c6(t) = \u2212(e/h) V (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 , can be written in\nthis case as\nei\u03c6(t) =\n\nN\nN\nY\nX\nt \u2212 p\u2217m\nAm\n=1+\n.\nt \u2212 pm\nt \u2212 pm\nm=1\nm=1\n\n(3)\n\nThe poles at pm = tm + i\u03c4m have residues Am , which are\ndetermined by the system of equations\n\u22121=\n\nN\nX\n\nAm\n,\n\u2217 \u2212p\np\nm\nm=1 n\n\nn = 1, . . . , N.\n\n(4)\n\nTo within overall phase factors, the effect of the voltage\npulse is equivalent to a multiplication of left electrode\nstates by the factor ei\u03c6(t) .\nThe states which define the space in which the eigenvalues of he\nh are different from 1 are |\u03c8m (t)i = 1/(t \u2212 pm )\nfor m = 1, . . . , N . This follows from considering explicitly the effect of U . All single particle states, \u03c8, satisfying (he\nh \u2212 1)|\u03c8i = hei\u03c6 [h, e\u2212i\u03c6 ]|\u03c8i = 0, do not change\noccupancy under the effect of U (and hence make no contribution to \u03c7(\u03bb)). For an arbitrary single-particle state\n\u03c8(t), we find using (3) and (4)\n(he\nh \u2212 1)|\u03c8i =\n\nX\n\nm,m\u2032\n\nsign(\u03c4m\u2032 )\n\n2 Am\u2032 A\u2217m fm\n.\np\u2217m \u2212 pm\u2032 t \u2212 pm\u2032\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\nHere fm is the projection of \u03c8(t) onto |\u03c8m (t)i:\nZ\ni\n1\nfm =\n\u03c8(t).\ndt\n2\u03c0\n(t \u2212 pm )\u2217\n\n(6)\n\nThe right-hand side of (5) vanishes for all \u03c8(t) orthogonal\nto the set of states {\u03c8n (t), n = 1, . . .

The case of N = 4 has also\nbeen solved analytically [9]. Case i) corresponds to the\ncase of MES. All poles of ei\u03c6 are in the same half-plane\nand all N states, |\u03c8n (t)i = 1/(t \u2212 pm ) are eigenstates of\nhe\nh with eigenvalue -1. This can be seen from (7) using\n\u2212i\u03c6(t)\n\u2032\nsign(\u03c4m \u03c4m\n) = 1, (4) and by considering de dt . These\nstates define the N non-coplanar directions which are in\none mirror plane and in the complement of the other.\nThe FCS for this case of MES corresponds to Nu = N\nunidirectional events in (2).\nCase ii) corresponds to a single bidirectional event.\nHere the FCS are just found from the eigenvalues of the\n2 \u00d7 2 matrix Mmn . Explicit calculation gives the result\np \u2212p\u2217\nsin2 \u03b1/2 = | p11 \u2212p22 |2 [4]. In this case, because the states\n|\u03c81 i and |\u03c82 i are orthogonal to each other, it is also particularly simple to compute the effect of U on the singleparticle states explicitly. We\npwork with normalized states\n|\u03c8\u0304i i = Ci |\u03c8i i where Ci = |pi \u2212 p\u2217i |. We find that the\neffect of U on the state |\u03c8\u03041\u2217 i = C1 /t \u2212 p\u22171 is to transform\nit into a linear combination of \u03c8\u03041 and \u03c8\u03042 :\nei\u03c6(t) |\u03c8\u03041\u2217 i =\n\nC1 (p\u22172 \u2212 p2 )\np1 \u2212 p\u22172\n|\u03c8\u03041 i.\n|\u03c8\u03042 i +\nC2 (p1 \u2212 p2 )\np1 \u2212 p2\n\n(8)\n\nIf |\u03c81\u2217 i is in the mirror plane corresponding to h then the\ncomponent of the transformed state proportional to |\u03c81 i\nis in the complement of the mirror plane and its amplip \u2212p\u2217\ntude is given by sin \u03b12 ei\u03c61 = p11 \u2212p22 a result previously\nobtained using an operator formalism [7].\nIn the general case when Nb is not finite [8], the geometric approach simplifies calculations when the transparency, T , (or the scattering phase shifts in other problems) are low, it is possible to deduce the results without\nthe need for any direct diagonalization. We illustrate\nthis by rederiving the standard result for the orthogonality catastrophe or Fermi edge singularity (FES) problem\nand then use the method to generalise results for the\n\nFCS for a system subjected to a sudden pulse of finite\nduration.\nThe FES problem arises in the context of the X-ray\nabsorption spectrum of a metal. Here, the form of the\nspectrum is determined by the response of the conduction electrons to the sudden appearance of a core hole [10]\nand has been shown to be the consequence of the orthogonality of the ground states of the Fermi gas with and\nwithout the local potential due to the core hole [11]. The\ncore hole spectral function is the Fourier transform with\nrespect to tf of the overlap between the state, U (tf )|0i,\nwhere |0i is initial ground state at t = 0 and U (tf ) the\nunitary time-development operator of the system. U (tf )\ndesribes the effect of the new potential which switches on\nat t = 0. (All states are written in the interaction basis with H0 the Hamiltonian of the unperturbed system.)\nThis is a one-channel version of the\nQ problem we have considered. The overlap h0|U |0i = k cos \u03b1k /2, where the\ne\u00b1i\u03b1k are the eigenvalues of he\nh. When the rotation angles \u03b1k are small,\nwe\ncan\nexpand\nthe cosine to obtain\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\ne\nh0|U |0i \u2248 exp 8 Tr(hh \u2212 1) . In the usual one-channel\nFES problem, U = ei\u03c6(t) where \u03c6(t) = 2\u03c60 \u03b8(t)\u03b8(tf \u2212 t)\nand where \u03c60 is the phase shift of the core hole potential computed on the scattering (unperturbed) states of\nthe system. If we work in the time-domain, h(t, t\u2032 ) =\n1\ni\n\u03c0 P( t\u2212t\u2032 ) where P denotes Cauchy principal part, we find\n\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2032\nTr he\nh\u22121 =\ndtdt\u2032 h(t, t\u2032 ) ei\u03c6(t) e\u2212i\u03c6(t ) \u2212 1 h(t\u2032 , t)\n= \u2212\n\n8\nsin2 \u03c60 log \u03betf ,\n\u03c02\n\n(9)\n\n(\u03be is the usual short-time cutoff of order the Fermi energy) and we recover the standard result for this problem:\n2\n2\nh0|U |0i = (\u03betf )\u2212\u03c60 /\u03c0 .\nThe FCS for a train of step pulses in the low transparency limit is known to be Poissonian [12]. Here\nwe will consider a periodic signal with pulses of length\ntp and period S applied to the left electrode with respect to the right electrode: V (t) = 2\u03c60 (\u03b4(t \u2212 nS) \u2212\n\u03b4(t \u2212 nS \u2212 tp )). The geometry of this situation is\nvery similar to that of the core hole Green's function\nin the FESP\nproblem. The general result (2) then gives\nlog \u03c7(\u03bb) = k log[1 + T R sin2 \u03b1k /2(ei\u03bb + e\u2212i\u03bb \u2212 2)]. In\nthe P\nlimit of T R \u226a 1, we can expand the logarithm and\nuse k sin2 \u03b12k = \u2212 41 Tr(he\nh \u2212 1). We find\n\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4 X\ntp + S(m \u2212 n \u2212 1)\ne\nTr hh \u2212 1 = \u2212 2\nlog\n\u03c0 m,n\nS(m \u2212 n \u2212 1) + \u03c4\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\ntp + S(m \u2212 n)\nsin2 \u03c60 , (10)\n+ log\nS(m \u2212 n) + \u03c4\n\nwhere \u03c4 is short time cut-off used to characterise the\ndelta-function \u03b4(t) = \u03c0(t2\u03c4+\u03c4 2 ) and Nu = 0 for this periodic train of pulses. In (10), the terms with m = n and\n\n\f4\nm = n + 1 are divergent for \u03c4 \u2192 0, while all other terms\nare convergent. With a measurement time N S we obtp i\u03bb\n2\ntain the usual result log \u03c7(\u03bb) = 2N RT\n\u03c0 2 sin \u03c60 log \u03c4 (e +\n\u2212i\u03bb\ne\n\u2212 2).\nFinally we comment on the logarithmic contributions\nto the noise which are present even in the absence of an\napplied voltage pulse and limit possible applications and\nthe observability of minimal noise states. When calculating the FCS, the system is assumed to have been prepared\nin the ground state of the system with zero transmission\nT = 0. The scattering matrix is taken to be different\nfrom unity only during the observation time t0 when the\ntransmission becomes non-zero (T > 0) and the number\nof particles on a particular side of the barrier is no longer\na good quantum number. The geometry of this situation is similar to the case of the step pulse in voltage except that the unitary transformation acting on the initial\nstates mixes states on both sides of the barrier [13]. In\npractice, these logarithmic corrections imply that the observation time t0 for the MES and other effects discussed\nhere to be observable above the equilibrium noise must\nbe short. For a system with \u01ebF = 10meV and setting\nthe equilibrium noise at low temperatures ( \u03c012 log \u01ebF t0 /h)\nequal to the minimal noise obtained using from a MES\ncorresponds to working at frequencies \u03bd > 300 MHz.\n\n[1] C.

However, in the\nequilibrium case it is possible to switch to a basis of scattering states which diagonalizes the scattering matrix S\nand identify the corresponding angles easily.\n\n\f"}
