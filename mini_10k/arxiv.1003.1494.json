One of the major\nproblems to be solved is related to the efficient access to this\ninformation that is retrieved by human actors or robots\n(agents). Our work falls under this context. We propose a\nsolution to seek the relevant sources within sight of a query\nuser. The data sources which we consider are the research tasks\nof laboratory LRIT1 of the Faculty of Science Rabat Morocco.\nFacing such a problem, we seek in this work to analyze more\nprecisely inter-connected themes between the authors, the\npublications and sets of themes of LRIT laboratory.\n\nII.\n\nONTOLOGY\n\nThe concept of ontology became a key component in a\nwhole range of application calling upon knowledge. Ontology\nis defined like the conceptualization of the objects recognized\nlike existing in a field, their properties and relations\nconnecting them. Their structure makes it possible to represent\nknowledge of a field under a data-processing format in order\nto make them usable for various applications.\n\nThere was some interest in the use of lattices for\ninformation retrieval by [1, 2]. These systems build the concept\nlattice associated with a document/term relation and then\nemploy various methods to access the relevant information,\nincluding the possibility for the user to search only those terms\nthat has specified. Building the Galois (concept) lattice can be\nconsidered as a conceptual clustering method since it results in\na concept hierarchy [3, 4]. This form of clustering constitutes\none of the motivations of the concept's application lattice for\nIR. This comes owing to the fact that clustering out of lattice\nmakes it possible to combine research by query and research by\nnavigation.\n\nAn ontology can be constructed in two ways: domaindependent or generic. Generic ontologies are definitions of\nconcepts in general; such as WordNet [5], which defines the\nmeaning and interrelationships of English words. A domaindependent ontology generally provides concepts in a specific\ndomain, which focuses on the knowledge in the limited area,\nwhile generic ontologies provide concepts more\ncomprehensively.\nThe implementation of ontology is generally taxonomy of\nconcepts and corresponding relations [6]. In ontology,\nconcepts are the fundamental units for specification, and\nprovide a foundation for information description. In general,\neach concept has three basic components: terms, attributes and\nrelations. Terms are the names used to refer to a specific\n\nConsequently the concept lattice generated from unit objects\nrepresents, in an exhaustive way, the possible clustering\nbetween these objects. Each cluster corresponding to a concept.\nSome of these concepts bring redundant information and are\n1\n\nGSCM-LRIT, Unit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e au CNRST,\nURAC 29, Faculty of Science, University\nof Mohammed V,\nRabat-Agdal, Morocco\n\nless interesting. This redundancy of information due to is made\nthat the properties are showed as independent, and the possible\nexistence of the semantic relations between the properties is not\ntaken into account. On the other hand, the semantic relations\nbetween the properties can exist. So it proves to be useful to\nuse ontology or taxonomy of field. In order to make correspond\nas well as possible the relevance of the user and the relevance\nof the system, we used a stage of query reformulation. The\ninitial query is treated like a test to find information. The\ndocuments initially presented are examined and a formulation\nimproved of the query is built from ontology, in hope to find\nmore relevant documents. The query reformulation is done in\ntwo principal stages: to find terms; extension to the initial\nquery, and to add these terms in the new query.\n\nAbstract-In this paper we describe a mechanism to improve\nInformation Retrieval (IR) on the web. The method is based on\nFormal Concepts Analysis (FCA) that it is makes semantical\nrelations during the queries, and allows a reorganizing, in the\nshape of a lattice of concepts, the answers provided by a search\nengine. We proposed for the IR an incremental algorithm based\non Galois lattice. This algorithm allows a formal clustering of the\ndata sources, and the results which it turns over are classified by\norder of relevance. The control of relevance is exploited in\nclustering, we improved the result by using ontology in field of\nimage processing, and reformulating the user queries which\nmake it possible to give more relevant documents.\nKeywords-FCA;\nReformulation)\n\nYassine Ennouary\u2021\n\u2021\n\nhttp://www.fsr.ac.ma/GSCM/id19.htm\n\n119\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2010\n\napproach is that users are often required to place a bound on\nthe number of documents retrieved as their query may be too\ngeneral, and hence, retrieve too many irrelevant documents.\n\nconcept, and can include a set of synonyms that specify the\nsame concepts. Attributes are features of a concept that\ndescribe the concept in more detail. Finally relations are used\nto represent relationships among different concepts and to\nprovide a general structure to the ontology. Figure 1 is an\nexample of a simple ontology about the organization of\nconcepts used in image processing.\n\nAn alternative approach that has gained in interest recently\nis to apply the FCAs [9]. The advantage of this approach is\nthat users can refine their query by browsing through well\ndefined clusters in the form of a graph. The principal idea of\nthe re-injection of relevance is to select the important terms\nbelonging to the documents considered to be relevant by user,\nand to reinforce importance of these terms in the new query\nformulation. This method has double advantage a simplicity\nrun for user who s' doesn't occupy of the details of\nreformulation, and a better control of the process of research\nby increasing the weight of the important terms and by\ndecreasing that of the non important terms. In the case of\nautomatic reformulation, user does' not intervene. Extension\nof the query can be carried out to leave a thesaurus or an\nontology, which defines the relations between the various\nterms and makes it possible to select new terms to be added to\nthe initial query.\n\nIn this ontology example, every node is a concept defined\nin image processing field. For each concept, there should be a\nset of attributes used to specify the corresponding concept. For\ninstance, for the concept \"Segmentation\", the attributes of\nname and type are shown, and help explain the corresponding\nconcept.\nThe relations between different concepts are also\nsimplified. In a real application, several types of concept\nrelations are used.\nImage processing\n\nRehaussement\n\nTransmission Compression\n\nIn this work, to hold account the semantic relations\nbetween the concepts; we used an ontology presented in figure\n1. This ontology will be used for query reformulation, which\nwe used two types of modes respectively reflect reformulation\nby generalization and reformulation by specialization:\n\nSegmentation\n- name\n- type\n\nSeuillage\nHistogram\n\nEqualization\nhistogram\n\nPass-bas\nfilter\n\nFilter\n\nSegmentation by Segmentation by\napproach (border)\nclustering or\nseuillage\n\nNo\nlinear\nfilter\n\nLinear\nfilter\n\nPass-haut\nfilter\n\nSegmentation by\napproach (area)\n\nPass-band\nfilter\n\nKNN\nfilter\n\n- Reformulation by generalization: consists in locating the\ntop c of T (tree) corresponding to one of the properties\nappearing in the query. Then traversing the way of c until the\nroot and adding to the query the tops met.\n\nDetection of\ncontour\nSNN\nfilter\n\nCanny\nfilter\n\n- Reformulation by specialization: consists also in locating\nthe top c corresponding to one of the properties appearing in\nthe query. But this time traversing under T which has like root\nc and then extracting all the tops, sheets from under tree and\nadding them to the query.\n\nFigure 1. An example of ontology in field of image processing\n\nIII.\n\nQUERY REFORMULATION\n\nHowever, it is often difficult for user to formulate exact his\nrequirement in information. Consequently, the results which\nthe SRI provides them are not appropriate. To find relevant\ninformation by using the only initial query is always difficult,\nand this because of inaccuracy of the query. In order to make\ncorrespond as well as possible the relevance of the user and the\nrelevance of the system, a stage of query reformulation is often\nused.\n\nIV.\n\nFORMAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS\n\nAmong the mathematical theories recently found with\nimportant applications in computer science, lattice theory has\na specific place for data organization, information engineering,\nand data mining. It may be considered as the mathematical\ntool that unifies data and knowledge or information retrieval\n[2, 3, 10, 11, 12].\n\nThe query reformulation can be interactive or automatic\n[7]. The interactive query reformulation is the strategy of\nreformulation of the most popular query. It is named\ncommonly re-injection of the relevance or \"relevance\nfeedback\". In a cycle of re-injection of relevance, one presents\nto user a list of documents considered to be relevant by the\nsystem like answer to the initial query. After examined them,\nuser indicates how he considers them relevant. This system\nallows users to expand or refine their query through the use of\nrelevance feedback [8]. The typical scenario begins with a user\nindicating which documents retrieved from a query are most\nrelevant. The system then tries to extract terms which co-exist\nin these documents and adds them to the original query to\nretrieve more documents. This process can be repeated as\nmany times as desired. However, the limitation of this\n\nA. Formal Context\nA context is a triplet (G, M, I) which G and M are units\nand I \u2286 G\u00d7M is a relationR. The elements of G are called the\nobjects, M a finite set of elements called properties and R is a\nbinary relation defined between G and M. The notation gIm\nmeans that \"formal object g verifies property m in relation R\".\nExample: Let G = {s1, s2, s3, s4}, be a set of source and M\n= {p1, p2, p3, p4, p5} be a set of the properties (table 1). The\nmathematical structure which is used to describe formally this\ntable is called a formal context (or briefly a context) [4, 9, 10,\n13].\n\n120\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2010\n\nB. Galois (Concept) lattice\nThe family of the entire formal context ordinate by the\nrelation \u2265 is called Galois (or concepts) lattice. It consists in\nassociating properties with sources, and organizing the sources\naccording to these properties. Each such pair (G, M) is called a\nformal concept (or briefly a concept) of the given context. The\nset G is called the extent, the set M the intent of the concept\n(G, M). Between the concepts of a given context there is a\nnatural hierarchical order, the \"subconcept-superconcept\"\nrelation. In general, a concept c is a subconcept of a concept d\n(and d is called a superconcept of c) if the extent of c is a\nsubset of the extent of d (or equivalently: if the intent of c is a\nsuperset of the intent of d). An efficient algorithm for\nextracting the set of all concepts of a given context is Ganter's\n`Next Closure' algorithm [11]. The algorithm can efficiently\ncompute all concepts C (G, M, I) from a context (G,M,I). The\nconcept lattice corresponds to the formal context of table 1 is\npresented in figure 2 (Hasse diagram). A line diagram consists\nof circles, lines names of all objects and all attributes of the\ngiven context. The circles represent the concepts.\nTABLE I.\nG\u00d7M\n\ns1\ns2\ns3\ns4\n\nV.\n\nA. Building concepts lattice\n(i) Data sources\nThe data used for test were extracted from titles of a subset\nof documents from the LRIT (Research laboratory in computer\nscience and Telecommunications). The laboratory LRIT\nconsists of several research groups, their activities are based\non the interaction between the contents (audio, image, text,\nvideo. Consequently there are several publications in several\nfields (image processing, signal processing, data mining, data\nengineering, information retrieval ...), it there has also other\npublications heterogeneous, which requires a system that\nmakes it possible to determine the interconnections between\nwork of the various members to make emerge and understand\nthe orientations of principal research in the team and also in\nlaboratory LRIT, and thus to provide explanations on the\nresearch task.\nFor efficient purposes, the data that was extracted from the\ndocuments were stored in XML database file; which is used\nfor the extraction of the properties or to post the results with\nthe users. Each publication (or source) is represented by two\ntags <document...> and </document>. It has an attribute\nnumber with value 1 and two child elements author and title,\nthere is also the possibility to add of extra information\nconcerning the publications in these XML file. Figure 3 shows\nthe listing of document 1, 2 and 3 from data set. Each\ndocument in the collection has a corresponding title, author's,\nand but not necessarily an abstract.\n\nAN EXAMPLE OF FORMAL CONTEXT\np1\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\nP2\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\np3\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\np4\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nIMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS\n\np5\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n<?xml version=\u2032\u20321.0\u2032\u2032 encoding=\u2032\u2032 UTF-8\u2032\u2032?>\n<documents>\n<document nom=\u2032\u2032dcument_1\u2032\u2032>\n<auteur>Amine A</auteur>\n<auteur>Elakadi A></auteur>\n<auteur>Rziza M</auteur>\n<auteur>Aboutajdine D</auteur>\n<title>ga-svm and mutual information based frequency feature selection for\nface recognition</titre>\n</document>\n<document nom=\u2032\u2032dcument_2\u2032\u2032>\n<auteur>El Fkihi S</auteur>\n<auteur>Daoudi M></auteur>\n<auteur>Aboutajdine D</auteur>\n<title>the\nmixture of\nk-optimal-spanning-trees based probability\napproximation: application to skin detection image and vision computing</titre>\n</document>\n<document nom=\u2032\u2032dcument_3\u2032\u2032>\n<auteur>El Hassouni M</auteur>\n<auteur>Cherifi H></auteur>\n<auteur>Aboutajdine D</auteur>\n<title>hos-based image sequence noise renoval</titre>\n</document>\n\nFigure 2.

The lattice\ncorresponding is presented in the figure 6.\nTABLE II.\n\nOur procedure for implementation FCA's, concept lattice\ninvolves three stages : constructing a matrix of document-term\nrelations using data stored from XML file ; concept extraction\nusing Add Intent algorithm; and partial ordering of formal\nconcepts. The resulting internal data structure is ten written\nout to a file where it may be later used for querying (figure 4).\n\nSegmentation\n\nConcepts\nLattice.txt\n\nBuild\nLattice\n\nStop word\n\nTerm\nfrequency\n\nExtract\nConcepts and\nrelation of\nsubsumptions\n\nUpdate\nLattice with\nQuery\n\nFigure 5. Query Insertion\n\n(ii) Lattice construction\nThe problem of calculation of the concepts lattice from a\nformal context made object of several research tasks. Many\nalgorithms have been proposed for generating the Galois\nlattice from a binary relation [2, 4, 9, 13, 15, 16]. A\ncomparison of the performances of the algorithms proposed\nfor the generation of the lattices and their corresponding Hasse\ndiagrams are presented in algorithm Add Intent [10]. Among\nthe algorithms proposed, some have specificity to perform an\nincremental building of concepts lattices starting from formal\ncontexts [2, 4, 10]. This aspect is particularly interesting for\nthe application of concepts lattices to our problem of research\nin the publications of the LRIT. Indeed, the queries users can\nbe inserted in the lattice representing the documents (or\npublications). Following this insertion, it is possible to\ndetermine the most relevant documents guarantors with the\ncriteria expressed by user in his query.\n\nDocs.\nxml\n\nRe-Build\nContext and\nLattice\n\nConcepts\nLattice.txt\n\nAN EXAMPLE OF FORMAL CONTEXT FROM DATABASE SOURCE\nM\\G\n\nimage\ndetection\nSegmentation\nClassification\nvision\nprobability\n\nd1\n\nd2\n\nd3\n\nd4\n\nd5\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\nThe Galois lattice establishes a clustering of the data\nsources. Each formal concept of the lattice represents in fact a\nclass. For example, the concept ({d1, d4}, {probability,\nsegmentation}) puts in the same class the data sources d1 and\nd4. These two sources are in this class because they are the\nonly ones to share the properties probability, segmentation.\nThe lattice establishes also a hierarchy between the classes.\nOne can read that there formal concept is ({d1, d4},\n{probability, segmentation}) more particular than ({d1, d2,\nd4}, {segmentation}) in the direction where it has more\nproperties it is what results in the fact that {d1, d2} included\n{d1, d2, d4}. We note that this hierarchy is with double\ndirections, i.e., the lattice is a kind of \"tree structure\" with two\n\"roots\": ({d1, d2, d3, d4, d5}, {}) and ({}, {classification,\ndetection, image, probability, segmentation, vision}) that we\nwill respectively call top and bottom. Displacement towards\ntop corresponds to generalization and that towards bottom to\nspecialization.\n\nContext.\ntxt\n\nRecovery\nof the\ncontext\n\nFigure 4. Process of building of concepts lattice\n\n(iii) Query Insertion\nOur idea is to consider the user query as a new source\nwhose properties are the terms of the query. This source will\nbe added to the lattice Li produced by I first objects of the\ncontext in ways incremental using the algorithm Add Intent\n[10]. This addition will transform the lattice Li; new nodes\nwill be added and others will be modified. It is necessary all\nthe same to notice the appearance of a new concept which has\nlike intention exactly the terms of the query.\n\n122\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2010\n\n1 - d5\nIt is noticed that, indeed, the turned over sources are all\nrelevant in the direction where they have at least a property\ndesired by the user and which they were provided in\ndecreasing order relevance.\n\nIn second step, we built the concept lattice (figure 8)\nbased on a formal context of 7 documents containing the\nproperties used in ontology presented in figure 1.\nIn query insertion, let us suppose that we formulate the\nfollowing query: `detection of contour' (shortened by dc.).\nThis query will be represented as follows:\nP= ({Query}, {dc.}). It can be connected with a new Query\nsource which has the properties: `detection of contour'. The\nlattice, after addition of the query, will change like below\nfigure 9.\n\nFigure 6. Trellis of concepts associated to table 2\n\nLet us suppose that the user formulates the following\nquery: detection, segmentation. This query will be represented\nas follows: ({Query}, {detection, segmentation}). It can be\nconnected with a new query source which has the properties:\ndetection, segmentation. And the lattice, after the addition of\nthe query, will change as it is illustrated in the figure 7.\n\nFigure 8. Concept lattice associated to 7 documents containing the concepts\nused in figure 1\n\nFigure 7. Trellis of concepts after query insertion\n\nIn our example (figure 7), the user query will generate the\nfollowing answers: On the first level of the node ({Query, d4},\n{detection, segmentation}), the extension part comprises the\nd4 source. What means that d4 is the most relevant source for\nthis query in the lattice and thus one will attribute him the\nrank=0. On the second level, the provided answers will be the\nd1 sources, d2, and d5 and attributes their consequently the\nrank=1. The d1 sources and d2 in common have with the\nquery the property `segmentation', whereas the source d5\ndivision the property `detection' with the query. And thus the\nresult will be presented like continuation:\n0 - d4\nFigure 9. Concept lattice after query insertion\n\n1 - d1\n1 - d2\n\n123\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2010\n\nIn our example (figure 9), the user query will generate the\nfollowing answers:\nOn the first level of the node ({Query, d3, d4, d7}, {dc.}),\nthe extension part comprises the d3 sources, d4, and d7. What\nmeans that the latter are the most relevant sources for this\nquery in the lattice and thus one their will attribute their\nrank=0. On the second level there is the top concept\nconsequently it is necessary to stop. The result will be\npresented like continuation:\n0-d3\n0-d4\n0-d7\n\nOn the other hand, using the semantic relations between\nthe properties in ontology in field of image processing (figure\n2). The query reformulation by specialization gives: {dc.\nCanny filter}. After the insertion of this new query in the\nlattice (figure 10) the result turning over is as follows:\n\nFigure 11. Concept lattice after query reformulation by generalization\n\nWe saw that this ontology enables us to take into account\nthe semantic relations between the properties. Moreover, the\npossibility of making a research by specialization or\ngeneralization has an advantage of having more relevant\nsources to add to the initial result. The choice of reformulation\ndepends on the user. It is a reformulation by generalization,\nthe added source can be very general and consequently not\nvery precise compared to what is wished by user. And it is a\nreformulation by specialization; the added source can cover\nwith many details only one small portion of what user asks.\nBut in no case an added source cannot be completely isolated\ncompared to what is wished by user.\n\n0-d3\n0-d4\n0-d7\n1-d1\nQuery reformulation by generalization gives: {dc.\nsegmentation by approach (border) (shortened by SAF),\nsegmentation}. After the insertion of this one in the lattice one\nhas like result:\n0-d3\n\nVI.\n\n0-d4\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe presented in this paper an proposal in the Information\nRetrieval (IR), using Formal Concepts Analysis (FCA). The\nconcept lattice evolves during the process of IR; the user is not\nmore restricted with a static structure calculated once for all,\nand the system is domain independent and operates without\nresorting to thesauruses or other predefined sets of indexing\nterms. The system implemented allows the user to navigate in\nhierarchy of concepts to research the relevance documents to\nhis query. To perform the IR we established ontology in field\nof image processing that enables us to take into account the\nsemantic relations between the properties. Moreover, we also\nimproved the results by using two steps for query\nreformulation, reformulation by generalization, and by\nspecialization, which show the more relevant documents\nreturned by system to the user query.\n\n1-d7\nThe result did not change because the properties of the new\nquery (after reformulation by generalization) division the same\nsources (figure 11).\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\nFigure 10.
