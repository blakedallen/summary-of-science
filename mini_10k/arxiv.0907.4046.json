Introduction\nThis survey paper is based on lectures given by the author at Boston University, the Max\nPlanck Institute in Bonn, at Durham University and at the Indian Statistical Institute and\nthe SN Bose National Center for the Basic Sciences in Kolkata and the Indian Institute\nof Technology in Mumbai. The purpose of these introductory notes are to familiarize\nan audience of physicists with some of the algebraic and algebro-geometric background\nupon which Grothendieck's theory of motives of algebraic varieties relies. There have been\nmany recent developments in the interactions between high energy physics and motives,\nmostly within the framework of perturbative quantum field theory and the evaluation of\nFeynman diagrams as periods of algebraic varieties, though motives are beginning to play\nan important role in other branched of theoretical physics, such as string theory, especially\nthrough the recent interactions with the Langlands program, and through the theory of\nBPS states. We focus here mostly on the quantum field theoretic applications when we\nneed to outline examples that are of relevance to physicists. The appendix to the paper,\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 19E15, 14C25, 81T18, 18F30.\nKey words and phrases. motives, K-theory, Grothendieck ring, algebraic cycles, motivic zeta functions,\nFeynman graphs, tensor categories, gauge theory, dualities, mirror symmetry.\nPart of this work was done while the author was employed by the Clay Mathematics Institute as a\nJunior Research Scholar.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\nwritten by Matilde Marcolli, sketches several examples of how the main ideas involved in\nthe theory of motives, algebraic cycles, periods, Hodge structures, K-theory, have in fact\nbeen already involved in many different ways in theoretical physics, from condensed matter\nphysics to mirror symmetry. Most of the paper focuses on the mathematical background.\nWe describe the Grothendieck ring of varieties and its properties, since this is where most\nof the explicit computations of motives associated to Feynman integrals are taking place.\nWe then discuss the Tannakian formalism, because of the important role that Tannakian\ncategories and their Galois groups play in the theory of perturbative renormalization after\nthe work of Connes\u2013Marcolli. We then describe the background cohomological notions\nunderlying the construction of the categories of pure motives, namely the notion of Weil\ncohomology, and the crucial role of algebraic cycles in the theory of motives. It is in fact\nmixed motives and not the easier pure motives are involved in the application to quantum\nfield theory, due to the fact that the projective hypersurfaces associated to Feynman\ngraphs are highly singular, as well as to the fact that relative cohomologies are involved\nsince the integration computing the period computation that gives the Feynman integral\nis defined by an integration over a domain with boundary. We will not cover in this survey\nthe construction of the category of mixed motives, as this is a technically very challenging\nsubject, which is beyond what we are able to cover in this introduction. However, the\nmost important thing to keep in mind about mixed motives is that they form triangulated\ncategories, rather than abelian categories, except in very special cases like mixed Tate\nmotives over a number field, where it is known that an abelian category can be constructed\nout of the triangulated category from a procedure known as the heart of a t-structure.\nFor our purposes here, we will review, as an introduction to the topic of mixed motives,\nsome notions about triangulated categories, Bloch\u2013Ogus cohomologies, and mixed Hodge\nstructures. We end by reviewing some the notion of motivic zeta function and some facts\nabout motivic integration. Although this last topic has not yet found direct applications to\nquantum field theory, there are indications that it may come to play a role in the subject.\nA word about the references: the list is much longer than the list of works cited in the\nmain body of the text. This is deliberate since the list is meant to also serve as a guide\nto futher reading.\nAcknowledgements. These notes, as noted in the introduction, form a part of my lectures on motives at various institutions in the US, Germany, the UK and India during\n2005-2009, in particular, my talk at the Bonn workshop on renormalization in December\n2006. I thank the organizers (Ebrahimi-Fard, van Suijlekom and Marcolli) for a stimulating meeting and for their infinite patience in waiting for this written contribution towards\nthe proceedings of that meeting.\n2. The Grothendieck ring\n2.1. Definition of the Grothendieck groups and rings. Recall the definition of the\nusual Grothendieck group of vector bundles on a smooth variety X:\nDefinition 2.1 (exercise 6.10 of [34]). K0 (X) is defined as the quotient of the free abelian\ngroup generated by all vector bundles (= locally free sheaves) on X by the subgroup\ngenerated by expressions F \u2212 F \u2032 \u2212 F \u2032\u2032 whenever there is an exact sequence of vector\nbundles 0 \u2192 F \u2032 \u2192 F \u2192 F \u2032\u2032 \u2192 0. The group K0 (X) can be given a ring structure via the\ntensor product.\nWe remark that isomorphism classes of vector bundles form an abelian monoid under\ndirect sum; in fact, Grothendieck groups can be defined in a much more general way\nbecause of the following universal property:\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n3\n\nProposition 2.2. Let M be an abelian monoid. There exists an abelian group K(M )\nand \u03b3 : M \u2192 K(M ) a monoid homomorphism satisfying the following universal property: If f : M \u2192 A is a homomorphism into an abelian group A, then there exists a\nunique homomorphism of abelian groups f\u2217 : K(M ) \u2192 A such that the following diagram\ncommutes:\n\u03b3\nM \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 K(M )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6f\n\uf8e6\nfy\ny\u2217\n\nA\nA\nThe proof of proposition 2.2 is very simple: construct a free abelian group F generated\nby M and let [x] be a generator of F corresponding to the element x \u2208 M . Denote by B\nthe subgroup of F generated by elements of the form [x + y] \u2212 [x] \u2212 [y] and set K(M ) to\nbe the quotient of F by B. Letting \u03b3 to be the injection of M into F and composing with\nthe canonical map F \u2192 F/B shows that \u03b3 satifies the universal property.\nOne can show that projective modules over a ring A give rise to a Grothendieck group\ndenoted as K(A) (p. 138 of [40]). This is simply done by noting that isomorphism classes\nof (finite) projective A-modules form a monoid (again under the operation of direct sum)\nand taking the subgroup B to generated by elements of the form [P \u2295Q]\u2212[P ]\u2212[Q] for finite\nprojective modules P and Q. We can refine K(A) by imposing the following equivalence:\nP is equivalent to Q \u21d0\u21d2 there exists free modules F, F \u2032 such that [P \u2295 F ] = [Q \u2295 F \u2032 ].\nTaking the quotient of K(A) with respect to this equivalence relation gives us K0 (A).\nThe explicit determination of K0 (and its \"higher dimensional\" analogues) for a given\nring A is the rich subject of algebraic K-theory. (A standard reference for algebraic Ktheory is [52]; see also the work-in-progress [58].) For the simplest case when A is a field,\nwe note that K0 (A) \u2243 Z; this immediately follows from the definition and the trivial\nfact that modules over a field are vectors spaces. As a non-trivial example, we have the\nfollowing\nExample 2.3 (example 2.1.4 of [58]). Let A be a semisimple ring with n simple modules.\nThen K0 (A) \u2243 Zn .\nThrough the theorem of Serre-Swan which demonstrates that the categories of vector\nbundles and finite projective modules are equivalent, we see that definition 2.1 arise very\nnaturally from proposition 2.2. Furthermore, the generality of proposition 2.2 enables us\nconstruct Grothendieck groups and rings of (isomorphism classes of) other objects as well.\nLet Vark the category of quasi-projective varieties over a field k. Let X be an object\nof Vark and Y \u0592\u2192 X a closed subvariety. Central to our purposes would be the following\nDefinition 2.4. The Grothendieck ring K(Vark ) is the quotient of the free abelian group\nof isomorphism classes of objects in Vark by the subgroup generated the expressions\n[X] \u2212 [Y ] \u2212 [X \\ Y ]. The ring structure given by fiber product: [X] * [Y ] := [X \u00d7k Y ].\nIn fact one can generalize definition 2.4 to define the Grothendieck ring of a symmetric\nmonodial category. Recall the following\nDefinition 2.5 (defintion 5.1 of chapter II of [58]). A category C is called symmetric\nmonoidal if there is a functor \u2297 : C \u2192 C and a distinguished I \u2208 Obj (C) such that the\nfollowing are isomorphisms for all S, T, U \u2208 Obj (C):\nI\u2297S \u223c\n= S\nS\u2297I \u223c\n= S\n\u223c\nS \u2297 (T \u2297 U ) = (S \u2297 T ) \u2297 U\nS\u2297T \u223c\n= T \u2297 S.\n\n\f4\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\nFurthermore one requires the isomorphisms above to be coherent, a technical condition\nthat guarantees that one can write expressions like S1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Sn without paranthesis\nwithout ambiguity1. (See any book on category theory for the precise definitions.)\nRemark 2.6. The category Vark is symmetric monodial with the functor \u2297 given by\nfiber product of varieties and the unit object I given by A0 = point.\nAn important example of a symmetric monoidal category is furnished by the category\nof finite dimensional complex representations of a finite group G (with the morphisms\ngiven by intertwinners between representations), denoted as RepC (G).\nExample 2.7 (example 5.2.3 of [58]). RepC (G) is symmetric monodial under direct\nsums of representations. Furthermore, K0 (RepC (G)) \u2243 R(G) generated by irreducible\nrepresentations and where R(G) is the representation ring of G.\nNote that for more general G (say an affine group scheme over an arbitrary base),\nthe category RepC (G) has much more structure that being merely symmetric monodial,\nnamely it is a Tannakian category. We will turn to this rich subject in section 3.\n2.2. The Grothendieck ring of varieties K(Vark ). Recall definition 2.4. The Grothendieck\nring K(Vark ) has the following properties (cf. the review [54]):\n(1) If X is a variety and U, V locally closed subvarieties in X, then\n[U \u222a V ] + [U \u2229 V ] = [U ] + [V ].\n(2) If\nPnX is the disjoint union of locally closed subvarieties X1 , . . . , Xn , then [X] =\ni=1 [Xi ].\n(3) Let C be a constructible subset of a variety X (that is, C is the disjoint union of\nlocally closed subsets of X.) Then C has a class in K(Vark ).\nIn section 6 of [42], Marcolli proposes a category of Feynman motivic sheaves which involves\nviewing the Kirchhoff polynomial as a morphism \u03a8\u0393 : An \\ X\u0393 \u2192 Gm where X\u0393 is viewed\nas an affine hypersurface obtained by setting \u03a8\u0393 = 0. (Here n is the number of edges\nof \u0393 and Gm is the multiplicative group. ) As a setting for such relative questions, we\nintroduce the following:\nDefinition 2.8 (Bittner, 2.1.1 of [54]). Let S be a variety over k. The ring K(VarS ) is\nthe free abelian group generated by isomorphism classes [X]S (where X is a variety over\nS) modulo the relation [X]S = [X \\ Y ]S + [Y ]S where Y \u2282 X is a closed subvariety. The\nring structure is induced by the fiber product of varieties.\nRemark 2.9. We note the following properties of K(VarS ):\n(1) K(VarS ) is a K(Vark )-module.\n(2) There is an bilinear associative exterior product\n\u22a0\n\nK(VarS ) \u00d7 K(VarT ) \u2212\u2192 K(VarS\u00d7k T ).\n(3) Let f : S \u2192 S \u2032 be a morphism of varieties. It induces f! : K(VarS ) \u2192 K(VarS \u2032 )\nand f \u2217 : K(VarS \u2032 ) \u2192 K(VarS ) that are functorial with respect to \u22a0: let g : T \u2192\nT \u2032 be another morphism of varieties. Then (f \u00d7 g)! (A \u22a0 B) = f! (A) \u22a0 g! (B) and\n(f \u00d7 g)\u2217 (A \u22a0 B) = f \u2217 (A) \u22a0 f \u2217 (B).\nNote that in case of S = Spec k, the definition 2.8 is the same as definition 2.4.\n1Note that we will sometimes call a symmetric monodial category an \"ACU \u2297-category\" and refer to\n\nthe functor \u2297 as the tensor functor.\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n5\n\nTheorem 2.10 ([6], from [54]). Let k a field of characteristic zero. Then K(Vark ) is\ngenerated by smooth varieties.\nThe idea behind the proof is this (proof of proposition 2.1.2 of [54]): Set d := dimX\nand let X \u0592\u2192 X \u2032 for a complete variety X \u2032 . Writing [X] + [Z] = [X \u2032 ] for some Z with\ndimZ \u2264 d\u22121 and using Hironaka's theorem, we get [X \u2032 ] = [X \u2032 ]\u2212([C]\u2212[E]) where C is the\nsmooth center of the blowup X \u2032 and E its exceptional divisor with dimC, dimE \u2264 d \u2212 1.\nWe can write any arbitrary X as the disjoint union of smooth varieties in this way by\ninducting on d.\nIn K(Vark ), there are two \"distinguished\" classes, the class of a point [A0 ] and the\nclass of the affine line A1 = Spec k[x] denoted as L. The standard cell decomposition of\nthe projective space in terms of flags (see p.194 of [30]) can be lifted to K(Vark ) in terms\nof these classes:\nn\u22121\nX\n1 \u2212 Ln+1\nn\nLi =\n[P ] = 1 +\n1\u2212L\ni=0\n\n(1 + T)n+1 \u2212 1\nT\n1\n0\nwhere T := [A ] \u2212 [A ] the class of the torus Gm .\nIn order to prove this decomposition, note that [P1k \\ A1k ] = [P1k ] \u2212 [A1k ] since A1k \u2282 P1k is\n\u2243 Pnk .\n\\ An+1\nopen with \u221e as the compliment. Induction gives the result since Pn+1\nk\nk\nOne can formally invert L in K(Vark ) to get the Tate motive denoted as Q(1).

Then we have\nExample 2.12 (Aluffi-Marcolli, theorem 3.10 of [1]). The class associated to the banana\ngraph hypersurfaces X\u0393n is given by\n[X\u0393n ] =\n=\n\n(1 + T)n \u2212 1 Tn \u2212 (\u22121)n\n\u2212\n\u2212 nTn\u22122\nT\nT+1\nLn \u2212 1 (L \u2212 1)n \u2212 (\u22121)n\n\u2212\n\u2212 n(L \u2212 1)n\u22122 .\nL\u22121\nL\n\nThere is an alternative characterization of K(Vark ) due to Bittner, which is also sometimes useful in the context of Feynman graphs and motives.\nDefinition 2.13 (definition 2.3 of [54]). K bl (Vark ) is the abelian group generated by\nsmooth complete varieties, subject to the conditions\n\n\f6\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\n(1) [\u2205] = 0 and\n(2) [BlY X] = [X] \u2212 [Y ] + [E] where Y is a smooth and complete subvariety of X and\nBlY X is the blowup of X along Y with the exceptional divisor of the blowup E.\nWe need to show that the definitions 2.4 and 2.13 do coincide, following [54]. To do this\nwe need to show that there exists a map K(Vark )\u2192K bl (Vark ) which is an isomorphism.\nThis is constructed as an induced map from a map \u01eb on varieties satisfying e(X \\ Y ) =\ne(X) \u2212 e(Y ). The map e is constructed in the following way: Let X be the smooth\ncompletion of a smooth connected variety X and D = X \\ X a normal crossing divisor.\nP\nLet us define the map e(X) =\n(\u22121)l [D (l) ]bl with D (l) denoting the disjoint union of\nl-fold intersections of irreducible components of D. ([\u2212]bl denotes a class in K bl (Vark ).)\nThe fact that e(X) is independent of the choice of completion X follows from the weak\nfactorization theorem. The fact that the e(X) = e(X \\ Y ) + e(Y ) is proved by choosing\na smooth and complete X \u2282 X such that D = X \\ X is simple normal crossing and the\nclosure Y in X is smooth and normal-crossing with divisor D. (D \u2229 Y is simple normal\ncrossings divisor in Y .)\nYet another useful result, which can be useful in applications in the context of Feynman\ngraphs, is the following.\nProposition 2.14 ([54]). Let X be a smooth connected variety, Y \u2282 X a smooth connected\nsubvariety of X of codimension d. Let E be the exceptional divisor of the blowup BlY X of\nX along Y . Then\n[BlY X] = [X] + L[E] \u2212 Ld [Y ].\nA consequence of proposition 2.14 is the notion of Tate twist: there is a ring involution\nL 7\u2192 L\u22121 = and [X] 7\u2192 L\u2212dimX [X] = Q(1)dimX [X].\nThis is the true meaning of the Tate twist alluded above. In cohomological calculations,\nthe product of Q(1)dimX and [X] is replaced by a tensor product of a one dimensional\nrational vector space (\"working mod torsion\") raised to the dimension of the variety whose\ncohomology is being computed and a piece of the cohomology. In fact this correspondence\nbetween classes in K(Vark ) and cohomology is one important aspect of the theory of\nmotives.\nThe reader may wonder what K(Vark ) explicitly is and how does it depend on k. The\nfact of the matter is that this is a very hard question though certain things are known.\nFor example, we have\nTheorem 2.15 (Poonen, theorem 1 of [51]). Let k be a field of characteristic zero. Then\nK(Vark ) is not an integral domain.\nIn fact when k = C, we have\nTheorem 2.16 (Larsen\u2013Lunts, theorem 2.3 of [41]). Let I be the ideal generated by the\naffine line, i.e., I = L and denote by SB the monoid of classes of stable birational complex\nvarieties (the monoid structure coming from fiber products of varieties.) Then\nK(Vark )/I \u2243 Z[SB].\n(Two varieties X and Y are stably birational if X \u00d7 Pm is birational to Y \u00d7 Pn for\nm, n \u2265 0.)\nIn Sahasrabudhe's thesis [54], theorem 2.16 is proved using Bittner's definition 2.13.\nThe main obstruction in obtaining results like theorems 2.15 and 2.16 in characteristic\np is that those results depend crucially on the resolution of singularities and the weak\nfactorization of birational morphisms, statements that are not yet known to hold true in\ncharacteristic p.\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n7\n\n2.3. A Grothendieck ring for supermanifolds. One can generalize the construction\nof the Grothendieck ring of Vark in a quite straightforward way for the category of complex\nsupermanifolds. (See [47] for a standard introduction to supermanifolds.)\nDefinition 2.17 (definition 2.2 of [44]). Let SVarC be the category of complex supermanifolds. Let K(SVarC ) denote the free abelian group generated by the isomorphism\nclasses of objects X \u2208 Obj (SVarC ) subject to the following relations. Let F : Y \u0592\u2192 X be\na closed embedding of supermanifolds. Then\n[X ] = [Y] + [X \\ Y],\nwhere X \\ Y is the supermanifold\nX \\ Y = (X \\ Y, AX |X\\Y ).\nThe standard notation AX |X\\Y denotes restriction of the sheaf of supercommutative\nrings on X to the compliment. We can relate K(SVarC ) to K(VarC ) through\nProposition 2.18 (corollary 2.4 of [44]). The Grothendieck ring K(SVarC ) of supervarieties is a polynomial ring over the Grothendieck ring of ordinary varieties of the form\nK(SVarC ) = K(VC )[T ],\nwhere T = [A0|1 ] is the class of the affine superspace of dimension (0, 1).\nThe notion of birational and stable birational equivalence can be generalized also in a\nstraightforward way to supermanifolds: two supermanifolds X and Y are said to stable\nbirationally equivalent if there are superprojective spaces Pn|m and Pr|s such that X \u00d7\nPn|m is birationally equivalent to Y \u00d7 Pr|s . Denote by Z[SSB] the monoidal ring of such\nsupermanifolds. Then we have a result similar to theorem 2.16.\nProposition 2.19 (corollary 2.5 of [44]). There is an isomorphism\nK(SVarC )/I \u2243 Z[SSB],\nwhere I is the ideal generated by the classes [A1|0 ] and [A0|1 ].\nThe main application of the Grothendieck rings constructed in this section is in defining\na large class of topological and arithmetic invariants as measures on these rings. We take\nup this subject in section 7.\n3. The Tannakian formalism\n3.1. Categorical notions. Most of the material in this section is based on [21] and\nBreen's survey of Saveedra-Rivano's thesis under Grothendieck [53]. In a nutshell, the\nmain idea behind a Tannakian category is to equip an abelian category with a natural\nfunctor to vector spaces such that a fiber over each object in this category is a finite\ndimensional vector space.\nLet (C, \u2297) be a symmetric monoidal category.\nDefinition 3.1 (Internal homs). Let X, Y \u2208 Obj (C) and consider the functor\nF : C \u2192 Set,\nT 7\u2192 Hom(T \u2297 X, Y ).\nIf F = Hom(\u2212, K) where K is some object in C, then define Hom(X, Y ) =: K.\nRemark 3.2. Explicitly, Hom(T \u2297 X, Y ) = Hom(T, Hom(X, Y )). This spells out the fact\nthat the functor F is representable.\n\n\f8\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\nExample 3.3. Consider the category of all R-modules ModR . This is an obvious tensor category with I = R. In ModR , Hom(X, Y ) = HomModR (X, Y ). To see this,\ndefine the functor F of definition 3.1 to be T 7\u2192 Hom(T \u2297 X, Y ). Hom-tensor adjointness states HomModR (T \u2297 X, Y ) = HomModR (T, HomModR (X, Y )) and hence F =\nHomModR (\u2212, HomModR (X, Y )) which, by definition, proves that Hom(X, Y ) = HomModR (X, Y ).\nLet evX,Y : Hom(X, Y ) \u2297 X \u2192 Y be the morphism corresponding to idHom(X,Y ) . To see\nthat this correspondence does make sense, take T = Hom(X, Y ) in definition 3.1 to get\nHom(Hom(X, Y ) \u2297 X, Y ) = Hom(Hom(X, Y ), Hom(X, Y )).\nDefine the dual of an object X as X\u0302 := Hom(X, I). For example in ModR we have the\nfollowing diagram\nHom(X, Y ) \u2297 X\nHom(X, Y ) \u2297 X\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6evX,Y\nevX,Y \uf8e6\ny\ny\nY\nY\nand evX,Y is given by f \u2297 x = f (x), the usual evaluation map in ModR . This shows that\nthe abstract notion of evaluation makes sense.\nDefinition 3.4 (Reflexive objects). Suppose we are given the following digram\nHom(X, Y )\nx\n\uf8e6\n\u03c8\uf8e6\n\nevX,I \u25e6\u03c8\n\nHom(X, Y )\nx\n\uf8e6evX,I\n\uf8e6\n\nX \u2297 X\u0302\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nI\nwhere X is an object in some tensor category. If evX,I \u25e6 \u03c8 is an isomorphism, we say\nthat X is reflexive. If all objects in a tensor category are reflexive, we call the category\nreflexive.\nRemark 3.5. We note that the above definition does correspond to our usual notion of\nreflexiveness: from the definition of internal hom,\nHom(X \u2297 X\u0302, I) = Hom(X, Hom(X\u0302, I)).\nIf evX,I \u25e6 \u03c8 is an isomorphism, we get a correspondence\n\u223c \u02c6\nevX,I \u25e6 \u03c8 \u2190\u2192 X \u2192 X\u0302\n\u223c \u02c6\nwith evX,I \u25e6 \u03c8 \u2208 Hom(X \u2297 X\u0302, I) and X \u2192 X\u0302 \u2208 Hom(X, Hom(X\u0302, I)).\n\nOf course, not all categories are reflexive. For example, a one-line argument shows that\nModR is not. (Take R = Z and consider Z/2Z.)\nPutting all of these notions together, we have\nDefinition 3.6 (Rigid tensor category). A tensor category C is said to be rigid if\n(1) Hom(X, Y ) exists for every X, Y \u2208 Obj (C).\n(2) Functoriality of internal homs: All natural maps\n\u0010O\nO \u0011\nO\nXi ,\nYi\nHom(Xi , Yi ) \u2212\u2192 Hom\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\nare isomorphisms.\n(3) (C, \u2297) is a reflexive category.\n\nWe need a last assumption for the main definition, namely that a tensor category be\nabelian. We quickly review the definition: A category A is abelian [26] is\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n9\n\n\u2022 Hom(X, Y ) is an abelian group for all x, y \u2208 Obj (A) and composition of morphisms is biadditive.\n\u2022 There exists a zero object 0 such that Hom(0, 0) = \u2205.\n\u2022 For all X, Y \u2208 Obj (A), there exists an object Z \u2208 Obj (A) and morphisms\n\u03b9X : X \u2192 Z, \u03b9Y : Y \u2192 Z, \u03c0X : Z \u2192 X and \u03c0Y : Z \u2192 Y with \u03c0X \u25e6 \u03b9X = idX ,\n\u03c0Y \u25e6 \u03b9Y = idY and \u03b9X \u25e6 \u03c0X + \u03b9Y \u25e6 \u03c0Y = idZ and \u03c0X \u25e6 \u03b9Y = \u03c0Y \u25e6 \u03b9X = 0.\nj\nk\ni\nc\n\u2022 For any f \u2208 Hom(X, Y ) there is a sequence K \u2192 X \u2192 I \u2192 Y \u2192 where K (resp.\nC) is the kernel of f (resp. cokernel of f ) and such that j \u25e6 i = f and I is both\nkernel of c and cokernel of k.\nWith this last piece at hand, we have\nDefinition 3.7 (Neutral Tannakian category). Let k be a field of arbitrary characteristic.\nA neutral Tannakian category over k is a abelian rigid tensor category C with a k-linear\nexact faithful functor called the fiber functor \u03c9 : C \u2192 Vectk with Vectk the category of\nk-vector spaces2.\nTo fix notation: a neutral Tannakian category would be denoted as a tuple (C, \u2297, \u03c9)\nwhere \u03c9(X \u2297 Y ) = \u03c9(X) \u2297 \u03c9(Y ) from the definition 3.7. Faithfulness, exactness and\nk-linearity are the usual notions.\n3.2. The structure of Repk (G). Let us come back to example 2.7 with G an affine\ngroup scheme instead, defined over k a field of arbitrary characteristic. Let V be a finite\ndimensional vector space over k. A representation of G is a morphism of affine schemes\nG \u00d7 V \u2192 V , denoted as \u03c1. The category Repk (G) is defined in the following way.\n\u2022 Objects of Repk (G) are representations (\u03c1, V ).\n\u2022 Morphisms between two representations are intertwiners. Let (\u03c11 , V1 ) and (\u03c12 , V2 )\nbe two representations.

(A more general\nconstruction of Repk (G) over R, a commutative ring with identity, ivolves V being a\nprojective R-module of finite rank.)\nBy a general well-known argument, Repk (G) is equivalent to the category of commutative (though not necessarily cocommutative) Hopf algebras3.\nThe main theorem along the lines of the classical Pontryajin duality is\nTheorem 3.8 (Tannaka-Krein theorem).

This definition has the benefit\nof being more explicit. I present it for the benefit of the reader who may want to gain a\nshift in perspective.\nLet (C, \u2297) be a symmetric monoidal category over a field k with a unit object I. (The\nk-linearity of the functor \u2297 is understood.) Furthermore assume (C, \u2297) to be abelian.\nDefinition 3.9 (Rigid tensor category, alternate). The category (C, \u2297, I) is rigid if\n(1) End (I) = Hom(I, I) \u2243 k,\n(2) For all X \u2208 Obj (C) there exist objects X\u0302 \u2208 Obj (C) and morphisms \u03b4 : I \u2192 X\u0302\u2297X\nand ev : X \u2297 X\u0302 \u2192 I such that\nid\u2297\u03b4\n\nev\u2297id\n\n\u03b4\u2297id\n\nid\u2297ev\n\nX \u2212\u2192 X \u2297 X\u0302 \u2297 X \u2212\u2192 X,\nX\u0302 \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 \u2297 X \u2297 X\u0302 \u2212\u2192 X\u0302.\nWe now define the internal hom to be Hom(X, Y ) := X\u0302 \u2297Y for all X, Y \u2208 Obj (C). One\ncan verify, upon making the identification Hom(X, Y ) = Hom(X, Y \u2297 I) that this coincide\n\u02c6 = Hom(\u2212, I). It exists if\nwith definition 3.1. The dual is a functor C \u2192 C given by (\u2212)\n\u223c\nand only if Hom(X, \u2212) exists and Hom(X, I) \u2297 Y \u2212\u2192 Hom(X, Y ). Deligne's definition of\na neutral Tannakian category is the same as definition 3.7, namely, an abelian rigid tensor\ncategory with a fiber functor \u03c9 : C \u2212\u2192 Vectk , the functor being exact, faithful, k-linear\nand preserving the tensor structure.\nThe main theorem, in any case, is a stronger formulation of theorem 3.8, variously\nattributed to Deligne, Grothendieck and Saavedra-Rivano:\nTheorem 3.10. Let T be a neutral Tannakian category over a field k. Then Aut\u2297 (\u03c9) is\nan affine group scheme over k and we have the equivalence of categories\n\u0010\n\u0011\nT \u2243 Repk Aut\u2297 (\u03c9) ,\n\nwhere Repk (\u2212) is the category of k-linear representations.

Ultimately, the rigidity features guarantee the group structure. In fact, the definition of \u03c9 in terms of \"functor-ofpoints\" suggests we look at \u03c9 with Set as the target category; this provides an interpretation of the action of the group Aut\u2297 (\u03c9) as a fundamental group, a theme we take up\nnext.\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n11\n\n3.4. Fundamental groups of schemes. Tannakian categories can also be used as a\nlanguage to understand a beautiful theory developed by Grothendieck, Artin and others,\nof the relationship between fundamental groups of \u00e9tale coverings of a scheme and Galois\ngroups. The canonical reference for this material is SGA I [31].\nDefinition 3.11 (\u00c9tale covering of a scheme). Let Y be a scheme over k. An \u00e9tale covering\nY \u2192 X is an affine morphism given by A \u2192 B with X = Spec A and Y = Spec B, A and\nB algebras, and such that\n(1) B is flat over A,\n(2) DerA B = 0 and\n(3) B is finite over A.\nExample 3.12. Let X be a smooth variety over C. Saying that Y \u2192 X is an \u00e9tale\ncovering over X is the same as YC \u2192 XC is a covering in the usual sense.\nExample 3.13. Let X = Spec k.

To see\nthis, view the category of flat vector bundles over a scheme X as being equivalent to\nthe category of representations of \u03c01 (X, x). Furthermore, the category is recovered by\nstudying the category of representations of \u03c01 (X, x) using theorem 3.10.\nI remark that theorem 3.18 is a special case of the general Grothendieck-Galois correspondence which states that the category of finite \u00e9tale k-schemes is equivalent to the\ncategory of finite sets with continuous Gk -action.\n3.5. The function-sheaf correspondence. The function-sheaf correspondence is a profound application of constructibility to obtain all \"interesting\" functions on a space over\nan arbitrary base ring in terms of certain sheaves on it. As such, it also connects with the\nGeometric Langlands program. In this subsection I scratch the surface, closely following\nthe notes of Sug Woo Shin [56].\nFix a prime l and let K be a finite extension of Ql . Denote by OK the ring of integers\nof K. Let X be a connected scheme over k with char k 6= l. Let Xet be an \u00e9tale site of\nX. Call the \u00e9tale sheaf G locally constant is f |U is locally constant for an \u00e9tale covering\nU of X. The sheaf G is said to be constructible is X is constructible (i.e. can be written\nas disjoint union of locally closed subschemes of X) and G is such that it defines a locally\nconstant sheaf, finite on each strata of X.\nDefinition 3.19 (locally constant l-adic sheaf). An l-adic sheaf on Xet is a projective\nsystem (Fn )n\u2208N of constructible sheaves Fn such that Fn+1 \u2192 Fn induces an isomorphism\nFn+1 \u2297 (Z/ln ) \u2243 Fn . An l-adic sheaf is locally constant if each Fn is so.\nOne defines a category of K-sheaves as a category whose objects are constructible OK sheaves (= constructible sheaves of OK -modules) and with\nHomK\u2212sheaves (F \u2297 K, G \u2297 K) := HomOK \u2212sheaves (F, G) \u2297OK K.\nBy taking a limit over l of the categories of K-sheaves, we obtain the category of Ql sheaves. Locally constant Ql -sheaves are limits of locally constant OK -sheaves.\nDefinition 3.20 (l-adic local system). A locally constant Ql -sheaf is called an l-adic local\nsystem.\nLet x \u2208 X be a geometric point. Let E be an l-adic local system on X. The stalk of\nE is defined as the direct limit of stalks of K-sheaves. These are, in turn, defined in the\nfollowing way: for F a OK -sheaf on X, the stalk at x is lim(Fn )x where (Fn )x are the\n\u2190\u2212\nn\nusual stalks on the \u00e9tale site. Denote the stalk of E at x as Ex . We say that the local\nsystem E has rank r if Ex contains r-copies of Ql .\nTheorem 3.21. Let x \u2208 X be a geometric point of a finite connected scheme X. The\nfunctor F \u2192 Fx makes the category of l-adic local systems on X equivalent to the category\nof continuous representations of \u03c01 (X, x) on finite dimensional Ql vector spaces.\nCompare this with theorem 3.18: in both cases, action of the automorphisms of the\nfiber functor are interpreted in terms of \"nice\" (= \u00e9tale!) geometric categories.\nWe end this discussion by noting a special case of the function-sheaf correspondence: let\nH be a (connected, seperated) commutative group scheme of finite type over Fpn with p 6= l\nand let E be an l-adic local system on H. Let m\u2217 denote the pull-back of the multiplication\nmap m : H \u00d7Fpn H \u2192 H. We call E an l-adic character sheaf if m\u2217 (E) \u2243 p\u22171 (E) \u2297 p\u22172 (E).\nHere p1 and p2 are the projection morphisms H \u00d7Fq H \u2192 H.\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n13\n\nTheorem 3.22 (Function-sheaf correspondence). We have a natural bijection of sets\nHomAbGp (H(Fq ), Ql ) \u2194 {l-adic character sheaves on H}.\nRemark 3.23. A basic fact: any commutative group scheme over a field k is always an\nextension of an abelian variety by an affine group k-scheme (= a commutative k-Hopf\nalgebra.) Therefore, we loose nothing by following the notation and thinking of H as an\nabelian variety. For example, the reader may think of H as the Picard group of a curve,\nto fix ideas.\nThe proof of theorem 3.22 uses the functoriality of the action of the absolute Frobenius4\non the stalks of l-adic local system E (cf. [56] for a nice sketch of the proof.)\n\u223c\nA speculation: Upon a fixed identification Ql \u2192 C, one way to think of theorem 3.22 is5:\nall character maps \u03c6 of a given commutative Hopf algebra H arise as appropriate l-adic\ncharacter sheaves on H. It remains a very interesting project to actually implement this\nphilosophy when H is the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs6 ([16] [17])\nand \u03c6 a Feynman rule that assigns a generally divergent projective integral to a given\nFeynman graph and understanding its relationship with the Arapura motivic sheaves and\nrenormalization as outlined in Marcolli's paper [42].\n4. Weil cohomology\nThis section presents the notion of a Weil cohomology, a set of functorial properties any\ngood cohomology theory of smooth projective varieties should satisfy. The section very\nclosely follows the first parts of Kleiman's article in [37].\n4.1. Main definition. Let k (resp. K) be fields of arbitrary characteristic (resp. zero\ncharacteristic.) Let SmProjk be the category of smooth projective schemes over k with\nsmooth scheme maps as morphisms. Let GrVect be the category of Z-graded anticommutative K-algebras with K-algebra maps that L\npreserve gradings as morphisms.\nSuppose V \u2208 Obj (GrVect). Therefore V := i\u2208Z Vi . Set V0 = K. A Weil cohomology\nis a contravariant functor\nH \u2217 : SmProjk \u2212\u2192 GrVect\nL\nwith H \u2217 (X) = n\u2208Z H i (X) that satisfies the following properties:\n4.1.1. Finiteness. Each H i (X) has finite dimension and H i (X) = 0 unless 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2dimX.\n\n4.1.2. Poincar\u00e9 duality. There are two equivalent versions. The first version goes as follows: Let r := dimX. For each such X, there is an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nH 2r (X) \u2212\u2192 K\nand a nondegenerate pairing\n\u223c\n\nH i (X) \u00d7 H 2r\u2212i (X) \u2212\u2192 K.\nThe second version of the Poincar\u00e9 duality goes as follows:\n\\\ni (X) \u2243 H 2r\u2212i (X),\nH\n4Let X be a (connected) scheme over F n . By the \"absolute Frobenius\" we mean an F n -morphism\np\np\n\nwhich is the identity on X as a topological space and is the map x 7\u2192 xp on the structure sheaf OX .\n5There are several subtleties involving base change and defining the absolute Frobenius, so the reader\nshould take this statement with a grain of salt.\n6In the Connes-Kreimer theory, the coproduct of H gives a recursive formula for the factorization of\nloops in the prounipotent complex Lie group G(C) := Hom(H, C). The Birkhoff factorization of \u03c6 as\nalgebra homomorphisms, needed for the counterterms, satisfy the Rota-Baxter identity.\n\n\f14\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\n\\\ni (X) = Hom(H i (X), K).\nwhere H\n4.1.3.

Cycle maps. Let C i (X) denote the free abelian group generated by closed irreducible subschemes of X of codimension i. In a Weil cohomology, there should be a group\nhomomorphism\ni\n\u03b3X\n: C i (X) \u2212\u2192 H 2i (X)\nsatisfying the following properties:\n(1) [Functoriality] There are two functorial conditions on cycle maps. The first (\"pull\nback\") goes as follows: Let r := dimX. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a morphism of\nSmProjk . Let C i (X) and C i (Y ) denote the group of cycles of codimension i on\nX and Y respectively. The following diagram commutes:\nf\u2217\n\nC i (Y ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C i (X)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03b3 i\n\uf8e6\n\u03b3Yi y\nyX\nf\u2217\n\nH 2i (Y ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H 2i (X)\n(The top map is a pull-back on cycles.)\nThe second functorial condition (\"push forward\") goes as follows: Let s :=\ndimY . Now consider the pull back map defined above: if\nf\u2217\n\nH 2i (Y ) \u2212\u2192 H 2i (X),\nthen by Poincar\u00e9 duality, we obtain the push-forward map\nf\u2217\n\nH 2r\u22122i (X) \u2212\u2192 H 2s\u22122i (Y )\nsuch that the following diagram commutes:\nf\u2217\n\nC r\u2212i (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C s\u2212i (X)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 s\u2212i\nr\u2212i \uf8e6\n\u03b3X\ny\u03b3Y\ny\nf\u2217\n\nH 2r\u22122i (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H 2s\u22122i (Y )\n(The map on the top denotes push-forward on cycles.)\ni+j\ni (Z) \u2297 \u03b3 j (W ).

Then the cycle map \u03b3P : C 0 \u2192 H 0 (P ) is the same\nas the inclusion of Z in K.\n4.1.5. Lefschetz theorems. There are two versions of the Lefschetz theorems, one \"weak\"\nand the other \"strong\". Let h : W \u2192 X be the inclusion of a smooth hyperplane section\nW of some smooth projective scheme X of dimension r.\n(1) [Weak Lefschetz] The induced map h\u2217 : H i (X) \u2192 H i (W ) is an isomorphism for\ni \u2264 r \u2212 2 and an injection for i = r \u2212 1.\n(2) [Hard Lefschetz] Define the Lefschetz operator\nL : H i (X) \u2192 H i+2 (X)\n1\nLx 7\u2192 x * \u03b3X\n(W ).\n\nThen for i \u2264 r, Lr\u2212i : H i (X) \u2212\u2192 H 2r\u2212i (X) is an isomorphism.\nIn summary: a Weil cohomology theory over k is a contravariant functor from the category\nSmProjk to the category GrVect with a nondegenerate pairing satisfying a Poincar\u00e9\nduality, with a K\u00fcnneth formula, with cycle maps that are functorial with respect to\npull-backs and push-forwards and satisfying the Lefschetz theorems.\n4.2. Some properties of cycle maps. There are two important properties of cycle maps\nin the context of pure motives.\n4.2.1. Intersection pairing and cup products. Let Z and W be two properly intersecting\ncycles in X and let Z \u2229 W denote the intersection pairing. Let \u2206 : X \u2192 X \u00d7 X be the\ndiagonal map. Then \u03b3X (Z \u2229 W ) = \u03b3X\u00d7X \u25e6 \u2206\u2217 (Z \u00d7 W ) where \u2206\u2217 denotes the pull-back of\nZ \u00d7W . We knew from the functoriality of cycle maps that this equals \u2206\u2217 \u25e6\u03b3X\u00d7X (Z \u00d7W ) =\n\u2206\u2217 (\u03b3X (Z) \u2297 \u03b3X (W )) by the multiplicativity of the cycle maps. So we get\n\u2206\u2217 (\u03b3X (Z) \u2297 \u03b3X (W )) = \u03b3X (Z) * \u03b3X (W )\nby applying pull-back again.\n4.2.2. Correspondences as operators. Let r := dimX. Observe from the definitions that\nH i (X \u00d7 Y ) = H i (X) \u2297 H i (Y )\n\\\n= H 2r\u2212i\n(X) \u2297 H i (Y )\n= Hom(H 2r\u2212i (X), K) \u2297 H i (Y )\n= Hom(H 2r\u2212i (X), H i (Y )).\nTherefore, we can view each element of H i (X \u00d7 Y ) as an operator from H 2r\u2212i (X) to\nH i (Y ). Such operators are called correspondences for the obvious reasons of section 5.\n4.3. The Standard Conjectures. The original formulation is in Grothendieck's Tata\nlecture [32]. I follow Murre's lecture [48].\nRescalling the indices in the hard Lefschetz theorem, the isomorphism can be equivalently written as Lr\u2212i : H r\u2212j (X) \u2192 H r+j for r = dimX. Using the map L we can define\na unique linear operator \u039b which makes the following: For 0 \u2264 j \u2264 r \u2212 2 the diagram\nLj\n\nH r\u2212j (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H r+j (X)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u039by\nyL\nLj+2\n\nH r\u2212j\u22122 (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H r+j+2 (X)\n\n\f16\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\ncommutes, and for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 r\nLj\u22122\n\nH r\u2212j+2 (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H r+j\u22122 (X)\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nL\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u039b\nLj\n\nH r\u2212j (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H r+j+2 (X)\n\nthe diagram commutes. We have\nConjecture 4.1 (B(X)). The operator \u039b is algebraic. That is\n\u2217\n\u039b(Z) = \u03b3X\u00d7X\n(Z) for all Z \u2208 CHi (X \u00d7 X) \u2297 Q.\n\nBy the hard Lefschetz theorem, we have the isomorphisms Lr\u2212i : H i (X) \u2192 H 2r\u2212i (X).\nLet\nP i (X) := ker{Lr\u2212i\u22121 : H i (X) \u2192 H 2r\u2212i+2 (X)}\nbe the set of primitive elements of H i (X). Let x, y \u2208 C i (X) \u2229 P 2i (X) for i \u2264 r/2.\nConjecture 4.2 (Hdg(X)). Consider the pairing\n(x, y) 7\u2192 (\u22121)i hLr\u22122i (x), yi\nwhere h\u2212, \u2212i denotes the cup product. This pairing is positive definite.\nIt is known that conjecture 4.2 is true for \u00e9tale cohomology in characteristic zero. (The\nfact that \u00e9tale cohomology is a Weil cohomology and that, in particular, the hard and\nweak Lefschetz theorems hold, requires some work to show.)\nConjectures 4.1 and 4.2 taken together imply the Weil conjectures, among other things.\nOne cares about the standard conjectures because they capture something intrinsic about\nthe cycles independent of the Weil cohomology that the cycle map maps to. For example,\nwe have the following, due to Grothendieck:\nTheorem 4.3. Assume conjectures 4.1 and 4.2. Then the Betti numbers dimH i (X) is\nindependent on the choice of X.\n5. Classical motives\nAs noted in the introduction, one of the central goal of theory of motives is linearization\nof the category of algebraic varieties (or schemes) over an arbitrary base field (or ring).\nIn fact, what we are after is obtaining something stronger than additivity (which is the\n\"coarsest\" form of linearization)\u2013 we want an abelianization of the category of algebraic\nvarieties! One way to abelianize the category of varieties is to replace morphisms in this\ncategory by correspondences.\n5.1. Correspondences of curves. By a curve, we mean a nonsingular variety of dimension 1. Let us start with the case of correspondences of curves over the complex numbers\n(classical theory due to Castelnuovo and Severi).\nDefinition 5.1 (section 2.5 of [30]). Let C and C \u2032 be two curves. A correspondence of\ndegree d between C and C \u2032 is a holomorphic map\nT : C \u2192 C \u2032 , p 7\u2192 T (p)\nwhere T (p) a divisor of degree d on C. Furthermore, the curve of correspondence between\nC and C \u2032 is given by the curve\nD = {(p, q)|q \u2208 T (p)} \u2282 C \u00d7 C \u2032 .\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n17\n\nLet D \u2282 C \u00d7 C \u2032 be a curve. Then the correspondence associated to D is defined by\nT (p) = \u03c0p\u2217 (D) \u2208 Div(C \u2032 )\nwhere \u03c0p\u2217 : C \u2032 \u2192 C \u00d7 C \u2032 is given by q 7\u2192 (p, q).\nRemark 5.2. The \"converse\" part of definition (5.1) states that we should view correspondences as formal linear combinations of all 0-dimensional subvarieties on C \u2032 .\n5.2. Equivalence relations on algebraic cycles. All through we will work with smooth\nprojective varieties over a field k. We denote the category of such objects as SmProjk .\nFurthermore, most of the time, we'd restrict ourselves to such varieties that are also\nirreducible. Much of the material in this section (and the next) is from the excellent\nreviews by Murre [48] and Scholl [55]. Recall\nDefinition 5.3. An algebraic cycle Z on X of codimension i is a formal linear combination\nof closed irreducible subvarieties Z\u03b1 of codimension i; thus,\nX\nZ=\nn\u03b1 Z\u03b1 , n\u03b1 \u2208 Z.\n\u03b1\n\nAlgebraic cycles (or cycles, for short) of a given codimension i in a given smooth projective X form an abelian group with repect to formal sums. Denote such a group as\nZ i (X). As it stands, Z i (X) is very \"big\", so we want to obtain a smaller group by taking\na quotient of Z i (X) by equivalence relations on cycles.\nThere are several equivalence relations that one can impose on cycles, but we'd restrict\nourselves to the following.\n(1) (Rational equivalence) Let Z be a cycle of a fixed codimension i on X irreducible\nof dimension d. We say Z is rationally equivalent to zero and write Z \u223crat 0 if\nthere exists (Y\u03b1 , f\u03b1 ) withPY\u03b1 irreducible of codimension i \u2212 1 and f\u03b1 a rational\nfunction on Y\u03b1 such that \u03b1 vY\u03b1 (f\u03b1 )Y\u03b1 = Z. (Here v denotes the valuation of the\nrational function.)\n(2) (Homological equivalence) Once again, let Z be a cycle of codimension i. Let\n\u2217 (X, Q) be the Betti cohomology of X. Then there exists a map (in fact a group\nHB\n2i (X, Q). We\nhomomorphism!) Z 7\u2192 [Z] where [Z] is a cohomology class in HB\nsay that Z is homologically equivalent to zero and write Z \u223chom 0 if the image\nof Z under this map vanishes. Furthermore, cycle maps are general gadgets that\nassociate i-cycles to 2i-cohomology classes in any good cohomology theory (not\njust Betti) and statisfying certain functorialilty conditions, a notion formalized by\nWeil cohomology, see 4.1. Homological equivalence is a notion that is to hold true\nin any (and perhaps more strongly in all) of these good cohomology theories.\n(3) (Numerical equivalence) Let Z as in above. We say Z is numerically equivalent to\nzero and write Z \u223cnum 0 if the intersection number #(Z \u2229 Z \u2032 ) = 0 for all Z \u2032 cycles\nof the same codimension as Z. (To spell things out\nsays\nP a bit more: the definition\nP\nthat #(Z\u03b1 \u2229 Z\u03b2\u2032 ) = 0 for all \u03b1, \u03b2 and where Z = \u03b1 n\u03b1 Z\u03b1 and Z \u2032 = \u03b2 n\u03b2 Z\u03b2\u2032 .)\nIt can seen that the relations given above are indeed equivalence relations. From now\non, we would write \u223c to mean any of three relations above unless we fix the equivalence\nrelation, in which case we would specify it as such.\nDefinition 5.4. Fix a smooth projective variety X. The group\ni\ni\nC\u223c\n(X) := Z i (X)/Z\u223c\n(X)\ni (X) denotes the subgroup of cycles identified under the equivalence relation\nwhere Z\u223c\ni (X). When \u223c=\u223c\n\u223c. When X is irreducible and of dimension d, C\u223c (X) := \u2295di=0 C\u223c\nhom ,\n\n\f18\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\ni (X) is called the Chow group and is denoted as CH i (X). Notation: we write C (X)\nC\u223c\n\u223c\nQ\nto mean C\u223c (X) \u2297 Q.\n\nRemark 5.5. Notice that (1) is just a generalization of the notion of divisors on curves\nand that of linear equivalence. The relation (3) is tricker because the interesction pairing\nZ \u2229 Z \u2032 may not be always defined. In this case, one resorts to various moving lemmas.\nPerhaps the most problematic is the equivalence relation (2) since the definition is based\non a choice of a cohomology theory; however assuming one of the implications of the\nStandard conjectures along with Jannsen's result help solving this problem (see theorem\n5.13.)\nAn important observation is\ni\ni\ni\ni\nC\u223c\n(X) \u2286 C\u223c\n(X) \u2286 C\u223c\n(X) \u2282 C\u223c\n(X)\nrat\nnum\nhom\n\ngoing from the finest to the coarsest equivalence relations on cycles. An extremely important conjecture in the theory of classical motives is\nConjecture 5.6 (Fundamental Conjecture D(X)).\ni\ni\n(X).\n(X) = C\u223c\nC\u223c\nnum\nhom\n\nThe conjecture 5.6 follows from the Standard Conjectures of Grothendieck B(X) (conjecture 4.1) and Hdg(X) (conjecture 4.2).\n5.3. Pure motives. Just like in the case of curves (see definition (5.1), we view correspondences on a smooth projective variety as formal linear combinations of closed irreducible\nsubvarieties, i.e, as elements in group of correspondences C\u223c (X \u00d7 Y )Q =: Corr\u223c (X, Y ).\nLet f \u2208 Corr\u223c (X, Y ) and g \u2208 Corr\u223c (Y, Z). The composition of correspondences is\ngiven by\ng \u2022 f = prXZ ((f \u00d7 Z) * (X \u00d7 g)).\nA emphprojector p \u2208 Corr0\u223c (X, X) is an idempotent p \u2022 p = p.\nDefinition 5.7 (the category of effective pure motives). Fix an equivalence relation on\ncycles \u223c. The category of effective pure motives over a field k is denoted as Mot+\n\u223c (k) has\n\u2022 Objects: (X, p) where X \u2208 Obj (SmProjk ) and p a projector.\n\u2022 Morphisms: Let M = (X, p) and N = (Y, q). Then HomMot+\n(M, N ) := q \u2022\n\u223c (k)\n0\nCorr\u223c (X, Y ) \u2022 p.\nElements of HomMot+\n(M, N ) are simply the composition of correspondences X \u2192\n\u223c (k)\nX \u2192 Y \u2192 Y . By modifying the definition 5.7 to allow for Tate twists, we get the category\nof virtual pure motives over k.\nDefinition 5.8 (the category of virtual pure motives). The category of virtual pure\nmotives over a field k is denoted as Mot\u223c (k) has\n\u2022 Objects: (X, p, m) where X and p as above and m = dimX.\n\u2022 Morphisms: Let M = (X, p, m) and N = (Y, q, n) (and n = dimY ).

Fix an equivalence relation \u223c on the cycles\nof X. Let M be a virtual pure motives of a smooth projective variety X, i.e, M = m\u223c (X).\nDefinition 5.10 (Realization of a pure motive).

We have the following \"fundamental theorem of pure motives\":\nTheorem 5.11. Mothom (k) can be realized for all Weil cohomologies and is neutral Tannakian with the fiber functor real.\nThis is the reason why number theorists often use the term \"motive of X\" when they\nmean \"the l-adic cohomology of X with Ql -coffecients and a continuous Gk action on it\".\n(The action of Gk is through the motivic Galois group of X, cf. section 5.5.)\nRecall the yoga of Tannakian formalism of section 3. Deligne defines the dimension of\nan object in a rigid tensor category C in the following way:\nDefinition 5.12 (dimension). Let I be the unit object in C.

The Standard Conjectures imply that\ndimM is independent of the choice of the Weil cohomology.\nTheorem 5.13 (Jannsen). The category Motnum (k) is semisimple and abelian.\n5.5. Motivic Galois groups.

In most physical applications\nof the theory of motives, most notably in the case of the motives of hypersurfaces associated to Feynman graphs in perturbative quantum field theory, working with smooth\nprojective varieties is too restrictive. In fact, one knows that the projective hypersurfaces\nobtained from the parametric form of Feynman integrals are typically singular, and this\nalready leaves the world of pure motives. Moreover, since the parametric Feynman integral (see the appendix) is computed over a domain of integration with boundary, what\nis involved from the motivic point of view is really a relative cohomology of the hypersurface complement, relative to a normal crossings divisor that contains the boundary of\nthe domain of integration. This is a second reason why it is mixed motives and not pure\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n21\n\nmotives that are involved, since these are the natural environment where long exact cohomology sequences and relative cohomologies live. Unfortunately, from the mathematical\npoint of view, the theory of mixed motives is far more complicated than that of pure\nmotives. At present, one only has a triangulated category of mixed motives, with various\nequivalent constructions due to Voevodsky, Levine, and Hanamura. Only in very special\ncases, such as mixed Tate motives over a number field, it is possible to construct and\nabelian category. While we are not going to give any details on the construction of the\ntriangulated category of mixed motives, we recall the relevant cohomological properties\nand some properties of their analytic counterpart, mixed Hodge structures. We also recall\nsome preliminary notions about triangulated categories to aid the reader in her further\nstudy.\n6.1. Derived and triangulated categories. 7 This material is taken from Dimca [23].\nLet Ab be an abelian category. Let C(Ab) be the category of complexes in Ab. (The\nreader unfamiliar with homological algebra should immediately set Ab to be the category\nof R-modules ModR .) C(Ab) contains three important full subcategories C \u2022 (Ab):\n(1) C + (Ab) of complexes bounded on the left:\n* * * \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 A\u22121 \u2212\u2192 A0 \u2212\u2192 * * *\n(2) C \u2212 (Ab) of complexes bounded on the right:\n* * * \u2212\u2192 A0 \u2212\u2192 A1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 * * *\n(3) C b (Ab) the full subcategory of complexes bounded both on the right and the left.\nLet X \u2022 , Y \u2022 be two complexes in C \u2022 (Ab). Call the morphism u : X \u2022 \u2192 Y \u2022 a quasiisomorphism if at the level of cohomology H k (u) : H k (X \u2022 ) \u2192 H k (Y \u2022 ) is an isomorphism\nfor all k.\nDefine a shift automorphism on complexes T : C \u2022 \u2192 C \u2022 as\n(X[n])r := X n+r ,\ndsT (X \u2022 ) := \u2212ds+1\nX\u2022\nfor the complex\ndm+1\n\ndm\n\ndm\u22121\n\nA\u2022 : * * * \u2212\u2192 Am\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Am \u2212\u2192 Am+1 \u2212\u2192 * * *\nLet u : X \u2022 \u2192 Y \u2022 be a morphism of complexes in C \u2022 (Ab). The mapping cone of the\nmorphism u is the complex in C \u2022 (Ab) given by\nCu\u2022 = Y \u2022 \u2295 (X \u2022 [1]).\nThis gives rise to the standard triangle for a morphism u\nu\n\nq\n\np\n\nTu : X \u2022 \u2212\u2192 Y \u2022 \u2212\u2192 Cu\u2022 \u2212\u2192 X \u2022 [1],\nwhere q (resp. p) is the inclusion (resp. projection) morphisms. The standard triangle\ngives rise to long exact sequences in cohomology.\nAn important construction is that of a homotopic category8. This is an additive category\n\u2022\nK (Ab) with\n\u2022 Obj (K \u2022 (Ab)) = Obj (C \u2022 (Ab)),\n\u2022 HomK \u2022 (Ab) (X \u2022 , Y \u2022 ) = Hom(X \u2022 , Y \u2022 )/ \u223c where \u223c is homotopy equivalence: u \u223c\nv =\u21d2 H k (u) = H k (v).\n7Because of the rather dry and technical nature of the precise definitions, I have tried to give a more\ngeneral idea about triangulated and derived categories; the following are a collection of concepts as oppossed\nto a list of formal definitions and properties.\n8The reader is invited to compare this with the definition of a Grothendieck group in 2.2.\n\n\f22\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\nA family of triangles in K \u2022 (Ab) is distinguished if they are isomorphic to a standard\ntriangle for some morphism u.\nIn a homotopic category K \u2022 (Ab), distinguished triangles satisfy a list of four properties\nreferred to as TR1\u2013TR4 in the literature. We will not repeat them here (see, for example,\nproposition 1.2.4 of [23]). It suffices to say that TR1\u2013TR4 guarantees nice functorial\nproperties of distinguished triangles, compatible with homotopy.\nA triangulated category is an additive category A with a shift self-equivalence T , with\nX[1] = T X and with a collection of distinguished triangles T that satisfy TR1\u2013TR4 in\nthe original definition due to Verdier. A derived category D \u2022 (Ab) of an abelian category\nAb is a triangulated category obtained from K \u2022 (Ab) by localization with respect to the\nmultiplicative system of quasi-isomorphisms in K \u2022 (Ab).\n6.2.

Hodge structures. Let us quickly review the basic definitions of Hodge theory.\nDefinition 6.5 (Pure Hodge structure). A pure Hodge structure of weight m on a finite\ndimensional vector space V is a decreasing filtration\n* * * \u2282 F p+1 VC \u2282 F p VC \u2282 * * *\nwith VC := V \u2297R C and satisfying the Hodge decomposition\nVC = \u2295p+q=m V p,q ,\nwhere V p,q = F p \u2229 F p VC and denotes the conjugate filtration.\nHodge structures form a category Hodge with morphisms of vector spaces compatible\nwith the filtration F making up the hom set. The category Hodge is a tensor category\nwith the evident tensor product. Furthermore, by taking formal differences of Hodge\nstructures [H] \u2212 [H \u2032 ], we obtain the Grothendieck ring of Hodge structures K(Hodge).\nLet A \u2282 R. An A-mixed Hodge structure consists of the following data:\n(1) An A-module of finite type VA .\n(2) An increasing filtration called the weight filtration\n* * * \u2282 Wn \u2282 Wn+1 \u2282 * * *\nof A \u2297 Q-module VA \u2297 Q.\n(3) A decreasing filtration called the Hodge filtration\n* * * F p+1 VC \u2282 F p VC \u2282 * * *\nwhere VC \u2297 VA \u2297 C.\n(4) A graded weight j factor grW\nj (VA ) := (Wj /Wj\u22121 ) \u2297 C with a pure Hodge struture\ninduced by the filtration F and F on VC .\nMixed Hodge structures too form a category MHodge with morphisms VA \u2192 VA\u2032 Amodule homomorphisms that are compatible with the Hodge and weight filtrations.

Mixed Tate motives can be defined\nas the triangulated subcategory of the triangulated category of mixed motives generated\nby the Tate objects Q(n). Over a number field, however, it is possible to obtain a nicer\ncategory in the following way.\nLet k be a number field. Let Q(1) be the pure Tate motive. The category of mixed\nTate motives over k, denoted as MTMotk is constructed in the following way. Consider\nthe simple objects Q(n) and assume that Q(a) and Q(b) are isomorphic for a 6= b and that\nany simple object of MTMotk is isomorphic to some Q(*). Also consider the groups\nExtiMTMotk (Q(0), Q(n))\nand assume that they vanish for i > 1. An important result of Borel identifies these\nextensions:\nTheorem 6.7 (Borel). Ext1MTMotk (Q(0), Q(n)) \u2243 K2n\u22121 (k) \u2297 Q where K2n\u22121 (k) is the\nQuillen K-theory of the field k.\nNow K2n\u22121 (k) \u2297 Q = H\u2022 (GL(n, k)), the linear group with entries in k, so the reader\nmay think of the Quillen K-theory in this case in terms of this homological identification.\nWe have the following fundamental theorem:\nTheorem 6.8 (Deligne\u2013Goncharov). The category MTMotk for a number field k is a\nTannakian category with objects Q(n) and the extensions described above. Furthermore,\nthe Hodge realization functor MTMotk \u2192 MHodge is exact and faithful.\n7. Motivic measures and zeta functions\nThe material for this section is based on [22] and [35].\n7.1. Overview of basics. The generalized Euler characteristic \u03c7 associates to each object\nin Vark an element in a fixed commutative ring R such that \u03c7(X) = \u03c7(Y ) for X \u2243 Y and\n\u03c7(X) = \u03c7(Y ) + \u03c7(X \\ Y ) for a closed subvariety Y \u2282 X. The product in R is given by\nthe fibered product of varieties: \u03c7(X \u00d7 Y ) = \u03c7(X)\u03c7(Y ). In fact the Euler characteristic\nis the canonical example of a generalized Euler characteristic.\nKonstevich's original motivation behind inventing motivic measures was to prove the\nfollowing theorem\nTheorem 7.1 (Kontsevich). Let X and Y be two birationally equivalent Calabi-Yau manifolds. Then X and Y have the same Hodge numbers.\nThese types of questions are of enormous importance for duality questions in string\ntheory, namely in mirror symmetry. (There is a beautiful theory around this called the\ngeometric McKay correspondence which I completely omit from the discussion.)\nAn example, following the proof of this theorem of Kontsevich, of a generalized Euler\ncharacteristic, comes from Hodge numbers of a complex manifold X. Recall the definition\nof mixed Hodge structures. For a Hodge structure V , we can define the P\nclass of V in\nK(Hodge) in terms of the graded m-factors in the weight filtration: [V ] := m [grW\nm (V )].\nDefine the Hodge-Deligne polynomial as\nX\n\u03c7h (X) :=\n[Hci (X, Q)] \u2208 K(Hodge)\ni\n\nHci (X, Q)\n\nis the i-th cohomology of X with compact support. If Y \u2282 X is locally\nwhere\nclosed, then the Hodge characteristic is compatible with the exact Gysin sequence:\n* * * \u2212\u2192 Hcr (X \\ Y, Q) \u2212\u2192 Hcr (X, Q) \u2212\u2192 Hcr (Y, Q) \u2212\u2192 Hcr+1 (X \\ Y, Q) \u2212\u2192 * * * .\n\n\f26\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\nThat is\n\u03c7h (X) = \u03c7h (Y ) + \u03c7h (X \\ Y ).\nRemark 7.2. For X the affine line A1k , Hcr (A1k , Q) = 0 for all r 6= 2 and Hc2 (A1k , Q) is\none-dimensional of Hodge type (1, 1). So \u03c7h (A1k ) is invertible. This is the Lefschetz motive\nL.\nWe have the following two ring homomorphisms\n\u2022 [Hodge characteristic]\n\u03c7h : K(Hodge) \u2192 Z[u, u\u22121 , v, v \u22121 ]\nX\nH i (X, Q) 7\u2192\ndim(H p,q (X, Q))up v q\np+q=i\n\n\u2022 [Weight characteristic]\n\u03c7wt : K(Hodge) \u2192 Z[w, w\u22121 ]\nu, v 7\u2192 w.\nHere H p,q (X, Q) is the (p, q)-th piece of Hci (X, Q).

Arc spaces. Let k be a field of characteristic zero and let X be a variety over\nk. For all natural numbers n, we define the arc space Ln (X) as an algebraic variety\nover k whose k-rational points are K[t]/tn+1 -rational points for some k \u2282 K. We set\nL(X) = lim Ln (X). Note that L0 (X) = X and L1 (X) = T X, the (Zariski) tangent space\n\u2190\u2212\nn\nof X. We call the K-rational points of Ln (X) K-arcs of X or arcs for short.

Let X be a variety over k (which, I remind the reader is\na separated scheme of finite type over k.) Denote by L(X) the scheme of germs of arcs\non X. It is a defined as a scheme over k such that, for any extension k \u2282 K there is a\nnatural bijection\nL(X)(K) \u2243 HomSchk (Spec k[[t]], K)\nThe scheme L(X) := lim Ln (X) in the category of schemes Ln (X) representing the functor\n\u2190\n\u2212\nn\nR 7\u2192 HomSchk (Spec R[t]/tn+1 , X)\ndefined on the category of K-algebras.\nNot much is known about the space L(X). An important result is the following:\nProposition 7.6 (Kolchin). Let X be an integral scheme. Then L(X) is irreducible.\n7.4. The Nash Problem. Arcs were first introduced by Nash in connection with singularities: let P be a singular point on X and set L{P } (X) := \u03c00\u22121 (P ) of arcs with origin\nP . He studied the space N{P } (X) \u2282 L{P } (X) of arcs not contained in the singular locus\nSing X. Let me briefly sketch Nash's beautiful idea, following Loeser's Trieste lectures\n[36].\n\u03c1\nLet Y \u2192 X be a resolution of singularities of a scheme X. Recall that this means:\nY is smooth, \u03c1 is proper and \u03c1 induces an isomorphism Y \\ \u03c1\u22121 (Sing X) \u2243 X \\ Sing X.\nWe say that the resolution of singularities is divisorial if the locus E where \u03c1 is not a\nlocal isomorphism (called the exceptional set) is a divisor in Y . In such cases, we call the\n\u03c1\u2032\n\nlocus an exceptional divisor. Let Y \u2032 \u2192 X be another proper birational morphism (and\nassume that X is normal) and let p be the generic point of E. We say that E appears in\n\u03c1\u2032 if \u03c1\u2032 \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c1 is a local isomorphism at p. The exceptional divisor E is called an essential\ncomponent of a resolution of X if E appears in every divisorial resolution of X. Denote\nthe set of essential components as C{P } (X).\n\u03bd\n\nTheorem 7.7 (Nash). The mapping C{P } (X) \u2212\u2192 N{P } (X) is injective.\nBasically, what this theorem tells is that every irreducible component of L(X) through\na singularity P corresponds to an exceptional divisor that occurs on every resolution. The\nNash Problem asks\nQuestion 7.8. For what X is the map \u03bd a bijection?\nAn explicit nonexample was provided by Ishii-Koll\u00e1r when X is a 4-dimensional hypersurface singularity {(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) \u2208 A5k |x31 + x32 + x33 + x34 + x65 = 0} which has 1\nirreducible family of arcs but 2 essential components.

The motivic zeta function Z(T ) in definition 7.11 is a\nrational function.\nAppendix A. Motivic ideas in physics (by M.Marcolli)\nThe theory of motives was introduced to mathematicians by Grothendieck as a universal\ncohomology theory for algebraic varieties. At present, while a lot of progress happened\nsince its origin, it is still a field in very rapid development, with a wealth of intriguing\nconjectures still unsolved and new unexpected applications being found. Among these,\nmotives recently made their appearance in the world of theoretical physics, a latecomer\nwith respect to more traditional mathematical tools adopted by the physics community,\nbut one that is likely to lead to a wider range of future applications. We attempt here to\nconvince our audience that, in various forms, some of the main ingredients of the theory\nof motives have already penetrated the horizon of the high-energy physics community.\nRoughly speaking, the theory of motives encompasses an analytic side, which is based on\nHodge theory and mixed Hodge structures, a geometric side based on algebraic varieties\nand algebraic cycles, and an algebraic side coming from algebraic K-theory. This appendix\nwill recall briefly some contexts familiar to theoretical physics where these notions have\ncome play an important role. We will try to focus not only on the setting of perturbative\nscalar quantum field theories and the parametric representation of Feynman integrals,\nwhich is one of the main interactions between physics and motives of interest today, but\nalso on other occurrences of some of the main motivic ideas in other aspects of theoretical\nphysics.\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n29\n\nA.1. The dawn of motives in physics. One can trace the origin of motivic ideas in\nphysics to the theory of electromagnetism and the \"cohomological\" interpretation of the\nMaxwell equations in terms of differential forms. In fact, electromagnetism is the historic\norigin of Hodge theory, which in turn is on of the essential building blocks of the theory\nof motives. Naturally, the current ideas on mixed Hodge structures are a long distance\naway from the Maxwell equations, but as we discuss briefly below, ideas related to Hodge\ntheory continued to play a role in physics beyond electromagnetism, most notably in the\nmore recent context of mirror symmetry. On the other hand, periods of algebraic varieties,\nanother important aspect of the theory of motives, have made repeated appearances in\nthe context of theoretical physics, from their role in residues of Feynman graphs, which\nis being extensively investigated today, to the modeling of spectral density functions in\ncondensed matter physics.\nA.2. Hodge theory: from electromagnetism to mirror symmetry. An important\nway in which some motivic ideas make contact with the world of physics is through Hodge\ntheory. In fact, the very origin of Hodge theory is in the formulation of Maxwell's equations\nof electromagnetism. In terms of electric and magnetic fields, these are usually written in\nthe form\n\uf8f1\n\u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2202B\n\uf8f4\n\u2202t\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2207 \u00d7 B = \u2212 \u2202E\n\u2202t\n(1)\n\uf8f4\ndiv E = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ndiv B = 0,\n\nwith E = (Ex , Ey , Ez ) and B = (Bx , By , Bz ). One can better assemble the electric and\nmagnetic field in a single entity, described by a 2-form\nF = (Ex dx + Ey dy + Ez dz) \u2227 dt + Bx dy \u2227 dz \u2212 By dx \u2227 dz + Bz dx \u2227 dy.\nThe advantage of this formulation is that it transforms the Maxwell equations (1) into the\nmuch more appealing and conceptually simple form\n(\ndF = 0\n(2)\nd\u2217 F = 0,\nwhere d is the deRham differential with adjoint d\u2217 . See the beautiful paper of Raoul\nBott [14] for a more detailed discussion of these and other examples of geometrization of\nphysics.\nThis formulation of the Maxwell equations leads immediately to considerations on the\nHodge decomposition of differential forms \u03c9 = d\u03b1 + d\u2217 \u03b2 + \u03b3, with \u03b3 harmonic, satisfying\nd\u03b3 = d\u2217 \u03b3 = 0 as above. The identification of deRham cohomology with harminic forms,\nin turn, relates then to the Hodge decomposition of the cohomology of compact K\u00e4hler\nmanifolds\nH k (X, C) = \u2295p+q=k H p,q (X),\nwhich is the origin of the notion of Hodge structures as the \"analytic side\" of the theory\nof motives of algebraic varieties.\nIn this more refined form, Hodge theory made a spectacular return into the world\nof theoretical physics with the discovery of mirror symmetry. This originated with the\nobservation that certain Calabi-Yau threefolds, which serve as compactified dimensions in\nstring theory, form mirror pairs when their \u03c3-models determine the same superconformal\nfield theory. In particular, it was observed that two such mirror varieties X and X \u2032 , while\n\n\f30\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\ngeometrically very different, have a very simple \"mirror relation\" between their Hodge\nnumbers\n(3)\n\nhp,q (X) = h3\u2212p,q (X \u2032 ),\n\nwhere hp,q (X) = dimH p,q (X). From this initial observation the field of mirror symmetry rapidly developed into an extremely interesting and elaborate branch of contemporary mathematical physics, where several sophisticated ideas from algebraic geometry and\narithmetic geometry, including various aspects of the theory of motives such as algebraic\ncycles, came to play an increasingly important role.\nA.3. Algebraic cycles and homological mirror symmetry. The main way in which\nalgebraic cycles came to play a role in the more recent developments of homological mirror\nsymmetry (see [38]) is through the fact that they define objects in the bounded derived\ncategory D b (X) of coherent sheaves. For a variety of general type that is realized as a\ncomplete intersection in a toric variety, homological mirror symmetry predicts that the\nderived category D b (X) can be realized as a subcategory of the Fukaya\u2013Seidel category\nF (Y, W ) of a mirror Landau\u2013Ginzburg model specified by a symplectic manifold Y with\na superpotential W . As shown in [38], using this approach one can transform questions\nabout algebraic cycles into corresponding questions in the mirror environment, typically in\nterms of the information associated to the singularities of W . This point of view may prove\nvery useful from the motivic viewpoint. In fact, one of the main source of difficulties in the\ntheory of motives is the fact that questions about algebraic cycles are extremely difficult\nto approach, which is the reason why Grothendieck's\"standard conjectures\" on motives\nremain unsolved. One can, potentially, at least in some cases, employ the homological\nmirror symmetry viepoint to relate such questions, as in [38], to constructions involving\nvanishing cycles and singularity theory in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model.\nA.4. Algebraic varieties and periods: Fermi surfaces. Periods are a very interesting\nclass of complex numbers, which are in general not algebraic, but which can be obtained\nvia a geometric procedure where all the objects involved are themselves algebraic. More\nprecisely, these are numbers that are obtained by integrating an algebraic differential form\nover a cycle in an algebraic variety. For the purpose of our setting here, we can assume\nthat the varieties themselves are defined over Q (or more generally a finite extension, a\nnumber field) and so are the algebraic differential forms, while the domain of integration is\na cycle defined again over the same field. One also allows for the case where the domain of\nintegration has boundary, in which case it is defined by inequalities, as a semi-algebraic set,\nagain over the same field, and in this case the integration of a differential form correspond\nto a pairing with a relative cohomology group. We'll see this in more explicit examples\nlater. There are relations between periods coming from change of variables in the integrals\nthat compute them and from the Stokes formula. The properties, known and conjectural,\nof the algebra of periods are analyzed in detail in the paper of Kontsevich\u2013Zagier [39].\nThe type of numbers that one obtains as periods can be used as numerical signatures of\nthe motivic complexity of the algebraic variety. For example, multiple zeta values are the\ntell-tale sign of the presence of a particular class of motives, the mixed Tate motive, about\nwhich more later.\nA first beautiful example of the role of periods of algebraic varieties arises in the context of Fermi surfaces in condensed matter, see [28], [29], [50]. One considers electrons\nmoving in a lattice, in the independent electron approximation, where one can describe\nthe dynamics as a single particle model with an effective potential. The energy levels of\nthe system are obtained from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n(4)\n\n(\u2212\u2206 + V )\u03c8 = \u03bb\u03c8,\n\nwith\n\n\u03c8(x + \u03b3) = eihk,\u03b3i \u03c8(x),\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n31\n\nfor a fixed k \u2208 Rd and for all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, the lattice of ions.

In these geometric terms,\none then describes the Fermi surface in terms of the Bloch variety\n(6)\n\nB(V ) = {(\u03be, \u03bb) \u2208 (C\u2217 )d \u00d7 C | \u2203\u03c8 solution of (5)}.\n\nThe Fermi surface F\u03bb is obtained from the Bloch variety as the fiber F\u03bb = \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03bb) of the\nprojection \u03c0 : B(V ) \u2192 C. This is an algebraic variety, from which one can read physical\nproperties of the system. One of the main results of [28] is the fact that the density of\nstates \u03c1(\u03bb) of the system can be computed as a period of this algebraic variety in the form\nZ\n1\nd\u03c1\n\u03c9\u03bb ,\n=\n(7)\nd\u03bb\n(2\u03c0)d a1 * * * ad F\u03bb \u2229(S 1 )d\nwhere the domain of integration are the real points of the Fermi surface F\u03bb and the\nalgebraic differential form is defined by the relation\n\u03c0 \u2217 (d\u03bb) \u2227 \u03c9\u03bb =\n\nd\u03bed\nd\u03be1\n\u2227 *** \u2227\n.\n\u03be1\n\u03bed\n\nAlthough the algebro-geometric properties of the Bloch varieties and Fermi surfaces have\nbeen studied extensively in [28], there has been so far no explicitly motivic analysis of\nthis family of varieties and of the corresponding periods. A notable exception is the paper\nof Steinstra [57], which gives a motivic interpretation of the period in terms of Deligne\ncohomology and Mahler measures, in the case of zero potential. One can expect that a\nmore extensive analysis of the motivic properties of Bloch varieties and Fermi surfaces will\nlead to interesting results, in the same vein and with similar techniques as those adopted\nin the study of the motivic aspects of Feynman integrals described here below.\nA.5. The parametric form of Feynman integrals. Another example of the role in\nphysics of periods of algebraic varieties, which is presently being widely investigated, is\nthat of parametric Feynman integrals of perturbative scalar quantum field theories.\nIn perturbative quantum field theory, to a scalar field theory with Euclidean Lagrangian\nof the form\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\nm2 2\n1\n2\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6) +\n\u03c6 + P(\u03c6) dv,\n(8)\nL(\u03c6) =\n2\n2\n\nwith the interaction term given by a polynomial P(\u03c6), one assigns a formal perturbative\nexpansion\nX U (\u0393, p1 , . . . , pN )\n\u0393\n\n#Aut(\u0393)\n\nparameterized by Feynman graphs \u0393. These are finite graphs with internal edges connecting pairs of vertices and external edges attached to a single vertex and carrying extrernal\nmomenta pi . The vertices are constrained to have valences equal to the powers of the\nmonomials in P(\u03c6). The contribution U (\u0393, p1 , . . . , pN ) is dictated by the Feynman rules\n\n\f32\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\nof the theory, and can be expressed as a (typically divergent) finite dimensional integral.\nIn the parametric form (or \u03b1-parametrization) these integrals can be written in the form\nZ\n\u0393(n \u2212 Dl\nP\u0393 (t, p)\u2212n+Dl/2 \u03c9n\n2 )\n,\n(9)\nU (\u0393, p1 , . . . , pN ) =\n(4\u03c0)Dl/2 \u03c3n \u03a8\u0393 (t)\u2212n+D(l+1)/2\n\nwherePn = #Eint (\u0393) and l = b1 (\u0393). The domain of integration is the simplex \u03c3n = {t \u2208\nRn+ | i ti = 1}. The Kirchhoff polynomial (also called first Symanzik polynomial) \u03a8\u0393 (t)\nis given by\nX Y\n(10)\n\u03a8\u0393 (t) =\nte ,\nT \u2282\u0393 e\u2208E(T\n/\n)\n\nwhere the sum is over all the spanning trees (forests) T of the graph \u0393 and for each\nspanning tree the product is over all edges of \u0393 that are not in the tree. The second\nSymanzik polynomial P\u0393 (t, p) is similarly defined in terms of cut sets instead of spanning\ntrees, and it depends explicitly on the external momenta of the graph (see [7] \u00a718). The\npolynomial \u03a8\u0393 (t) is homogeneous of degree l = b1 (\u0393), while, in the massless case, the\npolynomial P\u0393 (t, p) is homogeneous of degree l + 1.\nAfter removing the divergent Gamma factor from (9), one is left with the residue of the\nFeynman integral, which has then the form of a period, in the sense that it is the integration\nof an algebraic differential form on a semi-algebraic set in the algebraic variety given by the\ncomplement of the hypersurface defined by the vanishing of the graph polynomial in the\ndemonimator of the integrand of (9). Saying that the integral is a period, of course, ignores\nthe important issue of divergences: in fact, even after removing the Gamma factor, the\nremaning integral can still contain divergences coming from the intersections of the domain\nof integration with the hypersurface. Modulo this issue, which needs to be addressed via a\nsuitable regularization and renormalization procedure, one is considering a period whose\nvalue contains information on the motivic nature of the relative cohomology\n(11)\n\nH n\u22121 (Pn\u22121 r X\u0393 , \u03a3n r (X\u0393 \u2229 \u03a3n )),\n\nwhere \u03a3n is the divisor of coordinate hyperplanes in Pn\u22121 , which contains the boundary\nof the domain of integration \u2202\u03c3n \u2282 \u03a3n . The frequent appearance of multiple zeta values\nin Feynman integral computations (see [15]) suggests that the cohomology (11) may be\na realization of a mixed Tate motive. However, [5] shows that the graph hypersurfaces\nX\u0393 themselves can be arbitrarily complex in motivic terms: their classes [X\u0393 ] span the\nGrothendieck ring of varieties. Understanding precise conditions on the graphs under\nwhich the Feynman integral gives a period of a mixed Tate motive is presently a very\ninteresting open question in the field.\nA.6. Motivic Galois groups in physics. A manifestation of motivic Galois groups in\nphysics arises in the context of the Connes\u2013Kreimer theory of perturbative renormalization. In [18] it was shown that the counterterms in the BPHZ renormalization procedure,\ndescribed as in Connes\u2013Kreimer in terms of Birkhoff factorization in the affine group\nscheme dual to the Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs, can be equivalently formulated in\nterms of solutions to a certain class of differential systems with irregular singularities. This\nis obtained by writing the terms in the Birkhoff factorization as time ordered exponentials,\nand then using the fact that\n\u221e Z\nRb\nX\n\u03b1(t) dt\na\nTe\n\u03b1(s1 ) * * * \u03b1(sn ) ds1 * * * dsn\n:= 1 +\nn=1 a\u2264s1 \u2264***\u2264sn \u2264b\n\nis the value g(b) at b of the unique solution g(t) \u2208 G with value g(a) = 1 of the differential\nequation dg(t) = g(t) \u03b1(t) dt.\n\n\fMOTIVES: AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY FOR PHYSICISTS\n\n33\n\nThe type of singularities are specified by physical conditions, such as the independence of\nthe counterterms on the mass scale. These conditions are expressed geometrically through\nthe notion of G-valued equisingular connections on a principal C\u2217 -bundle B over a disk \u2206,\nwhere G is the pro-unipotent Lie group of characters of the Connes\u2013Kreimer Hopf algebra\nof Feynman graphs. In physical terms, the disk \u2206 gives the complexified dimension of\ndimensional regularization of the Feynman integrals, while the fiber over z \u2208 \u2206 consists\nof the \u03bcz , with the parameter \u03bc giving the energy scale of the renormalization group flow.\nThe equisingularity condition is the property that such a connection \u03c9 is C\u2217 -invariant and\nthat its restrictions to sections of the principal bundle that agree at 0 \u2208 \u2206 are mutually\nequivalent, in the sense that they are related by a gauge transformation by a G-valued\nC\u2217 -invariant map regular in B, hence they have the same type of (irregular) singularity\nat the origin. The classification of equivalence classes of these differential systems can be\ndone via the Riemann\u2013Hilbert correspondence and differential Galois theory. This means\nassembling these data, in the form of a category of \"flat equisingular vector bundles\", which\none can show ([18]) is a Tannakian category. The Tannakian formalism then identifies it\nwith the category of finite dimensional linear representations of a Tannakian Galois group\nU \u2217 = U \u22ca Gm , where U is pro-unipotent with Lie algebra the free graded Lie algebra with\none generator e\u2212n in each degree n \u2208 N. The group U \u2217 is identified (non-canonically)\nwith the motivic Galois group of mixed Tate motives over the cyclotomic ring Z[e2\u03c0i/N ],\nfor N = 3 or N = 4, localized at N .\nA.7. Algebraic K-theory and conformal field theory. Algebraic K-theory, which\none can think of as the more algebraic manifestation of the theory of motives, may appear\nat first to be the part that is more remote from physics. On the contrary, it has come to\nplay an important role, for example in the context of conformal field theory. We mention\nhere very briefly some of the recent developments in this direction, while we refer the\nreader to [49] for a more informative overview.\nRecall that the dilogarithm is defined as\nZ 0\n\u221e\nX\nzn\nlog(1 \u2212 t)\ndt =\n.\nLi2 (z) =\nt\nn2\nz\nn=1\n\nIt satisfies the functional equation Li2 (z) + Li2 (1 \u2212 z) = Li2 (1) \u2212 log(z) log(1 \u2212 z), where\nLi2 (1) = \u03b6(2), for \u03b6(s) the Riemann zeta function. A variant is given by the Rogers\ndilogarithm\n1\nL(x) = Li2 (x) + log(x) log(1 \u2212 x).\n2\nSee [59] for a detailed survey on the dilogarithm and its properties.\nThere is a relation between the torsion elements in the algebraic K-theory group K3 (C)\nand rational conformally invariant quantum field theories in two dimensions, see [49].\nThere is, in fact, a map, given by the dilogarithm, from torsion elements in the Bloch group\n(closely related to the algebraic K-theory) to the central charges and scaling dimensions\nof the conformal field theories.\nThis correspondence arises by considering sums of the form\n(12)\n\nX q Q(m)\n,\n(q)m\nr\n\nm\u2208N\n\nwhere (q)m = (q)m1 * * * (q)mr , with (q)mi = (1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 q 2 ) * * * (1 \u2212 q mi ) and\nQ(m) = mt Am/2 + bm + h\n\n\f34\n\nABHIJNAN REJ (WITH AN APPENDIX BY MATILDE MARCOLLI)\n\nhas rational coefficients. Such sums are naturally obtained from considerations involving\nthe partition function of a bosonic rational CFT. In particular, (12) can define a modular\nfunction only if all the solutions of the equation\nX\n(13)\nAij log(xj ) = log(1 \u2212 xi )\nj\n\ndetermine elements of finite order in an extension B\u0302(C) of the Bloch group, which accounts\nfor the fact that the logarithm is multi-valued. The Rogers dilogarithm gives a natural\ngroup homomorphism (2\u03c0i)2 L : B\u0302(C) \u2192 C/Z, which takes values in Q/Z on the torsion\nelements. These values give the conformal dimensions of the fields in the theory.\nReferences\n[1] Paolo Aluffi, Matilde Marcolli Feynman motives of banana graphs (2008) arXiv:0801.1690v2 [hep-th]\n[2] Paolo Aluffi, Matilde Marcolli Algebro-geometric Feynman rules (2008) arXiv:0811.2514v1 [hep-th]\n[3] Paolo Aluffi, Matilde Marcolli Parametric Feynman integrals and determinant hypersurfaces (2009)\narXiv:0901.2107v1 [math.AG]\n[4] Yves Andr\u00e9 textitUne introduction aux motifs (motifs purs, motifs mixtes, p\u00e9riodes) Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nMath\u00e9matique de France, Paris, 2004.\n[5] Prakash Belkale, Patrick Brosnan Matroids, motives and a conjecture of Kontsevich Duke Math.
