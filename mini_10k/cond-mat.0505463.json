Both phenomena involve an opening up\nof a gap at the FS and hence lead to a reduction in the DOS at the FS below their respective transition temperatures. It is therfore of great interest to investigate the effect the\nSC and CDW have on each other when both happen to occur in the same system. Several\nsuch studies, both experimental [1, 2, 3] and theoretical [4, 5], have been undertaken in the\npast. However, most of these have been on systems with quasi-low-dimensional structures.\nRecently the compounds of the intermetallic series R5 Ir4 Si10 (R = rare earth) which have\nessentially a 3-dimensional structure provide an opportunity where either superconductivity\nand CDW ordering or magnetism and CDW ordering co-exist in the same material depending on whether the rare-earth element R is nonmagnetic or magnetic [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nThe compounds Lu5 Ir4 Si10 and Lu5 Ir4 Ge10 , like the other compounds of this series, crystallize in the tetragonal Sc5 Co4 Si10 (space group Pm3n) type structure. Lu5 Ir4 Si10 is known to\nsuperconduct below 3.9 K and it has also been shown to exhibit a strongly coupled charge\ndensity wave transition below TCDW = 83 K [6, 7, 8]. It has been shown that the CDW transition gets progressively suppressed to lower temperatures on the application of hydrostatic\npressure and is completely suppressed at a critical pressure of 21 kbar. There is a sudden\nenhancement of the superconducting transition temperature TSC from 3.9 K to 9 K at this\ncritical pressure [7]. This implies an intricate interplay and competition between the two\nphenomena. From heat capacity and susceptibility measurements, almost a 36% reduction\nin the density of states at the Fermi level due to the CDW transition has been estimated [7].\nThis observation was further supported by a\n\n175\n\nLu NMR measurement where an abrupt dip\n\nin the Knight shift (which is in general proportional to the DOS) at 83 K indicated a loss of\ndensity of states at the Lu site [11]. However, similar\n\n29\n\nSi NMR measurements performed\n\nrecently on polycrystalline samples of Lu5 Ir4 Si10 suggest that there is no loss of density of\nstates at the Si site across the CDW transition [12]. Thus given that pressure suppresses the\nTCDW (since the elastic energy cost to distort the lattice is now enhanced and the gain in\nelectronic energy due to the gapping at the FS can over-ride this cost at lower temperatures\nonly [13]) and that it seems that the Si site is not involved in the CDW distortions, one\n2\n\n\fwould expect the isostructural Lu5 Ir4 Ge10 compound which has a larger unit cell, to undergo\na CDW ordering at an elevated temperature compared to the Si compound. However, we\nfind that a high quality sample ( R(300K)\n= 98) of Lu5 Ir4 Ge10 only undergoes a transition into\nR(4K)\nthe superconducting state below 2.4 K without displaying any CDW transition at higher\ntemperatures.\nHence, it is of interest to study the evolution of the superconductivity and the CDW transition when we substitute small quantities of Ge for Si in Lu5 Ir4 Si10 . Towards this end, we\nhave carried out a detailed investigation of the superconductivity and CDW ordering in the\nalloy system Lu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 via our dc magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and\nheat capacity measurements.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nPolycrystalline samples (10 gms each) of the parent compounds Lu5 Ir4 Si10 and Lu5 Ir4 Ge10\nwere prepared first by arc melting the constituent elements in stoichiometric proportions.\nThe purity of the Lu was 99.99%, that of Ir was 99.9% and that of Si and Ge was 99.999%.\nThe melted ingots were flipped over and remelted 6 to 8 times to ensure homogenous mixing\nof the constituents. These ingots were used as master alloys for the preparation of the\npseudo-ternary alloys. Polycrystalline samples of Lu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 with x = 0.0, 0.005,\n0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 were then prepared by arc-melting together pieces taken in\nappropriate proportions from the previously prepared master alloys of the parent compounds\nLu5 Ir4 Si10 and Lu5 Ir4 Ge10 . The samples were annealed in a sealed quartz tube at 950 o C for\n10 days. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the structure and the absence\nof any impurity phases. The lattice constants for all the samples were estimated from a\nleast squares fit of their X-ray diffraction patterns. The results are given in Table 1. The\nlattice constants and the lattice volume increase roughly linearly as the Ge concentration is\nincreased in the alloy.\nThe dc magnetic susceptibility in the temperature range 2 K to 300 K was measured\nusing a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer\n(MPMS, Quantum design, USA). Electrical resistivity between 1.5 K and 300 K was measured with an LR-700 ac resistance bridge (Linear Research, USA) using the 4-probe technique with electrical contacts made by silver paste on bar shaped slides cut from the annealed\n3\n\n\fsamples. The heat capacity was measured between 2 K and 150 K using a commercial physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design, USA). The superconducting\ntransition temperature and the CDW ordering temperature were determined by peaks in\nthe derivatives of the magnetic susceptibility (d\u03c7/dT) and electrical resistivity (d\u03c1/dT) vs\ntemperature data and by the corresponding peaks in the heat capacity data obtained after\nsubtracting a smooth lattice background.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\nMagnetic Susceptibility studies\n\nIn Fig. 1, we show the temperature dependence of the dc susceptibility for the samples\nLu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 with x = 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1 between 1.7 K and 300 K to\nconcentrate on the samples with those values of x for which the CDW ordering transition\nis seen. The left hand panels in the figure show the zero field cooled (ZFC) and field\ncooled (FC) data recorded in a field of 10 Oe in the low temperature range to observe the\nsuperconducting transition. The right hand panels show the susceptibility data between\n5 K and 300 K recorded in a field of 1 koe to look for the CDW ordering transition. The\nsignature of a CDW in the susceptibility of a nonmagnetic sample is a diamagnetic drop\nacross the transition as the sample is cooled into the CDW state. This comes about due\nto the reduction in the density of states at the Fermi surface because of the opening up of\na gap at the Fermi surface accompanying the CDW ordering. It can immediately be seen\nthat even small Ge concentrations affect the CDW strongly. From an onset temperature of\n83 K for the unsubstituted sample Lu5 Ir4 Si10 , the CDW starts to shift to lower temperatures\nand also begins to broaden out considerably as the Ge concentration in the alloy increases.\nAt a concentration of only 10% of Ge, the CDW has been suppressed so much that it can\nno longer be detected. This can be seen in the lowest panel of Fig. 1. The values of the\nTCDW have been determined by peaks in the d(\u03c7)/dT vs T plots. The samples with higher\nconcentration of Ge (x>0.02) also do not show any signature of the CDW transition as can\nbe seen from Fig. 2.\nImportantly, there is a simultaneous increase in the superconducting transition temperature\nTC as can be clearly seen in the left hand panels of Figs. 1 and 2. The superconducting\n\n4\n\n\ftransition temperature reaches a maximum value of 6.6 K for x=0.2, i.e., for the sample\nLu5 Ir4 Si8 Ge2 (see Fig. 2). It must be noted that the CDW is last seen for x=0.05 but the\nsuperconducting transition temperature increases til the x=0.20 sample (see Fig. 2). We will\nreturn to this point when we discuss our results. For samples with higher concentrations of\nGe, the TC reduces until it reaches a value of 2.4 K for the pure Ge sample Lu5 Ir4 Ge10 .\nThe upturn in the susceptibility of all samples at the lowest temperatures is probably due to\ntrace amounts (few ppm) of paramagnetic impurities in the samples. However, as we increase\nthe concentration of Ge, we find that there is a tail in the susceptibility for temperatures\nhigher than TCDW (see fig. 1 and 2). This tail is not seen for the pure samples Lu5 Ir4 Si10\nor Lu5 Ir4 Ge10 . This indicates that the high temperature tails in the Ge substituted samples\nare not due to the increasing presence of any paramagnetic impurities introduced due to Ge\nsubstitution. Therefore, we believe that these tails in the Ge substituted samples are arising\ndue to the presence of regions with a distribution of TCDW 's. These regions however, have\nto be small since prominent anomalies occur only at lower temperatures where the bulk of\nthe sample undergoes the CDW transition.\n\nB.\n\nResistivity Studies\n\nIn Fig. 3, we show the temperature dependence of the normalized resistance for the\nLu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 samples with x = 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05. The main panels show\nthe data between 1.6 K and 300 K displaying the CDW transition at higher temperatures\nseen as an abrupt increase in the resistance across the transition. The insets show the low\ntemperature data between 1.6 K and 10 K on an expanded scale to highlight the superconducting transition for the various samples. For the unsubstituted sample Lu5 Ir4 Si10 , the\nCDW transition is seen as an abrupt step like increase in the resistance (see top right panel\nof Fig. 3). This upturn occurs due to the opening up of a gap at the Fermi surface (FS)\nassociated with the CDW transition. However, the resistance behavior after the transition\nremains metallic indicating that only partial gapping of the FS occurs.\nThe CDW, which is seen as a sharp and abrupt step like increase in the resistance for\nLu5 Ir4 Si10 , is suppressed to lower temperatures on substituting with Ge. Only a 0.5 atomic\npercent of Ge reduces the CDW transition temperature TCDW to 75 K from 83 K for the\nunsubstituted sample. The CDW transition is also progressively broadened or smeared\n5\n\n\fout and the magnitude of the anomaly in the resistance across the transition also reduces\nconsiderably. All these facts indicate a strong weakening/suppression of the CDW transition\nas the amount of Ge in the alloy Lu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 is increased.\nTo get a quantitative estimate of the effect of increasing disorder on the CDW transition,\nwe list in Table 2 the values of the CDW transition temperature determined by the\npeak position in the plots of d\u03c1(T)/dT vs T (not shown here) for various values of x\n(concentration of Ge in the alloy). Also listed in column 3 is the percentage increase in\nthe resistance across the CDW transition as a measure of the magnitude of the resistive\nanomaly due to the CDW. Lastly in column 4, we have given the width of the transition\nwhich has been estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks at\nthe transition as observed in the derivative of the resistivity data. No signatures of the\nCDW transition are observed for samples with higher Ge concentration (x>0.1) although\nthe superconducting transition temperature keeps increasing upti the x=0.20 sample, as is\nshown in Fig. 4 for samples with x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 1.0. The resistivity behavior of these\nsamples resembles that of normal intermetallic alloys and it is interesting to note that the\nresidual resistivity ratio (RRR =\n\nR(300K)\n)\nR(4K)\n\nincreases for samples with larger Ge substitution\n\nas compared to the low concentration samples where there is an upturn in the resistivity\ndue to the CDW. The superconducting transition temperature also ceases to increase and\nstarts to reduce once the effect of the CDW is completely suppressed until it reaches a\nvalue of about 2.4 K for the end member Lu5 Ir4 Ge10 .\nThese data show that the resistive anomaly due to the CDW transition is strongly\nsuppressed, smeared out or broadened and weakened by atomic disorder.\n\nC.\n\nHeat Capacity Studies\n\nFig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of the heat capacity for the compounds\nLu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 for x= 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05 between 2 K and 300 K. The\ninsets show the low temperature behavior on an expanded scale to show the superconducting transitions for the various compounds. The top panel shows the heat capacity for the\npure Si sample Lu5 Ir4 Si10 . The large peak of almost 75 J/mol K at 81 K (over the considerable lattice heat capacity at these temperatures) denotes the transition of the compound\n6\n\n\finto the CDW state. Large anomalies are also seen in the heat capacity for compounds\nwith x = .005 and 0.01. However, they appear to be reduced in magnitude and broadened\ncompared to the anomaly seen in the heat capacity for Lu5 Ir4 Si10 . For the compounds with\nx = 0.02 and 0.05, we observe weak anomalies only after subtraction of the heat capacity of\nthe compound Lu5 Ir4 Si6 Ge4 (which does not undergo any CDW transition) from the total\nheat capacity. The heat capacity jumps CCDW at the CDW transition for all the compounds\nhave been obtained in a similar way and the entropy change SCDW across the CDW transition has been estimated by integrating the CCDW /T versus T curves. This is shown in\nFig. 6 for the samples which undergo the CDW transition. The subtraction of the lattice\nheat capacity is not perfect and this shows up in the small tails observed below TCDW in the\nCCDW plots for the samples with x = 0.02 and 0.05 (fig. 6). Hence, the values of the entropy\nassociated with the CDW transitions is slightly overestimated for the x = 0.02 and 0.05\nsamples. Nevertheless, it can be seen that the entropy change associated with the CDW\ntransitions is considerable. We have collected the specific heat parameters for the CDW\ntransition for each compound in Table 4.\nThe CDW transition in Lu5 Ir4 Si10 has been shown to be of strong coupling and non meanfield like nature [8, 14]. In particular, Kuo et al [14] have analyzed the specific heat of\nLu5 Ir4 Si10 in the vicinity of the CDW transition with a model of critical fluctuations in\naddition to the BCS mean-field contributions. They find critical exponents which are much\nlarger (\u223c2) than expected for a mean-field like transition (0.5). They also estimate the\neffective electronic specific heat coefficient \u03b3 \u2217 and compare it with the bare Sommerfeld's\ncoefficient \u03b3 to show that the transition is of a strong-coupling nature [14]. We have also\nanalyzed our specific heat data in a similar manner for the compounds which show the\nCDW transition to see how these parameters evolve as the CDW is suppressed by the increasing disorder. We would like to understand the effect of disorder on the first-order like\nCDW transition in the parent compound Lu5 Ir4 Si10 and we hope to get insight about this\nin the way the critical exponents change for the samples with increasing Ge concentration.\nSimilarly \u03b3 \u2217 TCDW , which is an estimate of the specific heat jumps at TCDW is expected to\ndecrease. Therefore, using the notation of ref. 8, the specific heat can be written as\nC = CL + CM F + Cf l\n\n7\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere CL is the lattice background, CM F is the mean-field term below TCDW and Cf l is\nthe contribution to the heat capacity from critical fluctuations. At these temperatures the\nlattice term can be assumed to take the from given by the Einstein's model\nCL = a1 (\n\nea1 /T\na2 a3\n)\n2\nT\n(ea2 /T \u2212 1)\n\n(2)\n\nThus, the total heat capacity above and below TCDW was fitted to the functional form\n\u2212\n\nC \u2212 = CL + \u03b3 \u2217 TCDW (1 + \u03b2t) + b\u2212 |t|\u2212\u03b1 ,\n+\n\nC + = CL + b+ |t|\u2212\u03b1 ,\n\nT < TCDW\n\nT > TCDW\n\n(3)\n\nHere, the mean-field term below TCDW is given by\nCM F = \u03b3 \u2217 TCDW (1 + \u03b2t)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2217 is the effective electronic specific heat coefficient.\nThe critical fluctuation contribution to the heat capacity has been given by\n\u2212\n\nCf\u2212l = b\u2212 |t|\u2212\u03b1 ,\n+\n\nCf+l = b+ |t|\u2212\u03b1 ,\n\nT < TCDW\nT > TCDW\n\n(5)\n\nHere, a1 , a2 , a3 , \u03b3 \u2217 , \u03b2, b\u2212 and b+ are the effective fitting parameters, \u03b1\u2212 and \u03b1+ are called\n\u2212T\n) is the reduced temperature. Following the procethe critical exponents and t = ( TCDW\nTCDW\n\ndure of ref. 8, we have fitted the heat capacity data for the samples Lu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 with\nx = 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05. A very good agreement between the fit and the actual\ndata is obtained. This is shown in Fig. 7 for Lu5 Ir4 Si10 and Lu5 Ir4 Si9.8 Ge0.2 . The lower panel\nin this figure shows that for the sample Lu5 Ir4 Si9.8 Ge0.2 , although a finite discontinuity is\nobserved at TCDW in the fit, the data only shows a disorder/inhomogenity broadened weak\nanomaly. Therefore, it can be argued that although the estimates of the critical exponents\nfor the samples with x =0.02 and 0.05 may have larger error bars, they may not be completely incorrect given that the evolution of the exponents for these two compounds follow\nthe same trend which had emerged for the lower Ge concentration sample.\nThe fitted parameters for all the samples are collected in Table 4. As expected, the parameters of the lattice background term do not vary too much. It is seen that the critical\nexponents \u03b1\u2212 and \u03b1+ for Lu5 Ir4 Si10 are close to 2 (in agreement with the previous report\n8\n\n\f[14]) and are much larger than expected (= 0.5) for a mean-field like transition. However,\nwith increasing Ge concentration in the alloy, the values of the critical exponents reduce\nprogressively until they reach a value of about 0.6 for the compound Lu5 Ir4 Si9.5 Ge0.5 . The\nvalue of the electronic specific heat \u03b3 \u2217 comes out to be 7.2 \u00d7 10\u22122(J/molK 2 ) for Lu5 Ir4 Si10 .\nThe bare Sommerfeld's coefficient \u03b3 for Lu5 Ir4 Si10 is 9.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 (J/molK 2 ) [14] which gives\n\u03b3\u2217\n\u03b3\n\n= 7.85 which is about 5.5 times larger than the BCS weak-coupling limit value of 1.43.\n\nThis suggests the strong coupling nature of the CDW transition. The value of \u03b3 \u2217 and\n\u03b3 \u2217 TCDW (which is an indication of the specific heat jump at the CDW transition) progressively decrease with increasing x (see mean-field column in table 4). The evolution of the\ncritical exponents and \u03b3 \u2217 suggests that the CDW transition is of a strongly coupled nature\nand non mean-field like in the pure Si compound Lu5 Ir4 Si10 but changes to a mean-field like\ntransition with increasing disorder.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION: INTERPLAY BETWEEN SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND\n\nCHARGE DENSITY WAVE ORDERING\n\nIn Fig. 8, we combine the data from our magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements into a temperature-concentration (T-x) phase diagram for the alloys\nLu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 . The top panel shows the superconducting transition temperature vs.\nconcentration for all samples. The bottom panel shows TC and TCDW vs. concentration\nplots for samples with x= 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1 to highlight the relation between\nTC and TCDW . It can be seen that for low impurity concentration (x\u2264 0.02) the suppression of the CDW transition temperature TCDW and the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature TC is quasi-linear. We determine the initial concentration\ndependence (for small x) of TCDW and TC to be dTCDW /dx = -16.2(\u00b10.5) K/at.% and\ndTC /dx = 1.0(\u00b10.1) K/at.%. Interestingly, our values differ from the concentration dependences of these transition temperatures when the substitution is done at the Lu or Ir\nsite. For instance, for the pseudo-ternary compound (Lu1\u2212x Scx )5 Ir4 Si10 , it was found that\ndTCDW /dx = -18.5 K/at.% and dTC /dx = 0.5 K/at.% [15]. Thus, the initial suppression\nof TCDW for our compounds is 2 K slower and the enhancement of TC is double that of\nthe (Lu1\u2212x Scx )5 Ir4 Si10 alloys. Also, for the pseudo-ternary alloys obtained by substituting\nSc at the Lu or Rh at the Ir site, no CDW is observed at 5% substitution while we still\n9\n\n\fobserve a CDW transition as high as 47 K for the 5% sample. Only at a substitution of\n10% do we fail to observe any signature of a CDW transition. However, it would be wrong\nto deduce that the CDW, which occured as high as 47 K (albeit very weak) for x = 5%,\nsuddenly disappears at x = 10%. It must be noted that the superconductivity is enhanced\nto 6.3 K for the 10% Ge sample and in fact attains a maximum value equal to 6.6 K for a\n20% Ge substitution (see top panel of Fig. 5). This indicates that altough we are unable\nto detect any signatures of the CDW (probably because it had become extremely weak) in\nour bulk measurements on samples with Ge concentrations higher than 5%, some traces of\nthe CDW ordering persist even for samples with higher concentration of Ge and the gradual\nsuppression of this by increasing disorder enhances the superconductivity to as high as 6.6 K\nfor the 20% Ge sample. These values are about 0.5 K to 1 K higher than the superconductivity enhancement observed at the suppression of the CDW transition in pseudo-ternary\ncompounds obtained with substitution at the Lu or Ir site [15]. All these results indicate\nthat introducing Ge at the Si site is indeed different from substituting at the Lu or Ir sites.\nLet us now look at the concentration-temperature phase diagram of Lu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10\nto understand the interplay between the superconductivity and charge density wave ordering\nin this system. The lower panel clearly shows that the CDW ordering is strongly suppressed\nby even small impurity concentrations until there is no signature of a CDW transition in\neither the magnetic or the transport measurements for the samples with 10% Ge concentration. Importantly, the superconductivity is simultaneously enhanced. The superconducting\ntransition temperature TC increases rapidly for small Ge concentrations where the CDW is\nalso affected the most. At the value of x = 0.1, for which the CDW has been completely\nsuppressed, the TC ceases to increase rapidly and goes through a broad maximum at a\nvalue of about 6.6 K before decreasing again for higher values of x where the disorder takes\nover. This strongly indicates that the superconductivity in this system is enhanced at the\nexpense of the CDW ordering. Also, we note that the CDW is suppressed even though we\nare expanding the lattice which suggests that disorder suppresses the CDW more strongly\nthan pressure.\n\n10\n\n\fTABLE I: Lattice parameters of Lu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 .\nx\n\nV.\n\na=b(\u00b1.0005) (\u00c5) c(\u00b1.0005) (\u00c5)\n\nv (\u00c5)\n\nc/a\n\n0.00\n\n12.4756\n\n4.1767\n\n650.0682 0.33482\n\n0.005\n\n12.4767\n\n4.1770\n\n650.2361 0.33479\n\n0.01\n\n12.4795\n\n4.1775\n\n650.5915 0.33475\n\n0.02\n\n12.4837\n\n4.1781\n\n651.1333 0.33469\n\n0.05\n\n12.4923\n\n4.1804\n\n652.381 0.33464\n\n0.10\n\n12.5103\n\n4.1825\n\n654.5845 0.33432\n\n0.20\n\n12.5427\n\n4.1877\n\n658.8020 0.33387\n\n0.40\n\n12.6082\n\n4.2008\n\n667.7873 0.33318\n\n1.00\n\n12.8281\n\n4.2415\n\n697.98187 0.33064\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have measured dc magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and heat capacity of\nthe allow system Lu5 Ir4 (Si1\u2212x Gex )10 for x = 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0\nto investigate the evolution of the superconductivity and CDW transitions with increasing\ndisorder. We find that the CDW transition is strongly suppressed from 83 K for x = 0 down\nto 47 K for x = 0.05. There is no signature of the CDW for higher values of x. There is\na concomitant enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature from 3.9 K for\nx = 0.0 to 6.6 K for x = 0.2. Therefore, our results indicate that there is a strong interplay\nand competition between the superconductivity and the CDW ordering in this system. We\nalso conclude that the CDW transition is more sensitive to disorder than to pressure since\nthe CDW is suppressed even though we are expanding the lattice (which should normally\nhave taken the CDW to higher temperatures).\nAnalysis of the heat capacity data in the vicinity of the CDW phase transition suggests that\ndisorder drives the strongly-coupled and non mean-field like CDW transition in Lu5 Ir4 Si10\nto a broadened mean-field like transition in the samples where Ge is substituted for Si.\n\n[1] R.
