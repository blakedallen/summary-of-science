We show that the mapping class group of a compact orientable\nsurface with higher complexity has the following extreme rigidity in the sense\nof measure equivalence: if the mapping class group is measure equivalent to\na discrete group, then they are commensurable up to finite kernel. Moreover,\nwe describe all lattice embeddings of the mapping class group into a locally\ncompact second countable group. We also obtain similar results for finite direct\nproducts of mapping class groups.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe purpose of this paper is to establish a new rigidity theorem for the mapping\nclass group in terms of measure equivalence among discrete groups. In this paper,\nby a discrete group we mean a discrete and countable one. Measure equivalence\nwas introduced by Gromov [16] as follows:\nDefinition 1.1. We say that two discrete groups \u0393 and \u039b are measure equivalent if\nthere exists a measure-preserving action of \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b on a standard Borel space (\u03a3, m)\nwith a \u03c3-finite positive measure such that both restricted actions to \u0393 and \u039b are\nessentially free and have a fundamental domain of finite measure. The space (\u03a3, m)\n(equipped with the \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b-action) is then called a ME coupling of \u0393 and \u039b.\nIt is easy to see that measure equivalence defines an equivalence relation among\ndiscrete groups. One typical example of two measure equivalent groups is given by\nany two lattices in the same locally compact second countable (lcsc) group, which\nis the main geometric motivation for the introduction of this notion. Commensurability up to finite kernel is the equivalence relation for discrete groups defined\nby declaring two groups in an exact sequence 1 \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 1 of discrete\ngroups to be equivalent if the third group is finite. Any two discrete groups which\nare commensurable up to finite kernel are measure equivalent.\nMeasure equivalence between two groups has another equivalent formulation in\nterms of orbit equivalence (see Subsection 2.3), which has been studied for a long\ntime and is closely related to ergodic theory and the theory of von Neumann algebras. The first magnificent result about orbit equivalence is due to Ornstein-Weiss\n[33] following Dye [5], [6] and it can be stated in terms of measure equivalence as\nfollows: a discrete group is measure equivalent to Z if and only if it is an infinite amenable group. (This result was generalized for amenable discrete measured\nDate: July 19, 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 20F38, 37A20.\nKey words and phrases. The mapping class group, the curve complex, measure equivalence\nrigidity, lattice embeddings.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nequivalence relations by Connes-Feldman-Weiss [4].) Note that Zimmer [40] extended the superrigidity theorem for semisimple Lie groups of non-compact type\ndue to Mostow-Margulis to one in the context of orbit equivalence, which is called\nhis cocycle superrigidity theorem, and he classified lattices in simple Lie groups of\nreal rank at least 2 up to measure equivalence. In addition to this classification, his\ncocycle superrigidity theorem has many applications to various rigidity phenomena\nof higher rank lattices.\nRecently, the study of measure equivalence and orbit equivalence is very rapidly\ndeveloping. Furman's beautiful rigidity result in [11] completely determines the\nclass of discrete groups measure equivalent to some higher rank lattices. Namely, if\na discrete group \u039b is measure equivalent to a lattice in a connected simple Lie group\nG with finite center and real rank at least 2, then there exists a homomorphism from\n\u039b onto a lattice in AdG whose kernel is finite. Gaboriau's discovery in [14] that\nl2 -Betti numbers for discrete groups are invariant under measure equivalence in a\ncertain sense leads to surprising progress in the classification problem of measure\nequivalence because these numerical invariants are defined for all discrete groups\nand are computable for various discrete groups arising geometrically. Popa showed\nin [34], [35] that the Bernoulli shifts of Kazhdan groups have various strong rigidity\nproperties in terms of orbit equivalence. It is remarkable that he treated all Kazhdan\ngroups, which is a very large class of groups. The reader should be referred to [15],\n[37], [38] for more details of recent development of measure equivalence and orbit\nequivalence.\nLet M = Mg,p be a connected compact orientable surface of type (g, p), that\nis, of genus g and with p boundary components. Throughout the paper, a surface\nis assumed to be connected, compact and orientable unless otherwise stated. The\nmapping class group \u0393(M ) of M is defined as the group of isotopy classes of all\norientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of M . The extended mapping class group\n\u0393(M )\u22c4 of M is the group of isotopy classes of all diffeomorphisms of M , which\ncontains \u0393(M ) as a subgroup of index 2. Let \u03ba(M ) = 3g + p \u2212 4 be the complexity\nof M . If \u03ba(M ) > 0, we say that M has higher complexity. Let C = C(M ) be\nthe curve complex for a surface M . In [25], we obtain some classification result\nof \u0393(M ) in terms of measure equivalence and give various examples of discrete\ngroups not measure equivalent to \u0393(M ). In the proof, we established fundamental\nmethods to study subrelations in a discrete measured equivalence relation arising\nfrom a standard action of \u0393(M ), where a standard action means an essentially free,\nmeasure-preserving action on a standard Borel space with a finite positive measure.\nThe curve complex played one of the most important roles in the study of them.\nUsing these methods, we show the following rigidity theorem for \u0393(M ), which can\nbe viewed as an analogue of Furman's rigidity theorem and is the main result of this\npaper. Let Aut(C) denote the automorphism group of the simplicial complex C.\nNote that Aut(C) and \u0393(M ) are commensurable up to finite kernel (see Theorem\n2.5).\nTheorem 1.1. If a discrete group \u039b is measure equivalent to the mapping class\ngroup \u0393(M ) with \u03ba(M ) > 0, then there exists a homomorphism \u03c1 : \u039b \u2192 Aut(C)\nwhose kernel and cokernel are both finite.\nThis theorem completely determines the class of discrete groups measure equivalent to \u0393(M ) and provides the first example of infinite discrete groups with such\nan extreme rigidity in the theory of measure equivalence. Remark that uniform\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n3\n\nand non-uniform lattices in Lie groups treated in Furman's rigidity result are not\ncommensurable up to finite kernel because they are not quasi-isometric [7]. Hence,\nif \u0393 is a lattice as in Furman's rigidity theorem, then there exists a discrete group\nwhich is measure equivalent to \u0393 and is not commensurable up to finite kernel with\n\u0393.\nRemark 1.1. Although both Furman's and Popa's rigidity theorems are concerned\nwith discrete groups satisfying (or related to) Kazhdan's property, the mapping\nclass group for a surface of genus at most 2 does not have Kazhdan's property\nor more strongly, it contains a subgroup of finite index which admits a quotient\nisomorphic to a non-abelian free group of finite rank (see [32]). It is unknown\nwhether the mapping class groups for other surfaces have Kazhdan's property or\nnot.\nTheorem 1.1 completes the classification of mapping class groups up to measure\nequivalence.\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose that M 1 , M 2 are distinct surfaces of type (g1 , p1 ), (g2 , p2 ),\nrespectively with \u03ba(M 1 ), \u03ba(M 2 ) > 0 and g1 \u2264 g2 . Moreover, assume that \u0393(M 1 ) and\n\u0393(M 2 ) are measure equivalent. Then we only have the following two possibilities:\n((g1 , p1 ), (g2 , p2 )) = ((0, 5), (1, 2)), ((0, 6), (2, 0)).\nRemark 1.2. Note that if \u03ba(M ) < 0 and M 6= M1,0 , then \u0393(M ) is finite. Both\n\u0393(M1,0 ) and \u0393(M1,1 ) are isomorphic to SL(2, Z) and \u0393(M0,4 ) is commensurable up\nto finite kernel with SL(2, Z). It is known that \u0393(M0,5 ) and \u0393(M1,2 ) (resp. \u0393(M0,6 )\nand \u0393(M2,0 )) are commensurable up to finite kernel (see Theorem 2.5).\nLet \u0393 be a lattice in a connected simple Lie group G with finite center and\nreal rank at least 2. In the proof of Furman's rigidity theorem in [11], the main\ningredient is to prove the following (see [11, Theorem 4.1]): let (\u03a9, \u03c9) be a self ME\ncoupling of \u0393 (i.e., a ME coupling of \u0393 and \u0393). Then there exists an essentially\nunique almost \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393-equivariant Borel map \u03a8 : \u03a9 \u2192 Aut(AdG), which means that\n\u03a8((\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 )x) = Ad(\u03b3)\u03a8(x)Ad(\u03b3 \u2032 )\u22121\nfor any \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 \u0393 and a.e. x \u2208 \u03a9. Furman substantially used Zimmer's cocycle\nsuperrigidity theorem for the construction of \u03a8. On the other hand, we can show\nthat for a self ME coupling (\u03a3, m) of \u0393(M ), there exists an essentially unique almost\n\u0393(M ) \u00d7 \u0393(M )-equivariant Borel map \u03a6 : \u03a3 \u2192 Aut(C), which means that\n\u03a6((\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 )x) = \u03c0(\u03b3)\u03a6(x)\u03c0(\u03b3 \u2032 )\u22121\nfor any \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 \u0393(M ) and a.e. x \u2208 \u03a3. Here, \u03c0 : \u0393(M )\u22c4 \u2192 Aut(C) is the natural\nhomomorphism. This construction of \u03a6 is the heart of the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nIn Section 3, we give an outline of the construction of \u03a6.\nAfter the construction of the map \u03a6, we apply Furman's and Monod-Shalom's\ntechniques in [11], [31] for higher rank lattices and non-trivial direct products of\nfinitely many groups with special properties (e.g., word-hyperbolic ones), which are\napplicable to a more general situation. More precisely, given a ME coupling (\u03a3\u2032 , m\u2032 )\nof \u0393(M ) and a discrete group \u039b, we construct the self ME coupling \u03a3\u2032 \u00d7\u039b \u039b \u00d7\u039b \u03a3\u030c\u2032 .\nUsing their techniques for the equivariant Borel map from this self ME coupling\ninto Aut(C), one can find a homomorphism \u03c1 as in Theorem 1.1.\nMoreover, we consider the same problem as above for a finite direct product\n\u0393(M1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393(Mn ) of mapping class groups \u0393(Mi ) with \u03ba(Mi ) > 0 for all i.\n\n\f4\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nMonod-Shalom introduced in [31] the class C consisting of discrete groups \u0393 which\nadmit a mixing unitary representation \u03c0 on a Hilbert space such that the second\nbounded cohomology Hb2 (\u0393, \u03c0) of \u0393 with coefficient \u03c0 does not vanish. They showed\nin that paper that a non-trivial finite direct product of discrete groups in C satisfies\nvarious measurable rigidity properties. The class C contains a large number of\ndiscrete groups arising geometrically (e.g., word-hyperbolic ones) and whether a\ndiscrete group is in C or not is invariant under measure equivalence. Hamenst\u00e4dt\nproved in [19] that the mapping class group of a surface with higher complexity is\ncontained in C, so we can obtain various measurable rigidity theorems as in [31] for\ndirect products of mapping class groups.\nFollowing Monod-Shalom's ingenious technique treating fundamental domains\nfor actions on ME couplings, we can find an essentially unique almost equivariant\nBorel map from a self ME coupling of a direct product of \u0393(Mi ) into the direct\nproduct of Aut(C(Mi )). In the same way as above, we can show the following\ntheorem similar to Theorem 1.1 for a direct product of \u0393(Mi ):\nTheorem 1.3. Let n be a positive integer and let Mi be a surface with \u03ba(Mi ) > 0\nfor i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. If a discrete group \u039b is measure equivalent to the direct product\n\u0393(M1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393(Mn ), then there exists a homomorphism \u039b \u2192 Aut(C(M1 )) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7\nAut(C(Mn )) whose kernel and cokernel are both finite.\nIn [13], Furman gave another application of the map \u03a8 mentioned above. He\ngave an explicit description of a lcsc group containing a lattice isomorphic to a\nlattice in a simple Lie group of higher rank. Roughly speaking, he showed that\nsuch a lcsc group can be built only from the ambient Lie group or from the lattice\nitself and their actions on a compact group. Following Furman, we describe a lcsc\ngroup containing a lattice isomorphic to the mapping class group as follows. We\nfix notations as follows: let n \u2208 N and let Mi be a surface with \u03ba(Mi ) > 0 for\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Put\nG = Aut(C(M1 )) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Aut(C(Mn ))\nand let Gi be equal to \u0393(Mi )\u22c4 or Aut(C(Mi )). Put G0 = G1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Gn and let\n\u03c0 : G0 \u2192 G be the natural homomorphism.\nTheorem 1.4. Suppose that \u0393 is a subgroup of finite index in G0 and there is a\nlattice embedding \u03c3 : \u0393 \u2192 H into a lcsc group H, that is, \u03c3 is an injective homomorphism such that \u03c3(\u0393) is a lattice in H. Then we have a subgroup H0 of finite\nindex in H containing \u03c3(\u0393) and a compact normal subgroup K of H0 satisfying the\nfollowing:\n(i) [H : H0 ] \u2264 [G : \u03c0(\u0393)];\n(ii) The action of H on K by conjugation induces via \u03c3 an action of \u0393 on\nK and hence a semi-direct product \u0393 \u22c9 K. Let p : \u0393 \u22c9 K \u2192 H0 be the\nhomomorphism defined by \u0393 \u220b \u03b3 7\u2192 \u03c3(\u03b3) and K \u220b k 7\u2192 k. Then p is\nsurjective;\n(iii) For \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and k \u2208 K, we have (\u03b3, k) \u2208 ker(p) if and only if \u03c0(\u03b3) = e\nand k = \u03c3(\u03b3)\u22121 . In particular, if the kernel of the restriction of \u03c0 to \u0393 is\ntrivial, then p is an isomorphism.\nThis theorem says that there exist no interesting lattice embeddings of the mapping class group. The following corollary can easily be shown:\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n5\n\nCorollary 1.5. Let \u0393 be a subgroup of finite index in G0 and suppose that we have\na lattice embedding of \u0393 into a lcsc group H. Then the image of \u0393 is cocompact in\nH and H has infinitely many connected components.\nIt follows from this corollary that any subgroup of finite index of the mapping\nclass group for a surface with higher complexity can not be isomorphic to a lattice in\na semisimple Lie group, which was proved first by Kaimanovich-Masur [24]. They\nshowed more generally that any sufficiently large subgroup of the mapping class\ngroup can not be isomorphic to a lattice in a semisimple Lie group. In this direction,\nFarb-Masur [8], Bestvina-Fujiwara [2] and Yeung [39] studied homomorphisms from\na lattice in some semisimple Lie group into the mapping class group and concluded\nthat their images are finite.\nIn a subsequent paper [26], we give an application of the existence of an equivariant Borel map from a self ME coupling of the mapping class group, following\nFurman's idea in [12]. In [26], we establish orbit equivalence rigidity of ergodic\nstandard actions of the mapping class group and give a new example of a discrete\nmeasured equivalence relation which can not arise from any standard action of a\ndiscrete group. Moreover, we give uncountably many explicit examples of ergodic\nstandard actions of the mapping class group which are mutually non-orbit equivalent, using certain generalized Bernoulli shifts of the mapping class group.\nAcknowledgement.

In this subsection, we recall fundamental facts\nabout the mapping class group and several geometric objects related to it. We refer\nthe reader to [9], [21], [23] or Sections 3.1, 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5 in [25] and the references\ntherein for the material of this subsection.\nLet M = Mg,p be a surface of genus g and with p boundary components. Let\n\u0393(M ), \u0393(M )\u22c4 be the mapping class group and the extended one of M , respectively,\ndefined as in Section 1. Let \u03ba(M ) = 3g + p \u2212 4 be the complexity of M . When\n\u03ba(M ) > 0, we say that M has higher complexity.\nFor a surface M , let V (C) = V (C(M )) be the set of all non-trivial isotopy classes\nof non-peripheral simple closed curves on M . Let S(M ) denote the set of all nonempty finite subsets of V (C) which can be realized disjointly on M at the same\ntime. If \u03ba(M ) > 0, we can define the curve complex C = C(M ) as a simplicial\ncomplex whose vertex set is V (C) and simplex set is S(M ). Remark that when\n\u03ba(M ) = 0, we can define the curve complex of M in a slightly different way so that\nits vertex set V (C) is given in the same way as above. If \u03ba(M ) \u2265 0, then \u0393(M )\u22c4\nhas the natural and simplicial action on C and C is connected and has infinite\ndiameter. Moreover, when C is equipped with a natural combinatorial metric, it is\nhyperbolic in the sense of Gromov (see [29]).\nLet M be a surface with \u03ba(M ) \u2265 0 and let i : V (C)\u00d7V (C) \u2192 N be the geometric\nintersection number. Let MF = MF (M ) be the space of measured foliations on\nM . Let PMF = PMF(M ) be the space of projective measured foliations on M ,\nwhich is also called the Thurston boundary and is homeomorphic to the sphere of\n\n\f6\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\ndimension 6g \u2212 7 + 2p. Note that S(M ) can naturally be embedded into PMF.\nThe geometric intersection number i can continuously and R>0 -homogeneously be\nextended to a function MF \u00d7 MF \u2192 R\u22650 in the following sense:\ni(r1 F1 , r2 F2 ) = r1 r2 i(F1 , F2 )\nfor any r1 , r2 \u2208 R>0 and F1 , F2 \u2208 MF . Hence, for two elements F1 , F2 \u2208 PMF,\nwhether i(F1 , F2 ) = 0 or 6= 0 makes sense. It is clear that \u0393(M )\u22c4 acts continuously\non both MF and PMF and\ni(gF1 , gF2 ) = i(F1 , F2 )\nfor any g \u2208 \u0393(M )\u22c4 and F1 , F2 \u2208 MF (or PMF). Let\nMIN = {F \u2208 PMF : i(F, \u03b1) 6= 0 for any \u03b1 \u2208 V (C)}\nbe the set of all minimal measured foliations on M , which is a \u0393(M )\u22c4 -invariant\nBorel subset of PMF.\nThe Thurston boundary PMF is an ideal boundary of the Teichm\u00fcller space of\nT = T (M ) for M . The union T = T \u222a PMF is called the Thurston compactification of the Teichm\u00fcller space, which is homeomorphic to the closed Euclidean ball\nof dimension 6g \u2212 6 + 2p whose boundary corresponds to PMF.\nFor g \u2208 \u0393(M ), let us denote by\nFix(g) = {x \u2208 T : gx = x}\nthe fixed point set of g. Each element g \u2208 \u0393(M ) is classified as follows in terms of\nits fixed points on T (see Exp\u00f3se 9, \u00a7V, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me and Exp\u00f3se 11, \u00a74, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me in\n[9]):\n(i) g has finite order and has a fixed point on T ;\n(ii) g is pseudo-Anosov, which means that Fix(g) consists of exactly two points\nin MIN ;\n(iii) g has infinite order and is reducible, which means that there exists \u03c3 \u2208\nS(M ) such that g\u03c3 = \u03c3.\nThese three types are mutually exclusive. We say that F \u2208 PMF is a pseudoAnosov foliation if F is a fixed point for some pseudo-Anosov element. The set of\nall pseudo-Anosov elements is dense in PMF.\nSince the curve complex C is hyperbolic, we can consider its boundary \u2202C at\ninfinity, which is not compact. There exists a natural \u0393(M )-equivariant continuous\nmap MIN \u2192 \u2202C, which is injective on the set of all uniquely ergodic measured\nfoliations. This set contains all pseudo-Anosov foliations (see [18], [27] or [25,\nSection 3.2]).\nA pseudo-Anosov element g \u2208 \u0393(M ) has the following remarkable dynamics on\nT (see [23, Theorem 7.3.A]): the two fixed points F\u00b1 (g) \u2208 MIN of g satisfy that\nif U is any neighborhood of F+ (g) in T and K is any compact set in T \\ {F\u2212 (g)},\nthen g n (K) \u2282 U for all sufficiently large n \u2208 N.\nUsing the above classification of elements of \u0393(M ), McCarthy-Papadopoulos [30]\nclassified subgroups \u0393 of \u0393(M ) as follows:\n(i) \u0393 is finite;\n(ii) there exists a pseudo-Anosov element g \u2208 \u0393 such that h{F\u00b1 (g)} = {F\u00b1 (g)}\nfor any h \u2208 \u0393. In this case, \u0393 is virtually cyclic;\n(iii) there exists \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) such that g\u03c3 = \u03c3 for any g \u2208 \u0393. In this case, \u0393 is\nsaid to be reducible;\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n7\n\n(iv) \u0393 contains an independent pair {g1 , g2 } of pseudo-Anosov elements, which\nmeans {F\u00b1 (g1 )} \u2229 {F\u00b1 (g2 )} = \u2205. In this case, \u0393 contains a non-abelian free\nsubgroup and is said to be sufficiently large.\nWe recall the canonical reduction system (CRS) for a subgroup of \u0393(M ), which\nplays an important role in the study of reducible subgroups. We refer the reader to\n[21, Chapter 7] for more details about CRS's. For \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ), we denote by M\u03c3 for\nsimplicity the surface obtained by cutting along a realization of curves in \u03c3. For\nan integer m \u2265 3, let \u0393(M ; m) be the subgroup of \u0393(M ) consisting of all elements\nwhich act on the homology group H1 (M ; Z/mZ) trivially. This subgroup has the\nfollowing notable properties (see Theorem 1.2 and Corollaries 1.5, 1.8, 3.6 in [21]\nor [25, Section 4.3]):\nTheorem 2.1. In the above notation, the following assertions hold:\n(i) \u0393(M ; m) is a torsion-free subgroup of finite index in \u0393(M ).\n(ii) If g \u2208 \u0393(M ; m) and F \u2208 PMF satisfy g n F = F for some n \u2208 Z \\ {0}, then\ngF = F .\n(iii) If g \u2208 \u0393(M ; m) and \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) satisfy g n \u03c3 = \u03c3 for some n \u2208 Z \\ {0}, then\ng\u03b1 = \u03b1 for any \u03b1 \u2208 S(M ) and g preserves each component of M\u03c3 and of\nthe boundary of M .\nWhen we consider the problem of measure equivalence in subsequent sections,\nwe study actions of (a finite index subgroup of) \u0393(M ; m) instead of \u0393(M ).\nLet \u0393 be a subgroup of \u0393(M ; m). A curve \u03b1 \u2208 V (C) is called an essential\nreduction class for \u0393 if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(i) g\u03b1 = \u03b1 for any g \u2208 \u0393;\n(ii) if \u03b2 \u2208 V (C) satisfies i(\u03b1, \u03b2) 6= 0, then there exists g \u2208 \u0393 such that g\u03b2 6= \u03b2.\nThe canonical reduction system (CRS) \u03c3(\u0393) for \u0393 is defined to be the set of all\nessential reduction classes for \u0393, which is either an element in S(M ) or empty. We\ncan define the CRS for a general subgroup \u0393 of \u0393(M ) as the CRS for \u0393 \u2229 \u0393(M ; m),\nwhich is independent of m. It is known that an infinite subgroup \u0393 of \u0393(M ) is\nreducible if and only if \u03c3(\u0393) is non-empty (see [21, Corollary 7.17]).\nGiven a subgroup \u0393 of \u0393(M ; m) and \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) with g\u03c3 = \u03c3 for any g \u2208 \u0393,\nthanks to Theorem 2.1 (iii), we can define a natural homomorphism\nY\np\u03c3 : \u0393 \u2192\n\u0393(Q),\nQ\n\nwhere Q runs through all components of M\u03c3 .\n\nLemma 2.2 ([3, Lemma 2.1 (1)], [23, Corollary 4.1.B]). The kernel of p\u03c3 is contained in the subgroup of \u0393(M ) generated by Dehn twists about all curves in \u03c3.\nFor each component Q of M\u03c3 , let pQ : \u0393 \u2192 \u0393(Q) be the composition of p\u03c3 with\nthe projection onto \u0393(Q). It is known that if a subgroup \u0393 of \u0393(M ; m) is reducible\nand Q is a component of M\u03c3(\u0393) , then the image pQ (\u0393) either is trivial or contains\na pseudo-Anosov element in \u0393(Q) (see [21, Corollary 7.18]). If pQ (\u0393) is trivial,\ninfinite amenable or non-amenable, then Q is said to be T, IA or IN, respectively.\nLemma 2.3. Let \u0393 be a finite index subgroup of \u0393(M ) and define a subgroup\n\u0393\u03c3 = {g \u2208 \u0393 : g\u03c3 = \u03c3}\nfor \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ). Then the CRS for \u0393\u03c3 is equal to \u03c3.\n\n\f8\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nThis lemma follows easily from [21, Theorem 7.16] because any component of\nM\u03c3 which is not a pair of pants is IN for \u0393\u03c3 if \u0393 is a finite index subgroup of\n\u0393(M ; m) with an integer m \u2265 3.\nLemma 2.4. Let \u0393 be an infinite subgroup of \u0393(M ; m) and let \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(M )).\nAssume that g\u03b1 = \u03b1 for all g \u2208 \u0393. If for each component Q of M\u03b1 , we have g\u03b2 = \u03b2\nfor any \u03b2 \u2208 V (C(Q)) and g \u2208 \u0393, then the CRS for \u0393 is {\u03b1}.\nProof. Since \u0393 is infinite and reducible, the CRS \u03c3(\u0393) for \u0393 is non-empty. Let\n\u03b4 \u2208 \u03c3(\u0393). We show that \u03b4 = \u03b1. Let Q be a component of M\u03b1 . If \u03b4 \u2208 V (C(Q)),\nthen there exists \u03b2 \u2208 V (C(Q)) with i(\u03b2, \u03b4) 6= 0. By assumption, \u03b2 is invariant for\n\u0393, which contradicts the assumption that \u03b4 is an essential reduction class for \u0393.\nThus, either i(\u03b4, \u03b1) 6= 0 or \u03b4 = \u03b1. The former case can not happen because \u03b1 is\ninvariant for \u0393 and \u03b4 \u2208 \u03c3(\u0393).\n\u0003\n2.2. The automorphism group of the curve complex. Let M be a surface\nwith \u03ba(M ) > 0. Then we have the natural homomorphism \u03c0 : \u0393(M )\u22c4 \u2192 Aut(C).\nTheorem 2.5 ([22], [28]). Let M be a surface with \u03ba(M ) > 0.\n(i) If M is neither M1,2 nor M2,0 , then \u03c0 is an isomorphism.\n(ii) If M = M1,2 , then the image of \u03c0 is a subgroup of Aut(C) with index 5\nand ker(\u03c0) is the subgroup generated by a hyperelliptic involution, which is\nisomorphic to Z/2Z.\n(iii) If M = M2,0 , then \u03c0 is surjective and ker(\u03c0) is the subgroup generated by\na hyperelliptic involution, which is isomorphic to Z/2Z.\n(iv) The two curve complexes C(M0,5 ), C(M1,2 ) (resp. C(M0,6 ), C(M2,0 )) are\nisomorphic as simplicial complexes.\nTheorem 2.6. Let \u0393 be a subgroup of finite index in Aut(C). For each g0 \u2208\nAut(C) \\ {e}, the set {gg0 g \u22121 : g \u2208 \u0393} consists of infinitely many elements.\nProof. We may assume that M 6= M1,2 , M2,0 by Theorem 2.5 (iv). By Theorem\n2.5 (i), we identify Aut(C) with \u0393(M )\u22c4 . Let g0 \u2208 \u0393(M )\u22c4 and assume that the set\n{gg0 g \u22121 : g \u2208 \u0393} consists of only finitely many elements. Then note that for any\ninfinite subset {hn }n\u2208N of \u0393, there exists an infinite subsequence {ni }i\u2208N of N such\n\u22121\nthat hni g0 h\u22121\nni = hnj g0 hnj for each i, j. Put\nFix(g0 ) = {x \u2208 T : g0 x = x},\nwhich is a non-empty closed subset of T .\nAssume Fix(g0 ) 6\u2283 PMF. If we deduce a contradiction, then the inclusion\nFix(g0 ) \u2283 PMF holds, which implies g0 = e and completes the proof. Since the\nset of pseudo-Anosov foliations is dense in PMF , we can find an independent pair\n{g1 , g2 } \u2282 \u0393(M ) of pseudo-Anosov elements such that F+ (g1 ), F+ (g2 ) \u2208 PMF \\\nFix(g0 ). Using the assumption that \u0393 is a subgroup of finite index in \u0393(M )\u22c4 , we\nmay assume that g1 , g2 \u2208 \u0393.\nLet s \u2208 Fix(g0 ). It follows from the above remark that there exists an infinite\nincreasing subsequence {ni } of N such that g1\u2212ni g0 g1ni = g0 for each i. Then we\nhave s = g0 s = g1\u2212ni g0 g1ni s, which implies g1ni s \u2208 Fix(g0 ) for each i. If s 6= F\u2212 (g1 ),\nthen g1ni s \u2192 F+ (g1 ) \u2208 PMF \\ Fix(g0 ) as i \u2192 \u221e, which is a contradiction. Thus,\ns = F\u2212 (g1 ). Similarly, we can show that if s \u2208 Fix(g0 ), then s = F\u2212 (g2 ), which is\na contradiction because the pair {g1 , g2 } is independent.\n\u0003\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n9\n\n2.3. Measure equivalence and orbit equivalence. In this subsection, we recall\nthe construction of weakly orbit equivalent actions from a ME coupling given in [12,\nSection 3]. We refer the reader to [1] for the terminology of an r-discrete measured\ngroupoid and its amenability. We fix notations as follows: given an r-discrete\nmeasured groupoid G on a standard finite measure space (X, \u03bc) (i.e., a standard\nBorel space with a finite positive measure) and a Borel subset A \u2282 X with positive\nmeasure, we denote by\n(G)A = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : r(\u03b3), s(\u03b3) \u2208 A}\nthe restricted groupoid to A, where r, s : G \u2192 X are the range, source maps, respectively. For x, y \u2208 X, let\nGyx = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : r(\u03b3) = x, s(\u03b3) = y}\nand let ex \u2208 Gxx denote the unit. If A is a Borel subset of X, then GA denotes the\nsaturation defined by\nGA = {r(\u03b3) \u2208 X : \u03b3 \u2208 G, s(\u03b3) \u2208 A},\nwhich is a Borel subset of X.\nLet (\u03a3, m) be a ME coupling of discrete groups \u0393 and \u039b, and choose fundamental\ndomains Y, X \u2282 \u03a3 for the \u0393-, \u039b-actions. Remark that we have a natural \u0393-action\non X equipped with the restricted measure of m because X can be identified with\nthe quotient space \u03a3/\u039b as Borel spaces. Similarly, we have a natural \u039b-action on\nY . In order to distinguish from the original \u0393-, \u039b-actions on \u03a3, we denote the \u0393-,\n\u039b-actions on X, Y by \u03b3 * x, \u03bb * y, respectively, using a dot. Note that we can choose\nX and Y so that A = X \u2229 Y satisfies \u0393 * A = X and \u039b * A = Y up to null sets. In\nwhat follows, suppose that X and Y satisfy this condition.\nLet G = \u0393 \u22c9 X (resp. H = \u039b \u22c9 Y ) be the r-discrete measured groupoid on (X, \u03bc)\n(resp. (Y, \u03bd)) constructed from the above action. We can define cocycles\n\u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 X \u2192 \u039b, \u03b2 : \u039b \u00d7 Y \u2192 \u0393\nso that \u03b3 * x = \u03b1(\u03b3, x)\u03b3x \u2208 X and \u03bb * y = \u03b2(\u03bb, y)\u03bby \u2208 Y for any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and\na.e. x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y . Let\np : X \u2192 Y, q : Y \u2192 X\nbe the Borel maps defined by\np(x) = \u0393x \u2229 Y, q(y) = \u039by \u2229 X\nfor x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y . Note that both p and q are the identity on A = X \u2229 Y and\np(\u03b3 * x) = \u03b1(\u03b3, x) * p(x), q(\u03bb * y) = \u03b2(\u03bb, y) * q(y)\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and a.e. x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y . Define groupoid homomorphisms\nf : G \u220b (\u03b3, x) 7\u2192 (\u03b1(\u03b3, x), p(x)) \u2208 H\ng : H \u220b (\u03bb, y) 7\u2192 (\u03b2(\u03bb, y), q(y)) \u2208 G.\nNote that \u03b2(\u03b1(\u03b3, x), x) = \u03b3 for any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and a.e. x \u2208 A with \u03b3 * x \u2208 A, and\n\u03b1(\u03b2(\u03bb, y), y) = \u03bb for any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and a.e. y \u2208 A with \u03bb * y \u2208 A. Therefore, we obtain\nthe following:\nProposition 2.7. The groupoid homomorphisms\nf : (G)A \u2192 (H)A , g : (H)A \u2192 (G)A\nsatisfy g \u25e6 f = id and f \u25e6 g = id.\n\n\f10\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nThis proposition implies that the two actions of \u0393 on X and \u039b on Y are weakly\norbit equivalent.\nConsider the \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b-action on X \u00d7 \u039b defined by\n\u03b3\u03bb(x, \u03bb\u2032 ) = (\u03b3 * x, \u03b1(\u03b3, x)\u03bb\u2032 \u03bb\u22121 ).\nIt is easy to check the following lemma:\nLemma 2.8. The Borel map \u03a3 \u2192 X \u00d7 \u039b defined by \u03bbx 7\u2192 (x, \u03bb\u22121 ) for x \u2208 X and\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b is Borel isomorphic and \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b-equivariant.\nConversely, we know the following theorem. For simplicity, a standard action of\na discrete group means an essentially free, measure-preserving Borel action of it on\na standard finite measure space.\nTheorem 2.9 ([12, Theorem 3.3]). If two discrete groups \u0393 and \u039b have ergodic\nstandard actions on (X, \u03bc) and (Y, \u03bd) which are weakly orbit equivalent, then we\ncan construct a ME coupling (\u03a3, m) of \u0393 and \u039b such that the \u0393-actions on X and\n\u039b\\\u03a3 (resp. the \u039b-actions on Y and \u0393\\\u03a3) are isomorphic.\n2.4. Normal subgroupoids. In this subsection, we introduce the notion of normal\nsubgroupoids of an r-discrete measured groupoid, based on [10], [25, Subsection\n4.6.1]. This notion is a generalization of normal subrelations of a discrete measured\nequivalence relation and also a generalization of normal subgroups of a discrete\ngroup.\nLet G be an r-discrete measured groupoid on a standard finite measure space\n(X, \u03bc) and r, s : G \u2192 X be the range, source maps, respectively. Let S be a subgroupoid of G. In this paper, a subgroupoid of G means a Borel subgroupoid of G\nwhose unit space is the same as the one for G. Let us denote by EndS (G) the set\nof all Borel maps \u03c6 : dom(\u03c6) \u2192 G from a Borel subset of X such that\n(i) s(\u03c6(x)) = x for a.e. x \u2208 dom(\u03c6);\n(ii) \u03b3 \u2208 S if and only if \u03c6(r(\u03b3))\u03b3\u03c6(s(\u03b3))\u22121 \u2208 S for a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (G)dom(\u03c6) .\nLet [[G]]S be the subset of EndS (G) consisting of all \u03c6 such that the map dom(\u03c6) \u220b\nx 7\u2192 r(\u03c6(x)) \u2208 X is injective a.e. on the domain. When S is trivial, we write [[G]]\ninstead of [[G]]S .\nWe define the composition \u03c8\u25e6\u03c6 : dom(\u03c8\u25e6\u03c6) \u2192 G of two elements \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 EndS (G)\nby\ndom(\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6) = {x \u2208 dom(\u03c6) : r(\u03c6(x)) \u2208 dom(\u03c8)},\n\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6(x) = \u03c8(r(\u03c6(x)))\u03c6(x)\nfor x \u2208 dom(\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6). It is easy to check that \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2208 EndS (G).\nDefinition 2.1. A subgroupoid S of an r-discrete measured groupoid G on a standard finite measure space (X, \u03bc) is said to be normal in G if the following condition is\nsatisfied: there exists a countable family {\u03c6n } of maps in EndS (G) such that for a.e.\n\u03b3 \u2208 G, we can find \u03c6n in the family satisfying r(\u03b3) \u2208 dom(\u03c6n ) and \u03c6n (r(\u03b3))\u03b3 \u2208 S.\nIn this case, we write S \u22b3 G and we call {\u03c6n } a family of normal choice functions\nfor the pair (G, S).\nThe following two lemmas give natural examples of normal subgroupoids:\nLemma 2.10. Suppose that a discrete group G has a non-singular action on (X, \u03bc)\nand H is a normal subgroup of G. Let GG and GH be the groupoids generated by\nthe actions of G and H, respectively. Then the subgroupoid GH is normal in GG .\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n11\n\nThe following two lemmas can be proved by using [25, Theorem 3.9]:\nLemma 2.11. Let G be an r-discrete measured groupoid on (X, \u03bc). Then the\nisotropy groupoid\nG0 = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : r(\u03b3) = s(\u03b3)}\nis normal in G.\nLemma 2.12. Let G be an r-discrete measured groupoid on (X, \u03bc) and let A be a\nBorel subset of X. Then we can find a Borel map f : GA \u2192 G such that\n(i) s(f (x)) = x and r(f (x)) \u2208 A for a.e. x \u2208 GA;\n(ii) f (x) = ex \u2208 Gxx for a.e. x \u2208 A, where Gxx = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : r(\u03b3) = s(\u03b3) = x} and\nex is the identity element of the isotropy group Gxx .\nLemma 2.13. Let G be an r-discrete measured groupoid on (X, \u03bc) and let S be a\nnormal subgroupoid of G. If A is a Borel subset of X with positive measure, then\n(S)A is normal in (G)A .\nProof. Let {\u03c6n } be a family of normal choice functions for the pair (G, S). We\nwrite B = SA and\nDn = {x \u2208 A \u2229 dom(\u03c6n ) : r(\u03c6n (x)) \u2208 B}.\nDefine a Borel map \u03c6\u2032n : Dn \u2192 (G)A by \u03c6\u2032n (x) = f (r(\u03c6n (x)))\u03c6n (x) for x \u2208 Dn ,\nwhere f : B \u2192 S is a Borel map given by Lemma 2.12 such that\n\u2022 s(f (x)) = x and r(f (x)) \u2208 A for a.e. x \u2208 B = SA;\n\u2022 f (x) = ex \u2208 Sxx for a.e. x \u2208 A.\nWe show that {\u03c6\u2032n } is a family of normal choice functions for ((G)A , (S)A ). Since\n\u2032\n\u03c6n is the composition of \u03c6n and f , we see that \u03c6\u2032n \u2208 EndS (G). Let \u03b3 \u2208 (G)A .\nThen there exists \u03c6n such that r(\u03b3) \u2208 dom(\u03c6n ) and \u03c6n (r(\u03b3))\u03b3 \u2208 S. Note that\nr(\u03b3) \u2208 A \u2229 dom(\u03c6n ) and r(\u03c6n (r(\u03b3))) = r(\u03c6n (r(\u03b3))\u03b3) \u2208 SA. Therefore, r(\u03b3) \u2208 Dn\nand\n\u03c6\u2032n (r(\u03b3))\u03b3 = f (r(\u03c6n (r(\u03b3))))\u03c6n (r(\u03b3))\u03b3 \u2208 (S)A ,\nwhich completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.14. Let G be a discrete group generated by two subgroups G1 , G2 so\nthat G1 is normal in G and assume that we have a non-singular action of G on\na standard finite measure space (X, \u03bc). We denote by G, G1 and G2 the groupoids\narising from the actions of G, G1 and G2 , respectively. Let A \u2282 X be a Borel subset\nwith positive measure. Then (G1 )A is normal in the subgroupoid H = (G1 )A \u2228 (G2 )A\nof (G)A generated by the two subgroupoids (G1 )A and (G2 )A .\nProof. For each i = 1, 2 and g \u2208 Gi , define Ag = A \u2229 g \u22121 A and \u03c8g : Ag \u2192 (G)A\nby \u03c8g (x) = (g, x) for x \u2208 Ag . It is easy to check that \u03c8g \u2208 End(G1 )A (H). For\neach word \u03c9 of elements in G1 and G2 , we can naturally define the composition\n\u03c8\u03c9 \u2208 End(G1 )A (H) of \u03c8g . It is clear that {\u03c8\u03c9 }\u03c9 forms a family of normal choice\nfunctions for (H, (G1 )A ).\n\u0003\n3. Actions of some discrete groups\n3.1. Actions of the mapping class group. In Sections 4 and 5, we consider\nmainly the groupoid generated by an action of the mapping class group and its\nsubgroupoids. In this subsection, we collect some results about them. Most of the\n\n\f12\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nfollowing results can be shown in the same way as in [25], where we assume that\nthe action is essentially free.\nDefinition 3.1. An r-discrete measured groupoid G on (X, \u03bc) is said to be of\ninfinite type if there exists a Borel partition X = A1 \u2294 A2 such that\n(i) for a.e. x \u2208 A1 , the isotropy group Gxx is infinite;\n(ii) the associated principal groupoid of (G)A2 defined by\n{(r(\u03b3), s(\u03b3)) \u2208 A2 \u00d7 A2 : \u03b3 \u2208 (G)A2 }\nis recurrent.\nNote that for any n \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}, the subset\nXn = {x \u2208 X : |Gxx | = n}\nis measurable and satisfies GXn = Xn .\nLet G be an r-discrete measured groupoid on (X, \u03bc) and let \u03c1 : G \u2192 G be a\ngroupoid homomorphism into a standard Borel group G. Let S be a Borel Gspace. Recall that a Borel map \u03c6 : A \u2192 S from a Borel subset A \u2282 X is said to\nbe \u03c1-invariant (or invariant for simplicity) for G if \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03c6(s(\u03b3)) = \u03c6(r(\u03b3)) for a.e.\n\u03b3 \u2208 (G)A .\nLemma 3.1. In the above situation, let us define a Borel map \u03c6\u2032 : GA \u2192 S by\n\u03c6\u2032 (x) = \u03c1(f (x)\u22121 )\u03c6(r(f (x))) for x \u2208 GA, where f : GA \u2192 G is a Borel map constructed in Lemma 2.12. Then \u03c6\u2032 is also \u03c1-invariant for G.\nProof. Let \u03b3 \u2208 (G)GA and put y = r(\u03b3), x = s(\u03b3) \u2208 GA. Then\n\u03c1(\u03b3)\u03c6\u2032 (x) = \u03c1(f (y)\u22121 )\u03c1(f (y)\u03b3f (x)\u22121 )\u03c6(r(f (x)))\n= \u03c1(f (y)\u22121 )\u03c6(r(f (y))) = \u03c6\u2032 (y)\nsince f (y)\u03b3f (x)\u22121 \u2208 (G)A and r(f (y)\u03b3f (x)\u22121 ) = r(f (y)).\n\n\u0003\n\nAssumption 3.1. We call the following assumption (\u22c6): let \u0393 be a subgroup of\n\u0393(M ; m), where M is a surface with \u03ba(M ) > 0 and m \u2265 3 is an integer. Let (X, \u03bc)\nbe a standard finite measure space. We assume that there exists a non-singular\naction of \u0393 on (X, \u03bc) generating the groupoid\nG = G\u0393 = {(\u03b3, x) \u2208 \u0393 \u00d7 X : \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, x \u2208 X}.\nand the induced cocycle\n\u03c1 : G \u2192 \u0393, (\u03b3, x) 7\u2192 \u03b3\nfor \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and a.e. x \u2208 X.\nUnder the above assumption, we often use the following notation:\n\u2022 For a subgroup \u0393\u2032 of \u0393, let G\u0393\u2032 denote the subgroupoid of G generated by\nthe action of \u0393\u2032 .\n\u2022 For \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ), we denote by D\u03c3 the intersection of \u0393 and the subgroup\ngenerated by Dehn twists about all curves in \u03c3. We write G\u03c3 instead of\nGD\u03c3 for simplicity. If \u03c3 consists of one element \u03b1 \u2208 V (C), then we write\nD\u03b1 (resp. G\u03b1 ) instead of D\u03c3 (resp. G\u03c3 ).\nAs in [25], we can consider two types of subgroupoids of infinite type, following\nthe classification of subgroups of \u0393(M ) mentioned in Subsection 2.1. We denote by\nM (PMF) the space of all probability measures on PMF.\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n13\n\nTheorem 3.2 ([25, Theorem 4.41]). Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a\nBorel subset with positive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite\ntype. If we have an invariant Borel map \u03c6 : Y \u2192 M (PMF) for S, then there exists\na Borel partition Y = Y1 \u2294 Y2 satisfying the following:\n(i) \u03c6(x)(MIN ) = 1 for a.e. x \u2208 Y1 ;\n(ii) \u03c6(x)(PMF \\ MIN ) = 1 for a.e. x \u2208 Y2 .\nIn the above theorem, remark that both Y1 and Y2 are invariant for S and if Y \u2032\nis a Borel subset of Y with positive measure and \u03c8 : Y \u2032 \u2192 M (PMF) is another\ninvariant Borel map for S, then \u03c8 satisfies\n(i) \u03c8(x)(MIN ) = 1 for a.e. x \u2208 Y1 \u2229 Y \u2032 ;\n(ii) \u03c8(x)(PMF \\ MIN ) = 1 for a.e. x \u2208 Y2 \u2229 Y \u2032 ,\nwhere Y1 , Y2 are Borel subsets as in the above theorem. Hence, it is natural to give\nthe following definition:\nDefinition 3.2. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a Borel subset with\npositive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type.\n(i) If we have an invariant Borel map \u03c6 : Y \u2192 M (PMF) for S such that\n\u03c6(x)(MIN ) = 1 for a.e. x \u2208 Y , then S is said to be irreducible and\namenable (or IA in short).\n(ii) If we have an invariant Borel map \u03c6 : Y \u2192 M (PMF) for S such that\n\u03c6(x)(PMF \\ MIN ) = 1 for a.e. x \u2208 Y , then S is said to be reducible.\nWe have explained in Section 1 that the key ingredient of the proof of Theorem\n1.1 is to construct an essentially unique almost \u0393(M ) \u00d7 \u0393(M )-equivariant Borel\nmap \u03a6 : \u03a3 \u2192 Aut(C) for a self ME coupling (\u03a3, m) of \u0393(M ). We give a rough\noutline of the construction of the map \u03a6. In [25], we developed the theory of\nrecurrent subrelations of an equivalence relation arising from a standard action of\nthe mapping class group. Thanks to it, we can divide such subrelations into two\ntypes, irreducible and amenable (IA) ones and reducible ones as in Theorem 3.2\nand Definition 3.2. The notion of normal subrelations also played an important role\nin the classification theorem of [25]. In what follows in this section, we generalize\nvarious central results in [25] about the above subrelations to the case where the\naction of the mapping class group is not necessarily essentially free. In this case,\nalthough we need to consider r-discrete measured groupoids arising from group\nactions, the proof can be proceeded along the same line.\nIn Section 4, using various results in this section, we characterize a reducible subgroupoid in terms of amenability, non-amenability and normality (see Propositions\n4.1, 4.2). Note that these three properties are preserved under an isomorphism\nbetween two groupoids, and that as mentioned in Subsection 2.3, considering a\nself ME coupling of \u0393(M ) is almost equivalent to considering an isomorphism f\nbetween two groupoids G1 , G2 arising from measure-preserving actions of \u0393(M ).\nThanks to the characterization of a reducible subgroupoid, we see that the image\nof a reducible subgroupoid of G1 via f is also reducible. Moreover, maximal reducible subgroupoids are mapped to maximal ones by f (see Corollary 4.5, Lemma\n4.6 and Corollary 4.7).\nLet G be the groupoid associated with a measure-preserving action of \u0393(M ) on\na standard finite measure space (X, \u03bc). As a next stage, in Section 5, we study an\namenable normal subgroupoid S of infinite type of a maximal reducible subgroupoid\n\n\f14\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nof G. We can show that S is contained in the groupoid generated by the action of a\nDehn twist about some simple closed curve on M up to a countable Borel partition\nof X (see Lemma 5.1). Conversely, the subgroupoid generated by the action of\na Dehn twist about a simple closed curve is normal in some maximal reducible\nsubgroupoid of G. It follows that roughly speaking, the subgroupoid generated\nby a Dehn twist about a simple closed curve can be characterized in terms of\namenability, non-amenability and normality, and in the situation of the previous\nparagraph, we see that such subgroupoids are preserved by f . This means that\nf induces a bijection of the set V (C) of all isotopy classes of simple closed curves\non M , which is shown to be an automorphism of the curve complex. Translating\nthis fact into structural information on a self ME coupling (\u03a3, m) of \u0393(M ), we can\nconstruct an almost \u0393(M ) \u00d7 \u0393(M )-equivariant Borel map \u03a6 from \u03a3 into Aut(C)\nas mentioned in Section 1.\nRemark 3.1. When \u03ba(M ) > 0 and M 6= M1,2 , M2,0 , Ivanov [23, Section 8.5] showed\nthat any isomorphism from a finite index subgroup of \u0393(M )\u22c4 into a finite index\nsubgroup of \u0393(M )\u22c4 is the restriction of a unique inner automorphism of \u0393(M )\u22c4 . A\nkey ingredient of his proof is to show that such an isomorphism f maps sufficiently\nhigh powers of Dehn twists into powers of Dehn twists by characterizing a (power\nof) Dehn twist algebraically (see [23, Theorem 7.5.B]). It follows that f yields a\nbijection on the set V (C), which is, in fact, an automorphism of the curve complex.\nThis automorphism comes from an element g in \u0393(M )\u22c4 by Ivanov's theorem (see\nTheorem 2.5). After an easy computation shown in the proof of Theorem 8.5.A in\n[23], we can prove that f is the restriction of the inner automorphism of \u0393(M ) by\nconjugation with g. Our construction of the map \u03a6 mentioned above relies heavily\non this idea due to Ivanov.\nRemark 3.2. Note that if we only want to prove Theorem 1.1, then it is not necessary\nto generalize the results in [25] to the case where the standard action of the mapping\nclass group is not necessarily essentially free because in general, when two discrete\ngroups \u039b1 , \u039b2 are measure equivalent, there exists a ME coupling of \u039b1 and \u039b2\nsuch that the \u039b1 \u00d7 \u039b2 -action on it is essentially free, which induces weakly orbit\nequivalence between standard actions of \u039b1 and \u039b2 . However, in Theorem 1.4,\nwe need to consider a ME coupling of \u0393(M ) such that the \u0393(M ) \u00d7 \u0393(M )-action\nis not necessarily essentially free. Moreover, thanks to the generalization, we can\nobtain some information about stabilizers of measure-preserving actions of \u0393(M )\n(see Corollaries 3.9 and 3.17).\nIn the following theorems, we collect basic properties of the two types of subgroupoids of a groupoid generated by an action of the mapping class group, which\nare called IA and reducible subgroupoids, respectively. First, we consider IA subgroupoids.\nSince the curve complex C is a hyperbolic metric space [29], we can construct\nthe boundary \u2202C at infinity, which is non-empty (see [18], [27] or [25, Section 3.2]).\nLet \u22022 C be the quotient space of \u2202C \u00d7 \u2202C by the coordinate exchanging action of\nthe symmetric group of two letters and let M (\u2202C) be the space of all probability\nmeasures on \u2202C, which has the Borel structure introduced in the comment before\nProposition 4.30 in [25]. Each element in \u22022 C can naturally be viewed as an atomic\nmeasure in M (\u2202C) so that each atom has measure 1 or 1/2. Then \u22022 C is a Borel\nsubset of M (\u2202C).\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n15\n\nUnder the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a Borel subset with positive measure\nand let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type. Note that if S is IA, then we can\nconstruct an invariant Borel map Y \u2192 M (\u2202C) for S by using the \u0393(M )-equivariant\nmap MIN \u2192 \u2202C, which is constructed in [27] (see also [18]).\nProposition 3.3 ([25, Proposition 4.32 (ii), Corollary 4.43]). Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a Borel subset with positive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type. Suppose that S admits a \u03c1-invariant Borel map\n\u03c6 : Y \u2192 M (\u2202C). Then the cardinality of supp(\u03c6(x)) is at most 2 for a.e. x \u2208 Y\nand S is IA.\nTheorem 3.4 ([25, Section 4.4.1, Lemma 4.58]). Under the assumption (\u22c6), let\nY \u2282 X be a Borel subset with positive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y\nof infinite type. Suppose that S is IA. Then\n(i) there exists an essentially unique invariant Borel map \u03c60 : Y \u2192 \u22022 C for S\nsatisfying the following: if Y \u2032 is a Borel subset of Y with positive measure\nand \u03c6 : Y \u2032 \u2192 M (\u2202C) is an invariant Borel map for S, then\nsupp(\u03c6(x)) \u2282 supp(\u03c60 (x))\nfor a.e. x \u2208 Y \u2032 , where supp(\u03bd) denotes the support of a measure \u03bd.\n(ii) if T is a subgroupoid of (G)Y with S \u22b3 T , then \u03c60 is invariant also for T .\n(iii) the groupoid S is amenable.\nIf X is a point and G is isomorphic to \u0393, then the above facts follow from the\nclassification of subgroups of \u0393(M ) described in Subsection 2.1. In this case, using\nproperties of pseudo-Anosov elements, we can prove that S is virtually cyclic, which\nimplies Theorem 3.4 (iii). To prove Theorem 3.4 (iii) in a general case, we need to\nuse the amenability in a measurable sense of the action of \u0393(M ) on \u2202C (or \u22022 C).\nRemark 3.3. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a Borel subset with positive\nmeasure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type. It follows from Theorem\n3.2 that there exists an essentially unique Borel partition Y = Y1 \u2294Y2 \u2294Y3 satisfying\nthe following:\n\u2022 if Y1 has positive measure, then (S)Y1 is IA;\n\u2022 if Y2 has positive measure, then (S)Y2 is reducible;\n\u2022 if Y3 has positive measure, then (S)Y3\u2032 admits no invariant Borel maps\nY3\u2032 \u2192 M (PMF) for any Borel subset Y3\u2032 of Y3 with positive measure.\nIf S is amenable and any restriction of S to a Borel subset of Y with positive\nmeasure is not reducible, then S is IA, and the converse also holds by Theorem 3.4.\nNext, we recall basic properties of reducible subgroupoids. We can define the\ncanonical reduction system for a reducible subgroupoid as in the case of a reducible\nsubgroup.\nDefinition 3.3. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a Borel subset with\npositive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type. Let A be a\nBorel subset of Y with positive measure and let \u03b1 \u2208 V (C).\n(i) We say that the pairF(\u03b1, A) is \u03c1-invariant for S if there exists a countable\nBorel partition A = An of A such that the constant map An \u2192 {\u03b1} is\ninvariant for S for each n.\n\n\f16\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\n(ii) Suppose that (\u03b1, A) is \u03c1-invariant for S. The pair (\u03b1, A) is said to be purely\n\u03c1-invariant if (\u03b2, B) is not \u03c1-invariant for S for any Borel subset B of A\nwith positive measure and any \u03b2 \u2208 V (C) with i(\u03b1, \u03b2) 6= 0. (In [25], we call\nthis pair an essential \u03c1-invariant one for S.)\nSince we consider a countable Borel partition in the definition of a \u03c1-invariant\npair, we can easily show that if there are \u03b1 \u2208 V (C) and a Borel subset An \u2282 Y for\nn \u2208 N with\nS (\u03b1, An ) \u03c1-invariant for S (or purely \u03c1-invariant, respectively), then the\npair (\u03b1, An ) is also \u03c1-invariant for S (or purely \u03c1-invariant, respectively) by [25,\nLemma 4.47]. It follows that for each \u03b1 \u2208 V (C), we can find an essentially maximal\nBorel subset A\u03b1 \u2282 Y such that (\u03b1, A\u03b1 ) is \u03c1-invariant for S (or purely \u03c1-invariant,\nrespectively) unless there exist no \u03c1-invariant pairs for S (or purely \u03c1-invariant,\nrespectively).\nTheorem 3.5 ([25, Section 4.5, Lemma 4.60]). Under the assumption (\u22c6), let\nY \u2282 X be a Borel subset with positive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y\nof infinite type. Suppose that S is reducible. Then\n(i) there exists a purely \u03c1-invariant pair for S.\n(ii) we can define an essentially unique invariant Borel map \u03c6 : Y \u2192 S(M ) for\nS so that\n(a) if \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) satisfies \u03bc(\u03c6\u22121 (\u03c3)) > 0 and \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c3, then (\u03b1, \u03c6\u22121 (\u03c3)) is a\npurely \u03c1-invariant pair for S;\n(b) if (\u03b1, A) is a purely \u03c1-invariant pair for S, then\n\u03bc(A \\ \u03c6\u22121 ({\u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) : \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c3})) = 0.\n(iii) if T is a subgroupoid of (G)Y with S \u22b3 T , then \u03c6 is invariant also for T .\nNote that we can construct \u03c6 in Theorem 3.5 (ii) from (i) by the observation\nright before Theorem 3.5. We call \u03c6 in the above theorem the canonical reduction\nsystem (CRS) for S. It is easy to see that if A is a Borel subset of Y with positive\nmeasure, then the CRS for (S)A is the restriction of \u03c6 to A (see [25, Lemma 4.53\n(iii)]). If X is a point and G is isomorphic to \u0393, then the above definition of the\nCRS for S coincides with the one mentioned in Subsection 2.1.\nIn the following two lemmas, we study the CRS's for certain reducible subgroupoids arising from the actions of reducible subgroups.\nLemma 3.6. Under the assumption (\u22c6), suppose that the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is\nmeasure-preserving. Let G be an infinite reducible subgroup of \u0393 and let \u03c3 \u2208 S(M )\nbe the CRS for G. Then GG is reducible and its CRS \u03c6 : X \u2192 S(M ) is constant\nwith value \u03c3.\nProof. It is clear that GG is reducible and for any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c3, the pair (\u03b1, X) is \u03c1invariant for GG . Assume that there exists \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c3 such that the pair (\u03b1, X) is not\npurely \u03c1-invariant for GG . Then we would have a Borel subset B of X with positive\nmeasure and \u03b2 \u2208 V (C) with i(\u03b1, \u03b2) 6= 0 such that (\u03b2, B) is a \u03c1-invariant pair\nfor GG . It follows that there exists a Borel subset B \u2032 of B with positive measure\nsuch that \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03b2 = \u03b2 for a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (GG )B \u2032 . We can find g \u2208 G of infinite order\nwith g\u03b2 6= \u03b2 since \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c3. Since g has infinite order and the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc)\npreserves the finite positive measure \u03bc, the subgroupoid (Ghgi )B \u2032 is of infinite type,\nwhere hgi denotes the cyclic subgroup generated by g. We can find a Borel subset\nB1\u2032 \u2282 B \u2032 with positive measure and n \u2208 Z \\ {0} such that (g n , x) \u2208 (Ghgi )B \u2032 for any\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n17\n\nx \u2208 B1\u2032 . Thus, g n \u03b2 = \u03c1(g n , x)\u03b2 = \u03b2 holds for any x \u2208 B1\u2032 . Since G is a subgroup\nof \u0393(M ; m), it follows from Theorem 2.1 that g k \u03b2 = \u03b2 for any k \u2208 Z \\ {0}, which\nis a contradiction. Thus, (\u03b1, X) is a purely \u03c1-invariant pair for GG and we see that\n\u03c3 is contained in \u03c6(x) for a.e. x \u2208 X.\nNext, assume that we have a Borel subset A of X with positive measure and\n\u03b2 \u2208 \u03c6(x) \\ \u03c3 for any x \u2208 A. For each g \u2208 G, there is a Borel subset A1 \u2282 A\nwith positive measure and n \u2208 Z \\ {0} such that (g n , x) \u2208 (GG )A1 and the equation\ng n \u03b2 = \u03c1(g n , x)\u03b2 = \u03b2 holds for any x \u2208 A1 because (\u03b2, A) is a \u03c1-invariant pair for\nGG . Thus, g\u03b2 = \u03b2 for any g \u2208 G by Theorem 2.1. It follows from \u03b2 6\u2208 \u03c3 that there\nexists \u03b3 \u2208 V (C) such that i(\u03b2, \u03b3) 6= 0 and h\u03b3 = \u03b3 for any h \u2208 G. Thus, (\u03b3, X) is\na \u03c1-invariant pair for GG , which contradicts the assumption that \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c6(x) for any\nx \u2208 A, that is, the pair (\u03b2, A) is pure.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.7. Under the assumption (\u22c6), suppose that the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is\nmeasure-preserving. Let \u03b1 \u2208 V (C) and assume that the subgroup D\u03b1 is infinite.\nLet Y be a Borel subset of X with positive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of\n(G\u03b1 )Y of infinite type. Then S is reducible and its CRS for S is constant with value\n{\u03b1}.\nProof. It is clear that S is reducible and the pair (\u03b1, Y ) is \u03c1-invariant for S. Let\nA be a Borel subset of Y with positive measure and \u03b2 \u2208 V (C) with i(\u03b1, \u03b2) 6= 0.\nAssume that the pair (\u03b2, A) is \u03c1-invariant for S. Then there exists a Borel subset\nB of A with positive measure such that \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03b2 = \u03b2 for a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (S)B . Since S is a\nsubgroupoid of (G\u03b1 )Y of infinite type, there exist infinitely many n \u2208 Z and a Borel\nsubset Bn of B with positive measure such that tn \u2208 \u0393 and (tn , x) \u2208 (S)B for any\nx \u2208 Bn , where t \u2208 \u0393(M ) denotes a Dehn twist about \u03b1. Hence, tn \u03b2 = \u03c1(tn , x)\u03b2 = \u03b2\nfor a.e. x \u2208 Bn . In particular, tn \u03b2 = \u03b2 for infinitely many n \u2208 Z. It follows from\n[21, Lemma 4.2] (or [25, Corollary 4.26]) that i(\u03b1, \u03b2) = 0, which is a contradiction.\nThus, the pair (\u03b1, Y ) is a pure \u03c1-invariant one for S.\nIf \u03b3 \u2208 V (C) satisfies i(\u03b1, \u03b3) = 0 and \u03b1 6= \u03b3, then there exists \u03b4 \u2208 V (C) such\nthat i(\u03b1, \u03b4) = 0 and i(\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= 0. Since the pair (\u03b4, Y ) is \u03c1-invariant for S, the pair\n(\u03b3, A\u2032 ) can not be a pure \u03c1-invariant one for S for any Borel subset A\u2032 of Y .\n\u0003\nThe following proposition can also be proved along the same line as in [25]:\nProposition 3.8 ([25, Proposition 4.61]). Under the assumption (\u22c6), suppose that\nthe \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measure-preserving and that \u0393 is sufficiently large. Then\n(G)Y is neither IA nor reducible for any Borel subset Y \u2282 X with positive measure.\nAs an application of the above generalization of the results in [25], we obtain\nsome information on stabilizers for a measure-preserving action of the mapping\nclass group on a standard finite measure space.\nCorollary 3.9. Under the assumption (\u22c6), suppose that the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is\nmeasure-preserving and that \u0393 is sufficiently large. Then the isotropy group\nGxx = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : r(\u03b3) = s(\u03b3) = x}\nis either trivial or sufficiently large for a.e. x \u2208 X.\nWe can show this corollary by using Lemma 2.11, Theorem 3.4 (ii), Theorem 3.5\n(iii) and Proposition 3.8. Note that \u0393 is torsion-free and that\n\n\f18\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\n\u2022 for each pseudo-Anosov element g \u2208 \u0393, the subset of X consisting of x \u2208 X\nsuch that Gxx is IA and fixes the pair {F\u00b1 (g)} of pseudo-Anosov foliations\nis measurable;\n\u2022 for each \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ), the subset of X consisting of x \u2208 X such that Gxx is\nreducible and its CRS is \u03c3 is measurable.\nIt follows from these remarks that for a Borel subset Y of X with positive measure,\nboth subsets\nY1 = {x \u2208 Y : Gxx is IA}, Y2 = {x \u2208 Y : Gxx is reducible}\nare measurable, and (G0 )Y1 is IA and (G0 )Y2 is reducible, where\nG0 = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : r(\u03b3) = s(\u03b3)}\nis the isotropy groupoid of G.\nIn order to analyze reducible subgroupoids furthermore, in Theorems 3.11, 3.13,\nwe consider components of the surface obtained by cutting along the CRS for S.\nThere are three types of components as in the case of subgroups of \u0393(M ; m) mentioned in the comment right before Lemma 2.3. These theorems will be used when\nwe characterize reducible subgroupoids in terms of amenability, non-amenability\nand normality (see Section 4).\nIf \u0393 is an infinite reducible subgroup of \u0393(M ; m) with an integer m \u2265 3 and\n\u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) is the CRS for \u0393, then we can classify each component Q of M\u03c3 in\nterms of properties of the quotients pQ (\u0393) (i.e., triviality and amenability), where\npQ : \u0393 \u2192 \u0393(Q) is the natural homomorphism (see the comment right before Lemma\n2.3). On the other hand, when we consider a reducible subgroupoid, we cannot\nconstruct such a quotient. However, fortunately, the properties of the quotient\npQ (\u0393) used in the classification of Q can be characterized in terms of fixed points\nfor the action of pQ (\u0393) on the space M (PMF(Q)) of all probability measures on\nPMF(Q) as follows:\n(a) Q is T for \u0393 if and only if either Q is a pair of pants or pQ (g)\u03b1 = \u03b1 for any\ng \u2208 \u0393 and any (or some) \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(Q)).\n(b) Q is IA for \u0393 if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022 Q is not a pair of pants;\n\u2022 pQ (g)\u03b1 6= \u03b1 for any non-trivial g \u2208 \u0393 and any (or some) \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(Q));\n\u2022 there exists \u03bc \u2208 M (PMF(Q)) such that pQ (g)\u03bc = \u03bc for any g \u2208 \u0393\nand \u03bc(MIN (Q)) = 1.\n(c) Q is IN for \u0393 if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022 Q is not a pair of pants;\n\u2022 there exist no fixed points for the action of pQ (\u0393) on M (PMF(Q)).\nBy this observation, we can similarly consider three types of components of the\nsurface obtained by cutting along the CRS for a reducible subgroupoid. Before\nstating the definition of the three types of components, we recall some notation.\nLet L be a submanifold of the surface M which is a realization of some element\nin S(M ). Let Q be a component of ML , where ML denotes the surface obtained by\ncutting M along L. Let pL : ML \u2192 M denote the canonical map. For \u03b4 \u2208 V (C(M )),\nwe define a finite subset r(\u03b4, Q) of V (C(Q)).\nLet \u03b4 \u2208 V (C(M )) and represent the isotopy class \u03b4 by a circle D that intersects\neach of the components of L in the least possible number of points. Put DL =\np\u22121\nL (D). The manifold DL consists of some intervals or it is a circle (if D \u2229 L = \u2205).\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n19\n\nIf either DL \u2229 Q = \u2205 or DL is a circle which lies in Q and is peripheral for Q,\nthen put r(\u03b4, Q) = \u2205. If DL is a non-peripheral circle lying in Q, put r(\u03b4, Q) = {\u03b4}.\nIn the remaining cases, the intersection DL \u2229 Q consists of some intervals. For\neach such interval I, consider a regular neighborhood in Q of the union of the\ninterval I and those components of \u2202Q on which the ends of I lie. Let NI denote\nthe regular neighborhood. Then NI is a disk with two holes. Let r\u2032 (\u03b4, Q) be the set\nof isotopy classes of components of the manifolds \u2202NI \\ \u2202Q, where I runs through\nthe set of all components of DL \u2229Q. Define r(\u03b4, Q) as the resulting set of discarding\nfrom r\u2032 (\u03b4, Q) the isotopy classes of trivial or peripheral circles of Q. We will regard\nr(\u03b4, Q) as a subset of V (C(M )) using the embedding V (C(Q)) \u0592\u2192 V (C(M )). It is\nclear that this definition depends only on \u03b4 and the isotopy class of Q.\nLet F : M \u2192 M be a diffeomorphism such that F (L) = L and the induced\ndiffeomorphism ML \u2192 ML takes Q to Q. If f \u2208 \u0393(M ) denotes the isotopy class of\nF , then we have the equality\nf (r(\u03b4, Q)) = r(f \u03b4, Q)\nby definition.\nLemma 3.10 ([21, Lemma 7.9]). Let L and Q be the same as above and let \u03b4 \u2208\nV (C(M )). If r(\u03b4, Q) = \u2205, then one of the following three cases occurs:\n(i) there is a circle in the class \u03b4 that does not intersect Q;\n(ii) \u03b4 is the isotopy class of one of the components of L;\n(iii) Q is a disk with two holes.\nWe denote by D = D(M ) the set of all isotopy classes of subsurfaces in M and\ndenote by F0 (D) the set of all finite subsets F of D (including the empty set) such\nthat if Q1 , Q2 \u2208 F and Q1 6= Q2 , then Q1 and Q2 can be realized disjointly on M .\nTheorem 3.11 ([25, Theorem 5.6]). Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a\nBorel subset with positive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite\ntype. Suppose that S is reducible and let \u03c6 : Y \u2192 S(M ) be its CRS. Then there exist\ntwo essentially unique invariant Borel maps \u03c6t , \u03c6i : Y \u2192 F0 (D) for S satisfying the\nfollowing:\n(i) any element in \u03c6t (x) \u222a \u03c6i (x) is a component of M\u03c6(x) for a.e. x \u2208 Y ;\n(ii) each component of M\u03c6(x) belongs to \u03c6t (x) \u222a \u03c6i (x) and \u03c6t (x) \u2229 \u03c6i (x) = \u2205\nfor a.e. x \u2208 Y ;\n(iii) if Q is in F \u2208 F0 (D) with \u03bc(\u03c6\u22121\nt (F )) > 0, then either Q is a pair of pants\nor the pair (\u03b1, \u03c6\u22121\n(F\n))\nis\n\u03c1-invariant\nfor S for any \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(Q));\nt\n(iv) if Q is in F \u2208 F0 (D) with \u03bc(\u03c6\u22121\n(F\n))\n> 0, then Q is not a pair of pants\ni\nand (\u03b1, A) is not \u03c1-invariant for S for any \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(M )) with r(\u03b1, Q) 6= \u2205\nand any Borel subset A \u2282 \u03c6\u22121\ni (F ) with positive measure.\nWe call \u03c6t (resp. \u03c6i ) the system of trivial (resp. irreducible) subsurfaces for\nS or in short, a T (resp.

When we\nidentify a subsurface with a component of the surface obtained by cutting along\nsome curves, we call T and I subsurfaces also T and I components, respectively. It\nis easy to see that if A is a Borel subset of Y with positive measure, then the T, I\nsystems for (S)A are the restrictions of \u03c6t , \u03c6i to A, respectively (see [25, Lemma\n5.7]). We can show that T components have the following stronger property:\n\n\f20\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nLemma 3.12 ([25, Lemma 5.4]).

We assume the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 \u03c6 is constant with value \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) and Q is a component of M\u03c3 ;\n\u2022 we have \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(M )) with r(\u03b1, Q) 6= \u2205 and a Borel subset A \u2282 Y with\npositive measure such that (\u03b1, A) is \u03c1-invariant for S.\nF\nThen there exists a countable Borel partition A = An such that \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03b2 = \u03b2 for\nany \u03b2 \u2208 V (C(Q)) and a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (S)An . In particular, the pair (\u03b2, A) is \u03c1-invariant\nfor S for any curve \u03b2 \u2208 V (C(Q)).\nIf the cocycle \u03c1 : S \u2192 \u0393 is essentially valued in \u0393\u03c3 = {g \u2208 \u0393 : g\u03c3 = \u03c3} for\nsome \u03c3 and Q is a component of M\u03c3 , then \u03c1Q denotes the cocycle defined by the\ncomposition of \u03c1 with pQ : \u0393\u03c3 \u2192 \u0393(Q). In the next theorem, we further divide I\nsubsurfaces into two types, IA and IN ones.\nTheorem 3.13 ([25, Theorem 5.9, Section 5.2]). In Theorem 3.11, there exist two\nessentially unique invariant Borel maps \u03c6ia , \u03c6in : Y \u2192 F0 (D) for S satisfying the\nfollowing:\n(i) \u03c6i (x) = \u03c6ia (x) \u222a \u03c6in (x) and \u03c6ia (x) \u2229 \u03c6in (x) = \u2205 for a.e. x \u2208 Y ;\n(ii) if Q is in F \u2208 F0 (D) with \u03bc(\u03c6\u22121\nia (F )) > 0, then\n(a) if A is a Borel subset of \u03c6\u22121\nia (F ) with positive measure and \u03c8 : A \u2192\nM (PMF(Q)) is a \u03c1Q -invariant Borel map for S, then we see that\n\u03c8(x)(MIN (Q)) = 1 for a.e. x \u2208 A;\n(b) we have an essentially unique \u03c1Q -invariant Borel map \u03c80 : \u03c6\u22121\nia (F ) \u2192\n\u22022 C(Q) for S such that if A is a Borel subset of \u03c6\u22121\n(F\n)\nwith\npositive\nia\nmeasure and \u03c8 : A \u2192 M (\u2202C(Q)) is a \u03c1Q -invariant Borel map for S,\nthen\nsupp(\u03c8(x)) \u2282 supp(\u03c80 (x))\nfor a.e. x \u2208 A;\n(iii) if Q is in F \u2208 F0 (D) with \u03bc(\u03c6\u22121\nin (F )) > 0, then S admits neither \u03c1Q invariant Borel maps A \u2192 M (PMF(Q)) nor A \u2192 \u22022 C(Q) for any Borel\nsubset A \u2282 \u03c6\u22121\nin (F ) with positive measure.\nWe call \u03c6ia (resp. \u03c6in ) the system of irreducible and amenable or IA (resp.\nirreducible and non-amenable or IN) subsurfaces for S. We often call an element\nin \u03c6ia (x) (resp. \u03c6in (x)) an irreducible and amenable (resp. irreducible and nonamenable) subsurface for x \u2208 Y and in short, an IA (resp.

It is easy to see that if A is a Borel subset of Y with positive measure,\nthen the IA, IN systems for (S)A are the restrictions of \u03c6ia , \u03c6in to A, respectively\n(see [25, Lemma 5.10]).\nWe recall some properties of IA components in the following lemma:\nLemma 3.14 ([25, Lemma 5.13]).

Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X\nbe a Borel subset with positive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite\ntype. Suppose that S is reducible and there exists \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) such that \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03c3 = \u03c3\nfor a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 S.

Let p\u03c3 : \u0393 \u2192 Q \u0393(Q) be the product\nQ\nQ pQ , where Q runs through all components in M\u03c3 . Note that the kernel of p\u03c3 is\ncontained in the amenable subgroup of \u0393(M ) generated by Dehn twists about all\ncurves in \u03c3 by Lemma 2.2. Thus, it is easily shown that if every component of M\u03c3\nis either T or IA, then \u0393 is amenable, which implies Proposition 3.15 in the case\nwhere X is a point.\n3.2. Actions of hyperbolic groups. In this subsection, we consider subgroupoids\nof a groupoid defined by a non-singular action of a hyperbolic group. In subsequent\nsections, we only use Lemma 3.18, in which we consider a groupoid arising from an\naction of a free group of rank 2.\nAssumption 3.2. We call the following assumption (\u22c6)h : let \u0393 be an infinite\nsubgroup of a hyperbolic group \u03930 . Let (X, \u03bc) be a standard finite measure space\nand assume that we have a non-singular \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc). We denote by G = \u0393\u22c9X\nand \u03c1 : G \u2192 \u0393 the associated groupoid and cocycle, respectively.\nFor a hyperbolic group \u03930 , let \u2202\u03930 be the boundary at infinity and let M (\u2202\u03930 )\nbe the space of all probability measures on \u2202\u03930 . We denote by \u22022 \u03930 the quotient\nspace of \u2202\u03930 \u00d7 \u2202\u03930 by the coordinate exchanging action of the symmetric group of\ntwo letters, which can naturally be viewed as a Borel subset of M (\u2202\u03930 ) as in the\ncase of the boundary of the curve complex. We can show the following proposition\nwith the methods from the proof of Theorem 3.4:\nProposition 3.16. Under the assumption (\u22c6)h , let Y be a Borel subset of X with\npositive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type. Assume that\nthere is a \u03c1-invariant Borel map Y \u2192 M (\u2202\u03930 ) for S. Then\n(i) there exists an essentially unique \u03c1-invariant Borel map \u03c60 : Y \u2192 \u22022 \u03930 for\nS satisfying the following: if Y \u2032 is a Borel subset of Y with positive measure\nand \u03c6 : Y \u2032 \u2192 M (\u2202\u03930 ) is a \u03c1-invariant Borel map for S, then\nsupp(\u03c6(x)) \u2282 supp(\u03c60 (x))\n\u2032\n\nfor a.e. x \u2208 Y .\n\n\f22\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\n(ii) if T is a subgroupoid of (G)Y with S \u22b3 T , then \u03c60 is invariant also for T .\n(iii) S is amenable as a groupoid.\nUsing Lemma 2.11 and Proposition 3.16 (ii), (iii), we can show the following as\nin Corollary 3.9. Note that the set consisting of all points in \u22022 \u03930 fixed by some\ninfinite subgroup of \u03930 is countable (see [17, Chapitre 8] or the comment about the\ndynamics of a hyperbolic group on its boundary right after [25, Theorem 3.3]).\nCorollary 3.17. Under the assumption (\u22c6)h , suppose that \u0393 is non-amenable and\nthat the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measure-preserving. Then the isotropy group\nGxx = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : r(\u03b3) = s(\u03b3) = x}\nis either finite or non-amenable for a.e. x \u2208 X.\nLemma 3.18. Let G1 , G2 be two infinite cyclic groups and suppose that we have\na measure-preserving action of the free product G = G1 \u2217 G2 on a standard finite\nmeasure space (X, \u03bc). Let G, G1 and G2 be the groupoids arising from the actions of\nG, G1 and G2 , respectively. Then the subgroupoid (G1 )A \u2228 (G2 )A of (G)A generated\nby (G1 )A and (G2 )A is non-amenable for any Borel subset A \u2282 X with positive\nmeasure.\nProof. Suppose that (G1 )A \u2228(G2 )A is amenable. We have the natural cocycle \u03c1 : G \u2192\nG. It follows that we can find a \u03c1-invariant Borel map \u03c60 : A \u2192 \u22022 G for (G1 )A \u2228\n(G2 )A as in Proposition 3.16 (i). Let a\u00b1\ni \u2208 \u2202G be the two fixed points on the\nboundary \u2202G of G for the action of the group Gi for i = 1, 2. Then the constant\nmap \u03c6i : A \u2192 \u22022 G with value {a\u00b1\ni } is \u03c1-invariant for the subgroupoid (Gi )A of\ninfinite type. It follows that \u03c6i has to satisfy the property in Proposition 3.16\n(i). Thus, we have supp(\u03c6(x)) \u2282 supp(\u03c6i (x)) = {a\u00b1\ni } for i = 1, 2, which is a\n\u00b1\ncontradiction because {a\u00b1\n}\n\u2229\n{a\n}\n=\n\u2205.\n\u0003\n1\n2\n4. Characterizations of reducible subgroupoids\nThe next two propositions characterize an amenable and a non-amenable reducible subgroupoid, respectively, in terms of amenability, non-amenability and\nnormality. As in the previous section, we use the following notation under the\nassumption (\u22c6):\n\u2022 For a subgroup \u0393\u2032 of \u0393, let G\u0393\u2032 denote the subgroupoid of G generated by\nthe action of \u0393\u2032 .\n\u2022 For \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ), we denote by D\u03c3 the intersection of \u0393 and the subgroup\ngenerated by Dehn twists about all curves in \u03c3. We write G\u03c3 instead of\nGD\u03c3 for simplicity. If \u03c3 consists of one element \u03b1 \u2208 V (C), then we write\nD\u03b1 (resp. G\u03b1 ) instead of D\u03c3 (resp. G\u03c3 ).\n\u2022 For \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ), we write\n\u0393\u03c3 = {g \u2208 \u0393 : g\u03c3 = \u03c3}.\nProposition 4.1. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a Borel subset with\npositive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type. Suppose that\nS is amenable. Consider the following two assertions:\n(i) S is reducible.\n(ii) For any Borel subset A of Y with positive measure, we have a Borel subset\nB of A with positive measure and the following three subgroupoids S \u2032 , S \u2032\u2032\nand T of (G)B :\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n23\n\n(a) an amenable subgroupoid S \u2032 with (S)B < S \u2032 ;\n(b) a subgroupoid S \u2032\u2032 of infinite type with S \u2032\u2032 < S \u2032 ;\n(c) a non-amenable subgroupoid T with S \u2032\u2032 \u22b3 T .\nThen the assertion (ii) implies the assertion (i). If \u0393 is a subgroup of finite index in\n\u0393(M ; m) and the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measure-preserving, then the converse also\nholds.\nProof. First, we show that the assertion (ii) implies the assertion (i). If S were\nnot reducible, then since S is of infinite type and amenable, there would exist an\ninvariant Borel subset A of Y for S with positive measure such that (S)A is IA (see\nTheorem 3.2). It follows from the assumption (ii) that we have a Borel subset B of\nA with positive measure and subgroupoids S \u2032 , S \u2032\u2032 and T satisfying the conditions\nin (ii). Since (S)A is IA and S \u2032 is amenable, it follows from Theorem 3.2 that S \u2032 is\nIA. Moreover, S \u2032\u2032 is also IA. Thus, T is also IA and amenable by Theorem 3.4 (ii)\nand Proposition 3.3, which is a contradiction.\nNext, we assume that \u0393 is a subgroup of finite index in \u0393(M ; m) and show that\nthe assertion (i) implies the assertion (ii). Let A be a Borel subset of Y with positive\nmeasure. Then there exists a Borel subset B of A with positive measure satisfying\nthe following conditions (see Lemma 3.12 for the second condition):\n\u2022 all of the CRS, T and IA systems for S are constant on B. Let \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ),\n\u03c6t , \u03c6ia \u2208 F0 (M ) be their values on B, respectively. Note that the IN system\nfor S is empty since S is amenable;\n\u2022 for a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (S)B and any component Q in \u03c6t and \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(Q)), we have\n\u03c1Q (\u03b3)\u03b1 = \u03b1, where \u03c1Q : (S)B \u2192 \u0393(Q) is the composition of \u03c1 and the\nnatural projection \u0393\u03c3 \u2192 \u0393(Q).\nFor each Q \u2208 \u03c6ia , we have the canonical invariant Borel map \u03c8Q : B \u2192 \u22022 C(Q)\nfor (S)B as in Theorem 3.13 (ii) (b). Let S \u2032 be a subgroupoid of (G)B consisting\nof all \u03b3 \u2208 (G)B satisfying\n\u03c1(\u03b3)\u03c3 = \u03c3, \u03c1Q (\u03b3)\u03c8Q (s(\u03b3)) = \u03c8Q (r(\u03b3)), \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03b1 = \u03b1\nfor any Q \u2208 \u03c6ia , any \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(R)) and any R \u2208 \u03c6t which is not a pair of pants.\nNote that (S)B < S \u2032 . It follows from Proposition 3.15 that S \u2032 is amenable.\nIf |\u03c3| < \u03ba(M ) + 1, then let S \u2032\u2032 = (G\u03c3 )B . Then S \u2032\u2032 < S \u2032 . Since \u0393 is a subgroup\nof finite index in \u0393(M ; m) and there exists a component of M\u03c3 which is not a pair\nof pants, we see that S \u2032\u2032 is of infinite type and \u0393\u03c3 is non-amenable. Thus, the\nsubgroupoid T = (G\u0393\u03c3 )B is non-amenable. Moreover, S \u2032\u2032 \u22b3 T since D\u03c3 is a normal\nsubgroup of \u0393\u03c3 by Lemma 2.2. This completes the construction of subgroupoids in\nthe assertion (ii) in the case of |\u03c3| < \u03ba(M ) + 1.\nIf |\u03c3| = \u03ba(M ) + 1, then S \u2032 = (G\u03c3 )B and it is amenable. Choose \u03b10 \u2208 \u03c3. Let\n\u2032\n\u03c3 = \u03c3 \\ {\u03b10 }, which is an element in S(M ) since \u03ba(M ) > 0. Then S \u2032\u2032 = (G\u03c3\u2032 )B\nis a subgroupoid of infinite type with S \u2032\u2032 < S \u2032 . Define T = (G\u0393\u03c3\u2032 )B . Then T is\nnon-amenable and S \u2032\u2032 \u22b3 T since D\u03c3\u2032 is a normal subgroup of \u0393\u03c3\u2032 by Lemma 2.2.\nThis completes the construction of subgroupoids in the assertion (ii) in the case of\n|\u03c3| = \u03ba(M ) + 1.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.2. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y \u2282 X be a Borel subset with\npositive measure and let S be a subgroupoid of (G)Y of infinite type. Suppose that\n(S)Y \u2032 is not amenable for any Borel subset Y \u2032 of Y with positive measure. Consider\nthe following two assertions:\n\n\f24\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\n(i) S is reducible.\n(ii) For any Borel subset A of Y with positive measure, we have a Borel subset\nB of A with positive measure and the following two subgroupoids S \u2032 and S \u2032\u2032\nof (G)B :\n(a) a subgroupoid S \u2032 with (S)B < S \u2032 ;\n(b) an amenable subgroupoid S \u2032\u2032 of infinite type with S \u2032\u2032 \u22b3 S \u2032 .\nThen the assertion (ii) implies the assertion (i). If \u0393 is a subgroup of finite index in\n\u0393(M ; m) and the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measure-preserving, then the converse also\nholds.\nProof. First, we show that the assertion (ii) implies the assertion (i). Suppose that\nS is not reducible. Then there exists a Borel subset A of Y with positive measure\nsuch that for any Borel subset B of A with positive measure, there is no invariant\nBorel map B \u2192 M (PMF) for S (see Remark 3.3). By the assumption (ii), we\nhave a Borel subset B of A with positive measure and two subgroupoids S \u2032 and S \u2032\u2032\nsatisfying the conditions in (ii). Since S \u2032\u2032 is amenable, by Theorem 3.2, we have a\nBorel partition B = B1 \u2294 B2 (up to null sets) such that (S \u2032\u2032 )B1 is IA and (S \u2032\u2032 )B2 is\nreducible. It follows from Theorem 3.4 (ii) and Theorem 3.5 (iii) that (S \u2032 )B1 is IA\nand (S \u2032 )B2 is reducible. If B1 has positive measure, then (S)B1 is non-amenable by\nthe assumption of S. Since (S)B < S \u2032 , the relation (S \u2032 )B1 is non-amenable, which\ncontradicts to Theorem 3.4 (iii). On the other hand, if B2 has positive measure,\nthen (S)B2 has an invariant Borel map B2 \u2192 S(M ) \u2282 M (PMF), which is also a\ncontradiction.\nNext, we assume that \u0393 is a subgroup of finite index in \u0393(M ; m) and show that\nthe converse also holds. Let A be a Borel subset of Y with positive measure. Then\nthere exists a Borel subset B of A with positive measure such that the CRS for S\nis constant on B. We denote by \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) its value on B. Define a subgroupoid\nS \u2032 = {\u03b3 \u2208 (G)B : \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03c3 = \u03c3} = (G\u0393\u03c3 )B ,\nwhich satisfies (S)B < S \u2032 . Let S \u2032\u2032 = (G\u03c3 )B . Then S \u2032\u2032 is of infinite type since \u0393\nis a subgroup of finite index in \u0393(M ; m) and the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measurepreserving. Since D\u03c3 is a normal subgroup of \u0393\u03c3 and it is amenable by Lemma 2.2,\nwe see that S \u2032\u2032 \u22b3 S \u2032 and S \u2032\u2032 is amenable.\n\u0003\nAssumption 4.1. We call the following assumption (\u2022): for i = 1, 2, let \u0393i be\na finite index subgroup of \u0393(Mi ; mi ), where Mi is a surface with \u03ba(Mi ) > 0 and\nmi \u2265 3 is an integer. Consider a measure-preserving action of \u0393i on a standard\nfinite measure space (Xi , \u03bci ) and let\nG i = G\u0393i , \u03c1i : G i \u2192 \u0393i\nbe the induced groupoid, cocycle, respectively. Suppose that we have a groupoid\nisomorphism\nf : (G 1 )Y1 \u2192 (G 2 )Y2 ,\nwhere Yi \u2282 Xi is a Borel subset satisfying G i Yi = Xi up to null sets.\nThe following corollary is a consequence of Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 which characterize reducible subrelations:\nCorollary 4.3. Under the assumption (\u2022), let A1 be a Borel subset of Y1 with\npositive measure and let S 1 be a subgroupoid of (G 1 )A1 of infinite type. Then S 1 is\nreducible if and only if the image f (S 1 ) is reducible.\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n25\n\nNext, we characterize maximal reducible subgroupoids. In the assumption (\u22c6),\nlet Y be a Borel subset of X with positive measure and let \u03c6 : Y \u2192 S(M ) be a\nBorel map. Then we define a reducible subgroupoid\nS\u03c6 = {\u03b3 \u2208 (G)Y : \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03c6(s(\u03b3)) = \u03c6(r(\u03b3))}.\nProposition 4.4. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y be a Borel subset of X with\npositive measure and let \u03c6 : Y \u2192 S(M ) be a Borel map. Assume that \u0393 is a subgroup\nof finite index in \u0393(M ; m) and that the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measure-preserving.\nThen the CRS for S\u03c6 is \u03c6 and for a.e. x \u2208 Y , each component of M\u03c6(x) either is\na pair of pants or is IN for S\u03c6 .\nProof. We may assume that all of the CRS, T, IA and IN systems for S\u03c6 and \u03c6 are\nconstant by [25, Lemmas 5.7, 5.10]. We denote the value of \u03c6 by the same symbol.\nNote that S\u03c6 is equal to (G\u0393\u03c6 )Y . It follows from Lemmas 2.3, 3.6 that the CRS for\nS\u03c6 is \u03c6.\nLet Q be a component of M\u03c6 which is not a pair of pants. Let g1 , g2 \u2208 \u0393\u03c6\nbe elements such that {pQ (g1 ), pQ (g2 )} is an independent pair of pseudo-Anosov\nelements in \u0393(Q), where pQ : \u0393\u03c6 \u2192 \u0393(Q) is the natural homomorphism. Let G be\nthe subgroup of \u0393\u03c6 generated by g1 and g2 . Note that (GG )Y < S\u03c6 .\nIf Q were T for S\u03c6 , then it follows from Lemma 3.12 that there would exist a Borel\nsubset A of Y with positive measure such that \u03c1Q (\u03b3)\u03b1 = \u03b1 for any \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(Q))\nand for a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (S\u03c6 )A , where \u03c1Q is the composition of \u03c1 and pQ . This contradicts\nthe fact that pQ (g1n )\u03b1 6= \u03b1 for any \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(Q)) and all n \u2208 Z \\ {0}.\nIf Q were IA for S\u03c6 , then we would have the canonical invariant Borel map\n\u03c6 : Y \u2192 \u22022 C(Q) for S\u03c6 as in Theorem 3.13 (ii) (b). For i = 1, 2, define a Borel map\n\u03c6i : Y \u2192 \u22022 C(Q) to be the constant map whose value is the image of {F\u00b1 (pQ (gi ))}\nin \u2202C(Q). Recall that the natural map MIN \u2192 \u2202C is injective on the set of all\npseudo-Anosov foliations. It follows that \u03c6i is the canonical invariant Borel map\nfor (GGi )Y for i = 1, 2, where Gi is the cyclic subgroup generated by gi . Since \u03c6 is\ninvariant for (GGi )Y , we have the inclusion\nsupp(\u03c6(x)) \u2282 supp(\u03c6i (x))\nfor a.e. x \u2208 Y and any i = 1, 2. This is a contradiction because {F\u00b1 (pQ (g1 ))} \u2229\n{F\u00b1 (pQ (g2 ))} = \u2205.\n\u0003\nIn what follows, we regard V (C) as a subset of S(M ) naturally.\nCorollary 4.5. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y be a Borel subset of X with positive\nmeasure and let \u03c6 : Y \u2192 V (C) be a Borel map. Assume that \u0393 is a finite index\nsubgroup of \u0393(M ; m) and that the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measure-preserving. If S\nis a reducible subgroupoid of (G)Y with S\u03c6 < S, then S = S\u03c6 .\nProof. Let \u03c8 : Y \u2192 S(M ) be the CRS for S. It is enough to show \u03c6 = \u03c8 up to null\nsets. Choose \u03b1 \u2208 V (C) and \u03c3 \u2208 S(M ) such that \u03bc(\u03c6\u22121 (\u03b1) \u2229 \u03c8 \u22121 (\u03c3)) > 0 and put\nA = \u03c6\u22121 (\u03b1) \u2229 \u03c8 \u22121 (\u03c3). It suffices to prove \u03c6 = \u03c8 a.e. on A, that is, \u03c3 = {\u03b1}. We\nmay assume that all the T, IA and IN systems for S\u03c6 on A are constant.\nChoose \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c3. Since \u03b2 is in the CRS for (S)A , the pair (\u03b2, A) is \u03c1-invariant for S\u03c6 .\nIf we had a component Q of M\u03b1 which is not a pair of pants and satisfies r(\u03b2, Q) 6= \u2205,\nthen Q would be T for S\u03c6 by Theorem 3.11, which contradicts Proposition 4.4.\nThus, r(\u03b2, Q) = \u2205 for each component Q of M\u03b1 which is not a pair of pants.

Under the assumption (\u2022), let A1 be a Borel subset of Y1 with\npositive measure and let \u03c61 : A1 \u2192 V (C(M1 )) be a Borel map.

An equivariant Borel map from a self ME coupling\nIn the next lemma, we study a normal amenable subgroupoid of a maximal\nreducible subgroupoid. As in the previous section, we regard the vertex set V (C)\nas a subset of the simplex set S(M ) naturally.\nLemma 5.1. Under the assumption (\u22c6), let Y be a Borel subset of X with positive\nmeasure and let \u03c6 : Y \u2192 V (C) be a Borel map. Assume that \u0393 is a finite index\nsubgroup of \u0393(M ; m) and that the \u0393-action on (X, \u03bc) is measure-preserving. If S\nis an amenable subgroupoid of F\nS\u03c6 of infinite type with S \u22b3 S\u03c6 , then there exists a\ncountable Borel partition Y = Yn of Y satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) the map \u03c6 is constant a.e. on Yn . Let \u03b1n \u2208 V (C) be its value;\n(ii) for each n, we have (S)Yn < (G\u03b1n )Yn < (S\u03c6 )Yn .\nProof. Recall that S\u03c6 is reducible and its CRS is given by \u03c6 (see Proposition 4.4).\nSince S is a subgroupoid of S\u03c6 , it is also reducible. Let \u03c8 : Y \u2192 S(M ) be the CRS\nfor S. Since S is normal in S\u03c6 , the map \u03c8 is invariant also for S\u03c6 by Theorem 3.5\n(iii). By the definition of essential \u03c1-invariant pairs, we see that \u03c8(x) \u2282 \u03c6(x) for\na.e. x \u2208 Y . It follows that \u03c8(x) = \u03c6(x) for a.e. x \u2208 Y .\nLet A be a Borel subset of Y with positive measure such that all of the CRS\n\u03c6 = \u03c8 and T, IA and IN systems for S and S\u03c6 are constant on A. We denote\nby \u03b1 \u2208 V (C) the value of \u03c6 = \u03c8 on A. If Q is a component of M\u03b1 , then Q is\nnot IN for (S)A since S is amenable. If Q were IA for (S)A , then Q would be IA\nalso for (S\u03c6 )A by Lemma 3.14 (iii), which contradicts Proposition 4.4. Thus, each\ncomponent of M\u03b1 is T for (S)A .\nF\nIt follows from Lemma 3.12 that we have a countable Borel partition A = An\nof A such that \u03c1(\u03b3)\u03b2 = \u03b2 for each component Q of M\u03b1 and \u03b2 \u2208 V (C(Q)) and for\na.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (S)An for any n. For a.e. \u03b3 \u2208 (S)An , consider the subgroup of \u0393 generated\nby \u03c1(\u03b3). If \u03c1(\u03b3) is non-trivial, then the CRS for the subgroup is {\u03b1} by Lemma 2.4.\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n27\n\nIt follows from [21, Corollary 7.18] (see the comment right before Lemma\n2.3) that\nQ\n\u03c1(\u03b3) lies in the kernel of the natural homomorphism from \u0393\u03b1 into Q \u0393(Q), where\nQ is taken over all components of M\u03b1 . Thus, \u03c1(\u03b3) \u2208 D\u03b1 by Lemma 2.2. Since A is\nany Borel subset of Y with positive measure such that all of \u03c6 = \u03c8 and T, IA and\nIN systems for S and S\u03c6 are constant on A, we complete the proof.\n\u0003\nUnder the assumption (\u2022), let \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(M1 )). Define the constant map \u03c6\u03b1 : Y1 \u220b\nx 7\u2192 \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(M1 )). It follows from Corollary 4.7 that we have a Borel map\n\u03c62 : Y2 \u2192 V (C(M2 )) such that f (S\u03c61 \u03b1 ) = S\u03c62 2 , where we use the same notation as\nin the corollary. Since the intersection of \u03931 and the subgroup of \u0393(M1 ) generated\nby a Dehn twist along \u03b1 is normal in\n\u03931,\u03b1 = {g \u2208 \u03931 : g\u03b1 = \u03b1}\n= (G\u03931 1,\u03b1 )Y1 , we see that (G\u03b11 )Y1 \u22b3 S\u03c61 \u03b1 . Thus, f ((G\u03b11 )Y1 ) \u22b3\nby Lemma 2.2 and\nF\nS\u03c62 2 . By Lemma 5.1, we have a countable Borel partition Y2 = An such that\n(i) the map \u03c62 is constant on An for each n. Let us denote the value by\n\u03b2n \u2208 V (C(M2 ));\n(ii) for each n, we have (f ((G\u03b11 )Y1 ))An < (G\u03b22n )An < (S\u03c62 2 )An .\nTherefore, for each \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(M1 )), we can define a Borel map\nS\u03c61 \u03b1\n\n\u03a8(*, \u03b1) : Y1 \u2192 V (C(M2 ))\n\u22121\n\nby \u03a8(x, \u03b1) = \u03b2n if x \u2208 f (An ) (up\nF to null sets). Note that this map does not\ndepend on the decomposition Y2 = An .\n\nLemma 5.2. If \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 V (C(M1 )) satisfy i(\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 ) = 0, then i(\u03a8(x, \u03b1), \u03a8(x, \u03b1\u2032 )) = 0\nfor a.e. x \u2208 Y1 .\nProof. Since i(\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 ) = 0, we see that\n(G\u03b11 )A \u22b3 (G\u03b11 )A \u2228 (G\u03b11 \u2032 )A\nfor any Borel subset A of Y1 with positive measure (see Lemma 2.14). It follows\nfrom F\nthe construction of \u03a8(*, \u03b1), \u03a8(*, \u03b1\u2032 ) that we have a countable Borel partition\nY2 = An and \u03b2n , \u03b2n\u2032 \u2208 V (C(M2 )) such that\n(f ((G\u03b11 )Y1 ))An < (G\u03b22n )An ,\n\n(f ((G\u03b11 \u2032 )Y1 ))An < (G\u03b22n\u2032 )An\n\nfor each n. Using Lemma 3.7, we see that (f ((G\u03b11 )Y1 ))An (resp. (f ((G\u03b11 \u2032 )Y1 ))An )\nis a reducible subrelation of (G 2 )An and its CRS is given by the constant map\nAn \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03b2n (resp. \u03b2n\u2032 ) \u2208 V (C(M2 )). It follows from the above normality that\nthe constant map An \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03b2n is invariant also for (f ((G\u03b11 \u2032 )Y1 ))An , which implies\ni(\u03b2n , \u03b2n\u2032 ) = 0 by the pureness of the pair (\u03b2n\u2032 , An ) for (f ((G\u03b11 \u2032 )Y1 ))An .\n\u0003\nLemma 5.3. Let M be a surface with \u03ba(M ) \u2265 0 and let \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 V (C(M )) with\ni(\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 ) 6= 0. Then tn\u03b1 and tm\n\u03b1\u2032 generate a free group of rank 2 for all sufficiently large\nn, m \u2208 N, where t\u03b1 , t\u03b1\u2032 \u2208 \u0393(M ) denote the Dehn twists about \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 , respectively.\nProof. We regard \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 as elements in PMF. Choose an open neighborhood\nU of \u03b1 such that\nU \u2282 {F \u2208 PMF : i(F, \u03b1\u2032 ) 6= 0},\nwhere K denotes the closure of a subset K of PMF.

Let w be a\nnon-empty reduced word consisting of a\u00b11 , b\u00b11 . We prove that w is non-trivial in\n\u0393(M ). It follows from the above inclusion that both ak and bl are non-trivial for\nany k, l \u2208 Z \\ {0}. Therefore, by possibly replacing w by an appropriate conjugate\nand an inverse, it is enough to prove that w = ak w\u2032 bl is non-trivial in \u0393(M ), where\nk, l \u2208 Z \\ {0} and w\u2032 is a reduced word such that if w\u2032 is non-empty, then the first\nletter of w\u2032 is b or b\u22121 and the last letter of w\u2032 is a or a\u22121 .

On the other\nhand, (G\u03b11 )A \u2228 (G\u03b11 \u2032 )A is non-amenable by Lemma 5.3 and Lemma 3.18, which is a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nFor each \u03b1 \u2208 V (C(M1 )), we have a Borel subset A\u03b1 of Y1 with full measure such\nthat \u03a8(*, \u03b1) is defined on A\u03b1 .

In this proof, we use the notation as in (\u2022). For the existence of\n\u03a6, it is enough to show that there exists a Borel map \u03a6 : \u03a9 \u2192 Aut(C) such that\n\u03a6(g1 g2 \u03c9) = \u03c0(g2 )\u03a6(\u03c9)\u03c0(g1 )\u22121\nfor any g1 \u2208 \u03931 , g2 \u2208 \u03932 and a.e. \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9.

We identify \u03a9 with X1 \u00d7 \u03932 . For the proof of the theorem, it is enough to\nshow that if we define \u03a6 : \u03a9 \u2192 Aut(C) by the formula\n\u03a6(g1 g2 (x, e)) = \u03c0(g2 )\u03a8(x)\u03c0(g1 )\u22121\nfor g1 \u2208 \u03931 , g2 \u2208 \u03932 and x \u2208 Y1 , then it is well-defined. In other words, it is enough\nto show that\n\u03c0(g2 )\u03a8(x)\u03c0(g1 )\u22121 = \u03c0(g2\u2032 )\u03a8(x\u2032 )\u03c0(g1\u2032 )\u22121\nfor any g1 , g1\u2032 \u2208 \u03931 , g2 , g2\u2032 \u2208 \u03932 and a.e. x, x\u2032 \u2208 Y1 satisfying\ng1 g2 (x, e) = g1\u2032 g2\u2032 (x\u2032 , e).\nIn what follows, we omit \u03c0 for simplicity. Since\n(x\u2032 , e) = (g1\u2032 )\u22121 g1 (g2\u2032 )\u22121 g2 (x, e) = ((g1\u2032 )\u22121 g1 x, \u03b1((g1\u2032 )\u22121 g1 , x)g2\u22121 g2\u2032 ),\nwe see that x\u2032 = (g1\u2032 )\u22121 g1 x \u2208 Y1 . Since \u03b1(g, y) = \u03c12 (f (g, y)) for g \u2208 \u03931 , y \u2208 Y1\nwith gy \u2208 Y1 , we have\n\u03a8(x\u2032 ) = \u03a8((g1\u2032 )\u22121 g1 x) = \u03c12 (f ((g1\u2032 )\u22121 g1 , x))\u03a8(x)\u03c11 ((g1\u2032 )\u22121 g1 , x)\u22121\n= (g2\u2032 )\u22121 g2 \u03a8(x)g1\u22121 g1\u2032\nby Lemma 5.5, which shows the claim.\nThe uniqueness of \u03a6 is a consequence of Theorem 2.6 and the following Lemma\n5.7.\n\u0003\nDefinition 5.2. Let \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 G be a homomorphism between discrete groups.\nThen \u03c0 is said to be ICC (infinite conjugacy class) if the set {\u03c0(\u03b3)g\u03c0(\u03b3)\u22121 : \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393}\nconsists of infinitely many elements for any g \u2208 G \\ {e}.\nLemma 5.7. Let \u0393, \u039b and G be discrete groups and assume that\n\u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 G, \u03c4 : \u039b \u2192 G\nare homomorphisms and that either \u03c0 or \u03c4 is ICC.

We may assume that \u03c0 is ICC. Let us define a Borel map \u03a60 : \u03a3 \u2192 G by\n\u03a60 (x) = \u03a6\u2032 (x)\u03a6(x)\u22121 for x \u2208 \u03a3. Then \u03a60 satisfies the equality\n\u03a60 (\u03b3\u03bbx) = \u03c0(\u03b3)\u03a60 (x)\u03c0(\u03b3)\u22121\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and a.e. x \u2208 \u03a3. Therefore, \u03a60 is \u039b-invariant and induces an\nalmost \u0393-equivariant Borel map \u039b\\\u03a3 \u2192 G, where the \u0393-action on G is given by\nconjugation via \u03c0. By projecting the finite \u0393-invariant measure on \u039b\\\u03a3 to G, we\nobtain a finite measure on G which is invariant under the conjugation via \u03c0 of each\nelement of \u0393. Since \u03c0 is ICC, the support of this measure is equal to {e}, which\nmeans that \u03a60 = e a.e. on \u03a3.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.8. Let \u0393, \u039b and G be discrete groups and assume that\n\u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 G, \u03c4 : \u039b \u2192 G\nare homomorphisms.

We may assume that the restriction \u03c4 : \u039b\u2032 \u2192 G is ICC. For fixed \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b, define a Borel map \u03a60 : \u03a3 \u2192 G by the formula\n\u03a60 (x) = \u03a6(\u03b3\u03bbx)\u22121 \u03c0(\u03b3)\u03a6(x)\u03c4 (\u03bb)\u22121\nfor x \u2208 \u03a3.\nLet g \u2208 \u0393\u2032 , h \u2208 \u039b\u2032 . Since \u0393\u2032 is normal in \u0393 and \u039b\u2032 is normal in \u039b, we have g \u2032 \u2208 \u0393\u2032\nand h\u2032 \u2208 \u039b\u2032 such that \u03b3g = g \u2032 \u03b3 and \u03bbh\u2032 = h\u03bb.

The\nprojectivized finite measure on G is invariant under the conjugation via \u03c4 of each\nelement of \u039b\u2032 . As in the proof of Lemma 5.7, we can show that \u03a60 = e a.e. on\n\u03a3.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.9. Let M be a surface with \u03ba(M ) > 0 and let \u0393, \u039b be finite index\nsubgroups of \u0393(M )\u22c4 or Aut(C), respectively. Suppose that we have a ME coupling\n(\u03a9, m) of \u0393 and \u039b.

Measure equivalence rigidity\nGiven a ME coupling (\u03a3, m) of discrete groups \u0393 and \u039b, we can define the\nopposite coupling \u03a3\u030c of \u039b and \u0393 as the \u039b \u00d7 \u0393-space obtained by the canonical\nisomorphism between \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b and \u039b \u00d7 \u0393. When \u0393 = \u039b, we distinguish the \u0393-actions\non \u03a3 by writing (\u03b3, x) 7\u2192 A1\u03b3 x and A2\u03b3 x, respectively, for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and x \u2208 \u03a3.\n\n\f32\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nIf (\u03a3, m) is a ME coupling of discrete groups \u0393 and \u039b and (\u03a9, n) is a ME coupling\nof discrete groups \u039b and \u2206, then we can define the composed coupling \u03a3 \u00d7\u039b \u03a9 of\n\u0393 and \u2206 as the quotient space of \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a9 by the diagonal \u039b-action.\nDefinition 6.1. Let \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 G be a homomorphism between discrete groups. We\nsay that \u03c0 is almost an isomorphism if both ker(\u03c0) and coker(\u03c0) are finite.\nTheorem 6.1. Let \u0393, \u039b, G be discrete groups and let \u03c0, \u03c4 : \u0393 \u2192 G be homomorphisms. Suppose that \u03c0 is ICC and \u03c4 is almost an isomorphism and we have a\nME coupling (\u03a3, m) of \u0393 and \u039b and let \u03a9 = \u03a3 \u00d7\u039b \u039b \u00d7\u039b \u03a3\u030c be the self ME coupling\nof \u0393. Moreover, assume that there exists an almost \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393-equivariant Borel map\n\u03a6 : \u03a9 \u2192 (G, \u03c0, \u03c4 ). Then we can find the following two maps:\n(a) a homomorphism \u03c1 : \u039b \u2192 G which is almost an isomorphism;\n(b) an almost \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b-equivariant Borel map \u03a60 : \u03a3 \u2192 (G, \u03c4, \u03c1).\nBefore the proof, we give the following lemma:\nLemma 6.2. Let \u0393, \u039b, G be discrete groups and let (\u03a3, m) be a ME coupling\nof \u0393 and \u039b. Let Y \u2282 \u03a3 be a fundamental domain of the \u0393-action on \u03a3 and let\n\u03b8 : \u039b \u00d7 Y \u2192 \u0393 be the associated cocycle. Suppose the following two conditions:\n(i) we have a homomorphism \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 G which is almost an isomorphism;\n(ii) there exists a subgroup G0 of G such that the cocycle \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b8 : \u039b \u00d7 Y \u2192 G is\ncohomologous to a cocycle which is essentially valued in G0 .\nThen G0 is a subgroup of finite index in G.\nProof. Take a standard \u039b-action on a standard probability space X0 . Define a\n\u0393-action and a G \u00d7 \u039b-action on \u03a3 \u00d7 G \u00d7 X0 by\n\u03b3(z, g, x) = (\u03b3z, \u03c0(\u03b3)g, x)\n(g1 , \u03bb)(z, g, x) = (\u03bbz, gg1\u22121 , \u03bbx)\nfor g, g1 \u2208 G, \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, z \u2208 \u03a3 and x \u2208 X0 . Consider the quotient G\u00d7\u039b-space \u03a3\u0303\nof \u03a3\u00d7G\u00d7X0 by the \u0393-action. Since ker(\u03c0) is finite, the \u039b-action has a fundamental\ndomain. Since coker(\u03c0) is finite, the \u039b-action has a fundamental domain of finite\nmeasure. Thus, the G \u00d7 \u039b-space \u03a3\u0303 is a ME coupling of G and \u039b.\nLet p : \u03a3 \u00d7 G \u00d7 X0 \u2192 \u03a3\u0303 be the natural projection. Then p(Y \u00d7 {e} \u00d7 X0 )\nis a fundamental domain of the G-action on \u03a3\u0303. Remark that p is injective on\nY \u00d7 {e} \u00d7 X0. The cocycle \u03b8\u0303 : \u039b \u00d7 p(Y \u00d7 {e} \u00d7 X0) \u2192 G associated to it is given by\n\u03b8\u0303(\u03bb, p(y, e, x)) = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b8(\u03bb, y)\nfor \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, y \u2208 Y and x \u2208 X0 . By assumption, we can find a Borel map \u03c6 : Y \u2192 G\nsuch that\n\u03b8\u2032 (\u03bb, y) = \u03c6(\u03bb * y)\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b8(\u03bb, y)\u03c6(y)\u22121 \u2208 G0\nfor any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and a.e. y \u2208 Y .

It follows from [31,\nLemma 6.2] that for m-a.e. x \u2208 \u03a3, the Borel map \u03c1x : \u039b \u2192 \u0393 given by\n\u03c1x (\u03bb) = F (\u03bb\u22121 x, y)F (x, y)\u22121\nis the same for m-a.e. y \u2208 \u03a3 and defines a homomorphism. Moreover, the equality\n\u03c1y (\u03bb) = F (x, y)\u22121 \u03c1x (\u03bb)F (x, y)\nholds for any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and m2 -a.e. (x, y) \u2208 \u03a32 .

Put\n\u03b8\u2032 (\u03bb, t) = \u03c6(\u03bb * t)\u03c4 \u25e6 \u03b8(\u03bb, t)\u03c6(t)\u22121\nfor \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and t \u2208 E. Since \u03bb * t = \u03bb\u03b8(\u03bb, t)t, we see that\n\u03a6\u0303(\u03bb * t) = \u03a6\u0303(\u03bb\u03b8(\u03bb, t)t) = \u03a6\u0303(\u03bbt)\u03c4 \u25e6 \u03b8(\u03bb, t)\u22121\nand\n\u03b8\u2032 (\u03bb, t) = F (x0 , x)\u03a6\u0303(\u03bb * t)\u03c4 \u25e6 \u03b8(\u03bb, t)\u03a6\u0303(t)\u22121 F (x0 , x)\u22121\n= F (x0 , x)\u03a6\u0303(\u03bbt)\u03a6\u0303(t)\u22121 F (x0 , x)\u22121\n= F (x0 , x)\u03c1x (\u03bb)F (x0 , x)\u22121 = \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2208 \u03c1(\u039b).\nIt follows from Lemma 6.2 that \u03c1(\u039b) is a subgroup of finite index in G.\nFinally, we construct a Borel map \u03a60 : \u03a3 \u2192 G. Note that {x0 } \u00d7 \u039b \u00d7 D \u2282 \u03a9\u0303 is a\n\u0393 \u00d7 \u039b-invariant Borel subset isomorphic to \u03a3 as \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b-spaces. It follows from the\nchoice of x0 that the composition of the restriction of \u03a6\u0303 to {x0 } \u00d7 \u039b \u00d7 D and the\nmap G \u220b g 7\u2192 g \u22121 \u2208 G is a desired map.\n\u0003\nCombining Corollary 5.9 and Theorem 6.1, we obtain Theorem 1.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. First, suppose that \u03ba(M 1 ) \u2265 \u03ba(M 2 ). We may assume that\n\u03ba(M 1 ) \u2265 2. By Theorem 1.1, we can find an injective homomorphism \u0393(M 1 ; 3) \u2192\nAut(C(M 2 )) with finite cokernel. By using Theorem 2.5 and restricting the homomorphism to some subgroup \u03931 of finite index in \u0393(M 1 ; 3), we can construct an\ninjective homomorphism from \u03931 into \u0393(M 2 ) with finite cokernel. It follows from\n[36, Theorem 2] that M 1 = M0,6 and M 2 = M2,0 . Similarly, if we assume that\n\u03ba(M 1 ) \u2264 \u03ba(M 2 ), then it can be shown that M 1 = M0,6 and M 2 = M2,0 .\n\u0003\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n35\n\n7. Rigidity for a direct product of mapping class groups\nWe need to review Monod-Shalom's technique in [31, Section 5.1].\nLet \u03931 , . . . , \u0393n be torsion-free discrete groups in the class C, mentioned in Section\n1, and let \u039b1 , . . . , \u039bn be torsion-free discrete groups. Put \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393n and\n\u039b = \u039b1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u039bn . Let us denote\nY\nY\n\u0393\u2032i =\n\u0393j , \u039b\u2032i =\n\u039bj\nj6=i\n\nj6=i\n\nfor i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Suppose that we have a ME coupling (\u03a3, m) of \u0393 and \u039b.\nIn the above situation, we can find a bijection t : {1, . . . , n} \u2192 {1, . . . , n} and\nfundamental domains Y, X \u2282 \u03a3 of the \u0393-, \u039b-actions on \u03a3, respectively, satisfying\n\u039bt(i) Y \u2282 \u0393i Y, \u0393i X \u2282 \u039bt(i) X\n\nfor any i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Let \u03a3i be the space of ergodic components of the \u0393\u2032i \u00d7 \u039b\u2032t(i) action on (\u03a3, m) for i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, which is naturally a \u0393i \u00d7 \u039bt(i) -space. Define\na measure \u03bci (resp. \u03bdi ) on \u03a3i by projecting the restricted measure on \u0393i Y (resp.\n\u039bt(i) X) through the natural map \u0393i Y \u2192 \u03a3i (resp. \u039bt(i) X \u2192 \u03a3i ). Then\n(a) \u03bci and \u03bdi are absolutely continuous with respect to each other.\n(b) both \u03bci and \u03bdi are invariant for the \u0393i \u00d7 \u039bt(i) -action on \u03a3i .\n(c) if Y (resp. X) is the image of Y (resp. X) in \u03a3i , then it is a fundamental\ndomain of the \u0393i -action on (\u03a3i , \u03bci ) (resp. the \u039bt(i) -action on (\u03a3i , \u03bdi )).\nMoreover, both \u03bci (Y ) and \u03bdi (X) are finite.\nThese claims are shown in the proof of [31, Theorem 1.16], where the ergodicity\nof (\u03a3, m) is assumed. However, we can show the above claims along the same line\nwithout this assumption.\nLet\nd\u03bci\nci (x) =\n(x), x \u2208 \u03a3i\nd\u03bdi\nbe the Radon-Nikodym derivative, which is positive and finite a.e. on \u03a3i . It follows\nfrom the condition (b) that the function ci is invariant for the \u0393i \u00d7 \u039bt(i) -action.\nPut\n\u03a3i,n = {x \u2208 \u03a3i : n < ci (x) \u2264 n + 1}\nF\nfor n \u2208 N. Then \u03a3i = n\u2208N \u03a3i,n up to null sets. It follows from the condition (c)\nthat \u03a3i,n is a ME coupling of \u0393i and \u039bt(i) with respect to \u03bci for each n \u2208 N (if \u03a3i,n\nhas non-zero measure).\nIn this situation, we suppose the following condition: for i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} and\nj \u2208 {1, 2}, let Mij be a surface with \u03ba(Mij ) > 0 and Mij 6= M1,2 , M2,0 . Assume that\n\u0393i (resp. \u039bi ) is a torsion-free subgroup of finite index in \u0393(Mi1 )\u22c4 (resp. \u0393(Mi2 )\u22c4 )\nfor each i.\nRemark that the mapping class group \u0393(M ) is in C for a surface M with \u03ba(M ) \u2265\n0 ([19, Corollary B]) and this property is preserved under measure equivalence and\nin particular, commensurability up to finite kernel ([31, Corollary 7.6]). Note that\n2\nMi1 and Mt(i)\nare diffeomorphic for any i by Theorem 1.2 and let gi be an isotopy\n2\nclass of a diffeomorphism Mt(i)\n\u2192 Mi1 . Let\n\u03c0g :\n\nn\nY\n\ni=1\n\n\u0393(Mi2 )\u22c4 \u2192\n\nn\nY\n\ni=1\n\nAut(C(Mi1 ))\n\n\f36\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nbe the isomorphism defined by\n\u03c0g (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n ) = (\u03c0(g1 \u03b3t(1) g1\u22121 ), . . . , \u03c0(gn \u03b3t(n) gn\u22121 ))\nfor \u03b3i \u2208 \u0393(Mi2 )\u22c4 , where we denote by the same symbol \u03c0 the natural homomorphism\n\u0393(M )\u22c4 \u2192 Aut(C(M )) for a surface M . By applying Corollary 5.9 to each ME\ncoupling \u03a3i,n of \u0393i and \u039bt(i) , we can find an almost \u0393i \u00d7\u039bt(i) -equivariant Borel map\n2\n)\u22c4 \u2192 Aut(C(Mi1 )) is defined by\n\u03a6i : \u03a3i \u2192 (Aut(C(Mi )), \u03c0, \u03c0gi ), where \u03c0gi : \u0393(Mt(i)\nQn\nusing gi . Then we can define a Borel map \u03a6 : \u03a3 \u2192 i=1 Aut(C(Mi1 )) by\n\u03a6(x) = (\u03a61 (p1 (x)), . . . , \u03a6n (pn (x)))\n\nfor x \u2208 \u03a3, where pi : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3i denotes the natural projection. It is easy to see that\n\u03a6((\u03b3, \u03bb)x) = \u03c0(\u03b3)\u03a6(x)\u03c0g (\u03bb)\u22121\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and a.e. x \u2208 \u03a3.\nHence, we have shown the following:\nTheorem 7.1. For i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} and j \u2208 {1, 2}, let Mij be a surface with \u03ba(Mij ) >\n0 and Mij 6= M1,2 , M2,0 .

It is easy to check that if \u03ba(Mi ) > 0 and \u0393i is a finite index subgroup of\n\u0393(Mi )\u22c4 , then the natural homomorphism\n\u03931 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393n \u2192 Aut(C(M1 )) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Aut(C(Mn ))\nis almost an isomorphism and ICC. By Lemma 5.8 and Theorem 7.1, we obtain the\ncorollary.\n\u0003\nCombining Theorem 6.1 and the above corollary, we can obtain Theorem 1.3.\nThe following corollary determines all isomorphisms between finite index subgroups\nof a direct product of mapping class groups (see also [23, Section 8.5]).\nCorollary 7.3. For i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, let Mi be a surface with \u03ba(Mi ) > 0 and Mi 6=\nM1,2 , M2,0 , and let \u0393 be a finite index subgroup of G = \u0393(M1 )\u22c4 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393(Mn )\u22c4 .\nSuppose that we have an injective homomorphism \u03c4 : \u0393 \u2192 G with finite cokernel.\nThen we can find a bijection t on the set {1, . . . , n} and an isotopy class gi of a\ndiffeomorphism Mt(i) \u2192 Mi for each i such that for any \u03b3 = (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n ) \u2208 \u0393, we\nhave\n\u03c4 (\u03b3) = (g1 \u03b3t(1) g1\u22121 , . . . , gn \u03b3t(n) gn\u22121 ).\n\n\fMEASURE EQUIVALENCE RIGIDITY OF THE MAPPING CLASS GROUP\n\n37\n\nProof. We identify \u0393(Mi )\u22c4 and Aut(C(Mi )) via the natural isomorphism. Consider\nthe self ME coupling (G, \u03c0, \u03c4 ) of \u0393. It follows from Corollary 7.2 that we can find\nthe following:\n(a) a bijection t on {1, . . . , n};\n2\n(b) an isotopy class gi of a diffeomorphism Mt(i)\n\u2192 Mi1 for each i;\n(c) an almost \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393-equivariant Borel map\n\u03a6 : (G, \u03c0, \u03c4 ) \u2192 (G, \u03c0, \u03c0g ).\nPut h = (h1 , . . . , hn ) = \u03a6(e) and define an automorphism \u03c0hg of G by\n\u03c0hg (s) = (h1 g1 st(1) g1\u22121 h1\u22121 , . . . , hn gn st(n) gn\u22121 h\u22121\nn )\nfor s = (s1 , . . . , sn ) \u2208 G. Define a G \u00d7 G-equivariant map\n\u03a8 : (G, \u03c0, \u03c0g ) \u2192 (G, \u03c0, \u03c0hg )\n\u22121\n\nby \u03a8(s) = sh for s \u2208 G. Since (G, \u03c0, \u03c4 ) is also a ME coupling of G and \u0393, we see\nthat \u03a6 is G \u00d7 \u0393-equivariant by Lemma 5.8. It is easy to see that \u03a8 \u25e6 \u03a6(e) = e and\nthus, \u03a8 \u25e6 \u03a6 = id. Therefore, \u03c4 is the restriction of \u03c0hg .\n\u0003\n8. Lattice embeddings of the mapping class group\nIn this final section, we give another application of Corollaries 5.9 and 7.2,\nfollowing [13]. We describe all lattice embeddings of a finite direct product of\nmapping class groups into a locally compact second countable (lcsc) group. We\nfix notations as follows: let n be a positive integer and Mi be a surface with\n\u03ba(Mi ) > 0 for i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Put G0 = \u0393(M1 )\u22c4 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393(Mn )\u22c4 and G =\nAut(C(M1 )) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Aut(C(Mn )). Let \u03c0 : G0 \u2192 G be the natural homomorphism.\nTheorem 8.1. Let \u0393 be a finite index subgroup of G0 . Suppose that we have a\nlattice embedding \u03c3 : \u0393 \u2192 H into a lcsc group H. Then there exist the following\ntwo maps:\n(i) an almost \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393-equivariant Borel map \u03a6 : (H, \u03c3, \u03c3) \u2192 (G, \u03c0, \u03c0), which\nsatisfies \u03a6(h1 h2 ) = \u03a6(h1 )\u03a6(h2 ) for a.e.

Moreover, ker(\u03a60 ) is compact.\nProof. First, we show the assertion (i). To prove this, we may assume that Mi 6=\nM1,2 , M2,0 for all i by using Lemma 5.8. We identify \u0393(Mi )\u22c4 and Aut(C(Mi )) via\nthe natural isomorphism. Applying Corollary 7.2 to the self ME coupling H of \u0393\nwith the Haar measure, we can find a bijection t on the set {1, . . . , n}, an isotopy\nclass gi of a diffeomorphism Mt(i) \u2192 Mi and an almost \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393-equivariant Borel\nmap\n\u03a6\u2032 : (H, \u03c3, \u03c3) \u2192 (G, \u03c0, \u03c0g ).\nDefine a Borel map F : H \u00d7 H \u2192 G by\n\u22121 \u2032 \u22121\nF (h1 , h2 ) = \u03a6\u2032 (h\u22121\n\u03a6 (h1 h2 )\u03a6\u2032 (h2 )\u22121\n1 )\n\nfor h1 , h2 \u2208 H. Then for any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and a.e. (h1 , h2 ) \u2208 H \u00d7 H, we have\nF (h1 \u03c3(\u03b3), h2 ) = F (h1 , h2 ) = F (h1 , h2 \u03c3(\u03b3)\u22121 ),\nF (\u03c3(\u03b3)h1 , \u03c3(\u03b3)h2 ) = \u03c0g (\u03b3)F (h1 , h2 )\u03c0(\u03b3)\u22121 .\nThus, F induces a Borel map f from X = (H/\u03c3(\u0393)) \u00d7 (H/\u03c3(\u0393)) to G such that\nf (\u03b3x) = \u03c0g (\u03b3)f (x)\u03c0(\u03b3)\u22121\n\n\f38\n\nYOSHIKATA KIDA\n\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and a.e. x \u2208 X, where the \u0393-action on X is induced from the diagonal\none on H \u00d7 H through \u03c3. By projecting the finite \u0393-invariant measure on X to\nG through f , we obtain a finite measure \u03bc on G invariant under the action of the\ndiagonal subgroup of \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 on (G, \u03c0g , \u03c0). It follows that t = id and gi \u2208 \u0393(Mi )\u22c4 .\nPut g = (g1 , . . . , gn ) \u2208 G.
