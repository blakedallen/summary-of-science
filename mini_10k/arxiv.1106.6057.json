Timmins for the ALICE collaboration\nDepartment of Physics, University of Houston, 617 Science and Research, Building 1,\nHouston, TX 77204, USA\nE-mail: anthony.timmins@cern.ch\nAbstract.\nWe present measurements of untriggered di-hadron correlations as a function of\n\u221a\ncentrality in Pb-Pb sN N = 2.76 TeV collisions, for charged hadrons with pT > 0.15\nGeV/c. These measurements provide a map of the bulk correlation structures in heavyion collisions. Contributions to these structures may come from jets, initial density\nfluctuations, elliptic flow, resonances, and/or momentum conservation. We decompose\nthe measured correlation functions via a multi-parameter fit in order to extract the\nnearside Gaussian, the longer range \u2206\u03b7 correlation often referred to as the soft ridge.\nThe effect of including higher harmonics (v3 and v4 ) in this procedure will be discussed.\nWe investigate how the nearside Gaussian scales with the number of binary collisions.\nFinally, we show the charge dependence of the nearside Gaussian.\n\nMeasurements of untriggered di-hadron correlations aim to explore the bulk\ncorrelation structures in heavy-ion collisions. All charged hadrons with pT > 0.15 GeV/c\nare used to form a correlation function, which for this analysis is defined as follows [1]:\n\u03c1sib \u2212 \u03c1ref\nd2 Nch \u03c1sib\n\u2206\u03c1\n(\u2206\u03b7,\n\u2206\u03c6)\n=\n=\n\u2212 1)\n(\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c1ref\n\u03c1ref\nd\u03b7d\u03c6 \u03c1ref\n\n(1)\n\nThe symbol \u03c1sib refers to the number of correlated and uncorrelated pairs (or pair\ndensity), where the hadrons used to form the pair come from the same event. \u03c1ref refers\nto the number of uncorrelated pairs, since the hadrons used to form the pair come from\ndifferent events. \u2206\u03c1 is therefore the number of correlated pairs. The denominator is the\nsquare root of the number of background pairs, so that represents the number of charged\nhadrons. i.e d2 Nch /d\u03b7d\u03c6. The correlation function therefore measures the number of\ncorrelated pairs per particle.\nFigure 1 shows the extracted correlation function as a function of centrality. The\namplitude of the longer range \u2206\u03b7 correlations grows from peripheral to mid-central\ncollisions, then falls slightly for central collisions. On the nearside, the most prominent\nstructure is a short range nearside spike, which sits on top of a longer range nearside\nGaussian. The short range spike was found to be from HBT and \u03b3 \u2192 e+ +e\u2212 conversions.\nElliptic flow is also prominent, and is represented by the cos(2\u2206\u03c6) structure, which is\nindependent of \u2206\u03b7.\n\n\fUntriggered di-hadron correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at\nPb-Pb 70-80%\n\n\u2206\u03c1/ \u03c1\n\nPb-Pb 60-70%\n\n\u221a\n\nsN N = 2.76 TeV from ALICE 2\n\nPb-Pb 50-60%\n\nPb-Pb 40-50%\n\nref\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n\u2206\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\nd) 0\n\n-1.5 -1\n\n0.5\n-0.5 0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\nd) 0\n\n-1.5\n\n-1 -0.5\n\n1 1.5\n0 0.5\n\n\u2206\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\nd)\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\n0\n-1.5\n\n-1 -0.5\n\nPb-Pb 30-40%\n\nPb-Pb 20-30%\n\nPb-Pb 10-20%\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 1.5\n0 0.5\n\n\u2206\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\nd)\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\n0\n-1.5\n\n-1 -0.5\n\n1 1.5\n0 0.5\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\nPb-Pb 0-10%\n\n2\n1\n\n\u2206\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\nd)\n\n0\n-1.5 -1\n\n-0.5 0\n\n0.5 1\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\n\u2206\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\nd) 0\n\n-1.5 -1\n\n-0.5 0\n\n0.5 1\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\n\u2206\n\n0\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\nd)\n\n0\n-1.5 -1\n\n-0.5 0\n\n0.5 1\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\n\u2206\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n(ra\n\nd)\n\n0\n-1.5 -1\n\n-0.5 0\n\n0.5 1\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\nFigure 1. Untriggered di-hadron correlations as a function of centrality in Pb-Pb\n\u221a\nsN N = 2.76 TeV collisions.\n\nWe attempt to characterise the longer range nearside Gaussian via a fit\ndecomposition. This structure is of particular interest, since there are various\ninterpretations with regard to its origin [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], some of which give quantitative\npredictions at LHC energies. It is sometimes referred to as the \"soft ridge\". The fit\ndecomposition is as follows:\n\u2206\u03c1\n(\u2206\u03b7, \u2206\u03c6) = Constant + Gauss(\u2206\u03c6, \u2206\u03b7) + A cos(\u2206\u03c6) + B cos(2\u2206\u03c6)\n\u221a\n\u03c1ref\n+ C cos(3\u2206\u03c6) + D cos(4\u2206\u03c6)\nWe extract the 2D Gaussian terms (Gauss(\u2206\u03c6, \u2206\u03b7)) under two scenarios: the first fixes\nC = D = 0, the second allows C and D to free parameters, which in turn enables higher\norder harmonics to be included in the prescription. The B cos(2\u2206\u03c6) term originates\nfrom elliptic flow, while A cos(\u2206\u03c6) term may have a variety of origins e.g. momentum\nconservation, directed flow, and/or awayside jets. Bins in the region which covers a\ncircle centered at 0,0 with a of radius 0.5 are given zero weight in the fit, to prevent\nthe spike influencing the fit. The \u03c72 /dof for both scenarios varies between 1 \u2192 1.5 and\nno remaining structures were found to exist in the 2D residuals. Figure 2 shows the\nextracted nearside Gaussian parameters. Previous analyses at RHIC energies negated\nthe higher harmonic terms [1, 7], and we find the nearside Gaussian without higher\nharmonics behaves in a similar way: a substantial growth is seen for both the amplitude\nand the \u2206\u03b7 width.

Boxed errors are described earlier, line errors indicate\nsystematic uncertainties in normalisation of correlation function. Gaussian fits are\ndone in the |\u2206\u03b7| > 0.5 region.\n\nis clear that unlike sign pairs contribute more to the near structure within ALICE's\nacceptance. Like sign pairs have a broader structure. If the nearside Gaussian were\ndriven only by a flow mechanism which acts on charged hadrons independent of charge\nsign, one would expect no charge dependence, which is in contrast to our data.\nIn summary, we have measured untriggered di-hadron correlations in Pb+Pb\n\u221a\nsN N = 2.76 TeV collisions. A pronounced change in the correlation structure\nfrom peripheral to central collisions is observed. We have quantified the nearside\nGaussian with two methods: including and omitting higher harmonics which has a\nsignificant effect on the extracted Gaussian parameters. The extracted Gaussian integral\nwith higher harmonics scales with the number of binary collisions, within the quoted\nuncertainties. Finally, we observe a charge sign dependence for the nearside Gaussian:\nunlike sign correlations are narrower and stronger within ALICE's acceptance.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n\nJ.
