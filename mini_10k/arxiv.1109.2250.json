Introduction\nZnO is a wide band gap semiconductor. It has a Wurzite structure with lattice\nconstants of a = b = 3.25 \u00c5 and c = 5.207 \u00c5. It has a direct bandgap of 3.3eV and the\nfundamental absorption even at room temperature shows excitonic contribution due to its\nlarge excitonic binding energy (~ 60meV)1,2. One of the interesting features of ZnO is the\npossibility to tune its band gap by substituting (alloying) bivalent metals like Cd and Mg in\nplace of Zn to its band gap. While Cd is known to reduce the band gap3, Mg substitution\nleads to enhancement of band gap4. This raises the possibility of band gap engineered\nheterostructure for optoelectronics applications in the UV range5.\nSynthesis of ZnO for optoelectronics applications are generally done through vapor\nphase deposition with or without catalyst. Routes that have been used to prepare ZnO and\nZn1-xMgxO alloys are Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)6, Vapor liquid solid phase growth4\nPulsed Laser Deposition (PLD)7 and Metallo-organic Vapor Phase Epitaxial growth\n(MOVPE)8. Materials obtained are mostly films or rods. In addition, a very low temperature\n(\u2264 100 0C) solution route has been used to fabricate aligned nanorods of ZnO9. In a recent\npaper Mg substituted ZnO (Zn1-xMg xO) nanorod synthesized by hydrothermal method (100o\nC) has been reported10. The advantage of the solution route is that it can give high quality\ncrystalline materials through an energy efficient route that allows wide area growth (e.g., 4\"\nSi wafer). Our principal motivation is to explore whether such a low temperature route will\nallow us to grow well-characterized Mg substituted nanocrystals of ZnO as an optical\nmaterial. In the solution route for material synthesis the mixing occurs at the atomic level and\nthe material made by this method is close to the thermodynamic equilibrium phase.\nOne of the important issues that limits synthesis of MgO alloyed ZnO is the fact that\nthe thermodynamic solubility limit of MgO in ZnO is \u2248 4 at. %11. The issue of Mg\nincorporation in ZnO in excess of 4 at% without phase segregation is an important and\ntopical research problem. It has been claimed that using the vapor phase route such as pused\nlaser deposition it is possible to incorporate Mg up to ~ 40 at.%4. For MOVPE grown films\nthe Mg incorporation has been reported to be ~49 at%.8. For ZnO grown solution route x~\n0.25 has been reported to be achieved10. In this paper we would like to explore a very specific\nquestion- to what extent one can incorporate Mg into ZnO nanocrytals using low temperature\nsolution route (growth temperature < 700C) and the resulting quality of the material as\ncharacterized by structural and optical means. We show that such a low temperature route can\nbe used to make the alloy Zn1-xMgxO with x as large as 0.17. Above this composition the\nMgO segregates. Up to this composition the alloy retains a Wurzite structure and the lattice\nconstants changes smoothly as x is varied albeit by a small amount. The phase segregation for\nx > 0.20 has been established by XRD as well as TEM studies. However, even with such low\nincorporation of Mg there are important and distinct changes in the optical properties of the\nmaterial. The alloy nanocrystals show an enhanced band gap that reaches \u2248 4.0 eV for x \u2248\n0.17 and an appreciable near band edge Photoluminescence (PL) response when excited with\nUV radiation. The near band edge UV emission occurs at room temperature and the emission\nshows blue shift as x is increased. The choices of nanocrystals rather than nanorods for this\nwork are two fold. First, working with good quality nanocrystals allows us to use the Rietveld\nanalysis12 for the x-ray diffraction to get a more quantitative evaluation of lattice constants,\nwhich is not possible with aligned rods. Second, ZnO nanocrystals showing good optical\nproperties are basic building blocks for all applications and can often be used directly for\nmany optoelectronic applications. It is like a quantum dot operating in the UV.\nWhile investigating the effect of Mg substitution on the band gap one needs caution.\nThis is because if the particle size is smaller than 5 nm, the effect of quantum confinement\nplays a significant role and the band gap becomes a function of the size13. While making the\n\n2\n\n\falloy, if a strict control of the size is not achieved then two effects (one from quantum\nconfinement, and other due to Mg substitution) will make comparable contribution and one\nmay not be able to separate out the two effects. In this work we used nanocrystals in the size\nrange 10-12 nm. In this range the quantum effects make negligible contribution. As a result\nwe can cleanly isolate the effect of Mg substitution on the optical properties.\n2. Experimental\nZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using acetate route. 0.03 M NaOH solution in\nethanol is slowly added in 0.01 M solution of Zn(CH3COO)2, 2H2O in ethanol kept at 65o C.\nThe final solution was stirred and heated at 65 oC for two hours. This method allows\nprecipitation of ZnO nanoparticles and avoids precipitation of hydroxides if the temperature\nis more than 60 0C. For the purpose of making alloy, we have added Mg(CH3COO)2, 4H2O\nwith the Zn(CH3COO)2, 2H2O solution and same procedure as described above have been\nfollowed. To vary the doping concentration, the relative concentration of Mg(CH3COO)2,\n4H2O and Zn(CH3COO)2, 2H2O in the solution were varied. The temperature at which\nreaction occurs can be varied from 60 oC to 75 oC. To eliminate the large particle, the\nsamples in solution phase were centrifuged for 2 minute at 2000 rpm. The dispersion\ncontaining the smaller particles were again centrifuged for 6 minute at 9000 rpm. The\nprecipitates were collected, washed by water and centrifuged again at 9000 rpm. The final\nprecipitates were collected by dispersing them in ethanol. All the optical measurements have\nbeen performed in solution phase taking the dispersed sample within a cuvette. For XRD\ninvestigation, washed residues were collected and dried within a hot air oven at temperature\n120o C.\nThe chemical compositions (x) were confirmed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic\nEmission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)) and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis. (We note that in\ngeneral, most past studies (since they were mostly done on film) could not provide an\nindependent quantitative analysis of exact Mg content after alloying ).\nThe nanoparticles were imaged using TEM and their lattice images were taken with a\nJEOL HR-TEM (at 200 KeV). The crystal structure of the ZnO and Zn1-xMgxO alloy\nnanocrystals were studied by means of Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diffraction data.\nCombination of XRD and the TEM studies helped us to analyze what happens when Mg is\nprogressively alloyed in ZnO. Room temperature optical properties were studied by UV\u2013\nvisible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450) and photoluminescence spectrometer\n(JOBIN YVON \u2013 FluoroMax\u20133) where a Xenon arc-lamp has been used as illumination\nsource.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1 ICP-AES AND TEM ANALYSIS: The basic characterization of the nanoparticles were\ndone through Inductive Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and\nTEM in addition to XRD. The result of the XRD analysis are given in the subsequent subsection. We determine the exact chemical composition of the particles using the ICP-AES\ntechnique which show that the maximum composition of Mg that we could get into the\nnanocrystals correspond to x \u2248 0.17. The analysis of the chemical composition by analytical\nquantitative technique like the ICP-AES is important because it establishes exactly how much\nMg can be incorporated into ZnO. This is larger than the equilibrium composition (x ~ 0.04)\nbut much less than what has been reported for vapor phase methods4. In figure.1 we show the\n\n3\n\n\fvalue of exact 'x' as determined through ICP-AES analysis vs the molar fraction of\nMg(CH3COO)2, 4H2O added in the Zn(CH3COO)2, 2H2O solution. For samples greater than\nx = 0.17 the resulting nanocrystals is not single phase as we will show form the XRD and the\nTEM data. They show phase separation between two phases viz. wurtzite ZnO and brucite\nMg(OH)2 (this will be seen more clearly from the XRD investigation discussed later). Sample\nwith x = 0.52 show a thin layer of Mg(OH)2 on the Zn1-xMgxO nanoparticles forming a coreshell structure.\nRecently it has been established that the doping efficiency is determined by the\nbinding energy of dopant atoms on the individual nanocrystal surface14. The binding energy\nfor wurtzite nanocrystal is three times less than that of zinc blend or rocksalt structure on\n(001) faces. Therefore the low concentration of incorporated Mg is likely to be a consequence\nof lower doping efficiency of the wurtzite ZnO nanocrystals surfaces.\nTEM images of the ZnO (undoped) nanocrystals with a uniform size distribution\n(average diameter~ 10 nm) are shown in figure 2. Figure 2(a) shows the TEM image of a\ncollection of the particles. The lattice fringes and selected area electron diffraction (SAED)\npattern of a single particle is shown in fig. 2(b) and 2(c) respectively. The SAED confirms the\nhexagonal symmetry of the particles. The distance between the parallel lattice fringes of the\nundoped ZnO particle is 2.62 \u00c5. The particles obtained by this method are well defined\ncrystals. In figure 3(a) we show a typical HR-TEM image of an alloy (Zn1-xMgxO)\nnanoparticle with x=0.17. The distance between the parallel lattice planes is very similar to\nthat of the undoped crystals (~2.60\u00c5). Figure 3.(b) shows the SAED pattern of the same\nwhich confirms that the hexagonal symmetry of the ZnO nanocrystals are preserved on Mg\nsubstitution. The TEM images clearly establish that the Mg incorporation does not lead to\nany change in the crystal symmetry and the crystal structure upto about x \u2248 .17. This is an\nimportant observation because MgO has a rock salt structure and for higher concentration of\nMg one would expect segregation of phases.\nIn the following we establish through the TEM study (which will be later elaborated\nby XRD ) that on further addition of Mg there is no incorporation or alloying of Mg into the\nlattice. Instead there is a phase segregation. We observe (presented below) that for higher Mg\nincorporation there is a clear appearance of XRD peaks due to Mg(OH)2 brucite structure.\nFigure. 4 shows the TEM images of the same sample grown with condition of 55 mole %\nMg(CH3COO)2, 4H2O in the solution (x = 0.52) which clearly shows a thin layer of Mg(OH)2\non the Zn1-xMgxO core. Upper part of the figure represent a single particle which shows a thin\nring around the core. Lower part shows the HRTEM image taken at the junction of the thin\nlayer and the core which clearly establishes the existence of two phases on the two sides of\nthe junction. The left one shows uniformly spaced lattice fringes and two spots on the SAED\npattern (left most part, indicated by an arrow) which confirms the existence of single phase.\nThe phase was identified as Mg(OH)2 by the XRD data as it shows two distinct peaks\n(corresponding to two spots in the SAED pattern) due to (100) and (110) planes of brucite\nMg(OH)2. On the right side of the junction, lattice fringes are overlapped and this indicates\nmixture of two phases (wurtzite Zn1-xMgxO with Mg(OH)2 as cover layer). This fact is also\nclear from the SAED pattern ( right most figure indicated by an arrow) which shows diffused\npattern, again indicating a phase mixture. From the XRD data, the core structure of this\nsample can be easily identifiable as wurtzite Zn1-xMgxO.\nTo summarize this section we find that Mg can be incorporated upto x \u2248 0.17 in the\nalloy Zn1-xMgxO nanoparticles by low temperature solution method without phase\nsegregation and retaining the Wurzite structure of the parent ZnO system. The resulting\nnanoparticles (diameter ~ 10-12 nm) are single crystals. Further addition leads to phase\nsegregation that creates a core of the alloy Zn1-xMgxO and a shell of the Mg(OH)2. (Note: The\nEDX taken in the TEM also allows one to evaluate the Mg concentration in the nanoparticles.\n\n4\n\n\fA comparison with ICP-AES measurements shows that the concentration determined by\nEDX alone overestimates x severely. We have used the ICP-AES results because the method\nis more standardized with available standards.)\n3.2 X-RAY DIFFRACTION AND ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURAL DATA: One of the\nimportant issue in the alloy Zn1-xMgxO formation is the change in the lattice constant when\nMg is incorporated. Mg2+ and Zn2+ have similar ionic radii - 0.57\u00c5 and 0.60 \u00c5 respectively15.\nThe alloy formation is thus expected to give a small change in the lattice constants due to the\nsmaller size (~5%) of the Mg ions. Although Zn and Mg have very comparable ionic radii,\nthe crystal structures of MgO and ZnO are different and it is expected that at certain\nconcentration of Mg the simple substitution has to terminate. As shown in figure 5(a), the\nobserved powder data for Zn1-xMgxO can be indexed to wurtzite structure upto x =0.17. This\nindicates that single phase Zn1-xMgxO nanoparticles form with Mg incorporation. However,\nfor higher Mg content ( x >0.17) additional peaks appear in the XRD data. These two peaks\nare due to (100) and (110) reflections of Mg(OH)2 as indicated in figure 5(a). This indicates\nphase separation between ZnO and Mg(OH)2. We have seen before in the TEM image (figure\n4) that this sample shows a core-shell structure of a thin layer of Mg(OH)2 on the Zn1-xMgxO\ncore .\nThe crystal structure were investigated by analyzing the XRD data ( upto x = 0.17 )\nby full line profile fitting using Rietveld method .The fit of the data have been shown as a\nsolid line in figure 5(a). In the least square refinement peak shape was assumed to be Pseudovoigt. An example of the residue of the fitting is shown in the figure for x = 0 data. The\nprofile fitting to determine the lattice constants assumed that the Mg is on substitutional sites\nand it occupies these sites randomly. One obtains good fitting with low residue with this\nassumption. We can thus conclude that the alloy formation does occur with Mg randomly\nsubstituting for Zn. The HR-TEM lattice images also corroborates this.\nAs shown in figure 5(a), the peaks in the powder XRD of the nanocrystals shift to\nhigher angle as x is increased, indicating decrease in the lattice constants of the ZnO due to\nincorporation of Mg. The lattice constants (a,b,c) and the cell volume V (=0.866a2c for\nhexagonal lattice) were determined from the full profile fitting of the observed data. As\nplotted in figure 5(b) the lattice constants as well as the cell volume decrease monotonously\nas x is increased. We observed 0.3 % change in the c-axis length which is smaller than the\napproximate decrease in the value of the c-axis lattice constant (\u2248 0.6% for x=0.2) observed\nin MOVPE grown Zn1-xMgxO alloy films8. Thus, the lattice constant depends on the method\nof growth. The Rietveld analysis shows that the lattice constant a(=b) changes by even a\nsmaller amount ~ 0.15% for the same Mg concentration. The XRD studies show that the\nmain effect of Mg substitution is compaction along the c-axis which in turn leads to a\ncompaction of the unit cell volume.\nThe XRD data were also used to find the average particle size and strain using\nWilliamson-Hall (W-H) analysis using simplified integral breadth method16. The Integral\nBreadth(\u03b2), defined as the ratio between peak area and the intensity maxima for both size and\nstrain broadened profile is given by16\n\u03b2* = 1/D + 2.\u03b5.s\n\n(in sin\u03b8 scale)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2* = \u03b2cos\u03b8/\u03bb , \u03b5 is strain and s = 2sin\u03b8/\u03bb.\nThe average particle diameter was obtained form this analysis and this match with that found\nfrom the TEM. W-H analysis also allows us to find the average strain from the slope of the\n\n5\n\n\flinear fit of the data points. The strain values calculated by this method were plotted with the\nMg content 'x' in fig.6. For low x , the strain is within the range \u03b5 \u2248 1-5 x 10-3 which is\nsimilar to that seen in undoped (x=0) nanocrystals. Although there is a gradual increase in \u03b5\nas x increases, for x \u2265 0.17 there is a sudden increase in the strain value by a large amount.\nInterestingly this is the value of x for which the phase segregation takes place. The XRD data\n(along with the TEM data) provides clear evidence for the phase segregation. It therefore\nappears that the phase segregation is driven by the built in strain on Mg incorporation.\nTo summarize, the extensive analysis the XRD data shows that Mg can be incorporated\nin the ZnO forming the random substitutional alloy Zn1-xMgxO for x \u2264 0.17. It is important to\nestablish that the material thus formed has the Mg in the substitutional sites. The substitution\nleads to a compaction of the c-axis lattice constant. However, for higher values of x there is a\nphase segregation, which is corroborated by TEM results presented in previous subsection.\n\n3.3 OPTICAL PROPERTIES:\nUV ABSORPTION: The room temperature UV-visible absorption spectra of ZnO and the\nZn1-xMgxO alloy nanocrystals were taken by dispersing them in ethanol. As shown in the\nfigure 7(a), a sharp absorption peak appears in the absorption curve due to the large excitons\nfollowed by the fundamental absorption. The sharp peak which has been identified as due to\nexcitons and is visible even at room temperatures due to the large exitonic binding energy of\nZnO (~ 60meV). The absorption curve shifts to higher energy in the alloy nanocrytals. In the\nsame graph we show the absorption spectra taken at room temperature in a single crystal of\nZnO (we refer to this as bulk). Compared to the Bulk the fundamental absorption edge is\nshifted by about 0.25eV in the nanocrytal (with average diameter ~ 10nm ). We observe a\nlarge and gradual blue shift of the absorption edge on Mg substitution. This is shown in\nfigure 7(b) where we plot the shift of the absorption edge energy (\u2206Eg) as a function of x for\nthe Zn1-xMgxO alloy nanocrytals. Interestingly the Eg shifts to as high as 4eV on Mg\nsubstitution. (As pointed out before it is not possible to have a tight control on the particle\nsize on Mg substitution. The particle sizes may vary by about 2nm on the average. However,\nfor an average size of 10nm, such a size variation (~2nm) can only produce a change in Eg of\nabout 0.05 eV 13. This is much smaller compared to the change in Eg seen on Mg substitution.\nFor the phase segregated sample (curve 5 in fig 7(a)), no more shift in the band gap value has\nbeen observed. Also the excitonic peak disappear from the absorption spectrum.\nNEAR BAND EDGE EMISSION: One of the exciting thing about ZnO is its ability to show\nnear band edge Photoluminescence (PL) even at room temperatures when irradiated by\nradiation with energies somewhat higher than the Eg. At room temperature in addition to the\nnear band edge (NBE) emission a lower energy emission is also seen. The deep level PL is a\nmatter of debate and is now established to be associated with defects. In figure 8(a) we show\nthe NBE emission obtained from the ZnO and alloy nanocrytals. The PL spectra when\nanalysed for different peak showed that it contains two main lines at 347 nm and 377 nm and\na weak line at 398 nm. All the samples were excited at 230 nm and have one peak located in\nthe UV region of the spectra which is due to the excitonic near-band-gap emission. In Zn1xMgxO there is a clear blue shift of the NBE as x is increased. This is shown in figure 8 (b).\nFor x = 0.17 the blue shift is nearly 12 nm. This is, however, less than the blue shift observed\nin the band edge from the absorption data (42nm).\nThe luminescence show a stokes shift to the lower energy side of the absorption edge\nwhich is very common in alloy semiconductors17. For instance undoped ZnO (x=0) shows PL\npeak at 377 nm whereas the Eg occurs at 354nm. On Mg substitution the PL peak shifts to\n365 nm while Eg=312nm for x = 0.17. The blue shift of NBE emission is because of the\n6\n\n\fdoping of Mg in ZnO. Since ZnO is a natural n-type material, the height of the Fermi level\nincreases and will be inside the conduction band due to the incorporation of Mg. The states\nbelow the Fermi level in the conduction band being full, the absorption edge shifts to the\nhigher energy18. The blue shift of the PL peak with x is also monotonous like the shift in Eg.\nThe NBE emission has details which are not seen in the room temperature spectra. It\nhas been established at least in bulk ZnO by PL investigations at low temperature that the\nNBE emission actually contains a number of lines that arise from free exciton as well as from\nexciton bound to impurities. The substitution by Mg can lead to redistribution of energy\namong various absorption lines to shift in the NBE, in addition to the blue shift of the PL\nmain line. Importantly these changes on substitution are substantial and they happen even\nwith small amount of substitution ( x < 0.15).\nThe NBE UV emission may get a contribution from Raman scattering arising from\nthe phonon modes. To check, whether it has a contribution from the Raman scattering, we\nvaried the excitation frequency and noted the NBE spectra. We find that the line positions\nmentioned as PL peaks does not shift with the excitation frequency.\nVISIBLE EMISSION: In addition to the near band edge emission the ZnO and Zn1-xMgxO\nalloy nanoparticles show considerable emission in the blue-green region at wavelength of\n~550 nm. This particular emission occurs in almost all samples of ZnO and its origin has\nbeen a topic of much discussion19. It is however, accepted that this emission has an extrinsic\norigin (defect mediated). The extrinsic nature of the 550nm emission can be seen from the\nfact that it depends on the surface condition and also the details of the preparation. In this\npaper we have also investigated briefly what happens to this emission on Mg substitution.\nHowever, the detailed investigation of this specific issue is beyond the scope of the paper.\nWe find that the effect of Mg substitution is two fold. First there is a nonmonotonous\ndependence of the intensity of the visible emission on x. Second, there is blue shift of the\nemission peak on Mg substitution.\nThe green emission, has a strong and non-monotonous dependence on x. The intensity\nratio of the visible to near band edge UV emission increases very rapidly up to x \u22640.05. An\nexample of the blue-green emission for low x is shown in figure 9(a) for x = 0.05. Further\nincrease in the Mg content reduces the intensity ratio between the two lines (figure 9(b) ). For\nx > 0.2, when the core-shell structure sets in there is complete quenching of the visible\nemission at 550nm, whereas the yield of the UV emission remains same. It is likely that the\nMg(OH)2 layer on the ZnO nanocrystals (revealed by the XRD and the TEM data) actually\nquenches the visible emission at 550nm. The quenching of the visible emission on formation\nof the core-shell structure is a new observation and has the possibility of its utilization in\ncontrolled optical properties of ZnO nanocrystals. A detailed investigation of the specific\nissue of the visible emission from Mg substituted ZnO is under way and is beyond the scope\nof the paper.\nAnother important effect of Mg substitution is the blue shift in the emission spectra as\nx increases. As shown in fig. 8(b) the visible emission is significantly blue shifted on Mg\nsubstitution, ranging from 550nm (x=0) to 514 nm (x = 0.17). On further substitution the\nemission intensity comes down as noted before.\n\nCONCLUSION: In summary, Zn1-xMgxO nanocrystals (with average size ~10-12nm)\nare synthesized by using a low temperature solution growth method (growth temperature 6075o C). The crystal structure analysis (based on the XRD data) and the TEM \u2013diffraction\npattern show that the Zn1-xMgxO nanocrystals have wurtzite structure as that of ZnO upto\n\n7\n\n\fx=0.17. Beyond that segregation of Mg(OH)2 occurs. The composition as checked by the\nICP-AES shows that EDX composition analysis (as is generally done in doped ZnO films)\nmay overestimate the actual Mg incorporation. Room temperature spectra reveals that Mg\nsubstitution leads to enhancement of the fundamental absorption edge from 3.55eV to 3.99\neV and the near band edge emission from 377 to 365 nm for x as little as 0.17. After phase\nsegregation, the excess Mg(OH)2 forms a layer on the nanocrystals, which quenches the\nvisible emission.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors want to thank Department of Science and Technology for financial support as\nUnit for Nanoscience.
