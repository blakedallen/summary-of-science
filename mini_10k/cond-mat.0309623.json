These theoretical [1, 2, 3, 4,\n5], experimental [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and computational [11] studies have been motivated by the\ndesire to understand the static properties of, say, a humble sandpile - to quote an important\nparadigmatic example [2]. It has been argued that these aggregates formed under gravity\nas external driving force - alongside with other special \"solids\" such as jammed colloids,\nemulsions or foams - may not necessarily be described as classical elastic or elastoplastic\ncontinuum bodies [2, 5, 11]. Hence, the interest to determine experimentally and by computer\nsimulation the linear and quasistatic response to a localized incremental force, in order to\ndistinguish between the different models proposed. In a nutshell, stress distributions below\nthe source rather close to classical elasticity predictions have been found for standard sand,\nalthough minor differences seem to appear in the distribution tails [8]. This has prompted\nthe more recent focus on the fact that these systems are typically composed of a small\nnumber of constituents [5], and on the paramount role of the quenched disorder [3].\nIn this paper, the point source response problem is carried over to a definitely much\nsimpler disordered model system, the two-dimensional amorphous solid formed by quenching\na Lennard-Jones fluid. It is well known for amorphous materials such as metallic, organic\nor mineral glasses, that their mechanical properties are quite different from those of the\ncorresponding crystals at the same density [12, 13]. They are characterized by a large decrease\nin both the apparent shear and Young's moduli, and a large increase of the yield stress\nassociated with a localization of the plastic deformation [12, 13]. These properties have\nbeen interpreted in terms of local rearrangements [14, 15, 16, 17] due to the heterogeneity\nof the microscopic structure. But these rearrangements have never been identified clearly.\nParticularly, like in granular materials, the role of the quenched stresses is actually a matter\nof debate [18, 19], as well as the role of local heterogeneities in the elastic constants of\nthe materials. One way to answer those questions experimentally is to perform nanoscale\nindentation [21], that is to study the response to a point force.\nAs schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 (b) we study stress and displacement fields generated\nby an external force acting on the Lennard-Jones beads contained within a small disk.\nSnapshots of the incremental stresses and displacement fields presented in Figs. 2, 3 and 4\n2\n\n\fshow a rather noisy response. Since these systems behave clearly as classical elastic bodies\n- provided sufficiently large wave lengths and small forces are probed - they provide\nimportant reference systems, the results from granular matter may be compared with. The\nlinear response to point source is equivalent to the (noisy and position dependent) Green's\nfunction. To our knowledge this study presents the first systematic computational study of\nthis function, extending some aspects discussed only recently [5]. Specifically, we investigate\nhow this noise affects the averages compared to classical continuum theory, and how the\ndistributions get narrower with increasing distance from the source, due to self-averaging.\nThe spatial correlations of the responses of close sources are studied in order to verify whether\ndomains of different rigidity exist as has been argued recently [18, 19, 20].\nThis work is in fact the natural sequel of our study [22, 23] where the applicability\nof classical elastic continuum theory on small length scales has been tested by comparing\nwith theory the low end of the eigenfrequency spectrum obtained by diagonalization of\nthe dynamical matrix. We found that only for system sizes and wave lengths larger than\na characteristic wave length, \u03be \u2248 30 interatomic distances, the eigenfrequencies show the\ndegeneracy predicted for a classical isotropic and homogeneous body. This surprising large\nlower limit for classical continuum theory is also seen in the characterization of the non-affine\nfield generated by macroscopic deformations (shear or elongation). Only after coarse-graining\nover distances of order \u03be does the non-affine response become negligible. This does in turn\nexplain why modes associated with smaller wave lengths do not behave as predicted from\nan approach formulated in terms of affine displacement fields.\nIn this paper, we describe first briefly some technical points related to the initial samples,\nthe computational methods and measurements. In the subsequent Sections III, IV and V, we\npresent our numerical results for stress and displacement fields, and their distributions. We\nhave regrouped our results following the three different boundary conditions investigated.\nIn the first section, we demonstrate that the self-averaging is characterized by a length scale\nsimilar to the critical wave length \u03be from our previous study. In the latter two sections\nwe analyze the source displacements and their correlations. Our results are summarized\nin Sec. VI. The analytical predictions from classical elasticity theory are outlined in the\nappendix.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL TECHNICALITIES.\n\nThe initial configurations and their preparation have been to some extent described in\n[23]. Of relevance here is a large ensemble of 16 independent configurations containing each\n10,000 Lennard-Jones particles quenched from T = 1 down to zero temperature following\na fixed protocol using standard molecular dynamics, steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods [24]. Note that, while the particle mass m is strictly monodisperse, we use\nsufficiently polydisperse particle diameters (uniformly distributed between 0.8 and 1.2) to\nprevent crystalline order. The linear size of the periodic boxes is L = 104, the corresponding\nvolume fraction 0.925. The mean pressure P = 0.25 was chosen to be close to zero. The two\nLam\u00e9 coefficients [23, 25, 26], \u03bb \u2248 39.5 and \u03bc \u2248 11.7, have been measured directly using\nHooke's law by applying macroscopic elongation and (pure) shear to the simulation box. We\nrecall that the associated Poisson ratio \u03bd = \u03bb/(\u03bb + 2\u03bc) \u2248 2/3 is larger than 1/2 which is\npermissible in a 2D solid. Here as everywhere below we have naturally given the numerical\nvalues in Lennard-Jones units.\nIt has been carefully checked that the initial configurations and their monomers are indeed\nat mechanical equilibrium, i.e. are sitting in (local) minima of the energy landscape. The\nlinear response to a small external force or imposed displacement can, hence, be described\nby means of the (2N) \u00d7 (2N) dynamical matrix M whose elements depend on the frozen\ntensions (\"quenched stresses\") and stiffnesses of the links between interacting beads [23]. In\nprinciple, it is straightforward to solve numerically the linear equations M * U = F . Here,\nF and U are the 2N-dimensional force and displacement fields respectively containing the\nimposed external body forces and displacements. Since we are considering very large systems\nand standard linear equation solver being of order N 3 we have mainly used (Sec. III and IV)\ndirect steepest descent and/or conjugate gradient methods which are in this case (where the\nneighbor contact lists remains constant) of order N. The advantage of the direct methods\nis also that they allow to probe the non-linear response regime. We have checked that both\nmethods yield the same results for sufficiently small external forces. For comparison, we\npresent in Sec. V results obtained directly from the dynamical matrix.\nIn all cases, as shown in Fig. 1(b), we apply a localized external force of f s /n0 to all\nthe n0 beads contained in small source disks of fixed diameter D. The center of the disk\nrefers naturally to the origin of our coordinate system (x, y). The special limit with sources\n4\n\n\fcontaining only one bead (n0 = 1, D \u2192 1) will be used in Sec. V. Obviously, the response\nbecomes locally less noisy with increasing source size. As we are interested in disorder on\ndistances larger than the typical particle distance we have also distributed the source over\nmore than one bead. Most of the results reported in Sections III and IV are for D = 4\ncorresponding to hn0 i \u2248 12 beads. All the source forces considered here point vertically\ndownwards. It turns out that an applied force of order one per bead is sufficiently small to\nensure linear elastic response for the direct minimization methods. (See Fig. 5 below.) The\naverages are taken over different disk positions in the same configuration, and also over the\nconfiguration ensemble.\nFor mechanical stability, we have either imposed a compensation force of \u2212f s /N on all\nbeads or fixed the positions of certain beads, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The first method has the\nadvantage of being free of any fixed boundary layer making it possible to use the full initial\nperiodic box. Care has to be taken however, in this case, for numerical reasons, because\nsmall drifts of the system cannot be completely avoided. The displacement fields must thus\nbe considered in the center of mass frame. Sec. IV presents results averaged over nearly 4000\nlinear responses obtained with this boundary condition.\nMost of the work presented in this paper (Sec. III, V) uses instead fixed beads to compensate the source force. Either we fix all beads in a horizontal layer with |y| > h and h \u2264 L/2\n(Sec. III), or all beads which are beyond a given number of topological layers around the\nsource particles (Sec. V).\nIt is well known for elastic bodies in two dimensions that stresses and strains far from\nboth source and boundary decrease inversely with the source distance r, i.e. the displacement\nfield varies logarithmically. Obviously, the response depends generally on the imposed boundary conditions. Details of the rigorous analytical treatment, exemplified for the boundary\nconditions studied in the next section, are outlined in the appendix.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS FOR FIXED TOP AND BOTTOM LAYERS.\n\nThe two snapshots of the forces and displacement fields depicted in Fig. 2 and 3 show\nthe response fields obtained in a small system of linear size L = 32.8 containing only N =\n1000 beads, but at the same volume fraction and pressure as the larger samples studied\nquantitatively below. The strength of the forces between beads are represented in Fig. 2\n5\n\n\fby the width of the lines repulsive (tensile) forces being black (gray). Only the incremental\nforces \u03b4f due to the source are given, i.e. the rather strong quenched or residual forces of the\namorphous body have been subtracted. The force chains visible resemble strongly the ones\nknown from granular matter [1, 5, 11], although our system is certainly a classical isotropic\nelastic body at large distances [23].\nThe displacement field \u03b4u = u \u2212 ucet indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3 has been obtained\nby substracting from the total displacement field u, the displacement field ucet calculated for\nstandard continuum elasticity theory (CET) [25, 26] following the prescription indicated in\nthe appendix. In other words, \u03b4u depicts the noisy response due to the quenched disorder.\nIn order to do a comparison of both snapshots, we show in Fig. 4 the residual displacement\nfield \u03b4u, and the noise component of the local incremental stress on each particle. In order\nto obtain the noise component, we have substracted the stress calculated with standard\ncontinuum elasticity theory, and the quenched stresses, from the total stress in the presence\nof a source. The total stress has been calculated here on each particle, using the standard\nKirkwood definition [5, 18]. The noisy part of the incremental stress is then represented\nby an ellipse centered on the particle, whose large principal axis is proportional to the\nlargest eigenvalue, and whose small principal axis is proportional to the smallest eigenvalue\nof the residual stress tensor. The directions of these axes give thus the main directions of\nthe incremental stresses. The snapshot of Fig. 4 shows clearly that \u03b4u is corrrelated to the\nlocal incremental stress. To get more quantitative results, we have drawn in the inset of\nFig. 4 the distribution of the angles \u03b8 between the residual displacements \u03b4u, and the main\ndirection of the incremental stresses (the direction associated to the largest eigenvalue).\nWe show a peak for zero angle, with a broad distribution (linear with \u03b8). The residual\ndisplacement field thus reveals a clear tendency to align with the main direction of the\nincremental stresses. On larger distances, however, we see a vortex like structure for \u03b4u\nsimilar to the structure revealed by the non-affine displacement field under macroscopic\nstrain found in [23]. The reason for this can be easily understood for the latter case where\nthe pressure must become macroscopically constant, and with it the particle density as well.\nThis generates the \"backflow\" of the non-affine displacement, just like in a uncompressible\nfluid. We recall that the continuum displacement field ucet for the point source problem flows\nalso back, but on a distance L/2 given by the system size. The size of the vortices measured\nin \u03b4u, however, does not depend on the system size. Note that, from one configuration to the\n6\n\n\fnext, the vortices are not located at the same place, and that they disappear after averaging\nthe displacement field over many configurations. Moreover, these vortices are not due to\nthe natural discretization of our system: they would disappear if the spatial distribution of\natoms were ordered, as can be infered from the direct computation of the Green function\n(see for example Ref. [27]). Note finally that the 3D case is now under study. We would not\nbe surprised if the size of the structure involved in the local rearrangements of the atoms\nwere smaller in the 3D case, due to the minor effect of disorder and the smaller range of\nelasticity [28]. However, systems with a very large number of atoms have to be studied in\nthis case [23] to fit with the continuum limit.\nFig. 5 shows the vertical normal stress \u03c3yy generated by one source of diameter D, at\na distance y = 50 below the source, i.e. just above the fixed beads of the bottom layer.\nAs in the snapshot Fig. 2, only the incremental stresses due to the source are shown here.\nTo make comparison between the sources of different strengths, the total vertical stress has\nbeen normalized to 1.\nThe stress tensor has been measured, as everywhere in the following, by means of the\nvirial definition [23] averaged over all beads contained in small rectangular volume elements\nof width 5 and height 3 centered at (x, y). Adopting in this work the sign convention usual\nin granular matter, compressive stresses are taken as positive, i.e. have the same sign as the\npressure. The size and the aspect ratio of the volume elements were chosen for convenience.\nA typical volume element contains 14 beads, and averages over about 100 interactions which\ntakes out some of the noise. On the other hand, it remains small enough to achieve a\ngood spatial resolution. Note that a given interaction may contribute to two neighboring\nvolume elements. Data points corresponding to two such elements are therefore statistically\ncorrelated, and the curves appear slightly smoother as they would otherwise.\nTwo additional points have to be made here. First, the responses compare already quite\nwell with the analytical prediction (bold line) albeit they are not averaged over different\nrealizations and despite the fact that the (not given) snapshot of the forces still looks quite\nnoisy. This is obviously to be expected for large distances from the source as the response in\nan elastic body should self-average over the noise. While we shall make this more quantitative\nin a moment, Fig. 5 shows clearly that a distance of order y \u2248 50 yields a reasonable -\nalthough not perfect - self-averaged response. This confirms our finding in [23] that systems\nof size L = 104 show accurately the lowest eigenmodes and can therefore be regarded as free\n7\n\n\fof finite size effects. This motivated our choice of this system size. Note that the continuous\nresponse and the response averaged over many configurations (bold line in the Fig. 5) coincide\nat this distance from the point source (see also Fig. 6 on this point).\nSecond, we note in Fig. 5 that the responses are identical for all systems where the forces\nper bead remain of order one or lower. This appears to be independent of the disk diameters\nD despite the additional beads charged for larger disks. Apparently, these differences at the\nsource are screened at y = 50 \u226b D. The response for D = 1 and fs /n0 \u2248 10 is different, as\nthe force per bead is outside the elastic regime. If we reduce the force per bead for D = 1\nfurther (filled circles) we obtain finally similar responses as for the larger disks. Note however,\nthat linear response requires smaller forces per bead for smaller disks than for larger ones.\nWe now consider the mean stresses, i.e. the stress profiles averaged over many realisations\n(different samples and different application points of the force). Far from the source, the self\naveraging discussed above implies that these mean profiles should behave in accordance\nwith CET. This is less obvious close to the source, where fluctuations from one realisation\nto the other are large. In Fig. 6 we present the normal mean stresses h\u03c3xx i and h\u03c3yy i as\nfunctions of x for different vertical distances y. Similar curves have been obtained for the\nshear stress h\u03c3xy i. The agreement with CET (bold lines) is surprisingly good even for small\ndistances from the source. It improves further with increasing distance y. Apparently, the\nnoise entering in the stress calculation is of (essentially) vanishing mean. While the vertical\nnormal stress must have always one peak centered below the source, the horizontal normal\nstress is predicted by classical isotropic theory to show a minimum at x = 0 between two\npeaks for D \u226a |y| \u226a h. This is a direct consequence of elasticity. The double peak disappears\nclose the fixed surface as there horizontal displacements which cause the tensile horizontal\nforces are suppressed.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 7 for the normal stresses, all measured stresses decrease essentially as the inverse distance from the source (taken aside the expected corrections due the\nfinite value of the system size). The two panels given in this figure correspond to measurements along two straight lines through the source: (a) x = 0, (b) x/y \u2261 tan(\u03b8) = \u00b11. Both\nfigures look qualitatively similar.\nMore importantly, we compare in both panels both normal average stresses with their\n\u0001\n2\n2 2 1/2\nrespective fluctuations from sample to sample \u03b4\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\ni \u2212 h\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\ni\n. We note first that\n\n\u03b4\u03c3xx \u2248 \u03b4\u03c3yy \u2248 \u03b4\u03c3xy (the latter relation not being represented in the figure) and that the\n8\n\n\ffluctuations do not depend on the angle \u03b8 of the straight line, but solely on their distance\nr from the source. Surprisingly, we find fluctuations of order of the mean (normal) stresses,\ni.e. the relative fluctuations are of order one close to the source.\n\n1\n\nThis striking observation\n\nis by no means in conflict with the observed self-averaging far from the source, due to the\ndifferent distance dependence of mean stresses and fluctuations. While the former decrease\n(essentially) analytically, our data suggests an exponential decay for the latter. Our fits are\ncompatible with a characteristic screening length scale b of order 30. Interestingly, this is\nof same order as the characteristic wave length \u03be we have found in [23] for the breakdown\nof the classical eigenmodes. Only for distances somewhat larger than b, the self-averaging\ndominates over the analytical decay of the average stresses, and the relative fluctuations\nvanish eventually.\nIn Fig. 8, we discuss in more detail the distribution of stresses along the x = 0 line through\nthe source. Only the vertical normal stresses \u03c3yy are presented here, as the histograms for\n\u03c3xx and \u03c3xy show similar behavior. The normalized histograms have been rescaled and\nplotted versus the natural scaling variable u = \u03c3yy /h\u03c3yy i which takes out the trivial distance\ndependence of the mean stress. Incidentally, as we know from Fig. 6, we may equally use\nthe analytically obtained stress as reference in the scaling variable, without changing the\nreduced histograms.\nThree remarks have to be made here: First, we note that all histograms scale reasonably\nwell and the fluctuations, i.e. the width of the unscaled peaks, scale broadly as the mean\nstresses. Closer inspection reveals, however, that the rescaled peak width becomes slightly\nnarrower with distance to the source. Both observations are obviously in perfect agreement\nwith the previous Fig. 7 where more or less constant relative fluctuation have been found\ndue to the large value of the self-averaging length b \u2248 h. This masks somewhat the different\nfunctional dependency (analytic versus exponential) of the first two moments of the stress\ndistributions. Second, the distributions are more or less symmetric and the mean stress\ncorresponds to the maximum of the histogram. This confirms the statement made above\n(Fig. 6), that the fluctuations around the analytical prediction appear to be of vanishing\nmean. Third, although our statistics is certainly insufficient to characterize much better the\nshape of the distributions, specifically the scaling of their tails, a Gaussian distribution can\n1\n\nFor symmetry reasons, h\u03c3xy i = 0 for \u03b8 \u2192 0 and the corresponding relative fluctuation diverges.\n\n9\n\n\fbe ruled out with the present data. In fact, as shown in the figure, an exponential fit is not\nunreasonable. In this sense the noise is large.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS FOR SYSTEMS WITH COMPENSATION FORCES.\n\nWhile the previous section was mainly concerned about forces and stresses and their\ndistribution, we will now, for the rest of this paper, investigate the displacement us of the\ncenter of mass of the source region. This is the direct route to characterize the local elastic\nproperties of an amorphous body. We use here open periodic boundary conditions without\nfixed particles, but with additional small compensation forces on all beads. As before, a\nvertically downwards pointing force acts on source disks of diameter D = 4.\nFig. 9 presents a typical snapshot of the noisy part \u03b4us = us \u2212 hus i of the source displacements measured in one configuration. For the given box size, the mean displacement\nsubstracted is roughly four times larger than the average fluctuation h\u03b4us 2 i1/2 (see Fig. 11\nbelow). Hence, the local elastic properties vary weakly with position. The snapshot (or a\nmore detailed histogram) shows the bimodality of the \u03b4us distribution: Few very strong displacements point downwards in the direction of the force. They are due to some very soft\nspots. The remaining \u03b4us are much smaller and strongly correlated in space. While pointing\npretty much in all directions, they compensate obviously the net downward component of\nthe soft spots.\nWe have checked the spatial correlations of the source displacements, by means of the\n(normalized) correlation function h\u03b4us (r) * \u03b4us (0)i which is summed over all pairs of displacements of a given configuration, and averaged over the configuration ensemble. In total,\nnearly 4000 responses contribute to the average correlation function presented in Fig. 10.\nFor very small distances, the correlation function should become constant since two sources\nof finite disk diameter excite the same beads. Equally, it is expected to become flat around\nr \u2248 L/2 due to the periodic boundary conditions. Both limits are in agreement with our\ndata. More importantly, the intermediate distance regime D/2 \u226a r \u226a L/2 may be reasonably fitted in log-log coordinates by a power law slope. Although a somewhat weaker value\nwould even fit a larger range of the data we have indicated an exponent \u22121. Interestingly, the\nsame dependency has been observed for the correlation function of the non-affine part of the\ndisplacement field discussed in Ref. [23]. Finally, we remark that an additional non-analytic\n10\n\n\fand possibly exponential regime for b \u226a r \u226a L/2 is conceivable for even larger boxes. This\nis suggested by the existence of the characteristic length b observed in the self-averaging of\nthe stresses. Unfortunately, as indicated by the broken line, this is at present not supported\nby our simulations due to the limited system sizes available.\nThe reader will have observed that we do not probe here the rigidity of an isolated patch\nof material in a fixed frame. The fluctuations of the source displacements do not depend\nonly on the local elements of the dynamical matrix but on a much larger neighborhood, in\nprinciple the whole system, whose effective size is estimated in the next section.\n\nV.\n\nRESULTS FOR FIXED TOPOLOGICAL LAYERS.\n\nFor solving the linear response directly by means of the dynamical matrix, it is useful\nto renumber and regroup the beads in topological layers around the source disk. All the n1\nbeads, interacting directly with the n0 disk beads, are contained in the first neighbor layer,\nthe n2 beads interacting directly with the n1 beads of the first neighbor shell are contained\nin the second layer, and so on (there are no direct interactions between the n0 beads of the\nsource and those of the second layer). Both the number of beads of each layer and the mean\nradius R of the fixed particle layer around the source increase linearly with the topological\nrank from the source. The width of a topological layer is of order 3 due to the cut-off of our\npotential and to the weak polydispersity [23]. The last layer of free particles containing nl\nbeads, we fix the positions of the N \u2212 (n0 + n1 + ... + nl ) > 0 remaining beads.\nWith this renumbering, the structure of the dynamical matrix becomes more transparent,\npicturing systematically the influence of the subsequent topological layers. While in the last\nsection all beads have been allowed to respond to the external load, we study here the\neffect of additional degrees of freedom when more and more topological layers and degrees\nof freedom are allowed to relax. The method used here is a systematic inversion of the\ndynamical matrix.\nAs in the last section, we only consider the displacement field at the source. In contrast,\nwe use a source containing only one bead (n0 = 1). The applied force is arbitrarily set\nto one. Obviously, the response of the source, when all other beads are fixed (l = 0), is\ndirectly described by the inverse diagonal coefficients of the dynamical matrix, which is a\nfunction of the local quenched forces and spring constants between neighboring monomers.\n11\n\n\fFor l > 0, the displacement U of the source can be computed recursively by writing the\nequilibrium equations on all free beads. For l = 2, for example, we get after combining all\nthe 2 \u00d7 (n0 + n1 + n2 ) equilibrium equations in the two directions x and y\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n\u22121\nF = Mn \u00d7n \u2212 Mn \u00d7n * Mn \u00d7n \u2212 Mn \u00d7n * Mn \u00d7n * Mn \u00d7n\n* Mn \u00d7n * U ,\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Mn \u00d7n is the matrix of size 2ni \u00d7 2nj containing all the coefficients of the dynamical\ni\n\nj\n\nmatrix relating the particles of the layer i with the particles of the layer j. The ratio us /fs ,\nof the vertical component of the source displacement to the applied vertical force, can thus\nbe easily computed, with the direct use of the coefficients of the dynamical matrix.\nThe vertical component of the source displacement us is shown in Fig. 11 as a function of\nthe mean diameter 2R of the spherical region around the source which is allowed to respond\nto an external force. The open symbols correspond to the (reduced) mean displacement\nhus i/fs , the filled symbols to the fluctuation h\u03b4u2s i1/2 /fs . The squares are for the responses\nmeasured numerically after relaxation in periodic systems of linear size L = 2R = 104\nwithout fixed beads (Sec. IV). Note that the response at the source depends of course on D\nfor all 2R.\n\n2\n\nWe show, that the mean displacement increases logarithmically with system size hus i/fs \u2248\n0.011 log(2R/D) in qualitative agreement with continuum theory and this already for systems with only one free topological layer around the source (l = 1). Hence, although l = 0\nis not sufficient, one can obtain the average local elastic moduli from a surprisingly small\nneighborhood region. Interestingly, the fluctuations level off at much larger distances of order of b = 30 (corresponding to l = 6 topological layers), as can be better seen from the\ninset. (It can be shown that the approach of the large system size limit is exponential.) This\nshows that, at system sizes of the order of the self-averaging length, the fluctuations become\nsystem size independent. For larger systems, b determines the size of the region responsible\nfor the noise in the source displacement field.\n2\n\nAs different D have been used for the two different boundary conditions, the results from the open periodic\nboundary method have been shifted vertically, taking into account the logarithmic correction suggested\nby continuum theory.\n\n12\n\n\fVI.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\n\nWe have probed the incremental stress and displacement fields due to a point source\nforce acting on two-dimensional amorphous Lennard-Jones solids. Focusing on the linear\nelastic response, this has been done for three different boundary conditions by means of the\nlinearized Euler-Lagrange forces (i.e., the dynamical matrix) or by direct minimization of\nthe total Hamiltonian.\nWe demonstrate that the average stresses and displacement fields compare well with\nthe predictions from classical isotropic elasticity, and this already for small distances from\nthe source and for small system sizes (Figs. 6, 11). Contrasting to this, large stress (and,\nhence, strain) fluctuations are found for small distances to the source decreasing (essentially)\nexponentially with distance (Fig. 7). A surprisingly large length scale b \u2248 30 is associated\nwith this self-averaging with distance. Similarly, the fluctuations of the source displacement\nfields are found to become system size independent for L = 2R \u226b 30. The self-averaging\nlength b is of the same order as the characteristic length scale \u03be associated with the non-affine\ndisplacement field under macroscopic strain setting the lower bound for allowing classical\neigenfrequency calculation to be applicable. We believe that both length scales express the\nsame physical fact and are indeed (up to prefactors) identical quantities. This explains why\nvibration modes corresponding to wavelengths larger than b (and, hence, averaging over\nlarger distances) follow continuum theory, while modes with smaller wavelengths do not\n[23].\nAs it has been pointed out, better statistics and much larger box sizes L/2 \u226b b \u2248 \u03be would\nbe required to establish unambiguously the scaling of the various distribution functions\ndiscussed here. Especially, an improved correlation function of the source displacements\nwould be highly interesting to test the range of the observed power law (Fig. 10). We\nstrongly expect the existence of final cut-off at a characteristic length of order b. Additional\ntheoretical guidance is also required to explain how such a large length scale arises for\nthe fluctuations given the short-range correlation of the dynamical matrix elements [23].\nThese results should be compared with experiments of nanoscale indentation on glasses [21],\nallowing a first experimental evidence of large scale fluctuations of the elastic properties in\namorphous materials. The study of the pressure dependence of our results is currently in\nprogress.\n13\n\n\fComing back to the static properties of granular aggregates (composed of hard, cohesionless grains in frictional contact) invoked in the introduction, this work suggests several\ncomputer experiments. As a first step, one should compare the average incremental stress\nand displacement responses. It may be interesting to verify if the double peak structure\nfound for the horizontal normal stress is also present in granular matter although there the\ntotal normal stresses may not become tensile. (A priori this is possible since the incremental\nstresses are perfectly entitled to become negative as long as Coulomb's criterion is not violated.) More importantly, the self-averaging properties of granular systems should be put\nto a test. Various experimental facts (especially for forces in vertical columns and silos) [2]\nsuggest much larger fluctuations with much weaker self-averaging properties compared to\namorphous elastic bodies. Finally, it is a matter of debate, if the response to an arbitrary\nweak source does correspond to a Green's function in a strict mathematical sense. Additivity,\nlinearity and reversibility of the responses should be tested directly. As the force network\nis subject to incessant restructuring due to the missing permanent grain contacts it may\nnot be possible to describe - even in the hydrodynamic limit - the total charging of the\npacking as a linear operation [2].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDuring the course of this work, we had valuable discussions from from P. Claudin, E. Duval, C. Gay and E. Kolb. Computational support by IDRIS/France and CEA/France is\nacknowledged.\n\nAPPENDIX A: TWO-DIMENSIONAL ELASTIC RESPONSE TO A POINT\nFORCE.\n\nAt equilibrium the stress state of a two-dimensional elastic material must satisfy the\n(two) force balance equations \u2207i \u03c3ij = F \u03b4(x)\u03b4(y) with i, j = x, y and F being the external\npoint force applied in (0, 0). The main assumption of classical elasticity [26] is that the\nsystem may be entirely described by the continuous displacement field ~u(x, y). Due to global\ntranslational and rotational invariance, only the strain field - by definition the symmetric\npart of the gradient of the displacement field - appears in the equations. Moreover in linear\n\n14\n\n\felasticity, the stress tensor is related to the strain tensor \u01ebij through Hooke's law. Only\ntwo phenomenological parameters are required for isotropic homogeneous systems, E and \u03bd\n(or \u03bb and \u03bc). Supposing this, it follows the compatibility equation [26] \u2202xx \u03c3yy \u2212 \u03bd\u2202yy \u03c3yy +\n\u2202yy \u03c3xx \u2212 \u03bd\u2202xx \u03c3xx = 2(1 + \u03bd)\u2202xy \u03c3xy and thus, combined with the force balance equations, the\nwell-known Laplace equation \u25b3(\u03c3xx + \u03c3yy ) = 0 for (x, y) 6= (0, 0).\nAs a specific example we present here the calculation for the point source problem between two fixed horizontal walls posed in Fig. 1(b). Hence, the displacement field ~u must\nvanish for |y| = h. Periodicity and symmetry of the simulation box in horizontal direction\nimpose a solution periodic and symmetric (odd or even) in x. These boundary and symmetry\nconditions can be readily reformulated in terms of the stresses.\nTo obtain the elastic response, the idea is to use the method presented in [7] in the case of\nan elastic layer submitted to a force localized at its surface. We divide our medium into two\nparts: part 1 above, part 2 below the point source. The continuity of the displacement field\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nalong the fictitious dividing line requires ux (x, 0) = ux (x, 0) and uy (x, 0) = uy (x, 0).\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe point force is taken into account by imposing \u03c3yy (x, 0) = \u03c3yy (x, 0) \u2212 p(x) where p(x)\nis the vertical external pressure. An additional constraint is imposed by the continuity of\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nthe shear stress \u03c3xy (x, 0) = \u03c3xy (x, 0). Note that the continuity of ux at y = 0 together with\nthe discontinuity of \u03c3yy imposes the discontinuity of \u03c3xx . Imposing a continuous \u03c3xx would\nyield to a discontinuous displacement field ux with large scale vortices [29].\nThe stress tensor components are decomposed into a base of harmonic functions, typically\naffine functions or product of trigonometric functions with exponentials. Taking into account\nthe x \u2190\u2192 \u2212x symmetry, we look for a solution of the type\n(1,2)\n\u03c3xx\n\n+\n\n(1,2)\n\u03c3yy\n\n=\n\n(1,2)\n(1,2)\n\u03c3xx\n\u2212 \u03c3yy\n=\n\n(1,2)\n\u03c3xy\n=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\ncos(qx) a(1,2) eqy + b(1,2) e\u2212qy\n\n\u0001\n\nn=0\n+\u221e\nX\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\ncos(qx) qy a(1,2) eqy \u2212 b(1,2) e\u2212qy + 2 c(1,2) eqy \u2212 d(1,2) e\u2212qy\n\nn=0\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nsin(qx) qy/2 a(1,2) eqy + b(1,2) e\u2212qy + c(1,2) eqy + d(1,2) e\u2212qy .

This setup has been studied extensively recently [2, 3, 8] in order to determine\nthe static response of packings of (hard and cohesionless) granular matter. (b) One of the three\nboundary conditions studied in this paper. The source is applied within a macroscopically isotropic\nand homogeneous \"computer solid\" in a periodic simulation box of linear size L. The center of the\nsource defines the origin of the coordinate system (x, y). For mechanical stability we either apply\na compensation force of \u2212f s /N (N being the total number of beads) to all particles or we freeze\nsome particles (gray beads) as shown in the right panel. We study the response of amorphous\npackings of carefully quenched (slightly polydisperse) Lennard-Jones beads. Obviously, this is a\nfurther simplification with regard to the granular material case with its more intricate non-linear\n(static friction) particle interactions.\n\n19\n\n\fFIG. 2: (Color online) Snapshot of the incremental forces in one small periodic box containing\nN = 1000 particles generated by the source applied on all the beads within the disk indicated. We\nhave chosen here a disk diameter of 4 particle sizes. The line width between interacting beads is\nproportional to the incremental forces. (Only forces larger than 0.02 have been drawn for clarity.)\nBlack (gray) lines correspond to incremental compressive (tensile) stresses. Also indicated on top\nand bottom are the beads fixed to balance the source. The snapshot shows that the forces generated\nby one additional source are strongly heterogeneous and resemble qualitatively the \"force chains\"\nknown from granular matter [2].\n\n20\n\n\fFIG. 3: (Color online) Snapshot of the (reduced) displacement field \u03b4u = u \u2212 ucet generated in\nthe same configuration as in Fig. 2. We have substracted from the total displacement field u, the\ndisplacement field ucet obtained analytically from classical continuum elasticity theory (CET). The\ndifference from continuum theory is quite marked for the displacement of beads on the \"force\nchains\" of Fig. 2. On larger distances rotatory structures become visible - quite similar to the\nones obtained from the non-affine part of the displacement fields under macroscopic strain [23].\n\n21\n\n\f0,8\n\n0,7\n\nP(\u0398)\n\n\u223c\u0398\n\n0,6\n\n0,5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0,5\n\n\u0398\n\n1,5\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) LEFT: Snapshot of the (reduced) displacement field \u03b4u = u \u2212 ucet superimposed with the noise component of the incremental stresses (that is \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3quenched \u2212 \u03c3cet ). The\nchosen configuration is the same as in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Stresses are represented by ellipses whose\nlarge principal axis is proportional to the largest eigenvalue of the local (incremental) stress tensor.\nThe small axis is proportional to the smallest eigenvalue of this stress tensor.
