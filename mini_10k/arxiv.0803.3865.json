Introduction\nWhat is the structure of irreducible representations of C*-crossedproducts A \u22ca\u03b1 G of an action \u03b1 of a finite group G on a unital C*algebra A? Actions by finite groups provide interesting examples, such\nas quantum spheres [1, 2] and actions on the free group C*-algebras\n[3], among many examples, and have interesting general properties, as\nthose found for instance in [9]. Thus, understanding the irreducible\nrepresentations of their crossed-products is a natural inquiry, which we\nundertake in this paper.\nAfter we wrote this paper, we are shown [11] where Takesaki provides\nin a detailed description of the irreducible representations of A \u22ca G\nwhen G is a locally group acting on a type I C*-algebra A and the\naction is assumed smooth, as defined in [11, Section 6]. Our paper\ntakes a different road, though with some important intersections we\nwere not aware of originally. Both our paper and [11] make use of the\nMackey machinery and the structure of the commutant of the image of\nDate: February 10, 2010.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46L55, 46L40, 46L45.\nKey words and phrases.

However, since our\nC*-algebras are not assumed to be type I, and in general the restriction\nof an irreducible representation of A \u22ca G to A does not lead to an\nirreducible representation of A, we need a different approach than [11].\nThe main tool we use for this purpose is the impressive result proven\nin [7] that for ergodic actions of compact groups on unital C*-algebras,\nspectral subspaces are finite dimensional. As a consequence, we can\nanalyze irreducible representations of finite group crossed-products on\narbitrary unital C*-algebras with no condition on the action of the\ngroup on the spectrum of the C*-algebra. More formally, we restrict\nthe assumption on the group and relax it completely on the C*-algebra\nand the action compared to [11, Theorem 7.2].\nOur research on this topic was initiated in a paper of Choi and the\nsecond author [4] in the case where G = Z2 , i.e. for the action of an\norder two automorphism \u03c3 on a C*-algebra A. In this situation, all\nirreducible representations of A \u22ca\u03c3 Z2 are either minimal, in the sense\nthat their restriction to A is already irreducible, or are regular, i.e. induced by a single irreducible representation \u03c0 of A such that \u03c0 and \u03c0\u25e6\u03c3\nare not equivalent. In this paper, we shall answer the question raised\nat the beginning of this introduction for any finite group G. Thus, we\nsuppose given any action \u03b1 of G on a unital C*-algebra A. In this\ngeneral situation, we show that for any irreducible representation \u03a0 of\nA \u22ca\u03b1 G on some Hilbert space H, the group G acts ergodically on the\ncommutant \u03a0(A)\u2032 of \u03a0(A), and thus, by a theorem of Hoegh-Krohn,\nLandstad and Stormer [7], we prove that \u03a0(A)\u2032 is finite dimensional.\nWe can thus deduce that there is a subgroup H of G such that \u03a0 is\nconstructed from an irreducible representation \u03a8 of A \u22ca\u03b1 H, with the\nadditional property that the restriction of \u03a8 to A is the direct sum of\nfinitely many representations all equivalent to an irreducible representation \u03c0 of A. In addition, the group H is exactly the group of elements\nh in G such that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1h are equivalent. The canonical unitaries\nof A \u22ca\u03b1 G are mapped by \u03a0 to generalized permutation operators for\nsome decomposition of H. This main result is the matter of the third\nsection of this paper.\nWhen G is a finite cyclic group, then we show that the representation\n\u03a8 is in fact minimal and obtain a full characterization of irreducible\nrepresentations of A \u22ca\u03b1 G. This result can not be extended to more\ngeneric finite groups, as we illustrate with some examples. In addition,\nthe fixed point C*-subalgebra of A for \u03b1 plays a very interesting role\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n3\n\nin the description of minimal representations when G is cyclic. We\ninvestigate the finite cyclic case in the fourth section of this paper.\nWe then apply our work to the case where G is the permutation group\nS3 on three elements {1, 2, 3}. It is possible again to fully describe all\nirreducible representations of any crossed-product A \u22ca\u03b1 S3 , and we\nillustrate all the cases we can encounter by examples. This matter is\ndiscussed in the last section of this paper.\nWe start our paper with a section on generalities on crossed-products\nof C*-algebras by finite groups, including a result on a characterization of irreducible regular representations. This section also allows us to set some of our notations. We now fix some other notations which we will use recurrently in this paper. Given a Hilbert\nspace H which we decompose as a direct sum H = H1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Hm of\nHilbert subspaces, we shall write an operator T on H as an m \u00d7 m\nmatrix whose (i, j)-entry is the operator pi T pj where p1 , . . . , pm are\nthe orthogonal projections from H onto respectively H1 , . . . , Hm . If\nt1 , . . . , tm are operators on, respectively, H1 , . . . , Hm , then the diagonal operator with entries t1 , . . . , tm will be denoted by t1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 tm , i.e.\n\u2295m\nj=1 tj (\u03be 1 , . . . , \u03be m ) = (t1 \u03be 1 , . . . , tm \u03be m ) for all (\u03be 1 , . . . , \u03be i ) \u2208 H1 \u2295 . . . \u2295\nHm . If \u03c0 1 , . . . , \u03c0m are representations of some C*-algebra A acting respectively on H1 , . . . , Hm , then the representation \u03c0 1 \u2295. . .\u2295\u03c0 m of A on\nH is defined by (\u03c0 1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 \u03c0 m ) (a) = \u03c0 1 (a) \u2295 . . . \u2295 \u03c0 m (a) for all a \u2208 A.\nThe identity operator of H will be denoted by 1H or simply 1 when no\nconfusion may occur. More generally, when an operator t on a Hilbert\nspace H is a scalar multiple \u03bb1H (\u03bb \u2208 C) of the identity of H we shall\nsimply denote it by \u03bb and omit the symbol 1H when appropriate.\nWe shall denote by f|E0 the restriction of any function f : E \u2212\u2192 F\nto a subset E0 of E. The set T is the unitary group of C, i.e. the set\nof complex numbers of modulus 1.\n2. Crossed-Product By Finite Groups\nIn this paper, we let A be a unital C*-algebra and \u03b1 an action on\nA of a finite group G by *-automorphisms. A covariant representation\nof (A, \u03b1, G) on a unital C*-algebra B is a pair (\u03c0, V ) where \u03c0 is a *homomorphism from A into B and V is a group homomorphism from\nG into the unitary group of B such that for all g \u2208 G and a \u2208 A\nwe have V (g)\u03c0(a)V (g \u22121) = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g (a). The crossed-product C*-algebra\nA\u22ca\u03b1 G is the universal C*-algebra among all the C*-algebras generated\nby some covariant representation of (A, \u03b1, G). In particular, A \u22ca\u03b1 G\n\n\f4\n\nALVARO ARIAS AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC LATR\u00c9MOLI\u00c8RE\n\nis generated by a copy of A and unitaries U g for g \u2208 G such that\n\u22121\n\u22121\nU gh = U g U h , U g = (U g )\u2217 and U g aU g = \u03b1g (a) for all g, h \u2208 G and\na \u2208 A. The construction of A \u22ca\u03b1 G can be found in [8] and is due\noriginally to [12].\nBy universality, crossed-products by finite groups have a very simple\nform which we now describe.\nProposition 2.1. Let G be a finite group of order n and write G =\n{g0 , . . . , gn\u22121 } with g0 the neutral element of G. Let \u03c3 be the embedding\nof G in the permutation group of {0, . . . , n \u2212 1} given by \u03c3 g (i) = j if\nand only if ggi = gj for all i, j \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1} and g \u2208 G. We\nnow define Vg to be the matrix in Mn (A) whose (i, j) entry is given\nby 1A if \u03c3 g (i) = j and 0 otherwise, i.e. the tensor product of the\npermutation matrix for \u03c3 g and 1Mn (A). Let \u03c8 : A \u2212\u2192 Mn (A) be the\n*-monomorphism:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\na\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u03b1g1 (a)\n\uf8fa.\n\u03c8 : a \u2208 A 7\u2212\u2192 \uf8ef\n..\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n.\n\u03b1gn\u22121 (a)\nThen A \u22ca\u03b1 G is *-isomorphic to \u2295g\u2208G \u03c8(A)Vg . In particular:\nM\nAU g = A \u22ca\u03b1 G.\ng\u2208G\n\nProof. The embedding of G into permutations of G is of course the\nstandard Cayley Theorem. We simply fix our notations more precisely\nso as to properly define our embedding \u03c8. A change of indexing of\nG simply correspond to a permutation of the elements in the diagonal\nof \u03c8 and we shall work modulo this observation in this proof. For\nb \u2208 Mn (A) we denote by bi,i\u2032 its (i, i\u2032 )-entry for i, i\u2032 \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nAn easy computation shows that:\nVg \u03c8(a)Vg\u22121 = \u03c8 (\u03b1g (a))\nand Vg Vh = Vgh for all g, h \u2208 G and a \u2208 A. Therefore, by universality of A \u22ca\u03b1 G, there exists a (unique) *-epimorphism \u03b7 : A \u22ca\u03b1 G \u0589\n\u2295g\u2208G \u03c8(A)Vg such that \u03b7 |A = \u03c8 and \u03b7(U g ) = Vg for g \u2208 G. Our goal is\nto prove that \u03b7 is a *-isomorphism.\nFirst, we show that \u2295g\u2208G AU g is closed in A \u22ca\u03b1 G.\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\nn\u22121\nLet (a0m , . . . , am\n)m\u2208N in An such that\nvergent sequence in A \u22ca\u03b1 G. Now:\n\n\u03b7\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\najm U gj\n\nj=0\n\n!\n\n=\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u0010P\n\nn\u22121\nj=0\n\najm U gj\n\n5\n\n\u0011\n\nm\u2208N\n\nis a con-\n\n\u03c8(ajm )Vg .\n\nj=0\n\nBy definition, we have \u03c3 gj (0) = i for all i \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}. Let\ngj\ngi\nj \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}. Then Vj+1,1\n= 1A and Vj+1,1\n= 0 for all i \u2208\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010 \u0010P\nn\nj\ngj\n= ajm for all m \u2208\n{0, . . . , n \u2212 1} \\ {j}. Hence, \u03b7\nj=1 am U\n1,j+1\n\nN. Since \u03b7 is continuous, and so is the canonical projection b \u2208\nMn (A) \u2212\u2192 b1,j+1 \u2208 A, we conclude that (ajm )m\u2208N converges in A.\n0\nn\u22121\nLet aj \u2208 A be its limit.\nin An to\n\u0010PThen (am ,\u0011. . . , am )m\u2208N converges\nPn\u22121 j gj\nn\u22121 j\ngj\n(a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ). Thus,\nconverges to j=0\naU \u2208\nj=0 am U\nm\u2208N\n\n\u2295g\u2208G AU g and thus \u2295g\u2208G AU g is closed in A \u22ca\u03b1 G. Since \u2295g\u2208G AU g is\ndense in A\u22ca\u03b1 G by construction, we conclude that A\u22ca\u03b1 G = \u2295g\u2208G AU g .\nNow, we show that \u03b7 is injective. Let c \u2208 A \u22ca\u03b1 G such\nthat \u03b7(c) = 0.\nPn\u22121\ngj\nThen there exists a0 , . . . , an\u22121 \u2208 A such that c =\nj=0 aj U . Let\nj \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}. Then \u03b7(c) = 0 implies that \u03b7(c)j+1,1 = aj = 0 for\nall j \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1} and thus c = 0.

Proposition (2.1) suggests that we construct some representations\nfrom one representation of A and the left regular representation of\nG. Of particular interest is to decide when such representations are\nirreducible. We will use many times the following lemma [6, 2.3.4 p.\n30], whose proof is included for the reader's convenience:\nLemma 2.3 (Schur). Let \u03c0 1 and \u03c0 2 be two irreducible representations\nof a C*-algebra A acting respectively on Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 .\nThen \u03c0 1 and \u03c0 2 are unitarily equivalent if and only if there exists a\nnonzero operator T : H2 \u2212\u2192 H1 such that for all a \u2208 A we have\nT \u03c01 (a) = \u03c0 2 (a)T . Moreover, if there exists such a nonzero intertwining\noperator, then it is unique up to a nonzero scalar multiple.\nProof. If \u03c0 1 and \u03c0 2 are unitarily equivalent then there exists a unitary\nT such that for all a \u2208 A we have T \u03c0 1 (a) = \u03c0 2 (a)T . In particular,\nT 6= 0. Moreover, assume that there exists T \u2032 such that T \u2032 \u03c0 1 = \u03c0 2 T \u2032 .\nThen T \u2217 T \u2032 \u03c0 1 = T \u2217 \u03c0 2 T \u2032 = \u03c0 1 T \u2217 T \u2032 . Hence since \u03c0 1 is irreducible, there\nexists \u03bb \u2208 C such that T \u2032 = \u03bbT .\nConversely, assume that there exists a nonzero operator T : H2 \u2212\u2192\nH1 such that for all a \u2208 A we have:\n(2.1)\n\nT \u03c01 (a) = \u03c0 2 (a)T .\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n7\n\nThen for all a \u2208 A:\nT \u2217 T \u03c01 (a) = T \u2217 \u03c0 2 (a)T .\nIn particular T \u2217 T \u03c0 1 (a\u2217 ) = T \u2217 \u03c0 2 (a\u2217 )T for all a \u2208 A. Applying the\nadjoint operation to this equality leads to \u03c0 1 (a)T \u2217 T = T \u2217 \u03c0 2 (a)T and\nthus:\nT \u2217 T \u03c01 (a) = \u03c0 1 (a)T \u2217 T .\nSince \u03c0 1 is irreducible, there exists \u03bb \u2208 C such that T \u2217 T = \u03bb1H2 . Since\nT 6= 0 we have \u03bb 6= 0. Up to replacing T by \u03bc1 T where \u03bc2 = |\u03bb| and\n\u03bc \u2208 R we thus get T \u2217 T = 1H2 . Thus T is an isometry. In particular,\nT T \u2217 is a nonzero projection.\nSimilarly, we get \u03c0 2 (a)T T \u2217 = T T \u2217 \u03c0 2 (a) and thus T T \u2217 is scalar as\nwell. Hence T T \u2217 is the identity again (As the only nonzero scalar\nprojection) and thus T is a unitary operator. Hence by (2.1), \u03c0 1 and\n\u03c0 2 are unitarily equivalent.\n\u0003\nGiven a Hilbert space H, the C*-algebra of all bounded linear operators on H is denoted by B (H).\nTheorem 2.4. Let G be a finite group with neutral element e and \u03b1\nan action of G on a unital C*-algebra A. Let \u03c0 : A \u2192 B (H) be a\nrepresentation of A and let \u03bb be the left regular representation of G\non l2 (G). Let \u03b4 g be the function in l2 (G) which is 1 at g \u2208 G and 0\notherwise. Define \u03a0 : A \u22ca\u03b1 G \u2192 B (l2 (G) \u2297 H) by\n\u03a0 (a) (\u03b4 g \u2297 \u03be) = \u03b4 g \u2297 \u03c0 (\u03b1g\u22121 (a)) \u03be, and\n\u03a0 (g) = \u03bb (g) \u2297 1H .\nThen \u03a0 is irreducible if and only if \u03c0 is irreducible and \u03c0 is not unitarily\nequivalent to \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g for any g \u2208 G \\ {e}.\nProof. Assume now that \u03c0 is irreducible and not unitarily equivalent to\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g whenever g \u2208 G \\ {e}. Suppose that \u03a0 is reducible. Then there\nexists a non-scalar operator \u03a9 in the commutant of \u03a0 (A \u22ca\u03b1 G). Now,\nwe observe that the commutant of {\u03bb (g) \u2297 1H : g \u2208 G} is \u03c1 (G)\u2297B (H),\nwhere \u03c1 is the right regular representation of G. P\nHence, there exist an\noperator Tg on H for all g \u2208 G such that \u03a9 = g\u2208G \u03c1 (g) \u2297 Tg . For\nevery \u03be \u2208 H and a \u2208 A, we have\n!\n!\nX\nX\n\u03c1 (g) \u2297 Tg \u03a0 (a) (\u03b4 0 \u2297 \u03be) =\n\u03c1 (g) \u2297 Tg (\u03b4 0 \u2297 \u03c0 (a) \u03be)\ng\u2208G\n\ng\u2208G\n\n=\n\nX\ng\u2208G\n\n\u03b4 g \u2297 Tg \u03c0 (a) \u03be\n\n\f8\n\nALVARO ARIAS AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC LATR\u00c9MOLI\u00c8RE\n\nand\n\u03a0 (a)\n\nX\ng\u2208G\n\n\u03c1 (g) \u2297 Tg\n\n!\n\n(\u03b4 0 \u2297 \u03be) = \u03a0 (a)\n=\n\nX\n\nX\ng\u2208G\n\n\u03b4 g \u2297 Tg \u03be\n\n!\n\n\u03b4 g \u2297 \u03c0 (\u03b1g\u22121 (a)) Tg \u03be.\n\ng\u2208G\n\nTherefore, for every g \u2208 G and for all a \u2208 A:\n(2.2)\n\n\u03c0 (\u03b1g\u22121 (a)) Tg = Tg \u03c0 (a) .\n\nSince \u03a9 is non scalar, there exists g0 \u2208 G \\ {e} such that Tg0 6= 0. By\nLemma (2.3), Equality (2.2) for g0 implies that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g0 , which\nare irreducible, are also unitarily equivalent since Tg0 6= 0. This is a\ncontradiction. So \u03a0 is irreducible.\nWe now show the converse. First, note that if \u03c0 is reducible then\nthere exists a projection p on H which is neither 0 or 1 such that p\ncommutes with the range of \u03c0. It is then immediate that 1\u2297p commutes\nwith the range of \u03a0 and thus \u03a0 is reducible.\nAssume now that there exists g \u2208 G \\ {e} such that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g are\nunitarily equivalent. Then there exists a unitary V such that for every\na \u2208 A:\n\u03c0 (a) = V \u03c0 (\u03b1g (a)) V \u2217 .\nLet us show that \u03c1 (g) \u2297 V is in the commutant of \u03a0 (A \u22ca\u03b1 G) . We\nonly need to check that it commutes with \u03a0 (a) for a \u2208 A.\n(\u03c1 (g) \u2297 V ) \u03a0 (a) (\u03b4 h \u2297 \u03be) = \u03b4 hg \u2297 V \u03c0 (\u03b1h\u22121 (a)) \u03be, and\n\u03a0 (a) (\u03c1 (g) \u2297 V ) (\u03b4 h \u2297 \u03be) = \u03b4 hg \u2297 \u03c0 (\u03b1g\u22121 \u03b1h\u22121 (a)) V \u03be.\nSince V \u03c0 (\u03b1h\u22121 (a)) = \u03c0 (\u03b1g\u22121 \u03b1h\u22121 (a)) V, we conclude that the two\nquantities are equal, and that \u03a0 is reducible.\nHence, if \u03a0 is irreducible, then \u03c0 is irreducible and not equivalent to\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g for any g \u2208 G \\ {e}.\n\u0003\nTheorem (2.4) provides us with a possible family of irreducible representations of the crossed-product. The representations given in Theorem (2.4) are called regular representations of A \u22ca\u03b1 G, whether or not\nthey are irreducible.\nHowever, we shall see that there are many irreducible representations\nof A \u22ca\u03b1 G which are not regular. Easy examples are provided by\nactions of finite cyclic groups by inner automorphisms on full matrix\nalgebras, where the identity representation is in fact the only irreducible\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n9\n\nrepresentation of the crossed-product. More generally, the conditions\nthat \u03c0 is irreducible and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g are not equivalent for g \u2208 G\\{e} are\nnot necessary. These observations will be placed into a more general\ncontext as we now address the question raised at the start of this paper\nin the next section.\n3. Actions of Finite Groups\nThis section is concerned with establishing results describing the irreducible representations of crossed-products by finite groups. The main\ntool for our study is to understand such actions from the perspective\nb of\nof the spectrum of the C*-algebra. In this paper, the spectrum A\na C*-algebra A is the set of unitary equivalence classes of irreducible\nrepresentations of A.\nWe start by two simple observations. Let \u03b1 be the action of a finite\ngroup G on some unital C*-algebra A. Let \u03c0 1 and \u03c02 be two equivalent\nirreducible representations of A, so that there exists a unitary u such\nthat u\u03c01 u\u2217 = \u03c02 . Then trivially u (\u03c01 \u25e6 \u03b1g\u22121 ) u\u2217 = \u03c0 2 \u25e6 \u03b1g\u22121 for all\ng \u2208 G. Moreover, \u03c01 \u25e6 \u03b1g\u22121 has the same range as \u03c0 1 and thus is\nirreducible as well. These two remarks show that for all g \u2208 G there\nb defined by mapping the class of an irreducible\nexists a map \u03b1\ncg of G on A\nrepresentation \u03c0 of A to the class of \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g\u22121 . Since (\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1g\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03b1h\u22121 =\nbh \u25e6 \u03b1\nbg = \u03b1\nb hg , and trivially \u03b1\nb e is the identity on\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1(hg)\u22121 , we have \u03b1\nb Thus \u03b1\nb\nA.\nb is an action of G on A.\nGiven a representation \u03a0 of the crossed-product A \u22ca\u03b1 G, we define\nb of all classes of irreducible\nthe support of \u03a0 as the subset \u03a3 of A\nrepresentations of A weakly contained in \u03a0|A . Our main interest are\nin the support of irreducible representations of A \u22ca\u03b1 G which we now\nprove are always finite.\n3.1. Finiteness of irreducible supports.

Let \u03c1 \u2208 G\nb and \u03bb be any irreducible representation\nso G\nof G of class \u03c1 acting on a Hilbert space H.

We define \u03c1 as the class of representations unitarily\nequivalent to \u03bb.\nLet B be a unital C*-algebra and \u03b1 an action of G on B by *automorphisms.

Define \u03b2 g (T ) = U\u03a0g T U\u03a0g\u2217\nfor all g \u2208 G and T \u2208 M. Then g \u2208 G 7\u2192 \u03b2 g is an action of G on M.\nLet now T \u2208 M such that \u03b2 g (T ) = T for all g \u2208 G. Then T\ncommutes with U\u03a0g for all g \u2208 G. Moreover by definition of M, the\noperator T commutes with \u03a0(A). Hence T commutes with \u03a0 which is\nirreducible, so T is scalar. Hence \u03b2 is ergodic.\nLet \u03c1 be an irreducible representation of G (since G is finite, \u03c1 is\nfinite dimensional). By [7, Proposition 2.1], the spectral subspace M\u03c1\nof M for \u03b2 associated to \u03c1 is finite dimensional. Since M = \u2295\u03c1\u2208Gb M\u03c1\nb is finite by [6, 15.4.1, p. 291] we conclude\nby Equality (3.7) and since G\nthat M is finite dimensional.\nDenote \u03a0|A by \u03c0 A . Let p1 , . . . , pk be projections in M, all minimal\nP\nand such that ki=1 pi = 1. Let i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. Then by definition of M,\nthe projection pi commutes with \u03c0 A . Hence pi \u03c0 A pi is a representation\nof A. Let q be a projection of pi H such that pi commutes with pi \u03c0 A pi .\nThen q \u2264 pi and q \u2208 M, so q \u2208 {0, pi } since pi is minimal. Hence\npi \u03c0 A pi is an irreducible representation of A.

Let \u03a0 be an irreducible representation of A \u22ca\u03b1 G\nand let \u03c0 A = \u03a0|A . Then for each g \u2208 G the representations \u03c0 A and\n\u03c0 A \u25e6 \u03b1g are unitarily equivalent. Hence, the decompositions in direct\nsums of irreducible representations of A for \u03c0 A and \u03c0 A \u25e6 \u03b1g are the\nsame.\nThis observation is the basis of the next lemma, which is instrumental\nin the proof of the theorem to follow.\nLemma 3.3. Let \u03b1 be an action of a finite group G on a unital C*algebra A. Let \u03a0 be an irreducible representation of A \u22ca\u03b1 G and let \u03c0 A\nbe the restriction of \u03a0 to A. Then there exists a finite subset \u03a3 of the\nb of A such that all irreducible subrepresentations of \u03c0 A are\nspectrum A\nin \u03a3. Moreover, all the elements of \u03a3 in a given orbit for \u03b1\nb have the\nsame multiplicity in \u03c0 A .\nb of A consisting of all\nProof. Let \u03a3 be the subset of the spectrum A\nclasses of irreducible representations weakly contained in \u03c0 A . By Theorem (3.1), since \u03a0 is irreducible, \u03c0A is a finite direct sum of irreducible\nrepresentations of A so \u03a3 is nonempty and finite.\nLet g \u2208 G. Now, by Observation (3.2), since \u03c0 A \u25e6 \u03b1g\u22121 is unitarily\nequivalent to \u03c0 A , its decomposition in irreducible representations is the\nsame as the one for \u03c0A . Thus, if \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a3 then \u03b1\nb g (\u03b7) \u2208 \u03a3. Since \u03b1\nb g is\nb\na bijection on A and thus is injective, and since \u03a3 is finite, \u03b1\nb g is a\npermutation of \u03a3.\nLet \u03a3\u03b1 be the orbit of \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a3 under \u03b1\nb and write \u03c0 A = \u03c0 1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 \u03c0 k\nusing Theorem (3.1), where \u03c0 1 , . . . , \u03c0k are irreducible representations\nof A, with the class of \u03c01 being \u03c6.

In particular, m(g)\n\u0011 is the multiplicity of \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1g in \u03c0 A .

So m(g) = m(e) by uniqueness of the decomposition.\nHence for all g the multiplicity of \u03b1\nb g (\u03c6) is the same as the multiplicity\nof \u03c6.\n\u0003\n\nWe now establish the main theorem of this paper, describing the\nstructure of irreducible representations of crossed-products by finite\ngroups.

We start our\nproof by making a careful choice of such an indexing. To do so, first\nchoose \u03c0 1 arbitrarily among all irreducible subrepresentations of \u03c0 A .\nOur next step is to set:\nH = {g \u2208 G : \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1g is equivalent to \u03c0 1 } .\nWe now show that H is a subgroup of G.

Hence, since the multiplication on the left and\nright by a fixed operator is WOT continuous, we conclude that Q\u03a0Q\nis WOT dense in B (QH). Therefore, by Equality (3.15), we conclude\nby the double commutant Theorem again that \u03a8 is an irreducible representation of A \u22ca\u03b1 H.\nLast, note that since \u03c0 1 is irreducible, if h, g \u2208 H then since:\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nV h V g V gh \u03c0 1 = \u03c0 1 V h V g V gh\nthere exists \u03bbg,h \u2208 T such that V gh = \u03bbg,h V g V h . Hence g \u2208 H 7\u2192 V g\nis a projective representation of H on H1 . Note that although the\nunitaries V h are only defined up to a scalar, there is no apparent reason\nwhy one could choose \u03bb to be the trivial cocycle unless the second\ncohomology group of H is trivial. We now note that J0 = J = Cr \u2297H1\nby construction. Now, for all h \u2208 H we set \u03c5 h = 1Cr \u2297 V h . Again, \u03c5 h\nis a projective representation of H. Moreover, for h \u2208 H:\nU1h \u03c5 \u2217h \u03c0 = \u03c0U1h \u03c5 \u2217h .\nSince \u03c0 = r * \u03c0 1 , Lemma (2.3) implies that there exist a unitary \u039bh \u2208\nMr (C) such that U1h \u03c5 \u2217h = \u039bh \u2297 1H1 . Hence U1h = \u039bh \u2297 V h . Now, for\nh, g \u2208 H we have U1h U1g = U1hg which implies that:\n\u0001\n\u039bh \u2297 V h (\u039bg \u2297 V g ) = \u039bh \u039bg \u2297 V h V g = \u039bhg \u2297 V hg .\n\nHence h 7\u2192 \u039bh is a unitary projective representation of H on Cr with\ncocycle \u03bb. Moreover, if T commutes with the range of \u039b then T \u2297 1\ncommutes with the range of \u03a8, which contradicts the irreducibility\nof \u03a8. Hence \u039b is irreducible. This completes the description of the\nrepresentation \u03a8.\n\u0003\nFor generic groups, the representation \u03a8 of Theorem (3.4) may not\nbe minimal, i.e. its restriction to A may be reducible. The simplest way\nto see this is by consider a finite group G admitting a representation \u039b\non Cn for some n \u2208 N. Then \u039b extends to an irreducible representation\n\u03a0 of the crossed-product C \u22ca\u03b1 G where \u03b1 is the trivial action. Thus,\n\u03a0|C , which decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible representations\nof C, must in fact be the direct sum of n copies of the (unique) identity\n\n\f20\n\nALVARO ARIAS AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC LATR\u00c9MOLI\u00c8RE\n\nrepresentation of C. Note that in this case \u03a0 = \u03a8 using the notations\nof Theorem (3.4). Thus, for any n \u2208 N one can find an example where\n\u03a8 is irreducible yet not minimal. This situation will be illustrated\nwith a much less trivial example in Example (5.6) where G will be\npermutation group on three elements. However, the representation \u03a8\nmust be minimal when the group G is chosen to be a finite cyclic group.\nWe develop the theory for these groups in the next section.\nBecause the representation \u03a8 of Theorem (3.4) is of central interest\nin the decomposition of \u03a0, we establish the following criterion for irreducibility for such representations. Note that the next theorem also\ndescribes the situation where the commutant of \u03a0 is a factor.\nTheorem 3.5. Let H be a discrete group. Let \u03a8 be a representation\nof A \u22ca\u03b1 H on a Hilbert space H and assume there exists an irreducible\nrepresentation \u03c0 1 of A on a Hilbert space H1 such that H = Cr \u2297 H1 ,\n\u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1h is equivalent to \u03c01 for all h \u2208 H and \u03a8(a) = 1Cr \u2297 \u03c0(a) for\nall a \u2208 A. Then there exist two unitary projective representations \u039b\nand V of H on Cr and H1 respectively such that \u03a8(U h ) = \u039bh \u2297 V h .\nMoreover, the following are equivalent:\n(1) \u03a8 is irreducible,\n(2) The representation \u039b is irreducible.\nProof. By\u0001assumption, for h \u2208 H there exists a unitary V h such that\n\u2217\nV h \u03c0 1 V h = \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1h and this unitary is unique up to a constant by\nLemma (2.3). From the last section of the proof of Theorem (3.4), we\nget that h \u2208 H 7\u2192 V h is a projective representation of H for some\n2-cocycle \u03bb and, since \u03c0 1 is irreducible, there exists a projective representation \u039b of H on Cr such that \u03a8(U h ) = \u039bh \u2297 V h , and moreover if\n\u03a8 is irreducible then so is \u039b.\nSuppose now \u039b is irreducible. Let T \u2208 [\u03a8 (A \u22ca\u03b1 H)]\u2032 . Since T commutes with \u03a8 (A) = 1Cr \u2297 \u03c0 1 (A), it follows that T = D \u2297 1H1 for\nsome D \u2208 Mr (C). Now T commutes with \u03a8(U h ) for all h \u2208 H, so\nD commutes with \u039bg for all g \u2208 H. Hence D is scalar and \u03a8 is irreducible.\n\u0003\nWe also note that the group H is not a priori a normal subgroup of\nG. It is easy to check that the following two assertions are equivalent:\n(1) H is a normal subgroup of G,\n(2) For all g \u2208 G, the unitary U\u03a0g is block-diagonal in the decomposition H = J0 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Jm\u22121 if and only if g \u2208 H.\nIn particular, when G is Abelian then for g \u2208 G we have \u03c3 g (1) = 1\nif and only if \u03c3 g = Id.\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n21\n\nWe conclude by observing that the representation \u03a8 involves projective representations of H. We now offer an example to illustrate\nthis situation and shows that this phenomenon occurs even when G is\nAbelian. We shall see in the next section that finite cyclic groups have\nthe remarkable property that such unitary projective representations\ndo not occur.\nExample\n\u0010\n\u0011 3.6.

Then an easy computation shows that\n\u039b\u2032 is a unitary projective representation of G on C2 associated to the\ncocycle defined by exp (\u2212i\u03c0\u03c3), and \u039b\u2032 (\u03b6) = V and \u039b\u2032 (\u03be) = U.\nLet B = A \u22ca\u03b3 G.

We start this section with the exploration of this\nconnection. Next, we propose a full characterization of irreducible representations of A \u22ca\u03c3 Zn .\n4.1. Minimal Representations. An extreme case of irreducible representation for crossed-products is given by:\nDefinition 4.1. Let \u03a0 be an irreducible representation of A \u22ca\u03b1 G is\ncalled minimal when its restriction to A is irreducible. Moreover, if \u03c0 is\nan irreducible representation of A such that there exists some irreducible\nrepresentation \u03a0 of A \u22ca\u03b1 G whose restriction to A is \u03c0, then we say\nthat \u03c0 is minimal for the action \u03b1 of G.\nSuch representations play a central role in the description of irreducible representations of A \u22ca\u03c3 Zn when \u03c3 is an automorphism of period n. We propose to characterize them in term of the fixed point\ncn of irreducible representations of Zn\nC*-subalgebra A1 of A. The set Z\nis the Pontryagin dual of Zn which we naturally identify with the group\nUn of nth roots of the unit in C. Let \u03bb \u2208 Un .

First, it is immediate that \u03b1ij is linear.\nNow, a simple computation shows that:\nU\u03a0 \u03c0(a)U\u03a0\u2217 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\u03bb1\n\u03b111 (a)\n..\n.\n\uf8fb\uf8f0\n..\n= \uf8f0\n.\n\u03bbp\n\u03b1p1 (a)\n\uf8ee\n\u03b111 (a)\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03b112 (a)\n\uf8ef \u03bb \u03bb \u03b1 (a)\n\u03b122 (a)\n\uf8ef 2 1 21\n= \uf8ef\n..\n\uf8f0\n.\n\u03bbp \u03bb1 \u03b1p1 (a) \u03bbp \u03bb2 \u03b1p2 (a)\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\u03bb1\n* * * \u03b11p (a)\n\uf8fa\n..\n..\n\uf8fb\uf8ef\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n.\n.\n* * * \u03b1pp (a)\n\u03bbp\n\uf8f9\n* * * \u03bb1 \u03bbp \u03b11p (a)\n\u03bb2 \u03bbp \u03b12p (a) \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa = \u03c0 (\u03c3(a)) .\n..\n..\n\uf8fb\n.\n.\n***\n\u03b1pp (a)\n\nTherefore for all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , p} we have that \u03b1ij (\u03c3(a)) = \u03bbi \u03bbj \u03b1ij (a).\nLet a \u2208 A\u03bc for \u03bc \u2208 Un , i.e. \u03c3(a) = \u03bca. Then \u03b1ij (\u03c3(a)) = \u03bc\u03b1ij (a).\nTherefore either \u03b1ij (a) = 0 or \u03bc = \u03bbi \u03bbj .\nIn particular, \u03b1jj is a representation of A1 for all j \u2208 {1, . . . , p}.\nIndeed, if a \u2208 A1 then \u03b1jk (a) = 0 if j 6= k and thus \u03c0 A (a) is diagonal.\nSince \u03c0 A is a representation of A, it follows from easy computations\nthat \u03b1jj are representations of A1 .\nNow, since A \u2295 AU \u2295 . . . \u2295 AU n\u22121 = A \u22ca\u03c3 Zn , every element of the\nn\u22121\nrange of \u03a0 is of the form \u2295j=0\n\u03c0 A (aj )U\u03a0j for a0 , . . . , an\u22121 \u2208 A. Now,\nn\u22121\nlet i \u2208 {1, . . . , p}. We observe that the (i, i) entry of \u2295j=0\n\u03c0 (a )U j in\nPn\u22121 Aj i \u03a0\nthe decomposition H = H1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Hp is given by j=0 \u03bbi \u03b1ii (aj ) =\n\u0010P\n\u0011\nn\u22121 j\n\u03b1ii\n\u03bb\na\nj=0 i j . Hence, the (i, i) entries of operators in the range of\n\u03a0 are exactly given by the operators in the range of \u03b1ii . Now, let T be\nany operator acting on H. Since \u03a0 is irreducible, by the Von Neumann\ndouble commutant Theorem [5, Theorem 1.7.1], T is the limit, in the\nweak operator topology (WOT), of elements in the range of \u03a0. In\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n25\n\nparticular, the (i, i) entry of T in the decomposition H = H1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Hp\nis itself a WOT limit of elements in the range of \u03b1ii since the left and\nright multiplications by a fixed operator are WOT continuous [5, p.\n16]. Therefore, the range of \u03b1ii is WOT dense in Hi . Thus, by the\ndouble commutant theorem again, \u03b1ii is irreducible.\nWe now turn to characterizing minimal representations. We first\nestablish a necessary condition.\nSuppose that there exists i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , p} with i 6= j and a unitary\nu such that u\u03b1ii u\u2217 = \u03b1jj . In the decomposition H = H1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Hp ,\ndefine the block-diagonal unitary\nDui = |1 \u2295 .{z\n. . \u2295 1} \u2295 u \u2295 |1 \u2295 .{z\n. . \u2295 1}.\ni\u22121 times\n\np\u2212i times\n\nThen by conjugating \u03c0 A by Dui , we see that we may as well assume\n\u03b1ii = \u03b1jj . Yet, this implies that in the WOT-closure of the range of \u03c0 A ,\nevery operator has the same (i, i) and (j, j) entry in the decomposition\nH = H1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Hp . Hence the range of \u03c0 A is not WOT-dense and thus\n\u03c0 A is reducible, so \u03a0 is not minimal.\nWe now prove that our necessary condition is also sufficient. Assume\nthat \u03b111 , . . . , \u03b1pp are pairwise not unitary equivalent. The claim is that\n\u03c0 A is irreducible.\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nT11 * * * T1p\n.. \uf8fb with respect\nLet T \u2208 (\u03c0 (A))\u2032 . Decompose T = \uf8f0 ...\n.\nTp1 * * * Tpp\nto the decomposition H = \u2295pi=1 Hi . Let i 6= j. First, note that if a \u2208 A1\nthen \u03b1ij (a) = 0. Second, since T commutes with \u03c0 A (a) for a \u2208 A1 , we\nhave:\n(4.2)\n\n\u03b1ii (a) Tij = Tij \u03b1jj (a) for a \u2208 A1 .\n\nBy Lemma (2.3), since \u03b1ii and \u03b1jj are irreducible and not unitarily\nequivalent for i 6= j, we conclude that Tij = 0. Moreover, for all\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , p} and a \u2208 A1 we have \u03b1ii (a) Tii = Tii \u03b1ii (a). Since \u03b1ii is\nirreducible, we conclude that Tii is a scalar. Therefore, the operator T\ncommutes with the operator U\u03a0 . Since \u03a0 is irreducible, we conclude\nthat T itself is a scalar. Therefore, \u03c0A is an irreducible representation\nof A and thus \u03a0 is minimal.\n\u0003\nTogether with Theorem (3.4), Theorem (4.2) will allow us to now\ndevelop further the description of arbitrary irreducible representations\nof crossed-products by finite cyclic groups. It is interesting to look\nat a few very simple examples to get some intuition as to what could\nbe a more complete structure theory for irreducible representations of\n\n\f26\n\nALVARO ARIAS AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC LATR\u00c9MOLI\u00c8RE\n\ncrossed-products by Zn . First of all, one should not expect in general that\u0014 the spectrum\nof U\u03a0 is a coset of Zn , as the simple action of\n\u0015\ni\n3\u03c0\n\u03c3 = Ad\non M2 (C) shows. In this case, the identity is the\nei 4\nonly irreducible representation\nn\no of the crossed-product M2 (C) \u22ca\u03c3 Z4 =\n3\u03c0\nM2 (C) and clearly i, ei 4 is not a coset of Z4 . Of course, this is an\nexample of a minimal representation.\nIn [4], we showed that all irreducible representations of A \u22ca\u03c3 Z2\nwhere regular or minimal. The following example shows that we can\nnot expect the same in the general case.\nExample 4.3. Let A =\u0014 M2 (C)\u0015 \u2295 M2 (C) and define \u03c3(M \u2295 N) =\n0 1\nW NW \u2217 \u2295 M with W =\n. Then \u03c3 4 = IdA and \u03c3 2 (M \u2295 N) =\n1 0\nW MW \u2217 \u2295 W NW \u2217 . Now, let \u03c0 i : M1 \u2295 M2 \u2208 A 7\u2192 Mi with i = 1, 2. Of\ncourse, \u03c0 1 , \u03c0 2 are the only two irreducible representations of A up to\nequivalence, and they are not equivalent to each other (since they have\ncomplementary kernels). Now, we consider the following representation\n\u03a0 of A \u22ca\u03c3 Z4 . It acts on C4 . We set:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c01 0\n\u03c0A =\n0 \u03c02\nand:\nU\u03a0 =\n\n\u0014\n\n0 1\nW 0\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\nFirst, observe that \u03a0 thus defined\nis\n\u0014\n\u0015 irreducible. Indeed, M commutes\n\u03bb b\nwith \u03c0 A if and only if M =\nwith \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 C and b\u03c0 2 (a) = \u03c0 1 (a)c\nc \u03bc\nwith a \u2208 A. Now, M commutes with U\u03a0 if and only if \u03bb = \u03bc and\nW b = c. Now, let a \u2208 M2 (C) be arbitrary; then b\u03c0 2 (a \u2295 W a) =\n\u03c0 1 (a \u2295 W a) c i.e.\nbW a = abW .\nHence bW is scalar. So b = \u03bbW . Thus b commutes with W . But\nthen for an arbitrary a we have b\u03c0 2 (aW \u2295 a) = \u03c0 1 (aW \u2295 a) bW i.e.\nba = aW bW = ab so b commutes with M2 (C) and thus is scalar. Hence\nb = 0. So M = \u03bb1 for \u03bb \u2208 C as needed.\nMoreover, the restriction of \u03a0 to A is \u03c0 A = \u03c0 1 \u2295 \u03c0 2 . Thus, \u03c0 A\nis\n\u001a reducible. Now,\n\u0014 the \u0015fixed point\u001b C*-algebra A1 is the C*-algebra\na b\nM \u2295M :M =\n; a, b \u2208 C . Thus, A1 has two irreducible\nb a\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n27\n\nrepresentations which are not equivalent:\n\u0014\n\u0015\na b\n\u03c61 :\n\u2208 A1 \u2192\n7 a+b\nb a\nand\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\na b\n\u03c62 :\n\u2208 A1 7\u2192 a \u2212 b.\nb a\nWe note that for i = 1, 2 we have \u03c0 i restricted to A1 is \u03c61 \u2295 \u03c62 .\n\nNow, using the notations of Example (4.3), \u03a0 is not regular, since\nthe restriction of any irreducible regular representation to the fixed\npoint algebra A1 is given by the sum of several copies of the same\nirreducible representation of A1 . Trivially, \u03a0 is not minimal either\nsince \u03a0|A = \u03c0 1 \u2295 \u03c0 2 . However, both \u03c0 1 and \u03c0 2 are minimal for the\naction of \u03c3 2 . Moreover, both \u03c0 1 and \u03c02 restricted to A1 are the same\nrepresentation \u03b11 \u2295\u03b12 . We shall see in the next section that this pattern\nis in fact general.\n4.2. Characterization of Irreducible Representations. We now\npresent the main result of this paper concerning crossed products by\nfinite cyclic groups. In this context, one can go further than Theorem\n(3.4) to obtain a characterization of irreducible representations of the\ncrossed-products in term of the C*-algebras A and A1 . The next lemma\nis the sufficient condition for this characterization.\nLemma 4.4. Let \u03c0 1 be an irreducible representation of A acting on a\nHilbert space J .

Since T \u03c0A (a) = \u03c0 A (a)T for all a \u2208 A, we\nconclude that \u03c0 i (a)Tij = Tij \u03c0 j (a). By Lemma (2.3), since \u03c0 i and \u03c0 j\nare irreducible and not unitarily equivalent, we conclude that Tij = 0.\nMoreover, Tii commutes with \u03c0 i which is irreducible, so we conclude\nthat:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03bb1\n..\n\uf8fb\nT =\uf8f0\n.\n\u03bbm\nfor \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm \u2208 C.

Hence \u03a0 is irreducible.\n\u0003\n\nWe now are ready to describe in detail the structure of irreducible\nrepresentations of crossed-products by finite cyclic groups in terms of\nirreducible representations of A and A1 .\nTheorem 4.5.

In other words, we replace \u03a0 by Ad \u03a5\u25e6\n\u03a0 and we shall use the notations introduced to study \u03a0 henceforth, with\nthe understanding that for all j = 0, . . . , m \u2212 1 and k = 1, . . . , r we\nhave that \u03c0 rj+k = \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03c3 j , that Jj is an isometric copy of J0 and that\nH = J0 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Jm\u22121 with Jj = Hrj+1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Hr(j+1) where \u03c0 rj+k acts\non Hrj+k which is an isometric copy of H1 . Moreover, U\u03a0 is given by\nEquality (4.3) for some unitary V of J0 .\nWe are left to show that each irreducible subrepresentation of \u03c0 A is\nof multiplicity one, i.e. r = 1. We recall that we have shown above\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n31\n\nthat H = (mZ) /nZ with n = mk and k \u2208 N. Using the notations\nof Theorem (3.4), the representation \u03a8 defined by \u03a8(a) = \u03c0(a) for all\na \u2208 A and \u03a8(U m ) = V is an irreducible representation of A\u22ca\u03b1 H. Now\nA \u22ca\u03b1 H is *-isomorphic to A \u22ca\u03b1m Zk by universality of the C*-crossedproduct, and we now identify these two C*-algebras. The image of\nU m \u2208 A \u22ca\u03b1 H in the crossed-product A \u22ca\u03b1m Zk is denoted by \u03c5 and\nis the canonical unitary of A \u22ca\u03b1m Zk . Thus by Theorem (3.4) \u03a8 is\nan irreducible representation of A \u22ca\u03b1m Zk which (up to conjugacy)\nacts on the space Cr \u2297 H1 and is of the form \u03a8(a) = 1Cr \u2297 \u03c0 1 (a) for\na \u2208 A and \u03a8(\u03c5 z ) = \u03a9(z) \u2297 W (z) for z \u2208 Zk where \u03a9 and W are\nsome unitary projective representations of Zk on Cr and H1 respectively, with \u03a9 being irreducible. Since Zk is cyclic, the range of the\nprojective representation \u03a9 is contained in the C*-algebra C \u2217 (\u03a9(1))\nwhich is Abelian since \u03a9(1) is a unitary. Hence, since \u03a9 is irreducible,\nC \u2217 (\u03a9(1)) is an irreducible Abelian C*-algebra of operators acting on\nCr . Hence r = 1 and J = H1 . Moreover, since U\u03a0m = V \u2295 . . . \u2295 V then\nU\u03a0n = V k \u2295 . . . \u2295 V k = 1H and thus V k = 1J . Therefore, (2) holds as\nclaimed.\nLast, we also observed that V \u03c01 V = \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03c3 k by construction (since\nk\nU\u03a0 = V \u2295 . . . \u2295 V ). Hence by definition, since \u03c0 1 is irreducible, the\nrepresentation \u03c8 of A \u22ca\u03c3k Z\u03bc defined by \u03c8(a) = \u03c0 1 (a) for a \u2208 A and\n\u03c8(U) = V is minimal. Hence, by Theorem (4.2), the restriction of\n\u03c0 1 to the fixed point C*-algebra A1 is the direct sum of \u03b7 irreducible\nrepresentations \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6\u03b7 of A1 such that \u03c6i and \u03c6j are not unitarily equivalent for i 6= j \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03b7}, where \u03b7 is the cardinal of the\nspectrum of V . Moreover, since \u03c0 i = \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03c3 i it is immediate that\n\u03c0 i restricted to A1 equals to \u03c0 1 restricted to A1 . This concludes our\nproof.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.6.

The\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(1) Up to unitary equivalence, \u03a0 is an irreducible regular representation of A \u22ca\u03c3 Zn , i.e. it is induced by a unique irreducible\nrepresentation \u03c0 of A and:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n0 1\n.\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n0 ..\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nU\u03a0 = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n.\n.. 1 \uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n1\n0\n\nn\u22121\nwhile \u03c0 A = \u2295i=0\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3 i and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3 i is not equivalent to \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3 j for\ni, j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 with i 6= j,\n\n\f32\n\nALVARO ARIAS AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC LATR\u00c9MOLI\u00c8RE\n\n(2) There exists an irreducible subrepresentation \u03c0 of \u03a0|A such that\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3 i is not equivalent to \u03c0 for i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n(3) There exists a unique irreducible representation \u03c6 of A1 such\nthat \u03a0|A1 is equivalent to n * \u03c6,\n(4) There is no k \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} such that the C*-algebra generated by \u03a0(A) and U\u03a0k is reducible.\nProof. It is a direct application of Theorem (4.5).\n\n\u0003\n\nWe thus have concluded that all irreducible representations of crossed\nproducts by finite cyclic groups have a structure which is a composite of the two cases found in [4]. Indeed, such representations cycle\nthrough a collection of minimal representations, which all share the\nsame restriction to the fixed point algebra. The later is a finite sum of\nirreducible mutually disjoint representations of the fixed point algebra.\nRemark 4.7. Let \u03c3 be an order n automorphism of a unital C*-algebra\nA and let \u03a0 be an irreducible representation of A \u22ca\u03c3 Z. We recall [12]\nthat A \u22ca\u03c3 Z is generated by A and a unitary U such that UaU \u2217 = \u03c3(a)\nfor all a \u2208 A and is universal for these commutation relations. We\ndenote \u03a0(U) by U\u03a0 and \u03a0(a) by \u03c0(a) for all a \u2208 A. Now, note that U\u03a0n\ncommutes with \u03c0 since \u03c3 n = IdA and of course U\u03a0n commutes with U\u03a0\nso, since \u03a0 is irreducible, there exists \u03bb \u2208 T such that U\u03a0n = \u03bb. Now,\ndefine V\u03a0 = \u03bcU\u03a0 for any \u03bc \u2208 T such that \u03bcn = \u03bb. Then V\u03a0n = 1 and\nthus (\u03c0, V\u03a0 ) is an irreducible representation of A \u22ca\u03c3 Zn which is then\nfully described by Theorem (4.5).\nIn the last section of this paper, we give a necessary condition on\nirreducible representations of crossed-products by the group S3 of permutations of {1, 2, 3}. This last example illustrates some of the behavior which distinguish the conclusion of Theorem (3.4) from the one of\nTheorem (4.5).\n5. Application: Crossed-Products by the permutation\ngroup on {1, 2, 3}\nAs an application, we derive the structure of the irreducible representations of crossed-products by the group S3 of permutations of\n{1, 2, 3}. This group is isomorphic to Z3 \u22ca\u03b3 Z2 where \u03b3 is defined as\nfollows: if \u03b7 and \u03c4 are the respective images of 1 \u2208 Z in the groups Z3\nand Z2 then the action \u03b3 of Z2 on Z3 is given by \u03b3 \u03c4 (\u03b7) = \u03b72 . Thus in\nZ3 \u22ca\u03b3 Z2 we have \u03c4 \u03b7\u03c4 = \u03b7 2 , \u03c4 2 = 1 and \u03b7 3 = 1 (using the multiplicative\nnotation for the group law). An isomorphism between S3 and Z3 \u22ca\u03b3 Z2\nis given by sending the transposition (1 2) to \u03c4 and the 3-cycle (1 2 3)\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n33\n\nto \u03b7. From now on we shall identify these two groups implicitly using\nthis isomorphism.\nTheorem 5.1. Let \u03b1 be an action of S3 on A. Let \u03a0 be an irreducible\nrepresentation of A\u22ca\u03b1 S3 . We denote by \u03c4 and \u03b7 the permutations (1 2)\nand (1 2 3). The set {\u03c4 , \u03b7} is a generator set of S3 . We denote by U\u03c4\nand U\u03b7 the canonical unitaries in A \u22ca\u03b1 S3 corresponding respectively\nto \u03c4 and \u03b7. Then either (up to a unitary conjugation of \u03a0):\n\u2022 \u03a0 is minimal, i.e. \u03a0|A is irreducible,\n\u2022 There exists an irreducible representation \u03c0 1 on H1 of A such\nthat H \u0015= H1 \u2295 H1 with \u03c0 A = \u03c0 1 \u2295 \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 .

Moreover, \u03c0 1 and \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 are minimal for\nthe action of \u03b7.\n\u2022 There exists an irreducible representation \u03c0 1 on H1 of A such\nthat \u03c01 and \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b7i are non equivalent for i = 1, 2 and such\nthat H = \uf8eeH1 \u2295 H1 \u2295\uf8f9H1 with \u03c0 A = \u03c0 1 \u2295 \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b7 \u2295 \u03c0 1 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b72 .

There exists a nontrivial irreducible representation \u03c0 :\nC \u2217 (F3 ) \u2192 M2 (C) such that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 are unitarily equivalent, but\n\u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b7 are not. Indeed, set:\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n0 1\n.\n\u03c0 (U3 ) =\n\u03c0 (U2 ) =\n\u03c0 (U1 ) =\n0 \u22121\n\u22121 0\n1 0\nWe check easily that \u03c0 is an irreducible \u2217-representation. Since\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 0\n1 0\n[\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 ]\n= \u03c0,\n0 \u22121\n0 \u22121\n\u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 are unitarily equivalent. To see that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b7 are not\nunitarily equivalent, notice that \u03c0 (U1 U2 \u2212 U2 U1 ) = 0 but that:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 2\n\u03c0 (U2 U3 \u2212 U3 U2 ) =\n.\n\u22122 0\n\nExample 5.3. There exists a non trivial irreducible representation \u03c0 :\nC \u2217 (F3 ) \u2192 M3 (C) such that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 are unitarily equivalent\nand\n\u0001\n\u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b7 are also unitarily equivalent. Let \u03bb = exp 13 2i\u03c0 .

We check that V \u03c0 (Ui ) V = \u03c0 U(i+1) mod 3 . Then\n0 \u03bb\nlet W = \u03c0(U3 ). Then W \u03c0 (U1 ) W \u2217 = \u03c0 (U2 ), W \u03c0 (U2 ) W \u2217 = \u03c0 (U1 ),\nand W \u03c0 (U3 ) W \u2217 = \u03c0 (U3 ). Thus \u03c0 is a minimal representation of\nC \u2217 (F3 ) for the action \u03b1 of S3 .\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n37\n\nExample 5.4. There exists an irreducible representation \u03c0 : C \u2217 (F3 ) \u2192\nM3 (C) such that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u0001\u03b1\u03b7 are unitarily equivalent, but \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4\nare not: Let \u03bb = exp 31 2\u03c0i and define unitaries T and V by\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ee\n1 0 0\n0 \u2212 45 \u2212 53\n9\n12 \uf8fb\nand V = \uf8f00 \u03bb 0 \uf8fb\nT = \uf8f0 45 \u2212 25\n25\n12\n16\n3\n\u2212 25\n0 0 \u03bb2\n5\n25\nDefine\n\n\u03c0 (U1 ) = V T V 2\n\n\u03c0 (U2 ) = V 2 T V\n\n\u03c0 (U3 ) = T .\n\nIt is clear that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b7 are unitarily equivalent. We will show\nthat \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 are not unitarily equivalent. Suppose on the contrary\nthat they are.

Similarly we get the other two.\nSince \u03c0 is irreducible we conclude that there exists a constant c such\nthat\nV W V = cW.\nV has a precise form and when we compute V W V \u2212 cW we conclude\nthat this equation has a non zero solution iff c = 1, c = \u03bb, or c = \u03bb2 .\n\n\f38\n\nALVARO ARIAS AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC LATR\u00c9MOLI\u00c8RE\n\nMoreover, the solutions have the\n\uf8ee\nx\nW = \uf8f00\n0\n\uf8ee\n0\nW = \uf8f0y\n0\n\uf8ee\n0\nW = \uf8f00\nz\n\nform:\n\uf8f9\n0 0\n0 y \uf8fb if c = 1\nz 0\n\uf8f9\nx 0\n0 0\uf8fb if c = \u03bb\n0 z\n\uf8f9\n0 x\ny 0 \uf8fb if c = \u03bb2\n0 0\n\nfor some x, y, c \u2208 C.\nNow we easily check that T does not commute with any of the three\nW 's.

This example acts on A = C (T3 ). Define for f \u2208\nC(T3 ) and (z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2208 T3 :\n\u03b1\u03b7 (f ) (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = f (z2 , z3 , z1 )\nand\n\u03b1\u03c4 (f ) (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = f (z2 , z1 , z3 )\non C (T ). We can build a non trivial irreducible representation \u03c0 :\nC (T3 ) \u2192 C such that \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03b7 are not unitarily equivalent and \u03c0\nand \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b1\u03c4 are also not unitarily equivalent. Let x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2208 T3 be\nsuch that x1 6= x2 , x2 6= x3 , and x3 6= x1 .Define \u03c0(f ) = f (x). Then we\nobtain an irreducible representation of the required type as the regular\nrepresentation induced by \u03c0, using Theorem (2.4).\n3\n\nNow, Theorem (3.4) allowed for the irreducible subrepresentations\nof \u03a0|A to have multiplicity greater than one, for irreducible representations \u03a0 of A \u22ca\u03b1 G. This situation is however prohibited when G is\nfinite cyclic by Theorem (4.5). We show that finite polycyclic groups\nsuch as S3 can provide examples where \u03a0|A may not be multiplicity\n\n\fFINITE GROUP CROSSED-PRODUCTS\n\n39\n\nfree, thus showing again that Theorem (3.4) can not be strengthened\nto the conclusion of Theorem (4.5).\nExample 5.6. We shall use the notations of Theorem (5.1).

Note that \u03c0 is thus minimal for the action of \u03b1\u03b7 .\nIndeed, let us start with any unital C*-algebra A for which there exists\nan action \u03b1 of S3 and an irreducible representation \u03a0 : A \u22ca\u03b1 S3 \u2192\nB (H) such that \u03c0 = \u03a0|A is also irreducible, i.e. \u03a0 is minimal. For\ninstance, Example (5.3) provides such a situation. Let V\u03b7 = \u03a0 (U\u03b7 )\nand V\u03c4 = \u03a0(U\u03c4 ).
