We find long-lasting outflows in both\ncases. (1) In the case of slowly rotating stars, a new type of outflow, a conical wind, is\nfound and studied in simulations. The conical winds appear in cases where the magnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the disk into an X-type configuration. The winds\nhave the shape of a thin conical shell with a half-opening angle \u03b8 \u223c 30\u25e6 \u2212 40\u25e6 . About\n10 \u2212 30% of the disk matter flows from the inner disk into the conical winds. The\nconical winds may be responsible for episodic as well as long-lasting outflows in different types of stars. (2) In the case of rapidly rotating stars (the \"propeller regime\"),\na two-component outflow is observed. One component is similar to the conical winds.\nA significant fraction of the disk matter may be ejected into the winds. A second component is a high-velocity, low-density magnetically dominated axial jet where matter\nflows along the opened polar field lines of the star. The jet has a mass flux about 10%\nthat of the conical wind, but its energy flux (dominantly magnetic) can be larger than\nthe energy flux of the conical wind. The jet's angular momentum flux (also dominantly\nmagnetic) causes the star to spin-down rapidly. Propeller-driven outflows may be responsible for the jets in protostars and for their rapid spin-down. The jet is collimated\nby the magnetic force while the conical winds are only weakly collimated in the simulation region. Exploratory 3D simulations show that conical winds are axisymmetric\nabout the rotational axis (of the star and the disk), even when the dipole field of the\nstar is significantly misaligned.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs; MHD; stars: magnetic fields\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOutflows or jets are observed from many disk accreting objects ranging from young stars to systems with white dwarfs,\nneutron stars, and black holes (e.g., Livio 1997).\nA large body of observations exists for outflows from\nyoung stars at different stages of their evolution, ranging\nfrom protostars, where powerful collimated outflows are observed, to classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs), where the outflows\nare weaker and often less collimated (see review by Ray et\n?\n\nE-mail: romanova@astro.cornell.edu\n\u2020 E-mail: ustyugg@rambler.ru\n\u2021 E-mail: koldoba@rambler.ru\n\u00a7 E-mail:lovelace@astro.cornell.edu\n\nal. 2007). Correlation between the disk and jet power had\nbeen found in many CTTSs (e.g., Cabrit et al. 1990; Hartigan, Edwards & Gandhour 1995). A significant number of\nCTTSs show signs of outflows in spectral lines, in particular\nin He I where two distinct components of outflows had been\nfound (Edwards et al. 2003, 2006; Kwan, Edwards, & Fischer 2007). Outflows are also observed from accreting compact stars such as accreting white dwarfs in symbiotic binaries\n(e.g., Sokoloski & Kenyon 2003), or from the vicinity of neutron stars, such as from Circinus X-1 (Heinz et al. 2007).\nDifferent theoretical models have been proposed to explain the outflows from protostars and CTTSs (see review by\nFerreira, Dougados, & Cabrit 2006). The models include those\nwhere the outflow originates from a radially distributed disk\n\n\f2\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nFigure 1. Two-component outflows observed in slowly (left) and rapidly (right) rotating magnetized stars for the reference runs described in this\npaper. The background shows the poloidal matter flux Fm = \u03c1vp , the arrows are the poloidal velocity vectors, and the lines are sample magnetic\nfield lines. The labels point to the main outflow components.\n\nwind (K\u00f6nigl & Pudritz 2000; Casse & Keppens 2004; Ferreira\net al. 2006) or from the innermost region of the accretion\ndisk (Lovelace, Berk & Contopoulos 1991). Further, there is\nthe X-wind model (Shu et al. 1994; 2007; Najita & Shu 1994;\nCai et al. 2008) where most of the outflow originates from\nthe disk-magnetosphere boundary. The maximum velocities\nin the outflows are usually of the order of the Keplerian velocity of the inner region of the disk (or higher). This favors\nthe models where the outflows originate from the inner disk\nregion, or from the disk-magnetosphere boundary (if the star\nhas a dynamically important magnetic field).\nOutflows from the disk-magnetosphere boundary were\ninvestigated in early simulations by Hayashi, Shibata & Matsumoto (1996) and Miller & Stone (1997). A one-time\nepisode of outflows from the inner disk and inflation of the\ninnermost field lines connecting the star and the disk were observed for a few dynamical time-scales. Somewhat longer simulation runs were performed by Goodson et al. (1997, 1999),\nHirose et al. (1997), Matt et al. (2002) and K\u00fcker, Henning\n& R\u00fcdiger (2003) where several episodes of field inflation\nand outflows were observed. These simulations hinted at a\npossible long-term nature for the outflows. However, the simulations were not sufficiently long to establish the behavior\nof the outflows. Much longer simulation runs were obtained\nby treating the disk as a boundary condition (e.g. Fendt & Elsner 1999, 2000; Matsakos et al. 2008; Fendt 2009; see also\nvon Rekowski & Brandenburg 2004; Yelenina, Ustyugova &\nKoldoba 2006). These simulations help understand, for example, the roles of the disk wind and stellar wind components\nin the outflow and collimation. However, for understanding\nthe launching mechanisms it is important to have a realistic,\nlow-temperature disk and to solve the full MHD equations in\nall of the disk and coronal space.\nThe goal of this work is to obtain long-lasting (robust)\noutflows from a realistic low-temperature disk (not a boundary condition) into a high-temperature, low-density corona.\nWe obtained such outflows in two main cases: (1) when the\nstar rotates slowly but the field lines are bunched up into an\nX-type configuration, and (2) when the star rotates rapidly,\nin the propeller regime (e.g., Illarionov & Sunyaev 1975; Alpar & Shaham 1985; Lovelace, Romanova & Bisnovatyi-Kogan\n1999) and the condition for bunching is also satisfied. In\nboth cases, two-component outflows have been observed (see\nFig. 1). One component originates at the inner edge of the\ndisk and has a narrow-shell conical shape, and therefore we\n\ncall it a \"conical wind\". The other component is a magnetically (or centrifugally) driven high-velocity low-density wind\nwhich flows along stellar field lines. We call it a \"jet\". The jet\nmay be very powerful in the propeller regime. Below we discuss both regimes in detail (see \u00a73 -\u00a74) after description of\nthe numerical approach (see \u00a72). In \u00a75 we discuss different\nproperties of outflows. In \u00a76 we present exploratory 3D simulations of conical winds, and in \u00a77 we compare conical winds\nand propeller outflows with the X-wind model. In \u00a78 we apply the model to different types of stars, and in \u00a79 we present\nour conclusions. Appendixes A and B clarify different aspects\nof the numerical model. Appendix C summarizes results of different runs for a variety of parameters.\n\n2\n\nNUMERICAL MODEL\n\nWe simulate the outflows resulting from disk-magnetosphere\ninteraction using the equations of axisymmetric MHD described below. Axisymmetric simulations of the outflows are\nsimilar to those performed earlier for the propeller regime\n(e.g., U06), but differ in initial and boundary conditions. Below we give an outline of the numerical model.\n2.1\n\nBasic Equations\n\nOutside of the disk the flow is described by the equations of\nideal MHD. Inside the disk the flow is described by the equations of viscous, resistive MHD. In an inertial reference frame\nthe equations are:\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1v) = 0 ,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202(\u03c1v)\n+\u2207*T =\u03c1g,\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\n\u2202B\n\u2212 \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 B) + \u2207 \u00d7 (\u03b7t \u2207 \u00d7 B) = 0 ,\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202(\u03c1S)\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1Sv) = Q .\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nHere, \u03c1 is the density and S is the specific entropy; v is the\nflow velocity; B is the magnetic field; T is the momentum\nflux-density tensor; Q is the rate of change of entropy per\nunit volume; and g = \u2212(GM/r2 )r\u0302 is the gravitational acceleration due to the star, which has mass M . The total mass of\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Conical winds at different times T . The background shows the poloidal matter flux \u03c1vp (with the scale below the plots), the arrows\nare the poloidal velocity vectors, and the lines are sample magnetic field lines (same set in all frames). Time T is measured in Keplerian rotation\nperiods at r = 1. For example, for CTTS T0 = 1.04 days (see Table 1) and time T = 700 corresponds to 2 years. The sample vector vp = 1\ncorresponds to v0 = 195 km/s.\n\nFigure 3. The poloidal matter flux \u03c1vp (with the scale on the right-hand side), sample magnetic field lines, and velocity vectors in the conical\nwind at time T = 500. Sample numbers are given for the dimensionless poloidal vp and total vt velocities, and for the density \u03c1. To obtain\nthe dimensional values one needs to multiply these numbers by the reference values given in the Table 1. For example, for application to CTTS:\nvp = 1 corresponds to v0 = 195 km/s, \u03c1 = 1 corresponds to \u03c10 = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u221213 g cm\u22123 , and the distance r = 1 corresponds to R0 = 0.02 AU.\n\nthe disk is negligible compared to M . The plasma is considered to be an ideal gas with adiabatic index \u03b3 = 5/3, and\nS = ln(p/\u03c1\u03b3 ). We use spherical coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) with \u03b8\nmeasured from the symmetry axis. The condition for axisymmetry is \u2202/\u2202\u03c6 = 0. The equations in spherical coordinates are\ngiven in U06.\nThe stress tensor T and the treatment of viscosity and\ndiffusivity are described in Appendix A. Briefly, both the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity of the disk plasma are considered to be due to turbulent fluctuations of the velocity and\n\nthe magnetic field. We adopt the standard hypothesis where\nthe molecular transport coefficients are replaced by turbulent\ncoefficients. To estimate the values of these coefficients, we\nuse the \u03b1-model of Shakura and Sunyaev (1973) where the\ncoefficient of the turbulent kinematic viscosity \u03bdt = \u03b1v c2s /\u03a9K ,\nwhere cs is the isothermal sound speed and \u03a9K (r) is the Keplerian angular velocity. Similarly, the coefficient of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity \u03b7t = \u03b1d c2s /\u03a9K . Here, \u03b1v and \u03b1d are\ndimensionless coefficients which are treated as parameters of\nthe model.\n\n\f4\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nFigure 5. The background shows different parameters of a conical wind at time T = 500, in the full simulation region, panels a-d, and near\nthe star, panels e-h. The background shows (from left to right): the poloidal matter flux, Fm = \u03c1vp , the angular velocity \u03a9, the poloidal current\nJp = rB\u03c6 , and the entropy S. Lines are sample magnetic field lines. Vectors are velocity vectors. The thick red line and the marks A, B, C show\none of the field lines and positions along this line which are used for analysis of the forces and velocities in Fig. 6. The white vector in panel g\nshows schematically the direction of the magnetic force, M.\n\ndimensionless MHD equations have the same form as the dimensional ones, equations (1)-(4) (for such dimensionalization we put GM = 1 and R = 1). Table 1 shows examples of reference variables for different stars. We solve the\nMHD equations (1)-(4) using normalized variables: \u03c1\u0303 = \u03c1/\u03c10 ,\n\u1e7d = v/v0 , B\u0303 = B/B0 , etc. Most of the plots show the normalized variables (with the tildes implicit). To obtain dimensional\nvalues one needs to multiply values from the plots by the corresponding reference values from Table 1.\nFigure 4.

We take the reference mass M0 to be the mass M\nof the star. The reference radius is taken to be twice the radius of the star, R0 = 2R\u2217 . The surface magnetic field B\u2217 is\ndifferent for different types of stars. The reference velocity is\nv0 = (GM/R0 )1/2 . The reference time-scale t0 = R0 /v0 , and\nthe reference angular velocity \u03a90 = 1/t0 . We measure time in\nunits of P0 = 2\u03c0t0 (which is the Keplerian rotation period at\nr = R0 ). In the plots we use the dimensionless time T = t/P0 .\nThe reference magnetic field is B0 = B\u2217 (R\u2217 /R0 )3 /\u03bc\u0303, where\n\u03bc\u0303 is the dimensionless magnetic moment. The reference density is taken to be \u03c10 = B02 /v02 . The reference pressure is\np0 = B02 . The reference temperature is T0 = p0 /R\u03c10 = v02 /R,\nwhere R is the gas constant. The reference accretion rate is\n\u1e400 = \u03c10 v0 R02 . The reference energy flux is \u01160 = \u1e400 v02 . The\nreference angular momentum flux is L\u03070 = \u1e400 v0 R0 .\nThe reference units are defined in such a way that the\n\n2.3\n\nInitial and Boundary Conditions\n\nWe assume that the poloidal magnetic field of the star is an\naligned dipole field B = [3(\u03bc * r)r \u2212 \u03bcr2 ]/r5 , where \u03bc is\nthe star's magnetic moment. The initial density and temperature distributions are different in cases of conical winds and\npropeller-driven winds.\n\n2.3.1\n\nConical Winds\n\nInitial Conditions. At time T = 0 the simulation region is filled\nwith a low-density, high-temperature, isothermal plasma referred to as the corona. Initially it is non-rotating. Thus the\ndensity and pressure distributions in the corona are:\n\u03c1 = \u03c1c exp[GM/(RTc r)],\n\np = pc exp[GM/(RTc r)] ,\n\nwhere Tc is the corona temperature, \u03c1c is the coronal density\nat the external boundary, pc = \u03c1c RTc .\nWe divide the external boundary Rout into a disk region, \u03b8d < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2, and a corona region, 0 < \u03b8 < \u03b8d ,\nwith \u03b8d \u2248 65\u25e6 .

Reference values for different types of stars. We choose the mass M , radius R\u2217 , equatorial magnetic field B\u2217 and the period P\u2217 of the\nstar and derive the other reference values (see \u00a72.2). To apply the simulation results to a particular star one needs to multiply the dimensionless\nvalues from the plots by the reference values from this table.\n\nthe disk boundary region, \u03b8 > \u03b8d , with a fixed density \u03c1 = \u03c1d .\nMatter continues to flow inward due to viscosity (see Appendix A). We increase the spin of the star gradually from\na small value corresponding to rcor = Rout (where rcor =\n(GM/\u03a92 )1/3 ) up to a final value \u03a9\u2217 . Information about the\nstellar rotation propagates rapidly (at the Alfv\u00e9n speed) into\nthe low-density corona.\n\ntion region through the boundary. The inflowing matter has a\nfixed magnetic flux which is very small because Rout \u001d Rin .\nThe boundary conditions on the equatorial plane and on\nthe rotation axis are symmetric and antisymmetric.\n\nWe did simulations for a variety of parameters. However,\nwe take one case with typical parameters to be our reference case and show the results for this case. In the reference\ncase, the dipole moment of the star \u03bc = 10; the density in\nthe corona \u03c1c = 0.001, the density in the disk \u03c1d = 10;\nthe corona is hot with temperature Tc = 1; the disk is cold\nwith temperature Td = (\u03c1c /\u03c1d )Tc = 10\u22124 . The angular velocity of the star corresponds to a corotation radius rcor = 3,\n3\n\u03a9\u2217 = (GM/rcor\n) = 0.19. The coefficients of viscosity and diffusivity are \u03b1v = 0.3 and \u03b1d = 0.1. The dependences of our\nresults on different parameters are discussed in Appendix C.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions for the propeller regime\nare the same as those used in R05 and U06. Here, we summarize these conditions.\nInitial Conditions. We place both the disk and the corona\ninto the simulation region. We assume that the initial flow is\nbarotropic with \u03c1 = \u03c1(p), and that there is no pressure jump\nat the boundary between the disk and corona. Then the initial\ndensity distribution (in dimensionless units) is the following:\n8\n< p/RTd , p > pb and r sin \u03b8 \u2265 rb ,\n\u03c1(p) =\n: p/RT , p < p\nor\nr sin \u03b8 \u2264 rb ,\nc\nb\n\nThe boundary conditions at the inner boundary r = Rin\nare the following: The frozen-in condition is applied to the\npoloidal component Bp of the field, such that Br is fixed\nwhile B\u03b8 and B\u03c6 obey \"free\" boundary conditions, \u2202B\u03b8 /\u2202r =\n0 and \u2202B\u03c6 /\u2202r = 0. The density, pressure, and entropy also\nhave free boundary conditions, \u2202(...)/\u2202r = 0. The velocity\ncomponents are calculated using free boundary conditions.\nThen, the velocity vector is adjusted to be parallel to the magnetic field vector in the coordinate system rotating with a star.\nMatter always flows inward at the star's surface. Outflow to a\nstellar wind is not considered in this work.\n\nwhere pb is the pressure on the surface which separates the\ncold matter of the disk from the hot matter of the corona.\nOn this surface the density jumps from pb /Td to pb /Tc . Here\nrb is the inner disk radius. Because the density distribution is\nbarotropic, the angular velocity is constant on coaxial cylindrical surfaces about the z\u2212axis. Consequently, the pressure\ndistribution may be determined from the Bernoulli equation,\n\nThe boundary conditions at the external boundary r =\nRout in the coronal region 0 < \u03b8 < \u03b8d are free for all hydrodynamic variables. However, we prevent matter from flowing\ninto the simulation region from this part of the boundary. We\nsolve the transport equation for the flux function \u03a8 so that the\nmagnetic flux flows out of the region together with matter. If\nthe matter has a tendency to flow back in, then we fix \u03a8. In\nthe disk region, \u03b8d < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2, we fix the density at \u03c1 = \u03c1d ,\nand establish a slightly sub-Keplerian velocity, \u03a9d = \u03ba\u03a9(rd ),\nwhere \u03ba = 1 \u2212 0.003 so that matter flows into the simula-\n\n2.3.2\n\nPropeller Regime\n\nF (p) + \u03a6 + \u03a6c = E = const .\n\u03a6 = \u2212GM/|r| is gravitational potential, \u03a6c =\nRHere,\n\u221e\n2\n\u03a9\n(\u03be)\u03bed\u03be is centrifugal potential, which depends only\nr sin \u03b8\non the cylindrical radius r sin \u03b8, and\n8\n< RTd ln(p/pb ) , p > pb and r sin \u03b8 > rb ,\nF (p) =\n: RT ln(p/p ) , p < p\nor r sin \u03b8 < rb .\nc\nb\nb\nThe angular velocity of the disk is slightly sub-Keplerian,\n\u03a9(\u03b8 = \u03c0/2) = \u03ba\u03a9K (\u03ba = 1 \u2212 0.003), due to which the\ndensity and pressure decrease towards the periphery.

Panel b: Same but for a more rapidly rotating star (rcor = 2).\nBoth cases are shown at time T = 250.\n\nchange the angular velocity of the star from its initial value\n\u03a9(rb ) = 5\u22123/2 \u2248 0.09 (rb = 5) to a final value of \u03a9\u2217 = 1 over\nthe course of three Keplerian rotation periods at r = 1.\nFor the propeller regime we use a slightly different set\nof parameters compared with the conical wind case (in order\nto be consistent with our earlier simulations in R05, U06).\nBelow we describe the similarities and differences: the dipole\nmoment of the star is the same, \u03bc = 10. The angular velocity\nof the star in the propeller regime is larger, \u03a9\u2217 = 1. The initial\ndensity in the disk (at the inner edge) is \u03c1d = 1, which is\nsmaller than the external density (\u03c1d = 10) in conical winds.\nThe initial temperatures are a factor of two smaller than in\nconical winds, Tc = (p/R\u03c1)c = 0.5, Td = 0.0005.\nBoundary conditions for the propeller regime are similar to\nthose for conical winds with the following differences. At the\nexternal boundary (disk region) we take free conditions for\nall variables. There is no condition of fixed density at the disk\npart of the boundary.\nThe system of MHD equations (1-4) was integrated numerically using the Godunov-type numerical scheme (see Appendix B). The simulations were done in the region Rin \u2264\n\nr \u2264 Rout , 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2. The grid is uniform in the \u03b8direction. The size steps in the radial direction were chosen\nso that the poloidal-plane cells were curvilinear rectangles\nwith approximately equal sides. A typical region for investigation of conical winds was 1 \u2264 r \u2264 16, with grid resolution\nNr \u00d7 N\u03b8 = 51 \u00d7 31 cells. A typical region for investigation\nof the propeller regime was 1 \u2264 r \u2264 48 with grid resolution\nNr \u00d7 N\u03b8 = 85 \u00d7 31 cells. Test simulations at angular grids\nN\u03b8 = 51 and N\u03b8 = 71 were also performed. Each simulation\nrun at the lowest resolution takes about two months of computing time on a single processor. We performed 40 different\nsimulation runs for different parameters on our local cluster\nof 20 computers for the investigation of conical winds. 3D\nsimulation runs were performed with \"Cubed sphere\" parallel\ncode on NASA high-performance facilities.\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n\n7\n\nFigure 8.

Same as in Fig. 3 but for the propeller regime at time T = 1400.\n\n3\n\n3.1\n\nMATTER FLOW IN CONICAL WINDS AND IN THE\nPROPELLER REGIME\nMatter flow, velocities, and forces in conical winds\n\nA large number of simulations were done in order to understand the origin and nature of conical winds. All of the key\nparameters were varied in order to ensure that there is no special dependence on any parameter (see Appendix C). We observed that the formation of conical winds is a common phenomenon for a wide range of parameters. They are most persistent and strong in cases where the viscosity and diffusivity\ncoefficients are not very small, \u03b1v & 0.03, \u03b1d & 0.03. Another\nimportant condition is that \u03b1v & \u03b1d ; that is, the magnetic\nPrandtl number of the turbulence, Prm = \u03b1v /\u03b1d & 1. This\ncondition favors the bunching of the stellar magnetic field by\nthe accretion flow.\n\nFor a discussion of the physics of conical winds we focus\non one set of parameters which serves as a reference case.\nThese parameters are: \u03b1v = 0.3 and \u03b1d = 0.1; \u03a9\u2217 = 0.19\n(rcor = 3), \u03bc = 10, \u03c1d = 10, and \u03c1c = 10\u22123 , Tc = 1,\nTd = 10\u22124 . The simulations were done in dimensionless form\nand can be applied to different stars (see Table 1). However, for illustration we often show dimensional examples for\nCTTSs with parameters taken from Table 1. For example, in\napplication to CTTSs, \u03a9\u2217 = 0.19 corresponds to P\u2217 = 5.4\ndays and the unit of time used in the figures is P0 = 1.04 days\n(see Table 1 for other reference values).\nFig. 2 shows snapshots of simulations at different times\nT . One can see that the cold dense disk matter enters the\nsimulation region from the external boundary and moves inward towards the star on the viscous time-scale. The accretion flow bunches up the field lines of the dipole field to a\n\n\f8\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nFigure 10. Same as in Fig. 4 but in the propeller regime.\n\nrelatively small region near the star. All field lines shown at\nT = 0 are bunched up close to the star by T = 100. The\ninclined configuration of the resulting poloidal field and inflation of external field lines create conditions favorable for\nmatter outflow from the inner disk. The outflow starts at\nT \u223c 120 and gets stronger later. Matter flows from the inner disk into hollow, conical shaped winds with half-opening\nangle \u03b8 \u223c 30\u25e6 \u2212 40\u25e6 . The conical winds are non-stationary,\nshowing variations associated with events of inflation and\nreconnection of the magnetic field lines (see animations at\nhttp://www.astro.cornell.edu/\u223cromanova/conical.htm). The\nsimulation runs continue for a long time, about T = 740,\nwhich is about 2 years for CTTSs. The outflows remain strong\nuntil the end of the simulation runs. It is reasonable to conclude that these accretion-driven outflows into the conical\nwinds will persist as long as matter is supplied from the disk.\nFig. 3 shows the configuration at T = 500. One can see\nthat the disk matter comes close to the star and accretes onto\nthe star through a small dense funnel. Some field lines are\nstrongly inflated, and the conical wind flows from the disk\nalong these lines. There is also a set of partially inflated field\nlines (a dead zone) where accretion does not occur (e.g., Ostriker & Shu 2005; Spruit & Taam 1990). Matter in conical\nwinds rotates with the Keplerian velocity at the base of outflow, v\u03c6 \u2248 vK . It continues to rotate rapidly in the conical\nwind at larger distances from the star. The poloidal velocity\nvp increases gradually from very small values at the beginning of the outflow, up to vp \u2248 0.5vK . The main contribution\nto the total velocity vt comes from the azimuthal component.\nThere is another, high-velocity component of the low-density\nmatter which flows along the stellar field lines. In application\nto CTTSs the velocity is > 200 km/s.\nFig. 4 shows the variation of the density and the poloidal\nmagnetic field along the equator in the inner part of the simulation region at different times T . One can see that the disk\nmatter has approximately constant density at different radii,\nbut there is a density peak closer to the star. The peak increases with time, but it does not appreciably influence the\nfluxes calculated at the surface of the star (see Fig. 14). Fig.\n4 also shows that the poloidal magnetic field of the star is\ncompressed, and the compression increases with time. Compression of the star's magnetic field by the accretion flow is\nalso assumed in the X-wind model (e.g., Najita & Shu 1994).\nTo understand the physics of conical winds in greater detail we show in Fig. 5 the distribution of different parameters\nat time T = 500. Panels b and f show that the innermost\nregion of the closed magnetosphere rotates with the angular velocity of the star (1.2 \u2264 r \u2264 1.8). At larger distances\n\n(r > 2.5), the corona above the disk rotates with the angular velocity of the disk. Strongly inclined field lines which\nstart in the disk go through regions of lower and lower angular velocity and are strongly wound up owing to the difference in the angular rotation rates along the lines. This leads\nto a strong poloidal current flow Jp \u221d rB\u03c6 above the disk\n(see panels c and g) which gives rise to the magnetic force\nFp \u223c \u2212\u2207[(rB\u03c6 )2 ]. This is the main force driving matter into\nthe conical wind. Driving of winds by the magnetic force from\nthe inner disk was proposed earlier by Lovelace et al. (1991).\nThe direction of the magnetic force is shown schematically in\nFig. 5g. It acts upwards and towards the axis, which is different from the centrifugal force. This determines three of the\nimportant properties of conical winds: (1) their small opening angle; (2) the fact that the wall of the cone is narrow,\nand (3). the gradual collimation of conical winds. If the centrifugal force were dominate (e.g. Blandford & Payne 1982)\nthen the cone would have a wider opening angle and outflow\nwould flow over a wide range of directions (as in the X-wind\nmodel of Shu et al. 1994). Panels d and h show the distribution of entropy S which shows that matter flowing from the\ndisk into the wind is cold and it is not thermally driven. To\nanalyze the forces driving matter into the conical winds we\nselect one of the field lines, s, (see red bold line in panels eh) and we project forces onto this field line. We split the line\ninto two parts (see panel a). Part AB starts from the disk and\nends at the place where the line curves towards the star; part\nBC continues from there to the surface of the star .\nFig. 6a shows the projection of all forces onto part AB\nof the field line. One can see that the main force accelerating matter into the conical wind is the magnetic force M . The\ncentrifugal (C) and gravitational (G) forces approximately\ncompensate each other and the sum C + G is negative. The\npressure gradient force P is small. The \u03b8-component of the\nmagnetic force leads to frequent forced reconnection events\nof the inflated field lines and to ejection of plasmoids into the\nconical wind. Panel b shows the projection of the forces onto\nsegment BC of the field line. One can see that it is chiefly the\ncentrifugal force which accelerates the low-density matter to\nhigh velocities in this region. Panel c shows that in the conical\nwind the poloidal velocity vp (along part AB) gradually increases and crosses the slow magnetosonic (v = vsm ), Alfv\u00e9n\n(v = vA ) and fast magnetosonic (v = vf m ) surfaces. Matter rotates rapidly, therefore the azimuthal component v\u03c6 is\nmuch larger than poloidal one, and the total velocity vt is determined by the azimuthal rotation of the flow. Panel d shows\nthat there is an interval of high velocity along the stellar part\n(BC) of the field line. Thus, we observe a two-component\nflow: (1) a high-density low-velocity conical wind which is the\nmain component of the outflows, and (2) a low-density fast\noutflow along the stellar field lines which occupies a much\nsmaller region.\nWe find that the region of the fast coronal flow increases\nin size with the star's rotation rate. As an example we decreased the corotation radius from rcor = 3 (\u03a9\u2217 = 0.19) to\nrcor = 2 (\u03a9\u2217 = 0.35) and observed that the region of fast\ncoronal flow increased significantly. Fig. 7 shows the difference. The region is even larger for smaller corotation radii\nwhen the star is closer to the propeller regime. In the propeller regime (see \u00a74) the fast jet component occupies the entire region within the conical wind and is very powerful. The\nstar spins up for both Rcor = 2 and 3. Cases Rcor = 1, 1.5\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n\n9\n\nFigure 11. Forces (top panels) and velocities (bottom panels) along the field lines in the propeller regime at T = 1400. Left panels: forces and\nvelocities along the closed magnetic field line which starts in the disk (at r = 4.3) and ends on the star. We take only the part of the line up to\nthe neutral point where the line curves towards the star(Br = 0). Forces are projected onto the field line. Labels are the same as in Fig. 6. Right\npanels: forces and velocities along the open field line which starts on the surface of the star. Note that the scale for vA , vsm , vfm is different from\nthat for other velocities.\n\ncorrespond to the propeller regime where the star spins down\ndue to the interaction with the disk and corona. We did not\nperform a refined search for the rotational equilibrium state,\nin which the star has alternate spin-up and spin-down periods, but zero torque on an average (e.g. R02, Long et al.\n2005). In this state we expect the jet component to occupy\na large part of the region above conical winds. Even a weak\nstellar wind (not considered in this paper) may enhance the\njet component.\n\n3.2\n\nMatter flow, velocities and forces in the propeller\nregime\n\nHere we consider outflows from rapidly rotating stars in the\npropeller regime. In earlier work we performed multiple simulation runs of the propeller stage at a wide variety of parameters (R05; U06). Here we take the reference run shown\nin R05 and perform additional analysis. The parameters are\nP\u2217 = 1 day, \u03b1v = 0.3 and \u03b1d = 0.2 (see \u00a72.3.2 for the other\nparameter values).\nFig. 8 shows snapshots of the matter flow in the propeller\nregime at different times T . One can see that the outflow appears at T \u2248 50 and continues for a long time (T = 2200 rotations, or about 6 years in application to protostars). These\nsimulations are about 10 times longer than previous simulations of outflows from a real disk (e.g. Goodson et al. 1997;\nMatt et al. 2002; K\u00fcker et al. 2003). They are comparable in\nlength with simulations of outflows from the disk as a boundary condition (e.g., Fendt 2009), although here we consider\noutflows form the \"real\" cold disk to a hot low-density corona.\nFig. 8 also shows that the outflow has two components.\nOne is a conical-shaped wind similar to the conical winds of\nslowly rotating stars discussed earlier. The other component\nis a fast flow of matter interior to the conical winds, which\nwe term the axial jet. The disk-magnetosphere interaction\nis strongly non-stationary; the magnetic field lines episodically inflate and the disk oscillates. The conical wind com-\n\nponent seems to be weakly collimated inside the simulation\nregion. The jet component has stronger collimation. The jet\ncollimation is stronger in the flow closer to the axis, and\nis enhanced during periods of strong inflation, like at times\nT = 560 and 870. See animations of propeller-driven outflows\nat http://www.astro.cornell.edu/\u223cromanova/propeller.htm.\nFig. 9 shows a typical snapshot from our simulations at\ntime T = 1400, with the dimensionless density and velocity\nat sample points (see Table 1 for reference values). One can\nsee that the velocities in the conical wind component are similar to those in conical winds around slowly rotating stars.\nMatter launched from the disk has a velocity that is mainly\nazimuthal and approximately Keplerian. It is gradually accelerated to poloidal velocities vp \u223c (0.3 \u2212 0.5)vK . The flow has\na high density and carries most of the disk mass into the outflows. The situation is the opposite in the axial jet component:\nthe density is 102 \u2212103 times lower, while the poloidal and total velocities are much higher. Thus we find a two-component\noutflow: a dense, slow conical wind and a low-density, fast\naxial jet.\nFig. 10 shows the time-variation of the equatorial density\nand the poloidal magnetic field in the inner part of the simulation region. One can see that the density and the poloidal\nmagnetic field are strongly enhanced at the inner edge of the\ndisk, and the inner disk radius shows large oscillation (see\nalso R05, U06).\nFig. 11a shows the projection of different forces onto a\nclosed field line which starts in the disk at r = 4.3 where the\nbase of the conical wind (see Fig. 9). We take only the part of\nthe line from the disk to the neutral point where Br = 0 (this\nis the analog of part AB of the line in Fig. 5e). One can see\nthat the forces are large but more or less compensate each\nother. The magnetic force (M ) seems to drive matter from\nthe disk into the conical wind, though other forces, such as\nthe centrifugal (C) and pressure gradient (P ) forces are also\nimportant. It is interesting that conical winds in slowly rotating stars and in stars in the propeller regime are similar, but\n\n\f10\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nFigure 12.

Panel f: same\nbut for FLm and the viscous flux FLv (dashed line).\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\nthat the distribution of forces is somewhat different. In conical winds the winding of the field lines gives rise to a magnetic\nforce in one localized region (above the inner disk) and this\nforce dominates. In the propeller regime the disk oscillates\nstrongly, and it is important that the magnetosphere presents\na centrifugal barrier for this matter, and therefore the centrifugal and pressure gradient forces have a larger role. The\nmagnetic force remains important.\nPanel b shows the forces along the coronal field line\nwhich starts on the surface of the star. We consider the second line from the axis in Fig. 9, which is strongly inflated and\nis a representative line for the description of matter flow into\nthe axial jet. One can see that the magnetic force M is much\nlarger than the other forces and is the main force accelerating\nmatter into the jet.\nPanel c shows velocities along the disk field line (as in\npanel a). One can see that the azimuthal component v\u03c6 dominates, while the poloidal velocity vp increases gradually from\na very small value near the disk up to values comparable with\nv\u03c6 . It crosses the slow magnetosonic surface just above the\ndisk, and later, the Alfv\u00e9n and the fast magnetosonic surfaces.\nPanel d shows that in the coronal region, the velocities\nare high and the poloidal velocity dominates. Matter crosses\nthe slow magnetosonic surface but stays sub-Alfv\u00e9nic. Both\nthe Alfv\u00e9n, vA , and the fast magnetosonic, vfm , velocities are\nabout 10 times larger than the flow velocity in the axial jet\n(note the scale at the right-hand side). The flow is in the\nPoynting flux regime found in simulations by Ustyugova et al.\n(2000) and analyzed theoretically by Lovelace et al. (2002).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nANALYSIS OF FLUXES: MATTER, ENERGY, ANGULAR\nMOMENTUM\nFluxes in Conical winds\n\nFig. 12a shows the matter flux distribution Fm and a neutral\nline of the magnetic field where Br = 0. This line separates\nthe field lines starting on the disk from those starting on the\nstar. One can see that the conical wind flows along both sets\nof field lines. Panel d shows that the matter flux Fm has a\nsharp peak in its angular distribution (at r = 6), that is, the\nwall of the cone is narrow. The position of the Br = 0 line in\nthis panel shows that matter flows along both the stellar and\nthe disk field lines. For \u03b8 > 75\u25e6 , the matter flux is dominated\nby the disk and is negative. We also see that the density \u03c1 is\nlow in the corona. In the disk the density increases to much\nlarger values, \u03c1 = 1 \u2212 10. There is also a low-density gap at\n\u03b8 \u223c 45\u25e6 where matter is accelerated to high velocities.\nThe energy flux FE is the sum of the matter component\nFEm and the field component FEf where\n\u201e\n\u00ab\n\" c \"\n1 2\nFEm = \u03c1vp\nv + w + \u03a6g , FEf =\n(E \u00d7 B)p , (5)\n2\n4\u03c0\nwhere w is the enthalpy and \u03a6g is the gravitational potential.\nFig. 12b shows that the magnetic field energy flux FEf is\nhigh near the star, at the base of the conical wind and in the\nregion of fast flow. Panel e shows that the energy flux FEf at\nr = 6 has a peak in the region of the conical wind.\nFig. 12c shows that the distribution of the matter energy flux, FEm , is similar to the matter flux distribution. The\npanel also shows that in the conical wind, matter crosses\n\n11\n\nall the critical surfaces. It ends up flowing with a super-fastmagnetosonic velocity. In contrast, in the corona, away from\nthe regions of outflow, the flow is sub-slow-magnetosonic.\nPanel f shows that the entropy S is high in the corona and\nlow in the conical wind and the disk.\nFig. 13a and d shows the ratio of the gas and magnetic\npressures, which is the conventional \u03b2 parameter. We also use\nwhat we term the kinetic parameter \u03b21 , where\n\u03b2=\n\np\nB 2 /8\u03c0\n\n,\n\n\u03b21 =\n\np + \u03c1v 2\n.\nB 2 /8\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nThe flow region is magnetically dominated when the \u03b2 or \u03b21 is\nless than unity. The magnetic pressure dominates only in the\nregion near the star in the conical wind case. The situation\nis different in the propeller regime where the axial region is\nmagnetically dominated (see \u00a74).\nWe calculate the angular momentum flux distribution\nwhich consists of three components, FL = FLm + FLf + FLv ,\nwhere FLm , FLf and FLv are the angular momentum fluxes\ncarried by the matter, the magnetic field, and the viscosity:\nFLf = \u2212r sin \u03b8\n\nFLm\n\n=\n\nr sin \u03b8\u03c1v\u03c6 vp ,\n\nFLv\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03bdt \u03c1(r sin \u03b8)2 \u2207\u03a9 .\n\nB \u03c6 Bp\n,\n4\u03c0\n(7)\n\nFig. 13b shows that the magnetic component FLf of the flux,\ndominates near the star and in the part of the conical wind\nclose to the disk. The streamlines show that angular momentum flows from the disk onto the star, from the disk into the\nconical wind, and from the star into the corona. Panel c shows\nthat the conical winds carry away angular momentum associated with matter, FLm . The magnetic component is also\nhigh at the base of conical wind. However, at larger distances\nthis angular momentum is converted into angular momentum carried by matter. Comparison of panels e and f shows\nthat at r = 6, the angular momentum carried by the matter is much larger than that carried by the field. Panel e also\nshows that some angular momentum flows into the disk wind\n(at \u03b8 > 60\u25e6 ). Panel f shows that the angular momentum carried by viscosity is significant. The disk viscous component is\nmuch larger than the matter component flowing into the conical wind, so most of the angular momentum flows outward\nalong the disk.\nWe also calculated the matter and angular momentum\nfluxes flowing through the surface of the star, and through a\nspherical surface of radius r = 6.\nZ\n\u1e40 = dS * Fm ,\nFm = \u03c1vp ,\n(8)\nZ\nL\u0307 =\n\ndS * (FLm + FLf + FLv ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere dS is the surface area element directed outward. Fig.\n14 (left panels) shows that about 2/3 of the incoming disk\nmatter flows to the star, and the rest going into the conical\nwind. Fluxes into the wind oscillate due to magnetic field inflation and reconnection events. The right-hand panels show\nthat angular momentum flows inward with the disk matter,\nL\u0307dm . Part of this angular momentum is carried away by the\nconical wind. Angular momentum is carried mainly by matter, L\u0307wm >> L\u0307wf . Part of the disk angular momentum flows\nto the star and spins it up (the star rotates slowly in that\nrcor = 3). The angular momentum carried to the star by\n\n\f12\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nFigure 14. Panel a: matter flux onto the star \u1e40s , into the conical wind \u1e40w , and through the disk \u1e40d . Panel b: angular momentum flux carried\nby the disk L\u0307d , onto the star carried by matter L\u0307sm and by the magnetic field L\u0307sf . The angular momentum flux of the conical wind carried by\nmatter is L\u0307wm and that carried by the field is L\u0307wf . Panels c, d show the time dependence of these fluxes.\n\nthe matter, L\u0307sm , is converted into angular momentum carried by the field, L\u0307sf , and hence on the surface of the star\nL\u0307sf >> L\u0307sm (see also R02). One can see from Fig. 14 that all\nthese fluxes are smaller than the flux carried by the disk matter. This means that the main part of the angular momentum\nof the disk flows outward to larger distances due to viscosity.\n\n4.2\n\nFluxes in the propeller regime\n\nWe analyze fluxes in the propeller regime in a similar manner\nto that for the conical winds. Fig. 15a shows the distribution\nof the poloidal matter flux Fm in the background with the\nvectors Fm on top. The neutral line (dashed white line) separates the field lines which start in the disk from those which\nstart on the star.\nPanel d shows that most of the matter flows along field\nlines threading the disk, although some matter flows along\nthe stellar field lines. For \u03b8 > 80\u25e6 (in the disk region) the matter flux becomes much larger and negative (we exclude this\npart of the plot to show the conical wind part more clearly).\nThe plot of the density shows that the density is very low on\nthe axis but gradually increases toward the region of the conical wind and continues to grow towards the disk.\nPanel b shows the distribution of the magnetic energy\nflux FEf . One can see that a strong flux of magnetic energy\n(Poynting flux) flows into the corona. This is the region where\nmatter is accelerated to high velocities (see velocity vectors).\nPanel e shows that at r = 10 the magnetic energy flux is very\nlarge, and is distributed over a range of angles with a maximum at \u03b8 \u223c 25\u25e6 (not on the axis). The plot also shows that\nthe poloidal velocity is slightly larger than the azimuthal velocity and both velocities are high, up to vp = 2 (which is 400\nkm/s for protostars). The jet component is smaller in the case\nof slowly rotating stars.\nPanel c shows the energy flux associated with the matter\n\nflow. One can see that matter in the conical wind crosses the\nslow magnetosonic surface v = vsm just above the disk, and\nsoon crosses the Alfv\u00e9n surface v = vA , and the fast magnetosonic surface v = vfm . Panel f shows that the matter energy\nflux distribution has a sharp peak in the region of the conical\nwind and that the entropy S is high in the corona but drops\ntowards the disk.\nComparison of panels e and f shows that the maximum of\nthe energy flux carried by the magnetic field into the jet, FEf ,\nis about 3 times larger than that carried by the matter into\nconical winds, FEm . In addition, the integrated flux carried\nby the magnetic field is a few times larger. Therefore, the cumulative energy flux carried by the magnetic field into the jet\n(the Poynting flux) is about 10 times larger than that carried\nby matter. This means that the jet component is 10 times more\npowerful. Part of this energy is converted into kinetic energy\nof the fast component inside the simulation region. However,\nmost of the magnetic energy may be transferred to particles\nor converted into radiation at larger distances from the star.\nNext, we analyze the angular momentum flow. Fig. 16a\nshows the \u03b2-parameter in the background and the \u03b2 = 1 and\n\u03b21 = 1 surfaces in the foreground (see equation 6). One can\nsee that the magnetic energy dominates in the whole axial\ncoronal region interior to the conical wind (\u03b21 < 1 and \u03b2 <\n1). If one uses only the standard criterion \u03b2 = 1, then one\ncan see that the region above the disk is also magnetically\ndominated (\u03b2 < 1). Panel d shows the angular distribution of\n\u03b2 and \u03b21 at r = 10.\nPanel b shows the distribution of the angular momentum\nflux carried by the magnetic field, FLf , and the streamlines associated with this flux. One can see that a significant amount\nof angular momentum flux flows from the star into the corona\nalong the stellar field lines. Panel e shows that the angular\nmomentum flows out along the set of field lines between the\naxis and the neutral field line with a maximum right above\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\nthe conical wind component. Some of them thread the lowdensity corona, while others thread the upper part of the conical wind above the neutral line. These panels also show that\na significant amount of angular momentum flows from the\ninner part of the disk. See U06 for detailed analysis of the\ndifferent components of the angular momentum flow.\nPanel c shows that the angular momentum flux carried\nby the matter is also large and is carried by the conical wind.\nPanel f shows that most of this angular momentum flows\nalong the disk field lines while some angular momentum\nflows along the stellar field lines.\nFig. 17a shows the matter fluxes onto the star \u1e40s , and\ninto the outflows, \u1e40w , integrated over a surface with radius\nr = 10 (any flow with vr > 0 is taken into account). One\ncan see that the matter flux into the wind is much larger\nthan that onto the star, \u1e40w >> \u1e40s , that is, almost all disk\nmatter is ejected from the system into the outflows. Here\nwe should note that we consider the \"strong propeller\" case,\nrcor << rm . If the star rotates slower, then the fraction of\nthe matter flux going into the wind decreases, and a larger\nportion of the matter may accrete onto the star (see U06 for\ndependences of matter fluxes on \u03a9\u2217 , B\u2217 , \u03b1v and \u03b1d .) Both\nfluxes are strongly variable and show episodic enhancement\nof accretion and outflows. Simulations show that an interval\nbetween the strongest outbursts increases when diffusivity coefficient \u03b1d decreases (R05, U06).\nPanel b shows the integrated angular momentum fluxes\nthrough the same r = 10 surface. Here we calculate separately the angular momentum fluxes carried by the field and\nby the matter. One can see that the star spins down due to the\nangular momentum carried by the magnetic field, L\u0307sf , while\nthe angular momentum carried by the matter flow, L\u0307sm , is\nnegligibly small. The angular momentum outflow from the\nstar, L\u0307sf , almost coincides with the angular momentum carried by magnetic field lines into the magnetically-dominated\njet, L\u0307wf . This indicates that angular momentum flows from\nthe star into the magnetically dominated axial jet. Thus a star\nin the propeller regime is expected to spin down rapidly due\nto angular momentum flow into the magnetically-dominated\naxial jet. Analysis of U06 shows that this jet angular momentum is approximately equally split between the flux carried\ninto the corona along open field lines, and the flux which\nflows along partially inflated field lines which close inside the\nsimulation region and are connected with both the star and\nthe disk. Panel c shows that the angular momentum carried\nby matter into the conical winds, L\u0307wm is approximately equal\nto that carried by the field to the corona. The bottom panels\nshow the same plots at higher time resolution. Therefore, the\nstar-disk system loses its angular momentum through both\nthe wind and jet components, via the inner disk and star respectively. So, there is no problem with excess angular momentum in the star-disk-system; it flows into the jet/wind.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nOTHER PROPERTIES OF OUTFLOWS\nInflation of Field Lines and Disk Oscillations\n\nThe field lines connecting the disk and the star have the\ntendency to inflate (e.g., Lovelace, Romanova & BisnovatyiKogan 1995). Quasi-periodic reconstruction of the magnetosphere due to inflation and reconnection has been discussed\n\n13\n\ntheoretically (Aly & Kuijpers 1990; Uzdensky, Litwin & K\u00f6nigl\n2003) and has been observed in a number of axisymmetrtic\nsimulations (Hirose et al. 1997; Goodson et al. 1997, 1999;\nMatt et al. 2002; Romanova et al. 2002 - hereafter R02; von\nRekowski & Brandenburg 2004). Goodson & Winglee (1999)\ndiscuss the physics of inflation cycles. They have shown that\neach cycle of inflation consists of a period of matter accumulation near the magnetosphere, diffusion of this matter through\nthe magnetospheric field, inflation of the corresponding field\nlines, accretion of some matter onto the star, and outflow of\nsome matter as winds, with subsequent expansion of the magnetosphere. There simulations show 5 \u2212 6 cycles of inflation\nand reconnection.\nOur simulations show 30 \u2212 50 cycles of inflation and reconnection in the propeller regime. We chose one outburst\nfrom our simulations and plotted the density and a fixed set\nof magnetic field lines at different times. Fig. 18 shows that at\nT = 890, the magnetosphere is relatively expanded, although\nsome matter accretes around the expanded field lines (see\nalso Romanova et al. 2004a). At T = 900, the disk matter\ncomes closer to the star and some field lines inflate or partially inflate, thus blocking accretion. At T = 910 even more\nfield lines inflate and accretion is blocked. However, outflow\nis permitted at both of these moments of time. At T = 916,\nthe internal field lines reconnect, permitting accretion onto\nthe star. At T = 921, the magnetosphere expands and accretion onto the star is again prevented. Later, at T = 927, the\nfield lines reconnect and some matter accretes along a longer\npath \u2013 around the expanded magnetosphere. This picture is\nsimilar to that described by Goodson & Winglee (1999).\nFig. 17d shows that the time interval between the\nstrongest outbursts in the propeller regime is \u2206T \u2248 50 \u2212 70.\nIn application to protostars and CTTSs (P0 = 1.04 days) this\ntime corresponds to (\u2206t)outb = 52 \u2212 73 days. In some young\nstars, like CTTS HH30 (XZ Tau), for example, the outbursts\ninto the jet occur at intervals of a few months, which hints\nthat episodic inflation of field lines may be responsible for\nsome outbursts. During the outbursts, the matter flux into\noutflows increases several times and the velocities also increase. This may lead to the formation of new blobs or to the\ngeneration of shock waves in the outflow. This mechanism\nmay be relevant for formation of blobs or shocks in protostars\nand rapidly rotating CTTSs. In slowly rotating stars, the timeinterval between outbursts is smaller, (\u2206t)outb \u2248 5 days (see\nFig. 14), so the outbursts have a smaller amplitude but are\nmore frequent. The interval depends on the diffusivity in the\ndisk, \u03b1d . At very small diffusivity the time-interval between\noutbursts may be much larger.\nDiffusivity is important for reconnection processes in the\ncorona. We have diffusivity only in the disk. We choose a\ncertain density level \u03c1d = 0.3 below which the diffusivity\nis absent, so that high-density regions, \u03c1 > 0.3, which correspond to the disk and the funnel streams, have diffusivity, and low-density regions do not. In the corona and the\nconical outflows, the diffusivity has only a numerical origin\nand is small. Namely, we observe in simulations that in conical winds, the two layers of plasma with an oppositely directed magnetic field reconnect only slowly. Similar behavior\nhas been observed in ideal MHD simulations by Fendt & Elstner (2000). An anomalous (high) diffusivity was added by\nHayashi et al. (1996) to a part of the simulation region to\nenhance the reconnection process in the inflating plasmoids.\n\n\f14\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nDiffusivity had been added into the whole simulation region\nby Fendt & Cemelji\u0107 (2002). They observed that at higher diffusivity the level of collimation by the magnetic field and the\nLorentz force decrease, while the centrifugal force increases.\nWe performed exploratory simulations with non-zero diffusivity in the corona. We added to the corona the same diffusivity\nas in the disk with \u03b1d = 0.1 \u2212 0.2, which operates at different\ndensity levels, \u03c1 > \u03c1d , where \u03c1d = 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and in the\nwhole simulation region (formally, \u03c1d = 0). We observed that\nin case of conical winds (slowly rotating stars) the diffusivity\nin the corona does not change the result. However, in case of\npropeller-driven winds, we observed that propeller becomes\nweaker. We believe that the difference is in the fact that in\nthe case of conical winds, the wind and the neutral line of\nthe inflated magnetic field have approximately the same position in space, leading to slower reconnection. In the other\ncase, in the propeller regime the inner disk and the region of\noutflows strongly oscillates, and so the position of the neutral line varies, and hence the reconnection is forced (that is,\nthe plasma layers with oppositely directed fields are pushed\ntowards each other by an external force).\n5.2\n\nMatter loading onto stellar field lines, and possible\nrole of stellar wind\n\nHere we discuss how the disk matter gets loaded onto the\nstellar field lines and then flows into the jet in the propeller\nregime (where the jet is strong). It is important to have diffusivity in the disk, so that the matter of the disk threads the\nfield lines of the star and flows onto the star in funnel streams.\nWhen a sufficient amount of matter is accumulated in the inner disk, the field lines connecting the star and the disk inflate. During and after inflation, part of the disk matter ends\nup on the field lines connecting the disk with corona (usually most of the matter flows along these field lines). Another,\nsmaller part of the matter ends on the field lines connecting\nthe star with the corona. For example, Fig. 15a demonstrates\nthe result of such inflation, where the neutral line dividing\nthe stellar and disk lines is in the middle of the conical wind\ncomponent. On the other hand, when matter flows in a funnel\nstream, most of it accretes onto the star. However, part of it\nis stripped away by the magnetic and centrifugal forces and\nflows into the jet along the stellar field lines. Fig. 19 shows\nthat there is a dividing line running through the upper part of\nthe funnel stream, separating the regions from which matter\nflows onto the star (most of it) from those from which it flows\ninto the jet along the stellar field lines (a small fraction). In\nthe funnel region the density is usually high enough so that\nthe diffusivity which works in our disk also works in the funnel stream. This diffusivity helps launch matter from the funnel stream field lines onto the coronal, jet field lines. Both\nprocesses are consistent with the strong decrease in coronal\nmatter density along the axis. This region is \"matter-starved\".\nOur simulations do not take into account possible stellar\nwinds. Even a weak wind from the star may have a significant\ninfluence on the axial region of the jet in the propeller regime\nand the \"matter-starved\" jet region in slowly rotating stars.\nThe existence of powerful stellar winds was suggested by Matt\n& Pudritz (2005, 2008) in order to explain the loss of angular\nmomentum by young stars. The spectra of many CTTSs (e.g.\nEdwards et al. 2003; Dupree et al. 2005) require up to 10%\nof the disk mass flowing out as winds, in order to explain\n\ndifferent spectral lines (Edwards 2009). No such winds are\nobserved in diskless, weak-line T Tauri stars. Hence, the winds\nmust be accretion-driven (e.g., Edwards et al. 2006; Kwan et\nal. 2007). The physics of these accretion-driven stellar winds\nis not understood yet. In the standard approach it is suggested\nthat matter falling onto the surface of the star through the\nfunnel stream forms a shock near the surface and is heated\nby this shock. However, it cools rapidly in the radiative zone\nbehind the shock wave, and no reverse flow into the wind is\nexpected (e.g., Lamzin 1998; Koldoba et al. 2008). In another\ninvestigation, however, Alfv\u00e9n waves and other processes at\nthe stellar surface help accelerate up to 1% of the accreting\ndisk matter into the wind (e.g. Cranmer 2008). We did not\nincorporate stellar winds into the present simulations. Weak\nwinds may help supply matter to the magnetically-accelerated\naxial jets and the \"matter-starved\" region of fast flow in slowly\nrotating stars. On the other hand, if the wind is very strong,\nsay \u1e40sw \u223c 0.1\u1e40d , it will probably be matter-dominated at\nmoderate distances from the star (say & 10 stellar radii) and\nwill have a decollimating effect on the outflows (Fendt 2009).\nIn summary, a weak stellar wind will contribute matter to the\njet component.\n\n5.3\n\nCollimation of outflows\n\nCollimation of conical winds. We observe conical winds in\nboth slowly and rapidly rotating stars. In both cases, matter in\nthe conical winds passes through the Alfv\u00e9n surface, beyond\nwhich the flow becomes matter-dominated. We note that in\nslowly rotating stars, the distribution of the poloidal current\nJp (see Fig. 5c) is such that the corresponding magnetic force\nhas a component towards the axis. This may explain why\nconical winds show some collimation (see Fig. 2). The conical wind component of the propeller-driven outflows shows\nstronger collimation during periods of inflation and outbursts\n(see Fig. 8). However, this collimation may not be sufficient\nto explain well-collimated jets.\nConical winds may be further collimated at larger distances\nfrom the star either by the pressure of the external medium\n(Lovelace et al. 1991; Frank & Mellema 1996), or by disk\nwinds (K\u00f6nigl & Pudritz 2000; Ferreira et al. 2006; Matsakos\net al. 2008; Fendt 2009). In addition, Matt, Winglee, & B\u00f6hm\n(2003) have shown that a weak axial magnetic field (B <<\n0.1 G) associated with the disk, may collimate the winds at a\ndistance of a few AU.\nCollimation of the jet. In the propeller regime, the jet component is self-collimated by the magnetic hoop-stress. The\nlevel of collimation increases towards the axis. The poloidal\nvelocity in the jet also increases towards the axis, and varies\nbetween vp \u2248 2 near the axis and vp \u2248 0.2 near the conical wind. That is why we choose a few typical velocity levels\nvp = vc , with vc = 0.5, 1 and 1.5, and plot lines of equal\nvelocity (Fig. 20). In application to protostars, the fast component of the jet, vp & 200 km/s, carries \u223c 2% of the mass\nand \u223c 22%/0.6 \u2248 37% of the angular momentum flux out\nof the star. At the lower velocity limit, vp & 100 km/s, these\nnumbers are 10% and 35%/0.6 \u2248 60%.\nIt is of interest to know the dependence of the mass outflow rate on the poloidal velocity vp . We calculate the matter\nflux \u1e40 (vp > vc ) through the external boundary r = Rout at\npoloidal velocities above a certain value vc for different val-\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n\n15\n\nFigure 15.

Panel a shows that the jet component with vp > 0.5\ncarries about 10% of the total outflowing mass \u1e40w , while the\nvery fast components, vp > 1.5 and vp > 1 carry only about\n1% and 2% correspondingly. So, about 10% of the total mass\nflows into the collimated jet. The fractions of matter flowing\ninto different parts of the jet and into the conical wind are\nshown in the left panel.\nThe jet carries angular momentum out of the star along\ndifferent field lines corresponding to different vp . It is of interest to know which part of the jet carries most of the angular\nmomentum. We calculate the angular momentum flux carried\n\nby the magnetic field L\u0307f (vp > vc ) (this component dominates\nin the jet) through the external boundary and normalize it to\nthe total magnetic flux through this boundary, L\u0307wf . Panel b\nshows that the high-velocity part of the jet, vp > 1.5, carries\nabout 13% of the total angular momentum flux, while the entire inner part of the jet in the velocity intervals vp > 1 and\nvp > 0.5 carry 22% and 35% of the flux correspondingly. Another fraction (12%) flows out along stellar field lines threading the conical wind component and the low-velocity area\nabove it. All this flux is responsible for spinning down the\nstar (which is about 60% of the total flux). The rest of the\n\n\f16\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nFigure 17.

We conclude that the jet component\nabove the conical wind carries a relatively small mass but has\na significant contribution to the angular momentum outflow\nfrom the star. Note that only about half the star's angular momentum flows into the jet. The other half is associated with\nstar-disk interaction through the field lines which are closed\ninside the simulation region and were not taken into account\nin this analysis (see U06 for details). In application to protostars, the fast component of the jet, vp & 200 km/s, carries\n\u223c 2% of the mass and \u223c 22%/0.6 \u2248 37% of the angular\nmomentum flux out of the star.

We chose a case where the dipole magnetic\nfield of the star is misaligned with the rotation axis (of the\nstar and disk) by an angle \u0398 = 30\u25e6 . One question is what\nthe direction of the conical wind is in the case of an inclined dipole. We used the Godunov-type 3D MHD \"cubed\nsphere\" code developed by Koldoba et al. (2002). In the past\nwe have used this code to study magnetospheric accretion\nclose to the star (Romanova et al. 2003, 2004b). Compared\nwith that work we decreased the density in the corona by a\nfactor of 10 to \u03c1c = 0.001 and created conditions suitable\nfor bunching of the field lines. We used a grid resolution of\nNr \u00d7 N 2 = 120 \u00d7 512 in each of 6 blocks of the sphere. We\ntook the density in the disk to be \u03c1d = 2 which is 5 times lower\nthan in the axisymmetric case shown above. At the same time,\nwe chose a smaller magnetic moment for the star, \u03bc = 2 compared to \u03bc = 10 in the axisymmetric case (to reduce the computing time). We start the disk flow not from large distances\nbut from r = 5, to limit the computing time. The bunching\nof field lines is achieved by having a sufficiently high viscosity, \u03b1v = 0.3. We do not have diffusivity in the 3D code, but\nat the grid resolution we use, the estimated numerical diffusivity at the disk-magnetosphere boundary is at the level of\n\u03b1d \u223c 0.01 \u2212 0.02, and hence the main condition for conical\nwind formation, Prm & 1, is satisfied (see also Appendix C).\nSimulations show that the accreting matter bunches up\nfield lines and some matter flows out as a conical wind. Fig.\n21 shows that the wind is geometrically symmetric about the\nrotation axis. However, the density distribution in the wind\nshows a spiral structure which rotates with the angular velocity of the star, \u03a9\u2217 , and represents a one-armed spiral wave\nfrom each side of the outflow.\nNote that for high \u03b1v (0.3 in this case), the diskmagnetosphere boundary may exhibit the magnetic interchange instability (Romanova, Kulkarni & Lovelace 2008;\nKulkarni & Romanova 2008). In these simulations we do observe some accretion due to this instability in addition to the\nmain funnel stream accretion that dominates at high misalignment angles, \u0398 & 30\u25e6 (Kulkarni & Romanova 2009).\n\nHowever, the conical wind originates at larger radii compared\nwith the inner disk radius where accretion through instability\ndominates. We believe that both processes can \"peacefully\"\nco-exist for \u0398 & 30\u25e6 . However, in other situations the conical wind may be influenced by the interchange instability. For\nexample, we did not try to investigate outflows at small \u0398\nwhere accretion through instability often dominates. Accretion through instability opens up a new path for penetration\nof matter through the magnetosphere, and thus may possibly decrease the bunching of field lines and consequently the\nstrength of conical winds. This interrelation between instabilities and conical winds needs to be investigated in future 3D\nsimulations. Longer simulations should be performed, and accretion to rapidly rotating stars should also be examined.\n\n7\n\nCOMPARISON WITH THE X-WIND MODEL\n\nWinds from the disk-magnetosphere boundary have been proposed earlier by Shu and collaborators and referred to as Xwinds (e.g., Shu et al. 1994). In this model, X-winds originate\nfrom a small region near the corotation radius rcor , while the\ndisk truncation radius rt (or, the magnetospheric radius rm )\nis only slightly smaller than rcor (rm \u2248 0.7rcor , Shu et al.\n1994). It is suggested that excess angular momentum flows\nfrom the star to the disk and from there into the X-winds. The\nmodel aims to explain the slow rotation of the star and the\nformation of jets. In the simulations discussed here we have\nobtained outflows from both slowly and rapidly rotating stars.\nBoth have conical wind components which are reminiscent of\nX-winds. What, then, is the difference between X-winds, conical winds and propeller-driven winds?\nIn some respects conical/propeller winds are similar to\nX-winds: (1) They both require bunching of the poloidal field\nlines and show outflows from the inner disk; (2) They both\nhave high rotation and show gradual poloidal acceleration\n(e.g., Najita & Shu 1994).\nThe differences are the following: (1) The conical/propeller outflows have two components: a slow highdensity conical wind (which can be considered as an analogue of the X-wind), and a fast low-density jet. No jet com-\n\n\f18\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nponent is discussed in the X-wind model. (2) Conical winds\nform around stars with any rotation rate including very slowly\nrotating stars. They do not require fine tuning of the corotation and truncation radii. For example, bunching of field\nlines is often expected during periods of enhanced or unstable accretion when the disk comes closer to the surface of the\nstar and rm << rcor . Under this condition conical winds will\nform. In contrast, X-winds require rm \u2248 rcor . (3) The base\nof the conical wind component in both slowly and rapidly rotating stars is associated with the region where the field lines\nare bunched up, and not with the corotation radius. (4) Xwinds are driven by the centrifugal force (Blandford & Payne\n1982), and as a result matter flows over a wide range of directions below the \"dead zone\" (Shu et al. 1994; Ostriker & Shu\n1995). In conical winds the matter is driven by the magnetic\nforce (Lovelace et al. 1991) which acts such that the matter\nflows into a thin shell with a cone angle \u03b8 \u223c 30\u25e6 . The same\nforce acts to partially collimate the flow. (5) In the X-wind\nmodel it is suggested that angular momentum flows from the\nstar to the disk in spite of the fact that the truncation radius\nof the disk is located at rm \u2248 0.7rcor and the disk rotates\nfaster than the star (Shu et al. 1994). Simulations show that\nif the funnel stream starts at rm < rcor , then angular momentum flows from the disk to the star along magnetic field\nlines of the funnel stream which form a leading spiral, and\nthe star spins up (R02, Romanova et al. 2003; Bessolaz et al.\n2008). The star may transfer its angular momentum to the\ndisk if rm > rcor , like in the propeller case considered above.\n(6) The X-wind regime is somewhat similar to the propeller\nregime, where the star transfers part of its angular momentum to the disk, and this excess angular momentum may flow\ninto the conical component of the wind. However, in the propeller regime, angular momentum also flows from the star\ninto the jet. (7) Conical and propeller-driven winds are nonstationary: the magnetic field constantly inflates and reconnects. X-winds, on the other hand, are steady. This difference,\nhowever, is not significant, and models can be compared using time-averaged characteristics.\n\n8\n\nAPPLICATION TO DIFFERENT STARS\n\n8.1\n\nApplication to Young Stars\n\nOur simulation results can be applied to different types of\nyoung stars, including low-mass protostars (class I YSOs)\nwhich often show powerful outflows, CTTSs (class II YSOs)\nwhich show less powerful outflows, EXors which show periods of strongly enhanced accretion and outflows, and young\nbrown dwarfs.\n\n8.1.1\n\nLow-mass protostars (class I YSOs)\n\nClass I protostars are young stars which are usually embedded inside a cloud of gas and dust. IR observations show that\nprotostars are surrounded by cold massive disks and that the\naccretion rate is usually an order of magnitude larger than in\nCTTSs, that is, \u1e40 \u223c (10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22127 )M /yr (e.g., Nisini et al.\n2005). The outflows are also more powerful than in CTTSs.\nThe stars are fully convective, and so rapid generation of a\nmagnetic field that may even be larger than in CTTSs is expected.\n\nFigure 21. Projections show formation of conical winds obtained in\n3D MHD simulations. Left panels show the distribution of matter flux\n(background) and sample magnetic field lines in the XZ plane at different moments of time. Right panels show corresponding YZ slices.\nArrows show the direction of the magnetic moment of the star \u03bc and\nangular velocity of rotation \u03a9\u2217 .\n\nWe consider a protostar of mass M0 = M = 0.8M , radius R\u2217 = 2R , and surface magnetic field B\u2217 = 3 \u00d7 103 G.\nThe dimensionless radius of the star (the inner boundary) is\n0.5, and the unit radius R0 = 2R\u2217 = 2.8\u00d71011 cm. The velocity scale is v0 = (GM/R0 )1/2 = 195 km/s, the time-scale is\nt0 = R0 /v0 = 0.16 days, and the period of rotation at R0 = 1\nis P0 = 1.04 days. We take a rapidly rotating star with period\nP\u2217 = 1.04 days (the corotation radius of rcor = 1). The other\nreference variables are shown in Table 1. For dimensionless\ntemperatures in the disk and corona of T\u0303d = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 and\nT\u0303c = 0.5, we obtain corresponding initial dimensional temperatures: Td = 2290 K and Tc = 2.3 \u00d7 106 K. Fig. 22 shows\nthe distribution of density and velocity around the protostar.\nThe age of protostars is 105 \u2212 106 years, and therefore they\nmay rotate more rapidly than CTTSs and it is likely that some\nof them are in the propeller regime. If the propeller is strong\nenough (like in our simulations, where the period P\u2217 \u2248 1 day\nand \u03b1v = 0.3) then most of the disk matter will be ejected as\nslow conical winds with velocity vp \u223c 50 km/s, which may be\nhigher if the disk is closer to the star. Most of the energy, however, flows into the magnetically-dominated axial jet, where a\nsmall fraction (about 10%) of the disk matter is accelerated up\nto vp \u223c 100 \u2212 400 km/s inside the simulation region. A huge\namount of angular momentum flows out of the star through\nthe same jet, and conical winds carry a comparable amount\nof angular momentum as well. This may solve the angular\nmomentum problem of the system. So, at this stage the outflows are powered by two things: the stellar rotational energy\nand the inner disk winds (the conical winds). Fig. 17b shows\nthat the outflow is strongly non-stationary with strong matter\nejection into jets/winds every 2\u22123 months. Ejection is accompanied by larger than average matter flux and velocities, and\nhence formation of new blobs or shock waves is expected.\nA protostar in the propeller regime loses its angular momentum to an axial jet. From the right-hand panels of Fig.\n17, we obtain the dimensionless value of the angular mo-\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n \u0303\nmentum loss: L\u0307\nsw \u2248 3, which corresponds to a dimensional\n \u0303 L\u0307 \u2248 9.3 \u00d7 1037 gcm2 /s2 . The star's\nvalue of L\u0307sw = L\u0307\nsw 0\nangular velocity is \u03a9\u2217 = 2\u03c0/P\u2217 \u2248 7 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121 , its angular momentum is J = kM r2 \u03a9\u2217 = 2.2 \u00d7 1051 k gcm2 /s,\nwhere k < 1. Taking k = 0.4, the spin-down time-scale is\n\u03c4 = J/L\u0307sw \u2248 3 \u00d7 105 years. Note that this time-scale is calculated for B\u2217 = 3 \u00d7 103 G. The time-scale decreases with the\nmagnetic field of the star as \u223c B\u2217\u22121.1 (see U06) and will be\n\u03c4 \u2248 3 \u00d7 106 years for B\u2217 = 103 G. If the magnetic field is\nweaker, then the protostar will continue to spin rapidly even\nin the CTTSs stage. U06 present the dependence of the spindown time-scale on the magnetic field, the spin of the star\nand other parameters.\n\n8.1.2\n\nClassical T Tauri Stars (class II YSOs)\n\nCTTSs and their jets have been extensively studied in recent\nyears. High-resolution observations of CTTSs show that the\noutflows often have an \"onion-skin\" structure, with bettercollimated, higher-velocity outflows in the axial region, and\nless-collimated, lower-velocity outflows at a larger distance\nfrom the axis (Bacciotti et al. 2000). In other observations,\nhigh angular resolution [FeII] \u03bb 1.644\u03bcm emission line maps\ntaken along the jets of DG Tau, HL Tau and RW Aurigae reveal\ntwo components: a high-velocity well-collimated extended\ncomponent with velocity v \u223c 200 \u2212 400 km/s, and a lowvelocity, v \u223c 100 km/s, uncollimated component closer to the\nstar (Pyo et al. 2003, 2006). High-resolution observations of\nmolecular hydrogen in HL Tau have shown that at small distances from the star, the flow shows a conical structure with\noutflow velocity \u223c 50 \u2212 80 km/s (Takami et al. 2007). In XZ\nTau, two-component outflows are observed: one component\nis a powerful but low-velocity conical wind with an opening\nangle of about 1 radian, and the other is a fast well-collimated\naxial jet (e.g., Krist et al. 2008). The origin of these outflows is\nnot known, but we can suggest that at least the lower-velocity\ncomponent may be explained by the conical winds suggesting\nthat the condition for bunching, Prm > 1, is satisfied. If a\nCTTS rotates rapidly (in the propeller regime) then the jet\ncomponent may originate from the propeller effect.\nSpectral observations of the He I (10830A) line show\nclear evidence of two-component outflows (Edwards et al.\n2003, 2006; Kwan et al. 2007). Observations show (see Fig.\n23) that at smaller accretion rates only the relatively lowvelocity component, v . 100 km/s, appears. At higher accretion rates there is evidence of a very fast component with\nv \u223c 200-400 km/s which requires an outflow rate of up to\n\u1e40w \u223c 0.1\u1e40d (Edwards et al. 2006; Edwards 2009). We suggest that the low-velocity component may be a conical wind.\nHowever, it is not clear what can explain the high-velocity\ncomponent. Even if a star is in the propeller regime, then at\nthe required velocities v > 200 km/s, only (2-3)% of the disk\nmatter flows into the jet. Possibly, additional matter influx\nfrom the wind of the star may enhance the matter flux into\nthe jet component. In another example, observations of the\nH\u03b2 spectral line in RW Aurigae, and comparison of possible\noutflow geometries led to the conclusion that a thin coneshaped wind with a half-opening angle of 30\u25e6 \u2212 40\u25e6 gives the\nbest fit to the observations (from Alencar et al. 2005; see Fig.\n24).\nThe strongest outbursts supplying CTTS jets are usually\n\n19\n\nepisodic or quasi-periodic (e.g., Ray et al. 2007). For example, blobs are ejected every few months in HH30 (XZ Tau),\nand every 5 years in DG Tau (Pyo et al. 2003). Both of these\nmay be connected with episodes of enhanced accretion and\nformation of conical winds. The velocity and density in the\noutflow are larger during periods of enhanced accretion, because the disk comes closer. If the CTTS is in a binary system,\nthen the accretion rate may be episodically enhanced due to\ninteraction with the secondary star, and this may explain the\nlonger intervals of a few years) between outbursts observed\nin other CTTSs. Events of fast, implosive accretion are also\npossible due to thermal or global magnetic instabilities (e.g.,\nLovelace et al. 1994). Alternatively, a period of a few months\nmay be connected with long-term episodes of oscillations of\nthe magnetosphere. In the propeller regime the time-interval\nbetween oscillations is 1-2 months even for mild parameters.\nBouvier et al. (2007) have shown that magnetospheric expansion in the CTTS AA Tau may occur with a period of a few\nweeks. Multi-year observations of variability in CTTSs show\nthat they are strongly variable on different time-scales (e.g.,\nHerbst et al. 2004; Grankin et al. 2007) which is probably\nconnected with periods of enhanced accretion.\nFor CTTSs we suggest the same parameters as for protostars but take a weaker magnetic field, B = 103 G, so\nthat for the same dimensionless runs we obtain lower accretion rates (see Table 1). Taking from Fig. 14c the dimen \u0303 \u2248 3.8,\nsionless values of the matter flux onto the star, \u1e40\ns\n \u0303\nand into the conical winds, \u1e40w \u2248 1.3, and taking the value\nof \u1e400 Table 1, we obtain an accretion rate onto the star of\n \u0303 \u1e40 \u2248 7.6 \u00d7 10\u22128 M /yr and into the wind of\n\u1e40s = \u1e40\ns\n0\n\u1e40w \u2248 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22128 M /yr. For a corotation radius of rcor = 3,\nthe period of the CTTS is P\u2217 = 5.6 days. In typical simulation\nrun the truncation radius rm \u2248 1.2 is much smaller than the\ncorotation radius rcor = 3. This situation corresponds to the\ncase of enhanced accretion when the star spins up, and which\ncorresponds to ejection of conical winds.\nMany CTTSs are expected to be in the rotational equilibrium state, when rm \u2248 rcor . Without the bunching condition,\nand at small viscosity and diffusivity parameters, no significant outflows had been observed in simulations (R02; Long\net al. 2005). On the other hand, if the bunching condition is\nsatisfied and/or the accretion rate is enhanced, then conical\nwinds are expected. It is possible that the jet component is\nalso powerful enough in this state so as to produce the fast\njet component that is observed. Additional simulations are\nneeded for better understanding of outflows in this important\nstate.\n\n8.1.3\n\nPeriods of enhanced accretion and outflows in EXors\n\nEXors represent an interesting stage of evolution of young\nstars where the accretion rate is strongly enhanced and powerful outflows are observed (e.g., Coffey, Downes & Ray 2004;\nLorenzetti et al. 2006; Brittain et al. 2007). Brittain et al.\n(2007) reported on the outflow of warm gas from the inner\ndisk around EXor V1647, observed in the blue absorption of\nthe CO line during the decline of the EXor activity. They concluded that this outflow is a continuation of activity associated with early enhanced accretion and bunching of the magnetic field lines (see Fig. 25). The EXor stage may correspond\nto the initial stage of our simulations, during which a signif-\n\n\f20\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\n\nFigure 22. A dimensional example of matter flow in the protostar regime shown in Fig. 9. Time T = 1400 corresponds to 3.8 years. Labels show\nthe particles density n in units of 1/cm3 and the poloidal velocity vp . Azimuthal velocity is a few times larger that the poloidal velocity in the\nbeginning of the flow, but decreases at larger distances (see Fig. 9).\n\nicant amount of matter comes into the region. Or, it is more\nprobable that initially there is weak outflow at the level of that\nin CTTSs, but later the accretion rate increases by a few orders\nof magnitude, leading to a powerful outburst which produces\nconical winds. For conversion into dimensional values, we\nsuggest that the disk comes close to the stellar surface, which\nis at r = 1 (as opposed to 0.5 in the previous examples), and\nthe disk stops much closer to the star\n\u221a(rm = 1.2R\u2217 ). Then all\nvelocities are higher by a factor of 2 \u2248 1.4, densities by a\nfactor of 32, and matter fluxes by a factor of 11 than in the\nmain example relevant to CTTSs.\n\n8.1.4\n\nOutflows from Brown Dwarfs\n\nRecently outflows were discovered from a few brown dwarfs\n(BDs) (e.g., Mohanty, Jayawardhana & Basri 2005; Whelan,\nRay & Bacciotti 2009). Clear signs of CTTS-like magnetospheric accretion (broad spectral lines with full-widths of\nv > 200 km/s) were reported earlier for a number of young\nBDs (e.g., Natta et al. 2004). BDs are fully or partially convective and the generation of a strong magnetic field is expected (Chabrier et al. 2007). Magnetic fields of the order of\n0.1 \u2212 3 kG may explain the observed properties of magnetospheric accretion (Reiners, Basri & Christensen 2009). Recently, radio pulses were discovered from the L dwarf binary\n2MASSW J0746425+200032 with period P \u2248 124 minutes,\nwhich point to a magnetic field of B \u2248 1.7 kG (Berger et\nal. 2009). The accretion rates in young BDs are smaller than\nin CTTS: \u1e40 = 10\u221211 \u2212 10\u22129 M /yr, and are often strongly\nvariable. For example, in 2MASSW J1207334-393254, \u1e40 varied by a factor of 5 \u2212 10 during a 6\u2212 week period (Scholz,\nJayawardhana & Brandeker 2005). We suggest that outflows\nmay form in BDs during periods of enhanced accretion or in\nthe propeller regime if the BD is rapidly rotating.\nAs an example we consider a BD with mass MBD =\n60MJ = 0.056M , radius RBD = 0.1R , and surface magnetic field BBD = 2 kG and obtain the reference parameters\nshown in the Table 1. The period of the star is another independent parameter. Here we suggest rcor = 2 which cor-\n\nresponds to P\u2217 = 0.13 days, which is a typical period for a\nBD. We also suggest that in Fig. 3 the star's radius is r = 0.5,\nthat is, the disk is truncated at rm = 1.2/0.5 = 2.4R\u2217 . For\nthese parameters we obtain an accretion rate of \u1e40BD \u2248\n1.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 M /yr. For a smaller magnetic field, B = 1kG,\nthe same truncation radius will correspond to a smaller accretion rate \u1e40BD \u2248 4.6 \u00d7 10\u221211 M /yr. The reference velocity v0 = 210 km/s is not different from the CTTSs case, and\ntherefore the poloidal velocity of matter in the conical wind\nis vp . (40 \u2212 60) km/s. The higher-velocity component of the\noutflow, vp \u223c 200 km/s, can be easily explained if the BD is in\nthe propeller regime. It is also possible that in the rotational\nequilibrium state the jet component is strong enough to drive\njets.\n8.2\n8.2.1\n\nApplication to Compact Stars\nSymbiotic stars - white-dwarf hosting binaries\n\nOutflows are observed in some white-dwarf hosting systems.\nOne class of them is the symbiotic stars (SSs). SSs are binary stars in which a white dwarf orbits a red giant star\nand captures material from the wind of the red giant. Collimated outflows have been observed from more than 10 (out\nof \u223c 200) symbiotic binaries. Most of them are transient and\nappear during or after an optical outburst that indicates an\nenhanced accretion rate (Sokoloski 2003). If SSs have a magnetic field then enhanced accretion may drive conical-type\noutflows from the disk-magnetosphere boundary during periods of enhanced accretion. The possibility of a magnetic field\nB \u2248 6\u00d7106 G in the SS Z And is discussed by Sokoloski & Bildsten (1999) where flickering with a definite frequency was\nobserved. In other SSs the magnetic field has not been estimated, but present observations do not rule it out (Sokoloski\n2003). The flickering in many SSs does not show a definite\nperiod, but the presence of a weak magnetic field is not excluded (Sokoloski, Bildsten & Ho 2000). For a typical SSs accretion rate of \u1e40 \u2248 10\u22128 M /yr, a magnetic field as small as\nB \u223c 3 \u00d7 104 G will be dynamically important for the diskstar interaction. Thus it is possible that outflows are launched\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n\n21\n\nfrom the vicinity of the SS as accretion-driven conical winds.\nCollimation may be connected with a disk wind, disk magnetic flux and/or the interstellar medium as discussed in \u00a75.3.\n\n8.2.2\n\nCircinus X-1 - the neutron-star hosting binary\n\nCircinus X-1 represents one of a few cases where a jet is seen\nfrom the vicinity of an accreting neutron star. The system is\nunusual because Type I X-ray bursts as well as twin-peak Xray QPOs are observed. The neutron star is estimated to have\na weak magnetic field (Boutloukos et al. 2006). The binary\nsystem has a high eccentricity (e \u223c 0.4 \u2212 0.9) and thus has\nperiods of low and high accretion rates (e.g., Murdin 1980).\nTwo-component outflows are observed. Radio observations\nshow a non-stationary jet with a small opening angle on both\narcminute and arcsecond scales. At the same time spectroscopic observations in the optical (Jonker et al. 2007) and\nX-ray bands (Iaria et al. 2008) show that outflows have a conical structure with a half-opening angle of about 30\u25e6 . Different explanations are possible for this conical structure, such\nas precession of a jet (Iaria et al. 2008). However, this appears less likely because the axis of the jet has not changed\nin the last 10 years (Tudose et al. 2008). This neutron star\nmay be a good candidate for conical winds, because (1) it has\nepisodes of very low and very high accretion rates, and (2)\na neutron star has only a weak magnetic field which can be\nstrongly compressed by the disk, favouring the formation of\nconical winds. Table 1 shows possible parameters for neutron\nstars. Episodic collimated radio jets are also observed from the\nneutron-star hosting system Sco X-1 (Fomalont, Geldzahler, &\nBradshaw 2001).\n\n8.2.3\n\nApplication to black-hole hosting systems\n\nJets and winds are observed from accreting black holes (BHs)\nincluding both stellar-mass BHs and BHs in galactic nuclei.\nThe correlation between enhanced accretion rate and outflows has been discussed extensively, and observational data\nare in favor of this correlation (e.g. Livio 1997). Recently, a\nconical-shaped ionized outflow was discovered in the blackhole hosting X-Ray Binary LMC X-1 (Cooke et al. 2008). It\nis not known what determines its shape, but the formation\nof conical winds is a possibility. Magnetic flux accumulation\nin the inner disk around the black hole was discussed by\nLovelace et al. (1994) and Meier (2005) and observed in numerical simulations (Igumenshchev, Narayan, & Abramowicz\n2003; Igumenshchev 2008). Implosive accretion and outflows\nfrom black-hole hosting systems were analyzed by Lovelace et\nal. (1994) where angular momentum flows from the disk into\na magnetic disk wind, leading to a global magnetic instability\nand strongly enhanced accretion. An accretion disk around\na black hole may have an ordered magnetic field or loops\nthreading the disk and corona. Fast accretion may lead to\nbunching of all field lines and possibly to conical winds. The\ninward advection of a large scale weak magnetic field threading a turbulent disk is strongly enhanced because the surface layers of the disk are non-turbulent and highly conducting (Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Lovelace 2007; Rothstein & Lovelace\n2008). The mechanism of conical winds probably does not require a special magnetic field configuration (such as a dipole).\nMohanty and Shu (2008) have shown that the X-wind model\n\nFigure 23. Examples of HE I \u03bb10830 residual profiles and corresponding 1\u03bc veiling, r\u03b3 , for 6 accreting CTTSs. The upper row shows\nhigh veiling objects with P Cygni profiles characterized by deep and\nbroad blue absorption which is a sign of the high-velocity outflow.\nThe lower row shows low veiling objects with narrow blue absorption which is a sign of a low-velocity outflow. The latter also show\nred absorption from magnetospheric infall (from Edwards 2009).\n\nFigure 24. Modeling of the H\u03b2 line in RW Aurigae led to the conclusion that a cone-shaped wind with half-opening angle 30 \u2212 40\u25e6 and a\nnarrow annulus gives the best match to the observations of this line\n(from Alencar et al. 2005).\n\nworks when the star has a complex magnetic field configuration (see also Donati et al. 2006; Long, Romanova & Lovelace\n2007, 2008).\n\n9\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have obtained long-lasting outflows of cold disk matter\ninto a hot low-density corona from the disk-magnetosphere\nboundary in cases of slowly and rapidly rotating stars. The\nmain results are the following:\nSlowly rotating stars (not in the propeller regime): 1. A\nnew type of outflow - a conical wind - has been found and\nstudied in our simulations. Matter flows out forming a conical\nwind which has the shape of a thin conical shell with a halfopening angle \u03b8 \u223c 30\u25e6 . The outflows appear in cases where\nthe magnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the disk into\nan X-type configuration. We find that this occurs when the\nturbulent magnetic Prandtl number (the ratio of viscosity to\ndiffusivity) Prm > 1, and when the viscosity is sufficiently\nhigh, \u03b1v & 0.03. In earlier simulations of funnel accretion\n(e.g., R02; Romanova et al. 2003; Long et al. 2005) both vis-\n\n\f22\n\nM. M. Romanova et al.\nPropeller-driven outflows appear around rapidly rotating\nstars for conditions where rm > rcor and where the condition for bunching, Prm > 1, is satisfied. Their properties are\nthe following:\n1. Two distinct outflow components are found in the propeller\nregime: (1) a relatively low-velocity conical wind and (2) a\nhigh-velocity axial jet.\n\nFigure 25. Schematic model of an Exor V1647 Ori. During the outburst the accretion rate is enhanced, and the magnetospheric radius\nrm decreases and the magnetic field lines are bunched up (A). This\nresults in a fast, hot outflow. As the accretion rate decreases, the\ndisk moves outward and this results in a slower, cooler CO outflow\n(B). Further decrease in the accretion rate leads to a quiescent state\nwhere the production of warm outflows stops (C). From Brittain et\nal. (2007)\n\ncosity and diffusivity were small and of the same order, and\nbunching of the magnetic field did not occur.\n2. The matter in the conical winds rotates with Keplerian velocity vK at the base of the wind and continues to rotate\nhigher up. It gradually accelerates to poloidal velocities of\nvp \u223c 0.5vK . The conical wind is driven by the magnetic force\nwhich acts upwards and towards the axis. This is responsible for the small opening angle of the cone, the narrow shell\nshape of the flow, and the gradual collimation of conical wind\ntowards the axis inside the simulation region.\n3. Conical winds form around stars with different, including\nvery low, rotation rates. The amount of matter flowing into\nthe conical wind depends on a number of parameters, but\nin many cases it is \u1e40w \u223c (10 \u2212 30)%\u1e40d . It increases with\nthe rotation rate of the star and reaches almost 100% in the\npropeller regime. For rapidly rotating stars the outflows become strongly non-stationary. The period between outbursts\nincreases with the spin of the star.\n4. There is another component of the outflow: a low-density,\nhigh-velocity component of gas flowing along the stellar field\nlines. The volume occupied by this component increases with\nthe rotation rate of the star. It occupies the entire region interior to the conical wind in the propeller regime.\n5. A major part of the disk matter accretes to the star through\nthe funnel flow and spins the star up. The conical winds carry\naway part of the disk angular momentum, but most of it is\ntransported radially outward by the viscous stress.\n6. Conical winds can be further collimated at larger distances\nby the pressure of the surrounding medium (Lovelace et al.\n1991), disk winds (e.g. Fendt 2009), or by the magnetic flux\nthreading the disk at large distances (e.g., Matt et al. 2003).\n7. Conical winds may appear during strong enhancements of\naccretion, as in EXors or symbiotic variables. At the same time\nour simulations indicate that relatively steady outflows can\nexist for a long time (2 years in application to young stars)\nif the conditions for the magnetic field bunching are maintained.\n8. Exploratory 3D simulations of conical winds from accreting stars with a significantly misaligned dipole field show that\nthe conical winds are approximately symmetric about the rotational axis of the star (and the disk).\n\n2. A significant part of the disk matter and angular momentum flows into the conical winds. At the same time a significant part of the rotational energy of the star flows into the\nmagnetically-dominated axial jet. Formation of powerful jets\nis expected. This regime is particularly relevant to protostars,\nwhere the star rotates rapidly and has a high accretion rate.\n3. The star spins down rapidly due to the angular momentum\nflow into the axial jet along the field lines connecting the star\nand the corona. For typical parameters a protostar spins down\nin 3 \u00d7 105 years. The axial jet is powered by the spin-down of\nthe star rather than by disk accretion.\n4. The matter fluxes into both components (wind and jet)\nstrongly oscillate due to events of inflation and reconnection.\nMost powerful outbursts occur every 1 \u2212 2 months. The interval between outbursts is expected to be longer for smaller\ndiffusivities in the disk. Outbursts are accompanied by higher\noutflow velocities and stronger self-collimation of both components. Such outbursts may explain the ejection of knots in\nsome CTTSs every few months. Enhanced accretion due to external factors will also lead to formation of a new blob/knot\nin the jet.\nThe values of the transport coefficients \u03b1v and \u03b1d in realistic accretion disks remain uncertain, but it is widely thought\nthat they are due to Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI)driven turbulence (Balbus & Hawley 1998). MRI simulations\nsuggest that the turbulence may give values of \u03b1 in the range:\n\u03b1v = 10\u22122 \u2212 0.4 (e.g., Stone et al. 2000).\nIf in actual accretion disks the transport coefficients are\nlarge, \u03b1 \u223c 0.1, then strong outflows are expected during periods in which \u03b1v & \u03b1d , or when the accretion rate is enhanced. The condition for magnetic field bunching is that the\nmagnetic Prandtl number of the turbulence Pr= \u03b1v /\u03b1d > 1.\nThe effective Prandtl number may be significantly increased\nowing to the highly conducting surface layer of the disk\n(Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Lovelace 2007; Rothstein & Lovelace\n2008). The field lines may be bunched up not only due to\nhigh viscosity, but also by many other processes, e.g., due to\nthermal or magnetic instabilities, or due to the Rossby wave\nmechanism (Lovelace et al. 1999; Li et al. 2000). If the transport coefficients are very small, say \u03b1v \u2248 \u03b1d = 0.01, then\nquasi-stationary accretion through a funnel flow (with no outflows) is expected (R02; Long et al. 2005). If the star rotates\nrapidly, it will be in the weak propeller regime in which a star\nspins down, but no outflows are produced, Romanova et al.\n2004a). If at some point the accretion rate is enhanced due\nto one or another mechanism, then conical winds will form in\nspite of the diffusivity being small.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank S.

The stress tensor\nTik = Tik + \u03c4ik consists of an ideal part,\nTik = \u03c1vi vk + p\u03b4ik +\n\nBi Bk\nB2\n\u03b4ik \u2212\n,\n8\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\nand a viscous part \u03c4ik which takes into account small-scale\nturbulent velocity and magnetic field fluctuations.\nWe assume that the stress due to the turbulent fluctuations can be represented in the same way as the collisional\nviscosity by substitution of the turbulent viscosity coefficient\ninto it. Moreover, we consider that the viscous stress is determined mainly by the gradient of the angular velocity because\nthe azimuthal velocity is the dominant component in the disk.\nThe dominant components of the tensor \u03c4ik in spherical coordinates are:\n\u03c4r\u03c6 = \u2212\u03bdt \u03c1r sin \u03b8\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n,\n\u2202r\n\n\u03c4\u03b8\u03c6 = \u2212\u03bdt \u03c1 sin \u03b8\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n.\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\nHere \u03a9 = v\u03c6 /r sin \u03b8 is angular velocity of the plasma and \u03bdt\nis the kinematic turbulent viscosity.\nSeparating out the viscous stress in the \u03c6 component of\neqn.

In both types of runs (propeller\nand conical winds) we have neglected viscous heating. We\nhave also neglected radiative cooling. Inclusion of heating\nand cooling is a separate and complex physics problem which\nis different for different types of stars. We suggest that the\nviscous heating is compensated by radiative cooling. Thus,\nthe main \"role\" of viscous terms is the transport of angular\nmomentum outward which allows matter to accrete inward\nto the disk-magnetosphere boundary.\nWe also assume that the plasma has a finite magnetic diffusivity. That is, the matter may diffuse across the field lines.\nWe assume that the finite diffusivity of the plasma is also due\nto the small-scale turbulent fluctuations of the velocity and\nthe magnetic field. The induction equation averaged over the\nsmall-scale fluctuations has the form\n\u2202B\n\u2212 \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 B) + c\u2207 \u00d7 E\u2020 = 0 .\n(A2)\n\u2202t\nHere, v and B are the averaged velocity and magnetic fields,\nand E\u2020 = \u2212 hv0 \u00d7 B0 i /c is electromotive force connected\nwith the fluctuating fields. Because the turbulent electromotive force E\u2020 is connected with the small-scale fluctuations, it\nis reasonable to suppose that it has a simple relation to the\nordered magnetic field B. If we neglect the magnetic dynamo\n\u03b1-effect (Moffat 1978), then hv0 \u00d7 B0 i = \u2212\u03b7t \u2207 \u00d7 B, where\n\u03b7t is the coefficient of turbulent magnetic diffusivity.

However, we observed that although this\nterm led to some heating, it was not the reason for the production the outflows in the propeller regime. Test simulations\nwith no heating led to similar outflows, because the main\ndriving forces are magneto-centrifugal forces. In the conical\nwind simulations we did not include Joule heating. Therefore\nwe suggest that both Joule and viscous heating are exactly\ncompensated by the radiative cooling.\n\nAPPENDIX B: NUMERICAL METHOD\n\nFor numerical integration of the MHD equations including\nthe magnetic diffusivity and viscosity in the disk, we used a\nmethod of splitting of the different physical processes. Our\nsimulation algorithm has a number of blocks: (1) an \"ideal\nMHD\" block in which we calculate the dynamics of the plasma\nand magnetic field with dissipative processes switched off;\nblocks (2) and (3) for the diffusion of the poloidal and\nazimuthal components of the magnetic field calculated for\nfrozen values of the plasma velocity and thermodynamic parameters (density and pressure); and block (4) for the calculation of viscous dissipation in which we took into account\nonly the r\u03c6 and \u03b8\u03c6 components of the viscous stress tensor.\n(1) In the hydrodynamic block, the ideal MHD equa\u2202B\ntions\nare integrated numerically using an explicit conserva\u2212 \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 B) + \u2207 \u00d7 (\u03b7t \u2207 \u00d7 B) = 0 .\n(A3)\n\u2202t\ntive Godunov-type numerical scheme.

Equation (A5) is approximated\nby an implicit difference scheme. The approximation is chosen so that the operator on the implicit time-layer is symmetric and positive. For solving the system of equations on the\nimplicit time-layer, we used ICCG (Incomplete Cholesky Conjugate Gradient) method (Kershaw 1978). Because the size of\nthe grid cells and the coefficient of magnetic diffusivity vary\nstrongly in space, the elements of the matrix of the system\nalso vary strongly. To remove this undesirable property, we\nchanged the matrix so that it has diagonal elements equal to\nunity.\n(3) In the block where the diffusion of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is calculated, we numerically integrate equation (A6). At the inner and outer boundaries, B\u03c6\nis frozen in this computational block. Along the rotation axis\nand on the equatorial plane B\u03c6 = 0. Equation (A6) was approximated by a numerical scheme with a symmetric positive\noperator on the implicit time layer. The corresponding system\nof linear equations is solved by the ICCG method.\n(4) In the block where the viscous stress is calculated, we\nintegrate equation (A1) numerically for the angular velocity\nof matter \u03a9 = v\u03c6 /r sin \u03b8. At the inner boundary of the simulation region we take \u03a9 = \u03a9\u2217 , the angular rotation velocity\nof the star. At the outer boundary, \u03a9 is taken to be fixed and\nequal to the corresponding Keplerian value. On the axis and\nin the equatorial plane we have the condition of zero stress for\nthe \u03b8\u03c6 -component of the viscous stress tensor. Equation (A1)\nis approximated by a numerical scheme with a symmetric positive operator on the implicit time-layer. The corresponding\nsystem of linear equations is solved by the ICCG method.\nThe code has passed all the standard tests. In addition\nit has been used for the solution of a number of important astrophysical MHD flow problems (e.g., Ustyugova et al.\n1999; R02; R05; U06). In one problem, stationary super-fastmagnetosonic MHD outflows were obtained for the first time\nwith the disk treated as a boundary condition (Ustyugova et\nal. 1999). In that work all of the flux function integrals of\nmotion were calculated from the simulations and found to\nbe constant as required by the theory (e.g., Lovelace et al.\n1986). Additionally, the cross-field force balance was checked\nnumerically. Subsequently, similar results were obtained by\nKrasnopolsky et al. (1999) using the ZEUS code. This test of\nthe simulations against the axisymmetric MHD theory is an\nimportant test in that it involves all three components of the\nflow velocity and the magnetic field. Simulation results of accretion to a star with a dipole field (R02; Long et al. 2005)\nwere recently confirmed by Bessolaz et al. (2008).\n\nAPPENDIX C: TESTS OF THE CODE\nWe performed multiple tests of the code with different grids.\nWe plan to describe the whole set of tests in a separate paper. However, in Appendix B we show two tests relevant to\nthe ideal and diffusive blocks of the code. Below we show\ntwo examples of such tests. In the first test we checked the\nideal MHD block of the code (with viscosity and diffusivity\nswitched off). In the second test we checked the diffusion\nblock of the code separately.\n\nC1\n\nTest of the ideal MHD block\n\nTo check the MHD block of the code we performed the standard \"rotor problem\" test. This test has been used by a number of authors for testing MHD solvers including the energy\nequation (e.g., Balsara & Spicer 1999). We use this test to\ncheck our ideal MHD block of the code (viscosity and diffusivity are switched off) with an isentropic equation dS/dt = 0 instead of the energy equation. In this situation the shock waves\ndo not have physical sense. However, the goal of this test is\nnot to test the physics of shock waves, but instead to demonstrate the ability of the numerical algorithm to solve the 2D\nadiabatic MHD equations.\nWe solve the MHD equations numerically in the region\n\u22120.5 < x < 0.5, \u22120.5 < y < 0.5 in a Cartesian geometry. At\nthe beginning of simulations, t = 0, the pressure in the region\nis constant, p = 1, and the magnetic field is homogeneous,\nBx = 0, By = 5. In p\nthe center there is a circle with radius\nr0 = 0.1 (radius r = x2 + y 2 ) where the density of matter\nis \u03c10 = 10 and the matter rotates as a solid body with angular\nvelocity \u03c90 = 20. At r > r1 = 0.115, the density is \u03c11 = 1 and\nthe matter is at rest. In the ring r0 < r < r1 , the density and\nvelocity are linearly interpolated between those at r = r0 and\nr = r1 .\nThe equations of ideal adiabatic MHD were solved with\nthe Godunov-type scheme used in the \"main\" code. In the test\nwe used a homogeneous grid with step \u2206x = \u2206y = 1/N ,\nwhere N = 100, 200, 400. The time-step is chosen from the\ncondition \u2206t = 0.4\u2206x/vmax , where vmax is the maximum\nvelocity of propagation of the perturbations. The results of\nthe simulations are shown in Fig. C1. One can see that the\ndensity and the field line distribution is very similar in all\nthree cases, while simulations at the highest grid resolutions\ngive almost identical results and the convergence of the results is evident. The bottom panels of Fig. C1 show selected\nstreamlines with numbers which confirm the similarity and\nconvergence of the results. The test had been performed on a\nhomogeneous grid, while our simulations were done in spherical coordinates with a high grid resolution near the star, and\nmuch coarser resolution at the outer boundary of the simulation region. In this paper we mainly investigate the launching of jets and winds from the disk, and therefore we need\nto have adequate grid resolution in the region where matter is launched from the disk into the winds, that is, at radii\nr \u2248 2\u22123 for the conical winds, and r \u2248 3\u22125 for the propellerdriven winds. The grid resolution at these radii corresponds\napproximately to the homogeneous grid with the lowest grid\nresolution, 100 \u00d7 100. The above test shows that the grid resolution in this region is sufficiently good for investigation of\nthe physics of outflows in this region. It is clear that the grid\nresolution at larger distances, and in particular close to the\nouter boundary is not very high. However, this region does\nnot influence the physics of the process. In this region matter flows either inward due to the viscosity (in the disk), or\noutward as winds (in the corona). We expect larger simulation errors in these regions, but these do not change the main\nresult: the launching of winds from the disk-magnetosphere\nboundary. The magnetic force accelerating matter into the jet\ncomponent has higher accuracy close to the star and less accuracy at larger distances. However, Fig. 11d shows that the\nmain acceleration into the wind occurs close to the star where\nthe grid resolution is good.\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n\n27\n\nFigure C1.

For this we\n\"switch off\" the hydrodynamic fluxes and the corresponding right-hand side terms in equations A5 and A6 and integrate these equations numerically in the region r0 < r < r1 ,\n0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2. In the case of the constant diffusivity coefficient (we take \u03b7 = 1) equations A5 and A6 coincide, and\nso the problems for the azimuthal component of the vectorpotential and for the azimuthal magnetic field differ only in\nthe boundary conditions at the equator (at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2) and the\ninitial conditions. That is,\n \u0328\n \u0328\n \u0328\n \u0328\n\u2202A\u03c6  \u0328\n \u0328\n= 0, B\u03c6  \u0328\n= 0.\n \u0328\n \u0328\n\u2202\u03b8  \u0328\n\u03b8=\u03c0/2\n\n\u03b8=\u03c0/2\n\nOn the symmetry axis (\u03b8 = 0) we have:\nA\u03c6 |\u03b8=0 = 0, B\u03c6 |\u03b8=0 = 0.\n\nWe can find some particular solutions of equations (A5) and\n(A6) by the separation of variables method. For testing we\nchoose the following solutions:\n!\n!\n10\u03b7(t0 \u2212 t)\nC sin \u03b8\n5 sin 2\u03b8\nA\u03c6 =\n1\u2212\n1+\n,\n(C1)\nr2\n4\nr2\n!\n6\u03b7(t0 \u2212 t)\nC sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\nB\u03c6 =\n1+\n,\n(C2)\nr\nr2\nwhere C and t0 are constants. Equations for the \u03c6components of the vector-potential and magnetic field were\nintegrated numerically using our 2.5D code (with the\n\"switched-off\" hydro fluxes and zero right-hand-side terms).\nWe used the same grid geometry as in the main simulations;\nthat is, spherical coordinates with an equidistant grid in the\nmeridional direction and expanding grid in the radial direction, where the expansion factor is determined by the fact that\nwe keep all sides of each grid cell to be approximately equal.\nFor the test we used the grid corresponding to the main simulation runs in the conical wind, Nr = 51 and N\u03b8 = 31, and\nalso we used finer grids, 75 \u00d7 45 and 101 \u00d7 61. We took the inner and outer radii of the simulation region to be the same as\nin the conical wind case, r0 = 1, r1 = 15.9. For these boundaries we set A\u03c6 and B\u03c6 to be equal to the analytical values\ndetermined by equations C1 and C2. The initial conditions\ncorresponded to the exact solutions (C1 and C2) at t = 0.\nThe constants C and t0 in C1 and C2 were chosen so that\nthe solutions at the inner boundary are of the order of unity.\nWe used C = 0.01, t0 = 50. We integrated the equations up\nto t1 = 2t0 = 100.\nFig. C2 (top panels) shows the result of the diffusivity test\nfor the vector-potential, A\u03c6 .

The dashed line shows\nthe exact solution, Aexact\n, obtained by integrating the exact\n\u03c6\nsolution C1. One can see that the solutions are very close to\neach other, and the dashed line is barely visible. The mid.\n\u2212 Aexact\ndle panel shows the absolute error \u2206A\u03c6 = Anum\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nOne can see that the error is very small everywhere, taking\ninto account the fact that the maximum value of the function, A\u03c6 \u2248 1. The error increases towards the star. However,\nthis is because the value of the function A\u03c6 strongly increases\ntowards the star. The right hand panel shows that the relative error, (Anum\n\u2212 Aexact\n)/Aexact\n, decreases towards the\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nstar. One can see that the relative error in calculation of the\ndiffusivity is also small and is of the order of (1 \u2212 2)%. Fig.\nC2 (bottom panels) shows similar analysis for the B\u03c6 component, where equations (A6) and C2 have been solved for the\nnumerical and exact solutions.\nWe performed similar simulations and analysis at finer\ngrid resolutions, 75 \u00d7 45 and 101 \u00d7 61. Table 2 shows the\nmaximum absolute error, max |Anum\n\u2212 Aexact\n|. One can see\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nthat at the finer grids, 75 \u00d7 45 and 101 \u00d7 61, this error is 2.1\nand 3.9 times smaller compared to the coarsest grid, 51 \u00d7 31.\nThis confirms the convergence of the numerical solution towards the analytical solution. Similar comparisons for the B\u03c6\ncomponent give factors 2.2 and 4.1, which also show convergence.\nA complete description of our methods and tests will be\ngiven in a separate paper.\n\nAPPENDIX D: PARAMETER RANGES OF CONICAL WINDS\nTo investigate the dependence on different parameters we\ntook the main case and varied one parameter at a time. We\nperformed several sets of runs: (1) with a fixed diffusivity and\ndifferent viscosity coefficients; (2) with a fixed viscosity and\ndifferent diffusivity coefficients; (3) with different rotation\nperiods of the star P\u2217 ; (4) with different coronal densities.\n\nD1\n\nDependence on viscosity at fixed diffusivity\n\nWe fixed the diffusivity at \u03b1d = 0.1 and varied the viscosity\ncoefficient in the range \u03b1v = 0.01 \u2212 1. Fig. D1 shows matter\nfluxes onto the star and into the conical winds through the\nsurface r = 6. We observed that for small viscosity, \u03b1v < 0.1,\nthe magnetic field of the dipole diffuses through the inner regions of the incoming disk and an X-type configuration does\nnot form. No conical winds appear in this case. We conclude\nthat formation of conical winds requires \u03b1v & \u03b1d , that is,\nPrm & 1. Next we increased \u03b1v and observed that an X-type\nconfiguration formed and conical winds were generated. We\nobserved that the accretion rate to the star increases with \u03b1v ,\nwhile the mass outflow rate into the conical winds increases\nbut only slowly. For \u03b1v = 0.1, the matter fluxes onto the star\nand into the wind are small and approximately equal. For\n\u03b1v = 0.3 and \u03b1v = 0.4, the wind carries about 30% and 20%\nof mass respectively. The angular momentum carried to the\nstar also strongly increases with \u03b1v . In all cases the star spins\nup, because the magnetospheric radius, rm \u2248 1.2 is smaller\n\n\fLaunching of Conical Winds\n\nFigure D1. Matter and angular momentum fluxes onto the star and\ninto the wind for fixed diffusivity \u03b1d = 0.1 but different coefficients\nof viscosity, \u03b1v .\n\na star rotates more rapidly, the winds become more powerful,\nand the accretion rate to the star decreases, and therefore the\nsituation becomes closer to the propeller regime. In rapidly\nrotating stars, the outbursts become episodic, and the interval\nbetween outbursts increases with spin. In addition, the volume occupied by the fast coronal component increases with\nspin: at rcor = 10 there is no fast component in the corona,\nat rcor = 3 it occupies some region above the conical winds\n(see Fig. 7a), while at rcor = 2 it occupies a much larger region (see Fig. 7b). At even higher spin this region occupies\nthe whole simulation region as in the propeller regime.\nD4\n\nFigure D2. Matter and angular momentum fluxes onto the star and\ninto the wind for fixed viscosity \u03b1v = 0.3 but different coefficients of\ndiffusivity, \u03b1d .\n\nthan corotation radius rcor = 3. That is, the incoming matter\nbrings positive angular momentum onto the star. The conical\nwind carries angular momentum away from the disk. Notice,\nhowever, that this is only a small part of the total angular\nmomentum of the disk as shown above.\nD2\n\nDependence on diffusivity at fixed viscosity\n\nIn the next set of runs we fixed the viscosity at \u03b1v = 0.3\nand varied the diffusivity: from 0.01 to 1. Fig. D2 shows\nthe integrated matter fluxes onto the star and into the wind\nat different diffusivities. We observed that no conical winds\nwere formed for \u03b1d & \u03b1v . At relatively high diffusivity,\n\u03b1d = 0.1, 0.3, about 30% of the incoming matter flows into\nthe conical wind. For \u03b1d = 0.1 (Prm = 3), the matter flux into\nthe conical wind oscillates, while at \u03b1d = 0.3 (Prm = 1) no\noscillations are observed. The conical wind also forms for very\nsmall diffusivity, \u03b1d = 0.01, but with slightly smaller matter\nflux into the wind. Angular momentum fluxes to the star and\ninto the winds are approximately the same, excluding the case\n\u03b1d = 0.01 where the flux to the star is larger.\nD3\n\nVariation of star's period\n\nWe varied the period of the star (via the corotation radius)\ntaking rcor = 3, 10 for slowly rotating stars and rcor =\n1.0, 1.5, 2 for more rapidly rotating stars. In the case of very\nslow rotation, rcor = 10, conical winds form and the outflow rate into the wind is similar to that in the main case\n(rcor = 3), although the accretion rate onto the star is somewhat larger. In stars with higher spin, rcor = 2, the amplitude\nof variability increases and the matter flux into the outflows\nincreases up to 50% of the accretion rate to the star. For even\nhigher spin, rcor = 1.5, the accretion rate to the star decreases\nby a factor of 5 compared with the main case, while the outflow rate into the conical wind strongly increases. Thus when\n\n29\n\nVariation of coronal density\n\nOutflow of matter into a wind occurs if the corona is not very\ndense, and hence outflowing matter of the winds does not\nlose its energy while propagating through the corona. In the\nmain simulation runs the initial density of the corona is 104\ntimes lower compared to the disk density ( \u03c1c = 10\u22123 versus \u03c1d = 10). To test the dependence on the coronal density\nwe decreased its density by a factor of 3. These simulations\nshowed that the matter fluxes onto the star and into the winds\nare not appreciably different from the main case. We conclude\nthat the coronal density used in the main case is sufficiently\nsmall not to affect the outflows.\nThe situation is different in the coronal region. For slowly\nrotating stars (the conical wind regime) there are no forces\nwhich tend to drive matter along the axis. Fast flow appears\nonly in the part of corona where the stellar field lines are\nstrongly inclined (see Fig. 3, Fig. 7). The rest of the corona\nhas very slow motion towards or away from the star. The top\nhalf of the coronal region is matter-dominated (Fig. 13a,d)\nand might be an obstacle to a fast outflow. We suggest that\nat lower coronal density the fast coronal component might\noccupy a larger region.\nIn the propeller regime where the star rotates rapidly, the\nmagnetic force is larger and drives the low-density coronal\nmatter into the fast jet. The corona is magnetically-dominated\n(see Fig. 16a,d) during the whole simulation time. Initially,\nthe density in the corona \u03c1c = 10\u22124 is 10 times lower than\nin case of slowly rotating stars. However, the initial density\ndistribution is important only at the beginning of the long\nsimulation runs. Later the density distribution is established\nby the outflow process. The main process is inflation of the\ndipole field lines. Inflating field lines carry matter along both\ndisk and stellar field lines, and as a result, some matter penetrates into the corona. Strong disk oscillations and violent\nprocesses of inflation during which the conical wind component often changes its opening angle) lead to the penetration\nof a small amount of matter into the corona. The density increases away from the axis, where it is very small, towards the\nconical wind. In the case of a slowly rotating star, the disk oscillations are weaker and there are no violent inflation events.\nFor this reason the axial region above the star has a very low\ndensity.\n\n\f"}
