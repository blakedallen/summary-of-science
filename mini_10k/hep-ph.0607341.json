After a very short epoch, when the temperature of the compact\nstar is of the order of \u223c 1011 K and neutrinos are trapped in the stellar core [2], the temperature drops and neutrinos\nare able to escape. However, even for smaller temperatures, e.g. below 109 K, the direct nuclear Urca processes\nn \u2192 p + e + \u03bd\u0304e and e\u2212 + p \u2192 n + \u03bde , which would produce rapid cooling, are not kinematically allowed, because\nenergy and momentum cannot be simultaneously conserved. Therefore only modified Urca processes can take place,\nwhere a bystander particle, present in the reaction, allows energy-momentum conservation. The resulting cooling is\nless rapid because neutrino emission rates turn out to be \u03b5\u03bd \u223c T 8 , much smaller than the emission rate \u03b5\u03bd \u223c T 6 due\nto direct Urca processes.\nThese considerations apply to stars containing only nuclear matter. If hadronic densities in the core of neutron\nstars are sufficiently large, the central region of the star should consist of deconfined quark matter [3] (we do not\nconsider the case of pure quark stars, see e.g. [4]). Therefore direct Urca processes involving quarks, i.e. the processes\nd \u2192 u + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e and u + e\u2212 \u2192 d + \u03bde , may take place and largely contribute to the cooling of the star. It has been\nshown by Iwamoto [5] that quark direct Urca processes are kinematically allowed and the corresponding emission rate\nfor massless quarks is of the order \u03b1s T 6 , where \u03b1s is the strong coupling constant. This result assumes that quark\nmatter is a normal Fermi liquid. However, since the temperature of aged compact stars is sufficiently low, deconfined\nquarks in the stellar core are likely to form Cooper pairs and quark matter could be in one of the possible Color\nSuperconductive (CS) phases (see [6], [7] and for reviews [8]). This is due to the fact that the critical temperature of\nCS matter is of the order of dozens MeV, well above the estimated temperature of the stellar core . 100 KeV.\nAt asymptotically high densities the energetically favored CS phase is the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, in\nwhich light quarks of any color form Cooper pairs with zero total momentum [7], and all fermionic excitations are\ngapped. The corresponding neutrino emissivity and specific heat C are suppressed by a factor e\u2212\u2206/T , where \u2206 is\nthe quasiparticle gap in the CFL phase. Therefore the cooling of quark matter in the CFL phase is distinctly less\nrapid than in the normal phase. In the CFL phase quark masses can be neglected and color and electric neutrality\nconditions are automatically implemented. However at densities relevant for compact stars the quark number chemical\npotential \u03bc cannot be much larger than 500 MeV and effects due to the strange quark mass ms must be included.\nRequiring that bulk quark matter is in weak equilibrium and electrically and color neutral [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], together\nwith ms 6= 0, determines a mismatch \u03b4\u03bc between the Fermi momenta of different quarks, with \u03b4\u03bc depending on the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nroberto.anglani@ba.infn.it\ngiuseppe.nardulli@ba.infn.it\nmarco.ruggieri@ba.infn.it\nmassimo@lns.mit.edu\n\n\f2\nin-medium value of ms . For values of ms less than a critical value, CFL is the energetically favored phase. For larger\nvalues the CFL phase cannot be realized and quark matter should pair with a less symmetric pattern.\nThe ground state of quark matter in these conditions is still a matter of debate and several possible superconductive\nphases have been suggested (see [14] for a review). Recently two superconductive phases characterized by gapless\nfermionic excitations, i.e. the gapless-2SC (g2SC) phase [15] and the gapless-CFL (gCFL) phase [16, 17, 18] have\nbeen largely discussed. However, it has been shown [19, 20, 21, 22] that both are \"chromo-magnetically unstable\"\nbecause the Meissner masses of some of the gluons associated with broken gauge symmetries are imaginary.\nAnother possibility that has attracted theoretical attention is the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state\n[23, 24, 25, 26], where the total momentum of the pair does not vanish and counter propagating color currents are\nspontaneously generated. A simplified ansatz \"crystal\" structure with\nh\u03c8\u03b1i (x)C\u03b35 \u03c8\u03b2j (x)i \u221d\n\n3\nX\n\n\u2206I e2iqI *r \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2I \u01ebijI ,\n\n(1)\n\nI=1\n\n(i, j = 1, 2, 3 flavor indices, \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3 color indices) has been studied in Refs. [27, 28] and found energetically\nfavored with respect to the gCFL and the unpaired phases in a certain range of values of \u03b4\u03bc. In Eq. (1) 2 qI represents\nthe momentum of the Cooper pair and the gap parameters \u22061 , \u22062 , \u22063 describe respectively d \u2212 s, u \u2212 s and u \u2212 d\npairing. For sufficiently large \u03bc the energetically favored phase is characterized by \u22061 = 0, \u22062 = \u22063 and q2 = q3 .\nGluon Meissner masses corresponding to broken color generators have been evaluated in [29] and this phase results\nto be chromo-magnetically stable. More complex crystal structures have been recently proposed in [30]. From the\nevaluation of the corresponding free-energy in the Ginzburg-Landau approximation one finds that crystal structures\nwith more plane waves are energetically favored with respect to the normal phase and the gCFL phase in a wider\nrange of densities. We note that by (1) we assume attractiveness in the color antisymmetric channel. This follows\nfrom the one gluon exchange diagram of QCD. It dominates the asymptotic regime and we assume that it favors\nattraction also at moderate densities (\u03bc \u2243 500 MeV). In other words, though at moderate density nonperturbative\neffects can play a role we are assuming that the superconductive ground state is qualitatively similar to that of very\nhigh density.\nThe aim of the present paper is to evaluate the neutrino emission rate and the specific heat of quark matter in the\nLOFF superconductive phase. We show that, due to the existence of gapless modes in the LOFF phase, a neutron\nstar with a quark LOFF core cools faster than a star made by nuclear matter only. This follows from the fact that in\nthe LOFF phase neutrino emissivity and quark specific heat are parametrically similar to the case of unpaired quark\nmatter (\u03b5\u03bd \u223c T 6 and C \u223c T respectively). Therefore the cooling is similar to that of a star comprising unpaired\nquark matter. Incidentally we note that the dominance of quasiparticle gapless modes has been demonstrated also\nfor the g2SC phase [31] and for the gCFL phase [32], though in the latter phase the behavior of neutrino emissivity\nand quark specific heat is different (\u03b5\u03bd \u223c T 5.5 and C \u223c T 0.5 ). For calculation of neutrino emissivity in other models\nsee [33].\nOur results should be considered as preliminary, since, as we have already pointed out, the simple ansatz (1) should\nbe substituted by a more complex behavior as in [30]. If the condensate is the sum of more plane waves, the calculation\nof \u03b5\u03bd and C is more involved, basically because one should obtain information on the quasiparticle dispersion law\nin the framework of the Ginzburg Landau expansion. For complex condensate patterns resulting from several plane\nwaves this is a complicated task (a calculation for two flavors is in [34]) and we leave it as a future work. Given\nthese limitations it would be fruitless to consider sophisticated star models. Therefore we evaluate the cooling rate\nby employing toy models of stellar objects, i.e. stars made of nuclear matter with a core in the color superconductive\nLOFF phase. Also, we will not consider the contribution to the cooling of the compact star due to other processes\nsuch as the neutrino pair bremsstrahlung from nuclei in the crust and pionic reactions [35] that should also be included\nin a realistic description of the compact star cooling [1].\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section II we briefly discuss the LOFF phase characterized by the condensate\n(1). In Section III we evaluate the neutrino emissivity and in Section IV the specific heat in the LOFF phase. In\nSection V we evaluate the effect of 1/\u03bc corrections, taking into account the results of [36]. In Section VI we estimate the\ncooling rate of toy models of neutron stars. Given our approximations any comparison with experimental observation,\nsimilar e.g. to those already appeared in the literature [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], is premature and we limit our\nanalysis to a qualitative comparison among various simple models. In Section VII we draw our conclusions and in the\nAppendix we report the dispersion laws that are used to compute the quark mixing coefficients and gapless points in\nthe LOFF phase.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nNEUTRAL LOFF QUARK MATTER\n\nNon interacting quark matter consisting of massless u and d quarks and s quarks with an in-medium mass ms can\nbe described by the Lagrangian density\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n(2)\nL0 = \u03c8\u0304i\u03b1 i \u2202/ \u03b1\u03b2\nij \u2212 Mij + \u03bcij \u03b30 \u03c8\u03b2j ,\n\nwhere i, j = 1, 2, 3 are flavor indices and \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3 are color indices; Dirac indices have been suppressed; the mass\n\u03b1\u03b2\nmatrix is given by Mij\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 diag(0, 0, ms )ij and \u2202ij\n= \u2202\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4ij . The quark chemical potential matrix is as follows:\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\nij\n\n= (\u03bc\u03b4ij \u2212 \u03bce Qij )\u03b4\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n,\n+ \u03b4ij \u03bc3 T3 + \u221a \u03bc8 T8\n3\n\n(3)\n\nwith Qij = diag(2/3, \u22121/3, \u22121/3)ij the quark electric-charge matrix and T3 and T8 the Gell-Mann matrices in color\nspace. We are interested in the region close to the second order phase transition point between the normal phase and\nthe Color Superconductive phase, where, to the leading order approximation in \u03b4\u03bc/\u03bc, \u03bc3 = \u03bc8 = 0 and \u03bce = m2s /4\u03bc\nas in the unpaired phase [36]. In all the numerical estimates we use the value \u03bc = 500 MeV.\nIn order to describe quark interaction we employ a Nambu-Jona Lasinio (NJL) model in a mean field approximation.\nThe use of the NJL model can be motivated by renormalization group analyses [44] showing the dominance of the fourfermion interactions and in particular the numerical importance of the coupling mimicking one gluon exchange. We\nassume here that these results hold both at high and moderate hadronic densities. The resulting quark condensate\nis antisymmetric in color and flavor indices and we assume the behavior (1) for it. This phase has been studied\nemploying a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expansion in Ref. [27]. Requiring color and electric neutrality results in \u22061 = 0\nand, to the leading order in 1/\u03bc expansion, \u22062 = \u22063 . In [36] it has been shown that such corrections affect this result\nso that \u22062 < \u22063 . These effects will be discussed in Section V while in this Section we take into account only the\nleading order effect in \u03b4\u03bc/\u03bc.\nThe GL approximation is reliable in a region close to the second order phase transition point [28] where the favored\n\"crystal\" structure is characterized by q2 =q3 =q. The LOFF phase is energetically favored with respect to the gCFL\nphase and to the normal phase in the range of the chemical potential mismatch y \u2208 (130, 150) MeV, with\ny=\n\nm2s\n.\n\u03bc\n\n(4)\n\nMoreover the magnitude of q is given by\nq\u2243\n\ny\n,\n8 zq\n\nzq =\n\n1\n,\n1.1997\n\n(5)\n\nand \u2206 = \u22062 = \u22063 \u2264 0.3\u22060 where \u22060 is the value of the gap in the two-flavor homogeneous case [30]. We use the\nvalue \u22060 = 25 MeV. Recent analysis [30] have shown that the range of values of y where the LOFF state prevails\ncan be enlarged assuming a more complex pattern of space dependence for \u2206I (r). For the purposes of this paper it\nis however sufficient to consider the simple ansatz (1).\nIn the basis A = (1, ..., 9) = (ur , dg , sb , dr , ug , sr , ub , sg , db ) the quark chemical potentials can be expressed by\n\u03bcA = \u03bc + \u03bc\u0304A\n\n(6)\n\nwith\ny\n\u03bc\u03041 = \u2212 \u2212 2 q z ,\n6\n\n\u03bc\u03046 = \u2212\n\n\u03bc\u03042 =\n\ny\n,\n12\n\n5y\n\u2212qz,\n12\n\n\u03bc\u03043 = \u2212\n\n5y\n,\n12\n\ny\n\u03bc\u03047 = \u2212 + q z ,\n6\n\n\u03bc\u03044 = +\n\ny\n\u2212qz,\n12\n\n\u03bc\u03048 = \u2212\n\n5y\n,\n12\n\ny\n\u03bc\u03045 = \u2212 + q z ,\n6\n\n\u03bc\u03049 =\n\ny\n.\n12\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nHere\nz = cos \u03b8 ,\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\nwith \u03b8 the angle between the quark momentum and the pair momentum. For later convenience we also define\n\u03bcA (0) = \u03bcA (q = 0) .\n\n(10)\n\nWe note explicitly that the previous chemical potentials can be obtained by a redefinition of the quark fields in the\nfollowing way:\n\u03c8\u0303\u03b1i (x) = eiq\u03b1i *x \u03c8\u03b1i (x) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere q\u03b1i = q for (\u03b1, i) = [(r, d), (g, u), (r, s), (b, u)], q\u03b1i = 2q for (\u03b1, i) = (r, u) and q\u03b1i = 0 in the other cases. Such\na redefinition of the quark fields allows to eliminate the space dependence of the condensate. However quark momenta\nare shifted as follows:\npdg \u2192 pdg , psb \u2192 psb ,\npur \u2192 pur \u2212 2 q ,\npub \u2192 pub \u2212 q ,\npsr \u2192 psr \u2212 q ,\npdr \u2192 pdr \u2212 q , pug \u2192 pug \u2212 q ,\npd b \u2192 pd b .\npsg \u2192 psg ,\nIII.\n\n(12)\n\nNEUTRINO EMISSIVITY\n\nThe transition rate for the \u03b2 decay of a down quark d\u03b1 , of color \u03b1 = r, g, b, into an up quark u\u03b1\nd\u03b1 (p1 ) \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e (p2 ) + u\u03b1 (p3 ) + e\u2212 (p4 )\n\n(13)\n\nis\nWf i = V (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (p1 \u2212 p2 \u2212 p3 \u2212 p4 )|M|2\n\n4\nY\n\n1\n,\n2Ei V\ni=1\n\n(14)\n\nwhere V is the available volume and M is the invariant amplitude. Neglecting quark masses the squared invariant\namplitude averaged over the initial spins and summed over spins in the final state is\n|M|2 = 64G2F cos2 \u03b8c (p1 * p2 )(p3 * p4 ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant and \u03b8c the Cabibbo angle; we will neglect the strange-quark \u03b2 decay whose contribution\nis smaller by a factor of tan2 \u03b8c in comparison with (15). For relatively aging stars, there is no neutrino trapping [2]\nwhich means that neutrino momentum and energy are small. The magnitude of the other momenta is of the order of\nthe corresponding Fermi momenta p1F , p3F and p4F . As discussed in Section II, for d and u quarks they are of the order\nof 500 MeV; the electron momentum is of the order \u03bce , which is smaller, but, due to the assumptions discussed in the\nprevious section, still sizeable. On the other hand the neutrino momentum p2 is of the order kB T . It follows that the\nmomentum conservation can be implemented neglecting p2 and one can depict the 3-momentum conservation for the\ndecay (13) as a triangle [5] having for sides p1 , p3 and p4 . It follows that we can approximate\n(p1 * p2 )(p3 * p4 ) \u2243 E1 E2 E3 E4 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b812 )(1 \u2212 cos \u03b834 )\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Ej are the energies and \u03b812 (resp. \u03b834 ) is the angle between momenta of the down quark and the neutrino (resp.\nbetween the up quark and the electron). Neutrino emissivity \u03b5\u03bd is defined as the energy loss by neutrino emission\nper second per unit volume. To compute it, we have to multiply (15) by the neutrino energy and thermal factors,\nintegrate over the available phase space and sum over the three colors [5]. Moreover, since the states having definite\nenergy are the quasiquarks involved in the Cooper pairs, one has to multiply the result by two mixing (Bogoliubov)\ncoefficients depending on the quasiparticle dispersion laws [32]. Therefore we get\n\" 4 Z\n#\nX\nX 2 Y\nd3 pi\n\u03b1\n\u03b5\u03bd =\n\u03b5\u03bd =\nE2 Wf i\nV i=1 (2\u03c0)3\n\u03b1=r,g,b\n\n\u03b1=r,g,b\n\n*n(p1 ) * [1 \u2212 n(p3 )] * [1 \u2212 n(p4 )] * Bd2\u03b1 (p1 )Bu2\u03b1 (p3 )\n\n(17)\n\nwhere n(pj ) are thermal equilibrium Fermi distributions:\nn(pj ) =\n\n1\n,\n1 + exp xj\n\n(18)\n\n\f5\n\nxj =\n\nEj (pj ) \u2212 \u03bcj\n.\nT\n\n(19)\n\nThey are appropriate here because strong and electromagnetic processes establishing thermal equilibrium are much\nfaster than weak interactions. The overall factor of 2 keeps into account the electron capture process.\nThus far the results are similar to those of [32]. However, in the present case, the phase space integrations and the\nmomentum conservation law must be treated with great care. As a matter of fact, in the LOFF color superconductive\nstate d\u03b1 and u\u03b1 are in general paired with quarks of another color, and there is breaking of translational invariance\nbecause the total momentum of the Cooper pair is 2q. Let us choose the z\u2212axis along the direction of q and let \u03b8j\nand \u03c6j be the polar angles of pj . Since the temperature is much smaller than the gap parameter, the dominant modes\nin the d\u2212 and u\u2212momentum integrations are the gapless ones, that we denote as Pj (with j = 1 for down quark and\nj = 3 for up quark). They are defined as follows: P1 (resp. P3 ) is the quark down (resp. quark up) momentum where\nthe corresponding quasi-particle energy vanishes (for more details see the Appendix). On the other hand the relevant\nmomentum for the electron is its Fermi momentum. Therefore we have\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd3 p1 d3 p3 d3 p4 \u2248\n\u03bc2e dp4 d\u03a94 P12 dp1 d\u03a91 P32 dp3 d\u03a93 ,\n(20)\nwith d\u03a9j = sin \u03b8j d\u03b8j d\u03c6j . While these approximations are similar to the assumptions used in [32] in dealing with\nthe homogeneous gCFL phase, in the LOFF phase the gapless momenta P1 and P3 depend on the angle \u03b8j that\nquark momenta form with the pair momentum 2 q. In order to simplify the expression of the integral in Eq. (17) the\nvariables pj can be traded for xj , as in Eq. (19). We put x2 = E2 /T for the neutrino, x4 = (p \u2212 \u03bce )/T for the electron\nand Ej = \u03bcj + \u01ebj (p) for the quarks. Expanding around the gapless modes one has Ej (p) \u2243 \u03bcj + vj (p \u2212 Pj ) (for j = 1\nand 3), with the quasiparticle velocity given by\nvj =\n\n\u2202Ej\n\u2202p\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\np=Pj\n\nAs discussed in detail in the Appendix the dispersion law of each quasiparticles has from one to three gapless modes.\nTherefore one has to expand the corresponding dispersion laws around each gapless momentum. Another point to\nbe stressed concerns the conservation of three-momentum. As we have noted, to get rid of the space dependence\nin the condensate, one redefines the quark fields, see Eq. (11), which amounts to a redefinition of momenta as in\nEq. (12). Using the new quark fields in the weak decay matrix element (15) adds a momentum \u2212q to the momentum\nconservation law that now reads: p1 \u2212 p3 \u2212 p4 \u2212 q = 0 (where the neutrino momentum has been neglected).\nEmploying the above approximations the neutrino emissivity for each pair of gapless momenta P1 , P3 , can be written\nas\nZ\n4 Z\nP12 P32 Bd2\u03b1 (P1 )Bu2\u03b1 (P3 )\ndr Y\nG2F cos2 \u03b8c \u03bc2e T 6\nI\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b812 )(1 \u2212 cos \u03b834 ) e\u2212ir*(p1 \u2212p3 \u2212p4 \u2212q)\nd\u03a9j\n\u03b5\u03b1\n\u2243\n\u03bd\n8\n3\n32\u03c0\n(2\u03c0) j=1\n|v1 | |v3 |\nZ\nY Z\nP12 P32 Bd2\u03b1 (P1 )Bu2\u03b1 (P3 )\nG2 cos2 \u03b8c \u03bc2e T 6\ndr\n= F\nI\nd\u03a9\nj\n8\u03c0 7\n(2\u03c0)3 j=1,3,4\n|v1 | |v3 |\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2\n2\n2\nP + q \u2212 2qP1 cos \u03b81 \u2212 P3 \u2212 \u03bce\ne\u2212ir*(p1 \u2212p3 \u2212p4 \u2212q) ,\n(22)\n\u00d7 1\u2212 1\n2 \u03bce P3\nwhere P1 and P3 depend, respectively, on the angles \u03b81 and \u03b83 and Bi\u03b1 is a mixing coefficient arising from the\nBogoliubov-Valatin transformation representing the probability amplitude that the gapless quasiparticle has flavor i\nand color \u03b1.

Even if each quasiparticle dispersion law\nis characterized by various gapless momenta, the number of the gapless momenta relevant for the evaluation of the\nneutrino emissivity can be reduced observing that the momenta p1 , p3 and p4 , with |p4 | \u2243 \u03bce , must satisfy the\ncondition p1 \u2212 p3 \u2212 p4 \u2212 q = 0.\nWe now consider the contributions of the three colors separately. We discuss in detail only the decay of the blue\nquark that also gives the largest contribution. The decay of the other colors is treated analogously. The blue down\nquark is unpaired because in the Ginzburg-Landau approximation the gap parameter \u22061 vanishes [27]. Therefore,\nas discussed in the Appendix, the dispersion law is E1 (p) = p, with gapless momentum P1 = \u03bc9 , mixing coefficient\nBdb (P1 ) = 1 and v1 = 1.\nLet us now consider the up-blue quark. It is paired with the strange-red quark with gap parameter \u22062 = \u2206. In\nthe Appendix (subsection A 3) we give the dispersion law and the gapless momentum:\ns \u0012\n\u00132\ncos \u03b83\n\u03bc6 + \u03bc7\ny2\n1+\nP3 =\n+\n\u2212 \u22062 .\n(25)\n2\n64\nzq\nWe do not consider the momentum corresponding to the other gapless mode of Eq.

Because of this one expects\nthat the emissivity of these quarks is smaller than for blue quarks, an expectation confirmed by the numerical analysis.\nWe will report our numerical results in Section VI.\n\n\f7\nIV.\n\nSPECIFIC HEATS\n\nAt low temperatures the largest contribution to specific heat C is determined by the sum of the specific heats of\nthe fermionic quasi-particles. In the three flavor LOFF phase the quasi-particle specific heats are given by\nZ\n\u2202n(\u01ebj )\nd3p\n\u01ebj\n,\n(30)\ncj = 2\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u2202T\nwhere j = ur , dg , sb , dr , ug , sr , ub , sg , db and \u01ebj = |Ej (p) \u2212 \u03bcj | are the quasi-particle dispersion laws. Since we work\nin the regime T \u226a \u2206 \u226a \u03bc, the contributions of gapped modes are exponentially suppressed and each gapless mode\ncontributes by a factor \u221d T . This results follows from the evaluation of the integral in Eq.(30) employing the saddle\npoint method and assuming that the quasi-particle dispersion laws are linear in the gapless momenta. For the present\nchoice of parameters, the quasiparticle dispersion law is quadratic in the gapless momenta in a negligible range of\nvalues of the angle between the direction of quasiparticle momentum and the direction of q. Such a situation is\nquite different from the homogeneous gCFL case where a quasiparticle dispersion law is quadratic [32] and gives the\ndominant contribution to the specific heat.\nWithin the above-mentioned approximations the fermionic specific heath is given by\nZ\nu d\nu d\ni\n(P g r )2 (P g r )2 (P ub sr )2 (P ub sr )2\nT\nd cos \u03b8 h PI2\nP2\nP2\ns\nC\u2243\n+ II + III + +ug dr + \u2212ug dr + +ub sr + \u2212ub sr + (P\u2212db )2 + (P\u2212g )2 + \u03bc2e (31)\n3\n2\n|vI | |vII | |vIII |\n|v+ |\n|v\u2212 |\n|v+ |\n|v\u2212 |\nwhere the various gapless momenta and Fermi velocities on the r.h.s have been defined in the Appendix and in Eq.\n(21). In particular PI , PII and PIII are the gapless momenta of the sector (ur , dg , sb ) and vI , vII and vIII the\ncorresponding velocities. We have also added the electron contribution, though \u03bce is numerically much smaller than\nall the quark momenta Pg (generally of the order of \u03bc). We also note that the integration range is in general smaller\nthan (\u22121, +1) because the quasi-particle dispersion laws are gapless only in a restricted range of values of the variable\ncos \u03b8.\nV.\n\nROLE OF 1/\u03bc CORRECTIONS\n\nIn previous sections we have evaluated emissivity and specific heat in the three flavor LOFF phase of QCD. All\nthe calculations are based on the High Density Effective Theory, see [46, 47, 48], where one takes the limit \u03bc \u2192 \u221e.\nIn such approximation one neglects the contribution of the antiparticles; moreover the ms 6= 0 effects are treated at\n2\nthe leading order by a shift in the strange Fermi momentum pF\ns \u2248 \u03bcs \u2212 ms /2\u03bc. One can show [36] that, as already\nstressed in Section II, in this approximation the electron chemical potential \u03bce is given by \u03bce = m2s /4\u03bc, which implies\na symmetric splitting of the s and d Fermi surfaces around the u Fermi surface. Therefore \u22061 = 0 and \u22062 = \u22063 . If\n\u03bc is not large enough this approximation is not justified and higher order corrections must be included\nThe next-to-leading corrections were computed in [36]. One expands the strange quark momentum up to the\nnext-leading order:\n\u0012\n\u00132\nm2s\n1 m2s\npF\n\u2248\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\n(32)\ns\ns\n2\u03bcs\n2\u03bc 2\u03bc\nThen one substitutes this expression in the Lagrangian in Eq.(2), getting a correction. It can be proven [36] that\nother corrections, e.g. the antiparticle contribution, is next-to-next-to-leading in the weak coupling approximation\nand therefore can be safely neglected.\nKeeping only terms of O(\u2206/q)4 in the free energy, the 1/\u03bc shift in Eq. (32) results in the chemical potentials\n\u03bce =\n\nm2s\nm4s\n,\n\u2212\n4\u03bc\n48\u03bc3\n\n\u03bc3 , \u03bc8 = 0 .\n\n(33)\n\nThe introduction of the 1/\u03bc terms in the free energy results in an asymmetric splitting of the Fermi surfaces of the\nu, d and s quarks. As a matter of fact one gets in the normal phase\nm2\n5 m4s\n\u03bcu \u2212 p F\ns\n,\n= s +\n2\n8\u03bc\n96 \u03bc3\n\n\u03bcd \u2212 \u03bcu\nm2\n1 m4s\n.\n= s \u2212\n2\n8\u03bc\n96 \u03bc3\n\n(34)\n\nAs a consequence one expects in the LOFF phase still \u22061 = 0, but \u22062 < \u22063 . For example for \u03bc = 500 MeV one finds\nat m2s /\u03bc = 140 MeV that \u22062 = 0 and \u22063 \u2243 0.35\u22060 . Thus for this value of ms the vacuum consists of LOFF pairs\n\n\f8\nof ur \u2212 dg and ug \u2212 dr quarks and Fermi seas of unpaired s, ub and db quarks. This new phase was called LOFF2s\nin [36] since it is a two flavor LOFF phase whose excitation spectrum consists of quasi-particles with dispersion laws\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03bc4 \u2212 \u03bc5\n\u03bc4 + \u03bc5\n\u01eb=\n+ \u220623\n(35)\n\u00b1\np\u2212\n2\n2\nand a sea of unpaired blue and strange quarks.\nMotivated by these results we study neutrino emissivity and specific heat of the LOFF2s phase. Since blue up and\ndown quarks are unpaired, their contribution to the neutrino emissivity is 1/3 of the neutral unpaired quark matter.\nUsing for it the estimate of Ref. [5] one obtaines\n\u03b5blue\n\u2243\n\u03bd\n\n1 457 G2F cos2 \u03b8c\n\u03b1s \u03bcu \u03bcd \u03bce (kB T )6 ,\n\u00d7\n3 630 ~10 c6\n\n(36)\n\nwhere we have restored the correct factor of c, ~ and kB . We note that in this equation \u03b1s = g 2 /4\u03c0 = 4\u03b1c where g\ngives the coupling among quarks and gluons and \u03b1c is the coupling constant appearing in Ref. [5]. Notice that the use\nof this estimate by Iwamoto [5] is only indicative, because at the densities we are considering, perturbative QCD is\nunreliable. Therefore (36) can provide at best an order of magnitude estimate. Neglecting the contribution of strange\nquarks, the other contribution to the emissivity is determined by red and green light quarks and can be computed\nfollowing the same lines of Section III. Since the LOFF pairing results in a restriction of the available phase space,\nthe red and green channels contribute to the total decay rate less than the blue one, similarly to the discussion in\nSection III.\nNext we turn to the specific heat, which is given by\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\nZ\nT\n(P+ )2\nd cos \u03b8\n(P\u2212 )2\nC\u2243\n2\u00d7\n(37)\n+ (\u03bcsb )2 + (\u03bcsr )2 + (\u03bcub )2 + (\u03bcdb )2 + (\u03bcsg )2 + \u03bc2e\n+\n3\n2\nv+\nv\u2212\nwhere the gapless momenta P\u00b1 are defined as\nP\u00b1 =\n\nr\n\n\u03bc4 \u2212 \u03bc5\n\u2212 \u220623\n2\n\n(38)\n\n\u00132\n\u03bc4 \u2212 \u03bc5\n\u2212 \u220623\n2\n.\n\u03bc4 \u2212 \u03bc5\n2\n\n(39)\n\n\u03bc4 + \u03bc5\n\u00b1\n2\n\nand the Fermi velocities are given by\n\nv+ = v\u2212 =\n\ns\u0012\n\nThe factor 2 in the first two addenda of the r.h.s. of Eq. (37) takes into account the fact that the dispersion laws for\nthe ur \u2212 dg quasiparticles are the same of the ug \u2212 dr ones.\nVI.\n\nCOOLING BY NEUTRINO EMISSION\n\nLet us assume the presence of quark matter in the LOFF state in the core of a compact star. This will affect the\ncooling process and we now discuss these effects by comparing various models of stars along lines similar to Ref. [32].\nGiven the approximations used in the study of the LOFF phase, in particular the use of the simple ansatz (1) instead\nof more complex space behavior of the condensate, it would be fruitless to employ sophisticated models. Therefore we\nwill use a simplified approach based on the study of four different star toy models. The first model (denoted as I) is\na star consisting of noninteracting \"nuclear\" matter (neutrons, protons and electrons) with mass M = 1.4M\u2299 , radius\nR = 12 km and uniform density n = 1.5 n0 , where n0 = 0.16 fm\u22123 is the nuclear equilibrium density. The nuclear\nmatter is assumed to be electrically neutral and in beta equilibrium. The second model (II) is a star containing a\ncore of radius R1 = 5 km of neutral unpaired quark matter in weak equilibrium at \u03bc = 500 MeV, with a mantle\nof noninteracting nuclear matter with uniform density n. Assuming a star mass M = 1.4 M\u2299 from the solution of\nthe Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations one gets a star radius R2 = 10 km. Finally we discuss two simplified\nmodels of compact stars containing a core of electric and color neutral three flavors quark matter in the LOFF phase,\nwith \u03bc = 500 MeV and m2s /\u03bc = 140 MeV and \u22060 = 25 MeV. Both models have a mantle of noninteracting nuclear\n\n\f9\nmatter and differ by the values of the LOFF gaps. In model III we neglect O(1/\u03bc) corrections and we take \u22061 = 0\nand \u22062 = \u22063 = 0.25 \u22060 , the value of the gap parameters in the LOFF phase at y = 140 MeV [27]. This is the\napproximation discussed in Section II. In model IV we include the 1/\u03bc correction discussed in Section V and we take\nthe values of the gaps as in the LOFF2s model discussed in Ref. [36], i.e. \u22061 = \u22062 = 0, \u22063 = 0.28 \u22060 for m2s /\u03bc = 140\nMeV. Since the values of the gaps in both LOFF models are small the radii of the star and of the quark core do not\ndiffer appreciably from those of a star with a core of unpaired quark matter, i.e. R1 = 5 and R2 = 10 km (also in\nthese cases M = 1.4M\u2299 ).\nThe main mechanisms of cooling are by neutrino emission and by photon emission, the latter dominating at later\nages. Therefore the star cooling is governed by the following differential equation:\ndT\nL\u03bd + L\u03b3\nVnm \u03b5nm\n+ Vqm \u03b5qm\n\u03bd\n\u03bd + L\u03b3\n=\u2212\n.\nqm = \u2212\nnm\nnm\ndt\nVnm cV + Vqm cV\nVnm cV + Vqm cqm\nV\n\n(40)\n\nHere T is the inner temperature at time t, while L\u03bd and L\u03b3 are neutrino and photon luminosities, i.e. heat losses\nper unit time. Neutrino luminosity is obtained multiplying the emissivity by the corresponding volume. Therefore\none must distinguish between the emissivity \u03b5nm\nof nuclear matter, which is present in the volume Vnm , from the\n\u03bd\nemissivity due to quarks, if they are present in some volume Vqm ; cnm\nand cqm\nV\nV denote specific heats of the two forms\nof hadronic matter.\nFor the emissivity of nuclear matter \u03b5nm\nwe use the standard value [1]:\n\u03bd\n\u03b5nm\n= 1.2 \u00d7 104 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121\n\u03bd\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0012\n\nn\nn0\n\n\u00132/3 \u0012\n\nT\n107 K\n\n\u00138\n\n(41)\n\narising from the analysis of the modified Urca processes n + X \u2192 p + X + e + \u03bd\u0304, with X = p or n. As for the quark\ncontribution \u03b5qm\n\u03bd , we consider both unpaired quarks and quarks in the LOFF state, depending on the model. The\nformer contribution is denoted \u03b5qm,unpaired\nand is given by Eq.(36) multiplied by a factor of 3. The latter have been\n\u03bd\nestimated in Sections III and V for the two models of LOFF quark matter. For all these stars we assume a common\ninterior temperature T , since the matter comprising compact stars is made of good conductors (p, n or quarks).\nLet us now turn to cooling by photon emission, the dominant process for sufficiently old stars (t > 106 years). In\nthis case the luminosity can be estimated in the black-body approximation as follows:\nL\u03b3 = 4\u03c0R2 \u03c3Ts4 ,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the star, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and\n6\n\n4\n\nTs = (0.87 \u00d7 10 K)\n\n\u0012\n\ngs\n14\n10 cm/s2\n\n\u00131/4 \u0012\n\nT\n108 K\n\n\u00130.55\n\n,\n\n(43)\n\nis the surface temperature [49, 50], with gs = GN M/R2 the surface gravity.\nLet us now discuss specific heats. They are given for the LOFF model III and for the LOFF2s model IV by Eqs. (31)\nand (37) respectively. For nuclear and unpaired quark matter the total specific heat is given by the sum of the specific\nheats of the different fermionic species. They can be approximated by the fermionic ideal gas result\ncV =\n\n2\nkB\nT p 2 2\npF m c + (pF )2 ,\n3\n3~ c\n\n(44)\n\nwhere m is the fermionic mass and pF the Fermi momentum. For non-interacting nuclear matter, the three species\nare neutrons, protons and electrons with Fermi momenta evaluated as in neutral matter in weak equilibrium [1]:\npnF\nppF\n\n\u00131/3\nn\n= (340 MeV)\n,\nn0\n\u0012 \u00132/3\nn\ne\n= pf = (60 MeV)\n.\nn0\n\u0012\n\n(45)\n\nFor neutral unpaired quark matter in weak equilibrium, there are nine quark species, with Fermi momenta independent\nm2\n5m2s\nm2\n.\nof color and given by pdF = \u03bc + s , puF = \u03bc \u2212 s , psF = \u03bc \u2212\n12\u03bc\n6\u03bc\n12\u03bc\nEq. (40) is solved imposing a given temperature T0 at a fixed early time t0 (we use T0 \u2192 \u221e for t0 \u2192 0). In Figs.\n1, 2 and 3 the cooling curves for various models of stars are shown.

Solid\nblack curve refers to model I; dashed line (red online) refers to model II; dotted curve (blue online) refers to model III. Model I\nis a a neutron star formed by nuclear matter with uniform density n = 0.24 fm\u22123 and radius R = 12 Km; model II corresponds\nto a star with R2 = 10 km, having a mantle of nuclear matter and a core of radius R1 = 5 Km of unpaired quark matter,\ninteracting via gluon exchange; model III is like model II, but in the core there is quark matter in the LOFF state, see text for\nmore details. All stars have M = 1.4 M\u2299 . Parameters for the core are \u03bc = 500 MeV and m2s /\u03bc=140 MeV.\n\na function of time, in years, for three models is reported. Solid line (black online) is for model I (electrically neutral\nnuclear matter made of non interacting neutrons, protons and electrons in beta equilibrium); dashed curve (red online)\nrefers to model II (nuclear matter mantle and a core of unpaired quark matter, interacting via gluon exchange); the\ndotted line (blue online) is for model III (nuclear matter mantle and a core of quark matter in the LOFF state in the\nleading 1/\u03bc\n\u221a approximation, as discussed in Section II). The curve reported in Figs. 1 and 2 for model III corresponds\nto ms = 140 \u03bc MeV, however with increasing values of ms the neutrino emissivity decreases. This is due to the fact\nthat \u2206 decreases as one approaches the second order phase transition to the normal state. On the other hand in this\ncase the quark matter in the star tends to become a normal Fermi liquid, for which the description of Iwamoto which\nincludes Fermi liquid effects, must be adopted.\nFig. 2 gives the star surface temperature as a function of time, as obtained by use of Eq. (43). The three curves\nrefer to the same toy stars as in Fig. 1. Both diagrams are obtained for the following values of the parameters:\n\u03bc = 500 MeV, m2s /\u03bc = 140 MeV, \u22061 = 0, \u22062 = \u22063 \u2243 6 MeV. For unpaired quark matter we use \u03b1s \u2243 1, the value\ncorresponding to \u03bc = 500 MeV and \u039bQCD = 250 MeV. The use of perturbative QCD at such small momentum scales\nis however questionable. Therefore the results for model II should be considered with some caution and the curve is\nplotted only to allow a comparison with the other models. In particular the similarity between the LOFF curve and\nthe unpaired quark curve follows from the fact that the LOFF phases are gapless, so that the scaling laws cV \u223c T and\n\u03b5\u03bd \u223c T 6 are analogous to those of the unpaired quark matter. However the cooling curve for unpaired quark matter\ndepends on the value we assumed for the strong coupling constant, \u03b1s \u2243 1, which is an extrapolation to a regime\nwhere perturbative QCD is less reliable. Therefore the similarity between the curves of models II and III might be\naccidental.\nIn Fig. 3 we compare two models of a star with a nuclear mantle and a quark core in the LOFF state. The\nappoximation used for these LOFF states were discussed in Sections II and V. The continuous curve (red online) is\nfor model III and the dashed black curve is for model IV, i.e. with quarks in the LOFF2s state. One can note that\nboth curves for the LOFF models are similar and show a rapid cooling, much faster than for ordinary stars comprising\nonly nuclear matter. This implies that the results for models with a LOFF core are rather robust and, at least for\nrelatively young stars, the presence of quark matter in the LOFF state should offer a signature clearly distinct from\nthat of an ordinary neutron star.\n\n\f11\n6.5\n\nLog Ts [K]\n\n6\n5.5\n5\n\nNuclear\nLOFF\nQuark\n\n4.5\n4\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nLog t [yrs]\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Surface temperature Ts , in Kelvin, as a function of time, in years, for the three toy models of pulsars\ndescribed in Fig. 1.\n\nLog T [K]\n\n7\n\n6\n\nLOFF\nLOFF2s\n\n5\n4\n\n6\n\n5\n\n7\n\nLog t [yrs]\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Comparison of the cooling curves for the two toy models of stars with a core of quarks in a LOFF state.\nThe curves express the inner temperature, in Kelvin, as a function of time, in years, for model III (solid, red online, curve) and\nmodel IV (dashed black curve). Model III is a star with a radius R2 = 10 km, having a mantle of nuclear matter and a core\nof radius R1 = 5 Km of quark matter in the LOFF state in the leading approximation (\u22061 = 0, \u22062 = \u22063 \u2243 6 MeV); model\nIV is analogous to model III, but the core is in the LOFF2s phase (\u22061 = \u22062 = 0 , \u22063 \u2243 7 MeV). All stars have M = 1.4 M\u2299 .\nParameters for the core are \u03bc = 500 MeV and m2s /\u03bc=140 MeV.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur study can be summarized as follows. We have computed neutrino emissivity and specific heat for quark matter\nin the LOFF state of QCD in presence of three light quarks. Quark matter has been assumed to be in weak equilibrium\nand in a color and electrically neutral state. We have considered the simplest ansatz for the condensates (single plane\nwave for all LOFF pairings). We have studied two models of the LOFF state, differing in the approximations used\nfor the Ginzburg Landau evaluation of the free energy and the gap equation. Our analysis shows a similarity between\nthe two approximations, which points to a robustness of our results. We have used this study for an estimate of the\ncooling of compact stars with a nuclear mantle and a quark core.\nWhich conclusions can we draw from the present study? From Figs. 1 and 2 we see that stars with a LOFF core cool\ndown faster than ordinary neutron stars. This might have interesting phenomenological consequences. At the present\ntime observational results on the cooling of pulsars are being accumulated at an increasing rate (for compilation of\ndata and comparison between theoretical models and data see, e.g. [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]). Some data indicate\nthat stars with an age in the range 103 \u2212 104 years have a temperature significantly smaller than what is expected\non the basis of the modified Urca processes. It is difficult however to infer, from these data, predictions on the star\n\n\f12\ncomposition, as the stars may have different masses. As for the impact on our study, it is useful to repeat here that\nour analysis should be considered as preliminary because the identification of the quasiparticle dispersion laws for\nthe favored crystalline LOFF structures, formed by more plane waves, is still lacking. This is the reason why we\nhave not tried a comparison with observations in this paper. Nevertheless some qualitative assessments can be made.\nQuantum Chromodynamics predicts that at the densities that can be reached in the core of compact stars deconfined\nquark matter should be present, and, if so, it should be in a color superconductive state, since Cooper condensation\nof colored diquarks is energetically favored. Slow cooling is typical of stars containing only nuclear matter or of stars\nwith a color superconductive quark core in a gapped phase (e.g. CFL). If a careful comparison with the data could\nallow to rule out slow cooling for star masses in the range we have considered, this would favor either the presence\nof condensed mesons or quark matter in a gapless state in the core, since gapped quarks emit neutrinos very slowly.\nMeson condensation also might allow rapid cooling. However reliable calculations based on the chiral effective field\ntheory [51] can only be made for m2s \u2243 \u03bc\u2206, i.e. far away from the region where the LOFF state is stable; therefore no\ndirect comparison between the two phases is available. For intermediate densities the quark normal state is less favored\nthan color superconductive states for a wide range of values of the baryonic chemical potential \u03bc and the strange\nquark mass ms . This leaves us with gapless quark phases and, among them the LOFF state is favored since we know\nthat the gapless phases with homogeneous gap parameters such as, e.g. the gCFL or the g2SC phase are instable,\nwhile the LOFF phase does not suffer of a similar instability. Let us finally observe that our conclusions should remain\nvalid, at least qualitatively, also for more complex crystalline patterns of the LOFF condensate. Apparently the fast\ncooling of relatively young stars with a LOFF quark core is a consequence of the scaling laws for neutrino emissivity\nand specific heat. They depend on the existence of gapless points and follow from the existence of blocking regions in\nmomentum space. Since this property is typical of the LOFF state, independently of detailed form of the condensate,\na rapid cooling should be appropriate not only for the simple ansatz assumed in Eq. (1), but, more generally, for any\nLOFF condensate.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank M. Alford, M. Ciminale, R. Gatto, C. Kouvaris, A. Mirizzi, A. Schmitt, I. Shovkovy and\nQ.

The case of the LOFF2s model (\u22061 = \u22062 = 0, \u22063 6= 0), can be treated in a similar\nway. Since the matrix (A1) is block-diagonal, we consider its various sectors separately.\n1.\n\nSector A = (ur , dg , sb )\n\nTo get the dispersion laws of the quasiparticles one has to find the poles of the propagator.
