Extending the\nwork of Riemann, Gram introduced a procedure for detecting these zeroes: Gram's Law. It is known that Gram's Law fails infinitely often, and\nthat a weaker formulation of Gram's Law is true infinitely often. This\npaper extends these results by showing that there is a positive proportion\nof both failures and (weak) successes.\n\n1\n\nGram's Law\n\nConnected to \u03b6(s) are two functions known as the Riemann-Siegel functions,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nZ(t) = ei\u03b8(t) \u03b6\n+ it ,\n(1)\n2\nwhere\n\nt\nt\nlog\n+ O(t),\n(2)\n2\n2\u03c0\nis a steadily increasing function of t and Z(t) is real-valued whenever t itself is\nreal-valued. Hence the zeroes of \u03b6( 12 + it) coincide precisely with those of Z(t).\nTherefore the search for zeroes of the zeta-function is equivalent to a search for\nchanges in sign of Z(t). From (1) it follows that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b6\n+ it = Z(t) cos{\u03b8(t)} \u2212 iZ(t) sin{\u03b8(t)},\n(3)\n2\n\u03b8(t) \u223c\n\n\u2217 The\n\nauthor is gracious of the support of a General Sir John Monash Award.\n\n1\n\n\fand so at the Gram points \u03b8(gn ) = n\u03c0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b6\n+ ign = (\u22121)n Z(gn ).\n2\n\n(4)\n\nGram [4] found that R{\u03b6( 21 + it)} > 0 frequently1 so that, in particular Z(gn )\nand Z(gn+1 ) were often of opposite sign, whence a zero of \u03b6( 12 + it) must occur\nin this interval. Gram noted that this pattern can reasonably be expected to\ncontinue: one zero of \u03b6( 12 + it) between successive Gram points. Gram located\nthe first 15 non-trivial zeroes of \u03b6(s) using this method and found each one to\nlie on the line. Hutchinson extended these results in [5] to show that the first\n138 zeroes are on the line and later Titchmarsh [9] improved this to the first\n1041 zeroes. In all cases it was shown that there were no other complex zeroes\nup to these heights. For a comprehensive historical account of the applications\nof Gram's Law to finding zeroes of the zeta-function, see [1, pp.171-182].\nGram's Law, as defined by Hutchinson (ibid ) is that statement that there\nis exactly one zero of \u03b6( 12 + it) for t \u2208 (gn , gn+1 ] and that this is the only2 zero of\nwith R(t) \u2208 (gn , gn+1 ]. A weakened version of Gram's Law (hereafter referred\nto as the Weak Gram Law) is the statement that there is at least one zero of\n\u03b6( 12 + it) for t \u2208 (gn , gn+1 ]. The successes of Gram's Law were first investigated\nby analysing the discrete properties of the function Z(t), but later the argument\nfunction S(t) was used to obtain improvements.\n\nThe function S(t) and Gram's Law\n\n1.1\n\nAs is standard let S(T ) = \u03c0 \u22121 arg{\u03b6( 12 + iT )} (for more properties on the\nfunction S(T ) see, for example [10, pp. 212-223]) and so by the Riemann-von\nMangoldt formula\nS(T ) = N (T ) \u2212 \u03c0 \u22121 \u03b8(T ) \u2212 1,\n(5)\nwhere N (T ) is the number of zeroes of \u03b6(\u03c3 + it) for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T . Since \u03b8(gn ) = n\u03c0\nand \u03b8(t) is a steadily increasing function of t, it is seen at once that S(T ) is\nintegral precisely at the Gram points. Furthermore if S(gn ) = \u03bb and there is\nexactly one zero in the Gram interval (gn , gn+1 ] then S(gn+1 ) = \u03bb and |S(t) \u2212\n\u03bb| \u2264 1 throughout the interval. So intervals in which Gram's Law is valid induce\nsome constancy in the function S(t) and it is this constancy which forms the\nbasis of the following analysis.\n\n2\n\nGeneral Failures\n\nTitchmarsh showed in [8] that Gram's Law fails infinitely often. This section\nwill show that Gram's Law and the Weak Gram Law fail a positive proportion\nof the time (given in Theorem 1 on p.5 and Theorem 2 on p.6 respectively).\n1 The\n\nRiemann-Siegel formula gives some basis for this empirical observation:\nP\n\u22121/2 cos(\u03bd log g )+ O(g \u22121/4 ), where X = (g /2\u03c0)1/2 . The first term\n(\u22121)n Z(gn ) = 2 X\nn\nn\nn\n\u03bd=1 \u03bd\nin the summation is +1 and thereafter the terms are oscillatory and decreasing in magnitude.\n2 Thus Gram's Law if it were true implies the Riemann hypothesis.\n\n2\n\n\fThe following result due to Fujii [2] concerns the 'shifted moments' of S(t),\nviz.\nZ 2T\nI(T ) =\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2 dt\nT\nh\ni\n1\n= \u03c0 \u22122 T log (3 + h log T ) + O T {log (3 + h log T )} 2 ,\n(6)\nwhich is valid for 0 \u2264 h \u2264 21 T . This becomes an asymptotic relationship, i.e.\nI(T ) \u223c \u03c0 \u22122 T log (3 + h log T ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nif h log T is sufficiently large. Henceforth h = C0 (log T )\u22121 , where C0 is a constant that is chosen to be sufficiently large to ensure the dominance of the main\nterm in (6) over the error term.\nIf t and t + h are in a connected union of Gram intervals in which Gram's\nLaw is valid, then |S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)| \u2264 2. Thence I(T ) \u2264 4T which is 'too small',\nin that this is not asymptotic to \u03c0 \u22122 T log (3 + h log T ). This lends credence to\nwhat has already been shown using the work of Ghosh [3]: that for sufficiently\nlarge T there must be at least one failure3 of Gram's Law between heights T\nand 2T . In some loose sense, if S is the set on which Gram's Law is valid and\nS is the complement of S in [T, 2T ], then (6) can be rewritten\nI(T ) \u223c \u03c0 \u22122 T log (3 + h log T )\nZ\nZ\n2\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2 dt\n=\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)| dt +\nS\nS\nZ\n\u2264 4|S| +\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2 dt,\n\n(8)\n\nS\n\nwhence an estimate on |S| can be made.\nTo this end, let the sequences {in } and {jn } index the Gram points such\nthat Gram's Law holds on the collection of intervals\n(gin , gjn ] and Gram's Law\n\u0003\nfails on the collection of intervals gjn , gin+1 . Also let kn = in+1 \u2212 jn , that is,\nthe number\nof consecutive Gram points between which Gram's Law fails. So\nP\nthen n kn = NF (2T ): the number of failures between heights T and 2T . It\nis now appropriate to introduce the following elementary result concerning Ng :\nthe number of Gram points between heights T and 2T ,\nLemma 1 Ng \u223c (2\u03c0)\u22121 T log T . Furthermore if gn and gm are Gram points in\nthe interval [T, 2T ] then gn \u2212 gm = O( n\u2212m\nlog T ).\nThe first statement follows from both (2) and the definition of the Gram points.\nSince it can be shown (see [10, p 263]) that \u03b8\u2032 (t) \u223c 21 log t, then the mean value\ntheorem gives\n\u03b8(gn ) \u2212 \u03b8(gm )\n(n \u2212 m)\u03c0\n1\n=\n= log \u03be,\n(9)\ngn \u2212 gm\ngn \u2212 gm\n2\n3 This\n\nhas been shown by the author and is being prepared for publication.\n\n3\n\n\ffor some \u03be \u2208 (gn , gm ), whence the result follows.\nIt is clear that the relative locations of t and t + h will determine the bound\non |S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|: namely if gin \u2264 t \u2264 t + h \u2264 gjn then |S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)| \u2264 2.\nThis leads to the definition\nS := {t \u2208 [T, 2T ]\n\n: gin \u2264 t \u2264 t + h \u2264 gjn },\n\n: \u2203n\n\n(10)\n\nwhence S |S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2 dt \u2264 4T , as claimed.\nNow let S be the complement of S in [T, 2T ]. Then,\nif t belongs to S either\n\u0003\nt \u2208 (gin , gjn ] and t + h \u2265 gjn ; or t \u2208 gjn , gin+1 . The former condition is\nequivalent to gjn \u2265 t \u2265 gjn \u2212 h and so in any case gjn \u2212 h \u2264 t \u2264 gin+1 . These\nintervals may overlap in [T, 2T ] and indeed\n[\n\u0003\ngjn \u2212 h, gin+1 .\n(11)\nS\u2282\nR\n\nn\n\nWhether or not these intervals are disjoint is of no consequence for Lemma 1\ngives\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\n1\nkn\nNF (2T ).\n(12)\n\u226a h+\n|S| \u226a\nh+\nlog T\nlog T\nn\nUltimately an estimate on this number NF (2T ) is sought and hence the\nimposition of a lower bound of (12) would be useful. Returning to (8) it is seen\nthat\nZ\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2 dt\n\u03c0 \u22122 T log (3 + h log T ) \u2264 4|S| +\nS\nZ\n\u2264 4T +\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2 dt.\n(13)\nS\n\n\u22121\n\nCurrently h = C0 (log T ) and C0 is chosen to be sufficiently large such that\nthe main term in (6) dominates the error term.

AT log T \u2264\nNF0 \u2264 AT log T . There is little else4 to be said about the nature of F0 intervals,\nso it is natural to now turn to the remaining cases: those Gram intervals which\ncontain at least one zero of \u03b6( 12 + it).\n\n3\n\nFk intervals\n\nTitchmarsh showed in [7] that the Weak Gram Law is true5 infinitely often.\nWhat is actually shown in his proof is that there is an infinite number of Gram\nintervals which contain an odd number of zeroes. His proof concludes that the\nproportion of Gram intervals between T and 2T which contain an odd number of\nzeroes of \u03b6( 12 + it) is greater than A(T 1/3 log2 T )\u22121 , with A a positive constant.\nThis section will show (in Theorem 3 on p.9) that the Weak Gram Law is true\na positive proportion of the time.\n4 One possibility is to calculate these constants, but this is not achievable via the methods\nin this paper.\n5 One remark to be made is that it is not yet known whether Gram's Law is true infinitely\noften.\n\n6\n\n\f3.1\n\nOutline\n\nIt is difficult to investigate the quantities NFk for 'small' k, since the induced\nbehaviour in S(t) is virtually undetectable. Indeed the methods used in \u00a71 viz.\nshifted moments of S(t) are unable to distinguish a collection of F1 intervals from\na sequence of alternating F0 and F2 intervals. Investigations into the frequency\nof successes of Gram's Law (or the quantity NF1 ) must be made through some\nother route. What can be said is a measure of the success of Gram's Law in its\nweak sense: that is the number of intervals which contain at least one zero of\n\u03b6( 12 + it).\nBy Selberg's result, a positive proportion of zeroes lie on the critical line;\nclearly each zero is contained within a Gram interval. There is a possibility that\nwhen k is arbitrarily large there are many Fk intervals which contain the bulk\nof these zeroes. To rule out this possibility it is necessary to place a bound on\nthe growth of NFk as k \u2192 \u221e. Once this has been established it will be shown\nthat there is a K such that the Gram intervals containing fewer than K zeroes\ntogether contain the positive proportion of zeroes.\n\n3.2\n\nImprovements in the function S(t)\n\nMuch work has been done concerning the number of zeroes of \u03b6( 12 + it) of multiplicity greater than one. Extending this work to short intervals, particularly\nGram intervals is natural since a zero of order m will induce similar behaviour\nin S(t) as will m simple zeroes. The following result is due to Korolev [6]\nIm =\n\nZ\n\nT +H\n\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2m dt \u2264 Cm2\n\nT\n\nwhere\n27\n\nH = T 82 + \u01eb;\n\n0 < \u01eb < 0.001;\n\nh=\n\n\u0001m\n\nH,\n\n(29)\n\n2\u03c0\n,\nT\n3 log 2\u03c0\n\n(30)\n\nand C is given as an explicit positive constant. This formula has h = c (log T )\u22121 ,\nwhere c is small relative to the length of Gram intervals. In order to easily\ndetect the contribution of an Fk interval to the integrand in (29), the h must\nbe replaced with N h (with N to be chosen later) such that N h is longer than\na Gram interval. The following, which is easily deduced from Lemma 1, will\nprove useful\nLemma 2 Denote the length of the longest Gram interval in [T, T + H] by L+\nand the length of the shortest by L\u2212 . Then\nL+ =\nand\nL\u2212 =\n\n2\u03c0\n,\nT\nlog 2\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n=\n+H\nT\n+ log(1 +\nlog T 2\u03c0\nlog 2\u03c0\n7\n\nH\nT )\n\n(31)\n\n=\n\n2\u03c0\n{1 + o(T )} .\nT\nlog 2\u03c0\n\n(32)\n\n\fNow suppose the interval (gn , gn+1 ] is an Fk interval and that S(gn ) = \u03bb.\nThen S(gn+1 ) = \u03bb + k \u2212 1 and thenceforth S(t) can decrease by at most one\non the interval (gn+1 , gn+2 ]. Furthermore for t \u2208 (gn\u22122 , gn\u22121 ] it follows that\nS(t) < \u03bb + 2. The choice of N must be made such that t + N h \u2265 gn+1 , which\nis satisfied if\nN h \u2265 (gn+1 \u2212 gn\u22122 ) \u2265 3L+ = 9h,\n(33)\nso that N = 9 will suffice. When T is sufficiently large, Lemma 2 shows\nt+N h < gn+2 and so over an interval of length L\u2212 the difference |S(t+h)\u2212S(t)|\nis now bounded below by |k \u2212 4|. By an application of the H\u00f6lder inequality\n(29) then becomes\nZ\n\nT +H\n\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2m dt \u2264 92m\u22121\n\nT\n\n8 Z\nX\ni=0\n\nT +ih+H\n\n|S(t + h) \u2212 S(t)|2m dt. (34)\n\nT +ih\n\nApplying (29) with T + ih in place of T it is seen that,\nZ\n\nT +H\n\n|S(t + N h) \u2212 S(t)|2m dt \u2264 (Am2 )m H{1 + o(1)},\n\n(35)\n\nT\n\nwhere A is a positive constant. Now suppose there are NFk intervals between\nheights T and T + H. Each one will contribute at least |k \u2212 4|2m in the above\nintegrand over a length at least L\u2212 . Thus\n(Am2 )m H{1 + o(1)} \u2265\n\n\u03c0NFk (T ) (k \u2212 4)2m\n,\nT\nlog 2\u03c0\n\n(36)\n\nor, expressed more succinctly,\nNFk (T )\n\u226a\nH log T\n\n\u0012\n\nAm2\n(k \u2212 4)2\n\n\u0013m\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\nNow the task is to find the value of m depending on k that minimises the right\nhand inequality. Let\n\u0012\n\u0013m\nAm2\nF (m) =\n,\n(38)\n(k \u2212 4)2\nthen\n\ndF (m)\n=\ndm\n\n\u0012\n\nAm2\n(k \u2212 4)2\n\n\u0013m \u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\nAm2\n2 + log\n,\n(k \u2212 4)2\n\n(39)\n\n\u221a\nand clearly this stationary point m\u2217 = (k\u22124)\nis indeed a minimum. Since m is\ne A\nan integer the value to be taken is whichever of [m\u2217 ] or [m\u2217 ] + 1 is the nearer to\nm. The error of such an assignment of value is O(1) in the exponent and can\nbe absorbed into the ultimate O-constant. Thus, given a value of k the value\nm = m\u2217 gives the bound\n\nNFk (T )\n\u226a exp(\u2212Ak),\nH log T\n8\n\n(40)\n\n\fwhere A is a positive constant, and clearly this result remains valid if H is\nreplaced with T . So Fk intervals, for large k are 'exponentially rare'.\nSince a positive proportion of zeroes lie on the critical line, the inequality in\n(40) can be used to show that a positive proportion of Gram intervals contain\nat least one zero. For, there is a constant A\u2032 such that\n0 < A\u2032 <\n\nNF1 (T ) + 2NF2 (T ) + . . . + kNFk (T ) + . . .\n,\nT log T\n\n(41)\n\nand by (40) this series on the right hand side is convergent. So,\nP if \u03b4 is any small\npositive number, choose K so large that the sum (T log T )\u22121 \u221e\nk=K+1 kNFk (T )\nis not greater than A\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4. Then\nPK\nPK\nNFk (T )\nk=1 kNFk (T )\n0<\u03b4<\n< K k=1\n,\n(42)\nT log T\nT log T\nwhence the number of Gram intervals which contain at least one zero is at least\nAT log T , with A a positive constant. Thus the following has been proved\nTheorem 3 For sufficiently large T there is a positive proportion of successes\nof the Weak Gram Law between T and 2T .\n\n4\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nFrom (42) it follows that there must be a positive proportion of at least one of\nthe NFk 's. Intuitively one might expect NFk to be steadily decreasing with k\n(which would be an improvement to the estimate in (40)). If such a relation\ncould be shown it would therefore follow that there is a positive proportion of\nintervals in which Gram's Law is valid.\n\nReferences\n[1] H. M. Edwards. Riemann's Zeta Function.
