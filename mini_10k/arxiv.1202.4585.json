Introduction\nLight\u2013matter interaction is one of the most addressed\nsubjects in scientific research. In nature, the light\u2013matter\ninteraction occurs on the scale of single atom states [1]\n[2] [3] . Single atom response can be controlled by\nexternal fields and by varying the wavelength of\npropagating light. On the other hand, the response of a\nmedium to light is a collective effect and can be\ncontrolled by the structure of the media, i.e. by the\nrelative positions of different atoms within the material.\nConsequently, the propagation of light can be\nsubstantially modified in structured artificial materials:\nin metamaterials, where the magnetic and electric\nresponses are modified on a nanometer scale [4] [5] ,\nand also in Photonic Crystals (PhC), where the\nrefractive index is modulated on the wavelength scale\n[6] [7] [8] .\nDuring the last decade new beam propagation effects\nhave been discovered and investigated in the field of\nPhCs. Precisely due to the periodic modulation of\nrefractive index, the spatial dispersion curves\n\uf02disofrequency lines of the Bloch modes, \uf077(k), or\nequivalently the curve families k (k\uf05e ) \uf02dare modified in\ncomparison to those in homogeneous media, leading to\ndifferent\nbeam-propagation\npeculiarities:\nselfcollimation [9] [13] , focalization and imaging behind\nthe PhC structure [14] [1] [16] , spatial (angular)\nfiltering [17] [18] , among others. We note that those\nspatial propagation effects are not restricted to\n\nelectromagnetic waves but are also observed or\npredicted in other fields of wave mechanics, acoustics\n[19] [20] , and atom Bose condensates [24] .\nAs it is evident from the well-known Kramers\u2013Kronig\nrelations, a modulation of the refractive index is\ngenerally accompanied by a modulation of absorption or\nemission. Moreover, at resonant frequencies, the effects\nof absorption/emission can become relevant and have to\nbe taken into account in addition to beam propagation\neffects arising from refractive index modulation. As a\nresult, the new problem to be considered is light\npropagation within materials with a spatially modulated\ngain/loss. In the general case, one should consider\nsimultaneously both gain/loss and index modulation.\nThe present paper provides a detailed analysis of light\npropagation in Gain/Loss Modulated Materials\n(GLMMs) where purely the gain/loss is modulated.\nDespite, in recent years, GLMMs have become more\nand more technologically relevant and accessible, they\nstill do not attract the same interest as PhCs. The\nGLMMs with periodic modulation in one spatial\ndimension (1D) were considered in the context of\ndistributed feedback lasers, where the effects of\nreflections of plane waves from 1D periodic structures is\nstudied [25] [26] [27] . Other examples of 1D GLMMs\nare semiconductor lasers based on multiple quantum\nwells and semiconductor laser arrays [28] [29] ].\nRecently, wave dynamics in 1D parity-time invariant\npotentials has been considered, which can also be\n\n\fregarded as systems with a particular combination of\ngain and refraction index modulation [30] [31] [32] .\nRecently, it has been proposed that GLMMs can\nprovide interesting and technically useful beam\npropagation effects in two dimensional (2D) geometries\n[33] [34] . At the basis of these effects there is a high\nangular anisotropy of the gain/loss; i.e. a strong\ndependence of the gain/loss on the direction of\npropagation of electromagnetic waves. Apart from the\nabove mentioned theoretical numerical approaches [33]\n[34] , no other studies of light beam propagation, neither\ntheoretical nor experimental have been reported in 2D\nGLMMs, to the best of our knowledge.\nThe first reported study on beam shaping effects was\nbased on the paraxial approximation [33] , therefore it\ncannot be directly applicable to GLMMs modulated on a\nwavelength scale, since possible reflections at large\nangles are excluded from the paraxial treatment. The\nbasic predictions of Ref. [33] are: i) self-collimation\n(analogous to the effect observed in PhCs [9] ); ii)\nfocalization by the structure \uf02danalogous to flat-lensing\nin PhCs [14] \uf02d; and iii) high directivity of the gain\n(having no direct correspondence in PhCs). The angular\ndependence of transparency (angular bandgaps), one of\nthe most celebrated properties of PhCs, has also been\nproposed for spatial filtering of monochromatic beams\n[17] [18] . Such directivity in GLMMs has been also\npredicted by plane wave expansion (PWE) calculations\nin [34] . The isofrequency dispersion surfaces, \uf077(k), not\nonly show the distortion of the real part of the\neigenfrequencies, \uf077re(k), but also indicate the\nappearance of sharp peaks in the imaginary part of the\neigenfrequencies, \uf077im(k), which corresponds to an\nanisotropic gain in k-space. The present paper proves the\npredictions of Ref. [34] by numerical integration of the\nfull set of Maxwell's equations using the Finite\nDifference Time Domain (FDTD) method. FDTD\nmethod is used for realistic simulations of light\npropagation through photonic structures, as a design\ntool, and contains no simplifications [35] . We perform\nnumeric simulations in order to evaluate quantitatively\nthe beam propagation effects for square and rhombic 2D\nlattices and, finally, to demonstrate the spatial (angular)\nfiltering of noisy beams.\n2. Model\nWe consider a 2D periodic structure made of lossy\ncylinders with either a square or rhombic (centred\nrectangular) symmetry embedded in an inactive\nbackground (no gain, no loss) as schematically shown in\nFig. 1a and Fig. 1b. Therefore, the structure we\ninvestigate is absorbing on average. If gain is present in\n\nthe structure waves amplitude can grow exponentially to\ninfinity. In this case, nonlinear effects saturating the\n\nFig. 1. (Color online)\nhave direct\n\uf072 The\n\uf072\n\uf072\n\uf072 structures\uf072 considered\nlattice vectors a1 \uf03d a i , a 2 \uf03d a( cos\uf06a i \uf02b s i n\uf06a j ) where \uf06a\uf020=\uf02090o\nfor the square (a) and 60o<\uf06a<90o for a rhombic geometry (b);\nas a particular case we consider \uf06a\uf020=\uf02075o. Figures (c)/(e) and\n(d)/(f) represent the isolines of the real/imaginary frequency,\n\uf077re/\uf077im, of the first band in a square and rhombic lattice,\nrespectively and (g)/(h) represent the real and imaginary\nfrequency of second band of rhombic lattice. The side intensity\nbar indicates real and imaginary parts of frequency in a/\uf06c\nunits, where a is the modulus of the lattice vectors.\n\ngrowth of light intensity should have to be taken into\naccount in FDTD calculations; however, this is out of\nthe scope of this study. For definiteness the radius, R, of\nthe lossy cylinders is fixed to be R\uf020=\uf0200.2*a, where a\ndenotes the lattice constant of the structure, and the\nabsorption coefficient within the cylinders is fixed to be\n\uf061\uf020=\uf02050000\uf020cm-1, which is of the order of magnitude of\nabsorption in semiconductor materials. This corresponds\nto complex-valued refractive index ncyl\uf020=\uf0201+0.3979i. As\nalready mentioned, in order to investigate pure effects\ncaused by the loss-gain modulation the surrounding\nmedium is considered to be air. The real part of the\neigenfrequencies in Fig. 1c and Fig.\uf0201d, correspond to\nfrequencies of the Bloch modes and its imaginary part,\nshown in Fig. 1e and Fig. 1f, corresponds to the net gain\nor loss of each Bloch mode. In GLMMs, the dispersion\ncurves of uncoupled modes do not push each other at the\n\n\fcrossing points to form a band gap (which is the case for\nPhCs), but mutually pull and lock to a common\nfrequency. The wave components at the edge of the first\nBrillouin Zone (BZ) lock to a common frequency to\nform a pattern of maximum gain (or minimum loss).\nThe results throughout the paper contain simulations\nin purely lossy and linear materials, however the main\nconclusions hold for more general GLMMs. Modes with\nthe lowest losses for the case of absorptive GLMMs\ncorrespond to modes with the highest gain for\namplifying GLMMs. Therefore, modes surviving in\nlossy GLMMs, i.e. modes presenting the smallest net\nabsorption have a similar spatial distribution with\nrespect to modes with the highest amplification in a\nGLMM with a net gain.\n3. Results\nIn most of the calculations we consider an input\nfundamental Gaussian light beam with transverse profile\nwaist of 1.5\uf020\uf06dm at the GLMM entrance surface. The\nelectric field is considered to be linearly polarized\nparallel to the incidence plane of the structure; but\nsimilar results can be found for perpendicular\npolarization. In order to monitor the spatial dispersion\nand absorption properties of the GLMM under\ninvestigation, the near field transverse intensity\ndistribution is calculated at a given propagation distance,\nz \uf07e 2 LR, where LR \u2248 7\uf020\u03bcm stands for the Rayleigh\nlength. We then obtain the far field profile by a spatial\nFourier transformation in the transverse direction, and\nwe determine the angular spectrum of absorption. We\nscan the frequency, and expect the most interesting\neffects to be observed at the edges of the 1st BZ, namely\nin the \uf047M direction. As a reference for comparison, we\nalso calculate the propagation of the same input beam\nthrough a homogenous material.\nA typical result for a square structure is shown in\nFig.\uf0202. We note that the antinodes of this particular field\ncorrespond to the areas with minimum losses as\nindicated in Fig.\uf0202e, which ensures the minimum overall\nloss of the Bloch mode. We obtain the complex-valued\nnear field envelope (Fig. 2d) at a fixed distance from the\nentrance surface of the GLMM, indicated as a vertical\nline, D1, in Fig.\uf0202a. Its Fourier transform, as shown Fig.\n2e, exhibits a modulation due to the field harmonics\narising from the periodicity of the GLMM in the\ntransverse direction\n\nFig. 2. (Color online) (a) Light beam propagation inside lossy\nGLMM with square lattice geometry, calculated by FDTD.\nThe magnified view of the electric field shows the modulation\nof the propagated beam in the structure (b), and the shape of\nthe Bloch mode (c). Vertical line D1 in figure (a) represents a\nplane at a distance z\uf020\uf07e 2 LR used to reconstruct the angular\ntransmission function. (d) Spatial distribution along the line\nD1 and (e) its Fourier transform.\n\na square lattice is presented in Fig. 3. We scan the\nfrequencies around the edge of the 1st BZ, M point, and\nnormalise the central part of the far field to the far field\nof a reference beam to obtain the angular transmission\nprofile. The transmission profile, represented in Fig. 3a,\ncan be compared with the imaginary part of the\neigenfrequencies representation shown in Fig.1. The plot\nshows two symmetrically placed areas of minimum\nlosses, above and below the edge of the 1st BZ, which\ndenote the higher transmission angular regions. Such\nregions correspond to the resonance between two\nharmonics as shown in Figs. 3e,g. At the edge of the 1st\nBZ, full resonance is envisaged as all four relevant\ndispersion curves crossing at one point, as schematically\nshown in Fig. 3f. The side bands appearing in the\nspectral far field distributions below and above the M\npoint, Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d, show the anisotropy of the\ngain which also causes the spectral narrowing close to\nthe M point, see Fig. 3c.\nThe red lines in Fig. 3a represent the crossing of plane\nwave's dispersion curves in k x , k y space. Whereas in\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\nPhCs such crossings indicate the appearance of band\ngaps, in GLMMs they coincide with enhanced gain\nareas. These crossing points can be easily located\nregarding the dispersion relations of the nearest\nharmonics. The dispersion relations are given by the\ncircles k x2 \uf02b k y2 \uf03d k 2 for the central harmonic and\n\n\uf028k x \uf0b1 qx \uf0292 \uf02b \uf028k y \uf02d q y \uf0292 \uf03d k 2\n\nfor\n\n\uf028\n\nthe\n\nharmonics, where vector q \uf03d q x , q y\n\n\uf029\n\ntwo\n\nnearest\n\nis given by the\n\n3.1 Angular transmission profile\n\nlattice periodicity. The third nearest harmonic is centred\nat q \uf03d 0, 2q y . The crossing points of the central and\n\nThe angular transmission profile reconstructed from\nthe field distributions behind the GLMM structure with\n\nthe three nearest harmonics are obtained as a function of\nkx :\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\n\fFig. 3.

It is important to note that\nthe narrowing of the far field distribution is more\npronounced for the rhombic geometry than for the\nsquare, as follows from the comparison of Fig. 4c and\nFig. 5c with Fig. 3c.\n\nFig. 4.

In figures (b), (c),\n(d) the far field distributions at D1 are plotted for the\nfrequencies below (0.61), close (0.66) and above (0.70) the K\npoint, as schematically represented in figures (e), (f) and (g)\n\nresults in the sole survival of the nearly on-axis modes,\nfiltering out the high spatial harmonics and making the\ntransverse profile smoother. For the analysis preformed\nin the previous section we infer that the most suitable\nstructure for such purpose is the rhombic. In Fig. 6 the\nfiltering process for a beam propagating along the long\ndiagonal of a rhombic structure is demonstrated. An\ninput beam with a noisy transverse profile is obtained by\npropagation of a Gaussian beam through a diffusive\nstructure. The noisy components that correspond to the\nhigh\nspatial\nfrequencies -or\nhigh\ntransverse\nwavenumber- are gradually filtered out as shown in\nFig. 6b in propagation through a 30 \uf06dm long GLMM.\nTherefore, behind the GLMM structure the light beam\nbecomes of better spatial quality. The propagation of the\nfiltered beam just behind the GLMM through a free\nspace or homogeneous material enhance the filtering\neffect due to the rapid divergence of high spatial\nfrequencies (sidebands in Fig. 6d) imposed by the\nspatial modulation of the material.\n4. Conclusions\n\n3.2 Spatial filtering\nThe high directional gain in the vicinity of the edges of\nthe BZ gives rise to spatial (or angular) filtering effects.\nFor light beams with wave vectors close to the edge of\nthe 1st BZ, the anisotropic loss profile around k\uf05e\uf020=\uf0200\n\nWe have investigated propagation of light beams in\ntwo dimensional structures with periodic gain/loss\nmodulation on a wavelength scale with square and\nrhombic symmetries. By means of FDTD method we\nhave proved highly directive angular gain/loss profiles\n\n\fFig. 5. (Color online) Normalized transmission functions of a\nrhombic GLMM along the \uf047M direction. The solid red curves\ncorrespond to the crossing points of the nearest harmonics\ngiven by eq. 1, which intersect around the frequency 0.85. In\nfigures (b), (c), (d) the far field distributions at D1 are plotted\nfor frequencies below (0.82), close (0.85) and above (0.90)\nsuch point, as schematically represented in figures (e), (f) and\n(g).\n\nin the transmission, according to the predictions under\nparaxial approximation in Ref. [33] . Close to the edges\nof the first BZ, a narrowing of the spatial spectrum is\nobserved. This effect can be related to the coupling and\nlocking of spatial harmonic components propagating\nalong \u0393M direction. Besides, it is demonstrated that\nsuch strong anisotropy of losses can be used for spatial\nfiltering purposes. We demonstrate the effect by filtering\nout the high angular components from the transverse\nprofile of a noisy beam in relatively short propagation\nthrough the GLMM. Although angular narrowing of the\ngain profile is found for both square and rhombic\ngeometries, the spatial filtering results to be more\npronounced for a rhombic geometry and for light beams\npropagating along the long diagonal of the structure.\nThe filtering effect of the GLMM structures\ndemonstrated in this article could be used, for instance,\nto amplify and filter out, by means of optical methods,\nthe information signals (wavelength/s) from the noisy\nbackground in optical communication systems either\nfiber based or free space.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is financially supported by Spanish\nMinisterio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia and European\nFEDER through project FIS2008-06024-C03-02 and by\nCOST action MP0702 from the European Community.\n\nFig. 6.
