In\nthis work, the term stout beer is taken not just to mean a\n\"Very dark, full-bodied hopped beer\"1 but additionally\none which foams due to a combination of dissolved nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Nitrogen is roughly 50 times\nless soluble in water than carbon dioxide and this affects\nthe character of the bubbles and the foam in the head of\nthe beer. One important difference is that while champagne and carbonated beers foam spontaneously, stout\nbeers require special technology to promote foaming.\nIt has been shown theoretically and experimentally\nthat stout beers do foam by the same mechanism as carbonated drinks, but that this occurs at rate too slow to\ngenerate a head in a feasible time. However, the gentle pace of bubble formation in stout beers make them\nan ideal system in which to investigate the physics of\nnucleation both for fundamental research and for undergraduate laboratory projects.\nThe rest of the article is divided up into the following\nsections. Section II summarises the relevant background\nphysics: Henry's law, Laplace's law and nucleation barriers. Section III reviews the experimental evidence that\nthe nucleation sites responsible for bubble formation in\nchampagne and other carbonated drinks are cellulose fibres and describes a mathematical model of this nucleation process. Section IV discusses the unusual properties of stout beers, most of which be attributed to the\nlow solubility of the nitrogen gas dissolved in the beers.\nSection V describes an extension of the mathematical\nmodel of bubble nucleation in champagne to the case of\ntwo gasses and its application to stout beers. The experimental observation of this bubbling mechanism is also\ndescribed. The implications of these results to future\ninvestigations of the science of nucleation and new technologies for promoting foaming in canned and bottled\nstout beers are considered in section VI. Finally, conclu-\n\nsions are given in section VII.\n\nII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn this section we summarise the background physics\nused in this paper, namely Henry's law, which establishes an \"exchange rate\" between the concentration and\npartial pressure of dissolved gasses; Laplace's law, which\nallows us to calculate the overpressure in a gas pocket\ntrapped within a cellulose fibre; Fick's first law, which\nrelates the flux of a dissolved gas to its concentration\ngradient; and the nucleation barrier to bubble formation\nin a supersaturated gas solution. Values of parameters\nused in the text are summarised in Table I.\nTABLE I. Parameters used in the calculations. A range of\nCO2 pressures are used in carbonated beers.

Henry's Law states that \"when a gas dissolves\nthe concentration of the (weak) solution is proportional\nto the gas pressure.\"6 Mathematically, c = HP , where\nc is the concentration of the dissolved gas in solution,\nP is the partial pressure of the gas in equilibrium with\nthe solution and H is a constant of proportionality, the\nHenry's Law constant. Note that the units of c may be\ntaken as mol m\u22123 (this work) or as kg m\u22123 and that\nHenry's law may also be stated as P = H \u2032 c (where H \u2032 =\nH \u22121 ) in textbooks. As noted in the definition, Henry's\nlaw only applies to weak (dilute) solutions, but it is valid\nfor the range of pressures used in this paper.\nb. Laplace's Law states that the pressure difference\n\u0001\nacross a curved surface is equal to \u03b3 R1\u22121 + R2\u22121 where\n\u03b3 is the surface tension of the interface and R1 and R2\nare the principal radii of curvature of the interface.7 For\na spherical bubble of radius r, R1 = R2 = r and the\npressure, PB , inside the bubble is given by\nPB = P0 +\n\n2\u03b3\n,\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P0 is atmospheric pressure. This expression is also\nvalid for the pressure in a gas pocket trapped within a\ncellulose fibre, where r is taken to be the radius of the\nspherical caps at the ends of the gas pocket.\nc. Fick's First Law describes the flux of a dissolved\nchemical. Fick's first law is that the flux Q is proportional to the gradient of the concentration, c, with constant of proportionality \u2212D\nQ = \u2212D\u2207c,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, since D > 0, the minus sign ensures that the flux\nis directed from regions of high concentration to regions\nof low concentration.\nd. Critical Radius Using Henry's law, Laplace's law\nand Fick's first law we can understand why there is a\nnucleation barrier to the growth of bubbles.6 Consider\na supersaturated gas solution in which the dissolved gas\nis at a concentration c = HP , where the pressure P of\nthe gas in equilibrium with the solution is greater than\natmospheric pressure P0 . Now consider the concentration\nof that dissolved gas cB at the surface of a bubble. We\nexpect this concentration to be in local equilibrium with\nthe gas in the bubble\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03b3\ncB = HPB = H P0 +\n.\n(3)\nr\nIn order for the bubble to grow, gas must flow from the\nbulk of the liquid into the bubble but, by Fick's first law,\nthis will only occur if c > cB . Inspection of equation 3\nshows that this is not guaranteed simply because the solution is supersaturated, P > P0 , but a condition on the\nsize of the bubble must also be met. The size of the\nbubble must exceed a critical radius rC given by\nrC =\n\n2\u03b3\n.\nP \u2212 P0\n\n(4)\n\nIn other words, for champagne to effervesce and for beer\nto foam, bubbles larger than this critical radius must\nsomehow be created. Bubbles for which r > rC are\nknown as post-critical nuclei. Note that the critical radius was derived using purely mechanical arguments, its\nvalue is a function only of the total pressure of dissolved\ngasses in solution independent of, for example, their solubility. In the subsequent sections we will discuss how\nthis nucleation barrier is overcome in practise.\n\nIII.\n\nBUBBLE NUCLEATION IN CHAMPAGNE\n\nIn this paper we take champagne as an example of\na drink in which bubbles form due to dissolved carbon\ndioxide. This is because champagne is the most studied of\nall carbonated beverages, although the results described\nbelow are directly applicable to other carbonated drinks.\nIt has been known for some time that the spontaneous\nnucleation of bubbles in carbonated drinks is strongly\ninhibited.8 As was discussed in the previous section, only\nbubbles above a critical radius will grow, and for gas\npressures of less than one hundred atmospheres, the rate\nof spontaneous production of these post-critical bubbles\neither in bulk liquid or on surfaces in contact with the\nbulk liquid (suspended particles or the container walls)\nis practically zero.9 Since the pressure of dissolved gasses\nin champagne is a little over six atmospheres this mechanism can be ruled out. Nevertheless, champagne and\nother carbonated drinks do produce bubbles so an alternative mechanism must be in play. This is now known to\nbe the nucleation of bubbles by gas pockets. A gas pocket\nof post-critical size will grow due to diffusion of carbon\ndioxide from solution into the pocket. When the pocket\nexceeds some limiting size a bubble detaches, leaving behind the original, postcritical gas pocket. The process\nof growth and detachment repeats resulting in trains of\nbubbles rising to the surface. This is known as type IV\nnucleation.9\nUntil relatively recently it was thought that these gas\npockets were held in imperfections on the surfaces of\nglasses. However, examination of the surface topography of glasses shows that the lengthscales of such imperfections are too small for gas pockets trapped within\nthem to exceed the critical nucleus size. Microscopic observation of the sites on champagne glasses from which\ntrains of bubbles emerge reveal that the gas pockets are\ntrapped within cellulose fibres as shown in Figure 1.10\nThe cellulose fibres will have either fallen into the glass\nfrom suspension in the air or been shed by the cloth used\nto wipe the glass dry.\nNote that imperfections of a glass surface can nucleate\nbubbles: indeed champagne glasses with artificial cavities designed to promote nucleation are available.11 But\nin a glass lacking these artificial cavities, cellulose fibres\nare more numerous and more efficient nucleators of bubbles. No bubbles will form in glass with a smooth surface\nthat has been cleaned with chromic acid solution (which\n\n\f3\ndestroys cellulose and other organic materials).12\n\nFIG. 1. Geometry of a gas pocket trapped in a cellulose fibre.\nThe fibre is hollow and contains both a trapped gas pocket\nand fluid.\n\nThe mechanism of bubble formation by a gas pocket\ntrapped in a cellulose fibre is illustrated in Figure 2. A\ncylindrical gas pocket trapped in a cellulose fibre grows\nby diffusion of dissolved gasses into the pocket. As\nsoon as the pocket reaches the mouth of the fibre it becomes unstable and a bubble breaks off. There are two\ntimescales to the process: the timescale of growth of the\ngas pocket which is relatively slow and the timescale of\ndetachment of the bubble, which is fast. It is difficult to\nsay exactly how fast the detachment process is. Movies\nof nucleation events have so far failed to resolve it. The\ntheory presented below2 predicts the exponential growth\nof the gas pocket, and the time constant of that exponential growth is taken as an estimate of the bubbling\ntime.\nA mathematical model of bubble nucleation by a cellulose fibre can be developed as follows.2 The rate of change\nof the amount N1 (in mol) of carbon dioxide within the\ngas pocket can be written in terms of fluxes of carbon\ndioxide through the walls of the fibre, QW , and through\nthe spherical caps at the ends of the gas pocket, QSC , as\nshown in Figure 3,\ndN1\n= 4\u03c0r2 QSC + 2\u03c0rzQW .\ndt\n\nFIG. 2. Nucleation of a bubble by a gas pocket trapped in\na cellulose fibre. Although the images taken here are from\nstout beer, the mechanism is exactly the same in carbonated\nliquids. The process of bubble formation has two stages: the\nslow growth of the gas pocket and the fast detachment of a\nbubble.\n\nto the bulk concentration c1 .10 This allows us to estimate\nQSC = D1\n\n(6)\n\nThe diffusion length \u03bb cannot be measured independently\nso in practise its value is calculated by working backwards\nfrom measured nucleation rates.2\nThe second modelling assumption is used to estimate\nthe flux of carbon dioxide through the walls of the fibre.\nThe porous walls of the fibre allow diffusion of carbon\ndioxide but at a reduced rate.13 This can be modelled by\nusing the same diffusion length as before and replacing\nD1 by D1\u22a5 \u2248 0.2D1 .2 This allows QW to be estimated\nas\nQW = D1\u22a5\n\n(c1 \u2212 cB )\nD1\u22a5 H1\n=\n(P1 \u2212 PB ) .\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n(7)\n\nSubstituting the above expressions for QSC and QW into\nequation 5 and using the ideal gas equation,\n\n(5)\n\nTwo modelling assumptions are used to estimate QSC\nand QW .

The rate of growth of the gas pocket can be calculated\nin terms of QSC , the flux of carbon dioxide molecules through\nthe spherical caps at the ends of the gas pocket and QW , the\nflux through the walls of the cellulose fibre into the gas pocket.\n\nFIG. 4. The diffusion fluxes QSC (shown) and QW are estimated by introducing a diffusion length \u03bb over which the\ncarbon dioxide concentration c varies from the concentration\nin equilibrium with the gas pocket cB to the concentration in\nthe bulk liquid c1 .2\n\nIntegrating this equation with initial condition z = z0\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n2D1\n2D1\nt\n\u2212\nz = z0 +\nr exp\nr\nD1\u22a5\n\u03c4\nD1\u22a5\nr\u03bbPB\n\u03c4=\n2RT H1D1\u22a5 (P1 \u2212 PB )\n\u0012\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c4 , the timescale of exponential growth of gas\npocket, is also a good estimate of the time to create\na bubble.2 Substituting in values for champagne gives\n\u03c4 = 0.04 s, and for carbonated beers \u03c4 = 0.08 s.\n\nBUBBLES IN STOUT BEERS\n\nThere are a number of advantages to using a gas mixture including a large partial pressure of nitrogen in\nbeers. Replacing carbon dioxide with nitrogen changes\nthe taste of the beer and the texture of the head.1 Unlike\ncarbon dioxide, nitrogen is not acidic in solution, giving\nstout beers a smoother, less bitter taste. The lower solubility of nitrogen results in smaller bubbles: these give\nthe head of a stout a creamy mouthfeel. The low solubility of nitrogen ensures that the head of a stout beer lasts\nmuch longer that of a carbonated beer.3\nThe small bubble size is responsible for the famous\nsinking bubbles in stout beers. Drag forces (\u221d r2 ) dominate buoyancy forces (\u221d r3 ) when bubbles are small and\nso bubbles are dragged downwards at the sides of the\nglass by the circulation of the beer.4 A uniform downwards flow of bubbles is unstable and so the bubbles cascade down in waves mathematically equivalent to the roll\nwaves that form in rapidly flowing shallow water.14\nAll the advantages of adding nitrogen come at a price:\nstout beers do not foam as readily as carbonated beers.\nThe act of poring a carbonated beer is enough to generate\na head. This is not the case for stout beers. Special technology is needed to promote foaming in stout beers. In\ndraught form the beer is forced at high pressure through\na narrow aperture. In cans widgets are used. A widget\nis a hollow ball filled with gas at the same pressure as\nthe can. When the can is opened and the headspace depressurises, the widget also depressurises, but can only\ndo so through a small submerged nozzle. The widget releases a turbulent gas jet into the canned beer. The gas\njet rapidly breaks up into the hundred million or so bubble nuclei needed to form the head. The stirring of the\nbeer generated firstly by the turbulent jet and secondly\nby pouring the beer into the glass ensures that the bubble nuclei mix with the beer, scavenging all the dissolved\nnitrogen and carbon dioxide gasses from solution.\n\nV.\n\nNUCLEATION OF BUBBLES IN STOUT\nBEERS\n\nIt is interesting to ask why this special technology is\nneeded. The fibre nucleation model developed for carbonated liquids can be adapted for stout beers and used\nto investigate why the cellulose fibre nucleation mechanism is insufficient to generate a head.15 The gas pocket\nin a fibre immersed in stout beer will be at the same total pressure, PB , as before, since this only depends on\nsurface tension and geometry. If the amount of carbon\ndioxide in the gas pocket is N1 and the amount of nitrogen is N2 then the partial pressures of carbon dioxide\nand nitrogen in the bubble will be given by\nPB1 =\n\nN1\nPB\nN1 + N2\n\nPB2 =\n\nN2\nPB ,\nN1 + N2\n\n(12)\n\n\f5\nSubstituting for the fluxes into equation 14 and 15\ngives\n\u0001\nH1\ndN1\n=\n4\u03c0r2 D1 + 2\u03c0rzD1\u22a5\ndt\n\u03bb\n\u0012\n\nPB N1\nN1 + N2\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\n\u0001\nH2\ndN2\n4\u03c0r2 D2 + 2\u03c0rzD2\u22a5\n=\ndt\n\u03bb\n\u0012\n\nPB N2\nN1 + N2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nP1 \u2212\n\nP2 \u2212\n\nFIG. 5. In a stout beer the rate of growth of a gas pocket\nin a cellulose fibre depends on the flux of carbon dioxide and\nnitrogen into the gas pocket.

Figure 6 shows the numerical solution with initial conditions\nN1 = 0 and N2 = 0.5, compared with the asymptotic solution. Fitting the numerical solution for 5 < t < 10\nto an exponential curve gives a dimensionless bubbling\ntimescale of \u03c4 = 0.47 and a dimensional timescale of\n\u03c4 tscale = 1.28 s. In other words the cellulose fibre nucleation mechanism in stout beers is about 15 times slower\nthan in carbonated beers and about 30 times slower than\nin champagne. This, coupled with the fact that the small\nbubble size in stout beers means that many more bubbles\nare needed to make the head, demonstrates why extra\ntechnology is needed to form heads on stout beers.\nB.\n\nExperimental Observation\n\nThe model prediction that cellulose fibres can\nnucleate bubbles in stout beers can be confirmed\nexperimentally.15,17 The first ingredient is stout beer containing dissolved gasses. If a canned stout is opened normally, the widget will trigger foaming and the dissolved\ngasses will end up in the head of the beer, while the\nbeer itself will no longer be supersaturated. To avoid\nthis happening the can must be opened slowly so that\nthe headspace of the can and the widget decompress at\nsimilar rates. This will prevent the widget from creating\na large number of small bubble nuclei and from stirring\nthe liquid.\nOne procedure for doing this is to put a small amount\nof bluetack or other putty-like substance (to create a seal)\non the top of the can and then pierce the can through\nthe bluetack with a pushpin. Be careful and wear eye\nprotection while doing so. Allow gas to escape slowly\n\nFIG. 6. Asymptotic (black line) and numerical (grey line)\nsolution of equations 27 and 28. (a) Shows the growth of\nthe gas pocket, (b) the mole fraction of carbon dioxide in the\nbubble. The asymptotic solution assumes that the carbon\ndioxide in the bubble is in equilibrium with the solution and\noverestimates the growth rate of the gas pocket.\n\nthrough the hole: leave the pin in place but enlarge the\nhole slightly by wobbling it. It should take at least a\nminute to decompress the can. The pressure in the head\nspace can be monitored by squeezing the sides of the can.\nOnce the head space has reached atmospheric pressure,\nthe pin can be removed. Open the can normally with\nthe ringpull. Extract supersaturated stout beer from the\nbottom of the can with an eyedropper.\nIf at this point the can is poured into a beer glass\nthen no head will form and no bubbling will be visible:\nthe beer will be similar in appearance to flat cola. A\nstrong light directed upwards from the base of the glass\nmay reveal a few bubble trains nucleated by (invisible)\ncellulose fibres.\nFigure 7 shows the experimental setup used to visualise\nbubble nucleation by fibres.17 Stout beer is carefully (to\nminimise agitation) transferred into a shallow container\nin which a source of cellulose fibres has been glued to the\nbase. Laboratory filter paper may be used as the source\nof the fibres although coffee filter paper works equally\nwell. The fibres are observed through a transmitted light\nmicroscope. This setup should be compared with the\nsignificantly more sophisticated apparatus needed to investigate bubble nucleation in champagne.18\nFigure 8 shows several stills from a movie of the nucleation of bubbles by a fibre. If an unusually large fibre\nis viewed, as in Figure 2 the growth of the gas pocket\n\n\f7\n\nDSLR Camera\nattached to Computer\nPhototube\n\nObjective Lens\nStout Beer\n\nx\nx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx\nx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nCellulose\nFibres\n\nLight Source\n\nFIG. 7. Experimental setup.17 Stout beer is poured into a\nshallow container holding cellulose fibres. The nucleation of\nbubbles is viewed through a transmitted light microscope.\nA digital camera is used to record movies of the nucleation\nevents.\n\nand the formation of the bubble can be seen very clearly.\nThe length of the gas pocket (z) shown in Figure 2 can\nbe measured as a function of time using edge detection.\nThe results are shown in Figure 9. This shows the steady\ngrowth of the gas pocket, as predicted by the model, and\nthe rapid detachment of the bubble (seen as an almost\ninstantaneous contraction of the gas pocket) as assumed\nby the model.\n\nVI.\n\nFIG. 8. Nucleation of bubbles observed by the experimental\nequipment shown in Figure 7. The figures show (1) a gas\npocket trapped in the fibre, (2) a bubble created when the air\npocket exceeds a critical size, and (3) a bubble growing while\nattached to the fibre. The scale bar is 50 \u03bcm. (a) The air\npocket (1) has just reached critical size. (b) The air pocket (1)\nhas created a bubble (2). (c) Bubble (2) has visibly detached\nfrom the fibre.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nOne interesting result from the experimental observation of bubble nucleation in stout beers is that it is much\neasier to study than in carbonated liquids. The experimental setup described above cannot be used to investigate bubble nucleation in carbonated liquids. The larger\nbubble size typical of carbonated liquids leads to agitation of the liquid, moving the fibres under observation in\nand out of the plane of focus. Also bubbles in some carbonated liquids rupture into a fine spray of droplets at\nthe surface19 which coat the objective lens of the microscope, distorting the images. Stout beers therefore are\nan ideal model system for fundamental research on the\nfibre nucleation mechanism.\nThe experimental setup is also accessible for undergraduate laboratory projects. A very minimal set of\nequipment is needed and good pictures can be obtained\n\nFIG. 9. Plots of length, z, of the gas pocket shown in Figure 2\nas a function of time. The gas pocket grows slowly, then\nrapidly contracts as a bubble is created.\n\neven with an entry level microscope. Figure 10 shows\npictures taken with a usb microscope sold as a promotional item at a local supermarket. The images are good\n\n\f8\nsuch a widget may be feasible.\n\nVII.\n\nFIG. 10. Images of bubble nucleation in stout beer by cellulose fibres captured with an entry level usb microscope. Despite the unsophisticated equipment, the gas pocket (1) and\nnucleated bubbles (2) can be visualised.\n\nenough to observe the gas pockets within individual fibres as well as the formation of bubbles. Were it not\nfor the alcoholic nature of the supersaturated solution,\nthese experiments would also be suitable for school science experiments. Unfortunately, as noted above, it is\nmuch harder to obtain similar results using carbonated\nsoft drinks.\nThe fact that cellulose fibres are capable of nucleating\nbubbles in stout beers leads to the interesting question\nof whether an alternative widget design based on coating the inside of a bottle or can with fibres would be\nfeasible.15 The head of a stout beer should contain approximately 108 bubbles. In order to produce these 108\nbubbles in the 30 s it takes to pour a stout beer from the\ncan into a glass, we require 4.3 \u00d7 106 fibres (each producing one bubble every 1.28 s). If the fibres are arranged\nperpendicular to the surface they are attached to, each fibre occupying an area of \u03bb2 , the total area needed is then\n2\n8.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2 \u2248 (3 cm) .

Stout beers do not foam\nspontaneously and require special technology to promote\nfoaming, such as the widget found in cans of stout beers.\nHowever, theory and experiment shows that the same\ncellulose fibre nucleation mechanism that causes foaming in carbonated liquids is also active in stout beers,\nbut at a greatly reduced rate. The slow nucleation and\ngrowth rate of bubbles makes stout beers an ideal system in which to study nucleation, bringing the study of\nnucleation within the reach of undergraduate laboratory\nequipment. In the future, coatings of fibres could be\napplied to the inside of stout beer cans as a widget replacement. Future research may focus on developing a\nbetter understanding of the physics behind the empirical\ndiffusion length \u03bb and the bubble detachment process.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge support of the Mathematics\nApplications Consortium for Science and Industry\n(http://www.macsi.ul.ie) funded by the Science\nFoundation Ireland Mathematics Initiative Grant\n06/MI/005.\nMGD acknowledges funding from the\nIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and\nTechnology (IRCSET).\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nL.
