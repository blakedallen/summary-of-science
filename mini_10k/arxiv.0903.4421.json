Introduction\nThe elaboration of the QCD phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon density\nrepresents a great challenge in modern particle and nuclear physics. It has been studied\nexperimentally at the RHIC collider at Brookhaven and at CERN. It has also attracted\nintense theoretical investigation using computer simulations in the context of lattice gauge\ntheory and random matrix theory [1]. A significant computational obstacle is the so-called\nsign problem, for which a number of approximate techniques have been developed: (i) a\nTaylor expansion with respect to the baryon chemical potential [2, 3, 4]; (ii) imaginary\nvalues for the chemical potential \u03bc [5, 6, 7]; (iii) overlap enhancing techniques [8]. Despite\nthese impressive successes, our knowledge of the QCD phase diagram is still rather limited.\nOther approaches include the study of QCD-like theories such as 2-colour QCD [9, 10,\n11], and high density quark matter in a colour superconducting state [12, 13, 14, 15,\n16]. Of particular interest is the identification of inhomogeneous phases, analogous to the\nLOFF states of condensed matter systems [17, 18, 19, 16, 20]. This idea has been studied\ndeeply for Skyrme models [21, 22, 23, 24], and for four-fermion models [25, 26, 20]. Lower\ndimensional models also provide insight into chiral dynamics, and early lattice studies of\nlower-dimensional models such as the Gross Neveu model in the limit of many flavours have\nshown that inhomogeneous background fields are key to understand the dense phase [27].\nRecently, this model has attracted a lot of interest since it was found analytically that the\nhigh-density state of fermion matter forms an inhomogeneous \"baryon crystal\" [28, 29, 30,\n31]. This analytic crystalline phase has been confirmed by a lattice analysis [32], and such\nstudies have led to several new insights concerning inhomogeneous phases [33, 34].\nGood chiral properties of the fermion action is of central importance for an investigation\nof quark matter at intermediate densities, since the high-density transition is driven by\nchiral dynamics. Unfortunately, lattice fermion actions necessarily suffer from the fermion\ndoubling problem as firstly pointed out by Nielsen and Ninomiya [35]. Nowadays, staggered\nfermions [36], domain wall fermions [37] or Neuberger fermions [38], which are an explicit\nrealization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation [39], are widely used in numerical simulations.\nDespite these advanced formulations and great numerical efforts, it turns out still to be\ncumbersome to achieve good chiral properties, such as a sufficiently small pion mass.\nHere we propose to use the worldline approach to study interacting fermion systems.\nSince the worldline approach to the quark determinant does not use a lattice discretization\nof space-time, it circumvents many of these significant difficulties. Here, we will argue\nthat the prospects of the worldline approach are (i) exact chiral symmetry but yet a fully\nnumerical approach, (ii) analytic renormalization and (iii) a clear description of Fermi\nsurface effects. The worldline method is a string-inspired approach to quantum field theory;\nsee [40, 41] for reviews. It was further developed into a viable tool for an efficient calculation\nof functional determinants for arbitrary background fields [42]. Subsequently, worldline\nnumerics has enjoyed a wide span of applications ranging from the Casimir effect [43, 44]\nand fermion induced quantum interactions [45] to the description of pair production in\ninhomogeneous fields [46, 47]. A worldline lattice formulation has also been presented in\n[48].\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fIn this paper we apply a worldline Monte Carlo approach to interacting fermion models,\nconcentrating on the (1 + 1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model [49, 50]. We review these\nmodels in Section 2, and describe the worldline representation of the effective action. The\ntreatment of inhomogeneous condensates is presented in Section 3, and the extension to\nfinite temperature and chemical potential is explained in Section 3, along with results of the\ncomputations. Section 5 contains our conclusions, and several appendices contain relevant\ntechnical details.\n\n2. Worldline representation of the effective action\n2.1 Continuum formulation\nIn this work, we mainly concentrate on the the D = 1 + 1 dimensional Gross-Neveu (GN)\nmodel defined by the Euclidean fermionic action [49, 50]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ng2\nD\n2\nSF = d x \u2212\u03c8\u0304\u2202/\u03c8 +\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8) ,\n(2.1)\n2Nf\n\nwhere Nf denotes the number of flavors. The GN model has a discrete chiral symmetry\nunder \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b35 \u03c8. Our conventions for the Dirac algebra in D = 1 + 1 are \u03b31 = i\u03c33 , \u03b32 = i\u03c31 ,\n\u03b35 = \u03c32 , {\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd } = \u22122\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd , but most of the equations below generalize straightforwardly\nto higher dimensions. With the aid of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we can\nrewrite this model in terms of a mixed fermionic-bosonic action\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nNf 2\nD\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304\u2202/\u03c8 \u2212 i\u03c3 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\n(2.2)\nSFB = d x\n2g2\n\nwith the bosonic scalar \u03c3(x) which transforms as \u03c3 \u2192 \u2212\u03c3 under the discrete chiral symmetry. In this work, we actually confine ourselves strictly to the large-Nf limit of this model\nwhich is equivalent to a semiclassical approximation of the \u03c3 sector. Integrating out the\nremaining fermion fluctuations, results in the large-Nf effective action\nZ\nNf\n\u0393[\u03c3] = dD x 2 \u03c3 2 \u2212 Nf Tr ln(\u2212\u2202/ \u2212 i\u03c3), Nf \u2192 \u221e.\n(2.3)\n2g\n\nThe resulting Dirac operator D = i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3 has a \u03b35 hermiticity, D \u2020 = \u03b35 D\u03b35 , implying that\nthe fermionic contribution to \u0393 is real. In this case, we can use the identity Tr ln iD =\n1\n\u2020\n2 Tr ln DD to obtain\nZ\nNf\nNf\nTr ln(\u2212\u2202 2 + \u03c3 2 \u2212 i\u2202/\u03c3), Nf \u2192 \u221e,\n(2.4)\n\u0393[\u03c3] = dD x 2 \u03c3 2 \u2212\n2g\n2\n\nnow involving a fluctuation operator of Laplace type.\nA variety of fermionic models of a similar type exist. An example for a model with a\ncontinuous chiral symmetry is given by the Thirring model which is discussed in appendix\nA. Here, we concentrate on the Gross-Neveu model. The contribution from the fermion\nfluctuations to the effective action can be written in propertime form,\nNf\n(2.5)\n\u2206\u0393[\u03c3] := \u2212 Tr ln(\u2212\u2202 2 + \u03c3 2 \u2212 i\u2202/\u03c3)\n2Z\nNf \u221e dT\n2\n2\nTr e\u2212(\u2212\u2202 +\u03c3 \u2212i\u2202/\u03c3)T ,\n(2.6)\n=\n2 1/\u039b2 T\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fwhere we have used a propertime UV cutoff \u039b for the sake of definiteness; any other\nregularization scheme can similarly be implemented. Interpreting the fluctuation operator\nin the exponent as a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian H, we can introduce the path\nintegral representation of the propertime evolution operator exp(\u2212HT ),\n1\nNf\n\u2206\u0393[\u03c3] =\nd\u03b3\n2 (4\u03c0)D/2\n\nZ\u221e\n\n1/\u039b2\n\ndT\nT D/2+1\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nDx e\u2212 4\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b2 (\u03c4 ) \u2212\n\ne\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u03c32\n\n\u03a6[\u03c3],\n\n(2.7)\n\nx(0)=x(T )\n\ncontaining the spin factor\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z T\n1\n\u03a6[\u03c3] =\nd\u03c4 (\u2202/\u03c3 ) ,\ntr\u03b3 P exp i\nd\u03b3\n0\n\n(2.8)\n\nand \u03c3 are functions of x(\u03c4 ). The normalization of the path integral in Eq. (2.7) has been\nR\nR\nchosen such that Dx exp(\u2212 \u1e8b2 /4) = 1. We also introduced the dimensionality of the\nDirac algebra d\u03b3 , e.g., d\u03b3 = 2D/2 in even dimensions, such that \u03a6[0] = 1.\n2.2 Propertime discretization\nFor a given background of arbitrarily varying \u03c3 and V fields, the analytic computation of the\neffective action \u0393 is formidable. For a numerical computation, the worldline representation\nis highly useful, since the computation of the path integral in Eqs. (2.7) or (A.5) can\nbe done efficiently with Monte Carlo methods. Most importantly, the algorithm can be\nformulated for any background \u03c3 in full generality.\nAn estimate for the path integral over an operator O[x] is given by an average over a\nfinite ensemble of closed worldlines (\"loops\") xl (\u03c4 ), where l = 1, . . . , nL .\nZ\n\n\u2212 14\n\nDx O[x] e\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b2 (\u03c4 )\n\nnL\n1 X\n\u2261 hO[x]i \u2243\nO[xl ].\nnL\n\n(2.9)\n\nl=1\n\nx(0)=x(T )\n\nSince the path integral is over all spacetime, it can be decomposed into a spacetime integral\nover a \"center of mass\" (CM) and a path integral over worldlines fixed to this common\ncenter of mass,\nZ\nhO[x]i =\n\ndD xCM hO[x]ixCM\n\n(2.10)\n\nThis latter ensemble of mass-centered worldlines xl is generated according to a Gaussian\nvelocity distribution\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ T\nR\n1 T\n2\n(2.11)\nd\u03c4 x(\u03c4 ) e\u2212 4 0 d\u03c4 \u1e8b (\u03c4 ) ,\nPCM [x] = \u03b4 xCM \u2212\n0\n\nwhere the \u03b4 function implements the center-of-mass constraint. The center-of-mass integration relates the effective action with a corresponding action density, i.e., the Lagrangian,\nR\n\u0393 = dD xCM L(xCM ), but this decomposition of the worldlines is not unique. Alternatively, the worldlines in the ensemble can be fixed to have one common point (CP), say at\n\u03c4 = 0,\nR\n1 T\n2\nPCP [x] = \u03b4 (xCP \u2212 x(\u03c4 = 0)) e\u2212 4 0 d\u03c4 \u1e8b (\u03c4 ) ,\n(2.12)\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fR\nR\ne CP ),\nsuch that hO[x]i = dD xCP hO[x]ixCP . The associated Lagrangian L, \u0393 = dD xCP L(x\nis not identical to the one related to the center-of-mass definition, but agrees with it up to\na total derivative term [40]. Below, we use both prescriptions: whereas the CM worldlines\nR\nhave some computational advantages due to the constraint x(\u03c4 ) = 0, analytical results\nare often related to the representation involving CP worldlines.\nThe finite ensemble of worldline loops still has an infinite set of degrees of freedom. We\nreduce these to finitely many by a discretization of the propertime coordinate \u03c4 , resulting\nin an approximation of each worldline by a finite set of N points per loop, xi := x(\u03c4i ), \u03c4i =\nT i/N , i = 0, . . . , N , where the points xi=0 \u2261 xi=N are identified. Replacing the propertime\nderivative in the worldline action by a nearest-neighbor difference, \u1e8b(\u03c4i ) \u2192 N (xi \u2212xi\u22121 )/T ,\nleads to a Gaussian action for the xi which can be diagonalized including the \u03b4 constraint.\nThis allows for an ab-initio generation of a random worldline distribution; for concrete\nalgorithms, see [43, 51]. A discretization in terms of Fourier modes is also possible and\nwill be used in Sect. 3.6; it shows a slightly slower convergence towards the propertime\ncontinuum limit [43].\nWhereas the finiteness of the number of worldlines introduces an error which is measurable by the statistical error of the expectation values, the propertime discretization leads\nto a systematic error which has to be studied by approaching the continuum limit, i.e., by\nincreasing the value of N .\nIt should be stressed that only the auxiliary propertime is discretized, whereas the\nspacetime coordinates remain continuous, xi \u2208 D (at least to machine accuracy). Therefore, there is neither a fermion doubling problem nor is the algorithm restricted to certain\nvalues of the flavor number Nf ; in fact, Nf can even be a continuous number.\nAnother advantage of the worldline numerical approach is given by the fact that chiral\nsymmetries can manifestly be preserved. For instance in the case of the Thirring model\n[discussed in more detail in Appendix A], the SU(Nf )R \u00d7 SU(Nf )L remains unaffected also\nin the discretized version of the worldline approach. This is because the derivation of\nthe worldline representation is completely done in the continuum, each step preserving\nthe chiral properties of the Dirac operator. The final worldline expression (A.5) hence is\nmanifestly chirally invariant. Discretizing the propertime does not spoil this invariance;\nmoreover, spacetime remains continuous even after propertime discretization. Even if we\ndecided to discretize the worldline integrals by constraining them to form chains of links\non a spacetime lattice, chiral symmetry would not be violated, since such a discretization\nwould not correspond to a lattice Dirac operator. We conclude that the numerical worldline\nMonte Carlo estimate for the effective action respects chiral invariance, has no doubling\nproblem and can be used for any number of flavors Nf .\n\nR\n\n2.3 Renormalization\nRenormalization of these fermionic models in the large-Nf limit can be done in the standard\nfashion, using, e.g., Coleman-Weinberg renormalization conditions to fix physical parameters. The large-Nf limit even facilitates renormalization in any dimension D, requiring,\nof course, an increasing number of counter terms corresponding to physical parameters for\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fincreasing D.1\nIn practice, however, renormalization can become an issue if the computation is done\nnumerically, since divergent pieces have to be separated from the physical quantities in a\nwell-controlled manner. Therefore, we briefly outline the renormalization process in the\nfollowing in order to demonstrate that the renormalization can be done analytically first\nin our formalism, such that numerics has to deal only with the remaining finite parts. For\nsimplicity, we confine ourselves to D = 1 + 1 in the Gross-Neveu model but the same\nstrategy can be applied also in the case of other fermionic models.\nThe unrenormalized large-Nf effective action in the Gross-Neveu model reads\n\u0393[\u03c3] =\n\nZ\n\nNf\nNf\nd2 x 2 \u03c3 2 +\n(4\u03c0)\n2g\u039b\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndT\nT2\n\n1/\u039b2\n\nZ\n\nd2 xhe\u2212\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u03c32\n\n\u03a6[\u03c3] \u2212 1ix ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere we have already included the free-field subtraction, such that \u0393[\u03c3 = 0] = 0, and\nlabeled the bare coupling with a subscript \u039b. A logarithmic cutoff dependence is generated\nfrom the small-T limit of the propertime integrand. The small-T expansion of the worldline\nexpectation value, which corresponds to the heat-kernel expansion, yields\nhe\u2212\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u03c32\n\n\u03a6[\u03c3] \u2212 1ix = \u2212\u03c3 2 (x)T + O(T 2 ),\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere only the term linear in T supports a log \u039b divergence. This divergence corresponds\nto the local counter term proportional to the bare action and can be absorbed by a coupling renormalization. We fix the physical coupling at the renormalization scale \u03bc by a\nrenormalization condition of Coleman-Weinberg type:\n\u03b42 \u0393[\u03c3]\n\u03b4\u03c3 2\n\n=\n\u03c3=\u03bc\n\nNf\n.\ng2 (\u03bc)\n\n(2.15)\n\nInserting Eq. (2.13), this relates the bare to the renormalized coupling,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bc2\n= 2 +\nC + 2 + ln 2 ,\ng(\u03bc)2\n\u039b\ng\u039b 2\u03c0\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere C denotes the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Also the \u03b2 function can be read off, \u03b2g2 \u2261\n\u03bc\u2202\u03bc g(\u03bc)2 = \u2212 \u03c01 g(\u03bc)4 . The finite parts are specific to our propertime cutoff regularization;\nof course, any other desired regularization method can also be used, such that the final\nnumerical results can be mapped to any given regularization scheme.\nThe renormalization scale and the coupling can be traded for an RG invariant mass\nscale, manifesting dimensional transmutation. A convenient choice is given by the minimum\nm of the effective action which is directly related to the induced fermion mass,\n\u03b4\u0393\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\n=0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u2212\n\nm = \u03bce\n\n\u03c0\n+1\ng(\u03bc)2\n\n.\n\n(2.17)\n\n\u03c3=m,\u039b\u2192\u221e\n\n1\n\nBeyond the large-Nf limit, the models are perturbatively renormalizable in D = 1 + 1. For instance in\nD = 2 + 1, they are even nonperturbatively renormalizable owing to the occurrence of a non-Gaussian fixed\npoint, as can be proven, e.g., to all order in a 1/Nf expansion [52, 25].\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fExpressing the bare coupling in terms of the renormalized coupling and successively in\nterms of the minimum m, leads us to the final renormalized form of the effective action,\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\u221e\n2\nRT\nNf\n2\n2\n\u03c3\ndT\n\u0393[\u03c3] =\n(2.18)\nhe\u2212 0 d\u03c4 \u03c3 \u03a6[\u03c3]ix \u2212 2 (e\u2212m T \u2212 1) \u2212 1 \uf8fb ,\nd2 x \uf8f0\u2212\u03c3 2 +\n4\u03c0\nT2\nm\n0\n\nwhich holds for any given background \u03c3(x). Note that the worldline expectation value\nthat is to be computed numerically is finite. Together with the subtraction terms, also\nthe propertime integral is finite in the limit\n\u039b \u2192 \u221e, which we have performed already in\nR\n2\n\u2212 0T d\u03c4 \u03c32\n\u03a6[\u03c3]ix = e\u2212\u03c3 T , and the effective action can\nEq.

(2.18) is not only conceptually satisfactory,\nbut also useful from a practical viewpoint, since the minimum m which sets the physical\nscale is under control analytically, cf. Eq. (2.19). For the remainder of this subsection, we\nbriefly consider an alternative but equally valid choice of the scale.\nThe disadvantage of the above scale fixing lies in the fact that m is determined from the\nminimum of the full effective action, which happens to be at \u03c3 =constant in the large-Nf\nlimit. In the general case, e.g., beyond large Nf or in a fully nonperturbative calculation,\nthe true minimum of \u0393 may not be known (or at least relatable to the renormalized coupling) beforehand. Still, a suitable subtraction scale is required for the computation. An\nR\nalternative choice is, for instance, given by the average field \u03c3\u0304 2 = \u03a912 d2 x\u03c3(x)2 , where \u03a92\nis the 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime volume. With this choice, the large-Nf renormalized\neffective action becomes\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u0013 Z\u221e\n\u0012\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\nRT\ndT\nNf\n\u03c3\u0304\n2\n2\nhe\u2212 0 d\u03c4 \u03c3 \u03a6[\u03c3]ix \u2212 e\u2212\u03c3\u0304 T \uf8fb ,\n(2.20)\nd2 x \uf8f0\u03c3\u0304 2 ln 2 \u2212 1 +\n\u0393[\u03c3] =\n4\u03c0\nm\nT2\n0\n\nwhere m is still defined via Eq. (2.17). This choice of the subtraction scale has been used\nin [53]. Beyond large Nf or fully nonperturbatively, the first log term will be replaced by a\nmore complicated effective action, but the fermion loop contribution can still be computed\nin this manner and remains finite.\n\n3. Spatially inhomogeneous \u03c3 condensates\n3.1 Worldline formalism\nA number of nontrivial tests of the preceding general worldline approach can already be\nperformed within the Gross-Neveu model in D = 1 + 1 which we will exclusively consider\nin the following. For the case of static but spatially varying \u03c3 condensates, a number of\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fexact results can be derived, and these serve as stringent tests and controls of our general\nworldline approach. Special attention will be paid to bound states, especially zero modes\nand near-zero modes, as these pose the greatest numerical challenges.\nFor a static but spatially varying \u03c3(x), the renormalized action in the 1+1 dimensional\nGross-Neveu model at large Nf boils down to\n#\n\"\n\u0012D R\nZ T\nZ\nZ \u221e\nE\n\u0011 \u0013\n2 \u0010\nT\n2\n\u03c3\ndT\n2\nNf\nd\u03c4 \u03c3 \u2032 ) \u2212 2 e\u2212m T \u2212 1 \u22121 ,\ne\u2212 0 d\u03c4 \u03c3 cosh(\n\u0393[\u03c3] =\nd2 x \u2212\u03c3 2 +\n4\u03c0\nT2\nx m\n0\n0\n(3.1)\n\u2032\nwhere the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the spatial coordinate, \u03c3 = \u2202\u03c3/\u2202x.\nIt is convenient to combine exponential and hyperbolic function in the expectation value\nby defining\nV\u00b1 (x) := \u03c3 2 (x) \u00b1 \u03c3 \u2032 (x) ,\n(3.2)\nand\n\nNf\n\u0393=\n2\n\nwhere\n4\u03c0L\u00b1 := \u2212V\u00b1 +\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\ndT\nT2\n\nZ\n\n\u0012D\n\nd2 x (L+ + L\u2212 ) ,\n\u2212\n\ne\n\nR\n\nd\u03c4 V\u00b1\n\nE\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u0013\n\u0011\nV\u00b1 \u0010 \u2212m2 T\n\u2212 2 e\n\u22121 \u22121 .\nm\nx\n\n(3.4)\n\nSo far, we have not specified the details of the worldline ensemble.

We have normalized the heat kernel such that\nit agrees with the standard conventions of 1D quantum mechanical transition amplitudes.\nFor example, with a homogeneous condensate \u03c3(x) = m, we have V\u00b1 = m2 , and\n2\n\ne\u2212m T\nK\u00b1 (x; T ) = \u221a\n4\u03c0T\n\n.\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe transition amplitude, or heat kernel, in turn can be written as a sum over the eigen\nmodes \u03c8n of the Hamiltonian H\u00b1 :\nK\u00b1 (x; T ) \u2261 hx|e\u2212T H\u00b1 |xi =\n\nX\nn\n\nn\n\n|\u03c8n (x)|2 e\u2212T E\u00b1 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nn . This spectral decomposition\nwhere the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are denoted by E\u00b1\nfixes the large-T behavior of the worldline expectation value.

These inhomogeneous condensates are taken from known\ninhomogeneous solutions to the gap equation of the GN model [50, 28, 29]. This serves as a\nprecise test and control of our numerical scheme. These exact results are derived from the\ncorresponding exact resolvents, derived in Appendix B using the Gel'fand-Dik'ii equation\n(B.4, B.5), by an inverse Laplace transform:\nZ \u221e\n1\ndT e\u2212\u03bbT hx |e\u2212H\u00b1 T | xi .\n(3.9)\n|xi =\nR\u00b1 (x; \u2212\u03bb) \u2261 hx |\nH\u00b1 + \u03bb\n0\nFor example, with a homogeneous condensate \u03c3(x) = m, V\u00b1 = m2 , so the resolvent follows\ntrivially from (B.4). We find R\u00b1 (x; \u2212\u03bb) = 2\u221am12 +\u03bb , which leads to the familiar result (3.6)\nby an inverse Laplace transform.\n3.2 Single kink condensate\nConsider the inhomogeneous kink-like condensate, studied by inverse scattering in [50],\n\u03c3(x) = A tanh(A x).\n\n(3.10)\n\nThe associated effective Schr\u00f6dinger potentials (3.2) are\nV\u00b1 =\n\n(\nA2\n\nA2 (1 \u2212 2 sech2 (A x))\n\n.\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe kink condensate \u03c3(x), and the corresponding V\u00b1 (x), are plotted in Fig. 1. The potential V\u2212 (x) has an exact zero mode, localized on the kink.\nThe diagonal resolvents R\u00b1 (x; \u2212\u03bb) are derived in Appendix B, and an inverse Laplace\ntransform gives the corresponding exact heat kernels:\n\uf8f1\n2\n\uf8f2 e\u221a\u2212A T\n4\u03c0T\n\u0010 \u221a \u0011\n,\n(3.12)\nK\u00b1 (x; T ) =\n2\n\uf8f3 e\u221a\u2212A T + A Erf A T sech2 (A x)\n2\n4\u03c0T\n\nRz\n2\nwhere the error function is Erf(z) = \u221a2\u03c0 0 e\u2212t dt. According to Eqs. (3.7), (3.8), the\nzero mode of the V\u2212 potential is reflected in the large T behavior of K\u2212 (x; T ): K\u2212 (x; T \u2192\n\u221e) \u2192 A2 sech2 (Ax) \u2261 |\u03c80 (x)|2 .\nCapturing the zero-mode physics is indeed a precarious if not pathological problem for\nthe standard worldline algorithm discussed above. Close Rto the origin, the potential V\u2212 is\nT\nnegative, see Fig. 1, and consequently the exponent in e\u2212 0 d\u03c4 V\u2212 (x(\u03c4 )) is positive for certain\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f1.0\n\n0.5\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n4\n\nx\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n\nFigure 1: Plots of the kink condensate \u03c3(x) in Eq. (3.10) [solid, dark blue, line], and the potentials\nV\u00b1 (x) in Eq. (3.11). The potential V\u2212 [dashed, red, line] is localized on the kink, while V+ [dotted,\nlight blue, line] is constant. These plots are for A = 1.\n\nloops. Comparatively small loops with many points close to the origin can exponentially\ndominate the expectation value for large T , inducing an overlap problem for the Monte\nCarlo estimate. A similar overlap problem has been studied in [47].\n\u221a\nAccording to Eq. (3.8), the zero mode leads to a T increase of the exact worldline\nexpectation value. It is immediately clear that a finite and discrete loop ensemble cannot\ncapture this property for T \u2192 \u221e: since the distance between two neighboring points of a\n\u221a\ndiscretized loop scales with T , any loop ensemble will eventually no longer resolve the\nnegative peak of V\u2212 for large T , losing the information about the zero mode. Thus, for\nany finite, discrete loop ensemble generated with respect to the free worldline action, the\nexpectation value eventually decreases exponentially in the large T limit.\nRT\n\nIn Fig. 2, the analytic result for the expectation value he\u2212 0 d\u03c4 V\u2212 (x(\u03c4 )) i at the origin,\ni.e., the center of the kink, for A = 1 is compared to the worldline numerical result for two\nloop ensembles with different numbers of loops. For small propertimes, the results agree\nnicely. However, for large T values, the numerical results indeed decrease exponentially;\nthe values obtained using a smaller loop ensemble decrease more rapidly than the result\ncomputed with more loops. In this large T region, the statistical errors are much smaller\nthan the real error, which is typical for an overlap problem. Let us stress, however, that\nthe worldline estimate is still reliable for a much larger range of propertime than the\nfirst- or second-order heat-kernel expansion, which is an asymptotic small-T expansion [see\nAppendix B.5] that fails for propertimes larger than O(1). These heat-kernel expansion\napproximations are also plotted in Fig. 2, and we see clearly that the worldline result is\nfar superior at large propertime T .\nWe conclude that the zero-mode-induced overlap problem inhibits a straightforward\ncalculation of the heat kernel's large T behavior and can only be shifted to larger T values\nby using a larger loop ensemble. In Subsect. 3.6, we demonstrate that the overlap problem\ncan be solved by generating an adapted ensemble with a Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f1.2\nworldline 100 ppl\nexact: sech(x)^2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2|\u03c8|0 (x)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nx\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 2: Left panel: the CP-loop expectation value at the centre of a kink potential\u221awith A = 1\nversus the propertime T . For large propertimes, the analytic result is proportional to T . This is\nrediscovered by worldline numerics only up to a certain propertime value, depending on the number\nof loops employed. Still, the worldline estimate is reliable over a much larger range of propertimes\nthan the first- and second-order heat-kernel expansion. Right panel: zero-mode wave function of\nthe kink with A = 1 reconstructed from the worldline computation of the heat kernel at large T\nusing a CP loop ensemble.\n\nIn the present kink case, the zero-mode physics can still be identified with the standard\nfree ensemble, since it is clearly separated from the remaining spectrum. Already at finite\nbut large T , the heat kernel is essentially determined by the zero-mode contribution, with\nall other modes being exponentially suppressed. The right panel of figure 2 shows the zeromode shape extracted from the heat kernel at a range of propertime values T of O(10) using\n50000 CP loops consisting of 100 points per loop. In this propertime range, the modulus\nof the zero-mode wavefunction |\u03c80 |2 can be reconstructed from (3.7) by a fit. Comparison\nwith the exact result reveals that a rather rough discretisation of the loops already yields\nquite accurate results.\n3.3 Kink-antikink pair condensate\nThe single-kink condensate discussed in the previous subsection has an exact zero mode\nfor V\u2212 (x), which complicates the worldline numerics at large T . In this section, we probe\nthis phenomenon more precisely by considering a condensate for which the bound state is\nshifted away from zero energy. Consider the kink-antikink configuration:\n\u03c3(x) = A {coth(b) + [tanh(A x) \u2212 tanh(A x + b)]}\n\n= A {[coth(b) \u2212 tanh(b)] + tanh(b) tanh(A x) tanh(A x + b)} .\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhich has the form of a kink-antikink pair, with finite separation b/A.

Note that, in each case, the potential V\u2212 [dashed, red, line] is localized on the kink,\nwhile V+ [dotted, light blue, line] is localized on the anti-kink.\n\nThe kink-antikink condensate \u03c3(x), and the corresponding V\u00b1 (x), are plotted in Figure 3.\nThe potentials in Eq. (3.14) are special in the sense that they are reflectionless, and each\nhas a single bound state, located at A2 /sinh2 (b), and a continuum starting at A2 coth2 (b).\nNote that in the limit b \u2192 \u221e, the antikink disappears to minus infinity and we are left\nwith the single kink configuration \u03c3(x) = A tanh(A x), as in Eq. (3.10). To see this\npictorially, compare the second plot in Figure 3, in the vicinity of x = 0, with Figure\n1. Correspondingly, the bound state at A2 /sinh2 (b) becomes a zero mode in this infinite\nseparation limit.\nThe resolvents R\u00b1 (x; \u2212\u03bb) for the potentials V\u00b1 are derived in Appendix B, and the\nheat kernels follow from the inverse Laplace transform (3.9):\n(\n)\n2\n2\n\u0010 \u221a \u0011 sech2 (A x + b)\ne\u2212A coth (b) T\nA \u2212A2 T / sinh2 (b)\n\u221a\nErf A T\n.

In the limit b \u2192 0, A \u2192 0, with A coth b \u2261 m\nfixed, \u03c3(x) \u2192 m, and K\u00b1 (x; T ) reduce to the heat kernels (3.6) appropriate for a homogeneous condensate. For a comparison with worldline Monte Carlo results, we only consider\nthe challenging bound-state contribution contained, e.g., in K\u2212 (x; T ) [clearly K+ (x; T )\nyields the analogous result for L+ ]. This corresponds to the second term in Eq.

This choice minimizes the contribution of the continuum part of the\nspectrum to the action.

If A is larger than 1/ 2, the potential becomes negative at the origin. But\n\u221a\nonly for A = 1, there is a zero mode and the integrand in Eq. (3.18) is proportional to T\nin the limit T \u2192 \u221e.\nWe have performed a worldline numerical computation for five potentials with A values\n\u221a\nbetween 1/ 2 and 1, using the standard free ensemble in order to study the overlap problem\nquantitatively. The result corresponding to the propertime integral in Eq. (3.18) is shown\nin Figure 4. This analysis shows that, in general, the negative minimum of the potential\nis not a problem. Only for the largest A value, A = 0.995, for which Eb.s. = 0.00099975,\ndoes the algorithm have a severe convergence problem. In this case, the influence of the\nnear-zero mode becomes noticeable: the exponential factor in the integrand of Eq. (3.18)\ndecreases only weakly, and the integral is dominated by large propertime values, at which\nthe worldline numerical evaluation of the expectation value suffers from the overlap problem, similar to that displayed in Fig. 2. Whether or not a severe overlap problem occurs\n\u221a\ncan be estimated from the near-zero mode properties. A near-zero mode creates a T\nincrease of the worldline expectation value at intermediate T values, being followed by an\nexponential decrease at very large T values. The crossover occurs at T values T \u223c 1/E,\nwhere E corresponds to the near-zero mode's energy level. For instance, for the above\nkink-antikink case with A = 0.9995, the crossover occurs at T \u2243 (1 \u2212 A2 )\u22121 \u223c 103 , implying that a reliable estimate of the integrand up to values of T \u223c 103 would be needed in\norder to solve the overlap problem by brute force. For the case with A = 0.942809, the\ncrossover occurs already at T \u2243 (1 \u2212 A2 )\u22121 \u223c 9 which is well resolvable by the standard\nalgorithm with 1000 loops or more, cf. Fig. 2.\n3.4 Periodic array of kink-antikink pairs\nNext, consider a crystalline condensate formed from a periodic array of kink-antikink pairs:\n\u0012\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\ncn(b; \u03bd)dn(b; \u03bd)\n\u03c3(x) = A Z(b; \u03bd) +\n+ [Z(A x; \u03bd) \u2212 Z(A x + b; \u03bd)]\nsn(b; \u03bd)\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncn(b; \u03bd)dn(b; \u03bd)\n+ \u03bd sn(b; \u03bd) sn(A x; \u03bd) sn(A x + b; \u03bd)\n.\n(3.19)\n=A\nsn(b; \u03bd)\nHere Z(x; \u03bd) is the Jacobi zeta function, and sn, cn and dn the Jacobi elliptic functions,\nall with real elliptic parameter 0 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 1 [54, 55]. This type of inhomogeneous condensate\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 4: Convergence behaviour of the worldline-numerical result for near-zero mode contributions. The plot shows the numerical values corresponding to the propertime integral Eq. (3.18)\nversus the number of loops employed for different A values. The topmost values (green circles) are\nfor the same A value as the values immediately below (solid grey squares), but with the number of\nloops multiplied by a factor of 1000. The dotted horizontal lines represent the analytic values. The\nerror bars are the jackknife estimates and should provide reasonable values if the number of loops\nis larger than 1000. Evidently, this is not the case for the largest A value. This indicates an overlap\nproblem. At about 2 750 000 loops (n = 2750), we observe a huge jump of the result, apparently\ncaused by the occurrence of one single very small loop.\n\nis physically important in a number of contexts: it represents a bipolaron crystal in conducting polymers [56], and it characterizes a crystalline phase in the massive GN model\n[28]. In the limit \u03bd \u2192 1 we recover the kink-antikink configuration (3.13), since in this\nlimit: sn(b; \u03bd) \u2192 tanh(b), Z(b; \u03bd) \u2192 tanh(b), cn(b; \u03bd) \u2192 sech(b), and dn(b; \u03bd) \u2192 sech(b).\nNote that we can restrict to 0 \u2264 b \u2264 K(\u03bd), because of the periodicity of the Jacobi elliptic\nfunctions. When b = K(\u03bd), this condensate is important for soliton lattices in polymers\n[56, 57], for the Peierls model [58], for periodic phases in superconductors [59], and for the\ncrystal phase of the massless GN model [28]. In this case, discussed in more detail in the\nnext subsection, the neighbouring antikinks lie at the very edge of the period, and so in\nthe infinite period limit [\u03bd \u2192 1], the antikinks disappear to plus/minus infinity, and we are\nleft with the single-kink configuration (3.10). Thus, the configuration (3.19) contains all\nthe other examples as special cases in a particular parametric limit.\nThe potentials (3.2) corresponding to the periodic condensate (3.19) are\n2\n\nV\u00b1 = A\n\n1\n\u2212 1 + \u03bd \u2212 2\u03bd\nsn2 (b; \u03bd)\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n(\n)!\ncn2 (A x + b; \u03bd)\ncn2 (A x; \u03bd)\n\n.\n\n(3.20)\n\n\f-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx\n\nFigure 5: Plots of the periodic condensate \u03c3(x) in Eq. (3.19) and of the periodic potentials V\u00b1 (x)\nin Eq. (3.20). The first plot is for elliptic parameter \u03bd = 0.5, for which K(0.5) = 1.85, while the\nsecond plot is for \u03bd = 0.999, for which K(0.999) = 4.84. In each plot, A = 1 and b = 0.5. The solid\n[dark blue] curves are the periodic condensates. Note that V\u2212 (x) [dashed, red, lines] are localized\non the kink, while V+ (x) [dotted, light blue, lines] are localized on the antikink. Notice that as\n\u03bd \u2192 1, the period diverges, and we recover the kink-antikink configuration: compare the second\nplot with the first plot in Figure 3.\n\nThe kink-antikink crystal condensate \u03c3(x), and the corresponding V\u00b1 (x), are plotted in\nFigure 5.\nThese potentials are periodic functions, with period 2 K(\u03bd)/A, and are special in the\nsense that they possess only a single bound band \u2013 they are the simplest example of the\n\"finite-gap\" potentials [60], which are the periodic analogue of reflectionless potentials.\nV\u00b1 (x) are the same function, displaced in x, and so they have precisely the same band\nspectrum. In the language of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, they are self-isospectral\n[61]. The band spectrum is plotted in Figure 6. The band edges lie at A2 cs2 (b; \u03bd) and\nA2 ds2 (b; \u03bd), and with a continuum starting at A2 ns2 (b; \u03bd). As \u03bd \u2192 1, the period diverges,\nand the bound band shrinks to a single bound state at A2 /sinh2 (b), which is just the bound\nstate of the reflectionless system associated with the single kink-antikink pair.\nThe resolvents for the potentials in (3.20) are derived in Appendix B, and the corresponding propagators are obtained by an inverse Laplace transform:\n(\n)\ncn2 (A x + b; \u03bd)\nK\u00b1 (x; T ) = \u03b1(T ) + \u03b2(T )\n.\n(3.21)\ncn2 (A x; \u03bd)\nNote that the coefficients \u03b1(T ) and \u03b2(T ) are the same for the two propagators \u2013 the only\ndifference between K+ and K\u2212 is the shift of the x dependence in the cn2 functions.

The spectrum has a single bound band,\nwith band edges A2 cs2 (b; \u03bd) and A2 ds2 (b; \u03bd), and a continuum band starting at A2 ns2 (b; \u03bd). When\n\u03bd \u2192 1, the bound band contracts to a single bound level at A2 / sinh2 b, with the continuum edge\nat A2 coth2 b. In the other limit, as \u03bd \u2192 0, the spectrum is pure continuum, with lower edge at\nA2 cot2 b. This plot is for b = 1. These features can be clearly seen in the associated resolvents in\nthe text.\n\nWhen \u03bd = 1 we recover the propagators for the kink-antikink pair configuration in (3.15),\nwhile when \u03bd = 0 we find propagators for a homogeneous condensate of mass A cot(b).\nAn interesting special value of \u03bd is the lemniscate case, \u03bd = 12 , for which \u03b2(T ) takes\nthe simple Bessel function form\n1\n1\n2 2\n\u03b2(T ) = e\u2212A ds (b; 2 ) T\n4\n\nr\n\n\u03c0A2 T\nI1\n4\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nA2 T\n4\n\n\u0013\n\nI\u2212 1\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\nA2 T\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.24)\n\nFor a comparison with worldline numerics, we choose typical potential parameters as they\noccur in the phase diagram of the GN model at finite densities and temperature: b = 1,\n\u03bd = 0.9, and A = m/ coth(1). Since this typical form of the potential is free of (near)zero modes, it represents a direct test of the quantitative reliability of worldline Monte\nCarlo for fermionic fluctuations in generic backgrounds. Figure 7 shows the expectation\nR\nvalue hexp(\u2212 V\u2212 )i versus the propertime in a minimum of the potential V\u2212 . Due to the\nabsence of a zero mode, the values decrease exponentially already for small propertimes,\nin contrast to the corresponding single kink result in Figure 2, and we see in Figure 7\nthat the numerical and analytic results agree very well. Even a small loop ensemble, of\njust 2000 loops, yields tiny errors. By contrast, the first- and second-order heat-kernel\nexpansion, which is a standard analytic expansion technique, fails badly for T & 1. For\nfurther quantitative comparison, we integrate the resulting Lagrangian L\u2212 over one period\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 7: The worldline expectation-value versus the propertime in a minimum of the potential\nV\u2212 for b = 1, \u03bd = 0.9, and A = m/ coth(1). The statistical error is too tiny to be plotted. Due\nto the absence of a zero mode, the values decrease exponentially very early, in contrast to the\ncorresponding values for a single kink, as shown in Fig. 2.

Note that the bottom of the lowest band is at 0, for all \u03bd, and that there\nis just one bound band. The corresponding heat kernels K\u00b1 (x; T ) can be obtained from\nthose in the previous section by the simple substitution b \u2192 K(\u03bd).\n3.6 Worldline ensembles from Hybrid Monte Carlo\nSince the standard worldline ensembles generated with respect to the free worldline action\ncan lead to an overlap problem for the special case of a (near-)zero mode in the fermion\nspectrum, let us explore a different route: we generate the ensemble with respect to the full\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fE2\nA2\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n\u039d\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFigure 9: The spectrum of the Schr\u00f6dinger operators H\u00b1 with \u03c3(x) given by the periodic condensate Eq.

When \u03bd \u2192 1, the bound\nband contracts to a single bound level at 0. In the other limit, as \u03bd \u2192 0, the spectrum is pure\ncontinuum, with lower edge at 0.\n\naction using a Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. In principle, worldline generation\nwith the full action would also be possible with a local update algorithm such as the\nMetropolis update. However, due to the fact that the worldlines are one-dimensional, local\nupdates suffer from a long auto-correlation time, as observed in [43]. This is avoided by\nthe global HMC update.\nThe quantity which will be central for the HMC simulation is given by\n2\n\nhx|(\u2212\u220212 + V\u00b1 )e\u2212T (\u2212\u22021 +V\u00b1 ) |xi\nd\n,\nln K\u00b1 (x, T ) =\nW (x, T ) = \u2212\n2\ndT\nhx|e\u2212T (\u2212\u22021 +V\u00b1 ) |xi\n2\n\nK\u00b1 (x, T ) = hx|e\u2212T (\u2212\u22021 +V\u00b1 ) |xi .\n\n(3.31)\n(3.32)\n\nThis quantity is given by means of an expectation value with respect to the full loop\nensemble:\nE\nD\nW (x, T ) = \u2212\u220212 + V\u00b1\n,\n(3.33)\nxF\n\nwhere the loops are generated with the probability\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ T\nZ T\ni\nh 1Z T\n2\nd\u03c4 V\u00b1 (x(\u03c4 )) .\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b (\u03c4 ) \u2212\nd\u03c4 x(\u03c4 ) exp \u2212\nPF [x] = \u03b4 xCM \u2212\n4 0\n0\n0\n\n(3.34)\n\nThe strategy is to generate statistically important loop configurations {x(\u03c4 )} using HMC\nmethods and to estimate W (T, x) in (3.33). The advantage of this approach is that the\nloop ensemble already incorporates features of the potentials V\u00b1 , and that far fewer configurations are required for a reliable estimate of expectation values than for free loop clouds.\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fThe disadvantage is that more computational resources are necessary to generate the HMC\nloop ensembles. Ultimately, it will depend on the particular potential whether the additional numerical effort is justified. We will argue that this is the case for a Hamiltonian\nH\u00b1 = (\u2212\u220212 + V\u00b1 ) which possesses zero modes.\nOnce a numerical estimate for W (x, T ) is obtained, the heat kernel K\u00b1 can be reconstructed by integration of (3.31) with respect to the propertime. Note that the kernel\nsatisfies the boundary condition K\u00b1 (x, 0) = 1. We therefore find:\n\u001b\n\u001a Z T\nd\u03c4 W (x, \u03c4 ) .\n(3.35)\nK\u00b1 (x, T ) = exp \u2212\n0\n\nLet us briefly comment on the implementation of the discretized loops. As before, the\npropertime interval \u03c4 = [0, T ] is represented using N points:\n\u03c4 = n d\u03c4 ,\n\nd\u03c4 =\n\nT\n,\nN\n\nn = 1...N ,\n\nN odd .\n\n(3.36)\n\nFor a simplification of the notation, we will assume that N is odd. We base the HMC\nalgorithm on a discrete Fourier representation of the worldlines, which can easily account\nfor the worldline periodicity and leads to uncoupled degrees of freedom for V\u00b1 = 0. Hence,\nconsidering the Fourier coefficients as degrees of freedom implies that loop ensembles can\nbe generated with little autocorrelation as long as the influence of the potential is not too\nsignificant.2 For CM loops, we have the representation:\n\u221a\n\nT\nx(\u03c4 ) = xCM +\nN\n\nN\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\n2\nX\n\nk=\u2212\n\n2\u03c0\nck exp i\nk\u03c4\nT\nN\u22121\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nc\u2212k = c\u2217k ,\n\n,\n\nc0 = 0.\n\n(3.37)\n\nIn the case of CP loops, for which xCP is the common point, we analogously find\nx(\u03c4 ) = xCP\n\n\u221a\n\nT\n+\nN\n\nN\u22121\n2\n\nX\n\nck\n\nk=\u2212 N\u22121\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nexp i\nk\u03c4\nT\n\n\u0013\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(3.38)\n\nWith these representations, the worldline kinetic term is Gaussian in the weights ck :\n1\n4\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b2 (\u03c4 ) \u2192\n\nN\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\nX\n1 X (x(\u03c4 + d\u03c4 ) \u2212 x(\u03c4 ))2\n=\nck c\u2212k sin2\nk .\n4\nd\u03c4\nN\nn=1\n\nk\n\nThe task is now to generate statistical ensembles of the degrees of freedom\nck ,\n\nk = \u2212\n\nN \u22121\nN \u22121\n, . . . , \u22121, 1, . . .\n,\n2\n2\n\nwhich are distributed according to, e.g., the CM probability distribution (3.34). Note that\nthe \u03b4-function constraint has been exactly incorporated leaving us with 2 N 2\u22121 = N \u2212 1\n2\n\nAn HMC algorithm could equally be based on the v loop algorithm [43], since it features the same\nnecessary properties. By contrast, an HMC generalization of the d loop algorithm [51] which is based on\nan iterative loop construction seems not to be straightforward.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fdegrees of freedom, parameterized by the coefficients ck . For the HMC approach, it is highly\nadvisable to introduce real valued degrees of freedom. We therefore define the coefficients\ndk \u2208 R by\ndk = ck + c\u2212k ,\n\nd\u2212k = i (ck \u2212 c\u2212k ) ,\n\nk = 1...\n\nN \u22121\n.\n2\n\n(3.39)\n\nWith this definition the loop coordinates, for instance, for the CM loops (3.37) are manifestly real valued:\nx(\u03c4 ) = xCM\n\n\u221a\n\nN\u22121\n\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n2\nT X\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n+\ndk cos\nk \u03c4 + d\u2212k sin\nk\u03c4\n.\nN\nT\nT\n\n(3.40)\n\nk=1\n\nThe next step is to introduce the canonical momentum \u03c0k \u2208 R for each degree of freedom\ndk . The corresponding HMC Hamiltonian is defined by\n\u0003\n1 X\u0002 2\n\u03c0k + V(dk ) ,\n2\nk\nZ T\nZ\n1 T\n2\nV(dk ) =\nd\u03c4 V\u00b1 (x(\u03c4 )) .\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b (\u03c4 ) +\n4 0\n0\n\nH(\u03c0k , dk ) =\n\n(3.41)\n(3.42)\n\nThe degrees of freedom experience an evolution with the so-called HMC time u. This time\nevolution is determined by the Hamilton equations of motion:\nd\ndk = \u03c0k ,\ndu\n\nd\n\u2202V(dk )\n\u03c0k = \u2212\n.\ndu\n\u2202dk\n\n(3.43)\n\nThe important property of any solution dk (u), \u03c0k (u) is that the HMC energy is conserved:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\nH \u03c0k (u), dk (u) = 0 .\ndu\n\nThe initial momenta \u03c0k (u = 0) are selected at random from a Gaussian distribution. The\ninitial coordinates ck (u = 0) are given by their actual ensemble values. With these initial\nconditions, the values at u = uf are approximately obtained with the help of a Leapfrog\nintegration of the equations of motion (3.43). Because the equations of motion are not\nsolved exactly, the HMC energy H is not exactly conserved. The idea central to the HMC\napproach is to accept the values dk (uf ) as new members of the Markov chain with the\nprobability\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\ni\nh\ni\np = min 1, exp{\u2212 \u2206H} ,\n\u2206H = H \u03c0k (uf ), dk (uf ) \u2212 H \u03c0k (0), dk (0) . (3.44)\n\nSince the equations of motion are satisfied to a good extent due to the Leapfrog integration,\nthe value ck (uf ) can be largely different from ck (0) (implying good ergodicity) while the\nacceptance rate is still high.\nIn order to test the HMC approach, we revisit the kink background field (3.10) (with\nA = 1 in the following). The HMC final time is given by uf = Ntra du where Ntra is\nthe number of steps of the Leapfrog integration. The step size du is chosen to obtain an\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fNp=41, Ntra=10, V(x)\n\nxCM=0\n\n2\n\n0\nT=1\nT=10\nT=40\n\n-0.2\n\n1.6\n\nW(T, xCM)\n\nH(Ntra=10) / H(0)\n\n1.8\n\n1.4\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n1.2\n\n101 ppl, Ntra=15\n41 ppl, Ntra=10\n\n-0.8\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n-1\n0\n\n5\n\ndu\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nT\n\nFigure 10: Left panel: the HMC energy as a function of step size du of the Leapfrog integration.\nRight panel: the function W (x = 0, T ) for the kink configuration obtained with HMC loops. The\nlarge-T behavior is dominated by the ground-state energy, cf. Eq. (3.45). Sufficiently many points\nper loop N are required in order to observe the approach to the zero-energy mode of the kink.\n\nacceptance rate between 20% and 80%. Figure 10 (left panel) shows the HMC energy as\nfunction of the step size du for several values for the proper time. We find that a value\ndu \u2248 0.3 provides a good compromise between ergodicity and acceptance rate. Using the\nHMC ensembles for CM loops, the function W (x, T ) is estimated and the heat kernel is\nreconstructed with the help of the proper time integration (see Eq. (3.35)). Note that\nbecause of (3.31), we find for large values of T\nW (x, T ) \u2248 E0 + (E1 \u2212 E0 )\n\n|hx|1i|2 \u2212(E1 \u2212E0 ) T\ne\n|hx|0i|2\n\n(T large),\n\n(3.45)\n\nwhere E0 , E1 are the energies of ground and first excited states, and |0i and |1i are the\ncorresponding wave functions. In theories with a gap between the first excited and the\nground state, the latter equation implies that W (x, T ) rapidly approaches a constant, i.e.,\nthe ground state energy E0 , for large T . In the worst case scenario of a zero mode, W (x, T )\napproaches zero and a positive constant otherwise. Figure 10 (right panel) shows the result for W (x = 0, T ) for the kink configuration. Indeed, the function W (x, T ) rapidly\napproaches a constant for large T . The overlap problem, discussed in the previous subsections, has been solved by the use of HMC loop ensembles. Note, however, that, also in the\npresent case, the number of points per loop N must be large enough: for coarse loops, the\nnumerical estimate approaches a negative constant thus erroneously suggesting a negative\nground state energy and an instability of the operator. A sufficiently fine representation\nor an improved integration over loop coordinates might resolve this problem.\nFinally, we present our final result for the reconstructed heat kernel in Fig. 11. We\nobtain very good results with HMC using only a modest number of points per loop.\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\f40\nfree 100 ppl\nfree 10000 ppl\nHMC 100 ppl\n\nkink heat kernel\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\npropertime T\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 11: HMC results for the heat kernel for the kink configuration in comparison with the\nresult obtained from free loop ensembles (all used ensembles are CM loops). Significantly fewer\nHMC loops are required for a reliable estimate of the large-propertime behavior.\n\nTo conclude this subsection, the overlap problem of the free loop cloud method is\nindeed solved by adopting the HMC approach. Note, however, that a precise estimate of\nthe effective action in the case of a (near-)zero mode is still a numerical challenge.\n\n4. Worldline approach at finite temperature and chemical potential\nEven though introducing finite temperature and chemical potential appears straightforward\nin the worldline approach, special attention has to be paid to combining this straightforward\nformalism with Monte Carlo algorithms. The reason is that an analysis of field theories at\nfinite temperatures and densities often requires knowledge about the analytic structure of\npropagators etc. in the complex energy-momentum plane, or similar conjugate variables\nsuch as the propertime. By contrast, Monte Carlo algorithms require a positive real action\nfor importance sampling, and this restricts the computable information to lie on the real\naxis of given variables.\nSince this conflict of interests between thermal field theory at finite density and Monte\nCarlo algorithms is general and not only restricted to the Gross-Neveu model, we discuss\nthis problem in more detail in the following.\n4.1 Temperature in the worldline representation\nConsider the worldline formulation of a general quantum-field theoretic amplitude. Finite\ntemperature can easily be implemented with the aid of the Matsubara formalism: The\nEuclidean time, say along the Dth direction, is compactified to the interval [0, \u03b2] with\nperiodic boundary conditions for worldline fluctuations for bosonic fields and antiperiodic\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fboundary conditions for fermionic degrees of freedom. Here \u03b2 = 1/T is the inverse temperature. (Note that we reserve the symbol T for propertime, whereas the temperature is\ndenoted by T .) As a consequence, the worldlines can also wind around the time dimension.\nIt is convenient to write a given loop x(\u03c4 ) with winding number n as sum of a loop with\nno winding, x\u0303(\u03c4 ), and a translation in time running from zero to n\u03b2 with constant speed,\n\u03c4\nx\u03bc (\u03c4 ) = x\u0303\u03bc (\u03c4 ) + n\u03b2 \u03b4\u03bcD .\nT\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe path integral over the different winding number sectors labeled by n factorizes for\nstatic configurations, yielding\nZ\n\nx(0)=x(T )\n\n\u2212\n\nDx e\n\nRT\n0\n\n2\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b4\n\n*** =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2 2\n\nn \u2212 n4T\u03b2\n\n(\u22121) e\n\nZ\n\nx\u0303(0)=x\u0303(T )\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nDx\u0303 e\u2212\n\nRT\n0\n\n \u03072\n\nd\u03c4 x\u03034\n\n*** .\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere the factor (\u22121)n implements antiperiodic boundary conditions for the present fermion fluctuations; it would be absent for bosons here and in the following. A finite-temperature generalization of a vacuum propertime expression is straightforwardly obtained from\na simple insertion into the propertime integral,\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\ndT * * * \u2192\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndT\n\n\u221e\nX\nn2 \u03b2 2\n(\u22121)n e\u2212 4T\n\u2212\u221e\n\n!\n\n...\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere the ellipsis represent, for instance, a heat-kernel expression or a worldline expectation\nvalue etc. The winding number sum over n is directly related to the Matsubara sum by a\nPoisson transformation. Quantum and thermal fluctuations are separated by the different\nwinding number sectors: the n = 0 term is identical to the vacuum expression, while the\n|n| \u2265 1 sectors are purely thermal contributions which vanish in the vacuum limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\nLet us stress that the present thermal formalism not only holds in general but is also\ncompletely robust when combined with worldline Monte Carlo techniques, as has been\nused in the context of the Casimir effect at finite temperature [62].. The winding number sum converges rapidly in the relevant low- and intermediate temperature range; at\nhigh temperatures where increasingly more winding sectors would have to be resummed, a\nPoisson resummation to Matsubara sums can be performed, such that rapid convergence\nis guaranteed for all temperatures. In particular, analytical or numerical knowledge of\nthe heat kernel on the real T axis is sufficient for a reliable estimate of thermodynamic\namplitudes. For example, it is straightforward to derive the critical temperature for symmetry restoration in the Gross-Neveu model within the present formalism, yielding the\nwell-known result\n\u03b2c = \u03c0e\u2212C m\u22121 \u2248 1.76387m\u22121 ,\n\nTc = 1/\u03b2c \u2248 0.566932m\n\n(4.4)\n\nin units of m [63]. For temperatures larger than the critical temperature Tc , the potential\n\u03c3 vanishes and the spontaneously broken discrete chiral symmetry is restored.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\f4.2 Chemical potential in the worldline representation\nIntroducing a finite chemical potential via the grand-canonical partition function leads us\nto the microscopic action of the Gross-Neveu model at finite density,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ng2\nD\n2\nS = d x \u2212\u03c8\u0304 (\u2202/ + \u03bc\u03b3D ) \u03c8 +\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03c8) ,\n(4.5)\n2Nf\nin D dimensions. The resulting contribution to the effective action from fermionic fluctuations reads analogously to Eq. (2.5)\n\u2206\u0393[\u03c3] = \u2212\n\nNf\nTr ln(\u2212\u2202~2 \u2212 (\u2202D + \u03bc)2 + \u03c3 2 \u2212 i\u2202/\u03c3).\n2\n\n(4.6)\n\nSince the chemical potential occurs in the form of the Dth component of an imaginary\nEuclidean gauge potential in the effective action, it is tempting to jump directly to the\ncorresponding worldline representation in the presence of gauge fields, which are coupled\nto the worldline in the form of a Wegner-Wilson loop. In other words, the free worldline\naction receives a further contribution of the form\n1\n\ne\u2212 4\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b2\n\n1\n\n\u2192 e\u2212 4\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8b2 \u2212\u03bc\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u1e8bD\n\n\u2192 (\u22121)n e\u2212\n\nn2 \u03b2 2\n4T\n\n1\n\ne\u2212 4\n\nRT\n0\n\nd\u03c4 ~\nx \u0307 2 \u2212\u03bc\u03b2n\n\n,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere in the last step we have used the decomposition of worldlines into different winding\nnumber sectors n on the finite-temperature cylinder. Since also negative winding numbers\nare allowed, it is already apparent that the winding number sum may suffer from convergence problems at large \u03b2\u03bc. This issue will be discussed in detail in the next subsection;\nlet us simply state here that convergence problems are absent for \u03b2\u03bc < \u03c0 which we will\nassume in the following.\nDecomposing the winding number sum into the vacuum sector n = 0, and the temperature and density corrections |n| \u2265 1, implying a decomposition of the effective action (or\ngrand potential) into a vacuum part \u0393, and a thermal part \u2206\u0393\u03b2,\u03bc :\n\u0393\u03b2,\u03bc = \u0393 + \u2206\u0393\u03b2,\u03bc ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwith \u0393 given by Eq. (2.18), we end up with the worldline representation for the thermal\ncontribution at finite density\n\u2206\u0393\u03b2,\u03bc =\n\nZ\n\nNf d\u03b3\nd x\n(4\u03c0)D/2\nD\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndT\nT 1+D/2\n\n\u0012X\n\u221e\n\n2 2\n\nn \u2212 \u03b24Tn\n\n(\u22121) e\n\nn=1\n\n\u0013D R\nE\nT\n2\ncosh(\u03bc\u03b2n) e\u2212 0 d\u03c4 \u03c3 \u03a6[\u03c3] .\n\n(4.9)\nFor \u03b2\u03bc < \u03c0, this representation is reasonably converging and can numerically be implemented rather straightforwardly. Naively interchanging summation and integration yields\nrapidly converging propertime integrals for any given n; however, the n sum, which is\nreminiscent of a fugacity expansion, then diverges for \u03b2\u03bc > \u03c0. Of course, Eq. (4.9) can\nimmediately be used for a finite-density expansion in \u03b2\u03bc to any order. It is also straightforwardly applicable to the case of imaginary chemical potential where all convergence issues\nare absent.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 12: Phase diagram for a constant potential (cf. [63]) computed by numerically minimising\nthe full action with respect to \u03c3. The colour corresponds to the resulting \u03c3 value, the phase of\nrestored chiral symmetry is in black. The tricritical point is marked by a white circle, located\nbetween phase transitions of second order (the upper boundary of the blue region) and transitions\nof first order (discrete jump of the colour/\u03c3 value). The line of second order transitions extends to\nthe \u03bc = 0 axis, where it is marked by an arrow at the value Tc \u2248 0.567 Eq. (4.4). The blank region\nbelow the T = \u03bc/\u03c0 line is inaccessible to the given expression for the action as discussed in the\ntext.\n\nAs an application of Eq. (4.9), let us briefly revisit the phase diagram for a homogeneous\nR\n\u03c3 condensate. The worldline expectation value for this is trivial, since exp(\u2212 V\u00b1 ) =\nexp(\u2212T \u03c3 2 ), for any single worldline. This case serves as a simple but instructive test\nfor the (non-worldline) numerics of our algorithms, and for the representation Eq. (4.9).\nIn Fig. 12, the phase diagram obtained by numerically minimising the full action with\nrespect to \u03c3 for a given chemical potential and temperature is shown. In the accessible\ndomain, that is for \u03b2\u03bc < \u03c0, the diagram agrees with the result of [63], as it should. At\n\u03bc = 0, we recover the critical temperature in Eq. (4.4). Even close to the line \u03b2\u03bc = \u03c0, i.e.\ntemperature T = \u03bc/\u03c0, below which the propertime integral has convergence problems, we\nobtain a stable result.\n4.3 High densities and low temperatures\nLet us further investigate the instability for \u03b2\u03bc > \u03c0. For this purpose, we first address the\nhomogeneous background \u03c3=constant, \u03a6[\u03c3] = 1, and extend the findings to the general\ncase at the end of this subsection.\nThe (regularized) effective action is given by\n\u0012 X\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nZ\n\u221e\n2 2\nNf d\u03b3\ndT\n2\n1\nn \u2212 \u03b24Tn \u2212\u03bc\u03b2n\nD\n(\u22121) e\ne\ne\u2212T \u03c3 .\n(4.10)\nd x\n\u0393\u03b2,\u03bc =\nD/2\n1+D/2\n2\n(4\u03c0)\n1/\u039b2 T\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fIn order to perform the sum over the windings n, we introduce a Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation by\ns\nZ\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u03b2 2 n2\n4\u03c0T\nn \u2212 4T \u2212\u03bc\u03b2n\ni2\u03c0n \u03bd \u2212T [ \u03b2 (\u03bd+ 2 )\u2212i\u03bc]2\n.\n(4.11)\n(\u22121) e\nd\u03bd\ne\ne\ne\n=\n\u03b22\nInserting (4.11) in (4.10) yields for the T integral\ns\nZ \u221e\nZ\n\u221e Z\n1\n2\u03c0\nN\nd\n1\ndT\n4\u03c0T X\n\u03b3\nf\ni2\u03c0n \u03bd \u2212T [ \u03b2 (\u03bd+ 2 )\u2212i\u03bc]2 \u2212T \u03c32\nD\n\u0393\u03b2,\u03bc =\ne\n.\nd\u03bd\ne\ne\nd x\n2\n\u03b2 2 n=\u2212\u221e\n(4\u03c0)D/2 1/\u039b2 T 1+D/2\n(4.12)\nThe IR problem for large values T has become apparent: the T integration converges\nprovided\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132\n\u03c0\nRe\n(4.13)\n\u2212 i\u03bc + \u03c3 2 > 0.\n\u03b2\nFor imaginary chemical potential this condition is always satisfied.

This point and therewith some part of the crystalline phase is above the line defined by\n\u03b2\u03bc = \u03c0, where \u03b2\u03bc > \u03c0. Consequently, already the straight forward evaluation of Eq. (4.9)\nallows for studying translational-symmetry breaking.\nWe consider several points on a line slightly above the \u03b2\u03bc = \u03c0 line, given by 1.1\u03b2\u03bc = \u03c0,\nwhich intersects the crystalline phase between \u03bc = 0.63m and \u03bc = 0.67m. For each point,\nwe determine the potential \u03c3 of the ground state analytically as described in [30]. Using\nthis potential, we evaluate Eq. (2.18) and Eq. (4.9) with worldline numerics and compare\nthe resulting value of the grand potential per volume with the corresponding value for the\nconstant field solution.\nFigure (13) shows the difference of these two values as well as the analytic result according to [30].

The line T = 1.1\u03bc/\u03c0 crosses the crystal phase between \u03bc = 0.63m\nand 0.67m, approximately. Consequently, we obtain negative values in this range. The numerical\nvalues agree with the analytic result and are significantly below zero.\n\nconfirms the thermodynamic preference of the crystal solution over the homogeneous potential in the range 0.63m < \u03bc < 0.67m which is reflected in negative values of the plotted\ndifference.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have demonstrated that the Monte Carlo approach to the worldline formulation of quantum field theory may be consistently implemented to study interacting fermionic models\nsuch as the Gross-Neveu model. We have explained the required formalism and tested\nnumerically the worldline results in comparison to a number of analytic results for inhomogeneous condensates, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of the numerical\napproach. In particular, in Section 4.4 we have used this approach to confirm the existence\nof the inhomogeneous crystalline phase of the Gross-Neveu model. While this is a highly\nnon-trivial test, the true potential of the worldline Monte Carlo approach lies in the possibility of scaling up to higher dimensions without dramatic numerical problems, and the\npossibility of realizing chiral symmetries directly. These issues are under investigation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nKL thanks Simon Hands for helpful discussions on dense fermionic systems.

Fermionic models and continuous chiral symmetry\nIn this work, we have mainly focussed on the the D = 1 + 1 dimensional Gross-Neveu (GN)\nmodel defined by the Euclidean fermionic action in (2.1). The GN model has a discrete\nchiral symmetry under \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b35 \u03c8, rather than a continuous chiral symmetry. In order to\ndiscuss the fate of chiral symmetry in our numerical worldline approach, it is instructive\nto study the Thirring model, defined by the action\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ng2\nD\n2\nSF = d x \u2212\u03c8\u0304\u2202/\u03c8 +\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8) ,\n(A.1)\n2Nf\nIn addition to global phase and axial rotations, the Thirring model is invariant under\nSU(Nf )R \u00d7 SU(Nf )L chiral transformations.

In the large-Nf limit, the effective\naction upon integrating out the fermion fluctuations yields\nZ\nNf\n\u0393[V\u03bc ] = dD x 2 V\u03bc2 \u2212 Nf Tr ln(\u2212\u2202/ \u2212 iV/ ), Nf \u2192 \u221e.\n(A.3)\n2g\nAs in the Gross-Neveu case, the resulting Dirac operator D = i\u2202/ \u2212 V/ has a \u03b35 hermiticity,\nD \u2020 = \u03b35 D\u03b35 , implying that \u0393 can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\nNf\nD Nf\n2\n2\n\u0393[V\u03bc ] = d x 2 V\u03bc \u2212\nTr ln \u2212D[V ] + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd V\u03bc\u03bd , Nf \u2192 \u221e,\n(A.4)\n2g\n2\n2\nwhere D[V ] = \u2202\u03bc + iV\u03bc , \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = 2i [\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd ], and the vector field strength V\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc V\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd V\u03bc .\nBy virtue of the D = 1 + 1 dimensional Dirac algebra, the spin-field coupling (Pauli term)\ncan also be expressed as \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd V\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b35 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd V\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03b35 Ve . Here, we prefer to work with the\nrepresentation given in Eq. (A.4) which generalizes straightforwardly to higher dimensions3 .\nNote that the fermionic contribution exhibits an accidental local gauge symmetry, which\nis, however, not respected by the classical action \u223c V\u03bc2 .\nIncidentally, the 4-fermion vector interaction of the Thirring model is the only SU(Nf )R\n\u00d7 SU(Nf )L chirally invariant and parity-even interaction which contributes to leading-order\n3\n\nOdd dimensions require reducible representations of the Dirac algebra in order to maintain \u03b35 hermiticity of the Dirac operator.\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\fat large-Nf in D = 2.
