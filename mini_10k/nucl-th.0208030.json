The essential idea behind this reasoning is that\nfor quasifree kinematics the dominant production process is given by the elementary reaction on one nucleon while\nthe other acts merely as a spectator. However, this is possible only if competing two-body processes like final state\ninteraction (FSI) in the \u03c0N N system and possible two-body exchange current contributions are under control.\nEarly studies of this reaction are done in [1, 2, 3]. Approximate treatments of final state interaction effects within a\ndiagrammatic approach have been reported in [4, 5]. In that work, a comparison with experimental data was possible\nonly for \u03c0 \u2212 production [6], and a satisfactory agreement was found. The authors noted that the FSI effects are quite\nsmall for the charged pion photoproduction reactions in comparison to the neutral channel. More recently Levchuk\net al. [7] studied quasifree \u03c0 0 photoproduction on the neutron via the d(\u03b3, \u03c0 0 )np reaction using the elementary\nphotoproduction operator of Blomqvist and Laget [3]. In agreement with the results of [5], they found that the largest\nrescattering effects arise from the np final state interaction leading to a strong reduction of the cross section at pion\nforward angles, but are much less important in backward direction. The experimental data from [8] for the d(\u03b3, \u03c0 0 )np\nreaction qualitatively support this prediction although a direct comparison was not possible. The threshold region\nwas explored in [9] where a sizeable effect from \u03c0N rescattering was noted via intermediate charged pion production\nwith subsequent charge exchange. Recently, Levchuk et al. [10] modified the theoretical predictions of [7] using a more\nrealistic elementary production operator and including also the charged pion production channels but considering only\nN N rescattering for which the Bonn r-space potential [11] was used. The elementary production operator was taken\nfrom the SAID [12] and MAID [13] multipole analyses. The sizeable effects from N N FSI were confirmed and good\nagreement with the experimental data was achieved.\nThe present paper is a natural extension of our work in [14] where this process was studied in the pure impulse\napproximation (IA), i.e., without inclusion of any FSI or two-body currents. First of all, we were interested in the\nquestion whether inclusion of FSI would lead to a good description of the available data, in particular with respect\nto the recent data on incoherent \u03c0 0 production on the deuteron [8]. Although quite a good description was already\nachieved in [10], we were puzzeled by the fact that the results for the IA of this work showed certain significant\ndifferences to our IA results [14] for charged pion production, which is most obvious in the differential cross sections\nat forward angles. The origin of this discrepancy was not clear. Furthermore, it was an open question whether the\ninclusion of rescattering contributions would lead to a different result. Therefore, we have included in the present work\nas a first step the presumably must important part of the FSI, namely the full hadronic rescattering in all two-body\nsubsystems of the final state, i.e., N N - and \u03c0N -rescattering, whereas the third particle is treated as a spectator. It is\nstill an approximate treatment, the same as in [10], insofar as only the complete scattering in either the N N - or the\n\u03c0N subsystems are considered, and not a genuine three-body approach. In particular, it will remain a future task to\nsee how critical the violation of unitarity will be.\n\n\u2217\n\nPresent address: Physics Department, Faculty of Science, South Valley University, Sohag, Egypt.\n\n\f2\nIn the next section we will briefly review the model for the elementary photoproduction amplitude which will serve\nas an input for the reaction on the deuteron. Sect. III will introduce the general form of the differential cross section\nfor incoherent pion photoproduction on the deuteron. The separate contributions of the impulse approximation and\nthe two rescatterings to the transition matrix are described in Sect. IV. Details of the actual calculation and the\nresults are presented and discussed in Sect. V. Finally, we close in Sect. VI with a summary and an outlook.\nII.\n\nTHE ELEMENTARY PION PHOTOPRODUCTION ON THE NUCLEON\n\nFor the elementary photoproduction operator, we have taken the effective Lagrangian model of Schmidt et al. [14]\nsince it is given in an arbitrary frame of reference and allows a well defined off-shell continuation as required for studying\npion production on nuclei. It is in contrast to other approaches, where the elementary amplitude is constructed first onshell in the photon-nucleon c.m. frame with subsequent boost into an arbitrary reference frame and some prescription\nfor the off-shell continuation. In the latter method, one loses terms which by chance vanish in the c.m. frame [15].\nIn our approach, the only uncertainty arises from the assignment of the invariant energy for the photon-nucleon\nsubsystem in the resonance propagators as has been discussed in detail in [15]. Here we use the spectator on-shell\napproach. The model of [14] consists of the standard pseudovector Born terms and the contribution of the \u2206(1232)\n3/2\nresonance. For details we refer to [14]. The parameters of the \u2206 resonance are fixed by fitting the experimental M1+\nmultipole. With respect to the parameters used in [14], there was only a slight change in the mass of the \u2206(1232)\nresonance for which we took a value of 1233 MeV. The quality of the model can be judged by a comparison with the\nMAID analysis [13], the Mainz dispersion analysis [16] and the VPI analysis [12] as shown in Fig. 1, and one notes\nquite a good agreement.\nIn Fig. 2 we compare our results for the differential cross sections with the MAID analysis [13] and with experimental\ndata. For \u03c0 + and \u03c0 0 photoproduction on the proton the data are taken from [17, 18, 19] (MAMI), whereas for \u03c0 \u2212\nphotoproduction we took the data from [20] (Tokyo). In general, we obtain quite a good agreement with the data,\nespecially in the region of the \u2206(1232) resonance at 330 MeV. Also in comparison with the MAID analysis our\nelementary production operator does quite well in this energy region. One notes only small discrepancies which very\nlikely come from the fact that no other resonances besides the \u2206(1232) are included in our model.\nThe total cross sections for the different pion channels are shown in Fig. 3 and compared with experimental data.\n2\nIn general, we obtain a good agreement with the data using the small value f\u03c0N\n/4\u03c0 = 0.069 for the pion-nucleon\n\u2212\ncoupling constant. The agreement with the data from [20] and [21] for \u03c0 photoproduction on the neutron is again\nsatisfactory. In case of the \u03c0 + photoproduction, the agreement is good up to a photon energy of about 400 MeV. For\nhigher energies, the D13 resonance, which is not included in our calculation, gives a non-vanishing contribution [13].\nThe \u03c0 + data from [20] are slightly underestimated in the resonance region by our calculation but also by the MAID\nanalysis. Except for a tiny overestimation in the maximum, the description of the data for \u03c0 0 production on the\nproton is also very good. Therefore, this model for the elementary photoproduction amplitude is quite satisfactory\nfor our purpose, namely to incorporate it into the reaction on the deuteron.\nIII.\n\nINCOHERENT PION PRODUCTION ON THE DEUTERON\n\nWe will briefly review the general formalism for incoherent pion production on the deuteron. The general expression\nfor the unpolarized differential cross section of pion photoproduction reaction on the deuteron is given, using the\nconventions of Bjorken and Drell [23], by\nd\u03c3 = (2\u03c0)\u22125 \u03b4 4 (k + d \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 \u2212 q)\n\n2\nX\n1\n1 d3 q d3 p1 d3 p2 MN\n1\n2\n|M(t\u03bc)\nsm m\u03b3 md | ,\n|~v\u03b3 \u2212 ~vd | 2 2\u03c9q~ E1 E2 4\u03c9\u03b3 Ed 6 s,m,t,m ,m\n\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\nd\n\n~\nwhere initial photon and deuteron four-momenta are denoted by k = (\u03c9\u03b3 , ~k ) and\np d = (Ed , d ), respectively, and\n2\n2\nthe four-momenta of final meson and\nq two nucleons by q = (\u03c9q , ~q ) with \u03c9q = m\u03c0 + ~q , m\u03c0 as pion mass, and\n2 +p\npj = (Ej , p~j ) (j = 1, 2) with Ej = MN\n~j2 , respectively, and MN as nucleon mass. Furthermore, m\u03b3 denotes the\nphoton polarization, md the spin projection of the deuteron, s and m total spin and projection of the two outgoing\nnucleons, respectively, t their total isospin, \u03bc the isospin projection of the pion, and ~v\u03b3 and ~vd the velocities of photon\nand deuteron, respectively. The states of all particles are covariantly normalized. The reaction amplitude is denoted\n(t\u03bc)\nby Ms mm\u03b3 md . As in [14], we have chosen as independent variables the pion momentum q, its angles \u03b8\u03c0 and \u03c6\u03c0 ,\nthe polar angle \u03b8pN N and the azimuthal angle \u03c6pN N of the relative momentum p~N N of the two outgoing nucleons as\nindependent variables.\n\n\f3\nThe total and relative momenta of the final N N -system are defined respectively by\nP~N N = p~1 + p\n~2 = ~k \u2212 ~q\n\nand p~N N =\n\n1\n(~\np1 \u2212 ~p2 ) .\n2\n\nThe absolute value of the relative momentum p~N N is given by\ns\n2 (W 2\n2\nEN\n1\nN\nN N \u2212 4MN )\npN N =\n,\n2\n2\n2\n2 EN\nN \u2212 PN N cos \u03b8P pN N\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere EN N and WN N denote total energy and invariant mass of the N N subsystem\nEN N = E1 + E2 = \u03c9\u03b3 + Ed \u2212 \u03c9q ,\n\n2\n2\nWN2 N = EN\nN \u2212 PN N ,\n\n(4)\n\nand \u03b8P pN N is the angle between P~N N and p~N N .\nFor the evaluation we have chosen the laboratory frame where d\u03bc = (Md , ~0 ) with Md as deuteron mass. As\ncoordinate system a right-handed one is taken with z-axis along the momentum ~k of the incoming photon and y-axis\nalong ~k \u00d7 ~q. Thus the outgoing pion defines the scattering plane. Another plane is defined by the momenta of the\noutgoing nucleons which we will call the nucleon plane (see Fig. 4).\nIn the later discussion of the main features of the processes we will consider the semi-inclusive differential cross\nsection d2 \u03c3/d\u03a9\u03c0 , where only the final pion is detected.

The electromagnetic interaction\n(j)\nconsists of the elementary production process on one of the nucleons T\u03c0\u03b3 (j = 1, 2) and in principle a possible\n(N N )\nirreducible two-body production operator T\u03c0\u03b3 . The final \u03c0N N state is then subject to the various hadronic twobody interactions as described by an half-off-shell three-body scattering amplitude T \u03c0N N . In the following, we will\n(N N )\nneglect the electromagnetic two-body production T\u03c0\u03b3 , and the outgoing \u03c0N N scattering state is approximated in\nthis work by\n|~q \u03bc, p~1 p~2 s m t \u2212 \u03bci\n\n(\u2212)\n\n\u03c0N N (\u2212)\n\n= |~\nq \u03bc, p~1 p~2 s m t \u2212 \u03bci + G0\n\n(T \u03c0N (1) + T \u03c0N (2) + T N N )|~q \u03bc, p~1 p~2 s m t \u2212 \u03bci ,\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c0N N (\u2212)\n\nwhere |~q \u03bc, p~1 p~2 s m t \u2212 \u03bci denotes the free \u03c0N N plane wave, G0\nthe free \u03c0N N propagator, T \u03c0N (j) the reaction\nNN\noperator for \u03c0N -scattering on nucleon \"j\", and T\nthe corresponding one for N N -scattering. This means, we include\nbesides the pure impulse approximation (IA), which is defined by the e.m. pion production on one of the nucleons\nalone, only the complete rescattering by the final state interaction within each of the two-body subsystems. Therefore,\nthe total transition matrix element reads in this approximation\n(t\u03bc) IA\n(t\u03bc) N N\n(t\u03bc) \u03c0N\nM(t\u03bc)\ns m m\u03b3 md = M s m m\u03b3 md + M s m m\u03b3 md + M s m m\u03b3 md ,\n\n(10)\n\nin an obvious notation. A graphical representation of the transition matrix is shown in Fig. 5. We will now consider\nthe different contributions in detail.\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nThe impulse approximation\n\nHere we briefly review the relevant formulae from [14]. In the IA the final state interaction is neglected and the pion\nand the NN-final states are described by pure plane waves (see Fig. 5(a)). For the spin (|smi) and isospin (|t \u2212 \u03bci)\npart of the two nucleon wave functions we use a coupled spin-isospin basis |sm, t \u2212 \u03bci. The antisymmetric final NN\nplane wave function thus has the form\n1\np1 i(1) |~\np2 i(2) \u2212 (\u2212)s+t |~\np2 i(1) |~\np1 i(2) )|sm , t \u2212 \u03bci ,\n|~\np1 , p~2 , sm, t \u2212 \u03bci = \u221a (|~\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the superscript indicates to which particle the ket refers. In the case of charged pions, only the t = 1 channel\ncontributes whereas for \u03c0 0 production both t = 0 and t = 1 channels have to be taken into account.

Specifically, we have taken the deuteron wave function from [24]\nand the interaction in the separable representation of [25, 26]. Explicitly, we have included all partial waves with\ntotal angular momentum J \u2264 3. Also in the case of \u03c0N rescattering we have used the separable energy-dependent\n\u03c0N potential of [27] and have considered all S-, P - and D-waves. The remaining three dimensional integrals in (27)\n\u2032\nover p~N\n~2\u2032 are evaluated numerically. We would like to remark, that we have obtained essentially\nN and in (34) over p\nthe same results if we take the Bonn r-space potential [11] instead of the Paris one.\nThe discussion of our results is divided into two parts. First, we will discuss the influence of FSI on the total cross\nsection by comparing the pure IA with the inclusion of two-body rescattering in the final state. Furthermore, we\nwill confront our results with experimental data and other theoretical calculations. In the second part, we will then\nconsider the semi-exclusive differential cross section d2 \u03c3/d\u03a9\u03c0 where only the pion is detected in the final state.\n\n\f7\nA.\n\nTotal Cross Section\n\nOur results for the total cross sections in IA alone and with FSI effects included are presented in Fig. 6. In order to\nshow in greater detail the relative influence of rescattering effects on the total cross sections, we show in Fig. 7 the effect\nIA+N N +\u03c0N\nIA\nof complete rescattering relative to the IA by the ratio \u03c3tot\n/\u03c3tot\nand in Fig. 8 the effect of \u03c0N -rescattering\nIA+N N +\u03c0N\nIA+N N\nIA\nalone relative to the complete effect by the ratio \u03c3tot\n/\u03c3tot\n, where \u03c3tot\ndenotes the total cross section in\nIA+N N\nIA+N N +\u03c0N\nthe impulse approximation, \u03c3tot\nthe one including only N N rescattering, and \u03c3tot\nthe one including in\naddition \u03c0N rescattering contributions. One readily notes the importance of rescattering effects, in particular for the\n\u03c0 0 channel. FSI leads in all cases, to a reduction of the total cross section, except close to the production threshold,\nwhere for charged pions one notes a sizeable increase and above about 450 MeV. The sizeable effect of \u03c0N rescattering\nin the threshold region confirms the previous results in [3] for the coherent reaction and in [9, 28] for the incoherent\none. Furthermore, it has been pointed out already in [9], that also for charged pion channels rescattering effects are\nimportant in the threshold region.\nIn the energy range of the \u2206(1232) resonance, one finds the strongest reduction by rescattering effects which arise\npredominantly from N N rescattering, whereas the influence of \u03c0N rescattering appears almost negligible, about an\norder of magnitude smaller, as is evident from Fig. 8. Only for neutral pion production \u03c0N rescattering becomes\nnoticable below the \u2206 region and amounts to about 40 percent of the total effect near 175 MeV. The reason for\nthis relatively small effect from \u03c0N rescattering lies in the much smaller \u03c0N -interaction in comparison to the N N interaction. This is manifest by the fact that the S-wave scattering length of \u03c0N -scattering is about two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the one of N N -scattering.\nWhile for charged pion photoproduction FSI effects are relatively small, not more than about 5 percent, they are\nquite strong in the case of neutral pion photoproduction, reaching a maximum of about 60 percent at 175 MeV and\nstill about 35 percent in the \u2206 region. The large N N FSI effect in neutral pion production has two related sources.\nThe first arises from the fact that for the \u03c0 0 channel the IA contains a contribution from the coherent process because\nthe final N N plane wave contains a deuteron bound state component. This part, which is absent for charged pion\nproduction, is automatically excluded as soon as the N N interaction is switched on, because the scattering state is\northogonal to the deuteron ground state. The second source is the change in the radial wave function of the final N N\npartial waves by the interaction. The latter is also responsible for the reduction of the charged pion channels.\nFig. 9 shows a comparison of our results for the total cross sections for \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 photoproduction with experimental\ndata. In view of the fact that data for \u03c0 + production in the \u2206 region are not available, we concentrate the discussion\non \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 data. In the case of \u03c0 \u2212 production we have taken the experimental data from [6, 29, 30] while for\n\u03c0 0 production we compare our results with the experimental data from [8]. One readily notes, that in agreement\nwith earlier results the pure IA cannot describe the experimental data, especially in the case of \u03c0 0 production. The\ninclusion of such effects improves the agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions considerably.\nOnly in the maximum of \u03c0 0 production our model overestimates the measured total cross section by about 6%.\nFinally, we compare our results with the theoretical predictions from [10] as shown in Fig. 10. Surprisingly, one\nnotes for the impulse approximation a significant difference for charged pion production which cannot be attributed to\nthe use of different elementary production operators. A possible explanation for this feature will be presented in the\nnext section, where we will discuss the differential cross sections. On the other hand, inclusion of FSI leads in our case\nto a reduction whereas an enhancement was found in [10] for charged pion production. As a result, one finds quite\nclose agreement for the two calculations, if FSI is included. On the contrary, for neutral pion production we obtain\nreasonable agreement in the IA with [10], only in the maximum and at higher energies one notes some differences which\nvery likely come from the neglect of higher resonances in our elementary photoproduction model. Both calculations\npredict a strong reduction by FSI leading to a satisfactory agreement. The remaining small differences probably stem\nfrom different pion photoproduction operators and from different realistic N N potential models, since in [10] the\nBonn r-space potential model [11] has been used.\nB.\n\nDifferential Cross Section\n\nWe begin the discussion by presenting the results for the differential cross sections in the pure IA and with rescattering included in Fig. 11. Here one sees that the major contribution from FSI appears at forward pion angles, i.e.,\nat angles less than 90\u25e6 , predominantly from N N rescattering, whereas rescattering effects become quite small for\nbackward angles. As already noted for the total cross section, the overall effect is quite small for charged pions,\nreaching a maximal reduction at \u03b8\u03c0 = 0\u25e6 of about 15 percent and decreasing rapidly with increasing angle. In the\ncase of the \u03c0 0 channel, the results for the total cross section have already shown that the effect of rescattering is large.\nAgain one notes that the dominant effect appears at forward pion angles resulting in a strong reduction of the order\nof 40 percent. At 90\u25e6 the reduction is still sizeable but decreases to a tiny effect at 180\u25e6 .\n\n\f8\nAnother interesting feature is that for charged pion production in contrast to \u03c0 0 production the angular distribution\nof the emitted pion is more and more forward peaked with increasing photon energy. Its origin are the Born terms\nwhich are absent for \u03c0 0 production. This is demonstrated in Fig. 12 where the separate contributions from Born and\nresonance terms are shown. More than 70 percent of the differential cross section at \u03b8\u03c0 = 0 comes from the Born\nterms.\nA comparison with experimental data from [6] for \u03c0 \u2212 production and from [8] for \u03c0 0 production is shown in Figs. 13\nand 14. Since in [8] the differential cross sections for the reaction d(\u03b3, \u03c0 0 )np are given in the so-called \u03b3N c.m. frame\nwe have transformed the differential cross sections from the lab frame to the \u03b3N c.m. frame. The pion angle in the\n\u03b3N c. m. frame is denoted by \u03b8\u03c0\u22c6 .\nFor \u03c0 \u2212 production the small reduction at forward angles leads at 350 MeV to an improved and satisfactory description of the data at forward angles. At the lower energy of 250 MeV FSI effects are small, but one notes in the\nmaximum around 90\u25e6 an underestimation of the data by about 15 percent while at 180\u25e6 the theory is slightly higher\nthan the data. Also at 420 MeV the theory is at forward angles slightly above the data but below in the backward\ndirection. However, the overall description is quite satisfactory. The comparison between theory and experiment is\neven better for \u03c0 0 production, where the inclusion of FSI yields an almost perfect description.\nNow we compare our results for the differential cross sections with the theoretical predictions of Levchuk et al. [10]\nin Fig. 15. For the \u03c0 0 channel we find quite a good agreement in the maximum. At forward angles one notes for the\npure IA as well as with inclusion of FSI only at the lowest energy agreement, whereas for the two higher energies larger\ndifferences appear. In the backward direction we find for all three energies a significantly larger cross section already\nfor the IA while FSI effects are tiny (see right panels of Fig. 15). Again we suspect differences in the elementary\nproduction amplitude to be responsible for this fact. However, for charged pion production the situation is quite\ndifferent. Major discrepancies are evident in the forward direction for the IA. While we find an increased forward\npeaking of the cross section with increasing energy, the cross section remains small in [10] at \u03b8\u03c0 = 0. Analysing in\ndetail the contributions from the s = 0 and s = 1 parts of the N N final state plane wave (see left panel of Fig. 16), we\ndiscovered that we could reproduce the results of [10] if we assume a wrong antisymmetrization for the s = 0 channel,\ni.e., using instead of (11) for s = 0\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n(35)\np1 i(1) |~\np2 i(2) + (\u2212)t |~\np2 i(1) |~\np1 i(2) |00, t \u2212 \u03bci ,\n|~\np1 ~\np2 , 00, t \u2212 \u03bci = \u221a |~\n2\nand keeping the form of (11) for the s = 1 channel. This is demonstrated in the right panel of Fig. 16 where we obtain\nin this case also a decrease of the cross section at 0\u25e6 very similar to [10]. This wrong antisymmetrization for the s = 0\nchannel corresponds in the uncoupled representation, as used in [10], to an interchange of the momenta of the two\nnucleons alone without interchanging the spin quantum numbers. This we have checked by using also an uncoupled,\ni.e., helicity basis leading to the same result. However, we can only suspect that the difference to the results of [10]\nmay originate from such an error in the antisymmetrization.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we have investigated the influence of final state interaction effects on incoherent single pion photoproduction on the deuteron in the \u2206(1232) resonance region. The elementary production operator on the nucleon is taken\nin an effective Lagarangian model used earlier in a study of the same process in the impulse approximation, where all\nkind of final state interactions and other two-body operators were neglected. As presumably dominant final state interaction effects we have included the complete rescattering contributions in the two-body N N - and \u03c0N -subsystems.\nAs models for the interaction of the N N - and \u03c0N -subsystems we used separable representations of realistic N N\nand \u03c0N interactions which give a good description of the corresponding phase shifts. For N N rescattering, we have\nincluded all partial waves with total angular momentum J \u2264 3 and for \u03c0N rescattering S- through D-waves.\nWe found that the influence of N N and \u03c0N rescattering reduces the total cross sections in the \u2206(1232) resonance\nregion for charged pion photoproduction by about 5 percent and for \u03c0 0 photoproduction reaction, where rescattering\nis much more important, by about 35 percent in the maximum. Furthermore, \u03c0N rescattering appears to be much\nless important compared to N N rescattering. In comparison with experimental data, the inclusion of rescattering\neffects leads to an improved agreement with experimental data. Only in the maximum of \u03c0 0 production our model\noverestimates slightly the measured total cross section by a few percent. With respect to the theoretical predictions\nof [10], we obtained very similar results when FSI is included.\nThe study of the differential cross section revealed that the reduction by inclusion of FSI appears predominantly\nat pion forward angles by about 15 percent for charged pion production and for the \u03c0 0 channel by about 40 percent.\nFor pions emitted in the backward direction the influence of rescattering is much less important. As already noted for\nthe total cross section, \u03c0N rescattering has a very small effect on the final results. In comparison with experiment,\n\n\f9\nthe inclusion of FSI yields a very satisfactory agreement with data. Small discrepancies remain at backward pion\nangles. In comparison with the results of [10] in the IA, we found for charged pion channels at forward angles a large\ndifference between both calculations. A detailed analysis gave as possible explanation a wrong antisymmetrization for\nthe final two-proton or two-neutron state. After inclusion of rescattering effects we obtained a satisfactory agreement\nwith [10].\nThe present study will serve as a basis for further investigations including a three-body treatment the final \u03c0N N\nsystem for the lowest and most important partial waves. This will insure the important unitarity condition and may\nresult in an even better agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions for \u03c0 0 photoproduction.\nA further interesting topic concerns the study of polarization observables giving more detailed information on the\ndynamics and thus providing more stringent tests for theoretical models. As future refinements we consider also the\nuse of a more sophisticated elementary production operator, which will allow one to extend the present approach\nto higher energies, and the role of irreducible two-body contributions to the e.m. pion production operator, e.g.\ninteraction of the intermediate particle of the nucleon and \u2206 pole diagrams with the spectator nucleon. In the long\nrun, one would also need to extend the formalism to the threshold region for which the elementary production operator\nhas to be improved. This process is of great interest since experimental data for the reaction d(\u03b3, \u03c0 0 n)p have been\nmeasured recently in Mainz (MAMI/TAPS) and Saskatoon (SAL) [31]. Moreover, the formalism should be extended\nto investigate coherent and incoherent electroproduction of pions on the deuteron including final state interaction\neffects in both the threshold and the \u2206(1232) resonance regions in order to analyze recent results from MAMI [32].\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Alexander Fix for useful discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript.
