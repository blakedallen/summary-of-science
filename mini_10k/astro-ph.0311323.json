The\nclusters, all of which start to resolve into stars, have MV 606 = \u22128.9 to \u20139.8 mag, significantly brighter than the\npeak of the luminosity function of Milky Way globular clusters. Their colors suggest a metallicity [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22121.9\ndex, typical of metal-poor Galactic globular clusters. The specific frequency of clusters is at a minimum normal,\ncompared to spiral galaxies. However, since only a small portion of the system has been surveyed it is more\nlikely that the luminosity and mass normalized cluster content is higher, like that seen in elliptical galaxies and\ngalaxy clusters. This suggests that NGC 2915 resembles a key phase in the early hierarchical assembly of galaxies\n- the epoch when much of the old stellar population has formed, but little of the stellar disk. Depending on the\nsubsequent interaction history, such systems could go on to build-up larger elliptical galaxies, evolve into normal\nspirals, or in rare circumstances remain suspended in their development to become systems like NGC 2915.\nSubject headings: galaxies: star clusters - galaxies: individual (NGC 2915) - galaxies: evolution - galaxies:\nhalos\ndynamical tracer for the mass distribution; not coincidentally\nNGC 2915 has one of the highest known mass-to-light ratios in\na single galaxy (MCBF96). Furthermore, while its optical morphology is that of a blue compact dwarf (BCD; Meurer, Mackie,\n& Carignan 1994, hereafter MMC94), its H I disk clearly shows\nspiral arms which are not apparent in the optical.\nIn this Letter, we report the discovery of three luminous GCs\nfound in Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS; Ford et al. 2002) images of NGC 2915 that were\nobtained in order to look for a stellar heating source for the H I\ndisk. That issue will be discussed in a separate article (Meurer\net al. 2003; in preparation, hereafter Meu03).\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nAll galaxies with massive old stellar populations are thought\nto contain globular clusters (GCs). They are particularly noticeable where the old stellar population is dominant such as in elliptical (E), dwarf elliptical (dE), and central Dominant (cD), as\nwell as spiral galaxies with prominent bulges. Dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies generally do not contain GCs, probably because they\nhave insufficient mass to make their formation likely. The exceptions are the most massive dwarf spheroidals Fornax (Hodge\n1961) and Sagitarius (Ibata, Gilmore & Irwin 1994) which each\nhave at least 4 GCs. Disk galaxies dominated by population I\nstars contain fewer GCs per unit luminosity, presumably because of star formation in the disk after the formation of the\npopulation II component. Galaxies with a high MHI /LB ratio\nhave yet to form much of their baryonic mass into stars. They\ntypically are blue and not considered likely hosts for populous\nGC systems.\nNGC 2915 is an extreme gas rich galaxy having MHI /LB =\n1.7 M\u2299 /LB,\u2299 (Meurer et al. 1996, hereafter MCBF96). Its\nregularly rotating H I disk extends to over 5 times beyond\nthe readily detectable optical emission providing an excellent\n\n2. DATA AND ANALYSIS\n\nACS Wide Field Camera (WFC) images were obtained of\na field centered at 09h 25m 36.s48, \u201376\u25e6 35\u2032 52.\u2032\u2032 4 (J2000). The\nimages cover projected radii of 45\u2032\u2032 to 257 \u2032\u2032 , whereas the Holmberg radius RHo = 114\u2032\u2032 . We obtained 2, 2, 4 images for a total\nexposure of 2480s, 2600s, 5220s in the filters F475W (g475 ),\nF606W (V606 ), and F814W (I814 ), respectively. The basic processing of the images was done using the CALACS pipeline\n(Hack 1999). We used the program Apsis (Blakeslee et al.\n\n1\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, The Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North Charles Street, Baltimore, MD 21218; meurer@pha.jhu.edu\nUCO/Lick Observatory, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.\n3 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771.\n4 W.M.

In order to compare our observations\nwith previous work, we convert the previous work to this system, as needed, using the calibrations of Sirianni et al (2003,\nin preparation). The most important correction is to the V606\nphotometry, since the F606W filter straddles the wavelength of\ntraditional V and R filters.\n3. RESULTS\n\nTable 1 presents adopted global properties for NGC 2915.\nThe foreground extinction, E(B \u2212 V), is from the Schlegel,\nFinkbeiner & Davis (1998) extinction maps. It is significantly\nlarger than E(B \u2212 V) = 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 estimated by MMC94, but\nconsistent with the position of the field star Red Giant Branch\n(RGB; Meu03). Extinction corrected photometry employing\nthe Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (1989) extinction curve is denoted with a \"0\" subscript. The distance, D was derived from\nthe field star RGB tip (Meu03). It is consistent with but improves on previous estimates D = 5.3 \u00b1 1.3 Mpc (MMC94) and\nD = 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 Mpc (Karachentsev et al. 2003). The remaining\nquantities in Table 1 were derived from MMC94 and MCBF96\nafter correcting to the new E(B \u2212 V) and D.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the three sources are clearly GCs whose\nbrightest stars are resolved. Table 2 compiles the properties of\nthe clusters. The photometric quantities were measured using\na circular aperture having a radius of r = 3\u2032\u2032 , with the local sky\nsubtracted using an annulus having radii of 5\u2032\u2032 and 7.5\u2032\u2032 . The\ncluster size r1/2 is the circular aperture radius encompassing\nhalf the V606 light as measured from curves of growth.\nCompared to Galactic GCs, these clusters are large and luminous, but not abnormally so. Only 16% of the clusters in the\nHarris (1996) database13 have V606 luminosities brighter than\nG3; only three clusters are more luminous than G1. The clusters' r1/2 ranges from about 5 to 9 pc, placing them in the upper\nquartile of Galactic GCs which have r1/2 ranging from 0.3 to\n24.7 pc (Harris 1996). The clusters are noticeably elongated\nwith ellipticity \u01eb \u2261 1 \u2212 b/a similar to the canonical flattened\nGalactic GCs M22 and \u03c9 Cen (\u01eb = 0.14, 0.17, respectively; Harris 1996). The combination of high luminosity and appreciable\nflattening is also seen in the cluster M31-G1 (Pritchet & van\nden Bergh 1984; Meylan et al. 2001).\nThe (g475 \u2212 V606 )0 and (V606 \u2212 I814 )0 colors of the clusters are\ncompared to Milky Way GCs (Harris 1996) in Fig. 2. Their\ncolors are virtually identical implying similar metallicities, assuming they are old and nearly coeval. We derive their metallicity by fitting the metallicty - color relationship from the Harris\ndatabase after converting the colors to (V606 \u2212 I814 )0 . We employed an unweighted least squares fit with an iterative 2.5\u03c3\nrejection resulting in [Fe/H] = \u22125.37 + 5.36(V606 \u2212 I814 )0 with a\ndispersion of 0.29 dex. The metallicity for the three clusters\nis then [Fe/H] = \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.4 dex, consistent with low metallicity Galactic GCs. Our stellar population analysis, in progress\n(Meu03), indicates that the stars at the outskirts of the clusters\nhave very similar I814,0 versus (V606 \u2212 I814 )0 color-magnitude diagrams, dominated by a narrow and blue RGB. This is also consistent with low [Fe/H], if the clusters are old.\n4. DISCUSSION\n13\n\nhttp://physwww.physics.mcmaster.ca/\u223charris/mwgc.dat\n\n4.1. Cluster formation efficiency\nBecause of the blue core and gas rich nature of NGC 2915\nwe had not expected to find GCs in our images. However,\nin retrospect this discovery should not have been surprising.\nGCs have previously been discovered around morphologically\nsimilar systems; \u00d6stlin, Bergvall & R\u00f6nnback (1998) find a\nconsiderable population of at least 65 old GCs about the Blue\nCompact (albeit not dwarf) galaxy ESO 338-IG04. In addition,\nNGC 2915 is not a dwarf system in terms of mass, and optical\nimaging shows that it to be dominated by an older stellar population for R > 0.5 Kpc (MMC94). These facts suggest that old\nGCs might have been expected.\nAre the number of clusters found anomalous? To address this\nwe estimate the total number of clusters in the system. Unfortunately, our images sample only a small fraction of the galaxy.\nIf the GCs are distributed spherically out to RHI = 10\u2032 (where\nthe H I distribution ends; MCBF96), then we have only surveyed 3.5% of the available area. Here we consider two cases\nfor the possible distribution of old clusters. Case (1) assumes\nthat we are lucky and have managed to observe all the clusters in NGC 2915. While this is unlikely, it provides a strict\nlower limit to the cluster formation efficiency. The more likely\ncase (2) is that the globular cluster system is like that of more\nluminous systems - having a spherically symmetric power-law\nradial distribution in number per unit area - N(R) \u221d R\u03b1 (Harris\n1991). We assumes this extends between R = 0.5 Kpc and RHI ,\nwhere the minimum R insures that the predictions are finite and\nwas chosen to correspond to the size of the central star forming population (MMC94). For \u22122.5 < \u03b1 < \u22120.5 we estimate\nthat the total number of clusters in the system is 7 to 12 times\nhigher than found on our images. For case (2) we adopt a correction factor of 9. Hence there are at least 3 GCs in the system\n(case 1), with a more likely number being \u223c 27 (case 2).\nIn principle, we should correct the total GC estimate for the\nfinite luminosity sampling of the images. However, SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) catalogs of our images show that\nwe can detect extended objects down to V606 \u2248 27 which corresponds to an MV 606 \u223c \u22122 for sources in NGC2915. This is\nwell below the peak of the GC luminosity function MV \u223c \u22127.5\n(Secker 1992; revised to agree with the Hipparcos RR Lyrae\nzero point, e.g. Carretta et al. 2000). Hence we apply no luminosity sampling correction. The fact that we only have found\nGCs much brighter than this peak is somewhat puzzling.\nWe will consider three measures of cluster formation efficiency. First, the specific frequency, SN = NT 100.4(MV +15) , is\nthe V luminosity normalized cluster content (Harris & van den\nBergh 1981). SN is typically around 1 for spiral galaxies and\nincreases towards earlier galaxy types, with E galaxies having\nSN \u223c 4. In the center of galaxy clusters SN ranges from 2.5\nto 12.5 (Blakeslee, Tonry, & Metzger 1997; Blakeslee 1999).\nWe consider two measures of the mass normalized contribution: \u03b7GC the number of clusters per 109 M\u2299 in dynamical\nmass (Blakeslee et al. 1997), and \u01ebcl , the fractional baryonic\n(gas and stars) mass in GCs (McLaughlin 1999). As done\nby McLaughlin (1999) we assume each cluster has an average\nmass hMcl i = 2.4 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 when calculating \u01ebcl . Blakeslee\net al. (1997) find an average \u03b7GC = 0.7 with a scatter of 30%,\nwhile McLaughlin (1999) computes an average \u01ebcl = 0.0026\nwith a 20% uncertainty.\nTable 3 tabulates SN , \u03b7GC and \u01ebcl for NGC 2915 under the\nabove two cases. Relevant quantities used for these calculations\n\n\fGlobular clusters in NGC 2915\nare given in Table 1. Table 3 also lists literature values and uncertainties of the efficiencies for \"normal\" systems. The uncertainty of our estimates are large: for a Poissonian distribution\nyielding a count of 3, the 95% confidence limits on the cluster\nformation efficiencies are 0.3 and 2.3 times the estimated value.\nWe find that at a minimum (case 1) SN is close to normal for a\nspiral galaxy while while \u03b7GC and \u01ebcl are low compared to normal globular cluster systems. In the more likely case (2), SN is\nvery high compared to normal gas rich systems. \u03b7GC and \u01ebcl are\nalso somewhat high compared to literature values, but in reasonable agreement considering the Poissonian uncertainty of\nour measurements. While we can not rule out the possibility\nthat NGC 2915 is like a normal spiral galaxy in terms of SN ,\nit is more likely that it has a high luminosity normalized cluster content, whereas the mass normalized content is closer to\nnormal.\n4.2. A missing link in galaxy evolution?\nIt is interesting to interpret these results within the framework\nof hierarchical evolution through comparison with other systems. Blakeslee (1999) has discussed how the SN of the young\nMilky Way must have been fairly high, similar to the values for\ncluster E galaxies, after the formation of the Galactic halo but\nbefore stellar disk formation. The increase in luminosity from\nlater star formation in the disk would cause a decrease in the\nGalactic SN to its present low value, while leaving the number\nof GCs per unit mass unchanged. In NGC 2915 we have an example of a present-day galaxy with an old stellar component,\nincluding GCs, but a spiral disk that is still mainly in the form\nof gas.\nIn this sense, NGC 2915, like the centers of rich galaxy clusters, has an elevated value of SN compared to typical spirals because of a lower efficiency for converting gas into stars. Clusters typically have 2\u20135 times as much mass in gas as in stars\n(Arnaud et al. 1992), similar to what we see in NGC 2915. The\ndifference, however, is that the gas in clusters now resides in\nthe hot intracluster medium, while the gas in NGC 2915 still retains the potential to be converted into stars. To a large extent,\nthe fate of the gaseous disk (and the future evolution of SN in\nNGC 2915) must depend on the surrounding environment.\nSimulations show that when a disk galaxy enters the environment of a rich galaxy cluster, much of the gas in its disk and\nhalo will be removed by the combination of tidal and ram pressure stripping (Abadi, Moore & Bower 1999; Bekki, Couch &\nShioya 2002; Bekki et al. 2001; Gnedin 2003). For example, if\na system similar to the Galaxy were to fall into a rich cluster it\nwould have its gas disk truncated down to a radius of a few kpc\nwithin a few tens of Myr by ram pressure stripping alone (Abadi\n\n3\n\net al. 1999). Indeed, models of present day evolution of galaxy\nclusters invoke mildly truncated star formation in field galaxies\naccreting onto the cluster as the cause of the Butcher-Oemler effect (Balogh, Navarro & Morris 2000; Kodama & Bower 2001).\nIt is likely that in their early evolution clusters were assembled\nfrom building blocks similar to NGC 2915 which had their ISM\nstripped from them by these mechanisms. The stripped gas was\nthen virialized to become the cluster X-ray halo. In this scenario galaxy clusters have high SN because they formed out of\nsubclumps which had already efficiently formed star clusters\nbut which never had the chance to form disks.\nIn a less hostile environment, a building block similar to\nNGC 2915 could go on to form a normal spiral galaxy. If the H I\ndisk of NGC 2915 were to be perturbed enough to efficiently\nform stars in a fairly quiescent fashion this would result in an\nadditional 7 \u00d7 108M\u2299 of stars forming with no additional GCs.\nAssuming a M/LV \u223c 1 M\u2299 /LV,\u2299 for the additional stars then\nthe system would evolve towards SN \u223c 2, a fairly normal value\nfor spiral galaxies, while \u03b7GC and \u01ebcl remain fixed at their normal values. The SN in NGC 2915 is then anomalously high\nbecause the formation of its disk has not proceeded, presumably due to a lack of external perturbations (MCBF96). If so,\nthen we may expect other galaxies with high MHI /LB ratios\nand extended H I disks to also have a significant GC population, especially if they have a strong old population.\nWhile this scenario seems compelling, we caution that it is\npossible that NGC 2915 only superficially resembles the building block we describe. We have not proven that the number of\nclusters is anomalously high. Furthermore, we can not yet rule\nout the possibility that the clusters are of higher metallicity and\nyounger than Galactic GCs. This is shown in figure 2 where we\noverplot Bruzual & Charlot (2003) population models on the\ntwo color diagram illustrating the strong age-metallicity degeneracy for the filters used here. If the clusters are not old, they\nmay represent the remnants of a starburst occurring as recently\nas a few Gyr ago. We are undertaking additional observations\n(imaging and spectroscopic) to get a more accurate census of\nstar clusters in the NGC 2915 system and determine their nature. The results of these studies should determine whether\nNGC 2915 is just a gas rich galaxy with a peculiar star formation history, or whether it truly presents us with a rare local\nview of how galaxies looked in the epoch of cluster assembly.\nACS was developed under NASA contract NAS 5-32864,\nand this research has been supported by NASA grant NAG57697.
