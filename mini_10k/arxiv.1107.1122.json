Understanding the\nunderlying mechanisms allows one to tailor materials with novel functionalities. In this sense,\nSuperconductor/Ferromagnet (S/F) hybrids are paradigmatic. Their transport properties result\nfrom the interplay of a variety of nanoscale physical mechanisms: conventional [1] or\nunconventional proximity effects [2], injection of spin-polarized currents [3], and effects\nrelated to stray magnetic fields which emanate from the F [4,5]. More work has been devoted\nto S/F hybrids with conventional low- TC superconductors (see e.g. [6,7,8]) than with high- TC\nsuperconductors (see a review in [9]).\nMuch attention has been paid to S/F systems in which changes in the F magnetic state\ninduce a resistance switching in the S. For example, in certain F/S/F trilayers, the resistance\nnear the critical temperature TC depends on whether the F layers' magnetizations are parallel\nor antiparallel [10-20]. This effect has been explained in terms of various mechanisms that\nproduce a shift of the critical temperature \u0394TC depending upon the configuration of the F\nlayers: Cooper-pair breaking either i) due to the exchange field induced in the S\n[10,12,18,19,23] or ii) due to the accumulation of spin polarized quasiparticles [11,13,16,22]\nand iii) Cooper-pair formation due to crossed Andreev reflection [24]. On the other hand,\nvarious low-TC S/F systems show resistance switching effects produced by stray magnetic\nfields generated by the F layers' domain structure [5,14,15,17,20]. This possibility has also\nbeen contemplated for high-TC systems [21].\nIn this article, we report on reversible resistance switching effects caused by stray\nmagnetic fields in high-TC S/F hybrids. Specifically, we show that the tunable domain\nstructure of a F (Co/Pt superlattice) causes hysteretic magneto-transport in a high-TC\nsuperconducting YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 (YBCO) film via (i) the creation of vortices/antivortices and\n(ii) the pinning of the vortices that are induced by the external applied field. While (i) induces\n\n2\n\n\fan increase of the mixed-state resistance, (ii) induces a decrease. These changes depend upon\nboth the magnetic history and the direction of the external applied magnetic field. Previously,\nsimilar experiments in which a low-TC S (Nb) was used were interpreted in terms of TC\nvariations caused by Cooper-pair breaking, and stray magnetic field effects were dismissed\n[19]. However, our combination of Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), Anomalous Hall\nEffect (AHE) [25] measurements, current dependent magneto-transport measurements and\nmagnetostatic calculations allow us to unambiguously connect the resistance switching\nobserved here to vortex dynamics effects induced by the stray fields. Notably, we can\ncorrelate the magnetic history dependent pinning of vortices [26] with the varying F domain\nstructure.\nFor the fabrication of the S/F structure, a 20 nm thick c-axis YBCO films was grown on\n(001) SrTiO3 using pulsed laser deposition (KrF excimer). Atomic force microscopy (not\nshown) revealed a flat film surface (roughness ~ 1 nm). A Pt10\nmultilayer (with Pt10\n\nnm\n\nnm/(Co0.6 nm/Pt1 nm)5/Pt5 nm\n\nthe buffer layer) was subsequently sputtered ex situ at room\n\ntemperature directly on top the YBCO. A bridge (250 \u03bcm long \u00d7 40 \u03bcm wide) for standard\nfour-probe resistance and Hall (voltage perpendicular to current) measurements was optically\nlithographed and ion etched. Magneto-transport measurements were carried out in a He flow\ncryostat equipped with a rotatable sample holder and a 5.5 kOe electromagnet. The zero-field\ncritical temperature obtained from R(T) measurements (the onset of the superconducting\ntransition is defined as the temperature at which the resistance falls to 90% of the normal-state\nvalue) was TC = 72 K for the S/F sample and TC = 82 K for a single 20 nm thick YBCO film\n(with no F on top). The latter was used as reference sample. The \"zero-resistance\" state (as\ndefined by a measured V~10-7 V for an injected current I=1 \u03bcA) was achieved at T~66 K for\nboth samples. Note that shunting of the injected currents across the Co/Pt multilayer occurs\nuntil the YBCO layer resistance has significantly decreased with respect to its normal-state\n\n3\n\n\fvalue, which is evidenced by the very different normal-state sheet resistances of the S/F\nsample RS (90K ) ~ 6 \u03a9 and the single YBCO film RS (90K ) ~ 320 \u03a9.\nFigure 1 (a) shows the central results of this paper. This figure displays the mixed-state\nresistance vs. field of the S/F sample for various angles \u03b8 between H and the c-axis (see\ninset). Measurements were carried out in constant Lorentz force geometry (current J \u22a5 H ).\nFor each \u03b8 , R(H ) was measured as H was swept from positive to negative ( RDEC (H ) , black\nline) and vice versa ( RINC (H ) , red dashed line). After demagnetization [27] (with H applied\nat \u03b8 from the c-axis), a third measurement was performed in which H was swept to positive\nfields from H =0 (the \"virgin\" RVIR (H ) , blue circles). The magneto-transport is hysteretic for\n\nall \u03b8 : depending upon the magnetic history, a switching between high and low resistance\nstates is observed within a range of positive/negative fields, so that RDEC (H ) and RINC (H )\nform two \"lobes\" which appear symmetrically around H = 0 . However, distinct behavior is\n\nobserved for \u03b8 =90o and \u03b8 <90o. Moreover, the zero-field resistance strongly depends on the\nmagnetic history and \u03b8 .\nFor \u03b8 <90o, R DEC (H ) and R INC (H ) coincide except for a range of negative (positive) H !\nwithin which R DEC (H ) < R INC (H ) ( R DEC (H ) > R INC (H ) ). As \u03b8 is increased, the background\nmagneto-resistance diminishes, and the \"lobes\" widen. Regarding the virgin RVR (H ) (blue\ncircles, the curve for \u03b8 =70o is representative of all \u03b8 <90o curves), we observe that RVIR (0 ) is\nabout one order of magnitude higher than R DEC (0 ) = R INC (0) . However, RVIR (H ) eventually\ncrosses under and matches R INC (H ) as H is increased.\nThe behavior for \u03b8 =90o is very different. The background magneto-resistance is nearly\nconstant, and at high field it is over two orders of magnitude lower than for \u03b8 <90o. The\nincreasing and decreasing field branches do not coincide for any H \u2264~ 3 kOe except for\n\nH =0, where they cross. Note that the resistance switching is reversed as compared to the\n4\n\n\fcurves for \u03b8 <90o : here R DEC (H ) > R INC (H ) for negative H , and vice versa for positive H .\nThe virgin RVIR (H ) (blue dots) is higher than R INC (H ) and R DEC (H ) for all H <~3 kOe , and\nmatches the high-field resistance background above that field.\nFigure 1 (b) shows the magneto-transport of a single 20 nm thick YBCO film, which, as\nexpected, does not exhibit hysteresis. Comparison of the curves in Figs. 1 (a) and (b) allow us\nto separate the effects of H (background magneto-resistance induced by flux dynamics in the\nYBCO film) from those caused by the presence of the Co/Pt multilayer.\nIn Figure 2, we demonstrate the correlation between the multilayer's magnetic state and\nthe hysteretic magneto-resistance of the S/F sample. For each \u03b8 , the top panel depicts the\n\npercent resistance switching with respect to the background magneto-resistance, \u0394R(H ) , and\nthe lower panel shows the normalized net perpendicular component of the multilayer's\nmagnetization M \u22a5 (H ) M S (with M S the saturation magnetization).\n\nM \u22a5 (H ) M S was obtained from AHE [25] measurements at T=100 K (i.e. in the normal\nstate). Note that, due to the much lower normal-state sheet resistance of the Co/Pt multilayer\nas compared to the YBCO layer, nearly 98% the injected current flows within the former. The\nmeasured Hall voltage contains both the ordinary component (OHE) and the anomalous one\n(AHE) characteristic of ferromagnetic systems [25]. Unlike AHE, OHE is not hysteretic and\n\nis directly proportional to the component of H\n\nperpendicular to the film plane.\n\nDiscrimination between OHE and AHE is therefore straightforward from a set of Hall effect\nmeasurements for different \u03b8 . This allows for the extraction of the AHE resistance, which is\ndirectly proportional [25] to the net out-of-plane component of the magnetization M \u22a5 (H ) M S\n(normalized).\nFor \u03b8 =0 [Fig. 2 (a)], M \u22a5 (H ) is as expected for a system with strong perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy, in which magnetic reversal occurs via the nucleation and subsequent\n\n5\n\n\fgrowth of domains (eg. [28]). Around the coercive field ( M \u22a5 ~ 0) up/down magnetized\n\ndomains are formed which are expected to be comparable to those in the MFM images of Fig.\n4. For 0< \u03b8 <90o [Fig. 2 (b) and (c)], the remanent perpendicular magnetization M \u22a5 (0 ) ~ M S\n!suggests that the magnetization coherently rotates out-of-plane as H is decreased to zero\nfollowing saturation in high field. As H is reversed, M \u22a5 eventually switches via nucleation\nand growth of reverse domains under the action of the reverse out-of-plane component of H .\nFinally, the magnetization again coherently rotates towards the H direction as the field\nmagnitude is further increased.\nFor \u03b8 =90o, M \u22a5 (H ) [Fig. 2 (d)] and MFM [Fig 4 (a)] imply the following magnetic reversal\nmechanism. At high in-plane H , the magnetization lies essentially in the film plane. As H\nis reduced from its high value to zero, the magnetization gradually rotates out of the film\nplane under the influence of the perpendicular anisotropy and breaks up into domains. The\nremanent domain structure is shown in Fig. 4 (a). In principle, one expects an equal number of\n\"up\" and \"down\" domains, resulting in M \u22a5 =0. Experimentally however, we do see some\nhysteretic effects in M \u22a5 (H ) M S [Fig. 2(d)] which is suggestive of a slight misalignment of\nthe field and the Co/Pt multilayer. This will slightly favor the positively (negatively)\nmagnetized domains following positive (negative) in-plane saturation. This biasing effect is\nrather weak though, yielding a maximum value of M \u22a5 ~0.08 M S . Unexpectedly, this\nmaximum value is obtained at H ~ 0.5 kOe and not at zero field, at which point no canting is\nto be expected, thereby being the field at which the maximum M \u22a5 should occur. The\nexplanation for this discrepancy is not clear at this time but may be related to the existence of\na small in-plane magnetization component at remanence. As H is further reversed beyond\nH ~ 0.5 kOe, the magnetization gradually rotates back in-plane and the domains are\n\nannihilated.\n6\n\n\fWe detail now the correlation between the resistance switching \u0394R(H ) and the\nmagnetization\n\nreversal\n\nfor\n\ndifferent\n\n\u03b8.\n\nFor\n\n\u03b8 < 90o ,\n\nwe\n\ndefined\n\n\u0394R(H ) \u2261 (RDEC (H ) \u2212 RINC (H )) RINC (H ) for H < 0 ( R INC and R DEC are permuted in the formula\nfor H > 0 ). For \u03b8 =90o, given the nearly constant background resistance (see figure 1 (b)), we\ndefined \u0394R(H ) \u2261 (RDEC (H ) \u2212 RDEC (4 kOe)) RDEC (4 kOe) for the decreasing field branch\n(black), and used the same formula with R INC for the increasing field branch (red). For \u03b8 < 90o\n[top panels, Fig. 2 (a)-(c)] \u0394R(H ) dips are observed within the field range in which M \u22a5\nreverses, with \u0394R(H ) at its maximum for M \u22a5 ~ 0. As we change \u03b8 from 0 to 80o the\namplitude of \u0394R(H ) gradually increases, and the dips become smoother and wider, since the\nreversal of M \u22a5 becomes less abrupt. For \u03b8 =90o, [Fig. 2 (d)], a direct correlation between\n\u0394R (H ) and\n\nM \u22a5 (H ) is observed, and the maximum \u0394R (H )\n\n(~90%) occurs at the field\n\nH ~ 0.5 kOe at which the M \u22a5 (H ) M S is maximum. Note also that the sign of \u0394R (H ) is\n\nreversed as compared to the curves for \u03b8 <90o. The most important conclusion of Figure 2 is\nthat, depending on whether H is applied out-of-plane ( \u03b8 <90o) or in-plane ( \u03b8 =90o) the\npresence of a structure of up/down magnetized domains respectively produces a decrease or a\n(relatively larger) increase of the mixed-state resistance. This qualitative behavior is observed\nfor all T between 0.80 TC and 0.99 TC .\nThe current and temperature dependences of \u0394R are shown in Figure 3. In Fig. 3 (a) we\nhave plotted E (J ) at different temperatures (see labels) in H =1 kOe (~ the field at which the\nmaximum \u0394R is observed, see Fig. 2 (c)). The black solid curves correspond to the case in\nwhich the multilayer's magnetization is homogeneous (which is after H is swept from +3.5\nkOe to +1 kOe). The red dashed curves correspond to the case in which the multilayer\npresents a structure of up/down magnetized domains (after H is swept from \u20133.5 kOe to +1\nkOe). It can be seen that the red dashed curves are shifted to the right with respect to the black\n\n7\n\n\fones, which implies a lower resistance when the magnetic domains structure is present. Note\n\nthat this effect spans over a wide temperature range, both above and below the irreversibility\nline (indicated by the black dashed straight line). Figure 3 (b) shows current dependence of\nthe resistance switching \u0394R , which was calculated from the set of E (J ) shown in Fig. 3(a).\nFor a given temperature, \u0394R decreases as J increases. For a given current, \u0394R increases as\nthe temperature decreases. The inset of Figure 3 (b) displays the critical current enhancement\n\u0394J C induced by the domain structure, for several temperatures below the irreversibility line.\n\nTo obtain \u0394J C we measured two E (J ) for each field value, H : one following the application\nof +3.5 kOe, and the other following the application of \u20133.5 kOe . J C from each E (J ) was\ncalculated with the criterion E C =2\u22c510-4 V cm-1. The maximum \u0394J C ~ 2 kA cm-2 is observed\nfor H ~ 1 kOe. This corresponds to the critical current enhancement due to the presence of\nthe domain structure as compared to the case in which the magnetization is homogeneous.\nFigures 3 (c) and (d) show the same measurements as in (a) and (b), but with the field\napplied in-plane (\u03b8=90o). The black solid curves are measured for H =-4 kOe, for which the\nmagnetic superlattice is homogeneously magnetized essentially in-plane. The red dashed\ncurves are measured for H =0.5 kOe, for which the multilayer presents a structure of up/down\nmagnetized domains similar to those in Figure 4 (a). Note that here the red dashed curves are\nshifted to the left with respect to the black ones, which implies a higher resistance when the\nmagnetic domain structure is present. Note that for \u03b8=90o the resistance switching effects also\nspan over a wide temperature range. As shown in Figure 3 (d), \u0394R can reach up to ~ 200% at\nlow temperatures.\nThe current and temperature dependences described above suggest that the resistance\nswitching effects are connected to flux dynamics phenomena, as they are observed in a wide\n\n8\n\n\frange of temperatures, both in the linear and non-linear regimes of E (J ) . In what follows, we\n\ndiscuss in detail the origin of the observed behavior.\nHysteretic resistance switching effects have been previously observed in low- TC S/F\nmultilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy [19]. Those effects were explained by a\nshift of the critical temperature \u0394TC that was produced by the ferromagnet's exchange field. In\nthis scenario, the strongest depression of superconductivity (i.e. that which results in the\nhighest resistance state) corresponds to the case in which the ferromagnet is homogeneously\nmagnetized. Lower resistance states are observed as the magnetization breaks into domains\nand superconductivity nucleates underneath the domain walls where the Cooper pairs\nexperience weaker exchange field [19]. While the present results for \u03b8 < 90 might a priori be\nunderstood within this picture, the behavior for \u03b8 = 90 (Figs. 1 (a) and 2 (d)) rules out this\npossibility. Contrary to what is expected in the exchange field scenario [19], here the lowest\nresistance state is observed when the Co/Pt multilayer is homogenously magnetized (under\nthe application of a ~4 kOe in-plane field), and the presence of magnetic domains leads to a\nresistance increase (see curve for \u03b8 = 90 ). We argue below that the hysteretic magnetotransport observed in the present experiments is caused by the stray magnetic fields from the\nCo/Pt multilayer's magnetic domains. We show that this mechanism allows us to understand\nthe observed behavior in the entire experimentally probed range of field angles. We consider\nonly the perpendicular component of the stray field: the large anisotropy and the nearly\nconstant background magneto-resistance for H in-plane (see \u03b8 =90o in Fig. 1 (b)) imply that\nthe effects of parallel magnetic fields are negligible as compared to those of perpendicular\nones, as expected for thin YBCO films [29].\nWe first explain the very different zero-field remanent resistances measured after\ndifferent magnetic preparations. We find that the presence of flux quanta (vortices) induced by\nthe corresponding magnetic domain structures accounts for the observed behavior. In Figs. 4\n\n9\n\n\f(a), (b) and (c) we respectively show room-temperature MFM images of the remanent domain\nstructures following I) the application and withdrawal of a saturating field at \u03b8 =90o, II)\ndemagnetization of the F [27] at \u03b8 =90o and III) demagnetization of the F at \u03b8 =0o. A mazelike structure of up/down magnetized domains is observed in all cases, but the domain widths\nare significantly different for each of them. The corresponding stray field profiles H S (x )\n(displayed in Figs. 4 (d), (e) and (f) respectively) were numerically calculated from the\ndigitized MFM images [30]. As the average domain width w increases (~250, ~330 nm and\n~660 nm for states I, III and III), the spatially averaged magnitude of the stray field\n\nHS\n\ndecreases (~230, ~210, and ~150 Oe respectively). Note that H S ~ 0 when the multilayer is\nfully magnetized perpendicular to the film plane ( M \u22a5 ~ M S , as occurs after applying and then\nremoving a saturating H with 0 \u2264 \u03b8 <80o). For states I, II, and III H S (x ) oscillates from\npositive to negative, mimicking the structure of magnetic domains. As expected from theory\n[31,32] this will induce vortices and antivortices (vortices of opposite polarity) in the YBCO\nfilm. However, due to flux quantization, the creation of vortices by the stray field will depend\non the stray field magnitude and the characteristic magnetic domain size. In order to\nquantify this, and to accordingly characterize the domain structures in the different magnetic\nstates, we use the parameter \u03c6 \u03c60 \u2261 \u03c0 H S\n\nw\n\n2\n\n4\u03c60 (with \u03c60 =2.07 10-15 Wb the flux\n\nquantum). As defined, \u03c6 \u03c60 is the number of flux quanta induced by the average stray field\nwithin a circular area of diameter w underneath a magnetic domain [e.g. the (blue) circle in\nFig. 4 (c)]. The definition of \u03c6 \u03c60 is motivated by the fact that domains have irregular,\nsomewhat elongated shapes [Fig. 4 (a)-(c)]: considering that vortices are naturally isotropic in\nthe film plane, one expects them to be formed under regular areas through which the net\nmagnetic flux exceeds the flux quantum, and not underneath too narrow domains (regardless\n\n10\n\n\fof their length). Experimentally, we find [Fig. 4 (g)] that the (temperature-dependent) zerofield resistances measured for the different magnetic states scale with \u03c6 \u03c60 . This can be\ninterpreted as follows. \u03c6 = 0 corresponds to the state in which M \u22a5 M S ~1 and the stray field\nis essentially zero. In this case, essentially no vortices/antivortices are induced by the\nferromagnet in the YBCO film and, consequently, the lowest zero-field resistance is observed.\nFor the states I-III, the resistance increases as average domain width and \u03c6 \u03c60 do, because an\nincreasing number of vortices/antivortices are induced by the stray field. Although these are\nlocalized underneath up/down magnetized domains, electrical resistance arises due to\nchanneling of the vortices along the stripe-like domains parallel to the Lorentz force [33],\nthermal fluctuations, and vortex-loop excitations induced by the current [34]. \u03c6 \u03c60 <<1\nindicates that many of the magnetic domains are too narrow to create a single vortex, so that\nvortices/antivortices are induced only by a fraction of them (larger than average). As \u03c6 \u03c60\nincreases, more vortices are induced, which yields a higher resistance. For the state III, in\nwhich the magnetic domains are the largest, \u03c6 \u03c60 >>1 and we expect stray-field induced\nvortices/antivortices underneath a majority of the domains. Note that the resistance\ndependence on \u03c6 \u03c60 tends to saturate above \u03c6 \u03c60 =1. This is consistent with the above\ndescription: once all of the magnetic domains are large enough to create at least one single\nvortex ( \u03c6 \u03c60 >1), further increase of their size will not result in a larger density of\nvortices/antivortices across the film, and therefore no significant resistance increase is\nexpected.\nFrom the above, we can understand R(H ) for \u03b8 =90o. The in-plane H has little effect on\nthe YBCO thin film, but it changes the magnetic structure of the Co/Pt multilayer as it is\ncycled, indirectly producing the behaviors of Fig. 1 and 2. When H is decreased to zero,\nR DEC (H ) gradually increases as the multilayer breaks into domains, the magnetization rotates\n\n11\n\n\fup/down out-of-plane, and vortices/antivortices are induced in the YBCO film. The maximum\nresistance is observed around H ~ 0.5 kOe, when the out of plane field component is at its\nmaximum, and therefore H S\n\nand the number of vortices/antivortices are maximum. Further\n\ndecrease of H leads to a gradual decrease of the resistance, as the magnetization again\nbecomes uniform (thereby diminishing the stray field) and rotates back in-plane. The same\ndescription applies to R INC (H ) as field is swept from negative to positive. A higher resistance\nis exhibited by RVIR (H ) (blue circles in Fig 2), because the larger domains obtained after\ndemagnetization produce more flux quanta [compare Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)].\nTo explain the behavior for \u03b8 <90o, we must also consider the vortices induced by the\nexternal field H . When the latter is sufficiently intense, vortices induced by H outnumber the\nvortices/antivortices induced by the stray field, and become dominant. In this situation the\nstructure of up/down magnetized domains produces magnetic pinning of vortices, as recently\nfound in Nb/Co-Pt multilayers [34]. We argue that this mechanism allows to explain why dips\nin \u0394R ( H ) are observed [Figs. 2 (a)-(c)]. At low H and in the presence of the maze-like\ndomain structure (see e.g. RVIR ( H ) , Fig 1 (a)), vortices/antivortices induce dissipation in the\nway described above. As H is increased, it suppresses the antivortices under the magnetic\ndomains having opposite polarity to it, and adds extra vortices. As theoretically shown [36]\nand experimentally observed in low- TC systems [37], the latter will be attracted to (repelled\nfrom) magnetic domains having the same (opposite) polarity, because this reduces the\nsystem's magnetostatic energy by a factor U m ~ \u03c60 H S . This results in an enhancement of\nvortex pinning (and consequently in a resistance decrease) as compared to the case in which\nthe multilayer's magnetization is uniform (and H S ~ 0 ), which produces the dips of \u0394R(H )\n[Figs. 2 (a)-(c)]. The maximum critical current enhancement \u0394J C ~ 2 kA cm-2 (see inset in\nFigure 3 (b)) is notably smaller than \u0394J C ~ 103 kA cm-2 estimated by equating the magnetic\n\n12\n\n\fpinning force U m w to the Lorentz force J\u03c60 [36]. One may argue that this disagreement\narises from a modified w in the superconducting state. However, in order to account for this\ndiscrepancy, the domains would need to be around two orders of magnitude larger in the\nsuperconducting state than at room temperature. More probably, that disagreement arises from\nthe incommensurability between the vortex-lattice and the domain structure in the field range\nwhere dissipation is dominated by\n\nH . The expected distance between vortices\n\nd ~ (\u03c60 H cos(\u03b8 )) ~ 250 nm is smaller than average distance ~2 w between \"pinning\"\n12\n\ndomains (those having the same polarity as vortices). Therefore, matching of the vortexlattice to the domains structure implies a large cost of elastic energy, and strongly reduces the\navailable net magnetic pinning energy per vortex. In addition, the average domain size\nw ~0.5-0.6 \u03bcm is comparable but shorter than the estimated effective penetration depth\n\n\u039b ab = \u03bb2 ab t ~ 1.15\n\n\u03bcm (we used the bulk YBCO \u03bb ab = 150 and t =20 nm is the film\n\nthickness), from which one could actually expect U m to be sensibly smaller than\n~ \u03c60 H S .\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the stray magnetic fields from a ferromagnet can\nstrongly modify the mixed-state magneto-transport of a High-TC superconductor. We found a\nmagnetic-history-controlled negative/positive resistance switching, reminiscent of the\nstandard/inverse \"spin switch effects\" [10-20], which is produced here by vortex dynamics\nand pinning effects. Our results shows that, in order to optimize magnetic pinning in highTC's, the F domain structure sizes must be chosen in order to limit the drawback of the\ndissipation caused by the wandering of the vortices/antivortices induced by the stray field.\nThis work was supported by the French RTRA \"Supraspin\" and ANR\n\"SUPERHYBRIDS-II\" grants.\n\n13\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] A.
