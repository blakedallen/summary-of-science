A census of its stellar population\ncurrently stands at 18 systems, covering spectral types B8\u2013M5.5.\nAt high and intermediate masses the cluster Initial Mass Function\n(IMF) follows that of other star-forming regions and young stellar\ngroups, but there is a clear deficit of members at masses <0.15 M\u2299 .\nComparing the observed mass function of the cluster to the Orion\nTrapezeium Cluster, Lyo et al. (2004) predict that an additional 20\nstars and brown dwarfs in the mass range 0.025 < M < 0.15\nM\u2299 remain to be discovered. Efforts to observe this hitherto unseen population have failed to find any additional members at either larger radii from the cluster core (Luhman 2004, to 1.5 deg,\n4 times the radius of known membership) or to low masses in the\ncluster core (Lyo et al. 2006, to \u223c13 MJup ). Failure to find these\nlow\u2013mass members raises a fundamental question: has the cluster's\nevolution been driven by dynamical interactions which dispersed\nthe stars into a diffuse halo at even larger radii, or does \u03b7 Cha\npossess an abnormally top-heavy IMF deficient in low\u2013mass objects? The latter result would seemingly be at odds with the growing body of evidence that suggests the IMF is universal and independent of initial star-forming conditions (for a detailed review see\nBastian, Covey & Meyer 2010).\nMoraux, Lawson & Clarke (2007) have attempted to model\nthe observed properties of \u03b7 Cha using N -body simulations of the\ncluster's dynamical evolution starting with standard initial conditions. They are able to replicate the current configuration of the\n\n\u22c6\n\nEmail: murphysj@mso.anu.edu.au (SJM);\n(WAL); bessell@mso.anu.edu.au (MSB)\n\ncluster assuming a log-normal IMF and 30\u201370 initial members.\nThis suggests the deficit of low\u2013mass objects seen in the present\nday cluster may not be due to a peculiar IMF but to dynamical evolution. Their simulations predict there should exist a diffuse halo\nof cluster ejectees beyond the radius currently surveyed. Such comoving objects will have similar proper motions and distances as\nthe cluster proper. In this letter we present the results of our search\nfor this putative halo of low\u2013mass stars surrounding \u03b7 Cha.\n\n2 CANDIDATE SELECTION\n2.1 Photometry\nUsing the T OPCAT 1 Virtual Observatory tool we crossmatched DENIS and 2MASS survey photometry within a 5.5 deg radius surrounding \u03b7 Cha. Candidates were selected by forming the iDENIS\nversus (i \u2212 J2MASS ) colour-magniude diagram for the 1.2 \u00d7 106\nsources in the field. As seen in Figure 1 the empirical cluster\nisochrone is well defined in this diagram through the K and M spectral types. Due to its youth, proximity to Earth and lack of any substantial reddening, the cluster isochrone sits well above the vast majority of stars in the field. To account for unresolved binarity, reddening, distance variations and any non-linearities in the isochrone\nwe initially selected photometric candidates lying \u00b11.5 mag from\na linear fit to all known late-type members. Because we are interested in the low\u2013mass population we restricted our candidates to\n(i \u2212 J) > 1.5, corresponding to spectral types \u223cM3 and later,\nand (J \u2212 H)2MASS < 0.8, to minimize contamination from background giants. Excluding stars with poor 2MASS photometry (14),\n\nw.lawson@adfa.edu.au\n1\n\nAvailable for download at http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/\n\n\f2\n\nS. J. Murphy, W. A. Lawson and M. S. Bessell\n\nFigure 1. DENIS/2MASS colour\u2013magnitude diagram for a 5.5 deg radius around \u03b7 Cha. Contours show the cumulative totals of stars enclosed.\nWe select candidates (filled circles) \u00b11.5 mag from the empirical cluster\nisochrone (solid line) also having (i \u2212 J) > 1.5. Known KM-type members are shown as filled stars. Proper motion candidates are denoted by open\ncircles. The intermediate\u2013gravity stars described in \u00a73.3 are labelled.\n\ntain proper motion measurements explicitly set to zero (D. Monet,\nprivate communication). All 18 \u03b7 Cha members were found in NOMAD, 14 of which have non\u2013zero proper motions. The four outstanding members are located close to bright stars or diffraction\nspikes, making proper motion measurements difficult.\nFor a given U V W space motion the resultant proper motion vector (and radial velocity) depends on both sky position\nand distance. Given the large angular extent of the survey area,\nthis can have a substantial effect on the expected proper motions\nand radial velocities of our candidates. Using the canonical cluster space motion, (U, V, W ) = (\u221211.8, \u221219.1, \u221210.5) km s\u22121\n(Mamajek et al. 2000) we calculated the expected proper motion\nof each candidate. From the uncertainties in the NOMAD proper\nmotions we then calculated the number of sigma from the expected\nproper motion in each component. We selected as proper motion\ncandidates the 14 stars that lay within \u00b13\u03c3 of the mean of the cluster stars. All 14 known members fell within the 3\u03c3 selection box.\n\n3 FOLLOW\u2013UP SPECTROSCOPY\n3.1 Low\u2013resolution spectroscopy\nWe obtained low\u2013resolution spectra of our proper motion candidates and a selection of photometric candidates using the Double\nBeam Spectrograph (DBS) on the ANU 2.3 m telescope at Siding\nSpring Observatory during 2009 March. With the 316 lines mm\u22121\nred grating our spectra cover the wavelength range 5920\u20139750 \u00c5 at\na resolution of 5 \u00c5 (1.9 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 ). On each night we also observed\nflux standards, smooth spectrum stars for telluric correction and a\nselection of Gliese dwarf standards from Lyo et al. (2004, 2008)\nfor spectral typing and gravity estimation. Of the 14 proper motion\ncandidates, 11 were observed in this mode. The remaining three are\nfaint and two have DENIS i magnitudes that fall more than 1 mag\nbelow the cluster isochrone and are not considered likely members. We also observed 18 additional photometric candidates that\nlay close to the cluster isochrone and had null proper motions, or a\nproper motion just outside the 3\u03c3 selection box.\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of candidates on the sky. Symbols are as for Figure 1.\nThe area enclosed by the dotted line is that searched by Luhman (2004),\nthe dashed line is the 5.5 deg radius of this study. Contours correspond to\n10 MJy sr\u22121 IRAS 100 \u03bcm flux.\n\nknown members (5) and previously confirmed field stars (3) left\n81 photometric candidates. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the\ncandidates on the sky. Just one candidate lies within 1.5 deg of the\ncluster, the radius to which Luhman (2004) searched using a different method and reported no new members.\n2.2 Proper Motions\nKinematics have been vital in confirming membership of the numerous young stellar associations in the Solar neighborhood. In\nthe absence of radial velocities and accurate distances however,\nproper motions are the sole means of investigating the kinematics\nof our stars. We therefore cross matched the 81 candidates against\nthe Naval Observatory Merged Astrometric Catalogue (NOMAD).\nOnly one of the photometric candidates was not found in NOMAD,\nthis is the second faintest star in the sample. Eighteen candidates\nreturned a null proper motion. These correspond to highly uncer-\n\n3.2 Spectral types\nTo garner spectral types we first performed synthetic photometry\non the flux-calibrated DBS spectra to calculate broadband (R \u2212 I)\ncolours. Unfortunately, the Gliese standards we intended to use to\ncalibrate the colour transformations are much brighter than the candidates and suffer from severe fringing at wavelengths greater than\n\u223c8000 \u00c5, probably as a result of scattered light inside the spectrograph. Using the Gliese dwarfs to calibrate the candidate photometry results in a systematic 0.05\u20130.15 mag over-estimation of\n(R \u2212 I) for the known \u03b7 Cha members. We therefore calibrated\nthe photometry of the Gliese dwarfs and candidates separately. The\ninstrumental (R \u2212 I) colours of the two groups were transformed\nonto the Cousins system using published photometry for the Gliese\ndwarfs (Bessell 1990) and the 14 late\u2013type members of \u03b7 Cha from\nLyo et al. (2004, 2008), respectively. In both cases the transformation was well-fitted by a low-order polynomial. The Lyo et al.\n\u03b7 Cha colours are calibrated using the same Gliese dwarfs and\nBessell (1990) colours we used, so the two calibrations are equivalent.\nSpectral types of the candidates were finally obtained by converting the (R \u2212 I) colour to a spectral type using the M-dwarf\ntransformation of Bessell (1991). Lyo et al. (2004, 2008) have\n\n\fFirst detection of a low-mass stellar halo around \u03b7 Cha\n\n3\n\nshown that the (R \u2212 I) colours (and various narrowband spectral\nindices) of intermediate\u2013age pre-main sequence (PMS) stars are\nindistinguishable from Gyr-old field dwarfs and that they closely\nfollow a dwarf temperature (spectral type) sequence. The (R \u2212 I)\nderived spectral types of the Gliese M-dwarfs and known \u03b7 Cha\nmembers agree with published values at the 0.1\u20130.2 subtype level.\nNo attempt has been made to correct the photometry for the effects\nof reddening \u2013 we assume it to be minimal at these distances. The\nmaximum reddening from dust maps is E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.5 mag, although the majority of this material is probably background to the\ncandidates. We estimate 0.1 mag as a more likely upper limit. To\ninclude the effects of unknown reddening we adopt 0.5 subtypes as\nthe uncertainty on our spectral type measurements.\n3.3 Gravity estimation and H\u03b1 emission\nPre\u2013main sequence stars are in the process of contraction to their\neventual main sequence radii. As a result they have slightly lower\nsurface gravities than their main sequence counterparts (but still\nmuch closer to dwarfs than giants). The neutral alkali metal lines in\nour spectra, such as the K I (7665/7699 \u00c5) and Na I (8183/8195 \u00c5)\ndoublets, are highly sensitive to gravity. Later than mid-M spectral types there is a marked difference in Na I absorption between\nM\u2013dwarfs, PMS stars and M\u2013giants. Many authors have used the\nstrength of the Na I doublet to gauge the surface gravities of late\u2013\ntype PMS candidates and assign coarse age rankings (e.g. Lyo et al.\n2004, 2008; Lawson et al. 2009). We adopt the spectral index defined by Slesnick et al. (2006) to measure the strength of Na I absorption. It is formed by integrating the spectrum in two 30 \u00c5\nbands, one on the doublet, the other sampling the adjacent pseudocontinuum. Figure 3 shows the Na I index versus (R \u2212 I) colour\nfor our DBS targets, known \u03b7 Cha members, the Gliese field dwarfs\nand KM giants from the Pickles library. At spectral types later than\nM3 the locus of \u03b7 Cha members clearly diverges from the dwarf\nsequence and assumes an intermediate gravity between dwarfs and\ngiants. Several candidates occupy the same region of the diagram \u2013\nthese 6 stars are likely PMS stars of ages 5\u201310 Myr.\nAll of the intermediate-gravity stars exhibit H\u03b1 emission, as\ndo all the late\u2013type members of \u03b7 Cha. This is a necessary, but insufficient indicator of youth because of the potential contamination\nfrom older, flaring M-dwarfs. When combined with gravity information however it is a powerful discriminant. The six intermediate\u2013\ngravity stars and their particulars are presented in Table 1\n3.4 Medium\u2013resolution spectroscopy\nTo derive radial velocities and check for the presence of lithium absorption at 6708 \u00c5, we obtained medium\u2013resolution (R \u2243 7000)\nspectra of the stars in Table 1 with the WiFeS instrument at the\nANU 2.3 m during 2010 January\u2013April. We also observed many of\nthe other candidates with congruent photometry, proper motions or\nH\u03b1 emission. WiFeS (Dopita et al. 2007) is a double\u2013beam, image\u2013\nslicing integral field spectrograph, and provides a 25\u00d738 arcsec\nfield with 0.5\u2032\u2032 pixels. The red R7000 grating provides wavelength\ncoverage from 5300\u20137060 \u00c5, at a resolution of 1 \u00c5 (0.44 \u00c5 px\u22121 ).\nFor deriving radial velocities, we took NeAr arc frames immediately after each exposure and also observed 5\u20137 mid-M radial velocity standards each night. Only the 6 intermediate\u2013gravity stars\nin Table 1 were found to have lithium in their spectra. To obtain a\nradial velocity each spectrum was cross-correlated against all the\nstandards from that night over the region 6000\u20136500 \u00c5, and the velocity taken as the mean of those measurements (after correcting to\n\nFigure 3. Gravity\u2013temperature diagram for our DBS targets. Thin lines are\nfits to the observed K and M\u2013type dwarfs (squares) and Pickles giants (triangles). The thick line is a fit to the late\u2013type cluster members (filled stars).\nCandidates with H\u03b1 emission are given by filled circles, those without are\ncrosses. Proper motion candidates are denoted by open circles.\n\na heliocentric frame). Stars were observed on multiple nights and\nwe took the velocity as the mean of these values. Multiple measurements and cross-correlations between standards show we are easily\nable to attain a radial velocity precision of 2 km s\u22121 from the instrument. Li I and H\u03b1 equivalent widths and the radial velocities\nderived from the WiFeS spectra are given in Table 1.\n\n4 CLUSTER MEMBERSHIP\n4.1 Lithium equivalent widths\nLithium is very easily destroyed in stellar atmospheres, hence the\ndetection of lithium absorption in a low\u2013mass star is a strong indicator of youth. The equivalent width of the Li I 6708 \u00c5 feature\nis highly dependent on both age and temperature. Mentuch et al.\n(2008) present the distribution of Li I EWs for a variety of nearby\nstellar associations. For the spectral types under consideration here\nall but one of the measured Li I EWs in Table 1 are consistent with\nan 8\u201310 Myr population like \u03b7 Cha. Based on its smaller Li I equivalent width and poor CMD placement we are able to immediately\nrule out 2MASS 0942\u20137727 as an \u03b7 Cha member.\n4.2 Other young stars in the region\nThe region surrounding \u03b7 Cha is rich in pre-main sequence stars of\nvarious ages. Covino et al. (1997) present radial velocities, spectral\ntypes and lithium equivalent widths from high-resolution spectra of\nROSAT detections in the region. Four of their stars lie in the eastern\nhalf of our survey area and have spectral types and lithium equivalent widths similar to the late-type population of \u03b7 Cha. These\nare shown in Table 1 with measurements derived from WiFeS spectra. Spectral types are from Covino et al. (1997). Such an X-ray\nselected sample is probably incomplete, as the ROSAT flux limit\nfor a \u223c10 Myr PMS star at the cluster distance is around M2.\n4.3 Dynamics\nIf the remaining candidates are in fact ejected members of \u03b7 Cha\nwe do not expect their space motions to be identical to that of the\n\n\f4\n\nS.

The results of dynamical simulations for the 5 Li-rich members and 4 PMS stars from Covino et al. (1997). The colour scale indicates the difference\nbetween the observed and expected space motion at that distance. The dashed line denotes the revised 94.3 pc cluster distance from van Leeuwen (2007).\n\ncluster proper. They will have each been imparted some ejection\nvelocity which acts over time to disperse the star away from the\ncluster core. To determine the possible epoch and magnitude of this\nimpulse we modeled the space motion of the candidates as a function of ejection time and current distance, between \u221210 and 0 Myr,\nand 50 < d < 150 pc. Figure 4 shows the results of such simulations. At each ejection time the cluster was first linearly backtraced\nto its heliocentric position at that epoch. For each distance we then\ncalculate the current Galactic location of the candidate and the corresponding U V W required to move it there since ejection. This\nis compared to the observed U V W derived from proper motion\nand radial velocity measurements. The colour-map in Figure 4 indicates the vector magnitude of the difference between the two space\nmotions. Empty regions in the diagrams have velocity differences\nlarger than those expected from the error in space motion at that distance. A similar map can be made for ejection speed. In these simulations we use the new cluster distance of 94.3 pc and proper motion vector from the revised Hipparcos astrometry of van Leeuwen\n(2007) and the improved radial velocity, VR = 18.3 \u00b1 0.1 km s\u22121\n(A. Brandeker, private communication). Proper motions from the\n\nPPMXL catalogue (Roeser et al. 2010) are also now available. We\nuse these here and in Table 1 in preference to the original NOMAD\nvalues. Although they quote larger errors than NOMAD, PPMXL\nis better able to replicate the mean proper motion of known \u03b7 Cha\nmembers. As a check we have repeated the proper motion anaysis\nof \u00a72.2 using the PPMXL values and find no change in the final\ncandidate list.\n\nThe kinematic distances estimated from Figure 4 can be\nchecked against those expected from a star's position in the cluster CMD. Such a diagram is shown in Figure 5, where we separate\nthe cluster members into single (or high mass-ratio binary) stars\nand binary systems. Equal mass binaries should lie 0.75 mag above\nthe single star locus, corresponding to the dashed line. There is excellent overall agreement between the kinematic and photometric\ndistances of the candidates. From comparison of Figures 4 and 5\nwe propose 4 probable and 3 possible new \u03b7 Cha members.\n\n\fFirst detection of a low-mass stellar halo around \u03b7 Cha\n\n5\n\nRX J1005.3. Figure 5 suggests a distance slightly in front of\nthe cluster, but the best fitting kinematic distance is 95 pc, corresponding to an ejection of 4\u20135 km s\u22121 1.5 Myr ago. It lies at the\nedge of the 100 \u03bcm IRAS flux in Figure 2 so it is possible that the\nstar may be reddened slightly (see the arrow in Figure 5).\n\n4.6 Non-members\n\nFigure 5. The late-type \u03b7 Cha cluster sequence, for single (gray stars, solid\nfitted line) and known binaries (filled stars, dashed line). The arrow indicates a reddening of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.1 mag in this colour-magnitude plane.\nThe vertical line is the blue limit of our photometric/proper motion survey.\n\nRX J0915.5. The dynamical simulation for this star suggests a distance of 110 pc, whereas its position in Figure 5 indicates it should\nlie at a similar distance to the cluster, some 15 pc closer.\nRX J0942.7. Not a likely \u03b7 Cha member due to its position a\nmagnitude below the cluster isochrone and lower lithium equivalent\nwidth. Even at the 120 pc given by the simulations it still lies 0.5\nmag below the single-star isochrone. It may be a member of the\nolder, more distant Lower-Centaurus-Crux OB association.\n\n4.4 Probable members\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\n\n2MASS 0820\u20138003. This candidate is a highly probable member\nbased on its observed space motion. It also has the closest angular\nseparation from the cluster core of any candidate (1.44 deg). The\nresults of the simulations show that it need only be ejected from the\ncluster at 1\u20132 km s\u22121 in the last 4 Myr ago to move to its present location. Multiple WiFeS observations show the star possesses strong\nand highly variable H\u03b1 emission.\n2MASS 0905\u20138134. this star shows excellent agreement between its kinematic distance of \u223c86 pc and slightly elevated position above the \u03b7 Cha CMD. The simulations suggest the star was\nejected from the cluster 6.25 Myr ago at a speed of 1.5 km s\u22121 .\n2MASS 0913\u20137550. also shows excellent agreement between\nkinematic and photometric distances. The star was ejected 3.5 Myr\nago at a speed of 6 km s\u22121 and currently lies in front of the cluster\nat a distance of 73 pc. Stellar encounters would be so rare and weak\nat this epoch that the only possible mechanism for such dynamic is\nfrom the break-up of an unstable multiple system, perhaps one of\nthe currently seen binaries in the cluster.\nRX J0902.9. This M3 star from Covino et al. (1997) lies just\noutside the 1.5 deg surveyed by Luhman (2004). It has a kinematic\ndistance of \u223c85 pc and would have been ejected at 1\u20132 km s\u22121\nearly in the cluster's dynamical evolution.\n\nWe have discovered several new probable members of \u03b7 Cha up to\n5 deg from the cluster core and several possible members awaiting further confirmation. Are these findings consistent with a dynamical origin for the paucity of low-mass objects observed in the\ncluster?\nTo answer this we consider the radial distribution of ejectees\npresented in Moraux et al. (2007). Integrating the distribution out to\n9 pc (5.5 deg) we could expect to find up to 6 stars across all masses\nin the survey area. Our blue photometry limit of i \u2212 J > 1.5 corresponds to an approximate spectral type of M3, whereas our spectroscopic campaign is complete to i \u2212 J < 2, approximately M5.\nTransforming these spectral types to temperatures using the relation\nof Bessell (1991) and then to masses from an 8 Myr Baraffe et al.\n(1998) isochrone gives an approximate surveyed mass range of\n0.08 < M < 0.3 M\u2299 . Moraux et al. find the mass distribution\nof ejectees is roughly constant with radius and consistent with the\nChabrier (2003) input IMF. We therefore integrate this IMF over\nthe above mass range to find the fraction of stars at those masses,\nthis is \u223c40%. Hence we can expect to find 2\u20133 bona fide \u03b7 Cha\nmembers within the surveyed area and mass range. Our discovery of 3 probable 2MASS/DENIS members is consistent with this\nprediction. We can therefore conclude that dynamical evolution is\nsolely responsible for the current configuration of \u03b7 Cha and it is\nnot necessary to invoke an IMF deficient in low\u2013mass objects.\n\n4.5 Possible members\n2MASS 0801\u20138058. This star is a probable close binary, based on\nits location in Figure 5 and 8 velocity measurements during 2010\nJanuary\u2013April. The velocity given in Table 1 is the mean of these\nmeasurements, and should be close to the systemic velocity. The\ndynamical simulations suggest it was ejected from the cluster at a\nspeed of <2 km s\u22121 early in the cluster's evolution. Even taking\ninto account the apparent binarity, its position in Figure 5 is more\nconsistent with a distance at or slightly behind the cluster, rather\nthan the 85 pc given by Figure 5.\n2MASS 0955\u20137622. Also a possible binary, from its elevated\nposition in Figure 5 and low velocity. However, ten RV measurements between 2010 January\u2013April do not show any significant\nvariation outside instrument errors. If the simulations are correct,\nit would have been ejected from the cluster at over 10 km s\u22121 very\nlate in the cluster's history. Even so, its current distance would still\nnot be close enough to match its position in Figure 5.\n\nREFERENCES\nBaraffe I., Chabrier G., Allard F., Hauschildt P.
