INTRODUCTION\n\nThe problem of the accelerating universe, the cosmological constant and the vacuum\nenergy associated with it is of extremely high interest these days. There are many questions related to these problems, especially with respect to the cosmological constant at the\nquantum level, all of which are related to quantum gravity. For example, why there exists\nthe critical mass density and why the cosmological constant has this or that value? Trying\nto answer these questions and others were recently the subject of many publications [1-18].\nMost of the calculations done to obtain the value of the cosmological constant \u039b use methods of quantum gravity. But there is no such a theory as yet and hence a variety of results\nfor \u039b are obtained. The numerical value of \u039b is subsequently supposed to be inserted in\nthe Einstein field equations, thus determining the evolution of the universe and the vacuum\nenergy associated with it.\nIn this paper we present a fundamentally different approach in which the cosmological\nconstant is not included a preiori in the theory, but \u039b can be extracted from the theory\nwithout the use of any quantum gravity theory. The value of \u039b will emerge from the gravitational field equations. Our theory employs a Riemannian four-dimensional presentation\nof gravity in which the coordinates are those of Hubble, namely distances and (cosmological) velocity instead of the traditional space and time. The gravitational field equations\nso constracted are subsequently solved and different kinds of expansion are obtained. It is\nshown that the accelerating universe is the only acceptable possibility. We then extract the\nvalue of \u039b from the theory and show that it is given by \u039b = 2.036 \u00d7 10\u221235 s\u22122 , which is\nin excellent agreement with the recently obtained measurements by the High-Z Supernova\nTeam and the Supernova Cosmology Project [19-25]. Furthermore we determine the kind\nof the three-dimensional spatial subspace of the four-dimensional curved space to be flat,\nwhich is in agreement with the recent Boomerang experiment [26,27].\nIn Section 2 a brief review of previous work is given. Section 3 is devoted to the accelerated universe, whereas in Section 4 it is shown how the Tolman metric can be considered\n2\n\n\fas an expanding universe. In Section 5 the value of the cosmological constant is calculated,\nand the spatial three-dimensional subspace is determined to be flat. Section 6 is devoted to\nthe concluding remarks.\n\nII. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS WORK\n\nAs in classical general relativity we start our discussion in flat space which will then be\ngeneralized to curved space.\nThe Flat Space Case. The flat-space cosmological metric is given by\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nds2 = \u03c4 2 dv 2 \u2212 dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere \u03c4 is Hubble's time, the inverse of Hubble's constant, as given by Freedman's measurements in the limit of zero distances and thus zero gravity [28,29]. As such, \u03c4 is a constant,\nin fact a universal constant (its numerical value is given in Section 5). Its role in cosmology\ntheory resembles that of c, the speed of light in vacuum, in ordinary special relativity. The\nvelocity v is used here in the sense of cosmology, as in Hubble's law, and is usually not the\ntime-derivative of the distance.\nThe universe expansion is obtained from the metric (2.1) as a null condition, ds = 0.\nUsing spherical coordinates r, \u03b8, \u03c6 for the metric (2.1), and the fact that the universe is\nspherically symmetric (d\u03b8 = d\u03c6 = 0), the null condition then yields dr/dv = \u03c4 , or upon\nintegration and using appropriate initial conditions, gives r = \u03c4 v or v = H0 r, i.e. the Hubble\nlaw in the zero-gravity limit.\nBased on the metric (2.1) a cosmological special relativity (CSR) was developed [3036] (for applications to inflation in the universe see Refs. [37-39]). In this theory the\nreceding velocities of galaxies and the distances between them in the Hubble expansion are\nunited into a four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean manifold, similarly to space and time in\nordinary special relativity. The Hubble law is assumed and is written in an invariant way\nthat enables one to derive a four-dimensional transformation which is similar to the Lorentz\n3\n\n\ftransformation. The parameter in the new transformation is the ratio between the cosmic\ntime to \u03c4 (in which the cosmic time is measured backward with respect to the present time).\nAccordingly, the new transformation relates physical quantities at different cosmic times in\nthe limit of weak or negligible gravitation.\nThe transformation between the four variables x, y, z, v and x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 , v \u2032 (assuming\ny \u2032 = y and z \u2032 = z) is given by\nx \u2212 tv\nx\u2032 = q\n,\n1 \u2212 t2 /\u03c4 2\n\nv \u2212 tx/\u03c4 2\nv\u2032 = q\n,\n1 \u2212 t2 /\u03c4 2\n\ny \u2032 = y, z \u2032 = z.\n\n(2.2)\n\nEquations (2.2) are the cosmological transformation and very much resemble the well-known\nLorentz transformation. In CSR it is the relative cosmic time which takes the role of the\nrelative velocity in Einstein's special relativity. The transformation (2.2) leaves invariant\nthe Hubble time \u03c4 , just as the Lorentz transformation leaves invariant the speed of light in\nvacuum c.\nGeneralization to Curved Space. A cosmological general theory of relativity, suitable\nfor the large-scale structure of the universe, was subsequently developed [40-43]. In the\nframework of cosmological general relativity (CGR) gravitation is described by a curved\nfour-dimensional Riemannian spacevelocity. CGR incorporates the Hubble constant \u03c4 at\nthe outset. The Hubble law is assumed in CGR as a fundamental law. CGR, in essence,\nextends Hubble's law so as to incorporate gravitation in it; it is actually a distribution theory\nthat relates distances and velocities between galaxies. The theory involves only measured\nquantities and it takes a picture of the Universe as it is at any moment. The following is a\nbrief review of CGR as was originally given by the author in 1966 in Ref. 40.\nThe foundations of any gravitational theory are based on the principles of equivalence and\ngeneral covariance [44]. These two principles lead immediately to the realization that gravitation should be described by a four-dimensional curved spacetime, in our theory spacevelocity,\nand that the field equations and the equations of motion should be written in a generally\ncovariant form. Hence these principles were adopted in CGR also. Use is made in a fourdimensional Riemannian manifold with a metric g\u03bc\u03bd and a line element ds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd .\n4\n\n\fThe difference from Einstein's general relativity is that our coordinates are: x0 is a velocitylike coordinate (rather than a timelike coordinate), thus x0 = \u03c4 v where \u03c4 is the Hubble\ntime in the zero-gravity limit and v the velocity. The coordinate x0 = \u03c4 v is the comparable\nto x0 = ct where c is the speed of light and t is the time in ordinary general relativity. The\nother three coordinates xk , k = 1, 2, 3, are spacelike, just as in general relativity theory.\nAn immediate consequence of the above choice of coordinates is that the null condition\nds = 0 describes the expansion of the universe in the curved spacevelocity (generalized Hubble's law with gravitation) as compared to the propagation of light in the curved spacetime\nin general relativity. This means one solves the field equations (to be given in the sequel)\nfor the metric tensor, then from the null condition ds = 0 one obtains immedialety the\ndependence of the relative distances between the galaxies on their relative velocities.\nAs usual in gravitational theries, one equates geometry to physics.The first is expressed\nby means of a combination of the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar, and follows to be naturally\neither the Ricci trace-free tensor or the Einstein tensor. The Ricci trace-free tensor does not\nfit gravitation, and the Einstein tensor is a natural candidate. The physical part is expressed\nby the energy-momentum tensor which now has a different physical meaning from that in\nEinstein's theory. More important, the coupling constant that relates geometry to physics\nis now also different.\nAccordingly the field equations are\n1\nG\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R = \u03baT\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nexactly as in Einstein's theory, with \u03ba given by \u03ba = 8\u03c0k/\u03c4 4 , (in general relativity it is given\nby 8\u03c0G/c4 ), where k is given by k = G\u03c4 2 /c2 , with G being Newton's gravitational constant,\nand \u03c4 the Hubble constant time. When the equations of motion will be written in terms of\nvelocity instead of time, the constant k will replace G. Using the above equations one then\nhas \u03ba = 8\u03c0G/c2 \u03c4 2 .\nThe energy-momentum tensor T \u03bc\u03bd is constructed, along the lines of general relativity\ntheory, with the speed of light being replaced by the Hubble constant time. If \u03c1 is the\n5\n\n\faverage mass density of the universe, then it will be assumed that T \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1u\u03bc u\u03bd , where u\u03bc\nis the four-velocity. In general relativity theory one takes T00 = \u03c1. In Newtonian gravity\none has the Poisson equation \u22072 \u03c6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1. At points where \u03c1 = 0 one solves the vacuum\nEinstein field equations and the Laplace equation \u22072 \u03c6 = 0 in Newtonian gravity. In both\ntheories a null (zero) solution is allowed as a trivial case. In cosmology, however, there exists\nno situation at which \u03c1 can be zero because the universe is filled with matter. In order to\nbe able to have zero on the right-hand side of Eq. (2.3) one takes T00 not as equal to \u03c1, but\nto \u03c1ef f = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1c , where \u03c1c is the critical mass density, a constant given by \u03c1c = 3/8\u03c0G\u03c4 2 ,\nwhose value is \u03c1c \u2248 10\u221229 g/cm3 , a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. Accordingly one\ntakes\nT \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1ef f u\u03bc u\u03bd ; \u03c1ef f = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1c\n\n(2.4)\n\nfor the energy-momentum tensor.\nIn the next sections we apply CGR to obtain the accelerating expanding universe and\nrelated subjects.\n\nIII. THE ACCELERATING UNIVERSE\n\nIn previous works [40-43] it was shown that CGR predicts in a natural way that the\nuniverse is accelerating. In this section we show that result in still another way. To this\nend we solve the gravitational field equations (2.3) with an energy-momentum tensor that\nincludes pressure,\nT \u03bc\u03bd = [\u03c1ef f + p] u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 pg \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere p is the pressure The gravitational field that is sought is assumed to be both static\nand spherically symmetric and is therefore given by\n\u0010\n\nds2 = e\u03bd \u03c4 2 dv 2 \u2212 e\u03bb dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n\n\u0011\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u22121/2\nwith \u03bd, \u03bb being functions of r alone, and u0 = u\u22121\n; other components of u\u03b1 are\n0 = (g00 )\n\nzero. As has been described in the last section, the universe expansion is obtained by the\n6\n\n\fnull requirement, ds = 0. Since, moreover, the universe expands in a spherically symmetric\nway, one also has d\u03b8 = d\u03c6 = 0. As a result, Eq. (3.2) reduces to\ne\u03bd \u03c4 2 dv 2 \u2212 e\u03bb dr 2 = 0,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich yields for the universe expansion the very simple formula\ndr\n= \u03c4 e(\u03bd\u2212\u03bb)/2 .\ndv\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe nonvanishing components of the mixed Einstein tensor G\u03bd\u03bc gives the following for\nthe gravitational field equations:\nG00 = \u2212e\u2212\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\u2032\n1\n\u2212\nr2\nr\n\n!\n\n+\n\n1\n= \u03baT00 ,\nr2\n\n(3.5a)\n\n\u03bb\u0307\n= \u03baT01 ,\nr\n!\n\u03bd\u2032\n1\n1\n+ 2 + 2 = \u03baT11 ,\nr\nr\nr\n\nG10 = \u2212e\u2212\u03bb\nG11 = \u2212e\u2212\u03bb\n\n\u03bd \u20322 \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 \u03bd \u2032 \u03bb\u2032\n1\n+\n\u2212\nG22 = \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb \u03bd \u2032\u2032 +\n2\n2\nr\n2\n\n!\n\n1\n\u03bb\u03072 \u03bd\u0307 \u03bb\u0307\n+ e\u2212\u03bd \u03bb\u0308 +\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n\nG33 = G22 = \u03baT33 .\n\n(3.5b)\n(3.5c)\n!\n\n= \u03baT22 ,\n\n(3.5d)\n(3.5e)\n\nAll other components of the Einstein tensor vanish identically, a prime denotes differentiation\nwith respect to r, and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to v.\nThe above equations then yield\ne\n\n\u2212\u03bb\n\ne\n\u2212\u03bb\n\ne\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n= \u2212\u03ba\u03c1ef f ,\nr2\n\n(3.6)\n\n\u03bd\u2032\n1\n+\nr2\nr\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n= \u03bap,\nr2\n\n(3.7)\n\n1\n\u03bb\u2032\n\u2212\nr2\nr\n\n\u2212\u03bb\n\n!\n\n1\n\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 1 \u2032 \u2032\n\u03bd + \u03bd \u20322 +\n\u2212 \u03bd \u03bb = \u03bap.\n2\nr\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(3.8)\n\nThe conservation law \u2207\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd = 0 yields\n1\np\u2032 = \u2212 \u03bd \u2032 (p + \u03c1ef f ) .\n2\n7\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fEquation (3.9) is not independent of Eqs. (3.6)-(3.8) since it is a consequence of the contracted Bianchi identities. One therefore has three equations for the four unknown functions\n\u03bd, \u03bb, \u03c1, p. One assumes a functional dependence of \u03c1 on r, calculate \u03bd, \u03bb from this knowledge,\nand finally calculate p.\nThe solution of Eq.

We then obtain from Eqs.

Using now the standard notation \u03a9 = \u03c1/\u03c1c , we\nobtain\ndr\n(1 \u2212 \u03a9) r 2\n=\u03c4 1+\ndv\n4c2 \u03c4 2\n\"\n\n#\n\n(3.24)\n\nfor the equation of the expansion of the universe. Equation (3.24), except for the factor 4,\nis identical to Eq. (15) of Ref. 40 and Eq. (5.10) of Ref. 41.\nThe second term in the square bracket in the above equation represents the deviation\nfrom the standard Hubble law due to gravity. For without that term, Eq. (3.24) reduces to\ndr/dv = \u03c4 , thus r = \u03c4 v + const. The constant can be taken zero if one assumes, as usual,\n9\n\n\fthat at r = 0 the velocity should also vanish. Thus r = \u03c4 v, or v = H0 r (since H0 = 1/\u03c4 ).\nAccordingly, the equation of motion (3.24) describes the expansion of the universe when\n\u03a9 = 1, namely when \u03c1 = \u03c1c , the equation coincides with the standard Hubble law.\nThe equation of motion (3.24) can easily be integrated exactly by the substitions\nsin \u03c7 = (\u03a9 \u2212 1)1/2 r/2c\u03c4 ; \u03a9 > 1,\n\n(3.25a)\n\nsinh \u03c7 = (1 \u2212 \u03a9)1/2 r/2c\u03c4 ; \u03a9 < 1.\n\n(3.25b)\n\nOne then obtains, using Eqs. (3.24) and (3.25),\ndv = cd\u03c7/ (\u03a9 \u2212 1)1/2 cos \u03c7; \u03a9 > 1,\n\n(3.26a)\n\ndv = cd\u03c7/ (1 \u2212 \u03a9)1/2 cosh \u03c7; \u03a9 < 1.\n\n(3.26b)\n\nWe give below the exact solutions for the expansion of the universe for each of the case,\n\u03a9 > 1 and \u03a9 < 1. As will be seen, the case of \u03a9 = 1 can be obtained at the limit \u03a9 \u2192 1\nfrom both cases.\nThe case \u03a9 > 1. From Eq. (3.26a) we have\nZ\n\nZ\nc\nd\u03c7\ndv = \u221a\n,\n\u03a9 \u2212 1 cos \u03c7\n\n(3.27)\n\nd\u03c7\n1 + sin \u03c7\n.\n= ln\ncos \u03c7\ncos \u03c7\n\n(3.28)\n\n\u221a\nwhere sin \u03c7 = r/a, and a = c\u03c4 \u03a9 \u2212 1.

We obtain\n\u221a\nK = \u2212\u03c0c/2 1 \u2212 \u03a9,\n\n(3.35)\n\nand thus\nv=\u221a\n\n\u03c0\n2c\n.\narctan e\u03c7 \u2212\n4\n1\u2212\u03a9\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(3.36)\n\nA straightforward calculation then gives\n\uf8f1\n\n\uf8eb\n\nb\uf8f2\nr\nv=\n2 arctan \uf8ed +\n\u03c4\uf8f3\nb\n\ns\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8fc\n\nr2\n\u03c0\uf8fd\n1 + 2\uf8f8 \u2212\n.\nb\n2\uf8fe\n\n(3.37)\n\nAs for the case \u03a9 > 1 one finds that v \u2192 0 when r \u2192 0, and again, using L'Hospital lemma,\nr = \u03c4 v when b \u2192 0 (and thus \u03a9 \u2192 1).\nPhysical meaning. To see the physical meaning of these solutions, however, one does\nnot need the exact solutions. Rather, it is enough to write down the solutions in the lowest\napproximation in \u03c4 \u22121 . One obtains, by differentiating Eq. (3.24) with respect to v, for\n\u03a9 > 1,\nd2 r/dv 2 = \u2212kr; k = (\u03a9 \u2212 1) /c2 ,\n\n(3.38)\n\nv\nv\nr (v) = A sin \u03b1 + B cos \u03b1 ,\nc\nc\n\n(3.39)\n\nthe solution of which is\n\n11\n\n\fwhere \u03b12 = \u03a9 \u2212 1 and A and B are constants. The latter can be determined by the initial\ncondition r (0) = 0 = B and dr (0) /dv = \u03c4 = A\u03b1/c, thus\nc\u03c4\nv\nsin \u03b1 .\n\u03b1\nc\n\nr (v) =\n\n(3.40)\n\nThis is obviously a closed universe, and presents a decelerating expansion.\nFor \u03a9 < 1 we have\nd2 r/dv 2 = (1 \u2212 \u03a9) r/c2 ,\n\n(3.41)\n\nwhose solution, using the same initial conditions, is\nr (v) =\n\nv\nc\u03c4\nsinh \u03b2 ,\n\u03b2\nc\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere \u03b2 2 = 1 \u2212 \u03a9. This is now an open accelerating universe.\nFor \u03a9 = 1 we have, of course, r = \u03c4 v.\nWe finally determine which of the three cases of expansion is the one at present epoch\nof time. To this end we have to write the solutions (3.40) and (3.42) in ordinary Hubble's\nlaw form v = H0 r. Expanding Eqs. (3.40) and (3.42) into power series in v/c and keeping\nterms up to the second order, we obtain\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(3.43a)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(3.43b)\n\nr = \u03c4 v 1 \u2212 \u03b12 v 2 /6c2\nr = \u03c4 v 1 + \u03b2 2 v 2 /6c2\n\nfor \u03a9 > 1 and \u03a9 < 1, respectively. Using now the expressions for \u03b1 and \u03b2, Eqs. (3.43) then\nreduce into the single equation\ni\n\nh\n\nr = \u03c4 v 1 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9) v 2 /6c2 .\n\n(3.44)\n\nInverting now this equation by writing it as v = H0 r, we obtain in the lowest approximation\ni\n\nh\n\nH0 = h 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03a9) v 2 /6c2 ,\n\n(3.45)\n\nwhere h = \u03c4 \u22121 . To the same approximation one also obtains\nh\n\ni\n\nh\n\ni\n\nH0 = h 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03a9) z 2 /6 = h 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03a9) r 2 /6c2 \u03c4 2 ,\n12\n\n(3.46)\n\n\fwhere z is the redshift parameter. As is seen, and it is confirmed by experiments, H0 depends\non the distance it is being measured; it has physical meaning only at the zero-distance limit,\nnamely when measured locally, in which case it becomes h = 1/\u03c4 .\nIt follows that the measured value of H0 depends on the \"short\" and \"long\" distance\nscales [48]. The farther the distance H0 is being measured, the lower the value for H0 is\nobtained. By Eq. (3.46) this is possible only when \u03a9 < 1, namely when the universe is\naccelerating.\nThe possibility that the universe expansion is accelerating was first predicted using CGR\nby the author in 1996 [40] before the supernovae experiments results became known.\nIn the next section it is shown how the familiar Tolman metric can be looked upon as\nan expanding universe.\n\nIV. TOLMAN'S METRIC AS AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE\n\nIn the four-dimensional spacevelocity the Tolman metric is given by\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds2 = \u03c4 2 dv 2 \u2212 e\u03bc dr 2 \u2212 R2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03bc and R are functions of v and r alone, and comoving coordinates x\u03bc =\n(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (\u03c4 v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) have been used. With the above choice of coordinates, the\nzero-component of the geodesic equation becomes an identity, and since r, \u03b8 and \u03c6 are\nconstants along the geodesics, one has dx0 = ds and therefore\nu\u03b1 = u\u03b1 = (1, 0, 0, 0) .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe metric (4.1) shows that the area of the sphere r = constant is given by 4\u03c0R2 and that\nR should satisfy R\u2032 = \u2202R/\u2202r > 0. The possibility that R\u2032 = 0 at a point r0 should be\nexcluded since it would allow the lines r =constants at the neighboring points r0 and r0 + dr\nto coincide at r0 , thus creating a caustic surface at which the comoving coordinates break\ndown.\n13\n\n\fAs has been shown in the previous sections the universe expands by the null condition\nds = 0, and if the expansion is spherically symmetric one has d\u03b8 = d\u03c6 = 0. The metric (4.1)\nthen yields\n\u03c4 2 dv 2 \u2212 e\u03bc dr 2 = 0,\n\n(4.3)\n\ndr\n= \u03c4 e\u2212\u03bc/2 .\ndv\n\n(4.4)\n\nthus\n\nThis is the differential equation that determines the universe expansion. In the following we\nsolve the gravitational field equations in order to find out the function \u03bc (r).\nThe gravitational field equations (2.3), written in the form\n\u0012\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u03ba T\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1\n\u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd T ,\n2\n\u0013\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1ef f u\u03bc u\u03bd\n\n(4.6)\n\nwith \u03c1ef f = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1c and T = T\u03bc\u03bd g \u03bc\u03bd , are now solved. Using Eq.

From Eq. (4.17) we obtain\nthe first integral\n\u1e582 = f (r) +\n15\n\nF (r)\n,\nR\n\n(4.19)\n\n\fwhere F (r) is another arbitrary function of r. Substituting now (4.19) in Eq.

(4.22) with respect to r and using Eq. (4.20)\nwe also obtain\nR (v, r) = (\u03ba\u03c1ef f )\n\n\u22122/3\n\n\"\n\nv\nR1/2 (r) R\u2032 (r)\n\u00b1\n\u2032\n1/2\nF (r)\n2F (r)\n\n#\u22122/3\n\n.\n\n(4.24)\n\nFinally, from Eq.

The solutions (4.27) were given in spacetime\ncoordinates by Datt [49].\n16\n\n\fV. VALUE OF \u039b: THEORY VERSUS EXPERIMENT\n\nThe Einstein gravitational field equations with the added cosmological term are [45]:\n1\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R + \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd = \u03baT\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \u039b is the cosmological constant, the value of which is supposed to be determined by\nexperiment. In Eq. (5.1) R\u03bc\u03bd and R are the Ricci tensor and scalar, respectively, \u03ba = 8\u03c0G,\nwhere G is Newton's constant and the speed of light is taken as unity.\nRecently the two groups (the Supernovae Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova\nTeam) concluded that the expansion of the universe is accelerating [19-25]. Both teams\nobtained\n\u03a9M \u2248 0.3,\n\n\u03a9\u039b \u2248 0.7,\n\n(5.2)\n\nand ruled out the traditional (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b )=(1, 0) universe. Their value of the density parameter\n\u03a9\u039b corresponds to a cosmological constant that is small but, nevertheless, nonzero and\npositive,\n\u039b \u2248 10\u221252 m\u22122 \u2248 10\u221235 s\u22122 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nIn Sections 2 and 3 a four-dimensional cosmological theory was presented. The theory\npredicts that the universe accelerates and hence it is equivalent to having a positive value\nfor a cosmological constant in it. In the framework of this theory the zero-zero component\nof the field equations (2.3) is written as\n1\nR00 \u2212 \u03b400 R = \u03ba\u03c1ef f = \u03ba (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1c ) ,\n2\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere \u03c1c = 3/\u03ba\u03c4 2 is the critical mass density and \u03c4 is Hubble's time in the zero-gravity\nlimit.\nComparing Eq. (5.4) with the zero-zero component of Eq. (5.1), one obtains the expression for the cosmological constant,\n\u039b = \u03ba\u03c1c = 3/\u03c4 2 .\n17\n\n(5.5)\n\n\fTo find out the numerical value of \u03c4 we use the relationship between h = \u03c4 \u22121 and H0\ngiven by Eq. (3.46) (CR denote values according to Cosmological Relativity):\nh\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\ni\n\nz 2 /6 ,\nH0 = h 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03a9CR\nM\n\n(5.6)\n\n2\nwhere z is the redshift and \u03a9CR\nM = \u03c1M /\u03c1c where \u03c1c = 3h /8\u03c0G. (Notice that \u03c1c is different\n\nfrom the standard \u03c1c defined with H0 .) The redshift parameter z determines the distance\nat which H0 is measured. We choose z = 1 and take for\n\u03a9CR\nM = 0.245\n\n(5.7)\n\n(roughly corresponds to 0.3 in the standard theory), Eq. (5.6) then gives\nH0 = 0.874h.\n\n(5.8)\n\nAt the value z = 1 the corresponding Hubble parameter H0 according to the latest results\nfrom HST can be taken [28] as H0 = 72km/s-Mpc, thus h = (72/0.874)km/s-Mpc or\nh = 82.380km/s-Mpc,\n\n(5.9)\n\n\u03c4 = 12.16 \u00d7 109 years.\n\n(5.10)\n\nand\n\nCR\nST\nST\n2\nWhat is left is to find the value of \u03a9CR\n\u039b . We have \u03a9\u039b = \u03c1c /\u03c1c , where \u03c1c = 3H0 /8\u03c0G\n2\n2\nand \u03c1c = 3h2 /8\u03c0G. Thus \u03a9CR\n\u039b = (H0 /h) = 0.874 , or\n\n\u03a9CR\n\u039b = 0.764.\n\n(5.11)\n\nAs is seen from Eqs. (5.7) and (5.11) one has\nCR\n\u03a9CR\nM + \u03a9\u039b = 1.009 \u2248 1,\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhich means the universe is flat.\nAs a final result we calculate the cosmological constant according to Eq. (5.5). One\nobtains\n\u039b = 3/\u03c4 2 = 2.036 \u00d7 10\u221235 s\u22122 .\n18\n\n(5.13)\n\n\fOur results confirm those of the supernovae experiments and indicate on existance of the\ndark energy as has recently received confirmation from the Boomerang cosmic microwave\nbackground experiment [26,27], which showed that the universe is flat.\n\nVI. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper it has been shown that application of the relativistic theory in spacevelocity to the problem of the expansion of the universe yields on accelerating expansion.\nFurthermore, the cosmological constant that was extracted from the theory agrees with the\nexperimental result. Finally, it has also been shown that the three-dimensional spatial space\nof the universe is flat, again in agreement with observations.\n\n19\n\n\fREFERENCES\n1. E.
