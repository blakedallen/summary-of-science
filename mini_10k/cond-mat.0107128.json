The Mott\nand Peierls insulators compete with each other in their\nground states, while topological defects such as solitons\nand polarons appear in their excited states exhibiting\nunique transport properties [3]. In recent years, a new\nclass of these materials [4\u20137], which is characterized by\nbinuclear metal complexes bridged by halogens and is\nthus referred to as MMX chains, has stimulating further\ninterest in one-dimensional unit-assembled spin-chargelattice coupling systems. In comparison with MX chains,\nX\n\nM\n\nM\n\nX\n\nM\n\nM\n\nMMX chains indeed possess fascinating features. The\nformal oxidation state of the metal ions is 3+ in MX\nchains, whereas it is 2.5+ in MMX chains. Therefore,\nMMX chains have an unpaired electron per metal dimer\neven in their trapped-valence states, contrasting with\nthe valence-trapped state consisting of M 2+ and M 4+ in\nMX chains. The M (dz2 )-M (dz2 ) direct overlap in MMX\nchains effectively reduces the on-site Coulomb repulsion\ndue to its d\u03c3\u2217 character and therefore enhances the electrical conductivity. Some of MMX compounds [4,5] have\na neutral chain structure, where the metal sublattice gets\nrid of the hydrogen-bond network, and thus exhibit more\npronounced one dimensionality.\nFour possible one-dimensional charge-ordering modes\nof MMX chains were empirically pointed out [8\u201310] and\nthey were indeed verified theoretically [11,12]. Potential\nmagnetic phases have also been proposed [13] and a systematic study of broken-symmetry solutions in the twoband scheme has been presented [13,14].

We always\nset tMM and K both equal to unity. This Hamiltonian\npossesses various density-wave solutions [13], which are\nschematically shown in Fig. 1. (b) to (d) are accompanied by lattice distortion, where the latter two exhibit\ncell doubling. (e) to (h) are possible spin alignments and\ntheir nonlocal stabilization assumes weak interchain interaction. (c) and (g) are more characterized by charge\nand spin modulation on the X sublattice, respectively,\nthan by any density wave on the M2 sublattice. The relevance of the X pz orbitals to these states has fully been\ndemonstrated [13].\n\nhot argument due to recent stimulative observations\n[15]: With decreasing temperature, there occurs a metalsemiconductor transition, that is, a transition from the\naveraged-valence state (a) to the trapped-valence state\n(b), at 300 K, and further transition to the chargeordering mode (c) follows around 80 K. The roomtemperature conductivity is larger by nine digits than\nthose of typical MX chains, while the metal-sublattice\ndimerization has never been observed in MX chains. On\nthe other hand, the latter, pop complexes, have extensively been measured [8,9] and their ground states have\ngenerally been assigned to (d). However, due to the small\nPeierls gap, the ground states of these materials can be\ntuned by replacing the halogens and/or counter ions [16].\nSuch a tuning of the electronic state can be realized also\nby pressure [17] and the pressure-induced phase transitions of pop complexes are the central issue in this article.\nFigure 2 shows that the orbital hybridization within\nevery M2 moiety, which depends on the electron transfer\ntMM , is essential to the stabilization of M-CDW, whereas\nX-CDW owes its stabilization to the interdimer electron\ntransfer and thus to tMX . As the adjacent metals in the\ndimer are tightly locked to each other by the surrounding ligands, an applied pressure mainly reduces the M-X\ndistance. Therefore, from the viewpoint of the electron\ntransfer, increasing pressure should stabilize X-CDW instead of M-CDW. Swanson et al. [18] indeed observed a\npressure-induced reverse Peierls instability, namely, the\ndisappearance of the two sharp bands originating from\nthe Pt2+ -Pt2+ and Pt3+ -Pt3+ stretching modes in the\nRaman spectra and the red shift of the intervalence\ncharge-transfer band due to the d\u03c3\u2217 (Pt2+ ) \u2192 d\u03c3\u2217 (Pt3+ )\ncharge-transfer gap in the absorption spectra with increasing pressure, for a pop-family MMX compound\nK4 [Pt2 (pop)4 Br]*3H2 O at 20 K. However, there has quite\nrecently appeared another report [19] that an applied\npressure stabilizes M-CDW. Matsuzaki et al. have systematically synthesized numerous pop-family iodo complexes changing the counter ions and have found that as\nthe M-X-M distance increases, their valence structure is\ngenerally tuned from (d) to (b). They applied pressure\nto one of these samples, [(C2 H5 )2 NH2 ]4 [Pt2 (pop)4 I], at\nroom temperature and observed a phase transition from\nBOW to M-CDW, that is, a pressure-induced Peierls instability. Increasing interdimer charge transfer and resultant charge proportionation look disadvantageous to\nM-CDW as well as to BOW. Neither the M-X Coulomb\nrepulsion VMX nor the interdimer direct one VMXM distinguishes between these states within the single-band\nscheme of the electronic configuration (Fig. 2). There\nmust lie intertwining driving forces in the BOW-to-MCDW transition. It is our aim to explain the two contrasting pressure-induced phenomena consistently.\nWe calculate the free energy for the broken-symmetry\nsolutions (a) to (h) of the Hamiltonian (1) within the\nHartree-Fock approximation. The lattice distortion is\nadiabatically determined at each temperature so as to\nminimize the free energy. Although the Hamiltonian (1)\n\nE\n(a)\nM2.5 M2.5 X\n\nM2.5 M2.5 X\n\nM2.5 E\n\nk\n\nM2\n\nM2\n\nM2 E\n\nk\n\nM2E\n\nk\n\n(b)\nM3 X\n\nM3 X\n\n(c)\nM2\n\nM3 X\n\nM3\n\nM2\n\nX\n\n(d)\nM2\n\nM2\n\nX\n\nM3\n\nM3 X\n\nM2\n\nk\n\nFIG. 2. Local electronic structures and the resultant band\nstructures of the four charge-ordering modes provided the\nCoulomb interaction is not so strong, where the valence\nnumbers denote formal oxidation states, namely, 2+ and\n3+ should generally be regarded as (2 + \u03b4)+ and (3 \u2212 \u03b4)+\n(0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.5), respectively: (a) PM, (b) BOW, (c) X-CDW,\nand (d) M-CDW.\n\nThe existent MMX complexes consist of two families: M2 (dta)4 I (M = Pt, Ni; dta = dithioacetate =\nCH3 CS2\u2212 ) and R4 [Pt2 (pop)4 X]*nH2 O (X = Cl, Br, I;\nR = Li, K, Cs, * * *; pop = diphosphonate = P2 O5 H22\u2212 ).\nThe former, dta complexes, are not yet well investigated and one of them, Pt2 (dta)4 I, has just come into\n2\n\n\ftemperature range. Then we inquire into the effect of the\nelectronic correlation. We focus on the thermal behavior\nat tMX = 0.8 in Fig. 3(a) and visualize its dependence\non VMX in Fig. 3(b). Though a significant increase of\nVMX destabilizes M-CDW and leads to the oxidation of\nthe halogen ions inducing spin moments on the halogen\nsites, the competition between BOW and M-CDW looks\nmuch less sensitive to VMX varying independently of tMX .\nBesides the electron transfer and correlation, the onsite electron affinity may be influenced by an applied\npressure. On the one hand, increasing pressure enhances\nthe overlap between the adjacent M dz2 and X pz orbitals, effectively leading to a reduction of the difference\nbetween the two orbital energies, \u2206\u03b5 = \u03b5M \u2212 \u03b5X . On the\nother hand, from the viewpoint of the Madelung energy,\na reduction of the M-X distance causes the Coulomb potential on the metal sites to rise and therefore enhances\n\u2206\u03b5. Hence it is likely that the resultant net change of\n\u2206\u03b5 is not so significant as those of tMX and VMX . Furthermore, the electronic state turns out insensitive to \u2206\u03b5\nunder a reasonable condition tMX <\n\u223c tMM [6,7]. The thermal behavior at tMX = 0.8 in Fig. 3(a) is again taken\nup and its dependence on \u2206\u03b5 is shown in Fig. 3(c). The\nelectronic state shows little dependence on \u2206\u03b5 all over the\ntemperature range. Thus, we reasonably assume that an\napplied pressure only influences the M-X electron transfer and Coulomb repulsion.\n\n1.0\n(a)\n0.8\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nPM\n\nPM\n\nBOW\n\nBOW\n\nM-CDW\n\nM-CDW\n\nPM\n\nkB T\n\n0.6\n\nBOW\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nM-CDW\n\nX-CDW\n\nX-SDW\n\n0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6\ntMX\n\n0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9\nVMX\n\u2206\u03b5\n\nFIG. 3.

According to expectation, Fig. 3(a) shows that M-CDW\nis transformed into X-CDW as tMX increases. The\nidea of interdimer charge proportionation with increasing tMX is still applicable to the high-temperature\nbehavior. At low temperatures, the electrons lower\ntheir energy with the Peierls gap open, but with increasing temperature, the entropy becomes relevant to\nthe free energy.\nSince its contribution\nis expressed\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP \b\nas T S = k (Ek \u2212 \u03bc)fk + kB T ln 1 + e\u2212(Ek \u2212\u03bc)/kB T ,\nwhere fk = [1 + e(Ek \u2212\u03bc)/kB T ]\u22121 with the energy dispersion Ek and the chemical potential \u03bc, the electrons\ncome to prefer the metallic states BOW and PM to the\nPeierls-gap states M-CDW and X-CDW with increasing\ntemperature. BOW exhibits charge disproportionation\nwithin each M-X-M moiety and it is thus replaced by\nPM with increasing tMX . In a thermal stabilization,\nBOW precedes PM due to its flatter conduction band\n(Fig. 2), which is more advantageous for gaining the\nentropy. As the thermal phase boundary between BOW\nand M-CDW weakly depends on tMX , BOW may in principle be transformed into M-CDW with increasing tMX .\nHowever, such a transition is possible only in a narrow\n\nkBT\n\n0.6\nBOW\n\nBOW\n\n0.2\n\nM-CDW\n\nX-CDW\n\nM-CDW X-CDW\n\n\u2206 CDW\n\n0.0\n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2\ntMX\n2.4\n(a')\n(b')\n\n0.9\n(c)\n\nPM\n\nPM\n\n0.4\n\n0.7\n\nBOW\n\nX-SDW\n\nhave numerous parameters in itself, there is still plenty\nwhich may be taken into the model. For example, the\nhalogen on-site energy may also be coupled to lattice,\nwhile there may be an interdimer direct spring constant due to the hydrogen bonds between the ligands\nand counter ions. However, a weak alternation of the\nlower orbital energy is much less important and the coexistent elastic forces can be renormalized into \u03b1 and\n\u03b2. Indeed, the present model can successfully reproduce\nthe observed optical conductivity [20], suggesting that all\nthe essential interactions can well be described by the parameters on hand. In such circumstances that even the\nhopping amplitudes are not yet determined, we should\nminimize the number of parameters.\n\nM-CDW X-CDW\n\n0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2\n(c')\n\n1.6\n0.8\n\nFIG. 4. Thermal phase boundaries and the Peierls gaps\n\u2206CDW as functions of tMX and VMX varying under connections \u2206VMX = 0.8\u2206tMX (a, a\u2032 ), \u2206VMX = 1.0\u2206tMX (b, b\u2032 ),\nand \u2206VMX = 1.2\u2206tMX (c, c\u2032 ), where the rest of the parameters are the same as those in Fig. 3. In (a\u2032 ) to (c\u2032 ), the solid\nand dotted lines represent the gaps for M-CDW and X-CDW,\nrespectively.\n\nNow we are eager to look into the combined pressure\neffects. In Fig. 4 we observe the electronic state connecting the increase of the Coulomb repulsion, \u2206VMX ,\nwith the enhancement of the electron transfer, \u2206tMX .\n3\n\n\fThe low-temperature reverse Peierls instability with increasing pressure is steadfast under any parametrization. With increasing pressure, the energy gap decreases\nand then increases via the first-order transition from MCDW to X-CDW, though the latter process has not yet\nbeen observed explicitly [21]. On the other hand, the\nhigh-temperature behavior is much more sensitive to the\nparametrization. Assuming a predominant pressure effect on tMX , there exists a little possibility of BOW being\ntransformed into M-CDW. BOW is more likely to change\ninto X-CDW at intermediate temperatures and into PM\nat sufficiently high temperatures with increasing pressure. As we switch on the other pressure effect on VMX ,\nM-CDW begins to grow between BOW and X-CDW. Although this is no longer a simple quantum competition,\nit may still be useful to observe the resultant changes of\nthe Peierls gaps. We ascribe the pressure-induced BOWto-M-CDW transition to a thermal competition between\nM-CDW and X-CDW rather than to any competition between BOW and M-CDW themselves, because growing\nM-CDW appears to go with diminishing X-CDW in Fig.\n4. Increasing tMX destabilizes M-CDW and stabilizes\nX-CDW, reducing and enhancing their quantum energy\ngaps. Within a single-band description assuming the X\npz orbitals to be stably filled, there occurs no quantum\ncompetition due to VMX between M-CDW and X-CDW.\nOnce we consider the oxidation of the halogen ions and\nits contribution to the stabilization of X-CDW [13], increasing VMX more advantageously acts on X-CDW than\non M-CDW and indeed accelerates the increase and decrease of their energy gaps (Figs. 4(a\u2032 ) to 4(c\u2032 )). At\nfinite temperatures, decreasing gap induces thermal fluctuations and contributes to gaining the entropy. We are\nthus convinced that simultaneously increasing tMX and\nVMX more stabilize X-CDW than M-CDW in the quantum competition, while vice versa in the thermal competition.\nThus, we are led to the conclusion that the lowtemperature pressure-induced reverse Peierls instability\n[18] is essentially ascribed to the resultant enhancement\nof the electron transfer, whereas the combined increases\nof the electron transfer and the Coulomb repulsion\nare really relevant to the room-temperature pressureinduced Peierls instability [19], where the latter effect\npredominates over the former one in magnitude. If\nthe present scenario is true, successive phase transitions are expected with increasing pressure in a certain\ntemperature range. The low-temperature pressure effects on K4 [Pt2 (pop)4 X]*3H2 O (X = Cl, Br) [18,21] were\nmeasured up to 10 GPa, while the room-temperature\nones on [(C2 H5 )2 NH2 ]4 [Pt2 (pop)4 I] [19] within 2 GPa.\nTherefore, the latter experiments can further be developed. Higher-pressure experiments around room temperature may reveal successive transitions such as BOW \u2192\nM-CDW \u2192 X-CDW and BOW \u2192 M-CDW \u2192 PM.\nSuch observations may become more feasible by tuning the initial electronic state toward the BOW-M-CDW\nphase boundary, for example, with the replacement of the\n\ncounter ions by NH3 (C3 H6 )NH3 or (C5 H11 )2 NH2 [19].\nWe stress the direct transition from M-CDW to PM as\nan evidence of the predominant pressure effect on the\nCoulomb interaction. No pop-family MMX compound\nwhose ground state is X-CDW has been found so far,\nbut it may exist under pressure. On the other hand,\nthe dta-family platinum complex Pt2 (dta)4 I exhibits a\nground state of the X-CDW type and must display different pressure-induced phenomena. Further extensive\nmeasurements on both pop- and dta-family MMX compounds under high static pressure are encouraged.\nThe author is grateful to Prof. K. Yonemitsu for fruitful discussion.
