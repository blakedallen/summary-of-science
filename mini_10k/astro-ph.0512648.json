It would be a unique probe of the IMCOs\nwhose nature has been under the veil of mistery.\n\n1 Introduction\nGravitational lensing is a powerful tool for constraining the amount of the dark matter in the form of\ncompact objects. However, there is no stringent constraint on the intermediate mass compact objects\n(IMCOs) with a mass scale of 102\u22124 M\u2299 and on the sub-lunar mass compact objects (SULCOs) with a\nmass scale of < 10\u22127 M\u2299 (Inoue & Tanaka 2003).\nIn particular, a method of directly detecting the IMCOs has been highly desired because the IMCOs\nare important baryonic dark matter candidates as well. The IMCO can be an intermediate mass black\nhole or an intermediate mass cold dark matter (CDM) subhalo. The nature of both types of IMCOs has\nnot been understood well.\nIn fact, the abundance of these IMCOs can be much larger than expected. Recent observation of the\nultra-luminous X-ray sources suggests a presence of IMBHs not only in the neighborhood of galaxy\nnucleus but also in the star clusters in the galactic halo far from the nucleus (Matsumoto et al 2001,\nRoberts et al 2004). Furthermore, the early reionization (z \u223c 20) (Bennett et al. 2003) suggested by\nthe WMAP observation of the temperature-polarization correlation may indicate strong UV radiation\nfrom massive first stars at the early period (z \u223c 20) with a top-heavy IMF (Cen, 2003) or that from\na large number of micro-QSOs (Madau, et al. 2004), which imply the existence of a large number\nof IMCOs. The IMBHs are certainly important building blocks for making the super massive black\nholes (SMBHs). Unfortunately, their evolution has been under the veil of mistery. Measurements of\n1\n\n\fthe abundance and the spatial distribution of the IMBHs inside the galactic halo would shed a new light\non the evolution history of the SMBHs.\nSimilarly, we do not know anything about the abundance of the intermediate mass 102\u22125 M\u2299 CDM\nsubhalos. Although they may suffer the tidal breaking owing to the gradient in the gravitational potential of the galaxy halo, any compact objects whose size is smaller than the tidal radius can survive.\nBecause a calculation of the survival probability during the major merger of galaxies is an intractable\nproblem(see also Taylor & Babul 2005), we need to observationally constrain the abundance of the\nCDM subhalos.\nTo do so, we propose to observe radio-loud QSO-galaxy strong lens systems with a submilliarcsecond resolution, which will be achieved by the next space VLBI missions sush as the VSOP2\n(Hirabayashi et al). Then the submillilensing effects by IMCO perturbers can be directly measured\n(Inoue & Chiba 2003).\n\n2 Theory\nThe Einstein angular radius of a point mass with a mass M is written in terms of the angular diameter\ndistance to the lens DL , to the source DS , between the lens and the source DLS as\n\u03b8E \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\nM\n102 M\u2299\n\n! 21\n\nDL DS /DLS\nGpc\n\n!\u2212 21\n\nmas.\n\n(1)\n\nTherefore, the radio interferometer with a resolution of 0.04 mas can resolve the distortion of the\nimage within the Einstein ring for a point mass M \u223c 200M\u2299 . As is well known, the surface density\nwithin the Einstein radius of the macrolens is nearly critical. Therefore, the possibility of gravitational\nsubmillilensing by the IMCOs within the Einstein ring of the macrolens (=galaxy halo) is very large.\nFurthermore, in the high frequency band (> 40GHz), any absorption owing to the plasma along the\nline of sight to the jets is suppressed. Thus, a high-resolution radio mapping of the QSO-galaxy lens\nsystems is an ideallistic method for directly detecting the IMCOs.\n\n3 Model\nTo estimate the observational feasibility, we consider a simple model of a typical QSO-galaxy lensing\nsystem B1422+231, which consists of three magnified images A,B,C and a demagnified image D. The\nredshifts of the source and the lens are zS = 3.62 and zL = 0.34, respectively. To model the macrolensing, we adopt a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) in a constant external shear field in which the\nisopotential curves in the projected surface perpendicular to the line of sight are ellipses (Kormann et\nal. 1994). The perturbing IMCOs are modeled as point masses.\n\n2\n\n\f4 Simulation\nThe surface number density of the perturbers near the Einstein ring for the macrolens with a radius\n(rE \u223c 3.8kpc) is found to be N \u223c f \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 101 (M/103 M\u2299 )\u22121 mas\u22122 where f denotes the ratio of\nthe surface mass density of the perturbers to that of the dark halo. If we assume that the area of the\nmagnified image of the QSO jet is (10pc)2 , then we expect one IMBH in the line of sight to the jet\nof B1422+231 if f = 0.003. On the one hand, the total mass within the Einstein radius rE \u223c 3.8kpc\nis \u223c 1011 M\u2299 . On the other hand, the total baryoic mass within the Einstein radius of the macrolens\nis \u223c 1010 M\u2299 . From the Magorrian relation, the mass of the SMBH at the nucleus is expected to be\n\u223c 107\u22128 M\u2299 . Thus, we can find an IMBH in the line of sight to the jet if the total mass of the IMBH\n\u223c 0.003 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 is comparable to the mass of the SMBH provided that the IMBHs traces the mass\ndistribution of the dark halo of the macrolens. In the extreme case where the IMBHs constitute the\nentire macrolens halo, the submillilensing effects owing to the IMBHs are very distinct (figure 1). We\nwould observe a several hundreds of monopole-like or dipole-like distortion patterns in the surface\nbrightness profile of the QSO jet if observed with a submilli-arcsec resolution.\n\n5 Extended-source effect\nIf the the perturber is spatially extended (e.g. a singular isothermal sphere), then the lensing effect is\ndifferent from that of a point mass. The density profile of the perturber can be reconstructed from the\nlocal mapping between the observed image and the non-perturbed image obtained from the prediction\nof the macrolens. In fact, the power of the radial density profile of the perturbers can be reconstructed\nfrom the perturbed image within the Einstein ring of the perturber (Inoue & Chiba 2005b). Then we\ncan make a distinction between the IMBH and the CDM subhalo. Furthermore, from the distortion\noutside the Einstein ring of the perturber, the degeneracy between the perturber mass and the distance\ncan be broken provided that the Einstein radius of the perturber is sufficiently smaller than that of\nthe macrolens(Inoue & Chiba 2005a). The precise measurement of the spatial variation in the surface\nbrightness of the QSO jet will provide us a large amount of information about the mass, abundance,\nand the spatial distribution of IMCOs.\n\n6 Summary\nIf there are a sufficent number of IMCOs inside the macrolens galactic halo, then we will be able to\ndirectly detect the silhouette of the IMCOs using the next space interferometers with a submilli-arcsec\nresolution in the radio band. By measuring the local distortion of the QSO jet, we will be able to\ndetermine the density profile of the IMCOs. The direct detection of the IMBHs or the CDM subhalos\nwill shed a new light on the formation process of the SMBHs and the reionization process which have\nbeen under the veil of mistery.\n\n3\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Bennett, C.
