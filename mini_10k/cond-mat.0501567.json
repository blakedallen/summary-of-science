One common feature of these systems is the development of a local threshold instability in an avalanching manner. In the late 80s the concept of selforganized criticality (SOC) was proposed by Bak et al. [2] for the dynamical-statistical behavior of\nsuch systems. SOC has been applied to a variety of systems (see Jensen [3] and references therein\nfor a list of some such systems). Although SOC can exist, strictly speaking, only in the limit of\ninfinitely slow external input where complete separation of time scales is achieved [4] , it has also\nbeen applied to presumably avalanching systems with strong driving. A good example of such systems is space plasma and, in particular, the plasma in Earth's magnetotail under magnetic substorm\nconditions [5]. Since SOC is questionable for such strongly driven systems we, in what follows,\naddress to them as to avalanching systems, bearing in mind the avalanche-like propagation of local\ninstabilities. Up to date the most often used tool for studies of such systems is numerical modeling.\nThe usual analytical approaches proposed so far are the renormalization group methods (see,e.g.,\nRefs. [3, 6] and references therein), and the mean-field description (see,e.g., Refs. [3, 7] and references therein). The renormalization group methods assume scaling from the very beginning and\nare applied only in the close vicinity of the stationary (critical) point, that is, in the self-organized\ncriticality regime. The mean-field approach is based on the analysis of the mean number of active,\npassive, and critical sites. It is not restricted to the criticality range only including it as the limit\nof zero number of active sites. Mean-field approximations predict self-organized criticality in the\nlimit of zero average number of active sites and, strictly speaking, are applicable only for system\ndimension exceeding some critical number, often well above the dimension of real physical systems [8]. Mean-field obtained exponents are often consistent with those found experimentally and\nnumerically for lower dimensions too but no quantitative explanation is given. On the other hand,\ndeviations from these exponents for real systems are quite usual. The mean-field approach does\nnot take into account the tendency of the active sites to organize in clusters. Indeed, if avalanches\nof various durations and sizes are present, the distribution of active sites at any moment should be\nvery inhomogeneous. In the present paper we propose a novel approach to the analytical description of avalanching systems which is based on the kinetic equation for the distribution function\nfor active site clusters. We demonstrate the power of the kinetic formalism applying to the model\nwhich was recently proposed as a model of avalanching reconnection in the current sheet of the\n\n2\n\n\fEarth magnetosphere [9].\n\nII.\n\nKINETIC EQUATIONS FOR CLUSTERS\n\nThe mean-field approach has the obvious drawback of ignoring that active sites have the tendency to appear in clusters. These clusters are, in fact, the instantaneous snapshot of the developing\navalanches, so that the size of each cluster is time dependent, w = w(t). However, when considering many coexisting clusters, we may describe their behavior with the help of the distribution\nfunction f (w, t) = dN/dw, where now the cluster size w and time t are independent variables.\nThe evolution of the single cluster size will be translated into the evolution of the distribution\nfunction. The total number of active sites is given by the integral\nZ \u221e\nNa =\nwf (w)dw\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nWe have to introduce also the number of passive sites N(0) (similar to what is done in case of\na Bose-gas, where the number of particles in the lowest state is macroscopically large). Then\nNa + N(0) = const.\nLet P+ (w1 , w2 ) be the probability of the cluster growth (per unit time), and P\u2212 (w1 , w2 ) be the\nprobability of shrinking. Then\nZ w\nZ \u221e\n\u2202f (w)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n=\nP+ (w, w )f (w )dw +\nP\u2212 (w, w \u2032)f (w \u2032)dw \u2032\n\u2202t\n0\nw\nZ \u221e\nZ w\nf (w)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212\nP+ (w , w)f (w)dw \u2212\nP\u2212 (w \u2032 , w)f (w)dw \u2032 + \u03b3(w)N(0) \u2212\n\u03c4 (w)\nw\n0\n\n(2)\n\nThe term \u03b3(w)N(0) in (2) describes the birth of active states due to external driving, while the\nlast term takes into account the finite life-time of clusters, i.e. the transition to the passive state\n(Bose-Einstein condensation). If the driving is sufficiently strong and avalanche merging is not\nnegligible, the kinetic equation (2) should be completed with the with the time-dependent \"nonlinear\" merging terms\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2202f (w)\n= P1 (w, w1, w2 )f (w1 )f (w2 )\u03b4(w \u2212 w1 \u2212 w2 )dw1dw2\n\u2202t\nm\nZ\n\u2212 P1 (w1 , w, w2)f (w)f (w2)\u03b4(w1 \u2212 w \u2212 w2 )dw1 dw2 .\n\n(3)\n\nMerging becomes progressively more important when the average fractional density of active sites\nincreases. When this density is not too large (it does not have to be small though, in contrast with\n3\n\n\fthe SOC regime), merging will be still relatively weak and can be further studied perturbatively.\nStrong merging corresponds to the very strong driving, so that the system behavior is, at least\npartially, forced externally. In the present paper we assume that driving is moderate (not weak and\nnot exceptionally strong) so that merging can be ignored at this stage, deferring treatment of very\nstrongly driven systems to elsewhere. In our case one can expect that there is a wide range (inertial\ninterval) of cluster sizes in which the distribution shape is independent of the external driving and\nis determined by internal dynamics and/or space dimension.\nIn general, the distribution function f (w) would depend on the growth and shrinking probabilities. We shall consider here the class of systems where growth and shrinking occur only at the\nboundaries of clusters. It should be noted that the dynamics inside clusters may induce transitions\nbetween active and passive sites, producing, e.g. \"punctuated\" clusters for the classical sandpile\nmodel [2], where an active site becomes passive at the next step. We shall measure the size of\nsuch cluster including the passive (receiving) sites as well, so that the internal dynamics does not\naffect the cluster size. Situation may be more complicated when clusters are developed fractals,\nwith tunnels appearing and crossing the cluster [1]. Such systems would probably require special\ntreatment. We restrict ourselves here with the clusters which grow of shrink at their boundaries.\nSpace and laboratory plasma systems [10] seem to belong to this class.\nIn this case the probabilities are nonzero only for |w \u2032 \u2212 w| = \u2206 \u226a w, so that (2) can be written\n\n\u2202f\n= \u2212P\u0303\u2212 (w)\u03c3(w)f (w) \u2212 P\u0303+ (w)\u03c3(w)f (w)\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\n+ P\u0303\u2212 (w + \u2206)\u03c3(w + \u2206)f (w + \u2206) + P\u0303+ (w \u2212 \u2206)\u03c3(w \u2212 \u2206)f (w \u2212 \u2206),\nwhere \u03c3(w) is the density of states. This approximation is not valid for small w, where the cluster\nkinetics should be strongly affected directly by driving. We seek for an approximate description of\nthe cluster kinetics in the range where it is determined but the internal features of the system rather\nthan by external influence. It is obvious, that if a large size strong driving is applied the reaction\nof the system would be a forced reaction and not self-organized in any way.\nThe approximation may be not accurate for largest clusters either, since possible fractality\n[1] of clusters may result in the breakdown of independence of probabilities at neighboring active\nboundary sites. Indeed, all numerical simulations [3] show distortions for very small and very large\nw. Thus, the physical sense of our approximation is that we are working in the inertial interval far\nfrom both limits. According to existing analyses, such interval exists almost always.\n4\n\n\fFor one-dimensional clusters \u03c3(w) = 1 or \u03c3(w) = 2 (the latter holds for growth in both\ndirections). This allows immediate n-dimensional generalization. Let w be a linear measure of\na cluster (effective radius), and let D be the cluster volume. The density of states \u03c3 is then the\ncluster surface area. In general, D \u221d w \u03bc , \u03c3 \u221d w \u03bd , n \u2265 \u03bc > \u03bd \u2265 n \u2212 1, where \u03bc and \u03bd are fractal\ndimensions of the cluster volume and boundary, respectively. Taylor expanding (4) we arrive at\nthe following differential equation\n\u2202f\n\u2202\n\u22022\n=\n(\u03b1\u03c3f ) +\n(\u03b2\u03c3f ),\n\u2202t\n\u2202w\n\u2202w 2\nwhere \u03b1 = \u2206(P\u0303\u2212 \u2212 P\u0303+ ) and \u03b2 = (\u22062 /2)(P\u0303\u2212 + P\u0303+ ). The stationary solution\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\nf \u221d (1/\u03b2\u03c3) exp \u2212 (\u03b1/\u03b2)dw ,\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nexists only if \u03b1 > 0. In general, \u03b1 and \u03b2 can depend on w. Both describe the local growth (shrinking) per site at the cluster surface. Their dependence on the cluster size would mean essentially\nthat the growth and shrinking probabilities as well as variation of the affected neighbor zone at\nsome site depend on what happens at other sites. While, in principle, this cannot be excluded\n(waves could transfer information across the cluster or long range forces are involved [1]), many\navalanche systems seem to be governed by local dynamics, so that it is natural to consider (at least\nat this stage) the case of probabilities independent of w (see, however, comment in section III).\nOne finds\nf \u221d \u03c3 \u22121 exp(\u2212w/wc ) = w \u2212\u03bd exp(\u2212w/wc ),\n\n(7)\n\nwith wc = const. The obtained f = dN/dw describes the distribution of linear sizes (effective\nradii). For the distribution of the cluster volumes one has\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ndw dN\ndN\n=\n*\n\u221d D (1\u2212\u03bc\u2212\u03bd)/\u03bc exp \u2212AD \u03bc .\ndD\ndD dw\n\n(8)\n\nIn the mean-field limit n \u226b 1 [7] one has (dN/dD) \u221d D \u22122 .\nThe derived expressions assume isotropy. If the system is anisotropic and/or a preferential shape\nof cluster exists, e.g. clusters are elongated [1], the above treatment may have to be modified\nby considering vector w describing linear sizes along principal axes. These modifications are of\ntechnical character and do not change substantially the basic equations and conclusions. Yet, they\nrequire a more lengthy analysis and cannot be presented in a letter. We will provide this analysis\nelsewhere.\n5\n\n\fIII.\n\nBURNING MODEL\n\nThe above theory can be illustrated on the simple \"burning\" model [9] described below. In this\nmodel each site is characterized by its temperature, T (x). The external driving is random heating\nof the sites. The amount q of heat per unit time is going to a site with probability p, so that the\naverage heat transfer from outside (in driving) is pq. The temperature of a passive site (the one\nwhich is not burning) changes according to\ndT\n= qp(1 \u2212 \u03b7(t)),\ndt\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b7(t) is a random number, |\u03b7| \u2264 1, so that h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 )i = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). Once T > Tc , where Tc\nis some critical temperature, the site becomes active. An active site burns and produces heat at the\nrate J = \u03bcT , \u03bc < 1. During the burning stage the temperature decreases (unless driving is strong\nenough to force permanent burning). When the temperature drops below some value Tl such that\nT < Tl < Tc , the burning ceases and the site becomes passive again. Part of the heat release is\nlost (radiated away), while the other part, aJ, is transferred (isotropically) to the closest neighbors.\nSummarizing the above, the heat release can be written approximately as\nJ = \u03bcT \u03b8(Tc \u2212 T )\u03b8(\u2212dT /dt)\u03b8(T \u2212 Tl ) + \u03bcT \u03b8(T \u2212 Tc )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b8(x) is the step function. The term \u03b8(\u2212dT /dt) is an approximate manifestation of the history dependent (hysteresis) burning for Tc > T > Tl (burning now if it was burning at the previous\nmoment/step and not burning otherwise). This expression is not quite correct for the temperature\nof a site does not have to change monotonically when an avalanche develops. We leave the more\ndetailed discussion of this for another paper especially devoted to this model. For the purposes\nof the present discussion such details are irrelevant, and we consider (10) as a sufficiently precise\ndescription of the burning process. If an active site would be left alone, its temperature would decrease as T = T (0) exp(\u2212\u03bct). Here the quantity \u03c4 \u2248 (1/\u03bc) ln(Tc /Tl ) has the meaning of the life\ntime of an active site if it were not affected neither by other sites nor external driving. Let \u2206t be\nthe time step and \u2206l the site size. The amount of heat a site x is receives is given by\ndT (x)\n= qp[1 \u2212 \u03b7(t)] + a[J(x + \u2206l ) + J(x \u2212 \u2206l )] \u2212 J(x),\ndt\n\n(11)\n\nwhich we write in the following form\na\u22062l \u2202 2 J\ndT (x)\n= qp[1 \u2212 \u03b7(t)] + (2a \u2212 1)J +\n.\ndt\n2 \u2202x2\n6\n\n(12)\n\n\fIntegrating (11) over a cluster of the size w, one gets\nZ\nZ\nd\nT dx = qpw + (2a \u2212 1) Jdx \u2212 Jb ,\ndt\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we averaged over time the random fluctuations of the input \u03b7. The last term is the heat flux\nat the boundaries.\nThe probability of growth should be proportional to the heat flux from the active site at the cluster boundary to the neighboring passive sites. This probability should depend on the temperature\nof the passive sites. In the stationary regime the time-average growth probability would be determined by the average temperature Tp of passive sites. Thus, growth is essentially independent\nof the cluster size. Respectively, the shrinking probability depends on the state of the boundary\nsite and is not particularly sensitive to the cluster size either. In this case the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2\nare constant, and one expects that the cluster distribution is an exponential, f \u221d exp(\u2212w/w0 ).\nHowever, if the heat transfer in the active area is suppressed (active sites do not easily accept heat\nfrom active neighbors) spreading from the central regions with the constant speed up to the cluster\nboundaries, one estimates that P+ \u221d 1/w, while P\u2212 \u2248 const. In this case \u03b1 = \u2206(a1 \u2212 a2 /w),\nand \u03b2 = (a1 + a2 /w)\u22062 /2, and f \u221d (w + w0 )\u03bb exp(\u2212w/wc ), where w0 , wc and \u03bb are constants.\nIn the range w0 \u226a w \u226a wc (if such this range does exists at all) a power-law distribution should\nbe observed. In the opposite case, when the heat is transferred immediately from the inside to the\ncluster boundaries, P+ \u221d w and P\u2212 \u2248 const, no stationary state can exist, since \u03b1 < 0 for sufficiently large w. Such systems are unstable and are disrupted into avalanches which will cover the\nentire system.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe proposed a kinetic approach to the description of avalanching systems, defining a distribution function f (w, t) for the clusters of active sites. In this way we derived a kinetic equation\nfor the temporal evolution of f (w, t) and analyzed its steady state limit in the inertial range, sufficiently far from the smallest scales where driving explicitly shows up, and sufficiently far from the\nlarges scales where fractality and merging become progressively more important. The stationary\ndistribution function f (w) depends, in general, on the probability of the micro-processes resulting\nin cluster growth and shrinking, that is, the processes governing the evolution of avalanches. In the\ncase of locally induced growth at the boundaries the shape of the distribution is determined by the\n7\n\n\fdimension of the system (or fractal dimensions of clusters if they are not compact). There is no\nsensitivity to the input details. The obtained universal shape of the distributions is not limited to\nthe weak driving regime or to the system dimension above some critical value, and can be used for\ndirect and easy comparison with experiments and numerical modelling. The total average driving\nshould affect the state of the system, as we have shown in a particular model. The estimates given\nin the present model represent just the first step toward a more elaborated kinetic model of the\ndynamics of avalanches. We remark that our analytical predictions have been checked by 1D and\n2D burning model simulations to be reported elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been performed within the framework of the \"Observable features of avalanching\nsystems\" ISSI Science Team.\n\n[1] Sethna, J.
