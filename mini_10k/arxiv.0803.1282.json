It is characterized as antiferromagnetic semiconductor around\nLaOMnAs side and ferromagnetic metal around LaOCoAs. Both LaOFeAs and LaONiAs, where\nsuperconductivity were discovered, are located at the borderline of magnetic phases. Extensive\nFermi surface analysis suggests that the observed superconductivity is of electron-type in its origin. We discuss possible pairing mechanisms in the context of competing ferromagnetic phases\nfound in this work and the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.\n\nThe studies on new superconductors, particularly noncuperate layered compounds, are always exciting and open\nup new windows for the possible further raising of transition temperature Tc . Except few of non-transition-metal\ncompounds, such as MgB2 , where superconductivity with\nTc up to 39K was found [1], problems in many cases are\nas complicated and challenging as what we found in cuperates. In the layered ruthenates, the ferromagnetic spin\nfluctuation is important and spin-triplet p-wave character was suggested [2] for the superconductivity found in\nSr2 RuO4 with Tc \u223c1K [3]. In a more recent example\nNax CoO2 *(H2 O)y [4], the geometry fluctuations due to\ntriangle-lattice are extensively discussed [5]. Here we will\nshow that a rich doping-dependent phase diagram can be\nrealized in the new family of layered compounds LaOMP\nor LaOMAs (M=V\u2013Cu), where up to Tc =26K superconductivity was reached very recently in LaOFeAs after F\u2212\ndoping [6\u20138].\nThe quaternary oxypnictides LaOMAs crystallize in layered tetragonal structure with P 4/nmm symmetry [9].\nEach transition-metal (oxygen) layer is sandwiched by two\nnearest-neighbor As (La) atomic layers, which form edgeshared tetrahedrons around the M (oxygen) sites. The\n(MAs)\u2212 and (LaO)+ triple-layer-subgroups stack alternatively along the c-axis. The positions of La or As sheets\nare determined by two internal parameters, zLa and zAs ,\n\nwhich define the inter-layer distances of La-O and MAs, respectively. It is important that this series of compounds are chemically stable such that systematical tuning is available without altering the structure and symmetry significantly. For instance, a variety of compounds\ncan be synthesized by the replacement of transition-metal\nelements, where both the electron doping and hole doping\ncan be realized by replacing O2\u2212 or La3+ ions. Except\nthe early report for the structure study [9], the detailed\nstudies on the electronic and magnetic properties for this\nseries of compounds are still in its early stage. It was first\nreported in 2006 that superconductivity can be realized in\nLaOFeP below 4K, and the Tc was increased to 7K by Fdoping [6]. Later, superconductivity with Tc about 2K was\nreported for LaONiP [7], and Tc around 26K was reached\nvery recently in LaOFeAs again after F-doping [8]. We will\npresent in this letter that both M=Fe and Ni compounds\nlocate at special positions of the global phase diagram for\nthe series of M substituted compounds. The competing\nmagnetic and superconducting phases found in our global\nphase diagram provide important clues on the possible\npairing mechanism in this class of materials.\nThe phase diagram is constructed from first-principles\ncalculations based on density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of PBE-type [10]\nfor the exchange-correlation potential.

The convergence of\ntotal energy calculations with respect to number of Kpoints and cut-off energy (of plane wave expansion) is well\nchecked, and final results are double checked using the\nfull-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW)\nmethod (WIN2K package) [12]. The series of LaOMAs\ncompounds with M ranging from V to Cu are all studied with full lattice optimizations using experimental 2\nFe cell, and the non-magnetic (NM), ferromagnetic (FM),\nand (intra-layer) antiferromagnetic states are treated. The\nsame approach has been also applied to LaOMP series,\nqualitatively same results are obtained, we therefore concentrate our following discussions on LaOMAs series for\nconsistence.\nAs shown in Table I, the optimized lattice parameters and internal coordinates for Fe and Ni compounds\nare in excellent agreement with available experimental\ndata [6\u20139], which demonstrates the quality of our present\ncalculations. The optimized parameters are used in our\ncalculations for all the compounds. Moving from V to Cu,\nthe lattice parameters are only slightly modified, despite\nof the dramatical change of number of 3d electrons (from\nd3 of V2+ to d9 of Cu2+ ), suggesting the less sensitivity of\nlattice distortion.\nFig.1 shows the phase diagram computed for the whole\nrange of compounds. The solid lines and the dashed lines\nrepresent the stabilization energies of FM and AF states\nrelative to NM solution, respectively. Two distinct phase\nregions can be identified: the dome below Fe gives AF\nground state, while the one around Co is ferromagnetic.\nThe computed magnetic moments (see Fig.1) show that\nthe left-hand side AF phase region are strongly spin polarized, while the magnetic moment of the ferromagnetic\nphase around Co is small, suggesting possibly different origins of two magnetic phase regions. It is important to note\nthat both LaOFeAs and LaONiAs are located at special\npositions of the phase diagram: Fe compound is at the\nborderline between the AF and FM phase regions; while\nNi compound is at the other border of the FM phase.\nThe overall phase diagram clearly suggests that the magnetic instabilities are crucially important to understand\nthe physical properties of this new family of compounds.\nThe present calcualtions are done based on experimental\ncrystal cell with 2 Fe per cell [8].

(b) The\ncorresponding magnetic moments obtained from calculations.\n\nstrong nesting effect exists particularly for LaOFeAs. This\nwill lead to\u221astripe-type\nspin-density-wave (SDW) ground\n\u221a\nstate with 2 \u00d7 2 super-cell structure. The detailed results for this SDW state will be presented in a separate\npaper combined with experimental results [13].\nTo understand the electronic structures, we show the total and projected density of states (DOS) of various compounds in Fig.2. Let's start from LaOFeAs (Fig.2(a)).\nThe states between -2eV and +2eV are mostly from Fe3d states, just below which are the states of O-p and As-p\n(from -6eV to -2eV). The p-d hybridization between O and\nFe is negligible, while that between As and Fe is sizable.\nThis As-M p-d hybridization is enhanced by changing to Ni\ncompound (see the projected DOS of Fig.2(b)). Since the\ntransition metal sites are coordinates by As-tetrahedron,\nthe crystal field will normally splits the five d orbitals into\nlow-lying two-folds eg states and up-lying three-folds t2g\nstates. However, the As-tetrahedron are actually much\ndistorted from its normal shape (squeezed along c by about\n20%). This distortion will further split the eg and t2g manifolds significantly making the final orbital distributions\ncomplicated. As the results, what actually happens is opposite to what we expect from simple tetrahedra crystal\nfield: the low-lying manifold is three folds and the higherlying manifold is two folds, between which a pseudo-gap\nabout 0.5eV exists. For Fe compound, the nominal number of d electrons is 6, and the low-lying three-fold bands\nare nearly fully occupied with the Fermi level Ef located\nvery close to the deep of the pseudo-gap. If the crystal field is strong enough, which may be achieved by the\nsubstitution of As atoms, a simple band-insulator will be\nexpected by enlarging the pseudo-gap. From the calculated DOS at Ef , we estimate the bare susceptibility and\nspecific heat coefficient, which are \u03c70 =7.6\u00d710\u22125 emu/mol\nand \u03b30 =5.5 mJ/K2 mol for Fe compound (see Table I for\n\n\fDoping-dependent Phase Diagram of LaOMAs (M=V\u2013Cu) and Electron-type Superconductivity near Ferromagnetic Instability\n6\n\nTotal\nFe-d\nO-p\nAs-p\n\n(a) Fe-NM\n4\n\n2\n\nDOS (States/eV spin f.u.)\n\nother compound). Taking the experimental susceptibility\nabout 50\u00d710\u22125 emu/mol at 300K, a renormalization factor about 6.6 is suggested, which is close to that shown in\nSr2 RuO4 [14].\nMoving to Mn compound, the half filled d-shell (about\nd5 ) will gain energy from the Hund's coupling, and the\nspin polarized states will be favored as the results. In reality, the calculated total energies of both FM and AF\nsolutions are much lower than that of NM solution (about\n0.3eV/f.u for the former and 0.55eV for the later). The\nreason why the AF solution is more favored is that a gap\nabout 0.2eV is opened in the AF solution (see Fig.2(e)).\nIt is mentioned (but without showing data) in the recent\nexperimental paper [6] that LaOMnP is a semiconductor. This is consistent with our prediction, and further\nwe show that the ground state of Mn compound is AF.\nThe calculated spin moment is about 3.1\u03bcB /Mn, which\nis much reduced from the expected 5\u03bcB /Mn of high spin\nstate. There are two possibilities to explain the reduced\nmoment. One is that Mn is in intermediate spin state\nrather than high-spin state. If this is the case, certain\nkinds of orbital ordering would be expected for an AF insulator. However, our calculated occupation numbers of\nprojected 3d-shell orbitals are quite uniform, suggesting\nthis possibility is unlikely. The second possibility is due\nto either p-d or d-d hybridization (particularly for narrow gap system). The calculated spin moment is about\n4.3\u03bcB /Mn for typical high-spin AF insulator MnO [15],\nwhere only the p-d hybridization is important. However,\nhere we point out that the Mn-Mn distance in LaOMnAs\nis about 2.8\u00c5, which is much shorter than what was found\nin MnO (about 3.2\u00c5), and is actually very close to the distance in elementary-Mn (about 2.6\u223c2.7\u00c5). The direct d-d\nhybridization will be much enhanced by such short distance, which will again reduce the moment. The effect of\ndirect d-d overlap has been addressed in previous study for\nLaOFeP [16], however we emphasize here that this is generally true for all the compounds of this family as shown\nby the optimized structure (Table I).\nThe stabilization of FM phase region at the right hand\nside has different origin as will be discussed here for LaOCoAs. Co has one more d electron than Fe, therefore the\nFermi level is lifted up and located above the pseudo-gap.\nWhat is interesting is that a strong Van-Hove singularity (VHS) is present just at the Fermi level of LaOCoAS\nNM DOS as shown in Fig.2(d). The high N(Ef ) in the\npresence of this VHS will push the system to be itinerant\nFM due to Stoner instability. This mechanism is further\nsupported by the following factors: (1) the FM region is\nrelatively narrow; (2) the polarized spin moment is small\n(about 0.5\u03bcB /Co); (3) the energy gain is also small (about\n35meV/f.u.). By adding one more electron, for LaONiAs,\nthe Fermi level is shifted away from the VHS, the system is\nrecovered to be NM again as shown in the phase diagram.\nHaving finished the discussions for the phase diagram\nand the general picture of the electronic structure, now let\nus focus on the LaOFeAs and LaONiAs, where supercon-\n\n0\n-6\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\nTotal\nMn-d\n\n(c) Mn-NM\n\n0\n-6\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n(e) Mn-AF\n\n2\nTotal\nMn-d\n\n2\n\n0\n-6\n6\n4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n2\nTotal\nCo-d\n\n0\n\n2\n\n(f) Co-FM\n\nTotal\nCo-d\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-6\n-6\n\n-4\n\n(d) Co-NM\n\n4\n\n0\n-6\n6\n\nTotal\nNi-d\nAs-p\n\n(b) Ni-NM\n\n-4\n\n-2\n0\nEnergy (eV)\n\n2\n\n-6\n-6\n\n-2\n0\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFig. 2: The calculated electron density of states (DOS) for\nvarious compounds in different states (see text part for explanation).\n\nductivity are discovered. Fig.3 gives the calculated band\nstructures and Fermi surfaces (FS) for both compounds\n(the window for d-bands is shown, and there are totally ten\nd bands in our unit cell). First of all, the band dispersions\nalong the z direction are all very weak suggesting the 2dimensional nature of those compounds. Considering the\nin-plane dispersions, the band structure of LaOFeAs can\nbe schematically separated into two parts. The bands below Ef are relative flat and have little contribution coming from the As-p states, while the bands above Ef are\nquite dispersive (except some flat branches around +1eV\nwhich corresponds to the VHS discussed above), and have\nlarge weight coming from the As-p character (as shown\nby the projected fat-bands plot). Those dispersive bands\nform electron-like FS cylinders around the M-A lines of\nthe Brillouin zone, and hole-like FS cylinders are formed\naround the \u0393-Z lines due to the Fermi level crossing of the\nbands from the lower part. For LaONiAs, all the flat bands\nare pushed down to below Fermi level, and only the dispersive bands remain to cross the Fermi level, which give\nthe large electron FS around M-A lines, but hole-type FS\naround X-R line instead of \u0393-Z.\nThe experimental results show that the LaOFeAs is superconducting only after electron-type F-doping [8], and\nalso the Tc of LaOFeP (which has very similar band struc-\n\n\fGang Xu et al.\nA phase of 3 He [18]. Our calculations shows that LaOFeAs\ncan be basically characterized as low density electron car1\nriers doped on top of a band insulator with filled d6 valence\n0\norbitals. In 3 He, the B phase is realized under the low or\n-1\nambient pressure condition while A phase is realized under\n-2\nhigh pressure condition close to solidification. By analogy,\nwe suggest that the low electron density system LaOFeAs\n2\n(b) Ni\nis in the weak coupling limit, which generally favors the\n1\nunitary, or B phase like, pairing symmetry. Upon fur0\nther increasing doping, the non-unitary A phase could be\n-1\nrealized. In two dimensions, unitary B state can be characterized as a state where the up (down) spin electrons\n-2\nare paired in the px + ipy (px \u2212 ipy ) state, so that the\nX\nM\nZ\nR\nZ\nA\n\u0393\n\u0393\nA\ntime reversal symmetry is preserved. This state is similar\nto the topologically non-trivial state, characterized by Z2\ninvariant [19], found in quantized spin-Hall insulator [20].\nIn contrast, the time reversal symmetry breaking A phase\n\u0393\ncould be realized in Sr2 RuO4 partly because the carriers\n\u0393\ndensity is high.\nA\nA\nThe topological nature of the proposed pairing state\nM\nX\nX\nM\nR\nR\nfor LaOFeAs implies the existence of counter-propagating\nA\nA\nedge states which can be tested experimentally.
