Each dollar spent in any\nplace of the world will sooner or later reinforce the roots of capitalism. In situation\nof the lack of such sound root, the effects of positive balance of payments can be\ndeposited only in foreign exchange reserves, to avoid immediate consumption. The\nmoney that cannot be spent can be called dead money. Global financial crisis has\nits cause in the outflow of money from the international financial network, towards\nthe monetary reserves of the systems which, having no sound capitalist roots, while\nenjoying high share in global trade, froze the assets in reserves. Under the impact\nof the crisis, the foreign exchange reserves held by above mentioned systems have\nstarted to shrink. Sooner or later, they will feed the roots of capitalism. The\nrevitalized and released dead money will result in growth of inflation in industrial\ncountries. This development will herald the end of financial crisis and the beginning\nof a new economic boom, since investors will start to buy up the shares in order to\ngain protection against inflation.\nReferences\n[1] E.
