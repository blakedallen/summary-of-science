Introduction\nWater vapor masers provide the only emission lines from\nthe accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that\ncan be spatially mapped. Our ability to image these objects comes about through the very high brightness provided by the maser process and the fortuitous location of\na line at 1.3 cm (22 GHz), at which wavelength we are able\nto image with submilliarcsecond resolution. Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI) images showed that, in\nthe LINER galaxy NGC 4258, the water vapor megamaser\narises in a thin, edge-on warped gaseous annulus between\ngalactocentric radii of 0.16\u20130.28 pc (Greenhill et al. 1995b;\nMiyoshi et al. 1995; Herrnstein et al. 1999). Maser emission is observed both near systemic velocity, arising from\nclouds at the near side of the disk, and from 'satellite lines'\nwith velocities \u223c\u00b1900 km s\u22121 w.r.t. systemic (Nakai et al.\n1993), arising from gas at the tangent points with rotational velocities directed towards and away from Earth.\nThe satellite lines show an accurately Keplerian rotation\ncurve implying a central mass of 3.9\u00d7107 M\u2299 . The reces-\n\nsional velocities of the near systemic features are observed\nto be increasing at a rate of \u223c9 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 (Haschick et\nal. 1994; Greenhill et al. 1995a; Nakai et al. 1995). This\nincrease in velocity is caused by the centripetal acceleration of clumps of gas in the annulus as they move across\nour line of sight to the central core (e.g. Greenhill et al.\n1994; Watson & Wallin 1994).\nIn this paper we report the detection of a luminous H2 O megamaser in the Sa LINER galaxy Mrk 1419\n(NGC 2960, UGC 05159), that appears to be quite similar\nto the maser in NGC 4258.\n\n2. Observations\nWe observed Mrk 1419 in the 616 \u2212 523 transition of H2 O\n(rest frequency: 22.23508 GHz) with the 100-m telescope\nof the MPIfR at Effelsberg1 on January 28 and 30, March\n12, May 7, December 15, 16, and 31, 2001, and on March\n5, 2002. The beam width was 40\u2032\u2032 . The observations were\nmade with a two channel K-band receiver in a dual beam\n1\n\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nchenkel@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de\n\nC.\n\nHenkel,\n\ne-mail:\n\nThe 100-m telescope at Effelsberg is operated by the MaxPlanck-Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie (MPIfR) on behalf of the\nMax-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG).\n\n\f2\n\nHenkel et al.: The water vapor megamaser in Mrk 1419\n\nFig. 1.

Results\nFig. 1 shows a characteristic 22 GHz H2 O spectrum of\nMrk1419, displaying the velocity interval from 4240 to\n5660 km s\u22121 . There are three groups of maser features:\nThe blue-shifted components are found between 4320\nand 4600 km s\u22121 , the red-shifted ones between 5200 and\n5550 km s\u22121 , and the systemic ones between 4820 and\n5000 km s\u22121 . Systemic line intensities are consistent with\nthe upper limit provided by Braatz et al. (1996). The\ntwo gaps devoid of line emission have widths of 200\u2013\n220 km s\u22121 .

An interpretation in\nterms of the NGC 4258-paradigm (H2 O emission from a\nKeplerian circumnuclear disk; see Sect. 1) is therefore suggestive. Detection of acceleration of the systemic features,\ncaused by centripetal acceleration at the front or back\nside of the putative edge-on disk, and the absence of such\na drift in the non-systemic features from the tangentially\nseen parts of the disk would provide independent evidence\nand would go a long way towards confirming an analogous\nmodel to that already established for NGC 4258.\n\nFig. 4.

Not accounting for (possibly small)\nbeaming angles, Mrk 1419 is thus one of the more luminous known H2 O megamasers. Some individual components show strong variability. The feature at \u223c5250 km s\u22121\n\u22121\nvaries in intensity by a factor >\n\u223c5; the \u223c5352.5 km s component (Fig. 4) was only detected in January 2001.\nOn January 28, 2001, we searched for maser emission\nin a wide velocity range, from 3430 to 6500 km s\u22121 . No\nsignificant very blue or red feature was detected at noise\nlevels of 7\u201310 mJy and channel spacings of 1.09 km s\u22121 .\n\n4. Discussion\nA comparison of Mrk 1419 with the best studied H2 O\nmegamaser source, NGC 4258, shows a striking similarity:\nin both galaxies, there are systemic features as well as red-,\nand blue-shifted groups of H2 O components that symmetrically bracket Vsys . Furthermore, accounting for a ratio of\n\nFig. 5 shows radial velocities for blue, systemic, and\nred features (as shown in Figs. 2\u20134, respectively) as a function of time. Our most sensitive spectra are from Jan. and\nDec. 2001. Connecting systemic features observed during\nboth epochs (dotted lines in Fig. 5, central panel) a positive drift is detected in each of a total of seven components. This is also shown in Fig. 3, where dotted lines connect the line peaks obtained from Gaussian fits. Velocities\nand standard deviations of these components are given\nin Table 1. Fits to the data lead to an acceleration of\n2.8\u00b10.5 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 , the error being the standard deviation of the mean. Assuming a normal error distribution, the likelihood of an acceleration <1.0 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 is\n\u223c10\u22124 . For all seven components the measured acceleration is larger than the sum of the related standard deviations (the scatter can be explained by groups of individual maser features with varying intensities (e.g. Genzel &\nDownes 1977)). The corresponding drift for the red- and\nblue-shifted components (\u20130.6\u00b10.3 km s\u22121 ) is not significant and the likelihood for an overall acceleration within\n|V\u0307drift |<1 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 is \u223c90%.\nHaving demonstrated that the systemic features likely\nshow a secular acceleration, while the red- and blue-shifted\ncomponents lack a similar drift, it makes sense to assume that the maser emission in Mrk 1419 arises from\nan almost edge-on circumnuclear annulus like that in\nNGC 4258. Assuming similar morphologies for NGC 4258\nand Mrk 1419, no interferometric data are needed to estimate the size of the disk and the mass enclosed (for equations, see e.g. Ishihara et al. 2001). Assuming that the\nsystemic emission arises (as in NGC 4258) from the near\nside of the inner edge of the annulus, where Keplerian\nvelocities are highest, the difference in velocity between\nsystemic and red- and blue-shifted features (see Figs. 2\u2013\n4) gives Vrot,in = 600\u00b120 km s\u22121 . Vrot,in , the velocity drift\nmentioned above, and an assumed inclination of 90\u25e6 then\nyield a radius Rin = 0.13\u00b10.03 pc for the inner edge of\n2\nthe disk (R\u221dVrot\n, so the disk would be smaller if the systemic features do not arise from the inner edge but farther\nout). For the outer edge with Vrot,out \u223c 330\u00b120 km s\u22121\n(Figs. 2\u20134), we then find Rout = (Vrot,in /Vrot,out )2 \u00d7 Rin\n\u223c 0.43\u00b10.08 pc. The full angular extent of the disk should\nthus not greatly exceed 2 mas (D=65 Mpc). Still assuming that the systemic features arise from the inner edge,\nthe binding mass and the mass density encircled by the\n\n\f4\n\nHenkel et al.: The water vapor megamaser in Mrk 1419\n\nFig. 5.

Concluding remarks\nAll four galaxies with (putative) circumnuclear H2 O\ndisks and reported velocity drift of the systemic emission\n(NGC 4258, Mrk 1419, NGC2639 (Wilson et al. 1995), and\nIC 2560 (Ishihara et al. 2001)) show galactic stellar disks\nseen at intermediate inclination. The (presumably) edgeon nuclear disks are therefore substantially inclined relative to the plane of the parent galaxies as has also been\ninferred for Seyfert galaxies from the orientation of their\nnuclear radio continuum ejecta (e.g. Ulvestad & Wilson\n1984). None of the sources shows negative acceleration,\na characteristic of emission from the far side of the disk.\nAlthough there may be no masers there, symmetry arguments suggest that instead, absorption in the vicinity of\nthe central engine blocks our view toward the back side\nof the circumnuclear disk. That red, blue, and systemic\nfeatures have similar intensities is unique to Mrk 1419,\nbut it is not yet possible to judge why the source is\ndifferent. Mrk 1419 should become an important target\nfor a direct determination of the geometric distance of a\ngalaxy approximately ten times as distant as NGC 4258\n(for NGC 4258, see Herrnstein et al. 1999, Maoz et al.\n1999). A measurement of the distance requires detailed\nmapping of the structure of the disk via VLBI. If a simple disk model can be established, the resulting distance\ncould then be used to check calibration of more common\n\noptical or near infrared distance indicators, thus helping\nto establish the cosmic distance scale reliant at least in\npart on geometric arguments.\nAcknowledgements.
