We observed a strong dependence between the magnetic state of the\nparticles and the field-dependent critical Ic(H) of these structures.\nPACS numbers: 74.50.+r, 75.75.+a, 75.60.-d\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRecent advances in microfabrication\ntechniques have increased the interest in\napplication of submicron sized patterned\nmagnetic elements. The prospective usage of\npatterned\nferromagnetic\nparticles\nof\nsubmicron sizes is accounted for by the well\ndefined local magnetic fields. In particular,\nmagnetic dots arrays can be used as artificial\npinning centers in a superconductor thin film.\nExperimental investigation of such a hybrid\nsuperconductor/ferromagnetic\nparticles\nsystem was begun in the last decade from\npioneer works of D. Givord et al. [1,2] and is\nunderway currently, for example [3,4].\nTransport properties of a superconducting\nlayer may also assist in determining the\nmagnetic states of a ferromagnetic particles\narray [2]. However, the magnetic mechanism\nof pinning in thin films works close to Tc,\nwhen\n\"natural\"\npinning\nforces\nare\ninsignificant [4,5]. Another way for\ncontrolling the superconducting state of a film\nby magnetic circuit is through modulating the\nsuperconducting order parameter and creating\n\nweak links [6]. This device can work as a\nsuperconductor switch.\nIn this paper, we present three novel\nhybrid structures: weak links - Josephson\njunctions (overlap and edge type) and a\nnarrow superconductor microbridge patterned\nby magnetic dots arrays. The influence of the\nparticle magnetization distribution on the\nstatic field-dependent critical current Ic(H) of\nthese structures has been investigated. All\nmeasurements were done at temperatures well\nbelow the superconducting transition.\nEDGE-TYPE JOSEPSON JUNCTION\nTheory. We propose to use the influence of\na stray magnetic field of nanoparticles on\nquantum interference in a Josephson junction.\nWe model a real structure as an infinite strip\nof superconductor cut by a narrow slot, see\nFig. 1. Assuming a sinusoidal current-phase\nrelationship, the field-dependent total current\nI(H) of the junction is expressed as\n\nI ( H ) = \u222b\u222b jc e i\u03c6 ( H ) dS ,\nS\n\n\f2\n\nz\n\nH\n\nj\ny\nx\nFig. 1. Schematic and SEM image of an edge-type Josephson junction with a chain of magnetic\nnanoparticles.\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the phase differences, jc is the\ncritical current density [7]. If the\nferromagnetic particles are placed near the\nbarrier, see Fig. 1, \u03c6 can be written as\n\u03c6 = \u03c6 ext + \u03c6 particle ,\nwhere \u03c6ext, \u03c6particle are the phase differences\ndue to the external magnetic field and the\nmagnetic field of the particles, respectively. It\nmeans that the magnetic field of the particles\ncan change the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern\nIc(H). We now assume that the spatial\ndistribution of the Josephson phase difference\n\u03c6(x) across the junction barrier can be written\nas\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n2\u03c0 \u039b\n(H + H\n=\n\u2202x\n\u03a60\n\np\n\n),\n\nwhere \u039b is the effective thickness of the\njunction (\u039b \u2248 2\u03bbL, \u03bbL is the London\npenetration depth), H is the external magnetic\nfield, Hp is the magnetic field induced by the\nmagnetic particles, \u03a60=hc/e=2\u22c510-7Oe\u22c5cm2 is\nthe magnetic flux quantum.\nIn particular, if the magnetic moment of a\nsingle particle in the chain has a uniform\ndistribution, Hp(x), \u03c6particle are periodic\nfunctions. The results of numeric simulation\nof Ic(H) for a junction with five dipoles is\nshown on Fig. 2a. In this case the field-\n\ndependent critical current should have a\nmaximum when the magnetic flux per period\nof the array of nanoparticles at the Josephson\njunction contains an integer number of flux\nquanta \u03a6d = n\u03a60, (\u03a6d = H\u039bd, n is integer).\nA more explicit model for this case confirmed\nthe same result [8].\nExperiment.\nFor\nexperimental\ninvestigation of the dependence of the\nparticles magnetization distribution on the\ncritical current we fabricated a series of\nNb\\SiNx\\Nb edge-type Josephson junctions\n[9] with chains of ferromagnetic Co\nnanoparticles with a typical lateral size of\n300-600 nm and a height of 25 nm (see\nFig. 1). Measurements of the critical current\nIc(H) were performed by a standard fourterminal method at T=4.2K, in the magnetic\nfield normal to the plane of the junction.\nThe particles were magnetized at room\ntemperature either by applying a magnetic\nfield of 20 kOe or by the MFM tip [10]. The\nmagnetic state of the nanoparticles was\ncontrolled by MFM before and after the low\ntemperature experiments.\nWe present two series of experiments.\n1). All particles were magnetized as dipoles\n(see inset on Fig. 2b) 2). All particles were\nmagnetized close to the vortex state.

In the case of the vortex magnetic\nstates of the particles, the resonance effects\nwere absent. This result is brought about by\nthe weak magnetic field induced by the\nparticles with a curling magnetization\ndistribution.\n\nmakes easier the entrance of the Abrikosov\nvortices. The particles array was fabricated on\nthe top of the junction, using electron beam\nlithography, see Fig. 3.\n\nOVERLAP JOSEPHSON JUNCTION\nThe basic idea of this experiment is to\ntrap a regular lattice of the Abrikosov vortices\nin the top electrode of the overlap junction\nperpendicularly to the junction surface. This\nis a unique way for controlling the properties\nof the overlap type junction because neither\nthe magnetic field induced by particles, nor\nthe aligned vortices trapped in both electrodes\naffect the phase differences, i.e., properties of\nthe junction. A special series of overlap\ngeometry junctions Nb\\Al\\AlOx\\Nb with a thin\ntop electrode (30 nm) was produced by IPHT\n(Jene, Germany). The width and length of the\njunctions is about 20 \u03bcm. The top electrode\nthickness is smaller than \u03bbL of the Nb, which\n\nFig. 3.

Dependence Ic(H) of the overlap junction with a) prevalence of dipoles states, b)\nprevalence of vortex magnetic states.\n\nexperiments. 1). About 80% of the particles\nwere magnetized as dipoles. 2). About 80% of\nthe particles were magnetized as vortices. The\nFraunhofer pattern for the vortex magnetic\nstate of the particles and for junction without\nparticles is the same, see Fig. 4a. The\ndiffraction pattern for the dipole magnetic\nstate of the dots has changed considerably,\nsee Fig. 4b. The critical current has been\nsuppressed; the form of the Fraunhofer\npattern has changed and become different\nfrom zero at a high magnetic field. There are\nno resonance effects that can be explained by\nthe absence of the regular vortex lattice. The\nresults observed in this experiment slightly\nresemble those obtained in a special\nexperiment for a single vortex motion [11].\nNARROW SUPERCONUCTOR\nMICROBRIDGE\nWe fabricated a series of 1 \u03bcm wide\nNb microbridges with the Nb thickness of\nabout 0.1 \u03bcm (\u0422\u0441~9 \u041a) and formed a chain of\nCo nanoparticles with a typical lateral size of\n300*600 nm and a height of 100 nm (Fig. 5a).\nThe remanent magnetic state of the particles\nis inhomogeneous; particles can be\nmagnetized to a uniform state by the field of\n500-1000 Gs [13]. The density of the critical\n\ncurrent for our Nb films is about 5 107 A/cm2,\nwhich implies deep centers of pinning [14].\nWe performed standard measurements\nof the critical current Ic(H) at T=4.2K in an\nexternal magnetic field normal to the plane of\nthe microbridge.\n\nFig. 5. SEM image of\nmicrobridges with\nferromagnetic nanoparticles.\n\nThe critical current dramatically\ndecreased with an increasing magnetic field\nand this dependence was the same for samples\nwith and without particles. If a magnetic field\nis applied in the plane of a particle-free\nmicrobridge (up to 2.5 kOe), the critical\ncurrent remains unaffected. For a microbridge\nwith magnetic particles we observed the\n\n4\n\n\f5\n\nIc, mA\n\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nH, kOe\nFig. 6. Dependence Ic(H) of the microbridge\nwith ferromagnetic nanoparticles.\n\nfollowing effects, see Fig. 6: enhancement of\nthe critical current Ic to 20% with an\nincreasing magnetic field H; strong\ndependence of the critical current on the\nmagnetic field sign, the difference between\nIc(H) and Ic(-H) reached 70% (\"diode effect\").\nIn addition, the critical current has a\nperiodical component with a period about 500\nOe, see Fig. 6.\nToday we do not have a clear\nunderstanding of the mechanism behind the\nmagnetic particles effect on the critical\ncurrent of a microbridge, all existing\nhypotheses have some imperfections. It seems\nimportant, though, that our Nb film is\npolycrystalline and features a high density of\nthe critical current, and the microbridge of our\nmake is narrow, which determines the\nboundary condition for entrance of the\nvortices.\nCONCLUSION\nWe investigated novel types of hybrid\nstructures composed of ferromagnetic\nnanoparticles on superconductor, which can\nbe used without control of the temperature.\nThe transport properties of superconductors\nare well controlled by the magnetic state of\n\nthe particles. For the case of the edge-type\nJosephson junction a simple model of the\ninfluence produced by magnetic particles is\nproposed. The experiments confirmed\nsusceptibility of the Josephson junctions to\nthe magnetic state of nanoparticles, which can\nbe used in low temperature electronic devices.\nThe experimental results obtained in the\nstudy of overlap geometry junction and\nnarrow microbridge are novel, and there is no\ntheory interpreting these effects nowadays.\nHowever, the observed effects are interesting\nboth from the fundamental point of view and\nfor prospective application.\nThis work was supported by the RFBR,\nGrant number 03-02-16774, 04-02-16827, 0402-17048 and INTAS, Grant number 03-516426, 03-51-4778.\nREFERENCE\n[1] Y.
