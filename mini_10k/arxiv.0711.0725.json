T CrB is the first recurrent nova to be detected in the\nhard-X-ray band (E \u223c 40.0 keV) during quiescence. The X-ray spectrum is\nconsistent with cooling-flow emission emanating from an optically thin region in\nthe boundary layer of an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The detection\nof strong stochastic flux variations in the light curve supports the interpretation\nof the hard X-ray emission as emanating from a boundary layer.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSymbiotic stars are binary systems in which a compact object accretes from red\ngiant, the wind of which forms a dense nebula around the binary. The nebula\nis ionized by the hot compact source, which is usually a white dwarf (Kenyon\n1986). Among the known symbiotic stars (Belczy\u0144ski et. al. 2000), four objects\nhave shown recurrent nova (RN) eruptions: T CrB, RS Oph, V3890 Sgr and\nV745 Sco. These eruptions are triggered by a thermonuclear runaway on the\nwhite dwarf (WD) surface after accretion of a critical amount of H rich material\nfrom the companion.\nOrio et al. (2001) suggested that during quiescence, the X-ray emission\nfrom RN could originate in the boundary layer of an accretion disc that was\nreconstructed around the WD after the outburst. Therefore, X-ray observations should allow one to determine a lower limit for the accretion rate. The\nlow X-ray luminosity measured in 350 novae and recurrent novae in quiescence\n(Orio et al. 2001) imply a low accretion rate, inconsistent with the observed\nrecurrence times. For example, in the case of RS Oph (Orio 1993), the short\nrecurrence time of \u223c20 years requires an accretion rate of \u223c10\u22128 M\u2299 /yr, inconsistent with measured X-ray fluxes. This inconsistency is known as the \"missing\nboundary layer problem\".\nT CrB is a well known recurrent nova with recorded outbursts in 1866\nand 1946. Its quiescent-state hard X-ray emission (Emax \u223c 100 keV) was\nfirst revealed during a 9 month Swif t survey (Tueller et al 2005).

(2007), who\nreported highly absorbed emission that was well fit with a cooling flow model\nwith kTmax =23.1 keV. The absorber consisted of components that both fully\ncovered and partially covered the hard X-ray source. Here we describe Suzaku\nX-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) observations of the recurrent nova T CrB performed on September 6, 2006.\n2.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nOn September 6th 2006, the Astro-E2/Suzaku X-ray observatory performed a\n46 ks (GO) observation of T CrB (ObsId 401043010 start time 22:44:21 UT).\nWe reduced the data according to standard procedures1 using the software package HEASOFT 6.22 . After determining the XIS background count rate from a\nnearby blank region, we extracted spectra and light curves for the XIS and HXD\ndetectors. We extracted two sets of light curves for each detector \u2013 one with a\nbin size of 360 s (used to search for stochastic bright variations) and the other\ngrouping photons every 8 s. We used the light curve with the smaller time bins\nfor power spectrum analysis.\n3.\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis and Results\nSpectral analysis\n\nVisual inspection of the extracted spectrum showed prominent Fe lines around\n\u223c6.5 keV. As these lines are an indication of the presence of thermal emission from a plasma with temperatures \u223c107\u22128 K, we first attempted to fit the\nspectrum with a single-temperature plasma plus neutral absorption. But no\nsatisfactory fit was obtained. Even using more complex absorbers, such as an\nabsorber that only partially covers the source, or absorption from an ionized\nplasma, did not produce acceptable fits. We did, however, find acceptable fits\n(\u03c72 =1.07) for a multi-temperature, cooling flow plasma model (mkcf low). The\nmodel required a complex absorber consisting of one absorbing system that fully\n22 cm\u22122 , which includes interstellar\ncovered the source [nH (full) = 17.819.2\n16.6 \u00d7 10\n22\n\u22122\nabsorption of 0.047\u00d710 cm ] and and another that only partially covered the\n22 cm\u22122 , partial covering fraction of 0.680.72 ].\nsource [nH (partial) = 35.642.2\n0.66\n32.3 \u00d710\nThe minimum temperature of the cooling-flow model is consistent with the smallest value allowed by the mkcflow model (kT =0.0808 keV), and the maximum\ntemperature is kT =57.468.3\n48.0 keV. We also added a gaussian emission-line profile\nto the model to account for the Fe K\u03b1 fluorescence line. Figure 1 shows the\nspectra from the XIS and HXD detectors, with the cooling-flow model overplotted. To estimate the parameters for the Fe lines, we used a simple powerlaw\nfit to establish the continuum level, and then fit the Fe K\u03b1, Fe XXV and Fe\nXXVI emission lines with three Gaussian profiles (see fig. 1, right panel). The\n153\n137\nequivalent widths obtained were 185187\n183 , 135134 and 151149 eV respectively.\n1\n2\n\nhttp://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/analysis/\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/\n\n\f3\n\nHigh energy X-ray emission from recurrent novae\n1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nCounts sec keV\n\nCounts sec keV\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nFe K\u03b1\n\nFe XXV\n\nFe XXVI\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n0.0001\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n\n10\n\n40\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nFigure 1.

The fractional\namplitude of the stochastic variations, represented as the ratio between the\nmeasured rms variation, s, and that expected from Poisson fluctuations alone,\nsexp , is 3.75. In the case of HXD light curve, no stochastic variations were found\nabove the Poisson level. Although by eye there appears to be a periodic (or quasiperiodic) variation in the light curve at a period of around 100 minutes, we did\nnot detect a statistically significant oscillation at this period in our preliminary\nLomb-Scargle analysis (taking into account the underlying broadband continuum\npower) of the XIS and HXD light curves.\n1.6\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n1.4\n\nFigure 2. Mean normalized XIS light\ncurve (all four detectors added) with a 360\ns bin size. The plot shows the flux as a\nfunction of time in the energy range 0.312.0 keV. The X-ray emission is clearly\nvariable on a time scale of minutes.\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0\n\n4.\n\n20000\n40000\n60000\n80000\nTime since 2006-09-06 22:44:21 [s]\n\n1e+05\n\nDiscussion\n\nHard X-ray emission with energy up to 100 keV is observed from the dwarf\nnova SS Cyg in quiescence (Barlow et al. 2006). Dwarf novae observed with\nXMM-N ewton in quiescence also display spectra with energies up to \u223c12 keV\n(Pandel et al. 2005). For low accretion rates (< 3\u00d710\u22129 M\u2299 /yr), Narayan & Popham\n\n\f4\n\nLuna et al.\n\n(1993) showed that the most internal part of an accretion disc around a 1 M\u2299\nWD, the boundary layer, radiates as an optically thin plasma at \u223c 10 keV. The\nhardness of the X-ray emission detected from T CrB strongly suggest that it\ncomes from the accretion region closest to the WD. From the spectral model\nfitted, the accretion rate is \u1e40 \u223c4.2\u00d710\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (d/1 kpc)2 . The detection\nof rapid flickering, which typically emanates from regions close to the WD, supports an accretion origin for the detected emission. Moreover, the cooling-flow\nspectral model, as with boundary layer emission from non-magnetic cataclysmic\nvariables (CVs; Mukai et al. 2003) and other accreting high-mass white dwarfs\n(Luna & Sokoloski 2007; Smith et al. 2007), provides a natural context for the\nflickering.\nThe EW of the neutral Fe K\u03b1 line suggests that the X-ray source is surrounded by large amounts of neutral material (Inoue 1985). Reflection of radiation off of the WD surface can also contribute to the formation of this line. From\nGeorge & Fabian (1991), the EW of the Fe K\u03b1 line when a 2\u03c0 source reflects\nbremsstrahlung photons with \u223c10 keV is 100-200 eV. Therefore the intense Fe\nK\u03b1 line is consistent either with large amounts of neutral material, as with RT\nCru and CD -57 3057 (Luna & Sokoloski 2007; Smith et al. 2007; Kennea et al.\n2007), or with reflection from the surface of the WD.\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing the Suzaku X-ray satellite, we observed hard-X-ray emission from the\nrecurrent nova T CrB in quiescence. Assuming that a more detailed timing\nanalysis confirms the lack of periodic variations, the presence of flickering on\na timescale of minutes and the cooling-flow type spectrum suggest that the\naccretion onto the WD proceeds through a disc with an optically thin boundary\nlayer. T CrB is the first recurrent nova to show hard-X-ray emission from a\nboundary layer during quiescence.\nAcknowledgments. G. J. M. Luna acknowledge CNPq and CAPES/PROEX\nsupport. J. L.
