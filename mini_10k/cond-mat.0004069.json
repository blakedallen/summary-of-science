Consequently, we believe that the question about the existence of the finite-T VG transition is\nnot resolved yet. To our knowledge, a detailed numerical\nstudy of transport properties of 2D gauge glass model\nhas not been performed: Existing RSJ studies18,19,21 did\nnot consider the finite-size scaling in a proper way and\nin some of them18,19 the temperature range used did not\ncover the expected transition temperature (Tc \u2248 0.22 in\nRefs. 16 and 21, and Tc \u2248 0.15 in Ref. 20).\nIn this paper, we use RSJ dynamic simulation to investigate the resistive transition in the 2D XY gauge glass\nmodel in the absence of external currents. Since the voltage is always nonzero in the presence of a finite current\nbecause of the nucleation process, vanishing of the linear\nresistance, which is defined in the limit of zero external\ncurrent, is the appropriate definition of a superconductor. The fluctuating twist boundary condition (FTBC)\nfor Langevin-type dynamic simulation24 made it possible\nto calculate the linear resistance with preserved periodicity of the phase variables (similar methods have also\nbeen used in Ref. 25). We here use FTBC to calculate\nthe linear resistances, and then, through the standard\nfinite-size scaling analysis (see, e.g., Refs. 2 and 26), a\nresistive transition at a finite temperature is concluded.\nThe Hamiltonian of the 2D L \u00d7 L XY gauge glass\nmodel subject to FTBC is written as24,27,28\nX\ncos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j \u2212 rij * \u2206 \u2212 Aij ),\n(1)\nH = \u2212J\n\nSince the prediction of the vortex glass (VG) phase\nin the high-Tc materials,1,2 the properties and the existence of VG phase have drawn intensive interest for a\ndecade.3\u201323 In experiments3\u20137 the VG phase has a significant practical importance since the high-Tc materials\ncan be truly superconducting in this phase where vortices are completely frozen at random positions, while\nthe Abrikosov vortex lattice in pure type-II superconductors dissipate energy at any amount of external currents.\nTo study VG from a theoretical point of view simplified\ndiscretized models such as the XY gauge glass and the\nXY spin glass have been widely used. For the gauge\nglass model, there is a growing consensus that the low\ncritical dimension is less than 3, which means that there\nexists VG phase at finite temperatures in three dimensions (3D). This has been confirmed by the defect wall\nenergy calculations at zero temperature8\u201311 as well as\nby finite-temperature simulations.12\u201314 Although the issue about the validity of using the gauge glass model to\ndescribe real bulk high-Tc materials is not completely settled (e.g., the former is isotropic with a vanishing net external magnetic field, while the latter is anisotropic with\nnonzero net magnetic field), experiments on high-Tc materials like YBCO3\u20135 and BiSCCO6,7 also have yielded\nresults in accordance with the existence of a VG phase\nat finite temperatures.\nIn 2D, all existing defect wall energy calculations have\nunanimously revealed that the stiffness exponent has a\nnegative value,9,11,15 which has been confirmed in Ref. 16\nthrough a simple argument but has been interpreted as\nan artifact of ubiquitous spin wave fluctuations. Finitetemperature simulations have so far yielded contradicting results: On the one hand, zero-temperature transition has been concluded from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations in earlier studies13,15,17 and from the currentvoltage (IV ) characteristics in resistively-shunted junction (RSJ) simulations.18,19 On the other hand, there\nhave been evidences of the finite-temperature transition\nfrom the IV characteristics20 and from the divergence of\nthe relaxation time scale21 in RSJ dynamic simulations,\nand from the very recent extensive finite-temperature\n\nhiji\n\nwhere J is the Josephson coupling strength, the summa1\n\n\ftion is over all nearest neighboring bonds, and \u03b8i (with\nperiodicity \u03b8i = \u03b8i+Lx\u0302 = \u03b8i+L\u0177 ) is the phase of the superconducting order parameter at site i. The twist variable \u2206 = (\u2206x , \u2206y ) measures the global twist of phase\nvariables in each direction, and rij (= x\u0302, \u0177) is the unit\nvector from site i to the nearest-neighbor site j (the lattice spacing is taken to be unity). The XY gauge glass\nmodel is characterized by the quenched random variable\nAij uniformly distributed in [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0), whereas in the XY\nspin glass model Aij can have binary values 0 and \u03c0 with\nequal probability. Recently XY spin glass model draws\nattention in relation to the \u03c0-junctions due to the d-wave\nsymmetry of order parameters.\nThe equations of motion for RSJ dynamics subject to\nFTBC are determined from the local and the global current conservations and are written in dimensionless forms\n(see Refs. 24 and 28 for details): For phase variables\n\u03b8\u0307i = \u2212\n\nX\nj\n\nGij\n\nX\u2032\n\nRx =\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0015\ndthVx (t)Vx (0)i\n\n(4)\n\nwith the disorder average [* * *] and the voltage across the\nwhole sample Vx = \u2212L\u2206x , which is then approximated\nas31\nRx \u2248\n\n\u0003\nL2 1 \u0002\n[\u2206x (\u0398) \u2212 \u2206x (0)]2 ,\n2T \u0398\n\n(5)\n\nfor sufficiently large \u0398. For convenience, we define\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\nL2 [\u2206x (\u0398) \u2212 \u2206x (0)]2 + [\u2206y (\u0398) \u2212 \u2206y (0)]2\nf (\u0398) \u2261\n2T\n2\n(6)\nand calculate the linear resistance R from the leastsquare fit to the form f (\u0398) = R\u0398.\nWe plot in Fig. 1 for L = 6 at T = 0.22 (a) the time\nevolution of L\u2206y for a given disorder realization, and (b)\nf (\u0398) obtained from the average over 200 samples. The\nfull line in Fig. 1(b) obtained from the fit determines the\nvalue of R. Figure 2 shows R obtained in this way as\na function of L at T = 0.30, 0.25, 0.23, 0.22, 0.21, 0.20,\nand 0.15. For each L and T , we divided the total number\nof samples, Ns , into five groups, each of which contains\nNs /5 samples, and R was calculated for each group, leading to the estimation of error bars (standard deviations)\nin Fig. 2. The linear resistance shows clear change of curvature around T \u2248 0.22: In the high-temperature regime\nR appears to saturate as L is increased, while in the lowtemperature regime R drops down more rapidly as L is\nincreased. To see this behavior more clearly, we also display in the inset of Fig. 2 R(T = 0.15)/R(T = 0.30) as\na function of L in log scales, which does not exhibit any\nsign of saturation in terms of L: On the contrary, the\ndownward curvature implies that in the thermodynamic\nlimit R(T = 0.15) vanishes. These observations lead to\nthe conclusion that the 2D XY gauge glass model has\nthe finite-temperature resistive transition.\nTo obtain more precise value of Tc , we proceed to the\nfinite-size scaling analysis of the linear resistance. In the\ndynamic scaling theory for the usual second-order phase\ntransition in 2D,2 the linear resistance has the standard\nfinite-size scaling form:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(7)\nR(L, T ) = L\u2212z \u03c1 (T \u2212 Tc )L1/\u03bd ,\n\n[sin(\u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8k \u2212 rjk * \u2206 \u2212 Ajk ) + \u03b7jk ],\n\nk\n\n(2)\nwhere Gij is the 2D square lattice Green's function and\nthe primed summation is over four nearest neighbors k\nof site j, while for the twist variables\n \u0307 = \u2212 1 \u2202H + \u03b7\u2206 .\n\u2206\nL2 \u2202\u2206\n\n1\n2T\n\n(3)\n\nThe thermal noise terms satisfy h\u03b7ij i = h\u03b7\u2206 i =\nh\u03b7ij \u03b7\u2206 i = h\u03b7\u2206x \u03b7\u2206y i = 0 and\nh\u03b7ij (t)\u03b7kl (0)i = 2T \u03b4(t)(\u03b4ik \u03b4jl \u2212 \u03b4il \u03b4jk ),\n2T\nh\u03b7\u2206x (t)\u03b7\u2206x (0)i = h\u03b7\u2206y (t)\u03b7\u2206y (0)i = 2 \u03b4(t),\nL\nwhere h* * *i is the thermal average, and the time t and\nthe temperature T have been normalized in units of\nh\u03042 /4e2 R0 J with the shunt resistance R0 , and J/kB , respectively. The equations of motion were integrated\nnumerically by using the efficient second-order RungeKutta-Helfand-Greenside algorithm29 with the discrete\ntime step \u2206t = 0.05. For each disorder realization we\nneglected an initial stage of the time evolution up to t0 ,\nand the measurements were made between t0 and t0 +tm .\nFor L = 4, 6, 8, and 10, disorder averages were performed\nover Ns = 400, 200, 100, 50 samples, respectively. We\nverified that t0 = 106 and tm = 5 \u00d7 106 (corresponding to\n108 time steps) were sufficiently large; it is more important to increase the number of sample averages to have\nmore reliable results than increasing tm further. The\nhighest temperature T = 0.30 in the present work corresponds to the lowest temperature in Ref. 18, and this\nmakes it necessary to use much larger value of tm than\nin Ref. 18 [by factor O(102 )].\nThe linear resistance in x direction is given by the\nNyquist formula:30\n\nwhere \u03c1(x) is the scaling function with the scaling variable x, z is the dynamic critical exponent, and the static\ncritical exponent \u03bd is defined by the divergence of the correlation length, i.e., \u03be \u223c |T \u2212 Tc |\u2212\u03bd . At T = Tc , R \u223c L\u2212z\n[see Eq. (7)] and from Fig. 2 we obtain z \u2248 2.0. Although\nthis value is much smaller than the values usually measured in experiments (z = 4 \u223c 9), it should be noted\nthat the similar values have also been observed in various numerical simulations with RSJ dynamics and MC\ndynamics of 2D gauge glass model (z \u2248 2.2 in Ref. 20 and\n2\n\n\fz \u2248 2.4 in Ref. 16, respectively) as well as the Langevintype relaxational dynamics of vortices in the presence of\nquenched impurities (z \u2248 2.1, Ref. 23). Furthermore, a\nrecent analytic calculation based on the dynamic renormalization group method also has found z = 2 for 2D\ngauge glass model with a purely relaxational equations of\nmotion.22 In contrast, widely believed zero-temperature\ntransition in 2D gauge glass model implies that the linear\nresistance should have Arrhenius form and thus corresponds to z = \u221e. We also tried to fit our data in Fig. 2\nto the Arrhenius form18,19 (see Fig. 3) and found that\nthe thermal activation barrier, which is proportional to\nthe slopes in Fig. 3, strongly depends on the system size.\nFurthermore, R is found to deviate from the Arrhenius\nform in a systematic way at the lowest temperature at\nall system sizes.\nFigure 4 shows the scaling plot Eq. (7) with z = 2.0,\nTc = 0.22, and \u03bd = 1.2. We tried to vary parameter\nvalues used in the scaling plot and concluded\nTc = 0.22(2),\nz = 2.0(1),\n\u03bd = 1.2(2),\n\nstrong evidence of the finite-temperature resistive transition at Tc = 0.22(2) with the dynamic critical exponent\nz = 2.0(1) and the static exponent \u03bd = 1.2(2). However,\nthe nature of this finite-temperature resistive transition\nneeds to be investigated more in detail.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author is grateful to Prof. Petter Minnhagen\nfor useful discussions.

It is worth mentioning that the same method\n(calculation of the linear resistance with FTBC accompanied by the finite-size scaling analysis) has lead to a\nvery precise determination of Tc in 3D XY model.28 In\nrecent studies of 2D XY gauge glass model based on the\nsame RSJ dynamics,18,19 the finite-size scaling analysis\nhas not been used and the temperature range did not\ncover the critical temperature (Tc \u2248 0.22), leading to the\ndifferent conclusion of the zero-temperature transition.\nRecently, the possibility of the quasi-long-range glass\norder with the vanishing glass order parameter32 in 2D\ngauge glass model has been suggested in Ref. 16, where it\nhas been argued that the correlation length \u03be diverges in\nthe whole low-temperature phase. Although our scaling\nplot in Fig. 4 was obtained on the assumption of the usual\nsecond order transition, where \u03be is finite both below and\nabove Tc , it is still plausible to have the quasi-long-range\nglass order: In this case, the quasi-criticality should be\nreflected in the temperature-dependent dynamic critical\nexponent below Tc with R(L, T ) \u223c L\u2212z(T ) , while the\nhigh-temperature phase still obeys the scaling form in\nEq. (7). Our current results cannot rule out this possibility, and if we neglect the smallest size L = 4 in Fig. 2,\nR in the low-temperature phase indeed appears to exhibit the simple algebraic form R \u223c L\u2212z with increasing\nz as T is decreased, in accord with the idea of the quasilong-range glass order.\nIn conclusion, we studied numerically the resistive\ntransition in the 2D XY gauge glass model by using\nthe RSJ dynamic equations subject to the fluctuating\ntwist boundary condition. The standard finite-size scaling analysis applied to the linear resistances lead to the\n3\n\n\f14\n\nK. H. Lee and D. Stroud, Phys. Rev. B 44, 9780 (1991); C.\nWengel and A. P.
