At zeroth order the model yielded degenerate neutrinos and a generalized \"tribimaximal\"\nmixing matrix. At first order the mass splitting was incorporated and the tribimaximal mixing matrix emerged with very small corrections but with a zero value for the parameter s13 . In the present\npaper a different, assumed weaker, perturbation is included which gives a non zero value for s13 and\nfurther corrections to other quantities. These corrections are worked out and their consequences\ndiscussed under the simplifying assumption that the conventional CP violation phase vanishes. It\nis shown that the existing measurements of the parameter s23 provide strong bounds on s13 in this\nmodel.\nPACS numbers: 14.60.Pq, 12.15.F, 13.10.+q\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt present, the particle physics community is planning, as a follow-up to the enormously important experiments of\nthe last decade [1]-[7], an extensive program with the goal of more accurately understanding the neutrino masses and\nmixings. There is really no accepted theory for an a priori prediction of these quantities. Hence it seems worthwhile\nto investigate in detail various theoretical models to develop plausible scenarios which might be tested.\nHere we look more closely at a particular model presented in [8] and further studied in [9] and in [10]. That model\nassumed an initial permutation symmetry (S3 ) which is motivated by the fact that the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix which transforms\nthe defining representation to irreducible form is, up to a single parameter rotation, the same as the \"tribimaximal\"\nmatrix, which is in, at least, rough agreement with the present experimental situation. The tribimaximal form is\ntaken to be:\n\uf8eb \u22122 1\n\uf8f6\n\u221a\n\u221a\n0\n\uf8ec 6 3\n\uf8f7\nKT BM = \uf8ed \u221a16 \u221a13 \u221a12 \uf8f8 \u2261 R.\n(1)\n\u221a1\n6\n\n\u221a1\n3\n\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2\n\nThe assumption was also made that, at zeroth order, the three neutrinos are degenerate. It may be seen from Table\nI of [8] that this is plausible for a large range of possible fits to the data. However such an assumption at first seems\ninconsistent with permutation symmetry which suggests two of the three neutrinos to be degenerate (however not\nthe two \"solar\" neutrinos) and different in mass from the third. The proposed solution to this problem called for\nthe introduction of a Majorana type phase, which does not affect the usual neutrino oscillations but does affect the\nrate for neutrinoless double beta decay. The complications involved in obtaining a suitable Higgs scheme for both\nthe neutrino mass matrix and the charged lepton mass matrix (which can be arranged to be proportional to the unit\nmatrix) in this approach are discussed in some detail in [8].\nOf course, many interesting different models for neutrinos based on permutation symmetry have been discussed\nfor a long time [11]- [17]. In addition, many interesting models with similar approaches to the tribimaximal mixing\nmatrix have been vigorously pursued [18] -[30].\nIn the model under present discussion, the zeroth order piece of the prediagonal Majorana neutrino mass matrix\nhas the well known S3 invariant form:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 0 0\n1 1 1\nM\u03bd = \u03b1 \uf8f0 0 1 0 \uf8fb + \u03b2 \uf8f0 1 1 1 \uf8fb \u2261 \u03b11 + \u03b2d.\n(2)\n0 0 1\n1 1 1\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nEmail: rjora@ifae.es\nEmail: schechte@phy.syr.edu\nEmail: mnshahid@phy.syr.edu\n\n\f2\nHere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are, in general, complex numbers while d is usually called the \"democratic\" matrix. As discussed in\ndetail in [10] and [8], we take\n\u03b1 = \u2212i|\u03b1|e\u2212i\u03c8/2 ,\n\n(3)\n\n0 < \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c0.\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the physical phase \u03c8 lies in the range:\n\nFor the assumed initial degeneracy, |\u03b1| is related to \u03b2, assumed real, by:\n|\u03b1| =\n\n3\u03b2\n.\n2sin(\u03c8/2)\n\n(5)\n\nThe two zeroth order parameters are the degenerate neutrino masses, |\u03b1| and the phase \u03c8 which contributes to the\nneutrinoless double beta decay amplitude.\nThe first order perturbation treated in [9] and [10] is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0 0\n\u2206=\uf8ed0 t u\uf8f8\n(6)\n0 u t\nwhere t and u are parameters. In general, t and u may be complex but they were assumed real for simplicity. This\nperturbation is well known as the \"mu-tau\" symmetry [31]-[33]. The assumed zeroth order degeneracy (which actually\nmay be relaxed, if desired) forces us to use degenerate perturbation theory. Then \u2206 turns out (eg, section II of [10])\nto be the only possible choice which forces the desired tribimaximal form (as opposed to the generalized tribimaximal\nform) of the first order mixing matrix.\nHere we will choose for the second order perturbation, the matrix:\n\uf8eb \u2032 \u2032 \uf8f6\nt u 0\n(7)\n\u2206\u2032 = \uf8ed u\u2032 t\u2032 0 \uf8f8 .\n0 0 0\nFor simplicity we again consider the parameters, t\u2032 and u\u2032 to be real.\nNote that this second order perturbation preserves the S2 subgroup which involves the 1-2 interchange. One might\nwonder about also including a perturbation, \u2206\u2032\u2032 which preserves the 1-3 S2 subgroup. However, that is not expected\nto give anything new since the combination of Eqs.(2), (6) and (7) already has the same number of parameters as the\nmost general symmetric matrix, M\u03bd .\nThe combination of Eqs.(2), (6) and (7) was motivated by the group theory treatment of the strong interactions\nbefore QCD which led for example to the Gell-Mann Okubo mass formula [34]. In that case the initial term was\nflavor SU(3) invariant, the next term was invariant under the SU(2) isospin subgroup while the smallest last term\nwas invariant under the SU(2) \"U-spin\" subgroup. In the present case the zeroth order term has the discrete group\nS3 invariance and two different S2 subgroups are left invariant by the two perturbations.\nII.\n\nPERTURBATION ANALYSIS\n\nIn [10] we diagonalized the needed symmetric matrix:\nRT (\u03b11 + \u03b2d + \u2206)R =\n\u221a\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2\nt\n+\nu\n0\n3 (t + u)\n\u221a\n\u03b11 + \uf8ed 2 (t + u) 3\u03b2 + 2 (t + u) 0 \uf8f8 .\n3\n3\n0\n0\nt\u2212u\n\n(8)\n\nThe diagonalization of this matrix gave the first order neutrino mixing matrix, K (1) as\nK (1) = RR1 ,\nwhere,\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8ec \u221a\nR1 \u2248 \uf8ed \u2212 2 (t + u)\n9\u03b2\n0\n\n\u221a\n2\n9\u03b2 (t\n\n+ u) 0\n\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8.\n1\n\n(10)\n\nThis results in a diagonalization with complex eigenvalues.

Then the sum of the modified three\nentries will vanish in accordance with the requirement that there be only two independent Majorana phases.

However, the lepton\nnumber conserving neutrino oscillations can not depend on a Majorana phase [35]. As a check of this we see that the\nphase \u03c8 cancels out when one considers the mass differences,\n9\nA \u2261 m22 \u2212 m21 \u2248 3\u03b2(t + u) + \u03b2t\u2032 ,\n2\n7\n2\n2\nB \u2261 m3 \u2212 m2 \u2248 \u03b2(\u22125t + u) \u2212 \u03b2( t\u2032 + 2u\u2032 ),\n2\nC \u2261 m23 \u2212 m21 \u2248 2\u03b2(\u2212t + 2u) + \u03b2(t\u2032 \u2212 2u\u2032 ).\n\n(20)\n\nOf course, A, B and C are not independent.

In the literature some works specify A and |B| while others specify A and |C|.\nThe following best fit values for the perturbation parameters \u03b2t and \u03b2u were given in the first order treatment [10]:\n\nm21\n\n\f5\n\n\u03b2t \u2248 \u22124.13 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV 2 ,\n\u03b2u \u2248 4.39 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV 2 , T ype1\n\u03b2t \u2248 4.21 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV 2 ,\n\u03b2u \u2248 \u22123.94 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV 2\nIII.\n\nT ype2.\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nELEMENTS OF THE MIXING MATRIX\n\nWe employ the following parameterization [36] of the leptonic mixing matrix, K:\n\uf8f6\nc12 c13\ns12 c13\ns13 e\u2212i\u03b3\nK = \uf8ed \u2212s12 c23 \u2212 c12 s13 s23 ei\u03b3 c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s13 s23 ei\u03b3 c13 s23 \uf8f8 P,\ns12 s23 \u2212 c12 s13 c23 ei\u03b3 \u2212c12 s23 \u2212 s12 s13 c23 ei\u03b3 c13 c23\n\uf8eb\n\n(25)\n\nwhere c12 is short for cos\u03b812 for example. P is the diagonal matrix of Majorana type phases given in Eqs.(17) and\n(18) for the present model. For simplicity we are presently neglecting the conventional CP violation and thus setting\n\u03b3 = 0. To specify s12 , s13 and s23 , it is clearly sufficient to compare the (1-2), (1-3) and (2-3) matrix elements of K\nin Eq.(25) with those calculated in Eq.(16). This yields:\n2 t+u\n1\n1 t\u2032 + u \u2032\ns12 c13 = \u221a \u2212 \u221a\n+\u221a\n,\n3\n3 9\u03b2\n3 9\u03b2\n1 t\u2032 + u \u2032\n1 t\u2032 \u2212 2u\u2032\n\u2212\u221a\n,\ns13 = \u2212 \u221a\n2 2 t \u2212 2u\n2 9\u03b2\n1 t\u2032 \u2212 2u\u2032\n1 t\u2032 + u \u2032\n1\n\u2212\u221a\n.\ns23 c13 = \u221a + \u221a\n2 4 2 t \u2212 2u\n2 9\u03b2\n\n(26)\n\nFor an initial orientation we see that at zeroth order, s13 vanishes and also K has the tribimaximal form. When\nthe first order perturbation characterized by t and u is added, neither s13 nor s23 change. However s12 is somewhat\nmodified as discussed previously in section IV of [10]. When the second order perturbation characterized by t\u2032 and u\u2032\nis added, s13 finally becomes non-zero while both s12 and s23 suffer further corrections.\nBut something unusual is happening; there are terms for s13 and s23 which behave like t\u2032 /t and are manifestly of\nfirst order in strength. These arise from the energy difference denominator in Eq.(14). Since we had to use degenerate\nperturbation theory at first order this denominator is proportional to the first order \"energy\" corrections rather than\nthe zeroth order energies. Keeping terms of actual first order in strength we find the interesting relation:\ns13 \u2248 \u22122\u03b4s23 ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03b4s23 denotes the deviation of s23 from its tribimaximal value. Also the good approximation c13 = 1 was made.\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL ESTIMATES\n\nAlready, Fogli et. al. [37] and Schwetz et. al. [38] have pointed out that detailed analysis of existing neutrino\noscillation experiments gives some hint for non zero s13 . Thus it seems interesting to see what predictions emerge\nfrom Eq.(27).\nExpanding s23 around its \"tribimaximal value\" as s23 = [s23 ]T BM + \u03b4s23 , one gets:\n(s23 )2 \u2248\n\n1 \u221a\n+ 2\u03b4s23 .\n2\n\n(28)\n\nComparing with the results of a global analysis of the oscillation data given in Table A1 of [38] one then identifies,\nfor respectively 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 errors:\n|\u03b4s23 | = 0.05,\n\n0.08,\n\n0.11.\n\n(29)\n\n\f6\nNote that the three cases are associated with the experimental data relating to the 2-3 type neutrino oscillations.\nUsing Eq.(27) then leads to the corresponding predictions,\n|s13 | < 0.025,\n\n0.040,\n\n0.055.\n\n(30)\n\nIt is amusing to note that these values range from about 1/4 to 1/2 of the \"best fit\" value |s13 | = 0.11, which is also\npresented in the first column of Table A1 in [38]. Of course, our estimates provide a test of the present theoretical\nmodel for neutrino parameters and have no connection with experimental data on |s13 |.\nAs discussed above, the theoretical estimate for |s13 |, is of characteristic first order strength, appearing as a ratio\nof a second order quantity divided by a first order quantity. Using Eq.(26) for s13 and neglecting the term of second\norder strength we can get an estimate of the relative second to first order effects:\n|\n\n\u221a\nt\u2032 \u2212 2u\u2032\n| \u2248 2 2|s13 | \u2248 0.071,\nt \u2212 2u\n\n0.11,\n\n0.16,\n\n(31)\n\nwherein Eq.(30) was used. Evidently the second order effects seem to be suppressed by about 1/10 compared to\nthe first order effects. On the other hand, as seen in Eq.(20), the quantities t\u2032 and u\u2032 enter in the true second order\ncorrections for the neutrino mass differences. Thus those corrections are likely to be small\u2013 on the order of ten percent\nof the first order mass splittings.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this work, we designated the zeroth order parameter as \u03b2, the first order parameters as t and u and the second\norder parameters as t\u2032 and u\u2032 . The first order corrections to the neutrino masses were suppressed by (t, u)/\u03b2 compared\nto zeroth order. For the mixing angles, the first order corrections had a previously obtained piece proportional to\n(t, u)/\u03b2 as well as a new piece proportional to (t\u2032 , u\u2032 )/(t, u). The latter term arose because we are using degenerate\nperturbation theory and is clearly important for s13 to be non-zero and correlated to corrections of s23 .\nHere, we have numerically neglected, for both masses and mixing angles terms proportional to (t\u2032 , u\u2032 )/\u03b2. In [10]\nwe considered (t, u)/\u03b2 to be about 1/5. Here we found a characteristic strength of s13 to correspond to (t\u2032 , u\u2032 )/(t, u)\nabout 1/10. Both of these magnitudes are roughly similar.\nNote that Eqs.(20) for the neutrino mass differences and Eqs.(26) for the mixing angles do contain pieces of actual\nsecond order strength. These should be interesting to study in the future when more precise data becomes available.\nThe first order corrected formula for the neutrinoless double beta decay factor is given in Eq.(51) of [10]. This was\nderived from Eq.(49) in which (s13 )2 was set to zero. Now s13 is not zero but its square contributes at a higher order.\nFurthermore, it is easy to see, using Eqs.(16), that the first two terms in Eq.(49) do not have any contributions of\nfirst order strength like (t\u2032 , u\u2032 )/(t, u). Hence that formula for mee still holds to first order.\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are happy to thank Amir Fariborz, Salah Nasri and Francesco Sannino for helpful discussions and encouragment.\nThe work of R.

This can be\napplied to the case at hand or more generally when the mass matrix is invariant at zeroth order under a finite group\nG0 and then we add perturbations of decreasing importance in the small parameter x such that for example the nth\nperturbation is of order xn and is invariant under a smaller group Gn . The mass matrix can then be written as an\nexpansion in x,\nM (x) = M0 + xM1 + x2 M2 + ...\nwhere M0 is invariant under G0 , M1 under G1 and so on.\n\n(A1)\n\n\f7\nThe eigenvalues (diagonal) and eigenvector matrices can also be expanded as,\nMd (x) = Md0 + xMd1 + x2 Md2 + ...\nR(x) = R0 + xR1 + x2 R2 + ...\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere,\nRT (x)M (x)R(x) = Md (x)\n\n(A3)\n\nis the eigenvalue equation.\nIf we differentiate Eq (A3) once we obtain:\nRT \u2032 M R + RT M \u2032 R + RT M R\u2032 = Md\u2032\n\n(A4)\n\n[Md , RT R\u2032 ] + RT M \u2032 R = Md\u2032\n\n(A5)\n\nwhich can be written as:\n\nHere we used the orthonormality condition for the eigenvector matrix:\nRT \u2032 R + RT R\u2032 = 0\n\n(A6)\n\nNote that the matrix RT \u2032 R which appears in what follows is antisymmetric (in each order of perturbation theory)\nand in consequence all of its derivatives will be antisymmetric.\nThe second derivative and third derivative equations will read:\n[Md\u2032 , RT R\u2032 ] + [Md , (RT R\u2032 )\u2032 ] + [RT M \u2032 R, RT R\u2032 ] + RT M \u2032\u2032 R = Md\u2032\u2032 ,\n[Md\u2032 , RT R\u2032 ] + 2[Md\u2032 , (RT R\u2032 )\u2032 ] + [Md , (RT R\u2032 )\u2032\u2032 ] +\n[[RT M \u2032 R, RT R\u2032 ], RT R\u2032 ] + 2[RT M \u2032\u2032 R, RT R\u2032 ] + [RT M \u2032 R, (RT R\u2032 )\u2032 ] + RT M \u2032\u2032\u2032 R = Md\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\n(A7)\n\nAll commutators of diagonal matrices give zero on diagonal and in consequence the mass eigenvalues are obtained\nfrom the rest of the terms.\nIt is clear that by setting x = 0 one can associate the first derivative with the first order perturbation theory,\nsecond with second order and so on. The mass eigenvalues and the matrix RT R\u2032 can be extracted in each order from\nequations like Eq (A5) and Eq(A7).\nThen one should use the orthonormality condition to obtain the eigenvector matrix according to:\nRT (x)R\u2032 (x) = R0T R1 + x(R1T R1 + 2R0T R2 ) + ....\n\n(A8)\n\n.\nUsing this method and G0 = S3 , G1 = S23 and G2 = S12 one retrieves the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in each\norder of perturbation theory. The results agree with those presented in the main text.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nKamLAND collaboration, K. Eguchi et al, Phys. Rev.
