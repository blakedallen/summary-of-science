I NTRODUCTION\nLinear receivers are widely used for their low complexity\ncompared to maximum likelihood (ML) receivers. In the context of MIMO systems, linear receivers such as the minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) receiver are adopted in some of the\nemerging standards, e.g. IEEE 802.11n and 802.16e. Therefore\nthe analysis of MMSE receivers is strongly motivated by both\ntheoretical and practical considerations.\nA significant amount of research has focused on linear\nreceivers, however, their performance is not fully understood\nin the MIMO channel. For instance, the distribution of the\noutput signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the\nlinear MIMO receiver is still unknown except in asymptotic\nregimes (large number of antennas, and high/low SNR) [1]\u2013\n[4]. The outage and diversity of MMSE receiver have also\nbeen a subject of interest. It has been observed [5]\u2013[7] that\nwhile the MMSE receiver can extract the full spatial diversity\nof the MIMO quasi-static channel at low rates, it does not\nenjoy this feature at high rates.\nFigure 1 shows the outage probabilities (for various spectral efficiencies R bps/Hz) of MMSE and ML receivers\nrespectively. Clearly, one of the main differences between the\ntwo characteristics is the slope of the error curves, i.e., the\nThe authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, the\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083-0688 USA, E-mail:\nahmed.mehana@student.utdallas.edu; aria@utdallas.edu.\n\ndiversity. Figure 1 shows that in a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system the\nML receiver achieves diversity 4 at all rates. However, the\nMMSE receiver diversity varies with the operating spectral\nefficiency. From a system design perspective, obtaining the\nMMSE diversity is important in order to understand the broad\ntradeoffs involved in the determination of the operating point\nof the system and predicting its performance.\nIn this work we seek answers for the following questions:\nwhen can the MMSE receiver exploit the full diversity in\nMIMO channel? More generally, how does the diversity of\nthe MMSE receiver vary with the system parameters such as\nspectral efficiency R, the number of antennas, and in case of\ninter-symbol interference channel (ISI), the channel memory?\nThe well-known and powerful framework of diversitymultiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is not sufficient to answer the\nabove questions, because the DMT framework cannot distinguish between different spectral efficiencies that correspond\nto the same multiplexing gain. In the MIMO MMSE receiver,\nrates that correspond to the same multiplexing gain can\nproduce different diversities.\nWe approach the problem of MMSE reception in MIMO\nflat fading channels through a rate-dependent approximation\nof the outage probability and then proceed with bounding\nthe pairwise error probability (PEP) from both sides using\nthe outage. This leads to a closed-form expression for the\ndiversity-rate tradeoff which reveals the relationship between\ndiversity, spectral efficiency, and number of transmit and\nreceive antennas. The approximation of outage and PEP as\nfunctions of rate requires more delicate handling compared\nwith the DMT analysis, as certain ratios and terms that simply\nvanish in the DMT analysis are in our case relevant and must\nbe carefully handled.\nWe then analyze the frequency-selective, quasi-static MIMO\nchannel. Specifically we consider single carrier (SC) MMSE\nequalization under zero-padding (ZP) and cyclic-prefix (CP)\ntransmission. SC-MMSE provides an attractive alternative to\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) due to its\nlow complexity and natural avoidance of the peak-to-average\npower ratio problem. The use of cyclic prefix and zero padding\nhas been investigated in the literature, but the explicit tradeoff\nbetween the spectral efficiency and diversity of MIMO SCMMSE under these two schemes has been unknown and is the\nsubject of our work. We show that the diversity is a function of\nnumber of antennas, channel memory and spectral efficiency,\nand obtain the explicit tradeoff in the special case of SIMO\nunder CP transmission.\nThe results of this paper fully characterize the MIMO\nMMSE diversity in the fixed rate flat quasi-static regime.\nWe analyze both the cases N \u2265 M and N < M , showing\n\n\f2\n\n2X2 MIMO withML\u2212Rx\n\n0\n\n2X2 MIMO with MMSE\u2212Rx\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\nR=10\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\nP(Outage)\n\nP(Outage)\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\nR=4\nR=1\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u22127\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nSNR\n\nFig. 1.\n\n15\n\n20\nSNR\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nOutage probability of ML receiver (left) and MMSE (right) with M = N = 2 antennas and for rates R= 1, 4, and 10 bps/Hz\n\nthat in either case it is possible for the system to be limited\nto a diversity strictly less than M N . More specifically, the\ncentral result of the paper is as follows: with M transmit\nand N receive antennas (for\nis\n\u0001+any N and M ) the diversity\nR\nR\nd = \u2308 M 2\u2212 M \u2212 (M \u2212 N )+ \u23092 + |N \u2212 M |\u2308 M 2\u2212 M \u2212 (M \u2212\n\u0001+\nN )+ \u2309, where (*)+ = max(0, *) and \u2308*\u2309 denotes rounding\nup to the next higher integer. Our results confirm and refine\nthe earlier approximate results on the diversity of MMSE\nMIMO receivers that were obtained for very high and very\nlow rates [5]\u2013[7]. The MIMO MAC channel is also studied.\nSome of the related literature is as follows. The performance\nof MMSE receiver in terms of reliability goes back to [8]\nwhere outage analysis was performed for MMSE SIMO diversity combiner in a Rayleigh fading channel with multiple\ninterferers. In the context of point-to-point MIMO systems,\nGore et al. [9] compared the performance of MMSE DBLAST with the ordered successive cancellation V-BLAST.\nThey show that the former has better throughput at low- and\nmoderate SNR. Onggosanusi et al. [5] studied MMSE and\nzero-forcing (ZF) MIMO receivers and noticed their distinct\noutage performance at high-SNR, specifically for large number\nof transmit antennas and low spectral efficiencies R, but\nprovided no analysis.\nHedayat and Nosratinia [6] considered the outage probability as a function of fixed rates R under joint and separate\nspatial encoding, but for MMSE they obtained results only in\nthe extremes of very high and very low rates. Kumar et al. [7]\nprovided a DMT analysis for the system of [6] and observed\nthat the DMT analysis does not predict the diversity of MMSE\nreceivers at lower rates. We note that all existing analyses are\nlimited to the case where the number of receive antennas (N )\nis greater than or equal the number of the transmit antennas\n(M ).\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II describes\nthe system model. Section III finds the exponential order of\noutage. Section IV bounds the codeword error probabilities\nusing the outage values, and derives the final result. Section V\nextends the result to the MAC channel. Section VI calculates\n\nthe diversity of MIMO MMSE reception in frequency-selective\nblock-transmission systems. Section VII provides simulations\nthat illuminate our results.\nII. L INEAR R ECEIVERS\nThe input-output system model for flat fading MIMO channel with M transmit and N receive antennas is given by\ny = Hx + n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H \u2208 CN \u00d7M is the channel matrix whose entries are\nindependent and identically distributed complex Gaussian,\nx \u2208 C M\u00d71 is the transmitted vector, n \u2208 C N \u00d71 is the Gaussian noise vector. The vectors x and n are assumed independent. We assume a quasi-static flat fading channel and perfect\nchannel state information (CSI) at the receiver (CSIR) and\nno CSI at the transmitter (CSIT), therefore transmit antennas\noperate with equal power.\nWe aim to characterize the diversity gain, d(R, M, N ),\nas a function of the spectral efficiency R (bits/sec/Hz) and\nthe number of transmit and receive antennas. This requires a\npairwise error probability (PEP) analysis which is not directly\ntractable. Instead, we find the exponential order of outage\nprobability and then demonstrate that outage and PEP exhibit\nidentical exponential orders.\nFollowing the notation of [10], we define the outage-type\nquantities\nPout (R, N, M ) , P(I(x; y) < R)\nlog Pout (R, M, N )\ndout (R, N, M ) , \u2212 lim\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\nlog \u03c1\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the per-stream signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nWe say that the two functions f (\u03c1) and g(\u03c1) are exponen.\ntially equal, denoted by f (p) = g(p) when\nlim\n\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\nlog g(\u03c1)\nlog f (\u03c1)\n= lim\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\nlog(\u03c1)\nlog(\u03c1)\n\n\f3\n\nSISO Encoder\n\nH\n\nDeMux\n\nFig. 2.\n\nMMSE\n\nMUX\n\nSISO Decoder\n\nMIMO system with linear MMSE receiver\n\n \u0307 are also defined accordThe ordering operators 6\u0307 and >\n. d\ningly. If f (\u03c1) = \u03c1 , we say that d is the exponential order of\nf (p).\n\nunder either uniform or non-uniform rate assignment.\nFurthermore, it has been established [6], [7] that the zero\nforcing equalizer achieves diversity N \u2212 M + 1 under both\njoint or separate spatial encoding.\n\nA. MMSE Equalizer\n\nAccording to Theorem 1, a MMSE receiver operating under\nseparate spatial encoding (e.g. horizontal encoding V-BLAST)\nwill have no more diversity gain than ZF receiver.\n\nThe equalizer, denoted by W, decouples the M transmitted\ndata streams at the receiver (Figure 2). The MMSE equalizer is\nobtained by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) defined\nas E[||x \u2212 WH y||2 ]. It is usually assumed [6], [7] that the\nnumber of transmit antennas M is no more than that of receive\nantennas N . In the following, we start with N \u2265 M but later\ngeneralize it to N < M as well.\nFor N \u2265 M , using the orthogonality principle, the MMSE\nequalizer is given by [5], [11]\nW = HH (HHH + \u03c1\u22121 I)\u22121\n= (HH H + \u03c1\u22121 I)\u22121 HH\n\n(4)\n\nThe corresponding signal-to-interference and noise ratio\n(SINR) of the output stream k of the MMSE detector is\n1\n\u2212 1, 1 6 k 6 M\n(5)\n\u03b3k =\n(I + \u03c1HH H)\u22121\nkk\nwhere (*)H denotes matrix Hermitian, (*)\u22121\nkk denotes the diagonal element k of the matrix inverse.\nFor the case N < M , it can be shown using a technique1\nvery similar to [8, Appendix A] that the SINR expression (5)\nis again valid.\nThe square matrix W = HH H is random, non-negative\ndefinite, and obeys the Wishart Distribution [12], [13]. In this\nwork, the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of this equivalent\nchannel matrix opens the door to the development of our\nanalysis, as is also the case in many other MIMO results.\nThe equalizer output is\ny = WHx + Wn.\n\n(6)\n\nThe signal streams of the transmit antennas may be either\nseparately or jointly encoded. Separate encoding is simpler\nand has been fully analyzed [6], but we mention the central\nresult for completeness.\nTheorem 1 ( [6], [7]): In a MIMO system consisting of M\ntransmit and N receive antennas (N > M ), under separate\nspatial encoding, the MMSE receiver achieves the diversity\ndout (R, N, M ) = N \u2212 M + 1\n\n(7)\n\n1 In [8] an MMSE diversity combiner is used at the receiver in the presence\nof one transmit antenna and M interferers.\n\nIII. O UTAGE A NALYSIS\nWe now consider the MMSE diversity where the data\nstream is first encoded then multiplexed into M sub-streams,\neach transmitted by one antenna. This approach is known to\nimprove the performance compared with separate coding of\nthe streams [14]. Outage occurs if the channel fails to support\nthe target rate [12]. After channel equalization, the M substreams xk are decoupled and thus the mutual information\nbetween the transmitted vector x and the received vector y\ngiven CSIR is [5]\nI(x, y) =\n\nM\nX\n\nI(xk , yk )\n\n(8)\n\nk=1\n\nThus from (2) and (8), Pout is given by\n\u0012X\n\u0013\nM\nPout = P\nlog(1 + \u03b3k ) < R\n\n(9)\n\nk=1\n\nSubstituting MMSE SINR (\u03b3k ) from (5) in (9) we get\n\u0012X\n\u0013\nM\n\u22121\nPout = P\nlog(I + \u03c1W)kk > \u2212R\n\n(10)\n\nk=1\n\nThe dependence on the diagonal elements of the random\nmatrix (I + \u03c1W)\u22121\nkk makes further analysis intractable.

F REQUENCY-S ELECTIVE C HANNEL\nBroadband wireless systems usually operate in frequencyselective channels where, in addition to the spatial diversity\nobtained in MIMO broadband systems, frequency diversity can\nbe achieved. Broadband systems usually employ orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or single carrier (SC)\ntransmission [17]. Specifically, SC was shown to be attractive\nfor broadband wireless channels due to its lower complexity,\nlower peak-to-average power ratio and reduced sensitivity to\ncarrier frequency errors compared to OFDM [17], [18].\nIn this section, we investigate the diversity achieved by SCMMSE receivers for two block transmission schemes, namely\ncyclic prefix (CP) and zero-padding (ZP) schemes. The CP\nand ZP are commonly used for guard intervals in block quasistatic channels. Although CP was initially proposed for both\nsingle carrier and multi-carrier systems, ZP was lately shown\nto be an attractive alternative for both systems [19], [20].\n\nA.

The PEP analysis follows in a\ndirect manner as in the flat fading case so we omit it.\nB. The Zero Padding MMSE Receiver\nIt is known that in a point-to-point single-antenna ISI channel, linear receivers can achieve full multipath diversity under\nzero-padding transmission [20], [22], [23]. In this section we\ninvestigate the similar question for MIMO systems whose\nreceivers use linear MMSE operations in both the spatial and\ntemporal dimensions. We provide lower and upper bounds on\ndiversity. The bounds are not always tight, but the diversity is\nfully characterized for SIMO systems.\nWe begin by analyzing the tradeoff between the spectral\nefficiency R and the diversity of MMSE receiver in the\nsingle-antenna ISI channel dISI\nMMSE under ZP transmission.\nTajer et al [10] shows that dISI\nMMSE varies with R under\nCP transmission and MMSE equalization, in particular, for\na quasi-static single-antenna ISI channel with \u03bd + 1 taps, the\ndiversity of the SC-MMSE receiver under CP transmission is\n\u2212R\ndCP\nLd \u230b), where Ld is the transmission\nMMSE = 1+min(\u03bd, \u230a2\ndata block length. We show that the same is not true for ZP\ntransmission.\nLemma 5: For a quasi-static single-antenna ISI channel\nwith \u03bd + 1 taps, the diversity of the SC-MMSE receiver under\nZP transmission is dZP\nMMSE = \u03bd + 1 irrespective of R.\nProof: See Appendix A.\nWe proceed with lower and upper bounds on diversity for\nMIMO ISI channel.\n1) Diversity Upper Bound: Applying the MMSE equalizer\ngiven by (80) to the received vector in (77), the effective\nmutual information between x\u0302 and W\u0233 is equal to the sum\nof mutual information of their components [5]\nI(x\u0302, W\u0233) =\n\n1\nLd\n\nML\nXd\n\n=\n\nl=1\n\nk=1\n\nThus the outage probability is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nML\n1 Xd\nlog(1 + \u03b3k ) < R\n(82)\nPout = P\nLd\nk=1\n\u0012\n\u0013\nML\n1 Xd\n1\n=P\nlog\n<\nR\n(83)\nLd\n(I + \u03c1He H He )\u22121\nkk\nk=1\n\u0013\n\u0012\nML\n1\n1 Xd\n< R (84)\n> P M log\nM Ld\n(I + \u03c1He H He )\u22121\nkk\nk=1\nwhere we have used Jensen's inequality as in Section III-B.

The\nsystem model is given by (77) where the N Ld \u00d7Ld equivalent\nchannel matrix is given by\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nh0 h1 * * * h\u03bd\n0 *** 0\n\uf8ef 0 h0 h1 * * * h\u03bd * * * 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nHe = \uf8ef . .\n(116)\n.. \uf8fa .\n.. ... ... ... ...\n\uf8f0 ..\n. \uf8fb\nh1 h2 * * * h\u03bd\n0 * * * h0\nwhere hi (for i = 0, 1, . . . , \u03bd) is N \u00d7 1 SIMO channel.

The\nPEP analysis follows in a manner similar to Section IV.\nRecall that so far we have considered data block length\nLd = \u03bd + 1. It can be shown that the diversity for any Ld >\n\u03bd + 1 is upper bounded by the computed diversity for the case\nLd = \u03bd + 1. This bounding is derived from (104) via FFT\narguments similar to those used in [10], which we omit for\nbrevity. A tight diversity lower bound for data block lengths\nLd > \u03bd + 1 remains an open problem, except for the SIMO\nsystem as discussed in the next section.\n\nwhere (118) follows from (117) and (119) follows similarly\nto (105).\nIn a manner similar to (105) we have \u03bbk = BH\nk Bk because\nnow B is simply a N \u00d7 1 vector. For the case Ld = \u03bd +\n1, the eigenvalues {\u03bbk } are distributed according to Gamma\ndistribution with shape parameter N and scale parameter 1,\ni.e. \u03bbk \u223c \u0393(N, 1). For Ld > \u03bd + 1 the Gaussian variables\nin Bk are no longer independent and thus analyzing this case\nrequires the unknown distribution {\u03bbk }. Instead, we indirectly\nshow that the diversity of Ld = \u03bd+1 also holds for Ld > \u03bd+1.\nLemma 9: In a SIMO quasi-static frequency-selective channel with memory \u03bd, N receive antennas and data-block length\n\n\f14\n\nLd = \u03bd + 1, the MMSE receiver diversity is dCP\nMMSE =\nN (\u230aLd 2\u2212R \u230b + 1) under joint spatial encoding and cyclic\nprefix transmission.\nProof:\nLd\nX\n\n\u0001\n1\n> Ld 2\u2212R\n(1 + \u03c1\u03bbk )\nk=1\n\u0001\n=\n \u0307 P M (\u03b1) > Ld 2\u2212R\n(120)\nP\nwhere we use M (\u03b1) = \u03b1k >1 1 from (106).

The result is extended to the multiple\naccess channel (MAC).

That is,\nLemma 11 is not true for CP transmission. This is because\nthe equivalent channel in CP systems does not have the same\nproperties that were used in [22], [28].\nB. Proof of Lemma 8:(QIP Problem)\nConsider the following Quadratic Integer Programming\n(QIP) problem\n\nsubject to\n\n\u03a9\nX\nj=0\n\nPz = E(||Wzf n|| )\n\nn1 ,n2 ,...,nl\n\n\u03a9\nX\nj=0\n\n2\n\nmin\n\n(j \u2212 m)Sj = ml + K. (139)\n\nEvaluating the objective function:\n\nPz = E tr[zzH ]\n\u0003\n\u0002\n= tr E((He H He )\u22121 He H nnH He (He H He )\u22121 )\nH\n\nnk =\n\nl\nX\n\nk=1\nl\nX\n\n(138)\n\nnk = \u03a9\n\nk=1\n\nnk \u2265 0.\nwhere \u03a9 and l are integers.\nConsider a candidate solution vector [n1 , . . . , nk , . . . , nl ].\nWe partition the variables in this vector according to their\nvalues into \u03a9 + 1 sets Nj = {nk : nk = j} for 0 \u2264\nj \u2264 \u03a9; clearly some of these sets may be empty. Denote\nthe membership of each set Sj = |Nj |. Furthermore, let\n\nj=0\n\n(j \u2212 m)2 Sj\n\n(j \u2212 m)2 Sj\n\n(140)\n\n(j \u2212 m)Sj\n\n(141)\n\n= lm2 + 2mK + K\n(142)\nP\u03a9\nwhere (140) and (142) use\nj=0 (j \u2212 m)Sj = K, which\nfollows from (139).\nWe now propose that one may achieve optimality when all\nvariables take values either m or m + 1. In that case,\nX\nnk = mSm + (m + 1)(l \u2212 Sm ) = ml + (l \u2212 Sm )\nk\nX\nk\n\nn2k = m2 Sm + (m + 1)2 (l \u2212 Sm ) = lm2 + 2mK + K.\n\nwhere we substituted the value of l\u2212Sm from the first equation\ninto the second equation above. This shows that the variables\ntaking values m or m + 1 achieves the lower bound in (142).\nAt optimality Sm = (m + 1)l \u2212 \u03a9.\nC. Proof of Lemma 10\nWe begin by showing that for any integer multiplier of\nLd1 = \u03bd + 1 denoted by Ld2 = T Ld1 (T \u2208 N) and any\nreal-valued m \u2208 (0, Ld1 ), we have\nP\n\n\u0012X\nL d1\nq=1\n\nn2k\n\n\u03a9\nX\n\n1\n>m\n(1 + \u03c1\u03bbq )\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012X\nL d2\n.\n=P\nq=1\n\n1\n>m\n(1 + \u03c1\u03bbq )\n\nNote that for SIMO-CP system, \u03bbq =\nthe N \u00d7 1 vector given by\nb(i)\nq\n\n=\n\n\u03bd\nX\n\nhn e\n\n\u2212j 2\u03c0(q\u22121)\nL\ndi\n\nbH\nq bq ,\n\n\u0013\n\n(143)\nwhere bq is\n\nfor q = 1, . . . , Ldi\n\n(144)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere hn is the channel gain as a function of the tap index n,\nand the superscript i = 1, 2 is used to distinguish the variables\nin two systems with data block lengths Ld1 and Ld2 .\nRecall that we can take a Ld1 -point signal and apply a Ld2 point DFT on it (after zero-padding), which will result in a\nresampling in the Fourier domain at Ld2 points. Following [10]\n\n\f17\n\nwe can write the explicit relationship between entries of b(1)\nand b(2) as\n(1)\nbq,l\n\n=\n\nL d1\nX\n\n(2)\nbi,l \u03c8i\n\nq = 1, 2 . . . , Ld2 and l = 1, 2, . . . , N.\n\ni=1\n\nS1 ,\n\n\u03c8i =\n\n1\u2212e\n1\u2212e\n\n\u2212j\n\nLd\n\n(1)\n\nlog |bq,l |2\nlog \u03c1 .\n\nS2 ,\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\u0001.\n\n(2)\n\nNote that bT (q\u22121),l = bq,l and\n\n\u03b1T (q\u22121),l = \u03b1q,l for q = 1, 2 . . . , Ld1 since Ld2 = T Ld1 .\nFrom (145), we have\n(1)\n\nL d1\nX\ni=1\n\n(2)\n\n|\u03c8i |2 |bi,l |2 +\n\nL d1 L d1\nX\nX\n\n(2) \u2217(2)\n\n\u03c8i \u03c8s bi,l bs,l .\n\n(146)\n\ni=1 s=1\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n}\n\n,\u03b7\n\nWe now analyze each part of the sum in (146).
