The system consists of the O9.7I star HDE 226868\nof 40 M\u2299 [18] and a compact object with a mass of about\n10 M\u2299 . Most of the time (90% up to MJD 51300, 75%\nfrom then on [17]) the source can be found in its hard\nstate, where the X-ray spectrum is characterized by a\npower law with photon index \u0393 \u2248 1.7 and an exponential cutoff at \u2248 150 keV [8, and references therein]. Further spectral characteristics are reflection features from\nthe accretion disk and a relativistically broadened Fe K\u03b1\nemission line at about 6.4 keV. The other canonical state\nin which Cyg X-1 can be found is the soft state during\nwhich the spectrum is dominated by a soft component\npeaking at \u223c 1 keV followed by a power law tail with\nindex \u0393 \u2248 2 \u2212 3 [5, 13]. Between these two extremes\nCyg X-1 can also be found in the so called \"intermediate\n\nFigure 1. RXTE ASM light curve of Cyg X-1. The vertical lines mark the times of our observations.\n\nstates\" which exhibit properties of both canonical states\n[1].\nCyg X-1 was observed in 2004 with INTEGRAL ,\nRXTE , and XMM-Newton simultaneously on November 14/15 (hereafter called obs1), 20/21 (obs2), 26/27\n(obs3) and on December 2/3 (obs4). Fig.1 shows the\nRXTE /ASM lightcurve of Cyg X-1 with the four observations indicated by vertical bars. The log of observations\nis given in Table 1. The observations took place during\none of the transitional states of Cyg X-1 which are very\ninteresting for a further study due to the fact that they are\ncharacterized by radio flaring, the presence of a relativistically broadened iron line as well as a complex X-ray\ntiming behavior [e.g. 4, 12, 17, 11, 2].\n\n\fDue to the not yet finalized calibration of the XMMNewton Modified Timing Mode we divide our analysis in\ntwo parts. For the first part we combined the INTEGRAL\nand RXTE data to study the broadband continuum. The\nanalysis of the relativistically broadened Fe K\u03b1 line was\ndone independently using the XMM-Newton data only.\n\n2.\n\nCONTINUUM\n\nTo model the broadband continuum we used the hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization code eqpair\nby [3] which also includes electron-positron pair production. In this model the temperature of the Comptonizing medium is computed self-consistently by balancing\nCompton cooling with external heating. The amount of\nheating is specified by the the ratio lh /ls of the compactness of the Comptonizing medium and the seed photon\ndistribution. We modeled the soft emission by adding a\ndiskbb component which provides the seed photons for\nthe Comptonization (therefore we set the temperature of\nthe eqpair seed photons equal to the temperature at the\ninner edge of the disk). This continuum is partly reflected\noff the accretion disk (XSPEC model reflect) and modified at lower energies by interstellar absorption.\nWe first performed pure thermal eqpair fits to the four\nobservations independently [7]. In all cases they showed\nevidence of a spectral hardening above \u2248 300 keV which\ncould be an indicator for the presence of a non-thermal\nelectron component in the plasma. In order to get better statistics for SPI in the crucial energy range we decided to sum up a time averaged spectrum comprising all\nINTEGRAL and RXTE observations although Cyg X-1\nwas highly variable during the observations. For this time\naveraged spectrum we first considered again a pure thermal plasma. We fixed ls = 10 to force the seed photon\nspectrum to be dominated by disk radiation and assumed\na disk inclination of 45 deg [e.g. 9]. As the inner radius of\nthe disk could not be constrained it was fixed to its default\nvalue Rin = 10Rg . Table 2 shows the best fit parameters.\nThe resulting disk parameters kT in = 1.10+0.03\n\u22120.02 keV and\nnorm=45+7\nas\nwell\nas\nthe\nvalues\nfor\nthe\ncompactness\nra\u22123\n+0.02\n+0.01\ntio (lh /ls = 3.32\u22120.01), the optical depth (\u03c4 = 1.23\u22120.01),\n\nnormalized counts\ns\u22121 keV\u22121\n\n102\n\n\u03c7\n\nIn this contribution we present some results of our\nongoing analysis. For RXTE we used data from the\nPCA and HEXTE , covering an energy range from 3 to\n120 keV. The data extraction was done using HEASOFT\n5.3.1. The INTEGRAL spectra comprise information of\nthe three instruments JEM-X , IBIS (ISGRI) , and SPI ,\nincluding energies up to 1 MeV and were reduced using\nINTEGRAL OSA 5.1. The data reduction followed\nthe standard procedures as described in the cookbooks\n(http://isdc.unige.ch/?Support+documents).\nFor XMM-Newton we only use data from the EPIC-pn\nas the EPIC-MOS was switched off to allocate maximum\ntelemetry to the EPIC-pn (see also the paragraph on the\nModified Timing Mode below). The energy range used\nfor the XMM-Newton analysis is 2.8 to 9.4 keV.\n\n100\n10\u22122\n10\u22124\n10\u22126\n4\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n4\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n3\n\n10\n\n20\n100\nEnergy [keV]\n\n1000\n\nFigure 2.

Also the Iron line\nparameters match the values obtained before. The \u03c72red\nyields a value of 1.72 with 350 dof. As shown in Fig. 2\na deviation between the data points and this pure thermal\nmodel is still present in the time averaged spectrum.\nTherefore we added a non-thermal component in the\neqpair model by allowing the parameter lnth /lh to vary.\nWe found that 57% of the power supplied to the electrons\nin the plasma is contained in the non-thermal distribution of the electrons, which was chosen to be a power law\n(Table 2).

In the\nEPIC-pn burst mode (which is foreseen for very bright\nsources) only 3% of all detected photons are transmitted\nresulting in a enormous reduction of the signal to noise\nratio. We therefore used an alternative approach which\nincludes switching off the EPIC-MOS camera and running the EPIC-pn in a Modified Timing Mode [10]. In\nthis mode the lower energy threshold was increased to\n2.8 keV (the standard value is 200 eV). This implies that\na re-calibration of the instrument is required because the\ncombination of split events is not done on-board but during the first step of the EPIC-pn data analysis. Due to\nthe increased lower threshold a large fraction of the split\npartners is not transmitted and therefore the spectrum appears to be softer. By comparison with former Timing\nMode observations we built a new detector response matrix [16]. However, there are still some effects not included yet, for example the improvement of the Charge\nTransfer Efficiency of the detector due to the high count\nrates. The special calibration for the Modified Timing\nMode will be made public through the XMM-Newton\nSOC as soon as full confidence on the calibration has\nbeen reached.\n\n3.2. Relativistically broadened Iron lines\nThe Fe K\u03b1 line observed in BH candidates is intrinsically\nnarrow with a rest frame energy of 6.4\u20136.97 keV depending on the ionization state. It originates from material\nwhich is just a few gravitational radii away from the BH\nand therefore it is broadened by gravitational redshift effects as well as by Doppler shifts.

Lower panel: Fit to the whole band using a\npower-law and a narrow line and a relativistic line.\n\nline depends on the accretion geometry, namely on the\nFe K\u03b1 emissivity of the disk, the angular momentum of\nthe BH and the observer's viewing angle. Relativistically\nbroadened Iron lines are therefore an important observational tool for the understanding of the accretion geometry. For more information on relativistically broadened\nIron lines see for example [15, 6].\n\n3.3. Results\nDue to the increased soft X-ray emission during the transitional state there is an increased pile-up in the center\nof the point spread function. We therefore excluded data\nfrom the innermost 3 CCD columns from our analysis,\nhowever the signal to noise ratio of the data is still sufficient for spectral analysis as could be seen in Fig. 3.\nA power-law fit to the XMM-Newton data outside the\n5\u20138 keV band reveals strong residuals in the Fe K\u03b1 region (\u03c72red = 21.4). Modeling these residuals by a narrow\n(\u03c3 = 80 \u00b1 35 eV) line at E = 6.52 \u00b1 0.02 keV with an\nequivalent width of 14 eV and a relativistic Kerr line at\nE = 6.76 \u00b1 0.1 keV (equivalent width 400 eV) improves\nthe \u03c72red dramatically to 1.3. The emissivity of the relativistic line is found to be \u221d r\u22124.3\u00b10.1 . These parameters\nare similar to earlier Chandra intermediate state observations by Miller et al. [12]. Note however that the calibration of the timing mode is not yet fully completed so\nthat the energy values obtained from our analysis could\nbe slightly too high.\n\n\f4.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nThe 3 keV\u20131 MeV broadband spectrum of Cyg X-1 can\nbe well described by the eqpair model. The parameters we obtain from our analysis are consistent with previous results e.g. from the RXTE monitoring campaign\n[17, 7, 14]. Furthermore our data show evidence for the\npresence of a non-thermal component in the distribution\nof the electrons with 57% of the power supplied to the\nelectrons going into the non-thermal acceleration.\nThe simultaneous XMM-Newton observation confirms\nthe presence of a relativistic line [12] during the intermediate state of Cyg X-1 and the parameters obtained for\nthe broad and narrow components lead to the conclusion\nthat the accretion disk seems to extend down to the innermost stable orbit at 1.235 Rg.\nAs soon as the calibration of the Modified Timing Mode\nis completed we will combine all three instruments to\nmodel the whole broadband spectrum from 2.8 keV up\nto 1 MeV.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.
