For a given random network of N sites the\nlimit of fully coupled lattice where each site is connected to\nevery other one with the same strength plays an important role\nsince, for zero nonlinearity, introduces a high degree of degeneracy and thus localization [1]. It is therefore interesting\nto probe the dynamics in this fully coupled limit when the network is nonlinear. We use the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\n(DNLS) equation for this study since the latter is a prototypical equation with a large number of applications in condensed\nmatter physics, optics, Bose-Einstein condensation, etc. [2\u20134].\nThe DNLS equation in the fully coupled or Mean Field\n(MF) limit is given by:\n\ni\n\nd\u03c8n\n= \u03b5n \u03c8n + V \u2211 \u03c8m \u2212 \u03b3|\u03c8n |2 \u03c8n\ndt\nm6=n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8n (t) is a complex amplitude, V denotes the constant\noverlap integral connecting any two sites, \u03b5n a local site value\nand \u03b3 is a parameter that controls the strength of the nonlinear\nterm. When t is time, the equation describes the dynamics of\ninteracting particles with the nonlinear term representing polaronic effects or interaction of bosons in an optical lattice.\nWhen t is a space variable, the equation describes electric\nwave modes propagating in fibers that include nonlinearity.\nIn the present analysis we take \u03b5n = 0 while the DNLS norm\nequal to one, viz. \u2211 |\u03c8n |2 = 1 . For notational simplicity we\nrescale time to \u03c4 = Vt and \u03b3 to \u03c7 = \u03b3/V ; we note that for \u03c7 > 0\nwe have the defocusing DNLS equation while for \u03c7 < 0 we\nobtain the focusing case.\n\nII.\n\nREVIEW OF EARLIER LITERATURE\n\nThe problem of the DNLS equation in fully coupled lattices has been addressed in the past [2, 7\u201310]. Eilbeck et\nal. [2] analysed the stationary states of the problem for the\ngeneral N-site case. Molina and Tsironis [7] showed that in\nthe case of N = 3, i.e. a symmetric trimer, and for a localized initial condition, a transition occurs for \u03c7 = \u22126 where\nthe evolution ceases to be periodic and the averaged probability becomes equal in all three sites. It was also pointed\n\nout that no selftrapping occurs for positive nonlinearity values. This dynamical behaviour is analogous, but not identical,\nto the well known selftrapping transition of the dimer [5, 6].\nAndersen and Kenkre [8] solved analytically the symmetric\ntrimer case for localized as well as symmetrically delocalized\ninitial conditions. They wrote explicitly the time evolution\nat selftrating (\u03c7 = \u22126), connected it to the stationary states,\ncalculated the averaged occupation probability of the initially\npopulated site and showed that for a given value of the nonlinearity parameter extreme delocalization occurs. They also\npointed out that the nature of selftrapping in the trimer was\ndistinct from that in the dimer case. Subsequently, Andersen\nand Kenkre [9] analysed the fully connected N-site problem\nusing similar methods for localized and partially localized initial conditions and showed that a \"migratory\" transition takes\nplace in some cases. The latter is related to the fact that localization of the initially non-occupied sites may occur for some\nparameter values. In [9] a general expression in terms of\nthe Weierstrass elliptic function is given for the time evolution of the occupation probability as well as expressions for\nsome special cases. Additionally the time-averaged occupation probability is analysed. Finally, Molina [10] used an\nextension of the method of ref. [7] and determined explicitly\nthe values of the nonlinearity parameter at which there is a\n\"transition\" for arbitrary values of N.\nFrom the previous review of the existing literature it is clear\nthat the problem of nonlinearity induced localization in the\nfully coupled, MF limit, has been analysed thoroughly and\nmany of the features of the solution have been already discovered. However, we believe that a complete dynamical picture\nhas not emerged yet. Thus we will follow the approach of\nref. [9], re-derive the complete dynamical solution and use it\nto focus on the explicit dynamics and not just to the average\noccupation probability.\n\nIII. NONLINEAR LOCALIZATION\n\nIn the purely linear case for \u03c7 = 0, Eq. (1) reduces to a linear eigenvalue problem that has N \u2212 1 fold degenerate eigenvalues [1]. This high degree of degeneracy forces an initially\nspatially localized state to remain localized executing incomplete oscillations to the other, initially unoccupied, sites. This\nlinear localization at the initially excited site increases with\nthe system size.\n\n\f2\nA.\n\nNonlinear mean field limit\n\nFor the localized initial condition we observe that if we set\ninitially all probability at site one, then due to the symmetry\nof the lattice, the subsequent evolution of all sites except the\ninitially populated one will be identical; as a result we can cast\nthe original N-equation problem to a simpler one consisting of\nonly two equations, viz. [7\u201310]\ni\u03c8 \u03071 = (N \u2212 1)\u03c82 \u2212 \u03c7|\u03c81|2 \u03c81\n\nwith |\u03c81 |2 + (N \u2212 1)|\u03c82 |2 = 1. To obtain the set of equations\n3 we have set \u03c82 = \u03c83 = .. = \u03c8N at all times. We proceed\nby introducing the variable p(t) = |\u03c81 |2 \u2212 (N \u2212 1)|\u03c82 |2 and\ncast the set of complex equations (1) first into a second order\nequation that has the form of Newton's law and subsequently\ninto an equivalent potential problem for the localized initial\ncondition p(0) = 1 [5, 7\u201310], viz.\n\n(2)\n\ni\u03c8 \u03072 = \u03c81 + (N \u2212 2)\u03c82 \u2212 \u03c7|\u03c82| \u03c82\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u1e572 = U(p) \u2261 a0 p4 + 4a1 p3 + 6a2 p2 + 4a3 p + a4\na0 = \u2212\na1 = \u2212\n\n\u03c72 N 2\n\n16(N \u2212 1)2\n\n1\n[3\u03c7(N \u2212 2)N(\u22122 + \u03c7 + 2N)]\n48(N \u2212 1)2\n1\na2 =\n[32\u03c7 \u2212 8\u03c72 \u2212 56\u03c7N\n48(N \u2212 1)2\n\n+4\u03c72N \u2212 8N 2 + 28\u03c7N 2 + \u03c72N 2 + 16N 3 \u2212 4\u03c7N 3 \u2212 8N 4]\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n(N \u2212 2)(2N \u2212 2 + \u03c7)(8 \u2212 4\u03c7 \u2212 12N + 3\u03c7N + 4N 2)\na3 =\n16(N \u2212 1)2\n1\n[128 \u2212 64\u03c7 + 16\u03c72 \u2212 384N + 144\u03c7N \u2212 24\u03c72N +\na4 =\n16(N \u2212 1)2\n400N 2 \u2212 104\u03c7N 2 + 9\u03c72N 2 \u2212 160N 3 + 24\u03c7N 3 + 16N 4\n\nWe now form the invariants g2 , g3 :\n\ng3 =\n\ng2 = a0 a4 \u2212 4a1a3 + 3a22\n\na0 a2 a4 + 2a1a2 a3 \u2212 a32 \u2212 a0 a23 \u2212 a21 a4\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nThe solution is given in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic function P (t, g2 , g3 ) as follows [11]:\np(\u03c4) = 1 \u2212\n\n24(N \u2212 1)\n12P (\u03c4, g2 , g3 ) + \u03c72 + 2(N \u2212 2)\u03c7 + N 2\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nThis solution depends only on the nonlinearity parameter \u03c7\nand the number of sites N and presents the exact solution of\nthe nonlinear DNLS problem in the MF limit for localized\ninitial condition and arbitrary site number; it is equivalent to\nthe solution in ref. [9] for perfect initial localization on a\nsingle site. The Weierstrass function is doubly periodic with\nperiods 2\u03c9 and 2\u03c9\u2032 where \u03c9/\u03c9\u2032 is not real. The discriminant\n\u2206 = g32 \u2212 27g23 may be expressed as follows\n\n(14)\n\n1 2 2\nN \u03c7 g(N) (\u03c7 + 2N)\n16\n\u0001\ng(N) = 2(N \u2212 2)\u03c73 + 2 (N \u2212 2)(3N \u2212 8)\u03c72 + 6N 3 \u2212 53N 2 + 112N \u2212 64 \u03c7 + 2(N \u2212 1)N 3\n\u2206(N) = \u2212\n\nWhen the discriminant becomes zero, the Weierstrass solution changes character signalling a change in the physical behaviour of the system. The quantity \u2206(N) has three real roots,\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\ndenoted hereafter as \u03c70 , \u03c7c and \u03c7\u2032c for \u03c70 = 0, g(\u03c7c ) = 0 and\n\u03c7\u2032c = \u22122N respectively.\n\n\f3\nThe root for \u03c70 = 0 corresponds to the linear MF problem resulting in g2 = N 4 /12, g3 = N 6 /216, the Weierstrass\nfunction becomes a trigonometric function, viz. P (t, g2 , g3 ) =\n\u2212N 2 /12 + N 2/4 sin2 [(Nt/2)] and the solution for p(\u03c4) is\np(\u03c4) \u2261 plin (\u03c4) =\n\n(N \u2212 2)2 + 4(N \u2212 1) cos(N\u03c4)\nN2\n\n(17)\n\na result that agrees with the linear solutions derived in ref. [1].\nWe note that in the linear case\u0002 the system executes \u0003oscillations\nbetween p = 1 and plin,M = (N \u2212 2)2 \u2212 4(N \u2212 1) /N 2 while\np(\u03c4) oscillates around < plin >= (1 \u2212 2/N)2 . Only for N = 2\nwe have complete oscillations in the p-range 1, \u2212 1 while for\nall other geometries the linear system oscillations are incomplete, viz. there is always some occupation probability at the\noriginally populated site. In the limit of very large N there is\nextreme localization at the initially populated site.\nIn order to understand the role of \u03c7c , \u03c7\u2032c in the dynamical\nevolution, it is instructive to address first explicitly the regime\nfor N \u2264 4; although these cases have been studied in the past,\nthe present exposition furnishes additional results and new intuition.\n\nB. 2 \u2264 N \u2264 4\n\nIn this range we have \u03c7\u2032c \u2264 \u03c7c with the equality holding for\nN = 4.\n\n1.\n\nN=2\n\nIn the dimer case we have \u03c7c = 4 and \u03c7\u2032c = \u22124; when \u03c7\nassumes one of these two critical values, the invariants become g2 = 4/3, g3 = \u22128/27 , the frequencies \u03c9 = K(1) = \u221e,\n\u03c9\u2032 = iK\u2032 (1) = i\u03c0/2 and the Weierstrass function becomes a\nhyperbolic function, viz. P (t, 4/3, \u22128/27) = 1/3 + 1/ sinh2 t\nleading to p(t) = sech(2t). This situation corresponds to the\nwell known selftrapping transition for a localized initial condition where the solution at the transition is expressed as hyperbolic secant [5]. We note that in the dimer case \u03c7c = |\u03c7\u2032c |\nand for \u2212\u03c7c < \u03c7 < \u03c7c the particle executes complete oscillations.\n\n2.\n\nN=3\n\nIn ref. [7] a transition was found occurring at \u03c7\u2032c = \u22126,\nwhile in refs. [8, 9] the dynamical study was performed.\nAnalysis of the discriminant shows that in addition to the previously identified root \u03c7\u2032c = \u22122N = \u22126 there is also the real\nroot of g(\u03c7c ) = 0 at\n\"\n\n\u03c7c = \u2212 1 +\n\n131\n\n\u221a \u00011/3\n6614 \u2212 774 43\n\nor \u03c7c \u2248 \u22126.039904249.\n\n\u221a \u00011/3 #\n3307 \u2212 387 43\n(18)\n+\n32/3\n\nFor \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032c \u2261 \u22126 the invariants are g2 = 3/4, g3 =\n\u22121/8, \u03c9 becomes infinite and the Weierstrass function turns\ninto a hyperbolic function, viz.

For \u03c7 = 0, p(\u03c4) performs incomplete oscillations between p(0) = 1 and plin,M = \u22127/9.\nIncreasing \u03c7 to positive values augments gradually the effect\nof localization and the particle stays almost completely at the\ninitial site for large values of the nonlinearity parameter. For\nnegative values of \u03c7, however, the behaviour is markedly different; upon increasing \u03c7 in absolute value, the particle becomes more detrapped and performs oscillations beyond the\nplin,M limit. This behaviour continues as we further increase\n|\u03c7| and at \u03c7 = \u22124 the particle executes complete oscillations\nto the other sites. Further increase of nonlinearity reduces the\namplitude of the oscillatory motion while the oscillation period increases. For \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032c there is a transition to a hyperbolic,\nnon oscillatory behaviour; the particle collapses from complete oscillations to complete equipartition of probability in\nthe three sites (at infinite times). This is a remarkable transition since it localizes again the particle and all motion stops\nasymptotically [7, 8]. As the value of |\u03c7| increases further, the\ntrapping tendency increases rapidly and the particle becomes\nmore trapped in the initial site.\nAs the trimer crosses the value \u03c7c the discriminant becomes\nzero again with positive invariants; this means that the time\nevolution simplifies to one with trigonometric evolution. Although this feature is not exceptional in the trimer, it is quite\ninteresting when it appears for N > 4; we will comment on\nthis trigonometric transition below.\nThe transition at \u03c7\u2032c is a selftrapping transition in the sense\nthat it forces probability equipartition on all three sites, similar\nto the corresponding behaviour in the dimer. It is remarkable\nthat nonlinearity first detraps the particle and after reaching a\nregime of complete oscillatory motion it then forces the particle to selftrapping. As a result nonlinearity first restores the\ndegeneracy that has been lifted by the presence of more than\ntwo sites and subsequently acts in way analogous to the dimer\ncase, viz. reaches an equipartition state through a hyperbolic\nfunction transition.\n\n3.\n\nN=4\n\nThe tetrahedral configuration obtainned for N = 4 is rather\ninteresting with \u03c7c = \u03c7\u2032c = \u22128, g2 = g3 = 0 and the Weierstrass\n\n\f4\nfunction becoming a simple rational function P (t, 0, 0) = 1/\u03c42\nleading to the solution\np(\u03c4) =\n\n1 \u2212 2\u03c42\n1 + 4\u03c42\n\n(20)\n\nFor long times the solution reaches the value \u22121/2 while\nplin,M = \u22121/2 and < plin >= 1/4 . For positive nonlinearities the localization tendency increases while for negative \u03c7\nwe have first detrapping, complete oscillations for \u03c7 = \u22126 and\n\nC. N > 4\n\nWe observed from the previous three cases that in the dimer\nthe two roots at \u03c7c and \u03c7\u2032c determined two distinct, yet identical in nature, selftrapping transitions. In the trimer \u03c7\u2032c was\nresponsible for the hyperbolic transition, \u03c7c for trigonometric evolution, while the fact that the two roots were equal in\nthe tetramer turned the (unique) transition to an algebraic one.\nThe (negative) roots \u03c7c and \u03c7\u2032c \"collide\" in the tetramer and\nwe observe that their role changes for N > 4. Specifically, we\nfind that |\u03c7\u2032c | > |\u03c7c |, with the algebraic transition occurring at\n\u03c7c while at \u03c7\u2032c we have a specific trigonometric evolution.\nFor negative nonlinearities as we increase in absolute value\n\u03c7 we have initially detrapping, complete oscillatory motion\nfollowed by subsequent reduction of the amplitude of the motion that leads to the hyperbolic transition at \u03c7c . This state\ndoes not populate equally at long times the sites of the N-mere\nas in the cases for N = 2, 3, 4; the asymptotic population of\nthe initially excited site is now larger than that of the other\nsites. Further increase of |\u03c7| leads to periodic motion with increasing amplitude reduction. As the nonlinearity parameter\ncrosses the value \u03c7\u2032c = \u22122N the dynamics becomes trigonometric while, at the same time the amplitude of oscillation\nbecomes identical to that of the corresponding linear N-mere.\nThus at \u03c7\u2032c the nonlinear system behaves identically to the corresponding linear one in what regards the site probabilities,\nnevertheless the evolution is done with different frequency.\nFurther increase of nonlinearity leads to more localization.\nThe value of \u03c7c is determined numerically from the solution of the cubic equation g(\u03c7c ) = 0; the values obatained\ncoinside with those found in ref. [10]. We observe that as N\nincreases this root separates from the one at \u22122N and asymptotically reaches the value \u2212N. Thus in a very large system\nwe expect to have the hyperbolic selftraping at nonlinearity\n\np(\u03c4) = 1 \u2212\n\nsubsequent asympotic equipartition at \u03c7 = \u22128 with the transition being now algebraic as seen in Eq. (20). Further absolute\nincrease of \u03c7 produces nonlinear localization. We note that\nas in the trimer also in the present case at \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032c we have an\nasymptotic equipartition of the probability on all four sites; in\nthat sence we could use the term \"selftrapping\" meaning however the asymptotic and irreversible onset of equal probability\non all sites.\n\nvalues of order \u2212N while at \u22122N the nonlinear system behaves as the corresponding linear one with renormalized frequency. We also observe that the system reaches a regime of\ncomplete oscillations for \u03c7\u2032 = \u22122(N \u2212 1) while \u03c7\u2032 \u2264 \u03c7\u2032c \u2264 \u03c7c |.\n\u2032\nFor N >\n\u223c 15 the equality for \u03c7 does not hold any more and\nthe system begins to execute incomplete oscillations reaching\na maximum at \u03c7\u2032 <\n\u223c \u03c7c . Thus, while for N < 14 the particle first reaches complete delocalization and at a later stage\nrelaxes hyperbolicaly, for N >\n\u223c 15 the two phenomena occur\nalmost for the same \u03c7-value, first reaching a maximum in the\ndelocalization and subsequently, for infinitesimal change in\nthe \u03c7-value, hyperbolic-type evolution. In this last regime the\nmaximum excursing occurs for \u03c7 very close to the hyperbolic\ntransition value \u03c7c .\nThe exact expression for the evolution at the trigonometric\ntransition at \u03c7\u2032c = \u22122N for N > 4 is given by:\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n4 \u2212 6N + N 2 + 2(N \u2212 2) cos\nN(N \u2212 4)\u03c4\nh\n\u0010p\n\u0011i\np(\u03c4) =\nN N \u2212 2 \u2212 2 cos\nN(N \u2212 4)\u03c4\n\nThe oscillation extends from pmax = 1 to pmin = (N 2 \u2212 8N +\n8)/N 2 ; these values are identical to the one obtainned for the\nlinear MF limit. Thus, in the MF limit of the DNLS equation there are two values of the nonlinearity parameter, viz.\n\u03c7 = 0 and \u03c7\u2032c at which an initially localized excitation oscillates trigonometrically with the same amplitude, but with\ncompletely differenent frequencies. In the second case, the finite value of nonlinearity is equivalent to a \"polaronic\" dressing of the excitation leading to a smaller oscillation frequency\ncompared to the purely linear oscillation at \u03c7 = 0.\nThe hyperbolic transition at \u03c7c is given, on the other hand,\nby\n\n24(N \u2212 1)\nh\ni\n12c 1 + sinh2 [3\u221a3c\u03c4] + \u03c7c 2 + 2(N \u2212 2)\u03c7c + N 2\n\nwhere c is the value of the double root of the discriminant\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nof the equation x3 \u2212 g2 x \u2212 g3 = 0 while the other root is equal\n\n\f5\npH\u03a4L\n1.0\n\npH\u03a4L\n1.0\nHbL\n\nHaL\n\n0.5\n\nmore difficult.

The exact solution of the nonlinear model for\narbitrary N shows thus very interesting features of detrapping,\nhyperbolic relaxation as well as effective linearization of the\nnonlinear system. As the network size N grows, these interesting fearures appear for increasingly larger values of the nonlinearity parameter |\u03c7|, a feature that makes their observation\n\n55\n\n60\n\nN\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Plot of the values \u2212\u03c7c (red) and \u2212\u03c7\u2032c (green)\nas a function of the network size for two regions: Left panel, for\nN < 12 and right panel for 50 < N < 60.

In the linear case (\u03c7 = 0) the presence of the long\nrange bonds leads to localization that increases with N [1].\nAs focusing nonlinearity is turned on we observe initially a\ntendency for detrapping, i.e. the particle executes oscillations\nof larger amplitude that can reach complete or partial (N >\n\u223c 15)\nescape from the initially populated site.\nThe time dependence of the system is typical of elliptic\nfunction dependence, viz. periodic oscillatory motion that\nincludes an infinite number of frequencies. This time dependence changes for two specific values of the nonlinearity parameter at \u03c7c and \u03c7\u2032c respectively. For the former value\nthe time evolution becomes hyperbolic (except in the trimer\nwhere the hyperbolic evolution occurs at \u03c7\u2032c ) and periodic motion ceases at long times. In the well studied case of N = 2,\nthe state for this critical nolinearity separates periodic delocalized from localized motion and we have selftrapping. For\nN = 3, 4, while there is no such separation in the hyperbolic\ntransition, there is asymptotic equipartition of probability for\nthis value. For N > 4 the hyperbolic solution at \u03c7c simply represents an asymptotic state where motion ceases while the initially populated site retains most of the probability, a tendency\nthat increases with N. Thus, if by \"selftrapping\" we mean\nthe separation of delocalized to localized motion then, strictly\n\n\f6\nspeaking, it only occurs in the dimer case. On the other hand\nwe may extend the term to include the case where asymptotic\nequipartition of probability takes place; in this case the symmetric trimer and tetramer also qualify, but not networks with\nlarger number of sites.\nA new feature appears at \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032c (\u03c7 = \u03c7c in the trimer); the\nelliptic function evolution becomes trigonometric and the infinite set of frequencies it encompasses collapses to a single\none. Additionally, for N > 4, the amplitude of the oscillation\nbecomes identical to the corresponding one for \u03c7 = 0. Thus\nthe evolution at p\n\u03c7\u2032c is effectively linear but with a new frequency equal to N(N \u2212 4) (for N > 4) while in the purely\nlinear case the frequency is N [1]. If we think that the nonlinear term stems from the coupling with additional degrees of\nfreedom [12] then the evolution becomes more sluggish since\nthe particle is dressed and carries with it the additional degrees\nof freedom. It is remarkable that such a dressing leading to\n\n[1] F. Perakis and G. P. Tsironis, Phys. Lett. A 375, 676 (2011).\n[2] J.C. Eilbeck, P. S. Lomdahl and A. C.

In the large-N limit the two frequencies approach\none the other.\nAs the size of the system increases we observe two distinct\nfeatures, one at \u03c7c \u223c \u2212N where time-hyperbolic behaviour\ntakes place while at \u03c7\u2032c = \u22122N where we have an effective\nlinearization of the motion. Both features appear after the initial detraping and retraping has occurred as a function of |\u03c7|.\nThe onset of nonlinear localization is typically associated with\ndiscrete breather solutions that are localized in space and time\nperiodic. The case for \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032c found here would then correspond to a \"linear breather\", i.e. a localized nonlinear solution\nwith exact trigonometric evolution. It would be interesting to\nfind out if a similar situation can occur in other discrete nonlinear systems as well.\n\n267 (1993).\n[8] J. D. Andersen and V. M. Kenkre, Phys. Stat. Sol.
