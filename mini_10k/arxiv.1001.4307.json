Alfv\u00e9n wave resonance is one of the most effective\nmechanisms to explain the dynamics of the spicules and the sufficient energy flux\nto heat the corona.\nSubject headings: Sun: corona - Sun: granulation - Sun: oscillations - Sun:\nphotosphere - Sun: solar wind - Sun: transition region\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrom the time the solar corona was found to be at a temperature of more than 1\nmillion K (Edl\u00e9n 1943), the search for the process that heats the corona, so called coronal\nheating problem, has become one of the most important problems in the solar physics.\nIt is known that mechanical energy transport is required to heat the corona because the\nphotospheric temperature is at most 6,000 K. Since large amount of mechanical energy flux\ncan be generated by the photospheric convection motion, the essential problem is how to\ntransport the mechanical energy to the corona and how to dissipate it in the corona. The\nmechanisms that heat the actual corona are yet to be elucidated, since it is difficult to\nself-consistently include all the energy transport process.\nIt is required that the heating rate of any coronal heating mechanisms must balance\nthe energy loss by radiative cooling and thermal conduction in order to maintain the 1\nmillion K corona. The energy flux necessary to heat the quiet corona is 3 \u00d7 105 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 (Withbroe & Noyes 1977). There are two mechanisms that are widely believed to heat\nthe corona. There are the Alfv\u00e9n wave heating model (Uchida & Kaburaki 1974; Wentzel\n1974), and the the nanoflare model (Parker 1988). Both models explain how to release\nPoynting flux generated by the photospheric convection motion.\nIn the Alfv\u00e9n wave heating model, magnetoacoustic waves driven by the convection\nmotion propagate upward to produce shocks. Damping length of compressional waves such\nas fast or slow mode waves is very short because of the highly stratified atmosphere in the\nSun. Moreover the diffraction due to the gradient of Alfv\u00e9n speed prevents compressional\nwaves from propagating to the corona. Therefore it is considered that it is not possible to\nheat the corona by these compressional waves (Hollweg 1981). On the other hand, Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves are non-compressional waves, so they can reach the corona even if the atmosphere\nis highly stratified. Damping length of Alfv\u00e9n modes is defined by various dissipation\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nprocesses such as nonlinear mode conversion (Hollweg et al. 1982; Kudoh & Shibata 1999;\nSuzuki & Inutsuka 2005, 2006) , Alfv\u00e9n wave resonance (Ionson 1978), and phase mixing\n(Heyvaerts & Priest 1983). Alfv\u00e9n wave resonance also occurs when a flux tube between\nthe photosphere and the chromosphere acts as an Alfv\u00e9n wave resonant cavity, this can\nhappen even if it is not closed (Hollweg 1981; Leroy 1981). Since a large amount of the wave\nflux is reflected by the transition region, standing waves appear in the region between the\nphotosphere and the transition region. These standing waves can be amplified depending\non the wave frequency excited at the wave source and they can eventually be dissipated\nnonlinearly. It is not understood yet which processes can act efficiently in the real solar\ncorona.\nVarious studies have been made to investigate the nonlinear propagation of Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves using numerical simulations. Moriyasu et al. (2004) and Moriyasu & Shibata (2004)\nstudied the dissipation process of Alfv\u00e9n waves in coronal loops. In their models, shear\nAlfv\u00e9n waves are driven by footpoint motion, and are coupled nonlinealy with fast and slow\nmode waves during propagation in the chromosphere and the corona. They suggested that\nAlfv\u00e9n waves can create 1 million K corona when the r.m.s velocity of the footpoint motion\nis greater than 1 km s\u22121 . For open flux tubes, Kudoh & Shibata (1999) showed that Alfv\u00e9n\nwave heating model can also explain the spicule motion as well as it can transport sufficient\nenergy flux to heat the corona. Moreover, Suzuki & Inutsuka (2005, 2006) showed that\nnonlinear low-frequency Alfv\u00e9n waves can simultaneously heat the corona and drive the fast\nsolar wind.\nOne issue with the above simulations is the wave generation in the photosphere.\nBecause there were only few observations on the time series of transverse motion at the\nphotosphere (Tarbell et al. 1990), the previous simulations assumed an artificial velocity\nspectrum for wave generation. As both the total power and the shape of the velocity\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nspectrum can affect the wave generation and the heating process, it is necessary to use\nobservational data to justify whether Alfv\u00e9n waves are able to heat the corona.\nIt is possible to observe turbulent convection motion in the photosphere by Doppler\nanalysis. Temporal velocity profiles for the vertical motion have been studied for the\nsake of helioseismology (Harvey et al. 1993). Carlsson & Stein (1997) used the observed\nDoppler velocity as a generation mechanism of acoustic waves and reproduced the Ca II\nspectrum to compare with observations. On the other hand, generation of Alfv\u00e9n waves\nrequires transverse motion in the photosphere. Local correlation tracking (LCT) method\n(November & Simon 1988; Title et al. 1989; Berger et al. 1998) reveals the horizontal\nmotion of the granules. Though many studies have been done on the spatial distribution\nof the horizontal velocity (November & Simon 1988; Berger et al. 1998), few studies have\nbeen performed on the temporal velocity profiles (Tarbell et al. 1990). This is because the\nLCT method is greatly affected by the atmospheric seeing. However, a seeing free data set\ncan be obtained by Solar Optical Telescope, SOT (Tsuneta et al. 2008) on board Hinode\n(Kosugi et al. 2007), so we can clearly understand the properties of the temporal profiles of\nthe horizontal motion through LCT techniques.\nAn important physical process in the Alfv\u00e9n wave dynamics is the spicule dynamics.\nOne of the mechanism of spicule formation is slow mode shock model (Hollweg 1982;\nShibata & Suematsu 1982; Suematsu et al. 1982; Sterling & Hollweg 1988; Sterling 2000).\nSuematsu (1985) applied the slow shock model to fibrils and threads in a loop geometry.\nLeakage of p-mode from the photosphere eventually produce the slow mode shock (Suematsu\n1990; De Pontieu et al. 2004; Hansteen et al. 2006) . These shocks lift up the transition\nregion resulting in spicule motions. However, spicule height cannot reach the observed value\n(5,000-7,000 km) only by the leakage of p-mode (Suematsu 1990). Kudoh & Shibata (1999)\nand Saito et al. (2001) considered the slow mode generation through nonlinear Alfv\u00e9n wave\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nmode conversion. Thanks to Ca II movies observed by Hinode satellite, detailed dynamics of\nthe spicules have been understood (De Pontieu et al. 2007a,b; Rouppe van der Voort et al.\n2009). Kim et al. (2008) and He et al. (2009) estimated the minimum wavelength of kink\nAlfv\u00e9n waves from horizontal motions of spicule. These observation can impose many\nrestrictions on coronal heating models.\nThe purpose of the present study is to include a realistic horizontal velocity spectrum\nin the magnetohydrodynamic simulations and justify coronal heating by Alfv\u00e9n waves in\nthe solar atmosphere. In section 2, we will describe observation method to measure the\nhorizontal photospheric motion. The basic assumptions and our numerical model will be\nexplained in section 3. In section 4 we describe our numerical results and discussion will be\nincluded in section 5. Finally, we will summarize our conclusion in section 6.\n\n2.\n\nObservations & Data Reductions\n\nOne of the main purposes of the Hinode satellite is to solve the coronal heating\nproblem. Among the three telescopes equipped on Hinode, Solar Optical Telescope (SOT)\n(Tsuneta et al. 2008; Suematsu et al. 2008; Ichimoto et al. 2008; Shimizu et al. 2008) is an\noptical telescope which has high spatial resolution (0.\u2032\u2032 2-0.\u2032\u2032 3) depending on wave length.\nSince observations from space are not affected by atmospheric seeing, Hinode makes it easy\nto obtain a seeing free data set over a long time span.\nIn this study, we used fourteen data sets from quiet regions observed with G-band filter\nbetween 2006 October 31 and 2007 December 29. We described the properties of each data\nset in Table 1. The mean time cadence of each data set is less than 35 second. Basically, we\nselected the data sets whose duration is longer than 70 min. Since every data set is selected\nto locate within \u00b1 100 arcsec from the disc center, where the inclination angle is less than\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n6 degrees. Pixel resolution of the CCD is 0.\u2032\u2032 054 and FOV is larger than 512 pixel \u00d7 512\npixel. Figure 1 shows the typical G-band image used in our analysis.\nDark current subtraction and flat-fielding were applied in the standard manner for\nall of the G-band images. There are overall displacements between two images due\nto the solar rotation, tracking error, and satellite jitter. We have calculated the cross\ncorrelation between two consecutive images and derived the displacement that had the\nhighest correlation coefficient. Using the displacement, we have adjusted all the data to an\naccuracy of sub pixel scale.\nGenerally, G-band images also have intensity fluctuations from p mode as well as\ngranular motion. In order to reduce the contribution from p or f modes, we have applied so\ncalled sub-sonic filtering technique (Title et al. 1989) to our data set. The sub-sonic filtering\ntechnique removes the power where \u03c9/k > Vph in Fourier space so that the information\nmoving faster than Vph does not appear in the movie. In the present study, we have selected\nVph = 5 km s\u22121 .\nIn order to obtain the photospheric horizontal velocity, we have applied the LCT\ntechnique to the G-band movies. The LCT techniques developed by Berger et al. (1998)\nuses rectangular subfields or \"tiles\" as a tracer and determines the displacement of tiles\nbetween two images. Since the horizontal velocity derived by the LCT technique usually\ndepends on the size of the tracer, we have fixed the tile size to be 0.\u2032\u2032 4. Using the Fast\nFourier Transform technique, we have estimated the one-sided power spectrum density, P\u03bd ,\nfrom the time series of the photospheric horizontal velocity. The one-sided power spectrum\ndensity is defined as,\n<\n\nV\u22a52\n\n>=\n\nZ\n\n\u03bdmax\n\nP\u03bd d\u03bd,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bdmin\n\nwhere V\u22a5 is the horizontal velocity, and \u03bdmin , \u03bdmax are the minimum and maximum\nfrequencies constrained by the observational sampling time and duration. <> means the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ntemporal average. Power spectrum densities were first calculated at each fixed point, then\nwe averaged over the FOV. Figure 2 shows an example of the power spectrum density in\nthe region # 1 listed in Table 1. The solid line represents the mean power and the dotted\nlines above and below the solid line represent the range of 1 sigma.\nWe have also used Ca II movie observed by Hinode/SOT on 22-Nov-2006 in order to\ncompare apparent motion of spicules with our numerical simulation. The target region is\nthe west limb over the quiet region. Pixel resolution of each image is 0.\u2032\u2032 054 and cadence is\n8 sec.\n\n3.\n\nNumerical settings\n\nThe basic concepts of our simulations are the same as those of Kudoh & Shibata (1999).\nWe consider the nonlinear propagation of Alfv\u00e9n waves driven by photospheric convection.\nThe whole system is described by MHD equations with polytropic index \u03b3 = 5/3, including\ngravity and empirical chromospheric cooling. All physical variables are supposed to be the\nfunction of time t and the distance s along the flux tube measured from the photosphere.\nVector variables are composed of the component along the flux tube (poloidal component)\nand the toroidal direction. We suppose the mean molecular weight to be 1, independent of\nthe plasma status. Moreover the poloidal configuration of the flux tube is assumed to be\nrigid, though the toroidal components of velocity (V\u03c6 ) and magnetic field (B\u03c6 ) are allowed\nto change with time.

We include the chromospheric cooling Lrad\naccording to Hori et al. (1997) only when the plasma temperature is less than 8 \u00d7 105 K.\nThis method involves two processes. For plasmas whose temperature is less than 4 \u00d7 104 K,\nwe implement the empirical cooling for optically thick plasmas (Anderson & Athay 1989;\nSterling et al. 1993),\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nLrad = 4.9 \u00d7 109 \u03c1(s, t), erg cm\u22123 K\u22121 .\n\n(8)\n\nFor plasmas whose temperature is more than 4 \u00d7 104 K and less than 8 \u00d7 105 K, we use the\ncooling for optically thin plasmas (Hildner 1974; Sterling et al. 1993)\nAlthough flux concentrations at the photosphere are on the order of the pressure scale\nheight, they rapidly expand in the upper atmosphere due to exponential decrease of gas\npressure. If we assume mechanical equilibrium between the magnetic pressure of the flux\ntube and the ambient gas pressure, plasma beta is nearly 1 in the photosphere and the\nchromosphere. In order to reproduce such a situation, we assume the same structure of the\nflux tube as that of Kudoh & Shibata (1999),\n\nr=\n\nZ\n\ncos \u03b1ds,\n\n(9)\n\nz=\n\nZ\n\nsin \u03b1ds,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\n\u03b1 = \u03b1t + (\u03b1r \u2212 \u03b1t )fn ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22124H0\n\u03b1r = \u2212 arctan\n,\nr\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1t = \u2212 arctan (z/zd )2 ,\n\n1\nfn = \u2212 {tanh[(z \u2212 0.2zd )/(0.1zd )] \u2212 1}.\n2\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\nH0 is pressure scale height of the photosphere (150 km), zd is equal to 12 H0 (1800 km)\n, and r is the radius of the flux tube (A \u221d r 2 ). The poloidal field Bs is determined by\nBs = B0 (r0 /r)2 , where r0 is the radius of the flux tube at the photosphere (r0 = H0 = 150\nkm), and B0 is defined so that plasma beta equals to 1 in the photosphere (Fig. 3).\nThe initial atmosphere is supposed to be magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with constant\ngravity (g = 2.7 \u00d7 104 cm s\u22122 ). The temperature is taken to be as follows.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nz \u2212 15H0\nT\n,\n= 1 + (ac \u2212 1) 1 + tanh\nT0\n2\n0.5H0\n\n(15)\n\nwhere ac = 300, and T0 is the photospheric temperature (5000 K). The density at the\nphotosphere is supposed to be 2.53 \u00d7 10\u22127 g cm\u22123 . Figure 4 shows the profile of the plasma\nbeta with respect to height in our model atmosphere.\nThe foot point of the flux tube is subjected to an external torque (Ltrq ) so as to drive\nthe Alfv\u00e9n waves. The formulation of the external torque is\n\nLtrq\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nz \u2212 0.75H0\n= \u00d7 F0 \u00d7 1 \u2212 tanh\n.\n2\n0.075H0\n\n(16)\n\nThe amplitude of the torque, F0 , is determined so that the resulting toroidal velocity of\nthe foot point becomes the given velocity time series that reproduces the given velocity\nspectrum.\nThe numerical domain ranges from the photosphere to more than 900 H0 (= 1.35 \u00d7105\nkm). The grid size below 110 H0 from the photosphere is 15 km while the grid size over\n110 H0 becomes 1.01 times larger per grid. Since wave amplitude increases exponentially\nwith height in the stratified atmosphere, we set the gravity to be 0 above 900 H0 in order\nto reduce the effect of reflection at the upper boundary.\nOur numerical scheme is an HLLD approximate Riemann solver developed by\nMiyoshi & Kusano (2005). Since the HLLD scheme has positivity in some situations, this\nscheme is more robust than a Roe-type linear Riemann solver. Moreover this HLLD scheme\nhas good resolution and numerical efficiency. The spatial accuracy obtains 2nd order by\nusing the TVD-MUSCL method while the temporal accuracy obtains 2nd order by using\nthe Runge-Kutta method. We expect that a conservative scheme like the HLLD scheme\ncan capture the shocks better than the non-conservative scheme used in Kudoh & Shibata\n(1999). Conservative schemes are suitable for the situation when Alfv\u00e9n waves are converted\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ninto compressional waves resulting in a lot of shock formation.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nWe have investigated the relation between the initial Alfv\u00e9n wave spectrum and the\nnonlinear behavior of the upper atmosphere. After assuming the model atmosphere, Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves are generated by torque at the foot point of a magnetic flux tube. First of all,\nmonochromatic waves that have 1 km s\u22121 amplitude at the photosphere are generated.\nThen, we have driven Alfv\u00e9n waves that have continuum spectrum with different wave\namplitudes. Finally, the observed velocity spectrum is included in our numerical simulation\nas a wave driver.\nFigure 5 shows the dynamics of Alfv\u00e9n waves in typical case of our numerical simulation.\nPlots in each panel are stacked with time increasing upward in uniform increments of 8.0 s.\nAlthough we only generated toroidal motion, poloidal motion can be seen in the figure. This\nis the result of mode conversion from Alfv\u00e9n waves to slow mode waves. The slow mode\nwaves push up the transition region, which can be observed as spicules (Kudoh & Shibata\n1999).\n\n4.1.\n\nMonochromatic wave\n\nWe generated monochromatic Alfv\u00e9n waves, changing the wave period from 10 sec\nto 750 sec. For each period, the amplitude is fixed to be 1 km s\u22121 and we measured the\nresulting energy flux in the corona (15,000 km) and the height of the transition region.\nFigure 6 shows the relationship between the mean total energy flux measured at the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\ncorona and the wave period. Total energy flux is described as follows;\nF = Vs\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nB\u03c62\nB\u03c6 Bs\n\u03b3\n1\n2\n2\n\u2212\n\u03c1(Vs + V\u03c6 ) +\nPg + \u03c1gz +\nV\u03c6 .\n2\n\u03b3\u22121\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\n(17)\n\nThe dotted line represents the sufficient energy flux to maintain the hot corona , 3 \u00d7 105 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 (Withbroe & Noyes 1977). The vertical solid lines at each data point represent\nthe error bar for 1 sigma. The energy flux starts to decrease rapidly when the wave\nperiod becomes larger than 500 sec. The time span, 500 sec, roughly corresponds to the\nAlfv\u00e9n wave travel time back and forth between the photosphere and the transition region.\nTherefore the waves whose period are longer than 500 sec are canceled out when they come\nback to the photosphere. The waves whose period are shorter than 60 sec also start to\ndecrease their energy flux at the coronal height. In the case of the shorter period Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves, the shorter period longitudinal waves are frequently produced through nonlinear\nmode conversion. Because such waves are large in number and have shorter damping\nlength, a large amount of wave power is dissipated in the chromosphere. Wave periods that\nefficiently heat the corona range from 60 to 500 sec. One of the reason for that is the Alfv\u00e9n\nwave resonance between the photosphere and the chromosphere, which we discuss in detail\nin the following section. The energy flux profile with respect to wave period (Fig 6) clearly\nshows resonant peaks at 300 and 450 sec.\nFigure 7 shows the relationship between the mean transition region height and the\nwave period. In this study the transition region is defined as the region of the atmosphere\nat a temperature of 8 \u00d7 105 K. Similar to the mean energy flux, the waves whose period is\nshorter than 60 sec or longer than 500 sec cannot create the tall spicules that are frequently\nobserved in the real Sun. The transition region height profiles with respect to wave period\n(Fig. 7) also represent the resonant peaks at the 130, 300, 450 sec.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nThe waves that have continuum spectrum\n\nWe have investigated the dependence of nonlinear Alfv\u00e9n wave propagation on the\nspectral shape of the initial waves. Two different wave spectrums, white noise and pink\nnoise, are considered as wave generators. The power spectrum densities P\u03bd defined by\nequation (1) of the white noise and pink noise are proportional to \u03bd 0 and \u03bd \u22121 respectively.\nThe frequency range is limited from 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 Hz in the same way as that of\nSuzuki & Inutsuka (2006). For each spectrum, the amplitude of the waves changes between\n0.1 and 5 km s\u22121 .\nFigure 8 shows the dependence of the total energy flux in the corona on the amplitude\nof the wave. The horizontal dashed line represents the sufficient energy flux to heat the\ncorona. The diamond and asterisk symbols show the case for white noise and pink noise\nrespectively. Generally energy flux at the corona increases with the wave amplitude. In\nwhite noise case, we need a wave amplitude more than 2 km s\u22121 to maintain the hot\ncorona while in the pink noise case, the necessary wave amplitude is more than 1.3 km\ns\u22121 . Pink noise waves heat the corona more efficiently than white noise waves because the\npink noise waves include more power in the lower periods around 300 sec. Around these\nlower period ranges, Alfv\u00e9n wave resonant periods exist. Therefore large amount of energy\nflux can propagate to the corona without reflection. In the case of pink noise, energy flux\nabove the 5 km s\u22121 wave amplitude decreases because a large fraction of the wave energy is\ndissipated in the chromosphere. When the wave amplitude becomes larger, the nonlinearity\nof the waves also becomes also larger. Then the waves experience frequent nonlinear mode\ncoupling and dissipates rapidly.\nFigure 9 reveals the relationship between the transition region height and the amplitude\nof the waves. For the same reason described above, the spicule height is taller in the pink\nnoise case than in the white noise case.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n4.3.\n\nThe waves that have the observed spectrum\n\nWe have derived the photospheric horizontal velocity from the G-band movies by using\nLCT techniques. According to the figure 2, the observed velocity spectrum generally has a\ndouble power law distribution. For the power spectrum density derived from the different\nregions listed in the Table 1, we have performed a the double power law fitting. The fitting\nfunction is described as follows.\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u03bd \u03b1L (\u03bd < \u03bdb )\nP\u03bd \u221d\n\uf8f3 \u03bd \u03b1H (\u03bd \u2265 \u03bd ).\nb\n\n(18)\n\nThe four parameters that define the spectral shape ( square root of the total power,\nq\n< V\u03c62 >, spectral break frequency, \u03bdb , and the two power index, \u03b1L , \u03b1H ) are described in\n\nthe Table 1. In order to distinguish the high and low frequency components, we implement\nthe Fourier filter with a spectral break frequency. As a result, the low frequency components\ncorrespond to the granular motion while the high frequency components correspond to the\ninter granular motion. Since the power spectrum density in high frequency part is much\nsmaller than that of low frequency part, waves driven by the granular motion is likely to be\nimportant for coronal heating.\nThen we have included the observed velocity spectrum listed in the first line of the\nTable 1 into our numerical simulations. In this case, the total energy flux becomes 4.2 \u00d7 105\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and the mean spicule height becomes 4.7 Mm. The results for the other case\n\nin the Table 1 are plotted in the figure 8 and 9 as white circles. Figure 10 is the Fourier\nspectra of the toroidal velocity with height. The color represents the power normalized by\nthe total power at each height. There are at least three resonant peak at 1,3, and 5 mHz.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n4.4.\n\nSynthesized spicules\n\nAlthough our numerical model is just 1 dimensional model along the flux tube, this\nflux tube has a three dimensional structure in real 3 dimensional space. Therefore we can\nsynthesize the spicule motion in 3 dimensional space if we trace the field lines which have\ncool (less than 1 \u00d7 105 K) plasma. In order to include projection effects, synthesized spicules\nare plotted in three different orientations with respect to an observer (see the right panel\nof figure 11). Although three bands of the spicules in figure 11 are synthesized from the\nsame simulation, these spicules are viewed from different angles. The spicule with the white\nband is initially set on the plane that is made by the vertical direction and the line of sight\ndirection, while the spicule with the thin shaded band is initially set on the sky plane. The\nspicule with the thick shaded band is initially set on the plane which is rotated 45 degree\naround vertical axis from the sky plane.\nWe have compared the observed Ca II spicules with the synthesized spicules in the left\npanel of figure 11. We superimposed the snapshot of the synthesized spicules on the Ca II\nimage. Figure 11 is also available as an mpeg animation in the electronic edition of the\nAstrophysical Journal. From the movie, we can easily compare the height and the structure\nof spicules. The height of spicules from the photosphere deduced from the Ca II movie by\neyes are comparable with that of synthesized ones. On the other hands, the movie clearly\nshows that the synthesized spicules are bent due to Alfv\u00e9n wave propagation, although the\nobserved spicules usually have very straight structures. In the movie, white, thin shaded,\nand thick shaded spicules are changed into blue, black and red bands respectively. Although\nour model does not essentially depend on the foot point radius of the flux tube, appearance\nof the spicules can change. So we include the three different cases synthesized from three\ndifferent foot point radius, r0 = 15, 75, 150 km in the online movie.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAlfv\u00e9n wave resonant cavity\n\nAlfv\u00e9n waves are driven by the magneto-convection at the photosphere. The\nprevious studies (Kudoh & Shibata 1999; Moriyasu et al. 2004; Moriyasu & Shibata 2004;\nSuzuki & Inutsuka 2005, 2006) have assumed artificial wave drivers such as white noise\nspectrum because there were few observations of the photospheric temporal spectrum. In\nthe present study, we include the observed disturbance into our numerical simulations.\nTo investigate the dependence of coronal heating on the wave period, we have\nimplemented a parameter survey on the wave period. As a result, we have found that the\nwaves of period around 100-500 sec can transport the large amount of wave energy to the\ncorona. These special period waves are also found to make the height of the transition\nregion taller. Since the observed spectrum has large power around 300 sec, it is more\nefficient for coronal heating and spicule formation over white noise spectrum. Antolin et al.\n(2008) also reported that the coronal temperature becomes highest when they generate the\nmonochromatic Alfv\u00e9n waves of the period of 300 sec.\nThe reason for the response of our model atmosphere against the special wave periods\nis considered to be Alfv\u00e9n wave resonance between the photosphere and the transition\nregion. Linear analysis by Hollweg (1981) and Leroy (1981) suggested that the Alfv\u00e9n wave\nresonance can occur even when the flux tube is not closed but opened. In the present\nstudy, our bottom boundary works as a reflective boundary since we have imposed the rigid\nboundary at the photosphere. The transition region also becomes a reflective boundary\nbecause the Alfv\u00e9n speed increases rapidly. Therefore standing waves appear in the region\nbetween the photosphere and the transition region and the standing waves will acquire\nlarger amplitude by Alfv\u00e9n wave resonance.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nLet us examine the linear properties of Alfv\u00e9n resonance in a flux tube in our model\natmosphere by assuming a small wave amplitude using the same 1.5D MHD simulations.\nWe assume small amplitude waves with white noise spectrum to check the Alfv\u00e9n wave\nresonance. Figure 12 is Fourier spectrum of the toroidal velocity and it clearly shows\nresonant behavior. The color represents the normalized power of the toroidal velocity at\neach height. The fundamental mode appeared around 1 mHz while the second harmonics\nappeared around 3 mHz. There are a lot of higher harmonics below 300 sec. Since the\nheight of the transition region changes according to the wave property, resonant frequency\nwill also change depending on the situation in the real Sun. When we include the observed\nvelocity spectrum, the fundamental mode, \u223c 1000 sec, has biggest power through the whole\natmosphere. If the Alfv\u00e9n wave resonant cavity actually exists, the resonant periods are\nexpected to be observed as spicule motion or coronal transverse velocity.\nIn our simulation, the photospheric boundary is a fixed boundary by definition while\nthe transition region works as a free boundary because of the high Alfv\u00e9n velocity at\nthe corona. This means that the resonance occurs between the node (photosphere) and\nantinode (transition region). If, for simplicity, we assume the constant Alfv\u00e9n velocity (VA )\nin the resonance region , the resonance frequency \u03c9n can be described as follows,\n\u03c9n =\n\nVA\n(2n \u2212 1) , (n = 1, 2, 3...),\n4L\n\n(19)\n\nwhere L is the transition region height. When L equals to 2,000 km, and VA equals to 8 km\ns\u22121 , resonance frequency becomes, 1,3,5 ... mHz. These frequencies agree quite well with\nour numerical experiments (Figure 12).\nIn the present study, we assume a reflective boundary at the photosphere. This\nassumption may not be valid if the flux tube extends straight down below the photosphere.\nHowever in the sub-photosphere, Alfv\u00e9n speed may be smaller than in the upper atmosphere\nand the flux tube can be easily bent by convection motion. In that case, the wave\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nreflection can eventually occur at some point along the flux tube due to inhomogeneity\nof phase speed, resulting in a change in the resonant frequency. In order to confirm the\nboundary effect, we performed another simulation including the subphotospheric layer\nwhere the Alfv\u00e9n velocity decreases exponentially with depth. It was found that even if\nthe additional subphotospheric layer exists, Alfv\u00e9n wave dynamics and energetics do not\nchange qualitatively or quantitatively.\n\n5.2.\n\nPhotospheric horizontal velocity spectrum\n\nWe have investigated the granular motion by using LCT techniques for 14 different\nregions. LCT techniques require a stable data set with no effects from atmospheric seeing.\nThe spatial resolution of Hinode/SOT is the highest of space optical observation of the\nSun. For example, Solar Optical Universal Polarimeter (SOUP) aboard Spacelab 2 was a\ntelescope with 30 cm aperture (Title et al. 1986) while Hinode/SOT is a telescope with 50\ncm aperture. Although some ground-based observations have higher spatial resolution than\nthat of Hinode/SOT, there are few data sets of this quality even if adaptive optics are used.\nIn general, the results obtained in the present study are almost the same as that\nof Tarbell et al. (1990). We want to note that the derived LCT velocity is the apparent\nvelocity, even though we have carefully removed the effect of p-mode. G-band intensity\ncontrasts are considered to change due to the destruction of CH molecules when the plasma\ndensity decreases or the temperature increases (Steiner et al. 2001). It is possible that\nthe LCT velocity includes these intensity contrasts as well as the granular motion. Since\nrecent realistic 3D simulation (Stein & Nordlund 1998; Carlsson et al. 2004) succeeded\nin reproducing granular motion, detailed comparison of LCT velocity with the simulated\nvelocity should be investigated in the future. In order to avoid the ambiguity of LCT\nvelocity, it is possible to calculate velocity by feature tracking (Berger et al. 1998;\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nMuller et al. 1994) but we do not consider this method.\nAnother possibilities to generate the Alfv\u00e9n waves are rapid changes in the magnetic\ntopology caused by reconnection or interaction between flux tubes and acoustic waves coming\nfrom ambient non-magnetic atmosphere (Hasan et al. 2005; Hasan & van Ballegooijen\n2008). Recent observations reveals that granular-sized transient horizontal fields are\nemerging in quiet region (Ishikawa et al. 2008). Isobe et al. (2008) found from 2D and\n3D MHD simulation that the high frequency Alfv\u00e9n waves can be created by magnetic\nreconnection between these transient fields and ambient vertical fields.\nOnly the toroidal velocity is included in our simulations whereas the observed velocity\nis lateral. This may suggest that we should include the rotation of the observed velocity\nrather than lateral one. However, the basic equation of lateral motion is the same as that of\ntoroidal motion except for the centrifugal force term. Since the centrifugal force turned out\nto be negligibly small in our simulations, it is valid to use troidal motion as a wave driver.\n\n5.3.\n\n1.5 D approximation\n\nWe have assumed a 1 dimensional model along the flux tube from the photosphere to the\ncorona. Generally, there should be leakage of Alfv\u00e9n wave energy in the flux tube through\nthe conversion to fast mode waves. Moreover, in the real Sun, there appears to be other\nmulti-dimensional effects such as Alfv\u00e9n & fast mode coupling by field bending (Wentzel\n1974), phase mixing (Heyvaerts & Priest 1983), and Alfv\u00e9n wave resonance (Ionson 1978).\nThe synthesized spicules have bending structures due to Alfv\u00e9n wave whereas the observed\nspicules usually looks very straight. Indeed, wave lengths of kink Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating\nalong spicules are estimated to be more than 45,000 km (Kim et al. 2008) or 2,000-4,000\nkm (He et al. 2009). Since the bending structures in our simulation are usually \u223c 1,000 km,\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nthere should be another dissipation mechanism of Alfv\u00e9n waves in multi-dimensional space.\nOne possibility for multi-dimensional dissipation that can be suggested by our\nsimulations is instabilities due to the standing waves (Heyvaerts & Priest 1983) in the\nAlfv\u00e9n wave resonant cavity. Shear flows at the antinodes of the standing waves can drive\nthe Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, causing them to decay in a few periods. Moreover, current\ndensity at the nodes of the standing waves can cause the tearing mode instability. How\nmuch energy can be dissipated in such mechanisms will be interesting topics for future\nstudy.\nIf there is greater Alfv\u00e9n waves dissipation in the chromosphere than the present\nmodel, the spicule heights must be reduced to some extent due to decrease in nonlinearity.\nAlthough pure p-mode injection cannot explain the realistic spicule height (Suematsu 1990),\np-mode may be candidate for additional momentum in spicules. Slow modes can be created\nby reconnection (Takeuchi & Shibata 2001) or convective collapse (Steiner et al. 1998;\nTakeuchi 1999). Nagata et al. (2008) observed the transient down flows with intensification\nof the field strength predicted by the model of convective collapse. These down flows are\nexpected to be bounced back to the upper atmosphere, resulting in a wave source for slow\nmode (Sterling & Hollweg 1988, 1989).\nRecently, various simulations for nonlinear MHD wave propagation in multi-dimensional\nspace have been done. Shibata (1983) studied the nonlinear propagation of magnetoacoustic\nwaves in the solar chromosphere in 1D/2D space and found that 1D approximation is\nreasonable when the plasma beta is lower than unity. The propagation of nonlinear Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves were studied as a mechanism for solar and astrophysical jets (Shibata & Uchida\n1985). For coronal heating problem, Hasan et al. (2005) and Hasan & van Ballegooijen\n(2008) implemented the 2-D simulations of magnetoacoustic waves propagating in a flux\ntube. Moreover, Stein & Nordlund (1998) found the bending and horizontal displacement\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nof a flux sheet through the coupling with the convective motion self-consistently with\nradiative MHD code. These calculations only include the region below the chromosphere\nbecause the dynamical time scale becomes very short in the corona. Although recent 3D\nMHD simulations including the corona with fine spatial resolution can sufficiently resolve\nthe wave dissipation and include the physics such as thermal conduction or radiative\ntransfer (Gudiksen & Nordlund 2005; Leenaarts et al. 2009), it is worthwhile investigating\n1D simulation to understand nonlinear wave propagation.\n\n5.4.\n\nEnergy equation\n\nWhen we want to precisely investigate the energy transfer between the photosphere and\nthe corona, it is necessary to include radiative transfer and thermal conduction. The cooling\ntime in the photosphere and the chromosphere changes from 1 - 1,000 sec depending on\nheight (Stix 1970) while we assume a constant cooling time in the present study. Therefore\nthe distribution of the temperature could be changed if we properly include radiative loss.\nThough the compressional mode waves are affected by radiative damping, it is inferred that\nnon-compressional modes like Alfv\u00e9n waves are not significantly damped. Moreover, since\nthe cooling time in the chromosphere (\u223c 200 sec) is much longer than the Alfv\u00e9n crossing\ntime (\u223c 20 sec), the chromospheric dynamics of our simulation would not be greatly affected\nif radiative transfer was included.\nThermal conduction is not so important as long as we are interested in the spicule\ndynamics. In our model, spicules are created by collision between transition region and\nslow mode shocks. The slow mode shocks are generated by nonlinear mode conversion from\nAlfv\u00e9n waves in the chromosphere. These formation process of spicules must not be affected\nby thermal conduction because the chromosphere is too cool. Thermal conduction become\nimportant when we want to study the energy balance in the corona or the transition region.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nSuzuki & Inutsuka (2005, 2006) performed similar simulations to ours but including\nthermal conduction and radiative cooling. Their model succeeded in maintaining the\ncorona and driving the fast solar wind by nonlinear low-frequency Alfv\u00e9n wave. Since the\nobserved photospheric velocity spectrum is similar in shape and total power to the wave\nspectrum assumed in Suzuki & Inutsuka (2006), their model can maintain the corona when\nincluding the observed velocity spectrum. However the plasma beta in the photosphere\nand the chromosphere is very large in their simulation, therefore the dynamics, such\nas spicule motion, must be different. It is necessary to assume more realistic magnetic\nfield distribution along the flux tube to explain spicule formation and coronal heating\nsimultaneously.\nCarlsson & Stein (1997) derived the Ca II spectrum by using hydrodynamic simulations\nwith non-LTE radiative transfer. In order to compare simulated results with observations,\nit is important to synthesize the spectrum during or after the simulations. Numerical\nsimulations with radiative transfer are also needed when we solve the convection layer.\nMagnetic intensification through convective collapse and flux tube buffeting by convection\nmotion can be included self-consistently by the radiative MHD simulations (Steiner et al.\n1998).\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have investigated the nonlinear evolution of Alfv\u00e9n wave propagation along a flux\ntube in the solar atmosphere. In particular, we have concentrated on the dependence\nof the energy flux transmission and the spicule formation on the Alfv\u00e9n wave period.\nMonochromatic Alfv\u00e9n waves with given amplitude or Alfv\u00e9n waves that have continuum\nspectrum with various amplitudes are generated in our model atmosphere. Moreover we\nhave analyzed the photospheric horizontal velocity spectrum from G-band movies and\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nincluded the spectrum in our numerical simulations. The results obtained in this paper are\nsummarized as follows;\n\n1. The region between the photosphere and the transition region can be an Alfv\u00e9n wave\nresonant cavity. When including the observed velocity spectrum, we have obtained at\nleast three resonant frequencies, 1,3, and 5 mHz. The Alfv\u00e9n waves that have resonant\nfrequencies transfer more energy to the corona and increase the spicule height.\n2. Pink noise (P\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 ) has an advantage for coronal heating over white noise (P\u03bd \u221d \u03bd 0 ).\nAlfv\u00e9n waves generated by pink noise also increase the spicule height.\n3. The photospheric horizontal velocity spectrum has larger power around 3 min than\npink or white noise. The power around 3 min or more comes from granular motion\nwhile the high frequency components come from inter-granular motion.\n4. The observed velocity spectrum has an advantage for coronal heating over white\nnoise. Obtained energy flux is 4.2 \u00d7 105 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , which means that Alfv\u00e9n waves\ntransfer sufficient energy to heat the quiet corona.\n5. Structures of spicules synthesized from our numerical simulation are bending more\nthan observed Ca II spicules. This implies the dissipation of Alfv\u00e9n waves by\nmulti-dimensional effects that are not included in our simulations.\n\nHinode is a Japanese mission developed and launched by ISAS/JAXA, with NAOJ as\ndomestic partner and NASA and STFC (UK) as international partners.
