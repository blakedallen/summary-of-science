A discussion\nis given of background reduction by: material selection, detector segmentation, pulse shape\nanalysis, and electro-formation of copper parts and granularity. Predictions of the experimental\nsensitivity are given. For an experimental running time of 10 years over the construction and\noperation of Majorana, a sensitivity of T1/0\u00012 ~4\u00011027 y is predicted. This corresponds to\nm\u0002 ~ 0.03\u0001 0.04 eV according to recent QRPA and RQRPA matrix element calculations.\n\n\fIntroduction\nThe neutrino mass range of interest favored\nby the results of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments is now well within the grasp of a\nwell-designed germanium (76Ge) zero-neutrino\ndouble-beta decay (0\u0005\u0003\u0003-decay) experiment.\nThe observation of this decay mode would be\nthe only known practical experiment to\ndemonstrate that neutrinos are Majorana\nparticles. In the case of Majorana neutrinos,\n0\u0005\u0003\u0003-decay is by far the most sensitive way to\ndetermine the mass scale of neutrino mass\neigenvalues.\nNeutrino oscillation data clearly establish that\nthere are three eigenstates that mix and that\nhave mass. The flavor eigenstates, \u0001 e, \u03bc ,\u0002 , are\nconnected to the mass eigenstates, \u00011,2,3 , via\na linear transformation:\n3\n\n\u0003l = \u0001\n\nj=1\n\nuljL\n\ne\n\ni\u0002 j\n\n\u0003\n\nj\n\n(1)\n\n,\n\nwhere l = e, \u03bc, \u0001 , and the factor e i\u0001 j is a CP\nphase, \u00b11 for CP conservation.\nThe decay rate for the 0\u0005 \u0003 \u0003-decay mode\ndriven by the exchange of a massive Majorana\nneutrino is expressed as follows:\n2\n\n\u00030\u0002\u0002\u0004 = G 0\u0004 (E 0 , Z ) m\u0004\n\n0\u0004\nM 0f \u0004 \u0001 ( g A gV ) 2 M GT\n\n2\n\n, (2)\n\nwhere G 0\u0001 is a factor including phase space\nand couplings, \b m\u0001 \u0007 is the Majorana\nneutrino mass parameter discussed below,\n0\u0001\nare the Fermi and GamowM 0f \u0001 and M GT\nTeller nuclear matrix elements respectively,\nand g A and gV are the relative axial vector\nand vector coupling constants respectively.\nThe mass parameter, \b m\u0001 \u0007 , is the \"effective\nMajorana mass of the electron neutrino.\" After\nmultiplication by a diagonal matrix of\nMajorana phases, it is expressed in terms of\nthe first row of the 3\u00023 matrix of equation (1)\nas follows:\nm\u0003 \u0001\n\nu\n\nL\ne1\n\n2\n\nm1 +\n\nu\n\nL\ne2\n\n2\n\nm2e\n\ni\u0004 2\n\n+\n\nu\n\nL\ne3\n\n2\n\nm3e\n\ni(\u0004 3+\u0002 )\n\n, (3)\n\nwhere e i\u0001 2, 3 are the Majorana CP phases (\u00b11\nfor CP conservation in the lepton sector).\n\nThese phases do not appear in neutrino\noscillation expressions and hence have no\neffect on the observations of oscillation\nparameters. The phase angle \u0004 does appear in\noscillation experiments. The oscillation\nexperiments have, however, constrained the\nmixing angles and thereby the uljL coefficients\nin equation (3). Using the best-fit values from\nthe SNO and Super Kamiokande solar\nneutrino experiments and the CHOZ and Palo\nVerde reactor neutrino experiments, we arrive\nat the following expression [Pas02], [Che03],\n[Bah02], [Avi02]:\ni\u0005 2\n+0.04\nm\u0004 \u0002 (0.75+0.02\n\u00010.04 )m1 + (0.25\u00010.02 )m2e\n\n+(< 0.026)m3e\n\n(4)\ni(\u0005 3+\u0003 )\n\n,\n\nwhere the errors were computed from the\npublished confidence level values. The bound\non ue3 2 is at a 95% CL and the errors on the\nfirst two coefficients are 1\u0006.\nThe results of the solar neutrino and\natmospheric neutrino experiments imply the\nmass square differences \u0002ij2 = | mi2 \u0001 m2j | but\ncannot distinguish between two mass patterns\n(hierarchies): the so called \"normal\"\n2\nhierarchy, in which \u0002msolar\n= m22 \u0001 m12 and\nm1 \u0001 m2 << m3 , and the \"inverted\", hierarchy\n2\nwhere \u0002msolar\n= m32 \u0001 m22 and m3 \u0001 m2 >> m1 .\n\nIn both cases \u0002m2AT \u0003 m32 \u0001 m12 . Considering\nthe values in equation (4), we make the\nsimplifying approximation ue3 2<< ue1,2 2\nand we set ue3 2 \u0001 0. After a few\nstraightforward algebraic manipulations, and\nusing the central values of equation (4), we\ncan write the following approximate\nexpressions [Avi03]\nm\u0002 \u0004 m1\n\n3\n4\n\n\u0005 \u0001m2 \u0007\n+ 41 e i\u00032 1 + solar\n,\n2m12 \b\n\u0006\n\n(5)\n\nfor the case of \"normal\" hierarchy, and,\nm\u0002 \u0004 m12 + \u0001m2AT\n\n3 i\u0003 2\ne\n4\n\n+ 41 e i\u00033\n\n(6)\n\nin the \"inverted\" hierarchy case. There is of\ncourse no evidence favoring either hierarchy.\nIn Table 1a and Table 1b, we show the\n\n\fpredicted central values of \u0006 m\u0001 \u0005 as a function\nof the lightest neutrino mass eigenvalue, m1 .\nThese values define the desired target\nsensitivities of next generation 0\u0003 \u0002 \u0002-decay\nexperiments.

This\ndiscussion will concentrate on a conventional\nmodular design using ultra-low background\ncryostat technology developed by the\nInternational Germanium Experiment (IGEX).\nIt will also utilize new pulse shape\ndiscrimination hardware and software\ntechniques developed by the collaboration and\ndetector segmentation to reduce background.\nThe most sensitive 0\u0003\u0002\u0002-decay experiments\nthus far have been the Heidelberg-Moscow\n[Bau99] and IGEX [Aal02] 76Ge projects that\nset lower limits on T10\u00012 of 1.9\u00011025y and\n1.6\u00011025y respectively. They both utilized Ge\nenriched to 86% in 76Ge and operated deep\nunderground. The projection is that the\nMajorana background will be reduced by a\nfactor of 50 over the early IGEX data prior to\npulse shape analysis (from 0.2\ncounts/keV/kg/y to 0.011 counts/keV/kg/y).\nThis will occur mainly by the decay of the\ninternal background due to cosmogenic\nneutron spallation reactions that produce 56Co,\n58\nCo, 60Co, 65Zn, and 68Ge in the germanium\nby, limiting the time above ground after\ncrystal growth, careful material selection, and\nelectroforming copper cryostats. One\ncomponent of the background reduction will\narise from the granularity of the detector array.\nIn figure 1, an option for a detector\nconfiguration is shown for one module. Each\n\nGeneral Description of the Majorana\nExperiment\nThe proposed Majorana detector is an array\nof Ge detectors with a total mass of 500 kg of\nGe that is isotopically enriched to 86% in\n76\nGe. The final configuration is not fixed;\nhowever, several have been evaluated with\n\nFigure 1. Possible 57-crystal module. Each\ncrystal is contained in its own copper can.\n\nof these modules would have three levels of\nnineteen detectors in close-packed array. Each\ndetector is 62 mm in diameter and 70 mm long\n\n\fwith a mass of ~1.1 kg. In figure 2, an\nalternative cooling option is shown which\nclusters all the detectors in a copper vacuum\nchamber which can then be cooled by\nimmersing the chamber in a vessel of liquid\nnitrogen or in a jacket of cooled gas.\n\nIn the few years since the production of the\n2-kg IGEX intrinsic Ge detectors, the new\ntechnology evolved in the two industrial\ncompanies known to us. Large semi-coaxial ntype detectors have been fitted with a series of\nazimuthal electrical contacts along their\nlength, and one or more axial contacts in the\ncentral hole. A configuration with sixazimuthal-segment by two-axial-segment\ngeometry is shown in Figure 3. After Monte\n\nFigure 3. A Six-by-two twelve-segment\ndetector.\n\nFigure 2. Alternative cooling scheme.\nC\ni\ni\n\nRecent Progress in Ge Detector Technology\nMajorana will not simply be a volume\nexpansion of IGEX. It must have superior\nbackground rejection and better electronic\nstability. The summing of 200 to 250\nindividual energy spectra can result in serious\nloss of energy resolution for the overall\nexperiment. In IGEX, instabilities lead to a\ndegradation of 25% in the energy resolution of\nthe 117 mole-years of data. The collaboration\nhas overcome these problems and the\ntechnology is now available. First, detectors\nelectronically segmented into 12 individual\nvolumes in a single n-type intrinsic Ge\ndetector are available from two companies:\nAdvanced Measurement Technology\n(ORTEC) and Canberra Industries. Second,\ncompletely digital electronics from XIA (Xray Instrumentation Associates) has been used\nby our group to demonstrate unprecedented\nstability, very low energy thresholds (<1 keV)\nfor a 2-kg Ge detector, and a vast\nimprovement in pulse-shape discrimination.\n\nCarlo studies and discussions with detector\nmanufacturers, several configurations are\navailable that the Majorana collaboration\nbelieves strike a good balance between cost,\nbackground reduction, and production\nefficiency. The six-by-two configuration in\nFigure 3 was used in the Monte Carlo\nsimulations that produced the data shown in\nFigure 4 for a single detector. The internal\n60\nCo modeled in the figure is produced by\ncosmic-ray neutrons during the preparation of\n\nFigure 4. Monte-Carlo simulation of internal\n60\nCo background.

Formation begins after the crystal\nis pulled. Its elimination by segmentation and\npulse shape analysis is crucial.\nThe saga of pulse shape discrimination\n(PSD) in the IGEX project has been slow and\npainful, finally culminating in success. Current\ntechniques depend entirely on experimental\ncalibration and do not utilize pulse shape\nlibraries. The ability of these techniques to be\neasily calibrated for individual detectors\nmakes them practical for large detector arrays.\n\ncharacteristic of 0\u0002\u0001\u0001-decay, and the multiplesite interactions characteristic of most gammaray background events near 2 MeV.\nExperimental example pulses are shown in\nFigure 5. An example single-site event from\nthe 1592 keV double-escape peak of the 208Tl\n2615 keV line is shown as the bottom signal.\nThe top signal is an example multi-site pulse\nfrom the full energy peak of the 212Bi line at\n1620 keV.\n\nA major contributor to this success has been\nthe availability of commercial digital\nspectroscopy hardware. Digitizing a detector\npreamplifier signal, all subsequent operations\non the signal are performed digitally.\nProgrammable digital filters are capable of\nproducing improved energy resolution, longterm stability, and excellent dynamic range.\nThe particular unit used in these studies was\nthe 4-channel Digital Gamma Finder (DGF4C) unit developed and manufactured by XIA\nInc.\nThe DGF-4C has four independent, 14-bit 40\nMHz ADCs. The ADCs are followed by Firstin First-out (FIFO) buffers capable of storing\n1024 ADC values for a single event. In\nparallel with each FIFO is a programmable\ndigital filter and trigger logic. The digital filter\nand trigger logic for each channel is combined\ninto a single field programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA). Analog input data are continuously\ndigitized and processed at 40 MHz.\nThe DGF-4C is then a smart filter of\nincoming pulses. If for example, a signal has a\npulse-width incompatible with the usual\ncollection time of 200-300 ns, or is oscillatory\n(like microphonic noise), the filters can be\nprogrammed to reject it. This feature can also\nbe used to allow the very low energy\nthresholds required in dark matter searches as\nwell as eliminating the broad spectrum of\nartificial pulses from high-voltage leaks and\nelectromagnetic interference that can even add\nnoise pulses in the region of 0\u0002\u0001\u0001-decay.\nThe 14-bit ADCs produce pulse forms that\nallow the discrimination between single-site\ninteractions in the detector crystal,\n\nFigure 5. The top pulse is due to a multiplelocation ionization deposit. the bottom pulse is\ndue to a localized deposit.\n\nUltimate Sensitivity of the Majorana\nExperiment\nTo estimate the sensitivity of the Majorana\nexperiment we begin with the published\nspectrum from an enriched IGEX germanium\ndetector that had been operated under 4000\nmeters water-equivalent (mwe) shielding from\ncosmic rays [Bro95]. The components of the\nbackground were computed based on the use\nof validated spallation mechanisms and rates\n[Avi92]. The computed rate in the region of\ninterest (Rc = 0.29 counts/keV/kg/yr) from the\nspallation isotopes actually exceeded the\nexperimentally measured count rate (Re = 0.1\ncounts/keV/kg/yr). Therefore, a conservative\nestimate of 0.2 counts/keV/kg/yr has been\ntaken as an intermediate value. In practice,\nlower values would be possible by keeping\nhigh-energy neutrons away from the raw\nenriched material and by fabricating the\ndetector underground.\n\n\fTable 2. Estimation of sources of activity from early IGEX data and predicted Majorana\nbackground.\nSpallation T1/2 (d)\nIsotope\n68\nGe\n270.82\n56\nCo\n77.27\n60\nCo\n1925.2\n58\nCo\n70.82\nTotal\n\nRate from\nAfter\n[Bro95]\nConstruction\n0.1562\n0.03702\n0.0238\n0.00212\n0.0177\n0.01294\n0.0024\n0.000202\ncts/keV/kg/y cts/keV/kg/y\n0.2\n0.0523\n\nIt is instructive to scale the count rate of the\nprevious experiment to that of the initial\nMajorana plan, a 500 kg detector operated for\n10 years. We correct that rate to account for\nthe decay of activities that will occur before\nand during the experiment. Finally, we correct\nthe rate to account for the new technologies\nthat we plan to employ.\nThe detector used for these sensitivity\nestimates had been zone refined, so that the\n60\nCo (T1/2 = 5.2 y) inside the crystal, created by\ncosmic-ray-generated neutrons, was expected\nto be low. But the detector had been above\nground long enough before zone refining to\nreach equilibrium with respect to 68Ge (T1/2 =\n271 d), another important internal\ncontaminant. The first reduction in this\nbackground rate comes from decay during the\nunderground array construction period. This\nhas been calculated using a modest rate of\nproduction and assuming quarterly shipments\nof enriched material during the construction\nperiod.\nDecay during the construction period\nunderground would decrease the 68Ge by an\naverage factor of 0.24 and an additional factor\nof 0.11 during the data acquisition of the\nexperiment. Similarly, 60Co would decay\nduring construction to reduce the count rate to\n0.73 of the original rate by the start of the\nexperiment, and during the ten-year data\nacquisition the average rate during the\nexperiment would be 0.55 times that at the\nbeginning.\nThus, accounting for decay, the average\nbackground rate during the experiment would\n\nRate During\nExperiment\n3.93E-03\n6.43E-05\n7.15E-03\n5.60E-06\ncts/keV/kg/y\n0.0112\n\nTotal in\nROI\n70.15\n1.15\n127.55\n0.10\nCounts\n198.95\n\nAfter PSD\nRejection\n18.59\n0.30\n33.80\n0.03\nCounts\n52.72\n\nAfter Seg\nRejection\n2.57\n0.04\n4.66\n0.00\nCounts\n7.28\n\nbe 0.01 counts/keV/kg/yr. Thus, the effect of\npre-deployment decay is effectively a\nreduction of 94% or a factor of 17.8.\nThe number of 76Ge atoms in 500 kg of\nenriched germanium (86% 76Ge) is N =\n3.41\u00011027. The optimum energy window of \u0002E\n= 3.568 keV is expected to capture 83.8% of\nthe events in a sharp peak at 2039 keV. If\nB = b \u0002 \u0001E \u0002 N \u0002 \u0001t and \u0002t is 10 years, we would\nexpect to observe 199 background counts.\nThe next step in estimating the sensitivity of\nthe experiment is to apply two new but easily\nimplemented techniques. The first is the pulse\nshape analysis technique discussed above.\nThis method has been shown to accept \u0003 PSD =\n80.2% of single site pulses (like double-beta\ndecay) and to reject 73.5% of background. The\nsecond technique involves the electrical\nsegmentation of the detector crystal to form\nseveral smaller segments as discussed earlier.\nA simplified Monte Carlo analysis, assuming\nthe efficiency \u0003 PSD is independent of that of\nsegmentation, \u0003SEG, was carried out only to\ncount the segments with significant energy\ndeposition and reject events with a multiplicity\ngreater than one. This cut accepted \u0003SEG =\n90.7% of double-beta decay pulses and\nrejected 86.2% of backgrounds like 60Co and\n68\nGe, which are highly multiple.\nApplying the background reduction factors\nto the simple calculation above, only 7.28\ncounts of the original 199 counts survive in\nour 3.568 keV analysis window, a reduction of\n96.3% or a factor of 27.3. See Table 2.\nThe estimated background is ~7.3 events,\ntherefore the sensitivity of the experiment is\n\n\f~3.8\u00011027 y at 90% C.L. because we predict\nthat 3.7 events will be the maximum number\nattributable to 0\u0003\u0002\u0002-decay to a 90% C.L. The\ncomputation of the 0\u0003\u0002\u0002 half-life must then\ntake into account this number of observable\ncounts, the cut efficiencies, and the fraction of\nthe 0\u0003\u0002\u0002-decay peak found in the analysis\nwindow. Thus\nln(2) \u0003 N \u0003 \u0001t \u0003\u0004 PSD \u0003\u0004 SEG \u0003 83.8%\n3.72\n27\n= 3.8 \u0002 10 y .\n\nT1/ 2 =\n\n(7)\n\nA standard relation between the half-life and\nthe effective Majorana mass of the electron\nneutrino is:\nm\u0001 =\n\nme\nFN \u0002T1/ 2\n\n,\n\nshortest total time to completion, including\nconstruction. Many details are not considered\nin this estimate, such as increased labor costs,\nincreased detector production costs, etc.\nFigure 6 shows the results of a simple analysis\nwith background rates similar to [Bro95].\nRates of enrichment above 200 kg/y are purely\nhypothetical, but might be reached by\nemploying more than one Russian enrichment\nfacility.\nThis simple analysis shows that a significantly\nreduced schedule is possible with greater\ninvestment in enrichment.\n\n(8)\n\nwhere FN is a nuclear factor computed by\nvarious authors. The variety of nuclear\ncalculations gives a range of observable\neffective Majorana neutrino mass from 0.02\neV to 0.07 eV. Later we present an update of\nthe status of nuclear matrix elements.\nMany other formulations of this sensitivity\ncalculation are possible. For instance, it is\npossible to calculate the expected rate of\nbackground due to cosmogenic isotopes in the\ncrystal assuming many different scenarios\nproducing far less initial background. This is a\nreasonable approach and it would lead to a\nlower starting background. It is possible,\nhowever, to hypothesize away all backgrounds\nwithout regard to the effort involved. We\nchose to start with a known, reproducible\nstarting point so that the result would be\ncredible and attainable. The many details of\nthe technologies involved ranging from lead\nbricks to multi-dimensional parametric pulse\nanalysis are too lengthy to be described here.\nThe calculations in this section have covered\nin some detail the effects of backgrounds on a\n5000 kg-y experiment in which the mass is\n500 kg and the time is 10 years. A completely\ndifferent approach would be to consider ways\nof reducing the time needed to complete the\nexperiment by allowing different total masses\nof enriched material. In this approach, one\nmight optimize not for lowest cost but for\n\nFigure 6. Sensitivity vs. time of the Majorana\nReference Plan using conservative\nbackground assumptions. The upper curve\nassumes a production of germanium of 200\nkg/y for a total of 500 kg. Milestones in halflife are shown at 0.25, 1.0, and 4.0\u00011027 years.\nScatter about the trend lines is due to the\ninteger nature of the Poisson distribution.\n\nExtraction of the neutrino-mass parameter\nfrom double-beta decay half-lives\nThe two key goals of 0\u0003 \u0002 \u0002-decay\nexperiments are: 1) to determine if neutrinos\nare Majorana particles, and 2) to measure the\nneutrino-mass-eigenvalues. The latter requires\nnuclear matrix elements, which must be\ncalculated with specific nuclear models. It is\nnow widely accepted that nuclides that are \u0002\u0002decay candidates, 76Ge, 100Mo, 130Te, and 136Xe\nfor example, are above the nuclear shells\nwhere current versions of the nuclear shell\nmodel are reliable; however, 76Ge is probably\nthe best candidate for future shell model\ncalculations of 0\u0003\u0002\u0002-decay matrix elements.\n\n\fNevertheless, at present we must rely on\nschematic models until the development of\nmicroscopic models is more advanced.\nIn 1986, Vogel and Zirnbauer introduced the\nQuasi-Particle Random Phase Approximation\n(QRPA) [Vog86]. Since then, there have been\nmany developments and variations, frequently\nwith widely disparate results.\nTable 3.

The results\ncan vary by factors of three or more. This is\nnot satisfactory because it does not account for\ntheoretical progress. An example of the\n\nvariation in extracted values is clearly seen in\nTable 3.\nUntil now, conventional wisdom held that\nknowledge of 2\u0004\u0003\u0003-decay decay rates would\nnot be useful in determining 0\u0004 \u0003\u0003-decay\nmatrix elements, because the intermediate\nnuclear states are very different. Recently\nhowever, Rodin, Faessler, Simkovic and\nVogel showed that in the context of QRPA\nand Renormalized QRPA (RQRPA) this is not\nthe case [Rod03]. They make a welldocumented case that:\n\"When the strength of the particleparticle interaction is adjusted so that\nthe 2\u0004\u0003\u0003-decay rate is correctly\nreproduced, the resulting M 0\u0001 values\nbecome essentially independent on the\nsize of the basis, and on the form of\ndifferent realistic nucleon-nucleon\npotentials. Thus, one of the main reasons\nfor variability of the calculated M 0\u0001\nwithin these methods is eliminated\".\nAccordingly, one would conclude that\naccurate measurements of 2\u0004\u0003\u0003-decay halflives will have a very meaningful impact on\nthe predictions of 0\u0004\u0003\u0003-decay matrix elements\nin the same nuclei. Contrary to previous\nconventional wisdom, accurate 2\u0004\u0003\u0003-decay\nmeasurements may now be very important in\nthe realm of neutrino physics.\nRodin et al., investigated the effect of the\nchoice of the single-particle (s.p.) space on\nM 0\u0001 , and also used three different realistic\nnucleon-nucleon interactions utilizing :the\nBonn-CD [Mac89], the Argonne [Wir95], and\nthe Nijmegen [Sto94] potentials. The result is\nthat M 0\u0001 varies very little over the 9 different\ncombinations of s.p.-space and interaction.\nThe effects of neglecting single-particle\nstates further from the Fermi-level were\ninvestigated for 76Ge, 100Mo, 130Te, and 136Xe.\nIn the case of interest here, 76Ge, the three s.p.spaces used were:1) the 9 levels of the\noscillator shells N=3 and4, 2) the addition of\nthe N=2 shell, and finally, 3) the 21 levels\nfrom all states in the shells with N=1, 2, 3, 4,\nand 5. For each change in s.p.-space, the\nresidual interaction must be adjusted by\n\n\fadding a pairing interaction and a particle hole\ninteraction renormalized by an overall strength\nparameter, gph. The value gph~1 was found to\nreproduce the giant Gamow-Teller resonance\nin all cases. Finally, QRPA equations include\nthe effects of a particle-particle interaction,\nrenormalized by an overall strength parameter\ngpp that in each case was adjusted to reproduce\nthe known 2\u0003\u0002\u0002-decay rate correctly. Figure 7\nclearly shows the unprecedented stability\nagainst variations in the model-space and in\nthe realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction used.\n\nthat the Majorana experiment is predicted to\nreach well into the interesting range of\nneutrino mass. Should nature have placed the\nmass below this range, the Majorana array can\nbe expanded and possibly upgraded with\nnewer technology that may emerge, as\nintrinsic Ge detectors can be re-deployed\nmany times in different configurations.\n[Aal02] C.

[Rod03].\n\nFinally, we use these results to compute the\npredicted sensitivity of the Majorana\nexperiment to the effective Majorana mass of\nthe electron neutrino. In the notation of\n[Rod03], \u0006m\u0003\u0005 = [ \b M 0\u0001 \u0007( G 0\u0001 T102\u0001 )1/2] -1. They\ngive \b M 0\u0001 \u0007 = 2.40 \u00b1 0.07 (RQRPA) and\n\b M 0\u0001 \u0007 = 2.68 \u00b1 0.06 (QRPA) with G 0\u0001 =\n0.30\u000110-25 y-1 \u0004 eV-2. If we choose the round\nnumber, T1/0\u00012 = 4\u0001 1 027 y for the predicted\nsensitivity of the Majorana experiment, then\nthe values of the mass parameter\ncorresponding to this half-life are;\nm\u0001 = 0.038 \u00b1 0.007 eV using RQRPA and\n\nm\u0001 = 0.034 \u00b1 0.006 eV with QRPA. A very\nsimilar value, m\u0001 = 0.028 \u00b1 0.005 eV, results\nfrom using the matrix elements from the\nrecent paper by Civitarese and Suhonen\n[Civ03].\nThese values are well within the range of\ninterest tabulated in Table 1, which implies\n\n[Bah02] J.
