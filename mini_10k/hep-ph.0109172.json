They can be used\nto verify (or contradict) existing results. They could set bounds on\nexotic solutions of the solar anomaly (such as \u03bde transitions into sterile neutrinos, into extra-dimensional neutrinos, into anti-neutrinos)\nor on neutrinos with exotic properties (such as a monster decay rate,\nor FCNC interactions, or magnetic moment, or else [11]). They can\ncheck the existence of the MSW effect and the oscillation pattern\nfixed by more precise experiments, or to test solar model predictions,\ndetecting possible short-scale time variations.

A sub-MeV detector able to do different measurements\nbut only with modest accuracy is never relevant to the\nmeasurement of oscillations parameters. Conversely, certain specific sub-MeV measurement could be relevant, if\ndone precisely enough. Near-future experiments are able\nto cover fairly well all the possible cases (often measuring\n\u2206m2 with great precision), and will indicate unambiguously which is the remaining relevant sub-MeV measurement.\n\n2\n\nfor the Boron and Beryllium fluxes are not used (see [21]\nfor a precise description).\nFig. 1 and table 1 illustrate the expected near-future\nachievements.\u2021 In the last column of table 1 we summarize which sub-MeV measurements could provide us with\nfurther, useful information. When a certain sub-MeV measurement is crucial (not very interesting), we mark it by\na '!' ('?'). While \u2206m2 can be often measured very accurately, the determinations of \u03b8 may be less reliable. Indeed, the results on \u03b8 depend strongly on solar-model predictions; they could change e.g. if the Beryllium flux were\nlower than its predicted value. For points outside the LMA\nregion, the error on \u03b8 (and consequently on Pee ) can be\naccurately estimated only after knowing the true results\nof near-future experiments, and could differ by a factor 2\nfrom the values quoted in table 1.\n\nThe near-future situation\n\nWe focus mainly on the oscillations of three active neutrinos, assuming that atmospheric oscillations do not affect\nsolar neutrinos (in the standard notation, this amounts\nto have a large \u2206m2atm and a small \u03b813 ) because the relevant experiments [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]\n(except LSND [17], see page 9) indicate that this is the\nphysically relevant case. A three flavour analysis of solar\n(and atmospheric) data is no longer relevant [18]: reactor\nexperiments [15] directly demand a small \u03b813 < 15\u25e6 at 95%\nCL, so that solar oscillations are presently determined by\nthe usual two parameters, \u2206m2 and \u03b8.\u2020\n\nThe values of \u03b4Pee in the penultimate column of table 1 are the 1 standard-deviation, near-future uncertainty\non the survival probability of the total pp rate, as detected using \u03bde e \u2192 \u03bde\u2032 e\u2032 scattering, with electron kinetic\nenergy larger than Te\u2032 > 0.1 MeV (taking into account the\nsmaller \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 NC cross section, the suppression in the total\nrate due to oscillations is roughly given by 0.8 Pee + 0.2).\nThis quantity is important for sub-MeV experiments [10],\nsince it informs us on how accurately those based on elastic\nscattering (as Heron, Clean, Xmass, Genius, Hellaz,\nThe continuous lines in fig. 1 show the present global etc.) should measure the pp rate.

Therefore, for point A\nwe considered a new reactor experiment, with a baseline\nof 20 km, a rate of 3000 events/year above Ee+ + me >\n2.6 MeV, and used three years of data for the estimate.\nThis experiment has been named 'sub-KamLAND' in table 1 and in the following, because it is less demanding\nIn the rest of the paper we motivate and discuss in than KamLAND. \u00a7\ndetail the results summarized in table 1 and fig. 1.\nDespite the assumed 2% uncertainty on the initial \u03bd\u0304\ne\n\nflux, Pee (and consequently the mixing angle \u03b8) can be\nmeasured with an error less than 2%, if an oscillation signal is seen. In fact, the accuracy in the determination of\nPee depends strongly on its value, being maximal when\n\u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/4. It is possible to detect small deviations from\nmaximal mixing. This can be understood in a qualitative\nway by considering an energy bin around the first oscillation dip, where Pee \u223c 0.

This region\nshould be fully covered by the KamLAND experiment [8],\nwhich will detect reactor \u03bd\u0304e using the reaction \u03bd\u0304e p \u2192 e+ n.\nThe accuracy of KamLAND has been discussed in [24,\n21, 25, 26] and more importantly in [8]. As in [8] we\nassume (too conservatively?) that KamLAND will use a\ncut on visible energy Ee+ + me > 2.6 MeV (where Ee+ =\nE\u03bd \u2212mn +mp ) in order to avoid the background due to ambient \u03bd\u0304e . We assume a rate of 550 events per year without\noscillations, a 2% overall uncertainty on the reactor flux\nand no background. The regions in fig. 1 surrounding the\npoints B, C, D, E show how well KamLAND is expected\nto determine the oscillation parameters \u2206m2 and \u03b8, after three years of data-taking. The value of \u2206m2 can be\nmeasured accurately because the initial spectrum is well\nknown, and the energy resolution is sufficient to show the\n\n\u00a7 Here one crucial question is: if \u2206m2 > 2 10\u22124 eV2 , do we need\n\u223c\nsuch a reactor experiment, or long-baseline experiments will do a\nbetter job? The answer is that even using a neutrino factory beam\nlong-baseline experiments will be unable to measure the solar parameters accurately: see [21] for a discussion. The main reason is\nthat \u2206m212 effects are entangled with effects due to \u03b813 . To disentangle them one need to compare some combination of observables,\ndifferent from the one that gives the highest rate (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc at a baseline of L \u223c 700 km). Detailed studies of neutrino-factory capabilities\nassumed that the solar parameters will be accurately measured by\nother experiments [27].\n\n4\n\n\f(280) events/day for the central value of the Beryllium,\nCNO, pep fluxes predicted by [31] and a background rate\nof 19 (130) events/day, known with \u03b4b = 10% (50%\u00b6 ) error.\nEven if the background were more uncertain, the seasonal\nvariation of the solar neutrino flux (due to the excentricity\nof the earth orbit) would allow a measurement of the signal\nrate with an interesting accuracy [8, 30]. We concentrate\non Borexino and consider only the signal due to the Beryllium line (46 events/day), after three years of running.\n\nat the hypothetical sub-KamLAND than at KamLAND,\nwhere the \u03bd\u0304e are produced by various reactors with different path-lengths, so that the first oscillation dip is partially averaged. (The situation would improve if KamLAND could reconstruct the direction of the neutrinos).\nWe now discuss how sub-MeV experiments could improve on this situation. Solar neutrinos with energy\n\u2206m2\n\u2206m2\nE\u03bd <\n\u223c 2\u221a2G N \u2299 \u2248 1 MeV 10\u22125 eV2\nF e\n\nAt present, it is not clear if it will be possible to measure the CNO and pep contributions, using a sufficiently\nbackground-free energy region above the Beryllium line.\nA pessimistic attitude would require to assume that it\nwill be only possible to use those events with recoil e energy between 0.25 and 0.8 MeV, generated by Beryllium\n(46 events/day), CNO (10 events/day), pep (2 events day)\nneutrinos [9] plus of course the background. However, we\nremark that this possible limitation would be a problem\nto test of solar models, but would have just a little effect\non the determination of \u2206m2 and \u03b8.\n\n(1)\n\n(where Ne\u2299 is the electron density around the region of neutrino production) do not experience the MSW resonance in\nthe sun. Therefore, their oscillation probability is roughly\ngiven by averaged vacuum oscillations, Pee \u2248 1 \u2212 12 sin2 2\u03b8.\nIn first approximation, this implies that sub-MeV experiments have nothing to tell about \u2206m2 , but could give\ninformation on \u03b8. Note however that KamLAND will fix\nthe value of Pee with an error less than \u00b10.02, as shown\nin table 1. Though the precision of sub-MeV experiments\nis ultimately limited by the 1% solar model uncertainty\non the pp flux, it seems unrealistic to aim at this level of\naccuracy, and even difficult to compete with KamLAND\n(or other upgraded reactor experiments). On the other\nhand, with a precise determination of \u2206m2 and \u03b8 from a\nreactor experiment, sub-MeV experiments could be used\nto finally test solar model predictions, as suggested long\ntime ago [28].\n\nWe perform our analysis along the lines of [30], but\npaying more attention to the determination of the oscillation parameters, rather than to the discovery of oscillation signals. We divide the simulated data into Nbins =\n8 + 1 zenith bins (8 night zenith bins equally spaced in\ncos \u03b8zenith, plus one day bin) and define\n\u03c72\n\nReactor experiments can only measure sin2 (2\u03b8): the\ndiscrimination between \u03b8 and \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8 has to be performed\nby relying on matter effects acting on solar neutrinos. The\npresent data prefer \u03b8 < \u03c0/4, with a few standard deviations significance (its precise value depends on the actual\nvalue of \u03b8 and \u2206m2 [26]). Which new experiments are best\nsuited for this issue? Neutrino fluxes are better known at\nlower E\u03bd , but in the LMA region matter effects are larger\nat E\u03bd \u223c 10 MeV than at E\u03bd <\n\u223c MeV. At larger E\u03bd , the\nuncertainty on the Boron flux can be circumvented by the\nNC and CC measurements at SNO (and SK). The NC/CC\nratio today prefers \u03b8 < \u03c0/4 at \u223c 1.5 standard deviations,\nand could provide a direct discrimination in the near future. If \u2206m2 is in the lower part of the LMA region, earth\nmatter effects at SK and SNO [29] could discriminate \u03b8\nfrom \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8. Matter corrections to the spectrum of \u03bd\u0304e\nfrom a future supernova should also give a clear discrimination: unlike \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e cross a resonance if \u03b8 > \u03c0/4.\n\n=\n\nN\nbins\nX\n\n(Ni \u2212 Si \u2212 bBi )2\n+\nNi\ni=1\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u03a67 Be \u2212 \u03a6BP\n(b \u2212 1)2\n7 Be\n+\n+\n,\n\u03b4b2\n\u03b4\u03a6BP\n7 Be\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Ni is the measured number of events; Si is the expected number of signal events (proportional to Pee and to\nthe solar flux \u03a67 Be ); bBi is the expected number of background events (the factor b takes into account the overall\nuncertainty on the background rate). Finally the \u03c72 in\neq. (2) is added to the \u03c72 from present data, properly taking into account the correlation of the theoretical uncertainties on the Beryllium flux [31, 22]. A \u03c72 as in eq.

Borexino data select the SMA region over the other ones, but\nwithout favouring any particular corner there; this selection is done by the other data, that prefer the region of\nlarge \u03b8. We can consider a different possibility: if the CC\nrate measured at SNO is wrong (so that we drop it from\nthe \u03c72 ), but the SK spectral data are correct, the SMA\nrange with small \u03b8 would be selected.

The number of seasonal\nvacuum oscillations Nosc encountered during one semester\nis smaller, so that the accuracy in \u2206m2 is somewhat worse\n(see eq. (5)), but remains much better than sub-MeV capabilities. A measurement of the pp rate would give a\nsolar-model independent information on the mixing angle.\nSome vacuum oscillation 'solutions', usually named \"Just\nSo2 \", that give poor fits of existing data\u2217 present characteristic spectral distortions in pp neutrinos [39]. Our point\nN gives a rather good fit to the data. In fact, the Beryllium line is affected by seasonal effects (while the other\nfluxes are less affected due to their larger energy spread)\nin a way that very strongly depends on \u2206m2 : choosing\nthe appropriate value one can obtain the experimentally\npreferred value of the Beryllium rate.\n\n\u2020 The first SNO spectral data indicate that this is not the case.\nThe final SNO energy spectra are expected to be as significant as\nthose of SK (SK will have more statistics, but the measurable recoil\nelectron energy in SNO is more strongly correlated with the neutrino\nenergy than in SK). In general, we have no reason to suspect that any\nsolar neutrino data be wrong.

In\nfact, Borexino should measure a Beryllium rate 4 standard deviations\nlower than the one predicted by the current best-fit LMA solution,\nin order to make again SMA the 'best' fit solution.\n\n\u2217 We get \u2206\u03c72 \u2248 15, which is in agreement with the analyses in [19],\nexcept the second one. In these 'solutions', Pee deviates from unity\nonly for low energy neutrinos: if the 3 standard-deviation evidence\nfrom SK and SNO against this possibility is correct, new SNO data\nwill soon make it even more disfavoured.\n\n8\n\n\fno oscillations\n\n8\n\nThe zero Beryllium flux required by no oscillations is\ndisfavoured by helioseismology [40], by simple physics considerations, and by recent results. Indeed, solar models [31]\nhave been recently validated by two facts. The determination of S17 (strength of the p7 Be \u2192 8 B\u03b3 reaction) has\nbeen improved [41, 42], and as a consequence the correlation between the flux of Boron and Beryllium neutrinos,\nvisible in fig. 4, will tighten (both neutrino fluxes are controlled by the \u03b13 He \u2192 7 Be\u03b3 reactions; thence the relative S34 -factor remains the dominant, common source of\nuncertainty). Furthermore, the SNO/SK measurement of\nthe Boron flux [7], is in agreement with the solar-model\nprediction, within the \u223c 20 % error. These two facts suggest that the calculated Beryllium flux should not be too\nwrong.\u00a7 Certainly, the solar model independent considerations will become cogent after the Borexino measurement\nof the Beryllium flux.\n\nSK\n\nSNO CC\n\n10\n\n6\nSSM\n4\n\nCl\n\nflux of solar Be neutrinos in 109 cm-2 s-1\n\nand useful solar-model-independent information can be deduced already from existing data [21].\n\n2\nGa\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nflux of solar B neutrinos in 106 cm-2 s-1\n\nIn any case, if something like this were to happen, we\nwould certainly need new experiments to confirm it. The\npp rate should be consistent with no oscillation, because\nSMA predicts Pee \u2248 1 at very low energy. In order to make\nthe solar neutrino anomaly credible, we would need to have\na spectral measurement at low energy, aimed at revealing\nthe sharp SMA transition from Pee \u2248 1 to Pee \u2248 0, for\nenergies around the value in eq. (1).\n\nSince the prediction of the pp flux is very accurate [31]\n\u03a6pp = (5.96 \u00b1 1%)1010 /cm2 s, its determinations will also\nhave an important impact on these analyses. Indeed, a\nwell known simple (though, less accurate) argument leads\nto the same value of the flux. We assume that the solar energy comes from nuclear reactions that reach completion, and that the sun is essentially static over the\ntime employed by photons to reach the surface. The total luminosity of the sun, K\u2299 = 8.53 * 1011 MeV cm\u22122\ns\u22121 at the earth,\nP determines its total neutrino luminosity as K\u2299 =\n\u03b1 (Q/2 \u2212 hE\u03bd\u03b1 i) \u03a6\u03b1 ; Q = 26.73 MeV is\nthe energy released in the reaction 4p + 2e \u2192 4He + 2\u03bde ,\nand the sum extends over the various components (\u03b1 =\npp, pep,7 Be,13 N,15 O, 17F, 8B, hep). Neglecting hE\u03bd\u03b1 i and\nconsidering only the dominant pp flux, one obtains \u03a6pp \u2248\n2K\u2299 /Q = 6.4 * 1010 /cm2 s, that is only 7% off. Therefore,\na measurement of the pp rate, even with modest accuracy, will provide strong solar-model-independent evidence\nagainst (or for) the extreme possibility of no oscillations.\n\nNo oscillations\n\nSterile neutrinos\n\nThe hypothesis of no oscillations can be reconciled with the\ndata if the Boron and Beryllium fluxes are very different\n(smaller) from solar model predictions, as shown in fig. 4;\nsee [21] and ref.s therein. Even in this case, the rates measured by the various experiments are not well compatible\nbetween them. But, as shown in fig. 4, there is a significant (accidental?), partial overlap of the experimental\nvalues.\u2021 This is why solar-model independent considerations cannot strongly disfavour the no-oscillations hypothesis - whereas generically such accident does not happen\n\nThe LSND anomaly can be used to argue for additional\nsterile neutrino(s); however, the evidence against such neutrino(s) is now stronger than the evidence for them. For\nexample, the '2+2' best solution found in [43] where LSND\nis explained has a worse global fit than the 3-neutrino solution where it is not (and consequently than the best\n'3+1' solutions, where the sterile neutrino is of little use\nfor LSND [44]).

The SNO-updated version of this paper has been\npresented in hep-ph/0108073: a small sterile fraction in solar oscillations apparently becomes slighly less disfavoured, because the authors also changed the definition of the \u03c72 for solar SK data. A simplified analysis was performed in V. Barger,\nD. Marfatia and K. Whisnant, Phys. Lett. B509 (2001) 19 (hepph/0106207 version 2). The bound on the sterile fraction in\ntheir fig. 4b gives a reasonably good approximation to the \u2206\u03c72\nvalues obtained from a full fit, if their '1\u03c3' is interpreted as\n\u2206\u03c72 = 4.7 (4 d.o.f.). However stronger bounds on the single\nparameter that tells the sterile fraction can be derived using\na more efficient frequentistic or Bayesian statistical procedure,\nsuch that '1\u03c3' corresponds to \u2206\u03c72 = 1 (in Gaussian approximation).\n[44] W.
