We found that vortices were excluded from the strips when the induction Ba was below a critical\ninduction Bc .

In general, this can be\nattributed both to pinning of vortices by, for example,\ndefects and grain boundaries, and to trapping by the geometric energy barriers. Understanding such pinning and\ntrapping effects is important for superconducting electronics applications.\nThe present work is motivated by applications of highTc superconducting sensors such as SQUIDs2 and hybrid\nmagnetometers based on high-Tc flux concentrators.3\nThese sensors are used in a broad field of applications,\nsuch as geophysical research4 and biomagnetism.5 The\nsensitivity of these sensors is limited by 1/f noise in an\nunshielded environment. The dominant source of this\nnoise is the movement of vortices trapped in the sensor.\nThis noise can be eliminated by dividing the high-Tc body\n\ninto thin strips.2,6 The strips have a certain critical induction below which no vortex trapping occurs, resulting\nin an ambient field range in which these sensors can be\neffectively operated. We investigated vortex trapping in\nthin-film YBCO strips in order to incorporate the results\nin a hybrid magnetometer based on a YBCO ring tightly\ncoupled to, for example, a GMR (giant magneto resistance) or Hall sensor.\nModels for the critical induction of thin-film strips have\nbeen proposed by Clem7 and Likharev.8 Indirect experimental testing of these models was done by observing\nnoise in high-Tc SQUIDs as a function of strip width\nand induction.2,6,9 The induction mentioned here is the\nmagnetic induction during cooling, which is the notation\nthroughout this paper. More direct experimental verification of these models was presented by Stan et al.10\nusing scanning Hall probe microscopy (SHPM) on Nb\nstrips. Both experiment and theory found that the critical induction varied roughly like 1/W 2 . However, the\nexperimental10 and theoretical7,8 pre-factors multiplying\nthis 1/W 2 dependence differed significantly. In this paper we propose a model for vortex trapping in narrow\nsuperconducting strips which takes into account the role\nof thermally generated vortex-antivortex pairs.\nTo test this model we performed scanning SQUID\nmicroscopy (SSM)11 measurements on thin-film YBCO\nstrips. We found excellent agreement between the dependence of critical induction on strip width and the present\nmodel for both our experiments on YBCO and for the\nprevious work on Nb. In agreement with this previous\nwork and as predicted by the present model, we found\n\n\f2\nthat in YBCO the number of vortices increased for inductions above the critical induction linearly with the\ndifference between the applied induction and the critical induction. In a follow-up to the paper of Stan et\nal., Bronson et al.12 presented numerical simulations for\nthe vortex distribution in narrow strips. These simulations showed that for inductions just above the critical\ninduction the vortices are trapped in the centers of the\nstrips. For higher inductions the vortices formed more\ncomplex ordered patterns, first in two parallel rows, then\nfor higher inductions in larger numbers of parallel rows.\nWe performed statistical analysis of the vortex distribution in our measurements and found agreement with this\nmodel.\nII.\n\nTHEORY OF VORTEX TRAPPING IN A\nTHIN FILM STRIP\n\nWhether or not a vortex gets trapped in a strip is determined by the Gibbs free energy. This energy exhibits\na dip in the center of a superconducting strip for applied\ninductions above a certain critical value. This dip gives\nrise to an energy barrier for the escape of the vortex. The\nmodels proposed by Clem7 and Likharev8 differ from the\npresent model only in the minimum height of the energy\nbarrier required to trap vortices.\nA.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of a vortex in a strip\n\nConsider a long, narrow, and thin superconducting\nstrip of width W in an applied magnetic induction Ba .\nThe vortex trapping process occurs sufficiently close\nto the superconducting transition temperature that the\nPearl length \u039b = 2\u03bb2 /d, with \u03bb the London penetration\ndepth and d the film thickness, is larger than W . In\nthis limit there is little shielding of an externally applied\nmagnetic induction Ba . The resultant superconducting\ncurrents in the strip can be calculated using the fluxoid\nquantization condition:13\nI\nZ Z\n~ * dS\n~ + \u03bc0 \u03bb2 J~s * d~s = N \u03a60 .\n(1)\nB\nIn this equation the first integration is over a closed surface S within the superconductor, the second is over a\n~ is the magnetic inducclosed contour surrounding S, B\ntion, J~s is the supercurrent density, and N is an integer. SI units are used throughout this paper. If we take\nthe strip with its long dimension in the y direction, with\nedges at x = 0 and x = W , and an applied induction\nperpendicular to the strip in the z direction, a square\nclosed contour can be drawn with sides at y = \u00b1l/2 and\nx = W/2\u00b1\u2206x. If we assume uniform densities nv and na\nof vortices and antivortices in the film, with n = nv \u2212 na\nbeing the excess density of vortices over antivortices, the\nfirst integral in Eq. (1) becomes 2Ba \u2206xl, the second becomes 2Js l, N = 2nl\u2206x, and the supercurrent induced\n\nin response to the applied induction is:\nJy = \u2212\n\n1\n(Ba \u2212 n\u03a60 ) (x \u2212 W/2) .\n\u03bc0 \u03bb2\n\n(2)\n\nThe assumption of a uniform density of vortices is good\nat high trapping densities, and at zero density, but is incorrect at low densities, as we shall discuss later. Equation (2) differs from the expression given in Ref. 7 by the\nterm \u2212n\u03a60 : As vortices are nucleated in the film, they\nreduce the screening currents induced in the film by the\napplied induction. The equation derived in Ref. 7 for the\nGibbs free energy of an isolated vortex (upper sign) or\nan antivortex (lower sign) at a position x inside the strip\nis then slightly modified as:14,15\n\u0014\n\u0010 \u03c0x \u0011\u0015\n\u03a620\n\u03b1W\nG(x) =\nln\nsin\n2\u03c0\u03bc0 \u039b\n\u03be\nW\n\u03a60 (Ba \u2212 n\u03a60 )\n\u2213\nx (W \u2212 x) .\n(3)\n\u03bc0 \u039b\nThe Gibbs free energy consists of two terms. The first\nterm, which is independent of the applied magnetic induction Ba , is calculated to logarithmic accuracy, as it\nincludes only the kinetic energy of the supercurrents, and\nit is equal to \u03a60 Icirc /2, where Icirc is the supercurrent\ncirculating around the vortex. This term, which has a\ndome shape and decreases monotonically to zero as the\nvortex reaches a distance \u03be/2 from the edges of the strip,\nis also equal to the work that must be done to move the\nvortex from its initial position at x = \u03be/2 or x = W \u2212\u03be/2\nto its final position at x against the Lorentz forces of attraction between the vortex and an infinite set of negative image vortices at \u2212x + 2mW , m = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...\n. Here \u03be is the coherence length, which is assumed to\nobey \u03be \u226a W . We also assume that the vortex core radius is \u03be, such that the constant \u03b1 = 2/\u03c0 as in Ref. 7.\nOther values of \u03b1, such as 1/\u03c0 as in Ref. 15, or 1/4 as in\nRef. 8 correspond to different assumptions regarding the\ncore size. The second term in Eq. (3) is the interaction\nenergy between a vortex (upper sign) [or an antivortex\n(lower sign)] and the screening currents induced by the\nexternal magnetic induction. It is the negative of the\nwork required to bring a vortex (or antivortex) in from\nthe edge against the Lorentz force due to the induced\nsupercurrent given in Eq. (2). The upper sign in Eq. (3)\ncorresponds to the fact that Jay tends to drive vortices\ninto the film, and the lower sign indicates that antivortices are driven out. When Ba is sufficiently large, this\nterm makes a minimum in G(x) in which vortices can be\ntrapped. For wider strips this minimum occurs at lower\nvalues of the induction.\nB.\n\nPrevious models for the critical induction\n\nThere are two existing models which predict the critical induction for vortex trapping when the applied perpendicular magnetic induction is small (Ba \u223c \u03a60 /W 2 ).\n\n\f3\nIn these models the Gibbs free energy from Eq. (3) is\nused in the limit of n \u2192 0. The critical induction model\nby Likharev8 states that in order to trap a vortex in a\nstrip the vortex should be absolutely stable. This happens when the Gibbs free energy in the middle of the\nstrips equals zero and leads to\n2\u03a60\nBL =\nln\n\u03c0W 2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1W\n\u03be\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the constant in Eq. (3).\nAnother model for the critical induction is proposed\nby Clem,7 who considers a metastable condition. In\nthis view vortex trapping will occur when the applied\nmagnetic induction is just large enough to cause a minimum in the Gibbs free energy at the center of the strip,\nd2 G(W/2)/dx2 = 0, leading to\nB0 =\n\nC.\n\n\u03c0\u03a60\n.\n4W 2\n\n(5)\n\nOur model for the critical induction\n\nThe model proposed here is intermediate between the\nmodels presented in Ref. 7 and 8. As the strip is cooled\njust below the superconducting transition temperature\nTc , thermal fluctuations cause the generation of a high\ndensity of vortex-antivortex pairs. Similar to the processes determining the equilibrium densities of electrons\nand holes in semiconductors, the equilibrium densities\nof vortices and antivortices very near Tc are determined\nby a balance between the rate of generation of vortexantivortex pairs, the rate of their recombination, and\nthe rates with which vortices are driven inwards and antivortices are driven outwards by the current Jy . Accordingly, very close to Tc , the densities nv and na of\nvortices and antivortices equilibrate such that their difference n = nv \u2212 na is very nearly equal to Ba /\u03c60 and\nthe current Jy [see Eq. (2)] is practically zero. When\nB0 < Ba < BL , it is energetically unfavorable for vortices and antivortices to be present in the strip, and as\nthe temperature decreases and the energy scales of the\nterms in Eq. (3) increase, the densities of both vortices\nand antivortices decrease. While vortices and antivortices continue to be thermally generated, the antivortices\nare quickly driven out of the strip by the combination\nof the self-energy and field-interaction energy [note the\nlower sign in Eq. (3)]. The antivortex density thus becomes much smaller than the vortex density and becomes\nso small that the recombination rate is negligible. The\nvalue of n \u2248 nv drops below Ba /\u03c60 . Although when\nB0 < Ba < BL it is energetically unfavorable for a vortex to be present in the strip, the vortex's Gibbs free\nenergy has a local minimum at the center of the strip\nand the vortex must overcome the energy barrier before\nit can leave the strip. Since the energy required to form\n\na vortex-antivortex pair is given by the pairing energy:1\nEpair =\n\n\u03a620\n,\n4\u03c0\u03bc0 \u039b\n\n(6)\n\nthe vortex-antivortex pair generation rate is given by a\npre-factor times the Arrhenius factor exp(\u2212Epair /kB T ),\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant. The vortex escape\nrate is given by an attempt frequency times a second\nArrhenius factor exp(\u2212EB /kB T ), where EB is the difference in the Gibbs free energy between the local maximum\nand the minimum in the center of the strip. Since EB\nand Epair have the same temperature dependences (recall\nthat 1/\u039b is proportional to Tc \u2212 T ), the vortex generation rate and its rate of escape will be exactly balanced\nat all temperatures (aside from a logarithmic factor in\nthe ratio of the two pre-factors) when EB and Epair are\nequal. This occurs at a critical magnetic induction BK\nwhich is the solution of the equation\nmax [G(x) \u2212 G(W/2)] = Epair ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhich leads to the condition\n\u001a h \u0010 \u0011i\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n\u03c0x\n2\u03c0Ba W 2\nmax ln sin\n+\n\u2212 x (W \u2212 x)\nW\n\u03a60\n4\n1\n(8)\n= ,\n2\nwhere the maximum value of the left-hand side of the\nequation is taken with respect to x. This equation can\nbe solved numerically, resulting in\nBK = 1.65\n\n\u03a60\n.\nW2\n\n(9)\n\nIt appears to be an interesting numerical coincidence that\nthe solution to this equation gives a pre-factor (1.6525)\nthat is only different from \u03c0 2 /6 by about 0.5%.\nAs the temperature decreases, \u039b decreases and becomes much less than W . This means that once the\nvortices are trapped in the local minimum and are clustered around the middle of the strip, the potential well in\nwhich they sit changes shape. Recall that the calculation\nof both terms in Eq. (3) assume that \u039b is larger than W .\nIt would not even be possible to magnetically image the\nvortices in the vicinity of the freeze-in temperature because the local field produced by each vortex is then so\nspread out. However, as the temperature decreases, the\nnumber of trapped vortices per unit length remains fixed\nand the applied field remains constant. For n >> 1/W 2 ,\nthe distribution of vortices (averaging over the intervortex spacing) takes on a dome-like shape, and vortex-free\nzones appear at the edges of the strip. The z component\nof the local magnetic induction should then be described\nby the equations given in Sec. 2.1 of Ref. 16. The field\ndistribution in a single strip containing a central vortex\ndome in which the current density is zero is closely related to the field distribution of a pair of parallel coplanar\nstrips with a gap between them.17,18\n\n\f4\nBehavior above the critical induction\n\nBa \u2212 n\u03a60 = BK = 1.65\n\n\u03a60\n,\nW2\n\n0.8\n\n/n\n\n0.6\n\neff\n\nBecause in the present model the screening-current\ndensity [Eq.

To obtain the interaction energy of the vortex at (x, 0) with\nall the vortices when the vortex density is very large\n(n \u226a 1/W 2 ), it makes sense to convert the sum over all\ni to an integral, assuming a uniform density n over the\nstrip width. The integral can be evaluated analytically,\nand the result is exactly equal to the term associated\nwith n\u03a60 in Eq. (3). However, when the average vortex\ndensity is small, we can obtain an approximation to the\ninteraction energy of the vortex at (x, 0) with all other\nvortices by again converting the sum to an integral, assuming uniform density of vortices n over the strip width\nbut only for |yi | > 1/2nW . In other words, we exclude\nfrom the integral a rectangular region of height h and\nwidth W around the origin associated with one vortex,\nwhere n = 1/W h. After changing variables of integration, the resulting interaction energy Uint (W/2) at the\ncenter of the strip can be expressed as\nUint (W/2) =\n\n0.0\n\n(11)\n\nHowever, for Ba just above BK , where n \u226a BK /\u03a60 ,\nwe need to take into account the interactions between\nvortices more carefully.

The\nsample was structured into strips varying from 2-50 \u03bcm\nin width by Ar ion etching. The SSM, in which the sample was cooled, was placed in a liquid helium bath cryostat with three layers of \u03bc-metal shielding. The SQUID\nused in the SSM had a pickup loop which was defined\nby focused ion beam milling and had an effective area of\n10-15 \u03bcm2 during imaging. A magnetic induction perpendicular to the sample was produced by a solenoid coil\nwhich was placed around the sample and SQUID. After\nthe desired magnetic induction was applied the sample\nwas cooled to 4.2 K and the sample was scanned. Many\ndifferent field values have been applied to the sample during cooling to determine the critical induction for the\nvarious strip widths. The sample was warmed up to well\nabove Tc between different cooling cycles.\n\n\f5\n\na)\n\nb)\n-3\n\n10\n\nB\n\n0\n\nB\n\n(\n\n= 2/ )\n\nB\n\n(\n\n= 1/4)\n\nL\n\nL\n\n-4\n\nB\n\n10\n\nK\n\nB\n\nB [T]\n\nc+\n\nB\n\nc-\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nc)\n\nd)\n-6\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nW [m]\n\nFIG. 2: Scanning SQUID microscope images of 35\u03bcm wide\nYBCO strips cooled in magnetic inductions of a) 5 \u03bcT, b) 10\n\u03bcT, c) 20 \u03bcT, and d) 50 \u03bcT.\n\nIn Fig. 2 SSM images are displayed of 35 \u03bcm wide\nstrips for several inductions from 5 to 50 \u03bcT. The strips in\nthese images are darker than their surroundings because\nof a change in the inductance of the SQUID sensor as it\npassed over the superconducting strip. The bright dots\nare trapped vortices. As the inductions increased the\nvortex density also increased until it became difficult to\ndistinguish one vortex from the other (Fig. 2d). In Fig.\n2a and Fig. 2b it is clear that at low trapped vortex\ndensities the vortices tended to form one single row in\nthe center of the strip where the energy is lowest. In Fig.\n2c two parallel lines have been formed, but with some\ndisorder.\n\nA.\n\nCritical induction vs. strip width\n\nThe results of the measurements of the critical induction vs. strip width are displayed in Fig. 3 together with\nthe various models. The measurements were performed\non strips varying from 6-35 \u03bcm in width. Measurements\non strips narrower than 6 \u03bcm were unreliable because the\ncritical induction was high enough to degrade the SQUID\noperation. The critical induction for 40 and 50 \u03bcm wide\nstrips was smaller than the uncertainty in the applied\ninduction.\nThere are two data points in Fig. 3 for each strip width:\nThe upper point indicates the lowest induction at which\nvortices were observed trapped in the strip, and the lower\npoint indicates the highest induction at which vortices\n\nFIG. 3: Critical inductions for vortex trapping as a function\nof strip width. The squares represent Bc+ , the lowest inductions in which trapped vortices were observed, and the dots\nare Bc\u2212 , the highest inductions in which trapped vortices were\nnot observed. The dashed-dotted line is the metastable critical induction B0 [Eq. (5)], the short-dashed and long-dashed\nlines are BL [Eq.

(9)].\n\nwere not observed. This provides an upper and lower\nbound for the actual critical induction. It was apparent\nfrom this log-log plot that the critical induction depended\non strip width as a power law. The best chi-square fit of\nthe experimental data to the two parameter power law\nBc = a\u03a60 /W p yielded a = 1.96 + 0.13 \u2212 0.15 and p =\n1.98 \u00b1 0.03, taking a doubling of the best-fit chi-square\nas the uncertainty criterion. If we set the exponent to\nbe p = 2 (Bc = a\u03a60 /W 2 ), a one parameter fit yielded\na = 1.55 \u00b1 0.27. This is to be compared with a = 1.65\nfor the present model [Eq. (9)], plotted as BK in Fig.\n3. It should be emphasized that there were no fitting\nparameters in plotting BK .\nComparison of the experiment with the models of Eqs.\n(5) and (9) is straightforward, since they are only dependent on the strip width. In order to evaluate Eq. (4)\none must make an estimate of the temperature at which\nvortex freezout occurs because of the temperature dependence of \u03be. The depinning temperature T /Tc = 0.98 used\nin Fig. 3 for both BL curves was calculated by Maurer et\nal.20 for YBCO. In addition we used \u03beY BCO (0) = 3 nm,\na critical temperature of Tc = 93 K, and the two-fluid\nexpression for the temperature dependence of the coherence length, resulting in \u03be(Tdp ) = 10.39 nm. To the best\nof our knowledge the depinning temperature of YBCO\nhas never been determined experimentally. Analysis of\nEq. 4 shows that a Tdp closer to Tc could give better\nagreement between theory and experiment for some strip\nwidths. However the difference in slopes between theory\n\n\f6\nand experiment becomes larger for higher Tdp , making it\nappear unlikely that this is the correct model for our results. The dependence of the Likharev model predictions\non Tdp is displayed in Fig. 4 for \u03b1 = 2/\u03c0.

However, as the\nvortex density increases, the vortex-vortex repulsive interaction makes it energetically more favorable to form\nan Abrikosov-like triangular pattern. Simulations on the\ntrapped vortex position in strips was described by Bronson et al.12 In particular they predict that there should be\na single line of vortices for inductions Bc < Ba < 2.48Bc.\nAbove this induction range a second line of vortices is\npredicted to form. As the induction is increased further\nadditional lines of vortices are predicted to form into a\nnearly triangular lattice.\nWe have investigated the distribution of vortices\ntrapped in our strips at various inductions. As can be\nseen from the images of Fig. 2, even though there was significant disorder in the vortex trapping positions, there\n\nFIG. 8: (a-c) Histograms of the longitudinal spacing between\nvortices trapped in a 35 \u03bcm wide YBCO strip for selected\ninductions. (d) Plot of the standard deviation of the distribution of longitudinal spacings, divided by the mean of this\ndistribution, as a function of induction. The relative widths of\nthe distributions became narrower as the induction increases,\nindicative of ordering in a single row, until at a critical induction of about 10 \u03bcT there was an abrupt increase in the\nrelative width as two rows started to form.\n\nwas also some apparent correlation between the vortex\npositions. An example can be seen in Fig. 7, where a\nhistogram is displayed of the lateral positions of vortices\ntrapped in the 35 \u03bcm wide strip for several inductions.\nAt low inductions, the vortex lateral position distribution\npeaked near the center of the film because the vortices\nwere aligned nearly in a single row. At a second critical\ninduction of Bc2 = 11 \u00b1 1\u03bcT the distribution started to\nbecome broader. At 18 \u03bcT there were two clear peaks in\nthe distribution, corresponding to two rows. Using the\nvalue of Bc = 3.8 \u00b1 1.3\u03bcT for the critical induction of\nthe 35 \u03bcm wide strips from our linear fit of the vortex\ndensity vs. applied induction curve of Fig. 6, we found\nBc2 = (2.89 + 1.91 \u2212 0.93)Bc . This is consistent with\nthe prediction of Bc2 = 2.48Bc of Bronson et al.12 In\nthe same paper the critical induction for the transition\nfrom the two-row to the three-row regime is given to be\nBc3 = 4.94Bc. This gives Bc3 = 18.77 \u00b1 6.42\u03bcT using\nthe same value for Bc . In our measurements we saw no\nevidence for a three row regime. It was not possible to\nperform analysis at higher fields than reported here because of limitations to the spatial resolution of the SSM.\nWe also saw evidence for longitudinal ordering. In\nFig. 8a-c histograms are displayed of the longitudinal distances \u2206y between vortices in the 35 \u03bcm wide strip for\nvarious inductions. As expected the inter-vortex spacing distributions became narrower as the inductions increased, since the vortex mean spacings decreased. How-\n\n\f8\never the distributions became narrow faster than their\nmeans as the induction was increased, indicative of longitudinal ordering, until the second critical induction Bc2\nof approximately 10 \u03bcT was reached. At that induction\nthe relative distribution width \u03b4(\u2206y)/<\u2206y> has a discontinuous jump as a second row starts to form. A similar\ndecrease in the relative longitudinal distribution width\nwith increasing induction is observed in the 6 \u03bcm wide\nstrip, although the spatial resolution of the SSM was not\nsufficient to resolve vortices at the second critical induction for this width.\nIn theory there should be longitudinal ordering independent of the magnetic induction. After all, the Gibbs\nfree energy is independent of the position along the strip\nand the only interaction that plays a role is the interaction between the vortices. Differences in longitudinal\nordering as a function of the magnetic induction could\narise from local minima of the Gibbs free energy caused\nfor example by defects in the material. For relatively low\ninductions vortices can easily be trapped in defects since\nthe interaction between the vortices is small because the\nseparation between the vortices is large. For higher magnetic inductions the number of vortices and likewise the\ninteraction between the vortices increases. This could\nmean that the vortices are more likely to trap at positions\ndetermined by the minimization of the vortex-vortex energy than at positions determined by local defects.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nExperiments on vortex trapping in narrow YBCO\nstrips using a scanning SQUID microscope, as well as pre-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nM.

Ketchen, C. Tsuei, J. Sun, W. Gallagher,\n\nvious measurements on Nb,10 showed a critical induction\nfor the onset of trapping and a dependence of the vortex\ndensity on the induction which were in good agreement\nwith a new model which takes into account the energy required to generate a vortex-antivortex pair. In addition,\nat low inductions the vortices formed a single row, with\nlongitudinal ordering as the inductions increased. Formation of a second row was observed at a second critical\ninduction consistent with numerical modeling.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was financed by the Dutch MicroNED\nprogram and a VIDI grant (H.H) from the Dutch NWO\nFoundation.
