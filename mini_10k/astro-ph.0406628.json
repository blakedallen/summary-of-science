This is the first attempt to observe a sample\nof head-tail sources at low frequencies. We find weak spectral steepening as we\ngo away from the head along the jet. The Crosspiece has a spectral index of\n0.7 (S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ) and is flatter than the spectral index estimated by Lane et al.\n(2002). We also see a low surface brightness, diffuse feature at 240 MHz and\ncould be a possible radio relic candidate (see Figure).\nKeywords : galaxies: individual: 3C 129, jets, radio continuum\n\n'Head-tail' or tadpole shaped radio sources discovered by Ryle & Windram (1969,\nMNRAS, 138, 1) mostly occur in clusters of galaxies and are characterised by a head\nidentified with the optical galaxy and two trails sweeping back from the head (Miley\net al. 1972, Nature, 237, 269).\nThe VLA map of the strong, prototype head-tail source 3C 129 at 325 MHz shows\na small perpendicular object, referred to as the Crosspiece, near the head of the galaxy.\nThis feature has a steep spectrum and has been interpreted by Lane et al. (2002, AJ,\n123, 2985) as a pre-existing fossil radio source that is revived due to 3C 129 ploughing\nthrough it. The relic source is compressed by the bow shock of 3C 129 causing it to radiate\nbehind the shock front, producing the characteristic shape. If the above interpretation\nis correct, structures like the Crosspiece should be rare. This can be verified by making\nhigh resolution low frequency maps of a well defined sample of head-tail sources.
