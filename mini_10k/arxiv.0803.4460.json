In Refs.\n[2, 3, 4] the f0 (1710) scalar meson is suggested as a possible glueball. In [3] it is argued that chiral symmetry\nhas as a consequence that the glueball decays predominantly to ss\u0304 and the ratio of decay amplitudes G \u2192 s\u0304s\n \u0304 is of the order of ms /2m\u0302 \u2243 m2 /m2 ,\nto G \u2192 \u016bd + dd\n\u03c0\nK\nwith mK and m\u03c0 the kaon and pion masses; while in [4]\nG \u2192 q\u0304q q\u0304q is claimed to be the dominant mechanism\nto reproduce the BES observed \u03c0\u03c0/K\u0304K ratio \u223c 0.41 for\nf0 (1710) [5]. In a recent work, using multiple mesonmeson channels to build up the scalar resonances [6],\nit is found that the f0 (1710) scalar meson couples very\nstrongly to s\u0304s and then it is suggested that it could be\nindeed a glueball. Yet, one of the tests which is supposed\nto be very relevant to find out the nature of the meson\nresonances is their radiative decay [7, 8]. Indeed, in [7]\na thorough investigation of the radiative decay of the\nf0 (1710) into \u03c1\u03b3 and \u03c6\u03b3 is done and large decay widths\nare obtained depending on the amount of mixing with\nother non glueball components, as suggested in [9, 10].\nThe importance of the radiative decay to investigate\nthe nature of resonances has also been pointed out in\n[11, 12, 13] in connection with the scalar f0 (980) and\na0 (980) resonances, which in chiral unitary theories appear as dynamically generated [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].\nWith the assumption that the f0 (980) and a0 (980)\nresonances are dynamically generated, hence basically\nmolecules of the \u03c0\u03c0 and K K\u0304 coupled channels, the radiative decay of these resonances is done by photon emission\nfrom the meson components, which technically appear as\nloop contributions. In [11] the important contribution of\nthe K K\u0304 loops to the radiative decay of those scalar resonances into \u03c10 \u03b3 and \u03c9\u03b3 was evaluated. In [12] additional\npion loops were considered and in [13] the contribution of\n\nintermediate vector meson channels was also taken into\naccount, which in the case of the a0 (980) radiative decay\nturned out to be important.\nGiven the fact that the loops gave sizable contributions\nto the radiative decay widths of the f0 (980) and a0 (980)\nresonances, it looks important that a determination of\ntheir strength for higher mass scalar mesons is carried\nout. This is the purpose of the present paper where we\ndetermine for the case of the f0 (1710) the contribution\nof the loops which were evaluated in [13] for the case of\nthe f0 (980) and a0 (980) resonances. Unlike the case of\nthe f0 (980) and a0 (980) resonances, where the couplings\nof the resonances to the different channels is provided by\nthe chiral unitary theories, in the present case we have\nto resort to phenomenology. The rest of the information\nneeded for the evaluation follows closely the steps of [13].\nThe choice of the f0 (1710) resonance to make this study\nis also motivated because its experimental study is feasible at BESIII in near future and plans to do it are under\nway with partial wave analysis tools ready [20].\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nAccording to the Particle Data Group (PDG) [21], the\nf0 (1710) scalar resonance decays mostly into two pseudoscalar mesons, and among the pseudoscalar mesons the\nK K\u0304 channel is the dominant one. From the experimental value \u0393K K\u0304 /\u0393total = 0.38+0.09\n\u22120.19 [21, 22] and from the\nexpression of the decay of the f0 (1710) into K K\u0304,\n\u0393K K\u0304 =\n\n\u03b2\n|g |2 ,\n16\u03c0Mf K K\u0304\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nMf is the mass of the f0 (1710) and \u03b2 =\np\n1 \u2212 4m2K /s, the coupling of the f0 (1710) to the K K\u0304\nisospin I = 0 state results gK K\u0304 \u2243 2350 \u00b1 500 MeV. It\nis worth noting that this value compares very well with\nthat obtained with the coupled channel analysis of [6, 23],\ngK K\u0304 \u2243 2862 \u00b1 440 MeV.\n\n\f2\nThe idea to follow in order to evaluate the radiative\ndecay width is similar to the procedure used in ref. [24]\nwhich we summarize here adapted to the present case.\nOnce we have the value of the coupling of the f0 (1710)\nto the K K\u0304, the philosophy is to consider the transition\nfrom the f0 (1710) mesons to the K K\u0304 states at one loop\nand then attach the photon to the possible allowed lines,\nconsidering that a vector meson in the final state has to\nbe produced. By using arguments of gauge invariance, it\ncan be shown that we only need to evaluate the diagrams\ndepicted in fig. 1, despite the fact that other diagrams are\nin principle needed like, e.g., those with a photon emitted\nfrom the initial and final vertices.\nThe channels we will consider are f0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c10 \u03b3,\nf0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 and f0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3. In fig. 1 P1 , P2 ,\nrepresent the kaons in the loop and V1 , V2 , vector mesons.\nIn tables I and II we show the different allowed\nP1 P2 V1 V2 particles of the diagrams in fig. 1, together\nwith the corresponding coefficients for each channel to\nbe explained latter on. In fig. 1, P , q, k and Q represent\nthe momentum of the different lines that will be used in\nthe evaluation of the loop function.\nNext we show how gauge invariance is invoked in order\nto simplify the calculations. We follow a similar procedure as done in refs. [25, 26] in the evaluation of the radiative \u03c6 decay, in refs. [27, 28] for the radiative axial-vector\nmeson decays and in ref. [13] for the radiative decays of\nthe f0 (980) and a0 (980) scalar mesons.\nWe can write the general expression of the amplitude\nfor the radiative decay of the f0 (1710) meson into a vector\nmeson and a photon (f0 (1710) \u2192 V \u03b3) as\nT = \u01ebV \u03bc \u01eb\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2)\n\nwith\nT \u03bc\u03bd = a g \u03bc\u03bd + b Q\u03bc Q\u03bd + c Q\u03bc k \u03bd + d k \u03bc Q\u03bd + e k \u03bc k \u03bd (3)\nwhere Q is the final vector meson momentum and k the\nphoton momentum. In Eq. (2), \u01ebV and \u01eb are the vector\nmeson and photon polarization vectors respectively. Due\nto the Lorenz condition, \u01ebV \u03bc Q\u03bc = 0, \u01eb\u03bd k \u03bd = 0, the a\nand d terms are the only ones in Eq. (3) which do not\nvanish. On the other hand, gauge invariance implies that\nT \u03bc\u03bd k\u03bd = 0, from where one gets\na = \u2212d Q * k.\n\n(4)\n\nTherefore the amplitude gets the general form\nT = \u2212d(Q.k g\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u2212 k Q )\u01ebV \u03bc \u01eb\u03bd .\n\nIn ref. [13] it was shown that the d coefficients are\nfinite for the type-a diagrams of fig. 1. By doing the\nsame calculation as in ref. [13] (see that reference for\nthe explicit expressions of the Lagrangians needed) the\nd\u2212coefficient for the type-a diagrams is given by the finite\nexpression:\n\u221a MV GV 1 Z 1 Z x (1 \u2212 x)y\ndx\ndy\nda = AC Q1 gK K\u0304 2e\nf 2 8\u03c0 2 0\ns + i\u03b5\n0\n(6)\nwhere s = Q2 x(1 \u2212 x) + 2Q * k(1 \u2212 x)y + (m22 \u2212 m21 )x \u2212 m22\nand A are coefficients given in table I needed to relate\nthe f0 (1710)P1 P2 coupling in charge basis with those in\nisospin basis, gK K\u0304 . In Eq. (6), f is the pion decay constant for which we take the same value as in ref. [13], Q1\nis the sign of the charge of the P1 pseudoscalar meson,\ne is taken positive, GV is the V P P coupling constant\ndefined in [29] and for which we use the numerical value\nGV = 55 \u00b1 5 MeV from ref. [30], m1 (m2 ) is the mass\nof the P1 (P2 ) pseudoscalar meson, MV the mass of the\nfinal vector meson and C are coefficients coming from\nthe vector-pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar (V P P ) Lagrangian\nof ref. [13] after performing the trace of the matrix and\nwhich depend on the particular P1 , P2 and V particles\n(specifically, C is the coefficient of hV \u03bc [\u2202\u03bc P, P ]i of the\nV P P Lagrangian defined as C(P1 \u2202P2 \u2212 P2 \u2202P1 )). The\ndifferent A, C, coefficients are given in table I.\nIn ref. [13] it was shown that the type-b loops of fig. 1\nplayed a relevant role in the radiative decays into V \u03b3\nof the f0 (980) and a0 (980) scalar resonances. Thus we\nalso evaluate the contribution of this kind of loop. The\nLagrangians used for the vertices containing fields other\nthan the f0 (1710) are the same as in ref. [13]. In that\nreference it was also shown that, despite the type-b loop\nbeing apparently quadratically divergent, it could be reduced to a logarithmic divergence which can be easily\nidentified and regularized by expressing it in terms of\nthe two pseudoscalar mesons loop function. Actually the\nexpression of the d-coefficient for the type-b mechanisms\ncan be split into a convergent part,\nNB NC G\u20322 FV\n1\ndcon\n= \u2212ABC gK K\u0304\ne\u03bbV1\nb\n2M1\n32\u03c0 2\nZ 1 Z x\n1\n\u00d7\ndx\ndy \u2032\n(Q2 (1 \u2212 x)2 \u2212 M22 ) (7)\ns + i\u03b5\n0\n0\nand a divergent one,\n\n(5)\n\nThis implies that we only need to evaluate those diagrams contributing to the d-term, which are those having a final structure k \u03bc Q\u03bd . The advantage to evaluate\nonly the d coefficient is that only the loop diagrams of\nfig. 1 contribute since other diagrams, like those involving photon couplings to the vertices which are necessary\nto fulfill gauge invariance, do not give contribution to the\nd coefficient [13, 25, 26, 27].\n\nNB NC G\u20322 FV\ne\u03bbV1 G(P 2 , m1 , m2 ),\n4M1\n(8)\nwritten in terms of the two pseudoscalar mesons loop\nfunction, G(P 2 , m1 , m2 ), which can be properly regularized either with a cutoff [14] or with dimensional regularization [18, 19].

(7) and (8), s\u2032 = Q2 x(1 \u2212 x) + 2Q * k(1 \u2212 x)y +\n(m22 \u2212 M22 )x + (M22 \u2212 m21 )y \u2212 m22 ; M1 (M2 ) is \u221a\nthe mass\nof the V1 (V2 ) vector meson; \u03bbV is 1, 1/3, \u2212 2/3 for\nV = \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 respectively and FV is a coupling constant\nin the normalization of [29] for which we use the value\nFV = 156 \u00b1 5 MeV [30]. The coefficient A has the same\nmeaning as in the type-a loop case and B is the coefficient of the P1 V1 V2 vertex obtained after performing the\nSU (3) trace in hV V P i (see ref. [13]) defined as B P1 V \u03041 V \u03042 .\nAnalogously, C is the coefficient coming from the P2 V2 V\nvertex defined as C P2 V\u0304 V2 from the resulting expression\nafter taking the trace in hV V P i. The NB and NC coefficients are normalization factors for the B and C V V P\nvertices (with coupling G\u2032 ) such that the V \u2192 P \u03b3 decays\nagree with experiment, as explained in ref. [13].\nThe total amplitude for the radiative decay process is\ndiv\ngiven by Eq. (5) where d = da + dcon\nfrom Eqs. (6),\nb + db\n(7) and (8).\nThe radiative decay width of the f0 (1710) resonance\ninto a vector meson and a photon is given, in the narrow\nresonance limit, by\n|~k|\n\u03a3|T |2 \u03b8(Mf \u2212 MV )\n8\u03c0Mf2\n!3\nMV2\n1\u2212 2\n|d|2 \u03b8(Mf \u2212 MV ),\nMf\n\n\u0393(Mf , MV ) =\n=\n\nMf3\n32\u03c0\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the step function.\n\n(9)\n\nThe finite widths of the f0 (1710) resonance and the\nfinal vector meson are taken into account by folding the\nprevious expression with their corresponding mass distributions, in a similar way as explained in refs.[13, 24].\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn table III we show our results for the contributions\nof the type-a and -b loops to the radiative decay widths\nunder consideration. The theoretical errors quoted in our\nfinal results have been obtained by doing a Monte-Carlo\nsampling of the parameters of the model within their\nuncertainties. It is worth stressing that our results must\nbe viewed only as qualitative since we are not considering\nloops coming from decay channels of the f0 (1710) other\nthan K K\u0304.\nFrom the results in table III we can see that the contribution of the loops considered in the present work to the\ndifferent f0 (1710) radiative decays under consideration is\nvery relevant, specially for the \u03c10 \u03b3 decay channel. The\nreason why for the \u03c10 \u03b3 channel the type-b loops is much\nlarger than for the \u03c9\u03b3 and \u03c6\u03b3 is that for the \u03c10 \u03b3 channel the interference of the loop containing charged kaons\nwith those containing neutral kaons is constructive (see\ntable II) for the mechanisms with a \u03c1 meson attached to\nthe photon (the dominant one). On the contrary, for the\n\u03c9\u03b3 and \u03c6\u03b3 decay channels this interference is destructive.\nIn table IV we compare our result with other theoretical determinations using quark models [7, 8].

[7, 8]. Our results are of the same order of\nmagnitude than most of the results of the quark models.\nThis means that the meson loops play very important\nrole in this decays and cannot be neglected in realistic\ncalculations.\nSince we see that at least in the case of decay to \u03c1\u03b3\nthe role of the vector mesons in the loop is relevant, this\n\nraises the question of possible contributions of higher\nmass channels. This is an issue that will have to be faced\nin the future. The results of [6], where unfortunately\nno information is provided on the coupling of the\nf0 (1710) to the different channels, should be relevant\nin this respect and the new channels considered there\nin the scattering problem might provide also a sizable\ncontribution to the radiative decay. Hence, a complete\nevaluation of the role of meson loops in the decay of the\nf0 (1710) resonance is not possible at the present time,\nbut the calculations carried out here, for the likely most\nimportant channel, show clearly that the role of loops\n\n\f5\nloop a loop b\n0\n\nf0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c1 \u03b3\nf0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3\nf0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3\n\n4.3\n4.5\n6.9\n\ntotal\n\n75.5 100 \u00b1 40\n2.34 3.3 \u00b1 1.2\n2.9\n15 \u00b1 5\n\nTABLE III: Contribution of the different meson loops to the radiative decay widths.

Given the dominance of the K K\u0304 channel\nin the decay of this resonance, we have evaluated the\nloops stemming from this decay which contain either\nthree pseudoscalar mesons (type-a in fig. 1) or two pseudoscalars and one vector meson (type-b), in analogy to\nwhat was used in previous works regarding the radiative\ndecay of the f0 (980) and a0 (980) resonances.\nBy using arguments of gauge invariance, it can be\nshown that only type-a and -b loops need to be evaluated and that type-a is convergent while the logarithmic\ndivergence of the type-b loop can be written in terms of\nthe well known two pseudoscalar mesons loop function.\nThe contribution of these meson loops to the radiative decay width is very relevant and should be taken\n\n[1] SESAM\nCollaboration,\nG.\nBali\net\nal.,\nNucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 63, 209 (1997); IBM Collaboration, J.

With no intention to make a precise evaluation of the role of meson loops, lacking information from the coupling of the\nf0 (1710) resonance to higher mass meson-meson channels, the present work has the value of showing the order\nof magnitude of what should be expected, which is sufficient to claim that their consideration is important for a\nproper understanding of the radiative decay widths. Experimental measurements of these radiative decays would\nbe mostly welcome to deepen into the understanding of\nthis controversial scalar resonance and could be accessible at experimental facilities like BESIII.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank financial support from MEC (Spain) grants\nNo. FPA2004-03470, FIS2006-03438, FPA2007-62777,\nFundaci\u00f3n S\u00e9neca grant No. 02975/PI/05, and the\nJapan(JSPS)-Spain collaboration agreement.
