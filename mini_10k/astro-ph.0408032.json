The\ncentral question regarding this important class of sources is whether they represent an\nextension in the luminosity function of binary X-ray sources containing neutron stars\nand stellar-mass black holes (BHs), or a new class of objects, e.g., systems containing intermediate-mass black holes (100 \u2013 1000 M\u2299 ). We have carried out a theoretical\nstudy to test whether a large fraction of the ULXs, especially those in galaxies with\nrecent star formation activity, can be explained with binary systems containing stellarmass black holes. To this end, we have applied a unique set of binary evolution models\nfor black-hole X-ray binaries, coupled to a binary population synthesis code, to model\nthe ULXs observed in external galaxies. We find that for donor stars with initial masses\n> 10 M\u2299 the mass transfer driven by the normal nuclear evolution of the donor star\n\u223c\nis sufficient to potentially power most ULXs. This is the case during core hydrogen\nburning and, to an even more pronounced degree, while the donor star ascends the\ngiant branch, though the latter phases lasts only \u223c5% of the main sequence phase. We\nshow that with only a modest violation of the Eddington limit, e.g., a factor of \u223c10,\nboth the numbers and properties of the majority of the ULXs can be reproduced. One\nof our conclusions is that if stellar-mass black-hole binaries account for a significant\nfraction of ULXs in star-forming galaxies, then the rate of formation of such systems\nis \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 yr\u22121 normalized to a core-collapse supernova rate of 0.01 yr\u22121 .\nKey words: accretion, accretion disks - black hole physics - stars: binaries: general\n- stars: neutron - X-rays: binaries\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM mission have\nbeen used to study entire populations of accretion powered binary X-ray sources in external galaxies. At distances\nexceeding \u223c10 Mpc, the sources that can be studied are\nlimited to the luminous end of the distribution function,\n37\n\u22121\ne.g., Lx >\n\u223c 10 ergs s . The observed sources with Lx up\n38\nto a few \u00d7 10 ergs s\u22121 are very likely closely related to\nthe high- and low-mass X-ray binaries that have been well\nstudied for the past four decades in our own Galaxy and\nits neighbors. However, the discovery of ultraluminous Xray sources (ULXs) with Einstein (Fabbiano 1989), ROSAT\n(Colbert & Ptak 2002; Roberts & Warwick 2000), and ASCA\n(Makashima et al. 2000) has been greatly extended by Chandra and XMM with their far superior sensitivity (see, e.g.,\nreviews by Fabbiano & White 2004; Colbert & Miller 2004).\n39\nThese sources are typically defined to have Lx >\n\u223c 10 ergs\n\ns\u22121 (2 \u2212 10 keV) and have been observed to luminosities as\nhigh as a few \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 . A key question which observations of these sources seek to answer is whether the compact\nobject is (1) a neutron star of mass \u223c 1.4 M\u2299 or black hole of\nup to \u223c 15 M\u2299 (see, e.g., Tanaka & Lewin 1995; Greiner et\nal. 2001; Lee et al. 2002; McClintock & Remillard 2004), or\n(2) a black hole of \"intermediate mass\", e.g., 100 \u2212 1000 M\u2299\n(e.g., Colbert & Mushotzky 1999). This is the question we\naddress on theoretical grounds in the current work.\nULXs appear in different types of galaxies, including ellipticals (Angelini, Loewenstein, & Mushotzky 2001; Jeltema\net al. 2003) where their luminosities are generally confined\n39\n\u22121\nto Lx <\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 ergs s (Irwin, Bregman, & Athey 2004).\nULXs, a few with luminosities as high as \u223c 5\u00d71040 ergs s\u22121 ,\nare especially prevalent in galaxies with starburst activity,\nincluding ones that have likely undergone a recent dynamical encounter (e.g., Fabbiano, Zezas, & Murray 2001; Wolter\n& Trinchieri 2003; Belczynski et al. 2004; Fabbiano & White\n\n\f2\n\nS. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski and E. Pfahl\n\n2004; Colbert & Miller 2004). Two highly photogenic examples are the Antennae and Cartwheel galaxies. The Antennae galaxies (Fabbiano et al. 2001) include 49 very luminous\nX-ray sources, 18 of which are classified as ULXs (Zezas et al.\n2002), and are likely to be by-products of the star formation\ntriggered by the collision of these galaxies (e.g., Hernquist &\nWeil 1993). Approximately half of the ULXs in the Antennae are identified with young star-forming regions while the\nother half have no apparent counterpart (see, e.g., Fabbiano\n& White 2004). The Cartwheel galaxy reveals a substantial\nnumber of resolved as well as some unresolved point sources\nin a ring coinciding with starburst activity and punctuated\nby numerous HII regions (Wolter & Trinchieri 2003, 2004;\nGao et al. 2003). This ring of star formation is apparently\npropagating outward at \u223c 50 km s\u22121 , and the original disturbance was presumably triggered by the penetration of a\nsmaller galaxy some 5 \u00d7 108 years ago. The Chandra sensitivity limit at the distance of the Cartwheel (\u223c 120 Mpc) is\nLx \u2243 5 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 .\nThe ULXs found in these galaxies and numerous others have been suggested to harbor \"intermediate-mass black\nholes\" (IMBHs, e.g., Colbert & Mushotzky 1999). The motivation for this is clear. The Eddington limit for spherically\nsymmetric accretion is given by\nLEdd \u2243 2.5 \u00d7 1038\n\nM\n(1 + X)\u22121\nM\u2299\n\nergs s\u22121\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the accretor, X is the hydrogen mass\nfraction in the accreted material, and Thomson scattering is\ntaken to be the dominant source of opacity. The Eddington\nlimit for neutron stars is only \u223c 2 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 , though a\nfew accretion-powered X-ray sources have typical persistent\nluminosities of \u223c 5 \u2212 8 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 (e.g., Levine et al.\n1991, 1993)-not quite in the ULX range. Intermediate-mass\nblack holes, by contrast, would have Eddington luminosities of \u223c 1040 \u2212 1041 ergs s\u22121 which nicely cover the ULX\nrange. Moreover, the expected spectra from intermediatemass black holes accreting substantially below their Eddington limit (as would be the case for most of the ULXs if they\nwere IMBHs), would have low inner-disk temperatures, as\nis inferred for some of the ULXs (Miller et al. 2003; Miller,\nFabian, & Miller 2004a,b; Cropper et al. 2004). However,\nbefore invoking a new type of hitherto unobserved object, it\nis sensible to ascertain whether stellar-mass black holes of\nmass 5 \u2212 15 M\u2299 could explain many or most of the ULXs.\nThe corresponding Eddington limit for these sources is as\nhigh as \u223c 2 \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 , i.e., extends into the low end of\nthe ULX range. Several Galactic black-hole transient X-ray\nsources have been suspected of exceeding their respective\nEddington limits, but the best case may be GRS 1915+105\nwhere the observed Lx has been above 1039 ergs s\u22121 about\n\u223c30% of the time in daily RXTE ASM averages over the\npast 8 years (A. Levine, private communication). On rare\noccasions, and for brief intervals, Lx for GRS 1915+105 can\nbe high as 7 \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 (2 \u2212 10 keV; e.g., Greiner et\nal. 1996), which is a few times greater than the Eddington\nlimit for the \u223c 14 M\u2299 black hole in this system (Greiner\net al. 2001). If taken at face value, however, sources with\nEddington limited stellar-mass black holes would still fall\nsomewhat short in explaining a significant fraction of the\nobserved ULXs.\n\nA number of ideas have been put forth for ways to circumvent the problem of how \u223c 10 M\u2299 black holes could\nhave apparent Lx values as high as a few \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 .\nKing et al. (2001) suggested that the radiation may be geometrically beamed so that the true value of Lx does not, in\nfact, exceed the Eddington limit. K\u00f6rding, Falcke, & Markoff\n(2002) proposed that the apparently super-Eddington ULXs\nare actually emission from microblazer jets that are relativistically beamed along our line of sight. However, studies of\nthe giant ionization nebulae surrounding a number of the\nULXs (Pakull & Mirioni 2003) seem to confirm the full luminosity inferred from the X-ray measurements. Begelman\n(2002) and Ruszkowski & Begelman (2003) found that in radiation pressure dominated accretion disks super-Eddington\naccretion rates of a factor of \u223c10 can be achieved due to the\nexistence of a photon-bubble instability in magnetically constrained plasmas. They propose that this instability results\nin a large fraction of the disk volume being composed of\ntenuous plasma, while the bulk of the mass is contained\nin high-density regions. The photons then diffuse out of\nthe disk mostly through the tenuous regions, thereby effectively increasing the Eddington limit. This effect is shown to\ngrow as M 1/5 and may yield a super-Eddington factor (hereafter \"Begelman factor\") of \u223c10 in disks around stellar-mass\nblack-hole systems.1\nIn the present work we investigate whether most of the\nULX population-at least in galaxies with current or recent\nstar formation activity-is consistent with black-hole binaries of conventional mass with only mildly super-Eddington\nluminosities. In order to carry out this study we combine a\nunique grid of binary evolution models with a binary population synthesis code to compute theoretical X-ray luminosity functions vs. time after a burst of star forming activity\nhas occurred. We then test how well these calculated results\nmatch the observations. To the extent that our models are\nsuccessful, we can invert the problem and constrain some of\nthe uncertain input physics in binary stellar evolution calculations.\nIn \u00a72 we describe how the incipient black-hole binaries\nare generated. We also present a grid of 52 black-hole binary\nmodels evolved through the phase of mass transfer onto the\nblack hole, i.e., the X-ray phase. In \u00a73 we discuss how we\nutilize the population synthesis tools to generate X-ray luminosity functions for black-hole binaries as a function of\ntime since a discrete star formation event. The results are\npresented as color images of the evolving luminosity function\nvs. time, as well as quantitative line plots of the populations\nvs. X-ray luminosity and vs. time. In \u00a74 we discuss how\nour results apply to ULXs, particularly those that are being\nobserved in increasingly large numbers in external galaxies\nwith Chandra and XMM.\n\n1 We note that there are essentially no empirical guidelines available concerning the spectral characteristics of a stellar-mass black\nhole accreting at such super-Eddington rates. They could quite\nconceivably mimic the spectrum of a more massive black hole\naccreting at sub-Eddington rates.\n\n\fStellar mass black hole binaries as ULXs\n2\n\nBINARY EVOLUTION CALCULATIONS\n\nIn our previous study related to ULXs (Podsiadlowski, Rappaport, & Han 2003; hereafter PRH) we developed two separate components of the calculations necessary for a binary\npopulation synthesis of these objects. In the first, we started\nwith a very large set of massive primordial binaries and generated a much smaller subset of these that evolved to contain\na black hole and relatively unevolved companion star. The\nproduct was a set of \"incipient\" black-hole X-ray binaries\nwith a particular distribution of orbital periods, Porb , donor\nmasses, M2 , and black-hole masses, MBH , for each of a number of different sets of input assumptions (see, e.g., Fig. 2 of\nPRH). For this part of the calculation, we employed various\n\"prescriptions\", based on single star evolution models for the\nprimary, simple orbital dynamics associated with wind mass\nloss and transfer, assumptions about the magnitude of the\nwind mass loss from the primary as well as from the core of\nthe primary after the common envelope, and natal kicks during the core collapse and formation of the black hole. Simple\nenergetic arguments were used to yield the final-to-initial orbital separation during the common-envelope phase wherein\nthe envelope of the primary is ejected. Here we utilized a parameter \u03bb, which is the inverse of the binding energy of the\nprimary envelope at the onset of the common-envelope phase\nin units of GM1 Me /R1 , where M1 , Me and R1 are the total\nmass, envelope mass, and radius of the primary, respectively.\nThis parameter strongly affects the final orbital separation\nafter the common-envelope phase, where smaller values of\n\u03bb correspond to more tightly bound envelopes, and hence\nmore compact post-common-envelope orbits.\nConventional energetic arguments for the ejection of the\ncommon envelope yield the following expression for initial\u2013\nfinal orbital separation:\n\n\u0010a \u0011\nf\n\nai\n\nCE\n\nMc M2\n\u2243\nM1\n\n\u0012\n\n2Me\nM2 +\n\u03b7CE \u03bbrL\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n(e.g., Webbink 1985; Dewi & Tauris 2000; Pfahl, Rappaport, & Podsiadlowksi 2003), where the subscripts \"1\", \"c\",\nand \"e\" stand for the progenitor of the black hole, its core,\nand its envelope, respectively, and \"2\" is for the progenitor\nof the \"donor star\" in the black-hole system. The quantity\nrL is the Roche lobe radius of the black-hole progenitor in\nunits of ai , \u03b7CE is the fraction of the gravitational binding\nenergy between the secondary and the core of the black-hole\nprogenitor that is used to eject the common envelope, and\n\u03bb is defined above. For typically adopted parameter values,\n\u03bb \u223c 0.01 \u2212 1 (e.g., Dewi & Tauris 2000), \u03b7CE \u2243 1, and\nrL \u2243 0.45 \u2212 0.6 (for an assumed mass ratio between the\nblack-hole progenitor and the companion in the range of\n\u223c 2 : 1 \u2192 15 : 1), the second term within the parentheses\nin eq. (2) dominates over the first. In this case, we find the\nfollowing simplified expression for af /ai :\n\n\u0010a \u0011\nf\n\nai\n\nCE\n\n\u2243\n\nrL\n2\n\n\u0010\n\nMc\nM1 Me\n\n\u0011\n\nM2 \u03bb \u2243 0.005\n\n\u0012\n\nM2\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03bb,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the leading factor is rL /2 \u2243 1/4, while the factor in\nparentheses involving the black-hole progenitor is \u223c 0.020 \u00b1\n\u22121\nfor virtually all of the progenitors we consider.\n0.002 M\u2299\nThis explains why the large majority of the incipient black-\n\n3\n\nhole binaries found by PRH resulted from an initially very\nwide orbit (Porb \u223c years-when the primary attains radii\nof \u223c 1000\u22122300 R\u2299 ) preceding the common-envelope phase\nin order to avoid a merger between the secondary and the\ncore of the primary.\nThe final orbital separations (and corresponding orbital\nperiods) after the common envelope depend on the initial\norbital separations according to eq. (3). These, in turn, depend upon a number of issues associated with the evolution\nof massive stars and their wind loss characteristics which\nwere explored in PRH. We expect, however, that the distribution of incipient black-hole binaries in the Porb \u2212 M2\nplane will lie largely within an envelope bounded at the top\nby Porb,t \u221d (ai M2 \u03bb)3/2 (motivated by eq. [3]), and at the\nbottom by values of Porb,b that just barely avoid a merger\nbetween the core of the black-hole progenitor and the companion star. From the results of PRH (see, e.g., their Figs.\n2 & 3) we can fit the following semi-empirical expressions\nto the regions in the Porb \u2212 M2 plane where the incipient\nblack-hole binaries are located:\nPorb,t\n\n\u2243\n\n5\n2\n\nPorb,b\n\n\u2243\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nM2\nM\u2299\n\n\u00133/2\n\n\u03bb3/2\n\n\u0012\n\nM2\nM\u2299\n\n\u00131/4\n\nd\n\nd\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nfor M2 > 1 M\u2299 . The expression for the lower limit on Porb\nresults from the radius-mass relation for stars on the main\nsequence and the functional dependence of the Roche-lobe\nradius on mass ratio. Furthermore, we find empirically that\nthe lower limit on the donor masses in these incipient systems is given by:\nM2,min \u2243\n\n1\nM\u2299 .\n2\u03bb\n\n(6)\n\nThis expression results from the fact that the product of\nM2 \u03bb must exceed a certain value (see eq. [3]) in order to\navoid a merger. A more extensive discussion of the generation of the incipient black-hole X-ray binaries and the relevant references are given in PRH. For other references on\nthis subject see, e.g., King & Kolb (1999); Fryer & Kalogera\n(2001); Portegies Zwart et al. (1997); and Nelemans & van\nden Heuvel (2001).\nFor the second part of the PRH study we calculated a\nsmall but unique grid of 19 black-hole binary models evolving through the X-ray phase, i.e., where the donor star transfers mass to the black hole. These calculations are done with\na full Henyey stellar evolution code so that at least the behavior of the donor star throughout its mass-transfer phase\nshould be quite accurate and realistic. Nonetheless, there are\nstill a number of uncertainties which involve such issues as\nwhether the Eddington limit is strictly adhered to, and when\nthe mass transfer onto the black hole becomes \"transient\"\nin nature; we investigate a number of these issues in this\nwork. In PRH we systematically explored a subset of case\nA binary evolution models where the donor star is initially\nunevolved at the time when mass transfer onto the black\nhole commences. Fourteen of the PRH models were for this\nearly case A binary evolution. A few additional models were\ncomputed for cases where hydrogen had been partially depleted (also case A) or completely exhausted (early case B)\n\n\f4\n\nS. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski and E. Pfahl\nWe reproduce in Fig. 1 plots of the \"potential\" X-ray\nluminosity (Lpot\nx ) for 14 binary evolution sequences with initial donor masses of 2 through 17 M\u2299 from the original\nmodels presented in PRH (for the case of initially unevolved\ndonors). The \"potential\" X-ray luminosity refers to the energy output expected in the absence of the Eddington limit;\ni.e., if the X-ray luminosity2 , Lx , were limited only by the\nmass transfer rate, \u1e40 , and the energy conversion efficiency\nwhich is dictated by the instantaneous spin of the black hole\n(Bardeen 1970). We assumed that each black hole starts with\na mass equal to 10 M\u2299 and with zero spin (i.e., j = 0, where\n0 < j < 1 is the dimensionless spin parameter). We reiterate that in each model shown in Fig. 1, the donor star is\nassumed to start on the main sequence when mass transfer\ncommences. We also note that these binary models include,\nin addition to \u1e40 and Lx , the evolution of Porb , M2 , MBH ,\nand the spin of the accreting black hole.\n\nFigure 1. Potential X-ray luminosities as a function of time for\n14 black-hole X-ray binary evolution sequences; each color corresponds to a different initial donor star mass ranging from 2 to\n17 M\u2299 (adapted from PRH). The trend in the evolutionary sequences from higher to lower overall X-ray luminosity corresponds\nto decreasing initial donor mass. In all cases the donor star is unevolved at the start of mass transfer, and the black-hole mass is\n10M\u2299 . The spiky feature at the end of each evolution corresponds\nto the donor star ascending the giant branch. The duration of this\nlatter phase is \u223c5% of the entire evolution.\n\nFigure 2. Initial donor masses and orbital periods for the 52\nblack-hole binary evolution models.\n\nwhen mass transfer commenced. PRH found that the X-ray\nlifetime in these latter systems is 1 to 2 orders of magnitudes\nshorter than for systems experiencing case A mass transfer\n(see Table 1 of PRH and Figs. 3 and 11). Moreover, for large\ninitial mass ratios, mass transfer would be dynamically unstable. We therefore expect that these more evolved systems\n(cases B and C) will make only a relatively small contribution to the overall population of ULXs.\n\nIn the present work we have significantly augmented our\ngrid of black hole binary evolution models from 19 to 52, and\nin the process consider case A mass transfer in a more systematic way. The additional models follow the same mass\ngrid as the original 19, except that for each mass we now\nallow for three additional evolutionary states of the donor\nstar at the onset of mass transfer. This effectively takes into\naccount a significant portion of the expected orbital period\ndistribution among the incipient systems. The different initial evolutionary states of the donor are characterized by the\nhydrogen mass fraction in the core, Xc . Thus, for each mass,\nthe models are for values of Xc = 0.7, 0.35, 0.2, and 0.1. The\ncorresponding orbital periods at the start of mass transfer\nrange from about 0.6 \u2212 4 days. The location of the starting\npoints for these models in the M2 \u2212 Porb plane are shown in\nFig. 2. To our knowledge, these are the only properly computed evolution models for black-hole binaries during their\nX-ray phase.\nPlots of Lpot\nvs. time since the birth of the incipix\nent binary for a sample of our new evolutionary sequences\nare shown in Fig. 3; these are all for the case where the\ninitial donor mass is 10 M\u2299 , but the initial H fraction\nis different; the black, red, blue, and green curves are for\nXc = 0.7, 0.35, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively. Note that, as\nthe donor star is progressively hydrogen depleted at the\nstart of mass transfer, the duration of the mass transfer\nphase becomes systematically shorter, while the peak values\nof Lpot\nbecome correspondingly higher. The systematically\nx\nlater times of the onset of mass transfer simply reflect the\ntime that the donor star requires to evolve and fill its Roche\nlobe. The duration of the main mass-transfer phase becomes\nshorter, both because the nuclear burning timescale which\nsets the rate of evolution of the star becomes shorter (and\nhence leads to a higher mass-transfer rate) and because the\nremaining core hydrogen-burning lifetime decreases, since\nless H is available. The rest of the 52 evolutionary sequences\nare not shown here in the interest of space, but are used in\n\n2\n\nHere, as throughout the paper, all calculated luminosities refer\nto the total accretion luminosity without regard to the region\nof the X-ray band in which it emerges. Thus, the 2 \u2212 10 keV\nluminosity would likely be somewhat lower than the values cited;\nsee \u00a74 for a discussion of this issue.\n\n\fStellar mass black hole binaries as ULXs\n\n5\n\ncarry out the following variant of a bi-linear interpolation.\nFirst, a weighting factor for each of the four nearest grid\nmodels (in the Porb \u2212 M2 plane) is computed by linearly interpolating in both Porb and M2 . Once this has been done,\nthe logarithms of both the beginning and the end times (ti\nand tf ) of the four evolutions are interpolated using the\nweighting factors; this then provides values of < ti > and\n< tf > to use in the interpolated evolution. Each of the four\nnearest evolutionary models then has its time axis stretched\nand shifted so that it begins and ends at < ti > and < tf >,\nrespectively. For each time between < ti > and < tf > we\nthen do a logarithmic weighting of the quantity of interest\n(e.g., Lx ) for the four nearest models, using the same weighting factors as described above. We have visually inspected a\nsubstantial number of the interpolated evolutions as a check\nthat they behave sensibly.\n\nFigure 3. Potential X-ray luminosities as a function of time for\n5 black-hole X-ray binary evolution sequences; each color corresponds to a different evolutionary state of the donor star when\nmass transfer commences. In all cases the initial masses of the\ndonor and black hole are 10 M\u2299 and 10 M\u2299 , respectively. The\nblack, red, green, and blue curves correspond to the central hydrogen abundance of the donor star at the onset of mass transfer\nof 0.7, 0.35, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively. For comparison, the dotted curve shows the potential X-ray luminosity for a 10 M\u2299 secondary that has already evolved off the main sequence (so-called\nearly case B mass transfer), where mass transfer is driven by the\nexpansion of the secondary as it crosses the Hertzsprung gap on\na thermal timescale. The duration of the mass-transfer phase is\nnot resolved in the figure, as it lasts only \u223c 50, 000 yr.\n\nthe population synthesis study presented in this work, and\nare available in digital form upon request to the authors.\nExperience has shown that population synthesis calculations for systems containing collapsed stars typically re4\nquire >\n\u223c 10 systems in order to achieve results of high statistical quality (see, e.g., Howell, Nelson, & Rappaport 2002).\nSince each of the 52 models we have computed required some\nhalf hour of cpu time-as well as some hand holding-it is\ntherefore impractical at this time to run thousands of blackhole binary models with a Henyey code to describe the population. However, we have found from our models that the\nevolutions in Lx form a nearly self-similar set. That is, if we\ntake any two of the evolutionary models, but especially ones\nthat are close in initial M2 and Porb , then the plots of Lx\nvs. evolution time can be scaled in time and in Lx so they\nare nearly the same (see, e.g., Figs. 1 and 3). This is quite\ndifferent from the case of binary evolution for systems containing neutron stars (see, e.g., Podsiadlowski, Rappaport,\n& Pfahl 2002) where the evolution tracks for initially similar\nsystems can diverge dramatically. Therefore, we have made\nuse of this self-similar behavior to develop an interpolation\nscheme to produce an effectively much larger set of models.\nThus, if we wish to know the evolution of a binary system\nstarting with values of Porb and M2 that are within the grid\nboundaries, but are not located at one of the 52 \"nodes\", we\n\nThe black-hole binaries that we produce may account\nfor a significant fraction of the most luminous X-ray sources\nborn in active star forming regions. However, there are several classes of objects not generated in our population synthesis. Not included are the compact black-hole binaries,\nwith low-mass companions, that are transient sources and\nare observed in abundance in our own Galaxy (see the discussion in PRH). We argue below that these, in fact, may be\na separate population and not what is being observed in star\nformation regions. Moreover, observations of these sources\nin our own Galaxy indicate that they tend to be limited to\n< 1038 ergs s\u22121 , so they may not contribute substantially to\n\u223c\nthe ULX population. We do not consider the evolutionary\nphase before Roche-lobe overflow when the black hole is fed\nby accretion from the stellar wind of the companion. Such\nsystems are likely to be at the low end of the luminosity\nfunctions we generate in this work, e.g., \u223c 1034 (MBH /M\u2299 )2\nergs s\u22121 , where MBH is the mass of the wind-accreting black\nhole. Also, we do not produce systems where the black hole\nis formed in very wide primordial binaries without a common envelope being involved, as in the Voss & Tauris (2003)\nscenario. If objects collapsing to form black holes have natal\nkicks, and if these kicks are appropriately scaled down by\nthe mass of the collapsed star from the case of neutron star\nkicks (e.g., to preserve a constant recoil momentum), then\nthe subsequent orbit could fortuitously remain bound and\nbecome highly eccentric. Eventually, the donor star would\nevolve to fill its Roche lobe and mass transfer would then\ncommence. Such systems will, however, tend to have much\nlonger orbital periods than the ones we generate. This has\ntwo consequences: (1) many of these will result in unstable\nmass transfer if the donor star has a mass exceeding that\nof the black hole; and (2) the mass-transfer phase will be\nextremely short lived. Finally, we are not considering any\nsystems containing neutron stars since these are not likely\nto be able to explain the most luminous ULXs. On the other\nhand, such systems will surely contribute to the luminosity\nfunction up to at least \u223c 5 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 .\n\n\f6\n\nS. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski and E. Pfahl\n\nFigure 4. Simulated evolution of the X-ray luminosity function of black hole binaries with time since an impulsive star formation event.\n\"Luminosity\" refers to the total accretion luminosity without regard to the region of the X-ray band in which it emerges. Thus, the\n2 \u2212 10 keV luminosity would likely be somewhat lower than the values indicated in the plots. Evolution tracks from 105 X-ray sources\nwere computed and then registered in each of the 700 \u00d7 700 pixels that are traversed. The colors crudely represent the logarithm of\nthe relative populations, with purple through red corresponding to ratios of 200 to 1. The mass of the black hole at the start of mass\ntransfer is taken to be 10 M\u2299 . Panel a: Model E. The appropriate Eddington limit of each system has been applied. The upper red\nbar-like feature between log t \u2243 7.2 \u2212 8.2 represents systems with donor stars on the giant branch with higher mass transfer rates; the\nlarger black-hole masses later in the evolution and higher He fraction raise LEdd . Panel b: Model B. All specifications are the same as\nfor panel (a), except that the Eddington limit is allowed to be violated by up to a factor of 10 (see text for details), and each system\nradiates the luminosity that corresponds to the mass transfer rate and the energy conversion efficiency according to the instantaneous\nspin of the black hole (Bardeen 1970). As in panel (a), the red features at the higher Lx values (at log tev >\n\u223c 7.2) are systems with the\ndonor on the giant branch. Panel c: Model S. All specifications are the same as for panel (b), except that the initial mass of the donor\nstar is chosen from a Salpeter initial mass function (Salpeter 1955). This approximates the output from our binary population synthesis\ncode for the case where \u03bb \u2243 0.5. Note that compared to panels (a) & (b) there are many fewer high Lx systems due to the emphasis on\nthe lower-mass donors. Panel d: Model TS. All specifications are the same as for panel (c), except that transient behavior of the X-ray\nsources is approximately taken into account (see text for details). Such systems are assumed to be in an \"on\" state only 3% of the time,\nbut with a value of \u1e40 that is 30 times higher than would be the case if the X-ray emission were steady. Note that most of the systems\n37\n\u22121 no longer appear on the figure, but have been systematically shifted to higher L , producing the yellow ridge\nwith Lx <\nx\n\u223c 10 ergs s\nfor main-sequence donors. The faint red feature at times exceeding 109 yr with high Lx , corresponds to transients with the donor stars\non the giant branch.\n\n\fStellar mass black hole binaries as ULXs\n3\n\nPOPULATION SYNTHESIS\nCALCULATIONS\n\nWe now use the tools described above to generate large\npopulations of black-hole binaries of the type likely to be\nproduced in active star formation regions. The first step is\nto decide which of the outputs to use from the code that\ngenerates the incipient black-hole binaries. Since there are\nmany uncertainties that go into these calculations, we have\ndecided to use somewhat more general distributions of incipient systems in the Porb \u2212 M2 plane that are inspired by\nthe results we found in PRH, rather than taken directly from\nthe specific output for any particular model. We utilize three\ngeneric types of distributions for the incipient black-hole binaries. In the first, we take Porb to be uniformly distributed\nbetween the two curves given by eqs. (1) and (2), and M2 to\nbe uniformly distributed between 2 and 17 M\u2299 . This allows\nfor the broadest contributions from all the binary evolution\nmodels that we have calculated, and would directly imply\na large value of the parameter \u03bb. The second case we consider is one where Porb is distributed uniformly as above,\nbut M2 is distributed in the same way as the stellar initial\nmass function as deduced by, e.g., Salpeter (1955), Miller &\nScalo (1979), and Kroupa, Tout, & Gilmore (1993). This is\na very good approximation to what we find for the high \u03bb\ncase, e.g., \u03bb >\n\u223c 0.5 (PRH). In this case the envelope of the primary is relatively easy to eject and secondaries over a wide\nrange in mass are able to successfully get past this phase.\nTheir mass distribution then also roughly resembles that of\nthe primaries since we utilize a flat mass ratio distribution\n(see PRH). The third case we consider is one where \u03bb has\na small value, e.g., 0.08. In this case only the more massive secondary stars are successful in ejecting the envelope\nof the primary. For the specific value of \u03bb = 0.08 the incipient population of black-hole binaries has secondary masses\nlargely confined to M2 >\n\u223c 6 M\u2299 , and the masses are roughly\nuniformly distributed above this value (see Fig. 2 of PRH).\nThroughout this work we have somewhat arbitrarily\nadopted a fixed black-hole binary production rate of RBH \u2243\n10\u22126 yr\u22121 and cite a representative value of \u03bb \u2243 0.1 in order to normalize all of our luminosity functions. In fact, our\nearlier binary population synthesis study (hereafter \"BPS\";\nPRH) yielded the following values: RBH \u2243 10\u22126 yr\u22121 and\n\u03bb \u2243 0.08 for an incipient black-hole binary population\ncharacterized approximately by donor masses uniformly distributed between 6 and 17 M\u2299 , and RBH \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 yr\u22121\nand \u03bb \u2243 0.5 for the case where the donor masses are approximately distributed according to the Salpeter (1955) distribution over the mass range 2 \u2212 17 M\u2299 . On the other hand,\nno particular BPS model output corresponded closely to our\ncurrent choice of a uniform distribution of donor masses between 2 and 17 M\u2299 , and thus we cannot cite BPS values\nfor RBH and \u03bb for this model. In all of our BPS models\n(PRH) the core-collapse supernova rate was taken to be\nRSN = 10\u22122 yr\u22121 . We comment later in the text on how\nappropriate we think our adopted rate of 10\u22126 yr\u22121 is for\nRBH .\nIn addition to the three different distributions of incipient black hole binaries in the Porb \u2212 M2 plane described\nabove, there are two different assumptions we have made\n\n7\n\nregarding the maximum X-ray luminosities that can be radiated by a black-hole binary. In the first of these, the maximum value of Lx is taken to be just that given by the Eddington limit which, in turn, is governed by the mass of the\nblack hole and the hydrogen/helium composition of the accreted material. In the second, we allow for the possibility\nthat luminosities up to 10 times the nominal value of LEdd\ncan be attained (Begelman 2002; Ruszkowski & Begelman\n2003). Finally, we consider one additional case where the luminosity of the X-ray sources is, under certain physical conditions, transient in its behavior. The transient behavior is\nthought to arise from the well-known thermal-ionization disk\ninstability (Cannizzo, Ghosh, & Wheeler 1982; van Paradijs\n1996; King, Kolb, & Burderi 1996; Dubus, Hameury, & Lasota 2001; Lasota 2001). In particular, if the X radiation\nfrom the central source is not able to maintain a sufficiently\nhigh temperature for the accretion disk (especially for the\nouter portions), the mass transport through the disk would\nbe unstable, and vice versa. In general, this affects mostly\n37\n\u22121\nthe lower luminosity sources with Lx <\n\u223c 10 ergs s . The\nspecific prescription we used to determine whether a particular model at a given time would exhibit transient behavior\nis described in detail in PRH (see also \u00a74). When one of\nour sources is in an evolutionary phase where it would be\na transient we simply allow, in a somewhat ad hoc manner,\nthe mass transfer rate onto the black hole to increase by\na factor of 30 above the long-term average rate of matter\nflowing into the disk, but then give that source a probability weighting of only 1/30 in the population, indicating that\nit would be in an \"on\" state only \u223c3% of the time. More\nempirically correct factors to represent transients might be\nas low as 0.01 for the duty cycle (McClintock & Remillard\n2004; and references therein) and up to 100 times the longterm average mass transfer rate. However, as we shall show,\ntransient systems play a relatively minor role in our models\nof the ULX population, and that would not change even if\nwe had adopted these latter parameters.\nIn summary, the six models that we have chosen to work\nwith are defined as follows:\n\u2022 Model E is defined to have a uniform incipient population\nin the Porb \u2212 M2 plane, and the luminosity during the X-ray\nphase is limited to LEdd ;\n\u2022 Model B is the same, except with a \"Begelman\" luminosity enhancement such that Lx is permitted to be as large as\n10 LEdd ;\n\u2022 Model TB is the same as Model B, but transient source\nbehavior is also included;\n\u2022 Model S is the same as Model B except that M2 is distributed according to a Salpeter (1955) mass function rather\nthan uniformly in mass;\n\u2022 Model TS is the same as Model S, but transient source\nbehavior is also included;\n\u2022 Model 6 is the same as Model B, except that only values\nof M2 > 6 are included.\nFor each of these models we generate a luminosity function vs. time, tev , since an impulsive star formation event.\nWe choose, via Monte Carlo draws, 105 incipient black-hole\nbinaries in the Porb \u2212 M2 plane.

Each\ntime that one of our evolution tracks crosses an element of\nthis array, a value of unity is added to that element. After\nthis operation has been completed for all 105 interpolated\nevolution tracks, the result is displayed as an image representing the unnormalized evolving luminosity function for\neach model. These are shown for Models E, B, S, and TS,\nin Fig. 4.

These result from systems with the initially\nmore massive companion stars. Between \u223c30 and 300 Myr,\nthe peak in the luminosity function falls monotonically from\n\u223c 1039 to < 1037 ergs s\u22121 as systems with the more massive\n\nFigure 6.

Solid curves are for Model B (see Fig. 4\u2013panel a).\nThe two dashed curves are for Model E (i.e., Eddington limited\nX-ray luminosities; see Fig. 4\u2013panel a) at log(tev ) = 7.0 and 7.5;\nthe curves for all later times are nearly indistinguishable from\nthose of Model B. The normalization of the curves is the same as\nin Fig. 5.\n\ndonors run their evolutionary course, leaving longer-lived,\nlower-luminosity systems with initially lower-mass donors.\nNumerous systems with Lx exceeding LEdd for a neutron\nstar are still present after 100 Myr. Note the red group of\nsystems at luminosities above the continuous distribution\nstarting at \u223c 15 Myr and continuing to >\n\u223c 1 Gyr; these result\nfrom the relatively short-lived phase when the donor stars\n(of all initial masses) ascend the giant branch and produce\nmass transfer rates that increase by 1 \u2013 2 orders of magnitude\nover the preceding phase of the binary evolution. Finally,\nnote that the apparent upper cutoff in the luminosity function seems to increase by about a factor of 2 for evolution\ntimes later than \u223c 20 Myr-this results from the general increase in the black-hole mass as they grow by accretion, and\nthe changing chemical composition of the accreted material\nwhich is becoming He enriched.\nThe evolving luminosity function for Model B (Fig. 4,\npanel (b)) is very similar to that of Model E, except for\nthe pronounced increase in the allowed upper limit to Lx ,\n\n\fStellar mass black hole binaries as ULXs\n\n9\n\nFigure 7.

Solid\ncurves represent the number with Lx > 1039 ergs s\u22121 ; dashed\ncurves are for Lx > 3 \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 . The normalization of the\ncurves is the same as in Fig. 5. The peak value for each curve is\nlisted in Table 1.\n\nFigure 8. Total luminosity from black-hole X-ray binaries as\na function of time after an impulsive star formation event. Results for Models E, B, S, TS, and 6 are shown. The distributions\nare normalized to a star formation event that yielded 106 corecollapse SNe. The peak value for each curve is listed in Table 1.\n\nby a factor of 10 \u2013 as defined by the model. This model\nallows for a significant population of sources with Lx up to\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 and a tailing off population to values of\nLx \u2243 2 \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 for times up to 30 Myr after a star\nformation event. We note that the luminosity function for\nModel B (Fig. 4, panel (b)) extends well past the peak in\nthe distribution at all times. Thus, increasing the \"Begelman\nfactor\" by more than a factor of 10 would not substantially\nenhance the population of ULXs.\n\nThe evolving luminosity functions presented as images\nare visually informative and interesting, but a somewhat\nmore quantitative way to view these distributions is as onedimensional plots of either the luminosity functions at specific times or as the evolution with time of the number of\nsources exceeding a given Lx . The first of these is shown in\nFig. 5. Here, the luminosity function is plotted for Model B\nat 6 different epochs after a star formation\nevent; these are\n\u221a\nspaced logarithmically every factor of 10 in time, starting\nat 107 yr. Also shown for comparison as a set of dashed lines\nare luminosity functions for Model E at log(tev ) = 7.0 and\n7.5; the curves for all later times are nearly indistinguishable\nfrom those of Model B. The curves are normalized to 106\ncore-collapse supernovae associated with the star formation\nevent (including those in binary as well as single stars), and\nto a ratio of the black-hole production rate to that for corecollapse SNe, RBH /RSN , equal to 10\u22124 . The most prominent\nappearance of the ULXs, as could be seen qualitatively in the\nluminosity function images, occurs between 10 and 30 Myr.\nThe same luminosity functions, but plotted as cumulative\ndistributions, are shown in Fig. 6. From this plot it is easy\nto see that between 10 and 30 Myr a galaxy, undergoing sufficient star formation to produce 106 SNe impulsively (e.g.,\nwithin <\n\u223c 10 Myr), could be expected to harbor more than\na dozen ULXs containing stellar-mass black holes. Also, we\n39\n> 39.5\nshow in Fig. 7 the number of ULXs ( >\n\u223c 10 and \u223c 10\n\u22121\nergs s ) vs. time since a star formation event for Models\nB, E, S, TS, & 6. These curves have also been normalized to\n106 SNe and to RBH /RSN = 10\u22124 . Finally in this regard, we\nshow in Fig. 8 the integrated X-ray luminosity corresponding to the source numbers given in Fig. 7. Except for Model\nS, typical integrated X-ray luminosities of 4 \u2212 9 \u00d7 1040 ergs\ns\u22121 are attained following a large star formation episode\n(normalized to 106 core-collapse SNe).\n\nIn Fig. 4, panel (c) we present the evolving luminosity\nfunction for Model S, where the initial donor star masses are\ndistributed according to a Salpeter IMF, i.e., with a steeply\ndecreasing population with increasing mass. In such a scenario, the X-ray luminosity function is much less strongly\npeaked at times <\n\u223c 30 Myr, i.e., not dominated by a narrow range of luminosities, than in the previous models. In\nparticular, there are relatively fewer candidate ULX sources.\nThis is a natural consequence of the smaller numbers of massive donor stars. Finally, the evolving luminosity function for\nModel TS is presented in Fig. 4, panel (d). In this model,\nthe Salpeter mass distribution is again applied to the incipient donor stars, but transient source behavior due to\nthe thermal/viscous disk instability is now included (in an\napproximate way). Note that most of the lower luminosity\n37\n\u22121\nsources (i.e., with Lx <\n\u223c 10 ergs s ) are missing from the\nevolving luminosity function. These have been boosted up\nby a factor of 30 in Lx , but are given a weighting in the\n\"image\" of only 1/30. The effect of the transients is most\npronounced for times >\n\u223c 200 Myr where they appear as a\nyellow ridge in the Lx \u2212 tev plane with Lx in the range of\n1038 \u22121039 ergs s\u22121 . Note also the faint red feature appearing\n9\nat times >\n\u223c 10 yr which extends into the ULX luminosity\nrange. These are due to donor stars of initially lower mass\nthat are on the giant branch and exhibit transient behavior\n(GRS 1915+105 in our Galaxy may be an example of such\na system).\n\nThe type of information contained in the 'data' files\nused to produce Fig. 4 can also be used to construct the\n\n\f10\n\nS. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski and E. Pfahl\n\nFigure 9. Luminosity functions for a galaxy undergoing continuous star formation at a fixed age \u226b 108 yr. The core-collapse\nSN rate is taken to be 0.01 yr\u22121 . The results are derived from\nFig. 4 by weighting each column of pixels by the time interval\nrepresented by that pixel, and then summing each row of pixels\nover all columns. Models B, E, S, TS, and 6 are defined in the\ntext.\n\nblack-hole binary X-ray luminosity function for any history\nof star formation. To illustrate this, we compute the luminosity function for a galaxy undergoing continuous, uniform\nstar formation for times exceeding billions of years. To do\nthis we merely sum over the columns of the Lx \u2212 tev matrix, multiplying each column by its width in time (noting\nthat the widths of the columns increase logarithmically with\ntev ). The results are shown in Fig. 9 for an assumed formation rate of black-hole binaries of RBH = 10\u22126 yr\u22121 (PRH),\nwhich in turn utilizes a SN rate of 0.01 yr\u22121 (e.g., Cappellaro, Evans, & Turatto 1999). The results in Fig. 9, for three\nof our models (B,E, and 6), indicate that a typical normal\nspiral galaxy such as our own would have about a half dozen\nULXs at any given time. Models S and TS, with a smaller\npopulation of initially massive stars, produce of order one\nULX, in closer agreement with the observed number in our\nGalaxy.\nWe can also use the results of Fig. 9 to compute the integrated X-ray luminosity in the continuous star formation\nscenario for each of our models. We list the results in Table 1-scaled up by a factor of 10 for better comparison to\ntypical active star forming galaxies with an assumed corecollapse SN rate of 0.1 yr\u22121 . It is instructive to compare our\nresults with the empirical findings of Gilfanov, Grimm, &\nSunyaev (2004) and Ranalli, Comastri, & Seti (2003) who\ncite their findings in terms of the relation between the massive star formation rate (SFR), expressed in units of M\u2299\nyr\u22121 for stars with M > 5 M\u2299 , and the total X-ray luminosity Lx,tot . To intercompare our theoretically derived results\nwith their empirical findings, it is helpful to have a conversion factor between the rate of core-collapse SNe (RSN ) and\nthe SFR, which we estimate to be RSN \u2243 0.025 SF R for\na Salpeter-type IMF. With this conversion we find that our\nadopted value of RSN = 0.1 yr\u22121 corresponds to an SFR of\n\u223c 4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . For this particular value of SFR Gilfanov et\n\nFigure 10. Simulated representation of the luminous black-hole\nX-ray binaries in a galaxy where a star formation wave was triggered by a catastrophic event at the center some 5 \u00d7 108 years\nago. The top and bottom panels were produced for Models B\nand 6, respectively. The wave of star formation is assumed to\npropagate outward at a constant speed. The surface density of\ninterstellar gas used to form the stars is taken to be a constant\nper unit surface area. The X-ray luminosities were chosen via a\nMonte Carlo technique from the distribution for Model B (Fig.\n4\u2013panel b) and Model 6. This spatial distribution of sources is\nreminiscent of Chandra images of the Cartwheel galaxy.\n\nal. (2004) and Ranalli et al. (2003) find an average value of\nLx,tot \u2243 2 \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 . Our tabulated values of Lx,tot\n(Table 1) for continuous star formation are typically an order of magnitude larger than than the empirical value. The\nvalues for Lx,tot in Table 1 for impulsive star formation are\nin better agreement with those of Gilfanov et al. (2004) and\nRanalli et al. (2003), but there our normalization of 106\ncore-collapse SNe, which corresponds to, e.g., RSN = 0.1\nyr\u22121 for a finite time of 107 years, probably underestimates\nthe actual number of SNe contributing to the observed population of luminous X-ray sources. On the other hand, the\n\n\fStellar mass black hole binaries as ULXs\nassumption of a completely continuous star formation scenario likely overestimates the number of luminous systems.\nOn balance, we conclude that the comparison of our results\n(Table 1) to those of Gilfanov et al. (2004) and Ranalli et al.\n(2003) indicates that our adopted formation rate of blackhole binaries of 10\u22126 yr\u22121 for RSN = 0.01 yr\u22121 is likely too\nhigh by a factor of \u223c 3. This probably also indicates that our\nnormalization to an effective value of \u03bb = 0.1 (the bindingenergy parameter of the BH progenitor) is likely a bit too\nlarge; perhaps a better selection would be \u03bb = 0.06 \u2212 0.07.\nFinally, we illustrate how, for external galaxies, our results can be used to relate the spatial offsets between ULXs\nand current star forming regions. For this we use the evolving\nluminosity functions after an impulsive star formation event\n(e.g., Fig. 4). In this exercise we make a crude model for\nthe annular concentration of luminous X-ray sources in the\nCartwheel galaxy. We envision an unperturbed spiral galaxy\nwith a uniform surface column density of interstellar gas as\nthe initial condition. We assume that some 5 \u00d7 108 years ago\na smaller galaxy passed through the center of the spiral and\ntriggered a wave of star formation (Hernquist & Weil 1993)\nwhich has just now reached a radius marked by numerous\nHII regions and luminous X-ray sources. We choose random\nlocations over the surface of the disk (per unit area); the\nradial distance of each location then specifies the time since\nthe star formation wave has passed. The results shown in\nFig. 4, panel (b) are then used as a probability distribution\nto choose an X-ray luminosity. This is repeated until 100 Xray sources have been chosen for the realization. The results\nare shown in the top panel of Fig. 10. The yellow ring marks\nthe outer 10% in radius. Note that while the luminous X-ray\nsources are indeed concentrated in the outer ring, there are\n38\n\u22121\nstill a number of luminous sources ( >\n\u223c 10 ergs s ) well\ninside the ring. We then repeated this exercise for Model\n6 where initially more massive donor stars are emphasized;\nfor this model the sources are even more concentrated in the\nouter 10% of the simulated galaxy (lower panel in Fig. 10).\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have computed a unique grid of 52 black-hole binary evolution models covering donors in the mass range of 2\u221217 M\u2299\nand 4 different evolutionary phases at the onset of mass\ntransfer from the ZAMS to the TAMS. We chose the incipient black-hole binaries from regions of the Porb \u2212 M2 plane\nthat were suggestive of the results of the binary population\nsynthesis study by PRH. Several different assumptions were\nmade in choosing the donor masses in the incipient population of black-hole binaries (i.e., Model sets {E,B,TB}, {6},\nand {S,TS}). For each incipient binary chosen, we utilized an\nevolution track that was interpolated from among the binary\nevolution models in our grid. In this way we computed luminosity functions for large sets of simulated black-hole binaries. The masses of all the black holes in our evolutionary calculations were taken to be initially 10 M\u2299 . In future studies\nthe black-hole mass should be taken directly from the population synthesis calculations, and would then range from\n\u223c 5 \u2212 15 M\u2299 (based on observational constraints; e.g., McClintock & Remillard 2004). The lower black-hole masses,\n\n11\n\nwhen paired with the higher-mass donors (e.g., >\n\u223c 12 M\u2299 ),\nwould lead to dynamically unstable mass transfer and would\nthen not enter the population. The inclusion of lower-mass\nblack holes will have some modest effect, but certainly not a\ndominant one, on the luminosity functions that we calculate\n(see also Fig. 11 and the associated discussion).\nOur luminosity functions are sensitive to two principal input parameters. First, the value of \u03bb (related to the\nbinding energy of the progenitor of the black hole) directly\naffects the mass distribution of donor stars in the black-hole\nbinaries. As discussed in the text, there are significant uncertainties in the appropriate values of \u03bb to use. The smaller\n(larger) the value of \u03bb the more the incipient donor stars are\nweighted toward higher (lower) mass. The contributions to\nthe ULX population come from, in decreasing order of importance, black-hole binaries with: (i) high-mass companions, (ii) mid- to high-mass donors on the giant branch, and\n(iii) lower-mass companions that lead to transient behavior.\nSecond, our results are sensitive to the factor by which we\nallow for super-Eddington luminosities. In most of our calculations we have used a factor of 10 times the usual values\nof LEdd (as estimated by Begelman 2002). This substantially\nhelps in the production of ULXs. However, we find that any\nfurther increase in this enhancement factor does not significantly increase the number of ULXs since the systems then\nbecome limited by the available mass-transfer rates.\nWe find generally encouraging agreement between the\nULX populations that we are able to generate and the\nobservations-at least for the ULX luminosity function below \u223c 2 \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 . Some of our models, in particular\nModel B, yield substantial numbers of ULXs for times up to\n30 Myr after a star formation event, and a few such sources\nfor times up to 100 Myr. We have found, however, by comparing our production rate of ULXs and the concomitant\nvalues of Lx,tot with the empirical relation between the star\nformation rates and Lx,tot derived by Gilfanov et al. (2004)\nand Ranalli et al. (2003) that our adopted black-hole binary formation rate of 10\u22126 yr\u22121 for a core-collapse SNe\nrate of 0.01 yr\u22121 is likely too high by a factor of \u223c 3. Our\ncalculated evolution of the luminosity function after a star\nformation event can explain spatial offsets between the location of ULXs and current-epoch star forming regions (e.g.,\nZezas & Fabbiano 2002; Fabbiano & White 2004, and references therein), provided that the wave of star formation\npassed from the former to the latter. This is a possible alternative explanation to the one which requires that the ULXs\nare given natal kicks and ejected from the star clusters in\nwhich they are born (e.g., Zezas & Fabbiano 2002).\nThroughout this work all of the cited luminosities in the\nfigures and table have been bolometric. On the other hand,\nmost of the literature on ULXs cites Lx in the 2 \u2212 10 keV\nband due to the sensitivity range of X-ray telescopes. It is\ndifficult to estimate what fraction, f , of the bolometric X-ray\nluminosity emerges in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band precisely because\nvery few measurements extend to substantially lower or\nhigher energies. Nothwithstanding this limitation, we have\nused various spectral shapes for ULXs reported in the literature to estimate f . We find values of f between 0.1 and 0.5\nwith a most probable value of \u223c0.3. This range for f should\nhold unless a large fraction of the luminosity is emitted in a\n\n\f12\n\nS. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski and E. Pfahl\n\nlow-temperature multi-component disk spectrum that falls\nlargely outside the 2\u221210 keV range. (For a related discussion\nsee Appendix A2 of Portegies Zwart, Dewi, & Maccarone\n2004.) We can foresee two distinct possibilities for the factor f : (1) it falls within a fairly narrow range (e.g., near\n\u223c0.3) for most ULXs, or (2) it varies from source to source\nor temporally for individual sources. In the first instance,\nthe entire luminosity functions that we generate could be\nshifted downward in luminosity such that, e.g., the peak of\nthe luminosity function for model B drops from \u223c 2 \u00d7 1039\nergs s\u22121 to \u223c 6 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 , and the highest (and rarest)\nluminosity sources of \u223c 2 \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 fall to \u223c 6 \u00d7 1039\nergs s\u22121 . By contrast, in the second case, if f varies from low\nto high values (among sources or temporally) then our luminosity functions might be not be so seriously shifted to lower\nluminosities, but would yield fewer luminous sources overall. This, in turn, would actually help the \"overproduction\"\nproblem discussed in \u00a73. If the net result of smaller values of\nf is to shift our simulated luminosity functions to substantially lower luminosities, then this suggests two possibilities:\n(1) the basic results we have generated are correct, but then\nthe \"Begelman factor\" would have to be as high as \u223c30 instead of 10 for black-hole accretors with masses of \u223c 10 M\u2299 ,\n40\nor (2) the most luminous ULXs with Lx (2 \u2212 10 keV) >\n\u223c 10\n\u22121\nergs s\nindeed represent a different class of objects, e.g.,\nIMBHs. More work is needed both observationally, to determine f empirically with greater certainty, and theoretically,\nespecially regarding the photon bubble instability model to\nascertain if super-Eddington factors of \u223c 30 are possible.\nIn this work we have not included the contributions\nfrom very luminous neutron star binaries (e.g., HMXBs resembling SMC X-1 and LMC X-4). Such systems are likely\nto be very short lived (e.g., \u223c 105 yr; see e.g., Levine et al.\n1991; 1993; 2000) due to the tidal interactions that drive the\nRoche lobe rapidly through the atmosphere of the primary.\nHowever, such neutron star binaries are much easier to form\nthan black-hole binaries, and therefore their contributions\nto the luminosity function between \u223c 1037 and 5 \u00d7 1038 ergs\ns\u22121 should be substantial. In any study attempting to compute the entire luminosity function, the luminous neutron\nstar systems clearly need to be included (e.g., Belczynski et\nal. 2004). The intention of the present study, however, was\nlimited to evaluating the contribution of stellar-mass blackhole binaries to the ULX population.\nOne further caveat is in order with regard to the success of our model for the ULXs. Most of the ULXs that we\ngenerate in our population synthesis have high-mass donors\nand are not transients. By contrast, many of the black-hole\nbinaries discovered and studied in our Galaxy are transients\nwhose time-averaged mass-transfer rate is well below Eddington and whose companions are rather low in mass (i.e.,\n< 1 M\u2299 ) (see, e.g., McClintock & Remillard 2004). This ap\u223c\nparent discrepancy between the two populations was discussed in PRH, and hinges on the fact that it is difficult,\nin the context of the present model, to produce black hole\nbinaries with low initial donor masses. This problem arises\ndue to the fact that a secondary of <\n\u223c 2 M\u2299 tends to merge\nwith the core of the massive black-hole progenitor instead\nof ejecting the common envelope. Also, as demonstrated in\nPRH, black-hole binaries with initial donor masses >\n\u223c 2 M\u2299\n\nFigure 11. Potential X-ray luminosities as a function of time\nsince the beginning of mass transfer (offset by 103 yr for clarity) for 4 black-hole X-ray binary evolution sequences. Each color\ncorresponds to a different mass or evolutionary state of the donor\nstar when mass transfer commences (as indicated). In all cases\nthe initial mass of the black hole is 5 M\u2299 . The black and red\ncurves are for donor stars with initial masses of 6 M\u2299 , while the\ngreen and blue curves are for donor stars with initial masses of\n9 M\u2299 . For the black and green curves the donor star commences\nmass transfer in the middle of the main sequence (case A mass\ntransfer). The red and blue curves correspond to the case where\nthe donor star has evolved off the main sequence and traverses the\nHertzsprung gap at the start of mass transfer (early case B mass\ntransfer). In all four calculations, thermal timescale phases last\nof order 105 yr. Since these involve somewhat lower-mass donor\nstars than the main contributors to our ULX candidates, they\nmay be more common, which can compensate somewhat for the\nshorter duration of the high mass transfer rate episodes.\n\ncan evolve into the type of compact systems often seen in\nthe Galaxy-but only if there is a significant source of systemic orbital angular momentum loss, e.g., magnetic braking, which has been assumed not to operate in stars with\nradiative outer envelopes (Parker 1955; Pylyser & Savonije\n1988). We note, however, that there is a subset of stars with\nradiative envelopes, the Ap/Bp stars, with masses up to\n\u223c 3 M\u2299 that have strong magnetic fields (\u223c 10 kG) and\nlong rotation periods (e.g., Hubrig et al. 2000). While the\norigin of the large magnetic fields in these stars and their relation to the rotation periods are presently not understood,\ntheir very existence may suggest that there could be a subset of stars with radiative envelopes where magnetic braking\nis operative. This is clearly a problem that warrants further\nconsideration and modeling.\nKing et al. (2001) discuss the possible importance of\nthermal timescale mass transfer (see, e.g., PRH) onto black\nholes as the driver of high rates of mass transfer in ULXs. We\nnote, however, that most ULXs in our simulations are binaries where mass transfer is driven by the nuclear evolution of\nthe massive donor, most commonly hydrogen burning in the\n\n\fStellar mass black hole binaries as ULXs\ncore, but in a fraction of systems ( <\n\u223c 5 %) by hydrogen shell\nburning as the donor star ascends the giant branch. Even\nhigher mass-transfer rates can indeed be attained during\nphases where the secondary is out of thermal equilibrium,\neither during thermal timescale mass transfer or when the\nsecondary moves across the Hertzsprung gap (so-called early\ncase B mass transfer). However, since the lifetimes of these\nphases are typically several orders of magnitude shorter than\nthe phases where mass transfer is driven by the nuclear evolution, few ULXs are expected to be found in this phase\n(see the dashed curve in Fig. 3)3 . To illustrate this further\nwe have done some additional binary calculations, shown in\nFig. 11, for secondaries with initial masses of 6 and 9 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively, in two evolutionary phases: in the middle of\nthe main sequence (case A) and just after the secondary\nhas left the main sequence and started to move across the\nHertzsprung gap (early case B). In all calculations, the initial mass of the black hole was taken to be 5 M\u2299 . In the\n6 M\u2299 case A sequence, the secondary always remains in\nthermal equilibrium and mass-transfer is entirely driven by\nthe nuclear evolution of the core. For about \u223c 107 yr its\npotential X-ray luminosity (just) exceeds 1039 ergs s\u22121 and\nmay be classified as a ULX during this phase. In contrast,\nthe 9 M\u2299 case A sequence experiences a phase of rapid,\nthermal timescale transfer, lasting \u223c 2 \u00d7 105 yr. During this\nphase the potential X-ray luminosity reaches a peak exceeding 1041 ergs s\u22121 . After the thermal timescale phase, mass\ntransfer continues but now on a nuclear timescale for the\nnext 3\u00d7107 yr at a rate that is not sufficient to power a ULX.\nBoth case A systems appear as ULXs again as they ascend\nthe giant branch where their evolution is driven by hydrogen\nshell burning. In the case B sequences, where mass transfer is\ndriven by the thermal timescale evolution of the secondary\nacross the Hertzsprung gap, the mass-transfer phases last\nonly \u223c 105 yr, but reach peak mass-transfer rates of 10\u22124\nand 8\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for the 6 and 9 M\u2299 sequences, respectively, and corresponding peak potential X-ray luminosities\nof order and above 1042 ergs s\u22121 . Note that in these latter\nsequences, the mass-transfer rates, and hence potential Xray luminosities, drop by 1.5 orders of magnitude after the\nmass-ratio has been reversed and the orbit starts to expand\nrapidly. During this latter phase, the potential X-ray luminosities remain in the ULX regime, but decrease gradually\n(the moderately sloping portions of the curves in Fig 11).\nThese sequences (Fig. 11) demonstrate that during thermal timescale mass-transfer phases, very high mass-transfer\nrates are attained, providing potentially enough fuel to\npower even the most luminous ULXs, but that the duration of these phases, which obviously scales as the inverse of\nthe characteristic mass transfer rate, is short compared to\nthe duration of phases where mass transfer is driven by the\nnuclear evolution of the secondary. A compensating factor is\nthat lower-mass secondaries can in principle produce masstransfer rates in the ULX regime during thermal timescale\nphases (onto low-mass black holes) that they could not oth3\n\nThis is generally true for mass transfer from a more massive\nstar to a less massive star and, as is well known, explains, e.g.,\nthe paucity of \u03b2 Lyrae systems compared to Algol-type systems,\nbelieved to be their descendants (for a general discussion, see\nPaczy\u0144ksi 1971).\n\n13\n\nerwise do during the nuclear-driven phases. This effect may\nsomewhat, but not drastically increase the relative number\nof thermal timescale systems compared to nuclear timescale\nsystems.\nTransient source behavior, due to the thermalionization disk instability (e.g., van Paradijs 1996; King,\nKolb, & Burderi 1996; Dubus, Hameury, & Lasota 2001)\nhas been invoked as a way of producing higher mass transfer rates, albeit only for concomitantly reduced fractional\ntimes of the total binary mass transfer phase. We have found\nthat when we include transient source behavior, which occurs predominantly in systems with lower average luminosity\n37\n\u22121\n(e.g., <\n\u223c 10 ergs s ), there is essentially no change in the\nluminosity function for times <\n\u223c 100 Myr; thereafter, there\nis a modest enhancement of high-Lx sources due to transient source behavior, but the bulk of these objects have\n38\n\u22121\nluminosities <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 ergs s (see Fig. 4, panel [d]).\n\nThe giant phase of the donor star is also a natural\nmechanism to consider for driving mass transfer rates that\ncould enhance the ULX population. The mass transfer phase\ndriven by the ascent of the donor up the giant branch is dramatically evident in Fig. 1 as \"spikes\" in Lx near the end of\nthe evolution. Indeed the mass transfer rate increases during\nthis phase by 1 \u2013 2 orders of magnitude. However, this phase\nis relatively short lived and tends not to contribute dramatically to the population of ULXs. Fig. 4 shows the integrated\ncontribution of the giant branch phase of mass transfer to\nthe ULX population-these are seen as a red ridge lying\n\u223c1.5 orders of magnitude above the peak in the luminosity\nfunction for times >\n\u223c 15 Myr. One could argue that in galaxies where the Chandra sensitivity limit is \u223c 1039 ergs s\u22121 ,\nthese (giant branch) sources would be the only ones visible at tev >\n\u223c 15 Myr. This is true, but then the issue arises\nas to what absolute numbers of sources are predicted. As\ncan be seen from Fig. 6 the contributions from giant-branch\ndonor sources do show up as a modestly significant feature\n40\n\u22121\nfor Lx >\n\u223c 10 ergs s at \u223c30 Myr.\n\nOur models also have some predictive power concerning\nthe optical appearance of the ULX black-hole binaries. We\nhave computed tracks for our binary evolution models in the\nHR diagram, taking into account both the contribution from\nthe donor star and the accretion disk. Light from the disk,\nin turn, results from reprocessing of X-radiation and from\nviscous heating. We computed the effective temperature of\nthe disk as a function of radius, r, from the following simple\nexpression that we derived:\nT (r) \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\nLx\n2\n4\u03c0rmin\n\u03c3\n\n\u00131/4 h\n\n2 \u2032 \u221212/7\n3\n\u03bex\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + x\u22123\n7\n2\n\ni1/4\n\n, (7)\n\nwhere x is the radial distance in units of rmin , the inner radius of the disk, \u03b1 is the X-ray albedo of the disk (which we\ntake to be \u223c0.7), and \u03be \u2032 is defined by \u03be \u2032 = \u03be(rmin /rmax )2/7 ,\nwhere, in turn, \u03be is the half thickness of the disk, h, at rmax ,\n\u22122/7\nin units of rmax . In this formulation h(r) = \u03ber 9/7 rmax , and\nwe take \u03be = 0.1 as an illustrative value corresponding to a\nfull angular thickness of the disk equal to \u223c 12\u25e6 . For the\ndisk-heating problem only, we have taken the inner edge\nof the accretion disk to be at 6GMBH /c2 regardless of the\nspin of the black hole, and we have neglected the factor\n\n\f14\n\nS. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski and E. Pfahl\nFinally, we briefly discuss the issue of ULXs in elliptical galaxies (e.g., Angelini, Loewenstein, & Mushotzky 2001;\nColbert & Ptak 2002; Jeltema et al. 2003; Ptak & Colbert\n2004). The presence of true ULXs with certified X-ray luminosities exceeding 1039 ergs s\u22121 would be very difficult\nto explain within the context our black hole binary model\n8\nunless the elliptical galaxy had a recent (e.g., <\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 yr)\nmerger and star formation cycle. Recently Irwin, Bregman,\n& Athey (2004) have shown, from a sample of 28 elliptical\nand S0 galaxies observed with Chandra, that the number of\n39\n\u22121\nsources with Lx >\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 ergs s was equal to the number expected from background or foreground objects. Thus,\nthey conclude that, with only the exception of two ULXs\nin globular clusters within NGC 1399, ULXs \"are generally not found within old stellar systems\". Nonetheless, the\n39\n<\nULXs found in early-type galaxies with 1039 <\n\u223c Lx \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\n\u22121\nergs s\nare not naturally explained within the context of\nour model.\n\nFigure 12. Evolution tracks in the HR diagram are shown for 4\nof our models; these are for donors stars that had initial masses\nof 4, 6, 8, and 10 M\u2299 and were on the zero-age main sequence at\nthe start of mass transfer. Each binary system is represented by\ntwo different evolution tracks; the thin curve is the contribution\nfrom the donor star alone, while the thicker curve (of the same\ncolor) describes the track for the total system light \u2013 both disk\nand donor star.\n\n\u0010\n\n1\u2212\n\np\n\nrmin /r\n\n\u0011\n\nfound in the Shakura & Sunyaev (1973)\n\nsolutions. This latter approximation affects only the x\u22123\nterm which, in any case, contributes little to the optical flux\nfrom the disk. The contributions to the B and V bands from\nthe donor stars were estimated from their bolometric magnitude and effective temperature using conversion factors\ntaken from Reed (1998).\nIllustrative results for 4 evolution tracks in the HR diagram are shown in Fig. 12; these are for donors stars that\nhad initial masses of 4, 6, 8, and 10 M\u2299 and were on the zeroage main sequence at the start of mass transfer. Each binary\nsystem is represented by two different evolution tracks in\nthe HR diagram; the thin curve is the contribution from the\ndonor star alone, while the thicker curve (of the same color)\ndescribes the track for the total system light \u2013 both disk and\ndonor star. In each case, it is clear that during the early part\nof the binary evolution where the donor star is still on the\nmain sequence, the contribution from the heated accretion\ndisk leads to a brighter optical counterpart in the V band\nby about 1 magnitude. However, during the short-lived giant branch phase, when the X-ray luminosity is very much\nlarger, the V-band magnitudes are enhanced by \u223c 4 magnitudes and the system colors are considerably bluer. Thus,\nwe conclude that there is a substantial contribution to both\nthe color and magnitude of the optical counterparts of the\nblack-hole ULXs from the accretion disk. Moreover, we note\nthat the contribution of the donor star to the optical light\nof the system may be considerably less than might be expected from a star of the same initial mass, especially if the\nmass transfer commences early in the evolution of the donor\nstar. These facts should be taken into account by observers\ntrying to characterize the \"donor star\" from its location in\nan HR diagram (M. Pakull, private communication).\n\nIn summary, our calculations indicate that with a plausible set of assumptions, a majority of the ULXs with\n40\n\u22121\nin spiral galaxies can be understood\nLx <\n\u223c 10 ergs s\nin terms of binary systems containing stellar-mass black\nholes. The systems can be evolved theoretically from the\nprimordial binary phase through the ULX phase-and the\nabsolute numbers of such systems in the populations that\nare computed are in agreement with the observations to\norder-of-magnitude accuracy. By contrast, the same claims\ncannot yet be made for the model of ULXs that invokes\nintermediate-mass black holes. Such a model, of course, has\nthe advantages that (1) the Eddington limit presents no difficulties, and (2) the spectra of some of the ULXs which\nexhibit low inner-disk temperatures (see, e.g., Miller et al.\n2003; Cropper et al. 2004) may be a natural consequence\nof more massive black holes. However, in the context of the\nIMBH model, ideas as to how such objects are formed, acquire binary companions, and are \"fed\" at the requisite accretion rates are only just beginning to be explored (see,\ne.g., Portegies Zwart et al. 2004; Portegies Zwart, Dewi, &\nMaccarone 2004; and references therein).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Ed Colbert, Miriam Krauss, Ron Remillard, and\nTim Roberts for helpful discussions.
