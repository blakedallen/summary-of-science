A complete sample of 316 dense clumps was\ndetected with a mass range from around 13 to 2500 M\u2299 . Part of the W 3 GMC is\nsubject to an interaction with the Hii region and fast stellar winds generated by the\nnearby W 4 OB association. We find that the fraction of total gas mass in dense, 850\u03bcm traced structures is significantly altered by this interaction, being around 5% to\n13% in the undisturbed cloud but \u223c25 \u2013 37% in the feedback-affected region. The mass\ndistribution in the detected clump sample depends somewhat on assumptions of dust\ntemperature and is not a simple, single power law but contains significant structure\nat intermediate masses. This structure is likely to be due to crowding of sources near\nor below the spatial resolution of the observations. There is little evidence of any\ndifference between the index of the high-mass end of the clump mass function in the\ncompressed region and in the unaffected cloud. The consequences of these results are\ndiscussed in terms of current models of triggered star formation.\nKey words: stars: formation; ISM: clouds; ISM: individual: W 3; submillimetre\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe most general observable quantities in star-forming regions that can be related to predictive models are the starformation efficiency (SFE) and the initial mass function\n(IMF). The average SFE is generally low (6 1%, Duerr,\nImhoff & Lada 1982) in molecular clouds in the Galaxy and\nin normal external galaxies but can increase dramatically\n(by up to \u223c 50 times) in starburst galaxies (Sanders et al.\n1991) and galaxy mergers, an effect which has been linked\nto strong feedback and enhancements in average gas density\n(e.g. Rownd & Young 1999).\nThe origin of the stellar IMF is not yet clear, but one\npossibility is that it is directly physically related to the\nrather similar mass function of the dense clumps that are\nformed in the turbulent environment of star forming regions\n(e.g. Clarke 1998 and references therein; Nutter & WardThompson 2007). If so, then the stellar IMF is determined by\nthe physics of star formation and the basic nature of molecular clouds. While the observed mass function in dense clumps\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: tjtm@astro.livjm.ac.uk\n\nis somewhat variable from region to region (e.g. Johnstone\net al. 2000; 2001), there is little strong evidence of significant\nvariations in the stellar IMF (Massey 2003).\nTurbulent fragmentation models of star formation (e.g.\nPadoan & Nordlund 2002) predict that complete Salpeterlike mass functions of gravitationally bound dense clumps\nwill form spontanously in molecular clouds with driven turbulence. Such models also suggest that the SFE is determined by a combination of the scale on which the turbulence\nis driven and the Mach number of the driven turbulence\n(e.g. V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2003). This is the paradigm\nof spontaneous star formation.\nInvestigating the physical basis for the idea of triggered star formation, Whitworth et al. (1994) modelled\nthe shocked, compressed cloud layers formed by interactions. They concluded that the dynamical instabilities in the\nshocked gas generate new density structure, some of which\nsubsequently collapses, and predicted that higher-mass stars\nshould be preferentially formed under these conditions. Lim,\nFalle & Hartquist (2005) modelled the evolution of a cloud\ncontaining a significant magnetic field subject to a sudden\nincrease in external pressure. Their simulation predicts the\n\n\f2\n\nT. J. T.

Overview of the W 3 GMC and the area immediately to the east. The grey scale shows MSX 8-\u03bcm emission delineating the\nedge of the W 4 Hii region and the luminous star-formation regions in the eastern layer of W 3. The white contours are integrated 12 CO\nJ=1\u20130 emission from the FCRAO Outer Galaxy Survey (Heyer et al. 1998). The positions of the O stars of the IC 1805 cluster (Massey\net al. 1995) are shown as circles.\n\nformation of new dense structures, in which the thermal and\nmagnetic pressures are comparable, which are potential sites\nof high-mass star formation.\nSurveys of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), the sites\nof cluster formation, provide the observational constraints\nwithin which theoretical models must operate. Thermal\nemission from the cold dust present in molecular clouds\npeaks in the submillimetre, and is a reliably optically thin\ntracer of column density. Hence observations in the submillimetre continuum are ideally suited to locating and\nquantifying the dense structure which contains the current\nand incipient star formation (e.g. Johnstone et al. 2000).\nThe W 3 GMC is a high-mass star-forming region located in the outer Galaxy, in the Perseus spiral arm, at\nl \u2243 134o and a distance of \u223c2.0 kpc (e.g. Hachisuka et\nal. 2006) from the Sun. The cloud occupies a well defined\n\n1.5 \u00d7 1.5 degree area and is one of the most massive molecular clouds in the outer Galaxy (Heyer & Terebey 1998).\nFigure 1 shows the location of the W 3 cloud, its proximity to the IC 1805 OB association, the boundary of the W 4\nHii region and the location of the high-mass star formation\nwithin the cloud itself as traced at 8\u03bcm by MSX.\nApproximately 40% of the cloud's total mass (Allsopp\net al., 2007) is located in a layer of strong CO emission\nreferred to as the high-density layer (HDL) by Lada et al.\n(1978). The HDL occupies the eastern edge of the GMC and\nruns parallel to the edge of the W 4 Hii region. It is likely\nto have formed from compression of the cloud gas resulting from the expansion of the Hii region and/or the ram\npressure from the fast stellar winds from the W 4 OB association. The luminous, massive star-forming regions within\nthe HDL, (W 3 Main, W 3 (OH) and AFGL 333), are likely\nto be examples of triggered star formation.

The W 3 GMC thus\nprovides a useful specimen for studying the differences between induced and spontaneous star formation independent\nof initial conditions.\nThis paper presents the results of a census of starformation activity and dense structure in the W 3 GMC,\nmade to test the predictions of models such as those mentioned above and to look for differences in the mass distribution and fractional mass in dense structures that can be\nrelated to the spatial variation in local conditions.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe observations were made during 2001 July 17\u201324 and\n26, using the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array\n(SCUBA) receiver (Holland et al. 1999) on the 15-m James\n\nClerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). SCUBA is a dual-camera\nsystem, with 91 bolometers optimized for performance at\n450 \u03bcm and 37 bolometers for 850 \u03bcm. The spatial resolution at 450 \u03bcm is 8 arcsec at FWHM and at 850 \u03bcm it is 14\narcsec. The two arrays observe simultaneously but the atmospheric opacity at the time of the observations was too high\nfor photometric 450-\u03bcm data to be obtained. Consequently,\nonly the 850-\u03bcm data are considered in what follows. The\nSCUBA field of view is \u223c2.3 arcmin across. An area of 3150\narcmin2 , encompassing the HDL and the southern portion\nof the W 3 GMC, was surveyed (Figure 2).\nSince the W 3 GMC is considerably larger than the array field of view, the data were obtained in scan-mapping\nmode using the \"Emerson II\" observing technique. A differential map of the source was generated by scanning the\narray across individual 10-arcmin square fields whilst the\nsecondary mirror chopped in right ascension or declination\nby one of three small chop throws \u2013 30 arcsec, 44 arcsec or\n\n\f4\n\nT. J. T. Moore, et al.\nsmoothed map was found to be \u223c13 mJy, which is equivalent to 56 mJy per beam.\n\n68 arcsec. Thus each 10-arcmin square submap comprises\nsix component maps of three chop throws in two directions.\nPointing observations were made toward W 3 (OH) every \u223c90 minutes, and found to vary by less than 6 arcsec\nin Right Ascension and Declination. The zenith atmospheric\nopacity was estimated by performing skydips approximately\nevery hour. The average atmospheric opacity at 850 \u03bcm was\n0.356, whilst the maximum and minimum values were determined to be 0.702 and 0.185 respectively.\nData reduction was done using the software package\nsurf (Jenness & Lightfoot 1998). The data were flat-fielded,\nextinction corrected and despiked. Noisy bolometers were\nidentified and blanked. Due to the difficulty inherent in identifying emission-free regions for the purposes of signal baseline removal, the median level was removed from each scan\n(Johnstone et al. 2000). A model of the sky atmospheric\nemission was calculated and removed from the scan-map\ndata.\nThe data were flux calibrated using observations of\nUranus and the planetary nebula CRL 618. The Starlink\nprogram fluxes was used to calculate flux densities for\nUranus, whilst the flux density of CRL 618 was assumed to\nbe 4.56 \u00b1 0.17 Jy at 850 \u03bcm. The derived flux conversion factors were applied to the individual chop-maps prior to rebinning. Calibration is estimated to be accurate to 6%, based\non the root mean square deviation of the flux conversions\nfactors. The rebinned chop-maps were then mosaiced together with other maps taken with the same chop configuration. The resulting six large maps were Fourier-transformed\nand combined in Fourier space; a filter was applied to remove data at spatial frequencies above SCUBA's sensitivity\nthreshold (ie structure smaller than the beam). An inverse\nFT then generated the reconstructed map (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 3 shows that the strongest 850-\u03bcm emission is located in the HDL region along the eastern edge of the\ncloud. The conspicuously bright sources in the northern\npart of this strip correspond to the known star-formation\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nregions W 3 Main (at ra \u2243 2h 25m 38s , dec \u2243 +62\u25e6 05 58 )\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nand W 3 (OH) (2h 27m 05s , +61\u25e6 52 05 ). There is a considerable amount of strong emission in the environs of these\ntwo sources. The W 3 North star-forming region is also dis\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\ntinguishable at (2h 26m 54s , +62\u25e6 16 06 ). Further to the\nsouth along the HDL, the AFGL 333 region (2h 28m 09s ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n+61\u25e6 30 00 ) has a beaded, filamentary appearance. North\neast of AFGL 333 there is a bright pointlike source corresponding to the position of the known outflow IC 1805-W\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n(2h 29m 03s , +61\u25e6 33 29 ) associated with IRAS point source\n02252+6120.\nIn the south-western portion of the map the continuum emission is of much lower average intensity. Many compact features are detected, however, including a group of\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nsources near (2h 25m 39s , +61\u25e6 13 34 ) and a sinuous filah\nm\nment which runs from ra \u223c 2 22 25s to \u223c 2h 20m 30s , dec\n\u2032\n\u223c +61\u25e6 06 . Immediately west of this filament is a loop of\nsources associated with, and possibly formed by the expansion of the KR 140 compact Hii region (Kerton et al. 2001).\nNorth of KR 140, a prominent group of sources is located at\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n(2h 21m 06s , +61\u25e6 27 28 ).\n\n2.1\n\n3.2\n\nSuppression of extended structure\n\nIn SCUBA's scan-mapping mode, spatial scales more extended than a few times the maximum chop throw are measured with significantly reduced sensitivity. However, the observing and map reconstruction methods described above\nproduced semi-periodic apparent structure on scales similar\nto the size of the individual scan maps (10 arcmins) with\namplitude \u223c 0.15 \u2212 0.2 Jy per pixel (4 to 5 times the unsmoothed pixel-pixel rms noise; see below).\nIn order to suppress this spurious extended structure,\na template was constructed by subtracting and interpolating over all strong steep-gradient sources from the reduced\nmap and smoothing the result with a Gaussian function of\nFWHM 80 arcsec (a little larger than the maximum chop\nthrow). This template was subtracted from the original reduced map and the resulting image was smoothed to the\nresolution of the telescope (14 arcsec) to yield the final processed map (Figure 3). Removal of the extended structure\nfrom the map is largely cosmetic and introduces additional\nflux measurement uncertainties and necessarily deletes a certain amount of real low-frequency structure. It also tends\nto produce slight negative 'dishing' around the brightest\nsources. The latter is difficult to avoid in the more crowded\nregions where merged sources and the artifacts become difficult to distinguish, and sources are difficult to remove accurately in the creation of the background template.\nThe mean pixel-to-pixel rms noise in the processed,\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nGeneral features of the processed map\n\nSource detection\n\nIndividual 850-\u03bcm sources were identified using clfind2d\n(version of 6/10/04) a two-dimensional adaptation of the\nWilliams, de Geus and Blitz (1994) clump-finding algorithm,\nclfind. This technique decomposes the data into a set of discrete clumps by first (virtually) contouring the map at a series of levels set by the user. The clumps are then located by\nidentifying emission peaks and tracing closed contours down\nto lower intensities. Williams et al. (1994) provide a detailed\ndescription of the algorithm's methodology and performance\ntesting with simulated data. The advantages of clfind are\nthat it does not assume any a priori source profile and that\nit is an objective technique. Its weaknesses are mainly those\nassociated with the separation of crowded objects and the\ninclusion of spurious sources at low levels, which are common to all object-detection routines.\nclfind defines a clump boundary as the least significant\ncontour surrounding the parent emission peak. This boundary is signal-to-noise dependent and not necessarily related\nto any physical outer radius. This should introduce a bias\nagainst extended, low-surface-brightness objects. If the detection contour is set low so as to minimise this bias, this\nwill result in the overestimation of the fluxes of faint sources,\nrelative to standard aperture photometry, since source fluxes\nare integrated over all pixels within this boundary.\nclfind2d was run with input contour levels at 1\u03c3\n(13 mJy), 2\u03c3 (27 mJy) and 3\u03c3 (40 mJy) then at 3-\u03c3 intervals\n\n\fThe star-forming content of the W 3 GMC\n\n5\n\n20'\n\no\n\nDeclination\n\n62 00'\n\n40'\n\n20'\n\n61o00'\n\n60 o40'\nm\n\n28\n\nm\n\n24\nRight ascension\n\nm\n\n2h20\n\nFigure 3.

The continuum emission is shown in negative logarithmic\ngrey scale and the cloud boundary is marked in grey contours, as in Figure 2.\n\nup to the peak signal of 14.2 Jy per pixel. The low sigma levels were included in order to ensure detection of faint but significant sources. With \u223c18 pixels inside the half-maximum\nradius of an unresolved source, a 5-sigma detection may have\na peak flux surface brightness that is barely above the 1-\u03c3\nlevel. It also enables us to examine the spectrum of noise\nin the data and to measure the source detection and completeness limits, since these can not immediately be inferred\nfrom the pixel-to-pixel noise. In any case, adjacent pixels are\nnot independent because of the data reconstruction process.\n'Detections' less than 68 arcsec (the maximum chop throw)\nfrom the map edges were rejected since, in these marginal\nregions, the residual noise is greatest, coverage is incomplete\nand reconstructed fluxes are unreliable.\nThe distribution of the resulting sample, which is dominated by noise, is presented in Figure 4 as a histogram of\nequal-width flux bins. Also shown in Figure 4 is the distribution of an equivalent sample obtained with the object\ndetection routines in the Starlink gaia package (which uses\n\nSExtractor: Bertin & Arnouts 1996). This extraction used\nelliptical isophotal fitting with the same detection limit. The\ntwo distributions are very similar except at very low flux levels well below the completeness limit.\n3.3\n\nCompleteness\n\nFigure 4 shows the combined noise spectrum and source flux\ndistribution. It also shows that it is not easy to distinguish\nthe boundary between noise sources and real detections in\nthese data by simple inspection.\nIn order to define a completeness limit, we introduced 50\nartificial point sources, repeatedly and at random positions,\ninto each of two otherwise blank regions of the reduced and\nflattened image (Fig. 3) and used clfind2d to recover them\nand measure fluxes. By doing this, we find that the recovery\nrate is 100% down to flux densities of 113 mJy per beam,\ndropping to 50% at 28 mJy per beam.\nThe 1-sigma rms noise in the processed, smoothed map\n\n\f6\n\nT.

Distribution of the fluxes of all clfind2d detections\nabove the 1-\u03c3 per-pixel noise. The distribution is dominated by\nthe noise spectrum at low flux levels. The dashed histogram shows\nthe results obtained using gaia object detection.\n\nis 13.3 mJy per pixel or 56 mJy per beam. A completeness\nlimit of 113 mJy therefore corresponds to a 2-sigma detection and represents the total flux density of an unresolved\nsource which can be reliably recovered from the image using clfind2d. Clearly, extended sources must have higher\ncompleteness limits.\nThis is not the end of the story, however, since we also\nneed to know the flux level at which all detected sources are\nreal. In other words, the limit of effectively zero contamination by spurious noise sources. By running clfind2d on\nthe same two apparently empty regions of the image, we extracted a spectrum of detections resulting only from noise.\nScaling these spectra by relative area to the total source\nflux distribution in Fig. 3, we find that contamination is\nsignificant (> 25% or around 1 detection per 10 square arcminutes) at flux densities of 225 mJy per beam and below,\nbut effectively zero at 280 mJy and above. The latter is 2.5\ntimes the completeness limit obtained from the source recovery tests and around five times the nominal 1-sigma noise (in\nmJy per beam). The latter flux density limit, which gives us\na sample of 316 real sources, is adopted in what follows. The\nlocation of these sources within the survey area is plotted in\nFigure 5.\n\n3.4\n\nDust temperatures and clump masses\n\nUnder the assumption that the 850-\u03bcm emission is optically\nthin, gas masses can be estimated from source flux densities\nS\u03bd using\nM=\n\nS\u03bd D 2\n,\n\u03ba\u03bd B\u03bd (Td )\n\n(1)\n\n\u0010\n\n17K\nTd\n\n\u0011\n\ni\n\n\u2212 1 M\u2299\n\n(2)\n\nwhere S850 , the total 850-\u03bcm flux density within the clump\nboundary, is measured in Janskys.\nDust temperatures were estimated from gas kinetic temperatures obtained from our own ammonia inversion-line\nmeasurements of a subsample of 44 clumps (Allsopp et al.\n2007). Td values were assigned in two ways, in order to investigate the effect on the measured clump mass function. In\nthe first, we assigned a single dust temperature to all sources,\nequal to the median NH3 value in the measured subsample\nfor the relevant cloud region. These values were 18 K for the\nHDL and 14 K for the diffuse region. Uncertainties in these\ntemperature estimates can cause large errors in calculated\nmasses. A 30% uncertainty in the above values creates an\nerror of around \u201330%, +100%, in calculated mass. In the\nsecond method, measured NH3 gas temperatures were assigned to specific clumps, where available. The rest of the\nsample was assigned temperatures randomly from the set of\nNH3 temperatures in the relevant section of the cloud (Diffuse region or HDL). Figure 6 shows the distribution of NH3\ntemperatures used.\nThe properties of all 850-\u03bcm sources above the contamination limit are listed in Table 1. The source coordinates\ncorrespond to the peak flux positions and the total flux densities are without background subtraction, since the latter\nis insignificant after the removal of large scale structure in\nthe map.\n\n3.5\n\nThe clump mass spectrum\n\nFigure 7 shows the distribution of clump masses, for sources\nwith integrated 850-\u03bcm flux densities above the 280-mJy\ncontamination limit, in both the HDL and diffuse cloud\nregion. The masses entering these distributions are calculated using both a fixed dust temperature and actual and\nrandomly-assigned NH3 temperatures (see above), averaged\nover 20 repeats in the latter case. These histograms have, as\nnear as possible, equal population bins (and hence unequal\nbin widths) and are plotted as the log of the bin population per unit log bin width. The distributions in the latter\ncase turn over below log M \u223c 1.1 for the HDL clumps and\n\u223c 1.3 for the diffuse cloud data. This is due to the combination of the flux completeness limit and the distribution of\ntemperatures.\nThe single-temperature mass functions obviously follow\nthe flux distribution and are far from a single, simple power\nlaw in either of the two subsets. There is distinct structure\naround log M = 1.8 in both subsamples. This structure is\nstill evident in the HDL data when actual and random temperatures from the NH3 distribution are assigned to clumps\n\n\fThe star-forming content of the W 3 GMC\n\n7\n\n20'\n\no\n\nDeclination\n\n62 00'\n\n40'\n\n20'\n\n61o00'\n\n60 o40'\nm\n\n28\n\nm\n\n24\nRight ascension\n\nm\n\n2h20\n\nFigure 5.

It does not appear in the diffuse cloud sample\nin the latter model.\nAbove the completeness turnover masses, a single, linear\nfit to the averaged HDL logarithmic mass function produced\nby the distributed-temperature model has a negative powerlaw index of 0.50 \u00b1 0.05. This fit includes the log M = 1.8\nstructure and does not represent the data well. The equivalent fit for the diffuse-cloud sample produces an index of\n0.66 \u00b1 0.06. Above the apparent structure at log M = 1.8,\nthe HDL mass function is steeper (index 0.85 \u00b1 0.02) and\nmore consistent with a single power law. The equivalent part\nof the diffuse-cloud data gives the same fitted index, within\nthe uncertainties, i.e. 0.80 \u00b1 0.06. Note that, in this form of\nthe mass function, the canonical Salpeter stellar IMF has an\nindex of 1.35.\nIn the single-temperature model (Figure 7a), a fit to all\nthe data gives results similar to those above. Fitting only\nto data with log M > 1.8 gives 0.92 \u00b1 0.06 for the HDL\n\nsample index and 1.19 \u00b1 0.07 for the diffuse cloud sample.\nThe former is consistent with the distributed-temperature\nmodel, but the latter is steeper, and rather closer to the\nSalpeter-like mass functions found in other studies.\nIf we consider only clumps with measured NH3 gas temperatures, and use these as dust-temperature estimates, the\nmass-function fits have indices of 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 for the HDL and\n0.50 \u00b1 0.06 for the diffuse cloud. These are consistent with\nthe fits to all data in both temperature models, the larger\nerror on the HDL result reflecting the persistent appearance\nof structure in the mass function in this subsample.\nMany other determinations of clump mass functions use\nonly those sources without evidence of star formation. For\nconsistency in the W 3 sample, all we can do in this regard\nis remove the few clumps with IRAS and MSX Point Source\ncatalogue detections. There are 29 MSX point sources with\n8-\u03bcm detections within 10\u2032\u2032 of a SCUBA 850-\u03bcm source and\na further 27 within 20\u2032\u2032 . The former should be a reasonable\n\n\f8\n\nT.

If the 10\u2032\u2032\nassociations are removed from the sample, using the singletemperature model and fitting to log M > 1.8, we get indices\nof 0.92 \u00b1 0.06 and 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 for the HDL and diffuse-cloud\nclumps, respectively. The former is not significantly different\nfrom the result using the whole sample, while the latter is.\nRemoving the 20\u2032\u2032 associations as well produces 0.94 \u00b1 0.07\nand 1.7 \u00b1 0.4.\n3.6\n\nThe fraction of gas mass in dense structures\n\nThe total gas mass in the HDL and diffuse cloud regions was\nestimated from maps of the whole W 3 GMC in the 13 CO\nJ=1\u20130 rotational transition made at the FCRAO 14-m telescope (Allsopp et al. in preparation). In order to calculate H2\ncolumn densities, the LTE approximation was assumed with\na single excitation temperature of 30 K. The latter value is\nconsistent with the colour temperature of the diffuse dust\nemission in IRAS extended emission maps (Bretherton 2003)\nand adopting a higher temperature for the diffuse CO-traced\ngas than the dense ammonia-traced clumps accounts for the\nlikely greater penetration of the diffuse gas by radiation. At\ntemperatures above \u223c10 K, the column density calculated\nfrom CO 1\u20130 is roughly proportional to the assumed exitation temperature. The probable error introduced by our\nassumption of 30 K here is therefore no greater than other\nuncertainties in calculating absolute column densities (see\nbelow). The 13 CO/H2 relative abundance was assumed to\nbe 1.25 \u00d7 10\u22126 and, for the purposes of this estimate only,\nthe 13 CO emission was assumed to be optically thin everywhere.\nCorrecting for spatial oversampling and telescope beam\n\nFigure 7. Distribution of masses of detected clumps above the\nnoise contamination limit: HDL (triangles) and Diffuse cloud (circles) samples.

One\nhas been added to mass bins to remove the possibility of taking\nthe log of zero in an empty bin.\n\nefficiency, the total gas mass of the GMC was found to be\n3.8 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 . The mass in the HDL and the entire diffuse\ncloud region west of the HDL was 1.5\u00d7105 and 2.3\u00d7105 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively. These estimates have a systematic uncertainty\nwhich is a factor of order 2 \u2013 5 arising largely from the assumed relative abundances and CO excitation temperature.\nThe corresponding CO-traced mass in the portion of the\ndiffuse cloud region mapped with SCUBA is 1.15 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 .\nThe estimated total cloud mass gives an average gas\ndensity for the whole GMC of only 4 \u00d7 107 m\u22123 , assuming\nthe cloud is as deep along the line of sight as it is wide. This\nis rather typical of GMC's and means that the volume filling\nfactor is < 5%, if the CO-traced molecular gas density is\nabove the critical density for the 1\u20130 transition (\u223c 109 m\u22123\nfor T \u2243 30 K).\nThe total mass in dense clumps with 850-\u03bcm flux densities above the contamination limit of 280 mJy per beam is\n3.8\u00d7104 and 6.1\u00d7103 M\u2299 in these two regions, respectively.\n\n\fThe star-forming content of the W 3 GMC\nThese figures assume the single-temperature model. Using\nthe temperature-distribution model the mass estimates are\naround 10% higher. The uncertainty in these masses is dominated by errors in the assumed values of dust emissivity (see\nHenning et al. 1995) and dust temperature, and are a factor\nof order 2\u20133. This uncertainty is, again, largely systematic\nsince we are dealing here with the sum over the sample.\nThese mass values indicate that the detected fraction of gas\nin the form of dense clumps is 0.26 in the HDL and 0.05 in\nthe diffuse cloud. These values are subject to the systematic\nerrors in the mass estimates, which combine into a factor of\n4 or 5 but the difference between them is robust.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nGeneral results\n\nThe reduced 850-\u03bcm map of W 3 (Figure 3) reveals that the\nbrightest sub-millimetre sources and a large fraction (86% by\nmass; 69% by number) of the detected sources above the contamination limit of \u223c 13 M\u2299 are located in the HDL. This\nis not surprising, since the HDL contains the majority of\nthe infrared sources associated with the cloud, several wellknown massive star-forming regions (W 3 IRS5, W 3 (OH),\nNGC 333) each containing clusters of (ultra) compact H ii\nregions, and other phenomena associated with massive star\nformation, such as masers (e.g. OH and methanol: Etoka,\nCohen & Gray 2005) as well as energetic bipolar molecular\noutflows (e.g. Mitchell, Hasegawa & Schella 1992). This region of the cloud is apparently compressed by the expanding\nHii region and/or the stellar winds from the W 4 OB association and is likely to be the site of significant triggered star\nformation.\nLess predictably, we have found that there is a significant amount of dense structure in regions of the W 3 GMC\nwhich are far less affected by interactions. 14% by mass and\n31% by number of the dense clumps were found in the portion of the surveyed area away from the HDL (Figure 5). The\nobjects in this diffuse cloud region are all rather low mass,\nthe brightest being almost an order of magnitude fainter\nthan the brightest source in the HDL sample, but the lack\nof high-mass clumps is consistent with statistics, as demonstrated by the similarity in the high-mass slope of the mass\nfunction (see above). The sources in the diffuse cloud are\nmuch less densely packed than in the HDL. It therefore appears that there is active, albeit far less dramatic, star formation activity in the cloud away from the regions where\ntriggering by external interactions is dominant. This star\nformation is likely to be associated with the natural turbulence in the cloud as predicted by, e.g., Padoan & Nordlund\n(2002), although it is not possible to say that the diffuse\ncloud region is free of external interactions. The KR 140 Hii\nregion at least appears to have triggered the formation of\na few small condensations by expanding into the southwest\ncorner of the cloud (Kerton et al. 2001).\nGiven that the observing technique is insensitive to\nemission that is extended on scales larger than the largest\nchop throw, 68 arcsec, we can only be concerned with the\npoint-like sources in this study. Despite this, there is some\nevidence in Figure 2 of a ridge of extended emission running\nthrough the middle of the HDL region, south from W 3 (OH).\n\n9\n\nThis putative feature may have partly survived the method\nbecause it is rather narrow in this region, but it has been\nfurther reduced by the large-scale background removal that\nproduces the final map (Fig. 3) and its significance is not\nconsidered further here.\nThe northern half of the western section of the cloud is\nnot covered by the present survey. We can assume that it is\nsimilar in its physical state and star-formation content to the\nsurveyed southern half but none of the conclusions we draw\nis dependent on this assumption. There is evidence of star\nformation activity in this northern region (Bretherton 2003)\nand there have been suggestions that this part of the cloud\ninteracts with the HB3 (G 132.6+1.5) supernova remnant\n(Routledge et al. 1991).\n4.2\n\nThe clump sample\n\nThese observations give us a complete census of the dense,\npotentially star-forming structures in the W 3 GMC. We\nhave used the resulting sample to construct the two basic\nquantities which define the star-forming content: the distribution of masses (mass function) and the fraction of the total\ncloud mass in dense structures that may produce stars. The\nfact that this particular GMC is experiencing a major feedback interaction which affects only a well-defined section of\nthe cloud has allowed us to look for quantitative differences\nin these two parameters that we might relate to the effects\nof the interaction.\nThe conservative limit to the sample reliability is the\nnoise-contamination limit at 280 mJy. Given our dust temperature and other assumptions above, this gives the sample\na lower mass limit of around 13 M\u2299 . The sample of Enoch\net al. (2006) from Perseus overlaps this, extending from a\ncompleteness limit of 0.8 M\u2299 to around 30 M\u2299 .\nAbove this limit, we have detected 316 sources, including 15 out of 20 of the relatively faint objects found in the\nsouthwest corner of the cloud by Kerton et al. (2001), who\nalso used SCUBA scan-mapping at 850\u03bcm. However, the\n850-\u03bcm fluxes we obtain using clfind2d are three times\nlarger, on average, than the values Kerton et al. (2001)\nmeasured using photometry within polygonal apertures. The\n850-\u03bcm fluxes are correlated, but flux ratios vary between 1\nand 5, with a standard deviation of 1.3. The systematic discrepancy is partly due to the different photometry method\n(\u00a73.2) which will have the greatest effect on the weakest\nsources.\n4.3\n\nThe dense clump mass function\n\nThe observed mass function in W 3 is not a simple, single\npower law. There is evidence of a persistent feature, a slope\nreversal or peak, at masses of around 60 M\u2299 (Figure 7). The\norigin of this feature appears to be in the combination of the\nscale on which sources are clustered (both physical clustering\nand superimpositions by chance along the line of sight) and\nthe spatial resolution of the data. It should be noted that\nmost, if not all, of the clumps detected in W 3 are likely to\nform or be forming embedded clusters of stars. All objects\nabove the completeness limit are more massive than those\nin Motte et al. (1998) that contain substructure. The W 3\nclump mass function may, therefore, be more analagous to\na stellar cluster mass function.\n\n\f10\n\nT. J. T. Moore, et al.\n\u2022 The complex shape of the mass distribution measured\nin the HDL clumps (Figure 7), including slope reversal and\npeak, is reproduced qualitatively when the clustering scale\nbecomes comparable to the spatial resolution.\n\u2022 As the clustering becomes more severe, the position of\nthe peak in the mass distribution moves toward higher mass\nbins.\n\u2022 The most likely origin of the observed reversal feature is\nin clustering of sources at and below the spatial resolution,\nand not in any physical effect such as a second population\nof clumps with a lower-mass cutoff around 60 M\u2299 .\n\nFigure 8. The results of using clfind2d to recover a series of\nMonte Carlo simulations of sources with varying degrees of clustering. Square symbols represent a sequence with purely random\npositions. Triangles and circles respectively represent sequences\nwith Gaussian clustering probability distributions having \u03c3 \u2243 0.8\nand 0.5 times the spatial resolution. The dashed lines are added\nto clarify the separate sequences. The mass scale is somewhat arbitrary, and results from the selected input flux distribution (see\ntext).\n\nWhere clustering causes small individual sources to\nmerge so that they appear to be single, large objects, their\nmass will be counted in a higher-mass bin. In general,\nwe might expect to find crowding depopulates the low- to\nintermediate-mass bins, since the most massive sources will\nbe rare enough that they are less likely to be merged together or to have their fluxes significantly altered by the\naddition of smaller objects.\nFigure 8 shows the result of a Monte-Carlo simulation\nof this effect, generated as follows. 500 fluxes were extracted\nat random from a power-law distribution N (F ) \u221d F \u22121.35\n(matching the Salpeter IMF distribution) with limits 0.3 to\n100 Jy. These fluxes were assigned random positions within\na source-free, \u223c 32 \u00d7 10 arcmins area of the 850-\u03bcm map.\nWhere source clustering was required, ten seed fluxes were\nplaced in the field at random and the assigned positions of\nthe rest were modified with a Gaussian probability distribution based on proximity to a previously placed object.\nThe resulting field, with its 500 artifical point sources, was\nsmoothed to the resolution of the data (14.3 arcsec) and\nthen the sources were recovered with clfind2d exactly as\nfor the observed data. This process was repeated 10 times for\neach simulation and the resulting mass distributions (based\non dust temperatures of 18 K) constructed. Results of three\ndifferent simulations are shown in Figure 8. These are for\nrandom positions (i.e. no clustering), for a Gaussian clustering probability with standard deviation (\u03c3) equal to 3.9\npixels (12 arcsec or 0.8 times the spatial resolution), and\nfor \u03c3 = 2.2 pixels (7 arcsec or about 0.5 times the spatial\nresolution). The results of this analysis are:\n\nA more detailed analysis of this effect may enable us to\nestimate the physical clustering at scales near and below the\nspatial resolution limit but this is beyond the scope of this\npaper. In the mean time, it is interesting to point out that\na just-resolved object with a mass equal to our sample limit\n(13 M\u2299 ) would have a thermal (T = 20 K) Jeans length of\n\u223c 0.05 pc, close to the apparent clustering scale implied by\nthe simulation.\nAs mentioned above, we might expect the highest mass\nclumps to be not significantly affected by crowding at the\nresolution scale. We might thus expect to recover the original clump mass function index at the high-mass end of the\ndistribution. Except where a single temperature is applied,\nthe fitted power laws to the upper end of the mass functions in the two subsamples (\u00a73.5) have exponents \u223c 0.84,\nsignificantly flatter than that of a Salpeter IMF (1.35).\nSimilarly flat mass distributions have been found in CO\nstudies of cloud structures (e.g. Williams et al. 2000), but\nthose of the dense clumps traced by mm and submm wavelength data have generally yielded high-end power laws consistent with the Salpeter stellar IMF (e.g. Motte et al 1998;\nJohnstone et al. 2000; Enoch et al. 2006) or steeper (e.g.\nJohnstone et al. 2001; Kirk et al. 2006). The reasons for the\ndiscrepancy between the molecular-line and (sub)mm continuum data are not clear. There has been much speculation\nin the literature of a direct connection between these submillimetre clump mass functions and the stellar IMF via\nturbulent fragmentation models of star formation. The discrepant results have not yet been fitted into such a picture\nbut note that determinations of stellar cluster mass functions yield power-law exponents between 0.95 and 1.4 in\nour formulation, slightly flatter, on average, than Salpeter\n(Zhang & Fall 1999, Lada & Lada 2003, Hunter et al. 2003)\nIt is worth noting that the observed mass function will\ntend towards the cluster mass function in the limit of strong\nclustering, and towards the clump mass function in the\nlimit of zero clustering. Further, in the intermediate case,\nthe existence of a cluster distribution similar to the clump\nmass function (ie with fewer high-mass clusters) will tend to\nsteepen the observed clump spectrum (Weidner & Kroupa\n2005). This occurs when the slope of the mass function of\nindividual clumps is preserved within clusters. Then many\nlow-mass, and therefore truncated clump mass functions are\nsuperimposed on just a few high-mass clusters that extend\nover the whole mass range.\nNo clear difference has been found in the index at the\nhigh-mass end of the clump mass function (above 60 M\u2299 )\nbetween the HDL and the diffuse cloud subsamples. A difference does emerge when objects associated with MSX 8\u03bcm point sources are removed. In this case the diffuse-cloud\n\n\fThe star-forming content of the W 3 GMC\nmass function steepens into a power law consistent with\nSalpeter (\u00a73.5). This could mean that the fraction of clumps\nwith embedded stars (and so evolutionary status) is more\nmass dependent in the diffuse cloud. However, this result\nmust be treated with some caution as it may be the result\nof the MSX flux limit falling relatively high up in this lowermass subsample. Any other differences between the two mass\ndistributions can be accounted for by the increased density\nof sources and the greater degree of crowding in the HDL\nregion.\nThe foregoing analysis, and the likelihood of unresolved\nclustering, shows that decoding the observed mass spectrum\nin W 3 is a complex problem. Until the spatial resolution\navailable at these wavelengths is significantly improved, few\nstrong constraints can be placed on the underlying distribution of clump masses, other than that they may be distributed as a power law with a negative exponent.\n4.4\n\nThe fraction of mass in dense clumps\n\nUsing 12 CO J=1\u20130 data, Lada et al. (1978) found the total\nmass of the W 3 GMC to be \u223c7\u00d7104 M\u2299 . They estimated\nmasses of \u223c4\u00d7104 M\u2299 and \u223c3\u00d7104 M\u2299 for the HDL and the\ndiffuse cloud region west of the HDL, respectively. These\nare a factor of \u223c 5 lower than the estimates we use to calculate the mass fraction in dense clumps. This can probably\nbe accounted for by optical depth effects, choice of excitation temperature, undersampling in the older data, and\nassumed abundance ratios. Our figure of \u223c4 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 appears more consistent with the estimate of \u223c 106 M\u2299 for the\nwhole W 3/4/5 GMC complex by Heyer & Terebey (1998).\nThe fraction of gas mass in dense, potentially starforming structures detected in these observations is around\n26% in the HDL region and only \u223c 5% in the diffuse cloud\narea surveyed with SCUBA. These mass fractions are lower\nlimits since there must be a component of dense structures\nthat is either extended and has been 'resolved out' by the\nobserving and reduction techniques and/or consists of compact sources below the detection limit. The latter portion of\nthis missing mass can be estimated by projecting the clump\nmass functions in Figure 7 back to an assumed turnover mass\nof a little below 1 solar mass (e.g. Motte et al. 1998). The\nresult of this depends on the exponent of the mass function\nat lower masses. Adopting a very flat power-law exponent of\n\u20130.5, consistent with the fit to the whole of the HDL sample, suggests that 8% of the total mass in dense clumps is\nundetected. The equivalent missing fraction in the diffuse\ncloud sample is 23%. This implies a corrected mass fraction\nin dense clumps of 28% in the HDL and 6.5% in the diffuse\ncloud. If the exponent were as large as \u20131.5, these corrected\nmass fractions would rise to 37% and 13%, respectively.\nThere is a large uncertainty (discussed above) in these\nabsolute efficiency values, arising from adopted CO abundances and excitation, dust emissivity and temperature. The\ntwo mass fractions are, however, robust relative to each\nother. We therefore conclude that there is a significant enhancement in the efficiency with which dense, potentially\nstar-forming, structures are formed from the cloud gas where\nthat gas has been shocked by the external interaction. This\nenhancement is by a factor of at least 3 and possibly as high\nas 5.\nSince the HDL has apparently been subject to a com-\n\n11\n\npressive interaction due to the expanding W 4 Hii region,\nthis result is consistent with either of two scenarios. The\nfirst is that the effects of the interaction cause existing structures in the cloud to accrete more material and grow more\nmassive. This may be due to an increase in the signal speed\nin the compressed gas and, hence, in the accretion rate, or\nan increase in the effective Jeans mass, both of which may\nbe caused by an increase in turbulent velocities. The second\npossibility is that new dense structures are formed in the\ninteraction, in the shocks between turbulent flows or in local gravitational instabilities. An increase in the fraction of\ntotal cloud mass contained in dense clumps is not consistent\nwith a model in which feedback from previous generations\nof high-mass stars simply raises the ambient pressure and\nso increases the probability that existing structures collapse\nto form stars. Feedback mechanisms must create new dense\nstructure from which stars can form or must force more of\nthe cloud gas into accretion flows onto existing bound objects. This has a bearing on the question of how star formation efficiency is enhanced by feedback and is a clue to\nthe origin of the large increase in star-formation efficiency\nobserved in starburst galaxies, for example.\nThis result is consistent with models of triggered star\nformation in which entirely new structure forms as the result\nof an interaction (e.g. Whitworth et al., 1994, Lim et al.,\n2005). It is also consistent with AMR simulations of the\ninteraction of fast stellar winds with turbulent clouds (Jones\net al. in preparation). These models predict that density\nenhancements which form in the turbulent gas prior to the\npassage of the shock tend to continue to dominate in the\npost-shock gas. The existing clumps are either stripped (if\nthey are small) or accrete more material if they are massive\nand tightly bound. This process might be expected to flatten\nthe spontaneously formed dense clump mass function.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have surveyed two thirds of the area of the W 3 Giant\nMolecular Cloud in the 850-\u03bcm continuum at 14\u2032\u2032 resolution,\nresulting in a complete census of the star-formation activity\nin the surveyed region. The observations produced a sample\nof 316 dense clumps above a flux limit determined by contamination of spurious noise sources at 280 mJy per beam.\nThis limit is around five time the nominal 1-\u03c3 noise level\nand gives a lower mass limit of around 13 M\u2299 , depending\non temperature assumptions. Analysis of the distribution of\nmasses in the sample shows that adopting a single temperature for all clumps produces a somewhat different result\nfrom using a distribution of temperatures based on NH3 gas\ntemperatures.\nThe mass function is flatter than found in many other\nstudies and is not a simple, single power law but contains\nsignificant structure. Simple modelling indicates that this\nstructure can be explained by crowding of sources near or\nbelow the spatial resolution of the data. Whether the implied\ncharacteristic scale (\u223c 0.1 pc) of this crowding is meaningful\nis not yet clear, but it is similar to the thermal Jeans length\nof just-resolved objects at the low-mass end of the sample.\nThe W 3 GMC is subject to feedback from a previous\ngeneration of OB stars, having been compressed on one side\nby the expansion of the Hii region generated by the W 4 OB\n\n\f12\n\nT. J. T. Moore, et al.\n\nassociation, while the rest of the cloud is largely unaffected.\nThe W 3 cloud therefore provides a useful insight into the\nprocesses of triggered star formation and into the differences\nbetween this and spontaneous star formation.\nWe have analysed the mass distribution and mass fraction in dense clumps in the compressed region and the natural cloud. There is little evidence of any difference in the\nmass distribution, although more severe crowding in the\ncompressed cloud layer may be having an effect. The main\ndifference comes in the fraction of the cloud that has been\nconverted to dense, potentially star-forming clumps. This\nis 26 \u2013 37% in the compressed region and only 5 \u2013 13% in\nthe diffuse cloud. This difference suggests that the enhanced\nstar-formation efficiency associated with feedback and triggering is not simply a process of increasing the probability\nthat existing dense clumps will collapse to form stars (e.g. by\nincreasing the ambient pressure). It is consistent with new\nstructure being created in the compressed shocked gas and\nalso supports a model in which structures in the pre-shocked\ngas survive but accrete more efficiently in the post-shock environment.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe James Clerk Maxwell Telescope is operated by The\nJoint Astronomy Centre on behalf of the Particle Physics\nand Astronomy Research Council of the United Kingdom,\nthe Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research, and\nthe National Research Council of Canada.
