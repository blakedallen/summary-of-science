We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for three paradigmatic disordered\nsystems: molecular C60 , a-Si, and a-SiO2 . Much improved atomistic models are attained in each\ncase without any a-priori assumptions regarding coordination number or local geometry. We propose\nthat this approach may form the basis for a generalised methodology for structure \"solution\" from\nPDF data applicable to network, nanostructured and molecular systems alike.\nPACS numbers: 61.43.-j, 61.46.-w, 02.70.Rr, 81.07.Nb\n\nMany materials of fundamental importance possess\nstructures that do not exhibit long-range periodicity: examples include metallic and covalent glasses [1], amorphous biominerals [2], the so-called \"phase-change\"\nchalcogenides of DVD-RAM technology [3], and amorphous semiconductors such as a-Si and a-Ge [4]. The\nabsence of Bragg reflections in the diffraction patterns\nof these materials precludes the use of traditional crystallographic techniques as a means of determining their\natomic-scale structures. Yet it is clear that these materials do possess well-defined local structure on the nanometre scale [5]; moreover it is often this local structure that\nis implicated in the particular physical properties of interest [6]. For this reason, the development of systematic\ninformation-based methodologies for the determination\nof local structure in disordered materials remains one of\nthe key challenges in modern structural science [7].\nHistorically, local structure has been studied experimentally using two principal approaches: (i) the diffraction techniques of neutron and x-ray total scattering,\nfrom which the distribution of interatomic separations\ncan be measured via the pair distribution function (PDF)\n[8], and (ii) resonance and spectroscopic methods (NMR,\nEXAFS, IR, Raman) that yield information concerning the number and population of distinct atomic environments, together with (in favourable cases) metalcoordination/molecular geometries [9, 10]. These techniques afford a rich body of information, and over the\npast 5\u201310 years a number of sophisticated methods of\nanalysis have emerged that aim to derive structural models via fitting to these experimental data. The Reverse\nMonte Carlo (RMC) [11] and Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) [12] methods have been used\nwidely in the glass and amorphous materials community,\nwhile the PDFfit [13] and \"Liga\" [14] methods have been\napplied more recently to nanostructured solids such as\nC60 [7] and ferrihydrite [15]-systems that present simi-\n\nlar crystallographic challenges.\nThere is, however, a fundamental problem: markedly\ndifferent structural models can be equally consistent with\nthe same PDF data [16]. Moreover, the task of fitting simultaneously to PDF and spectroscopic data is almost\nalways either too computationally demanding or in fact\nnot quantitatively possible. Taken together, these factors have meant that it is often difficult to determine the\natomic-level structure of these materials, and that there\nis no \"routine\" information-based approach analogous to\nthose for crystalline materials.\nIn this Letter, we show that this problem can\nlargely be solved by using information gained via\nspectroscopy-the number and population of distinct\natomic environments-to guide refinement of experimental PDF data. Structural refinement based on reproducing the experimental PDF alone is, in general, not\nsufficiently well-constrained to produce models that reflect the \"true\" local structure in a material; however,\nif refinement is forced also to reflect the correct number\nand distribution of atom environments then convergence\non the correct local structure usually follows. This approach is easily implemented and generic. Moreover, we\nshow that successful refinement can be initiated using\nentirely random atomistic models and, in being driven\nwholly by experimental data, one avoids any other apriori assumptions concerning e.g. coordination numbers\nor geometries. While our focus lies on proof-of-principle\nat this stage, our results show that routine informationbased structure determination of disordered materials is\nnow a viable prospect.\nOur paper is arranged as follows. We begin by describing the particular implementation of our methodology through a \"variance\"-based term in the cost function used to drive PDF refinement. Three principal case\nstudies follow: nanoparticulate C60 (single cluster; one\natom environment), amorphous silicon (continuous net-\n\n\f2\nwork solid; one atom environment) and amorphous silica\n(continuous network solid; two atom environments). In\nall three instances we show that a conventional RMC\napproach fails to obtain the correct structure solution-\noften spectacularly-but that inclusion of the variance\nterm is sufficient to recover almost-perfect models of material structure in each case. We conclude by discussing a\nnumber of different possible implementations of our underlying methodology.\nIn outlining our methodology, it is useful to consider\nfirst the simplest type of disordered material: namely a\nphase that contains a single atom type and for which\nspectroscopy indicates a single atom environment. The\nexistence of a single atomic environment demands that\nstructural correlation functions calculated for different\nindividual atoms within the material should take similar\nforms. In order to recast this statement with specific reference to the PDF, we first define atomic PDFs pj (r) for\nan atomistic model such that the \"bulk\" (measurable)\nPDF G(r) corresponds to the average hp(r)i taken over\nall atoms j. Then the existence of a single atom environment dictates a similarity pj (r) \u223c pj 0 (r) \u223c G(r) for\nall atoms j, j 0 . Whereas a standard PDF-based structure refinement would involve minimising a function of\nthe form\n\u03c72 =\n\nX\n\n[hp(r)i \u2212 Gexpt (r)]2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nr\n\nwhat we would propose is the alternative cost function\n\n\u03c72 =\n\n1 XX\n[pj (r) \u2212 Gexpt (r)]2 .\nN j r\n\n(2)\n\nNote that in this reformulation one obtains \u03c72 = 0 if\nand only if the model PDF matches Gexpt (r) and each\nindividual pj (r) has the same form. It is straightforward\nto show that the new penalty function \u03c72 of (2) is in\nfact equal to that of (1) plus a variance term \u03c72Var =\nhp(r)2 i \u2212 hp(r)i2 . What the spectroscopic result suggests\nis to add to a conventional PDF refinement a term that\npenalises variance in local coordination environments; for\nthis reason we are terming our approach an INVariant\nEnvironment Refinement Technique (INVERT).\nIn practice, the individual pj (r) for a static atomistic\nmodel consist of a series of delta functions, and in order\nto obtain a well-behaved variance term, it is necessary to\nadopt a modified formulation such as:\n\n\u03c72Var =\n\n2\n1 X X [dj (i) \u2212 hd(i)i]\n,\nN j i\nhd(i)i2\n\nFIG. 1: RMC refinement of the experimental PDF of C60 : (a)\nthe neutron PDF itself, corrected to remove inter-molecular\ncorrelations as described in Ref. 14; (b) a random starting\nconfiguration of 60 carbon atoms; (c) a typical configuration produced by conventional RMC refinement of either idealised or experimental PDF data; and those produced by INVERT+RMC using (d) idealised, and (e) experimental PDF\ndata. In panels (b)\u2013(e), atoms with three nearest neighbours\nare coloured blue and others are coloured red.\n\n(3)\n\nwhere dj (i) measures the distance from atom j to its i-th\nneighbour, and hd(i)i is the average such distance over\n\nall atoms j. The term in the denominator of Eq. (3) appears in order to account for the fact that the number of\nneighbours at a distance d scales with d2 [17]. The extension to multiple atom types and/or atom environments\nis straightforward. A separate variance term is included\nfor each different pair of atom types (A and B, say); the\nform of each individual term is the same as in Eq. (3)\nexcept that the dj (i) will refer to i-th neighbour of type\nB around the j-th atom of type A, and so on.\nAt this point we emphasise that no assumption has\nbeen made regarding the actual distribution of neighbours around each atom-only that this distribution\nshould be similar for equivalent atoms. Moreover, we are\nable to constrain the partial PDF functions for multicomponent systems despite the experimental PDF data\nrepresenting a sum over these separate contributions.\nWe have chosen C60 as a simple first case study,\nnot least because the task of determining its wellknown icosahedral structure from the experimental PDF\n[Fig. 1(a)] has recently been highlighted as a benchmark challenge in nanostructure determination [14]. As\nstraightforward as the task might seem, conventional\nRMC refinement from a random starting configuration\n[Fig. 1(b)] fails entirely, giving a set of small clusters\nthat contains only a few of the real set of interatomic\nseparations [Fig. 1(c)]. The same result is obtained even\nif idealised PDF data are used.\nThe INVERT modification exploits the experimental\n\n\f3\nNMR result that C60 contains a single C environment\n[18]. Clearly the RMC configuration in Fig. 1(c) violates this property, and so would now give rise to a large\n\u03c72Var term that will help drive refinement forward. Indeed, INVERT+RMC refinement from the same random\nstarting configuration gives the correct solution for idealised data [Fig. 1(d)] and a near-perfect solution for the\nexperimental neutron PDF data of Ref. 14 [Fig. 1(e)]. We\nnote that such a result has only ever been achieved previously using the highly-sophisticated cluster optimisation\nmethods of the \"Liga\" algorithm or using genetic algorithms based on the principle of mating or crossover (the\nlatter only giving correct solutions in 56 % of attempts)\n[7, 19, 20]. Here, INVERT+RMC consistently obtains a\ntopologically-identical solution from random starting coordinates in approximately 2 000\u20134 000 accepted moves.\nWe find the extension to a cluster with two atom\nenvironments-namely, S12 [21]-enjoys similar success\n[22]. Videos that illustrate the refinement process for\nC60 and S12 are provided as supporting information [23].\nThe paradigmatic \"stumbling block\" for RMC, however, has always been amorphous Si, whose structure\nis believed to consist of a continuous random network\n(CRN) of tetrahedral Si centres [24]. Rather than generating a network of four-fold-coordinated Si atoms, RMC\nrefinements of a-Si PDF data yield configurations with\nunphysically-broad distributions of Si coordination numbers [16]. This is allowed because, crudely speaking, a\npair of atoms of coordination numbers three and five will\ncontribute to the average PDF indistinguishably from\ntwo four-fold coordinated atoms, and yet the former state\nis statistically more likely during a sequence of random\nmoves. Various work-arounds have been proposed and\nimplemented (e.g. constraining coordination numbers to\nequal four), and in the most favourable of cases these\nyield CRNs comparable to those obtained from bondswitching (Wooten-Weaire-Winer, \"WWW\" [25]) methods, molecular dynamics and ab-initio calculations [24].\nHowever, there is a sense in which one recovers from\nthese approaches only the very information already used\nto generate the constraints: if the coordination number\nis constrained to equal four during refinement, then fourfold coordination cannot be considered an independent\nresult. Consequently, our motivation for considering aSi as a second case study was primarily to determine\nwhether, by using the evidence for a single Si environment from NMR studies [26], INVERT+RMC refinement\ncould yield reasonable structural models without recourse\nto explicit coordination number constraints.\nFirst, a conventional RMC refinement was performed\nusing G(r) \"data\" generated from the trusted WWW\nmodel of Ref. 25. The starting configuration was a\nrandom collection of 512 Si atoms in a cubic box of\nside 21.7 \u00c5. Refinement gave a highly-disordered configuration that displayed all the hallmarks of previouslydescribed problematic RMC studies [16]: only 27 % of\n\nFIG. 2: Comparison of a-Si configurations obtained using\n(left) \"Native RMC\" and (centre) \"INVERT+RMC\"' refinement with (right) the trusted \"WWW\"model of Ref. 25. (a)\nSlices of the configurations themselves, with four-coordinate\nSi coloured blue and others coloured red. (b) The PDFs calculated from each configuration, which are essentially identical.\n(c) Corresponding PDF variances calculated using Eq. (3).\n\nSi atoms are four-fold coordinated, there are substantial\ndensity variations, and large numbers of unphysical Si3\n\"triangles\" [left-hand panel of Fig. 2(a)]. In contrast, a\nparallel INVERT+RMC refinement achieved an almost\nperfect coordination distribution (95 % four-fold). The\nimprovement extended even to the higher-order correlations (discussed in more detail below): in particular,\nthe number of Si3 triangles is halved, and the density\ndistribution is much more even. Inspection of the configuration itself [centre panel of Fig. 2(a)] now reveals obvious similarities to the trusted WWW model [right-hand\npanel of Fig. 2(a)]. The PDF itself is relatively insensitive to this fundamental improvement in local structure\nmodelling [Fig. 2(b)], while the variance term of Eq. (3)\nclearly acts a much better figure-of-merit [Fig. 2(c)].\nSimilar results are obtained for amorphous SiO2 , which\nis a conceptual extension in that it contains two distinct\natom environments: that of the Si atoms and that of the\nO atoms. Experimental neutron PDF data were taken\nfrom Ref. 27, and starting configurations generated from\na random distribution of 64 Si atoms and 128 O atoms\n\n\f4\nto A.L.G. and M.J.C., and from the US NSF to D.A.D.\nunder grant DMR 09-03225.

Keen\n(Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) for useful discussions,\nand acknowledge the University of Cambridge's CamGrid\ninfrastructure for computational resources.\n\nFIG. 3: A slice of the information-driven CRN model of aSiO2 obtained using INVERT+RMC refinement as described\nin the text. Si and O atoms shown in dark and light colours,\nrespectively; atoms in shades of blue have the expected coordination numbers of 4 (Si) and 2 (O), while the few in shades\nof red have incorrect coordination numbers.\n\nin a periodic cubic box of side 14.37 \u00c5. RMC refinement\nboth with and without the INVERT modification gave\nexcellent fits to the PDF, but the INVERT+RMC model\nhad a much higher percentage of fourfold Si coordination\n(97% vs. 59% for the RMC-only configuration). Indeed,\nwe believe the INVERT+RMC configuration to be the\nfirst information-based CRN model of a-SiO2 [Fig. 3].\nThe INVERT methodology is by no means applicable\nonly to RMC refinement. Our focus on RMC in this\nLetter arises from a desire to demonstrate the effectiveness of the INVERT approach using a refinement method\nthat is known to favour disorder. The incorporation of\nvariance-based cost functions in any refinement approach\nis straightforward, and such a modification to more sophisticated PDF fitting approaches than RMC, e.g. as\nsuggested in Ref. 14, might reasonably be expected to\nproduce even more realistic configurations.\nSpeaking more generally, we would note that the concept of local invariance encompasses more than minimising the PDF variance alone. One can imagine, for example, that minimising the variance in higher-order correlation functions, such as angle distributions, coordination\ngeometry, and CRN ring statistics might also improve refinement further. Importantly, these constraints can be\nimplemented despite the functions not being measurable\nexperimentally. In practice, however, we have found that\nthe calculation of higher-order correlation functions is too\ncomputationally-demanding for speedy refinement at this\nstage; the extension to constraining geometric invariance\nusing spherical harmonics and/or the triplet distribution\nfunction is an approach we hope to pursue further in the\nnear future.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge financial support from Trinity College, Cambridge to A.L.G., from the EPSRC (UK)\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: andrew.goodwin@chem.ox.ac.uk\n[1] C.

We focus here on the\nmodification given in Eq. (3) because it is easily implemented and remains a good measure of the variance.\n[18] R. D. Johnson, G. Meijer, D. S. Bethune J. Am.

PDF refinements started from a\nrandom arrangement of 6 \"SA \" and 6 \"SB \" atoms, and\nthe variance contribution taken to equal the sum of the\nfour partial variance terms (SA \u2013SA , SA \u2013SB , SB \u2013SA , SB \u2013\nSB ). The correct molecular structure was consistently attained within 1 000\u20132 000 accepted moves; RMC refinements without the INVERT modification gave unphysical\nclusters not dissimilar in form to those obtained for C60 .\n[23] See EPAPS Document Nos.
