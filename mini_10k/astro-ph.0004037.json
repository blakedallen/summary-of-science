This population makes itself apparent\nby microlensing high redshift quasars and introducing pronounced variability into their observed\nlight curves. While several arguments dismissing this hypothesis have been presented, a conclusive\nobservational test is, alas, sadly lacking. In this paper we investigate the effect of a cosmologically\ndistributed population of microlensing masses on galaxies at low to intermediate redshift. The\nmagnification of bright stars in these galaxies leads to small, but observable, fluctuations in their\nsurface brightness. The variability time scale for Jupiter-mass lensing objects is of the order\nof a few months and this population may be detected through a future space-based monitoring\ncampaign of a field containing z \u223c 0.5 galaxies. The monitoring of galactic surface brightness\nwill provide an effective test of the nature of dark matter on cosmological scales.\nSubject headings: Microlensing: Dark Matter: Black Holes: Galaxies\n\n1.\n\nOne recent suggestion proposes that the variability seen in high redshift quasars, rather than\nbeing intrinsic to the source, is due to the microlensing action of Jupiter mass black holes distributed cosmologically along the line-of-sight to\nthe quasar (Hawkins 1993, 1996). To account\nfor the characteristics of the variability, a substantial population of black holes is required,\nwith a density high enough to account for a significant fraction of the total mass in the universe (Schneider 1993). While there is theoretical support for such a model, with models\nof the quark-hadron transition producing black\nholes with a mass of \u223c 10\u22123 M\u2299 [e.g. Hawkins\n& Taylor (1997)], observations have failed to reveal their presence in studies of the equivalent\nwidths of distant quasars (Canizares 1982; Dalcanton et al. 1994), although this conclusion has\nbeen contested (Hawkins 1996). Other objections\nto this microlensing hypothesis have been raised\n(Baganoff & Malkan 1995; Alexander 1995), with\ncorresponding rebuttals (Hawkins & Taylor 1997).\nMore recently, arguments have become quite vitriolic with the suggestion that this idea of cosmologically distributed black holes is being ignored by\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nature of dark matter is one of the major outstanding problems in current astrophysics,\nwith the community being divided between two\nbroad camps: those who propose particle dark\nmatter and those who support massive compact\nobjects. Both these ideas have received recent\nimpetus due to the measurement of a neutrino\nmass (Fukuda et al. 1998) and the detection of\nMACHOs in the halo of our Galaxy (Alcock et\nal. 1993), although the small mass of the neutrino\nand the uncertainty in the location of the MACHO\nlenses suggests that the nature of majority of the\ndark matter still remains hidden from us.\n1 Astronomy Dept., University of Washington,\nSeattle WA, U.S.A. &\nDept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Victoria,\nVictoria, B.C., Canada\nElectronic mail: gfl@astro.washington.edu\nElectronic mail: gfl@uvastro.phys.uvic.ca\n2 Present Address: Anglo-Australian Observatory,\nPO Box 296, Epping, NSW 1710, Australia\nElectronic mail: gfl@aaoepp.aao.gov.au\n3 Max-Plank Institut fuer Astronomie, Koenigstuhl 17,\nD-69117 Heidelberg, Germany\nElectronic mail: ribata@mpia-hd.mpg.de\n\n1\n\n\fthe astronomical community even though the apparent evidence is overwhelming (Hawkins 1998).\nThe microlensing of cosmological supernovae\nprovides a potential probe of any population of\nblack holes (Schneider & Wagoner 1987; Rauch\n1991,a; Metcalf & Silk 1999), although their rarity\nsuggests that a long observational period may be\nrequired until an unambiguous detection is made.\nIn this paper we provide a complementary probe of\na cosmologically distributed black hole population;\ninstead of supernovae as the source population, we\nfocus here on microlensing on the much more numerous population of normal stars in galaxies out\nto z \u223c 0.5. In Section 2 we outline the analytic\nand numerical approach to this problem, while in\nSection 3 the results of a suite of simulations are\npresented. Section 4 is concerned with the time\nscale of the microlensing variability, and the observational feasibility of this study is discussed in\nSection 5. Section 7 presents the overall conclusions of this study.\n2.\n2.1.\n\ndepth these would add in our view to M31 would,\ndue to the small distance and hence low density\nof material, be negligible. Focusing instead out to\nintermediate redshift, however, the optical depth\nbecomes more substantial (this is demonstrated\nbelow) and a number of microlenses will lie along\nour line-of-sight to a distant galaxy. In such a\nregime a fraction of the population of stars in a\npixel will be subject to strong magnification. As\nthe intrinsic motions of the microlensing objects\nchange their positions with respect to the lineof-sight, the 'state' of the microlensing (i.e. how\nmuch each star is magnified) will also change, resulting in a fluctuation in the apparent luminosity\nof a patch of stars. The details of these fluctuations depends on several factors, including the\noptical depth to microlensing and the luminosity\nfunction of stars in the source galaxy; these are\nexplored in more detail below.\n2.2.\n\nCosmological Considerations\n\nStandard cosmological models assume that all\nmaterial in the universe is smoothly and homogeneously distributed. In the following argument,\nhowever, all the matter in the universe is condensed in to compact objects. To begin with, it\nis assumed that these objects do not influence our\nline-of-sight view to a distant source. Dyer and\nRoeder (1972;1973;1974) considered the propagation of light through such an \"empty beam\" universe and found that the convergence, or focusing,\nof the beam is removed due to the lack of material\nand that objects at a particular redshift appear\nfainter than those observed in a universe where\nthe matter is smoothly distributed, even the universal curvature is the same in both cases 4 . For\nthe purposes of this paper, we seek an intermediate position, with matter in the form of compact\nobjects distributed randomly in the universe, with\nno constraint on their location with respect to our\nline-of-sight to a distant source. With this, the microlensing masses can influence the beam and, in\nthe mean, the appearance of distant objects must\nbe identical to that of a universe where all the\nmatter is smoothly distributed (Weinberg 1976).\nWith respect to the empty-beam universe model,\nthe influence of the lensing masses is to magnify\n\nMethod\nBackground\n\nMicrolensing surveys of the Galactic halo focus\nupon identifying brightness fluctuations of a single, isolated source by an individual star or binary\nsystem along the line-of-sight (Paczynski 1986). It\nis not necessary, however, to identify single stars in\na search for microlensing. Proposing to search for\nMACHOs in the halo of M31, Crotts (1992) noted\nthat while the light registered in a single pixel is\na combination of the entire stellar population, the\nmajority of it arises in a relatively small number of\nextremely luminous giants. In a stochastic manner\na massive object in the halo of M31 will traverse\nthe line-of-sight to a giant and induce a strong\nmicrolensing magnification, increasing the surface\nbrightness of the entire pixel. A monitoring program of this 'pixel lensing' has recently come to\nfruition with the identification of several potential microlensing events (Crotts & Tomaney 1996;\nTomaney & Crotts 1996; Alcock et al. 1999).\nGiven the relative lens geometry, however,\nthe optical depth for such lensing is very small\n(10\u22126 \u2192 10\u22125 ), and events are extremely rare.\nSimilarly, if all dark matter is in the form\nof MACHO-like objects distributed uniformly\nthrough-out the universe, the additional optical\n\n4 An\n\nexcellent description of cosmological distances is given\nby Schneider, Ehlers & Falco (1992)\n\n2\n\n\fthe distant sources by a factor\n\u00152\n\u0014\nr1 (z)\n,\nh\u03bcth i(z) =\nr(z)\n\nis dominated by bright pairs of images and can\nbe treated analytically [e.g. Schneider & Weiss\n(1988)]. At lower magnifications, however, the\nform of the magnification distribution function is\nstrongly dependent upon the optical depth to microlensing, displaying complex secondary features\ndue to higher order caustics (Rauch, Mao, Wambsganss & Paczynski 1992; Wambsganss 1992; Lewis\n& Irwin 1995); no analytic treatment fully characterizing these low magnification features has\nbeen presented [although recent semi-analytical\nattempts have proved promising e.g. Kofman et\nal. (1997) & Lee et al. (1997)].\nFor the case of a single, isolated microlens mass\nthe probability distribution of magnifications can\nbe derived analytically (Schneider, Ehlers & Falco\n1992) and is given by\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r(z) is the normalized angular diameter distance to a source at redshift z in a universe with\na smooth distribution of matter, and r1 (z) is the\nequivalent distance in a universe with the same\nglobal value of \u03a9, but with all the matter in the\nform of compact objects that do not influence the\nline-of-sight view to distant objects. These angular diameter distances are normalized such that\nD(z) = (c/Ho )r(z).\nWhile the smooth matter case is analytically\ntractable, the solution of r1 (z) typically requires\nthe numerical solution of a differential equation\n(Dyer & Roeder 1972; 1973; 1974). In the following, however, we will assume that \u03a9 = 1 and that\nall the matter is in the form of substellar compact objects. With these assumptions (Paczynski\n& Wambsganss 1989);\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3 + z 2 + 2 1 + z + z(3 + 1 + z)\nr1 (z)\n=\n.

It is assumed that, in\nthe regime relevant to this work, the microlensing optical depth is small, and the masses do not\ninfluence one another to produce complex caustic patterns. With these assumptions, the global\nmagnification probability distribution is simply related to that of the isolated lensing mass.\n\nWhile this tells us how bright objects will appear in the mean, the distribution of microlensing masses along any random line-of-sight will be\ndifferent. This introduces a scatter in the brightness distribution and, as the relative positions of\nthe microlensing masses and the source will change\ndue to random motions of the lenses and sources,\nthe magnification along any particular line-of-sight\nwill vary with time. The first task is to determine\nthe distribution of magnifications for a population\nof microlensing masses.\n2.3.\n\nd\u03bc\n(\u03bc2 \u2212 1) 2\n\n2.4.\n\nNormalization\n\nWhile Equation 3 presents the form of the magnification probability distribution, it still needs to\nbe normalized before it can employed in any analysis. This question was addressed by Linder, Wagoner & Schneider (1988) who determined that in a\nuniverse with a global density \u03a9, of which a fraction 1 \u2212 \u03b1 is in the form of compact objects distributed randomly with a constant comoving density, then\n\u0014\n\u00152\nZ zs\nr1 (z)\n(1 + z)\n3\ndz \u221a\n\u00d7\n\u03a9(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\np(\u03bc, z) =\n2\n1 + \u03a9z r1 (zs )\n0\nZ\nr(z, zs )r(zs ) \u221e\ndm \u03bd(m)ps (\u03bc, m) , (4)\nr(z)\n0\n\nMicrolensing\nMicrolensing Cross-Section\n\nTo determine the degree of microlensinginduced fluctuations on the surface brightness distribution of a distant galaxy, it is necessary to\nfirst derive the magnification (\u03bc) probability distribution for a source seen through a population\nof microlensing masses. This task is simplified\nby the fact that, irrespective of the mass spectrum of the microlenses, in the regime where \u03bc is\nlarge, p(\u03bc) \u221d \u03bc\u22123 5 . In this case, the distribution\n\nwhere \u03bd(m) is the mass spectrum of the lensing\nmasses. The last integration in this expression reflects the fact that the maximum magnification a\n\n5 Additional\n\ncaustic features do modify the magnification\nprobability distribution in this region, although these fea-\n\ntures are negligible at the optical depths considered in this\npaper, a point we return to later.\n\n3\n\n\fsource can undergo is related to its physical size,\nthe mass of the lensing objects and the lensing geometry (Chang & Refsdal 1979). Here, r(z1 , z2 )\nis the normalized angular diameter distance between two redshifts. For the gravitational lensing\nconfigurations presented in this paper, assuming a\nmicrolensing mass of 10\u22123 M\u2299 and considering\u221athe\nanalysis of Chang (1984), \u03bcmax \u223c 100 \u2192 200/ R,\nwhere R is the radius of the source star in Solar radii. The most luminous B and A stars have\nR \u223c 10R\u2299 , for which \u03bcmax \u223c 30 \u2192 60, while\nthe stars contributing the majority of the populations luminosity possess R \u223c 1 \u2192 10R\u2299 . This\nupper limit of the magnification cuts off the probability distribution function, slightly enhancing the\ndistribution below \u03bcmax [e.g. Figure 4 of Lewis\nand Irwin (1995)]. As significant magnification of\nstars can occur, we chose, therefore, not to restrict the probability distribution function. With\nthis, Equation 3 is independent of the microlensing mass function, \u03bd(m) can be replaced with an\narbitrary \u03b4 function and Equation 4 can be used\nto derive a normalization, k, of the magnification\nprobability distribution.\nWhile Equation 4 provides a normalization, the\nmagnification probability distribution as described\nby Equation 3 diverges as \u03bc \u2192 1; this is because in determining Equation 3 it is assumed\nthat the lensing mass lies within an infinite plane,\nwith which any finite impact parameter results in\n\u03bc > 1. An infinite impact parameter is required\nfor \u03bc = 1. As we are limited to a finite amount\nof sky we require that p(\u03bc) \u2192 0 as \u03bc \u2192 1. We\nchoose, therefore, to modify Equation 3 with a\nfunction to remove the divergence at \u03bc = 1. The\nform employed is\np(\u03bc) = (1 \u2212 e\u03bcw (1\u2212\u03bc) )2\n\nk\n(\u03bc2\n\n3\n\n\u2212 1) 2\n\n,\n\nHowever, as Equation 4 normalizes the asymptotic\nform of the probability distribution, the single free\nparameter in Equation 5, namely \u03bcw , can be fixed\nwith one of these equations, while the other can\nbe employed to ensure consistency.\nThe procedure employed in this paper is to use\nEquation 6 to determine \u03bcw . A series of these\nprobability distributions, for source redshifts of\nz = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 & 0.5, with \u03a9 = 1 all in the\nform of compact objects, are presented in Figure 1,\nwhile Figure 2 presents k and \u03bcw over the redshift\nrange z = 0.05 \u2192 0.5. All of the magnification\nprobability distributions possess a sharp peak near\n\u03bc = 1, coupled with an asymptotic p(\u03bc) \u221d \u03bc\u22123\ntail at high magnifications. These normalized distributions were then used to determine h\u03bci. This\nmean magnification is compared to the theoretically expected value (Equations 1 & 2) in Figure 3;\nthere is an excellent agreement between the two\napproaches. This is due to the low optical depth\n(and hence simple) regime in which the analysis is\nundertaken, as at higher stellar densities, such as\nthose responsible for the microlensing of multiply\nimaged quasars, individual stars no longer behave\nlike isolated lenses and their combined effects can\nlead to extremely complex magnification patterns\non a high redshift source (Wambsganss, Paczynski\n& Katz 1990).\nConsidering the theoretically expected magnification it is simple to determine that the optical depth to microlensing out to the redshift of\ninterest. This ranges from \u03ba\u2217 \u223c 0.002 at z =\n0.1 to \u03ba\u2217 \u223c 0.04 at z = 0.5. These numbers\nare several orders of magnitude greater than the\n\u03ba\u2217 \u223c 10\u22126 \u2192 10\u22125 expected of gravitational microlensing in the Galactic halo and towards M31\n[c.f. (Paczynski 1986)], and hence, in this extragalactic scenario, microlensing effects should be\nmore apparent. While these arguments demonstrate the efficacy of microlensing, deriving the\ndetailed behavior requires knowledge of the underlying stellar luminosity function as the number\ndensity of potential sources will dictate the level\nof observed fluctuations in the stellar sample as a\nwhole, a topic which we turn to in the next section.\nHow does Equation 5 compare to previous studies of the magnification probability distribution of\nmicrolenses distributed in three dimensions? The\nnumerical studies undertaken by Rauch (1991;a)\nfocus on substantially higher optical depths than\n\n(5)\n\nwhere both the values \u03bcw and k are functions of\nredshift. This Equation is subject to two constraints, the first being the usual normalization\nof the probability distribution function, and the\nsecond being flux conservation between full and\nempty beam universes (Equation 1):\nZ \u221e\np(\u03bc) d\u03bc = 1\n(6)\nZ1 \u221e\n\u03bc p(\u03bc) d\u03bc = h\u03bcth i .\n(7)\n1\n\n4\n\n\fthose considered in this paper, although one case,\nwith \u03ba\u2217 = 0.01 [Figure 2 in Rauch (1991)], can\nbe compared to distribution presented in Figure 1\nfor z = 0.2 (\u03ba\u2217 = 0.008). An excellent correspondence between the two distributions can be\nseen over the entire magnification range. Kofman\net al. (1997) and Lee et al. (1997) analytically\ntackled the form of the magnification probability\ndistribution for both 2-D and 3-D distributions of\nmicrolensing masses. Also considering the numerical simulations of Rauch (1991;a) and Rauch et\nal. (1992), these papers investigate the nature\nof the higher order caustic features identified in\nthe magnification probability distribution at large\nmagnifications, features which are not accounted\nfor in Equation 5. While substantially influencing\nthe form of the 2-D distributions, these features\nwere found to be very small for the corresponding\n3-D distributions. The analysis of Kofman et al.\n(1997) and Lee et al. (1997) was not considered at\nthe optical depths presented in this paper, but for\n\u03ba\u2217 = 0.1 the caustic features induce a deviation\nof only \u223c 15% at \u03bc \u223c 30, where the distribution\nhas fallen to 10\u22126 that of its peak value. At the\noptical depths considered in this paper, such deviations will be even more inconsequential, and can\nbe ignored. Lee et al. (1997) comment on difficulty in determining the form of the magnification\nprobability distribution at low magnifications, especially in the case where the microlensing masses\nare distributed in three dimensions. Comparing\nFigure 6 of Kofman et al. (1997) with Figure 13\nof Lee et al. (1997), it can be seen that at small\nmagnifications (log10 (\u03bc) < 0.1) that the probability distributions for the 2-D and 3-D case are\nvery similar. In this regime, Kofman et al. (1997)\nprovide a semi-analytic formalism which approximates the form of the distribution. Comparing\nthis to Equation 5 for the z = 0.5, \u03ba\u2217 = 0.04 case\npresented in this paper, a maximum difference of\n\u223c 7% at log10 (\u03bc) \u223c 0.005. Hence Equation 5 has\nan excellent correspondence with previous results.\n2.5.\n\ngree, and examining Figure 1, most stars will suffer\na magnification \u03bc \u223c 1, although a fraction of the\npopulation will be magnified by a much more substantial factor. On average, however, the overall\nflux in a pixel will be magnified by h\u03bcth i, although\nat any instant the brightness of a pixel will depend on the relative positions of the microlenses,\nas this dictates how much each star in the pixel is\nmagnified. These will change due to the intrinsic\nvelocity dispersion of the microlensing bodies, resulting in fluctuations in the observed flux within a\npixel about this mean value. To be a useful probe\nof the intervening matter, however, these fluctuations must exceed some observable threshold. To\nproperly determine this, the luminosity function\nof the source stellar population needs to be considered.\nIf the luminosity function is comprised of only\nrelatively low luminosity stars then a large number is required to account for total flux detected\nin a pixel. When such a population is microlensed\nmany stars will be in a highly magnified state.\nAs the microlensing state changes, and the magnification of each star also changes, the absolute\nnumber of stars in the highly magnified state remains essentially constant. Even if a single star is\nextremely magnified, a very rare occurrence, then\nthe contribution this star makes to the flux registered in a pixel is small compared to the overwhelming background of the numerous stars which\nare only moderately magnified. Conversely, if the\nluminosity function consists of only very luminous\nstars then only a small number are required to\naccount for the luminosity in a pixel. It is very\nunlikely that any individual star is strongly magnified. When this rare event does occur, however,\nthe contribution from the magnified star can dominate the flux received in a pixel, resulting in a substantial fluctuation in the observed surface brightness. The real situation, however, is a combination\nof the above and we expect that a stellar population sampled in a pixel consists of a large proportion of faint stars which are insensitive to the\neffects of microlensing, resulting in a background\nflux, and a relatively small number of very luminous stars which dominate the luminosity.\nThe luminosity function model we choose is the\nstellar LF from Jahreiss and Wielen (1997), derived\nfrom Hipparchos data within 20 pc of the Sun.\nThe characteristics of this luminosity function are\n\nStellar Luminosity Function\n\nWith current instrumentation, the angular diameter of galaxies at redshifts of z \u223c 0.5 ensures\nthat they will extend over only a small number of\npixels, and the light recorded in each pixel is the\nsum of the flux from a large number of stars. Each\nstar in the pixel will be microlensed by some de5\n\n\fpresented in Figure 4; representing a population\nwith a total luminosity of 106 L\u2299 , the solid line\nshows the number of stars possessing a luminosity\ngreater than some value, while the dot-dashed line\nis their contribution to the total luminosity of the\npixel. It is obvious from this picture that while\nstars with L > 10 L\u2299 represent less than 1% of\nthe population by number, they account for 70%\nof the total luminosity.\n3.\n\nArmed with this information it is now possible to tackle the question of the overall brightness fluctuations expected for a population of stars\ndrawn from a luminosity function, and hence the\nexpected surface brightness fluctuation within a\npixel. For this, the above magnification distributions are convolved with the stellar luminosity\nfunction described in Section 2.5, assuming a total\nluminosity, and hence number of stars in the population. Again, a Monte Carlo approach is taken\nand the luminosity function is binned logarithmically. While the bins at lower luminosity contain\nmany stars they contribute a negligible fraction of\nthe total luminosity and are uniformly magnified\nby h\u03bci. At the high luminosity end, where the luminosity contributions of the bins become a more\nappreciable fraction of the total luminosity, magnification probability distribution for each bin is calculated by combining the appropriate population\nmagnification probability distributions presented\nin Figure 5. The distribution for each bin is then\ncombined, weighted by the luminosity fraction of\nthe bin, to determine the magnification probability distribution for the entire population of stars.\nTwo constraints, that the mean value of the final\ndistribution must be h\u03bci and that the integrated\narea under the resultant probability distribution\nmust be unity, are checked to ensure consistency.\nFigure 6 presents the results of this procedure for\na range of source redshifts between z = 0.05 and\nz = 0.5, displaying the percentage variability for\nstellar populations of 105 L\u2299 (dark grey), 106 L\u2299\n(medium grey) and 107 L\u2299 (light grey) total luminosity. Table 1 presents the integral properties of\nthese distributions with each column representing\nthe range within which 10, 30, 50, 70 & 90% of\nthe magnifications of the population lie, relative\nto the average magnification. A number of interesting features are immediately apparent; at low\nredshift the relatively small microlensing optical\ndepth induces negligible fluctuations into the observed total brightness of any of the populations.\nThis changes as the redshift, and hence the microlensing optical depth, is increased, until by redshift z = 0.5 microlensing will introduce fluctuations of order \u223c 1% into a sample with a total\nluminosity of 105 L\u2299 . Increasing the luminosity of\nthe stellar sample, however, reduces the width of\nthe distribution, as expected from the central limit\ntheorem, such that a population of 107 at z = 0.5\n\nMagnification Distributions\n\nGiven a population of microlensing masses, the\nmagnification of a single star can be chosen by selecting from the magnification probability distribution given by Equation 5. For a sample of stars,\nmagnifications can be drawn from this distribution\nmultiple times to determine the total magnification of the population. While this is straight forward, it becomes computationally expensive when\nthe population consists of a very large number\nstars. The procedure employed in this study is\nto determine the magnification statistics for various numbers of source stars, combining the results\nto reproduce the effect of microlensing the entire\nsource stellar population. Analytically this can be\ncalculated by convolving the magnification probability distribution for a single star (Equation 5)\nwith itself nsamp times, where nsamp is the number of stars being microlensed. Again, while this\nis simple for a small population of source stars,\nthe calculation becomes numerically unwieldy for\na large number of stars. For the purpose of this paper, these statistics were generated a Monte Carlo\napproach, drawing nsamp observations from Equation 5 and combining them to determine the mean\nmagnification of the sample. Repeating this procedure 106 times for each nsamp it is then possible to\ndetermine the distribution of mean magnifications.\nThe results of this sampling for several source redshifts between z = 0.05 and z = 0.5 are presented\nin Figure 5, with sample sizes ranging from 1 to\n104 source stars. At all redshifts the same trend\nis seen with the distribution of the means evolving from the single realization for (Equation 5) to\na more Gaussian form as the sample size is increased; this is a consequence of the central limit\ntheorem. These distributions can then be combined to determine the distributions of means for\nany sample size.\n\n6\n\n\f<\nwill suffer fluctuations of \u223c\n0.5%. We turn to the\nobservational aspects of such small variations in\nSection 5.\n\n4.\n\nEvent Timescales\n\nWhile the magnification probability distribution is independent of the form of the underlying mass spectrum of lensing objects, the timescale of any fluctuation depends implicitly on\nthe mass of the microlenses. At the low optical depths considered here, any variability will be\nvery simple in form, consisting of the superposition of isolated peaks rather than the complex\nlight curves expected for high optical depth microlensing [e.g. Lewis, Miralda-Escude, Richardson & Wambsganss (1993)]. As with the microlensing of Magellanic Cloud sources, we can define a variability time-scale to be:\n\u0014\n\u00151\n(1 + zl ) 4GM Dls Dol 2\n\u03c4 =\nv\nc2\nDos\n\u00151\n\u0012\n\u00131 \u0014\n(1 + zl ) M 2 r(zl , zs )r(zl ) 2 \u2212 1\n\u2248 23.4\nh 2\nv1000\nM\u2299\nr(zs )\nwhere M is the microlensing mass, v1000 is the\nrelative transverse velocity in units of 1000 km s\u22121,\nand r(z1 , z2 ) is the angular diameter distance.\nFor source galaxies out to z \u223c 0.5, and considering a 10\u22123 M\u2299 microlensing mass, this time-scale\nis presented in Figure 7. The time-scale of the\nmicrolensing events are substantially less than a\nyear for all lensing configurations and hence can\nbe observed in a single observing season. When\nexamining Figure 7, it is important to remember\nthat the distribution of microlenses are volumeweighted (c.f. Equation 4), and hence are more\nlikely to be located nearer to the source redshift.\nSimilarly the typical time-scale for the microlensing events seen in the light curve of a population\nof stars will also be skewed to values less than the\nmaximum seen in Figure 7. Detailed light curves\nare beyond the scope of this current paper and\nthey will be the subject of a further study of this\nphenomenon.\n5.\n5.1.\n\nObservational Considerations\nVariability Detection\n\na cosmological population of microlensing masses,\nit is important to consider whether the amplitude\nof the expected variations are observable. Here we\nconsider monitoring many distant galaxies simultaneously with a CCD detector, with resolution\nelements that each cover a population of luminosity \u223c 107 L\u2299 . Ignoring K-corrections, this corresponds to an apparent magnitude of m = 29.0 at\nz = 0.5 (assuming q0 = 0.5 and h = 0.75). It is\nimmediately clear that such observations will normally be sky-limited, except for the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) for which the sky\nbackground is expected to be very low, and the\nspatial resolution high enough to have very small\npixels.\nTo detect 1% variations at the 3\u03c3 level, 0.33%\nrelative photometry is needed, that is, S/N = 333.\nAssuming an 8m diameter mirror, and a diffraction limited system, a count rate of \u223c 1.8Sef f photons/sec is expected from a m = 29.0 object in\nthe J-band with NGST, where Sef f is the total system efficiency. For exposure times longer\nyrs\n(8), than a few minutes, such observations will be\nphoton noise dominated, since a background of\n< 10\u22121 photons/sec/resolution element 6 is expected at 1.1\u03bcm. So the required S/N is achieved\nin 17/Sef f hrs of exposure. For a population of\nstars at a redshift of z \u223c 0.5 with a total luminosity of 107 L\u2299 , the probability of the necessary\n1% variation is 4%, so several thousand such populations need to be monitored to detect a sample\nof microlensing events. (Although deeper observations, focusing upon the fainter regions of galaxies,\nwill reveal similar scale fluctuations in \u223c 23% and\n\u223c 56% of the pixels for populations of, respectively, 106 L\u2299 and 105 L\u2299 ). Of course, in a typical field, many resolution elements on the CCD\ncamera will cover z \u223c 0.5 galaxies, and so the\nmonitoring of the populations may be achieved simultaneously. If NGST is resolution limited, each\nresolution element will cover 0.001\u2737\u2032\u2032 . For each\nresolution element to cover a 107 L\u2299 population\nat z \u223c 0.5, requires the observation of a region of\nsurface brightness 21.5mag/\u2737\u2032\u2032. In regions fainter\nthan 21.5mag/\u2737\u2032\u2032, boxes larger than a resolution\nelement can be summed up, to give a total luminosity 107 L\u2299 ; the variability of these boxes can\nalso be studied with the penalty of a small amount\n\nWhile the previous theoretical analysis has presented the framework for determining the effects of\n\n6 see\n\n7\n\nhttp://www.ngst.stsci.edu/sky/sky.html\n\n\fof extra sky noise.\nThe HDF field shows that the area in a typical 2\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032 field covered by surface brightness\n> 21.5mag/\u2737\u2032\u2032 regions of z = 0.5 galaxies exceeds several tens of \u2737\u2032\u2032 , that is, tens of thousands of NGST resolution elements. The above\ncosmological microlensing-induced variability will\nbe observed over a background of intrinsic variability events, due to supernovae, variable stars\nand galaxy self-lensing, as well as due to the inevitable Poisson noise in the observed counts. Unlike current studies of 'surface brightness fluctuations' method for distance determinations out to\ngalaxies at \u223c 100M pc (Tonry & Schneider 1988;\nThomsen, Baum, Hammergren & Worthey 1997;\nLauer, et al. 1998) which essentially requires single epoch observations, to identify microlensing\ninduced variability a monitoring program is required, allowing the identification of supernovae\nby their light-curves and peak luminosities. Supernovae are also rare, as are variable stars with a\nluminosity sufficient enough to influence the total\nluminosity of populations L \u223c 107 L\u2299 , if a survey was to focus on more luminous source pixels. As with supernovae, these would also reveal\nthemselves via their characteristic light curves. If\nthe depth of the survey is increased such that\nL \u223c 105 L\u2299 pixels are probed, the ubiquity of\ntheir variations would rule against variations in\nthe source population. In the case of self-lensing of\ngalaxy stars by MACHOs in the halo of the same\ngalaxy provides a negligible contribution as the\noptical depth is many orders of magnitude smaller\nthan that due to the cosmological microlenses considered here. The main source of detected background events is likely to be due to simple Poisson\nphoton noise. However, in the situation outlined\nabove, 3\u03c3 variations due to Poisson noise are approximately 40 times less common than the 3\u03c3 microlensing variations. Data at two epochs would\nallow an initial feasibility study. If the required\nvariability rate is indeed observed, follow-up observations at further epochs should be taken to\nmonitor the light curves of the variability events,\nto distinguish microlensing events from unlensed\nsupernova or nova events, and to reject variations\ndue to Poisson noise.\n\n5.2.\n\nExtreme Events\n\nThe previous Section has demonstrated that\nthe typical fluctuations in the brightness of a pixel\nis detectable and lends itself to future space-based\nobservatories. But are there any aspects of microlensing by a cosmologically distributed population that would make them apparent with current technology? As noted earlier in this paper,\nwhile the vast majority of stars will be magnified by a value close to the theoretically expected\nmean (Equation 1), very rarely a star will undergo an extreme magnification. The probability that a particular star is magnified by an extreme value is found by integrating the magnification probability distribution (Equation 5), which\nis presented graphically in Figure 8. For instance,\nin a 105 L\u2299 population, the LF of Figure 4 gives\n\u223c 0.1 stars with L \u223c 104 L\u2299 ; if such a star were\nto be magnified by a factor of 20, it would alter\nthe surface brightness of the population by 200%.\nAt a redshift of z = 0.05, this is an uncommon\nphenomenon, with probability P (> \u03bc) = 10\u22126 ,\nhowever, the apparent magnitude of the population is much brighter: m = 27.5, and the photometric accuracy needed to resolve these variations is S/N \u223c 3. While these are within the range\nof HST's capabilities, and many tens of fields of\n> 3 have been reimdepth of m = 27.5 with S/N \u223c\naged, it is unlikely that a sufficient area has been\ncovered to detect a sample of such rare events. So,\nwhile the tools are available, more substantial deep\nsurvey areas are required in a search for extreme\nevents with HST.\n6.\n\nOther Cosmological Models\n\nWhile throughout this paper a standard flat\ncosmology with \u03a9o = 1 has been employed, recent studies of high redshift supernovae suggest\nthe presence of a substantial cosmological constant (Garnavich, et al. 1998). To investigate\nthe influence of such a dominant cosmological\nconstant on the result presented in this paper\nthe formalism of light propagation in generalized\nFriedmann universes was employed (Linder 1988).\nThe full and empty beam distances in three universes were calculated in three cosmological models, (\u03a9o = 1, \u039bo = 0), (\u03a9o = 0.3, \u039bo = 0) and\n(\u03a90 = 0.3, \u039bo = 0.7), used to calculate the mean\nrelative magnification between the full and empty\n\n8\n\n\fbeam cases (Equation 1) and the microlensing optical depth. These are presented in Figure 9.\nOut of these three models, the case presented\nin this paper consistently displays higher optical\ndepth over the entire redshift range; this is simply\ndue to the fact that in this model more material\nlies along the line of sight to a distant source. In\ncomparison, the optical depth in the open case\nis several times smaller, reaching \u03c3 \u223c 0.15 at\nz = 0.5. The addition of a dominant cosmological constant into such a universe does not greatly\nchange the values of the optical depths. This is\nbecause, while the cosmological constant changes\nthe global curvature of the Universe, it has no influence on the Ricci focusing of the beam and locally the Universe appears as it is solely matterdominated (it is for this reason that cosmological supernovae need to be identified at redshifts\ngreater than 0.5 in an attempt to determine the\ngeometry of the Universe).\n7.\n\nquasars, the current focus for the search for cosmologically distributed microlensing masses. With\nsufficiently deep imaging with source pixel luminosities of greater than 105 L\u2299 , microlensing induced surface brightness variability can be detected over galaxies at intermediate redshifts, and\nthe ubiquitous nature of this variability means\nit will dominate over any contaminating effects,\nsuch as supernovae, variable stars and self-lensing.\nThe scale of the induced variability make observations conducive over a single observing season,\nand with the advent of the Next Generation Space\nTelescope, such observations will soon be possible.\nHence, a monitoring program to search for fluctuations of the surface brightness of the plethora of\n< 0.5 offers a effective test of the exisgalaxies at z \u223c\ntence of cosmologically distributed compact matter.\n8.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful for discussions with Mike Hudson, Tom Quinn and Stephen Gwyn. The anonymous referee is thanked for useful comments.\n\nConclusions\n\nRecent studies have claimed that the fluctuations observed in the light curves of high redshift\nquasars are due to the microlensing effect of a\npopulation of cosmologically distributed Jupiter\nmass black holes. While arguments have been\npresented to refute this claim, no observational\ntest of this hypothesis has been readily available.\nIn this paper we have investigated the effect this\nputative population would have on the surface\nbrightness distribution of galaxies out to intermediate redshift. The results of this study conclusively demonstrate that if a significant population\nof cosmologically distributed compact objects are\npresent, with enough mass to account for the universal dark matter budget, then they will induce\na 'twinkling' into the observed surface brightness\ndistributions of galaxies at low to intermediate\nredshifts. The magnitude of the observed fluctuations are a function of the redshift of the source\ngalaxy, ranging from negligible values in the local\nUniverse, to \u223c 1% at z = 0.5, with a time-scale of\nvariability on the order of weeks to months.\nWhile the optical depth to microlensing at such\nlow to intermediate redshifts is still quite small\nand the induced fluctuations are at a relatively\nlow level, the sky density of galaxies out to these\nredshifts vastly exceeds that of supernova and\n\n9\n\n\fKofman, L. , Kaiser, N. , Lee, M.

The solid line represents the number of stars in the population with a luminosity greater that\nL\u2217 , while the dot-dash line is the summed luminosity of this subset of stars. While stars with L > 10 L\u2299\nrepresent only a small fraction of the over all population by number they are responsible for the majority of\nthe total luminosity.\n\n15\n\n\fFig. 5.- The distribution of the mean magnification of a sample of stars for redshifts between z = 0.05 and\nz = 0.5. The dotted vertical line represents the mean value of the relevant magnification distribution, while\nthe lower bound on each plot is \u03bc = 1. Each line consists of a stellar sample of 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000\nstars, depending on its shading. The scale factor, f, is introduced such that all the curves can be placed on\nthe same y-scale. As these are probability distributions, the integrated area under the curve (accounting for\nthe f-scaling) is unity.\n\n16\n\n\fFig. 6.- The distribution in total luminosity of stellar samples from 105 L\u2299 (broadest - dark grey) to 107 L\u2299\n(narrowest - light grey), defined by the luminosity function in the text. At very low redshifts, the low\nmicrolensing optical depth induces only negligible variability, while by a redshift of z = 0.5, fluctuations of\norder a percent are induced. The integrated properties of these distributions are given in Table 1.\n\n17\n\n\fFig. 7.- The variability time scale for a 10\u22123 M\u2299 microlensing mass with a relative transverse velocity of\n1000 km s\u22121, for sources at z = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 & 0.5 .\n\nFig. 8.- The cumulative magnification probabilities for sources at z = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 & 0.5 .\n\n18\n\n\fFig. 9.- The optical depth out to z = 0.5 in several cosmologies. At the low redshifts considered, the\nintroduction of a cosmological constant has only a small influence on the optical depths.\n\n19\n\n\f"}
