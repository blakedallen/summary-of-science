This fact is often\nused (without any reference to quantum theory) by social scientists to argue\nthat their theories are beyond mathematical description. Here we would\nlike to propose a quantum-like approach to economics whose usefulness, we\nthink, can be verified only by further investigation. The approach has roots\nin the recently developed quantum game theory [2]. For simplicity and clearness of the exposition, we shall suppose that there are only two assets on\nthe market. The first one, denoted by $, fulfills the role of money and its\nunit is 1$. The second one, denoted by G, is distributed in units 1G of price\nc in $. We shall also suppose that both assets can be exchanged in arbitrary\nratio. The traders will be numbered by k \u2208 N, N being the natural numbers. The k-th trader implements a strategy (called pure) which is denoted\nby |\u03c8ik and declares that his whole capital consisting of sk units of G and\ndk monetary units will be engaged in market transactions. A player can be\npresent on the market in the shape of several traders what allows him to\n1\n\n\fengage various parts his capital in different ways. The opposite situation is\nalso possible: several traders can form a coalition. Such a clique can be described as correlated strategies of different traders. The actual participation\nof the k-th trader in the market turnover would be decided by an arbiter\nA who considers the data {|\u03c8ik , sk , dk } coming from all traders. The role\nof the arbiter A is performed by an appropriate clearinghouse who acts in\na fully deterministic way according to rules that are established by the law\nor/and tradition. The arbiter A can be identified with the algorithm used\nfor clearing. Market transactions, that is capital flows, are settled according\nto the strategies put forward by the traders |\u03c8ik and the algorithm A. In\nthis way a common price c is set for all transaction in a given turn. If one\nconsiders several markets connected by traders strategies then simultaneous transaction with different prices are possible (e.g. arbitrage is possible).\nNote that the trader is not obliged to know the market rules but such knowledge is necessary if he or she wants to act in a rational way.\nThe quantum model of market Let the real variable q\nq := ln c \u2212 E(ln c)\n\n(1)\n\ndenotes the logarithm of the price at which the k-th player can buy G shifted\nso that its expectation value in the state | \u03c8 >k vanishes. The expectation\nvalue of x is denoted by E(x). The variable p\np := E(ln c) \u2212 ln c\n\n(2)\n\ndescribes the situation of a player who is supplying the asset G according to\nhis strategy |\u03c8ik . Supplying G can be regarded as demanding $ at the price\nc\u22121 in the 1G units and both definitions are equivalent. Note that we have\ndefined q and p so that they do not depend on possible choices of the units for\nG and $. For simplicity we will use such units so E(ln c) = 0. The strategies\nP\n|\u03c8ik belong to Hilbert spaces Hk . The state of the game |\u03a8iin := k |\u03c8ik\nis a vector in the direct sum of Hilbert spaces of all players, \u2295k Hk . We will\ndefine canonically conjugate hermitian operators of demand Qk and supply\nPk for each Hilbert space Hk analogously to their physical counterparts\nposition and momentum. This can be justified in the following way. Let\nexp(\u2212p) be a definite price, where p is a proper value of the operator Pk .\nTherefore, if one have already declared the will of selling exactly at the price\nexp(\u2212p) (the strategy given by proper the state |pik ) then it is pointless to\nput forward any opposite offer for the same transaction. The capital flows\nresulting from an ensemble of simultaneous transactions correspond to the\n2\n\n\fphysical process of measurement. A transaction consists in a transition\nfrom the state of traders strategies |\u03a8iP\nin to the describing\nP the capital flow\nstate |\u03a8iout := T\u03c3 |\u03a8iin , where T\u03c3 := kd |qikd kdhq| + ks |piks kshp| is the\nprojective operator given by the division \u03c3 of the set of traders {k} into\ntwo separate subsets {k} = {kd } \u222a {ks }, that is buying at the price eqkd and\nselling at the price e\u2212pks in the round of transaction in question. The role\nof the algorithm A is to determine the division of the market \u03c3, the set of\nprice parameters {qkd , pks } and the values of capital flows. The later are\nsettled by the distribution\nZ ln c\n|hq|\u03c8ik |2\ndq\n(3)\n\u2212\u221e kh\u03c8|\u03c8ik\nwhich is interpreted as the probability that the trader | \u03c8 >k is willing to\nbuy the asset G at the transaction price c or lower [3]. In an analogous way\nthe distribution\nZ ln 1\n2\nc |hp|\u03c8ik |\ndp\n(4)\n\u2212\u221e kh\u03c8|\u03c8ik\n\ngives the probability of selling G by the trader | \u03c8 >k at the price c or\ngreater. These probabilities are in fact conditional because they describe\nthe situation after the the division \u03c3 is completed.\nMaximization of the capital turnover Every game is specified by its rules\nso to illustrate the action of the algorithm A let us consider an example\nof deterministic clearinghouse algorithm. Suppose that the clearinghouse\nmaximize the capital turnover at a uniform price c. The assumption of\nunique for all traders price\n\u2200kd ,ks (Qkd + Pks )|\u03a8iout = 0\ncorresponds to entanglement in quantum theory. On the market where\ntransaction are made between two traders, the above condition may be fulfilled only for every pair of traders separately. Let us for simplicity limit the\nclass of admissible strategies to those whose amplitudes hq|\u03c8ik (hp|\u03c8ik ) are\nfunctions of the variable q (p) with compact supports and square-integrable.\nAfter fixing the division \u03c3 we can rescale the amplitudes of supply and demand so integrals of the squares of modules of the resulting functions hq|\u03c6ikd\nand hp|\u03c6iks\nhq|\u03c6ikd :=\n\np\n\ndkd\n\nhq|\u03c8ikd\nhp|\u03c8iks\n\u221a\n, hp|\u03c6iks := sks\nh\u03c8|\u03c8i\nkd\nkd\nksh\u03c8|\u03c8iks\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fmeasure the appropriate capital flows. For a transaction at the price c, the\nmaximal capital flow is the lowest number from the possible total buying\nand selling\nnX Z ln c\no\nX Z \u2212 ln c\n2\nj(\u03c3, c) := min\n|hq|\u03c6ikd | dq , c\n|hp|\u03c6iks |2 dp . (6)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nkd\n\nks\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe maximal value is given by the solution of the equation\nX Z ln c\u2217\nX Z \u2212 ln c\u2217\n|hq|\u03c6ikd |2 dq = c\u2217\n|hp|\u03c6iks |2 dp.\nkd\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nks\n\n(7)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThere is at least one solution of the Eq.

The\ndivision \u03c3 \u2217 = (ks\u2217 , kd\u2217 ) corresponding to the maximal capital flow\nj(\u03c3 \u2217 , c\u2217 ) = max j(\u03c3, c\u2217 )\n\u03c3\n\ngives the changes in the amounts of the asset G\nZ\nZ \u2212 ln c\u2217\n\u2217\n1 ln c\n2\n|hq|\u03c6ikd\u2217 | dq , \u2212\n|hp|\u03c6iks\u2217 |2 dp\nc\u2217 \u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nand the money $\nZ\n\u2212\n\nln c\u2217\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\n\u2217\n\n|hq|\u03c6ikd\u2217 | dq , c\n\nZ\n\n\u2212 ln c\u2217\n\u2212\u221e\n\n|hp|\u03c6iks\u2217 |2 dp\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\npossessed by the traders after clearing the round of transactions. The Eq.\n(7) guarantees that the capital changes will be balanced, so the described\ngame belongs to specially interesting zero sum class of game that do not\ngenerate capital surplus nor demand capital inflow (we neglect such cost as\nbrokerage etc). Maximization of the G turnover results in different price\nc\u2217 and capital flows. This asymmetry can be removed by separate normalization\nin Eq. (5) that is by replacing the square roots\nr of the strategies\nq s\ndkd\nk\nby P dl and P ssl , [4] and performing calculations for probabilities\nld\n\nd\n\nls\n\ns\n\ninstead of capital flows. In this case the assumption of compactness of the\nsupports is superfluous. Deutsch arguments [4] can be repeated here to\nshow that the stochastic interpretation of the presented model is not necessary. Note that the asymmetry justifies presentation of the supply and\ndemand curves in terms of probabilities and not capital flows [3]. Another,\n4\n\n\fmore quantum, algorithm can be defined if the transactions are made with\nweights analogous to Eq. (6) for all possible divisions \u03c3 and prices c. Such\ntransactions should be balanced for not realized bids. This algorithm may\nexclude some trades from round of transactions. The transaction operator\nwould resemble the commonly use in quantum theory scattering matrix:\nX\nX\n|piks kshp|,\n|qikd kdhq| + \u03b1s\nT\u03c3\u03b1 := I + \u03b1d\nks\n\nkd\n\nwhere \u03b1d , \u03b1s \u2208 R+ , and I is the identity operator in\n\nP\n\nk\n\n\u2295Hk .\n\nMarket as a measuring apparatus When a game allows a great number\nof players in it is useful to consider it as a two-players game: the trader\n|\u03c8ik against the Rest of the World (RW). (The player RW has a lot in\ncommon with a macroscopic measuring apparatus.) The concrete algorithm\nA may allow for an effective strategy of RW (for a sufficiently large number\nof players the single player strategy should not influence on the form of the\nRW strategy). If one considers the RW strategy it make sense to declare\nits simultaneous demand and supply states because for one player RW is a\nbuyer and for another it is a seller. To describe such situation it is convenient\nto use the Wigner formalism [5]. The pseudo-probability W (p, q)dpdq on the\nphase space {(p, q)} known as the Wigner function is given by\nZ \u221e\n\u22121\nhq + x2 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|q \u2212 x2 i\n\u22121\nW (p, q) := hE\nei\u0127E px\ndx\nh\u03c8|\u03c8i\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u22121\nhp + x2 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|p \u2212 x2 i\n\u22122\ndx,\nei\u0127E px\n= hE\nh\u03c8|\u03c8i\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere the positive constant hE = 2\u03c0\u0127E is the dimensionless economical\ncounterpart of the Planck constant. Recall that this measure is not positive\ndefinite except for the stated bellow cases. In the general case the pseudoprobability density\nP of RW is a countable linear\nP combination of Wigner functions, \u03c1(p, q) =\nn wn Wn (p, q), wn \u2265 0,\nn wn = 1. According to Eq.\n(3) and (4) (see also Ref. [3]) the diagrams of the integrals of the RW\npseudo-probabilities\nZ ln c\n\u03c1(p = const., q)dq\n(10)\nFd (ln c) :=\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(RW bids selling at exp (\u2212p))\nand\nZ\nFs (ln c) :=\n\nln\n\n1\nc\n\n\u03c1(p, q = const.)dp\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n5\n\n(11)\n\n\f(RW bids buying at exp q ) against the argument ln c may be interpreted\nas the dominant supply and demand curves in Cournot convention, respectively [3]. Note, that due to the lack of positive definiteness of \u03c1, Fd and Fs\nmay not be monotonic functions. Textbooks on economics give examples of\nsuch departures from the low of supply (work supply) and low of demand\n(Giffen assets) [6]. We will call an arbitrage algorithm resulting in non positive definite probability densities a giffen.\nQuantum Zeno effect If the market continuously measures the same strategy of the player, say the demand hq|\u03c8i, and the process is repeated sufficiently often for the whole market, then the prices given by the algorithm\nA do not result from the supplying strategy hp|\u03c8i of the player. The necessary condition for determining the profit of the game is the transition of\nthe player to the state hp|\u03c8i [3]. If, simultaneously, many of the players\nchanges their strategies then the quotation process may collapse due to the\nlack of opposite moves. In this way the quantum Zeno effects explains stock\nexchange crashes. Effects of this crashes should be predictable because the\namplitudes of the strategies < p|\u03c8i are Fourier transforms of < q|\u03c8i Another\nexample of the quantum market Zeno effect is the stabilization of prices of\nan asset provided by a monopolist.\nEigenstates of Q and P Let us suppose that the amplitudes for the strategies hq|\u03c8ik or hp|\u03c8ik that have infinite integrals of squares of their modules,\n(hq|\u03c8ik 6\u2208 L2 ) have the natural interpretation as the will of the k-th player\nof buying (selling) of the amount dk ( sk ) of the asset G. So the strategy\nhq|\u03c8ik = hq|ai = \u03b4(q, a) means that in the case of classifying the player to\nthe set {kd }, refusal of buying cheaper than at c = ea and the will of buying\nat any price equal or above ea . In the case of \"measurement\" in the set {kd }\nthe player declares the will of selling at any price. The above interpretation is consistent with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. The strategies\nhq|\u03c8i2 = hq|ai (or hp|\u03c8i2 = hp|ai) do not correspond to the RW behaviour\nbecause the conditions d2 , s2 > 0, if always fulfilled, allow for unlimited\nprofits (the readiness to buy or sell G at any price). The demand Eq. (10)\nand supply Eq. (11) functions give probabilities of coming off transactions\nin the game when the player use the strategy hp|consti or hq|consti and\nRW, proposing the price, use the strategy \u03c1. The authors have analyzed\nthe efficiency of the strategy hq|\u03c8i1 = hq| \u2212 ai in a two-player game when\nRW use the strategy with squared module of the amplitude equal to normal\ndistribution [3]. The maximal intensity of the profit [3] is equal to 0.27603\ntimes the variance of the RW distribution function. Of course, the strategy\n6\n\n\fhp|\u03c8i1 = hp|0, 27603i has the same properties. In such games a=0.27603\nis a global fixed point of the profit intensity function. This may explain\nthe universality of markets on which a single client facing the bid makes\nup his/hers mind. Does it mean that such common phenomena have quantal nature? The Gaussian strategy of RW [7] can be parametrized by the\ntemperature T = \u03b2 \u22121 (see below). Any decrease in profits is only possible\nby reducing the variance of RW (i.e. cooling). Market competition is the\nmechanism responsible for risk flow that allows the market to attain the\nthermodynamical balance. A warmer market influences destructively on the\ncooler traders and they diminish the uncertainty of market prices.\nAdiabatic strategies Financial mathematics teach us that the first moments of the random variables p and q measure the expected profit from one\ntransaction and the second moments measure the risk [8]. Therefore we will\ndefine the observable\n(Pk \u2212 pk0 )2 m\u03c9 2 (Qk \u2212 qk0 )2\n+\n,\n(12)\nH(Pk , Qk ) :=\n2m\n2\nk |\u03c8ik\nk |\u03c8ik\n6= E(Pk ), qk0 := kh\u03c8|Q\n, \u03c9 := 2\u03c0\nwhere pk0 := kh\u03c8|P\n\u03b8 , and call it the\nkh\u03c8|\u03c8ik\nkh\u03c8|\u03c8ik\nrisk inclination operator, cf Ref. [3]. \u03b8 denotes the characteristic time of\ntransaction introduced in the MM model [3]. The parameter m > 0 measures the risk asymmetry between buying and selling positions. Analogies\nwith quantum harmonic oscillator allow for the following characterization of\nquantum market games. The constant hE describes the minimal inclination\nof the player to risk. It is equal to the product of the lowest eigenvalue\nof H(Pk , Qk ) and 2\u03b8. Note that 2\u03b8 is the minimal interval during which\nit makes sense to measure the profit [3]. Except the ground state all the\nadiabatic strategies H(Pk , Qk )|\u03c8i = const|\u03c8i are giffens [5]. Future investigations may reveal the situations foe which the existence of giffens lead to\noptimal strategies.\nIt should be noted here that in a general case the operators Qk do not\ncommute because traders observe moves of other players and often act accordingly. One big bid can influence the market at least in a limited time\nspread. Therefore it is natural to consider noncommutative quantum mechanics [9] where one considers\n\n[xi , xk ] = i\u0398ik := \u0398\u01ebik .\nThe analysis of harmonic oscillator in more then one\nqdimensions [10] imply\nthat the parameter \u0398 modifies the constant hE \u2192 h2E + \u03982 and, accordingly, the eigenvalues of H(Pk , Qk ). This has the natural interpretation that\n7\n\n\fmoves performed by other players can diminish or increase one's inclination\nto taking risk.\nCorrelated coherent strategies We will define correlated coherent strategies as the eigenvectors of the annihilation operator Ck [11]\n1\u0010\nir \u0011\nCk (r, \u03b7) :=\n1+ \u221a\nQk + i\u03b7Pk ,\n2\u03b7\n1 \u2212 r2\nwhere r is the correlation coefficient r \u2208 [\u22121, 1], \u03b7 > 0. In these strategies\nbuying and selling transactions are correlated and the product\nof dispersions\n\u221a\n2\nfulfills the Heisenberg-like uncertainty relation \u2206p \u2206q 1 \u2212 r \u2265 \u01272E and is\nminimal. The annihilation operators Ck and their eigenvectors may be pa\u03b7\ni r This leads to following form of the\nrameterized by \u2206p = \u01272\u03b7E , \u2206q = \u221a1\u2212r\n2\ncorrelated Wigner coherent strategy\nW (p, q)dpdq =\n\n1\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\n\n2\u03c0\u2206p \u2206q 1 \u2212\n\nr2\n\ne\n\n1\n2(1\u2212r 2 )\n\n0)\n( (p\u2212p\n\u22062\np\n\n2\n\n+\n\n(q\u2212q0 )2\n2r(p\u2212p0 )(q\u2212q0 )\n+\n\u2206p \u2206q\n\u22062\nq\n\n)\n\ndpdq.\n\nThey are not giffens. It can be shown, following Hudson [12], that they\nform the set of all pure strategies with positive definite Wigner functions.\nTherefore pure strategies that are not giffens are represented in phase space\n{(p, q)} by gaussian distributions.\nMixed states and thermal strategies According to classics of game theory\n[13] the biggest choice of strategies is provided by the mixed states \u03c1(p, q).\nAmong them the most interesting are the thermal ones. They are characterized by constant inclination to risk, E(H(P, Q)) = const and maximal\nentropy. The Wigner measure for the n-th exited state of harmonic oscillator\nhave the form [5]\nWn (p, q)dpdq =\n\n4H(p, q)\n(\u22121)n \u2212 2H(p,q)\ne \u0127 E \u03c9 Ln (\n)dpdq,\n\u03c0\u0127E\n\u0127E \u03c9\n\nwhere Ln is the n-th Laguerre polynomial. The mixed state \u03c1\u03b2 determined by the Wigner measures Wn dpdq weighted by the Gibbs distribution\n\u2212\u03b2n\u0127 E \u03c9\nhave the form\nwn (\u03b2) := P \u221ee e\u2212\u03b2k\u0127\nE\u03c9\nk=0\n\n\u03c1\u03b2 (p, q)dpdq : =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nwn (\u03b2)Wn (p, q)dpdq\n\nn=0\n\n=\n\n\u03c9\nx e\u2212xH(p,q)\n2\u03c0\n8\n\nx= \u0127 2 \u03c9 tanh(\u03b2\nE\n\n\u0127E \u03c9\n)\n2\n\ndpdq.\n\n\fSo it is a two dimensional normal distribution. It easy to notice that by\nxt\nP\n1\nn\nrecalling that 1\u2212t\ne t\u22121 = \u221e\nn=0 Ln (x)t is the generating function for the\nLaguerre polynomials. It seems to us that the above distributions should determine the shape of the supply and demand curves for equilibrium markets.\nThere is no giffens on such markets. It would be interesting to investigate\nthe temperatures of equilibrium markets. In contrast to the traders temperatures [7] which are Legendre coefficients and measure \"trader's qualities\"\nmarket temperatures are related to risk and are positive. The Feynman path\nintegrals may be applied to the Hamiltonian Eq. (12) to obtain equilibrium\nquantum Bachelier model of diffusion of the logarithm of prices of shares\nthat can be completed by the Black-Scholes formula for pricing European\noptions [14].\nMarket cleared by quantum computer When the algorithm A calculating in a separable Hilbert space Hk does not know the players strategies it\nmust choose the basis in an arbitrary way. This may result in arbitrary long\nrepresentations of the amplitudes of strategies. Therefore the algorithm A\nshould be looked for in the NP (non-polynomial) class and quantum markets\nmay be formed provided the quatum computation technology is possible. Is\nthe quantum arbitrage possible only if there is a unique correspondence between \u0127 and hE ? Penrose ideas concerning the thinking process suggest\nsearching for new physical phenomena (e.g. giffens) on markets, where now\nthe clearing algorithms A are constructed in a non-computational way [15].\nWas the hypothetical evidence given by Robert Giffen in the British Parliament [16] the first ever description of quantum phenomenon? The market\nexchange mechanism has inspired the so called transactional interpretation\nof quantum mechanics [17]. The commonly accepted universality of quantum theory should encourage physicist in looking for traces quantum world\nin social phenomena.\n\nReferences\n[1] W. M. Iatno, D. J. Heinzen, J. J.
