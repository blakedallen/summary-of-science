The hypercohomology of the resulting complex of\nsheaves of holomorphic forms with values in E gives the analytic de Rham cohomology. If X is projective, it\nfollows from the Poincar\u00e9 Lemma and Serre's GAGA, that the algebraic and the analytic de Rham cohomology\ncoincide. Equivalently, if E \u2228 denotes the local system of solutions of the dual connection \u2207\u2228an on the dual bundle\n\u2228 , integration defines a perfect pairing\nEan\n\u2217\nHdR\n(X; E, \u2207) \u00d7 H\u2217(Xan , E \u2228 ) \u2192 C\n\n(1.1)\n\nbetween algebraic de Rham cohomology and singular homology with values in the local system E \u2228 .\nIf we start with a quasi-projective variety U, which we consider to be compactified by a projective variety X, the\nsituation is more complicated. Let D := X r U denote the complement which we assume to be a normal crossing\ndivisor. In [7], P. Deligne introduces the condition for a connection to be regular singular along D generalizing the\nwell-known property for linear differential operators in one variable (Fuchs condition) and proves the comparison\nisomorphism and hence the perfect duality of (1.1) under this assumption ([7], Th\u00e9or\u00e8me II.6.2).\nIn the irregular singular case, the period pairing as in (1.1) is no longer perfect. The appropriate generalization\nis known in dimension one only (cp. [3]). On curves, S. Bloch and H. Esnault define a modified homology, the\nrapid decay homology groups H\u2217rd (Xan ; Ean , \u2207an ) and obtain a perfect duality\n\u2217\n\u2228\nHdR\n(U; E, \u2207) \u00d7 H\u2217rd (Xan , Ean\n, \u2207\u2228an ) \u2192 C ,\n\ngiven by integration. The resulting periods are interesting objects by themselves (the integral representations of the\nclassical Bessel-functions, Gamma-function and confluent hypergeometric functions arise in this way as periods\nof irregular singular rank one connections on curves) and are mysteriously related to ramification data for certain\nwildly ramified l-adic sheaves on curves over a finite field (see e.g. [20]).\nIn the present paper, we want to start the investigation of the higher-dimensional case by studying the period\npairing for irregular rank one connections on complex surfaces. We work entirely in the analytic topology, the\nalgebraic aspect we originally have in mind will be mirrored by looking at an integrable connection on the smooth\n1 NWF\n\nI \u2013 Mathematik, Universit\u00e4t Regensburg, 93040 Regensburg, Germany, email: marco.hien@mathematik.uni-regensburg.de\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPeriods for rank 1 irregular singular connections on surfaces\n\nanalytic manifold X which is meromorphic along the normal crossing divisor D at infinity, i .e. the connection is\ngiven as\n\u2207 : E(\u2217D) \u2192 E \u2297OX \u03a91X|C (\u2217D) ,\nwhere we use the usual notation E(\u2217D) for the sheaf of sections of E meromorphic along D and we skip the\nsubscript an in the following.\nFurthermore, we restrict ourselves to the case of line bundles L with irregular singular connections, which\nwe assume to be good with respect to the divisor D, which is defined as follows: Consider the formal connection\nb\nL := L\u2297 OX|Y\nd (\u2217D), where OX|Y\nd denotes the formal completion of OX with respect to the stratum Y of D considered,\nnamely Y being a smooth component of D or a crossing-point. By a standard argument, b\nL is locally isomorphic\nto the formal completion of a connection of the form e\u03b1 \u2297 R, with \u03b1 \u2208 OX (\u2217D) (cp. [18], Proposition III.2.2.1),\nwhere e\u03b1 denotes the connection on the trivial bundle OX given by \u22071 = d \u03b1 (such that the local solutions are of\nthe form e\u03b1 ), and R is a regular singular connection.\nDefinition 1.1 The connection \u2207 is good with respect to D, if its formal completion locally is isomorphic to the\nformal completion of e\u03b1 \u2297 R with a regular singular R and a local section \u03b1 \u2208 OX (\u2217D), such that the divisor (\u03b1 )\nof \u03b1 is contained in D and negative.\n1\n2\n\u2212 x\u2212m\n. Remark, that the definition means that a good connection \u2207\nWe thus exclude examples like \u03b1 = x\u2212m\n1\n2\nhas a local formal presentation as above, locally at the point x = 0 with coordinates x1 , x2 with D = {x1 x2 = 0} or\nD = {x1 = 0}, such that\n1 \u2212m2\n\u03b1 = x\u2212m\nx2 * u(x)\n1\n\nwith u(0) 6= 0. We will always assume this. Note that any rank one connection will become good after a finite\nnumber of point blow-ups centered at points on D. We will come back to the more general situation (for higher\nrank connections) in a follwing paper.\nWe generalize the notion of rapid decay homology groups and prove that the resulting period pairing between\nthe meromorphic de Rham cohomology and rapid decay homology is perfect:\nTheorem 1.2 Let L be a line bundle on a smooth projective complex surface X. If \u2207 is an integrable connection\nwhich is meromorphic along the normal crossing divisor D \u2282 X and good with respect to D, the period pairing\n\u2217\nHdR\n(X r D; L, \u2207) \u00d7 H\u2217rd (X; L\u2228 , \u2207\u2228 ) \u2212\u2192 C\n\nis a perfect duality.\nIn dimension one, the Levelt-Turrittin theorem and the theory of Stokes structures allows to reduce the higher\nrank case to the case of irregular singular line bundles (cp. [3]). On surfaces, there are analogous partial results\nfor higher rank connections due to C. Sabbah, e.g. an analogue to the Levelt-Turrittin theorem in the case of rank\nless than or equal to 5. However, there are subtle differences between the one- and the two-dimensional situation,\nmainly concerning the non-good situation, with interesting consequences regarding the period pairing as well. We\nwill come back to this in a subsequent paper.\nAdditionally, it turns out to be very difficult to give explicit examples of flat meromorphic connections of\nhigher rank due to the integrability condition imposed. Locally, a rank r connection is given by its connection\nmatrix A = A1 dx1 + A2 dx2 with r \u00d7 r-matrices Ai having meromorphic functions as entries. The integrability\ncondition reads as\n\u2202 A2 \u2202 A1\n\u2212\n= [A1 , A2 ] ,\n\u2202 x1 \u2202 x2\nand it is difficult to find explicit (non-trivial) meromorphic solutions to this equation (cp. the corresponding remark\nin [18], p. 2). It is however possible to construct higher-rank examples by functoriality (in the category of Dmodules), e.g. by pushing forward an irregular singular rank one connection (L, \u2207) on X along some map f : X \u2192\nY . The resulting Gauss-Manin connection lives on the higher direct image R p f\u2217,dR (L, \u2207) of the de Rham complex\n\n\fPeriods for rank 1 irregular singular connections on surfaces\n\n3\n\non X. We will give an example, a two-dimensional generalization of the confluent hypergeometric connection, at\nthe end of this introduction, leading to an explicit meromorphic rank 3 connection on P2 .\nExamples involving line bundles, however, occur in a natural way in the framework of special functions,\nmore precisely the higher dimensional generalizations of well-studied special functions, such as the generalized\nhypergeometrics in the sense of Gelfand and Aomoto and their confluent variants (cp. [9], [11]). For example,\nany closed meromorphic 1-form \u03c9 on X with poles along the normal crossing divisor D gives rise to a singular\nconnection on the trivial line bundle given by\n\u2207 = d +\u03c9 \u2227 .\nIf the 1-form \u03c9 depends on additional parameters, say z \u2208 Z, and if \u03c9 is closed as a 1-form on the product\nX \u00d7 Z (and hence induces an integrable connection on the trivial line bundle OX\u00d7Z ), the resulting periods for the\nrelative connection on X satisfy the Gauss-Manin connection on Z. Bessel-functions and more generally confluent\nhypergeometric functions occur in this way. We want to illustrate this construction with an example.\n1.1 An example: two-dimensional confluent hypergeometrics\nWe fix a, b, c, \u03b1 \u2208 C, with a, b, c 6\u2208 Z satisfying a + b + c = \u22123, as well as additional parameters x, y. Consider the\nconnection on the trivial line bundle OP2 on P2 , which in affine coordinates [1, u1 , u2 ] \u2208 P2 reads as\n\u2207=d+\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nb\nc\nc\na\n+\n+ \u03b1 x du1 +\n+\n+ \u03b1 y du2 .\nu1 1 + u1 + u2\nu2 1 + u1 + u2\n\nSolutions are given by the various branches of\n\nU(u1 , u2 , x, y) := ua1 * ub2 * (1 + u1 + u2 )c * exp(\u03b1 (xu1 + yu2)) .\nThe connection above can be written as \u2207 = d + dloguU, where dlogu denotes the logarithmic derivation with\nrespect to the coordinates u = (u1 , u2 ), i.e. dloguU = dlogu1 U du1 + dlogu2 U du2 .\nIf we interpret the parameters x, y as coordinates in the affine space and compactify with a projective plane at\ninfinity, i.e. we read (x, y) as the point [1, x, y] \u2208 P2 , we obtain an integrable meromorphic connection \u2207 on the\ntrivial line bundle over P2 \u00d7 P2 , namely in affine coordinates\n\u2207abs = d + dlog(u,x,y)U = d + dloguU + \u03b1 u1 dx + \u03b1 u2dy .\nLet D := {u1 u2 = 0} \u222a {1 + u1 + u2 = 0} \u222a {[0,t1 ,t2 ] \u2208 P2 } and X := P2 r D.

In section 2, we define the rapid decay homology groups for line bundles on X\nand its pairing with the meromorphic de Rham cohomology. Afterwards, we reduce the problem of perfectness of\nthe pairing to local questions according to the canonical stratification of the normal crossing divisor D into crossing\npoints and smooth components. Perfectness of the resulting local pairings is proved in several steps in section 4,\ncompleting the proof of the main theorem.\n\n2 Rapid decay homology and the pairing with de Rham cohomology\n2.1 Rapid decay homology\nLet X be a n-dimensional smooth projective complex manifold and D \u2282 X a divisor with normal crossings (i.e. in\nsuitable local coordinates z1 , . . . , zn it is of the form D = {z1 * * * zk = 0} for some 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - such coordinates\nwill be called good w.r.t D). We further consider a line bundle L over X together with an integrable meromorphic\nconnection on X rD with possibly irregular singularities at D. In the usual notation L(\u2217D) for the sheaf of local\nsections in L meromorphic along D, the connection then reads as \u2207 : L(\u2217D) \u2212\u2192 L \u2297 \u03a91 (\u2217D). The rank one local\nsystem of horizontal sections in L on the complement U := X rD will be denoted by\n\u2207\n\nL := ker(L|U \u2192 L|U \u2297 \u03a9U1 ) \u2282 L|U .\nThe dual connection \u2207\u2228 on L\u2228 is characterized by d < e, \u03c6 >=< \u2207e, \u03c6 > + < e, \u2207\u2228 \u03c6 > for local sections e of L\nand \u03c6 of L\u2228 . Let L \u2228 denote the corresponding local system.\nWe assume that the complement U := X rD is Stein, which we can always obtain by joining additional hypersurfaces, where the connection is not singular at all, to D. These do not affect our procedure. Then the de Rham\ncohomology is given by the cohomology of the global sections in U, i.e.\n\u2207\n\np\nHdR\n(U; L(\u2217D), \u2207) = H p (. . . \u2192 \u0393(L \u2297 \u03a9q (\u2217D)) \u2192 \u0393(L \u2297 \u03a9q+1(\u2217D)) \u2192 . . .) .\n\nThe homology we are going to define will be a generalization of the usual notion of singular homology with\ncoefficients in a local system V , where one considers chain complexes built from pairs of a topological chain\ntogether with an element of the stalk of V at the barycentre of the chain. In our situation, we will have to allow\nthe topological chains to be able to meet the divisor D, where the local system L := (L|U )\u2207 is not defined. To this\nend, we will make the following definition:\nDefinition 2.1 For any x \u2208 X, we define the stalk Lx of L to be the usual stalk of L if x \u2208 U and to be the\ncoinvariants\n\u000e\nfor x \u2208 D ,\nLx := (Ly )\u03c01 (U,y) := Ly {v \u2212 \u03c3 v | v \u2208 Ly , \u03c3 \u2208 \u03c01 (U, y)}\n\nwhere y \u2208 U is any point near x \u2208 D and we are taking coinvariants w.r.t. the local monodromy action \u03c01 (U, y) \u2192\nAut(Ly ).\nNow, we can define the notion of rapidly decaying topological chains in analogy to the definition by S. Bloch\nand H. Esnault in [3] on curves. In the following, we denote by \u2206 p the standard p-simplex with barycentre b \u2208 \u2206 p\nand we call a function f : Y \u2192 C from any subset Y \u2282 U of the open complex manifold U analytic, if it is the\nrestriction of an analytic function on an open neighborhood of Y .\n\n\f6\n\nPeriods for rank 1 irregular singular connections on surfaces\n\nDefinition 2.2 A rapid decay p-chain is a pair (c, \u03b5 ) consisting of a continuous map c : \u2206 p \u2192 X, such that the\npre-image c\u22121 (D) is a union of complete subsimplices of \u2206 p , and an element \u03b5 \u2208 Lc(b) . If c(\u2206 p ) 6\u2282 D, we require\nthat \u03b5 \u2208 Lc(b) \u2282 Lc(b) is rapidly decaying in the following sense:\nFor any y \u2208 c(\u2206 p ) \u2229 D, let e denote a local trivialization of L(\u2217D) and z1 , . . . , zn local coordinates at y such that\nlocally D = {z1 * * * zk = 0} and that the coordinates of y fulfill y1 = . . . = yk = 0. With respect to the trivialization\ne of L restricted to U, \u03b5 becomes an analytic function\nf := e\u2217 \u03b5 : c(\u2206 p )rD \u2192 C , (z1 , . . . , zn ) 7\u2192 f (z) .\nWe require that this function has rapid decay at y, i.e. that for all N \u2208 Nk there is a CN > 0 such that\n| f (z)| \u2264 CN * |z1 |N1 * * * |zk |Nk\nfor all z \u2208 c(\u2206 p )rD with small |z1 |, . . . , |zk |.\nWe stress that we do not impose any decay condition on pairs (c, \u03b5 ) with c(\u2206 p ) \u2282 D; nevertheless we call those\npairs rapidly decaying as well.\nNow, let SDp X be the free vector-space over all singular chains \u2206 p \u2192 X meeting D only in full subsimplices and\nlet K prd (X; L) be the C-vector space of all maps\n\n\u03c8 : SDp X \u2192\n\nG\n\nLx ,\n\nx\u2208X\n\nsuch that \u03c8 (c) = 0 for all but finitely many c and that (c, \u03c8 (c)) has rapid decay. We will write c \u2297 \u03b5 \u2208 K prd (X; L)\nfor the element \u03c8 which takes the value \u03b5 at c and zero otherwise. We remark that any element of K prd (X; L) can\nbe written as a finite sum \u2211ri=1 ci \u2297 \u03b5i . The notation \u2297 is justified by the fact, that it is linear in each of the entries.\nrd (X; L), c \u2297 \u03b5 7\u2192\nThere is a natural boundary map \u2202 : K prd (X; L) \u2192 K p\u22121\n\u2211 j (\u22121) j c j \u2297 \u03b5 j , where the sum runs over\nthe faces c j of c and the elements \u03b5 j in the stalk of L at c(b j ), with b j being the barycentre of the jth face of \u2206 p ,\nare given as follows:\ni) if c(b j ) 6\u2208 D, there is a unique homotopy class of paths from c(b) to c(b j ) (e.g. induced by the line [b, b j ] in\n\u2206 p ) and \u03b5 j is defined as the analytic continuation along a representative.\nii) if c(b j ) \u2208 D, we just define \u03b5 j to be the element represented by \u03b5 in the corresponding stalk of coinvariants\nunder monodromy.\nIt can be easily seen, that \u2202 \u25e6 \u2202 = 0 and that \u2202 respects the support of the chains, so that we can define the rapid\ndecay homology as follows:\nDefinition 2.3 For 0/ \u2286 Z \u2286 Y \u2286 X, put\n\u000e\nrd\nC prd (Y, Z; L) := K p (Y ; L) K prd (Z; L) + K prd (D \u2229Y ; L)\n\n(relative version)\n\nand C prd (Y ; L) := C prd (Y, 0;\n/ L) for the absolute version. The rapid decay homology is defined as the homology of\nthe corresponding complexes and denoted by H prd (Y, Z; L) and H prd (Y ; L) respectively.\nNote that we have moduled out the chains that are mapped completely into D as they will not play any role in\nthe pairing with meromorphic differential forms as described below. Nevertheless, one has to include them a priori\ninto the definition of rapid decay chains in order to be able to define the boundary map \u2202 . We also include L into\nthe notation to remind that the rd-homology does not depend on the local system alone, but on the connection.\n\n\fPeriods for rank 1 irregular singular connections on surfaces\n\n7\n\n2.2 The pairing and statement of the main result\n\u2228\nNow, if we have a rapidly decaying chain c \u2297 \u03b5 \u2208 C prd (X;\nR L ) in the dual bundle (with the dual connection) and a\np\nmeromorphic p-form \u03c9 \u2208 L \u2297 \u03a9 (\u2217D), then the integral c < \u03b5 , \u03c9 > converges because the rapid decay of \u03b5 along\nc annihilates the moderate growth of the meromorphic \u03c9 . Let ct denote the topological chain one gets by cutting\noff a small tubular neighborhood with radius t around the boundary \u2202 \u2206 p from the given topological chain c. Then,\nfor c \u2297 \u03b5 \u2208 C prd (X; L\u2228 ) and \u03b7 \u2208 L \u2297 \u03a9 p\u22121(\u2217D) a meromorphic p \u2212 1-form, we have the 'limit Stokes formula'\n\nZ\n\n< \u03b5 , \u2207\u03b7 >= lim\nt\u21920\n\nc\n\nZ\n\n< \u03b5 , \u2207\u03b7 >= lim\n\nZ\n\nt\u21920\n\u2202 ct\n\nct\n\n< \u03b5 , \u03b7 >=\n\nZ\n\n< \u03b5, \u03b7 >\n\n\u2202 c\u2212D\n\nwhere in the last step we used that by the given growth/decay conditions the integral over the faces of \u2202 ct 'converging' against the faces of \u2202 c contained in D vanishes.\nThe limit Stokes formula easily shows in the standard way that integrating a closed differential form over a\ngiven rd-cycle (i.e. with vanishing boundary value) only depends on the de Rham class of the differential form and\nthe rd-homology class of the cycle. Thus, we have:\nProposition 2.4 Integration induces a well defined bilinear pairing\np\nHdR\n(U; L(\u2217D), \u2207) \u00d7 H prd (X; L\u2228 ) \u2212\u2192 C , ([\u03c9 ], [c \u2297 \u03b5 ]) 7\u2192\n\nZ\n\n< \u03c9,\u03b5 > ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nc\n\nwhich we call the period pairing of (L, \u2207).\nOur main result is the following\nTheorem 2.5 On a complex surface X, the period pairing is perfect for any irregular singular line bundle which\nis good with respect to D.\nRemark, that for dim(X) = 1 (and arbitrary rank) the perfectness was proved by S.

We will refer to the pairing above as the irregularity pairing. Note, that the de Rham complex of\nLess L\nmero coincides up to a shift of degrees with the irregularity complex introduced by Z. Mebkhout (cp. [17]).\n\n3 Localization according to stratification of the divisor\n\nFrom now on, we concentrate on the case dim(X) = 2. In this section, we want to reduce the question of perfectness\nof the irregularity pairing in two steps. The first one, being rather standard, reduces to the local situation according\nto an open covering of the divisor. This leaves us with the task to study two different local situations, namely with\nD being of the form D = {x1 = 0} or D = {x1 x2 = 0} in suitable local coordinates. In order to understand the\nsituation at a crossing point, we will further split the pairing into one concentrating at the crossing point and one\ndetermining the contribution of the connection along the two local components meeting at 0.\nIf U denotes an open covering of X, we have two cohomological spectral sequences, the first one considered\nbeing\n\u000e\np+q\nq L \u000e\nE2p,q = H p (U , HdR\n(X; Less Lmero ) ,\n( ess Lmero )) =\u21d2 HdR\n\u000e\np\nq L \u000e\nwhere HdR\n(U \u2032 , Less Lmero ). In the same way, one has a homological\n( ess Lmero ) denotes the presheaf U \u2032 7\u2192 HdR\nspectral sequence involving the sheafified rapid decay complex C\u2217rd . To define the latter, we contruct the sheaf Crd\u2217\nof rapid decay cochains as the sheaf associated to the presheaf U \u2032 7\u2192 Hom(C\u2217rd (U \u2032 ,U \u2032 rD; D), C) and let\nC\u2217rd := H omC (Crd\u2217 , C)\nbe its dual sheaf. We consider the dual (cohomological) spectral sequence\nrd\nEe2p,q = H p (U , Cqrd )\u2228 =\u21d2 H p+q\n(X, X rD; D)\u2228 .\n\nObviously, the pairing above induces a morphism between these two spectral sequences. In order to prove perfectness of (2.1), we therefore can do so for the local situation. i.e. a suitable open covering. For small enough open\nU \u2032 , we thus have to consider two cases, the one at a crossing point and the one at a smooth point of D.

We start with the proof for i).\nWe claim, that if \u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba 6\u2282 S0 , then there is no rapidly decaying chain c \u2297 \u03b5 approaching 0 inside \u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba , which is\nnot entirely contained in D. For, let l = [0, ei\u03b81 ] and \u03ba = [0, ei\u03b82 ] and suppose that \u03b5 = e\u03b1 (x) is rapidly decaying as\nx varies in c, it follows that\n\nexp(|x1 |\u2212m1 |x2 |\u2212m2 * |u(x)| * cos(\u2212m1 \u03b81 \u2212 m2 \u03b82 + arg(u(x)))) \u2264 CNM |x1 |N |x2 |M\nfor x \u2208 c. But then \u2212m1 \u03b81 \u2212 m2 \u03b82 + arg(u(x)) \u2208 (\u03c0 /2, 3\u03c0 /2) for x small enough and therefore (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) \u2208 \u03a30 and,\nbecause of the properties of the chosen decomposition with respect to the Stokes bisectors, finally (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) \u2208 \u03a30 ,\nthus \u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba \u2282 S0 . For \u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba \u2282 S0 , however, the assertion is clear.\nIn order to prove part ii), consider (S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba ) \u2229 S0 , which is either empty or connected by assumption. Let\n\u03bd =: [\u03be , \u03be \u2032 ] \u2282 S1 and let \u03b6 be the direction of the line \u03ba , i.e. \u03ba = [0, ei\u03b6 ] \u2282 C. Then (S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba ) \u2229 S0 is the union of\nthe radii with directions contained in (\u03bd \u00d7 {\u03b6 }) \u2229 \u03a30 \u2282 S1 \u00d7 S1 , with \u03a30 being the Stokes directions. Let \u03c1 be the\ninterval \u03c1 := \u03bd \u2229 \u03a30 . If \u03c1 is empty or \u03c1 = \u03bd the assertion is clear. Otherwise, assume that \u03c1 = [\u03be , \u03b7 ] ( [\u03be , \u03be \u2032 ] = \u03bd .\nLet \u03bb be the radius with direction \u03be , so that we now have \u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba \u2282 S0 . If h : [0, 1] \u00d7 (\u03bd \u00d7 {\u03b6 }) \u2192 (\u03bd \u00d7 {\u03b6 }) denotes\nthe linear retraction of \u03bd to {\u03b6 }, i.e. h(t, (x, \u03b6 )) = ((1 \u2212 t)x + t \u03be , \u03b6 ), then\nH : [0, 1] \u00d7 (S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba ) \u2192 (S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba ) , (t, (r1 eix , r2 ei\u03b6 )) 7\u2192 (r1 eih(t,x,\u03b6 ) , r2 ei\u03b6 )\nretracts S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba to \u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba \u2282 S0 . We claim, that H preserves the rapid decay condition. To prove this, consider a\ncurve \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba with \u03b3 \u22121 (D) = 0, such that \u03b5 = e\u03b1 (x) is rapidly decaying along \u03b3 . We have to show that\n\u03b5 then is rapidly decaying along all the curves H(t, .) \u25e6 \u03b3 , t \u2208 [0, 1]. Let \u03b3 (s) = (r1 (s)ei\u03b8 (s) , r2 (s)ei\u03b6 ). From the rapid\ndecay of \u03b5 along \u03b3 , it is clear that the direction of \u03b3 at the point \u03b3 (0) \u2208 D is in the closure of the Stokes-directions,\ni.e. (\u03b8 (0), \u03b6 ) \u2208 \u03a30 . But then, the direction of the transposed curve H(t, .) \u25e6 \u03b3 at the point H(t, \u03b3 (0)) by construction\nlies in \u03a30 , whence \u03b5 is rapidly decaying along this curve. Thus, H induces isomorphisms\nH\u2217rd (S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba , \u2202 ) \u223c\n= H\u2217rd (\u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba , \u2202 ) \u223c\n= H\u2217 ((\u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba ) \u2229 S0, \u2202 ) \u223c\n= H\u2217 ((S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba ) \u2229 S0, \u2202 ) .\n\u2737\nThe proposition now follows immediately using the 5-lemma applied to the morphism (4.1) induces on the\nvarious Mayer-Vietoris sequences above ((4.2) \u2013 (4.4)).\n\u2737\nComputing the singular homology groups appearing in the proposition, we obtain the following\nTheorem 4.4 For a rank 1 connection L with formal model e\u03b1 \u2297 R, we have\n(\n0\nf or \u2217 = 1 or \u2217 \u2265 4\nrd\ndim H\u2217 (\u2206, \u2202 ) =\n(m1 , m2 ) for \u2217 = 2 or 3,\n1 \u2212m2\nwhere \u03b1 = x\u2212m\nx2 * u\u03b1 (x) with u\u03b1 (0) 6= 0 and (m, n) denotes the greatest common divisor of two non-negative\n1\nintegers m, n. Note, that the homology groups in degree 0 will play no role here.\n\n\fPeriods for rank 1 irregular singular connections on surfaces\n\n17\n\nProof: The subspace of the Stokes directions \u03a30 \u2282 S1 \u00d7 S1 of \u03b1 are homotopy equivalent to a torus knot of type\n(m1 , m2 ), which we denote by K . Let R \u2282 \u2206 be the union of the radial sheets with directions in K , a radial sheet\nbeing the product of the two radii in each direction, S\nthen the homology group to be computed is isomorphic to\nH\u2217 (R, \u2202 \u2206 \u222a D). Now, consider a decomposition \u2206 = S(\u03bdi ) \u00d7 S(\u03bc j ) in bisectors as above, where we assume that\nthe intersection of S0 with any bisector has at most one connected component. Now observe that for two radii \u03bb\nand \u03ba and a sector S(\u03bd ) one has homotopy equivalences\n\u000e\n\u000e\n(\u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba ) \u2202 \u2206 \u222a D \u2243 S2 and (l \u00d7 S(\u03bd )) \u2202 \u2206 \u222a D \u2243 S2 .\n(4.5)\n\nStarting with this observation, we can make our way through the various Mayer-Vietoris sequences induced from\nthe decomposition of \u2206 in direct analogy to the sequences (4.2) \u2013 (4.4). One easily deduces that the homology\ngroups to be computed vanish in degree 1 and greater than or equal to 4. As for the remaining degrees 2, 3,\none sees that the one-dimensional contributions coming from H2 (S2 ) = C via (4.5) distinguish each other as long\nas they come from points on the torus knot K (i.e. the endpoint of \u03bb \u00d7 \u03ba or any direction of some S(\u03bd ) \u00d7 \u03ba\nrespectively) that belong to the same connected component of the torus knot. A careful book-keeping thus gives\nthe desired result for H2 and H3 , the integers (m1 , m2 ) being the number of connected components of the torus\nknot. (Another way to look at it, is to cut the torus along the knot K and to use a Mayer-Vietoris argument to\nsee that the dimension of the homology groups in question are given as the dimension of the analogous homology\ngroups in the special case m1 = 1 = m2 , which is easily seen to be 1, times the number of connected components\nof the torus knot K , namely (m1 , m2 )).\n\u2737\n4.1.2 Local de Rham cohomology\n\u2217 (L /L + L ) at the crossing point, where the\nWe are now going to compute the local de Rham cohomology HdR\ness\n1\n2\n\u2212m1 \u2212m2\n\u03b1\nrank one connection L has the formal model e \u2297 R with \u03b1 = x1 x2 * u\u03b1 (x1 , x2 ) with u\u03b1 (0, 0) 6= 0.\nSince the sheaf Less /L1 + L2 has support at the origin, it is sufficient to consider the stalk at 0.

By definition, there are\n1\n\n2\n\nnumbers N, M with g, h \u2208 K\u2212M,\u2212N . We want to solve \u03c6 ( f ) = (g, h). To this end, let fkl := 0 for all k, l with\nk < \u2212M + m1 + 1 and l < \u2212N + m2 + 1, but (k, l) 6= (\u2212M + m1 , \u2212N + m2 ). The desired equation for f induces the\nnecessary equality of\n1\n1\nf\u2212M+m1 ,\u2212N+m2 = \u2212 g\u2212M\u22121,\u2212N = \u2212 h\u2212M,\u2212N\u22121 .\nm1\nm2\nNow, \u03c8 (g, h) = 0 reads as\n(k + 1)hk+1,l \u2212 (l + 1)gk,l+1 + m2 gk+m1 ,l+m2 +1 \u2212 m1hk+m1 +1,l+m2 = 0\n\n(4.8)\n\nfor k < \u22122m1 and l < \u22122m2 .

Using (4.8) for k =\n\u2212M \u2212 m1 , l = \u2212N \u2212 m2 gives the desired equality m2 g\u2212M\u22121,\u2212N = m1 h\u2212M,\u2212N\u22121 and therefore the well-definedness\nof f\u2212M+m1 ,\u2212N+m2 .\nIn the same manner, we can solve the equation k fkl \u2212m1 fk+m1 ,l+m2 = gk\u22121,l successively and get the coefficients\nfor the remaining indices in A := {(k, l)|k \u2264 1, l \u2264 1}r{(k, l)|k \u2264 \u2212M + m1 , l \u2264 \u2212N + m2 }.

The same computations give a solution fe \u2208 L1 + L2 for the second\ndirect summand, i.e. pr2 (\u03c6 ( fe)) = h. Using \u03c8 (g, h) = 0 as above, we easily see that the above calculations give the\nsame coefficients fkl = fekl , so that we have found an f \u2208 L1 + L2 with \u03c6e( f ) = (g, h).\n\n\fPeriods for rank 1 irregular singular connections on surfaces\n\n19\n\n\u000e\nTo see the surjectivity of \u03c8 , let u \u2208 L1 + L2 K\u22122m1 ,\u22122m2 be given, represented by u \u2208 K\u2212M,\u2212N for suitable M, N.\nLet h := 0.

More precisely, one has dim ker(E) = d + 2 and dim coker(E) = d + 3, where d :=\n(m1 , m2 ) denotes the greatest common divisor of m1 and m2 .\nProof: We first calculate the dimension of the cokernel. Let u := \u2211k,l ukl xk1 xl2 \u2208 P2m1 ,2m2 . We have to solve\nE(g, h) = u. In terms of the coefficients in Laurent series expansions this reads as\n\n\u03c8kl := \u2212(k \u2212 1)hk\u22121,l + (l \u2212 1)gk,l\u22121 + m2gk\u2212m1 ,l\u2212m2 \u22121 \u2212 m1 hk\u2212m1 \u22121,l\u2212m2 = 0\n\n(4.14)\n\nfor all (k, l) \u2208 A, where A := {(k, l) \u2208 N0 \u00d7 N0 | k \u2264 2m1 or l \u2264 2m2 }. Observe that in most cases either the first\ntwo or the last two summands vanish, as gkl = hkl = 0 for indices k, l 6\u2208 A. There are several different cases of pairs\n(k, l) \u2208 A to be considered:\ni) (k < m1 or l < m2 ) and (k > 0 and l > 0): then (4.14) for the pair (k, l) and the pair (k + m1 , l + m2 ) gives\n(k \u2212 1)hk\u22121,l + (l \u2212 1)gk,l\u22121 = ukl and \u2212 m1 hk\u22121,l + m2 gk,l\u22121 = uk+m1 ,l+m2 .\nii) k = 0 and l > 0: Then (4.14) gives \u03c80,l = (l \u2212 1)g0,l\u22121 = u0,l , \u03c8m1 ,l+m2 =\n= \u2212(m1 \u2212 1)hm1\u22121,m2 +l + (m2 + l \u2212 1)gm1 ,m2 +l\u22121 + m2g0,l\u22121 = um1 ,m2 +l\nand \u03c82m1 ,2m2 +l = m2 gm1 ,m2 +l\u22121 \u2212 m1 hm1 \u22121,m2 +l = u2m1 ,2m2 +l .\niii) k > 0 and l = 0: in analogy to the case ii), this gives \u03c8k,0 = \u2212(k \u2212 1)hk\u22121,0 = uk,0 , \u03c8m1 +k,m2 =\n= \u2212(m1 + k \u2212 1)hm1+k\u22121,m2 + (m2 \u2212 1)gm1+k,m2 \u22121 \u2212 m1 hk\u22121,0 = um1 +k,m2\nand \u03c82m1 +k,2m2 = m2 gm1 +k,m2 \u22121 \u2212 m1 hm1 +k\u22121,m2 = u2m1 +k,2m2 +l .\niv) (k, l) = (0, 0): Gives the equation u0,0 = 0.\nv) (k, l) \u2208 {(m1 , m2 ), (2m1 , 2m2 )}: Then (4.14) gives\n\n\u03c8m1 ,m2\n\u03c82m1 ,2m2\n\n= \u2212(m1 \u2212 1)hm1 \u22121,m2 + (m2 \u2212 1)gm1 ,m2 \u22121 = um1 ,m2 and\n= \u2212m1 hm1 \u22121,m2 + m2 gm1 ,m2 \u22121 = u2m1 ,2m2 .\n\nBy some simple matrix calculations one sees that case i) gives a d-dimensional contribution to coker(E) if m1 6= m2\nand a (d \u2212 1)-dimensional contribution if m1 = m2 ; cases ii) and iii) each give a one-dimensional contribution.\nCase iv) contributes with a one-dimensional subspace, whereas case v) adds another dimension if m1 6= m2 and no\ncontribution for m1 = m2 .

We remark that the convergence of the solutions we obtain by the combinatorics of the Laurent\ncoefficients above is an easy exercise.\nTo compute the dimension of ker(E) we proceed in a similar manner, looking at the cases i) \u2013 v) above with\nu = 0. Again, one easily sees that case i) give a d-dimensional subspace if m1 6= m2 and a (d \u2212 1)-dimensional\none for m1 = m2 , cases ii) and iii) each add one dimension, case iv) gives no contribution to ker(E) and case v)\ncontributes with a one-dimensional subspace for m1 = m2 and gives no solution for m1 6= m2 . Hence, we have\ndim ker(E) = d + 2 ,\nfrom which the lemma follows.\n\u2737\nWe are left with the task to calculate the index of the complex given by the middle column of (4.13).

Additionally, our knowledge about the dimensions of the (co-)homology\ngroups involved (Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.5) then induce that \u03b3 is surjective, hence \u03b1 is injective by the 5lemma. This proves perfectness from the left for p = 1.\n\u2737\n4.2 Local pairing at a crossing-point involving one direction\nTo complete the investigation of the situation at a crossing point of D, we have to consider the pairing involving the\ncontributions from the one-dimensional local strata of D. Let \u2206 denote a small bi-disc around the crossing point\n(0, 0) \u2208 D, where we chose local coordinates such that D = {x1 x2 = 0} = D1 \u222a D2 . We prove the following\nTheorem 4.10 The local pairing\n\u000e\np\u22121\nHdR\n(\u2206; Less L2 ) \u00d7 H prd (\u2206rD2 , \u2206rD; D) \u2192 C\n\n(4.20)\n\nfor the local contribution of the connection along D1 at the crossing point is perfect.\nProof: We omit \u2206 from the notation of de Rham cohomology. Recall that L has the elementary model e\u03b1 \u2297 R,\nwhere \u03b1 (x) = x1\u2212m\u03b1 * u(x) with u(0) 6= 0.\nWe now prove the analogue of Theorem 4.4, namely\nProposition 4.11 In the situation above, we have\ndim H\u2217rd (\u2206rD2 , \u2206rD; D)\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\n0\nm\n\nfor \u2217 \u2265 3\nfor \u2217 = 1, 2 .\n\n\u00d7\n\u223c 1\nProof: We have the Stokes directions in \u03c0 \u22121 (D\u00d7\n1 ) = S \u00d7 D1 :\n\n\u03c0 \u03c0\n\u03a31 := {(\u03b81 , x2 ) \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (0, x2 ) | \u2212m1 \u03b81 + arg(u(0, x2 )) \u2208 ( , )} ,\n2 2\nwhere D\u00d7\n1 := D1 r0, and the fibration by Stokes sectors, which reads in local coordinates as\nS1 :=\n\n[\n\nR+ ei\u03b81 \u00d7 {x2 } .\n\n(\u03b81 ,x2 )\u2208\u03a31\n\u00d7\nNote, that one may regard S1 as a subset of the disc bundle associated to the normal bundle DN(D\u00d7\n1 ) of D1 in X,\n\u00d7\n\u03b1\nwhich we identify with \u2206rD2 . In each fiber over (0, x2 ) \u2208 D1 it is determined by the Stokes sectors of e , i.e. the\nsectors, where e\u03b1 has rapid decay for x1 \u2192 0.\nDecomposing S1 into small enough intervals and thereby \u2206rD2 into the corresponding fibration by sectors,\nwe can apply Mayer-Vietoris sequences in the same way as we did in the proof of Proposition 4.2. With the same\narguments as before, the statement analogous to Proposition 4.2 follows, namely a decomposition as ordinary\nsingular homology groups:\nH\u2217rd (\u2206rD2 , \u2206rD; D) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (V1 \u2229 S1 , \u2202 V1 \u222a D) ,\n\nwhere S1 denotes the fibration by Stokes sectors corresponding to e\u03b1 and V1 denotes a small tubular neighborhood\nof D\u00d7\n1 := D1 r0.\n\n\fPeriods for rank 1 irregular singular connections on surfaces\n\n25\n\nIt remains to show, that\ndim H\u2217 (V1 \u2229 \u03a31 , \u2202 V1 \u222a D; D) =\n\n\u001a\n\n0\nm\u03b1\n\nfor \u2217 \u2265 3\nfor \u2217 = 1, 2\n\n(4.21)\n\n\u00d7\nThe topological situation looks as follows. Consider the fiber DN(D\u00d7\n1 )x of the normal disc bundle of D1 at\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u03b1\nsome point x := (0, x2 ) \u2208 D1 . We denote by \u03c3 \u2282 DN(D1 )x the Stokes sectors inside this disc, i.e. the intersection\n\u00d7\n\u03c3 \u03b1 = \u03a3\u03b11 \u2229 DN(D\u00d7\n1 )x . Now, we can retract the tubular neighborhood V1 of D1 to the trivial bundle with base space\n\u00d7\n1\nbeing a circle S around D2 and with fiber DN(D1 )x , as well as the Stokes sectors \u03c3\u03b1 in this fiber to the union of\nm\u03b1 radii, one for each Stokes sector. Now, we have to identify all points in the boundary \u2202 V1 as well as those in D.\nIn the fiber DN(D\u00d7\nresult in a wedge of m circles, and we finally are left with a trivial bundle over the circle\n1 )x , this\nW\nS1 with fiber the wedge m\u03b1 S1 , where we still have to identify the 'zero'-section S1 \u00d7 {pt} \u2282 D\u00d7\n1 , {pt} being the\nbase point of the wedge of the m\u03b1 circles. Thus,\nW 1 \u000e\n\u0001\n1\nH\u2217 (V1\u00d7 \u2229 \u03a3\u03b11 , \u2202 V1 \u222a D) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (S \u00d7 S ) (S1 \u00d7 {pt}) .\nm\n\u03b1\n\nUsing the K\u00fcnneth isomorphism and the effect of collapsing the one-cell S1 \u00d7 {pt}, one easily sees that the latter\nsingular homology spaces obviously have the desired dimensions as in (4.21).\n\u2737\nNext, we calculate the dimension of the corresponding de Rham cohomology groups from the pairing (4.20):\nProposition 4.12 In the situation from above, we have\n\u000e\n\u2217 L\ndim HdR\n( ess L2 ) =\n\n\u001a\n\n0\nm\n\nfor \u2217 6= 0, 1\nfor \u2217 = 0, 1 .\n\nProof: As before, the regular singular part R gives no contribution to the dimension, so that we can assume it is\n\u22121\ntrivial.
