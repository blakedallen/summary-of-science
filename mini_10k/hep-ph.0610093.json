Since both real and virtual corrections are infrared\nand collinear (IRC) divergent, but their sum is finite, incomplete real-virtual\ncancellations give rise to large logarithms L = ln Q/Q0 in perturbative (PT)\nexpansions, which spoil their convergence.\nPT predictions should therefore be improved by resumming logarithmic\nenhanced terms to all orders. In the luckiest cases, a resummed cross section \u03c3(L) can be written in the exponentiated form \u03c3(L) = exp{Lg1 (\u03b1s L) +\ng2 (\u03b1s L) + \u03b1s g3 (\u03b1s L) + . . . }, where g1 , g2 , g3 , etc. contain leading logarithms\n(LL, \u03b1ns Ln+1 ), next-to-leading logarithms (NLL, \u03b1ns Ln ) next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithms (NNLL, \u03b1ns Ln\u22121 ) and so on.\nThe basis of resummation is all-order factorisation of IRC divergences [1].\nAny IRC singular contribution to a Feynman graph G (a.k.a. leading region\nGL ) can be written schematically as the following convolution:\nGL = H \u2297\n\nnl\nY\n\nl=1\n\nJl \u2297 S ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere:\n1. H is the hard vertex containing lines whose virtuality is of order of the\nhard scale of the process;\n2. nl jet functions Jl , one for each hard massless leg l, containing all collinear\nsingularities;\n3. a soft function S embodying infrared singularities.\nSince the contribution of G to a physical cross section is obtained by summing over all possible final-state cuts, it is clear that virtual corrections are\nobservable independent, while the contribution of real emissions is what discriminates an observable from the other, and understanding it is the key to\n\n\f2\n\nAndrea Banfi\n\nresummation. In particular there is a considerable difference between inclusive observables, like total cross sections, in which one is not interested in\nthe structure of the final state, and final-state observables, like event-shape\ndistributions, where one puts a direct veto on real emissions.\nFor inclusive observables, real contributions are factorised via an integral\ntransform, and the transformed cross section \u03c3\u0303(L) exponentiates:\n\u03c3\u0303(L) \u2243 C(\u03b1s ) eE(\u03b1s ,L) .\n\n(2)\n\nThe best known examples of inclusive resummations are threshold [2] and\ntransverse momentum [3] resummations. Here we briefly present results [4, 5]\nfor Higgs production in hadron-hadron collisions, the knowledge of which is\nfundamental for the LHC. Results for other processes can be found in refs. [2]\nand [3].\nThreshold resummation\n\u221a is needed for the total Higgs cross section when the\navailable partonic energy \u015d is close to the Higgs mass MH . In this limit only\nsoft emissions are allowed and the cross section develops large logarithms ln(1\u2212\n2\nMH\n/\u015d). After a Mellin transform these become logarithms of N , the variable\n2\nconjugated to MH\n/\u015d, and at threshold N \u2192 \u221e. The exponent E(\u03b1s , ln N ) is\ngiven by\n2\nE(\u03b1s (MH\n), ln N )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\" Z\n\u00d7 2\n\n1\n\ndz\n\nz N \u22121 \u2212 1\n\u00d7\n1\u2212z\n\n0\n2\n(1\u2212z)2 MH\n\n2\nMH\n\n#\ndq 2\n2\n2\n2\nA(\u03b1s (q )) + D(\u03b1s ((1 \u2212 z) MH )) . (3)\nq2\n\nThe function A(\u03b1s ) contains soft and collinear contributions (double logarithms), while single logarithms are embodied in the function D(\u03b1s ). Both\nfunctions have an expansion in powers of \u03b1s . Our knowledge of E(\u03b1s , ln N )\nextends at NNLL level, i.e. we know A3 [6] and D2 [4].1 The numerical results\nof ref. [4] show one of the main benefits of resummation, the considerable\nreduction of renormalisation and factorisation scale dependence.\nLarge logarithms ln(qT /MH ) in the Higgs transverse momentum distribution d\u03c3/dqT are resummed via a Fourier transform. In the space of impact\nparameter b (conjugated to qT ) the resummed exponent is [5]\n2\nE(\u03b1s (MH\n), ln b)\n\n=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n2\nMH\n\nb20 /b2\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\ndq 2\nMH\n2\n2\nA(\u03b1s (q )) ln 2 + B(\u03b1s (q )) ,\nq2\nq\n\n(4)\n\nwhere A(\u03b1s ) is the same as for threshold resummations, while single logarithms build up the function B(\u03b1s ). The exponent in eq. (4) is known up to\nNNLL accuracy, i.e. we know the second order coefficient B2 [5]. Not only does\n1\n\nActually also D3 is known [7]. However, since A4 is still unknown, we cannot push\nresummations beyond NNLL accuracy.\n\n\fResummations in QCD: recent developments\n\n3\n\nresummation reduce renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties, but\nalso ensures that the resulting qT spectrum vanishes linearly at small qT , as\nis expected on physical grounds.\nIn recent years a method to combine threshold and transverse momentum resummation has been developed. This procedure, called joint resummation, has been exploited to extend transverse momentum resummations\nto the threshold region [8], where eq. (4) breaks down, and to improve the\ndescription of the qT spectra of prompt photons [9] and heavy quarks [10] .\nThere are also processes, involving low momentum scales, where a fixed\nlogarithmic resummation is not sensible, since the factorial divergence of the\nPT exponent (always present in QCD) cannot be neglected. For instance in the\ndecay b \u2192 s\u03b3, after resummation of all terms responsible for the divergence,\nthe N -th moment FN (MB ) of the photon energy spectrum can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM \u2212mb\n\u039bQCD\n(N \u22121) B\nPT\nNP\nMB\nFN (MB ) = FN (mb ) \u00d7 e\n(N \u2212 1)\n,\n\u00d7 FN\nMB\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nu\n\u039bQCD\nCF \u221e du\n(5)\nT (u)\n\u00d7\nFNPT (mb ) = exp{\n\u03b20 0 u\nmb\n\u00d7 [BS (u)\u0393 (\u22122u)(N 2u \u2212 1) + BJ (u)\u0393 (\u2212u)(N u \u2212 1)]} .\n\nThe functions BJ (u) and BS (u) are the Borel transforms of the jet and soft\nfunction respectively (see eq. (1)). The factorial divergence of the PT exponent\nreflect in poles away from u = 0 in the integrand in eq. (5). Regulating the\nu-integral with a principal value prescription and using the pole b-quark mass\nmb , one finds that all leading power corrections depend only on the mass\ndifference MB \u2212 mb between the meson and the quark, while higher power\ncorrections, contained in the function FNNP , turn out to be not very important,\nso that one can even attempt a measure of mb and \u03b1s [11].\nFor final-state observables, such as event-shapes or jet-resolution parameters (see [12] for a recent review), a general statement concerning exponentiation of resummed distributions does not exist. This is mainly due to the fact\nthat veto conditions on real emissions differ from one variable to the other,\nand in many cases a full analytical resummation is unfeasible. However there\nis a class of variables v, which share the properties of globalness and recursive\ninfrared-collinear (rIRC) safety [13], for which one can resum the corresponding rate \u03a3(v) at NLL level. More precisely, one can show that for rIRC safe\nvariables all leading logarithms (and part of the NL logarithms) exponentiate,\nand the remaining NLL contributions factorise:\n\u03a3(v) = e\u2212R(v) F (R\u2032 ) ,\n\nR\u2032 = \u2212v\n\ndR\n.\ndv\n\n(6)\n\nBoth the exponent R(v) and the correction factor F (R\u2032 ) can be computed via\na general master formula. This makes it possible to perform the resummation\nin a fully automated way, as implemented in the program caesar [13].\n\n\f4\n\nAndrea Banfi\n\nFor other variables, for instance the so-called non-global variables [14],\nthe situation is less clear. Non-global variables measure radiation only in a\nrestricted phase space region, a typical example being the energy flow away\nfrom hard jets. In this case some approximations for multi-parton matrix\nelements that are valid for global rIRC variables do not hold any more, and a\nresummation can be performed only numerically and in the large Nc limit [14,\n15]. Furthermore, large logarithms for these observables come only from soft\nemissions at large angles, so that one naively expects leading logarithms to be\nof the form \u03b1ns Ln . However there has been recently a claim that in hadronhadron collisions super-leading logarithms \u03b1ns Ln+1 arise at higher orders [16].\nProperties of these new logarithms have not been fully investigated yet.\n\nReferences\n1.
