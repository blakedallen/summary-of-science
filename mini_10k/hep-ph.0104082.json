INTRODUCTION\n\nIn perturbative QCD, calculations of physical quantities such as scattering amplitudes or cross sections beyond the\nBorn approximation basically requires one to account for running \u03b1s effects. In fixed-order calculations, \u03b1s becomes\nrunning in a straightforward way, by direct calculation of Feynman graphs. However, in various approaches, scattering\namplitudes or cross sections are often calculated to all orders of the perturbation theory. Generally this means that\nsome equations are constructed and solved and when such equations include the running of \u03b1s , the argument of \u03b1s\nis usually fixed by certain prescriptions which are based on different approximations. For example, for hard QCD\nprocesses exploiting DGLAP evolution [1], one takes\n2\n\u03b1s = \u03b1s (k\u22a5\n)\n\n(1)\n\nin every rung of quark/gluon ladder, with k\u22a5 being the transverse momentum of the ladder parton. As a consequence,\nin the evolution equations\n\u03b1s = \u03b1s (Q2 ),\n\n(2)\np\nwith Q2 being the upper limit for integration over transverse momenta k\u22a5 of ladder partons. In particular, when\nthe DGLAP is used for calculation of the structure functions of the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), \u2212Q2 is the\nvirtuality of the photon. The dependence of \u03b1s given by Eqs (1,2) follows from the results of ref. [2] for the treatment\nof \u03b1s in hard QCD processes. On the other hand, some important high energy QCD processes are Regge-like, rather\nthan hard. In particular, high energy forward and backward scattering and DIS at small x are typical Regge-like\nprocesses. The use of the hard -like prescription [2] of the QCD coupling for these Regge processes should have been\njustified somehow. Indeed, much recent work uses the argument of \u03b1s given by Eqs. (1, 2) without any comments. For\nexample, in ref [3] Eq. (1) is used for incorporating running \u03b1s into the BFKL equation though it is well-known that\nthe BFKL is constructed especially for the Regge kinematics. Also, works [4] suggest \u03b1s = \u03b1s (Q2 ) for the polarised\nDIS structure function g1 at small x. On the other hand, instead of exploiting directly Eq. (1) refs [5], [6] prescribe a\nmodified parametrisation of \u03b1s , namely\n2\n\u03b1s = \u03b1s (k\u22a5\n/\u03b2),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the parameter of the standard Sudakov representation of the ladder momentum k 1 :\nk\u03bc = \u03b1q\u03bc + \u03b2p\u03bc + k\u22a5\u03bc .\n\n(4)\n\nContrary to refs. [1] - [6], we have suggested [7] a quite different treatment of \u03b1s in the evolution equations for the\nnon-singlet structure functions at small x. It is interesting that when the argument of \u03b1s is discussed in ref [8], the\nfirst assumptions about the argument look similar to Eqs. (1) though final result agrees rather with [7] than with\n\n1\n\nmomenta p and q must obey 2pq \u226b p2 \u223c q 2 \u223c 0, otherwise they are arbitrary\n\n1\n\n\fEq. (1). In the present work we extend the treatment of \u03b1s suggested in [7] for the non-singlet structure functions,\nwhich are based on a quark ladder, to the the more complicated case of gluon ladders, forming the base for the singlet\nstructure functions of DIS. We show that the treatment of \u03b1s suggested in refs. [2] for hard processes and often used\nsubsequently for description of different high energy QCD processes is an approximation valid only for hard QCD\nprocesses. This treatment cannot be used for the Regge kinematics. We show that the \u03b1s -dependence given by\nEq. (1) is valid only for hard QCD processes where values of all Mandelstam variables are of the same order. In\nparticular, for DIS it means that \u03b1s = \u03b1s (Q2 ) (or \u03b1s (k 2 )) in evolution equations only when x \u223c 1. On the contrary,\nthe treatment of \u03b1s of Ref. [7] is valid for the evolution of DIS structure functions at small x and for other high\nenergy QCD processes in the Regge kinematics. The paper is organised as follows: in sect 2 we discuss the treatment\nof \u03b1s in elementary parton processes. In sect. 3 we extend it to partonic ladders in the Regge kinematics and compare\nour results with results those of ref. [2]. Finally, sect. 4 contains our concluding remarks.\nII. INCORPORATING RUNNING \u03b1S INTO THE BORN SCATTERING AMPLITUDES\n\nIn this section we discuss the argument of \u03b1s in elementary parton processes. In order to avoid unnecessary\ncomplications we regard all these partons as slightly off-shell. We specify this fact explicitly in Eq. (14). Let us\nconsider first the scattering amplitude Mqq for the process of annihilation of a quark- antiquark pair into a quark\n-antiquark pair of the same flavour:\nq(p1 ) + q\u0304(p2 ) \u2192 q(p\u20321 ) + q\u0304(p\u20322 )\n\n(5)\n\ns = (p1 + p2 )2 \u2248 \u2212u = (p\u20322 \u2212 p1 )2 \u226b \u2212t = \u2212(p\u20321 \u2212 p1 )2 .\n\n(6)\n\nin the forward kinematical region\n\nBorn\nis given by contributions of three Feynman graphs. In each such graph the\nIn the Born approximation Mqq\nintermediate gluon has momentum k, so that either k 2 = s or k 2 = u or at last k 2 = t. Such intermediate gluons are\noften addressed as s, u or t -channel gluons respectively.\nAccording to the Optical theorem\n\n\u03c3tot \u223c s\u22121 Is M|t=0 ,\n\n(7)\n\nBorn\nso only the graph with an intermediate s -channel gluon in Mqq\ncontributes to the total cross section of the process.\nBorn\n. Adding the\nAs our final goal is cross sections, we consider only this graph and denote its contribution by M\u0303qq\nBorn\nBorn\npart of radiative corrections to M\u0303qq\nwhich makes \u03b1s running M\u0303qq\ntransforms into\n\nM\u0303qq = \u22124\u03c0\u03b1s (s)\n\n\u016b( p2 )\u03b3\u03bc u(p1 )\u016b( p2 )\u03b3\u03bc u(p1 )\n.\ns + \u0131\u01eb\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1s depends on s. In Eq. (8), we have dropped the factor 4\u03c0 and the colour structure. The Feynman graphs\ncorresponding to M\u0303qq are depicted in Fig. 1. The well-known BLM [9] arguments allow one to consider only quark\nloop contributions to \u03b1s and it is easy to show that the argument of \u03b1s in Eq. (8) is indeed s. To this end let us note\nfirst that at high energies and for space-like q obeying\n\u039b2 \u2261 \u039b2QCD << \u2212q 2\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b1s is given by\n\u03b1s (q 2 ) =\n\n1\n,\nb ln(\u2212q 2 /\u039b2 )\n\nb = (11N \u2212 2nf )/(12\u03c0) .\n\n(10)\n\nAs is well-known, in Eq. (10) the contribution proportional to the number of colours, N comes from graphs with\ngluon loops whereas the contribution proportional to nf comes from the QED -like graphs where the gluon propagator\nis saturated only by quark loops. Obviously, the main, logarithmic contribution of quark loops is proportional to ln(s).\nAs eventually quark and gluon loop contributions combine into Eq. (10), the argument of \u03b1s in Eq. (8) is indeed s.\nNow let us repeat the above reasoning, replacing the quarks by gluons, i.e. let us consider the forward scattering\nprocess\n\n2\n\n\fg(p1 ) + g(p2 ) \u2192 g(p\u20321 ) + g(p\u20322 )\n\n(11)\n\nBorn\nin the forward region Eq. (6). We denote the Born amplitude for the forward scattering of gluons by Mgg\nand,\nsimilarly to Eq. (8), denote the Born approximation for the part of the forward amplitude with s -channel intermediate\nBorn\ngluon by M\u0303gg\n(see Fig. 2). As is well-known, the Slavnov-Taylor [10] identities state that accounting for radiative\nBorn\ncorrections to M\u0303gg\nlead to the same dependency, \u03b1s = \u03b1s (s). Therefore both for the quark and gluon scattering,\nadding radiative corrections to the part of the Born scattering amplitude with an s -channel gluon transforms it into\n\nM\u0303 = \u22124\u03c0\u03b1s (s)\n\nR(s)\ns + \u0131\u01eb\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we have dropped the color factors. R includes vertices and spin dependence. For example, for the scattering\nof on-shell quarks, R(s) = Rq (s) = 2s. For the gluon scattering, R = Rg depends on polarisations of gluons. We\nconsider only its part, M\u0303 , with s -channel gluon, instead of the whole scattering amplitude M , disregarding parts of\nM with the t and u -channel gluons because only M\u0303 has non-zero imaginary part with respect to s. Eq. (12) than\nleads to\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u03c0R(s)\n+ R\u03b1s (s)\u03c0\u03b4(s)(4\u03c0R(s))\n(13)\nIs M \u2261 IM\u0303 = \u2212I\u03b1s (s)\ns\nwhere we have used IR(s) = 0. We remind the reader that throughout this paper we assume all partons to be slightly\noff-shell. For the on-shell quarks, the second term in the rhs of Eq. (13) is zero. It is easy to see that \u03b1s (s), given by\nEq. (10) when its argument is space-like, can be rewritten as\n\u03b1s (s) =\n\n1\nln(s/\u039b2 ) + \u0131\u03c0\n,\n=\nb ln(\u2212s/\u039b2 )\nb[ln2 (s/\u039b2 ) + \u03c0 2 ]\n\n(14)\n\nwhen s is time-like. Indeed, any scattering amplitude M (s) has a non-zero imaginary part in s when s is positive. In\nparticular when M depends on s through logarithms, it means that\nM = M (ln(\u2212s))\n\n(15)\n\nwhen s is positive. However, Eq. (15) does not fix the phase of \u2212s = se\u0131\u03c6 . In order to fix \u03c6, one can use the fact that\nM does not have an imaginary part when s is negative. Then, the analytical continuation of M from positive s to\nnegative s is defined through the upper path, because the cut in the s -plane when s > 0. In doing so, s acquires the\nfactor e\u0131\u03c0 leading to \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0. Thus, instead of Eq. (15) one has\nM = M (ln(s) \u2212 \u0131\u03c0)\nwhen s is positive. Combining now Eq. (13) and Eq. (14), we obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\n4\u03c0 2 R(s)\n1\n2\nIM\u0303 =\nln(s/\u039b\n)\u03b4(s)\n\u2212\n.\ns\nb[ln2 (s/\u039b2 ) + \u03c0 2 ]\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nTaking Is M corresponds to cutting all intermediate states in the s -channel and summing up such contributions.\nThe first term in the squared brackets in Eq. (17) corresponds to the case when the s -channel intermediate state is\nan on-shell gluon whereas the second term corresponds to many on-shell partons in the intermediate state. Using the\n\u03b4-function in Eq. (17) when integrating the first term over s leads to a result which is singular in the infrared region.\nThe reason for that is obvious: one can apply Eq. (10) for \u03b1s (s) only when s \u226b \u039b2 . In order to fix this we replace\n\u03b4(s) by \u03b4(s \u2212 \u03bc2 ) in Eq. (12), with the infrared cut-off \u03bc \u226b \u039b, arriving therefore at the expression\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4\u03c0 2 R(s)\n1\n2\n2\n(18)\nIM\u0303 =\nln(s/\u039b\n)\u03b4(s\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n)\n\u2212\ns\nb[ln2 (s/\u039b2 ) + \u03c0 2 ]\nfor s -channel imaginary part of Mqq and Mgg .\nFinally let us consider the quark -gluon scattering, with both gluons off-shell, k 2 = (k \u2032 )2 < 0 :\nq(p) + g(k) \u2192 q(p\u2032 ) + g(k \u2032 )\n\n3\n\n(19)\n\n\fin the forward region (6). In the Born approximation the only Feynman graph with non-zero imaginary part in s is\ndepicted in Fig. 3. Incorporating the radiative corrections to this graph in the same way as was done for quark-quark\nand gluon-gluon scattering and using the BLM approach [9], we conclude that for qg- scattering\n\u03b1s = \u03b1s (k 2 ) ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhich agrees with the treatment of \u03b1s suggested in ref. [2]. Obviously, Is \u03b1s (k 2 ) = 0 and therefore\n4\u03c0 2 R(s)\n\u03b4(s \u2212 \u03bc2 )\nIM \u0303qg =\nb ln(s/\u039b2 )\n\n(21)\n\ninstead of Eq. (18).\nIII. QCD COUPLINGS IN LADDER GRAPHS\n\nNow let us allow all partons in Eqs. (5),(11) and (19) to be off-shell so that their virtualities cannot be neglected. It\nis obvious that letting the on-shell partons which were considered in sect. 2 be off-shell does not change our conclusions\nconcerning the argument of \u03b1s in these scattering processes. Our formulae Eqs. (18),(21) also remain valid for off-shell\nparton scattering, save a change of R . However, letting the partons be off-shell converts the amplitudes we have\nconsidered into the rungs of partonic ladder graphs. Therefore we conclude that incorporating the running QCD\ncoupling into the gluon-gluon and quark-quark rungs fixes the time-like virtuality of the intermediate s -channel gluon\n(the horizontal gluon line in Figs. 1-4) as the scale of \u03b1s . In contrast to this, the scale of \u03b1s for the quark-gluon and\ngluon-quark rungs is the space-like virtuality of the vertical gluon lines.\nTherefore the integrand of the quark ladder depicted in Fig. 4 contains n + 1 QCD couplings in such a way:\n\u03b1s ((p1 \u2212 k1 )2 )\u03b1s ((k1 \u2212 k2 )2 )\u03b1s ((k2 \u2212 k3 )2 )....\u03b1s ((p2 + kn )2 ) .\n\n(22)\n\nWhen quark lines in Fig. 4 are replaced by the gluon lines, the integrand of such purely gluon ladder (we keep the\nsame notations for the gluon ladder momenta as for the quark ones) contains the same succession of QCD couplings\nwith the same arguments as Eq. (22). However, some interesting objects (e.g. for the singlet DIS structure function\ng1 ) are made of mixing of the quark and gluon rungs as shown in Fig. 5, so that the integrand corresponding to Fig. 5\nis proportional to\n\u03b1s (k12 )\u03b1s ((k1\u2032 )2 )\u03b1s ((k3 \u2212 k4 )2 ) . . . \u03b1s (kn2 )\u03b12s ((kn\u2032 )2 )\n\n(23)\n\ninstead of the DGLAP succession2\n\u03b1s (k12 )\u03b1s (k22 )\u03b1s (k32 )....\u03b12s (kn2 ) .\n\n(24)\n\nA further difference concerning treatment of \u03b1s arises when those ladders are used for calculation of cross sections\n(e.g. DIS structure functions), which contain the imaginary part, Is A of these ladders: as all s -channel gluons\n(the horizontal lines in Fig. 5) are time-like, the related \u03b1s have non-zero Is \u03b1s too. Accounting for them makes the\npattern much more complicated than the standard DGLAP approach.\nLadder graphs incorporating all orders in \u03b1s are essential ingredient of the DIS structure functions. We demonstrate\nnow how and when it is possible to justify the DGLAP-like argument (1) of \u03b1s for them. To this aim let us suppose\nthat some DIS structure function \u03a6 obeys a Bethe-Salpeter equation. The part of this equation involving the s\n-channel cut of the ladder virtual gluon is represented by the graph in Fig. 6. For example, it corresponds to the\nDGLAP equation or (after replacing the photon lines in Fig. 6 by gluon ones) - to the first term of the BFKL equation\nwith running \u03b1s . After simplification of the spin structure, its contribution, \u03a6(s, Q2 ) can be written as follows :\nZ\n2\nd4 k \u03a6((q + k)2 , Q2 , k 2 ) 4k\u22a5\n\u03b1s ((p \u2212 k)2 )\n2\n2\n\u03a6(s, Q ) = (p + q)\nI\n4\u03c0\n(25)\ns\n(2\u03c0)4\n(k 2 )2 (q + k)2\n(p \u2212 k)2\nwhere we have used the standard notations: q stands for the virtual photon momentum, Q2 = \u2212q 2 > 0 and k\u22a5 is\ntransverse to the plane formed by q and p. The intermediate partons with momenta k in Fig. 6 can be either quarks\n\n2\n\nfor the ladder parton momenta ki2 \u2248 \u2212ki2 \u22a5\n\n4\n\n\for gluons. The external parton with momentum p is assumed to be on-shell and we will neglect its virtuality, which is\nnot important for our conclusions. As we are discussing the treatment of \u03b1s , we have dropped unessential numerical\nfactors from rhs of Eq. (25) and have used the same notation \u03a6 both for the on-shell structure function in the lhs\nof Eq. (25) and for the off-shell one in the rhs. \u03a6 is supposed to be a logarithmic function of s. In contrast to the\nconventional DGLAP or BFKL cases, the rhs of Eq. (25) contains I\u03b1s instead of \u03b1s . Also, the argument of \u03b1s is the\nvirtuality of the horizontal gluon. However under certain conditions, one can rewrite Eq. (25) in the form containing\n2\n\u03b1s with the DGLAP argument k\u22a5\n. To show this let us use the Sudakov representation for k\nk\u03bc = \u03b1(q + xp)\u03bc + \u03b2p\u03bc + k\u22a5\u03bc .\n\n(26)\n\nwhere x = Q2 /s, s \u2261 2pq, and then introduce the virtuality m2 = (p \u2212 k)2 of the s -channel gluon as a new variable\n2\n2\ninstead of \u03b1. As k 2 = \u2212(\u03b2m2 + k\u22a5\n)/(1 \u2212 \u03b2), (q + k)2 = [(\u03b2 \u2212 x)[s(1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u2212 m2 ] \u2212 k\u22a5\n(1 \u2212 x)]/(1 \u2212 \u03b2), we arrive at\nZ\n\u0010 [(\u03b2 \u2212 x)[s(1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u2212 m2 ] \u2212 k 2 (1 \u2212 x)]\n2\nk\u22a5\n1\n2\n\u22a5\n\u03a6\n,\ndk\u22a5\nd\u03b2dm2\n\u03a6(s, Q2 ) = 2\n2 ]2\n\u03c0\n[\u03b2m2 + k\u22a5\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)\n2 \u0011\ns(1 \u2212 \u03b2)2\n\u03b1s (m2 )\n(\u03b2m2 + k\u22a5\n)\n.\n(27)\nIs\nQ2 ,\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)\n[(\u03b2 \u2212 x)[s(1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u2212 m ] \u2212 k\u22a5 (1 \u2212 x)]\nm2\nThe integration over \u03b2 is supposed to yield logarithmic contributions. It is necessary for BFKL and important also\nfor DGLAP when applied in the small- x region. To this accuracy the integration over \u03b2 in Eq. (27) can be written\nas d\u03b2/\u03b2, the main contribution coming from the region\n1 \u226b \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2min ,\n\n(28)\n\nwith\n\u03b2min = x +\n\n2\nk\u22a5\n(1 \u2212 x)\ns \u2212 m2\n\nas the lowest limit of the integration. Therefore Eq. (27) becomes\nZ\nZ \u221e\nZ 1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nd\u03b2 \u221e\n2\n2\n\u03a6\u2248 2\ndm2 \u03a6 \u03b2(s \u2212 m2 ) \u2212 k\u22a5\n(1 \u2212 x), Q2 , (\u03b2m2 + k\u22a5\n)\nd2 k\u22a5\n\u03c0 0\n0\n\u03b2min \u03b2\n\u0010 \u03b1 (m2 ) \u0011\n2\nk\u22a5\ns\ns\nI\n.\n2\n(s \u2212 m2 ) [\u03b2m2 + k\u22a5 ]2\nm2\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nWhen the dependence of \u03b2min and \u03a6 upon m2 in the rhs of Eq. (30) can be neglected, one can interpret the\nintegration over m2 as a dispersion integral for \u03b1s :\nZ\n\u0010 \u03b1 (m2 ) \u0011\n2\nk\u22a5\n1 \u221e\ns\nI\ndm2\n\u2248\n2 ]2\n\u03c0 0\n[\u03b2m2 + k\u22a5\nm2\nZ\n\u0010 \u03b1 (m2 ) \u0011 \u03b1 (\u2212k 2 /\u03b2)\n1 \u221e\n1\ns\ns\n\u22a5\n\u2248\nI\n.\n(31)\ndm2\n2]\n2\n\u03c0 0\n[\u03b2m2 + k\u22a5\nm2\nk\u22a5\nleading to an explicit \u03b1s dependence. In particular this is possible when \u03a6 in the integrand of Eq. (30) does not\ndepend on k 2 and when x is big enough to satisfy\n2\n\u03b2min \u2248 x \u226b k\u22a5\n(1 \u2212 x)/s.\n\n(32)\n\nTherefore the argument m2 of \u03b1s in this kinematical condition is\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 k\u22a5\n/x \u2264 m2 = \u2212k\u22a5\n/\u03b2 \u2264 \u2212k\u22a5\n\n(33)\n\n2\nThen the integration over \u03b2 is in the region x \u2264 \u03b2 \u226a 1 and Eq. (32) is equivalent to the condition k\u22a5\n(1 \u2212 x) < sx =\n2\nQ which is exactly the DGLAP region. According to Eq. (32), as x must not be small, the dependence \u03b1s \u2248 \u03b1s (k\u22a5\n)\nof Eq. (33) actually coincides with the parametrisation suggested in Ref [2].\nOn the other hand, when x \u2192 0, \u03b2min depends on m2 :\n2\n\n\u03b2min \u2248\n\n2\nk\u22a5\ns \u2212 m2\n\n5\n\n(34)\n\n\fand, as well known, \u03a6 in the rhs of Eq. (30) depends on k 2 . This makes impossible the use of Eq. (31) for performing\n2\nthe integration over m2 . However, to the leading logarithmic accuracy, when m2 \u226a s and |k 2 | \u2248 k\u22a5\n\u226b \u03b2m2 , one can\nstill perform the integration in Eq. (31), without using the dispersion relation, as:\nZ\n\u0010 \u03b1 (m2 ) \u0011\n2\n1\nk\u22a5\n1 \u221e\ns\n\u2248 2 R,\nI\ndm2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c0 0\n[\u03b2m + k\u22a5 ]\nm\nk\u22a5\n2\n2\nZ k\u22a5\nZ ln(k\u22a5\n/\u03b2\n/\u03b2\u039b2 )\n2\n1\ndm\ndz\n1\nI\u03b1s (m2 ) =\n(35)\nR\u2261\n\u03c0 \u039b2\nm2\nb 0\nz 2 + \u03c02\nwhere we have used Eq. (14) for I\u03b1s . Let us note that, contrary to Eq. (31), the argument of \u03b1s in Eq. (35) is\ntime-like. Introducing the infrared cutoff \u03bc2 we arrive at the result\n1\n\u03a6\u2248\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u03bc2 /s\n\nd\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\nZ\n\ns\u03b2\n\n\u03bc2\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\ndk\u22a5\n2\n2\nR(k\u22a5\n/\u03b2)\n\u03a6 \u03b2, Q2 , k\u22a5\n2\nk\u22a5\n\n(36)\n\nfor x \u2192 0, which actually reproduces the first term of the BFKL for the case when the gluon with momentum\n2\np is (nearly) on-shell. When \u03c0 2 is dropped, the integration in Eq. (35) yields R = \u03b1s (k\u22a5\n/\u03b2) 3 , otherwise R =\n2\n(1/\u03c0b) arctan[ln(k\u22a5\n/\u03b2\u039b2 )/\u03c0] .\nEq. (36) shows that one cannot drop the dependence on \u03b2 in R. In other words, there is no factorization between\nthe dependence on the logitudinal and transverse momenta at small x.\nA simple way to solve such equations (and Eq. (25) in particular) is known from the Regge theory (see e.g.\n[11]). The point is that the small- x region is actually the Regge kinematical region where one can use the Mellin\ntransform to simplify equations similar to Eq. (25). However, first one should introduce the signature amplitudes\nM (\u00b1) = [M (s, Q2 ) \u00b1 M (\u2212s, Q2 )]/2 so that the structure functions are proportional to (1/\u03c0)Is M (\u00b1) . Then one can\nuse the Sommerfeld-Watson transform in the asymptotical form:\nZ \u0131\u221e\nd\u03c9 \u0010 s \u0011\u03c9 (\u00b1)\nM (\u00b1) (s/m2 ) =\n\u03be (\u03c9)F (\u00b1) (\u03c9) ,\n(37)\n2\n2\u03c0\u0131\nm\n\u2212\u0131\u221e\nwhere \u03be (\u00b1) = (e\u2212\u0131\u03c0\u03c9 \u00b1 1)/2 are the signature factors well-known from the Regge theory. Although the transform (37)\nlooks similar to the Mellin transform, actually there is a certain difference between them. Indeed, contrary to the\nusual Mellin transform, the transform inverse to (37) involves Is M (\u00b1) :\nZ \u221e\n\u22122\nF (\u00b1) (\u03c9) =\nd(s/m2 )(s/m2 )\u22121\u2212\u03c9 Is M (\u00b1) (s/m2 ) .\n(38)\nsin(\u03c0\u03c9) 0\nThis method can be easily used to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation (25), with the argument of I\u03b1s being time-like.\nAn application of this method has been given in [7] for calculating the nonsinglet structure functions at small x. The\n2\nfact that one cannot use the parametrisation \u03b1s = \u03b1s (k\u22a5\n) for the DIS structure functions at small x suggests in\nparticular that in the generalisation of the BFKL equation, when accounting for running \u03b1s effects, the first term of\n2\n2\nthe new kernel should contain \u03b1s with the time-like argument k\u22a5\n/\u03b2 (at least in the region where k\u22a5\n/\u03b2 dominates\nover the virtualities of the external gluons) whereas in the second term (corresponding to the virtual contribution) \u03b1s\n2\nhas the space-like argument k\u22a5\n. We will consider the running \u03b1s effects for the BFKL in a forthcoming publication.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n2\nWe have shown that when \u03b1s is running in a general QCD process, providing \u03b1s with the argument k\u22a5\nis not a\ngeneral rule but an approximation. This approximation is valid for hard processes but fails for the Regge-like ones.\nIt can be used in the DGLAP evolution equations when they are applied in the kinematical region of large x but\ncannot be used at small x. In this regime we have suggested, for both the quark-quark and the gluon-gluon rungs\ninvolving I\u03b1s , that the argument should be the virtuality of the s -channel (horizontal) gluon. Being incorporated\n2\ninto evolution equations of the Bethe-Salpeter type, this leads to an effective coupling with the argument k\u22a5\n/\u03b2. When\n\n3\n\nA similar parameterization was used in Refs. [5], [6] for the non-singlet structure function.\n\n6\n\n\fthe virtuality of this gluon is time-like, \u03c0 2 -terms appear in expression for I\u03b1s (see Eqs. (17),(14)), due to the analytic\nproperties of \u03b1s . These \u03c0 2 -terms might be quite important because of their big numerical value. In particular, they\nhave an impact on the values of intercepts of the non-singlet DIS structure functions [7] and are likely to be important\nfor the singlet structure functions as well. However, when the starting point \u03bc0 of evolution is big enouph, \u03c0 2 -terms\ncan be easily neglected. It can be used for estimating \u03bc0 . In particular, we obtained [7] \u03bc0 \u2248 5GeV for the non-singlet\nstructure functions.\n\nV. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to G. Altarelli, M. Ciafaloini and D.A.
