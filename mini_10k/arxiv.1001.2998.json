We consider the scattering of time-harmonic electromagnetic\nplane waves with frequency \u03c9 > 0 by an impenetrable obstacle which is embedded in\na piecewise homogeneous medium. For simplicity, and without loss of generality, in\nthis paper we restrict ourself to the case where the obstacle is buried in a two-layered\npiecewise homogeneous medium, as shown in Figure 1.1. Note that our method and\nresults can be easily extended to the multi-layered case. Precisely, let \u03a92 \u2282 R3 denote\nthe impenetrable obstacle which is an open bounded region with a C 2 boundary S1\nand let R3 \\\u03a92 denote the the background medium which is divided by means of a\nclosed C 2,\u03b1 (0 < \u03b1 < 1) surface S0 into two connected domains \u03a90 and \u03a91 . Let \u03a9\ndenote the complement of \u03a90 , that is, \u03a9 := R3 \\\u03a90 . We assume that the boundary S1\nof the obstacle \u03a92 has a dissection S1 = \u03931 \u222a \u03932 , where \u03931 and \u03932 are two disjoint,\nrelatively open subsets of S1 .\nThe electromagnetic properties of the homogeneous medium in \u03a90 are described\nby space independent electric permittivity \u01eb0 > 0, magnetic permeability \u03bc0 > 0\nand vanishing electric conductivity \u03c30 = 0. The electromagnetic properties of the\nhomogeneous medium in \u03a91 are determined by space independent electric permittivity\n\u01eb1 > 0, magnetic permeability \u03bc1 > 0 and electric conductivity \u03c31 \u2265 0. We define\nthe wave number kj in the corresponding medium \u03a9j by kj2 = (\u01ebj + i\u03c3j /\u03c9)\u03bcj \u03c9 2 with\nRkj > 0, Ikj \u2265 0 (j = 0, 1).\nFor convenience we denote by T (Sj ) and T 0,\u03b1 (Sj ) (j = 0, 1), 0 < \u03b1 < 1, the\nspaces of all continuous and uniformly H\u00f6lder continuous tangential fields equipped\nwith the supremum norm and the H\u00f6lder norm, respectively. Then we introduce the\nnormed spaces of tangential fields possessing a surface divergence (see section 6.3 in\n\u2217 LSEC and Institute of Applied Mathematics, AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing\n100190, China (lxd230@163.com).\n\u2020 LSEC and Institute of Applied Mathematics, AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing\n100190, China (b.zhang@amt.ac.cn).\n\u2021 LSEC and Institute of Applied Mathematics, AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing\n100190, China (jiaqingyang@amss.ac.cn).\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nX.

We denote by \u03bd(x) the unit normal vector to a surface at the point x. For a\nclosed surface it is directed into the exterior of the surface. For two vectors a, b \u2208 C3\nwe write a * b for the scalar product and a \u00d7 b for the vector product.\nGiven four tangential fields T1 , T2 \u2208 Td0,\u03b1 (S0 ), T3 \u2208 Td0,\u03b1 (\u03931 ) and T4 \u2208 T 0,\u03b1 (\u03932 ),\nthe direct problem consists in finding a solution E, H \u2208 C 1 (\u03a90 ) \u2229 C(\u03a90 ), F, G \u2208\nC 1 (\u03a91 ) \u2229 C(\u03a91 ) to the Maxwell equations\ncurl E \u2212 ik0 H = 0,\ncurl F \u2212 ik1 G = 0,\n\ncurl H + ik0 E = 0\ncurl G + ik1 F = 0\n\nin \u03a90 ,\nin \u03a91 ,\n\n(1.1)\n(1.2)\n\nwhich satisfies the Silver-M\u00fcller radiation condition\nlim (H \u00d7 x \u2212 rE) = 0\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere r = |x| and the limit holds uniformly in all directions x/r, the transmission\nboundary conditions\n\u03bd \u00d7 E \u2212 \u03bbE \u03bd \u00d7 F = T1 ,\nwith constants \u03bbE and \u03bbH\nboundary condition\n\n\u03bd \u00d7 H \u2212 \u03bbH \u03bd \u00d7 G = T2\non S0\n(1.4)\np\np\ngiven by \u03bbE = \u01eb0 /(\u01eb1 + i\u03c31 /\u03c9), \u03bbH = \u03bc0 /\u03bc1 , and the\nB(F ) = 0\n\non S1\n\n\fInverse scattering in a piecewise homogeneous medium\n\n3\n\nwith the operator B depending on the nature of the obstacle \u03a92 . Precisely, the\nboundary condition on S1 is understood as:\n\u03bd \u00d7 F = T3\n\u03bb\n\u03bd \u00d7 G \u2212 (\u03bd \u00d7 F ) \u00d7 \u03bd = T4\nk1\n\non \u03931 ,\n\n(1.5)\n\non \u03932 .\n\n(1.6)\n\nwith a positive constant \u03bb. Note that the case \u03932 = \u2205 corresponds to a perfectly\nconducting obstacle and the case \u03931 = \u2205 leads to an impedance boundary condition\ncorresponding to an obstacle which is not perfectly conducting but does not allow the\nelectromagnetic wave to penetrate deeply into the obstacle. The scattering problems\nwith mixed boundary conditions widely occur in practical applications, e.g., in the\nuse of electromagnetic waves to detect \"hostile\" objects where the boundary, or more\ngenerally a portion of the boundary, is coated with an unknown material in order\nto avoid detection. We refer to [3, 5, 6] for the physical relevance and practical\nimplication of the electromagnetic scattering by obstacles with a mixed boundary\ncondition in a homogeneous medium.\nIn the next section, an integral equation method is employed to establish the\nwell-posedness of the direct problem. A mixed reciprocity relation will also be proved.\nThese results will play an important role in the proof of the uniqueness results in the\ninverse problem.\nThe radiation condition (1.3) ensures uniqueness of solutions to the exterior\nboundary value problem and leads to an asymptotic behavior of the form\nE(x) =\n\neik0 |x|\n|x|\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\nE \u221e (b\nx) + O( ) ,\n|x|\n\nas |x| \u2192 \u221e\n\n(1.7)\n\nuniformly in all directions x\nb = x/|x|, where the vector field E \u221e defined on the unit\n2\nsphere S is known as the electric far field pattern.\nWe consider the scattering of electromagnetic plane waves\ni\ncurl curl qeik0 x*d = ik0 (d \u00d7 q) \u00d7 deik0 x*d ,\nk0\nH i (x, d, q) = curl qeik0 x*d = ik0 d \u00d7 qeik0 x*d\nE i (x, d, q) =\n\nwhere the unit vector d describes the direction of propagation and the constant vector\nq gives the polarization. Then we have T1 = \u2212\u03bd \u00d7 E i (x, d, q), T2 = \u2212\u03bd \u00d7 H i (x, d, q) on\nS0 , T3 = 0 on \u03931 and T4 = 0 on \u03932 in the boundary problem (1.1)-(1.6). Throughout\nthis paper, we will indicate the dependence of the corresponding scattered field, total\nfield and far field pattern on the incident direction d and the polarization q by writing\nE s (*, d, q), H s (*, d, q), E(*, d, q), H(*, d, q) and E \u221e (*, d, q), H \u221e (*, d, q), respectively.\nThe inverse problem we consider in this paper is, given the wave numbers\nkj (j = 0, 1), the constants \u03bbE and \u03bbH and the electric far field pattern E \u221e (b\nx, d, q)\nfor all observation directions x\nb \u2208 S 2 , all incident directions d \u2208 S 2 and all polarizations\nq \u2208 R3 , to determine the interface S0 and the obstacle \u03a92 with its physical property\nB. As usual in most of the inverse problems, the first question to ask in this context\nis the identifiability, i.e. whether an obstacle can be identified from knowledge of its\nfar-field pattern. Mathematically, the identifiability is the uniqueness issue which is of\ntheoretical interest and is required in order to proceed to efficient numerical methods\nof solutions.\n\n\f4\n\nX. LIU, B. ZHANG & J. YANG\n\nFor scattering problems in a homogeneous medium, there has been an extensive\nstudy in the literature; see, e.g., uniqueness results for scattering from a perfect\nconductor by Colton & Kress [8], for scattering from an impenetrable obstacle with the\nboundary condition (1.6) by Kress [17], for scattering from a penetrable obstacle with\ntransmission boundary conditions by H\u00e4hner [11] and for scattering from a penetrable\nobstacle with conductivity boundary conditions by Hettlich [9]. However, few results\nare available for the case of a piecewise homogeneous background medium. For the\nscalar Helmholtz equation, uniqueness results have been investigated in our recent\npaper [21]. Motivated by Isakov's paper [12], Kirsch & Kress [14] gave another proof\nof the unique determination of a penetrable obstacle in a homogeneous medium for\nthe scalar transmission problem. Based on their ideas, H\u00e4hner proved the unique\ndetermination of the penetrable obstacle in the electromagnetic scattering using a\nnovel method. In this paper, we will use H\u00e4hner's method to prove that the interface\nS0 is uniquely determined from the electric far field patterns in Section 3. Under the\ncondition that the wave numbers in the innermost and outermost homogeneous layers\ncoincide, that is, k0 = k1 in the Maxwell equations (1.1)-(1.2) and S0 is known in\nadvance, we have proved in [20] that the obstacle with its physical property can be\nuniquely determined. A main tool used and established in [20] is a mixed reciprocity\nrelation which is important in the proof of the uniqueness result. In this paper,\nwe establish a modified mixed reciprocity relation (cf. Lemma 2.5 in [22] for the\nacoustic scattering). Based on this result, we will prove the unique determination of\nthe obstacle \u03a92 and its physical property B in Section 4.\n2. The direct scattering problem. We first show that the direct scattering\nproblem has a unique solution.\nTheorem 2.1. The boundary value problem (1.1) \u2212 (1.6) admits at most one\nsolution.\nProof. Clearly, it is enough to show that E = H = 0 in \u03a90 , F = G = 0 in \u03a91 for\nthe corresponding homogeneous problem, that is, T1 = T2 = 0 on S0 , T3 = 0 on \u03931\nand T4 = 0 on \u03932 .

Hence, by the relations (2.19) and (2.20), we conclude\n[15] imply that E\nthat a = b = 0 on S0 , which completes the proof.\nAs incident fields E i , besides the electromagnetic plane waves we are also interested in the electromagnetic field of an electric dipole with polarization p which is\ngiven by\nE i (x; zj , p) =\n\ni\ncurlcurl (p\u03a6(x, zj )), H i (x; zj , p) = curl (p\u03a6j (x, zj ))\nkj\n\n(2.25)\n\nlocated at the point zj \u2208 \u03a9j for x 6= zj (j = 0, 1). For j = 0, 1, denote by E(*; zj , p)\nand H(*; zj , p) the corresponding total waves, by E s (*; zj , p) and H s (*; zj , p) the scattered waves and by E \u221e (*; zj , p) and H \u221e (*; zj , p) the corresponding far field patterns,\nindicating the dependence on the location zj and polarization p of the electric dipole.\nRemark 2.3. In the case when the incident field is given by the electric dipole\nE i (x; z0 , p), H i (x; z0 , p) located at z0 \u2208 \u03a90 , we have E = E s (x; z0 , p), T1 = \u2212\u03bd \u00d7\nE i (x; z0 , p), T2 = \u2212\u03bd \u00d7 H i (x; z0 , p), T3 = 0 and T4 = 0 in the boundary value\nproblem (1.1) \u2212 (1.6). In the case when the incident field is given by the electric\ndipole E i (x; z1 , p), H i (x; z1 , p) located at z1 \u2208 \u03a91 , we have E = E(x; z1 , p), T1 =\n\u03bbE \u03bd \u00d7 E i (x; z1 , p), T2 = \u03bbH \u03bd \u00d7 H i (x; z1 , p), T3 = \u2212\u03bd \u00d7 E i (x; z1 , p) and T4 = \u2212\u03bd \u00d7\nH i (x; z1 , p) + k\u03bb1 (\u03bd \u00d7 E i (x; z1 , p)) \u00d7 \u03bd in the boundary value problem (1.1) \u2212 (1.6).\nNote that in the last case E \u221e (*; z1 , p) is the electric far field pattern of the field\nE(x; z1 , p) = E s (x; z1 , p) for x \u2208 \u03a90 . This is different from our early work [20], where\nthe total field E(x; z1 , p) in \u03a90 is decomposed into the scattered field E s (x; z1 , p) and\nthe incident field E i (x; z1 , p), so E \u221e (*; z1 , p) is the electric far field pattern of the\nscattered field E s (x; z1 , p) rather than the total field E(x; z1 , p).\nWe now establish the following mixed reciprocity relation which is needed for the\ninverse problem.\nLemma 2.4. (Mixed reciprocity relation) For scattering of plane waves E i (x, d, q)\nand electric dipole E i (x; z, p) from the obstacle \u03a92 we have\n4\u03c0q * E \u221e (\u2212d; z0 , p) = p * E s (z0 , d, q),\n4\u03c0q * E \u221e (\u2212d; z1 , p) = \u03bbE \u03bbH p * F (z1 , d, q),\n\nz 0 \u2208 \u03a90 ,\nz 1 \u2208 \u03a91\n\nfor all incident directions d \u2208 S 2 and all polarizations p, q \u2208 R3 .\nProof.

Unique determination of the interface S0 . In this section we will assume\nthat Ik1 > 0. Denote by S0 and Se0 two different interfaces which yield the same elece \u221e (b\ntric far field patterns for all plane incoming waves, that is, E \u221e (b\nx, d, q) = E\nx, d, q)\n2\n3\ne\nf\nfor all x\nb, d \u2208 S , q \u2208 R .

Furthermore, The function Div [\u03bbH \u03bd \u00d7 Gn \u2212 \u03bd \u00d7 Hni ] = Div (\u03bd \u00d7 Hn ) is\nalso uniformly bounded in L2 (\u0393\u2217 )\u2212norm since Hn and its derivatives are uniformly\nbounded in B\u03b41 /2 .

Therefore, by Holmgren's uniqueness theorem [2, 15], F = G = 0 in \u03a91 . Using\nHolmgren's uniquness theorem again and with the help of the transmission boundary\nconditions, we conclude that E(x, d, q) = E i (x, d, q) + E s (x, d, q) = 0 in \u03a90 . The\nscattered field E s (x, d, q) tends to zero uniformly at infinity, while the incident plane\nwave E i (x, d, q) has modulus |k0 (d \u00d7 q) \u00d7 d| everywhere. Thus the modulus of the\ne\ntotal field tends to |k0 (d \u00d7 q) \u00d7 d|. This leads to a contradiction, giving that \u03bb = \u03bb.\nThe cases with other boundary conditions can be dealt with similarly.\nWe summarize the main results for the inverse problem in the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.4. Let Ik1 > 0. Then the interface S0 and the obstacle \u03a92 with\nits physical property B are uniquely determined by the electric far field patterns\nE \u221e (b\nx, d, q) for all observation directions x\nb \u2208 S 2 , all incident directions d \u2208 S 2 and\nall polarizations q \u2208 R3 .\nThere is a widespread belief that the electric far field pattern for a single incident\ndirection d \u2208 S 2 and a single polarization direction q uniquely determines the general\nobstacle, since the far field data depend on the same number of variables, as does the\nobstacle to be recovered. However, this result remains a challenging open problem [4].\nRecent progress has been made by Liu, Zhang & Zou [18] who established uniqueness\nwith a single incident wave for a polyhedral obstacle and by Kress [17] who proved that\na ball and its boundary condition (for constant impedance \u03bb) are uniquely determined\nby the far field pattern for one incident plane wave. In a recent paper [10], we\nproved uniqueness in determining a small perfectly conducting ball in the inverse\nelectromagnetic scattering problem by a finite number of electric far field patterns\nwith a single incident direction and polarization. We now extend Kress's result to our\ncase that the background is a piecewise homogeneous medium.\nCorollary 4.5. Let Ik1 > 0. Assume that the interface S0 and the boundary\nS1 are concentric spheres with center at the origin and the impedance \u03bb is a positive constant. Then they are uniquely determined by the electric far field patterns\nE \u221e (b\nx, d, q) for all observation directions x\nb \u2208 S 2 , one fixed incident direction d \u2208 S 2\n3\nand all polarizations q \u2208 R .\nProof. By symmetry, the electric far field pattern for scattering of plane waves\nby the concentric spheres S0 and S1 and the positive constant impedance \u03bb satisfies\nE \u221e (Qb\nx, Qd, Qq) = QE \u221e (b\nx, d, q) for all x\nb, d \u2208 S 2 , q \u2208 R3 and all rotations Q, that is,\nfor all orthogonal transformations with det Q = 1. Hence, knowledge of the electric\nfar field pattern for one incident direction implies knowledge of the electric far field\npattern for all incident directions. The statement now follows from Theorem 4.4.\nKarp's theorem in our case as stated in the following corollary is also true.\nCorollary 4.6. Let Ik1 > 0. Assume that the electric far field patterns\nE \u221e (b\nx, d, q) satisfies E \u221e (Qb\nx, Qd, Qq) = QE \u221e (b\nx, d, q) for all x\nb, d \u2208 S 2 , q \u2208 R3 and all\northogonal transformations Q with det Q = 1. Then the interface S0 and the boundary\nS1 are concentric spheres with center at the origin.\n\n\fInverse scattering in a piecewise homogeneous medium\n\n19\n\nProof. We define Se0 = Q(S0 ) and Se1 = Q(S1 ) for some orthogonal transformation\nQ with det Q = 1. Then, by symmetry the corresponding electric far field pattern\ne \u221e (b\nE\nx, d, q) for Se0 , Se1 satisfies\ne \u221e (b\nE\nx, d, q) = QE \u221e (Q\u22121 x\nb, Q\u22121 d, Q\u22121 q) = E \u221e (b\nx, d, q)\n\nfor all x\nb, d \u2208 S 2 , q \u2208 R3 . Theorem 4.4 implies that Se0 = S0 and Se1 = S1 . This holds\nfor all orthogonal transformations Q. Therefore S0 and S1 are concentric spheres with\ncenter at the origin.\nAcknowledgements.
