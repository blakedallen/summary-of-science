One of possible solutions is to\nmeasure the heat transfer along the helium surface [4].\nHowever, in this case, one has to use thin films to avoid\na giant-effective thermal conductance of a bulk liquid,\nwhich could easily mask the surface heat transfer. On\nthe other hand, in the case of films, an important role\nis played by the surface smoothness, as the ripplons can\nbe scattered not merely by phonons but also by surface\nimperfections caused by substrate defects (roughness).\nSuch a one-body elastic scattering of ripplons has a\nmuch weaker temperature dependence than the ripplonphonon interaction and therefore dominates at low\ntemperature [5]. Guaranteed exclusion of this one-body\nelastic channel of the ripplon flow dissipation imposes\nquite severe requirements on the surface smoothness\nover a large area. Thus, the contribution of the\nripplon-phonon processes to the thermal conductance\nof helium surface turns out to be barely detectable.\nRoche et al. [6] implemented capacitive excitation and\ndetection to measure the damping of long-wavelength\nripplons. However, this technique is hardly applicably\nfor studying thermal ripplons whose wavelength is just\n10 nm, i.e., three orders of magnitude shorter than in\nexperiments of Roche et al. In this work, we show that\nthe use of surface electrons might be very promising.\n\nLow-dimensional systems of charges have been\nstudied theoretically and experimentally for about four\ndecades. These systems include the two-dimensional\nelectron gas in semiconductor structures and the\nelectron systems localized above the surface of liquid\nhelium [1, 2]. The relaxation times of the excited spin\nor Rydberg states of surface electrons turn out to be\nmuch longer owing to a weak coupling to the helium\nsurface. This makes the surface electrons (SE) quite\nattractive as possible memory units of a quantum\ncomputer [3]. At the same time, the relative weakness\nof the relaxation mechanisms determines the ultimately\nhigh mobility \u03bc \u223c 104 m/V*s of the SEs, probably the\nhighest of all known two-dimensional systems.\nAt T < 0.7 K, when the saturation pressure of\nhelium vapor is exponentially small, the SE mobility\nis limited by their interaction with ripplons, the\nelementary excitations of the helium surface, whereas\nthe direct electron-phonon interaction is ineffective.\nAll previous theoretical and experimental works on the\nSE mobility assumed that the longitudinal momentum\nof the electrons transferred due to their interaction\nwith ripplons is immediately accumulated by the entire\nliquid (see, e.g., [1]. However, there are indications that\nin fact the relaxation of the longitudinal momentum of\nthe electrons proceeds in two stages, via the momentum\ntransfer to ripplons and further from the ripplons to\nthe phonons of the bulk liquid, and is limited by the\nslowest stage.\nGenerally speaking the experimental observation of\nthe ripplon-phonon interaction is a separate and quite\n\nThe surface (ripplons) and volume (phonons)\nquasiparticles of liquid helium interact only to the\nextent of a small compressibility of helium. The\nrate of the dominant process of momentum transfer\nat low temperatures (the phonon creation with the\nannihilation of two ripplons [7]) is proportional to\nT 20/3 [5]. Consequently, the ripplon subsystem in the\n\n1) safonov@isssph.kiae.ru\n\n\u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0432 \u0416\u042d\u0422\u0424\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. I. Safonov, I. I. Safonova and S. S. Demukh\n\nT \u2192 0 limit appears to be practically isolated from\nthe liquid bulk and has to follow the regular motion of\nthe electrons. Thus, the SE mobility should infinitely\nincrease with a decrease in temperature. However,\nnothing of that kind was observed in experiments\nat least down to 20 mK [8, 9]. On the contrary, the\nmobility of the electrons, which form a Wigner solid\n[10, 11] at low temperature, even somewhat decreases\nand levels off at T \u2192 0. This work is aimed at\nresolving this contradiction, finding the conditions,\nunder which the SE mobility is determined by the\nripplon-phonon interaction (or, at least, when the\nrespective contribution is considerable), and calculating\nthe dependence of the mobility on temperature, the\nfrequency \u03c9 of the driving electric field Ek (t) = Ek ei\u03c9t\nand the magnitude of the pressing field E\u22a5 .\nWe suggest that the said contradiction is caused by\nthe fact that the measurements are usually conducted\nin the ac regime at a relatively high frequency and that\nthe electron effective mass is several orders of magnitude\nless than that of ripplons. As a result, the amplitude\nof the in-plane oscillations of the ripplons subsystem\nis vanishingly small. A mechanical analogue of this\nsituation could be a small rubber on the surface of a\nmassive plate, which in turn lies on a smooth ice. The\nin-plane motion of the rubber driven by a periodic force\nis detected. It is intuitively clear that in order to observe\nthe joint motion of electrons and ripplons relative to the\nbulk liquid one has to perform the measurements in the\ndc regime or at a very small frequency. It is also clear\nthat one should aim at increasing the electron-to-ripplon\nratio of the effective mass densities.\nWe shall consider the ripplon and electron\nsubsystems separately. This requires that the\nequilibration time within each subsystem be\nsubstantially shorter than the relaxation time between\nthe subsystems. Next, we do not include the effect of\nthe transverse magnetic field, which is typically used in\nthe mobility measurement in the Corbino geometry but\nabsolutely insignificant for the present problem. The\namplitude Ek of the driving electric field is thought to\nbe sufficiently small so that the effects associated with\nthe electron overheating could be neglected. We also\ndisregard the boundary effects assuming the infiniteness\nof the two-dimensional system. Taking into account the\nabove remarks, the equations of motion of electrons\nand ripplons in the \u03c4 approximation read as\n\nand\n\neEk uR \u2212 ue\ndue\n=\u2212 \u2217 +\ndt\nm\n\u03c4e\n\n(1)\n\nuR\nuR \u2212 ue\nduR\n\u2212\n,\n= \u2212\u03b3\ndt\n\u03c4e\n\u03c4RP\n\n(2)\n\nrespectively. Here, ue (uR ) is the in-plane velocity of\nthe electron (ripplon) subsystem as a whole, e is the unit\ncharge, m\u2217 and ne are the the effective mass and number\ndensity of electrons, \u03c1R = 1.67\u00d710\u221210T 5/3 K\u22125/3 g/cm2\nis the mass density associated with ripplons, \u03b3 =\nne m\u2217 /\u03c1R is the electron-to-ripplon mass-density ratio.\nThe electron momentum-relaxation time \u03c4e is related\nto the SE mobility \u03bc with respect to ripplons as \u03c4e =\nm\u2217 \u03bc/e (see below) and weakly depends on temperature\nin the range under consideration. According to the\nexperimental data on the electron mobility [12] and\neffective mass [13], the electron-ripplon relaxation time\nat T = 70 \u00f7 80 mK and ns = 1.3 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 is\n\u03c4e \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22127 s. Thus, at T . 0.1 K the ripplon-phonon\nmomentum relaxation time \u03c4RP = 8.8\u00d710\u22129T \u22125 K5 s [5]\nis much greater than \u03c4e . Note, that the comprehensive\nkinetic calculation of \u03c4e for free electrons is also based on\nthe equilibrium of the electron and ripplon subsystem\n[1]. In particular, according to [1], the rate of electronelectron collisions in a typical experiment is much higher\nthan \u03c4e\u22121 .\nIn a weak pressing field E\u22a5 , the effective mass of\nelectrons almost coincides with their bare mass, m\u2217 \u2248\nm. In this case, the electrons appear to be orders of\nmagnitude \"lighter\" than the ripplons (\u03b3 \u226a 1) and the\nlatter do not feel the electron motion, uR \u226a ue . In this\ncase, Eq. (1) yields the usual expression for the electron\nmobility (to be compared with Eq. (10.7) of [1])\n\u03c4e\nRe ue \u0010 e \u0011\n.\n(3)\n=\n\u03bc\u2261\u2212\nEk\nm\u2217 1 + \u03c9 2 \u03c4e2\nAt not to high driving-field frequency \u03c9\u03c4e \u226a 1 (which\nis equivalent to neglecting the left-hand side of Eq. (1)),\nwe find \u03bc = e\u03c4e /m\u2217 [14].\nIn a strong pressing field the picture is substantially\nchanged. First of all, the maximum achievable electron\ndensity increases proportional to the pressing field,\nE\u22a5 = 2\u03c0enmax\n. In addition, the electron effective\ne\nmass as such increases by two or even three orders\nof magnitude. In particular, m\u2217 /m increases by from\n500 to 5000 nearly proportional to the square of the\npressing field E\u22a5 = 0.57 \u00f7 1.672 kV/cm at a constant\ndensity ne = 6.3 \u00d7 108 cm\u22122 [15] and slightly decreases\n(from 2000 to 1500) with an increase in density\nfrom 5 to 12 \u00d7 108 cm\u22122 at a constant pressing field\nE\u22a5 = 1.15 kV/cm [13]. An increase in the effective\nmass is caused by the fact that the strong field presses\nelectrons into the helium surface, thus forming dimples.\nTherefore, the electron motion along the surface involves\na considerable mass of helium associated with the\ndisplacement of the dimples. Though the resultant mass\ndensities of electrons and ripplons are still substantially\n\u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0432 \u0416\u042d\u0422\u0424\n\n\f3\n\nLow-Temperature Mobility of Surface Electrons. . .\n\nwhere we neglected \u03b3 with respect to unity.\nAs expected, the amplitude |u| of the velocity\noscillations has a maximum at zero frequency of the\ndriving field and decreases as 1/\u03c9 at high frequencies\n(\u03c9\u03c4RP \u226b 1) with a \u03c0/2 phase lag compared to\nthe driving field. The appearance of the out-of-phase\ncomponent of the electron velocity (and, consequently,\nthe current) serves as the direct evidence of the\ndiscussed effect. This component has a maximum at\n\u03c9\u03c4RP = 1, which is exactly one half of the maximum\nvalue of the velocity.

In the case of a Wigner solid, the\nbehavior of the mobility changes substantially, first of\nall, because, depending on the magnitude Ek and E\u22a5\n\u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0432 \u0416\u042d\u0422\u0424\n\n108\n\n2\n\nMobility, cm /V.s\n\ndifferent, this mass increase may be sufficient to fulfill\nthe condition \u03c4e \u226a \u03b3\u03c4RP , which is equivalent to\n\u03bc/ene \u226a \u03c4RP /\u03c1R \u2243 53 T \u221220/3 K20/3 s*cm2 /g. For\nexample, at T = 70 mK, ne = 109 cm\u22122 and E\u22a5 =\n1 kV/cm one has \u03c4e \u2243 5 \u00d7 10\u22127 s, \u03b3 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n\u03c4RP \u2243 5\u00d710\u22123 s and, consequently, \u03b3\u03c4RP \u223c 1.5\u00d710\u22125 s.\nIn this case, we find from Eq. (2) with \u03c9\u03c4e \u226a 1\nthat the electron and ripplon velocities almost coincide,\nuR \u2248 ue \u2261 u, and, consequently,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nne \u03c4RP 1 + i\u03c9\u03c4RP\n,\n(4)\nu \u2248 \u2212eEk\n2\n\u03c1R\n1 + \u03c9 2 \u03c4RP\n\n107\n\n106\n\n105\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nT, mK\n\nTemperature dependence of the SE mobility measured\nvia the longitudinal ac conductivity \u03c3xx of the twodimensional system in the Corbino geometry at (\u25e6)\n\u03c9/2\u03c0 = 10 kHz, E\u22a5 = 15 V/cm, ne = 1.4 \u00d7 107 cm\u22122\n[9]; (H) \u03c9/2\u03c0 = 10 kHz, E\u22a5 = 92.5 V/cm, ne =\n1.08 \u00d7 108 cm\u22122 [8], and (\u2022) via the damping of the\nmixed phonon-ripplon modes of a Wigner solid at\n\u03c9/2\u03c0 = 5 \u00f7 10 MHz, ne = 1.3 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 [12]. The\nstraight lines show the dc mobility (5) for the respective\nvalues of ne (from left to right in the order of increasing\ndensity). Some experimental points are omitted for\nbetter visibility.\n\nof the pressing and driving field, excitation frequency\nand temperature, the two-dimensional electron system\nmay find itself in a so-called coupled phonon-ripplon\n(CPR) state formed by the electrons and the respective\ndimples on the helium surface or slide over the helium\nsurface [20, 21]. Under the transition between these\ntwo states, the electron mobility exhibits an abrupt\nchange, which may reach an order of magnitude. In\nthe CPR state of interest, which in fact appears in\nstrong pressing fields and a weak driving field and at\n\u22122\nlow frequencies, the dependence \u03bc \u221d E\u22a5\nis generally\npreserved [15, 22] and the mobility of a Wigner solid also\nweakly depends on temperature [9, 12, 15]. Taking for\nthe estimate the value \u03bc = 6 \u00d7 105 cm2 /V*s obtained at\nne = 1.3 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 and T = 70 mK [12], we find\nthat the rates of momentum transfer from electrons\nto ripplons and from ripplons to photons of helium\nbecome equal at T \u2243 98 mK (see figure). For the\nripplon-phonon interaction to be the bottleneck of the\nlongitudinal momentum relaxation the measurements\nshould be carried out at T . 70 mK. According to Eq.\n(4), the frequency \u03c9 of the driving field in this case\n\n\f4\n\nA. I. Safonov, I. I. Safonova and S. S. Demukh\n\n\u22121\nshould not be greater than \u03c4RP\n\u2243 1.1 \u00d7 108 T 5 K\u22125 s\u22121 ,\nwhich corresponds to \u03c9/2\u03c0 . 30 Hz at the specified\ntemperature.\nThus, we have seen that observing the ripplonphonon interaction in liquid helium via the SE mobility\nrequires the simultaneous fulfillment of the conditions\n\n\u03c4e \u226a\n\nm\u2217 n e\n\u03c4RP\n\u03c1R\n\n(7)\n\nand\n(8)\n\n\u03c9\u03c4RP . 1.\n\nTaking into account the dependence of the effective mass\nm\u2217 and limiting density ne of the surface electrons on\nthe pressing field E\u22a5 and the temperature dependence\nof \u03c1R and \u03c4RP , these conditions may be rewritten in a\nmore practical form\nT\n\n20/3\n\n\u22123\nE\u22a5\n\n\u226a 2 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22127\n\n,\n\n\u03c9/2\u03c0 . 1.5 \u00d7 107 T 5 Hz,\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhere the temperature, field and frequency are\nexpressed in Kelvin, kV/cm and Hz, respectively.\nIn experiments of Dotsenko et al. [12], the condition\n(9) was fulfilled. However, the condition (10) was\nviolated so that the relative contribution of the ripplonphonon interaction in helium to the mobility of the\nelectron crystal was no more than \u223c10\u22125 . The technique\nof mobility measurement via the damping of hybrid\nphonon-ripplon modes of a Wigner solid seems to\nbe fundamentally inapplicable for observing the effect\nunder consideration, since the minimum frequency of\nthe phonon-ripplon modes is given by the lattice\nconstant of the electron crystal and the dispersion\nrelation of ripplons and therefore cannot be smaller\n3/4\nthan \u223c (\u03b1/\u03c1)1/2 ne , where \u03c1 = 0.145 g/cm3 is the\nmass density of 4 He at T = 0 [23]. The mobility of the\ntwo-dimensional electron system can be also determined\nfrom its longitudinal conductivity \u03c3xx measured in the\nCorbino geometry. However, the respective experiments\n[8, 9] violated both conditions, primarily because of the\nsmallness of the pressing field. In particular, at E\u22a5 =\n92.5 V/cm the inequalities (9), (10) yield T \u2264 25 mK\nand \u03c9/2\u03c0 . 0.14 Hz whereas the measurements were\ncarried out at 10 and 100 kHz.\nThus, we have shown that the ripplon-phonon\ninteraction in superfluid helium can be studied with the\nuse of surface electrons and determined the conditions\nto be satisfied by the experimental parameters, i.e.,\ntemperature, excitation frequency, the density of the\ntwo-dimensional electron system, and the magnitude of\nthe pressing electric field.\n\nWe are truly grateful to S.S.Sokolov and\nV.E.Sivokon' for fruitful discussions, to K.Kono\nfor providing us with some of his relevant publications\nand to I.S.Yasnikov for reading the manuscript and\nvaluable remarks.
