These\nkind of external momenta are encoded in special boundary conditions for the\nfermion fields. The method allows to compute certain renormalization factors on the lattice that would have been very difficult, if not impossible, to\ncompute with standard methods. As a result we give the renormalization\ngroup invariant step scaling function for a twist-2 operator corresponding to\nthe average momentum of non-singlet quark densities.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the most important contributions lattice gauge theory can provide to test\nQCD and to interpret experimental data, is the computation of non-perturbatively\nrenormalized matrix elements. The example we are interested in here are matrix\nelements that are connected to moments of parton distribution functions as can be\nextracted from global fits to experimental data in deep inelastic scattering. The\nmatrix elements are related themselves to certain operator expectation values which\nare accessible from lattice simulations.\nWhen considering operators that contain derivatives, a saturation with external\nmomenta is needed to perform the necessary contractions. This applies for computing the renormalization constants as well as matrix elements of such operators. On\nan euclidean lattice, the standard momenta are quantized in units of 2\u03c0a/L with a\nthe lattice spacing and L the linear extent of a lattice of physical size L4 . Unfortunately, the introduction of a momentum in a numerical simulation leads often to\neither large lattice artefacts or to large statistical uncertainties or to both such that\nreliable measurements of such quantities become difficult.\nIn this paper we will demonstrate how the introduction of special boundary conditions of the fermion fields, first advocated in [1], can help in such a situation. The\nboundary conditions lead to continuous values of external momenta a\u03b8/L where \u03b8\nvaries continuously in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0 giving a large flexibility of a momentum definition in lattice simulations. In particular, the minimal value of a lattice\nmomentum can be chosen smaller than in the standard set-up which might lead to\nsmaller lattice artefacts. As we will see in the example discussed below, the use of\nthese kind of continuous external momenta will allow us to compute renormalization\nconstants reliably on the lattice for which measurements were very difficult in the\nstandard set-up. It might be, however, that the method is much more general and\ngoes beyond the application investigated here.\nThe physical example we will discuss in this paper is the calculation of renormalization constants as needed for twist-2, non-singlet quark operators in the framework\nof computing moments of parton distribution functions in deep inelastic scattering.\nThe interest in this calculation is twofold. First, we want to demonstrate the feasibility of using continuous momenta in a lattice computation.\nSecond, the success of this demonstration will allow us to correct a small mismatch of our earlier work: In a series of papers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] we have demonstrated\nthat the Schr\u00f6dinger functional (SF) formalism [7] can be used to compute nonperturbatively moments of parton distribution functions (for summaries of the results, see [8, 9, 10]). A problem that arises naturally in lattice computations of such\nquantities is that for a given continuum operator there is not a unique representation\nof that operator on the lattice. In fact, in the old work cited above, the operator\nused to compute the matrix element and the operator used to compute the corresponding renormalization constant were in two different representations. Although\nin ref. [6] we argued that this mismatch only leads to a small, negligible error, the\n\n1\n\n\fsituation remains rather unsatisfactory, as we want a fully non-perturbative way to\nevaluate the physical matrix element without systematic uncertainties. The usage\nof the continuous external momenta will allow us to eliminate this small systematic\nuncertainty. In particular, we will show that we can compute the scale dependent\nrenormalization constant and the corresponding (ultra-violet) invariant step scaling\nfunction for a particular lattice representation which is needed to perform the correct renormalization for the physical matrix element. In this way, we will be able to\nprovide a non-perturbative lattice computation of the average momentum carried\nby the quarks in a hadron.\n\n2\n\nBasic definitions and choice of boundary conditions\n\nA bare, local operator Obare as considered here, is renormalized multiplicatively by\na scale \u03bc dependent renormalization constant ZO (\u03bc). The renormalized operator\nOR (\u03bc) is then given by\nOR (\u03bc) = ZO\u22121 (\u03bc)Obare .\n(1)\nThe evolution of O from a renormalization scale \u03bc1 to \u03bc2 is described by the continuum step scaling function \u03c3ZO that can formally be written as\n\u03c3ZO (\u03bc1 /\u03bc2 ) =\n\nZO (\u03bc2 )\n.\nZO (\u03bc1 )\n\n(2)\n\nThe individual Z's in eq. (2) are only well-defined within a given regularization\nscheme and would be divergent when the regularization is removed. The step scaling\nfunction, however, is a well-defined quantity even in this limit. In the following we\nwill give a rigorous definition of the renormalization constants and of the step scaling\nfunction using the lattice regularization in the Schr\u00f6dinger functional (SF) scheme.\nThe SF scheme is based on the formulation of QCD in a finite space-time volume\nof size L3 * T . In this paper we will always use L = T . In this scheme a change of\nrenormalization scale amounts to a change of the box size L at fixed bare parameters.\nBy considering a sequence of pairs of volumes with sizes L and sL, one can study the\nevolution of a given local operator under repeated changes of the scale by a factor of\ns. Effectively in this way one builds up a non-perturbative renormalization group.\nTo be specific, we will from now on work on a euclidean lattice as regulator.\nThe fermion and gauge fields on the lattice are defined in the standard way, fulfilling SF boundary conditions, as detailed in ref. [7]. Besides these special boundary\nconditions in time direction, we will impose generalized boundary conditions in the\nspatial directions (denoted by k\u0302) for the fermion fields \u03c8(x) [1]\n\u03c8(x + Lk\u0302) = ei\u03b8k \u03c8(x), \u03c8\u0304(x + Lk\u0302) = e\u2212i\u03b8k \u03c8\u0304(x), k = 1, 2, 3,\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhile the gauge fields U(x, k) are chosen to be periodic in the space directions. The\nvalues of \u03b8k can be chosen in the interval 0 \u2264 \u03b8k \u2264 2\u03c0. For \u03b8k = 0 we obtain periodic\nand for \u03b8k = \u03c0 we get anti-periodic boundary conditions.\nThe generalized boundary conditions of eq. (3) can be implemented in the definition of the gauge covariant lattice derivatives:\n1\n[\u03bb\u03bc U(x, \u03bc)\u03c8(x + a\u03bc\u0302) \u2212 \u03c8(x)]\na\n\u0003\n1\u0002\n\u2207\u2217\u03bc \u03c8(x) =\n\u03c8(x) \u2212 \u03bb\u2217\u03bc U(x \u2212 a\u03bc\u0302, \u03bc)\u03c8(x \u2212 a\u03bc\u0302)\na\n\n\u2207\u03bc \u03c8(x) =\n\nwith \u03bc = (k, 4),\n\n\u03bb\u03bc = eia\u03b8\u03bc /L , 0 \u2264 \u03b8k \u2264 2\u03c0, \u03b84 = 0,\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nand a the lattice spacing. From a technical point of view the fields \u03c8(x) and \u03c8\u0304(x)\nare then implemented with the usual periodic boundary conditions in the space\ndirections utilizing this generalized definition of the covariant derivative of eq. (4).\nThe crucial observation [1] is that the factor eia\u03b8k /L can be interpreted as an\nexternal momentum with the intriguing property that it can assume continuous\nvalues, in contrast to the standard, quantized lattice momenta that assumes values\nin units of 2\u03c0a/L only.\nIn order to explore the flexibility of a momentum definition given by the generalized boundary conditions in eq. (3) we have concentrated in this work on the\ntwist-2, non-singlet (quark) operator. This amounts to consider operators of the\nform (the flavor structure is specified by the Pauli matrix \u03c4 3 )\n\u2194\n1\n1\nO\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3{\u03bc D \u03bd} \u03c4 3 \u03c8(x) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd * trace terms .\n4\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere {* * * } means symmetrization on the Lorentz indices and\n\u2194\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2190\n\nD \u03bc =D \u03bc \u2212 D \u03bc ;\n\n1\nD\u03bc = [\u2207\u03bc + \u2207\u2217\u03bc ] .\n2\n\n(7)\n\nThere are two representations of such a non-singlet operator on the lattice [11].\nThe first representation takes \u03bc 6= \u03bd whereas the second uses \u03bc = \u03bd. The precise\ndefinitions of the operators used here are\n\u2194\n1\n1\nO12 (x) = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3{1 D 2} \u03c4 3 \u03c8(x)\n4\n2\n\nand\n\n3\nh \u2194\n1\n1 X \u2194 i\u03c43\nO44 (x) = \u03c8\u0304(x) \u03b34 D4 \u2212\n\u03b3k D k\n\u03c8(x) .\n2\n3 k=1\n2\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nIn both cases an external momentum has to be supplied to compute their renormalization constants. We will realize these momenta with non-vanishing values of\n\n3\n\n\f\u03b8k , implicitly given through the covariant derivatives in the fermion action and the\noperators in eqs. (8), (9). The precise choice we adopt here is\n\u03b8 \u2261 \u03b81 6= 0, \u03b82 = \u03b83 = 0 .\n\n(10)\n\nIn order to make the discussion in the following self-consistent, let us recall the\ndefinition of bare correlation functions in the SF scheme [3] as needed to compute\nappropriate renormalization factors. The correlation function of a given operator O\nis given by\na6 X\n1\nfO (x4 /L, \u03b8) = \u2212 3\nhO\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u03b6\u0304(y)\u0393 \u03c4 3 \u03b6(z)i ,\n(11)\nL x,y,z\n2\n\nwhere \u0393 is a Dirac matrix that in our case is \u03b32 for the O12 operator, while it is \u03b31\nfor O44 . In eq. (11) \u03b6 and \u03b6\u0304 are classical boundary fields at x4 = 0 and we sum over\nspace. In order to normalize such correlation functions properly, we also need the\n\"boundary to boundary\" correlation function f1 ,\nf1 (\u03b8) = \u2212\n\n1 a \u2032\n1 a\na12 X \u2032\nh\n\u03b6\u0304\n(u)\u03b3\n\u03c4\n\u03b6\n(v)\n\u03b6\u0304(y)\u03b3\n\u03c4 \u03b6(z)i .\n5\n5\nL6 u,v,y,z\n2\n2\n\n(12)\n\nNote that the classical boundary source fields \u03b6, \u03b6\u0304 at x4 = 0 and \u03b6 \u2032 , \u03b6\u0304 \u2032 at x4 = L are\nrenormalized multiplicatively with a common renormalization constant Z\u03b6 [12, 13].\nThe momentum (\u03b8) dependence of the correlation functions fO in eq. (11) and f1 in\neq. (12) is again implicitly given through the definition of the covariant derivative\neq. (4) that appears in the fermion action and in the operator considered.\nIt is instructive to look at the \u03b8-dependence of the correlation functions fO44 and\nfO12 for fixed values of x4 /L = 1/2 and x4 /L = 1/4 already at tree-level. Fig. 1\n(0)\nshows the tree-level correlation functions fO . It can be observed that the signal\nstrongly depends on the chosen value of \u03b8, the definition of the operator and the\nchoice of x4 /L. For small values of \u03b8 all correlation functions show a linear behavior\nin \u03b8 and vanish at \u03b8 = 0. In contrast to the correlation function of the operator\nO12 , the correlator for O44 , which does not depend on x4 /L at tree-level, becomes\nvery small for values of, say, \u03b8 > 4.5, see the inlay in fig. 1. This implies that for\na real simulation there is a danger that for these \u03b8-values the signal may become\nvery small, too. In addition, it seems that for these values of \u03b8, due to large lattice\nartifacts (cf. sect. 2.2) it may become hard to extract even the one-loop anomalous\ndimension. It should be concluded therefore that the choice of \u03b8 in a simulation needs\nan optimization procedure. Before we can start a discussion of how to perform this\noptimization we first want to give here the renormalization conditions we have used\nin order to determine the renormalization factors which are defined as follows.\np\nZO (a/L, x4 /L, \u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ) = c fO (a/L, x4 /L, \u03b8)/ f1 (a/L, \u03b8\u2032 )\n(13)\nZ\u0304O (a/L, x4 /L, \u03b8) = c\u0304 fO (a/L, x4 /L, \u03b8)\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: \u03b8-dependence of fO at tree-level. For the O44 representation the tree-level\nvalues at x4 = L/2 and x4 = L/4 are the same.\nwhere the correlation functions are being evaluated at vanishing quark mass mq = 0\nand for vanishing boundary gauge and fermion fields. The renormalization conditions are chosen such that ZO = 1 and Z\u0304O = 1 at tree-level of perturbation theory\nat a fixed scale \u03bc = 1/L [2, 3] while the external parameters \u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 and x4 /L can be\nvaried. From these conditions we obtain\nq\n(0)\nf1\n1\n(14)\nc = (0) , c\u0304 = (0) .\nfO\nfO\nThe quantities c and c\u0304 are the expressions of the correlation functions in eq. (11)\nand in eq. (12) at tree-level with the corresponding arguments. Note that the actual\nrenormalization constant needed is ZO whereas Z\u0304O is only an auxiliary quantity\nthat, however, proved useful in our previous work [3]. Note that in the definition\nof the renormalization constants in eq. (13) we leave the freedom to choose \u03b8 6= \u03b8\u2032\nfor fO and f1 . It is important to stress here that a different choice of x4 /L, \u03b8 and\n\u03b8\u2032 defines a different renormalization scheme. In this paper we have considered two\nfamilies of renormalization schemes,\n\u2022 scheme A\n\n\u03b8\u2032 = \u03b8\n\n\u2022 scheme B\n\n\u03b8\u2032 = 0 .\n\n5\n\n\fBoth schemes are studied in the following with respect to analyzing the convergence\nof perturbation theory, the size of cutoff effects and the signal to noise ratio. In these\nstudies the external parameters \u03b8 and x4 /L are tuned to optimize these criteria.\n\n2.1\n\nConvergence of perturbation theory\n\nIn this section we present a perturbative analysis of renormalization constants for\nthe local operators in eq. (8) and in eq. (9). In particular we compute the 2-loop\nanomalous dimension for the Z-factors for the two schemes discussed above. In bare\nperturbation theory the renormalization constants have an expansion of the form\nZO (g0 , a/L, x4 /L, \u03b8) = 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(k)\n\nZO (a/L, x4 /L, \u03b8) g02k ,\n\n(15)\n\nk=1\n\n(k)\n\nwhere in the limit a/L \u2192 0 the coefficients ZO are polynomials in ln(L/a) of\ndegree k up to corrections of O(a/L). In particular the coefficient of the logarithmic\n(1)\n(1)\ndivergence in ZO is given by the one-loop anomalous dimension \u03b30 , and thus ZO\nis parameterized as\n(1)\n\nZO = BO (\u03b8, x4 /L) \u2212 \u03b30 ln(L/a) + O(a/L) .\n\n(16)\n\nThe values for the 1-loop anomalous dimension \u03b30 and the constant piece BO (\u03b8, x4 /L)\ncan be computed in lattice perturbation theory for the SF scheme following the techniques developed in [2, 14]. For the matching of the non-perturbative lattice results\nand perturbation theory at very high energies, it is important to know also the 2loop anomalous dimension \u03b31 \u2217 . Since \u03b31 is not universal, it becomes necessary to\ncompute the dependence of \u03b31 on the values of \u03b8 and x4 /L. In this way it becomes\npossible to control for which choice of these parameters \u03b31 /\u03b30 is small in order to\nhave a good behavior of the perturbative series.\n(2)\nThe coefficient ZO \u221d \u03b31 ln(L/a) can actually be obtained without an explicit\n2-loop calculation in the SF scheme if the 2-loop anomalous dimension is already\nknown from a different renormalization scheme [15]. The formula relating the 2-loop\nanomalous dimensions in the SF and the MS schemes is given by\n(1)\n\n\u03b31 = \u03b31MS + 2b0 \u2206ZO \u2212 \u03b30 Xg(1) .\n\n(17)\n(1)\n\nIn eq. (17) b0 is the universal 1-loop coefficient of the \u03b2-function, \u2206ZO is the 1-loop\ndifference of the renormalization constants from a finite renormalization that relates\n(1)\ntwo mass-independent schemes and Xg is the perturbative factor that relates the\nrenormalized couplings in the two schemes considered (see the appendix for explicit\nexpressions of these quantities).\n(1)\nA subtlety is that the factor \u2206ZO needs to be computed in two different regularizations, in order to avoid a calculation with the SF scheme using a dimensional\nregularization (DR).\n\u2217\n\nWhen we omit an explicit scheme index, we always mean the SF renormalization scheme.\n\n6\n\n\fLattice reg.\n\nRenormalization\nschemes\n\nDimensional reg.\n\nSF\nMS\nMOM\nFigure 2: Graphical representation of the finite renormalization between schemes\nwhen a different regularization is used.\ns\nLet us explain this fact. A matrix element OR\nrenormalized in a certain scheme\ns is obtained by\ns\nOR\n= ZOs,reg Obreg\n(18)\n\nwhere Obreg is the bare matrix element computed within a certain regularization\nreg and ZOs,reg is the renormalization constant that depends on the renormalization\nscheme s used and on the regularization reg.

This allows to relate two schemes: in principle it is possible to compute the complete 1-loop renormalization constant (anomalous dimension\nand finite part) in the SF scheme, using the dimensional regularization and then\nconnect directly with the MS scheme (dashed line in fig. 2),\n\u2206ZOSF \u2190MS = ZOSF,DR/ZOMS,DR .\n\n(20)\n\nA lattice perturbative computation will give, on the other side, important information about the amount of discretization errors at 1-loop and would help the numerical\n\n7\n\n\f\u03b8\n0.1\n0.4\n0.7\n1.0\n1.3\n1.6\n1.9\n2.2\n2.5\n2.8\n3.1\n\n\u03b31A (\u03b8)\n0.06584(1)\n0.06083(1)\n0.05196(1)\n0.04211(1)\n0.03313(1)\n0.02561(1)\n0.01951(1)\n0.01449(1)\n0.01019(1)\n0.00627(3)\n0.00231(3)\n\n\u03b31B (\u03b8)\n\n\u03b31A (\u03b8)/\u03b30\n\n0.06551(1)\n0.05669(1)\n0.04135(1)\n0.02482(1)\n0.01029(1)\n\u22120.00139(1)\n\u22120.01051(1)\n\u22120.01775(1)\n\u22120.02375(1)\n\u22120.02903(3)\n\u22120.03412(3)\n\n1.4621(6)\n1.3509(6)\n1.1539(6)\n0.9352(6)\n0.7357(6)\n0.5687(6)\n0.4332(6)\n0.3217(6)\n0.2263(6)\n0.1392(6)\n0.0512(6)\n\n\u03b31B (\u03b8)/\u03b30\n1.4548(3)\n1.2590(2)\n0.9182(2)\n0.5512(2)\n0.2286(2)\n\u22120.0308(3)\n\u22120.2334(3)\n\u22120.3943(3)\n\u22120.5273(3)\n\u22120.6446(6)\n\u22120.7578(6)\n\nTable 1: 2-loop anomalous dimension for the O44 representation computed in 2 different renormalization schemes (cf. text) for several values of \u03b8 and x4 /L = 1/2.

In order to avoid an additional computation in the SF scheme one may\nnow use the MOM scheme, where a complete 1-loop computation has been done for\nthe renormalization constant in both regularization schemes [16].\nThe desired factor \u2206ZOSF \u2190MS relating the SF to the MS scheme (full line in fig. 2)\ncan now be obtained from\n\u2206ZOSF \u2190MS = \u2206ZOSF \u2190M OM \u2206ZOM OM \u2190MS .\n\n(21)\n\nThe two factors \u2206Z are computed using different regularizations, namely \u2206ZOSF \u2190M OM\nis computed on the lattice and \u2206ZOM OM \u2190MS in dimensional regularization. Using\nthe complete one loop result [16] in the MOM scheme which exists in both, lattice\n(1)\nand dimensional, regularizations, it is then possible to compute \u2206ZO and from this\nfinally \u03b31 .\nIn table 1 we give values for \u03b31 for selected values of \u03b8 and x4 /L = 1/2. From\nthis table we observe that the ratio \u03b31 /\u03b30 becomes smaller for increasing values of\n\u03b8 if we choose the scheme A (\u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 ). For scheme B (\u03b8\u2032 = 0), we find a kind of\nminimum of this ratio for \u03b8 \u2248 1.6. We repeated the analysis for the anomalous\ndimensions for x4 /L = 1/4 and found a very similar pattern. Thus we have a first\nindication for the choice of \u03b8 to be chosen.\n\n2.2\n\nOne-loop cut-off effects\n\nAs discussed above, an essential element to obtain the non-perturbative scale dependence of a matrix element is the step scaling function of eq. (2) which describes\n\n8\n\n\fa change from a scale L\u22121 to (sL)\u22121 , with a scale factor s. Employing a lattice\nregularization, we define the lattice step scaling function [1]\n\u03a3ZO (s, \u1e21 2, a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) =\n\nZO (g0 , sL/a; x4 /L, \u03b8)\nZO (g0 , L/a; x4 /L, \u03b8)\n\n(22)\n\u1e21(L)=fixed\n\nwhere \u1e21(L) is the renormalized coupling at scale L\u22121 . The desired continuum step\nscaling is obtained from a limit procedure\nlim \u03a3ZO (s, \u1e21 2 , a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) = \u03c3ZO (s, \u1e21 2; x4 /L, \u03b8) .\n\na\u21920\n\n(23)\n\nIn the following, the above step scaling functions and the renormalized coupling are\ncomputed in the SF scheme and the scale factor is set to s = 2. To one-loop order\nof perturbation theory we find\n\u03a3ZO (2, \u1e21 2, a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) = 1 + k(a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8)\u1e21 2 + O(\u1e21 4)\nwith\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nk(a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) = ZO (a/2L; x4 /L, \u03b8) \u2212 ZO (a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) .\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nIn order to see how fast the continuum limit in eq. (23) is approached, we define the\nnormalized deviation from this value:\n\u03b4k (a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) =\n\nk(a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) \u2212 k(0)\n.\nk(0)\n\n(26)\n\nHere k(0; x4 /L, \u03b8) = \u2212\u03b30 ln(2) is the continuum limit value which is independent\nfrom x4 /L and \u03b8. The quantity \u03b4k in eq. (26) contains all the lattice artifacts at\nO(\u1e21 2). The results for O44 with x4 /L = 1/2 are displayed in fig. 3. Note that\nwe have worked in the unimproved theory where we expect the lattice artifacts to\ndecrease asymptotically with a rate proportional to a/L. We show our results for\n\u03b4k (a/L; x4 /L, \u03b8) for various values of \u03b8. The full symbols denote results obtained in\nthe renormalization scheme A, while the open symbols correspond to results in the\nscheme B.\nWe see from fig. 3 that there is no real preference for choosing scheme A or\nscheme B as far as the lattice artefacts are concerned. On the other hand, for\nlarge values of \u03b8, the lattice artefacts become very strong which would lead to\na difficult continuum extrapolation in the numerical simulations. It seems from\nthis perturbative analysis that values around \u03b8 = 1 should be a good choice for a\nfast convergence of perturbation theory and for keeping lattice artefacts well under\ncontrol.\n\n2.3\n\nSignal to noise ratio\n\nThe analysis of the tree-level correlation function of the operator O44 demonstrates\nthat for \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, corresponding to the smallest value of standard quantized momenta\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 3: Discretization errors in the unimproved step scaling function at 1-loop\norder of perturbation theory.

The chosen value of \u03ba corresponds to mq = 0.\nThe lines only connect the points to guide the eye.\non the lattice, the value of the correlation function becomes tiny. If this also applies\nin the interacting case, it may become very difficult to obtain a reliable measurement from a numerical simulation. On the other hand, fig. 1 shows that employing\nthe boundary conditions of eq. (3) and choosing \u03b8 < 2\u03c0 the situation improves\nconsiderably.\nOf course, the tree-level analysis can not give any information on the \u03b8-dependence\nof the relative statistical error \u2206Z/Z of a renormalization constant, which is the most\nimportant benchmark for a practical numerical simulation. In order to compute\n\u2206Z/Z for ZO44 and ZO12 , we performed therefore a simulation for non-perturbatively\nO(a)-improved (clover) fermions [17] at \u03b2 = 7.0203, \u03ba = 0.134707 (corresponding to\n\u03bac ) on a 164 lattice. We show in fig. 4 the result of this investigation.\nLet us start the discussion on the relative error for ZO12 . For \u03b8 > 1, the relative\nerror appears to be almost constant up to \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 and independent of choosing\nx4 /L = 1/2 or x4 /L = 1/4. This means that for the operator O12 choosing a\nphysical momentum (as done in our earlier work) or introducing \u03b8 would have led\nto the same quality of the final results.\nFor the operator O44 the situation is different, however. At \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 the relative\nerror of ZO44 evaluated at x4 /L = 1/2 is a factor 5-6 larger than the corresponding\nrelative error of ZO12 . For x4 /L = 1/4 the situation is better, but the error is\nagain about a factor 2 worse than for ZO12 at least for \u03b8 = 2\u03c0. We observe a\nrather shallow minimum in \u03b8 starting around \u03b8 = 1 and ranging up to \u03b8 = 2 where\nthe relative errors of the renormalization constants for both operators O12 and O44\nare about the same and comparable to \u2206Z/Z of ZO12 (\u03b8 = 2\u03c0). The case of ZO44\nis hence an example where using \u03b8 instead of standard lattice momenta can help\n\n11\n\n\fsubstantially. From Fig. 4 the value of \u03b8 to be chosen for a practical simulation can\nnot be clearly identified. However, taken our analysis of the convergence behavior\nof perturbation theory, the cutoff effects as computed in 1-loop perturbation theory\nand the investigation of the signal to noise ratio together, we conclude that \u03b8 = 1\nshould be a reasonable choice.\n\n3\n\nNon-perturbative step scaling functions\n\nChoosing the lattice regularization discussed above, is, of course, motivated by the\nadvantage to perform numerical simulations. The aim of such simulations is to compute the lattice step scaling functions of eq. (22) non-perturbatively at non-vanishing\nvalues of the lattice spacing and to perform the \u2013well-defined\u2013 continuum limit of\neq. (23). Besides the lattice step scaling function \u03a3ZO , we will also consider \u03a3Z\u0304O ,\nconstructed in a completely analogous way from the definition of the renormalization factors in eq. (13). In addition, we will compute the step scaling function of f1 ,\neq. (12),\np\n1 f1 (sL, \u03b8)\n\u03c3f1 (\u03b8) = p\n(27)\n\u0109 f1 (L, \u03b8)\nq\nq\n(0)\n(0)\nwhere \u0109 = f1 (sL, \u03b8)/ f1 (L, \u03b8) is the corresponding ratio at tree-level. The\nlattice version \u03a3f1 (a/L; \u03b8) of this step scaling function is again defined in the obvious\nway. To complete the definition of the step scaling functions, certain choices of the\nvalues for \u03b8, s, x4 /L and the quark mass mq have to be made. We fix these in the\nfollowing to\nx4 /L = 1/2, s = 2, \u03b8 = 1, mq = 0 .\n(28)\nIn order to justify our choice of x4 /L = 1/2 we show a comparison of the step\nscaling function \u03a3Z44 both at x4 /L = 1/4 and x4 /L = 1/2 in fig. 5. Strong lattice\nartifacts are visible for x4 /L = 1/4. Approaching the continuum limit this effect is\nconsiderably reduced, but it is clear that \u03a3Z44 is much better behaved as a function\nof a/L when x4 /L = 1/2 is chosen, which allows for a reliable (linear) continuum\nextrapolation. With the parameter choices in eq. (28), we will in the following\nonly give the arguments of ZO and \u03c3ZO when they differ from these values. In\nparticular, with the choice of s = 2 the step scaling function becomes a function\nof only one scale, i.e. \u03c3ZO (\u03bc1 /\u03bc2 ) \u2192 \u03c3ZO (\u03bc) and correspondingly the lattice step\nscaling function will only depend on the scale \u03bc (given by a fixed value of \u1e21(L)) and\na/L.\nAs already discussed above, the continuum limit of \u03a3ZO (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L) is to be\ntaken at a fixed value of the renormalization scale \u03bc = 1/L in order to obtain the\ndesired continuum step scaling function \u03c3ZO (\u1e21 2 (L)). Fixing the scale is realized by\nfixing the renormalized coupling \u1e21 2 (L), which in turn can be achieved by changing\nthe value of the bare coupling as the value of the lattice spacing (and correspondingly\na/L) is decreased. Using the SF scheme, the matching points of the bare coupling g0\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 5: Lattice step scaling functions \u03a3Z44 (a/L) at x4 = L/4 and x4 = L/2 at\n\u1e21 2 = 1.8811. The value of \u03b8 is taken from our choices in eq. (28).\nto keep \u1e21 2 (L) fixed when the lattice spacing is sent to zero can be found in [18]. Of\ncourse, the values of \u03a3ZO (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L) themselves have to be computed in a numerical\nsimulation on lattices with increasing number of points N 4 = (L/a)4 as a \u2192 0.\nAs in our previous work, we will choose two different lattice discretizations,\nstandard Wilson fermions and non-perturbatively O(a)-improved (clover) fermions\nto compute the step scaling function \u03a3ZO (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L). Since we want to employ a\nmassless renormalization scheme and have to stay therefore at zero quark, we take\nfrom [18] the values of \u03bac for clover fermions to stay in the massless limit. For the\ncase of Wilson fermions, we determined \u03bac ourselves (see table 2).\nSimulations have been performed on APEmille machines using even\u2013sized lattices\nranging from 64 to 324 . We recall that for both actions we used the unimproved\noperator: as a consequence, the results at finite values of the lattice spacing are\naffected by lattice artefacts of O(a), whose precise form depends upon the choice of\nthe lattice action.\nFor the inversion of the Dirac operator we used the implementation [19] of the\nSSOR-preconditioned BiCGStab inverter [20]. The gauge fields were generated with\na hybrid of Cabibbo\u2013Marinari heat\u2013bath and over\u2013relaxation updates: we decided\nto keep the number of over\u2013relaxation steps between a single heat-bath one proportional to L/a (in practice Nor = 21 L/a). A full update sweep is defined as one\nheat\u2013bath step followed by Nor steps: in order to statistically decorrelate the gauge\n\n13\n\n\fg 2SF\nL/a\n0.8873\n6\n8\n12\n16\n1.0989\n6\n8\n12\n16\n1.3293\n6\n8\n12\n16\n1.5533\n6\n8\n12\n16\n1.8811\n6\n8\n12\n16\n2.1000\n6\n8\n12\n16\n2.4484\n6\n8\n12\n16\n2.7700\n6\n8\n12\n16\n3.4800\n6\n8\n12\n16\n\n\u03b2\n10.7503\n11.0000\n11.3384\n11.5736\n9.5030\n9.7500\n10.0577\n10.3419\n8.6129\n8.8500\n9.1859\n9.4381\n7.9993\n8.2500\n8.5985\n8.8323\n7.4082\n7.6547\n7.9993\n8.2415\n7.1214\n7.3632\n7.6985\n7.9560\n6.7807\n7.0197\n7.3551\n7.6101\n6.5512\n6.7860\n7.1190\n7.3686\n6.2204\n6.4527\n6.7750\n7.0203\n\n\u03bac [W ilson]\n0.134696(7)\n0.134548(6)\n0.134277(5)\n0.134068(6)\n0.136520(5)\n0.136310(3)\n0.135949(4)\n0.135572(4)\n0.138346(6)\n0.138057(4)\n0.137503(2)\n0.137061(4)\n0.140003(11)\n0.139588(8)\n0.138847(6)\n0.138339(7)\n0.142145(11)\n0.141572(9)\n0.140597(6)\n0.139900(6)\n0.143416(11)\n0.142749(9)\n0.141657(6)\n0.140817(7)\n0.145286(11)\n0.144454(7)\n0.143113(6)\n0.142107(6)\n0.146825(11)\n0.145859(7)\n0.144299(8)\n0.143113(?)\n0.149685(15)\n0.148391(9)\n0.146408(7)\n0.145025(8)\n\n\u03bac [Clover]\n0.130591(4)\n0.130439(3)\n0.130251(2)\n0.130125(2)\n0.131514(5)\n0.131312(3)\n0.131079(3)\n0.130876(2)\n0.132380(6)\n0.132140(5)\n0.131814(3)\n0.131589(2)\n0.133118(7)\n0.132821(5)\n0.132427(3)\n0.132169(3)\n0.133961(8)\n0.133632(6)\n0.133159(4)\n0.132847(3)\n0.134423(9)\n0.134088(6)\n0.133599(4)\n0.133229(3)\n0.134994(11)\n0.134639(7)\n0.134141(5)\n0.133729(4)\n0.135327(12)\n0.135056(8)\n0.134513(5)\n0.134114(3)\n0.135470(15)\n0.135543(9)\n0.135121(5)\n0.134707(4)\n\nTable 2: Simulation Parameters\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 6: Lattice step scaling functions \u03a3f1 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L) and \u03a3Z\u030444 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L) at\n\u1e21 2 = 1.8811. The values of \u03b8 and x4 /L are taken from our choices in eq. (28).\nconfigurations used to take measurements of our observables, we allowed for a number of full sweeps between measurements ranging from 20 (lattices up to L/a = 16)\nto 70 (L/a = 32).\nAs usual in this kind of finite\u2013size\u2013step simulations, the signal over noise ratio\ndeteriorates for larger values of \u1e21 2 , in the fully non\u2013perturbative regime. In order\nto maintain constant, up to a certain degree, the relative statistical errors on our\nobservables, we are obliged to increase the statistics. For example, in the clover case\nand on L/a = 32 lattices, the number of measurements has to grow from around 300\nat the smallest values of \u1e21 2 up to order 700 at the largest value of the renormalized\ncoupling. Accordingly, for lattices with a smaller number of space\u2013time points, the\nnumber of measurements grows from 500 to 2000. The pattern for the Wilson case\nis similar, albeit with an overall smaller statistical sample.\nIn Fig. 6 we show separately the lattice step scaling functions \u03a3Z\u030444 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L)\nand \u03a3f1 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L) at four values of a/L for \u1e21 2 fixed. Both step scaling functions\nshow rather large lattice artefacts. For \u03a3f1 this behavior is in sharp contrast to the\ncase of choosing \u03b8 = 0, where the a/L dependence of \u03a3f1 is basically flat, at least\nin the O(a)-improved theory [3, 4]. This flat behavior led us, in our earlier work,\nto the conclusion to perform the continuum limit of \u03a3Z\u030412 and \u03a3f1 separately and\nto compute the desired continuum step scaling function \u03c3Z12 = \u03c3Z\u030412 /\u03c3f1 after the\ncontinuum limit of \u03a3Z\u030412 and \u03a3f1 had been performed.\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 7: Examples of the continuum limit of step scaling functions for both Wilson\nand clover fermions. The (constrained) fit performed is linear, taking the 3 data\npoints with smallest values of a/L. We also indicate the values of the running\ncoupling that correspond to these step scaling functions.\nThe example of the step scaling functions, shown in Fig. 6, indicates that for \u03b8\nnon-vanishing the strategy might be different. Indeed, we found in the analysis of\nour data \u2013for \u03b8 = 1\u2013 that in the ratios\n\u03a3Z\u030444 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L)/\u03a3f1 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L)\n\n(29)\n\n\u03a3Z\u030412 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L)/\u03a3f1 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L)\n\n(30)\n\nand\nthe lattice artefacts essentially cancel. This cancellation happens for clover as well\nas for Wilson fermions. We decided therefore that for our choice of \u03b8 = 1 to first\ncompute\n(31)\n\u03a3Z (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L) = \u03a3Z\u0304 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L)/\u03a3f1 (\u1e21 2 (L), a/L)\nat a given value of a/L and then perform the continuum limit.\nIn Fig. 7 we show examples of the continuum extrapolations of \u03a3O44 for both\ndiscretization, Wilson and clover fermions. It can be observed that in both cases\nthe continuum extrapolation is linear in the lattice spacing when the data points\nwith the three smallest values of a/L are taken. In the plot we show already a\nconstraint fit, demanding that both set of lattice results extrapolate to the same\nvalue of the continuum step scaling function. We obtain a very similar plot for\n\u03a3O12 . The numerical results of the continuum extrapolation as well as for the four\nlattice spacings are summarized in table 3 for the O12 and in table 4 for the O44\noperator.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 8: Continuum step scaling function \u03c3Z44 . The solid line represents the\nparameterization eq. (32), the dotted line represents the the 1-loop, the dashed line\nthe 2-loop predictions from perturbation theory.\nOne subtlety, we want to mention, is that even in the continuum limit at fixed\nscale, the step scaling functions of O44 and O12 do not assume the same value. The\nreason is that both operators belong to two different representations and in the here\nadopted finite volume renormalization scheme they are therefore also part of the\nprecise definition of the scheme. It is hence not possible, to constrain the fits even\nmore by demanding that \u03a3O44 and \u03a3O12 converge to the same value of the continuum\nstep scaling function.\n\n4\n\nRunning and invariant step scaling function\n\nAt this stage, we can leave the lattice and discuss continuum quantities only. The\nonly reminder that we have performed a lattice calculation is that we will stay in\nthe somewhat unusual, finite volume SF renormalization scheme. The simulations\ndescribed in the previous section provide us with the continuum step scaling functions \u03c3Z44 and \u03c3Z12 at a number of values for the running coupling 0.8 < \u1e21 2 < 3.5,\ncorresponding to a wide range of scales, 500 MeV < \u03bc < 100 GeV.\nIn Fig. 8 we show the continuum step scaling function \u03c3Z44 as a function of the\nrunning coupling (and hence the scale). The dotted curve is the 1-loop perturbative\nanalysis for the step scaling function, whereas the dashed curve is a 2-loop result,\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 9: Continuum step scaling function \u03c3Z12 . The solid line represents the\nparameterization eq. (32), the dotted line represents the the 1-loop, the dashed line\nthe 2-loop predictions from perturbation theory. We also show the values of \u03c3Z12 for\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0 (open symbols) corresponding to a minimal physical momentum.\ntaking the 2-loop anomalous dimension in the SF scheme from its relation to the\n2-loop anomalous dimension in the MS-scheme discussed in section 2.1. The solid\nline is a fit to the data according to the formula\n\u03c3Z44 = 1 \u2212 \u03b30 ln(2)g02 + c1 g04 + c2 g06 .\n\n(32)\n\nIn eq. (32) we have taken the known 1-loop (\u03b30 ) and fitted only the coefficients c1 , c2\nwhich we find to be c1 = \u22120.0334(50), c2 = 0.0041(18). It can be seen from the\nfigure that 1-loop perturbation theory is not a good description of the data at all.\nEven 2-loop perturbation theory represents the data only up to \u1e21 2 = 2, or so.\nFig. 9 is the same as fig. 8 for the operator O12 . In this case we find the coefficients\nc1 = \u22120.0343(41), c2 = 0.0049(14) for the parameterization of eq. (32). In addition,\nwe show the values of the step scaling function \u03c3Zp 12 as obtained in our earlier work,\ni.e. using \u03b8 = 0 and a momentum p = 2\u03c0/L (open symbols). Clearly, the scale\ndependence of \u03c3Z12 (\u03b8 = 1) is much stronger than for \u03c3Zp 12 .\nThe final result of this paper is the (ultra-violet) invariant step scaling function\nfor the operators O44 and O12 as they are needed to describe the running of the\nphysical matrix element in other schemes than the SF one. We adopt here the\n\n18\n\n\fdefinition of the invariant step scaling function as given in [5]:\n( Z\n\u0015)\n\u0014\n\u1e21(\u03bc)\n\u03b30\n\u03b3(g)\nUV,SF\n2\n2\n\u2212\u03b30 /2b0\n.\nSINV (\u03bc0 ) = \u03c3(\u03bc/\u03bc0, \u1e21 (L0 )) * (\u1e21 (L))\nexp \u2212\ndg\n\u2212\n\u03b2(g) b0 g\n0\n(33)\nThe \u03b2- and \u03b3-functions in eq. (33) will be taken to a given order in perturbation\ntheory in the SF scheme. A scheme dependence is still manifest in SINV through\nthe appearance of the infra-red scale (\u03bc0 = L\u22121\n0 ). We thus add a superscript to\nindicate that the invariant step scaling function is computed within the Schr\u00f6dinger\nfunctional scheme.\nFor large enough scales in the ultra-violet, it is expected that the running of\nthe step scaling functions, as computed non-perturbatively above, will match the\nperturbative running and hence that SINV will become independent from the scale.\nIn order to test at which scales SINV becomes constant, we have to evolve the step\nscaling functions starting from our most non-perturbative scale \u03bc0 = (1/2Lmax ),\nimplicitly given by \u1e21 2(2Lmax ) = 3.48. One finds [21] 2Lmax = (1.476r0 ), where\nr0 \u2248 0.5fm. The step scaling functions \u03c3ZO are only computed at certain values of\n\u1e21 2 (L). Subsequent values of \u1e21 2 (L) do, however, not correspond to a scale change by\na factor of two as needed. In order to find the precise evolution by steps of two an\ninterpolation in \u1e21 2 (L) has to be performed using the parameterization of eq. (32).\nThe corresponding values of the step scaling function can be found in table 5.\nThe error of the so obtained values of \u03c3ZO is evaluated by a standard error\npropagation taking the correlation of the fit parameters into account through the\ncovariance matrix (cov), i.e.\ns\n\u2202\u03c3ZO 2\n\u2202\u03c3ZO \u2202\u03c3ZO\n\u2202\u03c3ZO 2\n\u2202\u03c3ZO\n(\u2206\u03c3ZO ) =\n(\u2206c1 )2 +\n(\u2206c2 )2 + 2\n*\n* cov12 +\n\u2206\u1e21 2 .\n\u2202c1\n\u2202c2\n\u2202c1\n\u2202c2\n\u2202\u1e21 2\n(34)\nAs an aside we mention that we also have seen that the errors coming from the\nuncertainty in \u1e21 2 (L) are not negligible, and they are included in the values given in\ntable 5. In evaluating SINV in eq. (33) we have taken the 3-loop \u03b2-function and the\n2-loop \u03b3-function.\n(0)\n(0)\nIn Fig. 10 we show SINV as a function of \u03bc/\u039bSF with \u039bSF \u2248 120 MeV being the\n\u039b-parameter in the quenched approximation in the SF scheme. For the operator O44\n(0)\n(full symbols) the invariant step scaling function is constant for, say, \u03bc/\u039bSF > 50\nindicating that contact with perturbation theory can safely be made. In the same\nfigure we also show the value of the invariant step scaling function for O12 which\nshows a very similar behavior. The fact that both invariant step scaling functions\nassume different values indicates again that the two different operators define two\ndifferent renormalization schemes, at least in a finite volume scheme like the SF.\nThe difference will only disappear in the physical renormalization group invariant\nmatrix element.\n\n19\n\n\fFigure 10: The RG invariant step scaling function for the operator O44 (full symbols)\nand the operator O12 (open symbols).\nIn order to obtain finally the values of the invariant step scaling functions, we\nhave taken the values at the corresponding largest scale:\nV,SF\nV,SF\nSUINV,O\n(\u03bc0 ) = 0.242(8), SUINV,O\n(\u03bc0 ) = 0.221(9) .\n12\n44\n\n(35)\n\nV,SF\nAs a comparison we quote the value of SUINV,O\n(\u03bc0 ) = 1.11(4) as obtained at \u03b8 = 0\n12\nand p = 2\u03c0/L in our previous work.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have demonstrated how the generalized boundary conditions advocated in ref. [1] can to utilized to define continuous external momenta as often\nneeded in the lattice simulations when operators with derivatives are considered. We\ninvestigated the particular example of a scale dependent renormalization constant\nfor renormalizing twist-2 non-singlet quark operators corresponding to moments of\nparton distribution functions.\n\n20\n\n\fAlthough we demonstrated the usefulness for such momentum definitions for a\nrenormalization constant, or more specific its step scaling function, it is clear that\nin principle the same method also applies to matrix elements themselves, as long as\nno real physical momentum transfer is involved. The feasibility of this approach has\nto be tested, however, in a real numerical benchmark simulation.\nFor the particular example at hand, we could determine the renormalization constant for a certain lattice representation of a continuum operator that determines\nthe average (quark) momentum in a hadron. Such a calculation would have been\nvery difficult by using standard, quantized lattice momenta as usually taken. As\na result, we could determine the RG invariant step scaling function for two different lattice representations of the same continuum operator. In this way, we could\neliminate a small systematic uncertainty that plagued our earlier work.\nThe idea of the present work was to show the practicability and usefulness of\nthe generalized momentum definition on a practical example. The values of the\nRG invariant step scaling we have computed are essential ingredients for the RG\ninvariant matrix elements which allow a comparison with experimental data or global\nfits.

For small couplings the \u03b2-function and the anomalous dimension (\u03b3-function),\ndefined by\n\u2202\n\u03b2(g) =\u03bc g(\u03bc)\n\u2202\u03bc\n(36)\n\u2202\n\u03b3(g) =\u03bc\nlog ZO (\u03bc, g)\n\u2202\u03bc\nhave asymptotic expansions of the form\ng\u21920\n\n\u03b2(g) \u223c \u2212 g\ng\u21920\n\n\u03b3(g) \u223c \u2212 g\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\u221e\nX\n\nbk g 2k ,\n(37)\n2k\n\n\u03b3k g .\n\nk=0\n\nOne finds that b0 , b1 and \u03b30 are the same in all the schemes (these are the \"universal\" coefficients), while all other coefficients are scheme dependent. The universal\ncoefficients are given by (with CF = (Nc2 \u2212 1)/2Nc and Nc the number of colors)\n\b 11\n2\nNc \u2212 Nf (4\u03c0)\u22122 ,\n3\n3\n16\n=\nCF (4\u03c0)\u22122 ,\n3\n\b 34 2\n13\nNc \u2212 ( Nc \u2212 Nc\u22121 )Nf (4\u03c0)\u22124 .\n=\n3\n3\n\nb0 =\n\n(38)\n\n\u03b30\n\n(39)\n\nb1\n\n24\n\n(40)\n\n\fAny two mass independent renormalization schemes can be related by a scale change\nand a finite parameter renormalization of the form\n\u03bc\u2032 = c\u03bc,\nc > 0,\nq\n\u1e21 \u2032 = \u1e21 Xg (\u1e21),\n\nZ \u2032 = Z[\u2206ZO (\u1e21)],\n\n(41)\n(42)\n(43)\n\nwhere c is just a change of scale between the 2 schemes and one could obviously\nchoose also c = 1. Xg and \u2206ZO are expanded according to\n\u1e21\u21920\n\nXg (\u1e21) \u223c 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nXg(k) \u1e21 2k .\n\n(44)\n\nk=1\n\n\u1e21\u21920\n\n\u2206ZO (\u1e21) \u223c 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(k)\n\n\u2206ZO \u1e21 2k .\n\n(45)\n\nk=1\n\nThe invariance of a physical observable under such a change of parameters, gives a\nrelation between the renormalization group functions, \u03b2 and \u03b3, in the 2 schemes. In\nparticular we have\n(1)\n\u03b31 = \u03b31MS + 2b0 \u2206ZO \u2212 \u03b30 Xg(1) .\n(46)\nFrom ref. [22] we have\nXg(1) = \u2212\n\n1\n(c1,0 + c1,1 Nf ),\n4\u03c0\n\n(47)\n\nwith\nc1,0 = 1.25563(4),\n\nc1,1 = 0.039863(2).\n\n(48)\n(1)\n\nFrom the perturbative results in [16] (section 2.1) it is possible to obtain \u2206ZO .\n\n25\n\n\fReferences\n[1] K.
