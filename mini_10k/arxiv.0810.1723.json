In particular, field surveys like the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS; Gunn & Weinberg 1995), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS;\nSkrutskie et al. 1997), and the Deep Near Infrared Survey (DENIS; Epchtein 1997)\nhelped raise the number of brown dwarf (L and T type) identifications today to over 600\n(Gelino et al. 2008). However the number of brown dwarfs identified as companions to\nmain sequence stars remain few. At the time of this writing, there are only a handful of\nbrown dwarfs confirmed as companions to main sequence stars. Brown dwarfs that are\npart of stellar systems are particularly interesting because they often yield insights into\nbrown dwarf and planet formation around stars. For instance, statistics on the frequency\nof brown dwarf companions may shed light on the differences between planet, brown dwarf,\nand star formation. And unlike the case of discovered field brown dwarfs, the presence of a\ncentral star often reveals additional information on the presumably co-evolved brown dwarf\n\u2013 information like distance, metallicity, and age.\nA number of high-contrast surveys have attempted to improve our knowledge of the\nmoderate to wide separation (40AU to a few hundred AU) substellar companion population\naround stars. For example, Biller et al. (2007) and Metchev & Hillenbrand (2004) each\nsurveyed samples (45 targets, 101 targets) of young (age .250 Myr, .400 Myrs), relatively\nnearby (.50 pc, .160 pc) stars using adaptive optics (AO) systems on the VLT and\nPalomar/Keck telescopes, respectively; Lowrance et al. (2005) used HST NICMOS to\nsurvey 45 young (median age \u223c150 Myr), nearby (average distance \u223c30 pc) stars for\nsubstellar companions; Lafreni\u00e8re et al. (2007) used Gemini AO to observe 85 young\n(median age \u223c150 Myr), nearby (average distance \u223c22 pc) stars; Carson et al. (2005, 2006)\nused Palomar AO to survey 80 nearby (median distance \u223c17 pc) stars with unknown ages.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThese references represent some of the larger direct-imaging high-contrast surveys, but\nthere are a number of other surveys as well.\nThe observations described in this document largely provide an extension to Carson\net al. (2005), although the new target list is focused more strongly on solar-type stars.\n(The Carson et al. [2005, 2006] survey looked mostly at K and M-dwarfs.) Most of the\ncompeting surveys (like Biller et al. 2007, Metchev & Hillenbrand 2004, Lowrance et al.\n2005, Lafreni\u00e8re et al. 2007, and others) have focused on observing the youngest nearby\nstars. While this allows for a maximal substellar-object self-luminosity (Baraffe et al. 2003),\nit inherently requires that one examines stars at somewhat larger distances, in order to\nachieve a large enough original sample to glean the youngest stars. Surveying only younger\nstars also leads to selection biases, as certain types of stars lend themselves better to age\ndeterminations than others (Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008). For our survey, we avoid age\nrequirements in an effort to achieve a more uniform census of the substellar companion\npopulation around the nearest solar-type stars.\nWhile explorations of the substellar space around nearby FGK stars are scientifically\ninteresting in their own right, they also provide important reconnaissance observations\nfor the next generation of planet-search imaging surveys, like expected programs with\nSubaru (HiCIAO; Tamura et al. 2006), Palomar (Project 1640; Hinkley et al. 2008),\nVLT (SPHERE; Beuzit et al. 2008), Gemini (GPI; Macintosh et al. 2006), and potential\nspace missions like Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph (TPF-C)1 and Terrestrial Planet\nFinder Interferometer (TPF-I)2 /Darwin3 . Information on the presence of brown dwarfs\nis important for these future planet surveys because the existence of an orbiting brown\n1\n\nhttp://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF-C\n\n2\n\nhttp://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF-I\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/science/darwin\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndwarf may affect the likelihood of there being a planet in that system. Even for southern\nhemisphere future planet searches, whose targets may not overlap with this document's\nsurvey, the statistical information (from our suvey and others) on brown dwarf frequencies\nmay help guide southern surveys' overall target selection strategy. In addition to information\non orbiting brown dwarfs, future surveys will also benefit from our survey's reports on\ndiscovered field objects close to nearby stars. Such information will ensure that future\nsurveys do not spend unnecessary time following up these field objects for common proper\nmotion tests. This information will also guide target selection, by providing information on\nfield objects whose interfering light might adversely affect high-contrast sensitivities.\nIn the sections below we present techniques and results of our recently completed\nsurvey. Section 2 presents our target sample. Section 3 describes our observing techniques.\nIn section 4 we present the data analysis techniques we used for this survey. In section\n5 we summarize our survey sensitivities. Section 6 describes our results. We present our\nconclusions in section 7.\n\n2.\n\nTargets\n\nOur target selection process had its origins in work being carried out at Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory to select potential candidates for the proposed TPF-C mission (Levine et al.\n2006). The main constraints for that selection process included FGK V spectral type, no\nknown stellar multiplicity, closeness (<20 pc), and visible brightness (V . 7). For optimal\nobservations from Palomar Observatory, we set a declination lower limit of -5 deg. We also\nremoved any targets from our list that were already observed during the Cornell High-Order\nAdaptive Optics Survey (CHAOS; Carson et al. 2005) and other adaptive optics imaging\nprograms, as determined by a standard literature search. We confirmed systems' lack of\nmultiplicity by on-telescope preliminary imaging. One target, GJ 564, had a previously\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\npublished brown dwarf binary companion (Potter et al. 2002). This fact eluded us in our\ninitial literature search and preliminary imaging. Hence, we ended up observing this target\nand recording its current astrometry.\nOur final target list consisted of 21 main sequence stars. This included 2 F stars,\n14 G stars, and 5 K stars. All stars possessed well-characterized proper motion and\nparallax values as defined by Hipparcos (Perryman et al. 1997). As nearby stars, they\ntypically possessed high proper motion (median target proper motion \u223c 600 mas yr\u22121 ), thus\nfacilitating an efficient common proper motion follow-up strategy for candidate companions.\nA complete list of the target set is given in Table 1.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nObservations\n\nCoronagraphic Search Observations\n\nTo conduct our survey, we used the PALAO system (Troy et al. 2000) and the\naccompanying PHARO science camera (Hayward et al. 2001) installed on the Palomar 200\ninch Hale Telescope. PALAO provided us with the high resolution (FWHM typically \u223c\n0.14\u2032\u2032 in Ks and strehl ratio around 50%) necessary for resolving close companions. The\naccompanying PHARO science camera (wavelength sensitivity 1\u20132.5 \u03bcm and plate scale 40\nmas pixel\u22121 ) provided us with a coronagraphic imaging capability, along with a maximal\nfield of view (\u223c30\u2032\u2032 ). Our general observing strategy was to align the coronagraphic mask\non a target star and take a series of Ks exposures, being careful to not saturate many pixels\nin the detector. (Occasionally, we saturated at the edges of the coronagraphic mask, where\nhigh noise levels already prevented any meaningful companion search.) We chose the Ks\nband because it provides high strehl ratios and a favorable relative flux between substellar\ncompanion and parent star. We planned our individual exposure times and number of\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nexposures per set to allow for no more than \u223c 5 minutes (including overheads) between\nany target frame and the nearest sky image. This helped ensure that sky conditions did\nnot significantly change between the target exposures and accompanying sky exposures.\nThe sky exposures consisted of our taking, before and after the target sequence, and with\nthe same setup as the target sequence, dithered images of a nearby empty sky region. We\nspent a comparable amount of time on sky as we did on target. We repeated the process\nof sky-target-sky as many times as was appropriate, with the goal of being able to detect\n(at 5-sigma) an \u223c 18-mag (Ks ) object at 5\u2032\u2032 separation from the primary star. Once we\ncompleted the target/sky sets, we inserted a neutral density filter in the optical path and\nconducted dithered non-coronagraphic exposures of the target star. These images allowed\nus to characterize and record instrument and site observing conditions. Table 1 gives the\nrelevant observing information for the individual targets.\n\n3.2.\n\nCommon Proper Motion Observations\n\nFor candidate companions detected in the previous procedures, we checked for physical\ncompanionship by using common proper motion observations. The nearby stars we\nobserved tend to have high proper motions (on the order of a few hundred mas yr\u22121 ). The\nvast majority of false candidate companions are background stars that tend to have very\nsmall proper motions compared to the parent star. Therefore, after recording our initial\nmeasurement, we waited for a timespan long enough for the parent star to move a detectable\ndistance from the original position. In practice, this observable motion ended up being a\nminimum of \u223c 3 pixels. After taking the second epoch observations, we checked whether\nthe candidate maintained the same position with respect to the parent star. Target stars\nre-observed to check for common proper motion included GJ 895.4, 159, 230, 1095, 1085,\n56.5, and 788. GJ 778 and 758 contained candidate companions, but were not re-observed\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndue to scheduling constraints (see discussion in Section 6).\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nData Analysis\nReducing Images\n\nWe began our data reduction by median-combining each of the dithered sky sets. We\nthen took each coronagraphed star image and subtracted the median-combined sky taken\nclosest in time to the star image. (The typical separation in time between target and sky\nimage was \u223c5.5 minutes.) We divided each of the sky-subtracted star images by a flat-field\nframe that we created, using standard procedures, from dark-frames and the dithered sky\nsets. We chose to use sky-flats, instead of the more conventional twilight or dome flats,\nin order to have a flat-field frame generated with an optical path most similar to that\nused with the target observation. We felt that this was important because we have seen\ntransmission features (which we suspect reside on PHARO's moveable optics) that change\ntheir observable position (by a few pixels perhaps) over the course of the night.\nAfter performing the flat-fielding, we next median-combined each sequence of\ncoronagraphic star frames. For this median combination, we used the images' residual\nparent star flux (which leaked from around the coronagraph) to realign any frames that\nmay have shifted because of instrument flexure. (Typical re-alignments were . 1 pixel.)\nWe concluded that in-software re-alignment produced better overall sensitivities than\njust throwing-out mis-aligned frames. Next we applied a bad-pixel algorithm to remove\nsuspicious pixels (defined as any pixel deviating from the surrouding 8 pixels by \u22655 \u03c3) and\nreplace them with the median of their 8 neighbors.\nWe next applied a Fourier filter to the resulting images to help remove non-point-like\nfeatures such as unwanted internal instrument reflection and residual parent star flux. The\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nFourier filter application entailed our multiplying a Fourier-transformed version of the final\nimage by an exponential transmission function that minimized lower frequency signals.\nThis Fourier filter, described in (Carson et al. 2005), has been shown to improve S/N by\n\u223c 25% for a typical PHARO high-contrast image. Along with this S/N improvement, the\ntypical point spread function (PSF) FWHM decreased by about 10% as a result of the\nFourier filter application.\nFinally, we investigated possibilities for taking advantage of the approximate symmetry\nof the coronagraphed PSF to self-subtract an inverted and/or rotated version of the PSF\nfrom the non-inverted image. We ended up deciding against using this technique as the\nfinal improvement was either marginal or non-existent.\n\n4.2.\n\nIdentifying Brown Dwarf Companions\n\nOur first step in identifying candidate brown dwarf companions was to individually\ninspect each final Fourier-filtered and non-Fourier-filtered image for any potential\ncompanions. By choosing to examine both Fourier-filtered and non-Fourier-filtered final\nimages, we effectively recognize that the filtering technique improves S/N in some instances\nand worsens it in others. For instance, Fourier-filtering works best in regions with shallowly\nsloping unwanted signal, like regions with internal instrument reflection. However, in other\nregions, the candidate companion S/N may suffer since the filtering always removes some\ntrue candidate companion flux.\nThe Palomar AO characteristic PSF \"waffle pattern\" (see Figure 1) is often seen as\nundesirable by observers, as the pattern degrades the potential PSF sharpness. While this\nis true in principle, the characteristic \"waffle pattern\", in practice, provided an important\nway for us to distinguish true celestial objects (which had a well-patterned four-cornered\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nPSF) from statistical outliers in the image noise, which typically took on more arbitrary\nshapes. Thus, it provided an important first step in candidate companion identification.\nWhile individual inspection of waffle patterns proved useful, we chose to also use an\nautomated detection system to deliver more quantifiable sensitivity levels. Our automated\nalgorithm operated by centering on every other pixel in the final reduced Fourier-filtered and\nnon-Fourier-filtered image and creating there a 0.\u2032\u2032 16 diameter flux aperture and 1.\u2032\u2032 2-1.\u2032\u20326\ndiameter sky annulus. After subtracting the background, the algorithm approximated a\nS/N level by dividing the measured aperture flux by the combined aperture flux Poisson\nnoise and background noise; it approximated background noise from the standard deviation\nof the sky annulus pixels. In the end it outputted a final array with a S/N value for each\nsampled pixel. For each S/N map, there was also generated a map of measured background\nnoise at each position (as estimated from the sky annuli). This outputted noise map\nessentially reflected the ability of the algorithm to detect (at a given thresh-hold S/N level)\ndifferent brightness objects according to position on the array.\nAfter generating maps for a given image, the program selected the S/N map pixel with\nthe highest value, using a minimum value of five. It recorded the pixel position and then\nmoved on to record the next highest S/N value greater than five. After each detection, it\nvoided a 0.\u2032\u2032 4 radius around the detected candidate object. This procedure continued until\nthere were no more positions with S/N values greater or equal to five. (Of course, for many\nimages, no positions possessed S/N levels greater than five.) After the algorithm identified\nthe candidate sources, we re-examined the final images to ensure that the algorithm had\nindeed detected a true source as opposed to a systematic effect. Again, we searched for\nthe Palomar adaptive optics signature \"waffle pattern\" to ensure a true physical source.\nWe also made comparisons to images taken at other sources to ensure that the feature was\nindeed unique to the target image. In practice, we found that individual image inspection,\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nby eye, produced the most thorough identification of candidate companions. However, we\nfelt that the automated detection was important as well, in order to provide quantifiable\ndetection sensitivities, as well as a second-check for our visual inspections.\nWe acknowledge that the use of our automated detection routine has some drawbacks.\nNotably, there are instances where the algorithm over-estimates noise levels. For instance,\nclose to the parent star PSF, the algorithm can mistake what may be a well-ordered parent\nstar PSF slope for a random fluctuation in background noise. Additionally, the algorithm\nmay also over-estimate the noise close to field stars; if a field star happens to fall in the\nsky annulus, the algorithm will determine that region to have excessively high background\nnoise. Thus, only the brightest candidate objects would be detected near these field star\npositions. While these instances are not ideal, we conclude that is an acceptable compliment\nto our careful visual inspections. In Section 5 we discuss how we may generate limiting\nmagnitudes and brown dwarf mass limits from these algorithm-generated noise maps.\nIn cases where we positively identified a potential brown dwarf companion, we next\nestimated its apparent Ks magnitude by comparing its flux to the non-coronagraphic\nparent-star calibration images and published 2MASS K-magnitudes (Skrutskie et al. 1997).\nResulting magnitudes are displayed in Table 2. Once we established an apparent Ks\nmagnitude, we derived a corresponding absolute Ks magnitude, assuming the candidate had\na distance equal to the parent system. Thanks to observational surveys such as Hipparcos\n(Perryman et al. 1997), all of our parent stars had well-defined parallaxes and therefore\ndistances. With an approximate absolute Ks magnitude in hand, we combined published\nbrown dwarf observational data (Leggett et al. 2000, Leggett et al. 2002, Burgasser et al.\n1999, Burgasser et al. 2000, Burgasser et al. 2002, Burgasser et al. 2003, Geballe et al.\n2002, Zapatero et al. 2002, Cuby et al. 1999, Tsvetanov et al. 2000, Strauss et al. 1999,\nand Nakajima et al. 1995) with theoretical data from Baraffe et al. (2003) to extrapolate\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nconstraints on the object's mass. An object whose potential mass fell within acceptable\nbrown dwarf restrictions was designated for common proper motion follow-up observations.\nFor our follow-up observations, we used Hipparcos published common proper motion\nvalues (Hipparcos catalogue; Perryman et al. 1997) to determine the expected movement of\nthe parent system. Since background and field stars are unlikely to possess proper motions\nidentical to the parent system's, we used common proper motion as a strong support for\na physical companionship. For candidate companions, we used the PSF central peak to\nidentify position. For the obscured parent star, we used the waffle-pattern four corners\n(which resided outside the opaque coronagraph spot) to create a well-defined cross-hairs\nthat revealed the central position. We could typically constrain the relative offset between\nparent star and candidate companion by fractions of a pixel, depending on S/N levels.\nMeasuring the candidate companion's relative position over the two epochs, we were able to\ndistinguish physical companionships from chance alignments. We record positions in Table\n2.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nSurvey Sensitivities\n\nDetermining Limiting Magnitudes\n\nTo quantify detection sensitivities from the algorithm-generated noise maps described\nin Section 4.2, we looked to determine the faintest detectable magnitude as a function of\nangular separation from each parent star. We began by sampling each noise map (including\nthose deriving from Fourier-filtered and non-Fourier-filtered images) and selecting, for each\npixel, the smaller of the two noise values. The resulting composite noise map array therefore\nreflected the best sensitivities from each of the two final images. Figure 2 displays a sample\nimage sequence, where a Fourier-filtered and non-Fourier-filtered image are combined to\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\ncreate a composite noise map.\nFor the composite noise map, we next determined the median values in a series of\nconcentric 0\u2032\u2032 .20-thick rings centered on the noise map center. The median values therefore\nrepresented typical noise as a function of distance from the central star. For each noise\nvalue, we then determined the minimum apparent Ks -magnitude where signal exceeded\nthe combined Poisson noise and ring noise by a factor greater or equal to 5; we were able\nto convert noise values (in units of detector counts) to Ks -magnitudes using parent star\ncalibration data described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 we plot resulting measurements for\nmedian survey sensitivities (middle curve), the best 10% of observations (lower curve), and\nthe worst 10% of observations (top curve). Refer to Table 3 for a summary of minimum\ndetectable magnitudes for each of the individual targets.\nAnother commonly used statistic for describing sensitivities for high-contrast companion\nsurveys is the limiting differential magnitude as a function of angular separation from the\nparent star. In other words, how many times dimmer may a companion object be before\nwe lose it in the parent star noise? Figure 4 plots differential magnitudes for median survey\nsensitivities as well as the best and worst 10% of observations.\n\n5.2.\n\nMass Sensitivities\n\nDetermining sensitivities according to companion mass is complicated by the fact that\nbrown dwarfs of a given mass dim over time. Nonetheless, to get a general idea of detectable\nmasses, we may assume different test ages and then use models by Baraffe et al. (2003) to\ntransform our minimum detectable brightnesses into brown dwarf masses. Figure 5 shows a\ncomparison of median sensitivities assuming 1 Gyr, solar age, and 10 Gyr target ages.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n6.\n\nResults\n\nAfter conducting all of our data analysis, we concluded that zero systems showed\npositive evidence of a brown dwarf companion (that was not previously known). We did\nre-detect the brown dwarf binary orbiting GJ 564, discovered by Potter et al. (2002). In\ntotal, we detected 48 field objects (including the binary brown dwarf) around 10 targets\nstars. The GJ 778 and GJ 758 fields both contained candidate companions, but were\nnot re-observed for common proper motion follow-up tests due to scheduling constraints.\n2MASS data (Skrutskie et al. 1997) reports K-band field star densities of \u223c12 stars and \u223c6\nstars per PHARO field of view, for the respective GJ 778 and GJ 758 star neighborhoods.\nGiven the relatively high field star densities for these regions, the chances of these candidates\nbeing field stars are high. In the end, however, we cannot confirm or reject that one of these\ncandidates may be a brown dwarf companion. Instead, we simply report the photometry\nand astrometry for the detected objects. Table 2 presents the measurements for these\nobjects as well as all the other field objects detected in our survey.\n\n7.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, our survey found no evidence of new brown\ndwarf companions, for orbital separations akin to our own outer solar system. However,\neven for targets with no candidate companions, we cannot rule out the possibility that one\nor more new brown dwarfs exist around the targeted stars, even at the semi-major axes for\nwhich our survey is most sensitive. For instance, a substellar companion near conjuction, in\nan orbit close to edge-on, may be impossible to resolve from the parent star PSF, regardless\nof the companion's luminosity or semi-major axis. Furthermore, even for a bright brown\ndwarf with a face-on orbital inclination, a brown dwarf's orbital eccentricity might lead to\na range of possible projected separations, which could lead to a null detection.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nExtracting rigorous companion statistics is therefore complicated by factors such as\nunknown orbital characteristics. For example, if typical brown dwarf orbits are highly\neccentric, the typical semi-major axis regime that our survey covers is most likely narrower\nthan the projected orbital separation we probe, as shown in orbital simulations presented in\nCarson et al. (2006). Furthermore, extracting the companion fraction for a given substellar\nmass range is complicated by the fact that one must assume a system age in order to\ntranslate the survey sensitivity floor (in terms of Ks mag) into a minimum detectable mass\n(see discussion in Section 5.2). Since most of our stars have unknown ages, to extract a\ncompanion fraction, one must resort to a statistical inference of target star ages, using a\nmethod such as galactic birth models (like that used in Burgasser 2004) or stellar metallicity\nrelations (like that used in Carson et al. 2006). (Alternative age determination methods,\nsuch as those using Ca II emission, lithium abundance, and X-ray activity, provide poor\nconstraints for target sets older than a couple hundred Myrs, and are therefore not useful\nfor our applications.)\nThe extractable companion frequency also depends on the relative mass function of\nsubstellar companions. For example, even if we limit ourselves to a constrained mass\nrange (like 20 MJ to 40 MJ ), the companion fraction uncertainties may depend sensitively\non whether the majority of brown dwarfs resides near the lower boundary or the higher\nboundary of our mass range; if the majority resides near the lower mass boundary, there is\na greater chance that our null result is due to limiting sensitivities, as opposed to a true\nlack of companions.\nIt is possible for one to make educated assumptions for all of the aforementioned\nfactors, and then run detailed Monte Carlo population simulations to conclude a companion\nfraction (e.g. Nielsen et al. 2008, Carson et al. 2006). Published Monte Carlo population\nanalyses have shown that a large target data set (& 60 stars) is typically required to provide\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nmeaningful results. For instance, Carson et al. (2006), using an 80 star sample, concludes\na brown dwarf companion (25-100 AU semi-major axis) fraction of 0% to 9%. Nielsen et\nal. (2008) concludes, from a 60 star sample, a planet/brown-dwarf (> 4 MJ ) companion\n(20-100 AU semi-major axis) fraction of 0% to 20%. Considering these relatively large\nuncertainties, and that our 21 star sample is significantly smaller than these other surveys,\nwe believe that we cannot conclude meaningful companion fractions from our data set\nalone. We postpone, for a future paper, a detailed Monte Carlo population analysis that\ncombines several surveys' data sets to derive the most meaningful companion fractions.\nIn addition to explorations of brown dwarf companions, our survey also reported\nastrometry and photometry for all detected field objects. The reporting of such objects may\nhave potential benefits to future surveys, by providing possible reference star candidates,\npreventing future brown dwarf candidate false identifications, and yielding data on objects\nwhose interfering light might impede future planet-search observations.\n\nWe thank the Palomar Observatory staff for their support of these observations.

We transformed these K-short magnitudes into masses using Hipparcos distances and Baraffe et al. (2003) evolutionary models.
