These anomalies include an alignment of the moments in the lowest multipoles\n1\n\nE-mail: ahmet@physics.umn.edu\nE-mail: c.contaldi@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nE-mail: peloso@physics.umn.edu\n2\n\n1\n\n\fdubbed the 'axis of evil', an asymmetry in the power between the northern and southern ecliptic hemispheres\nand an apparently non-Gaussian excursion in the southern galactic hemisphere known as the 'cold-spot'.\nAnother well-known puzzle in the observations has been the lack of power in the quadrupole which had also\nbeen noted in the COBE-DMR maps [3] and is still present in the latest WMAP data [4].\nThe significance of the anomalies has been debated extensively in the literature (see e.g. [5]) with some\nreported effects more significant than others. The difficulty in quantifying exactly the importance of any\neffect is due to how correctly the a posteriori probability of observing it is estimated. It is clear however\nthat the anomalies implying an overall anisotropy in the data are more significant than the lack of power\nin the CMB quadrupole. A natural explanation for the observed anomalies may be some form of as yet\nundetermined systematic or foreground signal which is not being taken into account properly in the data\nreduction producing the final maps [6]. However, a conclusive explanation along these lines has not been\nput forward yet. It is therefore legitimate to ask whether the observed anomalies may be an indication of a\ndeparture from the standard cosmological model. In order to find convincing evidence on such deviations,\none should study the CMB properties predicted by any specific model, with a particular emphasis on those\nwhich go beyond the ones characterizing the standard picture. For instance, if the signal is statistically\nanisotropic, crucial information will be encoded in the off-diagonal correlations of the spherical harmonic\nmodes with halm a\u22c6l\u2032 m\u2032 i 6 \u221d \u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4mm\u2032 , which are predicted to vanish in the standard case.\nSince, aside the anomalies [2], CMB data strongly support the general theory of inflation, we focus here\non departures from the standard picture which can however be reconciled with the inflationary framework.\nFor example, the low quadrupole power has motivated a number of studies to explain the observed cut-off\nwithin the context of inflation [7, 8, 9, 10] (ref. [11] further extended the model [7], to account for a spatial\nasymmetry of the CMB perturbations at large scales). These models assume a short period of inflation,\nleading to a fine tuning problem in the standard inflationary picture since the slow-roll regime responsible\nfor the observed N \u223c 60 or so e-folds is an attractor in the inflaton phase space and thus the probability of\ninflating for a large number of e-folds is much larger than that of inflating for only 60. 4 Recently, other\ngroups have argued that inflation should be short-lived [13] and in particular models of inflation on the\nstring theory landscape seem to predict a highly suppressed probability of large N [14]. Coupled to the fact\nthat our observed universe requires N \u2248 60, these arguments imply that inflation must have lasted 'just\nlong enough'. Theoretical arguments aside, a limited amount of inflation would certainly lead to a richer\nphenomenology than a prolonged one. The reason why inflation was originally postulated is that it leads to\nthe isotropic and homogeneous Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe starting from rather generic\ninitial conditions. If inflation lasted many e-folds, then any trace of the pre-existing universe is inflated\naway to scales much larger than the present day horizon. On the other hand, a limited amount of inflation\ncould have left some trace in the data, particularly at large scales, that would appear as anomalies within\nthe standard inflationary picture.\nWith these considerations in mind, in this work we perform an initial step towards the study of the\nCMB anisotropies taking into account a pre-existing phase before inflation, in which the universe is not yet\nof the FRW type. Motivated by the suggested alignment of the large scale multipoles along a common axis,\nwe focus on models which are anisotropic at the onset of inflation. For simplicity, we still assume that the\nuniverse is homogeneous. As we will see, even this very minor departure from standard cosmology requires a\nsignificant extension of the well consolidated framework for the computation of CMB anisotropies in a FRW\nuniverse. Homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies have long ago been classified into equivalence classes\nknown as the Bianchi types [15]. With the possible exception of type IX, Bianchi universes with a positive\ncosmological constant evolve towards an asymptotic (isotropic) de Sitter stage [16]. The situation is more\ncomplicated when the cosmological constant is replaced by an inflaton field (which one has to do, in order\nto have a finite amount of inflation). Also in this case, however, one finds that inflation takes place for a\n4\n\nSee however other inflation models that naturally suppress the overall number of e-folds, e.g. [12].\n\n2\n\n\fwide variety of circumstances, leading to the isotropization of the space. 5\nIt was shown in [18] that a late time contribution of the Bianchi V IIh form to the temperature\nanisotropies can account for several of the WMAP anomalies; more in general, Bianchi models with generalized backgrounds driven by anisotropic stresses have been studied extensively in the literature (see e.g.\n[19, 20]). These models require a particular mechanism actively driving the anisotropy, which can for this\nreason survive for a much longer period than in the case considered here (and, possibly, result in stronger\nobservational effects). In this work we consider only the case consistent with the simplest models of inflation\nwhere the background is initially anisotropic and is isotropized at the onset of inflation. 6 We expect to\nrecover a standard power spectrum at the scales that leave the horizon after the isotropization has been\nachieved, but nonconventional results at larger scales. 7\nThus, the anisotropy is restricted to the initial conditions, in the form of a power spectrum of the primordial perturbations which depends also on the directionality of the modes, and not only on the magnitude\nof their momentum k (as in the isotropic case). On the contrary, the transfer functions, relating the late\ntime temperature anisotropies to the primordial perturbations, are the standard ones, since the propagation\nof the modes, soon after the onset of inflation, occurs in an isotropic background. This simplifies greatly\nthe calculation of the correlations induced in the CMB. 8 We present this computation in Section 2, in the\ncase in which there is a residual anisotropy between two of the three spatial directions.\nNamely, we compute the correlation between different CMB modes, under the assumption that (i)\nthe primordial perturbations are Gaussian, and (ii) their power spectrum depends on the magnitude |k|\nand on the angle between the momentum and the anisotropic direction. We do not impose any further\nassumption in this computation, so that it holds for any Bianchi model with a residual 2d isotropy and an\nasymptotic standard inflationary behaviour. As we anticipated a few paragraphs above, the main result is\na non vanishing correlation between off diagonal modes, see eq. (7). The specific relations found between\nthe different non vanishing correlators can in principle allow for a detailed data analysis within any given\nmodel. We do not perform this analysis in the present work (since, as we mentioned, our main result is\nthe extension of the computation of the primordial perturbations to such non FRW geometries); however\nwe include the relations (7), since they offer a model oriented way of extracting information from the CMB\ndata. This information is lost in the standard diagonal Cl statistic analysis. The observed correlations\ncan be fit with model-independent templates (see e.g. [27, 1]) but these are not calculated a priori from\nany particular theory and thus the information contained in the CMB will not constrain any fundamental\nparameter.\nIn the remainder of the work, we present the detailed computation of the primordial perturbations within\na Bianchi I model with a residual 2d isotropy, which is the simplest deviation from the FRW geometry. The\nline element is of the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a (t)2 dx2 + b (t)2 dy 2 + dz 2 ,\n(1)\nand late time isotropy (a = b) is achieved due to an inflaton scalar field \u03c6 . In Section 3 we study the\nbackground evolution for this model, under the assumption that the inflaton is initially in a slow roll\nregime. As it is well known, the anisotropy is rapidly damped away, on a timescale corresponding to the\n5\n\nA list of works discussing this issue, and several aspects of inflation in Bianchi models can be found in the review [17].\nWe also assume that the only source is the inflaton field. Ref. [21] studied the background evolutions in cases in which an\nanti-symmetric tensor is also dynamically relevant.\n7\nRef. [22] studied the perturbations of a scalar field assuming that a small anisotropy (corresponding to the ratio h/H in\nour equation (14)) is present during inflation, and that it then decays away at the end of inflation. Such perturbations are then\nconverted into metric perturbations through the mechanism of modulated perturbations [23]. This work presents analytical\nresults for the perturbations using an expansion series in the anisotropy parameter, which, in our context, is valid for modes\nleaving the horizon towards the end of the anisotropic phase.\n8\nThis is in contrast to the case where the anisotropy is present during the evolution of perturbations at any time in the\nradiation through to the present epoch. In this case the Einstein-Boltzmann system must be modified to account for the\nanisotropic evolution of the modes [24, 25, 26].\n6\n\n3\n\n\finverse Hubble rate due to the potential energy of \u03c6 . For this reason, in order to have a sizeable effect,\nwe need to start from a significant anisotropy. The model then admits two possible background solutions\nat early times, according to whether the expansion rate of the scale factor a is greater or smaller than the\none of the scale factor b. In the first case (which we call positive branch), a \u221d t at asymptotically early\ntimes, while b is constant. In the second case (which we call negative branch), the anisotropic direction is\ninitially contracting, a \u221d t\u22121/3 , while the other two directions expand as b \u221d t2/3 . In both cases, the metric\nis singular at t = 0 , and the early time evolution is of the Kasner [28] type.\nIn Section 4 we compute the primordial perturbations about this geometry, by extending to this case the\nMukhanov-Sasaki [29] linearized computation and quantization procedure for the perturbations valid for a\nFRW background. 9 For clarity, we summarize at various stages the results of the isotropic computation [34],\nand we then show how each of them extends to our case. We start by showing that also in the present case\nthere are three physical modes of the perturbations. We see this with a simple counting of modes, which\nholds in the standard case, but which does not rely on the isotropy (nor homogeneity) of the background.\nFor a FRW geometry, the three modes are encoded in a scalar perturbation, and in the two polarizations of a\ntensor mode (gravitational wave). These modes are decoupled at the linearized level, due to the homogeneity\nand isotropy of the background. In our case, only one mode is decoupled, due to the residual 2d isotropy,\nwhile the two remaining ones are coupled to each other. As the background becomes isotropic, the latter two\nbecome the scalar mode, and one of the two tensor polarizations. To extract the physical modes, we choose\na non-conventional gauge that preserves all the g0\u03bc metric perturbations. Such modes are nondynamical,\nand can be readily integrated out. Since there are initially 11 perturbations (symmetric \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b4\u03c6), we\nare left with the 11 \u2212 4(gauge) \u2212 4(nondynamical) = 3 physical modes. Although we perform the explicit\ncomputation only for the Bianchi I model with a residual 2d isotropy, we emphasize that this procedure can\nbe further extended to more general geometries. In the general case, one expects that all the three physical\nmodes are coupled to each other at the linearized level.\nTo compute the power spectrum of these modes, we need to study their early times frequency. In the\nstandard case, the physical frequency is initially dominated by the physical momentum, and it changes\nonly very slowly (adiabatically) due to the expansion of the universe. In conformal time \u03b7, related to the\nphysical time t by dt = a d\u03b7 the (conformal) frequency is actually constant at early times. Therefore, one\ncan consistently start from an adiabatic vacuum in the asymptotic past (this, in turn, leads to a nearly scale\ninvariant primordial power spectrum). The situation is more complicated for the two Bianchi I backgrounds\nthat we have described above; first of all there is some ambiguity in the choice of conformal time (since\none may use different powers of the two scale factors in the definition). This has lead us to study the\ncondition under which two different conformal times can be employed, and result in the same prescription\nfor the initial conditions. We find that, in the negative branch, the frequencies of two coupled modes are\nnot adiabatically evolving at early times; it is possible to find a time variable in which the frequency of\nthe decoupled mode is adiabatically evolving; however, the mode is tachyonic, leading to an instability and\nto a nonlinear regime that prevents us from computing firm predictions for the CMB anisotropies in it.\nFor the positive branch, (a \u221d t, b \u2192 const.), all the three modes are decoupled at asymptotically early\ntimes, and their three frequencies are adiabatically evolving in the conformal time variable \u03b7, defined as\ndt = a b\u03b3 d\u03b7 (where \u03b3 any constant; for simplicity we then choose \u03b3 = 0 in the computation). This allows us\nto consistently start from an adiabatic vacuum. The power spectrum that we obtained approaches isotropy\nfor the modes which exit the horizon right after the universe becomes isotropic. At larger scales, however,\nthe spectrum exhibits an angular dependence, and it actually diverges for momenta that are aligned along\nthe directions which are not expanding at asymptotically early times. As a consequence, a computation\nof the temperature anisotropies requires that we resolve this singularity. In the concluding Section 5, we\n9\n\nPerturbations in Bianchi models have been previously studied in [30] (through the formalism of [31]) and in [32] (through\nthe formalism of [33]). These analyses do not compute the canonical variables of the actions of the perturbations, as instead\ndone in [29] for the FRW case, which, as we shall see, is a necessary step to compute the initial conditions for these modes.\n\n4\n\n\fdiscuss several ways in which this can be done (at the very least, this will occur due to nonlinear effects,\nsince the singularity of the modes indicates a breakdown of the linearized computation). However, all of\nthem require additional input in the computation. We therefore conclude that the Bianchi I model we have\nstudied is too simple to provide firm predictions for the anisotropy, at least in the assumption of initial slow\nroll of the inflaton that we have made in this analysis.\nThe paper is concluded by some Appendixes, where we outline several intermediate steps of the computations.\n\n2\n\nThe alm covariance\n\nIn this Section we compute the statistical correlation between different multipoles of the CMB temperature\nanisotropies, relaxing the usual assumption of statistical isotropy. The starting point is the power spectrum\nR (k)R\u22c6 (k\u2032 ) \u2261\n\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032 )P (k)\nk3\n\n(2)\n\nof the primordial comoving curvature perturbations (we assume that the perturbations are Gaussian). If\nthe background is isotropic, the fluctuations are statistically isotropic, and the power spectrum P depends\nonly on the magnitude of k . In general, it will depend also on its direction.\nIn the following Sections, we restrict our attention to a Bianchi I cosmology. The present computation\nis instead valid for more general anisotropic backgrounds, with the assumptions that (i) there is a residual\nisotropy of two of the three spatial dimensions, and (ii) this anisotropy is damped away during inflation.\nIt is straightforward to generalize the calculation if condition (i) is relaxed. Under these assumptions, the\nprimordial power spectrum depends on the magnitude of k , and on the angle between k and the anisotropic\ndirection. We denote by \u03be the cosine of this angle.\nWe denote by \u03b4T (p\u0302, \u03b70 , x0 ) the temperature perturbation in the direction p\u0302, as measured by an observer\nat position x0 and at conformal time \u03b70 . It is customary to decompose the temperature perturbations that\nwe observe into spherical harmonics:\n\u03b4T (p\u0302, \u03b70 , x0 ) =\n\nX\n\nalm Ylm (p\u0302)\n\n(3)\n\nl,m\n\nSince we are assuming that the perturbations are Gaussian, their statistical properties are still encoded in\nthe second order correlations\n(4)\nCll\u2032 mm\u2032 \u2261 halm a\u22c6l\u2032 m\u2032 i .\nThe correlations however are not diagonal as in the isotropic case.\nIn the linear regime, the temperature anisotropy (3) is given by\n\u03b4T (p\u0302, \u03b70 , x0 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\nR(k, \u03b7i )\u2206(k, k\u0302 * p\u0302, \u03b70 )eik*x0 ,\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the transfer function \u2206(k, k\u0302 * p\u0302) describes the change in amplitude of the radiation perturbation from\nan initial time \u03b7i , which can be taken deep in the radiation dominated era, to today. Since the background\nis isotropic soon after the onset of inflation, the transfer function is also isotropic (in real space). As, a\nconsequence \u2206 depends only on the magnitude of the wavenumber k = |k| of the mode, and on the angle\nbetween k and the line of sight at which the photon is being observed. It is convenient to expand it in a\nbasis of Legendre polynomials:\n\u2206(k, k\u0302 * p\u0302, \u03b70 ) =\n\nX\nl\n\n(\u2212i)l (2l + 1)Pl (k\u0302 * p\u0302)\u2206l (k, \u03b70 ).\n5\n\n(6)\n\n\fWe rotate our coordinate system such that the anisotropic direction lies on the z\u2212axis. Starting from\nthe above expressions, after the algebra outlined in appendix A, we find\nCll\u2032 mm\u2032\n\n=\n\ns\n\n\u2032\n\u03b4mm\u2032\n(2l + 1)(2l\u2032 + 1)(l \u2212 m)!(l\u2032 \u2212 m)!\n(\u2212i)l\u2212l\n\u03c0\n(l + m)!(l\u2032 + m)!\nZ 1\nZ\ndk\nd\u03bePlm (\u03be) Plm\n\u2206l (k, \u03b70 ) \u2206l\u2032 (k, \u03b70 )\n\u00d7\n\u2032 (\u03be) P (k, \u03be) ,\nk\n\u22121\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the Plm are associated Legendre polynomials. The above expression conveys all the statistical information present in the CMB in the axisymmetric anisotropic case. When constraining anisotropic models\nthe full covariance should be compared to the data.\nSome general properties of the correlations follow from Eq. 7.\n(i) The correlations reduce to the standard result in the isotropic case, P (k, \u03be) \u2261 P (k)\n(iso)\nCll\u2032 mm\u2032\n\n2\n= \u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4mm\u2032\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ndk\nP (k) \u2206l (k, \u03b70 )2\nk\n\n(8)\n\nin which different multipoles are uncorrelated. In any realistic model, the power spectrum becomes isotropic\nat small scales (large k), since such modes exit the horizon when the background is isotropic . Small scales\ncorrespond to large l (mathematically, this is due to the transfer functions, which are peaked at increasingly\nlarge k as l increases). Therefore, off-diagonal correlators become progressively smaller as l and l\u2032 increase,\nand the result (7) reduces to the isotropic one. The scale at which this happens is strongly sensitive to the\namount of inflation which takes place after the universe has become isotropic. If this stage is too prolonged,\nthe power spectrum is anisotropic only at too large scales to be observed today, and the isotropic result (8)\nis recovered for all multipoles.\n(ii) The residual 2d isotropy of the background restricts the number of non vanishing correlators. The\nrestriction is mostly manifest in the coordinate system considered here, where the anisotropic direction\ncoincides with the z\u2212axis, and the multipoles are uncorrelated unless m = m\u2032 . For a general orientation\nof the anisotropic direction we find a greater number of non vanishing correlators. However (obviously) the\nnumber of linearly independent correlators remains the same.\n(iii) Bianchi I cosmologies have planar reflection symmetries (x \u2192 \u2212x), and, as a consequence, P (k, \u2212\u03be) =\nP (k, \u03be). In this case, the correlation (7) also vanishes whenever the difference between l and l\u2032 is odd (mathematically, this follows from the parity properties of the associated Legendre polynomials).\nNaturally, the orientation of the anisotropic direction is not expected to be correlated with any local\npreferred direction; for any coordinate system, the orientation can be given in terms of the Euler angles\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3); these are extra free parameters in anisotropic models, which need to be fit to the data in addition\nto the usual physical parameters P determining the radiation transfer function and the spectral parameters\nS determining the primordial power spectrum.\nIn principle, the anisotropic models can be fit to the observed correlations in the data by evaluating a\nlikelihood of the form\n1\nexp \u2212 a\u2020 * C\u22121 * a ,\nL [a|C(P, S, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)] = q\n2\n(2\u03c0)N |C|\n1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(9)\n\nwhere N is the number of modes in the expansion, a is the vector of observed spherical harmonic coefficients\nand C is the model correlation (Eq. 7) between l, m and l\u2032 , m\u2032 pairs. The orientation of the anisotropic\nl\ndirection can be rotated using the spherical harmonic rotation operators Dmm\n\u2032 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) [35]. For the axisymmetric case one of the Euler angles is degenerate and can be marginalized out; this is not the case for\ngeneral anisotropy.\nA full maximum likelihood search of (9) is computationally intensive since the dimensionality of the\nmatrices involved scale as (l + 1)2 . In addition, cut-sky effects complicate the rotation of the data vector\n6\n\n\fwhich is computationally much faster than multiple rotations of the model correlations C. For this reason\nwe postpone any detailed analysis of the likelihood surface and focus here on the framework required to\ncompute the correlations in the axisymmetric anisotropic case. As we will see below, this requires a careful\ntreatment of both the theory of perturbation evolution in an anisotropic background and the early-time\ninitial conditions of the perturbations.\n\n3\n\nThe Background\n\nHere and in the remainder of the paper we focus on a Bianchi I model, with equal expansion rate in two of\nthe three spatial dimensions:\n\u0010\n\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a (t)2 dx2 + b (t)2 dy 2 + dz 2\n\n\u0011\n\n(10)\n\n(contrary to the previous Section, we take the anisotropic direction to coincide with the x-axis). This model\ndescribes an anisotropic universe as long as the ratio between the two different scale factors evolves with time\n(since any constant ratio can be rescaled to one). The two physical quantities characterizing the geometry\nare the two expansion rates\n\u1e03\n\u0227\n, Hb \u2261\n(11)\nHa \u2261\na\nb\nwhere, as usual, dot denotes derivative with respect to physical time t .\nSince we want to study inflation in this background, we consider a scalar field \u03c6, with the potential V .\nThe action of the system is\nS=\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nMp2 Z 4 \u221a\n\u221a\n1\nd x \u2212g R + d4 x \u2212g \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V\n2\n2\n\n(12)\n\nWe decompose the scalar field as \u03c6 = \u03c6 + \u03b4\u03c6, namely in a background quantity \u03c6 (that we take to be\nhomogeneous, as the underlying geometry), plus perturbations \u03b4\u03c6 . In the present Section we discuss the\nbackground evolution, so we only include \u03c6 here. The scalar field perturbations will be considered in the\nremainder of the paper, when we also perturb the background metric (10).\nThe background evolves according to the three independent equations 10\n\u1e22 + 3 H 2 = V /Mp2 ,\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3 H \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032 = 0 ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 1 2\n2\n2\n\u03c6\u0307 + V ,\n3H \u2212 h =\nMp2 2\n\n(13)\n\nHa + 2 Hb\nHa \u2212 Hb\n\u221a\n, h\u2261\n3\n3\n\n(14)\n\nwhere\nH\u2261\n\n(Mp is the reduced Planck mass, while a prime on the potential denotes differentiation with respect to \u03c6).\nThe first two equations are identical to the ones obtained in the isotropic case, in terms of the \"average\"\nexpansion rate H . The third equation, appearing as a \"modified Friedmann equation\", can be then used as\nThe first of (13) is obtained by combining the three nontrivial Einstein equations (namely, 3Eq.00 \u2212 Eq.11 \u2212 2Eq.22 , where Eq.ij\nrefers to the ij Einstein equation), while the third one is the 00 Einstein equation. The second one is the equation for the scalar\nfield (any other linear combination of Eq.00 , Eq.11 , and Eq.22 can be obtained from (13), as a consequence of the 0 component\nBianchi identity).\n10\n\n7\n\n\fan algebraic equation for the difference h between the two expansion rates. By differentiating this equation,\nand by combining it with the other two, one can also find\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nh \u1e23 + 3 H h = 0 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is solved either by h = 0 (isotropic case), or by a time evolving h which is decreasing by a rate set by\nthe average expansion parameter H .\nWe want to study the possible background solutions for this system under the assumption of initial slow\nroll of \u03c6 . Let us first study the approximate case in which V is constant, and the inflaton is at rest (vacuum\nenergy). The first and third of (13) are then solved by\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nV e 2 3V t/Mp + 1\n2 V\ne 3V t/Mp\n\u221a\n\u221a\nH=\u221a\n, h=\u00b1\n, V constant\n(16)\nMp e 2 3V t/Mp \u2212 1\n3 Mp e 2 3V t/Mp \u2212 1\nWe note the presence of two distinct branches of solutions, characterized by either positive or negative values\nof h . In the following, we refer to them as the positive and the negative branch, respectively.\nWe see that the metric has a singularity at t = 0 . Close to the singularity, the system approaches a\nKasner [28] \"vacuum solution\", where the presence of the source (V ) can be neglected. The line element of\nKasner geometries is\nds2Kasner = \u2212dt2 + t2\u03b1 dx2 + t2\u03b2 dy 2 + t2\u03b3 dz 2\n(17)\nwhere the exponents satisfy the two properties \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 = \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 + \u03b3 2 = 1 . In the present case (\u03b2 = \u03b3),\nwe can invert the relations (14), to find, close to the singularity,\n1\n, Hb \u2192 0 ,\nt\n2\n1\n, Hb \u2192\n,\nHa \u2192 \u2212\n3t\n3t\nHa \u2192\n\npositive branch\nnegative branch\n\n(18)\n\nIntegrating these rates reproduces the line element (17) with \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 0 in the positive branch, and\n\u03b1 = \u22121/3, \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 2/3 in the negative branch.\nWe note that the singularity is only a coordinate one for the positive branch, while it is a real one for\nthe negative branch. This can be seen by computing the curvature invariants in both branches; while R is\nfinite at t = 0 in both cases, the product R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 is finite in the positive branch, while it diverges in\nthe negative one. It is possible to perform a change of coordinates in the t, x plane for which the metric is\nregular in the region corresponding to t = 0 . This would select a new time, which could be used for the\nquantization of the perturbations. However, we prefer to choose the time t for the quantization, since the\nbackground is constant on fixed t surfaces. As we will see, this procedure allows us to choose an adiabatic\ninitial vacuum for all modes.\n\u221a\nWe also see from (16) that, for both branches, the system quickly reaches isotropy on a timescale Mp / V\n(which parametrically coincides with the inverse ofqthe Hubble rate due to the vacuum energy), after which\none quickly approaches the de Sitter values H = V /3Mp2 , h = 0 . We note that, in the negative branch,\nthe scale factor of the anisotropic direction experiences a bounce, since it contracts close to the singularity,\nwhile at late times it expands with the asymptotic de Sitter rate.\nLet us now return to the complete system (13). The only restriction that we impose is that the inflaton\n\u03c6 is initially in a slow roll regime. Since h decreases very rapidly, we need to start from a strong anisotropy\nin order to have\n\u221a a measurable deviation from the standard (isotropic) inflationary results. To do so, we\nchoose |h| \u226b V /Mp at the start. In this regime, the average rate H is much greater than in the isotropic\ncase, so that, due to the higher Hubble friction, the inflaton is initially rolling even more slowly than in the\nstandard case. For this reason, the results obtained above for constant V describe very accurately also the\nevolution of the complete system during the isotropization stage.\n8\n\n\fThe degree of accuracy can be checked for any given inflaton potential, by solving the system (13) with\nan expansion series in time. For massive chaotic inflation, with V = m2 \u03c62 /2 , we find\n\"\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nm2 \u03c620 t2\n1\n+ O m4 t4\nH=\n1+\n2\n3t\n2 Mp\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c60\n\n\"\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nm2 t2\n+ O m4 t4\n1\u2212\n4\n\n#\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nm2 \u03c620 t2\n1\n1\u2212\n+ O m4 t4\n, h = \u00b1\u221a\n2\n4 Mp\n3t\n\n#\n\n,\n(19)\n\n(these expansions do not assume m \u226a Mp , although this is the regime of phenomenological interest). In\nfigure 1 we plot the time evolution of the two expansion rates Ha and Hb , and of the inflaton field; the\nleft panel refers to the positive branch, while the right one to the negative branch; V0 denotes the initial\npotential of the inflaton. The evolutions shown (obtained by a numerical integration of the system (13)), are\nin perfect agreement with the above discussion. The background has an initial strong anisotropy (we choose\nh0 = \u00b1106 m in the two branches, respectively), which is rapidly damped away, and it is then followed by\na stage of standard isotropic inflation. Since the inflaton is nearly static in the early anisotropic stage, its\ninitial value controls the duration of the isotropic inflationary expansion. The value \u03c60 = 16 Mp chosen in\nthe figure leads to about 60 e-folds of standard inflation.\nPositive Branch\n\n20\n\nNegative Branch\n\u03c6/Mp\n\n\u03c6/Mp\n15\n\nHa/m\n\n10\n\n5\n\nHb/m\n\nHb/m\nHa/m\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nt (V0)1/2 / Mp\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nt (V0)1/2 / Mp\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 1: Time evolution of the two expansion rates Ha (red-solid) and Hb (green-dashed), in units of m,\nand of the inflaton (blue-dotted), in units of Mp , for a choice of chaotic inflaton potential V = m2 \u03c62 /2.

Notice that for the negative branch Ha starts\nfrom negative values, indicating that this direction is initially contracting.\n\n4\n\nCosmological Perturbations\n\nWe now compute the perturbations about the backgrounds presented in the previous Section.\n\n9\n\n\fIt is useful to recall first the standard results. In presence of a single scalar field (the inflaton) in\na homogeneous and isotropic FRW universe one finds three physical perturbations. These three modes\nare always decoupled from each other, due to the symmetry properties of the background. The actual\ncomputation can be found, among other works, in the comprehensive review [34]. The two polarizations of\nthe tensor mode are denoted by h\u00d7 and h+ . The scalar degree of freedom is instead encoded in the so called\nMukhanov\u2013Sasaki variable v [29], which is in turn related to the comoving curvature perturbation R as\nR=\n\nH\nv\na \u03c6\u0307\n\n(20)\n\nThese quantities are gauge invariant (they do not change under coordinate transformations), and R represents the gravitational potential on comoving hypersurfaces where the inflaton field is homogeneous (this\nproperty defines these hypersurfaces).\nIn the remainder of this Section we discuss the anisotropic case. We do so in three parts. In the first\npart, we show how the isotropic computation can be extended to the anisotropic background presented in\nthe previous Section. We also outline the procedure to further generalize this computation to arbitrary\nanisotropic spaces. In the second part we discuss the initial conditions for the perturbations both in the\npositive and negative branch. We conclude with the computation and the discussion of the curvature power\nspectrum.\n\n4.1\n\nAnisotropic background\n\nThe number of the physical modes can be obtained by a simple counting. We start from 10 perturbations\nin the (symmetric) metric, plus 1 perturbation of the inflaton field. Of these 11 perturbations, 4 are gauge\nmodes, which can be set to zero once we completely fix the freedom of general coordinate reparameterization.\nOf the remaining modes, 4 are nondynamical (namely, they enter with at most one time derivative in\nthe action), and 3 physical. A convenient method to extract the 3 physical modes is to choose a set\nof conditions for the perturbations which fixes the gauge completely (thus removing the 4 gauge modes)\nwithout eliminating any \u03b4g0\u03bc mode. These modes are nondynamical, as can be most easily seen in the ADM\nformalism [36], where the metric elements g00 and g0i are written as Lagrange multipliers. We can therefore\nintegrate them out of the action, as we explicitly show in Appendix B.3 and B.4. 11 We remark that this\ncounting does not assume any symmetry of the 4 dimensional background. Therefore, the procedure that\nwe have just outlined can be applied to more general geometries than the simple Bianchi I considered here.\nWe first performed the computation in conformal time \u03b7, defined as\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7) \u2212d\u03b7 2 + dx2 + b2 (\u03b7) dy 2 + dz 2\n\n\u0011\n\n(21)\n\nWe explain the reason for this choice in the next subsection, where we also discuss how different choices of\ntime can affect the quantization procedure.\nWe denote the physical perturbations about this background by H\u00d7 , H+ , and V , with the understanding\nthat, when the background becomes isotropic, each quantity becomes the corresponding lower case perturbation introduced in the previous subsection. The explicit definition of the physical modes in terms of the\nstarting metric and inflaton perturbations is presented in appendix B. Here we only outline the equations\nsatisfied by these modes, while in the next subsection we give their initial conditions. The form of these\n11\n\nThis is analogous to what happens in electromagnetism. There, one starts from the 4 components of the vector potential.\nOne degree of freedom is eliminated by fixing the U (1) gauge, while the A0 component is non dynamical (it can be fixed by\nGauss' law). One is then left with the 2 physical polarizations of the massless photon. Clearly, one can also choose different\ngauges; for example, a gauge often chosen in the isotropic gravity computation is the longitudinal one, which removes the \u03b4g0i\nmodes. In general, however, the nondynamical modes will be linear combinations of the remaining perturbations, and it may\nbe less straightforward to find them.\n\n10\n\n\fequations is the same for both branches. The mode H\u00d7 is always decoupled from the other two, as a consequence of the residual isotropy in the y \u2212 z plane. The other two modes are coupled to each other. Denoting\nby prime a derivative with respect to conformal time, we find\n\u2032\u2032\n2\nH\u00d7\n+ \u03c9\u00d7\nH\u00d7 = 0\n\nV\nH+\n\n!\u2032\u2032\n\n2\n2\n\u03c912\n\u03c911\n2\n2\n\u03c922\n\u03c912\n\n+\n\n!\n\nV\nH+\n\n!\n\n= 0.\n\n(22)\n\nThe explicit expressions for the frequency elements are given in eqs. (B.23) and (B.32).\nCorrespondingly, the quadratic actions for these modes are formally identical to the action of oscillators in\nMinkowski space with time evolving frequencies. This generalizes the Mukhanov-Sasaki [29] computation,\nvalid in the FRW case: we can then proceed to the quantization of the modes, and provide their initial\nconditions (see the next subsection).\nAs the background becomes isotropic, b \u2192 a, we find\n2\n2\n\u03c9\u00d7\n, \u03c922\n\u2192 k2 \u2212\n2\n\u03c911\n\u2192 k2 \u2212\n2\n\u03c912\n\u21920\n\na\u2032\u2032\na\n\na2 \u03c6\u2032\nz \u2032\u2032\n, z\u2261 \u2032\nz\na\n(23)\n\nwhere k is the comoving momentum. These are the standard evolution equations for the FRW case. All the\nmodes decouple, and the equations for the two tensor polarizations become identical.\n\n4.2\n\nInitial conditions\n\nThe goal of this subsection is to set the initial conditions for the perturbations at asymptotically early initial\ntimes. The key quantities are the frequencies (B.23) and (B.32), which we evaluate at asymptotically early\ntimes through the background relations (19).\nAgain, it is useful to start by summarizing the standard isotropic computation. The physical modes\nh\u00d7 , h+ , v are those that diagonalize the quadratic action for the perturbations. In conformal time, defined\nas\nh\ni\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7) \u2212dt2 + dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2\n(24)\nthe action for each of these modes (after Fourier transforming the spatial coordinates) is of the form\nh\ni\n1\nd\u03b7 d3 k |\u03b4\u2032 |2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 |\u03b4|2\n2\n= k2 \u2212 a2 F (\u03b7)\n\nS(2) =\n\u03c92\n\nZ\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03b4 denotes any of the modes, and F is a time evolving function which is of the order of H 2 . The term\na2 F is exponentially small at asymptotically early times. The net result is that at early times the action of\nthe mode (once written in conformal time) approaches the one of a simple harmonic oscillator in Minkowski\nspacetime, with the frequency equal to the comoving momentum k . In the Minkowski case we would have\ne\u2212ik\u03b7\n\u03b4Mink. = \u221a\n2k\n\n(26)\n\nfor a choice of positive frequency modes.

Going backwards in time, the\nuniverse is nearly exponentially contracting during inflation, and the physical momentum p = k/a becomes\nthe dominant quantity for the evolution of the mode.\nLet us now discuss the anisotropic situation. We separate the comoving momentum k = k1 + k2 , where\nk1 denotes the component along the privileged direction x, and k2 the component in the y \u2212 z plane. We\nalso denote by k1 and k2 the magnitudes of the two components. The magnitude of the physical momentum\nis therefore\nk2 k2\n(28)\np2 = 12 + 22\na\nb\nFor the positive branch, during the anisotropic phase, a \u221d t , while b is nearly constant. As we go\nbackwards in time, only the x direction is \"squeezing\", while the other two become frozen. Correspondingly,\nk1 /a \u226b k2 /b at sufficiently early times, and we therefore expect that only the component of the momentum\nin that direction sets the initial condition. To be able to set an initial vacuum as in the isotropic case, we\ntherefore use the scale factor a in the definition of the conformal time, cf eqs. (21) and (24). Indeed, by\ninserting the early time asymptotic behaviours (19) into the various frequency elements of eq. (22), we find\n\u0010\n\n2\n\u03c9\u00d7\n= k12 + O m2 t2\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n2\n2\n\u03c912\n\u03c911\n2\n2\n\u03c912 \u03c922\n\n!\n\n=\n\nk12 + O m2\u0001t2\nO m2 t2\n\n\u0001\n\nO m2 t2 \u0001\n2\nk1 + O m2 t2\n\u0001\n\n!\n\n(29)\n\nso that k1 always becomes dominant provided we go sufficiently early in time.12 Moreover, we see that\nthe modes H+ and V decouple also at asymptotically early times, so that we can set the initial conditions\ndirectly on them (rather than on the modes which would diagonalize the frequency matrix). Therefore, as\nlong as\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n2\n\u03c9\u00d7\n\u03c911\n\u03c922\n\u03c912\n\u03c912\n,\n,\n,\n,\n(30)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2 \u226a 1\n\u03c9\u00d7\n\u03c911\n\u03c922\n\u03c911\n\u03c922\nwe can consistently start from the adiabatic vacuum (27) for the perturbations. This always happens,\nprovided we go sufficiently early in time (the smaller k1 is, the earlier we have to go in time to satisfy these\nconditions).\nIn appendix C.1, we study whether other choices of time are possible to set the initial conditions. In\nthe isotropic case, the conformal time is related to the physical one by dt = a d\u03b7. The most obvious\ngeneralization is to consider some arbitrary power of the two scale factors in the definition of the conformal\ntime. We therefore discuss conformal times \u03c4 related to \u03b7 by\nd\u03b7 = a\u22122\u03b1 b\u22122\u03b2 d\u03c4\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two constant parameters. We show in appendix C.1 that this leads to an adiabatic\nevolving frequency only if \u03b1 = 0. Since b is constant at asymptotically early times, we conclude that\nthe time \u03b7 used here is the only possible one for the quantization, up to a trivial constant rescaling. In\nparticular, this rules out the most \"symmetric\" choice dt = a1/3 b2/3 d\u03c4 , where the scale factors along the\nthree coordinates are used with an equal weight.\nLet us now turn to the negative branch. In conformal time \u03b7, the frequency elements appearing in\neq. (22) are the same as for the positive branch (namely, eqs. (B.23) and (B.32)). However, the early time\n12\nThe only exception is when k1 is strictly zero, that is when the momentum of the mode lies in the y \u2212 z plane. This is a set\nof measure zero in the integral (7) for the correlators Cll\u2032 mm\u2032 , so we can disregard this exceptional case. Notice also that we\nused physical time to indicate the residual entries in the frequency element, while the evolution equations (22) are in conformal\ntime.\n\n12\n\n\fasymptotics are now different (due to the fact that we now take the negative solution for h in the asymptotic\neq.

Firstly, the frequencies are not\nadiabatically evolving at early times:\n4\n|\u03c9\u00d7 |\u2032\n\u2192\u221a\n2\n\u03c9\u00d7\n5\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c922\n\u03c911\n,\n2\n2 \u2192 \u22122\n\u03c911\n\u03c922\n\n,\n\n(33)\n\nFor this reason, we are not able to start from an adiabatic vacuum at early times, as we could do for the\npositive branch. Secondly, the 2d vector is tachyonic.\nAs we show in appendix C.2, it is not possible to find a conformal time in which the frequency of the\n2d scalars is initially adiabatically evolving. The situation is somewhat better for the 2d vector modes; by\n2 approaches a constant\nperforming a time redefinition of the form (31), with \u03b1 = 2 (1 + \u03b2), the frequency \u03c9\u00d7\nnegative value in the asymptotic past. In this case, we may choose to start from an adiabatic vacuum (using\n2 ). However, the fact that \u03c9 2 is negative makes the mode diverge. To see this, we\nthe absolute value of \u03c9\u00d7\n\u00d7\nnote that, for \u03b1 = 2 (1 + \u03b2), the transformation between the physical time t and the comoving time \u03c4 reads\ndt = a d\u03b7 = a\u22122\u03b1+1 b\u22122\u03b2 d\u03c4 = c t d\u03c4\n\n(34)\n\nwhere c is a positive constant. Integrating this relation, we see that the initial singularity (t = 0 in physical\n2 approaches a negative constant as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the 2d vector experiences\ntime) occurs at \u03c4 = \u2212\u221e. Since \u03c9\u00d7\na tachyonic growth which makes it diverge. More appropriately, we conclude that the 2d vector becomes\nnon-linear, and the perturbative computation breaks down. Modes with different scales and directions of\nmomenta are coupled at the nonlinear level; this will likely \"isotropize\" the effective Hubble drag felt by the\nnon-linear modes. Intuitively this would lead to a feedback resulting in the suppression of the their growth.\nNonetheless, the breakdown of the linearized computation (together with the lack of adiabaticity in the 2d\nscalar sector) prevents us from making trustable and firm predictions for the temperature anisotropies in the\nnegative branch, and for this reason we do not consider this branch further in the remainder of the analysis.\n\n4.3\n\nCurvature power spectrum\n\nWe want to compute the power spectrum for the (late time) scalar mode. According to the discussion of\nthe previous subsection, we restrict our attention to the positive branch. We proceed as follows. We fix\nan initial value for the inflaton (\u03c60 = 16 Mp in all the cases studied in this work, so to have about 60 efoldings of isotropic inflation), and we scan over several values for the two components k1,2 of the comoving\nmomentum of the mode. We choose a sufficiently early time such that the conditions (30) are satisfied, and\nwe set the initial conditions for the modes and their derivatives as given by the adiabatic solution (27). We\nthen numerically evolve the evolution equations (22) for the coupled {V, H+ } system, until a final time for\nwhich the background is isotropic (so that V \u2261 v, H+ \u2261 h+ ) and the modes of interest are well outside\nthe horizon. In figure 2 we show a contour plot with the value of k3 |v|2 at the end of inflation. This\nquantity is the curvature power\nq spectrum, up to an overall normalization factor. The horizontal axis in the\nfigure is the magnitude k = k12 + k22 of the comoving momentum, in units of a reference momentum kiso .\nThe latter is defined as the comoving momentum of the modes which exit the horizon when the universe\nbecomes isotropic; namely, kiso \u2261 aH at t = tiso , which we conventionally define to be the time at which\nh = 10\u22123 m. The vertical axis is instead the cosine of the angle between the comoving momentum and the\n13\n\n\f1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n\u039e\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nLog10 Hk\u0090kiso L\n\nFigure 2: Power spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbation R in the inflationary model V = m2 \u03c62 /2.\nThe inflaton field starts with \u03c6 = 16 Mp , and is evolved until the moment shown in the figure, when \u03c6 = Mp .\nModes with k > kiso leave horizon during the later isotropic stage of inflation. The standard result is\nrecovered for these modes.\nx\u2212axis (namely, k1 = k \u03be ). In figure 3 we show instead some sections of the power spectrum at fixed values\nof \u03be .\nModes with k \u226b kiso leave the horizon during the isotropic phase; at early times, their frequency changes\nadiabatically, and, as a consequence, they evolve according to the adiabatic solution (27). As the background\nbecomes isotropic, the frequency \u03c9 becomes the standard one, so that the mode adiabatically evolves to the\nadiabatic solution that one would have also found if the background had always been isotropic. For this\nreason, we expect to recover an isotropic power spectrum (no \u03be dependence) in this limit. This behaviour is\n< k ) are instead more sensitive to the background\nmanifest in the results shown. Larger scale modes (k \u223c\niso\nevolution in the anisotropic phase, and we expect nonstandard results in this regime. Indeed, at any fixed \u03be ,\n< k , and it then sharply decreases for k \u2192 0 .\nthe power spectrum exhibits an oscillatory behaviour for k \u223c\niso\nWe also observe that the power spectrum increases at low \u03be .

We\nsee that the power spectrum becomes isotropic (no \u03be dependence) at large momenta; at lower momenta\nit presents some oscillations, whose amplitude increases as \u03be decreases (this leads to the 1/\u03be divergency\nmentioned in the main text). Finally, the power spectrum is suppressed as k \u2192 0 .\nthe isotropic result for k \u2192 \u221e . Nonetheless, the growth of the power spectrum takes place at all values of\nk we have computed, provided \u03be is sufficiently small.\nAlthough we do not have an analytical solution of the system (22), the large power at small \u03be is most\n\u22121/2\nprobably due to the initial normalization |vin | \u221d k1\n\u221d \u03be \u22121/2 . In the isotropic case, modes with very small\n\u22121/2\nvalues of k start with a large amplitude |vin | \u221d k\n, but this does not lead to a large power spectrum\n3\n2\n3\nP \u221d k |v| , since the prefactor k is small in this regime. For the anisotropic case, the problem arises when\nk is finite, but \u03be \u2192 0 . In this regime, k1 \u226a k2 , so that the physical momentum is almost lying in the y \u2212 z\nplane in the later isotropic regime. However, the initial condition for the mode is set at sufficiently early\ntimes, for which k1 /ain \u226b k2 /bin . At the initial time, the mode has the large amplitude |vin | \u221d \u03be \u22121/2 , while\nthe prefactor k3 in the late time power spectrum k 3 |v|2 equals k23 , which is not suppressed in the \u03be \u2192 0\nlimit.\nThe divergency in the power spectrum results in a logarithmic divergency in the Cll\u2032 mm\u2032 correlators, due\nto the fact that the associated Legendre polynomials approach a finite constant value for \u03be \u2192 0 in the angular\nintegral of eq. (7), while the power spectrum diverges there. We do not expect that this singularity will\nactually occur, but it rather indicates the breakdown of the linearized computation for the metric/inflaton\nperturbations. This means that the precise value of the correlators is sensitive to the nonlinear dynamics of\nthe modes, which cannot be accounted for in the present linearized computation.\nIn addition to this, we note that the growth\n(35) occurs at small k1 . We recall that the early time\n\u0001\n2\n2\nfrequency of the modes is \u03c9 = k1 + O t , see eq. (19), and that the metric is singular at t = 0 . The\nadiabaticity condition, \u03c9 \u2032 /\u03c9 2 \u226a 1 is satisfied by all modes at sufficiently early times. However, the smaller\nk1 is, the closer one needs to go to the singularity for the adiabaticity condition to hold. Suppose that\nthe background solution can be trusted only from some time on. Then, we can consistently start from\nthe adiabatic vacuum only for modes with sufficiently high momentum k1 . The value of the modes with\n15\n\n\flower momentum may be simply provided as an (arbitrary) initial condition, or may be controlled by the\nadditional dynamics (possibly, by additional degrees of freedom), which may be relevant at earlier times.\nTo conclude, we expect that the singularity in the power spectrum is actually absent once the nonlinear\neffects and/or the complete early dynamics of the system are taken into account. In either case, however,\nthis means that additional inputs are needed to provide firm predictions for the temperature anisotropies\nin this simple model.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main result of this work is the extension of the computation of primordial perturbations in a FRW\ngeometry to more general backgrounds. We have done this in detail, only for the simplest case of a Bianchi\nI model with residual isotropy in two spatial directions, and with one scalar inflaton field: as in the isotropic\ncase, there are three physical modes. However, in contrast to this case, two of the modes are coupled to each\nother already at the linearized level, due to the fact that the background has less symmetries. At late times,\nwhen the background becomes isotropic, one of these two modes becomes the scalar perturbation, while\nthe other one becomes one of the two perturbations of the tensor mode. The key step in the computation\nis to completely fix the gauge for the perturbations without removing the \u03b4g0\u03bc entries. Such modes are\nnondynamical, and can be readily integrated out of the quadratic action of the perturbations. In this way,\none is left with only the physical degrees of freedom. It is straightforward to extend this computation to\na general Bianchi I model, without the residual 2d spatial isotropy. In this case, all the three modes will\nbe coupled to each other at the linearized level. Moreover, this procedure can be performed also for more\ngeneral backgrounds, or for cases in which more fields are present.\nSuch anisotropic backgrounds have a potentially very interesting phenomenology; for instance the early\ntime coupling between the scalar and tensor modes produces an off diagonal correlation between the CMB\nmodes (eq. 7), and, possibly a nonstandard tensor-to-scalar ratio. Moreover the two polarizations of the\ntensor modes behave differently at early times, and acquire different values. Therefore, a future detection\nof the tensor perturbations (for instance, through the B polarization modes) can provide extremely useful\ninformation to test this possibility.\nThe computation that we have outlined is a necessary first step for such studies, since it must be done\nin order to find the physical modes, and to fix their initial conditions. In standard isotropic inflation,\nthe frequency of the modes is controlled by their physical momentum p at early times, which is varying\nadiabatically due to the expansion of the universe, \u03c9 \u2032 /\u03c9 2 \u226a 1 . It is customary to start from the adiabatic\nvacuum (the immediate generalization of the de Sitter Bunch\u2013Davies [37] vacuum), which is a good solution\nof the equations of motion as long as the adiabaticity condition holds. 13 Due to this fact, the final result (a\nnearly scale invariant spectrum of the perturbations, in perfect agreement with observations) is insensitive\nto the \"initial time\" at which the initial vacuum is set, provided that the mode is deeply inside the horizon\n(p \u226b H) at this time.\nModels which go beyond the standard FRW geometry have additional parameters. To have some predictive power, one should hope that their phenomenology depends on as few inputs as possible. For instance, if\nwe find that also in this case the frequency of the physical perturbations varies adiabatically at early times,\nthen the problem of setting the initial vacuum is no worse than for standard inflation. We have seen that\nthis is not the case for the simple Bianchi I backgrounds that we have studied here. The main reason is that\nthe anisotropy parameter h (the difference of the two expansion rates) decreases very rapidly at the onset\nof inflation. Clearly, this geometry is continuously connected to FRW, and one can take h arbitrary small\nat the initial time. In this case, however, one recovers standard FRW inflation plus negligible corrections.\n13\n\nThe choice of the initial vacuum is however object of intense debate, see for instance [38], mostly due to the fact that the\nphysical momentum is trans-Planckian close to the initial singularity, and unknown UV physics may leave some imprint in the\nmode.\n\n16\n\n\fIf one hopes instead to find sizeable deviations from the isotropic case, the initial value\n\u221a of h must be large.\nIn this work we have studied the early evolution of the model starting from |h| \u226b V /Mp (where V is\nthe potential energy of the inflaton), assuming that the inflaton is in a slow roll regime also during the\nanisotropic phase. This leads to two distinct possibilities: in one case, two dimensions become static at\nasymptotically early times; in the other case, the anisotropic direction is initially contracting. In the second\ncase, the frequency of two of the modes is not adiabatically evolving at early times, while for the other one\nis actually tachyonic. In the first case, we do find an initial adiabatic regime; however, the amplitude of\nthe modes increases and eventually diverges as their momentum is more and more aligned towards the non\nexpanding directions.\nAs we have mentioned, this divergence is merely an indication of the breakdown of the linear approximation taken in our treatment. It is probable that nonlinear dynamics will stop the growth of the modes at\nthis stage. However, even if this is the case, the predictive power of the model is reduced greatly, since the\nmuch simpler linearized treatment is invalid. There may be other physical reasons why the run-off growth\nin the mode may not occur. A better behaving vacuum may result if all the directions are expanding at\nasymptotically early times. For a Bianchi I geometry, even dropping the assumption of residual 2d isotropy,\nthis cannot be achieved if the inflaton is initially in a slow roll regime (this can be understood from the\n00 Einstein equation; close to the initial singularity the three expansion rates cannot be all positive, if the\nenergy density of the inflaton remains finite). Alternatively, it is possible that the Bianchi I geometry is\nonly the final stage of the anisotropic phase, and that additional degrees of freedom are relevant at earlier\ntimes. Both these possibilities require additional input with respect to the minimal set-up studied here.\nOne may also study completely different anisotropic models from the start. For instance, it may be very\ninteresting to study models which evade Wald's theorem on the isotropization of Bianchi geometries [16].\nThis can happen if one modifies Einstein gravity, for instance through the Kalb\u2013Ramond action of string\ntheory [39], or through quadratic curvature invariants [40]. In such case, one can find attractor solutions\ncharacterized by anisotropic inflationary expansion. This may avoid the run-off growth problem found in\nthe model we have studied, since the difference h between the expansion rates decreases slower, or not at all,\nin these models, and therefore does not need to be extremely large in the asymptotic past. The challenge\nfor such models is to find solutions for which the anisotropy decays at late times, or, alternatively, can be\nkept at a very small but controllable level. This condition itself might lead to smaller, subdominant effects\nin the data which are yet to be observed.\nWe have taken a top-down approach in suggesting a model-oriented origin for the broken isotropy observed in the CMB. We have examined a particular form of anisotropy in the inflating universe but the\ntreatment presented here can be readily generalized to other forms of anisotropy. If the intriguing CMB\nanomalies are verified to be of cosmological origin through more accurate, future observations, including the\npolarization data, then they may well indicate a departure from the simplest picture of inflation. In that\ncase models such as the one presented here offer a minimal modification of the inflationary paradigm which\ncould predict the anomalous correlations required to explain the the data.\n\nNote added: While this work was being completed, we became aware of the work [41], which also\ndevelops a formalism for the computation of anisotropies in Bianchi I models. Although the approach is\nrather different, and a different conformal time is used in [41], we have verified that the evolution for the\ncanonical modes obtained in [41] agree with ours in the limit in which the background has a 2d residual\nisotropy. The work [41] does not study the background solutions for the model at the extent done here, and\nit therefore does not discuss the initial conditions for the perturbations, nor the resulting power spectrum\nand CMB temperature anisotropies. We also note that some of the results for the perturbations in the\nanisotropic model discussed here had also been summarized in [42].\n\n17\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe thank John D.

Since this is a linearized computation, we ignore the nonlinear coupling between different modes.\nWe can therefore fix a comoving momentum k, and study the evolutions of the modes having that momentum. The computation is exhaustive as long as we can solve the problem for any arbitrary value of k.\nDue to the residual symmetry in the y \u2212 z plane, we can fix kz = 0 without any loss of generality. More\nappropriately, we denote by k1 the component of the momentum along the anisotropic x direction, and by\nk2 the component in the orthogonal plane. We then choose the y \u2212 z coordinates such that the orthogonal\nmomentum lies on the y direction. In coordinate space, this amounts to considering modes which depend\non x and y only. 14 The most general perturbations of the metric can be then written as\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2212a2 (1 + 2 \u03a6) a \u22021 \u03c7\na \u22022 B\nb2 B 3\n\uf8ec\n2\n2\na (1 \u2212 2 \u03a8) b \u22021 \u22022 B\u0303\nb2 \u2202 B\u0303\n\uf8ec\n\u0001 2 1 3\n=\uf8ec\n2\n2\n\uf8ed\nb 1 \u2212 2 \u03a3 + 2 \u22022 E b \u22022 E3\nb2 (1 \u2212 2 \u03a3)\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n(B.9)\n\nIn addition, there is the perturbation of the inflaton field \u03c6 = \u03c6 + \u03b4\u03c6 .\nIn the isotropic computation, the modes are classified into tensor, vector, or scalar modes, according to\nhow they transform under 3d spatial rotations. This is particularly useful, since, due to the isotropy of the\nbackground, perturbations belonging to different groups are decoupled at the linearized level [31, 34]. A\n3d scalar has one degree of freedom. A 3d vector has one spatial index; however, due to the transversality\ncondition (\u2202i Vi = 0), it has two degrees of freedom. A 3d tensor has two spatial indices, and it is required to\nbe symmetric, transverse (\u2202i hij = 0), and traceless. Therefore, it also has 2 degrees of freedom. Altogether,\nthe 10 + 1 initial perturbations (of the metric and of the inflaton field), are classified into 5 scalar, 2 vector,\nand 1 tensor modes. 15\n14\n\nIn our computation we disregard the cases where the x and y dependence are trivial. Namely, we always assume that both\nk1 and k2 are different from zero. These two cases are of zero measure in the integral (7) and can therefore be disregarded.\n15\nWe stress that this is only the first step in the computation, which is dictated by mathematical convenience. Not all of these\nmodes are physical; altogether, 4 degrees of freedom are gauge modes, and 4 other ones are nondynamical. See the discussion\nin Subsection 4.1.\n\n19\n\n\fHere we do the same, but we classify the perturbations according to how they transform under 2d\nrotations (since modes will be decoupled only if they transform differently under 2d rotations in the y \u2212 z\nplane, due to the restricted isotropy of the background). A 2d scalar has one degree of freedom. A 2d vector\nhas 2 spatial indices, and is required to be transverse; therefore, it has one degree of freedom. Contrary\nto the previous case, 2d tensors instead do not exist, since there are no degrees of freedom left, once we\nimpose the mode to be symmetric, transverse, and traceless. Therefore, the 10 + 1 initial perturbations are\nclassified into 8 scalar and 3 vector modes.\nWe conclude this discussion with a note on our notation. A 2d vector in the y \u2212 z plane is in general\nindicated with Vi , where i = 2, 3. The transversality condition is then \u22022 V2 + \u22023 V3 = 0 . However, as\nmentioned before eq. (B.9), we can impose that the modes do not depend on the third coordinate, without\nany loss of generality. Therefore, we can set V2 = 0 , and the degree of freedom of the 2d vector is explicitly\nencoded into its component V3 . This justifies the choice of the 2d vector modes B3 , B\u03033 , E3 appearing in the\nmetric (B.9). The parameterization of the 2d scalars entering in (B.9) has been chosen for computational\nconvenience.\n\nB.1\n\nGauge choice\n\nWe can then proceed by either constructing gauge invariant perturbations, or by choosing a gauge which\ncompletely removes the gauge freedom (in the standard case, this is typically done by the choice of the\nlongitudinal gauge). The two procedure are completely equivalent, due to gauge invariance. We choose the\nsecond option, by setting\n\u03b4g12 = \u03b4g23 = \u03b4g22 = \u03b4g33 = 0\n(B.10)\nUnlike the more conventional gauge choices, we chose not to remove any perturbation entering in the g0\u03bc\nmetric elements. As we mentioned in Subsection 4.1, these modes are nondynamical [36]. Therefore, with\nthis gauge choice, we know from the start that the nondynamical modes of (B.9) are \u03a6, \u03c7, B, and B3 . This\nmodes will be then integrated out from the action of the perturbations (see below).\nIt is straightforward, although tedious, to show that this choice (i) can be made, and (ii) completely\nfixes the gauge freedom. This is true both for the isotropic (b = a) and anisotropic background. Under the\ngeneral coordinate transformation x\u03bc \u2192 x\u03bc + \u03be \u03bc , the metric transforms as\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n(0)\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1 \u03be \u03b1 \u2212\n\n(0)\n\ng\u03bc\u03b1 \u03be \u03b1,\u03bd \u2212\n\n(0)\n\ng\u03b1\u03bd \u03be \u03b1,\u03bc\n\n(B.11)\n\nWe parametrize \u03be \u03bc = \u03be 0 , \u22021 \u03be 1 , \u22022 \u03be, \u03be3 , so that \u03be3 is the 2d vector degree of freedom, while the other\nthree degrees of freedom are 2d scalars. Eq. (B.11) then explicitly gives\n\u0001\n\n\u2032\na\u2032 0\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be0 ,\na\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 + a \u03be0 \u2212 \u03be1 ,\n\n\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u2212\n\nB \u2192 B + a \u03be0 \u2212\n\nb2 \u2032\n\u03be ,\na\n\na\u2032 0\n\u03be + \u220212 \u03be 1 ,\na\na2\nB\u0303 \u2192 B\u0303 \u2212 2 \u03be 1 \u2212 \u03be ,\nb\nb\u2032 0\n\u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3+ \u03be ,\nb\nE \u2192 E \u2212\u03be,\n\u03a8 \u2192 \u03a8+\n\nB3 \u2192 B3 \u2212 b \u03be3\u2032 ,\n20\n\n\fB\u03033 \u2192 B\u03033 \u2212 \u03be3 ,\nE3 \u2192 E3 \u2212 \u03be3 .\n\n\u03b4\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 \u03be 0\n\n(B.12)\n\n(for completeness, in the last line we have indicated how the perturbation of the inflaton transforms). Our\ngauge choice corresponds to B\u0303 = \u03a3 = E = E3 = 0. It is easy to see that this is possible for one and only\none choice of the parameters \u03be \u03bc .\n\nB.2\n\nComparison with the standard modes in the isotropic limit (b = a)\n\nIt is instructive to see how the conventional modes (tensor and scalar modes of [34]) rewrite in this gauge,\nonce the background becomes isotropic. This will help us interpreting our results. To do so, we start from\nthe conventional mode parameterization, without 3d vectors (which are not supported during inflation) and\nwith the scalar modes written in the longitudinal gauge.

(C.45).\nTo summarize, we can consistently use the two different time variables \u03b7 and \u03c4 , provided the relation\namong them varies sufficiently slowly. If conditions (C.47) are met, and if the frequency \u03a9\u03b7 is adiabatically\nevolving, then also the frequency \u03a9\u03c4 is adiabatically evolving in its own time. These two procedures lead\nto equivalent initial conditions for the physical modes. On the other hand, we see that not all choices for\nconformal time are appropriate for the quantization.\nWe proceed by discussing what these findings imply for the Bianchi I backgrounds studied in the main\ntext. For sake of clarity, we study the positive and negative branches separately in the two following sections.\n\nC.1\n\nPositive branch\n\nWe show in Section 4.2 that, for the positive branch, one can quantize the perturbations in the conformal\ntime \u03b7 , defined in eq. (21). Here, we want to investigate whether some other time variable \u03c4 can be used.\nFor definiteness, let us restrict our attention to time redefinitions of the form\nd\u03b7 = f \u22122 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 = a\u22122 \u03b1 b\u22122\u03b2 d\u03c4\n\n(C.48)\n\nwhere a and b are the two scale factors, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 two constant parameters (this is the most immediate\ngeneralization of what is done in the isotropic case). Eqs. (C.47) give the three conditions that f needs to\nsatisfy for the two choices of time to provide the same initial conditions. We perform the computation using\nthe time \u03b7 , and we then present the early time expansion in physical time:\n1 df\nf d\u03b7\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n= |\u03b1| a (t) Ha (t) 1 + O m2 t2\n\n27\n\n\u0011i\n\n\u226a \u03a9\u03b7\n\n\f1 d2 f\nf d\u03b7 2\n\n= \u03b12 a2 (t) Ha2 (t) 1 + O m2 t2\n\n1 d3 f\nf d\u03b7 3\n\n= |\u03b13 | a3 (t) Ha3 (t) 1 + O m2 t2\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011i\n\n\u226a \u03a92\u03b7\n\n\u0011i\n\n\u226a \u03a93\u03b7\n(C.49)\n\u0001\n2\n\nNamely, these three conditions coincide. 17 From eq. (29) we have \u03a92\u03b7 = k12 +O m2 t for all the three modes,\nwhere k1 is the longitudinal (comoving) momentum of the mode in the anisotropic x\u2212direction. Therefore,\nwe must have |\u03b1|a (t) Ha (t) \u226a k1 at asymptotically early times. The product a Ha is nearly constant all\nthroughout the anisotropic sage, and very close to the value kiso defined in Section 4.3. Therefore, the three\nconditions (C.49) become\nk1 \u226b |\u03b1| kiso\n(C.50)\n\nThe modes with k1 \u226b kiso are those leaving the horizon after the universe has become isotropic, and\nwe recover the standard result for them (see Section 4.3). The modes with smaller longitudinal momentum\nare those sensitive to the evolution of the universe during the anisotropic stage, and therefore are those of\nreal interest for the present analysis. We can only quantize them using a time variable for which \u03b1 = 0\nin eq. (C.48). We remark that b is constant at asymptotically early times. Therefore, if we use the scale\nfactors in the definition of the conformal time, the time \u03b7 used in the main text is the only possible one, up\nto a trivial constant rescaling.\n\nC.2\n\nNegative branch\n\nLet us start from the early time frequencies for the modes canonically normalized with respect to conformal\ntime \u03b7. As shown in eq. (32) we find\n\u03a92\u03b7 = a2\n\n\"\n\n\u03a92\u03b7\n\n\"\n\n= a\n\n2\n\nk2\n5\n\u2212 2 + 22 + O (1)\n9t\nb\nk22\n4\n+\n+ O (1)\n9t2\nb2\n\n#\n\n#\n\n,\n,\n\n2 d vector\n2 d scalar\n\n(C.51)\n\nwhere, in the 2d scalar case, \u03a92\u03b7 refers to the dominant diagonal entries of the frequency matrix (which\nare identical). We recall that a \u221d t\u22121/3 , b \u221d t2/3 at asymptotically early times (as always, although the\nfrequency refers to the conformal time \u03b7, we show the expansion in terms of physical time t). As discussed\nin the main text, these frequencies are not adiabatically evolving at early times; moreover the 2d vector\nmode is tachyonic. Let us discuss whether the situation improves if we use a different time variable \u03c4 ; as\nfor the positive branch, we consider time redefinitions of the form (C.48).\nLet us discuss the 2d vector mode first. Evaluating the two equations (C.39) and (C.46) we find\n\u03a92\u03c4 =\n1 d\u03a9\u03c4\n\u03a92\u03c4 d\u03c4\n\n=\n\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011i\na\u22124\u03b1+2 b\u22124\u03b2\n2/3 2/3\n[(\u03b1\n\u2212\n2\u03b2\n+\n1)\n(\u03b1\n\u2212\n2\u03b2\n\u2212\n5)]\n1\n+\nO\nm\nt\n9 t2\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011i\n[\u03b1 \u2212 2 (1 + \u03b2)]\np\n1 + O m2/3 t2/3\n(\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b2 + 1) (\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u2212 5)\n\n(C.52)\n\nWe can obtain an adiabatic initial evolution of the frequency if we choose the parameters of the transformation such that \u03b1 = 2 (1 + \u03b2). However, in this case, the frequency \u03a9\u03c4 becomes\n\u03a92\u03c4 = \u2212\n17\n\n\u0010\n\u0011i\na\u22128\u03b2\u22126 b\u22124\u03b2 h\n2/3 2/3\n1\n+\nO\nm\nt\nt2\n\n(C.53)\n\nTo be rigorous, we showed that the three conditions (C.47) are sufficient to ensure that the two quantizations are equivalent,\nbut not necessary, since there may be cancellations in eq. (C.46); however, the specific form of (C.49) shows that these conditions\nare also necessary, once we restrict our attention to time redefinitions of the type (C.48).\n\n28\n\n\fBy using the early time asymptotics for the scale factors, we can see that the frequency (C.53) approaches\na constant negative value close to the initial singularity. This leads to a tachyonic growth of the mode, and\nto the breakdown of the linearized computation (see the main text).\nLet us finally discuss the 2d scalar sector. For generic values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 we now find\n\u03a92\u03c4 =\n1 d\u03a9\u03c4\n\u03a92\u03c4 d\u03c4\n\n=\n\no\na\u22124\u03b1+2 b\u22124\u03b2 n\n2\n2 2 2\n[\u03b1\n\u2212\n2\n(1\n+\n\u03b2)]\n+\n9\nt\nk\n/b\n+ O (1)\n2\n9 t2\n\u0001\n2 [\u03b1 \u2212 2 (1 + \u03b2)]3 + 9 t2 (\u22123 + 2\u03b1 \u2212 4\u03b2) k22 /b2 + O t2\ni3/2\n\nh\n\n[\u03b1 \u2212 2 (1 + \u03b2)]2 + 9 t2 k22 /b2 + O (t2 )\n\n(C.54)\n\nFor \u03b1 6= 2 (1 + \u03b2), the second expression evaluates to 2 at asymptotically early time. For \u03b1 = 2 (1 + \u03b2),\nthe dominant term vanishes both at the numerator and at the denominator, and the adiabaticity condition\napproaches 1/ (3 t p2 ). This quantity diverges as t\u22121/3 as the time approaches the initial singularity at t = 0 .\nTherefore, no time variable \u03c4 chosen as in (C.48) leads to an initial adiabatic evolution for the 2d scalars.\n\nReferences\n[1] Spergel, D.
