Because of their decay-properties, they are considered\nto be non-cc\u0304 states, and there are some possible explanations for the origin\nof these states: D 0 D\u0304 \u22170 molecule state[3] and four-quark cn-n\u0304c\u0304 state[4]. In this\nletter, we consider the four-quark explanation of X(3872)/Y (3940), where\nthe relevant particles are considered as the cn di-quark and n\u0304c\u0304 di-antiquark\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n9 November 2018\n\n\fsystem. This explanation is criticized from the observed decay widths. The cnn\u0304c\u0304 system decays to D D\u0304 (\u2217) and J/\u03c8\u03c1(or J/\u03c8\u03c9). They are so-called OZI superallowed processes, and proceed without no q q\u0304-pair production or annihilation.\nTheir widths are expected to be so large as a few hundred MeV or more. On\nthe other hand the observed widths of X(3872) and Y (3940) are very small,\n\u0393X < 2.3MeV[1] 1 and \u0393Y = 87 \u00b1 22 \u00b1 26MeV[2], respectively.\nA few years ago[5], we have proposed a covariant level-classification scheme\nof hadrons based on \u0168(12) spin-flavor group. It is a relativistic generalization of the SU(6)SF -scheme in non-relativistic quark model(NRQM), and the\nsquared-mass spectra of hadrons including light constituent quarks are classified as the representations of \u0168 (12). (Concerning the \u0168 (12)-scheme and its\ngroup theoretical arguments, see our ref.[6].) The essential difference from\nSU(6)SF is a spinor WF. Each spinor index corresponding to light constituent\nquark in composite hadron WF is expanded by free Dirac spinors ur,s (v\u03bc )\ncalled urciton spinors. At the rest frame u+,s(0) has the upper two-component\nwhich corresponds to the Pauli spinor appearing in NRQM, while the u\u2212,s (0)\nhas the lower two-component representing the relativistic effect. The r index of ur,s represents the eigen-value of \u03c13 , and the corresponding freedom is\ncalled \u03c1-spin, while the ordinary Pauli-spin freedom is called \u03c3-spin. In the\n\u0168 (12)-scheme, the u\u2212,s is supposed to appear as new degrees of freedom for\nlight constituents, being independent of u+,s, and we predict the existence\nof a number of extra states out of the SU(6)SF -framework for meson and\nbaryon systems. These extra states are called chiral states, since u\u2212,s is obtained from u+,s through chiral \u03b35 transformation. The \u0168(12) representation is\nconsidered to be actually realized in light-quark baryon spectra. The groundstate qqq baryons, N-octet and \u2206-decouplet, have positive-parity. Experimentally, the next low-lying states, N(1440), \u039b(1600), \u2206(1600), * * *, have also\npositive-parity, contrarily to the expectation of NRQM. In \u0168(12)-scheme this\nparity-doubling problem is resolved in its representation. The qqq-baryons and\nantibaryons in ground states form 364, which includes two 56 baryons with\npositive-parity in terms of SU(6)SF . The extra 56 has \u03c13 WF, (+, \u2212, \u2212). The\nmasses and strong decay widths of positive-parity baryons, N(1440), \u039b(1600)\nand \u03a3(1660), are consistent with this extra 56[7], while the ordinary radially\nexcited states have large widths of several hundred MeV and are expected not\nto be observed as resonant particles.\nThe heavy-light Qq\u0304 mesons in ground states are classified as 12\u2217 , which includes the chiral J P = 0+ /1+ states with positive-parity as well as the ordinary 0\u2212 /1\u2212 states. They form linear representations of chiral symmetry[6,8].\nq\u0304\nThe chiral states have (\u03c1Q\n3 , \u03c13 ) = (+, \u2212), and they are expected to appear\nin smaller mass region as different states from the P -wave states. The masses\n1\n\nThe other (and main) reason of this tiny \u0393X is explained from its small phase\nspace of the decays to D 0 D\u0304 \u22170 and J/\u03c8 \u03c1(\u2192 \u03c0\u03c0).\n\n2\n\n\f(\u03c1c3 , \u03c1n3 )\n\nJP\n\n\u0393Pcn (Pauli state)\n\n(\u03c1c3 , \u03c1n3 )\n\nJP\n\n\u0393\u03c7cn (chiral state)\n\n(+, +)\n\n0+\n\n\u221a5 C \u2020\n(1 \u2212 iv * \u03b3) 2\u2212\u03b3\n2\n\n0\u2212\n\n1\nC\u2020\n(1 \u2212 iv * \u03b3) 2\u221a\n2\n\n(+, +)\n\n1+\n\n\u221a C\u2020\n(1 \u2212 iv * \u03b3) 2i\u01eb*\u03b3\n2\n\n(+, \u2212)\n(+, \u2212)\n\n1\u2212\n\nC\u2020\n(1 \u2212 iv * \u03b3) i\u03b325\u221a\u01eb*\u03b3\n2\n\n(\u03c1n\u03043 , \u03c1c\u03043 )\n\nJP\n\n\u0393Pn\u0304c\u0304 (Pauli state)\n\n(\u03c1n\u03043 , \u03c1c\u03043 )\n\nJP\n\n\u0393\u03c7n\u0304c\u0304 (chiral state)\n\n(+, +)\n\n0+\n\n\u221a5 (1 + iv * \u03b3)\nC \u2020 2\u2212\u03b3\n2\n\n(\u2212, +)\n\n0\u2212\n\n\u221a (1 + iv * \u03b3)\nC \u2020 2\u22121\n2\n\n\u221a (1 + iv * \u03b3)\n(+, +) 1+ C \u2020 2i\u01eb*\u03b3\n(1 + iv * \u03b3)\n(\u2212, +) 1\u2212 C \u2020 i\u03b325\u221a\u01eb*\u03b3\n2\n2\nTable 1\nDi-quark and Di-antiquark spinor WF \u0393cn and \u0393n\u0304c\u0304 in \u0168 (12)-scheme. The \u03c13 WF\nare also shown. The charge conjugation matrix C \u2020 = \u03b32 \u03b34 .\n\nand decay properties of Ds (2317)/Ds (2460) are naturally explained as the chiral states in cs\u0304 system, where s\u0304 has negative \u03c13 quantum number. Applying\nthe \u0168(12)-scheme, the heavy-light Qq di-quark (light-heavy q\u0304 Q\u0304 di-antiquark)\nforms 12(12\u2217 ) in ground states, which includes chiral J P = 0\u2212 /1\u2212 states with\nnegative parity as well as the ordinary 0+ /1+ states. The chiral Qq(q\u0304 Q\u0304) states\nhave negative \u03c1q3 (\u03c1q\u03043 ), and they are out of the non-relativistic framework.\nWe have pointed out in our previous work[7,9] a kind of phenomenological\nconservation rule applicable to chiral states, called \u03c13 -line rule. In transitions\nof chiral states, the \u03c13 quantum number along each spectator-quark line is approximately conserved. The violation of \u03c13 is suppressed by the factor P/2M,\nwhere P(M) is the final hadron momentum(mass), (not by P/2mq , where mq\nis the constituent quark mass).\nThere is an interesting possibility that the observed X(3872) and Y (3940)\nare chiral states, which are made from negative-parity cn di-quark and n\u0304c\u0304 diantiquark, and that their narrow-width properties are explained by the \u03c13 -line\nrule, since the relevant decays are quark-rearrangement processes and proceed\nonly through the spectator-quark interaction. The purpose of this letter is\nto investigate the masses and properties of strong decays of ground cn-n\u0304c\u0304\nstates in \u0168(12)-scheme, and to consider whether the X(3872) and Y (3940)\nare explained as chiral cn-n\u0304c\u0304 states or not.\n\n2\n\nDi-quark and Di-antiquark Spinor Wave Function\n\nAs was explained in the previous section, in \u0168 (12)-scheme the negative-parity\ncn di-quark(n\u0304c\u0304 di-antiquark), called chiral state, appears in ground-state.\nThey are denoted as \u0393\u03c7cn (\u0393\u03c7n\u0304c\u0304 ), which has negative \u03c1n3 (\u03c1n\u03043 ), while the ordinary positive-parity di-quark(di-antiquark), called Pauli state, is denoted as\n\u0393Pcn (\u0393Pn\u0304c\u0304 ), which is composed of constituents both with positive \u03c13 . Their explicit forms are given in Table 1.\n3\n\n\fAs is seen from Table 1, aside from C \u2020 , the \u0393cn is the same as the WF of\ncn\u0304-meson Hcn\u0304 in heavy quark effective theory. That is, \u0393cn = Hcn\u0304 C \u2020 . The\n0+ /1+ di-quark WF correspond to 0\u2212 /1\u2212 meson WF, and the 0\u2212 /1\u2212 chiral\ndi-quark WF correspond to the 0+ /1+ chiral meson WF. The chiral 0+ /1+\nmesons become heavier[6,8] than the 0\u2212 /1\u2212 states through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking(\u03c7SB), which \u221a\nis described by the Yukawa coupling to\ni i\nthe scalar \u03c3-meson nonet s = s \u03bb / 2 in the framework of SU(3) linear \u03c3\nmodel[10]. In Qq di-quark systems, because of the C \u2020 factor, the chiral 0\u2212 /1\u2212\nstates are expected to have smaller masses than the 0+ /1+ Pauli states. The\nmass shift \u03b4M \u03c7,P in \u03c7SB is given by\n\n\u03c7,P\n\u03c7,P\n\u03c7,P \u2020 \u2020 \u03c7,P\n\u03c7,P\n\u03b4M \u03c7,P = g\u03c3 s0 h\u0393\u03c7,P\ncn \u0393cn i = g\u03c3 s0 hHcn\u0304 C C Hcn\u0304 i = \u2212g\u03c3 s0 hHcn\u0304 Hcn\u0304 i,\n\n\u03c7,P \u2020\n\u2020 2\nwhere \u0393\u03c7,P\ncn \u2261 \u03b34 (\u0393cn ) \u03b34 , and the change of sign comes from (C ) = \u22121. The\ns0 is vacuum expectation value of s and g\u03c3 is the Yukawa coupling constant.\nThe chiral mass splitting \u2206M\u03c7 (\u2261 \u03b4M P \u2212 \u03b4M \u03c7 ) = 2g\u03c3 s0 is predicted with\n242MeV in our previous work[6], which is estimated by using the masses of\nDs (2317) and Ds (2460) as inputs.\n\nConcering cn-n\u0304c\u0304 system, we expect three combinations of \u0393cn -\u0393n\u0304c\u0304 : The \u0393Pcn \u03c7\n\u0393Pn\u0304c\u0304 denoted as Pauli-Pauli states, the \u0393Pcn -\u0393n\u0304c\u0304\n(or \u0393\u03c7cn -\u0393Pn\u0304c\u0304 ) denoted as Pauli\u03c7\n\u03c7\nchiral(or chiral-Pauli) states, and the \u0393cn -\u0393n\u0304c\u0304 denoted as chiral-chiral states.\nAmong them the chiral-chiral states have the smallest masses, the chiral-Pauli\nstates are heavier by \u2206M\u03c7 , and the Pauli-Pauli states are further heavier by\n\u2206M\u03c7 . For the transitions between chiral and Pauli states, the amplitudes of\npion emission are expected to be very large, since the pseudoscalar NambuGoldstone bosons have the spinor WF i\u03b35 /2, which changes \u03c13 quantum number of the interacting quark. The Pauli-Pauli states decay to Pauli-chiral states\nthrough pion emission, and the Pauli-chiral states do to chiral-chiral states.\nThese decays are S-wave, and the widths are expected to be so large as several\nhundred MeV or a GeV. Accordingly, the Pauli-Pauli states and Pauli-chiral\nstates are not observed as resonances, but as non-resonant backgrounds.\nThis is quite similar mechanism to the situation in 70G baryons in \u0168 (12)scheme. They are not observed as resonances because of their large widths of \u03c0\n(or K) decays to 56E baryons, except for \u039b(1405)[7]. We focus our interests on\nchiral-chiral states in the following. Their masses are predicted by considering\nspin-spin interaction in the next section.\n4\n\n(1)\n\n\f(\n\nx)\n\ns\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1\n\nr\n\ns\nn( 2)\n\nR\n\ns\n\nX\n1\n\ns\nr\n\n\u0016(\n4\n\n4\n\ns\n\n2\n\ns\n\n2\n\nx)\n\n3\n\nx\n\nn\n\u0016 ( 3)\n\nU\n\nFig. 1.

The space\nWF of cn-n\u0304c\u0304 system are required for this purpose, and we use the joint\nspring quark model(JSQM)[11], where the cn di-quark (n\u0304c\u0304 di-antiquark) is\nin color 3\u2217 (3), and they are connected by spring potential as shown in Fig. 1.\nCorrespondingly, the Lagrangian of the four quark system is given by\n\nL=\n\nmc 2\nmn 2\nk\nk\n(\u1e8b1 + \u1e8b24 ) +\n(\u1e8b2 + \u1e8b23 ) \u2212 (s21 + s22 + s23 + s24 ) \u2212 (r1 \u2212 r2 )2 , (2)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhere x1,2 = X + r1 + s1,2 and x3,4 = X + r2 + s3,4 . The definition of each\nspace coordinate is given in Fig. 1. The mc (mn ) are constituent quark mass of\nc(n) and k is the spring constant. The analytic formulas for eigen-modes are\nsomewhat complicated, so we show only numerical results.\n\u221a\ns = (x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 x3 + x4 )/ 2, R = 0.785(x1 \u2212 x4 ) + 0.083(x2 \u2212 x3 ),\nU = 0.365(x1 \u2212 x4 ) \u2212 0.862(x2 \u2212 x3 ),\n(3)\nwhere we take mc = MJ/\u03c8 /2 = 1.548GeV and mn = m\u03c1 /2 = 0.385GeV. The\nk\n\u221a is determined from2 the inverse Regge 3 slope of nn\u0304 meson system, \u03a9nn\u0304 =\n32mn k = 1.14GeV , as k = 0.107GeV [12]. We may regard s as the relative coordinate in di-quark or di-antiquark, R(U) approximately as relative\ncoordinate between c and c\u0304(n and n\u0304).

Now we can predict the strengths of spin-spin interactions in all\npossible pairs of constituents. The results are given in Table 2. By using Table\n2, we can determine the mass-shifts \u2206MSS in ground-states of cn-n\u0304c\u0304 system.\nThe J P C of X(3872) is plausibly 1++ [13], which is obtained by the combi\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n1\u2212\nnations \u03930cn -\u0393n\u0304c\u0304\nand \u03931cn -\u03930n\u0304c\u0304 . The X(3872) is used as input to fix overall\nmass-shift, and the masses of all the other states are predicted in Table 3. The\n\u2212\n\u2212\nmass of 2++ state, made from \u03931cn -\u03931n\u0304c\u0304 , is predicted with 3932MeV, which is\nvery close to the experimental value of Y (3940), M = 3943 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 13MeV[2].\nThis 2++ is a candidate of Y (3940). At the same time, as well as X(3872) and\nY (3940), we predict the existence of the other 4 states with J P C = 0++ and\n1+\u2212 in the same mass region. However, these extra 4 states are expected to\nbe not observed as narrow-width resonances but as backgrounds, as will be\ndiscussed in the next section.\n\n4\n\nStrong Decays\n\n(Overlapping of spinor WF) The decay mechanism of the relevant quarkrearrangement processes is unknown, however, it may be reasonable to assume\nthat the decay matrix elements are proportional to the overlappings of the\n6\n\n\fJPC\n\n\u2206MSS\n\nMass\n\n0++\n\n-65\n\n3824\n\n(J/\u03c8\u03c1),\n\n\u03b7c \u03c0,\n\n+ \u03931cn -\u03930n\u0304c\u0304 )\n\n1+\u2212\n\n-27\n\n3862\n\nJ/\u03c8\u03c0,\n\n\u03b7c \u03c1\n\n\u2212 \u03931cn -\u03930n\u0304c\u0304 )\n\n1++\n\n-17\n\n3872\n\nJ/\u03c8\u03c1\n\n0++\n\n-22\n\n3867\n\n(J/\u03c8\u03c1),\n\n\u03b7c \u03c0,\n\nD D\u0304\n\n1+\u2212\n\n0.\n\n3889\n\nJ/\u03c8\u03c0,\n\n\u03b7c \u03c1,\n\nD D\u0304 \u2217 (D-wave)\n\ntype\n\u03930cn -\u03930n\u0304c\u0304\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u221a1 (\u03930 -\u03931\ncn\nn\u0304c\u0304\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u221a1 (\u03930 -\u03931\nn\u0304c\u0304\ncn\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03931cn -\u03931n\u0304c\u0304\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0393cn -\u0393n\u0304c\u0304\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\ndecay channels\nD D\u0304\n\nD 0 D\u0304 \u22170\n\n\u03931cn -\u03931n\u0304c\u0304\n2++\n+43\n3932\nJ/\u03c8\u03c1,\nD D\u0304 (\u2217) (D-wave)\nTable 3\nMasses of ground-state cn-n\u0304c\u0304 system (in MeV). The mass of X(3872) is used as\ninput. The \u2206MSS are mass-shifts from spin-spin interaction. Possible decay channels\nof I=1 states are also shown. For I=0 states, \u03c1(\u03c0) is replaced with \u03c9(\u03b7). The\nbrackets of (J/\u03c8\u03c1) for two 0++ states, of which masses are smaller than M\u03c8 + m\u03c1 ,\nmean that this channel is possible as J/\u03c8\u03c0\u03c0 through the wide width of \u03c1-meson. The\n\u0393n\u0304c\u0304 are related with \u0393cn by the charge conjugation transformation, \u0393cn \u2192 C \u2020 t \u0393cn C.\n+ +\n+ +\n\u2212 \u2212\n0\u2212 ,1\u2212\nThe C \u2020 t \u03930cn ,1 C = \u2213\u03930n\u0304c\u0304 ,1 , while the C \u2020 t \u03930cn ,1 C = \u00b1\u0393n\u0304c\u0304\n. These relations are\nused to define the charge conjugation parity of total cn-n\u0304c\u0304 system.\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\ninitial and final WFs. The overlapping of spinor WFs, denoted as As , are\ngiven for the decays to cn\u0304 + nc\u0304 and cc\u0304 + nn\u0304, respectively, by\nAs (cn\u0304 + nc\u0304) = h\u0393\u03c7n\u0304c\u0304 H D\u0304 (vD\u0304 )(\u2212ivD\u0304 * \u03b3) t \u0393\u03c7cn t [ivD * \u03b3H D (vD )]i\n= h\u0393\u03c7n\u0304c\u0304 B(vD\u0304 )H D\u0304 B\u0304(vD\u0304 ) t \u0393\u03c7cn t [B(vD )H D B\u0304(vD )]i\nAs (cc\u0304 + nn\u0304) = h\u0393\u03c7n\u0304c\u0304 H \u03c8 (v\u03c8 )\u0393\u03c7cn t [iv\u03c1 * \u03b3H \u03c1 (v\u03c1 )(\u2212iv\u03c1 * \u03b3)]i\n= h\u0393\u03c7n\u0304c\u0304 B(v\u03c8 )H \u03c8 B\u0304(v\u03c8 ) \u0393\u03c7cn t [B(v\u03c1 )H \u03c1 B\u0304(v\u03c1 )]i,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere D D\u0304 and J/\u03c8\u03c1 are taken as examples of cn\u0304 + nc\u0304 and cc\u0304 + nn\u0304. The H(v)\nis the spinor WF of the final meson with velocity v\u03bc (\u2261 P\u03bc /M), and H is\nthe one at the rest frame with velocity v0\u03bc = (0, 0, 0; i). They are related by\nLorentz boosterqB(v), B\u0304(v) = ch\u03b8 \u00b1 \u03c11 n * \u03c3sh\u03b8 as H(v) = B(v)H B\u0304(v), where\nthe ch\u03b8, sh\u03b8 = E\u00b1M\n. In Eq. (6), the change of \u03c13 on each quark-line in the\n2M\ndecay occurs only through \u03c11 term in B(v) and B\u0304(v), which is proportional to\nP\n,\nsh\u03b8. It is related with the momentum P of the final meson as ch\u03b8sh\u03b8 = 2M\nwhich is much smaller than unity for the relevant decays because of their small\nphase space. Thus, the \u03c13 quantum number along every the spectator-quark\nline is approximately conserved[7].\nIn the chiral-chiral states, the n in cn di-quark and the n\u0304 in n\u0304c\u0304 di-antiquark\nare in negative \u03c13 state. Thus, their decay amplitudes to the Pauli mesons, of\nwhich \u03c13 of constituents are all positive, are doubly suppressed with the factor\nP 2\n( 2M\n) . In \u0168 (12)-scheme, the WF of vector mesons[14], J/\u03c8, \u03c1, \u03c9, D \u2217 and D\u0304 \u2217 ,\n\u221a , where the \u03c13 of constituents\nare commonly given by H = (1 + iv0 * \u03b3) 2i\u01eb*\u03b3\n2\nq\nq\u0304\nare all positive, (\u03c13 , \u03c13 ) = (+, +). On the other hand, the WF of pseudoscalar\n7\n\n\fmesons, \u03c0 and \u03b7, which are Nambu-Goldstone bosons, are H = i\u03b325 , which has\ndoubly-negative \u03c13 component as (\u03c1q3 , \u03c1q\u03043 ) = \u221a12 ( (+, +) + (\u2212, \u2212) )(, while the\nWF of D and \u03b7c is H = (1 + iv0 * \u03b3) 2\u03b3\u221a52 , which has (\u03c1c3 , \u03c1c\u03043 ) = (+, +)). Thus,\nin the relevant decays of the chiral-chiral states, the transition amplitudes to\nJ/\u03c8\u03c1(\u03c9), \u03b7c \u03c1(\u03c9) and D D\u0304 (\u2217) are strongly suppressed from \u03c13 -line rule, while\nthe ones to J/\u03c8\u03c0(\u03b7) and \u03b7c \u03c0(\u03b7) are not suppressed. The decay widths of the\nlatter channels are expected to be a few hundred MeV or a GeV.\nThus, when the initial states have no \u03c0(\u03b7) decay modes, they have narrow\nwidths, and are expected to be observed as resonant particles. The possible\ndecay channels of the ground six states are shown in Table 3. Among them,\nonly two states with J P C = 1++ and 2++ have no \u03c0(\u03b7) decay modes and are\nconsidered to be detected as resonances. Concerning these two states the decays\nto \u03b7c \u03c0(\u03b7) are also forbidden from the conservation of heavy quark spin[15]. This\ntheoretical expectation is consistent with the present experimetnal situation:\nOnly two states, X(3872) and Y (3940), are observed as the exotic candidates\nin the relevant mass region.\n(Decay widths) We can also calculate the overlappings of space WFs, denoted\nas F\u0303x . They are given by\n\nF\u0303x (cn\u0304 + nc\u0304) =\nF\u0303x (cc\u0304 + nn\u0304) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd3 p1 d3 p2 fD (qD )fD\u0304 (qD\u0304 ) * fs (ps )fR (pR )fU (pU ),\nd3 p1 d3 p2 f\u03c8 (q\u03c8 )f\u03c1 (q\u03c1 ) * fs (ps )fR (pR )fU (pU ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the ps etc. are internal momenta, the fs (ps )'s are WFs in momentum\n1\n2\n3\nrepresentation, fs (ps ) = ( \u03c0\u03b21 s ) 4 e\u2212 2\u03b2s ps . Their numerical values are F\u0303x (cn\u0304 +\n3\n\n3\n\nnc\u0304) = 0.96GeV\u2212 2 and F\u0303x (cc\u0304 + nn\u0304) = 1.05GeV\u2212 2 , respectively. We neglect the\n3\ndifference between them, and use a common value F\u0303x \u2243 1GeV\u2212 2 .\nThe width \u0393 of the decay X(or Y )\u2192 A + B is given by\n\u0393 = a|P|(EA EB M F\u0303x2 )|As |2\n\n(8)\n\nwith one dimension-less parameter a, where M is the mass of initial 4 quark\nstate, and EA (EB ) is the energy of the final meson A(B). The |P| is the\nmomentum of final meson. The explicit forms of As and |As |2 , and the corresponding decay widths for the relevant decay modes of X(3872) and Y (3940)\nare given in Table 4. The parameter a is fixed with a = 18.8, which is determined by the the total width of Y (3940), \u0393Y = 87MeV, as input.

The parameter a(see, Eq. (8)) is fixed\nwith a = 18.8 through \u0393tot\nY =87MeV as input. The overlappings of spinor WF,\nAs , and their spin-averaged squares |As |2 are also given.

Their narrow widths are explained from a phenomenological selection rule, coming from an orthogonality of spinor WFs,\ncalled \u03c13 -line rule. Only these two states are expected to be observed as resonant particles in ground states, and the other states have very large widths\nand are not observed as resonances but as non-resonant backgrounds.\nIn order to check this interpretation, we present the predictions for the properties of ground cs-s\u0304c\u0304 states in Table 5. Their masses are estimated simply by\nadding 2(MDs\u2217 \u2212 MD\u22170 ) \u2243 210MeV to the corresponding cn-n\u0304c\u0304 states.

The J P C = 1++ and 2++ states, de1++ and Y 2++ , are expected to be observed. Their masses\nnoted, respectively, as Xcs\u2212s\u0304c\u0304\ncs\u2212s\u0304c\u0304\n2++ are given. Its total width is simply estimated\nand the partial decay widths of Ycs\u2212s\u0304c\u0304\nby the sum as \u0393tot2++ =23+8+11=42MeV.\nYcs\u2212s\u0304c\u0304\n\ndecay widths are estimated by using Eq. (8) with the common parameter a.\n1++\nThe mass of Xcs\u2212s\u0304c\u0304\nis expected to be quite close to the Ds D\u0304s\u2217 threshold and its\ndecay is strongly suppressed. The J/\u03c8\u03c6 is un-open channel. Thus, the main\ndecay mode is considered to be electromagnetic ones of order keV. The main\n2++\ndecay mode of Ycss\u0304c\u0304\nis Ds D\u0304s . In order to check the four quark nature of this\nstate, it is necessary to observe J/\u03c8\u03c6 decay.\nThe authors would like to express their sincere gratitudes to the members of\n\u03c3-group for useful comments and encouragements.
