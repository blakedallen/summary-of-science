P.J.Cameron introduced the orbit algebra of a permutation group and\nconjectured that this algebra is an integral domain if and only if the group has no\nfinite orbit. We prove that this conjecture holds and in fact that the age algebra of a\nrelational structure R is an integral domain if and only if R is age-inexhaustible. We\ndeduce these results from a combinatorial lemma asserting that if a product of two\nnon-zero elements of a set algebra is zero then there is a finite common tranversal of\ntheir supports. The proof is built on Ramsey theorem and the integrity of a shuffle\nalgebra.\n\nIntroduction\nIn 1981, P.J.Cameron [4] (see also [9] p.86) associated a graded algebra A[G] to a\npermutation group G acting on an infinite set E. He formulated two conjectures on\nthe integrity of this algebra. The purpose of this paper is to present a solution to the\nfirst of these conjectures. Consequences on the enumeration of finite substructures of\na given structure are mentionned. Some problems are stated.\n0.1. The conjectures. Here is the content of these conjectures, freely adapted from\nCameron's web page (see Problem 2 [10]). The graded algebra A[G] is the direct sum\nX\nA[G]n\nn<\u03c9\n\nwhere A[G]n is the set of all G-invariant functions f from the set [E]n of n-element\nsubsets of E into the field C of complex numbers. Multiplication is defined by the\nrule that if f \u2208 A[G]m , g \u2208 A[G]n and Q is an (m + n)-element subset of E then\nX\n(1)\n(f g)(Q) :=\nf (P )g(Q \\ P )\nP \u2208[Q]m\n\nAs shown by Cameron, the constant function e in A[G]1 (with value 1 on every one\nelement set) is not a zero-divisor (see Theorem 0.8 below). The group G is entire if\nA[G] is an integral domain, and strongly entire if A[G]/eA[G] is an integral domain.\nDate: November 6, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 03 C13, 03 C52, 05 A16, 05 C30, 20 B27.\nKey words and phrases.

G is (strongly) entire if and only if it has no finite orbit on E.\nThe condition that G has no finite orbit on E is necessary. We prove that it suffices\nfor G to be entire. As it turns out, our proof extends to the algebra of an age, also\ninvented by Cameron [10].\n0.2. The algebra of an age. A relational structure is a realization of a language\nwhose non-logical symbols are predicates. This is a pair R := (E, (\u03c1i )i\u2208I ) made of a\nset E and a family of mi -ary relations \u03c1i on E. The set E is the domain or base of\nR; the family \u03bc := (mi )i\u2208I is the signature of R. The substructure induced by R on\na subset A of E, simply called the restriction of R to A, is the relational structure\nR\u21beA := (A, (Ami \u2229 \u03c1i )i\u2208I ). Notions of isomorphism, as well as isomorphic type, are\ndefined in natural way (see Subsection 1.1).\nA map f : [E]m \u2192 C, where m is a non negative integer, is R-invariant if f (P ) =\nf (P \u2032) whenever the restrictions R|P and R|P \u2032 are isomorphic. The R-invariant maps\ncan be multiplied. Indeed, it is not difficult to show that if f : [E]m \u2192 C and\ng : [E]n \u2192 C are R-invariant, the product defined by Equation (1) is R-invariant.\nEquipped with this multiplication, the C-vector space spanned by the R-invariant\nmaps becomes a graded algebra, the age algebra of R, that we denote by C.A(R).\nThe name, coined by Cameron, comes from the notion of age defined by Fra\u0131\u0308ss\u00e9 [13].\nIndeed, the age of R is the collection A(R) of substructures of R induced on the\nfinite subsets of R, isomorphic substructures being identified. And it can be shown\nthat two relational structures with the same age yields the same algebra (up to an\nisomorphism of graded algebras).\nThe algebra associated to a group is a special case of age algebra. Indeed, to a\npermutation group G acting on E we may associate a relational structure R with\nbase E such that the G-invariant maps coincide with the R-invariant maps.\nOur criterium for the integrity of the age algebra is based on the notion of kernel:\nThe kernel of a relational structure R is the subset K(R) of x \u2208 E such that\nA(R|E\\{x} ) 6= A(R).\nThe emptyness of the kernel R is a necessary condition for the integrity of the\nage algebra. Indeed, if K(R) 6= \u2205, pick x \u2208 K(R) and F \u2208 [E]<\u03c9 such that R\u21beF \u2208\nA(R) \\ A(R|E\\{x}). Let P \u2208 [E]<\u03c9 . Set f (P ) := 1 if R\u21beP is isomorphic to R\u21beF ,\notherwise set f (P ) := 0. Then f 2 := f f = 0.\nTheorem 0.2. Let R be a relational structure with possibly infinitely many non isomorphic types of n-element substructures. The age algebra C.A(R) is an integral\ndomain if and only if the kernel of R is empty.\nThe application to the conjecture of Cameron is immediate. Let G be a permutation\ngroup acting on E and let R be a relational structure encoding G. Then, the kernel\nof R is the union of the finite G-orbits of the one-element sets. Thus, if G has no\nfinite orbit, the kernel of R is empty. Hence from Theorem 0.2, A[G] is an integral\ndomain, as conjectured by Cameron.\nWe deduce Theorem 0.2 from a combinatorial property of a set algebra over a field\n(Theorem 0.3 below). This property does not depends upon the field, provided that\nits characteristic is zero. The proof we give in Section 1.1 is an extension of our\n\n\fA CONJECTURE OF P.J. CAMERON\n\n3\n\n1970 proof that the profile of an infinite relational structure does not decrease (see\nTheorem 0.5 below). The key tool we used then was Ramsey's theorem presented in\nterms of a property of almost-chainable relations. Here, these relations are replaced by\nF \u2212 L-invariant relational structures, structures which appeared, under other names,\nin several of our papers (see [24], [25], [27]). The final step is reminiscent of the proof\nof the integrity of a shuffle algebra.\nWe introduced the notion of kernel in[24] and studied it in several papers [25] [26],\n[27] and [29]. As it is easy to see (cf [25][29]), the kernel of a relational structure\nR is empty if and only if for every finite subset F of E there is a disjoint subset F \u2032\nsuch that the restrictions R|F and R|F \u2032 are isomorphic. Hence, relational structures\nwith empty kernel are those for which their age has the disjoint embedding property,\nmeaning that two arbitrary members of the age can be embedded into a third in\nsuch a way that their domain are disjoint. In Fra\u0131\u0308ss\u00e9's terminology, ages with the\ndisjoint embedding property are said inexhaustible and relational structures whose\nage is inexhaustible are said age-inexhaustible; we say that relational structures with\nfinite kernel are almost age-inexhaustible. 1\n0.3. A transversality property of the set algebra. Let K be a field with characteristic zero. Let E be a set and let [E]<\u03c9 be the set of finite subsets of E (including\n<\u03c9\nthe empty set \u2205). Let K[E] be the set of maps f : [E]<\u03c9 \u2192 K. Endowed with the\nusual addition and scalar multiplication of maps, this set is a vector space over K.\n<\u03c9\nLet f, g \u2208 K[E] and Q \u2208 [E]<\u03c9 . Set:\nX\n(2)\nf g(Q) =\nf (P )g(Q \\ P )\nP \u2208[Q]<\u03c9\n\nWith this operation added, the above set becomes a K-algebra. This algebra is\ncommutative and it has a unit, denoted by 1. This is the map taking the value 1\non the empty set and the value 0 everywhere else. The set algebra is the subalgebra\nmade of maps f such that f (P ) = 0 for every P \u2208 [E]<\u03c9 with |P | large enough.\nThis algebra is graded, the homogeneous component of degree n being made of maps\nwhich take the value 0 on every subset of size different from n (see Cameron [6]). If\nf and g belong to two homogeneous components, their product is given by Equation\n(1), thus an age algebra, or a group algebra, A, as previously defined, is a subalgebra\nof this set algebra. The set algebra is far from to be an integral domain. But, with\nthe notion of degree, the integrity of A will reduce to the fact that if m and n are\ntwo non negative integers and f : [E]m \u2192 K, f : [E]n \u2192 K are two non-zero maps\nbelonging to A, their product f g is non zero.\nLet H be a family of subsets of E, a subset T of E is a transversal of H if F \u2229 T 6= \u2205\nfor every F \u2208 H; the transversality of H, denoted \u03c4 (H), is the minimum of the\ncardinalities (possibly infinite) of transversals of H. We make the convention that\n\u03c4 (H) = 0 if H is empty.\nLet f : [E]m \u2192 K, denote supp(f ) := {P \u2208 [V ]m : f (P ) 6= 0}.\n1In\n\norder to agree with Fra\u0131\u0308ss\u00e9's terminology, we disagree with the terminology of our papers, in\nwhich inexhaustibility, resp. almost inexhaustibility, is used for relational structures with empty,\nresp. finite, kernel, rather than for their ages.\n\n\f4\n\nMAURICE POUZET\n\nHere is our combinatorial result:\nTheorem 0.3. Let m, n be two non negative integers. There is an integer t such that\nfor every set E with at least m + n elements, every field K with characteristic zero,\nevery pair of maps f : [E]m \u2192 K, g : [E]n \u2192 K such that f g is zero, but f and g are\nnot, then \u03c4 (supp(f ) \u222a supp(g)) \u2264 t.\nWith this result, the proof of Theorem 0.2 is immediate. Indeed, let R be a relational structure with empty kernel. If K.A(R), the age algebra of R over K, is not an\nintegral domain there are two non-zero maps f : [E]m \u2192 K, f : [E]n \u2192 K belonging\nto K.A(R), whose product f g is zero. Since K is an integral domain, none of the integers m and n can be zero. Since f is R-invariant, m is positive and the kernel K(R)\nof R is empty, it turns out that \u03c4 (supp(f )) is infinite. Hence \u03c4 (supp(f ) \u222a supp(g)) is\ninfinite, contradicting the conclusion of Theorem 0.3.\nAn other immediate consequence of Theorem 0.3 is the fact, due to Cameron, that\non an infinite set E, e is not a zero-divisor (see Theorem 0.8 below).\n0.3.1. Existence and values of \u03c4 . The fact the size of a transversal can be bounded\nindependently of f and g, and the value of the least upper bound, seem to be of\nindependent interest.\nSo, let \u03c4 (m, n) be the least t for which the conclusion of Theorem 0.3 holds.\nTrivially, we have \u03c4 (m, n) = \u03c4 (n, m). We have \u03c4 (0, n) = \u03c4 (m, 0) = 0. Indeed,\nif m = 0, f is defined on the empty set only, an thus f g(Q) = f (\u2205)g(Q). Since\nK has no non zero divisors, f g is non zero provided that f and g are non zero.\nThe fact that there is no pair f, g such that f g is zero, but f and g are not, yields\n\u03c4 (supp(f ) \u222a supp(g)) = 0.\nWe have \u03c4 (1, n) = 2n (Theorem 2.4). This is a non-trivial fact which essentially\namounts to a weighted version of the Gottlieb-Kantor Theorem on incidence matrices\n([15], [19], see subsection 0.4 and Theorem 2.3). These are the only exact values\nwe know. We prove that \u03c4 (m, n) exists, by supposing that \u03c4 (m \u2212 1, n) exists. Our\nexistence proof relies in an essential way on Ramsey theorem. It yields astronomical\nupper bounds. For example, it yields \u03c4 (2, 2) \u2264 2(Rk2 (4) + 2) , where k = 530 and\nRk2 (4) is the Ramsey number equal to the least integer p such that for every colouring\nof the pairs of {1, . . . , p} into k colors there are four integers whose all pairs have\nthe same colour. The only lower bound we have is \u03c4 (2, 2) \u2265 7 and more generally\n\u03c4 (m, n) \u2265 (m + 1)(n + 1) \u2212 2. We cannot preclude a extremely simple upper bound\nfor \u03c4 (m, n), eg quadratic in n + m.\n0.4. Age algebra and profile of a relational structure. The group agebra was\ninvented by Cameron in order to study the behavior of the function \u03b8G which counts\nfor each integer n the number \u03b8G (n) of orbits of n-subsets of a set E on which acts a\npermutation group G, a function that we call the orbital profile of G. Groups for which\nthe orbital profile takes only finite values are quite important. Called oligomorphic\ngroups by Cameron, they are an objet of study by itself (see Cameron's book[5]).\nWe present first some properties of the profile, a counting function somewhat more\ngeneral. Next, we present the link with the age algebra, then we gives an illustration\nof Theorem 0.2. We conclude with some problems.\n\n\fA CONJECTURE OF P.J. CAMERON\n\n5\n\n0.4.1. Profile of a relational structure. The profile of a relational structure R with\nbase E is the function \u03c6R which counts for every integer n the number (possibly\ninfinite) \u03c6R (n) of substructures of R induced on the n-element subsets, isomorphic\nsubstructures being identified. Clearly, if R encodes a permutation groups G, \u03c6R (n)\nis the number \u03b8G (n) of orbits of n-element subsets of E.\nIf the signature \u03bc is finite (in the sense that I is finite), there are only finitely\nmany relational structures with signature \u03bc on an n-element domain, hence \u03c6R (n) is\nnecessarily an integer for each integer n. In order to capture examples coming from\nalgebra and group theory, one cannot preclude I to be infinite. But then, \u03c6R (n) could\nbe an infinite cardinal. As far as one is concerned by the behavior of \u03c6R , this case\ncan be excluded:\nFact 0.4. [28] Let n < |E|. Then\n\u03c6R (n) \u2264 (n + 1)\u03c6R (n + 1)\n\n(3)\nIn particular:\n(4)\n\nIf \u03c6R (n) is infinite then \u03c6R (n + 1) is infinite too and \u03c6R (n) \u2264 \u03c6R (n + 1).\n\nInequality (3) can be substantially improved:\nTheorem 0.5. If R is a relational structure on an infinite set then \u03c6R is nondecreasing.\nThis result was conjectured with R.Fra\u0131\u0308ss\u00e9 [14]. We proved it in 1971; the proof for a single relation- appeared in 1971 in R.Fra\u0131\u0308ss\u00e9's book [12], Exercise 8 p. 113; the\ngeneral case was detailed in [26]. The proof relies on Ramsey theorem [32].\nMore is true:\nTheorem 0.6. If R is a relational structure on a set E having at least 2n + m\nelements then \u03c6R (n) \u2264 \u03c6R (n + m).\nMeaning that if |E| := l then \u03c6R increases up to 2l ; and, for n \u2265 2l the value in n\nis at least the value of the symmetric of n w.r.t. 2l .\nThe result is a straightforward consequence of the following property of incidence\nmatrices.\nLet m, n, l be three non-negative integers and E be an l-element set. Let Mn,n+m\nbe the matrix whose rows are indexed by the n-element subsets P of E and columns\nby the n + m-element subsets Q of E, the coefficient aP,Q being equal to 1 if P \u2286 Q\nand equal to 0 otherwise.\nTheorem 0.7. If 2n+ m \u2264 l then Mn,n+m has full row rank (over the field of rational\nnumbers).\nTheorem 0.7 is in W.Kantor 1972 [19], with similar results for affine and vector\nsubspaces of a vector space. Over the last 30 years, it as been applied and rediscovered many times; recently, it was pointed out that it appeared in a 1966 paper\nof D.H.Gottlieb [15]. Nowadays, this is one of the fundamental tools in algebraic\ncombinatorics. A proof, with a clever argument leading to further developments, was\ngiven by Fra\u0131\u0308ss\u00e9 in the 1986's edition of his book, Theory of relations, see [13].\n\n\f6\n\nMAURICE POUZET\n\nWe proved Theorem 0.6 in 1976 [23]. The same conclusion was obtained first\nfor orbits of finite permutation groups by Livingstone and Wagner, 1965 [20], and\nextended to arbitrary permutation groups by Cameron, 1976 [3]. His proof uses the\ndual version of Theorem 0.7. Later on, he discovered a nice translation in terms of\nhis age algebra, that we present now.\nFor that, observe that \u03c6R only depends upon the age of R and, moreover, if \u03c6R take\nonly integer values, then K.A(R) identifies with the set of (finite) linear combinations\nof members of A(R). In this case, as pointed out by Cameron, \u03c6R (n) is the dimension\nof the homogeneous component of degree n of K.A(R).\n<\u03c9\nLet e \u2208 K[E] be the map which is 1 on the one-element subsets of E and 0\nelsewhere. Let U be the subalgebra generated by e. We can think of e as the sum of\nisomorphic types of the one-element restrictions of R. Members of U are then of the\nform \u03bbm em + * * * + \u03bb1 e + \u03bb0 1 where 1 is the isomorphic type of the empty relational\nstructure and \u03bbm , . . . , \u03bb0 are in K. Hence U is graded, with Un , the homogeneous\ncomponent of degree n, equals to K.en .\nHere is the Cameron's result:\nTheorem 0.8. If R is infinite then, for every u \u2208 K.A(R), eu = 0 if and only if\nu=0\nThis innocent looking result implies that \u03c6R is non decreasing. Indeed, the image of\na basis of K.A(R)n by multiplication by em is an independent subset of K.A(R)n+m .\n0.4.2. Growth rate of the profile. Infinite relational structures with a constant profile,\nequal to 1, were called monomorphic and characterized by R. Fra\u0131\u0308ss\u00e9 who proved that\nthey were chainable. Later on, those with bounded profile, called finimorphic, were\ncharacterized as almost chainable [14]. Groups with orbital profile equal to 1 were\ndescribed by P.Cameron in 1976 [3]. From his characterization, Cameron obtained\nthat an orbital profile is ultimately constant, or grows as fast as a linear function with\nslope 12 .\nThe age algebra can be also used to study the growth of the profile.\nIf A is a graded algebra, the Hilbert function hA of A is the function which associates\nto each integer n the dimension of the homogeneous component of degree n. So,\nprovided that it takes only finite values, the profile \u03c6R is the Hilbert function of the\nage algebra C.A(R). In [10], Cameron made the following important observation\nabout the behavior of the Hilbert fonction.\nTheorem 0.9. Let A be a graded algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. If A is an integral domain the values of the Hilbert function hA satisfy\nthe inequality\n(5)\n\nhA (n) + hA (m) \u2212 1 \u2264 hA (n + m)\n\nfor all non-negative integers n and m.\nThis result has an immediate consequence on the growth of the profile:\nTheorem 0.10. [26] The growth of the profile of a relational structure with empty\nkernel is at least linear provided that it is unbounded.\n\n\fA CONJECTURE OF P.J. CAMERON\n\n7\n\nIn fact, provided that the relational structures satisfy some mild conditions, the\nexistence of jumps in the behavior of the profile extends.\nLet \u03c6 : N \u2192 N and \u03c8 : N \u2192 N. Recall that \u03c6 = O(\u03c8) and \u03c8 grows as fast as \u03c6\nif \u03c6(n) \u2264 a\u03c8(n) for some positive real number a and n large enough. We say that\n\u03c6 and \u03c8 have the same growth if \u03c6 grows as fast as \u03c8 and \u03c8 grows as fast as \u03c6.\nThe growth of \u03c6 is polynomial of degree k if \u03c6 has the same growth as n \u0592\u2192 nk ; in\nother words there are positive real numbers a and b such that ank \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 bnk for n\nlarge enough. Note that the growth of \u03c6 is as fast as every polynomial if and only if\nlimn\u2192+\u221e \u03c6(n)\n= +\u221e for every non negative integer k.\nnk\nTheorem 0.11. Let R := (E, (\u03c1i )i\u2208I ) be a relational structure. The growth of \u03c6R\nis either polynomial or as fast as every polynomial provided that either the signature\n\u03bc := (ni )i\u2208I is bounded or the kernel K(R) of R is finite.\nTheorem 0.11 is in [24]. An outline of the proof is given in [28]. A part appeared in\n[26], with a detailed proof showing that the growth of unbounded profiles of relational\nstructures with bounded signature is at least linear.\nThe kernel of any relational structure which encodes an oligomorphic permutation\ngroup is finite (indeed, as already mentionned, if R encodes a permutation group G\nacting on a set E then K(R) is the set union of the finite orbits of the one-element\nsubsets of E. Since the number of these orbits is at most \u03b8G (1), K(R) is finite if G is\noligomorphic). Hence:\nCorollary 0.12. The orbital profile of an oligomorphic group is either polynomial or\nfaster than every polynomial.\nFor groups, and graphs, there is a much more precise result than Theorem 0.11. It\nis due to Macpherson, 1985 [22].\nTheorem 0.13. The profile of a graph or a permutation groups grows either as a\n1 \u2212\u03b5\npolynomial or as fast as f\u03b5 , where f\u03b5 (n) = en 2 , this for every \u03b5 > 0.\n0.4.3. Growth rate and finite generation. A central question in the study of the profile,\nraised first by Cameron in the case of oligomorphic groups, is this:\nProblem 1. If the profile of a relational structures R with finite kernel has polynomial\n\u2032\ngrowth, is \u03c6R (n) \u2243 cnk for some positive real c and some non-negative integer k \u2032 ?\nLet us associate to a relational structure R whose profile takes only finite values\nits generating series\n\u221e\nX\n\u03c6R (n)xn\nH\u03c6R :=\nn=0\n\nProblem 2. If R has a finite kernel and \u03c6R is bounded above by some polynomial,\nis the series H\u03c6R a rational fraction of the form\n(6)\nwith P \u2208 Z[x]?\n\nP (x)\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 x2 ) * * * (1 \u2212 xk )\n\n\f8\n\nMAURICE POUZET\n\nUnder the hypothesis above we do not know if H\u03c6R is a rational fraction.\nP (x)\nIt is well known that if a generating function is of the form (1\u2212x)(1\u2212x\n2 )***(1\u2212xk ) then\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfor n large enough, an is a quasi-polynomial of degree k , with k \u2264 k \u2212 1, that is\n\u2032\na polynomial ak\u2032 (n)nk + * * * + a0 (n) whose coefficients ak\u2032 (n), . . . , a0 (n) are periodic\nfunctions. Hence, a subproblem is:\nProblem 3. If R has a finite kernel and \u03c6R is bounded above by some polynomial,\nis \u03c6R (n) a quasi-polynomial for n large enough?\nRemark 0.14. Since the profile is non-decreasing, if \u03c6R (n) is a quasi-polynomial for\nn large enough then ak\u2032 (n) is eventually constant. Hence the profile has polynomial\n\u2032\ngrowth in the sense that \u03c6R (n) \u223c cnk for some positive real c and k \u2032 \u2208 N. Thus, in\nthis case, Problem 1 has a positive solution.\nA special case was solved positively with N.Thi\u00e9ry [30].\nThese problems are linked with the structure of the age algebra. Indeed, if a\ngraded algebra A is finitely generated, then, since A is a quotient of a polynomial\nring K[x1 , . . . , xd ], its Hilbert function is bounded above by a polynomial. And, in\nP (x)\nfact, as it is well known, its Hilbert series is a fraction of form (1\u2212x)\nd , thus of the form\ngiven in (6). Moreover, one can choose a numerator with non-negative coefficients\nwhenever the algebra is Cohen-Macaulay. Due to Problem 2, one could be tempted\nto conjecture that these sufficient conditions are necessary in the case of age agebras.\nIndeed, from Theorem 0.8 one deduces easily:\nTheorem 0.15. The profile of R is bounded if and only if K.A(R) is finitely generated\nas a module over U, the graded algebra generated by e. In particular, if one of these\nequivalent conditions holds, K.A(R) is finitely generated\nBut this case is exceptional. The conjecture can be disproved with tournaments.\nIndeed, on one hand, there are tournaments whose profile has arbitrarily large polynomial growth rate and, on an other hand, the age algebra of a tournament is finitely\ngenerated if and only if the profile of the tournament is bounded (this result was\nobtained with N.Thiery, a proof is presented in [28]).\n0.4.4. Initial segments of an age and ideals of a ring. No concrete description of\nrelational structures with bounded signature, or finite kernel, which have polynomial\ngrowth is known. In [24] (see also [28]) we proved that if a relational structure R\nhas this property then its age, A(R), is well-quasi-ordered under embeddability, that\nis every final segment of A(R) is finitely generated, which amounts to the fact that\nthe collection F (A(R)) of final segments of A(R) is noetherian, w.r.t. the inclusion\norder. Since the fundamental paper of Higman[17], applications of the notion of\nwell-quasi-ordering have proliferated (eg see the Robertson-Seymour's theorem for an\napplication to graph theory [11] ). Final segments play for posets the same role than\nideals for rings. Noticing that an age algebra is finitely generated if and only if it is\nnoetherian, we are lead to have a closer look at the relationship between the basic\nobjects of the theory of relations and of ring theory, particularly ages and ideals.\nWe mention the following result which will be incorporated into a joint paper with\nN.Thi\u00e9ry.\n\n\fA CONJECTURE OF P.J. CAMERON\n\n9\n\nProposition 0.16. Let A be the age of a relational structure R such that the profile\nof R takes only finite values and K.A be its age algebra. If A\u2032 is an initial segment\nof A then:\n(i) The vector subspace J := K.(A \\ A\u2032 ) spanned by A \\ A\u2032 is an ideal of K.A.\nMoreover, the quotient of K.A by J is a ring isomorphic to the ring K.A\u2032 .\n(ii) If this ideal is irreducible then A\u2032 is a subage of A.\n(iii) This is a prime ideal if and only if A\u2032 is an inexhaustible age.\nThe proof of Item (i) and Item (ii) are immediate. The proof of Item (iii) is\nessentially based on Theorem 0.2.\nAccording to Item (i), F (A) embeds into the collection of ideals of K.A). Consequently:\nCorollary 0.17. If an age algebra is finitely generated then the age is well-quasiordered by embeddability.\nProblem 4. How the finite generation of an age algebra translates in terms of embeddability between members of the ages?\n0.4.5. Links with language theory. In the theory of languages, one of the basic results\nis that the generating series of a regular language is a rational fraction (see [1]). This\nresult is not far away from our considerations. Indeed, if A is a finite alphabet, with\nsay k elements, and A\u2217 is the set of words over A, then each word can be viewed as a\nfinite chain coloured by k colors. Hence A\u2217 can be viewed as the age of the relational\nstructure R made of the chain Q of rational numbers divided into k colors in such\na way that, between two distinct rational numbers, all colors appear. Moreover, as\npointed out by Cameron [6], the age algebra Q.A(R) is isomorphic to the shuffle\nalgebra over A, an important object in algebraic combinatorics (see [21]).\nProblem 5. Does the members of the age of a relational structure with polynomial\ngrowth can be coded by words forming a regular language?\nProblem 6. Extend the properties of regular languages to subsets of the collection\n\u03a9\u03bc made of isomorphic types of finite relational structures with signature \u03bc.\n1. Proof of Theorem 0.3\nThe proof idea of Theorem 0.3 is very simple and we give it first.\nWe prove the result by induction. We suppose that it holds for pairs (m \u2212 1, n).\nNow, let f : [E]m \u2192 K and g : [E]n \u2192 K such that f g is zero, but f and g are not.\nAs already mentionned, m and n are non zero, hence members of supp(f ) \u222a supp(g)\nare non empty. Let sup(f, g) := {(A, B) \u2208 supp(f ) \u00d7 supp(g) : A \u2229 B = \u2205}. We\nmay suppose sup(f, g) 6= \u2205, otherwise the conclusion of Theorem 0.3 holds with t :=\nm + n \u2212 1. For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that K := Q. In this case, we color\nelements A of [E]m into three colors :-,0, +, according to the value of f (A). We do the\nsame with elements B of [E]n and we color each member (A, B) of supp(f, g) with the\ncolors of its components. With the help of Ramsey' theorem and a lexicographical\nordering, we prove that if the transversality is large enough there is an (m+n)-element\nsubset Q such that all pair (A, B) \u2208 supp(f, g)(Q) := supp(f, g) \u2229 ([Q]m \u00d7 [Q]n ) have\n\n\f10\n\nMAURICE POUZET\n\nthe same color. This readily implies that f g(Q) 6= 0, a contradiction. If K 6= Q, we\nmay replace the three colors by five, as the following lemma indicates.\nLemma 1.1. Let K be a field with characteristic zero. There is a partition of K\u2217 :=\nK \\ {0} into at most four blocks such that for every integer k and every k-element\n\u2032\nsequences (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k ) \u2208 D k , (\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2k ) \u2208 D k , where D, D \u2032 are two blocks of the\nP\npartition of K\u2217 , then ki=1 \u03b1i \u03b2i \u2208 K\u2217 .\nProof. This holds trivially if K := C. For an example, divide C\u2217 into the sets\n\u2264 Argz < \u03c0(i+1)\n} (i < 4). If K is arbitrary, use the ComDi := {z \u2208 C\u2217 : \u03c0i\n2\n2\npactness theorem of first-order logic, under the form of the \"diagram method\" of\nA.Robinson [18]. Namely, to the language of fields, add names for the elements of\nK, a binary predicate symbol, and axioms, this in such a way that a model, if any,\nof the resulting theory T will be an extension of K with a partition satisfying the\nconclusion of the lemma. According to the Compactness theorem of first-order logic,\nthe existence of a model of T , alias the consistency of T , reduces to the consistency of\nevery finite subset A of T . A finite subset A of T leads to a finitely generated subfield\nof K. Such subfield is isomorphic to a subfield of C (see [18] Example 2, p.99, or [2]\nProposition 1, p. 108). This latter subfield equipped with the partition induced by\nthe partition existing on C\u2217 satisfies the conclusion of the lemma, hence is a model\nof T , proving that A is consistent.\nLet T\u2217 be the set of these four blocks, let T := T \u222a {0} and let \u03c7 be the map from\nK onto T.\n1.1. Invariant relational structures and their age algebra.\n1.1.1. Isomorphism, local isomorphism. Let R := (E, (\u03c1i )i\u2208I ) and R\u2032 := (E \u2032 , (\u03c1\u2032i )i\u2208I )\nbe two relational structures having the same signature \u03bc := (mi )i\u2208I . A map h : E \u2192\nE \u2032 is an isomorphism from R onto R\u2032 if\n(1) h is bijective,\n(2) (x1 , . . . , xmi ) \u2208 \u03c1i if and only if (h(x1 ), . . . , h(xmi )) \u2208 \u03c1\u2032i for every (x1 , . . . , xmi ) \u2208\nE mi , i \u2208 I.\nA partial map of E is a map h from a subset A of E onto a subset A\u2032 of E, these\nsubsets are the domain and codomain of h. A local isomorphism of R if a partial map\nh which is an isomorphism from R\u21beA onto R\u21beA\u2032 (where A and A\u2032 are the domain an\ncodomain of h).\n1.1.2. Invariant relational structures. A chain is a pair L := (C, \u2264) where \u2264 is a\nlinear order on C. Let L be a chain. Let V be a non-empty set, F be a set disjoint\nfrom V \u00d7 C and let E := F \u222a (V \u00d7 C). Let R be a relational structure with base set\nE. Let r be a non-negative integer, r \u2264 |C|. Let X, X \u2032 \u2208 [C]r . Let l be the unique\norder isomorphism from L\u21beX onto L\u21beX \u2032 and let l := 1F \u222a (1V , l) be the partial map\nsuch that l(x) = x for x \u2208 F and l(x, y) = (x, l(y)) for (x, y) \u2208 V \u00d7 X.\nWe say that X and X \u2032 are equivalent if l is an isomorphism of H\u21beF \u222aV \u00d7X onto\nH\u21beF \u222aV \u00d7X \u2032 . This defines an equivalence relation on [C]r .\n\n\fA CONJECTURE OF P.J. CAMERON\n\n11\n\nWe say that R is r\u2212F \u2212L-invariant if two arbitrary members of [C]r are equivalent.\nWe say that R is F \u2212 L-invariant if it is r \u2212 F \u2212 L-invariant for every non-negative\ninteger r, r \u2264 |C|.\nIt is easy to see that if the signature \u03bc of R is bounded and r := Max({mi : i \u2208 I}),\nR is F \u2212 L-invariant if and only if it is r \u2032 \u2212 F \u2212 L-invariant for every r \u2032 \u2264 r. In fact:\nLemma 1.2. If |C| > r := Max({mi : i \u2208 I}), R is F \u2212 L-invariant if and only if it\nis r \u2212 F \u2212 L-invariant.\nThis is an immediate consequence of the following lemma:\nLemma 1.3. If R is r \u2212 F \u2212 L-invariant and r < |C| then R is r \u2032 \u2212 F \u2212 L-invariant\nfor all r \u2032 \u2264 r.\nProof. We only prove that R is (r \u2212 1) \u2212 F \u2212 L-invariant. This suffices. Let X, X \u2032 \u2208\n[C]r\u22121 . Since r < |C|, we may select Z \u2208 [C]r such that the last element of Z (w.r.t.\nthe order L) is strictly below some element c \u2208 C.\nClaim 1.4. There are Y, Y \u2032 \u2208 [Z]r\u22121 which are equivalent to X and X \u2032 respectively.\nProof of Claim 1.4. Extend X and X \u2032 to two r-element subsets X1 and X1\u2032 of C.\nSince R is r \u2212 F \u2212 L-invariant, X1 is equivalent to Z, hence the unique isomorphism\nfrom L\u21beX1 onto L\u21beZ carries X onto an equivalent subset Y of Z. By the same token,\nX1\u2032 is equivalent to a subset Y \u2032 of Z.\nClaim 1.5. Y and Y \u2032 are equivalent.\nProof of Claim 1.5. The unique isomorphism from L\u21beY \u222a{c} onto L\u21beY \u2032 \u222a{c} carries\nY onto Y hence T and Y \u2032 are equivalent.\nFrom the two claims above X and X \u2032 are equivalent. Hence, R is (r \u2212 1) \u2212 F \u2212 Linvariant.\nS\n1.1.3. Coding by words. Let A := P(V ) \\ {\u2205}. Let A\u2217 := p<\u03c9 Ap be the set of\nfinite sequences of members of A. A finite sequence u being viewed as a word on the\nalphabet A, we write it as a juxtaposition of letters and we denote by \u03bb the empty\nsequence; the length of u, denoted by |u| is the number of its terms. Let p be a non\nnegative integer. If X is a subset of p := {0, . . . , p \u2212 1} and u a word of length p,\nthe restriction of u to X induces a word that we denote by t(u\u21beX ). We suppose that\nV is finite and we equip A with a linear order. We compare words with the same\nlength with the lexicographical order, denoted by \u2264lex . We record without proof the\nfollowing result.\nLemma 1.6. Let p, q be two non negative integers and X be an p-element subset of\np + q := {0, . . . , p + q \u2212 1}. The map from Ap \u00d7 Aq into Ap+q which associates to\nevery pair (u, v) \u2208 Ap \u00d7 Aq the unique word w \u2208 Ap+q such that t(w\u21beX ) = u and\nt(w\u21bep+q\\X ) = v is strictly increasing (w.r.t. the lexicographical order).\nThis word w is a shuffle of u and v that we denote uX v. We denote by u b v the\nlargest word of the form uX v.\nWe order A\u2217 with the radix order defined as follows: if u and v are two distincts\nwords, we set u < v if and only if either |u| < |v| or |u| = |v| et u <lex v. We suppose\n\n\f12\n\nMAURICE POUZET\n\nthat F is finite and we order P(F ) in such a way that X < Y implies |X| \u2265 |Y |.\nFinally, we order P(F ) \u00d7 A\u2217 lexicographically.\nLet L := (C, \u2264). Let Q be a finite subset of E := F \u222a (V \u00d7 C). Let proj(Q) :=\n{i \u2208 C : Q \u2229 V \u00d7 {i} =\n6 \u2205}. Let i0 , . . . , ip\u22121 be an enumeration of proj(Q) in an\nincreasing order (w.r.t L) and let w(Q \\ F ) be the word u0 . . . up\u22121 \u2208 A\u2217 such that\nQ \\ F = u0 \u00d7 {i0 } \u222a * * * \u222a up\u22121 \u00d7 {ip\u22121 }. We set w(Q) := (Q \u2229 F, w(Q \\ F )). If Q is a\nsubset of [E]<\u03c9 , we set w(Q) := {w(Q) : Q \u2208 Q}. If f : [E]m \u2192 K, let lead(f ) := \u2212\u221e\nif f = 0 and otherwise let lead(f ) be the largest element of w(supp(f )). We show\nbelow that this latter parameter behaves as the degree of a polynomial.\nWe start with an easy fact.\nLemma 1.7. Let m and n be two non negative integers, A \u2208 [E\\F ]m and B \u2208 [E]n . If\n|C| \u2265 m+n there is A\u2032 \u2208 [E\\F ]m such that proj(A\u2032 )\u2229proj(B) = \u2205 and w(A\u2032 ) = w(A).\nLemma 1.8. Let R be an F \u2212 L-invariant structure on E.

Since supp(f ) \u2229 [E \\ F ]m 6= \u2205 and the order on P(F )\ndecreases with the size, A0 is disjoint from F . Let B \u2208 supp(g). According to\nLemma 1.7 there is A\u2032 such that proj(A\u2032 ) \u2229 proj(B) = \u2205 and w(A\u2032 ) = w(A0 ).\nWe have A\u2032 \u2229 B = \u2205 and, since f \u2208 K.A(R) and R is F \u2212 L-invariant,\nf (A\u2032 ) = f (A0 ). Thus (A\u2032 , B) \u2208 supp(f, g).\n(2) Proof of (8). Let (A, B) \u2208 supp(f, g)(Q0).

Let\nQ\u2032 := A\u2032 \u222a B. By maximality of w(Q0 ), we have w(Q\u2032 ) \u2264 w(Q0 ). If B \u2229 F 6=\nQ0 \u2229 F , then |Q\u2032 \u2229 F | < |Q0 \u2229 F |, hence w(Q0 ) < w(Q\u2032 ). A contradiction.\nThe fact that A \u2229 F = \u2205 follows.\nClaim 1.10. proj(A) \u2229 proj(B) = \u2205 and |proj(A)| = |proj(B).|\nApply Lemma 1.7. Let A\u2032 such that proj(A\u2032 ) \u2229 proj(B) = \u2205 and w(A\u2032 ) =\nw(A). Since f \u2208 K.A(R) and R is F \u2212 L-invariant, f (A\u2032 ) = f (A) thus\n(A\u2032 , B) \u2208 supp(f, g). Set Q\u2032 := A\u2032 \u222a B. We have w(Q\u2032 \\ F ) \u2264 w(Q0 \\ F )\nhence |w(Q\u2032 )| \u2264 |w(Q0)|. Since |w(Q\u2032 \\ F )| = |proj(A\u2032)| + |proj(B)| and\n|w(Q0 \\F )| \u2264 |proj(A)|+|proj(B)|, we get |w(Q0 \\F )| = |proj(A)|+|proj(B)|.\nThis proves our claim.\nLet i0 , . . . , ir\u22121 be an enumeration of proj(Q0 \\ F ) in an increasing order.\nLet X := {j \u2208 r : ij \u2208 proj(A)}. Since proj(A)\u2229proj(B) = \u2205, we have w(Q0 \\\nF ) = w(A)X w(B \\ F ). Since w(A) \u2264 w(A0 ) and |w(A)| = |w(A0)|, Lemma\n1.6 yields w(Q0 \\ F ) \u2264 w(A0)X w(B). As it is easy to see, there is A\u20320 such\nthat w(A\u20320 ) = w(A0 ) and Q\u2032 := A\u20320 \u222a B satisfies w(Q\u2032 \\ F ) = w(A0 )X w(B).\nSince (A\u2032 , B) \u2208 supp(f, g), we have w(Q\u2032) = w(Q0 ) by maximality of w(Q0 ).\nWith Lemma 1.6 again, this yields w(A) = w(A0 ). Hence w(A) = w(A0 ). A\nsimilar argument yields w(B \\ F ) = w(B0 \\ F ) and also w(B \\ F ) = w(B0 \\ F ).\n(3) Proof of (9). Since R is F \u2212 L-invariant, from w(A) = lead(f ) := w(A0 ) we\nget f (A) = f (A0 ). By the same token,\nP we get g(B) = g(B0).\n(4) Proof of (10). Since f g(Q0 ) = (A,B)\u2208sup(f,g) f (A)g(B) the result follows\nfrom (9).\n(5) Proof of (11). From (10), f g(Q0 ) 6= 0, the equality lead(f g) = lead(f, g)\nfollows. The remaining equality follows from (8).\nWith this, the proof of the lemma is complete.\nAs far as invariant structures are concerned, we can retain this:\nCorollary 1.11.

Let R := (E, (\u03c1(i,j) )(i,j)\u2208T\u2217 \u00d72) ) be the relational structure made of the\nfour m-ary relations \u03c1(i,0) := {(x1 , . . . , xm ) : \u03c7 \u25e6 f ({x1 , . . . , xm }) = i} and the four nary relations \u03c1(i,1) := {(x1 , . . . , xn ) : \u03c7 \u25e6 g({x1 , . . . , xn }) = i}. A map h from a subset\nA of E onto a subset A\u2032 of E is a local isomorphism of R if \u03c7 \u25e6 f (P ) = \u03c7 \u25e6 f (h[P ])\nand \u03c7 \u25e6 f (R) = \u03c7 \u25e6 f (h[R]) for every P \u2208 [A]m , every R \u2208 [A]n . This fact allows us\nto consider the pair H := (E, (\u03c7 \u25e6 f, \u03c7 \u25e6 g)) as a relational structure. In the sequel we\nsuppose that E = F \u222a (V \u00d7 C) with F and V finite; we fix a chain L := (C, \u2264).\nLemma 1.12.

Let lead(f, g) be the largest element of w({A \u222a B : (A, B) \u2208 supp(f, g)}) and\nlet Q0 such that w(Q0 ) = lead(f, g).\n\n\f14\n\nMAURICE POUZET\n\nClaim 1.13.

For every integers r, k, l there is an integer R such that for every\npartition of the r-element subsets of a R-element set C into k colors there is a lelement subset C \u2032 of C whose all r-element subsets have the same color.\nThe least integer R for which the conclusion of Theorem 1.14 holds is a Ramsey\nnumber that we denote Rkr (l).\n\u0001\nLet\u0001m and n be two non negative integers.

We give it for reader convenience. See [13] 10.9.4 page 296, or [27] Lemme IV.3.1.1 for a similar result).\nProof. The number of equivalence classes on [C]r is at most k := 5s (indeed, this\n\u2032 m\nnumber is bounded by the number of distinct pairs (\u03c7\u25e6f \u2032, \u03c7\u25e6g \u2032) such that f \u2032 \u2208 K[E ] ,\n\u2032 n\ng \u2032 \u2208 K[E ] and |E \u2032 | = n + mr). Thus, according to Theorem 1.14, there is a l-element\nsubset C \u2032 of C whose all r-element subsets are equivalent. This means that H\u21beF \u222aV \u00d7C \u2032\nis r \u2212 F \u2212 L\u21beC \u2032 -invariant.

Since the signature of H is bounded by r,\nH\u21beF \u222aV \u00d7C \u2032 is F \u2212 L\u21beC \u2032 -invariant from Lemma 1.2.\n1.2. The existence of \u03c4 (m, n).

From Lemma 1.16\n|supp(f ) \u222a (supp(g)| \u2264 |S| + \u03c4 (0, n) = |S| \u2264 2n.\nFor the converse inequality, we prove that:\nClaim 2.6. There is a 2n element set E and a map g : [E]n \u2192 K such that eg = 0\nand g 6= 0.\nProof of Claim 2.6 Let E := {0, 1} \u00d7 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}. Set Ei := {0, 1} \u00d7 {i} for\ni < n. Let B \u2208 [E]n . Set g(B) := 0 if B is not a transversal of the Ei 's, g(B) := \u22121 if\nB is a transversal containing an odd number of elements of the form (0, i), g(B) = 1\notherwise. Let Q \u2208 [E]n+1 . If Q is not a transversal of the Ei 's then g(B) = 0 for\nevery B \u2208 [Q]n hence eg(Q) = 0. If Q is a transversal, then there is a unique index i\nsuch that Ei \u2286 Q. In this case, the only members of [Q]n on which g is non-zero are\nQ \\ {(0, i)} and Q \\ {(1, i)}; by our choice, they have opposite signs, hence eg(Q) = 0.\nSince in the example above \u03c4 (supp(e)) = 2n, we have \u03c4 (1, n) \u2265 2n. With this\ninequality, the proof of Theorem 2.4 is complete.\n3. A lower bound for \u03c4 (m, n)\nLemma 3.1. \u03c4 (m, n) \u2265 (m + 1)(n + 1) \u2212 2 for all m, n \u2265 1.\nProof. For m = 1 this inequality was obtained in Claim 2.6. For the case m > 1, we\nneed the following improvement of Claim 2.6.\nClaim 3.2. Let n \u2265 1. There is a 2n element set E and a map g : [E]n \u2192 K such\nthat eg = 0 and supp(g) = [E]n .\nProof of Claim 3.2. Fix a 2n-element set E. From Claim 2.6 and the fact that the\nsymmetric group SE acts transitively on [E]n , we get for each B \u2208 [E]n some gB such\nthat egB = 0 and B \u2208 supp(gB ). Next, we observe that a map g : [E]n \u2192 K satisfies\n\n\f18\n\nMAURICE POUZET\nn\n\nn+1\n\neg = 0 if and only if g belongsP\nto the kernel of the linear map T : K[E] \u2192 K[E]\ndefined by setting T (g)(Q) := B\u2208[Q]n g(B) for all g, Q \u2208 [E]n+1 . To conclude, we\n\u0001\napply the claim below with k := 2n\n.\nn\nClaim 3.3. Let e1 := (1, 0 . . . , 0), . . . , ei := (0, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , ek := (0, . . . , 1) be\nthe canonical basis of Kk and let H be a subspace of Kk . Then H contains a vector\nwith all its coordinates which are non-zero if and only if for every coordinate i it\ncontains some vector with this coordinate non-zero.\nProof of Claim 3.3. This assertion amounts to the fact that a vector space on\nan infinite field is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces.\nLet E be the disjoint union of m sets\nFor\nP E0 , . . . , Ei , . . . Em\u22121 , each of size 2n.\nn\nn+1\neach i, let gi : [Ei ] \u2192 K such that B\u2208[Q]n gi (B) = 0 for each Q \u2208 [Ei ]\nand\nsupp(gi ) = [Ei ]n (according to Claim 3.2 such a gi exists). Let g : [E]n \u2192 K be\nthe \"direct sum\" of the gi 's: g(B) := gi (B) if B \u2208 [Ei ]n , g(B) := 0 otherwise. Let\nf : [E]m \u2192 K defined by setting f (A) := 1 if A \u2229 Ei 6= \u2205 for all i < m and 0\notherwise. Then, by a similar argument as in Claim 2.6, f g = 0. Next, a transversal\nof supp(f ) must contains some Ei (thus \u03c4 (supp(f )) = 2n). And, also, a transversal\nof supp(g) must be a transversal of each of the supp(gi )'s. Since supp(gi ) = [Ei ]n ,\n\u03c4 (supp(gi )) = n + 1, hence \u03c4 (supp(g)) = (n + 1)m. We get easily that \u03c4 (supp(f ) \u222a\nsupp(g)) = 2n + (n + 1)(m \u2212 1) = mn + m + n \u2212 1. This completes the proof of\nLemma 3.1.\nExample 3.4. The lemma above gives \u03c4 (2, 2) \u2265 7. An example illustrating this\ninequality is quite simple: let E be made of two squares, let f be the map giving value\n\u22121/2 on each side of the squares, value 1 on the diagonals; let g be giving value 1\non each pair meeting the two squares. Then for every x \u2208 E, E \\ {x} is a minimal\ntransversal of supp(f ) \u222a supp(g).\nReferences\n[1] J. Berstel, C. Retenauer.
