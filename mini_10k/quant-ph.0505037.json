Cavity dissipation leads to the quantitative reduction of information transfer though preserving the basic swapping property.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuantum entanglement is endowed with certain curious features. Unlike\nclassical correlations, quantum entanglement can not be freely shared among\nmany quantum systems. It has been observed that a quantum system being entangled with another one limits its possible entanglement with a third\nsystem. This has been dubbed the \"monogamous nature of entanglement\"\nwhich was first proposed by Bennett[1]. If a pair of two-level quantum systems A and B have a perfect quantum correlation,\nnamely, if they are in a\n\u221a\n\u2212\nmaximally entangled state \u03a8 = (|01i \u2212 |10i)/ 2, then the system A cannot\nbe entangled to a third system C. This indicates that there is a limitation\nin the distribution of entanglement, and several efforts have been devoted to\ncapture this unique property of \"monogamy of quantum entanglement\" in\na quantitative way for tripartite and multipartite systems[2, 3, 4]. Another\ndistinctive property of quantum entanglement for multipartite systems is the\npossibility of entanglement swapping between two or more pairs of qubits.\nUsing this property, two parties that never interacted in their history can be\nentangled[5]. There may indeed exist a deeper connection between the characteristics of \"monogamy\" and entanglement swapping since the features of\n1\n\nEmail: biplab@bose.res.in\nEmail: archan@bose.res.in\n3\nEmail: nayak@bose.res.in\n2\n\n1\n\n\fthe distribution and transfer of quantum information is essentially reflected\nin the both these properties.\nPractical realization of various features of quantum entanglement are\nobtained in atom-photon interactions in optical and microwave cavities[6].\nRecently, some studies have been performed to quantify the entanglement\nobtained between atoms through atom-photon interactions in cavities[7, 8].\nAn important attribute of real devices in the ubiquitous presence of dissipative effects in them. These have to be monitored in order for the effects\nof quantum correlations to survive till detection. The consequences of cavity leakage on information transfer in the micromaser has been quantified\nrecently[8]. It is natural to expect the other characteristics of entanglement\nsuch as its \"monogamous\" nature, and also its exchange or swapping to be\naffected by dissipative processes. Atom-photon interactions in cavities are a\nsound arena for the quantitative investigations of different aspects of quantum entanglement in realistic situations.\nWith the above motivation we perform a quantitative study of the monogamy of quantum entanglement and its swapping in dissipative atom-photon\ninteractions in microwave cavities. We focus on a system of two entangled\nsingle-mode cavities which are empty initially. We then consider the passage\nof a two-level atom through either or both of them. In the next section we\nfirst consider a tripartite pure system (two ideal cavities and one atom) and\nstudy the features of \"monogamy\" exhibited between the atom-cavity and\nthe cavity-cavity entanglements. In particular, we demonstrate the applicability of the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW)[3] \"monogamy\" inequality to\nthis system. We next consider a realistic cavity with photon leakage, and\nrepeat the above analysis keeping in mind the recently conjectured validity\nof the CKW inequality extended for mixed states[4]. We find that cavity\ndissipation could lead to interesting possibilities, such as the enhancement\nof the entanglement between the atom and the cavity mode that it interacts\nwith, a feature that could be understood by the \"monogamous\" behaviour\nof entanglement. In section IV we consider a four-qubit system (two cavities\nand two atoms) where our goal is to observe entanglement swapping, or the\ntransfer of entanglement from the initially entangled two cavities to the two\natoms. Here again, we first perform the analysis with ideal cavities, and then\nconsider the effects of cavity leakage on entanglement swapping. We present\nsome concluding remarks in section V.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nMonogamy of entanglement in a system of\ntwo cavities and a single atom\nPure state of three qubits\n\nWe first consider two ideal cavities which can be maximally entangled by\nsending a single circular Rydberg atom prepared in the exited state through\ntwo identical and initially empty high-Q cavities (C1 and C2 )[9]. The initial\nstate of the two-cavity entangled system can be written as\n1\n|\u03a8iC1 C2 = \u221a (|01 12 i + |11 02 i),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the index 1 and 2 refer to the first and second cavity, respectively.\nIn this set-up we consider the passage of a two-level Rydberg atom A1 prepared in the ground state |gi through the cavity C1 . We are considering the\nresonant interaction between the two-level atom and cavity mode frequency.\nThe interaction Hamiltonian in the rotating frame approximation for the\natom-cavity system is\nHI = g(\u03c3 + a + \u03c3 \u2212 a\u2020 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a\u2020 and a are usual creation and destruction operators of the radiation\nfield and \u03c3 + (\u03c3 \u2212 ) are atomic operators analogous to the Pauli spin raising and\nlowering operators obeying the commutation relation [\u03c3 + , \u03c3 \u2212 ] = 2\u03c3z , where\n\u03c3z = +1/2(\u22121/2) represents the atom in the upper (lower) state. g is the\natom-field interaction constant (or gt the Rabi angle). The dynamics of the\natom-photon interaction is governed by the equation\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[HI , \u03c1]\n\n(3)\n\nwith joint three-party initial (t = 0) state corresponding to\n1\n|\u03a8(t = 0)iC1 C2 A1 = \u221a (|0112 i + |11 02 i) \u2297 |g1 i\n2\n\n(4)\n\nHence, a two-level atom entering the empty cavity in the upper state (|ei)\nevolves to\n|\u03a8e (t)i = e\u2212iHI t |e, 0i\n= cos(gt)|e, 0i + sin(gt)|g, 1i\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fat some time t, and similarly, a two-level Rydberg atom entering the one\nphoton cavity in the ground state evolves to\n|\u03a8g (t)i = e\u2212iHI t |g, 1i\n= cos(gt)|g, 1i \u2212 sin(gt)|e, 0i\n\nC1\n\n(6)\n\nC2\n\nA1\n\nFigure 1: A two-level Rydberg atom prepared in the ground state is passing\nthrouh the one of the maximally entangled cavities C1\nFor any interaction time t the evolved state is given by\n|\u03a8(t)iC1 C2 A1 =\n\n1\n\u221a (|01 12 g1 i + cos gt|11 02 g1 i\n2\n\u2212 sin gt|01 02 e1 i)\n\n\u03c1(t)C1 C2 A1 = |\u03a8(t)C1 C2 A1 ih\u03a8(t)C1 C2 A1 |\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThe reduced density states of the pairs C1 C2 , C2 A1 , C1 A1 are given by\n\u03c1(t)C1 C2 = TrA1 (\u03c1(t)C1 C2 A1 ),\ncos2 gt\n1\n|01 12 ih01 12 | +\n|11 02 ih11 02 |\n=\n2\n2\nsin2 gt\ncos gt\n+\n|01 02 ih01 02 | +\n|01 12 ih11 02 |\n2\n2\ncos gt\n+\n|11 02 ih01 12 |.\n2\n\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\f\u03c1(t)C2 A1 = TrC1 (\u03c1(t)C1 C2 A1 ),\n1\ncos2 gt\n=\n|12 g1 ih12 g1 | +\n|02 g1 ih02 g1 |\n2\n2\nsin2 gt\nsin gt\n+\n|02 e1 ih02 e1 | \u2212\n|12 g1 ih02 e1 |\n2\n2\nsin gt\n\u2212\n|02e1 ih12 g1 |.\n2\n\n(10)\n\n\u03c1(t)C1 A1 = TrC2 (\u03c1(t)C1 C2 A1 ),\n1\ncos2 gt\n=\n|01 g1 ih01g1 | +\n|11g1 ih11g1 |\n2\n2\nsin gt cos gt\nsin2 gt\n|01 e1 ih01 e1 | \u2212\n|11 g1 ih01e1 |\n+\n2\n2\nsin gt cos gt\n\u2212\n|01 e1 ih11g1 |.\n(11)\n2\nWe now compute the mixed-state bipartite entanglement measure (Concurrence)[10]\nfor different pairs.

The dynamics of the flight of the atom is governed by the evolution equation\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u03c1\u0307|atom-field + \u03c1\u0307|field-reservoir ,\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\f1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\nC\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\ngt\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nFigure 2: C (\u03c1(t)C1 C2 ) (solid line), C (\u03c1(t)C2 A1 ), (dotted line), C (\u03c1C1 A1 ) (broken line) plotted with respect to the Rabi angle gt.\n\nwhere the strength of the couplings are given by the parameters \u03ba (the cavity\nleakage constant) and g (the atom-field interaction constant).

One of the basic features of information\nexchange between bipartite systems, represented by entanglement swapping,\nis thus seen to be preserved for mixed states too.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have considered two important and interesting features of\nquantum entanglement, viz., \"monogamy\", and entanglement swapping. We\nhave used the set-up of two initialy entangled cavites[9] and a single Rydberg\natom passing through one of them to study the quantitative manifestation of\na \"monogamy\" inequality[3] in atom-photon interactions. The unavoidable\nphoton leakage exists in all real cavities used for the practical realization\nof quantum information transfer. The effects of such dissipation have been\ninvestigated on the \"monogamous\" nature of the entanglement between the\ntwo cavities, on one hand, and the atom and the second cavity on the other.\nWe have found that the essential \"monogamous\" character is preserved even\nwith cavity dissipation. We have further seen that the entanglement between\nthe atom and the cavity through which it passes increases with larger dissipation, a feature that could be understood by invoking the \"monogamous\"\ncharacter of entanglement. We have then considered a set-up involving two\nentangled cavities, and two Rydberg atoms. Entanglement swapping from\nthe two cavities by the two atoms which never interact directly with each\nother is observed in this system. Cavity dissipation, of course reduces the\ntotal amount of information exchange, similar to the results obtained in the\ncontext of the single-atom micromaser[8]. Moreover, here we have verified\nthat the property of swapping is preserved with dissipation. Further studies\non different quantitative manifestations of information transfer in the presence of dissipative effects might be useful for the construction of realistic\ndevices implementing various protocols. Practical realization of two-cavity\nentanglement is in progress at the Ecole Normale Superieure[14].\n\nReferences\n[1] Bennett C.
