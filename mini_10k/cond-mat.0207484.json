Existing theoretical\nworks focus on exact diagonalization [9] of small number\nof atoms to get some idea about quantum melting and\nthe possible quantum Hall like melted states. A recent\ninteresting work [10] that studies melting of vortex lattices in a rapidly-rotating 2D BEC, also shows that BEC\nis destroyed by the vortex lattices.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe creation and observation of the triangular vortex\nlattices in a rapidly-rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [1\u20133] has opened a new direction for the\nstudy of quantum vortex matter. Theoretical predictions\n[4] for the existence of fractional quantum Hall like states\nat even higher rotational speeds in quasi two dimensional\natomic BEC has given a further impetus to this fascinating field. The quantum melting of an ordered vortex\nlattice to an exotic quantum fluid of atoms at very low\ntemperatures is a quantum phase transition, where one\nwould like to understand the mechanism of melting and\nnature of phase transition.\nMelting of classical solids with short range inter atomic\npotential in 2D is a well studied subject, where topological defects play a fundamental role. In the presence of\nlong range interaction, such as one component coulomb\nplasma in 2D, melting is dominated by ring exchanges [5]\nrather than topological defects. From this point of view\nthe logarithmic repulsion among the imposed vortices in\na rotating BEC provides an opportunity to study quantum melting of a 'pristine' Wigner solid with long range\nforces, that is free from the complications of solid state\nsystems.\nIn this letter we write down an effective Hamiltonian\nfor the vortex degrees of freedom, motivated by an analogy [6,7] between the Magnus force acting on a vortex\nmoving on a two dimensional neutral superfluid fluid and\nthe Lorenz force acting on a charged particle in a magnetic field. We develop a theoretical approach, borrowing\nheavily from pioneering ideas of Kivelson, Kallin, Arovas\nand Schrieffer (KKAS) [8], developed in the context of\nfractional quantized Hall effect (FQHE), and suggest a\ncooperative ring exchange (CRE) mechanism for quantum melting of vortex lattices in quasi 2D atomic BEC\nand indicate a possible direction for a microscopic understanding of the quantum liquid of molten vortices.\n\nExperimentally, at the present moment it is a challenging task to produce vortex liquid state in a rapidlyrotating atomic BEC, in contrast to the formation of an\nincompressible liquid state of electrons in a high magnetic\nfield at higher filling fractions. With the rapid advances\nin the field of laser cooled atomic gases one can anticipate to get 'snapshots' of the melted configurations of\nthe vortex lattices, where CRE should leave its unique\nsignatures as we mention at the end.\nIn the cooperative ring exchange approach to FQHE,\nKKAS view the Laughlin quantum Hall state as a Wigner\nsolid of electrons in 2D in strong magnetic field, that has\nbeen quantum melted by cooperative ring exchange processes. Briefly, ring exchange, as the name suggests, is a\ncooperative shift of a ring of contiguous particles in an\nordered lattice (figure 1) resulting in a cyclic permutation within the ring. While the amplitude for a quantum\ntunneling event of a specific ring of size L sites is exponentially small \u223c \u03b1L (with \u03b1, the single particle tunneling amplitude being < 1), the number of rings of size L\nis exponentially large \u223c ebL . Thus the total amplitude\n\u223c \u03b1L ebL may exponentially diverge, if \u2212 ln \u03b1 < b, leading to a proliferation of ring exchanges and a consequent\nquantum melting.\n1\n\n\fThis melting depends on the electronic filling fraction,\nthe ratio between the density of conduction electrons and\nthe density of flux quanta. For very low filling fraction,\nelectrons are expected to form a Wigner crystal. At\nhigher filling fraction, electrons forms an incompressible\nliquid state and exhibits quantized Hall effect. Similarly,\nwe could also expect the quantum melting of the vortex\nlattices depends on the vortex filling factor, the ratio of\nthe total number of vortex to the total number of boson.\n\nHv =\n\ni=1\n\n2mv\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n|ri \u2212 rj |\n2\u03c0h\u03042 \u03c10 X\nln\n,\nm0 i<j\n\u03be\n(3)\n\nwhere Nv is the total number of vortices. The effective vortex mass mv = \u03c0\u03c10 \u03be 2 can be in principle derived\nfrom a microscopic approach [6]. Since the coherence\nlength is very small, the vortex mass also becomes small.\nThis Hamiltonian is similar to that of a charged particles moving under the influence of the Lorentz force by\na magnetic field Beff . The pseudo vector potential due\nto the Magnus force is Aeff = \u2212 21 r \u00d7 Beff . For Nv number of vortices in an area A, one gets the vortex filling\nfactor, \u03bdv = NAv eBheff = NNv . Notice that the vortex filling factor \u03bdv is just inverse of the bosonic filing factor\n\u03bdb = NNv . For large Nv the vortex density is approximately uniform and Nv = 2m\u03c9A\nh . N is the number of\nthe superfluid\nparticles.\nThe\neffective magnetic length\nq\n1\n.\nThe\npseudomagnetic\nfield genis l0 = eBh\u0304eff = \u221a2\u03c0\u03c1\n0\nerated by the background superfluid particles leads to\nthe quantization of the cyclotron motion and producing\nLandau levels of the vortices. The eigen spectrum of\nthe single vortex Hamiltonian are uniformly spaced with\n0\nenergy gap h\u0304\u03c9eff , where \u03c9eff = 2\u03c0h\u0304\u03c1\nis the effective cymv\nclotron frequency. The limit of mv \u2192 0 and/or large\nsuperfluid density (\u03c10 ) is equivalent to the vortices are\nin the lowest Landau level (LLL). We can project the\nHamiltonian onto the LLL and the corresponding normalized wave functions are degenerate eigenfunctions of\nthe angular momentum m is,\n\nII. HAMILTONIAN OF THE VORTICES IN A\nROTATING QUASI-2D BEC\n\nWe consider a large number of vortices in a rapidly rotating quasi-2D BEC; the condition for the condensate in\na quasi-2D trap is \u03bc = \u03c10 g2 < h\u0304\u03c9z and the atoms in the\ncondensate should be in the atomic lowest Landau level\ngenerated by the fast external rotation\n\u221a is \u03c10 g2 < 2h\u0304\u03a9.\nHere, \u03c10 is the boson density, g2 = 2 2\u03c0h\u0304\u03c9z az a is the effective interaction\nstrength in quasi-2D Bose system [11],\nq\nh\u0304\nwhere az =\nmo \u03c9z is harmonic oscillator length along\nthe z-direction with \u03c9z is trap frequency in the axial (z)\ndirection and \u03a9 is the trap rotational frequency. Also,\na is the s-wave atomic scattering length. A vortex in a\nfluid is an excitation in which each fluid particle is given\nan angular momentum m relative to the vortex center.\nHere, we treat a vortex as a point particle moving under\nthe influence of the Magnus force. The Magnus force is\nan effective interaction between superfluid particles and\nvortices in relative motion [6,7]. The force acting on a\nsingle vortex [6] is then\n\nF = v \u00d7 \u1e91(2\u03c0h\u0304\u03c10 ).\n\nNv\nX\n(pi \u2212 \u03c0h\u0304\u03c10 \u1e91 \u00d7 ri )2\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\nm\n\nz e\n\u03c8(z) = p 2\n(2l0 )m+1 \u03c0m!\n\nHere, v is the vortex velocity relative to the superfluid\nparticles and \u03c10 is the superfluid particle density. The\nMagnus force is equivalent to the Lorentz force acting\non a charge particle (e) in a magnetic field. Hence,\neBeff = 2\u03c0h\u0304\u03c10 is the pseudo magnetic field.\nThe interaction potential between two vortices separated by a distance r is\n\u0012 \u0013\nr\n2\u03c0h\u03042 \u03c10\n,\n(2)\nln\nV (r) = \u2212\nm0\n\u03be\nq\naz\nwhere \u03be \u223c\n\u03c10 a is the coherence length of the vortex\n\n\u2212\n\n|z|2\n4l2\n0\n\n,\n\nm = 0, 1, 2, .... (4)\n\nwhere z = x + iy and (x, y) are the position coordinate\nof a vortex. When the vortices are confined to the lowest\nLandau level,(i.e. the cyclotron degrees of freedom are\nconfined to the LLL), the kinetic degrees of freedom of\nthe vortices are frozen, since the spacing between Landau\nlevels, h\u0304\u03c9eff , is large compared with all other energies in\nthe problem. The remaining degrees of freedom are the\nl2\nvortex guiding-center coordinates, R = 2r + h\u03040 (p \u00d7 \u1e91).\nThe guiding center coordinate R specify the center of\na Gaussian-localized probability amplitude of width l0 .\nThese coordinates have no kinetic energy. Hence the\nvortices in the LLL will remain localized about a given\nguiding center coordinate R indefinitely.\n\ncore and m0 is the mass of a superfluid particle. The\nabove potential is valid only when the distances between\ntwo vortices is greater than the coherence length. Notice that the interaction strength between two vortices\ndepends on the superfluid density as well as the s-wave\nscattering length a.\nThe Hamiltonian of a rotating BEC containing vortices\ncan be written in terms of center of vortices (collective\ncoordinate) as [6]\n\nIII.

(19)\ndt\ndt\n\nThis action is linear in time derivatives and hence discontinuous paths have finite action. It implies that the\ncoherent state path integral is dominated by discontinuous paths and the limits is ill defined. Despite these\ndifficulties, the continuum version of the path integral\ncan be used to develop a saddle-point approximation for\nthe partition function [8]. We are interested in the semiclassical limit when V (R) is a slowly varying function of\nits argument over the length scale l0 and we can use the\nsaddle point approximation to evaluate the path integral.\nThe single vortex path integral can be generalized to\nmany vortex path integral directly.

If we consider a rigid\nWigner solid and allow one ring of vortices to tunnel\ncoherently they see a periodic potential with the periodicity of the lattice (Fig 1). If we observe the coherent\nmotion of one chain over a long time compared to the\ntunneling time (\u03c40 ), the potential that it sees will not\nbe periodic. The physically important rings being onedimensional and long, this can result in the destruction of\nthe long-range order along the chain rather easily. This\nin turn will feed back and affect the rest of the neighborhood, resulting possibly in a molten state. This will\nalso result in the path of the wave packets of vortices\nbeing displaced away from the edges of the triangle of\nthe lattice. This means that the self-consistent potential\nseen by a vortex no longer has a component which has\nlong-range order.\n\nj<k\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\nV (R) = h\u03c6R (r)|V (r)|\u03c6R (r)i\n\n(21)\n\nis two-body interaction potential in coherent states representation.\nIn the saddle point-approximation, the classical path\n|R=Rc = 0.\nis obtained by minimizing the action, \u03b4R\u03b4S\nj (\u03c4 )\nThe classical paths satisfy the following equations of motion\nX\nl2\n\u1e58j = 0 (\u2207j Vj ) \u00d7 \u1e91, where Vj =\nV (Rj \u2212 Rk ). (22)\nh\u0304\nk6=j\n\nThe path integral can be expressed as a sum over saddle point contribution in which the contribution of paths\nin the neighborhood of each classical path is evaluated by\nexpanding the action to quadratic order in R \u2212 Rc . The\npartition function Z is calculated within the semiclassical\napproximation. The partition function can be expressed\nas a sum over P\nclassical paths, assuming the vortices to be\nbosons, Z = c D[Rc ]e\u2212S[Rc ] , where D[Rc ] is the fluctuation determinant and S[Rc ] is the action evaluated\nalong the classical path. There are interesting issues [14]\nabout the statistics of vortices in a compressible superfluid such as ours, and in the present paper we assume\nthem to be bosons. The partition function Z can be written by considering\nonly the leading order contribution as\nP\n[8] Z = Z0 c D\u0303[Rc ]e\u2212S0 [Rc ] , where S = S0 + S\u0303. Let us\nconsider the contribution of a single large exchange ring\nto Z. The real part of the action would be \u03b10 L (see the\nsec. V), where L is the number of vortices in the ring\nand \u03b10 is independent of path. The fluctuation determinant [8] is D\u0303[Rc ] \u223c exp[\u2212\u03b4\u03b1L + O(ln L)]. Here, \u03b4\u03b1\nis a real constant which renormalize \u03b10 . The imaginary\npart, the phase\nchange as a cooperative motion along a\nH\nring is \u03b8 = eAeff .dl = 2\u03c0N , where N is the number of\nthe superfluid particles enclosed by the ring [14]. This\nis the analog of the Bohm-Aharanov phase factor for a\ncharged particle moving in a magnetic field. So the partition function becomes, Z \u223c exp[\u2212\u03b1L \u00b1 i2\u03c0N ], where\n\u03b1 = \u03b10 + \u03b4\u03b1.\n\nFIG. 1.

S\u03bb counts the number of\nclockwise minus counterclockwise ring exchanges that\nsurround a plaquette \u03bb. The function \u03b10 (\u03bdv ) is a measure of the tunneling barrier. The function h(\u03bdv ) is the\nphase factor which arises as a result of the pseudo magnetic flux enclosed by the exchange rings. This model is\nknown to have a phase transition [15] at a critical value\nof \u03b1 = \u03b1c (\u03bdv ) \u223c 1.1 [8]. For \u03b1(\u03bdv ) > \u03b1c (\u03bdv ), the ground\nstate is a vortex Wigner crystal and for \u03b1(\u03bdv ) < \u03b1c (\u03bdv ),\nthe ground state is a quantum mechanical vortex liquid\nstate. In our calculation we find that the quantum melting will occur at \u03bdv \u223c 21 . The current experiments [1,2]\nwith \u03bdv \u226a 21 are in the regimes of vortex lattice ground\nstate. So our result is consistent with the experimental\nresults, but it does not match very well with the other\ntheoretical results [9,10]. The numerical calculation is\nbased on the small number of atomic bosons as well as\nsmall number of vortices. In our approach we assumed a\nlarge number of atomic bosons and vortices. We believe\nthat this discrepancies is related to the system size. One\nwould say that a large system has been considered in the\nref. [10] and calculated the melting condition which is\ncomparable to the numerical result [9]. In the ref. [10],\nfirst they have calculated the root mean square of the\ndisplacement from the equilibrium position of a vortex\nin terms of the filling factor \u03bdv . Then they have used\nthe Lindemenn criterion and assumed that the melting\nwill occur when the fluctuation of the vortex position is\n0.15d to get the melting condition which is close to the\nnumerical result [9]. Although the Lindemann criterion\ngives a reasonable description of the melting of a classical\nsolid, there is little evidence that it can be applied to the\nmelting of a vortex lattice. The vortices are intrinsically\nquantum objects whose equation of motion are quite different from those of atoms in a harmonic crystal.\n\nX i\nQy 2\n[ \u1e8aj Yj +\nY\n2\n2 j\nj\n\n+\n\n1\nSeff = \u221a\n3\u03c0\u03bdv\n\nevaluate the fluctuation determinant we have to take the\ncontinuum limit of the effective action Seff .

This is an infrared divergence and\nthe continuum model must be constructed by taking the\nupper cut-off limit carefully.

[8] has given an extensive discussion of\nhow to map Wigner crystal of electrons in a magnetic\nfield into the discrete Gaussian model. Following the ref.\n[8], one can map the sum over all classical paths to a\nsun over classical spin configurations. All the contributions of ring exchanges happening in a time interval \u03c40\nare summed by modeling the change in the action by a\ndiscrete Gaussian model in an imaginary field [15],\nX\nX\nHDG = \u03b10 (\u03bdv )\n(S\u03bb \u2212 S\u03b3 )2 + ih(\u03bdv )\nS\u03bb , (26)\n\nThe \u03b10 is independent of K \u2032 s.

SUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we treated the vortices as a new degrees of freedom and considered a model Hamiltonian\nof interacting vortices. Later, we assumed the vortices\nare in the lowest Landau level due to the low mass of\nthe vortices and the high densities of the superfluid Bose\nparticles. The concept of cooperative ring exchange is\nintroduced to explain the mechanism of quantum melting of the Wigner crystals. Finally, we estimated the\ntunneling coefficient which determines the condition for\nquantum melting instability of the vortex lattices. Latest experiments [1] with N \u223c 105 , Nv \u223c 10 (\u03bdv \u223c 10\u22124 )\nand [2] with N \u223c 107 , Nv \u223c 100 (\u03bdv \u223c 10\u22125 ) are in the\nregime in which the ground state is a vortex lattice. It\nis a challenge for experimentalists to produce a vortex\nliquid state in a rotating Bose condensed state.\nOur present work, resulting in a discrete Gaussian\nmodel (equation 10) predicts Laughlin like even denominator bosonic vortex filling fraction \u03bdv = 21 , to emerge on\nquantum melting. We can also determine the asymptotic\nform of the wave functions [16]. Along with a rich phase\nstructure the discrete Gaussian model also determines\nthe nature of the quantum melting transition. To the extent the vortex degrees of freedom retain their identity,\nthe results of CRE approach may remain valid in the\nquantum melted region. This needs to be investigated\nfurther.\nAs mentioned earlier CRE processes should leave its\nfinger print as specific fluctuation patterns (figure 1) that\npreempts quantum melting. It should be interesting to\nlook for snapshots of such displaced large rings in the\nactual vortex lattice imaging.\n\n\u2206E2 =\n\ni\u2208L,|\u2208L\n/\n\n[V (Ti + d \u2212 Tj ) \u2212 V (Ti \u2212 Tj )] .

The\nthird and final term is that arising from both i and j on\nthe line. Since the tunneling is cooperative, this contribution to the classical action vanishes.\nBy allowing one line of vortices to tunnel coherently\nalong the line, one can fit the change in energy \u2206E into\na periodic potential with the appropriate choice of the\nparameter Qx . On the other hand, by allowing one line\nof vortices to tunnel coherently perpendicular to the line,\none can fit the change in energy into a quadratic potential\nwith appropriate choice of the parameter Qy .\n\n[1] K.
