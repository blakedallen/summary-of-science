Several candidates have been suggested\nfor explaining this component, as, for example, minimally coupled scalar fields (see e.q. [2] and references therein).\nHowever, it may also be that the cosmological evidence for acceleration comes from the wrong assumption of general\nrelativity, i.e. that no dark component is present but actually a modification to gravity is at work. In this respect,\nf (R) theories seem to provide a quite large number of viable models (for a recent review see [3] and [4]). A particular\nf (R) model that evades solar system test has been proposed by Hu and Sawicki ([5], HS hereafter). The model has a\nmodified Einstein-Hilbert action:\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u0003\n\u221a \u0002 R + f (R)\nd4 x \u2212g\n+ Lm\n2k 2\n\n(1)\n\nLm is the matter lagrangian, k 2 = 8\u03c0G and\n\nf (R) = \u2212m\n\n2\n\nc1\n1+\n\n\u0001\nR n\nm2\n\u0001n\nc2 mR2\n\n(2)\n\nwith m2 = k 2 \u03c1/3 and c1 , c2 and n as free parameters.\nAs shown in [5] this model is able to reproduce the late time accelerated universe but with distinctive deviations\nfrom a cosmological constant. In this paper we investigate the cosmological viability of the HS model in more detail.\nAfter a brief description of the model, in the next section we will show that the HS model satisfies indeed the general\nconditions presented by [6] as a viable f (R) model. In Sec. III we compare the HS model with current data from SN-Ia\nluminosity distances from the UNION catalog ([8]), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data ([11]) and age constraints from\nthe analysis of Simon, Verde and Jimenez ([9]). We show that the current data is fully compatible with the HS model\nand that, unless a prior on the matter density is used, the parameters of the model are unconstrained. In particular,\nwe analyze the impact of the HS model in the determination of the current matter density. As we will show, assuming\nthe HS model instead of the standard cosmological model, could relax the constraints on the effective matter density.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: matteo.martinelli@roma1.infn.it\naddress: alessandro.melchiorri@roma1.infn.it\n\u2021 Electronic address: amendola@mporzio.it\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\nA future incompatibility between the values of the matter density \u03a9M determined from different datasets and under\nthe assumption of the standard \u039bCDM model could therefore provide an hint for a modified gravity scenario.\nII.\n\nTHE HU-SAWICKY MODEL\n\nLet us briefly review in this section the basic equations and results of the HS model. Varying the action in Eq. 1\nwith respect to the metric g \u03bc\u03bd one obtains the modified Einstein equations:\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd + fR R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u0001\nf\n\u2212 \u0003fR g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd fR = k 2 T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere fR = df /dR and fRR = d2 f /dR2 and assuming a flat FRW metric, the modified Friedmann equation:\nH 2 \u2212 fR (HH \u2032 + H 2 ) +\n\nf\nk2 \u03c1\n+ H 2 fRR R\u2032 =\n6\n3\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u2032 \u2261 d/dlna and \u03c1 the matter density at present time.\nDefining the new variables yH = (H 2 /m2 ) \u2212 a\u22123 and yR = (R/m2 ) \u2212 3a\u22123 the Friedmann equations can be expanded\nin a system of two ordinary differential equations:\n\u2032\n=\nyH\n\n\u2032\nyR\n= 9a\u22123 \u2212\n\nyR\n\u2212 4yH\n3\n\nf \u0003\n1\n1 \u0002\na\u22123 \u0001\nyR\n+\n\u2212\ny\n\u2212\ny\n\u2212\nf\nH\nH\nR\n\u22123\n2\nyH + a m fRR\n6\n2\n6m2\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nIn order to compare the HS model with the cosmological constraints usually derived under the assumption of dark\nenergy, it is useful to introduce an effective dark energy component with present energy density \u03a9\u0303x = 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u0303m and\nequation of state wx , where \u03a9\u0303m is the effective matter energy density at present time.\nOf course, in reality no dark energy component is present, the only component present is matter and modified gravity\ngives the acceleration. Considering the Friedmann equation:\nR1\n3[1+wx (a)]\nH2\n\u03a9\u0303m\na\n= 3 + \u03a9\u0303x e a da\n2\nH0\na\n\n(7)\n\nthe effective equation of state parameter wx for the dark energy component is given by\n\nwx = \u22121 \u2212\n\n\u2032\n1 yH\n3 yH\n\n(8)\n\nThe free parameters c1 and c2 that appear in Eq. 2 can be expressed in function of the effective density parameters\nby:\n\u03a9\u0303x\nc1\n\u22486\nc2\n\u03a9\u0303m\n\n(9)\n\n\u0001n+1\nc1\nfR 12\n=\u2212 0\n\u22129\nc22\nn \u03a9\u0303m\n\n(10)\n\nThese relations show that the free parameters of the model are \u03a9\u0303m , n, and fR0 . The latter is constrained to\n|fR0 | . 0.1 by solar system tests [5] and we will not investigate larger values in the next sections.\nSolving the differential equations system for different values of n, fR0 and \u03a9\u0303m , it is possible to obtain various\nevolution trends for the equation of state parameter wx . In Fig.1 and Fig.2 we plot the behavior of wx in function of\n\n\f3\n\n-0.80\n\n-0.85\n\n-0.90\n\nw(z)\n\n-0.95\n\n-1.00\n\n-1.05\n\n-1.10\n\n-1.15\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nz\nFIG. 1: The equation of state parameter wx for n = 1 and fR0 equal to \u22120.1 (solid line), \u22120.03 (dashed line) e \u22120.01 (dotted\nline). \u03a9\u0303m is set to 0.24\n\nthe redshift z for different values of fR0 and n.\nAs we can see in Fig.1 and Fig.2 the equation of state parameter wx follows a peculiar behavior in function of the\nredshift. At the present time (z = 0) wx has always a value higher than the one predicted by the \u039bCDM model\n(w = \u22121) and, moving towards higher redshifts, it decreases crossing into the phantom region, i.e., assuming values\nlower than \u22121. For even higher redshifts, wx moves asymptotically towards \u22121.\nThe same behavior is shown for any value of n and fR0 , moreover decreasing the absolute value of fR0 brings wx\ncloser to \u22121, while increasing n shifts the phantom crossing at lower redshift.\n\n-0.85\n\n-0.90\n\nw(z)\n\n-0.95\n\n-1.00\n\n-1.05\n\n-1.10\n\n-1.15\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nz\nFIG. 2: The equation of state parameter wx for n = 2 and fR0 equal to \u22120.1 (solid line), \u22120.03 (dashed line) e \u22120.01 (dotted\nline). \u03a9\u0303m is set to 0.24\n\nThe modification of the Einstein-Hilbert lagrangian brings to a new equation for the expansion of the Universe.\n\n\f4\nThe predicted expansion must be consistent with standard cosmological results, i.e., should produce an accelerated\nera after radiation and matter dominance.\nModified gravity models consistent with current observations, for example, should not change the scale factor evolution\nduring the matter era. Hence, it is possible to derive general conditions for the cosmological viability of f (R) theories.\nIntroducing the parameters\n\nm(r) =\n\nRfRR\n1 + fR\n\nr=\u2212\n\nR(1 + fR )\nR+f\n\n(11)\n\nit is possible to show [6] that for f (R) theories the following conditions apply:\n\u2022 The model has a standard matter era with a following accelerated phase if\nm(r) \u2248 0 and m\u2032 (r) > \u22121 with r \u2248 \u22121\n\n(12)\n\n\u2022 The accelerated phase goes asymptotically towards the one produced by a dark energy with equation of state\nparameter w = \u22121, if\n0 \u2264 m(r) \u2264 1 f or r = \u22122\n\n(13)\n\n\u2022 The expansion is not of the phantom type (w < \u22121) if\nm(r) = \u22121 \u2212 r\n\n(14)\n\n10.0\n7.5\n5.0\n\nm(r)\n\n2.5\n0.0\n-2.5\n-5.0\n-7.5\n-10.0\n-12.5\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nr\n\nFIG. 3: Plot of the two solution for m(r) obtained setting n = 1, \u03a9\u0303m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u0303\u039b = 0.7. The solid line corresponds to the\nviable solution while the dashed line lies outside the viability region. The red line shows the solution m(r) = \u2212r \u2212 1.\n\nIt is possible to calculate m(r) for the Hu and Sawicki model and to show the cosmological viability of this model.\nIn Fig.3 we show that, for example, setting n = 1, \u03a9\u0303m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u0303\u039b = 0.7, one obtains two solutions for m(r), one\nliving outside the viability region and the other corresponding to an acceptable expansion.\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nCONSTRAINTS ON THE HS MODEL\nA.\n\nMethod\n\nIn order to constrain the free parameters of the Hu and Sawicki model (\u03a9\u0303m , n and fR0 ), we predicted the expected\ntheoretical values for a set of observables.\nAs now common in the literature, we considered the luminosity distance, defined by:\n1\ndL (a) =\na\n\nZ\n\n1\n\na\n\n1\nda\n=\n2\na H(a)\naH0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\na\n\nda\nq\na2 \u03a9\u0303m (yH + a\u22123 )\n\n(15)\n\nand the Hubble parameter:\nq\nH(a) = \u03a9\u0303m H02 (yH + a\u22123 )\n\n(16)\n\nMoreover, we also considered the quantity:\np\n\u03a9\u0303m \u0002 \u03932 (z\u2217 ) \u0003 31\nA\u2261\nz\u2217\nz\u2217\n\u01eb(z\u2217 )\n\n(17)\n\nRz\nwhere z\u2217 = 0.35, \u0393(z\u2217 ) = 0 \u2217 dz/\u01eb(z) and \u01eb(z) = H(z)/H0 . The value of this parameter can be obtained from\nobservations of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) [7]. Hence, we have another way to compare model prediction\nwith data.\nWe used the superovae data from Kowalski et al.

[11].\nWe compute a \u03c72 variable for each observational quantity and then combine the results in a single variable \u03c72 =\n+ \u03c72BAO + \u03c72H + \u03c72HST . Once the theoretical evolution of the observational quantities is defined, we can define a\nlikelihood function as a function of n and fR0 as\n\u03c72SN\n\nL = e\u2212\n\n\u03c72 \u2212\u03c72\nmin\n2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c72min is the minimum value in the considered range of n and fR0 .\n\nB.\n\nResults\n\nCombining the results obtained from the comparison between the experimental data for H(z), A and dL (z) and\ntheir theoretical values, we can constrain the free parameters n and fR0 for different values of \u03a9\u0303m and \u03a9\u0303x .\nSetting \u03a9\u0303m = 0.2 and \u03a9\u0303x = 0.8 it is possible to find an upper limit on n and on fR0 , n < 1.6 and fR0 < \u22120.03 at\n2 \u03c3, while, performing the same analysis with different values of \u03a9\u0303m and \u03a9\u0303\u039b , we can see that raising \u03a9\u0303m brings to\nmore loosely constrained parameters.\nWe can note anyway that for higher values of \u03a9\u0303m , higher n are preferred, while smaller values of n are more in\nagreement with data for smaller \u03a9\u0303m .\nAs we can see from Figure 4, for \u03a9\u0303m = 0.3 both parameters are almost totally unconstrained; this points out the need\nof an independent measurement of the effective matter content (\u03a9\u0303m ) in order to obtain some constraints on n and fR0 .\n\n\f6\n\n=0.20\n\n=0.25\n\nM\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.05\n\nfR0\n\nfR0\n\nM\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.07\n\n-0.07\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.09\n\n-0.09\n\n-0.10\n\n-0.10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n6\n\n=0.30\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n=0.35\n\nM\n\nM\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.05\n\nfR0\n\nfR0\n\n8\n\nn\n\nn\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.07\n\n-0.07\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.09\n\n-0.09\n\n-0.10\n\n-0.10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nn\n\nn\n\nFIG. 4: 68%, 95% and 99% confidence levels in the n-fR0 plane in function of different values of \u03a9\u0303m .\n\nIt is interesting to compare the best fit values of \u03c72 obtained in the modified gravity framework with the \u03c72 of a\ncosmological constant model. In order to quantify the goodness-of-fit of the two models we use the Akaike information\ncriterion (AIC) [12] and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [13], defined as\nAIC = \u22122 ln L + 2k\nBIC = \u22122 ln L + k ln N\nwhere L is the maximum likelihood, k the number of parameters and N the number of points.\n\n780\n780\n760\n760\n740\n740\n720\n\nBIC\n\nAIC\n\n720\n700\n\n700\n680\n680\n660\n660\n640\n640\n0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45\n\nM\n\n0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45\n\nM\n\nFIG. 5: AIC (left panel) and BIC (right panel) tests in function of \u03a9m for the standard case of a cosmological constant (dashed\nline) and for the HS model (solid line).\n\nIn Fig. 5 we plot the best fit values of the AIC and BIC tests in function of \u03a9\u0303m for the standard model based\non a cosmological constant and the HS model respectively. As we can see, while the cosmological constant gives\nslightly better values for the overall best fit, when larger or smaller values of \u03a9\u0303m are considered the AIC and BIC\n\n\f7\ntests provide definitly better values for the HS model. In few words, there is a weaker dependence of the observables\nconsidered from \u03a9\u0303m in the case of HS scenario.\n\nSn+H+H\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nLikelihood\n\nLikelihood\n\nSn+BAO\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nSn+BAO+H+H\n\nM\n\n0.30\n\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\nM\n\n0\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\nLikelihood\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\nM\n\nFIG. 6: The likelihood function L(\u03a9\u0303m ) for the Hu and Sawicki model (thicker lines) and \u039bCDM model (fainter lines).\n\nIt is therefore important to quantify the impact of a different choice of the theoretical background model on the\nderived constraints on \u03a9\u0303m . In Fig. 6 we compare the constraints on the \u03a9\u0303m parameter derived under the assumption\nof the HS scenario with the similar constraints but assuming general relativity and dark energy. As we can see\nthe \u03a9\u0303m parameter is less constrained respect to the \u039bCDM scenario. This is certainly due to the larger amount of\nparameters present in the HS model. In the future, with the increasing experimental accuracy, if a discrepancy between\nindependent constraints on the matter density will be found then a modified gravity scenario could be suggested as\npossible explanation. This result anyway shows that one should also be extremely careful in considering the current\ncosmological constraints because of their model dependence.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have compared a modified gravity scenario, the HS model, with several current cosmological\ndatasets. We have found that the model is in excellent agreement with recent SN-Ia, BAO and H(z) data. Moreover,\nthe parameters of the model are substantially unconstrained by the data considered. This has important effect on\nthe current constraints on some parameters as the matter density. We have shown that the assumption of the HS\nmodel enlarges the current constraints on this parameter by \u223c 30%. If a discrepancy between two experimental\ndeterminations of the matter density will be found in the framework of general relativity, then a possible solution\ncould be the introduction of a modified gravity scenario. It will be duty of future experiments to scrutinize this\ninteresting possibility.\n\n\f8\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research has been supported by ASI contract I/016/07/0 \"COFIS.\"\n\n[1] E.
