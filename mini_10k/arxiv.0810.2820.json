Generic existence criteria are examined in the context of the Lax entropy conditions. Our\nanalysis naturally precludes traveling wave solutions for which the\nshocks travel downstream more rapidly than individual vehicles. Consistent with recent experimental observations from a periodic roadway\n(Sugiyama et al.

Jamitons are characterized by a sharp increase in density over a relatively compact section\nof the roadway. Applications of our analysis to traffic modeling and\ncontrol are examined by way of a detailed example.\nPACS: 89.40.Bb Land transportation; 47.10.ab Conservation laws;\n47.40.Rs Detonation\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and problem formulation\n\nThe economic costs in terms of lost productivity, atmospheric pollution and\nvehicular collisions associated with traffic jams are substantial both in developed and developing nations. As such, the discipline of traffic science has\n1\n\n\fexpanded significantly in recent decades, particularly from the point of view\nof theoretical modeling [1]. Borrowing terminology applied in Payne [2] and\nelsewhere, three generic categories describe the approaches considered in\nmost previous analyses. \"Microscopic\" models, such as \"follow the leader\"\nstudies [3] or \"optimal velocity\" studies [4] consider the individual (i.e. Lagrangian) response of a driver to his or her neighbors, in particular, the\nvehicle immediately ahead. \"Mesoscopic\" or \"gas-kinetic macroscopic\" analyses, such as the examinations of Phillips [5] and Helbing [6] take a statistical\nmechanics approach in which vehicle interactions are modeled using ideas\nfamiliar from kinetic theory. Finally \"macroscopic\" studies [2, 7\u201312] model\ntraffic flow using conservation laws and a suitable adaptation of the methods\nof continuum mechanics [13,14], which yields governing equations similar to\nthose from fluid mechanics. It is this latter category of analysis that is of\ninterest here.\nTreating the traffic flow as a continuum, we begin by considering a one\ndimensional Payne-Whitham model with periodic boundary conditions, i.e.\nvehicles on a circular track of length 0 < \u03bb < \u221e [15]. The governing\nequations for mass and momentum are then (e.g. Kerner & Konh\u00e4user [10])\n\u03c1t + (\u03c1 u)x = 0,\n(1.1)\n1\n1\nut + u ux + px =\n(\u0169 \u2212 u) ,\n(1.2)\n\u03c1\n\u03c4\nwhere the subscripts indicate differentiation, \u03c4 is a relaxation time-scale, u is\nthe traffic speed, and \u03c1 is the traffic density - with units of vehicles/length.\nThe traffic pressure, p, which incorporates the effects of the \"preventive\"\ndriving needed to compensate for the time delay \u03c4 , is typically assumed\nto be an increasing function of the density only, i.e. p = p(\u03c1) [11]. Here,\nin order to have a well-behaved theoretical formulation in the presence of\nshock waves [16], we shall assume that p is a convex function of the specific\nvolume v = 1/\u03c1 (road length per vehicle). This implies that dp/dv < 0\nand d2 p/dv2 > 0, which holds for the functions typically assigned to p in\nmacroscopic models. Finally, \u0169 = \u0169(\u03c1) gives, for a particular traffic density,\nthe desired or equilibrium speed to which the drivers try to adjust. The\nprecise functional form of \u0169 is, to a certain degree, rather arbitrary and\nindeed several variants have been proposed [1]. Generally, \u0169 is a decreasing\none-to-one function of the density, with 0 < \u0169(0) = \u01690 < \u221e and \u0169(\u03c1M ) = 0,\nwhere:\n\u2022 \u03c1M denotes the maximum density, at which the vehicles are nearly\n\"bumper-to-bumper\" - thus ` = \u03c1\u22121\nM is the \"effective\" (uniform) vehicle length.\n2\n\n\f\u2022 \u01690 is the drivers' desired speed of travel on an otherwise empty road.\n\nIn this paper, we restrict ourselves to the representative form \u0169 = \u01690 (1 \u2212\n\u03c1/\u03c1M )n , where n is \"close\" to 1. We defer the detailed treatment of the\nexact conditions on \u0169 that guarantee the existence of self-sustained nonlinear\ntraveling waves in traffic (termed \"jamitons\" herein) to a later publication.\nUbiquitous attributes of the solutions to continuum traffic models are\nstable shock-like features (see e.g. Kerner & Konh\u00e4user [9] and Aw & Rascle [11]). In analyzing such structures, a dissipative term proportional to\nuxx , analogous to the viscous term in the Navier-Stokes equations, is often\nadded to the right-hand side of the momentum equation (1.2) in order to\n\"smear out\" discontinuities [1]. However, the physical rationale for this term\nis ambiguous and the proper functional form is therefore subject to debate.\nSolutions, such as those obtained by Kerner & Konh\u00e4user [9], whose dynamics are non-trivially influenced by viscous dissipation must therefore be\ninterpreted with care. Herein, an alternative line of inquiry is proposed: we\nseek self-sustained traveling wave solutions to the \"inviscid\" equations (1.1\n\u2013 1.2) on a periodic domain, where shocks are modeled by discontinuities, as\nin the standard theory of shocks for hyperbolic conservations laws [16]. As\nwe demonstrate below, not only do such nonlinear traveling waves exist, but\nthey have a structure similar to that of the self-sustained detonation waves\nin the Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering (ZND) theory [17]. According to\nthe ZND description, detonation waves are modeled as shock waves with an\nattached exothermic reaction zone. In a self-sustained detonation wave, the\nflow downstream of the shock is subsonic relative to the shock, but accelerating to become sonic at some distance away from the shock. Hence, the\nflow behind a self-sustained detonation wave can be \"transonic,\" i.e. it may\nundergo a transition from subsonic to supersonic. The existence of the sonic\npoint, the location where the flow speed relative to the shock equals the local\nsound speed, is the key feature in the ZND theory that allows one to solve\nfor the speed and structure of the detonation wave. Its existence also means\nthat the shock wave cannot be influenced by smooth disturbances from the\nflow further downstream so that the shock wave becomes self-sustained and\nindependent of external driving mechanisms. Hence the sonic point is an\n\"acoustic\" information or event horizon [18].\nFor the nonlinear traffic waves to be discussed herein, this means that\ntheir formation, due to small initial perturbations, is analogous to the ignition and detonation that can occur in a meta-stable explosive medium.\nAlthough this analogy has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the\ntraffic literature, the physical and mathematical similarities between deto3\n\n\fnation waves and hydraulic jumps, described by equations similar to (1.1)\nand (1.2), were recently pointed out by Kasimov [19]. (The analogy between\nhydraulic jumps and inert gas-dynamic shocks was recognized much earlier\n\u2013 see e.g. Gilmore et al. [20] and Stoker [21].) As with Kasimov's analysis,\nour aim is to herein exploit such commonalities to gain additional understanding into the dynamics of traffic flows, in particular, the traffic jams\nthat appear in the absence of bottlenecks and for no apparent reason. From\nthis vantage point, novel insights are discerned over and above those that\ncan be realized from the solution of a Riemann problem [11] or from the linear stability analysis of uniform base states (see e.g. Appendix C). Indeed,\nwhen such linear instabilities are present initially, our extensive numerical\nexperiments suggest that the resulting \"phantom jams\" (see Helbing [1] and\nthe many references therein) will ultimately saturate as jamitons. This observation provides a critical link between the initial and final states, the\nlatter of which can, under select conditions (see e.g. \u00a7 5.3), be described\nanalytically. Moreover, as we plan to illustrate in forthcoming publications,\nsuch self-sustained traffic shocks are also expected on non-periodic roads.\nThus the model results presented below can be readily generalized beyond\nthe mathematically convenient case of a closed circuit.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: in \u00a7 2, we outline the\nbasic requirements for (1.1) and (1.2) to exhibit traveling wave solutions. To\ndemonstrate the generality of this analysis, we consider in \u00a7 3 modified forms\nfor the momentum equation (developed by Aw & Rascle [11] and Helbing\n[12]). From this different starting point, the salient details of \u00a7 2 shall be\nreproduced. The analysis is further generalized in \u00a7 4, which considers a\nphase plane investigation of the governing equations from \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 3. A\nparticular example is studied, both theoretically and numerically, in \u00a7 5 in\nwhich \u0169 and p are assigned particular functional forms. The impact of our\nfindings on safe roadway design is briefly discussed. Conclusions are drawn\nin \u00a7 6.\n\n2\n\nTraveling wave solutions \u2013 jamitons\n\nTo determine periodic traveling wave solutions to the traffic flow equations\n(1.1) and (1.2), we begin by making the solution ansatz, \u03c1 = \u03c1 (\u03b7) and\nu = u (\u03b7), where the self-similar variable \u03b7 is defined by\n\u03b7=\n\nx \u2212 st\n.\n\u03c4\n\n4\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fHere s is the speed, either positive or negative, of the traveling wave. Equation (1.1) then reduces to\n{\u03c1 (u \u2212 s)}\u03b7 = 0,\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03c1=\n\nm\n,\nu\u2212s\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere the constant m denotes the mass flux of vehicles in the wave frame\nof reference. Substituting (2.2) into (1.2), we obtain\ndu\n(u \u2212 s) (\u0169 \u2212 u)\n,\n=\nd\u03b7\n(u \u2212 s)2 \u2212 c2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere we interpret \u0169 = \u0169(\u03c1) as a function of u via (2.2). Here c = (p\u03c1 )1/2 > 0\nis the \"sound speed,\" i.e. the speed at which infinitesimal perturbations move\nrelative to the traffic flow.\nEquation (2.3) is a first order ordinary differential equation and therefore, barring pathological and unphysical choices for c and \u0169, does not admit\nany smooth periodic solutions. Hence, the periodic traveling wave(s) - if\nthey exist - must consist of monotone solutions to (2.3) that are connected\nby shocks. The simplest situation, as reproduced in the physical experiment\nof Sugiyama et al. [15], is one in which there is exactly one shock (with speed\ns) per period. The case of multiple shocks per period is more complex. We\nbriefly address this situation in \u00a7 5.3.\nBefore going into the details of the solution, we recall that shocks must\nsatisfy two sets of conditions to be admissible. First, they must satisfy the\nRankine-Hugoniot conditions [11,13,14], which follow from the conservation\nof mass and momentum, and ensure that shocks do not become sources\nor sinks of mass and/or momentum. For the equations in (1.1 \u2013 1.2), the\nRankine-Hugoniot conditions take the form,\ns [\u03c1] = [\u03c1u]\ns [\u03c1u] = [p +\n\n\u03c1u2 ]\n\n(i.e. conservation of mass),\n\n(2.4)\n\n(i.e. conservation of momentum),\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere s is the shock speed and the brackets [ ] indicate the jump in the\nenclosed variable across the shock discontinuity. These equations relate the\nupstream and downstream conditions at the shock. In particular, let the\nsuperscripts + and \u2212 denote the states immediately downstream (right)\nand upstream (left) of the shock, respectively. Then (2.4) is equivalent to\n\u03c1+ (u+ \u2212 s) = m = \u03c1\u2212 (u\u2212 \u2212 s),\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere the constant m is the mass flux across the shock. Of course, for a\nshock embedded within a jamiton, this m is the same as the one in (2.2).\n5\n\n\fFigure 1: Characteristics on both sides of a left (a) and right (b) shock in\nthe frame of the shock. The flow direction is from left-to-right in (a) and\nright-to-left in (b). The equations of the characteristics are C\u00b1 : d\u03b7/dt =\n(u \u2212 s \u00b1 c)/\u03c4 , where \u03b7 is defined by (2.1), and s is the shock speed.\nSecond, shocks must satisfy the Lax \"entropy\" conditions [14,16], which\nenforce dynamical stability. In the case of shocks in gas-dynamics, these\nconditions are equivalent to the statement that the entropy of a fluid parcel\nincreases as it goes through the shock transition - hence the name. However, the existence of a physical entropy is not necessary for their formulation: stability considerations alone suffice. Furthermore, these conditions\nalso guarantee that the shock evolution is causal.\nFor the particular system of equations in (1.1 \u2013 1.2), the Lax entropy\nconditions - given below in (2.7 \u2013 2.8) - state that one family of characteristics1 must converge into the shock path in space-time, while the other\nfamily must pass through it. Thus exactly two families of shocks are possible, as illustrated in figure 1: The left (respectively right) shocks have the\nleft (respectively right) characteristics converging upon them.\nIn the context of the periodic traveling waves with a single shock per\nperiod, the above discussion implies that, in principle, two cases are possible:\njamitons containing a left shock wherein the mass flux, m, is positive \u2013 see\nitem 1 below, and jamitons containing a right shock wherein the mass flux,\nm, is negative \u2013 see item 2 below. However, as we argue after item 2,\nonly jamitons with m > 0 are mathematically consistent; self-sustained\ntraveling waves carrying within them a right shock are not permitted. This\nis consistent with the experiment of Sugiyama et al. [15], as well as with\none's everyday driving experience: it is situations where individual vehicles\novertake shocks (hence m > 0) that are observed in reality, rather than the\nconverse. Thus whereas in second order traffic models information in the\nform of shock waves can travel downstream faster than individual vehicles\n[22], the results in this paper show that this cannot happen in the form of\n1\nThe curves in space-time along which infinitesimal perturbations propagate. Namely:\ndx/dt = u + c (\"right\" characteristics), and dx/dt = u \u2212 c (\"left\" characteristics).\n\n6\n\n\fa self-sustained traveling wave. Further to the analysis of Aw & Rascle [11]\nand Helbing [12], this observation lends additional support to the conclusion\nthat second order models are not ipso facto flawed - see also Helbing [1],\n\u00a7 III.D.7 and the references therein.\nLet us now consider in some detail the two scenarios that can, in principle, arise for traveling waves with a single shock per period.\n1. The shock is the left shock, as in figure 1 a, so that\n(u \u2212 c)\u2212 > s > (u \u2212 c)+ .\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn this case the mass flux must be positive, since m = \u03c1\u2212 (u\u2212 \u2212 s) >\n\u03c1\u2212 c\u2212 > 0. Moreover, \u03c1+ /\u03c1\u2212 = (u \u2212 s)\u2212 / (u \u2212 s)+ > c\u2212 /c+ , so that\n\u03c1+ c+ > \u03c1\u2212 c\u2212 . The traffic pressure p is a convex function of v = \u03c1\u22121\n(see \u00a7 1), hence \u03c1 c = (\u2212dp/dv)1/2 is an increasing function of the traffic density. Thus \u03c1+ c+ > \u03c1\u2212 c\u2212 implies that \u03c1+ > \u03c1\u2212 . In other words,\nthe shock is compressive: the traffic density increases as the vehicles\npass through the shock, traveling from left to right. Conversely, since\nu = s + m/\u03c1, it follows that u\u2212 > u+ and, consequently, vehicles decelerate as they overtake the shock. It should then be clear that these\nshocks have all the familiar properties of traffic jams.\nWe conclude that for a traveling wave with a left shock, the continuous\nsolution of (2.1 \u2013 2.3) must have a decreasing density, d\u03c1/d\u03b7 < 0, and\nan increasing velocity, du/d\u03b7 > 0. This follows because the solution\nmust be a monotone function of \u03b7, and must connect the post-shock\nstate (\u03c1+ , u+ ) in one shock, to the pre-shock state (\u03c1\u2212 , u\u2212 ) in the\nsubsequent shock across a period in \u03b7 - say from \u03b7 = 0 to \u03b7 = \u03bb.\n2. The shock is the right shock, as in figure 1 b, so that\n(u + c)\u2212 > s > (u + c)+ .\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe mass flux now is negative, since m = \u03c1+ (u \u2212 s)+ < \u2212\u03c1+ c+ <\n0. As in item 1, it is straightforward to show that u\u2212 > u+ and\n\u03c1\u2212 > \u03c1+ . For a traveling wave with a right shock, the continuous\nand monotone solution of (2.1 \u2013 2.3) must have both the density and\nvelocity increasing with \u03b7 (i.e. d\u03c1/d\u03b7 > 0 and du/d\u03b7 > 0), in order\nto connect (\u03c1+ , u+ ) to (\u03c1\u2212 , u\u2212 ) across a period in \u03b7. Notice that the\nshock is again compressive: the traffic density (in the vehicles' frame\nof reference) increases as vehicles pass through the shock. However, in\nthis latter case, the shock overtakes the vehicles from behind, which\naccelerate as they pass through the shock transition. This is a clearly\ncounter-intuitive situation, not observed in real traffic [22].\n7\n\n\fFortunately, as we demonstrate next, traveling wave solutions with m < 0\nare mathematically inconsistent, which obviates the need to consider them\nany further. First, (2.2) is employed to rewrite (2.3) in the form\ndu\n= m \u03c1 G(\u03c1, s, m),\nd\u03b7\nwhere\nG=\n\n\u0169 \u2212 u\n,\n\u2212 \u03c12 c2\n\nm2\n\n(2.9)\n\n(2.10)\n\n\b\nm2 \u2212 \u03c12 c2 = \u03c12 (u \u2212 s)2 \u2212 c2 , and u = s + m/\u03c1. Because du/d\u03b7 > 0, a\nsmooth solution connecting (\u03c1+ , u+ ) to (\u03c1\u2212 , u\u2212 ) requires G < 0. However,\nm2 \u2212 \u03c12 c2 = \u03c1 (u \u2212 s + c) (m \u2212 \u03c1 c) and m \u2212 \u03c1 c < 0, and it follows from (2.8)\nthat (m2 \u2212\u03c12 c2 )+ > 0 > (m2 \u2212\u03c12 c2 )\u2212 . Thus G < 0 requires (\u0169\u2212u)+ < 0 <\n(\u0169 \u2212 u)\u2212 , which is impossible since \u0169(\u03c1) \u2212 u = \u0169(\u03c1) \u2212 s \u2212 m/\u03c1 is a strictly\ndecreasing function of \u03c1: \u0169(\u03c1) decreases with increasing \u03c1 by assumption\nand m < 0.\nThe difficulties documented in the previous paragraph are avoided for\ntraveling waves with m > 0. In this case, we demand a solution of (2.9)\nwith du/d\u03b7 > 0 and d\u03c1/d\u03b7 < 0, connecting (\u03c1+ , u+ ) to (\u03c1\u2212 , u\u2212 ). This\nin turn requires G > 0 for \u03c1\u2212 < \u03c1 < \u03c1+ . The assumptions on p = p(\u03c1)\nimply that m2 \u2212 \u03c12 c2 is a strictly decreasing function of \u03c1 (item 1). Since\nm2 \u2212\u03c12 c2 = \u03c1 (u\u2212s\u2212c) (m+\u03c1 c) with m+\u03c1 c > 0, it follows from (2.7) that\n(m2 \u2212 \u03c12 c2 )\u2212 > 0 > (m2 \u2212 \u03c12 c2 )+ . We conclude therefore that m2 \u2212 \u03c12 c2\nhas a unique, multiplicity one, zero at some \u03c1s , with \u03c1\u2212 < \u03c1s < \u03c1+ . In\norder for (2.9) to have a smooth solution with the desired properties, the\nnumerator \u0169 \u2212 u = \u0169(\u03c1) \u2212 s \u2212 m/\u03c1 must be such that\n\uf8fc\n(a) \u0169 \u2212 u has a simple zero at \u03c1 = \u03c1s ; \uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\u2212\n(b) \u0169 \u2212 u > 0 for \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1 < \u03c1s ;\n(2.11)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n+\n(c) \u0169 \u2212 u < 0 for \u03c1s < \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1 .\nThis then guarantees not only that the zero in the denominator of (2.9 \u2013\n2.10) is cancelled by a zero of the same order in the numerator, but that\nthe resulting regularized ordinary differential equation yields du/d\u03b7 > 0\neverywhere, as needed. Indeed, \u03c1s is the traffic density at the sonic point,\nwith corresponding flow speed us = s + m/\u03c1s .\nFigure 2 illustrates the situation, with plots of u and \u0169 as functions of \u03c1\nand u for representative initial conditions \u03c1+ and u+ . The shock speed, s, is\nhere restricted by the inequalities u+ > s > (u\u2212c)+ . Clearly, the conditions\n8\n\n\f(a) m>0\n\n(b) m>0\n\n\u0169/ \u0169 0, u/ \u0169 0\n\n1\n\n1\n\u0169/ \u0169 0\nu/ \u0169 0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n45o\n\n0\n0\n\n\u03c1 1 /\u03c1 M\n\n\u03c1 2 /\u03c1 M\n\n0.5\n\u03c1/\u03c1 M\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\nu 2 / \u0169 0\nu M / \u0169 0\n\n0.5\nu/\u0169 0\n\nu 1 / \u0169 0\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: Panel (a) shows typical profiles for \u0169/\u01690 (solid curve) and u/\u01690\n(dashed curve) as functions of \u03c1/\u03c1M , where u = s + m/\u03c1. Equivalently,\nthese profiles may be plotted against u/\u01690 by employing the transformation\n(2.2), as shown in panel (b) - the dashed curve is then just a line with\nunit slope. The two curves will either not intersect at all, be tangent at a\nsingle point, or have two transversal intersections. The case of interest to\nus is the one with two transversal intersections, as depicted here: u2 is the\nintersection with a smaller velocity and a larger density \u03c12 = m/(u2 \u2212 s) -\nsolid circles, while the other intersection (open circles) defines u1 and \u03c11 . It\nshould be clear that, in order to satisfy the conditions in (2.11), the sonic\npoint must coincide with (u2 , \u03c12 ). Finally, a physically meaningful solution\nrequires u > 0 everywhere. Hence, u2 > 0 is needed. As shown by panel (b),\nthis condition is equivalent to the statement: when \u0169 = 0, that is \u03c1 = \u03c1M ,\nthe corresponding u = uM = s + m/\u03c1M is positive.\nin (2.11) require that the sonic point values of the density, \u03c1s , and velocity,\nus , coincide with \u03c12 and u2 . The sonic condition therefore reads\nu2 = s + c(\u03c12 ),\n\n(2.12)\n\nfrom which the jamiton speed, s, can be determined. With \u03c12 and u2 defined\nas functions of (\u03c1+ , u+ , s) via figure 2, (2.12) is an algebraic equation that\ndetermines s as a function of (\u03c1+ , u+ ). In general, (2.12) must be solved numerically, however, in \u00a7 5 we provide an example where an analytic solution\nis possible. Finally, we point out that (i) the restriction uM > 0 must be\nimposed, where uM = s+m/\u03c1M is the speed corresponding to the maximum\ntraffic density, \u03c1M ; (ii) the cases of u2 = u1 , where u1 is defined in figure 2,\nor of no intersections between the solid and dashed curves of figure 2 do not\nyield jamitons.\nThe methodology summarized above is reminiscent of the related analyses in gas dynamics [17, 18], shallow water theory [19, 23, 24], astrophysical\naccretion flow [25], and Newtonian flow in elastic tubes [26], where ordinary\ndifferential equations similar to (2.3) are obtained. Indeed, (2.12) is the\nexact analog of the Chapman-Jouguet condition in detonation theory [17].\n9\n\n\fSummarizing the above discussion, the following algorithm may be applied to determine the jamiton structure:\n(i) For a prescribed downstream state, (\u03c1+ , u+ ), the regularization condition (2.12) specifies the permissible value(s) for the wave speed, s.\n(ii) Once s is determined, the state upstream of the shock, (\u03c1\u2212 , u\u2212 ), is\ncomputed using the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions (2.4 \u2013 2.5).\n(iii) Equation (2.3) is then integrated forward in \u03b7, from the initial condition u = u+ up until u = u\u2212 is reached - the traffic density, \u03c1, follows\nautomatically from (2.2). This defines the period \u03bb of the traveling\nwave or, equivalently, the circumference of the periodic roadway.\n(iv) The total number of vehicles, N , which remains fixed in time when\nthere are no on-ramps or off-ramps, is then evaluated from\nN =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03c1 dx.\n\n(2.13)\n\n0\n\nThe jamitons thus obtained have the following properties: (i) The traffic\nspeed smoothly increases in the downstream direction (du/d\u03b7 > 0), except at the location of the shock, across which there is an abrupt drop in\nu; (ii) The traffic density smoothly decreases in the downstream direction\n(d\u03c1/d\u03b7 < 0), except at the location of the shock, across which there is an\nabrupt increase in \u03c1. This is consistent with the experimental observations\nof Sugiyama et al. [15].\nThe above algorithm provides a parameterization of the periodic jamitons using (\u03c1+ , u+ ). Equivalent parameterizations, in terms of (\u03c1\u2212 , u\u2212 ),\nare just as easy to produce. However, these are not necessarily ideal parameterizations. For example, in order to predict what jamiton configuration\nmight arise from a given set of initial conditions, on a given closed roadway,2\na parameterization in terms of the roadway length, \u03bb, and the total number\nof vehicles, N , would be more desirable. On the other hand, for the example\nconsidered in \u00a7 5, and all the other case studies that we have examined to\ndate, \u03c1\u2212 maps in a one-to-one fashion to N . Thus, by applying the above\nalgorithm, one can iteratively determine the unique traveling wave solution\ncorresponding to particular choices for the functions p and \u0169, the parameters\n\u03c4 and \u03bb, and the average traffic density \u03c1avg = N \u03bb\u22121 .\n2\n\nSay to predict the patterns arising in the experiments by Sugiyama et al. [15].\n\n10\n\n\f3\n\nAlternative description of the momentum equation\n\nThe existence of self-sustained shock solutions is not specific to the details of\nthe continuum model used. It is, in fact, a feature of models involving hyperbolic conservation laws with forcing terms under rather generic conditions.\nTo illustrate this point, we shall briefly consider the equations presented by\nAw & Rascle [11] and Helbing [12]. These models were developed in response\nto the criticisms of Daganzo [22], who argued that second order models are\nnecessarily flawed - they predict, for example, shocks overtaking individual\nvehicles in unsteady traffic flow, and negative vehicle speeds at the end of a\nstopped queue.\nAw & Rascle [11] overcome such limitations by applying a convective,\nrather than a spatial, derivative when modeling the effects of preventive\ndriving (the anticipation term in their nomenclature). This leads to the\nmomentum equation (1.2) being replaced by\n(u + p)t + u (u + p)x =\n\n1\n(\u0169 \u2212 u) .\n\u03c4\n\n(3.1)\n\nBy substitution of the mass continuity equation (1.1), (3.1) can be re-written\nas\n1\nut + (u \u2212 c2 \u03c1) ux = (\u0169 \u2212 u) .\n(3.2)\n\u03c4\nIntroducing the self-similar variable \u03b7 defined by (2.1), it can be shown that\ndu\n(u \u2212 s) (\u0169 \u2212 u)\n=\n,\nd\u03b7\n(u \u2212 s)2 \u2212 m c2\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich is identical to (2.3), except that the sonic point is now predicted to\noccur when u\u2212s = m1/2 c. As before, the singularity of (3.3) - i.e. the sonic\npoint, where the denominator vanishes - is regularized by aligning the sonic\npoint with a root of \u0169 \u2212 u. The remainder of the analysis is entirely similar\nto that outlined previously for (1.1 \u2013 1.2), with appropriate modifications\nto the shock conditions. Under the Aw & Rascle formulation, the RankineHugoniot condition corresponding to the conservation of momentum takes\nthe form\ns [\u03c1 (u + p)] = [\u03c1 u p + \u03c1 u2 ],\n(3.4)\nwhich replaces (2.5).\nHelbing [12] generalized Aw & Rascle's model one step further by defining two traffic pressures, both functions of \u03c1 and u, such that the momentum\n11\n\n\fequation reads\nut + u ux +\n\n1 \u2202p1\n1 \u2202p2\n1\n\u03c1x +\nux = (\u0169 \u2212 u).\n\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1\n\u03c1 \u2202u\n\u03c4\n\n(3.5)\n\nProceeding as above, the following familiar expression can be readily obtained:\ndu\n(u \u2212 s) (\u0169 \u2212 u)\n=\n,\n(3.6)\nd\u03b7\n(u \u2212 s)2 \u2212 \u03c2 2\nwhere\n\n\u03c2 2 = c21 + m c22 ,\nin which\nc21 =\n\n\u2202p1\n\u2202\u03c1\n\nand c22 = \u2212\n\n(3.7)\n1 \u2202p2\n.\n\u03c12 \u2202u\n\nThe Payne-Whitham and Aw & Rascle results may be recovered from (3.6)\nby setting, respectively, p1 = p, p2 = 0; and p1 = 0, p2 = \u2212u \u03c12 dp/d\u03c1.\n\n4\n\nPhase plane analysis\n\nGeneralizing the analyses of \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 3, du/d\u03b7 may be expressed as\ndu\n(u \u2212 s) (\u0169 \u2212 u)\n=\n,\nd\u03b7\n(u \u2212 s)2 \u2212 \u03a9 c2\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03a9 = 1 and m, respectively, for the Payne-Whitham and Aw & Rascle\nmodels. Further information regarding model behavior near the sonic point\nmay be gleaned by introducing the phase plane variable \u03be, and rewriting\n(4.1) as the following pair of ordinary differential equations\ndu\nd\u03be\nd\u03b7\nd\u03be\n\n= (u \u2212 s) (\u0169 \u2212 u) = F1 (u),\n\n(4.2)\n\n= (u \u2212 s)2 \u2212 \u03a9 c2 = F2 (u).\n\n(4.3)\n\nNote that the sonic point is a critical point of (4.2) and (4.3). The Jacobian,\nJ , of the above pair of equations is then given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nF1,u 0\nJ =\n,\n(4.4)\nF2,u 0\n\n12\n\n\fwhere\n\u001a\n\nF1,u\nF2,u\nin which\n\n\u001b\nm \u0169\u03c1\n= \u2212(u \u2212 s)\n+ 1 + \u0169 \u2212 u,\n(u \u2212 s)2\n\u03a9m\np\u03c1\u03c1 ,\n= 2 (u \u2212 s) +\n(u \u2212 s)2\n\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n\nd\u0169\nd2 p\ndc2\n< 0 and p\u03c1\u03c1 \u2261 2 =\n.\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\nTherefore, at the sonic point the eigenvalues (r1 and r2 ) of J are given by\n\u0169\u03c1 \u2261\n\nm |\u0169\u03c1 |\n\u2212 \u03a91/2 c = F1,u .\n(4.7)\n\u03a91/2 c\nWhen r2 > 0 (respectively r2 < 0), du/d\u03b7 > 0 (respectively du/d\u03b7 < 0)\nat the sonic point.

Thus\na complete analysis of the solution behavior near this critical point requires\na careful, but ultimately tangential, examination of the leading order contributions by nonlinearities. Nevertheless, an interesting observation can be\nmade:\nAs we illustrate by way of example in \u00a7 5, r2 = 0 coincides\nwith the boundary wherein a constant uniform base state be(4.9)\ncomes unstable to infinitesimal disturbances - see figure 4\nand Appendix C.\nThe theoretical underpinnings of this coincidence are not entirely clear.\nHowever, our numerical experiments show that there is a strong connection between jamitons and instabilities:\nWhen a uniform traffic state is linearly unstable, the instability consistently saturates into a jamiton-dominated state.\n\n(4.10)\n\nFor the more general analysis of Helbing [12] discussed at the end of \u00a7 3,\nF2,u is given by\nm\nF2,u = 2 (u \u2212 s) +\n\u03c2 2,\n(u \u2212 s)2 \u03c1\n2(u \u2212 s)\nm\np2,u \u2212 p2,u\u03c1 , (4.11)\n= 2 (u \u2212 s) +\np1,\u03c1\u03c1 +\n(u \u2212 s)2\nm\n13\n\n\fwhere \u03c2 2 is defined by (3.7). Given the form of the Jacobian matrix J ,\nmodifying F2,u does not alter the eigenvalues r1 and r2 .\n\n5\n\nAn example\n\n5.1\n\nPreliminaries\n\nTo make the ideas of the previous sections more concrete, we consider herein\nparticular forms for p and \u0169, and carefully examine the resulting range of\nsolutions. As alluded to above, various expressions for p and \u0169 have been\nproposed in the traffic literature. Consistent with the spirit of previous\nstudies (e.g. [9,27]), our motivation is to select relatively simple functions so\nthat the concepts of \u00a7 2 are succinctly illustrated with minimum algebraic\ninvestment. Thus, a Lighthill-Whitham-Richards forcing term of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1\n\u0169 = \u01690 1 \u2212\n,\n(5.1)\n\u03c1M\nis chosen. Moreover, by analogy with the shallow water equations [23], we\nselect\np = 21 \u03b2 \u03c12 ,\n(5.2)\nso that p\u03c1 = c2 \u221d \u03c1 [11]. Alternatively, one could define p to be singular\nin \u03c1, such that p\u03c1 \u221d \u03c1\u03c61 /(\u03c1M \u2212 \u03c1)\u03c62 for some \u03c61 , \u03c62 > 0. Whereas this,\nmore complicated, choice for p enforces \u03c1M as the maximum traffic density,\nthe resulting algebraic relations become somewhat unwieldy.

These are presented in Appendix A.\n\n5.2\n\nNumerical method\n\nIn order to validate the aforementioned theoretical solutions and assess jamiton stability, we performed numerical simulations using a Lagrangian particle method [28]. In this method, each discrete particle, i, is assigned an\ninitial position, xi , and speed, ui , which subsequently changes in time according to (5.13 \u2013 5.18). The mass balance equation (1.1) is satisfied identically as the particles move, i.e. the numerical scheme is mass-conservative by\nconstruction. Importantly, the number of particles is typically two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the number of vehicles. Thus, although a Lagrangian\napproach is employed, the numerical scheme constitutes a macroscopic, not\na microscopic, description of traffic flow, albeit one with an intuitive link\nbetween the particle and vehicle density.\nIn general terms, the numerical method solves the differential equations\n(\n\u1e8bi = ui ,\n(5.13)\nu\u0307i = ai ,\nwhere the particle acceleration, u\u0307i , is expressed as\ndu\n(xi , t) = ut (xi , t) + u ux (xi , t),\ndt\n\n(5.14)\n\nc(\u03c1(xi , t))2\n1\n\u03c1x (xi , t) + {\u0169(\u03c1(xi , t)) \u2212 u(xi , t)} .\n\u03c1(xi , t)\n\u03c4\n\n(5.15)\n\nand\nai = \u2212\n\n16\n\n\fThe distance between adjacent particles i and i + 1 is defined by di+ 1 =\n2\nxi+1 \u2212 xi .

From (5.16), we define the vehicle\ndensity and the density gradient using a non-equidistant finite-difference\nstencil [29]:\ndi+ 1 \u03c1i\u2212 1 + di\u2212 1 \u03c1i+ 1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c1i =\n,\n(5.17)\ndi+ 1 + di\u2212 1\n2\n\n\u03c1i,x =\n\n2\n\n\u03c1i+ 1 \u2212 \u03c1i\u2212 1\n2\n\n2\n\nmin{di+ 1 , 2 di\u2212 1 } + min{di\u2212 1 , 2 di+ 1 }\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(5.18)\n\n2\n\nThe denominator in (5.18) is chosen so that, at the location of the shock,\na given particle is influenced only by its nearest neighbor. The numerical\nscheme is stable - however, it produces bounded but unphysical oscillations\nwherever the vehicle density or speed changes abruptly. We suppress these\nfeatures by adding a small amount of numerical viscosity, so that at each\ntime step the velocity profile is smoothed out.\n\n5.3\n\nResults\n\nHere we compare the theory of self-sustained traffic jams developed in \u00a7 2 and\n\u00a7 5.1, and numerical solutions of (1.1 \u2013 1.2) - obtained using the algorithm\nof \u00a7 5.2.

Because a description, both theoretical and numerical, of\njamitons is the central focus of the present analysis, we deliberately select a\nvalue for \u03b2 towards the lower end of its representative range, so as to facilitate an explicit display of jamiton properties and behavior. Hence, \u03b2, whose\nexact numerical value is likely difficult to estimate in any event, is chosen so\nthat infinitesimal perturbations to a uniform base state develop into jamitons when the base-state density is 10% of \u03c1M - see Appendix C and,\nmore particularly, the stability condition (5.22). Whereas larger numerical\nvalues for \u03b2 could be selected, corresponding to a more restrictive instability condition, the jamitons observed in these cases, though qualitatively\nequivalent to those described below, are somewhat less easy to visualize.\nThe practical ramifications associated with choosing a larger value for \u03b2 are\nbriefly addressed when we discuss (after examining the results in figure 4)\nthe possibility of vehicular collisions.\nThe steady-state variations of u\u2217 and \u03c1\u2217 , as functions of the non-dimensional variable \u03b7 \u03c4 \u03c1M = x\u2217 \u2212 s\u2217 t\u2217 , are shown in figure 3 for a circular road\nof length \u03bb = 100 `, with two different choices for the conserved number of\nvehicles, N . The shock occurs at the two extreme ends of the horizontal\ndomain, and connects the ratios u\u2212 /\u01690 to u+ /\u01690 , and \u03c1\u2212 /\u03c1M to \u03c1+ /\u03c1M . In\nfigure 3 a, N = 27, and the maximum traffic density (i.e. \u03c1+ ) is predicted\nto be just below \u03c1M . Conversely, in figure 3 b, N is increased to 38, which\nresults in \u03c1+ > \u03c1M . The physical implications of this result are considered\nin the following two paragraphs. Both theoretical and numerical data are\nincluded in figure 3. The comparison is very favorable, except right at the\nshock location - where the numerical scheme smears the shock.\nFigure 4 indicates, as a function of the normalized average traffic density\n\u03c1avg /\u03c1M (where \u03c1avg = N /\u03bb), the range of possible solutions allowed by the\nmodel equations in \u00a7 5.1. The thick solid curves of figures 4 a,b show \u03c1\u2212 /\u03c1M\nand \u03c1+ /\u03c1M , respectively, whereas the thick dashed curves show u\u2212 /\u01690 and\nu+ /\u01690 , respectively. As with the discussion in \u00a7 2, we observe that, for\na prescribed road length \u03bb and model parameters \u03c1M , \u01690 , \u03b2, and \u03c4 , the\naverage density \u03c1avg (hence N ) uniquely determines the flow conditions to\neither side of the shock.

The numerical solutions are the final, asymptotic state\nof an evolution started with a small perturbation of a uniform unstable base state - see (5.22). The agreement of this final state with the\njamiton corresponding to the same road length, \u03bb, and number of vehicles, N , is remarkable. The plots show profiles of \u03c1/\u03c1M and u/\u01690 versus\n\u03b7 \u03c4 \u03c1M = (x \u2212 st) \u03c1M . The equations and parameters are as in (5.19 \u2013 5.21),\nwith \u03bb = 100 ` = 500 m. In panel (a) N = 27 (\u03c1avg /\u03c1M = 0.272). In panel\n(b) N = 38 (\u03c1avg /\u03c1M = 0.384).\nsignificant in that they predict the following forms of model breakdown:\n\u03c1+ > \u03c1M when \u03c1avg /\u03c1M > 0.277 and u+ < 0 when \u03c1avg /\u03c1M > 0.391.3\nRather than signifying a fundamental modeling flaw, observations of\nmodel breakdown provide helpful guidance in the safe design of modern\nroadways. In particular, for the choice of parameters germane to figure 4,\nvehicular collisions (i.e. \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1M ) are anticipated once the average centerto-center separation between adjacent vehicles falls below approximately\n3.6 `. Needless to say, this simple result is not universal for all types of\ntraffic flow or roadway conditions. We consider herein a periodic track of\nprescribed length (500 m), particular functional forms for the traffic pressure,\np, and equilibrium speed, \u0169, and a liberal numerical value for \u03b2 such that\njamitons appear even in relatively light traffic. In particular, choosing a\nlarger value for \u03b2 would delay, though not necessarily avoid, the onset of\nvehicular collisions.\nThe roadway's carrying capacity could, in principle, be increased if two\nor more traveling waves were to be forced rather than the single density spike\nconsidered here. However, our numerical simulations suggest that such bi3\n\nIn Appendix B, we verify that \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1M before u+ \u2192 0.\n\n19\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n2\n\n\u03c1 \u2212 /\u03c1 M\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c1+ /\u03c1M , u+ /\u01690 , r2 /\u01690\n\n\u03c1\u2212 /\u03c1M , u\u2212 /\u01690 , r2 /\u01690\n\n2\nu\u2212 / \u01690\nr2 / \u01690\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\u03c1avg /\u03c1M\n\n\u03c1 + /\u03c1 M\n\n1.5\n\nr 2 / \u01690\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.4\n\nu+ / \u01690\n\n0.2\n\u03c1avg /\u03c1M\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 4: Parameters characterizing the exact jamiton solutions in \u00a7 5.1, for\na fixed road length \u03bb = 500 m, as functions of the number of vehicles, N .\nSpecifically, curves of \u03c1\u2212 /\u03c1M , \u03c1+ /\u03c1M , u\u2212 /\u01690 , and u+ /\u01690 versus \u03c1avg /\u03c1M =\nN /(\u03bb \u03c1M ) are shown, in addition to r2 /\u01690 - as given in (5.8). The vertical\ndashed line is the stability boundary specified by (5.22). The equations and\nparameters are as in (5.19 \u2013 5.21). Note that (i) r2 goes through 0 precisely\nat the stability boundary - see (4.9); (ii) the peak density \u03c1+ reaches \u03c1M\nbefore u+ becomes negative - see Appendix B.\nor multi-modal structures are often unstable, and that they quickly coalesce\ninto a single structure. By contrast, unimodal traveling wave solutions of\nthe type illustrated in figure 3 appear to be stable to small perturbations -\nexcept in the special case where the periodic roadway is made to be quite\n>\nlong, i.e. \u223c 2 km for the parameters appropriate to figures 3 and 4. On an\nextended circuit, the traveling wave solutions have a long, nearly constant\nstate downstream of the shock - whose average density exceeds the requirement for linear stability discussed below. Thus infinitesimal perturbations\nmay grow, leading to further traveling waves, albeit of slightly different\n>\namplitude from the original. Owing to the circuit length (i.e. \u223c 2 km, as\ncompared to the 500 m long circuit considered in figure 3), these traveling\nwaves are dynamically independent in that wave coalescence does not occur\nfor a rather long time, if at all.\nWhile the above observations would benefit from the development of\na more fundamental framework, it can be difficult to describe analytically\nthe spatio-temporal stability of self-sustained traveling waves, due primarily\nto the transonic nature of the solution (see e.g. Stewart & Kasimov [18],\nBalmforth & Mandre [24] and Yu & Kevorkian [30]). Work is on-going\nto adapt nonlinear stability analyses for specific application to continuum\ntraffic models.\n20\n\n\fIn Appendix C we compute the boundary between linearly stable and\nunstable uniform base states, which is given by\n\u03c1\n\u03b2 \u03c1M\n=\n.\n\u03c1M\n\u016920\n\n(5.22)\n\nIn connection with this boundary, we point out the following facts, which together with (4.9 \u2013 4.10), reinforce the point that there is a strong connection\nbetween jamitons and uniform flow instabilities.\n\u2022 Figure 4 shows that [\u03c1 ] \u2192 0 and [u] \u2192 0, as \u03c1avg /\u03c1M \u2193 \u03b2 \u03c1M /\u016920 . Thus\nthe jamiton amplitude becomes smaller as the corresponding uniform\nflow becomes less unstable, and vanishes altogether in the limit.\n\u2022 The stability criterion (5.22) also specifies the location at which u1 =\nu2 , where u1 and u2 are defined in figure 2. Once u1 and u2 coalesce,\nno self-sustained shock wave may occur - since condition (a) in (2.11)\nfails. This is consistent with the discussion of the previous bullet, of\ncourse.\nThus jamitons become possible when the corresponding uniform state becomes unstable and - see (4.10) - the basic flow state changes from uniform\nflow to a jamiton-dominated state. In other words, evidence indicates that\nA crucial bifurcation in the traffic flow behavior occurs at the\nstability boundary prescribed by (5.22).\n\n(5.23)\n\nWe defer a more in-depth investigation of this question for future work.\nFinally, note that although the boundary specified by (5.22) is mathematically robust, in practice it may become \"fuzzy\" owing to the possible\nbreakdowns of the continuum hypothesis, especially at low vehicle concentrations.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work, we have found and successfully exploited a strong similarity\nbetween gas-dynamical detonation waves and shocks in traffic flow, in order\nto develop a theory of \"jamitons,\" steady self-sustained traffic shocks. Jamitons naturally arise from small instabilities in relatively dense traffic flow,\nand can be interpreted as saturated phantom jams. While a single jamiton\nmay not necessarily significantly delay individual vehicles, a succession of\njamitons, as might arise during rush hour, for example, is expected to frustrate motorists over long lengths of roadway. Moreover, jamitons represent\n21\n\n\fregions in which the traffic density increases dramatically over a relatively\nshort distance [15] and, as such, are hot spots for vehicular collisions.\nThe analogy drawn above goes beyond the weaker analogy with inert\nshock waves in gas dynamics considered by Kerner, Klenov & Konh\u00e4user\n[27]. Unlike inert shocks, detonation waves can be self-sustained, due to the\nexistence of a sonic point in direct correspondence with the traffic model we\nconsider here.\nUsing the Lax entropy conditions for hyperbolic conservation laws, we\nshow that for realistic pressure and equilibrium-speed functions, the only\nallowable self-sustained shocks are those that are overtaken by individual\nvehicles. Moreover, for the simple, but widely-applied, choices \u0169 = \u01690 (1 \u2212\n\u03c1/\u03c1M ) and p \u221d \u03c1\u03b3 , with \u03b3 = 1, 2, we are able to describe the jamiton\nstructure analytically. Theoretical solutions show excellent agreement with\nthe output from direct numerical simulations of the governing system.\nExamples of jamitons with \u03b3 = 2 are illustrated in figure 3. Beyond a\ncritical average density, we predict solutions for which the density immediately downstream of the shock exceeds the maximum allowable density, \u03c1M ,\ncorresponding, physically, to a state of vehicular collisions (figure 4). Such\ninstances offer important design insights for roadways; most obviously, it is\nadvantageous to choose speed limits and roadway carrying capacities so as\n>\nto avoid circumstances where densities with \u03c1 \u223c \u03c1M are \"triggered\" (say, by\na jamiton) anywhere within the domain.\nHaving identified self-sustained traveling wave solutions in traffic flow, a\nmajor objective of future research is to ascertain their spatio-temporal stability. Some of the analytical challenges associated with this line of inquiry\nare identified in \u00a7 5.3. Resolving issues of stability offers the possibility\nof increasing roadway efficiency, for example, by exciting multiple traveling\nwaves of relatively low density as compared to the single density spike exhibited in figure 3. We hope to report on the results of such an analysis\nsoon.\nAcknowledgments\nPartial support for J.-C. Nave, R. R. Rosales and B. Seibold was provided\nthrough NSF grant DMS-0813648. Funding for A.

As before, the traffic speed is given as an implicit function of\n\u03b7 in (A.1).\n\nB\n\nModel behavior for \u03c1 > \u03c1M\n\nFrom the discussion of \u00a7 5, vehicular collisions are forecast once \u03c1+ = \u03c1M ,\nwhereas nonsensical vehicle speeds are predicted once u+ < 0. It is demonstrated herein that the former condition is necessarily achieved before the\nlatter.\nEquation (2.2) shows that\n\u03c1+ (u+ \u2212 s) = \u03c1M (uM \u2212 s) = m > 0,\n\n(B.1)\n\nwhere uM , which must be positive for jamitons to exist, is defined in figure\n2 b. As u+ \u2192 0, the left-hand side of (B.1) approaches \u2212\u03c1+ s, demonstrating\nthat s < 0. In this limit, therefore,\n\u03c1+\nuM \u2212 s\n=\n> 1.\n\u03c1M\n|s|\n\n(B.2)\n\nThis result can be understood intuitively by examining the functional form\nof the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards forcing term (see (5.1)): \u0169 < 0 requires\n\u03c1 > \u03c1M . Clearly, the sensible alternative is to define \u0169 = 0 for \u03c1 > \u03c1M . The\npoint is moot, however: this amounts to correcting the model equations in\na regime that is already physically unrealistic.\n23\n\n\fC\n\nLinear stability of the Payne-Whitham\nmodel considered in \u00a7 5\n\nFor a right-hand side forcing function of type (5.1), the constant base state\nsolution to (1.1) and (1.2) is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1\u0303\n\u03c1 = \u03c1\u0303,\nu = \u01690 1 \u2212\n.\n(C.1)\n\u03c1M\nFollowing ideas discussed in Kerner & Konh\u00e4user [9], Helbing [12] and elsewhere, the linear stability of this base state can be explored by introducing\nperturbation (hatted) quantities, defined such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1\u0303\n\u03c1 = \u03c1\u0303 + \u03c1\u0302,\nu = \u01690 1 \u2212\n+ \u00fb,\n(C.2)\n\u03c1M\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 and \u00fb are expressed in terms of normal modes by\n\u03c1\u0302 = R\u0302 eikx+\u03c3t\n\nand \u00fb = \u00db eikx+\u03c3t .\n\n(C.3)\n\nHere k is the horizontal wave number and \u03c3 is the corresponding growth\nrate. Application of (C.2) and (C.3) into (1.1) and (1.2) shows that\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9\n\u03c3 + ik\u03c8\ni k \u03c1\u0303\n0\nR\u0302\n\uf8f0 \u01690\n\uf8fb\uf8f0\n\uf8fb = \uf8f0 \uf8fb,\n(C.4)\n+ i \u03b2 k \u03c3 + i k \u03c8 + \u03c41\n\u00db\n0\n\u03c4 \u03c1M\nwhere, for notational economy, we have introduced\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c1\u0303\n\u03c8 = \u01690 1 \u2212\n.\n\u03c1M\n\n(C.5)\n\nRequiring that the determinant of the matrix from (C.4) vanish shows that\n\u03c3 = \u2212i k \u03c8 \u2212\n\n1\n(1 + \u03a5),\n2\u03c4\n\nin which\n\u03a52 = 1 \u2212 4 k 2 \u03b2 \u03c1\u0303 \u03c4 2 + 4 i k \u01690 \u03c4\n\n(C.6)\n\u03c1\u0303\n.\n\u03c1M\n\n(C.7)\n\nGenerically, \u03a5 may be written as \u03a5 = \u039b1 \u2212 i\u039b2 , where\n\u039b21 \u2212 \u039b22 = 1 \u2212 4 k 2 \u03b2 \u03c1\u0303 \u03c4 2 ,\n24\n\n(C.8)\n\n\fand\n\u039b1 \u039b2 = \u22122 k \u01690 \u03c4\n\n\u03c1\u0303\n.\n\u03c1M\n\n(C.9)\n\nEliminating \u039b2 from (C.8) and (C.9) yields the following polynomial expression:\nP(\u039b21 ) = \u039b41 \u2212 (1 \u2212 4 k 2 \u03b2 \u03c1\u0303 \u03c4 2 ) \u039b21 \u2212 4 k 2 \u016920 \u03c4 2\n\n\u03c1\u03032\n= 0.\n\u03c12M\n\n(C.10)\n\nLinear stability requires a non-positive growth rate, i.e.\nReal(\u03c3) \u2264 0\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n0 \u2264 \u039b21 \u2264 1\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nP(1) \u2265 0.\n\n(C.11)\n\nFrom (C.10), the latter condition is satisfied provided\n\u03b2\u2265\n\n\u03c1\u0303 \u016920\n.\n\u03c12M\n\n(C.12)\n\nThis completes the derivation of (5.22).\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
