We find that the expansion\naround the topological theory coincides with the usual expansion around the abelian theory, though the\nequivalence is non\u2013trivial. In this context, the technique appears therefore to be viable, but not to bring\nparticularly new insights. Some implications for gravity are discussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nConventional quantum field theory (QFT) treats interacting theories in a perturbative expansion around the\nquadratic term of the action. This procedure can be applied to general relativity (GR) by expanding the\nmetric field around a fixed background, yielding the background\u2013dependent perturbative quantum gravity\nof Feynman, DeWitt, Veltman and many others. The theory is non\u2013renormalizable [1], and the approach\nmakes sense only for computing low energy gravitons scattering. The question is open whether the non\u2013\nrenormalizability is an intristic feature of the theory \u2013and GR must be modified to be a consistent theory\u2013,\nor it has to do with the perturbative expansion chosen. In this case, GR could be non\u2013perturbatively\nrenormalizable, or even finite [2]. In this case however, a perturbative expansion, different from the standard\none, could still be well defined.\nAn implementation of this idea has been recently proposed in [3], based on the fact that GR can be\nwritten as a modified BF theory. BF is a topological field theory that can be quantized exactly and is\nfinite, as first showed by Witten in 3d [4]. The relevance of topological theories also for 4d quantum gravity\nis suspected since long [5], and has been exploited in a number of ways. The idea of [3], in particular, is\nto construct quantum GR via a perturbative expansion around the topological theory (see also [4]). This\napproach is radically new and raises a number of questions. In particular, the unperturbed theory has no\nlocal degrees of freedom. Does it make sense to expand a non\u2013trivial QFT around a topological theory? In\nthis paper, we address this question by studying such expansion in a simpler case: Yang\u2013Mills (YM) theory\non a flat background.\nIn fact, YM theory too can be written as a modified BF theory [6], sometimes called BFYM. The conventional perturbative expansion of BFYM, where the zero'th order is the kinetic term, has been investigated in\ndetail in the literature (see for instance the last reference in [6]). Here we show, however, that the coupling\nconstant g0 can be moved in such a way that the zero'th order is BF theory. Therefore, the expansion in\ng0 becomes an expansion around the topological theory, precisely as the one proposed for quantum gravity.\nWe thus investigate the perturbative expansion of the theory in this formulation. In particular, we compute\nthe propagator in a power series in g0 .\nWe find that the resulting expansion is equal to the standard one. In the non\u2013abelian case, an interesting\nsubtlety arises: the leading non\u2013vanishing order is abelian, as expected, in spite of the non\u2013abelian nature\nof the zero'th order BF term. We discuss the implications of this result for gravity in the final section 3.\n\u2217 rovelli@cpt.univ-mrs.fr,\n\nsimone.speziale@roma1.infn.it\n\n\fThe possibility of expanding YM around BF opens the way to a homogeneous treatment of quantum\ngravity and YM theory. A proposal in this direction is under study [7], and the present work provides\nsupport for the viability of the approach.\n\n2\n\nExpansion around BF of Yang\u2013Mills theory\n\nConsider YM theory with gauge group G, say SU(N ). We call Aa\u03bc the YM connection. The index a is in\na\nthe algebra g of G. The YM curvature is F\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc + f abc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd , where f abc are the gauge group\nstructure constants. We use greek letters \u03bc = 0, . . . , 3 for spacetime indices and [\u03bc\u03bd] = \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u03bc. For a\ncompact notation, we use the formalism of p-forms, where F = 21 F\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd = dA + 21 [A, A] and introduce\nthe Hodge star \u2217, defined by \u2217F\u03bc\u03bd = 21 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1\u03c3 F\u03c1\u03c3 . We also introduce a g-valued 2-form B a .\nConsider the following two actions:\n1. the standard second\u2013order YM action\nSYM [Aa\u03bc ] =\n\n1\n4g0 2\n\nZ\n\na\nd4 x F\u03bc\u03bd\nFa\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n\n1\n2g0 2\n\nZ\n\nTr F \u2227 \u2217F ;\n\n(1)\n\ng0 2\n2\n\nZ\n\nTr B \u2227 \u2217B.\n\n(2)\n\n2. and the first order action\na\nSBFYM [B\u03bc\u03bd\n, Aa\u03bd ] = i\n\nZ\n\nTr B \u2227 F \u2212\n\nThe traces Tr are over the algebra indices. The equivalence of the two actions can be easily checked: the\nequation of motion\ni\n\u03b4SBFYM\na\n= \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03c1\u03c3\n+ g0 2 Ba\u03bc\u03bd\n0=\na\n\u03b4B\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nimplies\na\nB\u03bc\u03bd\n=\u2212\n\ni\na\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1\u03c3 F\u03c1\u03c3\n.\n2g0 2\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bb\u03c4\nPlugging (3) into (2) and using \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c4 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = \u22122\u03b4[\u03c1\u03c3]\n, we obtain (1). Therefore, the two actions describe the\nsame classical theory.\nFor g0 = 0 the action (2) reduces to the action for BF theory. When using the action (1), one usually\nrescales the connection A 7\u2192 g0 A. In this way the coupling constant is moved in front of the commutator\nterm of the curvature, F = dA + 21 g0 [A, A]. For g0 = 0, thus, the scaled YM action reduces to the quadratic\nterm.\nTo construct the quantum theory, we define the (Euclidean) n-point Green functions\nZ\nR\n2\n1\n1\nYM a1 ...an\n(4)\n\u0393 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcn [x1 . . . xn ; g0 ] :=\nDA Aa\u03bc11 (x1 ) . . . Aa\u03bcnn (xn ) e\u2212 4 Tr (dA+g0 [A,A]) \u2212Sgf (A) ,\nZ\n\nfor the (rescaled) action (1), and\na ...a\n\n\u0393BFYM \u03bc11 ...\u03bcnn [x1 . . . xn ; g0 ] :=\n\n1\nZ\n\nZ\n\nDB DA Aa\u03bc11 (x1 ) . . . Aa\u03bcnn (xn ) e\u2212i\n\nR\n\nTr B\u2227F +\n\ng0 2\n2\n\nR\n\nTr B\u2227\u2217B\u2212Sgf (B,A)\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nfor the action (2). Here Z is the partition function, namely the functional integral without the field insertions,\nand Sgf (A) and Sgf (B, A) are appropriate gauge\u2013fixing terms. In the following we use the Lorentz gauge.\nFormally, these Green functions are equivalent: integrating over the B field in (5), we indeed obtain\nn\n\u0393YM \u03bca11...a\n...\u03bcn [x1 . . . xn ; g0 ] =\n\n1 BFYM a1 ...an\n\u0393\n\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn [x1 . . . xn ; g0 ].\ng0 n\n\n(6)\n\nThe factor g0 \u2212n comes from the rescaling used in (4). Since n-point Green functions are the basic building\nblocks of QFT, the equivalence above would guarantee that the two actions give rise to the same quantum\ntheory. However, the equivalence is only formal, until we can actually define and evaluate the integrals. In\nQFT, the conventional way of doing so is by expanding the functional integrals in g0 around a gaussian\n\n\fintegral, that can be evaluated. If the equivalence holds, then the two expansions should coincide, order by\norder. That is, (getting rid of indices and arguments)\ni\n1 h\n(7)\n\u0393YM (0) + g0 \u0393YM (1) + g0 2 \u0393YM (2) + . . . = n \u0393BFYM (0) + g0 2 \u0393BFYM (1) + g0 4 \u0393BFYM (2) + . . . .\ng0\nHowever, there are different reasons for doubting this equivalence, and it is far from obvious how the two\nexpansions could coincide. In particular, the two zero'th orders are extremely different:\n\u2022 In (4), the zero'th order is a free abelian theory, namely a gaussian integral, which depends on the\nmetric and has lost track of the non\u2013abelian structure,\nZ\nR\n2\n1\n1\nM a1 ...an\n\u0393 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcn [x1 . . . xn ] :=\nDA Aa\u03bc11 (x1 ) . . . Aa\u03bcnn (xn ) e\u2212 4 Tr (dA) \u2212Sgf (A) .\nZ\n\u2022 In (5), the other way around, the zero'th order is not gaussian, the theory depends on the non\u2013abelian\nstructure and has lost track of the metric of spacetime,\nZ\nR\n1\nBF a1 ...an\nDB DA Aa\u03bc11 (x1 ) . . .

Below we show that\nthey do. The differences are harmless, and (7) holds, order by order.

The gauge\u2013fixing term only concernes the\nconnection.

As above, we introduce a source ja\u03bc for the connection,\nbut also a source \u03b7a\u03bc\u03bd for the B field.

The equation is non\u2013linear, and we do not know the analitic form of the solution.\nHowever, as we see from (14), only the linear dependence of A\u03b7 on \u03b7 matters. Let us therefore expand A\u03b7\nin a power series in \u03b7,\nZ\nZ\n\u03bd\u03c1\n\u03bd\u03c1\n\u03c3\u03c4\nA\u03b7 a\u03bc (x) = dy G1 ab\n(x,\ny)\n\u03b7\n(y)\n+\ndydz G2 abc\n(16)\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4 (x, y, z) \u03b7b (y)\u03b7c (z) + . . .\nb\nWhen we insert (16) in (15), the leading order, in Fourier components, is\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c1\u03c3\np[\u03bc G1 ab\n\u03bd]\u03b1\u03b2 (p) \u03b7b (p) = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b7a (p).\n\n\fRemarkably, G1 is only sensible to the abelian structure of the theory.

But (15) at quadratic order in \u03b7 depends on the non\u2013abelian structure, and\nwe expect to obtain the usual g0 2 corrections to the free propagator. We do not perform here the explicit\ncalculations.\nFrom the discussion above, we conclude that the perturbative expansion around BF of YM theory on\nflat spacetime coincides with the conventional one.\n\n3\n\nConsequences for gravity\n\nTwo different formulations of GR as modified BF theories have been considered in the literature, as starting\npoint for the quantisation:\n1. The Plebanski action,\nIJ\nS[B\u03bc\u03bd\n, \u03c9\u03bcIJ , \u03bcIJKL ] =\n\n1\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\nTr B \u2227 F (\u03c9) +\n\nZ\n\n\u03bcIJKL B IJ \u2227 B KL ,\n\n(19)\n\nused in [8]. The latin indices are in the group SO(3, 1) (or SO(4) in the Riemannian version). This\nhas been used for the quantum gravity models described in [9].\n2. The MacDowell\u2013Mansouri action,\nZ\nZ\nIJ\nIJ\nS[B\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c9\u03bc ] = Tr B \u2227 F (\u03c9) \u2212 8\u03c0G \u01ebIJKLM v M B IJ \u2227 B KL ,\n\n(20)\n\nused in [10, 11]. The latin indices are in the group SO(4, 1) (SO(5) in the Riemannian version). This\nis a more recent approach to the problem, and its quantisation has been considered in [3].\nBoth actions describe modified BF theories. However, there is a substantial difference between the two. The\nadditional term in (19) is a constraint, whereas the additional term in (20) is a genuine interaction. The B\nfield in (19) is a fundamental variable (and \u03bc is a Lagrange multiplier), while the B field in (20) is only a\nLagrange multiplier. Notice also the different position of the Newton's constant G.\nThe perturbative treatment of the additional term appears more natural with the action (20). In the\nrest of the discussion we focus on this approach. We assume 8\u03c0G/~ \u226a 1, and we discuss the perturbative\nexpansion\nZGR =\n\n\u0012Z\n\u0013n\nZ\n\u221e\nR\nX\n1 \u2212i8\u03c0G n\ni\nM\nIJ\nKL\n(\n)\nDB D\u03c9\ne~\n\u01ebIJKLM v B \u2227 B\nn!\n~\nn=0\n\nTr B\u2227F (\u03c9)\n\n(21)\n\nof the partition function of quantum GR.\nIt is important to distinguish the two cases, of compact or non\u2013compact spacetime. If spacetime is non\u2013\ncompact, appropriate boundary conditions on the fields must be chosen, in order for the functional integrals\nto be well\u2013defined. In the previous discussion of YM on flat spacetime, we implicitely chose vanishing\nboundary conditions for the fields at spacial infinity. Once the boundary conditions are chosen, the classical\n\n\fequations of motion select only one solution (up to gauge), and the functional integral defining the Green\nfunctions is generically picked around this solution, as discussed above. In this situation, we showed in the\nprevious section that the perturbative expansion around BF coincides with the conventional one. If we treat\nthe non\u2013compact case in gravity, we have to provide spacial boundary conditions for the gravitational field.\nThe natural choice here is asymptotic flatness: g\u03bc\u03bd 7\u2192 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd at infinity. When using the action (20), this is a\ncondition on the B field. Once this condition is fixed, we expect the quantum theory to be picked around\na classical solution (see the discussion in [12]). In this setting, we expect our analogy with YM theory to\nhold through: namely, (21) should give rise to the conventional (non\u2013renormalizable) perturbation theory in\nterms of gravitons. From this perspective, the \"expansion around the topological sector\" of the theory does\nnot appear to be different from the conventional expansion.\nThe situation is far less clear in the compact case, where the background field that minimizes the gaussian\naction, or is selected by the delta function, is not determined by asymptotic conditions. In particular, it\nhas been recently argued that the definition of the theory on a compact spacetime region with boundaries\nis more suitable to extract physical information from background independent theories [2, 13, 14, 15]. This\nis perhaps the situation where the proposal of [3] appears to be more interesting. We leave the discussion\non this case open for further developments.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. H. Goroff and A.
