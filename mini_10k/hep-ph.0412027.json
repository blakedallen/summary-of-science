The modern experimental\nresearches of the particle structure are performed with such an accuracy and for such energies that it calls for the relativistic theoretical method of interpretation of results. The\nimportant feature of these methods is the extraction of kinematical parts and invariant parts\n(form factors) from the current matrix elements. A representation of the matrix element in\nterms of form factors is called the parametrization of the current operator matrix element.\nLet us remark that it is just form factors \u2013 Lorentz invariant functions \u2013 that are extracted\nfrom scattering data usually.\nIn the relativistic theory of the description of composite systems, it is possible to identify\ntwo main but very different approaches (see e.g. [1] and the pictorial scheme on Fig. 11 in\nthe review [2]).\nThe first is the method of field theory. Based on the principles of quantum field theory \u2013\nquantum chromodynamics (QCD) \u2013 it is rightly regarded as the most consistent approach to\nthe solution of this problem. However, standard perturbative QCD gives sufficiently reliable\ncomputational prescriptions only for the description of so\u2013called \"hard\" processes, which\nare characterized by large momentum transfers, and it does not permit the calculation of\ncharacteristics determined by \"soft\" processes. Moreover, there are strong indications that\nperturbative QCD is not valid for the description of the currently existing experimental\nfacts in exclusive processes. This applies, in particular, to the description of the elastic form\nfactors of such well\u2013studied composite systems as pion, nucleon and deuteron.\nThe second method in the relativistic theory of composite systems that is gaining acceptance in recent years is based on the direct realization of the algebra of the Poincar\u00e9 group\non the set of dynamical observables on the Hilbert state space of the system. This approach\nis called the theory of direct interaction, or relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics (RHD). The\ndiscussion of this approach can be found e.g. in [2, 3].\nThe method is based on the quite different starting positions than the first one. It is one\nof the reasons why the results of these approaches are difficult to compare. We shall not\nfocus ourselves on the details of RHD but we refer reader to the paper [4] and references\ntherein.\nAlthough the above-mentioned methods of the description of composite systems are different enough, it is necessary to solve in both cases three highly important problems.\n1) It is necessary to give the relativistic recipe for taking into account the nonperturbative\neffects. Notice that in the case of RHD, in the framework of which we shall operate, these\neffects are contained in the structure of method directly [1, 4].\n2) It is necessary to construct the matrix element of electroweak current with correct\ntransformation properties and to perform the procedure of the relativistic parametrization\nof matrix elements that is to extract the relativistic invariant form factors.\n3) It is necessary to take into account the fact that the form factors of composite systems have, generally speaking, the sense of distributions(generalized functions), even in the\nnonrelativistic case.\nIn simple cases the parametrization can be obtained with reasonable facility from general\nconsiderations. However, in more complicated cases, for example, in the case of composite\nsystems with arbitrary total angular momentum one needs a special mathematical method.\nThe aim of the present paper is the construction of a general parametrization method for\n2\n\n\fthe case of composite systems with nonzero values of total spin.\nThe method was announced in our brief report [5]. Now we shall give the consistent\npresentation of our method which makes it possible to apply it to the specific composite\nsystems. Our method is similar in some sense to the method of canonical parametrization of\none-particle matrix elements of field operators [6]. It should be particularly emphasized that\nwe are dealing now with relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics rather than with field theory as\nin Ref. [6].\nConceptually, our method of parametrization is a realization of the Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem for the Poincar\u00e9 group and form factors are the reduced matrix elements. This theorem\nis used extensively in the different fields of theoretical and mathematical physics from well\nknown theory of angular momentum to the Hopf algebras and quantum superalgebras [7].\nIn the present paper we use the term \u2013 generalized Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem for the\nPoincar\u00e9 group \u2013 when form factors of composite systems are considered as generalized\nfunctions. The necessity of such consideration was shown in Refs. [1, 4] in the study of form\nfactors of composite systems with zero total spin.\nThe paper is organized as follows.\nIn Sec.II the canonical parametrization of local operator matrix elements between one\u2013\nparticle states of arbitrary nonzero spin is described. This parametrization presents the\nextraction of the reduced matrix element on the Poincar\u00e9 group. The electromagnetic current\nmatrix element is derived for the spin 1/2 particle.\nIn Sec.III we show how to construct the electromagnetic current operator for composite\nsystem of two free particles of spin 1/2. The current matrix element is obtained in the basis\nwhere the center\u2013of\u2013mass motion is separated. The electromagnetic properties of the system\nare defined by reduced matrix elements, or the so called free two\u2013particle form factors, these\nform factors being generalized functions. This means that, for example, the static properties\nof the system are given by the weak limits as Q2 \u2192 0 (Q2 = \u2212q 2 , q is the momentum\ntransfer). A special attention is paid to the case of total spin one and zero total orbital\nmomentum. In this case the electromagnetic properties are defined by four free two\u2013particle\nform factors \u2013 charge, quadrupole, magnetic and the magnetic quadrupole form factor of the\nsecond kind (see the review [8] and the references therein).\nIn Sec.IV the procedure of the construction of the electromagnetic current matrix element is developed for the case of two interacting particles. Each step of the calculation in\nthe developed method remains Lorentz covariant and conserves the current. The composite system form factors are derived as some integral representations in terms of the wave\nfunctions obtained in the frame of RHD.\nIn Sec.V the results are summarized and the conclusion is given.\n\n2\n\nParametrization of one\u2013particle operator matrix elements\n\nLet us describe now a general method of canonical parameterization of local operator matrix\nelements. In the present paper we are dealing with the matrix elements diagonal in total\nangular momentum only.\nThe main idea of the parametrization can be formulated as follows. Using the variables\nentering the state vectors which define the matrix elements one has to construct two types\nof objects.\n3\n\n\f1. A set of linearly independent matrices which are Lorentz scalars (scalars or pseudoscalars). This set describes transition matrix elements non-diagonal in spin projections\nin the initial and finite states, as well as the properties defined by the discrete space\u2013time\ntransformations.\n2. A set of linearly independent objects with the same tensor dimension as the operator under consideration (for example, four\u2013vector, or four\u2013tensor of some rank). This set\ndescribes the matrix element behavior under the action of Lorentz group transformations.\nThe operator matrix element is written as a sum of all possible objects of the first type\nmultiplied by all possible objects of the second type. The coefficients in this representation\nas a sum are just the reduced matrix elements \u2013 form factors.\nThe obtained representation is then modified with the use of additional conditions for\nthe operator, such as the conservation laws, for example. In order to satisfy these additional\nconditions in some cases some of the coefficients (form factors) occur to be zero.\nTo demonstrate this let us consider the parameterization of the matrix elements taken\nbetween the states of a free particle of mass M in different simple cases. Let us normalize\nthe state vectors as follows:\n(1)\nh~p , m | ~p \u2032 , m\u2032 i = 2p0 \u03b4(~p \u2212 p~ \u2032 ) \u03b4mm\u2032 ,\n\u221a\nhere p~ , p~ \u2032 are three\u2013momenta of particle,p0 = M 2 + p~ 2 , m , m\u2032 are spin projections.\nLet us consider first the parameterization of the matrix element of scalar operator A(x)\ntaken between the states of free particle with zero spin. Because of translation invariance it\nis sufficient to consider A(0). Using the variables of state vectors in the initial and final states\none can construct two linearly independent scalars: p2 = p\u2032 2 = M 2 , (p \u2212 p\u2032 )2 = q 2 = \u2212Q2 .\nOnly the second one \u2013 the momentum transfer square \u2013 is nontrivial. Ignoring the trivial\ndependence on M we can write:\nh ~p, M|A(0)| ~p \u2032 , M i = f (Q2 ) .\n\n(2)\n\nLet us consider now the matrix element of a scalar operator between the states of a\nparticle with spin j:\nh ~p, M, j, m |A(0)| ~p \u2032 , M, j, m\u2032 i .\n(3)\nThe tensor dimension of the operator is not changed, nevertheless, the matrix element is\nnow a matrix in spin projections in the initial and finite states.\nLet us construct the set of Lorentz scalars \u2013 linearly independent matrices in spin projections to be used for the construction of the representation of Eq. (3). Let us use the\ncovariant spin operator \u0393\u03bc (p). In the rest frame this operator coincides with the particle\nspin operator:\n\u03930 (0) = 0 , ~\u0393(0) = M ~j , [ ji , jk ] = i \u03b5ikl jl .\n(4)\nThe covariant spin operator can be defined with the use of the Pauli-Lubanski vector w \u03bc [9].\nIn terms of matrix elements we have:\n\u0393\u03bcmm\u2032 (p) = h ~p , m|w \u03bc |~p , m\u2032 i = h 0 , m|\u00db \u22121 (\u039bp )w \u03bc \u00db(\u039bp )|0 , m\u2032i =\n= (\u039bp )\u03bc\u03bd h 0 , m|w \u03bd |0 , m\u2032 i = (\u039bp )\u03bc\u03bd \u0393\u03bdmm\u2032 (0) .\n\n(5)\n\nHere \u039bp is the boost for the transformation from the rest frame of the particle to the laboratory frame, \u00db (\u039bp ) is the corresponding representation operator. The matrix \u039bp can be\n4\n\n\fwritten explicitly using the matrix for Lorentz transformation of the vector p\u2032 into the vector\np:\n2\n(p\u03bc + p\u2032 \u03bc )(p\u03bd + p\u2032\u03bd )\n\u039b\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc + 2 p\u03bc p\u2032\u03bd \u2212\n.\n(6)\nM\nM 2 + p\u03bb p\u2032\u03bb\nIn our case \u039bp is given by Eq. (6) with p\u2032 = (M , 0 , 0 , 0).\nUsing the explicit form of \u039bp we obtain:\n\u03930 (p) = (~p~j) ,\n\n~\n~\u0393(p) = M ~j + p~(~pj) ,\np0 + M\n\n\u03932 = \u2212M 2 j(j + 1) .\n\n(7)\n\nAs is known [9], spin transforms under the action of Lorentz group following the so\ncalled little group which is isomorphic to the rotation group, that is the corresponding\ntransformations are realized by the matrices of three dimensional rotations.\nSo, the 4-spin operator is transformed under Lorentz transformations p\u03bc = \u039b\u03bc\u03bd p\u2032 \u03bd in the\nfollowing way:\n\u0393\u03bc (p) = \u039b\u03bc\u03bd D j (p, p\u2032 ) \u0393\u03bd (p\u2032 ) D j (p\u2032 , p) .\n(8)\nUsing Eq. (8) one can show directly that the matrix elements of the operators D j (p, p\u2032 )\u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 )\nand \u0393\u03bc (p)D j (p, p\u2032 ) transformed as 4\u2013pseudovectors, the matrix elements of the operators\nD j (p, p\u2032 )p\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ) and p\u2032\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p)D j (p, p\u2032 ) \u2013 as 4-pseudoscalars.\nWe shall construct the set of linearly independent Lorentz\u2013scalar matrices using the vectors p\u03bc , p\u2032 \u03bc and the pseudovector D j (p, p\u2032 )\u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ). Note, that the pseudovector \u0393\u03bc (p)D j (p, p\u2032 )\ndoes not enter the decomposition, being linearly dependent. One can show this fact using\nthe relation (8) and the explicit form Eq. (6) of \u039b\u03bc\u03bd transforming p\u2032 into p. It is easy to\nobtain:\n)\np\u03bc + p\u2032 \u03bc\n\u03bc\nj\n\u2032\nj\n\u2032\n\u03bc \u2032\n\u03bd \u2032\n\u0393 (p)D (p, p ) = D (p, p ) {\u0393 (p ) \u2212 2\n[p\u03bd \u0393 (p )] .\n(9)\nM + p\u03bc p\u2032 \u03bc\nAs p\u2032 \u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ) = 0, the set in question of linearly independent matrices in spin projections of\nthe initial and the final states giving the set of independent Lorentz scalars is presented by\n2j + 1 quantities:\nD j (p, p\u2032 ) (p\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ))n , n = 0, 1, . . . , 2j .\n(10)\nThe number of linearly independent scalars in Eq. (10) is limited by the fact that the product\nof more than 2j elements \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ) reduces as it is linearly dependent. If n is even, then the\nobtained quantities are scalars, if n is odd then they are pseudoscalars. The current matrix\nelement (3) is represented by the linear combination of these linearly independent Lorenrz\nscalars. The coefficients in this combination fn (Q2 ) are just form factors. These form factors\nare invariant under rotations and so they do not depend on spin projections. So, they depend\nupon only one scalar combination of variables \u2013 the momentum\u2013transfer squared.\nFor self\u2013adjoint operator A(0) a minor modification of the set (10) is necessary: in the\nscalar product in Eq. (10) the factor i appears. So, now the current matrix element (3) can\nbe written in the form:\nh ~p, M, j, m |A(0)| ~p \u2032 , M, j, m\u2032 i =\n=\n\n2j\nX\n\nn=0\n\nj\nX\n\nm\u2032\u2032 =\u2212j\n\nh m|D j (p, p\u2032 )|m\u2032\u2032 ih m\u2032\u2032 |{ip\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 )}n | m\u2032 i fn (Q2 )\n\n(11)\n\nThe obtained operator is self\u2013adjoint. This can be easily shown using the following relation:\np\u2032\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p)D j (p, p\u2032 ) = \u2212D j (p, p\u2032 )p\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 )\n5\n\n(12)\n\n\fIn the case of a scalar operator the values n will be even and for a pseudoscalar they will be\nodd.\nLet us consider now the 4-vector operator j\u03bc (0). To parametrize the matrix element one\nneeds a set of quantities of the appropriate tensor dimension. Using the variables entering\nthe particle state vectors one can construct one pseudovector \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ) and three independent\nvectors:\nK\u03bc = (p \u2212 p\u2032 )\u03bc = q\u03bc , K\u03bc\u2032 = (p + p\u2032 )\u03bc , R\u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc \u03bd \u03bb \u03c1 p\u03bd p\u2032 \u03bb \u0393\u03c1 (p\u2032 ) .\n(13)\nHere \u01eb\u03bc \u03bd \u03bb \u03c1 is a completely anti-symmetric pseudo-tensor in four dimensional space-time with\n\u01eb0 1 2 3 = \u22121.\nThe operator matrix element contains the matrix elements of the listed quantities multiplied by D j (p, p\u2032 ) from the left. Each of such products is to be multiplied by the sum of\nlinearly independent scalars constructed while obtaining the parameterization(11):\nh ~p, M, j, m |j\u03bc (0)| ~p \u2032 , M, j, m\u2032 i =\n=\n\nX\nm\u2032\u2032\n\nh m|D j (p, p\u2032 )|m\u2032\u2032 ih m\u2032\u2032 | F1 K\u03bc\u2032 + F2 \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ) + F3 R\u03bc + F4 K\u03bc |m\u2032 i ,\n\nwhere\nFi =\n\n2j\nX\n\nfin (Q2 )(ip\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ))n .\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nn=0\n\nLet us impose some additional conditions on the operator.\n1. Let us require the operator to be self\u2013adjoint.\nOne can check this condition by use of Eq. (12). In the right\u2013hand side (r.h.s.) of\nEq. (14) we need to modify slightly the vector multiplied by F2 . The new vector is a linear\ncombination of the 4\u2013vectors entering Eq. (14) and has the following form:\n\u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ) \u2192 \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 ) \u2212\n\nK\u2032 \u03bc\n(p\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 )) .\nK \u20322\n\n(16)\n\nThe terms containing F2 and F3 are modified in the following way:\nFi A\u03bc \u2192\n\n1\n(Fi A\u03bc + A\u03bc Fi ) = {Fi A\u03bc }+ ,\n2\n\ni = 2, 3 .\n\n(17)\n\nHere A\u03bc are the vectors entering Eq. (14) and changed following Eq. (16). The terms\ncontaining F3 and F4 have to be multiplied by i.\n2. It is useful to modify the parametrization so as to make the vectors \u2013 multipliers of\nFi \u2013 orthogonal to each other.\nThis results in the following form of the vector multiplied by F2 (16):\nK\u2032 \u03bc K \u03bc\n+ 2 (p\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032 )) .\n\u0393 (p ) \u2212\nK\nK \u20322\n\u03bc\n\n!\n\n\u2032\n\n(18)\n\n3. Let us impose the condition of parity conservation.\nThis condition is satisfied if all the terms in the sum (15) contain an even number of\npseudovector factors \u0393\u03bc . So, the sums in F1 and F4 are over even n : 2j \u2265 n \u2265 0, in F3\nover even n : 2j \u2212 1 \u2265 n \u2265 0, and in F2 over odd n : 2j \u2212 1 \u2265 n > 0.\n4. Let us impose the conservation condition j\u03bc K \u03bc = j\u03bc q \u03bc = 0.\nIt is easy to see that this condition is satisfied only if F4 = 0.\n6\n\n\fSo, finally we have the following parametrization of the matrix element:\nh ~p, M, j, m |j\u03bc (0)| ~p \u2032 , M, j, m\u2032 i =\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u00d7hm\n\n| F1K\u03bc\u2032\n\nX\nm\u2032\u2032\n\nh m|D j (p, p\u2032 )|m\u2032\u2032 i\u00d7\n\nK\u03bc\u2032\nK\u03bc\n+ {F2 [\u0393\u03bc (p ) \u2212(p\u03bc \u0393 (p ))\n2 +\n\u2032\nK2\nK\n\u03bc\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n!#)\n\n+\n\n+ i {F3 R\u03bc }+ |m\u2032 i,\n\n(19)\n\nThis construction can be used, for example, to obtain the electromagnetic current matrix\nelement in the case of particle with spin 1/2.\nNow let us list the conditions for the electromagnetic current operator to be fulfilled in\nrelativistic case (see Ref. [4] and the references therein).\n1. Lorentz covariance:\n\u00db \u22121 (\u039b)\u0135 \u03bc (x)\u00db (\u039b) = \u039b\u03bc\u03bd \u0135 \u03bd (\u039b\u22121 x) .\n\n(20)\n\nHere \u039b is a Lorentz\u2013transformation matrix, \u00db (\u039b) is an operator of the unitary representation\nof the Lorentz group.\n2. Invariance under translation:\n\u00db \u22121 (a)\u0135 \u03bc (x)\u00db (a) = \u0135 \u03bc (x \u2212 a) .\n\n(21)\n\nHere \u00db (a) is an operator of unitary representation of the translation group.\n3. Current conservation law:\n[ P\u0302\u03bd \u0135 \u03bd (0) ] = 0 .\n\n(22)\n\nIn terms of matrix elements h \u0135 \u03bc i the conservation law can be written in the following form:\nq\u03bc h \u0135 \u03bc (0) i = 0 .\n\n(23)\n\nHere q\u03bc is four-vector of the momentum transfer.\n4. Current\u2013operator transformations under space\u2013time reflections:\n\u00dbP\n\n\u0012\n\n\u02c6\n\u0135 (x , ~x) , ~j(x0 , ~x) \u00dbP\u22121 =\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u02c6\n\u0135 (x , \u2212 ~x) , \u2212 ~j(x0 , \u2212 ~x)\n0\n\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u00dbR \u0135 \u03bc (x) \u00dbR\u22121 = \u0135 \u03bc (\u2212 x) .\n\n(24)\n\nIn Eq. (24) \u00dbP is the unitary operator for the representation of space reflections and \u00dbR is\nthe anti-unitary operator of the representation of space-time reflections R = P T .\nOur parametrization satisfies all the conditions listed above. The parametrization (19)\nfor the electromagnetic current in the case of particle with spin 1/2 has the following form:\nh ~p, M,\n=\n\nX\nm\u2032\u2032\n\n1\n1\n, m | j\u03bc (0) | ~p \u2032 , M, , m\u2032 i =\n2\n2\n\nh m|D 1/2 (p, p\u2032 )|m\u2032\u2032 ih m\u2032\u2032 | f10 (Q2 ) K\u03bc\u2032 + if30 (Q2 ) R\u03bc |m\u2032 i ,\n\n(25)\n\nThe form factors f10 (Q2 ) = f1 (Q2 ) and f30 (Q2 ) = f2 (Q2 ) are the electric and the magnetic\nform factors of the particle, respectively. In analogous way (although a little more cumbersome) one can obtain the matrix elements of the operators of higher tensor dimension.\n7\n\n\f3\n\nParametrization of matrix elements of two\u2013particle\nelectromagnetic current operator\n\nTo describe the properties of the system of interacting constituents in our approach it is\nnecessary to have the reduced matrix elements on Poincar\u00e9 group (the form factors) which\ndescribe the properties of the composite system of free constituents. In this section we\ngeneralize the method of parametrization of the previous section to the case of such free\nsystems.\nLet us consider a system of two free particles with spins 1/2 and let us parametrize the\nmatrix element describing the transitions in this system. Let us construct, for example, the\nelectromagnetic current operator matrix element. The matrix element can be taken between\nthe following two\u2013particle state vectors:\n| ~p1 , m1 ; p~2 , m2 i = | ~p1 , m1 i \u2297 | ~p2 , m2 i .\n\n(26)\n\nHere p~1 , ~p2 are three\u2013momenta of particles, m1 , m2 are spin projections on the z axis. The\none\u2013particle state vectors are normalized by Eq. (1).\nAs well as the basis (26) one can choose another set of two-particle state vectors where\nthe motion of the two-particle center of mass is separated:\n\u221a\n~ , s, J, l, S, mJ i ,\n|P\n\u221a\n\u221a\nh P~ , s, J, l, S, mJ | P~ \u2032 , s\u2032 , J \u2032 , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , mJ \u2032 i =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= NCG \u03b4 (3) (P~ \u2212 P~ \u2032 )\u03b4( s \u2212 s\u2032 )\u03b4JJ \u2032 \u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4SS \u2032 \u03b4mJ mJ \u2032 ,\n(27)\nq\n\n\u03bb(s , M12 , M22 )\n(2P0 )2\n\u221a , k=\n\u221a\n,\nNCG =\n8k s\n2 s\n\u221a\nhere P\u03bc = (p1 + p2 )\u03bc , P\u03bc2 = s, s is the invariant mass of the two-particle system, l is the\norbital angular momentum in the center\u2013of\u2013mass frame (c.m.), S is the total spin in the\nc.m., J is the total angular momentum with the projection mJ ; M1 , M2 are the constituent\nmasses, and \u03bb(a, b, c) = a2 + b2 + c2 \u2212 2(ab + bc + ac).\nThe basis (27) is connected with the basis (26) through the Clebsh\u2013Gordan decomposition\nfor the Poincar\u00e9 group. Here we write the decomposition in a little more general form than\nin Ref. [4]:\n\u221a\n| P~ , s, J, l, S, mJ i =\n=\n\nX Z\n\nm1 m2\n\n\u221a\nd~p1 d~p2\n~ , s, J, l, S, mJ i ,\n| ~p1 , m1 ; ~p2 , m2 ih ~p1 , m1 ; ~p2 , m2 | P\n2p10 2p20\n\n(28)\n\nwhere\nh ~p1 , m1 ; ~p2 , m2 | P~ ,\n\u00d7\n\n\u221a\n\nX\n\n\u00d7h\n\ns, J, l, S, mJ i =\n\n\u221a\n\n2s[\u03bb(s, M12 , M22 )]\u22121/2 2P0 \u03b4(P \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 )\u00d7\n\nh m1 | D 1/2 (p1 , P ) |m\u03031 ih m2| D 1/2 (p2 , P ) |m\u03032 i\u00d7\n\n11\nm\u03031 m\u03032 |S mS i Ylml (\u03b8 , \u03c6) hS l ms ml |JmJ i .\n22\n\n8\n\n\fHere \u03b8 , \u03c6 are the spherical angles of the vector p~ = (~p1 \u2212 ~p2 )/2 in the c.m., Ylml (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nare spherical harmonics, h1/2 1/2 m\u03031 m\u03032 |S mS i , hS l ms ml |JmJ i are Clebsh\u2013Gordan coefficients for the group SU(2), D j are the known rotation matrices to be used for correct\nrelativistic invariant spin addition, the summation is over m\u03031 , m\u03032 , ml , mS .\nThe decomposition in spherical harmonics and angular momenta summation in Eq. (28)\nare performed in the c.m. and the result is shifted to an arbitrary frame by use of D\u2013\nfunctions.\nThe electromagnetic current matrix element for the system of two free particles taken in\nthe basis (26) can be written as a sum of the one\u2013particle current matrix elements:\nh~p1 , m1 ; ~p2 , m2 |j\u03bc(0) (0)|~p \u20321 , m\u20321 ; ~p \u20322 , m\u20322 i =\n= h~p2 , m2 |~p \u20322 , m\u20322 ih~p1 , m1 |j1\u03bc (0)|~p \u20321 , m\u20321 i + (1 \u2194 2) .\n\n(29)\n\nEach of the one\u2013particle current matrix elements in Eq. (29) can be written in terms of form\nfactors as in Section II. In the case of the particles with spin 1/2 we make use of Eq.(25).\nSo, in this case the electromagnetic properties of the system are defined by the form factors\nf1 , f2 .\nNow let us construct the electromagnetic current matrix element for the system of two\nfree particles in the basis (27) following the previous Section. Let us consider first a simple\ncase J = J \u2032 = S = S \u2032 = l = l\u2032 = 0. (We omit these variables in the state vectors.)\nThis set of quantum numbers appears, for example, in the case of pion [4]. Now there is\nno pseudovector \u0393\u03bc , but along with the scalar (P \u2212 P \u2032 )2 = \u2212 Q2 two additional nontrivial\nscalars do appear s\u2032 = P \u2032 2 and s = P 2 \u2013 the invariant mass squares for the free two\u2013particle\nsystem in the initial and in the final states. So, the form factors entering the parametrization\nare functions of the variables Q2 , s , s\u2032 . The current matrix element is presented by the\nlinear combination of the four\u2013vectors P\u03bc and P\u03bc\u2032 :\n\u221a\n\u221a\nhP~ , s | j\u03bc(0) (0) | P~ \u2032 , s\u2032 i = (P\u03bc + P\u03bc\u2032 ) g1 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) + (P\u03bc \u2212 P\u03bc\u2032 ) g2(s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) .\n\n(30)\n\nMaking use of the conservation condition (23)\nj\u03bc(0) (0)(P \u2212 P \u2032)\u03bc = 0 ,\nwe can write the parametrization in the form:\n\u221a\n\u221a\nhP~ , s | j\u03bc(0) (0) | P~ \u2032 , s\u2032 i = A\u03bc (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) g0 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) .\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\nHere g0 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) is the reduced matrix element. We will refer to this invariant as to the free\ntwo\u2013particle form factor. The vector A\u03bc (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) is defined by the current transformation\nproperties (the Lorentz covariance and the conservation law):\nA\u03bc (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) = (1/Q2 )[(s \u2212 s\u2032 + Q2 )P\u03bc + (s\u2032 \u2212 s + Q2 )P \u2032\u03bc ] .\n\n(33)\n\nThe free two\u2013particle form factor can be expressed in terms of the one\u2013particle form\nfactors (25). To do this one has to perform in Eq. (32) the Clebsh\u2013Gordan decomposition of\nthe irreducible representation (27) into the direct product of two irreducible representations\n(26), (28) and to take into account Eqs. (25), (29). As the form factors are invariants one\ncan perform the integration in Eq. (32) in the coordinate frame with P~ \u2032 = 0 , P~ = (0, 0, P ).\n9\n\n\fThe explicit form of g0 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) in the case of two particles with spin 1/2 and mass M can\nbe found in Ref. [4].\nLet us perform the analogous parameterization for the set of quantum numbers in the\nbasis (27) in the case J , J \u2032 6= 0. In the following, we will take J = J \u2032 .\nThe Lorentz covariant properties of the matrix element are defined (in analogy with\nEq. (13)) by three 4\u2013vectors and one pseudovector:\nK\u03bc = (P \u2212 P \u2032)\u03bc , R\u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 P \u03bd P \u2032\u03bb \u0393\u03c1 (P \u2032 ) ,\n\nK\u03bc\u2032 = (P + P \u2032 )\u03bc ,\n\n\u0393\u03bc (P \u2032 ) .\n\n(34)\n\nThe pseudovector \u0393\u03bc (P ) does not enter the parametrization because it can be expressed\nthrough \u0393\u03bc (P \u2032 ) by the equation analogous to Eq. (9):\n\uf8fc\n\u221a\n(\n\u221a \u2032\n\u2032P +\n\uf8fd\ns\ns\nP\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n\u221a \u03bc [P\u03bd \u0393\u03bd (P \u2032 )] .\n\u221a \u0393(P )\u03bc D j (P, P \u2032) = D j (P, P \u2032) \u221a \u0393\u03bc (P \u2032) \u2212 \u221a *\n\uf8fe\ns\ns\u2032\nss\u2032 P\u03bd P \u2032 \u03bd + ss\u2032\n\nThe set of linearly independent matrices to be used for the decomposition of the current\nmatrix element is obtained from the vectors P\u03bc and \u0393\u03bc (P \u2032 ) following Eq.

In this case the functions Fill SS in Eq. (38) have the\nfollowing form (compare to Eqs. (15), (19)):\nF1 = f10 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) + f12 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 )(iP\u03bd \u0393\u03bd (P \u2032))2 ,\nF2 = f21 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) (i P\u03bd \u0393\u03bd (P \u2032)) ,\n\nF3 = f30 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) .\n\n(40)\n\nIn equations (40) the fixed variables l, l\u2032 , S, S \u2032 are omitted. Time reflection invariance imposes\nthe additional conditions:\n\u2217\nfin\n= fin ,\n\ni = 1, 3 ;\n\n\u2217\nf21\n= \u2212 f21 .\n\n(41)\n\ni = 1, 3 ;\n\nf21 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) = \u2212 f21 (s\u2032 , Q2 , s) .\n\n(42)\n\nWith Eqs. (39) and (41) we obtain\nfin (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) = fin (s\u2032 , Q2 , s) ,\n\nThe relation (42) demonstrates that the form factor f21 appears in the parametrization as\na consequence of the fact that the invariant masses in the initial and the final states are\ndifferent. As will be seen below, this form factor gives no contribution to elastic processes,\nfor example, to the electron scattering by the composite particle, however, it does contribute\nto radiative transitions.\nLet us rewrite Eq. (40) in terms of standard form factors instead of fin :\nn\n\nF1 = g0C (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) + g0Q (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) (iP\u03bd \u0393\u03bd (P \u2032 ))2 \u2212(1/3) Sp(iP\u03bd \u0393\u03bd (P \u2032 ))2\nF2 = g0M Q (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) (i P\u03bd \u0393\u03bd (P \u2032 )) ,\n\no\n\n2\n,\nSp(P\u03bd \u0393\u03bd (P \u2032 ))2\n\nF3 = g0M (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) .\n\n(43)\n\nThe scalar factor in the term with g0Q is chosen in such a way as to make it possible to\ninterpret g0Q as a quadrupole form factor of the system of two free particles. In other terms\ng0C is the charge form factor, g0M Q = f21 is the magnetic quadrupole form factor of the\nsecond kind, its classical analog being the so called toroidal magnetic moment [8], g0M = f30\nis the magnetic form factor of the free two\u2013 particle system.\nIn the same way as in the case of Eq. (32) the free two\u2013particle form factors in Eq. (43)\ncan be written in terms of the constituent form factors (see Ref. [4] for details). The\ncorresponding equations are rather complicated, so we do not present it here.\nThe free two\u2013particle form factors in Eqs. (32), (36), (40) are to be considered in the\nsense of distributions. For example, g0 (s , Q2 , s\u2032 ) has to be interpreted as a Lorentz invariant\nregular generalized function on the space of test functions S(R2 ) [10].\nLet us define the functional giving the regular generalized function as\nh g0 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) , \u03c6(s, s\u2032)i =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bc(s, s\u2032) g0 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) \u03c6(s, s\u2032) .\n\n(44)\n\nHere\n\u221a\n4\nd\u03bc(s, s\u2032 ) = 16 \u03b8(s \u2212 4M 2 ) \u03b8(s\u2032 \u2212 4M 2 ) ss\u2032 d\u03bc(s) d\u03bc(s\u2032) ,\n11\n\n1 \u221a\nd\u03bc(s) = k d s .\n4\n\n(45)\n\n\fThe quantity Q2 is a parameter of the generalized function, M1 = M2 = M. The function\n\u03b8(x) is the step function.\n\u03c6(s , s\u2032 ) is a function from the space of test functions. So, for example, the limit as\n2\nQ \u2192 0 (the static limit) in g0 (s , Q2 , s\u2032 ) (32) exists only in the weak sense as the limit of\nthe functional:\nlim\nh g0 , \u03c6 i = h(eq + eq\u0304 )\u03b4(\u03bc(s\u2032) \u2212 \u03bc(s)), \u03c6 i .\n(46)\n2\nQ \u21920\n\neq and eq\u0304 are the constituent charges, \u03b4 is the Dirac delta\u2013function.\nIt is just the limit in the sense (46) that gives the electric charge of the free two\u2013particle\nsystem. The ordinary point\u2013wise limit of the form factor g0 as Q2 \u21920 is zero. The equations\nanalogous to Eq. (46) are valid for the static limits of the free two\u2013particle form factors in\nEqs. (43), too.\nLet us note that the conditions imposed on the free two\u2013particle form factors that follow\nfrom the conditions for the electromagnetic current operator (39), and (42) have to be\nconsidered in the weak sense, too.\n\n4\n\nParameterization of the current operator matrix elements for systems of two interacting particles\n\nIn this Section we generalize the parameterization method of the previous sections to the\ncase of composite system with the structure defined by the interaction of its constituents.\nLet us consider the operator j\u03bc (0) that describes a transition between two states of a\ncomposite two\u2013 constituent system, j\u03bc (0) being diagonal in the total angular momentum.\nLet us neglect temporarily the additional conditions of self\u2013adjointness, parity conservation\netc. in the same way as when constructing the matrix elements (14) in Section II. The\nWigner\u2013Eckart decomposition of the matrix element has the form (14), (15). To emphasize\nthe fact that the particle is composite, let us rewrite Eqs. (14), (15) using new notations:\nh ~pc , mJc |j\u03bc (0)| ~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\nh\n\n= h mJc |D Jc (pc , p\u2032c ) F1c K\u03bc\u2032 + F2c \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032c ) +F3c R\u03bc + F4c K\u03bc ] |m\u2032Jc i ,\nhere\nFic\n\n=\n\n2Jc\nX\n\nc\nfin\n(Q2 )(ipc\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032c ))n .\n\n(47)\n(48)\n\nn=0\n\nIn Eqs. (47), and (48) (pc \u2212p\u2032c )2 = \u2212 Q2 , p2c\u03bc = p\u2032c\u03bc 2 = Mc2 , Mc is the mass of the composite\nparticle. In contrast to Eq. (14) spins and masses are omitted in the state vector variables.\nc\nIn the frame of RHD the form factors of composite systemsfin\nare to be expressed in\nterms of RHD wave functions\nIn RHD a state of two particle interacting system is described by a vector in the direct\nproduct of two one\u2013particle Hilbert spaces (see, e.g., Ref. [4]). So, the matrix element in\nRHD can be decomposed in the basis (27):\nh~pc , mJc |j\u03bc (0)|~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\nXZ\n\n\u221a\ndP~ dP~ \u2032 \u221a \u221a \u2032\nd s d s h ~pc , mJc |P~ , s , J , l , S , mJ i\u00d7\n\u2032\nNCG NCG\n12\n\n\f\u221a\ns , J , l , S , mJ |j\u03bc (0)|P~ \u2032 , s\u2032 , J \u2032 , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , mJ \u2032 i\u00d7\n\u221a\n\u00d7 hP~ \u2032 , s\u2032 , J \u2032 , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , mJ \u2032 |~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i .\n(49)\n\u221a\nHere the sum is over variables J,J \u2032 ,l,l\u2032 ,S,S \u2032 ,mJ ,mJ \u2032 , and hP~ \u2032 , s\u2032 J \u2032 , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , m\u2032J |~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i is\nthe wave function in the sense of the instant form of RHD.\nLet us write the wave function in the form slightly more general than in Ref.

(47), and (48) let us write the Wigner\u2013Eckart\ndecomposition on the Poincar\u00e9 group for the current matrix element in the r.h.s. of Eq. (49).\nHowever, now there are some difficulties.\nThe point is that in the previous sections we were dealing with the parametrization of\nlocal operator matrix elements in the case when the transformations of the state vectors and\nof the operators were defined by one and the same representation of the quantum mechanical\nPoincar\u00e9 group. While describing the composite systems in RHD a different situation can\narise when the state vectors and the operator under consideration are transformed following\ndifferent representations of this group.\nIt is just such a situation that takes place in the case of the matrix element in the r.h.s. of\nEq. (49). The operator in the matrix element describes the system of two interacting particles\nand transforms following the representation with Lorentz boosts generators depending on\nthe interaction [4]. The state vectors physically describe the system of two free particles\nand present the basis of a representation with interaction\u2013independent generators. So, the\nWigner\u2013Eckart decomposition in the form used in Section II can not be applied directly to\nthe matrix element in the integrand in the r.h.s. of Eq. (49). This is caused by the fact that it\nis impossible to construct 4\u2013vectors describing the matrix element transformation properties\nunder the action of Lorentz boosts from the variables entering the state vectors (contrary\nto the case of, e.g., Eq. (47)). In fact, the possibility of matrix element representation in\nthe form (47) is based on the following fact. Let us act by Lorentz transformation on the\noperator:\n\u00db \u22121 (\u039b)j \u03bc (0)\u00db(\u039b) = j\u0303 \u03bc (0) .\n(53)\nWe obtain the following chain of equalities:\nh~pc , mJc |j\u0303 \u03bc (0)|~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i = h~pc , mJc |\u00db \u22121 (\u039b)j \u03bc (0)\u00db(\u039b)|~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\n13\n\n\f=\n\nX\n\nm\u0303J c ,m\u0303\u2032J c\n\nh mJc |[D Jc (R\u039b )]\u22121 | m\u0303Jc ih\u039b~pc , m\u0303Jc |j \u03bc (0)|\u039b~pc \u2032 , m\u0303\u2032Jc ih m\u0303\u2032Jc |D Jc (R\u039b )| m\u2032Jc i.\n\n(54)\n\nHere D Jc (R\u039b ) is rotation matrix realizing the angular momentum transformation under\nthe action of Lorentz transformations. The equalities (54) show that the transformation\nproperties of the current as a 4\u2013vector (20) can be described using the 4\u2013vectors of the\ninitial and the final states. This means that the procedure of the canonical parameterization\ncan be extended to the matrix element for the realization of the Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem on\nthe Poincar\u00e9 group.\nIn the case of the current matrix element in the r.h.s. of Eq. (49) the relations (54) are\nnot valid and direct application of the Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem is impossible.\nHowever, it can be shown that for the matrix element in Eq. (49) considered as a generalized function (that is considered as an object having sense only under integrals and sums\nin Eq. (49)), the equality (54) is valid in the weak sense.\nLet us consider the matrix element in question as a regular Lorentz covariant generalized\nfunction (see, e.g., Ref. [10]). Using Eq. (50) let us rewrite Eq. (49) in the following form:\nh~pc , mJc |j\u03bc (0)|~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\n\nX Z\n\nl,l\u2032 ,S,S \u2032\n\n\u221a \u221a\nNc Nc\u2032\n\u2032\nJc\nd s d s\u2032 \u03c6Jc\nlS (s)\u03c6l\u2032 S \u2032 (s )\u00d7\n\u2032\nNCG NCG\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u00d7 h~pc , s , Jc , l , S , mJc |j\u03bc (0)|~pc \u2032 , s\u2032 , Jc , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i .\n\n(55)\n\nHere it is taken into account that the current operator j\u03bc (0) is diagonal in total angular\nmomentum of the composite system.\nLet us make use of the fact that the set of the states (27) is complete in RHD:\nI\u02c6 =\n\nXZ\n\n\u221a\ndP~ \u221a ~ \u221a\nd s |P , s , J , l , S , mJ ihP~ , s , J , l , S , mJ | .\nNCG\n\n(56)\n\nHere the sum is over all the discrete variables of the basis (27).\nUnder the integral the matrix element of the transformed current satisfies the following\nchain of equalities ((50) and (56) are taken into account):\n\u221a \u221a \u2032 Jc\nNc Nc\u2032\n\u2032\ns d s \u03c6lS (s)\u03c6Jc\nd\nl\u2032 S \u2032 (s )\u00d7\n\u2032\nNCG NCG\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u00d7h~pc , s , Jc , l , S , mJc |\u00db \u22121 (\u039b)j\u03bc (0)\u00db (\u039b)|~pc \u2032 , s\u2032 , Jc , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\nXZ\n\n= h ~pc , mJc |\u00db \u22121 (\u039b) I\u02c6 j\u03bc (0) I\u02c6 \u00db (\u039b)| ~pc \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\n\n=\n\nX\n\nm\u0303J c ,m\u0303\u2032J c\n\nh mJc |[D Jc (R\u039b )]\u22121 | m\u0303Jc ih\u039b~pc , m\u0303Jc |I\u02c6 j \u03bc (0)I\u02c6 |\u039b~pc \u2032 , m\u0303\u2032Jc ih m\u0303\u2032Jc |D Jc (R\u039b )| m\u2032Jc i =\n\nX\n\u221a \u221a \u2032 Jc\nNc Nc\u2032\n\u2032\nJc\nd\ns\nd\ns\n\u03c6\n(s)\u03c6\nh mJc |[D Jc (R\u039b )]\u22121 | m\u0303Jc i\u00d7\n\u2032 S \u2032 (s )\nlS\nl\n\u2032\nNCG NCG\nm\u0303J c ,m\u0303\u2032J c\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u00d7 h\u039b~pc , s , Jc , l , S , m\u0303Jc |j\u03bc (0)|\u039b~pc \u2032 , s\u2032 , Jc , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , m\u0303\u2032Jc ih m\u0303\u2032Jc |D Jc (R\u039b )| m\u2032Jc i .\n\n=\n\nXZ\n\n(57)\n\nIt is easy to see that under the integral the current matrix element satisfies the equalities\nanalogous to Eq. (54), so now it is possible to use the parameterization method of the\nprevious sections under the integral, that is to use the Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem in the weak\nsense.\n14\n\n\fThe next step is a parameterization of the matrix element in the r.h.s. of Eq.

Then the obtained expression is a functional\nin R6 .\nThe functional in the r.h.s. of Eq. (59) defines a Lorentz covariant generalized function, generated by the current operator matrix element. The integral in Eq. (59) converges\nuniformly due to the definition (58).\nTaking into account Eq. (57) we decompose the matrix element in the r.h.s. of Eq. (59)\ninto the set of linearly independent scalars entering the r.h.s. of Eq.(47):\n\u221a\n\u221a\nNc Nc\u2032\n\u2032\nh~\np\n,\ns,\nJ\n,\nl,\nS,\nm\n|j\n(0)|~\np\n,\ns\u2032 , Jc , l\u2032 , S \u2032, m\u2032Jc i =\nc\nc\nJc\n\u03bc\nc\n\u2032\nNCG NCG\n= h mJc |D\n\u2032\n\nJc\n\n(pc , p\u2032c )\n\n2Jc\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(ipc\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032c ))n Alln\u03bcSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032 )|m\u2032Jc i,\n\n(61)\n\nn=0\n\n\u2032\n\nHere Alln\u03bcSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) is a Lorentz covariant generalized function.\nTaking into account Eq. (61) and comparing the r.h.s. of Eq. (47) with Eq. (59) we\nobtain:\nX Z\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nd\u03bc(s, s\u2032) \u03c8 ll SS (s, s\u2032 )h mJc |Alln\u03bcSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032) |m\u2032Jc i =\nl,l\u2032 ,S,S \u2032\n\nh\n\nc\nc\nc\nc\n= h mJc | f1n\nK\u03bc\u2032 + f2n\n\u0393\u03bc (p\u2032c ) +f3n\nR\u03bc + f4n\nK\u03bc ] |m\u2032Jc i .\n\n(62)\n\nIt is easy to see that all the form factors in the r.h.s. of Eq. (62) are nonzero if the generalized function A contains parts that are diagonal (A1 ) and non-diagonal (A2 ) in mJc , m\u2032Jc :\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nSS\nSS\nAlln\u03bcSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) = All1n\u03bc\n(s, Q2 , s\u2032) + All2n\u03bc\n(s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) .\n\nFor the diagonal part we have from Eq. (62):\nX Z\n\nl,l\u2032 S,S \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nSS\nd\u03bc(s, s\u2032) \u03c8 ll SS (s, s\u2032 )h mJc |All1n\u03bc\n(s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) |mJc i =\n\n15\n\n(63)\n\n\fh\n\ni\n\nc\nc\n= h mJc | f1n\n[\u03c8] K\u03bc\u2032 + f4n\n[\u03c8] K\u03bc |mJc i .\n\n(64)\n\nc\nThe notation fin\n[\u03c8] in the r.h.s. emphasizes the fact that form factors of composite systems\nare functionals on the wave functions of the intrinsic motion and so, due to Eq. (58), on the\ntest functions.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLet the equality (64) be valid for any test function \u03c8 ll SS (s, s\u2032 ). When the test functions\n(the intrinsic motion wave functions) are changed the vectors in the r.h.s. are not changed\nbecause according to the essence of the parametrization (47) they do not depend on the\nmodel for the particle intrinsic structure. So, when the test functions are varied the vector\nof the r.h.s. of Eq. (64) remains in the hyperplace defined by the vectors K\u03bc , K\u03bc\u2032 .\nWhen test functions are varied arbitrarily the vector in the left\u2013hand side (l.h.s.) of\nEq. (64) can take, in general, an arbitrary direction. So, the requirement of the validity of\nEq. (64) in the whole space of our test functions is that the l.h.s. generalized function should\nhave the form:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nSS\nAll1n\u03bc\n(s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) = K\u03bc\u2032 Gll1nSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032) + K\u03bc Gll4nSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) .\n\u2032\n\n(65)\n\n\u2032\n\nHere GllinSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) , i = 1, 4 are Lorentz invariant generalized functions.\nSubstituting Eq. (65) in Eq. (64) and taking into account Eqs. (51) and (60) we obtain\nthe following integral representations:\nc\nfin\n(Q2 ) =\n\nX Z\n\n\u221e\n\nl,l\u2032 ,S,S \u2032 M1 +M2\n\n\u221a \u221a\n\u2032\nll\u2032 SS \u2032\nd s d s\u2032 \u03c6Jc\n(s, Q2 , s\u2032 )\u03c6Jc\nlS (s) Gin\nl\u2032 S \u2032 (s ) .\n\n(66)\n\nIn the case of matrix element in Eq. (62) non-diagonal in mJc , m\u2032Jc we can proceed in an\nc\nanalogous way and obtain an analogous integral representations for fin\n(Q2 ) , i = 2, 3.\nSo, the matrix element in the r.h.s. of Eq. (59) considered as Lorentz covariant generalized\nfunction can be written as the following decomposition of the type of Wigner\u2013Eckart decomposition:\n\u221a\n\u221a\nh~pc , s , Jc , l , S , mJc |j\u03bc (0)|~pc \u2032 , s\u2032 , Jc , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\n=\n\n\u2032\nh\nNCG NCG\nJc\n\u2032\nh\nm\n|D\n(p\n,\np\n)\nF1 K\u03bc\u2032 + F2 \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032c ) +F3 R\u03bc + F4 K\u03bc ] |m\u2032Jc i .\nJc\nc\nc\nNc Nc\u2032\n\nFi =\n\n2Jc\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nGllinSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032 )(ipc\u03bc \u0393\u03bc (p\u2032c ))n ,\n\n(67)\n(68)\n\nn=0\n\nwith the constraint (66).\nIn Eqs. (67), and (68) the form factors contain all the information about the physics\nof the transition described by the operator j\u03bc (0). They are connected with the composite\nparticle form factors (47), and (48) through Eq. (66). In particular, physical approximations\n\u2032\n\u2032\nare formulated in our approach in terms of form factors GllinSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032) (see Ref. [4] for\ndetails). The matrix element transformation properties are given by the 4\u2013vectors in the\nr.h.s. of Eq. (67).\nIt is worth to emphasize that it is necessary to consider the composite system form factors\n\u2032\n\u2032\nas the functionals generated by the Lorentz invariant generalized functions GllinSS (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ).\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAfter determination of the vectors Alln\u03bcSS (s, t, s\u2032 ) in Eq. (62) let us impose the additional\nconditions on the matrix elements in Eqs. (47), and (62) in the same way as we did in Sec.II\nin Eqs. (16)\u2013(19). The r.h.s. of equalities (47) and (67) contain the same 4\u2013vectors and the\nsame sets of Lorentz scalars (48) and (68), so, to take into account the additional conditions\n16\n\n\fit is necessary to redefine these 4\u2013vectors according to Eqs. (16)\u2013(19). For example, the\nconservation law gives F4 =0. It is easy to see that for the redefined form factors the equality\n(66) remains valid.\nLet us write the parameterization (67), (68) for the particular case of composite particle\nelectromagnetic current with quantum numbers J = J \u2032 = S = S \u2032 = 1, which is realized, for\nexample, in the case of deuteron. Separating the quadrupole form factor in analogy with\nEq. (43) and using Eqs. (67), and (68) we obtain the following form:\n\u221a\n\u221a\nh~pc , s , Jc , l , S , mJc |j\u03bc (0)|~pc \u2032 , s\u2032 , Jc , l\u2032 , S \u2032 , m\u2032Jc i =\n=\nF\u03031 =\n\n\u2032\nNCG NCG\ni\nh mJc | D 1(pc , p\u2032c ) F\u03031 K\u03bc\u2032 +\nF\u03033 R\u03bc |m\u2032Jc i .\n\u2032\nNc Nc\nMc\n\n\u2032\nG\u0303ll10 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 )\n\n\u0014\n\n+\n\n\u2032\nG\u0303ll12 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 )\n\nn\n\n[ipc \u03bd \u0393\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u0015\n\n(p\u2032c )]2\n\n(69)\n\n2\n1\n,\n\u2212 Sp[ipc \u03bd \u0393\u03bd (p\u2032c )]2\n3\nSp[pc \u03bd \u0393\u03bd (p\u2032c )]2\n\u001b\n\n\u2032\n\nF\u03033 = G\u0303ll30 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) .\n\n(70)\n\n\u2032\n\nWe have taken into account that the equation G\u0303ll21 (s, Q2 , s\u2032 ) = 0 is valid in weak sense.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe method of construction of the electromagnetic current matrix elements for the relativistic\ntwo\u2013particle composite systems with nonzero total angular momentum is developed in the\nframe of the instant form of RHD.\nThe method makes use of the Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem on the Poincar\u00e9 group. It enables\none to extract from the matrix elements the reduced matrix elements \u2013 invariant form factors\n\u2013 which in the case of composite systems are generalized functions.\nThe obtained current operator matrix elements satisfy the Lorentz\u2013covariance condition\nand the conservation law.\nThe modified impulse approximation (MIA)- with the physical content of the relativistic\nimpulse approximation - was formulated in Refs.[4, 5] in terms of reduced matrix elements.\nMIA conserves Lorentz covariance of electromagnetic current and the current conservation\nlaw.\nThe developed formalism was used in [11] to obtain a reasonable description of the static\nmoments and the electromagnetic form factors of \u03c1 meson. A number of relativistic effects\nare obtained, for example, the nonzero quadrupole moment (in the case of S state) due\nto the relativistic Wigner spin rotation. In Ref.[12] the tenzor polarization T20 (Q2 ) in the\nelastic ed-scattering was calculated. The good agreement with experiments was obtained,\nespecially for deuteron wave functions from Ref. [13]. These particular results argue for the\nvalidity of our description of the electroweak properties of composite systems with nonzero\ntotal angular momentum.\nThis work was supported in part by the Program \"Russian Universities\u2013Basic Researches\"\n(Grant No. 02.01.013) and Russian Ministry of Education (Grant E02\u2013 3.1\u201334).\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
