However, classical General Relativity (GR) based on\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action\nS=\u2212\n\n1\n\u03ba2\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212gR,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere R is a scalar curvature of space-time, is a nonrenormazible theory.\nThe requirement of renormalizability of the theory of gravity leads to the\nLagrangian with quadratic terms in curvature (R2 theory of gravity) [1]. Although the quantum theory of gravity becomes a renormazible theory, the\nnew difficulty appears - nonunitarity. This fact is connected with higher\nderivative equations of motion. Field equations in R2 theory of gravity are\nforth-derivative equations. Now much attention is paid to higher derivative\nquantum field theories. For example, the higher derivative scalar field theory\nwas considered in [2], and higher derivative fermionic field equations were\ndiscussed in [3], [4]. The nonunitarity is the main obstacle to the consistent\n1\n\n\ftheory of quantum gravity. Possibly this difficulty will be solved by developing more a fundamental unified theory (the theory of everything, M-theory,\nthe string theory, etc.) Originally, GR was applied for macroscopic objects,\nand the energy-momentum tensor of matter is the source of gravitational field\ncharacterized by the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd (the Riemann space-time). But it is\npossible to construct the microscopic theory of gravity where the spin of elementary particles is a source of another characteristic of space-time \u2212torsion.\nTorsion fields are additional degrees of freedom that are independent of metric. This natural extension of gravity is gravity with torsion that is described\nby the Riemann-Cartan space-time U4 [5]. The gravity of macroscopic objects can then be considered by averaging the microscopic equations over all\nvolume. Therefore, we can naturally include torsion fields in the quantum\ntheory of gravity. Torsion fields interact with the spin of particles and may\ncontribute to physical observations.\nIt should be mentioned that the quantum gravity plays a very important\nrole in the investigation of early universe cosmology. In cosmology, there\nare some puzzles such as dark energy, positive cosmological constant etc.\nPossibly, the torsion gravity may solve some problems in cosmology, and\ntherefore, the generalization of metric gravity by including torsion is justified.\nIn this paper, we pay attention to torsion fields which appear in higher\nderivative quantum gravity. As the gravitation interaction (connected with\nthe metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd ) between elementary particles is extremely weak, one\ncan consider the flat Minkowski space-time with torsion.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we outline the geometry\nof space-time with torsion and write down the action of higher derivative\nquantum gravity with torsion. The free torsion field in flat space-time is\nconsidered in Sec. 3. We formulate the first order wave equation for the\ntorsion neutral field in the 11-dimensional matrix form. It is shown that the\ntorsion field which appears in higher derivative quantum gravity possesses\ntwo spins, one and zero, with different masses. When the mass of the spinzero state approaches to infinity, one comes to the Proca equation. Projection\noperators extracting pure spin and mass states are given. We obtain the\nLagrangian in the framework of the first order formalism and the energymomentum tensor. The possible effective interaction of the torsion field with\nexternal electromagnetic fields is discussed in Sec.4. The Hamiltonian form\nof an equation is given. We make a conclusion in Sec.5.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nHigher derivative quantum gravity\nConnection and torsion\n\nSpace-time represents the four-dimensional manifold X4 with points x\u03bc , \u03bc =\n0, 1, 2, 3, and x0 is the time. The parallel transfer of a contravariant vector\nV \u03bc is given by [5]\ndV \u03bc = \u2212\u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 V \u03b1 dx\u03b2 ,\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 is the affine connection with 64 components. The affine connection\ncan be written as a sum of the symmetric part \u0393\u03bc(\u03b1\u03b2) and the antisymmetric\npart \u0393\u03bc[\u03b1\u03b2] :\n\u0011\n1\u0010 \u03bc\n\u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 = \u0393\u03bc(\u03b1\u03b2) + \u0393\u03bc[\u03b1\u03b2] , \u0393\u03bc[\u03b1\u03b2] =\n\u0393\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1 ,\n(3)\n2\nso that the antisymmetric part transforms as a tensor but the symmetric\n..\u03bc\npart not. The antisymmetric part of the connection S\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2261 \u0393\u03bc[\u03b1\u03b2] is called the\nCartan torsion tensor and it possesses 24 components. In GR only the \u0393\u03bc(\u03b1\u03b2)\nis explored with the additional requirements \u0393\u03bc[\u03b1\u03b2] = 0, \u2207\u03b1 g\u03bc\u03bd = 0, and the\ncovariant derivative \u2207\u03b1 is defined as\n\u2207\u03b1 V \u03b2 = \u2202\u03b1 V \u03b2 + \u0393\u03b2\u03b1\u03bc V \u03bc .\n\n(4)\n\n1\n= g \u03bc\u03bb (\u2202\u03b1 g\u03bb\u03b2 + \u2202\u03b2 g\u03bb\u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03bb g\u03b1\u03b2 ) .\n2\n\n(5)\n\nThe symmetric part of the connection, in GR, is named the Christoffel symbol\nand is expressed via the metric tensor:\n(\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n)\n\nThe square of the infinitesimal interval is given by ds2 = \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd . In the\nMinkowskian flat space-time g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd =diag(\u22121, +1, +1, +1).\nNow, we imply that the affine connection \u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 is not symmetric (connection with torsion), but the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd is still constrained by the\nequation f\n\u2207\u03b1 g\u03bc\u03bd = 0 (nonmetricity =0), where f\n\u2207 being the covariant deriva..\u03bc\ntive with torsion. The contorsion tensor K\u03b1\u03b2\nis introduced by the relation\n[5]:\n(\n)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n..\u03bc\n..\u03bc\n..\u03bc\n.\u03bc,\n\u03bc\n.\u03bc\n\u0393\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\u2212 K\u03b1\u03b2\n, K\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u2212S\u03b1\u03b2\n+ S\u03b2.\u03b1\n\u2212 S.\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u2212K\u03b1.\u03b2\n.\n(6)\n\u03b1\u03b2\nAs usual, indices are raised and lowered with the help of the metric tensor. It\n..\u03bc\nshould be mentioned that the contorsion tensor K\u03b1\u03b2\npossesses 24 components\nand depends on metric and torsion tensors [5]. The reader can find the\nclassification of the torsion tensor in [6], [7].\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nAction of renormalized quantum gravity with torsion\n\nThe action of renormalized quantum gravity with torsion is given by (see [8]\nand references therein)\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a \u00121 2\n\u03c9\n1\n2\nd x \u2212g\nC\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 R2 \u2212 2 R + \u039b + \u03b11 S\u03bc\u03bd\n2\u03bb\n3\u03bb\n\u03ba\n4\n\n+ \u03b12 (\u2207\u03bc S \u03bc )2 + \u03b13 (S\u03bc S \u03bc )2 + \u03b14 R\u03bc\u03bd S\u03bc S\u03bd ,\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\n1\n\u03beS\u03bc S \u03bc ,\n\u03ba2\nwhere C\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the Weyl tensor that is expressed through the curvature tensor, R\u03bc\u03bd is the Ricci tensor, \u039b is the cosmological constant, S\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc S\u03bd \u2212\u2202\u03bd S\u03bc ,\n..\u03bc\nand the axial vector S\u03bc is the antisymmetric part of the torsion tensor S\u03b1\u03b2\n:\nS \u03bc = (1/3!)\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 S\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 . Constants \u03ba, \u03c9, \u03bb, \u03be, \u03b1i characterize the gravitational\ninteraction.\nWe note that in Eq.(7) all terms appear as counterterms within the renormalization procedure. Therefore, one can not ignore some terms in Eq.(7) to\nhave the renormalized quantum theory. But there are still two difficulties in\nthe quantum theory based on the action (7). One problem is connected with\nthe cosmological constant. To quantize the metric, we need to expand the\nflat background, but the flat metric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is not the solution of equations of motion. If one puts \u039b = 0 in the bar action, a divergent counterterm appears\nfrom the loop calculations. The second problem is the unitarity problem.\nThis is the main difficulty in the higher derivatives quantum theory. In\nsuch theories the ghosts appear with the negative norm that are considered\nas non-physical states. Nonunitarity of R2 -gravity shows that the gravity\ntheory with the action (7) may be considered as an approximation (or the\neffective model) of the fundamental theory. The interaction of torsion with\nmatter fields is discussed in [8], [9]. It should be mentioned that the axial\nvector S\u03bc interacts with all fermions, but other components of torsion fields\nS\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 can interact with matter only if one introduces non-minimal couplings\n[9]. This interaction can not appear at the quantum level if we consider only\nthe minimal interaction with torsion fields.\nThe generalization of the Einstein -Hilbert action (1) on the case of gravity\nwith torsion leads to the Einstein-Cartan theory. In this case the torsion fields\ndo not propagate because there are no kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. The\n+\u03b15 RS\u03bc S \u03bc \u2212\n\n4\n\n\feffect of torsion fields is in contact spin-spin interactions. At low energies this\neffect is negligible and can be important for physics in the Early Universe.\nFor example, the problem of singularity can be solved in the Einstein-Cartan\ntheory. The main shortcoming of the Einstein-Cartan theory is its nonrenormalizability.\nIn the renormalized quantum gravity kinetic terms of torsion fields appear\ndue to loop calculations, and therefore they have to present in the bare\nLagrangian. To investigate the mass spectrum and properties of propagating\ntorsion fields, we consider here, for simplicity, the flat space-time (g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd )\nwith torsion. So, we neglect the effect of the metric. For this purpose only\nquadratic terms in the torsion field S\u03bc in Eq.(7) are important. From Eq.(7),\nwe arrive at the action for the free torsion field\nST =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\ndx\n\n2\n\u03b11 S\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n+ \u03b12 (\u2202\u03bc S ) \u2212 2 \u03beS\u03bc S \u03bc .\n\u03ba\n\u03bc 2\n\n(8)\n\nWe have ignored the self-interaction term \u03b13 (S\u03bc S \u03bc )2 which is in fourth order\nin fields. The particular case \u03b12 = 0 was considered in [9], [10], and the\ncase \u03b11 = 0 was discussed in [11]. It should be mentioned that all terms in\n(8) have to be presented in order to preserve renormalizability of quantum\ngravity with torsion. The requirement \u03b12 = 0 to have unitarity in the torsion\nsector is a constraint because even without a torsion the quantum gravity\nis non-unitary theory. Therefore, we investigate here the general case of\nnon-zero coefficients in Eq.(8).\n\n3\n\nPropagating torsion fields\n\n3.1\n\nFirst order formulation\n\nBy renormalization of the field S\u03bc , we can make the standard kinetic term\n2\nin action (8): (\u22121/4)S\u03bc\u03bd\n. This means that without loss of generality, one\nmay put \u03b11 = \u22121/4. The corresponding Lagrangian was already considered\nin [12] for complex fields describing charged particles. The torsion fields S\u03bc\nare real, and correspond to neutral fields, but it does not matter for the\nanalysis of the mass spectrum. It was shown that fields described by the\naction (8) possess the state with spin-1 and the square mass m2 = 2\u03be/\u03ba2\nand the state with spin-0 and the square mass m20 = \u2212m2 /2\u03b12 .

This matrix\nallows us to obtain the relativistically invariant bilinear form \u03a8\u03a8 = \u03a8+ \u03b7\u03a8.\n\n8\n\n\fApplying the Hermitian conjugation to Eq.(11), and using equalities [P1 , \u03b7] =\n[P0 , \u03b7] = 0, one obtains the equation as follows:\n!\n\nm2\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u03a8(x) \u03b1\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u2212 mP1 \u2212 0 P0 = 0.\nm\n\n(27)\n\nNow the Lagrangian, in the framework of the first order formalism, reads\n!\n\nm2\nL = \u2212\u03a8(x) \u03b1\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + mP1 + 0 P0 \u03a8(x).\nm\n\n(28)\n\nIt should be noted that the functions \u03a8(x) and \u03a8(x) are dependent because\nthe fields (S, S0 ) are real. Therefore, one has to make the variation of the\naction corresponding to the Lagrangian (28) on \u03a8(x) or \u03a8(x). With the aid\nof the general expression for the canonical energy-momentum tensor\nc\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202\u03bd \u03a8(x) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd L,\n\u2202(\u2202\u03bc \u03a8(x))\n\n(29)\n\none obtains\nc\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2212\u03a8(x)\u03b1\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03a8(x).\n\n(30)\n\nWe took into consideration that L = 0 for fields obeying equations of motion\n(11). With the help of equations (11), (27), it easy to verify that the canonical\nc\nenergy-momentum tensor is conserved: \u2202\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd\n= 0. Using Eq.(12), (26), one\nfinds \u03a8(x) = (\u2212(1/m)S(x), S\u03bc (x), \u2212(1/m)S\u03bc\u03bd (x)), and taking into account\nEq.(13), we obtain\nc\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\n1\n(S\u2202\u03bd S\u03bc \u2212 S\u03bc \u2202\u03bd S + S\u03c1 \u2202\u03bd S\u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 S\u03bc\u03c1 \u2202\u03bd S\u03c1 ) .\nm\n\n(31)\n\nThe canonical energy-momentum tensor is not symmetric but can be symmetrized by the standard procedure. For example, the symmetric energymomentum tensor may be obtained by varying the action on the metric\ntensor. See also [14] for the comparison. We note that the identity j\u03bc =\ni\u03a8(x)\u03b1\u03bc \u03a8(x) = 0 is valid because the torsion fields (S, S0 ) describe neutral\nfields and the electric current is equal to zero, j\u03bc = 0.\n\n9\n\n\f4\n\nElectromagnetic interactions of torsion fields\n\n4.1\n\nNon-minimal interactions\n\nTorsion fields can interact with electromagnetic fields only non-minimally\nbecause they do not carry the electric charge. In [8] the interaction of the kind\na(\u2202\u03bc S\u03bd )Fe \u03bc\u03bd in the Lagrangian was suggested, where Fe \u03bc\u03bd is the dual tensor of\nelectromagnetic fields. However, this interaction results in the appearance of\nthe additional term a\u2202\u03bc Fe\u03bc\u03bd in Eq.(10) which is non-zero only in the presence\nof magnetic monopoles.\nHere, we consider non-trivial electromagnetic interaction of torsion fields\nwhich can be obtained by putting e = 0 in Eq.(55) of [12].

The constants \u03c30 , \u03c31 , \u03c32 are\nconnected with the internal characteristics of torsion particles [12]. It means\nthat if the interaction considered exists, torsion particles may be treated as\ncomposite particles. Possible torsion interaction with electromagnetic fields\nwas discussed in [15].\n\n10\n\n\f4.2\n\nHamiltonian form\n\nLet us consider the Hamiltonian form of Eq.(32) for torsion particles in the\nexternal electromagnetic field. Introducing dynamical and auxiliary components of the wave function \u03b142 \u03a8(x) = \u03c6(x), (1 \u2212 \u03b142 )\u03a8(x) = \u03c7(x) [12], we\narrive, after exclusion \u03c7(x), at the Hamiltonian form:\ni\u2202t \u03c6(x) = \u03b14\n\u0014\n\n\u001a\n\nm20 \u2212 m2\nP0\nm\n\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b3) (m + \u03b1a \u2202a ) +\n+\n\n\u03c32\n\u03c31\nP \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + P \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n2\n\n\u0015\u0012\n\n\u03c30\nP0 \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\n\u03a0\u03b1a \u2202a\nm\n\n(35)\n\n\u0013\u001b\n\n\u03c6(x),\n\nwhere \u03a0 = 1 \u2212 \u03b142 , \u03b3 = (\u03c32 /2m)\u03a0P \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd . We use here the smallness of \u03c32 ,\n\u03c30 (see [12]).\nThe wave function \u03c6(x) possesses eight non-zero components corresponding to states with spin-1 and spin-0 with two values of the energy. It should be\nmentioned that states with spin-1 and spin-0 can not be treated as separate\nparticles, but they are states of one field with multi-spin 1,0 [16].\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe theory of torsion fields having two spin states, one and zero, may be\ntreated as the effective theory. The formulation of wave equations in the first\norder formalism allows us to separate states with spin-1 and spin-0 in the\ncovariant manner with help of projection operators. In the framework of the\nfirst order formalism the Lagrangian and the energy-momentum tensor are\nfound by the standard procedure. The possible effective interaction of torsion\nfields with external electromagnetic fields is discussed and the Hamiltonian\nform of an equation is given.\nThe main difficulty, however, is that the spin-0 state breaks unitarity.\nThis is because the spin-0 state gives negative contribution to the Hamiltonian [13]. But even without torsion, the higher derivative quantum gravity\nsuffers this shortcoming. We can consider the spin-0 state as a ghost and to\nremove it, one has to make the limit m0 \u2192 \u221e.\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] K. S. Stelle, Phys. Rev. D16, 953 (1977).\n[2] S. I.
