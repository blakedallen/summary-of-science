INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently systems have been fabricated which can sustain quantum coherence because of the smallness of their\nsize, provided that the temperature is low enough. These mesoscopic systems are nanostructured devices in which\nquantum coherence sets in at very low temperatures and modifies the properties of the device as a whole. This happens\nnotwithstanding the fact that the system is connected to an external biasing circuit. They have global, geometry\ndependent properties and striking quantization phenomena arise which are largely independent of the specific sample\ninvolved: charge quantization (in unit of the electron charge e), periodicity in the magnetic flux quantum \u03c6o = hc/e,\nconductance quantization (in units of GK = 2e2 /\u03c0h\u0304 = (6.5K\u03a9)\u22121 ).\nAmong these macroscopic quantum phenomena there is the unitary limit of the Kondo conductance in tunneling\nacross a quantum dot (QD) at Coulomb Blockade (CB) [1] [2] that was first measured in 1998 [3]. The Kondo\nphenomenon is well known since the sixties and explains an anomaly in the temperature dependence of the resistivity\nof diluted magnetic alloys [4] [5].\nThis review is devoted to some features of equilibrium Kondo conductance across a quantum dot in the CB regime\ninteracting with two contacts. It is remarkable here that the dot acts as a single impurity probed by the metal\ncontacts, so that the properties of the Kondo state are not mediated over many impurities per cubic centimeter as\nit happens in diluted magnetic alloys. A strongly coupled state sets in between the dot and the contacts and phase\ncoherence is established among the conduction electrons and the whole structure.\nThe temperature scale for the interactions between a magnetic impurity and the delocalized conduction electrons\nof the host metal is the so called Kondo temperature TK . It is defined as the temperature at which the perturbative analysis breaks down. Therefore, different approaches are required to investigate the thermodynamics and the\ntransport properties of a quantum dot in the Kondo regime in the whole range of temperatures from the perturbative\nregion down to the unitarity limit.\nRecently, the Kondo model and the Anderson impurity model in its Kondo limit have been deeply investigated\nby numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations [6], the Bethe ansatz method [7] and conformal field theory\n(CFT) techniques [8]. Further developments in the NRG methods have been applied successfully in the crossover\nregion T \u2248 TK [9]. The zero field spectral and transport properties of the Anderson model in the Kondo regime [10]\nas well as the field and temperature dependence of the Kondo resonance and the equilibrium magnetoconductance\nof the dot [11] have been investigated. The tunneling conductance as a function of the gate voltage has also been\ncalculated with NRG, in wide temperature range for a single quantum dot with Coulomb interactions, assuming that\ntwo orbitals were active for the tunneling process [12].\n1\n\n\fWe leave out the case when the electron distribution is not in local equilibrium about the Kondo impurity and the\nlinear response theory is no longer sufficient. A number of techniques have been applied to describe nonequilibrium\nproperties such as the nonlinear conductance, the nonequilibrium stationary state or the full time development of\nan initially out-of-equilibrium system: variational calculations [13], perturbation theory [14], equation of motion [15],\nperturbative functional integral methods [16], non-crossing approximation (NCA) [17] [18], perturbative renormalization group (RG) method in real time [19]. In particular, the last technique is well suited to describe quantum\nfluctuations which are induced by strong coupling between a small quantum system and an environment. It succeeds\nin reproducing the anomalous line shapes of the conductance observed in several recent experiments [3], due to the\nrenormalization of the resistance and the local energy excitations [20].\nWe also leave out situations in which the levels localized at the dot are close in energy to the Fermi energy of the\ncontacts (mixed valence models).\nThe plan of the paper is the following. We start from the tunneling hamiltonian formalism when the coupling\nbetween the dot and the contacts is weak (Section II). A scattering approach in one-dimension is particularly\nsuitable when studying the linear conductance in the device. The prototype model to account for strong electronelectron repulsion on the dot is the Anderson Hamiltonian with onsite repulsion (Section III). In the limit of strong\ncorrelation between the dot and the leads the latter model maps onto the so called \"Kondo Hamiltonian model\"\n(Section IV ). A poor man's scaling approach up to second order leads us to the definition of the Kondo temperature\nTK . Next, we introduce the physics of the single channel (Section V I) and the two channel Kondo problem (Section\nV II), both in the perturbative region and in the unitarity limit. In such a context we briefly sketch the Anderson,\nYuval and Hamann Coulomb Gas approach [21] to the isotropic and anisotropic one channel Kondo system which\ngives a straightforward, though qualitative, insight of the strongly correlated state.\nIn the conventional setting the dynamical variable which is coupled to the electrons propagating from the leads is\nthe total dot spin. There are cases in which the spin is locked to orbital degrees of freedom or even absent (\"orbital\nKondo\") [22]; such cases are better found in a vertical geometry in presence of a magnetic field orthogonal to the dot\n[23]. A rather strong vertical magnetic field can induce level crossings in the dot due to orbital effects and produce\naccidental degeneracies which can give rise to exotic Kondo couplings (see Section V I.B \u2212 C). Some attention is\ndrawn to the cylindrical geometry and to symmetry selection rules in the cotunneling process, also in connection\nwith proposals for achieving the two channel Kondo non Fermi liquid fixed point in a vertical dot device [24] [25] [26]\n(Section V II.C).\nII. TUNNELING HAMILTONIAN AT WEAK COUPLING\n\nQuantum dots (QD) are fabricated in semiconductor heterostructures, by applying metallic gates to confine few\nelectrons [27]. Because the confining area is quite small (the radius is \u223c 100 \u00f7 1000\u00c5), the charging energy is much\nlarger than the energy associated with thermal fluctuations, provided temperature is below 1\u25e6 K. Therefore the dot\nis only weakly linked to metal contacts and one can bias the system in such a way that the electron number N in\nthe dot can be changed at will. Because of the confining potential, dots display a level structure organized in shells,\nexactly the same as atoms do. Analyzing this level structure is of primary interest because these few interacting\nelectrons (N \u2264 20) confined in a disk-like box (see Fig. 1), at special values of the parameters, are ruled by strong\nmany-body Coulomb correlations. Hund's rules can be seen at work: the total spin S of the electrons confined in\nthe dot is maximized as long as no magnetic field is applied. On the other hand, a magnetic field in the direction\northogonal to the disk produces strong orbital effects which favour larger values of the total angular momentum M\nas well as total spin S.\nQuantum dots are remarkable because of Coulomb oscillations. At very low temperature linear conductance (at\nvanishing bias Vsd ) is zero, except for peaks at discrete values of the gate voltage Vg , when it is energetically favourable\nto add one extra electron to the dot. Therefore Vg controls the number of particles on the dot in the CB regime.\nWe tune the chemical potential \u03bc of the left (L) and right (R) bulk contacts within the CB valley of the conductance\nat N particles, that is \u03bcN < \u03bc < \u03bcN +1,\u03b1 \u2261N +1 E\u03b1 \u2212N E0 ; here the energies N \u00b11E\u03b1 are the total energies for the\ndot with N \u00b1 1 particles characterized by the quantum numbers \u03b1 and NE0 is the ground state energy (GS) at N\nparticles. If N is odd, then the GS is at least doubly degenerate because the odd particle state can have spin \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193.\nIn this case the dot can be treated as a single Anderson impurity.\nThe peculiarity of these artificial atoms is in that the level structure can be investigated by measuring the tunneling\ncurrent. Peaks in the linear conductance versus gate voltage Vg separate regions at Coulomb blockade (CB) in which\nN is fixed and differs by just one electron. The peaks at zero source-drain voltage occur whenever Vg compensates\nthe required chemical potential for electron addition or subtraction. Hence, measuring a tunnel current across the\n2\n\n\fdevice vs Vg provides the spectroscopy of the dot levels. Adding a magnetic field the spin state of the dot can be\nchanged, which in turn changes selection rules for electron tunneling [28].\nThe height and the width of the conductance peaks at resonance depends on temperature T . Let the dimensionless\n2\nconductance be g (in units of 2 eh (factor of 2 is for the spin)). In the simplest case the maximum of the conductance\nat the resonant peak is gmax \u221d \u0393/(kB T ) and the halfwidth of the peak \u0393 = \u03c0\u03bd (0) |V |2 is \u221d T ; here V is the\ntunneling strength (see below) and \u03bd(0) is the density of states at the Fermi energy. In the CB region tunneling via\nvirtual states of the dot with N \u00b1 1 is only fourth order perturbation in V (they are named cotunneling processes),\n\u0010\n\u00112\n|2\ng \u221d e2 \u03c0 2\u03bd(0)|V\n/h\u0304, and vanishes exponentially with reducing temperature.\n\u01ebd\nNevertheless, unexpectedly, transport measurement in a dot gives rise to some new physics which can be related to\nthe Kondo effect of spin impurities in non magnetic metal alloys (see Fig. 2) [3].\nIn the following we introduce the model for a quantum dot interacting with the contacts and define an equivalent\none-dimensional Hamiltonian.\nA. Current within the tunneling Hamiltonian\n\nIn this Subsection we discuss the mutual influence between the contacts and the dot, starting from the weak link\nlimit. Conduction electrons in the leads constitute a Fermi sea (FS) of non interacting fermions with plane wave single\nparticle wavefunctions on side L and on side R. The dot is described by an Hamiltonian HD and coupling between\nthe dot and the leads is accounted for through a tunneling term, so that the Hamiltonian describing the whole system\nis:\nX\nX\nX\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2217 \u2020\nH = HD +\n\u01ebR\n\u01ebL\n[Vk\u03b1 c\u2020k\u03b1\u03c3 d\u03c3 + Vk\u03b1\nd\u03c3 ck\u03b1\u03c3 ].\n(1)\nk\u03c3 ak\u03c3 ak\u03c3 +\nk\u03c3 bk\u03c3 bk\u03c3 +\nk\u03c3\n\nk\u03c3\n\nk\u03b1\u03c3\n\nThe right and left Fermi sea (FS) of the two contacts R, L are acted on by operators ckR\u03c3 \u2261 ak\u03c3 and ckL\u03c3 \u2261 bk\u03c3 (\nhere the index \u03b1 stands for R, L). The canonical transformation of the dot problem made by Glazman and Raikh [1]\nis just the construction of two species of fermions whose wavefunction is even or odd with respect to the dot center,\nin the case that the two barriers are unequal V\u03b1 = VR , VL . It changes the picture from operators ak\u03c3 and bk\u03c3 to\noperators \u03b1k\u03c3 and \u03b2k\u03c3 given by\n\u03b1k\u03c3 = uak\u03c3 + vbk\u03c3 , \u03b2k\u03c3 = ubk\u03c3 \u2212 vak\u03c3\np\nVL\nVR\n, v=\n, V = |VR |2 + |VL |2 ,\nu=\nV\nV\n\n2\n\n\u0393R,L = \u03c0 |VR,L | \u03bd(0)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bd(0) is the density of states at the Fermi energy.\nA general formula for the the conductance of interacting systems [30] [15] [31] has been written, resorting to the\nnonequilibrium Keldysh formalism [32]; in such a framework the current through the interacting region is written in\nterms of the distribution functions in the leads and local properties of the intermediate region, such as the occupation\nand the density of states at the dot site:\nZ\n\u0001\n\b\nie\n(3)\nJ=\nd\u03c9 T r {2 [fL (\u03c9)\u0393L \u2212 fR (\u03c9)\u0393R ] (Gr \u2212 Ga )} + T r 2 (\u0393L \u2212 \u0393R ) G< ,\n2h\n\nwhere Gr , Ga , G< are the usual retarded, advanced, Keldysh Green functions for the dot in interaction with the\nleads and the f are the Fermi functions. The Green's function Gr will be denoted as Gdd in the following. Both Gr\nand \u0393R,L are matrices in case that many channels are present.\nFormula (3) can be cast in a more simple form in the case that the couplings to the leads differ only by a constant\nfactor [15]:\nZ\nn\no\ne\nJ = \u22122\nd\u03c9 [fL (\u03c9) \u2212 fR (\u03c9)] ImT r \u0393\u0303Gr (\u03c9) ,\n(4)\nh\n\nwhere \u0393\u0303 = \u0393R \u0393L /\u0393. Here \u0393 = \u0393R + \u0393L .\nNow we derive explicitely Gdd within the lowest order perturbation in the tunneling.\nWe start from the Hamiltonian in eq. (1), where HD is given by a single impurity energy level \u01ebd . All quantities\nwill be P\nscalar quantities for simplicity. We define the electron retarded Green's function for the unperturbed leads:\n+\nG\u22121\n=\n0\nk (\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebk + i0 ).

In such a case it is\nenough to discuss a single effective contact and the corresponding wavefunctions are plane waves of wavevector k\nin the x-direction with a label \u03b1 which includes all other quantum numbers. Their energy dispersion \u01ebk\u03b1 can be\nlinearized about \u03bc with \u01ebq \u2248 h\u0304vF q, where q is the momentum measured with respect to the Fermi momentum and\nvF is the Fermi velocity. Using a constant density of states \u03bd(0) (at the Fermi energy per spin Lo /2\u03c0h\u0304vF where Lo\nis the size of the system) and a bandwidth of size 2D and neglecting the k dependence of Vk , the sum in eq.

The coupling of the dot to the contacts shifts the location of the pole\ncorresponding to the energy of the localized level and gives a finite width \u0393 to the resonance.\nB. 1-d Scattering formalism\n\nAt zero temperature scattering is only elastic. In the following we develop a 1 \u2212 d scattering approach which\nis mostly useful in vertical structures [33], next we show that also the tunneling conduction can be cast into the\nscattering formalism.\nIf the evolution operator U (t, t\u2032 ) is known, the transmission amplitude can be written in a scattering approach as\nR\u2192L\n\u03b8\n=< b\u2020 U (+\u221e, \u2212\u221e)a >= v \u2217 u < \u03b1\u2020 (\u221e) \u03b1(\u2212\u221e) > \u2212u\u2217 v < \u03b2 \u2020 (\u221e) \u03b2(\u2212\u221e) >\u2261 v \u2217 uS 0 + u\u2217 vS 1 , where we have\ndefined the two expectation values as the scattering matrix elements for the two uncoupled even and odd channels.\nHence, the conductance takes the form of the Landauer formula:\n4\n\n\fg = T R\u2192L \u2261 \u03b8R\u2192L\n\n2\n\n1X l\nS\n2\n\n2\n\n= 4 |v \u2217 u|\n\n2\n\n2\n\n=\n\nl\n\n1X l\n4\u0393R \u0393L\nS .\n2\n(\u0393R + \u0393L ) 2\n\n(12)\n\nl\n\nThe potential after the transformation of eq. (2) has become even, hence unitarity is satisfied by each channel\nR \u0393L\nindividually: |S l |2 = 1, l = 0, 1. The unitary limit of the conductance is gu = (\u03934\u0393\n2 . In particular, if the potential\nR +\u0393L )\n1\nis \u03b4(x), odd parity is totally transmitted and such that S = \u22121.\nEq. (12) is valid for a general system with an interacting intermediate region. One can match this approach to a\n1-d scattering approach for non interacting electrons as it is done here below.\nLet us place the impurity (QD) at x = 0 and consider the scattering amplitude fL,R of a one electron wavefunction\n\u03c8(x)\n\u03c8> (x) \u221d eikx + fR eikx\n\n\u03c8< (x) \u221d e\n\nikx\n\n+ fL e\n\nx >> 0\n\n\u2212ikx\n\nx << 0.\n\n(13)\n\nHere the transmission coefficient is T = |1 + fR |2 while the reflection coefficient is R = |fL |2 and they satisfy the\nconservation of flux: T + R = 1.\nIf the dot structure is even with respect to the origin along the vertical axis, the even parity l = 0 and the odd parity\nl = 1 channels are independent. It is then useful to define even and odd parities f l : f 0 = 12 (fL + fR ), f 1 = 21 (fR \u2212 fL )\nand the elastic t\u2212 matrix tl = iko f l /\u03c0. Here the energy of the incoming particle is h\u0304vF ko (in units h\u0304vF = 1, it follows\nthat [t] = energy) and ko = 2\u03c0/Lo (where Lo is the linear size of the system). The t\u2212 matrix is related to the S\u2212\nmatrix according to:\nl\n\nS l = e2i\u03b4 ;\ntl = \u2212\n\nSl \u2212 1 = \u2212\n\n2\u03c0i l\nt\nko\n\nl\nko\nsin \u03b4 l ei\u03b4\n\u03c0\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b4 l are the phase shifts for the two parities. In this context unitarity of the S\u2212matrix,\nsame as flux conservation R + T = 1.\nConductance is given by the Landauer formula:\n2\n\nconductance = g = T = |1 + fR | = 1 + i\n\nX\n\n1\n2\n\nP\n\nl\n\n|S l |2 = 1, is the\n\n2\nl i\u03b4 l\n\nsin \u03b4 e\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nl\n\nIn the case of resonant tunneling we have T \u223c 1 and R = |fL |2 \u223c 0, so that eq. (15) becomes g \u2192 1, that is the\nunitary limit.\nThe condition R = |\u03c0(t0 \u2212 t1 )/(iko )|2 = sin2 (\u03b4 0 \u2212 \u03b4 1 ) \u223c 0 yields \u03b4 0 \u223c \u03b4 1 \u2261 \u03b4mod \u03c0, while in eq. (15) we have T \u223c 1\nfor \u03b4 0 = \u03b4 1 \u2261 \u03b4 \u2192 \u03c0/2.\nIf the potential is even (\u0393R = \u0393L ), unitarity is satisfied by each channel individually: |S l |2 = 1, l = 0, 1; in\nparticular, if the potential is \u03b4(x), odd parity is totally transmitted and such that S 1 = \u22121, and the conductance\nbecomes:\ng=\n\n1 0\n(S \u2212 1)\n2\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\u03c0 0\nt\nko\n\n2\n\n= sin2 \u03b4 0 .\n\n(16)\n\nAgain, if \u03b4 0 = \u03c0/2 conductance reaches the unitarity limit.\nIn the following we describe the basic approximations and the weak coupling limit of very opaque barriers between\ndot and contacts.\nIn this case tunneling of lead electrons across the dot is a perturbative process as derived in Section IIA. Within\nsuch a perturbative regime neither the dot nor the contacts are much affected by the interaction with the other. The\nrelevant effect on the QD is the shifting of its levels and a level broadening, which is a second-order effect in the\ntunneling strength V . This shows itself as a small imaginary part added to the energy levels, i.e. a finite lifetime.\nIt is easy to show that the linear conductance given above can be rephrased in terms of the imaginary part of the\nGreen's function as in eq. (4) at the perturbative level. To this end, let us first state some formalities regarding the\nselfenergy \u03a3 and the t matrix:\n(E \u2212 H0 \u2212 \u03a3)G = 1; G0 (E \u2212 H0 ) = 1 \u2192 G0 G\u22121 + G0 \u03a3 = 1 \u2192 G = G0 + G0 \u03a3G.\n5\n\n\fIn the Born approximation \u03a3 and t coincide because by definition is G = G0 +G0 tG0 . We assume that in tunneling\nthe odd parity channel is fully transmitted (S 1 = \u22121) and the even parity one gives (see eq. (7)):\n1\n\u01eb\u2212e\n\u01eb0 + i\u0393\n\u2212\u0393\nImt0\n|V |2\n= tan \u03b4 0 =\n,\n,\n\u2192 t0 \u223c\n\u01eb\u2212e\n\u01eb0 + i\u0393\nRet0\n\u01eb\u2212e\n\u01eb0\ntan2 \u03b4 0\n\u03932\nsin2 \u03b4 0 =\n.\n=\n(\u01eb \u2212 e\n\u01eb0 )2 + \u03932\n1 + tan2 \u03b4 0\nt0 \u223c V Gd,d V,\n\nGd,d =\n\n(17)\n\nHere V is the tunneling matrix element defined in eq. (2), e\n\u01eb0 is the renormalized quantity defined in eq. (11) and\n\u0393 = \u0393R + \u0393L is the inverse lifetime of the resonance. This implies that eqs. (12,16) become:\ng = gu sin2 \u03b4 0 =\n\nwhere gu =\n\n4\u0393R \u0393L\n(\u0393R +\u0393L )2 .\n\n4\u0393R \u0393L\n,\n(\u01eb \u2212 e\n\u01eb0 )2 + \u03932\n\nOn the other hand, because ImG = \u2212\u0393/[(\u01eb \u2212 e\n\u01eb0 )2 + \u03932 ], eq. (4) becomes:\ng=\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202f (\u03c9)\nd\u03c9 \u2212\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0393\u0303\n\n\u0393\n,\n(\u01eb \u2212 e\n\u01eb0 )2 + \u03932\n\nwhere \u0393\u0303 = \u0393R \u0393L /\u0393. At zero temperature both results of eqs. (18) and (19) coincide.\nAt finite temperature, if the odd channel is fully transmitted eq.(12) can be generalized as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u0001\u0003\n\u2202f (\u03c9) \u0002\n\u2212\u03c0\u03bd(0)Im t0\ng = gu d\u03c9 \u2212\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nwhere t0 is the t matrix above defined and related to the exact retarded Green function through the relation G =\nG0 + G0 tG0 . We have used the optical theorem:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\b 0 0\u2020\n\u03c02\ni\u03c0 0\n(21)\n=\nRe\nT\nr\nt\nt\nt\nko2\nko\nwhich follows from the unitarity condition |S 0 |2 = 1.\n\nIII. ROLE OF THE ONSITE REPULSION U IN TUNNELING\n\nUp to now HD referred just to a single impurity level \u01ebd . Indeed, charging energy U is the main feature of a QD\nand we have to deal with it. Something which is closer to a QD is an impurity level with onsite repulsion U . Inclusion\nof U in the Hamiltonian (1) leads to the single level Anderson model:\nX\nX\nX\nHAND = Hlead + \u01ebd\nn\u03c3 + U\nn\u03c3 n\u03c3 \u2032 +\nV\u03b1 [c\u2020k\u03b1\u03c3 d\u03c3 + d\u2020\u03c3 ck\u03b1\u03c3 ].\n(22)\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\nk\u03b1\u03c3\n\nIf \u01ebd = \u2212U/2 with respect to the chemical potential of the conduction electrons \u03bc (taken as the zero of the single\nparticle energies), the Anderson model which arises is symmetric. In fact, the energies of the empty impurity state,0 E,\nand of the doubly occupied impurity state, 2 E = 2\u01ebd + U , are both zero, while the singly occupied impurity level has\nenergy 1 E = \u2212U/2.\nIn order to understand how the Coulomb repulsion on the dot site affects the Green's function of the dot we\nuse a path integral formalism. We show that, in the limit in which the charge degree of freedom on the dot is\nfrozen (U \u2192 \u221e), the dot Green's function describes the dynamics of the only degree of freedom left, that is the dot\nmagnetization < n\u2191 \u2212 1/2 >\u2261< 1/2 \u2212 n\u2193 > which is forced by a stochastic field X(\u03c4 ) in imaginary time, produced\nby the scattering of the lead electrons, with a gaussian probability distribution. The excitation energy associated to\nit is shifted from \u01ebd to the Fermi level: this is the origin of the resonance at the Fermi level in the Kondo problem.\nAs a first step, we will rephrase the previous result of an impurity with U = 0 in this new approach. After linearizing\nthe bands, the leads action can be written in terms of the field operators \u03c8u\u03b1 (where \u03b1 = L, R and u includes all\nother quantum numbers) as:\n6\n\n\fSlead = \u2212ivF\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\ndx\n\nX X\n\n\u2020\n\u03c8u\u03b1\n(x, \u03c4 )\n\nu \u03b1=L,R\n\nd\n\u03c8u\u03b1 (x, \u03c4 ).\ndx\n\n(23)\n\nWith respect to the tunneling action, if the L and R barriers are equal and the dot is zero dimensional the interaction\nterm only includes the symmetric combinations \u03a6u (\u03c4 ) = \u221a12 (\u03c8uL (x = 0, \u03c4 ) + \u03c8uR (x = 0, \u03c4 )) at the origin:\nST =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\n\u221a X\n[V \u03a6\u2020u (\u03c4 )du (\u03c4 ) + V \u2217 d\u2020u (\u03c4 )\u03a6u (\u03c4 )].\nd\u03c4 2\n\n(24)\n\nu\n\nThe total action is:\nA=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4\n\n(\n\nX\nu\n\nd\u2020u (\u03c4 )\n\n\u0014\n\n)\n\u0015\n\u2202\n+ (\u01ebd \u2212 \u03bc) du (\u03c4 ) + Slead + ST .\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n(25)\n\nOne can first integrate out the degrees of freedom of the \u03c8u\u03b1 (\u03c4, x) fields for x 6= 0 which are free-like, and next the\nfield \u03a6u at x = 0 which is the only one interacting with the dot variable du (\u03c4 ).

At odds with the case U = 0 here the resonance is at the Fermi level, in spite of the fact that\nthe original localized level is at \u01ebd . The partition function in eq. (28) describes an effective spin-1/2 coupled to the\nfluctuating magnetic field X(\u03c4 ); its dynamics is constrained by the requirement that the impurity is singly occupied.\nIt could be shown that the single site occupancy constraint is fulfilled in the average when the partition function of\neq. (28) is used.\n7\n\n\fB. Quenching of the magnetic moment: singlet ground state\n\nThe representation of the partition function given in eq. (28) allows us to recognize the doubly degenerate ground\n\u03c3\nstate (GS) of the impurity spin Sd = 1/2 with Sdz = (\u22121) (n\u03c3 \u2212 1/2), \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193, driven by the field X(\u03c4 ) and produced\nby virtual tunneling of electrons on and off the dot at energy \u03bc.\nAnderson, Yuval and Hamann [21] calculated eq. (28) by integrating out the impurity (d, d\u2020 fields) and showing\nthat the interaction with the delocalized electrons gives rise to a dynamics of the field X(\u03c4 ) which also interacts\nwith itself at different times according to a logarithmic law. The problem was solved by mapping eq. (28) onto the\npartition function of a Coulomb gas (CG) [34] of flips in 1 \u2212 d, as we show in some detail in this subsection.\n2\nLet us define the new field \u03be(\u03c4 ) = X(\u03c4 )/\u0393, where \u0393 = \u03c0\u03bd(0) |V | is related to the tunneling strength. At low\ntemperatures, saddle point solutions of the resulting single particle effective action are sequences of instantons\n\u03be\u00b1 (\u03c4, l) = \u00b1\u03beM tanh((\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4l )/\u03c4M ) (where \u03c4l , l = 1, 2, . . . are the centers and \u03c4M \u223c \u01eb1F is the width, that is some\ncut-off which regularizes the theory\nat short\n\u0001\n\u0002 times) corresponding \u0003to jumps between the two minima of the effective potential Vef f [\u03be] = \u03932 /U \u03be 2 \u2212 2\u0393/\u03c0 \u03betan\u22121 (\u03be) \u2212 21 ln(1 + \u03be 2 ) , located at \u03beM = \u00b1U/2\u0393, and interacting via a\nlogarithmic potential \u03b12 ln |(\u03c4i \u2212 \u03c4j )/\u03c4M |.\nFor such a CG we can define the bare strength \u03b12b of the logarithmic interaction (the \"charge\") as \u03b12b = 2(1\u22128\u0393/U \u03c0)\nand the \"fugacity\" Y as Y \u2261 \u03c4M e\u2212Stot .\nThus, the full partition function may be approximated with the sum over the trajectories given by hopping paths\nand will be written as:\nZ \u03c42 \u2212\u03c4M\nZ \u03b2\nP\n\u221e\n\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4\nX\nd\u03c41 12 2N\nd\u03c42N\n1\n(\u22121)i+j \u03b12 ln i\u03c4 j\ni6=j=1\nM\nY 2N ],\n(29)\n...\n[e\nZ=\n(2N )! 0 \u03c4M\n\u03c4\nM\n0\nN =0\n\nthat is the partition function of an effective one-dimensional gas of spin flips. The integral over the \"centers of the\ninstantons\" has to be understood such that \u03c4i and \u03c4j never become closer than \u03c4M .\nNow, we are ready to perform the RG analysis to get the behavior of the model at large time scales (low temperatures) [21]. The bare fugacity of the CG is Yb = \u03c4M exp(\u2212\u0100) where \u0100 \u223c \u03c4M U is the action of one single flip. The\nscaling of the fugacity and the renormalization of the coupling constant induced by processes of fusion of charges lead\nto the following Renormalization Group (RG) equations [34]:\n\u03b12\nd\u03b12\ndY\n= (1 \u2212\n= \u22122Y 2 \u03b12\n)Y ;\nd ln \u03c4M\n2\nd ln \u03c4M\n\n(30)\n\n(see Appendix A for a sketch on the derivation).\nWe see clearly that the flow is towards Y \u2192 \u221e and \u03b12 \u2192 0 and the scaling invariant energy (that is the Kondo\n\u03b12\n\n1\n\n\u22121 \u22121/(1\u2212 2 )\ntemperature which we will introduce in the next section) is TK = \u03c4M\ne\n\u223c (U \u0393) 2 e\u2212\u03c0U/(8\u0393) .\nCondensation of instantons in the doubly degenerate GS leads to the Kondo singlet < S z >= 0 on the dot. Now\nwe present an heuristic argument for such quenching of the total spin S on the dot; it runs as follows.\nThe dynamics of the field \u03be(\u03c4 ) with action \u0100 can be mimicked by a two-level system hamiltonian H2l with hopping\n\u0010 \u00112\n2\nd\u03be\n2\nenergy \u03bb \u223c 12 mef f d\u03c4\n(\u03beM /\u03c4M )2 \u223c U/2. The role of the interaction is to project out higher energy\n\u223c 12 \u0393U \u03c4M\n\ncomponents from the dot states. Let us denote by |\u00b1 > the two eigenstates of H2l , i.e. the singlet and the triplet\n(with respect to the total spin of the dot plus conduction electrons, S = 0 and S = 1) on the dot. Instantons, by\nflipping the impurity spin, produce a dynamics of the system \"dot + conduction electrons \" between these two states.\nNow, let us make an interesting analogy with thermodynamics. At temperature \u03b2 \u22121 the probabilities of having the\nsystem in one of the two states will be given by [35]:\nP+ =\n\ne\u22122\u03b2\u03bb\n1\n; P\u2212 =\n\u22122\u03b2\u03bb\n1+e\n1 + e\u22122\u03b2\u03bb\n\npartly eliminating the component on the high energy eigenstate |\u2212 >. Thus we are ready to give the connection with\nthe CG picture described by the partition function of eq. (29). In our case the dynamics is given by the coherent\nzero point fluctuations of the system as a whole. From the statistical weight associated to a configuration with N\ninstantons we can easily write down the formula:\nP\u221e\n2N\n/(2N )!\nd\nN =0 2N Y\nln(coshY ) = Y tanhY.\n(31)\n=Y\nhN i \u2261 hNinst i = P\n\u221e Y 2N /(2N )!\ndY\nN =0\n8\n\n\fThe frequency \u03bb/2\u03c0 is obviously related to the average number of flips: \u03b2\u03bb/2\u03c0 =< N >= Y tanh Y , as a direct\nimplication of eq. (31).\nHence, the probabilities of having the system in the states |\u00b1 > within the ground state (T = 0) are:\nP+ =\n\n1\n1+\n\ne\u22124\u03c0Y tanh Y\n\n; P\u2212 =\n\ne\u22124\u03c0Y tanh Y\n*\n1 + e\u22124\u03c0Y tanh Y\n\n(32)\n\nBecause Y scales to infinity, the higher energy state completely decouples and the total spin on the dot is quenched:\n< S z >\u2192 0.\nIV. PERTURBATIVE ANALYSIS AT T >> TK\n\nThe Kondo Effect in metals containing magnetic impurities is responsible for the \"anomalous\" minimum in the\nresistivity \u03c1(T ), as the temperature T \u223c TK : such a minimum in \u03c1(T ) is due to scattering of conduction electrons off\nthe localized magnetic\nimpurities. Those contributions were first worked out by Kondo [36], who derived a correction\n\u0001\n\u2206\u03c1(T ) \u221d ln TTK .\nAs we pointed out in the introduction, a different realization of the Kondo effect may be achieved, in a controlled\nway, in a quantum dot in Coulomb Blockade (CB)-regime [3]. The Kondo effect in a dot is usually detected by\nmeasuring the linear conductance as a function of the gate voltage by connecting two electrodes to the dot. A dot at\nCB exhibits discrete energy levels. Changing the number of electrons is strongly prevented by electrostatic charging\nenergy. Correspondingly, the total charge at the dot is quantized and the linear conductance is zero within large\nwindows of variations of the gate voltage (\"CB-valleys\"). By analyzing the level structure of the dot it has been\nshown that, in some special cases, the dot at CB behaves as a magnetic moment antiferromagnetically interacting\nwith the magnetic momenta of lead electrons. CB-valleys at different occupation number of the dot are bounded by\nresonant conduction peaks, as the chemical potential of the leads matches the one of the dot. Those peaks usually get\nsharper and better defined as T is lowered. However, as T \u223c TK , Kondo effect arises at the dot. Consequently, the\nCB-valley between two resonant conduction peaks \"fills in\" in a way that does not depend on the position of the Fermi\nlevel of the leads [3]. As T \u223c TK , the conductance g(T ) exhibits the typical logarithmic raise [37]. The logarithmic\nraise, however, cannot hold all the way down to T = 0, as it must be limited by the unitarity bound. Therefore, a\ndifferent approach is required in order to study Kondo effect in the T = 0-unitarity limit, as we will discuss in the\nnext section.\nIn this Section we derive the Kondo Hamiltonian from the single impurity Anderson model (eq. 22) focusing for\nsimplicity on the isotropic case J\u22a5 = Jz = J, then we sketch the perturbative Renormalization Group (RG) flow for\nthe coupling strength of such a model. In general, the lower is T , the more spin-flip processes become likely, which\nmake the running coupling constant J grow. At the Kondo temperature TK the perturbative analysis breaks down,\nthat is \u03bd (0) J(TK ) \u223c 1, so that TK is the characteristic scale that divides the regions of weak and strong coupling.\nA. Derivation of the spin dynamics hamiltonian\n\nIn the following we will restrict our analysis to a two-fold degenerate dot level: in such a case the QD can be\nmodelized as a spin-1/2 magnetic impurity. Indeed, because the charge degree of freedom is frozen at Coulomb\n~d and describe its interaction with the delocalized electrons by means\nBlockade we mimick the dot with its total spin S\nof the Kondo Hamiltonian:\n~d *~\u03c3 (0),\nHeff = Hlead + HK \u2261 Hlead \u2212 J S\n\n(33)\n\nP P\n\u2192\n\u03c4 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ck\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 ) plays the role of a spin density of the itinerant electrons at the impurity site\nwhere ~\u03c3 (0) = kk\u2032 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (c\u2020k\u03c3 \u2212\n1\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2032\n( \u03c4 \u03c3\u03c3 are the Pauli spin\u2212 2 matrices). Its components behave as a spin\u2212 21 , provided single occupancy of the site\nx = 0 is guaranteed.\nIn the anisotropic Kondo model the couplings of the x, y components J\u22a5 are different from the one of the z\ncomponent Jz . This effective Hamiltonian is more suitable to describe the low-T physics of the system because\nits dynamics shows how the system flows towards the nonperturbative regime. In the following sections by \"low\ntemperature\" we'll mean T \u223c TK .\n\n9\n\n\fAs a first step we show that it is possible to derive\nP the effective\nP Hamiltonian (33) from the one for the single\nimpurity Anderson model (eq. 22), where HD = \u01ebd \u03c3 n\u03c3 + U \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 n\u03c3 n\u03c3\u2032 , by means of the Schrieffer-Wolff (SW)\ntransformation [38]. More details can be found on the book by Hewson [5].\nLet \u039e be the space spanned by the (almost) degenerate dot's states. As the number of electrons at the QD is fixed,\nthe relevant degrees of freedom can be described by an effective Hamiltonian Heff acting onto \u039e only. In order to\nconstruct Heff , we apply the SW transformation to the Hamiltonian in eq. (22). We denote by P the projector onto\n\u039e and by \u01ebd the energy of the states within \u039e, so that the effective Kondo Hamiltonian is given by:\n\u03b4Heff \u2248 P V (1 \u2212 P )\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 P ) V P.\n\u01ebd \u2212 HD \u2212 Hlead\n\n(34)\n\nIndeed, by inserting eq. (22) into eq. (34), we get the result:\nHeff = Hlead \u2212 \u03bd (0)\n\u2212\n\nX\n\nXV2\n\n\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 ;\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 ;k,k\u2032\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\u03c3\n\n\u01ebd\n\nV\u03b1 V\u03b1\u2032\n\nd\u2020\u03c3 d\u03c3 +\n\u0014\n\nX\n\nV\u03b12\n\n\u03b1\u03c3;k,k\u2032\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1 \u2020\n1\nc c \u2032 +\n+\n\u01ebd + U\n\u01ebd k\u03b1\u03c3 k \u03b1\u03c3\n\n\u0015\n1 \u2020 ~\n1\nc Sd *~\u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ck\u2032 \u03b1\u2032 \u03c3\u2032\n\u2212\n\u01ebd + U\n\u01ebd k\u03b1\u03c3\n\n(35)\n\nP\nwhere Sdz = \u03c3 \u03c3d\u2020\u03c3 d\u03c3 , Sd+ = d\u2020\u2191 d\u2193 and Sd\u2212 = d\u2020\u2193 d\u2191 are the impurity spin components. Spin commutation relations\nare obtained if no double occupancy is admitted.\nBesides Hlead , the first and the second term at the r.h.s. of eq. (35) represent, respectively, a renormalization\nof the dot's energies and a potential scattering term; the third term is the one which induces spin flips. The two\ncontributions appearing in the potential scattering term and in the spin-flip term refer to two virtual particle and hole\nprocesses, respectively. In the first case a particle is added to the dot so that the energy \u01ebd + U is involved, while in\nthe second case a particle is subtracted from the dot level thus paying the energy |\u01ebd |. The potential scattering term\nvanishes if the Anderson model is symmetric, as we have assumed up to now (\u01ebd = \u2212U/2).\nB. Perturbative Renormalization Group Approach\n\nIn this Subsection the starting point of our reasoning is, for simplicity, the isotropic limit of Kondo hamiltonian in\neq. (33). Scattering of conduction electrons by the impurity produces a self energy correction, as well as a correction\nto the interaction vertex. The transitions between the states close to the Fermi level \u01ebF and the states within a\nnarrow strip of energies of width \u03b4D near the edges of the band of width 2D are associated with an high energy\ndeficit. Such transitions are virtual and their influence on the states near \u01ebF can be taken into account perturbatively\nin the second order. In the poor man's scaling approach one includes second order corrections arising from processes\nin which the electrons k \u2032 are scattered to an intermediate state at energy D > \u01ebk\u2032\u2032 > D \u2212 \u03b4D or \u2212D < \u01ebk\u2032\u2032 < \u2212D + \u03b4D\nwhere D is some ultraviolet cut-off. Because they involve high intermediate energies, one can think of including them\nperturbatively, so for an electron k \u2032 scattered into the final state k we have:\nX\n\nk\u2032\u2032 \u2208\u03b3\n\n< k|HK |k \u2032\u2032 >< k \u2032\u2032 |\n\n1 ~ XX \u2020 \u2212\n1\n|k \u2032\u2032 >< k \u2032\u2032 |HK |k \u2032 >\u223c \u2212J 2 \u03bd(0)\u03b4D S\nck\u03c3 \u2192\n\u03c4 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ck\u2032 \u03c3\u2032\nd*\nE \u2212 Hlead\nD\n\u2032\n\u2032\nkk\n\n(36)\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the k \u2032\u2032 domain mentioned above. To justify the second step one observes that, in the shell \u03b3, the operator\nHlead can be replaced by an energy D and, in comparison to it, the eigenvalue E can be put at the Fermi level E = 0.\nThe result is an effective Hamiltonian acting within the band of a reduced width D \u2212 \u03b4D, of the same form as HK in\neq. (33) but with a modified value of J. This gives the following correction to the previous coupling constant in HK :\n\u03b4J \u223c \u2212J 2 \u03bd(0)\u03b4D/D [39]. Successive reductions of the bandwidth by small steps \u03b4D can be viewed as a continuous\nprocess during which the initial Hamiltonian is trasformed to an effective low-energy Hamiltonian acting within the\nband of reduced width D \u2212 \u03b4D. The evolution of the exchange amplitude J during such a poor man's scaling can be\ncast into the form of a flow differential equation [39]:\ndJ\n= \u2212\u03bd(0)J 2 .\nd ln D\nIntegration of eq. (37) gives rise to the renormalization of J:\n10\n\n(37)\n\n\f1\nD\n1\n,\n\u2212\n= ln\nj(D) j(D0 )\nD0\n\n(38)\n\nwhere j = J\u03bd(0), that is\nj0\n.\n1 \u2212 j0 ln DD0\n\nj(D) =\n\n(39)\n\nScaling can be performed down to D \u223c kB T , also we see that, if j0 \u2261 j(D0 ) > 0 (antiferromagnetic coupling), the\n1\nrunning coupling constant j increases. Eq. (38) shows that De\u2212 j is a constant of this flow, which defines an energy\nscale as TK :\n1\n\nkB TK = D0 e\u2212 j0 .\n\n(40)\n\nIn general, at the Kondo temperature TK the system has approached the scale at which the perturbative analysis\nbreaks down, so that for T < TK j starts to diverge in the flow.\nNow we discuss the conductance in such a perturbative limit. Let us take a \u03b4(x) -like dot with an even barrier\npotential (\u0393R = \u0393L ). To lowest perturbative order the leading self-energy correction to t0 (\u03c9 + i0+ ) (see eqs. (16),\n(17)) (\u03c9 = 0) yields:\n\u03c0 0\nt\nko\n\ng=\nwhere\n\n1\n\u03bd(0)J\n\n\u001a\n\n2\n\n= Re\n\ni\u03c0 0\nt\nko\n\n\u001b\n\n\u2248 \u03c0 2 (\u03bd(0)J)2 ,\n\n(41)\n\n= ln TTK is the invariant charge defined through eq. (40), so that the conductance can be written as:\ng \u2248 \u03c0 2 ln\u22122\n\nT\n,\nTK\n\nTK \u226a T \u226a D.\n\n(42)\n\nThe tail of the conductance in the perturbative limit T \u226b TK is logarithmic.\nC. One channel anisotropic Kondo model and the Toulouse limit\n\nIn the following we rewrite the Coulomb gas approach introduced in subsection V.B focusing on the single channel\nanisotropic Kondo system. Let us start from the general effective Hamiltonian:\nA\nA\nHeff\n= Hlead + HK\n\u2261 Hlead + Jz Sdz \u03c3z (0) +\n\n\u0001\nJ\u22a5 +\nSd \u03c3\u2212 (0) + Sd\u2212 \u03c3+ (0) .\n2\n\n(43)\n\nAs stated in ref. [21], the perturbation term (the one containing J\u22a5 ) has the effect of flipping the local spin at\neach application; hence the problem of calculating the partition function of such a system reduces to the evaluation\nof the amplitude for a succession of spin flips at times \u03c41 , \u03c42 , ... and the Feynman sum over histories is the sum over\nall possible numbers and positions of flips. So, we get the expression (29) which can be rewritten as:\nZCG =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nN =0\n\n(J\u22a5 \u03c4M )\n\n2N\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c42N\n...\n\u03c4M\n\nZ\n\n\u03c42 \u2212\u03c4M\n\n0\n\nd\u03c41 +\n[e\n\u03c4M\n\nP2N\n\ni6=j=1\n\n(\u22121)i+j (2\u2212\u03b5) ln\n\n\u03c4i \u2212\u03c4j\n\u03c4M\n\n].\n\n(44)\n\nHere \u03b5 is the quantity:\n\u03b5=\n\n8\u03b4AF\n8\u03b4 2\n\u2243 2Jz \u03c4M\n\u2212 AF\n\u03c0\n\u03c02\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03b4AF is the scattering phase shift of antiferromagnetic sign introduced by the Jz Sdz \u03c3z (0) term. It can be seen\nclearly that the sign of Jz , or \u03b5, determines whether the coupling is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, so the condition\n\u03b5 > 0 gives the antiferromagnetic coupling.\nLet us now notice that eq. (44) is a function of three parameters only: \u03c4\u03c4M , J\u22a5 \u03c4M , \u03b5; we are interested to the case\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e (low temperature). In such a case it is well known that the ferromagnetic Kondo system has a mean spin\nmoment which corresponds to a long range order of the classical system: the positive and negative charges are all\n11\n\n\fbound in pairs forming dipoles all pointing in the same direction. The phase transition occurs, at least for small J\u22a5 ,\nat the ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic boundary point \u03b5 = 0.\nFor such a system it is possible to derive a set of scaling equations by renormalization of the cut-off \u03c4M ; these laws\nare exact for small J\u22a5 \u03c4M and \u03b5. The physical picture is that of many close pairs of flips which change slightly the mean\nmagnetization, located between pairs of isolated flips which are reversals of the magnetization over a larger timescale;\nso, the isolated flips can be considered as acting in a medium where the close pairs modify the mean magnetization.\nThis line of reasoning leads to the following scaling laws for the \"fugacity\" J\u22a5 \u03c4M and the \"charge\" \u03b5 respectively:\n\u03b5\nd\u03b5\nd (J\u22a5 \u03c4M )\n2\n= (J\u22a5 \u03c4M ) ;\n= (2 \u2212 \u03b5) (J\u22a5 \u03c4M ) .\nd ln \u03c4M\n2\nd ln \u03c4M\n\n(46)\n\nLet us make a few comments on such equations. First, these are also exact for finite \u03b5, because only J\u22a5 \u03c4M need\nto be small. Second, they are compatible in the isotropic case Jz = J\u22a5 , \u03b5 \u2243 2Jz \u03c4M \u2243 2J\u22a5 \u03c4M where J\u22a5 \u03c4M and \u03b5 are\nsmall; because J\u22a5 \u03c4M and \u03b5 scale together, the isotropic Kondo system remains isotropic at every time scale. In the\nanisotropic model, eqs. (46) become:\nd\u03b5\nJ\u22a5 \u03c4M\n2 2\n\u22434\n; \u03b52 \u2212 4J\u22a5\n\u03c4M = const,\nd (J\u22a5 \u03c4M )\n\u03b5\n\n(47)\n\nthus the scaling lines are a set of hyperbolas with asymptotes corresponding to the isotropic case.\nWe see clearly from Fig. 3 that all ferromagnetic cases below the isotropic one scale onto the case J\u22a5 \u03c4M = 0 which\nis an ordered one, so the transition line coincide with the ferromagnetic case. Conversely, in the antiferromagnetic\n(AF) case J\u22a5 \u03c4M and \u03b5 increase starting from some values, small at will, and we always can find a timescale for\nwhich \u03b5 \u223c 1. Such a timescale is a crucial one for the Kondo phenomenon, it is the Kondo temperature already\nintroduced in the previous sections and sets the scale at which the system behaves as it were strongly coupled. Thus,\nthe renormalization procedure is valid up to \u03b5 \u223c 1.\nNow, let us briefly focus on the so-called Toulouse limit Jz = J\u22a5 , \u03b5 \u223c 1; in such a case the system is equivalent to\na simple quadratic model with Hamiltonian:\nX\nX\nHT =\n\u01ebk c\u2020k ck + V\n[d\u2020 ck + c\u2020k d].\n(48)\nk\n\nk\n\nHere ck , c\u2020k are Fermi operators for free spinless electrons and d, d\u2020 are Fermi operators for a local resonant state.\nThe partition function corresponding to the Hamiltonian (48) is exactly equal to the one in eq. (44) for the case of\nclassical charges \u00b11. Such a theory corresponds to free particles and there is no renormalization.\nV. BREAKDOWN OF PERTURBATIVE APPROACH AT T \u223c TK : STRONG-COUPLING FIXED POINT\n\nIn the previous Section we have derived the perturbative flow equation for the Kondo coupling constant J. Integration of the renormalization group (RG) equation shows that J grows as T is lowered, until the perturbative analysis\ndoes not make any sense anymore. The question whether the RG flow stops at some finite-T scale fixed coupling\nor goes all the way down to T = 0 has been widely debated in the literature (see [5] for a review on the subject).\nHowever, from numerical RG analysis and from the exact Bethe-ansatz solution of the model [7] it is now clear that\nthe system takes no fixed points at finite T , but the RG flow goes all the way down to T = 0. So, the aim of this\nSection is to discuss the physics of the Kondo system in the T = 0-unitarity limit.\nIn the case of a localized spin-1/2 impurity antiferromagnetically interacting with the spin of one type of itinerant\nelectrons only (spin-1/2, one channel Kondo effect), the theory of the unitary limit was first developed by Nozi\u00e9res\n[40]. As T is lowered all the way down to 0, the flow of the coupling strength runs all the way toward an \u221e-coupling\nfixed point. At the fixed point, the impurity spin is fully screened and the localized magnetic moment is effectively\nsubstituted by a spinless potential scattering center with infinite strength (which forbids double occupancy at the\nimpurity site). The T \u2192 0 \"unitarity limit\" is well-described by a Fermi liquid theory, which also allows for calculation\nof finite-T corrections to fixed-point values of the physical quantities. Both elastic and inelastic scattering processes\nprovide finite-T contributions to the conductance. As we will show in the next section, the two kinds of processes\n\u0010 \u00112\n[40].\ncontribute at the same order, thus giving raise to corrections to the unitary limit proportional to TTK\n\nA generalization of Kondo's original idea was done by Nozi\u00e9res and Blandin [41]. They showed that interaction of\nitinerant electrons with magnetic impurities in metals may involve electrons with different quantum numbers besides\n12\n\n\fthe spin: for instance, electrons with different orbital angular momentum. Different orbital quantum numbers define\ndifferent \"channels\" of interaction. Therefore, \"many channel\" Kondo effect may arise. Although in the perturbative\nregion there is no qualitative difference between one-channel and many-channel effect, deep differences may arise in\nthe unitarity limit, depending on the number of channels K and on the total spin of the impurity, S.\nIn the case 2S = K, at T = 0 the magnetic moment at the impurity is fully screened by electrons from the leads.\nThe impurity forms a singlet state with 2S conduction electrons and no other electrons can access the impurity\nsite. The system behaves exactly as if there were no impurity, besides a boundary condition on the wavefunction\nof conduction electrons which takes into account that the impurity site is \"forbidden\" to them [40]. Such a Fermi\nliquid state is stable against leading finite-T corrections, as we shall see below, and corresponds to an infinite effective\ncoupling \u03bd (0) J. A special case of this is the one channel Kondo just discussed, with S = 12 and K = 1.\nIn the case 2S > K, in the strong coupling regime a residual magnetic moment is still present at the impurity,\nsince there are no more conduction electrons able to screen the localized spin. The corresponding fixed point is again\na Fermi liquid, but with a localized partially screened magnetic moment at the impurity that is ferromagnetically\ncoupled to the itinerant electrons: it again provides the stability of the local Fermi liquid.\nA very special case is the 2S < K one. In such a case conduction electrons attempt to \"overscreen\" the impurity\nin the strong coupling limit, that is the resulting magnetic moment is opposite to the original one. The coupling\namong the localized residual magnetic moment and the itinerant electrons is now antiferromagnetic. It drives the\nsystem out of the strongly coupled regime towards a finite-coupling fixed point J\u2217 [41], as we clearly see in Fig. 4. At\nJ = J\u2217 the leading finite-T interaction is given by a marginal three-particle operator which breaks down the Fermi\nliquid state and generates a non-Fermi liquid behavior in the physical quantities. We will discuss such an issue in the\nSection V II of this review.\nVI. THE FULLY SCREENED SINGLE CHANNEL KONDO CASE\nA. Finite temperature corrections to the one-channel Kondo conductance\n\nAt T = 0 the linear response of the Kondo system to an applied voltage bias reaches the so called unitarity limit.\nThe response function is the resistivity in a bulk system (magnetic impurities in diluted alloys), while it is the\nconductance in a quasi one-dimensional system as the system of our interest: a dot with applied contacts.\nThe striking feature of the Kondo effect in diluted alloys is the minimum in the resistivity at low temperature which\nviolates the expected property: d\u03c1/dT > 0. Indeed, well below TK the resistivity increases again up to a maximum\nvalue proportional to the number of impurities Ni per unit volume (\"unitarity limit\").\nOn the contrary a maximum of the conductance is expected at T = 0 for Kondo conductance across a quantum\n2\ndot, where the unitarity limit that is reached is 2eh gu .\nBeing the s\u2212wave scattering effectively one-dimensional like, such a 'reversed behavior' looks paradoxical. However,\nit is just a consequence of the difference between the 3-d and 1-d impurity scattering, as we explain here. In order to\nillustrate the difference, it is enough to note that both facts stem from the main feature of Kondo impurity scattering:\nthe formation of a resonance at the Fermi level due to many-body effects, which implies that the phase shift reaches\nthe value \u03b4 = \u03c0/2 and that scattering is resonant at the impurity. This produces different results in the two cases:\n3-d: a spherical s\u2212 wave is diffracted from the impurity with maximum amplitude at the resonance, what increases\nthe flux propagating backward and enhances resistivity.\n1-d : resonant scattering coincides with resonant trasmission in this case, what implies the vanishing of backward\nreflection and enhances the conductance.\nTemperature corrections are twofold. One is due to the energy dependence of the phase shift close to the resonance\n\u03b4 0 (\u01eb) = \u03c0/2 \u2212 a\u01eb2 and to the fact that energies close to the Fermi surface are sampled, because the Fermi functions\nare not step-like at finite T . The second one is due to inelastic processes which produce transitions from the singlet\nground state to the excited states. The latter can be accounted for with an expansion in inverse powers of the singlet\nbinding energy [40]. We include a simplified approach to the problem which rests on the Fermi liquid nature of the\nexcitation spectrum in Appendix B [40] [8] [10]. It is found that corrections to the conductance are quadratic in\ntemperature, as it is usual in the Fermi liquid theory:\n\"\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\n\u03c0T\n,\nT \u226a TK .\n(49)\ng = gu 1 \u2212\nTK\n13\n\n\fThe weak-coupling (T \u226b TK ) and the strong-coupling (T \u226a TK ) asymptotes of the conductance, eqs. (42) and (16),\nhave a very different structure but, since the Kondo effect is a crossover phenomenon rather than a phase transition\n[6] [7], the dependence g (T ) is a smooth function [10] throughout the crossover region T \u223c TK :\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT\n.\n(50)\ng = gu f\nTK\nThe universal function f (x), as found by resorting to numerical renormalization group (NRG) in refs. [10] [11], is\n2\n\u22122\nand f (0) = 1.\nplotted in Fig. 5. It interpolates between f (x \u226b 1) = 3\u03c0\n16 (ln x)\nB. The Kondo resonance in a magnetic field\n\nA small magnetic field B lifts the degeneracy of the spin states at the impurity.This produces a splitting of the\nresonance and a change of its shape which has been numerically studied mostly via NRG [11]. The splitting of the\npeak increases linearly with B and is \u2206 = 2\u03bcB B, i.e. twice the Zeeman spin splitting.\nThis can be understood easily if one considers the particle and hole virtual occupations which mediate the Kondo\ninteraction.\nLet us consider the symmetric case \u01ebd = \u2212U/2. The dot states with N electrons and one unpaired spin are N \u2191\nand N \u2193 corresponding to \u01ebd + B/2 (\u03bcB = 1) and \u01ebd \u2212 B/2, respectively. In presence of spin splitting two particle\nprocesses are allowed: p\u03c3 (p\u2212\u03c3 ) in which a spin \u2212\u03c3 is added to the state N \u03c3 and subsequently a spin \u2212\u03c3 is removed\nwith the energy balance:\np\u2193 \u2192 \u03b4E(N \u2191, + \u2193) + \u03b4E(N + 1, \u2212 \u2191) = U + (\u2212U \u2212 B) = \u2212B\np\u2191 \u2192 \u03b4E(N \u2193, + \u2191) + \u03b4E(N + 1, \u2212 \u2193) = (U + B) + (\u2212U ) = B.\nSimilarly the hole processes have an energy balance:\nh\u2191 \u2192 \u03b4E(N \u2191, \u2212 \u2191) + \u03b4E(N \u2212 1, + \u2193) = (\u2212\u01ebd \u2212 B/2) + (\u01ebd \u2212 B/2) = \u2212B\nh\u2193 \u2192 \u03b4E(N \u2193, \u2212 \u2193) + \u03b4E(N \u2212 1, + \u2191) = (\u2212\u01ebd + B/2) + (\u01ebd + B/2) = B.\nThis implies that there are two peaks in the spectral density at \u03c9 = \u00b1B corresponding to the p\u2193 , h\u2191 and p\u2191 , h\u2193 spin\nflip processes, respectively.\nThe value at the Fermi energy of the spectral function is related to the B-dependent phase shift in the Fermi liquid\npicture by the Friedel sum rule:\n\u2212\u03c0\u03bd (0) Im (t\u03c3 (\u03c9 = 0, T = 0, B)) = sin2 \u03b4\u03c3 (B).\n\n(51)\n\nThe Bethe Ansatz solution of the problem relates the phase shift at the Fermi level to the magnetization of the\nimpurity: \u03b4\u03c3 (B) = \u03c02 [1 \u2212 2Md (B)] [43]. Hence a reduction of the peak height with increasing of the magnetic field\nfollows.\nIt has also been argued that the renormalizability of the Kondo problem could break down when B exceeds some\ncritical value related to the Kondo temperature, because of the back action of the induced conduction electron\npolarization cloud on the impurity leading to a broken symmetry state with < Sz >6= 0 [44].\nC. Crossing of the dot levels in a magnetic field and enhancement of the Kondo conductance\n\nConventional Kondo resonant transmission requires a magnetic moment to be present on the dot. Usually dots\nwith an even number of electrons are in a singlet state, while dots with an odd number of electrons have an unpaired\nspin and have a doublet GS. Hence, there is a parity effect: CB conduction valleys with N = even do not display\nthe Kondo conductance while those with N = odd do. An exception to this rule occurs at zero magnetic field when\nHund's rule applies. This was found experimentally in vertical QD e.g. at N = 6. The GS of the isolated dot has\nS = 1 (triplet) [45]. An underscreened Kondo effect is expected at this point and the GS of the interacting system\nbecomes a doublet. By applying a weak magnetic field orthogonal to the dot (B = 0.22T esla), a transition of the GS\nfrom triplet to singlet (T- S) has been found. The single particle energy levels become angular momentum dependent\nand Hund's rule no longer applies. Close to the crossing a remarkable enhancement of Kondo coupling with increase\nof the Kondo temperature was experimentally found. Indeed, scaling shows a non universal critical temperature when\nthe interplay of the fourfold degenerate states (|SSz > with S = 0, 1) is included [46].\nAn extended and unified approach to the problem can be found in [47]. A minor difference is the fact that they\nconsider an in-plane magnetic field as the source of the crossing which could produce Zeeman spin splitting (ZSS) of\n14\n\n\fthe single particle states. The four dot states are mapped onto a two impurities Kondo model (2IKM) [48] with spin\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\nS 1 , S 2 . However they are coupled by a potential term V n\u03c1nn (0) S 1 * S 2 and an exchange term iInsnn (0)* S 1 \u00d7 S 2 .\nHere \u03c1, \u03c3 are the charge and spin density of the conduction electrons with n and n 6= n labeling two different orbital\nstates. Because these terms violate the invariance under particle-hole transformation, the 2IKM cannot flow by scaling\nto the non Fermi-liquid fixed point, which is known to be a remarkable feature of the model. In the case of large ZSS\n\u2206 the RG flow terminates at D \u2248 \u2206. Two of the four states are ruled out in the flow and conduction electrons couple\nto one single effective spin 1/2 with one extra unusual term in the effective Hamiltonian which is a Zeeman term for\nthe conduction electrons.\nKondo conductance can take place in a dot with an even number of electrons also in a strong vertical magnetic\nfield [35]. Orbital effects induced by B can produce the reversed transition from the singlet to the triplet state (S-T).\nIndeed, a vertical magnetic field on an isolated dot favors transitions to higher spin states [49]. In this case the ZSS\nis anyhow sizeable and the crossing involves the singlet state and the component of the triplet state lowest lying in\nenergy. In a vertical geometry with cylindrical symmetry orbital angular momentum m and z\u2212 spin component \u03c3 are\ngood quantum numbers. In particular because the singlet state has total angular momentum M = 0 and the triplet\nstate involved in the crossing has M = 1, only a (m = 0 \u2193) electron can enter the dot when it is in the triplet state.\nOn the contrary, only an (m = 1 \u2191) electron can enter the dot, if it is in the singlet state. This implies that there is\none single channel of conduction electrons involved in cotunneling processes, with orbital and spin degrees of freedom\nlocked together. Again, a residual effective spin 1/2 survives at the dot, while N is even [23]. This is another striking\nmanifestation of the spin-charge separation that occurs at the Kondo fixed point. Usual Kondo coupling leads to\nN = odd together with S = 0. In the complementary situation here described, it is N = even and S = 1/2.\nVII. THE OVERSCREENED TWO CHANNEL KONDO CASE\n\nA two channel Kondo behavior has been invoked in an experiment by Ralph and Buhrman [50] on clean Cu point\ncontacts, defects in the metal that can be described by two level systems (TLS). The TLS could tunnel between\nthe even and odd state with the assistance of the conduction electrons. Their physical spin is not involved in the\nscattering, so that two channels are available [51]. It is still unclear whether the Kondo temperature can be large\nenough so that any effect of the Kondo correlation can be measured [52]. However, these experiments have triggered\nrenewed interest in two channel Kondo conductance. The temperature and voltage dependence of the conductivity\nhave been numerically calculated within the \"Non Crossing Approximation\" (NCA) [53] and found to be consistent\nwith a scaling Ansatz motivated by the Conformal Field Theory (CFT) solution of the problem [8]. Since then, no\nother experimental proof of two channel Kondo effect in impurities has been produced. The result for the imaginary\npart of the transmission t is:\nr\n\u03c9\n.\n(52)\nImt(\u03c9) \u223c\nTK\np\nFrom this result, we get a T /TK temperature dependence of the conductance as T \u2192 0, which is a clear signature\nof the breakdown of the Fermi liquid [8] (see Fig. 6).\nIn order to emphasize the deep difference between single-channel and many-channel Kondo effect in the T = 0\nlimit we just mention here that the imaginary part of the proper self-energy, close to the Fermi surface, behaves\nas Im\u03a3(k, \u03c9) \u221d Ck \u03c9 2 (where the chemical potential \u03bc = 0 is taken as reference energy) in the Fermi liquid case\n1\nand in the single channel Kondo problem. On the contrary, it behaves as Im\u03a3(k, \u03c9) \u221d Ck\u2032 \u03c9 2 in the two channel\n\"overscreened\" Kondo problem. In the following we refer, for simplicity, to the two channel \"overscreened\" case.\nThrough the Kramers-Kronig relation\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u2202\u03c9 Im\u03a3(k, \u03c9 \u2032 )\n\u2202\nRe\u03a3(k, \u03c9) = \u2212 P\n(53)\nd\u03c9 \u2032\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\u2032 \u2212 \u03c9\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2202\nwe see that \u2202\u03c9\nRe\u03a3(k, \u03c9)|\u03c9\u21920 is finite in the first case, at the Fermi surface, on the contrary it has a power law\ndivergence in the second case. It follows that the quasiparticle pole residue zk = [1 \u2212 \u2202\u03c9 \u03a3(k, \u03c9)]\u22121 |\u03c9\u21920 vanishes as a\npower law in the second case at the Fermi surface. Luttinger [54] showed that, to all orders of perturbation theory\nin the interaction, the imaginary part of the proper self-energy behaves as Im\u03a3(k, \u03c9) \u221d Ck \u03c9 2 (Ck > 0) close to the\nFermi surface, which implies an infinite lifetime for the quasiparticles at the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is sharp\nand well defined. These are the foundation stones of the normal Fermi liquid Theory and they are invalidated in the\nspin- 21 two channel Kondo case.\n\n15\n\n\fIn this Section we focus, in particular, on two channel spin-1/2 Kondo effect in both the perturbative region and the\nunitarity limit. We describe the scaling perturbative approach and the bosonization (T \u223c 0) technique, respectively.\nAn attempt to extend the Anderson-Yuval approach of Section IV.C to the two channel Kondo case can be found in\n[42].\nA. Perturbative analysis at T >> TK\n\nThe starting point of our reasoning is the effective Hamiltonian given in eq. (35), which we will take in the isotropic\nlimit. In the following we will restrict our analysis to a two-fold degenerate dot level. In this case, as we pointed out,\nthe QD can be modelized as a spin-1/2 magnetic impurity, whose spin is given by:\nSda =\n\n1 \u2020 a\nd \u03c4 \u2032d \u2032\n2 \u03b3 \u03b3\u03b3 \u03b3\n\n~d is a spin-1/2 comes out from the identity S\n~ 2 = 3/4, valid in the case of single-occupancy for the dot's level).\n(that S\nd\nIn this case and for a generic number of channels for the itinerant electrons, eq.

Infrared\ndivergent diagrams provide a flow of J as a function of T . We are now going to derive the perturbative \u03b2-function at\nthird order in J. At finite T the Green function in Fourier space will depend on the momentum of the particles and\n1\non the Matsubara frequencies \u03c9m = 2\u03c0\n\u03b2 (m + 2 ) (for fermions).

The sums over Matsubara frequencies can be calculated by\nusing the standard techniques described, for example, in [55]. In the low-energy limit for the electrons from the leads\n(that is, if only excitations about the Fermi level are taken into account), the sum of the two diagrams is given by:\nD1 + D2 \u2248 \u2212i\n\nD\nJ2\na\na\na\na\n\u03b4\u03b3\u03b3 \u2032 {[\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 + \u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\n)\n\u2032 ] + [\u2212\u03b4\n\u2032\u03c4\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 + \u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 ]}2\u03bd (0) ln(\n\u03b1\u03b1\n8\nkB T\n\n(58)\n\n(D is an ultraviolet cutoff, identified with the width of the conduction band).

The only \"new\" contribution comes from the \"non-parquet\" diagram shown in Fig. 8. Because of the loop over\n16\n\n\fthe fermions from the contacts, such a contribution carries an overall factor of K, that is, the diagram is proportional\nto the number of channels and the correction to the coupling constant up to third-order in J is:\n2\n\n\u2206(3) J = (2\u03bd (0) J 2 \u2212 2K (\u03bd (0)) J 3 ) ln(\n\nD\n).\nkB T\n\nIntegration of the renormalization group equation for J provides:\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\nK\n1\n1\nj 1 \u2212 Kj0\n= x \u2212 x0\n+\nln\n\u2212 +\n2j\n2j0\n2\nj0 1 \u2212 Kj\n\n(60)\n\n(61)\n\nwhere j = \u03bd (0) J and x = ln( kBDT ).\nIt is seen from eq. (61) that the fixed point is reached at an intermediate coupling j \u2217 . However, the perturbative RG\nanalysis is not conclusive here, because even in the ordinary, single channel, Kondo model an artificial intermediate\ncoupling fixed point is produced when the perturbative RG equations are expanded to 3rd order [56].\nIt is straightforward to infer the Kondo temperature TK from eq. (61). Usually TK is defined as the temperature\nscale at which j becomes O(1). Following such a criterion, at T = TK we can neglect 1/j compared to 1/j0 and\nobtain the following approximate formula for TK :\nK\n\n1\n\nkB TK \u2248 D(j0 ) 2 e\u2212 2j0 .\n\n(62)\n\nEq. (62) is quite general, in that it provides the value for the crossover temperature for any number of channels\nK. This proves that the way the system approaches the scale at which the perturbative analysis breaks down does\nnot depend on the number of channels, except for a redefinition of the Kondo temperature. Hence, logarithmic\ndivergencies are expected when approaching to the TK , no matter on what the number of channels is. In the next\nsubsection we will analyze the T = 0 behavior of such a system, and will see that it is dramatically different from\nthe one channel case for what concerns the fixed-point properties.\nB. Analysis at T \u223c 0\n\nSeveral techniques have been applied in order to get informations about physical quantities around the fixed point\nin the Kondo regime in such a limit. Finite-T corrections have been derived by means of bosonization techniques\n[57] [58], of Bethe-ansatz like exact solutions [7] and of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) techniques [8]. Now, CFT\napproach is extremely effective in calculating finite-T corrections, Wilson ratios and other exact results concerning\nGreen functions [8], but its starting point that charge, spin and \"flavor\" quantum numbers are enough to identify a\nprimary fermionic field in the theory leads to an inconsistency: the corresponding on-shell S matrix comes out to be\n0. The solution to such an \"unitarity paradox\" has been suggested by Ludwig and Maldacena [59], who introduced\na fourth \"spin-flavor\" quantum number. So, while at the unitarity limit charge, spin and flavor do not change upon\nscattering off the impurity, the spin-flavor changes, giving rise to one more scattering channel. Such an extra quantum\nnumber allows for an off-diagonal on-shell S matrix, therefore the unitarity paradox simply means that the diagonal\nelements of the S matrix with respect to the spin-flavor number are 0. However, a theory of the unitarity limit, needed\nin order to compute, for instance, within an unified framework transport properties with finite-T corrections, is not\nyet fully developed. In this subsection we briefly sketch the first steps in order to derive an appropriate scattering\npotential a' la Nozi\u00e9res, in the case of two channel spin-1/2 overscreened Kondo effect. We follow an approach\nequivalent to the one by Tsvelick [60], that is the introduction of a regularization procedure able to move the fixed\npoint toward infinite-coupling. Then, we go through a bosonization - refermionization in order to account for the\nscattering processes with changing of the spin-flavor. The bosonization procedure allows us to split the degrees of\nfreedom involved in our problem: in this way we will show that the Kondo interaction involves only the spin and\nspin-flavor degrees of freedom while the charge and flavor ones are fully decoupled. This remark is a crucial one\nbecause it makes possible to derive a S matrix in the unitarity limit which comes out to be diagonal in any quantum\nnumber, but the spin-flavor; such a S matrix describes the whole system of dot and contacts.\nIn the following we discuss the case K = 2, S = 1/2, so we have two flavors of conduction electrons from an\neffectively one-dimensional conductor which interact with a localized spin\u22121/2 magnetic impurity.\nLet c\u03b1\u03c3 (x) be the lead electron operators (\u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 is the spin index, \u03b1 = 1, 2 is the flavor index). A lattice-model\ncomplete Hamiltonian is written as:\n\n17\n\n\fH 2Ch = \u2212t\n\nX\n[c\u2020\u03b1\u03c3 (x)c\u03b1\u03c3 (x + a) + c\u2020\u03b1\u03c3 (x + a)c\u03b1\u03c3 (x)]\n\n\u2212\u03bc\n\nx\n\nX\nx\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\nc\u2020\u03b1\u03c3 (x)c\u03b1\u03c3 (x) + J S d *[~\u03c31 (0) + ~\u03c32 (0)]\n\n(63)\n\nwhere ~\u03c3\u03b1 (x) = 21 c\u2020\u03b1\u03c3 (x)~\u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 c\u03b1\u03c3\u2032 (x) and a is the lattice spacing.\nNow, we can linearize the dispersion relation around the Fermi surface and introduce two chiral fields c\u00b1,\u03b1\u03c3 (x).\nEven and odd parities can be introduced to obtain fields with the same chirality, \u03c6e\u03b1\u03c3 and \u03c6o\u03b1\u03c3 , so odd parity fully\ndecouples from the interaction Hamiltonian. In order to properly deal with the interacting fields, we will bosonize \u03c6e\u03b1\u03c3 ;\nin particular, we define four bosonic fields \u03a8\u03b1\u03c3 in terms of which it is possible to express densities of the remarkable\nphysical quantities. To this end we are led to construct the four bosonic fields \u03a8X (X =ch,sp,fl,sf) for the charge,\nspin, flavor and spin-flavor degrees of freedom [58] [59] [61] as linear combinations of the previous ones.\nIn this way it is possible to realize two \"inequivalent\" representations of the fields \u03c6e\u03b1\u03c3 in terms of the fields \u03a8X\n(X =ch,sp,fl,sf), \u03c6e\u03b1\u03c3;I and \u03c6e\u03b1\u03c3;II , given by:\ni\n\n\u03c6e\u03b1\u03c3;I (x) = \u03b7\u03b1\u03c3 : e\u2212 2 [\u03a8ch +\u03c3\u03a8sp +\u03b1\u03a8fl +\u03b1\u03c3\u03a8sf ](x) :\ni\n\n\u03c6e\u03b1\u03c3;II (x) = \u03be\u03b1\u03c3 : e\u2212 2 [\u03a8ch +\u03c3\u03a8sp +\u03b1\u03a8fl \u2212\u03b1\u03c3\u03a8sf ](x) :\n\n(64)\n\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03be are suitable Klein factors. Notice that the two fields differ only in the spin-flavor quantum number but\nsuch a difference is a crucial one.\nNow we are ready to rewrite the two channel Kondo interaction Hamiltonian in bosonic coordinates \u03a8X as:\n\u001b\n\u001a\nL d\u03a8sp (0)\n2Ch\nHK\n= J Sd+ : e\u2212i\u03a8sp (0) :: cos(\u03a8sf (0)) : +Sd\u2212 : ei\u03a8sp (0) :: cos(\u03a8sf (0)) : +Sdz\n2\u03c0 dx\n\u2192 ~\n\u2212\n~\n= J S d *[\u03a3g (0) + \u03a3u (0)]\n(65)\n~ A,B (x) are given by:\nwhere the spin densities \u03a3\nL d\n[\u03a8sp + \u03a8sf ](x),\n4\u03c0 dx\nL d\n[\u03a8sp \u2212 \u03a8sf ](x).\n\u03a3zu (x) =\n4\u03c0 dx\n\n\u00b1i[\u03a8sp +\u03a8sf ](x)\n\u03a3\u00b1\n:\ng (x) = : e\n\n\u03a3zg (x) =\n\n\u00b1i[\u03a8sp \u2212\u03a8sf ](x)\n\u03a3\u00b1\n:\nu (x) = : e\n\n(66)\n\n~ g (x) and \u03a3\n~ u (x) are SU (2) spin current operators, so the vector space is made of the bosonic vacuum |bvaci\nBoth \u03a3\nand the bosonic spin\u2212 12 spinors at a point x:\ni\n\n|\u03c3g i \u2261 : e\u03c3 2 [\u03a8sp +\u03a8sf ](x) : |bvaci\ni\n\n|\u03c3u i \u2261 : e\u03c3 2 [\u03a8sp \u2212\u03a8sf ](x) : |bvaci.\n~ g,u =\nNo triplet adding up g and u spin species together can occur because, given \u03a3\n~ g |\u03c3u i = 0\n\u03a3\n\n~ u |\u03c3g i = 0,\n\u03a3\n\n(67)\nR L/2\n\n\u2212L/2 dx\n\n~ g,u (x), we have:\n:\u03a3\n(68)\n\n~ g is 6= 0, then, at the same point, the spin density associated\nthat is, if at a point x the spin density associated to \u03a3\n~\nto \u03a3u is = 0, and vice versa; this does not allow for overscreening. Such a statement is a crucial one, indeed it\ncorresponds to a particular regularization scheme [60] able to move the finite-coupling fixed point corresponding to\nthe unitarity limit down to J = +\u221e. At this infinitely-strongly coupled fixed point the impurity spin will be fully\nscreened in a localized spin singlet. In principle, the system might lay within any linear combination mixing the two\nrepresentations g, u, of the form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n| \u2193g i + \u03bc| \u2193u i\n| \u2191g i + \u03bc| \u2191u i\n\u2212 | \u21d3i \u2297\n(69)\n|GSi\u03bc |x=0 = | \u21d1i \u2297\n2\n2\nx=0\nx=0\nwhere | \u21d1i, | \u21d3i are the two impurity states with opposite spin polarizations. Then we search for the two independent\nlinear combinations that do not change upon scattering of lead electrons; it can be shown that such combinations\ncorrespond to the values \u03bc = \u00b1i.\n18\n\n\fNow, in the fixed point limit, we \"refermionize\". Physical states mix both representations,\nby the impurity states should conserve all physical quantum numbers. It can be shown that\nin the unitarity limit swaps the two inequivalent representations I \u2212 II of the lead electrons.\nimpurity absorbs/emits one spin-flavor quantum.

Finally, the conductance can be easily\nobtained by the Landauer formula using eq.

This leads to a zero temperature entropy for the impurity given by Simp (0) = 12 ln 2.\nTemperature corrections to this result have also been calculated [60] by using real fermion coordinates (Majorana\nfermions) \u03c8 a (x)(a = 1, 2, 3), which obey the anticommutation relations {\u03c8 a (x), \u03c8 b (y)} = \u03b4 ab \u03b4(x \u2212 y), describing the\nrelevant coordinates\n\u221a only. This corresponds as well to a regularization scheme where the fixed point has been moved\nto J = \u221e. The T behavior is recovered, as metioned in the introduction to this Section (see eq.(52)).\nC. Can we reach the two channel Kondo fixed point in a quantum dot ?\n\nA possible experimental realization of the two-channel Kondo fixed point in a quantum dot has been recently\nproposed [24]: exact diagonalization results of a vertical quantum dot with five electrons show that it can be tuned,\nby means of a strong external magnetic field, at the degeneracy point between energy levels with S = 1/2, but with\ndifferent orbital angular momentum. Vertical cylindrical contacts provide single particle energy subbands labeled by\nthe cross-sectional angular momentum and the k vector of the incoming/outgoing electron. Appropriate tuning of\nthe electron density in the contacts offers the chance of including two electron channels only. The advantage of this\nsetting is that no exchange coupling can take place between the channels due to symmetry, so that they act as totally\nindependent. Selection rules due to the cylindrical symmetry enforce angular momentum m conservation and spin\ncomponent \u03c3 conservation in the cotunneling processes. For the special setting of the proposed device only a hole (h)\nprocess for \u2193 \u2212spin and a particle process for \u2191 \u2212spin are allowed. They differ in the sign of the potential scattering\nbut this difference is inessential. In fact, a particle-hole transformation on the fermion fields of the \u2191 channel only\nreverses the unwanted sign without affecting the exchange coupling. This puts both channels on an equal footing and\npoints to an \"orbital\" Kondo coupling where the spin acts as the label for the channel. At this stage the dot plays\nthe role of an effective spin 3/2 impurity, interacting with two channels. So, as it stands the system would flow to an\nunderscreend situation in lowering the temperature. However, provided that Zeeman spin splitting \u2206 is larger than\nu\nthe Kondo temperature for the underscreened fixed point TK\n, there is a crossover temperature T c at which two of\nthe four S = 1/2 states are ruled out of the cotunneling processes, thus allowing for an effective spin 1/2 two channel\nKondo flow.\nDetecting the effect requires an appropriate control of the hybridization of the dot with the contacts (so that\nu\n\u2206 >> TK\n) and a proper tuning of the gate voltage Vg . This allows for fine tuning of the exchange couplings between\nthe dot and the two channels. It is well known that the hardest condition to be realized is total equivalence of the\nchannels in the coupling. Were this not the case, the system would prefer one of the two channels as the dominant\none and flow to a more conventional one-channel Kondo state. By tuning Vg one can cross the point where the two\nchannels are equally coupled which allows for scaling towards the two-channel fixed point. The measured conductance\ng (T ) vs T will exhibit quadratic behavior at low temperature except for a crossover to a square root behavior, at\nthe appropriate Vg value which makes the two channels perfectly equivalent (see Fig. 6). The delicate point in this\nproposal is that the requirement of full cylindrical symmetry of the device is essential.\nAnother setup for measuring the two channel Kondo conductance has been proposed recently [25]. This proposal\nrelies on an extra contact to provide the second channel. It is recognized however that this would introduce cross\nexchange terms between the three leads which do not allow for equivalent coupling of the two channels. In fact, any\n19\n\n\fdiagonalization of the scattering problem of the kind of the one outlined in the previous Subsection to isolate the\nindependent channels can never produce equal coupling as long as off-diagonal terms are non zero. To overcome this\ndifficulty the authors propose that the extra contact is a larger dot itself, having a charging energy Ec which hinders\nexchange coupling with the other two leads. Of course its size should be appropriately tuned. A smaller size implies\na larger level spacing \u03b4 inside it and \u03b4 should be low enough because it acts as the low energy cutoff in the scaling\ntoward the fixed point. Therefore, there is a delicate trade-off between incresing Ec to prevent cross exchange terms\nand decreasing \u03b4 not to stop the flow when reducing the temperature.\nWe have stressed that the NFL fixed point in the two channel Kondo coupling at T = 0 can only be reached by\ntuning the exchange couplings of both channels J1 , J2 exactly equal. Hopefully this can be done by changing an\nappropriate gate voltage across a critical point Vg\u2217 . According to Fig. 4 the systems flows to J1 \u2192 \u221e, J2 \u2192 0 for\nVg < Vg\u2217 and to J2 \u2192 \u221e, J1 \u2192 0 for Vg > Vg\u2217 , both of which are Fermi liquid fixed points. It has been argued\nthat the quantum transition across Vg\u2217 should display a quantum critical region in the T \u2212 Vg plane whose critical\nproperties can be determined [26]. This offers better chances to spot whether we are in the vicinity of the NFL fixed\npoint or not, also at finite temperature.\nVIII. SUMMARY\n\nIn this review we focused on equilibrium transport properties across a quantum dot (QD). A QD is a tunneling\ncenter for electrons coming from the leads. Depending on the transparency of the barriers and on the temperature,\nthe coupling V to the leads is weak or strong.\nIn the weak coupling regime, tunneling can be dealt with perturbatively. In the case of the QD, a Coulomb Blockade\nzone is delimited by two sharp conduction peaks which grow as |V |2 /T in lowering the temperature. Conduction\ninbetween is due to cotunneling processes and is exponentially damped in temperature. Differential conductance is\nquite small, being \u221d |V |4 /U , so that the charge degree of freedom is freezed on the dot.\nIn lowering the temperature, non perturbative coupling of the dot to the delocalized electrons of the contacts can\noccur and conductance can reach the unitary limit in a CB valley. For pedagogical reasons we have reviewed the\nold-fashoned Anderson-Yuval model for the correlated state. Otherwise we have used the poor man's scaling approach\nin the regime where perturbative scaling applies and the Nozi\u00e9res scattering approach which entails the fixed point\nphysics at zero temperature. These approaches do not allow for quantitative results which are better obtained with\nthe numerical renormalization group (NRG), real time RG and Non Crossing Approximation (NCA) (the last one\npreferably in the overscreened case when a non Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point is reached), but they offer a more\ntransparent view of what is going on.\nWe have briefly reviewed the various types of Kondo couplings.\nWe have considered the case in which the GS of the dot is degenerate because of spin: if temperature is low enough\n(T < TK , with TK depending on the transparency of the barriers), spin flip processes proliferate and the magnetic\nmoment of the dot is partially or fully screened . In this case an applied magnetic field has a disruptive effect on the\nKondo peak of the conductance. The interesting case of a crossing between different dot spin states induced by the\nmagnetic field has been also discussed.\nWe have also reported on other possible realizations of Kondo physics involving orbital degrees of freedom (orbital\nKondo). The most favourable set up for this case is a vertical geometry of the dot and the contacts with cylindrical\nsymmetry. In this geometry a magnetic field orthogonal to the dot (which may be strong) can induce level crossings\nand produce the degeneracies of the dot GS which is required for Kondo conductance to take place. Hence one can\nhave Kondo effect also with an even number of electrons on the dot and zero total spin.\nSome attention has been devoted to the multichannel Kondo effect. The overscreening case can lead to a NFL\nfixed point at zero temperature. In particular we have discussed the two channel spin 1/2 Kondo state and reported\non possible experimental realizations that have been proposed. It emerges that conditions to be met are very tough.\nNonetheless its achievement would probe a beautiful piece of the physics of the strongly correlated systems.\nIX. APPENDIX A: RG EQUATIONS FOR THE COULOMB GAS MODEL OF EQ. (29)\n\nWe summarize here the scaling of the action in eq. (29) in order to find out the behaviour of the system at large time\nscales (low temperature) [21] [34]. The cutoff is rescaled according to: \u03c4M \u2192 (1 + \u03bb)\u03c4M with \u03bb = \u2206\u03c4M /\u03c4M \u2192 d ln \u03c4M .\n2\n2N\nin the denominator, while the one \u221d \u03b12 arises from\nThis adds a factor e\u22122N \u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1 /2) . The first term arises from \u03c4M\n20\n\n\fP\nP\nP\nthe ln \u2212 term in the interaction term. Indeed charge neutrality implies that 0 = ( i qi )2 = i6=j qi qj + i qi2 and\nqi,j = \u00b11. This factor renormalizes the fugacity Y \u2192 Y + dY , with:\n2\n\nY + dY \u2248 Y e\u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1\n\n/2)\n\n,\n\n(72)\n\nwhat gives the first of eqs. (30). The interaction strength \u03b1 is renormalized by flip-antiflip (particle-antiparticle)\nfusion.\nLet us consider now all the configurations in which pairs of neighboring charges qi at \u03c4i and qj = \u2212qi at \u03c4j (where\nj = i \u00b1 1) are at a distance between \u03c4M and \u03c4M (1 + \u03bb). In increasing the scale, these pairs are seen as a neutral\ncompound which screens the interaction between other charges (\"fusion \" of pairs). Let us consider one single fusion\nprocess and develop that part of the action that contains their coordinates:\n\u01eb\n\u2212S (2N +2) = \u2212S (2N ) + qi qj ln\n\u03c4M\n\u0015\n\u0014\nqi X\n\u03c4k \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 \u01eb/2\n\u03c4k \u2212 \u03c4 + \u01eb/2\n+\n.\n\u2212 ln\nqk ln\n2\n\u03c4M\n\u03c4M\n\n(73)\n\nk6=i,j\n\n\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4j\n\nHere we have defined \u01eb/2 = i 2\npartition function of eq.

This generates an extra contribution to the action that can be interpreted\nas the renormalization of the coupling constant:\n\nBecause \u03bb \u2248 d ln \u03c4M , the second one of eqs. (30) is obtained.\nX. APPENDIX B: TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE CONDUCTANCE\n\nOhm's law can be derived semiclassically from a Boltzmann equation which accounts for weak scattering of the\ncharge carriers against impurities and defects, when driven by an electric field. Scattering provides a mechanism for\nrelaxation from a non equilibrium to a steady state flow [62]. We follow here a simplified approach starting from the\n~ k /h\u0304. The current density is:\nvelocity of band electrons ~vk = \u2207\u01eb\n~j = \u2212 2e\n3V\n\nX\nk\n\n~vk (fk \u2212 fko )\n\n(76)\n\nwhere fk (fko ) is the non-equilibrium (equilibrium) Fermi distribution and V is the volume. Now we take:\nfk \u2212 fko = \u2212\n\n\u2202f o\n\u03b4\u01ebk\n\u2202\u01ebk\n\n~ vk \u03c4 (k),\n\u03b4\u01ebk = \u2212eE*~\n\n(77)\n\nwhich defines the relaxation time \u03c4 (k), so that, according to Ohm's law, we get:\n\u03c3=\u2212\n\n\u2202f o\n2e2 X\n.\n~vk *~vk \u03c4 (k)\n3V\n\u2202\u01ebk\n\n(78)\n\nk\n\nIn th case of s\u2212 wave scattering a spherical wave is diffracted from the impurity with maximum amplitude; this\nincreases the flux propagating backward. Assuming that quantities depend on \u01eb only and are mostly evaluated at the\nFermi level we have (T \u223c 0):\n21\n\n\f\u03c3=\u2212\n\n2e2\n\u03bd(0)vF2\n3V\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb \u03c4 (\u01eb, T )\n\n\u2202f o\n.\n\u2202\u01eb\n\n(79)\n\nIn this way we recover the simple microscopic formula for Ohm's conductivity, first derived by Drude in 1900,\n\u03c3 = ne2 \u03c4 /m, where \u03c4 is an average relaxation time. The latter can be defined in terms of the mean free path\nbetween two scattering events l = vF \u03c4 or distance between impurities. This formula is valid in the limit kF l >> 1\nwhich we assume to be the case. In such a limit no localization effects occur and one can show that it is d\u03c1/dT > 0\nalways, which is violated in the case of Kondo conductivity in diluted alloys.\nIn fact, for the large U Anderson model, the explicit dependence of the transport time on temperature at the\nFermi energy has to be taken into account separately. In addition, the Sommerfeld expansion can be used at finite\ntemperatures [10]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\nZ\n2\n\u2202f (\u01eb)\n\u03c02\n\u03c02\n1 2 2 \u03c02 2\n2d \u03c4\nd\u01eb \u2212\n\u03c4 (\u01eb, T ) = \u03c4 (\u03bc, T ) +\n= \u03c4 (\u03bc, 0) 1 +\n.\n(80)\n(kB T )\n\u03c0 T +\n3T\n2\n\u2202\u01eb\n6\nd\u01eb2 \u01eb=\u03bc\n16TK\n2\n6\nThe main ingredients to derive this formula are the Fermi liquid nature of the zero temperature GS and the Taylor\nexpansion of the temperature dependence of the relaxation time. The prefactors have been specialized to the case of\nthe symmetric Anderson model (so that the lifetime of the Kondo resonance is \u0393 = 4kB TK /\u03c0).\nIt follows that, in diluted alloys, the resistivity takes a maximum at T = 0:\n\u03c04 T 2\n\u03c1(T )\n=1\u2212\n2 .\n\u03c1(0)\n16TK\n\n(81)\n\nThe extra correction on the r.h.s. of eq. (80) arises from inelastic scattering at finite temperature, as shown by\nNozi\u00e9res [40], according to the following argument.\n1\nIn an elastic resonant scattering process at T = 0 is \u2212Im{t0 } = \u03bd(0)\u03c0\nsin2 \u03b4 0 . In a diffusive s\u2212wave scattering at\nfinite T , we have to consider the total relaxation rate, defined as:\nZ\nX\n2\u03c0\n1\n=\nNi \u03bd(0) d\u01ebk\u2032 \u03b4(\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebk\u2032 )| < k|t|k \u2032 > |2\nwkk\u2032 (1 \u2212 k*k \u2032 ) =\n\u03c4 (\u01eb)\nh\u0304\n\u2032\nk\n\n(s\u2212wave scattering implies that the correction k*k \u2032 averages to zero). The inelasticity can be accounted for by defining\nan effective elastic S\u2212matrix which is now no longer unitary and an effective phase shift which is different from the\none at T = 0.\nP\nP\n2\nThe full S\u2212matrix, instead, is of course unitary: 1 =\n\u03b2 |S\u03b1\u03b2 | \u2261\n\u03b2 [\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 2\u03c0i\u03bd(0)t\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(\u01eb\u03b1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 )][\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 +\nP\nP\n2\n2\n2\n\u2217\nelastic channels \u03b2 = \u03b1\n2\u03c0i\u03bd(0)t\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(\u01eb\u03b1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 )] =\n\u03b2 4\u03c0 (\u03bd(0)) |t\u03b1\u03b2 | \u03b4(\u01eb\u03b1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 ). Now, we separate the\n\u03b2 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 +\nP\nfrom the inelastic ones on the r.h.s. and we introduce the inelastic cross-section W\u03b1in = 2\u03c0 \u03b26=\u03b1 \u03bd(0)|t\u03b1\u03b2 |2 \u03b4(\u01eb\u03b1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 );\n2\nhence, from unitarity it follows that 1 + 4\u03c0 2 (\u03bd(0)) |t\u03b1\u03b1 |2 + 2\u03c0\u03bd(0)W\u03b1in = 1. Thus, we can define an effective phase\nshift (which we call \u03b4 again) in presence of inelastic scattering by introducing an effective \"elastic\" S matrix:\n1 \u2212 2\u03c0i\u03bd(0)t\u03b1\u03b1 = 1 \u2212 2\u03c0\u03bd(0)W\u03b1in\n\n\u0001 12\n\ne2i\u03b4 ,\n\n(82)\n\nwhere the square root can be expanded.\nAccording to the optical theorem, we can write the total transmission probability as:\nW\u03b1 = \u22122Im{t\u03b1\u03b1 } = W\u03b1in cos 2\u03b4 +\n\n(1 \u2212 cos 2\u03b4)\n.\n\u03bd(0)\u03c0\n\n(83)\n\nNow, let us notice that, because \u03b4 \u223c \u03c0/2, we have cos 2\u03b4 < 0. Therefore, for each channel \u03b1 the quantity W\u03b1 is always\nsmaller than the elastic case value: 2 sin2 \u03b4/(\u03bd(0)\u03c0). But one can thermally average over the \u03b1 channels; according\nto the usual phase space argument which is invoked when scattering occurs close to the Fermi surface at very low T ,\nwe obtain an average W in proportional to T 2 : W in \u223c AT 2 . This gives rise to the first term in the expansion of eq.\n(80). The second term can be viewed as contributing to the Sommerfeld expansion with \u03b4(\u01eb) = 12 \u03c0 \u2212 a\u01eb from which\nit follows that sin2 \u03b4 \u223c 1 \u2212 a2 \u01eb2 .\nIn the case of resonant tunneling across the dot, the conductance is given by eq. (20). Using the result of eq. (83)\ndirectly one obtains that conductance has a maximum at zero temperature and first corrections in temperature are\nagain of O(T 2 ) (see eq. (49)).\n22\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThis manuscript is the revised and updated version of the lectures delivered by one of us (A.

Conduction fermions are represented as full lines, while dashed\nlines represent propagation of d-fermions (dot's states).\n\u2022 Figure 8: Third-order vertex renormalization: the first one (P ) is a \"parquet-type\" diagram. Its contribution\nis accounted for in the integration of the second-order RG equation. The second one (N P ) is a \"non parquet\"\ndiagram. It provides an additional third-order contribution to the \u03b2-function.\n24\n\n\fdot\nB || z\nL\nVsd\n\nR\nVg\n\n25\n\n\f1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\nf(x)\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nx\n\nD\n\nD\n\n1\n\n26\n\n2\n\n\fP\n\nNP\n\n27\n\n\f"}
