This is due primarily to the nearly universal acceptance of the general\nimpossibility of secure quantum bit commitment (QBC), taken to be a consequence of the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type entanglement cheating which rules out QBC and other\nquantum protocols that have been proposed for various other cryptographic objectives [2].\nIn a bit commitment scheme, one party, Adam, provides another party, Babe, with a piece\nof evidence that he has chosen a bit b (0 or 1) which is committed to her. Later, Adam\nwould \"open\" the commitment: revealing the bit b to Babe and convincing her that it is\nindeed the committed bit with the evidence in her possession. The usual concrete example\nis for Adam to write down the bit on a piece of paper which is then locked in a safe to be\ngiven to Babe, while keeping for himself the safe key that can be presented later to open the\ncommitment. The evidence should be binding, i.e., Adam should not be able to change it,\nand hence the bit, after it is given to Babe. It should also be concealing, i.e., Babe should\nnot be able to tell from it what the bit b is. Otherwise, either Adam or Babe would be able\nto cheat successfully.\nIn standard cryptography, secure bit commitment is to be achieved either through a\ntrusted third party or by invoking an unproved assumption on the complexity of certain\ncomputational problem. By utilizing quantum effects, various QBC schemes not involving a\nthird party have been proposed that were supposed to be unconditionally secure, in the sense\nthat neither Adam nor Babe can cheat with any significant probability of success as a matter\nof physical laws. In 1995-1996, a general proof on the impossibility of unconditionally secure\nQBC and the insecurity of previously proposed protocols were described [3]-[6]. Henceforth,\nit has been accepted that secure QBC and related objectives are impossible as a matter of\nprinciple [7]-[8].\nThere is basically just one impossibility proof, which gives the EPR attacks for the cases of\nequal and unequal density operators that Babe has for the two different bit values. The proof\nshows that if Babe's successful cheating probability PcB is close to the value 1/2, which is\n3\n\n\fobtainable from pure guessing of the bit value, then Adam's successful cheating probability\nPcA is close to the perfect value 1. This result is stronger than the mere impossibility of\nunconditional security, namely that it is impossible to have both PcB \u223c 1/2 and PcA \u223c 0.\nSince there is no known characterization of all possible QBC protocols, logically there can\nreally be no general impossibility proof, strong or not, even if it were indeed impossible to\nhave an unconditionally secure QBC protocol. This problem of scope of the impossibility\nproof can be seen from the following simple example.\nSuppose Adam commits a state |\u03c6i of a single qubit (two-dimensional quantum state\nspace) for the bit value 0 and |\u03c6\u2032 i for 1. Adam opens by declaring the bit value, and Babe\nverifies by measuring the corresponding projection, |\u03c6ih\u03c6| or |\u03c6\u2032 ih\u03c6\u2032|. It is intuitively clear,\nbut will be formalized as local state invariance in this paper, that Adam can launch no\neffective EPR cheat. Of course, it is true in this case that if PcB \u223c 1/2 then |h\u03c6|\u03c6\u2032i|2 \u223c 1,\nso PcA \u223c 1 simply by declaring the bit value 1 even when |\u03c6i is committed. However, it is a\npriori possible for a protocol to have the property that PcB \u223c 1/2 while Adam cannot form\nany effective cheating entanglement as in this example but with PcA \u223c 0. To have a general\nimpossibility proof, one has to show that this property cannot be obtained in any QBC\nprotocol or that any unconditionally secure QBC protocol would contradict some known\nprinciple. The mere absence of counterexamples does not constitute a proof.\nThe general questions of scope of the impossibility proof will be addressed specifically\nin Section IV. Three QBC schemes not covered by the impossibility proof will be described\nin Sections V-VII, although only one of them, QBC2 in Section VI, is proved to be unconditionally secure in this papper. The results are developed within nonrelativistic quantum\nmechanics, unrelated to relativistic protocols [9] or cheat-sensitive protocols [10]. The essential point is that the flow of classical information between Adam and Babe in the protocol is\ncrucial to the possible operations they can carry out, hence fundamentally affecting the security level of the scheme. In the impossibility proof, it is basically assumed that both Adam\nand Babe possess full information at each stage of the protocol, an unwarranted assumption.\nIn Section II the impossibility proof will be reviewed. Since the issues involved in quantum cryptography, or classical cryptography for that matter, are often subtle, it is the policy\nof this paper to give complete proofs for its claims. Thus, the gap between the quantitative\n4\n\n\fimpossibility claim and the result available in the literature will be filled. An in-principle\ninsecure protocol QBC0 is also described that underlies QBC1 and QBC3. In Section III,\nthe impossibility proof in the original formulation is extended to cover the situation in\nwhich Babe applies a superoperator transformation to Adam's committed state before perfect verification. Another insecure protocol QBC01, related to QBC0, is described as an\nillustration. The reader who just wants to see an unconditionally secure QBC protocol can\ngo directly from Section II to Section VI. Note that the results in this paper are valid in\ninfinite-dimensional spaces. Also, the same index symbols i, j, etc., may denote different\nquantities in different sections.\n\n5\n\n\fII\n\nThe Impossibility Proof\n\nIn this Section we review the standard formulation of the impossibility proof and then recast\nit in a form more suitable for quantitative analysis and extension, and describe a protocol\nQBC0. The development of this section will be used in the rest of the paper.\nAccording to the impossibility proof, Adam would generate |\u03a60 i or |\u03a61 i depending on b\n= 0 or 1,\n|\u03a60 i =\n|\u03a61 i =\n\nX\u221a\ni\n\npi |ei i|\u03c6i i,\n\n(1)\n\nXq\n\np\u2032i |e\u2032i i|\u03c6\u2032i i\n\ni\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the states {|\u03c6i i} and {|\u03c6\u2032i i} in HB are openly known, i \u2208 {1, . . . , M}, {pi } and {p\u2032i }\nare known probabilities, while {|ei i} and {|e\u2032i i} are two complete orthonormal sets in HA .\nAll Dirac kets are normalized in this paper. Adam sends Babe HB while keeping HA to\nhimself. He opens by measuring the basis {|ei i} or {|e\u2032i i} in HA according to his committed\nstate |\u03a60 i or |\u03a61 i, resulting in a specific |\u03c6i i or |\u03c6\u2032 i i on HB , and telling Babe which i he\nhas obtained. Babe verifies by measuring the corresponding projector and will obtain the\nvalue 1 (yes) with probability 1. Adam can, as was argued, switch between |\u03a60 i and |\u03a61 i by\noperation on HA alone, and thus alter the evidence to suit his choice of b before opening the\nB\ncommitment. In the case \u03c1B\n0 \u2261 trA |\u03a60 ih\u03a60 | = \u03c11 \u2261 trA |\u03a61 ih\u03a61 |, the switching operation is\n\nto be obtained by using the so-called \"Schmidt decomposition [11],\" the expansion of |\u03a60 i\nB\nand |\u03a61 i in terms of the eigenstates |\u03c6\u0302k i of \u03c1B\n0 = \u03c11 with eigenvalues \u03bbk and the eigenstates\nA\n|\u00eak i and |\u00ea\u2032k i of \u03c1A\n0 and \u03c11 ,\n\n|\u03a60 i =\n\nXq\nk\n\n\u03bbk |\u00eak i|\u03c6\u0302k i,\n\n|\u03a61 i =\n\nXq\nk\n\n\u03bbk |\u00ea\u2032k i|\u03c6\u0302k i\n\n(3)\n\nBy applying a unitary U A that brings {|\u00eak i} to {|\u00ea\u2032k i}, Adam can select between |\u03a60 i or |\u03a61 i\nany time before he opens the commitment but after he supposedly commits. When \u03c1B\n0 and\nA\nto a |\u03a6\u03030 i\n\u03c1B\n1 are not equal but close, it was shown that one may transform |\u03a60 i by an U\nB\nwith |h\u03a61 |\u03a6\u03030 i| as close to 1 as \u03c1B\n0 is close to \u03c11 according to the fidelity F chosen, and thus\n\nthe state |\u03a6\u03030 i would serve as the effective EPR cheat.\nIn addition to the above quantitative relations, the gist of the impossibility proof is\nsupposed to lie in its generality \u2013 that any QBC protocol could be fitted into its formulation,\n6\n\n\fas a consequence of various arguments advanced in [3]-[8]. Among other reasons to be\nelaborated in Section IV, it appeared to the present author from his development of a new\ncryptographic tool, anonymous quantum key technique [12], that the impossibility proof is\nnot sufficiently general. First of all, there is no need for Adam to entangle anything in an\nhonest protocol. When Adam picks b=0, he can just send Babe a state |\u03c6i i with probability\npi . When he picks b=1, he sends |\u03c6\u2032i i with probability p\u2032i . If the anonymous key technique\nis employed, |\u03c6i i and |\u03c6\u2032i i are to be obtained from applying Ui or Ui\u2032 from some fixed openly\nknown set of unitary operators {Ui } and {Ui\u2032 } on HB by Adam to the states |\u03c8i sent to him\nby Babe and known only to her. As a consequence, Adam would not be able to determine\nthe cheating unitary transformation U A as in protocol QBC1, to be described in Section V\nafter the impossibility proof is first analyzed generally.\nIn a QBC protocol, the {|\u03c6i i} and {|\u03c6\u2032i i} are chosen so that they are concealing as evidence, i.e. Babe cannot reliably distinguish them in optimum binary hypothesis testing [13].\n(The role of quantum detection theory in QBC together with some new results used in this\npaper are elaborated in Appendix A). They would also be binding if Adam is honest and\nsends them as they are above, which he could not change after Babe receives them. Babe\ncan always guess the bit with a probability of success PcB = 1/2, while Adam should not\nbe able to change a committed bit at all. However, it is meaningful and common to grant\nunconditional security when the best P\u0304cB Babe can achieve is arbitrarily close to 1/2 and\nAdam's best probability of successfully changing a committed bit P\u0304cA is arbitrarily close to\nzero even when both parties have perfect technology and unlimited resources including unlimited computational power [4]. To facilitate the quantitative analysis of these performance\nmeasures, the impossibility proof would first be reformulated.\nBefore proceeding, note the following basic property of entanglement important in QBC.\nTheorem (Local State Invariance): Let \u03c1AB be a state on HA \u2297HB with marginal states \u03c1A \u2261\ntrB \u03c1AB , \u03c1B . The individual or combined effects of any state transformation and quantum\nmeasurement (averaged over the measurement results) on HA alone leaves \u03c1B invariant.\nSee Appendix B for a proof and a discussion of its role in the impossibility of superluminal\ncommunication via quantum entanglement.\nB\nAs a consequence of this theorem, Adam cannot cheat by changing the \u03c1B\n0 6= \u03c11 case to\n\n7\n\n\fB\nthe \u03c1B\n0 = \u03c11 case whatever the \u03c1's are. In particular, a single pure state as in the example\n\nof Section I cannot be changed.\nThe operation of unitary transformation with subsequent measurement of an orthonormal\nbasis is equivalent to the mere measurement of another orthonormal basis {|\u1ebdi i} on the\nsystem. Thus, the net cheating operation can be described by writing\n|\u03a60 i =\n\nXq\n\nq\n\np\u0303i |\u03c6\u0303i i \u2261\n\nfor a unitary matrix V defined by |ei i =\n\nP\n\np\u0303i |\u1ebdi i|\u03c6\u0303i i,\n\ni\n\nj\n\nX\u221a\nj\n\n(4)\n\npj Vji |\u03c6j i\n\n(5)\n\nVij |\u1ebdj i, and then measuring |\u1ebdi i. For convenience,\n\nwe may still in the rest of the paper refer to the cheating operation as a U A transformation\ndescribed at the beginning of this Section. Local state invariance is a property complementary to the fact that the |\u03c6\u0303i i obtainable by operation on HA alone are some proper linear\ncombinations of the |\u03c6i i from (5). The quantitative expression for PcA can now be given. If\nBabe verifies the individual |\u03c6\u2032i i, the Adam's successful cheating probability is\nPcA =\n\nX\ni\n\np\u0303i |h\u03c6\u0303i |\u03c6\u2032i i|2.\n\n(6)\n\nIn general, the optimal cheating probability P\u0304cB for Babe is given by the probability of\nB\ncorrect decision for optimally discriminating between two density operators \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 by\n\nany quantum measurement. From (A4) with p0 = 1/2,\n1\nB\nP\u0304cB = (2 + k\u03c1B\n0 \u2212 \u03c11 k1 )\n4\n\n(7)\n\nwhere k * k1 is the trace norm, k\u03c4 k1 \u2261 tr(\u03c4 \u2020 \u03c4 )1/2 , for a trace-class operator \u03c4 [14]. In terms\nof a security parameter n that can be made arbitrarily large ,the statement of unconditional\nsecurity (US) can be quantitatively expressed as\nlim\nP\u0304cB =\nn\n\n(US)\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\nlim\nP\u0304cA = 0.\nn\n\n(8)\n\nCondition (US) is equivalent to the statement that for any \u01eb > 0, there exists an n0 such\nthat for all n > n0 , P\u0304cB \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n< \u01eb and P\u0304cA < \u01eb, i.e. P\u0304cB \u2212\n8\n\n1\n2\n\nand P\u0304cA can both be made\n\n\farbitrarily small for sufficiently large n. The impossibility proof claims a lot more than the\nmere impossibility of (US), it asserts [4] the following statement (IP):\n(IP)\n\nlim P\u0304cB =\nn\n\n1\n2\n\n\u21d2\n\nlim P\u0304cA = 1.\n\n(9)\n\nn\n\nB\nB\nIn the \u03c1B\n0 = \u03c11 case, the EPR cheat shows that P\u0304c =\n\n1\n2\n\nimplies P\u0304cA = 1. Thus (IP)\n\ngeneralizes it to the assertion that the function P\u0304cA (P\u0304cB ), obtained by varying n, is continuous\nfrom above at P\u0304cB = 21 . Note the considerable difference between the truth of (IP) and the\nmuch weaker statement that (US) is impossible. In the middle ground that limn P\u0304cB =\n\n1\n2\n\nimplies just 0 < limn P\u0304cA < 1, the protocol would be concealing for Babe and cheat-sensitive\nfor Adam.\nThe key observation [3]-[4] in the proof of (IP) is the use of Uhlmann's theorem, that\nthere exist purifications |\u03a60 i and |\u03a61 i of any given \u03c10 and \u03c11 such that |h\u03a60 |\u03a61 i|2 attains the\nq\u221a\n\u221a 2\n\u03c10 \u03c11 \u03c10 . The conclusion is drawn,\nmaximum possible value given by F (\u03c10 , \u03c11 ) \u2261 tr\nB\nA\nwithout supporting details, that if F (\u03c1B\n0 , \u03c11 ) is close to 1, then so is P\u0304c . This conclusion\n\ncan be related to (IP) via the bound [15]\n2[1 \u2212\n\nq\n\nF (\u03c10 , \u03c11 )] \u2264 k\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c11 k1 .\n\n(10)\n\n\u01eb 2\nB\nB\nB\nas follows.

From Uhlmann's\n\ntheorem, choose |\u03a60 i and |\u03a61 i of (1)-(2) to be the purifications that achieve the maximum\n\n\u01eb\nB\nF (\u03c1B\n0 , \u03c11 ) so that |h\u03a60 |\u03a61 i| \u2265 1 \u2212 2 . The cheating operation on |\u03a60 i is given by (5), and\n\nAdam's successful cheating probability is given by the following\nLemma 1: For probabilities \u03b1i and complex numbers \u03bbi ,\n2\n\nX\ni\n\n2\n\n\u03b1i |\u03bbi | \u2265\n\nX\n\n(11)\n\n\u03b1i \u03bb i\n\ni\n\n(the sums can be over infinite sets).\nProof: When \u03bbi are real, (11) follows from Jensen's inequality [16] and the concavity of the\nfunction x 7\u2192 x2 . The complex case follows by expanding each \u03bbi into real and imaginary\nparts. \u2737\nSince h\u03a6\u03030 |\u03a61 i =\n\nP q\ni\n\np\u2032i p\u0303i h\u03c6\u0303i |\u03c6\u2032i i, it follows from (11) with \u03bbi =\n\nq\n\np\u0303i /p\u2032i h\u03c6\u0303i |\u03c6\u2032i i (no need to\n\ninclude the p\u2032i = 0 terms) and \u03b1i = p\u2032i that P\u0304cA \u2265 1 \u2212 \u01eb whenever P\u0304cB \u2264\n9\n\n1\n2\n\n+ 4\u01eb . Thus, the\n\n\fstatement (IP) is proved. In particular, one has the convergence rate\nP\u0304cB\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u21d2 P\u0304cA = 1 \u2212 O\n.\n= +O\n2\nn\nn\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n(12)\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following protocol, in which hashing via the parity funcB\ntion is used to make \u03c1B\n0 close to \u03c11 in a sequence generalization of the example in Section I.\n\nPROTOCOL QBC0:\n(i) Adam sends Babe a sequence of n qubits, each is either one of {|\u03c6i, |\u03c6\u2032i}, such that\nan even number of |\u03c6\u2032 i corresponds to b = 0 and an odd number to b = 1, with probability\n1/2n\u22121 for each sequence of either parity.\n(ii) Adam opens the commitment by revealing the sequence of n states. Babe verifies\nby measuring the corresponding projection on each qubit to see that the entire sequence is\ncorrect.\nB\nTo show that this scheme can be made concealing, note that \u03c1B\n0 \u2212 \u03c11 factorizes into\n\nproducts of individual qubit parts as follows. Let j = (j1 , . . . , jn ) \u2208 {0, 1}n , Pl0 = |\u03c6ih\u03c6|,\nPl1 = |\u03c6\u2032ih\u03c6\u2032 |, l \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Let \u039b0 = {j|\nand odd parity n-bit sets.

Appendix C),\nP\u0304cB =\nThus, P\u0304cB is close to\n\n1\n2\n\n1 1\n+ (1 \u2212 2pe )n .\n2 2\n\nexponentially in n independently of\n\n(15)\n1\n2\n\n\u2265 pe > 0. However, Adam\n\ncan now cheat by forming entanglement as in (1)-(2), with P\u0304cA exponentially close to 1 in\naccordance with (IP).\n10\n\n\fIII\n\nAn Extension of the Impossibility Proof\n\nIn this Section, a protocol QBC01 will be described in which Babe introduces a lossy transformation on Adam's committed state while still being able to verify perfectly. While it\nmay be argued that such transformation cannot succeed in obtaining a secure protocol on\nqualitative grounds, it may also be argued otherwise. Specifically, the coherence of the states\n(1)-(2) can be deliberately destroyed by Babe with such a CP map, reducing the entangled\nstates to incoherent superpositions in her observation space. It turns out that if she does\nthat, which she can emphatically do, the resulting condition on the number n of modes would\nnot fit with the other requirements of the protocol. Indeed, the impossibility proof will be\nextended to cover all such possibilities of Babe introducing a CP-map transformation.\nThe following protocol is closely related to QBC0.\nPROTOCOL QBC01.\n(i) Adam sends Babe a sequence of n states |\u03b1l i \u2208 HlB , HB =\n\nN\n\nl\n\nHlB , each |\u03b1l i being\n\neither one of two coherent states {|\u03b1i, |\u03b1\u2032i}, such that an even number of |\u03b1\u2032 i corresponds\nto b = 0 and an odd number to b = 1, with probability 1/2n\u22121 for each sequence of either\nparity.\n\u221a\n(ii) Babe splits each state |\u03b1l i to | \u03b7\u03b1l i on HlB , \u03b7 < 1.\n(iii) Adam opens the commitment by revealing the sequence of n states. Babe verifies\n\u221a\nby measuring the corresponding projection on each | \u03b7\u03b1l i to see that the entire sequence is\ncorrect.\nThe cheating transformation on this protocol would produce from (5) a superposition of\ncoherent states with large energy difference when |\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 | >> 1. As explained in version 2 of\nthis paper (v4-v6), such superpositions are supersensitive to loss [17]-[19], thus offering the\npossibility that a lossy transformation, which would not afect perfect verification on coherent\nstates, would destroy the necessary entanglement for Adam to cheat successfully. However,\nin this multimode situation, in order to destroy the coherence one needs to have a loss of one\nphoton per mode, not just one photon, and the protocol cannot be made secure. Indeed, this\ncondition on the destruction of coherence is what makes fault-tolerant quantum computing\nin the presence of loss possible.\n11\n\n\fWe now give the impossibility proof that defeats such a maneuver by Babe. Let JB be\nany completely positve (CP) map (superoperator) on density operators introduced by Babe.\nB\nB\nLet Xi1\nbe the measurement operator that perfectly verifies the b = 1 case given i, i.e. Xi1\n\nis the \u03a01 operator part of a POM for the \"1\" or \"not 1\" decision in quantum hypothesis\ntesting as described in Appendix A, with perfect verification corresponding to the condition\nB\ntrXi1\nJB |\u03c6\u2032i ih\u03c6\u2032i | = 1.\n\n(16)\n\nThe PcA then becomes\nPcA =\n\nX\ni\n\nB\np\u0303i trXi1\nJB |\u03c6\u0303i ih\u03c6\u0303i |.\n\n(17)\n\nThe following lemma and all other results in this paper are valid in infinite-dimensional\nspaces.\nLemma 2 [14]: For any bounded operator X and any trace-class operator \u03c4 ,\n|trX\u03c4 | \u2264 kXkk\u03c4 k1 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere k * k is the ordinary operator norm.\nB\nk \u2264 1, from (18) we get\nSince kXi1\n\nPcA \u2265 1 \u2212\nFrom the original PcA =\n\nP\n\ni\n\nX\ni\n\np\u0303i JB (|\u03c6\u0303i ih\u03c6\u0303i | \u2212 |\u03c6\u2032i ih\u03c6\u2032i |)\n\n1\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nB\np\u0303i |h\u03c6\u0303i |\u03c6\u2032i i|2 \u2265 1 \u2212 \u01eb for k\u03c1B\n0 \u2212 \u03c11 k \u2264 \u01eb proved in Section II, one\n\nobtains, by relating inner product and trace norm for pure states as in (A4)-(A5),\nX\ni\n\np\u0303i |\u03c6\u0303i ih\u03c6\u0303i | \u2212 |\u03c6\u2032i ih\u03c6\u2032i |\n\n2\n1\n\n\u2264 4\u01eb.\n\n(20)\n\nThe following theorem is actually valid for any positive trace-preserving map J .\nTheorem [20]:\nkJ (\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c11 )k1 \u2264 k\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c11 k1 .\nFrom (20) and (21),\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\u0010\n\np\u0303i JB |\u03c6\u0303i ih\u03c6\u0303i | \u2212 |\u03c6\u2032i ih\u03c6\u2032i |\nX\ni\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n2\n1\n\n\u2264 4\u01eb and, using (11),\n\np\u0303i JB \u03c6\u0303i ih\u03c6\u0303i | \u2212 |\u03c6\u2032i ih\u03c6\u2032i |\n\n12\n\n(21)\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n\n\u221a\n\u2264 2 \u01eb.\n\n(22)\n\n\f\u221a\nPutting (22) into (19) yields PcA \u2265 1 \u2212 2 \u01eb, completing the proof of (IP).

This point and the entanglement destruction strategy of protocol\nQBC01 will be exploited in protocol QBC3 of Section VII. These possibilities also suggest\nthat it is now appropriate to examine the assumptions underlying the impossibility proof.\n\n13\n\n\fIV\n\nThe Limited Scope of the Impossibility Proof\n\nThe generality of the scope of the impossibility proof is analyzed in this section on general\ngrounds. This is an important issue because unconditionally secure bit commitment is too\nuseful to give up easily, and the available impossibility proof has many weaknesses that\ncan be exploited for secure QBC protocols. At the very least, one may hope that hidden\nassumptions, perhaps practically valid, may be revealed. Indeed one such assumption is that\nthe quantum and classical communications involved are over a perfect channel, which should\nbe considered different from the assumption that the parties have perfect technology. This\nis a good assumption for some situations, but not others such as long-distance fiber-optic\ncommunications. Another example in which this assumption is not valid involves satelliteto-satellite optical communications where the receivers' fields of view have to be opened up,\nperhaps because the signals are deliberately spread, so that the sun's background contributes\na significant amount of noise. In both of these cases, one can stretch the meaning of \"perfect\ntechnology\" to say that no unavoidable classical disturbance needs to be present \u2013 say, by\nthrowing the sun to another galaxy. (And what about the cosmic background radiation?)\nBut then the relevance of such results to reality is quite questionable. In this paper, a perfect\nchannel is granted. Since it is widely believed that there is a complete impossibility proof in\nsuch a case, I would try to show otherwise independently of the protocols of the paper.\nThe major problem is, of course, to decide whether the formulation given in [3]-[8] is\nsufficiently broad to include all possible QBC protocols. Typically, one proves general impossibility by showing that any concretely suggested possibility would lead to a contradiction.\nThe simplest example is that the possibility of superluminal communication via quantum\nentanglement would contradict local state invariance (cf. Appendix B). Another example\nwould be the quantum no-clone theorem, where cloning contradicts unitarity on a sufficiently\nlarge Hilbert space [21] as well as quantum detection theory (cf. Appendix A). In von Neumann's famous no-hidden-variable theorem [22], a contradiction is derived from what he\nconsidered to be the requirements for a hidden-variable theory. Perhaps more significant\nand illuminating is the impossibility proof of certain geometric constructions by straightedge and compass developed in the first half of the nineteenth century, in which any such\n14\n\n\fconstruction is characterized by the membership of a certain number lying in a tower of\nquadratic extension fields [23]. This example is significant because it is nontrivial to capture\nenough of the essence of any straightedge-and-compass construction to be able to produce\na mathematical contradiction when the construction is impossible. Thus, for a general impossibility proof of unconditionally secure QBC, one would expect that the general essence\nof any such protocol would be extracted to yield a contradiction. Clearly the impossibility\nproof does not do that, but rather relies on the claim that any possible QBC protocol can be\nreduced to its formulation. It is not a priori impossible to exhaustively describe and classify\nall operations of a certain kind, say, in quantum key distribution one typically characterizes all possible attacks Eve can launch. However, it is much more difficult to characterize\nall possible protocols than all possible attacks for any cryptographic objective because an\narbitrary interactive flow of information between users is possible in a protocol. Indeed,\nno characterization of all protocols for a specific objective is known in standard (classical)\ncryptography. The scope problems of the impossibility proof are numbered as follows.\n(1) One justification for the all-encompassing nature of the formulation is that Adam is\nproceeding exactly as if he were honest, except right before opening, in carrying out his EPR\ncheat. This is not true because there is no need for him to entangle anything in an honest\nprotocol. He can just pick a |\u03c6i i or |\u03c6\u2032i i and send it.\n(2) Because of this, it is not clear why Adam must be able to form the entanglement he\nneeds for any possible protocol.\n(3) Furthermore, it is not clear why Adam must be able to determine the cheating\ntransformation, even apart from complexity questions, for any possible protocol. Protocol\nQBC1 of section V provides a direct challenge in this situation, while protocol QBC2 of\nSection VII can also be considered to pose this problem.\n(4) The formulation postpones any measurement to the end of the commitment phase\nand claims that it entails no loss of generality. But why wouldn't it affect the quantitative\ncheating probabilities? Protocol QBC2 provides an example in which the timing of the\nmeasurement has substantial consequence.\nB\n(5) The density operators \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 for Babe are not necessarily the marginal states\n\nobtained from the states generated by Adam because of Babe's possible lack of information,\n15\n\n\fa situation that is built into the protocol. Thus, Adam's EPR cheat may not correspond to\nB\nthe \u03c1B\n0 \u223c \u03c11 case. An example is provided by QBC2.\n\n(6) It is clearly possible to avoid EPR cheats, as in the example described in Section I.\nWhile (IP) holds in this case, it holds not because of EPR cheats. The question is: why\nis it that an EPR-cheat-free protocol necessarily cannot satisfy (US)? Protocol QBC2 is an\nexplicit example that (US) is possible in such a protocol.\n(7) It is not clear why perfect verification is necessary, the only performance measures\nhere being the cheating probabilities. This freedom in a QBC protocol is exploited in QBC3.\n(8) It is not clear why Babe is necessarily unable to destroy Adam's entanglement by her\naction alone. Despite the failure of QBC01 of Section III, this possibility is manifested in\nprotocol QBC3.\nThe list could be continued. Note that the burden is on the impossibility proof to resolve\nthese points in its favor with convincing arguments, which have not been provided. Indeed,\nall three protocols QBC1 to QBC3, and even protocol QBC01 to a lesser extent, lie outside\nthe framework of the impossibility proof, and no impossibility argument has been given for\nthis kind of protocols. While there are various underlying reasons on the limited scope of\nthe impossibility proof formulation, a major one is that the interactive flow of information\nbetween Adam and Babe may prevent cheating because of each party's lack of relevant\ninformation at any particular stage of the protocol. Such information flow is what makes\nthe Yao model of two-party protocols [24] not sufficiently specific to characterize all QBC\nprotocols, which he did not claim to have done. Furthermore, modification of the Yao model\nto have measurements at the end of the commitment phase, perhaps thought to be equivalent\nby the Lo-Popescu theorem [25], is not justified with the use of anonymous states because\nthe state needs to be known to guarantee the validity of that theorem. The basic problem of\na general impossibility proof lies in the characterization of the essence of any possible QBC\nprotocol that makes it insecure. The information flow problem that makes it so difficult to\ncharacterize all classical protocols surely carries over to the quantum domain.\nThere are well-known and widely accepted claims in the literature [26]-[27] that classical\nnoisy channels would make unconditionally secure bit commitment possible. While I believe\nthe specific protocols described in [26]-[27] are not proved unconditionally secure, I also be16\n\n\flieve unconditionally secure ones can indeed be based on noisy channels, a subject to be\ndiscussed elsewhere. Such results are not considered to be contradictory to the QBC impossibility proof presumably for the following reasons. First, classical noise is often thought to\nbe part of an imperfect channel, i.e. it does not have to be present in principle. Apart from\nthe points made at the beginning of this section, such a viewpoint is not correct. The quantum noise in any given quantum signaling scheme for classical communication, the minimum\namount of which is determined through the optimum quantum measurement via quantum\ndetection theory, is in principle unavoidable and functions exactly like classical noise in the\noptimal quantum detector [28]-[29]. As will be shown elsewhere, this crucial point opens\nup the possibility of developing unconditionally secure, practical, and efficient optical-speed\ncryptographic systems for all the standard cryptographic objectives via quantum states that\nare not superpositions of one another. Secondly, a truly classical noise system would not\nentail the possibility of quantum entanglement and EPR cheating. However, there are many\nways to suppress EPR cheats, such as the example in Section I and the QBC2 in Section\nVI. While it is not easy to restore unconditional security with such suppression in a perfect\nchannel, a noisy channel, even one created with quantum noise, would provide a powerful\nway for such restoration. Indeed, the development of such protocols will be the subject of a\nfuture treatment.\n\n17\n\n\fV\n\nProtocol QBC1\n\nIn this Section we consider the use of anonymous states in a QBC protocol which is essentially\nthe one in version 1 (v1-v3) of this paper. In this protocol QBC1, the bit value is encoded\nin the parity of a sequence as in QBC0 of Section II, except that each individual state is\nobtained with Adam applying the openly known U0 or U1 to the states |\u03c8i sent to him by\nBabe, corresponding to the 0 or 1 bit position in the sequence. For example, |\u03c8i could be any\nstate on a fixed great circle of the Bloch-Poincar\u00e9 sphere of a qubit, with U0 = I and U1 being\na rotation by a fixed angle on the great circle independently of the bit position, say with\nh\u03c8|U1\u2020 U0 |\u03c8i = \u03bb > 0. See Ref. [12] for further discussion of anonymous-key cryptography.\nCoherent-state implementation is also possible, as in QBC01.\nPROTOCOL QBC1:\n(i) Babe sends Adam a sequence of n qubit states |\u03c8l i \u2208 HlB , HB =\nunknown to Adam.\n\nN\n\nl\n\nHlB , l \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\n\n(ii) Adam commits via the parity of the sequence j = (j1 , . . . , jn ) \u2208 {0, 1}n by applying\n\nUljl to |\u03c8l i for openly known Ul0 and Ul1 , with h\u03c8l |Ul1\u2020 Ul0 |\u03c8l i = \u03bb > 0 independently of l.\n(iii) Adam opens by revealing his j sequence. Babe checks every state Uljl |\u03c8l i.\n\nThis scheme can be made concealing exactly as in QBC0, (14)-(15). As for its binding\nbehavior, consider first the situation in which Adam can only entangle each qubit individually. He cannot switch any committed Ul0 |\u03c8l i or Ul1 |\u03c8l i to any other state due to local state\ninvariance which applies to each of the states he sends separately for that state, expressing\nthe obvious fact that there is no entanglement to a single state. If he were to entangle Ul0 |\u03c8l i\nor Ul1 |\u03c8l i to another state anyway, he would just present a mixed state for that qubit to\nBabe for that jl . In this case, a different criterion needs to be used as discussed below. If\nhe sticks to committing first a correct state for the bit, the best cheating probability he can\nget it\n2\n\nPcA = h\u03c8l |Ul1\u2020 Ul0 |\u03c8l i = \u03bb2\n\n(23)\n\nby generating any sequence of n \u2212 1 states, picking the last one for the bit commitment, and\ndeclaring it to be otherwise when desired. From (15) and (23), one can make PcA = O(m\u22121 )\nand P\u0304cB \u2212 1/2 = O(2\u2212m ) with n = O(m2 ). Hence unconditional security is obtained for\n18\n\n\flarge m if (23) is indeed the overall best Adam can do. In addition to PcA , one can use\nanother criterion, PaA , the average probability that Adam's committed evidence is accepted\nby Babe after he opens, which is always at least 1/2 similar to PcB with PaA = (1 + PcA )/2\nwhen (1) is used as an initial state |\u03a6\u03040 i by Adam. For a general |\u03a6\u03040 i, (6) can be simply\ngeneralized to give an expression for PaA with optimization for P\u0304aA to be performed also over\ninitial {\u03c60i i}, {p0i }. In the present situation, since single-qubit entanglement by Adam would\njust lead to a mixed presented state from local state invariance, P\u0304aA is obtained by a fixed\n|\u03c60i i = |\u03c60 i with P\u0304aA = (1 + \u03bb)/2. Thus, P\u0304cB \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n= O(2\u2212m ) and P\u0304aA \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n= O(m\u22121 ) are\n\nachieved for n = O(m3 ).\nAdam can, however, form the entanglement without knowing the |\u03c8l i's, by applying the\nunitary operator U on HA \u2297 HB ,\nU=\n\nX\ni\n\nwith initial state |Ai \u2208 HA satisfying\n\n\u221a\n\n|ei ihei | \u2297 Ui\n\n(24)\n\npi = hei |Ai, as was indicated in version 1 of this\n\npaper. On the other hand, contrary to the claim in that version, Adam can also entangle\nqubit by qubit via, for each i = (i1 , . . . , in ) in (25),\nUi =\n\nO\nl\n\nUlil = (I1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Unin ) . . . (Uii1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 In ).\n\n(25)\n\nBy applying (24)-(25), Adam can form the proper entangled state (1) or (2) without knowing\nthe |\u03c8l i's. However, he cannot determine the cheating transformation U A . In general such\nB\na cheating transformation for the \u03c1B\n0 6= \u03c11 case is determined by Uhlmann's theorem as\n\nfollows [30].\nB\nLet |\u03bbi i and |\u03bci i be the eigenstates of \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 with eigenvalues \u03bbi and \u03bci . The Schmidt\nB\nnormal forms of the purifications |\u03a60 i and |\u03a61 i of \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 are given by\n\n|\u03a60 i =\n|\u03a61 i =\n\nXq\n\n\u03bbi |fi i|\u03bbi i,\n\ni\n\nX\u221a\ni\n\n\u03bci |gi i|\u03bci i\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nfor complete orthonormal sets {|fi i} and {|gi i} on HA . Define the unitary operators U0 , U1\nand U2 by\nU0 |\u03bbi i = |\u03bci i,\n19\n\n(28)\n\n\fU1 |\u03bbi i = |fi i,\n\n(29)\n\nU2 |\u03bci i = |gi i.\n\n(30)\n\nSince one can always pick HA to be isomorphic to HB , one can identify them via the isomorphism. Let U be the unitary operator for the polar decomposition of\nq\n\nq\n\n\u03c1B\n\u03c1B\n0\n1 =\n\nq\n\nq\n\n\u03c1B\n\u03c1B\n0\n1 U.\n\nq\n\nq\n\n\u03c1B\n\u03c1B\n0\n1 [31],\n(31)\n\nB\nThen |h\u03a60 |\u03a61 i|2 assumes its maximum value F (\u03c1B\n0 , \u03c11 ) when\n\nUU2T U0 U0T U1T = I\n\n(32)\n\nB\n\u2032\nwhere T denotes the transpose operation. Thus, when \u03c1B\n0 , \u03c11 , and |ei i are given, |gi i = |ei i\n\nof |\u03a61 i is determined from (30) via solving for U from (32), which required detailed explicit\nB\nknowledge of \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 . In terms of the notation for (13)-(14), the density operators are\n\n\u03c1B\ni\n\n=\n\n1\n2n\u22121\n\nn\nX O\n\nj\u2208\u039bi l=1\n\nUljl |\u03c8l ih\u03c8l |Ulj\u2020 l\n\ni \u2208 {0, 1},\n\n(33)\n\nwhich is unknown to Adam through the |\u03c8l i uncertainty. If Adam picks a cheating transformation for a particular |\u03c8l i sequence, and then the |\u03c8l i sequence is randomly varied, it\nis easily seen that the resulting PcA can be very small, as e.g. when the corresponding oddparity state is actually of even parity. However, it is not easy to develop an unconditional\nsecurity proof because Adam has many other possible actions, including committing states\nwhich are not exactly correct for the bit value as mentioned above. Nevertheless, the protocol clearly shows in a simple way that the impossibility proof fails to work as intended.\nB\nB\nNote that this anonymous-key strategy also works in the case \u03c1B\n0 = \u03c11 if \u03c10 is not highly\n\ndegenerate, e.g., not proportional to the identity I B , such that its eigenstates cannot be\nB\nreadily determined as in the case of (33). Indeed, for n = \u221e the \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 from (33) are\n\nequal and not proportional to I B . Note that the strategy of this protocol, namely the use of\nanonymous states, is applicable to any QBC protocol, and will be employed next for protocol\nQBC2.\n\n20\n\n\fVI\n\nProtocol QBC2\n\nIn this section, protocol QBC2 is developed with a complete unconditional security proof by\nB\nexploting the following point: the states \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 that enter into (7) are not necessarily\n\nthe marginal states obtained from (1)-(2) due to Babe's lack of information built into a QBC\nprotocol. This situation is actually easy to obtain, but then Adam can usually cheat successfully with this information. The anonymous-key technique can be utilized to prevent both\nAdam and Babe from cheating to yield an unconditionally secure protocol to be explained\nin successive steps as follows.\nIn anonymous-key encryption [12], Babe transmits to Adam a state |\u03c8i only known to\nherself. Adam sends a bit b back to Babe via modulating |\u03c8i by openly known unitary\noperators Ub . For the present purpose, the following would suffice \u2013 |\u03c8i \u2208 S0 is one of the\nfour possible BB84 states of a qubit, S0 = {| \u2191i, | \u2192i, | \u0580i, | \u0581i}, (e.g. the vertically,\nhoritzontally, and diagonally polarized states). Adam sends back Ub |\u03c8i with U0 = I B and\nU1 being a clockwise rotation by \u03c0/2 on the polarization circle, so that Babe can always tell\nthe bit from the state. Let her send Adam a set S of the above four different states on four\nqubits in a random order known only to herself, with each state named by its order. Thus,\nS = {|\u03bb1 i1 , |\u03bb2 i2 , |\u03bb3 i3 , |\u03bb4 i4 } where the subscript j on | ij denotes the name of the state\nand {\u03bbj } is a random permutation of the set S0 = {\u2191, \u2192, \u0580, \u0581}. Adam picks randomly one\nof these four named states in S, keeping the name to himself, modulates it and sends it to\nBabe as the commitment. For example, he chooses |\u03bb2 i2 with subscript 2 on | i2 known to\nhim, rotates \u03bb2 unknown to him clockwise by \u03c0/2 for b = 1, and sends it back to Babe who\ndoes not know the state name \"2\" yet. He opens by revealing the state name and the bit\nB\nB\nvalue. Without knowing the state name, it is easy to check that \u03c1B\n0 = \u03c11 = I /2 for Babe.\n\nWhen she learns the state name from Adam's opening, she knows the corresponding state\nfor each bit value and can verify by measuring the corresponding projection. The actual\npermutation of the S0 -states in S has to be hidden from Adam because if he knows, he can\ncheat by committing any state in S and announcing it to be another appropriate state from\nS.\nConsider first Adam's possibility of cheating. When he picks a specific named state |\u03bbj ij ,\n21\n\n\fhe cannot apply the EPR cheat as a consequence of local state invariance or the fact that\nthere is no entanglement for a singla state. He can announce a different name of the state\nfrom the one he actually sent, with a probability of successfully reversing b (i.e. getting\nit accepted by Babe in her verification) given by 3/4.. He can use his own state instead\nof the one sent by Babe; the best way to do that is by trying to determine which name\ncorresponds to which state in S by optimally processing the set S from M-ary quantum\ndetection theory (cf. Appendix A). In each case he attains a probability of success bounded\naway from zero. Let pA be his maximum probability of success, which is determined by the\noptimal M-ary quantum detector because his openings amount to a decision making that\nconsists in matching each \u03bbj with an element of S0 . The exact value of pA is not relevant\nfor the security proof of our final protocol. The only relevant point here is that pA is a fixed\nnumber less than one. Hence, in an independent m-sequence, his probability of successful\ncheating, P\u0304cA = pm\nA , goes to zero exponentially in m.\nTo show that pA < 1, assume that Adam can cheat perfectly with pA = 1. This implies that he can determine \u03bbj for each |\u03bbj ij from the set S with certainty without knowing\nthe random permutation. However, the different possible permutations yield nonorthogonal\n(mixed) states on the different qubit sets. By Theorem A2 in Appendix A, pA = 1 is impossible. Indeed, the optimum pA is a fixed number bounded away from zero, not arbitrarily\nsmall in a parameter n that grows with the number of such randomly permuted four-state\nsets.\nIt is possible for Adam to consider EPR cheats by permuting the contents of the states to\nbe used later with a single qubit while keeping track of the state name. In this way, he can\nform the entanglement (1)-(2), but he cannot transform one into the other without knowing\nthe specific permutation of the \u03bbj in the set S presented to him. And, of course, if he knows\nthe permutation, he can cheat by proper announcement without the need for entanglement.\nNote also that if he can entangle and transform without knowing the actual permutation,\nlocal state invariance would be violated by permuting the states back to the given order.\nIndeed, this and all other possible attacks by Adam are accounted for in the above argument\nthat pA < 1 holds in any of Adam's possible cheating schemes as a consequence of optimum\nquantum detection theory.\n22\n\n\fThe only way that Babe can cheat is to send Adam a different set S \u2032 of states, e.g.\nthe same polarization state on the polarization circle for all four qubits, which would yield\nP\u0304cB = 1. This is to be prevented statistically via testing by having Babe send Adam a total\nnumber of n sets of S-states, all named by their order. Consider first the case in which\nAdam only commits a single qubit, and Babe sends a total of 4n states |\u03bbjl i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\nl \u2208 {1, . . . , 4}. If Babe is honest, then, for each j, {|\u03bbjl i} is a random permutation of S0 . To\nprevent Babe from cheating, Adam would randomly set aside one set j0 and ask Babe for the\nstate identities in the other n\u22121 sets. After Babe reveals the state identities from their names\nprovided by Adam, he can verify that Babe indeed sent him sets of proper states and proceed\nto pick one from the j0 set to commit his bit. If Babe sends a set S \u2032 = {|1i, |2i, |3i, |4i},\nwhich is not a random permutation of S0 , then there is a probability p1 that it will pass\nAdam's testing verification,\np1 = |h1| \u2191i|2 * |h2| \u2192i|2 * |h3| \u0580i|2 * |h4| \u0581i|2 ,\n\n(34)\n\nand a corresponding optimum probability p2 that Babe can determine the bit knowing the\nqubit is from S \u2032 . The value of p2 is determined by the optimum binary quantum detector.\nFor example, if Babe sends all states at the angle \u03c0/8 from \u2191, p1 = cos2\n\n\u03c0\n8\n\ncos2\n\n\u03c0\n8\n\ncos2\n\n3\u03c0\n8\n\nsin2\n\n\u03c0\n8\n\nand p2 = 1. As far as the existence of an unconditionally secure protocol is concerned, the\nonly thing we need to know is that p1 = 1 implies p2 =\n\n1\n2\n\nfrom (34). It is clear that any\n\nentanglement used by Babe on the state she sent would not help her cheat, because Adam is\ndoing everything on the individual qubit level determined by the individual marginal qubit\nstates. Indeed, Babe's entanglement would only make p2 smaller. For Babe to get P\u0304cB away\nfrom 21 , she needs to send state sets with p2 =\n\n1\n2\n\n+ \u01eb where \u01eb is bounded away from zero, i.e.\n\nnot arbitrarily small as a function of n, and send enough of them so that the chance that one\nof them is picked as j0 by Adam is also not arbitrarily small for large n. In such a situation\nwhere Adam retains one of Babe's cheating state sets which constitute a nonzero fraction\n\u03b3 of the total number n, the probability that Babe's cheating would not be found out is\np1\u03b3n\u22121 , assuming Adam indeed sets aside one of the cheating state sets, which goes to zero\nexponentially. This argument is essentially correct and will be presented rigorously in the\nmore general situation of the protocol in the following. Here we tried to indicate the simple\n23\n\n\fintuitive picture of the situation, and the fact that our scheme so far already contradicts\nthe (IP) statement, although it falls short of the (US) statement. It should be evident that\nregardless of whether (US) can be obtained in this kind of schemes, the are not covered by\nthe formulation of the impossibility proof.\nWere Babe found to be cheating, the protocol would of course abort, which is equivalent to\none party aborting in the middle of any protocol, something each party can always choose to\ndo. Thus, our scheme is no different in this respect from any other cryptographic protocol and\nis essentially different from the cheat-sensitive QBC protocols [10] in that it has nothing to\ndo with detecting possible cheating by Adam and Babe after Adam commits as prescribed in\nthe definition of cheat-sensitive protocols. Indeed, Adam can discover the cheating before he\ncommits the bit. Even though he could postpone the cheating detection measurement in our\nprotocol, such a move would have betrayed his bit to Babe, cf. point (4) in Section IV. More\nsignificantly, the cheating probabilities were not quantified precisely in Ref. [10] \u2013 presumably\nif the successful cheating probability is bounded away from zero, then so is the cheat-detection\nprobability. In the present case, arbitrarily small successful cheating probabilities can be\nobtained in the next protocol, the parameters n, m of which are determined as shown in the\nfollowing security proof.\nPROTOCOL QBC2:\n(i) Babe sends Adam n sets of qubit states, each set a random permutation of the four\nBB84 states on four different qubits, in a random order only known to herself. The states\nare named by their order in the sequence.\n(ii) Adam randomly puts m sets of such states aside and asks Babe to identify the rest\nof the states from their names. After checking that the states are correct, he commits the\nbit by picking one state randomly out of each of the m sets, modulates them by the same\nUb , and sends them to Babe.\n(iii) Adam opens by revealing the names of the states he sent and the bit value. Babe\nverifies by measuring the corresponding projections.\nIt should be clear that no entanglement cheating would be effective in this protocol: as\ndiscussed above, entanglement cheating by Adam or Babe serves no purpose as the qubits are\nprocessed individually. For each bit value Adam commits, there is only one product marginal\n24\n\n\fstate for Babe and thus no cheating transformation for Adam. If Adam entangles anyway, he\nwould merely send back mixed marginal states to Babe as she verifies on individual qubits.\nIf he does not commit a correct state as discussed after (23) in Section V, it merely changes\npA , the optimum value of which is not 1 as shown above. If Babe entangles anyway, she\nwould just get back mixed states for herself. Consequence of such a situation, however, is\nalso covered in the following. Similarly, introducing any classical correlation would serve no\npurpose. The protocol is binding because Adam's P\u0304cA = pm\nA \u2192 0 for large m. It is concealing\nbasically for the same reason as the single-qubit case, a systematic proof given as follows.\nLet N be the number of state sets Babe sends to Adam with probabilities p1 of passing\nAdam's detection, p1 < 1 with corresponding p2 > 21 . Consider first the case in which these\nprobabilities are uniform among the N sets so that Babe can have the best possible p2 given\np1 among the m different committed qubits. The other n \u2212 N sets have p1 = 1 and p2 = 21 .\nThe probability that k of these N sets fall into the m choices by Adam is given by the\nhypergeometric distribution,\nN\nk\n\nPk (N, n, m) =\n\n!\n\nn\u2212N\nm\u2212k\n\nn\nm\n\n!\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nThe probability that none of these N sets fall into the chosen m group is P0 (N, n, m), a\ndecreasing function of N and an increasing function of n. Let m be the smallest integer that\nyields P\u0304cA = pm\nA \u2264 \u01eb for given \u01eb > 0. The idea is that N must be large enough that at least\none of the N sets needs to fall into the m group to get P\u0304cB > 12 , but then by making n large,\nN would have to be so large that the probability Pu that Babe's cheating sets are undetected\nbecomes too small. Recall that P\u0304cB is the optimal probability Babe succeeds in identifying\nthe bit from measurements on m committed qubits. It will be shown that the condition\nP\u0304cB \u2265\n\n1\n+\u01eb\n2\n\n(36)\n\nwould imply Pu \u2264 \u01eb by proper choice of n, thus ensuring unconditional security. Since Babe\nmust have at least one of the N sets picked up by Adam among his m sets in order to satisfy\n(36),\nP0\n1\nP\u0304cB \u2264 P0 + (1 \u2212 P0 )P (p2, m) \u2264 1 \u2212 .\n2\n2\n25\n\n(37)\n\n\fBy equating the upper and lower bounds (36) and (37) on P\u0304cB , N must satisfy\nN \u2265 f (\u01eb, n, m(\u01eb, pA ))\n\n(38)\n\nwhere f is defined through P0 (N, n, m) and is an increasing function of n. For any N, n,\n\nP0 (N, n, m) =\n\nn\u2212m\nN\nn\nN\n\n!\n\n!\n\ncan be made arbitrarily small with n large. Thus, N can be forced to be arbitrarily small\nfrom (38) with n sufficiently large. If there is an a priori maximum p\u03041 among the qubits\nin the N sets, which is proved in the following, one would have Pu \u2264 p\u03041N \u2212m . So n can be\n\nchosen to make N large enough from (38) to yield p\u03041N \u2212m = \u01eb. As a consequence, P\u0304cA \u2264 \u01eb and\nP\u0304cB \u2264 \u01eb, proving (US).\n\nTo put an a priori limit on p1 independent of n and less than one, consider first the\ncase where all qubits in the N sets have the same underlying S \u2032 so that Babe knows what\nmeasurement to make on each. Let P (S \u2032, m) be the optimum probability that Babe succeeds\nin identifying b from measurements on the m qubit sets. Thus, P (S \u2032, m) is a continuous\nfunction of the S \u2032 that gives rise to the p2 as it is a trace norm of the states from (A4). (All\nnorm topologies are equivalent in finite-dimensional spaces). In order for (36) to be satisfied,\none must have\nP (S \u2032 , m) \u2265\n\n1\n+\u01eb\n2\n\n(39)\n\nfor some \u01eb > 0. The maximum p1 that Babe can have is determined among all the qubit\nsets S \u2032 that satisfy (39) and 1 \u2265 P (S \u2032 , m). The maximum p\u03041 = maxS \u2032\u2032 p1 (S \u2032\u2032 ) exists for\nthe following reason. Thus the set of S \u2032 obeying (39) and P (S \u2032, m) \u2264 1 is closed and thus\ncompact. The function p1 (S \u2032 ) of (34) is continuous. The existence of p\u03041 thus follows from\nthe Weierstrass theorem. That is, a maximum p\u03041 is achieved by some S0\u2032 in the constraint\nset and so p\u03041 < 1. Now suppose Babe has formed entanglements among the sets she sends\nto Adam. The N sets are defined according to whether each marginal state, as checked and\nmodulated by Adam, would have pj1 = 1, j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Thus, instead of P (S \u2032, m) one has\nP (S\u2032 , m) that includes optimization over all possible entangled states S\u2032 , which provides an\n26\n\n\fupper bound to P\u0304cB and is still given through the trace norm (A4). Let p\u03041 = maxSj p1 (Sj\u2032 )\nfor all marginal Sj\u2032 obtained from S\u2032 that satisfy 1 \u2265 P (S\u2032 , m) \u2265\nlead to pj2 <\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n+ \u01eb. All Sj\u2032 in the N-set\n\nby definition of the N-set. Thus, the existence of p\u03041 < 1 follows as in the\n\nuniform Sj\u2032 case. We have now exhausted all possible actions by Adam and Babe.\nIn order to execute this protocol in accordance with the above proof in choosing m and\nn, one needs to know pA and p\u03041 . These appear to be difficult to obtain analytically, and\nnumerical solutions would need to be used in an actual implementation. In such a situation,\nthe above technicality on the existence of p\u03041 < 1 would not occur. While it is easily shown\nthat no four large-energy coherent states can approximate the behavior of the four BB84\nstates in S0 , it may still be possible to develop large-energy coherent-state implementation\nof this protocol because not all properties of the BB84 states are needed.\n\n27\n\n\fVII\n\nProtocol QBC3\n\nThe points (7)-(8) in Section IV are now exploited to create a protocol that defeats Adam's\nEPR cheat. Consider the following addition to protocol QBC0 in Section II: after Adam\ncommits, Babe picks randomly N out of the n qubits and measures randomly on each either\n|\u03c6ih\u03c6| or |\u03c6\u2032ih\u03c6\u2032 |, but does not tell Adam which qubits she picked and what measurement\nresults she obtained. When Adam opens, she would verify among the N qubits those that\nmatch Adam's announcement and the rest n \u2212 N qubits, and take those that don't match\nAdam's announcement as correct. Thus, she does not have a perfect verification, but Adam\ncannot cheat successfully by changing one bit position in his announcement when N/n is\nsmall. On the other hand, this action by Babe effectively destroys the entanglement that\nAdam may have formed for the EPR cheat, as shown below. Babe needs to keep secret which\nN qubits she made measurements upon, or else Adam can alter his basis |ei i to entangle\nproperly to the other n \u2212 N qubits. Condition on the parameters will be given.\nPROTOCOL QBC3\n(i) Adam sends Babe a sequence of n qubits, each in either one of {|\u03c6i, |\u03c6\u2032i}, and commits\nb via the parity of the sequence with uniform probability.\n(ii) Babe randomly picks N out of n qubits, randomly measures either |\u03c6ih\u03c6| or |\u03c6\u2032 ih\u03c6\u2032|\non each, and keeps the results secret from Adam.\n(iii) After Adam reveals the sequence commitment, Babe verifies those states that match\namong the N measured qubits and the n \u2212 N unmeasured ones.\nThe protocol can be made concealing as in QBC0 and QBC1, but Adam can now cheat\nin more ways. Similar to QBC1, he can pick one qubit and announce it otherwise, which\nnow has a higher probability of success because of Babe's measurements. From the union\nbound on the probability of two possible events,\nN\n.\nn\n\n(40)\n\n|h\u03c6|\u03c6\u2032i|2 = O(m\u22121)\n\n(41)\n\nPcA \u2264 |h\u03c6|\u03c6\u2032i|2 +\nThus one may pick\n\n28\n\n\fsimilar to (23) and also\nN/n = O(m\u22121 ),\n\n(42)\n\nso that PcA = O(m\u22121 ). Adam can, in view of Babe's possible measurements, entangle as\nsmall a number of qubits as possible. If he wants an entanglement cheating probability of\nP\u0304cA = 1 \u2212 O(m\u22121 ),\nhe would need to entangle n\u2032 = O(m log m), so that the resulting P\u0304cB =\n\n(43)\n1\n2\n\n+ O(m\u22121 ) would\n\nguarantee (43) through (12). Thus, to maintain just this order of P\u0304cB , n should be reduced\nto n = O(m log m) compared to QBC1, and so N = O(log m) from (43).\nIf Adam just cheats as if Babe has made no measurement, a direct computation shows\nthat, for pi = p\u2032i = 1/M,\n|h\u03a6\u2032\u20320 |\u03a61 i|2 = 2\u2212N\n\n(44)\n\nwhere |\u03a6\u2032\u20320 i is the cheating entangled state from |\u03a60 i after Babe made her N qubit measurements as follows. The state |\u03a6\u2032\u20320 i can be written, from (5),\n|\u03a6\u2032\u20320 i =\n\ns\n\nN X X\nVi i ...i j |e\u2032 i|\u03c6iN iN+1 ...in\u22121 i\nM j iN+1 ...in\u22121 N N+1 n\u22121 j\n\n(45)\n\nwhere iN are the fixed indices corresponding to Babe's measurements results and N is a\nnormalization constant determined to be N = 2N . Then (44) follows from (45) and the\nunitarity of Vij . However, this does not yet constitute an unconditional security proof for\nthe following reasons. Adam does not have to apply the cheating transformation as if Babe\nhas made no measurements. It remains to be demonstrated that his optimal cheating transformation, particularly in the case he does not generate an exactly correct initial state for\nthe bit value as discussed after Eq. (23), would lead to an arbitrarily small PcA . Furthermore,\nAdam may aim lower than P\u0304cA = 1 \u2212 O(m\u22121 ) by optimizing differently, just to defeat (US).\nI believe QBC3 is in fact unconditionally secure, as I believe QBC1 is, and a new formulation of the QBC problem is being developed to facilitate further analysis of the PcA\nbehavior in QBC protocols with possible entanglement attacks. Such general treatment is\nimportant because the strategy of this protocol is applicable to all QBC protocols in which\nthe bit value is obtained from a correlated function of the individual bit positions, and the\nstrategy of QBC1, namely the use of anonymous states, is applicable to any QBC protocol.\n29\n\n\fVIII\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope this paper leaves no doubt that not only is there no general impossibility proof for\nunconditionally secure quantum bit commitment, but that, in fact, an unconditionally secure\nQBC protocol has actually been provided. The intuitive reasons and a complete proof that\nQBC2 satisfies (US) have been described in Section VI. The protocols QBC1 and QBC3,\nwhile not proved to be unconditionally secure in this paper, already demonstrate the failure\nof the impossibility proof given in the literature. Additional gaps of the impossibility proof\nare indicated in Section IV and can be exploited for further secure QBC schemes.\nSome comments on the practicality of our protocols are in order. Protocols QBC0,\nQBC1, and QBC3 can be readily implemented with large-energy coherent states. However,\nthere is a sensitivity problem that results from |h\u03c6|\u03c6\u2032i| \u223c 0, which obscures the difference\nin practice between the two cases of detection for verification versus cheating corresponding\nto the cases when the state is known or unknown. An investigation into sensitive detection\nschemes would be timely. Also, it is expected that this and other practical difficulties can\nbe alleviated by the use of error-correcting codes or hash functions more complicated than\nparity. Perhaps a large-energy coherent-state scheme similar to QBC2 can also be developed.\nAnother promising avenue is the utilization of the irreducible quantum noise in quantum\nsignal detection schemes to achieve unconditionally secure bit commitment. The loss in\nfiber-optic communications, especially for the established Internet backbone, can also be\nused to generate irreducible quantum noise. The resulting protocols, together with similarly\npossible quantum key distribution and encryption schemes, may open the exciting possibility\nof optical-speed unconditionally secure cryptography for widespread applications.\n\n30\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nI am indebted to many colleagues for their criticism, support, and discussions, especially to\nM. d'Ariano, C.

It has not been used in the previous quantum cryptography literature other\nthan my papers [12], [19], [32], [33], although it actually has a crucial role, especially in QBC.\nThus, Babe's optimum probability of cheating is given by the optimum binary quantum\nB\ndetector for \u03c1B\n0 and \u03c11 .\n\nIn binary quantum hypothesis testing with a priori probabilities p0 and p1 = 1 \u2212 p0 ,\nthe decision is made on the basis of measuring a POM (positive operator-valued measure)\ndescribed by \u03a00 and \u03a01 = I \u2212 \u03a00 , \u03a00 \u2265 0 (an operator inequality A \u2265 B means that A \u2212 B\nis positive semidefinite). The hypothesis i is chosen correctly from the measurement result\nwith probability tr\u03a0i \u03c1i , so that the total probability of correct decison is given by\nPC2 = p0 tr\u03a00 \u03c10 + p1 tr\u03a01 \u03c11 .\n\n(A1)\n\nIn M-ary hypothesis testing, (A1) generalizes to\nPCM =\n\nM\nX\n\npi tr\u03a0i \u03c1i\n\n(A2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the {\u03a0i } form the M-outcome POM\nM\nX\n\n\u03a0i = I,\n\ni=1\n\n\u03a0i \u2265 0.\n\n(A3)\n\n\u221a\nAn operator \u03c4 is called trace-class if its trace norm k\u03c4 k1 \u2261 tr \u03c4 \u2020 \u03c4 is defined (finite); thus\nall operators on finite-dimensional spaces are trace-class. Density operators are trace-class.\nThe optimum P\u0304C2 among all POM's can be written as follows.\nLemma A1:\nP\u0304C2 =\n\n1 1\n+ kp0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 k1 .\n2 2\n32\n\n(A4)\n\n\fProof: Write p0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 = \u03c3+ \u2212 \u03c3\u2212 , the positive and negative eigenvalue parts, so that\n|p0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 | \u2261\n\nq\n\n(p0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 )2 = \u03c3+ + \u03c3\u2212 . From tr(p0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 ) = p0 \u2212 p1 , one has\n\ntr\u03c3+ = tr\u03c3\u2212 + p0 \u2212 p1 . Now, from (A1),\nP\u0304C2 = p1 + max tr\u03a0(p0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 ),\n0\u2264\u03a0\u2264I\n\nwhile\nmax tr\u03a0(p0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 ) =\n\n0\u2264\u03a0\u2264I\n\n1\n1\ntr\u03a0\u03c3+ = tr\u03c3+ = kp0 \u03c10 \u2212 p1 \u03c11 k1 + (p0 \u2212 p1 ),\n0\u2264\u03a0\u2264I, \u03a0\u03c3\u2212 =0\n2\n2\nmax\n\nand (A4) follows. \u2737\nFor two pure states, |\u03c80 i and |\u03c81 i, (A4) reduces to\nPC2 =\n\n1 1q\n+\n1 \u2212 4p0 p1 |h\u03c80 |\u03c81 i|2 .\n2 2\n\n(A5)\n\nThe use of \"information\" e.g. as in Ref. [34], is not sufficient in QBC because it is not the\nrelevant performance measure, and the optimum detectors for P\u0304cB and mutual information\nare usually not the same. Indeed, generally in cryptography, the use of mutual information\nis often not sufficiently precise because it has only asymptotic significance in a noisy system,\nand at least Eve has no possibility of coding. Thus, the performance resulting from attacks by\nEve or by cheating among users in QBC should be measured by their respective probabilities\nof success. In some cases, including many quantum key-distribution situations, the mutual\ninformation could be used to bound the successful eavesdropping probability. But even in\nthose situations the resulting system design may be overly pessimistic when the mutual\ninformation criterion is employed.\nAn important condition whose validity seems clear intuitively is that P\u0304C2 = 1 in binary\nquantum detection if and only if the states satisfy \u03c10 \u03c11 = 0, i.e. the ranges of \u03c10 and \u03c11 are\northogonal subspaces of the state Hilbert space. The \"if\" part is immediate and the \"only if\"\npart, which follows from (A5) when \u03c10 and \u03c11 are pure states, seems to be a consequence of the\ngeneral no-clone theorem. Specifically, one would be able to clone two nonorthogonal states\nif one could discriminate between them perfectly. However, the unitarity argument used for\nno-cloning is not sufficient to include measurement transformations \u2013 at least many physicists\n33\n\n\fbelieve that a quantum measurement transformation with a specific reading is not describable\nby a unitary transformation on any larger Hilbert space. Nor is linearity sufficient. Thus, the\nimpossibility of perfectly discriminating nonorthogonal pure states, expressed as \u03c10 \u03c11 6= 0\nfor general mixed states, is a separate property to be demonstrated, indeed even just for\ncompleting the no-clone argument. That such a property can be demonstrated from quantum\ndetection theory, as done below, appears to me to be another manifestation of the \"magical\nunity\" or consistency of the quantum formalism.\nThe proof of the following theorem generalizes a finite-dimensional proof for the case\n\u03bb0 = \u03bb1 = 1 first communicated to the author by Masanao Ozawa.\nTheorem A1: For positive constants \u03bb0 , \u03bb1 and density operators \u03c10 , \u03c11 , the maximum value\nof k\u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03c11 k1 amoung all possible \u03c10 , \u03c11 occurs only when \u03c10 \u03c11 = 0, with\nk\u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03c11 k1 = \u03bb0 + \u03bb1 .\n\n(A6)\n\nProof: In the finite-dimensional case, the polar decomposition of\n\u03c1\u2032 \u2261 \u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03c11 = U|\u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03c11 |\n\n(A7)\n\nalways exists for a unitary U. In the infinite-dimensional case, U is only a partial isometry in\ngeneral [35]. Since \u03c1\u2032 on H has an eigenvector decomposition as it is trace-class, U becomes\nan isometry when restricted to the space Hr \u2282 H, the range of \u03c1\u2032 . Thus, U \u2020 U = IHr , and\nwe can write\n|\u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03c11 | = V (\u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03c11 )\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere V = U \u2020 , kV k = 1. From (A8),\nk\u03c1\u2032 k1 = trV (\u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03c11 ) = trV \u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2212 trV \u03bb1 \u03c11 .\n\n(A9)\n\nNow, from (18), for any trace-class operator A \u2265 0 and any V with kV k = 1, the real part\nRe tr(V A) \u2264 |tr(V A)| \u2264 kV Ak1 \u2264 kV kkAk1 = Re trA,\nleading to\nRe tr(V A) \u2264 Re trA\n34\n\n(A10)\n\n\ffrom which it follows that\n\u2212 \u03bb0 \u2264 Re trV \u03bb0 \u03c10 \u2264 \u03bb0 ,\n\n\u2212\u03bb1 \u2264 \u2212trU\u03bb1 \u03c11 \u2264 \u03bb1 .\n\n(A11)\n\nFrom (A9) and (A11), we have\nmax k\u03c1\u2032 k1 = \u03bb0 + \u03bb1\n\u03c10 ,\u03c11\n\n(A12)\n\nwhich occurs when\nRe trV \u03c10 = 1\n\nLet \u03c10 have the spectral decomposition \u03c10 =\nX\nn\n\nSince 0 \u2264 \u03bdn \u2264 1 and\n\nP\n\nn\n\nRe trV \u03c11 = \u22121.\n\nand\nP\n\nn\n\n(A13)\n\n\u03bdn |\u03c6n ih\u03c6n |. Then (A13) implies\n\n\u03bdn h\u03c6n |V |\u03c6n i = 1.\n\n\u03bdn = 1, if \u03bdn 6= 0 we have Reh\u03c6n |V |\u03c6n i = 1 and hence V |\u03c6n i = |\u03c6n i.\n\nLet \u03c11 have the spectral decomposition \u03c11 =\n\nP\n\nm\n\n\u03bcm |\u03c8m ih\u03c8m |. Similarly, if \u03bcm 6= 0, then\n\nV |\u03c8m i = \u2212|\u03c8m i. Since V V \u2020 = IHr , the eigenvectors of V with different eigenvalues are\nmutually orthogonal and hence\n\u03c10 \u03c11 =\n\nX\n\nm,n\n\n\u03bdn \u03bcm |\u03c6n ih\u03c6n |\u03c8m ih\u03c8m | = 0.\n\n(A14)\n\n\u2737\nCorollary A1: PC2 = 1 if and only if \u03c10 \u03c11 = 0.\nI would like to emphasize that by itself, without the need for unitarity, Corollary A1\nalready implies the no-clone theorem for arbitrary \u03c10 \u03c11 6= 0. This is because if one can\nclone, one can obtain an indefinitely large number of copies of the state, which would make\nit possible to determine the state arbitrarily accurately and hence contradicting the corollary. On the other hand, an argument using the physical interpretation of density operator\nas an ensemble would show, in conjunction with the pure-state result from (A5), that the\neigenstates of \u03c10 and \u03c11 must be mutually orthogonal to ensure P\u0304C2 = 0, thus proving the\ncorollary without Theorem A1. While this can be considered a new kind of mathematics,\nproving mathematical theorems from physical arguments, it is appropriate to separate physical interpretation from what the mathematical formalism says by itself, if only to check\nwhether they are compatible.\n35\n\n\fThe above theorem can be generalized to M-ary hypothesis testing.\nTheorem A2: PCM = 1 if and only if \u03c1i \u03c1j = 0 for all i 6= j.\nProof: If one pair is not orthogonal, say \u03c11 \u03c12 6= 0, then\nPCM = p1 tr\u03a01 \u03c11 + p2 tr\u03a02 \u03c12 +\n\nM\nX\ni=3\n\npi tr\u03a0i \u03c1i \u2264 p1 tr\u03a0\u03c11 + p2 tr\u03a02 \u03c12 + 1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2\n\nsince (A3) implies k\u03a0i k \u2264 1 so that tr\u03a0i \u03c1i \u2264 1 from (18) and (A3). Because the maximum\nover \u03a00 of the expression (A1) is given by (A4) for any positive p0 , p1 , as can be seen from\nthe proof of Lemma A1, it follows from Theorem A1 that p1 tr\u03a01 \u03c11 + p2 tr\u03a02 \u03c12 = 1 if and\nonly if \u03c11 \u03c12 = 0. Thus PCM < 1. The contraposition of this conclusion is the nontrivial part\nof the theorem. \u2737\n\n36\n\n\fAppendix B\nLocal State Invariance\nThe local state invariance theorem is conceptually significant and has a simple proof.\nTheorem (Local State Invariance): Let \u03c1AB be a state on HA \u2297 HB with marginal states\n\u03c1A \u2261 trB \u03c1AB , \u03c1B . The individual or combined effects of any state transformation and quantum measurement (averaged over the measurement results) on HA alone leaves \u03c1B invariant.\nProof: It suffices to consider a pure state |\u03a6i \u2208 HA \u2297HB in Schmidt form |\u03a6i =\nhek |ek\u2032 i = h\u03c6k |\u03c6k\u2032 i = \u03b4kk\u2032 so that \u03c1B =\n\nP\n\nk\n\nP\n\nk\n\n\u03b1k |ek i|\u03c6k i,\n\n|\u03b1k |2 |\u03c6k ih\u03c6k |. The most general operation on HA\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ncan be represented by extending HA to HA \u2297 HA with initial state |A\u2032 i \u2208 HA , and apply\u2032\n\ning a unitary U and measuring a complete orthonormal basis {|nihn|} on HA \u2297 HA [36].\nThis results in \u03c1\u0303B =\n\nP\n\nn\n\n|nihn|U|\u03a6i|A\u2032 ihA\u2032 |h\u03a6|U \u2020 |nihn| so that h\u03c6k |\u03c1\u0303B |\u03c6k\u2032 i = |\u03b1k |2 \u03b4kk\u2032 =\n\nh\u03c6k |\u03c1B |\u03c6k\u2032 i. The same result obtains when either U or the measurement on {|nihn|} is omitted. \u2737\nThe Schmidt decomposition in the above proof only simplifies notation and is not essential.\nThis theorem implies that superluminal communication via quantum entanglement is impossible, which would be obtained if and only if \u03c1B is changed so that a binary communication\nchannel of classical information with nonzero channel capacity is created. Observe that the\naveraging over measurement results in the theorem is a crucial condition for application to\nsuperluminal communication in which the specific measurement result on HA is unknown\nto the party with HB . While there are many proofs on the impossibility of entanglement\ninduced superluminal communication in the literature, see, e.g., [37], none appears to be as\ncomplete and simple as the proof just given. In particular, the impossibility of cloning quantum states in some such proofs is not sufficient to establish the impossibility of superluminal\ncommunication.\n\n37\n\n\fAppendix C\nEven and Odd Binomial Sums\nThe even and odd binomial sums used in obtaining (15) are derived as follows.

As discussed in Appendix A, mutual information is not the appropriate criterion,\nbut its optimizing measurement also does not factorize in this case anyway. Another\nproblem is that there is no known polynomial time algorithm for the NP-hard problem\nof determining the minimum distance of a randomly chosen binary linear code, even\nprobabilistically or approximately, which would be needed to execute the protocol and\nto prevent cheating.\n[35] P.R. Halmos, A Hilbert Space Problem Book, Springer-Verlag, 1982, ch. 15-16.\n[36] This is clearly all one can do according to the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. When restricted to HA , this gives rise to CP map \"superoperator\" and POM\n\"generalized\" measurement, which indeed characterize all possible state transformations\nand measurements because they can be so represented in an extended space as shown\nby M.
