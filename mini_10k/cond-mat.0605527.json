Since we are dealing with field-distributions\nthis means that the fields will be narrowly distributed\naround zero so that we can expand the equations (35)\nand (37), using equation (30). In order to quantify\nthe\ndifference with the deltapeak-solution\nwe assume\nR\nR\ndh hk \u03c6(h) = O(\u01ebk ) and dh hk \u03c7(h) = O(\u01ebk ) with\n|\u01eb| \u226a 1 such that\nZ\nZ\nm = \u03b2 dx \u03c6(x)x + \u03b2 dy \u03c7(y)y + O(\u01eb3 ) (39)\nZ\nq = \u03b2 2 dx dy \u03c6(x)\u03c7(y)(x + y)2 + O(\u01eb3 ) (40)\nIn order to find the transition towards non-zero magnetization we look for bifurcations where the\nR first moments\nbecome\nR of order \u01eb.

This model gets a mean-field character and can be solved analytically by using the transfermatrix approach. In the sequel we denote this model by\nthe 1 + \u221e dimensional model.\nIn order to have a multispin interaction between every\nmultiplet of p spins we must take c = N p\u22121 /(p \u2212 1)!

It is easy to see that m = 0,\nwhich describes the paramagnetic phase, always satisfies\nEq. (53) for any temperature. To find phase transitions\naway from the paramagnetic solution, we must find the\ncritical parameter values for which the pair of equations\nm = G(m) and 1 = G\u2032 (m) has new m 6= 0 solutions.\nThese solutions can be created from m = 0 (continuous\nbifurcation) or away from m = 0 (discontinuous ones).\nWith these considerations we immediately observe that\nthere are no solutions for p > 2, but for p = 2 we find the\nsolution\n\u03b2J = e\u22122\u03b2J0\n\n(54)\n\n(48)\n(49)\n\nTo look for first-order transitions we have to find solutions\nto m = G(m) and 1 = G\u2032 (m) at m 6= 0.

The value\nof the magnetization m at that point is given by equation\n(55). These phase transition lines are plotted in Fig. 2\nfor several values of the degree p.\n\nWe see that no transitions occur for even p and \u03b2J < 0.\nFurthermore, we remark the \u03b2J symmetry for odd p, due\nto the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian (5) and\n(6) under the change of sign \u03c3 \u2192 \u2212\u03c3. The ferromagnetic phase is situated to the right of the transition lines,\nso for odd p the paramagnetic phase is in between the\nsymmetrical solid lines, for p even it lies below the corresponding solid line. For increasing p, the ferromagnetic\nregion decreases. For the special case of p = 2 the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phase coexist between the first\nand second-order\ntransition lines with as tri-critical point\n\u221a\n\u03b2J = 3 \u2248 1.732, \u03b2J0 = \u2212 log(3)/4 \u2248 \u22120.275. The latter results are in agreement with the results of [20] and\nwith those of [21] in the case of one dimension. This analysis serves as a limiting case of our small-world model for\nincreasingly larger values of the mean connectivity per\nsite c.\n\n\f8\nenergy of both the m = 0 and m 6= 0 solutions. The\nformer is given by (38), and the latter can be calculated\nnumerically from (33). This leads to two special temperatures: the temperature where the first m 6= 0 solutions\nstart to appear, also known as the spinodal point, dynamical transition or metastable transition, and the temperature where the ferromagnetic free energy becomes lower\nthan the paramagnetic free energy, indicating the thermodynamic phase transition.\n\n6\n4\n2\n\n\u03b2J 0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u03b2 J0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 2: Phase diagram for the 1 + \u221e dimensional model in\nthe \u03b2J \u2212 \u03b2J0 plane for different p.

(28), (29)\nand (30). To solve these equations we use the population dynamics algorithm to generate field distributions\ntogether with Monte Carlo integration over the generated populations in order to obtain the physical parameters. The important parameters of this algorithm are\nthe size of the populations and the number of iterations.\nThe size of the populations has to be big enough to get\nclearly outlined distributions keeping in mind, however,\nthat the computational time required for the algorithm\nto converge is linear in this parameter. In most cases we\nfind that populations of 10000 fields give accurate results.\nThe number of iterations per spin depends strongly on the\nphysical parameters. It turns out that most of the time\nabout 1000 iterations results in a reasonable accuracy. To\ncalculate the ferromagnetic free energy it proves useful to\naverage over several (e.g. 100) runs with different initial\nconditions.\nFrom the 1 + \u221e dimensional model solved analytically\nin Section IV we learned already that the physics for p =\n2 versus the one for p \u2265 3 might be very different. As a\nbenchmark test for our derivations we have reproduced\nsome of the results for p = 2 found in [7, 21]. We do not\nrepeat them here but concentrate on p \u2265 3 in the sequel.\nStarting from the paramagnetic phase and lowering the\ntemperature, ferromagnetic solutions will start to appear,\nindicating a dynamical transition which appears to be\nfirst order. However, to check which of these solutions is\nthermodynamically stable, we need to calculate the free\n\nTfm\n\n-0.4\n0.2\n\nTms\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nT\n\nFIG. 3: The free energy per spin as a function of temperature for J = 1, J0 = 0, c = 3 and p = 3. The dashed\nline indicates the free energy of the m 6= 0 state, while the\nsolid line indicates the paramagnetic free energy. The thermodynamic phase transition occurs at the crossing of the two\nlines, whereas the spinodal point is the highest temperature\nfor which an m 6= 0 solution is possible.\n\nFirst, we calculate for general p the critical temperatures at which these transitions occur. They are plotted\nfor the the cases p = 3, 4 for the model without chain contribution (J0 = 0) in Fig. 4 , and with chain contribution\n(J0 = 0.1) in Fig. 5. Above the thermodynamic transition lines (Tf m ) we find the paramagnetic phase, below the ferromagnetic phase. Metastable ferromagnetic\nstates can be found up until the corresponding spinodal\nlines (Tms ). For all J0 we see that the critical temperature decreases with increasing p. For J0 = 0 a higher c\nis required to have ferromagnetic behavior. For numerical reasons we do not consider very small T or c. The\nresults for p = 3 and J0 = 0 are in agreement with the\nTf m and Tms transition lines given in [15] (note that our\nHamiltonian is rescaled with a factor c).\n\n\f9\n0.5\n\n6\n0.4\n\nT ms\nT fm\n\n0.3\n\n4\n\n\u03b2J\n\nT\nT fm\n\nT ms\n\n0.2\n\n2\n0.1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\nc\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 4: Critical temperatures as a function of the average\nconnectivity c for the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition (Tf m ) and the spinodal line (Tms ).

For bigger\nvalues of c, the transitions approach the analytically derived c = \u221e result. Because p is odd, the transition\nlines for \u03b2J < 0 are found by reflection symmetry with\nrespect to the \u03b2J0 axis. Just as in the p = 2 case, the\nsmall-world hypergraph has its ferromagnetic transition\nat finite temperatures for all non-zero values of c. Analogously to the 1 + \u221e dimensional case (see fig. 2), the\nferromagnetic region decreases with increasing p, and disappears for p \u2192 \u221e.\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0\n-2\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 5: Critical temperatures as a function of the average\nconnectivity c for the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition (Tf m ) and the spinodal line (Tms ). Parameters are:\np = 3, J0 = 0.1 (solid); p = 4, J0 = 0.1 (dotted); For all lines\nJ = 1.\n\nFurthermore, we search for the transition lines in the\n\u03b2J \u2212 \u03b2J0 plane. These transitions between m 6= 0\nand m = 0 are plotted in Fig. 6 for p = 3, \u03b2J > 0\nand c = 1, 3, 10 (solid lines), together with the spinodal\nlines (dotted lines) and the theoretical result for c \u2192 \u221e\n(dashed line), which is solved analytically in Section IV.\nAll transitions shown here are first-order. The ferromag-\n\nSimulations have been performed for this small-world\nmodel with heat-bath dynamics and sequential updating. Our results in this perspective are somewhat limited\nby the nature of the phase transition: We are dealing\nwith a very sparse system undergoing a first-order phase\ntransition. Metastabilities will be present (as already indicated by the presence of the spinodal lines) and cause\nslow dynamics near the thermodynamic transition line.\nThis in turn causes the system to show strong hysteresis effects. With these simulations we can look for the\nspinodal line by initializing the system in a fully magnetized state, and looking for the temperature where order\ndisappears at long times. As a typical example the results for p = 3, c = 3 are plotted in Fig. 7 for 104 spins\nand different numbers of iterations. Very good agreement with the spinodal line obtained with the population\ndynamics solution is found in the positive \u03b2J0 region.\nWhen J0 is negative however we do not find satisfactory\nresults. This can be explained by the opposing forces\nat work in the system (ferromagnetic graph and antiferromagnetic chain), which will only slow the dynamics\nfurther down. We were unable to pinpoint the thermo-\n\n\f10\ndynamic phase transitions with simulations due to the\neffects mentioned above. The simulations show some further evidence for glassy dynamics (very large spin-spin\nautocorrelation times) for lower temperatures, but a detailed discussion of such non-trivial glassy behavior is beyond the scope of the present work.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the thermodynamics of\nsmall-world hypergraphs consisting of sparse Poisson random graphs with p-spin interactions superimposed onto a\none-dimensional Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions. Using a replica-symmetric transfer-matrix analysis and the population dynamics algorithm we have obtained the phase behavior of this system as a function\nof the short-range and long-range couplings. We find for\np \u2265 3 that all paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transitions are purely first order, in contrast with p = 2 where\nalso a second order phase transition occurs. For fixed p\nand increasing connectivity c the ferromagnetic phase increases substantially and the transition line converges to\nthe analytically derived result for the 1 + \u221e dimensional\nmodel. For the latter the ferromagnetic region decreases\nfor growing p. Using a bifurcation analysis we see that\nagain, p = 2 has also a second-order transition and the\nfirst-order transition occurs only for \u03b2J0 \u2264 \u22120.275.\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n\u03b2J\n4\n\n2\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03b2 J0\n\nWe would like to thank Heinz Horner for interesting\ndiscussions.
