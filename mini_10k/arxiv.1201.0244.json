Obuse et al.,2,3 studied the metal-ordinary insulator\ntransition in quantum spin Hall (QSH) systems and found that the value of the critical exponent is the same as\nthat of topologically trivial symplectic systems. However, Obuse et al. only studied transitions to insulating phases\nwithout edge states leaving open the possibility that the critical exponent for the metal-QSH insulator transition\nmight be different. Indeed, the critical conductance distributions have been found to be sensitive to the number of\nthe edge states.4\nHere, we report an estimation of the critical exponent for the divergence of the localization length at the metal-QSH\ninsulator transition. We find a value of the critical exponent that is consistent with that in the conventional symplectic\nclass. Our result supports the conjecture that the metal-QSH insulator transition belongs to the conventional WignerDyson symplectic class.\nA.\n\nSecond smallest positive Lyapunov exponent\n\nIn order to estimate the critical exponents for the divergence of the localization length, we have performed a finite size\nscaling analysis of numerical data for Lyapunov exponents.5\u20138 This involves the estimation of the Lyapunov exponents\nfor quasi-one-dimensional systems with effectively infinite length and given cross sections. For extrapolation to the\ntwo dimensional limit that is of interest here, a strip with a cross section L is considered. For ordinary metal-insulator\ntransitions, the standard approach is to analyze the scaling of the dimensionless quantity\n\u0393 = \u03931 = \u03b31 L,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is equal to the product of the smallest positive Lyapunov exponent \u03b31 (precisely defined below) and the cross\nsection. (This quantity is the inverse of the so-called MacKinnon-Kramer parameter.) In a metallic phase \u0393 usually\nincrease with L and in a localized phase usually decreases with L. At the transition point between these phases \u0393\nbecomes independent of L and a common crossing point of curves with different L is visible on the appropriate graph.\nHowever, when applying this method to the metal-QSH insulator transition we run into a problem: \u0393 increases in\nboth the metallic and QSH insulating phases and no common crossing point is seen (Fig. 2). This problem, which\nmakes a very precise scaling analysis difficult, occurs because of the existence of edge states in the QSH insulating\nphase. We have overcome this problem by analyzing the scaling of the quantity\n\u03932 = \u03b32 L,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich involves the second smallest positive Lyapunov exponent. This Lyapunov exponent is much less affected by\nthese edge states and a common crossing point is recovered (Fig. 3). It has been demonstrated9 for the Anderson\n\n\fCritical exponent for the quantum spin Hall transition in Z2 network model\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Phase diagram of Z2 network model with (a) PBC and (b) RBC. When RBC are imposed, the insulating phase\nwithout edge states appears for small p, the quantum spin Hall insulating phase appears for large p, and a metallic phase\nappears between the two insulating phases. The arrow indicates the range of the parameter considered in this paper.\n\ntransition in three dimensional systems in the orthogonal symmetry class that the critical exponent obtained from the\nscaling of higher Lyapunov exponents is the same as that obtained from the scaling of the smallest positive exponent.\nII.\n\nCALCULATION OF LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS\nA.\n\nModel\n\nTo describe the QSH system, we use a Z2 quantum network model.10\u201312 The Z2 network model has two controlling\nparameters, p, the tunneling probability (related to the chemical potential), and q, the spin-mixing probability (related\nto the spin-orbit interaction strength). For finite q, the Z2 network model exhibits a metallic phase sandwiched between\ntwo insulating phases. When periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are imposed, both insulating phases correspond to\nthe ordinary insulating phase [Fig. 1(a)]. On the other hand, when reflecting boundary conditions (RBC) are imposed,\nthe insulating phase located for larger p exhibits edge states and becomes the QSH insulating phase [Fig. 1(b)]. Thus,\nthe Z2 network model with RBC shows two types of transition: the metal-ordinary insulator transition and the\nmetal-QSH insulator transition.1\nThe cross section of the network is measured in terms of the number of links; a slice of width L contains L links,\nand each link has a spin degree of freedom. In this paper we focus on the case of L even with RBC. (For L odd,\nperfectly conducting channels appear.13,14 )\nB.\n\nLyapunov exponents\n\nWe consider a quasi-one-dimensional system. The Lyapunov exponents are estimated using a transfer matrix\nmethod. The transfer matrix Tx relates the current amplitudes \u03c8x on the slice x to those on the next slice,\n\u03c8x+1 = Tx \u03c8x .\n\n(3)\n\nConsider the matrix T \u2020 T , where T is the transfer matrix product,\nT = TM * * * T2 T1 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe matrix T \u2020 T is Hermitian and positive definite (because T is invertible) and so its eigenvalues are real and positive.\nThey also occur in reciprocal pairs because of current conservation. From each eigenvalue a Lyapunov exponent is\n\n1\n\nThe direct transition from the ordinary to QSH insulator occurs only for q \u2192 0. In this limit, the transition point belongs to the same\nuniversality class as the integer quantum Hall system.\n\n\fCritical exponent for the quantum spin Hall transition in Z2 network model\n\n3\n\ndefined by the limit\nln \u03bb\n,\nM\u2192\u221e 2M\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b3 = lim\n\nwhere \u03bb is an eigenvalue of T \u2020 T . In QSH systems, states are doubly degenerate (Kramers degeneracy) and the same\ndegeneracy occurs in the Lyapunov exponents. Keeping this in mind, and putting the exponents in decreasing order,\nwe number them as\n\u03b3L/2 > \u03b3L/2\u22121 > * * * > \u03b32 > \u03b31 > 0 > \u2212\u03b31 > \u2212\u03b32 > * * * > \u2212\u03b3L/2 .\n\n(6)\n\nHere, it is to be understood that each exponent is doubly degenerate.\nThe calculation of the Lyapunov exponent Eq. (5) is terminated at finite M when the target Lyapunov exponent\nhas converged to within a specified precision. Note that higher Lyapunov exponents converge more quickly than lower\nLyapunov exponents.\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFinite size scaling\n\nWe consider a Z2 network model with strip geometry with RBC in transverse direction and the spin-mixing parameter set to q = 0.309. For each \u0393, we assume the scaling formula,\n\u0393(L, p) = F ((p \u2212 pc )L1/\u03bd , (p \u2212 pc )Lyirr ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere yirr (< 0) is the exponent for the irrelevant correction to scaling. We expand the scaling function around the\nQSH transition point p = pc as\n\u0393(L, p) = \u0393c +\n\nnc\nX\nj=1\n\nm nX\nd (i)\n\u0011j\n\u0010\n\u0011j X\n\u0010\ni\ndj (i) uL1/\u03bd (vLyirr ) ,\ncj uL1/\u03bd +\n\n(8)\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nwhere u is the relevant scaling variable,\nu=\n\nna\nX\n\nnb\nX\n\naj\n\n\u0012\n\np \u2212 pc\npc\n\n\u0013j\n\n,\n\na1 = 1,\n\n(9)\n\nbj\n\n\u0012\n\np \u2212 pc\npc\n\n\u0013j\n\n,\n\nb0 = 1.\n\n(10)\n\nj=1\n\nand v the irrelevant scaling variable,\nv=\n\nj=0\n\nFirst, we analyze \u0393, which is calculated from the smallest positive Lyapunov exponent (see Fig. 2).

Nevertheless, the precision of the estimate of the critical\nexponent \u03bd is not sufficient to distinguish it from the critical exponent of the quantum Hall transition, \u03bd = 2.59\u00b10.01.15\nNext we analyze \u03932 , which is calculated from the 2nd smallest positive Lyapunov exponent (see Fig. 3). We see\na clear common crossing point of the curves separating the metallic and topological insulating phases. A fit of the\nnumerical data to Eq. (7) with na = 2, nb = 1, nc = 4, nd (1) = 4, nd (2) = 2 yielded\npc = 0.562\u00b10.001, \u0393c = 1.429\u00b10.004, \u03bd = 2.73\u00b10.02, yirr = \u22120.95\u00b10.02 .\n\n(12)\n\nThe precision of the data for the 2nd Lyapunov exponents is better than 0.01%, and goodness of fit is 0.7. This result\nis in good agreement with that obtained by Asada et al.16 for SU(2) model with PBC, \u03bd = 2.746 \u00b1 0.009, and by\nObuse et al.2 for Z2 network model with RBC at the metal-ordinary insulator transition, \u03bd = 2.88 \u00b1 0.04.

By analyzing the scaling of the 2nd smallest positive Lyapunov exponent, we\nhave estimated the critical exponent to be \u03bd = 2.73 \u00b1 0.02. Our result shows that this critical exponent is insensitive\nto the topological property of the insulating phase. This is in sharp contrast to the critical conductance distribution,4\nwhich is sensitive to the type of transition, i.e., the presence or absence of edge states in the adjacent insulating phase.\nAnalysis of the scaling of higher Lyapunov exponents may also be useful in the study of other Anderson transitions\nwhere conducting edge or surface states occur in the insulating phase, such as, for example, in topological insulators.\n\n\fCritical exponent for the quantum spin Hall transition in Z2 network model\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by KAKENHI No. 23*3743 and KAKENHI No. 23540376.\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\nElectronic address: k-koji@sophia.ac.jp\nM.
