Their apparatus, which is schematically drawn in Fig. 1, realizes a pure-carbon transistor.\nThe two CNT leads, biased by a potential Vsd , are the\nsource and the drain for the current flowing through the\nCNT-ring; the latter is sitting on a surface which fixes\nthe gate voltage to Vg . This system, which is the object\nof our theoretical investigation, exhibits an interesting\nvariety of effects mainly due to the ring topology and\nto the underlying carbon nanostructure. Our results are\nvalidated by the experiment of Watanabe et al.11 but\nshow interesting additional phenomena which should be\ndirectly detectable in future experiments.\nWe treat the transport problem in the system at hand\nby calculating the transmission t through an armchair\n(l, l) CNT ring within the Landauer approach.12 The relation between the Hamiltonian of the system and the\ntransmission13 is given by means of the retarded Green\n\u0001\u22121\nfunction Gring = E + i0+ \u2212 H ring\n, where H ring is the\nring \u03c0 electron Hamiltonian. Provided that the system\nhas atomic contacts, one can show that the calculus of\nthe transmission simplifies to\n2\n\ntn (E) = 4 \u220611 (E)\u2206nn (E) Gring\n1n (E) /det (Q) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a3 = \u039b \u2212 i\u2206 is the semi-infinite armchair (l, l)\nCNT lead self-energy, Q = I \u2212 \u03a3 Gring , and I is the\nunity matrix. Recently, both \u039b and \u2206 have been obtain\nanalytically.14 We assume that the fixed first lead has an\natomic contact to the first ring atom of the upmost circumference line spanned by the second lead. The position\nof the latter is determined by the second contacted atom\nn = 2, . . . , 2c (see Fig. 1). The total number of upmost\natoms, 2c, is two times the number of unit cells, c, due\nto the choice of the armchair tubes. We can span contacts (dashed area in Fig.1) ranging from a single atomic\ncontact to all surface atoms of the CNT leads contacted\nto the lead.14 For sake of simplicity we present here only\natomic contacts results. The numerical computational\ntask is thus shifted to the calculus of the matrix element\n\n\f2\n\n1\n\n3 eV\n2.5 eV\n0 eV\n\n0\n(a)\n\n-1\n1\n\nhI17=(e\u03b3)\n\nHere fL,R (E) = {exp[(E\u2212\u03bcL,R )/kB T ]+1}\u22121 is the Fermi\nfunction, \u03bcL and \u03bcR are the electrochemical potentials of\n\nFIG. 3: Density plot of the current (STM images) at Vsd =\n1 V as a function of the position n and of the gate voltage\nVg .

The latter is in units of the hopping parameter, \u03b3 = 2.6 eV, between neighboring carbon atoms.\nThe number of unit cells considered in the ring is c = 16\n(i.e., 32 upmost atoms) and the size of both the ring and\nlead tubes are fixed by imposing l = 4. The density plot\nappears quite complex and reflects the presence of van\nHove singularities in the system (see the insets of Fig. 2)\nbut certain regularities emerge. At a fixed gate voltage the position dependence of the transmission exhibit a\n\"chessboard\"-like behavior. The latter is broken for particular values of the gate voltage where zeros in the transmission occur. This is a typical topological effect which\nhas been shown analytically for one-dimensional rings.15\nThese zeros are a direct consequence of the breaking of\nthe inversion symmetry and are either due to destructive\ninterference events or due to the matching between the\ngate voltages and particular eigenvalues of the system.15\nWith the knowledge of the transmission function\ntn (E), it is straightforward to evaluate the I-V characteristics by applying the standard formalism based on the\nscattering theory of transport16\nZ\n2e \u221e\nIn =\ndE tn (E)[fL (E) \u2212 fR (E)].\n(2)\nh \u2212\u221e\n\n-1\n\n3 eV\n2.5 eV\n0 eV\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n(b)\n\n-1\n-1\n\n0\n\neVsd=\u03b3\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4: Lead-orientation dependent rectification, for three\ndifferent gate voltages Vg = 0, 2.5, 3 V, illustrated (a) for the\n90 deg configuration and (b) for the inversion symmetric one.\n\nFIG. 2: Density plot of the linear transmission tn (E \u2192 0) as\na function of the position n and of the gate voltage Vg .

The room temperature (kB T \u2243\n26 meV) will be considered in the numerical results, in\norder to keep consistency with the experiment.11\nFig. 3 displays the current at Vsd = 1 V for different\npositions of the second CNT tip and for different gate\nvoltages. This quantity has been used to produce the\nSTM images in Ref. 11, where three different values of\ngate voltages have been considered (here indicated as the\n\n\f3\nthree horizontal arrows in Fig. 3). The inversion symmetric configuration shows a marked current density for\nwide ranges of gate voltages, apart from two small intervals around 2.7 V and 5.8 V, respectively. At these\nvoltages, transport is much more favored in the lobes of\nthe ring which, for the choice of our size, emerge at the\n90 deg configuration (see the gray regions in the inset of\nFig. 3).\nFig. 4 (b) shows the I-V characteristics for the inversion symmetry position of the second lead (180 deg). The\nrectification effect given by the action of the gate potential are due to the finiteness of the ring band which, under a gate shift, is pushed in a region without states.\nDifferent is the situation in the 90 deg configuration\n(Fig. 4 (a)), where no marked asymmetry in the gated\nI-V curves can be detected. The vertical dashed lines in\nFig. 4 indicate the range of bias voltages investigated in\nRef. 11.
