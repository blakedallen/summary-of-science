Introduction\nThe Multiple Point Principle (MPP) states that fundamental physical parameters assume\nvalues that correspond to having a maximal number of different coexisting \"phases\" in the\nvacuum. There is phenomenological evidence suggesting that some or all of the about 20\nparameters in the Standard Model (SM) that are not predicted within the framework of\nthe SM correspond to the MPP values of these parameters[1, 2, 3]. The MPP also provides\na natural way to understand how fine-tuning comes about in a manner analogous to the\nway that the coexistence of the ice and liquid phases of water is required for a finite range\nof energies for the system all of which result in the fine-tuning of the temperature to 0o C\n(at 1 atm.).\nA cursory examination of the relation between the bare and dressed cosmological\nconstant that is maintained dynamically seems to demand at least a mild form of nonlocality which in turn makes us vulnerable to \"matricide-like\" paradoxes. Postulating\nMPP as a law of Nature seems to avoid paradoxes and at the same time provides an\neloquent mechanism of fine-tuning standard model parameters to experimentally observed\nvalues.\n1\n\n\fIn this contribution, we outline a new way of applying MPP by arguing that new\nphysics in the form of a fundamental (ontological) lattice (and the accompanying monopoles)\nwould necessarily appear at a scale for which an infinite monopole self coupling gives an\nupper limit (by the Triviality Theorem). The monopoles inherent to this lattice undergo a\nphase transition to and from a monopole condensate phase. By arguing that letting \u03bb run\nto infinity would set the (upper limit for the) fundamental cutoff scale and using that the\ngauge couplings approach constant values for \"large\" enough values of the self-coupling\n\u03bb, we get predictions for the gauge couplings by letting a curve that shares a point with a\nmonopole transition curve at small (negative) \u03bb values run to infinite \u03bb. These predictions\nare compared with the original lattice gauge theory implementation of MPP.\n\n2. Non-locality seems inherent to the problem of fine tuning\nIn essence, solving the problem of fine tuning means finding a way to render couplings (or\nother intensive quantities) dynamical. This invariably leads to non-locality - at least in a\nmild sense - in a way exemplified by the fine tuning problem for the dressed cosmological\nconstant [4]. If a coupling, e.g., the cosmological constant, is dynamical, locality dictates\nthat the value of the coupling at some spacetime point can directly depend on that\nspacetime point and indirectly on other spacetime points at earlier times but certainly\nnot on the future.\nBut if the bare cosmological constant immediately following the big bang is to already\nhave its value fine tuned very exactly to the value that makes the dressed cosmological\nconstant as small as that suggested phenomenologically, we have a problem with locality\nin the following sense: in order that the bare cosmological constant be relateable to the\nvalue of the dressed cosmological constant, the details of the dressed cosmological constant\nthat will evolve in the future must be known at the time of big bang. So a strict principle\nof locality is not allowed if we want to have a dynamically maintained bare coupling and\nrenormalization group corrections of a quantum field theory with a well-defined vacuum.\nAn allowable resolution would be to allow a mild class of non locality consisting of\nan interaction that is the same between any pair of points in spacetime independent of\nthe distance between these points. It would be difficult to see that such an interaction\nis non-local. Instead, such spacetime omnipresent fields - a sort of background that is\nforever everywhere the same - would likely be interpreted simply as constants of Nature.\nThe reparametrization invariance of general relativity implies this symmetry (i.e., the\nsame interaction between any pair of spacetime points). Leting \u03c6(x) stand for all the\nfields (and derivatives of same) of the theory, we use the fact that integrals (extensive\np\ndef R\nquantities) of the form Ifj [\u03c6(x)] = dx4 g(x)fj (\u03c6(x)) as well as any function of such\nintegrals are reparametrization invariant. Here the fj (\u03c6) are typically Lagrange densities.\nWe get a reparametrization invariant but non-local action \u015cnl by taking a non-linear\nfunction of the funtionals Ifj [\u03c6(x)] as \u015cnl .\nEach extensive quantity Ifj [\u03c6(x)] has a fixed value - call it Ifj f ixed (fixed in the sense of\nbeing a Law of Nature) for each imaginable Feynman path integral history of the Universe\nas it evolves from Big Bang at time tBB to Big Crunch at time tBC . The set {If ixed fj } of\nallowed values for the Ifj can be implemented as a \u03b4-function in the functional integration\nmeasure that defines our reparametrization\ninvariant non-linear (and therefore non-local)\nQ\naction \u015cnl : exp(Snl ({Ifj }) = j \u03b4(Ifj [\u03c6] \u2212 If ixed fj ).\n2\n\n\f3. The Multiple Point Principle (MPP)\nThe first appearence[1] of the MPP was in connection with predictions of the values\nof the non-Abelian gauge couplings. This was done in the the context of lattice gauge\ntheory using our so-called family replicated gauge group[5, 6] GF RGG (also sometimes\nreferred to as GAnti\u2212GU T ) which consists of the 3-fold replication of the Standard Model\ndef\n\nGroup (SMG): GF RGG = SMG \u2297 SMG \u2297 SMG = SMG3 (in the extended version:\n(SMG \u00d7 U(1))3 ) having one SMG factor for each generation of fermions and gauge\nbosons. We postulate that GF RGG is broken to the diagonal subgroup (i.e., the usual\nSMG) at roughly the Planck scale.\nIn the original context of predicting the standard model gauge couplings, MPP asserts\nthat the Planck scale values of the standard model gauge group couplings coincide with\nthe multiple point, i.e., the point or (hyper)surface that lies in the boundary separating\nthe maximum number of phases in the action parameter space corresponding to the gauge\ngroup GF RGG . The (Planck scale) predictions for the gauge couplings are subsequently\nidentified with the parameter values at the point in the action parameter space for the\ndiagonal subgroup of GF RGG that is inherited from the multiple point for GF RGG after\nthe Planck scale breakdown of the latter.\nThe phases to which we refer are usually dismissed as lattice artifacts (e.g., a Higgsed\nphase, a confined or Coulomb-like phase). Such phases have been studied extensively in\nthe literature for gauge groups such as U(1), SU(2) and SU(3)). One typically finds first\norder phase transitions between confined and Coulomb-like phases at critical values of the\naction parameters.\nWe suggest that these lattices phases correspond to phases that may be inherent to any\nregulator. As a regulator in some form (be it a lattice, strings or whatever) is needed for\nthe consistency of any quantum field theory, it is consistent to assume the existence of a\nfundamental regulator. The \"artifact\" phases that arise in a theory with such a regulator\n(that we have initially chosen to implement as a fundamental lattice) are accordngly\ntaken as ontological phases that have physical significance at the scale of the fundamental\nregulator (e.g., lattice). The assumption of an ontological fundamental regulator implies\nthe existence of monopoles in terms of which the regulator induced phase can also be\nstudied[6].\nFinding the multiple point in an action parameter space corresponding to the gauge\ngroup GRGG is more complicated than for groups such as U(1), SU(2) or SU(3) say. The\nboundaries between phases in the action parameter space (i.e., the phase diagram) must\nbe sought in a high dimensional parameter space essentially because GAnti\u2212GU T being a\nnon-simple group has many subgroups and invariant subgroups.\nIn fact there is a distinct phase for each subgroup pair (K, H) where K is a subgroup\nand H is an invariant subgroup such that H \u22b3 K \u2286 GF RGG . An element U \u2208 GF RGG\ncan be parameterized as U = U(g, k, h) where the Higgsed (gauge) degrees of freedom\nare elements g of the homogeneous space GF RGG /K. The (un-Higgsed) Coulomb-like and\nconfined degrees of freedom are respectively the elements k of the factor group K/H and\nthe elements h \u2208 H.\n\n3\n\n\f4. The History of the Universe as a Fine-tuner\nMPP functions as a fine-tuning mechanism when the extensive quantities If ixed fj introduced in Section 2 happen to have values that can only be realized in a universe having\ntwo (or more) coexisting phases the transition between which is first order in which case\nthe intensive quantity (typically a coupling) conjugate to If ixed fj is fine-tuned. It may\nbe useful to consider a familiar analogy: for a system consisting of H2 O there is a whole\nrange of energies (corresponding to the heat of melting) for which the system is forced to\nbe realized as coexisting ice and liquid phases in which case the energy-conjugate intensive\nparameter i.e., temperature, is fine-tuned (e.g., to 0o C for a presure of 1 atm.). A better\nimplementation of MPP would be the triple point of water where for a finite range of\nenergies and volumes three phases meet and 3-1=2 intensive parameters (the temprature\nand presure) are fine-tuned to the triple point values.\nIn 4-space, one generic possibility for having coexistent phases would be to have a\nphase with \u03c6us in an early epoch including say the universe as we know it and a phase\nwith \u03c6other in a later epoch:\nIf ixed fj = fj (\u03c6us )(tignit \u2212tBB )V3 +fj (\u03c6other )(tBC \u2212tignit )V3 (V3 is the 3-volume of the universe)\n(1)\n\nwhere tignit is the \"ignition\" time (in the future) at which there is a first order phase transition from the vacuum at \u03c6us to the later vacuum at \u03c6other . The value of the \"coupling\nconstant\" conjugate to If ixed fj gets fine tuned (unavoidably by assumption of the coexistence of the two phases separated by a first order transition) by a mechanism that also\ndepends on a phase that will first be realized in the future (at tignit ). Such a mechanism\nis non-local. Note in particular that the right hand side of Eqn. 1 depends on tignit .\nWe want to formally define a \"coupling constant\" conjugate to some extensive quantity If ixed fj .

Note that all the more or less randomly drawn non-locality curves intersect the\n\"normal physics\" curve near where the vacua are degenerate (i.e., the MPP solution).\nFigure 2: (Right) Many non-locality curves could lead to paradoxes similar to the \"matricide\" paradox. Such paradoxes are avoided if the value of mHiggs is fine-tuned to the\nmultiple point critical value. This corresponds to the intersection of the \"normal physics\"\ncurve with the \"possible nonlocality\" curve.\nwhere the right hand side of this equation, which also defines the (intensive) couplings\nm2Higgs and \u03bb, is recognised as a prototype scalar potential at the tree level. Of course\nthe form of Vnl is, at least a priori, completely unknown to us, so - for example - the\ncoupling constant m2Higgs cannot be calculated from Eqn. 4. The potential of Eqn. 4 with\nm2Higgs < 0 has an asymmetric minimun at, say, the value \u03c6us resulting in spontaneous\nsymmetry breakdown in the familiar way.\nActually we want to consider the potential Vef f having the two relative minima \u03c6us\nand \u03c6other - both at nonvanishing values of \u03c6 - alluded to at the beginning of this section.\nThe second minimum comes about at a value \u03c6other > \u03c6us when radiative corrections to\n(4) are taken into account and the top quark mass is not too large[3, 7, 8]. Which of these\nvacua - the one at \u03c6us or \u03c6other - would be the stable one in this two-minima Standard\nModel effective Higgs field potential depends on the value of m2Higgs . Since I2 and I4 are\ndef\n\n2 ,I4 })\nfunctions of tignit (as seen from Eqn. 1 with fj = \u03c62 or \u03c64 ), m2Higgs = \u2202Vnl ({I\nis also\n\u2202I2\na function of tignit .\nLet us first use \"normal physics\" to see how the relative depths of the two minima of\nthe double well are related to m2Higgs and to tignit . It can be deduced from[8] that a large\nnegative value of m2Higgs corresponds to the relative minimum Vef f (\u03c6other ) being deeper\nthan Vef f (\u03c6us ) (in which by assumption the Universe starts off following Big Bang) than\nfor less negative values of m2Higgs (see Fig. 1). It can also be argued quite plausibly that\na minimum in Vef f at \u03c6other much deeper than that at \u03c6us would correspond to an early\n(small) tignit inasmuch as the \"false\" vacuum at \u03c6us would be very unstable. However,\n\n5\n\n\fas the value of the potential at \u03c6other approaches that at \u03c6us , tignit becomes longer and\nlonger and approaches infinity as the values of Vef f at \u03c6us and \u03c6other become the same. The\ndevelopment of the double well potential and m2Higgs as a function of tignit is illustrated\nin Fig. 1. Note that the larger the difference |\u03c6other \u2212 \u03c6us | the more the realization of say\nIf ixed 2 will in general depend on tignit . If \u03c6us = \u03c6other , tignit plays no role in realizing e.g.\nIf ixed 2 and the value of m2Higgs becomes independent of tignit .\n\n5. Avoiding paradoxes arising from non-locality\nIn general the presence of non-locality leads to paradoxes. While the form that the nonlocal action (or potential Vnl in this discussion) is unknown to us, we make the 4 generically\nrepresentative guesses portrayed as the 4 non-locality curves in Fig. 1. In particular, nonlocality curves having a negative slope as a function of tignit lead to paradoxes in the\nfollowing manner. Consider the non-locality curve in Fig. 1 drawn with bold line that\nis redrawn in a rotated position in Fig. 2. Let us make the assumption that tignit is\nlarge and see that this leads to a contradiction. Assuming that tignit is large, it is seen\nfrom the non-locality function in Fig. 2 (call it m2Higgs nl (tignit ) to distinguish it from\nthe \"normal physics\" m2Higgs (tignit )) that this implies that the \"normal physics\" m2Higgs\nhas a large negative value. But a large negative value of m2Higgs corresponds in \"normal\nphysics\" to a (false) vacuum at \u03c6us that is very unstable and therefore to a very short tignit\ncorresponding to a rapid decay to the stable vacuum at \u03c6other . So the paradox appears:\nthe assumption of a large tignit implies a small tignit . This happens because in general\nm2Higgs (tignit ) 6= m2Higgs nl (tignit ) and is akin to the \"matricide\" paradox encountered for\nexample when dealing with \"time machines\". It has been suggested [9, 10, 11] that\nNature avoids such paradoxes by choosing a very clever solution in situations where these\nparadoxes lure.\nIn the case of the paradoxes that can come about due to non-locality of the type\nconsidered here, a clever solution that avoids paradoxes is available to Nature in the form\nof the Multiple Point Principle (MPP). The MPP solution corresponds to the intersection of the \"normal physics\" curve and the \"non-locality curve\" in Fig. 2. because here\nthe vacua at \u03c6us and \u03c6other are (essentially) degenerate. But at this intersection point,\nm2Higgs (tignit ) = m2Higgs nl (tignit ) so the paradox is avoided. So the paradox is avoided\nat the multiple point. But at the multiple point, an intensive parameter has its value\nfine-tuned for a wide range of values of the conjugate extensive quantity. Fine-tuning can\ntherefore be understood as a consequence of Nature's way of avoiding paradoxes that can\ncome about due to non-locality.\n\n6. Determining MPP gauge couplings at transition to monopole condensate\nUntil now we have talked about the determination of gauge couplings by finding the point\n(or surface) - the multiple point (surface) - where the maximum number of \"lattice artifact\" phases come together in the action parameter space of a lattice gauge theory. Here\nwe briefly sketch an alternative that potentially replaces the assumption of an ontological lattice by instead producing the different phases using the assumption of monopoles.\nMonopoles can cause different phases by condensing or not. Then the MPP prediction is\nthat the couplings realized in Nature are the values at the transition between a Coulomblike phase and a monopole condensate. Because it is not important whether the monopoles\n6\n\n\fare lattice artifact monopoles or fundamental monopoles or whatever, this way of determining the MPP gauge couplings offer the possibility of exonerating the original method\nthat considers \"lattice artifact\" phases.\nA simple effective dynamical description of confinement in a pure U(1) lattice gauge\ntheory is the dual Abelian Higgs model of scalar monopoles[12] We shall shortly see that\nthe dualized U(1) lattice theory can be rewritten as an R lattice gauge theory on the\ndual lattice with a \"non-linear\" Higgs field. In earlier work[13] the formulation dual to\nthe renormalization group improved Coleman-Weinberg effective potential (at tree level\nthis is just Eqn. 4) was considered in the two loop approximation. In this work the\ntransition to a monopole condensate was found along a phase transition curve in (\u03bb, g 2)\nspace situated in the region with negative \u03bb of the order of -10. Here \u03bb and g 2 are\nrunning couplings for which one would think that the renormalization point \u03bc should\nbe taken to be of the order of the Higgs monopole mass or the VEV of the monopole\nfield in the condensed phase. The negative \u03bb is not alarming for the existence of the\nphase transition even if one requires a bottom for the Hamiltonian because by running to\na higher renormalization point (identified with field strength) the self-coupling can run\npositive. In the earlier work[13] the MPP philosophy was to take the actual coupling\ndirectly related to the couplings on the phase transition curve just mentioned. In the\npresent paper we want to consider MPP applied to bare couplings. If bare couplings are\nconsidered, one must declare the scale of the bare coupling. To avoid a negative \u03bb, one\nshould at least choose the ontological cutoff scale high enough that \u03bb is positive. On the\nother hand we know from the Triviality Theorem that new physics (e.g., a fundamental\nlattice) must show up at the latest at the energy where the monopole self-coupling \u03bb\nbecomes infinite due to renormalization group running.\nSo we have an allowed interval for the scale of the fundamental lattice: it must be\ngreater than that for which \u03bbrunning becomes positive but less than the scale at which \u03bb\nruns to infinity.\nNow it turns out that as \u03bb runs to \"large\" values, the dependence of g 2 on \u03bb becomes\nvery weak. So by running the g 2 (\u03bb) curve from the one point that it has in common with\nthe above-mentioned phase transtion curve along which there is a Coulomb - condensate\nphase transition to \"large\" enough \u03bb values, we get a good candidate for the running g 2\nvalue at the scale of the fundamental regulator (lattice).\nSo what we now need is a justification for assuming that \u03bb is \"large\" enough. There\nare a couple of justification candidates. One approach would be to make the assumption\nthat the approximation of a continuum spacetime is good all the way up to the regularization scale given by the Triviality Theorem bound. Since this bound is determined by\nrunning\n\u03bb \u2192 \u221e we have justified the assumption of large \u03bb. The second approach to justifying the assumption of large \u03bb entails the assumption of an ontological lattice and a little\ncalculation.\nThe calculation would start by using dualization to rewrite a U(1) lattice gauge theory\ndual\ninto a theory with the gauge group Z (under addition) on the dual lattice links q q. Next\nwe endeavor to get this integer gauge group from the group of real numbers R by using\ndual\na weighting which for each dual link q q is a sum of infinitely many \u03b4-functions in the\ngauge group R minus an integer n over which we sum:\n\n7\n\n\fYX\n\ndual\n\u03b4(\u03b8R ( q q) \u2212 2\u03c0n).\n\nq n\u2208Z\n\ndual\n\nq\n\nBy putting in the \u03b4-function factor, we essentially go from a real number gauge group\nto an integer gauge group. Now the trick is to get this series of \u03b4-function weightings for\neach dual link by formally introducing a series of \"non-linear\" Higgs fields i.e., a scaler\nfield on each site that has the complex unit circle as its target space. By choosing the\nunitary gauge we can take the value unity for this non-linear gauge field. Then the lowest\ndual\norder action contribution (from the kinetic term of the Higgs field) will be \u03b2R cos(\u03b8R ( q q))\nfor each dual link (summed over all dual links). If \u03b2R goes to infinity, the exponentiated\naction for each link will be a weight of the form we want (i.e., a sum of infinitely many\n\u03b4-functions).\n\n7. Conclusion\nWe attempt to justify the assertion that fine-tuning in Nature seems to imply a fundamental form of non-local interaction. This could be manifested in a phenomenologically\nacceptable form as everywhere in spacetime identical interactions between any pair of\nspacetime points. This would be implemented by requiring the non-local action to be\ndiffeomorphism invariant.\nNext we put forth our multiple point principle[1, 2] which states that coupling parameters in the Standard Model tend to assume values that correspond to the values of action\nparameters lying at the junction of a maximum number of regulator induced phases (e.g.,\nso-called \"lattice artifact phases\") separated from one another in action parameter space\nby first order transitions. The action. which of course is defined on a gauge group (e.g.,\nthe non-simple SM gauge group) governs fluctuation patterns along the various subgroup\ncombinations (K, H) with H \u22b3 K \u2286 G that characterize the phases that come together\nat the multiple point.\nWe then consider extensive quantities that are functions of functionals Ifj [\u03c6(x)] that\nare essentially Feymann path histories of the Universe for functions fj (\u03c6) of the fields\n\u03c6(x) and derivatives of these fields. We then think of the generic situation in which\nthese extensive quantities can happen to be fixed at values that require the universe to\nbe realized as two or more coexisting phases[4]. We draw on the analogy to the forced\ncoexistence of ice and liquid water that occurs for a whole range of possible total energies\nbecause of the finite heat of melting (first order phase transition). With our multiple point\nprinciple, the intensive quantities (couplings) conjugate to extensive quantities fixed in\nthis way become fine-tuned in a manner analogous to the fine tuning of temperature to\n0o C (at 1 atm.) when the total energy of a system of H2 O is such that the system can\nonly be realized as coexisting ice and liquid phases.\nOne generic way of having coexisting phases in a quantum field theory in 3+1 dimensions would be to have different phases in different epochs of the lifetime of the\nUniverse with phase transitions occuring at various times in the course of the lifetime of\nthe Universe. If the transitions were first order, one would have fine-tuning of (intensive)\ncouplings conjugate to extensive quantitity values that can only be realized by having coexisting (i.e., more than one) phases. But such a fine-tuning would involve non-locality:\n\n8\n\n\fTable 1: Table of values of \u03b1\u22121 (\u03bcP l. ). Recall that these values are those for each of\nthe three U(1)s, each of the three SU(2)s and each of the three SU(3)s in our family\nreplicated gauge group GF RGG because GF RGG is the 3-fold Cartesian product of the usual\nstandard model group (SMG). Following the Planck scale breakdown of GF RGG to the\ndiagonal subroup (isomorphic to the usual SMG) the \u03b1\u22121 (\u03bcP l.) values for the non-Abelian\nsubgroups get multiplied by a factor 3 whereas \u03b1U\u22121(1) (\u03bcP l. ) gets enhanced by a factor\nsomewhat greater than six (\u2248 6.5) for reasons having to do with the three U(1)s of GF RGG\nbeing Abelian.[2] For comparison, the last row gives experimental values of \u03b1\u22121 (\u03bcP l ) that\nhave been extrapolated to Planck scale using the renormalization group (with minimal\nstandard model) and subseqently divided by factors 3 and 6.5 in respectively the nonAbelian and Abelian cases.\nNaive continuum limit\nParisi Improved\nMonopole 1-loop\nExperimental values (Planck scale)1\n\nU(1)\n12.4\n8.25\n7.20\n8.22\n\nSU(2)/Z2\n21.7\n15.4\n15.0\n16.4\n\nSU(3)/Z3\n26.7\n16.3\n18.2\n17.9\n\nthe fine-tuned values of coupling constants would depend on future phase transitions into\nphases that do not even exist at the time such couplings are fine-tuned.\nEven non-locality of this sort (i.e., non-localy manifested as a diffeomorphism invariant\ncontribution to the action) can lead to paradoxes of the \"matricide paradox\" type. We\nargue that such paradoxes are avoided when Nature chooses the multiple point principle\nsolution to the problem of finetuning[4].\nThe first formulation of the MPP arose in our predictions of the SM gauge coupling\nconstants[1, 2]. This was done in the context of lattice gauge theory using our family\nreplicated gauge group SMG\u2297SMG\u2297SMG having one SMG for each family of fermions\n(and bosons!)[5, 6]. This is broken to the diagonal subgroup (which is isomorphic to the\nusual SMG) at roughly the Planck scale. The predictions for the \"Naive continuum\nlimit\" and \"Parisi Improved\" values of \u03b1\u22121 (\u03bcP l ) (see table) rely on on the assumption\nthat what are usually regarded a \"latice artifact\" are in fact ontological. This assumption\nis avoided in recent work that uses a monopole technology to make MPP predictions of\ngauge couplings. These is in rather good agreement of the \"Monopole 1-loop\" with the\noriginal predictions (see table of \u03b1\u22121 (\u03bcP l.) values)\nWe use the Triviality Theorem in support of our requirement that the monopole (on\nthe dual lattice) attain an infinite self-coupling at the lattice scale. This requirement\nexcludes having a fixed point in the running \u03bb value before reaching the lattice scale\nbecause \u03b2\u03bb = 0 at any scale under that of the lattice would stop the running before \u03bb\nbecomes infinite.\nIn the two loop approximation it turns out that zeros in \u03b2\u03bb show up at g 2 \u2248 19\nor above. But if we trust the Triviality Theorem, we must assume that going to three\nloops (or more) would remove the two loop (artifact) \u03b2\u03bb zeros or that we already are at\nsufficiently strong g 2 , \u03bb so that the optimal order is one-loop and that going to two-loops\nintroduces error. For now, we use the one loop calculation in calculating the values in the\ntable and postpone a two loop or other attempts at a more accurate treatment.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\n[1] D. Bennett and H.B.
