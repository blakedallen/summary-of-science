The study of the average\nin-plane transverse momentum, hpx i, as a function of rapidity, y, provides an easy and intuitive way of quantizing the directed flow [8]. For beam energy range up\nto a few GeV per nucleon, the experimental [8\u201324] and\ntheoretical [25\u201343] studies of this phenomenon have provided important understanding of its features. Experimentally, the dependences of directed flow on incident\nenergy [9,16,19,18,22], centrality [9,15,17,19\u201322], particle\ntype [10,16,17,19\u201322], system size [9,18,22] and isospin\n[21] have been determined. These main features have\nbeen quantitatively reproduced by microscopic transport\nmodels of either Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD)\n[29,33,15,16,20,41,24] or Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck\n(BUU) [11,30,31,36,38,17,40,42,43,24] type. Despite all\nthese efforts, a definite conclusion on the EoS has not\nyet been achieved. As pointed out early on [27,31,32],\nthe momentum dependent interactions (MDI) play a crucial role in the determination of the EoS. The directed\nflow is influenced in addition by the (in-medium) nucleonnucleon cross section (\u03c3nn ) [36,37,44]. Moreover, consistency is needed in deriving EoS together with both MDI\nand \u03c3nn [35,43]. The importance to combine various observables, each sensitive (ideally) to one particular aspect\nof the parameters that influence EoS was emphasized recently [4].\nThe results quoted above have been obtained from the\nanalysis of integrated directed flow. The first analysis of\ndifferential directed flow (DDF) was introduced by Pan\nand Danielewicz [36], who studied the transverse momentum (pt ) dependence of the first order Fourier coefficient,\n\nWe present new experimental data on directed flow in collisions of Au+Au, Xe+CsI and Ni+Ni at incident energies from\n90 to 400A MeV. We study the centrality and system dependence of integral and differential directed flow for particles\nselected according to charge. All the features of the experimental data are compared with Isospin Quantum Molecular\nDynamics (IQMD) model calculations in an attempt to extract information about the nuclear matter equation of state\n(EoS). We show that the combination of rapidity and transverse momentum analysis of directed flow allow to disentangle\nvarious parametrizations in the model. At 400A MeV, a soft\nEoS with momentum dependent interactions is best suited\nto explain the experimental data in Au+Au and Xe+CsI,\nbut in case of Ni+Ni the model underpredicts flow for any\nEoS. At 90A MeV incident beam energy, none of the IQMD\nparametrizations studied here is able to consistently explain\nthe experimental data.\n\nPACS: 25.70.Lm, 21.65.+f, 25.75.Ld\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of collective flow in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions has been an intense field of research for the\npast twenty years (see Refs. [1,2] for recent reviews). The\nultimate motivation for the whole endeavour has been\nthe extraction of the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear\nmatter (see Ref. [3] for an early account and Ref. [4] for\nmore recent ones). Moreover, the study of highly complex\n(quantum) many-body dynamics of heavy-ion collisions\nis in itself a challenging task.\nThe (in-plane) directed (or sideward) flow was pre-\n\n1\n\n\fple). The PW measures the velocity of particles via ToF\nwith an average resolution of 150 ps. For the CDC, the\nrelative momentum resolution \u03c3pt /pt varies from 4% for\npt < 0.5 GeV/c to about 12% for pt =2 GeV/c. For more\ndetails on the detector configuration for this experiment\nsee Ref. [51].\n\n3\n\npt(0)\n\nv1 = hcos(\u03c6)i, where \u03c6 is the angle with respect to the reaction plane. The DDF was studied around the balance\nenergy (Ebal , which is the energy of disappearance of flow\n[14,16,23]) by Li and Sustich [44], who unraveled its interesting patterns. They also pointed out the marked sensitivity of DDF to both EoS and nucleon-nucleon cross\nsection (\u03c3nn ). At AGS energies the DDF was studied\nboth experimentally [45] and theoretically [46,47]. Recently, we have completed the first experimental analysis\nof DDF for Au+Au collisions at incident energies from 90\nto 400A MeV [48]. We have found interesting patterns of\nthe differential flow, evolving as a function of incident energy, particle type and rapidity. In particular, the study\nof high-pt particles is important because, as proposed in\nRef. [49], they are good messengers from the high density\nstate of the collision. The DDF could additionally provide snapshots of the flow development during the time\nof the collision.\nIn this paper we present new experimental data on directed flow in collisions of Au+Au, Xe+CsI and Ni+Ni.\nThe complete coverage of the FOPI detector makes possible precision studies of flow, refining our earlier studies\ndone with Phase I data [15,19,20,22]. Following our recent exploration of the energy range of 90 to 400A MeV\nfor Au+Au [48], we focus here on the centrality (for\nAu+Au) and on system size dependence of directed flow.\nThis analysis has been performed for the incident energies of 250 and 400 A MeV, for particles with Z=1 and\nZ=2. To avoid overloading, only a selection of results is\nincluded in the body of the paper. In the Appendix we\nprovide additional figures to complete the data set. After\ndescribing the detector, the method of analysis, and the\ncorrections applied to data, we study the centrality and\nsystem dependence of directed flow over the complete forward rapidity range, both in terms of (pt ) integrated and\nin a differential way. All the features of the experimental\ndata are then compared with IQMD model calculations\nfor the incident energies of 90 and 400A MeV.\n\nAu+Au E=250 AMeV M4 Z=1\n\n2.5\n2\n\u03b8lab=34\n\nCDC\nA=1,2,3\n\n1.5\n\no\n\no\n\n30\n\n1\n0.5\n\n145\n\n0\n-1.5\n\nPW\nZ=1\n\no\n\no\n\n1.2\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n(0)\n\ny\n\nFIG. 1.

The thicker lines mark the geometrical acceptance of different subdetectors.\n\nThe phase-space coverage of the FOPI detector is presented in Fig. 1 for particles with Z=1 (for PW) and\nA=1,2,3 (for CDC), measured in semi-central collisions\nAu+Au at incident energy of 250A MeV. To compare\ndifferent incident energies and particle species, we use\nnormalized center-of-mass (c.m.) transverse momentum\n(per nucleon) and rapidity, defined as\n\nII. SET-UP AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\n(0)\n\npt\n\nThe data have been measured with a wide phase-space\ncoverage using the FOPI detector [50] at GSI Darmstadt.\nThe reaction products are identified by charge (Z) in the\nforward Plastic Wall (PW) at 1.2\u25e6 < \u03b8lab < 30\u25e6 using\ntime-of-flight (ToF) and specific energy loss. In the Central Drift Chamber (CDC), covering 34\u25e6 < \u03b8lab < 145\u25e6,\nthe particle identification is on mass (mass number A),\nobtained using magnetic rigidity and the energy loss. For\nPW the Z resolution is 0.13 charge units for Z=1 and\n0.14 for Z=2, while for CDC the mass resolution varies\nfrom 0.20 to 0.53 mass units for A=1 to A=4. The contamination of Z=1 in the Z=2 sample varies from 6% to\n10% (from Ni+Ni at 250A MeV to Au+Au at 400A MeV)\nfor the PW and is up to 20% for the CDC (where it\nis the contamination of A=1,2 and 3 in the A=4 sam-\n\n= (pt /A)/(pc.m.\nP /AP ),\n\ny (0) = (y/yP )c.m. ,\n\nwhere the subscript P denotes the projectile. For the\nPW coverage, shadows around \u03b8lab = 7\u25e6 and 19\u25e6 are\nvisible, arising from subdetector borders and frames.\nFor the centrality selection we used the charged particle multiplicities,P\nclassifiedP\ninto five bins, M1 to M5.

Upper panel: the resolution of the reconstructed\nreaction plane (squares) and the corresponding correction factors (dots). Lower panel: v1 values for the true (continuous\nline) and reconstructed and corrected (dashed line) reaction\nplane. IQMD HM events were used for these studies.\n\nThe accuracy of the reaction plane correction procedure was checked using Isospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) [33] events analyzed in the same way\nas the data. The results are shown in Fig. 2 for IQMD\nevents at 400A MeV. The upper panel presents the resolution and the correction factor as a function of the\nimpact parameter, b. Their dependence on centrality\nreflects mainly the dependence of the strength of the\ndirected flow (see lower panel), but also a finite number effect [8], evident towards peripheral collisions. The\nlower panel of Fig. 2 presents the centrality dependence\nof integrated v1 values for Z=1 particles (for the forward\nhemisphere), derived from IQMD events in two cases: i)\nwith respect to the true reaction plane (known in the\nmodel) and ii) with respect to the reconstructed reaction\nplane and using the correction according to [52] (correction factors of the upper panel of Fig. 2). The agreement\nbetween the two cases is perfect, down to most peripheral\ncollisions, where correction factors up to 2 are necessary.\nAlternative methods of flow analysis have been proposed recently [53]. However, because, for our energy\ndomain, the flow of nucleons is at its maximum and pro-\n\nA. The reaction plane determination and the\ncorrection for its resolution\n\nThe reaction plane has been reconstructed event-byevent using the transverse momentum method [8]. All\ncharged particles detected in an event have been used,\nexcept a window around midrapidity (|y (0) | < 0.3) to\nimprove the resolution. The particle-of-interest has been\nexcluded to prevent autocorrelations.\nThe correction of the extracted values due to the reconstructed reaction plane fluctuations has been done using\nthe recipe of Ollitrault [52]. The resolution of the reaction plane azimuth, \u2206\u03c6, can be extracted by randomly\ndividing each event in two subevents and calculating for\neach one the reaction plane orientation, \u03a61 and \u03a62 [8,52].\nFrom the resolution, quantified as hcos(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )i, the\ncorrection factors, 1/hcos \u2206\u03c6i can be calculated [52] (see\nRef. [51] for more technical details). For the experimental data the correction factors for the centrality bins M3,\n3\n\n\fv1\n\nduced particles are very rare, the impact of these refined\nmethods is expected to be minor.\n\nAu+Au E=400 AMeV Z=1\n(0)\n\nB.

Because of the directed flow,\nthe average number of particles detected over the full PW\nsubdetector is up to 2 times higher in-plane than out of\nthe reaction plane. As a consequence, the losses due to\nmultiple hit are strongly correlated with the directed flow\nand follow its dependences on incident energy, centrality\nand system size. These losses lead to an underestimation\nof the measured directed flow and need to be taken into\naccount. We developed a correction procedure based on\nthe experimental data, by exploiting the DDF left-right\nsymmetry with respect to midrapidity. The correction\nacts upon v1 values (namely only on average values) and\nis deduced for each system, energy and centrality separately. Due to the flow profile in the polar angle, it depends also on transverse momentum. It is larger for Z=2\ncompared to Z=1 particles. The correction was derived\nin a window around midrapidity (|y (0) | < 0.1) and prop(0)\nagated for other rapidity windows for each pt bin along\nthe lines of constant \u03b8lab to follow the detector segmentation. It reaches up to 12% for Au+Au at 400A MeV\nand is almost negligible at 90A MeV. At 400A MeV it is\nup to 5% for Xe+CsI and up to 2% for Ni+Ni.\nThe procedure was checked and validated using IQMD\nevents passed through a complete GEANT [55] simulation of the detector.

Additional detector\nshadows around 7\u25e6 and 19\u25e6 are present too. We have\nstudied the effect of the FOPI acceptance using IQMD\ntransport model [33].

IQMD SM events for the incident energy of 400A MeV, M4 centrality bin were used for this\ncomparison. With the present configuration of the detector, the measured v1 values are very close to the ideal\ncase. We note that, for our published directed flow data\n[15,19,20,22], although the effect of the FOPI acceptance\non the directed flow results was quite small [15,54], its\nmagnitude was comparable to the difference between soft\nand hard EoS.\nAn important ingredient in the present analysis is the\ncorrection for distortions due to multiple hit losses. As an\nexample, in case of PW, despite its good granularity (512\n4\n\n\fIntegrated v1\n\nity bin. The v1 values extracted from IQMD events as\ninputs into a complete GEANT simulation of the detector (and analyzed in exactly the same way as the data),\nwithout (dotted line) and with (dashed line) the multiple hit correction, are compared with the true v1 values,\nobtained from standard IQMD events (actually the same\nevents used for the GEANT simulation) with only a simple geometric FOPI filter (full line). It is obvious that\nthe correction is restoring the \"true\" v1 values (IQMD)\nfrom the \"measured\" GEANT values. Also, the correction used for the data is quantitatively reproduced by\nthese simulations. Note that, because of larger multiplicities for Z=1 particles from IQMD (see Section IV),\nthe correction is larger in the simulations than in the\ndata. As a result of these studies, all the experimental\ndata (both differential and integrated) have been corrected according to the procedure described above.\nThe only source of systematic error on our measured\nv1 values could be the correction for multiple hit losses\noutlined above. However, as we have demonstrated based\non complete GEANT simulations, this correction is well\nunderstood. As a result, the systematic error depends on\n(0)\nincident energy, centrality, particle type and pt . It is\nbelow 5% on the differential v1 . There are exceptions\nfor some points, for which the systematic error arises\n(0)\nfrom (rapidity-dependent) regions in pt in which detector shadows are influencing the data. For those particular points the systematic error is already included in the\nplots. For the integrated v1 values the error is slightly\nsmaller, up to 4%, including the influence of the uncovered region of \u03b8lab = 30\u25e6 \u2212 34\u25e6 .

Centrality dependence of the integrated directed\nflow as a function of rapidity for Au+Au at 400A MeV for\nZ=2 particles. The lines are joining the symbols to guide the\neye.\n\nIII. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE DATA\n\nbehaviour of the slope at midrapidity, namely the maximum for intermediate impact parameters (M4 bin), is\nevident only for the weighted v1 values (lower panel of\nFig. 5). The asymmetries (v1 values, upper panel) are\nthe same around midrapidity for M3 and M4 centrality\nbins. Second, in both observables, the most significant\ndependence on centrality is taking place in the spectator\nregion (roughly y (0) > 0.5) and it is more pronounced\nfor the weighted v1 values. Both the asymmetries and\nthe in-plane transverse momentum reflect the influence\nof the participant and of the spectator size controlled by\nthe variation of the centrality. These distributions are\ninherently a result of the superposition of collective and\nthermal contributions [22]. For a given flow magnitude,\nhigher temperatures (presumably achieved for more central collision) would translate into a smaller effective flow.\nIn Fig. 6 we show the centrality dependence of the\ndifferential flow for Z=2 particles for Au+Au collisions\nat 400A MeV. Three centrality bins (different panels) are\ncompared for three rapidity windows (different symbols).\nThe lines are polynomial fits to guide the eye. The rapidity dependence of the DDF in different centrality bins\nfollows the rapidity dependence of the integrated flow\n\nA. Centrality dependence\n\nBy varying the centrality of the collision one aims at\ncontrolling both the size of the participant fireball (and\nconsequently the magnitude of the achieved compression\nand subsequent expansion) and the size of the spectator\nfragment region. While semi-central collisions could provide information preferentially on (density dependent)\nEoS, more peripheral reactions can help in pinning down\nthe MDI [4].\nFigure 5 shows the centrality dependence of the directed flow for Au+Au at 400A MeV for Z=2 particles. Plotted as a function of rapidity are the (pt ) integrated v1 values (upper panel) and those integrated\nvalues weighted by the average transverse momentum,\n(0)\nhpt i, for the respective rapidity bin. This weighted v1\nquantity is proportional to the average in-plane transverse momentum hpx i (v1 = hpx /pt i) and was chosen due\nto its convenience in applying the corrections discussed\nin Section II B. First, one can notice that the known\n\n5\n\n\fv1\n\nmomenta are seen towards the projectile rapidity as a\nresult of the influence of the spectator matter.\nSimilar data as those presented in Fig. 5 and 6 are presented in the Appendix for Z=1 particles in Au+Au at\n400A MeV and for Z=1 and Z=2 particles at 250A MeV\n(Fig. 19 to Fig. 24).\n\nM3\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n(0)\n\ny =0.9-1.1\n(0)\ny =0.7-0.9\ny(0)=0.5-0.7\n\n0.2\n\nB. System size dependence\n\n0\n\nM4\n\n0.6\n\nAs for the centrality variation, by varying the system\nsize one aims to control the size of both the participant\nand the spectator. However, the question whether transparency plays a role in case of lighter systems, needs to\nbe addressed simultaneously, as it results in a decrease\nof the achieved compression. In addition, the surface (or\nsurface-to-volume ratio) can play an important role. It\nwas suggested that the system size dependence of the\ndirected flow could give insights about \u03c3nn [32].\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nM5\n\n0.6\n\npt(0)\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.6\n\nAu+Au\n\n0.2\n\n0.75\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\npt(0)\n\n0.5\n0.25\n\nFIG. 6.

As we have\nalready discussed in [48], the shape of the DDF (a gradual\ndevelopment of a limiting value, followed by a decrease\n(0)\nat high pt ) could be a result of the collision dynamics.\nPart of the high-pt particles could have been emitted at\na pre-equilibrium stage, therefore not reaching the maximum compression stage of the reaction. However, this\npossibility seems to be ruled out by the observation that\nthe high-pt particles originate preferentially from highdensity regions of the collision [49].\nThe arrows in Fig. 6 mark the values of the aver(0)\nage pt for the corresponding centrality bin, according to\nthe symbols. For this incident energy of 400A MeV the\nvalue of the projectile momentum in the c.m. system is\n433 MeV/c per nucleon. Higher values of average transverse momenta are seen for more central collisions as a\nresult of a stronger expansion from a bigger and more\n(0)\ncompressed source.

[34], who, within a BUU model, have found a linear\ndependence of the transverse pressure (leading to transverse momentum transfer) with the reaction time (passage time). Westfall et al. [14] have related the A\u22121/3 dependence of Ebal to a competition between the attractive\nmean field (associated with the surface, so scaling with\nA2/3 ) and the repulsive nucleon-nucleon interaction (scaling as A). This competition between the two components\n\n1/3\n\n7\n\n1/3\n\n\fite fragments compared to data [57]. For instance, for\nAu+Au at incident energy of 400A MeV, M4 centrality, integrated Z=2 yields relative to Z=1 are 1/4.7 for\nthe experimental data while IQMD predicts 1/25 for HM\nand 1/15 for SM (these ratios do not depend on including\nMDI or not).\nAs cluster formation and flow are intimately related,\none cannot simply neglect this dramatic discrepancy. It\nis difficult to assess whether this strong dependence of\nfragment production on EoS parametrization is a genuine physical effect or is only particular to IQMD model.\nWe note that most of the present models used in heavyion collisions at our energies involve a rather simple phase\nspace coalescence mechanism to produce composite particles [43,49] (IQMD uses the coalescence in coordinate\nspace only [33]). Efforts to identify the fragments early\nin the collision might contribute to clarify this aspect\n[58]. Promising theoretical candidates to accomplish the\ntask of realistic fragment formation could be AMD-type\nmodels [37].\n\nIntegrated v1\n\nmay be the origin of the quoted scaling of the transverse\n1/3\n1/3\npressure with (AP + AT ). Earlier studies devoted to\nthe slope of hpx i\u2212y distributions (which translates into a\nflow angle) have experimentally confirmed such a scaling\n[18,22]. We note that, in an ideal hydrodynamics the flow\nangle is a pure geometric quantity and does not depend\non the system size [56]. The system size dependences\npresented above may be an interesting effect of the nuclear forces and/or a consequence of the non-equilibrium\nnature of the heavy-ion collisions.\nIn Fig. 9 we present the differential flow for the three\nsystems at 250A MeV, M4 centrality bin, for Z=2 particles in three windows of rapidity (the three panels). The\n(0)\narrows mark the values of the average pt for the corresponding centrality bin, according to the symbols. For\nthis incident energy of 250A MeV the value of the projectile momentum in the c.m. system is 342 MeV/c per nucleon. As seen already in Fig. 7, for all rapidity windows\n(0)\nthe hpt i depend on the system size (again breaking the\nscaling expected from hydrodynamics), suggesting an increase of the compression and expansion with the system\nsize.\nSimilar data as those presented in Fig. 8 and 9 are presented in the Appendix for Z=1 particles at 250A MeV\nand for Z=1 and Z=2 particles at 400A MeV (Fig. 25 to\nFig. 30).\n\n0.6\n\nAu+Au E=400 AMeV M4 IQMD HM\n0.5\n0.4\n\nIV. MODEL COMPARISON\n0.3\n\nThe IQMD transport model [33,41] is widely used for\ninterpreting the data in our energy domain [33,16,20,39].\nWe use two different parametrizations of the EoS, a\nhard EoS (compressibility K= 380 MeV) and a soft EoS\n(K= 200 MeV), both with MDI, labeled HM and SM, respectively and without MDI - H and S, respectively. We\nf ree\nfor all\nuse the free nucleon-nucleon cross section, \u03c3nn\ncases, but for the energy of 90A MeV in addition we conf ree\nsider the case of \u03c3nn = 0.8\u03c3nn\n. The events produced\nby the model are filtered by the experimental filter and\nanalyzed in a similar way as the experimental data. This\ncomprises the same recipe for the centrality selection and\nthe same way of reaction plane reconstruction and correction. However, for the energy of 90A MeV, due to a\nweak flow signal (see below) we prefer to use the true\nreaction plane for the model calculations. In what concerns the reaction plane resolution at 400A MeV, it is in\nthe model very similar compared to data. For instance,\nfor M4 centrality bin, for IQMD SM the correction factors are 1.03, 1.05 and 1.24 for Au, Xe and Ni systems,\nrespectively.\n\n0.2\n\np\nn\nall,xA\nall,xZ\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\ny\n\n(0)\n\nFIG. 10.

This coexistence is different for the two\nparticle species. We noticed that the above characteristics of the model calculations depend on centrality as\nwell, both the magnitude of the dual flow and the particle dependence being enhanced for more peripheral collisions. The model features are clearly not supported by\nthe data, which show a monotonic repulsive flow over all\nthe rapidity domain, both for Z=1 and Z=2 particles,\nas seen in Fig. 12. For the experimental data, for the\ncentrality M4 studied here, the reaction plane correction\nfactor is 1.54.\nA two-component flow was observed earlier in QMD\ncalculations of semi-peripheral Ca+Ca collisions at\n350A MeV [39]. That study pointed out its high sensitivity to MDI. But, unless the discrepancy between the\ncalculations and the measured data is resolved, any conclusion on the sensitivity of the directed flow on the EoS,\n\u03c3nn or MDI is meaningless for energies around Ebal . It\nis not clear for the moment whether the particle dependence of the dual flow is not an artifact of the treatment\nof composite particles in the model. We note that measurements of Ebal for different particle types [14,23] did\nnot reveal, so far, any dual flow. Calculations with a\n\nB. Integrated values\n\nWe start our comparison of the data with the IQMD\nmodel at the incident energy of 90A MeV, for the M4\ncentrality bin.\nIn Fig. 12 we show the rapidity dependence of the integrated v1 values for particles with Z=1 (upper panel) and\nZ=2 (lower panel). For both species the measured values are compared to the IQMD calculations for HM and\nSM parametrizations. For the HM case an additional set\nf ree\nof calculations has been performed using \u03c3nn = 0.8\u03c3nn\n(labeled HM.8 in Fig. 12). For the HM case the statistical errors are plotted. For the other cases the errors are\ncomparable. For data the errors are in most cases smaller\nthan the dimension of the points. The calculated values\nof the directed flow depend both on the parametrized\nEoS and, more pronounced, on \u03c3nn . This dependence\nis apparently of different magnitude for Z=1 and Z=2\nparticles.\nFor the model calculations there is a coexistence of attractive (negative v1 values) and repulsive (positive v1 )\nflow, manifested as a function of rapidity (we shall call\n9\n\n\fIntegrated v1\n\nIntegrated v1\n\nE=400 AMeV M4\nAu+Au\n\n0.4\n\nHM\nH\nSM\nS\n\n0.2\n\nZ=1\n0\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\nE=400 AMeV M4\nAu+Au\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nZ=2\n\n0\n0.6\n\nXe+CsI\n\nHM\nH\nSM\nS\n\nXe+CsI\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\n\nData\n0\n0.3\n\nData\n\n0\n\nNi+Ni\n\nNi+Ni\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1.2\n(0)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n(0)\n\ny\n\ny\n\nFIG. 13.

As Fig. 13, but for Z=2 particles. For the HM\ncase the statistical errors of the model are plotted.\n\nIn case of Ni+Ni system the dependence on EoS is already negligible, but obviously the model underestimates\nthe flow. One parameter of the model, the Gaussian\nwidth L, which is the phase space extension of the wave\npacket of the particle (and acting as an effective interaction range) has been found to influence the directed flow\nconsiderably [41]. A decrease of L for lighter systems has\nbeen advocated with the argument of maximum stability\nof nucleonic density profiles [41]. As no clear prescription\nexists for handling the value of L, we prefer to use a constant value of L=8.66 fm2 throughout the present work.\nA smaller L would lead to an increase of the directed flow\n[41] and may cure the discrepancy that we observe for the\nNi+Ni system, but will affect unfavorably the comparison in case of Xe+CsI system. These effects may reflect\nthe importance played (via the interaction range) by the\nsurface. A complete understanding of this aspect is a\nnecessary step towards establishing the bulk properties\nof the nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions.\nWe note that comparisons of integrated directed flow\nfor Au+Au system using QMD-type models favored\nmostly a soft EoS [15,54] but a hard EoS was also found\nto explain another set of experimental data [16].\nIn Fig. 15 we present the comparison of the measured\n\nBUU model [44] found a dual flow only in a (pt ) differential way, but otherwise monotonic behavior of hpx i \u2212 y\ndistributions. Recent experimental investigations of flow\nin light systems at Ebal pointed out interesting aspects\nof flow of light isotopes and heavy fragments, but again\nthe balance energy was found not to depend on particle\ntype [59].\nIn Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 we show the comparison of data\nand model calculations for Z=1 and Z=2 particles, respectively. The three studied systems are considered, for\nthe centrality bin M4. The integrated v1 values show\nsensitivity to both EoS and to MDI. As expected, the\nMDI influence the flow essentially in the vicinity of the\nprojectile spectator (y (0) > 0.8). This effect is more pronounced the lighter the system. All these sensitivities\nare enhanced for Z=2 particles. For Au+Au and Xe+CsI\nsystems, the SM parametrization is reproducing the data\nvery well, for both Z=1 and Z=2 particles. This may be\nthe result of a similar balance of thermal and collective\ncontributions in the model compared to the data. In fact,\nthe phase space populations of Z=1 and Z=2 particles\nare similar for model and data.\n10\n\n\fIntegrated v1\n\npointed out that the shape of the flow excitation function is drastically influenced by the method of imposing\nconstraints on the Fermi momenta [41]. The features\nof the model calculations presented above for 400A MeV\nshow the danger of deriving EoS-related conclusions from\nrapidity-integrated flow values (like pdir\nx ) unless a detailed description of the data is first achieved in a differential way. As realized early on [27], a soft EoS with\nMDI is producing similar magnitude in pdir\nas a hard\nx\nEoS without MDI.\n\n0.6\n\nAu+Au E=400 AMeV\n\n0.5\n\nall,xZ\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\nData\nM4\n\n0.1\n0\n\nC.

The centrality\nbins M4 and M3 are studied. In this case the sensitivity\nto EoS is reduced, as a consequence of a balance between\nmagnitude of flow and yield of composite particles in the\nmodel: hard EoS produces more flow, but less particles\nwith Z >1, while for soft EoS it is opposite. This behavior strongly underlines once more the necessity that\ntheoretical models appropriately describe the yields of\ncomposite particles. The conclusion on EoS is this time\nless evident, but the parametrizations without MDI are\nruled out once again, on the basis of their departure from\nthe data in the region of spectator rapidity. As expected,\nthis effect is more pronounced for the more peripheral\ncentrality bin M3.\nDespite the good agreement seen at the beam energy\nof 400A MeV, we found that in the IQMD model the\ndecrease of flow towards lower incident energies is much\nfaster than for data, leading to larger theoretical Ebal\ncompared to data (and to the behavior seen in Fig. 12).\nThis may be a result of deficiencies in incorporating MDI\nand in the treatment of fragment production.

For the HM case the\nstatistical errors of the model are plotted.\n\nIn Fig. 16 the measured differential directed flow for\nAu+Au collisions at incident energy of 400A MeV, M4\ncentrality, is compared to the IQMD results for all the\nfour parametrizations used above.

As\nfor the case of the integral flow, the SM parametrization\n11\n\n\fv1\n\nreproduces the experimental data quite well. Apparently\nthe model calculations deviate from the data at high pt\nin case of Z=1 particles, while the corresponding Z=2\nparticles are well explained. This deviation is more pronounced for larger rapidities. We have found earlier [60]\nthat a BUU model does not explain the DDF of protons\nin the spectator region at higher energies. The shape\nof the Z=1 DDF distributions are in case of the IQMD\nmodel strikingly similar to the ones of Z=2, while for the\ndata there are subtle differences between the two particle species (at this energy of 400A MeV as well as down\nto 90A MeV [48]). The model features may be the result that the nucleons (dominating the Z=1 sample) in\nthe models are all \"primordial\", which does not account\nfor the sequential decays of heavier fragments. The dynamics of the expansion and fragment formation may be\nresponsible for the differences, too.\n\n0.4\n\nXe+CsI\n\n0.3\n\nIQMD\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\nData\n\n0\n\nNi+Ni\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nTABLE III.

As in case of integrated values,\nas a result of different relative contribution of particles\nheavier than Z=1, the sensitivity to EoS is reduced for\nthis type of comparison.\n\nIn Table III we compare the experimental values of\nthe average normalized transverse momentum with the\nvalues from IQMD, for HM and SM cases. Particles with\nZ=1 and Z=2 for the two windows in rapidity studied in\nFig. 16 are compared. The data values have a systematic\nerror represented by the number in parenthesis as the\nerror on the last digit. The model reproduces reasonably\nwell the average transverse momenta for Z=1 particles,\nwhile it underestimates them for Z=2, for both windows\nof rapidity.\nWe mention that, recently, our experimental differential directed flow in Au+Au [48] was nicely reproduced by a BUU model wich includes an improved DiracBrueckner formalism [49]. In this case, for the densities\nexpected at 400A MeV, the EoS is soft, which is in agreement to our results.\nIn Fig. 17 we show the measured DDF for Xe+CsI and\nNi+Ni systems at 400A MeV, M4 centrality, in comparison to IQMD results, for Z=1 particles in two windows\nof rapidity. In case of Xe+CsI system the model calculations are at the same level of agreement with data as in\ncase of Au+Au: the SM parametrization is reproducing\nthe data, with clear deviations at high momenta. For the\nNi+Ni case even the HM parametrization underpredicts\nthe measured data. Most notably, as obvious particularly for Ni+Ni, the MDI have effects predominantly at\nlow pt , contrary to earlier BUU predictions (performed\nfor the asymmetric system Ar+Pb) [36].\n\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented experimental results on directed\nflow in Au+Au, Xe+CsI and Ni+Ni collisions at incident\nenergies from 90 to 400A MeV. General features of the\ndirected flow have been investigated using experimental\ndata, particularly the centrality and the system dependence. We have studied the rapidity dependence of the\nfirst Fourier coefficient, v1 , integrating over all transverse\nmomentum range. A special emphasis has been put on\nthe differential directed flow, namely the pt dependence\nof v1 . While for integrated values we presented a new way\nof looking at old (and generally known) dependences, the\nDDF results are reported for the first time for our energy\ndomain, both for the centrality and for the system size\ndependence. We have devoted special care to the corrections of the experimental data. The influence of the\nfinite granularity of the detector has been studied and\ncorrected for. The high accuracy of the final results is\n\n12\n\n\fv1\n\ntion of system size, and iii) fragment production. As a\nconsequence, none of the IQMD parametrizations studied here is able to consistently explain the whole set of\nexperimental data.\nThe importance of spectators acting as clocks for the\nexpansion is one particular argument to study collective\nflow in semi-central collisions at energies from a few hundred MeV to a few GeV per nucleon [4]. We have demonstrated that high precision experimental data allows us to\nstudy the many facets of the heavy-ion collisions. Other\nobservables, like v2 , should receive a comparable (and\nsimultaneous) attention too. Whether the nuclear equation of state can be extracted from such studies depends\nultimately on the ability of any type of microscopic transport model to reproduce the measured features.\n\n0.5\n\nall,xZ\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\nData\n\nM4\n\n0.1\n\ny(0)=0.5-0.7\n\n0\n0.6\n\n(0)\n\ny =0.7-0.9\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nIQMD\nHM\nH\nSM\nS\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nThis work has been supported in part by the German\nBMBF under contracts 06HD953, RUM-005-95/RUM99/010, POL-119-95, UNG-021-96 and RUS-676-98 and\nby the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under\nprojects 436 RUM-113/10/0, 436 RUS-113/143/2 and\n446 KOR-113/76/0.

The model calculations are the lines.\n\nbased as well on a good reaction plane resolution achieved\nwith the full coverage of the FOPI detector.\nWe have compared the experimental data with IQMD\ntransport model calculations, for both integral and differential v1 values. This comparison, performed for all the\nthree studied systems, shows a clear sensitivity of the\ndirected flow on the EoS parametrization in the model,\nespecially in case of particle-selected comparison. In this\ncase, for both integrated and differential directed flow\nat the incident energy of 400A MeV, we conclude that\na soft EoS with MDI is the only parametrization in the\nmodel that reproduces the data for Au and Xe systems.\nA clear discrepancy is seen for Ni system, which needs\nto be addressed separately. It may reflect the increasing\nimportance played by the nuclear surface for lighter systems. We consider our present results as a case study on\nthe sensitivities in determination of EoS and MDI from\ndirected flow comparisons. We emphasized the necessity\nof the present kind of differential comparison prior to\nmore global quantities. We have shown that the combination of rapidity and transverse momentum analysis of\n(differential) directed flow can impose constraints on the\nmodel.
