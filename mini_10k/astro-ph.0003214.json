Here we apply an algebraic model of nonlinear acceleration, combined with SNR evolution, to\nmodel the radio and X-ray continuum of Kepler's SNR.\nProceedings of the ACE-2000 Symposium on The Acceleration and Transport of Energetic Particles Observed in the\nHeliosphere, January 5 - 8, 2000, Indian Wells, CA\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMore than twenty years of spacecraft observations in\nthe heliosphere have proven that collisionless shocks can\naccelerate particles with high efficiency, i.e., 10-50% of\nthe ram energy can go into superthermal particles (e.g.,\nEichler [17]; Gosling et al. [21]; Ellison et al. [19]; Terasawa et al. [30]). Energetic particles exist throughout the\nuniverse and shocks are commonly associated with them,\nconfirming that shock acceleration is important beyond\nthe heliosphere as well. In fact, shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the main source of Galactic cosmic rays, and these shocks are expected to be much\nstronger than those in the heliosphere and can only be\nmore efficient and nonlinear.\nThe conjecture that collisionless shocks are efficient\naccelerators is strengthened by results from plasma simulations, which show efficient shock acceleration consistent with spacecraft observations (e.g., Scholer, Trattner,\n& Kucharek [29]; Giacalone et al. [20]), and other indirect evidence comes from radio emission from SNRs (see\nReynolds & Ellison [27]) and equipartition arguments in\nAGNs and \u03b3-ray bursts (see Blandford & Eichler [6] for\nan early review). There is also clear evidence that shocks\ncan produce strong self-generated turbulence. This has\nlong been seen in heliospheric shocks (e.g., Lee [24, 25];\nKennel et al. [23]; Baring et al. [3]) and there is evidence\nthat it occurs at SNRs as well (i.e., Achterberg, Blandford, & Reynolds [1]).\n\nWhile the importance of nonlinear (NL) shock acceleration is evident, NL solutions to diffusive shock acceleration are complicated and results are often unwieldy and\ndifficult to use for astrophysical applications. Therefore,\nwe have developed a simple, algebraic model of diffusive shock acceleration, based on more complete studies,\nwhich includes the essential nonlinear effects (Berezhko\n& Ellison [4]; Ellison, Berezhko, & Baring [18]). This\ntechnique is computationally fast and easy-to-use, yet\nincludes (i) the modification of particle spectra when\nthe backpressure from energetic ions smooths the shock\nstructure, and (ii) the influences on the shock dynamics\nwhen the magnetic turbulence is strongly amplified by\nwave-particle interactions.\nThe complications of NL shock acceleration and the\nmany parameters required to characterize it are offset\nsomewhat by the fact that the entire particle distribution\nfunction, from thermal to the highest energies, is interconnected and must be accounted for self-consistently\nwith a nonthermal tail connecting the quasi-thermal population to the energetic one. Because energy is conserved,\na change in the production efficiency of the highest energy particles must impact the thermal properties of the\nshock heated gas and vice versa. If more energy goes into\nrelativistic particles, less is available to heat the gas. In\ncontrast, the power laws assumed by test-particle models\nhave no connection with the thermal gas, energy conservation does not constrain the normalization of the power\nlaw, and the spectral index can be changed with no feedback on the thermal plasma. Furthermore, there is a direct\n\n\flinkage between protons and electrons (which produce\nmost of the photon emission associated with shocked gas)\nin nonlinear models, so the entire emission from radio to\ngamma-rays, plus cosmic-ray observations, can, in principle, be used to constrain the models.\nHere we describe some of the nonlinear features expected to occur in young SNRs and investigate some\nimplications of efficient cosmic-ray production on the\nbroad-band continuum from Kepler's SNR. We refer to\nBerezhko & Ellison [4] and Ellison, Berezhko, & Baring\n[18] for details of the NL shock model and its application to particle and photon production in SNRs. Work on\nthe NL X-ray line emission from Kepler is in progress,\ni.e., Decourchelle, Ellison, & Ballet [12]. Previous testparticle calculations of the X-ray emission from Kepler\nhave been reported by Borkowski, Sarazin, & Blondin\n[7], who used a two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation, and by Rothenflug et al. [28], who investigated\nthe emission from the reverse shock. The work of Decourchelle & Ballet [11] is mentioned below.\n\nNONLINEAR SHOCK ACCELERATION\nThe nonlinear effects in shock acceleration are of two\nbasic kinds: (i) the self-generation of magnetic turbulence\nby accelerated particles and (ii) the modification (i.e.,\nsmoothing) of the shock structure by the backpressure of\naccelerated particles. Briefly, (i) occurs when counterstreaming accelerated particles produce turbulence in the\nupstream magnetic field which amplifies as it is convected\nthrough the shock. This amplified turbulence results in\nstronger scattering of the particles, and hence to more acceleration, quickly leading to saturated turbulence levels\nnear \u03b4B/B \u223c 1 in strong shocks. The wave-particle interactions produce heating in the shock precursor which\nmay be observable. Effect (ii) results in the overall compression ratio, rtot , being an ever increasing function of\nMach number (as if the effective ratio of specific heats\n\u03b3eff \u2192 1 and analogous to radiative shocks), i.e.,\n3/4\n\nrtot \u2243 1.3 MS0\n\nif\n\n2\nMS0\n> MA0 ,\n\n(1)\n\n3/8\n\n(2)\n\nFIGURE 1. Comparison of nonlinear and test-particle shock\nresults as a function of upstream sonic Mach number. The top\ntwo panels show that, at MS0 > 100, the downstream density\ncan be > 5 times larger and the shocked temperature > 10 times\nsmaller if the acceleration is NL. The bottom panel shows that\nfor MS0 > 100 and \u03b7inj,p = 10\u22123 , more than 70% of the pressure\nin the shocked gas ends up in relativistic particles in NL shock\nacceleration. These results depend on parameters other than\nMS0 , and in particular are a strong function of \u03b7inj,p , particularly\nat high MS0 . The heavy-weight curves are for \u03b7inj,p = 10\u22123 and\nthe light-weight curves are for \u03b7inj,p = 10\u22124 .\n\nor by\nrtot \u2243 1.5 MA0\n\nin the opposite case (MS0 is the sonic and MA0 is the\nAlfv\u00e9n Mach number). Simultaneously, shock smoothing causes the viscous subshock to be weak (rsub \u226a rtot )\nand the temperature of the shocked gas to drop below the\ntest-particle value.\nThere are many parameters associated with NL shock\nacceleration (see Ellison, Berezhko, & Baring [18] for a\nlisting), but the most important ones that determine the\nsolution are the Mach numbers (i.e., the shock speed,\npre-shock density, and magnetic field) and the injection\n\nefficiency, \u03b7inj,p (i.e., the fraction of total protons which\nend up with superthermal energies). As described in\nBerezhko & Ellison ([4]), we use Alfv\u00e9n heating in the\nprecursor which reduces the efficiency compared to adiabatic heating. Significantly, parameters typical of young\nSNRs should result in NL acceleration.\nFigure 1 shows a comparison between test-particle\n(dashed lines) and nonlinear results as a function of sonic\nMach number, MS0 . As illustrated in the top panel, the\noverall compression ratio, rtot , is generally > 4 and can\n\n\fincrease without limit in the NL case for \u03b7inj,p = 10\u22123.\nSimultaneously, the subshock compression ratio, rsub , is\nless than 4 (typically rsub \u223c 3). The overall compression\ndetermines the shocked density, while the subshock is\nmainly responsible for heating the gas. Thus, the shocked\ngas will be cooler (middle panel) and denser if the acceleration is NL compared to a test-particle (TP) case. This\nis an important consideration for X-ray line models. The\nparticle spectrum at the highest energies is determined by\nrtot , and thus will be flatter than in a TP shock. However, the spectral shape at lower energies depends on rsub ,\nindicating that the particle spectrum will go from being\nsteeper than the TP prediction at low energies to flatter at\nthe highest energies, this is the so-called concave signature of NL shock acceleration. The bottom panel shows\nthat a large fraction of the shocked pressure can end up in\nrelativistic particles (dotted line) for large MS0 . These results depend on the injection efficiency assumed and the\nturnover in rtot at large MS0 seen in the \u03b7inj,p = 10\u22124 example is a transition to a strong, unmodified shock (see\nBerezhko & Ellison [4] for a full discussion).\nIn Figure 2 we show the phase space distribution functions, f (p), for electrons (dashed line), protons (solid\nline), and helium (dotted line). The parameters used for\nthis forward shock are those discussed below for Kepler's SNR and given in Table 1. These particles produce photons from synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, inverseCompton, and pion-decay processes (see Baring et al.\n[2] for details) and these spectra are shown in Figure 3\nfor both the forward and reverse shocks. As discussed\nbelow, we have chosen parameters to cause the reverse\nshock to contribute substantially to the total X-ray emission, but this choice impacts the emission over the entire range from radio to gamma-rays. While the radio\nsynchrotron comes primarily from the reverse shock, the\nforward shock dominates emission at TeV energies with\na pion-decay component. Any changes in parameters to\naccommodate the X-ray observations must be consistent\nwith observational constraints in all other bands.\n\nFIGURE 2. Downstream phase space distribution functions, f ,\nversus momentum, p. We have multiplied f (p) by [p/(mp c)]4\nto flatten the spectra, and by [(mp c)3 /n p0 ] to make them dimensionless (n p0 is the upstream proton number density). The\nsolid line shows protons, the dotted line shows helium, and the\ndashed line shows electrons.\n\nAPPLICATION TO KEPLER'S SNR\nWe now apply our model to the radio and X-ray emission seen in Kepler's SNR. The X-ray emission shows the\npresence of lines and these have been interpreted, in models without acceleration (see Decourchelle & Petre [13];\nDecourchelle et al.. [14]), as coming from the ejecta material heated by the reverse shock. However, these previous models also required the presence of a power law\nphoton continuum, presumably coming from synchrotron\nemitting TeV electrons (e.g., Reynolds [26]).\nHere, we use the evolutionary model of Truelove &\nMcKee [31] to obtain the forward and reverse shock parameters at the \u223c 395 yr age of Kepler's SNR and, us-\n\nFIGURE 3. Photon spectra from the forward (FS) and reverse\nshocks (RS) obtained with parameters used to generate the spectra shown in Figure 2. Notice that emission in the X-ray band\n(1-100 keV) is totally bremsstrahlung for the FS but has a synchrotron component in the RS. Emission at gamma-ray energies\nis dominated by the FS, while the radio comes totally from the\nRS.\n\n\fing these shock parameters, calculate the NL particle and\nthen photon spectra. Figure 4 shows the synchrotron and\nbremsstrahlung emission from Figure 3 and indicates that\nwe are able to obtain a good fit to the data within the\nconstraint that the continuum emission from the reverse\nshock contribute substantially to the X-ray emission (our\nmodel only produces continuum which lies below any Xray emission lines). Since the forward and reverse shocks\nhave very different emission profiles (Figure 3), the ability to resolve the individual shocks in radio and X-rays\nwill be exceptionally important for constraining the models.\nWe note that the relation between the line and continuum emission is not straightforward and requires a\ndetailed calculation as is currently in progress, i.e., Decourchelle, Ellison, & Ballet [12]. This is particularly the\ncase in young SNRs because, while the lines and continuum both depend on the electronic temperature in the\nshocked gas, the lines also depend strongly on the ejecta\ncomposition and on the ionization state. The ionization\nstate can be strongly influenced by non-equilibrium effects and by the history of the shocked plasma. What can\nbe said, however, is that the presence of lines restricts the\nsynchrotron intensity to some level comparable to (with a\nfactor of 10 say) or below the bremsstrahlung continuum.\nAs mentioned above, NL shocks are extremely complicated with many (often poorly defined) parameters and\nour purpose in this preliminary work is only to give some\nindication of the issues involved when NL effects are considered. The basic point is that, if nonlinear cosmic-ray\nproduction occurs, the X-ray modeling cannot be done\nwithout considering emission in other bands, particularly\nradio and gamma-rays (if available). For Kepler we know\nthat strong lines are present, indicating that the thermal\ngas behind the reverse shock is contributing substantially\nto the emission. This strongly constrains the range of acceptable parameters. Previous TP models have also indicated that a continuum component is likely to be present.\nIf so, this is likely to be synchrotron from TeV electrons\nand must be consistent with the radio observations.\nThe parameters used to generate Figure 4 are given in\nTable 1. All terms in this Table are explained in Ellison,\nBerezhko, & Baring ([18]) but some additional explanation is required since we include here, for the first time, a\ncalculation of acceleration at the reverse shock. (i) The\nunshocked proton number density, n p0 , is arbitrarily chosen for the FS and determined for the RS with eqs. (20),\n(28), and (30) in Truelove & McKee [31]. (ii) The unshocked magnetic field, B0 , is arbitrarily chosen and the\nshocked field (which produces the synchrotron emission)\nis taken to be B2 = rtot B0 . We allow for an independent\nB0 for the reverse shock and, in fact, the only way the\nRS can contribute substantially to the X-ray emission is\nfor the RS B0 to be much larger (25 vs. 1.5 \u03bcG) than\n\nFIGURE 4.

The radio\ndata is from Reynolds & Ellison [27] and X-ray data is adapted\nfrom Decourchelle & Petre [13] (Decourchelle, private communication). We use a standard \u03bd F\u03bd representation and have suppressed the error bars on the X-ray points.\n\nthe FS B0 . (iii) The supernova energy, Esn , and ejecta\nmass, Mej , are standard values. (iv) We assume the same\nunshocked proton temperature, Tp0 = 104 K, for the FS\nand RS. The solutions are relatively insensitive to this parameter. (v) The shocked electron to proton temperature\nratio, Te2 /Tp2 , is a free parameter in the NL shock model\nand is set to 1 for both shocks. (vi) The injection efficiency, \u03b7inj,p , is an important model parameter determining the overall acceleration efficiency. Values much larger\nthan \u03b7inj,p = 2\u00d710\u22124 tend to produce strong nonthermal\ntails on the bremsstrahlung emission which may be inconsistent with the observations. Values much smaller than\n2\u00d710\u22124 yield test-particle solutions with typical temperatures higher than allowed by the X-ray observations. We\nnote that adjustments in \u03b7inj,p produce extremely large\nmodifications in the TeV results and can be highly constrained with gamma-ray observations. (vii) The electron to proton ratio at relativistic energies, (e/p)rel , is an\narbitrary parameter in the simple model but is expected\nto be between 0.01 and 0.05 if (e/p)rel in galactic cosmic rays is typical of that produced by the strong shocks\nin young SNRs. This factor is very important for determining the pion-decay contribution to TeV gamma-rays.\nFurthermore, lowering (e/p)rel lowers the overall emission in the radio to X-ray band but increases the relative\ncontribution of thermal to synchrotron photons in the Xray band. A firm determination of the synchrotron contribution to X-rays, combined with a gamma-ray detection,\nwill help determine (e/p)rel , one of the most important\n\n\funknown parameters in shock acceleration. (viii) The\nmaximum energy cosmic rays obtain in the NL model\ndepends on the scattering mean free path, \u03bb, which is assumed to be,\n\u0001\u03b1\n(3)\n\u03bb = \u03b7mfp rg,max rg /rg,max ,\nwhere \u03b7mfp is taken to be independent of particle momentum (Baring et al. [2], use the notation \u03b7), rg = p/(qB) is\nthe gyroradius in SI units, rg,max is the gyroradius at the\nmaximum momentum, pmax , and \u03b1 is a constant parameter (\u03b1 = 1 = \u03b7mfp is roughly the Bohm limit). Here we\nonly consider \u03b1 = 1. A fairly large value of \u03b7mfp = 15\n(giving a maximum cosmic-ray energy well below that\nobtained in the Bohm limit) is required to avoid having the X-ray emission totally dominated by synchrotron\nfrom TeV electrons. (ix) We assume that the initial density profile in the ejecta has a power law density distribution, \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212n , with n = 9, and that the unshocked ISM is\nuniform.\nThe output values are also given in Table 1. Of these,\nVsk and Rsk are taken directly from the Truelove & McKee\n[31]) solution. Once these are obtained, the Mach numbers are determined (given the relevant input parameters),\nand then the NL shock model determines the compression ratios, temperatures, and particle spectra. Using the\nparticle spectra, the continuum emission is calculated. It\nis important to notice that the shocks are highly efficient\nand NL. They yield total compression ratios > 4, shocked\ntemperatures nearly 10 times lower than the corresponding test-particle shocks, and place the majority of the total energy flux, \u03b5rel , into relativistic particles (mainly protons), yielding \u03b3eff 's less than 5/3.\nFinally, our model includes a rough estimate of the\nemission volume\nVemis \u2248 (4\u03c0/3) R3sk/rtot ,\n\n(4)\n\nas described in Ellison, Berezhko, & Baring [18]. This\nvolume is considerably less than the total remnant volume. If we assume a distance to Kepler of Dsnr = 5\nkpc (e.g., Decourchelle & Ballet [11]), the normalization\ngiven by eq. (4), and shown in the Table, matches the observations.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nX-ray line and continuum emission contains a vast\namount of information on supernova (SN) ejecta elemental composition, ISM density and elemental composition,\nthe SN explosion energy, and the mass of ejecta. In\naddition to heating the plasma, the forward and reverse\nshocks accelerate some fraction of the shocked material\nto cosmic-ray energies and this acceleration is believed\nto be quite efficient, removing energy from the thermal\n\nTable 1.

Despite the expected efficiency of shock acceleration, virtually all current X-ray line models assume that the shocks that heat\nthe gas do not place a significant fraction of their energy in cosmic rays (exceptions to this are Chevalier [10]\nand Dorfi [15]). Here, we investigated the broad-band\ncontinuum emission expected in Kepler's SNR from efficient shock acceleration, by coupling self-similar hydrodynamics (Chevalier [10]; Truelove & McKee [31]) with\nnonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (e.g., Berezhko,\nKsenofontov, & Petukhov [5]). We were able to show\nthat the radio and X-ray continuum can be fit with reasonable parameters in a way that allows the reverse shock to\n\n\fcontribute substantially to the total X-ray emission. This\nconstraint is required since X-ray line models of Kepler\n(e.g., Decourchelle & Petre [13]) require emission from\nthe shock-heated, metal-rich ejecta material.\nThis preliminary calculation is not fully self-consistent\nfor several reasons. Most importantly, we use self-similar\nresults (i.e., Truelove & McKee [31]) to model the SNR\nevolution. These solutions neglect the effects of energetic\nparticle escape from the FS and assume that the ratio of\ncosmic-ray pressure to total pressure at the shock front is\na constant. They also assume that \u03b3eff = 5/3. As indicated\nin the bottom panel of Figure 1, the total shocked pressure\ndoesn't differ much with or without cosmic-ray production and we have demonstrated (i.e., Decourchelle, Ellison, & Ballet [12]) that NL shock results do not change\ndramatically over most of the age of Kepler for typical\nvalues of the injection parameter, \u03b7inj,p > 10\u22124 . However for lower \u03b7inj,p , the nonlinear solutions can have testparticle, unmodified solutions at very high sonic Mach\nnumbers with a rapid transition to the NL solution as the\nMach number drops (see Fig. 1 and Berezhko & Ellison\n[4] for a detailed discussion). The self-similar solutions\nwe use are still approximate, however, because we have\nnot yet modified them for the change in \u03b3eff that results\nwhen a substantial fraction of the shocked pressure is in\ncosmic rays. We also neglect cosmic-ray diffusion and\nassume they are spatially coupled to the gas \u2013 an excellent approximation for all but the highest energy particles.\nHowever, the highest energy electrons produce the X-ray\nsynchrotron photons so there may be differences that are\nnot modeled in the emission volumes and other important\nparameters between the radio and X-ray bands. Finally,\nwe have not included absorption in our models which is\nprobably not important for the Kepler radio observations,\nbut will be required to model the low energy X-rays.1\nBesides providing a more self-consistent model of\nphoton production, predictions from NL shock models\nprovide a test of the fundamental assumption that SNRs\nare the primary source of galactic cosmic-ray ions. If\nthis is so, the acceleration is almost certainly nonlinear\nsince 5-30% of the total ejecta kinetic energy is required\nto replenish cosmic rays as they escape from the galaxy.\nSince shocks put more energy into accelerated ions than\nelectrons, nonlinear effects seen in X-ray emission will\nbe evidence for the efficient shock acceleration of ions as\nwell as electrons. X-ray observations potentially provide\nin situ information on cosmic-ray ion production, complementing observations of pion-decay \u03b3-rays in this regard. Any inference of nonthermal tails on electron dis-\n\ntributions in X-ray observations will provide information\non electron injection, the least well understood aspect\nof shock acceleration. Such in situ information on high\nMach number shocks is available nowhere else.\nOur modeling of Kepler's SNR suggests that typical\nsource parameters produce large nonlinear effects in the\nbroad-band spectrum and suggest that the test-particle approximations that are almost universally used are inadequate for SNRs as young as this. Besides the differences discussed above, one might expect that the growth\nrate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability will be greater in a\ncosmic-ray modified shock because of the larger spatial\ngradients of density, pressure, etc. Furthermore, the high\ncompression ratios result in a considerably thinner region\nbetween the forward and reverse shocks than predicted in\nthe TP case (Decourchelle, Ellison, & Ballet [12]). This\nplaces the contact discontinuity closer to the shock and\nmay make it easier for the Rayleigh-Taylor \"fingers\" to\ndistort or overtake the FS, a situation that appears difficult with normal TP parameters (Chevalier, Blondin, &\nEmmering [9]; Chevalier & Blondin [8]). Another important difference concerns electron heating and equilibration. The higher densities in the NL models mean\nthat electron heating is much more efficient than in TP\nshocks. Our initial calculations [12] suggest that it may\nbe possible to obtain full equipartition between electrons\nand ions, at least for high values of \u03b7inj,p , in the shocked\nejecta.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI wish to thank the organizers of the ACE-2000 Symposium for putting on a very useful and enjoyable meeting and for providing support.
