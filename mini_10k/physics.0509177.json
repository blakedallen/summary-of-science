Our observational\nresults based on long term trends of SST reveal that the anomaly reached a record 0.8 \u00b0C\nin the Gulf of Mexico in August 2005 as compared to previous years and may have been\nresponsible for the intensification of the devastating Hurricane Katrina into a category 5\nhurricane that hit the Southern coast of United States severely impacting the low lying\ncity of New Orleans and the surrounding areas. In most intensifying storms, air-sea\ninteraction is the major contributing factor (5) and here we show how air-sea interactions\nmight have affected Katrina's rapid intensification in the Gulf.\nAir-sea interactions include role of latent heat flux (6), sensible heat flux and SST\ntowards the intensification and decay of hurricanes. Generally, this requires the SST to\nbe at least 26 \u00b0C for hurricanes to form, be maintained and intensify (7). Over warm\nwaters, latent heat releases moisten the lower troposphere, while sensible heat fluxes\nwarm the lower troposphere. Additionally, within the hurricane, there is a release of\nlatent heat due to water vapor cooling and condensing into cloud droplets. This causes\nheat energy to be converted from potential energy to kinetic energy thus producing a\n\n\fsecondary circulation within the hurricane. The overall effect is the feedback and\nintensification of the process.\nFigure 1A shows that the mean SST values were above ~30 \u00b0C with a discernible\nwarm patch of ~33 \u00b0C in the northwestern shelf adjacent to the state of Louisiana in\nAugust, 2005. The SST anomaly (SSTA) reached a record value of ~0.8 \u00b0C as compared\nto previous years (Fig. 1B) with a positively increasing trend. The northwestern shelf in\nthe upper Gulf can be identified as a localized warm area that might have provided\nadditional fuel to the hurricane as it entered the Gulf from the western side crossing\nsouthern Florida. Katrina was category 1 on August 25 and intensified to Category 2, 3,\n4 and finally 5 after entering the Gulf. Furthermore, daily variations of surface latent\nheat flux (SLHF) and sensible heat flux (SHF) values show significant increases during\nthe intensification period of the hurricane with large peak values of ~500 Wm-2 and ~70\nWm-2, respectively (Fig. 1C). We estimated that the heat contained in the abnormally\nelevated SST values of the Gulf is comparable to the energy in latent heat in the inner\nhurricane, ~ 1014 J.\nThese results suggest that the anomalous SST was the prominent factor causing the\nintensification of Katrina in the Gulf, although other associated parameters such as\nvertical wind shear of ambient flow and atmospheric stability were also important. The\nincreasing trend of SSTA from 2001 combined with the increased hurricane activities in\nrecent years suggest that the possibility of climate anomalies induced by global warming\nmay have played a vital role in the intensification of Katrina. Tracking anomalously\nwarm Gulf waters is important since if this trend continues in the years ahead, an\nincreased number of hurricanes like Katrina will continue striking the Gulf areas.\n\n\fReferences\n1.
