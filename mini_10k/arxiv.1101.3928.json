Introduction\nDespite more than 24 years of intensive research, the origin\nof high-temperature copper-oxide superconductivity (HTSC)\nhas not yet been well understood. HTSC can be observed\non a CuO2 plane when an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator\nis doped with mobile carriers. A strong relationship between\nantiferromagnetism (AFM) and superconductivity (SC) is believed to be the key to understanding the origin of remarkably high SC transition temperatures [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. As a matter of fact, site-selective 63 Cu-NMR studies on multilayered\ncuprates revealed that AFM uniformly coexists with SC in a\nsingle CuO2 plane [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]; Square-type inner CuO2 planes (IPs) are located so far from the charge reservoir layers (CRLs), in which the disorder is introduced by the\nchemical substitution, exhibiting homogeneous hole doping. In\nthe previous papers, the NMR investigations of five-layered\n(n=5) compounds [20, 22, 25] and four-layered (n=4) compounds [21, 23, 24] have revealed that the AFM quantum critical point (QCP) takes place around the hole densities pc \u223c 0.17\nand \u223c 0.15, respectively. These pc s are significantly larger than\npc \u223c 0.02 for La2\u2212x Sr x CuO4 (n=1:LSCO) [26] and pc \u223c 0.055\nfor YBa2 Cu3 O6+y (n=2:YBCO) [27]. Furthermore, pmax \u223c 0.22\ngiving rise to the maximum of T c for the n = 4 and n = 5 compounds is also larger than pmax \u223c 0.16 for the n=2 compounds.\nEmail address: kitaoka@mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp (Yoshio Kitaoka)\nPreprint submitted to **\n\nUpon doping with holes or electrons\u2212e.g., by replacing some\nof the out-of-plane atoms with different oxidation states\u2212 AFM\nis destroyed and the materials become superconductors at lower\ntemperatures. For example, in LSCO, La3+ is exchanged with\nSr2+ , which increases the planar CuO2 hole density. The situation with the in-plane hole density and distribution in other\nsuperconducting cuprates is even less clear. Indirect chemical\nmethods like solid solutions [28], semiempirical bond valence\nsums determined from structural bond lengths [29, 30, 31] or\nmethods based on the Fermi surface topology [32] are used to\ndetermine the hole density. To the best of our knowledge there\nare no direct physical measurements that can establish a phase\ndiagram in terms of the planar CuO2 hole density.\nUnder this situation, using NMR/NQR (nuclear quadrupole\nresonance) that can distinguish between the various atoms in\nthe unit cell, Zheng et al. had attempted to interpret the nuclear quadrupole interaction for planar Cu and O, in terms of\nthe local hole densities (see, e.g., Ref.[33] and references cited\nin it). This is indeed a sensible approach since the electric field\ngradient (EFG) at a nuclear site is very sensitive to changes\nin the local charge distribution, namely the planar Cu and O\nEFG's show a pronounced doping dependence. In these analyses, Zheng et al. used the experimental data available until 1995\nwith the help of atomic and cluster calculations to connect the\nhole densities to the EFG tensors for Cu and O. Furthermore, in\norder to estimate each hole density at IPs and pyramidal outer\nplanes (OPs) in multilayered compounds, we have used an empirical relationship between the spin component in Knight shift\nJanuary 25, 2017\n\n\fFigure 1: (Color online) Temperature dependence of Ksab for (a):Hg-1245(UD)#2 (T c =82K) [25], (b):Hg-1245(UD)#3 (T c =92K) [25], (c):Hg-1245(OPT)#1\n(T c =108K) [36], (d):Hg-1245(OPT)#2 (T c =110K) [22], (e):Tl-1245(OVD) (T c =100K) [22, 36], and (f):Cu-1245(OVD) (T c =90K) [37]. The hole density p for\nIPs and OPs is independently estimated using the renewed relationship of p versus Ks (RT), p =0.502Ks (RT)\u22120.014 [35] (see the text). Layer-dependent physical\nproperties are summarized in lower panels.\n\nK s (RT) at room temperature and the planar CuO2 hole density\n(p) determined with NMR/NQR.\n\n2. High-T c cuprates\n2.1. NMR results on five-layered (n=5) compounds\nFig. 1 shows temperature (T ) dependence of the spin component of Knight shift K sab (T ) (\u22a5 the c-axis) for n=5 compounds such as (a) Hg-1245(UD)#2 (T c =82K) [25], (b) Hg1245(UD)#3 (T c =92K) [25], (c) Hg-1245(OPT)#1 (T c =108K)\n[36], (d) Hg-1245(OPT)#2 (T c =110K) [22], (e) Tl-1245(OVD)\n(T c =100K) [22, 36], and (f) Cu-1245(OVD) (T c =90K) [37].\nK s (RT) at room temperature is proportional to the planar CuO2\nhole density p [33, 37]. Here, p for IPs and OPs is independently estimated using the renewed relationship of p versus\nK s (RT), p=0.502K s(RT)\u22120.014 [35].\nIn the T dependence of K sab (T )(OP), an unusual upturn\nwas observed below temperatures marked by up-arrows in\nFigs.1(a)-(e), below which the linewidth of 63 Cu-NMR spectra at OPs steeply increases. Note that this upturn in K sab (T ) at\nOPs was associated with an onset of AFM order at IPs, which\nwas also corroborated by a critical enhancement of 1/T 1 in the\nprevious studies on the other Hg-1245 compounds [22, 36].\nAs a result of reduction of hole densities, it was demonstrated\nthat the N\u00e9el temperature T N at IPs increases from T N =45 K\nfor (e) Tl-1245(OVD) (T c =100 K) [22, 36] to T N =150 K for\n(a) Hg-1245(UD)#2 (T c =82 K) [25]. Layer-dependent physical\nproperties are summarized in lower panels of Figs 1(a-f).\nSpontaneous AFM moments MAFM (IP) at IPs and OPs for the\nn=5 compounds were determined with the zero-field Cu-NMR\n\nMeanwhile, Hasse et al. [34] performed an almost model\nindependent analysis to relate the hole densities to the EFG\ntensors without relying on calculations and with the extensive experimental data until 2004 including those for the parent compounds of LSCO and YBCO. On the basis of this\nmore precise analysis to relate the hole densities to the EFG\ntensors than before [33], Shimizu et al. [35], have constructed a phase diagram of the n=2 apical-fluorine compounds\nBa2 CaCu2 O4 (F,O)2 (0212F) using a renewed empirical relationship of K s (RT) versus p. Remarkably, thus obtained phase diagram has coincided with the well established ones for the n=2\nYBCO and Bi2 Ba2 CaCu2 O8+y (Bi2212), exhibiting the maximum of T c at pmax \u223c 0.16. Thus, the universal phase diagram\nhas been established on the n=2 compounds independent of\nthe methods to estimate the hole densities. Motivated by this\nfact, in the first part of the paper, we reexamine the phase diagrams of AFM and SC in multilayered compounds reported\nextensively in the literatures [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\nIn the second part, we review extensive NMR studies on\nelectron-doped iron-oxypnictides La1111 compounds in order\nto shed light on novel normal-state properties and their relevance with unique SC characteristics and address remarkable\ndifferences from those in HTSC.\n2\n\n\fat 1.5 K. This is because an internal field (Hint ) is induced by\nMAFM (IP) at the Cu sites in IPs and OPs. MAFM (IP) is evaluated by using the relation Hint (IP)=|Ahf (IP)|MAFM (IP) with the\nhyperfine coupling constant Ahf (IP)=\u221220.7 T/\u03bcB [36]. The details are referred to the literatures [22, 25, 36]. The values of\nMAFM (IP) ranging in 0.04\u22120.20\u03bcB are significantly reduced by\nthe mobile holes from 0.5\u22120.7\u03bcB in undoped cuprates [39, 40].\nThis is consistent with the conclusion of neutron diffraction\nmeasurement on (a) Hg-1245(UD)#2 (T c =82 K) [25]; their\nmagnetic moments were suggested to be less than 0.3\u03bcB if any,\nsince a Bragg intensity, that enables to estimate MAFM , was\nnot apparent [41]. The NMR outcome on (a) Hg-1245(UD)#2\n(T c =82 K) ensures that the SC with T c =82 K uniformly coexists with the AFM order of MAFM (OP)\u223c 0.05\u03bcB at OPs [25].\nThis result convinces along with the previously reported ones\nthat the uniform coexistence of AFM and SC is a general event\nfor homogeneously underdoped CuO2 plane. Coexisting state\nof AFM and SC order are known in multi-band materials where\nthe AFM order occurs in localized d- and f -bands and the SC\norder in s- and p-bands. However, HTSC is characterized by\nonly a single electron fluid composing of Cu-O hybridized electrons. In such case, one may expect competition rather than coexistence between the two types of orders, but it is worth noting\nthat the T c of the coexisting phase is relatively high (T c \u223c 82\nK), revealing the close relationship between AFM order and SC\norder.\n2.2. Phase diagram of CuO2 plane\nIn Figs. 2(a)-(d), we present the phase diagrams of AFM\nand SC for (a) the n=1 LSCO, (b) the n=2 [35] and (c) the\nn=4 apical fluorine systems [21, 23, 24, 38], and (d) the n=5\ncompounds [22, 25]. In these phase diagrams, T N and T c\nare plotted as the function of p. Here the solid and empty\nsquares correspond to the respective data for IPs and OPs. It\nshould be noted that the phase diagram of the n=2 apical fluorine compounds does not reveal an AFM order [35]. This\nphase diagram resembles the well-established phase diagram of\nYBCO [27] in which AFM order totally collapses at pc \u223c 0.055.\nHowever, an AFM order takes place for the n=4 and 5 compounds [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 38]. It is noteworthy that pc at\nwhich AFM order collapses increases from pc =0.10 to 0.12 as\nn increases from 4 \u221a\nto 5. This result suggests that interlayers\nmagnetic coupling Jc Jout (n) becomes stronger with increasing n, which stabilizes the AFM order. Here, Jc is magnetic\ncoupling between interunit cells, which is independent of n, but\nJout (n) is magnetic coupling between intraunit cells, which increases with n. The characteristic features are summarized as;\n(1) the respective pc \u223c 0.10 and 0.12 for the n=4 and 5 compounds are significantly smaller than pc \u223c 0.15 and 0.17 which\nwere estimated in the previous papers [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 38].\nThis is because the previous analysis had overestimated p using\nthe experimental data available data until 1995 with the help of\natomic and cluster calculations to connect the hole densities to\nthe EFG tensors for Cu and O. (2) The maximum of T c for each\ncompound takes place universally around pmax \u223c 0.16. It is\nnoteworthy that the highest T c happens for the n=3 compound\nas expected.\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) The phase diagrams of AFM and SC for (a) the n=1\nLSCO, (b) the n=2 and (c) the n=4 apical fluorine systems [21, 23, 24, 38],\nand (d) the n=5 compounds [22, 25]. In these phase diagrams, T N and T c are\nplotted as the function of p. Here the solid and empty squares correspond to the\nrespective data for IPs and OPs.\n\n2.3. The T =0 phase diagram of AFM and superexchange interaction with doping\nFig. 3(a) shows a plot of the MAFM at T =1.5 K versus p [21,\n22, 23, 24, 25, 38], where the datum at p=0 for a Mott insulator\nis cited from the infinite-layered (n = \u221e) AFM-Mott insulator Ca0.85 Sr0.15 CuO2 with T N =537 K and MAFM =0.51\u03bcB [40].\nThe phase diagram of MAFM versus p presented here is totally consistent with the T =0 phase diagrams in a single CuO2\nplane which were theoretically addressed thus far in terms of\neither the t-J model [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19], or\nthe Hubburd model in a strong correlation regime [16, 17]. A\ncritical hole density pc at MAFM =0 taking place in the range\n0.10< pc <0.12 is in quantitative agreement with the calculations. Fig. 3(b), which shows a plot of T N versus MAFM ,\nhelps us to gain further insight into the p dependence of inplane exchange interaction Jin (p). In this figure, data are\npresented with respect to Ca0.85 Sr0.15 CuO2 having n = \u221e\nfor p=0 [40], the n=4 compound [24], and the n=5 compound [22, 25]. On the basis of the mean-field approximation\n3\n\n\ffor hole-doped AFM CuO2 planes than for undoped AFM-Mott\ninsulators. Mean-field theories of HTSC used to consider the\nHeisenberg superexchange interaction Jin as the source of an instantaneous attraction that led to pairing in a d-wave state [42].\nThe present outcomes may support such a scenario experimentally as far as the underdoped region is concerned, where AFM\nand SC uniformly coexist in a CuO2 plane.\n2.4. Summary on high-T c cuprates\nThe site-selective NMR studies on multilayered compounds\nhas led us to the following remarkable conclusions based on\nthe more precise evaluation of local hole density (p) [34] than\nbefore [33]:\n1. The T =0 phase diagram of AFM which is experimentally\ndetermined in Fig. 3(a) is in quantitative agreement with\nthe T =0 phase diagrams in terms of either the t-J model [1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19], or the\nHubburd model in the strong correlation regime [16, 17].\n2. T N increases as the intraunit cell magnetic coupling Jout (n)\nincreases with increasing n.\n3. The in-plane exchange interaction Jin (p) for the n = 4\nand 5 compounds is larger than Jin (\u221e) \u223c 1300 K for the\ninfinite-layered AFM-Mott insulator Ca0.85 Sr0.15 CuO2 .\nWhile noting that T c exhibits the maximum at pmax \u223c 0.16 close\nto pc \u223c 0.11 at the AFM-QCP regardless of n, the results presented here demonstrate that both AFM and SC are mediated\nby AFM interaction, which also acts the glue for the Cooper\npairs [42] and hence makes T c of HTSC very high. It is highlighted that the on-site Coulomb repulsive interaction is almost\nunchanged with doping, being almost the same as in AFMMott insulators. Further theoretical study is desired to address\nwhether Jin (p) becomes larger than for AFM-Mott insulators\neven though mobile holes are doped.\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) (a) Plot of MAFM at T =1.5 K versus p [22, 24, 40].\npc at MAFM =0 is around \u223c 0.11. (b) Plot of T N versus MAFM [21, 23, 24,\n2\n38, 22, 25, 40]. The broken curve shows T N \u221d MAFM\nwith T N =537 K at\nMAFM =0.51\u03bc B in Ca0.85 Sr0.15 CuO2 [40] where n = \u221e. The arrow points to\nMAFM \u223c 0.18\u03bc B .\n\n3. NMR studies on electron-doped iron-oxypnictides\nA new class of SC compounds including iron element has\nbeen discovered [43]. In all the cases of this class, Fe-3d conduction electrons are likely to form Cooper pairs and responsible for SC. However, the mechanism of SC is not well understood and is under extensive debates. In the family with\nZrCuSiAs-type structure (called 1111 hereafter), SmFeAs(O,F)\nhas shown the highest SC critical temperature T c =56K [44]\nwhen fluorine is substituted for 20% of oxygen as electron doping, while BaFe2 As2 with ThCr2 Si2 -type structure (called 122)\nhas indicated the highest T c =38 K, when potassium is substituted for 40% of Ba as hole doping [45]. It is not yet addressed\nwhy T c is highest in the Ln1111 system. Recently, it has been\nreported that T c can be increased by either a Y or a H substitution in the La1111 system without replacing magnetic rareearth elements [46, 47, 48], in which the angle \u03b1 of As-Fe-As\nbonding and the a-axis length approach those of the Nd1111\nsystem with the highest T c to date [49, 46, 50]. There is a\nway to address the intimate correlation between the evolution\nof electronic state and the local structure of the FeAs4 tetrahedron.\n\n2\nof localized spins, we assume that T N \u221d MAFM\n, and Jout (\u221e)\nand Jin (\u221e) for Ca0.85 Sr0.15 CuO2 stay constant regardless of p.\nUsing T N =537 K at MAFM =0.51 \u03bcB for Ca0.85 Sr0.15 CuO2 , a\n2\ngraph of T N \u221d MAFM\nis plotted, which is indicated by the\nbroken curve in Fig. 3(b). First, we notice that even though\nMAFM \u223c 0.18 \u03bcB remains constant (shown by an arrow in\nFig. 3(b)), T N (n) increases due to the increase in Jout (n) as n increases from 4 to 5, namely, Jout (4) < Jout (5). Although Jc and\nJout (n) values for n=4 and 5 are always smaller\n\u221a than Jout (\u221e)\n2\nin Ca0.85 Sr0.15 CuO2 , T N (n)\u223cMAFM\n(p)[Jin (p) Jc Jout (n)]1/2 are\n2\nlarger than T N (\u221e)\u223cMAFM\n(p)[Jin (\u221e)Jout (\u221e)]1/2 with T N =537\nK at MAFM =0.51\u03bcB and p=0 (see the broken curve in\nFig. 3(b)); we also obtain an unexpected relation, i.e., Jin (p) >\nJin (\u221e) \u223c 1300 K. The two experimental relationships\u2212the plot\nof MAFM versus p shown in Fig. 3(a) and the plot of T N versus MAFM shown in Fig. 3(b)\u2212 suggest that the AFM ground\nstate in the homogeneously\nhole-doped CuO2 layers is deter\u221a\nmined by p, Jc Jout (n) and Jin (n, p), which is larger than\nJin (\u221e) \u223c 1300 K. It is surprising that Jin (p) becomes larger\n\n4\n\n\fHere, we review on normal-state and SC characteristics\non La1111 compounds through extensive NMR measurements [51]. We focus on evolutions of the electronic state\nderived by Y- and H-substitution in the La1111 compounds\nand address why T c s in these compounds are enhanced. The\nsubstitutions of yttrium (Y) and hydrogen (H) into optimallydoped LaFeAsO1\u2212y (La1111(OPT)) increase T c =28 K to\nT c =34 K for La0.8 Y0.2 FeAsO1\u2212y (La0.8 Y0.2 1111) and T c =32 K\nLaFeAsO1\u2212y H x (La1111(H)), respectively [46, 47, 48].\nIn the normal state, the measurements of nuclear spinrelaxation rate 1/T 1 [51] revealed that the electron doping level\nin La0.8 Y0.2 1111 is close to that of La1111(OPT) where 1/T 1 T\ndecreases upon cooling without the development of AFM spin\nfluctuations [52, 53, 54], confirming that the Y3+ substitution\nfor La3+ does not change the doping level. As a result, the reason that T c increases in La0.8 Y0.2 1111 is not due to the change in\nits doping level, but because the structural parameters, such as\nthe bond angle \u03b1 of the FeAs4 tetrahedron and the a-axis length,\napproach each optimum value. By contrast, in La1111(H),\nthe (1/T 1 T ) is rather comparable with that for the underdoped\nLaFeAsO0.93 F0.07 (T c = 22.5 K) where 1/T 1 T stays constantly\nupon cooling without the development of AFM spin fluctuations as well [55]. These results imply that the La1111(H) is in\nan underdoped regime.\n\n0\n\n10\n\namong Fe-based new superconductors. These results contrast\nwith the behavior of 1/T 1 \u223c T 3 observed commonly in high-T c\ncuprates which are the d-wave superconductor with line-node\ngap.\nMeanwhile, it was shown in the literature [56] that the relaxation behaviors of both the T 3 in La1111(OPT) [52, 57] and\nthe T 5 in Ba0.6 K0.4 Fe2 As2 (BaK122) [56] are consistently reproduced in terms of the multiple fully-gapped s\u00b1 -wave model.\nThis model is also applicable for understanding the SC characteristics of La0.8 Y0.2 1111 and La1111(H) as follows. In\nmodel A, respective Fermi surfaces (FS1 and FS2) have an\nisotropic gap and an anisotropic gap denoted as \u2206FS 1 = \u22060\nand \u2206FS 2 (\u03c6) = (\u22060 + \u2206min )/2 + (\u22060 \u2212 \u2206min ) cos 2\u03c6/2 [57].\nIn model B, both Fermi surfaces have the isotropic gaps as\n\u2206FS 1 = \u2206L and \u2206FS 2 = \u2206S . According to the model A(B) in\nthe literature [57, 56], a fraction of the density of states (DOS)\nat FS1 is taken as NFS 1 /(NFS 1 + NFS 2 )=0.4 (0.7) and \u2206min =\n0.25 \u22060 (\u2206S /\u2206L =0.35). Furthermore, the coherence factor is\nneglected on the assumption that the interband scattering between the sign reversal gaps becomes dominant for the relaxation process. In fact, the T dependence of 57 (T 1 (T c )/T 1 ) of\nLa0.8 Y0.2 1111 is consistently reproduced using model B with\nthe parameters 2\u2206L /kB T c = 6.9(\u2206S /\u2206L =0.35) and a smearing\nfactor \u03b7 = 0.04\u2206L , as is shown by the solid line in Fig. 4. Here,\nthe smearing factor (\u03b7/\u2206L ) reflects a damping effect of quasiparticles due to impurity scattering. Notably, 2\u2206L /kB T c = 6.9 in\nLa0.8 Y0.2 1111 is larger than the 4.4 in La1111(OPT), revealing\nthat the Y substitution into La1111 increases T c up to 34 K in\nassociation with a strong-coupling effect to mediate the Cooper\npairs. Despite the fact that Y substitution introduces some disorder as suggested by \u03b7 (see Table 1) in La0.8 Y0.2 1111 being\nlarger than in La1111(OPT), it is noteworthy that the strongcoupling effect enhances T c .\n\n57\n\nFe-NMR\n\n) / T\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n3\n\nT\n\n1\n\n( T\n\nc\n\n~T\n-2\n\n10\n\n~T\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nTable 1: Evolutions of SC gap (\u2206L ) and smearing factor (\u03b7) obtained from\nthe analyses of 57 Fe-(T 1 (T c )/T 1 ) for La0.8 Y0.2 1111 and La1111(H) assuming\nthe multiple fully-gapped s\u00b1 wave model, which was applied to BK122 and\nLa1111(OPT) [56](see text). Here \u2206L represents the larger gap in model B\nassuming two full gaps. The \u03b7 reflects a damping effect of quasiparticles due to\nimpurity scattering, so that the \u03b7/\u03b70 represents the disorder effect introduced by\nY or H substitutions, where \u03b70 is defined as that of La1111(OPT). The angle \u03b1\nof As-Fe-As bonding is evaluated from the a-axis length at room T and a fixed\nbond length of Fe-As \u223c 2.41\u00c5 [49].\n\n5\n\nBaK122\n\n(T =38K)\n\nLa\n\n(T =34K)\n\n0.8\n\nY\n\n0.2\n\nc\n\n1111\n\nc\n\nLa1111H\n\n(T =32K)\n\nLa1111(OPT)\n\n(T =28K)\n\n0.1\n\nc\n\nc\n\n1\n\nBaK122[45, 56]\n\nTc\n(K)\n38\n\nLa0.8 Y0.2 1111\n\n34\n\nLa1111(H)\n\n32\n\nLa1111(OPT)[56]\n\n28\n\nT / T\n\nc\n\nFigure 4: (color online) T dependence of 57 Fe-(T 1 (T c )/T 1 ) normalized at T c in\nthe SC state of La0.8 Y0.2 1111 and La1111(H), along with the results reported\nin the literature on BaK122 and La1111(OPT) [56].

As a result, the reason that T c increases in\nLa1111(H) may be closely related to the slight increase of the\nSC gap as well.\nIn the SC state, the measurements of 1/T 1 have revealed in\nterms of a multiple fully-gapped s\u00b1 -wave model that the SC\ngap and T c in La0.8Y0.21111 becomes larger than those in\nLa1111(OPT) without any change of doping level, and the T c\nin La1111H increases even though the carrier density is decreased and some disorder is significantly introduced. As a consequence, it is highlighted that the reason that T c is increased in\nboth compounds is due to neither the change in doping level\nnor the development of AFM spin fluctuations, but because the\nstructural parameters approach each optimum value to increase\nT c for the bond angle \u03b1 of the FeAs4 tetrahedron and the a-axis\nlength. Systematic spectroscopies of SC property on Ln(1111)\nsystems with T c > 50 K are highly desired in the future in order\nto unravel the Fermi surface topologies and their relevance with\nSC gap structures.\n\n[13] A.

Concluding remarks\nThe underdoped high-T c cuprates revealing the uniform coexistence of AFM and SC are in the strong correlation regime\nwhich is unchanged even with mobile holes. This Mott physics\nplays a vital role for mediating the Cooper pairs to make T c of\nHTSC very high. On the other hand, in iron-oxypnictides, the\nrole of AFM interaction in T c is even less clear and the correlation effect is not clearly visible experimentally [58]. Rather,\na large d \u2212 p hybridization in the 1111 family generates a\nlarge band-insulating-like pseudogap (hybridization gap). In\nthis context, we remark that the stronger correlation in HTSC\nthan in FeAs-based superconductors may make T c higher significantly.\nThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Specially\nPromoted Research (20001004) and by the Global COE Program (MEXT).\nReferences\n[1] G.J.
