Indeed, assuming that resistivity is proportional to the solid solution solute content as it is usually done [1], one gets\ndirect access to the solute supersaturation. The so-called LSW theory (Lifshitz and Slyozov [2] and Wagner [3]) as extended by Ardell [4] allows then\n\u2217 emmanuel.clouet@cea.fr\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n2 November 2018\n\n\fto deduce from these measurements key parameters like the solubility, the\nprecipitate interface free energy and the solute diffusion coefficient.\nNumerous such measurements exist in Al-Sc alloys [5\u201310]. They have been\nintended to characterize the precipitation of the Al3 Sc L12 structure in aluminum alloys. In a previous study [11], we used cluster dynamics to model precipitation in Al-Zr and Al-Sc alloys. This mesoscopic modeling was shown to\nprovide predictions of the precipitate size distributions in quantitative agreement with available experimental data [12\u201314]. It is therefore worth seeing\nif such an agreement can be obtained also with resistivity measurements.\nThe purpose is mainly to see how predictive cluster dynamics can be, i.e.\nif one can obtain reliable information concerning the precipitates as well as\nthe solid solution in the whole time range of precipitation kinetics and not\nonly in the asymptotic limit of the coarsening stage like LSW theory does.\nConfronting cluster dynamics predictions with resistivity measurements will\nvalidate too the multiscale approach developed for precipitation in Al-Zr-Sc\nalloys [11, 15\u201318]. The use of resistivity experiments to validate a multiscale\nkinetic modeling has already proved its efficiency for irradiated iron [19].\nThe first part of this article explains how resistivity can be modeled within the\nframework of cluster dynamics. A thorough comparison between the obtained\nmodel predictions and available experimental data is then performed. This\nallows us to conclude on the validity of the interface free energies which are\nobtained through such measurements.\n\n2\n\nCluster gas model of electrical resistivity\n\nCluster dynamics models the phase-separating alloy as a gas of solute clusters\nwhich exchange solute atoms by single atom diffusion. Clusters are assumed\nto be spherical and are described by a single parameter, the number nSc of\nsolute atoms they contain. The time evolution of the cluster size distribution is\ngoverned by a master equation which input parameters are the solute diffusion\ncoefficient and the precipitate interface free energy. For Al-Sc alloys, these\nneeded parameters were directly deduced from an atomic diffusion model [15,\n16,18] previously built for Al-Zr-Sc alloys. It should be stressed that, although\nnone of these input parameters were intentionally fitted, cluster dynamics\nmanaged to reproduce reasonably experimental data on the time evolution of\nthe precipitate size distribution. The reader is referred to Ref. 11 for a full\ndescription of cluster dynamics modeling and its application to Al-Sc alloys.\nWe will only describe in the following how this technique can be adapted to\nmodel electrical resistivity of a phase-separating Al-Sc alloy.\n2\n\n\f2.1 Cluster contribution to electrical resistivity\n\nSo as to use cluster dynamics to simulate the evolution of the electrical resistivity during the annealing of a supersaturated solid solution, we assume\nthat the total resistivity of the cluster gas is given by the sum of each cluster\nresistivity. Doing so, we neglect any interference between clusters. Therefore,\nthe input parameters of the modeling are the contributions of each cluster,\ni.e. \u03c1nSc for a cluster containing nSc solute atoms. Some calculations of this\ncontribution exist in the literature (for a review, see Ref. 1). Most of them\nhave been aimed to explain the increase of resistivity at the beginning of the\nprecipitation kinetics in alloys like Al(Zn), Al(Ag), Al(Cu) or Al(Cr), showing\nthat this resistivity increase is associated with the apparition of small clusters\n(\u223c 10 \u2212 20 \u00c5).\nAll these calculations consider the elastic scattering of valence electrons by the\nperturbing potential due to the presence of the solute atoms composing the\ncluster. They show that solute atoms which are agglomerated in a small cluster\ncan have a higher resistivity than the same isolated solute atoms because of\nBragg scattering. Indeed, the smallest the cluster, the most relaxed the Bragg\nconditions for the electron scattering by the perturbing potential. This can lead\nto a high resistivity for small clusters. The scattering anisotropy increases with\nthe cluster size and, as the cluster size gets of the order of the electron mean\nfree path, the scattering becomes Bragg-like leading to a small contribution\nof the cluster to the resistivity.\nIn Al-Sc alloys, such an increase of the resistivity in the beginning of the\nprecipitation kinetics has never been observed experimentally [5\u201310]. Actually,\nit does not seem to exist in alloys where the solute is a transition element and\nthe solvent a free electron like metal [20]. Therefore, precise calculations of\neach cluster contribution to the electrical resistivity may not be required for\nAl-Sc alloys. Moreover, these calculations are limited to small clusters as one\nassumes that the perturbing potential of the cluster does not modify the Fermi\nsurface of the solvent and that electrons are scattered only once by the cluster\n(Born approximation). Such assumptions are reasonable only as long as the\ncluster does not contain more than a few solute atoms (\u223c10) but do not really\napply for larger clusters. On the other hand, for clusters with a stoichiometric\ncomposition, one can consider that the conductivity is infinite inside the cluster\nand that electrons are only scattered by the interface between the cluster and\nthe matrix. For a sharp interface, this leads to a cluster contribution to the\nresistivity proportional to its cross section [1] and therefore to its interface\narea as clusters are assumed spherical. This leads then to \u03c1nSc = \u03c11 nSc 2/3 , and\nthe electrical resistivity of the phase separating system at time t is simply\n3\n\n\fgiven by\nn\u2217\n\n\u03c1(t) =\n\n\u03c10Al\n\n+ \u03c11\n\nSc\nX\n\nCnSc (t)nSc 2/3\n\n(1)\n\nnSc =1\n\nwhere CnSc (t) is the atomic fraction of clusters containing nSc solute atoms.\nThe time evolution of this cluster size distribution is governed by the cluster\ndynamics master equations (Eq. 2 and 3 in Ref. 11). In Eq. 1, we have assumed\nthat only clusters smaller than a critical size n\u2217Sc contribute to the electrical\nresistivity. We will see below which value this critical size has to be given in\norder to fit experimental data. \u03c10Al is the electrical resistivity of the solvent (Al\nin this case). It is temperature dependent and is known experimentally. The\nonly remaining unknown parameter in Eq. 1 is the contribution \u03c11 of a solute\nmonomer to the electrical resistivity.\nThe increase of resistivity with Sc content has been measured at 77 K by\nFujikawa et al. [6, 21] who give \u03b4\u03c1Sc = 3400 n\u03a9m per Sc atomic fraction.\nThese measurements have been performed in under-saturated and therefore\nvery dilute Al-Sc solid solutions. One can reasonably assumes that most of the\nsolute are monomers and ignore larger clusters 1 , with the consequence that\n\u03c11 = \u03b4\u03c1Sc = 3400 n\u03a9m. Assuming that Matthienssen rule [1] is obeyed, this\nquantity does not depend on the temperature. Different measured values of\n\u03b4\u03c1Sc ranging from 3000 to 8200 n\u03a9m per Sc atomic fraction can be found in\nthe literature (for a review, see Tab. 2 in Ref. 10). Nevertheless we find that\nthe value measured by Fujikawa et al. [6, 21] is the one that leads to the best\nagreement between the simulated and the experimental resistivity variations\nduring precipitation kinetics.\n\n2.2 Critical size\nAs already recalled above, the input parameters of cluster dynamics, i.e. the\nprecipitate interface free energy and the Sc diffusion coefficients, were directly\ndeduced from an atomic diffusion model [11]. The only left parameter needed\nto calculate electrical resistivity is the critical size n\u2217Sc appearing in Eq. 1. So\nas to determine this boundary between clusters which are contributing or not\nto the electrical resistivity, we compare our predictions using different values\nfor n\u2217Sc with experimental data (Fig. 1). If one assumes that only monomers\nare contributing to the electrical resistivity (n\u2217Sc = 1), cluster dynamics do\nnot reproduce experimental data. Indeed the simulated resistivity decreases\ntoo quickly during the precipitation kinetics. So as to obtain the plateau experimentally observed at the beginning, one has to take into account the con1\n\nThe maximal solubility limit of Sc in aluminum is 0.288 at.%. We have checked\nwith our cluster gas model of electrical resistivity in Al-Sc that only the monomer\ncontribution is relevant for such a low nominal concentration.\n\n4\n\n\ftributions of small clusters (nSc \u2264 10), especially the dimer one. With these\ncontributions, the simulated resistivity decreases at the right time, but the\nfinal plateau experimentally observed is not reproduced. Indeed, cluster dynamics predicts that resistivity decreases to reach a value close to the one\ncorresponding to the equilibrium solid solution, whereas experimental data\nshow an excess resistivity. The final plateau corresponding to this excess resistivity can only be obtained if one considers that all clusters are contributing\nto the resistivity (n\u2217Sc = \u221e 2 ). With this value of the critical size, the experimental time evolution of the resistivity is reasonably reproduced by cluster\ndynamics.\nSo as to better understand the evolution of the electrical resistivity we monitor the cluster size distribution 3 and each cluster contribution to resistivity\n(Fig. 2) at different times of the precipitation kinetics for the supersaturation\nand the annealing temperature corresponding to Fig. 1. At the beginning of\n2\n\nCluster dynamics equations can be solved only for a finite number of classes.\nThe infinite size in the simulations corresponds to a maximal size which can be as\nlarge as \u223c 1012 solute atoms. We check that the concentration of clusters having\nthis maximal size does not evolve during the simulation. If this is not the case, the\nmaximal size is increased.\n3 Looking at the cluster size distribution, one should notice the abnormally high\nconcentration of clusters containing 8 solute atoms. This is due to the low interface\nfree energy associated with this size because of the existence of a compact cluster\ncorresponding to a cube for this size [15].\n\nExp. data\nCD : nSc* = 1\n2\n10\n\u221e\n\n31\n\n\u03c1 (n\u03a9m)\n\n30\n\n29\n\n28\n\n27\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\nt (s)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\nFig. 1.

As precipitation goes on, the solid solution becomes depleted and\nthus the atomic fractions of small clusters decrease. For t \u2265 106 s, one can\nneglect the contributions of these small clusters to resistivity. On the contrary,\nas the precipitating phase appears, more and more large clusters are present\nin the system and only these large clusters contribute to the resistivity. For\ninstance, for t = 106 s, almost all the resistivity is due to clusters containing\nbetween 10 and 50 solute atoms.

They followed the resistivity evolution during the precipitation\nkinetics for different annealing temperatures between 190 and 470\u25e6 C. All resistivity measurements were performed at room temperature for which the\npure Al resistivity was measured to be \u03c10Al = 27.0 n\u03a9m. For temperatures\nlower than 330\u25e6 C, they observed that precipitates remain coherent and that\nprecipitation is homogeneous. One can therefore compare their resistivity experimental data with cluster dynamics simulations (Fig. 3). A good agreement\nis obtained, especially for the lowest temperatures. Indeed, simulations manage to reproduce the resistivity fast decrease during the nucleation and growth\nstage as well as the slower variation which follows during coarsening. Nevertheless, for the highest temperature (330\u25e6 C) which corresponds to a lower\nsupersaturation (Tab. 1), simulations appear to be too fast compared to experimental data. The shape of the curve is correct, but there is a timescale\nshift between the simulated and the experimental resistivity.\nR\u00f8yset and Ryum [10] used their resistivity measurements to follow the Sc\ntransformed fraction. In their treatment, they estimated the equilibrium solid\nsolution from extrapolation of resistivity measurements in the coarsening stage\n4\n\nThey actually measured by EDS analysis a slightly higher composition, x0Sc =\n0.138 at.%, but cluster dynamics simulations obtained with this measured concentration do not significantly differ from those obtained with the nominal composition.\n190\u00b0C\n230\u00b0C\n270\u00b0C\n330\u00b0C\n\n31\n\n\u03c1 (n\u03a9m)\n\n30\n\n29\n\n28\n\n27\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\nt (s)\n\nFig. 3.

They found that this method gave erroneous solvus estimates\nat low precipitation temperatures. Our simulations (Fig. 3) show that this is\nbecause of the excess resistivity associated with large clusters in the coarsening stage. For high annealing temperatures (330\u25e6 C for instance), the measured\nresistivity is close to the equilibrium one, but for the lowest temperatures the\ndifference cannot be neglected. When taking into account this excess resistivity one gets Sc transformed fractions different from those obtained by R\u00f8yset\nand Ryum (cf. appendix A). This explains why these authors deduced a wrong\nsolubility limit for Sc in aluminum (Fig. 11 in Ref. 10), which they pointed out\nthemselves, from their resistivity measurements. As cluster dynamics parameters were obtained so as to reproduce the experimental solubility limit [11]\nand as our simulations manage to reproduce R\u00f8yset and Ryum resistivity measurements, we can conclude that these measurements completely agree with\nthe assessed Sc solubility limit [22].\n\n3.2 Al - 0.24 at.% Sc\n\n250\u00b0C\n300\u00b0C\n350\u00b0C\n400\u00b0C\n\n36\n\n\u03c1 (n\u03a9 m)\n\n34\n\n32\n\n30\n\n28\n\u22122\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\nt (s)\n\nFig. 4.

For\nthe lowest annealing temperatures (250, 300 and 350\u25e6 C), the agreement is\nperfect in all the different stages of the precipitation kinetics. For the highest\ntemperature (400\u25e6 C), the simulated resistivity decreases too fast compared to\nthe experimental one in the nucleation - growth stage. One should notice that\nthe predicted evolution for this temperature is really fast and that the resistivity drop appears at a time (t \u223c 10 s) which is too small to be precisely observed\nexperimentally. Nevertheless, even for this temperature, simulations manage\nto reproduce the slow decreasing of electrical resistivity during coarsening.\n\n3.3 Al - 0.17 at.% Sc\n\n\u03c1 (n\u03a9 m)\n\n8\n\nCluster dynamics: 400\u00b0C\n450\u00b0C\nExp.: 400\u00b0C\n450\u00b0C\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nr (nm)\n\n30\n20\nsemi\u2212coherent\ncoherent\n10\n0\n0\n10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\nt (s)\n\n6\n\n10\n\nFig. 5.

[9] studied an aluminum alloy with 0.17 at.% Sc where they\nfollowed the resistivity during precipitation and measured the mean precipitate radius using transmission electron microscopy. All measurements were\n10\n\n\fperformed in the coarsening stage, after the resistivity had dropped because\nof precipitate nucleation and growth. As a consequence, only a partial comparison can be made with cluster dynamics (Fig. 5). The reasonable agreement\nobtained between the simulated and the experimental resistivities is not really\nsignificant as resistivity does not vary too much in the observed time range.\nDue to the high temperatures of study (T \u2265 400\u25e6C), the experimental as well\nas the simulated resistivities during coarsening are already close to that of the\nequilibrium solid solution.\nCluster dynamics manage to reproduce too the variations of the precipitate\nmean radius (Fig. 5). For radii greater than \u223c 15 nm, Watanabe et al. observed that semi-coherent precipitates coexist with coherent ones. It should be\npointed out that coherency loss is not taken into account in our simulations\nwhich handle only coherent precipitates. Despite this assumption, cluster dynamics predictions are not too bad. This may indicate that the fraction of\nsemi-coherent precipitates is small or that these precipitates have an interface\nfree energy not too far from the one of coherent precipitates.\n3.4 Al - 0.09 at.% Sc and Al - 0.15 at.% Sc\nJo and Fujikawa [6] followed the resistivity variations in two different aluminum solid solutions containing 0.09 and 0.15 at.% Sc. The simulated evolutions of the electrical resistivity do not reproduce well their measurements\n(Fig. 6). The resistivity drop associated with the nucleation and growth stage\nappears to occur too fast in simulations. Moreover, the slow decrease of the\nexcess resistivity during coarsening is not as well reproduced as with other experimental data. Here, only a semi-quantitative agreement could be obtained.\n3.5 Summary\nSome more experimental data on resistivity measurements in Al-Sc alloys are\navailable in the literature, but they cannot be used for a comparison with our\nsimulations. Indeed, Nakayama et al. [7] studied an alloy containing 0.138 at.%\nSc aged at 250, 300 and 350\u25e6 C. But they normalized their measurements and\ndid not specify the measuring temperature nor the corresponding pure Al\nresistivity, thus forbidding any use of their data. Drits et al. [5] studied an\nalloy the Sc composition of which is larger than the Sc solubility limit and\neven the eutectic composition. Some primary Al3 Sc precipitates may have\nappeared during the solidification and the alloy could not have been homogenized. Therefore, one can doubt that this alloy initial state corresponds to\na homogeneous supersaturated solid solution as assumed by our simulations.\nNevertheless, all the previously reviewed experimental data already allow to\n11\n\n\f260\u00b0C\n300\u00b0C\n370\u00b0C\n\n\u03c1 (n\u03a9 m)\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\nt (s)\n\n6\n\n10\n\n(a) x0Sc = 0.09 at.%\n8\n\n260\u00b0C\n300\u00b0C\n370\u00b0C\n\n\u03c1 (n\u03a9 m)\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\nt (s)\n\n6\n\n10\n\n(b) x0Sc = 0.15 at.%\nFig. 6. Time evolution of the resistivity \u03c1 experimentally observed [6] and deduced\nfrom cluster dynamics simulations for two solid solutions of composition x0Sc = 0.09\nand 0.15 at.%.\n\ndraw main conclusions about the ability of cluster dynamics to predict electrical resistivity evolution during precipitation kinetics in Al-Sc alloys.\nExcept for Jo and Fujikawa's data [6] for which only a poor agreement could\nbe obtained, cluster dynamics manage to reproduce reasonably well experimental measurements of electrical resistivity [8\u201310]. For the highest annealing\ntemperatures corresponding to the lowest supersaturations, a time shift could\n12\n\n\fappear between the simulated and the experimental resistivity, the time evolution predicted by cluster dynamics being too fast. Nevertheless, in all cases,\nthe global shape of the evolution is correctly predicted. One can guess that\na better description of the resistivity drop during precipitate nucleation and\ngrowth may be obtained if one would calculate precisely the small cluster\ncontributions. But our simple model assuming a cluster contribution to the\nresistivity proportional to its area already leads to good predictions. Most\nimportantly, cluster dynamics manage to reproduce quantitatively the slow\nresistivity decrease during coarsening. This decrease arises from the evolution of the large cluster distribution and the surface dependency assumption\nappears to be correct for these clusters.\nAn improvement of the agreement between cluster dynamics simulations and\nexperimental data may arise too from a more precise calculation of the emission and condensation rate coefficients appearing in cluster dynamics master\nequation as suggested by L\u00e9pinoux [23, 24]. But, doing so, we will lose one of\nthe main advantages of our approach, i.e. the ease with which the parameters\nof the mesoscopic modeling can be deduced from a very limited number of\ninput data. In view of its simplicity, the ability of our approach to reproduce\nresistivity measurements appears more than reasonable.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nResistivity measurements are often combined with precipitate size determination using transmission microscopy so as to deduce from experimental data\nalloy parameters like the solute diffusion coefficient, the solubility limit, and\nthe precipitate interface free energy. This can be done with the help of the\nLSW theory [2, 3]. Indeed, Lifshitz and Slyozov [2] and Wagner [3] show that\nthe precipitate mean radius varies linearly with the power 1/3 of the time in\nthe coarsening asymptotic limit. Ardell [4] then extended the theory to predict\nthe variation of the solid solution concentration. Applying his results [25], the\nscandium concentration of the aluminum solid solution at time t should be\ngiven by\n\u22121/3\nxSc (t) = xeq\n,\n(2)\nSc + (\u03bat)\n5\nwhere xeq\nSc is the scandium solubility in aluminum and the rate constant \u03ba is\n\nDSc\n\u03ba=\n9\n\nkT\neq\nxSc \u03c3\u0304\u03a9\n\n5\n\n!2\n\nxpSc .\n\n(3)\n\nWhen using results obtained by Calderon et al. [25] for non pure precipitates, we\np\nassume an ideal solid solution and we use the fact that xeq\nSc << xSc .\n\n13\n\n\fDSc is the scandium impurity diffusion coefficient in aluminum, xpSc = 1/4 is\nthe Sc atomic fraction in the precipitate, \u03c3\u0304 is the infinite radius limit of the\ninterface free energy between Al3 Sc precipitates and aluminum, and \u03a9 = a3 /4\nis the mean atomic volume corresponding to one lattice site (a = 4.032 \u00c5 for\nAl). Recently, Ardell and Ozolins [26] showed that the solute concentration\ncan vary as the inverse square root of the time, and not the cube root like in\nEq. 2, in the case where the precipitates present a ragged interface. This is not\nthe case in Al-Sc alloys as the Al3 Sc precipitate interfaces are rather sharp as\nshown by our atomic simulations [15,16]. Therefore, one expects Eq. 2 to hold\nfor this system.\nTo make use of resistivity measurements, one usually assumes that resistivity\ndepends linearly on the solid solution concentration. With the help of Eq. 2\nand 3, one can then get information on the desired parameters, i.e. DSc , xeq\nSc\nor \u03c3\u0304. We previously saw that this linear relation between electrical resistivity\nand solute concentration does not hold in a phase-separating supersaturated\nAl-Sc solid solution as the resistivity has to be proportional to the cluster\nmean section (Eq. 1). It is worth looking at the error due to the fact that\none identifies the solute concentration with the cluster mean section when\nexploiting resistivity measurements.\nTo do so, we need first to define the solid solution concentration in the cluster\ndynamics simulations. This is not so easy as this modeling technique describes\nthe phase-separating alloy as a gas of solute clusters. Therefore, it does not\ndifferentiate between the solid solution and the precipitates at variance with\nprecipitation classical descriptions like LSW theory (cf. Ref. 27 for a better\nunderstanding of the differences between cluster dynamics and classical theories). Nevertheless, one can discriminate the solid solution and the precipitates\nwith the help of a threshold size nth\nSc . Below this size, clusters represents fluctuations in the solid solution and above it they represent stable precipitates.\nThe solid solution concentration is thus given by\nth\n\nxSc (t) =\n\nnSc\nX\n\nnSc CnSc (t)\n\n(4)\n\nnSc =1\n\nIn a supersaturated solid solution, one natural choice for this threshold size\nis the critical size n\u2217Sc . In cluster dynamics, this is the size for which the\ncondensation rate \u03b2nSc is equal to the emission rate \u03b1nSc . Below this size, \u03b2nSc\nis smaller than \u03b1nSc and clusters have more chance to re-dissolve themselves\nthan to grow. This definition works as long as we do not enter in the coarsening\nstage. A minimum for a size nmin\nSc then appears in the cluster size distribution\nmin\n6\n8\n(nSc = 3 for t = 10 and 10 s in Fig. 2). Once the critical size n\u2217Sc gets higher\n\u2217\nthan nmin\nSc , the quantity of matter contained in clusters smaller than nSc begins\nto increase artificially because of small precipitates which become unstable.\n14\n\n\fWe then choose the following definition for the threshold size:\n\u2217\n\u2022 nth\nSc = nSc , as long as the cluster size distribution does not show any minimum,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2217\nmin\n\u2022 nth\n=\nmin\nn\n,\nn\notherwise.\nSc\nSc\nSc\n\n\u22125\n\n4\u00d710\n\n\u22125\n\n2\u00d710\n\n330\u00b0C : xSc(t) CD\n\n(\u03c1(t)\u2212\u03c1\u00b0Al) / \u03b4\u03c1Sc CD\nxSc(t) LSW\n\n0\n\n270\u00b0C : xSc(t) CD\n\n(\u03c1(t)\u2212\u03c1\u00b0Al) / \u03b4\u03c1Sc CD\n\n\u22125\n\n4\u00d710\n\nxSc(t) LSW\n\n\u22125\n\n2\u00d710\n\n0\n0\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22123\n\n2\u00d710\n3\u00d710\n\u22121/3\n\u22121/3\nt\n(s )\n\n\u22123\n\n4\u00d710\n\nFig. 7.

Using the solid solubility xeq\nSc , the diffusion coefficient DSc and the interface free energy \u03c3\u0304 which the simulations rely on (cf.\nRef. 15 and 11 for a full description of the way clusters dynamics parameters\nwere obtained), we can calculate coefficients entering Eq. 2. The comparison\nwith cluster dynamics simulations (Fig. 7) shows that LSW perfectly manages\nto predict the asymptotic behavior of the solid solution concentration xSc (t).\nOn the other hand, Fig. 7 shows that the asymptotic behavior of the normalized resistivity (\u03c1(t) \u2212 \u03c10Al ) /\u03b4\u03c1Sc differs from the one of the solid solution\nconcentration. Both quantities tend to a limit close to the scandium solubility\nxeq\nSc in aluminum, but the resistivity cannot be assumed to vary linearly with\n\u22121/3\nt\n. If one does so, the proportionality coefficient will differ from the one\n15\n\n\fpredicted by LSW theory (Eq. 3). As a consequence, if one assumes that the\nresistivity is proportional to the solid solution concentration and uses LSW\ntheory to deduce alloy properties from experimental data, the obtained solid\nsolubility will be correct, but not the proportionality coefficient \u03ba. In particular, one cannot deduce from resistivity measurements any reliable value for the\nprecipitate interface free energy \u03c3\u0304 or the solute diffusion coefficient DSc . The\nlower the annealing temperature, the bigger the error on these parameters. For\ninstance, fitting with Eq. 2 and 3 the normalized resistivity evolution in Fig. 7,\none would get \u03c3\u0304 = 2200 instead of 113 mJ.m\u22122 at T = 330\u25e6 C. This clearly\nillustrates that resistivity measurements cannot be used to determine interface\nfree energy in a phase-separating alloy as long as precipitates contribute to\nresistivity.\nOf course, this conclusion does not hold anymore when this precipitate contribution cancels. Indeed Watanabe et al. [9] manages to observe a linear variation of the resistivity with t\u22121/3 . This behavior was obtained once the precipitates became incoherent. Therefore, one can reasonably assume that incoherent Al3 Sc precipitates do not contribute anymore to resistivity. The interface\nfree energies they deduced from their resistivity measurements (230 mJ.m\u22122\nbetween 400 and 450\u25e6C) is higher than the one used in our simulations (119 \u2265\n\u03c3\u0304 \u2265 105 mJ.m\u22122 between 200 and 500\u25e6 C) which was deduced from the atomic\ndiffusion model of Ref. 15, 18. This is in agreement with the fact that incoherent precipitates should have a higher interface free energy than coherent\nones.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nCluster dynamics has been shown to be able to reproduce electrical resistivity\nvariations during precipitation in Al-Sc alloys. One should recall that the only\ninput parameters required by this modeling technique are the solute diffusion\ncoefficients, the precipitate/aluminum interface free energy and the resistivity\nincrease per solute atom. None of these parameters was adjusted to fit the\nexperimental data. Indeed, the experimental data measured by Fujikawa et\nal. [6, 21] was used for the resistivity increase with solute content (\u03b4\u03c1Sc =\n3400 n\u03a9m). Good predictions were obtained with this experimental value.\nAs for the solute diffusion coefficients and the interface free energies, they\nwere directly deduced [11] from an atomic model previously developed for\nAl-Zr-Sc alloys [15, 18]. The good agreement obtained between our resistivity\nsimulations and experimental data allows then us to stress the correctness of\nthe Al3 Sc interface free energies used in our simulations. For temperatures\nranging between 200 and 500\u25e6 C, this interface free energy corresponding to\ncoherent Al3 Sc precipitates is varying between 119 and 105 mJ.m\u22122 .\n16\n\n\fOne of the key assumptions of our simulations is that all clusters contribute\nto electrical resistivity and that each cluster contribution is proportional to\nits area. Although this assumption may look crude, it leads to quantitative\npredictions. In particular, it manages to reproduce the resistivity excess and\nits slow decrease during coarsening. This excess resistivity mainly arises from\nlarge clusters contributions whereas the solid solution contribution can be neglected. As a consequence, resistivity measurements during coarsening do not\nreally allow to follow the solid solution concentration. In particular, resistivity\ndo not obey LSW theory in a phase-separating system like supersaturated AlSc alloys at variance with the solid solution concentration. This involves that\none cannot deduce from these measurements correct values of the precipitate\ninterface free energy or of the solute diffusion coefficients. On the other hand,\nsolubility limits obtained from resistivity experiments are correct as both the\nnormalized resistivity and the solid solution concentration tend to the same\nvalue for long enough annealing times.\n\nA\n\nReinterpretation of R\u00f8yset experimental data\n\nUsually, one uses electrical resistivity measurements to define the fraction of\nprecipitated solute\n\u03c1(t) \u2212 \u03c10\nX\u03c1 (t) = eq\n,\n(A.1)\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10\nwhere \u03c1(t) is the resistivity of the solid solution measured at time t and \u03c10 and\n\u03c1eq are respectively the initial and equilibrium resistivities. If the resistivity\nwas truly proportional to the solute concentration like it can be assumed in\nan under-saturated solid solution, this definition would be equivalent to the\none obtained from considering the solid solution concentration instead of the\nresistivity. But in a phase-separating system like supersaturated Al-Sc solid\nsolution, both definitions lead to different quantities.\nIn their work [10], R\u00f8yset and Ryum used Eq. A.1 to define the precipitated\nfraction. Assuming that resistivity varies linearly with t\u22121/3 in the coarsening\nstage, extrapolation of data to infinite time was used to estimate the equilibrium resistivity \u03c1eq . This leads to a correct value of \u03c1eq for the higher annealing\ntemperatures but not for the lower ones (T \u2264 330\u25e6 C). Indeed, as we previously\nsaw, one cannot assume that resistivity follows the same time dependence as\nthe solid solution concentration due to the large cluster contributions to electrical resistivity. Therefore \u03c1eq cannot be obtained from such an extrapolation\nto infinite time, and it has to be calculated from the equilibrium Sc solubility in\naluminum and the linear relation [6, 21] between resistivity and concentration\nexisting in dilute solid solutions leading to\n\u03c1eq = \u03c10Al + \u03b4\u03c1Sc xeq\nSc ,\n17\n\n(A.2)\n\n\fX\u03c1\n\nX\u03c1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(a) T = 230\u00b0C\n\n(b) T = 250\u00b0C\n\n0.75\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0\n102\nX\u03c1\n\nR\u00f8yset data\nAfter correction\n103\n\n104\nt (s)\n\n105\n\n0\n102\n\n106\nX\u03c1\n\n1\n\n103\n\n104\nt (s)\n\n105\n\n106\n\n1\n\n(c) T = 270\u00b0C\n\n(d) T = 290\u00b0C\n\n0.75\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0\n102\nX\u03c1\n\nR\u00f8yset data\nAfter correction\n\nR\u00f8yset data\nAfter correction\n103\n\n104\nt (s)\n\n105\n\n0\n102\n\n106\nX\u03c1\n\n1\n\n103\n\n104\nt (s)\n\n105\n\n106\n\n1\n\n(e) T = 310\u00b0C\n\n(f) T = 330\u00b0C\n\n0.75\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0\n102\n\nR\u00f8yset data\nAfter correction\n\n0.25\nR\u00f8yset data\nAfter correction\n103\n\n104\nt (s)\n\n105\n\n0\n102\n\n106\n\nR\u00f8yset data\nAfter correction\n103\n\n104\nt (s)\n\n105\n\n106\n\nFig. A.1. Evolution with time of the precipitated fraction X\u03c1 in an aluminum solid\nsolution of composition x0Sc = 0.12 at.%. X\u03c1 has been deduced from experimental resistivity measurements [10] considering the equilibrium resistivity is reached\n(R\u00f8yset data) or not (after correction) for the longest annealing time.\n\nThe precipitated fraction X\u03c1 obtained calculating \u03c1eq in this way differs from\nthe one obtained by R\u00f8yset and Ryum who assumed that \u03c1eq corresponds to\nthe resistivity measurements for the longest annealing time (Fig. A.1). This is\na clear manifestation of the large cluster contributions to electrical resistivity.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. R\u00f8yset and Dr. Watanabe for providing experimental data.
