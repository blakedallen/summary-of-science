These methods seem\nparticularly useful to the study of chaos since no analytical chaotic solution is currently\navailable. Using the well-known Lorenz equations as an example, it is demonstrated that\nnumerically computed results and their associated statistical properties are time-step\ndependent.

The\nexistence of a virtual separatrix presents the possibility of a computed trajectory actually\n\"jumping\" through it due to the finite time-steps of discrete numerical methods.

Thus, reports of computed non-periodic solutions of chaotic\ndifferential equations are simply consequences of unstably amplified truncation errors,\nand are not approximate solutions of the associated differential equations.\n\n1\n\n\f1. Introduction\nIn spite of numerous attempts, a convincing proof of the existence of the geometric\nLorenz attractor for the Lorenz's differential equations was not achieved until recently.\nTucker (2002) provided a solution to this problem, which is the 14th of the 18\nchallenging mathematical problems defined by Smale (1998). Viana (2000), in a review\nof the historical advancement of structural stability theories, explained the difficulties that\nTucker had to overcome to complete his proof. The next step in the progression of this\nimportant research topic is the construction of an existing solution. Without proof of the\nexistence of chaotic solutions of nonlinear differential equations, Tucker's solution is\nonly valid for algebraic mappings. Equivalently, a non-periodic structure associated with\nSmale's horseshoe is for algebraic mappings only, as is explained in section 5 when we\ndiscuss the Lorenz attractors.\nA possible approach to this issue is direct numerical integration, which is a powerful,\npopular, and convenient tool for solving initial-value problems for nonlinear differential\nequations arising in science and engineering. The use of such tools introduces truncation\nand rounding errors that often have a major impact on the quality of \"computed results,\"\nwhich are the product of an application of a certain algorithm in a certain computing\nenvironment. The major goal of this paper is to demonstrate why approximate chaotic\nsolutions cannot be constructed by the current generation of such methods. The\nimportant consequence is that the existence of chaotic solutions of differential equations\nhas never been adequately demonstrated in spite of reports to the contrary.\nIn all specific cases reported in this paper, \"computed results\" fail to provide an\napproximate solution in any sense to the original initial-value problem. These ideas are\nstudied for a particular chaotic system based on the well-known Lorenz equations for\nvariables x(t), y(t), and z(t). It is demonstrated that the numerical integration of this\nchaotic system is extremely sensitive to the integration time-step. Coupled with this\nbehavior is the fact that different integration time-steps yield both \"computed results\" and\ncomputed statistical properties of the associated attractors that are dramatically different.\nThese statistical properties can often be associated with physical quantities of interest in\n\n2\n\n\fapplications from science and engineering. Of course, any \"computed results\" whose\nstatistical properties are sensitive to integration time-steps are not useful.\nThe R\u00f6ssler equations (Stuart & Humphries, 1996, pp. 532-533) display a sensitivity of\n\"computed results\" to integration time-steps. R\u00f6ssler himself noted, in the fall of 1975\n(R\u00f6ssler 2000, p. 213), the important role-played by integration time-steps in his system.\nHowever, there was no attempt to connect this sensitivity to the statistical properties of\nthe \"similar\" attractors shown in Figure 7.1 of Stuart & Humphries (1996), and no\nexplanations for these observations were provided. The sensitivity of \"computed results\"\nto integration time-steps has also been studied for the one-dimensional KuramotoSivashinsky equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation (Yao 2007).\nThe sensitivity to initial conditions has been studied for hyperbolic systems (Bowen\n1975) and is an active topic for nearly hyperbolic systems (Dawson, Grebogi, Sauer, &\nYorke 1994; Viana 2000; Palis 2000; Morales, Pacifico & Pujals 2002). In particular, the\nmethods of shadowing for hyperbolic systems have shown that trajectories may be locally\nsensitive to initial conditions while being globally insensitive since true trajectories with\nadjusted initial conditions exist. Such trajectories are called shadowing trajectories, and\nlie very close to the long-time computed trajectories. However, systems of differential\nequations arising from physical applications are not hyperbolic systems. If the attractor is\ntransitive (ergodic), all trajectories are inside the attractor so they are generally believed\nto be solutions of the underlying differential equations whatever the initial conditions.\nLittle is known about systems, which are not transitive (non-ergodic). Do & Lai (2004)\nhave provided a comprehensive review of previous work, and discussed the fundamental\ndynamical process indicating that a long-time shadowing of non-hyperbolic systems is\nnot possible.\nTwo important facts about the computation of numerical chaotic solutions of differential\nequations, which are not commonly known, are:\n1. No computed chaotic solution of the Lorenz system, which is independent of the\nintegration time-step, exists. The same conclusion can be extended to other chaotic\n\n3\n\n\fsituations, including the direct numerical simulation of turbulence through the\nNavier-Stokes equations.\n2. A sensitivity-to-initial-condition is frequently viewed as a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the existence of chaos by most readers. However, this property is also\nnoted in the solutions of all nonlinear differential equations when the values of their\ngoverning parameters are larger than appropriate critical values (Ghosh Moulic &\nYao 1996; Yao & Ghosh Moulic 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Yao 1999, 2007, 2009).\nConsequently, it cannot be argued that this sensitivity is a sufficient condition for\nchaos. It is worthwhile to note that the sensitivity to initial conditions associated with\na set of nonlinear differential equations is a reflection of a characteristic of a physical\nsystem; on the other hand, integration time-step is an artificial computational\nquantity. That a discrete numerical computation must not be time-step dependent in\norder to be considered as an approximate solution was first put forward by Von\nNeumann (Teixeira, Reynolds & Judd, 2007; Lorenz 2008; Yao & Hughes 2008a,\n2008b).\nIn this paper, I discuss the first of these issues in detail, showing that it is a consequence\nof unavoidable numerical errors, and briefly consider the second. In the next section, I\nshow that such \"computed results\" as well as a corresponding long-time averaged\nstatistical correlation display a sensitive dependence on integration time-steps. A\nsystematic decrease in the magnitude of the time steps does not lead to a convergent\npattern; rather irregularly fluctuating results are noted due to instabilities. Differences\nbetween different samples can be small in a suitable sense, but never demonstrate\nconvergence, indicating that the bounded \"computed results\" are contaminated by\nnumerical errors. Consequently, there is no guarantee that any of such \"solutions\" is\nclose to the correct one.\nThe third section contains a demonstration of the exponential amplification of a small\ndifference between two trajectories, which involve different integration time-steps,\noccurring when they move in the direction of an unstable manifold (the x-axis for the\nspecific cases treated here). When two different, as just mentioned, trajectories move in\n\n4\n\n\fthe direction of a stable manifold, their difference becomes smaller. This difference\ndepends on the initial error introduced by the different time-steps, and prevents the\ndetermination of an approximate computed solution by any discretized numerical\nmethod.\nIn the fourth section, I show that a significant amplification of numerical errors occurs\nwhen a trajectory, in violation of theoretical expectations, jumps through a twodimensional virtual separatrix. In contrast to the behavior noted in section 3, this\nbehavior is independent of the differences induced by the integration time-steps before\namplification.\nSection 5 shows that \"computed results\" can be used to construct a strange attractor, even\nthough they are time-step dependent. Each integration time-step generates its own\nalgebraic mapping. For such algebraic mappings, the computed trajectory seems to visit\nthe edges of the attractor less frequently. This observation agrees with the finding by\nTucker (2002) that the stretching rate near the edge of the attractor is smaller than\n\n2,\n\nthe\n\nrequired minimum value to ensure its transitivity (Viana 2000). Numerical computed\nresults do not demonstrated the property of topological transitivity so they are not\nergodic. Amazingly, it can be shown by following Tucker's computer assisted method\nthat attractors generated with different time-steps and contaminated by truncation errors\nsatisfy the properties of Smale's horseshoe.\nConclusions are discussed in the final section.\n2. Time-Step Sensitive Numerical Solutions\nI use the Lorenz equations,\n\nx\uf026 \uf03d \uf02d sx \uf02b sy ,\ny\uf026 \uf03d rx \uf02d y \uf02d xz ,\nz\uf026 \uf03d \uf02d bz \uf02b xy ,\nwith the widely used values of the parameters, s = 10, r = 28, b = 8/3, as the basis for\nshowing that the \"computed results\" are time-step dependent and do not converge for\n\n5\n\n(1)\n\n\flarge time. The initial conditions are x = 1, y = \u22121, z = 10. All results presented are\ngenerated by an explicit, second-order accurate Adams-Bashforth method. The time\nhistory of x is plotted in Figure 1 for three different time steps, clearly showing the\ndivergence of the \"computed results.\" Similar behavior was noted with Adams-Bashforth\nmethods up to the fifth order; an implicit Crank-Nicholson method; second-order and\nforth-order Runge-Kutta methods; adaptive methods; and compact time-difference\nschemes. In no case was a convergent solution obtained for t \uf0b3 20 .\nThe trajectory for one of the cases of Figure 1 (\u0394t = 0.0001) is shown in three projections\nin Figure 2 for the first 300,000 computational time steps. This figure is useful as a\ngeometric aid to identifying the location (and reasons) for the observed divergence.\nInitially, the trajectory moves smoothly around the two singular points (reverse spiral),\nand from one singular point to the other. However, at a certain time identified by an\narrow in the figure, the computed trajectory diverges. This behavior signals the \"breakdown\" of the computation; it will be discussed in greater detail in Section 4.\nThe apparent random behavior in Figure 1 is consistent with the common expectation that\nit is impossible to repeat the time histories of chaotic different equations due to their\nextreme sensitivity. On the other hand, in order to be useful in scientific or engineering\napplications, the statistical properties of a chaotic \"computed result,\" which can be of\nphysical significance, must not be sensitive to the integration time-step. As an example,\n\nFigure 3 displays the time-averaged L2 norms corresponding to the \"computed results\" of\nFigure 1,\n\nE (t ) \uf03d\n\n1 t 2\nx dt .\nt \uf0f20\n\nThey also strongly depend on the integration time-step. Computations for much longer\ntimes than the ones shown in the figure reveal that the various E(t) continue to be\ndependent on the integration time-step and do not converge. For long time, E(t) can be\ninterpreted as the moment of inertia of the numerical Lorenz attractor about x = 0 since\nthe attractor is assumed topologically transitive. Since E(t) is an important statistical and\ngeometric property of the attractor, different E(t) implies different attractors. The\n6\n\n\fgeometric properties of the \"computed results\" will be examined in the next section to\nshow that the sensitivity to integration time-steps is the consequence of repeated\namplification of numerical errors.\n3. Exponential Growth of Numerical Errors\nThe following discussion is based on the normal form of the Lorenz system (Tucker\n2002; Viana 2000). With s = 10, b = 8/3, and r = 28, these equations are\nx\uf026 \uf03d 11.8 x \uf02d 0.29( x \uf02b y ) z ,\ny\uf026 \uf03d \uf02d22.8 y \uf02b 0.29( x \uf02b y ) z ,\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nz\uf026 \uf03d \uf02d2.67 z \uf02b ( x \uf02b y )(2.2 x \uf02d 1.3 y )\n\nTheir three equilibrium points are (0, 0, 0) and \uf028 \uf0b15.5929, \uf0b1 2.8981, 26.8698 \uf029 . The\ncoefficients of the linear terms in (2) are eigenvalues and represent the growth rates of x,\ny, and z, respectively. The non-linear terms lead to energy transfers among x, y and z\n(Yao 1999). Far away from the three equilibrium points, the net effect is attracting since\nthe sum of the eigenvalues is negative. Once a trajectory moves close to the three\nequilibrium points, it is trapped in a complex attractor due to the competition between\nattraction and repulsion of the three equilibrium points. This shows that the Lorenz\nattractor is inside a large attracting open set; hence, it is robust (Viana 2000).\nThe Euler method is used to integrate equations (2). The initial conditions are the same\nas those used in Section 2. An explicit, second-order-accurate Adams-Bashforth method\nwas also used, and showed that the results were not dependent on these two \"lowaccuracy\" numerical methods. These results, when properly interpreted, identify two\nmechanisms that contribute to the sensitivity of the \"computed results\" to the integration\ntime-step. The first of these mechanisms will be discussed in the following material, the\nsecond in Section 4. This conclusion is insensitive to any particular numerical method as\nlong as it involves truncation errors since the computations have been repeated with highorder and higher-level finite-difference methods, interval methods, and series methods.\nThe first mechanism is associated with the movement of the trajectory toward the z-axis\n(Figure 4). Equations (2) shows that, as the value of (x + y) becomes small, the value of\n7\n\n\fthe non-linear terms in the z equation decreases to near zero. This causes z to move\nexponentially toward z = 0, but the time required to reach z = 0 is infinite.\nSimultaneously, the value of x increases exponentially so that the trajectory turns sharply\ntoward the direction of increasing x since the x-axis is the unstable manifold. In order to\nshow the sensitivity to the integration time-steps, two different time steps, but the same\ninitial conditions, were used to integrate equations (2). The results show that the errors\naccumulated before the trajectory reaches the z-axis are amplified exponentially along the\nx direction and cause substantial numerical errors in the computation. It is clear that this\namplification begins near the z-axis. The differences between the two trajectories for\ndifferent integration time-steps decrease as they approach the z axis (along the direction\nof the stable manifold), but start to increase exponentially as they turn toward the\ndirection of the unstable manifold. This is a typical example for a positive Lyapunov\nexponent, and also is a hint about the existence of Smale's horseshoe. As the \"computed\nresults\" repeatedly pass through the region just described, the corresponding trajectories\nmove further apart. The study of whether such trajectories are shadowable for nearlyhyperbolic systems is a current research topic (Palis 2000; Morales, Pacifico & Pujals\n2002; Tucker 2002). Even though it might be shadowable, its statistical properties,\nwhich have practical interest, cannot be determined (Dawson, Grebogi, Sauer & Yorke\n\n1994). Why should one take the effort to solve chaotic differential equations when no\nstatistical properties of the computed results can be determined?\n\n4. Explosive Amplification of Numerical Errors\nThe second mechanism occurs close to the z-axis where the trajectory can turn in two\nopposite directions depending on whether the trajectory arrives at positive or negative x\n(Figure 5) since the z-axis is the intersection of stable and unstable manifolds. This\nmeans that a small numerical error can be \"explosively\" amplified. The breakdown of\nthe computed results presented in Figure 2 belongs to this class. The reason for this\n\"unshadowable\" amplification of numerical errors is explained below.\n\n8\n\n\fIt will be demonstrated in Section 5 that the trajectory frequently visits the neighborhood\nof the z-axis (0 \u2264 z \u2264 15), where the values of x and y are small. It is clear from\nequations (2) that, if the trajectory starts on the z-axis, it will stay on it forever so that the\nz-axis is an invariant set for the saddle at the origin. A trajectory in the inset of a limit\npoint will approach the limit point asymptotically. The inset of an attractor is called its\nbasin. The separatrix is defined as the complement of the basins of attraction. The initial\nstate of a trajectory must belong to a separatrix if its future (\uf077) limit set is not an\nattractor. Therefore, a separatrix consists of the insets of the non-attractive (or\nexceptional) limit sets. An actual separatrix separates basins. However, if it does not\nactually separate basins, it is called a virtual separatrix (Abraham & Shaw 1992). A\ncomputed trajectory cannot penetrate a separatrix since that would violate the uniqueness\ntheorem. Thus, a computed trajectory that jumps through a separatrix means that the\n\"computed results\" violate the differential equations.\nThe following linearized analysis shows that the inset of the saddle point at the origin\nnear the z-axis is a two-dimensional surface that includes the z-axis. This inset is a\nvirtual separatrix embedded in the attractor. The first-order linearized version of\nequations (2) for small x and y, that is, near the z-axis, are\nx\uf026 \uf03d 11.8 x \uf02d 0.29( x \uf02b y ) z ,\ny\uf026 \uf03d \uf02d22.8 y \uf02b 0.29( x \uf02b y ) z ,\nz\uf026 \uf03d \uf02d2.67 z\n\n(3)\n\nThe solution for z is simply\n\nz \uf03d z0 e\uf02d2.67 t ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 z0 \u2264 15 is the initial z location inside the attractor. The trajectories that reach\nthe z-axis are found by setting\nx \uf03d h ( y, z ) \uf03d A( z ) y \uf02b O( y 2 ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere h(0, z ) \uf03d 0 and A(z) is a function to be determined. Equation (5) defines the local\n\n9\n\n\fstable and unstable manifolds near the z-axis. Using (5), the first two of equations (3)\nbecome\ndh\ny\uf026\ndy\ndh\n\uf03d\n\uf05b \uf02d22.8 y \uf02b 0.29(h \uf02b y ) z \uf05d\ndy\n\uf03d 11.8h \uf02d 0.29(h \uf02b y ) z ,\n\nx\uf026 \uf03d\n\n(6)\n\nwhere h can be determined by solving (6) with (4). Comparison of the result with (5)\nprovides\n1/ 2\nA \uf03d B \uf0e9\uf0ea1 \uf0b1 \uf0281 \uf02d B \uf02d2 \uf029 \uf0f9\uf0fa ,\n\uf0eb\n\uf0fb\n59.66\nB\uf03d\n\uf02d 1,\nz\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the minus sign is for trajectories approaching the z-axis (stable manifold), and the\nplus sign is for the trajectories leaving it (unstable manifold). This shows that the local\nstable manifold is a two-dimensional surface forming, with the z-axis, the inset of the\nsaddle point at the origin. Moreover, this result shows that the local stable and unstable\nmanifolds approach the y-axis and x-axis, respectively, as z decreases to zero. A\ntrajectory approaching the z-axis along the stable manifold can only move away along\none branch of the unstable manifold without jumping through the virtual separatrix. The\ncomputed trajectories in figures 3, 4, and 5 display this behavior.\nIt is clear that the stable and unstable manifolds act as virtual separatrices and roughly\ndivide the x-y plane ( Poincare\uf0a2 map) into four quadrants locally near the z-axis. All\nmeaningful trajectories should only travel in the first and third quadrants, but a computed\ntrajectory may mistakenly move into the second and fourth quadrants, two forbidden\nzones, after jumping through the stable manifolds because of numerical errors introduced\nby finite integration time-steps, as shown in Figures 5c and 6c. Such numerical errors\nsubstantially alter the shape of the attractor; this matter will be further discussed in the\nnext section. Once a computed trajectory moves into a forbidden zone, it can return to its\n10\n\n\f\"proper\" track only at the beginning of a period of \"winding\" away from one of the two\nfixed points above the origin and by forming the \"wing of a butterfly.\" Dawson,\nGrebogi, Sauer & Yorke (1994) have pointed out that a continuous shadowing trajectory\ncannot exist for such a trajectory, that is, it is unshadowable.\nThe shortcoming of a discrete numerical method is that it cannot exactly reach a surface\nof zero thickness. It is obvious that one of the two computed trajectories, shown in\nFigures 5 and 6, has passed through the two-dimensional inset of the saddle point at the\norigin, thereby violating the uniqueness theorem. In Figure 6a and 6b, four slightly\ndifferent integration time steps were used. The corresponding computed trajectories\nmoved closer to the z-axis within a circle of radius 10-10. It is interesting to note that the\ntwo computed trajectories (cases A and B), which did not jump through the virtual\nseparatrix, agree with each other, as do the two computed trajectories (cases C and D)\nthat jump through the virtual separatrix and violate the differential equations. However,\nnote that these two sets of computed trajectories are substantially different from each\nother.\nA commonly cited computational example in chaos involves two solutions of slightly\ndifferent initial conditions that remain \"close\" for some time interval and then diverge\nsuddenly. In fact, this behavior is often believed to be a characteristic of chaos. More\nproperly, this phenomenon is actually due to the explosive amplification of numerical\nerrors, and violation of the differential equations noted above.\nBefore closing this section, the essence of explosive amplification of truncation errors,\nwhich may be the origin of homoclinic explosions, is summarized in the following\ntheorem:\nTheorem: Numerical errors can cause a chaotic trajectory of the Lorenz differential\n\nequations to penetrate a separatrix. Since a pseudotrajectory of a chaotic system of nonlinear differential equations can move very close to a separatrix, however small\nnumerical errors introduced by discrete numerical methods can cause the\npseudotrajectory to penetrate the separatrix. This behaviour violates the uniqueness\n\n11\n\n\ftheorem; thus, the trajectory cannot be considered a solution of the Lorenz differential\nequations and is therefore unshadowable.\nProof: The \uf06c-lemma (Palis & de Melo 1982) guarantees that a chaotic trajectory can\nmove closer to the local intersection of stable and unstable manifolds (the z-axis for the\nLorenz system) than any pre-assigned value. Consequently, the trajectory will travel\nthrough the separatrix unless there is zero truncation error.\n5. Lorenz Attractor\nThe lack of convergence in the results of Figures 1 and 3 is, at first glance, unexpected,\nbut is real. Attempts to ignore this behavior frequently rely on the following three\ncommonly believed erroneous arguments. However, they cannot withstand careful\nscrutiny as the remarks provided below show.\nArgument 1: Since a necessary property of chaos is the presence of a positive Liapunov\nexponent, or a positive nonlinear exponential growth-rate, the truncation error introduced\nby various numerical methods can be amplified exponentially. Hence, erroneous\nsolutions develop differently due to different truncation errors. This is equivalent to\nsaying that the finite-difference equations, which approximate the differential equations,\nare unstable. Thus, since convergence requires stability and consistency, convergent\ncomputed results are not achievable. Such unstable cases are shadowable, that is, they\nremain sufficiently close to the true trajectory with slightly different initial conditions.\nHowever, as demonstrated in this paper, Argument 1 is not valid uniformly in the entire\ngeometric space. The breakdown in the numerical solutions for chaos shown in Figures 1\nand 3 is sudden, explosive, and unshadowable, but it is not only due to the exponential\ngrowth of numerical errors associated with an unstable manifold. Even if computed\nresults are shadowable, their statistical properties cannot be determined, implying a\nuseless computation!\nArgument 2: It is well known that chaotic solutions of differential equations are sensitive\nto initial conditions. The different truncation errors associated with different integration\ntime-steps, in effect, lead to a series of modified initial conditions for later times.\n\n12\n\n\fConsequently, computed chaotic solutions are integration time-step dependent, and\ncannot be considered to be an approximate, in any sense, solution of the differential\nequations.\nOn the other hand, as demonstrated before ( Ghosh Moulic & Yao 1996; Yao & Ghosh\nMoulic 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Yao 1999, 2007), stable long-time numerical solutions for\nthe Navier-Stokes equations and the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation are\nsensitive to initial conditions, but are also convergent and independent of the integration\ntime-steps. This shows that a solution sensitive to initial conditions is not necessarily\nsensitive to integration time-steps.\nArgument 3: It is commonly believed that the existence of an attractor guarantees the\nlong-time correctness of numerical computations of chaos, irrespective of the numerical\nerrors that are inevitably present in any computation. Such a concept has never been\nproved, but it is customarily used to support the belief that numerical errors do not\ninvalidate particular computed chaotic results among the community working on\nnumerical solutions of dynamic systems.\nA reason, which often leads researchers to believe that any incorrect computed trajectory\nis acceptable as long as it resides in an attractor, is the attractor's property of being\nrobust. Unfortunately, the true mathematical definition of a robust attractor is less\ndramatic and simply means that an attractor is included in a large attracting open set as\nstated in the section 3; thus, the existence of attractors does not make incorrect\ncomputations become correct! Furthermore, this argument is incorrect because a\ncomputation contaminated by numerical error can escape an existing correct attractor and\ncreate another attractor, which is associated with the incorrect numerical results. This\nwill be discussed below.\nThe locations where numerical errors are amplified can be better discussed within the\nframework of a particular example, the Lorenz attractor. It should be emphasized that I\ndo not have a method to explicitly compute the true Lorenz attractor due to unavoidable\nnumerical errors. I can only determine an erroneous attractor as others have. A\ncomputed Lorenz attractor for \uf044t \uf03d 10\uf02d5 , and the initial condition (1, -1, 10) is used for\n13\n\n\fthe following discussion. The computation is carried out for 108 time-steps, and recorded\nevery 1,000 time-steps. The attractor is constructed using 100,000 points, admittedly\ninsufficient, but there are limitations due to the speed of the available computer.\nThin slices of the computed attractor normal to the z-axis are plotted at four different z\nlocations in Figure 7. A short curve above the attractor shows that the computed\ntrajectory rapidly enters the attractor from its initial location. This is because the attractor\nis robust. The bottom of the attractor looks like a \"thin sheet,\" with the z-axis embedded\nin it, as shown in Figure 7a. For the purpose of demonstration, an expanded cartoon of\nthe computed thin-attractor section of Figure 7a appears in Figure 9. It shows that the\nsize of the attractor section contaminated by numerical errors is twice as large as the\ncorrect one, and its shape is also quite different. This suggests that the effect of\nnumerical errors is by no means small.\nMoving to z = 17.9, the attractor starts to \"split\" near its center and the z-axis is no longer\nembedded in it, as shown in Figure 7b. Above this value of z, the linearized analysis of\nSection 4 is not valid. For even larger values of z, the attractor splits into two parts due\nto the attraction from the two equilibrium points. The two large dots in Figure 7c locate\nthe equilibrium points that no computed trajectory can reach; hence, there are two \"holes\"\nin the computed attractor near the two equilibrium points. In Figures 7 and 8, it is clear\nthat the two-dimensional inset of the saddle at the origin connects the two-dimensional\noutsets of the other two fixed points.\nHigher up, the cross-section of the computed attractor shrinks and finally disappears for z\n> 40. Thin slices of the computed attractor normal to the x-axis are plotted in Figure 8.\nFor small x, the attractor splits into two symmetric parts, which look very much like a\n\"butterfly,\" as is well known, when viewed from other angles. The attractor is very thin\ndue to the strong contraction of the Lorenz equations (Viana 2000; Tucker 2002).\nA single simulation, which is not an acceptable solution according to the present results,\nused to construct a numerical Lorenz attractor indicates that the orbit is dense, and the\ncomputed attractor seems transitive and indecomposable. The plots of Figures 7 and 8\nseem to show that the attractor is finite and closed; hence, it is compact and invariant for\n14\n\n\fa given time step, convincing evidence that it is an attractor satisfying the properties of\nSmale's horseshoe! The plots also show that the computed trajectory visits the edge of\nthe attractor less frequently than its interior, a minor weakness. Since this trajectory is\nsensitive to the initial condition, it is commonly called a strange attractor (Viana 2000;\nGuckenheimer & Holmes 1983). However, recall that computed attractors are also\nsensitive to integration time-steps in that different time-steps result in different computed\nattractors, which all satisfy the mathematical properties of Smale's horseshoe, as\ndemonstrated by Tucker (2002). The conclusion is that none of the attractors generated\nby an algebraic mapping is an acceptable solution of the differential equation even\nthough they all satisfy the property of Smale's horseshoe.\nFurthermore, studies of multiple solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations (Ghosh Moulic\n& Yao 1996; Yao & Ghosh Moulic 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Yao 1999, 2007, 2009) indicate\nthat initial conditions can determine completely different long-time development of flow\npatterns and/or the frequencies and wave numbers of their fluctuations. Those\ncomputational results, convergent and independent of integration time-steps, can be\nobtained only for unstable flows not too far from their critical states, but are sensitive to\ninitial conditions. This implies that large number of attracting open sets exist for\nunstable flows. The open sets can be disjoint or overlapping. The phenomena are\ncertainly complex and different from the description of the simple structure of Smale's\nhorseshoe. The relevance of his horseshoe to differential equations is an open question.\nNo convergent computational results can be found when the Reynolds numbers are much\nlarger than the corresponding critical Reynolds number for unstable flows, a class of fluid\nflows that include turbulent flows. After we attempted to compute many of these flows,\nthe reason for the lack of success became clear: it is impossible to construct a stable\ndiscretized numerical method, which is required by one of Von Neumann's criteria for\nconvergence, without introducing sufficient numerical dumping (numerical viscosity).\nSince the viscous effect is small for large Reynolds number, introducing too much\nnumerical viscosity contravenes the consistency requirement of Von Neumann's\nconvergent criterion.\n\n15\n\n\f6. Conclusion\n\nIt has been demonstrated that attempts to compute numerical solutions of the Lorenz\nequations and their associated statistical properties are contaminated by errors due to the\nuse of a discrete numerical method and finite computer arithmetic. Similar behavior has\nbeen discovered for the R\u00f6ssler equations (Stuart & Humphries, 1996; R\u00f6ssler 2000) and\na particular one-dimensional partial differential equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\nequation (Yao 2007). Reasons for this behavior have been advanced. They suggest that\nnonlinear differential equations are not hyperbolic systems since they have discrete\nsingular points. Each singular point has its own stable and unstable manifolds, which\nmay form one or more virtual separatrices. Truncation errors of numerical computation\nare amplified along the unstable-manifold direction; hence, they violate the Von\nNeumann stability requirement necessary to ensure convergent solutions. The existence\nof a virtual separatrix allows a computed trajectory to \"jump\" through it. Such behavior\nviolates the differential equations. Even in the presence of bounded \"computed results,\"\ntheir convergence should be examined before accepting them as useful numerical\napproximations to the solution of the differential equations. There is no rigorous\nmathematical theory or any existing evidence that supports any other conclusion.\n\nReferences\n\nAbraham R. H. & Shaw C. D. 1992.
