We show that Gorenstein singularities that are cones over singular\nFano varieties provided by so-called flag quivers are smoothable in codimension\nthree. Moreover, we give a precise characterization about the smoothability in\ncodimension three of the Fano variety itself.\n\n1. Introduction\n(1.1)\nQuivers and varieties of quiver representations appear in various places in\nmathematics, see for example [AH]. In [BCKS] it was shown that grassmanians and\npartial flag manifolds have a toric degeneration that can be decribed by a certain\nquiver. This type of quivers can be generalised to what we call flag quivers.\nWe show in this paper that toric Gorenstein singularities X provided by such flag\nquivers Q are smoothable in codimension three,cf. Corollary 33.\nThe idea is to determine their infinitesimal deformation spaces TXk (k = 1, 2): TX1\ndescribes the infinitesimal deformations, and TX2 contains the obstructions for extending deformations to larger base spaces \u2013 see [Lo] for more details. The results\nwill show that all deformations are unobstructed (cf. Theorem 32) and, moreover,\nthat there are enough of them for providing a smoothing in codimension three (cf.\nTheorem 29).\nThe singularities X turn out to be cones over singular Fano varieties P\u2207(Q) . In Theorem 31, we determine the (embedded) infinitesimal deformations of these projective\nvarieties. This yields to a precise characterization of those flag quivers Q leading\nto Fanos P\u2207(Q) which are smoothable in codimension three. The condition is that\nevery so-called simple knot (cf. Definition 26) can be by-passed with a multipath\nconnecting its neighbors, cf. Corollary 33 again.\n(1.2)\nThe paper is organized as follows: In \u00a72 we recall the main facts about\naffine, toric Gorenstein singularities X and their infinitesimal deformation theory.\nIn particular, we show how the modules TXk are linked to certain invariants D k (\u2206)\nof the polytopes \u2206 defining X.\nIn \u00a73, we study mutually dual polytopes \u2207(Q) and \u2206(Q) provided by quivers, i.e.\noriented graphs Q. In the smooth case, i.e. if \u2207(Q) looks like an orthant in a\nneighborhood of every vertex, this has already been done in [AH] to describe the\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKLAUS ALTMANN\n\nDUCO VAN STRATEN\n\nmoduli spaces of representations of the quiver Q. Here, we focus on the singular\ncase.\nAn important technical term is that of the tightness of a quiver Q. This will be\nstudied in \u00a74. Every quiver can be \"tightend\", and this property straightens the\nrelation between Q ant its associated polytopes. In particular, it allows to determine\nall faces of \u2206(Q) with a non-trivial D 1 -invariant. Then, we restrict ourselves to\nthe special case of so-called flag quivers. They are introduced (and their name is\nexplained) in \u00a75. Moreover, we determine their Picard group.\nEventually, \u00a76 deals with the deformation theory of flag quivers. For them, it is\npossible to apply Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, i.e. we can detect all non-vanishing\nD 1 , but prove the vanishing of D 2 for all relevant faces of \u2206(Q). This translates\ninto the lack of obstructions for our singularities X.\n2. Toric Gorenstein singularities\n(2.1)\nLet N, M be two mutually dual free abelian groups of finite rank; denote\nby NR , MR the vector spaces obtained by extending the scalars. Each polyhedral,\nrational cone \u03c3 \u2286 NR with apex in 0 gives rise to an affine, so-called toric variety\nTV(\u03c3, N ) := Spec C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M]. See [Da] for more details.\nThe toric variety TV(\u03c3, N ) is Gorenstein if and only if \u03c3 is the cone over a lattice\npolytope \u2206 sitting in an affine hyperplane of height one in NR , i.e. if there is a\nprimitive R\u2217 \u2208 M such that \u2206 \u2286 [R\u2217 = 1] \u2286 NR . In this situation, we denote\nX\u2206 := TV(\u03c3, N ). The ring A = C [\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M] as well as the modules TXk \u2206 are Mgraded, and the homogeneous pieces TXk \u2206 (\u2212R) with R \u2208 M may be described in\nterms of the polytope \u2206: Consider the complex\n/\n\n0\n0\n\n/\n\nC0\nNC\n/\n\n/\n\nC1\n\n\u000e\n\u2295f0 \u2208\u2206 NC C * f0\n\n/\n\n/\u2295f\n\n1 <\u2206\n\nC2\n\n\u000e\nNC span f\n1\n\nC3\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n...\n\n...\n\nwith fk < \u2206 in the definition of C k+1 running through the k-dimensional faces of\n\u2206; its cohomology is denoted by D k (\u2206) := H k (C \u2022 ). Then, in [AvS] we have shown\nthat\nTheorem 1 ([AvS], (6.6)). Assume that the two-dimensional faces of \u2206 are either squares or triangles with area 1 and 1/2, respectively, i.e. X\u2206 is a conifold in\ncodimension three. Then, if R \u2208 M is any degree, we have for k \u2264 2\n(\n\u0001\nD k \u2206 \u2229 [R = 1] if R \u2264 1 on \u2206\nk\nTX\u2206 (\u2212R) =\n0\notherwise .\nMoreover, the multiplication xs : TXk (\u2212R) \u2192 TXk\u0001 (\u2212(R \u2212 s)) with s \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M is\ninduced from the restriction of D k \u2206 \u2229 [R = 1] to the face \u2206 \u2229 [R \u2212 s = 1] =\n\u2206 \u2229 [R = 1] \u2229 s\u22a5 of \u2206 \u2229 [R = 1].\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n3\n\n(2.2)\nThe vector space D 1 (\u2206) or, to be more exact, a full-dimensional polyhedral cone in it, parametrizes the set of Minkowski summands of the polytope \u2206:\nEach vertex of a Minkowski summand is considered a mutation of an original vertex\nf0 \u2208 \u2206 \u2013 hence it provides an element of the corresponding summand NC /C * f0 of\nC 1 . While it is possible to determine D 1 (\u2206), which leads to TX1 , in many cases, we\nhave to use a vanishing theorem for the D 2 -invariant which is responsible for the\nobstructions. In [AvS] we have proved the following result:\nTheorem 2 ([AvS], (1.1) and (4.7)). Let \u2206 be an n-dimensional, compact, convex\npolytope such that every three-dimensional face is a pyramid (with arbitrary base).\nIf no vertex is contained in more than (n\u22123) two-dimensional, non-triangular faces,\nthen D 2 (\u2206) = 0.\n3. Quiver polytopes\n(3.1)\nLet Q be a connected quiver, i.e. an oriented graph. It consists of a set\nQ0 of vertices, a set Q1 of arrows, and two functions t, h : Q1 \u2192 Q0 assigning to each\narrow \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 its tail t(\u03b1) and head h(\u03b1). This gives rise to the incidence matrix\nInc; it consists of #Q0 rows and #Q1 columns, and for i \u2208 Q0 , \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 we have\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 +1 if i = t(\u03b1)\n\u22121 if i = h(\u03b1)\nInci\u03b1 :=\n\uf8f3\n0 otherwise .\n\nThe associated linear map \u03c0 : ZQ1 \u2192 ZQ0 , \u03c0 : [\u03b1] 7\u2192 [t(\u03b1)] \u2212 [h(\u03b1)] provides an\nexact sequence\n1\ni\n\u03c0\n0 \u2192 IF \u2212\u2192 ZQ1 \u2212\u2192 ZQ0 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2192 0\nwith some free abelian group IF of rank #Q1 \u2212 #Q0 + 1. It is generated by the\nminimal, not necessarily oriented cycles in Q. Denote by IH := ker(ZQ0 \u2192 Z) the\nso-called set of integral weights; it contains a canonical one defined as \u03b8c := \u03c0(1) =\nP\n\u03b1\u2208Q1 \u03c0([\u03b1]).\nDefinition 3. To any weight \u03b8 \u2208 IHR := IH \u2297Z R we associate the so-called flow\npolytope\n1\n\u2207(Q, \u03b8) := \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8) \u2229 RQ\n\u22650 .\nFor non-connected quivers, the flow polytope is defined as the product of the flow\npolytopes associated to the connected components.\nProposition 4. If \u03b8 \u2208 IH is an integral weight, then \u2207(Q, \u03b8) is a lattice polytope.\nProof. (Communicated by G. M. Ziegler) The vertices of \u2207(Q, \u03b8) may be obtained\nas the unique solutions of linear equations with a submatrix of Inc as coefficients\nand integers \u03b8p at the right hand side. On the other hand, square matrices having\n\u00b11 as the only non-trivial entries with each of them occuring at most once in each\ncolumn can only have determinant \u00b11 or 0:\nIf every column contains both 1 and \u22121, then the rows add up to zero. Otherwise,\n\n\f4\n\nKLAUS ALTMANN\n\nDUCO VAN STRATEN\n\nthere is a column having only one single non-trivial entry \u00b11 \u2013 and we use exactly\nthis one to develop our determinant and end up with a smaller matrix.\n\u0003\n(3.2)\nThere are two weights being of special interest:\n(i) The canonical weight \u03b8c := \u03c0(1); we set \u2207(Q) := \u2207(Q, \u03b8c ). The shifted\npolytope \u2207(Q) \u2212 1 = IFR \u2229 {r \u2208 RQ1 | r\u03b1 \u2265 \u22121} contains 0 as an interior\nlattice point. This makes it possible to define the dual polytope as\n\b\n\u2207(Q)\u2228 := a \u2208 IFR\u2217 a, \u2207(Q) \u2212 1 \u2265 \u22121 .\n\n\u2207(Q)\u2228 \u2286 IFR\u2217 is the smallest polytope containing 0 \u2208 IF \u2217 and the so-called\nquiver polytope\n\b\n\u2206(Q) := conv a\u03b1 := i\u2217 ([\u03b1]) \u2208 IF \u2217 \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 .\n\nIn particular, both \u2207(Q)\u2228 and \u2206(Q) are compact lattice polytopes.\n\n(ii) The zero weight \u03b8 := 0. Then, \u2207(Q, 0) \u2286 IF is a polyhedral cone with apex;\nit is the dual cone of R\u22650 * \u2207(Q)\u2228 = R\u22650 * \u2206(Q). Moreover, \u2207(Q, 0) occurs\nas the \"tail cone\" (cone of unbounded directions) \u2207(Q, 0) = \u2207(Q, \u03b8)\u221e for\nevery weight \u03b8 \u2208 IHR .\nThe quiver Q lacks oriented cycles if and only if\n\u2207(Q, 0) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2207(Q) is compact \u21d0\u21d2 0 \u2208 int \u2207(Q)\u2228 \u21d0\u21d2 0 \u2208 int \u2206(Q).\nIf this is the case, then \u2206(Q) = \u2207(Q)\u2228 is a reflexive polytope in the sense of Batyrev,\ncf. [Ba]. The corresponding affine toric\u0001 Gorenstein singularity X\u2206(Q) := TV(\u03c3, N )\nwith N := IF \u2217 \u2295Z and \u03c3 := cone \u2206(Q) \u2286 NR will be our main subject of investigation; it equals the cone over the projective toric variety P\u2207(Q) := TV(N (\u2207(Q)), IF \u2217)\nwith N (\u2207(Q)) denoting the normal fan of \u2207(Q).\nExample 5.

In particular, since D 1 and D 2 of\nan octahedron is 0 and C2 , respectively, Theorem 1 implies that X\u2206(Q) is rigid, but\nTX2 = T 2 (\u2212R\u2217 ) is two-dimensional. The singularity X\u2206(Q) is well known; its equations are the 2-minors of a general (2 \u00d7 3)-determinant. It illustrates the disappointing fact that TX2 might contain more than just the obstructions, cf. Remark (6.5).\n(3.3)\nBy a subquiver P \u2286 Q we mean a quiver P with P0 = Q0 and P1 \u2286 Q1 . It\nis not assumed to be connected; in particular there might even occur isolated\nP points\np \u2208 P0 . Fixing a weight \u03b8 \u2208 IHR , we will use the abbreviation \u03b8(S) := p\u2208S \u03b8p for\nsubsets S \u2286 Q0 .\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n5\n\nDefinition 6. Let \u03b8 \u2208 IHR be a weight of Q. A subquiver P \u2286 Q is said to be\n\u2022 \u03b8-(semi-) stable (cf. [Ki]) if any non-trivial, proper subset S \u2282 P0 that is\nclosed under P -successors fulfills \u03b8(S) < 0 (or \u2264 0, respectively);\n\u2022 \u03b8-polystable if the connected components P v of P , meant as connected quivers\nwith a possibly smaller set P0v \u2286 Q0 , fulfill \u03b8(P0v ) = 0 and, moreover, are\n\u03b8-stable.\nWhile these notions where defined in [Ki] to obtain decent moduli spaces of quiver\nrepresentations, we will just use them to describe the faces of our quiver polytopes.\nLemma 7.\n(1) \"Stable\" =\u21d2 \"polystable\" =\u21d2 \"semistable\".\n(2) Stable quivers are always connected. Semistability of P implies \u03b8(P0v ) = 0\nfor its connected components.\n(3) The notions \"stability\" and \"semistability\" are closed under enlargement of\nthe subquiver P \u2286 Q; \"polystability\" is not.\n(4) A subquiver P \u2286 Q is polystable if and only if \u2207(P, \u03b8) contains a point with\npositive coordinates, i.e. if the set \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8) \u2229 RP>01 is non-empty.\n(5) A subquiver P \u2286 Q is semistable if and only if \u2207(P, \u03b8) 6= \u2205.\n(6) Every semistable subquiver P \u2286 Q contains a (unique) maximal polystable\nsubquiver P\u0304 \u2286 P .\nProof. The first two parts are straightforward. Claim (3) follows from the easy fact\nthat the larger P \u2286 Q, the more difficult is it for S \u2282 Q0 to be closed under P successors. However, the corresponding property fails for \"polystability\", since any\nenlargement of P \u2286 Q may unify connected components.\nTo see that the condition in (4) suffices for polystability, let S \u2286 Q0 be an arbitrary\nsubset. We may use any r \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8) to calculate \u03b8(S) as\nX\nX\n\u03b8(S) =\nr\u03b1 \u2212\nr\u03b1 .\n\u03b1\n\nS \u2192(Q0 \\S)\n\n\u03b1\n\n(Q0 \\S)\u2192S\n\nNow, if r \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8) \u2229 RP1 and S is closed under P -successors, then the first sum is\nvoid. However, if S is not a union of connected components of P , then there must\nbe at least one P -arrow connecting Q0 \\ S and S, i.e. contributing to the second\nsum. In particular, if r has only positive coordinates, then \u03b8(S) < 0.\nFor proving the necessity of the condition, we may assume that P = Q is \u03b8-stable.\n1\nIf \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8) \u2229 RQ\n>0 = \u2205, then the vector \u03b8 = (\u03b8p )p\u2208Q0 may not be written as a positive\nlinear combination of the columns of the incidence matrix Inc introduced in (3.1).\nThus, duality in convex geometry provides the existence of a non-trivial vector\nh \u2208 RQ0 /(R * 1) such that hh, Inc(\u2022,\u03b1) i \u2265 0 for every arrow \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 , but hh, \u03b8i \u2264 0.\nThe first property means ht(\u03b1) \u2265 hh(\u03b1) . Hence, denoting by c1 < * * * < ck (k \u2265 2)\nthe values of h on Q0 and choosing an arbitrary c0 < c1 , the subsets\nSv := {p \u2208 Q0 | hp \u2264 cv } \u2282 Q0\n\n(v = 0, . . . , k)\n\n\f6\n\nKLAUS ALTMANN\n\nDUCO VAN STRATEN\n\nare closed under successors. In particular, by the stability of Q, we obtain \u03b8(Sv ) < 0\nfor v = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 and \u03b8(S0 ) = \u03b8(Sk ) = 0. This yields a contradiction via\n0 <\n\nk\u22121\nX\nv=1\n\n(cv \u2212 cv+1 ) \u03b8(Sv ) =\n\nk\nX\n\ncv * \u03b8(Sv \\ Sv\u22121 ) =\n\nv=1\n\nX\n\nhp \u03b8p \u2264 0 .\n\np\u2208Q0\n\nFinally, we have to show (5) and (6). First, if P \u2286 Q is a subquiver with \u2207(P, \u03b8) 6= \u2205,\nthen we may choose an element r \u2208 \u2207(P, \u03b8) with maximal support P\u03041 := {\u03b1 \u2208\nP1 | r\u03b1 > 0}. Hence, by (4), the corresponding subquiver P\u0304 is polystable and, using\n(1) and (3), P must be semistable.\nIt remains to check that \u2207(P, \u03b8) 6= \u2205 for semistable P \u2286 Q. We do this by copying\nthe second part of the proof of (4) with minor changes: The stronger condition\n1\n\u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8)\u2229RQ\n\u22650 = \u2205 implies the existence of an h satisfying the strict inequality hh, \u03b8i <\n0. On the other hand, if Q is semistable, we have only sv \u2265 0. Nevertheless, one\nobtains the same contradiction.\n\u0003\nCorollary 8. For a subquiver P \u2286 Q, we realize its flow polytope as the subset\n\b\n/P .\n\u2207(P, \u03b8) = r \u2208 \u2207(Q, \u03b8) r\u03b1 = 0 if \u03b1 \u2208\n\nThis provides an order preserving bijection between the poset of \u03b8-polystable subquivers, on the one hand, and the face lattice of \u2207(Q, \u03b8), on the other. In partic\u0001\nular, since the dimension of \u2207(P, \u03b8) is #P1 \u2212 #Q0 + #(components of P ) , the\n\u03b8-polystable trees yield the vertices of \u2207(Q, \u03b8).\nProof. Every face of \u2207(Q, \u03b8) is of the form f = {r \u2208 \u2207(Q, \u03b8) | r\u03b1i = 0 , i = 1, . . . , k}\nfor some edges \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k \u2208 Q1 . Assuming that the set {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k } is maximal for\nthe given face f , we obtain P by P1 := Q1 \\ {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k }.\n\u0003\n(3.4)\nEvery connected quiver Q is stable with respect to its canonical weight\nc\n\u03b8 . In this situation, we had defined in (3.2) the polytopes \u2206(Q) \u2286 \u2207(Q)\u2228 . In\ngeneral, under the dualization \u2207\u2228 := {a | ha, \u2207i \u2265 \u22121} of polytopes containing the\norigin, we obtain an anti-isomorphism of the posets\n\u03a6 : {faces of \u2207 without 0}\nf \u001f\n\n\u223c\n\n/\n\n{faces of \u2207\u2228 without 0}\n/ {a \u2208 \u2207\u2228 | ha, f i = \u22121}.\n\nNote that faces containing 0 correspond to faces of the dual tail cone \u2013 this gives a\nkind of a continuation of \u03a6. If, e.g., f \u2264 \u2207 is as above and [0, f ] \u2264 \u2207 denotes the\nsmallest face containing 0 and f , then \u03a6([0, f ]) is the tail cone of \u03a6(f ) \u2264 \u2207\u2228 .\nApplying this to \u2207 := \u2207(Q) \u2212 1, we obtain for every \u03b8c -polystable subquiver P \u2286 Q\nthe face\n\u0001\n\b\nc\nF P, \u2206(Q) := \u03a6(\u2207(P, \u03b8Q\n)) = conv a\u03b1 \u2208 IF \u2217 \u03b1 \u2208\n/P .\n\u0001\nSince F P, \u2206(Q) does not contain 0, it is also a face of the quiver polytope \u2206(Q).\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\nExample 9.

For any subquiver P \u2286 Q we define a quiver \u0393Q (P ). Its vertices\n\u0393Q (P )0 are the connected components of P , and the arrows are defined as \u0393Q (P )1 :=\nQ1 \\ P1 . Every weight \u03b8 on Q induces a weight \u03b8 on \u0393Q (P ) with \u03b8c staying the\ncanonical weight. If P was \u03b8-polystable, then \u03b8 turns into the 0-weight on \u0393Q (P ).\nProposition 11. Let P < Q be a non-empty, \u03b8c -polystable subquiver.\nThen, the\n\u0001\nface F (P, \u2206(Q))\n<\n\u2206(Q)\nequals\nthe\nquiver\npolytope\n\u2206\n\u0393\n(P\n)\nand\nhas\ndimension\nQ\n\u0001\n#\u03931 \u2212 #\u03930 . Moreover, it is contained in a plane of IF \u2217 having lattice distance one\nfrom the origin.\nProof. Note that \u03b8c = 0 in \u0393Q (P ).

The part concerning\nthe height is a consequence of the fact that the faces of \u2207(Q)\u2228 are contained in affine\nhyperplanes [r = \u22121] \u2286 IF \u2217 for certain vertices r \u2208 \u2207(Q) \u2212 1.

Tightness\n(4.1)\nTo ensure that there is a one-to-one correspondence between arrows\n\u03b1 \u2208 Q1 , on the one hand, and facets \u2207(Q \\ \u03b1, \u03b8) of \u2207(Q, \u03b8), on the other, we need\nthe notion of tightness. In particular, if Q is \u03b8c -tight, then a\u03b1 \u2208 IF \u2217 will be the\nmutually distinct vertices of \u2206(Q).\nDefinition 12. If \u03b8 \u2208 IH is an integral weight, then the quiver Q is called \u03b8-tight if\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 the subquiver Q \\ \u03b1 is \u03b8-stable.\nLemma 13.\n(1) Let \u03b8 \u2208 IH such that Q is \u03b8-stable. By contraction of certain arrows in Q, the weight \u03b8 becomes tight without changing the polytope\n\u2207(Q, \u03b8). Moreover, the canonical weight \u03b8c may be tightened in such a way\nthat not only the polytope \u2207(Q, \u03b8c ), but also \u2207(Q, \u03b8) remains untouched.\n(2) Assume that Q is \u03b8-tight. If P \u2286 Q is a \u03b8-polystable subquiver, then, \u0393Q (P )\nbecomes 0-tight.\n(3) Let \u0393 be a 0-tight quiver with #\u03930 \u2265 2. Then, not counting the loops, every\nknot of \u0393 has at least two in- and outgoing arrows, respectively. In particular,\n#\u03931 \u2265 2 #\u03930 + #(loops of \u0393).\nProof. (1) If Q \\ {\u03b1} is not \u03b8-stable, then there exists a subset S \u2282 Q0 that is, up\nto \u03b1, closed under successors and satisfies \u03b8(S) \u2265 0. Let \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2l be the arrows\npointing from Q0 \\ S to S; since Q is \u03b8-stable, \u03b1 leads in the opposite direction.\n\u271b\u2718\n\n\u03b1\n\nS 2\n\u2768\n\u271a\u2719\n6\n\n\u03b2i\n\n\u271b\u2718\n\u2732\nQ0 \\S\n\n\u271a\u2719\n\nP\nP\nIf r \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8), then r\u03b1 =\ni r\u03b2i + \u03b8(S) \u2265\ni r\u03b2i . Hence, the relations r\u03b2i \u2265 0\n\u22121\ntogether with the \u03c0 (\u03b8)-equations force that r\u03b1 \u2265 0. In particular, we may contract\n\u03b1 without changing the polytope \u2207(Q, \u03b8) (including its lattice structure).\nTightening \u03b8c , we obtain 1 \u2212 l = \u03b8c (S) \u2265 0. In case of l = 0, the \u03b8-stability of Q\nimplies that \u03b8(S) > 0. In particular, contracting \u03b1 does not change neither \u2207(Q, \u03b8c ),\nnor \u2207(Q, \u03b8). If l = 1, then the situation is symmetric with \u03b8c (S) = 0. Depending\non whether \u03b8(S) \u2265 0 or \u03b8(S) \u2264 0, we should contract \u03b1 or \u03b21 , respectively.\n(2) Let \u03b1 \u2208 \u03931 = Q1 \\ \u22061 . Then, the connectivity of Q \\ \u03b1 implies the connectivity\nof \u0393 \\ \u03b1. Moreover, projecting any positive r \u2208 \u2207(Q \\ \u03b1, \u03b8) along the forgetful\nmap ZQ1 \u2192 Z\u03931 (see the diagram of the proof of Proposition 11), provides an\nr \u2208 \u2207(\u0393 \\ \u03b1, 0) with positive entries.\n(3) For every \u03b1 \u2208 \u03931 , non-trivial subsets S \u2286 \u03930 cannot be closed under (\u0393 \\ \u03b1)successors. Hence, there is always a \u03b2 \u2208 \u03931 \\ \u03b1 leaving S. Now, the claim follows\nfrom applying this fact to the cases #S = 1 or #(\u03930 \\ S) = 1.\n\u0003\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n9\n\n(4.2)\nIf Q has no oriented cycles, then \u2206(Q) = \u2207(Q)\u2228 , and Proposition 11\nyields all its faces \u2013 they equal \u2206(\u0393) with \u0393 = \u0393Q (P ) for \u03b8c -polystable subquivers\nP \u2264 Q. Moreover, Q and hence \u0393 maybe assumed to be \u03b8c -tight. In particular,\n#\u03931 \u2265 2 #\u03930 + #(loops of \u0393).\nUsing this, we are now classifying all possible faces of those polytopes \u2206(Q) up to\ndimension three. Note that \u03b8c = 0 in \u0393.\nDimension one: \u0393 consists of one vertex with two loops. The corresponding polytope \u2206(\u0393) is a lattice interval of length one.\nDimension two: The case #\u03930 = 1 yields the triple loop with \u2206(\u0393) being the\nstandard triangle. On the other hand, there is only one quiver with \u03b8c (\u0393) \u2261 0 that\nconsists of two vertices, four arrows, but no loops:\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\n\u2766\u271b\n\u271b\n\n\u2766\n\n\u0393dbl (2) = \u0393opp (2)\n\nThe corresponding polytope \u2206(\u0393) is the unit square.\nDimension three: The case #\u03930 \u2264 2 yields the quivers of the previous list with one\nadditional loop. Adding a loop to \u0393 corresponds to taking the pyramid of height 1\nover the corresponding polytope \u2206(\u0393). In particular, we obtain the unit tetrahedron\nand the pyramid over the unit square.\nOn the other hand, there are two different quivers involving three vertices and six\nedges:\n\u2761\n\n\u276a\n\u2721\u2721 \u274f\n\u0393\n\u276a\u274f\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2721\u2721\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2721\u2721\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2721\u2721\n\u2722\u2721\n\u2721\n\u2722\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2732\n\u2761\n\u2732 \u2761\n\ndbl\n\n(3)\n\n\u2761\n\n\u2721\n\u2723\u2721 \u274f\n\u0393opp (3)\n\u276a\u274f\n\u2721\n\u274f\n\u274f\n\u2721\n\u2721\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2721\n\u2721\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2721\n\u274f\n\u276b\n\u2721\u2721\n\u2722\n\u2732\u274f \u2761\n\u2761\u271b\n\nThe first quiver provides an octahedron.

On the other hand, the knots being touched by b express\n(ai+1 \u2212ai ) as an element of the vector space associated to the affine space A spanned\nby \u2206(\u0393\u0304). In particular, \u2206(\u0393\u0304) is a face of \u2206(\u0393) and, moreover, the remaining vertices\na1 , . . . , ak are contained in an affine plane being parallel to A; they form their own\nface B := conv{a1 , . . . , ak }.\n\u0001\nLet t \u2208 D 1 \u2206(\u0393) \u2013 here we think of it as a tuple of dilatation factors for every\ncompact edge of \u2206(\u0393): The factors arise after applying the differential d1 : C 1 \u2192 C 2\nfrom (2.1); since it yields 0, all the components of the image must be contained in\nthe subspaces span f1 .\nSince all vertical edges connecting \u2206(\u0393\u0304) and B have the same dilatation factor, we\nmay assume these factors to be zero. Now, if p(t) = 0, then the dilatation factors\ninside \u2206(\u0393\u0304) are also mutually equal; it remains to show that they vanish. If not,\nthen we get a map\n{a1 , . . . , ak } \u2212\u2192 {vertices of \u2206(\u0393\u0304)}\nassigning ai the only vertex a \u2208 \u2206(\u0393\u0304) such that aai is an edge of \u2206(\u0393). Since this\nmap is obviously surjective, we obtain\n#\u0393\u03041 \u2264 k = #b.\nHence, \u0393 equals b with an additional arrow leaving and reaching each knot.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 17. Let Q be a \u03b8c -tight quiver without oriented cycles. Then, the only\nproper, k-dimensional faces F (P, \u2206(Q)) of \u2206(Q) having a non-trivial D 1 are those\nwith \u0393Q (P ) \u223c\n= \u0393opp (k).\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n11\n\nProof. Let \u0393 := \u0393Q (P ). In the proof of the previous lemma we have seen that the\nexistence of a loop, i.e. of a cycle of length 1, implies that \u2206(\u0393) is a pyramid over\n\u2206(\u0393\u0304). In particular, it has a trivial D 1 .\nOn the other hand, via a successive contraction of simple cycles of length ki \u2265 2,\nwe can produce a sequence of quivers, beginning with \u0393, such that\n\u2022 we avoid the contraction of ki -cycles in quivers isomorphic to \u0393(ki , \u03c0), and\n\u2022 we end with either the existence of loops or with a quiver isomorphic to some\n\u0393dbl (m). The latter leads to a non-trivial D 1 only for m = 2.\n\u0001\n1\nBy Lemma 16(2),\nthis\nsequence\nrepresents\nD\n\u2206(\u0393)\nas a subset of either 0 or\n\u0001\n1\ndbl\nD \u2206(\u0393 (2)) = C. On the other hand, if the contraction of a simple ki -cycle\nleads from \u0393i to \u0393i+1 , then\ni\n#(\u0393i+1\n0 ) = #(\u03930 ) \u2212 (ki \u2212 1)\n\nand\n\ni\n#(\u0393i+1\n1 ) = #(\u03931 ) \u2212 ki .\n\nIn particular, relations like #(\u0393i1 ) \u2265 2 #(\u0393i0 ) or #(\u0393i1 ) > 2 #(\u0393i0 ) will be inherited\nfrom \u0393i to \u0393i+1 . If ki \u2265 3, then the weak inequality for \u0393i does even imply the\nstrict one for \u0393i+1 . Thus, if our sequence ends with \u0393dbl (2), only 2-cycles have been\n\u0003\ncontracted successively from \u0393. This enforces that \u0393 \u223c\n= \u0393opp (k).\n5. Flag Quivers\n(5.1)\nFirst, we will describe the classes of Weil and Cartier divisors on the projective variety P\u2207(Q,\u03b8) provided by a general quiver Q with weight \u03b8 \u2208 IH. Assume,\nw.l.o.g., that Q is \u03b8-tight. We introduce the notation\nT \u03b8 (Q) := {\u03b8-polystable trees T < Q}.\nT\nThe tightness of Q implies that T \u03b8 (Q) = \u2205. For T \u2208 T \u03b8 (Q), or more general for\nany \u03b8-polystable subquiver P < Q, we may define\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nP -comp deg\nIH(P ) := IH \u0393Q (P ) = ker Z\n\u2212\u2192 Z\nwith IH and \u0393Q (P ) as mentioned in (3.1) and Definition 10, respectively.\n\nProposition 18. The class group DivCl (P\u2207(Q,\u03b8)) of Weil divisors equals IH.\nProof. Equivariant Weil divisors correspond to maps N (1) \u2192 Z with N denoting the\ninner normal fan N (\u2207(Q, \u03b8)) of \u2207(Q, \u03b8) \u2286 IFR . Since the elements of N (1) encode\nthe facets of \u2207(Q, \u03b8), i.e. the \u03b8-polystable subquivers Q \\ \u03b1, the equivariant Weil\ndivisors may be written as elements of ZQ1 .\nOn the other hand, as being well known in the theory of toric varieties, the principal\ndivisors among the equivariant ones are given by IF \u2286 ZQ1 . Hence, the claim follows\nfrom\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u000e\ndeg\nZQ1 IF = im ZQ1 \u2192 ZQ0 = ker ZQ0 \u2212\u2192\nZ = IH .\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nKLAUS ALTMANN\n\nDUCO VAN STRATEN\n\n(5.2)\nUsing the fact that divisors on a toric variety are locally principal if and\nonly if they are principal on the equivariant affine charts, we obtain a description of\nPic (P\u2207(Q,\u03b8) ) as well.\nProposition 19. The Picard group Pic (P\u2207(Q,\u03b8) ) of the projective toric variety P\u2207(Q,\u03b8)\nequals\n\u0010\n\u0011\nPic (P\u2207(Q,\u03b8) ) = ker IH \u2192 \u2295T \u2208T \u03b8 IH(T ) .\nProof. An element g \u2208 ZQ1 represents a Cartier divisor if and only if g induces\nprincipal divisors\u0001 on the affine charts TV(\u03b4(T )) with \u03b4(T ) := ha\u03b1 \u2208 IF \u2217 | \u03b1 \u2208\n/\n\u03b8\nT i \u2208 N \u2207(Q, \u03b8) for every \u03b8-polystable tree T \u2208 T . This condition is equivalent\nto g \u2208 ZT1 + IF \u2286 ZQ1 . Adapting the commutative diagram from the proof of\nProposition 11, we obtain\n0\n0\n\u000f\n\n0\n\n/\n\nT1\n\nZ\n\n\u000f\n/\n\n\u2229 IF\n\nT1\n\nZ\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\n/\n\n0\n\nIF\n\n/\n\nZ\n\n/\n\n/\n\nZ\u03931\n\n/\n\n0\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nIF (\u0393)\n\nIH\nsum\n\nforget\n\n\u000f\n\n0\n\n/\n\nQ1\n\n/\n\nIH(T )\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n/\n\n0\n\nIt implies that the membership g \u2208 ZT1 + IF translates into the fact that the class\n\u1e21 \u2208 IH maps to 0 \u2208 IH(T ).\n\u0003\n\b \u2032\n\u03b8 \u2208 IH \u03b8\u2032 (S) = 0 for S \u2286 Q0 with \u03b8(S) = 0\nand Q|S and Q|(Q0 \\S) being \u03b8-semistable .\nIn particular,\nbut only on \u03b8 \u2208 IH depending condition for Pic (P\u2207(Q,\u03b8) ) \u223c\n=\n\b \u2032 a necessary,\n\u2032\nZ is that \u03b8 \u2208 IHR | \u03b8 (S) = 0 for S \u2286 Q0 with \u03b8(S) = 0 = R * \u03b8 .\n\nCorollary 20. Pic (P\u2207(Q,\u03b8) ) =\n\n(5.3)\nNow, we turn to the main point of this section \u2013 the introduction of the\nso-called flag quivers. They will allow an easy description of their Picard group as\nwell as, in \u00a76, of their deformation theory.\nDefinition 21. A quiver Q without oriented cycles is called a flag quiver if\n(i) there is exactly one source p0 \u2208 Q0 with m := \u03b8c (p0 ),\n(ii) there are sinks p1 , . . . , pl with mi := \u2212\u03b8c (pi ) \u2265 2, and\n(iii) the canonical weight vanishes on the remaining knots, i.e. on Q0 \\{p0 , . . . , pl }.\nP\nIn particular, we have m = li=1 mi .\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n13\n\nRemark. The condition \"mi \u2265 2\" may be explained as follows: If mi = 1, then Q\ncannot be tight, cf. Lemma 22. Moreover, tightening would mean to contract the\narrow pointing to pi , hence to create a non-sink with negative weight.\n(5.4)\nThe name \"flag quiver\" arises from the following example from [BCKS]:\nPi\nFor positive integers k1 , . . . , kl+1, we set ni :=\nv=1 kv and n := nl+1 . Then, a\nquiver Q(n1 , . . . , nl , n) may be defined via an (n \u00d7 n)-ladder-box containing the\n(ki \u00d7 ki )-squares on the main diagonal. As depicted in the middle figure below, Q0\nconsists of the interior lattice points in the region below the small squares and of\nthe closures of the (l + 1) connected components of the part of the boundary of this\nregion that avoids the south west corners of the (ki \u00d7 ki )-squares. As arrows we take\nall possibilities pointing eastbound and northbound.\n\nk2\n\u2217\n\u2022\u2744\u2732\u2022 \u2732\u2022\n\u2022\u2744\u2732\u2022\u2744\u2732\u2022\u2744\u2732\u2217\n\n\u2732\n\nk1\n\n\u273b \u273b \u273b\n\u2732\u2022 \u2732\u2022 \u2732\n\u273b \u273b \u273b\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2732\n\u2732\u2022\n\n\u2732\n\u2732\u2022\n\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\u2022\n\nquiver Q(2, 5)\n\nIn [BCKS], the authors have originally considered Q\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl , n) as depicted in\nthe left figure above: It is a kind of a dual quiver; its ordinary vertices correspond to\nthe boxes instead of the lattice points, and there are additional, exeptional, vertices\ncalled \"\u2217\" sitting in the south west corners of the (ki \u00d7 ki )-squares. Nevertheless, it\nwas shown that the corresponding X\u2206(Q) equals the cone over a projective toric variety being a degeneration of the flag manifold Flag(n1 , . . . , nl , n). The polytopes assigned to the quiver Q(n1 , . . . , nl , n) are called \u2207(n1 , . . . , nl , n) and \u2206(n1 , . . . , nl , n),\nrespectively.\n(5.5)\nThe polystability of subquivers has an easy meaning in the special case\nof flag quivers:\nLemma 22. Let Q be a flag quiver. P \u2286 Q is \u03b8c -polystable iff it is a union of\npaths leading from p0 to every sink pi (i = 1, . . . , l). Moreover, Q is tight if and\nonly if there are no verices with only one in- and outgoing arrow, respectively. In\nparticular, tightening preserves the property of being a flag quiver.\nProof. Both the criterion for polystability and the neccessity of the tightness condition for Q are clear.\nOn the other hand, assume that Q satisfies this condition and let \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 be an\narbitrary arrow. We may choose paths r v leading from p0 to pv , but avoiding \u03b1.\nMoreover, for any \u03b2 6= \u03b1 there is a special path s(\u03b2) which, additionally, touches \u03b2;\n\n\f14\n\nKLAUS ALTMANN\n\nDUCO VAN STRATEN\n\nlet p\u03bc(\u03b2) be the sink reached by s(\u03b2). Then, with\n\u0010S\n\u0011\nv\nR(\u03b2) := s(\u03b2) \u222a\nr\nv6=\u03bc(\u03b2)\n\nwe have obtained a union\nS of paths encoding a polystable subquiver containing \u03b2, but\nnot \u03b1. In particular, \u03b26=\u03b1 R(\u03b2) shows the polystability of the quiver P = Q\\ \u03b1. \u0003\nTight flag quivers may be visualized as a so-called fence, i.e. as a system of mutually\nintersecting ropes leading from the l different ceilings p1 , . . . , pl to the only base\np0 . The intersections correspond to the knots b \u2208 Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl }. If, moreover,\nthe quiver is a plane one, then, by Corollary 8, the dimension of the corresponding\npolytopes \u2207(Q) and \u2206(Q) may be read of the plane fenceas the number of compact\nregions.\nExample 23. Here, we present three fences of dimensions six, five, and again five.\np1\n\np1\nb\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745b\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\nc\na\n\np0\n\np0\n\nQ2\n\nQ1\n\nQ(2, 5)\n\n(5.6)\nAssume that Q is a tight flag quiver. Denoting by B \u2286 Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl }\nthe set of blocking knots, i.e. those that are not avoidable in a set of paths leading\nfrom p0 to each of the ends p1 , . . . , pl , respectively, the Picard number of P\u2207(Q) will\nbe #(B) + l. More precisely, we obtain\n\u0001\ndeg\n0\nl\nProposition 24. Pic (P\u2207(Q) ) = ker Z{p ,...,p }\u222aB \u2212\u2192 Z .\nProof. The \u03b8c -polystable subquivers are the unions of paths leading from p0 to\n{p1 , . . . , pl }. In particular, if \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 Pic (P\u2207(Q) ), then \u03b8\u2032 (b) = 0 for vertices b \u2208\n/\n0\nl\n{p , . . . , p } \u222a B. On the other hand, since for each S as in Corollary (5.2) either S\nor Q0 \\ S contains {p0 , . . . , pl } \u222a B, this remains the only condition.\n\u0003\nExample 25.\n\n\u2708\n\n\u2732 \u275c\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\u2732 \u275c\n\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\nt\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\u2732 \u275c\u275e\n\n\u2732\n\u2732 t\n\n\u2207(2, 5) \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 with Picard number 3\n\nKnots x \u2208 B give rise to a decomposition of Q into a join of smaller quivers, meaning\nthat P\u2207(Q) splits into a product of projective varieties.\n6. Deformation theory of flag quivers\n(6.1)\nLet Q be a tight flag quiver. From Theorem 1 and Corollary 14 we know\nthat the module TX1 of infinitesimal deformations of X\u2206(Q) = Cone(P\u2207(Q) ) is built\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n15\n\nfrom the spaces of Minkowski summands D 1 (F ) of the faces F \u2264 \u2206(Q). These\nfaces look like F (P, \u2206(Q)) = \u2206(\u0393Q (P )) for \u03b8c -polystable subquivers P \u2264 Q, and,\nby Proposition 17, \u0393Q (P ) must be isomorphic to \u0393opp (k) to yield a non-trivial D 1 .\nOn the other hand, in the special case of flag quivers, Lemma 22 provides an explicit\ndescription of the \u03b8c -polystable subquivers at all. Combining all this information,\nwe will get a complete description of TX1 .\nDefinition 26. A knot b \u2208 Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl } in a tight flag quiver is called simple if\n\u2022 b is of valence four, i.e. supporting exactly two pairs of in- and outgoing\narrows, respectively, and\n\u2022 besides b, both pairs do neither have a common tail or head of valence four\nin the set Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl }, neither a common head pi with mi = 2, nor the\ncommon tail p0 with m = 2.\nVisualizing Q as a fence, then simple knots correspond to the simple crossings of\ntwo ropes that are not adjacent to a further simple crossing of the same two ropes.\nExample 23 (continued). In the first two quivers Q(2, 5) and Q1 of Example 23,\nevery knot of Q \\ {p0 , p1 } is simple. On the other hand, in Q2 , only b shares this\nproperty. The remaining two knots provide for each other the reason to violate the\ncondition described in the previous definition.\nProposition 27. Let Q be a tight flag quiver with dim \u2206(Q) \u2265 3. Then, the\nonly faces F \u2264 \u2206(Q) admitting a non-trivial Minkowsi decomposition are the twodimensional squares F (Q \\ b) with b being a simple knot.\n(Q \\ b \u2286 Q denotes the subquiver obtained by erasing the four arrows containing b.)\nProof. First, we consider the proper faces of \u2206(Q). Lemma 22 tells us that \u03b8c polystable subquivers P consist of one major component and a bunch of isolated\nknots from Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl }. On the other hand, the only quivers providing a nontrivial D 1 are \u0393opp (k). If \u0393Q (P ) = \u0393opp (k) with k \u2265 3, then Q would have to contain\noriented cycles. Thus, P = Q \\ {b} for some knot b.\nDenote by \u03b11 , \u03b12 and \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 the pairs of in- and outgoing b-arrows, respectively.\nAssuming that, for instance, \u03b11 and \u03b12 had a common tail c \u2208 Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl } of\nvalence four, then the two arrows having c as common head could not occur in paths\navoiding b and leading from p0 to {p1 , . . . , pl }. In particular, P = Q \\ {b} would not\nbe stable. The reversed implication may be shown along the lines of the proof of\nLemma 22.\nIt remains to deal with the polytope \u2206(Q) itself. If dim \u2206(Q) \u2265 4, then we have just\nshown that every facet is Minkowski prime; this implies the same property for \u2206(Q),\ntoo. The three-dimensional case can be easily solved by a complete classification. \u0003\nCorollary 28. For X\u2206(Q) , the non-trivial TX1 (\u2212R) are one-dimensional, and they\narise from degrees R = R(b) such that R(b) \u2264 1 on \u2206(Q) and R(b) = 1 exactly on\nF (Q \\ b) with b being a simple knot.\n\n\f16\n\nKLAUS ALTMANN\n\nDUCO VAN STRATEN\n\n(6.2)\nThe precise description of TX1 given in Corollary 28 may be supplemented\nby the following, more structural claim.\nTheorem 29. Let X\u2206(Q) be the toric Gorenstein singularity assigned to the quiver\npolytope of a flag quiver Q. Then, the simple knots b \u2208 Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl } parametrize\nthe 3-codimensional A1 -strata Z(b) \u001f\ndeformations of X\u2206(Q) equals\nTX1 =\n\n\u007f\n\nL\n\ni(b)\n\nb\n\n/\n\nX\u2206(Q) , and the module of the infinitesimal\n\n\u22121\ni(b)\u2217 \u03c9Z(b) \u2297 \u03c9X\n\nwith \u03c9... denoting the canonical sheaves on Z(b) and X.\nProof. We know from Corollary 14 that the 3-codimensional singularities in X\u2206(Q)\ncorrespond to the 2-dimensional, non-triangular faces of \u2206(Q) which are squares.\nOn the other hand, Proposition 27 establishes their relation to the simple knots b.\nFor any of it we may define\n\u0001\n\u0001#{R(b)\u2032 s}\nT (b) := \u2295R(b) T 1 \u2212 R(b) = D 1 F (Q \\ b)\nmeaning to sum over all R(\u2212b) in the sense of Corollary 28. Thus, the whole TX1\nsplits, as a C-vector space, into TX1 = \u2295b T (b).\n\nThe module structure of TX1 has been explained in Theorem 1: The dual cone of\n\u03c3 = cone(\u2206(Q)) \u2286 NR is \u03c3 \u2228 = cone(\u2207(Q)) \u2286 MR with M := Hom(N, Z) = IF \u2295 Z,\nc\ncf. (3.2). Whenever s \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M vanishes on F (Q \\ b), i.e. if s \u2208 cone \u2207(Q \\ b, \u03b8Q\n)\u2286\n\u0001\n\u0001\ns\n1\n1\ncone \u2207(Q), then the multiplication x : T \u2212 R(b) \u2192 T \u2212 R(b) + s is the iden\u0001\ntity map when both sides are identified with the one-dimensional D 1 F (Q \\ b) . If\ns does not vanish on F (Q \\ b), then the multiplication is zero.\nHence, the splitting of T 1 respects the module structure. Moreover, on the summands T (b), this structure factors through the surjection C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229M] \u2192\n\u2192 C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229F (Q\\\n\u22a5\nc\nb) \u2229 M] = C[cone \u2207(Q \\ b, \u03b8Q ) \u2229 M] with\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nT (b) = \u2295R\u2208 int cone \u2207(Q\\b, \u03b8Qc ) C * xR\u22121 \u2297C D 1 F (Q \\ b) .\nc\nOn the other hand, the semigroup algebra C[cone \u2207(Q \\ b, \u03b8Q\n) \u2229 M] equals the\ncoordinate ring of the stratum Z(b), and it is a general fact for affine toric varieties\nTV(\u03c4 ) = Spec C[\u03c4 \u2228 \u2229M] that \u2295R\u2208 int \u03c4 \u2228 C*xR equals the canonical module \u03c9TV(\u03c4 ) . \u0003\n\n(6.3)\nEventually, we would rather like to study the deformations of the projective toric variety P\u2207(Q) instead of that of its cone X\u2206(Q) . This just means to focus on\nthose multidegrees R with height or Z-degree 0, i.e. on R \u2208 IF \u00d7 {0} \u2286 IF \u00d7 Z = M.\nTo use Corollary 28 for describing the entire homogeneous piece TX1 (0), it is helpful\nto realize M as a subspace of ZQ1 . This is done by the isomorphism\nIF \u2295 Z\n\n\u223c\n\n/\n\n\u03c0 \u22121 (Z * \u03b8c ) ,\n\n(r, g) \u001f\n(\u2207 \u2212 1, 1)\n\u001f\n\n/\n\nr+g1\n/\n\n\u2207.\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n17\n\nUnder this map, the value of R = (r, g) \u2208 M on the vertex (a\u03b1 , 1) of (\u2207 \u2212 1, 1)\nequals the [\u03b1]-coordinate of R = r + g 1 \u2208 ZQ1 . In particular, multidegrees R of\nheight 0 are exactly those coming from \u03c0 \u22121 (0 * \u03b8c ) = IF \u2286 ZQ1 .\nDefinition 30. Let b be a simple knot and denote by a1 , a2 the tails of the two\narrows \u03b11 , \u03b12 with head b, respectively; c1 , c2 are defined in a similar manner on the\noutgoing arrows \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 .\na1 P\n\n1\n\n\u2736c\n\u270f\nPP\n\u270f\u270f\nb\n\u270f\nPP\nq \u2709\u270f\n\u2736\nPP\n\u270f\u270f\nPP\n\u270f\u270f\n\u270f\nP 2\nq\n2\n\na\n\nc\n\n1\n1\n2\n1 2\n1\nAn element R \u2208 ZQ\n\u22650 is called multipath from {a , a } to {c , c } if \u03c0(R) = [a ] +\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n[a ] \u2212 [c ] \u2212 [c ]. The standard example is Rb := [\u03b1 ] + [\u03b1 ] + [\u03b2 ] + [\u03b2 ] through b.\n\nTheorem 31. Running through the simple knots b \u2208 Q0 \\{p0 , . . . , pl }, the part TX1 (0)\nsplits into TX1 (0) = \u2295b T0 (b), and the dimension of each T0 (b) equals the number of\nmultipaths leading from {a1 , a2 } to {c1 , c2 }, but avoiding b.\nProof. Corollary 28 characterizes the T 1 -carrying multidegrees R(b) \u2208 ZQ1 assigned\nto the knot b by the properties\n\u2022 R(b)\u03b1 = 1 for \u03b1 being one of the four arrows touching b and\n\u2022 R(b)\u03b1 \u2264 0 for the remaining arrows \u03b1 \u2208 (Q \\ b)1 .\nOn the other hand, the condition of having height 0 means R(b) \u2208 IF , i.e. that\nR(b) encodes an cycle inside Q. Hence, the negative multidegrees \u2212R(b) represent\ncycles using each of the four b-arrows exactly once and in the wrong direction, but\nrespecting the orientation of the remaining arrows in Q. With other words, Rb \u2212R(b)\nrepresents a multipath from {a1 , a2 } to {c1 , c2 } avoiding b.\n\u0003\nExample 23 (continued). While, in the quiver Q1 of (5.5), the vertices a and b\ngive rise to unique multidegrees R(a) and R(b) of height 0, there are five multipaths\ncorresponding to c. Leaving out Rc , the remaining four paths do not touch c. Hence,\nthey are responsible for four dimensions inside the six-dimensional TX1 (0).\n(6.4)\nWhenever F < \u2206(Q) is a face, then there exist always degrees R \u2208 M =\n\u22121\nc\n\u03c0 (Z * \u03b8 ) such that R \u2264 1 on \u2206(Q) and R = 1 exactly on F \u2013 just take R as the\ndifference of 1 and an interior lattice point of the \u03c3 \u2228 -face dual to F . In particular, as\nwe have already seen in Theorem 29, every simple vertex b provides a contribution\nto TX1 .\nHowever, it might happen that simple vertices b do not provide multidegrees R(b) of\nheight 0. In the following non-plane flag quiver Q3 , every of the five inner vertices is\nsimple in the sense of Definition 26. While the knots c1 , . . . , c4 provide multidegrees\nR(ci ) of height 0, the knot b does not. The reason is that there is exactly one\nmultipath leading from {c3 , c4 } to {c1 , c2 }, but this multipath touches b.\n\n\f18\n\nKLAUS ALTMANN\n\nQ3\n\nDUCO VAN STRATEN\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n1\u2745\n\u2745 c2\n\u2745\nc \u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745 b\n\u2745\n\u2745\n3\n\u2745 c4 \u2745\nc \u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\np1\n\np0\n\nHere is another example. The plane flag quiver Q4 is built from Q1 of Example 23 in\n(5.5) by adding one single rope. However, this procedure removes the b-contribution\nfrom TX1 (0), i.e. T0 (b) = 0.\np1\nd\n4\nQ\nb\nc\na\np0\nIn general, the absence of TX1 (0)-pieces for a simple knot of Q means that the\ncorresponding A1 -singularity is, even locally, not smoothable with deformations of\ndegree 0. Hence, to obtain smoothability of P\u2207(Q) in codimension three, a neccessary\ncondition is that T0 (b) 6= 0 for every simple knot b of Q. Using Theorem 31, this\ntranslates into the existence of detouring multipaths around every simple knot.\n(6.5)\nWe will show that the just mentioned neccessary condition for smoothability in codimension three is sufficient, too. For simple knots b, the one-parameter\u0001\ndeformations of X\u2206(Q) provided by the one-dimensional vector spaces TX1 \u2212 R(b)\nare smoothings of the three-codimensional A1 -singularities along Z(b). The latter\nare the orbits of the three-dimensional cones over the faces F (Q \\ b) \u2264 \u2206(Q). The\nquestion whether these one-parameter families fit together in a huge deformation\ndoing all the smoothings simultaneously leads to the investigation of TX2 .\nTheorem 32. Whenever R \u2208 M is a positive linear combination of degrees Ri \u2208 M\ncarrying infinitesimal deformations, i.e. TX1 (\u2212Ri ) 6= 0, then TX2 (\u2212R) = 0.\nProof. Because of Corollary 14 and Theorem 1, we may assume that R \u2264 1 on\n\u2206(Q). To apply Theorem 2, we have first to check the three-dimensional faces of\n\u2206(Q) \u2229 [R = 1] \u2286 \u2206(Q) for non-pyramids, i.e. to exclude octahedra and prisms\ncorresponding to the triangular quivers depicted in (4.2). While the latter would\nprovide a three-dimensional face with non-trivial D 1 , which is excluded by Proposition 27, we need a finer argument for the octahedra:\nThe assumption of our theorem says that R\u03b1i = ha\u03b1 , Ri i \u2265 1 (in fact \" = 1\") holds\nexactly for the four arrows \u03b1 containing the simple knot b(Ri ), cf. Corollary 28 or\nthe proof of Theorem 31. In particular, since R is a positive linear combination\nof those Ri , the relation ha\u03b1 , Ri \u2265 1 is impossible, unless t(\u03b1) or h(\u03b1) is a simple\nvertex. On the other hand, if R = 1 was true on an octahedron F (P ), i.e. on the\n\n\fSMOOTHING OF QUIVER VARIETIES\n\n19\n\narrows of \u0393Q (P ) \u223c\n= \u0393dbl (3), then two of the three vertices of \u0393Q (P ) would equal original vertices from Q0 \\ {p0 , . . . , pl }. However, as for Q2 in Example 23 of (6.1), the\ndouble arrow between these vertices implies that they cannot be simple \u2013 providing\na contradiction.\nLet us now check the remaining assumptions of Theorem 2. The two-dimensional,\nnon-triangular faces of \u2206(Q) \u2229 [R = 1] are squares provided by simple knots b \u2208 Q0 ;\nthe four vertices of these squares correspond to the arrows containing b. In particular, the property of an arrow to contain exactly two knots translates into the\nproperty of an vertex a\u03b1 of \u2206(Q) to belong to at most\u0001two of these squares. This\nmeans that we are done in case of dim \u2206(Q)\u0001\u2229 [R = 1] \u2265 5.\nFor the remaining case dim \u2206(Q) \u2229 [R = 1] = 4, our argument requires a slight\nrefinement. To obtain vanishing of D 2 , we do not use Theorem 2 itself, but the\nstronger, original Theorem (4.7) of [AvS]: Since the quiver Q lacks oriented cycles, it provides a (non-linear) ordering of the set Q0 . Hence, whenever there is a\nconnected set of squares in our face [R = 1], then there is at least one vertex of\none of these squares that contains only this single square. Now, beginning with\nthis particular vertex, we may \"clean\" these squares in the sense of [AvS], (4.7)\nsuccessively.\n\u0003\nRemark. It is not true in general that TX2 = 0, cf. Example 5. However, the previous\ntheorem says that at least the obstructions inside TX2 are void.\nCorollary 33. Gorenstein singularities provided by flag quivers are smoothable in\ncodimension three. Moreover, if every simple knot b can be by-passed with a multipath\nconnecting its neighbors, then this can be done by a deformation of degree 0.\nProof. With the notation of Corollary 28, we choose one element R(b) \u2208 M for each\nsimple knot b. By the lack of obstructions, the corresponding one-parameter families\nfit into a common deformation over a smooth parameter space S.\nNow, looking at the general points of the singular three-codimensional strata, S\nis obtained from their one-dimensional versal deformations via base change. In\nparticular, for each of these strata, there is a hypersurface in S containing the\nparameters not smoothing this stratum. Hence, taking a curve inside S that avoids\nall these hypersurfaces outside 0 \u2208 S, yields the desired smoothing.\n\u0003\nExample 34. The 5-dimensional projective varieties P\u2207(Q) corresponing to the quivers Q1 iand Q2 of (5.5) are smoothable in codimension three. On the other hand, for\nthe quivers Q3 and Q4 of (6.4), we know this only for X\u2206(Q) = Cone(P\u2207(Q) ) instead\nfor P\u2207(Q) itself.\nReferences\n[AH]\n[AvS]\n\nAltmann, K., Hille, L.: Strong exceptional sequences provided by quivers.
