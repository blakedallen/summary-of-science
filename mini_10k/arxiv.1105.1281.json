MR data\ncontains important information about bulk electronic\nstructure of cuprate high temperature superconductors.\nThis was demonstrated by recent MR studies providing\ncompelling evidence for reconstruction of the Fermi surface in the pseudogap state of underdoped cuprates as a\nresult of density wave ordering [1, 2]. Several experimental techniques revealed the existence of two distinct energy scales in cuprates: the superconducting gap \u2206 and\nthe normal state pseudogap (PG) (for review, see e.g.\nRefs.[3\u20136]) with different behavior with respect to temperature [3, 7\u201313], doping [1, 14, 15] and magnetic field\n[16\u201318]. However, there is no consensus on whether they\nare competing [13, 19], cooperating [5], or representing\ntwo manifestations of the same phenomenon [5, 6, 20, 21].\nAnalysis of magnetic field effects is particularly useful for scrutinizing the superconducting origin of the\ngaps. Non-superconducting (e.g., structural, antiferromagnetic, charge, spin, or d-density wave) orders are\ntypically insensitive to achievable fields [19]. In this case,\nmagnetic field may selectively suppress the superconducting gap. However, discussion of magnetic field effects in\ncuprates remains controversial. Conflicting reports exist even on such a basic parameter as the upper critical\n\n\u2217\n\nVladimir.Krasnov@fysik.su.se\n\nfield Hc2 . It was reported that Hc2 behaves in a conventional manner, i.e., vanishes at Tc and scales with Tc as a\nfunction of doping [22\u201326]. But it was also reported that\nHc2 is T -independent and persists well above Tc [21] and\nincreases with underdoping despite reduction of Tc [27].\nThere are many obstacles for deciphering MR data of\ncuprates such as: fuzzy superconducting transition due\nto persistence of the PG; d-wave symmetry of \u2206; ill defined quasiparticles (QP) and strong angular dependence\nof QP scattering rates [28]; very high anisotropy, which\nrequires accurate control of transport current direction\nand sample geometry; existence of an extended fluctuation region above Tc [29]; possible doping inhomogeneity\n[6]; and extremely large Hc2 \u223c 100 T. One of the important open question is whether so large magnetic fields\nsimply suppress superconductivity, or simultaneously induce a competing order, as may be suggested by observation of charge density [6] and antiferromagnetic spin\norder [30] in vortex cores.\nTypically MR involves only QPs at the Fermi level,\naveraged over the Brillouin zone, and thus does not provide spectroscopic information about the QP density of\nstates (DOS) away from the Fermi surface. A rare exception is the c-axis transport in extremely anisotropic\nlayered cuprates. Single crystals of Bi, Tl [31, 32]\nand Hg [33] based cuprates represent natural stacks of\natomic scale intrinsic tunnel junctions. The intrinsic tunnelling spectroscopy (ITS) provides a unique opportunity to probe directly bulk electronic spectra of cuprates\n[7, 10, 13, 18, 34]. Tunneling MR is potentially a very\npowerful tool for analysis of superconducting features in\n\n\f2\nelectronic spectra. This was demonstrated in previous\nstudies for cuprates [16, 18, 35\u201337] as well as for conventional low-Tc [38\u201340] and non-cuprate [41] high Tc superconductors. Application of magnetic field leads to\nappearance of a spatially inhomogeneous mixed state.\nThis makes analysis of magnetotunneling data non-trivial\n[42, 43] and even counterintuitive [44]. Therefore, a clear\nunderstanding of how the magnetotunneling characteristics of Josephson junctions should behave is needed for\naccurate data analysis.\nIn this work we perform detailed comparison of magnetotunneling in low-Tc Nb/AlAlOx/Nb, and slightly overdoped Bi2\u2212y Pby Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 [Bi(Pb)-2212] intrinsic\nJosephson junctions with theoretical calculations. Small\nsizes of our Bi(Pb)-2212 mesas, which are one-two orders of magnitude smaller than in previous similar studies\n[16, 18, 36], in combination with the ability to extract information at the sub-gap bias with low dissipation power,\nlead to effective obviation of self-heating [13, 45, 46].\nBoth low- and high-Tc junctions show qualitatively similar behavior. Magnetic field and temperature suppress\nsuperconductivity in the state-conserving manner: enhancement of the sub-gap conductance due to suppression of \u2206(T, H) is exactly compensated by reduction of\nthe sum-gap conductance peak. As a result, the MR\nchanges sign from the negative at the sub-gap voltages\nto the positive at the sum-gap eV & 2\u2206. This allows\nus to trace closing of \u2206 at T \u2192 Tc with unprecedented\nclarity. We derive simple scaling laws for magnetotunneling and employ them for unambiguous extraction of superconducting parameters such as \u2206(T, H) and Hc2 (T ).\nThe extracted Hc2 (T ) decreases significantly upon approaching Tc . Our data indicates that superconductivity\nin slightly overdoped cuprates appears in a conventional\nmanner by means of the second order phase transition.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In sec. II we describe the theoretical formalism, used for microscopic calculation of current-voltage (I \u2212 V ) characteristics in the\nmixed state. Sec. III describes the experimental setup\nand studied junctions. Methods used for obviation of\nself-heating are discussed. In sec. IV we present main\nresults. It is shown that both Nb and Bi-2212 junctions\nbehave in a qualitatively similar way as a function of T\nand H. In sec. V we analyze scaling laws of different\ntunneling parameters as a function of H/Hc2 and apply\nthem for extraction of Hc2 in Nb-junctions. This also\nprovides a clear evidence for persistence of the surface\nsuperconductivity in Nb. In sec. VI we apply the same\nscaling laws for extraction of Hc2 (T ) for Bi(Pb)-2212 and\nanalyze the remaining MR above Tc . Finally, in sec. VII\nwe summarize our conclusions.\n\nnal unit cell of the Abrikosov vortex lattice by a circular\ncell with a radius corresponding to one flux quantum \u03a60\nwithin the cell, see the sketch in Fig. 1 (a),\nr\n\u03a60\n\u03c1=\n(1)\n\u03c0H\nand assume a cylindrically symmetric vector potential\nQ(r) = 1/r \u2212 r/\u03c12 .\n\nSpatial distribution of the order parameter \u2206(r) at different temperatures and magnetic fields are calculated by\nsolving microscopic Usadel equations:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0398\u2032n\n\u2032\u2032\n2\n\u03c0Tc \u03beS \u0398n +\n\u2212 \u03c9n sin(\u0398n ) \u2212\n(3)\nr\nQ2 (r) sin(\u0398n ) cos(\u0398n ) + \u2206 cos(\u0398n ) = 0,\ntogether with the self-consistency equation,\nX\n\u2206 ln(T /Tc ) + 2\u03c0T\n(\u2206/\u03c9n \u2212 sin(\u0398n )) = 0.\n\nTHEORY\n\nTo calculate spatially non-uniform distribution of the\ngap and the DOS in the mixed state, we use the circular\ncell approximation [47\u201349]. We approximate the hexago-\n\n(4)\n\nn\n\nHere \u03beS = (D/2\u03c0Tc )1/2 , where D is the QP diffusion\ncoefficient, \u03c9n = \u03c0T (2n + 1), n = 0, 1, 2, ... are Matsubara frequencies, cos(\u0398n ) and sin(\u0398n ) are the normal and\nthe anomalous Green function components, and primes\ndenote spatial derivation \u2202/\u2202r. Those equations are subject to boundary conditions at the center of the vortex\nr = 0: \u2206(0) = \u0398n (0) = 0, and at the edge of the circular cell r = \u03c1: \u2206(\u03c1)\u2032 = \u0398n (\u03c1)\u2032 = 0. This system of\nnonlinear equations was solved numerically, up to a cutoff frequency n \u2243 50 Tc /T , using an iterative procedure.\nMore details about the formalism and the numerical procedure can be found in Refs. [48\u201350].\nFig. 1 (b) shows an example of calculated spatial\ndistribution of \u2206(r) along the line connecting two vortices for the case of Nb (Tc = 8.8K) at T = 4.7K and\nH/Hc2 = 0.5. The \u2206(r) is normalized by the equilibrium\nvalue of the gap \u22060 (T ) at H = 0.\nTo calculate I \u2212 V characteristics in the mixed state,\nwe also need to calculate the spatial variation of the QP\nDOS N (r, E) as a function of the QP energy E. This is\ndone by analytic continuation of discrete \u0398n (\u03c9n ) to the\ncontinuous energy axis via substitution, \u03c9n = \u2212iE, in\nEq. (3), where i is the imaginary unit:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0398\u2032\n\u03c0Tc \u03beS2 \u0398\u2032\u2032 +\n+ iE sin(\u0398) \u2212\n(5)\nr\nQ2 (r) sin(\u0398) cos(\u0398) + \u2206(r) cos(\u0398) = 0.\nThe spatially non-uniform DOS is then obtained as\nN (r, E) = R (cos[\u0398(r, E)]) .\n\nII.\n\n(2)\n\n(6)\n\nLines in Fig. 1 (c) show N (r, E), normalized to the\nDOS in the normal state, at three points of the circular\ncell: A - at the center of the vortex, B - at the intermediate point where \u2206(r) recovers to half of its maximum value, see Fig. 1 (b), and C - at the edge of the\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1.

In the center of the vortex the superconductivity\nis completely suppressed, \u2206 = 0, and N (E) = 1, as in\nthe normal state. Away from the vortex the order parameter is partly restored, but QP spectra are gapless\nN (E < \u2206) 6= 0 [38\u201340]. Due to spatial inhomogeneity,\nthe maximum in DOS is significantly smeared, compared\nto the BCS singularity, and the energy of the maximum\nis no longer equal to \u2206(r).\nTunneling I \u2212 V characteristics are calculated by integration over the circular unit cell:\nZ +\u221e\nZ \u03c1\n1\n2r\nI(V ) =\ndE\n(7)\ndr\nRn 0 \u03c12\n\u2212\u221e\nN (r, E)N (r, E + eV )f (E) [1 \u2212 f (E + eV )] .\nHere Rn is the tunneling (normal) resistance and f is the\nFermi distribution function.\n\nA.\n\ndemonstrated [42, 51] that the scaling of DOS characteristics as a function of H/Hc2 , which will be discussed\nbelow, is valid also for d-wave superconductors (see e.g.\nFigs. 5 from Ref. [51]). Therefore, the procedure of extraction of Hc2 from such a scaling should be also valid\nfor intrinsic Josephson junctions.\nCoexistence of competing order parameters, associated\nwith the pseudogap, could also affect the tunneling DOS\nin cuprates [54, 55]. An influence of the PG on the intrinsic tunneling MR was reported for underdoped Bi-2212\n[16, 18, 27, 36, 43]. Namely, with underdoping the subgap MR is rapidly reduced [27] and suppression of superconductivity by magnetic field occurs in a seemingly\nnon-state-conserving manner [36]. This may indicate a\ngradual recovery of the competing PG order upon suppression of superconductivity, as observed in the vortex\ncores [6, 30]. To avoid possible complications, we restrict\nour analysis to slightly overdoped Bi(Pb)-2212, for which\nthere is no significant distortion by the PG [13, 56].\n\nValidity of the model\n\nThe described formalism is valid for arbitrary T and H\nfor dirty type-II superconductors with s-wave symmetry\nof the order parameter, which is appropriate for sputtered Nb films. Calculations presented below are made\nfor BCS parameters with Tc = 8.8 K, typical for Nb.\nThis allows direct comparison with experimental data for\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb junctions.\nIn Eq. (7) we disregard possible misalignment of vortices in the two electrodes. For intrinsic Josephson junctions, due to very high anisotropy and weak interlayer\ncoupling, such misalignment may be significant at low\nmagnetic fields [42], but could be neglected for high fields\nused in this work.\nCertain deviations can be expected for Bi-2212 due\nto the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter, which\nreduces the sum-gap singularity and affects the vortex structure [51\u201353]. However, theoretical calculations\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nWe study tunneling magnetorestistance in standard\nlow-Tc Nb/AlAlOx/Nb junctions and in small slightly\noverdoped Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa structures containing few\natomic scale intrinsic Josephson junctions. Measurements were performed in a gas-flow 4 He cryostat in a temperature range down to 1.6 K and magnetic field H up to\n17 T. Samples were mounted on a rotatable sample holder\nwith the alignment accuracy better than 0.02\u25e6 . Details\nof the measurement setup can be found in Refs. [34, 57].\n\nA.\n\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb junctions\n\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb junctions were made by the standard\nHYPRES trilayer technology [58] with a critical current\n\n\f4\ndensity of 1000 A/cm2 . A detailed description of junction\nparameters can be found in Ref. [59]. Junctions consist of\ntwo sputtered Nb thin films with thicknesses 150 and 50\nnm for base and counter electrodes, respectively. Due to\ndifferent thicknesses, electrodes have slightly different Tc .\nThe critical temperature of the junction is \u2243 8.8 K. The\njunction barrier is formed by deposition of a thin Al layer\nwith the thickness \u223c 10 nm on top of the base electrode,\nfollowed by a subsequent oxidation to form the AlOx tunnel barrier. During oxidation, only the surface layer of\nAl is oxidized, leaving the rest of Al intact. This results\nin a proximity effect between the bottom Nb layer and\nAl [50]. Tunneling occurs between the proximity-induced\nsuperconducting layer of Al and the top Nb layer. A detailed analysis of the proximity effect in Nb/AlAlOx/Nb\njunctions can be found in Ref. [50].\nSeveral junctions with different sizes on the same chip\nwere studied and showed similar results. As for the case\nof Bi-2212 mesas [13], with increasing junction area the\nsum-gap kink in I \u2212V becomes excessively sharp and may\neven develop a back-bending as a result of progressive\nself-heating [60]. Self-heating is effectively obviated by\nminiaturization of junctions [13, 45, 46]. Therefore, in\nwhat follows we show data only for the smallest junction\nwith sizes \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u03bcm2 , which is least affected by\nself-heating.\n\nB.\n\nBi-2212 intrinsic Josephson junctions\n\nWe study small, micrometer-size mesa structures containing few atomic scale intrinsic Josephson junctions.\nThe mesas are fabricated on top of Bi-2212 single crystals using micro/nano-fabrication techniques. Details of\nthe crystal growth and sample fabrication can be found\nin Refs. [61] and [62], respectively. Several contacts on\ntop of the crystals allow us to perform three or quasi-four\nprobe measurement of the pure c-axis transport [63]. Details of measurements and mesa characterization can be\nfound elsewhere [13, 14, 34].\nWe present data for two batches of crystals: leaddoped, slightly overdoped Bi2\u2212y Pby Sr2 CaCu2 08+x with\nTc \u2243 89 \u2212 93 K and yttrium-doped, slightly underdoped\nBi2 Sr2 Ca1\u2212x Yx Cu2 08+x (Bi(Y)-2212) with Tc \u2243 92 K.\nIt should be said that the c-axis phase coherence in\nsmall mesas is not a good measure of Tc . The associated Josephson coupling energy density is small, and\nthe total energy is decreasing proportional to the mesa\narea. Therefore, in small mesas the phase coherence\nand the c-axis critical current are suppressed by thermal fluctuations [62, 64] at temperatures significantly\nlower than that for the in-plane transport. A more detailed discussion on determination of Tc can be found in\nRef. [13]. Both types of crystals have similar optimal\nTc \u2243 96 K. The most noticeable difference between them\nis in the c-axis critical current density Jc (4.2 K) \u2243 104\nand 103 A/cm2 for lead- and yttrium-doped mesas, respectively. This is due to a rapid increase of Jc with\n\nover-doping [14].\nThe c-axis transport in Bi-2212 is non-metallic due to\ninterlayer tunneling mechanism of transport, in combination with the so-called c-axis pseudogap. The latter\nis much more pronounced than the PG in the ab-plane\ntransport [4, 9, 65] and exists in a broader temperature\n[7, 14] and doping ranges [6]. In Ref. [34] it was shown\nthat in the normal state T > Tc , c-axis intrinsic tunneling\ncharacteristics exhibit a trivial thermal-activation behavior, described by just one constant - the effective barrier\nheight. This puts a question whether the c-axis PG represents the real two-particle gap in the DOS or is just the\nsingle QP tunneling matrix phenomenon. In Ref. [13]\nmore subtle features in intrinsic tunneling characteristics\nwere found beyond the thermal-activation background.\nThose appear in the same temperature region as in the\nab-plane transport and were attributed to the genuine\ntwo-particle pseudogap in the QP DOS. A similar conclusion about the existence of two distinct pseudogap-like\nphenomena above Tc was also reached in optical infrared\nellipsometry studies [9, 65]. The PG complicates analysis\nof tunneling magnetoresistance because it makes the superconducting transition fuzzy. Since the main purpose\nof this work is to establish how to extract unambiguous\ninformation out of magnetotunneling data, here we will\nmostly concentrate on analysis of overdoped Bi(Pb)-2212\ncrystals, which according to previous studies are less affected by the PG and are most close to the conventional\nBCS-type superconductivity [56].\n\nC.\n\nObviation of self-heating in Bi-2212 mesas\n\nMesas with different sizes were made on the same single\ncrystal. As in the case of Nb/AlAlOx/Nb junctions [60],\nwe observe that I \u2212 V characteristics of larger mesas are\nmore distorted by self-heating at large bias [13]. To obviate self-heating, we perform additional miniaturization\nof mesa structures [13, 45, 46] down to sub-micrometer\nsizes using Focused Ion Beam trimming [62].\nThe dissipation powers at the sum-gap knee in I \u2212 V\n(the peak in dI/dV ) for the two small mesas shown in Fig.\n2 (c) and (d) are P \u2243 0.13 and 0.19 mW for Bi(Pb)-2212\nand Bi(Y)-2212 mesas, respectively, at the lowest temperatures. According to previous reports [13, 46], typical\nthermal resistances of our micrometer-size mesas lie in\nthe range \u223c 70\u221230 K/mW at low T and decrease to \u223c 10\nK/mW at Tc . Thus, self-heating at the sum-gap peak for\nthose small mesas is manageable and the effective mesa\ntemperature at the peak remains well below Tc . For the\nBi(Y)-2212 mesa this was unambiguously proven by analysis of the size-dependence of intrinsic tunneling spectra\nfor mesas with different sizes on the same single crystal\n[13, 46]. To completely exclude possible artifacts of selfheating from the data analysis, in what follows we define\nsuperconducting parameters from scaling laws valid for\ntunneling magnetoresistance at different bias levels, including low, sub-gap bias with negligible heating.\n\n\f5\n\n8.0,\n7.3,\n6.7,\n5.7,\n4.7,\n2.0\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n(b)\n\n0,1\n\n0\n4\n\n0,0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nV (mV)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nT(K)=\n23,\n50,\n60,\n70,\n80,\n90,\n120.\n\n0,4\n\n(c)\n\n0,0\n\n0\n\n40\n\nV (mV)\n\nT(K)=\n30,\n65,\n75,\n87,\n95,\n125,\n175.\n\n0,5\n\n(d)\n\n0,0\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\nV / N (mV)\n\nV / N (mV)\n100\n\nBCS\n\n1\n\nNb /AlAlOx/ Nb,\n2\u2206 Nb / kBTc = 3.9\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nT (K)\n\nBi(Y)-2212,\n2\u22060/kBTc= 8.2\n\n8\n\n0\n0\n\n(g)\n10\n\nBi(Pb)-2212,\n2\u2206 0 / kBTc= 6.1\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nT (K)\n\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb\n\nSub-gap\nresistance at eV =\u2206(T )\nSum-gap\n1\nconductance peak\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nT (K)\n\n(h)\n\n10\n\nRndI/dVp , dV/dI0 /Rn\n\n2\n\n60\n\n(f)\nRndI/dVp , dV/dI /Rn\n\n(e)\n\nVp (mV)\n\neVsg = \u2206Al + \u2206Nb (meV)\n\nT (K) =\n8.6,\n8.0,\n7.3,\n6.7,\n5.7,\n4.7,\n2.0\n\nI (mA)\n\n2\n\nBi(Y)-2212\n\nBi(Pb)-2212\n\n0,2\n\nI (mA)\n\n3\n\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb\n\nT (K) =\n8.6,\n\nTheory\nH = 0.\n\nI (mA)\n\nI Rn (mV)\n\n4\n\nBi(Pb) (Y)-2212\n\n1\n\n8\n\nR sub-gap,\ndI/dV peak\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 2.

Both\nmesas contain N = 9 intrinsic Josephson junctions, estimated by counting QP-branches in I \u2212 V [13]. It is\nseen that I \u2212 V s of Bi-2212 mesas are closely resembling those for conventional superconductor-insulatorsuperconductor tunnel junctions. The pronounced sumgap kink is clearly seen at low temperatures, followed by\nan almost T -independent tunneling resistance at higher\nbias. The sum-gap kink moves to lower voltage and vanishes in amplitude upon approaching the Tc [7, 13].\nExperimental characteristics of the Nb/AlAlOx/Nb\njunction can be explicitly compared with the corresponding theoretical simulations. It is seen that there is a good\nagreement, however, the proximity effect between Al and\nNb leads to some smearing out of the sum-gap kink and\nenhancement of the sub-gap conductivity. The most clear\nproximity induced peculiarity in I \u2212V of Nb/AlAlOx/Nb\nis the pronounced dip in dI/dV above the sum-gap peak\n\n(see Fig. 4 b). The dip is caused by the double maxima structure of the DOS in Al [50]: the lower maximum\ncorresponds to the proximity induced energy gap in Al,\n\u2206Al , the upper - to the inherited gap from Nb, \u2206N b .\nIn this case the sum-gap peak in conductance occurs at\neVsg = \u2206Al + \u2206N b and the dip at eV \u2243 2\u2206N b . Thus\ndetermined gaps are: \u2206Al = 1.22 meV and \u2206N b = 1.49\nmeV, consistent with previous reports [50].\nDue to the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter in\ncuprates, the sum-gap kinks in Bi-2212 intrinsic tunneling characteristics are significantly more smeared than in\ns-wave low-Tc junctions. From comparison of Figs. 2 (c)\nand (d) it is also clear that the sum-gap kink is further\nloosing its sharpness with underdoping [14].\nFigure 2 (e) and (f) represent T -dependencies of the\nsum-gap voltage (peak in dI/dV ) at H = 0 for the\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb junction and the Bi-2212 mesas (per intrinsic Josephson junction), respectively. They were obtained from I \u2212 V shown in Figs. 2 (b-d). The bulk gap\nof Bi(Y)-2212 follows very accurately the standard BCS\ndependence. More details on the T \u2212dependence of interlayer tunneling characteristics of our mesas can be found\nin Refs. [13, 34].\nBoth Nb and Bi-2212 demonstrate signatures of strong\ncoupling superconductivity. For Nb the ratio 2\u2206N b /Tc \u2243\n3.9, larger than the weak coupling BCS value of 3.5 for\ns-wave superconductors. For the slightly underdoped\nBi(Y)-2212, 2\u22060 /Tc \u2243 8.2.

(Color online). Magnetic field evolution of I \u2212 V characteristics at low T for (a) BCS calculations at T \u2243 2 K and\nTc = 8.8 K, (b) the Nb/AlAlOx/Nb junction at T \u2243 2 K. Semi-logarithmic plots of (c) theoretical I \u2212 V s at T \u2243 0.5 K, and\n(d) I \u2212 V s of a Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa in the sub-gap region at T \u2243 2 K for different c-axis field components. Note a remarkable\nalmost parallel translation of I \u2212 V s in the semi-logarithmic scale in (c) and (d).\n\nBi(Pb)-2212, the ratio decreases to 6.1. This is consistent with previous break junction studies, which indicated that in overdoped Bi-2212 2\u22060 /Tc is approaching\nthe weak coupling BCS value for d-wave superconductors\nof 4.28 [56].\nAs seen from Figs. 2 (b-d) in all cases the increase of\nT leads to simultaneous increase of the sub-gap current\nand decrease of the sharpness of the sum-gap kink. To\ndemonstrate this reciprocal correlation, in Figs. 2 (g) and\n(h) we plot the T \u2212dependence of the sub-gap resistance,\ndV /dI(V = \u2206/e), (solid symbols) and the sum-gap conductance peak, dI/dV (V = 2\u2206/e), (open symbols) for\nthe same junctions. For Nb/AlAlOx/Nb the correlation\nis observed in the whole temperature range. For Bi-2212\nthe correlation is holding well until \u223c Tc /2. The deviations at lower temperatures are caused by two artifacts\naffecting the sum-gap peak height. For Bi(Pb)-2212 the\npeaks becomes sharper because of self-heating and for\nBi(Y)-2212 it becomes broader because of minor inhomogeneity of junctions in the mesa [13, 66].\n\nB.\n\nAnalysis of tunneling magnetoresistance\n\nFigs. 3 (a) and (b) show calculated and measured I \u2212\nV s of Nb/AlAlOx/Nb at T \u2243 2 K for different out-ofplane magnetic fields. Again, a good agreement is seen.\nWith increasing field, the sub-gap current increases and\nthe sum-gap kink is rapidly smeared out. The I \u2212 V is\napproaching the ohmic normal-state at H \u2192 Hc2 .\nFrom comparison of theoretical curves in Figs. 2 (a)\nand 3 (a) it is seen that although both temperature and\nmagnetic field suppress superconductivity when T \u2192 Tc\nand H \u2192 Hc2 , there is a difference in how they do that.\nNamely, the temperature reduces \u2206 but does not affect\nthe shape of the QP DOS, which remains gapped N (E <\n\u2206) = 0 and maintains a sharp BCS singularity at the gap.\nBecause of that the sum-gap kink remains sharp even at\nelevated T . On the other hand, magnetic field first of all\nsmears the gap singularity in the DOS and the sum-gap\n\nkink in I \u2212 V and increases the sub-gap conductance by\nmaking the DOS gapless.\nFigure 3 (c) shows simulated I \u2212 V at different H and\nat T = 0.5 K in the semi-logarithmic scale. It is seen\nthat in this scale the curves remain almost parallel and\nmove to lower voltage with increasing H (negative MR).\nFig. 3 (d) represents the similar semi-logarithmic plot\nof I \u2212 V curves at different H and at T = 2K for a larger\nBi(Pb)-2212 mesa on the same crystal as in Fig. 2 (c).\nHere we changed the c-axis component of the field H\u22a5\nfrom 0 to 17 T by rotating the crystal with respect to\nthe fixed magnetic field of 17 T. Because of the extreme\nanisotropy of Bi-2212, in-plane magnetic field of 17 T\ndoes not produce any effect on QP DOS. This is clearly\nseen from the two rightmost I \u2212 V , which were measured\nat H = 0 (magenta) and at H = 17 T strictly parallel to\nthe ab-planes (black). The only minor difference between\nthose curves is caused by appearance of phonon-polariton\nresonances [67], seen as small steps in I \u2212 V .\nClearly, the general trend of experimental I \u2212 V for\nBi-2212 is the same as for numerical simulations and\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb: in the semi-logarithmic scale the curves\nremain parallel and move to lower voltages, as the consequence of suppression of the superconducting gap by\nfield. A similar trend was also observed for Bi-2212 intrinsic Josephson junctions as a function of T [13, 34].\nFor comparison, in Fig. 3 (d) we also show the I \u2212 V\nat T = 90 K\u2243 Tc at H = 0. Apparently, the maximum\navailable field of 17 T is insufficient for complete suppression of superconductivity at T = 2 K. The parallel shift of\nI \u2212V curves implies that the MR, V (I, H = 0)\u2212V (I, H),\nmeasured at fixed current and T , is approximately biasindependent. This is important because it allows a confident estimation of the MR in a broad sub-gap bias range,\nincluding low bias with low dissipation powers, which\nprecludes distortion by self-heating.\nFig. 4 shows tunneling conductance dI/dV (V ) curves\nin the semi-logarithmic scale at low T \u2243 2 K and at\ndifferent out-of-plane magnetic fields.

(Color online). Magnetic field evolution of dI/dV (V ) characteristics at low T : (a) BCS calculations at T = 2 K, (b)\nthe Nb/AlAlOx/Nb junction at T = 2 K and (c) a small Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa (normalized by dI/dV (T & Tc )) at T = 1.7 K. All\nplots are shown in the semi-logarithmic scale. Low bias structure in (c) is caused by excitation of phonon-polariton resonances\nby the ac-Josephson effect [67]. Due to state conservation, the magnetoresistance is negative in the sub-gap region, but positive\nat and above the sum-gap peak. Note also an almost parallel translation of ln dI/dV (V ) curves with H.\n\nNb junction from Figs. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. At\nzero field the main feature of dI/dV (V ) curves is the\nsharp sum-gap peak at Vp = 2\u2206/e, which reflects the\nsharp BCS singularity in the QP DOS at E = \u2206. With\nincreasing field, the peak is rapidly smeared out. Already\nat H = 0.1 Hc2 the height of the peak is suppressed\nby an order of magnitude. Simultaneously the sub-gap\nconductance at V < Vp is growing with field. The excess\nQP current is flowing in gapless vortex cores, see Fig. 1\n(a). It scales with the relative core area in the unit cell\nand, therefore, increases approximately linearly towards\nthe normal conductance at H \u2192 Hc2 .\nIn Fig. 4 (c) we show dI/dV (V ) characteristics in the\nsemi-logarithmic scale for different H\u22a5 at T = 1.7 K, for\nanother mesa 1\u00d71.9 \u03bcm2 on the same Bi(Pb)-2212 single\ncrystal. To simplify the analysis, the curves are normalized by the normal state curve at T = 100 K, so that the\nnormal state is simply represented by the dashed horizontal line. It is seen that dI/dV (V ) curves shift as a whole\nto lower voltages with increasing field. Simultaneously\nthe peak looses the height while the sub-gap conductance\nvice-versa increases with increasing field. Such the behavior is almost identical to that for the Nb/AlAlOx/Nb\njunction and calculations, shown in Figs. 4 (a) and (b).\n\nC.\n\nState conservation\n\nAccording to theory, suppression of superconductivity\nboth by temperature and magnetic field occurs in the\nstate-conserving manner. Even though superconductorinsulator-superconductor tunneling is not probing explicitly the single QP DOS, but rather the convolution of two\nDOS from the two electrodes, Eq. (7), it is still possible\nto judge about the state conservation by a simple inte-\n\ngration of dI/dV curves:\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\u0012\ndI\nRn\n\u2212 1 dV = 0.\ndV\n0\n\n(8)\n\nThe state conservation is the reason for T - and Hindependence of the large bias tunneling resistance Rn ,\nas seen from Figs. 2 (a) and 3 (a).\nFrom Figs. 2 (b-d) it is clear that both in low-Tc\nand high-Tc junctions the Ohmic tunneling resistance\nRn above the sum-gap kink is remaining almost T independent. According to Eq. (8), this automatically\nimplies that closing of the superconducting gap by temperature occurs in the state-conserving matter.\nState conservation implies that the tunneling resistance is enhanced in the sub-gap region in the same manner as the conductance is enhanced at the sum-gap peak.\nThis is demonstrated explicitly, in Figs. 2 (g) and (f) for\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb and Bi-2212 junctions, respectively. It\nis seen that the sub-gap resistance dV /dI in the middle\nof the sub-gap region eV = \u2206(T ) and the sum-gap conductance peak grow in a similar manner with decreasing\nT . Such a scaling is an instructive way for examining the\nstate conservation in Bi-2212 because it does not depend\non a small Rn (T ) dependence [7, 34], which is likely due\nto a minor in-plane (coherent) contribution to the interlayer transport [68].\nD.\n\nThe sign change of tunneling magnetoresistance\n\nThe tunneling MR in superconducting tunnel junctions\nand the c-axis MR in layered cuprates is often described\nas negative. That is, the resistance decreases with increasing field. This is the consequence of appearance of\nthe gapless state in magnetic field. The corresponding\nincrease of the sub-gap DOS leads to approximately linear increase of the low bias tunneling conductance with\n\n\f8\nfield [43]. This is clearly seen in Fig. 4. However it is also\nseen that at the sum-gap peak the situation is reversed:\nthe tunneling conductance is decreasing with increasing\nfield, i.e., the tunneling MR at V & Vp is positive. Thus,\nthe tunneling MR is changing sign from the negative at\nthe sub-gap voltage to the positive close and above the\nsum-gap voltage. Again, the behavior is similar for both\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb and Bi(Pb)-2212 junctions.\nThe sign change of the tunneling MR is a direct consequence of state conservation. The missing area of the\nsub-gap conductance with respect to normal conductance\n1/Rn is equal to the excess area of the sum-gap peak.\nTherefore, the positive MR at large bias is directly connected with the negative MR at low bias. The discussed\nsign-change of the MR is very characteristic and can be\nused for unambiguous discrimination of the superconducting gap from non-pairing effects in the tunneling\nDOS, such as peculiarities of one-QP band structure, or\nthermal activation enhancement of the tunneling matrix\nelements for interlayer hopping [34].\n\nV.\n\nSCALING LAWS OF TUNNELING\nMAGNETORESISTANCE\n\nThe main purpose of this work is to determine how\nto extract useful information from tunneling MR. To understand this we first consider the behavior of magnetotunneling for conventional BCS superconductors. For\nthis we analyze numerically calculated and experimental\ncharacteristics for Nb junctions at different T and H.\n\nA.\n\nZero-bias magnetoresistance\n\nTransport measurements are usually performed by applying a small ac-current, i.e., probe zero-bias MR. Thick\nlines in Fig. 5 (a) show theoretical values of the zero bias\nconductance dI/dV (0), normalized by Rn , as a function\nof H/Hc2 for T = 2, 4.7 and 7.3 K. It is seen that at low\nT = 2 K, the zero bias conductance is gradually increasing from almost zero at H = 0, to normal conductance\nat Hc2 (T ) (see Fig. 4 (a)).\nTemperature dependence of dI/dV (0) at H = 0 can\nbe seen from I \u2212 V curves in Fig. 2 (b). The increase of\nT leads to the decrease of \u2206. Both factors result in the\nincreased number of excited QPs above the gap, which\ninitially leads to a rapid filling-in of the zero-bias dip in\nconductance and then to development of a maximum at\nV = 0. The latter represents a zero-bias logarithmic singularity [69]. It occurs because at elevated T there is a\nsubstantial amount of thermally excited QPs just above\nthe gap. At V = 0 the partly filled gap singularities in\nthe two electrodes are co-aligned, causing a large current\nflow from one electrode to another, which is exactly compensated by the counterflow from the second electrode.\nHowever, exact cancellation is lifted at an arbitrary small\nvoltage across the junction, leading to a sharp maximum\n\nin dI/dV . The zero-bias logarithmic singularity leads to\nan overshooting of dI/dV (0) at H = 0 over the normal\nconductance at T = 7.3 K in Fig. 5 (a).\nThe zero-bias logarithmic singularity makes the behavior of the zero-bias conductance non-trivial. In general,\nthere is no scaling with H/Hc2 for dI/dV (0) at different\nT , as seen from Fig. 5 (a). To avoid complications caused\nby the zero-bias singularity we look at the behavior of the\nconductance at finite bias.\n\nB.\n\nScaling of the sub-gap conductance and the\nsum-gap resistance\n\nFig. 5 (b) shows field dependence of the sub-gap conductance at the middle point eV = \u2206 for the same temperatures as in (a). It is seen that unlike dI/dV (0), the\nsub-gap conductance is showing a fairly universal linear\nscaling as a function of H/Hc2 for different T .\nAs follows from Figs. 2 (g) and (h), state conservation\nimplies that the deficit of the sub-gap conductance is\ndirectly connected to the excess of the sum-gap peak, i.e.,\nthe deficit of the sum-gap resistance. Fig. 5 (c) shows\nmagnetic field dependence of the sum-gap resistance. It\nis showing an almost universal, slightly non-linear scaling\nas a function of H/Hc2 in the wide T -range.\nFig. 5 (d) shows magnetic field dependence of the sumgap peak voltage Vp normalized by that at zero field. It\nexhibits a very simple universal linear scaling as a function of H/Hc2 in the whole T \u2212range. Interestingly, the\npeak voltage does not go to zero at H = Hc2 , but rather\nstops half-way at eV \u2243 \u2206(H = 0). This is due to an\ninterplay between the reduction of \u2206(H), see Fig. 1 (b),\nwhich moves the peak down, and simultaneous strong\nsmearing of the maximum in the QP DOS, see Fig. 1 (c),\nwhich moves the peak up in voltage. At H = Hc2 , \u2206\ndoes vanish, but voltages/energies of very broad maxima\nin dI/dV or spatially averaged DOS do not vanish [44],\nas can be seen from Fig. 4 (b).\n\nC.\n\nExtraction of Hc2 for Nb\n\nThe universal scaling of the sum-gap peak voltage\nVp (H/Hc2 ) can be used for extraction of Hc2 from magnetotunneling data. Symbols in Fig. 5 (d) show the results\nof fitting for the Nb/AlAlOx/Nb junction, using Hc2 (T )\nas the only adjustable parameter. It is seen that the\nagreement with theoretical calculations is excellent. T dependence of the obtained upper critical field is shown\nin Fig. 5 (e). Due to the proximity effect in Al it is\nmore linear at low T than that for pure Nb. A similar\n\u22a5\nHc2\n(T ) was also reported for proximity coupled Nb/Cu\nmultilayers [70].\nUsing thus extracted Hc2 , we check the scaling of other\nexperimental parameters such as the zero bias and the\nsub-gap conductances and the sum-gap resistance, shown\nby symbols in Figs. 5 (a), (b) and (c).

Note that there is no scaling of dI/dV (0) for\ndifferent T due to progressive development of the zero-bias logarithmic singularity with increasing T . Thin solid lines and the\ninset show evolution of the conductance of Nb-electrodes at H > Hc2 . It is seen that the surface superconductivity in electrodes\nsurvives up to Hc3 \u2243 1.69Hc2 .

(e) The upper critical field for Nb, extracted from the scaling.\n\nagreement with theory is very good, confirming the correctness of determination of Hc2 .\n\nD.\n\nSurface superconductivity above Hc2 in Nb\n\nThe only case where there is a certain disagreement between theory and experiment is dI/dV (0) at high fields\nin Fig. 5 (a): experimental data at T = 2 K and 4.7 K is\nclearly not reaching the normal conductance at H = Hc2 .\nAt higher fields it is not possible to measure junction\ncharacteristics because the Nb electrodes are no longer\ncapable to carry the supercurrent and turn into the resistive state. Since the electrode resistance is several times\nlarger than that of the junction, the measured resistance\nin this case is mostly given by the longitudinal resistances\nof the Nb electrodes. This leads to the drastic decrease\nin the measured zero-bias conductance, as shown by thin\nsolid lines in Fig. 5 (a). From this data it is obvious that\nsome residual superconductivity in the Nb electrodes is\nremaining up to fields significantly larger than Hc2 .\nThe inset in Fig. 5 (a) shows the detailed view of\nthe onset of the superconducting transition in Nb electrodes. It is seen that at low T = 2 K superconductivity\n\nin Nb survives up to almost exactly 1.69Hc2, which is\nthe expected value of the third critical field Hc3 . At\nHc2 < H < Hc3 superconductivity exists only in surface\nlayers. A similar behavior has been reported in clean Nb\n[71\u201373] as well as in MgB2 [74]. From the inset in Fig.\n5 (a) it is seen that the ratio Hc3 /Hc2 is decreasing with\nincreasing temperature. A similar behavior was reported\nfor clean Nb and discussed in terms of a tricritical point\n[71]. However, it should be noted that our Nb films are\nin the dirty limit and are affected by the proximity effect\nwith Al. The columnar structure of sputtered Nb films\nwith a large effective surface-to-volume ratio and columns\norientation perpendicular to the film may also enhance\nthe role of surface superconductivity in the out-of-plane\nmagnetic field.\n\nVI. ANALYSIS OF INTRINSIC\nMAGNETOTUNNELING IN BI-2212\n\nObservation of a fairly conventional behavior of tunneling MR in overdoped Bi(Pb)-2212 encourage us to\nemploy the derived scaling laws for extraction of the T dependent upper critical field, which remains a contro-\n\n\f10\n1,01\n\n2\n1,5\n\nH (T) = 0\n\nHc2\nT =1.7 K\n\n0,5\n\n(a)\n0\n\n10\n\nBi(Pb)-2212\nSum-gap resistance\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\ndI/dV / dI/dV(T=Tc)\n\n70 K\n\nT\n\n75 K\n\n1\n\n1\n3\n5\n10\n16\n\n(b)\n\nT =75 K\n0,0\n\n0,1\n\nH (T)\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\nV (V)\n\ndI/dV(Hllab) / dI/dV(Hllc)\n\ndV/dIpeak/ dV/dI (T=Tc )\n\n1,0\n\n75 K\n\n1,00\n0,99\n0,0\n\nT = 95K\n0,1\n\n(c)\n1,0\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n85 K\n95 K\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\nV (V)\n\nFIG. 6.

Inset shows enhanced view of the curve at T = 95 K.\n\nversial issue for cuprates, as mentioned in the introduction. The obtained scaling of the sum-gap peak voltage\nVp (H/Hc2 ) is valid not only for tunnel junctions made\nof s-wave superconductors. A similar scaling was also\nreported for \u2206(H/Hc2 ) in the mixed state of d-wave superconductors [51]. In the remaining part of this work we\napply the scaling rules for Bi(Pb)-2212 mesas in order to\nunderstand how normal or abnormal the behavior of intrinsic tunneling magnetoresistance is and in an attempt\nto estimate the upper critical field.\n\nA.\n\nScaling of the sum-gap peak\n\nAs seen from Fig. 4 (c), at low T dI/dV (V ) characteristics of the Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa, normalized by the\nnormal state dI/dV , behaves in a conventional manner:\nthe sum-gap peak is smeared and moves to lower voltage\nwith increasing the c\u2212axis component of the field. Solid\nsquares in Fig. 6 (a) represent the corresponding peak\nresistance as a function of field. Apparently, it follows the\nsame tendency of quasi-linear grows as for Nb-junction,\nshown in Fig. 5 (c). This allows an approximate estimation of Hc2 by linear extrapolation of the curves to unity,\nas shown by dotted lines.\nFigure 6 (b) shows magnetic field dependence of\ndI/dV (V ) for the mesa from Fig. 3 (d) at T = 75 K. Here\nwe also normalized the dI/dV (V ) curves by that above\nTc . It is seen that the general behavior of the tunneling\nMR is the same as at low T : the sub-gap conductance\nincreases (negative MR) at the expense of the sum-gap\nconductance peak (positive MR) in the state-conserving\nmanner. The corresponding peak resistances are shown\nby open circles in Fig. 6 (a). However, the sum-gap peak\nis no longer moving to lower voltages with increasing H,\nbut instead spreads out to higher voltages. As discussed\n\nin Ref. [44], such a behavior is not totaly unusual. As a\nmatter of fact the upturn of the peak voltage for high H\nand T is also observed in theory and for Nb/AlAlOx/Nb\njunctions, even though in a smaller scale, see curves at\nT = 4.7 K in Fig. 5 (d). As discussed above, the outward motion of the peak is the consequence of smearing\nof the peak in DOS, rather than the actual increase of\n\u2206. This is also the reason why Vp does not go to zero at\nH \u2192 Hc2 , despite \u2206 does vanish.\nFigure 6 (c) shows the ratio of conductances at H =\n10 T oriented parallel to ab-planes (which, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (d) is equivalent to zero-field) and in the\nc-axis direction. Such a normalization perfectly removes\nall field independent features and allows observation with\nunprecedented clarity superconducting parts of the spectra at T \u2192 Tc . In Fig. 6 (c) we clearly see the sum-gap\npeak at T = 85 K, which is practically indistinguishable\nin dI/dV (V ) characteristics. Remarkably, we can observe the peak even at T = 95 K (see the inset), which is\nabove the critical temperature for appearance of phasecoherence in the c-axis direction Tcphase = 91 \u2212 92 K.\nApparently the superconducting gap is still present at 95\nK, but its value is rapidly decreasing at this temperature,\nas it does in BCS theory close to the mean-field Tc0 , see\nFig. 2 (f). This is consistent with the conclusion of Ref.\n[13] that superconductivity in near optimally doped Bi2212 appears by means of the second-order phase transition in the conventional BCS-manner. However, the true\nthermodynamic mean-field critical temperature Tc0 \u2243 96\nK is some-what higher than Tcphase .\n\nB.\n\nScaling of the sub-gap voltage\n\nAs seen from Fig. 3 (c), the voltage at a given current\nis decreasing with increasing field and reaches the normal\n\n\f11\n\n2\n\n0,4\n\n0.3\n\n0,2\n1\n\n1.5\n3.0\n\n(a) T = 0.5 K\n\n0.4\n0.5\n0.2\n0.15\n1.0\n0.1\n\nT (K) =\n\n70 25\n50\n\n90\n\n2\n1\n\n3\n\n0\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\nVn (V)\n\n1.5\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\nH / Hc2\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n0,0\n\n0\n\n(b) T = 3 K\n\n20\n\n40\n\nH (T)\n\nsub-gap MR\nI (mA) =\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0,02\n\n0.05\n0\n0,0\n\nBi(Pb)-2212\n\n0,04\n\nV - Vn (V)\n\nV(I) - IRn (mV)\n\nTheory\n\nI (mA) =\n\nV - Vn (V)\n\nI Rn (mV) =\n1.0\n0.5\n0.25\n0.1\n\nI (mA)\n\n3\n\n0,00\n0\n\n60\n\nHc2\n\n3.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n0.05\n\n10\n\n20\n\n(c) T = 70 K\n\n30\n\nH (T)\n\n40\n\nHc2\n\nFIG. 7. (Color online). Magnetic field dependence of the voltage at a given current for (a) theoretical calculation, current\nlevels correspond to horizontal lines in Fig. 3 (c), and for Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa at (b) T = 3 K and (c) T = 70 K at different bias\ncurrents. Inset in (b) shows normal-state I \u2212 V s obtained by adjustment of V \u2212 Vn so that they vanish at the same H = Hc2 ,\nas indicated by dotted lines in (b) and (c).\n\nstate value Vn (I) = IRn at H = Hc2 . Fig. 7 (a) shows the\ncorresponding values of V (I, H) for four bias currents,\nindicated by horizontal lines in Fig. 3 (c), as a function\nof H/Hc2 . It is seen that in a wide bias range (an order\nof magnitude) V (I, H) \u2212 IRn have the same magnitude\nand disappears in a linear manner at H \u2192 Hc2 . This\nfairly good and almost bias-independent scaling is the\nconsequence of the almost parallel shift of I \u2212 V s (in the\nsemi-logarithmic scale) with increasing H, as shown in\nFigs. 3 (c), . The dI/dV (V ) curves behave in the same\nmanner, as shown in Fig. 4.\nFig. 3 (d) demonstrates that for Bi(Pb)-2212 such parallel translation of I \u2212 V curves is even more impressive\nand expands to almost two orders of magnitude in bias\ncurrent. However, there is one major obstacle for determination of the Hc2 from such the scaling. Namely, the\nshape of the I \u2212 V in the normal state, i.e., with completely suppressed superconductivity but at low T < Tc ,\nis unknown. We can only say for sure that it remains\nnon-linear above Tc as a result of thermal-activation caxis transport (not necessarily connected with the pseudogap) [34]. To go around this problem, we note that\naccording to Fig. 7 (a), voltages at all bias levels must\nreach the normal state values Vn (I) in a quasi-linear manner at the same H = Hc2 . Therefore, we used Vn (I) as\nan adjustable parameter for each bias current, so that\nall V (I) \u2212 Vn (I) voltages go to zero at the same point\nH = Hc2 (T ), as indicated by dotted lines in Figs. 7 (b)\nand (c). Thus obtained normal state I \u2212 V curves at\nT < Tc are shown in the inset of Fig. 7 (b).\nFigure 7 (b) and (c) show H\u22a5 -dependence of the subgap voltages at different bias currents, for (b) T = 3\nK and (c) 70 K. We observe a quasi-linear reduction of\nvoltages, consistent with theoretical curves in Fig. 7 (a).\nThe extrapolated value of Hc2 at T = 3 K is 75.5 \u00b1\n14.5T. A significant uncertainty is due to the need for\n\nremote extrapolation from the maximum available field\nof 17 T. However, at low T it is not crucially affected by\nthe adjustment of Vn . Indeed, already from the raw data\nin Fig. 3 (d) it is seen that in fields from 0 to 17 T the\nI \u2212V curves made approximately 1/4\u22121/5 of the journey\nto the normal state I \u2212 V at T = 90K. Assuming a linear\ndependence of V (H), this provides a similar estimation\nof Hc2 \u223c 68 \u2212 85 T.\n\nC.\n\nTemperature dependence of the maximum\nc\u2212axis magnetoresistance\n\nFig. 8 (a) shows temperature dependence of the maximum measured shift of voltage at a constant current\nupon variation of the c-axis magnetic field from 0 to 17\nT. It is seen that the negative sub-gap tunneling MR\nis rapidly decreasing with increasing temperature, cf.\nscales in Figs. 7 (b) and (c). This makes determination of Hc2 at elevated T less confident because it becomes more sensitive to exact values of Vn . For comparison, Fig. 8 (b) shows similar data for the Nb-junction\nat H = 0.44 T, which corresponds to the same ratio\nH/Hc2 (T = 0) \u2243 0.24 as for Bi(Pb)-2212 from panel\n(a). The tunneling MR in the Nb-junction vanishes at\nT \u2243 7 K< Tc , at which Hc2 (T ) = H, see Fig. 5 (e).\nFrom comparison of Figs. 8 (a) and (b) it is seen that\nbehavior of the maximum MR is qualitatively similar for\nNb and Bi(Pb)-2212. However, for Bi(Pb)-2212 it becomes more smeared and fuzzy at T \u2192 Tc . To some\nextent the smoother T \u2212dependence for Bi-2212 may be\ncaused by the d-wave symmetry, because nodal QP's are\nmore prone to thermal activation above the gap at elevated T . Still this does not explain everything.\nThe inset in Fig. 8 (a) shows the same data for Bi(Pb)2212 in the semi-logarithmic scale.

We assume that the remaining small negative MR\nabove Tc is a consequence of fluctuation superconductivity, which becomes progressively less sensitive to mag\u2217\nnetic field due to growth of the effective Hc2\n\u221d T \u2212 Tc\nabove Tc [29].\n\ngray area in Fig. 8. We see the clear presence of the superconducting gap in the DOS above the phase coherent\nTcphase \u2243 91 K up to the mean-field Tc0 \u2243 96 K [13]. The\nmain experimental challenge is associated with a very\nsmall sub-gap MR close to Tc , see Fig. 8 (a). However,\nat T = 95 K any sign of the sum-gap peak is absent at\nH = 15 T, which provides a rough estimation for the last\npoint in the Hc2 (T ) diagram of Fig. 8 (c).\n\nVII.\nD.\n\nExtraction of Hc2 for Bi-2212\n\nAs follows from Fig. 5 (c), scaling of sum-gap magnetoresistance provides the most accurate way of determination of Hc2 . The corresponding data for Bi(Pb)-2212\nare shown in Fig. 6 (a). Data for 1.7 K and 75 K correspond to Figs. 4 (d) and 6 (b). The upper critical field is\nestimated using a linear extrapolation towards the normal resistance, as indicated by dotted lines. There is a\nsignificant uncertainty in such extrapolation, however it\nis more robust than that made from sub-gap MR, see\nFig. 7, because the normal resistance at a large bias is\nmore unambiguous and has a weak T -dependence [7, 34],\nas seen from Fig. 2 (c).\nFigure 8 (c) shows the extracted T -dependence of the\nupper critical field for the slightly overdoped Bi(Pb)-2212\nsingle crystal. Solid squares and open symbols are obtained from analysis of scaling of the sub-gap voltage,\nFigs. 7 (b) and (c), and the sum-gap resistance, Fig. 6\n(a), respectively. Hc2 (T = 0) is \u223c 70 T and certainly\ndecreases with increasing T . As mentioned in the introduction, one of the principle questions is whether Hc2\ngoes to zero at Tc . This appears to be a difficult question. First, the notion of Tc is fuzzy, as indicated by the\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe performed a detailed comparative analysis of\ntunneling magnetoresistances in conventional low-Tc\nNb/AlAlOx/Nb junctions, small Bi(Pb)-2212 intrinsic\nJosephson junctions and microscopic calculations. It\nwas found that magnetotunneling in slightly overdoped\nBi(Pb)-2212 is qualitatively similar to that in conventional BCS-type superconductors.\nFrom the data presented above it is clearly seen that\nboth temperature and magnetic field suppress superconductivity in Bi(Pb)-2212 in the state conserving manner.\nMagnetotunneling provides a particularly clear demonstration of this: due to conservation of states the MR\nchanges sign from the negative in the sub-gap, to the\npositive at the sum-gap bias. Continuing strong MR\nwell above the sum-gap peak with powers up to several\ntimes that on the peak indicate that the mesa remains\nin the superconducting state and the peak is not caused\nby self-heating. This clearly demonstrates that intrinsic\ntunneling can provide unambiguous information about\nbulk electronic spectra of Bi-2212.\nObservation of state conservation implies that QP\nstates released upon suppression of superconductivity by\nmagnetic field are not taken over by a competing order,\nlike charge or spin density wave. In other words, there\n\n\f13\nis no field-induced non-superconducting order in slightly\noverdoped Bi(Pb)-2212. The situation may, however be\ndifferent for underdoped Bi-2212, for which non-stateconserving characteristics have been reported [36, 75].\nWe derived theoretically and verified experimentally\nscaling laws of various magnetotunneling parameters.\nThose scaling laws were employed for accurate extraction\nof the upper critical fields and in the case of Nb provided\na clear evidence for the existence of an extended region\nof surface superconductivity at Hc2 < H < Hc3 .\n\nponentially at T > Tc /2. It remains negative, although\nvery small, above Tc , probably indicating existence of an\nextended fluctuation region.\nWe conclude in general that intrinsic magnetotunneling in small mesa structures is a very powerful tool for\nanalysis of bulk superconducting properties of cuprates.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nFor Bi(Pb)-2212, it was found that Hc2 (T = 0) \u2243\n70 T and decreases significantly upon approaching Tc .\nThe parameters of Bi(Pb)-2212 were obtained from selfconsistent analysis of magnetotunneling data at different\nlevels of bias, dissipation powers and different mesa sizes,\nwhich precludes the influence of self-heating. The amplitude of the sub-gap magnetoresistance is suppressed ex-\n\nWe are grateful to A. Golubov for assistance\nwith numerical simulations, D.
