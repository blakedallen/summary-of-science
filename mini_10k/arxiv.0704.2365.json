The current and future neutron \u03b2 decay correlation experiments\nincluding the UCNA experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory are reviewed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHigh precision electroweak measurements provide\nstringent tests of the standard model (SM) and search\nfor what may lie beyond it. A deviation from expectations based on our knowledge of the SM would be indirect\nevidence for new physics. These high precision tests complement direct searches for new physics using high energy\ncollides.\nUnitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix\n(CKM matrix) requires that the first row satisfy\n|Vud |2 + |Vus |2 + |Vub |2 = 1.\n\nfrom nuclear \u03b2 decays, in particular of the nuclear dependent corrections. Furthermore, precision measurements\nof neutron decay parameters hold the most promise for\na further improvement of the determination of |Vud |.\nDetermination of |Vud | from neutron \u03b2 decay requires\nknowledge of the neutron lifetime \u03c4n and the ratio of the\naxial to vector coupling constants \u03bb = GA /GV . In the\nfollowing, after a brief review of the current status of\nthe |Vud | determination, we will review the current and\nfuture neutron \u03b2 decay correlation measurements, which\nprovide determination of \u03bb. The status of the neutron\nlifetime experiments is reviewed in Ref. [3].\n\n(1)\n\nA deviation from unity could arise from additional heavy\nquark mixing. Also, because the extraction of these CKM\nmatrix elements involves comparison between muon decay and semileptonic decay of hadrons, any new physics\nthat causes a violation of quark-lepton universality would\ncause a deviation from unity.\nThe value of |Vud | has been obtained from superallowed nuclear \u03b2 decays, neutron \u03b2 decay, and pion \u03b2\ndecay. The current determination of the value of |Vud |\nis dominated by superallowed nuclear \u03b2 decays [1]. The\nvalue is (using an updated electroweak radiative correction [2]) |Vud | = 0.97377(11)(15)(19). The uncertainties\nare (1) nuclear structure uncertainty added in quadrature with the experimental uncertainty in the f t value,\n(2) uncertainty in coulomb distortion effects, and (3) uncertainty from quantum loop effects. Although the third\nuncertainty is common to both |Vud | determination from\nnuclear \u03b2 decay and that from neutron \u03b2 decay, |Vud |\ndetermination from neutron \u03b2 decay is free from nuclear\ncorrections that are associated with uncertainties (1) and\n(2). Therefore, neutron \u03b2 decay can in principle provide\na determination of |Vud | with a smaller theoretical uncertainty than nuclear \u03b2 decay.\nWith more intense sources of cold and ultracold neutrons becoming available and with improved experimental techniques being developed, determination of |Vud |\nfrom neutron \u03b2 decay with a similar precision to that\nfrom nuclear \u03b2 decay is within reach. This will provide\na useful cross check of the current determination of |Vud |\n\nSTATUS OF Vud DETERMINATION FROM\nNEUTRON \u03b2 DECAY\n\nThe value of |Vud | is determined by comparing the vector coupling constant of \u03b2 decay, GV , to the Fermi coupling constant, GF , determined from muon decay. In the\ncase of free neutron \u03b2 decay, knowledge of both neutron\nlifetime \u03c4n and the ratio of the axial to vector coupling\nconstant \u03bb = GA /GV is required to determine GV .\n|Vud |2 =\n=\n\nG2V\n+ \u2206R )\n\nG2F (1\n\nG2F m5e \u03c4n (1\n\n2\u03c0 2\n,\n+ 3\u03bb2 )f R (1 + \u2206R )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206R is the quantum loop correction mentioned earlier, me is the electron mass, f R is the phase space factor (including the outer radiative correction). Numerically [2],\n|Vud |2 =\n\n4908.7(1.9) s\n,\n\u03c4n (1 + 3\u03bb)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the uncertainty quoted is from \u2206R .\nThe value of \u03bb is determined from measurements of\ndecay correlations. The differential decay rate, averaged\nover electron spin, is given by [4]\ndW\n2\n\u221d pe Ee (E0 \u2212 Ee )\ndEe d\u03a9e d\u03a9\u03bd\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\npe\np\u03bd\npe * p\u03bd\n, (4)\n+ h\u03c3n i * A\n+B\n\u00d7 1+a\nEe E\u03bd\nEe\nE\u03bd\n\n\f2\nof the two electron detectors located at the ends of the\ndecay volume. When the detectors have a 4\u03c0 coverage\nof \u03b2 decay events, the asymmetry in the count rate in\nthe two detectors can be related to the A coefficient as\nfollows:\nAexp (Ee ) =\n\nFIG. 1: The current experimental status of the determination\nof |Vud |. The values of \u03bb from the four recent measurements\nare shown by four brackets along the \u03bb axis as well as the constraints from the world average of the neutron lifetime measurements as given by the Particle Data Group [10]. (Note\nthat the average given by the Particle Data Group [10] does\nnot include the recent measurement reported in Ref. [11].)\nThe combination of a \u03bb measurement and the neutron lifetime measurement determines the value of |Vud |. Also shown\nare the |Vud | determination from nuclear \u03b2 decay and the\n|Vud | determination from kaon and B-meson decays and the\nassumption of CKM unitarity.\n\nwhere me is the electron mass, Ee the electron energy,\npe the electron momentum, E\u03bd the neutrino energy, p\u03bd\nthe neutrino momentum, and \u03c3n the neutron spin. Coefficients a, A, and B depend only on \u03bb in the SM. Among\nd\u03bb\n= 2.6. a\nthem, A is the most sensitive to \u03bb with dA\nhas a similar but slightly reduced sensitivity to \u03bb with\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\nda = 3.3. B is much less sensitive to \u03bb with dB = 13.4.\nSo far, the determination of \u03bb from free neutron decay\nhas been provided by measurements of A. The uncertainty in \u03bb from the most precise measurement of a [5]\nis more than ten times larger than the uncertainty in \u03bb\nfrom the most precise measurement of A [6]. Therefore\nthe main focus of this review on is A measurements.\nThe current experimental situation is graphically summarized in Fig. 1. The precision with which the recent\nfour measurements [6, 7, 8, 9] determined the value of A\n(0.6 \u2212 1.6%) is not sufficient to make a determination of\n|Vud | from neutron \u03b2 decay with a precision comparable\nto that from nuclear \u03b2 decay. Furthermore, the agreement among the four measurements is poor. Clearly a\nnew measurement of A with a higher precision is warranted.\nA typical experimental arrangement for A coefficient\nmeasurements involves measuring the forward-backward\nasymmetry of electron emission with respect to the neutron spin in polarized neutron \u03b2 decay. Polarized neutrons (a beam of cold neutrons in almost all cases) are let\ndecay in a decay volume and electrons from the neutron\ndecay are guided by a strong magnetic field towards one\n\n1\nN1 (Ee ) \u2212 N2 (Ee )\n= P A\u03b2,\nN1 (Ee ) + N2 (Ee )\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Ee is the electron's energy, N1(2) is the count rate\nin detector 1(2), P is the average polarization of the neutrons, and \u03b2 is the velocity of the electron in the units of\nthe velocity of light.\nThree major sources of systematic uncertainties can be\nidentified in the previous experiments. They are (1) neutron polarization determination, (2) background, and (3)\ndetector effects including backscattering of \u03b2 particles.\nAs evident from Eq. 5, the polarization determination\nhas to be done to a precision better than the precision\nto which A is to be determined. Also, incomplete knowledge of the background signal will lead to an erroneous\ndetermination of N1(2) , thereby giving an erroneous determination of A. With regard to the detector effects,\ndue to the small end point energy of the electron spectrum (Ee0 = 782 keV), a significant fraction (\u223c 10% for\nplastic scintillation counters) of electrons from neutron\n\u03b2 decay directed to one detector can backscatter from\nthe surface of the detector and are detected by the other\ndetector. A non-negligible fraction of the backscattered\nelectrons leave undetectably small energy deposition in\nthe first detector, hence introducing an error in the asymmetry determination. (These electrons are called missed\nbackscattered electrons.) Understanding the backscattering of low energy electrons and properly characterizing\nthe detector response is clearly of vital importance.\nIn order to address the unsatisfactory situation represented in Fig. 1, measurements of A with a precision of \u03b4A/A = 0.2% or better are required (The uncertainty reported in Ref. [6] (PerkeoII experiment) is\n\u03b4A/A = 0.6%). Clearly, these measurements need to address the above-mentioned systematic issues. In Table I,\nmajor systematic corrections applied to the results of the\nrecent four measurements are listed. It is seen that corrections that are significantly larger than the reported\nuncertainty were applied. Experiments with low background, high polarization (> 99.9%), and small detector\neffects are highly desirable since they do not require large\ncorrections, thus improving the reliability of systematic\nerror assignment.\n\nONGOING AND FUTURE NEUTRON \u03b2-DECAY\nCORRELATION EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere are in fact several experiments ongoing or\nplanned to measure A with a higher precision.\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: Major systematic correction in the recent A measurements\nExperiment\n\nA\n\nPerkeo (1986)\nPNPI (1991)\nILL-TPC (1995)\nPerkeo II (2002)\n\n-0.1146(19)\n-0.1116(14)\n-0.1160(15)\n-0.1189(7)\n\na After\n\nSystematic corrections\nPolarization Background\n2.6%\n3%\n27%\nsmall\n1.9%\n3%\n1.1%\n0.5%a\n\nenvironmental background(15%) was subtracted.\n\nSince their last publication [6], Perkeo II collaboration\nhave implemented some upgrades, including a new ballistic supermirror guide for a higher neutron flux [12] and a\nnew crossed supermirror polarizers for a higher neutron\npolarization [13]. At the same time, a new experiment\nPerkeo III has been developed.\nThere are two major efforts under way to measure\nA in US. The UCNA experiment [14], currently being\ncommissioned at Los Alamos National Laboratory, aims\nat a 0.2% measurement of A using ultracold neutrons\n(UCNs).\nThe abBA collaboration proposes to perform a simultaneous measurements of a, A, B, and the Fierz interference term b (which is zero in the SM) at the Spallation\nNeutron Source (SNS) [15]. The goal of the abBA experiment is to determine a, A, B, and b with an absolute\nprecision of \u223c 10\u22124 In order to address known problems\nin previous experiments, the abBA experiment includes\nseveral new features such as, the use of pulsed neutron\nsource, the use of a polarized helium-3 transmission cell\nas a neutron polarizer, coincidence detection of the decay\nelectrons and the protons, and the use of segmented silicon detectors. Since in the SM, a, A, and B depends only\non \u03bb, the consistency among a, A, and B will provide a\npowerful check for potential systematics.\nThere are also efforts to improve the precision of a.\nThe aCORN experiment, being prepared at NIST, aims\nto determine a to a statistical precision of 1% or less by\nperforming coincidence detection of electrons and recoil\nprotons and selecting two kinematic regions such that a\ncomparison of the rates in the two regions directly yields\na measurement of a [16]. The aSPECT experiment, currently being developed at Mainz and will be run at ILL,\nwill measure the recoil proton energy spectrum using a\nmagnetic spectrometer with electrostatic retardation potentials [17]. The expected precision is \u03b4a/a = 0.25%.\nBelow, we discuss the UCNA experiment more in detail.\n\nUCNA Experiment\n\nThe goal of the UCNA experiment is a 0.2% measurement of A. Unlike previous experiments, which used a\n\nbeam of cold neutrons from a reactor, the UCNA experiment uses UCNs produced by a pulsed spallation UCNs\nsource [18]. UCNs are neutrons with total kinetic energy\nless than the effective potential UF presented by a material boundary. These neutrons, therefore, can be confined\nin a material bottle. Typically UF \u223c 200 neV, which\ncorresponds to velocities of order 5 m/s, wavelengths of\norder 500 \u00c5 and an effective temperature of order 2 mK.\nThere are two major advantages in using such a neutron source. First, the kinetic energy of UCN is so small\nthat the potential energy associated with the interaction\nof the neutron magnetic moment with a magnetic field\n(\u03bc * B) can be easily made comparable or even higher\nthan the kinetic energy using an electromagnet that can\nproduce a magnetic field of several Tesla (1.7 T field gives\n|\u03bc*B| = 100 neV ). Therefore, by passing UCNs through\na region with a large magnetic field (> 6 T), it is possible\nto filter out neutrons with one spin state, thereby making them 100% spin-polarized. Second, by operating the\naccelerator in a pulsed mode, it is possible to limit the\nemission of background radiation to the period in which\nthe beam pulse strikes the target. By performing a measurement only when there is no beam pulse striking the\ntarget, it is possible to perform a measurement with very\nlow background. This is a big advantage of spallation\nsources over reactor sources, which generate continuous\nbackground radiation.\nUCNs are produced by the LANSCE solid deuterium\nUCN source, sent through a polarizer/spin flipper, and\nthen introduced into a decay volume. The wall of the decay volume is a 3 m-long diamond coated quartz cylinder\n10 cm in diameter. The decay volume is in the warm bore\nof a superconducting solenoidal magnet, which provides\na holding field of 1 T. The decay electrons spiral along\nthe magnetic field lines towards one of the detectors, and\nthen enter the field expansion region, where the magnetic\nfield is reduced to 0.6 T. As an electron enters the field\nexpansion region, the energy associated with the angular motion of the electron is transfered to longitudinal\nmotion in order to conserve angular momentum as the\ndiameter of the spiral increases due to the reduced field.\nThis reduces the incident angle of the electron onto the\ndetector surface (reverse of the magnetic mirror effect)\nand suppresses backscattering. The detectors are placed\nin a region where the expanded field is uniform. The\nschematic of the UCNA experiment is shown in Fig. 2.\nEach electron detector is comprised of a thin\nlow-pressure multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC)\nplaced in front of a plastic scintillator. The MWPC consists of a thin front window (Kelvar supported 6 \u03bcm-thick\nMylar), a gas volume filled with neopentane, cathode\nplanes made of 50 \u03bcm diameter aluminum wires strung\nwith a 2.54 mm spacing, an anode plane made of 10 \u03bcm\ndiameter tungsten wires strung with a 2.54 mm spacing,\nand a thin exit window (6 \u03bcm-thick Mylar) [19]. The\nMWPC provides the position information with a resolu-\n\n\f4\nyear 2007.\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic of the UCNA Experiment.\n\nDetermination of |Vud | from neutron \u03b2 decay with an\nimproved precision will provide a useful cross check of\nthe current determination of |Vud | from nuclear \u03b2 decays.\nFurthermore, precision measurements of neutron decay\nparameters hold the most promise for a further improvement of the determination of |Vud |. Currently there are\na number of experiments ongoing and planned that will\ndetermine A and a to a relative precision of the order of\n0.1%, which, combined with a neutron life measurement\nwith a precision of 0.1%, provide a determination of |Vud |\nwith a similar precision to that from nuclear \u03b2 decay.\n\nElectronic address: ito@lanl.gov\n[1] J.

Also\nthe combination of the thin entrance window and the fact\nthat MWPCs are in general more sensitive to small energy depositions than plastic scintillator reduces the fraction of missed backscattered events. On top of this, detailed studies of low energy electron backscattering were\nperformed [20] to help build a reliable model of missed\nbackscattered events, which will be necessary in applying\na small correction due to the missed backscattered events\nto the final results. Furthermore, a small spectrometer\nwas built to provide a monoenergetic electron beam for\noff-line calibration of the detector system [21].\nFigure 3 shows an energy spectrum of the decay electrons from UCNs that the collaboration obtained during\ntheir 2006 commissioning run. This is the first \u03b2 decay spectrum measured with UCNs. The collaboration\nis hoping to make a 1 \u2212 2% measurement of A during\n\n\f"}
