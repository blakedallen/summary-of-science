INTRODUCTION\nWith the improving sensitivity limits of ground-based optical interferometers it is over time becoming more\nlikely that eruptive transients such as novae will be bright enough to be observed. The high angular resolution\nmeasurements that can be made with such systems should allow observers to directly probe some of the aspects\nof these explosions. Here we discuss three cases where such observations have been made.\nV838 Monocerotis is an explosive variable star that underwent a nova-like event in early 2002,1, 2 with a\npeak magnitude of mV \u223c 6.8 (Fig. 1). However, the eruption was unlike classical novae in that the effective\ntemperature of the object dropped and the spectral type evolved into a very late M and L type.3 The eruption\nmechanism of V838 Mon is not well understood, but is probably a new type of explosive variable. There have\nbeen many models proposed: the merger of a main-sequence binary star,4 a He-flash on a post-AGB star,5 or\neven the accretion of several planets.6\nClassical novae are energetic stellar explosions that occur in systems containing a white dwarf (WD) accreting\nmass from a late-type stellar companion.7 When the amount of accreted material on the surface of the white\nFurther author information: (Send correspondence to B.F.L.)\nB.F.L.: E-mail: blane@mit.edu, Telephone: 1 617 253 3429\n\n\fdwarf reaches some critical value a thermonuclear-runaway is ignited, giving rise to the observed nova outburst\nin which material enriched in heavy elements is ejected into the surrounding medium at high velocities.\nNova Aquilae 2005 (ASAS190512+0514.2, V1663 Aql) was discovered on 9 June 2005 by G. Pojmanski & A.\nOksanen.8 At the time of discovery the magnitude was mV = 11.05; the source reached mV \u223c 10.8 the following\nday, and declined in brightness thereafter. The time to decay 2 magnitudes (t2 ) was \u223c 16 days, making V1663\nAql a \"fast\" nova.9 Soon after discovery M. Dennefeld & F. Ricquebourg10 obtained an optical spectrum with\nfeatures indicating a heavily reddened nova. The H-\u03b1 emission lines exhibited P Cygni line profiles and indicated\nan expansion velocity in the range of 700 km s\u22121 (Dennefeld, personal communication) to 1000 km s\u22121 .11\nDirect observations of the expansion of the nova shell provide an opportunity to accurately determine the\ndistance to the nova. Such observations are usually only possible many years after the outburst, when the\nexpanding shell can be resolved. We have used the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) to resolve the 2.2\u03bcm\nemission from V1663 Aql and measure its apparent angular diameter as a function of time. We were able to\nfollow the expansion starting \u223c 9 days after the initial explosion; when combined with radial velocities derived\nfrom spectroscopy we are able to infer a distance and luminosity of the object.\nRecurrent novae are thought to consist of massive white dwarfs orbiting late-type giants; material is pulled\nfrom the giant and accreted onto the WD. As in the case of classical novae, a thermonuclear runaway reaction\nwill on occasion blow off large amounts of matter in a bright, rapid explosion. There are a small number of\nsystems which have been observed through multiple such outbursts, including RS Oph, which showed outbursts\nin 1898, 1933, 1958, 1967, 1985 and 2006. It has been argued12 that recurrent novae systems are the progenitors\nof Type Ia supernovae, as the short duration of the explosions indicate that the WD should be very close to the\nChandrasekhar limit.\nThe Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) was built by NASA/JPL as a testbed for developing ground-based\ninterferometry and is located on Palomar Mountain near San Diego, CA.13 It combines starlight from two out\nof three available 40-cm apertures and measures the resulting interference fringes (See Fig. 2 for representative\nuv-plane coverage). The high angular resolution provided by this long-baseline (85-110 m), near infrared (2.2\u03bcm)\ninterferometer is sufficient to resolve emission on the milli-arcsecond scale.\n\n2. OBSERVATIONS\nEach nightly observation with PTI consisted of one or more 130-second integrations during which the normalized\nfringe visibility of the science target was measured. The measured fringe visibilities of the science target were\ncalibrated by dividing them by the point-source response of the instrument, determined by interleaving observations of calibration sources; the calibration sources were chosen to be single stars, close to the target on the\nsky and to have angular diameters less than 2 milli-arcseconds, determined by fitting a black-body to archival\nbroadband photometry of the sources. For further details of the data-reduction process, see Colavita et al.14\nand Boden et al.15\nIn addition to measured fringe visibilities, we obtain K-band photometry using photon count rates from PTI\nand K-band magnitudes for the calibrator sources provided by 2MASS.16 Note that PTI was not designed with\nhigh-precision photometry in mind, and hence the K-magnitudes should be treated with some caution.\nWe observed V838 Mon on 7 nights between 5 November and 13 December 2004, using PTI in the standard\nK-band mode, with the 85-meter North-West (5 nights) and South-West (2 nights) baselines.\nWe observed V1663 Aql on 10 nights between 15 June 2005 and 28 June 2005; on six of those nights we\nobtained data on two or three interferometric baselines.\nWe observed RS Oph on 2 nights: 24 March and 2 April 2006. Preliminary examination indicates that the\nsource is resolved on our 85-meter baseline.\n\n\f1.1.2002\n\n1.5.2002\n\n1.9.2002\n\n1.1.2003\n\nBRIGHTNESS (V MAGNITUDE)\n\n4\n\n9\n\n14\n\n19\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n500\nJULIAN DATE (\u22122452000)\n\n600\n\n700\n\nFigure 1.

For the asymmetric cases we fit\nfor three parameters: size (\u03b8), inclination angle (\u03c6), and position angle (\u03c8). Inclination is defined such that a\nface-on disk has \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c8 is measured east of north. Following the approach of Eisner et al.,18 we include \u03c6\nand \u03c8 in our models of the brightness distribution via a simple coordinate transformation:\nu\u2032 =\n\nu sin \u03c8 + v cos \u03c8\n\n(2)\n\nv\u2032\n\ncos \u03c6 (v sin \u03c8 \u2212 u cos \u03c8)\n\n(3)\n\n=\n\nSubstitution of (u\u2032, v\u2032) for (u, v) in the expressions above yields models with inclination effects included.\nWe perform least-squares fits of uniform and inclined disk models to the measured fringe visibilities in order\nto derive sizes and inclination angles.\n\n4. RESULTS\n4.1. V838 Mon\nWe have published the results of our observations in a recent letter;17 we review these results here. We modeled\nthe 2.2\u03bcm emission from V838 Mon using several simple emission morphologies, including face-on and inclined\ndisks and binary models. We find that the best fits to the data are provided by inclined disk or two-component\nmodels. One possibility indicated by the data is that the observed K-band emission is produced by a very\nelongated structure similar to an edge-on disk. The projected linear dimensions of such a source are approximately\n+3.0\n+2\n+24\n3.5+0.2\n\u22121.5 \u00d7 0.07\u22120.07 milli-arcseconds (28\u221213 \u00d7 0.5\u22120.6 AU).\n\nWe suggest that the observed emission from V838 Mon was due to ejecta produced during the eruption.

The\nsimple uniform-disk model shown does not match the data particularly well, indicating that the source is more complicated\nthan a simple uniform disk.\n\nthe time elapsed since outburst of \u223c 108 s, the distance between the ejecta and the star should be in the range\n30\u2013220 AU. This range is consistent with the projected separations we measure. It is also likely that the ejecta\nare not uniformly distributed, and hence the binary morphology preferred by the data may be \"clumpiness\" in\nthe ejecta.\n\n4.2. V1663 Aql\nWe resolved the emission from V1663 Aql on several nights, and find that the measured fringe visibilities generally\ndecrease with time. This implies that the source is expanding. We also find that the data on nights with more\nthan one available baseline are not well matched by a simple uniform disk model, see Fig. 6; in effect the visibility\nin the \"North-South\" baseline is too high to be consistent with the \"North-West\" and \"South-West\" baselines.\nThere are two morphologies that can fit the observations: the first is an elliptical disk, with an aspect ratio of\n\u223c 1.4:1 (an example of such a fit is shown in Fig. 5), the second is a centrally condensed source. We are currently\nworking to further refine models of the emission from this system.\nThe measured change in apparent angular size is approximately 0.2 mas/day (see Fig. 7); this can be combined\nwith the observed radial expansion velocity inferred from spectroscopic observations to determine the geometric\ndistance to this nova d \u223c 5.5 \u00b1 1 kpc. In addition, by extrapolating the linear expansion trend backward in time\nwe can derive the time of the initial explosion: MJD 53526.5 \u00b1 1.3 d. Finally, we note that the two last data\npoints in our series do not follow the simple expansion trend of the previous points. We suggest that we are\nseeing the optical depth of the ejecta drop, allowing emission from further inside the fireball to escape.\n\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nIn the past two years we have used the Palomar Testbed Interferometer to observe three eruptive variable stars:\nV838 Mon (peculiar variable), V1663 Aql (classical nova) and RS Oph (recurrent nova). In each case we were\nable to resolve the emission and measure its angular size. In the case of V1663 Aql we were able to follow the\n\n\fUD Model Diameter (mas)\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n53535\n\n53538\n\n53541\n\n53544\n\n53547\n\n53550\n\nTime (MJD)\nFigure 7.
