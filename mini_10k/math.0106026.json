Fix J \u2208 J (M, \u03c9) (the contractible space of all almost complex structures on M compatible with \u03c9), and let h and g = R(h) be the\ninduced hermitian and riemannian structures. There exist an hermitian line\nbundle (A, h) on M and a unitary covariant derivative \u2207A on A, such that\n\u22122\u03c0i\u03c9 is the curvature of \u2207A . In this set-up, studying the asymptotic spectral properties of a suitable renormalized laplacian, Guillemin and Uribe have\nintroduced privileged spaces of sections H(M, A\u2297k ) \u2286 C \u221e (M, A\u2297k ); if J is integrable and A holomorphic and ample, these are the spaces of holomorphic\nsections of A\u2297m [BG], [GU], [BU1]. These linear series determine projective embeddings of M enjoying the same metric and symplectic asymptotic\nproperties as in the integrable projective case [BU2], [Z], [SZ2], [T].\nSuppose that G is a finite group with a symplectic action \u03bd : G\u00d7M \u2192 M,\nso that J may be chosen G-invariant. Then \u03bd preserves g and h. Assume also\nthat \u03bd lifts to a linear action \u03bd\u0303 : G \u00d7 A \u2192 A, and that \u03bd\u0303 preserves hA and\n\u2207A . Then \u03bd\u0303 preserves each of the spaces H(M, A\u2297N ). Let \u03c1i : G \u2192 GL(Vi ),\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 c, be the irreducible representations of G; we shall assume that\ni = 1 corresponds to the trivial one-dimensional representation.\nFor each N,\nLc\nwe have a G-equivariant decomposition H(M, A\u2297N ) =\nH(M,\nA\u2297N )i ,\ni=1\nAddress.

It is natural to\nask whether the linear series |H(M, A\u2297N )i | are base point free and, if so,\nwhat about their asymptotic properties? In this note, we apply arguments\nfrom [BU2] and [Z], [SZ2] to these questions.\nIf x \u2208 M, let Gx = {g \u2208 G : g * x = x} be its stabiliser. Let \u03c7i : G \u2192 C\nbe the character of the i-th irreducible representation. Let Ax be the fibre of\nA over x \u2208 M. Clearly, Gx acts on Ax and thus we have a unitary character\n\u03b1x : Gx \u2192 S 1 \u2282 C\u2217 . Let\nX\n\u03b1x (g)N * \u03c7i (g), (x \u2208 M, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 c, N \u2208 N)\n\u03b3i,N (x) := (\u03b1xN , \u03c7i )Gx =\ng\u2208Gx\n\n( , )Gx denoting the L2 -product with respect to the counting measure on Gx .\nNote that \u03b3i,N = \u03b3i,N +|G| for every i and N, where |G| denotes the order of\nG. Set\nBi,N := {x \u2208 M : \u03b3i,N (x) = 0} = Bi,N +|G|\n\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 c).\n\nClearly, x \u2208 Bi,N implies Gx 6= {e}.\nOur first goal is to determine the base locus of the spaces of sections\nH(M, A\u2297k )i for k \u226b 0. In algebro-geometric terminology, the base locus of\na vector subspace W \u2286 C \u221e (M, A\u2297N ) is\nBs(|W |) := {x \u2208 M : s(x) = 0 \u2200 s \u2208 W }.\nTo begin with, we shall prove:\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose 1 \u2264 i \u2264 c, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 |G| \u2212 1, x \u2208 M and \u03b3i,r (x) 6= 0.\nThen for N \u226b 0, N \u2261 r (mod |G|) there exists a section s \u2208 H(M, A\u2297N )i\nsuch that s(x) 6= 0.\nThis has a number of consequences:\nCorollary 1.1. Suppose that the action of G on M is effective. Then\ndim(H(M, A\u2297k )i ) > 0\nfor every i = 1, . . . , c and every k \u226b 0.\nIn fact, it is proved in [P] that under the same hypothesis\ndim(H(M, A\u2297k )i ) =\n\ndim(Vi )2 k n\n*\n* c1 (A)n + o(k n ).\n|G|\nn!\n\n2\n\n\fProposition 1.1. Suppose 1 \u2264 i \u2264 c, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 |G| \u2212 1, and \u03b3i,r (x) 6= 0\nfor every x \u2208 M. Then H(M, A\u2297k )i globally generates A\u2297k if k \u226b 0 and\nk \u2261 r (mod |G|), that is, for every x \u2208 M there is s \u2208 H(M, A\u2297k )i such that\ns(x) 6= 0.\nCorollary 1.2. If k \u226b 0 and i = 1, . . . , c, the subspace of G-invariant\nsections\nH(M, A\u2297k|G|)G \u2286 H(M, A\u2297k|G| )\nglobally generates A\u2297k|G| .\nCorollary 1.3. If M is a complex projective manifold and A is ample, for\u0001\nevery i = 1, . . . , c and r = 0, . . . , |G|\u22121 the base loci Bs |H 0(M, A\u2297(r+k|G|) )i |\nstabilize for k \u226b 0. Furthermore, for every k \u226b 0,\n\u0001\nBs |H 0(M, A\u2297(r+k|G|) )i | \u2286 Bi,r .\nIn the reverse direction, it is easily seen that if Gx = G and there exists\ns \u2208 C \u221e (M, A\u2297N )i with s(x) 6= 0, then\n(\u03b1xN , \u03c7i )G 6= 0.\nTherefore,\nCorollary 1.4. In the hypothesis of Corollary 1.3, suppose in addition that\neither Gx = {e} or Gx = G for every x \u2208 G. Then\n\u0001\nBs |H(M, A\u2297N )i | = Bi,N\nfor i = 1, . . . , c and N \u226b 0.\nIn the almost complex case, for any i = 1, . . . , c and r = 0, . . . , |G| \u2212 1\nwe may still define the (i, r)-th equivariant asymptotic base locus of A as\nBs(A, i, r)\u221e =: {x \u2208 M : \u2200s > 0 \u2203 k > s, k \u2261 r (mod.|G|)\n\u0001\nsuch that x \u2208 Bs |H(M, A\u2297k )i | .\nThe general case (symplectic, almost complex) of Corollary 1.3 is then\nCorollary 1.5. In the above situation,\nBs(A, i, r)\u221e \u2286 Bi,r .\nIf furthermore K \u2282 M is any compact subset with K \u2229 Bi,r = \u2205, then\n\u0001\nK \u2229 Bs |H(M, A\u2297k )i | = \u2205\nfor all k \u226b 0 with k \u2261 r (mod. |G|).\n3\n\n\fNext, if Bi,r = \u2205 there are associated projective morphisms\n\u03a6i,r+k|G| : M \u2192 P(H(M, A\u2297(r+k|G|))\u2217i ),\nand we now consider their asymptotic properties as k \u2192 +\u221e.\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose Bi,r = \u2205 for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 c and 0 \u2264 r \u2264 |G| \u2212 1.\nLet U \u2286 M be the open subset of M where the order |Gx | is locally constant.\nSuppose U \u2032 \u2282 U is open with U \u2032 \u2282 U. Then \u03a6i,r+k|G| is an immersion on U \u2032\nfor k \u226b 0.\nCorollary 1.6. |H(M, A\u2297N )G | is base P\npoint free and \u03a61,N is an immersion\non compact subsets of U if N \u226b 0 and g\u2208Gx \u03b1x (g)N 6= 0 for every x \u2208 G.\nIn general \u03a6i,N is not injective; for example it is constant on every orbit\nfor any G if i corresponds to the trivial representation, or for any i if G is\nabelian. We may still ask, however, if in these cases points in different orbits\nhave different images under \u03a6i,N .\nLet dG : M \u00d7 M \u2192 R be the orbit distance:\ndG (x, y) := min{d(gx, y) : g \u2208 G}\n\n(x, y \u2208 M).\n\nClearly, dG (x, y) > 0 if and only if x 6\u2208 G * y.\nProposition 1.2. Assume that either G is abelian, or G is arbitrary and\ni = 1. Let U \u2286 M be as in Theorem 1.1, N \u2208 N and suppose that Bi,N = \u2205\nand that \u03b3i,N is constant on W . Let K \u2286 W be a compact subset. There\nexists k0 \u2208 N such that if k \u2265 k0 , x, y \u2208 K and dG (x, y) > 0 then\n\u03a6i,N +k|G| (x) 6= \u03a6i,N +k|G|(y).\nCorollary 1.7. If the action of G on M\u0001 is free, then \u03a6i,N is well-defined and\n\u2217\nan embedding M/G \u0592\u2192 P H(M, A\u2297k )G for any i = 1, . . . , c and N \u226b 0.\nSimilar statements hold for the asymptotic metric and almost complex\nproperties, in the vein of theorem 1.1 of [BU2].\n\n2\n\nProofs\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1. We recall some notation from [BU2], [Z], [SZ2]. Let\nA\u2217 = A\u22121 be the dual line bundle with the induced hermitian stucture hA\u2217 ,\n\u03c0\nand let A\u2217 \u2283 S \u2192 M be the unit circle bundle, a strictly pseudoconvex\n4\n\n\fdomain. Given the connection, S has natural riemannian and almost CR\nstructures. We shall identify functions and L\nhalf-forms throughout.\n1\n\u221e\nAs S is a principal S -bundle, C (S) = N \u2208Z C \u221e (S)N , where C \u221e (S)N is\nthe N-th isotype for the S 1 -action. In the standard\nmanner, we shall identify\nL\n\u223c\nC \u221e (M, A\u2297N ) and C \u221e (S)N . Set H(S) :=\nH(S)\nN , where H(S)N =\nN \u2208N\nH(M, A\u2297N ) under this identification; in the integrable projective case, H(S)\nis the Hardy space of boundary values of holomorphic functions on A\u2217 . Let\n\u2032\n\u03a0 : L2 (S) \u2192 H(S) be the orthogonal\n(S \u00d7 S) its\nLprojector and \u03a0\u0303 \u2208 D \u221e\nSchwartz kernel; decompose it as \u03a0\u0303 = N \u2208N \u03a0\u0303N , where \u03a0\u0303N \u2208 C (S \u00d7 S) is\nPN N\nsi (x) \u2297 sN\nthe N-th Fourier coefficent. We have \u03a0\u0303N (x, y) = di=0\ni (y), where\nN\nN\n{s0 , . . . , sdN } is an orthonormal basis of H(S)N . Let \u03a6\u0303i,N : S \u2192 H(M, A\u2297N )\u2217\nbe the coherent state map, given by evaluation, which is a \u0001lifting of \u03a6i,N when\nthe latter is defined. Then \u03a0\u0303N (p, q) = \u03a6\u0303i,N (p), \u03a6\u0303i,N (q) (p, q \u2208 S), where\n(* , *) denotes the L2 -hermitian product on H(M, A\u2297N )\u2217 .\nThe induced action of G on A\u2217 preserves S and the riemannian and almost\nCR structures on S, and the isomorphisms H(S)N \u223c\n= H(M, A\u2297N ) are Gequivariant.\nFor N \u226b 0, we have G-equivariant decompositions H(S)N =\nL\ni H(S)i,N , where H(S)i,N is the factor\nL consisting of a direct sum of copies\nof Vi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 c. Similarly, H(S) = i H(S)i . We shall implicitly identify\nH(S)N and H(S)i,N with H(M, A\u2297N ) and H(M, A\u2297N )i , respectively. For\neach i, let \u03a0i : L2 (S) \u2192 H(S)i denote the orthogonal projection and let\n\u03a0\u0303i \u2208 D \u2032 (S \u00d7 S) be its Schwartz kernel. For each i and N, let \u03a0i,N : L2 (S) \u2192\nH(S)i,N be the orthogonal pojection and \u03a0\u0303i,N its Schwartz kernel, the N(i,N )\n(i,N )\nth Fourier coefficient of \u03a0\u0303i : if {s0 , . . . , sdi,N } is an orthonormal basis of\nH(S)i,N , then\n\u03a0\u0303i,N (p, q) =\n\ndi,N\nX\n\n(i,N )\n\nsj\n\n(i,N )\n\n(p) \u2297 sj\n\n(q)\n\n(p, q \u2208 S).\n\nj=0\n\nP\nClearly, \u03a0\u0303 = ci=1 \u03a0\u0303i . Notice that the Fourier components of the total and\nequivariant Szeg\u00f6 kernels, \u03a0N and \u03a0i,N , when restricted to the diagonal in\nS \u00d7 S descend to well-defined smooth functions on the diagonal in M \u00d7 M,\nthat is, we may write with some abuse of language \u03a0N (p, p) = \u03a0N (x, x) and\n\u03a0i,N (p, p) = \u03a0i,N (x, x) for any p \u2208 S and x \u2208 M with \u03c0(p) = x. This will be\ndone implicitly below.\nBy the projection formula, for each i = 1, . . . , c we have\n\u03a0\u0303i,N =\n\ndN\nX\n\nN\n\u03a0i (sN\nj ) \u2297 sj = (dim(Vi )/|G|) *\n\nXX\ng\n\nj=0\n\n5\n\nj\n\nN\n\u03c7i (g)\u03c1(g)(sN\nj ) \u2297 sj ,\n\n\fwhere \u03c1 : G \u2192 GL(H(S)N ) is the induced representation; explicitly, \u03c1(g)\u03c3 =\n\u03c3 \u25e6 g \u22121 (g \u2208 G, \u03c3 \u2208 H(S)N ), where we view g \u22121 as a contactomorphism of S.\nThus,\nXX\n\u22121\nN\n\u03a0\u0303i,N (p, q) = (dim(Vi )/|G|) *\n\u03c7i (g)sN\nj (g p)sj (q)\ng\n\nj\n\n= (dim(Vi )/|G|) *\n\nX\n\n\u03c7i (g)\u03a0\u0303N (g \u22121 p, q).\n\ng\n\nP\nOn the diagonal, \u03a0\u0303i,N (p, p) = (dim(Vi )/|G|) * g \u03c7i (g)\u03a0\u0303N (g \u22121 p, p). Let d be\nthe geodesic distance function on M and also its pull-back d \u25e6 \u03c0 to S. If\nx \u2208 M and G * x 6= {x}, set ax := min{d(gx, x) : g \u2208 G \\ Gx }.

By\n(13) of [SZ1] and the definition of dual action, \u03a0\u0303N (g \u22121p, p) = \u03b1x (g)N \u03a0\u0303N (p, p)\nif g \u2208 Gx .

This clearly implies the statement.\nProof Of Corollary 1.1. Let V \u2286 M be the locus of points with non-trivial\nstabilizer. By Theorem 8.1 on page 213 of [S] and because the action is\neffective, V is a union of proper submanifolds of M. If x \u2208 M \\ V , then\nGx = {e} and therefore \u03b3i,k (x) = dim(Vi ) 6= 0 for every i and N. By the\nTheorem, there exists s \u2208 H(M, A\u2297k )i with s(x) 6= 0 if k \u226b 0.\nBefore coming to the proof of Proposition 1.1, let us dwell on the previous\ndescrition of the equivariant Szeg\u00f6 kernels \u03a0\u0303i,k restricted to the diagonal. As\nis well-known, the wave front of the Szeg\u00f6 kernel \u03a0 is\n\b\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03a3 = (p, p), (r\u03b1p, \u2212r\u03b1p ) : p \u2208 S, r > 0 \u2286 T \u2217 (S \u00d7 S) \\ {0}.\n6\n\n\fIn the notation of [BG], [BU2] we have in fact \u03a0 \u2208 J 1/2 (S \u00d7 S, \u03a3). Now we\nhave seen that\nX\n\u03a0\u0303i,N (p, p) = (dim(Vi )/|G|) *\n\u03c7i (g)\u03a0\u0303N (g \u22121 p, p).\ng\u2208G\n\nFor any g \u2208 G let \u03b1g : S \u00d7 S \u2192 S \u00d7 S be the diffeomorphism (p, q) 7\u2192 (g p, q),\nand let \u03a0\u0303g = \u03a0\u0303 \u25e6 \u03b1g\u2217 \u2208 D \u2032 (S \u00d7 S), where \u03b1g\u2217 denotes pull-back of functions\n\u0001\nunder \u03b1g . Then \u03a0\u0303g \u2208 J 1/2 S \u00d7 S, \u03b1g\u2217 (\u03a3) and \u03a0\u0303k (g p, q) is the k-th Fourier\ncomponent of \u03a0\u0303g , for every integer k. One can then see, arguing as in the\nproofs of Lemmas 3.5 and 3.6 of [BU2], that k \u2212n \u03a0\u0303k (g p, p) is bounded in C 1\nnorm, say, for every g \u2208 G. The same then holds for k \u2212n \u03a0\u0303i,k (x, x).\nProof of Proposition 1.1. By the above, in the hypothesis of the Proposition\n\u0001\nfor every x \u2208 M there exists kx \u2208 N such that x 6\u2208 Bs |H(M, A\u2297k )i | for every\nk \u2265 kx . We now make the stronger claim that for every x \u2208 M there exist\n\u0001 an\n\u2297k\nopen neighbourhood Ux of x and kx \u2208 N such that Ux \u2229Bs |H(M, A )i | = \u2205\nfor every k \u2265 kx . The statement will follow given the compactness of M.\nIf the claim was false, there would exist x \u2208 M and sequences kj \u2208 N and\nxj \u2208 M (j = 1, 2, . . . ) with\u0001kj \u2261 r (mod |G|), kj \u2192 +\u221e and xj \u2192 x, such\nthat xj \u2208 Bs |H(M, A\u2297kj )i | for every j. Thus,\n\u03a0\u0303i,kj (xj , xj ) = 0\nwhile\n\u03a0\u0303i,kj (x, x) =\n\n(j = 1, 2, . . . )\n\ndim(Vi )\n* \u03b3i,r (x) * \u03a0\u0303kj (x, x) + L.O.T.,\n|G|\n\nwhere L.O.T. denotes lower order terms in kj . Thus, kj\u2212n \u03a0\u0303i,kj (x, x) is bounded\naway from zero and therefore the derivatives in x of the sequence of functions\nkj\u2212n \u03a0\u0303i,kj (x\u2032 , x\u2032 ) are unbounded, a contradiction.\nProof of Corollary 1.2. Let us agree that the irreducible representation corresponding to i = 1 is just the trivial representation, so that\nH(M, A\u2297N )1 = H(M, A\u2297N )G\nfor every integer N. Then \u03c71 (g) = 1 for every g \u2208 G. Furthermore, for every\nk|G|\nx \u2208 M, g \u2208 Gx and k \u2208 N we have \u03b1x (g) = 1. Thus\n\u03b31,k|G|(x) = |Gx | =\n6 0 for every x \u2208 M,\nand the statement follows from Proposition 1.1.\n7\n\n\fProof of Corollary 1.3. If M is a complex projective manifold and A is ample,\nwe have section multiplication maps\nH 0 (M, A\u2297l )G \u2297 H 0 (M, A\u2297m )i \u2212\u2192 H 0 (M, A\u2297(l+m) )i\nfor every i = 1, . . . , c and integers l, m. Thus, for any residue class 0 \u2264 r \u2264\n|G| \u2212 1 and any sequence of positive integers ki \u226b 0, by Corollary 1.2 we\nhave a descending chain of base loci:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nBs |H 0(M, A\u2297r )i | \u2287 Bs |H 0(M, A\u2297(r+k1 |G|) )i | \u2287\n\u0001\nBs |H 0 (M, A\u2297(r+(k1 +k2 )|G|) )i | \u2287 . . . .\nThis implies the first statement. The rest is obvious.\nProof of Corollary 1.4. If Gx = G and k \u2261 r (mod. |G|), then\n\u03a0\u0303i,k (x, x) =\n\ndim(Vi )\n* \u03b3i,r (x) * \u03a0\u0303k (p, p).\n|G|\n\nThus, if \u03b3i,r (x) = 0 then s(x) = 0 for every s \u2208 H(M, A\u2297k )i .\nProof of Corollary 1.5. The first statement follows from Theorem 1.1, while\nthe second is a consequence of the proof of Proposition 1.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Suppose Bi,N = \u2205 so that, perhaps after replacing\nN by N + k|G| for k \u226b 0, |H(S)i,N | is base point free. The claim is that\nif U \u2032 \u2282 U is open with compact closure in U and N \u226b 0, then \u03a6i,N is an\n(N )\nimmersion on U \u2032 . We shall be done by proving that N \u22121 \u03a6\u2217i,N (\u03c9FS ) \u2212 \u03c9 =\n(N )\nO(1/N) on connected compact subsets of U, where \u03c9FS is the Fubini-Study\nsymplectic form on P H(M, A\u2297k )\u2217 ). In turn, this will follow if we prove that\nN \u22121 \u03a6\u0303\u2217i,N (\u03c9\u0303N ) \u2212 \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03c9) = O(1/N) on horizontal vectors, over compact subsets\nof S; here \u03c9\u0303N = 2i \u2202\u2202 log |\u03be|2 on H(M, A\u2297k )\u2217 \\ {0} (with its natural hermitian\nstructure), and \u03c0 : S \u2192 M is the projection.\nNow, if d1 and d2 denote exterior differentiation on the first and second\ncomponent of S \u00d7 S, respectively, then N \u22121 \u03a6\u0303\u2217i,N \u03c9\u0303N = diag\u2217 (d1 d2 log \u03a0\u0303i,N ),\nwhere diag : S \u2192 S \u00d7 S is the diagonal map ([SZ2], proof of theorem 3.1 (b)).\nIf x, y \u2208 M lie in the same connected component V of U, Gy = Gx . Thus\nbx := (\u03b1xN , \u03c7i )Gx is constant on V , say equal to bV . Hence, if p, q \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (V )\nand x = \u03c0(p),\n\u03a0\u0303i,N (p, q) =\n\no\nX\ndim(Vi ) n\n* bV * \u03a0\u0303N (p, q) +\n\u03c7i (g)\u03a0\u0303N (gp, q) .\n|G|\ng6\u2208G\nx\n\n8\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u0001\nBy the proof of theorem 3.1 (b) of [SZ2], (i/2N)diag\u2217 d1 d2 log \u03a0N \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9\nin C k -norm for any k on M. Therefore, we shall be done by proving that\n\u0001\nN \u22121 d1 d2 \u03a0\u0303N (gp, q)/\u03a0\u0303N (p, q) \u2192 0\n(2)\nand\n\u0001\n\u0001\nN \u22121 d1 ( \u03a0\u0303N (gp, q)/\u03a0\u0303N (p, q) \u2227 d2 ( \u03a0\u0303N (g \u2032p, q)/\u03a0\u0303N (p, q) \u2192 0\n\n(3)\n\nfor g, g \u2032 6\u2208 Gx near compact subsets of diag(V ).\nLet then K \u2282 V be a compact subset, and suppose x \u2208 K, g 6\u2208 Gx , and\nu, v \u2208 Tx M have unit length. Let U, V be horizontal vector fields of unit\nlength on S, of unit length near Sx and extending the horizontal lifts of u\nand v. We want to estimate N \u22121 U1 \u25e6 V2 (\u03a0\u0303N (gp, q)/\u03a0\u0303N (p, q)) over K, where\nU1 = (U, 0) and V2 = (0, V ) are horizontal vector fields on S \u00d7 S.\nLet us consider again the distribution \u03a0\u0303g = \u03b1g\u2217 \u03a0\u0303 \u2208 J 1/2 (S \u00d7 S, g \u2217 \u03a3),\ndiscussed before the proof of Proposition 1.1. If P is a horizontal differential\noperator of degree l on S \u00d7 S, its principal symbol vanishes on g \u2217 \u03a3 and\ntherefore P (\u03a0\u0303g ) \u2208 J (l+1)/2 (S \u00d7 S, \u03b1g\u2217 \u03a3). As in [BU2] Lemma 4.5, for k \u2208 N\nwe can find \u03bdg,P,k \u2208 C \u221e (S), having an asymptotic development \u03bdg,P,k (p) =\nP\u221e n+(l\u2212j)/2 (j)\nfg,P,k (p), and real phase functions \u03b1g,P,k \u2208 C \u221e (S \u00d7 S) such\nj=0 k\nthat\nX\n2\nG(p, q) =\n\u03bdg,P,k (p)ei\u03b1g,P,k (p,q) e\u2212kd(gp,q) /2 \u2208 J (l+1)/2 (S \u00d7 S, \u03b1g\u2217 \u03a3)\nk\n\nand P (\u03a0\u0303g ) \u2212 G \u2208 J l/2 (S \u00d7 S, \u03b1g\u2217 \u03a3). Since P (\u03a0\u0303g ) has definite (even) parity,\nwe may assume without loss that so does G. Therefore, the above asymptotic expansions may be assumed to go down by integer steps: \u03bdg,P,k (p) =\nP\u221e n+l/2\u2212j (j)\nfg,P,k (p), and\nj=0 k\nP \u03a0\u0303N (gp, q)\n\n\u0001\n\n2 /2\n\n= \u03bdg,P,0 (p) * e\u2212N d(gp,q)\n\n+ O(N n+l/2\u22121 ).\n\n(4)\n\nBecause K \u2282 U is compact and g 6\u2208 Gx for x \u2208 K, there is \u01eb > 0 such\n(g)\nthat d(gp, p) > \u01eb for all p \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (K). Thus, P (\u03a0\u0303N )(p, p) = O(N m+(l\u22121)/2 ) on\n\u03c0 \u22121 (K). Developping N \u22121 U1 \u25e6 V2 (\u03a0\u0303N (gp, q)/\u03a0\u0303N (p, q)), we see that N \u22121 U1 \u25e6\nV2 (\u03a0\u0303N (gp, q)/\u03a0\u0303N (p, q)) = O(1/N) over K, uniformly in U and V . This\nproves (2); the proof of the other estimate is similar.\nProof of Proposition 1.2. Notation being as above, we may assume that K\nis G-invariant. Suppose then, by contradiction, that for a sequence kj \u2192\n+\u221e we can find xkj , ykj \u2208 K with dG (xkj , ykj ) > 0 and \u03a6i,N +kj |G| (xkj ) =\n\u03a6i,N +kj |G| (ykj ). Set Nj = N + kj |G|.\n9\n\n\fp\nI claim that dG (xkj , ykj ) \u2264 C/ Nj . Following [BU2], proof of Corollary\n4.6, pick pkj \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (xkj ), qkj \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (ykj ). Then \u03a6\u0303i,Nj (xkj ) = \u03bbj \u03a6\u0303i,Nj (ykj ) for\nsome \u03bbj \u2208 C; it follows that ||\u03a6\u0303i,Nj (pkj )||2 = |\u03bbj |2 * ||\u03a6\u0303i,Nj (qkj )||2 . However,\n||\u03a6\u0303i,Nj (p)||2 = \u03a0\u0303i,Nj (p, p) (p \u2208 S), and therefore by (1) above |\u03bbj | = 1 +\n\u22121/2\nO(Nj ). We also have |\u03bbj |\u03a0\u0303i,Nj (pkj , pkj ) = |\u03a0\u0303i,Nj (pkj , qkj )|, and on the\nother hand, again by (1),\n2 /2\n\n|\u03a0\u0303i,Nj (pkj , qkj )| \u2264 C|\u03a0\u0303i,Nj (pkj , pkj )|e\u2212Nj dG (p,q)\n\nn\u22121/2\n\n+ O(kj\n\n).\n\np\nWe conclude that dG (pkj , qkj ) \u2264 C/ kj , as claimed. Hence, after replacing\np\nxkj by gj * xkj for a suitable gj \u2208 G, we may assume d(xkj , ykj ) \u2264 C/ Nj\nand d(xkj , ykj ) = dG (xkj , ykj ) for every j.\nSince d(gx, x) > \u01eb for some fixed \u01eb > 0 and all x \u2208 K and g 6\u2208 Gx , xkj is\nthe only point in G * xkj minimizing the distance from ykj , for every j.\nWe may now apply the argument of the proof of theorem 3.2 (b) of [SZ2],\nwith minor changes.\n\nReferences\n[BU1]\n\nD.
