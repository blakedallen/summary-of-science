We prove a new version of the hard Lefschetz theorem\nfor even translation invariant continuous valuations, and discuss problems of integral geometry staying behind these properties. Then we\nformulate a conjectural analogue of this result for odd valuations.\n\n0\n\nIntroduction.\n\nIn this article we continue studying properties of the multiplicative structure\non valuations introduced in [3]. In [4] we have proven a certain version of the\nhard Lefschetz theorem for translation invariant even continuous valuations.\nIts statement is recalled in Section 4 of this article (Theorem 4.1). The\nmain result of this article is Theorem 2.1 where we prove yet another version\nof it for even valuations which is more closely related to the multiplicative\nstructure. As a consequence, we obtain a version of it for valuations invariant\nunder a compact group acting transitively on the unit sphere and containing\nthe operator \u2212Id (Corollary 2.5). Then in Section 3 we state a conjecture\nwhich is an analogue of the hard Lefschetz theorem for odd valuations.\nIt turns out that behind the hard Lefschetz theorem for even valuations\nstay results about the Radon and the cosine transforms on the Grassmannians\n(see the proof of Theorem 2.1 in this article, and also the proof of Theorem\n1.1.1 in [4] which is also a version of the hard Lefschetz theorem). One\n1\n\n\fpasses from even valuations to functions on Grassmannians using the KlainSchneider imbedding (see Section 1). The case of odd valuations turns out\nto be related to integral geometry on partial flags which seems to be not well\nunderstood. On the other hand, various integral geometric transformations\non such spaces can be interpreted sometimes as intertwining operators (or\ntheir compositions) for certain representations of GLn (R), and thus can be\nreduced to a question of representation theory. This point of view was partly\nused in [6] in the study of the cosine transform on the Grassmannians, and\nmore explicitly in [5] in the study of the generalized cosine transform. It\nwould be of interest to understand these problems for odd valuations.\nNote also that the connection between the hard Lefschetz theorem for\nvaluations and integral geometry turns out to be useful in both directions.\nThus in [4] it was applied to obtain an explicit classification of unitarily\ninvariant translation invariant continuous valuations.\nFor the general background on convexity we refer to the book by Schneider [22]. For the classical theory of valuations we refer to the surveys by\nMcMullen and Schneider [21] and McMullen [20].\n\n1\n\nBackground.\n\nIn this section we recall some definitions and known results. Let V be a real\nvector space of finite dimension n. Let K(V ) denote the family of convex\ncompact subsets of V .\n1.1 Definition. 1) A function \u03c6 : K(V ) \u2192 C is called a valuation if for any\nK1 , K2 \u2208 K(V ) such that their union is also convex one has\n\u03c6(K1 \u222a K2 ) = \u03c6(K1 ) + \u03c6(K2 ) \u2212 \u03c6(K1 \u2229 K2 ).\n2) A valuation \u03c6 is called continuous if it is continuous with respect the\nHausdorff metric on K(V ).\n3) A valuation \u03c6 is called translation invariant if \u03c6(K + x) = \u03c6(K) for\nevery x \u2208 V and every K \u2208 K(V ).\n4) A valuation \u03c6 is called even if \u03c6(\u2212K) = \u03c6(K) for every K \u2208 K(V ).\n5) A valuation \u03c6 is called homogeneous of degree k (or k-homogeneous)\nif for every K \u2208 K(V ) and every scalar \u03bb \u2265 0, we have \u03c6(\u03bb * K) = \u03bbk \u03c6(K).\nWe will denote by V al(V ) the space of translation invariant continuous\nvaluations on V . Equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on\n2\n\n\fcompact subsets of K(V ) it becomes a Fr\u00e9chet space. We will also denote by\nV alk (V ) the subspace of k-homogeneous valuations from V al(V ). We will\nneed the following result due to P. McMullen [18].\n1.2 Theorem ([18]). The space V al(V ) decomposes as follows\nV al(V ) =\n\nn\nM\n\nV alk (V )\n\nk=0\n\nwhere n = dim V .\nIn particular note that the degree of homogeneity is an integer between\n0 and n = dim V . It is known that V al0 (V ) is one-dimensional and it is\nspanned by the Euler characteristic \u03c7, and V aln (V ) is also one-dimensional\nand is spanned by a Lebesgue measure [13]. One has a further decomposition\nwith respect to parity:\nV alk (V ) = V alkev (V ) \u2295 V alkodd (V ),\nwhere V alkev (V ) is the subspace of even k-homogeneous valuations, and V alkodd (V )\nis the subspace of odd k-homogeneous valuations.\nLet us recall the imbedding of the space of valuations into the spaces\nof functions on partial flags essentially due to D. Klain [14], [15] and R.\nSchneider [23]. It will be used in Section 2 to reduce the hard Lefschetz\ntheorem for even valuations to integral geometry of Grassmannians.\nLet us denote by Gri (V ) the Grassmannian of real linear i-dimensional\nsubspaces in V . For a manifold X we will denote by C(X) (resp. C \u221e (X)) the\nspace of continuous (resp. infinitely smooth) functions on X. Assume now\nthat V is a Euclidean space. Let us describe the imbedding of V alkev (V ) into\nthe space of continuous functions C(Grk (V )) which we call Klain's imbedding. For any valuation \u03c6 \u2208 V alkev (V ) let us consider the function on Grk (V )\ngiven by L 7\u2192 \u03c6(DL ) where DL denotes the unit Euclidean ball inside L.\nThus we get a map V alkev (V ) \u2192 C(Grk (V )). The nontrivial fact due to D.\nKlain [15] (and heavily based on [14]) is that this map is injective.\nNow we would like to recall the Schneider imbedding of V alkodd (V ) into\nthe space of functions on a partial flag manifold. Let us denote by F\u0303 (V )\nthe manifold of pairs (\u03c9, M) where M \u2208 Grk+1(V ), and \u03c9 \u2208 M is a vector\nof unit length. Let us denote by C \u2212 (F\u0303 (V )) the space of continuous functions on F\u0303 (V ) which change their sign when one replaces \u03c9 by \u2212\u03c9. Let us\n3\n\n\fdescribe the imbedding of V alkodd (V ) into C \u2212 (F\u0303 (V )) (following [2]) which\nwe call Schneider's imbedding since its injectivity is an easy consequence of\na non-trivial result due to R. Schneider [23] about characterization of odd\ntranslation invariant continuous valuations. Fix a valuation \u03c6 \u2208 V alkodd (V ).\nFix any subspace M \u2208 Grk+1(V ). Consider the restriction of \u03c6 to M. By\na result of P. McMullen [19] any k-homogeneous translation invariant continuous valuation \u03c8 on (k + 1)-dimensional space M has the following form.\nThere exists a function f \u2208 C(S(M)) (here S(M) denotes the unit sphere in\nM) such that for any subset K \u2208 K(M)\nZ\n\u03c8(K) =\nf (\u03c9)dSk (K, \u03c9).\nS(M )\n\nMoreover the function f can be chosen to be orthogonal to any linear functional (with respect to the Haar measure on the sphere S(M)), and after this choice it is defined uniquely. We will always make such a choice\nof f . If the valuation \u03c8 is odd then the function f is also odd. Thus\napplying this construction to \u03c6|M for any M \u2208 Grk+1 (V ) we get a map\nodd\nV alk+1\n(V ) \u2192 C \u2212 (F\u0303 (V )) defined by \u03c6 7\u2192 f . This map turns out to be continuous and injective (see [2] Proposition 2.6, where the injectivity is heavily\nbased on [23]).\nLet us recall the definition of the Radon transform on the Grassmannians.\nThe orthogonal group acts transitively on Gri (V ), and there exists a unique\nO(n)-invariant probability measure (the Haar measure).\nThe Radon\nR transform Rj,i : Gri (V ) \u2192 Grj (V ) for j < i is defined by\n(R\nR j,i f )(H) = F \u2283H f (F )*dF . Similarly for j > i it is defined by (Rj,i f )(H) =\nf (F ) * dF . In both cases the integration is with respect to the invariant\nF \u2282H\nprobability measure on all subspaces containing (or contained in) the given\none. The Radon transform on real Grassmannians was studied in [7], [12].\nRecall now the definition of the cosine and sine of the angle between two\nsubspaces. Let E \u2208 Gri (V ), F \u2208 Grj (V ). Assume that i \u2264 j. Let us call\ncosine of the angle between E and F the following number:\n|cos(E, F )| :=\n\nvoli (P rF (A))\n,\nvoli (A)\n\nwhere A is any subset of E of non-zero volume, P rF denotes the orthogonal\nprojection onto F , and voli is the i-dimensional measure induced by the\nEuclidean metric. (Note that this definition does not depend on the choice\n4\n\n\fof a subset A \u2282 E). In the case i \u2265 j we define the cosine of the angle\nbetween them as cosine of the angle between their orthogonal complements:\n|cos(E, F )| := |cos(E \u22a5 , F \u22a5 )|.\n(It is easy to see that if i = j both definitions are equivalent.)\nLet us call sine of the angle between E and F the cosine between E and\nthe orthogonal complement of F :\n|sin(E, F )| := |cos(E, F \u22a5 )|.\nThe following properties are well known (and rather trivial):\n|cos(E, F )| = |cos(F, E)| = |cos(E \u22a5 , F \u22a5 )|,\n|sin(E, F )| = |sin(F, E)| = |sin(E \u22a5 , F \u22a5 )|,\n0 \u2264 |cos(E, F )|, |sin(E, F )| \u2264 1.\nFor any 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n \u2212 1 one defines the cosine transform\nTj,i : C(Gri (V )) \u2192 C(Grj (V ))\nas follows:\n(Tj,i f )(E) :=\n\nZ\n\n|cos(E, F )|f (F )dF,\n\nGri (V )\n\nwhere the integration is with respect to the Haar measure on the Grassmannian. The cosine transform was studied in [16], [17], [8], [9], [10], [6].\nLet us state some facts on the multiplicative structure on valuations. Let\nus briefly recall a construction of multiplication from [3], Section 1. A measure \u03bc on a linear space V is called polynomial if it is absolutely continuous\nwith respect to a Lebesgue measure, and the density is a polynomial. Let\n\u03bc and \u03bd be two polynomial measures on V (the case of Lebesgue measures\nwould be sufficient for the purposes of this article). Let A, B \u2208 K(V ). Consider the valuations \u03c6(K) = \u03bc(K + A), \u03c8(K) = \u03bd(K + B) where + denotes\nthe Minkowski sum of convex sets. Let \u2206 : V \u0592\u2192 V \u00d7 V denote the diagonal\nimbedding. Then the product of valuations is computed as follows:\n(\u03c6 * \u03c8)(K) = (\u03bc \u22a0 \u03bd)(\u2206(K) + (A \u00d7 B))\nwhere \u03bc \u22a0 \u03bd denotes the usual product measure. Product of linear combinations of measures of the above form is defined by distributivity. The product\n5\n\n\fturns out to be well defined and it is determined uniquely by the above expressions since the valuations of the above form are dense in the space of\npolynomial valuations with respect to some natural topology.\nWe will discuss now only the translation invariant case though in [3] the\nproduct was defined on a wider class of polynomial valuations. Actually in\nthis article we will need only the following result.\n1.3 Proposition. Let p1 : V \u2192 W1 and p2 : V \u2192 W2 be surjective linear maps. Let \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 be Lebesgue measures on W1 and W2 respectively.\nConsider on V the valuations \u03c6i (K) := \u03bci (pi (K)), i = 1, 2. Then\n(\u03c61 * \u03c62 )(K) = (\u03bc1 \u22a0 \u03bc2 )((p1 \u2295 p2 )(K))\nwhere p1 \u2295 p2 : V \u2192 W1 \u2295 W2 is given by (p1 \u2295 p2 )(v) = (p1 (v), p2(v)) and\n\u03bc1 \u22a0 \u03bc2 is the usual product measure on W1 \u2295 W2 .\nProof. First recall the following well known formula (which can be easily checked). Let I be a segment of unit length in the Euclidean space V\northogonal to a hyperplane H. Then one has\n\u2202\nvol(K + \u03bbI) = voln\u22121 (P rH K)\n\u2202\u03bb 0\nwhere P rH denotes the orthogonal projection onto H. Let now I1 , . . . , Ik be\npairwise orthogonal unit segments in V . Let L be the orthogonal complement\nto their span. Thus dim L = n\u2212k. By the inductive application of the above\nformula one obtains\nk\n\nX\n\u2202k\nvol\n(K\n+\n\u03bbj Ij ) = voln\u2212k (P rL K).\nn\n\u2202\u03bb1 . . . \u2202\u03bbk 0\nj=1\nLet us return to the situation of our proposition.

Let G be a Lie group. Let \u03c1 be a continuous representation of G in\na Fr\u00e9chet space F . A vector v \u2208 F is called G-smooth if the map G \u2212\u2192 F\ndefined by g 7\u2212\u2192 g(v) is infinitely differentiable. It is well known (and easy to\nprove) that smooth vectors form a linear G-invariant subspace which is dense\nin F . We will denote it by F sm . It is well known (see e.g. [25]) that F sm has\na natural structure of a Fr\u00e9chet space, and the representation of G in F sm\nis continuous with respect to this topology. Moreover (F sm )sm = F sm . In\nour situation the Fr\u00e9chet space is F = V al(V ) with the topology of uniform\nconvergence on compact subsets of K(V ), and G = GL(V ). The action of\nGL(V ) on V al(V ) is the natural one, namely for any g \u2208 GL(V ), \u03c6 \u2208 V al(V )\none has (g(\u03c6))(K) = \u03c6(g \u22121K).\n2.1 Theorem. Let 0 \u2264 i < n/2. Then the multiplication by (V1 )n\u22122i induces\nev\nan isomorphism V aliev (V )sm \u2192V\n \u0303 aln\u2212i\n(V )sm . In particular for p \u2264 n \u2212 2i the\nev\n(V ).\nmultiplication by (V1 )p is an injection from V aliev (V ) \u0592\u2192 V ali+p\n2.2 Remark. We would like to explain the use of the name \"hard Lefschetz theorem\". The classical hard Lefschetz theorem is as follows (see e.g.\n[11]). Let M be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold of complex dimension n with\nK\u00e4hler form \u03c9. Let [\u03c9] \u2208 H 2 (M, R) be the corresponding cohomology class.\nThen for 0 \u2264 i < n the multiplication by [\u03c9]2(n\u2212i) induces an isomorphism\nH i (M, R)\u2192H\n \u0303 2n\u2212i (M, R).\nFirst recall that in [3], Theorem 2.6, we have shown that (V1 )j is proportional to Vj with a non-zero constant of proportionality. Recall also the\n7\n\n=\n\n\fCauchy-Kubota formula (see e.g. [24]):\nZ\nVk (K) = c\nvolk (P rE K)dE.\nE\u2208Grk (V )\n\n2.3 Lemma. Let F \u2208 Gri (V ). Let \u03c6(K) = voli (P rF (K)). Then the image\nof Vk * \u03c6 in C(Grk+i ) under the Klain imbedding is given by the function\nZ\ng(L) = c\n|cos(L, R)|dR\nGrk+i (V )\u220bR\u2283F\n\nwhere dR is the (unique) O(i)\u00d7O(n\u2212i)-invariant probability measure on the\nGrassmannian of (k + i)-subspaces in V containing F , and c is a non-zero\nnormalizing constant.\nProof. Using the Cauchy-Kubota formula and Proposition 1.3 we have\nZ\n(Vk * \u03c6)(K) = c\nvolk+i ((P rF \u2295 P rE )(K))dE.\nE\u2208Grk (V )\n\nLet K = DL be the unit ball in a subspace L \u2208 Grk+i (V ). Then the image\nof Vk * \u03c6 in Grk+i (V ) under the Klain imbedding is\nZ\ng(L) = (Vk * \u03c6)(DL ) = c\nvolk+i ((P rE \u2295 P rF )(DL ))dE.\nE\u2208Grk (V )\n\n2.4 Claim.\nvolk+i ((P rE \u2295 P rF )(DL )) = \u03ba|cos(L, (E + F ))| * |sin(E, F )|\nwhere \u03ba is a non-zero constant.\nLet us postpone the proof of this claim and let us finish the proof of\nLemma 2.2. We get\nZ\n\u2032\n|cos(L, (E + F ))| * |sin(E, F )|dE.\ng(L) = c\nE\u2208Grk (V )\n\nFor a fixed subspace F \u2208 Gri (V ) let us denote by UF the open dense subset of\nGrk (V ) consisting of subspaces intersecting F trivially. Clearly the complement to UF has smaller dimension. We have the map T : UF \u2192 Grk (V /F )\ngiven by T (E) := (E + F )/F . Clearly T commutes with the action of\n8\n\n\fthe stabilizer of F in the orthogonal group O(n) (which is isomorphic to\nO(i) \u00d7 O(n \u2212 i)). Let m : Grk (V /F ) \u2192 Grk+i (V ) be the map sending a subspace in V /F to its preimage in V under the canonical projection V \u2192 V /F .\nThen in this notation we have\nZ\n\u2032\ng(L) = c\n|cos(L, (m \u25e6 T )(E)| * |sin(E, F )|dE.\nE\u2208UF\n\nLet us consider the following submanifold M \u2282 Grk (V /F )\u00d7Grk (V ) given\nby\nM = {(R, E)| E \u2282 m(R)}.\nThen UF is isomorphic to M via the map T1 : UF \u2192 M defined by T1 (E) =\n(T (E), E). Clearly T1 commutes with the natural action of the group O(i) \u00d7\nO(n \u2212 i) which is the stabilizer of F in O(n). We have also the projection\nt : M \u2192 Grk (V /F ) given by t(R, E) = R. Then\n\u0015\n\u0014Z\nZ\n\u2032\n|sin(E, F )|d\u03bcR(E)\ndR|cos(L, m(R))|\ng(L) = c\nR\u2208Grk (V /F )\n\nE\u2208Grk (t\u22121 (R))\n\nwhere \u03bcR is a measure on Grk (t\u22121 (R)). Note that the integral in square\nbrackets in the last expression is positive and does not depend on R since\nthe map TR = t \u25e6 T1 commutes with the action of O(i) \u00d7 O(n \u2212 i). Hence\ng(L) = c\u2032\u2032 R\u2208Grk (V /F ) |cos(L, m(R))|dR. Lemma 2.2 is proved. Q.E.D.\nProof of Claim 2.3. We may assume that E \u2229 F = 0. Set for brevity\np := P rE \u2295P rF . Then p factorizes as p = q \u25e6P rE+F where q : E +F \u2192 E \u2295F\nis the restriction of P rE \u2295 P rF to the subspace E + F . Then we have\nvolk+i ((P rE \u2295 P rF )(DL )) = volk+i (P rE+F (DL )) *\n\nvolk+i (q(DE+F ))\n=\nvolk+i (DE+F )\n\nvolk+i (q(DE+F ))\n.\nvolk+i (DE+F )\nLet us compute the last term in the above expression. Note that the dual\nmap q \u2217 : E \u2295 F \u2192 E + F is given by q \u2217 ((x, y)) = x + y. Clearly\nvolk+i (DL ) * |cos(L, (E + F ))| *\n\nvol(q \u2217 (DE\u2295F ))\n= |sin(E, F )|.\nvolDE\u2295F\nBut the left hand side in the last expression is equal to\nClaim 2.3 is proved. Q.E.D.\nWe will need one more lemma.\n9\n\nvol(q(DE+F ))\n.\nvol(DE+F )\n\nThus\n\n\f2.5 Lemma. Let \u03c6 \u2208 V aliev (V ) be a valuation given by\nZ\n\u03c6(K) =\nf (F )voli (P rF K)dF\nF \u2208Gri (V )\n\nwith f \u2208 C(Gri (V )). Then the image of Vk * \u03c6 in C(Gri+k (V ) under the\nKlain imbedding is given by\ng(L) = cTk+i,k+i \u25e6 Rk+i,i (f )\nwhere c is a non-zero normalizing constant.\nProof. By Lemma 2.2 one has\nZ\nZ\ng(L) = c\ndF f (F )\nF \u2208Gri (V )\n\nc\n\nZ\n\nR\u2208Grk+i (V )\n\ndR|cos(L, R)|\n\n|cos(L, R)|dR =\n\nGrk+i \u220bR\u2283F\n\nZ\n\nf (F )dF = cTk+i,k+i \u25e6 Rk+i,i (f ).\n\nF \u2208Gri (R)\n\nQ.E.D.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. Let us consider the Klain imbedding V allev (V )sm \u0592\u2192\nC \u221e (Grl (V )). In [6] it was shown that the image of V allev (V )sm is a closed subspace which coincides with the image of the cosine transform Tl,l : C \u221e (Grl (V )) \u2192\nC \u221e (Grl (V )). By Lemma 2.4, Vn\u22122i * Ti,i (f ) = Tn\u2212i,n\u2212i \u25e6 Rn\u2212i,i (f ). It was\nshown in [7] that Rn\u2212i,i : C \u221e (Gri (V )) \u2192 C \u221e (Grn\u2212i (V )) is an isomorphism. Hence the image under the Klain imbedding of Vn\u22122i * V aliev (V )sm\ncoincides with the image of Tn\u2212i,n\u2212i : C \u221e (Grn\u2212i ) \u2192 C \u221e (Grn\u2212i ) which is\nev\nequal to V aln\u2212i\n(V )sm . Hence the multiplication by V1n\u22122i : V aliev (V )sm \u2192\nev\nsm\nV aln\u2212i (V ) is onto. Let us check that the kernel is trivial. Indeed this operator commutes with the action of the orthogonal group O(n). The spaces\nev\nV aliev (V )sm and V aln\u2212i\n(V )sm are isomorphic as representations of O(n) (see\n[4], Theorem 1.2.2). Since every irreducible representation of O(n) enters\nwith finite multiplicity (in fact, at most 1) then any surjective map must be\ninjective. Q.E.D.\nNow let us discuss an application to valuations invariant under a group.\nLet G be a compact subgroup of the orthogonal group O(n). Let us denote by\nV alG (V ) the space of G-invariant translation invariant continuous valuations.\nAssume that G acts transitively on the unit sphere. Then it was shown in [1]\nthat V alG (V ) is finite dimensional. Also it was shown in [4] (see the proof\n10\n\n\fof Corollary 1.1.3) that V alG (V ) \u2282 V alsm (V ). We have also McMullen's\ndecomposition with respect to the degree of homogeneity:\nV alG (V ) = \u2295ni=0 V aliG (V )\nwhere V aliG (V ) denotes the subspace of i-homogeneous G-invariant valuations. Then it was shown in [3], Theorem 0.9 that V alG (V ) is a finite dimensional graded algebra (with grading given by the degree of homogeneity)\nsatisfying the Poincar\u00e9 duality (i.e. it is a so called Frobenius algebra). A\nversion of the hard Lefschetz theorem was given in [4]. Now we would like\nto state another version of it.\n2.6 Corollary. Let G be a compact subgroup of the orthogonal group O(n)\nacting transitively on the unit sphere. Assume that \u2212Id \u2208 G. Let 0 \u2264\ni < n/2 where n = dim V . Then the multiplication by (V1 )n\u22122i induces\nG\nan isomorphism V aliG (V )\u2192V\n \u0303 aln\u2212i\n(V ). In particular for p \u2264 n \u2212 2i the\np\nG\nmultiplication by (V1 ) induces an injection V aliG (V ) \u0592\u2192 V ali+p\n(V ).\nThis result follows immediately from Theorem 2.1.\n\n3\n\nThe case of odd valuations.\n\nIn this section we state the conjecture about an analogue of the hard Lefschetz\ntheorem for odd valuations and discuss it briefly.\nConjecture. Let 0 \u2264 i < n/2. Then the multiplication by (V1 )n\u22122i is\nodd\na map V aliodd (V )sm \u2192 V aln\u2212i\n(V )sm with trivial kernel and dense image. In\nparticular for p \u2264 n \u2212 2i the multiplication by (V1 )p is an injection from\nodd\nV aliodd (V )sm \u0592\u2192 V ali+p\n(V )sm .\nLet us show that it is enough to prove only either injectivity or density of\nthe image of the multiplication by (V1 )n\u22122i . This is a particular case of the\nfollowing slightly more general statement.\nodd\n3.1 Proposition. Let L : V aliodd (V )sm \u2192 V aln\u2212i\n(V )sm be a continuous\nlinear operator commuting with the action of the orthogonal group O(n).\nThen it has a dense image if and only if its kernel is trivial.\nodd\nProof. Note that the spaces V aliodd (V )sm and (V aln\u2212i\n(V )\u2217 )sm \u2297 V aln (V )\nare isomorphic as representation of the full linear group GL(V ) by the Poincar\u00e9\nduality proved in [3]. Let us replace all spaces by their Harish-Chandra\n\n11\n\n\fmodules. All irreducible representations of O(n) are selfdual. Hence the\nodd\nsubspaces of O(n)-finite vectors in V aliodd (V )sm and V aln\u2212i\n(V )sm are isomorphic as O(n)-modules. Moreover each irreducible representation of O(n)\nenters into these subspaces with finite multiplicity (since by [2] both spaces\nare realized as subquotients in so called degenerate principal series representations of GL(V ), namely representations induced from a character of a\nparabolic subgroup). Then it is clear that the operator L between the spaces\nof O(n)-finite vectors commuting with the action of O(n) is surjective if and\nonly if it is injective. Q.E.D.\n\n4\n\nHard Lefschetz theorem for even valuations\nfrom [4].\n\nIn this short section we remind another form of the hard Lefschetz theorem\nfor even valuations as it was proven in [4]. Note that it also was heavily based\non the properties of the Radon and cosine transforms on Grassmannians.\nLet us fix on V a Euclidean metric, and let D denote the unit Euclidean\nball with respect to this metric. Let us define on the space of translation\ninvariant continuous valuations an operation \u039b of mixing with the Euclidean\nball D, namely\nd\n(\u039b\u03c6)(K) :=\n\u03c6(K + \u03b5D)\nd\u03b5 \u03b5=0\nfor any convex compact set K. Note that \u03c6(K + \u03b5D) is a polynomial in \u03b5 \u2265 0\nby McMullen's theorem [18]. It is easy to see that the operator \u039b preserves\nparity and decreases the degree of homogeneity by one. In particular we have\nev\n\u039b : V alkev \u2192 V alk\u22121\n(V ).\n\nThe following result is Theorem 1.1.1 in [4].\nev\n4.1 Theorem. Let n \u2265 k > n/2. Then \u039b2k\u2212n : (V alkev )sm \u2192 (V aln\u2212k\n(V ))sm\nev\nis an isomorphism. In particular \u039bi : V alkev \u2192 V alk\u2212i\n(V ) is injective for\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n \u2212 k.\n\nReferences\n[1] Alesker, Semyon; On P.
