We use Floer cohomology to prove the monotone version of a conjecture of Audin: the minimal Maslov number of a\nmonotone Lagrangian torus in R2n is 2. Our approach is based\non the study of the quantum cup product on Floer cohomology\nand in particular the behaviour of Oh's spectral sequence with respect to this product. As further applications we prove existence\nof holomorphic disks with boundaries on Lagrangians as well as\nnew results on Lagrangian intersections.\n\n1. Introduction and main results\nLet (M, \u03c9) be a tame symplectic manifold (see [A-L-P], also Section 5). The class of tame symplectic manifolds includes compact\nmanifolds, Stein manifolds, and more generally, manifolds which are\nsymplectically convex at infinity, as well as products of all the above.\nLet L \u2282 (M, \u03c9) be a closed Lagrangian submanifold. Throughout\nthe paper, by a closed manifold we mean compact manifold without\nboundary, and all Lagrangian manifolds are supposed to be compact\nand without boundary. One of fundamental problems in symplectic\ntopology is to find restrictions on the topology of L, in particular on\nthe Maslov class \u03bcL : \u03c02 (M, L) \u2192 Z. See Section 5 for the definition,\nand for other basic notions from symplectic topology. Below we will\nbe concerned with monotone Lagrangian submanifolds. For such a Lagrangian L \u2282 (M, \u03c9) denote by NL \u2208 Z+ the minimal Maslov number,\ni.e. the generator of the image of \u03bcL .\nOur first result deals with Lagrangian submanifolds of R2n . Here we\nendow R2n with its standard symplectic structure \u03c9std = dx1 \u2227 dy1 +\ndx2 \u2227 dy2 + ... + dxn \u2227 dyn , where (x1 , y1 , x2 , y2, ..., xn , yn ) are standard\ncoordinates on R2n .\nThis is part of my PhD thesis, being carried out under the guidance of Prof.\nP. Biran, at Tel-Aviv University.\nThe author was partially supported by the ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\n(grant No. 1227/06 *).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLEV BUHOVSKY\n\nTheorem 1. Given a monotone Lagrangian embedding of the n-torus\nL = Tn \u0592\u2192 (R2n , \u03c9std ), its minimal Maslov number must be NL = 2.\nLet us remark, that the minimal Maslov of such an embedding must\nbe even, due to the orientability of the torus, and it is a non-negative\ninteger. The possibility of NL = 0 cannot occur, since then, by monotonicity of L, the area class of L must vanish, and this contradicts the\nfamous result of Gromov [Gr], that in our case guarantees the existence\nof a pseudo-holomorphic disc with a boundary on L, which must have\na positive symplectic area.\nTheorem 2. Let L = Tn \u0592\u2192 (R2n , \u03c9std ) be a monotone Lagrangian\nembedding of the n-torus and let J be an arbitrary almost complex\nstructure on R2n , compatible with \u03c9std . Then for every point p \u2208 L\nthere exists a J-holomorphic disc u : (D, \u2202D) \u2192 (M, L) whose boundary passes through p, i.e. p \u2208 u(\u2202D), and whose Maslov index \u03bcL ([u])\nis 2.\nTheorem 1 is a partial solution to a question of Audin [A], which\nstates the same thing without the monotonicity assumption. Previous\nresults in this direction were obtained by Biran and Cieliebak, Li, Oh,\nPolterovich, Viterbo [B-Ci, Li, Oh-2, A-L-P, P, V-1, V-2].\nOur approach is based on Floer cohomology, in particular on the\nquantum product on Floer cohomology. We will study the multiplicative behaviour of the spectral sequence due to Oh, whose first page (i.e\nterm E1 ) is related to the singular cohomology of a Lagrangian, and\nwhich converges to its Floer cohomology.\nThe idea of the proof of Theorem 1 is based on an idea originally\nraised by Seidel. The proof of Theorem 2 uses ideas from [B-Co-2,\nCL]. The statement of Theorem 2 can be more directly proved (using\nGromov compactness theorem, but without any Floer theory) in the\ncase of a Clifford torus and of an exotic torus due to Chekanov (see [Ch,\nE-P]), hence for every Lagrangian torus which is Hamiltonianly isotopic\nto each one of them. However, the full classification of monotone tori\nin R2n is still not known.\nIn this paper we use Floer cohomology with coefficients in a ring\nA = Z2 [T \u22121 , T ], and grade A by deg T = NL (see [B-Co-3, Oh-1]). We\nshow\nTheorem 3. Let L = RPn \u0592\u2192 M be a monotone Lagrangian embedding of the real projective space into a tame symplectic manifold\nM. Assume in addition that its minimal Maslov number is NL > 3.\nThen HF \u2217(L, L) \u223c\n= (H(L; Z2 ) \u2297 A)\u2217 . In particular L is not Hamiltonianly displaceable. Moreover, for every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism\n\n\fTHE MONOTONE AUDIN CONJECTURE\n\n3\n\nf : M \u2192 M, for which f (L) intersects L transversally, we have \u266f(L \u2229\nf (L)) > n + 1.\nAfter the first version of this paper was written, we received from\nFukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono revised version of their work [FOOO] in\nwhich results, similar to Theorem 1, were obtained.\nSection 2 is devoted for the proofs of Theorems 1, 2, 3. In Section 3\nwe recall the definitions of Floer cohomology and the spectral sequence\nof Oh, and give the definition of the quantum product on the Floer\ncomplex. Then, in the end of Section 3, we state Theorems 4, 5. Theorem 4 guarantees the multiplicativity of the Floer cohomology and of\nthe spectral sequence of Oh. The statement of Theorem 5 is used in\nan essential way in the proofs of Theorems 1, 2, 3. Section 4 stands\nfor the proofs of Theorems 4, 5. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to recall\nthe basic notions from symplectic topology, that we use in the present\narticle.\n2. Proof of main results\nIn this section we provide proofs for Theorems 1, 2, 3. The tools that\nwe use in the proofs are the multiplicativity of the spectral sequence\nof Oh, and special properties of this spectral sequence. For detailed\ndescription of the Floer cohomology, the spectral sequence of Oh, and\nthe proof of existence of the multiplicative structure, we refer the reader\nto Section 3.\nDenote by {Erp,q , dr } the spectral sequence of Oh, with coefficients\nin the ring A = Z2 [T \u22121 , T ], where A is graded by deg T = NL . The\nproperties of it, that are essential for the proofs of Theorems 1, 2, 3,\nare (see Section 3) :\n\u2022 E1p,q = H p+q\u2212pNL (L, Z2 ) \u2297 ApNL , d1 = [\u22021 ] \u2297 T , where [\u22021 ] :\nH p+q\u2212pNL (L, Z2 ) \u2192 H p+1+q\u2212(p+1)NL (L, Z2 ) is induced from \u22021 the operator, that enters in the definition of the Floer differential (see Section 3). The multiplication on H \u2217 (L, Z2 ), induced\nfrom the multiplication on E1p,q , coincides with the standard\ncup product.\n\u2022 More generally, for every r \u2265 1, Erp,q has the form Erp,q = Vrp,q \u2297\nApNL with dr = \u03b4r \u2297 T r , where Vrp,q are vector spaces over Z2\nand \u03b4r are homomorphisms \u03b4r : Vrp,q \u2192 Vrp+r,q\u2212r+1 defined for\nevery p, q and satisfy \u03b4r \u25e6 \u03b4r = 0. We have\np,q\n=\nVr+1\n\nker(\u03b4r : Vrp,q \u2192 Vrp+r,q\u2212r+1)\n.\nimage (\u03b4r : Vrp\u2212r,q+r\u22121 \u2192 Vrp,q )\n\n\f4\n\nLEV BUHOVSKY\n\n\u2022 {Erp,q , dr } converges to HF , i.e\np\np+q\n(L, L)\np,q \u223c F HF\n,\nE\u221e\n= p+1\np+q\nF HF (L, L)\n\nwhere F p HF (L, L) is the filtration on HF (L, L), induced from\nthe filtration F p CF (L, L).\nProof of Theorem 1. Consider a Lagrangian embedding L = Tn \u0592\u2192\n(R2n , \u03c9std ), and assume by contradiction that NL > 3. The Floer\ncohomology HF (L, L) is well-defined, and the spectral sequence of Oh,\nwhich computes it, becomes multiplicative. Look at the first stage E1\nof the spectral sequence. We know that V1p,q = H p+q\u2212pNL (L; Z2 ), and\nthe induced product on V1 is the classical cup-product and we have a\ndifferential \u03b41 : V1 \u2192 V1 , which decreases the natural grading V1 by\nNL \u2212 1. The key observation now is that the entire cohomology ring\nH \u2217 (L, Z2 ) is generated by the first cohomology H 1 (L, Z2 ) since L = Tn\n. Therefore looking on the natural grading on the V1 , the elements\nof degree 1 generate the whole V1 . Now, because of \u03b41 decreases the\ngrading by NL \u22121 > 2, then for every a \u2208 V1 of degree 1 we have \u03b41 (a) =\n0. Then, since \u03b41 satisfies the Leibnitz rule, the kernel Ker(\u03b41 ) \u2286 V1\nis a sub-ring, therefore Ker(\u03b41 ) = V1 , so we obtain \u03b41 \u2261 0. Therefore\nV2 = H(V1 , \u03b41 ) = V1 , therefore V2 is isomorphic to V1 as a graded ring.\nTherefore we can apply the same argument for \u03b42 : V2 \u2192 V2 , since \u03b42\ndecreases the grading by 2NL \u2212 1 > 2, so we will get that \u03b42 \u2261 0, and\nso on, so at each stage we will get that \u03b4r \u2261 0 by induction, therefore\nd1 = d2 = . . . = 0, so as a conclusion we get that E1 = E2 = . . . =\nE\u221e = HF (L, L). But L is clearly Hamiltonianly displaceable in R2n ,\nhence HF (L, L) = 0 and we obtain that E1 = 0. Contradiction.\n\u0003\nRemark. The same arguments from the proof of Theorem 1 in fact\nprove the following more general result:\nLet L \u2282 (M, \u03c9) be a monotone Lagrangian with NL \u2265 2. Assume\nthat:\n(1) (M, \u03c9) is a subcritical Stein manifold. (See e.g. [B] for the\ndefinition).\n(2) H \u2217 (L; Z2 ) is generated by H 1 (L; Z2 ).\nThen NL = 2.\nProof of Theorem 2. First let us show this statement for generic J and\nthen we will use a compactness argument for proving it for every J,\ncompatible with \u03c9std . Let us make a generic choice of J and a Morse\nfunction f : L \u2192 L, such that the point x \u2208 L is the only point of\nmaximum of f , i.e the only point with index equal to n ( it is easy to\n\n\fTHE MONOTONE AUDIN CONJECTURE\n\n5\n\nshow that such an f exists ). Then the Floer cohomology HF (L, L) is\nwell-defined. By Theorem 1 we have that NL = 2. Look at the spectral\nsequence of Oh, which converges to HF (L, L). Let us show that the\ndifferential \u03b41 : V1 \u2192 V1 is non-zero. The argument is similar to the\none from Theorem 1. Indeed, if conversely, we have that \u03b41 \u2261 0, then\nV2 = H(V1, \u03b41 ) = V1 as graded rings and \u03b42 : V2 \u2192 V2 is a differential\nwhich decreases the grading by 2NL \u2212 1 = 3 and V2 = V1 is as a\nring generated by it's elements of degree 1, therefore \u03b42 = 0, so V3 =\nH(V2, \u03b42 ) = V2 = V1 as graded rings and so on. Therefore we will obtain\na contradiction as in proof of Theorem 1 with the fact that HF (L, L) =\n0. So we have proved that \u03b41 : V1 \u2192 V1 is non-zero, therefore the map\n[\u22021 ] : H \u2217 (L, Z2 ) \u2192 H \u2217\u22121 (L, Z2 ) is non-zero. Let us show that this\nimplies that [\u22021 ]([p]) 6= 0, where [p] \u2208 H n (L, Z2 ) is a generator. From\nthe theorems above we have that [\u22021 ] : H \u2217 (L, Z2 ) \u2192 H \u2217\u22121 (L, Z2 ) is\na differential and satisfies a Leibnitz rule. Therefore, since H 1 (L, Z2 )\ngenerates the whole H \u2217 (L, Z2 ), [\u22021 ] restricted to H 1 (L, Z2 ) is non-zero.\nTake some x1 \u2208 H 1 (L, Z2 ) such that [\u22021 ](x1 ) 6= 0, then because of\n[\u22021 ](x1 ) \u2208 H 0 (L, Z2 ) \u223c\n= Z2 we have that [\u22021 ](x1 ) = 1 \u2208 H \u2217 (L, Z2 ).\nComplete x1 to a basis x1 , x2 , . . . , xn of H 1 (L, Z2 ) as a vector space\nover Z2 . Then it is easy to see that the product x1 x2 . . . xn = [p] \u2208\nH n (L, Z2 ). Denote y = x2 x3 . . . xn , then x1 ([\u22021 ]([p])) = x1 ([\u22021 ](x1 y)) =\nx1 (([\u22021 ](x1 ))y + x1 ([\u22021 ](y))) = x1 y + x21 ([\u22021 ](y)) = x1 y = [p] 6= 0, hence\n[\u22021 ]([p]) 6= 0. Now if we go back to the definition of [\u22021 ], we see that\nthe moduli-space M1 (p, q) is non-empty for some critical point q of f\nwith indf (q) = n \u2212 1. Now, because of p is a critical point to the top\nindex, the only gradient trajectories which start with x are constant\ntrajectories, therefore the boundary of the J-holomorphic disc from the\ndefinition of M1 (p, q) contains the point p.\nWe have proved the theorem for generic choice of J. For the general\nJ, consider a sequence of generic Jn which converge to J. Then for\neach Jn we have a Jn -holomorphic disc un : (D, \u2202D) \u2192 (R2n , L) such\nthat p \u2208 un (\u2202D). By Gromov compactness theorem ( see [Gr] ) there\nis a subsequence of un which converges to a tree of discs with sphere\nbubblings, which are J-holomorphic, however because of \u03bc(un ) = NL =\n2 is minimal, in the limit we have only one disc and no bubblings of\nspheres occur, therefore we obtain a J -holomorphic disc which contains\np.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3. The idea is similar to the the one in the proof of\nTheorem 1. Namely, as before we see that the Floer cohomology of\nL is well defined, and we can compute it via the spectral sequence of\n\n\f6\n\nLEV BUHOVSKY\n\nOh, which is multiplicative. Look at the first stage E1 of the spectral\nsequence. We have that H 1 (L, Z2 ) generates the entire cohomology\nH \u2217 (L, Z2 ), hence V1 is generated as a ring by it's elements of degree 1\nand the differential \u03b4 : V1 \u2192 V1 decreases the grading by NL \u2212 1 > 2.\nThen arguing as in the proof of Theorem 1, we conclude that E1 = E2 =\n. . . = E\u221e = HF (L, L) = H \u2217 (L; Z2 ). Therefore HF (L, L) 6= 0 , hence\nL is not displaceable. Moreover for every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism\nf : M \u2192 M, for which f (L) intersects L transversally, we have \u266f(L \u2229\nf (L)) = dimZ2 CF (L; f (L)) > dimZ2 H \u2217(L; Z2 ) = n + 1.\n\u0003\n\n3. Floer cohomology, the spectral sequence, and the\nquantum product\n3.1. Floer cohomology and the spectral sequence of Oh. We\nrecall some basic facts of Floer theory, which will be stated without\nproofs (for the proofs we refer the reader to [B-Co-1, B-Co-2, Oh-2]).\nLet (M, \u03c9) be a tame symplectic manifold and let L \u2282 (M, \u03c9) be a\nmonotone Lagrangian submanifold with minimal Maslov number NL \u2265\n2. Then one can define the Floer cohomology of the pair (L, L), which\nwe will denote by HF (L, L). As mentioned before, we will work here\nwith coefficients in the ring A = Z2 [T, T \u22121 ], as described in [B-Co-3].\nIn fact, we will work with an equivalent definition of HF (L, L) as\ndescribed in [B-Co-3, Oh-3], which uses holomorpic disks rather than\nholomorphic strips. We briefly recall the construction now.\n\ny\n\nx\n\nFigure 1.\nWe choose a generic pair of a Morse function f : L \u2192 R and a Riemannian metric on L and consider a generic almost complex structure\non M. Denote by Cf\u2217 the Morse complex associated to f , graded by\nMorse indeces of f . Let A = Z2 [T, T \u22121 ] be the algebra of Laurent polynomials\nL over iZ2 , where iwe take deg T = NL . Take the decomposition\nA =\ni\u2208Z A , where A is the subspace of homogenous elements of\ndegree i.\n\n\fTHE MONOTONE AUDIN CONJECTURE\n\n7\n\nWe define the Floer complex as CF (L, L) = Cf \u2297 A, which has a\nnatural grading coming from grading on Cf , A.

To define the Floer differential dF : CF (L, L) \u2192\nCF (L, L), \u0002we introduce\nauxiliary operators \u22020 , \u22021 , . . . , \u2202\u03bd : Cf \u2192 Cf ,\n\u0003\ndim L+1\nwhere \u03bd =\n.\nNL\nFor every pair of critical points x, y \u2208 Cf denote by Mk (x, y) the\nmoduli-space of diagrams as in Figure 1. This diagram consists of pieces\nof gradient trajectories of \u2212f , joined by somewhere injective(see [L])\npseudo-holomorphic discs u1 , u2, . . . , ul in M, with boundaries on L,\nsuch that the first piece of gradient trajectory converges to x, and the\nlast piece converges to y, when time is reversed and such that sum of\nMaslov indices of the discs is \u03bc(u1 ) + \u03bc(u2) + . . . + \u03bc(ul) = kNL . Let us\ngive a precise definition of an element of Mk (x, y). Consider a collection of somewhere injective pseudo-holomorphic discs uj : (D 2 , \u2202D 2 ) \u2192\n(M, L), j = 1, 2, . . . , l, with boundaries on L, and a collection of trajectories\n\u03b30 : (\u2212\u221e, a0 ] \u2192 L, \u03b31 : [a0 , a1 ] \u2192 L, \u03b32 : [a1 , a2 ] \u2192 L, . . . ,\n\u03b3l : [al\u22121 , al ] \u2192 L, \u03b3l+1 : [al , +\u221e) \u2192 L,\nwhere \u2212\u221e < a0 < a1 < . . . < al < +\u221e.

If the dimension is 0, Mk (x, y) is a manifold of\ndimension 0 and is compact, so it is a finite collection of points. Denote\nin this case nk (x, y) := \u266fMk (x, y)( mod 2). Then define\nX\n\u2202k (x) =\nnk (x, y)y.\ny\u2208Cf ,ind(y)\u2212ind(x)+kNL \u22121=0\n\nNote that \u22020 is the usual Morse-cohomology boundary operator. We\nsee that dF is not compatible with grading, since each \u2202i acts like\n\u2202i : Cf\u2217 \u2192 Cf\u2217+1\u2212iNL (L).\nLet Floer differential dF : CF \u2217 (L, L) \u2192 CF \u2217+1 (L, L) by definition\nequals to dF = \u22020 \u2297 1 + \u22021 \u2297 T + . . . + \u2202\u03bd \u2297 T \u03bd . Then one can show\nthat dF is indeed a differential. It is well known that the homology\nof the complex (CF (L, L), dF ) is canonically isomorphic to the Floer\ncohomology of the pair (L, L) (see [B-Co-1, B-Co-2] and the references\ntherein). Therefore we will write\nHF \u2217 (L, L) = H \u2217 (CF (L, L), dF ).\nConsider now the following decreasing filtration on CF (L, L):\nX\nF p CF (L, L) = {\nxi \u2297 T ni | xi \u2208 Cf , ni > p}.\nIt is obviously compatible with dF (due to the monotonicity of L),\nso by a standard algebraic argument we obtain the spectral sequence\n{Erp,q , dr }.

On V1 this grading coincides with the natural\ngrading on the cohomology ring H \u2217 (L, Z2 ).\n\n3.2. Quantum product on Floer cohomology. Consider generic\nMorse functions f, g, h : L \u2192 R and denote by\n(CFf , dfF ), (CFg , dgF ), (CFh , dhF )\nthe corresponding Floer complexes. Then we will be able to define a\n\"quantum product\" \u22c6 : CFf \u2297 CFg \u2192 CFh , such that differentials will\nsatisfy the following analog of the Leibnitz rule:\ndhF (a \u22c6 b) = dfF (a) \u22c6 b + a \u22c6 dgF (b).\nMoreover, this product is compatible with the filtrations on the CF 's\n\u2032\n\u2032\nin the sense that \u2217 maps F p CFf \u2297 F p CFg to F p+p CFh .\nx\n\u2212 grad f\n\u2212 grad h\nz\n\n\u2212 grad g\ny\n\nFigure 2.\nThen automatically the spectral sequences become multiplicative,\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ni.e we have products Erp,q (f ) \u2297 Erp ,q (g) \u2192 Erp+p ,q+q (h) at each stage\nof the spectral sequence, which are induced from \u22c6, such that the\ndifferential dr satisfies the Leibnitz rule, according to this product,\nand such that the product at the r + 1 stage comes from the product at r stage.

Then\nthe crucial observation will be that on V1 the induced product coincides with the usual cup-product on H \u2217 (L; Z2 ), so the next products on the Vr are induced from this cup product, therefore the quantum effects are lost for r > 1. Now let us describe the operation\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u22c6 : F p CFf \u2297 F p CFg \u2192 F p+p CFh . To do this, let us introduce operations ml : Cf \u2297 Cg \u2192 Ch (for a more general introduction of such an\noperations see [BC, FOOO]). The operation m0 is the usual product\non the Morse complexes of f, g, h. Let us recall its definition. For every triple of generators x \u2208 Cf , y \u2208 Cg , z \u2208 Ch , denote by M0 (x, y; z)\nthe moduli-space of diagrams as in Figure 2. This diagram is given by\ntrajectories \u03b3f : [0, +\u221e) \u2192 L, \u03b3g : [0, +\u221e) \u2192 L, \u03b3h : (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u2192 L,\nsuch that\n\u03b3 \u0307f (t) = \u2212\u2207f (\u03b3f (t)),\n\n\u03b3 \u0307g (t) = \u2212\u2207g(\u03b3g (t)),\n\n\u03b3 \u0307h (t) = \u2212\u2207h(\u03b3h (t)),\n\nand\nlim \u03b3f (t) = x,\n\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nlim \u03b3g (t) = y,\n\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nlim \u03b3h (t) = z,\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b3f (0) = \u03b3g (0) = \u03b3h (0).\nThen by our assumption that f, g, h is a generic triple of Morse functions, we get that M0 (x, y; z) is a manifold, and its dimension is given\nby indz h\u2212indx f \u2212indy g. Moreover, when indz h\u2212indx f \u2212indy g = 0,\nM0 (x, y; z) is a zero-dimensional compact manifold, hence it consists\nof a finite number of points. For the case of indz h \u2212 indx f \u2212 indy g = 0\nwe set n0 (x, y; z) := \u266fM0 (x, y; z)( mod 2). Now we define\nX\nm0 (x, y) :=\nn0 (x, y; z)z.\nz\u2208Ch ,indz h\u2212indx f \u2212indy g=0\n\nThis is the classical cup product Cfi \u2297 Cgj \u2192 Chi+j , and so the classical\nMorse differential satisfies the Leibnitz rule and induces the classical\ncup-product on cohomology H \u2217 (L; Z2 ). The further operations ml for\nl > 1 will use quantum contributions.\nBefore defining the general ml , let us first describe m1 . For a triple of\ncritical points x \u2208 Cf , y \u2208 Cg , z \u2208 Ch , we define the space M1 (x, y; z)\nto be the moduli-space of diagrams as in Figure 3, where \"black lines\"\nare gradient trajectories of f, g, h respectively and the \"discs\" are pseudoholomorphic somewhere injective discs with boundaries on L and Maslov\nindices equal to NL .

The product on V1 , induced from \u22c6, coincides with the\nclassical cup-product on H \u2217 (L; Z2 ).\n4. Existence and properties of the quantum product proofs\nProof of Theorem 4. The main idea of the proof is similar to the analogous statement in classical Morse theory, for a standard Morse differential and a product on the Morse complex. In what follows we have\nfl (x, y; z).\nto find a compactification of the manifolds Ml (x, y; z) and M\nWe are mostly interested in the components of the boundary of codimension 1. A point of the compactification of Ml (x, y; z) is a diagram,\nconsisting of several pseudo-holomorphic discs with boundaries on L,\nspheres, critical points of f, g, h and pieces of gradient trajectories of\nf, g, h between them. Let us describe what can happen when we pass\nto the limit of a sequence of elements of Ml (x, y; z). First, some of the\ngradient trajectories of f, g or h can \"brake\" and new critical points\nof f, g, h can appear in the diagram. Second, some of the pieces of\nthe gradient trajectories can \"shrink\" to a point, such that we will obtain two touching discs or one disc containing a critical point. Also\nlooking on Ml (x, y; z), the piece of gradient trajectory containing the\n\"middle point\" can shrink to a point, so we will get a disc containing\nthis \"middle point\". It can also happen that some of the discs split\nto a tree of discs and also some of the discs can bubble a sphere. The\nlast thing that can happen is that for some pieces of trajectories which\nhave endpoints on a disc, their endpoints on that disc converge one to\nanother and become a single point. All these degenerations can happen simultaneously. However, when one looks on the codimension-1\npart of the boundary of Ml (x, y; z), only one of this degenerations can\nhappen, moreover when we have the case of breaking of some trajectory, it can brake only at one point and this can happen only for one\ntrajectory. Also, when we have \"shrinking\" of some trajectory, only\none trajectory can shrink to a point. Thirdly, when we have splitting\nof a disc to discs, then only one disc can split and only to two discs,\nand bubbling of spheres always has co-dimension > 2. Finally, when\nendpoints of some trajectories, lying on the boundary of some disc, become one point, we always have codimension > 2, except for the case\nfl (x, y; z), and two of the trajectories which end on the\nwhen it is in M\nboundary of the \"middle disc\" in the limit have the same end on this\nboundary.\nTherefore, when we are looking only at the codimension 1 part of\nMl (x, y; z), only the following cases can happen:\n\n\fTHE MONOTONE AUDIN CONJECTURE\n\n15\n\nx\nt\nz\ny\n\nFigure 6.\n\nx\nz\n\ny\n\nFigure 7.\nFor Ml (x, y; z) we can obtain:\na) One trajectory \"brakes\" and we obtain a situation as in Figure 6,\nwhen a new critical point t appears ( this can happen with gradient\ntrajectories of f, g, h).\nb) Two neighboring discs in the chain become \"touching\" and the\ntrajectory which joins them collapses into a point, as in Figure 7.\nc) The last disc from the chain of discs of g, for example, comes\ncloser and closer to the \"middle point\", where gradient trajectories\nof f, g, h meet, until the trajectory which connects it to this \"middle\npoint\" collapses to a point ( as in Figure 8 ).\nd) One of the discs splits to the union of two touching discs (Figure 9).\n\nx\nz\ny\n\nFigure 8.\n\n\f16\n\nLEV BUHOVSKY\n\nx\n\nx\nz\n\ny\n\nz\n\ny\n\nx\nz\n\ny\n\nFigure 9.\nDenote by\nMal (x, y; z), Mbl(x, y; z), Mcl (x, y; z), Mdl(x, y; z)\nthe manifolds of diagrams of types a, b, c, d respectively.\nfl (x, y; z),\nNow addressing to the co-dimension 1 compactification of M\nwe see that the following cases are possible:\ne) One trajectory \"brakes\" and we obtain a situation as in Figure 10.\nf ) Two neighboring discs in the chain come close and the trajectory\nwhich joins them collapses to a point, or the middle disc comes close\nto some neighboring disc as in Figure 11.\ng) One of the discs splits to a union of two touching discs (and we\nagain obtain a situation as in Figure 11).\nh) Two trajectories touching the middle disc converge to trajectories which touch the middle disc in the same point. We obtain again\nFigure 8.\n\nx\nt\nz\ny\n\nFigure 10.\n\n\fTHE MONOTONE AUDIN CONJECTURE\n\n17\n\nx\n\nx\n\nz\n\nz\n\ny\n\ny\n\nFigure 11.\nAs before, we denote by\nMel (x, y; z), Mfl (x, y; z), Mgl (x, y; z), Mhl (x, y; z)\nthe manifolds of the situations e, f, g, h respectively. Note that\n\uf8f1\nc\nh\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2Ml (x, y; z) = Ml (x, y; z)\n(\u2217) Mbl (x, y; z) = Mdl (x, y; z)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3Mf (x, y; z) = Mg (x, y; z)\nl\nl\n\nNow let us see how this can be applied to prove the Leibnitz rule. Let\nus first write what it means. Taking x \u2208 Cf , y \u2208 Cg , we have\nX\nX\n\u2202j (mi (x, y)) \u2297 T j+i .\ndhF (x \u22c6 y) = dhF (\nmi (x, y) \u2297 T i ) =\ni>0\n\ni,j>0\n\nSimilarly,\ndfF (x) \u22c6 y =\n\nX\n\nmi (\u2202j x, y) \u2297 T j+i\n\nX\n\nmi (x, \u2202j y) \u2297 T j+i .\n\nj,i>0\n\nand\nx \u22c6 dgF (y) =\n\nj,i>0\n\nTherefore, we are left with proving that for every l,\nX\nX\nX\nmi (\u2202j x, y) +\n\u2202j (mi (x, y)) =\ni,j>0,i+j=l\n\ni,j>0,i+j=l\n\nmi (x, \u2202j y).\n\ni,j>0,i+j=l\n\nThis means that we have to show that for every choice of generators\nx \u2208 Cf , y \u2208 Cg , z \u2208 Ch with ind(z) = ind(x)+ind(y)+lNL +1, the total\nnumber of configurations in Mal (x, y; z) \u222a Mel (x, y; z) is even. For this\nconsider the space Ml (x, y; z). It is a 1-dimensional manifold, therefore\nits boundary consists of an even number of points. On the other hand,\nfrom a gluing argument (see [FO, FOOO, MS, S]) it follows that this\nboundary is the union of\n\n\f18\n\nLEV BUHOVSKY\n\nMal (x, y; z), Mbl(x, y; z), Mcl (x, y; z), Mdl(x, y; z),\nMel (x, y; z), Mfl (x, y; z), Mgl (x, y; z), Mhl (x, y; z)\n(because in our case dim Ml (x, y; z) = 1, so in a generic situation\nthe part of the boundary of Ml (x, y; z) of co-dimension bigger than\n1 must be of dimension less than 0, so it is an empty set). Now, (\u2217)\nshows that modulo 2, the total number of points on the boundary of\nMl (x, y; z) is equal to \u266fMal (x, y; z) + \u266fMfl (x, y; z) and is even. This\nproves Theorem 4.\n\u0003\nRemark. In several places we have applied the dimension formula\ndim M(A, J) = n+\u03bc(A), where M(A, J) is a manifold of J-holomorphic\nmaps u : (D 2 , \u2202D 2 ) \u2192 (M, L) with [u] = A \u2208 \u03c02 (M, L), in order to\nshow that certain configurations of gradient trajectories and pseudoholomorphic discs cannot appear for generic choice of J ( because of\nnegative dimension ). However, this dimension formula is based on the\ntransversality argument ( see [MS] ) which requires somewhere injectivity of the J-holomorphic discs. To solve this problem we use work\nof Kwon, Oh and of Lazzarini ( see [K-O, L] ). More precisely, suppose we have such a configuration and some pseudo-holomorphic disc\nu : (D, \u2202D) \u2192 (M, L) participated in it is not somewhere injective.\nThen we can decompose it to a union of almost everywhere injective\ndiscs u1 , u2, . . . , uk with multiplicities m1 , m2 , . . . , mk respectively, such\nthat there exists mj > 1 ( see [K-O, L] for the precise details of this\ndecomposition ). This decomposition preserves the relative homology\nclass, namely\n[u] = m1 [u1 ] + m2 [u2 ] + . . . + mk [uk ] \u2208 H2 (M, L),\nhowever, when we look on this configuration when we take all the discs\nuj with multiplicity 1, then it's total area and hence a total Maslov\nclass is strictly smaller than of the original configuration, therefore by a\nusual dimension count we obtain that such a configuration has negative\ndimension and hence cannot appear in a generic situation, therefore\nthe original configuration also cannot appear. See [B-Co-1] for more\ndetails on such arguments.\nProof of Theorem 5. First look at the induced product on the level E0 .\nLet us show that it coincides with the classical product on the Morse\ncomplex. From the standard construction of the spectral sequence we\nhave that\np,q\nE p,q (f ) = F p CF p+q /F p+1 CF p+q \u223c\n= V (f ) \u2297 ApNL ,\n0\n\n\u2032 \u2032\nE0p ,q (g)\n\nf\n\np\u2032\n\np\u2032 +q \u2032\n\n= F CFg\n\nf\n\n/F\n\np\u2032 +1\n\np\u2032 +q \u2032\n\nCFg\n\n0\n\n\u2032\np\u2032 ,q \u2032\n\u223c\n= V0 (g) \u2297 Ap NL ,\n\n\fTHE MONOTONE AUDIN CONJECTURE\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n19\n\nwhere V0p,q (f ) = Cfp+q\u2212pNL , V0p ,q (g) = Cgp +q \u2212p NL . Now take \u03b1 \u2208\n\u2032 \u2032\nV0p,q (f ), \u03b2 \u2208 V0p ,q (g). Now, we can take \u03b1 := \u03b1 \u2297 T p \u2208 F p CFfp+q ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b2 := \u03b2 \u2297 T p \u2208 F p CFgp +q as a pre-images of \u03b1 \u2297 T p \u2208 E0p,q (f ),\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b2 \u2297 T p \u2208 E0p ,q (g) under natural projections F p CFfp+q \u2192 E0p,q (f ),\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nF p CFgp +q \u2192 E0p ,q (g) respectively. Then, by definition of the product\n\u22c6,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b1 \u22c6 \u03b2 = m0 (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2297 T p+p + m1 (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2297 T p+p +1 +\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n+m2 (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2297 T p+p +2 + . . . \u2208 F p+p CFhq+q ,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nand so the induced product of \u03b1 \u2297 T p \u2208 E0p,q (f ), \u03b2 \u2297 T p \u2208 E0p ,q (g) is\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe image of \u03b1 \u22c6 \u03b2 \u2208 Chp+p +q+q \u2212pNL \u2212p NL under the natural projection\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nF p+p CFhp+p +q+q \u2192 E0p+p ,q+q (h), which is m0 (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2297 T p+p . There\u2032 \u2032\nfore the induced product of \u03b1 \u2208 V0p,q (f ), \u03b2 \u2208 V0p ,q (g) is m0 (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208\n\u2032\n\u2032\nV0p+p ,q+q (h), which is the classical product in the Morse complex. Note\nalso that the differential \u03b40 : V0p,q \u2192 V0p,q+1 coincides with classical\nMorse differential, therefore the induced product on V1 = H(V0 , \u03b40 ) is\nthe classical cup-product.\n\u0003\n\u2032\n\n5. Basic notions of symplectic topology in terms of\nLagrangian Floer theory.\nIn this section we summarize some relevant notions from symplectic\ntopology used in the article.\n5.1. Tame symplectic manifold. A symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) is\ncalled tame if there exists an almost complex structure J, such that\nthe bilinear form g\u03c9,J (*, *) = \u03c9(*, J*) is a Riemmanian metric on M, and\nmoreover the Riemmanian manifold (M, g\u03c9,J ) is geometrically bounded\n(i.e. its sectional curvature is bounded above and the injectivity radius\nis bounded below). See [A-L-P, Gr] for more details and the relevance\nof this condition for the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves.\n5.2. The Maslov class. The Maslov class is a homomorphism \u03bcL :\n\u03c02 (M, L) \u2192 Z, associated to a Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 (M, \u03c9)\n. To describe it, we start with the linear case. Consider the space\nR2n \u223c\n= Cn with standard symplectic structure. Denote by L(n) the set\nof all Lagrangian linear subspaces of R2n . The unitary group U(n) acts\ntransitively on L(n) such that a stabilizer of Lagrangian subspace Rn =\n{y1 = . . . = yn = 0} \u2282 Cn is the orthogonal group O(n) \u2282 U(n). So\nL(n) is homeomorphic to the quotient U(n)/O(n). On U(n)/O(n) we\nhave well-defined map det2 : U(n)/O(n) \u2192 S 1 \u2282 C, hence we obtain a\n\n\f20\n\nLEV BUHOVSKY\n\nmap L(n) \u2192 S 1 . The corresponding homomorphism \u03bc : \u03c01 (L(n)) \u2192 Z\nis called the Maslov index. It can be verified that it is an isomorphism.\nNow, consider a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) and a Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 M. Take a disc in M with boundary lying on L:\nu : (D, \u2202D) \u2192 (M, L). We obtain the following diagram of vector\nbundles:\nu\u2217 T (M) \u2283 u\u2217 T (L)\n\u2193\n\u2193\nD\n\u2202D\nOver each point on the disc D we have a symplectic linear space and for\nevery point on the boundary \u2202D we have a Lagrangian linear subspace\nof the corresponding linear symplectic space. Now, we can symplectically trivialize the bundle u\u2217 T (M) \u2192 D, and as a result we will get a\nloop of Lagrangians in R2n , \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 L(n). Applying to this loop the\nMaslov index, we get the Maslov class evaluated on D, namely, we define \u03bcL (D) = \u03bc(\u03b3). It can be shown that this definition does not depend\non the trivialization, and actually depends only on [D] \u2208 \u03c02 (M, L).\nGiven a Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 (M, \u03c9) we denote by NL the positive generator of the image \u03bcL (\u03c02 (M, L)) \u2282 Z. We shall refer to NL\nas the minimal Maslov number of L.\n5.3. Symplectic area class. This is a homomorphism \u03c9 : \u03c02 (M, L) \u2192\nR which computes the symplectic area of a disc: if we have a representative\nR \u03b1 = [\u03c6 : (D, \u2202D) \u2192 (M, L)] \u2208 \u03c02 (M, L) , we define\n\u03c9(\u03b1) := D (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c9). Also here it can be shown that the symplectic area\nclass \u03c9(\u03b1) depends only on \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c02 (M, L).\n5.4. Monotone symplectic manifolds. Let (M, \u03c9) be a symplectic\nmanifold. Denote by c1 \u2208 H 2 (M; R) the first Chern class of the tangent\nbundle T (M) viewed as a complex vector bundle (where the complex\nstructure on T (M) is taken to be any almost complex structure tamed\nby \u03c9). We say that (M, \u03c9) is a monotone symplectic manifold if there\nexists a positive real number \u03bb > 0 such that [\u03c9] = \u03bbc1 . Given\na Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 (M, \u03c9), we have two homomorphisms:\n\u03bcL : \u03c02 (M, L) \u2192 Z, and \u03c9 : \u03c02 (M, L) \u2192 R. We say that L is monotone,\nif these two homomorphisms \u03bcL , \u03c9 are proportional by some positive\nconstant, that is, there exists a constant \u03bb \u2208 R, \u03bb > 0 , such that for\nevery \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c02 (M, L) we have \u03bcL (\u03b1) = \u03bb\u03c9(\u03b1).\nAcknowledgments.
