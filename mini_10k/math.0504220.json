That is to say the integration can be carried out by first\nintegrating over each conjugacy class and then integrating over the set of conjugacy classes.\nThen for a general Lie group, how to reduce the integration of functions over it ?\nIn Helgason[2], the author presents some integral formulas related to the Cartan, Iwasawa\nand Bruhat decompositions for semisimple Lie groups. In this paper, we will use the Weyl\n1\n\n\fintegration model, which is first introduced by An and Wang in [3] and can be used to\ngeneralize the reducing integration idea to integrations over G-spaces, to obtain an integral\nformula for KAK decomposition of reductive Lie groups. It is worthy of indicating that this\nreducible idea of integrations can be effectively used to calculate the eigenvalue distribution\nof random matrices in random matrix ensemble theory. But here we do not plan to study\nthose applications in random matrix theory.\nLet G be a Lie group, X a G-space, Y a imbedding submanifold of X and \u03c3 the Gaction on X. Suppose that dx, dy and d\u03bc are proper invariant measures over X, Y and\nG/K respectively. The Weyl integration model (see section 2 for its details) is a system\n\u0001\nG, \u03c3, (X, dx), (Y, dy), (G/K, d\u03bc) satisfying some proper conditions (see (7)-(9)). Indeed,\nfor a Weyl integration model, the following formula holds for all f \u2208 L1 (X, dx),\nZ\nZ \u0010Z\n\u0011\n1\nf (x)dx =\nf (\u03c3(g, y)) d\u03bc([g]) J(y) dy,\nd Y\nX\nG/K\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J \u2208 C \u221e (Y ) and d is the multiplicity of the model. That is to say that the integration\nover a G-space X can be converted to the integration by first integrating over each orbit\nand then integrating over the orbits space Y . Moreover, under some orthogonal conditions,\nJ(y) can be effectively calculated, i.e. there is a constant C such that\nJ(y) = C det \u03a8y ,\n\nfor all y \u2208 Y \u2032 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a8y is a mapping induced by G-action \u03c3 (see (11)).\n\u0010\nIn this paper, we will construct a Weyl integration model K\u00d7K, \u03c3, (G, dg), (A, da), (K\u00d7\n\u000e\n\u0001\u0011\nK) M, d\u03bc . The meanings of its members are as follow. G is a reductive Lie group with\nLie algebra g. Let \u03b8 be the Cartan involution on g. g = k \u2295 p is the Cartan decomposition of\n\ng, where k and p are the +1 and \u22121 eigenspaces of \u03b8 respectively. Let K be the associated\nmaximal compact subgroup of G with Lie algebra k.\nLet a be a maximal abelian subspace of p. Set A = exp(a), then A is a closed subgroup\nof G. It is known that G = KAK in the sense that every element in G has a decomposition\nas k1 ak2 with k1 , k2 \u2208 K and a \u2208 A.\nTo consider the following group K \u00d7 K-action\n\u0001\n(k1 , k2 ), a \u2192\n7 k1 ak2\u22121 .\n\n(3)\n\n\b\nM = (k1 , k2 ) \u2208 K \u00d7 K k1 ak2\u22121 = a, \u2200 a \u2208 A .\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c3 : (K \u00d7 K) \u00d7 A \u2192 G,\nLet\n\n2\n\n\fThen the K \u00d7 K-action \u03c3 can be naturally reduced to a map \u03c6, i.e.\n\u000e\n\u0001\n\u03c6 : (K \u00d7 K) M \u00d7 A \u2192 G,\n[(k1 , k2 )], a 7\u2192 k1 ak2\u22121 .\n\n(5)\n\nLet dg, da be the Haar measures on G and A respectively. There has a K \u00d7 K\u000e\ninvariant\nmeasure\nd\u03bc\non\n(K\n\u00d7\nK)\nM since \u0011\nK \u00d7 K is compact. Then we can prove that\n\u0010\n\u000e\n\u0001\nK \u00d7 K, \u03c3, (G, dg), (A, da), (K \u00d7 K) M, d\u03bc is a Weyl integration model with finite multiplicities. Thus by (1), we obtain an integral formula (see theorem 2.6 for details) which\n\u000e\nreduces the integration over reductive Lie group G to one first over (K \u00d7 K) M and then\nover its subgroup A. Moreover, by (2), we can calculate that the according J(y) has the\nfollowing formula\nJ(a) = C\n\nY\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u03a3+\n\n\u0001\nsinh \u03bb(H)\n\n\u03b2\u03bb\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere a = eH , H \u2208 a, \u03b2\u03bb is the dimension of the restricted root space g\u03bb with respect to the\nrestricted root \u03bb in the positive restricted root system \u03a3+ and C is a proper constant. By\ncomparison, it is formally analogous to the integration formula for Cartan decomposition of\nnoncompact semisimple Lie groups (see [2]).\nThe structure of the paper is as follow. In section 2, we briefly introduce the Weyl\nintegration model and the Restricted root system and KAK decomposition for a reductive\nLie group. The main results of the paper are presented at the end of this section. In section\n3, we prove the main results.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries and Main Results\n\n2.1\n\nWeyl integration model\n\nIn this subsection, we briefly introduce the Weyl integration model. One may refer to\n[3] for details.\nLet G be a Lie group which acts on a n-dimensional smooth manifold X. The action is\ndenoted by \u03c3 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X. Let dx be a G-invariant admissible measure on X. Y is an\nimbedding submanifold of X. Suppose that there is an admissible measure dy on Y , and\nX0 \u2282 X, Y0 \u2282 Y are closed zero measure subsets of X and Y respectively. Set X \u2032 = X \\ X0 ,\n\b\n\b\nY \u2032 = Y \\ Y0 and K = g \u2208 G \u03c3(g, y) = y, \u2200 y \u2208 Y . Let Kx = g \u2208 G \u03c3(g, x) = x be the\n\b\nisotropic subgroup associated with x \u2208 X and Oy = \u03c3(g, y) g \u2208 G the orbit of y \u2208 Y .\n\nThen K \u2282 Ky , \u2200 y \u2208 Y . In the following text we suppose that\n[\nX\u2032 =\nOy .\ny\u2208Y \u2032\n\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\f\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 ,\n\nTy X = Ty Oy \u2295 Ty Y,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich is called the transversal condition.\ndimKy = dimK,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe G-action \u03c3 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X can be reduced to a map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2192 X by \u03c6([g], y) =\n\u03c3(g, y) and furthermore to a map which is still denoted by \u03c6, i.e. \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 by\nrestriction. By the above assumption, \u03c6 is surjective. Suppose that there is a G-invariant\nadmissible measure d\u03bc on G/K.\nProposition 2.1. Suppose the conditions (7), (8) and (9) hold, then \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032\nis a local diffeomorphism.\nLet G, X, Y, K, \u03c3, \u03c6, dx, dy, d\u03bc be the above objects. A Weyl integration model is a system\n\u0001\nG, \u03c3, (X, dx), (Y, dy), (G/K, d\u03bc) , in which we can choose X0 such that the map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7\n\nY \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 is a finite-sheeted covering map. The number of sheets of the covering map is\n\ncalled the multiplicity of the model. About a Weyl integration model, we have the following\nbasic theorem.\n\u0001\nTheorem 2.2. If G, \u03c3, (X, dx), (Y, dy), (G/K, d\u03bc) is a Weyl integration model with multiplicity d, then the formula (1) holds for all f \u2208 C \u221e (X) with f \u2265 0 or f \u2208 L1 (X, dx).\n\nLet s be a linear subspace of the Lie algebra g of G, such that g = k \u2295 s, where k is the\nLie algebra of K. Then s can be identified with the tangent space T[e] (G/K) of G/K at\npoint [e] in a natural way:\nT[e] (G/K) \u223c\n= s.\nBy the transversal condition (8), the tangent map d\u03c6 : T[e] (G/K) \u2295 Ty Y \u2192 Ty X of \u03c6 at\npoint ([e], y) (y \u2208 Y \u2032 ) can be regarded as a linear transformation\nd\u03c6 : s \u2295 Ty Y \u2192 Ty Oy \u2295 Ty Y.\nIt can be proved that (see [3])\nd\u03c6 =\n\n\u03a8y\n\n0\n\n0\n\nid\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03a8y : s \u2192 Ty Oy is given by\n\u03a8y (\u03be) =\n\nd\ndt\n\nt=0\n\n\u03c3(exp t\u03be, y),\n\n4\n\n\u2200 \u03be \u2208 s.\n\n(11)\n\n\fSuppose that there is a Riemannian structure on X such that the following orthogonal\ncondition holds\nfor all y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\nTy Y \u22a5 Ty Oy ,\n\n(12)\n\nLet dx and dy are the Riemannian measures on X and Y respectively. Then there is a\nconstant C such that\nJ(y) = C det \u03a8y ,\n\n2.2\n\nfor all y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\n(13)\n\nRestricted root system and KAK decomposition for reductive\nLie group\n\nIn the sense of Knapp ([1], Sec.7.2), a reductive Lie group is a 4-tuple (G, K, \u03b8, B)\nconsisting of a Lie group G, a compact subgroup K of G, a Lie algebra involution \u03b8 of\nthe Lie algebra g of G and a nondegenerate Ad(G)-invariant \u03b8-invariant bilinear form B\non g such that (i) g is a reductive Lie algebra, (ii) the decomposition of g into +1 and \u22121\neigenspaces under \u03b8 is g = k \u2295 p, where k is the Lie algebra of K, (iii) k and p are orthogonal\nunder B and B is positive definite on p and negative definite on k, (iv) multiplication, as a\nmap from K \u00d7 exp(p) into G, is a diffeomorphism onto, and (v) every automorphism Ad(g)\nof gC is inner for g \u2208 G, i.e., is given by some x \u2208 Int(gC ). K is called the associated\nmaximal compact subgroup, \u03b8 the Cartan involution and B the invariant bilinear form. The\ndecomposition of g (according G) in property (iii) (according (iv)) is called (global) Cartan\ndecomposition.\nNow let G is a reductive Lie group with Lie algebra g. Let a be a maximal abelian\n[\n\b\nsubspaces of p, then p =\nAd(k)a. Set g\u03bb = X \u2208 g (adH)X = \u03bb(H)X, for all H \u2208 a .\nk\u2208K\n\nA nonzero \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217 is called a restricted root of g if g\u03bb is nonzero. Accordingly g\u03bb is called a\n\nrestricted root space. The set of restricted roots is denoted by \u03a3 and Let \u03a3+ be the set of\npositive restricted roots.\nReflections in the restricted roots generate the Weyl group W (\u03a3) of \u03a3. Denoted by\nNK (a) and ZK (a) the normalizer and centralizer of a in K respectively, then the Weyl\n\u000e\ngroup W = NK (a) ZK (a) and the Lie algebras of NK (a) and ZK (a) are m = Zk (a).\nThe restricted root space g\u03bb satisfies the following basic properties\n\nProposition 2.3.

We come to consider the G-action \u03c3 defined by (3) and its reduced map\n\u03c6 defined by (5). Let A\u2032 be the set of regular elements in A and G\u2032 = KA\u2032 K.
