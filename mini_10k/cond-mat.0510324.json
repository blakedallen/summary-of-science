The fluctuation is\ncalled normal if \u03b3 = 1 and anomalous if \u03b3 > 1. In\nthe latter case, it implies the system is unstable, since\nthe isothermal compressibility \u03baT \u2192 \u221e in the thermodynamic limit (see Eq. (1) below). For example, for a\nnon-interacting uniform Bose system below the critical\ntemperature, the fluctuation of the number of condensate particles h\u03b4 N\u030202 i \u221d N 2 , and that of the number of\n2\ni \u221d N 4/3 in the grand\nnon-condensate particles h\u03b4 N\u0302nc\n2\n2\ni \u221d N 4/3 in the\ncanonical ensemble, while h\u03b4 N\u03020 i = h\u03b4 N\u0302nc\ncanonical ensemble [1]; all are anomalous since \u03b3 > 1.\nHowever, for a trapped ideal Bose gas, the fluctuation\nof the number particles is normal, since the confinement\neffectively suppresses the thermal fluctuation [2].\nRecently the number-of-particle fluctuation of interacting Bose-condensed systems has attracted much theoretical attention, but whether or not it is anomalous still\nhas not been resolved, since different methods predict\ndifferent values of \u03b3 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Particularly, even for the Bogoliubov approximation, both\n\u03b3 = 4/3 [3, 5, 7, 8, 11] and \u03b3 = 1 [9, 12] scaling laws\nhave been obtained.\nIn order to see how these controversies arise, it is useful to examine the bases of these model calculations.\nRefs. [4, 6] use an energy functional of the total number of particles N , the number of thermal excited particles Nex , and the single-particle spectrum \u03b5~k . Using this\nenergy functional, the fluctuations of the number of condensate and non-condensate particles can be calculated\nusing the partition function in either the grand canonical ensemble, canonical ensemble, or microcanonical ensemble, and a \u03b3 = 1 scaling law was obtained for both\nthe condensate and non-condensate number-of-particles\n\nfluctuations. One important observation, which is essential to obtain the \u03b3 = 1 scaling law in this approach,\nis that phonon excitations have been excluded from the\nsingle-particle spectrum. The \u03b3 = 1 scaling law for the\ncondensate fluctuation is also obtained in Ref. [10], in\nwhich a single-condensate-mode Hamiltonian is used. In\nRefs. [3, 7, 8, 11], the spectrum obtained by the Bogoliubov approximation was used and a \u03b3 = 4/3 scaling law\nwas obtained for the non-condensate number-of-particle\nfluctuation. However using the compressibility sum rule\n(see Eq. (2)), a \u03b3 = 1 scaling law was obtained in Refs.\n[9, 12] for the total number-of-particle fluctuation in the\nsame Bogoliubov approximation. From this brief literature survey, it is understood that the number-of-particle\nfluctuation in an interacting Bose-condensate system is\nhighly model dependent, since the definition of the condensate fraction, the number of non-condensate particles,\nand the energy spectrum are highly model dependent.\nBut the contradictory results in Refs. [3, 7, 8, 11] with\nthat in Refs. [9, 12] within the same Bogoliubov approximation deserve further investigation.\nAs can be shown, the total number-of-particle fluctuations of any equilibrium system can be calculated from\nthe static thermodynamic relation\nhN\u0302 2 i \u2212 hN\u0302 i2\nkB T \u2202N\nh\u03b4 N\u0302 2 i\n=\n=\nN\nN\nN \u2202\u03bc\n\n= \u03c1kB T \u03baT , (1)\nT\u03a9\n\nwhere N\u0302 is the particle number operator with expectation\nvalue N , kB T is the temperature, \u03bc is chemical potential, \u03a9 is the volume of the system, and \u03c1 = N/\u03a9 is the\nnumber density. On the other hand, the total numberof-particle fluctuation can be also determined by the following dynamic compressibility sum rule\nh\u03b4 N\u0302 2 i\nkB T\n=\u2212\nlim \u03c7nn (~q; \u03c9 = 0),\nN\n\u03c1 q~\u21920\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c7nn (~q; \u03c9) is the density response function. The\nnumber-of-particle fluctuations calculated from these two\n\n\f2\nrelations must be consistent in any approximation. However, we have seen that the static result \u03b3 = 4/3 obtained\nin Refs. [3, 7, 8, 10] is not consistent with the dynamic\nresult \u03b3 = 1 obtained in Ref. [9, 12]. This leads to a contradictory conclusion about the stability of the system\nsince, as argued by Yukalov [12], an anomalous fluctuation of the number of non-condensate particles would\ninevitably lead the system to be unstable while an interacting Bose-condensed system is stable.\nWe have seen that the above inconsistency of the statics with the dynamics in the Bogoliubov approximation is related to the separation of the condensate and\nnon-condensate components when the broken Bose U (1)\ngauge symmetry is used. In this case, the Bose field operator \u03c8\u0302 is split as\n\u03c8\u0302(~r) = \u03a8(~r) + \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302(~r),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a8(~r) 6= 0 is the Bogoliubov order parameter, and\n\u03b4 \u03c8\u0302(~r), usually called the non-condensate field operator,\nrepresents both the dynamic excitation and thermal depletion out of the condensate. This subtlety in \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302 shows\nthat the condensate and non-condensate components are\nstrongly correlated, and the condensate component can\nnot be treated just as a static reservoir. Instead, the dynamics aspect of \u03a8 must be taken into account in calculation of the number of condensate and non-condensate\nparticles for the purpose of calculating the number-ofparticle fluctuation from Eq. (1). To resolve the inconsistency of statics with dynamics and to treat \u03a8 as a\ndynamic quantity, it is crucial to identify the equilibrium\nstate with which the density response function \u03c7nn is\ndetermined. Using this equilibrium state as a reference,\nthe number of condensation particles N0 , the number\nof dynamically excited particles Nnc , and the number\nof thermally depleting particle \u00d1 can be unambiguously\ndefined.\nWe will also show that the anomalous fluctuation of\nthe number of non-condensate particles is an intrinsic feature of the broken U (1) gauge symmetry. It is well known\nthat a direct consequence of the above broken U (1) gauge\nsymmetry is that the poles of the single-particle Green\nfunction defined with \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302 and the total density response\nfunction are identical. Therefore, the fluctuation of the\nnumber of non-condensate particles inevitably follows the\nN 4/3 anomalous law, since the momentum distribution\nof this non-condensate particle always has a 1/k 2 singularity in the long-wavelength limit, regardless of at\nwhat level the interacting Bose Hamiltonian is truncated.\nHowever, we shall show that this anomalous fluctuation\ndoes not imply the instability of the interacting Bose system. This is because, as we shall show, the condensate\nand non-condensate components can not be treated as\nlinearly independent terms so that an anomalous fluctuation of the number of non-condensate particles does not\nnecessarily indicate that the system is unstable.\nOne way to avoid such an anomalous fluctuation of the\nnumber of non-condensate particles is to work with an ensemble in which the gauge symmetry is not broken [13],\n\nso that we can avoid the entangling of particle-conserving\ncollective excitations and single-particle excited state in\nthe pole of the non-condensate single-particle Green function. Indeed, using the random phase approximation\nwith inclusion of exchange (RPAE) developed by Minguzzi and Tosi [14], which keeps the U (1) gauge symmetry, we are able to show that while the total numberof-particle fluctuation is normal and consistently determined from statics and dynamics, the anomalous fluctuation of the number of non-condensate particles is completely absent.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly\nsummarize the rules to build the non-condensate singleparticle Green function and the density response function with the broken U (1) gauge symmetry. In Sec. III,\nwe examine how the consistency between Eqs. (1) and\n(2) can be obtained in calculating the number-of-particle\nfluctuation, and interpret the physical meaning of the\nanomalous fluctuation of the number of non-condensate\nparticles in the Bogoliubov approximation. In Sec. IV,\nwe carry out a calculation in the random phase approximation with inclusion exchange and in the dielectric formalism to support our interpretations presented in Sec.\nIII. The discussions and conclusion are presented in the\nlast section.\n\nII. SINGLE-PARTICLE GREEN FUNCTION\nAND DENSITY RESPONSE FUNCTION WITH\nBROKEN U (1) GAUGE SYMMETRY\n\nIn this section, we briefly summarize the rules to construct the single-particle Green function and density response function with broken U (1) gauge symmetry.

The total number of particles is\n\nkB T \u2202Nnc\nN\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n\u03bc=g\u03c10\n\nkB T \u2202Nnc\n=\nN\n\u2202\u2206\n\n\u2206=0\n\n=\n\u03bc=g\u03c10\n\nkB T \u2202N0\nN \u2202\u2206\n\n=\n\u2206=0\n\nkB T\n.\nmc2B\n\nwhere Nnc is calculated as\nNnc = \u2212\n\ni\nXh\n1 X BA ~\n(u~2k + v~k2 )n~k + v~k2 .\nG11 (k; i\u03c9n ) =\n\u03b2\nn,~\nk\n\n~\nk6=0\n\n(25)\nDirect calculation shows that\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\nby keeping the terms that have non-zero expectation values in a subclass of states built from Gross-Pitaevskii\nground state. If we adopt this identification:\n(i) The number-of-particle fluctuation from statics is\ngiven by Eq. (27), which is now completely consistent\nwith Eq. (23). Both are normal, and therefore the system\nis proved to be stable, as it should be.\n(ii) Nnc is the number of particles excited out of the\ncondensate due to its oscillation, i.e. it is the depletion\nof the Gross-Pitaevskii equilibrium state [19]. N0 in Eq.\n(24) should be replaced by N0\u2032 ,\nN0\u2032 = N0 \u2212 Nnc ,\n\n(28)\n\nthe number of particles remaining in the condensate after\nNnc particles are dynamically excited out of the condensate. The single-particle Green function G\u03b1\u03b2 describes\nthe dynamic process of the oscillation of the condensate.\nWith the broken U(1) gauge symmetry, the oscillation of\nthe condensate is interpreted as ejecting particles, which\nbecome the non-condensate particles. This interpretation of the single-particle Green's function gives a reasonable explanation of the density response function given\nby Eq. (22). It also explains the physical meaning of the\nresult given by Eq. (26). We argue that, the Nnc dynamically excited particles form a non-interacting system with\nchemical potential given by \u2206 = 0. Equation (26) then\nrepresents the number-of-particle fluctuation of this noninteracting system. In order to see this, we calculate the\ndensity response function of this non-interacting system\n[17]\n\ni\n1 X h BA ~\n~ q ; i\u03c9m + i\u03c9n ) + GBA (~k; i\u03c9m )GBA (~k + ~q; i\u03c9m + i\u03c9n ) .\nG++ (k; i\u03c9m )GBA\n++ (k + ~\n\u2212+\n\u2212+\n\u03a9\u03b2\nm~\nk6=0\n\n(24)\n\n~\nk6=0\n\nThe number-of-particle fluctuation is the sum of Eqs.\n(26) and (27), which is clearly not consistent with Eq.\n(23). This is the inconsistency of the result in Refs.\n[3, 7, 8, 11] with that in Refs. [9, 12]. We should remind ourselves that Eq. (1) is a thermodynamic relation\nfor an equilibrium system which is described by a set of\nequations of state. Also, according to finite-temperature\nlinear-response theory, the density response function is\ncalculated from an equilibrium state. Of course the equilibrium states that are used in Eqs. (1) and (2) should be\nthe same. So what is the equilibrium state for the Bogoliubov approximation at finite temperature? To find the\nanswer, we notice that Eq. (27) is identical to Eq. (23)\nand we get it from relation \u03bc = g\u03c10 . Therefore, the equilibrium state in the Bogoliubov approximation is identified to be a state that all particles occupy in the ~k = 0\nlevel and its equation of state is given by \u03bc = g\u03c10 = g\u03c1.\nThis identification is sound since the relation \u03bc = g\u03c10 is\nexactly the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nfor a uniform system without thermal depletion particles. Indeed, as proved by Leggett [19], the Bogoliubov\nHamiltonian can be obtained from the Hamiltonian (4)\n\n\u03c7BA\nq ; i\u03c9n ) = \u2212\nnn,nc (~\n\nN = N0 + Nnc ,\n\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n1\n1 X\n2\n2 2\n2 2 kB T\nn~k +\n(u~k + v~k ) n~k (n~k + 1) + 4u~k v~k\n,\n=\nN\n\u03c9~k\n2\n\nThe anomalous N 4/3 behavior of this equation can be\nseen, since in the long-wavelength limit, u~2k \u223c v~k2 \u223c k1 ,\nand n~k \u223c k1 , so the integrand has a k14 singularity.\nOn the other hand, using the chemical potential \u03bc =\ng\u03c10 , one gets\nkB T \u2202N0\nN \u2202\u03bc\n\ngiven\n\n(29)\n\n\f5\nA similar result with Eq. (29) is obtained by Meier and Zwerger [5] by calculating the phase fluctuation of the order\nparameter \u03a8(~r) of Eq. (3). It is important to point out the difference of the physical meanings between Eqs. (22) and\n(29). According to Eq. (2), the number-of-particle fluctuation of the non-interacting system is\n\u001b\n\u0015\n\u001a\u0014\n\u00112\n2\n\u0001\nh\u03b4 N\u0302nc\ni\nkB T\n1 X \u0010 2\n2 2\nBA\n2 2\n2\n(30)\n=\u2212\nlim \u03c7\n(~\nq ; 0) =\nu~k + v~k + 4u~k v~k n~k n~k + 1 + u~k v~k ,\nN\n\u03c1 q~\u21920 nn,nc\nN\n~\nk6=0\n\np\nwhere n~k = (e\u03b2\u03c9~k \u2212 1)\u22121 . Here \u03c9~k = \u03b5~k (\u03b5~k + 2g\u03c10 )\nis the Bogoliubov mode. This is exactly the same as\nEq. (7) in Ref. [3] obtained by Giorgini et. al. for the\n2\nfluctuation of non-condensate particles h\u03b4Nnc\ni/N . We\nnotice that the leading order terms of this result is identical to those of Eq. (26) in ~k \u223c 0 region, where the\nanomalous behavior arises, since k\u03c9B~T \u2248 n~k . Therefore,\nk\nfor this non-interacting system, the number-of-particle\nfluctuations obtained from statics and dynamics are also\nconsistent, even though they are anomalous. However,\nthis anomalous fluctuation is not an implication of instability of the interacting Bose gas, since we have proved\nfrom both statics and dynamics that the total number-ofparticle fluctuation is normal. This can also be seen by\nsubstituting Eq. (24) into Eq. (1) but replacing N0 with\nN0\u2032 ; the anomalous fluctuation due to Nnc is completely\ncanceled out. This calculation clearly shows the importance of the dynamic aspect of the condensate reservoir.\n\n(iii) There is a new consistency. The chemical potential\nas a functional of the total number of particles N and the\nequilibrium number of particles N0 in condensate can be\ndetermined both dynamically from the Hugenholtz-Pines\ntheorem (17) and statically from the equilibrium equation of state. These two must be consistent with each\nother. However, there is a deeper physical meaning of\nthis consistency. The equilibrium state described by the\nequation of state has a definite number of particles (here\nis N0 ). Therefore, this new consistency shows that the\nHugenholtz-Pines theorem is to restore the conservation\nof the number of particles. Indeed, it is well known that\nthe Hugenhotz-Pines theorem is required by the continuity equation [20, 21].\n\nIn the next section, we shall show that these interpretations about the number-of-particle fluctuation, N0\u2032 ,\nNnc , and the single-particle Green function G\u03b1\u03b2 , as well\nas the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem in the Bogoliubov approximation remain valid at the level of approximation\nin which all the terms in Eq. (5) are kept. As examples,\nwe consider the random-phase approximation with inclusion of exchange (RPAE) developed by Minguzzi and\nTosi [14] and the dielectric formalism by Fliesser et. al.\n[22]. We shall not give the detailed derivations, since\nthey are available in the literature. The steps presented\nhere highlight the physics at hand.\n\nIV. RANDOM-PHASE APPROXIMATION AND\nDIELECTRIC APPROACH WITH INCLUSION\nEXCHANGE\n\nIn the RPAE, the equilibrium equations of state of the\nBose-condensed system are the time-independent finitetemperature Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate and static Hartree-Fock equation for the thermal\ndepletion particles. For a homogenous system, they are\n\u03bc = g\u03c10 + 2g \u03c1\u0303,\n\n(31)\n\nhHF \u03c8~k (~r) = \u03b5~HF\n\u03c8~k (~r), ~k =\n6 0,\nk\n\n(32)\n\nwhere\n\u22072\n+ 2g\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bc,\n2m\n= \u03b5~k + 2g\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bc,\n\nhHF = \u2212\n\n(33)\n\n\u03b5~HF\nk\n\n(34)\n\nare the static Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian and singleparticle energy with respect to the chemical potential\nfor the thermal depletion particles. Here \u03c10 = N0 /\u03a9,\n\u03c1\u0303 = \u00d1 /\u03a9, and \u03c1 = N/\u03a9 are the equilibrium condensate,\nthermal depletion, and total densities with N0 , \u00d1 and N\nthe corresponding equilibrium condensate, thermal depletion, and total number of particles. We emphasize\nagain that the number of particles in this equilibrium\nsystem is conserved. By neglecting the thermal depletion \u00d1 , we arrive at the equilibrium equation of state for\nthe Bogoliubov approximation. We notice that singleparticle orbits for the condensate and thermal depletion\nparticles are governed by two different Hamiltonians, and\ntherefore, they are not generally orthogonal. However,\nfor a uniform system, these single-particle orbits are simple orthogonal plane waves. We also notice that there is\na gap in the single-particle spectrum\nlim \u03b5~HF\nk\n~\nk\u21920\n\n= g\u03c10 .\n\n(35)\n\nThis gap has important effects on many properties of a\nBose-condensed system [23]. We will come back this issue\nin the last section.\nIn this paper, we concern its effect on the stability of\nthe system, as we shall show in the following.\nWe define a thermal depletion single-particle Green\nfunction for the static hHF\nG\u0303HF (~k; i\u03c9n ) =\n\n1\n.\ni\u03c9n \u2212 \u03b5~HF\nk\n\n(36)\n\n\f6\nThe number of thermal depletion particles is found to be\n\u00d1 = \u2212\n\n\u03a9\n1 X\nG\u0303HF (~k; i\u03c9n ) = 3 g3/2 (z),\n\u03b2\n\u03bbT\n\n(37)\n\nn,~\nk6=0\n\np\nwhere \u03bbT = 2\u03c0/mkB T and z = e\u03b2(\u03bc\u22122g\u03c1) = e\u2212\u03b2g\u03c10\nand g\u03b3 (z) is the Bose function. Equation (37) is the\nequation of state equivalent to Eq. (32) for the thermal\ndepletion particles. The self-consistent relations among\nN , N0 , \u00d1 and \u03bc are given by Eq. (31) and\nN (\u03bc) = N0 (\u03bc) + \u00d1 (\u03bc) = N0 (\u03bc) +\n\n\u03a9\ng3/2 [z(\u03bc)]. (38)\n\u03bb3T\n\nThe number-of-particle fluctuation can be calculated\nby substituting Eq.

Similar calculations for the RPA\nwithout the exchange show that h\u03b4 \u00d1 2 i follows the N 4/3\nanomalous scaling law, but the total number-of-particle\nfluctuation is\nh\u03b4 N\u0302 2 i\n\u2202N\n= kB T\nN\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03b4U c and \u03b4U \u00f1 are the spatially and time-varying\nexternal potentials for the condensate and thermal depletion components. We emphasize here that the matrix\nform (46) of the density response function is simply a\nresult by splitting the system into a condensate and a\nthermal depletion component, in which the number of\nparticles is conserved, instead of a result of using the\nbroken U (1) gauge symmetry (3) as claimed by Minguzzi\nand Tosi [14]. The total density response function is then\ngiven by\n\u03c7nn = \u03c7cc + \u03c7c\u00f1 + \u03c7\u00f1c + \u03c7\u00f1\u00f1 .\n\n\u0001\n\u03b2\ng1/2 e\u2212\u03b2g\u03c10 .\n3\n\u03bbT\n\n(41)\n\nEquation (40) reduces to Eq.

This is not surprising, since below the critical temperature, the presence\nof the condensate pins down the chemical potential to\nbe \u03bc = 2g \u03c1\u0303 + g\u03c10 and Eq. (38) is a self-consistent relation between N and \u03bc. Even in the Bogoliubov approximation, it is this self-consistent relation that predicts a\nnumber-of-particle fluctuation given by Eq.

From the above two equations,\nthe four components are found\n\u03c7cc = (1 \u2212 2g\u03c70\u00f1 )D\u22121 \u03c70c , \u03c7\u00f1\u00f1 = (1 \u2212 g\u03c70c )D\u22121 \u03c7\u00f10 ,\n\n\u03c7c\u00f1 = 2g\u03c70c D\u22121 \u03c7\u00f10 ,\n\n\u03c7\u00f1c = 2g\u03c70\u00f1 D\u22121 \u03c70c ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere\nD = (1 \u2212 g\u03c70c )(1 \u2212 2g\u03c70\u00f1 ) \u2212 4g 2 \u03c70c \u03c70\u00f1 .\n\n(50)\n\nFor homogenous systems, the density response functions of the condensate and of the thermal depletion component can be obtained by linearizing the time-dependent\nGross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate around Eq.\n(31), and the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation for\nthe non-condensate around Eq. (32), respectively. They\nare given by\n\u03c70c (~q; i\u03c9n ) =\n\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n ) =\n\n2\u03c10 \u03b5q~\n,\n(i\u03c9n )2 \u2212 \u03b5q2~\n\u00f1q~+~k \u2212 \u00f1~k\n1 X\n\u03a9\n\n~\nk6=0,\u2212~\nq\n\n(51)\n\ni\u03c9n + \u03b5HF~ \u2212 \u03b5~HF\nq\n~+k\n\nk\n\n(52)\n\n\f7\nHF\n\nwhere \u00f1~k = (z \u22121 e\u03b2\u03b5~k \u2212 1)\u22121 is the occupation number\nof the static Hartree-Fock single-particle level of the thermal depletion particles. Therefore, the total density re-\n\nsponse function for the homogenous Bose-condensed system is\n\nh\ni\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(i\u03c9n )2 \u2212 \u03b5q2~ \u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n ) + 2\u03c1\u03b5q~ 1 + g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )\ni\n.\n\u03c7nn (~\nq ; i\u03c9n ) = h\n(i\u03c9n )2 \u2212 \u03b5q2~ [1 \u2212 2g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )] \u2212 2\u03c1\u03b5q~ [1 + 2g\u03c7\u00f10 (~q; i\u03c9n )]\n\nNow substituting Eq.

(41). One can see that Eq. (54) is exactly the\nsame as Eq. (40).\nWe have shown the total number-of-particle fluctuation is normal and consistent between statics and dynamics in the RPAE, and therefore, the interacting Bose\nsystem is proved to be stable. In the above derivations,\nthe number of particles is conserved and there is not any\nanomalous number-of-particle fluctuation. This is because in this RPAE, the numbers of particles in the condensate and thermal depletion component are not time-\n\ndependent [19] and do not change with the external potential because of entropy conservation [24]. Therefore,\nthey always take the equilibrium values. The above results can be derived in a more general time-dependent\nHartree-Fock scheme which preserves the U (1) gauge\nsymmetry [23].\nNow in order to see how the anomalous fluctuation\narises when the broken U (1) gauge symmetry is used, we\ncan follow the steps in Ref. [22] to build the vertex function \u039b\u03b1 , self-energy \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 , and the single-particle Green\nfunction G\u03b1\u03b2 by using using Eqs. (31) and (32) as the\nreference. This means that the equilibrium condensate\nN0 , thermal depletion \u00d1 , and Eq. (36) should be used to\nbuild up \u039b\u03b1 , \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 , and regular \u03c7R , not the as yet to be\ndetermined N0\u2032 , G\u03b1\u03b2 , and Nnc . Here we skip those steps\nand just cite the final results for the single-particle Green\nfunction matrix below\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[i\u03c9n \u2212 \u03b5q~ ] 1 \u2212 2g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n ) + g\u03c10 1 + g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )\ni\n,\nG++ (~\nq ; i\u03c9n ) = G\u2212\u2212 (~\nq ; \u2212i\u03c9n ) = h\n(i\u03c9n )2 \u2212 \u03b5q2~ [1 \u2212 2g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )] \u2212 2\u03c10 \u03b5q~ [1 + 2g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )]\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng\u03c10 1 + g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )\ni\nG+\u2212 (~\nq ; i\u03c9n ) = G\u2212+ (~\nq ; i\u03c9n ) = \u2212 h\n.\n(i\u03c9n )2 \u2212 \u03b5q2~ [1 \u2212 2g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )] \u2212 2\u03c10 \u03b5q~ [1 + 2g\u03c70\u00f1 (~q; i\u03c9n )]\n\nand the density response function \u03c7nn (~\nq ; i\u03c9n ), which is\nsame as Eq. (53).\nSince both the equilibrium state and the density response function are the same as in RPAE, therefore, one\ngets the same consistent normal number-of-particle fluctuations from statics and dynamics in this dielectric formalism as those in the RPAE [22].\nThe chemical potential from the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem in this approximation turns out to be\n\u03bcHP = \u03a3++ (0; 0) \u2212 \u03a3+\u2212 (0; 0) = g\u03c10 + 2g \u03c1\u0303,\n\n(56)\n\nwhich is the exactly the same as Eq. (31).\nUsing G++ (~q; i\u03c9n ), the number non-condensate par2\nticles Nnc and its fluctuation h\u03b4Nnc\ni are found to be\n\n(53)\n\n(55)\n\nthe same as Eqs. (25), (29) and (30). For a dilute gas\n\u03c1a3 \u226a 1, where a = gm\n4\u03c0 , P\u0303 is usually very small because\nof the single-particle gap [23]. It is thus straightforward\nto show that the single-particle Green function G\u03b1\u03b2 given\nby Eq. (55) has the similar form as that in Bogoliubov\napproximationh for small ~k. For example,\nthe pole is given\ni\nby \u03c9~k \u2248 cB k 1 + 2g P\u0303 (~k, \u03c9 = cB k) . Therefore, following the steps as in the Bogoliubov approximation, one\ncan show that h\u03b4Nnc i follows the \u03b3 = 4/3 scaling law.\nSince \u00d1 from Eq. (37) is the number of thermal depletion particles, the difference\n\u03b4N0 = Nnc \u2212 \u00d1\n\n(57)\n\n\f8\ncan be interpreted as the number of particles excited out\nof the condensate by the oscillation of the whole system\ninduced by the external time-dependent potential. Indeed, in the Bogoliubov approximation \u03b4N0 = Nnc since\nthe depletion of the condensate is completely caused by\nthe dynamic collective excitation. Therefore, the singleparticle Green functions (55) can be interpreted as dynamic ones comparing to the thermal depletion G\u0303HF defined by Eq. (36). As in Bogoliubov approximation, this\ninterpretation is allowed only because of the broken U (1)\ngauge symmetry. The total number of particles is expressed as\nN = N0\u2032 + Nnc ,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere N0\u2032 = N0 \u2212 \u03b4N0 . When substituting Eq. (58) into\nEq. (1) to calculate the number-of-particle fluctuation,\nthe anomalous fluctuation due to Nnc is exactly canceled\nout by the one from N0\u2032 , so that the total number-ofparticle fluctuation is normal, which is given by Eq. (40).\nWe can see that the anomalous fluctuation of the num2\ni is solely due to the\nber of non-condensate particles h\u03b4Nnc\nsingle-particle Green functions defined by Eq. (10) whose\npoles entangle the single-particle and particle-conserving\ncollective excitations, a directly consequence of the U (1)\nsymmetry breaking rather than an implication of the instability of the Bose system since the total number-ofparticle fluctuation is normal and consistent from statics\nand dynamics. More than thirty years ago, Straley advised caution [25] in using such a single-particle Green\nfunction to describe the zero-sound characteristic spectrum of the superfluid 4 He. Leggett also argued [19] that\nthere are no circumstances in which Eq. (3) is physically\ncorrect.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe have shown that the anomalous fluctuation of the\nnumber of non-condensate particles is an intrinsic feature\nof the broken U (1) gauge symmetry and is completely\nabsent in the RPAE in which the U (1) gauge symmetry\nis preserved. This may be just related to the different\ninterpretations of the dynamic process of the condensate\nof these models, as we point out in previous sections. But\nsince this anomalous fluctuation of the number of noncondensate particles has not any physical significance,\nwe can safely say that it is just a by-product of using the\nbroken U (1) gauge symmetry.\nAn advantage to keep the U (1) gauge symmetry is that\nthe single-particle spectrum and the collective excitation\nspectrum are distinguished. As shown in the RPAE, they\nare the poles of thermal depletion single-particle Green\nfunction and the density response function, respectively.\nBut single-particle spectrum has important effects on the\n\ncollective mode. For example, because of the gap, \u03c7\u00f10 is\nquite small for a dilute gas so that the thermal depletion\ncomponent does not sustain a zero sound mode. The\nwhole effect of the thermal depletion particles is to shift\nthe Bogoliubov mode. Also the gap causes the damping\nof the thermal depletion particles to the collective mode\nexponentially decreases when the temperature drops. As\nwe recently discussed [23], this single-particle gap is also\nresponsible for the completely screening of the external\npotential by the condensate.\nBy using the broken U (1) gauge symmetry, the boundary of the single-particle spectrum and the collective\nmode are entangled together if the poles of G\u03b1\u03b2 are interpreted as the single-particle excitations. But as far\nas the dielectric formalism in Ref. [22] concerned, there\nis a gapped single-particle spectrum as same as that in\nthe RPAE for the equilibrium reference. In this sense, a\ngapped single-particle spectrum and a gapless collective\nmode do coexist even in the dielectric formalism. This\nis another point to identify the equilibrium state with\nwhich the density response function is calculated.\nAs pointed out by Meier and Zwerger [5], the anomalous fluctuation of the non-condensate particles is related\nto the gapless mode in the superfluid Bose system. Our\nanalysis shows this is the case if one uses the broken Bose\nU (1) gauge symmetry. In the RPAE, which preserves this\ngauge symmetry, there is no such an anomalous numberof-particle fluctuation related to the gapless superfluid\nmode.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that in models using\nthe broken U (1) gauge symmetry, the number-of-particle\nfluctuation is normal and can be calculated consistently\nfrom the static thermodynamic relation and dynamic\ncompressibility sum rule if the equilibrium states are\nidentified. We also show that the chemical potential determined from the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem should also\nbe consistent with that determined from the equilibrium\nequation of state. The N 4/3 anomalous fluctuation of\nthe number of non-condensate particles is an intrinsic\nfeature of the broken U (1) gauge symmetry. However,\nthis anomalous fluctuation does not imply the instability of the system. Using the RPAE, which preserves the\nU (1) gauge symmetry, such an anomalous fluctuation of\nthe number of non-condensate particles is completely absent.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF Grant No.\nDMR0454699.
