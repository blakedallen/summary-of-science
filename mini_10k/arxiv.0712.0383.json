In a companion paper, we explored this connection by applying a variety\nof statistics to SDSS data. In particular, we showed that specific star formation rates\nof galaxies are higher if they have close neighbours. Here we apply exactly the same\ntechniques to AGN in the survey, showing that close neighbours are not associated\nwith any similar enhancement of nuclear activity. Star formation is enhanced in AGN\nwith close neighbours in exactly the same way as in inactive galaxies, but the accretion\nrate onto the black hole, as estimated from the extinction-corrected [O iii] luminosity,\nis not influenced by the presence or absence of companions. Previous work has shown\nthat galaxies with more strongly accreting black holes contain more young stars in\ntheir inner regions. This leads us to conclude that star formation induced by a close\ncompanion and star formation associated with black hole accretion are distinct events.\nThese events may be part of the same physical process, for example a merger, provided\nthey are separated in time. In this case, accretion onto the black hole and its associated star formation would occur only after the two interacting galaxies have merged.\nThe major caveat in this work is our assumption that the extinction-corrected [O iii]\nluminosity is a robust indicator of the bolometric luminosity of the central black hole.\nIt is thus important to check our results using indicators of AGN activity at other\nwavelengths.\nKey words: galaxies: clustering - galaxies: distances and redshifts - large-scale structure of Universe - cosmology: theory - dark matter\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn Li et al. (2007, hereafter Paper I) we used a variety of\nstatistics to study the small-scale clustering properties of a\nsample of 105 star-forming galaxies selected from the data\nrelease 4 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al.\n2000). We cross-correlated star-forming galaxies with reference samples drawn from the main spectroscopic survey and\nfrom the photometric catalogue (which is complete down to\nsignificantly fainter limiting magnitudes). We also calculated\nthe average enhancement in star formation rate as a function\nof the projected distance to companion galaxies. Our results\nsupported a picture in which enhanced star formation activity and galaxy interactions are closely linked. At the highest\nspecific star formation rates, almost all galaxies were found\nto have a close companion or be in the process of merging.\nGalaxies with the highest specific star formation rates were\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: leech@mpa-garching.mpg.de\n\nc 2007 RAS\n\nalso found to be more concentrated, suggesting that these\nmerger-driven interactions were building up their bulge components. These results are in accord with gas-dynamical\nsimulations of mergers of disk galaxies, which show that\nsubstantial fraction of the gas in the galaxy can be driven\ntowards the center of the galaxy by gravitational torques,\nwhere it can fuel a central starburst (Negroponte & White\n1983; Mihos & Hernquist 1996).\nThe discovery of a tight correlation between black\nhole mass and bulge mass or velocity dispersion in galaxies (Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) has\nmotivated many theoretical models in which accretion\nonto black holes and AGN activity are assumed to be\nclosely linked to galaxy interactions and mergers (see\nfor example Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Cattaneo 2001;\nGranato et al. 2001; Wyithe & Loeb 2002; Di Matteo et al.\n2003; Cattaneo et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2005; Kang et al.\n2005; Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006). In many of\nthese models , a few per cent of the gas in the merging galax-\n\n\f2\n\nLi et al.\n\nies is accreted by the black hole and shines with a radiative\nefficiency of around 10% over a time scale of a few \u00d7107\nyears. With these simple assumptions, many of the observed\nfeatures of the cosmological evolution of quasars appear to\nbe reasonably well reproduced. It is therefore interesting to\nexplore whether we can find any empirical evidence for a\nconnection between merging and AGN activity in the real\nUniverse. Previous observational studies have yielded contradictory results (see for example Petrosian 1982; Dahari\n1984, 1985; Keel et al. 1985; Fuentes-Williams & Stocke\n1988; Virani, De Robertis, & VanDalfsen 2000; Schmitt\n2001; Miller et al. 2003; Grogin et al. 2005; Waskett et al.\n2005; Koulouridis et al. 2006; Serber et al. 2006). It is thus\nuseful to carry out a careful analysis of a large and homogeneous sample of AGN.\nIn Li et al. (2006), we presented results on the clustering of AGN selected from the SDSS. Our study did not yield\nany evidence that AGN activity is triggered by interactions\nwith nearby companions. Instead we found that AGN are\nclustered more weakly than control samples of non-AGN on\nscales between 100 kpc and 1 Mpc. We interpreted this antibias as evidence that AGN activity is favoured in galaxies\nthat are located at the centres of their own dark matter\nhalos, and disfavoured in \"satellite galaxies\" that orbit together with many other galaxies within a common halo.\nThe purpose of this short paper is to bring our results on\nstar-forming galaxies and AGN together. We analyze starforming galaxies and AGN in exactly the same way, using\nthe same set of statistics, and we compare and contrast the\nresults that are obtained for the two kinds of galaxy. We\nthen discuss the implications of our results for understanding\nthe connection between star formation, AGN activity and\ngalaxy interactions\n\n2\n\nINDICATORS OF STAR FORMATION AND\nAGN ACTIVITY\n\nOur basic indicator of star formation activity in galaxies\nis the specific star formation rate , which is defined as the\nstar formation rate of the galaxy measured within the 3\narcsecond SDSS fibre aperture divided by the stellar mass of\nthe galaxy measured within this same aperture. Extinctioncorrected star formation rates are estimated using a variety\nof emission lines as described in Brinchmann et al. (2004).\nOur indicator of AGN activity is the quantity L[O\niii]/MBH , where L[O iii] is the [O iii]\u03bb5007 emission line luminosity in solar units and MBH is the black hole mass (in\nsolar masses) estimated from the measured stellar velocity\ndispersion of the galaxy using the fitting formula provided\nby Tremaine et al. (2002). As discussed in Kauffmann et al.\n(2003, hereafter K03), the contribution to the [O iii] luminosity from [H II] regions is small in nearby AGN. The [O iii]\nline is expected to come almost exclusively from the narrowline region, making it an excellent probe of accretion onto\nthe central supermassive black hole. Additional support for\nthe [O iii] line luminosity as an accretion rate indicator is\nprovided by the study of a hard X-ray selected sample of\n47 AGN by Heckman et al. (2005), which showed that the\n3-20 keV and [O iii] luminosities were well-correlated over a\nrange of about 4 orders of magnitude.\nThe main drawback of the [O iii] emission line is that\n\nit is affected by dust extinction. Hopkins et al. (2005) developed a model in which the lifetime and visibility of quasars\nis intimately connected with obscuration inside merging systems. In their model, mergers funnel gas to galaxy centres, fuelling starbursts and feeding black hole growth, but\nthe quasars remain \"buried\" until accretion-related feedback disperses the obscuring material and they are revealed.\nEventually, activity ceases as the remnants settle down and\nthe accretion rate drops. In such a model obscuration effects vary dramatically as a system ages. Here, we attempt\nto correct the [O iii] luminosity for dust obscuration using the value of the Balmer decrement measured from the\ngalaxy spectrum (see K03). This is of course a crude correction, because the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 line line fluxes are likely to\nbe dominated by emission from H II regions that may be\nspread over a larger spatial scale than the gas clouds that\ncontribute to high-ionization emission lines such as [O iii].\nNevertheless, we believe that correcting for dust in this way\nwill improve the correlation between our AGN activity indicator and the bolometric luminosity of the central black\nhole.\nWe note that the majority of AGN in our sample\nare relatively low-luminosity objects with [O iii] line luminosities well below those of typical high-redshift quasars.\nHeckman et al. (2004) showed that high-mass black holes\nare accreting very little at the present day; only black holes\nof 108 M\u2299 or less continue to accrete and to grow at a significant rate. The SDSS optical AGN sample includes 4680 objects with log L[O iii]/MBH > 1. This cut selects the \u223c 5% of\nour AGN sample with the most rapidly growing black holes.\nAccording to the calibration between [O iii] line luminosity\nand accretion rate given in Heckman et al. (2004), and taking account the average extinction correction that we apply\nhere to the [O iii] line, the black holes in these galaxies are\naccreting at approximately a tenth of Eddington or more.\nEven though these AGN may have significantly lower [O iii]\nluminosities than high-redshift quasars, they are as powerful as these quasars when their luminosities are expressed\nin Eddington units. We thus believe that they can provide\nvaluable insight into the processes that are responsible for\ntriggering strong AGN activity.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nOur sample of star-forming galaxies is the same as described\nin Paper I. The sample of AGN used here is the same as in\nLi et al. (2006). In short, the parent sample is composed of\n397,344 objects which have been spectroscopically confirmed\nas galaxies and have data publicly available in the SDSS\nData Release 4 (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2006). AGN and\nstar-forming galaxies are selected from the subset of galaxies\nwith S/N > 3 in the four emission lines [O iii]\u03bb5007, H\u03b2, [N\nII]\u03bb6583 and H\u03b1, following the criteria proposed by K03.\nOur methodology for evaluating the clustering properties of these galaxies has already been described in Paper I,\nso we will turn directly to our results.\n3.1\n\nCross-correlation functions\n\nIn Figure 1, we compare projected redshift-space 2-point\ncross-correlation functions (2PCF) wp (rp ) for our sample\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fInteractions, star formation and AGN activity\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Projected redshift-space two-point cross-correlation functions wp (rp ) between all high S/N star-forming galaxies and our\nreference sample (left) and between all AGN and our reference sample (right). Different lines correspond to star-forming galaxies with\ndifferent specific star formation rates, or to AGN with different accretion rates, as indicated. See the text for a more detailed description.\n\nof star-forming galaxies (left) and AGN (right). Results for\nthe whole sample are plotted in black. Results for the 25%\nof galaxies with the smallest values of SFR/M\u2217 and L[O\niii]/MBH are plotted in blue. Results for the 25% of galaxies with the highest values of SFR/M\u2217 and L[O iii]/MBH\nare plotted in red. The left panel shows that galaxies with\nhigh specific star formation rates are more strongly clustered than galaxies with low specific star formation rates on\nscales less than 100 h\u22121 kpc and that the difference in clustering amplitude increases as one goes to smaller values of\nrp . The right panel shows that AGN display quite different\nbehaviour. AGN with the highest values of the Eddington\nparameter L[O iii]/MBH are more weakly clustered on scales\nbetween 30 kpc and 1 Mpc. At the smallest values of rp , the\nclustering amplitude exhibits no dependence on AGN power.\nThese results are shown again in more detail in Figure 2,\nwhere we plot the amplitude of the the 2PCF as a function\nof SFR/M\u2217 and as a function of L[O iii]/MBH for three\ndifferent values of the projected separation (rp = 0.05, 0.5\nand 5h\u22121 Mpc). We extend the results to lower values of\nSFR/M\u2217 using the sample of low S/N star-forming galaxies\ndescribed in Paper I. It is interesting that the trends are\nqualitatively similar for the two kinds of object, except on\nthe smallest scales where the clustering amplitude increases\nsubstantially for the large values of SFR/M\u2217 , but exhibits\nno dependence on the Eddington parameter L[O iii]/MBH .\nWe note that this lack of dependence extends up to the\nvery highest values of log L[O iii]/MBH , corresponding to\nblack holes that are accreting at more than a tenth of the\nEddington rate.\nFor both star-forming galaxies and AGN, the smallscale clustering amplitude increases strongly towards low\nvalues of SFR/M\u2217 and L[O iii]/MBH . This is most likely\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\nnot a signature of mergers or interactions. In a recent paper,\nBarton et al. (2007) use cosmological N-body simulations to\nshow that a substantial fraction of close galaxy pairs reside\nin cluster or group-size halos. It is well known that the star\nformation rates of galaxies are lower in these environments\n(e.g. Balogh et al. 1999), and the same is probably true of\nthe average accretion rate onto the central black hole (K03).\nThe upturn in clustering amplitude for galaxies with low\nvalues of SFR/M\u2217 and for weak AGN is thus a signature of\ngalaxies \"shutting down\" in the most massive halos.\n\n3.2\n\nNeighbour Counts\n\nAs in Paper I, we compute the number of galaxies in the\nphotometric reference sample in the vicinity of star-forming\ngalaxies and AGN and we make a statistical correction for\nthe effect of chance projections. We have trimmed the AGN\nand star-forming samples so that they each have the same\ndistribution in redshift and stellar mass. In Figure 3 we plot\nthe average background-subtracted neighbour count within\na given value of the projected radius rp . Results are shown\nfor star-forming galaxies in different intervals of SFR/M\u2217\nand AGN in different intervals of log10 (L[O iii]/MBH ). The\nphotometric reference sample is always limited at rpho =\n20.0. We see a clear trend for an increase in the average\nnumber of close neighbours around the most strongly starforming galaxies, but not around the most powerful AGN.\n\n3.3\n\n\"Enhancement\" functions\n\nIn Paper I, we computed the background-corrected,\nneighbour-count-weighted enhancement in specific star formation rate for galaxies as a function of projected neighbour\n\n\f4\n\nLi et al.\n\nFigure 2. Projected two-point cross-correlations wp (rp ), normalized by the expectation for a power-law 3-D correlation function \u03be(r) =\n(r/5h\u22121 M pc)\u22121.8 and measured at the rp values indicated in each panel, are plotted as a function of log10 SF R/M\u2217 for star-forming\ngalaxies (top panels) and as a function of log10 (L[O iii]/MBH ) for AGN (bottom panels).\n\ndistance, The reader is referred to Paper I for definitions and\nfor further details about the method.\nFigure 4 compares the enhancement in specific star formation rate (left) with the enhancement in the level of nuclear activity, as measured by the quantity log L[O iii]/MBH\n(right). The top panels show the enhancement functions as\nfunction of projected separation rp , while in the bottom\npanel the separation is scaled by dividing by R90, the radius\nthat encloses 90% of the r-band light of the galaxy.\nAs can be seen, AGN behave very differently to star\nforming galaxies. Accretion onto the black hole is suppressed\nfor galaxies with companions with projected separations between \u223c 100 kpc \u2013 1 Mpc, and there is no evidence that the\nnuclear activity level is enhanced above the mean at small\nneighbour separations. The most plausible explanation for\nthe suppression on intermediate scales is that the majority of\nAGN with close neighbours are located in groups and clusters and the suppression of nuclear activity is a larger-scale\n\nenvironmental effect, similar to the morphology-density or\nSFR-density relations. This hypothesis is in accord with the\nAGN clustering model of Li et al. (2006), in which AGN activity is suppressed in satellite galaxies relative to central\ngalaxies.\nIn Figure 5, we show how the enhancement functions\ndepend on stellar mass for both the star-forming and the\nAGN samples. The suppression of AGN activity in galaxies\nwith companions with rp = 0.1 \u2212 1 Mpc does depend on\nstellar mass \u2013 the effect is clearly much stronger for the\nmost massive galaxies. However, there is again no evidence\nthat AGN activity is triggered by the presence of a close\ncompanion in the way seen for star-formation activity at all\nstellar masses. We find similar trends when we split our AGN\nsample by a structural parameter such as the concentration\nindex C. There is stronger intermediate scale suppression for\nmore concentrated galaxies, but no evidence for significant\ntriggering by close companions in any of our subsamples.\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fInteractions, star formation and AGN activity\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Average counts of galaxies in the photometric sample to an r-band limiting magnitude of rlim = 20 within a given projected\nradius rp from the star-forming galaxies (left) and from the AGN (right). Different symbols are for star-forming galaxies in different\nintervals of log10 SF R/M\u2217 or for AGN in different intervals of log10 (L[O iii]/MBH ), as indicated.\n\nOur goal in this paper is to understand whether there is\na connection between interactions, enhanced star formation,\nand enhanced AGN activity for SDSS galaxies. In Paper I,\nwe argued that there is a clear connection between galaxy interactions and enhanced star formation. We also argued that\ngalaxy interactions are not only sufficient but also necessary\nto trigger the strongest starbursts. In K03, we demonstrated\nthat powerful AGN have significantly younger stellar populations than non-AGN of the same stellar mass. Clearly,\nthere is a connection between interactions and enhanced\nstar formation, and there is a connection between strong\nAGN activity and enhanced star formation. The third link,\na connection between interactions and strong AGN activity,\nappears to be missing..\nTo illustrate this more clearly, we have created subsamples of AGN and high S/N star-forming galaxies that\nare closely matched in redshift, stellar mass and concentration index C. This is illustrated in detail in Figure 6. As\ncan be seen, the full star-forming and AGN samples differ\nsubstantially in their distributions of both stellar mass and\nconcentration index. We have shown that the enhancement\nfunctions are quite strongly dependent on these two parameters. Thus, if we want to make a direct comparison between\nstar-forming galaxies and AGN, we need to create matched\nsubsamples. We can then investigate whether these matched\nsubsamples show identical trends in star formation enhancement as a function of neighbour distance. Our results are\nshown in Figure 7. Because the luminosities of the higherionization emission lines are strongly affected by the central\nsource, star formation rates cannot be estimated very accurately for AGN. We focus instead on the H\u03b1 luminosity of\na galaxy normalized to its stellar mass M\u2217 . As discussed in\nK03, H\u03b1 line luminosities are very similar in AGN and in\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\nsamples of star-forming galaxies that are matched in 4000 \u00c5\nbreak strength, proving that most of the H\u03b1 emission arises\nfrom H II regions in both cases.\nFigure 7 shows that on small scales, the behaviour of\nthis indicator as a function of scaled separation is the same\nin the star-forming galaxies and in the AGN. This suggests\nthat interactions are regulating star formation rates in our\nsample of AGN in exactly the same way as in our sample\nof star-forming galaxies! In Figure 8, we plot the enhancement in L[O iii]/MBH for the AGN contained in the matched\nsample. The suppression in nuclear activity level at intermediate scales is no longer quite as strong as in our full sample,\nbecause the AGN in the matched sample have significantly\nlower stellar masses and concentrations. However, we still do\nnot see any significant trend for nuclear activity to increase\nas the separation between the galaxy and its neighbours gets\nsmaller. We conclude that, unlike enhanced star formation,\naccretion onto the black hole is not directly connected to\ninteractions for local AGN.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe basic conclusion of this paper is very simple. A strong\nconnection between galaxy interactions and enhanced star\nformation is found no matter what statistic we employ. However, we fail to find any corresponding relation between enhanced AGN activity and interactions. The interpretation\nof what this implies for the starburst-AGN connection is far\nfrom obvious.\nWe know from previous work (e.g. Kauffmann et al.\n2003, ; K03) that galaxies with powerful AGN tend to have\nyounger-than-average stellar populations. K03 found that\nAGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive\n\n\f6\n\nLi et al.\n\nFigure 4.

The hosts of the AGN\nwith high [O iii] luminosities, on the other hand, have much\nyounger mean stellar ages than \"normal\" galaxies of the\nsame mass. This establishes that there is a physical connection between accretion onto the central black hole and the\npresence of young stars in the inner galaxy.\nThere is also a clear physical connection between galaxy\ninteractions and enhanced levels of star formation. This is\n\ntrue not only for \"normal\" galaxies, but also for the host\ngalaxies of the AGN in our samples. Figure 7 shows that\nstar formation rates in AGN hosts with a close companion\nare enhanced in exactly the same way as in normal starforming galaxies. However, we consistently fail to find any\nevidence that the black hole accretion rate , as measured by\nthe quantity L[O iii]/MBH , increases if a galaxy has a close\ncompanion.\nThese results are summarized in Figure 9. This plot\nshows how star formation in AGN is enhanced in the plane\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fInteractions, star formation and AGN activity\n\n7\n\nFigure 5.

In the upper bar, the scaled, weighted\naverage value of log(H\u03b1)/M\u2217 ) is plotted as a function of projected separation for the same sample of AGN.

The AGN and star-forming galaxy samples are matched with each other in redshift, stellar mass and concentration\nindex. The limiting magnitude of AGN and star-forming galaxies is fixed at r = 17.6, but the apparent magnitude limit of the reference\ngalaxy sample is varied as indicated.\n\nthe average of the 2-D plot over all accretion rates at each\ncompanion distance.\nThe enhancement in star formation as a function of L[O\niii]/MBH is clearly seen in this diagram. It is also clear from\nFigure 9 that the average value of L[O iii]/MBH in our sample has no dependence on neighbour distance. The apparent\nnarrowing in the distribution at low values of the scaled separation is simply the result of poorer sample statistics. Finally , it is striking that the degree to which star formation is\nenhanced as a function of projected separation between the\nAGN and its companions is considerably weaker than the\nenhancement that occurs as the black hole accretion rate\nincreases. This point can be seen by comparing the upper\nbar in Figure 9 with the main panel.\nThese results lead us to the conclusion that star formation enhancement due to a close companion and star formation enhancement due to an accreting black hole are two\nseparate and distinct events. These two events may be part\nof the same underlying physical process (such as a merger),\nprovided they are well separated in time. In this case, accretion onto the black hole and its associated star formation\nwould occur only after the two interacting galaxies have already merged.\nIn a recent paper, Yuan et al (2007,in preparation)\nhave studied starburst and AGN activity in infrared-selected\ngalaxies, including ULIRGs. These authors study how the\nrelative fraction of objects classified as starburst or AGN\nchange as the merger event progresses . They find that there\nis no significant change in fraction of galaxies with AGN activity until the two galactic nuclei have merged. The single\nnucleus post-merger phase is divided into three classes, according to the K-band core-to-total ratio and morphology.\nThe authors find that for ULIRGS there is a particular stage\n\n(the \"diffuse merger\" stage) where the nuclei have merged\nbut not yet formed a core, where there is a substantial rise\nin composite HII-AGN activity. Once the core forms (the\nso-called \"compact merger\" stage), this composite activity\nchanges into mostly pure Seyfert activity. In another recent\npaper, Ellison et al. (2008) have analyzed the star formation\nrates and AGN activity for a sample of 1716 paired galaxies\nselected from the SDSS, and also find that if AGN activity is associated with merger-triggered star formation, the\ntimescales must be longer for the former than for the latter.\nThese results appear the support the hypothesis that\nthere is a significant time delay between the onset of the\ninteraction and the phase in which the black hole is able to\naccrete. This delay hypothesis can be tested by using empirical measures of galaxy morphology that are more sensitive\nto the later stages of the merging event. Examples include\nasymmetry indices (Abraham et al. 1996; Conselice et al.\n2000) or the \"lopsidedness\" parameter (Reichard et al.\n2007).\nA major caveat in all the analysis presented in this paper is the assumption that the extinction-corrected [O iii]\nluminosity is a reasonably robust indicator of the bolometric\nluminosity of the central black hole. This is the only indicator of accretion that is available to us for our sample of\nAGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It will be extremely\nimportant to check the results presented in this paper using\nindicators of AGN activity at other wavelengths.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nCL is supported by the Joint Postdoctoral Programme\nin Astrophysical Cosmology of Max Planck Institute\nc 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fInteractions, star formation and AGN activity\n\n9\n\nStates Naval Observatory, and the University of Washington.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFigure 8.
