Integral cluster categories of acyclic quivers have recently\nbeen used in the representation-theoretic approach to quantum cluster\nalgebras. We show that over a principal ideal domain, such categories\nbehave much better than one would expect: They can be described as\norbit categories, their indecomposable rigid objects do not depend on\nthe ground ring and the mutation operation is transitive.\n\n1. introduction\nCluster categories were introduced in [3] for acyclic quivers and independently in [5] for Dynkin quivers of type A. They have played an important\nr\u00f4le in the study of Fomin-Zelevinsky's cluster algebras [9], cf. the surveys\n[2] [13] [15] [20] [21].\nIntegral cluster categories appear naturally in the study of quantum cluster algebras as defined and studied in [4] and [8]. Indeed, one would like to\ninterpret the quantum parameter q as the cardinality of a finite field [22]\nand in order to study the cluster categories over all prime fields simultaneously [19], one considers the cluster category over the ring of integers, cf. the\nappendix to [19]. In this paper, we continue the study begun there: For an\nacyclic quiver Q and a principal ideal domain R, we construct the cluster\ncategory CRQ using Amiot's method [1] as a triangle quotient of the perfect\nderived category of the Ginzburg dg algebra [10] associated with the path\norb as the category\nalgebra RQ. On the other hand, we define the category CRQ\nof orbits of the bounded derived category of RQ under the action of the\nautoequivalence \u03a3\u22122 S, where S is the Serre functor and \u03a3 the suspension\nfunctor. In the case where R is a field, cluster categories were originally\norb in [3] and it was shown in [1] that the two definitions are\ndefined as CRQ\nequivalent. Our first main result is the existence of a natural equivalence\nfor any principal ideal domain R\norb \u223c\nCRQ\n\u2192 CRQ .\n\nThis shows in particular that the orbit category is triangulated. For the\ncase where R is a field, this has been known since [14]; in the general case,\nit is quite surprising since the algebra RQ is of global dimension \u2264 2 and\nthe proof in [14] strongly used the fact that for a field F, the path algebra\nFQ is of global dimension \u2264 1.\nKey words and phrases. Cluster category, rigid objects, quiver representation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBERNHARD KELLER AND SARAH SCHEROTZKE\n\nOur second main result states that all indecomposable rigid objects of CRQ\nare either images of rigid indecomposable RQ-modules or direct factors of\nthe image of \u03a3RQ. If we combine this with Crawley-Boevey's classification\n[7] of rigid indecomposable RQ-modules, we obtain that the classification\nof the rigid indecomposable objects of CRQ is independent of the principal\nideal domain R and that iterated mutation starting from RQ reaches all\nindecomposable rigid objects. Again, this is well-known in the field case, cf.\n[3] [11] [12], but quite surprising in the general case.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In the second section, we recall general adjointness relations between the derived tensor and the derived Homfunctor for dg algebras over any commutative ring R. We define the (relative) Serre functor.\nIn the third section, we consider the derived category of an R-algebra\nA (finitely generated projective over R) and an endofunctor F of the derived category of A which is given by the derived tensor product with an\nA-bimodule complex \u0398. The tensor dg algebra associated with \u0398 is a differential graded algebra which we denote by \u0393. We give sufficient conditions for\nthe orbit category C orb of the perfect derived category per(A) by F to embed canonically into the triangulated quotient category per(\u0393)/Dper(R) (\u0393).\nHere Dper(R) (\u0393) denotes the derived category of the differential graded \u0393modules whose restrictions to R are perfect complexes. The methods used\nin this section generalize the approach used in [16] to algebras over arbitrary\ncommutative rings.\nIn the fourth section, we consider the orbit category of the perfect derived category per(RQ) under the action of the auto-equivalence given by\n\u03a3\u22122 S. This functor is given by the total derived functor associated with\nthe RQ-bimodule complex \u0398 = \u03a3\u22122 HomR (RQ, R). By a result of [16], the\ndifferential graded tensor algebra of \u0398 is isomorphic to the Ginzburg algebra\n\u0393 associated to the quiver Q with the zero potential. So using the results of\nthe third section, we can embed the orbit category into the integral cluster\ncategory per(\u0393)/Dper(R) (\u0393). Furthermore, we show in this section that a\nrelative 3-Calabi-Yau property holds for D(\u0393).\nIn the fifth section, under the assumption that R is a principal ideal\ndomain, we show that all rigid indecomposable objects in the integral cluster\ncategory come from modules and their suspensions and that the embedding\ngiven in section 3 is an equivalence of categories. Hence the orbit category\nC orb is triangulated and the integral cluster category is relative 2-CalabiYau. Using a result by Crawley-Boevey [7] we establish a bijection between\nthe rigid indecomposable objects in the cluster category over a field F and\nthose over a ring induced by the triangle functor ? \u2297L\nR F.\nIn the last section, we show using the bijection between rigid objects in\nCRQ and CF Q , that all cluster-tilting objects are related by mutations.\n\n\fTHE INTEGRAL CLUSTER CATEGORY\n\n3\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe second-named author thanks the 'Fondation Sciences Math\u00e9matiques\nde Paris' for a postdoctoral fellowship during which this project was carried\nout. Both authors are grateful to the referee for many helpful comments.\n2. Derived categories over commutative rings\nLet R be a commutative ring. For an associative differential graded Ralgebra A which is cofibrant as an R-module (cf. section 2.12 of [18]), we\ndenote by D(A) the derived category of dg A-modules, by per(A) the perfect\nderived category, i.e. the thick subcategory of D(A) generated by A, and by\nDper(R) (A) the full subcategory of D(A) whose objects are the dg A-modules\nwhose underlying complex of R-modules is perfect. Throughout this article,\nwe denote by \u03a3 the shift functor in the derived category. If the underlying\nR-module of A is finitely generated projective over R, we denote by SR\nthe (relative) Serre functor of D(A) given by the total derived functor of\ntensoring with the A-bimodule Hom.R (A, R). Here, for two dg A-modules L\nand M , we denote by Hom.A (L, M ) the dg R-module whose nth component is\nthe R-module of morphisms of graded A-modules f : L \u2192 M homogeneous\nof degree n and whose differential sends such an f to dM \u25e6 f \u2212 (\u22121)n f \u25e6 dL .\nWe denote by RHom the total derived functor of Hom. . We define Ae to be\nthe dg algebra A \u2297R Aop . The following well-known isomorphisms will often\nbe used in the rest of the article.\nLemma 2.1. Let A and B be two dg R-algebras which are cofibrant over R.\n(1) Let M \u2208 D(B \u2297 Aop ), L \u2208 D(A) and N \u2208 D(B). There is a bifunctorial isomorphism\n\u223c\nRHomB (L \u2297L\nA M, N ) \u2192 RHomA (L, RHomB (M, N ))\n\nin D(R).\n(2) For P \u2208 per(B) and M \u2208 D(B), there is a bifunctorial isomorphism\n\u223c\nM \u2297L\nB RHomB (P, B) \u2192 RHomB (P, M )\n\nin D(B op ).\n(3) For all L and M in D(A), there is a bifunctorial isomorphism\n\u223c\nRHomAe (A, RHomR (L, M )) \u2192\nRHomA (L, M )\n\nin D(Aop ) .\nProof. We denote by pM a cofibrant replacement of M and by iM a fibrant\n\u223c\nreplacement of M . We have L \u2297L\nA M = pL \u2297A pM . Therefore, we have\n.\nRHomB (L \u2297L\nA M, N ) = HomB (pL \u2297A pM, N )\n\u223c\n= Hom. (pL, Hom. (pM, N ))\nA\n\nB\n\n= RHomA (L, RHomB (M, N )).\n\n\f4\n\nBERNHARD KELLER AND SARAH SCHEROTZKE\n\nThis proves (1).\nFor part (2), we observe that we have a bifunctorial morphism from\npM \u2297B Hom.B (pP, B) to Hom.B (pP, pM ), which is invertible in D(R) for\nP = A hence for all objects in per(A).\nFor part (3), we have\nRHomAe (A, RHomR (L, M )) = Hom.Ae (pA, Hom.R (pL, iM )) ,\nwhere pA is a cofibrant as a dg Ae -module. Then pA is also cofibrant as a dg\nA-module and as a dg Aop -module. We have Hom.Ae (pA, Hom.R (pL, iM )) \u2282\nHom.Aop (pA, Hom.R (pL, iM )) and by (1), there is a bifunctorial isomorphism\nbetween Hom.Aop (pA, Hom.R (pL, iM )) and Hom.R (pA \u2297Aop pL, iM ). This\nisomorphism induces a bijection between Hom.Ae (pA, Hom.R (pL, iM )), which\nconsists of all the elements of Hom.Aop (pA, Hom.R (pL, iM )) that commute\nwith the right action of A, and Hom.A (pA \u2297Aop pL, iM ). Now Hom.A (pA \u2297A\npL, iM ) is isomorphic to RHomA (L, M ), which finishes the proof.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.2. Suppose that the underlying R-module of A is finitely\ngenerated projective. For L \u2208 D(A) and M \u2208 per(A), we have the following\ncanonical bifunctorial isomorphism\n\u223c\nRHomR (RHomA (M, SR L), R) \u2192\nRHomA (L, M ).\n\nIf HomR (A, R) belongs to per(A), then SR is an auto-equivalence of per(A)\nwith inverse RHomA (RHom(?, R), A).\nProof. By applying part (2) of 2.1 twice we obtain\nL\n\u223c\nRHomA (M, L \u2297L\nA RHomR (A, R)) = L \u2297A RHomA (M, RHomR (A, R)).\n\nBy part (1) of 2.1, we obtain\nRHomA (M, RHomR (A, R)) \u223c\n= RHomR (M, R).\nTherefore, we have\nRHomR (RHomA (M,L \u2297L\nA RHomR (A, R))), R)\n\u223c\n= RHomR (L \u2297L RHomR (M, R), R)\nA\n\n\u223c\n= RHomA (L, RHomR (RHomR (M, R), R))\n\u223c\n= RHomA (L, M )\nby (1) of 2.1. This proves the first part.\nIf we choose M = A, we get, by the first statement,\nSR L \u223c\n= RHomR (RHomA (L, A), R).\nNow we use the fact that RHomR (?, R) and RHomA (?, A) are duality functors on per(A).\n\u0003\n\n\fTHE INTEGRAL CLUSTER CATEGORY\n\n5\n\n3. Embeddings of orbit categories\nLet A be an associative R-algebra which is finitely generated projective\nas an R-module and let \u0398 be a complex of A-A-bimodules. We suppose that\n\u0398 is cofibrant as a dg A-bimodule and that \u0398 is perfect as a dg R-module.\nWe denote by F : D(A) \u2192 D(A) the functor ? \u2297L\nA \u0398. We define the dg\nalgebra \u0393 = TA (\u0398) to be the tensor algebra over A given by\nA \u2295 \u0398 \u2295 (\u0398 \u2297A \u0398) \u2295 * * * \u2295 (\u0398 \u2297A * * * \u2297A \u0398) \u2295 * * *\n\n.\n\nThen \u0393 is homologically smooth over R by [16, 3.7]. For N \u2265 0, we denote\nL\nby \u0393>N the ideal n>N \u0398\u2297A n of \u0393 and put \u0393\u2264N = \u0393/\u0393>N . Then Dper(R) (\u0393)\nis contained in per(\u0393) and \u0393\u2264N lies in Dper(R) (\u0393) for all N \u2208 N. We consider\nthe category C(\u0393) = per(\u0393)/Dper(R) (\u0393) and compute its morphism spaces.\nWe have a functor ?\u2297L\nA \u0393 : per(A) \u2192 C(\u0393) and a restriction functor per(\u0393) \u2192\nD(A) induced by the natural embedding of A into \u0393. For any Y \u2208 per(\u0393)\nand any N \u2208 N, let F N (Y ) = Y \u2297A \u0398\u2297A N and let mN : F N (Y ) \u2192 Y be\ninduced by the multiplication.\nWe assume that for any X \u2208 Dper(R) (A) there is an n \u2208 N such that\nHomD(A) (F n (A), X) vanishes.\nLemma 3.1. For Y in per(\u0393), we have the following isomorphisms\ncolimN HomD(\u0393) (\u0393>N , Y ) \u223c\n= HomC(\u0393) (\u0393, Y )\n\u223c\n= colimN HomD(A) (F N +1 (A), Y |A ).\nProof. By definition, the space HomC(\u0393) (\u0393, Y ) is given by\ncolimM\u0393 HomD(\u0393) (\u0393\u2032 , Y ) ,\nwhere M\u0393 denotes the category of all morphisms s : \u0393\u2032 \u2192 \u0393 in D(\u0393) such\nthat cone(s) lies in Dper R (\u0393). We consider the exact sequence\n0\n\n/ \u0393>N\n\neN\n\n/\u0393\n\n/ \u0393\u2264N\n\n/ 0.\n\nAs \u0393\u2264N vanishes in C(\u0393), the embedding eN is an isomorphism for any N in\nN. The transition maps in the direct system are induced by the embedding\nof \u0393>N +1 into \u0393>N and the maps from HomD(\u0393) (\u0393>N , Y ) to HomC(\u0393) (\u0393, Y )\nby composing with the inverse of eN .\nBy a classical result of Verdier, it is sufficient to show that for every\nmorphism s in M\u0393 , there is an N \u2208 N such that eN factors through s. It\nis therefore sufficient to show that for every Y \u2208 Dper(R) (\u0393) there is an\nN \u2208 N such that the space HomD(\u0393) (\u0393>N , Y ) vanishes.

Since we have colimN l\u2208N HomD(A) (F N (L), F l (Y0 )) =\nHomC orb (L, Y0 ), the functor ? \u2297L\nA \u0393 induces a fully faithful embedding of\nthe orbit category into C(\u0393).

Since A is cofibrant over R, every complex\nthat is cofibrant over A or Ae is also cofibrant over R.

The commutativity of the middle square follows from the diagram in the proof of\n3.3.\n\u0003\n4. The integral cluster category\nLet Q be a finite quiver without oriented cycles. An RQ-lattice is a\nfinitely generated RQ-module which is free over R. We denote by D(RQ) the\nderived category of RQ-modules. We denote by \u0393 the Ginzburg dg algebra\n\n\f8\n\nBERNHARD KELLER AND SARAH SCHEROTZKE\n\n[10] associated to (Q, 0) and by D(\u0393) the derived category of differential\ngraded \u0393-modules. We refer to [18, 2.12] for an introduction to the Ginzburg\nalgebra and its derived category. The integral cluster category is defined as\nthe triangle quotient\nCRQ = per(\u0393)/Dper(R) (\u0393).\nIn analogy with [3], we define C orb to be the orbit category of per(RQ) by\nthe auto-equivalence SR \u03a3\u22122 .\nTheorem 4.1. The functor ? \u2297L\nRQ \u0393 induces a fully faithful embedding of\norb\nC\ninto CRQ . The category CRQ is the triangulated hull of C orb .\nProof. Let \u0398 = \u03a3\u22122 RHomRQe (RQ, RQe ) \u223c\n= \u03a3\u22122 HomR (RQ, R). The tensor\nL\n\u22122\nfunctor ? \u2297A \u0398 induces the functor SR \u03a3 and restricts to an equivalence of\nper(RQ) by 2.2 . By [16, 6.3], the tensor algebra TA (\u0398) is quasi-isomorphic\nto the Ginzburg algebra \u0393. Now Theorem 3.3 yields the statement.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.2. The category D(\u0393) satisfies the relative 3-Calabi-Yau\nproperty, i.e. for Y \u2208 D(\u0393) and X \u2208 Dper R (\u0393), there is a bifunctorial\nisomorphism\nRHomR (RHomD(\u0393) (X, Y ), R) \u223c\n= RHomD(\u0393) (Y, \u03a33 X)\nfor any Y \u2208 D(\u0393) and X \u2208 Dper R (\u0393).\nProof. By [16, 4.8], the dg module \u03a9 = RHom\u0393e (\u0393, \u0393e ) is isomorphic to\n\u03a3\u22123 \u0393 in D(\u0393e ). Now using Lemma 2.1 we obtain the required isomorphism\nby the same proof as in [16, 4.8].\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.3. Suppose that the ring R is hereditary. Let L be an object\nin D(\u0393) and let Z be an object in the subcategory Dper R (\u0393). Then we have\nHomR (HomD(\u0393) (Z, L), R)\u2295Ext1 (HomD(\u0393) (Z, \u03a3\u22121 L), R) \u223c\n= HomD(\u0393) (L, \u03a33 Z).\nProof. As R is hereditary, every object X in D(R) is isomorphic to the\nL\nsum of its shifted homologies n\u2208Z \u03a3\u2212n H n (X). As H n RHomD(\u0393) (Z, L) =\nL\nHomD(\u0393) (Z, \u03a3n L), we have RHomD(\u0393) (Z, L) \u223c\n= n\u2208Z \u03a3\u2212n HomD(\u0393) (Z, \u03a3n L).\nTherefore RHomR (RHomD(\u0393) (Z, L), R) is isomorphic to\nY\n\u03a3n RHomR (HomD(\u0393) (Z, \u03a3n L), R).\nn\u2208N\n\nFurthermore, we have RHomR (M, R) \u223c\n= HomR (M, R) \u2295 \u03a3\u22121 Ext1R (M, R) for\nany R-module M . Therefore, the homology of RHomR (RHomD(\u0393) (Z, L), R)\nin degree zero is given by\nHomR (HomD(\u0393) (Z, L), R) \u2295 Ext1 (HomD(\u0393) (Z, \u03a3\u22121 L), R).\nWe obtain the statement by comparing the homology in degree zero in 4.2\nand using the fact that the homology of RHomD(\u0393) (L, \u03a33 Z) in degree zero\nis given by HomD(\u0393) (L, \u03a33 Z).\n\u0003\n\n\fTHE INTEGRAL CLUSTER CATEGORY\n\n9\n\n5. rigid objects\nWe assume from now on that R is a hereditary ring. Our goal in this\nsection is to show that, if R is a principal ideal domain, each rigid object of\nthe integral cluster category is either the image of a rigid indecomposable\nRQ-module or the suspension of the image of an indecomposable projective\nRQ-module. We also show that the orbit category C orb and the integral\ncluster category are equivalent, so that the orbit category is triangulated.\nBy [7, Theorem 1] all rigid indecomposable RQ-modules are lattices and\nthere is a bijection between the rigid indecomposable lattices and the real\nSchur roots of the quiver Q given by the rank vector. Following [1], we\ndefine the fundamental domain to be the R-linear subcategory\nF = D\u22640 \u2229 \u22a5D\u2264\u22122 \u2229 per(\u0393)\nof per(\u0393), where \u22a5D\u2264n denotes the full subcategory whose objects are the\nX \u2208 D(\u0393) such that HomD(\u0393) (X, Y ) vanishes for all Y \u2208 D\u2264n . Let \u03c0 :\nper(\u0393) \u2192 CRQ be the canonical triangle functor.\nTheorem 5.1. For every object Z of CRQ , there is an N \u2208 Z and an object\nY \u2208 F[N ] such that \u03c0(Y ) is isomorphic to Z.\nProof. For every object X \u2208 per(\u0393), there is an N \u2208 Z and an M \u2208 Z\nsuch that X \u2208 D\u2264N and X \u2208 \u22a5D\u2264M . This follows from the facts that\n\u0393 \u2208 D\u22640 (\u0393) \u2229 \u22a5D\u2264\u22121 (\u0393) and that the property is stable under taking shifts,\nextensions and direct factors. So let X \u2208 \u22a5D\u2264N \u22122 for some N \u2208 Z. Consider\nthe canonical triangle\n\u03c4\u2264N (X) \u2192 X \u2192 \u03c4>N (X) \u2192 \u03a3\u03c4\u2264N (X).\nAs \u03c4>N (X) \u2208 Dper(R) (\u0393) and \u03c0 is a triangle functor, the objects \u03c0(\u03c4\u2264N (X))\nand \u03c0(X) are isomorphic. It remains to show that \u03c4\u2264N (X) \u2208 \u22a5D\u2264N \u22122 ,\nwhich is equivalent to the fact that \u03a3\u22121 \u03c4>N (X) lies in \u22a5D\u2264N \u22122 . By 4.3, for\neach object L of D(\u0393), the sum\nHomR (HomD(\u0393) (\u03a3\u22121 \u03c4>N (X), L), R)\u2295Ext1R (HomD(\u0393) (\u03a3\u22121 \u03c4>N (X), \u03a3\u22121 L), R)\nis isomorphic to HomD(\u0393) (L, \u03a32 \u03c4>N (X)). This group vanishes for all L \u2208\nD\u2264N \u22122 . We fix an object L in D\u2264N \u22122 . The R-module\nH = HomD(\u0393) (\u03a3\u22121 \u03c4>N (X), L)\nis left orthogonal to R and so has to be a torsion module. Since \u03a3L also lies\nin D\u2264N \u22122 , the group Ext1R (H, R) vanishes and so we have H = 0. Therefore,\nthe object \u03c4\u2264N (X) lies in F[N ] and its image is isomorphic to the image of\nX in the integral cluster category.\n\u0003\nFollowing [1], we define an add(\u0393)-resolution of an object M \u2208 per(\u0393) to\nbe a triangle\nP0 \u2192 P1 \u2192 M \u2192 \u03a3P0\n\n\f10\n\nBERNHARD KELLER AND SARAH SCHEROTZKE\n\nwith P0 , P1 in add(\u0393).\nLemma 5.2. An object X \u2208 per(\u0393) has an add(\u0393)-resolution if and only if\nX lies in F.\nProof. If X lies in F, then X has an add(\u0393)-resolution by the proof of [1,\n2.10]. Now let\nP1 \u2192 P0 \u2192 X \u2192 \u03a3P0\nbe an add(\u0393)-resolution. Applying the homology functor to this triangle,\nwe get a long exact sequence. Using the fact that \u0393 has non-zero homology\nonly in non-positive degree, we see that X lies in D\u22640 . Next we apply the\nfunctor HomD(\u0393) (?, Y ) to the add(\u0393)-resolution for any object Y \u2208 D\u2264\u22122 .\nThen we obtain a long exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Hom(\u03a3P0 , Y ) \u2192 Hom(X, Y ) \u2192 Hom(P0 , Y ) \u2192 Hom(P1 , Y ) \u2192 * * *\n\n.\n\nAll terms in this sequence have to vanish and therefore X belongs to \u22a5D\u2264\u22122 .\n\u0003\nWe have\nHomCRQ (\u0393, \u0393) \u223c\n= RQ\n= HomC orb (RQ, RQ) \u223c\n= HomC orb (RQ, RQ) \u223c\nby 4.1. Therefore we have a functor G = HomCRQ (\u0393, ?) from CRQ to the\ncategory of RQ-modules. Note that G vanishes on \u03a3\u0393, hence G factors\nthrough the quotient category CRQ / add(\u03a3\u0393).\n\u03b1 /\nExample 5.3. We consider the quiver Q : 1\n2 and R = Z.

Let\nM \u2032 be the image of M in per(\u0393). We have G(M \u2032 ) \u223c\n= M but M \u2032 does not lie\nin the fundamental domain as HomD(RQ) (M, \u03a32 P1 ) is isomorphic to Z /2 Z.\nBut clearly M \u2032 belongs to \u22a5D\u2264\u22123 (\u0393), hence by the proof of 5.1, we have that\n\u03c4\u2264\u22121 (M \u2032 ) \u223c\n= M \u2032 in CZ Q and \u03a3\u22121 \u03c4\u2264\u22121 (M \u2032 ) \u2208 F.\nLemma 5.4. Let M be an object in CRQ . Then G(GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393) and GM\nL\nare isomorphic in CRQ . If GM is a lattice, then G(GM \u2297RQ \u0393) viewed as\nan element of per(\u0393) lies in the fundamental domain.\nProof. We have\nL\nG(GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393) = HomCRQ (\u0393, GM \u2297RQ \u0393)\n\u223c\n= Hom orb (RQ, GM )\nC\n\n\u223c\n= HomRQ (RQ, GM ) \u223c\n= GM,\n\n\fTHE INTEGRAL CLUSTER CATEGORY\n\n11\n\nas the embedding of C orb into CRQ is fully faithful by 4.1. Let now GM be\nL\n\u223c\na lattice. Then GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393 is in D\u22640 . We have Hom\u0393 (GM \u2297RQ \u0393, Y ) =\nHomper(RQ) (GM, R Hom\u0393 (\u0393, Y )). If Y \u2208 D\u2264\u22122 , then R Hom\u0393 (\u0393, Y ) also lies\nin D\u2264\u22122 . As GM is a lattice, we have that GM lies in \u22a5D\u2264\u22122 and hence\nHomper(RQ) (GM, R Hom\u0393 (\u0393, Y )) vanishes. This finishes the proof.\n\u0003\nDefinition 5.5. We call an indecomposable object X in CRQ lattice-like, if\nthere is a lattice L such that X is isomorphic to \u0393 \u2297L\nRQ L or X is isomorphic\nto \u03a3\u0393 \u2297L\nP\nfor\na\nprojective\nindecomposable\nRQ-module\nP.\nRQ\nAll lattice-like objects are images of objects in the orbit category C orb .\nTheorem 5.6. Let M be an indecomposable rigid object of CRQ . There is\n\u2212N \u0393.\nan N \u2208 Z such that M is isomorphic to G(\u03a3N M ) \u2297L\nRQ \u03a3\nProof. By 5.1, there is an N \u2208 Z and an object M \u2032 \u2208 F[N ] such that\n\u03c0(M \u2032 ) = M . We assume without loss of generality that N = 0. By\nLemma 5.2, each object of F admits an add(\u0393)-resolution. Therefore, for\nN \u2032 in F, we have, as in Proposition 2.1 c) of [17], the isomorphism\nHomCRQ / add(\u03a3\u0393) (\u03c0M \u2032 , \u03c0N \u2032 ) \u223c\n= HomRQ (GM, G\u03c0N \u2032 ).\nNote also that G(GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393) is isomorphic to GM by Lemma 5.4. Let\nh\n\n\u03a3\u22121 M \u2192 P1 \u2192 P0 \u2192 M\nbe an add(\u0393)-resolution in the integral cluster category. Then all morphisms\nfrom P1 to M factor through h. Applying G to the triangle gives the start\nof a projective resolution\nGP1 \u2192 GP0 \u2192 GM \u2192 0.\nAs P1 , P0 and M are all images of objects in F, we have that every morphism\nfrom GP1 to GM factors through Gh. Therefore GM is rigid as an RQmodule and hence is a lattice. If GM vanishes, then M lies in add(\u03a3\u0393).\nSince we have equivalences\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c\nadd(RQ) \u2192\nadd(\u0393) \u2192\nadd(\u03c0(\u0393)) \u2192\nadd(RQ) ,\n\nwe obtain M \u223c\n= G(\u03a3\u22121 M ) \u2297L\nRQ \u03a3\u0393. So let us suppose that GM does not\nvanish. As GM is a lattice, the object GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393 lies in F. It follows that\nthere are isomorphisms\nL\nf \u2208 HomCRQ / add(\u03a3\u0393) (M, GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393) and g \u2208 HomCRQ / add(\u03a3\u0393) (GM \u2297RQ \u0393, M ).\n\nWe lift f and g to morphisms f \u0303 and g\u0303 in the integral cluster category.

Since f g is an isomorphism of RQ-modules,\nf \u0303g\u0303 is an isomorphism in the integral cluster category. But M is indecomposable and f \u0303g\u0303 factors through M , hence the objects M and GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393 are\nisomorphic.\n\u0003\nNote that the proof of the previous theorem also holds if G(\u03a3N M ) is a\nnon vanishing lattice. Therefore we have\nLemma 5.7. Let M be an indecomposable object in CRQ such that there is\na Z \u2208 F with \u03c0(Z) is isomorphic to M . If GM is a non vanishing lattice,\nthen M is isomorphic to GM \u2297L\nRQ \u0393.\nThe next result is well-known for derived categories of hereditary algebras\nover fields.\nLemma 5.8. Let R be a principal ideal domain. The Serre functor SR of\nper(RQ) maps shifts of rigid lattices to shifts of rigid lattices.\nProof. The Serre functor is given by the left derived functor of tensoring\nwith the bimodule \u0398 = HomR (RQ, R). As F Q is hereditary, the Serre\nfunctor SF maps a non-projective module L to \u03a3\u03c4 L, where \u03c4 denotes the\nAuslander-Reiten translation of the category of F Q-modules. Hence the\nSerre functor applied to non projective indecomposable F Q-modules has\nnon-vanishing homology only in degree minus one. Moreover, the functor\nSF maps projective modules to injective modules.\nThe statement is clear for projective lattices of RQ. Let M be a nonprojective indecomposable rigid lattice over RQ and\nf\n\n0 \u2192 P1 \u2192 P0 \u2192 M \u2192 0\na projective resolution of M . Then P0 and P1 are lattices and f splits as a\nmap of R-modules. The object SR (M ) is isomorphic to the complex\nf \u2297\u0398\n\n* * * \u2192 0 \u2192 P1 \u2297RQ \u0398 \u2192 P0 \u2297RQ \u0398 \u2192 0 \u2192 * * *\nAs \u0398 is a lattice, so are P0 \u2297RQ \u0398 and P1 \u2297RQ \u0398. The cokernel of f \u2297 \u0398\nis given by M \u2297RQ \u0398. We show next that f \u2297 \u0398 is surjective by proving\nthat M \u2297RQ \u0398 vanishes. By the proof of 3.5, SR commutes with the functor\n\u2212 \u2297L\nR F. Therefore (F \u2297R \u0398) \u2297F Q (M \u2297R F) and (\u0398 \u2297RQ M ) \u2297R F are isomorphic. By [7, Theorem 2] the module M \u2297R F is a rigid indecomposable\nnon-vanishing lattice which is non-projective. Suppose that M \u2297RQ \u0398 does\nnot vanish. Then there is a field F such that (\u0398\u2297RQ M )\u2297R F does not vanish.\nHence SF (F \u2297R M ) has non-vanishing cohomology in degree zero, which is a\ncontradiction, as F \u2297R M is a non-projective F Q-module. Therefore f \u2297 \u0398\nis surjective. Its kernel has to be a lattice as it is a submodule of a lattice.\nThe object SR (M ) is isomorphic to the one-shift of this lattice.\n\u0003\n\n\fTHE INTEGRAL CLUSTER CATEGORY\n\n13\n\nNext we analyze the relationship between the integral cluster category\nand the cluster category over the field F. We can strengthen [15, A.8].\nTheorem 5.9. Let R be a principal ideal domain. (1) The rigid indecomposable objects of CRQ are lattice-like.\n(2) The reduction functor\n? \u2297R F : CRQ \u2192 CF Q\ninduces a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of rigid indecomposable objects in CRQ to the set of isomorphism classes of rigid indecomposable\nobjects of CF Q .\nProof. We denote by FR the functor SR \u03a3\u22122 in per(RQ) and by F the functor\nS\u03a3\u22122 in per(F Q). Let M \u2208 CRQ be a rigid indecomposable object. By 5.6\nand 4.1, we can view M as an object of C orb and M is isomorphic to the\nN -shift of the image of a rigid RQ-lattice M \u2032 . Then M \u2297L\nR F is isomorphic\nto the N -shift of the rigid module M \u2032 \u2297R F seen as an object in CF Q . If\nwe view \u03a3N M \u2032 \u2297L\nR F as an object in per(F Q), we see that there is a rigid\nindecomposable module L in mod F Q or an indecomposable direct summand\nP of F Q such that \u03a3N M \u2032 \u2297R F and L lie in the same F -orbit or \u03a3N M \u2032 \u2297L\nRF\nn \u03a3\u2212N M \u2032 \u2297 F\nand \u03a3P lie in the same F -orbit. Let n \u2208 Z be such that L \u223c\nF\n=\nR\nor \u03a3P \u223c\n= F n \u03a3\u2212N M \u2032 \u2297R F.\nAs SR maps the shift of a rigid lattice to the shift of a rigid lattice by\n5.8, we have that FRn \u03a3N M \u2032 is also the k-shift of a rigid RQ-lattice, say L\u2032\nin per(RQ) for some k \u2208 Z. By 3.5, we have that \u03a3k L\u2032 \u2297 F and L are\nisomorphic or \u03a3k L\u2032 \u2297R F \u223c\n= \u03a3P in per(F Q), hence k vanishes in the first\ncase and k equals one in the second case. Furthermore, in the second case L\u2032\nis isomorphic to a projective RQ-module. We obtain therefore that \u03a3N M \u2032\nis in the FR -orbit of L\u2032 in the first case and is in the FR -orbit of \u03a3L\u2032 in the\nsecond case. Hence in the orbit category, we have that M is isomorphic to\na lattice or to the one-shift of a projective lattice. This finishes the proof of\nthe first statement. Using Theorem 1 of [7] we then immediately obtain the\nsecond statement.\n\u0003\nNote also that all rigid objects satisfy the unique decomposition property,\nas they are lattice-like and the statement holds by [7, Theorem 2] for rigid\nlattices in the category of RQ-modules.\nWe can also show that the orbit category C orb and the integral cluster\ncategory coincide and hence the orbit category is triangulated.\nTheorem 5.10. The embedding of the orbit category C orb into CRQ is an\nequivalence. Therefore the orbit category C orb is canonically triangulated.\n\n\f14\n\nBERNHARD KELLER AND SARAH SCHEROTZKE\n\nProof. We consider the commutative diagram of functors\nper(RQ)\n\n?\u2297L\nRQ \u0393\n\n/ per(\u0393)\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nC orb\n\n?\u2297L\nRQ \u0393\n\n\u000f\n/ CRQ .\n\nBy 3.3, the bottom functor is fully faithful. Let us show that it is essentially\nsurjective. Let M \u2208 CRQ . By 5.1, there is an n \u2208 Z and an M \u2032 \u2208 F such that\n\u03a3n \u03c0M \u2032 \u223c\n= M . We assume without loss of generality that n = 0 and chose\nh\nan add(\u0393)-resolution P1 \u2192 P0 \u2192 M \u2032 \u2192 \u03a3P1 . By remark 3.4, the restriction\nof \u03c0 to add(\u0393) is fully faithful and so is the restriction of per(RQ) \u2192 per(\u0393)\nto add(RQ). Thus, the morphism h : P1 \u2192 P0 is the image of a morphism\n\u2032\nin per(RQ). Since \u2212 \u2297L\nRQ \u0393 : per(RQ) \u2192 per(\u0393) is a triangle functor, M is\nalso isomorphic to an image of an object in per RQ. By the commutativity\nof the diagram, we deduce that M , as an object in CRQ , is isomorphic to\nthe image of an object in C orb . Now the objects in CRQ are identical with\norb \u2192 C\nthe objects in per(\u0393), hence ? \u2297L\nRQ is essentially surjective\nRQ \u0393 : C\nand hence an equivalence.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.11. The integral cluster category satisfies the relative 2-CalabiYau property, i.e. X and Y \u2208 CRQ , there is a bifunctorial isomorphism\nRHomR (RHomCRQ (X, Y ), R) \u223c\n= RHomCRQ (Y, \u03a32 X)\nin D(R).\n6. Cluster-tilting mutation\nMutations of cluster-tilting objects have been defined for cluster categories\nover fields in [3], generalizing the mutations of tilting objects in hereditary\ncategories studied in [11]. The mutation of rigid objects and cluster-tilting\nobjects in the cluster category is used in [6] to give an additive categorification of the cluster algebra associated to the quiver Q and its exchange\nrelations. We refer to [2] [13] [15] [20] for overviews.\nUsing our classification of rigid objects in the integral cluster category,\nwe can generalize the results obtained in [3]. Throughout this section, we\nassume that R is a principal ideal domain and we fix a ring homomorphism\nfrom R to a field F. Let Q be a finite quiver without oriented cycles and let\nn be the number of its vertices.\nDefinition 6.1. A cluster-tilting object T is a rigid object in CRQ such that\nT has n indecomposable direct summands which are pairwise non-isomorphic.\nLet T \u2032 be another cluster-tilting object. The pair (T, T \u2032 ) is called a mutation\npair if T and T \u2032 have exactly n \u2212 1 isomorphic indecomposable summands\n\n\fTHE INTEGRAL CLUSTER CATEGORY\n\n15\n\nin common. Then we say that T \u2032 is connected to T by a cluster-tilting\nmutation.\nBy Theorem 5.9 the results of [3], every rigid indecomposable object appears as a direct summand of a cluster-tilting object. Moreover, the functor\n? \u2297R F induces a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of clustertilting objects of CRQ onto that of CF Q and this bijection preserves mutation\npairs.\nLemma 6.2. If X and Y are rigid objects in CRQ , then Ext1CRQ (X, Y ) is\na free R-module and ? \u2297R F induces a bijection between Ext1CRQ (X, Y ) and\nExt1CF Q (F \u2297R X, F \u2297R Y ).\nProof. Let first X and Y be two rigid RQ lattices. By [7, Theorem 1],\nthe R-module Ext1RQ (X, Y ) is free. By applying 5.11 we obtain that the\nR-module Ext1CRQ (X, Y ) is isomorphic to\nExt1RQ (X, Y ) \u2295 HomR (Ext1RQ (Y, X), R),\nand hence is free. If we apply F \u2297R ?, we obtain, again by [7, Theorem 1],\nthat it is isomorphic to\nExt1F Q (F \u2297R X, F \u2297R Y ) \u2295 HomF Q (Ext1F Q (F \u2297R Y, F \u2297R X), F),\n\u223c \u03a3P for some projective RQwhich is isomorphic to Ext1CF Q (X, Y ). If Y =\n1\nmodule P , then ExtCRQ (X \u2297R F, Y \u2297R F) is isomorphic to HomRQ (X, P )\nwhich is also a free R-module by [7, Theorem 1]. The rest of the proof is\nanalogous.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.3 (Cluster tilting mutation). Let T be a cluster tilting object\nof CRQ and X an indecomposable direct summand of T with complement\nX \u2032 . Let Y be an indecomposable rigid object. Then T \u2032 := Y \u2295 X \u2032 is a\ncluster-tilting object if and only if Ext1CRQ (X, Y ) has rank one.\nProof. By 6.2 we have Ext1CRQ (X, Y ) \u2297R F \u223c\n= Ext1CF Q (X \u2297R F, Y \u2297R F).\nFurthermore both objects F \u2297R X and F \u2297R Y are rigid and indecomposable.\nClearly F \u2297R T \u223c\n= F \u2297R X \u2295 F \u2297X \u2032 is a cluster tilting object in CF Q . Thus,\nby [3, 7.5], the object F \u2297R T \u2032 is cluster tilting if and only if the extension\ngroup Ext1CF Q (X \u2297R F, Y \u2297R F) is one dimensional. As the functor F \u2297R ?\ninduces a bijection between rigid indecomposable objects in CRQ and CF Q ,\nthe object T \u2032 is cluster-tilting if and only if Ext1CRQ (X, Y ) has rank one. \u0003\nLet X and Y be rigid indecomposable objects with an extension space\nof rank one. By the preceding theorem and the results of [3], we obtain\nthat there is a rigid object X \u2032 such that Y \u2295 X \u2032 and X \u2295 X \u2032 are clustertilting objects. Let us choose generators \u03b5 and \u03b5\u2032 of the rank one modules\nExt1CRQ (X, Y ) and Ext1CRQ (Y, X). We construct non split triangles\nf\n\n\u03b5\n\ng\n\n\u03b5\u2032\n\nY \u2192 E \u2192 X \u2192 \u03a3Y and X \u2192 E \u2032 \u2192 Y \u2192 \u03a3X.\n\n\f16\n\nBERNHARD KELLER AND SARAH SCHEROTZKE\n\nBy Lemma 6.2 these triangles are mapped by the functor F \u2297R ? to nonsplit triangles in CF Q . By [3, 6.4] the maps F \u2297R f and F \u2297R g are minimal\nadd(F \u2297R X \u2032 )-approximations. We call the triangles in the integral cluster\ncategory the exchange triangles of the mutation. By [6] they categorify the\nexchange relations in the cluster algebra associated to the quiver Q.\nIt was shown in [3] [11], cf. also [12], that all cluster-tilting objects of\nCF Q are related by iterated mutation. Clearly, as cluster-tilting objects and\ntheir mutations in CRQ are in bijection with cluster-tilting objects in CF Q\nand their mutations, we obtain the following result.\nCorollary 6.4. The cluster tilting objects in CRQ are all connected via\ncluster-tilting mutation and can therefore be obtained by iterated mutation\nfrom the initial object \u0393.\nReferences\n[1] Claire Amiot, Cluster categories for algebras of global dimension 2 and quivers with\npotential, Annales de l'institut Fourier 59 (2009), no. 6, 2525\u20132590.\n[2] Aslak Bakke Buan and Robert Marsh, Cluster-tilting theory, Trends in representation\ntheory of algebras and related topics, Contemp.
