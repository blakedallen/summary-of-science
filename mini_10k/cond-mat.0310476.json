Our model combines a single-configuration interaction picture with the SchwingerKeldysh non-equilibrium Greens function approach to compute the current response of a molecular\nsemi-conducting wire following excitation. We give detailed analysis of the essential excitonic,\ncharge-transfer, and dipole states for poly-(phenylenevinylene) chains of length 32 and 48 repeat\nunits under an electric field bias and use this to develop a reduced dimensional tunneling model\nwhich accounts for chain-length and field-dependent behavior.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAdvances in nanotechnology have lead to the fabrication of the devices which length-scales smaller than\nthe mean free path of an electron.2 Work in this direction as pushed the scale of an individual \"device\"\nto the molecular scale through reported measurements\nof electronic transport through carbon nanotubes, selfassembled monolayers of conjugated polymers, and indivisual molecules. 1 Moreover, there have been recent\nmeasurements of electrically induced light emission from\nindividual single-walled carbon nanotubes3 , as well as incredible progress towards the fabrication and synthesis of\ndirect-bandgap nanowires and super-lattices with novel\noptical-electronic properties.\nAs this technology continues to press towards the\nmolecular level, energy quantization, phase coherences,\nand electron-phonon coupling play increasingly important roles in the properties of the device. The central theme and challenge in designing molecular electronic components is the manipulation and control of\ncharge flow through single molecules and molecular assemblages. Predicting and understanding electronic current flow through molecular systems from an atomistic\nand first principles point of view presents a formidable\ntheoretical challenge in that in requires the extension\nof standard quantum chemical methods that are well\nsuited for bound state problems to solve non-stationary\nand many-body scattering in the continuum. The difficulty arises in how to impose open boundary conditions\nand steady flow-boundary conditions in a computationally feasible way.\nBy in large, the theoretical description of charge transport in a molecular device can be cast in the language\nof quantum scattering theory in both time dependent\nand time-independent forms. The physical picture is\nthat given by Landauer2,5 in which current through a\n\nmolecular wire is generated by ballistic charge carriers\nscattering through the molecule. Hence, conductivity is\nrelated to the transition matrix matrix, T . For the timeindependent case, the formal treatment involves the use\nof non-equilibrium Keldysh-Green function treatments\nto compute the T -matrix.4,6,7 Within the \"scattering\"\napproach, one derives a self-energy contribution to the\nmolecular Hamiltonian due to the contact with the leads\nattached to the wire. This leads to a non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian with complex eigenvalues. In contrast to the\nLandauer approach, Kosov9,10,11 establishes a molecular\nwire as a non-equilibrium steady-state system by appending a Lagrange multiplier to the molecular Hamiltonian\nto constrain the current passing through the system to\nbe some desired value. As a consequence, the modified\nHamiltonian remains Hermitian, continuity is rigorously\nenforced, and the bias is determined as the difference between the Fermi energies of the system under forward\nand reverse current.\n\nIn this work, we focus upon electronic transport\nthrough semiconducting systems where Coulomb interaction and electron correlation effects become important.\nWe address the issue of current due to photoexcitation\nof a conjugated polymer \"wire\". We focus on the case\nwhere the bias applied to the semiconductor is insufficient to produce current so that all of the charge-carriers\nin the system are due to the photo-excitation process.\nWe adopt the Newn-Anderson20,21 model for a two bandsemiconducting polymer wire and use this description to\ncompute the current response of the wire.\n\n\f2\nmer Hamilton is given by17,18,19\nX\nHP =\n(Fmn + Vmn )|mihn|\n\n(2)\n\nnm\n\nFIG. 1: Scheme of the one-particle description and definition\nof injection energy with respect to the band-center.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODEL\n\nMetal-Polymer-Metal Hamiltonian\n\nWe consider here a rather idealized scenario in which\nan N -site polymer chain bridging two metal electrodes.\nThis is idealized in the generic sense because in the majority of photo-current experiments, the polymer chromophores in the sample are either randomly distributed\nin the sample or have more or less random orientation\nwith respect to the applied bias field. Moreover, with the\nexception of experiments on single molecules or molecules\noriented on a surface, the molecules themselves are not\nchemically bound to the electrodes. Nonetheless, we\nrecognize these as possible limitations of our theoretical model. The formalism we give here is adapted from\nthe typical single-particle perspective for the case of electron/hole interactions. By assuming that the coupling\nto the continuum is a single-particle interaction, we can\nadopt a general scattering-theory perspective to describe\ncurrent producing state in the presence of electron/hole\nexcitations.\nTo begin, we partition the state space of our system\ninto three domains, QL\u03b1 and QR\u03b1 which span the states\nof the left and right electrodes and P which spans the\nelectronic states of the bridging molecule and be projected into separate Fock spaces representing different\ntotal numbers of elementary electron/hole excitations.\nP = P0 + P1 + P2 + * * *\nThus, the full Hamiltonian has the structure\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nHL\u03b1 VP L 0\nH = \uf8ed VP L HP VP R \uf8f8\n0 VP R HL\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the diagonal terms are the hamiltonians for the\nuncoupled subsystems and VP L and VP R are the interactions between the polymer and the left and right electrodes. We will assume that number of excitations within\nthe total system is conserved so that VP L and VP R cannot couple different polymer Fock spaces and are thus\nsingle particle (electron or hole) operators.\nThus, within the space of single excitations, the poly-\n\nwhere |mi = |me mh i is mono-excited electron/hole configuration, Vmn is the two-particle matrix-element, and\nFmn is the matrix of the one-particle band-structure operator, f\u02c6 (which also includes any external field bias). In\nthe absence of the electrodes, this is given by\nFmn = \u03b4mh nh hme |f\u02c6|ne i \u2212 \u03b4me ne hmh |f\u02c6|nh i\n\n(3)\n\nWhen the coupling to the electrodes is introduced, these\nterms need to be modified to include the one-particle\npolymer-electrode coupling. For this we need to make a\nnumber of assumptions regarding the form of this coupling. First, we assume that the polymer-electrode coupling occurs only at the terminal sites of the polymer.\nVLP = \u03b7kme mh (|kih1e mh | + |kihme 1h |).\n\n(4)\n\n2,12,15\n\nUsing the Feshbach method\nand assuming that the\ndensity of states of the electrodes is that of a 3D metal,\nwe can derive reduced one-particle matrix elements, F\u0303\nfor the terminal sites of the polymer.\nF\u030311 = F11 \u2212 \u03a31 (E)\n\n(5)\n\nF\u0303N N = FN N \u2212 \u03a3N (E)\n\n(6)\n\nwith the remaining terms left unmodified. \u03a3R\nK (E) =\n\u2206K (E) \u2212 i\u039bK (E) is the complex (retarded) self-energy\nR \u2217\ncontribution from the electrodes. (Note: \u03a3A\nK = (\u03a3K )\nis the advanced self-energy.) For these, we adopt the\nNewns-Anderson20,21 model and write\n\uf8f1 E\n|E/2\u03b3| < 1\n\uf8f4\n2\u03b3 , r\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\uf8f4\n2\nE\n\u03b22 \uf8f2 E +\n\u2212 1, E/2\u03b3 < 1 (7)\n2\u03b3\n2\u03b3\n\u039bK (E) = K\nr\n\u03b3 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nE\n\uf8f3 E \u2212\n\u2212 1, E/2\u03b3 > 1\n2\u03b3\n2\u03b3\n\uf8f1r\n\u0010 \u00112\n2 \uf8f2\nE\n\u03b2K\n|E/2\u03b3| < 1\n1\n\u2212\n2\u03b3\n(8)\n\u2206K (E) =\n\u03b3 \uf8f3\n0,\notherwise.\nwhere E is the \"injection energy\" for an electron (or hole)\nto tunnel between the metal and the polymer measured\nrelative to a common Fermi energy, EF , 4\u03b3 is the bandwidth of the metal reservoir, and \u03b2K is the chemisorption\ncoupling between the polymer and electrode. This system is illustrated in Fig. 1. For a metal/polymer contact,\nwe take 4\u03b3 = 40 eV as the band-width of the electrode\nand with a chemisorption coupling of \u03b2K = 0.5eV. For\nthe unbiased case, the injection energy for an electron or\na hole is half the band-gap of the polymer, E = 2.5eV for\nPPV so that both the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals\nof the \u03c0-electron system fall into the band-width of the\nmetal. Thus, |E/2\u03b3| < 1 and we can approximate the\nretarded self energy as\n\u03a3R\nK (E) \u2248 \u2212i\n\n2\n\u03b2K\n\u03b3\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nwhich indicates that the coupling to the electrode should\nproduce only a minor perturbation to the real energy of\nthe system and that its only effect is to provide a sink for\nthe e/h excitation to decay. We will also assume throughout that the applied bias is insufficient to cause direct\ncurrent flow through the system. The Newns-Anderson\nmodel was also used by Mujica et al.13,14 for the description of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) current in\nmolecular imaging of one-dimensional systems to encompass the more general process of electron transfer between two reservoirs.\nOur primary assumption throughout is that the selfenergy contribution is a single-particle term.

The density of states for a\n32-repeat unit model of PPV under 0.03eV/unit bias is\nshown in Fig. 2\nIn Fig. 3 we compare the distribution of the real and\nimaginary components of the singlet SCI states for a PPV\npolymer chain of 48 and 32 repeat units with a bias potential of 0.03eV/unit cell. This corresponds to a macroscopic field of 1.0 \u00d7 105 V /cm which is on-par with the\nfields placed across actual devices. The shading of each\npoint in the figure reflects the net charge on the terminal\nends of the molecule with white or red circles indicating no net charge on the terminal site. Also indicated\non this plot are a set of energies we will associate with\nthe lowest exciton (XT), the lowest energy pure charge\ntransfer state where the electron and hole do not reside\non the same repeat unit (CT) , and a \"dipole\" state (D)\nin which the electron and hole are localized on opposite\nends of the chain.\nWe see that the energies of the lowest energy excitonic\nstate are identical for both chains at 2.5eV as is the location of lowest pure charge-transfer state at about 2.9eV.\nBoth of these sets of states are indicated by circles on\nFig. 3. What is interesting in this regard is that there\nappears to be a progression of purely excitonic states intersecting a progression of charge-separated states. This\nprogression of excitonic states are simply the center-ofmass translational eigenstates of the lowest energy bound\nelectron/hole state. Even though the exciton states acquire quite large (in comparison) imaginary energy components indicating that the life-time of the states steadily\ndecrease as energy increases, they remain relatively unpolarized by the applied field. As we shall demonstrate\n\nFIG. 3: (color) Complex energy distribution for the SCI\nstates of P P V32 (colored disks) and P P V48 (gray-disks) under\n0.03eV/unit bias. Note the imaginary energy component \u03bb is\nscaled by 103 . The shading or hue for each point indicates\nthe degree of polarization of each state as measured by the\nnet charge on the terminal end of the chain with open circles\nindicating no net charge on the terminal site (red for P P V32 ).\nThe six circled energies correspond to the lowest energy dipole\nstate (D), exciton (XT), and charge transfer (CT) state for\neither chain.\n\nnext, the current produced by a given excitation is determined by both the size of the imaginary energy components and by the net charge on the terminal ends of the\nmolecule. Consequently, the excitonic states will contribute very little to the current where as the chargetransfer states will give the dominant contribution.\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the XT, D, and first two CT states\nfor the 32 unit chain. Here, the exciton is more or less\nunperturbed by the applied field and is more or less identical to the exciton for the polymer in the absence of the\nfield. For the dipole state (D), the electron and hole are\nlocalized on the opposite ends of the polymer. For the\n32 unit chain, E(D) > E(XT ); however, for the 48-unit\nchain the dipole state is considerably lower in energy than\nthe XT. The energy of this state should scale almost linearly with chain size since to lowest order approximation\nE(D) = qna as per a dipole in an electric field. The CT\nstates shown in Fig. 4 are tunneling states from a bound\nCT state (i.e. the mAg) into the continuum. In fact\nthis entire picture can be rationalized in a simple onedimensional model of the unimolecular decay of a bound\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 4: Electron/hole distributions for the XT, D, and two\nCT states for P P V32 at 0.03eV/unit bias.

The total electron/hole potential is indicated by the\nthick line and the corresponding exciton, dipole, and chargetransfer states are superimposed. The shaded \"wall\" corresponds to the end of the polymer connected to the continuum.\nAs the length of the polymer increases, the D state moves farther to the right and lower in energy whereas the XT and CT\nremain more or less unchanged.\n\nCurrent response to an excitation\n\nIf we consider the net flow of charge from the molecule\nfollowing promotion to some state \u03c6\u03b1 , we need to be\ncognizant of the fact that even though the lifetime of the\nstate is given by 2\u03bb\u03b1 /h\u0304, this represents only the net decay\nof the electron/hole excitation from the molecule into the\nmetal since there is an equal influx and efflux of charge\nto and from the molecule. In other words, the current\nproduced by a given state is not simply proportional to\nthe rate of decay of the state into the continuum. Furthermore, in the limit that the valance and conduction\nbands have identical interaction with the metal (as in the\ncase at hand) no net charging of the molecule can occur\nas a result of contact with the metal. Hence, total charge\nQ on the molecule must remain a constant of the motion.\nSince I = Q\u0307, one is tempted to conclude I = 0. However,\nthe net current should be taken as the difference between\nits retarded and advanced components.\nR\n\nA\n\nR\n\nA\n\nI = (Q\u0307 \u2212 Q\u0307 ) = i[\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3 , Q]/h\u0304\n= e[\u0393, Q]/h\u0304\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nThus, the current produced at a given excitation energy\nE is given by\nI(E) = Tr([\u0393, Q])/h\u0304\n+\n+\n\u2212\ne 1 X \u03bb2a ((e\u2212\nLa \u2212 hLa ) + (hRa \u2212 eRa ))\n=\n(28)\nh\u0304 2\u03c0 a\n(E \u2212 \u03b5a + \u03b4\u01eba )2 + (\u03bba /2)2\nFor the case of electron/hole symmetry, we have the\nadditional requirement\n+\n+\n\u2212\ne\u2212\nL\u03b1 \u2212 hL\u03b1 = hR\u03b1 \u2212 eR\u03b1 .\n\n(29)\n\nThus, we can consider the current produced by a given\nstate by writing\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\u0012\nh+ on site 1\ne\u2212 on site 1\n\u2212\nI\u03b1 = (2e\u03bb\u03b1 /h\u0304)\n\u2212\nhole anywhere\n\n=\n\n(2e\u03bb\u03b1 /h\u0304)(e\u2212\nL\u03b1\n\n\u2212\n\nh+\nL\u03b1 )\n\ne\n\nanywhere\n\n(30)\n\nThis is similar to the notion by Halpern that current\ncarrying states are localized at the opposite ends of the\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 6: Current vs. excitation energy and spectral response\nfor P P V48 at 0.03eV/unit bias. Here we show both the natural line-widths of the current resulting from a single chain\nand the inhomogeneously broadened current response. In this\ncase, the effect of the field is to shift the lowest current producing state below the lowest energy exciton so that current\nis produced without any excess photon energy above the state\noptically coupled to the ground state.\n\nconducting sample23 since these are the states with the\nmost interaction with the terminal leads. For purely excitonic states, the net charge on the terminal sites will be\nexactly zero. Hence a purely excitonic species will produce no net current. However, a charge-transfer species\nwill produce current when the system is placed under a\nbias. Reversing the bias produces current in the opposite direction since the current producing charge-transfer\nstates will be polarized in the reverse direction.\nIn Fig.6 we show the current response for a given excitation energy as well as the optical response for P P V48\nunder 0.03eV/unit bias. From the way we have defined\nthe direction of the current, a negative response indicates\ncurrent in the forward direction, i.e. electrons flowing\nfrom the \u2212 to + ends and holes flowing + to \u2212. A zero\nresponse indicates that the electron current exactly balances the hole current, so no net charge flows through the\nsystem as a result of excitation. At roughly 5.5 eV (center\nof the single-excitation band) the current response passes\nthrough zero and we see current going against the direction of the bias field as the energy increases. Since this\nis well above the optical response of the system which\npeaks at about 2.5 eV, this reverse current most likely\nwould not be observed in any molecular system.\n\nC.\n\nEffect of Bias Field\n\nFinally we turn our attention towards what happens\nto the induced current as a function of applied field. In\nFig. 7 we show the current response for a 32-unit chain\n\nFIG. 7: Current vs. excitation energy for P P V32 in two different applied fields (0.01eV/unit and 0.03 eV/unit). Here\nwe have included a 100\u00d7\u03bb\u03b1 inhomogeneous line broadening\nto each state to mimic the effects of environmental disorder.\n\nunder 0.01 eV/unit and 0.03eV/unit bias and the corresponding complex CI energies in Fig. 8. First we note\nthat the on-set of current shifts towards higher energies\nupon going from 0.03eV/unit to 0.01 eV/unit. This is\ncommensurate with the fact that as the field decreases,\nthere is proportionally less Stark shifting of the dipole\nstates. Consequently, at low field we have fewer potential current producing states at lower energies compared\nto the higher field case. On the other hand, the XT\nstates remain completely unperturbed by the change in\nfield. At lower field, the lowest CT states have smaller\nimaginary energies than at high-field. Again, this is consistent with our reduced one dimensional model in Fig. 5 :\nlower-fields produce less tunneling between the CT states\nand the continuum.\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have laid a theoretical ground-work\nfor the study of current producing states in molecular\nsemiconductors focusing solely up current produced upon\nelectronic excitation. In a subsequent works, we will address the issue of DC and AC conductivity in molecular semiconductors, especially those in which half of the\nmolecule is more electron rich than the other. Such model\npn-junctions have been produced synthetically24,25 and\nwe have recently studied the electro-luminescence of such\nsystems.26\nNeedless to say, there are several lacuna in our treatment that will need to be systematically addressed. First,\nwe assume that the electric field across the molecule is\nuniform. In realistic systems, this may not be the case\nand one really should self-consistently solve the Poisson equation for the field taking into account the actual\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 8: Real and imaginary SCI energies for P P V32 in two\ndifferent applied fields.

Secondly, we do not currently\naccount for lattice excitations or distortions due to the\napplied field or the current through the system. The current response as we have defined it, simply gives the coherent ballistic current produced at some energy E above\nthe HF ground state. We are currently working to extend\nthis to finite temperature by the inclusion of phonon creation and annihilation channels.\nIn spite of these shortcomings, the basic physical picture offered by this model is quite appealing. First of all,\nit emphasizes the fact that different electron/hole states\nhave widely differing capacities for producing current following a given excitation. Possessing a large imaginary\nenergy alone is insufficient to produce current. The state\nmust also be sufficiently polarized so that there is adequate charge separation. This raises another crucial aspect in trying to use this model to understand photocurrent in bulk systems. That is, states with large dipole\nmoments will be poorly coupled to the ground state via\noptical excitation. Consequently, direct excitation from\nthe ground state to a strongly current producing state\nis highly unlikely. What is more likely is that following\nphoto-excitation to some higher-lying eigenstate, phonon\ncreation kicks in and induces transitions between the initial state and lower energy electronic states including\nthose capable of producing current.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFunds for this work were provided by the National Science Foundation (CAREER Award) and by the Robert\nA.
