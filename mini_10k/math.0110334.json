We define complexes analogous to Goncharov's complexes for the\nK\u2013theory of discrete valuation rings of characteristic zero.

In case the ring is the localization of the\nring of integers in a number field, there are no assumptions necessary. We compute the composition of our map to the K\u2013theory with the syntomic regulator.\nThe result can be described in terms of a p\u2013adic polylogarithm. Finally, we\napply our theory in order to compute the regulator to syntomic cohomology\non Beilinson's cyclotomic elements. The result is again given by the p\u2013adic\npolylogarithm. This last result is related to one by Somekawa and generalizes\nwork by Gros.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet K be a complete discrete valuation field of characteristic zero, R its valuation\nring, and \u03ba its residue field. Assume \u03ba has positive characteristic p and is algebraic\nover Fp . If X/R is smooth, separated and of finite type, there is a regulator map\nfrom K-theory to syntomic cohomology\n2j\u2212n\nKn(j) (X) \u2192 Hsyn\n(X, j) ,\n\nsee [Bes00a]. In many interesting cases the target group of the regulator is isomor2j\u2212n\u22121\n(X\u03ba /K),\nphic to the rigid cohomology group, in the sense of Berthelot, Hrig\nwhere X\u03ba is the special fiber of X. We will be most interested in the situation\n(n)\nwhere X = Spec(R), and the K\u2013group is K2n\u22121 (R) for n \u2265 2. The target group\n0\nfor the regulator in this case is Hrig\n(Spec(\u03ba)/K) \u223c\n= K (see Definition 4.6 for the\nprecise identification). Because \u03ba is algebraic over Fp , Kn (\u03ba) is torsion for all n \u2265 1,\nso from the long exact localization sequence\n(j\u22121)\n\n* * * \u2192 Kn(j\u22121) (\u03ba) \u2192 Kn(j) (R) \u2192 Kn(j) (K) \u2192 Kn\u22121 (\u03ba) \u2192 * * *\n(n)\n(n)\nwe get an isomorphism K2n\u22121 (R) \u223c\n= K2n\u22121 (K) for n \u2265 2. Hence we get a regulator\nmap (for n \u2265 2)\n(n)\n(n)\nreg : K2n\u22121 (K) \u223c\n= K2n\u22121 (R) \u2192 K .\n\nIn this paper we try to explicitly compute this regulator map. We note that if F\nis a number field with an embedding F \u2192 K, we can combine the natural map\n(n)\n(n)\nK2n\u22121 (F ) \u2192 K2n\u22121 (K) with this regulator map to obtain a regulator map on\n(n)\nK2n\u22121 (F ). Also, for a number field F , all Kn (F ) are torsion if n is even and\n(n)\npositive. For the odd ones, all K2n\u22121 (F ) \u2297Z Q are K2n\u22121 (F ), so the computation\n(n)\nfor K2n\u22121 (K) is the most interesting from the point of view of number fields.

Under\nsuitable assumptions about weights in K\u2013theory (as formulated in the Beilinson\u2013\nSoul\u00e9 conjecture, see Definition 3.2), there is a map\n(1.1)\n\nf\u2022 (K)) \u2192 K (n) (K) .\nH r (M\n(n)\n2n\u2212r\n\nf\u2022 (R) for the ring R, whose\nIn Section 3, we construct analogous complexes M\n(n)\ncohomology (again under suitable assumptions) maps directly to the K\u2013theory of\nR, and in Section 7 we compute the regulator map on its image. In the cases we\nf\u2022 (R) can be identified with the subcomplex of the complex for\nare interested in M\n(n)\nK spanned in degree k + 1 = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 by all [u]n\u2212k \u2297 v1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 vk with v1 , . . . , vk\nin R\u2217 , u in R\u2217 such that 1 \u2212 u is also in R\u2217 , and in degree n by all v1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 vn with\nall vi in R\u2217 . (A u in R\u2217 such that 1 \u2212 u is also in R\u2217 is called a special unit.) But\nredoing the construction has the advantage that we can work over R all the time,\nwhich is required for the computation of the regulator.\nThe case that the field is a number field deserves special mentioning. First of all,\nno assumptions about weights are necessary in this case. Furthermore, it is known\nf\u2022 (F )) \u2192 K (n) (F ) is an isomorphism\nthat if F is a number field, the map H 1 (M\n2n\u22121\n(n)\nfor n = 2 and n = 3, as well as when F is a cyclotomic field for all n \u2265 2. (There is\nalso substantial numerical evidence that it should be an isomorphism for all n for\nnumber fields, which is part of a conjecture by Zagier, as well as a corresponding\nconjecture for infinite fields by Goncharov.) Therefore one would have a complete\ndescription of the syntomic regulator for our discrete valuation ring R if we knew\nf\u2022 (R)) in K (n) (R) would be everything. This may not\nthat the image of H 1 (M\n2n\u22121\n(n)\nbe the case, as perhaps R does not have enough special units. One can try to\nf\u2022 (F )) as\novercome this difficulty by rewriting elements in the image of H 1 (M\n(n)\n1 f\u2022\n\u2032\n\u2032\nbeing part of the image of H (M (R )) where F /F is a finite field extension,\n(n)\n\nR\u2032 the corresponding ring in F \u2032 . We do this in the case of cyclotomic fields, so\nthat we obtain a full description of the syntomic regulator in this case. We also\nstate a Conjecture that the formulas found for the regulator on the complex for R\ngeneralize to be the regulator on the complex for F .\nIn order to present our results, we shall need the following functions. Let log :\nC\u2217p \u2192 Cp be a branch of the p\u2013adic logarithm. This means we define log on the\nelements z with |1 \u2212 z| < 1 by the usual power series, and we extend this to\nC\u2217p by choosing \u03c0 \u2208 Cp with |\u03c0| < 1, declaring log(\u03c0) = 0, and extending to a\nhomomorphism from C\u2217p to Cp (see Definition 2.1). Note that the values on the\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n3\n\nelements in C\u2217p with |z| = 1 is independent of the choice of \u03c0, but log and the\nfunctions Lin (z) about to be described depend on this choice. For the relation, see\nProposition 2.6.\nLet Li1 (z) = \u2212 log(1\u2212z) for z 6= 0 or 1. We follow Coleman to recursively define,\nusing his integration theory, functions Lin (z) for n \u2265 2. The defining relations are\ndLin (z) = Lin\u22121 (z) dlog z and limz\u21920 Lin (z) = 0, and they have a unique solution\nin the class of functions defined by Coleman. It is shown in [Col82] that those\nfunctions are locally analytic\nP\u221e in the naive topology on Cp , and are given by a\nconvergent power series k=1 z k /k n on the open unit disc in Cp . The function\nLin (z) extends to a locally analytic function on Cp \\ {1} with Lin (z) = 0 for n \u2265 1.\nThese functions satisfy the functional equation\nLin (z) + (\u22121)n Lin (1/z) =\n\n(1.2)\n\n\u22121\nlogn (z) ,\nn!\n\nsee Proposition 6.4 of [Col82]. We also introduce the function Ln , defined as\n(1.3)\n\nLn (z) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)m\nLin\u2212m (z) logm (z) .\nm!\nm=0\n\nIn order to state the Theorems below easily, we shall need linear combinations\nof these functions. Namely, we want a suitable combination that satisfies a clean\nfunctional equation for z and 1/z. It follows from (1.2) that Lk (z)+(\u22121)k Lk (1/z) =\n(\u22121)k\nk\nk! log (z). Therefore the function\nLmod,n (z) =\n\nn\nX\n\nam Lm (z) logn\u2212m (z)\n\nm=1\n\nwith an = 1 satisfies\n(1.4)\n\nLmod,n (z) + (\u22121)n Lmod,n (1/z) = 0\n\nm\nP\nif nm=1 am (\u22121)\n= 0. Below, Lmod,n will mean any of those choices. For n = 2,\nm!\nthere is a unique such function, namely\n\nL2 (z) +\n\n1\n1\nlog(z)L1 (z) = Li2 (z) \u2212 log(z)Li1 (z) ,\n2\n2\n\nwhich is studied in Section VI and beyond in [Col82], where it is called D(z).\nIt is easily deduced from Coleman's theory (see Remark 2.3) that Lin is Galois\nequivariant. In particular, if K \u2282 Cp is a complete subfield, then Lin , and as a result\nalso Ln and Lmod,n , send K to K provided log was defined such that log(\u03c0) = 0\nwith \u03c0 \u2208 K.\nRemark 1.5. By considering the coefficients of the terms Lim (z) logn\u2212m (z) in the\nfunctions above, one sees that the functions Lm (z) logn\u2212m (z) for m = 1, . . . , n and\nLmod,m (z) logn\u2212m (z) as above for m = 1, . . . , n span the same Cp \u2013vector space\n(or even Q\u2013vector space in case all ai 's are in Q), namely the space spanned by\nLim (z) logn\u2212m (z) for m = 1, . . . , n. Therefore one can consider any function of the\nPn\u22121\nform j=0 bj Lin\u2212j (z) logj (z) with all bj in Cp as a candidate for Lmod,n , provided\nPn\u22121 bj\n= 0.

Because it is known that the elements [\u03b6]n for n \u2265 2 where \u03b6 runs\n(n)\nthrough the primitive m\u2013th roots of unity generate K2n\u22121 (Q(\u03bcm )), this gives a\ncomplete description of the syntomic regulator for cyclotomic fields. Note also that\nthis particular result extends the results of [Gro94], where the corresponding result\nwas proved only for roots of unity of order m with (m, p) = 1 (see Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2.22),\nand is equivalent to the results of [Som99]. That paper has a different formulation,\nwith another version of a syntomic regulator and also using a specialized version\nof the polylogarithm at roots of unity. The relation with Coleman's polylogarithm\nwas proved by Barsky (unpublished). The result of Gros is that the element [\u03b6]n is\n(p)\n(p)\nmapped under the syntomic regulator to Lin (\u03b6), where Lin is defined by\n1\nLin(p) (z) = Lin (z) \u2212 n Lin (z p ) .\np\nP\n(p)\nNote that the expansion of Lin at 0 is (k,p)=1 z k /k n . The difference between\nthe results is caused by the different normalizations of the regulators. One has the\nrelation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nFrob\nreg ,\nregGros = 1 \u2212 n\np\nwhere Frob is the Frobenius automorphism (The Gros regulator is only defined for\nunramified fields.) From Galois equivariance it follows that\nFrob(Lin (\u03b6)) = Lin (Frob(\u03b6)) = Lin (\u03b6 p ) .\nThe relation between the two results is therefore clear.\nWe now state the following Conjecture.\nConjecture 1.14. Let K \u2282 Cp be a discrete valuation subfield (i.e., the valuation\nis induced from the one on Cp ). Let R be the valuation ring of K.

(Please note that in the Appendix A K will have a different\nmeaning, whereas R will not.)\n2. Some preliminary material\nWe begin with recalling Coleman's integration theory in the form and to the\nextent that it will be needed for this work. References for the theory are [Col82]\nand [CdS88]. There is also a short summary in [Bes00b].\nOur basic data is a \"basic wide open\" in the sense of Coleman. The data defining such an object consist of a complete curve C/Cp , which is defined over some\ndiscretely valued subfield and which has good reduction C (the reader may take P1\nfor C since this is the only case that will be used in this paper), together with a\nfinite nonempty set of points S \u2282 C(Fp ) where Fp is the algebraic closure of Fp .\nTo every point y \u2208 C(Fp ) corresponds a \"residue disc\" Uy , a subspace of the rigid\nanalytic space associated with C, consisting of all points in C whose reduction is\ny. The basic wide open U = U\u03bb associated with the data above is a rigid analytic\nspace obtained from C by \"removing discs of radius \u03bb < 1 from the insides of the\nresidue discs Uy for y \u2208 S\". Technically this means that if the point y is locally\ndefined by the equation z\u0304 = 0, with z = zy some local parameter near y, then one\nremoves the points in Uy where |z| \u2264 \u03bb. This procedure depends on the choice of\nz but becomes independent of this choice as \u03bb approaches 1. We will not fix \u03bb but\nthink of it as approaching 1 and will take it as large as needed. From now on we\nwill use Uy to denote the residue disc of y in U , which is the intersection of the\nresidue disc with U . This is the same as before unless y \u2208 S in which case Uy is an\nannulus given by the equation \u03bb < |zy | < 1. Our final basic datum is a Frobenius\nendomorphism. This is a rigid analytic map \u03c6 : U\u03bb1 \u2192 U\u03bb2 , for some \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 ,\nwhose reduction \u03c6\u0304 is some power of the Frobenius endomorphism of some model of\nC over a finite field, extended Fp linearly. A good example of such a morphism is\n\u03c6(z) = z q on P1 for some power q of p.\nThe goal of Coleman's theory is to integrate certain differential forms on U . This\nis first done locally, on each residue disc Uy . If y \u2208\n/ S this residue disc is isomorphic\nto the open disc {|z| < 1}.\na\nrigid\ndifferential\nform\non such a disc has a convergent\nP\npower series expansion n\u22650 z n dz and integration is done term by term. When\ny \u2208 S the form dzy /zy is also analytic on Uy and so there is no choice but to\nintroduce a logarithm\nDefinition 2.1. Let \u03c0 \u2208 C\u2217p be such that |\u03c0| < 1. The branch of the p-adic\nlogarithm determined by \u03c0 is the unique function log = log\u03c0 : C\u00d7\np \u2192 Cp which\nis multiplicative, defined by the usual power series when |z \u2212 1| < 1 and satisfies\nlog(\u03c0) = 0.\nWe fix once and for all a branch of the logarithm. Then the integral of dzy /zy\ncan be taken to be log(zy ) and that allows integration of an arbitrary form on any\nUy .\nLet A(U ) (respectively \u03a91 (U )) be the ring of rigid analytic functions (respectively\none forms) on U and let Aloc (U ) (resp. \u03a91loc (U )) be the ring of Cp -valued functions\n(resp. module of one forms) on U which are in A(Uy ) (resp. \u03a91 (Uy )) for each\ny\u2208\n/ S and are in the polynomial ring A(Uy )[log zy ] (resp. in A(Uy )[log zy ]dzy ) when\ny \u2208 S. It is implicit in this definition that it is independent of the choice of the local\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n9\n\nparameter zy , a fact which follows because for any two choices of zy the difference\nbetween the log(zy ) is in A(Uy ).\nEach \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91loc (U ) can be integrated in Aloc (U ) in many ways, because we can\nchoose a different constant of integration for each Uy . Coleman's theory finds\na subclass of forms for which one can assign canonically an integral in Aloc (U )\ndefined up to a global constant. This is done recursively as follows. First one finds\nintegrals toP\nall forms \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 (U ). At each stage one integrates all forms that can be\nwritten as\nfi \u03c9i where fi are integrals which have been found in previous stages\nand \u03c9i \u2208 \u03a91 (U ). The rules for finding the integrals are:\n1. The integral is additive.\nR\n2. When g \u2208 A(U\n), Rdg = g + C, for some constant C.\nR\n3. We have \u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 = \u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 + C.\nThe fact that these rules suffice to carry out the integration process uniquely\nand that it is independent of the choice of \u03c6 is the main result of Coleman (see\n[Col82] and [CdS88]). One other result about Coleman integration that will be used\nis the following.\nProposition 2.2. Let f \u2208 A(U )\u2217 . Then the Coleman integral of the form df /f is\nlog(f ).\nProof. See [CdS88, Lemma 2.5.1].\nThe original reason that Coleman integrals were introduced is probably to give\na p\u2013adic analogue of complex iterated integrals. Let \u03c91 , \u03c92 , . . . , \u03c9r be forms in\n\u03a91 (U ) and let x \u2208 U . Then we can define an iterated integral\nZ z\n\u03c91 \u25e6 \u03c92 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03c9r\nfr (z) =\nx\nR\nby defining\nR f1 (z) = \u03c91 normalized so that f1 (x) = 0 and then by induction\nfk (z) = fk\u22121 \u03c9k again normalized so that fk (x) = 0.\nThe definition of p\u2013adic polylogarithms is a slight modification of the above.\nHere we take \u03c91 = \u2212 dlog(1 \u2212 z) and \u03c9i = dlog z for i > 1. Notice that dlog z has a\nsimple pole at 0. However, if we normalize fi at each step to vanish at 0 this zero\nwill cancel with the pole and we will obtain a form which is also integrable at the\nresidue disc of 0. This gives the definition of the introduction.\nRemark 2.3. If U is a wide open defined over a field L, containing at least one\nL-rational point x and suppose we have chosen the branch log\u03c0 such that \u03c0 \u2208 L.\nThen, if one has forms \u03c91 , . . . ,R\u03c9r which are all defined over L again, then an\niterated Coleman integral f = \u03c9\nR 1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03c9r , where the constants are fixed so\nthat all the intermediate integrals \u03c91 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03c9k take an L\u2013rational value at x are\nGalois equivariant in the sense that for every automorphism \u03c3 of Cp over L we have\nfor every z \u2208 U that f (z \u03c3 ) = (f (z))\u03c3 . In particular, if z is defined over L then\nf (z) \u2208 L. For Lin , since the forms are either dlog z or dlog(1 \u2212 z), which are all\ndefined over Qp , this means that if we take a branch log\u03c0 , with \u03c0 \u2208 Qp , then Lin\nis Galois equivariant over Qp .\nWe now want to collect some facts about the functions Lin and other things here\nthat we need in the rest of the paper.\nWe begin with recalling some results from [Col82].

Using\nz\u2208L\n\nthis limit as the value for Lin at 1, Lin extends to a function on Cp , which is\ncontinuous on finitely ramified extensions of Qp .\nIf m and n are integers at least equal to 2, then on Cp\nX\nLin (z m ) = mn\u22121\n(2.4)\nLin (\u03b6z) .\n\u03b6 m =1\n\nClearly the same formula holds for n = 1 provided 1 \u2212 z m 6= 0.\nLet loga and logb be two different branches of the logarithm. Denote the corresponding different branches of Lin by Lin,a and Lin,b . Let \u03b2 = loga p \u2212 logb p, and\nlet v be the valuation such that v(p) = 1. Note that\n(2.5)\n\nloga (z) \u2212 logb (z) = v(z)\u03b2 .\n\nProposition 2.6. We have\n(2.7) Lin,a (z) \u2212 Lin,b (z) =\n\u0001\n1\n\u2212 v(1 \u2212 z)\u03b2 logan\u22121 z + logan\u22122 z logb z + * * * + loga z logbn\u22122 z + logbn\u22121 z .\nn!\n\nProof. We first remark that by the construction of Coleman integrals the polylogarithm depends on the branch of the log chosen only on residue discs where one\nof the forms involved in the definition, i.e., dz/z and dz/(z \u2212 1), has a pole. This\nmeans that Lin,a and Lin,b can differ at most on the residue discs of 0, 1 and \u221e, and\nin fact only on the latter two discs because Lin (z) is analytic on |z| < 1. We note\nthat apriori it would seem that because the constant of integration is determined\nby the value at 0 the function could depend on the branch of the log everywhere,\nbut this is not the case exactly because logs do not appear in Lin at the residue\ndisc of 0. Because v(1 \u2212 z) 6= 0 only on the residue discs of 1 and \u221e the formula is\nproved except in the cases |z| > 1 and |z \u2212 1| < 1. Suppose |z| > 1. Using (1.2) we\nobtain\nLin,a (z) \u2212 Lin,b (z)\n1\n= (\u22121)n (Lin,b (1/z) \u2212 Lin,a (1/z)) \u2212 (logna z \u2212 lognb z)\nn!\n1\n= \u2212 (logna z \u2212 lognb z)\nn!\n1\n= \u2212 (loga z \u2212 logb z)(logan\u22121 z + logan\u22122 z logb z + * * * + logbn\u22121 (z))\nn!\n1\n= \u2212 v(1 \u2212 z)\u03b2(logan\u22121 z + logan\u22122 z logb z + * * * + logbn\u22121 (z))\nn!\nbecause v(z) = v(1 \u2212 z) for such z. It remains to consider the case |z \u2212 1| < 1. Note\nthat here log(z) is independent of the branch so the formula to be proved reads\nLin,a (z) \u2212 Lin,b (z) = \u2212\n\n1\nv(1 \u2212 z)\u03b2 logn\u22121 z .\n(n \u2212 1)!\n\nWe prove this by induction on n. For n = 1 this follows immediately from (2.5).\nAssume n > 1. According to [Col82, Proposition 7.1], Lin,a (z) \u2212 Lin\u22121,a (z) log(z)\nextends to an analytic function on |1\u2212z| < 1. (Note that B(0, 1) should be replaced\nwith B(1, 1) everywhere in the formulation and the proof of loc. cit.). The result\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n11\n\nwill follow from the induction hypothesis if we show that\n\u03b3n (z) := (Lin,a (z) \u2212\n\n1\n1\nlog(z)Lin\u22121,a ) \u2212 (Lin,b (z) \u2212\nlog(z)Lin\u22121,b ) = 0 .\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n\nWhen we differentiate \u03b3n (z) we find\n1\n1\nd(Lin,a (z) \u2212\nlog(z)Lin\u22121,a ) \u2212 d(Lin,b (z) \u2212\nlog(z)Lin\u22121,b )\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\u0012\n1\n1\nLin\u22121,a (z) \u2212\nlog(z)Lin\u22122,a (z) dlog(z)\n=\n1\u2212\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n\u0012\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u2212\n1\u2212\nLin\u22121,b (z) \u2212\nlog(z)Lin\u22122,b (z) dlog(z)\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nn\u22122\n\u03b3n\u22121 (z) dlog(z) = 0\n=\nn\u22121\nby induction. So the \u03b3n (z) is a constant on |z \u2212 1| < 1, call it C, and we must show\nthat C = 0. But \u03b3n (z) satisfies the distribution relation corresponding to (2.4).\nFor |z \u2212 1| < 1 this relation now reads C = mn\u22121 * m * C, which shows C = 0 as\nrequired.\nProposition 2.8. Assume the Beilinson\u2013Soul\u00e9 conjecture holds for fields of characteristic zero. Let loga and logb denote two branches of the logarithm, and denote\nthe corresponding functions involving Li's by a subscript a or b.

Therefore the map from Mn (K)\nto Cp given by mapping [x]n to Lin (x) is well defined under our assumptions, and\nit suffices to show that it induces a map on H 1 (M\u2022(n) (K)) which is independent of\nthe branch of the logarithm. Proposition 2.6 shows that this is true, as the right\nhand side of equation 2.7 is zero on elements in H 1 (M\u2022(n) (K)), as this map factors\nthrough the map Mn (K) \u2192 Mn\u22121 (K) \u2297 KQ\u2217 \u2192 * * * \u2192 (KQ\u2217 )\u2297n above, which maps\n[x]n to (1 \u2212 x) \u2297 x \u2297 . . . \u2297 x.\nWe shall also need the distribution relation for elements in Mn (F ), as given\nin [dJ95, Proposition 6.1].\nProposition 2.10.

The main idea is the same as in [dJ95], but the\nfact that we will be working with a discrete valuation ring rather than a field gives\nrise to complications. In order to highlight the idea we start with a rather gentle\nexposition. For the proofs of the statements that are used in the construction, we\nrefer the reader to loc. cit., especially Sections 2.1 through 2.3, and 3. In loc. cit.\nmost of the work was done over Q, but in fact the proofs hold over our base O , a\ndiscrete valuation ring of characteristic zero, without any change. There is also a\nvery brief introduction to multi relative K\u2013theory in Appendix A.\nThe idea of the whole construction is the following. If B is a regular Noetherian\nscheme, then the pullback K\u2217 (B) \u2192 K\u2217 (A1B ) is an isomorphism. We shall be using\n(i)\nan Adams decomposition with respect to weights, Km (X)Q = \u2295i Km (X). The\nweight behaves naturally with respect to pullback, and under suitable hypotheses\nfor a closed embedding, there is a pushforward Gysin map with a shift in weights\ncorresponding to the codimension (see, e.g., [dJ95, Proposition 2.3]).\nLet XB = P1B \\ {t = 1} with t the standard affine coordinate on P1 . Write 1B\nfor the closed subset {t = 0, \u221e} in P1B . Then the relative exact sequence for the\ncouple (XB ; 1B ) gives us\n* * * \u2192 Kn+1 (XB ) \u2192 Kn+1 (\n\n1\nB)\n\n\u2192 Kn (XB ;\n\n1\nB)\n\n\u2192 Kn (XB ) \u2192 Kn (\n\n1\nB)\n\n\u2192 ***\n\nfor n \u2265 0. Because the map pullback Kn+1 (B) \u2192 Kn+1 (XB ) is an isomorphism,\ncombining it with the pullback Kn+1 (XB ) \u2192 Kn+1 ( 1B ) = Kn+1 (B)2 shows\nthat the map Kn+1 (XB ) \u2192 Kn+1 ( 1B ) corresponds to the diagonal embedding\nKn+1 (B) \u2192 Kn+1 (B)2 . As this holds for all n \u2265 0, we get that we have an isomorphism Kn (XB ; 1B ) \u223c\n= Kn+1 (B) for n \u2265 0. Note that we have a choice of sign\nhere in the isomorphism of the cokernel of Kn (B) \u2192 Kn (B)2 with Kn (B). This\n(n)\nresults in similar choices of signs in the maps H p (M\u2022(n) (O)) \u2192 K2n\u2212p (O) (resp.\nf\u2022 (O)) \u2192 K (n) (O)) later on in this Section.\nH p (M\n(n)\n\n2n\u2212p\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n13\n\nWe can iterate this procedure using multi relative K\u2013theory. (The construction\nof this is recalled in Appendix A.) For the sake of exposition we give the argument\nhere for the next level of relativity.

We shall explain the idea for m = 1. (For m \u2265 2 the localization\nsequences get replaced by a spectral sequence, see below.) If u is an element in our\ndiscrete valuation ring O such that both u and 1 \u2212 u are units, then we get an exact\nlocalization sequence\n* * * \u2192 Km (O) \u2192 Km (XO ;\n\n1\nO)\n\n1\nO)\n\n\u2192 Km (XO,loc ;\n\n\u2192 Km\u22121 (O) \u2192 * * *\n\nwhere XO,loc = XO \\ {t = u} and we identified {t = u} \u2282 XO with O (or rather\nSpec(O)). We used here that u and 1 \u2212 u are units in O so that {t = u} does\nnot meet 1O or {t = 1}, and that O is regular in order to identify Km (O) with\n\u2032\nKm\n(O). (If we want to leave out {t = u} and {t = v} simultaneously for two\ndistinct elements u and v in O such that all of u, v, 1 \u2212 u and 1 \u2212 v are units, which\nwe shall do below, this already becomes far more complicated and one is force to\nuse a spectral sequence.)

The reader is encouraged to compare this construction with\nthe simpler construction for fields, which is carried out in [dJ95, Section 3].\nTo ease the notation somewhat, we will drop the subscript (indicating the base\nscheme) from n .\nDefinition 3.2.

F has no low weights K\u2013theory if F is a number field, or more\ngenerally a subfield of the algebraic closure of Q.

We then have a map\nf\u2022 (O)) \u2192 K (n) (O),\nH r (M\n2n\u2212r\n(n)\n\nwhich is obtained as the composition of the maps\n(3.20)\n\n\u223c\n\u223c\n(n)\nr\nf\u2022 (O))\u2190H\n(M\u2022(n) (O))\u2190H r (Symb\u2022(n) (O)) \u2192 K2n\u2212r (O) .\nH r (M\n(n)\n\nFrom left to right, those maps are justified by Proposition 3.18 or Remark 3.19,\nProposition 3.15, and Lemma 3.4 as it implies that we are working in the lowest\nnonvanishing row of the spectral sequence (3.7).\nOne has the same maps when replacing O with F everywhere, and the inclusion\nof O into F induces an injection of complexes M\u2022(n) (O) into M\u2022(n) (F ) by Proposition 3.16, which is compatible with all those, maps, i.e., the diagram\n(3.21)\n\nf\u2022 (O)) o\nH r (M\n(n)\n\u000f\nf\u2022 (F )) o\nH r (M\n(n)\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nH r (M\u2022(n) (O))\n\n/ K (n) (O)\n2n\u2212r\n\n\u000f\nH r (M\u2022(n) (F ))\n\n\u000f\n/ K (n) (F )\n2n\u2212r\n\ncommutes. This shows that we can identify the complex M\u2022(n) (O) with a subcomplex of M\u2022(n) (F ).\nRemark 3.22. If the Beilinson\u2013Soul\u00e9 conjecture holds for fields of characteristic\nzero and for \u03ba, then one proves in the same way as in Proposition 3.16 that the map\nf\u2022 (O) \u2192 M\nf\u2022 (F ) is injective, so we can identify M\nf\u2022 (O) with a subcomplex\nM\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nf\u2022 (F ).\nof M\n(n)\n\nRemark 3.23. If F \u2032 /F is an arbitrary field extension, and O\u2032 \u2282 F \u2032 is a discrete valT\nf\u2022 (O\u2032 ),\nf\u2022 (O) \u2192 M\nuation ring with O \u2282 O\u2032 F , then there are obvious maps M\n(n)\n(n)\nand similarly for F and F \u2032 , as well as for the complexes M\u2022(n) . Because the map\n(r)\n\n(r)\n\nK2n\u2212r (F ) \u2192 K2n\u2212r (F \u2032 ) is always injective, the corresponding maps for the complexes of F to the ones for F \u2032 is injective, provided either the Beilinson\u2013Soul\u00e9\nconjecture is true in general for fields of characteristic zero, or F \u2032 is algebraic over\nQ. This is proved like in the proof of Proposition 3.16, as the assumptions mean\n(n)\nthat the necessary maps to K2n\u22121 (F ) etc. exist and are injective. Similarly, if the\n(n)\n(n)\nmap K2n\u22121 (O) \u2192 K2n\u22121 (O\u2032 ) is injective, we get the corresponding statement for\nthe complexes for O and O\u2032 provided the Beilinson\u2013Soul\u00e9 conjecture holds for F \u2032\nand \u03ba\u2032 (and hence for F and \u03ba). In particular, all those maps are injective either\nif the Beilinson\u2013Soul\u00e9 conjecture is true for fields of characteristic zero, or F \u2032 is\nalgebraic over Q. If this is the case, we shall always view all complexes as being\nsubcomplexes of the corresponding complexes of F \u2032 , and view all K\u2013groups as being\ncontained in the corresponding K\u2013groups of F \u2032 .\nRemark 3.24. We make a few remarks about the above construction without\nassuming the Beilinson\u2013Soul\u00e9 conjecture. There are two places where it plays a\nrole, namely the vanishing of the spectral sequence (3.7) below the row starting\n(n)\nn\u22121\n\u2022\nwith Kn (XO,loc\n; n\u22121 ), and the acyclicity of the subcomplex N(n)\n.\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n21\n\n(1)\n\nAs for the first case, it is well known that Kn (O) = 0 for n \u2265 2. Therefore the\nlast two columns (which would correspond to degrees n and n+1 for our complexes)\nof the spectral sequence below our main row are always zero. This means that the\n(n)\nmaps H r (M\u2022(n) (O)) \u2192 K2n\u2212r (O) always exists for r = n \u2212 1 and r = n. As for\nthe second case, it follows from the proof of [dJ95, Proposition 3.20] that the map\n(1)\nN2 (K) \u2192 Sym2 (KQ\u2217 ) given by mapping [x]2 to x \u2297 x is an injection as K2 (L)\n(1)\n\n\u2022\nand K3 (L) are zero for any field L. Therefore the complex N(n)\n(F ) is acyclic in\ndegrees n \u2212 1 and n. Because we have the exact sequence\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nK3 (\u03ba) \u2192 K3 (O) \u2192 K3 (F )\nand the first term is zero, we see as in Proposition 3.16 that Symb2 (O) \u2286 Symb2 (K),\n\u2022\nf2 (O) \u2286\nM2 (O) \u2286 M2 (K), that N(n)\n(R) is acyclic in degrees n\u22121 and n and hence M\nf2 (K). We also get a commutative diagram\nM\nf\u2022 (O)) o\nH r (M\n(n)\n\u000f\nf\u2022 (F )) o\nH r (M\n(n)\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nH r (M\u2022(n) (O))\n\n/ K (n) (O)\n2n\u2212r\n\n\u000f\nH r (M\u2022(n) (F ))\n\n\u000f\n/ K (n) (F )\n2n\u2212r\n\nfor r = n \u2212 1 and r = n without any assumptions.\n4. Syntomic regulators\nIn this Section we briefly recall some parts of the theory of rigid syntomic regulators, originally due in the affine case to Gros [Gro94], as described in detail\nin [Bes00a]. Our goal is to describe the theory in the minimal details required to\nunderstand constructions to follow and to develop certain computational tools that\nare needed in later Sections.\nRecall that R is a complete discrete valuation ring with quotient field K of characteristic 0 and residue field \u03ba of characteristic p. We will assume that \u03ba is algebraic\nover the prime field since this is required for some of the versions of syntomic cohomology we will be using. All schemes will be separated and of finite type over their\nrespective bases. We describe as little as we need of the general theory, sending\nthe interested reader to [Bes00a]. All versions of syntomic cohomology are defined\nas cohomologies of certain huge complexes. These are needed for the definition of\nthe regulators but are useless when it comes to calculations. The cohomology can,\nhowever, be realized, using some auxiliary data, as the cohomology of very explicit\ncomplexes, and maps on cohomology can similarly be realized explicitly. The theory developed in loc. cit. guarantees that these explicit maps are indeed the correct\nmaps and we avoid explicit mentioning of that in the sequel.\nFor the purpose of this work, the version best suited for computations is the\nGros style modified syntomic cohomology denoted by H\u0303ms in [Bes00a]. This is the\nweakest version of syntomic cohomology and all other versions, in particular Hsyn\nhave natural maps to it [Bes00a, Proposition 9.5] which, by definition, are compatible with Chern classes in algebraic K-theory. Fortunately, according to [Bes00a,\nProposition 8.6.3], when X/R is proper and 2n 6= i, i \u2212 1, i \u2212 2, the canonical map\ni\ni\n(X, n) \u2192 H\u0303ms\n(X, n) is an isomorphism. Therefore, for the purpose of detecting\nHsyn\nsyntomic regulators in the cohomology of Spec(R) working with H\u0303ms is just as good\n\n\f22\n\nAMNON BESSER AND ROB DE JEU\n\nas working with Hsyn . To further simplify matters, we only give the description of\nH\u0303ms given certain additional data that may not exist in general but do exist in our\nsituation.\nSuppose first that X is a scheme over a field \u03ba of characteristic p. Following\nBerthelot we define the rigid complex of X over K as follows: We choose an open\nj\nimmersion X \u2212\n\u2192 X into a proper \u03ba-scheme and a closed immersion X \u2192 P into a\np-adic formal R-scheme which is smooth in a neighborhood of X. We remark that\nin general there may be some difficulty doing this but in the cases we will consider\nit will be totally obvious how to do so.\nIn the above situation we can, following Berthelot, define the complex\nR\u0393rig (X/K)P := R\u0393(]X[P , j \u2020 \u03a9\u2022]X[ ) .\nHere, the notation ]X[P stands for the tube of X in P, which roughly means the\nspace of points in the rigid analytic space associated to P that reduce to a point in\nX. The functor j \u2020 of \"sections of overconvergent support\" goes from the category\nof abelian sheaves on ]X[P to itself and is defined by\nj \u2020 (F ) = lim\n\u2212\u2192(jU )\u2217 (F |U ) ,\nU\n\nwhere the direct limit is over all U which are strict neighborhoods of ]X[P in ]X[P\nin the sense of Berthelot and jU is the inclusion of U in ]X[P . We recall that U is a\nstrict neighborhood if {U, ]X[P \u2212 ]X[P } is an admissible cover of ]X[P in the sense\nof rigid analysis. We have indexed the complex for simplicity by P but we should\nremember the entire setup leading up to the definition. In any case, Berthelot\nshows that in the derived category of K-vector spaces this complex is independent\nof all choices, so its cohomology, Hrig (X/K), is entirely well defined. To simplify\nnotation we will drop the P subscript from the notation. In the applications it will\nbe clear which additional data is being used.\nWe will often need to let a (\u03ba-linear) Frobenius act on our complexes. To do that\nwe will consider a morphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 X which is a \u03ba-linear base change from a\nmodel of X defined over a finite field with q = pr elements of the r-th power of the\nabsolute Frobenius. We insist that \u03c6 preserves X. Such a \u03c6 is called a Frobenius\nendomorphism of X. We then assume that there is a lift \u03c6 of \u03c6 to P. We call q\nthe degree of \u03c6 and \u03c6. It is then clear that \u03c6 acts on the rigid complex.\nNext we describe the construction of the syntomic complexes. Here we assume\nthat X is a smooth R-scheme and that we have an open immersion X \u2192 X into\na proper R-scheme and a closed immersion X \u2192 P into a R-scheme, smooth in a\nneighborhood of X, and that there is a R-morphism \u03c6 : P \u2192 P inducing on the\nspecial fiber a Frobenius endomorphism. In this situation we can clearly embed\nX\u03ba into X \u03ba and this last scheme into the p-adic completion Pb of P to get to the\nsituation we had when we defined the rigid complex and \u03c6 will induce a lift of a\nFrobenius endomorphism.\nThe given data induces a filtration on the complex R\u0393rig (X\u03ba /K) defines as follows: let J be the sheaf of ideals defining the generic fiber X K inside ]X \u03ba [Pb and\nconsider the filtration of \u03a9\u2022]X [ given by the complexes\n\u03ba P\nb\n\nFJn \u03a9\u2022]X \u03ba [ := J n \u03a90 \u2192 J n\u22121 \u03a91 \u2192 * * * ,\nb\nP\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n23\n\nwhere it is understood that J r = O for non positive r.

We can now define the Gros style modified syntomic\ncomplex to be the complex\n\u2217\n\nn\n\n/q\nf ms (X, n) := Cone(F n R\u0393rig (X\u03ba /K) \u22121\u2212\u03c6\nR\u0393\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 R\u0393rig (X\u03ba /K))[\u22121] .\n\nThe map in the cone is a shorthand for the composition of the indicated map\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 /q n with the natural map of F n R\u0393rig (X\u03ba /K) into R\u0393rig (X\u03ba /K). To fix\nnotation for Cones we use the following sign convention here. If f : A\u2022 \u2192 B \u2022 , then\nCone(A\u2022 \u2192 B \u2022 )[\u22121] is given in degree i by\n(4.1)\n\nAi \u2295 B i\u22121 ,\n\nwith differential d(a, b) = (da, f (a) \u2212 db) .\n\nf ms (X, n) is independent of the additional data except for\nOne can show that R\u0393\nthe choice of the Frobenius endomorphism \u03c6. Here, in the general case one takes\na direct limit over all possible Frobenius endomorphisms as described in [Bes00a,\nDefinition 8.4]. When X = R all the connecting homomorphisms of the limit are\nquasi\u2013isomorphisms so we may in fact fix a single \u03c6.\nIn [Bes00a] syntomic regulators from the K-theory of X into the various versions of syntomic cohomology were constructed. For the cohomology theory we are\nconsidering these take the form of a map\n2i\u2212j\nci,j : Kj (X) \u2192 H\u0303ms\n(X, i) .\n\nIn this work we will need to consider similar maps in the relative and multi-relative\nsituations. These were not constructed in loc. cit. but are constructed in Appendix A.\nWe recall the computation of the regulator on a part of the K-theory of affine\nR-schemes. Suppose X = Spec(A) is such a scheme. We will give an explicit description of the rigid and syntomic cohomology of X. We can choose an embedding\nof X as an open subset in the projective P = X. Suppose X\u03ba is defined in X \u03ba by\nthe nonvanishing of the reductions of functions hi . Then for \u03bb < 1 we define a rigid\nspace U\u03bb by the conditions |hi | > \u03bb. The U\u03bb are strict neighborhoods of ]X\u03ba [Pb in\n]X \u03ba [Pb . It follows that there exists a map\n\u2022\nlim\n\u2212\u2192 \u0393(U\u03bb , \u03a9 ) \u2192 R\u0393rig (X\u03ba /K) .\n\n\u03bb<1\n\nProposition 4.2. This map is a quasi\u2013isomorphism. In addition, this quasi\u2013\nisomorphism is functorial with respect of maps of pairs (X, X).\nProof. The first statement follows from the proof of Proposition 1.10 in [Ber97].\nThe second statement is a consequence of the construction of the rigid complexes\nin [Bes00a].\nTo obtain the modified syntomic complex, suppose we have a map \u03c6 : X \u2192 X\nwhose reduction is a Frobenius endomorphism fixing X\u03ba . The ideal J considered\nabove is the 0 ideal in this case.

The normalization of this isomorphism is perhaps\nnot the obvious one and since the computation of the regulator depends on the\nparticular normalization, we describe this here at least in a special case (see [Bes00a]\nfor a fuller discussion). Suppose that X has relative dimension i\u22121 over R. Suppose\ni\nin the description above that (\u03c9, \u03b5) \u2208 H\u0303ms\n(X, n). We see that \u03c9 = 0 so d\u03b5 = 0.\ni\u22121\nThus \u03b5 defines a class in Hrig (X\u03ba /K) which is easily seen to be well defined up to\ni\u22121\nan element of (1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 /q n )F n Hrig\n(X\u03ba /K). When n \u2265 i > relative dimension of X,\nas will be the case for us, the map\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\n(4.5) (1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 /q n ) : Hrig\n(X\u03ba /K)/F n Hrig\n(X\u03ba /K)\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\n\u2192 Hrig\n(X\u03ba /K)/(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 /q n )F n Hrig\n(X\u03ba /K)\n\nis an isomorphism by [Bes00a, Proposition 8.6.3].\nDefinition 4.6. When n \u2265 i > relative dimension of X, we have a canonical\nisomorphism,\ni\u22121\ni\nH\u0303ms\n(X, n) \u223c\n(X\u03ba )/F n ,\n= Hrig\n\n(0, \u03b5) 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 /q n )\u22121 (class of \u03b5) .\n\nThe justification for this normalization requires a longer tour into the general\ntheory of syntomic cohomology than we would like to present. The reader may\nrefer to [Bes00a, Proposition 10.1.3] for example. In any case, note that this choice\nis functorial. We will make this definition in relative situations as well.\nWe now describe the regulator in this special case. First of all, consider f \u2208 A\u2217 .\nIf f \u0304 is the reduction of f one finds that \u03c6\u2217 f \u0304 = f \u0304q and therefore that f0 := f q /\u03c6\u2217 f\nis congruent to 1 mod the maximal ideal of R. One can deduce from that that the\nfunction log(f0 ) is analytic on some U\u03bb .\nLemma 4.7.

Suppose that X is an affine scheme and f : Y \u2192 X is a closed embedding\non an affine subscheme and choose the same auxiliary data for X as before. We may\ncompactify Y by embedding it into its closure Y in X. The difficulty in describing\nthe pullback map from X to Y is that the lift of Frobenius morphism \u03c6 will not\npreserve Y in general. Note however that we may and do assume that \u03c6 preserves\nY\u03ba . The way to overcome the difficulty is as follows: we use the embedding of Y\ninto X to compute the syntomic complex of Y .

We assume that i = n. Consider a situation\nwhere we are given an affine X together with a smooth affine map \u03c0 : X \u2192 B to\nanother affine scheme B smooth over R.

The integration down process\nA key ingredient in the computation of the regulator will be a functional on rigid\ncohomology obtained by repeated integration, which we now go on to describe.\nLet \u03ba be a field of characteristic p. Set X n = (P1\u03ba \u2212 {t = 1})n . Let B be an\naffine \u03ba-variety. Let Y be an open affine subset of X n \u00d7 B. Let n be the subset\nof Y where at least one of the coordinates is either 0 or \u221e. We write cohomology\nrelative to n to mean the multi relative cohomology taken in exactly the same way\nas was done in Section 3 for K-theory. We would like to write an explicit complex\ncomputing the multi relative rigid cohomology of Y .\nWe first choose the rigid data X n \u0592\u2192 (P1\u03ba )n \u0592\u2192 (P1Spf(R) )n and B \u0592\u2192 B \u0592\u2192 PB\nwhere B and PB are projective spaces of some degree over \u03ba and Spf(R) respectively.\nWe thus obtain a rigid datum for Y as well. As in Section 4 we obtain for \u03bb < 1\na certain inverse system of rigid space U = {U\u03bbY }. We know that there exists a\n\u2022\nn\ncanonical quasi-isomorphism \u03a9\u2022 (U Y ) := lim\n\u2212\u2192 \u03bb\u21921 \u03a9U\u03bbY \u2192 R\u0393rig (X /K). Similarly,\nthe complexes of rigid forms on the subspace of U\u03bb cut out by equations of the\nform ti = 0 or ti = \u221e are quasi\u2013isomorphic to the rigid complexes of the various\ncomponents in n .\nAs discussed (at length) in Appendix A, we can now write a complex quasiisomorphic to the multi relative R\u0393rig (X n ; n /K) by taking iterated cones on the\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n27\n\ncomplexes above with respect to the restriction maps to t \u2208 {0, \u221e}. We want to\ndo the \"battle of signs\" correctly to write this iterated cone as a simple complex.\nThis can be done as follows: For 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n consider all strictly increasing functions\nf : [1, . . . , j] \u2192 [1, . . . , n]. To such a function f we associate the subspace\nYf := {(x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Y : xi \u2208 {0, \u221e}, i \u2208\n/ im f }.\nY\nWe can similarly define rigid spaces Uf,\u03bb\nforming an inverse system UfY and like\n(4.3) we can formally define complexes of differential forms \u03a9\u2022 (UfY ). Let us call\nn \u2212 j the degree of f (this includes the empty function \u2205 with degree n), which\nis the same as the codimension of Yf . The complex computing our multi relative\ncohomology can then be written as \u2295i+deg f =k \u03a9i (UfY ) in degree k . Let us write\nan element in the f component of this complex as (\u03c9, f ). Then the differential is\ngiven by\nX\nd(\u03c9, f ) = (d\u03c9, f ) \u2212 (\u22121)deg \u03c9\n(5.1)\n\u03c7(f, g)(\u03c9|Yg , g)\ng\n\nwhere\n\u03c7(f, g) =\n\n(\n\n(\u22121)f (r)+r\n0\n\nim f = im g\u222af (r)\notherwise,\n\nand where here \u222a denotes disjoint union.\nDefinition 5.2. The complex above is denoted \u03a9\u2022 (U Y ; n ). We let F j \u03a9\u2022 (U Y ;\nbe the subcomplex having \u2295i+deg f =k,i\u2265j \u03a9i (UfY ) in degree k.\n\nn\n\n)\n\nThe following Lemma is mostly an exercise in sign fixing.\nLemma 5.3. The complexes F j \u03a9\u2022 (U Y ;\n\nn\n\n) and F j R\u0393rig (Y ;\n\nn\n\n/K) are quasi-isomorphic.\n\nProof. We prove this without the filtrations. The result for the filtered part is then\nclear. First we note that by Proposition 4.2 this complex is quasi-isomorphic to the\ncorresponding complex with \u03a9i (UfY ) replaced by the degree i part of R\u0393rig (Yf /K)\nwhich we now denote by \u0393i for simplicity. Consider now the double complex introduced in the appendix (compare (A.13) and (A.11)) For \u03b2 : [1, k] \u2192 [1, n] an\nincreasing function define Y\u03b2 = {(x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Y : x\u03b2(i) \u2208 {0, \u221e}}. Then the\ncomplex in degree q is \u2295k+|\u03b2|=q \u0393k (Y\u03b2 ). We can again write elements there as pairs\n(\u03c9, \u03b2) and the differential is defined by\nd(\u03c9, \u03b2) = (d\u03c9, \u03b2) + (\u22121)q (\u22121)|\u03b2|\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u2032 (\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 )(\u03c9|Y\u03b2\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 )\n\n\u03b2\u2032\n\nwhere\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7 (\u03b2, \u03b2 ) =\n\n(\n\n(\u22121)r\n0\n\nim \u03b2 \u2032 = im \u03b2 \u222a \u03b2 \u2032 (r)\notherwise,\n\nNow we want to switch to a dual point of view. The relation is as follows: For f a\nfunction as in the Lemma we define \u03b2(f ) to be the increasing function enumerating\n[1, . . . , n] \u2212 im f . Then we have |\u03b2(f )| = deg f and Yf = Y\u03b2(f ) . The key thing to\ncheck is the following: If g is obtained from f by deleting f (r), then \u03b2 = \u03b2(f ) is\nobtained from \u03b2 \u2032 = \u03b2(g) by deleting \u03b2 \u2032 (f (r)\u2212r+1). This easily gives the result.\n\n\f28\n\nAMNON BESSER AND ROB DE JEU\n\nConsider now the case where B = Spec(\u03ba) and Y = X n . Then the relative\nn\nrigid cohomology Hrig\n(X n ; n /K) is well known to be isomorphic to K. We can\nexplicitly describe this isomorphism. The basic idea (compare[Gro94]) is of iterated\nintegration between 0 and \u221e. We can take U\u03bbY to be U\u03bbn where U\u03bb denotes the\nspace P1K \u2212 {|t \u2212 1| < \u03bb} and U\u03bbn is the nth power of U\u03bb . Let (\u03c9, f ) \u2208 \u03a9n (U n ; n )\nand suppose that\n\u03c9 = G(tf (1) , . . . , tf (j) )dtf (1) \u2227 * * * \u2227 dtf (j)\n(here the ordering is critical).

Let HdR (U n ; n ) be the homology of \u03a9\u2022 (U n ; n ) We have the following.\n\nn\nLemma 5.4. There is a unique isomorphism HdR\n(U n ; n ) \u2192 K normalized by\nthe condition that on the class of a closed form (\u03c9, f ) with deg f = 0 it is given\nby \u03c0(\u03c9, f ). This functional is given as follows: consider a form (\u03b7, g) where g has\ndegree m and of the m coordinates on Ugn which are fixed i are fixed to be \u221e. Set\n\n\u03a0((\u03b7, g)) = (\u22121)i+\n\nP\n\n(g(k)+k)\n\n\u03c0(\u03b7, g).\n\nThen the functional is given by the restriction of the K-linear extension of \u03a0 to\nclosed forms.\nProof. We can find a form (\u03c9, f ), with deg(f ) = 0, whose cohomology class is nontrivial. The required isomorphism is determined by its value on such a form and\nis therefore unique. To show that \u03a0 provided the required map, we only need to\nshow, in view of the fact that \u03a0(\u03c9, f ) = \u03c0(\u03c9, f ) when deg(f ) = 0, that it kills exact\nforms.

From the proof of Proposition A.12 it is not difficult to get the following\nexplicit description of the map \u03a9\u2022 ( n ; n\u22121 ) \u2192 \u03a9\u2022+1 (X n ; n ) (dual to the map\n\u0003(C\u2022 ) \u2192 \u0003(Y\u2022 )[\u22121] in the notation of the proof of Proposition A.12): it is simply\ngiven by (\u03c9, f ) 7\u2192 (\u03c9, f ) where f : [1, . . . , j] \u2192 [1, . . . , n \u2212 1] is considered on the\nright as a function f : [1, . . . , j] \u2192 [1, . . . , n]. It follows that the map (5.5) with\nthe choice of signs as in the Proposition corresponds to the map sending \u03b1 \u2208 K to\n(\u03b1, \u2205) on the component with xi = 0 for all i. Applying \u03a0 to this we get \u03b1.\nNow comes a crucial point.

To prove the Lemma we\nHrig\n(X n ; n /K) \u223c\n= Hrig\nneed to show that the first arrow indicated in the diagram is not 0 while the last\nterm has strictly positive weights. The first assertion follows because it is easy\nto see that the same integration process described in Lemma 5.4 also vanishes on\nexact relative forms on the pair (Y ; n ). It remains to show the statement about\nthe weights. To do that we \"peel off\" the relativity step by step: We have a long\nexact sequence\n\n* * * \u2192 Hn\n\n({tn \u2208{0,\u221e}}\u2212Y ;\nn+1\nH(X\nn \u2212Y ;\n\nn\u22121\n\nn\n\n\u2212Y )\n\n\u2212Y )\n\n({tn \u2208 {0, \u221e}};\n\n(X n ;\n\nn\n\n) \u2192 H n+1\nn\n\nn\u22121\n\n(X \u2212Y ;\n\n)\u2192\nn\u22121\n\n\u2212Y )\n\n(X n ;\n\nn\u22121\n\n) \u2192 ***\n\nand the two terms on the sides fit into similar sequences. The key observation is\nthat the degree of the cohomology is always one more than the dimension of the\ni+1\ni\nspace. The final \"building blocks\" are of the form HX\ni \u2212Y (X ). By [Chi98] such a\nterm has weights between i + 1 and 2i (because X i \u2212 Y is always of codimension\n1 by our assumptions) except that the term with i = 0 clearly vanishes. Thus all\nterms have positive weights.\nn\nCorollary 5.8. Let M \u2282 Hrig\n(Y ; n /K) be any Frobenius invariant subspace conn\nn\n/K). Then there exists a unique K-linear functional\ntaining Hrig\n(X n ;\n\neM : M \u2192 K\n\u03a0\n\nwhich is fixed under Frobenius and coincides with the functional induced by \u03a0 on\nn\nHrig\n(X n ; n /K).\nn\nOf course the conclusion is also true with M = Hrig\n(Y ; n /K) in which case we\ne M simply by \u03a0.\ne We will need the uniqueness statement, however, for\nwill denote \u03a0\npossibly different subspaces.\ne gives a splitting of V = H n (Y ; n /K) into a direct sum V = K \u2295 E\nThe map \u03a0\nrig\nas a \u03c6-module, where E has no \u03c6-fixed vectors. We will need a certain result about\n\u03c6-modules with such a structure.\n\nLemma 5.9. Let Vi = K \u2295 Ei for i = 1, 2, 3 be three \u03c6-modules such that \u03c6 has\nno invariant vectors on Ei for each i and on E1 \u2297 E2 . Let \u03a0i : Vi \u2192 K be the\nnatural projection. Suppose there is a \u03c6-equivariant pairing h , i : V1 \u2297 V2 \u2192 V3\nwhich gives the usual multiplication when restricted to K \u2297 K. Then we have\n\u03a03 (hx1 , x2 i) = \u03a01 (x1 ) * \u03a02 (x2 ).\nProof. The conditions of the Lemma imply that the algebraic multiplicity of 1 as an\neigenvalue of \u03c6 on V1 \u2297 V2 is 1. It follows that the space of \u03c6-invariant functionals\non V1 \u2297 V2 is 1-dimensional.

This constant has to be 1 because the statement\nis true for xi = 1.\nBy assumption all components of Y are affine. We can therefore compute relative\nrigid cohomology using the complex \u03a9\u2022 (U Y ; n ) of Definition 5.2.\nDefinition 5.10. A relative form in \u03a9n (U Y ; n ) is called Coleman integrable if\nfor each of its component (\u03c9, f ) the expression defining \u03c0(\u03c9, f ) makes sense when\nwe replace ordinary integration with Coleman integration. If x is such a form we\ndenote by \u03a0Col (x) the expression derived from the \u03c0(\u03c9, f ) as in Lemma 5.4.\nLemma 5.11. Coleman integrable relative forms form a subspace of \u03a9n (U Y ; n )\nwhich is closed under \u03c6. Exact forms and forms extending to U n are Coleman\nintegrable. The functional \u03a0Col is \u03c6-invariant.\nProof. The only thing which possibly requires proof is the fact that if x is a relative\nform which is Coleman integrable, then so is \u03c6\u2217 (x) and \u03a0Col (\u03c6\u2217 (x)) = \u03a0Col (x).\nThis is an easy explicit computation. We may assume that\nx = (G(tf (1) , . . . , tf (j) ) * dtf (1) \u2227 * * * \u2227 dtf (j) , f ) .\nThen\n\u03c6\u2217 (x) = (G(tqf (1) , . . . , tqf (j) ) * d(tqf (1) ) \u2227 * * * \u2227 d(tqf (j) ) .\nThe assumption that x is Coleman integrable means the following: There is a\nfunction F1 (tf (1) , . . . , tf (j) ) which is a Coleman function in the first variable and\nsuch that\n\u2202\nF1 = G .\n\u2202tf (1)\nt\n\n=0\n\nSetting G1 (tf (2) , . . . , tf (j) ) = F1 |tff (1)\nwe can find a function F2 (tf (2) , . . . , tf (j) )\n(1) =\u221e\nwhich is again Coleman in the first variable such that\n\u2202\nF2 = G1\n\u2202tf (2)\nand we continue like this until we reach Gj which is just a number equaling \u03a0Col (x).\nNow we start with\ne f (1) , . . . , tf (j) ) = G(tq , . . . , tq )qtq\u22121 * * * qtq\u22121 .\nG(t\nf (1)\n\nf (j)\n\nf (1)\n\nf (j)\n\nThe functoriality of the Coleman integral implies that we may take\n\nq\u22121\nFe1 (tf (1) , . . . , tf (j) ) = F1 (tqf (1) , . . . , tqf (j) )qtfq\u22121\n(2) * * * qtf (j) .\n\nThen, as 0q = 0 and \u221eq = \u221e we get\ne1 (tf (2) , . . . , tf (j) ) = G1 (tq\nG\n\nf (2) , . . .\n\n, tqf (j) )qtfq\u22121\n(2) * * * qtf (j)\n\nand we can continue this process until we find \u03a0Col (\u03c6\u2217 (x)) = \u03a0Col (x).\n\nn\nWe call a cohomology class in Hrig\n(Y ; n /K) Coleman integrable if it is represented\nby a Coleman integrable form. Let MCol denote the space of Coleman integrable\ncohomology classes. It is an immediate consequence of the above that \u03a0Col induces\na functional MCol \u2192 K which is Frobenius invariant. By the construction it is\nalso clear that \u03a0Col is just \u03a0 on forms that extend to U n .

But\nthe proof of the statement shows there is a corresponding universal relation over\nZ[X, X \u22121 ] which can be pulled back. Alternatively, it can be deduced from the\nrelation in Q[X, X \u22121] because Fp [X, X \u22121 ] has no low weight K\u2013theory, and the\nlocalization map (in the limit) corresponding to Z \u2192 Q will induce an injection\n(up to torsion) on the level of symbols, cf. Proposition 3.16.) The right hand\nside satisfies the relation because it is true for Lin by (2.4) and for the remaining\nterms by a straightforward standard computation. Multiplication by a pk \u2013th root\nof unity preserves the residue discs, as does raising to pk power for sufficiently\ndivisible k (here we need to extend R to include these roots of unity). Therefore,\nit is immediately seen that the function En must be 0.\n\nRemark 7.13. The following comparison with the work of De Jeu is perhaps interesting. In the complex case one again relies only on the explicit description of\nthe form \u03c9 to obtain the corresponding formula for the regulator. A similar constant must be fixed in that computation as well. There however, one relies on the\nfact that the final result should be single valued. One then derives the distribution\nrelation from the corresponding formula for the complex polylogarithm and Borel's\ntheorem. Here we have used this distribution relation so our proof relies on the\nproof in the complex case. It may be interesting to mention that in the work of\nWojtkowiak on functional equations for polylogarithms [Woj91] a similar phenomenon occurs: To obtain a functional equation for p-adic polylogs one starts with a\nfunctional equation for the complex polylog and uses the multivaluedness to show\nthat a certain \"motivic\" functional equation is satisfied, which then translates into\na p-adic functional equation.\nProposition 7.14.

Any\nfunction in this combination, when composed with \u03c3, factors through the composed\ndifferential\nMn (O) \u2192 Mn\u22121 (F ) \u2297 FQ\u2217 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Mn\u2212k (F ) \u2297 (FQ\u2217 )\u2297k\nwhich maps [x]n to [x]n\u2212k \u2297 x \u2297 . . . \u2297 x. Therefore the functions Ln (\u03c3(x)) and\nLmod,n (\u03c3(x)) (and in fact, also Lin (\u03c3(x))), coincide on H 1 (M\u2022(n) (O)). But any\nfunction Lmod,n (z) satisfies Lmod,n (z) + (\u22121)n Lmod,n (1/z). Therefore the map\n[x]n 7\u2192 (\u22121)n (n \u2212 1)! Lmod,n (\u03c3(x)) factors through the quotient map Mn (O) \u2192\nfn (O). But the composition\nM\nf\u2022 (O)) \u2192 K\nH 1 (M\u2022(n) (O)) \u2192 H 1 (M\n(n)\n\nis still given by [x]n 7\u2192 (\u22121)n (n \u2212 1)! Ln (\u03c3(x)). Thus, the Theorem follows from\nProposition 7.14.\nProof of Theorem 1.12. Let F be a number field. Note that roots of unity will not\nbe special units in general, so we have to work in the complex for F rather than for\nO. Namely, let \u03b6 in F be a root of unity of order m > 1. If (m, p) = 1 \u03b6 is a special\nunit, and we have the result already. If m = ps l with s > 1 and (p, l) = 1, write\n\u03b6 = \u03b61 \u03b62 with \u03b61 of order ps and \u03b62 of order l. As the reduction of \u03b6 is the same as\nthe reduction of \u03b62 , we see that \u03b6 is special unless m = ps . If m = ps , let r > 1 be an\ninteger congruent to 1 modulo ps . Then \u03b6 r = \u03b6, and from\nP the distribution relations\nProposition 2.10 and (2.4) we find that [\u03b6]n = rn\u22121 \u03b1r =1 [\u03b6\u03b1]n in Mn (F \u2032 ) with\nF \u2032 = F (\u03bcr ). According to [Bes00a, Lemma 8.8] the modified syntomic regulator\ncommutes with finite base change. This means in the case we are considering that\nif R\u2032 is a finite extension of R there is a commutative diagram\n(n)\n\nK2n\u22121 (R)\n\n/K\n\n\u000f\n(n)\nK2n\u22121 (R\u2032 )\n\n\u000f\n/ K \u2032,\n\nwhere the map K \u2192 K \u2032 is the natural inclusion. We can therefore do our computations for the regulator just as well in K \u2032 = K(\u03bcr ). As all \u03b6\u03b1 in the sum\nare special units except when \u03b1 = 1, we can solve for reg([\u03b6]n ) as rn\u22121 6= 1. As\nreg([x]n ) = Lmod,n (x) if x is a special unit, and Lmod,n satisfies the corresponding\ndistribution relation by [Col82, Proposition 6.1], our result follows for m > 1. For\n\u03b6 = 1 one uses the distribution relation similarly.\nRemark 7.15. Although not needed for the purposes of this paper, we would like\nto sketch a somewhat less explicit method of doing the computations of this Section.\nThis was in fact our original method. The idea is quite easy to explain: Out of\nour regulator computations, we obtained the fact that for certain constants \u03b1k the\nfunction\nn\nX\nP (z, S) =\n\u03b1k fk (z, S) logn\u2212k S\nk=0\n\n\f42\n\nAMNON BESSER AND ROB DE JEU\n\nis a sum of a function of z and a function of S (first line of final computation).\nIn other words, its mixed derivatives vanish. We get this relation initially only for\nz and S which belong to the same residue disc, even though we know that using\nColeman integration the functions fn themselves extend to all z and S. What we\ndid was to write explicitly fn (z, S) in terms of logarithms and polylogarithms in\nz and S separately and then show that P (z, S) can indeed be written as a sum\nof a function of S and a function of z, the latter being our sought after regulator\nfunction. Note that the separation of variables now holds for any z and S.\nThe alternative approach is to deduce the \"global\" separation of variables from\nthe same result for z and S in the same residue disc using Coleman theory in 2variables. The theory developed in [Bes01a] defines a notion of a Coleman function\nin several variables. One then shows that iterated integrals of the kind used to define\nfn (z, S) make it a Coleman function in both variables (in particular for fixed S it is\na Coleman function in z, but note that the notion of being Coleman in two variables\nis stronger than the notion of begin Coleman in each variable separately). Coleman\nfunctions form a ring, which shows that P (z, S) is also a Coleman function, and\nso are its mixed derivatives. The theory then shows that the fact that the mixed\nderivatives vanish on some residue disc imply that they vanish identically which in\nturn implies a global separation of variables.\nKnowing a global separation of variables is very convenient, for if P (z, S) =\nP (z) + g(S), and all we need to know is P (z) up to a constant, then this is supplied\nby P (z, S0 ) for any S0 we take. In our particular situation, if one substitutes\nS0 = \u22121, whose log is 0, in the first line of the final computation we find that up\nto a constant P (z) = \u2212(\u22121)n n! * fn+1 (z, \u22121). So one is then left with computing\nthis function.\n\nAppendix A. Chern classes in relative cohomology\nIn this appendix we give the necessary constructions for the main paper as far as\nrelative K\u2013theory and Chern classes in syntomic cohomology are concerned. Most\nof this material is rather standard and has to be modified in a rather minor way\nin order to fit the current context, so we are sketchy in places. One thing that we\nwork out in glorious detail is the description of a complex that computes the multi\nrelative syntomic cohomology encountered in Section 5.\nIn [Bes00a] the first named author described a theory of rigid syntomic regulators. This is not sufficient in all applications, for example those described in the\npresent work, since one often needs to extend the regulators (= Chern classes) to\nthe relative situation. Our goal in this appendix is to explain how the construction\nextends to more general \"spaces\", yielding in particular Chern classes from relative\nK-theory to relative syntomic cohomology. The construction is completely formal,\nrelying primarily on [GS99] with some input from [dJ95].\nWe consider the category S of Noetherian finite dimensional schemes over R and\nthe topos T of sheaves on it with respect to the Zariski topology. Following [GS99]\nwe call a simplicial object of T a space. If X \u2208 S, Y 7\u2192 hom(Y, X) gives us an\nelement of T , which we still denote by X. With X+ we will denote the space\nconsisting of the disjoint union of the constant sheaf X and the constant simplicial\nbasepoint \u2217.\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n43\n\nLet S \u2032 \u2282 S be the subcategory of schemes which are in addition smooth and\nseparated over R, again equipped with the Zariski topology. Following [dJ95, Section 2.2] we make the following definition.\nDefinition A.1. A space X\u2022 is called a smooth separated pointed simplicial scheme\nif it is represented in each degree by a scheme in S \u2032 (interpreted as sheaf) together\nwith a disjoint base point and if it is furthermore degenerate above a finite simplicial\ndegree. In the sequel we shall refer to these spaces as pointed simplicial schemes\nfor short, unless stated otherwise.\nClearly, if X \u2208 S \u2032 , then X+ is a pointed simplicial scheme. According to [dJ95,\nLemma 2.1] a pointed simplicial scheme is K-coherent in the sense of [GS99, Section\n3.1, Definition 1] (this notion is also defined in [dJ95, top of page 201]).\nWhen X\u2022 and Y\u2022 are spaces, [X\u2022 , Y\u2022 ] denotes the set of morphisms between X\u2022\nand Y\u2022 in the homotopy category of spaces constructed in [GS99]. The point is that\nthere is an element K in T such that if X is a smooth finite type scheme over R,\nthen [S m \u2227 X+ , K] \u223c\n= Km (X) (loc. cit. Proposition 5 of Section 3.2). Gillet\u2013Soul\u00e9\ntherefore make the following Definition.\nDefinition A.2. If X\u2022 is a space, we define\nKm (X\u2022 ) = H \u2212m (X\u2022 , K) = [S m \u2227 X\u2022 , K]\nfor m \u2265 0.\nIn the body of the paper we have systematically used the K\u2013theoretic notation\nfor this, but in this Appendix we shall also use the notation H \u2212m (X\u2022 , K).\nIn [GS99], it is then shown that if X\u2022 is K\u2013coherent, then H \u2212m (X\u2022 ) has a special\n\u03bb\u2013ring structure. In particular, when X\u2022 is K\u2013coherent of cohomological dimension\nat most d, then according to loc. cit. Proposition 8 of Section 4.4, Km (X\u2022 ) \u2297Z\nLm+d (i)\n(i)\nQ = i=\u03b1 Km (X\u2022 ), with Km (X\u2022 ) = H \u2212m (X\u2022 , K)(i) the Q sub vector space of\nKm (X\u2022 )Q = H \u2212m (X\u2022 , K)Q of elements x such that \u03c8 k (x) = k i x for all k \u2265 2, and\n\u03b1 = 2 if m \u2265 2, \u03b1 = 1 if m = 1 and \u03b1 = 0 if m = 0. This will certainly apply to\na pointed simplicial space X\u2022 which is degenerate above simplicial degree N and\nwhere the maximum relative dimension of scheme components over R is M , with\nd = M + N + 1, cf. loc. cit. Lemma 1.2.2.2 or 3.2.4.\nFor two spaces X\u2022 and Y\u2022 we get a map Km (X\u2022 ) \u00d7 Kn (Y\u2022 ) \u2192 Km+n (X\u2022 \u2227 Y\u2022 )\nfrom the composition of\nS m+n \u2227 X\u2022 \u2227 Y\u2022 \u2192 S m \u2227 X\u2022 \u2227 S n \u2227 Y\u2022 \u2192 K \u2227 K \u2192 K\nbecause S m \u2227 S n = S m+n and K comes equipped with a map K \u2227 K \u2192 K. Under\n(i)\n(j)\n(i+j)\nthis product, we get Km (X\u2022 ) \u00d7 Kn (X\u2022 ) \u2192 Km+n (X\u2022 \u2227 Y\u2022 ) (loc. cit. top of\npage 48).\nIf X\u2022 and Y\u2022 are pointed spaces with a base pointed preserving map Y\u2022 \u2192 X\u2022 ,\nthen the reduced mapping cone C\u2022 = C(Y\u2022 , X\u2022 ), whose definition will be recalled\nlater, see (A.9), is also a pointed space, and one gets an exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Km+1 (X\u2022 ) \u2192 Km+1 (Y\u2022 ) \u2192 Km (C\u2022 ) \u2192 Km (X\u2022 ) \u2192 * * * .\nThe most important applications of these are if Y\u2022 is a pointed closed simplicial\nsubscheme of X\u2022 (i.e., the map corresponds to a closed embedding of schemes on all\nthe scheme components of X\u2022 ), in which case one gets the K\u2013theory of X\u2022 relative\nto Y\u2022 : Km (C\u2022 ) = Km (X\u2022 ; Y\u2022 ).

Let Z\u2022 be the closed pointed simplicial scheme complement of Y\u2022 in X\u2022 (i.e., the closed complement in every scheme component, together\nwith the base point \u2217), and assume all scheme components of Z\u2022 are regular. If\nalso conditions (TC1) and (TC2) of [dJ95, page 202] hold for the embeddings in\nZ\u2022 \u2192 X\u2022 , then Km (Z\u2022 ) \u223c\n= Km (C(Y\u2022 \u2192 X\u2022 )).

(i) on S \u2032 , where ? could\nstand for any of the versions of syntomic cohomology considered. By [Bes00a,\nProposition 6.2] these presheaves are pseudo-flasque T\nin the senseS that there is a\nMayer\u2013Vietoris exact sequence involving U , V , X = U V and U V for two open\nsubsets U and V of X. We associate to these presheaves spaces as follows: Consider\nfirst the sheaf \u0393\u0303\u2022? (i)\u2032 on S \u2032 associated to the presheaf \u0393\u2022? (i).

(We shall see shortly that,\nas the presheaves are pseudo flasque, using the associated sheaves does not change\nmuch.)\nThe remainder of this Appendix mainly consists of getting an explicit complex\nthat computes H \u2212m (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? (i)), first for pointed simplicial schemes and then more\nspecifically for those pointed simplicial schemes underlying the multi-relative K\u2013\ntheory. Together with the construction of Chern classes in Proposition A.15 below,\nthis provides the reference for the regulator and the complexes used in the explicit\ncalculations in the body of the paper.\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n45\n\nSo let X\u2022 be a (smooth separated) pointed simplicial scheme. If we write DT for\nthe derived category of Abelian chain complexes in T ,\nH 2i\u2212m (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? (i)) = [S m \u2227 X\u2022 , K(2i, \u0393\u0303\u2022?

(i)]DT .\nIf \u0393\u0303\u2022? (i) \u2192 I \u2022 is an injective resolution, this equals [N\u2217 (X\u2022 )[\u2212n], I \u2022 ] (maps up to\nchain homotopy), because the complex I \u2022 is bounded below ([Har66, p.67]).\nUsing the Yoneda lemma, we can compute this as in [dJ95, pages 214-216] as\nthe 2i \u2212 n\u2013th cohomology of the complex C \u2022 (X\u2022 , I \u2022 ) given by\nM\nM\nC q (X\u2022 , I \u2022 ) =\nhom(Xs , I t ) =\n(A.4)\n\u0393(Xs , I t )\nt+s=q\n\nN (X )\n\ns+t=q\n\n\u2022\n\nwith d(s,t) = (\u22121)q (ds \u2217 \u2022 )\u2217 + dIt , where of course we ignore the degenerate part\nof the scheme component of Xs as well as the basepoint \u2217 as we are working with\nthe complex N\u2217 (X\u2022 ).\nWe would like to be able to replace I \u2022 with \u0393\u2022? (i) in this complex. By using\na filtration in the simplicial index and the associated spectral sequence, it follows\nimmediately from the following two Lemmas that we can do this without changing\nthe cohomology of the complex.\nLemma A.5. Let P \u2022 be a complex of pseudo flasque presheaves of Abelian groups\non S \u2032 and let I \u2022 be an injective resolution of the associated complex of sheaves. If\nX \u2208 S \u2032 , then the natural map on global sections\n\u0393(X, P \u2022 ) \u2192 \u0393(X, I \u2022 )\nis a quasi isomorphism of complexes of Abelian groups.\nProof. The proof follows the proofs of Theorem 4 and Theorem 1' of [BG73] extremely closely, but it is easier as it is in the context of complexes of Abelian\ngroups rather than simplicial sets. Namely, for every open set U of X, let F \u2022 (U ) =\nCone(P \u2022 (U ) \u2192 I \u2022 (U )) Then it follows immediately from the five lemma that the\ncohomology of F (U ) satisfies a Mayer\u2013Vietoris exact sequence associated to two\nopen subsets U and V , hence is pseudo flasque. If we let T q (U ) be the q\u2013th cohomology group of the complex F \u2022 (U ), then the proof of Theorem 1' applies verbatim\nif we replace \u2217 with 0 everywhere, and take into account that our indexing is cohomological rather than homological.\nLemma A.6. Let F \u2022 be a complex of sheaves on S \u2032 and let X \u2208 S \u2032 . Then the\ncanonical map HSi \u2032 (X, F \u2022 ) \u2192 HSi (X, r\u2217 F \u2022 ) is an isomorphism.\nProof. This is essentially part of [Mil80, Proposition III.3.1], where it is stated for\na single sheaf and for the big site of schemes over X, but the proof is the same.\n\n\f46\n\nAMNON BESSER AND ROB DE JEU\n\nBecause the complexes \u0393\u2022?

Note that we are not using the fact that X\u2022 is degenerate above\na certain degree. Therefore, the description of cohomology as the cohomology\nof (A.7) is valid for such spaces as well, provided the components belong to S \u2032 . In\nparticular, it is valid for the classifying spaces BGLn over R.\nIn the paper, we have to use this complex on an iterated simplicial reduced\nmapping cone C\u2022 , which we recall is defined as follows.\nFor f : X\u2022 \u2192 Y\u2022 a map of pointed simplicial schemes, define the reduced mapping\ncone of f by\na\nC(X\u2022 , Y\u2022 ) = Y\u2022\n(A.9)\nX\u2022 \u00d7 I/ \u223c,\n\nwhere I is the simplicial version of the unit interval, given in degree s by all sequences {0, . . . , 0, 1 . . . , 1} of length s + 1, and pointed by {1, . . . , 1}, and \u223c are the\nusual identifications to obtain the reduced mapping cone.\nLet X be a scheme, and let Y1 , . . . , Yn , be subschemes. Denote by X+ the pointed\nsimplicial scheme consisting of X in every degree, together with a disjoint basepoint\n\u2217.

Using induction, one sees easily that the space C\u2022 one finds\nfor X, Y1 , . . . , Yn is as follows.\na\n`\n(A.10)\nY\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1n\nCm = \u2217\n\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1n\n\nm+1\n\n}|\n{\nz\nT\nwith \u03b1i \u2208 {{0, . . . , 0}, {0, . . . , 0, 1}, . . . , {0, 1, . . . , 1}}, Y\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1s = \u03b1i 6={0,...,0} Yi\nand \u2229\u2205 Yi = X. The boundary and degeneracy maps are the natural maps coming\nfrom the inclusions and the identity, which we get by deleting or doubling the i-th\nplace in the zeroes and ones, with the convention that we identify Y\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1s with\n\u2217 if at least one of the \u03b1's consists of only 1's. Clearly, C\u2022 is a pointed simplicial\nscheme, smooth if X, all Yj and all of their possible intersections are smooth. Due\nto our definition of the mapping cone, the reduced chain complex N\u2217 (C\u2022 ) no longer\nlooks like an iterated mapping cone of reduced chain complexes as there are too\nmany nondegenerate copies of intersections for n \u2265 2, and neither does the complex\nin (A.7).\nSo\n` we also define \u0003(C\u2022 ) to be the homological chainTcomplex given in degree k\nby |\u03b2|=k Z[Y\u03b2 ], with \u03b2 a subset of {1, . . . , n}, Y\u03b2 = i\u2208\u03b2 Yi , and Y\u2205 = X. The\nboundary is given on generators of \u0003(C\u2022 ) by\n(A.11)\n\nd(Y\u03b2 ) = (\u22121)k\u22121\n\nk\nX\nj=1\n\n(\u22121)j Y\u03b2\\{\u03b2j }\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n47\n\nif \u03b2 = {\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2k } with \u03b21 < \u03b22 < * * * < \u03b2k . (Just as in the complexes N\u2217 (*), the\nmaps here are the ones induced from the maps in the pointed spaces, which means\nthe correspond to the maps of sheaves that the scheme component represent in our\ntopos T .)\nProposition A.12. N\u2217 (C\u2022 ) and \u0003(C\u2022 ) are quasi isomorphic.\nProof. Define a map\n/ N\u2217 (C\u2022 )\n\n\u03a8 : \u0003(C\u2022 )\nvia\nY\u03b2 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 Y(\u03b2,\u03c3)\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\n\nin degree k, where (\u22121)\u03c3 is the sign of \u03c3, and (\u03b2, \u03c3) = \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n is an index defined\nas follows. We make \u03b1j = {0, . . . , 0} unless j is an element of \u03b2. The remaining\nk \u03b1j are indexed by \u03b2. We consider the k standard k + 1 tuples {0, . . . , 0, 1}, . . . ,\n{0, 1 . . . , 1}, and put \u03b1\u03b2\u03c3(j) equal to the j-th k + 1\u2013tuple in this list.\nWe have to check that \u03a8 defines a map of complexes. This is clear if k = 0. For\nk \u2265 1, \u03a8k\u22121 \u25e6 d is given by mapping Y\u03b2 (with |\u03b2| = k) to\n\u03a8k\u22121 ((\u22121)k\u22121\n\nk\nX\n\n(\u22121)j Y\u03b2\\{\u03b2j } ) =\n\nk\nX\nX\n(\u22121)k+j\u22121\n(\u22121)\u03c4 Y(\u03b2\\{\u03b2j },\u03c4 ) .\n\u03c4 \u2208Sk\u22121\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nOn the other hand, \u03a8k maps Y\u03b2 to\nX\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\n\nP\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u2208Sk (\u22121) Y(\u03b2,\u03c3) ,\nk\nX\n\nwhich d maps to\n\n(\u22121)j Ydj (\u03b2,\u03c3)\n\nj=0\n\nwhere dj is the j\u2013th simplicial face. Now notice that the j = 0 term here is zero, as it\nintroduces {1, . . . , 1} among the indices so this corresponds to \u2217 in C\u2022 , which maps\nto zero in N\u2217 (C\u2022 ). Also, for j = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 the j\u2013th and j + 1\u2013st indices become\nthe same after applying dj , so that \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u25e6 (j j + 1) give the same contribution,\nwhich cancels due to (\u22121)\u03c3 . Therefore only one term survives, corresponding to\nj = k, i.e., dk , which eliminates the last element of all the indices. So we are left\nwith\n(\u22121)k\n\nX\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 Ydk (\u03b2,\u03c3) = (\u22121)k\n\nk\nX\nX\n\n(\u22121)j\u22121 (\u22121)\u03c4 Y(\u03b2\u2212{\u03b2j },\u03c4 )\n\nj=1 \u03c4 \u2208Sk\u22121\n\nbecause if \u03c3(1) = j, the j\u2013th index in dk \u03b2 consists only of zeroes as well, and we\ncan write the corresponding term as a contribution in the sum on the right with\nk = j and \u03c4 = (k . . . j) \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 (1 . . . k) due to the renumbering involved.\nIn order to check that \u03a8 defines a quasi isomorphism, we proceed by induction\non the degree of relativity n. We investigate how \u03a8 behaves with respect to taking\ncones.\nSo let Y\u2022 \u2192 X\u2022 correspond to taking the last (n\u2013th) relativity into account,\nwith C\u2022 the corresponding reduced mapping cone. Let us first note that \u0003(C\u2022 )\nis the cone of the map \u0003(Y\u2022 ) \u2192 \u0003(X\u2022 ). Namely, any component C\u03b2 of \u0003(C\u2022 )\ncomes from \u0003(X\u2022 ) if and only if \u03b2 does not contain n, and that the components\ncontaining n correspond to Y\u03b2\\{n} 's, i.e., to \u0003(Y\u2022 )[\u22121]. So \u0003(C\u2022 ) is the mapping\ncone of \u0003(Y\u2022 ) \u2192 \u0003(X\u2022 ) provided the differential is the one on the cone. As \u0003(X\u2022 )\n\n\f48\n\nAMNON BESSER AND ROB DE JEU\n\nis a subcomplex, we only need to check what the differential does on C\u03b2 with n in\n\u03b2. Let k = |\u03b2|. Applying d we get\n(\u22121)k\u22121\n\nk\nX\n\n(\u22121)j C\u03b2\\{\u03b2j } = \u2212C\u03b2\\{n} \u2212 (\u22121)k\u22122\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)j C\u03b2\\{\u03b2j } ,\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nwhich is exactly what we want.\nWe shall verify that we have a map of triangles\n/ \u0003(Y\u2022 )\n\u03a8\n\n\u000f\n/ N\u2217 (Y\u2022 )\n\n/ \u0003(X\u2022 )\n\u03a8\n\n/ \u0003(C\u2022 )\n\u03a8\n\n\u000f\n/ N\u2217 (X\u2022 )\n\n\u000f\n/ N\u2217 (C\u2022 )\n\n/ \u0003(Y\u2022 )[\u22121]\n/\n\n\u03a8[\u22121]\n\n\u000f\n/ N\u2217 (Y\u2022 )[\u22121]\n/\n\nwith the maps as follows. The map \u0003(Y\u2022 ) \u2192 \u0003(X\u2022 ) comes directly from Y\u2022 \u2192 X\u2022 ,\nand similarly for N\u2217 (Y\u2022 ) \u2192 N\u2217 (X\u2022 ). The map \u0003(X\u2022 ) \u2192 \u0003(C\u2022 ) just views \u03b2, a\nsubset of {1, . . . , n \u2212 1}, as a subset of {1, . . . , n}. The map N\u2217 (X\u2022 ) \u2192 N\u2217 (C\u2022 ) is\nthe natural map from the map X\u2022 \u2192 C\u2022 . The map \u0003(C\u2022 ) \u2192 \u0003(Y\u2022 )[\u22121] maps Y\u03b2\nto 0 if n is not in \u03b2, and to Y\u03b2\\{n} if n is in \u03b2. The map N\u2217 (C\u2022 ) \u2192 N\u2217 (Y\u2022 )[\u22121]\nis the composition of the natural map N\u2217 (C\u2022 ) \u2192 N\u2217 (S 1 \u2227 Y\u2022 ) corresponding to\ncontracting X\u2022 to \u2217, and the Alexander\u2013Whitney map N\u2217 (S 1 \u2227 Y\u2022 ) \u2192 N\u2217 (Y\u2022 )[\u22121],\na quasi isomorphism (see (A.3)) as N\u2217 (S 1 ) is isomorphic to Z[\u22121] via the projection\nto the {0, 1}\u2013component in degree 1.\nWe shall check below that those maps give aSmap of triangles. It is well known\n(and using Mayer\u2013Vietoris for an open cover U V for nonreduced mapping cones\nof the realization of simplicial sets easily seen) that the bottom triangle gives rise\nto a long exact sequence in homology. As the top triangle also gives a long exact\nsequence, we know by induction that \u03a8 : \u0003(C\u2022 ) \u2192 N\u2217 (C\u2022 ) is a quasi isomorphism,\nas \u03a8 is clearly an isomorphism if n = 0.\nIn the diagram, the first square commutes because of the naturality of \u03a8. For the\nsecond square, we note that applying \u03a8C\u2022 on the image of \u0003(X\u2022 ) inside \u0003(C\u2022 ) is\nthe same as applying \u03a8X\u2022 and tagging on an index {0, . . . , 0} to the indices already\nused in N\u2217 (X\u2022 ). (The extra {0, . . . , 0} corresponds to n \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.) This is\nexactly the result as going around the second square counterclockwise, as X\u2022 is the\nsimplicial subscheme of C\u2022 , given by the components of C\u2022 that acquire a copy of\n{0, . . . , 0} from the simplicial interval involved in constructing the mapping cone.\nFor the third square, the map \u0003(C\u2022 ) \u2192 \u0003(Y\u2022 )[\u22121] corresponds to mapping to\nzero any Y\u03b2 with \u03b2 \u2286 {1, . . . , n\u22121} \u2282 {1, . . . , n}, and to Y\u03b2\\{n} if \u03b2 6\u2286 {1, . . . , n\u22121}.\nIf n 6\u2208 \u03b2, \u03a8(Y\u03b2 ) will always have the last index \u03b1n in Y\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1n equal to {0, . . . , 0},\nwhich already goes to zero in N\u2217 (S 1 \u2227 Y\u2022 ). If we have a P\nterm Y\u03b2 with n \u2208 \u03b2, let\nk = |\u03b2| \u2265 1. Going clockwise, we get \u03a8k\u22121 [\u22121](Y\u03b2\\{n} ) = \u03c3\u2208Sk\u22121 (\u22121)\u03c3 Y(\u03b2\\{n},\u03c3)\nin N\u2217 (Y\u2022 )[\u22121]. Going in the other direction, we get\nX\nY\u03b2 7\u2192\n(\u22121)\u03c3 Y(\u03b2,\u03c3)\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\n\nin N\u2217 (C\u2022 ). The Alexander\u2013Whitney map (A.3) maps this to\nk X\nX\n\nj=0 \u03c3\u2208Sk\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 dj+1 \u25e6 dj+2 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 dk ((\u03b2, \u03c3)n ) \u2297 dj0 Y(\u03b2,\u03c3)\\{(\u03b2n ,\u03c3)n } .\n\n\fTHE SYNTOMIC REGULATOR FOR K\u2013THEORY OF FIELDS\n\n49\n\nAfter the projection to {0, 1} in N\u2217 (S 1 ), we only get a nonzero contribution if\n(\u03b2, \u03c3)n = {0, 1, . . . , 1} and j = 1. Considering the definition of (\u03b2, \u03c3), this means\nthat \u03c3(n) = n, so that \u03c3 \u2208 Sk\u22121 \u2282 Sk . So we find\nX\n(\u22121)\u03c3 {0, 1} \u2297 d0 Y(\u03b3,\u03c3) ,\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\u22121\n\nwith \u03b3 = (\u03b2, \u03c3) \\ {(\u03b2, \u03c3)n }. Considering that d0 removes the first coordinate in all\nthe first n \u2212 1 tuples, d0 Y(\u03b3,\u03c3) = Y(\u03b2\\{n},\u03c3) . Projecting to the {0, 1}\u2013component in\nN\u2217 (S 1 ) = Z[\u22121], we therefore find\nX\n(\u22121)\u03c3 Y(\u03b2\\{n},\u03c3)\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\u22121\n\nas before.\nWe now return to our original problem of computing the cohomology groups\nusing explicit complexes. For C\u2022 = C (X, {Y1 , . . . , Yn }) as above, if all scheme\ncomponents are smooth of finite type over the base ring R, we can replace N\u2217 (C\u2022 ) by\nthe quasi isomorphic complex \u0003(C\u2022 ) by Proposition A.12 from the very beginning,\n\u2022\nso instead of (A.4) or (A.7), we can also use the complex C\u0003\n(C\u2022 , \u0393\u2022?

As this equals (\u22121)|\u03b21 |*|\u03b22 | \u03a8(Y\u03b21 ) \u2297 \u03a8(Y\u03b22 ) the\ndiagram commutes as required.\nNow suppose that A and B are homological chain complexes, with a cup product\nA\u2297B \u2192 C. There is a map \u03c6 : K(A)\u2227K(B) \u2192 K(A\u2297B) (with K the Dold\u2013Puppe\nconstruction as before), which gives rise to a map\n[S n \u2227 X\u2022 , K(A)] \u00d7 [S m \u2227 Y\u2022 , K(B)] \u2192 [S m+n \u2227 X\u2022 \u2227 Y\u2022 , K(A \u2297 B)]\n\u2192 [S m+n \u2227 X\u2022 \u2227 Y\u2022 \u2192 K(C)].\nIt is shown on [dJ95, page 215] that under our identifications [S n \u2227 X\u2022 , K(A)] with\n[N\u2217 (X\u2022 )[\u2212n], A]DT etc., this corresponds to the composition\nN\u2217 (X\u2022 \u2227 Y\u2022 )[\u2212n \u2212 m] \u2192 N\u2217 (X\u2022 )[\u2212n] \u2297 N\u2217 (Y\u2022 )[\u2212m] \u2192 A \u2297 B \u2192 C\nwith the first map the Alexander\u2013Whitney map and the last map the given product. In the cases we are interested in this becomes a cup product of sections in\n(pre)sheaves, and it follows from these formulae that the product on components\ncorresponds to cup products \u0393(Xs , A) \u00d7 \u0393(Yt , B) \u2192 \u0393(Xs \u00d7 Yt , C) up to signs. In\nparticular, for the explicit map at the very beginning of this Remark, the diagram\ntells us that the product in the complex (A.13) is up to a sign given by the map\n\u0393(Y\u03b21 , A) \u00d7 \u0393(Y\u03b22 , B) \u2192 \u0393(Y\u03b21\u03b22 , C),\nwhich is the composition of\n\u0393(Y\u03b21 , A) \u00d7 \u0393(Y\u03b22 , B) \u2192 \u0393(Y\u03b21 \u00d7 Y\u03b22 , C) \u2192 \u0393(Y\u03b21\u03b22 , C),\nthe last map being the pullback corresponding to the \"diagonal\" Y\u03b21 \u03b22 \u2192 Y\u03b22 \u00d7Y\u03b22 .\nThe previous constructions are applied in the body of the paper with the schemes\nX = (P1B \\ {t = 1})n and Yi = {ti = 0, \u221e},\nwith t the standard affine coordinate on P1 , and ti the i\u2013th coordinate in the n\u2013fold\nproduct, or localizations of those schemes.\nAfter this rather explicit exercise, we now turn our attention to the theory of\nChern classes. The theory of syntomic Chern classes of [Bes00a] can be extended\nfrom schemes to arbitrary spaces as follows. In loc. cit. before Theorem 7.5 universal\nChern classes\ncn \u2208 H 2i (BGL, \u0393\u2022? (i))\nwere constructed. Again this was explicitly done in some of the theories but it\ncan easily be done in all the others. Further, this was done with the cohomology\ndefined as the cohomology of the complex (A.7), but since the components of BGLn\nbelong to S \u2032 it follows from Remark A.8 that this is the same as the definition we\nhave been using here. Now a standard procedure [GS99, 6.1] produces, for each\n\u03b1 \u2208 H \u2212m (X\u2022 , K) a Chern class\nci (\u03b1) \u2208 H 2i\u2212m (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? (i)) .\nMore precisely, if K = Z \u00d7 Z\u221e BGL is the sheaf used to define algebraic K-theory\nof spaces as Kn (X\u2022 ) = [S n \u2227 X\u2022 , K], then each ci defines a map K \u2192 K(2i, \u0393\u0303\u2022? (i)).\nIf \u03b1 is an element in Km (X\u2022 ), then by composition we get the element ci (\u03b1) in\n[S m \u2227 X\u2022 , K(2i, \u0393\u0303\u2022? (i))] = H 2i\u2212m (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? (i)).\nFor a K-coherent space X\u2022 , both\nH \u223c (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? ) := H 0 (X\u2022 , Z) \u00d7 ({1} \u00d7 (\u2295i>1 H(X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? (i))))\n\n\f52\n\nAMNON BESSER AND ROB DE JEU\n\nand \u2295m\u22650 H \u2212m (X\u2022 , K) have \u03bb-ring with involution structures described in loc. cit.\n6.1. and there is a total Chern class\nc : \u2295m\u22650 H \u2212m (X\u2022 , K) \u2192 H \u223c (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? ) .\nProposition A.15. When X\u2022 is K-coherent the total Chern class in a morphism\nof \u03bb-rings with involutions.\nProof. Everything is reduced to the properties of the universal Chern classes (see for\nexample the proof of [GS99, Theorem 5] for the \u03bb-structure). These properties are\ndeduced in the following way. There is a map of complexes of sheaves (in the derived\ncategory) \u0393\u2022? (n) \u2192 \u0393\u2022dR , where the latter complex is the complex of differential\nforms on the generic fiber. We get an induced map of cohomology theories which\nis compatible with cup products and therefore also with \u03bb-operations. This map\ngives an injection\n(A.16)\n\n2i\n\u2295i H 2i (BGLN , \u0393\u2022? (i)) \u0592\u2192 \u2295i HdR\n(BGLN /K)\n\non the part of the cohomology of BGLN containing the Chern classes for any N .\nThe syntomic universal Chern classes are defined to map to the corresponding de\nRham Chern classes. Since both sides of (A.16) are closed under products, all required properties of syntomic universal Chern classes follow from the corresponding\nresults for the universal de Rham classes.\nAs all the cohomology groups are Q\u2013vector spaces, one gets a Chern character\nfrom this in the usual way (cf. [Sch88, \u00a74] or [Gil81, Definition 2.34]), which gives\na ring homomorphism\nreg : K\u2217 (X\u2022 ) = H \u2212\u2217 (X\u2022 , K) \u2192 H \u2217 (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? (\u2217)) .\n(j)\n\nwith the property that reg(Km (X\u2022 , K)) \u2286 H 2j\u2212m (X\u2022 , \u0393\u2022? (j)), cf.
