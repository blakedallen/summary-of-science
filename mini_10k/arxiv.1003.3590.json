In this paper we investigate these solutions from\na ten-dimensional point of view. In particular, we demonstrate that there exists an attractive\nclass of de Sitter solutions, whose geometry, fluxes and source terms can be entirely written in\nterms of the universal forms that are defined on all SU(3)-structure manifolds. These are the\nforms J and \u03a9, defining the SU(3)-structure itself, and the torsion classes. The existence of\nsuch universal de Sitter solutions is governed by easy-to-verify conditions on the SU(3)-structure,\nrendering the problem of finding dS solutions purely geometrical. We point out that the known\n(unstable) solution coming from the compactification on SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) is of this kind.\n\n1\n\nulf.danielsson at physics.uu.se, koerber at itf.fys.kuleuven.be, thomas.vanriet at fysast.uu.se\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFlux compactifications of IIA string theory with O6-planes allow for supersymmetric (susy)\nanti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua with all moduli stabilised at tree-level in both the string coupling\ngS and \u03b1\u2032 [1]. A natural, cosmologically more relevant, extension of this would be to achieve\nmoduli stabilisation at tree-level in a de Sitter (dS) background instead. We have to take\ncare, though, to circumvent the no-go theorems2 that make the construction of a de Sitter\nsolution a difficult task. Some of the ingredients required for circumventing de Sitter\nno-go theorems are already present in the setup of [1], such as non-zero Romans mass (F0 flux) and O6-planes. A further necessary ingredient is negative curvature of the internal\nspace [4, 5]. Negative curvature is not present in the original model of [1] since it assumed\nan internal Calabi\u2013Yau space. Fortunately, the generalisation of the supersymmetric AdS\nsolution of [1] turns out to be a compactification on an SU(3)-structure manifold [11\u201315],\nwhich is generically curved. As a consequence, de Sitter solutions in this generalised setup\nwhere found in three different papers [6\u20138]. We briefly discuss these three solutions as they\nplay an important role in the forthcoming.\nThe solutions of [6] and [7] are very similar in nature. They are both established\nnumerically by minimising the scalar potential in four dimensions. The internal space is\na group manifold with orbifold group Z2 \u00d7 Z2 and four intersecting smeared O6-planes.\nThe solution found in [6] uses the group manifold SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) while [7] contains two\nother examples, and the one that is most relevant to us is based on the solvable group\ns1.2. Although these examples are the first examples of classical 4d de Sitter solutions ever\nconstructed, they are perturbatively unstable and therefore not useful as true (metastable)\nvacua.\nRef. [8] constructed a class of 4d de Sitter solutions, directly in 10 dimensions, with the\nsame ansatz used for the susy AdS solution, albeit with different flux quanta, such that\nthe solution breaks supersymmetry and has positive energy. The condition for having a\nsolution to the ten-dimensional equations of motion translates in a simple condition on the\ntorsion classes [8]. However [8] did not provide an explicit manifold with torsion classes that\nsatisfies this condition in the case of a de Sitter-space. The aim of this paper is to amend\nthis, which requires us to generalise the universal de Sitter solutions of [8]. This situation\nis similar to the general susy AdS solutions, where first the conditions were constructed in\na general way [11], and later more geometries (next to the solutions of [16]), satisfying all\nthe constraints on the torsion classes, where found [12, 13].\nThis ten-dimensional approach based on universal forms has some advantages with\nrespect to the four-dimensional approach. First, it is technically easier than minimising a\nmultiple-variable function. Second, it is conceptually attractive since it describes a solution\nirrespective of the details of the geometry. It therefore describes a whole class of solutions 3 .\n2\n\nThe first of these no-go theorems for de Sitter solutions was established in [2], requiring negativetension sources, like O-planes, to circumvent it. It has been later extended in [3] by investigating the\ndependence of the 4d scalar potential on the dilaton and volume modulus. This has then been used to\nconstruct de Sitter no-go theorems tailored to various models [4\u20139]. See also [10] for a different approach.\n3\nOf course, issues like perturbative stability can only be addressed once a specific geometry is used.\n\n2\n\n\fThird, one is assured that the solution solves the ten-dimensional equations of motion and,\non the same footing, issues like flux and charge quantisation require a lift to ten dimensions\nanyway.\nThe generalisation of the universal de Sitter solutions of [8] we describe in this paper,\nhas a more general SU(3)-structure. The susy AdS solutions of [11\u201314] have vacuum\nexpectation values for the geometric moduli for which only two torsion classes (W1 , W2 ) are\nnon-zero. In this paper we generalise by allowing the third torsion class (W3 ) to be non-zero\nas well. The key result we have found is a geometry that explicitly satisfies the geometrical\nconstraints for the universal de Sitter solutions, thereby proving that universal de Sitter\nsolutions exist. Remarkably, we rediscover the known solution on the SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) group\nmanifold, thereby providing the lift of the solution to ten dimensions. But the main message\nof this paper is not about the details of that solution, rather, the proof of principle that the\nset of universal de Sitter solutions is non-zero. This probably indicates that there must be\nmany more geometries that allow the universal de Sitter solutions, and we hope to report\non a more thorough investigation of this soon [17].\nHowever not all de Sitter solutions should be universal since, as we explain below, the\nsolvmanifold solution [7] is not of this kind. Nonetheless, there is a simple argument why\none expects the universal solutions to be more likely. The Ricci tensor of SU(3)-structure\nmanifolds is entirely expressed in terms of the universal forms [18, 19]. From the Einstein\nequation this implies that the energy-momentum tensor should be written in terms of\ncontractions of these forms. The most natural way to achieve this is to assume that all the\nfluxes and sources are given in terms of these forms. Indeed, not only the known susy AdS\nsolutions are universal, recently also classes of non-susy AdS solutions were found using a\nuniversal ansatz [8, 15, 20\u201322]4 . In [22] it was even shown that sourceless solutions exist\nthat can achieve moduli stabilisation.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we establish our conventions for SU(3)structure and the type IIA supergravity equations of motion. In section 3 we present the\nuniversal de Sitter solutions, whereas in section 4 we investigate the conditions for universal\nde Sitter solutions on group manifolds with SU(3)-structure and establish that the group\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) fulfills all the constraints. The solution on SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) is discussed in\nsome detail in section 5. Finally in section 6 we end with a discussion.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries\nSU(3)-structure manifolds\n\nA six-dimensional SU(3)-structure manifold can be characterised by a globally defined\nreal two-form J and a complex decomposable three-form \u03a9 = \u03a9R + i\u03a9I , satisfying a\ncompatibility and a normalisation condition\n\u03a9 \u2227J = 0,\n\n\u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u2217 = (4i/3) J \u2227 J \u2227 J = 8i vol6 .\n\n(1)\n\n4\nThis was furthermore used for constructing Lifshitz solutions in type II supergravity [23, 24]. In this\ncase solutions were found in type IIA* supergravity and not in IIA supergravity [24].\n\n3\n\n\fFrom the real part of the three-form we can build an almost complex structure for which\nJ is of type (1, 1) and \u03a9 is of type (3, 0). It is given by\nI lk = c \u03b5m1 m2 ...m5 l (\u03a9R )km1 m2 (\u03a9R )m3 m4 m5 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the Levi-Civita symbol, and the real scalar c is such that I is properly normalised:\nI 2 = \u22121. The metric then follows via\ngmn = \u2212I lm Jln .\n\n(3)\n\nThe torsion classes W1 , . . . , W5 correspond to the expansion of the exterior derivatives\nof J and \u03a9 in terms of SU(3)-representations [25]. In this paper we will put W4 = W5 = 0\nand take W1 , W2 real (in our conventions), leading to a so-called half-flat manifold. We\nwill motivate this truncation in section 4.1. We find then\n3\ndJ = W1 \u03a9R + W3 ,\n2\nd\u03a9R = 0 ,\nd\u03a9I = W1 J \u2227 J + W2 \u2227 J ,\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n(4c)\n\nwhere W1 is a real scalar, W2 a real primitive (1, 1)-form and W3 a real primitive (1, 2) +\n(2, 1)-form. This means that\nW2 \u2227 J \u2227 J = 0 ,\nW2 \u2227 \u03a9 = 0 ,\n\nW3 \u2227 J = 0 ,\nW3 \u2227 \u03a9 = 0 .\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n\nFurthermore, we find that under the Hodge star, defined from the metric (3),\n\u22c66 \u03a9 = \u2212i\u03a9 ,\n\n\u22c66 J = 21 J \u2227 J ,\n\n\u22c66 W2 = \u2212J \u2227 W2 .\n\n(6)\n\nWe will make use of the fact that the Ricci tensor can be expressed in terms of the\ntorsion classes [18] (see also [19]). Let us first observe that any real symmetric two-tensor\nTij splits as follows in representations of SU(3)\nTij =\n\ns(Tij )\ngij + Tij+ + Tij\u2212 .\n6\n\n(7)\n\nHere s(Tij ) is the trace, an SU(3)-invariant, and Tij+ and Tij\u2212 transform as 8 and 6 +\n6\u0304 respectively. The latter are traceless and have respectively index structure (1,1) and\n(2,0)+(0,2)\nTij+ g ij = 0 ,\n\nI i k Tij+ I j l = Tkl+ ,\n\n(8a)\n\nTij\u2212 g ij = 0 ,\n\nI i k Tij\u2212 I j l = \u2212Tkl\u2212 .\n\n(8b)\n\n4\n\n\fFurthermore to Tij+ and Tij\u2212 a primitive real (1,1)-form and a complex primitive (2,1)-form\ncan be respectively associated\n1\n+\ndxi \u2227 dxj ,\nP2 (Tij ) = J k i Tkj\n2\n1\nP3 (Tij ) = Til\u2212 \u03a9l jk dxi \u2227 dxj \u2227 dxk .\n2\n\n(9a)\n(9b)\n\nUsing this decomposition it was shown in [18] that the Ricci tensor can be expressed\nas follows in terms of the torsion classes\n15\n1\n1\n(W1 )2 \u2212 (W2 )2 \u2212 (W3 )2 ,\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\nP2 (Rij ) = \u2212 \u22c6 (W2 \u2227 W2 ) \u2212 \u22c66 d \u22c66 W3 \u2212 W1 \u03a9R ,\n4\n2\n2\n1\nP3 (Rij ) = 2 W1 W3 |(2,1) + 2 dW2 |(2,1) \u2212 Q1 (W3 , W3 ) ,\n4\ns(Rij ) =\n\n(10a)\n(10b)\n(10c)\n\nwith\nQ1 (W3 , W3 ) = \u03a9ijk \u03b9j \u03b9i W3 \u2227 \u03b9k W3\n\n\u0001\n\n(2,1)\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nand where in the right-hand side of eqs. (10b)-(10c) the projection onto the primitive part\nis understood.\nFinally it will be convenient to extract the norms of W2 and W3 as follows\np\nW2 = w2 \u01742 ,\nw2 = (W2 )2 ,\n(12a)\np\nW3 = w3 \u01743 ,\nw3 = (W3 )2 ,\n(12b)\nwhere we introduced (W2 )2 = 21 W2ij W2ij and likewise (W3 )2 =\n\n2.2\n\n1\nW3ijk W3ijk .\n3!\n\nIIA supergravity with calibrated sources\n\nWe have to solve the equations of motion of type IIA supergravity, for which we will use\nthe string-frame equations listed in appendix B of [26], and put 2 \u03ba210 = 1. These equations\ncontain source terms and are valid when the sources are calibrated (which must be the\ncase if the sources are embedded supersymmetrically).\nThe dilaton \u03a6 and the warp factor A are taken to be constant (actually we take A = 0)\nand the fluxes Fn (n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 in the democratic formalism [27]) are decomposed as\nfollows in an \"electric\" and a \"magnetic\" part\nF = F\u0302 + vol4 \u2227 F\u0303 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere F\u0302 and F\u0303 have only internal indices. The self-duality constraint of the democratic\nformalism relates the electric and the magnetic flux so that it suffices to calculate the\n\n5\n\n\fmagnetic part in the following.

As compared to\nthe equations of motions of [26], we found it convenient to take linear combinations of the\nEinstein equation, its trace and the dilaton equation of motion.\n\n3\n\nUniversal de Sitter solutions in general\n\nThe basic idea of universal de Sitter solutions is to find solutions independent of the details\nof the compactification manifold. This can be done by writing down an ansatz in terms\nof form-fields that are defined on all SU(3)-structure manifolds. Then the equations of\nmotion translate into simple conditions on these form-fields. Once these simple conditions\nare satisfied for a given manifold, one has an explicit solution in ten dimensions. In ref. [8]\nsuch an ansatz was presented,5\ne\u03a6 F\u03020 = a1 ,\n\ne\u03a6 F\u03022 = a2 J + a3 \u01742 ,\n\n(15a)\n\ne\u03a6 F\u03024 = a4 J \u2227 J ,\n\ne\u03a6 F\u03026 = a5 vol6 ,\n\n(15b)\n\ne\u03a6 j = j1 \u03a9R ,\n\n(15c)\n\nH = a6 \u03a9R ,\n\nwhich also covers the supersymmetric AdS solutions6 . To find a solution different from the\nsusy AdS solution one has to impose [8]\nd\u01742 = c1 \u03a9R ,\n\n\u01742 \u2227 \u01742 = c2 J \u2227 J + d2 \u01742 \u2227 J ,\n\n(16)\n\n5\nCompared to [8] we have absorbed some convenient dilaton factors in the definition of the flux parameters, ensuring that all dependence on the dilaton drops out of the equations of motion. This implies that\nthe dilaton is a free parameter in the solutions we will present.\n6\nThe susy AdS solution of [11] is given by a1 = e\u03a6 m , a2 = \u2212W1 /4 , a3 = \u2212w2 , a4 = 3 e\u03a6 m/10 , a5 =\n9 W1 /4 , a6 = 2me\u03a6 /5 and j1 = \u22122e2\u03a6 m2 /5 + 3(W12 \u2212 2w22 )/8. The ansatz can be extended to also allow\nfor a term proportional to J \u2227 \u01742 in F\u03024 , which was used in [22] to construct non-susy AdS solutions.\n\n6\n\n\fwhere c1 , c2 , d2 are real proportionality coefficients. The coefficients c1 and c2 are fixed by\ninternal consistency of the SU(3)-structure equations,\nc1 = \u2212\n\n1\nc2 = \u2212 ,\n6\n\nw2\n,\n4\n\n(17)\n\nwhile d2 is specific to the geometry. The equations of motion then fix all geometrical\nquantities in terms of the flux parameters ai and the charge j1\nW1 = W1 (ai , j1 ) ,\n\nw2 = w2 (ai , j1 ) ,\n\nd2 = d2 (ai , j1 ) .\n\n(18)\n\nFurthermore, the parameters ai and j1 are related amongst themselves by the equations of\nmotion, such that there is a slice in the space formed by the variables (ai , j1 ) that solves\nthe equations of motion. We have explicitly demonstrated in [8] that there exist ranges\nof values for the parameters ai and j1 (on the parameter slice that solves the equations)\nsuch that the resulting cosmological constant is positive. However, up to now, we have not\nfound a geometry that can reach these values for the geometrical quantities (18).\n\n3.1\n\nThe ansatz\n\nBecause we have not yet found a suitable geometry that allows for the universal de Sitter\nsolution (15) we propose a more general universal ansatz, which considers a half-flat manifold and includes W3 as an expansion form. In a forthcoming paper [17] we will study this\nansatz in general. It turns out, however, that one obtains a very interesting simplified case\nif one puts\nW2 = 0 ,\n(19)\nwhich we will consider in this paper. The ansatz for the fluxes is then\ne\u03a6 F\u03020 = f1 ,\n\ne\u03a6 F\u03022 = f2 J ,\n\n(20a)\n\ne\u03a6 F\u03024 = f3 J \u2227 J ,\n\ne\u03a6 F\u03026 = f4 vol6 ,\n\n(20b)\n\ne\u03a6 j = j1 \u03a9R + j2 \u01743 .\n\nH = f5 \u03a9R + f6 \u01743 ,\n\n(20c)\n\nFor dS-solutions the source j will correspond to O6-planes. When writing such an ansatz,\none has to take into account the parity under the orientifold involutions. For O6-planes\nwe have that the fluxes H, F\u03022 and F\u03026 are odd whereas F\u03020 and F\u03024 are even. Furthermore,\nif the O6-planes are supersymmetrically embedded and thus preserve the SU(3)-structure\nwe have that J, \u03a9R and \u01743 are odd, therefore our ansatz is justified from that point of\nview.\nUpon plugging the ansatz in the equations of motion one immediately finds certain\nconstraints on the remaining torsion classes\nd \u22c66 \u01743 = c1 J \u2227 J ,\n(\u01743 i * \u01743 j )+ = 0 ,\n7\n\n(21a)\n(21b)\n\n\fwhere we find c1 = w3 /3! from computing d \u22c66 \u01743 \u2227 J. With the use of these constraints,\nthe equations of motion (14) lead to a set of algebraic relations for the constants fi and\nj1 , j2\n\u0001\n3\nf W + f1 f5 + j1 \u03a9R + (f2 w3 + f1 f6 + j2 ) \u01743 = 0 ,\n(22a)\n2 2 1\n(3f3 W1 \u2212 f4 f5 ) \u03a9R + (2f3 w3 \u2212 f4 f6 ) \u01743 = 0 ,\n\u0001\nf5 W1 + 61 f6 w3 \u2212 21 f1 f2 \u2212 2f2 f3 \u2212 f3 f4 J \u2227 J = 0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(W1 )2 + 21 (w3 )2 + (f6 )2 + 2f52 + 2j1 ,\nR4 = \u2212 15\n2\nR4 + (f1 )2 + 3(f2 )2 + 12(f3 )2 + (f4 )2 + 4j1 = 0 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 2(f5 )2 \u2212 21 (f6 )2 + 41 5(f1 )2 + 9(f2 )2 + 12(f3 )2 \u2212 (f4 )2 + 3j1 = 0 ,\nh\ni\n2\n2\n1\n2(W1 w3 \u2212 j2 \u2212 2f5 f6 )\u01743 |(2,1) \u2212 4 w3 Q1 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) + f6 Q2 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) = 0 ,\n\nwhere\n\nQ2 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u01743 imn \u01743 pmn \u03a9pjk dxi \u2227 dxj \u2227 dxk\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(22b)\n\n(22c)\n(22d)\n(22e)\n(22f)\n(22g)\n\n(23)\n\n(2,1)\n\nWe note that using the decomposition (7)-(9), eq. (14g) would normally have a two-form\nand a three-form part. The two-form part is satisfied using the constraint (21b), while the\nthree-form part leads to (22g) above.\nWe see that the three-form piece of the internal Einstein equation leads to further\nconstraints. We will put\nQ1 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) = c2 Q2 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) = c3 (\u01743 )2,1 .\n\n(24)\n\nThe equations (22) will then lead to relations between the coefficients fi , j1 , j2 and the\nparameters w3 , c2 , c3 characterising the geometry.\n\n3.2\n\nThe solutions\n\nWe will now study the solutions to the equations (22), in particular those with R4 > 0,\nwhich are the dS solutions. We will demonstrate later on that with the O-plane configuration of section 4.1 one obtains\nQ1 = Q2 \u21d2 c2 = 1 ,\n\n8\nc3 = \u221a .\n3\n\n(25)\n\nFor these choices one can show that f3 and f4 have to be zero in order to find a de Sitter\nsolution7 . Once f3 = f4 = 0 the general solution to the equations forms a two-dimensional\nset in the parameter space. The equations are however invariant under an overall rescaling\nfi \u2192 \u03bbfi ,\n\nji \u2192 \u03bb2 ji ,\n\nR4 \u2192 \u03bb2 R4 ,\n\nW1 \u2192 \u03bbW1 ,\n\nw3 \u2192 \u03bbw3 .\n\n(26)\n\nDe Sitter solutions to eqs. (22) also exist when c3 6= \u221a83 and then one can take f3 , f4 non-zero. The\ngeometry should then, however, fall outside the class studied in section 4 and we have not found such an\nexample.\n7\n\n8\n\n\f\u039b/(f1 )2\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nf2 /f1\n\n4\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.008\n\n0.008\n\n0.004\n\n0.004\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n0.\n\n0.\n\n-0.004\n-3\n\n-0.004\n1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n-4\n\n\u221a\nFigure 1: \u039b/(f1 )2 as a function of f2 /f1 , for c3 = 8/ 3 and f3 = f4 = 0. The area close to\nthe horizontal axis is shown in more detail such that the dS solutions (in green) are visible.\nAdS solutions are shown in red and Minkowski solutions in blue.\nWe will choose to factor out this overall scale by dividing each quantity by appropriate\nfactors of f1 (which is equivalent to considering solutions with f1 = 1). We then end\nup with a one-dimensional set of solutions that include non-susy AdS solutions, non-susy\nMinkowski solutions and de Sitter solutions.\nThis is made clear in figure 1, where we plot the value of the cosmological constant\n(vertical axes) against f2 /f1 (horizontal axis). This plot contains all kinds of solutions,\nbut to make the de Sitter solutions visible, in an inset we zoomed in on an area very close\nto the horizontal axis. Most essential in the figure is the interval with de Sitter solutions\nbounded from below by a Minkowski point at f2 /f1 = 0.965 and this forms our key result.\nFor large values of f2 /f1 the line of de Sitter solutions asymptotes to a line of Minkowski\nsolutions, which are remarkably simple solutions taking the form\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n3\nf2\n(27)\nf5 /f1 = ,\nf6 /f1 =\n,\nW1 =\n,\nw3 /W1 = 3 3 .\n4\n2\n2\nThis phenomenon, where de Sitter solutions interpolate between Minkowski solutions in\nparameter space, was first observed in [28], which obtained similar results from a fourdimensional point of view. Here we gain the extra insight of a ten-dimensional interpretation. On one side the bounding four-dimensional Minkowski solutions are the remarkably\nsimple solutions (27) with fluxes along the universal forms. On the other side we find\na Minkowski solution where the curve of figure 1 crosses the x-axis (as displayed in the\ninset). For the de Sitter solutions itself the explicit forms of the parameters fi are not that\ninsightful, so apart from the plots we do not present them explicitly.\nMost abundant are the non-supersymmetric AdS branches in solution space. It seems\na generic property of tree-level flux compactifications (allowing dS solutions) that the AdS\nsolutions far outnumber the dS solutions.\nFigure 2 displays the ratio w3 /W1 on the vertical axis and f2 /f1 on the horizontal axis.\nThis plot reveals that the ratio w3 /W1 is bounded from above for all solutions and that\n9\n\n\fw3 /W1\n6\n\n5\n\n(0.965,4.553)\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nPSfrag replacements\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nf2 /f1\n\n-1\n\n\u221a\nFigure 2: w3 /W1 as a function of f2 /f1 , for c3 = 8/ 3. dS solutions are green, AdS\nsolutions red and Minkowski solutions blue.\n\u221a\nthe saturation value w3 /W1 = 3 3 corresponds to the line of Minkowski solutions (27).\nFurthermore we read off from the plot that in other to obtain dS solutions one must find\na geometry such that\n\u221a\n4.553 < w3 /W1 < 3 3 .\n(28)\n\n4\n4.1\n\nUniversal de Sitter solutions on group manifolds\nGroup manifolds, orientifolds and SU(3)-structures\n\nGroup manifolds form an interesting class of candidates for the internal manifold. If the\nsix-dimensional group manifold G is not already compact we assume that there exists a\ndiscrete subgroup \u0393 \u2282 G, without fixed points, such that G/\u0393 is a compact manifold. This\n\u0393 does not always exist and we refer to [29] (and references therein) for a discussion on\nthis. On G we have six, globally-defined, left-invariant one-forms (a.k.a. Maurer\u2013Cartan\nforms), ei , with i = 1, . . . , 6. These forms obey the Maurer\u2013Cartan relations\ndei = 12 f i jk ej \u2227 ek ,\n\n(29)\n\nwith f the structure constants of the Lie algebra g associated to G. We will restrict\nourselves to the supergravity degrees of freedom that are expanded along these left-invariant\nforms, which are named the left-invariant degrees of freedom.\nA compactification of a supergravity theory on such spaces leads to a lower-dimensional\nsupergravity theory with the same amount of supersymmetries, if one restricts to the leftinvariant degrees of freedom. Therefore, if we desire de Sitter solutions in an N = 1\nsupergravity theory we need at least three intersecting O6-planes (implying a fourth).\nNaively extending the Tseytlin rules for brane intersections in flat space to the case of a\ngroup manifold, leads to the following intersection of four O6-planes (we present only the\ninternal directions)\n10\n\n\fe1 e2 e3\nN N N\nN\n\u2013\n\u2013\nN\n\u2013\n\u2013\nN\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\ne4\n\ne5\n\ne6\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nN N\n\u2013\nN N\n\u2013\nN\nN\n\u2013\n\nwhere each entry denotes a left-invariant direction. This intersection is unique up to\nrelabeling of the O6-planes and relabeling the Maurer\u2013Cartan forms. From this we find\nthat the smeared orientifold source is given by\nj6 = jA e456 + jB e236 + jC e134 + jD e125 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwith the corresponding involutions\nA:\nB:\nC:\nD:\n\n(e4 , e5 , e6 ) \u2192\n(e2 , e3 , e6 ) \u2192\n(e1 , e3 , e4 ) \u2192\n(e1 , e2 , e5 ) \u2192\n\n\u2212(e4 , e5 , e6 ) ,\n\u2212(e2 , e3 , e6 ) ,\n\u2212(e1 , e3 , e4 ) ,\n\u2212(e1 , e2 , e5 ) .\n\n(31)\n\nNote that\nA.B.C = D .\n\n(32)\n\nThis shows that three O6-involutions, in this setting, imply the fourth. Alternatively, one\ncan look at this as one orientifold involution (say A) together with the orbifold group\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 generated by AB and BC. Therefore our compactification space is\nG\n.\n\u0393 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z2\n\n(33)\n\nWhen the orbifold singularities are blown up, we generate new moduli commonly denoted\nas the twisted sector. We do not discuss this any further, but a thorough analysis of moduli\nstabilisation should also include these modes.\nThere are no one-forms that have the same parity under A, B, C and D. Furthermore,\nonly two-forms with a fixed parity all have \b\nnegative parity and are spanned by\n\b 16 the\ne , e24 , e35 . The odd three-forms are spanned by e456 , e236 , e134 , e125 . Since J and\n\u03a9R must be odd under orientifold involutions preserving the SU(3)-structure, we find that\nthey must be of the form\nJ = ae16 + be24 + ce35 ,\n\u03a9R = v1 e456 + v2 e236 + v3 e134 + v4 e125 ,\n\n(34a)\n(34b)\n\nwith a, b, c, v1 , . . . , v4 real coefficients. With some abuse of language we name a, b, c the\nK\u00e4hler moduli and v1 , . . . , v4 the complex structure moduli. Note that this implies the\ncalibration conditions\nj6 \u2227 \u03a9R = 0 = j6 \u2227 J .\n(35)\n11\n\n\fThe orientifold involutions also restrict the possible metric flux, which must be even, or\nequivalently the possible group manifolds. In particular, the Lie algebra should be of the\nfollowing form\nde1 = f 1 23 e23 + f 1 45 e45 ,\nde3 = f 3 12 e12 + f 3 46 e46 ,\nde5 = f 5 14 e14 + f 5 26 e26 ,\n\nde2 = f 2 13 e13 + f 2 56 e56 ,\nde4 = f 4 36 e36 + f 4 15 e15 ,\nde6 = f 6 34 e34 + f 6 25 e25 .\n\n(36)\n\nAs a consistency check one finds that dJ indeed gives only rise to odd three-forms and that\nd\u03a9R = 0 automatically. Furthermore, the algebra is unipotent (f a ab = 0) automatically.\nUnipotence is a necessary condition for having a compact group manifold (after the quotient\nby a discrete subgroup \u0393 if need be). The Jacobi identities, which are equivalent to the\nnilpotence d2 ei = 0, impose further quadratic constraints on the f 's.\nFrom\nJ \u2227 J \u2227 J = \u22126 abc e123456 ,\n(37)\n\nwe find that (for our choice of orientation) abc < 0 rendering all or one of the coefficients\na, b, c negative. In order to be able to properly normalise I 2 = \u22121 with real c in (2) we\nneed furthermore v1 v2 v3 v4 > 0.

Furthermore, we can construct the remaining torsion classes from the identities8\nW1 = \u2212 16 \u22c66 (dJ \u2227 \u03a9I ) ,\nW2 = \u2212 \u22c6 d\u03a9I + 2W1 J ,\nW3 = dJ \u2212 32 W1 \u03a9R .\n\n(41a)\n(41b)\n(41c)\n\nThe parity properties further imply the following relations\ndW2 \u2227 W3 = 0 ,\nW2 \u2227 \u22c66 W3 = 0 .\n\ndW3 = 0 ,\nW2 \u2227 W3 = 0 ,\n\n(42)\n\n8\nTo understand how the torsion classes depend on all moduli is not too hard for these simple examples,\nbut formulae for more general cases have been derived in [30].\n\n12\n\n\f4.2\n\nde Sitter no-go theorems\n\nThe above choice of orbifold/orientifold group is not unique and we chose it for simplicity.\nBut, interestingly, all other choices of orbifold groups have shown not to admit any de\nSitter solutions according to [7].\nThe explicit form of the de Sitter no-go theorem of [7], in our setup, implies that the\nmatrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 1\nf 45\nf 1 23 \u2212f 6 34 \u2212f 6 25\nf 4 15 \uf8f8\nF = \uf8ed f 2 56 \u2212f 4 36 f 2 13\n(43)\n3\n5\n5\n3\n\u2212f 46 f 26\nf 14\nf 12\n\nshould have at least two columns non-zero and three rows non-zero.\nIt is not straightforward to classify all six-dimensional Lie-algebras that can be written\nas (36). But once an algebra is found it is easy to check the no-go theorem. We postpone a\nfull classification of groups and cosets that violate the no-go theorem to the future. Sofar\nwe have found four algebras which fulfill the conditions\nSO(4) ,\n\nSO(3, 1) ,\n\nSO(2, 2) ,\n\ns1.2 ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere s1.2 is the solvable algebra that appears in e.g. the classification of [29]. Note that\nSO(4) = SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) and SO(2, 2) = SU(1, 1) \u00d7 SU(1, 1).\nThe first and the last correspond to the algebras used for the de Sitter solutions constructed in [6, 7]. The last three algebras correspond to non-compact groups and one has\nto demonstrate that they can be compactified. We do not discuss this here, but mention\nthat this can depend on the explicit solution, since the symmetries of the metric depend\non the expectation values for the metric scalars a, b, c, v1 , . . . , v4 .\nThe algebras are explicitly given by9\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n+1 +1 +1 \u22121\n+1 +1 +1 \u22121\n1\n1\nFSO(2,2) = \uf8ed\u22121 +1 +1 +1\uf8f8 ,\nFSO(4) = \uf8ed+1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121\uf8f8 ,\n2\n2\n+1 \u22121 +1 +1\n+1 \u22121 +1 +1\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n(45)\n\u22121 +1 +1 \u22121\n\u22121 +1 0 0\n1\n1\nFSO(3,1) = \uf8ed\u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121\uf8f8 ,\nFs1.2 = \uf8ed\u22121 \u22121 0 0\uf8f8 ,\n2\n2\n\u22121 \u22121 +1 +1\n+1 +1 0 0\nup to re-scalings, permutations, and other transformations in GL(6, IR) that preserve the\nform (36). We expect more algebras to exist that evade the no-go theorem of [7] and more\ndetails will be presented elsewhere [17].\n\n4.3\n\nConstraints on the torsion classes\n\nWith some explicit algebras at hand we can check the various conditions for allowing the\nuniversal de Sitter solution of the previous section. Let us recapitulate the conditions on\n9\nThe basis for SO(4) is related to the basis used in e.g. [13] (which we label \u1ebdi ) as follows: e1 =\n\u1ebd1 + \u1ebd4 , e2 = \u1ebd2 + \u1ebd5 , e3 = \u1ebd3 + \u1ebd6 , e4 = \u1ebd2 \u2212 \u1ebd5 , e5 = \u1ebd3 \u2212 \u1ebd6 and e6 = \u1ebd1 \u2212 \u1ebd4 .\n\n13\n\n\fthe torsion classes\nW2 = 0 ,\nd \u22c66 \u01743 = c1 J \u2227 J ,\n(\u017432 )+\nij = 0 ,\n\n(46a)\n(46b)\n(46c)\n\nQ1 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) = c2 Q2 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) ,\n\n(46d)\n\nQ1 (\u01743 , \u01743 ) = c3 (\u01743 )2,1 .\n\n(46e)\n\nTaking into account the restricted set of odd three-forms under the orientifold involutions\n(see the discussion before (34)) we can verify that constraint (46c) is automatic as well as\n(46d) for c2 = 1.\nLikewise, constraint (46e) can be simplified using the O-plane ansatz. Let us write\nW3 = \u03b11 e456 + \u03b12 e236 + \u03b13 e134 + \u03b14 e125 ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere we note that the \u03b1i are not entirely arbitrary as W3 needs to be a simple (2,1)+(1,2)form. After some algebra one finds that (46e) leads to the following four simple equations\n!\n\u03b1i\n3\u03b1i2 X \u03b1j2\n\u2212\n= c3 w 3 .\n(48)\n2\n2\n2\nvi\nv\nv\ni\nj\nj6=i\n\nOne verifies that these equations are only consistent when\n8\nc3 = \u00b1 \u221a\n3\n\nor c3 = 0 .\n\n(49)\n\nWe do not consider the case c3 = 0 as we have not found any interesting results with that\nvalue. Furthermore, we can always take the positive value for c3 by allowing w3 and \u01743 to\nflip sign (under which the physical W3 does not change).\nThe remaining constraint equations need to be imposed and fix the geometric moduli\na, b, c, vi . Furthermore we found from the analysis of section 3.2 that we need\n\u221a\n4.553 < w3 /W1 < 3 3 .\n(50)\nWe have investigated these constraints for the four algebras listed above and only for\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) we found that the constraints lead to a solution. In all other cases one finds\na complex solution or a solution with a metric that is not positive-definite anymore. For\nSO(3,1) we came close, but then (50) was violated.\nThis implies that the de Sitter solution of [7], which was found for the s1.2 algebra, is\nnot captured with our ansatz. We have also checked that it can not be found from the\nmore extended ansatz with W2 6= 0. It would be interesting to understand how many extra\nnon-universal forms one needs to describe this solution from a ten-dimensional viewpoint.\n\n14\n\n\fThe solution on SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\n\n5\n\nLet us now demonstrate that on the group manifold SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) one can satisfy all\nthe constraints (46a-46e,49,50) above and construct a dS solution. The geometric moduli\nvalues for which SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) obeys the constraints (46a-46e) are given by\na = \u2212b = c ,\n\nv1 = v2 = v4 ,\n\nFor these values we have explicitly\n\u0010 4\n\u0011\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\ng = diag (va1 )2 , (va12) , (va1 )2 , (va1 )2 , (va12) , (va12) ,\n\nv3 =\n\na6\n.\n(v1 )3\n\n(51)\n\n(52a)\n\na6 + v14\n,\nW2 = 0 ,\n(52b)\n4 a5 v1\n\u221a\n\u0003\na6 \u2212 3(v1 )4 \u0002\n3(a6 \u22123(v1 )4 )\n4 456\n236\n125\n6 134\n(v\n)\n(e\n+\ne\n+\ne\n)\n\u2212\n3\na\ne\n,\nw\n=\n\u2212\n, (52c)\nW3 =\n1\n3\n4a5 v1\n5\n4\n8 a (v1 )\n\u221a\nwhere we have chosen the sign of w3 such that c3 = 8/ 3.10\nWe find furthermore that\n\u221a\n3(3(v1 )4 \u2212 a6 )\nw3 /W1 =\n(54)\na6 + (v1 )4\n\u221a\n\u221a\ntakes values in the interval \u2212 3 < w3 /W1 < 3 3 so that we can satisfy (50) and find dS\nsolutions (as well as a Minkowski solution at w3 /W\nbelow that\n\u221a 1 = 4.553 and AdS solutions\n4\nvalue). Note that since the endpoint w3 /W1 = 3 3 would correspond to (v1 ) /a6 \u2192 \u221e we\ncannot actually construct the Minkowski solution (27). It is amusing to see the geometry\nof SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) seems to know about the type IIA supergravity equations of motion in\nthat the upper bound for w3 /W1 on SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) corresponds to the upper bound for any\ntype of solutions in figure 2.\nUsing N = 1 supergravity techniques along the lines of [6] it is possible to calculate\nthe scalar potential and obtain the eigenvalues of the (14 \u00d7 14) mass matrix for the leftinvariant fluctuations around our dS solutions. We found that there are always unstable\ndirections. In figure 3 we make a plot of the negative eigenvalues. In particular we have\none tachyonic direction for f2 /f1 < 2.16 and three tachyonic directions beyond this values,\nas shown in the figure 3. The two extra tachyons that appear beyond f2 /f1 = 2.16 have\nthe same negative (mass)2 and since it is small compared to the other masses, we have\nzoomed in on it in the figure.\nW1 =\n\n10\n\nThat this configuration satisfies the constraints (46a-46c) and 46e can be easily seen as follows. Consider the exchanges\np1 : e 1 \u2194 e 4 , e 6 \u2194 e 2\np2 : e 1 \u2194 e 3 , e 6 \u2194 e 5 .\n(53)\n\nOne easily sees that the only even two-form under these interchanges is J, while from the three-forms\nodd under the orientifold involutions, the ones also odd under this symmetry group are spanned by \u03a9R\nand W3 . Furthermore, the structure constants and thus the exterior derivative are also odd. The above\nconstraints now follow from the transformation properties under these exchanges.\n\n15\n\n\fM 2 /(f1 )2\n0.000\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nf2 /f1\n\n3.0\n\n-0.005\n2.\n0.\n\n2.5\n\n3.\n\n2.5\n\n3.\n\n-0.010\n\n-0.015\n-5. * 10-8\n\n-0.020\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n-1. * 10-7\n-0.025\n\n2.\n\n-0.030\n\nFigure 3: Negative eigenvalues of the mass matrix M 2 /(f1 )2 for our line of dS solutions.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have established the fact that the class of universal de Sitter solutions exists by at\nleast providing one explicit example: an unstable de Sitter solution on an orientifold of\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2). This solution turns out to be the ten-dimensional lift of the solution\nfound in [6]. Furthermore, the other explicit solution, coming from (an orientifold) of the\nsolvmanifold s1.2 [7] is not universal, which demonstrates that the class of universal de\nSitter solutions does not cover all of the classical de Sitter solutions. But, as we argued in\nthe introduction, we believe that most natural solutions are of this form and we hope to\nreport on more examples in a future work [17].\nObviously, the understanding of classical de Sitter solutions is very incomplete, and\nsofar no conclusion can be drawn regarding the existence of phenomenologically viable\nsolutions. The requirements for phenomenological viability are plenty, and some requirements can be dropped for other purposes. Especially if we want a simple de Sitter solution\nfor the sake of understanding holography, or more general, quantum gravity in de Sitter\nspace-time, we can drop the requirement for a small cosmological constant, a decoupling of\nKK modes, etc. The most important requirement is perturbative stability. The two examples coming from SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) and the solvmanifold s1.2 are both perturbative unstable.\nThis is not surprising since the lack of supersymmetry does not protect one from tachyons\nin the spectrum. Since most simple models have order 10 moduli, one has to be rather\nlucky that all of them have positive mass. In case one is allowed to think that, in the\nabsence of susy, there is an equal chance for a field direction to be unstable or stable, then\none is forced to conclude that stable solutions must exist if there are enough classical de\nSitter solutions in the landscape. But, the existence of meta-stable non-susy AdS solutions\nseems to demonstrate that one should not apply a \"50-50\" reasoning for all field directions\nto be stable.\nWhen it comes to stability with respect to the light degrees of freedom it is useful to\nconsult the results that were obtained directly in four-dimensional supergravity theories,\nwithout the concern of a higher-dimensional origin. Investigations on this mainly focus on\nextended gauged supergravities [31\u201338], and some on N = 1 supergravity [10, 28, 39, 40].\n16\n\n\fThese results indicate that in theories with N > 2 metastable solutions do not exist,\nwhile for theories with N \u2264 2 metastable solutions exist, but are not generic. For those\nmetastable examples for which the ten-dimensional origin seems understood the solutions\nare non-geometric [28], which is problematic since the supergravity limit might be invalid.\nThe known geometric examples [6,7] are solutions of four-dimensional N = 1 supergravity.\nAlthough the solutions are unstable, they do evade the known no-go theorems for stable\nde Sitter solutions in N = 1 supergravity [10, 39].\nFinally a word on directions that deserve further investigation. Obviously, it would be\ninteresting to find more explicit simple de Sitter solutions, in order to be able to understand\nhow generic unstable solutions are and whether meta-stable solutions can be found at all.\nWith the universal ansatz there is no reason to restrict to group and coset manifolds and\nwe can also look at non-homogeneous manifolds. One could also be interested in simple de\nSitter solutions in higher dimensions than four. In higher dimensions we expect less moduli\nand this simplifies the situation, and, for pure theoretical purposes de Sitter solutions in any\ndimension are of interest. Another way to obtain more classical de Sitter solutions would\nbe by looking at IIB supergravity. Recently it has been shown in reference [41] that moduli\nstabilisation at tree-level in IIB AdS vacua is possible as well, and more importantly, an\nunstable dS critical point of the effective potential was found. This opens up the interesting\npossibility of finding tree-level dS vacua in IIB.\nPerhaps a more pressing problem than stability is the issue of the backreaction of\nthe sources. Orientifolds are really localised objects and smearing them leads to lowerdimensional supergravity effective actions, but the consistency of smearing from a string\ntheory point of view has not been shown [42]. This issue arises for some of the AdS solutions\nas well, and it is important to sort it out.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe benefitted from useful discussions and ongoing collaboration with Shajid Haque, Gary\nShiu and Timm Wrase.
