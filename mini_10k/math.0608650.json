Krantz\n\nAbstract: We develop a new technique for studying the boundary limiting behavior of a holomorphic function on a domain \u03a9-both in one and several complex\nvariables. The approach involves two new localized maximal functions.\n\nAs a result of this methodology, theorems of Calder\u00f3n type about local boundary\nbehavior on a set of positive measure may be proved in a new and more natural way.\nWe also study the question of nontangential boundedness (on a set of positive\nmeasure) versus admissible boundedness. Under suitable hypotheses, these two\nconditions are shown to be equivalent.\n\n0 Introduction\nThe first theorem about the boundary limiting behavior of holomorphic functions\nwas proved by P. Fatou in his thesis in 1906 [FAT]. He used Fourier series techniques to show that if f is a bounded, holomorphic function on the unit disc DssC\n(i.e., f \u2208 H \u221e (D)), then\nlim\u2212 f (rei\u03b8 )\nr\u21921\n\nexists for almost every \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). Furthermore, for \u03b1 > 1 and P \u2208 \u2202D, we\ndefine\n\u0393\u03b1 (P ) = {\u03b6 \u2208 D : |z \u2212 P | < \u03b1(1 \u2212 |z|)} .\nThis is the nontangential or Stolz approach region. Then Fatou showed that, for\nf \u2208 H \u221e (D) and \u03b1 > 1 fixed, the limit\nlim\n\n\u0393\u03b1 (P )\u220bz\u2192P\n\nexists for almost every P \u2208 \u2202D.\n1\n\nf (z)\n\n\fLater on, Privalov [PRI1], [PRI2], Plessner [PLE], and others refined Fatou's\nresult (see [DIK] for a detailed account of the history). The standard theorem\ntoday is that, if 0 < p \u2264 \u221e, if \u03b1 > 1 is fixed, and if f \u2208 H p (D) (the Hardy\nspace), then\nlim\nf (z)\n\u0393\u03b1 (P )\u220bz\u2192P\n\nexists for almost every P \u2208 \u2202D. With suitable estimates for the Poisson kernel\n(see [KRA8]), one can prove a similar result (for nontangential convergence) on\nany bounded domain in C with C 2 boundary. The result may be refined further\nso that it is valid for functions in the Nevanlinna class (see [GAR] as well as our\nSection 9).\nA theorem of Littlewood (see [LIT]) shows that, in a very precise sense, the\nnontangential approach regions \u0393\u03b1 are the broadest approach regions through\nwhich a theorem of this kind can be obtained-even for bounded holomorphic\nfunctions.\nOn a bounded domain in Cn with C 2 boundary, it is classical that a holomorphic function satisfying suitable growth conditions-say membership in the\nHardy class H p or even the Nevanlinna class (see Section 9)-will have nontangential boundary limits almost everywhere with respect to (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional\narea measure d\u03c3 on the boundary. In the present context, \"nontangential\" means\nthrough an approach region of conical shape:\n\u0393\u03b1 (P ) = {z \u2208 \u03a9 : |z \u2212 P | < \u03b1 * \u03b4\u2202\u03a9 (P )} ,\nwith \u03b4\u2202\u03a9 (P ) denoting the Euclidean distance of P to \u2202\u03a9. Also, if \u03a9 = {z \u2208 Cn :\n\u03c1(z) < 0}, so that \u03c1 is a defining function for \u03a9 and if 0 < p < \u221e, then\np\n\nH (\u03a9) = {f on \u03a9 : sup\n\n0<\u01eb<\u01eb0\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03a9\u01eb\n\n|f (\u03b6)|p d\u03c3(\u03b6)1/p \u2261 kf kH p (\u03a9) < \u221e} .\n\nAlso H \u221e (\u03a9) consists of the bounded holomorphic functions with the supremum\nnorm. Here \u01eb0 is a small, positive number and \u03a9\u01eb \u2261 {z \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03c1(z) = \u2212\u01eb}. Details\nconnected with this definition may be found in [KRA1]. See [TSU], [ZYG1],\n[ZYG2], [ZYG3] for historical background of these ideas. The proof of such a\ntheorem depends once again on having the appropriate estimates for the Poisson\nkernel (see [KRA8], [KRA1]).\nIt came as quite a surprise when, in 1970, Adam Koranyi [KOR1], [KOR2]\nshowed that a broader method of approach than nontangential is valid when the\n\n2\n\n\fdomain in question is the unit ball in Cn . To wit, let B = {z \u2208 Cn : |z|2 < 1}.\nFor \u03b1 > 1 and P \u2208 \u2202B, define\nA\u03b1 (P ) = {z \u2208 B : |1 \u2212 z * P | < \u03b1(1 \u2212 |z|)} .\nP\n\nHere, as is standard, z * P \u2261 j zj P j . One may calculate (see [KRA1]) that\nthe approach region A\u03b1 has nontangential shape in complex normal directions\nbut parabolic shape in complex tangential directions. Koranyi's result is that, if\nf \u2208 H p (B), then\nlim\nf (z)\nA\u03b1 (P )\u220bz\u2192P\n\nexists for \u03c3-almost every P \u2208 \u2202B. Koranyi's proof depends decisively on an\nanalysis of the shape of the singularity of the Poisson-Szeg\u0151 kernel\nP(z, \u03b6) =\n\n(n \u2212 1)! (1 \u2212 |z|2 )n\n.\n2\u03c0 n |1 \u2212 z * \u03b6|2n\n\nfor the ball (which shape is decidedly different from the shape of the singularity for the classical Poisson kernel-see [KRA1], [KRA8]). Put in other words,\nwhere the classical results depend on estimates for the standard Poisson kernel\n(in particular, an analysis of its singularity), the new results of Koranyi required\nestimates on the Poisson-Szeg\u00f6 kernel.\nIn 1972, E. M. Stein [STE1] showed how to prove a result like Koranyi's on\nany domain in Cn with C 2 boundary. His analysis (later refined by Barker-see\n[BAR] and the discussion in [KRA1]) avoids the use of canonical kernels, but\ninstead depends on an analysis of the Levi geometry of the domain. See also\n[LEM] for a quite different and original approach to these matters.\nWe now realize that Stein's result was an important first step, but it is far\nfrom the optimal result for most domains. More precisely, the parabolic approach\nin complex tangential directions is really only suitable at strongly pseudoconvex\nboundary points. For points of finite type m, an approach region which has aperture Im z1 = |z \u2032 |m (where z1 is the complex normal direction and z \u2032 the remaining\ncomplex tangential directions-see the discussion below) is the right idea.1\nBut in fact the analysis is much more subtle than that, for it is not just the\ntype of the boundary point but the magnitude of that type that must play a role.\n1\n\nIt is instructive to examine the boundary behavior of a holomorphic function a point P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\nwhich is strongly pseudoconcave. By the Kontinuit\u00e4tssatz of multivariable complex function theory (or the Hartogs extension phenomenon), any holomorphic function on \u03a9 will continue analytically to an entire neighborhood of P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9. So the correct approach region at such a boundary\npoint will be unrestricted. This observation is quite different from the result of Koranyi/Stein.\n\n3\n\n\fThe type and the magnitude of the type depend semicontinuously on P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\nwhen \u03a9ssC2 . The dependence is more subtle for \u03a9ssCn , n > 2. The calculations\nin [NSW1], [NSW2] (see also [KRA9]) begin to show how to tame these rather\ncomplicated ideas.\nNow let us examine a slightly different direction of these studies. It is an old\nresult of A. P. Calder\u00f3n [CAL] that if a function u, harmonic on the upper half+1\n+1\nspace RN\n, is nontangentially bounded on a set EssRN \u2261 \u2202RN\nof positive\n+\n+\nN-dimensional measure then u has nontangential boundary limits at almost every point of E. In the important book [STE1], E. M. Stein proved an analogous\nresult for a holomorphic function on a strongly pseudoconvex domain \u03a9ssCn and\nfor admissible boundedness (see [KRA1] as well as the forthcoming [DIK] for\na discussion of both nontangential and admissible approach regions). Of course\nit is true that a holomorphic function on \u03a9ssCn that is nontangentially bounded\non a set Ess\u2202\u03a9 of positive (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional measure will have nontangential\nlimits almost everywhere on E-see [CAL], [STE1] and references therein. So\ncertainly a function that is admissibly bounded on a set Ess\u2202\u03a9 will have nontangential limits almost everywhere in E, just because admissible boundedness is a\nstronger condition than nontangential boundedness. One of the main points of the\npresent paper is to give a new proof of a fairly general version of the Calder\u00f3n theorem for admissible approach regions-one in which the admissible regions have\na geometry that is adapted to the particular domain under study (see Section 8).\nThus the result presented here is more general than that in [STE1] or [BAR]-just\nbecause the approach regions now fit the Levi geometry.\nOne of the main points of the present work is to make a comparison between\nnontangential behavior of holomorphic functions of several variables and admissible behavior. We prove the somewhat surprising result that if a holomorphic\nfunction on the ball B \u2286 Cn is nontangentially bounded almost everywhere on\na set E \u2286 \u2202B of positive measure then it is in fact admissibly bounded almost\neverywhere on E. Discussion, context, and proof appear below.\n\n1 Nontangential Boundary Behavior Versus\nAdmissible Boundary Behavior\nThere are a variety of results in the subject that link, or at least compare and\ncontrast, the isotropic behavior suggested by nontangential approach regions with\nthe nonisotropic behavior suggested by admissible approach regions. Perhaps the\n\n4\n\n\ffirst result of this kind was announced by Stein in [STE2]. The details of the\nargument appear in [KRA1]. The result states that a holomorphic function on\na smoothly bounded domain \u03a9 in Cn which is in a classical Lipschitz function\nspace is in fact in a stronger nonisotropic function space. Roughly speaking, such\na function is automatically twice as smooth in tangential directions. This result is\nin fact valid for all 0 < \u03b1 < \u221e. We now provide some of the concepts and details\npertaining to Stein's result.\nFor 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and \u03a9ssRN , we define\n\u039b\u03b1 (\u03a9) = {f : \u03a9 \u2192 C : |f (x + h) \u2212 f (x)| \u2264 C|h|\u03b1 for all x, x + h \u2208 \u03a9} .\nWe equip \u039b\u03b1 with the norm\nkf k\u039b\u03b1 = sup\n\nx,x+h\u2208\u03a9\nh6=0\n\n|f (x + h) \u2212 f (x)|\n+ kf kL\u221e (\u03a9) .\n|h|\u03b1\n\nIf \u03b1 = 1, then we use the slightly more subtle definition\n\u039b1 (\u03a9) = {f : \u03a9 \u2192 C : |f (x + h) + f (x \u2212 h) \u2212 2f (x)|\n\u2264 C|h| for all x, x + h, x \u2212 h \u2208 \u03a9} .\nWe equip \u039b1 with the norm\nkf k\u039b1 = sup\n\nx,x+h\u2208\u03a9\nx6=y\n\n|f (x + h) + f (x \u2212 h) \u2212 2f (x)|\n+ kf kL\u221e (\u03a9) .\n|h|\n\nInductively, if \u03b1 > 1, we say that f \u2208 \u039b\u03b1 (\u03a9) if f is continuously differentiable, f \u2208 \u039b\u03b1\u22121 , and \u2207f \u2208 \u039b\u03b1\u22121 . The norm is\nkf k\u039b\u03b1 = kf k\u039b\u03b1\u22121 (\u03a9) + k\u2207f k\u039b\u03b1\u22121 (\u03a9) .\nAssume that the domain \u03a9 has C 2 boundary. Let U be a tubular neighborhood\nof \u2202\u03a9 (see [HIR]). Thus each point in U has a unique nearest point in \u2202\u03a9 and\nthere is a well-defined Euclidean orthogonal projection \u03c0 : U \u2192 \u2202\u03a9. We say that\na C \u221e curve \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 \u03a9 \u2229 U lies in C 1 (\u03a9) if (i) |\u03b3\u0307(t)| \u2264 1 for all t and (ii) \u03b3\u0307(t)\nlies in the complex tangent space (see [KRA1]) at \u03c0(\u03b3(t)) for each t. We think of\nsuch a \u03b3 as a \"normalized complex tangential curve\". Let 0 < \u03b1 < \u221e. Following\nE. M. Stein [STE2], we set\n\u0393\u03b1,2\u03b1 (\u03a9) = {f \u2208 \u039b\u03b1 (\u03a9) : f \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2208 \u039b2\u03b1 ([0, 1]) for each \u03b3 \u2208 C 1 (\u03a9)} .\n5\n\n\fThus a function in \u0393\u03b1,2\u03b1 (\u03a9) is smooth of order \u039b\u03b1 in all directions, but smooth of\norder \u039b2\u03b1 in complex tangential directions.\nIn fact it is convenient to think about an f \u2208 \u0393\u03b1,2\u03b1 as a function that is \u039b\u03b1\nalong complex normal curves and is \u039b2\u03b1 along complex tangential curves. This\npoint of view has been developed, among other places, in [KRA3]\u2013[KRA6]. See\nalso [GRS] and [RUD].\nStein's remarkable theorem about these function spaces is as follows.\nTheorem 1 Let \u03a9ssCn be a domain with C 2 boundary. Let \u03b1 > 0. Let f be a\nholomorphic function on \u03a9 which lies in \u039b\u03b1 (\u03a9). Then f \u2208 \u0393\u03b1,2\u03b1 (\u03a9).\nThis result has been refined and generalized in [KRA3]\u2013[KRA6].\nIn [KRA2] it was shown that the analogous result for the space BMO of\nfunctions of bounded mean oscillation fails. To wit, if \u03a9 = BssCn is the unit ball,\nthen there are two types of balls to consider in the boundary \u2202B: If P \u2208 \u2202B and\nr > 0 then\n\u03b21 (P, r) = {z \u2208 \u2202B : |z \u2212 P | < r}\nand\n\u03b22 (P, r) = {z \u2208 \u2202B : |1 \u2212 z * P | < r} .\nNotice that \u03b21 is the standard, isotropic Euclidean ball whereas \u03b2\u221a2 is a nonisotropic\nball with extent r in the complex normal direction and extent r in the complex\ntangential directions.\nWe define\n(\n\nZ\n1\n|g(\u03b6) \u2212 g\u03b21 (z,r) | d\u03c3(\u03b6) < \u221e\nBMO1 (\u2202B) = g on \u2202B : sup\nz,r \u03c3(\u03b21 (z, r)) \u03b21 (z,r)\n\n)\n\n.\n\nHere d\u03c3 is (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure and gS denotes the average\nR\nof g over the set S: gS = [1/V (S)] * S g(t) dV (t). Likewise\n(\n\n1\nBMO2 (\u2202B) = g on \u2202B : sup\nz,r \u03c3(\u03b22 (z, r))\n\nZ\n\n\u03b22 (z,r)\n\n|g(\u03b6) \u2212 g\u03b22 (z,r) | d\u03c3(\u03b6) < \u221e\n\n)\n\nSay that g on the ball is in BMO1 (B) if f is holomorphic, f \u2208 H 2 , and\nf has boundary function that is in fact in BMO1 . Say that g on the ball is in\nBMO2 (B) if f is holomorphic, f \u2208 H 2 , and f has boundary function that is\nin fact in BMO2 . The result of [KRA2] is that there is a holomorphic function\non the ball in Cn which is in classical isotropic BMO1 but not in nonisotropic\n6\n\n.\n\n\fBMO2 . That proof used quite a lot of functional analysis, and did not exhibit\nthe counterexample explicitly. A more concrete proof, with an explicit example,\nwas given in [ULR]. The result of [KRA2] was particularly surprising because it\nshowed as a byproduct that BMO is not an interpolation space between Lp and\n\u039b\u03b1 .\nIn view of these results, it is natural to wonder whether a holomorphic function\non a domain \u03a9 in Cn that is nontangentially bounded almost everywhere on a set\nEss\u2202\u03a9 will in fact be admissibly bounded almost everywhere on E. If this were\ntrue, then it would follow, at least for a reasonable class of domains \u03a9, that a\nfunction that is nontangentially bounded on a set Ess\u2202\u03a9 of positive measure will\nin fact have admissible limits almost everywhere on E. In view of the Lindel\u00f6f\nprinciple developed in [CIK] and [KRA12], this is a very natural sort of result.\nAnd it turns out to be true. Its proof is one of the main results of the present paper.\n\n2 Definitions and Prior Results\nWe take this opportunity to review the standard definitions and concepts pertaining\nto this subject. The reference [KRA1] is a good source for the details. See also\n[KRA11].\nWe begin with harmonic analysis on RN +1 , which is the most natural setting\nfor the consideration of nontangential convergence. Define the upper half space\n+1\nU = RN\n= {x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN , xN +1 ) : xN +1 > 0} .\n+\n+1\nWe often shall write an element of RN\nas (x\u2032 , xN +1 ), where x\u2032 \u2208 RN and\n+\n+1\nxN +1 > 0. Of course the boundary of RN\ncan be identified with RN =\n+\n{(x1 , . . . , xN , 0)} in a natural way.\n+1\nIf \u03b1 > 1 and P \u2208 \u2202RN\n\u2261 RN , then we define the Stolz region or nontan+\ngential approach region \u0393\u03b1 (P) of aperture \u03b1 at P to be\n+1\n\u0393\u03b1 (P ) = {x = (x\u2032 , xN +1 ) \u2208 RN\n: |x\u2032 \u2212 P | < \u03b1xN +1 } .\n+\n\nThis is a conical-shaped region in the upper half space. Points in this region cannot\napproach the boundary along a tangential curve.\n+1\nLet f be a function on RN\n. We say that f is nontangentially bounded on a\n+\n+1\nN +1\n, there is an \u03b1 = \u03b1(P ) > 1 such that f |\u0393\u03b1 (P )\nset Ess\u2202R+ if, for each P \u2208 \u2202RN\n+\nis bounded. The bound, of course, may (and, in general, will) depend on P and on\n\u03b1. But observe that, if E has positive N-dimensional measure, then we may use\n7\n\n\felementary measure theory to find a set E \u2032 \u00dfE of positive measure and a constant\n\u03b1\u2032 > 1 and a number M \u2032 > 0 so that |f | \u2264 M \u2032 on \u0393\u03b1\u2032 (P \u2032) for each P \u2032 \u2208 E \u2032 . Thus\nwe may uniformize the estimate in the definition of \"nontangentially bounded\".\nWith notation as in the last paragraph, we say that f has nontangential limit\n+1\non the set Ess\u2202RN\nif, for each \u03b1 > 1, and each point P \u2208 E, the limit\n+\nlim\n\n\u0393\u03b1 (P )\u220bx\u2192P\n\nf (x)\n\nexists.2\nCalder\u00f3n's celebrated theorem [CAL] says this:\n+1\n+1\nTheorem 2 Let u be a harmonic function on RN\n. Let Ess\u2202RN\nhave posi+\n+\ntive N -dimensional measure. If u is nontangentially bounded on E , then u has\nnontangential limits almost everywhere on E .\n\nCalder\u00f3n notes in his paper that his result holds for holomorphic functions of\nseveral complex variables; but that more general result is also formulated in terms\nof classical nontangential convergence. See also [WID]. In fact the concept of\nadmissible convergence would not be invented for another twenty years.\nLet BssCn be the unit ball. Let f be a complex-valued function on B and let\nEss\u2202B. We say that f is admissibly bounded on E if, for each P \u2208 E, there is\nan \u03b1 = \u03b1(P ) > 1 such that f is bounded on A\u03b1 (P ). Using elementary measure\ntheory, it may be seen (in analogy with the situation for classical nontangential\nconvergence) that if Ess\u2202\u03a9 has positive (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional measure then there\nis a set E \u2032 \u00dfE of positive measure and a number \u03b1\u2032 > 1 and a constant M \u2032 > 0\nsuch that |f | is bounded by M \u2032 on A\u03b1\u2032 (P \u2032 ) for each P \u2032 \u2208 E \u2032 . See [STE1].\nWith notation as in the last paragraph, we say that f has admissible limit on\nthe set Ess\u2202\u03a9 if, for each \u03b1 > 1, and each point P \u2208 E, the limit\nlim\n\nA\u03b1 (P )\u220bz\u2192P\n\nf (z)\n\nexists.\nNow Stein's theorem [STE1, Theorem 12] states the following:\n2\n\nIt is worth noting that the definition of nontangentially bounded imposes on each P \u2208 E a\ncondition involving just one \u03b1, depending on P . But the definition of nontangential limit imposes\non each P \u2208 E a condition for all \u03b1.\n\n8\n\n\fTheorem 3 Let \u03a9ssCn be a strongly pseudoconvex domain with C 2 boundary (see\n[KRA1]). Let Ess\u2202\u03a9 be a set of positive (2n\u22121)-dimensional measure. Let f be a\nholomorphic function on \u03a9. Then f is admissibly bounded on almost everywhere\non E if and only if f has admissible limits at almost every point of E .\nThe proof of this last result that appears in [STE1] relies on the potential theory\nand the Levi geometry of the domain in question. In particular, it requires the\nconstruction of a special \"preferred\" Levi metric. It also depends on estimates\ninvolving the Lusin area integral; that is to say, the argument is not direct. S. Ross\nBarker [BAR] has provided an alternative, more measure-theoretic approach to\nthe matter and thereby proved the result to be true on a broad class of domains\n(and also avoided the use of the area integral). Barker only enunciates and proves\na result to the effect that a holomorphic function that is admissibly bounded almost\neverywhere (on the entire boundary) has then admissible limits almost everywhere\n(on the entire boundary). He comments at the end that his result can be localized\n(in the spirit of Calder\u00f3n). One of the points of the present paper is to provide a\nnew approach to the Calder\u00f3n result. We can also prove a sharper version of the\ntheorem, in the sense that we can in many cases adapt the shape of the approach\nregions to the Levi geometry of the particular domain under study (see Section 8).\n\n3 The Main Results of the Present Paper\nIn this section we collect the statements of the main results of the present paper.\nWe also briefly indicate their context and significance.\nRecall once again that, in the pioneering work [STE1], Stein proves theorems\nabout the boundary behavior of holomorphic functions using approach regions of\nthe same parabolic complex tangential geometry, no matter what the particular\nintrinsic complex geometry of the domain in question. It was only in later work\n(see [NSW1], [NSW2], [KRA9]) that the mathematical machinery was developed\nfor adapting the shape of the approach region to the Levi geometry of the domain.\nThe work in [DIB1], [DIB2], [DIB3] extends the new ideas further. It should\nbe stressed that the results presented in the present paper build on these ideas.\nFor instance, the paper [BAR] certainly extends Stein's version of the Calder\u00f3n\nlocal Fatou theorem to any smoothly bounded domain in Cn ; but it still used the\nold parabolic approach regions of Koranyi and Stein. In the present paper we\nprove a version of this theorem for several different types of domains; and we use\napproach regions that are specifically adapted to the geometry of the domain in\nquestion (see Sections 6, 8 for the details).\n9\n\n\fOur theorems do not apply to an arbitrary smoothly bounded domain in Cn . At\nthis stage in the development of our mathematical machinery they cannot. For all\nthe proofs here require (i) that the boundary of the domain be equipped with a system of balls that, together with standard (2n\u22121)-dimensional area measure, make\nthe boundary a space of homogeneous type in the sense of [COW1], [COW2] and\n(ii) the geometric structure of the approach regions A\u03b1 must be compatible (in a\nsense to be described in detail below) with the balls from (i). As of this writing,\nwe know how to carry out such a program on (a) strongly pseudoconvex domains,\n(b) domains of finite type in C2 , and (c) finite type, convex domains in Cn . Refer\nto Section 8 for the relevant geometric ideas.\nTheorem 4 Let \u03a9 be either a strongly pseudoconvex domain in Cn or a finite\ntype domain in C2 or a convex, finite type domain in Cn . Let Ess\u2202\u03a9 be a set of\npositive measure (either 3-dimensional Hausdorff measure for a domain in C2 or\n(2n \u2212 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure for a domain in Cn ). Suppose that f is\na holomorphic function on \u03a9. If f is admissibly bounded at almost every point of\nE then f has admissible limits at almost every point of E .\nDiscussion: In the strongly pseudoconvex case, Stein proves this theorem in\n[STE1, Theorem 12]. His proof proceeds by way of a Lusin area integral argument. We provide a new, more direct proof and also extend the result to finite\ntype domains in C2 and convex, finite type domains in Cn . We avoid the use of a\nspecial \"preferred\" metric and of the Lusin area integral and work more directly\nwith the Levi geometry of the domain. As part of our treatment of Theorem 4, we\nshall need to give a detailed consideration of approach regions for Fatou theorems\non domains of the type under discussion (Section 6). This is a subtle matter, for\nthe shape of the regions varies in a sort of semi-continuous manner with the base\nboundary point. Further details will also appear in Section 8 below.\nTheorem 5 Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit ball in Cn , n > 1. Let\nEss\u2202B be a set of positive (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional measure. Then f is nontangentially bounded at almost every point of E if and only if f is admissibly bounded\nat almost every point of E .\nCorollary 6 Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit ball in Cn , n > 1.\nLet Ess\u2202B be a set of positive (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional measure. Assume that f is\nnontangentially bounded at almost every point of E. Then f has admissible limits\nat almost every point of E.\n10\n\n\fDiscussion: In fact this result is valid in considerably greater generality. But all\nthe key ideas are already present in the ball case, and matters are clearer when\neverything may be written explicitly.\nIt should be stressed that Theorem 5 is not true point-by-point. That is to\nsay, at a particular point of the boundary of B it is not true that nontangential\nboundedness implies admissible boundedness. This circle of questions is closely\nrelated to the Lindel\u00f6f principle, for which see [CIK] and [KRA12].\nThe theorem answers a fairly old question, one that is rather natural in view\nof the discussion in Section 1. This new result puts the whole idea of admissible\nconvergence into a very natural context.\n\n4 An Ontology of Maximal Functions\nIn this paper we shall use eleven different maximal functions. For the convenience\nof the reader, we collect all their definitions here.\nWe begin by thinking about the most natural and classical setting for maximal\nfunctions, which is the Euclidean space RN . Let f be a locally integrable function\non RN . For x \u2208 RN we define\nMf (x) = sup\nr>0\n\n1\n|B(x, r)|\n\nand\nMf (x) = lim sup\nr\u21920+\n\nHere, as usual,\n\nZ\n\nB(x,r)\n\n1\n|B(x, r)|\n\n|f (t)| dt .\n\nZ\n\nB(x,r)\n\n|f (t)| dt .\n\n\u2022 The set B(x, r) is the standard isotropic Euclidean ball in RN with center x\nand radius r > 0.\n\u2022 We let |B(x, r)| denote the N-dimensional Lebesgue measure of B(x, r),\nwhich is cN r N .\n\u2022 The measure dt is the standard Lebesgue measure.\nIt is also useful to let\n1\nM\u03b4 f (P ) = sup\n0<r\u2264\u03b4 |B(x, r)|\n11\n\nZ\n\nB(x,r)\n\n|f (t)| dt .\n\n\fThe first maximal operator M is the classical one due to Hardy and Littlewood. The second M is our first new maximal operator. This maximal function\ndiffers from the classical one in that the supremum has been replaced by the limit\nsupremum. The third maximal operator M\u03b4 is another small modification of M,\nrestricting to balls of radius not exceeding \u03b4.\nNow let \u03a9ssCn be a domain on which a notion of admissible approach region\nA\u03b1 (P ), P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9, has been defined-see Section 8. If g is a complex-valued\nfunction on \u03a9 and P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 then we define\ng\u03b1\u2217 (P ) =\n\nsup |g(z)|\n\nz\u2208A\u03b1 (P )\n\nand\ng\u03b1\u2217\u2217 (P ) = lim sup |g(z)| .\nA\u03b1 (P )\u220bz\u2192P\n\nNow let BssCn be the unit ball. Of course \u2202B is equipped with a family of\nisotropic Euclidean balls\n\u03b21 (P, r) = {z \u2208 \u2202B : |z \u2212 P | < r} .\nWe shall also utilize the nonisotropic balls given by the condition\n\u03b22 (P, r) = {z \u2208 \u2202B : |1 \u2212 z * P | < r} .\nCorresponding to these two types of balls in \u2202B we shall have two types of\nmaximal functions. Let d\u03c3 be boundary area measure. If \u03c6 is a locally integrable\nfunction on \u2202B and P \u2208 \u2202B then we set\n\nand\n\n1\nM1 \u03c6(P ) = sup\nr>0 \u03c3(\u03b21 (P, r))\n\nZ\n\n|\u03c6(\u03b6)| d\u03c3(\u03b6)\n\n1\nM2 \u03c6(P ) = sup\nr>0 \u03c3(\u03b22 (P, r))\n\nZ\n\n|\u03c6(\u03b6)| d\u03c3(\u03b6) .\n\n\u03b21 (P,r)\n\n\u03b22 (P,r)\n\nWe also define two maximal functions based on the limsup rather than the supremum:\nZ\n1\n|\u03c6(t)| d\u03c3(t)\nM1 \u03c6(P ) = lim sup\nr\u21920+ |\u03b21 (P, r)| \u03b21 (P,r)\n\nand\n\nM2 \u03c6(P ) = lim sup\nr\u21920+\n\n1\n|\u03b22 (P, r)|\n12\n\nZ\n\n\u03b22 (P,r)\n\n|\u03c6(t)| d\u03c3(t) .\n\n\fIn addition, we shall have two sets of truncated maximal operators as follows:\nZ\n1\nM1,\u03b4 \u03c6(P ) = sup\n|\u03c6(\u03b6)| d\u03c3(\u03b6)\n0<r\u2264\u03b4 \u03c3(\u03b21 (P, r)) \u03b21 (P,r)\n\nand\n\n1\nM2,\u03b4 \u03c6(P ) = sup\n0<r\u2264\u03b4 \u03c3(\u03b22 (P, r))\n\nZ\n\n\u03b22 (P,r)\n\n|\u03c6(\u03b6)| d\u03c3(\u03b6) .\n\n5 Some Estimates for Maximal Functions\nIn this section we study some of our new maximal functions. These functions are\nrather natural tools for the study of the boundary behavior of holomorphic functions. Previous studies (see [STE1], [KRA1], [KRA9], [NSW1], [NSW2]) endeavored to study the entire boundary at once-using classical maximal functions\nthat were designed for such a purpose. Our goal here is to localize the process.\nThis change is particularly propitious for the development of results of Calder\u00f3n\ntype.\nProposition 7 The maximal operator M is of weak type (1, 1) and also of strong\ntype (p, p) for 1 < p \u2264 \u221e.\nProof: The classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal function M is known (see [STE3])\nto be of weak type (1, 1) and of strong type (p, p) for 1 < p \u2264 \u221e. Clearly\nMf (x) \u2264 Mf (x) for any f . The result follows.\nWe have formulated and proved Proposition 7 on RN . But the statement and\nproof transfer grosso modo to the boundary of a C 2 , bounded domain in RN or\nCN . After all, such a boundary is a smooth manifold hence is locally Euclidean.\nPut in different terms, this boundary is certainly a space of homogeneous type\n(see [COW1], [COW2]) when it is equipped with isotropic balls and the standard\nHausdorff measure on the boundary. Observe that, thus far, we are not taking\nthe complex structure or the Levi geometry into account. We are only looking at\nclassical Euclidean geometry.\nOur key tool in proving boundary limit theorems for holomorphic functions is\nas follows.\nTheorem 8 Let \u03a9 be a bounded domain in Cn , n \u2265 2, with C 2 boundary which\nis of one of these types:\n13\n\n\f\u2022 Strongly pseudoconvex domains in Cn ;\n\u2022 Finite type domains in C2 ;\n\u2022 Finite type, convex domains in Cn .\n\nLet u be a real-valued, nonnegative, plurisubharmonic function on \u03a9, continuous\non \u03a9. Let \u03c6 = u|\u2202\u03a9 be the boundary trace of u. Let P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 and \u03b1 > 1. Then\nu\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (P ) \u2264 C\u03b1 * M2 M1 \u03c6(P ) .\n\n(\u22c6)\n\nThis is our local version of Lemma 8.6.10 in [KRA1] or Theorem 2, p. 11,\nthe Lemma, p. 33, and Lemma 1b, p. 42 in [STE1]. It will be the key tool in\nobtaining a suitable version of Calder\u00f3n's theorem for domains in Cn . Note that\nthe maximal functions on the righthand side of (\u22c6) are the new localized maximal\nfunctions defined in terms of the limit supremum. Thus the are smaller than the\nmaximal functions in the classical inequalities of Stein and Barker.\nAs we know, once a result like Theorem 8 is established, then it is a straightforward exercise with measure theory to see that suitably bounded holomorphic\nfunctions have boundary limits. What is new here is the local nature of the maximal function estimate. This, coupled with the newly defined maximal functions,\nwill give a new way to think about Fatou-type theorems and Calder\u00f3n-type theorems even in C1 .\nWe note that Theorem 8 has of course a standard, classical formulation on the\nunit disc. In that context, we deal of course with nontangential convergence and\nthere is only one limsup-type maximal function M on the boundary (see [KRA1]).\nThe estimate then reads\n\u2032\u2032\nu\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (P ) \u2264 C Mu(P ) .\nHere we interpret u\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 on the left to be the limsup over \u0393\u03b1 (P ).\n\n6 Proof of Theorem 8 on the Disc and the Ball\nTo fix ideas, we will begin by proving Theorem 8 on the disc D in C. Now of\ncourse the correct concept is classical nontangential convergence, and the function\nu is subharmonic. Fix a point P \u2208 \u2202D. We may as well suppose that P = 1 + i0.\nFix a parameter \u03b1 > 1 and let z \u2208 \u0393\u03b1 (P ) be near the boundary. Let \u03b4 = 1 \u2212 |z|.\nFor a suitable c > 0, depending on \u03b1, we may be sure that D(z, c\u03b4)\u00dfD. Thus\nu(z) \u2264 C * M\u03b4 u(\u03c0(z)) ,\n14\n\n\fwhere \u03c0(z) = z/|z| is the standard Euclidean projection of z to \u2202D. See [KRA1,\nProposition 8.1.10] or [STE1] for the idea behind estimating u by the classical\nmaximal function on the boundary.\nIt is essential at this point to notice that the arc centered at \u03c0(z) and having\nradius c\u2032 \u03b4 will certainly contain P . This is because z \u2208 \u0393\u03b1 (P ). Note that c\u2032 =\nc\u2032 (\u03b1). Hence we may estimate the last line by\nu(z) \u2264 C \u2032\u2032 * Mc\u2032 \u03b4 u(P ) .\n\n(\u22c6\u22c6)\n\nSince we are now working on the unit disc D in C, we no longer have distinct\nmaximal functions (modeled on the limsup) based on either isotropic balls or nonisotropic balls. There is just the single limsup maximal function M based on arcs\nin \u2202D.\nNow choose a sequence zj \u2208 \u0393\u03b1 (P ) such that\nzj \u2192 P\n\nu(zj ) \u2192 lim sup u(z) \u2261 u\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (P ) .\n\nand\n\n\u0393\u03b1 (P )\u220bz\u2192P\n\nThen we know by (\u22c6\u22c6) that\nu(zj ) \u2264 C \u2032\u2032 * Mc\u2032 \u03b4j u(P ) ,\nHere \u03b4j = 1 \u2212 |zj |. Certainly, since zj \u2192 P , we know that \u03b4j \u2192 0. As j \u2192 \u221e,\nthe righthand side is certainly \u2264 C \u2032\u2032\u2032 * Mu(P ). We conclude therefore that\n\u2032\u2032\nu\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (P ) \u2264 C Mu(P ) .\n\nThat is the desired conclusion.\nNow let us turn to the situation on the ball BssCn . This circumstance is rather\nmore delicate, for we cannot pass directly from the interior to the boundary by\nway of single maximal function in order to get the estimates that we need. In the\nend, the estimate that we obtain is in terms of two maximal functions.\nThe nonisotropic balls mesh nicely with the admissible approach regions\nA\u03b1 (P ) = {z \u2208 B : |1 \u2212 z * P | < \u03b1(1 \u2212 |z|)} .\nNotice in particular that the set of points in A\u03b1 (P ) having distance precisely \u03b4 > 0\nfrom \u2202B can be described by\nE\u03b1 (\u03b4) = {z \u2208 B : \u03b4\u2202B (z) = \u03b4, |1 \u2212 z * P | < \u03b1 * \u03b4} .\n15\n\n\fThe projection of E\u03b1 (\u03b4) to \u2202B is the set\n{z \u2208 \u2202B : |1 \u2212 z * P | < \u03b1 * \u03b4} .\nThus we see in a natural way that the admissible approach region A\u03b1 (P ) is built\nup from the nonisotropic balls \u03b2(P, r) and, conversely, the nonisotropic balls are\nprojections of level sets of the approach regions A\u03b1 (P ). It is this relationship,\nbetween balls and approach regions, that we shall want to exploit when we study\nmore general domains.\nAnother key ingredient of our analysis on the unit ball in Cn is the existence of\ncertain polydiscs. If \u03b1 > 1 is fixed and P \u2208 \u2202B, then consider a point z \u2208 A\u03b1 (P ).\nIt is helpful to normalize coordinates so that Re z1 is the real normal direction at z\nand thus Im z1 is the complex normal direction. Thus z2 , . . . , zn span the complex\ntangential directions at z. If \u03b1\u2032 = 2\u03b1 then of course z \u2208 A\u03b1\u2032 (P ). Thus, letting\n\u03b4 = 1 \u2212 |z|, we see that the polydisc\nq\n\nq\n\nD = D(z) \u2261 D(z1 , \u03b4/2) \u00d7 D(z2 , , \u03b4/(2\u03b1)) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 D(z2 , , \u03b4/(2\u03b1))\nlies in A\u03b1\u2032 and hence in B.\nNow, as usual, let u be a nonnegative function that is continuous on B and\nplurisubharmonic on B. Certainly we have (iterating the sub-mean value property\non each coordinate disc in each dimension that makes up D)\n1 Z\nu(\u03b6) dV (\u03b6) .\nu(z) \u2264\n|D| D\n\n(\u2217)\n\nNow, in order to pass from the interior to the boundary, we must exploit our knowledge of the classical Poisson integral. Let us denote the Poisson kernel by P and\nthe Poisson integral of a boundary function f by P f . It follows from the maximum principle that the plurisubharmonic function u is majorized by the Poisson\nintegral P \u03c6 of its boundary function \u03c6. And that in turn is majorized by (see\n[KRA1, Chapter 8]) the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function M1 \u03c6 of \u03c6 at the\nprojected boundary point of the argument; but we in fact only need the HardyLittlewood maximal function based on balls of radius \u2264 \u03b4, and that we denote by\nM1,\u03b4 . Thus line (\u2217) is majorized by\n1\n|D|\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0(D)\n\nM1,\u03b4 \u03c6(\u03c0(\u03b6)) * \u03b4 d\u03c3(\u03b6) .\n\nHere, of course, \u03c0(z) = z/|z| is the projection of B \\ {0} to \u2202B and the extra \u03b4\nin the integrand comes from the real normal dimension of D.\n16\n\n\fNow it is essential to note that \u03c0(D) is comparable to a nonisotropic ball of\ncenter \u03c0(z) and radius c\u03b4. So we may rewrite our estimate as\nu(z) \u2264\n\nC\n\u03c3(\u03b2(\u03c0(z), c\u03b4)\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2(\u03c0(z),c\u03b4)\n\nM1,\u03b4 \u03c6(\u03b6) d\u03c3(\u03b6) .\n\nBecause the boundary is a space of homogeneous type-in particular the enveloping property is valid-we may replace the ball of radius c\u03b4 and centered at \u03c0(z)\nwith a ball of radius c\u2032 \u03b4 and centered at P . So we have\nC\u2032\nu(z) \u2264\n\u03c3(\u03b2(P, c\u2032\u03b4))\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2(P,c\u2032 \u03b4)\n\nM1,\u03b4 \u03c6(\u03b6) d\u03c3(\u03b6) .\n\nAnd this line is not greater than\nC \u2032 M2,\u03b4 (M1,\u03b4 \u03c6)(P ) ,\nwhere M2,\u03b4 is the Hardy-Littlewood-type maximal function modeled on the nonisotropic balls \u03b2 of radius not exceeding \u03b4. Now choose a sequence zj \u2208 A\u03b1 (P )\nsuch that u(zj ) \u2192 lim supz\u2192P u(z). Then of course\nu(zj ) \u2264 C \u2032 M2,\u03b4j (M1,\u03b4j \u03c6)(P ) .\nLetting j \u2192 \u221e, we find that\n\u2032\nu\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (P ) \u2264 C * M2 M1 \u03c6(P ) .\n\nOf course the maximal functions Mj on the right denotes the \"limsup\" maximal\nfunction that we defined and considered earlier. Thus we have obtained the desired estimate.\nWe have only presented the proof of Theorem 8 so far on the unit ball B in\nCn . But we assert that it is valid on more general classes of domains, as we have\nindicated above. In Section 8 we isolate those geometric properties that are needed\nin order to see that the result goes through in the claimed greater generality.\n\n7 The (Localized) Calder\u00f3n Theorem\nNow we shall present our new approach to the Calder\u00f3n theorem. To repeat, this\npoint of view is new even in the classical setting of the unit disc in C. We shall\nconfine our discussion to the unit ball, where all the key ideas are already clear.\n17\n\n\fProposition 9 Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit ball BssCn . Let M > 0\nand suppose that |f | \u2264 M . Let Ess\u2202B be a set of positive measure, and supposed\nthat f is admissibly bounded on E . Then f has admissible limits at almost every\npoint of E .\nRemark: The tauberian condition |f | \u2264 M is a bit artificial, and is certainly\nnot part of the standard canon of the Calder\u00f3n theorem. But it is a useful tool\nin our proof. Afterward, we shall remove this condition and recover the standard\nCalder\u00f3n result.\nProof: Let \u03c3 be the usual rotationally-invariant (2n\u22121)-dimensional area measure\non \u2202B. Let \u01eb > 0. By outer regularity, select an open set Uss\u2202B such that U \u2287 E\nand \u03c3(U \\ E) \u2264 \u01eb * \u03c3(E). We shall use the maximal functions, and the attendant\nnotation, that we introduced earlier in Section 4.\nAs usual, if u is a plurisubharmonic function on B, continuous on B, and if \u03c6\nis the boundary trace of u, then we know for each P \u2208 \u2202B that\nu\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (P ) \u2264 C\u03b1 M2 M1 \u03c6(P ) .\nFix a point P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 and let \u03bd = \u03bdP be the unit outward normal vector at P .\nFollowing the classical argument presented in [KRA1, Theorem 8.6.11], we apply\nthis last inequality to the function\n!\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\nfj,k (z) = f z \u2212 \u03bdz \u2212 f z \u2212 \u03bdz\nj\nk\n\n\u0013\n\nfor some j, k positive integers. Then of course fj,k is plurisubharmonic. If we\ne\ne is a neighborhood\nrestrict attention to f and fj,k on a neighborhood \u03a9\u2229\u03a9,\nwhere \u03a9\ne \u2229 \u03a9. Following the\nin Cn of P , then we may also take fj,k to be continuous on \u03a9\nargument in the proof of Theorem 8.6.10 in [KRA1], we know that\nZ\n\nE\n\n2\n|(fj,k )\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (\u03b6)| d\u03c3(\u03b6)\n\n\u2264 C\u03b1 *\n\nZ\n\nU\n\nM2 (M1 fj,k (\u03b6))2 d\u03c3(\u03b6) .\n\nIt is important to note that the maximal functions on the right are defined using\nthe limsup. Thus we may say not only that each maximal function is bounded on\nL2 , but also that it is bounded from L2 of any open set Ue containing U to L2 of\nU-just because the boundedness would be proved using arbitrarily small balls.\nSo we obtain\nZ\n\nE\n\n2\n|(fj,k )\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 (\u03b6)| d\u03c3(\u03b6)\n\n\u2264\n18\n\nC\u03b1\u2032\u2032\n\nZ\n\ne\nU\n\n|fj,k (\u03b6)|2 d\u03c3(\u03b6) ,\n\n\fwhere Ue is an open set in \u2202B that contains U and such that \u03c3(Ue \\ E) < \u01eb * \u03c3(E).\nLetting j \u2192 \u221e as in (8.6.10.2) of [KRA1], we find that\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n1\nlim sup (f (\u03b6) \u2212 f z \u2212 \u03bd\nk\nE A\u03b1 (\u03b6)\u220bz\u2192\u03b6\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b6) \u2264\n\nC\u03b1\u2032\u2032\n\nZ\n\ne\nU\n\nfe(\u03b6) \u2212 f\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03b6\u2212 \u03bd\nk\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b6) .\n\nHere fe(\u03b6) denotes the nontangential limit of f at almost every point of E, which\nwe know exists a fortiori by Calder\u00f3n's classical result.\nNow of course the trick (on the righthand side) is to write Ue = (Ue \\ E) \u222a E.\nThus\nZ\nZ\nRHS =\n+ \u2261 I + II .\ne\\E\nU\n\nE\n\nThe first integral is estimated quite simply by 4M 2 * \u03c3(Ue \\ E) \u2264 C * \u01eb\u03c3(E). Here,\nof course C depends on \u03b1 and on M. But it does not depend on any of the other\nparameters that are relevant to our present estimations. In fact if we replace \u01eb by\n\u01eb/M 2 , then we may remove the dependence on M. This will be important later.\nSo we have\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nlim sup (f (\u03b6) \u2212 f z \u2212 \u03bd\nk\nE A\u03b1 (\u03b6)\u220bz\u2192\u03b6\n\u2264\n\nC\u03b1\u2032\u2032\n\nZ\n\nE\n\ne\nf(\u03b6)\n\u2212f\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03b6\u2212 \u03bd\nk\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b6)\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b6) + C\u01eb\u03c3(E) .\n\n(\u2217)\n\nAnd now one can proceed to imitate the argument at the end of the proof of\nTheorem 8.6.10 in [KRA1] to find that\n(\n\n\u03c3 \u03b6 \u2208 E : lim sup\n\nA\u03b1 (\u03b6)\u220bz\u2192\u03b6\n\ne\n|f (z) \u2212 f(\u03b6)|\n\n)\n\n> \u01eb \u2264 C * \u01eb * \u03c3(E) .\n\nWe conclude the argument with standard reasoning using elementary measure theory to see that limA\u03b1 (\u03b6)\u220bz\u2192\u03b6 f (z) = fe(\u03b6).\n\nOur next job is to remove the tauberian hypothesis (i.e., the assumption of a\nglobal bound by M).\n\nTheorem 10 Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit ball BssCn . Let Ess\u2202B\nbe a set of positive measure, and supposed that f is admissibly bounded almost\neverywhere on E . Then f has admissible limits at almost every point of E .\n19\n\n\fProof: For \u03b4 > 0 small, let B\u03b4 \u2261 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u03b4) \u2286 B \u2286 Cn . For each such \u03b4 > 0\nthere is of course a bound M\u03b4 so that |f | \u2264 M\u03b4 on B\u03b4 . If E is as in the statement\nof the theorem, let E\u03b4 be its Euclidean orthogonal projection into \u2202B\u03b4 . Fix \u01eb > 0\nas before. Choose Ue\u03b4 \u2283 E\u03b4 so that \u03c3(Ue\u03b4 \\ E) < [\u01eb/M\u03b42 ] * \u03c3(E). Then the estimate\n(\u2217) holds on B\u03b4 with E\u03b4 replacing E (and, implicitly, Ue\u03b4 replacing Ue ). Now taking\nthe supremum over \u03b4 > 0, we find that\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nlim sup (f (\u03b6) \u2212 f z \u2212 \u03bd\nk\nE A\u03b1 (\u03b6)\u220bz\u2192\u03b6\n\u2264\n\nC\u03b1\u2032\u2032\n\nZ\n\nE\n\ne\nf(\u03b6)\n\u2212f\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03b6\u2212 \u03bd\nk\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b6)\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b6) + C\u01eb\u03c3(E) .\n\nAnd now the proof may be completed as in the argument for the last theorem.\nA retrospective of the proof just presented shows that we have constructed machinery that allows a standard sort of localization of the classical Fatou theorem.\nIf the ingredients are in place to prove Theorem 8, then the Calder\u00f3n theorem\nfollows immediately. Section 8 explains how all these ingredients are present on\ndomains other than the unit ball B.\n\n8 Ingredients Needed for a Proof on a General Domain\nAt this time we do not know how to prove the results considered here on a perfectly arbitrary bounded domain in Cn with C 2 boundary. In fact our reasoning\ndepends in essential ways (as does the reasoning of Stein and others) on the Levi\ngeometry of the domain. The pertinent desiderata are in fact known to hold on\n(i) the unit disc in C;\n(ii) the unit ball in Cn ;\n(iii) strongly pseudoconvex domains in Cn ;\n(iv) domains of finite type in C2 ;\n(v) convex domains of finite type in Cn , n \u2265 2.\n\n20\n\n\fWe take this opportunity to isolate the essential features of the geometry that\nare needed for our reasoning, and give references where the reader may verify\nthat these domains do indeed have the required properties. Fix a bounded domain\n\u03a9ssCn with C 2 boundary.\n(a) The boundary \u2202\u03a9 must be equipped with a family of balls \u03b22 (P, r). We use\nthe notation \u03b21 (P, r) to denote the standard, isotropic, Euclidean balls with\ncenter P and radius r. The ball \u03b22 (P, r) will typically be nonisotropic and\nits shape will derive rather naturally from the complex structure and/or the\nLevi geometry of \u03a9.\n(b) On the boundary of a suitable domain in Cn , the balls \u03b22 (P, r), together\nwith the standard (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional Hausdorff area measure d\u03c3, form\na space of homogeneous type in the sense of [COW1], [COW2]. Of course\nthe classical Euclidean balls \u03b21 (P, r) together with d\u03c3 also form a space of\nhomogeneous type.\n(c) The domain \u03a9 is equipped with a family of approach regions A\u03b1 (P ) for\neach P \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 and each \u03b1 > 1. Each A\u03b1 (P ) is an open set in \u03a9, and\nA\u03b1 (P ) \u2286 A\u03b1\u2032 (P ) whenever \u03b1\u2032 > \u03b1.\n(d) The approach regions A\u03b1 (P ) and the balls \u03b22 (P, r) are related in the following manner. If \u03b1 > 1 is fixed and \u03b4 > 0 is small then the Euclidean\northogonal projection of\n{z \u2208 A\u03b1 (P ) : \u03b4\u2202\u03a9 (z) = \u03b4}\nto \u2202\u03a9 is comparable to a ball \u03b22 (P, c\u03b4). Here, of course, c will depend on\n\u03b1. Conversely, the set\n[\n\n\u03b4>0\n\n{z \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03c0(z) \u2208 \u03b22 (P, \u03b4), \u03b4\u2202\u03a9 (z) = \u03b4}\n\nis comparable to an approach region Ac\u03b4 (P ).\n(e) Suppose, after a normalization of coordinates, that Re z1 is the real normal\ndirection at z, Im z1 the complex normal direction, and z2 , . . . , zn form an\northonormal basis for the remaining (n \u2212 1) complex tangential directions.\nThere is a c > 0 with the following property. If \u03b1 > 1 is fixed and z \u2208\n\n21\n\n\fA\u03b1 (P ) with \u03b4 = \u03b4\u2202\u03a9 (z) then there are positive exponents \u03bb1 = \u03bb1 (z), . . . ,\n\u03bbn\u22121 = \u03bbn\u22121 (z) so that the polydisc\nD(z) \u2261 D(z1 , c\u03b4) \u00d7 D(z2 , c\u03b4 \u03bb1 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 D(zn , c\u03b4 \u03bbn\u22121 )\nstill lies in \u03a9.\n(f) A critical property of the polydisc D(z) in part (e) is that the Euclidean\northogonal projection \u03c0(D(z)) in \u2202\u03a9 is comparable to a nonisotropic ball\n\u03b22 (\u03c0(z), c\u2032 \u03b4). What is crucial here is that \u03b4 will be the size of this ball in\nthe complex normal direction, and that will automatically determine all the\nother dimensions of the (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional ball.\n(g) The ball \u03b22 (\u03c0(z), c\u2032 \u03b4) from part (f) is comparable to a ball \u03b22 (P, c\u2032\u2032 \u03b4), where\nP is as in part (e).\nA review of the proofs that we have presented in Sections 5, 6, 7 show that\nthese seven properties are precisely those that we used to establish our results.\nThus Theorem 4 is true for the five types of domains described in (i)\u2013(v).\nThe references for properties (a)\u2013(g) on domains (i)\u2013(iv) are\n(i) For the disc, see [KRA1].\n(ii) For the ball, see [KRA11], [KRA1], [STE1].\n(iii) For strongly pseudoconvex domains in Cn , see [KRA1], [STE1], [KRL].\n(iv) For finite type domains in C2 , see [NSW1], [NSW2], [NRSW], [CAT].\n(v) For convex, finite type domains in Cn , see [DIF], [MCN1], [MCN2] and\nreferences therein.\n\n9 The Nevanlinna Class\nFor many purposes, the most natural space of functions on which to consider\nFatou-type theorems is the Nevanlinna class. Here, for a fixed bounded domain\n\u03a9ssCn with C 2 boundary, we say that f on \u03a9 lies in N + if (i) f is holomorphic\nand (ii) log+ |f | has a harmonic majorant. By a standard lemma that can be found\nin [STE1] or [KRA1], this definition is equivalent to requiring that\nsup\n0<\u01eb<\u01eb0\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03a9\u01eb\n\nlog+ |f (\u03b6)| d\u03c3(\u03b6) < \u221e .\n22\n\n\fHere \u03a9\u01eb = {z \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03c1(z) = \u2212\u01eb} for some defining function \u03c1 for \u03a9 (see [KRA1])\nand\n(\n0\nif x \u2264 1\n+\nlog x =\nlog x if x > 1 .\nStein's book [STE1] contained rather elaborate and technical arguments to\nhandle the boundary behavior of functions in N + . A few years later, Barker\n[BAR] provided a much simpler approach. His key ideas was the next lemma.\nNote also that the case of meromorphic functions in the Nevanlinna class was\ntreated by Neff [NEF1], [NEF2] and Lempert [LEM].\nLemma 11 Let u be a nonnegative, continuous, plurisubharmonic function on \u03a9\n(we do not necessarily mandate that u be continuous on \u03a9). Assume that u has a\nharmonic majorant.

It follows then that u\u2217\u2217\n\u03b1 is finite almost everywhere, and we\nmay then use our standard arguments to see that f has an admissible limit almost\neverywhere. Thus we have\nTheorem 12 Let \u03a9ssCn , n \u2265 2, be a bounded domain with C 2 boundary. Assume\nthat either \u03a9 is the ball, or a finite type domain in C2 , or a convex finite type\ndomain in Cn . Suppose that f \u2208 N + (\u03a9). Then f has admissible boundary limits\nalmost everywhere.\n23\n\n\f10 Nontangential Versus Admissible Approach\nNow we shall prove Theorem 5. In fact, following the example that we have\nalready set with our proof of Theorem 4 (see Proposition 9), we shall at first prove\na version of the theorem that has an additional tauberian hypothesis.\nTheorem 13 Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit ball B in Cn , n > 1.\nAssume that there is a constant M > 0 so that |f | \u2264 M . Let Ess\u2202B be a set\nof positive (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional measure. Then f is nontangentially bounded at\nalmost every point of E (with a bound C that is in general, and most interestingly,\nsmaller than M ) if and only if f is admissibly bounded (with the same bound C )\nat almost every point of E .\nAs enunciated, we shall work on the domain the ball B, and for simplicity\nand clarity we shall restrict attention to BssC2 . Thus assume that the holomorphic function f on B is nontangentially bounded on the set Ess\u2202B of positive\n3-dimensional Hausdorff measure. As usual we call the measure d\u03c3.\nWith elementary measure-theoretic arguments, we may extract from E a subset of positive measure so that f is nontangentially bounded at each point of the\nsubset with a uniform bound C and on a cone \u0393\u03b1 of uniform size-independent of\nthe point. We continue to call this new set E. Not that, in general, C < M-that\nis certainly the most interesting case. We shall show then that f is admissibly\nbounded with bound C.\nNow let P \u2208 \u2202B be a point of density (with respect to classical, isotropic\nballs) of Ess\u2202B, and let Uss\u2202B be a small, relatively open neighborhood of P .\nLet us consider a foliation of U by complex tangential curves. Call the curves\n\u03b3w : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 U, where w is a 2-dimensional parameter. Let gw denote the\nimage curve of \u03b3w . Restrict attention now to those gw which intersect E in a set\nof positive 1-dimensional measure. For each such gw , pick a point \u03b3w (tw ) that is\na point of 1-dimensional density of gw \u2229 E. Let \u01eb > 0. Choose a neighborhood\nIw = (tw \u2212 \u03b4w , tw + \u03b7w ) so that\nH1 (\u03b3w (Iw ) \u2229 E)\n> 1 \u2212 \u01eb.\nH1 (Iw )\nWe may suppose that tw , \u03b4w , \u03b7w are rational numbers. Now, with some elementary\nmeasure theory, we may focus on a collection of \u03b3w , w in a 2-dimensional set of\npositive measure, so that each of the Iw is the same interval I \u2217 . Give this set of w\n24\n\n\fthe name S, and let s \u2208 S be a 2-dimensional point of density. We fix attention\non the point x0 = \u03b3s (ts ).\nWe may repeat the preceding arguments using a foliation \u03b3ew of U that is still\ncomplex tangential but is transverse to \u03b3w (remember that we are working in the\nboundary of the ball B in C2 , so the complex tangent space has real dimension 2).\ne By elementary measure theory-in particular by\nThis gives rise to a point se \u2208 S.\nFubini's theorem-we may suppose that x0 = \u03b3s (ts ) = \u03b3es\u0303 (tes\u0303 ) = xe0 . We continue\nto call the point x0 .\nThus we focus our attention on the curves \u03b3w (I \u2217 ) for w \u2208 S and \u03b3ewe(Ie\u2217 ) for\ne We examine an admissible approach region with base point x as above.\nwe \u2208 S.\n0\nCall that region A\u03b1 (x0 ), some \u03b1 > 1. Let z \u2208 A\u03b1 (x0 ) be near to the boundary-\nat distance much less than the length of Ie or Ie\u2217 . Let \u03b4 = \u03b4\u2202B (z). Now consider, as\nusual, a nonisotropic polydisc\u221aD centered at z, having radius c\u2032 \u03b4 in the complex\nnormal directions and radii c\u2032 \u03b4 in the complex tangential directions, some small\nc\u2032 > 0.\nThe natural thing to do at this point is to estimate\n1\n|f (z)| \u2264\n|D|\n\nZ\n\nD\n\n|f (\u03b6)| dV (\u03b6) .\n\nBecause of our density statements about Ie and S, we can estimate this last line by\n(1 \u2212 c\u2032\u2032 \u01eb)C + c\u2032\u2032 \u01eb * M .\n\nSince the point z \u2208 A\u03b1 (s) was chosen arbitrarily, and since \u01eb > 0 was arbitrary,\nwe in fact have shown that f is admissibly bounded at x0 with bound C. Since\npoints of the kind x0 are measure-theoretically generic, we now know that we\nhave a set of positive measure in E on which f is admissibly bounded. Again, by\nelementary measure theory, we may then conclude that f is admissibly bounded\nat almost all points of E. That completes the proof.\nIt remains to show that our result holds without the tauberian hypothesis |f | \u2264\nM. So now let f be nontangentially bounded on a set Ess\u2202B of positive measure.\nAs usual, we may take the nontangential approach regions \u0393\u03b1 (P ) to be of uniform\naperture, and the bound C to be uniform.\nFor \u03c4 > 0 small, let B\u03c4 = B(0, 1 \u2212 \u03c4 ). Then of course f is bounded by\nsome M\u03c4 on B\u03c4 . Let E\u03c4 be the projection of E to \u2202B\u03c4 . Then of course f is\nnontangentially bounded on E\u03c4 by C (because each approach region A\u03c4\u03b1 (P\u03c4 ) \u2286\nB\u03c4 for P\u03c4 \u2208 E\u03c4 is a subset of A\u03b1 (P ), where P = \u03c0(P\u03c4 )). Since the tauberian\n25\n\n\fhypothesis is in place on B\u03c4 , we may conclude that f is admissibly bounded by C\non E\u03c4 . But now, for each P \u2208 E, note that\nA\u03b1 (P ) =\n\n[\n\n\u03c4 >0 small\n\nA\u03c4\u03b1 (P\u03c4 )\n\nwhere A\u03c4\u03b1 (T\u03c4 ) is the admissible region in B\u03c4 based at the point P\u03c4 (the projection\nof P to \u2202B\u03c4 ). Since f is admissibly bounded by C on each of the approach regions\non the right, it follows that f is bounded by C on A\u03b1 (P ). This reasoning is valid\nat almost every point P of E. The proof is therefore complete.\n\n11 Concluding Remarks\nThe results in this paper are formulated and proved on the ball, on strongly pseudoconvex domains, on finite type domains in C2 , and on convex, finite type domains\nin Cn . Other types of domains can be handled with ad hoc arguments. Among\nthose are the bidisc and complete Reinhardt domains like\n2\n\n\u03a92,\u221e = {z \u2208 C2 : |z1 |2 + 2e\u22121/|z2 | < 1} .\nA complete theory of Fatou theorems and Calder\u00f3n theorems, which can treat any\nbounded C 2 domain and which fully accounts for its attendant Levi geometry, has\nyet to be produced. The paper [KRA9] offers a conceptual framework for handling\nall domains-using the Kobayashi metric as a stepping stone and structural tool-\nbut in practice it is rather difficult to verify all the hypotheses of the results in\n[KRA9].\nWe are of the opinion, however, that invariant metrics are the right argot for\nformulating function theoretic problems and results on arbitrary domains. Such\nmetrics can read the Levi geometry, and they also take into account the way that\nholomorphic functions in the interior depend on the shape of the domain. We look\nforward to future work in this direction.\n\n26\n\n\fR EFERENCES\n[BAR] S. R. Barker, Two theorems on boundary values of analytic functions, Proc.\nAm. Math.
