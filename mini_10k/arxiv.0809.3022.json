This work, further elaborated by Wheeler and his collaborators in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] provided an intriguing\nalternative to the introduction of fundamental matter fields in quantum theories that include\ngravity. The early study of geons emphasized the analysis of asymptotically flat spacetimes\ncontaining soliton-like gravitating electromagnetic fields with simple topology R3 ; however\ninitial data for geons with nontrivial topology was also exhibited, mainly in the context of\nthe production of nontrivial electric charge. Though conceptually appealing, technical problems were discovered that reduced interest, namely that asymptotically flat geons on R3\nwith no horizons were unstable on short timescales; the solitonic-like configurations tended\neither to collapse to a black hole or disperse. In addition, early topological geons exhibited the unpleasing property that both electric and magnetic charges could be produced by\nthreading the topological structure with the appropriate electromagnetic field. Thus these\ngeons yielded no selection rule for the observed absence of magnetic monopoles. However\nin 1979, Sorkin showed that a geon with the topology of a non-orientable handle did not\nexhibit this flaw [7]; it produced only one kind of monopole charge, which could be taken as\nthe electric charge. Soon after, Friedman and Sorkin gave an interesting formal argument\nthat the inclusion of topological geons in 4-dimensional quantum gravity resulted in spin\n1/2 quantum states with no fermionic matter sources [8, 9]. These two arguments renewed\ninterest in the role of geons, in particular those with nontrivial topology, as quantum particles in 4-dimensional quantum gravity [10]. Henceforth, the term geon will refer to ones\nwith nontrivial topological structure.\nFurther work elaborated key features of geons in classical general relativity. The detailed\nconditions for the formal existence of spin 1/2 states from geons and interesting ties to\nthe topology of 3-manifolds were given in a series of papers by Friedman and Witt [11,\n12, 13, 14].1 In addition, Witt showed that physically reasonable initial data sets for the\nEinstein equations can be constructed on all smooth 3-manifolds [15]. Thus any quantum\n1\n\nThese results also yielded counter-examples to some conjectures in 3-dimensional topology.\n\n2\n\n\fgeon in 4-dimensional quantum gravity will yield a classical geon in the correspondence\nlimit. This analysis of geons in classical relativity laid the foundation for further formal\nstudy of geons in 4-dimensional quantum gravity, in particular the study of the applicability\nof spin-statistics to quantum geons [10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. These formal results on spin 1/2\nquantum states of geons and their spin-statistics are generic in the sense that they apply in\nany theory of quantum gravity in which the rotation operators can be defined at asymptotic\ninfinity. Nonetheless, no concrete application of these results in a quantum setting can be\ninvestigated as no complete theory of quantum gravity in 4-dimensions is known. Therefore,\norder to gain a better understanding of the physics of quantum geons, it would be useful to\nhave an analogous, well defined quantum arena to be able to investigate their properties in.\nA natural starting point for such an investigation is 2 + 1-dimensional quantum gravity.\nTwenty years ago, it was pointed out by Witten that 2 + 1-dimensional quantum gravity\nwas exactly solvable [21]. By working on the space of solutions, quantum amplitudes for\n2+1 gravity with closed spatial topologies could be formulated in terms of finite dimensional\nquantum mechanics. Thus problems such as the nonrenormalizability of quantum gravity in\nmore than two dimensions associated with traditional approaches based on quantization on\ninfinite dimensional configuration space could be avoided. This result led to a renaissance\nof research in Chern-Simons theories and topological field theories in three and more dimensions, mainly concentrating on the flat, closed universe case (See [22] and [23] for an overview\nof this large set of results). Indeed, this work spurred the investigation of formal properties\nof 2 + 1-dimensional geons such as spin [24] and a generalized spin statistics theorem for the\ngeons in 2 + 1-dimensional quantum gravity [25] based on the assumption that quantization\nof closed, flat universes could be extended to the open case.\nRecently, there has been renewed interest in 2 + 1-dimensional gravity; Witten pointed\nout certain issues are more subtle in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter case and should be\nrevisited, a case not considered in detail in the first era of work [26]. This suggestion has\nresulted in a resurgence of work in 2 + 1-dimensional quantum gravity in the context of\n2 + 1-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes and related 2 + 1-dimensional theories such\nas topologically massive gravity [27, 28] and chiral gravity [29]. These 2 + 1-dimensional\nquantum gravity models explicitly exhibit asymptotic regions. Therefore they provide a\nnatural forum in which it may be possible to extend formal results on geons and other such\nstructures more rigorously to the quantum realm.\n3\n\n\fIdentification of classical 2 + 1-dimensional geons is a key starting point for the study of\nquantum geons; it allows identification of formal results on the spin and charge of geons to\ntheir quantum counterparts. Furthermore, if such classical geons exist, then so should their\nquantum counterparts by the correspondence principle. This paper will address this key\nquestion; are there geons with nontrivial topology in classical 2 + 1 gravity? We will prove\nthat, in contrast to the 3+1-dimensional case, there are no asymptotically flat solutions to the\n2+1-dimensional vacuum Einstein or Einstein-Maxwell equations that contain geons. Hence\nit is unclear how to relate formal results on 2 + 1 geons to quantum ones for asymptotically\nflat spacetimes. On the other hand, geons and other spacetimes with nontrivial topology\ndo exist in 2 + 1-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes [30, 31, 32]. Hence these\nspacetimes would seem to provide a more natural starting point for the study of 2 + 1 geons.\nIn Section II, we summarize basic definitions needed in the proof of our results. In Section\nIII, we prove a contradiction to the existence of an outer trapped surface for asymptotically\nflat 2 + 1-dimensional solutions to the vacuum Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations and\nprovide sufficient conditions for the non-existence of an outer trapped surface for spacetimes\nwith zero cosmological constant that satisfy the dominant energy condition. We begin with\na proof of a result of Ida [33] on the nonexistence of trapped surfaces in spacetimes with\npositive cosmological constant. We then fix a gap in the extension of Ida's result to the case\nof zero cosmological constant by first proving that there exist no trapped surfaces in this case\nif the spacetime is analytic. We conclude by showing that 2 + 1-dimensional Einstein spaces\nare indeed analytic. In Section IV we prove our main result. First, topological rigidity, a\nconsequence of topological censorship [34, 35, 36], is used to prove the existence of a horizon\nfor both the asymptotically flat and asymptotically anti-de Sitter geons. We then prove that\nasymptotically flat geon spacetimes must contain an outer trapped surface. We then use the\nresults of Section III to prove a contradiction to the existence of a horizon for asymptotically\nflat spacetimes of nontrivial topology for the vacuum and Einstein-Maxwell cases. Finally\nwe note that, in contrast, asymptotically AdS spacetimes admit an outer trapped surface\nand thus there is no contradiction. Hence geons exist in 2 + 1-dimensional asymptotically\nAdS spacetimes.\n\n4\n\n\fII.\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n\nWe begin by recalling some basic definitions from general relativity needed in the statement and proof of the theorems.\nA spacetime satisfies the null energy condition (NEC) if Rab W a W b \u2265 0 for all null W a ,\nthe weak energy condition (WEC) if Tab W a W b \u2265 0 for all timelike W a and the dominant\nenergy condition (DEC) if the WEC holds and Tab W b Tca W c \u2264 0 [40]. Notice the weakest of\nthese energy conditions is the NEC condition. If the DEC is satisfied, it directly follows that\nthe WEC is satisfied. If the WEC is satisfied, then so is the NEC by a continuity argument.\nThe universal covering space or universal covering manifold of M can be constructed in\nthe following way: Pick a point x0 \u2208 M and consider the set of smooth paths P = {c :\n[0, 1] \u2192 M|c(0) = x0 }. A projection map \u03c0 : P \u2192 M is defined by \u03c0(c(t)) = c(1). Let M\nbe P modulo the equivalence relation, c1 \u223c c2 if and only if c1 (1) = c2 (1) and c1 is homotopic\nto c2 with endpoints fixed. The projection map \u03c0 is then well defined and smooth as a map\n\u03c0 : M \u2192 M. By construction, the universal covering manifold M is simply connected.\nNext, a n + 1-dimensional spacetime (M, gab ) is asymptotically flat (AF) if it can be\n\u2032\nconformally included into a spacetime-with-boundary M \u2032 = M \u222a I, with metric gab\n, such\n\u2032\nthat (a) for some conformal factor \u03a9 \u2208 C 1 (M \u2032 ), gab\n= \u03a92 gab on M and \u03a9 vanishes on I but\n\nhas null gradient which is nonvanishing pointwise on I. (b) The boundary \u2202M \u2032 = M \u2032 \\M = I\nis a disjoint union of past and future parts I + \u222a I \u2212 , each having topology S n\u22121 \u00d7 R with\ncomplete null generators.\nA n + 1-dimensional spacetime (M, gab ) is asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter (ALADS)\nif it can be conformally included into a spacetime-with-boundary M \u2032 = M \u222a I, with metric\n\u2032\ngab\n, such that \u2202M \u2032 = I is timelike (i.e., is a Lorentzian hypersurface in the induced metric)\n\u2032\nand M = M \u2032 \\ I. The conformal factor \u03a9 \u2208 C 1 (M \u2032 ) satisfies (a) \u03a9 > 0 and gab\n= \u03a92 gab on\n\nM, and (b) \u03a9 = 0 and d\u03a9 6= 0 pointwise on I. We permit I to have multiple components.\nA spacetime M, possibly with boundary, is globally hyperbolic if it is strongly causal and\nthe sets J + (p, M) \u2229 J \u2212 (q, M) are compact for all p, q \u2208 M.\n\n2\n\nThis definition is a generalization of that of a globally hyperbolic spacetime without\n2\n\nThe timelike future (causal future) of a set S relative to U , I + (S, U ) (J + (S, U )), is the set of all points\nthat can be reached from S by a future directed timelike curve (causal curve) in U . The interchange of\nthe past with future in the previous definition yields I \u2212 (S, U ) (J \u2212 (S, U )).\n\n5\n\n\fboundary and is satisfied by ALADS spacetimes.3 Also, note that the Penrose compactification of an AF spacetime (which is itself globally hyperbolic by the usual definition) is\nglobally hyperbolic in this general sense.\nA Cauchy surface V is a spacelike hypersurface such that every non-spacelike curve intersects this surface exactly once. Note V for a manifold with boundary I will have boundary\non I. A partial Cauchy surface is a surface that satisfies the weaker condition that each\nnon-spacelike curve intersects the surface at most once.\nThe domain of outer communications (DOC) is the portion of a spacetime M which is\nexterior to event horizons. Precisely D = I \u2212 (I0+ ) \u2229 I + (I0\u2212 ) for a connected component I0\nfor an AF spacetime and D = I \u2212 (I0 ) \u2229 I + (I0 ) for an ALADS spacetime. Intuitively, the\nDOC is the subset of M that is in causal contact with I. Note that D is the interior of an\n(n + 1)-dimensional spacetime-with-boundary D \u2032 = D \u222a I and that D \u2032 is itself a globally\nhyperbolic spacetime with boundary.\nAn event horizon is the boundary of the DOC. More specifically, a future event horizon\nis the boundary of the causal past of a connected component of the boundary at infinity, I0 ,\nJ \u0307\u2212 (I0 , M \u2032 ), a past event horizon is the boundary of the causal future of I0 , J \u0307+ (I0 , M \u2032 ) and\nthe event horizon is the union of future and past event horizons.\nA closed orientable spacelike surface in the Cauchy surface V is an outer trapped surface\nif the expansion of outgoing null geodesics orthogonal to it is nonpositive, \u03b8 \u2264 0. The case\n\u03b8 = 0 is a marginally outer trapped surface, also termed an apparent horizon. Note that in\n2+1 dimensions, an outer trapped surface is in fact a curve with the topology of a circle;\nhowever, we will adopt the convention of referring to it as a surface in keeping with the\nnomenclature of higher dimensions.\n\nIII.\n\nEXISTENCE AND NONEXISTENCE OF OUTER TRAPPED SURFACES IN\n\n2+1 GRAVITY\n\nWe begin with a set of theorems on the existence of outer trapped surfaces in AF and\nALADS spacetimes in 2 + 1 gravity. These theorems do not depend on the topology of\nthe Cauchy surface; however they play an essential role in the analysis of geons in the next\n3\n\nIn fact, it is that used in the proof of topological censorship in ALADS spacetimes [35].\n\n6\n\n\fsection. The first theorem demonstrates that a necessary condition for an outer trapped\nsurface is nonpositive cosmological constant. This result was first obtained by Ida [33]. Our\nproof, using the triad notation of [37], parallels that of [33]; both are based on the approach\nused in proving the topology of a marginally outer trapped surface by Hawking [38] and\nthat of the horizon in stationary spacetimes [39, 40]. (See [41] for a more readily available\noutline of the Hawking proof.) We then sharpen this result and fix a gap in its application\nto the zero cosmological constant case, pointed out in the 4-dimensional case by Galloway\n[42] by proving that there are no outer trapped surfaces in AF spacetimes that are analytic.\nFinally we prove that all 2 + 1-dimensional spacetimes with Einstein metric are analytic.\nTheorem 1. Let M 2+1 be a globally hyperbolic spacetime that satisfies the Einstein equations\nwith cosmological constant, Rab \u2212 12 Rgab + \u039bgab = 8\u03c0Tab , where Tab obeys the DEC. If M 2+1\ncontains an outer trapped surface, and the Cauchy surface containing it is not itself entirely\ntrapped, then \u039b \u2264 0.\nProof. Let V be a Cauchy surface in M 2+1 that contains an outer trapped surface. This\nsurface either is itself a marginally outer trapped surface or lies in a trapped region. If the\ntrapped region is not all of V , it must have an outer boundary and it follows that this outer\nboundary is the outermost marginally outer trapped surface in V .

Therefore Rab la lb , Tab na lb and consequently\nc are nonnegative. Thus the right hand side of (8) is negative if \u039b > 0. This implies that\nthere exists a trapped surface outside of S, in contradiction to the assumption that it was\nthe outermost marginally outer trapped surface. Hence \u039b \u2264 0.\nTheorem 1 does not directly use the asymptotic properties of the spacetime, although it\ndoes assume that the notion of an outer trapped surface is well defined, which implies that\nthere is some asymptotic region with respect to which the outer direction can be defined.\nIn addition, asymptotics can be used to show that the trapped region does not consist of all\nof V . In particular, AF and ALADS spacetimes have the property that large spatial circles\nnear the boundary at infinity are untrapped. Hence, the asymptotics of these spacetimes\nguarantee that the trapped region is not all of V and hence that there is a marginally outer\ntrapped surface.\nTheorem 1 directly tells us that there can be no outer trapped surface in a spacetime\nwith \u039b > 0.5 If \u039b < 0, it implies that a spacetime can indeed have trapped surfaces: the\nBTZ black hole [43] is an explicit example of such a spacetime.\nThe case \u039b = 0 is more complicated. If the matter source is such that c < 0 on S, indicating that matter is crossing the apparent horizon, then again one immediately concludes\nthat there can be no trapped surfaces in the spacetime. For example, spacetimes containing electromagnetic fields will have c < 0; hence there can be no outer trapped surfaces\nin 2 + 1-dimensional solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. This conclusion clearly\ngeneralizes to other long range fields satisfying the DEC. However, Theorem 1 leaves open\n5\n\nThis conclusion is, of course, subject to having an asymptotic region in a \u039b > 0 spacetime with respect\nto which a suitable definition of the outer direction can be defined.\n\n9\n\n\fthe possibility that a trapped surface can exist in a spacetime with \u039b = 0. Such a spacetime\nwould necessarily have vanishing stress energy projection Tab la (nb + lb ). In particular, the\nkey case of vacuum spacetime is included in these possibility.\nWe begin by ruling out the possibility of an outer trapped surface in analytic spacetimes\nwith \u039b = 0.\nCorollary 2. If M 2+1 , satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1, is an analytic spacetime with\nzero cosmological constant, then there are no outer trapped surfaces.\nProof. If c > 0 and/or \u03c4 \u2212 \u03baN P 6= 0 on S, the conclusion follows immediately from Theorem\n1. Therefore, assume these terms vanish at all points on S. By analyticity, \u03b8 is given by its\nTaylor expansion,\n\u03b8(s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ncn s n\n\nn=0\n\nand c0 and c1 vanish everywhere on S. Next, observe that\nc2 = lim+\ns\u21920\n\n\u03b8\nd\u03b8/ds\n= lim+\n2\ns\u21920\ns\n2s\n\n(9)\n\nBy (6) and appropriate choice of y (9) is equivalent to\nc2 = lim+ ey\ns\u21920\n\ney\n\u03b8\n(\u2212\u03b8 + \u01eb \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3) \u2212 ((\u03c4 \u2212 \u03baN P )2 + c) .\n2s\n2s\n\n(10)\n\nThe spin coefficients, c and y are analytic functions of s by the assumption of analyticity.\nTaking the limit, as the leading term in \u03b8 is c2 s2 , the first term on the right hand side\nvanishes, and the second term is manifestly nonpositive. It follows that c2 \u2264 0 everywhere\non S. If c2 < 0 for any point, there is an outer trapped surface in some neighborhood outside\nof S, in contradiction to initial assumption. If c2 = 0 at all points on S, then iteration of\nthe above argument yields the result that if the coefficients cn vanish on S for all n \u2264 k \u2212 1,\nck = lim+\ns\u21920\n\n\u03b8\ney\nd\u03b8/ds\ny\ne\n=\nlim\n(\u2212\u03b8\n+\n\u01eb\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u03b3)\n\u2212\n((\u03c4 \u2212 \u03baN P )2 + c) \u2264 0 .\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\n+\ns\u21920\nks\nks\nks\n\n(11)\n\nIf ck < 0 at some point on S, it again follows that there is an outer trapped surface in some\nneighborhood of it, in contradiction to initial assumption. If all coefficients vanish identically,\nthen it follows that \u03b8 must be zero somewhere for s > 0; that is, there exists a marginally\nouter trapped surface outside of S, again in contradiction to initial assumption.\n\n10\n\n\fWe will next consider the conditions under which the spacetime metric is analytic. First,\na well known result is that static vacuum spacetimes are analytic [44]. This result was\nextended to the stationary case in [45] and explicitly worked out for the case of EinsteinMaxwell gravity in [46]. These results were proven in 4 dimensions, but can be generalized\nto any dimension. As the future horizon and apparent horizon coincide for stationary spacetimes, one might conclude that stationary spacetimes satisfy the conditions of Corollary\n2. However, note that the methods used in the proof of the results [44, 45, 46] explicitly\nexclude the horizon. Thus, strictly speaking, these results only prove analyticity outside of\nit. Hence, although all known stationary solutions are in fact analytic on the horizon as\nwell, there is a potential issue in assuming analyticity at the horizon as needed for Corollary\n2.\nHowever, in 3 dimensions, one can prove a stronger result that covers this gap for the\nvacuum case; 2 + 1-dimensional vacuum spacetimes are analytic everywhere. This result\ndoes not assume staticity or stationarity.\nTheorem 3. Any 2 + 1-dimensional spacetime M 2+1 with Einstein metric is analytic.\nProof. An Einstein metric in 2 + 1 gravity satisfies\nRab = 2\u039bgab .\nwhere \u039b is the cosmological constant. The 3-dimensional Riemann tensor (4) is then\nRabcd = \u039b(gbd gac \u2212 gbc gad ) .\nNote that the Riemann curvature tensor is parallel because \u2207a Rbcde = 0. Next, recall that\nthe sectional curvature is defined by\nK(X, Y ) =\n\nRabcd X a Y b X c Y d\n.\n(gac gbd \u2212 gad gbc )X a Y b X c Y d\n\nThe sectional curvature for an Einstein metric in 3 dimensions is thus simply\nK(X, Y ) = \u039b .\nTherefore, a 2 + 1-dimensional spacetime with Einstein metric is a spacetime of constant\nsectional curvature, that is a local space form. In general, one can pick local coordinates at\neach point such that the metric can be written as\n2\n\nds =\n\n\u2212dT 2 + du2 + dv 2\n1 + 41 \u039b(u2 + v 2 \u2212 T 2 )\n11\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\n\fThis metric is thus analytic in a neighborhood of the point as the conformal factor is an\nanalytic function.\nThis result is entirely a consequence of the dimensionality. In general, Einstein metrics\nin 4 or more spacetime dimensions have non-zero Weyl curvature. Physically, this is due\nto the existence of gravitational waves. Therefore the analogue of Theorem 3 will not hold\nin general for Einstein metrics in four or more spacetime dimensions. However, the same\nproof and conclusions are true for a particular Einstein metric in any dimension if the Weyl\ncurvature of that metric vanishes.\nTheorem 3 shows that any 2 + 1-dimensional spacetime with Einstein metric is not only\nanalytic but is also a local space form. Furthermore, Theorem 3 is true regardless of whether\nor not the spacetime is spatially compact or open. Moreover, it applies even if the metric is\nnot globally hyperbolic, for example if the spacetime has closed timelike curves. Finally, the\nspacetime in Theorem 3 is not assumed to be complete. If the spacetime is complete, then it\nmust be obtained via a discrete group action on a maximal symmetric space (See, for example, [47]). However, if the spacetime is not complete, the global structure of the spacetime\nis much more complicated than that given by the simple local metric (12). This was first\npointed out by Morrow-Jones and Witt for the case of positive cosmological constant in 4\ndimensions [48, 49]. Later interest by mathematicians in 2+1-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes [50] was spurred by connections between spacetime structures, conformal structures\nand the work of Thurston.\nTheorem 3 shows that the conditions of Corollary 2 to Theorem 1 always hold for a\nvacuum AF spacetime. Therefore, there are no outer trapped surfaces in 2 + 1-dimensional\nvacuum AF spacetimes.\n\nIV.\n\nGEON SPACETIMES AND HORIZONS 2+1 GRAVITY\n\nWe have established that there are no outer trapped surfaces in 2+1-dimensional vacuum\nAF spacetimes. However, this fact does not itself show that there are no horizons. A\nstandard result in causal structure is that if a globally hyperbolic AF spacetime contains an\nouter trapped surface, this surface must lie inside a future event horizon [40]. However, the\nconverse is not true. A simple illustration of this, a slicing of Schwarzschild spacetime in\nwhich there are no outer trapped surfaces in the black hole region of the Cauchy surfaces was\n12\n\n\fexhibited by Wald and Iyer [51]. However, one can prove, using topological censorship, that\n2+1 AF or ALADS geon spacetimes must have horizons. Furthermore, these spacetimes also\nmust contain an outer trapped surface. These theorems, proven below, allow us to conclude\nour main result, the nonexistence of AF vacuum geon spacetimes.\nWe begin with the definition of a geon spacetime:\nDefinition 1. A globally hyperbolic spacetime M is a 2 + 1-dimensional geon if its Cauchy\nsurface V has interior homeomorphic to \u03a0 \u2212 {p} where \u03a0 is a closed 2-manifold other than\nthe 2-sphere S 2 , and {p} is a point.\nNote that a closed manifold is alternately termed a compact manifold without boundary.\nAn AF geon is a geon that also satisfies the definition of an AF spacetime. An ALADS geon\nsimilarly also satisfies the definition of an ALADS spacetime.\nTo prove our next result, we will utilize a key corollary of the topological censorship\nTheorem for 2 + 1-dimensional spacetimes [36]. In Theorems 4 and 5 below, the energy\ncondition used is the NEC. However, the topological censorship theorems hold under a form\nof the weaker, averaged null energy condition (ANEC).6 Clearly, Theorems 4 and 5 hold\nunder the more general energy condition, ANEC. However, the DEC implies the NEC;\ntherefore it suffices for the goals of this paper to state these theorems using the NEC.\nTheorem 4. Let D be the DOC of a globally hyperbolic, 2 + 1-dimensional AF or ALADS\nspacetime satisfying the NEC, and let V \u2032 = V \u222a \u2202V be a Cauchy surface in the Penrose\ncompactification of D. Then V is either B 2 (a disk) or I \u00d7 S 1 (an annulus).\nProof. (We provide here an extended, alternate proof to that in [36].) Let V \u2032 be the 2dimensional Cauchy surface in the Penrose compactified spacetime D \u2032 = D\u222aI with boundary\nat spatial infinity \u2202V = \u03c3\u221e . As D \u2032 satisfies the conditions needed to prove topological\ncensorship, it follows that the homomorphism of fundamental groups i\u2217 : \u03c01 (\u03c3\u221e ) \u2192 \u03c01 (V \u2032 )\ninduced by inclusion is surjective and D \u2032 is orientable if I is orientable [35, 36]. That is, the\nsequence \u03c01 (\u03c3\u221e ) \u2192 \u03c01 (V \u2032 ) \u2192 1 is exact.\nIn 3 dimensions, each connected component of I has topology S 1 \u00d7 R for AF geons and\nS 1 \u00d7R or R2 for ALADS geons. Therefore, the only choices for the spatial boundary topology\n6\n\nSpecifically, the form of ANEC used is that for each point p in M near I and any future complete null\nR\u221e\ngeodesic s \u2192 \u03b7(s) in M starting at p with tangent l, 0 Rab la lb ds \u2265 0.\n\n13\n\n\fat infinity are S 1 , the only closed connected 1-dimensional manifold, and R. First consider\nthe case where the spatial boundary at infinity is S 1 . Then \u03c01 (S 1 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (V \u2032 ) \u2192 1 and V \u2032\nis orientable. Since \u03c01 (S 1 ) = Z, it follows that Z \u2192 \u03c01 (V \u2032 ) \u2192 1. This exact sequence and\nbasic group theory imply that \u03a01 (V \u2032 ) = Z/ker i\u2217 . Since the kernel of i\u2217 must be a subgroup\nof the integers, ker i\u2217 \u2282 Z, it follows that ker i\u2217 = sZ where s is a fixed non-negative integer.\nTherefore, \u03c01 (V \u2032 ) = Z/sZ = Zs . Now, from the classification of 2-manifolds, V \u2032 must be a\nclosed orientable 2-manifold minus a disjoint union of one or more disks. It follows from the\nclassification of 2-manifolds and their fundamental groups that s = 0 or s = 1 and that the\nonly choices for V are B 2 (a disk) or I \u00d7 S 1 (an annulus). Finally, consider the case where\nthe spatial boundary at infinity topology is R. It immediately follows from the fact that R\nis contractible and \u03c01 (R) \u2192 \u03c01 (V \u2032 ) \u2192 1 that V \u2032 is also contractible, \u03c01 (V \u2032 ) = 1. Hence, for\nthis case, the only choice for V is B 2 .\nIt is important to note that this theorem determines the spatial topology of the DOC,\nthe region of spacetime which can be probed from infinity, not that of the full spacetime.\nThus it allows the Cauchy slice of the full spacetime M 2+1 to have non-trivial topology; this\ntopology, however, will be behind a single horizon. This result is shown below.\nTheorem 5. Let M 2+1 be a globally hyperbolic AF or ALADS geon spacetime satisfying\nNEC, and let V be a Cauchy surface in M 2+1 . Then the spacetime has a horizon.\nProof. By the definition of a geon, the interior of the Cauchy surface is \u03a0 \u2212 {p}. Assume\nthat the geon spacetime has no horizon; it follows that the DOC of M 2+1 is itself M 2+1 .\nHowever, according to Theorem 4, the interior of the Cauchy surface of M 2+1 is then either\nB 2 or I \u00d7 S 1 . These spaces are topologically S 2 \u2212 {p} or R2 \u2212 {p}. Hence neither contain\nany nontrivial topology and are not the Cauchy surface of a geon, in contradiction to the\ninitial assumption. Therefore the geon spacetime has a horizon.\nTheorems 4 and 5 imply that if a spacetime has any non-trivial topology, it is hidden\ninside a horizon. Moreover, there is never more than one black hole horizon bounding the\nDOC of each connected component of I in any 2 + 1-dimensional AF or ALADS spacetime.\nHence an observer in the asymptotic region characterizes the spacetime as containing a single\nblack hole.7 This still leaves open the question of whether or not there exist geon solutions\n7\n\nIn 2+1 gravity, Brill [30] uses the terminology multi-black hole spacetime to describe the structure\n\n14\n\n\fof the Einstein equations that exhibit horizons. The answer is clearly yes for the ALADS\ncase; the spinning anti-de Sitter wormhole [32] is such a geon. Another easily exhibited geon\nis the RP 2 geon, the 3-dimensional analog of the RP 3 geon of [34]. It can be built from\nthe standard 2 + 1-dimensional AdS black hole solution [43] with spatial topology S 1 \u00d7 R\nby identification of the two asymptotic regions to form a single one. It contains a t = 0\nhypersurface formed from that of the AdS black hole by identification of antipodal points on\nits totally geodesic S 1 throat. This hypersurface consequently has the topology of RP 2 \u2212{p}.\nOther ALADS solutions, including those whose Cauchy surfaces have nontrivial topology\nand have more than one asymptotic region, are also examples with horizons [30, 31].\nTherefore the key question is whether or not there exist geon solutions for the case of zero\ncosmological constant. To answer this equation we first establish that all AF geons contain\nan outer trapped surface.\nTheorem 6. Every globally hyperbolic, AF geon that satisfies the NEC has a cover whose\nCauchy surface contains an outer trapped surface.\nProof. Assume that there exists M 2+1 , an globally hyperbolic AF geon. First, the DEC\nimplies the NEC; therefore Theorem 5 implies M 2+1 must have all topology behind a horizon.\nWe now show a contradiction to the existence of a horizon for the AF case. We do so by\nshowing that the existence of a horizon implies that there is an outer trapped surface in\na AF spacetime that is a cover of the geon. Let the Cauchy surface of M 2+1 be V . As\nM 2+1 is globally hyperbolic , \u03c01 (M 2+1 ) = \u03c01 (V ). As M 2+1 is a geon, \u03c01 (V ) 6= 1. By\ndefinition, V = \u03a0 \u2212 {p} where \u03a0 is a closed 2-manifold other than S 2 . Therefore \u03a0 must be\nmultiply-connected, and as such has a universal covering space \u03a0\u0302.\n\u02c6 be the inverse image of the point {p} in \u03a0\u0302. Removing the points {p}\n\u02c6 from \u03a0\u0302\nLet {p}\ngives us a space V\u0302 . V\u0302 is a covering space of V and has multiple disconnected asymptotic\nregions. Let M\u0302 2+1 be the corresponding covering space of M 2+1 induced by the multiple\ncovering of the Cauchy slice V . The geometries of V\u0302 and M\u0302 2+1 are locally the same as V\nand M 2+1 , respectively. Therefore M\u0302 2+1 will have multiple disconnected asymptotic regions\neach of which are AF.\ncertain 2+1 ALADS spacetimes. This terminology does not mean multiple black hole horizons in a\nsingle asymptotic region. Multi-black hole spacetimes, as clearly noted by Brill, in fact have multiple\ndisconnected components of I with a single black hole horizon bounding the DOC of each disconnected\ncomponent. Thus they clearly satisfy our theorems.\n\n15\n\n\fLet I0 be a connected component of the boundary at infinity of M\u0302 2+1 corresponding\nto the I of M 2+1 . By Theorem 5, the other multiple disconnected asymptotic regions are\nseparated from I0 by horizons. Let Ii be the boundary at infinity of one such disconnected\nregion. As the spacetime is AF, one can find large spacelike circles in the neighborhood of\nIi that have expansion \u03b8 with the sign of that in Minkowski spacetime; positive outward\nand negative inward where outward is defined as the radial spatial direction toward Ii . This\nsurface is outer trapped with respect to I0 as any curve from this surface to I0 must travel\nradially inward, that is away from Ii . As the expansion in this direction is negative, this\nlarge circle is outer trapped with respect to I0 . As the Cauchy surface can be chosen such\nthat it contains this large circle, there is an outer trapped surface in V\u0302 .8\nAlso note that Cauchy surfaces containing outer trapped surfaces must also exist for\nALADS spacetimes in 3 dimensions by a similar argument.\nIt is important to note that this proof does not use the universal cover of V . In 3dimensional AF spacetimes, each connected component of I is not itself simply connected, in\ncontrast to the case in 4 or more spacetime dimensions. This fact means that the construction\nof the universal cover of V unwinds not only nontrivial curves that characterize the geon\nitself but also those that wrap I. This results in an unnecessarily complicated covering space\nwith very different structure than that needed to prove Theorem 6 and its corollaries.\nGiven that the existence of a horizon in a AF geon spacetime implies the existence of an\nouter trapped surface, we can prove our final results.\nCorollary 7. There are no globally hyperbolic, AF geons M 2+1 that satisfy the vacuum\nEinstein equations.\nProof. If such an M 2+1 exists, Theorems 5 and 6 imply that it has a horizon and its cover\nhas an outer trapped surface. Theorem 1 and its Corollary 2 apply as vacuum AF spacetimes\nin 3 dimensions are analytic by Theorem 3. Thus no Cauchy surface of the covering space\n8\n\nObserve that the construction in [51] shows a special slicing of extended Schwarzschild that does not\nexhibit outer trapped surfaces in the black hole region of r \u2264 2M . These Cauchy surfaces clearly contain\nouter trapped surfaces with respect to I0 ; they have r > 2M and lie in the second asymptotic region.\nTheir existence is irrelevant for the purpose of the Wald and Iyer example as black holes formed from\ncollapse do not have a second asymptotic region. Furthermore, other slicings of Schwarzschild have outer\ntrapped surfaces in the black hole region.\n\n16\n\n\fM\u0302 2+1 of the AF geon can contain an outer trapped surface. Hence, there is a contradiction\nto Theorem 6. Thus such a geon cannot exist.\nThis corollary can readily be generalized to other cases of interest;\nCorollary 8. There are no globally hyperbolic, AF geons that satisfy the vacuum EinsteinMaxwell equations.\nIts proof follows directly by a similar proof to Corollary 7; in this case the presence of the\nMaxwell stress energy tensor implies that c 6= 0 so the result follows directly from Theorem\n1. At this point it is clear that the proof of the non-existence of AF geons can be extended\nto any case for which there can be no outer trapped surface. Such cases include all geons\nwith long range matter fields.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have demonstrated that the existence of 2 + 1-dimensional geons requires a negative\ncosmological constant. Moreover, Theorem 5 implies the topology any spacetime is always\nhidden behind a single horizon. Specifically, if one has two or more geons in anti-de Sitter\nspacetime consisting of a Cauchy surface containing two or more spatially separated local\ntopological structures such as two or more handles on R2 , an observer in the asymptotic\nregion only sees a single horizon that hides all structures from their view. This is in marked\ncontrast to the 4-dimensional case.\nAlthough our proof of Theorem 1 is essentially the same as that of [33], we have paid more\nattention to the case of zero cosmological constant. In particular, we have used analyticity\nto rule out the case of vacuum geons. This step is essential to our work. The fact that the\nargument for the analyticity of the vacuum Einstein equations in 3 dimensions can be made\nwithout assumption of stationarity or staticity is again in contrast to the 4-dimensional case.\nOur careful treatment of the vacuum case is also essential to any rigorous proof that there\nis no Schwarzschild solution in 2 + 1 gravity. Theorem 6 and the observation that existence\nof a Schwarzschild solution implies existence of an RP 2 geon also implies that there is no\nSchwarzschild solution due to this careful analysis of the vacuum case. We are not aware\nof this appearing previously in the literature. Although we have concentrated attention on\nthe vacuum and Einstein-Maxwell cases, similar corollaries clearly can be proven for any\n17\n\n\fother matter fields coupled to gravity that satisfy the DEC. Furthermore, it is reasonable\nto anticipate that the rigidity of 2 + 1 gravity allows one to rule out the existence of outer\ntrapped surfaces in nonanalytic solutions as well.\nFinally, note that these results apply not just to Einstein gravity but to any 2+1 spacetime that satisfies the conditions of the theorems. In particular, note that the null energy\ncondition is in fact a condition on the Ricci curvature and can be easily checked for any\nspacetime. Similarly, the dominant energy condition is used in Theorem 1 to obtain a definite sign on the curvature contraction in (5). Therefore, these conditions can be checked for\nsolutions of any 2+1 gravitational theory, including higher derivative theories.\nInterestingly, certain common 2+1 gravitational theories violate the needed condions.\nFor example, solutions of the gravitating nonlinear O(3) \u03c3 model [52] satisfies the NEC for\npositive gravitational constant and violates the NEC for negative gravitational constant.\nNot surprisingly, these solutions also violate the conditions needed on the curvature for\nTheorem 1 for the negative gravitational constant case. It is easy to see why in this model;\nchanging the sign of the gravitational constant changes the sign of the stress energy tensor.\nConsequently, the DEC is violated. The violation of the NEC and DEC are why the O(3)\nmodel exhibits multiple black hole solutions.\nSecondly, certain nontrivial solutions of topologically massive gravity violate NEC. The\nMCL black hole [53], a nontrivial vacuum solution to topologically massive gravity, violates\nthe NEC. It also violates the curvature conditions needed for Theorem 1, as one would\nexpect. Similarly, warped AdS black holes in 2+1 dimensions [54, 55, 56] also generically\nviolate the NEC. The spatially warped AdS black hole violates NEC unless \u03bcl = 3, in which\ncase it is simply AdS3 . The timelike warped AdS black hole violates the NEC in the squashed\ncase, \u03bcl < 3.\n\n9\n\nTherefore, these examples violate the conditions needed for the topological\n\ncensorship theorem proven in Section IV. Interestingly, this violation is independent of the\nsign of the gravitational constant. Therefore multiple black hole solutions could, in principle,\nexist in these theories. Thus geon solutions in which the geons are behind separate black\nhole horizons could also exist in these theories. Finally, as the NEC is used in the proof of\nthe singularity theorems, there is no reason that geon solutions need be shrouded by black\nhole horizons.\n9\n\nThe stretched case contains closed timelike curves and hence is not globally hyperbolic.\n\n18\n\n\fNote that satisfaction of the NEC is a crucial ingredient for fundamental results in general relativity. The NEC or a convergence condition stronger than the NEC is imposed in\nall version of the singularity theorems [40]. It is also imposed in the area theorem of Hawking. Consequently, in solutions that violate the NEC, one may not have the connection\nbetween increasing horizon area and increase of entropy as dictated by the second law of\nthermodynamics.\nIn summary, there are no geon containing solutions of asymptotically flat vacuum gravity\nin 2+1 dimensions. Solutions to asymptotically AdS 2+1 gravity can contain geons; however\nall geons are hidden behind a single black hole horizon. In contrast, solutions in theories\nsuch as the O(3) \u03c3 model with negative gravitational constant and topologically massive\ngravity potentially can contain geons, either each behind a separate black hole horizon or\npossibly behind no horizons as solutions in these theories violate the NEC. However, as the\nNEC is violated, one expects these solutions to be generically unstable. This instability\nmay be related to those noted in topologically massive gravity at the chiral point from a\nperturbative viewpoint [57].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work was supported by NSERC.
