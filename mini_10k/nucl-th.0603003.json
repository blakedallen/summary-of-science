INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\n\nAccording to our present knowledge, the properties of hadrons and their interactions can be described in terms of\nQuantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD). In the limit of vanishing quark masses QCD incorporates chiral symmetry, which\nis spontaneously broken in vacuum. The order parameter hq\u0304qi of this symmetry breaking is expected to decrease by\nabout 30% already at normal nuclear matter density (1; 2; 3). Therefore, signals for partial chiral symmetry restoration\nshould be observable in nuclear reaction experiments and, in particular, photon induced processes are highly suited\ndue to two key reasons. The reaction leaves the nucleus close to its ground state, so the reaction takes place under\nwell defined conditions. And as a second point, the photon penetrates deeply into the nucleus, giving rise to a high\neffective density.\nThe modification of the so-called \u03c3 or f0 (600) meson inside the nuclear medium was proposed as a signal for such a\npartial symmetry restoration. Theoretical models predict a shift of its spectral strength to lower masses and a more\nnarrow width due to the onset of the restoration (4; 5). The \u03c3-meson is a very short-lived state with a width of\nroughly 600 \u2212 1000 MeV (6), decaying predominantly into a \u03c0\u03c0 final state in S-wave. Therefore, the experimental\naim has been to find modifications of this state in \u03c0\u03c0 production reactions in finite nuclear systems close to threshold.\nSuch experiments have been performed with incident pions by the CHAOS collaboration (7; 8) and with photons\nby the TAPS collaboration (9; 10; 11; 12). Both experiments have shown an accumulation of strength near the \u03c0\u03c0\nthreshold in the decay channel of the \u03c3 in large nuclei. A possible interpretation of this effect is the in-medium\nmodification of this resonance due to partial symmetry restoration. Already in an earlier work (13), we have, however,\npointed out the importance of conventional final-state effects in the analysis of the experiment performed by the TAPS\ncollaboration.\nTo analyse the experiment performed by the TAPS collaboration (9; 10; 11; 12), we need to consider pions with\nvery low energy in nuclear matter. Aiming to employ a BUU transport model, we first need to establish that it is\nmeaningful to discuss pions with a long wave length in such a semi-classical picture. Actually, this question can only\nbe answered by comparison to quantum calculations and experimental data. Therefore, in this paper we investigate\nthe validity of our model for the treatment of the \u03c0\u03c0 final state with the description of pion-induced scattering and\nabsorption experiments within the BUU-framework.\nAlready in earlier works of Salcedo et al. (14), with a simulation of pion propagation in nuclear matter, and of Engel\net al. (15), with a precursor of our present simulation, pions with kinetic energies in the regime of 85 \u2212 300 MeV have\nbeen investigated in transport models. As motivated above, we now investigate even less energetic pions. Therefore,\n\n\u2217\u2217 Work supported by DFG\n\u2217 Electronic address: oliver.buss@theo.physik.uni-giessen.de;\n\nDFG.\n\nURL: http://theorie.physik.uni-giessen.de/~oliver; Work supported by\n\n\f2\nwe have carefully accounted for Coulomb corrections in the initial channel of \u03c0-induced processes and improved the\ndescription of the threshold behavior of the cross sections in the model.\nThis article is structured in the following way. First we introduce our Giessen BUU (GiBUU) transport model\nfor the treatment of photon- and pion-induced nuclear reactions emphasizing the most relevant issues. Next, we\npresent results on the pion mean-free-path in nuclear matter and discuss the consequences of medium modifications\nof the pion. Hereafter we compare our simulation to experimental results on pion scattering off complex nuclei to\nvalidate our model. Finally, we conclude with results concerning the \u03c0\u03c0 photoproduction at incident beam energies\nof 400 \u2212 500 MeV.\nII. THE GIBUU TRANSPORT MODEL\n\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport models are based on the Boltzmann equation, which was modified\nin the 1930's by Nordheim, Uehling and Uhlenbeck to incorporate quantum statistics. It is of semi-classical nature, but\ncan be derived as a gradient-expansion of the fully quantum Kadanoff-Baym-equations (16). Nowadays this model is\nwidely used in heavy-ion collisions, electro- and pion-induced reactions to describe these processes in a coupled-channel\napproach.\nThe Giessen BUU-model has been utilized in various applications including heavy-ion-collisions, photon-, electron-,\npion- and neutrino-induced processes. In contrast to earlier works (13; 17; 18) we are now using a new implementation,\nnamed GiBUU (19). It is in its algorithms based upon the old implementation, therefore also reproduces the former\nresults. For a detailed discussion concerning the physical input and the algorithms we refer the reader to (17; 18; 20)\nand the references therein. For the reader interested in technical details, we note that the new code is now written\nin modular manner in modern Fortran (21) utilizing Subversion (22) version control in a multi-user environment. It\nrepresents a major leap forward to a simplified handling of the transport code and a more transparent implementation\nof future projects.\nA. The BUU equation\n\nThe BUU equation actually consists of a series of coupled differential equations, which describe the time evolution\nof the one-particle phase-space-densities f1a (~\np, ~r, t) in the limit of low particle densities. The index a = \u03c0, \u03c9, N, \u2206, . . .\ndenotes the different particle species in our model.\nFor a particle of species X with negligible width, its time evolution is given by\n\u0001\ndf1X (~r, p~, t)\n\u2202f1X (~r, ~\np, t) \u2202HX \u2202f1X (~r, p~, t) \u2202HX \u2202f1X (~r, ~p, t)\n=\n+\n\u2212\n= Icoll f1X , f1a , f1b , . . .\ndt\n\u2202t\n\u2202~\np\n\u2202~r\n\u2202~r\n\u2202~p\n\n(1)\n\nwith the one-body Hamilton function\n\nHX (~r, p~) =\n\nr\u0010\n\n\u00112\n~ X (~r, ~p) + m2 + UX (~r, p~) + A0X (~r, p~) .\np~ + A\nX\n\nThe scalar potential UX and the vector potential A\u03bcX of species X may in principle depend upon the phase space\ndensities of all other species. Hence, the differential equations are already coupled through the mean fields. In the limit\nof Icoll = 0, equation (1) becomes the well-known Vlasov equation. The collision term Icoll ({f1a , a = \u03c0, \u03c9, N, \u2206, . . .})\non the right-hand side of equation (1) incorporates explicitly all scattering processes among the particles. The reaction\nprobabilities used in this collision term are chosen to match the elementary collisions among the particles in vacuum.\nWithin the BUU framework the total reaction cross sections are given by an incoherent sum over all partial cross\nsections. Interference effects are therefore neglected.\nB. Elementary processes\n\nThe elementary processes of interest in the present study are \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c0N and \u03c0N N \u2194 N N reactions. Both\nare modeled within a resonance picture. Therefore, we express the relevant cross sections as an incoherent sum of\nresonance and background contributions.\nBG\n\u03c3\u03c0N \u2192\u03c0N = \u03c3\u03c0N \u2192R\u2192\u03c0N + \u03c3\u03c0N\n\u2192\u03c0N\nBG\n\u03c3N N \u2192N N \u03c0 = \u03c3N N \u2192RN \u2192N N \u03c0 + \u03c3N\nN \u2192N N \u03c0\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\nThe resonance cross sections are obtained from the partial wave analysis of ref. (23). The background cross sections\ndenoted by \u03c3 BG are chosen in such a manner, that the elementary cross section data in the vacuum are reproduced (20).\nWithin our model, background contributions are instantaneous in space-time, whereas reactions through resonance\nchannels are delayed by the lifetime of the resonance.\nAll different events in pion nucleon scattering can be categorized into four different isospin channels\n\u03c3\u03c0\u2212 n\u2192\u03c0\u2212 n = \u03c3\u03c0+ p\u2192\u03c0+ p ,\n\u03c3\u03c0\u2212 p\u2192\u03c00 n = \u03c3\u03c00 n\u2192\u03c0\u2212 p = \u03c3\u03c0+ n\u2192\u03c00 p = \u03c3\u03c00 p\u2192\u03c0+ n ,\n\u03c3\u03c0\u2212 p\u2192\u03c0\u2212 p = \u03c3\u03c0+ n\u2192\u03c0+ n ,\n\u03c3\u03c00 n\u2192\u03c00 n = \u03c3\u03c00 p\u2192\u03c00 p .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nThe cross sections in the individual channels are either connected by time reversal or isospin symmetry. The first\nchannel (eq. 3) is a pure isospin I = 3/2 scattering process, whereas the other three channels are mixtures of I = 1/2\nand I = 3/2. The cross section for the I = 3/2 channel \u03c3\u03c0 N \u2192\u2206\u2192\u03c0 N is given explicitly in (24) based on the resonance\nanalysis by Manley and Saleski (23). As can be seen in the upper left panel of fig. 1, the first channel is well described\nsolely by the \u2206-resonance scattering; therefore, we neglect a background term in this channel. In the second and third\nchannels (eq. 4 and 5) there are good data sets for\n\u03c0\u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0\u2212 p\n\u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n.\ndown to very low energies. Hence, we introduce a background term on top of our resonance contributions for a better\ndescription of those channels as shown in the remaining panels of fig. 1. The last channel (eq. 6) is inaccessible for\nexperiment, therefore we can not introduce any background term.\nConcerning total cross sections, the relevant contributions to the scattering of pions and protons are shown in fig. 2\nfor the different pion charge states.

Medium modifications\n\nAs medium modifications we implement, besides effects like Pauli-blocking, Fermi-motion of the nucleons and\nCoulomb forces, also different types of hadronic potentials for the particles and density dependent modifications of\nthe decay widths. We emphasize that the imaginary parts of the potentials are in general not included since their\neffects are already accounted for by the collision term. Only in the case of the \u2206 resonance we follow a prescription\nwhich includes imaginary contributions of the optical potential as explained below.\nIn position-space the nucleons are initialized according to Wood-Saxon-Distributions.

The nucleon potential is described by a momentum-dependent mean-field potential (for explicit details and\nparameters see (18)).

Pion potential\n\nFor the first time we have also included a realistic potential in the Hamiltonian of the BUU equation for the \u03c0\nmeson at very low energies. Below 80 MeV pion momentum a model by Nieves et al. (38) was used. In general,\nthe pion spectral function shows at low energies three peak structures - the so called pion, nucleon-hole and \u2206-hole\nbranches. At momenta smaller than 150 MeV the pion is most probably found in the pion branch in which the\ndispersion relation does not differ much from the free one of the pion. Therefore we evaluate the optical potential at\nthe vacuum position of the dispersion relation.\nIn latest experiments at GSI (39) and MAMI (40) new results on the pionic self energy at threshold were obtained.\nThe results hint at a value of about A0\u03c0 (p = 0) \u2243 25 MeV. The potential by Nieves et al. (38) amounts to a somewhat\nlower value of about 18 MeV in symmetric nuclear matter at normal matter density. It is important to realize that\nsuch a repulsive potential limits the applicability of any semi-classical model to pion kinetic energies & 20 MeV in\nthe central density region.\nAbove 140 MeV a first-order \u2206-hole result was used. In this energy regime the potential acting on the pion is defined\nby averaging over the spectral strength in the pion and the \u2206-hole branches. To ensure a continuous derivative of the\nHamiltonian, both models were matched in the region of p = 80 \u2212 140 MeV. The potential for the pion is shown in\nfig. 7. It is repulsive in the low-momentum regime, for higher momenta it turns attractive. The repulsion is caused\nby a only weakly momentum dependent S-wave term, while the attraction is due to a momentum dependent P -wave\nterm, which vanishes at zero momentum and gains strength with increasing momentum. At constant density the\npotential is, therefore, continously decreasing with momentum in the range considered here.\n0,3\n\nmomentum (GeV)\n\n-21 MeV\n\n-18 MeV\n-15 MeV\n\n0,2\n-9 MeV\n-3 MeV\n\n-12 MeV\n\n-6 MeV\n\n0,1\n0 MeV\n3 MeV\n6 MeV\n\n9 MeV\n\n12 MeV\n\n0,0\n0,00\n\n0,04\n\n0,08\n\ndensity (fm\n\n0,12\n-3\n\n0,16\n\n)\n\nFIG. 7 Hadronic potential A0 of the pion as function of nucleon density and pion momentum in symmetric nuclear matter in\nunits of MeV.\n\n\f9\nIII. RESULTS OF THE SIMULATIONS\nA. The mean free path of pions in nuclear matter\n\nHere, we discuss simple properties of the pion in the medium and compare to other theoretical calculations. In\nparticular we investigate the total width\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd(ln (N\u03c0 ))\n\u0393tot = ln \u2212\ndt\nand mean free path \u03bb. These quantities are connected via the relation \u03bb = v/\u0393tot , where v denotes the velocity of\nthe pions. In our model the loss of pions per time-step \u2206t is given by\nX Z\n1 \u2206N\u03c0 (E, \u03c1n , \u03c1p )\n=\u2212\nd3 pN e\u2212\u03c3N (p\u03c0 ,pN )\u03c1N v(p\u03c0 ,\u03c1p ,\u03c1n )\u2206t\nN\u03c0\n\u2206t\nN =n,p\nZ\nZ\nX\nBG\n\u2212\nd3 pN d3 pM e\u2212\u0393 (p\u03c0 ,pN ,pM ,\u03c1N ,\u03c1M )\u2206t = \u2212e\u2212\u0393tot \u2206t\n(N,M)\u2208{(n,p),(n,n),(p,p)}\n\nwhere v denotes the pion velocity in the medium, \u03c3N - the \u03c0N scattering cross section and \u0393BG is the absorptive\nthree-body width of the pion and \u0393tot the total width. For the cross sections and the width we include the medium\nmodifications discussed earlier. The integrals above are performed over the Fermi spheres of neutrons and protons.\nIn practice, we obtain \u0393tot by performing a Monte-Carlo simulation with pions and nucleons initialized in a box with\ncontinuous boundary conditions within our BUU framework, including all the medium modifications and necessary\ncollision rates.\nThe momentum p\u03c0 is calculated in the medium from the dispersion relation\np\np2\u03c0 + m2\u03c0 + A\u03c00 (p) + VC\nEtotal =\nwith the hadronic potential A\u03c00 and the Coulomb potential VC . Finally, \u0393tot and \u03bb can be easily extracted by observing\nthe time evolution of the pions. All results are shown as functions of the experimental observable\nVacuum\nEkin\n= Etotal \u2212 m\u03c0\nVacuum\nin the classically allowed region Ekin\n\u2265 A\u03c00 (p) + VC .\n\n1. Isospin dependence\n\nTo begin with, we study the case in which we omit all potentials. In the GiBUU-simulation we use the same mass\nof m\u03c0 = 138 MeV for all pions regardless of the charge. For both the positive and the negative pions the same data\nare used as input for the vacuum cross sections. Due to isospin symmetry the positive and negative charge states have\nthe same properties in symmetric matter if electromagnetic forces are neglected. In fig. 8 we observe that the positive\nand neutral pions do actually have the same velocities, but not the same width in nuclear matter. The difference is\nquite small except for very low energies. The reason for this can be found in the elementary absorption and scattering\nprocesses. As mentioned before, we have used vacuum data to pin down the elementary reaction rates. Therefore the\nabsorptive width of the charged pions is fixed by the elementary reactions\np p \u2192 p n \u03c0+\np n \u2192 p p \u03c0\u2212\nwhile the absorptive width of the \u03c0 0 is determined by\np p \u2192 p p \u03c00\np n \u2192 p n \u03c00\nthrough detailed balance. Fig. 4 shows that the three-body absorption rate for the neutral pions at low energies is\nhigher than for the charged ones.

The upper panels show the velocity of the pions in\nnuclear matter, the lower ones visualize the full width of the pion. The lower curves in the lower panel denoted \"only 3-body\"\ndo not include two-body processes or resonance production.\n\n2. Collisional width in the medium\n\nUsing the neutral pion as an example, we first discuss the lower right panel of fig. 8. At low energies there\nis practically no difference in the width between the simulation with (dashed lines) and without (solid lines) pion\npotential. Due to the absence of resonance contributions in this energy regime, the width of the pion is dominated\nby its absorption via the N N \u03c0 \u2192 N N background. At higher energies a small difference in the two curves can be\nobserved. Here the decay width is somewhat smaller if the pion potential is included.\nThis difference can be understood by investigating the resonance production process N \u03c0 \u2192 \u2206 in detail (20). At\nfixed pion energy, the attractive pion potential leads to a higher momentum of the pion and, therefore, also to a\nhigher momentum of the produced \u2206, resulting in a decrease of its mass. In the considered energy regime this mass\nis smaller than the pole mass. As a consequence, the production of the \u2206 resonance is less probable and the width of\nthe pion decreases.\n3.

The curves presented with dashed dotted lines are charge-averaged results of P. Hecking (42), which we will\ndiscuss later. The panel on the right shows the mean free path of the charged mesons, including Coulomb effects. We explicitly\ninvestigate the result with and without hadronic potential and Coulomb potential for the pion, all other standard medium\nmodifications are included.\n\nstrongly modified at low values of Ekin . The second term \u2202A\u03c00 /\u2202p is always negative. It is large in absolute magnitude\nfor low energies and small for energies greater than 80 MeV and leads to an overall reduction of the velocities.\n4. Results for the mean free path.\n\nAfter having extracted the width of the pion in the nuclear matter restframe directly from our numerical simulation\nthe mean free path is obtained by \u03bb = v/\u0393. Therefore we now consider the two effects discussed earlier in order to\nunderstand the changes in the mean free path: modification of the decay width \u0393 and modification of the velocity v\ndue to the potentials. The effect of including the hadronic potential becomes visible in fig. 9, especially at very low\nenergies. The mean free path drops rapidly at low energies compared to the simulation without hadronic potential.\nThis sharp decrease of the mean free path as a function of asymptotic kinetic energy stems from the velocity decrease\nat low energies when including the repulsive hadronic potential. At larger values of the kinetic energy the effect of\nwidth and velocity just compensate each other.\nFor charged pions, electromagnetic forces play an important role, especially at low energies. Since in nuclear matter\ncalculations we cannot introduce any Coulomb potential based on the actual density, we assume a reasonable constant\nCoulomb potential of VC = \u00b120 MeV depending on the charge of the pion.

The hadronic potential for the\npion is not included.\n\nshown in fig. 10. The most important effect of the hadronic potential is the large decrease of the mean free path at\nvery low energies, qualitatively similar to that already discussed for the \u03c0 0 above.\nWe have also studied the density dependence of the mean free path, choosing the \u03c0 0 as a showcase. The results are\nshown in fig. 11. It is important to note that the density dependence is highly nonlinear, contrary to the low-density\nlimit. This non-linearity is generated by the N N \u03c0 \u2192 N N process, which goes to first order quadratically with density,\nand by the implicit density dependence in the medium modifications.\n5. The vacuum approximation.\n\nWe now compare our results to the eikonal vacuum approximation (35; 43),commonly found in the literature. In\nthis approximation the mean free path is given by\n\u03bb=\n\n1\n1\n.\n=\n2 I(p)\n\u03c1 \u03c3V ac\n\n(11)\n\nI(p) denotes the imaginary part of the momentum. Using the total cross sections shown in fig. 2, we can now\nevaluate the mean free path. We assume \u03c3\u03c0\u2212 n\u2192X = \u03c3\u03c0+ p\u2192X and \u03c3\u03c0+ n\u2192X = \u03c3\u03c0\u2212 p\u2192X because there exist no data\nfor \u03c0 scattering off neutrons.\nIn the case of symmetric matter, we calculate \u03c3V ac for the \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 by averaging over the neutron and proton\ncontribution to the cross section:\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n1\n\u00b1\n\u03c3 \u00b1\n+ \u03c3\u03c0\u00b1 p\u2192X =\n\u03c3 +\n+ \u03c3\u03c0\u2212 p\u2192X .\n\u03c3Vac\n=\n2 \u03c0 n\u2192X\n2 \u03c0 p\u2192X\nFor charged pions the mean free path in this approximation is shown in fig. 12. Comparing it to a full BUU calculation,\nwhich considers the Pauli blocking of the final states, as well as the Fermi motion of the initial states and three-body\ninteractions, we see a dramatic discrepancy at small energies.\nFor completeness we have also investigated the influence of Fermi-motion and calculated the mean free path by\nintegrating over the interactions in the Fermi sea:\n\u03bb=\n\n1\n\n4\n\nRRR\npF\n\n\u221a d3 p .\n\u03c3V ac ( s) (2\u03c0)\n3\n\n(12)\n\nThe result can also be seen in fig. 12. The modifications of the mean free path due to the Fermi motion in the vacuum\napproximation are very small.\nThe vacuum approximation does not consider any kind of many-body interactions at low energy. Only the two body\n\u03c0N interaction is allowed.

A BUU calculation without Coulomb forces and without hadronic potential for the pion is shown for\ncomparison.\n\nfor the N N \u2192 N N \u03c0 channel. In fig. 8 we see the large contribution of this process to the width at low energies. Such\na three body N N \u03c0 interaction is not included in the vacuum approximation. At higher energies, especially above\n120 MeV the vacuum approximation coincides with our results, since there the dominant process is the two body\nprocess N \u03c0 \u2192 \u2206.\nWe conclude that the naive vacuum approximation is qualitatively and quantitatively not reliable in the energy\nregime of Ekin . 70 MeV where multi-body collisions, potential effects and Pauli-blocking are important.\n6. Comparison to optical model results.\n\nIn (42) Hecking published calculations of the pion mean-free-path based on two different types of phenomenological\noptical potentials Vopt . The first parameter set for an optical potential is taken out of Stricker's analysis (44), the\nsecond one is calculated by Chai and Riska (45). Starting from equation (11) one\u0001 can calculate the imaginary part\nof the momentum using the dispersion\u0001 relation p2 = E 2 \u2212 m2 + 2E Vopt (p, E) approximating \u03a0 = 2E Vopt by\n2\nignoring terms of the order O Vopt\n/m2 . Instead of solving the real and imaginary parts of the dispersion relation,\n\u0002 \u0003\nHecking approximates the real part of the dispersion relation by thehvacuum solution R p2 = Ei2 \u2212 m2 and uses this\np\n\u0002 \u0003\napproximation in the equation for the imaginary part I p2 = \u2212I 2E Vopt (p, E = p2 + m2 ) . This last equation\nnow defines also I [p], which can be used in equation (11) to obtain the mean free path. To minimize Coulomb effects,\nhe defines an averaged mean free path\n\u03bbavg =\n\n1\n(\u03bb\u03c0+ + \u03bb\u03c0\u2212 ) .\n2\n\nIn order to compare to his results we have performed a calculation without Coulomb forces. In fig. 10, Hecking's\nresults are compared to the full BUU calculations. As a most prominent feature one observes that our results are much\nlower than Hecking's over the full energy range. The work by Mehrem et al. (41) explains this discrepancy. Solving\nthe full dispersion relation with an optical potential calculated by J. A. Carr 1 , it reports a mean free path of the pion\nwhich is smaller than Hecking's result. In this work the large difference is attributed to Hecking's approximations\ndescribed above.\nAs a benchmark for our model, the result of Mehrem et al. (41) for the mean free path is shown in fig. 9 in\ncomparison to our result obtained with the BUU simulation 2 . Including the hadronic potential in our model we\nnotice that the mean free path decreases considerably at low pion kinetic energies. There the hadronic potential\n\n1\n2\n\nThe parameters are given in (41)\nvac = 0. A direct\nThe real part of Vopt , which is used in Mehrem's work, is very strong at low energies with Vopt \u2248 48 MeV at Ekin\ncomparison by including this real part in our semi-classical model is, therefore, not possible.\n\n\f14\nbecomes repulsive with V & Ekin and the semi-classical model breaks down, as mentioned earlier. In contrast to this,\nquantum mechanics allows for tunneling, i. e. propagation, into such classically forbidden regions.\nA proper discussion of the mean free path is obviously important in the analysis of experiments with final state\npions being produced inside the nuclear medium. When working in a quantum mechanical framework solving the full\ndispersion relation, as done e.g. by Mehrem et al., is very important. Ad hoc assumptions have a large effect on the\npion mean free path and this has a dramatic effect on any final state analysis.\nSince the mean free path is not directly observable, it is ultimately an open question whether transport gives a\nreasonable mean free path for the pion. This can only be answered by experiment. A test for our model assumptions\nwill, therefore, be absorption cross sections which we address in the next paragraph.\nB. The scattering of pions off nuclei\n\nLow-energy pion scattering experiments have been studied extensively with elementary targets (e.g. (25; 27; 28; 46)),\nhowever, there exist only a few data points for pions scattering off complex nuclei (47; 48; 49; 50; 51; 52; 53).\nThe total cross section (51; 52; 53) includes the coherent contribution which would have to be substracted, before\ncomparing them to our results (for a discussion on this issue see e.g. (47)). We study here solely reaction, charge\nexchange (CX) and absorption cross sections. In the considered energy regime, reaction and CX cross section measurements are rare (47; 48). In fig. 13 we present our results for reaction and CX cross sections for 12 C and 209 Bi.\nThe overall agreement with the few existing data points is satisfactory. Fortunately, the experimental situation for\nabsorption cross sections (47; 49; 50) is more promising. Therefore, this observable can be used to evaluate the quality\nof our model.\n\n\u03c3reac/CX (mb)\n\n\u03c0+ on C\n\n\u03c0- on C\n\nreac\nCX\n100\n10\n1\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120 0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n+\n\n\u03c0 on Bi\n\u03c3reac/CX (mb)\n\n60\n\n80 100 120\n\n-\n\n\u03c0 on Bi\n\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120 0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120\n\nFIG. 13 Reaction (\"reac\"; solid lines) and charge exchange (\"CX\"; dashed lines) cross sections for\npoints are taken from (47) (open circles: \u03c3CX , open squares: \u03c3reac ) and (48) (full quares: \u03c3reac ).\n\n12\n\nC and\n\n209\n\nBi. The data\n\nIn a quantum mechanical approach one cannot calculate absorption cross sections in the general case. Only at very\nlow energies, where the quasielastic contribution to the total reaction cross section is negligible, such an absorption\ncross section can be obtained(e.g. (38)). One thus relies on eikonal approximations to split the reaction cross section\ninto a quasi-elastic and absorptive part. On the contrary, in the BUU simulation the calculation of an absorption\ncross section is straightforward due to the semi-classical treatment.\nIn figures 14 and 15 we show calculations for different nuclei and different bombarding energies of the pions.\nComparing the curves obtained without any potential (dotted) to those with the Coulomb potential included (dashed),\nwe see that the Coulomb potential alone has only a small influence on light nuclei (fig. 14), but is very important at\nlow energies for heavy nuclei (fig. 15). Its long range leads to a sizeable deformation of the trajectories already long\n\n\f15\nbefore the pions reach the nucleus. Therefore the negative pions can interact with the nucleus even if they have large\nimpact parameter while the positive pions are deflected. In presence of the Coulomb potential we see a reduction\nof the cross section for the \u03c0 + and a large increase of the cross section for the \u03c0 \u2212 . This agrees to the findings of\nNieves et al. (54), who pointed out the relevance of the Coulomb potential in their quantum mechanical calculation\nof absorption and reaction cross sections.\nWhen one includes the hadronic potential for the pion, another overall effect sets in. Once the pion enters the\nnucleus it is influenced by the short-range hadronic potential, which amounts to \u221240 MeV at high momenta and to\n+20 MeV at low momenta, as well as the Coulomb potential which amounts to roughly \u00b110 MeV in a medium size\nnucleus, and to roughly \u00b120 MeV in the case of Pb. At very low energies the two potentials nearly compensate for\nthe negative pion, while they add up to a strongly repulsive potential in the case of a \u03c0 + .\nIn fig. 14 we see a fair agreement on C and Al with the data, when the hadronic potential is included. Addressing\nheavier nuclei, fig. 15 shows the absorption cross sections for Cu, Sn and Au. The overall agreement to data is very\ngood if the hadronic potential is included, especially for Sn and Au. The curves which include a hadronic potential\nfor the pion show a prominent kink structure at roughly 30 MeV (20 MeV) for the positive (negative) pion. This kink\nis caused by the repulsive character of the pion potential at low energies. On one hand, the mean free path decreases\nrapidly at very low energies (compare fig. 9) - this causes the absorption cross section to rise. On the other hand, the\nrepulsive potential pushes the pions out of the nucleus or even reflects them. Below the kink the repulsive feature is\nmore prominent; above the kink the decreasing mean free path is more important.\nAs a conclusion, we find that it is critical to include Coulomb corrections. On top, the absorption cross sections\nare sensitive to the hadronic potential of the pion, i.e. to the real part of the self energy in the medium. As we have\nalready seen in fig. 10, the mean free path is quite insensitive to the hadronic potential except at very low energies.\nWe thus conclude that the modification of the trajectories of the pion is the main effect of the hadronic potential.\nIn its repulsive regime the hadronic potential pushes the pion outwards and the overall path of the pion inside the\nnucleus becomes shorter. Therefore the probability of absorption is decreased. The attractive behavior at larger\nenergies causes the opposite effect.\nThe overall agreement to the data is satisfactory in spite of some discrepancies, especially in Al and Cu. Considering\nthe fact that the pions have very large wave lengths at such low energies, the success of the semi-classical BUU model\nis quite astonishing. Due to the large wave length one expects also many-body correlations and quantum interference\neffects to be important.

Overview\n\nWe now discuss the consequences of the pion mean free path on recent double pion production data off nuclei, which\nhave been interpreted as a source of information about the spectral density in the \u03c3 channel in nuclear matter (9; 57).\nAlready in (13) we have presented results on the double-pion photoproduction off nuclei using the transport approach. There the treatment of the pion final state differed from the treatment presented in the previous sections.\nIn order to compare to a work by Roca et al. (57), we implemented there the same absorption probability for the\npion as in their work. Therefore we did not propagate the resonances explicitly, but rather used experimental data\nto describe the quasi-elastic N \u03c0 \u2192 N \u03c0 scattering. We also used contributions to the imaginary part of the optical\n\n\f17\n0 0\n\n0 0\n\n\u03b3p\u2192p\u03c0 \u03c0\n\n\u03b3n\u2192n\u03c0 \u03c0\n6\n\n7\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n8\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0.26 0.28\n\n0.3\n\n0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.4\n\n0.42\n\n0.26 0.28\n\n0 +\n\n0.4\n\n0.42\n\n\u03b3n\u2192p\u03c0 \u03c0\n40\n\n25\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n0 -\n\n\u03b3p\u2192n\u03c0 \u03c0\n30\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4 0.42\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4 0.42\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n+ -\n\n+ -\n\n\u03b3p\u2192p\u03c0 \u03c0\n\n\u03b3n\u2192n\u03c0 \u03c0\n\n120\n\n80\n\n100\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n0.3\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4 0.42\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4 0.42\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\nFIG. 16 Two pion invariant mass distributions for \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 photoproduction off the proton and neutron obtained from\nthe model of (55; 56).

Data for E\u03b3 = 0.4 \u2212 0.46 GeV are taken from (9).\n\npotential of (38) to model pion absorption. The aim there was to indicate the relevant role of conventional final-state\ninteraction (FSI) effects in two-pion photoproduction in nuclei.\nThe authors of (57) achieved quite an impressive agreement with the experimental data, when studying double pion\nproduction in a many-body approach which allowed for pion-pion correlations. However their treatment of the pion\nFSI was based upon a purely absorptive Glauber damping-factor calculated along straight line trajectories.\nIn the previous section we have shown that our transport approach is still reliable in the regime of long pionic wave\nlengths. Since there is no fully quantum description for the incoherent 2\u03c0 reaction available, we utilize the semiclassical final state description to simulate the \u03c0\u03c0-photo production experiment performed by the TAPS collaboration\n(9; 10; 11; 12). Originally this experiment was intended to concentrate on the lower 400 MeV \u2264 E\u03b3 \u2264 460 MeV bin,\nfocusing on the threshold behavior of the \u03c0\u03c0 channel. Lately the experiment has evaluated a larger energy bin for the\nphoton energy in order to enhance statistics. Therefore, also results for the larger bin with 400 MeV \u2264 E\u03b3 \u2264 500 MeV\nare presented here.\n\n\f18\n\n+ 0\n2\n\nd\u03c3/dm\u03c0 \u03c0/dp [\u03bcb/GeV ]\n\n\u03b3 p\u2192n\u03c0 \u03c0\n0\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\np[GeV]\n\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0[GeV]\n\n0 0\n2\n\nd\u03c3/dm\u03c0 \u03c0/dp [\u03bcb/GeV ]\n\n\u03b3 p\u2192p\u03c0 \u03c0\n0\n\np[GeV]\n\n0.05\n50\n0.1\n0.15\n\n0\n\n0.2\n0.25\n0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0[GeV]\n\nFIG. 17 The cross section dmd\u03c3\nfor \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 photoproduction off the proton at E\u03b3 = 0.45 GeV.

Model for the elementary reaction\n\nFor the elementary two pion production process on the nucleon we exploit the model of (55; 56). This model\nprovides a reliable input for the mass distributions of the pions in the elementary process. The total production\ncross sections are chosen according to the model in those channels where the agreement to data is satisfactory\n(\u03b3p \u2192 n\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 ,\u03b3n \u2192 n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). In the remaining ones the model predicts lower total cross sections than those observed\nin experiment at the energy of interest for us. Hence, we use directly the data measured by the TAPS and the\nDAPHNE collaborations (58; 59; 60; 61; 62) to normalize the calculated cross sections, while we take the decay\nmass distributions from theory. The implemented elementary invariant-mass distributions are presented in fig. 16\nfor both a neutron and a proton target. Presently, only data for invariant mass distributions on a proton target are\navailable. The solid curves in fig. 16 represent the results of the elementary model (55; 56) for \u03c0\u03c0 production for\nE\u03b3 = 400 \u2212 460 MeV compared to the experimental data. The model describes the shape of the data quite well;\nfor the semi-charged channel the cross section is somewhat underestimated. The dashed curves in fig. 16 show the\npredictions for E\u03b3 = 400 \u2212 500 MeV.\nTo illustrate the momentum distribution of the pions, we concentrate on a \u03b3p reaction with a fixed photon energy\n\n\f19\n0 \u00b1\n\n0 0\n\n\u03b3C\u2192X\u03c0 \u03c0\n\n\u03b3C\u2192X\u03c0 \u03c0\n\n0.45\n\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0.25\n\n0.45\n\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0.25\n\n3.5\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n4\n\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.3\n\n0 0\n\n\u03b3 Ca \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.3\n\n0.45\n\n\u03b3 Pb \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n25\n\n3\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n0 \u00b1\n\n0 0\n\n\u03b3 Pb \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n3.5\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0.25\n\n0.45\n\n0 \u00b1\n\n\u03b3 Ca \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n4\n\n0\n0.25\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.45\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.45\n\nFIG. 18 Two pion invariant mass distributions for \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 photoproduction off 12 C, 40 Ca and 208 Pb for E\u03b3 = 0.4 \u2212\n0.46 GeV.

Most of the pions are produced with momenta around 120 MeV, corresponding to Ekin \u2248 44 MeV, i.e.\njust at the lower limit of the applicability of our semi-classical model at \u03c10 . Note that the momenta of the produced\npions range between 0 \u2212 250 MeV. In nuclei, the FSI is therefore dominated by the \u2206 resonance, S-wave scattering\nand the N N \u03c0 \u2192 N N process.\n3.

As already\ndiscussed in (13), we observe that absorption, elastic scattering and charge exchange processes cause a considerable\nchange of the spectra with the peak of the mass distribution moving to lower masses due to rescattering.\nThe hadronic potential for the pion causes only a minor effect, so the observed reaction is rather insensitive to this\n\n\f20\n0 \u00b1\n\n0 0\n\n\u03b3C\u2192X\u03c0 \u03c0\n30\n\n5\n\n25\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n\u03b3C\u2192X\u03c0 \u03c0\n6\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.25\n\n0.45\n\n0.3\n\n0 0\n\n5\n\n25\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n\u03b3 Ca \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n30\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.25\n\n0.45\n\n0.3\n\n30\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\nd\u03c3\u03c0 \u03c0/dm\u03c0 \u03c0 [\u03bcb/GeV/A]\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.45\n\n\u03b3 Pb \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n35\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n0 \u00b1\n\n0 0\n\n\u03b3 Pb \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n6\n\n0\n0.25\n\n0.45\n\n0 \u00b1\n\n\u03b3 Ca \u2192 X \u03c0 \u03c0\n6\n\n0\n0.25\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.45\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n0.4\nm\u03c0 \u03c0 [GeV]\n\n0.45\n\nFIG. 19 Two pion invariant mass distributions for \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 photoproduction off 12 C, 40 Ca and 208 Pb for E\u03b3 = 0.4 \u2212\n0.5 GeV.

This can be understood by analysing the production points of those pion pairs which are not\nabsorbed and which are, finally, observed. In fig. 20 the cross section for \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 production off Pb at 500 MeV is shown\nas function of the production point R of the pair. Without FSI the distribution d\u03c3\u03c00 \u03c00 /dR is proportional to \u03c1(R)R2 ;\nincluding FSI the distribution is shifted and centered around 6.8 fm which corresponds to roughly \u03c1 = 0.076 fm\u22123 .\nHence, the potential has a minor effect on the observed pions due to the low density at the initial production point.\nSince the mean free path increases at lower momentum, a cut that keeps only low-momentum pions could reduce\nthe sensitivity of the whole production process to the \u03c0-nucleus FSI. On the other hand, this would complicate\nthe theoretical treatment of the process considerably, since quantum mechanical effects would become even more\nimportant.\nFirst experimental results for this process have been presented in (9). Recently, those data have been reanalyzed\nby the TAPS collaboration. The preliminary results of this analysis can be found in (11; 12), and a comparison\nof the former results to this new analysis is given in (10). The old analysis is being re-evaluated, especially in the\nsemi-charged channel. Therefore, we do not present these data sets here.

The pion FSI reaction mechanism incorporated in the model and its uncertainties\nhave been discussed in the preceding sections. The influence of the uncertainty in the elementary cross sections is\nillustrated in fig. 21. The three curves shown in each plot use as input either the given data points or, simultaneously\nfor all data sets, the lower and upper bounds. One has to note, that \u03b3n \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and especially\n\u03b3n \u2192 n\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 (60) are sources of uncertainty in the elementary cross sections. We emphasize, that this scenario of\nsimultaneous lower and upper bounds instead of a computational intensive \u03c7-squared-analysis is only meant to give\nan estimate for the error. The statistical error due to the Monte-Carlo method was estimated to be about 2% by\ncomparing parallel runs, being therefore negligible.\nTo summarize this section we emphasize that final state interactions of the pions are strong and tend to shift the\nmaximum of the \u03c0\u03c0 mass distribution in all channels towards lower masses. This effect considerably complicates\ndrawing a link between the experimental data and a possible softening of the in-medium I = 0 channel. Any\ntheory aiming to describe the observed effect on the basis of a partial chiral symmetry restoration or an in-medium\nmodification of the \u03c0\u03c0 production process must take the final state effects into account.\nIV. SUMMARY\n\nIn this work we have presented the treatment of low-energy pions within the GiBUU transport model. In particular,\nwe have studied the mean free path and compared to optical model results. Studying the long wave-length region,\n\n\f22\nwe have pointed out the problem with pion energies below 20 MeV due to the semi-classical treatment in our model.\nAs a benchmark, we have investigated pion absorption cross sections with very good agreement to experimental data\nfrom light to heavy nuclei. At low energies, we have found a strong dependence of this observable on the Coulomb\npotential and the pion hadronic potential. Finally, we have shown predictions for \u03b3A \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0A in the regime of\n400 MeV \u2264 E\u03b3 \u2264 500 MeV and also new calculations for 400 MeV \u2264 E\u03b3 \u2264 460 MeV. We emphasize, that the link\nfrom \u03c0\u03c0 photoproduction experiments to underlying effects like a possible softening of the in-medium \u03c0\u03c0 interaction\nis considerably complicated by the necessary presence of pion final state interactions which also shifts the \u03c0\u03c0 invariant\nmass distributions towards lower masses.\nV.
