The idea is to consider an infinite dimensional\nsubbundle - or more generally an essential subbundle - of the tangent bundle of M , suitably\nrelated with the gradient flow of f . This Part I deals with the following questions about\nthe intersection W of the unstable manifold of a critical point x and the stable manifold of\nanother critical point y: finite dimensionality of W , possibility that different components of\nW have different dimension, orientability of W and coherence in the choice of an orientation,\ncompactness of the closure of W , classification, up to topological conjugacy, of the gradient\nflow on the closure of W , in the case dim W = 2.\n\nIntroduction\nMorse theory [Mor25] relates the topology of a compact differentiable manifold M to the combinatorics of the critical points of a smooth Morse function f : M \u2192 R: if \u03b2q (M ) = rank Hq (M )\ndenotes the q-th Betti number of M , and cq (f ) is the number of critical points x of f with Morse\nindex m(x) = q, then the identity\ndim\nXM\n\ncq (f )tq =\n\nq=0\n\ndim\nXM\n\n\u03b2q (M )tq + (1 + t)Q(t),\n\n(1)\n\nq=0\n\nholds, with Q a polynomial with positive integer coefficients. Denoting by Cq (f ) the free Abelian\ngroup generated by the critical points of f of index q, q = 0, 1, . . . , dim M , it is readily seen that\n(1) is implied1 by the existence of homomorphisms \u2202q : Cq (f ) \u2192 Cq\u22121 (f ) making {C\u2217 (f ), \u2202\u2217 } a\nchain complex, whose homology groups are isomorphic to the singular Z-homology groups of M :\nHq ({C\u2217 (f ), \u2202\u2217 }) =\n\nker \u2202q \u223c\n= Hq (M ).\nran \u2202q+1\n\n(2)\n\nA chain complex with the above properties is indeed provided by a suitable cellular filtration of\nM . More precisely, if we fix a Riemannian structure on M such that the corresponding gradient\nflow of f , i.e. the integral flow \u03c6 : R \u00d7 M \u2192 M of the vector field \u2212grad f , is Morse-Smale2, then\nthe open subsets\n[\n\u03c6([0, +\u221e[\u00d7Ux ), q = 0, 1, . . . , dim M,\nM q :=\nx\u2208crit(f )\nm(x)\u2264q\n\n\u2217 Scuola\n\nNormale Superiore di Pisa, Piazza dei Cavalieri 7, 56126 Pisa, Italy, e-mail: abbo@sns.it.\ndi Matematica \"L. Tonelli\", via Buonarroti 2, 56127 Pisa, Italy, e-mail: majer@dm.unipi.it\n1 The two facts would actually be equivalent if we were using coefficients in a field, instead of the ring Z.\n2 Here one needs just that the unstable manifold W u (x) and the stable manifold W s (y) have empty intersection,\nfor every pair of distinct critical points x, y with m(x) \u2264 m(y).\n\u2020 Dipartimento\n\n1\n\n\ffor Ux a suitable small neighborhood of x, constitute a cellular filtration of M , such that\nHq (M q , M q\u22121 ) \u223c\n= Cq (f ).\nSo we get the boundary homomorphism\n\u2202q : Cq (f ) \u223c\n= Hq (M q , M q\u22121 ) \u2192 Hq\u22121 (M q\u22121 , M q\u22122 ) \u223c\n= Cq\u22121 (f ),\n\n(3)\n\nand the classical isomorphism between the homology of the cellular chain complex (3) and the\nsingular homology of M (see [Dol80], section V.1) implies (2).\nThe boundary homomorphism \u2202q constructed above has also the following combinatorial description, in terms of the intersections between the unstable manifolds W u (x) and the stable manifolds W s (y) of pairs of critical points3 . Since dim W u (x) = m(x) and dim W s (y) = dim M \u2212 m(y),\nthe intersection W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is a submanifold of dimension m(x) \u2212 m(y). An arbitrary choice\nof an orientation for each unstable manifold W u (x) determines a co-orientation (i.e. an orientation\nof the normal bundle) for each stable manifold W s (x), and thus an orientation for each intersection4 W u (x) \u2229 W s (y). When m(x) = q and m(y) = q \u2212 1, W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) consists of finitely\nmany gradient flow lines, each of which can be counted as +1 or as \u22121, depending on whether\nits orientation agrees with the direction of the gradient flow or not. The algebraic sum of these\nnumbers gives an integer n(x, y), and \u2202q can be expressed in terms of the generators of Cq (f ) and\nCq\u22121 (f ) as\nX\nn(x, y) y, for x \u2208 crit(f ), m(x) = q.\n(4)\n\u2202q x =\ny\u2208crit(f )\nm(y)=q\u22121\n\nThe Morse complex {C\u2217 (f ), \u2202\u2217 } depends on the choice of the Riemannian structure on M (a\ndifferent Riemannian structure would produce a different gradient flow) and on the choice of the\norientations of the unstable manifolds, but the isomorphism class of such a chain complex depends\njust on the function f .\nThe approach described above was essentially clear to the pioneers of Morse theory, such as\nThom [Tho49] and Milnor [Mil63, Mil65], and to people in dynamical systems, such as Smale\n[Sma60, Sma61, Sma67] and Franks [Fra79, Fra80], but it has received increasing attention after\nthe works of Witten [Wit82] and Floer [Flo89]. See the systematic study by Schwarz [Sch93], and\nWeber's thesis [Web93]. The observation on the invariance of the isomorphism class of the Morse\ncomplex is due to Cornea and Ranicki [CR03], together with more striking rigidity results.\nAlready in the sixties, Morse theory had been generalized to infinite dimensional Hilbert manifolds (manifolds modeled on a Hilbert space) by Palais [Pal63], and Smale [Sma64a, Sma64b],\nand had been successfully applied to many variational problems (see the expository papers of Bott\n[Bot82, Bot88], the books of Klingenberg [Kli78, Kli82], of Mawhin and Willem [MW89], of Chang\n[Cha93], and references therein). Indeed, the compactness of M can be replaced by a compactness\nassumption on f , the well known Palais-Smale condition ((PS) for short): any sequence (pn ) \u2282 M\nsuch that f (pn ) is bounded and kDf (pn )k is infinitesimal must be compact. If M is a Hilbert\nmanifold endowed with a complete Riemannian structure, and f \u2208 C 2 (M, R) is a Morse function,\nbounded below and satisfying (PS), then the Morse relations (1) still hold, the difference being\nthat now (1) is an equality between formal power series, with coefficients in N \u222a {\u221e}.\nHowever, (1) takes into account only critical points with finite Morse index, the ultimate reason\nbeing that the closed ball of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space is retractable onto its boundary,\nso that critical points with infinite Morse index are invisible to homotopy theory. It was Floer\n[Flo88a, Flo88b, Flo88c, Flo89] who observed that the Morse complex approach is suitable to deal\nwith critical points of infinite Morse index and co-index: even if the unstable and stable manifolds\nare infinite dimensional, one may still hope the dimension of their intersection to be finite. In\n3 Here\n\none needs that W u (x) and W s (y) meet transversally just when m(x) \u2212 m(y) \u2264 1.\nby transversality, a normal bundle of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) in W u (x) is also the restriction of a normal\nbundle of W s (y) in M , so it is oriented, and together with the orientation of W u (x), it determines an orientation\nof W u (x) \u2229 W s (y). Notice that the manifold M needs not be orientable.\n4 Indeed\n\n2\n\n\fthis case, one could try to see (4) not as a description, but rather as the definition of a chain\ncomplex. In this way, Floer was able to develop the analogue of Morse theory in a case where the\ngradient flow ODE is replaced by a Cauchy-Riemann type PDE, which does not even determine\na local flow (so that there are no stable and unstable manifolds). The resulting theory, known as\nFloer homology, plays now a central role in symplectic geometry (see [HZ94, Sal99] and references\ntherein).\nIn the present paper, and in the forthcoming Part II, we introduce and study the Morse complex\nfor gradient-like flows on infinite dimensional Hilbert manifolds. The results we present are a far\nreaching generalization of a previous work on a special class of functionals on Hilbert spaces\n[AM01]. See also [AvdV99] for a construction of the Morse complex for the energy functional\nof an elliptic system, and Chapter 6 in Jost's book [Jos02] for a general approach to the Morse\ncomplex. More precisely, we give an answer to the following questions.\n(i) When is W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) a finite dimensional manifold?\n(ii) How can we give coherent orientations to the manifolds W u (x) \u2229 W s (y)?\n(iii) When is the closure of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) compact?\n(iv) Having defined \u2202q by (4), how do we prove that \u2202q\u22121 \u25e6 \u2202q = 0?\n(v) Which form of transversality is generic?\n(vi) How do we recover the classical infinite dimensional Morse theory?\n(vii) How can we compute the homology of the Morse complex?\nIn the present paper we address questions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), leaving questions (v), (vi), and\n(vii) to Part II. We wish to emphasize the fact that these questions are only formally analogue\nto corresponding issues in Floer homology. Indeed, since in our case the gradient-like vector\nfield determines a C 1 local flow, some of the problems above can be dealt by dynamical systems\ntechniques. On the other hand, finite dimensionality and compactness results do not come from\nelliptic estimates, but involve different ideas. In particular, the study of some infinite dimensional\nGrassmannians, of ordinary differential operators on Hilbert spaces, and the use of Hausdorff\nmeasures of non-compactness turn out to be important tools.\nWe conclude this introduction by giving an informal description of our results.\nFinite dimensional intersections. Let f be a C 2 Morse function on a paracompact Hilbert\nmanifold M . Let F be a C 1 Morse vector field on M , having f as a non-degenerate Lyapunov\nfunction: this means that Df (p)[F (p)] < 0 for every p \u2208 M which is not a rest point of F , that\nthe Jacobian of F at every rest point x - denoted by \u2207F (x) - is a hyperbolic operator, and that\nthe quadratic form D2 f (x) is coercive on V \u2212 (\u2207F (x)), the negative eigenspace of \u2207F (x), while\n\u2212D2 f (x) is coercive on the positive eigenspace V + (\u2207F (x)). Under these assumptions, x is a rest\npoint of F if and only if it is a critical point of f . Typically, F = \u2212grad f , the negative gradient\nof f with respect to some Riemannian metric on M , or F = \u2212h grad f , for some positive function\nh.\nThe unstable and stable manifolds of a critical point x are C 1 submanifolds of dimension the\nMorse index and co-index of x. When the critical points x and y have infinite index and co-index,\nrespectively, the intersection W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) can be infinite dimensional: consider for example the\nrestriction of a continuous linear form f on a Hilbert space H to the unit sphere S of H. Its critical\npoints are a maximum point x and a minimum point \u2212x, and W u (x) \u2229 W s (\u2212x) = S \\ {x, \u2212x}.\nWhat is more striking, if x and y are critical points of f with infinite Morse index and co-index,\nthe dimension of the intersection between their unstable and stable manifolds (with respect to the\nnegative gradient flow of f ) depends on the metric on M : indeed, if all the critical points of a\nMorse function f have infinite Morse index and co-index, and a : crit(f ) \u2192 Z is any function,\nthen M supports a metric g - uniformly equivalent to a given one - such that the corresponding\n3\n\n\fnegative gradient flow of f has the property that for every pair of critical points x, y the intersection\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is transverse and has dimension a(x) \u2212 a(y) (see [AM04b]).\nTherefore, some extra structure on the manifold M is needed: we will assume the existence of\na subbundle V of T M , which can be used to make comparisons. More precisely, the object of our\nstudy will be a quartet (M, F, f, V), where f is a non-degenerate Lyapunov function for the Morse\nvector field F , and the subbundle V of T M is compatible to F , meaning that:\n\n(C1) for every rest point x, V + (\u2207F (x)), the positive eigenspace of the Jacobian of F at x, is\na compact perturbation of V(x) (this means that the corresponding orthogonal projectors\nhave compact difference);\n\n(C2) denoting by P a projector onto V, (LF P)(p)P(p) is a compact linear operator on Tp M , for\nevery p \u2208 M (here LF P denotes the Lie derivative of the tensor P along the vector field F ).\nAssumption (C1) allows us to define the relative Morse index of a rest point x with respect to V\nto be the integer\nm(x, V) := dim(V + (\u2207F (x)), V(x)) = dim V + (\u2207f (x)) \u2229 V(x)\u22a5 \u2212 dim V \u2212 (\u2207F (x)) \u2229 V(x).\nNotice that m(x, V) can be negative. A subbundle V = P(T M ) is invariant for the differential of\nthe integral flow of a vector field X if and only if (LX P)P = 0. Assumption (C2) says that V\nis essentially invariant for the linearized flow of F , meaning that the differential of the flow of F\nmaps V into a compact perturbation of V. Assumptions (C1) and (C2) are automatically fulfilled\nwhen all the critical points have finite index, by choosing V = (0): in this case m(x, (0)) is the\nusual Morse index.\nOur first result will be that if (C1) and (C2) hold, and W u (x), W s (y) meet transversally, then\ntheir intersection is finite dimensional, and\ndim W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) = m(x, V) \u2212 m(y, V),\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is the first step for the construction of the Morse complex. A useful tool, in the proof of this\nresult and in transversality questions, will be the study, presented in [AM03b], of the Fredholm\nproperties of the differential operator\nd\n\u2212 A(t) : C01 (R, H) \u2192 C00 (R, H),\ndt\nwhere the subscript 0 means vanishing at infinity, and A is a continuous path of bounded operators\non the Hilbert space H, converging to hyperbolic operators for t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\nAs we shall see, the usefulness of conditions (C1) and (C2) lies in the fact that they are both\nstable and convex.\nIn many cases, the choice of the subbundle V for which (C1) and (C2) hold, is suggested by\nthe problem itself: for example, this is the case of semi-linear equations, where f is a lower order\nperturbation of a non-degenerate quadratic form on a Hilbert space, and of many functionals\ncoming from geometric problems, such as the energy of curves on a semi-Riemannian manifold.\nIn other cases, (C1) and (C2) just hold locally: one finds an open covering {Uj | j \u2208 J} of M\nand subbundles Vj of T Uj , which satisfy (C1), (C2), and are such that Vi |Ui \u2229Uj is a compact\nperturbation of Vj |Ui \u2229Uj , for any i, j \u2208 J. That is, (C1) and (C2) hold with respect to an essential\nsubbundle. In such a situation the intersection of the unstable and stable manifolds are finite\ndimensional, but no formula like (5) can possibly hold. Indeed, we will show an example of a\nMorse function on S 1 \u00d7 H, H an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, with two rest points x, y, such\nthat different components of the transverse intersection W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) have different dimension.\nThis is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, related to the fact that the general linear group\nof an infinite dimensional Hilbert space is contractible (see [Kui65]). Formula (5) will hold in the\nintermediate situation in which dim(Vi , Vj ) = 0 for every i, j \u2208 J: in this case we will say that\n(C1) and (C2) hold with respect to a (0)-essential subbundle.\nThese facts are closely related to Cohen, Jones, and Segal's use of polarizations to understand\nthe the homotopy theory which lies behind Floer homology [CJS95].\n4\n\n\fCoherent orientations. As we have seen, when M is finite dimensional - or more generally\nwhen the rest points have finite Morse index - W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is orientable. In the case of infinite\nMorse indices and co-indices, however, W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) needs not be orientable: indeed we will\nprovide an example showing that such a transverse intersection can be diffeomorphic to Z \u00d7 R,\nwhere Z is any manifold.\nThe existence of a subbundle V satisfying (C1) and (C2) will imply that all the intersections\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y) are orientable, and it will allow us to define their orientations in a coherent way.\nThe starting point is the fact that Fredholm pairs (i.e. pairs (V, W ) of closed linear subspaces of\na Hilbert space H with dim V \u2229 W < \u221e, codim(V + W ) < \u221e) can be oriented: an orientation of\n(V, W ) is by definition an orientation of the finite dimensional space (V \u2229 W ) \u00d7 (H/(V + W ))\u2217 .\nActually, a determinant bundle can be defined on the space of Fredholm pairs, extending the\ndeterminant bundle on the space of Fredholm operators, defined by Quillen [Qui85]. Together\nwith the fact that the fundamental group of the space of Fredholm pairs (V, W ) with dim V =\ndim W = \u221e, is Z2 , this implies that the notion of orientation of a Fredholm pair shares all the\ngood properties of orientations of finite dimensional spaces.\nFor every rest point x, one fixes an orientation of the Fredholm pair (Tx W s (x), V(x)). Assumptions (C1) and (C2) guarantee that (Tp W s (x), V(p)) is a Fredholm pair, for every p \u2208 W s (x).\nHence, the orientation chosen at x propagates to all the stable manifold of x. The way of orienting\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is then similar to what we have described in the case of a finite dimensional M .\nIf conditions (C1) and (C2) hold with respect to a (0)-essential subbundle, coherent orientations\ncannot be defined, and one obtains just a Morse complex with Z2 coefficients. Bott periodicity\ntheorem [Bot59] can be used to find the obstructions to have a Morse complex with integer\ncoefficients: they are given by the homotopy groups \u03c0i (M ), with i \u2261 1, 2, 3, 5 mod 8.\nRelative compactness of the intersections. When the rest point x has a finite Morse index,\nthe (PS) condition5 and the completeness of the flow imply that the intersection W u (x)\u2229W s (y) has\ncompact closure in M . When the indices are infinite, even if (C1-2) guarantee that W u (x)\u2229W s (y)\nis finite dimensional, we cannot conclude that its closure is compact: for instance, it may consist\nof infinitely many isolated curves, with no cluster points besides x and y.\nThe reason is that (C1-2) are local assumptions, while compactness involves a global condition:\nwe shall need a global version of condition (C2). Let us assume for simplicity that the subbundle\nV of T M has a global presentation, that is a submersion Q : M \u2192 N into a complete Riemannian\nHilbert manifold N such that V(p) = ker DQ(p). We will denote by \u03b2X (A) the Hausdorff measure\nof non-compactness of the subset A of a metric space X, that is the infimum of all positive numbers\nr such that A can be covered by finitely many balls of radius r. The new assumption is:\n(C3) (i) DQ \u25e6 F is bounded;\n\n(ii) for every q \u2208 N there exist \u03b4 > 0 and c \u2265 0 such that \u03b2T N (DQ(F (A))) \u2264 c \u03b2N (Q(A)),\nfor any A in a Q\u22121 (B\u03b4 (q)).\n\nThis condition implies (C2) by differentiation. Condition (C3) is also stable and convex, in a sense\nto be specified.\nWe shall prove that conditions (C1) and (C3), together with (PS) and the completeness of the\nflow, imply that W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) has compact closure in M , for every pair of critical points x, y.\nThis compactness result will be proved in the more general setting of a flow which preserves\nan essentially vertical family F of subsets of M , with respect to a strong integrable structure for\nan essential subbundle E of T M . When E is the essential class of a subbundle V with a global\npresentation Q, one chooses F to be the family of subsets A \u2282 M such that Q(A) is pre-compact.\nMore-generally, one can deal with a suitable presentation of E consisting of an open covering\n{Mi }i\u2208I of M and of semi-Fredholm maps with non-negative index Qi : Mi \u2192 Ni , such that\nE(p) = [ker DQ(p)] for every p \u2208 Mi .\n5 In this contest, a (PS) sequence is a sequence (p ) \u2282 M such that (f (p )) is bounded and (Df (p )[F (p )]) is\nn\nn\nn\nn\ninfinitesimal.\n\n5\n\n\fThe boundary homomorphism. Assume that (M, F, f, V) satisfies (C1-3) and (PS), and that\nthe stable and unstable manifolds of rest points meet transversally. For q \u2208 Z, we can define Cq (F )\nto be the free Abelian group generated by the rest points x with m(x, V) = q. In order to define\nthe homomorphism \u2202q : Cq (F ) \u2192 Cq\u22121 (F ), we just need the last condition\n(C4) for any q \u2208 Z, f is bounded below on the set of critical points x of relative Morse index\nm(x, V) = q,\nwhich guarantees that the sum appearing in (4) is finite.\nThe boundary property \u2202q\u22121 \u25e6 \u2202q = 0 comes from the possibility of describing exactly the\nflow on the closure of each component of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y), when m(x, V) \u2212 m(y, V) = 2: such\na flow is either topologically conjugated to the exponential flow (t, z) 7\u2192 et z on the Riemann\nsphere C \u222a {\u221e}, or it is topologically conjugated to the shift flow (t, (u, v)) 7\u2192 (u + t, v + t)\non [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e]. In the latter case, the orientation of this component is the product\norientation of its sides. These results will be proved by hyperbolic dynamical systems techniques,\nwhich in this case seem more natural than the gluing method used in Floer homology.\nThe resulting complex {C\u2217 (F ), \u2202\u2217 } is said the Morse complex of F . If F1 and F2 are two Morse\nvector fields having the same non-degenerate Lyapunov function f , the Morse complexes of F1\nand of F2 are isomorphic. In particular, their homology depends only on the Lyapunov function\nf , and it will be said the Morse homology of f and denoted by H\u2217 (f ).\nTransversality. The transversality of the intersection of stable and unstable manifolds will be\nachieved by perturbing the vector field F . Small perturbations in a suitable class of vector fields\nkeep the conditions (C1-4) and (PS) valid: in this sense, these conditions were said to be stable.\nWhen one restricts the attention to the class of gradient vector fields, transversality can be achieved\nby using rank 2 perturbations of the given Riemannian metric. A difference with respect to the\nfinite dimensional case is the regularity requirement. Indeed, high regularity of F is needed to\napply Sard-Smale theorem, and such a regularity cannot be obtained by smoothing the vector\nfield F , because C k+1 functions on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space are not C k dense (see\n[NS73, LL86]). As a consequence, we shall assume F \u2208 C 2 (M ), and we will achieve transverse\nintersections of W u (x) and W s (y) whenever m(x, V) \u2212 m(y, V) \u2264 2, which is what we need for the\nconstruction of the Morse complex.\nRelationship with classical infinite dimensional Morse theory. In the case of f bounded\nbelow, satisfying (PS), and with critical points of finite Morse index, we shall prove that the Morse\nhomology of f is isomorphic to the singular homology of M , a result which agrees with the Morse\nrelations proved by Palais. This will be a simple generalization of the cellular filtration argument\ndescribed for the compact case.\nFrom this fact, it is easy to determine the Morse complex of some classes of vector fields\nhaving rest points of infinite Morse index and co-index. For instance, if M = M \u2212 \u00d7 M + is\nthe product of two infinite dimensional Hilbert manifolds, endowed with a complete product\nRiemannian structure, and the Morse function f : M \u2192 R has the special form\nf (p\u2212 , p+ ) = f + (p+ ) \u2212 f \u2212 (p\u2212 ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere f + : M + \u2192 R, f \u2212 : M \u2212 \u2192 R are bounded below and satisfy (PS), then\n\u0013\n\u0012\ngrad f +\ngrad f \u2212\n,\nF =\u2212\n1 + kgrad f \u2212 k2 1 + kgrad f + k2\nsatisfies (C1-3) with respect to the subbundle V = T M \u2212 \u00d7(0), with global presentation the submersion Q : M \u2192 M + , (p\u2212 , p+ ) 7\u2192 p+ . Notice that F has the form F (p\u2212 , p+ ) = (F \u2212 (p\u2212 ), F + (p+ )).\nIt is easy to see that the Morse complex of F is\nM\nCq+ (F + ) \u2297 Cq\u2212 (F \u2212 ), \u2200q \u2208 Z,\nCq (F ) = (C\u2217 (F + ) \u2297 C\u2212\u2217 (F \u2212 ))q =\n(q\u2212 ,q+ )\u2208N2\nq+ \u2212q\u2212 =q\n\n6\n\n\fand the Morse homology of f is\nHq (f ) \u223c\n= (H\u2217 (M + ) \u2297 H\u2212\u2217 (M \u2212 ))q =\n\nM\n\n(q\u2212 ,q+ )\u2208N2\nq+ \u2212q\u2212 =q\n\nHq+ (M + ) \u2297 Hq\u2212 (M \u2212 ),\n\n\u2200q \u2208 Z.\n\n(7)\n\nComputation of the homology and functoriality. In the case of infinite Morse indices and\nco-indices, the topology of M is not immediately related to the Morse homology of f . However,\nthe homology groups Hq (f ) are still considerably stable.\nThe key ingredient to compute the Morse homology groups will be the fact that Morse homology\nis a functor from the class of Morse functions with a gradient-like vector field satisfying (C1-4) and\n(PS), seen as a small category with the usual order relation, to the category of Abelian groups:\nto every inequality f0 \u2265 f1 is associated a homomorphism\n\u03c6f0 f1 : H\u2217 (f0 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (f1 ),\nin such a way that \u03c6f1 f2 \u25e6 \u03c6f0 f1 = \u03c6f0 f2 , and \u03c6f f = id (actually, \u03c6\u03b8\u25e6f f = id, for \u03b8(s) \u2265 s a\nstrictly increasing smooth function). The idea for the definition of \u03c6f0 f1 comes from the following\nobservation: every chain homomorphism \u03c8 : {C\u22170 , \u2202\u22170 } \u2192 {C\u22171 , \u2202\u22171 } comes from a boundary operator\n1\n0\n\u2202q : Cq0 \u2295 Cq+1\n\u2192 Cq\u22121\n\u2295 Cq1 , the cone of \u03c8, namely\n\u2202q =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202q0\n\u03c8\n\n0\n1\n\u2212\u2202q+1\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nWith this in mind, we will construct a Morse function f : R \u00d7 M \u2192 R, of the form\nf (s, p) = \u03c7(s)f0 (p) + (1 \u2212 \u03c7(s))f1 (p) + \u03c6(s),\nwith \u03c7 a monotone smooth function such that \u03c7(s) = 1 for s \u2264 0, and \u03c7(s) = 0 for s \u2265 1, while\n\u03c6(s) = 2s3 \u2212 3s2 + 1 has a non-degenerate maximum at 0 and a non-degenerate minimum at 1.\nThe function f is a non-degenerate Lyapunov function for a Morse vector field on R\u00d7 M satisfying\n(C1-4) and (PS), and the boundary operator in the associated Morse complex has the form (8).\nThis allows us to define \u03c6f0 f1 as the homomorphism induced by the chain homomorphism \u03c8.\nWe wish to emphasize that this functorial approach is possible thanks to the fact that the\nconditions (C1-4), and (PS) naturally pass from the functions f0 , f1 to the cone function f : in\nthis sense, these conditions were said to be convex.\nIn particular, two functions f0 and f1 such that c := kf1 \u2212f0 k\u221e is finite, have always isomorphic\nMorse homologies, as implied by the functoriality applied to the inequalities\nf0 \u2212 c \u2264 f1 \u2264 f0 + c,\n\nf1 \u2212 c \u2264 f0 \u2264 f1 + c.\n\nFor example, let f : M \u2212 \u00d7 M + \u2192 R be a Morse function satisfying (PS) and such that F =\n\u2212grad f /(1 + kgrad f k2 ) satisfies (C1-4) with respect to the subbundle V = T M \u2212 \u00d7 (0). If f has\nbounded distance from a function of the form (6), still satisfying the same assumptions, the Morse\nhomology of f is given by (7). More generally, if there exists c > 0 such that\n1 + +\n1\nf (p ) \u2212 cf \u2212 (p\u2212 ) \u2212 c \u2264 f (p\u2212 , p+ ) \u2264 cf + (p+ ) \u2212 f (p\u2212 ) + c,\nc\nc\nwe deduce the existence of a surjective homomorphism\nM\nHq+ (M + ) \u2297 Hq\u2212 (M \u2212 ),\nHq (f ) \u2192\n(q\u2212 ,q+ )\u2208N\nq+ \u2212q\u2212 =q\n\nwhich implies lower estimates on the number of critical points of f of a given relative Morse index.\n\n7\n\n\fContents\n1 Essential subbundles of a Hilbert bundle\n\n8\n\n2 Morse vector fields and subbundles\n\n13\n\n3 Finite dimension of Wu (x) \u2229 Ws (y)\n\n16\n\n4 Which manifolds can be obtained as Wu (x) \u2229 Ws (y)\n\n19\n\n5 Orientation of Wu (x) \u2229 Ws (y)\n\n22\n\n6 Compactness of Wu (x) \u2229 Ws (y)\n\n24\n\n7 Flow-invariant essentially vertical families\n\n29\n\n8 Broken flow lines\n\n36\n\n9 Intersections of dimension 1 and 2\n\n37\n\n10 The boundary homomorphism\n\n38\n\n11 Proof of the conjugacy theorem\n\n40\n\nA Appendix - Infinite dimensional Grassmannians\n\n48\n\nB Appendix - Linear ordinary differential operators in Hilbert spaces\n\n53\n\nC Appendix - Hyperbolic rest points\n\n56\n\n1\n\nEssential subbundles of a Hilbert bundle\n\nIn this section we will fix some basic facts about the Grassmannian of a Hilbert space and some\nrelated constructions. We refer to Appendix A for more details.\nHilbert Grassmannians. If E and F are Banach spaces, L(E, F ) will denote the space of\nbounded linear operators from E to F , while Lc (E, F ) will denote the subspace consisting of\ncompact operators. In the case F = E, we will simply write L(E) and Lc (E).\nLet H be an infinite dimensional separable real Hilbert space. The orthogonal projection onto\na closed linear subspace V \u2282 H will be denoted by PV , while the orthogonal complement of V\nwill be indicated by V \u22a5 . We will denote by Gr(H) the Grassmannian of H, that is the space of\nall closed linear subspaces of H, endowed with the operator norm topology. By Gr\u221e,\u221e (H) we\nwill denote the connected component of Gr(H) consisting of subspaces of infinite dimension and\ninfinite codimension. The other connected components of Gr(H) are the subsets Grn,\u221e (H), the\nset of linear subspaces of H of dimension n, and Gr\u221e,n (H), the set of linear subspaces of H of\ncodimension n.\nCompact perturbations and essential Grassmannians. Given V, W \u2208 Gr(H), we will say\nthat V is a compact perturbation of W if PV \u2212 PW is a compact operator. In this case, the relative\ndimension of V with respect to W is the integer\ndim(V, W ) = dim V \u2229 W \u22a5 \u2212 dim V \u22a5 \u2229 W.\nGiven m \u2208 N, the (m)-essential Grassmannian Gr(m) (H) is the quotient space of Gr(H) by the\nequivalence relation\n{(V, W ) \u2208 Gr(H) \u00d7 Gr(H) | V is a compact perturbation of W , and dim(V, W ) \u2208 mZ} .\n8\n\n\fBy Gr\u2217(m) (H) we will denote the quotient of Gr\u221e,\u221e (H) by the same equivalence relation. The\nspace Gr(1) (H) is called just the essential Grassmannian of H. If [W ] \u2208 Gr(m) (H) and V \u2208\nGr(H) is a compact perturbation of an element (hence every element) of the class [W ], then\ndim(V, [W ]) := dim(V, W ) is well-defined as an integer modulo m.\nEssential subbundles. Fix some k \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}. Let B be a topological space if k = 0, or a C k\nBanach manifold if k \u2265 1, and let H \u2192 B be an H-bundle on B, that is a C k fiber bundle with\nbase space B, total space H, typical fiber the Hilbert space H, and structure group GL(H). Since\nthe Hilbert space H is infinite dimensional, the group GL(H) is contractible (see [Kui65]), so the\nabove bundle is always trivial.\nWe can associate to the C k Hilbert bundle H \u2192 B the C k fiber bundles\n[\n[\nGr(H) =\nGr(Hb ) \u2192 B, Gr(m) (H) =\nGr(m) (Hb ) \u2192 B, m \u2208 N.\nb\u2208B\n\nb\u2208B\n\nThe spaces Gr(H) and Gr(m) (H) admit natural analytic structures, so the above bundles have C k\nstructures. A C k section of Gr(H) \u2192 B is just a C k subbundle of H \u2192 B. Similarly, a C k section\nof Gr(m) (H) \u2192 B will be called a C k (m)-essential subbundle of H \u2192 B, or just a C k essential\nsubbundle in the case m = 1.\nLifting properties. The following questions arise naturally: when is an (m)-essential subbundle, m \u2208 N, liftable to a true subbundle? when is an (m)-essential subbundle, m \u2265 1, liftable to\nan (hm)-essential subbundle, for h \u2208 N ? We shall discuss these questions in the nontrivial case\nof subbundles with infinite dimension and codimension.\nSince the Hilbert bundle H \u2192 B is trivial, the (m)-essential subbundle we wish to lift can be\nidentified with a map\nE : B \u2192 Gr\u2217(m) (H),\nand we are looking at the lifting problems\n\nGr\u2217(hm) (H)\nv;;\nv\nv\nv\n\u000f\u000f\nv E\n// Gr\u2217(m) (H)\nB\n\nGr\u221e,\u221e (H)\nv::\nv\nv\nv\nv E // \u2217 \u000f\u000f\nGr(m) (H)\nB\n\nIn the first diagram, the vertical map is a fibration from a contractible space, so the (m)-essential\nsubbundle E is liftable to a true subbundle if and only if the map E is null-homotopic. It can be\nproved that Gr\u2217(0) (H) is simply connected, while the fundamental group of Gr(m) (H) for m \u2265 1 is\ninfinite cyclic. Furthermore, \u03c0i (Gr(m) (H)) \u223c\n= \u03c0i\u22121 (BO(\u221e)) for i \u2265 2, where BO(\u221e) denotes the\nclassifying space of the infinite real orthogonal group. Hence, using Bott periodicity theorem, we\ndeduce that E is null homotopic if and only the homomorphism\nE\u2217 : \u03c0i (B) \u2192 \u03c0i (Gr\u2217(m) (H))\n\nvanishes for every i \u2261 1, 2, 3, 5 mod 8. In particular, every (m)-essential subbundle is liftable to\na true subbundle when \u03c0i (B) = 0 for every i \u2261 1, 2, 3, 5 mod 8.\nIn the second diagram, the vertical arrow is a covering map, and the image of the induced\nhomomorphism\n\u03c01 (Gr\u2217(hm) (H)) \u2192 \u03c01 (Gr\u2217(m) (H)) = Z\n\nis the subgroup hZ, so the (m)-essential subbundle E is liftable to a (hm)-essential subbundle if and\nonly if E\u2217 (\u03c01 (B)) \u2282 hZ. In particular, every (m)-essential subbundle is liftable to a (0)-essential\nsubbundle when B is simply connected.\nIn this paper, we will be mainly interested in subbundles and essential subbundles of the\ntangent bundle T M of a Hilbert manifold M (that is a paracompact manifold modeled on the\nHilbert space H). Notice that, since M is locally contractible, any (m)-essential subbundle E is\nlocally liftable to a true subbundle, which will be called a local representative of E.\n9\n\n\fIntegrable essential subbundles of T M . An essential subbundle E of T M is called integrable\nif M admits an atlas whose charts \u03c6 : dom (\u03c6) \u2282 M \u2192 H map E into the essential subbundle\nrepresented by a constant closed linear subspace V \u2282 H:\n\u2200p \u2208 dom (\u03c6) D\u03c6(p)E(p) = [V ].\n\n(1.1)\n\nIf \u03c6 and \u03c8 are two such charts, the transition map \u03c4 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u22121 : dom (\u03c4 ) \u2282 H \u2192 H satisfies\nD\u03c4 (\u03be)V is a compact perturbation of V\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 dom (\u03c4 ).\n\nBy Proposition A.4, the above fact is equivalent to\nQD\u03c4 (\u03be)(I \u2212 Q) is a compact operator \u2200\u03be \u2208 dom (\u03c4 ),\n\n(1.2)\n\nQ being a projector with kernel V . An atlas A of M satisfying (1.1) and (1.2) form an integrable\nstructure modeled on (H, V ) for the essential subbundle E.\nConversely, an atlas of M whose transition maps satisfy (1.2) defines an integrable essential\nsubbundle of T M . Such an essential subbundle is liftable to an (m)-essential subbundle m \u2208 N, if\nand only if\ndim(D\u03c4 (\u03be)V, V ) \u2261 0\nmod m\nfor every transition map \u03c4 and every \u03be \u2208 dom (\u03c4 ).\nConsidering integrable essential subbundles will be important starting from section 6. Actually,\nwe will be interested in the following stronger version of integrability.\n1.1 Definition. Let V be a closed linear subspace of the Hilbert space H, and let Q \u2208 L(H)\nbe a projector with kernel V . A strong integrable structure modeled on (H, V ) for the essential\nsubbundle E of T M is atlas A of M such that:\n(i) for every \u03c6 \u2208 A and every p \u2208 dom (\u03c6), D\u03c6(p)E(p) = [V ];\n(ii) for every \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 A the transition map \u03c4 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u22121 : dom (\u03c4 ) \u2282 H \u2192 H satisfies\nQA is pre-compact if and only if Q\u03c4 (A) is pre-compact,\nfor every bounded A \u2282 dom (\u03c4 ).\nSince the set QA is pre-compact if and only if the projection of A into the quotient space H/V\nis pre-compact, the above definition does not depend on the choice of the projector Q, but only\non the subspace V .\nLet \u03c4 be a transition map satisfying condition (ii) of the above definition, and let \u03be \u2208 dom (\u03c4 ).\nThen the restriction of the map Q\u03c4 to the set dom (\u03c4 ) \u2229 (\u03be + V ) is a compact map (i.e. it\nmaps bounded sets into pre-compact sets). Therefore its differential at \u03be, namely the linear\noperator QD\u03c4 (\u03be)|V is compact, implying (1.2). Hence a strong integrable structure is also an\nintegrable structure. The notion of a strong integrable structure is strictly more restrictive, because\na nonlinear map whose differential at every point is compact need not be compact.\n1.2 Remark. Assume that W is a compact perturbation of the closed linear subspace V . Notice\nthat if A \u2282 H\nPW \u22a5 A \u2282 PV \u22a5 A + (PV \u2212 PW )A.\nThen if A is bounded PV \u22a5 A is pre-compact if and only if PW \u22a5 A is pre-compact. Therefore a strong\nintegrable structure modeled on (H, V ) is also a strong integrable structure modeled on (H, W ).\n\n10\n\n\fPresentations of an essential subbundle. A natural way to construct an integrable subbundle of T M is to consider the kernel of a submersion, or of a family of submersions with matching\nkernels. We wish to describe the essential version of this construction.\nThe following lemma can be considered the essential version of the fact that in suitable charts\na submersion is a linear projection.\n1.3 Lemma. Let M and N be manifolds modeled on the Hilbert spaces H and E, respectively. Let\nQ : M \u2192 N be a C k , k \u2265 1, semi-Fredholm map with constant non-negative index. Then there\nexists a projector Q \u2208 L(H) such that, denoting by V its kernel, there holds: for every p \u2208 M\nthere exists a C k chart \u03c6 : U \u2192 H, p \u2208 U \u2282 M , such that\n(i) \u03c6(U ) is bounded;\n(ii) for every \u03be \u2208 \u03c6(U ), ker D(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be) is a compact perturbation of V , with\ndim(ker D(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be), V ) = dim coker DQ(\u03c6\u22121 (\u03be));\n(iii) for every A \u2282 \u03c6(U ), Q(\u03c6\u22121 (A)) is pre-compact if and only if QA is compact.\nIn most applications, the index of Q will be +\u221e.\nProof. The matter being local, we may assume that M is an open subset of the Hilbert space\nH, that p = 0, that N is an open subset of the Hilbert space E, and that Q(0) = 0. Since\nind DQ(0) \u2265 0, there is T \u2208 L(H, E) with finite rank such that DQ(0) + T is surjective. By\nthe open mapping theorem, DQ(0) + T has a linear bounded right inverse R \u2208 L(E, H). Let\nQ := R(DQ(0) + T ) \u2208 L(H) be the associated linear projection, and set V := ker Q. Since the\nindex of Q is constant (i.e. it does not take different values on different connected components of\nM ), by applying a linear conjugacy the same Q and V can be used for every point p \u2208 M .\nThe map R(Q + T ) : M \u2192 ran Q is a local submersion at 0, with differential at 0 equal to Q.\nTherefore, there exists a neighborhood U \u2282 M of 0 and a C k diffeomorphism \u03c6 : U \u2192 H such\nthat \u03c6(0) = 0, D\u03c6(0) = I, \u03c6(U ) and Q(U ) bounded (so that (i) holds), and\nR(Q + T ) \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 (\u03be) = Q\u03be,\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 \u03c6(U ).\n\n(1.3)\n\nDifferentiating we get RD(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be) + RT D\u03c6\u22121 (\u03be) = Q. Since R is injective and since T has\nfinite rank, Proposition A.3 implies that\nker D(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be) = ker RD(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be)\nis a compact perturbation of ker Q = V , and\ndim(ker D(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be), V ) = \u2212 dim(ran RD(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be), ran Q)\n= \u2212 dim(ran D(Q \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 )(\u03be), E) = dim coker DQ(\u03c6\u22121 (\u03be))D\u03c6\u22121 (\u03be) = dim coker DQ(\u03c6\u22121 (\u03be)),\nproving (ii). By (1.3), for every A \u2282 \u03c6(U ),\nQA \u2282 RQ(\u03c6\u22121 (A)) + ran RT,\n\nQ(\u03c6\u22121 (A)) \u2282 (DQ(0) + T )QA + ran T,\n\nso claim (iii) follows from the fact that \u03c6(U ) and Q(U ) are bounded, and from the fact that T\nhas finite rank.\n1.4 Proposition. Consider an open covering {Mi }i\u2208I of M , a family of infinite dimensional\nHilbert manifolds {Ni }i\u2208I modeled on E, and a family of semi-Fredholm C k , k \u2265 1, maps Qi :\nMi \u2192 Ni with the same constant non-negative index, such that for any i, j \u2208 I and for any\nA \u2282 Mi \u2229 Mj ,\nQi (A) is pre-compact if and only if Qj (A) is pre-compact.\n11\n\n(1.4)\n\n\fThen the family {ker DQi (p) | p \u2208 Mi }, i \u2208 I, defines a C k\u22121 essential subbundle E of T M . The\natlas A consisting of all the charts \u03c6 of M satisfying properties (i), (ii), and (iii) of Lemma 1.3\napplied to all the maps Qi is a strong integrable structure modeled on (H, V ) for E. This atlas is\nsuch that for every \u03c6 \u2208 A and every A \u2282 dom (\u03c6) \u2282 Mi ,\nQ\u03c6(A) is pre-compact if and only if Qi (A) is pre-compact.\n\n(1.5)\n\nMoreover, for every p \u2208 Mi \u2229 Mj the operator DQi (p) DQj (p)\u2217 \u2208 L(TQj (p) Nj , TQi (p) Ni ) is Fredholm, and E is liftable to an (m)-essential subbundle, m \u2208 N, if and only if\nind (DQi (p) DQj (p)\u2217 ) \u2261 0 mod m,\n\n\u2200i, j \u2208 I, \u2200p \u2208 Mi \u2229 Mj .\n\nProof. Let us prove that for any p \u2208 Mi \u2229 Mj the subspace ker DQi (p) is a compact perturbation\nof ker DQj (p). Since DQi (p) has finite corank, we can find a C 1 embedded finite dimensional open\ndisk D \u2282 Ni with D compact, such that Qi (p) \u2208 D and the map Qi is transverse to D. Then\n1\nQ\u22121\ni (D) is a C submanifold of M , and by our assumption the map Qj |Q\u22121 (D)\u2229Mj is compact.\ni\n\nTherefore its differential, namely the restriction of DQj to the subspace Tp Q\u22121\ni (D) \u2283 ker DQi (p)\nis compact. In particular, the restriction of DQj (p) to ker DQi (p) is compact, and similarly the\nrestriction of DQi (p) to ker DQj (p) is compact. Hence Proposition A.5 implies that ker DQi (p)\nis a compact perturbation of ker DQj (p), as we wished to prove, and that\n\nind (DQi (p) DQj (p)\u2217 ) = dim coker DQj (p) \u2212 dim coker DQi (p) + dim(ker DQi (p), ker DQj (p)).\n(1.6)\nNow let \u03c6 and \u03c8, dom (\u03c6) \u2282 Mi , dom (\u03c8) \u2282 Mj , be two charts satisfying conditions (i), (ii), and\n(iii) of Lemma 1.3 applied to Qi and Qj , respectively (possibly i = j). Let \u03c4 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u22121 be the\ntransition map. If A \u2282 dom (\u03c4 ) = \u03c8(dom (\u03c6) \u2229 dom (\u03c8)), by Lemma 1.3.(iii) QA is pre-compact\nif and only if Qj (\u03c8 \u22121 (A)) is pre-compact, by (1.4) if and only if Qi (\u03c8 \u22121 (A)) = Qi (\u03c6\u22121 (\u03c4 (A)))\nis pre-compact, and again by Lemma 1.3.(iii) if and only if Q\u03c4 (A) is pre-compact. This proves\ncondition (ii) of Definition 1.1, and proves that the atlas A satisfies (1.5).\nFinally, let p \u2208 Mi . By Lemma 1.3.(ii), there is a neighborhood Up of p and a C k submersion\ne\nQp := Q\u03c6 : Up \u2192 ran Q into a Hilbert space such that for any q \u2208 Up , ker DQi (q) is a compact\nep (q), and\nperturbation of ker DQ\nep (q)) = dim coker DQi (q).\ndim(ker DQi (q), ker DQ\n\n(1.7)\n\nThen the family {ker DQi | i \u2208 I} defines the same C k\u22121 essential subbundle of T M as the one\ndefined by the family\nn\no\nep | p \u2208 M .\nker DQ\n(1.8)\nIf q \u2208 Up \u2229 Up\u2032 \u2229 Mi \u2229 Mj , by (1.6) and (1.7) we obtain (see formula (A.2))\n\nep (q), ker DQi (q)) + dim(ker DQi (q), ker DQj (q))\nep (q), ker Q\nep\u2032 (q)) = dim(ker DQ\ndim(ker DQ\nep\u2032 (q)) = ind (DQi (q) DQj (q)\u2217 ),\n+ dim(ker DQj (q), ker DQ\n\nso (1.8) defines an (m)-essential subbundle of T M if and only if\nind (DQi (q) DQj (q)\u2217 ) \u2261 0 mod m,\n\n\u2200i, j \u2208 I, \u2200q \u2208 Mi \u2229 Mj .\n\nThe above proposition suggests the following:\n1.5 Definition. A strong presentation of the essential subbundle E of T M consists of an open\ncovering {Mi }i\u2208I of M , a family of manifolds Ni , i \u2208 I, modeled on the Hilbert space E, a family\nof semi-Fredholm C 1 maps Qi : Mi \u2192 Ni with the same constant non-negative index such that:\n(i) for every i \u2208 I and every p \u2208 Mi , the kernel of DQi (p) belongs to the essential class E(p);\n12\n\n\f(ii) for every i, j \u2208 I and every A \u2282 Mi \u2229 Mj , Qi (A) is pre-compact if and only if Qj (A) is\npre-compact.\nProposition 1.4 states among other facts that a strong presentation of E determines a strong\nintegrable structure for E.\n\n2\n\nMorse vector fields and subbundles\n\nDefinitions and basic facts. Let M be a paracompact manifold of class C 2 , modelled on the\ninfinite dimensional separable real Hilbert space H. Let F be a tangent vector field of class C 1\non M . This field determines a local flow on M ,\n\u03c6 \u2208 C 1 (\u03a9(F ), M ),\n\n\u2202t \u03c6(t, p) = F (\u03c6(t, p)),\n\n\u03c6(0, p) = p,\n\nwhere \u03a9(F ) \u2282 R \u00d7 M is the maximal set of existence for the solutions of this ordinary differential\nequation. We will also use the notation \u03c6t (p) = \u03c6(t, p).\nA rest point of F is a point x \u2208 M such that F (x) = 0. The set of rest points of F is denoted\nby rest (F ). If x \u2208 rest (F ), the Jacobian of F at x, \u2207F (x), is the bounded linear operator on\nTx M defined as\n\u2207F (x)\u03be = LX F (x),\n\nfor X a tangent vector field such that X(x) = \u03be \u2208 Tx M ,\n\nwhere LX F denotes the Lie derivative of F along X. Indeed, the fact that F (x) = 0 implies that\nLX F (x) depends only on the value of X at x.\nWe recall that an operator L \u2208 L(H) is said hyperbolic if \u03c3(L) \u2229 iR = \u2205. In this case, the\ndecomposition of the spectrum of L into the subset with positive real part and the one with\nnegative real part determines an L-invariant splitting H = V + (L) \u2295 V \u2212 (L). A point x \u2208 rest (F )\nis said hyperbolic if the operator \u2207F (x) is hyperbolic. In this case, the linear unstable space Hxu\nand the linear stable space Hxs , are defined as\nHxu := V + (\u2207F (x)),\n\nHxs := V \u2212 (\u2207F (x)).\n\nA vector field F all of whose rest points are hyperbolic is said a Morse vector field.\nA Lyapunov function for the vector field F is a function f \u2208 C 1 (M ) such that\nDf (p)[F (p)] < 0,\n\n\u2200p \u2208 M \\ rest (F ).\n\n(2.1)\n\nIn particular, t 7\u2192 f (\u03c6(t, p)) is strictly decreasing if p \u2208\n/ rest (F ). Note that every critical point of\nf must be a rest point of F . If x is a hyperbolic rest point for F , then it is a critical point of f ,\nas it easily follows from a first order expansion of F at x.\nIf the vector field F is Morse, we shall ask the Lyapunov function to be non-degenerate: f is\ntwice differentiable at every rest point x and, denoting by D2 f (x) the second differential of f at\nx, seen as a symmetric bounded bilinear form, we have that \u03be 7\u2192 D2 f (x)[\u03be, \u03be] is coercive on Hxs ,\nwhile \u03be 7\u2192 \u2212D2 f (x)[\u03be, \u03be] is coercive on Hxu . The Morse vector field F is said gradient-like if it has\na non-degenerate Lyapunov function.\nThe relative Morse index. For V a subbundle of T M of class C 1 , consider the following\ncompatibility condition between F and V:\n(C1) for every x rest point of F , the linear unstable space Hxu is a compact perturbation of V(x).\nIf (C1) holds, the relative Morse index of x \u2208 rest (F ) is the integer\nm(x, V) := dim(Hxu , V(x)),\nand the sets\nrestq (F ) := {x \u2208 rest (F ) | m(x, V) = q} ,\n13\n\nq \u2208 Z,\n\n\fconstitute a partition of rest (F ).\nCondition (C1) clearly depends only on the essential class of V. Therefore it makes sense to\ntalk about vector fields which satisfy (C1) with respect to an essential subbundle. More precisely,\nthe C 1 Morse vector field F satisfies (C1) with respect to the essential subbundle E if for every\nrest point x of F the unstable space Hxu belongs to the essential class E(x). In this more general\nsituation, there is no relative Morse index. However, if the essential subbundle E comes from an\n(m)-essential subbundle - still denoted by E - then the relative Morse index of x \u2208 rest (F ) is an\ninteger modulo m - denoted by m(x, E). In particular, if E is a (0)-essential subbundle, the relative\nMorse index is still integer valued.\nEssentially invariant subbundles. We shall say that the C 1 subbundle V is invariant with\nrespect to F at p \u2208 M if\n(LF P)(p)P(p) = 0,\n(2.2)\n\nwhere P is a projector onto V of T M : P is a C 1 section of the Banach bundle of linear endomorphisms of T M such that for every p \u2208 M , P(p) \u2208 L(Tp M ) is a projector onto V(p). This notion\ndoes not depend on the choice of the projector P, but only on the subbundle V. Indeed, if P and\nQ are two projectors onto V, we have the identity\n(LF Q)Q = (I \u2212 Q)(LF P)PQ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich can be verified by taking the Lie derivative of the identities PQ = Q = Q2 . This definition\nis motivated by the well known fact that (2.2) holds for any p \u2208 M if and only if the subbundle\nV is invariant under the action of the local flow \u03c6, that is D\u03c6t (p)V(p) = V(\u03c6t (p)) for every\n(t, p) \u2208 \u03a9(F ).\nSimilarly, we shall say that V is essentially invariant with respect to F at p if (LF P)(p)P(p)\nis a compact endomorphism of Tp M . Again, (2.3) shows that this notion depends only on V.\nBy Proposition A.4, V is essentially invariant with respect to F at every p \u2208 M if and only if\nD\u03c6t (p)V(p) is a compact perturbation of V(\u03c6t (p)), for every (t, p) \u2208 \u03a9(F ). The second compatibility condition between F and V is:\n(C2) V is essentially invariant with respect to F at any point p \u2208 M .\nAlso this condition can be stated for an essential subbundle. Indeed, an essential subbundle\nE of T M will be said invariant with respect to F at p if a local representative of E at p is\nessentially invariant with respect to F at p. This notion does not depend on the choice of the local\nrepresentative of E at p: if V and W are two such local representatives on some neighborhood U of\np, and P, Q are the orthogonal projectors onto V, W, with respect to some Riemannian structure\non M , we have that P(q) \u2212 Q(q) \u2208 Lc (Tq M ) for any q \u2208 U , so (LF (P \u2212 Q))(p) \u2208 Lc (Tp M ), and\nthe identity\n(LF P)P \u2212 (LF Q)Q = (LF P)(P \u2212 Q) + (LF (P \u2212 Q))Q,\n\nshows that (LF P)P is compact if and only if (LF Q)Q is compact. Hence, we shall say that the C 1\nvector field F satisfies (C2) with respect to the C 1 essential subbundle E of T M if E is invariant\nwith respect to F at every p \u2208 M .\n2.1 Proposition. Let E be a C 1 essential subbundle of T M . Then the set of C 1 vector fields on\nM which satisfy (C2) with respect to E is a C 1 (M )-module.\n\nProof. Everything follows from the formulas\n(LX+Y P)P = (LX P)P + (LY P)P,\n\n(LhX P)P\u03be = h(LX P)P\u03be + Dh[P\u03be](P \u2212 I)X,\n\nwhere h \u2208 C 1 (M ).\n\n14\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 T M,\n\n\fExamples. We conclude this section with some simple examples.\n2.2 Example. (Vector fields whose rest points have finite Morse index or finite Morse co-index)\nConsider the classical situation of a Morse vector field F all of whose rest points have finite Morse\nindex. Then (C1) and (C2) hold with respect to the trivial subbundle V = (0). With such a V\nindeed, (C2) is fulfilled by any vector field, while (C1) is equivalent to asking the unstable space\nof every rest point to be finite dimensional. In this case, m(x, (0)) is the usual Morse index of the\nrest point x.\nSimilarly, a Morse vector field all of whose rest points have finite Morse co-index satisfies (C1)\nand (C2) with respect to the trivial subbundle V = T M , and \u2212m(x, T M ) is the co-index of the\nrest point x.\n2.3 Example. (Perturbations of a non-degenerate quadratic form) Assume that M = H is a\nHilbert space, and consider a function of the form\nf (\u03be) =\n\n1\nhL\u03be, \u03bei + b(\u03be),\n2\n\nwhere L \u2208 L(H) is self-adjoint invertible, and b \u2208 C 2 (H). Let F be the (negative) gradient vector\nfield of f ,\nF (\u03be) = \u2212grad f (\u03be) = \u2212L\u03be \u2212 grad b(\u03be),\nand consider the constant subbundle V = V \u2212 (L). In this case, condition (C2) means asking that\n(Lgrad f PV )(\u03be)PV = [PV , Hess f (\u03be)]PV = [PV , Hess b(\u03be)]PV\nshould be compact for every \u03be \u2208 H. In particular, if we assume that the Hessian of b at every\npoint is compact, condition (C2) holds. Since the negative eigenspace of a compact perturbation of\nL is a compact perturbation of V (Proposition B.1), also condition (C1) holds.\n2.4 Example. (Product manifolds) Assume that M = M \u2212 \u00d7 M + is the product of two Hilbert\nmanifolds, and consider the subbundle V = T M \u2212 \u00d7 (0) of T M . Fix some Riemannian structure\non M \u2212 and on M + , and consider the product Riemannian structure on M . Let F = \u2212grad f be\nthe negative gradient of a Morse function on M . Then F satisfies (C1) with respect to V if and\nonly if for every critical point x the Hessian of f at x decomposes as Hess f (x) = Lx + Kx , where\nLx is self-adjoint, invertible, and V \u2212 (Lx ) = V(x), while Kx is a compact endomorphism of Tx M .\nMoreover, F satisfies (C2) with respect to V if and only if for every p \u2208 M the operator\n(LF P)(p)P(p) = (\u2207grad f P(p) + [P(p), Hess f (p)])P(p)\nis compact, where P denotes the orthogonal projection onto V.\n2.5 Example. (Semi-Riemannian geodesics [AM04a]) Let Q be an n-dimensional manifold, endowed with a semi-Riemannian structure h, that is a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form on\nT Q. Denote by (n+ , n\u2212 ) the signature of h, n+ + n\u2212 = n. The semi-Riemannian structure h\ninduces a Levi-Civita covariant derivation \u2207, and the geodesics - i.e. the 1-periodic solutions q of\nthe second order ODE \u2207q\u0307 q\u0307 = 0 - joining two fixed points q0 , q1 \u2208 Q are the critical points of the\nenergy functional\nZ\n1 1\nf (q) =\nh(q\u0307(t), q\u0307(t)) dt,\n2 0\n\b\non the Hilbert manifold M := q \u2208 W 1,2 ([0, 1], Q) | q(0) = q0 , q(1) = q1 consisting of paths in Q\nof Sobolev class W 1,2 joining q0 and q1 . When n+ 6= 0 and n\u2212 6= 0, all the critical points of f have\ninfinite Morse index and co-index. Assume that T Q has an integrable subbundle V of dimension\nn\u2212 such that h is strictly negative on V , and set\nV(q) = {\u03b6 \u2208 Tq M = q \u2217 (T Q) | \u03b6(t) \u2208 V (q(t)) \u2200t \u2208 [0, 1]} ,\n\n15\n\n\u2200q \u2208 M.\n\n\fThe integrability of V is reflected into the integrability of V, and this fact can be used to build a class\nof Riemannian structures on M - equivalent to the standard W 1,2 metric - such that grad f satisfies\n(C1) and (C2) with respect to V. In this situation, it can also be proved that the relative Morse\nindex m(q, V) of the geodesic q coincides with the Maslov index of a suitable path of Lagrangian\nsubspaces, obtained by looking at the Hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle of Q generated\nby the Legendre transform H : T \u2217 Q \u2192 R of the Lagrangian L : T Q \u2192 R, L(\u03b6) = 1/2 h(\u03b6, \u03b6).\n\n3\n\nFinite dimension of Wu (x) \u2229 Ws(y)\n\nStable and unstable manifolds.

Starting from section 6 however, we will\nrestrict our attention to gradient-like vector fields, for which W u (x) and W s (x) are embedded\nsubmanifolds (see also Appendix C).\n3.1 Proposition. Let E be an essential subbundle of T M , and let x be a hyperbolic rest point of\nthe C 1 vector field F on M . Then the following facts are equivalent:\n(i) Hxu belongs to the essential class E(x), and E is invariant with respect to F at every p \u2208\nW u (x);\n(ii) the tangent space Tp W u (x) belongs to the essential class E(p) for every p \u2208 W u (x).\nIf either (i) or (ii) holds, and if E is liftable to an (m)-essential subbundle - still denoted by E then we have the identity between integers modulo m\ndim(Tp W u (x), E(p)) = m(x, E),\n\n\u2200p \u2208 W u (x).\n\nProof. Let p \u2208 W u (x) and define u : [\u2212\u221e, 0] \u2192 M by u(t) := \u03c6t (p) for t > \u2212\u221e, and u(\u2212\u221e) = x.\nIf \u03c8 : U \u2192 H, x \u2208 U , is a local chart mapping the open set U diffeomorphically into the\n\u22121\nHilbert space H, then for T large \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2212T : \u03c6\u2212T\n(U ) \u2192 H is a local chart whose domain contains\nu([\u2212\u221e, 0]). Therefore, since both the assertions of the theorem are invariant with respect to\ndifferentiable conjugacy, we may assume that M is an open subset of H. The set \u03c6([\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 {p})\nhas a contractible neighborhood U , and we can find a C 1 map P : U \u2192 L(H) such that P(\u03be) is a\nprojector onto a subspace in the essential class E(\u03be), for every \u03be \u2208 U .\nSet P := P(x), and let R : [\u2212\u221e, 0] \u2192 GL(H) be such that R(t)P = P(u(t))R(t), R(\u2212\u221e) = I,\nand R\u2032 (t) \u2192 0 for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Set\nX(t) := R(t)\u22121 D\u03c6t (p)R(0).\nThen X solves X \u2032 = AX, X(0) = I, where\nA(t) = R(t)\u22121 R\u2032 (t) + R(t)\u22121 DF (u(t))R(t) \u2208 L(H)\nconverges to the hyperbolic operator A(\u2212\u221e) = DF (x) for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Let\n\u001a\n\u001b\nWAu := \u03be \u2208 H | lim X(t)\u03be = 0 ,\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n16\n\n\fbe the linear unstable space of the path of operators A (see Appendix B). Then\nTu(t) W u (x) = R(t)X(t)WAu ,\n\nTx W u (x) = V + (A(\u2212\u221e)).\n\n(3.1)\n\nDifferentiating R(t)P = P(u(t))R(t) we obtain the identity\nR\u2032 (t)P = DP(u(t))[F (u(t))]R(t) + P(u(t))R\u2032 (t),\nfrom which an easy computation gives\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[A(t), P ]P = R(t)\u22121 DP(u(t))[F (u(t))] + [P(u(t)), DF (u(t))] P(u(t))R(t).\n\nSo by the usual expression for the Lie derivative,\n\n[A(t), P ]P = R(t)\u22121 (LF P)(u(t))P(u(t))R(t),\n\n(3.2)\n\nand the equivalence of (i) and (ii) follows form (3.1), (3.2), and Proposition B.3.\nAssume now that E comes from an (m)-essential subbundle. Since W u (x) is connected and the\nrelative dimension is a continuous function, for every p \u2208 W u (x) we have the following identity\nbetween integers modulo m\ndim(Tp W u (x), E(p)) = dim(Tx W u (x), E(x)) = dim(Hxu , E(x)) = m(x, E).\nRecall that a pair of closed subspaces (V, W ) of the Hilbert space H is said a Fredholm pair if\nV \u2229 W has finite dimension and V + W has finite codimension, in which case we define the index\nof (V, W ) to be\nind (V, W ) = dim V \u2229 W \u2212 codim(V + W ).\nThe space of Fredholm pairs of H, denoted by Fp(H), is an open subspace of Gr(H) \u00d7 Gr(H),\nand the index is a continuous function. If H \u2192 B is a C k Hilbert bundle, there is an associated\nC k bundle\n[\nFp(Hb ) \u2192 B.\nFp(H) =\nb\u2208B\n\nThe above proposition has the following corollary.\n\n3.2 Corollary. Assume that the Morse vector field F satisfies (C1-2) with respect to a subbundle\nV of T M . Then for every rest point x:\n(i) for any p \u2208 W u (x), Tp W u (x) is a compact perturbation of V(p), and dim(Tp W u (x), V(p)) =\nm(x, V);\n(ii) for any p \u2208 W s (x), (Tp W s (x), V(p)) is a Fredholm pair of index \u2212m(x, V).\nProof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from Proposition 3.1 and from the continuity of the\nrelative dimension. By (C1) and Proposition A.2, (Tx W s (x), V(x)) = (Hxs , V(x)) is a Fredholm\npair of index\nind (Tx W s (x), V(x)) = ind (Hxs , Hxu ) + dim(V(x), Hxu ) = \u2212m(x, V).\nTherefore, (Tp W s (x), V(p)) is a Fredholm pair of the same index for any p in a neighborhood U\nof x in the intrinsic topology of the immersed submanifold W s (x). The backward evolution of U\nby \u03c6 is the whole W s (x), so assertion (ii) follows from the fact that the tangent bundle of W s (x)\nis invariant, and V is essentially invariant under the action of \u03c6.\n\n17\n\n\fIntersections. Recall that two immersed submanifolds N, O \u2282 M have a transverse intersection\nif for every p \u2208 N \u2229 O there holds Tp N + Tp O = Tp M . In this case, N \u2229 O is an immersed\nsubmanifold of M , and Tp (N \u2229O) = Tp N \u2229Tp O. Similarly, N, O \u2282 M have a Fredholm intersection\nif for every p \u2208 N \u2229 O, (Tp N, Tp O) is a Fredholm pair of subspaces of Tp M . We are now ready to\nstate the result about the dimension of the intersection of the unstable and the stable manifolds.\n3.3 Theorem. Let k \u2208 N, let E be a (k)-essential subbundle of T M , and assume that the Morse\nvector field F satisfies (C1-2) with respect to E. Let x, y be two rest points of F . Then W u (x) and\nW s (y) have Fredholm intersection, with the number\nind (Tp W u (x), Tp W s (y)),\n\np \u2208 W u (x) \u2229 W s (y),\n\ndepending only on the homotopy class of the curve t 7\u2192 \u03c6(t, p) in the space of continuous paths\nu : R \u2192 M such that u(\u2212\u221e) = x, u(+\u221e) = y. Furthermore\nind (Tp W u (x), Tp W s (y)) \u2261 m(x, E) \u2212 m(y, E)\n\nmod k,\n\n(3.3)\n\nfor every p \u2208 W u (x) \u2229 W s (y).\nIn particular, if W u (x) and W s (y) have non-empty transverse intersection, then W u (x)\u2229W s (y)\nis an immersed finite dimensional submanifold of M , and the dimension of the component Wp of\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y) containing p depends only on the homotopy class of the curve t 7\u2192 \u03c6(t, p), and\ndim Wp \u2261 m(x, E) \u2212 m(y, E)\n\nmod k.\n\nIn particular, when F satisfies (C1-2) with respect to a (0)-essential subbundle E, then all the\ncomponents of the transverse intersection W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) have the same dimension m(x, E) \u2212\nm(y, E).\nProof. Let us fix two points p0 , p1 \u2208 W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) such that their orbits are homotopic in the\nspace of paths u : R \u2192 M with u(\u2212\u221e) = x, u(+\u221e) = y. In other words, there exists a continuous\nmap\nh : R \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 M,\nsuch that h(\u2212\u221e, s) = x, h(+\u221e, s) = y, h(t, i) = \u03c6(t, pi ), for i = 0, 1.\nThe map R \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 Gr(k) (T M ), (t, s) 7\u2192 E(h(t, x)), is liftable to a map W : R \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192\nGr(T M ) such that W(\u2212\u221e, *) and W(+\u221e, *) are constant maps. By Proposition 3.1, Th(t,s) W u (x)\nis a compact perturbation of W(t, s) and dim(Th(t,s) W u (x), W(t, s)) = dim(Hxu , W(\u2212\u221e, *)), for\nany t < +\u221e. Using an argument analogous to the proof of Corollary 3.2 (ii), it is easy to see that\n(Th(t,s) W s (y), W(t, s)) is a Fredholm pair of index \u2212 dim(Hyu , W(+\u221e, *)), for any t > \u2212\u221e. Then\nby Proposition A.2, (Th(t,s) W s (y), Th(t,s) W u (x)) is a Fredholm pair of index dim(Hxu , W(\u2212\u221e, *))\u2212\ndim(Hyu , W(+\u221e, *)). In particular, (Tp0 W s (y), Tp0 W u (x)) and (Tp1 W s (y), Tp1 W u (x)) are Fredholm pairs of the same index\nind (Tp0 W s (y), Tp0 W u (x)) = ind (Tp1 W s (y), Tp1 W u (x))\n= dim(Hxu , W(\u2212\u221e, *)) \u2212 dim(Hyu , W(+\u221e, *)),\nand the above formula implies (3.3). Finally, the statements which assume transversality follow\nfrom the fact that, under such an assumption,\nind (Tp W u (x), Tp W s (y)) = dim Tp W u (x) \u2229 Tp W s (y).\n3.4 Remark. We wish to remark that (C1-2) are asymmetric conditions: if F satisfies (C1-2)\nwith respect to a subbundle V, there need not exist a subbundle W such that \u2212F satisfies (C1-2)\nwith respect to W. Such an asymmetry is reflected into Corollary 3.2, which states that T W u (x)\nis a compact perturbation of V - a closed condition - while T W s (x) is in Fredholm pair with V 18\n\n\fan open condition. If we symmetrize (C1-2) we obtain the following stronger assumptions: if P is\na projector on T M , with image V and kernel W, there holds (C1'): Hxu is a compact perturbation\nof V(x), Hxs is a compact perturbation of W(x) for every x \u2208 rest (F ), and (C2'): (LF P)(p) is\ncompact for any p \u2208 M . This setting - actually its essential version - is closer to the setting of a\npolarized manifold (see [CJS95]).\n\n4\n\nWhich manifolds can be obtained as Wu (x) \u2229 Ws (y)\n\nArbitrary gradient-like vector fields. Let F be a gradient-like Morse-Smale vector field on\nthe Hilbert manifold M , with Lyapunov function f . If x, y \u2208 rest (F ) and f (y) < c < f (x), the\nset Z = W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) \u2229 f \u22121 ({c}) is a submanifold (non necessarily closed), being the transverse\nintersection in f \u22121 ({c}) of the submanifolds W u (x) \u2229 f \u22121 ({c}) and W s (y) \u2229 f \u22121 ({c}), and \u03c6\nsubordinates a diffeomorphism from R \u00d7 Z onto W u (x) \u2229 W s (y).\nWhen M is finite dimensional, there are limitations on the topological type of Z, e.g. if M\nis compact and there are no rest points z with f (y) < f (z) < f (x), then Z is the transverse\nintersection in f \u22121 ({c}) of two spheres. When M is infinite dimensional, and the rest points x, y\nhave infinite Morse index and co-index, there are no limitations at all on the topological type of Z,\nthe reason being that any manifold can be obtained as the transverse intersection of two infinite\ndimensional spheres.\nMore precisely, for any Hilbert manifold Z (finite dimensional or not) there is a gradient\nlike Morse vector field F on the Hilbert space H, with a non-degenerate Lyapunov function f ,\nhaving exactly two rest points x, y with f (y) < 0 < f (x), such that W u (x) \u2229 f \u22121 ({0}) and\nW s (y) \u2229 f \u22121 ({0}) are infinite dimensional spheres intersecting transversally in f \u22121 ({0}) at a\nclosed submanifold diffeomorphic to Z. Notice that in this case, the closure of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is\n(W u (x) \u2229 W s (y)) \u222a {x, y}, which is homeomorphic to the suspension of Z.\nThe construction relies on the following lemma.\n4.1 Lemma. Let Z be a closed infinite codimensional submanifold of a Hilbert manifold M . Then\nthere exists a smooth map \u03c6 : M \u2192 H such that 0 is a regular value and Z = \u03c6\u22121 ({0}).\nProof. A suitable tubular neighborhood U of Z is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of Z. Since Z\nhas infinite codimension, such a bundle is trivial. Therefore, there exists a submersion \u03c8 : U \u2192 H\nsuch that \u03c8 \u22121 ({0}) = Z. Since H \\ B, B denoting the open unit ball of H, is diffeomorphic to H\n(see [Bes66]), it is easy to define a smooth map \u03c6 : M \u2192 H which agrees with \u03c8 on a neighborhood\nU \u2032 \u2282 U of Z and such that \u03c6(M \\ U \u2032 ) \u2282 H \\ B, so that \u03c6\u22121 ({0}) = Z.\nLet F0 be the vector field on H \u00d7 H\nF0 (\u03be, \u03b7) = (\u03be, \u2212\u03c7(k\u03bek)\u03b7),\nwhere \u03c7 \u2208 C \u221e (R) is decreasing, \u03c7(s) = 1 for s \u2264 1/3 and \u03c7(s) = 0 for s \u2265 2/3. The vector field\nF0 has a unique rest point o = (0, 0), with W u (o) = H \u00d7 {0}, and has a non-degenerate Lyapunov\nfunction\nf0 (\u03be, \u03b7) = 1 \u2212 k\u03bek2 + \u03c7(k\u03bek)k\u03b7k2 .\nLet B be the open unit ball of H and let S be its boundary. We can embed Z as a closed infinite\ncodimensional submanifold of S. By the above lemma, there exists a smooth map \u03c6 : S \u2192 H such\nthat 0 is a regular value and Z = \u03c6\u22121 ({0}). Let C1 and C2 be two copies of the Hilbert manifold\nwith boundary B \u00d7 H, and consider the Hilbert manifold M := C1 \u222a\u03a6 C2 , where the gluing map\n\u03a6 is\n\u03a6 : \u2202C1 = S \u00d7 H \u2192 S \u00d7 H = \u2202C2 , (\u03be, \u03b7) 7\u2192 (\u03be, \u03b7 + \u03c6(\u03be)).\nLet F be the vector field on M coinciding with F0 on C1 and with \u2212F0 on C2 , and let f : M \u2192 R\nbe the function coinciding with f0 on C1 and with \u2212f0 on C2 . It is readily seen that F and\nf are well-defined and smooth, and that f is a non-degenerate Lyapunov function for F . By\nconstruction, C1 is negatively invariant for the flow of F , C2 is positively invariant, and there are\n\n19\n\n\fexactly two rest points x = (0, 0) \u2208 C1 and y = (0, 0) \u2208 C2 . Moreover, f \u22121 ({0}) = \u2202C1 = \u2202C2 ,\nand\nu\n\nW s (y) \u2229 \u2202C2 = S \u00d7 {0},\n\nu\n\nW (x) \u2229 \u2202C2 = \u03a6(W (x) \u2229 \u2202C1 ) = \u03a6(S \u00d7 {0}) = graph \u03c6.\nHence\nW s (y) \u2229 W u (x) \u2229 \u2202C2 = (S \u00d7 {0}) \u2229 graph \u03c6 = \u03c6\u22121 ({0}) \u00d7 {0} = Z \u00d7 {0},\nthe intersection being transversal, as required. Finally, since the gluing map \u03a6 is isotopic to the\nidentity map on S \u00d7 H, M is diffeomorphic to (B \u00d7 H) \u222aid (B \u00d7 H) = (B \u222aid B) \u00d7 H. Being\nan infinite dimensional sphere, B \u222aid B is diffeomorphic to H (again by [Bes66]), hence M is\ndiffeomorphic to H.\nGradient-like vector fields satisfying (C1-2). In particular, if Z has components of different\ndimension, the above example shows that in the case of infinite Morse indices and co-indices, the\ncomponents of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) may have different dimension. Actually, the discussion of section\n3 suggests that this phenomenon may happen also when F satisfies (C1-2) with respect to an\nessential subbundle, provided M is not simply connected. Indeed this is the case, as it is shown\nby the following example, where the vector field is actually the gradient of a smooth function.\nWe recall some pieces of notation from Appendix B. If A : [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e] \u2192 L(H) is a path of\nbounded linear operators with A(\u2212\u221e) and A(+\u221e) hyperbolic, we denote by XA : R \u2192 GL(H)\n\u2032\nthe solution of the linear Cauchy problem XA\n(t) = A(t)XA (t), XA (0) = I, and we consider the\nclosed linear subspaces\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\nWAs = \u03be \u2208 H | lim XA (t)\u03be = 0 , WAu = \u03be \u2208 H | lim XA (t)\u03be = 0 .\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nLet M = H \u00d7 T1 , with T1 = R/2\u03c0Z.

This intersection will be orientable when the vector field\nsatisfies (C1-2) with respect to a subbundle of T M .\nOrientation of Fredholm pairs. We need to recall some facts about the orientation bundle\non the space of Fredholm pairs. See Appendix A for more details. For H a real Hilbert space and\nn \u2208 N, we denote by Or(Grn,\u221e (H)) \u2192 Grn,\u221e (H) the orientation bundle of the Grassmannian of\nn-dimensional subspaces of H: the fiber of X \u2208 Grn,\u221e (H) consists of the two orientations of X.\nSimilarly, Or(Fp(H)) \u2192 Fp(H) denotes the orientation bundle of the space of Fredholm pairs:\nthe fiber of (V, W ) \u2208 Fp(H) consists of the two orientations of the finite dimensional vector space\n(V \u2229 W ) \u00d7 (H/(V + W ))\u2217 . This bundle is actually a double covering of Fp(H). If H \u2192 B is a\nHilbert bundle, we obtain the bundles Or(Grn,\u221e (H)) \u2192 B, Or(Fp(H)) \u2192 B, where\n[\n[\nOr(Grn,\u221e (H) =\nOr(Grn,\u221e (Hb )), Or(Fp(H) =\nOr(Fp(Hb )),\nb\u2208B\n\nb\u2208B\n\nand the maps\nOr(Grn,\u221e (H)) \u2192 Grn,\u221e (H),\n\nOr(Fp(H)) \u2192 Fp(H)\n\nare double coverings.\nLet n \u2208 N. If S(n, Fp) denotes the open set consisting of all (X, (V, W )) in Grn,\u221e (H) \u00d7 Fp(H)\nsuch that X \u2229 V = (0), the map S(n, Fp) \u2192 Fp(H), (X, (V, W )) 7\u2192 (X \u2295 V, W ), is continuous,\nand it lifts to a continuous map - the product of orientations V\n(oX , o(V,W ) ) 7\u2192 oX o(V,W ) ,\n22\n\n\ffrom the corresponding open subset of Or(Grn,\u221e (H)) \u00d7 Or(Fp(H)) to Or(Fp(H)).

Let V be a C 1 subbundle of T M , and let us assume that\nthe Morse vector field F satisfies (C1-2) with respect to V. By (C1) for every rest point x the\npair (Hxs , V(x)) is a Fredholm pair. Let us fix arbitrarily an orientation ox of (Hxs , V(x)). Let\nx, y \u2208 rest (F ) be such that W u (x) and W s (y) have a non-empty and transverse intersection.

The construction shows that it does\nnot depend on the choice of the immersions hux and hsy .\n\n6\n\nCompactness of Wu (x) \u2229 Ws (y)\n\nThe Palais-Smale condition. Let F be a gradient-like Morse vector field on M . Then the stable and unstable manifolds are (embedded) submanifolds, and so are their transverse intersections.\nWe would like to state a set of assumptions which imply that W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is pre-compact, i.e.\nit has compact closure in M . The first assumption is a version of the well known Palais-Smale\ncondition:\n6.1 Definition. Let F be a C 1 vector field on M , and f \u2208 C 1 (M ) be a Lyapunov function for F .\nA (PS) sequence for (F, f ) is a sequence (pn ) \u2282 M with f (pn ) bounded and Df (pn )[F (pn )] \u2192 0.\nThe pair (F, f ) satisfies the (PS) condition if every (PS) sequence is compact. We shall say that\nF satisfies (PS) if (F, f ) satisfies (PS) for some Lyapunov function f .\nWhen F is the negative gradient of a function f with respect to some Riemannian metric on M ,\none finds the usual notion of a Palais-Smale sequence: f (pn ) bounded and kDf (pn )k infinitesimal.\nSince Df (p)[F (p)] < 0 for p \u2208\n/ rest (F ), the limit points of the (PS) sequences are rest points\nof F . If (F, f ) satisfies (PS), then the set rest (F ) \u2229 {a \u2264 f \u2264 b} is compact for every a, b \u2208 R. If\nmoreover F is a Morse vector field, this set is also discrete, hence finite.\n6.2 Remark. (Genesis of (PS) sequences) Let (tn , pn ) \u2208 \u03a9(F ) be such that tn \u2192 +\u221e, and f (pn ),\nf (\u03c6(tn , pn )) are bounded. Then by the mean value theorem there exists sn \u2208 [0, tn ] such that\n(\u03c6(sn , pn )) is a (PS) sequence for (F, f ).\nThe second assumption is the completeness of F , that is the fact that the local flow \u03c6(t, *) of\nF is defined for every t, i.e. \u03a9(F ) = R \u00d7 M .\n\n6.3 Remark. Notice that multiplying F by a positive function does not change W u (x) \u2229 W s (y),\nwhereas it may have an effect on the validity of the (PS) and the completeness assumption. For\ninstance, multiplication by a suitably small function makes the vector field complete, while multiplication by a suitable large function makes (PS) true, when rest (F ) \u2229 f \u22121 ([a, b]) is compact for\nevery a, b \u2208 R. The two assumptions are meaningful here only when considered together.\n\nEssentially vertical families. As we shall see, the (PS) condition and the completeness imply\nthat W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) has compact closure, when either all the rest points of F have finite Morse\nindex, or they have finite Morse co-index. However, they are not sufficient in the general case.\nThe first assumption we need in the general case is that the essential subbundle E of T M\nshould have a strong integrable structure A modeled on (H, V ) (see Definition 1.1). In this case,\ndenoting by Q a linear projector with kernel V , we can introduce the following:\n24\n\n\f6.4 Definition. A family F of subsets of M is called an essentially vertical family for the strong\nintegrable structure A of E if it satisfies:\n(i) it is an ideal of P(M ), meaning that it is closed for finite unions and if A \u2208 F then any\nsubset of A is also in F ;\n(ii) every point p has a neighborhood U which is the domain of a chart \u03c6 \u2208 A such that every\nset A \u2282 U with \u03c6(A) bounded belongs to F if and only if Q\u03c6(A) is pre-compact.\nOnce an essentially vertical family F has been fixed, its elements will be called essentially\nvertical sets. Clearly, there can be many different essentially vertical families associated to the\nsame strong integrable structure of E, because only the \"small\" essentially vertical subsets are\ndetermined.\nThe family F will be called positively invariant if it is closed under the positive action of the\nflow \u03c6: for every A \u2208 F and every t \u2265 0, the set \u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 A) is in F .\nThe main result of this section is the following compactness theorem.\n6.5 Theorem. Assume that the Morse gradient-like vector field F is complete, satisfies (C1) with\nrespect to an essential subbundle E of T M , and satisfies (PS). Assume also that E has a strong\nintegrable structure A modeled on (H, V ) and an essentially vertical family F , which is positively\ninvariant for the flow of F .\nLet (pn ) \u2282 M , (sn ) \u2282 (\u2212\u221e, 0], (tn ) \u2282 [0, +\u221e), be such that (\u03c6(sn , pn )) converges to a rest\npoint x, while (\u03c6(tn , pn )) converges to a rest point y. Then the sequence (pn ) is compact.\nAn immediate consequence is the following corollary.\n6.6 Corollary. Under the assumptions of Theorem 6.5, for every x, y \u2208 rest (F ) the intersection\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is pre-compact.\nIn order to prove the above theorem, we need to establish the following lemma.\n6.7 Lemma. Let x be a rest point of F . Then x has a fundamental system of neighborhoods U\nsuch that:\n(i) the set W u (x) \u2229 U is essentially vertical;\n(ii) if A \u2282 U is essentially vertical, then A \u2229 W s (x) is pre-compact.\nFurthermore, if f is a non-degenerate Lyapunov function for F , for any sequence (pn ) \u2282 U\nconverging to x there holds:\n(iii) if tn \u2265 0 is such that \u03c6(tn , pn ) \u2208 \u2202U then the set {\u03c6(tn , pn ) | n \u2208 N} is essentially vertical,\nand\nlim sup f (\u03c6(tn , pn )) < f (x).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(iv) if tn \u2264 0 is such that \u03c6(tn , pn ) \u2208 \u2202U then the set {\u03c6(tn , pn ) | n \u2208 N} has a pre-compact\nintersection with any essentially vertical subset of M , and\nlim inf f (\u03c6(tn , pn )) > f (x).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nProof. By choosing a chart \u03c6 \u2208 A satisfying property (ii) in Definition 6.4, we can identify a\nneighborhood U of x in M with a bounded neighborhood - still denoted by U - of 0 in H, in such\na way that x corresponds to 0, the essential subbundle E is represented by the constant subbundle\nV , the kernel of a projector Q, and the essentially vertical subsets A \u2282 U are those for which QA\nis pre-compact.\nLet H = H u \u2295 H s , with projections P u , P s , be the splitting into the linear unstable and the\nstable spaces of the hyperbolic rest point 0. Endow H with an adapted norm k * k (see Appendix\nC), and denote by H u (r), H s (r) the closed r-balls of H u and H s , respectively. Up to reducing\n25\n\n\fthe neighborhood U , we may assume that U = H u (r) \u00d7 H s (r), where r > 0 is so small that all\nthe results of Appendix C hold.\nBy (C1), H u is a compact perturbation of V . Therefore, we may assume that Q is a compact\nperturbation of P s . By Remark 1.2 and by the boundeness of U , a subset A \u2282 U is essentially\nvertical if and only if P s A is pre-compact. In particular, the graph of a map \u03c3 : H u (r) \u2192 H s (r)\nis essentially vertical if and only if the map \u03c3 is compact.\nLet \u03c30 : H u (r) \u00d7 H s (r) be a 1-Lipschitz map. By the graph transform method (Proposition\nC.5), for every t \u2265 0 the set\n{\u03c6(t, \u03be) | \u03be \u2208 graph \u03c30 and \u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 {\u03be}) \u2282 H u (r) \u00d7 H s (r)}\nis the graph of a 1-Lipschitz map \u03c3t : H u (r) \u2192 H s (r), and \u03c3t converges uniformly to a map \u03c3 u\nu\nfor t \u2192 +\u221e, with graph \u03c3 u = Wloc,r\n(0), the local unstable manifold of 0. If \u03c30 is a compact\nmap - for example \u03c30 = 0 - the fact that the family F is positively invariant implies that \u03c3t is\na compact map for every t \u2265 0. By the uniform convergence, \u03c3 u is also compact, so the local\nu\nu\nunstable manifold Wloc,r\n(0) is an essentially vertical set. By Theorem C.7, Wloc,r\n(0) = W u (x)\u2229U ,\nproving (i).\ns\nThe local stable manifold Wloc,r\n(0) is the graph of a 1-Lipschitz map \u03c3 s : H s (r) \u2192 H u (r). Let\nA \u2282 U be an essentially vertical subset, that is P s A is pre-compact. Then\ns\nA \u2229 Wloc,r\n(0) = graph \u03c3 s |P s A\ns\nis also pre-compact. By Theorem C.7, Wloc,r\n(0) = W s (x) \u2229 U , proving (ii).\n\nLet (pn ) \u2282 U be a sequence converging to 0, and tn \u2265 0 such that \u03c6(tn , pn ) \u2208 \u2202U . By Lemma\nC.4,\nlim sup f (\u03c6(tn , pn )) < f (0),\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nu\nlim dist (\u03c6(tn , pn ), Wloc,r\n(0) \u2229 \u2202U ) = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThe first limit proves part of assertion (iii). By the second limit, we can find a sequence (qn ) \u2282\nu\nWloc,r\n(0) such that k\u03c6(tn , pn ) \u2212 qn k is infinitesimal. In particular kP s \u03c6(tn , pn ) \u2212 P s qn k is infinitesimal. By (i), the sequence (P s qn ) is compact. So also the sequence (P s \u03c6(tn , pn )) is compact. This\nproves that the set {\u03c6(tn , pn ) | n \u2208 N} is essentially vertical, concluding the proof of (iii).\nThe fact that \u03c3 s is 1-Lipschitz implies that\n\u221a\nkP u \u03be \u2212 \u03c3 s (P s \u03be)k \u2264 2 dist (\u03be, graph \u03c3 s ) \u2200\u03be \u2208 U.\n\n(6.1)\n\nIndeed, if \u03be \u2208 U and c > 1 we can find \u03b7 \u2208 graph \u03c3 s such that\nk\u03be \u2212 \u03b7k \u2264 c dist (\u03be, graph \u03c3 s ).\nSince P u \u03b7 = \u03c3 s (P s \u03b7) and since \u03c3 s is 1-Lipschitz,\nkP u \u03be \u2212 \u03c3 s (P s \u03be)k \u2264 kP u \u03be \u2212 P u \u03b7k + k\u03c3 s (P s \u03b7) \u2212 \u03c3 s (P s \u03be)k\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2264 kP u \u03be \u2212 P u \u03b7k + kP s \u03b7 \u2212 P s \u03bek \u2264 2k\u03be \u2212 \u03b7k \u2264 c 2 dist (\u03be, graph \u03c3 s ),\nand since c > 1 is arbitrary, (6.1) follows.\nNow assume that tn \u2264 0 are such that \u03c6(tn , pn ) \u2208 \u2202U . By Lemma C.4 applied to \u2212F ,\nlim inf f (\u03c6(tn , pn )) > f (0),\nn\u2192\u221e\n\ns\nlim dist (\u03c6(tn , pn ), Wloc,r\n(0) \u2229 \u2202U ) = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThe first limit proves part of assertion (iv). Let A \u2282 U be an essentially vertical set, that is P s A\nis pre-compact. If the set A \u2229 {\u03c6(tn , pn ) | n \u2208 N} is infinite (otherwise there is nothing to prove),\n26\n\n\fits elements form a subsequence (\u03c6(tnk , pnk )) such that the sequence (P s \u03c6(tnk , pnk )) is compact.\nBy the continuity of \u03c3 s , also the sequence (\u03c3 s (P s \u03c6(tnk , pnk ))) is compact. By (6.1),\n\u221a\nkP u \u03c6(tnk , pnk ) \u2212 \u03c3 s (P s \u03c6(tnk , pnk ))k \u2264 2 dist (\u03c6(tnk , pnk )), graph \u03c3 s )\n\u221a\ns\n(0) \u2229 \u2202U )\n\u2264 2 dist (\u03c6(tnk , pnk )), Wloc,r\nis infinitesimal, so also (P u \u03c6(tnk , pnk )) is compact. We deduce that (\u03c6(tnk , pnk )) is compact,\nconcluding the proof of (iv).\nProof [of Theorem 6.5]. Let f be a non-degenerate Lyapunov function for F such that (F, f )\nsatisfies (PS). Up to taking a subsequence of (pn ) and changing (sn ) and x, we may assume that\nfor no choice of a sequence (rn ) \u2282] \u2212 \u221e, 0], the sequence (\u03c6(rn , pn )) has a subsequence which\nconverges to a rest point z with f (z) < f (x). Indeed, since there are finitely many rest points z\nsuch that f (y) \u2264 f (z) \u2264 f (x), the set\nn\nZ := z \u2208 rest (F ) f (z) \u2264 f (x) and there exists (nk ) \u2282 N increasing and s\u2032k \u2264 0\no\nsuch that lim \u03c6(s\u2032k , pnk ) = z\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nis finite, and non-empty because it contains x. Let x\u2032 = limk\u2192\u221e \u03c6(s\u2032k , pnk ) be a point of Z where\nf attains its minimum. Then the latter requirement is verified with (pnk ), (s\u2032k ), and x\u2032 .\nSimilarly, by taking a further subsequence of (pn ), and by changing (tn ) and y, we may assume\nthat for no choice of a sequence (rn ) \u2282 R, the sequence (\u03c6(rn , pn )) has a subsequence which\nconverges to a rest point z with f (y) < f (z) < f (x). If either x or y is a cluster point for (pn )\nthere is nothing to prove, so we may assume that (pn ) is bounded away from x and y.\nBy Lemma 6.7 (iii), there exists a closed neighborhood U \u2282 M of x such that pn \u2208\n/ U , and\nchoosing s\u2032n \u2208]sn , 0[ such that \u03c6(s\u2032n , pn ) \u2208 \u2202U (for n large), we have\n{\u03c6(s\u2032n , pn ) | n \u2208 N} is essentially vertical,\nlim sup f (\u03c6(s\u2032n , pn ))\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n< f (x).\n\n(6.2)\n(6.3)\n\nBy Lemma 6.7 (iv), there exists a closed neighborhood V \u2282 M of y such that pn \u2208\n/ V , and choosing\nt\u2032n \u2208]0, tn [ such that \u03c6(t\u2032n , pn ) \u2208 \u2202V (for n large), we have\n{\u03c6(t\u2032n , pn ) | n \u2208 N} \u2229 A is pre-compact for every essentially vertical set A \u2282 M ,\nlim inf f (\u03c6(t\u2032n , pn )) > f (y).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(6.4)\n(6.5)\n\nThe (PS) condition implies that (t\u2032n \u2212 s\u2032n ) is bounded: otherwise by Remark 6.2, (6.3) and (6.5),\nwe would obtain a sequence (rn ) \u2282 R such that (\u03c6(rn , pn )) has a subsequence converging to a rest\npoint z, with f (y) < f (z) < f (x), contradicting our previous assumption. Therefore t\u2032n \u2212 s\u2032n \u2264 T\nfor every n \u2208 N.\nSince the essentially vertical family F is positively invariant, (6.2) implies that the set\n{\u03c6(t\u2032n , pn ) | n \u2208 N} \u2282 \u03c6([0, T ] \u00d7 {\u03c6(s\u2032n , pn ) | n \u2208 N})\nis essentially vertical. But then we can choose A = {\u03c6(t\u2032n , pn ) | n \u2208 N} in (6.4), and we obtain\nthat the sequence (\u03c6(t\u2032n , pn )) is compact. By the boundeness of t\u2032n and by the fact that the vector\nfield F is complete, we conclude that also the sequence (pn ) is compact.\n6.8 Remark. An argument similar to the one used above shows that, if F satisfies the assumptions\nof Theorem 6.5, x \u2208 rest (F ) and a \u2208 R, then the set W u (x) \u2229 {f \u2265 a} is essentially vertical.\n\n27\n\n\fExamples. Let us see what Theorem 6.5 says in the cases of finite Morse indices or co-indices.\n6.9 Example. (Vector fields whose rest points have finite Morse index or co-index) Notice that\nthe trivial subbundle E = (0) (relevant in the case of rest points with finite Morse index, see\nExample 2.2) has a strong integrable structure (choose any atlas of M ). The family consisting\nof all pre-compact subsets of M is a family of essentially vertical subsets for E = (0), and it is\nobviously closed under the action of the flow.\nSimilarly, the trivial subbundle E = T M (relevant in the case of rest points with finite Morse\nco-index) has a strong integrable structure (again, consider an arbitrary atlas of M ). The family\nconsisting of all subsets of M is a family of essentially vertical subsets for E = T M , clearly closed\nunder the action of the flow.\nWe have already seen that in the case E = (0) (resp. E = T M ) (C1) is equivalent to the fact\nthat all the rest points of F have finite Morse index (resp. co-index).\nTherefore the conclusion of Theorem 6.5 holds when (i) the C 1 vector field F is Morse and\ngradient-like, (ii) either all the rest points of F have finite Morse index, or they have finite Morse\nco-index, (iii) F satisfies (PS), and (iv) F is complete.\nNow let us look back at Example 2.3.\n6.10 Example. (Perturbations of a non-degenerate quadratic form) Assume that M = H is a\nHilbert space, and consider a function of the form\nf (\u03be) =\n\n1\nhL\u03be, \u03bei + b(\u03be),\n2\n\nwhere L \u2208 L(H) is self-adjoint invertible, and the gradient of the function b \u2208 C 2 (H) is a compact\nmap. Let F be the (negative) gradient vector field of f ,\nF (\u03be) = \u2212grad f (\u03be) = \u2212L\u03be \u2212 grad b(\u03be).\nIf grad b has linear growth - i.e. kgrad b(\u03be)k \u2264 c(1 + k\u03bek) for every \u03be \u2208 H - then F is complete,\nits flow \u03c6 maps bounded subsets of R \u00d7 H into bounded subsets of H, and it satisfies\nZ t\ne(s\u2212t)L grad b(\u03c6(s, \u03be)) ds.\n(6.6)\n\u03c6(t, \u03be) = e\u2212tL \u03be \u2212\n0\n\nConsider the constant subbundle V = V \u2212 (L), and the orthogonal projection Q with kernel V . This\nbundle has the trivial strong integrable structure modeled on (H, V ) consisting of the identity map:\nA = {I}. The family F consisting of all bounded subsets A of H such that QA is pre-compact is\nan essentially vertical family for A. Moreover the identity (6.6) together with the fact that grad b\nis a compact map implies that F is invariant for \u03c6.\nThe assumption that grad b has linear growth can be easily dropped. Indeed, the vector field\nF\u0303 (\u03be) = \u2212h(\u03be)grad f (\u03be),\n\nwhere h(\u03be) =\n\n1\n,\n1 + kgrad f (\u03be)k2\n\nis bounded, hence complete, and its flow \u03c6\u0303 maps bounded subsets of R \u00d7 H into bounded subsets of H. Notice that f is a non-degenerate Lyapunov function for F\u0303 , and since Df [F\u0303 ] =\n\u2212kgrad f k2 /(1 + kgrad f k2 ), the Palais-Smale sequences for (F\u0303 , f ) (in the sense of Definition 6.1)\nare exactly the Palais-Smale sequences for f (in the usual sense). The flow \u03c6\u0303 satisfies\n\u03c6\u0303(t, \u03be) = e\u2212\u03c4 (t,\u03be)L \u03be \u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nh(\u03c6\u0303(t, \u03be))e(\u03c4 (s,\u03be)\u2212\u03c4 (t,\u03be))L grad b(\u03c6\u0303(s, \u03be)) ds,\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c4 : R \u00d7 H \u2192 R is the function\n\u03c4 (t, \u03be) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nh(\u03c6\u0303(s, \u03be)) ds.\n\n0\n\n28\n\n\fThen |\u03c4 (t, \u03be)| \u2264 |t|, and the fact that grad b is a compact map again implies that the family F is\ninvariant for \u03c6\u0303.\nWe conclude that the thesis of the compactness Theorem 6.5 holds, when L is invertible and\nself-adjoint, b \u2208 C 2 (H) has compact gradient, and f satisfies the Palais-Smale condition.\nIn the case of a non-trivial subbundle E the question is how to find an essentially vertical family\nwhich is closed under the action of the flow of F . This question will be addressed in the next\nsection.\n\n7\n\nFlow-invariant essentially vertical families\n\nHausdorff measure of non-compactness. We recall that the Hausdorff distance of two subsets A, B of a metric space X is the number\nn\no\ndistH (A, B) = max sup inf dist (a, b), sup inf dist (a, b) \u2208 [0, +\u221e].\nb\u2208B a\u2208A\n\na\u2208A b\u2208B\n\nWe denote by H(X) the family of all closed subsets of X, and by Hb (X) the subfamily consisting\nof bounded subsets, which is a metric space with the Hausdorff distance. A related concept is the\nnotion of measure of non-compactness. If A is a subset of a metric space X, its Hausdorff measure\nof non-compactness is\n\u03b2X (A) := inf {r > 0 | A can be covered by finitely many balls of radius r} \u2208 [0, +\u221e].\nEquivalently, \u03b2X (A) is the distance from the set of compact subsets of X:\n\u03b2X (A) = inf {distH (A, K) | K \u2282 X compact} .\n\n(7.1)\n\nIt has the following properties (see [Dei85], section 2.7.3):\n(a) \u03b2X (A) < +\u221e if and only if A is bounded;\n(b) \u03b2X (A) = 0 if and only if A is totally bounded;\n(c) if A1 \u2282 A2 then \u03b2X (A1 ) \u2264 \u03b2X (A2 );\n(d) \u03b2X (A) \u2264 \u03b2A (A) \u2264 2\u03b2X (A);\n(e) \u03b2X (A1 \u222a A2 ) = max{\u03b2X (A1 ), \u03b2X (A2 )};\n(f) \u03b2X (A) = \u03b2X (A);\n(g) \u03b2X is continuous with respect to the Hausdorff distance.\nIf X is a normed vector space, denoting by co A the convex hull of A \u2282 X, we also have:\n(h) \u03b2X (\u03bbA) = |\u03bb|\u03b2X (A), and \u03b2X (A1 + A2 ) \u2264 \u03b2X (A1 ) + \u03b2X (A2 );\n(j) \u03b2X (co A) = \u03b2X (A).\nAdmissible presentations. We shall require that the essential subbundle E of T M has a strong\npresentation (see Definition 1.5) which satisfies the following finiteness and a uniformity conditions.\n7.1 Definition. A strong presentation {Mi , Ni , Qi }i\u2208I is called an admissible presentation if the\nHilbert manifolds Ni are endowed with complete Riemannian metrics, and\n(i) the covering {Mi }i\u2208I is star-finite (i.e. every Mi has non-empty intersection with finitely\nmany Mj 's);\n\n29\n\n\f(ii) there is r > 0 such that for every p \u2208 M there exists i \u2208 I such that\nQ\u22121\ni (Br (Qi (p))) \u2282 Mi .\nAn admissible presentation for E determines a strong integrable structure A (see Proposition\n1.4). Moreover, it determines a useful family of essentially vertical subsets of M . Indeed, let F be\nthe family of subsets A \u2282 M such that:\nA can be covered by finitely many Mi 's;\nfor every i \u2208 I, Qi (A \u2229 Mi ) is pre-compact.\n\n(7.2)\n(7.3)\n\nProposition 1.4 implies that this is a family of essentially vertical sets for the strong integrable\nstructure A.\nGiven an admissible presentation of E as above, we shall assume the following condition on the\nvector field F :\n(C3) (i) there is b > 0 such that kDQi \u25e6 F k\u221e \u2264 b for every i \u2208 I;\n\n(ii) for every i \u2208 I and q \u2208 Ni , there exists \u03b4 = \u03b4(q) > 0 and c = c(q) \u2265 0 such that\n\u03b2T Ni (DQi (F (A))) \u2264 c \u03b2Ni (Qi (A)),\n\n\u2200A \u2282 Q\u22121\ni (B\u03b4 (q)).\n\n(7.4)\n\nHere the tangent bundle T Ni is given the standard metric induced by the Riemannian structure\nof Ni . Notice that no Riemannian metric on M is involved in this condition.\n7.2 Remark. If (C3)-(ii) holds, we can replace the point q \u2208 Ni by a compact set K \u2282 Ni in\n(7.4): for every i \u2208 I and every compact set K \u2282 Ni , there exists \u03b4 = \u03b4(K) > 0 and c = c(K) \u2265 0\nsuch that\n\u03b2T Ni (DQi (F (A))) \u2264 c \u03b2Ni (Qi (A)), \u2200A \u2282 Q\u22121\ni (N\u03b4 (K)),\nwhere N\u03b4 (K) denotes the \u03b4-neighborhood of K.\n7.3 Remark. If E is a Hilbert space and Q : M \u2192 E is a C 1 map, one often makes no distinction\nbetween the tangential map DQ : T M \u2192 T E = E \u00d7 E, (p, \u03be) 7\u2192 (Q(p), DQ(p)[\u03be]), and its second\ncomponent DQ : T M \u2192 E, (p, \u03be) 7\u2192 DQ(p)[\u03be]. When Ni = E is a Hilbert space, we are allowed\nto replace the tangential map of Qi by its second component in (7.4), writing \u03b2E (DQi (F (A)))\ninstead of \u03b2E\u00d7E (DQi (F (A))) on the left-hand side of the inequality. Indeed, if S \u2282 T E = E \u00d7 E,\nand P1 , P2 : E \u00d7 E \u2192 E are the projections onto the first and the second factor, we have\nmax{\u03b2E (P1 S), \u03b2E (P2 S)} \u2264 \u03b2E\u00d7E (S) \u2264 \u03b2E (P1 S) + \u03b2E (P2 S).\nThe main result of this section is the following proposition.\n7.4 Proposition. Let {Mi , Ni , Qi }i\u2208I be an admissible presentation for the essential subbundle\nE of T M . Assume that the vector field F is complete and satisfies condition (C3). Then the\nessentially vertical family F defined by (7.2) and (7.3) is positively invariant for the flow of F .\nWe start with the following local result.\n7.5 Lemma. Let Q : M \u2192 E be a C 1 map into a Hilbert space. Let A \u2282 M be such that Q(A) is\npre-compact, and let t\u2217 \u2265 0 be such that [0, t\u2217 ] \u00d7 A \u2282 \u03a9(F ). Assume that there exists c \u2265 0 such\nthat\n\u03b2E (DQ(F (A\u2032 ))) \u2264 c \u03b2E (Q(A\u2032 )), \u2200A\u2032 \u2282 \u03c6([0, t\u2217 ] \u00d7 A).\n\nThen Q(\u03c6([0, t\u2217 ] \u00d7 A)) is pre-compact.\n\n30\n\n\fProof. Let n = \u230act\u2217 \u230b + 1, and set \u03c4 = t\u2217 /n, so that \u03c4 c < 1. For k \u2208 N, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, set\nAk = \u03c6([0, k\u03c4 ] \u00d7 A). Since\nZ\n1 t\nQ(\u03c6(t, p)) = Q(p) + t *\nDQ(\u03c6(s, p))[F (\u03c6(s, p))] ds,\nt 0\nwe have\nQ(Ak+1 ) = Q(\u03c6([0, \u03c4 ] \u00d7 Ak ) \u2282 Q(Ak ) + [0, \u03c4 ]co (DQ(F (Ak+1 ))).\n\nSo, by the properties (c), (h), and (j) of the Hausdorff measure of non-compactness, for 0 \u2264 k \u2264\nn \u2212 1 we have,\n\u03b2E (Q(Ak+1 )) \u2264 \u03b2E (Q(Ak )) + \u03c4 \u03b2E (co (DQ(F (Ak+1 ))))\n\u2264 \u03b2E (Q(Ak )) + \u03c4 \u03b2E (DQ(F (Ak+1 ))) \u2264 \u03b2E (Q(Ak )) + \u03c4 c\u03b2E (Q(Ak+1 )).\nSince \u03c4 c < 1,\n\n1\n\u03b2E (Q(Ak )), k = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n1 \u2212 \u03c4c\nand the fact that \u03b2E (Q(A0 )) = 0 implies that \u03b2E (\u03c6([0, t\u2217 ]\u00d7A)) = \u03b2E (Q(An )) = 0, as claimed.\n\u03b2E (Q(Ak+1 )) \u2264\n\n7.6 Example. The conclusion of the above lemma is not implied by the weaker assumption that\nQ(F (S)) should be compact for every set S such that Q(S) is compact, as the following example\nshows.\nLet H = l2 (Z), let {ek | k \u2208 Z} be its standard orthonormal basis, let H \u2212 = span {ek | k \u2264 0},\n+\nH = span {ek | k > 0}, and let Q be the orthogonal projector onto H \u2212 . Then there exists a\nsmooth bounded vector field F : H \u2192 H whose restriction to any set of the form\n{\u03be \u2208 H | |\u03be \u2212 \u03be0 | < r} + H \u2212 ,\n\n\u03be0 \u2208 H + , r < 1,\n\n(7.5)\n\nhas finite rank, and whose flow \u03c6 has the property that\nQ\u03c61 ({\u03be \u2208 H + | |\u03be| \u2264 1})\nis not compact. In particular, F (A) is compact and finite dimensional whenever \u03b2H \u2212 (QA) < 1.\nTo construct\nsuch a vector field, for k \u2208 N\u2217 choose two functions fk , gk \u2208 C \u221e (R) such that\np\nfk (s) = s + 1/k for s \u2208 [0, 2], kfk k\u221e \u2264 2, gk (1) = 1, gk (s) = 0 for s \u2264 1 \u2212 1/k, 0 \u2264 gk \u2264 1.

By the uniformity property of the presentation\n(Definition 7.1, (iv)), A = i\u2208I0 Ai .\n\n(iii) If Ai are the sets defined in (7.7), statement (i) implies that \u03c6([0, r/b[\u00d7Ai ) \u2282 Mi for every\ni \u2208 I0 . Therefore \u03c6([0, r/b[\u00d7A) is covered by the finite covering {Mi }i\u2208I0 , and the conclusion\nfollows by induction.\n\nProof [of Proposition 7.4]. By Lemma 7.7 (iii), \u03c6(0, t] \u00d7 A is covered by finitely many Mi\u2032 s, so\nit is enough to show that the interval\nT (A) = {t \u2265 0 | Qi (\u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 A)) is pre-compact in Ni , \u2200i \u2208 I}\ncoincides with [0, +\u221e[. Since 0 \u2208 T (A), we can argue by connectedness proving that T (A) is both\nopen and closed in [0, +\u221e[.\nS We claim that T (A) is open in [0, +\u221e[. Let t \u2208 T (A). By Lemma 7.7 (ii), \u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 A) =\ni\u2208I0 Ai , where\no\nn\n(7.8)\nAi = p \u2208 \u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 A) \u2229 Mi | Q\u22121\ni (Br (Qi (p))) \u2282 Mi ,\nT\nand I0 \u2282 I is finite. Clearly, T (A) = [0, t]+ i\u2208I0 T (Ai ), so it is enough to prove that sup T (Ai ) >\n0, for every i \u2208 I0 .\nLet i \u2208 I0 . Since Qi (Ai ) is pre-compact, (C3)-(ii), together with Remark 7.2, implies that\nthere exist c \u2265 0 and \u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u03b2T Ni (DQi \u25e6 F (S)) \u2264 c\u03b2Ni (Qi (S))\n\n\u2200S \u2282 Q\u22121\ni (N\u03b4 (Qi (Ai ))).\n\n(7.9)\n\nMoreover, Qi (Ai ) is covered by finitely\nSnmany coordinate neighborhoods: there exist q1 , . . . , qn \u2208\nQi (Ai ), 0 < \u03c1 \u2264 min{\u03b4, r}, Qi (Ai ) \u2282 j=1 B\u03c1/2 (qj ), and local charts\n\u03c8j : dom (\u03c8j ) \u2192 E,\n\nSn\nwith B\u03c1 (qj ) \u2282 dom (\u03c8j ), \u03c8j (B\u03c1 (qj )) \u2282 dom (\u03c8j\u22121 ), and \u03c8j\u22121 , D\u03c8j Lipschitz. Then Ai = j=1 Aji ,\nj\nwith Aji = Ai \u2229 Q\u22121\ni (B\u03c1/2 (qj )). Again, it suffices to show that sup T (Ai ) > 0.\nLet 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, and set U = Q\u22121\ni (B\u03c1 (qj )). Since \u03c1 \u2264 r and qj \u2208 Qi (Ai ), by the definition of Ai\nwe have\nU \u2282 Q\u22121\n(7.10)\ni (Br (qj )) \u2282 Mi .\n32\n\n\fLet p \u2208 Aji \u2282 Mi . Let [0, \u03c4 (p)[, 0 < \u03c4 (p) \u2264 +\u221e, be the maximal interval of positive numbers s for\nwhich \u03c6(s, p) \u2208 U . By Lemma 7.7 (i),\ndist (Qi (\u03c6(s, p)), qj ) \u2264 dist (Qi (\u03c6(s, p)), Qi (p)) + dist (Qi (p), qj ) \u2264 bs + \u03c1/2\nfor every s \u2208 [0, \u03c4 (p)[. Together with (7.10) this implies that \u03c4 (p) \u2265 \u03c1/(2b). Therefore\n\u03c6([0, \u03c1/(2b)[\u00d7Aji ) \u2282 U.\n\n(7.11)\n\nLet Q := \u03c8j \u25e6 Qi : U \u2192 E. Since \u03c1 \u2264 \u03b4 and qj \u2208 Qi (Ai ), U is contained in Q\u22121\ni (N\u03b4 (Qi (Ai ))).\nBy (7.9), for any S \u2282 U ,\n\u03b2E ((DQi \u25e6 F )(S)) \u2264 \u03b2E\u00d7E ((DQ \u25e6 F )(S)) = \u03b2E\u00d7E (D\u03c8j \u25e6 DQi (F (S)))\n\u2264 lip(D\u03c8j )\u03b2T Ni (DQi \u25e6 F (S)) \u2264 c lip(D\u03c8j )\u03b2Ni (Qi (S))\n= c lip(D\u03c8j )\u03b2N1 (\u03c8j\u22121 (Q(S))) \u2264 c lip(D\u03c8j ) lip(\u03c8j\u22121 )\u03b2E (Q(S)).\n\nBy (7.11), we can take S = \u03c6([0, \u03c1/(2b)[\u00d7Aji ) in the above inequality, and Lemma 7.5 implies that\nQ(\u03c6([0, \u03c1/2b[\u00d7Aji )) is pre-compact in E.\nSince B\u03c1 (qj ) \u2282 dom (\u03c8j ) and \u03c8j (B\u03c1 (qj )) \u2282 dom (\u03c8j\u22121 ), the set\nQi (\u03c6([0, \u03c1/(2b)[\u00d7Aji )) = \u03c8j\u22121 (Q(\u03c6([0, \u03c1/(2b)[\u00d7Aji )))\nis a compact subset of Ni . Therefore sup T (Aji ) \u2265 \u03c1/(2b) > 0, as we wished to prove.\nThere remains\nS to show that the interval T (A) is closed. Let t = sup T (A). By Lemma 7.7 (ii),\n\u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 A) = i\u2208I0 Ai , where Ai is defined in (7.8) and I0 \u2282 I is finite. It is enough to prove\nthat Qi (Ai ) has compact closure in Ni , for any i \u2208 I0 .\nFix i \u2208 I0 , and let qk = Qi (\u03c6(t, pk )), where pk \u2208 A and \u03c6(t, pk ) \u2208 Ai , be a sequence in Qi (Ai ).\nBy Lemma 7.7 (i), \u03c6(t \u2212 \u03c4, pk ) \u2208 Mi for any 0 \u2264 \u03c4 < r/b, and\ndist (Qi (\u03c6(t \u2212 \u03c4, pk )), qk ) \u2264 b\u03c4.\n\n(7.12)\n\nSince t = sup T (A), the sequence (Qi (\u03c6(t \u2212 \u03c4, pk )))k\u2208N is compact for any 0 < \u03c4 < r/b. Then\n(7.12) and the completeness of Ni imply that also the sequence (qk ) is compact, proving that\nQi (Ai ) is pre-compact.\nProperties of condition (C3). Condition (C3) is stronger than (C2), and like (C2) it is a\nconvex condition. Indeed, the following result holds.\n7.8 Proposition. Let {Mi , Ni , Qi }i\u2208I be an admissible presentation of the essential subbundle\nE. The following facts hold:\n(i) condition (C3) implies condition (C2);\n(ii) the vector fields F satisfying (C3) form a module over the ring C 1 (M ) \u2229 Cb0 (M )\nProof. (i) Let i \u2208 I, p \u2208 Mi , and set q := Qi (p). Up to the composition with C 1 local charts\n\u03c6 : dom (\u03c6) \u2282 Mi \u2192 H, p \u2208 dom (\u03c6),\n\n\u03c8 : dom (\u03c8) \u2282 Ni \u2192 E, q \u2208 dom (\u03c8),\n\nsuch that \u03c8, and D\u03c8 are bi-Lipschitz, we may assume that Qi is a C 1 semi-Fredholm map with\nind Qi \u2265 0 from an open set of the Hilbert space H into the Hilbert space E. By (C3)-(ii) and\nRemark 7.3, there exist \u03b4 > 0 and c \u2265 0 such that\n\u03b2E (DQi (F (A))) \u2264 c\u03b2E (Qi (A))\n\n33\n\n\u2200A \u2282 Q\u22121\ni (B\u03b4 (q)).\n\n(7.13)\n\n\fLet T \u2208 L(H, E) be a linear map with finite rank such that DQi (p) + T is surjective. Since T has\nfinite rank,\n\u03b2E (Qi (A)) = \u03b2E ((Qi + T )(A)),\n\n\u03b2E (DQi (F (A))) = \u03b2E (D(Qi + T )(F (A))).\n\n(7.14)\n\nThe map Qi + T is a local submersion at p, so up to considering a change of variable at p, we may\nassume that the restriction of Qi to a neighborhood U of p coincides with a linear surjective map\nQ from H to E, which by (7.13) and (7.14) verifies\n\u03b2E (QF (A)) \u2264 c\u03b2E (QA) \u2200A \u2282 Q\u22121 (B\u03b4 (q)) \u2229 U.\n\n(7.15)\n\nBy composing with a linear right inverse of Q, we may also assume that E is a closed subspace\nof H and that Q is a linear projector onto E. In these coordinates, the essential subbundle E is\nlocally represented by the constant subbundle ker Q, with projector P = I \u2212 Q. By (7.15), the\nmap (I \u2212 P )F P is compact in a neighborhood of p, so its differential at p,\nD((I \u2212 P )F P )(p) = (I \u2212 P )DF (p)P = (LF P )(p)P,\nis a compact operator, proving (C2).\n(ii) Let F1 and F2 be C 1 tangent vector fields on M , and let h1 , h2 \u2208 C 1 (M ) \u2229 Cb0 (M ). Let\ni \u2208 I. Clearly, if F1 and F2 satisfy (C3)-(i) with constants b1 and b2 , h1 F1 + h2 F2 satisfy (C3)-(i)\nwith constant kh1 k\u221e b1 + kh2 k\u221e b2 .\nLet p \u2208 Mi , and set q := Qi (p).

By property (h) of the Hausdorff measure of non-compactness, if\nA \u2282 Q\u22121\ni (U ),\n\u03b2T Ni (DQi \u25e6 (h1 F1 + h2 F2 )(A)) \u2264 2\u03b2E\u00d7E (D\u03c8 \u25e6 DQi \u25e6 (h1 F1 + h2 F2 )(A))\n\u2264 2kh1 k\u221e \u03b2E\u00d7E (D\u03c8 \u25e6 DQi \u25e6 F1 (A)) + 2kh2 k\u221e \u03b2E\u00d7E (D\u03c8 \u25e6 DQi \u25e6 F2 (A))\n\u2264 4kh1 k\u221e \u03b2T Ni (DQi \u25e6 F1 (A)) + 4kh2 k\u221e \u03b2T Ni (DQi \u25e6 F2 (A)).\n\nTherefore, if F1 and F2 satisfy (7.4) with constants \u03b41 , c1 and \u03b42 , c2 , then h1 F1 + h2 F2 satisfies\n(7.4) with constants \u03b4 = min{\u03b41 , \u03b42 } and c = 4kh1 k\u221e c1 + 4kh2k\u221e c2 . This proves that h1 F1 + h2 F2\nsatisfies (C2)-(ii).\nIt seems useful to find sufficient conditions implying (C3)-(ii), which do not make use of the\nmeasures of non-compactness but are stated only in terms of Lipschitzianity and compactness of\nsome maps. To this purpose, assume that M is endowed with a Riemannian metric.\nThe following proposition says that under mild Lipschitz assumptions on Q\u22121\ni and F , condition\n(C3)-(ii) holds if and only if the maps DQi \u25e6 F : Q\u22121\ni ({q}) \u2192 Tq Ni have pre-compact image.\nExample 7.6 suggests that without Lipschitz assumptions on F the last condition is not sufficient\nfor the conclusion of Proposition 7.4 to hold.\n7.9 Proposition.

(Product manifolds) Let us consider again the situation of Example 2.4: M =\nM \u2212 \u00d7 M + is given a product complete Riemannian structure, and V = T M \u2212 \u00d7 (0). Consider the\nprojection onto the second factor Q : M \u2192 M + , (p\u2212 , p+ ) 7\u2192 p+ , and the admissible presentation\nof the subbundle V,\n\b\nQ|B \u2212 \u00d7B + | B \u2212 \u00d7 B + \u2282 M \u2212 \u00d7 M + is bounded .\n\nWriting the tangent vector field F as F (p\u2212 , p+ ) = (F \u2212 (p\u2212 , p+ ), F + (p\u2212 , p+ )) \u2208 Tp\u2212 M \u2212 \u00d7 Tp+ M + ,\nthere holds DQ \u25e6 F (p\u2212 , p+ ) = F + (p\u2212 , p+ ). Assume that (i) F + is bounded, and (ii) for every\np+ \u2208 M + and for every bounded set B \u2212 \u2282 M \u2212 there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that F + is Lipschitz on\nB \u2212 \u00d7 B\u03b4 (p+ ), and that the map M \u2212 \u2192 Tp+ M + , p\u2212 7\u2192 F + (p\u2212 , p+ ) is compact. Then Proposition\n7.9 implies that F satisfies (C3).\n35\n\n\f8\n\nBroken flow lines\n\nLet x and y be rest points of the gradient-like Morse vector field F . Let us assume that W u (x) \u2229\nW s (y) has compact closure. Consider a sequence of flow lines from the rest point x to the rest\npoint y, and the sequence of their closures:\nSn = \u03c6(R \u00d7 {pn }) = \u03c6(R \u00d7 {pn }) \u222a {x, y},\n\npn \u2208 W u (x) \u2229 W s (y).\n\nSince W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is compact, up to a subsequence we may assume that pn \u2192 p, and the\ncontinuity of \u03c6 would give us the convergence\n\u03c6(*, pn ) \u2192 \u03c6(*, p)\nuniformly on compact subsets of R. However, it may happen that p \u2208\n/ W u (x), or p \u2208\n/ W s (y), so\n\u03c6(*, p) could be a flow line connecting two other rest points, and the convergence would not be\nuniform on R. We will show that in this case a subsequence of (Sn ) converges to a broken flow\nline in the Hausdorff distance. The discussion is independent on conditions (C1-3), and involves\nonly the compactness of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y).\n8.1 Definition. Let x, y \u2208 rest (F ). A broken flow line from x to a y is a set\nS = S1 \u222a * * * \u222a Sk ,\nwhere k \u2265 1, Si is the closure of a flow line from zi\u22121 to zi , where x = z0 6= z1 6= * * * 6= zk\u22121 6=\nzk = y are rest points.\nWhen k = 1, a broken flow line is just the closure of a genuine flow line. Let us fix a Lyapunov\nfunction f for F . If S is a broken flow line as in the above definition, the following inequalities\nmust hold:\nf (x) > f (z1 ) > * * * > f (zk\u22121 ) > f (y).\n(8.1)\nIt is easy to check that a compact set S \u2282 M is a broken flow line from x to y if and only if (i)\nx, y \u2208 S, (ii) S is \u03c6-invariant, (iii) the intersection\nS \u2229 {p \u2208 M | f (p) = c}\nconsists of a single point if c \u2208 [f (y), f (x)], and it is empty otherwise. Now we can state the\ncompactness result for the gradient flow lines.\n8.2 Proposition. Assume that the Morse vector field F has a Lyapunov function f , and that\nx, y are rest points such that W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is compact. Let (pn ) \u2282 W u (x) \u2229 W s (y), and set\nSn := \u03c6(R \u00d7 {pn }) \u222a {x, y}. Then (Sn ) has a subsequence which converges to a broken flow line\nfrom x to y, in the Hausdorff distance.\nProof. The space of compact subsets of a compact metric space is compact with respect to the\nHausdorff distance, so (Sn ) has a subsequence (Sn\u2032 ) which converges to a compact set S \u2282\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y). Then x, y \u2208 S, and since Sn\u2032 is \u03c6-invariant, so is S. Since Sn\u2032 \u2282 f \u22121 ([f (y), f (x)]),\nwe obtain that the set\nS \u2229 {p \u2208 M | f (p) = c}\n(8.2)\nis empty for every c \u2208\n/ [f (y), f (x)].\nLet c \u2208 [f (y), f (x)]. Then (Sn\u2032 ) has a subsequence (Sn\u2032\u2032 ) such that\nSn\u2032\u2032 \u2229 {p \u2208 M | f (p) = c}\nconverges to some point in (8.2), which is then non-empty. If the set (8.2) contains two points\np, q, the fact that (Sn ) is a sequence of flow lines allows us to find a sequence (pn ) converging to\n\n36\n\n\fp, and numbers tn \u2208 R such that \u03c6(tn , pn ) \u2192 q. By reversing if necessary the role of p and q, we\nmay assume that tn \u2265 0 for every n, and we deduce the convergence:\nZ tn\nDf (\u03c6(t, pn ))[F (\u03c6(t, pn ))] dt = f (\u03c6(tn , pn )) \u2212 f (pn ) \u2192 f (q) \u2212 f (p) = 0.\n0\n\nThen the fact that the rest points of f are isolated easily implies that either tn \u2192 0, or the\nsequence of sets \u03c6([0, tn ] \u00d7 {pn }) converges to a rest point. In both cases, we obtain that p = q.\nThis shows that the set (8.2) consists of a single point. Hence S is a broken flow line from x to\ny.\n\n9\n\nIntersections of dimension 1 and 2\n\nAssume that the gradient-like Morse vector field F satisfies (C1-2) with respect to a (0)-essential\nsubbundle E of T M , so that the relative index m(x, E) is a well-defined integer, for any x \u2208 rest (F ).\nWe say that F satisfies the Morse-Smale property up to order k, if W u (x) and W s (y) have\ntransverse intersection for every pair of rest points x, y such that m(x, E) \u2212 m(y, E) \u2264 k. The\nMorse-Smale condition up to order 0 implies that, for a broken flow line as in Definition 8.1,\nm(x, E) > m(z1 , E) > * * * > m(zk\u22121 , E) > m(y, E).\n\n(9.1)\n\nIn this section we shall assume that F has the Morse-Smale property up to order 2, and we shall\ndescribe the intersections W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) when m(x, E) \u2212 m(y, E) is either 1 or 2. As in the\nlast section, we shall assume that such an intersection has compact closure. By Theorem 3.3,\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is a submanifold of dimension 1, respectively 2. The flow \u03c6 defines a free action\nof the group R onto W u (x) \u2229 W s (y), so the quotient, that is the set of the flow lines from x to y,\nis a manifold of dimension 0, respectively 1.\nAssume that x, y are rest points with\nm(x, E) \u2212 m(y, E) = 1.\n\n(9.2)\n\nWe claim that W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) consists of finitely many connected components. Indeed each\nconnected component is a flow line from x to y, and the set C of their closures is discrete in the\nHausdorff distance. On the other hand, (9.1) and (9.2) imply that these are the only broken flow\nlines from x to y. So by Proposition 8.2, C is also compact, hence finite.\nNote that the restriction of the flow \u03c6 to the closure of a component of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) is\nconjugated to the shift flow on R = [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e]:\nR \u00d7 R \u220b (t, u) 7\u2192 u + t \u2208 R.\nNow assume that x, z are rest points with\nm(x, E) \u2212 m(z, E) = 2.\n\n(9.3)\n\nThe quotient of each connected component W by this action, W/R, being a connected onedimensional manifold, is either the circle or the open interval. In other words a connected component W of W u (x) \u2229 W s (z) is described by a one-parameter family of flow lines u\u03bb , where \u03bb ranges\nin S 1 or in ]0, 1[.\nIn the first case one can easily verify that W = W \u222a {x, z} is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere,\nand that the restriction of \u03c6 to W is conjugated to the exponential flow on the Riemann sphere\nS 2 = C \u222a {\u221e}:\nR \u00d7 S 2 \u220b (t, \u03b6) 7\u2192 et \u03b6 \u2208 S 2 .\nIn the second case, by Proposition 8.2, W \\ W contains broken flow lines, which have just one\nintermediate rest point, by (9.1) and (9.3). Then the flow \u03c6 restricted to W is semi-conjugated\nto the product of two shift-flows on R. More precisely, the situation is described by the following\ntheorem.\n37\n\n\f9.1 Theorem. Assume that the gradient-like Morse vector field F satisfies (C1-2) with respect\nto a (0)-essential subbundle E of T M . Assume that F has the Morse-Smale property up to order\n2. Let x, z be rest points such that m(x, E) \u2212 m(z, E) = 2, and let W be a connected component\nof W u (x) \u2229 W s (z) such that W is compact, and W/R is an open interval. Then there exists a\ncontinuous surjective map\nh:R\u00d7R\u2192W\nwith the following properties:\n(i) \u03c6t (h(u, v)) = h(u + t, v + t), for every (u, v) \u2208 R \u00d7 R, t \u2208 R;\n(ii) h(R2 ) = W , and there exist rest points y, y \u2032 with m(y, E) = m(y \u2032 , E) = m(x, E) \u2212 1, and W1 ,\nW2 , W1\u2032 , W2\u2032 connected components of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y), W u (y) \u2229 W s (z), W u (x) \u2229 W s (y \u2032 ),\nW u (y \u2032 ) \u2229 W s (z), respectively, such that W1 \u222a W2 6= W1\u2032 \u222a W2\u2032 , and\nh(R \u00d7 {\u2212\u221e}) = W1 ,\n\nh({+\u221e} \u00d7 R) = W2 ,\n\nh({\u2212\u221e} \u00d7 R) = W1\u2032 ,\n\nh(R \u00d7 {+\u221e}) = W2\u2032 .\n\n(iii) the restrictions of h to R2 , to {\u00b1\u221e} \u00d7 R, and to R \u00d7 {\u00b1\u221e}, are diffeomorphisms of class\nC 1;\n(iv) if moreover the (0)-essential subbundle E can be lifted to a subbundle V, then\ndeg h = \u2212 deg h|{\u2212\u221e}\u00d7R * deg h|R\u00d7{+\u221e} = deg h|R\u00d7{\u2212\u221e} * deg h|{+\u221e}\u00d7R ,\nwhere deg denotes the Z-topological degree, referred to the orientations defined in section 5.\nConcerning (ii), note that it may happen that y = y \u2032 , and in this case even that W1 = W1\u2032 or\nW2 = W2\u2032 , but the last two identities cannot hold simultaneously. When y 6= y \u2032 , h is injective, so\nit is a conjugacy. Statement (iv) expresses the coherence we need between the orientations of the\none-dimensional and two-dimensional intersections of unstable and stable manifolds. The picture\nis completed by the following proposition.\n9.2 Proposition. Assume that the gradient-like Morse vector field F satisfies (C1-2) with respect\nto a (0)-essential subbundle E of T M . Assume that F has the Morse-Smale property up to order\n2. Let x, y, z be rest points such that m(x) = m(y) + 1 = m(z) + 2, and let W1 , W2 be connected\ncomponents of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y), W u (y) \u2229 W s (z), respectively. Then there exists\nn a unique connected\no\n\ncomponent W of W u (x)\u2229W s (z) such that W1 \u222a W2 belongs to the closure of \u03c6(R \u00d7 {p}) | p \u2208 W\nwith respect to the Hausdorff distance.\n\nBoth Theorem 9.1 and Proposition 9.2 will be proved in section 11. The main tool in the proof\nis the graph transform method, which allows us to study suitable portions of W u (x) and W s (z)\nin a neighborhood of another rest point y \u2208 W u (x) \u2229 W s (z).\n\n10\n\nThe boundary homomorphism\n\nLet (M, E) be a pair consisting of a complete Riemannian Hilbert manifold M of class C 2 , and of a\nC 1 (0)-essential subbundle of T M having an admissible presentation. Let F be a C 1 Morse vector\nfield on M , admitting a non-degenerate Lyapunov function f . We shall assume (PS), (C1-3), the\nMorse-Smale property up to order 2, and\n(C4) for every q \u2208 Z, f is bounded below on restq (F ) = {x \u2208 rest (F ) | m(x, E) = q}.\n\n38\n\n\fMorse complex with coefficients in Z. We first consider the situation in which E is the\n(0)-essential class of a subbundle V of T M . In this case we can fix arbitrary orientations of the\nFredholm pairs (Hxs , V(x)), for every x \u2208 rest (F ).\nLet x and y be rest points with m(x, E) \u2212 m(y, E) = 1, and let W be a connected component\nof W u (x) \u2229 W s (y). Then W is a flow line, and it is endowed with the orientation described in\nsection 5. We can define the number\n\u03c3(W ) := deg[\u03c6(*, p) : R \u2192 W ],\nfor p \u2208 W . In other words \u03c3(W ) equals +1 or \u22121 depending on whether F (p) \u2208 Tp W is positively\nor negatively oriented. We define also\nX\n\u03c3(x, y) :=\n\u03c3(W ),\nW\n\nwhere the sum ranges over all the connected components of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y).\nNow let x and z be rest points with m(x, E) \u2212 m(z, E) = 2, and let S(x, z) be the set of\nbroken flow lines from x to z with one intermediate rest point (necessarily unique and of index\nm(z, E) + 1). By (PS) and by the Morse assumption there are finitely many rest points y with\nf (y) \u2208]f (z), f (x)[. By Theorem 6.5 and Proposition 8.2, the set S(x, z) is finite. By Theorem 9.1\nand Proposition 9.2, there is an involution W1 \u222a W2 7\u2192 W1\u2032 \u222a W2\u2032 without fixed points on the set\nS(x, z), and\n\u03c3(W1\u2032 )\u03c3(W2\u2032 ) = \u2212\u03c3(W1 )\u03c3(W2 ).\n(10.1)\nLet q \u2208 Z and let Cq (F ) be the free Abelian group generated by the rest points of index q:\nCq (F ) = spanZ restq (F ).\n\nNote that Cq (F ) may have infinite rank.\nAssumption (C4) allows us to define the homomorphism\n\u2202q : Cq (F ) \u2192 Cq\u22121 (F )\nby setting for every x \u2208 restq (F )\n\u2202q x =\n\nX\n\n\u03c3(x, y)y.\n\n(10.2)\n\ny\u2208restq\u22121 (F )\n\nThe modules Cq (F ) together with the homomorphisms \u2202q are the data of a chain complex. Indeed\nwe have:\n10.1 Theorem. For every q \u2208 Z, \u2202q\u22121 \u25e6 \u2202q = 0.\nProof. Let x \u2208 restq (F ) and z \u2208 restq\u22122 (F ). The coefficient of z in \u2202q\u22121 \u2202q x is\nX\nX\n\u03c3(x, y)\u03c3(y, z) =\n\u03c3(W1 )\u03c3(W2 ),\ny\u2208restq\u22121 (F )\n\nW1 \u222aW2 \u2208S(x,z)\n\nwhich is zero by (10.1).\nWe will call {Cq (F ), \u2202q }q\u2208Z the Morse complex of F . Clearly, the construction depends on the\nchoice of the subbundle V and on the orientation of each Fredholm pair (Hxs , V(x)). Changing\nthe subbundle V by a compact perturbation changes the Morse complex by a shift of the indices\n(when M is connected). A change of the orientation of (Hxs , V(x)) produces an isomorphic Morse\ncomplex.\nMorse complex with coefficients in Z2 . In the general case of a (0)-essential subbundle\nE, statement (iv) of Theorem 9.1 is not available, but we can still define a Morse complex with\nZ2 coefficients. Indeed, defining \u03c3(x, y) \u2208 Z2 to be the number of connected components of\nW u (x) \u2229 W s (y) counted modulo 2, and Cq (F ) to be the Z2 -vector space generated by the rest\npoints of index q, (10.2) defines a complex of Z2 -vector spaces.\n39\n\n\f11\n\nProof of the conjugacy theorem\n\nConstruction of h near a broken flow line. The main point in the proof of Theorem 9.1\nand Proposition 9.2 is to construct h near a broken gradient flow line.\n11.1 Proposition. Assume that the Morse vector field F has a non-degenerate Lyapunov function\nf , satisfies (C1-2) with respect to a (0)-essential subbundle E of T M , and satisfies the Morse-Smale\ncondition up to order 2. Let x, y, z be rest points such that m(x, E) = m(y, E) + 1 = m(z, E) + 2.\nLet W1 and W2 be connected components of W u (x) \u2229 W s (y) and W u (y) \u2229 W s (z), respectively.\nThen there exists a continuous injective map\n\b\nh : \u2206 := (u, v) \u2208 R \u00d7 R | v \u2264 u \u2192 W u (x) \u2229 W s (z)\n\nwith the following properties:\n\n(i) \u03c6t (h(u, v)) = h(u + t, v + t), for every (u, v) \u2208 \u2206, t \u2208 R;\n(ii) h(\u2206 \u2229 R2 ) \u2282 W u (x) \u2229 W s (z), h(R \u00d7 {\u2212\u221e}) = W1 , h({+\u221e} \u00d7 R) = W2 , and the restrictions\nof h to \u2206 \u2229 R2 , to R \u00d7 {\u2212\u221e}, and to {+\u221e} \u00d7 R, are diffeomorphisms of class C 1 ;\n(iii) there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for any p \u2208 W u (x) \u2229 W s (z), if S = \u03c6(R \u00d7 {p}) has Hausdorff\ndistance less than \u03b4 from W1 \u222a W2 , then S \u2282 h(\u2206);\n(iv) if moreover the (0)-essential subbundle E can be lifted to a subbundle V, then\ndeg h = \u2212 deg h|R\u00d7{\u2212\u221e} * deg h|{+\u221e}\u00d7R ,\nwhere deg denotes the Z-topological degree, referred to the orientations defined in section 5.\nLet us identify a neighborhood of y in M with a neighborhood of 0 in the Hilbert space H,\nidentifying y with 0. We endow H with an equivalent Hilbert product h*, *i which is adapted to\n\u2207F (y) = DF (0) (see Appendix C), and we set H u := Hyu , H s := Hys , so that H u \u2295 H s is the\nsplitting of H given by the decomposition of the spectrum of \u2207F (y) into the subset with positive\nreal part and the one with negative real part. Let P u and P s denote the corresponding projectors.\nWe shall often identify H = H u \u2295 H s with H u \u00d7 H s . By H u (r), resp.

Let r be as small as required by Propositions C.5 and C.6. Since Tp1 X \u2295Tp1 W s (y) = Tp1 M ,\nthe path of subspaces D\u03c6t (p1 )Tp1 X converges to Ty W u (y) for t \u2192 +\u221e, by Theorem B.2 (iii).\nTherefore, we can find s1 \u2265 0 such that \u03c6(s1 , p1 ) is in the interior of Q(r), and D\u03c6s1 (p1 )Tp1 X \u2282\nH u \u00d7 H s is the graph of a linear operator from H u to H s of norm strictly less than 1. By the\nimplicit function theorem, there exists \u03c1 > 0 such that \u03c6s1 (X \u2229B\u03c1 (p1 )) is the graph of a 1-Lipschitz\nmap \u03c3 : U \u2192 H s (r), where U \u2282 H u (r) is open. Moreover, graph \u03c3 \u2229 W s (y) = {\u03c6(s1 , p1 )}, so by\nProposition C.5 (v), there exist s2 \u2265 0 and \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 Lip1 (H u (r), H s (r)) such that\ngraph \u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c6s1 +s2 (X \u2229 B\u03c1 (p1 )) \u2229 Q(r),\nwhere we have also used Proposition C.6. Let\n\u0393 : [0, +\u221e] \u00d7 Lip1 (H u (r), H s (r)) \u2192 Lip1 (H u (r), H s (r))\nbe the graph transform map provided by Proposition C.5.

Setting t0 :=\ns1 + s2 + s3 and \u03c3t = \u0393(t \u2212 s3 , \u03c3 \u2032 ) for t \u2208 [0, +\u221e], statements (i), (ii), and the first part of (v)\nfollow immediately from Propositions C.5 and C.6.\nChanging the sign of t and considering the evolution of Z, we obtain a family of maps {\u03c4t }\nsatisfying (iii), (iv), and the second part of (v).\nProof. (of Proposition 11.1) Let \u03b8 be a positive number strictly less than 1, and let r0 , \u03c1, t0 , \u03c3t , \u03c4t\nbe as in the lemma above. Since \u03b8 < 1, the contracting mapping principle implies the existence\nof a Lipschitz continuous map\n\u039b : Lip\u03b8 (H u (r0 ), H s (r0 )) \u00d7 Lip\u03b8 (H s (r0 ), H u (r0 )) \u2192 Q(r0 ),\nwhich associates to (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) the unique intersection of the graphs of \u03c3 and \u03c4 , i.e. the unique fixed\npoint of the contraction\nH u (r0 ) \u00d7 H s (r0 ) \u220b (\u03be, \u03b7) 7\u2192 (\u03c4 (\u03b7), \u03c3(\u03be)) \u2208 H u (r0 ) \u00d7 H s (r0 ).\nFor (u, v) \u2208 [0, +\u221e] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, 0], set\n(\n\u03c6u+t0 (X \u2229 B\u03c1 (p1 )) \u2229 Q(r0 ),\nXu =\nW u (y) \u2229 Q(r0 ),\n(\n\u03c6v\u2212t0 (Z \u2229 B\u03c1 (p2 )) \u2229 Q(r0 ),\nZv =\nW s (y) \u2229 Q(r0 ),\n\nif u \u2208 [0, +\u221e[,\n,\nif u = +\u221e,\nif v \u2208] \u2212 \u221e, 0],\nif v = \u2212\u221e.\n\nThen we define h(u, v) to be the unique point of the intersection Xu \u2229 Zv . The map h is well\ndefined and continuous on [0, +\u221e] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, 0] because it can be written as the composition\n\u039b\n\n[0, +\u221e] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, 0] \u220b (u, v) 7\u2192 (\u03c3u , \u03c4v ) \u2212\u2192 Q(r0 ) \u0592\u2192 M.\nSince X and Z are contained in level sets of f , and they contain no rest points, Xu \u2229Xu\u2032 = \u2205 if u 6=\nu\u2032 , and Zv \u2229 Zv\u2032 = \u2205 if v 6= v \u2032 . So h is injective. By definition, for every (u, v) \u2208 [0, +\u221e] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, 0],\nand \u2212u \u2264 t \u2264 \u2212v,\n\u03c6t (h(u, v)) = h(u + t, v + t),\n(11.1)\n41\n\n\fand we can use formula (11.1) to extend h to a continuous injective map on\n\b\n\u2206 = (u, v) \u2208 R \u00d7 R | v \u2264 u ,\n\nstill verifying (11.1), proving (i). Since X \u2282 W u (x) and Z \u2282 W s (z), for every (u, v) \u2208 \u2206 \u2229 R2 the\npoint h(u, v) belongs to W u (x) \u2229 W s (z). Since\nh(u, \u2212\u221e) = \u03c6(u, p1 ),\n\nand h(+\u221e, v) = \u03c6(v, p2 ),\n\nh|R\u00d7{\u2212\u221e} and h|{+\u221e}\u00d7R are diffeomorphisms of class C 1 onto W1 and W2 . Since X and Z are\nof class C 1 and so is \u03c6, the implicit function theorem implies that h|\u2206\u2229R2 is a diffeomorphism of\nclass C 1 , proving (ii).

Unless otherwise stated, detailed proofs can be found in [AM03a]\n(but see also [Pal65, Luf67, Qui85, SW85, PS86, CJS95, Shu96]).\nThe Hilbert Grassmannian and the space of Fredholm pairs. By L(E, F ), respectively\nLc (E, F ), we will denote the space of continuous linear, respectively compact linear, maps from\nthe Banach space E to the Banach space F . If F = E we will use the abbreviations L(E) and\nLc (E). The norm of the operator T \u2208 L(E, F ) will be denoted by kT k. By \u03c3(L) and by \u03c3ess (L)\nwe will denote the spectrum and the essential spectrum of the operator L \u2208 L(E), that is the\nspectrum of [L] in the Calkin algebra L(E)/Lc (E).\nLet H be a real infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. The orthogonal projection onto a\nclosed subspace V \u2282 H will be denoted by PV , while V \u22a5 will denote the orthogonal complement\nof V in H.\nLet Gr(H) be the Grassmannian of H, i.e. the set of closed linear subspaces of H. The\nassignment V 7\u2192 PV is an inclusion of Gr(H) into L(H), onto the closed subset of the orthogonal\nprojectors of H. We can therefore define, for any V, W \u2208 Gr(H) the distance\ndist (W1 , W2 ) := kPW1 \u2212 PW2 k,\nwhich makes Gr(H) a complete metric space. It can be proved that Gr(H) is an analytic Banach\nsubmanifold of the Banach space L(H): indeed, the subspace of symmetric idempotent elements\nof a C \u2217 -algebra is always an analytic Banach submanifold.\n48\n\n\fThe connected components of Gr(H) are the subsets\nGrn,k (H) := {V \u2208 Gr(H) | dim V = n, codimV = k} ,\n\nn, k \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}, n + k = \u221e.\n\nThe orthogonal group O(H) is contractible, by a well known result by Kuiper [Kui65], and it\nacts transitively on each of these components. These facts imply that Gr\u221e,\u221e (H) is contractible,\nwhile Grn,\u221e (H) and Gr\u221e,n (H) have the homotopy type of BO(n), the classifying space of the\northogonal group of Rn .\nA pair (V, W ) of closed subspaces of H is said a Fredholm pair if V \u2229 W is finite dimensional,\nand V + W is finite codimensional (see also [Kat80], section IV \u00a74). In this situation, the index of\n(V, W ) is the number\nind (V, W ) = dim V \u2229 W \u2212 codim(V + W ).\n\nThe set of Fredholm pairs in H will be denoted by Fp(H): it is open in Gr(H) \u00d7 Gr(H), and the\nindex is a continuous function on Fp(H). The connected components of Fp(H) are the subsets\nFp\u2217k (H)\n\nGrn,\u221e (H) \u00d7 Gr\u221e,m (H),\n\nGr\u221e,n (H) \u00d7 Grm,\u221e (H),\n\nn, m \u2208 N,\n\n:= {(V, W ) \u2208 Fp(H) | V, W \u2208 Gr\u221e,\u221e (H), ind (V, W ) = k} ,\n\nk \u2208 Z.\n\nThe space of Fredholm pairs consisting of infinite dimensional spaces will be denoted by\n[\nFp\u2217 (H) :=\nFp\u2217k (H).\nk\u2208Z\n\nFp\u2217k (H)\n\nhas the homotopy type of BO(\u221e), the classifying space of the\nIt can be proved that\ninfinite real orthogonal group O(\u221e) = limn\u2192\u221e O(n). So Fp\u2217 (H) is homotopically equivalent to\nZ \u00d7 BO(\u221e), and by the Bott periodicity theorem we get\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2Z for i \u2261 0, 4 mod 8,\n\u2217\n\u03c0i (Fp (H)) = Z2 for i \u2261 1, 2 mod 8,\n(A.1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\nfor i \u2261 3, 5, 6, 7 mod 8.\n\nWe conclude this section with a result about the existence of hyperbolic rotations, which will\nbe useful in Appendix B.\nA.1 Proposition. Let V, W \u2208 Gr\u221e,\u221e (H) be such that dist (V, W ) < 1. Then there exists\nA \u2208 L(H) self-adjoint, invertible, with \u03c3ess (A) \u2229 R\u2212 6= \u2205, \u03c3ess (A) \u2229 R+ 6= \u2205, such that eA V = W .\nProof. Since dist (V, W ) < 1, W = graph L, with L = PV \u22a5 (PV |W )\u22121 \u2208 L(V, V \u22a5 ).

The spectral mapping theorem implies that\n{(s \u2212 \u03b8)(s \u2212 1/\u03b8) | s \u2208 \u03c3(S)} \u2282 [0, 1[,\nso we have\n\u03c3(S) \u2282]0, \u03b8] \u222a [1/\u03b8, 1/\u03b8 + \u03b8[ \u2282 ]0, 1[ \u222a ]1, +\u221e[,\n\nfor any \u03b7 \u2208 [0, \u03b8]. For \u03b7 = 0, \u03c3ess (S) = {\u03b8, 1/\u03b8}, so by the semi-continuity of the essential spectrum\n\u03c3ess (S)\u2229]0, 1[6= \u2205,\n\n\u03c3ess (S)\u2229]1, +\u221e[6= \u2205,\n\nfor any \u03b7 \u2208 [0, \u03b8]. In particular for \u03b7 = \u03b8, A = log S is a well-defined operator satisfying the\nrequirements.\n49\n\n\fThe determinant and the orientation of Fredholm pairs. Let n \u2208 N. The Grassmannian\nof n-dimensional linear subspaces Grn,\u221e (H) is the base space of a non-trivial real line bundle, the\ndeterminant bundle\nDet(Grn,\u221e (H)) \u2192 Grn,\u221e (H),\n\nwhose fiber at X \u2208 Grn,\u221e (H) is the line Det(X) := \u039bdim X (X), the component of the exterior\nalgebra of X consisting of tensors of top degree. Such a line bundle has a natural analytic structure.\nIts Z2 reduction is the non-trivial double covering\nOr(Grn,\u221e (H)) \u2192 Grn,\u221e (H),\ncalled the orientation bundle, whose fiber at X is the set Or(X) consisting of the two elements of\nDet(X) \\ {0}/R+.

This line bundle is also non-trivial,\nand its Z2 reduction is the non-trivial double covering\nOr(Fp(H)) \u2192 Fp(H),\ncalled the orientation bundle over Fp(H), whose fiber at (V, W ) is the set Or(V, W ) consisting of\nthe two elements of Det(V, W ) \\ {0}/R+. If o(V,W ) is an element of Or(V, W ), the other element\nwill be denoted by \u2212o(V,W ) . Note that the fundamental group of each component of Fp\u2217 (H) is\nZ2 , so the restriction of the orientation bundle to Fp\u2217 (H) is the universal covering of Fp\u2217 (H).\n50\n\n\fIf n \u2208 N, the space\nS(n, Fp) = {(X, (V, W )) \u2208 Grn,\u221e (H) \u00d7 Fp(H) | X \u2229 V = (0)}\nis the base space of the line bundle\nDet(S(n, Fp)) \u2192 S(n, Fp),\nwhose fiber at (X, (V, W )) is the line Det(X) \u2297 Det(V, W ), and there is an analytic morphism\nV\nV\n: Det(S(n, Fp)) \u2192 Det(Fp(H)), \u03c9X \u2297 \u03c9(V,W ) 7\u2192 \u03c9X \u03c9(V,W )\n\nwhich lifts the analytic map (X, (V, W )) \u2192 (X +V, W ).

We shall say that the closed linear subspace\nW is a compact perturbation of V if its orthogonal projector PW is a compact perturbation of PV .\nThe subspace W is a compact perturbation of W if and only if the operators PV \u22a5 PW and PW \u22a5 PV\nare compact. The notion of compact perturbation produces an equivalence relation, and the\nGrassmannian of compact perturbations of V ,\nGr(V, H) := {W \u2208 Gr(H) | W is a compact perturbation of V }\nis a closed subspace of Gr(H). If V has finite dimension (respectively finite codimension), then\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[\n[\nGr(V, H) =\nGrn,\u221e (H),\nresp. =\nGr\u221e,n (H) .\nn\u2208N\n\nn\u2208N\n\nIn the more interesting case, V has both infinite dimension and infinite codimension. In such a\nsituation, Gr(V, H) is a closed proper subset of Gr\u221e,\u221e (H). It is an analytic Banach manifold, although just a C 0 Banach submanifold of Gr(H). This space is also called restricted Grassmannian\nby some authors (see [SW85, PS86, CJS95]).\nIf W is a compact perturbation of W , then (V, W \u22a5 ) is a Fredholm pair, and the relative\ndimension of V with respect to W is the integer\ndim(V, W ) := ind (V, W \u22a5 ) = dim V \u2229 W \u22a5 \u2212 dim V \u22a5 \u2229 W.\nWhen V and W are finite dimensional (resp. finite codimensional), we have dim(V, W ) = dim V \u2212\ndim W (resp. dim(V, W ) = codimW \u2212 codimV ).\n51\n\n\fA.2 Proposition. ([AM03a], Proposition 5.1) If (V, Z) is a Fredholm pair and W is a compact\nperturbation of V , then (W, Z) is a Fredholm pair, with\nind (W, Z) = ind (V, Z) + dim(W, V ).\nIn particular, if V, W, Y are compact perturbations of the same subspace,\ndim(Y, V ) = dim(Y, W ) + dim(W, V ).\n\n(A.2)\n\nNor the notion of compact perturbation, neither the relative dimension depend on the choice of\nan equivalent inner product in H.\nA.3 Proposition. ([AM01], Proposition 2.3) Let H1 , H2 be Hilbert spaces and let T, S \u2208 L(H1 , H2 )\nbe operators with closed range and compact difference. Then ker T is a compact perturbation of\nker S, ran T is a compact perturbation of ran S, and\ndim(ran T, ran S) = \u2212 dim(ker T, ker S).\nA.4 Proposition. Let T \u2208 GL(H), V \u2208 Gr(H), and let P be a projector onto V . Then T V is a\ncompact perturbation of V if and only if the operator (I \u2212 P )T P is compact.\nProof. By choosing a suitable inner product on H, we may assume that P = PV is an orthogonal\nprojector. The operator L := T P + T \u2217\u22121 (I \u2212 P ) is invertible, and PT V = T P L\u22121. Therefore, T V\nis a compact perturbation of V if and only if the operator\n(PT V \u2212 PV )L = (I \u2212 P )T P \u2212 P T \u2217 \u22121 (I \u2212 P ) =: S\nis compact.\nNow, if S is compact, so is (I \u2212 P )T P = SP . On the other hand, since the set\n{X \u2208 GL(H) | (I \u2212 P )XP \u2208 Lc (H)}\nis a subgroup of GL(H), if (I \u2212 P )T P is compact so is (I \u2212 P )T \u22121 P .

The connected components of Gr(V, H) are the subsets\nGrn (V, H) := {W \u2208 Gr(V, H) | dim(W, V ) = n} ,\n\nn \u2208 Z.\n\nThese components are pairwise diffeomorphic. Each of these components has the homotopy type\nof BO(\u221e), so the homotopy groups of Gr(V, H) are those listed in (A.1).\nWe conclude this section with a result about the kernel of semi-Fredholm operators.\nA.5 Proposition. Let A, B \u2208 L(H1 , H2 ) be continuous linear operators between Hilbert spaces,\nwith finite-codimensional range. Assume that the restrictions A|ker B and B|ker A are compact.\nThen ker A is a compact perturbation of ker B, the operator AB \u2217 \u2208 L(H2 ) is Fredholm, and\nind (AB \u2217 ) = dim coker B \u2212 dim coker A + dim(ker A, ker B).\n\n(A.3)\n\nProof. Since A has closed range, there exists S \u2208 L(H2 , H1 ) such that SA = P(ker A)\u22a5 . Then\nP(ker A)\u22a5 Pker B = SAPker B is compact, and symmetrically so is P(ker B)\u22a5 Pker A . Therefore ker A is\na compact perturbation of ker B. Moreover, AP(ker B)\u22a5 = A \u2212 APker B is a compact perturbation\nof A, so it has closed range ran (AP(ker B)\u22a5 ) = ran (AB \u2217 ). Since (AB \u2217 )\u2217 = BA\u2217 , the exactness of\nthe sequences\nB\u2217\n\n0 \u2192 ker B \u2217 \u0592\u2192 ker(AB \u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 ker A \u2229 (ker B)\u22a5 \u2192 0,\nA\u2217\n\n0 \u2192 ker A\u2217 \u0592\u2192 ker(BA\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 ker B \u2229 (ker A)\u22a5 \u2192 0,\n\nimplies that AB \u2217 is Fredholm and that (A.3) holds.\n52\n\n\fEssential Grassmannians. If m \u2208 N, we define the (m)-essential Grassmannian Gr(m) (H) to\nbe the quotient space of Gr(H) by the equivalence relation\n{(V, W ) \u2208 Gr(H) \u00d7 Gr(H) | V is a compact perturbation of W and dim(V, W ) \u2208 mZ} .\nThe (1)-essential Grassmannian is simply called essential Grassmannian. If E \u2208 Gr(m) (H) and\nV \u2208 Gr(H) is commensurable to the subspaces belonging to the equivalence class E,\ndim(V, E) := dim(V, W ),\n\nW \u2208 E,\n\ndefines an element of Z/mZ.\nThe essential Grassmannian Gr(1) (H) is homeomorphic to the space of symmetric idempotent\nelements of the Calkin algebra L(H)/Lc (H), hence it inherits the structure of a complete metric\nspace, and of an analytic submanifold of the Calkin algebra.\nEvery set Grn,\u221e (H) or Gr\u221e,n (H), n \u2208 N, represents an isolated point in Gr(0) (H), which has\nthus countably many isolated points. If m \u2265 1, the sets\n[\n[\nGrn,\u221e (H) and\nGr\u221e,n (H), k = 0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1,\nn\u2208mZ+k\n\nn\u2208mZ+k\n\nrepresent 2m isolated points in Gr(m) (H). The remaining part of Gr(m) (H) is connected, being\nthe quotient space of Gr\u221e,\u221e (H), and it is denoted by Gr\u2217(m) (H).\nThe space Gr\u2217(0) (H) is simply connected, while the fundamental group of Gr\u2217(m) (H) for m \u2265 1\nis infinite cyclic. If m \u2265 1 divides k \u2208 N, the natural projection\nGr\u2217(k) (H) \u2192 Gr\u2217(m) (H)\nis a covering map.

A bounded linear operator L \u2208 L(H) is said hyperbolic if its\nspectrum does not meet the imaginary axis. In such a case, let H = V + (L) \u2295 V \u2212 (L) be the Linvariant splitting of L into closed subspaces, corresponding to the decomposition of the spectrum\nof L into positive and negative real part.\nB.1 Proposition. ([AM01], Proposition 2.2) Let L, L\u2032 \u2208 L(H) be hyperbolic operators. If L\u2032 is\na compact perturbation of L, then V + (L\u2032 ) is a compact perturbation of V + (L), and V \u2212 (L\u2032 ) is a\ncompact perturbation of V \u2212 (L).\nLet A : [0, +\u221e] \u2192 L(H) (resp.

The following proposition\ncharacterizes those paths A for which the evolution of the linear stable space remains in a fixed\nessential class:\nB.3 Proposition. ([AM03b], Proposition 3.8) Let A : [0, +\u221e] \u2192 L(H) be a piecewise continuous\npath such that A(+\u221e) is hyperbolic. Let V be a closed subspace of H, and let P be a projector\nonto V . Then the following statements are equivalent:\n(i) XA (t)WAs is a compact perturbation of V for any t \u2265 0;\n(ii) V \u2212 (A(+\u221e)) is a compact perturbation of V and [A(t), P ]P is compact for any t \u2265 0.\nThe proof of the above proposition is based on the following fact: if V is a closed linear subspace\nof H, then the orthogonal projector P (t) onto XA (t)V solves the Riccati equation\nP \u2032 (t) = (I \u2212 P (t))A(t)P (t) + P (t)A(t)\u2217 (I \u2212 P (t)),\nas shown in [AM03b], formula (35).\n54\n\n(B.1)\n\n\fNow let A : [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e] \u2192 L(H) be a continuous path such that A(\u2212\u221e) and A(+\u221e) are\nhyperbolic. If C00 (R, H) (resp. C01 (R, H)) denotes the Banach space of continuous curves u : R \u2192 H\nsuch that u(t) is infinitesimal (resp. u(t) and u\u2032 (t) are infinitesimal) for t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, we can consider\nthe bounded linear operator\nFA : C01 (R, H) \u2192 C00 (R, H),\n\n(FA u)(t) = u\u2032 (t) \u2212 A(t)u(t).\n\nIts main properties are listed in the following:\nB.4 Theorem. ([AM03b], Theorem 5.1 and Remark 5.1) Let A : [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e] \u2192 L(H) be a\ncontinuous path such that A(\u2212\u221e) and A(+\u221e) are hyperbolic. Then:\n(i) FA has closed range if and only if the linear subspace WAs + WAu is closed;\n(ii) FA is surjective if and only if WAs + WAu = H;\n(iii) FA is injective if and only if WAs \u2229 WAu = (0);\n(iv) FA is a Fredholm operator if and only if (WAs , WAu ) is a Fredholm pair, and in this case\nind FA = ind (WAs , WAu ).\nIt is easy to build examples of paths A having two arbitrary closed linear subspaces as linear\nstable space and linear unstable space, so the above theorem shows that in general FA may not\nhave closed range, and its kernel and cokernel may be infinite dimensional. Even FA is Fredholm,\nA(t) is self-adjoint and invertible for any t, and A(\u2212\u221e) = A(+\u221e), the operator FA may still\nhave any index. In the following proposition we exhibit such an example with positive index. By\nTheorem B.2 (v), we obtain an example with negative index by considering the path B(t) = \u2212A(t).\nB.5 Proposition.

In particular, FA is a surjective Fredholm operator of index k.\n\nProof. Let W \u2282 H + be a linear subspace of dimension k. Since Gr\u221e,\u221e (H) is connected, there\nexist closed subspaces V0 = H \u2212 \u2295W, V1 , . . . , Vm\u22121 , Vm = H \u2212 in Gr\u221e,\u221e (H) with dist (Vj\u22121 , Vj ) < 1\nfor any j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} (in fact it is possible to take m = 4). Denote by S the open subset of\nSym(H) consisting of the invertible operators A with \u03c3ess (A) \u2229 R\u00b1 6= \u2205.

For any r > 0 small enough there is a continuous (nonlinear) semigroup\n\u0393 : [0, +\u221e] \u00d7 Lip1 (H u (r), H s (r)) \u2192 Lip1 (H u (r), H s (r))\nsuch that for every \u03c3 \u2208 Lip1 (H u (r), H s (r)) there holds:\n(i) \u0393(0, \u03c3) = \u03c3, and \u0393(t + s, \u03c3) = \u0393(t, \u0393(s, \u03c3)), for every t, s \u2208 [0, +\u221e];\n(ii) for every t \u2208 [0, +\u221e[, the restriction of \u03c6t to Q(r) maps the graph of \u03c3 onto the graph of\n\u0393(t, \u03c3), that is\ngraph \u0393(t, \u03c3) = {\u03c6(t, \u03be) | \u03be \u2208 graph \u03c3 and \u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 {\u03be}) \u2282 Q(r)} ;\nu\n(iii) graph \u0393(+\u221e, \u03c3) = Wloc,r\n(0);\n\n(iv) for any \u03b8 > 0 there exists r0 \u2208]0, r] and t0 \u2265 0 such that the restriction of \u0393(t, \u03c3) to H u (r0 )\nis in Lip\u03b8 (H u (r0 ), H s (r0 )), for any t \u2208 [t0 , +\u221e] and any \u03c3 \u2208 Lip1 (H u (r), H s (r)).\nFurthermore:\ns\n(v) if V \u2282 H u (r) is open and \u03c3 \u2208 Lip1 (V, H s (r)) is such that graph \u03c3 \u2229 Wloc,r\n(0) 6= \u2205, then there\n\u2032\nu\ns\nexists t \u2265 0 and \u03c3 \u2208 Lip1 (H (r), H (r)) such that the restriction of \u03c6t to Q(r) maps the\ngraph of \u03c3 onto the graph of \u03c3 \u2032 , that is\n\ngraph \u03c3 \u2032 = {\u03c6(t, \u03be) | \u03be \u2208 graph \u03c3 and \u03c6([0, t] \u00d7 {\u03be}) \u2282 Q(r)} .\n7 We recall that this conjugacy is found as a fixed point of a contraction T on a suitable space of continuous maps\n(see [Shu87], chapter 7). Since for \u03b1 \u2208]0, 1[ small enough, the space of \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous maps is T -invariant,\nsuch a conjugacy turns out to be H\u00f6lder continuous together with its inverse. In general, it needs not be even\nLipschitz continuous.\n\n58\n\n\fGlobal statements. Now let F be a C 1 vector field on the real Hilbert manifold M , and let\n\u03c6 : \u03a9(F ) \u2192 M , \u03a9(F ) \u2282 R \u00d7 M , denote its local flow. Let x be a hyperbolic rest point of F . We\ncan identify a neighborhood of x in M with a neighborhood of 0 in the Hilbert space H, identifying\nx with 0. We denote by H = H u \u2295 H s the splitting of H associated to the hyperbolic operator\n\u2207F (x) = DF (0), and we endow H with an equivalent inner product adapted to \u2207F (x), as in the\nprevious section. For r > 0 small enough, we set\nQ(r) = H u (r) \u00d7 H s (r),\n\nQ+ (r) = \u2202H u (r) \u00d7 H s (r),\n\nQ\u2212 (r) = H u (r) \u00d7 \u2202H s (r).\n\nLemma C.2 and the last statement of Lemma C.4 have the following consequence.\nC.6 Proposition. For any r > 0 small enough there holds:\n(i) if p \u2208 Q(r) and \u03c6(t, p) \u2208\n/ Q(r) for some t > 0, then there exists s \u2208 [0, t[ such that \u03c6(s, p) \u2208\nQ+ (r);\n(ii) if p \u2208 Q(r) and \u03c6(t, p) \u2208\n/ Q(r) for some t < 0, then there exists s \u2208]t, 0] such that \u03c6(s, p) \u2208\nQ\u2212 (r).\nMoreover, if F admits a global C 1 Lyapunov function which is twice differentiable and nondegenerate at x:\n(iii) if p \u2208 Q+ (r), then \u03c6(t, p) \u2208\n/ Q(r) for any t > 0;\n(iv) if p \u2208 Q\u2212 (r), then \u03c6(t, p) \u2208\n/ Q() for any t < 0.\nThe unstable and stable manifolds of x are the \u03c6-invariant subsets of M\n\u001a\n\u001b\nW u (x) = p \u2208 M | ] \u2212 \u221e, 0] \u00d7 {p} \u2282 \u03a9(F ) and lim \u03c6(t, p) = x ,\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\u001a\n\u001b\nW s (x) = p \u2208 M | [0, +\u221e[\u00d7{p} \u2282 \u03a9(F ) and lim \u03c6(t, p) = x .\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nThe local stable manifold theorem (Theorem C.3) and Proposition C.6 imply:\nC.7 Theorem. The sets W u (x) and W s (x) are images of C 1 injective immersions\neu : H u \u2192 M,\n\nes : H s \u2192 M,\n\nsuch that eu (0) = es (0) = x, and Deu (0) and Des (0) are the identity mappings. If moreover F\nadmits a global C 1 Lyapunov function which is twice differentiable and non-degenerate at x, then\nfor any r > 0 small enough\nu\nW u (x) \u2229 Q(r) = Wloc,r\n(0),\n\ns\nW s (x) \u2229 Q(r) = Wloc,r\n(0),\n\nand the maps eu , es are embeddings, so that W u (x) and W s (x) are C 1 submanifolds of M .\n\nReferences\n[AM01]\n\nA.
