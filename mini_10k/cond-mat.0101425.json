Under the combined action of thermal fluctuations and small temporal modulation of the tilt of the\npotential the particles , in the small tilt range, become more mobile than without modulation. The\nenhancement of mobility depends (nonmonotonically) on the frequency of modulation. For small\nmodulations the enhancement shows a peak as a function of frequency. This has an obvious implication on the measured voltage across a Josephson junction driven by a small amplitude alternating\ncurrent of suitable frequency.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.-a, 05.40.Jc, 05.60.Cd\n\nThe inertia of a particle plays spectacular role when\nthe motion is very feebly damped even when the effective\napplied force is very small. The temperature of the system helps overcome the effect of damping on the motion\nsignificantly. The present work concerns motion of such\nparticles in a periodic potential system of period 2\u03c0/k\nand amplitude V0 . When a tilt as small as F0 = 0.07V0 k\nis given to the potential at a temperature T = 0.4V0 /kB ,\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, the particles make\nseveral, at times hundreds, of crossings across the potential peaks before making a \"halt\" in a potential well.\nThe particles start and continue the journey (on the average downhill) again assisted by thermal fluctuations.\nThe intervals of these continued motions and halts (that\nis, the intervals of the particles being in running and\nlocked states, respectively) are not regular but must follow broad distributions. A more or less similar picture\nappears when the potential tilt is modulated periodically\nin time with amplitude \u2206F = 0.01V0 k, 0.02V0 k, ..etc\n(Fig. 1). It has been shown earlier that upon modulation\nthe mobility of the particle exhibits hysteretic behavior.\nThe condition of criticality of such hysteresis loops and\ncorresponding jump distributions, which show transition\nbetween exponential to power law behavior, have been\ndiscussed in reference [1]. It is also stated there that\nno appreciable hysteresis loop could be obtained if the\naverage tilt F0 is chosen relatively far from a threshold\nvalue dependent on the product of the friction coefficient\n\u03b30 and V0 . We find that if the friction coefficient becomes space dependent, and in particular periodic with\nthe same periodicity 2\u03c0/k but with a phase shift \u03c6 and\namplitude \u03bb, appreciable hysteresis loops can be obtained\nfor values of F0 roughly in the range between 0.05V0 k and\n0.14V0 k. The periodically varying friction coefficient corresponds analogously to the term representing interference between the quasiparticle tunneling and the Cooper\npair tunneling across Josephson junctions [2]. The inclusion of nonuniform friction coefficient does not give\n\nqualitatively different result. However, quantitatively it\nmakes difference. We, therefore, consider space dependent friction coefficient in our study.\n20000\n\u03bb = 0, \u2206F = 0\n\u03bb = .9, \u2206F = 0\n\n15000\n\n\u03bb = 0, \u2206F = .01\n\u03bb = .9, \u2206F = .01\n\nx\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0101425v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 29 Jan 2001\n\nEnhancement of mobility by periodically modulating the slanting slope of a\nwashboard potential\n\n10000\n\nPSfrag replacements\n5000\n\n0\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nt\n\nFIG. 1.

The external force has two parts one\ngiving the average tilt to the potential and other giving\nthe time periodic modulation: F (t) =DF0 +E\u2206F cos(\u03a9t).\nThe fluctuating term f\u02c6(t) satisfies f\u02c6(t) = 0 and\nD\nE\nf\u02c6(t)f\u02c6(t\u2032 ) = 2\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) and may represent thermal noise\nat temperature T .

The interesting\naspect to note in the figure, which is also the main result of this paper, is that for a range of values of small\nF0 (the range depending on the value of \u2206F ) the average mobility is larger for \u2206F 6= 0 than for \u2206F = 0.\nThe result indicates that the mobility has been enhanced\nby modulating the slanting (small F0 , smaller than the\nknown critical values [1]) slope of the periodic potential.\nIn other words, the effective friction could be reduced\nbelow the mean friction just by modulating the potential periodically. It is worth mentioning that in tribology\nsuch problems are often sought to address and sometimes\nsimilar solutions hinted at [8]. It is also to be noted from\nthe figure that the enhancement of mobility is larger for\n\u2206F\nlarger \u2206F\nF0 . However, we restrict our attention to V0 k =\n0.01 and 0.02 which are relatively quite small compared\nto VF00k of our interest where we expect mobility enhancement.\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\u2206F = 0\n\n1\n\nF0 = .06\nF0 = .08\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nF0 = .10\n\n0.8\n\nF0 = .11\n\n0.6\n\nF0 = .14\n\nF0 = .14\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\nF\n\nFIG. 3. \u03b30 \u03bc is plotted as a function of F0 (solid curve).\nThe hysteresis curves are for various constant values of F0\nand \u2206F = .02 with period of modulation T\u03a9 = 2000.

As can be seen from\nthe figure the enhancement occurs where the curvature\nof the \u03b30 \u03bc-F0 plot is concave upward. And this happens\nat lower values of F0 . At low values of F0 , during the\npositive half cycle of the modulating field F (t) the system samples more higher velocities than it samples lower\nvalues during the negative half cycle resulting in a positive gain in the average mobility. The situation is just\nthe reverse for higher values of F0 . The explanation is\nsupported by the shapes of the hysteresis loops (Fig. 3)\nobtained because of modulation. As can be seen from the\nfigure, for example, the hysteresis loop for F0 = 0.8V0 k\nis more oval upward right whereas for F0 = 0.11V0 k the\nloop is more oval downward left. However, the shapes of\nthe loops themselves are determined by the distribution\nof intervals of locked and running states of the particles.\nAnd the distributions are sensitive to the values of F0 and\nother parameters such as the amplitude and frequency of\nmodulation, etc. The choice of frequency of modulation\nis very important for mobility enhancement.\n\n\u03b30 \u03bc\n\nthe Josephson junction equation except that one needs\nto replace \u03c6 by \u03c0/2 [2,4]. In our calculations we take\n\u03bb = 0.9 (incidentally, the choice happens to be in conformity with the experimental value [5]) and for comparison\n\u03bb = 0 (corresponding to uniform friction).\nWe solve the Langevin equation (1) (in fact, in its dimensionless form) numerically [6] to calculate the average\nmobility \u03bc (= limt\u2192\u221e ( x(t)\nt )/F0 ) as a function of F0 for\nvarious values of \u2206F and \u03a9 = T2\u03c0\u03a9 , T\u03a9 is the periodicity of the external field F (t).

(All quantities in\ndimensionless units)\n\nThe occurrence of the mobility enhancement can\nmainly be attributed to the nonlinear variation of \u03b30 \u03bc\n\nFigure 4 shows the variation of average mobility as\na function of frequency \u03a9(= 1/T\u03a9 ) of modulation. For\nlarge frequencies the mobility is small and close to the\nvalue for the one without modulation (shown by the\nhorizontal line in the figure). As the frequency is decreased the mobility increases, attains a maximum and\nthereafter tends to decrease. The maximum enhancement for \u2206F = 0.01V0 k is about 10 per cent whereas\nfor \u2206F = 0.02V0 k it is as large as about 70 per cent\nof the mobility obtained without modulation [9]. For\n\u2206F = 0.01V0 k the curve has a distinct peak. However, for \u2206F = 0.02V0 k the peak is not as clear. For\nsmall modulation, as the frequency goes toward zero\n(\u2206F 6= 0, \u03a9 \u2192 0) the mobility decreases and tends to\nbecome closer to the one corresponding to without modulation (\u2206F = 0). But for relatively large modulation\n\n\f3\n\nEnhancement of mobility by periodically modulating ...\n(e.g., \u2206F = 0.02V0 k, for F0 = 0.07V0 k) the same does\nnot seem to be true [10]. Therefore, for relatively small\namplitude modulation it is possible to maximize the enhancement of mobility by properly tuning the frequency\nof modulation. In the Josephson junction parlance it is\nreasonable to state that the sensitivity of ac SQUIDs can\nbe improved by properly choosing the amplitude and frequency of applied alternating current [11].\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b30 \u03bc\n\n0.175\n\n0.15\n\n0.125\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0.004\n\n(b)\n\n0.112\n\n\u03b30 \u03bc\n\n0.002\n\n0.108\n\n0.104\n\nPSfrag replacements\n0.1\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n\u03a9\n\nFIG. 4. \u03b30 \u03bc versus \u03a9, the frequency of modulation with\nF0 = .07 and (a) \u2206F = .02 and (b) \u2206F = .01. The horizontal line is drawn for reference corresponding to \u03b30 \u03bc for\n\u2206F = 0. (All quantities in dimensionless units.)\n\nIn the entire process of particle motion temperature\nplays a very important role. At zero temperature, for\nexample, once the particle gets trapped at any one of\nthe troughs of the potential, given the values of F0 and\nV0 considered, it will remain locked for ever making the\nparticle effectively immobile. It is the thermal fluctuations that release the particle from the locked states into\nthe running states [12]. As one can see from Fig. 1b of\nreference [1] that the mobility versus F0 curve (for small\nF0 ) changes very rapidly with temperature. Their curvatures at small F0 too differ. One would thus expect that\nmobility enhancement for given values of F0 , \u2206F and T\u03a9\nwill show a peaking behavior showing the phenomenon\nof stochastic resonance as a result of synchronization due\nto the interplay between external drive and thermally assisted running to locked transitions [13]. This aspect is\npresently being investigated.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nMCM thanks the Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar for\n\npartial support and hospitality.

However,\nsince t is very large one realization of the trajectory is\nassumed to be quite reasonable and adequate for calculating the average.\n[8] S. Granick, Physics Today 52, (July, 1999).\n[9] Mobilities on an overdamped potential system driven by\nadditive and multiplicative dichotomous correlated noises\nhave been investigated earlier. The constant tilt F0 required there were large, as they should be. There too\na similar situation was encountered when mobility remained large even when the relevant rate of dichotomous\nfluctuations was reduced to a small value. See Fig. 11\nof V. Berdechevsky and M. Gitterman, Phys. Rev. E56,\n6340 (1997).\n[10] For a reasonably good average of mobility one needs to\ncalculate x(t) for about 5000 cycles of modulations. For\nscaled T\u03a9 = 6000 the corresponding scaled times are typically of the order of 107 to 108 . The CPU time needed\nby a PII machine is more than 15 days. For larger values of T\u03a9 the averaging costs enormous computer time\nand is neither practical nor feasible, with facilities at our\ndisposal, to get results for smaller frequencies. And for\n\u2206F = 0.02V0 k to see the peak, if at all it has one, one\neither have to employ a better numerical method for the\nsolution or a faster machine.\n[11] If one chooses (see, for example, Josephson Effect Achievements and Trends, ed. by A. Barone, World\nScientific, 1986) a Josephson junction of capacitance\n0.5pF , and critical current 10\u22129 Coul.s\u22121 , the choice of\nF0 = 0.07V0 k corresponds to dc component of current\n= 7 \u00d7 10\u221211 Coul.s\u22121 and that of \u2206F = 0.01V0 k to\nthe modulating current amplitude of 1 \u00d7 10\u221211 Coul.s\u22121 .\nThe choice of \u03b30 = 0.035m.5 V0.5 k would correspond to\nthe resistance of the Josephson junction of about 23 kilo\nOhm and temperature T = 0.4V0 /kB to about 0.1K. It\n\n\f4\nturns out that the voltage measured across the junction\nwill peak at the modulating current frequency of about\n0.4 \u00d7 106 cycles s\u22121 .\n[12] H.
