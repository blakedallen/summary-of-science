Introduction\nWe will first briefly recall the rudiments of harmonic analysis on the\nSierpinski Gasket. ([1],[2],[3],[4])\nLet K be the Sierpinski Gasket (SG) constructed on the unit equilateral\ntriangle G0 with vertices {p0 , p1 , p2 } and Gm be the graph in the m th step\nas in the following figure.\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nMath Subject Classifications.

The function f \u2208 C(K), f : K \u2212\u2192 R is called harmonic on\nK if for every minimal triangle in Gm (m \u2265 1), with vertices {vi , vj , vk } the\nequalities\nf (vi ) + f (vj ) + f (vik ) + f (vjk ) \u2212 4f (vij ) = 0\n(1)\nhold, where vij is the midpoint of the segment [vi , vj ].\nLet\nf (p0 ) = \u03b1, f (p1 ) = \u03b2, f (p2 ) = \u03b3 .\n\n(2)\n\nThen this triple (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) completely defines a harmonic function f , that is,\nthere exists a unique harmonic function f : K \u2212\u2192 R such that f (p0 ) =\n\u03b1, f (p1 ) = \u03b2 and f (p2 ) = \u03b3. This harmonic function depends linearly on the\ntriple (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). According to the harmonic extension algorithm, it holds\n1\n1\n1\nf (p12 ) = (\u03b1+2\u03b2+2\u03b3), f (p02) = (2\u03b1+\u03b2+2\u03b3), f (p01) = (2\u03b1+2\u03b2+\u03b3). (3)\n5\n5\n5\nWe are interested in restrictions of the harmonic function f to the line segments contained in the SG. From (1)-(3) it can be seen that, if a nonconstant\nharmonic function is monotone on some line segment that is contained in SG,\nthen it is strictly monotone on it.\nLet Tm be a minimal triangle with vertices vi , vj and vk in Gm . The sides of\nTm can be ordered by the values |f (vi ) \u2212 f (vj )|.\n\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1 ([DSV]).\nLet f be a harmonic function on SG, E an edge in Gm with endpoints v0 , v1\nand midpoint v01 . Suppose\nf (v0 ) < f (v01 ) < f (v1 )\n\n(4)\n\n1\nf (v1 ) \u2212 f (v01 )\n\u2264\n\u2264 4.\n4\nf (v01 ) \u2212 f (v0 )\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\nThen the restriction of f to E is strictly increasing.\nTheorem 2 ([DSV]).\nThe restriction of f to the two largest edges of Tm is monotone. On the\nsmallest edge of Tm , the restriction of f might be monotone or not; but if it\nis not monotone, then it has a unique extremum.\n(We changed the wording of the Theorem 2 in [DSV] slightly.)\nIn this paper we will show that the sufficient conditions in Theorem 1 are\nalso necessary for the monotonicity of the restriction to an adge in Gm . Then\nwe will characterize when exactly simultaneous monotonicity of restrictions\nto all three edges of a triangle Tm in Gm occurs. Furthermore, we will prove\nthat at the junction points of any segment E in Gm , the derivatives of the\nrestriction of a harmonic function exist improperly (possibly with exception\nat a single point), and we will also prove that on another dense subset of E\nthe derivatives of the restriction are zero.\nNow we remark that it is enough to prove these statements for the triangle\nG0 instead of considering an arbitrary triangle Tm in Gm , because the procedure of harmonic extension is the same for G0 or Tm . In this spirit and for\nsimplicity we now reformulate the above two theorems of DSV (Dalrymple,\nStrichartz and Vinson):\nTheorem 1\u2032 .\nLet f be a harmonic function on SG and assume \u03b2 = f (p1 ) < \u03b3 = f (p2 ).\nLet p12 denote the midpoint of [p1 , p2 ]. Then, the restriction of f to the edge\n[p1 , p2 ] is strictly increasing, if the inequalities\n\n3\n\n\fi) \u03b2 < f (p12 ) < \u03b3\nii)\n\n1\n4\n\n\u2264\n\n\u03b3\u2212f (p12 )\nf (p12 )\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u22644\n\nare satisfied. (We remark that by harmonicity f (p12 ) =\n\n2\u03b2+2\u03b3+\u03b1\n)\n5\n\nTheorem 2\u2032 .\nOrder the edges of G0 by the values |f (p0 )\u2212f (p1 )| = |\u03b1\u2212\u03b2|, |f (p0)\u2212f (p2 )| =\n|\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3|, |f (p1) \u2212 f (p2 )| = |\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3|. Then the restrictions of f to the two largest\nof [p0 , p1 ], [p0 , p2 ] and [p1 , p2 ] are monotone. On the smallest edge, the restriction of f might be monotone or not; but if it is not monotone, then it has a\nunique extremum.\nBefore proceeding further, we will recast the inequalities i) and ii) of Theorem 1\u2032 in a more sympatetic form:\nLemma 1.\nThe DSV inequalities\ni) \u03b2 < f (p12 ) < \u03b3\nii)\n\n1\n4\n\n\u2264\n\n\u03b3\u2212f (p12 )\nf (p12 )\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u22644\n\nare equivalent to the inequalities\niii) \u03b2 < \u03b3,\n\n2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2 .\n\n(Proof is straightforward. )\n2. Characterization of the Monotonicity of the Restrictions\nConsider the side [p1 , p2 ] = [0, 1] of G0 and the restriction of the harmonic function f defined by (2) to [p1 , p2 ]. The following lemma can be\nproved by induction on m.\nLemma 2.\nLet lm = 12 \u2212\n\n1\n,\n2m+1\n\nrm =\n\n1\n2\n\n+\n\n1\n2m+1\n\n(m = 1, 2, 3, ...). Then\n\n4\n\n\ff(\n\n1\n3m \u2212 1\n3 m\n3m + 1\n)\n=\n\u03b1\n+\n[1\n\u2212\n(\n)\n]\u03b2\n+\n\u03b3\n2m\n2 * 5m\n5\n2 * 5m\n\nf (1 \u2212\n\n1\n3m \u2212 1\n3 m\n3m + 1\n)\n=\n\u03b1\n+\n[1\n\u2212\n(\n)\n]\u03b3\n+\n\u03b2\n2m\n2 * 5m\n5\n2 * 5m\n\n(7)\n\n3m+1 + 4 * 5m + 3\n4 * 5m \u2212 3m+1 \u2212 1\n5m \u2212 1\n\u03b1\n+\n\u03b2\n+\n\u03b3\n5m+1\n10 * 5m\n10 * 5m\n\n(8)\n\n3m+1 + 4 * 5m + 3\n4 * 5m \u2212 3 * 3m+1 \u2212 1\n5m \u2212 1\n\u03b1\n+\n\u03b3\n+\n\u03b3\n5m+1\n10 * 5m\n10 * 5m\n\n(9)\n\nf (lm ) =\n\nf (rm ) =\n\n(6)\n\n(Actually, by symmetry, one of these equalities implies the other three).\nTheorem 3.\nLet f be the harmonic function on SG generated by the triple (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). Then\nthe restriction of f to [p1 , p2 ] is strictly increasing if and only if \u03b2 < \u03b3 and\n2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2.\nRemark 1. This fact can also be expressed as follows: the restriction of a\nnonconstant f to [p1 , p2 ] is strictly monotone iff \u03b1 lies between 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 and\n2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2, because for a nonconstant f , necessarily \u03b2 6= \u03b3 : if we had \u03b2 = \u03b3,\nthen \u03b1 lying between 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 and 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2 would coincide with \u03b2 and \u03b3 making\nthe function constant.\nRemark 2. The condition \"\u03b1 lies between 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 and 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\" can also be\nexpressed as follows: Let \u03b4 = \u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b3. Then 2\u03b2\u2212\u03b3 \u2212\u03b1 = 3\u03b2\u2212\u03b4, 2\u03b3 \u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 =\n3\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4 and the condition takes the form (3\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4)(3\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4) \u2264 0.\nProof of Theorem 3. If \u03b2 < \u03b3 and 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2, then by Lemma\n1, the DSV inequalities are satisfied, and consequently the restriction of f\nto [p1 , p2 ] is strictly increasing by Theorem 1\u2032 . Now we show the necessity of\nthe inequalities \u03b2 < \u03b3 and 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2. The inequality \u03b2 < \u03b3 is obvious.

By Theorem 3 and the Remarks 1 and 2, the restriction of f to all\nthree edges of SG are simultaneously strictly monotone if and only if all of\nthe following three inequalities are satisfied:\n\n(3\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4)(3\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4) \u2264 0\n(3\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4)(3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4) \u2264 0\n(3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)(3\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4) \u2264 0.\n6\n\n\fThese three inequalities can only be satisfied if at least one of the numbers\n3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, 3\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4 or 3\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4 vanishes. This is also sufficient as easily can be seen.\nFor example, let 3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 = 0. Then the second and third inequalities are\nobviously satisfied and the first is also true, because then 2\u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b3 and\nthis means that \u03b1 = 12 [(2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3) + (2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2)] and this is enough for the first\ninequality to be satisfied \u2737\nRemark 3. Interestingly, the equations 2\u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b3, 2\u03b2 = \u03b1 + \u03b3, 2\u03b3 = \u03b1 + \u03b2\nare equivalent to the vanishing of the normal derivatives at the vertices.\n[BST]\nRemark 4. We can express the content of Theorem 4 also in terms of side\nlengths of G0 (with respect to f ) : By definition, the lengths of the edges of\nSG are |\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2|, |\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3|, |\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3|. By Theorem 2 ([DSV]) we know that the\nrestriction of f to the two largest edges are monotone. After having characterized simultaneous strictly monotonicity on all three edges in Theorem 4,\nwe can say that this is exactly the case if and only if the G0 is isosceles, the\nthird side being the largest: For example, if 2\u03b1 = \u03b2 +\u03b3, then |\u03b1\u2212\u03b2| = |\u03b1\u2212\u03b3|\nand |\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3| = 2|\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2| > |\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2|. In other words, a non-monotone restriction\noccurs, iff the length of the smallest edge is strictly less than the lengths of\nthe other two edges. So, there are two cases for non-monotonicity: Either\nG0 is scalene, or , if it is isosceles, then the length of the third side is strictly\nless than the others. In the latter case, the third side of the isosceles must\nhave necessarily side length zero. (See Fig. 2)\n3. Derivatives of Restrictions at the Junction Points\nWe will show in this section that the derivatives of the restriction of a\nharmonic function on SG to any segment in SG exist and are infinite at all\njunction points with possibly a single exception. It is again enough to show\nthis for the edges of G0 by general reasons we indicated in the introduction.\nWe first need the following\nLemma 3.\nLet the function g : [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 R be strictly monotone in a neighborhood of\nx0 \u2208 [0, 1], d \u2208 (0, 1), a 6= 0 and xm = x0 + adm . Assume\n\n7\n\n\fIsosceles with 2:\nall restrictions monotone\n\nIsosceles with :\nnon-monotone on the basis\n\nScalene :\nnon-monotone on the smallest side,\nmonotone on the other two sides\n\nFigure 2: Monotonicity classification with respect to side-lengths of G0\n\ng(xm ) \u2212 g(x0 )\nxm \u2212 x0\nis defined and tends to 0 (or \u00b1\u221e) as m \u2212\u2192 \u221e. If a < 0 then the left derivative of g at x0 exists and is 0 (or \u00b1\u221e); If a > 0 then the right derivative of\ng at x0 exists and is 0 (or \u00b1\u221e).\nProof. We consider only the case, where g is monotone increasing and a > 0.\nLet x0 \u2208 [0, 1) and x > x0 . Then there exists m \u2208 N such that\nx0 + adm+1 \u2264 x \u2264 x0 + adm\n\nAs x tends to x0 , m tends to infinity and from the inequalities\n8\n\n\fd.\n\ng(xm+1 ) \u2212 g(x0 )\ng(x) \u2212 g(x0 )\n1 g(xm ) \u2212 g(x0 )\n\u2264\n\u2264 .\nxm+1 \u2212 x0\nx \u2212 x0\nd\nxm \u2212 x0\n\nwe get the result \u2737\n\nRemark 5. In the above lemma, one-sided monotonicity is obviously enough\nfor one-sided derivative calculations.\nNow we will compute the derivative of the restriction at the point p = 1/2,\nfor monotone restrictions.\nLemma 4.\nLet the restriction of the harmonic function f to the edge [p1 , p2 ] = [0, 1]\nbe strictly monotone. Then f \u2032 ( 21 ) = +\u221e for f monotone increasing and\nf \u2032 ( 21 ) = \u2212\u221e for f monotone decreasing.\nProof. We give the proof for f monotone increasing:\nApplying (8) and Lemma 1, where x0 = 12 , a = \u2212 12 , d = 12 , we obtain\nf (lm ) \u2212 f ( 21 )\n3 6\nlim\n= lim ( ).( )m (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2) = +\u221e.\n1\nm\u2212\u2192\u221e\nm\u2212\u2192\u221e\n5 5\nlm \u2212 2\nThen by Lemma 3 the left-hand derivative at p = 21 is +\u221e. Analogously,\nusing (9), we obtain that the right-hand derivative at p = 12 is also +\u221e \u2737\nApplying Lemma 4 to smaller triangles, we see that the derivatives exist\nimproperly at all inner junction points of [p1 , p2 ] in whose vicinity the restriction is strictly monotone. Using Lemma 3 and Lemma 2, (6) and (7),\nwe can compute the derivatives at p1 and p2 also.\nLemma 5.\nIf 2\u03b2 = \u03b1 + \u03b3, then the derivative of the restriction of f to [p1 , p2 ] at p1 is\nzero; otherwise infinite. Similarly, if 2\u03b3 = \u03b1 + \u03b2, then the derivative of the\nrestriction at p2 is zero, otherwise infinite.\n(This result is implicit in Theorem 4 of [DSV]).\nLemma 4 and 5 yield to\n\n9\n\n\fLemma 6.\nLet f be a non-constant harmonic function on SG. Then the derivatives of the\nrestriction of f to [p1 , p2 ] exist improperly at all junction points on [p1 , p2 ],\nwith possibly a single exception. Moreover, this is true for the whole contour\nG0 = [p0 , p1 ] \u222a [p0 , p2 ] \u222a [p1 , p2 ], i.e. the derivative of the restrictions can\nvanish only for a single junction point on the whole contour and is infinite\nfor all the junction points.\nThe derivatives of the restriction are related to normal derivatives (For\nnormal derivatives see [BST]). It can be seen from the work of [BST] using monotonicity of restrictions of a harmonic function f on SG, that if the\nnormal derivative at a junction point vanishes, then the derivative of the\nrestriction to a segment containing the junction point also vanishes at that\njunction point. But we have seen above, that at junction points on the contour G0 the derivative is infinite with possibly a single exception. This proves\nthat the normal derivative is nonzero for all junction points on the contour\nG0 with at most a single exception for a non-constant f .\nRemark 6. It can be shown that, if the numbers \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 (being not all equal)\nare linearly independent over the field of rational numbers, then the normal\nderivative of the harmonic function on SG determined by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 is never zero\non any junction point on SG. More strictly, if there does not exist a relation\nn\u03b1 + m\u03b2 + k\u03b3 = 0\nbetween \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 (being not all equal) with n, m, k integers and n + m + k = 0,\nthen the normal derivative is never zero on any junction point on SG.\nSummarizing the above considerations, we obtain\nTheorem 5.\nThe normal derivative of a non-constant harmonic function f on SG is nonzero at all junction points on G0 \u2282 SG, with at most a single exception. This\nexception occurs at a vertex of G0 , iff all restrictions of f to the edges of G0\nare monotone.\n4. Zero Derivatives\nIn this section we will show that the derivative of the restriction of a harmonic function f on SG to an edge of any Gm is differentiable at a point\n10\n\n\fdividing the edge in ratio 1:3 and the derivative there vanishes. It is again\nenough to show this for the edge [p1 , p2 ] = [0, 1] of G0 as the extention rule\nfor the harmonic function is the same at every scale.\nTheorem 6.\nLet f be a harmonic function on SG and p the point dividing the edge [p1 , p2 ]\nin ratio 1:3. (i.e. p = 1/3). Then\n1\n(f |[0,1] )\u2032 ( ) = 0.\n3\nProof. Let us first assume that the restriction of f to [0, 1] is monotone\nincreasing. To approach the point p = 31 from left and right with geometrically convergent sequences we use the following sequence of triangles\nm m\n\u25b3m = {pm\n0 , p1 , p2 }:\nLet \u25b30 = G0 = {p0 , p1 , p2 } and let \u25b3m be defined as in Fig 3.
