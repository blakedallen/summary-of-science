Introduction\nIt is well known that some nonlinear equations have the soliton solutions [1], while all\nnonlinear equations have the chaos solutions. The soliton and chaos possess many different\ncharacteristic: a soliton has the same shapes and velocities in a travelling process and even if\nthrough a collision, it has a definite trace which is analogous to a classical particle; the chaos is a\nuniversal phenomenon for various nonlinear systems, it describes an order and intrinsic stochastic\nmotion which appears to be irregular and confused. Therefore, they form usually two remarkable\naspects, respectively. But the both relations are being noticed increasingly. Abdullaev\nsummarized the dynamical chaos of solitons and breathers for the sine-Gordon equation, the\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation and the Toda chain, etc[2]. Recently, some discussed the relations\namong chaos and the KdV equation [3], the perturbed sine-Gordon equation [4], the complex\nGinzburg-Landau equation [5], which have the soliton solution. Warbos has even suggested an\nidea: chaotic solitons (chaoitons) in the conservative systems [6].\nWe proved that some equations have soliton solutions and chaos solutions, and their\nconditions are different [7]. The possible meanings of the double solutions are discussed here.\n2.

It has the soliton solution\n\n2\n\ntg 1 [exp(\n\nx ut\n1 u2\n\n)] .\n\n(35)\n\nOnly some chaos equations have the soliton solutions.\n4.Discussion\nFurther, we discuss some possible meanings of the double solutions possessed by these\nequations briefly.\nIn the mathematical aspect, when some parameters are a certain constant, the soliton is\nderived; while these parameters vary in a certain region, the bifurcation-chaos appears. Therefore,\n4\n\n\fthe former corresponds to a stable state, and the latter is a changeable process.\nIn the physical aspect, Szebehely and McKenzie discussed that the three-body problem in\ngravitational field possesses chaotic behaviors [12]. We proved that the gravitational wave is a\ntype of nonlinear wave, and should be different to electromagnetic wave and have new\ncharacteristics, for example, as solitons [13]. Perhaps, the double solutions are two different states.\nThese parameters are the order parameters. These states often depend on the integral constants,\nthe boundary conditions and the initial conditions. It explains again that the solutions of the\nnonlinear equations depend on the initial values sensitively. It connects the chaos control by a\nmethod of parameter-control. When we control the order parameter in the nonlinear system, chaos\nappear, disappear, synchronize [14], even a determinational soliton is produced, for different\nparameteric values. For example, the soliton can be derived in a propagation of shallow water\nwaves, but if the flow rate reaches a certain value, there will form the turbulence. Moreover, the\nsoliton solution corresponds to particle even it may be a degenerate doublet with Fermi number\n(1 / 2) [7,8]. The chaos solution seems to correspond to the field, including the stochastic field.\nIt will probably connect the double solution theory of the de Broglie-Bohm nonlinear wave\nmechanics. In this case the wave-particle duality is a wave-particle synthesis, where the particle is\ndescribed by the mobile singularity of soliton of the wave equation [15].\nThe double solutions show a simultaneous existence on determinism and probabilism\nquantitatively from an aspect in some nonlinear systems.\nThe soliton equations and the chaos equations have the widely applied domains, in which\nabove double solutions will show many meaning results or a good deal of enlightenment.\nReferences\n1.A.C.Scott,et al., Proc.of IEEE.61,1443(1973).\n2.F.Kh.Abdullaev, Phys.Rep.179,1(1989).\n3.Yu.N.Zaiko, Sov.Tech.Phys.Lett.18,787(1992).\n4.G.Filatrella,et al., Phys.Lett.A178,81(1993).\n5.S.Popp,et al., Phys.Rev.Lett.70,3880(1993).\n6.P.J.Werbos, Chaos, Soliton, Fractals,3,321(1993).\n7.Yi-Fang Chang, Journal of Yunnan University. 26,338(2004).\n8.R.Jackiw and C.Rebbi, Phys.Rev.D13,3398(1976).\n9.R.Jackiw and J.R.Schrieffer, Nucl.Phys.B190,253(1981).\n10.H.Grosse, Phys.Rep.134,297(1986).\n11.W.Heisenberg, Rev.Mod.Phys.29,269(1957).\n12.V.Szebehely & R.McKenzie, Celestial Mech. 23,131(1981).\n13.Yi-Fang Chang, Apeiron, 3,30(1996).\n14.C.K.Duan, S.S.Yang, Wanli Min, et al., Chaos,Soliton,Fractals. 9,921(1998).\n15.L.de Broglie, Non-linear Wave Mechanics.
