In recent years, this holographic\ncorrespondence has been applied extensively to describe phase transitions in high Tc superconductors. The model consists of a system with a AdS black hole and a charged\nscalar field minimally coupled to an abelian gauge field. The black hole admits scalar hair\nat a temperature T below a certain critical temperature Tc by the mechanism of breaking\nof a local U (1) symmetry near the event horizon of the black hole [5]-[9]. The emergence\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nsunandan.gangopadhyay@gmail.com, sunandan@bose.res.in\ndibakar@bose.res.in\n\n1\n\n\fof a hairy AdS black hole implies the formation of a charged scalar condensate in the dual\nCFTs by the AdS/CFT correspondence.\nTill date a number of attempts have been made (mostly performed numerically) inorder to understand various properties of holographic superconductors in the framework\nof usual Maxwell electromagnetic theory [10]-[23]. Recently, some investigations have\nalso been performed in the framework of non-linear electrodynamics [24]-[28]. The first\nanalytic computation of the effects of Born Infeld (BI) electrodynamics on s-wave superconductors has been put forward by us [29] based on the Sturm-Liouville (SL) eigenvalue\nproblem. In this paper, we present analytical studies of Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductors in BI electrodynamics upto first order in the Gauss-Bonnet and BI coupling\nparameter in the probe limit. This means that we study the effect of the leading possible\nhigher derivative corrections to the onset of s-wave order parameter condensation.\nThe physical meaning of looking at the leading order corrections of the BI coupling\nparameter is that we are studying the effects due to higher derivative corrections of gauge\nfields on the s-wave order parameter condensation. On the other hand, the study of the\neffects of the curvature corrections on (3 + 1)-dimensional holographic superconductors is\nmotivated by the application of the Mermin-Wagner theorem (which forbids continuous\nsymmetry breaking in (2+1)-dimensions because of large fluctuations in lower dimensions)\nto the holographic superconductors [12]. The physical meaning of looking at the leading\norder corrections of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter is that we are studying the\neffects due to higher derivative corrections of curvature on the s-wave order parameter\ncondensation.\nOur results are in good agreement with the numerical computations carried out by us.\nWe feel that this study is worthwhile since very little has been done in problems involving\nnon-linear electrodynamics both analytically as well as numerically.\nBefore going further let us now mention about the organization of our paper. In section\n2 we give the basic setup for holographic superconductors in Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity.\nIn section 3 we explicitly compute the relationship between the critical temperature and\ncharge density. In section 4 we compute the condensation operator near the critical\ntemperature. Finally we draw our conclusion in section 5.\n\n2\n\nBasic set up for Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductors in Born Infeld electrodynamics\n\nWe perform our analysis in the fixed background of the Gauss-Bonnet AdS space time in\nthe probe limit. We begin with the action of the Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity in five\ndimensions, which is given by [15]\nZ\n\u221a\n12 \u03b1\n(1)\nS = d5 x \u2212g(R + 2 + (R2 \u2212 4R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd + R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 ))\nl\n2\nwhere 12\nstands for the cosmological constant and \u03b1 is the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient. At\nl2\nthis stage it is to be noted that for the rest of our analysis we set l = 1. The Ricci flat\nsolution for the action (1) is given by,\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 + f \u22121 (r)dr2 + r2 (dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 )\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere,\nr2\nf (r) =\n2\u03b1\n\ns\n1\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\u0013!\nM\n1 \u2212 4\u03b1 1 \u2212 4\n.\nr\n\n(3)\n\nHere M is the ADM mass of the black hole, which is related to the horizon radius (r+ )\n1\nas, r+ = M 4 . The Hawking temperature of the black hole is given by\nr+\nT =\n.\n(4)\n\u03c0\nIt is interesting to note that in the limit r \u2192 \u221e we have\n\u221a\n\u0003\nr2 \u0002\nf (r) \u223c\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 4\u03b1\n(5)\n2\u03b1\nwhich naturally sets an effective radius for the AdS space time as,\n2\u03b1\n\u221a\n.\n(6)\nL2ef f =\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 4\u03b1\nThe corresponding upper bound \u03b1 = 41 is known as Chern-Simons limit.\nIn order to study the s wave superconductors in the frame work of BI electrodynamics\nwe adopt the following Lagrangian density which includes the Maxwell field (A\u03bc ) and a\ncharged complex scalar field (\u03c8) as,\n!\nr\n1\nb \u03bc\u03bd\nL=\n1 \u2212 1 + F F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 |\u2207\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 iA\u03bc \u03c8|2 \u2212 m2 \u03c8 2\n(7)\nb\n2\nwhere b is the Born-Infeld parameter and m2 is the mass square of the scalar field.\nWith the following gauge choices for the vector field and the scalar field, [10]\nA\u03bc = (\u03c6(r), 0, 0, 0),\n\n\u03c8 = \u03c8(r)\n\n(8)\n\nwe eventually arrive at the following equations of motion for the scalar potential \u03c6(r) and\nthe scalar field \u03c8(r)\n2\u03c8 2 \u03c6\n3\n(1 \u2212 b(\u2202r \u03c6)2 )3/2 = 0\n\u2202r2 \u03c6 + (1 \u2212 b(\u2202r \u03c6)2 )\u2202r \u03c6 \u2212\nr\nf\n\n(9)\n\nand,\n\u0013\n\u03c62 \u03c8 m2 \u03c8\n3 \u2202r f\n+\n\u2202r \u03c8 + 2 \u2212\n= 0.\n(10)\n+\nr\nf\nf\nf\nIn order to solve (9) and (10) one needs the boundary conditions near the event horizon\nr \u223c r+ and at the spatial infinity r \u2192 \u221e.

Looking at the results enumerated in tables (1 and 2) it is indeed\nevident that for b = 0 case the results are in good agreement with the results existing in\nthe literature [12], [15]. Furthermore, we note that the condensation gets harder as the BI\ncoupling parameter (b) becomes larger. This result is consistent with the earlier findings\n[28]. Finally as an effect of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter (\u03b1) on the condensation\nvalue we note that, for a given value of b, the condensation is harder to form for the larger\nvalue of \u03b1 [12], [15],[22].

Following our methodology in [29],\nwe perform our analysis both analytically as well as numerically. Using Sturm-Liouville\n(SL) eigenvalue problem we establish the relationship between the critical temperature\nand the charge density. We show that both the values of BI coupling parameter (b) as\nwell GB coupling parameter (\u03b1) (at the leading order) indeed affects the formation of\nscalar hair at low temperatures. The physical meaning of the leading order expansions in\nb and \u03b1 is that what is being studied is the effect of leading higher derivative corrections\nof gauge fields and curvature to the onset of the s-wave order parameter condensation. It\nis observed that the condensation is harder to form for higher values of BI/GB coupling\nparameters. The critical exponent associated with the condensation again comes out to\nbe 1/2 which is in good agreement with the universal mean field value.\n\nAcknowledgments\nDR would like to thank CSIR for financial support.
