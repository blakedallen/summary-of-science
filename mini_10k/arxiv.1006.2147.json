The parent phases of these compounds generally show antiferromagnetic order that onsets between\n130 K and 200 K, with superconductivity emerging when\nthe antiferromagnetic order of the parent compounds is\nsuppressed [1\u20135]. This proximity of magnetic and superconducting order parameters is widely thought to be\na key argument for an unconventional pairing mechanism, likely mediated by spin fluctuations [6, 7] similar\nto the cuprates [8, 9]. But in strong contrast to the copper oxides, superconductivity in iron arsenides can be\ninduced without changing the carrier concentration, either by applying external pressure [10, 11] or by isovalent chemical substitution. The highest Tc achieved so\nfar in these materials is \u223c 55 K in SmO1\u2212x Fx FeAs [5]\nand (Sr,Ca)FeAsF [12, 13]. Oxygen-free FeAs-based compounds with the ThCr2 Si2 -type (122) structure also exhibit superconductivity induced by chemical substitution\nof alkali or transition metal ions [3, 14\u201316], the application of large pressures [11, 17\u201319], or lattice strain [20],\nwith transition temperatures as high as \u223c 37 K.\nFor the 122 phase, superconductivity has been induced\nby substituting Fe with not only 3d-transition metals\nsuch as Co and Ni, but also some of the 4d- and 5dtransition metals. Recently, Ru, Ir, and Pt substitution\nfor Fe were also shown to induce superconductivity in\nSrFe2 As2 and BaFe2 As2 [21\u201323]. Superconductivity with\nTc \u223c 31 K has also been shown to occur by isovalent substitution of P for As [24]. This gives the opportunity\nto tune magnetic character without nominally changing\ncharge carrier concentrations, for instance making the interpretation of transport coefficients much simpler than\nin the case of charge doping.\nIn order to investigate the possibility of applying uniform chemical pressure in a continuous manner, we have\nsynthesized the series of solid solutions Ba1\u2212x Srx Fe2 As2\nand Sr1\u2212x Cax Fe2 As2 by substituting isovalent alkaline\nearth atoms, and investigated the evolution of the crys-\n\ntal structure by high-resolution powder and single-crystal\nx-ray diffraction. Here we present our preliminary results\nthat suggest the unit cell of the Ba-Sr-Ca substitution series experiences a monotonic uniform chemical pressure\nas a function of alkaline earth atomic radius.\nSingle-crystal samples of Ba1\u2212x Srx Fe2 As2 and\nSr1\u2212x Cax Fe2 As2 were grown using the FeAs self-flux\nmethod [20]. Fe was first separately pre-reacted with\nAs via solid-state reaction of Fe (99.999%) powder\nwith As (99.99%) powders in a quartz tube of partial\natmospheric pressure of Ar. The precursor materials\nwere mixed with elemental Sr (99.95%) with either Ba\n(99.95%) or Ca (99.95%) in the ratio 4:1\u2212x : x, placed\nin an alumina crucible and sealed in a quartz tube under\npartial Ar pressure. The mixture was heated to 1150\u25e6C,\nslow-cooled to a lower temperature and then quenched\nto room temperature. Typical dimensions of as-grown\nsingle crystal specimen are \u223c100 \u03bcm thickness and\nup to 5 mm width. Chemical analysis was performed\nusing both energy- and wavelength-dispersive x-ray\nspectroscopy (EDS and WDS).\nBoth EDS and WDS analysis of all Ba1\u2212x Srx Fe2 As2\nand Sr1\u2212x Cax Fe2 As2 samples showed the proper 1:2:2\nstoichiometry in all specimens reported herein, with\nno indication of impurity phases.\nFigure 1 compares the nominal alkaline earth concentration x in\nSr1\u2212x Cax Fe2 As2 crystals with that measured by WDS\nand EDS analysis, using an average value determined\nfrom 8 different spots on each specimen. As shown by\nthe dotted line guide, the actual concentrations found by\nWDS are equal to the nominal values of x to within experimental error, indicating homogeneous substitution in\nthis series of solid solutions.\nDiffraction patterns were obtained by both powder\nand single-crystal x-ray diffraction and Rietfeld refinement (SHELXS-97) to I4/mmm structure. Powder x-ray\ndiffraction was performed at 250 K using a Smart Apex2\ndiffractometer with Mo-K\u03b1 radiation and a graphite\nmonochromator.

A Bruker Smart Apex2 diffractometer with Mo-K\u03b1 radiation, a graphite monochromator\nwith monocarp collimator, and a CCD area detector\nwere used for this experiment. The structure was refined\nwith SHELXL-97 software using 1033 measured reflections of which 115 were unique and 108 observed.

Sr and Ca\natoms were found to reside in the same site with a refined\nCa:Sr ratio of 0.33(1):0.67(1), giving the exact formula\nSr0.33 Ca0.67 Fe2 As2 from x-ray analysis.\nFigure 3 shows the unit cell of Sr0.33 Ca0.67 Fe2 As2 determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction at 250 K.

On the other hand, substitution of arsenic for the smaller phosphorus atoms, also instituting\na chemical pressure effect, induces superconductivity in\nBaFe2 As2\u2212x Px [25]. Thus, a pressure-volume effect is\nclearly an oversimplified explanation for superconductivity in BaFe2 As2\u2212x Px . In the future, it will be interesting\nto investigate the evolution of superconductivity combining both the chemical pressure effect of alkaline earth\nsubstitution studied here and another tuning parameter\nthat induces superconductivity in order to investigate the\nrole of lattice density in these phenomena.\nIn summary, we have systematically studied the\ncrystallographic properties in the solid solution series\nBa1\u2212x Srx Fe2 As2 and Sr1\u2212x Cax Fe2 As2 by growing high-\n\nFIG. 4: Upper panel: Variation of the a- and c-axis lattice\nconstants as a function of alkaline earth substitution in the\nseries Ba1\u2212x Srx Fe2 As2 (left half) and Sr1\u2212x Cax Fe2 As2 (right\nhalf) as determined from single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements at 250 K of single-crystal samples.

In both panels, solid symbols indicate data acquired\nusing single-crystal specimens and open symbols represent\ndata determined by powder x-ray diffraction.\n\nquality single crystals by the self-flux method. X-ray\ndiffraction and data refinement reveal that the entire\n(Ba,Sr,Ca)Fe2 As2 series progresses according to Vegard's\nlaw, experiencing a uniform chemical pressure effect due\nto substitution with reduced ionic size from Ba to Sr to\nCa, respectively.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge B.
