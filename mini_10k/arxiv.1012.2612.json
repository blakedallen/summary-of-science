Furthermore, QD emitters can be\ndriven electrically rather than optically, and therefore\nhave many advantages in device applications [4]. However, it is still a big challenge in the generation of highquality entangled photon pairs from QDs.\nThe key issue here is to suppress the fine structure\nsplitting (FSS) [Fig. 1 (a)] of the monoexciton, which\narises from the underlying asymmetry of the QDs. There\nhave been many attempts to reduce the FSS in QDs, including thermal annealing [1, 5], choosing proper dot matrix materials [6], and growing the dots in high symmetry\ndirections [7]. However, these methods can only reduce\nthe FSS to the level of about 10 \u03bceV, which might still\nbe too large to produce high-quality entangled photon\npairs. It has been shown that the FSS can be effectively\ntuned by an external magnetic field [1] and electric field\n[8, 9]. Perhaps a more convenient way to tune the FSS\nin a QD is via uniaxial stresses [10]. Singh et al [11]\nshowed that the FSS can be tuned to zero under uniaxial\nstress for an ideal QDs with C2v symmetry. However, for\na general QD, which has C1 symmetry, there is a lower\nbound for the FSS when an external stress is applied. It\nwas unclear which or what kind of QDs may have the\nsmallest FSS lower bound under stress. Therefore, it is\nstill an open question in selecting QDs that are suitable\nfor entangled photon emitters.\nThe purpose of the letter is to establish a general relationship between the asymmetry in QDs, the exciton polarization angle and the FSS under uniaxial stress, therefore provides a useful guide in selecting QDs that have the\nsmallest FSS lower bounds for applications such as entangled photon emitters.

The black line\ncorresponds to H2v without spin-orbit coupling, the blue line\ncorresponds to H2v with spin-orbital coupling, and the red\ndotted line corresponds to C1 symmetry.\n\nor [100] directions have the smallest FSS under stress.\nThe critical stress can also be determined by monitoring\nthe change in the exciton polarization angle. The theory is further confirmed through an atomistic empirical\npseudopotential calculations for InAs/GaAs QDs.\nWe start from a general understanding of the relation\nbetween the QD symmetry and exciton polarization angles shown in Fig. 1(b). An ideal InAs/GaAs QD has C2v\nsymmetry. Without spin-orbit coupling, the two bright\nexciton states belong to two different irreducible representations |\u03932 i and |\u03934 i. The polarizations of the two\nbright states are along the [100] and [010] directions respectively. When the spin-orbital interaction is included,\nthe two bright states belong to irreducible representation |\u03932 i \u00b1 i|\u03934 i [12], therefore the polarizations of the\nemission lines should be exactly along the [110] and [11\u03040]\ndirections. For a general dot, the symmetry is further\nlowered to C1 owing to structural imperfections or alloy\nrandomness [13], the polarization angle will depart from\nthe [110] and [11\u03040] directions, i.e., \u03b8 6=0.\n\n\f2\nWhen uniaxial stress is applied, the exciton Hamiltonian can be written as,\nH(n, p) = H2v + V1 + Vs (n)p ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is the external stress direction, and p is the\nmagnitude of the stress. H2v represent the Hamiltonian of an idea QDs with C2v symmetry, whereas V1\nlower the dot symmetry to C1 , due to local structure\ndeformations, alloy distribution [13] and interfacial effects [14] etc. Vs (n)p is the potential change due to\nthe external stress. We neglect the higher-order O(p2 )\nterms. This is justified by atomistic pseudopotential calculations, which show that these terms are negligible up\nto 200 MPa. The eigenvectors of the two bright states\nof H2v are |3i = |\u03932 i + i|\u03934 i and |4i = |\u03932 i \u2212 i|\u03934 i,\nwith corresponding eigenvalues E3 and E4 , respectively.\nThe energy levels are schematically shown in Fig. 1(a)\nin solid lines. The difference \u2206 = |E3 \u2212 E4 | is the FSS.\nThe other two states |1i and |2i are optically dark, also\nshown in Fig. 1(a) in broken lines. In the absence of an\nin-plane magnetic field, the coupling between the dark\nstates and bright states is negligible. We therefore write\nthe Hamiltonian in the space spanned by the two bright\nstates,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0112 + \u03b4 + \u03b13 p\n\u03ba + \u03b2p\nH=\n,\n(2)\n\u03ba + \u03b2p\n\u0112 \u2212 \u03b4 + \u03b14 p\nwhere \u0112+\u03b4 = h3|H2v +V1 |3i, \u0112\u2212\u03b4 = h4|H2v +V1 |4i. \u03b1i =\nhi|Vs (n)|ii (i=3, 4), \u03ba = h3|V1 |4i and \u03b2 = h3|Vs (n)|4i.\nBecause the Hamiltonian has a time-reversal symmetry,\nall parameters can therefore be set to real values for simplicity. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian yields eigenvalues,\np\np\u03b3 \u00b1 4(\u03b2p + \u03ba)2 + (\u03b1p + 2\u03b4)2\n,\n(3)\nE\u00b1 = \u0112 +\n2\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 and \u03b3 = \u03b13 + \u03b14 .\nThe eigenvectors\nof the two states are |\u03c8\u00b1 i =\n\u221a\n\u22122\u03b4\u2212p\u03b1\u00b1\n\n4(\u03b2p+\u03ba)2 +(\u03b1p+2\u03b4)2\n\n\u2212\n|3i + |4i.

It is interesting to find that the\npolarization angle at the critical stress is independent of\n\u03b4 and \u03ba, but only on the ratio of \u03b2/\u03b1. Thus the values\nof \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03ba and \u03b4 can be uniquely determined using the\nrelationship between \u2206 and p, and the polarization angle\nat pc .\nFor a dot with C2v symmetry, the external stress along\nthe [110] and [11\u03040] directions would not change the symmetry of the dot. For a general dot, the symmetry of\nthe dot is lowered to C1 due to alloy distribution and\nstructural asymmetry [13, 14], which change little under external stress. Therefore, for stress along the [110]\nand [11\u03040] directions, we have \u03b2 \u22480. Another special case\narises when stress is applied along the [100] direction, for\nwhich we have \u03b1=0 by symmetry. The results for these\ntwo special cases are schematically shown in Fig. 2 (a),\n(b) respectively. In Fig. 2(a), the change in FSS with p\nis determined by |\u03b1|, and the lower bound is determined\nby 2|\u03ba| at pc = \u22122\u03b4/\u03b1. At p = pc , the polarizations are\nalong the [100] or [010] directions whereas far away from\npc , the polarizations are along the [110] or [11\u03040] directions. The results for \u03b1 = 0 shown in Fig. 2 (b) are\ntotally different. In this case, the change in FSS with\np is determined by 2|\u03b2|, and the lower bound is 2|\u03b4| at\npc = \u2212\u03ba/\u03b2. At p = pc , the polarization is along the\n[110] and [11\u03040] directions, whereas far away from pc , the\npolarization is rotated into the [100] and [010] directions.\nTherefore, the polarization angle of the emission lines can\nbe used to determine the critical point pc in experiments.\nThe above picture is also correct for QDs with C2v symmetry, where \u03ba = 0, and the results in Fig. 2 (a) are then\nreduced to the results presented in Ref. [11].\nThe theory also provides a simple way to determine the\nFSS lower bound of a QD before\u221aapplying the external\nstress. At p = 0, we have q\n\u22060 = 2 \u03b4 2 + \u03ba2 and polarization angle tan(\u03b8) = \u03ba\u03b4 \u00b1 1 + ( \u03ba\u03b4 )2 . It is easy to show\nthat \u03ba = \u2212\u22060 * sin(2\u03b8)/2 and \u03b4 = \u22060 * cos(2\u03b8)/2.

The exciton energies are then calculated via many-particle configuration interaction (CI)\nmethod [20], in which the exciton wavefunctions are expanded in Slater determinants constructed from all confined electron and hole single-particle states.\nThe change in FSS under external stress is purely an\natomistic effect, because the macroscopic shapes of the\n\nPc [110]\n\n90\n\n10\n60\n\nPc [100]\n\n180 (d) Lens x = 0.6\n150\n120\n\n10\n5\n0\n25 (e) Pyramid, x = 0.6\n20\n15\n\n90\n60\n\n180\n\n(f) Pyramid, x = 0.6\n\n150\n120\n\n10\n5\n\nby measuring the polarization angle and FSS at p=0, we\ncan uniquely determine the values of 2|\u03ba| and 2|\u03b4| which\nare the FSS lower bounds for the stress along the [110]\n([11\u03040]) and [100] directions. For entangled photon source\napplications, |\u03b4| or |\u03ba| need to be smaller than 1 \u03bceV.\nTherefore our results provide a useful guide in selecting\nQDs for entangled photon sources, i.e., one should pick\nQDs for which the polarization angle is as closely aligned\nas possible to the [110] or [100] direction.\nTo confirm the above analysis, we perform numerical calculations of the FSS and polarization angle of\nInAs/GaAs QDs using an empirical pseudopotential\nmethod [16, 17]. We model the InAs/GaAs QDs by embedding the InAs dots into a 60\u00d760\u00d760 8-atom GaAs supercell. To calculate the exciton energies and their FSS,\nwe first have to obtain the single-particle energy levels\nand wavefunctions by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 2\n(7)\n\u2212 \u2207 + Vps (r) \u03c8i (r) = \u01ebi \u03c8i (r) ,\n2\n\n120\n\n20\n\n0\n25 (c) Lens x = 0.6\n\n(b) Pure Lens\n\n150\n\nPolarization Angle (degree)\n\nn\n[110]\n[11\u03040]\n[100]\nLens (x = 0.6)\n[110]\nD=25, h=3.5\n[11\u03040]\n[100]\nPyramid (x=0.6) [110]\nD=25, h=3.5\n[11\u03040]\n[100]\nElongated (x=0.6) [110]\nD[11\u03040] =26,\n[11\u03040]\nD[110] =20, h=3.5 [100]\n\n40\n\nFSS (\u03bceV)\n\nQDs\nLens (x=0)\nD=20, h=3.5\n\n(a) Pure Lens\n\n50\n\n0\n25 (g) Elongated x = 0.6\n20\n\n90\n60\n\n200\n\n(h) Elongated x = 0.6\n\n150\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-100 -50\n0\n50 100\nExternal Stress (MPa)\n\n100\n50\n0\n-100 -50\n0\n50 100\nExternal Stress (MPa)\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Left panel: The FSS as a function of p\nfor (a) pure lens-shaped, (c) alloy lens-shaped, (e) alloy pyramidal and (g) alloy elongated InAs/GaAs QDs. Right panel:\nCorresponding exciton polarization angle as a function of p.\nThe open squares (circles) are the results for stress along the\n[110] ([100]) direction calculated from the atomistic pseudopotential method, whereas the solid lines are the results of the\ntheory. Solid squares and circles indicate critical stresses.\n\ndots change little (less than 0.1%) under such stresses and\nshould not affect the FSS. Furthermore, we find that including piezoelectricity or not gives essentially the same\nresults, suggesting that piezoelectricity is not responsible for the FSS change. In fact, the change in FSS is\ndue to changes in the underlying atomic structure. We\nhave calculated the FSS of more than 13 dots under external stresses along the [110], [11\u03040] and [100] directions.\nThe behaviors of FSS are almost symmetric for stresses\nalong the [110] and [11\u03040] directions, i.e., the effects of\ntensile stress along the [110] direction is almost identical\nto the effects of compression along the [11\u03040] direction.\nThe results for some typical dots are shown in Fig. 3,\nwhereas the geometry and other parameters of these dots\nare listed in Table. I. In the left panels of Fig. 3, we plot\nthe FSS vs p along the [110] (black square) and [100] (red\ncircle) directions. The solid lines are fitted from theory\n\n\f4\nusing Eq. (4). The right panels show the corresponding polarization angle \u03b8 vs p where the solid lines are the\ntheoretical predictions using Eq. (6). We use \u03b2=0 (\u03b1=0)\nfor p along [110] ([100]) direction. As can be seen, the\nagreement between numerical calculations and theory is\nremarkable.\n(1) Pure InAs/GaAs QDs with C2v symmetry. In Fig.\n3 (a) we show the FSS vs p along different directions for\na pure lens-shaped QDs with base D =20 nm and height\nh=3.5 nm. When the stresses are directed along the [110]\nand [11\u03040] directions, the FSS can be tuned exactly to zero\n[11]. The polarization angle \u03b8 is constant (90\u25e6 ) below pc\n= 47 MPa and jump to 180\u25e6 after pc as shown in Fig.\n3 (b). However, if the stress is along the [100] direction,\nthe FSS can not be tuned to zero, in agreement with\nprevious results [11]. The polarization angle rotates following Eq. (6) as seen in Fig. 3 (b). At p = pc , the\npolarization angle is 90\u25e6 . We also calculate pure pyramidal and elongated QDs, which do not have macroscopic\ncylindrical symmetry but still retain C2v symmetry, and\nfind similar features.\n(2) Alloy In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs QDs with C1 symmetry.\nFor alloy dots, the symmetry is lowered to C1 . The FSS\nhas lower bound under the uniaxial stress [11], as shown\nin Fig. 3 (c) (e) and (g), for different dot geometries and\nsizes. The corresponding parameters are summarized in\nTable I. The stress dependence of the polarization angles\nis also in excellent agreement with theory as shown in Fig.\n3 (d), (f) and (h) for the three dots. All three dots have\npolarization angle \u03b8c =135\u25e6 at pc if the stress is along the\n[110] direction, and \u03b8c =90\u25e6 (or 0\u25e6 ) if the stress is along\nthe [100] direction, as predicted by the theory. Among\nthe three alloy dots, the lens-shaped QD [Fig. 3 (c)] has\nthe largest lower bounds \u223c 7 \u03bceV at pc \u223c 62 MPa along\nthe [100] direction. At p=0, the lens-shaped QD has \u03b8\n= 110\u25e6 , compared to \u03b8 = 103\u25e6 for the pyramidal dot\nand 169\u25e6 for the elongated dot. The polarization angle\nof the lens-shaped QD deviates from the [110] (or [11\u03040])\ndirection most, and hence has the largest FSS at pc , as\npredicted by the theory. We obtain similar results when\nthe stress in along the [100] direction.\nIn the calculations, we find that \u03b1 is not very sensitive\nto the QD shape, but changes with alloy compositions.\nFor example, for pure dots, |\u03b1| \u223c 0.2 - 0.4 \u03bceV/MPa for\np along the [110] direction, whereas for In composition\nx=0.6, |\u03b1| reduces to 0.1 - 0.2 \u03bceV/MPa. \u03b2 also has similar features (for p along the [100] direction), with |\u03b2| \u223c\n0.05 - 0.1 \u03bceV/MPa for pure dots, and |\u03b2| \u223c 0.04 - 0.05\n\u03bceV/MPa for alloy dots with x=0.6. We also calculate\nalloy dots of the same geometry but with different alloy\ndistributions [13] and find that the alloy distribution does\nnot significantly change the values of \u03b1 and \u03b2. In contrast, \u03b4, \u03ba, and the polarization angle \u03b8 at p=0, change\ndramatically from dot to dot, in agreement with recent\nexperiments [21]. However, in all cases, the behaviors of\nthe FSS and polarization angle under stress are in excel-\n\nlent agreement with our theoretical predictions.\nTo conclude, we have established a general relationship between the asymmetry in QDs, the exciton polarization angle, and the FSS under uniaxial stress. We\nshowed that the FSS lower bound under external stress\ncan be predicted by the polarization angle and FSS under\nzero stress. The critical stress can also be determined by\nmonitoring the change in exciton polarization angle. The\nwork therefore provides a useful guide in selecting QDs\nwith smallest FSS which is crucial for entangled photon\nsources applications.\nThe authors thank A. J.

There, the exciton FSS of InAs/GaAs\nQDs is tuned via an electric field along the [001] direction,\nwhich has the same symmetry as applying stress along\nthe [110] and [1-10] directions (i.e., the case of \u03b2=0).\nDetermining the degree of agreement between the present\ntheory and the experiment of Ref. 9 is a promising avenue\nfor future research.\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nElectronic address: helx@ustc.edu.cn\nR.
