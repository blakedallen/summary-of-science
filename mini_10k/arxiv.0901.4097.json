It was beautifully demonstrated theoretically2 and later verified in experiments3,4 that the unscreened Coulomb interactions drive the armchair nanotube into a Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase with exotic spin-charge separation. On the other hand, if the\nCoulomb interactions are screened so that only shortranged interactions remain, various instabilities set in5\nand the ground state phase diagram is rather rich.\nAs a carbon nanotube has only a few conducting channels, it is not obvious how the long-ranged Coulomb interactions can be screened. One proposal for the reduction\nof long-ranged Coulomb interactions is a thick arrangement of nanotubes in either array or rope form.6,7 Alternatively, one can make use of improving nanoscale technology and place a carbon nanotube close to a conducting plate.8,9 The induced image charges in the conducting plate will render the Coulomb interactions U shortranged such that U (x) \u223c 1/x3 at long distances. The\npossibility of realizing short-range interactions in carbon\nnanotubes motivated us to revisit their correlation effects.\nWhile most theoretical investigations concentrate on\nthe armchair nanotube because of its simplicity, it is often\nassumed that the low-energy physics should be the same\nfor metallic zigzag carbon nanotubes, since for both honeycomb lattices the low-energy physics originates from\nthe Dirac cones in the band structure. We looked into\nthis issue carefully and found that the effective lattice\nmodel of the zigzag nanotube differs from that of the\narmchair. Ignoring the interactions momentarily, by integrating out the gapped modes,10 the metallic zigzag\nnanotube is described by an effective two-chain system\n(shown in Fig. 1). Note that the interchain hopping is absent in this effective lattice model. As a consequence, the\n\na\n\ny\nx\n\nb\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Zigzag carbon nanotube and the effective two-chain model after integrating out the higher-energy\nmodes.\n\nFermi velocities remain degenerate when the nanotube is\ndoped away from half filling. It is important to emphasize that the Fermi velocities in the armchair nanotube\nare equal to each other only at half filling and become\ndifferent at finite doping. As we will explain later, the\ndegeneracy of the Fermi velocities in the zigzag carbon\nnanotube is crucially important for dynamical symmetry enlargement (DSE) at finite doping. In addition to\nthe subtle velocity degeneracy at finite doping, the differences between the zigzag and armchair nanotubes' effective lattice models become obvious when one tries to\nwrite the effective interactions. It turns out that, after\nintegrating out the gapped modes, the effective interactions for the zigzag are far more complicated that those\nfor the armchair.\nWe reanalyze the correlation effects in the effective\ntwo-leg lattice model with the one-loop renormalization group (RG) and the non-perturbative bosonization\ntechniques. Due to the spreading of the wave function, the effective interaction strength is reduced to\nUeff , Veff = U/Nx , V /Nx , where Nx is the number of unit\ncells around the circumference and U, V are the on-site\nand the nearest-neighbor repulsions. This reduction in\nthe effective interaction strength is crucially important\nas it allows the weak-coupling RG analysis to be valid\nprovided U/t <\n\u223c 2\u03c0Nx .\n\n\f2\nThe one-loop RG flows determine the instabilities which may then be analyzed by non-perturbative\nbosonization (and refermionization) in order to identify\ngaps in different charge and spin sectors. From this, not\nonly can the phase diagram be determined, but our numerical results also reveal dynamical symmetry enlargement (DSE) of low-energy excitations above the ground\nstate.11,12,13,14,15 For a truly weak interaction strength\nU/t < 0.5, DSE occurs and the system is described by\nthe Gross-Neveu model with an enlarged SO(6) symmetry. The exact solution gives eight-fold kink/antikink excitations in the low-energy limit. This differs from the\nusual behavior of two decoupled single chains which exhibit spin-charge separation but only have four-fold degenerate spinons. It is also not the same as the fully\ngapped two-chain systems, where spinons and holons are\nglued together by long-range gauge interactions, originating from various gaps in the charge and spin sectors.\nWe also numerically compute the anomalous scaling\nof the gap/coupling ratios associated with the enlarged\nSO(6) symmetry. For bare couplings with approximate\nSO(6) symmetry, previous analytic calculations based on\nperturbation theory predict a universal exponent of 1/2\nfor the scaling functions of the gap/coupling ratios. Surprisingly, not only do we verify the predicted exponent\nnumerically, we also find that the exponent is robust even\nfor large deviations in the bare couplings! Finally, for realistic material parameters U/t \u223c O(1), the charge sector decouples and ruins the SO(6) symmetry but there\nremains an enlarged SO(4) symmetry in the spin sector,\nindicating an unexpected degeneracy between the usual\nthree-fold magnons and an additional neutral particlehole excitation.\nThe rest of the paper is organized in the following way:\nIn Sec II, we derive the effective lattice model for the\nzigzag carbon nanotube at finite doping. By carefully\ntaking the underlying lattice structure into account, we\nwrite down the effective interactions for the on-site and\nnearest-neighbor repulsions. In Sec. III, we show how\nthe field theory description can be derived from the effective lattice model by chiral-field decomposition. Then,\nthe bare couplings in the field-theory limit can be determined from the effective lattice model. In Sec IV, the results of the one-loop RG are shown. From the bosonization technique, the phase diagram of the ground state\nis obtained. We also show how DSE emerges from the\nnumerics in weak coupling. In Sec. V, we consider the\nanomalous scaling behavior rising from the finite strength\nof interactions. Furthermore, we show that the enlarged\nSO(4) symmetry in the spin sector is robust as interactions increase. In the last section, we discuss the physical\nimplications and consequences of our results.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE LATTICE MODEL\n\nA carbon lattice may be represented by two\u221aregular\ntriangular sublattices, offset by d = a(0, \u22121/ 3) and\n\n\u221a\nwith basis vectors a\u00b1 = a(\u00b11/2, 3/2), where a is the\nlattice constant. The Hubbard hopping Hamiltonian of\nsuch a carbon lattice is\nX\u001a\nH0 =\n\u2212 t\u22a5 c\u20201\u03b1 (r)c2\u03b1 (r + d)\nr,\u03b1\n\n\u2212t c\u20201\u03b1 (r)c2\u03b1 (r + a+ + d)\n\u001b\n\u2212t c\u20201\u03b1 (r)c2\u03b1 (r + a\u2212 + d) + h.c.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the spatial summation goes over all lattice points\nr = n+ a+ +n\u2212 a\u2212 with integral n\u00b1 . The lattice operator\nci\u03b1 describes the destruction of a fermion with spin \u03b1 in\nthe i-th sublattice. The hopping amplitude along the\nvertical (i.e., y direction) bond is t\u22a5 and along the two\nzigzag bonds is t. However, in the following calculations,\nwe only consider isotropic hopping with t = t\u22a5 .\nThe Hamiltonian for the on-site interaction is\nX\nHU = U\nni\u2191 (r)ni\u2193 (r),\n(2)\nr,i\n\nwhere U is the on-site interaction strength and the electron density is defined by ni\u03b1 = c\u2020i\u03b1 ci\u03b1 . Similarly, the\nnearest-neighbour interaction Hamiltonian is\nX \u001a\nHV =\nV\u22a5 n1\u03b1 (r)n2\u03b2 (r + d)\nr,\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n+V n1\u03b1 (r)n2\u03b2 (r + a+ + d)\n\u001b\n+V n1\u03b1 (r)n2\u03b2 (r + a\u2212 + d)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere V\u22a5 is the nearest-neighbor interaction strength\nacross the vertical bond and V is the nearest-neighbor\ninteraction strength across the two zigzag bonds. In reality, we expect V, V\u22a5 < U .\nThe Hubbard model of the zigzag carbon nanotube\nmay be mapped onto a two-leg ladder.10 Here the y-axis\nis defined to be in the longitudinal direction of the nanotube and the x-axis is around the nanotube. Due to the\ntranslational invariance around the nanotube, advantage\nis taken of the fact that the momentum must be quantized in the x direction,\nkx =\n\n2\u03c0p\n,\naNx\n\np = 0, \u00b11, . . . , \u00b1(Nx /2).\n\n(4)\n\nThe significant momenta are those which coincide with\nthe Dirac points, i.e., the zeros of the energy spectrum.\nIn the weak coupling limit U \u001c t, t\u22a5 , it is natural to\nderive the effective model for the hopping first. Note that\nthe energy spectrum for two-dimensional graphene in the\ntight-binding limit is\n\u221a\n\nh(k) = 2t cos(kx a/2)eiky a/2\n\n3\n\n\u221a\n\n+ te\u2212iky a/\n\n3\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nTherefore, the Dirac points\nare given by k =\n\u221a\n(\u00b14\u03c0/3a, 0), (\u00b12\u03c0/3a, \u00b12\u03c0/ 3a). For a metallic carbon\n\n\f3\nnanotube, Nx = 3n and the quantized momenta cut\nthrough the Dirac points at kx = \u00b12\u03c0/3a. For the numerics in this paper, we choose Nx = 12 but the results\nhold for general metallic zigzag nanotubes.\nAfter a partial Fourier transformation in the x direction and integrating out the gapped modes, the lattice\noperator ci (r) is described by the fields at kx = \u00b12\u03c0/3a,\n1 X\nci (x, y) ' \u221a\ndqi (y)eiq(2\u03c0/3a)x .\n(6)\nNx q=\u00b1\nOn substitution of Eq. (6) into the hopping Hamiltonian,\nX \u2020\nH0 = \u2212t\n[dq1 (y)dq2 (y 0 )\ny,q=\u00b1\n\n+d\u2020q1 (y)dq2 (y 0\n\n\u2212 2b) + h.c.],\n(7)\n\u221a\nwhere the average lattice constant is b = a\u221a 3/4 with an\noffset between the two sublattices \u03b4 = a 3/12. That\nis to say, sublattice 1 consists of sites at y = 2mb and\nsublattice 2 at y 0 = y + b \u2212 \u03b4. This effective hopping\nHamiltonian describes a two leg ladder with no hopping\nacross the rungs as shown in Fig. 1. Since there is no\nhopping between the two legs, the Fermi velocities of the\ntwo bands remain degenerate even at finite doping. The\narmchair nanotube can also be captured by a similar (but\ndifferent) effective two-leg model, but in this case hopping\nbetween legs is permitted and the Fermi velocities will\nbecome different when doped away from half filling.\nNow let us turn to the derivation for the interacting\nHamiltonians. From Eq. (6), the effective Hamiltonian\nfrom on-site repulsion is\nU X\nHU =\n[nq1\u2191 (y)nq1\u2193 (y) + nq1\u2191 (y)nq\u03041\u2193 (y)\nNx y,q\n+d\u2020q1\u2191 (y)dq\u03041\u2191 (y)d\u2020q\u03041\u2193 (y)dq1\u2193 (y)]\nU X\n[nq2\u2191 (y 0 )nq2\u2193 (y 0 ) + nq2\u2191 (y 0 )nq\u03042\u2193 (y 0 )\n+\nNx y,q\n+d\u2020q2\u2191 (y 0 )dq\u03042\u2191 (y 0 )d\u2020q\u03042\u2193 (y 0 )dq2\u2193 (y 0 )],\n\n(8)\n\nwith nqi\u03b1 = d\u2020qi\u03b1 dqi\u03b1 and y 0 = y + b \u2212 \u03b4. The notation\nq\u0304 = \u2212q is introduced for simplicity. Note that the above\nHamiltonian contains not only the density-density interaction between the two legs q = \u00b1 but also the pair-pair\ninteraction between (q, q\u0304) singlets. Similarly, we can derive the effective Hamiltonian for the nearest-neighbor\nrepulsion,\n\u0014\n2V X X\nnp1\u03b1 (y)nq2\u03b2 (y 0 )\nHV =\nNx y,p,q,\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\u0015\n+ cos(2\u03c0/3)\u03b4pq\u0304 d\u2020p1\u03b1 (y)dq1\u03b1 (y)d\u2020q2\u03b2 (y 0 )dp2\u03b2 (y 0 )\n\u0014\nV\u22a5 X X\n+\nnp1\u03b1 (y)nq2\u03b2 (y 0 \u2212 2b)\nNx y,p,q\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\u0015\n\u2020\n\u2020\n0\n0\n+\u03b4pq\u0304 dp1\u03b1 (y)dq1\u03b1 (y)dq2\u03b2 (y \u2212 2b)dp2\u03b2 (y \u2212 2b) . (9)\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the factor cos(2\u03c0/3)\ncomes from the underlying honeycomb lattice after a partial Fourier transformation and can not be gauged away\nby shifting the second sublattice by \u03b4. Furthermore, since\nthe electrons are delocalized around the nanotube, both\nthe effective on-site and nearest-neightbor interactions\nare suppressed by 1/Nx .\nThe effective hopping Hamiltonian in Eq. (7) and the\ntwo interaction ones in Eqs. (8) and (9) now resemble an\neffective two-leg ladder. However, they are quite different\nfrom standard two-leg ladder Hamiltonians. The two-leg\nladder Hamiltonian usually describes hopping and nearest neighbour interactions both along legs and across\nrungs, with the rungs positioned at right angles to the\nlegs. However, in the zig-zag nanotube case the hopping\nonly occurs along legs, and not across rungs. In addition,\nthe effective interactions are far more complex than the\nordinary density-density interactions.\nIn particular, the inclusion of the next-nearest neighbor interaction really complicates the story since it reflects the underlying lattice structure. In fact, if one goes\nthrough the same mapping, it is straightforward to show\nthat the effective interactions of V and V\u22a5 for the zigzag\nand armchair nanotubes are different. On the other hand,\nthe effective interaction of U can be shown to be equivalent by a simple (but subtle) gauge transformation.\n\nIII.\n\nFIELD-THEORY LIMIT\n\nTo determine the ground state of the effective two-leg\nmodel, the combined usage of one-loop RG and bosonization is extremely powerful. In order to proceed, one needs\nto obtain a field theory description of the lattice model\nin the continuous limit. When considering weak interactions, a two-leg ladder is usually diagonalized so that\nthe hopping Hamiltonian is written in terms of two decoupled bands. However, in our case the two legs are\nalready decoupled in the hopping Hamiltonian, making\nany diagonalization unnecessary. In the low-energy limit,\nthe lattice operators may be linearized about the Fermi\npoints and expressed in terms of chiral fields. For the\nfirst sublattice, the chiral-field decomposition is rather\nstandard,\ndq1 (y) \u2248\n\n\u221a\n\nb\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c8Rq (y)eikF y + \u03c8Lq\u0304 (y)e\u2212ikF y . (10)\n\nFor the second sublattice, one may expect the finite offset\n\u03b4 should give rise to some phase factor in the chiral-field\ndecomposition. However, a careful analysis leads to a\nsomewhat surprising result,\n\u221a\n\n\u0014\ndq2 (y + b \u2212 \u03b4) \u2248 b \u03c8Rq (y + b)eikF (y+b)\n\u0015\n\u2212ikF (y+b)\n+ \u03c8Lq\u0304 (y + b)e\n.\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nThe above result states that the chiral-field decomposition is the same as when the finite offset \u03b4 is ignored.\nThe detailed derivation can be found in Appendix A.\nNow we are in a position to rewrite the effective two-leg\nmodel in terms of these chiral fields.

It is worth\nmentioning again that, due to the absence of the interchain hopping in the effective two-chain system, there is\nonly one Fermi velocity. The electron-electron interactions are written in terms of the SU(2) currents,\n1 \u2020\n\u03c8\n(y)\u03c8P q0 \u03b1 (y),\n2 P q\u03b1\n1\nJP qq0 (y) = \u03c8P\u2020 q\u03b1 (y)\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8P q0 \u03b2 (y).\n2\nJP qq0 (y) =\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nHere P = R, L denotes the chirality of the fields and \u03c3\nis the vector of Pauli matrices.\nMaking use of operator product expansions for the current products, one can derive the one-loop RG equations, dgi /dl = Ajk\ni gj gk , where gi are the couplings in\nEq. (13). For the effective two-chain system considered\nhere, we need four couplings for the Cooper scattering in\n\u03c1,\u03c3\n\u03c1,\u03c3\n\u03c1,\u03c3\nthe charge and spin sectors, c\u03c1,\u03c3\n11 (= c22 ) and c12 (= c21 ),\n\u03c1,\u03c3\n\u03c1,\u03c3\nand two forward scattering ones f12 (= f21 ). The coupled one-loop RG equations are too complicated to allow\nanalytic solutions except for some special cases. The bare\ncouplings gi (0), required for numerical integrations of RG\nflows, can be computed from the lattice interactions U ,\nV and V\u22a5 ,\nc\u03c111 = (U + 3V + 3V\u22a5 )/t0 c\u03c311 = (U + V \u2212 V\u22a5 )/t0 (16)\nc\u03c112 = (U + 3V\u22a5 )/t0 c\u03c312 = (U \u2212 2V \u2212 V\u22a5 )/t0 (17)\n\u03c1\n\u03c3\nf12\n= (U + 3V + 3V\u22a5 )/t0 f12\n= (U \u2212 2V \u2212 V\u22a5 )/t0 (18)\nwhere t0 = \u03c0Nx v/b = 2\u03c0Nx t. Because of the 1/Nx factor, the applicability of the \"weak-coupling\" regime is\nextended to U/t <\n\u223c 2\u03c0Nx . The values of t reported in the\nliterature16,17,18 range from 2.4-2.7 eV for CNTs, while\nt ' 3 eV is typical in graphites. Although an accurate\nvalue of U is not yet known in nanographite systems, the\nvalue for polyacetylene, U ' 6-10 eV,19,20 might serve as\na reasonable guess. Thus, we expect that U/t \u223c 2 \u2212 4\nin nanographite systems, which satisfies the criterion for\n\"weak coupling\".\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Phase diagram for doped zigzag carbon nanotube with different V\u22a5 /U and V /U .\n\nIV. DYNAMICAL SYMMETRY\nENLARGEMENT IN WEAK COUPLING\n\nTo determine the phase diagram of the ground states,\nwe first integrate the RG equations numerically up to the\ncutoff length scale, defined as when one of the relevant\ncouplings reaches unity, gi (lc ) = 1. With Nx = 12 and\nas long as U/t <\n\u223c 10, the couplings fall into two groups at\nl = lc : the relevant couplings reach order unity and the\nirrelevant ones remain much smaller than unity. However, the one-loop RG alone can only determine instabilities. To truly pin down the ground state, we need to\nemploy the non-perturbative bosonization and refermionization techniques. We follow the bosonization scheme\ndescribedP\nin Ref. 11. The kinetic part takes the form,\nv\n2\n2\nH0 = 8\u03c0\n\u03bc [(\u2202y \u03b8\u03bc ) + (\u2202y \u03c6\u03bc ) ], where \u03bc = \u03c1\u00b1, \u03c3\u00b1 denotes the total and relative charge and spin sectors respectively, with the conjugate bosonic fields \u03b8\u03bc and \u03c6\u03bc\ndescribing the displacement and phase fluctuations. The\ninteracting part can also be bosonized after dropping the\nirrelevant couplings in the RG flows. For instance, the\nbosonized interaction Hamiltonian of the d-wave superconductor phase in Fig. 2 is,\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nKi (\u2202y \u03b8i )2 \u2212 (\u2202y \u03c6i )2\n2\n32\u03c0 i=\u03c1+,1,2,3\nX\n\u2212\nBij cos \u03b8i cos \u03b8j ,\n(19)\n\nHI =\n\ni,j=1,2,3(i6=j)\n\nwhere (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 ) = (\u03c6\u03c1\u2212 , \u03b8\u03c3+ , \u03b8\u03c3\u2212 ). The coefficients in\n\u03c1\nfront of the gradient terms are K\u03c1+/1 = f12\n\u00b1c\u03c111 , K2/3 =\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u2212c11 \u2213f12 . The coefficients Bij are symmetric with B12 =\nc\u03c312 , B13 = (c\u03c312 + c\u03c112 )/2 and B23 = \u2212c\u03c311 .\nThe non-zero Bij pin the corresponding neutral boson fields in a consistent way and generate gaps in the\n\u03b81,2,3 sectors, while the total charge mode \u03b8\u03c1+ remains\ngapless (described by the Luttinger liquid) and is protected by translational invariance. With the specific\npinned values of \u03b81,2,3 , one can show that the ground\nstate exhibits quasi-long-range superconducting correlations with d-wave symmetry while all other correlation\n\n\f5\n2\n\nDij\n0.1\n\nCoupling\t\n Ratios\n\nF12rho / C11sigma\nC12rho / C11sigma\nC11rho / C11sigma\nF12sigma / C11sigma\nC12sigma / C11sigma\n\n0.01\n\n1.5\n\n1\nK1/B23\nB13/B23\nB12/B13\nK3/B23\nK2/B23\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1x10-3\n\n1x10-5\n\n1x10-4\n\n1x10-3\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nU/t\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Log-log plot for anomalous scaling of\nDij in weak coupling for U/t ranging from 10\u22125 to 1.

When V and V\u22a5 grow\nlarger, the ground state undergoes a quantum phase transition to the charge density wave (CDW) shown in Fig. 2.\nSince the effective Hamiltonian for the CDW is rather\nsimilar to that in Eq. (19), we will not give a detailed\nderivation here. Clearly, changing the interaction profile\nallows the system to be tuned through the dSC-to-CDW\nquantum phase transition.\nThe 1/Nx reduction of the effective interaction\nstrength gives some unexpected results. For simplicity,\nlet's start with the extremely small U/t = 10\u22123 without nearest-neighbor interactions. We choose the cutoff length scale to be |c\u03c311 (lc )| = 1. Remarkably, our\nnumerics show equality among all coefficients Ki and\nBij at the cutoff length scale. This beautiful equality\namong all coefficients signals an enlarged symmetry. In\nfact, following the refermionization scheme developed in\nR/L\nRef. 11, one can define six Majorana fermions \u03b7i\nwith\ni = 1, 2, ..., 6 to replace the three bosonic fields \u03b81,2,3 . In\nterms of these Majorana fermions, the neutral sectors of\nthe Hamiltonian density in Eq. (19) becomes the exactly\nsoluble Gross-Neveu model with the enlarged SO(6) symmetry,\nHN = g6\n\n6\nX\n\nL\nGR\nab Gab ,\n\n(20)\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n3\nInteraction\t\n Strength\t\n \t\n U/t\n\n4\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Coupling ratios of Ki and Bij at the\ncutoff length scale for the Nx = 12 doped zigzag carbon nanotube with different bare interaction strength. The three filled\nsymbols represent the relevant ratios related to the enlarged\nSO(4) symmetry in the spin sector.\n\nwhere Q\u03c3\u00b1 describes the total/relative z-component of\nthe spin between two chains and Q\u03c1\u2212 describes the\nrelative charge. The six fundamental fermions correspond to the usual three-fold degenerate magnons\nand three additional particle-hole bound states and\ncarry the quantum numbers (Q\u03c1\u2212 , Q\u03c3+ , Q\u03c3\u2212 ) =\n(\u00b11, 0, 0), (0, \u00b11, 0), (0, 0, \u00b11). The kinks/antikinks carry\nthe fractionalized quantum numbers (\u00b1 12 , \u00b1 12 , \u00b1 12 ). The\nkinks are defined to have an even number of positive\nquantum numbers, while the antikinks have an odd number of positive quantum numbers. Note that, since the total charge sector decouples, all the kinks are charge neutral and can be considered to be the generalized spinons\noriginally found in the single-chain system. However,\nthe charge and the spin sectors are not fully decoupled\nhere (as opposed to the single-chain system) because the\nkinks still carry definite Q\u03c1\u2212 = \u00b1 12 . This partial spincharge separation is reflected in the degeneracy of the\nspinon-like excitations. In the single-chain system there\nare two kink/antikink excitations, so one may expect the\ndegeneracy to double to four-fold in a two-chain system\nwith complete spin-charge separation. However, due to\nthe incomplete spin charge separation the degeneracy of\nthe kinks and antikinks in our two-chain system, and\nits equivalent zigzag nanotube, is eight-fold rather than\nfour-fold.\n\na,b=1\nP P\nwhere GP\nab = i\u03b7a \u03b7b are the generators of the SO(6) rotations. The excitation spectrum of the SO(6) phase from\nthe exact solution consists of two distinct features: eight\nkink/antikink excitations with mass \u221a\nmk , and six fundamental fermions with mass m1 = 2mk . Above the\nthreshold Ec = 2mk is the kink/antikink continuum.\nTo understand these excitations better, it is convenient\nto define the conserving charges\n\nQ\u03c1\u2212 = (Q1 \u2212 Q2 )/2,\n\nQ\u03c3\u00b1 = S1z \u00b1 S2z ,\n\n(21)\n\nV.\n\nANOMALOUS SCALING AT FINITE\nINTERACTION STRENGTH\n\nThe unexpected enlarged SO(6) symmetry for extremely small U/t is beautiful but can it survive when\nthe interaction strength increases? Suppose \u2206i denotes\nthe gaps for different fundamental fermions. If the SO(6)\nsymmetry is no longer exact, the gap ratios will deviate\nfrom unity and can be calculated from the coupling ra-\n\n\f6\ntios at the cutoff length scale.15 When DSE occurs, the\nequality among Ki and Bij implies that the ratios among\nthe couplings at the cutoff length scale are universal,\ngi (lc )/gj (lc ) = ri /rj , where ri are order-one constants\nsolely depending on the enlarged symmetry. Thus, it is\nconvenient to define the deviations of the coupling ratios\nas a measure for the enlarged symmetry,\nDij =\n\nri\ngi (lc )\n\u2212 ,\ngj (lc ) rj\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the cutoff length scale is defined by |c\u03c311 (lc )| =\n1. If the bare couplings only deviate from the enlarged\nsymmetry slightly, one can show that Dij \u221d (U/2\u03c0t)1/2\nfor the SO(6) symmetry.15 Following a standard scaling\nargument, the gap ratios at finite interaction strength\nalso show anomalous scaling,\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n\u2206i\nU\n+ ...,\n(23)\n= 1 + Cij\n\u2206j\n2\u03c0Nx t\nwhere Cij are order-one constants. The universal exponent 1/2 is related to the enlarged SO(6) symmetry and\ndoes not depend on whether the ground state is in the\ndSC or CDW phase.\nHowever, these analytic results are not necessarily applicable to our situation. For physical short-range interactions, the bare couplings deviate from the desired\nSO(6) symmetry significantly and the predictions from\nperturbation theory may become fragile. Thus, we numerically integrate the RG flows for U/t varying from\n10\u22125 to 1 and directly compute the coupling ratios at\nl = lc . The numerical results are shown in Fig. 3. It is\ntruly remarkable that the scaling form with exponent 1/2\nholds true for over five orders of the interaction strength!\nFurther increases in U/t >\n\u223c O(1) will deviate from the\nanomalous scaling regime. Since the constants Cij are\ndifficult to derive from perturbation theory, we resort\nto a numerical approach to determine at what interaction strength the SO(6) symmetry is no longer a good\napproximation. Starting from different bare interaction\nstrengths, we compare the coefficients Ki and Bij at the\ncutoff length scale, as shown in Fig. 4. For U/t <\n\u223c 0.5, all\ncoefficients deviate by less than 20% and the SO(6) symmetry serves as a good approximation. However, when\nU/t >\n\u223c O(1), the charge sector K1 increases rather rapidly\nand ruins the SO(6) symmetry. Note that this is also\nwhere the scaling form starts to break down. However,\nnot all equalities are broken at the same time. Interestingly, even for U/t = 4, one can read from Fig. 4 that\nthe coefficients in the spin sector remain approximately\nequal, K2 \u2248 K3 \u2248 B23 . A closer examination reveals\nthat B12 \u2248 B13 also holds.\nThe secret message embedded in the approximate\nequalities of the coefficients can be revealed by the\nrefermionization technique. After refemionization the effective Hamiltonian now takes the form,\nX\nX\nL\nL\nHN = g2\nGR\nGR\nAB GAB + g4\nab Gab\nAB\n\na,b\n\n+ g24\n\nX\n\nL\nGR\naA GaA .\n\n(24)\n\na,A\n\nHere the upper-case indices A, B = 1, 2 while the lowercase ones a, b = 3, 4, 5, 6. The SO(6) symmetry is now\nbroken into the smaller SO(2)\u00d7SO(4) symmetry. The\nSO(2)\u223cU(1) is expected because of the conservation of\nthe relative charge Q\u03c1\u2212 . Even though the SO(6) symmetry is destroyed in the physical regime U/t \u223c 2 \u2212 4,\nthe enlarged SO(4) symmetry in the spin sector is surprising. Since the kinks/antikinks are composed of solitons in all bosonic fields, the eight-fold degeneracy still\nholds, although the gap ratio between the \u221a\nfundamental\nfermions and the kinks will no longer be 2 as in the\nSO(6) regime. Meanwhile, the six-fold degeneracy of the\nfundamental fermions is broken down to four-fold. An experimental investigation of these degeneracies in metallic\nzigzag carbon nanotubes should prove interesting.\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the above sections, we study the correlation effects in doped metallic zigzag carbon nanotubes by using both the one-loop renormalization group and the\nnon-perturbative bosonization techniques. In particular, we are interested in the ground state properties in\nthe presence of short-range interactions. Note that, if\na nanotube is placed near a conducting plate, the longrange Coulomb interactions are screened and the resulting short-range interactions can be modelled by on-site\nand nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions U , V and V\u22a5\nrespectively.\nBy integrating out the gapped modes, the metallic\nzigzag nanotube can be mapped into an effective twoleg model. Due to the delocalization of electrons around\nthe tube, the effective interactions are reduced by 1/Nx\nand thus can be treated as weak-coupling perturbations.\nHowever, since the energy of the gapped modes (which\nwe integrated out) scales to O(t/Nx ), the two-leg model\nwill break down when Nx is too large and the multibands\nmust be included.\nUsing both analytic and numeric means, we determine\nthe phase diagram of the ground states. For U/t < 0.5 (t\nis the hopping strength), dynamical symmetry enlargement occurs and the low-energy excitations are described\nby the SO(6) Gross-Neveu model. However, for realistic\nmaterial parameters U/t \u223c O(1), the charge sector decouples but there remains an enlarged SO(4) symmetry\nin the spin sector.\nFinally, we thank the grant supports from the National\nScience Council in Taiwan through NSC 94-2112-M-007031(HHL) and NSC 93-2112-M007-005 (HHL).\nAPPENDIX A: CHIRAL FIELD EXPANSION\n\nIn this appendix we derive the chiral field expansion of\nthe fermion operator dqi in Eqs. (10) and (11). We firstly\n\n\f7\ntake a Fourier transform of the hopping Hamiltonian Eq.\n(7) and show that the eigenvalues are E\u00b1 = \u00b12t| cos kb|\nfor which we can define two eigenfunctions c\u00b1 (k). If k\nis chosen to lie in the interval [0, \u03c0/b] we can write the\noriginal fermion operators in terms of the new eigenfunctions,\n1\ndq1 (k) = \u221a [cq+ (k) + cq\u2212 (k)]\n2\nsign(k \u2212 kF ) ikF \u03b4\n\u221a\ndq2 (k) =\ne\n[cq+ (k) \u2212 cq\u2212 (k)] (A1)\n2\nwhere the Fermi momentum is kF = \u03c0/2b.\nIf we take a spatial Fourier transform we need only\nretain the soft modes, which lie near the Fermi point,\ndq1 (y) = \u221a\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\ncq\u2212 (kF + p),\ncq+ (kF + p),\n\n0\u2264p\u2264\u039b\n(A3)\n\u2212\u039b \u2264 p \u2264 0.\n\nTherefore, after taking the Fourier transform of the chiral\nfields from p to y we obtain the first part of Eq. (10).\nNote that y = 2mb so eikF y = e\u2212ikF y .\nSimilarly we may write dq2 (y + b \u2212 \u03b4) in terms of the\nchiral fields. In this case we find that the finite offset \u03b4 in\nthe spatial coordinate is cancelled by the eikF \u03b4 which appears in the expansion of dq2 (k) in Eq. (A1). Therefore,\nthe lattice operator in terms of cq\u00b1 (kF \u00b1 p) is\n\ndq2 (y + b + \u03b4) = \u221a\n\n1 X\n[cq+ (kF + p)ei(kF +p)(y+b)\n2N p\n\n+ cq+ (kF \u2212 p)ei(kF \u2212p)y\n\n\u2212 cq+ (kF \u2212 p)ei(kF \u2212p)(y+b)\n\n+ cq\u2212 (kF + p)ei(kF +p)y\n\n\u2212 cq\u2212 (kF + p)ei(kF +p)(y+b)\n+ cq\u2212 (kF \u2212 p)ei(kF \u2212p)(y+b) ]\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 p0 \u2264 \u039b for some cutoff \u039b.
