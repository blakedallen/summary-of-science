INTRODUCTION\n\nAs the temperature is increased from below the bulk triple point, some solids begin to\nmelt from their surfaces inward. If the thickness of the melted layer increases without limit\nas the temperature approaches the bulk triple point, then the solid is said to undergo surface\nmelting [1,2]. The melting is incomplete if the thickness of the melted film remains finite as\nthe temperature increases at all temperatures including the triple point. A special case of\nincomplete surface melting where the liquid film thickness is zero is sometimes referred to as\nsurface nonmelting. For example, it was found that the P b(110) surface melts. The P b(111)\n1\n\n\fsurface does not melt, whereas P b(100) exhibits incomplete melting. Therefore, incomplete\nor blocked melting appears on (100) fcc metal surfaces with an intermediate packing density\nbetween (110) and (111) [3,4]. It is characterized by a quasi-liquid film of the finite and\nsmall thickness. Surface melting was studied for several metals and other materials, such\nas ice, germanium, and multilayers of gases adsorbed on graphite [1,2]. High-temperature\ndisordering for surfaces of several organic materials was also studied.\nX-ray reflectivity measurements were used for high-temperature studies of the (100) face\nof caprolactam (C6 H11 ON) [5,6]. Initially a series of layering transition followed by prewetting was suggested, but later a surface hydration mechanism was proposed for temperature\ndisordering of this surface. Chernov and Yakovlev studied surface melting for the (001) and\n(010) faces of biphenyl (C12 H10 ) using the ellipsometry technique [7]. They found that the\nthickness of a quasi-liquid layer at 0.5 K below the bulk melting point reaches 100\u00c5 for\nthe (001) face and 300\u00c5 for the (010) face. In contrast, de Jeu and coworkers using the\nsynchrotron X-ray reflectivity measurements have shown the absence of surface melting for\nthe (001) face of the bulk biphenyl up to 2 K below the melting point [8]. It was proposed\nthat surface melting observed by Chernov and Yakovlev is induced by the roughness of the\nglass used in their ellipsometry experiment [8]. Surface properties of biphenyl, caprolactam,\nand other organic materials and organic thin films at high temperatures deserve further\nexperimental and theoretical studies. Investigations of organic films are also important for\napplications, such as tribology and lubrication, corrosion inhibition, modification of the substrate optical properties, molecular electronics, and various industrial chemical processes.\nSurface melting for a \u223c 10 layer thick film of CH4 adsorbed on MgO(100) was studied by\nneutron scattering [9,10]. It was found that the thickness of the quasi-liquid phase changes\nfrom one layer at 72 K to \u223c 6 layers at 90.3 K. (At atmospheric pressure the bulk melting\npoint of methane is 90.66 K, whereas the liquid-vapour transition occurs at 111.56 K.) The\nneutron-scattering measurements of the translational diffusion coefficient above 72 K have\nshown that this quantity is in the 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 range, i.e., it has a value typical for mobility\nin quasi-liquid films. It was found that for a methane thick film (\u223c 20 layers) at T = 94 K\n(i.e., above the bulk melting temperature) almost all layers are liquefied [10]. Recently the\nlayering and melting properties of methane on MgO(100) were studied between 70 K and 96\nK using high-resolution adsorption isotherms and for the film thickness of up to five layers.\n[11]. Melting transition was observed at 80 K for the monolayer, and at 85 K for layers 2\nthrough 4.\nRelated to the experiments on surface melting of bulk caprolactam and biphenyl, it would\nbe interesting to study surface melting of a bulk methane. These studies should determine\nwhether surface melting of the CH4 film on MgO is inherent feature of this organic material,\nor it is induced by the substrate. Interfacial melting is an appearance of a liquid film at\nthe interface between one solid material and the substrate of the other material as the\nbulk melting point of the first material is approached [12,13]. Therefore, surface melting is a\nspecial case of interfacial melting where the substrate is the vapor phase of the first material.\nIn this work long-range interactions important for surface melting of a bulk methane, as well\nas for interfacial melting of a methane film on the MgO substrate are analyzed using the\ntheory of Dzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii (DLP) [14]. Our findings revealed that\ncomplete surface melting exists for the bulk methane. Because of an attractive interaction\nbetween interfaces melting is absent at the boundary between the CH4 film and the MgO\n2\n\n\fsubstrate.\nIn the following the DLP theory of the van der Waals interaction between planar interfaces and its consequences for surface melting are described in Sec. II. The calculation of\nfrequency dependent dielectric functions of CH4 and MgO is discussed in Sec. III. Results\nand discussion for the surface and interfacial melting problems are presented in Sec. IV. A\nsummary and conclusions are given in Sec. V.\nII. SURFACE MELTING AND VAN DER WAALS FORCES\n\nThe surface free energy per unit area for a system with a quasi-liquid film of the thickness\nl, at the temperature T is [1,2,15]\nF (l, T ) = \u03b3sl + \u03b3lv + Lm (1 \u2212 T /Tm )l + Fsr + Flr .\n\n(1)\n\nIn this equation \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv are the free energies of the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces,\nrespectively, Lm is the latent heat of melting per unit volume, and Tm is the bulk melting\ntemperature. The fourth term Fsr represents the gain in interfacial energy associated with\nthe wetting of the solid surface by a quasi-liquid film. This term is the result of shortrange interactions. Their contribution is oscillatory and decreases exponentially to zero\nfor large l. Short-range forces produce a logarithmic temperature dependence of the liquid\nfilm thickness as the bulk melting temperature is approached. Long range van der Waals\ninteractions are given by the last term Flr in Eq. (1). The contribution of the van der Waals\nforces for non-retarded interactions (where l is much smaller than the wavelength of light for\na characteristic excitations) is given by Hl\u22122 . The parameter H is the Hamaker constant\nand gives information about the magnitude of the van der Waals interactions in different\nmedia [16]. (Sometimes H \u2032 = 12\u03c0H or H \u2032\u2032 = \u221212\u03c0H are called the Hamaker constant.)\nSurface melting occurs when H > 0, i.e., when two interfaces (solid-liquid and liquid-vapour)\nrepel each other. Then Flr (l) is monotonously decreasing function, or its minimum is not\ndeep enough to bind the interface. The van der Waals contribution produces a power-law\ntemperature dependence of the liquid film thickness as T \u2192 Tm\n\"\n\nLm (Tm \u2212 T )\nl=\n2HTm\n\n#\u22121/3\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nFor H < 0 two interfaces attract each other and the melting is at most incomplete. Then a\ndeep minimum exists on the free energy curve Flr , and the interface is trapped there.\nDzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii developed the theory of long-range dispersion\ninteraction between macroscopic bodies [14,16]. The van der Waals interaction between\ninterfaces is a consequence of electromagnetic fluctuations in a polarizable medium and the\ndiscontinuity of the dielectric function across the boundaries. In the DLP theory the force\nbetween interfaces (such as those shown in Fig. 1) is a function of the frequency-dependent\ndielectric functions \u01eb(\u03c9) of materials in contact. In the following all media are taken as\nisotropic and continuous. The free energy per unit area of two media (1 and 2) separated\nby a film of thickness l (media 3, see Fig. 1) is [14,17,12]\n\n3\n\n\fZ \u221e\n\u221e\n(x \u2212 x1 )(x \u2212 x2 )\nkT X\n\u2032\ndx x (ln(1 \u2212\nexp(\u2212x))\nFlr (l, T ) =\n2\n8\u03c0l m=0 rm\n(x + x1 )(x + x2 )\n(\u01eb2 x \u2212 \u01eb3 x2 )(\u01eb1 x \u2212 \u01eb3 x1 )\n+ln(1 \u2212\nexp(\u2212x))),\n(\u01eb2 x + \u01eb3 x2 )(\u01eb1 x + \u01eb3 x1 )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nrm = 2l\u03bem (\u01eb3 )1/2 /c,\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\u0012\n\n2\nx1,2 = x2 \u2212 rm\n(1 \u2212\n\n\u01eb1,2\n)\n\u01eb3\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nThe dielectric functions \u01eb1 (\u03c9), \u01eb2 (\u03c9), and \u01eb3 (\u03c9) are evaluated at imaginary frequencies i\u03bem =\ni(2\u03c0kT /h\u0304)m. The functions \u01eb(i\u03be) are positive, real and decrease monotonically from the\nstatic dielectric function \u01eb0 for \u03be = 0, to 1 as \u03be \u2192 \u221e. In the above expressions k, h\u0304, and\nc are the Boltzmann and Planck constants and velocity of light, respectively. The prime\non the sum in Eq.

An oscillator model of the dielectric response is then used to generate data, i.e.,\nthe dielectric function is represented by\n\u01eb(\u03c9) = 1 +\n\nX\ni\n\nfi\n,\nei \u2212 ih\u0304\u03c9gi \u2212 (h\u0304\u03c9)2\n\n(7)\n\n2\n\nwhere fi , ei , and gi are fitting parameters. The DLP theory was recently applied to surface\nmelting of ice [17,12], germanium, and several metals [18,19]. Unfortunately, optical and\ndielectric properties of many organic materials are less studied than, for example of metals,\nsemiconductors, or H2 O. As a consequence, we were not able to find necessary optical\ndata for biphenyl and caprolactam, two organic materials for which experiments on surface\nmelting were performed. In contrast, we found data for optical properties of organic material\nCH4 and dielectric substrate MgO [22,23].\nIII. DIELECTRIC FUNCTIONS OF METHANE AND MGO\n\nThe complex dielectric functions \u01eb(i\u03be) were constructed using experimental data for\noptical constants of CH4 and MgO [22,23]. As suggested in Ref. [24] we minimized the\nobjective function\nE=\n\nN\nX\n\nj=1\n\n\"\n\n\u01ebr (\u03c9j ) \u2212 \u01ebexp\n\u01ebi (\u03c9j ) \u2212 \u01ebexp\ni (\u03c9j )\nr (\u03c9j )\n+\nexp\nexp\n\u01ebr (\u03c9j )\n\u01ebi (\u03c9j )\n4\n\n#2\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere \u01ebr (\u03c9) and \u01ebi (\u03c9) are the real and imaginary parts of a dielectric function given by\nEq. (7), and 'exp' denotes experimental values taken from Refs. [22,23]. Therefore, the\ncalculation was performed by finding a minimum of an objective function based on a simultaneous fitting of both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. We found\nthat, in comparison with some other functions, the functional form in Eq. (8) is suitable\nfor minimization. In principle, the most important factor in the minimization process is the\nquality of experimental data, i.e., the number of points and their distribution. It is known\nthat the main contribution belongs to data in the UV region of the spectra [20,21]. The UV\npart of the spectrum for MgO is represented with many points [23]. In contrast, in the UV\nspectra for the solid and liquid methane few points exist [22]. A smaller number of points\ngives more freedom in the choice of the parameters which minimize Eq. (8). Therefore,\nmore local minima exist and they produce similar values of the objective function. This\nis a limitation for the calculation of dielectric properties of methane. Fortunately previous\ncalculations for other materials have shown that the complex dielectric functions \u01eb(i\u03be) which\nenter expressions in the DLP theory are not very sensitive to the fitting procedure and the\ndetailed experimental information. As suggested in Ref. [20] and followed by others [17,12],\nwe used the constraint \u01ebr = n2vis , where nvis is the refractive index in the visible part of\nthe spectrum. The value nvis is known with a great accuracy and fitting with this constraint gives better results. Objective functions were minimized using the simplex method\n[25,26]. The accuracy of calculation was checked by changing minimization routines and\nalso by calculating dielectric functions for other materials where extensive data are available\n[12,16\u201321].\nMartonchik and Orton, motivated by astrophysical applications, recently calculated the\noptical constants of liquid and solid methane using the spectra from the literature [22].\nLiquid methane was studied at the boiling and melting temperatures, whereas the solid\nphase I of methane was studied at the melting point and at T = 30 K. (The solid phase I is\nthe face centered cubic phase of methane which at atmospheric pressure exists for T > 20\nK.) Therefore, data obtained by Martonchik and Orton for the solid and liquid methane at\nthe melting point were used to model the solid and liquid phase. For the vapor phase we\nput \u01eb = 1. The static dielectric function of the gas methane is \u01eb = 1.000944 [27]. The fits for\nCH4 were performed to match dielectric functions at zero frequency. These static dielectric\nfunctions are \u01eb0 = 1.67 for the liquid methane, and \u01eb0 = 1.74 for the solid methane [22].\nThe calculated complex dielectric functions of the solid and liquid methane are shown in\nFig. 2. Corresponding fitting parameters are given in Tables I and II. The curves \u01eb(i\u03be) for\nthe solid and liquid methane are close to each other, but do not cross. In similar calculation\nfor surface melting of ice it was found that the complex dielectric functions of water and ice\ncross at 10 eV (i.e., for m \u223c 205) [17,12].\nThe detailed review of optical properties of MgO was given by Roessler and Huffman\n[23]. The values of optical constants were tabulated in the range (0.002 \u2212 586) eV. Because\nof a large set of data we use only selected points. From these data the function \u01eb(i\u03be) for\nMgO was constructed. The static dielectric function of MgO is \u01eb0 = 9.8 [23]. Here, as in\nRef. [28] where the fitting based on a double band was performed, we did not match the\nstatic dielectric function. The value of static dielectric function of MgO is much larger than\nthe average value of \u01ebr in the UV part of the spectrum. Additional problem is the existence\nof a close sharp peak at h\u0304\u03c9 = 7.8 eV. Therefore, the inclusion of the static dielectric function\n5\n\n\finto the fit for MgO prevents a good behavior of the whole fitted curve. Fitting parameters\nfor MgO are given in Table III. The complex dielectric functions \u01eb(i\u03be) of MgO is shown in\nFig. 2. Our four-band result is almost the same as a double band calculation from Ref. [28].\nIV. SURFACE AND INTERFACIAL MELTING\nA. Bulk methane\n\nIn surface melting problem the frequency dependent dielectric functions of solid, liquid\n(melt), and gas methane are respectively: \u01eb1 = \u01ebs (\u03c9), \u01eb3 = \u01ebl (\u03c9), and \u01eb2 = 1 (see Fig.\n1). The integral in Eq. (3) was calculated numerically using the Gaussian method. The\naccuracy of the integration technique was checked by changing numerical procedures and\nalso by reproducing the results for ice [17]. The calculated free energy as a function of liquid\nfilm thickness is shown in Fig. 3. The minimum is reached for l \u2192 \u221e. This functional\nform of F (l) is typical for complete surface melting. We found that the Hamaker constant\nis H = 5.26 \u00d7 10\u221222 J. Similar values were calculated for metals with melted surfaces, such\nas P b, Al, and Au [18].\nB. Methane film on MgO\n\nIn interfacial melting problem, and for interfaces shown in Fig. 1: \u01eb1 = \u01ebM gO (\u03c9) is\ndielectric function for MgO, \u01eb2 = \u01ebs (\u03c9) is for a solid phase, and \u01eb3 = \u01ebl (\u03c9) is for a liquid\nphase of methane. Therefore, we consider the solid CH4 - liquid CH4 - MgO substrate\nsystem. The same numerical procedure as for the surface melting problem was applied. The\nfree energy is shown in Fig. 4. The Hamaker constant is H = \u22126.03 \u00d7 10\u221222 J. Therefore,\nthe van der Waals forces produce an attractive interaction between interfaces and prevent\ninterfacial melting. The functional form of F (l) shown in Fig. 4 was not found for interfacial\nmelting of ice on various substrates [12], but two other forms of F (l) were calculated there.\nThey correspond to complete and incomplete interfacial melting of ice on the particular\nsubstrate.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe interaction of interfaces present in surface melting of the bulk methane and interfacial melting of the CH4 film on the MgO substrate is analyzed within the Dzyaloshinskii,\nLifshitz, and Pitaevskii theory of the van der Waals interaction. Frequency dependent dielectric functions for these materials are calculated from optical data. It was found that\ncomplete surface melting exists for methane. Our study is the first investigation of surface\nmelting properties of the bulk methane. We also found that the van der Waals interactions\ndo not produce interfacial melting of the CH4 film on the MgO substrate. Therefore, premelting observed in the experimental investigations of the CH4 films on the MgO substrate\n[9\u201311] is inherent feature of the bulk methane. Methane is till now the only organic material\nfor which clear complete surface melting was found. The results obtained here depend on\nthe quality of the optical measurements used to model dielectric functions. Nevertheless,\n6\n\n\fthese results shed light on the interaction between interfaces in surface and interfacial melting involving methane. These results suggest experimental studies of surface melting of the\nbulk methane, for example using the synchrotron X-ray reflectivity. In addition, ab initio\nmolecular dynamics study of the high-temperature properties of methane surfaces is feasible,\nsimilar as a recent simulation of a high-pressure behavior for bulk CH4 [29]. It is important to do all necessary optical measurements for biphenyl and caprolactam, and then the\ncalculation of the van der Waals interactions for these materials. There is a possibility that\nsurface melting observed for biphenyl on the glass surface [7] is interfacial melting induced\nby the dielectric properties of the substrate. Till now the roughness of the glass and impurity\ninduced interfacial melting were proposed to explain the results of Chernov and Yakovlev.\nA possibility of interfacial melting induced by the van der Waals forces for biphenyl on the\nglass also explains the absence of surface melting for the bulk biphenyl found using the X-ray\nreflectivity [8]. Recent atomic force microscopy study of the (001) surfaces of n \u2212 C23 H48\nparaffin crystals [30] shows that this technique gives a good opportunity to investigate melt\ngrowth on a molecular scale for surfaces of methane and other organic materials.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been carried out under the HR-MZT project 119206 - \"Dynamical Properties of Surfaces\".
