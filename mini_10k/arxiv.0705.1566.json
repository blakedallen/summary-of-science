These are loci of low energy excitations\ncovering part of the fermi surface, that suddenly appear above Tc instead of the nodal quasiparticles.\nBased on a semiclassical theory, we argue that partial Fermi surfaces arise naturally in a d-wave\nsuperconductor that is destroyed by thermal phase fluctuations. Specifically, we show that the\nelectron spectral function develops a square root singularity at low frequencies for wave-vectors\npositioned on the bare Fermi surface. We predict a temperature dependence of the arc length that\ncan partially account for results of recent angle resolved photo emission (ARPES) experiments.\n\nThe transition from a superconductor to a normal\nstate at Tc can take place in two qualitatively different ways. Conventional metallic superconductors take\nthe BCS-Eliashberg route by which the amplitude of the\ncomplex order parameter |\u2206|ei\u03c6 vanishes at Tc together\nwith the quasi-particle gap. Thus the transition is accompanied by formation of a normal Fermi surface. Phase\nfluctuations play a negligible role in this transition and\nTc is determined by the zero temperature gap \u22060 . On\nthe other hand, in superconductors with small superfluid\ndensity ns , the phase-stiffness defines a temperature scale\nT\u03b8 \u223c ns /m\u22c6 that may be much lower than \u2206. The transition then occurs at Tc \u223c T\u03b8 due to disordering of the\nphase by thermal fluctuations. This is thought to be\nthe case in the underdoped cuprate superconductors1,2 ,\nwhere Tc is seen to increase with doping concomitantly\nwith the superfluid density1 and is anti correlated with\nthe quasi-particle gap. Is such a transition, driven by\nphase fluctuations, accompanied by formation of a Fermi\nsurface as is the BCS case?\nNaively, the answer is negative. At temperatures not\ntoo high above Tc (T < TMF \u223c \u22060 ) pairing survives in\nthe normal state. One might expect that in this regime\nthe single particle spectral function remains peaked at\nfinite frequency of order \u22060 , the energy needed to dissociate a pair. This reasoning is certainly correct for\nan s-wave superconductor with clear separation of scales\nbetween the phase stiffness and the larger quasi-particle\ngap. Does it still hold in a d-wave superconductor, where\nsuch a clear separation of scales cannot exist because of\nthe vanishing gap at the nodal points?\nIn this paper we investigate the evolution of the Fermi\nsurface in the normal state of a d-wave superconductor by\nstudying the coupling between nodal quasi-particles and\nstrong phase fluctuations. Our main result is that for any\nvalue of the anti-nodal gap a sharp Fermi surface forms\nin the normal state immediately above Tc . Nevertheless\nthis is not a normal Fermi liquid. Because of coupling\nto thermal phase fluctuations, the quasi-particle peak on\nthe Fermi surface is replaced by a square root singularity\n\u221a\nin the spectral function A(k = kf , \u03c9) = a(k)/ \u03c9. This\nsingularity is present everywhere on the Fermi surface,\nbut at wave-vectors far from the gap nodes, that is \u03b4k >\n\np\nh\u2207\u03c62 i \u2261 q0 (T ), it is exponentially suppressed by the\npre-factor a(k). Therefore a peak at zero frequency is\nobservable in practice only along arcs of length \u223c q0 on\nthe Fermi surface, centered at the nodal points. The\ndominant spectral feature further from the node, is a\nbroad peak at frequency \u03c9 = \u2206k .\nBroadening of the quasi-particle peak at \u03c9 = \u2206k by\nthermal phase fluctuations in the normal state was noted\nin previous analyses3,4 . However the appearance of a\nsingularity at zero frequency signaling the formation of\na Fermi surface, was overlooked. We argue that this\nphysics underlies the formation of the Fermi arcs seen\nin angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nof underdoped cuprates5,6 .\nBefore proceeding we note that a number of recent\nworks proposed alternative mechanisms for the formation of Fermi arcs and their evolution with temperature.\nVarma and Zhu8 have argued that current fluctuations in\na state with broken time reversal symmetry can explain\nthe observed phenomena. Paramekanti and Zhao9 postulated that the normal state of the underdoped cuprates is\ndominated by a quantum critical point with deconfined\nspinons at the critical doping level for onset of superconductivity. In their theory, the broadening of the spectral\npeaks accompanying the deconfinement leads to formation of the arcs. Kim et al 10 have discussed the formation\nof Fermi arcs due to critical fluctuations of an underlying nematic order parameter in the presence of quenched\ndisorder.\nFor concreteness and to make contact with experiments\nin the cuprates, we consider a layered structure relevant\nto these materials. The main ingredient in our analysis, leading to emergence of a Fermi surface, is the coupling of the dirac quasi-particles to the local currents\njs = ns \u2207\u03c6 induced by the phase fluctuations. These currents are conveniently split into two contributions with\nmarkedly different effect on the quasiparticles: A transverse part originating from vortex configurations and an\nirrotational, or longitudinal part. We find that the interesting effects on the single particle spectral function\nresult from the transverse fluctuations. To simplify the\nsubsequent analysis we treat the vortices as purely thermal fluctuations and neglect their dynamics altogether.\n\n\f2\n(a)\nk\n\nky\n\nq\n\nkx\nE k (b)\n\nq\n\n(c)\n\nq\n\nAq (k, \u03c9) = |uk\u2212q |2 \u03b4(\u03c9\u2212Ek\u2212q (q))+|vk\u2212q |2 \u03b4(\u03c9+Eq\u2212k (q))\n(3)\nand the quasi-particle dispersion to leading order in q is\ngiven by\n\nvf\n\nvf\n\nk\n\nq\n\n(d)\n\nk\n\nHere Aq (k, \u03c9) is the spectral function in the presence of a\nuniform supercurrent parameterized by a wave-vector q.\nSuch current corresponds to a pairing field that depends\non the center of mass coordinate of the pair as \u2206k ei2q*R .\nWe may now use the standard BCS formalism in order\nto calculate Aq (k, \u03c9) for a given supercurrent q. This is\neasily seen to be\n\nk\n\nFIG. 1: In the presence of static current, the dirac cone, seen\nin panel (a) on the bare Fermi surface, is shifted in energy\nand boosted by the wave-vector q associated with the supercurrent. If the current is parallel to vf as in (b,c) the net\neffect is that the cone slides up or down leaving one point\nof zero energy excitations invariant. If q \u22a5 vf as in (d) the\nnodal point is transported along the bare Fermi surface. As\nshown in panel (a) there is a continuous range of currents q\nthat lead to a zero energy peak on each point of the bare\nFermi surface. This pile up of spectral weight results in a\nsingular peak at zero energy on the Fermi surface.\n\nThis is a reasonable assumption in the normal state where\nvortex motion is expected to be diffusive and slow on electronic time scales. The longitudinal fluctuations, by contrast, can be shown to be highly quantum11 . However,\nwe will show that their coupling to the quasi-particles is\nirrelevant, even if the small gap in their dispersion, due\nto the c-axis Josephson plasmon, is neglected.\nUnder these assumptions, the electron Green's function relevant to ARPES is given by:\nZ\n<\nG (r, t) = Dj\u22a5 (r)P [j\u22a5 (r)] h\u03c8 \u2020 (0, 0)\u03c8(r, t)i{j\u22a5 (r)} .\n\n(1)\nThe external integral implements a thermal average over\nthe transverse currents (or vortex configurations). The\nthermal weight of a current configuration, P [j\u22a5 (r)], is\ndetermined by a classical x \u2212 y model12 . The internal\naverage is the Green's function in a given static current\nconfiguration. This includes integration over the dynamical longitudinal phase fluctuations.\nIn the spirit of refs. [3,7] we will approximate (1) by\nan average over a distribution of uniform currents. This\namounts to a semiclassical approximation valid if spatial variations of the current over a Fermi wavelength are\nsmall (i.e. kf \u03be \u226b 1). Interference effects due to coherent scattering of quasi-particles by vortices are neglected\nin this scheme, which is justified at the temperatures of\ninterest in the normal state.\nWith these approximations, the spectral function on\nthe two dimensional plane is given by:\nZ\nA(k, \u03c9) = d2 qP (q)Aq (k, \u03c9).\n(2)\n\nEk (q) \u2248 vf (k) * q +\n\nq\n\u03bek2 + \u22062k .\n\n(4)\n\nfor k near the bare Fermi surface, defined by \u03bekf = \u01ebkf \u2212\n\u03bc = 0. To this order in q, the coherence factors uk\nand vk are\nis |uk |2 =\np unchanged by the 2current, that\n2\n2\n2\n(1 + \u03bek / \u03bek + \u2206k )/2, and |vk | = 1 \u2212 |uk | .\nThe essential physics leading to emergence of a Fermi\nsurface in the normal state can be understood qualitatively from Eqs. (3) and (4). Fig. 1 shows the dispersion\nof the quasi-particle peaks in Aq (k, \u03c9) for different directions of the supercurrent. The momentum of the peak\nis shifted by q because of the boost associated with the\nsupercurrent, but its frequency is also \"Doppler shifted\"\nby vf * q. For a current parallel (or anti-parralel) to vf ,\nthis amounts to the dirac cone sliding up (or down) on\nthe slope of the original dispersion as seen in Fig. 1(b,c).\nThe important thing to note is that in both cases there\nis a zero frequency peak, or \"Fermi point\", whose position is independent of the current. On the other hand,\nfor current perpendicular to vf there is no doppler shift,\nand the node is simply transported a distance q along\nthe Fermi surface (Fig. 1d). In general an arbitrary\ncurrent q will always lead to a zero frequency peak located precisely on the bare Fermi surface. The parallel\ncomponent of q leaves the zero frequency peak in place\non the nodal point, while the perpendicular component\ntransports it on the fermi surface. In fact, as shown in\nFig. 1a, for every point on the Fermi surface, there is a\ncontinuous range of wave-vectors q that lead to a zero\nfrequency peak at that point. This pile up is the origin of the zero frequency singularity that develops on the\nFermi surface. However, the probability for a current\nfluctuation with wavevector larger than a typical q0 is\nstrongly suppressed in the distribution P (q). Therefore\non points of the fermi surface at a distance larger than\nq0 from the node the singularity is multiplied by a very\nsmall pre-factor making it essentially unobservable.\nWe now turn to a systematic derivation of the spectral function using Eqs. (2),(3) and (4). We concentrate on wavevectors k sufficiently close to the nodes so\nthat we may approximate the dispersion by a Dirac cone.\nNamely: \u2206k = v\u2206 *(k\u2212kn ) and \u03bek = vf *(k\u2212kn ). Let us\nalso change variables from q to \u03b7 = vf * q and \u03b6 = v\u2206 * q.\nPlugging these definitions to (2) we have\n\n\f3\n\n1\nA(k, \u03c9) =\n2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b7d\u03b6P (\u03b7, \u03b6)\n\nX\n\ns=\u00b11\n\n\u03be\u2212\u03b7\n\n1 + sp\n(\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)2 + (\u2206 \u2212 \u03b6)2\n\nwhere for notational simplicity we omitted the subscript\nk from \u2206k and \u03bek . The distribution P (\u03b7, \u03b6) is obtained\nby a simple change of variables from P (q), which is taken\n2\nto be a gaussian of the form P (q) = N exp(\u2212 q2q(T ) )[3].\n0\nWe will later discuss the temperature dependence of q0 .\nIn Ref. [3], the integral (15) was approximated by\nexpanding to leading order in \u03b7/\u2206k and \u03b6/\u2206k . For k on\nthe Fermi surface far from a gap node this approximation\ndoes give the the dominant spectral feature, which in this\nregion is simply a broadened peak at frequency \u03c9 \u223c \u2206k .\nHowever, the expansion cannot be generally valid for a\nsuperconductor with gap nodes, on which these ratios\ndiverge. In particular, it cannot capture the pile up of\nlow energy spectral weight on the Fermi surface due to\nmovement of the Dirac cone in energy and momentum,\nas illustrated in Fig. 1.\nWe proceed to evaluate (15) without resorting to an\nexpansion in \u03b7/\u2206k and \u03b6/\u2206k . In what follows we outline the main steps in the derivation and relegate the\ndetails to the online supplementary information. First\nwe transform\nto the polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) defined by\np\nr = (\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)2 + (\u2206 \u2212 \u03b6)2 and cos \u03b8 = (\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)/r. This\nallows to resolve the delta functions in (15) by integrating over r.

For |\u03c9| 6= 0, the divergence at\n\u03b1 = \u22121 in the integrand of (20) is cut off by the first term\nin the exponent in (7), which effectively introduces a new\nlower bound to the integral. The singular contribution\nto the spectral function is now easily evaluated as:\nr\n2\n2 2\nvf q0\nAsing (k, \u03c9) = A0 (v\u2206 q0 )\u22121 e\u2212\u2206k /v\u2206 q0\n(8)\n|\u03c9|\n\nwhich is the advertised zero frequency singularity. A0 is a\nconstant of order unity. Note that the singular contribution comes from \u03b1 = \u22121, which in the original variables\ncorresponds to the range of currents q defined by the\ncondition q * v\u2206 = \u2206k . This is precisely the condition\nfor wave-vectors q illustrated in Fig. 1a that pile up low\nfrequency spectral weight on the point k on the Fermi\nsurface. If k is far from the node compared to a typical current fluctuation q0 , then \u2206/v\u2206 q0 is large and the\nsingularity is strongly suppressed by the exponential prefactor in (21). Then the dominant spectral feature is a\nbroad peak at frequency \u03c9 \u223c \u2206 obtained from taking the\nsaddle point of (20).\nThe ARPES spectrum is related to the spectral function via I(k, \u03c9) = nF (\u03c9)A(k, \u03c9). In Fig. 2 we plot this\nfunction for k points on the Fermi surface at varying distance from the node. The curves are obtained by numerical integration of (20) and the convolution with a narrow\ngaussian function which mimics the experimental resolution. The overall picture is appealingly similar to what\nis seen in ARPES experiments in the normal state of under doped cuprates5,6 . It is seen that the sharp peaks are\npinned to zero frequency along a line on the Fermi surface\nup to a critical distance from the node, which is of the\norder of q0 . At larger distance from the node the peak\ndeparts from zero frequency, quickly approaches \u03c9 = \u2206k\nand broadens considerably.\nA similar analysis as outlined above can be carried out\nfor points k on the line of nodes \u2206k = 0 away from the\n\n\f4\nFermi surface. In this case the singular contribution to\nthe spectral function is given by\nr\nvf q0\n,\n(9)\nAsing (k, \u03c9) = A0 (v\u2206 q0 )\u22121\n|\u03be \u2212 \u03c9|\nwhich appears as a sharp peak dispersing as \u03bek . This too\nis in qualitative agreement with ARPES.\nWe turn to discuss the nature of the phase field in\nthe normal state and the contribution of different types\nof fluctuations to the electron spectral function. The\nphase field of a fluctuating 2d superconductor can be\ndecomposed into a longitudinal (non singular) part and a\ntransverse, or vortex contribution. These components are\ngoverned by independent actions in the long wavelength\nlimit.\nLongitudinal phase fluctuations \u2013 These fluctuations\nmay be treated at the gaussian level. Physically they\ncorrespond to Josephson plasmons in the d-wave superconductor, which were studied in detail by Paramekanti\net al [11]. The structure of their spectrum in a layered\nsystem is as follows. At low momenta there is a wide\nregime of linear dispersion, with a small plasmon gap\n\u03c9pc due to the c-axis Josephson coupling. Experimentally, \u03c9pc \u2248 8 \u2212 10K in Bi221213\u201315 , which is lower than\ntypical temperatures of interest in the normal state of\nlightly underdoped cuprates. we shall therefore neglect\nthis gap. At the high momentum side, the linear plasmon\ndispersion terminates at a characteristic energy scale \u03c9p\nat q \u223c \u03c0/\u03be. In the cuprates \u03c9p is a high energy scale\nof order a few eV. Therefore, quantum dynamics of the\nplasmons must be taken into account fully at the temperatures of interest.\nHow do these fluctuations affect the fermion spectral\nfunction? The most relevant coupling between the Dirac\nFermions and the longitudinal phase fluctuations is the\ncurrent-current coupling4 of the form vf * \u2207\u03c6\u03c8\u0304\u03c3 \u03c8\u03c3 . The\nscaling dimension of this coupling is easily seen to be\n\u22121/2 making it irrelevant at low energies. Further scaling\narguments, and direct calculation, show that the life-time\nof quasi-particles due to this coupling diverges at low\nenergies as 1/\u03c4 \u223c (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebF )2 . At finite temperature, this\nwill be cut off at T 2 , which gives thermal broadening of\nthe quasi-particles. However a Fermi arc does not form\ndue to coupling to the longitudinal phase fluctuations.\nTransverse phase fluctuations\u2013 The fluctuations considered in the calculation of the electronic Green's function (1) are the transverse (vortex) contribution. Vortices\nare macroscopic objects whose motion is expected to be\noverdamped. This picture is supported by the fact that\nthe measured Nernst signal and diamagnetism in underdoped cuprates17 are consistent with the predictions from\na classical x \u2212 y model with overdamped dynamics18 . In\nwriting (1) as a static average, we assumed this dynamics\nto be sufficiently slow on quasi-particle timescales.\n1/2\nThe arc length at T > Tc is of order q0 (T ) = h\u2207\u03c62\u22a5 i .\nThat is, the width of the of the transverse current distribution, which we shall calculate within the classical two\ndimensional x \u2212 y model. We note that in the equivalent\n\ncoulomb gas model, q0 is P\nrelated to the vortex density\ncorrelation: q02 = (4\u03c0 2 /\u03a9) q hn(q)n(\u2212q)i/q2 .\nThis quantity was previously estimated3,4 in the\nhigh temperature limit using the Debye-H\u00fcckel\napproximation16.\nHere we present a different calculation of q0 (T ), using a variational approach. Our\nresult coincides with the Debye-H\u00fcckel approximation\nat high temperature, but can also be used at lower\ntemperatures, closer to TBKT . First we carry out the\nusual mapping of the coulomb gas onto the Sine-Gordon\nmodel:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1 1\n2y\n2\nSSG = d2 x\n(\u2207\u03b8)\n\u2212\ncos\n[\u03b8\n(x)\n+\n\u03bc\n(x)]\nv\n2 4\u03c0 2 K\n\u03bec2\n(10)\nHere K = J/T is the bare phase stiffness of the original x \u2212 y model, y = exp(\u2212Ec /T ) where Ec is the vortex\ncore energy, and \u03bec the core size. \u03bcv (x) is a local chemical\npotential that couples to the vortices, and allows the calculation of vortex density correlations. We shall now apply the self consistent harmonic approximation (SCHA),\nwhich is known to give good results for the correlations\nin the normal (i.e. gapped) phase19 . In this approach,\nthe cosine term in (10) is replaced by a quadratic mass\nterm 21 m2 \u03b82 . The mass is determined by minimizing the\nvariational free energy F0 + T hS \u2212 S0 i0 , where F0 is the\nfree energy of the quadratic variational action S0 and\nhi0 denotes a thermal average with respect to S0 . Given\n1\n\n\u03c0K\nthe solution m (T ) = \u03be\u03c0c (8yK) 2(1\u2212 2 ) , it is now straight\nforward to compute q0 within the variational action.\n\n(4\u03c0y)2\n2\u03c0K\n(m\u03bec )\n\u03bec2\nZ \u221e\ndrr ln r sinh [2\u03c0Kf (m\u03bec r)]\n\u00d7\n1\nZ\nd2 q eiq*x\nf (m |x|) =\n,\n(11)\n2\n2\n|q|< \u03be\u03c0 2\u03c0 q + m\nq02 (T ) =\n\nc\n\nEq. (36) can be shown to be of the Debye-H\u00fcckel form\nin the high temperature limit.\nThe parameters J, Ec , and \u03bec that control the temperature dependence of q0 , are not easily connected to observable properties of the cuprates. The parameter J is the\nbare superfluid stiffness of the x \u2212 y model. Nevertheless,\nin a d-wave superconductor it is expected to be temperature dependant J(T ) = J(0) \u2212 AT due to physics that\nlies out side of the pure x \u2212 y model, namely depletion of\nthe condensate by quiasiparticles at the gap nodes20 . In\nthe normal phase, the temperature dependence may well\nbe more complicated because of the emergent finite density of states at zero energy. However, to leading order in\nthe current fluctuations we may assume that the linear\ndecrease of J persists in the normal state. We take the\nparameter A from experiments, that measure the leading temperature dependence of the superfluid density22 .\nNote the distinction between J(T ) which is the bare stiffness of the x \u2212 y model and the macroscopic stiffness,\n\n\f5\n0.18\n0.16\n0.14\nE c=5T BKT\n\nq0/(\u03c0/a)\n\n0.12\n0.1\n\n7T BK\nE c=\n\nT\n\nT BKT\n\n0.08\n\n=9\nEc\n\nT\n\n2T BK\n\n0.06\n\n=1\nEc\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nT/TBKT\n\nFIG. 3: The Fermi arc length is related to the width q0 of the\ncurrent distribution. This is plotted as a function of temperature using eq. (36), for several values of Ec /TBKT (see text\nfor details).\n\nwhich vanishes in the normal state due to proliferation\nof vortices.\nThe results of the calculation of the arc length (36)\nare plotted in Fig. 3 for a range of values of Ec /TBKT .\nWe assumed that \u03bec = 5a. Near TBKT , q0 (T ) is exponentially suppressed. At higher temperatures, there is a\nregion where q0 increases rapidly due to the proliferation\nof free vortices, followed by a roughly linear increase region. Since we have assumed that J(T ) = J(0) \u2212 AT ,\nthe bare stiffness vanishes at some temperature (which is\nabout 3TBKT for our chosen value of A = 0.3). At this\ntemperature q0 (T ) diverges logarithmically, and the continuum description of the x \u2212 y model breaks down. The\ntemperature dependence of the bare stiffness J above Tc\nin the cuprates is not clear, even though there is some\nevidence that it continues to decay linearly over a considerable range21 .\nIn our treatment, we have neglected the inter-plane\nJosephson coupling. This coupling becomes relevant at\nsome Tc > TBKT , where a phase transition to a three\ndimensional ordered state occurs. At this temperature,\nour treatment of a two dimensional x \u2212 y model is no\nlonger valid, vortex formation is strongly suppressed, and\nwe expect q0 (T ) to drop abruptly to zero. Indeed, the\nobserved arc length seems to drop to zero at Tc [6].\nDiscussion and conclusions \u2013 Before concluding let us\nremark that, we have so far not payed special attention\nto effects of proximity to the Mott insulating state at half\nfilling. The simplest (though not necessarily the correct)\nway to include the effect of the strong local repulsion,\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nY. J. Uemura et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, 2317 (1989).\nV. J. Emery and S.

Within this\napproach, the current carried by a quasiparticle is renormalized by a factor \u03b1, which is proportional to the hole\ndoping x [20]. Hence the doppler shift of the quasiparticle dispersion (4) is renormalized by a similar factor, so\nthat vf * q \u2192 \u03b1vf * q. This would have a dramatic effect\non our earlier considerations. In particular, application\nof a static current with q parallel to vf would no longer\nleave invariant the point of zero energy excitations. Accordingly, the average over the current distribution (3),\nwould not result in a singular peak on the Fermi surface. Specifically, we find the leading edge of the EDC\non the Fermi surface behaves as |\u03c9| in this case. It is\ninteresting to note that the same renormalization factor\n\u03b1, which leads to the present discrepancy of slave boson\ntheory with experiment, is also responsible for its famous\nfailure20 to explain the doping independent slope of the\nsuperfluid density with temperature22 .\nTo summarize, we have shown that destruction of a\nd-wave superconductor by proliferation of thermal vortices must be accompanied by formation of at least a\npartial fermi surface. We argued that this phenomenon\nis fundamental to the appearance of Fermi arcs in the\nnormal state of underdoped cuprates5 , and may partially\nexplain their evolution with temperature6 . The main results rely on two central assumptions. The first is that\nvortices are purely thermal and their quantum dynamics may be neglected. The second is the calculation the\nfermion spectral function in the presence of static vortices within a semiclassical approximation along the lines\nof [7]. The semiclassical approximation was tested in numerical simulations23 , which verified that it is controlled\nby the small parameter v\u2206 /vf . It therefore seems safe to\napply the semiclassical approach to the high Tc cuprate\nsuperconductors, except in the very underdoped regime.\nIn extremely underdoped materials quantum dynamics\nof the vortices is also expected to be increasingly important, in violation of our first assumption. Indeed,\nthe onset of superconductivity possibly corresponds to\na quantum phase transition, driven by fluctuating quantum vortices24,25 . An important open question is how\nthe normal state we describe, that arises in a thermal\nvortex liquid, evolves to the highly quantum regime near\nthe critical doping for the onset of superconductivity.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to E.

In this case F0,\u2212\u2206 (\u03c9, \u03b1) = F0,\u2206 (\u2212\u03c9, \u03b1)\nand therefore (18) is reduced to\nA(k, \u03c9) =\n\n|\u03c9|\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nd\u03b1\n\n\u22121\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)1/2\nF0,\u2206 (|\u03c9|, \u03b1)\n(1 + \u03b1)5/2\n\n(20)\n\nThe divergence at \u03b1 = \u22121 is cutoff by the first term in the exponent of the distribution F0,\u2206 (|\u03c9|, \u03b1) which leads to\nthe singular contribution at zero frequency:\nr\n2\n2 2\nvf q0\n(21)\nAsing (k, \u03c9) = (v\u2206 q0 )\u22121 e\u2212\u2206k /v\u2206 q0\n|\u03c9|\non the other hand, on the nodal line (\u2206k = 0) (18) simplifies to\n1\nA(k, \u03c9) = |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03be|\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03b1\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)1/2\nF\u03be,0 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03be, \u03b1)\n(1 + \u03b1)5/2\n\n(22)\n\nAgain the divergence of the integral is cut off by the distribution function.

The phase action S\u03b8 is taken to be strictly in 2d, rather than a layered system. This simplification\ndoes not change the results below, since the essential property of S\u03b8 is the linear 2d-like dispersion near the origin.\nAs we discussed in the paper, the full layered dispersion is nearly linear near the origin (except for a small gap at\nk = 0 due to the c-axis Josephson coupling, which is negligible at the temperatures of interest here).\nSI is the minimal coupling action of the fermions to the phase field, of which we keep only the most relevant term\nconsisting of a current-current coupling.\nWe will treat \u03bbSI perturbatively. The \"engineering\" scaling dimensions of the fields can be read off from the\nfixed point action with \u03bb = 0: [\u03a8j ] = \u22121, [\u03b8] = \u2212 21 . Therefore the scaling dimension of SI is found to be [SI ] =\n\u2212 12 + O (\u03bb), i.e. it is irrelevant in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that the coupling to longitudinal\nphase fluctuations does not change the low energy spectrum of the fermions. In particular, we can estimate the\nquasiparticle lifetime due to SI . To leading order, 1/\u03c4 (E) \u223c \u03bb2 . In order to determine the energy dependence, we\ncan perform an RG transformation that takes E to some fixed energy scale E0 > E. Under this transformation,\n\u2032\n\n\u03bb\u2192\u03bb =\n\n\u0012\n\nE0\nE\n\n\u0013\u2212 12 +O(\u03bb)\n\n\u03bb\n\n(28)\n\ntherefore\n1\n\u223c (\u03bb\u2032 )2 =\n\u03c4 (E0 )\n\n\u0012\n\nE0\nE\n\n\u0013\u22121+O(\u03bb)\n\n\u03bb2 .\n\n(29)\n\nNow, since 1/\u03c4 has units of energy, we can scale back to get\n1\nE\n1\n=\n\u223c\n\u03c4 (E)\nE0 \u03c4 (E0 )\n\n\u0012\n\nE\nE0\n\n\u00132\u2212O(\u03bb)\n\n\u03bb2\n\n(30)\n\nWe conclude that for weak coupling 1/\u03c4 (E) \u223c E 2 , and the low energy quasiparticles are well defined. A direct\nevaluation of the leading diagram for 1/\u03c4 (E) confirms this result.\nIII.\n\nCALCULATION OF THE TYPICAL CURRENT FLUCTUATION\n\nThe action for the transverse (vortex) part of the phase field in the 2d x \u2212 y model is the form of a Coulomb gas\nmodel, which can be mapped onto the Sine-Gordon model\n\nSSG =\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\n2y\n1 1\n(\u2207\u03b8)2 \u2212 2 cos [\u03b8 (x) + \u03bcv (x)]\nd x\n2 4\u03c0 2 K\n\u03bec\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n(31)\n\nHere \u03bcv is a vortex chemical potential term, that enables a calculation of vortex density correlations. In particular,\nthe typical current fluctuation is given by\nq02 = \u2207\u03c62\u22a5 (0) =\n\n4\u03c0 2 X hn (q) n (\u2212q)i\n\u03a9 q\nq2\n\n(32)\n\nwhere n (q) is the Fourier transformed vortex density. The vortex density correlation function in real space can be\nexpressed as:\nZ 2\nd x \u2212q*x\n1\ne\nhn (x) n (0)i\nhn (q) n (\u2212q)i = 2\n\u03bec\n\u03bec2\nhn (x) n (0)i = \u2212 (2y)2 hsin [\u03b8 (x)] sin [\u03b8 (0)]i + 2y\u03bec2 \u03b4 (x) hcos [\u03b8 (0)]i\n\n(33)\n\n\f9\nThe last line is obtained Rby taking \u03bcv derivatives of the Sine-Gordon partition function. Charge neutrality of the\nCoulomb gas model fixes d2 x hn (x) n (0)i = 0. Indeed, we see that otherwise q02 (which is proportional to the total\nelectostatic energy) diverges.\nIn order to calculate (33) in the gapped (disordered) phase, we use the self consistent harmonic approximation.\nThe action (31) is replaced by the quadratic action\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nm2 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n(34)\n(\u2207\u03b8) +\n\u03b8\nd x\nSSCHA =\n4\u03c0 2 K\n2\n2\nm is a variational parameter determined by minimizing the free energy of the system. The optimal value is m =\n\u03c0\n\u03bec\n\n1\n\u03c0K\n2\n\n(8yK) 2(1\u2212\n\n) . The calculation of (33) with the action (34) is strait forward, and yields\n2\n\n2\u03c0K\n\nhn (x) n (0)i0 = \u2212 (2y) (\u03bec m)\nsinh [2\u03c0Kf (m |x|)] + A\u03bec2 \u03b4 (x)\nZ\nd2 q eiq*x\nf (m |x|) =\n2\n2\n|q|< \u03be\u03c0 2\u03c0 q + m\n\n(35)\n\nc\n\nHere A = 2y hcos [\u03b8 (x\nR 1 )]i. Instead of calculating A directly, we will adjust it so that (35) satisfies the exact charge\nneutrality sum rule d2 x hn (x) n (0)i = 0. In the high temperature (K \u2192 0) limit, (35) reduces to the Debye-H\u00fcckel\nform.\nR 2 iq*x\nL\nPlugging (35) into (32) and using d2\u03c0q e q2 = ln |x|\n(where L is the system size, which is taken to infinity at the\nend of the calculation), we finally get\nq02 (T ) =\n\n(4\u03c0y)2\n2\u03c0K\n(\u03bec m)\n\u03bec2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u221e\n\ndrr ln r sinh [2\u03c0Kf (m\u03bec r)]\n\n(36)\n\n\f"}
