It makes sense, therefore, to recast results of microscopic calculations of such reactions in this language. Here we present the diffractive\nDIS \u03c13 production as a specific correction to the generalized vector dominance. We perform a coupled channel analysis of spin-orbital excitations in diffractive photoproduction\nand reiterate the point that \u03c13 in diffractive DIS will be sensitive to a novel aspect of\ndiffraction.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe study of photon-hadron collisions in 1960's was driven to large extent by the Vector\nDominance Model (VDM), the idea that the photon in such reactions behaves as a universal\ncombination of hadrons with the photon's quantum numbers, see review [1]. In its simplest\nform, one assumes that the \"hadronic part\" of a physical photon in a given isospin-flavor\nchannel is saturated by the ground state vector meson V contribution. If accompanied with\nthe assumption that the subsequent interaction of this meson is a one-channel process, it\nyields direct relations among the cross sections of different processes, such as \u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 V p),\n\u03c3tot (V p), and \u03c3tot (\u03b3p) as well as decay width \u0393(V \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ). Lifting some of these restrictions\nhas lead to Generalized Vector Dominance (GVD) models, which provided rather good overall\ndescription of the data on the medium energy photon-hadron interactions.\nThe advent of partonic description of high-energy reactions as well as a vast amount of\nnew data has set boundaries of the applicability of VDM/GVD. A particularly transparent\ninsight into the nature of vector dominance is offered by the color dipole approach [2] (see\nnext Section). Still, the physically appealing idea behind the vector dominance makes it an\ninteresting exercise to recast results of a microscopic theory in a VDM-like form. An example\nof such analysis was given in Ref. [3] where the photoproduction of the radially excited meson\n\u03c1(2S) off nuclei was found to be due to the off-diagonal transitions among different radial\n\u2217\n\nE-Mail: Igor.Ivanov@ulg.ac.be\n\n1\n\n\fexcitations in diffraction. In a more recent example, [4, 5], the GVD was used to study the\nnature of a narrow dip structure in the 6\u03c0 final state located near M6\u03c0 \u223c 1.9 GeV.\nIn this paper we discuss the recent results on diffractive \u03c13 production [6], obtained within\nthe kt -factorization approach, in the GVD language. The \u03c13 (1690) meson cannot couple\ndirectly to the photon and therefore it is absent in the annihilation e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 hadrons.\nBut it can be produced diffractively, since diffraction conserves only the P - and C-parities\nbut not the projectile spin J. Thus, \u03c13 production can be interpreted as a specific correction\nto the vector dominance model. With the coupled channel analysis we show that diffractive\nproduction of the D-wave spin-1 and spin-3 mesons of the \u03c1 system, despite having comparable\ncross sections, probe very different aspects of diffraction.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss relation between the (generalized)\nvector dominance models and the partonic description of diffraction. In Section 3 we argue that\nthe diffraction operator does not conserve the spin of the projectile nor the angular momentum\nof the q q\u0304 state, which represents the projectile in the first approximation. Production of \u03c13 ,\nthus, can be viewed as a result of the off-diagonal transitions between different hadronic states\nin diffraction. In Section 4 we note that such a correction to VDM might have already been\nobserved by the E687 experimentally. Possible nuclear effects and additional \"photophobic\"\nstates are discussed in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we draw our conclusions.\n\n2\n\n(Generalized) Vector Dominance and its limits\n\nLet us first remind the standard assumptions behind VDM and discuss the presence of excited\nmesons in the photon in this context.\nIn the original formulation, the physical photon is represented as a sum of a bare photon\nand of a \"hadronic\" part of the photon. Such decomposition is not Lorentz-invariant by itself,\nbecause what appears as a hadronic part of the photon in one frame of reference turns into\na hadronic fluctuation of a target in another. One usually chooses the target rest frame, and\nif the photon energy is large enough, this decomposition is well defined. It is the hadronic\npart of the photon that participate in hadronic processes, while the bare photon contributes\nnegligibly.\nThe hadronic part of the physical photon is represented as an integral over all possible\nasymptotic (in respect to strong interactions) hadronic states with photon's quantum numbers\nand with invariant mass M. At not too large masses, the dispersion integral over M is\nsaturated by the lowest resonances. Such contributions can then be defined as contributions\nof vector mesons. Limiting ourselves to the flavor-isospin sector that corresponds to the \u03c1\nmesons, one can rewrite the hadronic part of the (virtual) photon as\n|\u03b3 \u2217 (Q2 )ih =\n\nX\nV\n\ne\nm2V\n|V i .\nfV m2V + Q2\n\n(1)\n\nThe simplest VDM consists in assumption that only the ground state meson dominates in (1),\nwhich leads to\nm2\u03c1\ne\n|\u03b3 \u2217 ih =\n|\u03c1i .\nf\u03c1 m2\u03c1 + Q2\nThis assumption is often accompanied with an additional requirement that subsequent scattering process is diagonal in the space of states |V i in (1), and it then leads to direct relations\n2\n\n\famong various cross sections.\nThe presence of excited vector mesons in diffractive photoproduction calls to lifting the\nabove restrictions. In the Generalized Vector Dominance (GVD) model one accepts (1) as it\nis, and assumes further that the subsequent interaction can lead to off-diagonal transitions\namong vector mesons Vi \u2192 Vf .\n\n2.1\n\nGVD in the color dipole language\n\nThe origin of VDM/GVD success becomes transparent in the color dipole approach. It applies\nto the frame where projectile momentum is large, so that the transverse motion of partons\nis slowed down relativistically, and the fact that individual partons are not asymptotic states\nbecomes inessential. In a high-energy diffractive reaction, the scattering amplitude has form\nA(A \u2192 B) = hB|\u03c3\u0302|Ai, where diffractive states are represented as coherent combinations of\nmultipartonic Fock states:\nA\n|Ai = \u03a8A\n(2)\nq q\u0304 |q q\u0304i + \u03a8q q\u0304g |q q\u0304gi + . . .\nHere integration over all internal degrees of freedom assumed, and \u03c3\u0302 is the diffraction operator\nthan describes the diagonal scattering of these multiparton states in the impact parameter\nrepresentation. Switching from the basis of multipartonic states to the basis of physical mesons\n{|Vi i} and assuming completeness, one can recover (1).\nDue to the lowest Fock state domination, the diffraction operator is based on the color\ndipole cross section \u03c3dip (~r) of a q q\u0304 pair with transverse separation ~r. The transition amplitude\nis represented as\nZ\nA(A \u2192 B) = dzd2~r \u03a8B\u2217\nr )\u03c3dip (~r)\u03a8A\nr) ,\n(3)\nq q\u0304 (z, ~\nq q\u0304 (z, ~\n\nwhere z is the quark's fraction of the lightcone momentum of particle A.\nThe origin of the VDM success in reactions where A is the hadronic part of the photon\nlies in the fact that the typical wave functions of the ground state vector meson used in\nphenomenology are very similar to the transverse photon lightcone wave function at small Q2 .\nAs virtuality Q2 grows, the q q\u0304 wave function of the photon shrinks, while the color dipole\ncross section behaves as \u03c3dip \u221d r 2 at small r and reaches a plateau at large r. As a result, the\nfunction under integral (3),\nA \u2261 \u03b3 \u2217 and B is a ground state vector meson, peaks at the\n\u221a where\nscanning radius rS \u223c 6/ Q2 + M 2 , see Ref. [7]. At small Q2 the typical scanning radius is\nlarge, and the amplitude is roughly proportional to the integration measure\nA(\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 V ) \u221d rS2 \u221d\n\n(Q2\n\n1\n,\n+ M 2)\n\nwhich mimics the VDM behavior. At larger Q2 the scanning radius becomes small enough and\nthe diffraction cross section itself decreases. This phenomenon of color transparency produces\na more rapid decrease A(\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 V ) \u221d 1/(Q2 + M 2 )2 up to logarithmic factors, [2, 7].\n\n2.2\n\nPresence of excited vector mesons in the photon\n\nThe behavior just described can be cast in the GVD language involving radial excitations [3].\nAt large Q2 , the (small) photon must be represented as a coherent combination of a large\n\n3\n\n\fnumber of (big) radially excited states. Representing the diffractive production amplitude of\na final meson V as\nA(\u03b3 \u2217 (Q2 ) \u2192 V ) =\n\nX\n\nci (Q2 )\n\nMi2\nA(Vi \u2192 V ) ,\nQ2 + Mi2\n\none sees that each term in this expansion decreases with Q2 growth as \u221d 1/(Q2 + Mi2 ).\nHowever, coefficients ci (Q2 ) must behave in such a way that cancellations among the terms\nmakes the overall Q2 -dependence of A(\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 V ) is \u221d 1/(Q2 + Mi2 )2 , in accordance with color\ndipole result.\nNote that similar arguments must be at work for the large-M photoproduction, when\none studies the large-mass tail of broad resonances in a given (for example, multipion) final\nstate. Production of a multipion state with invariant mass Mn\u03c0 significantly larger than the\nnominal mass of the vector meson must involve q q\u0304 pairs with larger invariant mass, and smaller\ntransverse separation, than for the vector meson at peak. In the color dipole approach this\neffect can be roughly accounted for by an additional correction factor\nF (Mn\u03c0 ) =\n\n\u03c3dip (rS (Mn\u03c0 ))\n\u03c3dip (rS (MV ))\n\n(4)\n\nin the amplitude. In the VDM language the same correction must be implemented as an\nadditional Mn\u03c0 -dependence of the \u03c3(V p \u2192 V p).\nAnother correction to VDM is related to the spinorial structure of the hadron's coupling to\nthe q q\u0304 state, implicitly present in (2) in the definition of \u03a8A\nq q\u0304 . According to QED, the photon\n\u03bc\ncouples to the q q\u0304 pair as \u016b\u03b3 u, but the corresponding coupling of a vector meson depends on\nq q\u0304 angular momentum inside the meson. For the pure S-wave and pure D-wave vector mesons\nthe structures \u016b\u0393\u03bc u are [8]:\n\u0393\u03bcS = \u03b3 \u03bc +\n\n2p\u03bc\n,\nM + 2m\n\n\u0393\u03bcD = \u03b3 \u03bc \u2212\n\n4(M + m)p\u03bc\n.\nM 2 \u2212 4m2\n\n(5)\n\nThus, the photon coupling represents a specific form of S-wave/D-wave mixing:\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8(q q\u0304) = \u0393\u03bcS \u03a8S (q q\u0304) + \u0393\u03bcD \u03a8D (q q\u0304) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith appropriately normalized \u03a8S (q q\u0304) and \u03a8D (q q\u0304). Since the D-wave vector meson can be\napproximated by the q q\u0304 pair in the L = 2 state, this proves that decomposition (1) must\ninclude orbitally excited vector mesons as well. The partial width \u0393(\u03c1\u2032\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) is known\nvery poorly, [9], which gives us only very rough estimate 1/f\u03c1\u2032\u2032 \u223c 0.2(1/f\u03c1 ), which gives a 20%\ncontribution of the D-wave meson in (1). This value, however, supports the argument that\nthe origin of D-wave state here is the quarks' Fermi motion.\nThere are two competing mechanisms for diffractive production of the orbitally excited\nvector mesons. First, the D-wave component of the photon in (6) can get \"actuated\" via\ndiagonal scattering off the target. The other mechanism involves off-diagonal transition of\nthe S-wave part of (6) into the D-wave vector meson under the action of diffraction operator.\nThe kt -factorization analysis of [10] did not specify which mechanism was the dominant. The\ncoupled channel analysis presented in the following Section will help find the answer.\nThe same off-diagonal transitions that break the q q\u0304 angular momentum conservation and\nproduce a D-wave vector meson can also produce its spin-orbital partner, the D-wave spin-3\n4\n\n\fmeson. Analysis of [6] in the case of \u03c13 (1690) showed that its production rate is expected to be\nonly 2\u00f73 times smaller than production rate of \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700), which is believed to be predominantly\nD-wave vector meson. The hadronic part of the photon does not include the spin-3 meson, so\nit arises exclusively due to the off-diagonal properties of the diffraction operator.\n\n3\n\nCoupled channel analysis of the orbital excitations in\ndiffraction\n\nTo get the GVD-like interpretation of the \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700) and \u03c13 (1690) production, we perform a\ncoupled channel analysis of the action of diffraction operator in Fock subspace generated by\nthree states in the \u03c1 system: the ground state meson \u03c1(770), which we identify with the pure\n1S state, the excited vector meson \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700), which we identify with a purely orbital excitation\nwith L = 2, and the spin-3 meson \u03c13 (1690), which is also assumed to be in the L = 2 state.\nFor numerical calculation of the transitions among these states in diffraction, we use the\ncolor dipole/kt -factorization representation of the production amplitude. The dipole cross\nsection is expressed in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution, whose fits were taken\nfrom [11] and adapted for the off-forward kinematics according to the procedure described in\n[12]. The wave functions for the mesons were parametrized in the same way as in [10] and\n[6]. Note that the radial wave functions of the three mesons considered do not have nodes.\nTherefore transitions from these states to radially excited states (i.e. transitions away from\nthis subspace) are weak.\nWe limit ourselves to the photoproduction (Q2 = 0) and present cross sections \u03c3ji \u2261 hj|\u03c3\u0302|ii\nof transitions of an initial state i with a given transverse polarization into final state j with\nvarious polarization states. The analytical expressions for the helicity amplitudes were derived\naccording to the standard diagram evaluation, see details in Appendix.\nWe start with the forward scattering, d\u03c3ji /dt|t=0 . In this case the strict s-channel helicity\nconservation (SCHC) takes place, and we are interested in transitions among transversely\npolarized states of \u03c1, \u03c1D and \u03c13 . The calculations yield the following matrix d\u03c3ji /dt at t = 0\nd\u03c3ji\n|t=0\ndt\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n250 1.5 0.3\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ed 1.5 460 1.3 \uf8f8 mb*GeV\u22122 .\n0.3 1.3 270\n\n(7)\n\nThe off-diagonal values are non-zero, but stay small, which means that both total spin J\nand the q q\u0304 angular momentum L are not strictly conserved during diffraction. We underline\nthat the accuracy of our numerical results is low; our calculations are plagued both by the\nlarge uncertainties of the wave function parametrizations and of the experimental values of\n\u0393(\u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700) \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ), which was used to fix the free parameters of the \u03c1D and \u03c13 wave functions.\nThe off-diagonal elements in (7) show only the order of magnitude of the effect; the error by\na factor of 2\u20133 can be present. The accuracy for the diagonal elements is somewhat higher,\nroughly within \u223c 50%.\nTo obtain the integrated cross sections, we calculate d\u03c3ji /dt at non-zero t and integrate\nit within the region |t| < 1 GeV2 . On passing to the non-forward cross sections, we must\ninclude the helicity amplitudes transition that violate SCHC. Such transitions give marginal\ncontributions to the L-conserving diagonal transitions, but they are expected to be more\n5\n\n\fimportant in the off-diagonal cases. In particular, results of [6] suggest that the \u03c13 production\nat small Q2 can be even dominated by the helicity violating transitions.\nStrictly speaking, in the non-forward case the diffraction operator acts in the 3+3+7 = 13dimensional space of all helicity states of these three mesons. To simplify presentation, we\nshow below the sum of cross sections of transitions from a given transversely polarized initial\nstate to a final state with all possible helicities, which will make the transition matrix nonsymmetric. The result of numerical integration is:\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n19 1 0.2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03c3ji = \uf8ed 1 27 0.3 \uf8f8 mb .\n1.3 0.4 19\n\n(8)\n\nCalculation showed that the diagonal elements are mostly due to helicity conserving transitions, while the off-diagonal elements receive very large contributions from helicity violating\ntransitions, in agreement with expectations. Note very large difference between \u03c3(\u03c1S \u2192 \u03c13 )\nand \u03c3(\u03c13 \u2192 \u03c1S ), which also confirms domination of helicity violating transitions in \u03c13 production.\n\n3.1\n\nDifference in diffractive \u03c1D and \u03c13 production\n\nIn order to understand the differences between photoproduction of \u03c1D and \u03c13 , consider the\ninitial photon as a vector in the subspace we consider. According to the discussion in Sect. 2.2,\nit can be represented roughly as |\u03b3i \u223c |\u03c1S i + 0.2|\u03c1D i. One sees that direct \"materialization\"\nof the D-wave component of the photon followed by its diagonal scattering has much larger\namplitude than the L-changing transition from the S-wave component (0.2 * 27 vs. 1).\nOn the other hand, the \u03c13 must appear in diffraction via the off-diagonal L- and J-violating\nelements of the diffraction operator (8). Thus, in contrast to the \u03c1D , the \u03c13 production probes\na novel aspect of diffraction.\n\n4\n\nComparison between the 4\u03c0 BaBar ISR and E687 data\n\nIn this section we discuss if the corrections to the GVD due to \u03c13 might have been already\nobserved in experiment.\nThe dominant decay channel of \u03c13 is 4\u03c0 with branching ratio BR(\u03c13 \u2192 4\u03c0) = 73%. Thus\none can look for its presence in diffractive photoproduction by comparing the rescaled E687\ndata [13] with BaBar initial state radiation (ISR) data [14] in 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) final state.\nUsing GVD accompanied with the assumption that the diffraction operator is diagonal,\none obtains the following relation between the 4\u03c0 spectra in the e+ e\u2212 annihilation and photoproduction:\n1 d\u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 4\u03c0p)\n\u221d \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4\u03c0) .\n(9)\n2\nM4\u03c0\ndM4\u03c0\nThe presence of \u03c13 in diffraction should manifest itself as a bump in the photoproduction\nspectrum around M4\u03c0 \u223c 1.7 GeV. If the above ideas of the dominance of SCHC violation in\n\u03c13 are correct, one will see a larger bump at higher values of |t|.\nIn Fig. 1 we present the 4\u03c0 spectrum in e+ e\u2212 annihilation obtained by BaBar and the\ndiffractive photoproduction cross section from E687 modified according to (9). The relative\n6\n\n\fnormalization of the two data sets is adjusted manually for a better comparison of the resonance peaks.\nThere are three regions where deviations are seen. At M4\u03c0 \u2248 1.5 GeV the BaBar data are\nsignificantly higher and at M4\u03c0 \u223c 1.7 \u00f7 1.8 GeV are somewhat lower than the rescaled E687\ndata. At M4\u03c0 > 2 GeV the BaBar data again take over. This region (zoomed in at the right\nplot of Fig. 1) seems the most disturbing, not only because the ratio between the two data\nsets here is large, but also because it increases with the M4\u03c0 rise.\n35\n\n3\n\n30\n\n2.5\n\n25\n2\n20\n1.5\n15\n1\n10\n0.5\n\n5\n0\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n0\n\n2.4\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\n2\nFigure 1: Comparison between the BaBar data and the E687 data weighted with 1/M4\u03c0\nfactor\nin the resonance region, left, and in the high mass region, right.\n\n35\n\n3\n\n30\n\n2.5\n\n25\n2\n20\n1.5\n15\n1\n10\n0.5\n\n5\n0\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n0\n\n2.4\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\nFigure 2: The same as in Fig. 1 but with the E687 data additionally corrected with the\nformfactor (10).\nWe argue that this high-mass discrepancy is an artefact of the naive VDM used in comparison (9). As discussed above, diffractive production of high mass multipion states are\n7\n\n\fadditionally suppressed in comparison with (9) by the factor (4). In a phenomenological analysis, this bias can be compensated by dividing the photoproduction data by the square of the\ncorrection factor (4). We used the well-known Golec-Biernat-W\u00fcsthoff saturation model [15]\nfor the color dipole cross section \u03c3(r) = \u03c30 [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212r 2 /R2 (x))] and divided E687 data by the\nadditional compensation factor\n10 GeV2\nF (M4\u03c0 ) = 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n2\nM4\u03c0\n\"\n\n#!2\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nand then readjusted the overall normalization.\nFigure 2 shows the results. The simple factor (10) makes the two data sets nearly identical\nin the entire high-mass range shown, M4\u03c0 = 2.0\u20133.9 GeV. In the resonance region, the balance\nbetween the two experiments changes. One sees a more prominent domination of the E687\ndata over the BaBar data in the range of M4\u03c0 \u223c 1.6 \u00f7 1.9 GeV, while the difference around\nM4\u03c0 \u2248 1.5 GeV becomes less pronounced.\nWith these data sets only, one cannot draw a definitive conclusion about the origin of the\nbroad 1.6\u20131.9 GeV peak seen in the difference of the data sets. It can be due to enhanced\nproduction of \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700) or due to the presence of \u03c13 in photoproduction. If one assumes that\nits is entirely due to the presence of \u03c13 , one can roughly estimate its production rate,\n\u03c3(\u03c13 )/\u03c3(\u03c1\u2032 + \u03c1\u2032\u2032 ) \u223c 0.05 \u00f7 0.1 .\n\n(11)\n\nThis number appears to be in agreement both with the old OMEGA result [16] and with\ncalculations of [6]. We do not plunge here into a detail systematic analysis of the difference of\nthe two data sets, but just state that it is worth studying further.\nThe easiest way to resolve the ambiguity in the origin of the enhancement would be to\nmeasure the same photoproduction spectrum at larger values of |t| up to 1 GeV2 . If \u03c13\nphotoproduction is indeed dominated by the helicity-flip amplitudes, as argued in [6], its\ncontribution should rapidly grow with |t|.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDiscussion\nNuclear effects\n\nA place where corrections to the naive VDM come to the foreground is diffractive production of\nexcited mesons off nuclei. In this case the diffractive system can experience multiple scattering\noff separate nucleons, which amounts to multiple action of the diffraction operator on the initial\nstate. Such action enhances the rate of production of excited states that were initially (almost)\northogonal to the photon. The fingerprints of this effect in experiment would be an observation\nof an A-dependence of the relative production rate of excited states, the modifications of the\nshape of these resonances and, possibly, novel interference patterns inside the nucleus.\nSuch in-medium modifications of the properties of the radially excited \u03c1 states were explored in [3]. Even at moderate energies the shape of the \u03c1(2S) state was noticeably distorted in heavy nuclei. The origin of this effect was traced back to non-trivial interplay\nbetween two production mechanisms: direct production \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1(2S) and sequential transition\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1(1S) \u2192 \u03c1(2S). The latter transition is precisely due to the off-diagonal matrix element\nof the diffraction operator.\n8\n\n\fSimilar effects are expected to take place in the orbitally excited sector of the diffractive\nstates. In order to observe better the \u03c13 , one must focus not at the forward production, but\n2\nat the entire region |t| <\n\u223c 1 GeV . As was discussed above, the \u03c13 production is exclusively\ndue to the off-diagonal matrix elements of the diffraction operator. Besides, according to (8),\ntransitions from \u03c13 back to the \u03c1S are less probable than the \u03c1S \u2192 \u03c13 transitions. All this\nproduces a persistent \"flux\" towards the \u03c13 state, and its presence is enhanced upon each\nsuccessive rescattering.\nNote in addition, that production of \u03c13 in a given helicity state can proceed via many\ndifferent helicity sequences, such as \u03c1S (\u03bbS ) \u2192 \u03c13 (\u03bb\u20323 ) \u2192 \u03c13 (\u03bb3 ). All of them will interfere and\nmight produce nontrivial patterns.\n\n5.2\n\nPhotophobic states in diffraction\n\nThe \u03c13 is a state whose direct coupling to the photon is zero (\"photophobic\" state), yet\nit appears among diffractive states due to the off-diagonal transition. Similarly, one might\nexpect that other hadrons not coupled directly to the photon might show up in diffraction.\nOne interesting example is a hybrid meson. Phenomenologically, one often treats the hybrid\n(vector) meson as a state that does not couple directly to the photon, but it can reappear\nin photon's Fock state decomposition via hadronic loops and intermediate transitions to the\nnonexotic mesons. An analysis of this type was performed in [4, 5]. There, such a cryptoexotic\nstate was assumed to couple to \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700) but not to the photon. This simple model was\nproposed to explain the narrow dip structure in the 6\u03c0 final state around M6\u03c0 = 1.9 GeV\nobserved both in diffractive photoproduction [17] and in e+ e\u2212 annihilation [14].\nThe present coupled channel analysis seems to be a more adequate framework for the\nanalysis of possible interference effects of such photophobic states in diffraction. What one\nneeds in order to get concrete predictions is a (phenomenological) microscopic model for such\na state. Such an analysis would be complementary to that of [4, 5], since in these works\nthe diffraction operator was assumed to be diagonal, while we show that this assumption is\nunwarranted. It would be interesting to see how non-diagonal transitions of the diffraction\noperator influence the results of [4, 5].\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nSince the vector dominance idea is still used these days to understand some features of new\nexperimental results, it is useful to discuss the results of microscopic QCD calculations in the\nlanguage of the generalized vector dominance models. In this paper, we argued that the vector\ndominance model, when applied to the region M \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2.0 GeV, must receive significant\ncorrections due to presence of the \u03c13 among diffractive states.\nWe compared the paths that lead to diffractive production of \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700), which is believed\nto be a D-wave vector meson, and of \u03c13 (1690), its spin-orbital partner. Recent kt -factorization\nresults [6] show that their cross sections should be comparable. However, the coupled channel\nanalysis performed here gives strong evidence that these two processes probe very different aspects of the diffraction. The \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (1700) production can be viewed primarily as \"materialization\"\nof the D-wave component of the photon followed by diagonal diffractive scattering, while the\n\u03c13 production probes exclusively the off-diagonal elements of the diffraction operator. Thus,\n9\n\n\fwith \u03c13 one can study novel aspects of diffraction.\nWe also compared recent E687 and ISR BaBar data on 4\u03c0 spectra obtained in diffraction\nand e+ e\u2212 annihilation, respectively, and observed an enhancement in the photoproduction\nprecisely where \u03c13 resides. At present it is not known if this enhancement is due to excited\nvector mesons or to the \u03c13 , but studies at non-zero momentum transfer t might provide the\nanswer.\nFinally, we discussed the role of orbital excitations in photon-nuclear collisions, and argued\nthat the coupled channel analysis might help study other \"photophobic\" states.\nAcknowledgements.
