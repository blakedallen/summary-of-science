Primary physics goal is the search for axion like particles in a photon regeneration experiment. Central part of the experimental setup is a five Tesla strong superconducting HERA dipole magnet. During two operation periods in the years 2007 and\n2008 we have collected first data and explored the sensitivity of the setup. A Fabry Perot\nlaser cavity is being set up in order to increase the sensitivity by more than one order of\nmagnitude.\n\n1\n\nPhysics Motivation and Goals of ALPS\n\nOne of the most exciting quest in particle physics is the search for new particles beyond the\nstandard model. Extensions of the standard model predict not only new particles with masses\nabove the electroweak scale (\u223c 100 GeV) but also the so called WISPs (Weakly Interacting\nSub-eV Particles). Several possible candidates are axions [1] or axion like particles (ALPs),\nlight spin 1 particles called \"hidden sector photons\" [2] or light minicharged particles [3]. For a\nsummary on their role in physics beyond the standard model see the contributions of J. Jaeckel\nand A. Ringwald to these proceedings [4]. It is certainly an important and fundamental question\nwhether any of these light particles exist. Unfortunately, the predictions for the masses and\ncouplings of WISPs are typically not precise and extensive searches in broad parameter spaces\nhave to be performed. Of course, any experimental measurement which gives new indications or\nnew limitations is highly welcome. Nowadays, the strongest constraints come from astrophysical and cosmological arguments (see the contribution of J. Redondo in these proceedings [5])\nand from dedicated laboratory experiments [6]. Very recently, the observations of PVLAS [7]\ntriggered the interest, exploration and setup of new low energy experiments using high photon\nfluxes combined with strong electromagnetic fields.\nThe ALPS experiment, located at DESY in Hamburg, uses a spare superconducting HERA\ndipole magnet and a strong laser beam for \"Axion Like Particle Search\". In fact, the experiment has also a large sensitivity for other WISPs so the acronym ALPS should stand more\nprecisely for \"Any Light Particle Search\". The primary goal is the indirect detection of a\nlight ALP in a \"light shining through a wall\" (LSW) experiment [8]. A small fraction of the\nincident photons from our laser can convert to ALPs \u03c6 in the presence of the magnetic field by\nthe so-called Primakoff effect [9]. Being \u03c6s very weakly interacting with ordinary matter, they\ncross light-tight walls without significant absorption. Behind the absorber, some of these ALPs\nwill reconvert via the inverse-Primakoff process into photons with the initial properties.\nThe probability of the Primakoff transition P\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 is the same than for the inverse-Primakoff\nP\u03c6\u2192\u03b3 in the ALPs symmetric setup. Therefore the LSW probability is just the square of\nPatras 2008\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: Photo of the ALPS Experiment, showing the laser hut, the superconducting magnet\nand the cabinet housing the detector setup.\nP\u03b3\u2192\u03c6 = g 2 B 2 E 2 /(4m4\u03c6 ) sin2 m2\u03c6 L/(4E) with B the magnetic field strength, L the length of the\nconversion region and E the photon energy. The ALP parameters: mass (m\u03c6 ) and two photon\ncoupling (g) are assumed to be unrelated (see [4] for the relevant definitions).\nThe transition probability is maximal in the limit m2\u03c6 /E \u2192 0 where it is coherent along\nthe full length, reaching g 2 B 2 L2 /4. The mass reach of the experiment is determined therefore\nby E through the coherence condition m2\u03c6 < 2\u03c0E/L. The polarization of the beam allows to\ndistinguish between scalar and pseudo scalar ALPs.\nAfter the submission of the Letter of Intent [10] the ALPS experiment was approved by the\nDESY directorate in January 2007. The ALPS collaboration comprises also the Laser Zentrum\nHannover (LZH), the Hamburg observatory (HO) and the Albert Einstein Institute(AEI).\n\n2\n\nThe Experimental Setup\n\nThe ALPS experiment is built up around the HERA dipole which features a field B = 5.16 T\nand a length of 8.42 m, cf. Fig. 1. Its beam pipe is bent with a remaining clear aperture of\nonly 18 mm, which implies serious demands on the beam quality of the laser. The interior\nis insulated against the cold part of the magnet, allowing to perform the experiment at room\ntemperature. In order to keep the temperature stable the beam pipe is flushed with nitrogen.\nInside the dipole beam pipe we place two further tubes which bound the \u03b3 \u2212 \u03c6 conversion\nand reconversion regions and are operated under vacuum conditions. This is crucial since an\nindex of refraction n > 1 suppresses the conversion probabilities [11]. Both tubes range from\neither side approximately to the middle of the magnet and can be easily removed. A removable\nlight-tight absorber wall is mounted on the inner end of the detector tube while an adjustable\nmirror is attached to the inner side of the laser tube, cf. Fig. 2, because dissipating the high\nlaser power inside the magnet could produce dangerous quenches of the magnet. On both sides\nof the laser tube there are vacuum sealed windows. Custom made pico-motors based on piezo\nactuators allow a very precise remote adjustment of the inner mirror within the strong magnetic\nfield. This was a very important precondition for the later setup of a laser cavity inside the\nsuperconducting magnet.\n2\n\nPatras 2008\n\n\fFigure 2: Adjustable mirror with custom made pico-motors attached to the laser tube.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Laser\n\nThe laser setup, built on an solid optical table inside our laser hut, allows to adjust the intensity\nand the polarization of the beam. A low intensity reference beam is guided in a beam tube\noutside the magnet parallel to the main beam to the detector setup. Due to the small aperture\nof the magnet and the requirement to focus the beam on a few pixels of the used camera a\nsmall laser beam width with a very good beam quality factor M 2 \u223c 1 is required. Both, the\nbeam divergence \u03b8 and the minimal spot size \u03c3min are proportional to M 2 .\nThere exist high power infrared lasers but the demanding request on the beam quality\nexcludes many industry devices. Furthermore, it is a challenging enterprise to get affordable\nhigh efficient and low noise detectors for infrared photons. In summer 2007 we setup the\nexperiment with a 3.5 W Verdi-Coherent CW green laser with \u03bb = 532 nm and M 2 < 1.1 and\na commercial camera with good efficiency for green light. Based on the experience of a test run\nin autumn 2007 we abandoned the initial plan to use an infrared laser.\nBy the end of the year 2007 we setup and operated successfully a LIGO type pulsed laser\nsystem [12] with a pulse-length of 15 nsec and a repetition rate of 20 kHz. The system delivered\n14 W of green laser light, which corresponds to a photon flux of 4 *1019 s\u22121 . During an extensive\ncommissioning phase in spring 2008 we operated the complete setup and explored its sensitivity\n(details are discussed later on). Based on this experience, it became clear that we had to increase\nthe photon flux by one order of magnitude to become competitive with other experiments and\nto reach a sensitivity which allows the exploration of yet untouched areas in the parameter\nphase space of ALPs (cf. Fig. 3). Together with our new collaborators from the AEI we setup\na resonant optical cavity in the first half of the HERA magnet. An enhanced LIGO (eLIGO)\nlaser, developed at the LZH for gravitational experiments delivers 35 W 1064 nm laser light\nwith excellent beam characteristics. This is converted into 532 nm green laser light and fed into\nthe 8.62 m long cavity, which is bounded by the outer mirror, mounted on the optical table\ninside the laser hut, and the mirror at the inner end of the laser beam tube cf. Fig. 2.\nThe resonant cavity is locked by adopting the frequency of the eLIGO laser to compensate the length fluctuations of the setup. It was a major success and very important proof of\nprinciple, that the cavity could be locked over days and operates stable also when the magnet\nis powered. Recently we studied details of this ambitious setup in order to improve the performance and to exploit the full capability. Two major upgrade steps are under preparation:\na second resonant laser cavity around the frequency doubling crystal and the inclusion of the\nouter mirror into the cavity vacuum system. You may find several details concerning the laser\nsetup and cavity in the contributions of M. Hildebrand to these proceedings[13].\nPatras 2008\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nDetector\n\nAs photon detector we used so far the commercial astronomy CCD camera SBIG ST-402ME\nwith 765 \u2217 510 9 \u03bcm \u00d7 9 \u03bcm pixels and a quantum efficiency of 60% for \u03bb = 532 nm. We\noperate the camera at \u22125 C. It has a low dark current and a small readout noise of 17 e\u2212 . The\ncamera allows sampling times between 0.04 s and 1 h. The beam is focused on a small area\n\u2248 10 \u03bcm, i.e. a few pixels.\nIn order to improve the sensitivity we ordered the camera PIXIS 1024-BL (Princeton Instruments) with a quantum efficiency of 95 % for \u03bb = 532 m. This camera operates at \u221270 C,\nfeaturing a lower dark current of 0.001 e\u2212 pixel\u22121 s\u22121 and a readout noise of less than 4 e\u2212 .\nThe camera was delivered by the end of August and its performance is now under investigation.\n\n3\n\nCommissioning Run 2008 & Exploration of Sensitivity\n\nDuring the commissioning run in spring 2008 we used the 14 W LIGO laser and the SBIG\ncamera to collect around 100 h of data with magnet and laser on. The magnet, the camera\nand the laser worked very reliably. In order to minimize the impact of readout noise we used\na sampling time of 20 min or one hour. The absorber was removed a few times in order to\ntest the alignment. Unfortunately the front and back surfaces of the mirror inside the magnet\nwere not sufficiently parallel, causing a deflection of the light passing the mirror used for the\nalignment of the setup. This limits the knowledge of the beam spot, i.e. the position of potential\nre-converted photons on the CCD and prohibits to use the data for real physics. The troubling\nmirror was immediately replaced.\nThe acquired data were nevertheless used to go through the complete data analysis chain.\nAround 10 % of the frames are rejected by visual inspection because they contain intense tracks\n(likely from ambient radioactivity or cosmics) close to the signal region. As measurement we use\nthe sum of the pixel values in a 3 \u00d7 3 array around the beam spot region. After the correction of\nbaseline shifts, which are presumably correlated with varying temperatures of the surroundings,\nthe remaining fluctuations corresponds to the expectations of uncorrelated dark currents and\nthe read-out noise of the individual pixels. The classification of data depends on the physics.\nData with magnet on and vertical (horizontal) laser polarization are signals for pseudo-scalar\n(scalar) ALPs. All other data including dark frames are background. The final observable is\nthe difference in the mean of the distribution of many signal measurements to the mean of the\ndistribution of many background measurements. We see no signal, i.e. no significant difference\nbetween signal and background distributions.\nTaking into account the conversion factors and a conservative estimate for the efficiencies\nthe sensitivity for the reconverted photon flux is around 40 mHz. This leads together with the\ninitial laser photon flux of 4 * 1019 \u03b3/s to a detection probability P\u03b3\u2192\u03c6\u2192\u03b3 \u2248 10\u221221 . The deduced\nsensitivity in the ALP and in the \"hidden sector photon\" parameter space is plotted in Fig. 3.\n\n4\n\nOutlook\n\nExploiting the two major improvements of the setup which are under preparation, the resonant\ncavity and a high performance camera, increases the sensitivity of the setup by nearly one order\nof magnitude. The lower curves in Fig. 3 show the expected ALPS sensitivity with 300 W of\ngreen laser light and this together with the additional improved detector. We expect to have\n4\n\nPatras 2008\n\n\fthe improved setup by the end of the year in operation, allowing us to explore yet untouched\nareas in the parameter space of the low energy frontier.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe ALPS collaboration gratefully acknowledges the large interest and great support of many\nDESY groups for our activities.
