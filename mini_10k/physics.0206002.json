In the former type of machines\nit results in emittances that continually increase with time;\nin the latter type, in steady-state emittances that are larger\nthan those given by quantum excitation/synchrotron radiation alone.\nThe theory of intrabeam scattering for accelerators was\nfirst developed by Piwinski[4], a result that was extended\nby Martini[5], to give a formulation that we call here the\nstandard Piwinski (P) method[6]; this was followed by\nthe equally detailed Bjorken and Mtingwa (B-M) result[7].\nBoth approaches solve the local, two-particle Coulomb\nscattering problem for (six-dimensional) Gaussian, uncoupled beams, but the two results appear to be different; of the\ntwo, the B-M result is thought to be the more general[8].\nFor both the P and the B-M methods solving for the\nIBS growth rates is time consuming, involving, at each\ntime (or iteration) step, a numerical integration at every\nlattice element. Therefore, simpler, more approximate\nformulations of IBS have been developed over the years:\nthere are approximate solutions of Parzen[9], Le Duff[10],\nRaubenheimer[11], and Wei[12]. In the present report we\nderive-starting with the general B-M formalism-another\napproximation, one valid for high energy beams and more\naccurate than Raubenheimer's approximation. We, in addition, demonstrate that under these same conditions a modified version of Piwinski's IBS formulation asymptotically\nbecomes equal to this result.\n\n2\n\n1/2\n\n1 d\u01ebx\n1\n= 1/2\n,\nTx\ndt\n\u01ebx\n\nwhere i represents p, x, or y;\nA=\n\nr02 cN\n3\n2\n64\u03c0 \u03b2\u0304 \u03b3 4 \u01ebx \u01eby \u03c3s \u03c3p\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwith r0 the classical particle radius, c the speed of light, N\nthe bunch population, \u03b2\u0304 the velocity over c, \u03b3 the Lorentz\nenergy factor, and \u03c3s the bunch length; (log) represents\nthe Coulomb log factor, hi means that the enclosed quantities, combinations of beam parameters and lattice properties, are averaged around the entire ring; det and T r signify, respectively, the determinant and the trace of a matrix,\nand I is the unit matrix.

The example is the ATF ring with no coupling; to generate vertical errors, magnets were randomly\noffset by 15 \u03bcm, and the closed orbit was found. For this\nexample hHy i = 17 \u03bcm, yielding a zero-current emittance\nratio of 0.7%; the beam current is 3.1 mA. The steady-state\ngrowth rates according to the 3 methods are given in Table 2. We note that the Piwinski results are 4.5% low, and\nthe results of Eqs. 11,14, agree very well with those of BM. Additionally, note that, not only the (averaged) growth\nrates, but even the local growth rates around the ring agree\nwell for the three cases. Finally, note that for coupling\ndominated NLC, ALS examples (\u03ba = 0.5%, see Table 1)\nthe error in the steady-state growth rates (Tp\u22121 ,Tx\u22121 ) obtained with the model is (12%,2%), (7%,0%), respectively.\n\nQ2 = b\u03032 + (1 \u2212 b\u03032 )u2 . (19)\n\nThe parameter d functions as a maximum impact parameter, and is normally taken as the vertical beam size.\n\n3.2\n\nComparison of Modified Piwinski to the BM Solution at High Energies\n\nWe note that Piwinski's result depends on \u03b7 2 /\u03b2, and not\non H and \u03c6, as the B-M result does. This may suffice for\nrings with hHi \u2248 h\u03b7 2 /\u03b2i. For a general comparison, however, let us consider a formulation that we call the modified\nPiwinski solution. It is the standard version of Piwinski,\nbut with \u03b7 2 /\u03b2 replaced by H (i.e. \u00e3, b\u0303, \u03c3h , become a, b,\n\u03c3H , respectively).\nLet us consider high energy beams, i.e. let a,b \u226a 1:\nFirst, notice that in the integral of the auxiliary function f\n(Eq. 18): the \u22120.577 can be replaced by 0; the \u22123u2 in\nthe\n\u221a numerator\n\u221a can be set to 0; P (Q) can be replaced by\na2 + u2 ( b2 + u2 ). The first term in the braces can be\napproximated by a constant and then be pulled out of the\nintegral; it becomes the effective Coulomb log factor. Note\nthat for the proper choice of the Piwinski parameter d, the\neffective Coulomb log can be made the same as the B-M\nparameter (log). For flat beams (a \u226a b), the Coulomb log\n2\nof Piwinski becomes (log) = ln [d\u03c3H\n/(4r0 a2 )].\nWe finally obtain, for the first of Eqs. 15,\n\nTable 2: Steady-state IBS growth rates (in [s\u22121 ]) for an\nATF example with vertical dispersion due to random errors.\nMethod\n1/Tp 1/Tx 1/Ty\nModified Piwinski 25.9 24.7\n18.5\nBjorken-Mtingwa\n27.0 26.0\n19.4\nEqs. 11,14\n27.4 26.0\n19.4\nThe author thanks A.
