We now know that radio loud sources have a\nhigh incidence of dust in their central regions (e.g., de Koff et al. 2000) and\nthat there are several correlations between the properties of the dust and those\nof the radio source. However, this same dust has hampered the study of the\nnuclear regions of radio galaxies, particularly since most of the high resolution\nimaging studies of the hosts have been carried out at optical wavelengths.\nWe are conducting a Keck and Lick adaptive optics (AO) imaging and spectroscopic survey of nearby radio galaxies and other AGN in the near infrared\nthat will allow us to pierce the dust in these objects and study the nuclear regions. One of the goals of this survey is to study the obscuring dust tori (if\npresent) in these objects. Here we present preliminary results for one of the\nobjects in our sample, the prototype radio galaxy Cyg A. For details on the observations, see Canalizo et al. (2003, hereafter Paper I; 2004, in preparation).\n\n\f2\n\n2.\n\nThe Torus in Cygnus A\n\nBecause of its proximity (z = 0.056) and extreme characteristics, Cyg A\nhas played a fundamental role in the study of virtually every aspect of powerful radio galaxies. Different lines of evidence indicate that Cyg A harbors\na heavily extincted quasar (e.g., Ogle et al. 1997). According to unification\nschemes, this quasar would be hidden by an optically and geometrically thick\ndust torus. Figure 1 shows a Keck NIRC2 AO K \u2032 image of the central region\nof Cyg A with a resolution of \u223c 0.05\" (or 50 pc for H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ).\nThe two edge-brightened cones clearly seen in this image are strongly suggestive of a dust torus casting a shadow onto the surrounding gas. There are two\nunresolved sources in the central region: the \"primary\", near (but slightly offcenter from) the vertex of the cones, and the \"secondary\", which appears to be\nthe tidally stripped core of a lower mass merging galaxy (Paper I).\nHST NICMOS observations of the primary point source show that it is\nhighly polarized (Pk \u223c 25%) with a polarization angle roughly perpendicular to the jets (Tadhunter et al. 2000; 1999). Overlaying these data with HST\nFOC polarization data indicates that the primary is within 0.1\" of the scattering\ncenter (M. Kishimoto, personal communication). While it is tempting to associate this point source with the quasar nucleus, its flux is considerably higher\nthan that predicted by X-ray observations. Ward et al. (1991) predict a continuum flux density at 2.2 \u03bcm of 3.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 A\u22121 . Assuming a\nnormal dust-to-gas ratio, Ueno et al. (1994) estimate AV = 170 from the Xray absorption column. Combining both results, we expect a quasar continuum\nemission of 9.6 \u00d7 10\u221221 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 A\u22121 at 2.2 \u03bcm. However, we measure\na 2.2 \u03bcm flux of 1.53 \u00d7 10\u221218 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 A\u22121 . From our NIRC2 K-band\nspectrum (see below; Fig. 2) we estimate that 36% of the total flux comes from\nemission lines, so the observed continuum flux density is 9.8\u00d710\u221219 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 A\u22121 , two orders of magnitude greater than expected. It is certainly possible that the extinction may be overestimated if the mean dust grain size is larger\nthan assumed (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2001). However, the K-band spectrum of\nthis point source (Fig. 2) does not show obvious broad lines, indicating that the\nbroad line region is indeed at least partially hidden at these wavelengths.\nA more likely interpretation for the K \u2032 point source is that it is the hot inner\nrim of the dust torus seen through the upper opening of the torus. The quasar\nitself is hidden behind the SE half of the torus, which is closer to us than its\nNW counterpart (recall that the NW jet points toward us and the SE jet away\nfrom us; see e.g., Carilli & Barthel 1996). Using observations of the 9.7 \u03bcm\nsilicate dust absorption feature toward the nucleus, Imanishi & Ueno (2000)\nestimate an inner radius for the torus of less than 10 pc. Since the resolution\nof our images is 50 pc, a torus opening of this order would certainly appear\nunresolved.\n\n\fDust Tori in AGN\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. False-color NIRC2 AO K \u2032 image of the core of Cyg A. North is up and East is to\nthe left. White arrows indicate the direction of the jets and parallel lines the slit positions.\n\nWe obtained K-band Keck AO spectroscopy at the two slit positions indicated in Fig. 1. Slit A corresponds to the NIRC2 spectrum shown in Fig. 2,\nwith total integration of 3600 s. The slit was placed roughly perpendicular to\nthe jets, presumably along the torus. The plate scale in the cross-dispersion\ndirection is 0.04\" pixel\u22121 (or \u223c 40 pc for Cyg A). Slit B corresponds to a NIRSPEC spectrum with a total integration time of 2400 s. This slit was placed as\nclose to the axis of the jets as possible, given the constraints imposed by the\nAO system (Paper I). The data were binned in the cross dispersion direction to\nmatch the spatial resolution of the NIRC2 data.\nFigure 3 shows, for each slit position, a plot of the flux ratio of the H2\n\u03bd = 1 \u2212 0 S(1) line to Pa\u03b1, as a function of the distance from the primary\npoint source. For Slit A (left panel), the ratio is clearly lower in the region\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 2. Keck NIRC2 AO spectrum of the 640 central parsecs of Cyg A. The slit was placed\nroughly perpendicular to the direction of the jets (Slit A in Fig. 1)\n\ncentered around the point source. The change in the ratio is unlikely to be\ndue to extinction, since the ratio of Br\u03b3 to Pa\u03b1 remains constant over this region. A plausible explanation for this trend is that the molecular hydrogen is\nshielded from the continuum source on either side of the torus, leading to a\nhigher H2 /Pa\u03b1 ratio. Since the torus is inclined some 30 to 60 degrees with respect to the line of sight, the emission we observe in this region actually comes\nfrom the region above the torus. Here the molecular hydrogen is no longer\nshielded and is thus photodissociated, so that the only emission we observe\ncomes from the foreground; hence its ratio to Pa\u03b1 drops. From this plot, it\nmay be inferred that the diameter of the torus is between 500 and 600 pc.\nIn the case of Slit B (Fig. 3, right panel), we are measuring H2 /Pa\u03b1 in the\ndirection of the ionization cones, so that H2 is mostly photodissociated within\nthe cones. However, in the region SE of the opening of the torus (at distance\n< 0), the ratio increases since this region is shielded by the SE half of the\ntorus. The ratio decreases again at roughly \u2212300 pc, presumably beyond the\nshadow of the torus. The projected size of the torus would then be roughly\n300 \u00d7 2 = 600 pc. To obtain an actual diameter of the torus from this value we\nmust take into consideration the scale height as well as the inclination angle,\nand the angle between the slit and the axis of the jets.\nThus, we infer a projected diameter of \u223c600 pc for the torus in Cyg A. This\nvalue is consistent with values inferred using other methods, e.g., < 800 pc\nfrom \u223c 0.8\" resolution optical images (Vestergaard & Barthel 1993) and \"a\nfew hundred parsecs\" from infrared observations of the 9.7 \u03bcm silicate dust\n\n\fDust Tori in AGN\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.
