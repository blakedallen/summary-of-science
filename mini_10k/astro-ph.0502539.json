We present new redshifts for 738 galaxies in 21 ESO Imaging Survey (EIS)\nCluster fields. We use the \"gap\"-technique to search for significant overdensities in redshift space and to identify\ngroups/clusters of galaxies corresponding to the original EIS matched filter cluster candidates. In this way we\nspectroscopically confirm 20 of the 21 cluster candidates with a matched-filter estimated redshift zM F = 0.2. We\nhave now obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34 EIS cluster candidates with zM F = 0.2 (see also Hansen et al.\n2002; Olsen et al. 2003). Of those we spectroscopically confirm 32 with redshifts ranging from z = 0.064 to 0.283.\nWe find that: 1) the velocity dispersions of the systems range from \u03c3v \u2264 130km/s to \u03c3v = 1200km/s, typical of\ngalaxy groups to rich clusters; 2) richnesses corresponding to Abell classes R \u2264 1; and 3) concentration indices\nranging from C = 0.2 to C = 1.2. From the analysis of the colours of the galaxy populations we find that 53%\nof the spectroscopically confirmed systems have a \"significant\" red sequence. These systems are on average richer\nand have higher velocity dispersions. We find that the colour of the red sequence galaxies matches passive stellar\nevolution predictions.\nKey words. galaxies: clusters: general \u2013 cosmology: observations \u2013 galaxies: distances and redshifts \u2013 galaxies:\nphotometry\n\n1. Introduction\nThe evolution of galaxy clusters' properties, as well as\nthat of their constituent galaxies, are important issues for\ncontemporary cosmology and astrophysics. The requirement for large samples of clusters of galaxies covering a\nlarge range in redshift has prompted systematic efforts\nto assemble catalogues of distant galaxy clusters (e.g.\nGunn et al. 1986; Postman et al. 1996; Scodeggio et al.\n1999; Gladders & Yee 2001; Gonzalez et al. 2001;\nBahcall et al. 2003). The main goal behind such works\nis to assemble large samples of clusters with z & 0.5\nbecause at these redshifts the evolutionary effects become\nmore significant. However, another important issue in\nSend offprint requests to: L.F.

This sample can be taken from\nother surveys, but it would be preferable to build it from\nthe same survey, in order to minimize the differences in\nselection effects.\n\nDuring the past decade a number of galaxy cluster catalogues based on optical imaging data and constructed using objective methods have become available (e.g. Postman et al. 1996; Gladders & Yee 2001;\nPostman et al. 2002; Bahcall et al. 2003; Goto et al.\n2002). Each method uses its own combination of single\npassband luminosities, colour indices and galaxy position,\nand it is thus of great interest to compare whether the\nvarious methods detect the same systems. The comparison can be carried out along two tracks. One is to directly\ncompare detections by different methods over the same\narea, and the other is to compare the general properties\nof the samples created by different detection algorithms\n(e.g. Goto et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2002; Bahcall et al.\n2003; Lopes et al. 2004; Rizzo et al. 2004). Whatever the\nmethod utilized, spectroscopic follow-up is essential to\n\n\f2\n\nL.F. Olsen et al.: Multi-object spectroscopy of low redshift EIS clusters. III.\n\nconfirm that the candidates are physical systems as well\nas to characterize their properties.\nThis work is part of a major on-going confirmation\neffort to study all EIS cluster candidates (Olsen et al.\n1999a,b; Scodeggio et al. 1999). This sample consists of\n302 cluster candidates with matched filter estimated redshifts 0.2 \u2264 zMF \u2264 1.3 and a median estimated redshift\nof zMF = 0.5. The cluster candidates were identified using the matched filter technique originally suggested by\nPostman et al. (1996). The spectroscopic confirmation of\nthe clusters was initiated by Ramella et al. (2000), who\nused the multi-object spectroscopy mode at the ESO 3.6m\ntelescope at La Silla, Chile, to obtain confirmations of intermediate redshift candidates (0.5 . zMF . 0.7). They\ntargeted six cluster candidates of which four were confirmed. Benoist et al. (2002) presented the first results for\nthe high redshift sample (z & 0.8) with confirmation of\nthree EIS clusters.\nIn this work we report on a systematic spectroscopic\nfollow-up of the low-redshift EIS cluster candidates having zMF = 0.2. The sample was drawn from candidates\nlocated in EIS patches A, B and D (Nonino et al. 1999)\nand consists of 68% (34 systems) of all EIS cluster candidates at this redshift. The present work follows that of\nHansen et al. (2002, hereafter Paper I) and Olsen et al.\n(2003, hereafter Paper II). In Paper I we presented the results of a feasability study confirming five clusters in patch\nD of which three have zMF = 0.2 and two have zMF = 0.3.\nIn Paper II we presented the follow-up of candidates in\npatches A and B where 9 out of 10 additional cluster candidates were confirmed. In this third paper we present the\nspectroscopic results for the 21 remaining systems in EIS\npatch D.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 gives an\noverview of the observations and data reduction. Sect. 3\ndescribes the identification of systems in redshift space\nas well as the procedure adopted for associating the redshift groups to the EIS detections. Sect. 4 describes the\nproperties of the spectroscopically confirmed systems including an analysis of the colour properties of the galaxy\npopulations. In Sect. 5 we discuss our results and relate\nthe dynamical properties to the colour properties. Finally,\nSect. 6 summarizes the paper.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nThe targeted cluster candidates were selected from\npatch D with a matched filter estimated redshift zMF =\n0.2 (Scodeggio et al. 1999). In Table 1 we list the 24 selected cluster candidates. Three of these systems were already studied in Paper I as noted in the table, leaving 21\nsystems for the present work. The table gives: in Col. 1\nthe name of the field referring to the notation adopted by\nScodeggio et al. (1999); in Cols. 2 and 3 the matched filter\nposition; and in Col. 4 the \u039bcl,org -richness. This richness\nrange roughly corresponds to the Abell richness classes\n\u2264 1 (e.g. Postman et al. 1996).\n\nFig. 1. The distribution of completeness, the fraction of\ntargeted galaxies to all galaxies (upper panel), and efficiency, the fraction of spectra that yielded a redshift determination (lower panel) per field.\n\nThe observations were carried out using the Danish\nFaint Object Spectrograph and Camera (DFOSC)\nmounted on the Danish 1.54m telescope at ESO, La Silla,\nChile. With a field of view of 13.7 \u00d7 13.7 square arcmins corresponding to 2.53Mpc at z = 0.2 (assuming\nH0 = 75km/s/Mpc, \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7), this instrument is well-suited for MOS observations of moderate redshift clusters. The effective field that could be covered with\nMOS slit masks was typically 11.0 \u00d7 5.5 square arcmins,\ndepending on the exact configuration of galaxy positions\nin each field. The slit width was set to 2\u2032\u2032 , and the slit\nlength varied according to the extent of each galaxy. We\nused grism #4, giving a dispersion of 220 \u00c5/mm, and covering a wavelength range from 3800 to 7500 \u00c5.

The EIS\nidentification is the same except for this \"J\".\nb\nReported in Paper I\n\nWe targeted preferentially the bright galaxies with\nI-magnitude, I \u2264 19.51 . The Schechter magnitude at\nz = 0.2 is estimated to be I \u2217 \u223c 17.5 using an absolute Schechter magnitude of MI\u2217 = \u221221.90 as commonly\nadopted (e.g. Postman et al. 1996; Olsen et al. 1999a).\nThe corresponding apparent magnitude was computed using the K-correction for an elliptical galaxy template spectrum from the Kinney library (Kinney et al. 1996). We\nthus estimate our survey to cover galaxies to 2 magnitudes\nfainter than the Schechter magnitude. This procedure was\nchosen to avoid possible biases introduced by an additional\ncolour selection of the target galaxies. The allocated observing time allowed us to expose two slit masks for each\ncluster field. The exposure time for each mask was in all\ncases one hour. We estimate the S/N of the spectra to be\nin the range 5 to 15.\nThe data reduction was performed using the IRAF2\npackage. The CCD bias level was determined from overscan regions and subtracted. The flatfielding was carried\nout using the two sets of flatfields obtained immediately\nbefore and after each observation. After the basic reduc1\nAll magnitudes are quoted in the EIS magnitude system as provided by the EIS team, see Nonino et al. (1999);\nPrandoni et al. (1999); Benoist et al. (1999)\n2\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy\nObservatories, which is operated by AURA Inc. under contract\nwith NSF.\n\ntions we used standard procedures to extract the spectra and to obtain redshifts by Fourier cross-correlating\nour spectra with standard galaxy spectra templates from\nKinney et al. (1996). For the cross-correlation the template spectra were always redshifted close to the redshift\nunder consideration. All the cross-correlation function results were visually inspected and the reliability of the peak\nwas evaluated. Whenever a peak in the correlation function was accepted as real or possibly real, the observed\nspectrum was inspected and compared to the expected\npositions of the most prominent spectral features. We required that some features like the Ca H and K lines, the\n4000 \u00c5 break, or emission lines should be identified before\na determination was accepted as certain. In Paper I the\nreduction procedures are described in more detail.\nWith two slit masks per field regardless of the galaxy\ndensity we do not reach the same level of completeness in\nall fields, due to the variations in the local galaxy density. Therefore, we have investigated how the completeness varies from field to field. In Table 2 we summarize\nthe spectroscopic results. The Table lists: in Col. 1 the\nfield name; in Col. 2 the number of target galaxies; in\nCol. 3 the number of derived redshifts; in Col. 4 the completeness as defined below; and in Col. 5 the efficiency of\nobtaining redshifts (the ratio between Col. 3 and Col. 2).\nThe completeness given in Col. 4 is defined as the ratio\nof observed to all galaxies brighter than I = 19.5 within\n\n\f4\n\nL.F.

The completeness (upper panel) and efficiency\n(lower panel) as function of magnitude as found for the\ncluster EISJ0953-2017. The completeness and efficiency\nfor this cluster as computed in Table 2 correspond to the\ntypical values as can be seen in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 2 shows the completeness and efficiency as function of magnitude for the field of EISJ0953-2017, for which\ncompleteness and efficiency correpond to the typical values as found from Fig. 1. It can be seen that the completeness is very high at the brightest magnitudes but decreases\nto \u223c 25% at about I = 19.5. Regarding extraction of the\nredshifts it can be seen that the efficiency is quite high,\nreaching \u223c 50% at I \u223c 19.5.\nIn order to estimate the uncertainty of the measured\nredshifts we have observed several galaxies in two different masks. In total we have observed 106 galaxies twice.\nWe use the corresponding redshift pairs to estimate the\nuncertainty of the individual redshift measurements. We\nseparate the pairs in three groups: those for which we\ndid not succeed in measuring the redshift at all, those for\nwhich the redshift could be determined in only one case\nand those with two redshift measurements. The first two\ngroups cannot be used for estimating the uncertainty, but\nit is interesting to see that the galaxies in the first group\nare all fainter than I \u223c 18.8 and in the second group they\nare fainter than I \u223c 17.7. The last group consists of 49\npairs of redshifts for which the magnitudes lie in the interval I \u223c 16.1 \u2212 20.0, thus covering the entire magnitude\nrange investigated here. For these 49 pairs we find that\nthe standard deviation of the redshift difference between\nthe two independent measurements is \u2206z = 0.0006 corresponding to an uncertainty of the individual measurements of \u03c3z = 0.0004. This is in good agreement with the\nuncertainty of the individual redshift measurements that\nwas estimated in Paper I from the width of the peaks of\nthe correlation function to be \u03b4z = 0.0005.\n\n3. Identification of groups in redshift space\n\na rectangular region. The latter is defined as the smallest\nrectangle covering all observed galaxies and is outlined by\ndashed lines in Fig. 4.\n\nIn Fig. 1 we show the distributions of the completeness\nand efficiency. One finds that in general the completeness\nis \u223c 60% except for three fields. This could have two reasons: (1) the galaxies are distributed such that fewer slits\ncould fit in or (2) the field is much richer than the average\nfield. Inspecting Fig. 4 it seems that the low completeness\nis probably caused by a combination of the two. The efficiency is found to cover the range between 0.53 and 0.88\nwith most fields having an efficiency of \u223c 80%.\n\nWe have obtained 738 redshifts for galaxies in 21 EIS cluster candidate fields. Table 3, available at the CDS3 , lists:\nin Col. 1 a running identifier for each galaxy; in Cols. 2\nand 3 the right ascension and declination in J2000 for the\ngalaxy; Col. 4 the I-magnitude from the EIS object catalogues (Benoist et al. 1999); and in Col. 5 the measured\nredshift. A colon (\":\") marks a measurement for which we\ncould not identify any features to confirm the redshift, and\nan \"e\" indicates that the spectrum had emission lines.\nThe number of derived redshifts ranges between 26 and\n44 per field. In Fig. 3 we show the redshifts for each field.\nThe upper parts show the bar diagram of the redshifts\nwhile the lower part gives the redshift histogram with a\nbin size of \u2206z = 0.01.

Fig. 3 shows the identified groups as the\nsolid histograms. We have selected a gap-size of \u2206z =\n0.005(1 + z) corresponding to 1500km/s in the restframe.\nFor assessing the significance of the identified groups we\nuse the CNOC2 0223+00 catalogue (Yee et al. 2000). The\nsignificance is determined from the probability of finding\na group with the same number of objects or more at the\nsame redshift (see Olsen et al. 2003, for more details).\nThis significance is referred to as \u03c31 .\nIn Table 4 we list all groups with significance larger\nthan 99% identified in each cluster field. The Table lists:\nin Col 1 the cluster field name; in Col. 2 the number of\nspectroscopic members of the group; in Cols. 3 and 4 the\nmean position in J2000; in Col. 5 the mean redshift of\nthe group members; in Col. 6 the velocity dispersion corrected for our measurement accuracy. In cases where the\nmeasured velocity dispersion is smaller than the measurement error we list the value of \u03c3v = 0; and in Cols. 7 the\nsignificance as defined above.\nThe table lists 62 significant groups, ranging between\ntwo and five groups per cluster field, having from 3 to\n25 members. In many cases a single group dominates the\nfield, with many more members than the others. In these\ncases, there is little ambiguity in associating this group to\nthe matched filter detection. This is the case for 12 of 21\n(\u223c 57%) fields. In the remaining cases the redshift distribution is more complex and consequently, the association\nof a group to the matched filter detection is more difficult.\nIn other words, this is the result of the projection effects\nthat plague the identification of clusters from a projected\ndistribution of galaxies using a single passband.\n\nCompl.\n0.50\n0.65\n0.19\n0.61\n0.76\n0.66\n0.17\n0.62\n0.14\n0.61\n0.52\n0.55\n0.62\n0.60\n0.67\n0.53\n0.69\n0.66\n0.62\n0.64\n0.68\n\nEfficiency\n0.68\n0.60\n0.75\n0.61\n0.78\n0.83\n0.59\n0.74\n0.84\n0.88\n0.81\n0.67\n0.80\n0.81\n0.76\n0.80\n0.53\n0.85\n0.76\n0.74\n0.81\n\nThe group associated with the matched filter detection\nis chosen as follows: 1) The richest group in the field, if\nit has a significantly larger number of members than the\nother groups; 2) The one closest to the EIS position, if\ntwo groups have roughly the same number of members;\n3) The most concentrated group, if two groups are close\nto the EIS position and have almost the same number of\nmembers. Note that in all but one case (EISJ0950-2133)\nwe associated the richest significant group with the EIS\ndetection.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the projected distribution of all\ngalaxies with I \u2264 19.5 in the cluster regions. The solid circles mark galaxies belonging to the group associated with\nthe EIS cluster candidate, and the crosses mark galaxies\nwith redshifts outside the group. The large circles mark\nthe area within 0.5h\u22121\n75 Mpc from the cluster center. From\nthis analysis we find that 20 out of 21 (\u223c 95%) cluster candidates are confirmed as overdensities in redshift space. In\none case (EISJ0949-2145), we do not consider any of the\ngroups as representing the matched filter detection, since\nthe number of members of the groups is small and they\nare spread over most of the surveyed area.\n\n3.1. Projection effects\nOne of the main problems in detecting clusters from the\nprojected galaxy distribution is the contamination along\nthe line of sight. This effect may have two origins: one\nis the superposition of galaxy systems and the other the\ncontamination by field galaxies.\nAs noted above, all the surveyed fields studied in the\npresent paper contain more than one significant group in\n\n\f6\n\nL.F.

We find that one\ncase (EISJ2241-3949) is likely to be affected by superposition even though it has 18 member galaxies and thus the\nfield contamination is relatively low. Furthermore, we find\nfour cases with less than ten members (EISJ0046-2925,\nEISJ2243-4013, EISJ2244-3955, EISJ2246-4012A) where\nonly one group is identified and these systems are thus\nlikely to be significantly contaminated by field galaxies.\nIn summary, we estimate that 13 out of 32 systems\n(\u223c 40%) are likely to be contaminated and care should be\ntaken when interpreting results based on these systems.\n\n3.2. Summary\nCombining the results of the present paper with those\nof Papers I and II we find an overall confirmation rate\nof \u223c 94% (32 clusters of 34 candidates) covering a region of about \u223c 9 square degrees. This confirmation rate\nis consistent with the expected rate of false detecions of\n\u223c 1 at zMF = 0.2 within the area considered here estimated by Olsen (2000). The results are also in good agreement with those of Holden et al. (1999), Holden et al.\n(2000) and Postman et al. (2002), who carried out spectroscopic follow-up of cluster candidates detected using a\nsimilar matched filter technique. Holden et al. (1999) and\nHolden et al. (2000) studied 9 candidates with zMF \u2264 0.3\nof which they confirmed 8 and Postman et al. (2002) confirmed 13 out of 15 clusters with zMF = 0.3.\n\n4. Properties of the detected systems\nIn the previous section we established the existence of systems in redshift space that we consider confirmations of\nthe EIS clusters.

To characterize the systems in more detail we also\ndescribe their richness and concentration parameters as\nwell as determine the colours of their galaxy populations.\nIn Table 5 we summarize the properties of the confirmed\nsystems. The table gives: in Col. 1 a running number identifying the system; in Col. 2 the name of the cluster field;\nin Col. 3 the number of spectroscopic members; in Col. 4\nthe spectroscopic redshift; in Col. 5 the velocity dispersion with 68% bootstrap errors; in Col. 6 updated \u039bcl,new richnesses as described below; in Col. 7 the concentration\nindex as computed in Sect. 4.4; in Col. 8 and 9 the colour\nof the identified photometric red sequence and the confidence level as described in Sect. 4.5; in Col. 10 and 11\nthe colour of the red sequence of the spectroscopic members and its significance as also described in Sect. 4.5; in\nCol. 12 the measured colour scatter for the spectroscopic\nmembers. For three systems we do not have colour information available, so we mark the relevant entries by N.A.\nin the table.\n\n4.1. Redshifts\nTo investigate the reliability of the measured spectroscopic\nredshifts for the confirmed clusters, we have compared the\nresults from three different redshift estimators: the traditional mean redshift, the median and the biweight location\n(Beers et al. 1990) of the redshift of the identified systems.\nWe find that the three estimators give consistent results\nwith small deviations of the order \u03b4z \u223c 0.002. Hence, we\ncontinue to report mean values in order to be compatible\nwith our previously published redshifts.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the distribution of redshifts for all\nconfirmed systems. We find that the average redshift of the\nspectroscopically confirmed systems is hzi = 0.186 with\na standard deviation of \u03c3zspec = 0.058. This is in good\n\n\f8\n\nL.F.

Therefore, it is important to determine the velocity dispersion using an estimator that is robust both for\nsmall samples and with respect to outliers. Beers et al.\n(1990) investigated the problem in detail and suggested\nthe use of the biweight scale or gapper estimators.\nWe have compared the estimates of the velocity dispersion for our systems using these two estimators as well as\nthe traditional standard deviation. In general, the velocity\ndispersions estimated by the different methods are consistent with the differences of the order . 50km/s, much\nsmaller than the bootstrap-estimated errors. However, in\n\ntwo cases the biweight estimator gives significantly smaller\nvalues than the other two (though with large errors and\nstill the values agree within the errors). These two cases\nare EISJ0952-2103 (panel 14 of Fig. 6) and EISJ0955-2151\n(panel 21) with the traditional standard deviation giving\nestimates that are significantly higher.\nInspecting the redshift distribution of EISJ0952-2103\nwe find that the 18 members split into three groups containing one, five and twelve members, respectively. We\nfind that the biweight estimator reflects the velocity dispersion of the largest, and most concentrated group, while\nthe other methods are more sensitive to the outlying mem-\n\n\f12\n\nL.F. Olsen et al.: Multi-object spectroscopy of low redshift EIS clusters. III.\n\nFig. 5. The distribution of spectroscopic redshifts of all\nthe confirmed systems.\n\nbers. The large error given in Table 5 probably reflects the\npresence of the outliers.\nThe other case is EISJ0955-2151 (panel 21) with only\n9 members, one being an outlier, which explains the large\ndiscrepancy reported above and the large error in Table 5.\nIt is worth emphasizing, that this system is one of those\nwe, in Sect. 3, found to be affected by projection effects.\nInspecting Fig. 6 we also find outliers in panels 15,\n20 and 25. However, in these cases the different velocity\ndispersion estimates are not as discrepant as in the aforementioned cases, but large errors, comparable to those\ndiscussed above, reflect the presence of outliers.\nHereafter, we adopt the biweight method to compute\nthe velocity dispersions listed in Col. 5 of Table 5 with\n68% bootstrap errors. The distribution of these velocity\ndispersions (solid line) is shown in Fig. 7. This distribution is compared to those of Fadda et al. (1996) and\nZabludoff et al. (1990), which will be discussed in Sect. 5.\nAs seen from this figure and Table 5 we find systems with\nvery low velocity dispersions. In particular, the clusters\nEISJ0950-2133 (panel 9) and EISJ0953-2156 (panel 18)\nhave implausibly low velocity dispersions, possibly indicating severe undersampling.\n\n4.3. Richness\nThe matched filter algorithm also provides a measure of\nthe richness (\u039bcl ) for the cluster candidates based on the\nestimated redshifts, where the \u039bcl -richness is equivalent\nto the number of L\u2217 -galaxies contributing to the matched\nfilter signal of a particular detection. This computation depends on the apparent Schechter magnitude and angular\nextent of the cluster, which at these redshifts vary rapidly.\nTherefore, even though the spectroscopic and estimated\nredshifts are in good agreement we have to recompute the\ncluster richness using the assigned spectroscopic redshift.\nThe new richness values (\u039bcl,new ) are listed in Table 5 and\ncompared with the original estimates (\u039bcl,org ) in Fig. 8.\n\nFig. 7. Distribution of velocity dispersions (solid line)\ncompared with those of Fadda et al. (1996) \u2013 dotted histogram \u2013 and those of Zabludoff et al.

The\nsolid line marks \u039bcl,org = \u039bcl,new .\n\nIn general the new richnesses are smaller than the original\nones. This is in good agreement with the, on average, lower\nredshift relative to the zMF estimate since the expected\napparent Schechter magnitude is now brighter and thus\nthe observed cluster luminosity corresponds to fewer L\u2217 galaxies. The lower redshift also causes a larger region to\nbe used for the richness measurement, but the added luminosity from those large cluster-centric distances is small.\nFinally, in Fig. 9 we show the distribution of \u039bcl,new richnesses that covers the range 10 . \u039bcl,new . 50. This\nrange corresponds to Abell richness class \u2264 1, typical of\npoor galaxy clusters. This is not surprising considering\nthe relatively small volume surveyed for clusters at the\nlow redshift range considered here.\n\n\fL.F.

Concentration\nUsing the definition by Butcher & Oemler (1984) we have\ncomputed concentration indices for all the clusters. The\nconcentration index is defined as C = log (R60 /R20 ),\nwhere Rn is the radius encircling n% of the galaxies.\nButcher & Oemler found that, in the local Universe, clusters with C & 0.4 were centrally concentrated and dominated by ellipticals, while those with C \u223c 0.3 are closer\nto uniform-density spheres and would be dominated by\nspirals.\nWe compute the concentration index based on the\n\u22121\nbackground corrected galaxy counts within 2h75\nMpc from\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe cluster center with I \u2264 I (z)+2, where I (z) is the expected I-band Schechter magnitude at the redshift of the\ncluster (see Sect. 2). The background correction is based\non galaxies with magnitudes in the same range and clus\u22121\ntercentric distance between 2h\u22121\n75 Mpc and 3h75 Mpc. The\ncomputed concentration indices are given in Table 5 and\ntheir distribution (solid line) is shown in Fig. 10. For com-\n\nAnother important characteristic of a galaxy cluster is\nthe colour properties of its population. In particular,\nthe colour-magnitude diagram of cluster members normally reveals the presence of a narrow sequence of bright,\nearly-type galaxies known as the \"red sequence\" (e.g.\nGladders et al. 1998; Stanford et al. 1998; Holden et al.\n2004; L\u00f3pez-Cruz et al. 2004). The presence of this colourmagnitude (CM) relation serves as unambiguous evidence\nfor the presence of a real physical system. Furthermore,\nits characteristics, such as colour, slope and scatter, have\nbeen extensively used to constrain galaxy evolution models (e.g. Gladders et al. 1998). While most of the previous\nstudies focused on relatively rich systems, the presence of\nred sequences in very poor clusters and groups has also\nbeen reported (e.g. Andreon 2003).\nThe properties of the colour-magnitude relation are\nfound to be very homogeneous, even though they\nevolve with redshift (e.g. Arag\u00f3n-Salamanca et al. 1993;\nStanford et al. 1998). Below we use this fact and the measured slope for clusters at redshifts close to the ones being\nconsidered here as the basis for an objective method for\ndetecting CM relations.\nFor 29 of the 32 systems analysed here, V -band images were also available, thus allowing us to construct\nand investigate the CM diagram of the \"cluster\" members. The (V \u2212 I) \u00d7 I CM diagrams were constructed considering galaxies within a radius of 0.75h\u22121\n75 Mpc and are\nshown in Fig. 11. For each system: 1) the left panel gives\nthe aforementioned colour-magnitude diagram for galaxies (dots) brighter than I = 21; filled circles indicate spectroscopically confirmed members and crosses other galaxies with measured redshifts. Also shown in this panel are\nthe best-estimated loci characterizing the so-called red sequence (see below) as determined from the photometric\ndata alone (dashed line) and that obtained considering\nonly the confirmed spectroscopic members (solid line); 2)\nthe middle panel shows the background-corrected colour\ndistribution of galaxies brighter than I = 19.5 within\nthe same radius. The background correction is estimated\nfrom the colour distribution of galaxies lying between radii\n\u22121\n2h\u22121\n75 Mpc and 3h75 Mpc; and 3) the right panel shows the\ncolour distribution of spectroscopic members (solid histogram) and that of all galaxies with measured redshifts\n(dotted histogram).\nFrom these diagrams it is clear that some of the clusters do have a well-defined red sequence, while for others\nthe red sequence is either poorly defined or completely\nabsent. Here we use the properties of the CM relation\n\n\fL.F. Olsen et al.: Multi-object spectroscopy of low redshift EIS clusters. III.\n\n15\n\nFig. 11. For each cluster we show 3 diagrams with the cluster identification number indicated in the first one. The\nfirst diagram is the colour-magnitude diagram for all galaxies within 0.75h\u22121\n75 Mpc from the cluster center (dots). On\ntop of that we mark by solid circles the spectroscopic members of the confirmed group and by crosses the remaining\ngalaxies with redshifts. The solid line is the locus of the red sequence detected from the spectroscopic members and\nthe dashed line is the one detected in the photometric analysis. In both cases we only show the line if we consider the\nsequence significant (see the text for details). The second plot is the \"tilted colour histogram\" for the galaxies with\nI \u2264 19.5 in the same region statistically corrected for the background contribution. The last panel is the \"tilted colour\nhistogram\" for the spectroscopic members (solid line) and for all galaxies with a redshift (dotted line).\n\n\f16\n\nFig. 11. \u2013 Continued\n\nL.F.

III.\n\nmentioned above to develop an objective method for determining its presence and properties.\nAs mentioned above, the red sequence consists of earlytype cluster galaxies. Therefore, to identify the presence\nof a red sequence and thus distinguish between localized\ndensity enhancements and physically bound systems, one\nwould require both morphological information and complete spectroscopic data. In the present work we do not\nhave morphological data nor complete spectroscopic data\nand therefore we carry out a statistical analysis to identify red sequences in the colour distribution of galaxies\nin the cluster fields using the following method. First, we\nbuild a \"tilted colour histogram\", counting galaxies within\nslices of a given width and characterized by a slope taken\nto be comparable to that typically observed for the CM\nrelations of nearby clusters. We then construct two such\nhistograms with a relative shift of half a bin width. This\nis done in order to avoid splitting a sequence between two\nbins, thereby artificially decreasing its significance. To obtain the colour histogram only for the cluster galaxies, the\nhistograms are background corrected, as described below.\nWe determine the colour of the red sequence by separately\nanalyzing both histograms. First, we identify the highest\npeak considering only those that are narrower than a certain value, taking into account the fact that the scatter\naround the CM relation in nearby clusters is very small\n(\u2264 0.1mag, e.g. L\u00f3pez-Cruz et al. 2004). Next, based on\nsimulations, we compute the confidence level of the peaks\nand assign the colour of the most significant peak to be\nthat of the red sequence.\nWe apply this method to two datasets. First, we consider all available photometric data, which has the advantage of good statistics but is susceptible to projection\neffects possibly leading to contamination by non-cluster\nmembers, thereby diluting a possible red sequence. Then,\nwe consider the spectroscopic data. While these are not affected by projection effects, the statistics are usually poor\ndue to both the low richness of the systems being analysed\nand the incompleteness of the spectroscopic data. There\nmay also be false detection of a red sequence due to incompleteness/selection effects.\nIn the analysis described below and illustrated in the\nmiddle and right panels of Fig. 11 we use the following\nparameters. The bin width is chosen to be \u2206(V \u2212 I) =\n0.15mag. Because of the tilted nature of the histograms\nwe arbitrarily define the center of the bins at I = 17 and\nin the range from (V \u2212 I) = \u22120.075 and (V \u2212 I) = 2.85.\nWe adopt a slope of \u22120.05 as found by L\u00f3pez-Cruz et al.\n(2004) for the (B \u2212 R) \u00d7 R CM relation at z \u223c 0.05.\nThe (B \u2212 R) at that redshift roughly corresponds to\n(V \u2212 I) at z \u223c 0.2. We restrict the red sequence colours\nto be in the range 1.0 \u2264 (V \u2212 I) \u2264 2.0. This colour\nrange was chosen to avoid the tails of the colour distributions, where poor statistics may artificially increase the\npeak significances. Furthermore, it is well-matched with\nthe colours expected for elliptical galaxies at these redshifts (e.g. Bruzual & Charlot 1993). We only consider\npeaks narrower than 0.3mag. This choice is rather con-\n\nservative since the estimated uncertainties of the (V \u2212 I)\ncolour at the faintest end considered is \u03c3(V \u2212I) \u223c 0.04\n(Prandoni et al. 1999).\n\n4.5.2. Photometric data\nIn this case the \"tilted colour histogram\" is constructed\nfor galaxies brighter then I = 19.5 within the area inside a\nradius of 0.75h\u22121\n75 Mpc, hereafter referred to as the cluster\narea. The background contribution is estimated from the\n\"tilted colour histogram\" of galaxies in the same magnitude range but at a distance ranging from 2h\u22121\n75 Mpc to\n3h\u22121\nMpc\nand\nthen\nscaled\nto\nthe\ncluster\narea.\nFor\nbins for\n75\nwhich the expected field contribution is larger than the\nnumber of galaxies in the cluster area, we set the number\nof cluster galaxies to zero. In order to compute the significance of the identified\npeaks we use the signal-to-noise\np\nratio (S/N = Ncl / Ntot + Nbkg ). Here Ncl is the number of cluster galaxies in the bin, Ntot is the number of\ngalaxies in the bin in the original histogram before field\ncorrection and Nbkg is the expected number of background\ngalaxies in that bin for the cluster area.\nIn order to quantify the significance (\u03c3S/N ) of a given\nS/N we have carried out a series of simulations. For each\nmeasured cluster redshift we have selected 1000 random\npositions within our (V \u2212 I) galaxy catalogue and constructed similar \"tilted colour histograms\" for those positions. From these histograms we construct the distribution of the measured S/N and determine the probability\nof finding a peak with a similar S/N as the one found\nfor the cluster. Since we limit ourselves to a quite narrow\ncolour range (1.0 \u2264 (V \u2212I) \u2264 2.0), the field contribution is\nroughly constant and thus we do not separate the significances by colour. In Fig. 12 we show the distribution of the\nmeasured S/N for three different redshifts. It is clear that\none cannot rely on simply taking the same S/N threshold\nfor all redshifts. This is mainly due to the larger sky area\nfor the nearer clusters. In order to determine the significance for a given system we use the simulations carried out\nusing the same redshift and determine how frequently a\npeak with similar or larger S/N occur in the field samples.\nThe significance is computed as this frequency subtracted\nfrom unity. We define the threshold for considering a red\nsequence real to be \u03c3S/N \u2265 90%. In the middle panels\nof Fig 11 we show that of the two histograms with the\nhighest peaks.\n\n4.5.3. Spectroscopic data\nThe \"tilted colour histograms\" of the spectroscopic members do not need any background subtraction. The significance of the peak is assessed by constructing random\ngalaxy samples. For each confirmed system we select 1000\ngalaxy samples from the entire galaxy catalogue with\nthe same size as the confirmed system. The \"tilted histograms\" of these randomly selected galaxy samples are\nanalyzed in the same way as the data and we determine\n\n\fL.F.

Distribution of red sequence S/N values for 1000\nrandom galaxy samples for three different redshifts.\nhow frequently we encounter a peak with at least the same\nnumber of galaxies as found in the peak of the data. The\ndefinition of the significance, \u03c3spec , is analagous to that\nabove. In this case, we define the threshold for considering a red sequence real to be \u03c3spec \u2265 99%. The histograms\nwith the highest peaks are shown in the right panels of\nFig 11.\n\n4.5.4. Results\nFrom the application to the photometric data we find 10\nsystems (\u223c 35%) that show signs of a red sequence, while\nwe identify 17 systems (\u223c 55%) when the spectroscopic\nsample is used. Interestingly, all but one of the systems\nfor which a red sequence was identified from the photometric data are confirmed by the spectroscopic analysis. Moreover, the colours determined by the two methods\nyield comparable results. The colours obtained for the red\nsequences (see Fig. 18 below) are consistent with the passive evolution model by Bruzual & Charlot (1993). The\nonly system which was not confirmed by the spectroscopic\nanalysis is EISJ0951-2145 (#12) which is one of the cluster fields with the lowest completeness (0.17) in terms of\ntargeted galaxies.\nOn the other hand, we find 8 systems where a red\nsequence was found in the spectroscopic sample but not\nfrom the photometric sample alone. Curiously, in only one\ncase (EISJ0955-2020, #23) have we found, in Sect. 3, that\nthe system was significantly affected by projection effects.\nIn summary, a total of 18 systems show evidence of\nhaving a red sequence. We find 10 systems from the photometric data alone and 17 from the spectroscopic analysis\nwith 9 systems being in common.\nFor the systems with red sequences detected from the\nspectroscopic analysis we computed the scatter of the\ngalaxy colours using an iterative sigma-clipping method.\nThe scatter is given in Col. 12 of Table 5 and shown in\nFig. 13 (solid line). It ranges from 0.031 to 0.35 mag. For\ncomparison, we also show the distribution of scatter mea-\n\n21\n\nFig. 13. Distribution of the measured scatter around\nthe red sequences (solid line) compared to that of\nL\u00f3pez-Cruz et al. (2004) (dashed line).\nsured in (B-R) by L\u00f3pez-Cruz et al. (2004) scaled to the\nsame total number of clusters. This will be discussed in\nmore detail below.\n\n4.6. Comparison with other authors\nIn Fig. 7 we compare the normalized distributions of velocity dispersions of the EIS systems (solid line) with those\nof the cluster samples considered by Fadda et al. (1996)\n(dotted line) and Zabludoff et al. (1990) (dashed line),\nboth drawn from the Abell cluster catalogue. Both of these\nsamples cover roughly the same redshift range z . 0.15.\nThe Fadda et al. sample includes 172 clusters with richness as poor as R = \u22121, while that of Zabludoff et al.\nconsists of 65 clusters most of which have richness R \u2265 1.\nFrom the figure we find that the EIS systems span about\nthe same range of velocity dispersion as the other samples,\nbut apparently with a larger fraction of low velocity dispersion systems. Applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test,\nwe find that this difference is significant with only a small\nprobability that our sample is drawn from the same parent\npopulation as the others.\nThe distribution of richness is shown in Fig. 9.\nUnfortunately no similar samples are available for comparison. Instead, we compare, in Fig. 14, the relation between\nvelocity dispersion and richness with that determined by\nBahcall et al. (2003). In the figure the solid line shows\nthe relation obtained by Bahcall et al., with the dashed\nlines indicating the estimated uncertainty interval. This\nrelation was derived using 20 well-sampled clusters drawn\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data by a matched filter\nalgorithm. From the figure we find that, except for a few\ncases at the low richness end, the EIS systems populate\nthe same region of the plot. However, considering all systems, we find only a weak correlation between these global\nparameters, perhaps indicating that effects of projection\nand outliers contaminate the measurements of the richness\nand velociy dispersion. We point out that, in their anal-\n\n\f22\n\nL.F. Olsen et al.: Multi-object spectroscopy of low redshift EIS clusters. III.\n\nFig. 14.

(2003) with the dashed lines marking its uncertainty.\n\ntems with measured scatters larger than 0.2mag we obtain\na mean scatter of 0.079 mag, in excellent agreement with\nthe results of L\u00f3pez-Cruz et al. (2004), who found a scatter of 0.074 \u00b1 0.026 mag. With the exception of one of\nthe four outlying systems all have highly complete spectroscopic data. In Fig. 15 we show the measured scatter as\nfunction of redshift. It can be seen that the four outlying\nsystems are all found at redshifts z \u2265 0.23. All the systems\nbut the one with incomplete spectroscopic data have concentration indices C > 0.5, which corresponds to concentrated systems using the definition of Butcher & Oemler\n(1984). A possible interpretation for this larger scatter for\nthese higher redshift systems is that they have bright blue\ncluster members, reminiscent of the Butcher-Oemler effect\n(Butcher & Oemler 1984). The onset of this is thought to\nhappen at redshift z \u223c 0.1 with the fraction of blue galaxies increasing from fB \u223c 0.03 to fB \u223c 0.25 at z = 0.5\nin compact, concentrated clusters. Without morphological information, the origin of this scatter cannot be determined.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nFig. 15. The colour dispersion as function of redshift for\nall systems with a red sequence identified in the spectroscopic analysis.\nysis, Bahcall et al. (2003) only considered richer systems\n(\u039b \u2265 30).\nIn Fig. 10 we show the distribution of concentration indices for our clusters and for those of Butcher & Oemler\n(1984). It can be seen that the EIS sample covers a larger\nrange of concentration indices than that of Butcher and\nOemler. We find a mean concentration of hCiEIS = 0.56\nwith a standard deviation of 0.21, larger than the one\nfound by Butcher & Oemler (hCiBO = 0.47 with a standard deviation of 0.10), indicating that our sample includes more concentrated systems.\nIn Fig. 13 the distribution of the scatter about the CM\nrelation for the 17 systems having a red sequence detected\nusing the spectroscopic sample is shown and compared to\nthat of L\u00f3pez-Cruz et al. (2004). Considering all our systems we find a mean scatter of 0.13 \u00b1 0.10, where the\nerror is the standard deviation. Discarding the four sys-\n\nTo better understand the relation between the existence\nof a red sequence and the global properties of the galaxy\ncluster/ group, here we focus on the 17 clusters with red\nsequences and compare their properties to those found for\nthe entire sample in Fig. 16. The left panel gives the distribution of velocity dispersion, the middle panel that of\nrichness and the right panel that of concentration index. In\nall panels the distribution for the entire sample is shown\n(solid line), while that for the red-sequence systems are\nrepresented by the gray histogram. From the figure, we\nconclude that the red sequences are found in rich, highvelocity dispersion systems, but their existence is independent of the concentration.\nIn Fig. 17 we show the richness-velocity dispersion relation of Bahcall et al. (2003), discussed in the previous\nsection, considering only the red-sequence systems. Except\nfor two low-richness systems, all of them fall within the\nregion indicated by the Bahcall et al. relation. The correlation found for the 15 systems with \u039bcl,new \u2265 20 is 0.29,\nwith a fitted relation of \u03c3v = 73\u039b0.55\ncl,new .\nFinally, in Fig. 18 we compare our measured red sequence colours as a function of redshift with those predicted by two different models. The two models represent passively evolving (thick line) and non-evolving\n(thin line) elliptical galaxies. The passive evolution model\nis based on the model by Bruzual & Charlot (1993)\nwith a formation redshift zf = 10 with a short starburst followed by passive evolution. The colours for the\nnon-evolving elliptical galaxy are computed from the\ncomposite elliptical spectrum from Kinney et al. (1996).\nThe data points seem to be consistent with the passive evolution model, as has also been found by previous\nwork (e.g. Arag\u00f3n-Salamanca et al. 1993; Gladders et al.\n1998; Stanford et al. 1998; Olsen et al. 2001). The scatter around the passive evolution model is computed to be\n\n\fL.F. Olsen et al.: Multi-object spectroscopy of low redshift EIS clusters. III.\n\n23\n\nFig. 16.

Summary\nIn this paper we report new redshifts for 738 galaxies in\nthe field of 21 low-redshift (zMF = 0.2) candidate clusters drawn from the EIS candidate cluster sample. These\ndata were used to search for overdensities in redshift space,\nthus confirming the presence of a bound group/cluster\nof galaxies in the direction of candidates identified by\nthe matched-filter analysis. The photometric and spectroscopic data available for the 20 new confirmed clusters out of 21 candidate systems, as well as those listed\nin the previous papers of this series (Hansen et al. 2002;\nOlsen et al. 2003), were used to compute the properties of\nthese systems and member galaxies. Our main results can\nbe summarized as follows:\n1. For 32 (94%) of 34 systems considered we identify significant density enhancements in redshift space. We\nfind that the measured redshifts are in the range\n0.06 \u2264 z \u2264 0.28, with a mean value of z = 0.18. This\n\nFig. 18.

The lines mark the no-evolution (thin line) and the\npassive evolution (thick line) predictions.\n\nis in excellent agreement with the redshift estimated\nby the matched filter technique.\n2. The systems have a broad range of properties. The velocity dispersions range from small groups (130km/s)\nto clusters (1200km/s), the richness tends to be low\nand the concentration varies from uniform, typical of\nspiral-dominated systems to highly concentrated, typical of early-type dominated systems. The fact that\nthe systems are predominantly poor is not surprising\ngiven the relatively small volume of space probed by\nthe survey.\n3. We estimate that 13 out of the 32 systems may suffer\nfrom projection effects either due to other superposed\ngalaxy systems along the line-of-sight or to field galaxies, which may impact the calculation of the system's\nglobal properties and explain the weak correlation observed between velocity dispersion and richness.\n4. We find that 17 (60%) out of 29 systems with both\nphotometric and spectroscopic data available show evidence of a red sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram, with colours consistent with those predicted\nfrom passively evolving stellar populations.

III.\n\nsystem with a detected red sequence using photometric data was not confirmed when only spectroscopic\nmembers were considered.\n5. The systems where red sequences have been detected\ntend to have higher velocity dispersions and richnesses\nthan those without. However, these systems seem to\nbe independent of the concentration index.\nThe presence of a red sequence is consistent with\nthe interpretation that we have detected bound systems\ncontaining elliptical galaxies that obey a scaling massmetallicity relation which gives rise to the observed CMrelation. Therefore, these results taken together with the\ndetection of density enhancements in redshift space provide further evidence that the systems detected by the\nmatched-filter technique at z=0.2 are nearly all real.\nExtending the sample of measured redshifts would greatly\nhelp in further characterizing these systems, typically at\nthe low end of the Abell richness.\nAcknowledgements.
