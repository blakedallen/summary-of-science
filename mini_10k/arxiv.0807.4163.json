Not\nonly should it repli ate in a uni\u001ced way all the empiri al statisti al regularities, often alled\nstylized fa ts, ( f e.g. Bou haud and Potters [15\u2104, Cont [21\u2104), but it should also be easy to\nalibrate and analyti ally tra table, so as to fa ilitate its appli ation to derivative pri ing and\n\u001cnan ial risk assessment. Up to now none of the proposed models has been able to meet all\nthese requirements despite their variety. Attempts in lude ARCH family (Bollerslev et al.\n[10\u2104, Tsay [50\u2104 and referen es therein), sto hasti volatility (Musiela and Rutkowski [41\u2104\nand referen es therein), multifra tal models (Ba ry et al. [1\u2104, Borland et al. [13\u2104, Eisler and\nKert\u00e9sz [27\u2104, Mandelbrot et al. [39\u2104 and referen es therein), multi-times ale models (Borland\nand Bou haud [12\u2104, Zumba h [54\u2104, Zumba h et al. [56\u2104), L\u00e9vy pro esses (Cont and Tankov\n[22\u2104 and referen es therein), and self-similar pro esses (Carr et al. [18\u2104).\nRe ently Baldovin and Stella (B-S thereafter) proposed a new way of addressing the\nquestion. We advise the reader to refer to the original papers Baldovin and Stella [4, 5, 6\u2104\nfor a full des ription of the model as we shall only give a brief a ount of its main underlying\nprin iples. Using their notation let S(t) be the value of the asset under onsideration at time\nt, the logarithmi return over the interval [t, t + \u03b4t] is given by rt,\u03b4t = ln S(t + \u03b4t) \u2212 ln S(t);\n\nthe elementary time unit is a day, i.e., t = 0, 1, . . . and \u03b4t = 1, 2, . . . days. In order to\na ommodate for non-stationary features, the distribution of rt,\u03b4t is denoted by Pt,\u03b4t (r) whi h\nontains an expli it dependen e on t. The most impressive a hievement of B-S is to build\n(n)\nthe multivariate distribution P0,1\n(r0,1 , . . . , rn,1 ) of n onse utive daily returns starting from\n\nthe univariate distribution of a single day provided that the following onditions hold:\n1. No trivial arbitrage: the returns are linearly independent, i.e. E(ri,1 , rj,1) = 0 for\ni 6= j , with the standard ondition E(ri,1 ) = 0.\n\n2. Possibly anomalous s aling of the return distribution with respe t to the time interval\n\u03b4t, with exponent D :\n\n\u0010 r \u0011\n1\nP0,\u03b4t (r) = D P0,1\n.\n\u03b4t\n\u03b4tD\n\n3. Identi al form of the un onditional distributions of the daily returns up to a possible\ndependen e of the varian e on the time t, i.e.\n1\nPt,1 (r) = P0,1\nat\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nat\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n\fAs shown in the addendum of Baldovin and Stella [5\u2104 these onditions admit the solution\n(n)\n\nf0,1 (k1 , . . . , kn ) = g\u0303(\n\nq\n\n(1)\n\n2\n2D 2\na2D\n1 k1 + * * * + an kn ),\n\n(n)\n(n)\nis the hara teristi fun tion of P0,1\n, g\u0303 the hara teristi fun tion of P0,1 , and\nwhere f0,1\n\na2D\n= i2D \u2212 (i \u2212 1)2D . In this way the full pro ess is entirely determined by the hoi e of\ni\n\nthe s aling exponent D and the distribution P0,1 . Therefore the hara teristi fun tion of\nPt,\u03b4t (r) is\n(n)\n\nft,T (k) = f0,1 (0, . . . , 0, k, . . . , k, 0, . . . , 0) = g\u0303(k\n| {z } | {z }\nt terms\n\ni.e.\n\nPt,\u03b4t (r) = p\n\n\u03b4t terms\n\n1\n(t + \u03b4t)2D \u2212 t2D\n\nP0,1\n\np\n(t + \u03b4t)2D \u2212 t2D ),\nr\n\np\n\n(t + \u03b4t)2D \u2212 t2D\n\n!\n\n.\n\nThe fun tional form of g\u0303 in Eq. (1) introdu es a dependen e between the un onditional\nmarginal distributions of the daily returns by the means of a generalized multipli ation \u2297\n\nin the spa e of hara teristi fun tions, i.e.,\n(n)\n\nD\nf0,1 (k1 , . . . , kn ) = g\u0303(aD\n1 k1 ) \u2297g\u0303 * * * \u2297g\u0303 g\u0303(an kn ),\n\nwith \u2297g\u0303 de\u001cned by\n\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\n2\nx \u2297g\u0303 y = g\u0303\n[g\u0303 (x)] + [g\u0303 (y)] .\n\n(2)\n\nAt \u001crst sight this last equation may seem a trivial identity, but it does hide a powerful\nstatement. Suppose indeed that instead of starting with the probability distribution g\u0303, one\ntakes a general distribution with \u001cnite varian e \u03c3 2 = 2 and hara teristi fun tion p\u03031 , then\nit is shown in Baldovin and Stella [4\u2104 that\nlim p\u03031\n|\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\nk\n\u221a\nN\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2297g\u0303 * * * \u2297g\u0303 p\u03031\n{z\nN terms\n\n\u0012\n\nk\n\u221a\nN\n\n\u0013\n\n= g\u0303(k).\n\n(3)\n\n}\n\nThis means that in this framework the return distribution at large s ales is independent\nof the distribution of the returns at mi ros opi s ales: it is ompletely determined by\nthe orrelation introdu ed by the multipli ation \u2297g\u0303 , with \u001cxed point g\u0303. Note that if g\u0303 is\nthe hara teristi fun tion of the Gaussian distribution, then \u2297g\u0303 redu es to the standard\n\nmultipli ation and one re overs the standard Central Theorem Limit.\n3\n\n\fAs the volatility of the model shrinks in an inexorable way, Baldovin and Stella propose\nto restart the whole shrinking pro ess after a riti al time \u03c4c long enough for the volatility\nauto orrelation to fall to the noise level. In this way one re overs a sort of stationary time\nseries when their length is mu h greater than \u03c4c . In this ase one expe ts that the empiri al\ndistribution of the return P\u0304\u03b4t (r) over a time horizon \u03b4t \u226a \u03c4c , evaluated with a sliding window\nsatis\u001ces\n\n\u03c4c \u22121\n1 X\nPt,\u03b4t (r).\nP\u0304\u03b4t (r) =\n\u03c4c t=0\n\n(4)\n\nIn the original papers no market me hanism is proposed for modeling the restart of the\npro ess; it is simply stated that the length of di\u001berent runs and the starting points of the\npro esses ould be sto hasti variables. In their simulations the length of the pro esses was\n\u001cxed to \u03c4 = 500, whi h orresponds to slightly more than two years of daily data.\nII.\n\nA FULLY EXPLICIT THEORY WITH STUDENT DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nIn Baldovin and Stella [5\u2104 a power law trun ated L\u00e9vy distribution is hosen to des ribe\nthe returns\ng\u0303(k) = exp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212Bk 2\n1 + C\u03b1 k 2\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nIn Sokolov et al. [47\u2104 it is shown that this expression is indeed the hara teristi fun tion\nof a probability density with power law tails whose exponent is exponent 5 \u2212 \u03b1. How-\n\never, this hoi e is problemati in two respe ts: its inverse Fourier annot be omputed\nexpli itly, whi h prevents a fully expli it theory. In addition, for Eq. (1) to be onsistent,\ng\u0303(\n\np\n\nk12 + * * * + kn2 ) must be the hara teristi fun tion of a multivariate probability density\n\nfor all n. In Baldovin and Stella [5\u2104 only numeri al he ks are performed to verify this property. But as dis ussed for example in Bou haud and Potters [15\u2104 both trun ated L\u00e9vy and\nStudent distributions yield a eptable \u001cts of the returns on medium and small time s ales.\nIn the present ontext, the Student distribution, sometimes referred to as q -Gaussian in the\nase of non-integer degrees of freedom, is a better hoi e; it provides analyti tra tability\nwhile \u001ctting equally well real sto k market pri es (see alsoOsorio et al.

As demonstrated in the appendix, the\np\n\ninverse Fourier transform of g\u0303( k12 + * * * + kn2 ) for any integer n is simply the multivariate\n\nStudent distribution (see also Vignat and Plastino [52\u2104).

As shown in the appendix, its hara teristi fun tion is given for any n by\n\u221a\n\u03bd\nK \u03bd2 ( \u03b12 + k 2 ) (\u03b12 + k 2 ) 4\nf \u0303n (k) =\n\u03bd\nK \u03bd2 (\u03b1)\n\u03b12\n\nwith k =\n\npPn\n\ni=1\n\nki2 .\n\nIn the following we restri t the dis ussion to the Student distributions. Hen e we assume\nthat the distribution of the return is given by Eq. (7) with hara teristi fun tion given by\nEq. (6), where \u039b is a diagonal matrix\nk=\n\n\u221a\n\nkt \u039bk\n\nq\n2\n= \u03bb k02 + (22D \u2212 1)k12 + * * * + (n2D \u2212 (n \u2212 1)2D )kn\u22121\n\nand \u03bb2 governs the varian e of the returns on the time s ale hosen as a referen e. Thanks\nto the fa t that the diagonal elements of \u039b form a teles oping series the pro ess is indeed\nonsistent for any number of dis rete steps. Moreover it an be generalized to the ontinuous\ntime by setting, in the same onsistent way,\nP(r0,\u2206t0 , rt1 ,\u2206t1 , . . . , rtn\u22121 ,\u2206tn\u22121 )\n\n2D\n2D\n2D\n2D\n= gn(\u03bd) (r0,\u2206t0 , rt1 ,\u2206t1 , . . . , rtn\u22121 ,\u2206tn\u22121 , \u039b = diag(t2D\n1 , t2 \u2212 t1 , . . . , tn \u2212 tn\u22121 )), (8)\n\nwhere tj =\n\nPj\u22121\ni=0\n\n2D\n2D\n2D\n2D\n\u2206ti , j \u2265 1 and now \u039b = diag(t2D\n1 , t2 \u2212 t1 , . . . , tn \u2212 tn\u22121 ). The existen e\n\nof the ontinuum pro ess is then guaranteed by the Kolmogorov extension theorem. Starting\nfrom this expression a wider lass of pro esses an be generated by suitable transformations\nfor any monotoni ally in reasing\nof the time, i.e., by substituting the fun tion ti \u2192 t2D\ni\nontinuous fun tion ti \u2192 T (ti ). The pro ess followed by the pri e x(t) = ln S(t) is a Student\n\npro ess too, with same exponent \u03bd and non diagonal matrix \u039bij = (\u22121)i+j T (tmin(i,j) ).\n\nThe Student setting makes easier to interpret the orrelations indu ed by the pointwise\nnon-standard produ t of (2) in the hara teristi fun tion spa e.

[20\u2104, Malevergne and Sornette\n[38\u2104). A pi ture of this opula density with \u03bd = 3 and \u039b the identity matrix is given in\nFig. 2. Although Student and generalized hyperboli distributions are usually adopted for\nmodeling returns of several assets over the same time intervals, the framework proposed by\nBaldovin and Stella allow them to model the returns of a single asset over di\u001berent time\nintervals.\n\n7\n\n\fIII.\n\nTHE BALDOVIN-STELLA PROCESS AS MULTIVARIATE NORMAL VARI-\n\nANCE MIXTURES\n\nA ording to the B-S framework we have to look for fun tions \u03c6 : R \u2192 C, su h that\n\ng\u0303n : Rn \u2192 C with g\u0303n (k1 , k2 , . . . , kn ) = \u03c6(k12 + k22 + * * * + kn2 ) is the hara teristi fun tion of a\n\nprobability distribution for any n. Then from Eq. (8) we obtain a unique sto hasti pro ess\n\nwith a well-de\u001cned ontinuous limit.\nB-S pro esses an be fully hara terized if one regards their \u001cnite dimensional marginals\nas instan es of multivariate normal varian e mixtures U = \u03c3N , where \u03c3 is an univariate\nrandom variable with positive values, \u03c3 2 having umulative distribution G, and N is an\nn-dimensional normal random variable independent from \u03c3 . Leaving aside trivial a\u001ene\n\nhanges of variables, we an assume that the ovarian e matrix of N is the identity matrix.\nBy \u001crst onditioning its evaluation on the value of \u03c3 , and then omputing its mean over \u03c3 ,\nit is immediate to see that the hara teristi fun tion g\u0303nU (k1 , k2 , . . . , kn) of U is\ng\u0303nU (k1 , k2 , . . . , kn )\n\n= \u03c6\u03c3 2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1 2\n2\n2\n(k + k2 + * * * + kn ) ,\n2 1\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03c32 (s) is the Lapla e transform asso iated to G\n\u0002\n\n\u221e\n\ndx e\u2212sx dG(x).\n\n\u03c6\u03c32 (s) =\n0\n\nAs this onstru tion is independent from n, an admissible hoi e for \u03c6 is \u03c6(s) = \u03c6\u03c32 ( 2s ), where\n\u03c6\u03c32 is the Lapla e transform asso iated to any random variable \u03c3 2 with positive values.\n\nThe ru ial point is that by S hoenberg's theorem in S hoenberg [46\u2104 (see also the selfontained dis ussion about normal varian e mixtures in Bingham and Kiesel [9\u2104) this family\nexhausts all the possible hoi es, i.e. \u03c6(k12 + k22 + * * * + kn2 ) is a hara teristi fun tion of a\n\nprobability distribution for any n if and only if \u03c6(s) is the Lapla e transform a univariate\n\nrandom variable with positive values.\nHen e a multivariate distribution for the returns an be built in the B-S framework if\nand only if it admits a representation as a normal varian e mixture.\nIn passing we note that the hoi e of B-S in their original papers for the distribution (5)\nis indeed admissible, as in Sokolov et al. [47\u2104 it is shown that\n\u03c6S (s) = exp\n\n\u0012\n\n8\n\n\u2212Bs\n1 + C\u03b1 s1\u2212\u03b1/2\n\n\u0013\n\n\fis ompletely monotone, hen e a Lapla e transform by the virtue of Bernstein's theorem.\nNow it is immediate to see that all the sto hasti pro esses Xt\u03c3 (\u03c9) that an arise in the B-S\nframework admit the following representation on a suitably hosen sto hasti basis (\u03a9, F , P),\n\nover whi h a positive random variable \u03c3(\u03c9) and a Wiener pro ess Wt (\u03c9) independent from\n\u03c3 are de\u001cned:\nXt\u03c3 (\u03c9) = \u03c3(\u03c9)Wt2D (\u03c9) .\n\n(9)\n\nWe only have to show that the \u001cnite dimensional marginal laws of Xt\u03c3 (\u03c9) are the same as\nthose arising from (8). Indeed if we \u001crst evaluate the expe tations over W , onditional on\n\u03c3 , we will obtain a Gaussian multivariate distribution\nP(Xt1 , Xt2 , . . . , Xtn | \u03c3)\n\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\nXt1 (Xt2 \u2212 Xt1 )2\n(Xtn \u2212 Xtn\u22121 )2\n1\n1\n=\n+ 2D\n+***+\n;\nn exp \u2212\n2D\n2\u03c3 2 t2D\nt2 \u2212 t2D\nt2D\n(2\u03c0\u03c3 2 ) 2\n1\n1\nn \u2212 tn\u22121\n\nthe eventual average over \u03c3 will then lead to the same multivariate normal varian e mixtures\nas in (8), with the appropriate ovarian e matrix (just note that \u2206ti = ti+1 \u2212 ti , and\n\nri,\u2206ti = Xti+1 \u2212 Xti ). In parti ular, the pro esses introdu ed in Se . II orrespond to an\n\ninverse Gamma distribution of \u03c3 2 in the Student ase, and a Generalized Inverse Gaussian\ndistribution in the hyperboli\n\nase.\n\nThe sto hasti di\u001berential equation obeyed by (9) is\n1\n\ndXt\u03c3 (\u03c9) = \u03c3(\u03c9)tD\u2212 2 dWt ,\n\nThis equation shows that the volatility of the pro esses admissible in the B-S framework\nhas a deterministi time dynami , and that its sour e of randomness is just as ribable to its\ninitial value.\nEventually we an on lude that a sto hasti pro ess is ompatible with the B-S framework if and only if it is a varian e mixture of Wiener pro esses whose varian e is distributed\na ording an arbitrary positive law, with a deterministi power law time hange. This explains why using use this framework to model real pri e returns, one inevitably has to assume\nthat the real pri e dynami s is omposed by sequen es of di\u001berent realizations, as done by\nB-S. This is ne essary not only be ause otherwise the model would predi t a persistent and\ndeterministi volatility de ay for D < 1/2, but also be ause \u03c3 is \u001cxed in ea h realization.\nThe limitations of this kind of models in des ribing real returns will be made more manifest\nin the following se tion, but now we already know their mathemati al foundations.\n9\n\n\fThe asset pri es an be modeled in an obvious arbitrage free way\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 2\n2D\n,\nS(t, \u03c9) = S0 exp rt + \u03c3(\u03c9)Wt2D (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c3 (\u03c9)t\n2\n\nwith r the \u001cxed default free interest rate, and where we left the dependen e on \u03c9 expli it in\norder to emphasise the fa t that \u03c3 is a random variable. The pri ing of options is then the\nsame as in the Bla k-S holes model, with an additional average over \u03c3(\u03c9). For instan e the\npri e C(T, K) of a all option with maturity T and strike K is\nC(T, K) = S0 E\u03c3 (N(d1 )) \u2212 e\u2212rT KE\u03c3 (N(d2 )) ,\n\nwith as usual N is the normal umulative distribution,\nln SK0 + rt + 12 \u03c3 2 t2D\n,\nd1 =\n\u03c3tD\nln S0 + rt \u2212 21 \u03c3 2 t2D\n,\nd2 = K\n\u03c3tD\n\nand the additional expe tation E\u03c3 has to be evaluated a ording to the distribution of \u03c3.\nIV.\n\nAPPLICABILITY OF THIS FRAMEWORK TO REAL MARKETS\n\nThe axiomati nature of the derivation of Baldovin and Stella is elegant and powerful:\nits ability to build mathemati ally multivariate pri e return distributions from a univariate\ndistribution using only a few reasonable assumptions is impressive. Nevertheless, as stated\nin the introdu tion, a model of pri e dynami s must meet many requirements in order to be\nboth relevant and useful. In this se tion, we examine its dynami s thoroughly.\nA.\n\nVolatility dynami s\n\nIn Fig. 3.a we report the results of three simulations of the return pro ess, ea h one of\n500 steps and with parameters \u03bd = 3.2 and D = 0.20. In ea h run the volatility de ays\ninelu tably, as explained in the previous se tion. Indeed by \u001cxing the time interval \u03b4ti = 1,\nwe see from Eq. (8) that the un onditional volatility of the rt,1 returns is proportional to\np\n\n(t + 1)2D \u2212 t2D , i.e., to tD\u22121/2 for t \u226b 1: the un onditional volatility de reases if D < 1/2\n\nand in reases if D > 1/2, in both ases a ording to a power law. This appears quite learly\nin Fig. 3.b, where we have omputed the mean volatility de ay, measured as the absolute\n10\n\n\fVolatility decay\n\n0.02\n\n<|rt, 1|>\n\n0.00\n\nt(D\u22121 2)\n\n\u22120.10\n\n0.01\n\n\u22120.05\n\nrt, 1\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.15\n\nProcess simulation\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\nt\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\n500\n\nt\n\n(a) Three simulations, ea h 500 steps long.\n\n(b) De ay of the volatility: average over 10000 simulation,\nea h 500 steps long. The dashed line represents the\nanalyti predi tion.\n\nFigure 3: Pro ess simulation with \u03bd = 3.2, D = 0.20, and \u03bb = 0.107.\nvalues of the return, over 10000 pro ess simulations. The parameters of the distributions\nhave been hosen lose to those representing real returns (see below).\nThe onditional volatility an be easily omputed: the distribution of the return rn,1\nonditioned to the previous return realizations r0,1 , . . . , rn\u22121,1 is again a Student distribution\nwith exponent \u03bd\u2032 = \u03bd + n and onditional varian e\n[(n + 1)2D \u2212 n2D ] 1 +\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n2\nri,1\n(i + 1)2D \u2212 i2D\n\n!\n\n.\n\nFrom this expression it is lear that volatility spikes in a given realisation of the pro ess\ntend to be persistent (see Fig. 3.a); this is the main reason why \u001du tuation patterns di\u001ber\nmu h from one run to an other. This an be also understood by appealing to the hara terization of this kind of pro esses we did in Se . III: ea h single run is just a realization of a\nWiener pro ess, whose varian e is hosen at the beginning a ording to an Inverse Gamma\ndistribution R\u0393( \u03bd2 , \u03bb2 ), and that de ays in time a ording to the deterministi law tD\u2212 2 .\n1\n\n11\n\n\fB.\n\nDe reasing volatility and restarts\n\nThe very \u001crst model introdu ed by B-S has onstant volatility, whi h orresponds to \u039b\nbeing a multiple of the identity matrix. This unfortunate feature is the main reason behind\nthe introdu tion of weights, whose e\u001be t is akin to an algebrai stret hing of the time, or, as\nput forward by B-S, to a time renormalization. This in turn auses a deterministi algebrai\nde rease of the expe tation of the volatility, as explained above and depi ted in Fig. 3.b;\nhen e the need for restarts, ea h attributed to an external ause.\nAlthough this dynami s may seem quite pe uliar, su h restarts are found at market\nrashes, like the re ent one of O tober 2008, whi h are followed by periods of algebrai ally\nde aying volatility. This leads to an analogous of the Omori law for earthquakes, as reported\nin Lillo and Mantegna [36\u2104 and Weber et al. [53\u2104. The B-S model, by onstru tion, is able\nto reprodu e this e\u001be t in a faithfully way. In Fig. 4 the umulative number of times the\nabsolute value of the returns N(t) ex eeds a given thresholds is depi ted, for a single simulation of the pro ess and three di\u001berent value of the threshold. The \u001ct with the predi tion\nof the Omori law N(t) = K(t + t0 )\u03b1 \u2212 Kt\u03b10 is evident.\n\nCrashes are good restart andidates: they provide learly de\u001cned events that syn hronize\n\nall the traders' a tions. In that view, they provide an other indire t way to measure the\ndistribution of times ales of traders, whi h are thought to be power-law distributed (Lillo\n[35\u2104).\nAnother example of algebrai ally de reasing volatility was re ently reported by M Cauley\net al. [40\u2104 in foreign ex hange markets in whi h trading is performed around the lo k. Understandably, when a given market zone (Asia, Europe, Ameri a) opens, an in rease of a tivity\nis seen, and vi e-versa. Spe i\u001c ally, this work \u001cts the de rease of a tivity orresponding to\nthe afternoon trading session in the USA with a power-law and \u001cnds an algebrai de ay with\nexponent \u03b7 = 0.35; this is exa tly the same behavior as the one of B-S model between two\nrestarts, with D = 1 \u2212 2\u03b7 = 0.3. No explanation of why the trading a tivity should result in\n\nthis spe i\u001c type of de ay has been put forward in our knowledge. In this ase the starting\ntime of the volatility de ay orresponds to the maximum of a tivity of US markets.\n\n12\n\n\fOmori law\n\n300\n\n400\n\nl = 1.8\u03c3\n\n200\n\n\u03b1 = 0.44\n\u03b1 = 0.35\n\u03b1 = 0.25\n\n0\n\nl = 2.4\u03c3\n\n100\n\nN(t)\n\nl = 2.1\u03c3\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nt\n\nFigure 4: Omori law for a single run of the pro ess, with D = 0.20, \u03bd = 0.32.

The dashed lines represents the \u001ct with the Omori law\nN(t) = K(t + t0 )\u03b1 \u2212 Kt\u03b10 .\nC.\n\nApparent multifra tality\n\nThe Baldovin and Stella model is able to reprodu e the apparent multifra tal hara teristi s of the real returns, i.e. the shape of \u03b6(q) where h|r\u03b4t |q i = \u03b4t\u03b6(q) .\n\nThe expe tation is evaluated a ording the distribution (4), i.e. taking the mean over\n\nindependent runs of the pro ess.

Unfortunately a value of \u03c4c that large is di\u001e ult\nto justify, as in the ase of S&P 500 we have only 14956 daily returns, i.e. less than three\n13\n\n\fScaling exponents\n\n1.5\n\nPrediction\nSimulations\n\n1.0\n\n\u03b6(q)\n\n1.0\n\n\u03b6(q)\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nScaling exponents\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nS&P 500\nFit with \u03c4c = 5376, D = 0.21245\nFit with \u03c4c = 500, D = 0.21969\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1\n\nq\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nq\n\n(a) Fitting of the empiri al exponents of real data.\n\n(b) Theoreti al predi tion ompared to 5 simulations done\nwith the same parameters.\n\nFigure 5: S aling exponents: S&P 500 data and simulations ompared with theoreti al\npredi tion. All the simulations have been done with the same parameters: 30 runs of 500\nsteps, with \u03bd = 3.2, D = 0.220\nruns of a pro ess with su h a length. The other \u001ct is obtained by \u001crst \u001cxing \u03c4c = 500, as in\nBaldovin and Stella [5\u2104 and yields D = 0.220.\nThe statisti al signi\u001c an e of this approa h seems anyway questionable. In Fig. 5.b we\nompare the theoreti al expe tation of the exponents with simulations. We hoose the\nparameters \u03c4c = 500, D = 0.220 both for simulations and analyti model, with \u03bd = 3.22.\nThe number of restarts in the simulation is 30 in order to have a number of data points\nsimilar to the S&P 500. It is evident that the exponents evaluated from the simulated data\nhave a really large varian e.\nThe problem is that if the tail exponent \u03bd = 3.22, from an analyti perspe tive the moments with q > 3.22 are in\u001cnite, hen e, should not be taken into a ount in the multifra tal\nanalysis (for an analyti treatment of multifra tal analysis see Ja\u001bard [32, 33\u2104, Riedi [45\u2104).\nThe situation is somehow di\u001berent in the ase of multifra tal models of asset returns (Ba ry\n14\n\n\fet al. [2\u2104, Mandelbrot et al. [39\u2104), where the theoreti al predi tion of the tail exponents of the\nreturn distribution is relatively high (see the review of Borland et al. [13\u2104), and the moments\nusually empiri ally measured do exist even from the analyti point of view. For attempts\nto re on ile the theoreti al predi tions of the multifra tal models with real data see Ba ry\net al. [3\u2104 and Muzy et al. [42\u2104.\nIt is worth remembering that the anomalous s aling of the empiri al return moments\ndoes not imply that the return series has to be des ribed by a multifra tal model, as already\npointed out some time ago in Bou haud [14\u2104 and Bou haud et al. [16\u2104: the long memory of\nthe volatility is responsible at least in part for the deviation from trivial s aling. A more\ndetailed analysis of real data reported in Jiang and Zhou [34\u2104 seems indeed to ex lude evident\nmultifra tal properties of the pri e series.\nV.\n\nMISSING FEATURES\n\nSin e in this model the volatility is onstant in ea h realization and bound to de rease\nunless a restart o urs, it is quite lear that it does not ontain all the ri hness of \u001cnan ial\nmarket pri e dynami s. Restarting the whole pro ess is not entirely satisfa tory, as in\nreality the in rease of volatility is not always due to an external sho k. Volatility does\noften gradually build up through a feedba k loop that is absent from the B-S me hanism.\nThus, large events and rashes an also have a endogenous ause, e.g. due to the in\u001duen e of\ntraders that base their de isions on previous pri es or volatility, su h as te hni al analysts\nor hedgers. A quantitative des ription of this kind of phenomena is attempted for instan e\nin Sornette [48\u2104, Sornette et al. [49\u2104, by appealing to dis rete s ale invarian e (see also the\nviewpoint expressed in Chang and Feigenbaum [19\u2104 and referen es therein). This kind of\ne\u001be t is ompletely missing from the original B-S me hanism.\nVolatility build-ups an be simulated with D > 1/2, getting at onstant D the equivalent\nof the inverse Omori law for earthquakes [29\u2104. This kind of dynami s has been reported\nto happen prior to some \u001cnan ial market rashes [49\u2104. At a smaller time s ale, foreign\nex hange intraday volatility patterns have a systemati ally in reasing part whose \u001ct to a\npossibly arbitrary power-law, as performed in M Cauley et al. [40\u2104 (\u03b7 = 0.22), orresponds\nindeed to hoosing D = 0.56. To our knowledge, volatility build-ups either do not follow a\nparti ular and systemati law, or perhaps have not yet been the obje ts of a thorough study.\n15\n\n\fBe ause of the symmetri nature of all the distributions derived above, all the odd moments are zero, hen e, the skewness of real pri es annot be reprodu ed. This shows up well\nin Fig. 3 of Baldovin and Stella [6\u2104. Another onsequen e is that it is impossible to repli ate\nthe leverage e\u001be t, i.e. the negative orrelation between past returns and future volatility,\narefully analyzed in Bou haud et al. [17\u2104.\nIn any ase, the de rease of the \u001du tuations in the B-S pro ess is a deterministi out ome\nof the anomalous s aling law tD with D < 1/2, and results in a strong temporal asymmetry of\nthe orresponding time series. But quite remarkably it misses the time-reversal asymmetry\nreported in Lyn h and Zumba h [37\u2104 and Zumba h [55\u2104. Indeed real \u001cnan ial time series\nare not symmetri under time reversal with respe t to even-order moments. For instan e,\nthere is no leverage e\u001be t in foreign ex hange rates, and their time series are not as skewed\nas indi es, but they do have a time arrow. One of the indi ators proposed in Lyn h and\nZumba h [37\u2104 is the orrelation between histori al volatility \u03c3\u03b4t(h)h (t) and realized volatility\n\u03c3\u03b4tr (t). The histori al volatility series \u03c3\u03b4th (t) represents the volatility omputed using the\n(r)\n\n(h)\n\ndata in the past interval [t \u2212 \u03b4th , t], and \u03c3\u03b4t(r)r (t) represents the volatility omputed using the\n\ndata in the future interval [t, t + \u03b4tr ]; the orrelation between the two series is then analyzed\n\nas a fun tion of both \u03b4tr and \u03b4th . Real \u001cnan ial time series present an asymmetri graph with\nrespe t the hange \u03b4th \u2194 \u03b4ts , with a strong indi ation that histori al volatility at a given\n\ntime s ale \u03b4th is more likely orrelated to realized volatility with time s ale \u03b4tr < \u03b4th , with\npeaks of orrelation at time s ales related to human a tivities. The asymmetry hara teristi\nis absent in the Baldovin and Stella model, as showed in Fig. 6.\nThe strong orrelation between returns guarantees the slow de ay of the volatility but\nindu es some side e\u001be ts. The distribution of the returns in the model is essentially the\nsame with identi al power law exponent for the tails. This happens independently of the\ntime interval \u03b4t over whi h the returns are evaluated, as long as \u03b4t \u226a \u03c4c , with \u03c4c of the order\n\nof hundreds days. Hen e the weekly returns are distributed as the daily returns, while in\n\nreal data the tail exponent begins to in rease in a remarkable way already at the intraday\nlevel (Drozdz et al. [25\u2104). The strong orrelation also slows down the onvergen e to the\nGaussian distribution of the returns when measured on larger time s ale. Even if the kurtosis\nis not de\u001cned analyti ally in prin iple, it is possible to measure the empiri al kurtosis of the\nreturns of a simulated time series and ompare with the kurtosis of real data. In Fig. 7 we\nshow the kurtosis of the return distribution among simulations and daily return of the S&P\n16\n\n\f600\n\n18\n\n0.6\n\n335\n\n0.60\n\n14\n\n188\n11\n\n0.5\n\n105\n\n0.55\n8\n\n59\n\n0.50\n\n5\n\n0.45\n\n4\n\n0.4\n\n33\n\n\u03b4tr\n\n\u03b4tr\n\n6\n\n18\n\n0.3\n\n10\n\n6\n3\n\n0.40\n\n3\n\n0.2\n\n2\n2\n\n0.35\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n11\n\n14\n\n18\n\n1\n\n0.1\n1\n\n\u03b4th\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n10\n\n18\n\n33\n\n59\n\n105\n\n188\n\n335\n\n600\n\n\u03b4th\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6: Correlation between histori al and realized volatility of the simulated pro ess,\nover di\u001berent time interval \u03b4t.

In this \u001cnal se tion we put forward brie\u001dy some qualitative\nproposals of how these issues an be addressed.\nThe volatility dynami s an be improved by introdu ing an appropriate dynami s for\nthe exponent D, i.e. introdu ing a dynami D(t) ontrolling the di\u001busive pro ess. This\nis equivalent to starting with a model with onstant volatility, i.e. with \u039b proportional to\nthe identity matrix, and then introdu ing an appropriate evolution for the time t. This\nte hnique is employed for instan e in the Multifra tal Random Walk model (Ba ry et al.\n17\n\n\f5\n\n10\n\n20\n\nKurtosis excess decay\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03ba(\u03b4t)\n\nS&P 500\nSimulations\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u03b4t\n\nFigure 7: Comparison of the kurtosis of the returns evaluated over a time interval \u03b4t. Ea h\none of the three simulations are omposed by 30 runs, 500 steps long, in order to have a\nlength omparable with that of the S&P 500 returns. The parameters are \u03bd = 3.2,\nD = 0.20, \u03bb = 0.1.\n\n[2\u2104), where the time evolution is driven by a multifra tal pro ess, or when the time evolution\nis modeled by an in reasing L\u00e9vy pro ess (see e.g. Cont and Tankov [22\u2104). In this last ase\nwe would obtain a mixing of Wiener pro esses driven by a subordinator.\nThe la k of skewness is a ommon problem of sto hasti volatility models: one usually\nwrites the return at time t as rt,\u03b4t = \u01eb(t)\u03c3(t), where \u01eb(t) is sign of the return and \u03c3(t) its\namplitude, a symmetri setting if the distribution of \u01eb(t) is even. One remedy found for\ninstan e in Eisler and Kert\u00e9sz [27\u2104 is to bias the sign probabilities while enfor ing a zero\nexpe tation; more pre isely,\nP\n\n\u221a !\n1/ 2\n= 1/2 \u00b1 \u01eb.\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n1/2 \u00b1 \u01eb\n\nAnother possibility for introdu ing skewness is that of onsidering normal mean-varian e\nmixtures, instead of simply normal varian e ones. For instan e, this would have implied the\nuse of the multivariate skewed Student distribution in the model des ribed in Se . II.\nThe de ay of the tail exponent of the return distribution, represented in Fig. 7, ould be\n18\n\n\fimplemented by introdu ing two di\u001berent Student distributions: a univariate with exponent\n\u03bdr for modeling the daily returns, and a multivariate one with a mu h larger exponent \u03bdc\n\nfor modeling the orrelations among them. By taking into a ount the generalized entral\nlimit theorem expressed in Eq. (3), the distribution of returns at intermediate time s ales\nwill interpolate between the two exponents, yielding the desired feature.\nThe Zumba h mugshot is one of the most di\u001e ult stylized fa ts to reprodu e. To our\nknowledge the best results in that respe t was a hieved in Borland and Bou haud [12\u2104, where\na spe i\u001c realization of a quadrati GARCH model is introdu ed, motivated by the di\u001berent\na tivity levels of traders with di\u001berent investment time horizons, whi h take into a ount\nthe return over a large spe trum of time s ales. More spe i\u001c ally Borland and Bou haud\nuse\n\u03c3i2 = \u03c302\n\n#\n2\nri,\u03b4t\n,\ng\u2206t 2\n1+\n\u03c3\n\u03c4\n\u03b4t\n0\n\u03b4t=1\n\n\"\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nwith \u03c4 \u001cxing the time s ale, rt,\u03b4T = ln S(t + \u03b4T ) \u2212 ln S(t), g\u03b4t measuring the impa t on the\n\nvolatility by traders with time horizon \u03b4t, and hosen by the authors g\u03b4t = g/(\u03b4t)\u03b1. This\nexpression is rewritten also in the form\n\u03c3i2 = \u03c302 +\n\nX\n\nj<i,k<i\n\nM(i, j, k)\n\nwith\nM(i, j, k) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nrj rk\n,\n\u03c4\n\n\u2206t=max(i\u2212j,i\u2212k)\n\ng\u03b4t\n.\n\u03b4t\n\nIn the present framework this would orrespond to use a highly non-trivial matrix \u039b,\nintrodu ing linear orrelation among returns at any time lag. This means that the B-S\npro ess would no longer be a model of returns, but of sto hasti volatility.\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWhen employed with self-de omposable distributions like the Student or the Generalized\nHyperboli as introdu ed in Se . II, the resulting des ription of the pro ess return is di\u001berent\nthan that of other models in the literature. First our Student pro ess is not stationary, hen e\ndi\u001berent from the lass of Student pro esses dis ussed in Heyde and Leonenko [30\u2104, where the\nmain fo us is on stationary ones. The pro esses (9) are also di\u001berent from the one studied\n19\n\n\fin Borland [11\u2104: the latter too are ontinuous and based on the Student distributions, but\nde\u001cned by the sto hasti di\u001berential equation\nD\u2212 12\n\ndXt = t\n\nr\n\n2Dc0\n\u03bd\u22121\n\ns\n\nXt2\n1 + 2D dW ;\nc0 t\n\napart from the striking di\u001beren e with Eq. (9), in Vellekoop and Nieuwenhuis [51\u2104 it is shown\nthat not all the marginal distribution laws of Xt are of Student type.\nInstead in Eberlein and Keller [26\u2104 the Generalized Hyperboli laws are adopted for\ndes ribing the returns at a \u001cxed time s ale; these laws are then extended to the other time\ns ales using the standard L\u00e9vy pro ess onstru tion: in this ase the distributions at the\nother time s ales are no more of Generalized Hyperboli type.\nThe Baldovin and Stella model is also intrinsi ally simpler than the ones des ribed in\nBarndor\u001b-Nielsen and Shephard [7\u2104, where the volatility has a dynami modeled by OrnsteinUhlenbe k type pro esses,\nd\u03c3t2 = \u2212\u03bb\u03c3t2 dt + dLt\n\ndriven by an arbitrary L\u00e9vy pro ess Lt . In this ase, a ording to the hoi e of Lt , any selfde omposable distribution (like the Generalized Inverse Gaussian, or any of its spe ial ases,\nlike the Inverse Gamma) an arise as the distribution of \u03c3t2 for any t. But this simpli\u001c ation\nomes at a high pri e: while in Barndor\u001b-Nielsen \u03c3 is truly dynami , it is \u001cxed in B-S for\nany single pro ess realization.\nIn addition, the models analyzed in Carr et al. [18\u2104 are of a di\u001berent type, even if there\nare some analogies in the underlying prin iples. In Carr et al. [18\u2104 indeed an anomalous\ns aling is introdu ed by onsidering self-similar pro esses, and in that framework any selfde omposable distribution an employed for modeling returns, but on e again only at a\n\u001cxed time s ale, as in the standard ase of L\u00e9vy pro esses. The main di\u001beren e is that in\nCarr et al. [18\u2104 the returns at di\u001berent times are assumed to be totally independent, but\nnot identi ally distributed: instead Baldovin and Stella assume that the returns are only\nlinearly independent, but now with identi al distributions at all the time s ales, up to a\nsimple res aling.\nIn on lusion, despite its urrent inability to reprodu e all the needed stylized fa ts, the\nnew framework proposed by Baldovin and Stella introdu es a new me hanism for modeling\nreturns, based on a few reasonable \u001crst prin iples. We therefore think that, on e suitably\n20\n\n\fmodi\u001ced for instan e along the lines proposed above, the B-S framework an provide a new\ntool for building models of \u001cnan ial pri e dynami s from reasonable assumptions.\nAppendix: Some Useful Fa ts About Student and Symmetri\nboli\n\nGeneralized Hyper-\n\nDistributions\n\nChara teristi\n\nfun tion of Student distributions\n\nThe standard form of univariate Student distribution is\n\u0393( \u03bd2 + 21 )\n1\n,\ng1 (x) = 1/2 \u03bd\n\u03c0 \u0393( 2 ) (1 + x2 ) \u03bd2 + 12\n\nwhile the multivariate one is\n\u0393( \u03bd2 + n2 )\n1\ngn (x) = n/2 \u03bd\nn\n\u03bd\n\u03c0 \u0393( 2 ) (1 + r 2 ) 2 + 2\n\nwith r =\n\npPn\n\ni=1\n\nx2i and P(r > R) \u221d 1/Rv .\n\nUsing some standard relationships involving Bessel fun tions one an ompute analytially the orresponding hara teristi fun tion:\n\u0002\n\n+\u221e\n\ndx1 eik1 x1 g1 (x1 )\n\ng\u03031 (k1 ) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\u0393( \u03bd2 + 12 ) \u03bd\n= 1/2 \u03bd k\n\u03c0 \u0393( 2 )\n\n\u0002\n\n\u03bd\n\n+\u221e\n2\n\n2 \u2212 \u03bd2 \u2212 12\n\ndx (k + x )\n0\n\n21\u2212 2 \u03bd\ncos(x) = \u03bd k 2 K \u03bd2 (k),\n\u0393( 2 )\n\nwith k = |k1 |, K\u03b1 the modi\u001ced Bessel fun tion of third kind, and the employ of identity\n\n7.12.(27) of Erd\u00e9lyi [28\u2104\n\n1\n(2z)\u03bd\nK\u03bd (z) = 1/2 \u0393(\u03bd + )\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0002\n\n\u221e\n\ndt (t2 + z 2 )\u2212\u03bd\u22121/2 cos(t)\n0\n\n\u03c0\n1\nR(\u03bd) > \u2212 , | arg(z) |< .\n2\n2\n\nFor an alternative derivation we refer to Hurst [31\u2104 and to the dis ussion in Heyde and\nLeonenko [30\u2104.
