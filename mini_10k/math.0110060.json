This extends classical topics in\npermutation group theory, and has arithmetic consequences. By a\ntheorem of C. L. Siegel, affine algebraic curves with infinitely many\nintegral points are parametrized by rational functions whose monodromy groups have this property. We classify the possibilities of\nthese monodromy groups, and give an application to Hilbert's irreducibility theorem.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aim of this paper is twofold: First, it provides the group theoretic and\narithmetic classification results to obtain sharpenings of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, like the following:\nTheorem 1.1. Let f (t, X) \u2208 Q(t)[X] be an irreducible polynomial with Galois group G, where G is a simple group not isomorphic to an alternating\ngroup or C2 . Then Gal(f (t\u0304, X)/Q) = G for all but finitely many specializations t\u0304 \u2208 Z.\nMore results of this kind are given in Section 6.\nThe second purpose is to obtain a group theoretic classification result,\nnamely to determine those primitive permutation groups which contain a\ncyclic subgroup with only two orbits. This classification completes and generalizes previous results about permutation groups. The list of possibilities\nis quite long and involved, we give it in Section 3.2.\n1\n\n\fIn the following we explain how these seemingly unrelated topics are\nconnected.\nLet k be a field of characteristic 0, and f (X) \u2208 k[X] be a functionally\nindecomposable polynomial. Let t be a transcendental over k, and A the\nGalois group of f (X) \u2212 t over k(t), considered as a permutation group in\nthe action on the roots of f (X) \u2212 t. It is easy to see that this group action\nis primitive. Furthermore, A contains a transitive cyclic subgroup I, the\ninertia group of a place of the splitting field of f (X) \u2212 t over the place\nt 7\u2192 \u221e. By classical theorems of Schur and Burnside, it is known that a\nprimitive permutation group A with a transitive cyclic subgroup is either\ndoubly transitive, or a subgroup of the affine group AGL1 (p) for a prime p.\nUsing the classification of the doubly transitive groups, which rests on the\nknowledge of the finite simple groups, these groups have been determined,\nsee [11, Theorem 4.1]. Furthermore, if k is algebraically closed, then one\ncan determine the subset of these groups which indeed are Galois groups as\nabove, see [39], which completes (and corrects) [10]. Besides the alternating,\nsymmetric, cyclic and dihedral groups only finitely many cases arise. For\narithmetic applications of these results see [13], [41], [43].\nA more general situation arises if one considers Hilbert's irreducibility\ntheorem over a number field k. Let Ok be the integers of k, and f (t, X) \u2208\nk(t)[X] an irreducible polynomial. Then f (t\u0304, X) is irreducible over k for\ninfinitely many integral specializations t\u0304 \u2208 Ok . Using Siegel's deep theorem\nabout algebraic curves with infinitely many integral points, one can, to some\nextent, describe the set Redf (Ok ) of those specializations t\u0304 \u2208 Ok such that\nf (t\u0304, X) is defined and reducible. There are finitely many rational functions\ngi (Z) \u2208 k(Z), such that |gi (k) \u2229 Ok | = \u221e and Redf (Ok ) differs by finitely\nmany elements from the union of the sets gi (k) \u2229 Ok . Thus, in order to get\nrefined versions of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, one has to get information\nabout rational functions g(Z) which assume infinitely many integral values\non k, see [42]. We call such a function a Siegel function. A theorem of Siegel\nshows that a Siegel function has at most two poles on the Riemann sphere\nP1 (C). Suppose that g(Z) is functionally indecomposable, and let A be the\nGalois group of the numerator of g(Z) \u2212 t over k(t). It follows that A is\nprimitive on the roots of g(Z) \u2212 t, and the information about the poles of\ng(Z) yields a cyclic subgroup I of A such that I has at most two orbits.\nThis generalizes the situation coming from the polynomials, where I has\njust one orbit. In the two-orbit situation not much was known. There is a\nresult by Wielandt [54] (see also [55, V.31]), if the degree of A is 2p for a prime\np, and both orbits of I have length p. Then A is either doubly transitive,\nor 2p \u2212 1 is a square, and a point stabilizer of A has three orbits of known\nlengths. Another case which has been dealt with is that I has two orbits of\n2\n\n\frelatively prime lengths i < j. If i > 1, then a classical result by Marggraf\n[55, Theorem 13.5] immediately shows that A contains the alternating group\nin natural action. The more difficult case i = 1 was treated in [40]. In Section\n3 we classify the primitive groups with a cyclic two-orbit subgroup without\nany condition on the orbit lengths.\nAs in the polynomial case, we again want to know which of these groups\nindeed are Galois groups of g(Z) \u2212 t over k(t), with g(Z) a Siegel function\nas above. This amounts to finding genus 0 systems (to be defined later) in\nnormal subgroups of A, see Section 4.1.\nFinally, for applications to Hilbert's irreducibility theorem over the rationals, we classify the Galois groups of g(Z) \u2212 t over Q(t) of those rational\nfunctions g(Z) \u2208 Q(Z) with |g(Q) \u2229 Z| = \u221e. Section 5 is devoted to that.\nIn contrast to the other mostly group theoretic sections, we need several\narithmetical and computational considerations related to the regular inverse\nGalois problem over Q(t).\n\nContents\n1 Introduction\n\n1\n\n2 Permutation Groups \u2013 Notations, Definitions, and Elementary Results\n4\n2.1 The Aschbacher\u2013O'Nan\u2013Scott Theorem . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n3 Elements with two cycles\n3.1 Previous Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.2 Classification Result . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.3 Affine Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.3.1 Proof of Part 1 of Theorem 3.3 . .\n3.4 Product Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.4.1 Proof of Part 2 of Theorem 3.3 . .\n3.5 Regular Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.6 Diagonal Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.7 Almost Simple Action . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.8 Alternating Groups . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.9 Sporadic Groups . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.10 Classical Groups . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.10.1 Element Orders in Classical Groups\n3.10.2 S Symplectic . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.10.3 S Orthogonal in Odd Dimension . .\n3\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n7\n7\n8\n10\n15\n16\n18\n18\n19\n21\n21\n25\n27\n27\n36\n38\n\n\f3.10.4 S Orthogonal of Plus Type . . . . . . . . . .\n3.10.5 S Orthogonal of Minus Type . . . . . . . . .\n3.10.6 S Unitary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.10.7 Projective Special Linear Groups . . . . . .\n3.11 Exceptional Groups of Lie Type . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.12 Proof of Part 3 of Theorem 3.3 . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.13 Tables on Minimal Permutation Degrees, Maximal\nOrders, etc. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n. . . . .\n. . . . .\n. . . . .\n. . . . .\n. . . . .\n. . . . .\nElement\n. . . . .\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n38\n39\n40\n43\n48\n50\n\n. 52\n\n4 Genus 0 Systems\n4.1 Branch Cycle Descriptions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.1.1 Algebraic Setting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.1.2 Topological Setting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.2 Branch Cycle Descriptions in Permutation Groups . . . . . . .\n4.3 A Lemma about Genus 0 Systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.4 The Siegel-Lang Theorem and Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem\n4.5 Siegel Functions and Ramification at Infinity . . . . . . . . . .\n4.6 Monodromy Groups and Ramification of Siegel Functions . . .\n4.7 Proof of Theorem 4.8 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.7.1 Affine Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.7.2 Product Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.7.3 Almost Simple Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n55\n55\n55\n55\n56\n57\n59\n60\n61\n63\n64\n64\n66\n\n5 Siegel Functions over the Rationals\n5.1 Monodromy Groups and Ramification\n5.2 Proof of Theorem 5.2 . . . . . . . . .\n5.3 Computations . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5.3.1 n = 8, G = AGL3 (2). . . . . .\n5.3.2 n = 16, G = (S4 \u00d7 S4 ) \u22ca C2 .\n5.3.3 n = 16, G = C24 \u22ca S5 . . . . .\n5.3.4 n = 12, G = M12 . . . . . . .\n\n73\n73\n75\n79\n79\n80\n82\n83\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n6 Applications to Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem\n\n2\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n84\n\nPermutation Groups \u2013 Notations, Definitions, and Elementary Results\n\nHere we collect definitions and easy results about finite groups and finite\npermutation groups, which are used throughout the work.\n\n4\n\n\fGeneral notation: For a, b elements of a group G set ab := b\u22121 ab. Furthermore, if A and B are subsets of G, then Ab , aB and AB have their\nobvious meaning. If H is a subgroup of G, then for a subset S of\nG let CH (S) denote the centralizer of S in H and NH (S) denote the\nnormalizer {h \u2208 H| S h = S} of S in H.\nIf A, B, . . . is a collection of subsets or elements of G, then we denote\nby <A, B, . . .> the group generated by these sets and elements.\n\nThe order of an element g \u2208 G is denoted by ord(g).\nPermutation groups: Let G be a permutation group on a finite set \u03a9.\nThen |\u03a9| is the degree of G. We use the exponential notation \u03c9 g to\ndenote the image of \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 under g \u2208 G. The stabilizer of \u03c9 in G is\ndenoted by G\u03c9 . If G is transitive and G\u03c9 is the identity subgroup, then\nG is called regular.\nThe number of fixed points of g on \u03a9 will be denoted by \u03c7(g).\nLet G be transitive on \u03a9 of degree \u2265 2, and let G\u03c9 be the stabilizer\nof \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. Then the number of orbits of G\u03c9 on \u03a9 is the rank of G.\nIn particular, the rank is always \u2265 2, and exactly 2 if and only if the\ngroup is doubly transitive. The subdegrees of G are defined as the orbit\nlengths of G\u03c9 on \u03a9.\nLet G be transitive on \u03a9, and let \u2206 be a nontrivial subset of \u03a9. Set\nS := {\u2206g | g \u2208 G}. We say that \u2206 is a block of G if S is a partition\nof \u03a9. If this is the case, then S is called a block system of G. A block\n(or block system) is called trivial if |\u2206| = 1 or \u2206 = \u03a9. If each block\nsystem of G is trivial, then G is called primitive. Primitivity of G is\nequivalent to maximality of G\u03c9 in G. Note that the orbits of a normal\nsubgroup N of G constitute a block system, thus a normal subgroup of\na primitive permutation group is either trivial or transitive.\nSpecific groups: We denote by Cn and Dn the cyclic and dihedral group of\norder n and 2n, respectively. If not otherwise said, then Cn and Dn are\nregarded as permutation groups in their natural degree n action. The\nalternating and symmetric group on n letters is denoted by An and S n ,\nrespectively.\nWe write S(M) for the symmetric group on a set M.\n\nLet m \u2265 1 be an integer, and q be a power of the prime p. Let Fq\nbe the field with q elements. We denote by GLm (q) (or sometimes\nGLm (Fq )) the general linear group of Fm\nq , and by SLm (q) the special\nlinear group. Regard these groups as acting on Fm\nq . The group \u0393 :=\n5\n\n\fGal(Fq /Fp ) acts componentwise on Fm\nq . This action of \u0393 normalizes\nthe actions of GLm (q) and SLm (q). We use the following symbols for\nthe corresponding semidirect products: \u0393Lm (q) := <GLm (q), \u0393> =\nGLm (q) \u22ca \u0393, \u03a3Lm (q) := <SLm (q), \u0393> = SLm (q) \u22ca \u0393.\nNote that if q = pe , then we have the natural inclusion \u0393Lm (q) \u2264\nGLme (p).\nLet G be a subgroup of \u0393Lm (q), and denote by N the action of Fm\nq on itself by translation. Then G normalizes the action of N. If G = GLm (q),\nSLm (q), \u0393Lm (q), or \u03a3Lm (q), then denote the semidirect product of G\nwith N by AGLm (q), ASLm (q), A\u0393Lm (q), or A\u03a3Lm (q), respectively. A\ngroup A with N \u2264 A \u2264 A\u0393Lm (q) is called an affine permutation group.\n1\nLet G \u2264 \u0393Lm (q) act naturally on V := Fm\nq . We denote by P (V ) the\nset of one\u2013dimensional subspaces of V . As G permutes the elements in\nP1 (V ), we get an (in general not faithful) action of G on P1 (V ). The\ninduced faithful permutation group on P1 (V ) is named by prefixing a\nP in front of the group name, so we get the groups PGLm (q), PSLm (q),\nP\u0393Lm (q), or P\u03a3Lm (q), respectively.\n\nThe group GLm (q) contains, up to conjugacy, a unique cyclic subgroup\nwhich permutes regularly the non\u2013zero vectors of Fm\nq . This group,\nand also its homomorphic image in PGLm (q), is usually called Singer\ngroup. Existence of this group follows from the regular representation\nof the multiplicative group of Fqm on Fqm \u223c\n= Fm\nq , uniqueness follows for\nexample from Schur's Lemma and the Skolem\u2013Noether Theorem (or\nby the Lang's Theorem).\nFor n \u2208 {11, 12, 22, 23, 24} we denote by Mn the five Mathieu groups\nof degree n, and let M10 be a point stabilizer of M11 in the transitive\naction on 10 points.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Aschbacher\u2013O'Nan\u2013Scott Theorem\n\nThe Aschbacher\u2013O'Nan\u2013Scott Theorem makes a rough distinction between\nseveral possible types of actions of a primitive permutation group. This\ntheorem had first been announced by O'Nan and Scott on the Santa Cruz\nConference on Finite groups in 1979, see [47]. In their statement a case was\nmissing, and the same omission appears in [3]. To our knowledge, the first\ncomplete version is in [1]. A very concise and readable proof is given in [33],\nsee also [9].\nLet A be a primitive permutation group of degree n on \u03a9. Then one of\nthe following actions occurs:\n6\n\n\fm\nAffine action. We can identify \u03a9 with a vector space Fm\np , and Fp \u2264 A \u2264\nAGLm (p) is an affine group as described above.\n\nRegular normal subgroup action. A has a non\u2013abelian normal subgroup\nwhich acts regularly on \u03a9. (There are finer distinctions in this case,\nsee [33], but we don't need that extra information.)\nDiagonal action. A has a unique minimal normal subgroup of the form\nN = S1 \u00d7S2 \u00d7* * *\u00d7St , where the Si are pairwise isomorphic non\u2013abelian\nsimple groups, and the point stabilizer N\u03c9 is a diagonal subgroup of N.\nProduct action. We can write \u03a9 = \u2206 \u00d7 \u2206 * * * \u00d7 \u2206 with t \u2265 2 factors, and\nA is a subgroup of the wreath product S(\u2206) \u2240 S t = S(\u2206)t \u22ca S t in the\nnatural product action on this cartesian product. In such a case, we\nwill say that A preserves a product structure.\nAlmost simple action. There is S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S) for a simple non\u2013abelian\ngroup S. In this case, S cannot act regularly.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nElements with two cycles\nPrevious Results\n\nOur goal is the classification of those primitive permutation groups A of\ndegree n which contain an element \u03c3 with at most two cycles. If \u03c3 actually\nis an n\u2013cycle, the result is a well\u2013known consequence of the classification of\ndoubly transitive permutation groups.\nTheorem 3.1 (Feit [11, 4.1]). Let A be a primitive permutation group of\ndegree n which contains an n\u2013cycle. Then one of the following holds.\n(a) A \u2264 AGL1 (p), n = p a prime; or\n(b) A = An or S n ; or\n(c) PSLk (q) \u2264 A \u2264 P\u0393Lk (q), k \u2265 2, q a prime power, A acting naturally\non the projective space with n = (q k \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1) points; or\n(d) n = 11, A = PSL2 (11) or M11 ; or\n(e) n = 23, A = M23 .\n\n7\n\n\fIf \u03c3 has two cycles of coprime length, say k and l = n\u2212k with k \u2264 l, then\nit follows immediately from Marggraf's theorem [55, Theorem 13.5], applied\nto the subgroup generated by \u03c3 l , that An \u2264 A unless k = 1. The critical\ncase thus is k = 1. We quote the classification result [40, 6.2].\nTheorem 3.2. Let A be a primitive permutation group of degree n which\ncontains an element with exactly two cycles, of coprime lengths k \u2264 l. Assume that An 6\u2264 A. Then k = 1, and one of the following holds.\n(a) n = q m for a prime power q, AGLm (q) \u2264 A \u2264 A\u0393Lm (q); or\n(b) n = p + 1, PSL2 (p) \u2264 A \u2264 PGL2 (p), p \u2265 5 a prime; or\n(c) n = 12, A = M11 or M12 ; or\n(d) n = 24, A = M24 .\nIn the remainder of this chapter, we deal with the case where k and l\nare not necessarily coprime. The assumptions in the Theorems 3.1 and 3.2\nquickly give that A is doubly transitive (or A \u2264 AGL1 (p), a trivial case) -\nthis is clear under existence of an (n\u22121)\u2013cycle, and follows from Theorems of\nSchur [55, 25.3] and Burnside [21, XII.10.8] under the presence of an n\u2013cycle.\nSo one basically has to check the list of doubly transitive groups.\nIn the general case however, A no longer need to be doubly transitive.\nExcluding the case A \u2264 AGL1 (p), we will obtain as a corollary of our classification that A has permutation rank \u2264 3, though I do not see how to obtain\nthat directly. I know only two results in the literature where this has been\nshown under certain restrictions. The first one is by Wielandt [55, Theorem\n31.2], [54], under the assumption that k = l, and k is a prime, and the other\none is by Scott, see the announcement of the never published proof in [48].\nIn Scott's announcement, however, there are several specific assumptions on\nA. First k = l, and A has to have a doubly transitive action of degree k, such\nthat the point\u2013stabilizer in this action is intransitive in the original action,\nbut that the element with the two cycles of length k in the original action is\na k\u2013cycle in the degree k action.\n\n3.2\n\nClassification Result\n\nRecall that if t is a divisor of m, then we have \u0393Lm/t (pt ) naturally embedded\nin GLm (p). We use this remark in the main result of this chapter.\nTheorem 3.3. Let A be a primitive permutation group of degree n which\ncontains an element with exactly two cycles of lengths k and n \u2212 k \u2265 k.\nThen one of the following holds, where A1 denotes the stabilizer of a point.\n8\n\n\f1. (Affine action) A \u2264 AGLm (p) is an affine permutation group, where\nn = pm and p is a prime number. Furthermore, one of the following\nholds.\n(a) n = pm , k = 1, and GLm/t (pt ) \u2264 A1 \u2264 \u0393Lm/t (pt ) for a divisor t\nof m;\n(b) n = pm , k = p, and A1 = GLm (p);\n(c) n = p2 , k = p, and A1 < GL2 (p) is the group of monomial matrices (here p > 2);\n(d) n = 2m , k = 4, and A1 = GLm (2);\n(e) (Sporadic affine cases)\nn = 4, k = 2, and A1 = GL1 (4) (so A = A4 );\nn = 8, k = 2, and A1 = \u0393L1 (8);\nn = 9, k = 3, and A1 = \u0393L1 (9);\nn = 16, k = 8, and [\u0393L1 (16) : A1 ] = 3 or A1 \u2208 {\u0393L1 (16), (C3 \u00d7\nC3 ) \u22ca C4 , \u03a3L2 (4), \u0393L2 (4), A6 , GL4 (2)};\nv. n = 16, k = 4 or 8, and A1 \u2208 {(S 3 \u00d7 S 3 ) \u22ca C2 , S 5 , S 6 };\nvi. n = 16, k = 2 or 8, and A1 = A7 < GL4 (2);\nvii. n = 25, k = 5, and [GL2 (5) : A1 ] = 5;\ni.\nii.\niii.\niv.\n\n2. (Product action) One of the following holds.\n(a) n = r 2 with 1 < r \u2208 N, k = ra with gcd(r, a) = 1, A = (S r \u00d7 S r )\u22ca\nC2 , and A1 = (S r\u22121 \u00d7 S r\u22121 ) \u22ca C2 ;\n\n(b) n = (p + 1)2 with p \u2265 5 prime, k = p + 1, A = (PGL2 (p) \u00d7\nPGL2 (p)) \u22ca C2 , and A1 = (AGL1 (p) \u00d7 AGL1 (p)) \u22ca C2 .\n\n3. (Almost simple action) S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S) for a simple, non\u2013abelian\ngroup S, and one of the following holds.\n(a) n \u2265 5, An \u2264 A \u2264 S n in natural action;\n\n(b) n = 10, k = 5, and A5 \u2264 A \u2264 S 5 in the action on the 2\u2013sets of\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n(c) n = p + 1, k = 1, and PSL2 (p) \u2264 A \u2264 PGL2 (p) for a prime p;\n\n(d) n = (q m \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1), k = n/2, and PSLm (q) \u2264 A \u2264 P\u0393Lm (q) for\nan odd prime power q and m \u2265 2 even;\n(e) n = 19, k = 2, and M10 \u2264 A \u2264 P\u0393L2 (9);\n\n(f ) n = 21, k = 7, and P\u03a3L3 (4) \u2264 A \u2264 P\u0393L3 (4);\n9\n\n\f(g) n = 12, k = 1 or 4, and A = M11 in its action on 12 points;\n(h) n = 12, k = 1, 2, 4, or 6, and A = M12 ;\n(i) n = 22, k = 11, and M22 \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(M22 ) = M22 \u22ca C2 ;\n(j) n = 24, k = 1, 3, or 12, and A = M24 .\n\nThe proof of this theorem is given in the following sections. We distinguish\nthe various cases of the Aschbacher-O'Nan-Scott theorem, because the cases\nrequire quite different methods. The almost simple groups comprise the most\ncomplex case. We split this case further up into the subcases where the simple\nnormal subgroup S is alternating, sporadic, a classical Lie type group, or an\nexceptional Lie type group.\nWe note an interesting consequence of the previous theorem which generalizes several classical results on permutations groups. It would be very\ninteresting to have a direct proof, without appealing to the classification of\nthe finite simple groups.\nCorollary 3.4. Let A be a primitive permutation group which contains an\nelement with exactly two cycles. Then A has rank at most 3.\n\n3.3\n\nAffine Action\n\nWe need the following well\u2013known\nLemma 3.5. Let K be a field of positive characteristic p, and \u03c3 \u2208 GLm (K)\nof order pb \u2265 p. Then pb\u22121 \u2264 m \u2212 1. In particular, ord(\u03c3) \u2264 p(m \u2212 1) if\nm \u2265 2.\nProof. 1 is the only eigenvalue of \u03c3, therefore \u03c3 is conjugate to an upper\ntriangular matrix with 1's on the diagonal. So \u03c3 \u2212 1 is nilpotent. Now\nb\u22121\nb\u22121\n(\u03c3 \u2212 1)p = \u03c3 p \u2212 1 6= 0, thus pb\u22121 < m, and the claim follows.\nWe note the easy consequence\nLemma 3.6. Let A be an affine permutation group of degree pm . Let A\ncontain an element of order pr for r \u2208 N. Then pr\u22121 \u2264 m. In particular, if\nr = m, then m \u2264 2, and m = 1 for p > 2.\nProof. Without loss A = AGLm (p). We use the well\u2013known embedding of A\nin GLm+1 (p): Let g \u2208 GLm (p), v \u2208 N. Then define the action of gv \u2208 A on\nthe vector space N \u00d7 Fp via (w, wm+1)gv := (wg + wm+1 v, wm+1 ) for w \u2208 N,\nwm+1 \u2208 Fp .\nThis way we obtain an element \u03c3 of order pr in GLm+1 (p). The claim\nfollows from Lemma 3.5.\n10\n\n\fLemma 3.7. Let H be a rank 3 permutation group with subdegrees 1 \u2264 u \u2264\nv. Suppose that H is imprimitive. Then 1 + u divides v.\nProof. Let \u2206 be a nontrivial block, and \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206. Let \u01eb 6= \u03b4 be in \u2206. Then\n\u2206 contains the orbit \u01ebH\u03b4 . Also, \u2206 does not meet a point from an H\u03b4 \u2013orbit\ndifferent from {\u03b4} and \u01ebH\u03b4 , for then \u2206 were the full set H is acting on. Thus\n\u2206 = {\u03b4} \u222a \u01ebH\u03b4 . But\n|\u01ebH\u03b4 | = |\u2206| \u2212 1 \u2264 (1 + u + v)/2 \u2212 1 < v,\nso the orbit \u01ebH\u03b4 has length u, and 1 + u divides v because the orbit of size v\nis a union of conjugates of \u2206.\nWe need to know the doubly transitive permutation subgroups of the\ncollineation group of a projective linear space.\nProposition 3.8 (Cameron, Kantor [4, Theorem I]). Let m \u2265 3, p be\na prime, and H \u2264 GLm (p) be acting doubly transitively on the lines of Fm\np .\nThen SLm (p) \u2264 H or H = A7 < SL4 (2).\nAlso, the primitive rank 3 permutation subgroups of even order of the\ncollineation group of a projective linear space have been classified by Perin\nin an unpublished thesis. We use a result of Cameron and Kantor which\nextends this result. The odd order case, which is not given there, is easily\nhandled by a result of Huppert.\nProposition 3.9. Let m \u2265 3, p be a prime, and H \u2264 GLm (p) be acting\nprimitively of rank 3 on the lines of Fm\np . Then Spm (p) E H, or p = 2,\nm = 3, H = \u0393L1 (8), and the subdegrees are 1, 3, 3.\nProof. If H has even order see the remarks preceding [4, Prop. 8.5]. So assume that H has odd order. Then H is solvable, so also H\u0303 = F\u22c6p H is solvable.\nFurthermore, H\u0303 is transitive on Fm\np . These groups have been classified by\nHuppert [21, XII.7.3]. Either H\u0303 \u2264 \u0393L1 (pm ), or pm = 34 . (The other exceptional cases in Huppert's classification have m = 2.) Let us look at the\naction of \u0393L1 (pm ) = F\u22c6pm \u22ca Aut(Fpm ) on F\u22c6pm /F\u22c6p . The stabilizer of the set\nF\u22c6p is just F\u22c6p \u22ca Aut(Fpm ). So the orbit lengths of the point stabilizer on the\nprojective space are at most m. Therefore we get that the rank is at least\n1+\n\n(pm \u2212 1)/(p \u2212 1) \u2212 1\n> 1 + (pm\u22121 \u2212 1)/m.\nm\n\nThus pm\u22121 \u2212 1 < 2m, hence p = 2 and m = 3 or 4. If m = 4, then H has no\ncontribution coming from Aut(F16 ) by the assumption of odd order, hence\nthe point stabilizer is even trivial. The case m = 3 indeed does occur.\n11\n\n\fNow suppose p = 3, m = 4. The transitive soluble subgroups of GL4 (3)\nare available for instance via GAP [46], and one immediately checks that\nnone of them induces a primitive group on the lines of F43 .\nIn order to handle the case m = p2 , we need the following\nLemma 3.10. Let p be a prime, and let H \u2264 GL2 (p) act irreducibly on\nF2p . Let \u03c9\u0001 be a generator of the multiplicative group of Fp , and suppose that\n\u03c4 := 10 \u03c90 \u2208 H. Then one of the following holds.\n(a) H = GL2 (p).\n\n(b) H is the group of monomial matrices.\n(c) p = 5, and [GL2 (5) : H] = 5.\n(d) p = 3, and H is a Sylow 2\u2013subgroup of GL2 (3).\n(e) p = 2, and H \u223c\n= C3 .\nProof. The cases p = 2 and 3 are straightforward. So assume p \u2265 5. If\nSL2 (p) \u2264 H, then H = GL2 (p) and (a) holds, because the determinant of\n\u03c4 \u2208 H is a generator of F\u22c6p .\nSo we assume in the following that H does not contain SL2 (p). We first\ncontend that p does not divide the order of H. Suppose it does. Then H\ncontains a Sylow p\u2013subgroup P of H. If P is normal in H, then H is conjugate\nto a group of upper triangular matrices, hence not irreducible. Therefore P is\nnot normal in H, thus H contains at least 1 + p Sylow p\u2013subgroups of GL2 (p)\n(by Sylow's Theorem). But GL2 (p) has exactly p + 1 Sylow p\u2013subgroups, so\nH contains all the p + 1 Sylow p\u2013subgroups of GL2 (p). But these Sylow\np\u2013subgroups generate SL2 (p), contrary to our assumption.\nSet C = <\u03c4 >, and let S \u223c\n= F\u22c6p be the group of scalar matrices. So CS is\nthe group of diagonal matrices. First assume that H normalizes CS. Then,\nby irreducibility of H, some element in H must switch the two eigenspaces\nof C. It follows quickly that H is monomial.\nSo finally suppose that CS is not normalized by H. Then there is a\nconjugate (CS)h with h \u2208 H, such that (CS) \u2229 (CS)h = S. So we have\n|HS| \u2265 |(CS)(CS)h | = (p \u22121)3 and (p \u22121)2 ||HS|. First note that we cannot\nhave |HS| = (p \u2212 1)3 simply because (p \u2212 1)3 does not divide |GL2 (p)| =\n(p \u2212 1)2 p(p + 1). So |HS| \u2265 p(p \u2212 1)2 . But again equality cannot hold, for\nwe noted already that p does not divide |H|. So |HS| \u2265 (p + 1)(p \u2212 1)2 ,\nhence [GL2 (p) : HS] \u2264 p. But PGL2 (p) = GL2 (p)/S acts faithfully on the\ncoset space PGL2 (p)/(HS/S) and has an element of order p, hence [GL2 (p) :\n12\n\n\fHS] = p. A classical theorem of Galois [20, II.8.28] says that if PSL2 (p)\nhas a transitive permutation representation of degree p, then p \u2264 11. But\none checks that GL2 (p) does not have a subgroup of index p for p = 7 and\n11, thus p = 5. So |HS| = 96 = 16 * 2 * 3. Therefore CS (of order 16) has\na proper normalizer in HS. By an argument as above, we thus obtain an\nelement h \u2208 H which switches the eigenspaces of C. So <C, C h > \u2264 H is the\ngroup of diagonal matrices, in particular S \u2264 H. The claim follows.\nThe following proposition is based on Hering's [18], [19] classification of\ntransitive linear groups. Note that his results are incomplete, and the first\ncomplete treatment is given by Liebeck in [32, Appendix 1].\nProposition 3.11. Let m \u2265 5, and H \u2264 GLm (2) be irreducible on V :=\nFm\n2 . Suppose there is an element \u03c4 \u2208 H which is the the identity on a 2\u2013\ndimensional subspace U of V , and cyclically permutes the nonzero elements\nof a complement W of U in V . Then either H = GLm (2), or m is even and\nGLm/2 (4) \u2264 H \u2264 \u0393Lm/2 (4).\n\nProof. For a subspace X of V set X \u266f := X \\ {0}. We first want to show that\nH is transitive on V \u266f . The cycles of \u03c4 on V \u266f are {u}, u \u2208 U \u266f , and W \u266f + u,\nu \u2208 U. If C1 and C2 are subsets of V \u266f such that each Ci lies completely in\nan H\u2013orbit, then we say that C1 and C2 are connected if they lie in the same\nH\u2013orbit. The latter is equivalent to the existence of h \u2208 H with C1 \u2229C2h 6= \u2205.\nEach of the cycles from above lies in an H\u2013orbit. Consider the graph with\nvertice set these cycles, and let two vertices be connected if and only if the\ncorresponding cycles are connected. The aim is to show that this graph is\nconnected.\nWe first show that for each u \u2208 U there is u 6= u\u2032 \u2208 U such that W \u266f + u\nand W \u266f + u\u2032 are connected. Suppose that were not the case. Then, for each\nh \u2208 H,\n(W \u266f + u)h \u2286 (W \u266f + u) \u222a U \u266f ,\nso\nW h \u2286 (W + u \u2212 uh ) \u222a (U \u266f \u2212 uh ).\nFirst assume that u 6= 0. Then not each element of U \u266f \u2212 uh can be contained\nin W h , for this would imply the nonsense h\u22121 (U \u266f ) \u2286 W \u266f + u. Thus we get\n|W h \u2229 (W + u \u2212 uh )| \u2265 2m\u22122 \u2212 3.\nLet r be the dimension of W h \u2229 (W + u \u2212 uh ) as an affine space. It follows\nthat 2r \u2265 2m\u22122 \u2212 3, so r = m \u2212 2 as m \u2265 5. Thus W h = W for all h \u2208 H,\ncontrary to irreducibility of H.\n13\n\n\fNow suppose that u = 0. Then by the above\n(W \\ h\u22121 (U))h = (W \u266f \\ h\u22121 (U\u266f))h \u2286 W \u266f + u \u2282 W \u2032 ,\nwhere W \u2032 is the (m \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional space W \u222a (W + u). But the elements\nin W \\ h\u22121 (U))h generate W , so W h \u2282 W \u2032 for all h, again contrary to\nirreducibility of H.\nLet u \u2208 U \u266f be such that W \u266f and W \u266f + u are connected. We show that\nthese two cycles must also be connected to another W \u266f + u\u2032 for u\u2032 \u2208 U \u266f\ndifferent from u. Suppose that this were not the case. Let W \u2032 be the (m\u22121)\u2013\ndimensional space W \u222a (W + u). Then, similar as above, (W \u2032 )h \u2282 W \u2032 \u222a U,\nfor all h \u2208 H. But W \u2032 \\ (W \u2032 \u2229 h\u22121 (U)) generates W \u2032 , so W \u2032 is h\u2013invariant\nfor all h \u2208 H, again contrary to irreducibility of H.\nFrom these two steps we see that all the W \u266f + u for u \u2208 U are connected.\nFinally, let u\u2032 \u2208 U \u266f . Then also {u\u2032 } is connected to some and hence all the\nW \u266f + u, because (u\u2032 )H generates V by irreducibility, so (u\u2032 )H * U \u266f .\nThus H is transitive on V \u266f . So we can use the Hering\u2013Liebeck list [32,\nAppendix 1] of such groups. Let L \u2286 End(V ) be a maximal field which is\nnormalized by H. (L is unique, see [18, Lemma 5.2].) So |L| = 2s where s\ndivides m, and H \u2264 \u0393Lm/s (2s ). We get that SLm/s (2s ) \u2264 H \u2264 \u0393Lm/s (2s ), or\nH \u2264 Spm (2) with m even. (The Hering\u2013Liebeck result is more precise, but\nthis rough version is good enough here.) We claim that s = 1 or 2 in the first\ncase. As m \u2265 5, we have s \u2264 m < 2m\u22122 \u2212 1 = ord(\u03c4 ), hence \u03c4 s has exactly\n4 fixed points on V and \u03c4 s \u2208 GLm/s (2s ). Thus 2s \u2264 4. If s = 2, then note\nthat the determinant of \u03c4 as an L\u2013endomorphism of V is a generator of L\u22c6 ,\nhence GLm/2 (4) \u2264 H in this case.\nFinally, we need to show that H \u2264 Spm (2) cannot happen. Let (*, *)\nbe the associated symplectic form on V . If v \u2208 V is non\u2013zero, then the\nstabilizer of v in Spm (2) has two orbits on V \u266f \\ {v} \u2013 the orbit of length\n2m\u22121 \u2212 2 through those v \u2032 with (v, v \u2032) = 0, and the orbit of length 2m\u22121\nthrough those v \u2032 with (v, v \u2032) = 1, see [20, II.9.15]. Thus for u \u2208 U \u266f , either\n(u, W \u266f ) = 0 or (u, W \u266f ) = 1. We aim to show that the restriction of the\nsymplectic form to W is not degenerate. This is clear if (U, W ) = 0. So\nsuppose there is u \u2208 U with (u, W \u266f) = 1. The orthogonal complement W \u22a5\nintersects U non-trivially (for if u1 and u2 are different elements in U with\n(ui , W ) = 1, then (u1 + u2 , W ) = 0). So the radical of W has dimension \u2264 1,\nhence in fact is trivial, because W has even dimension.\nTherefore W is a non-degenerate symplectic space, where \u03c4 acts irreducibly on. So ord(\u03c4 ) divides 2(m\u22122)/2 + 1 = 2dim W/2 + 1, see Lemma 3.29,\ncontrary to ord(\u03c4 ) = 2m\u22122 \u2212 1.\nThe proof of the following lemma is straightforward.\n14\n\n\fLemma 3.12. Let m \u2265 2, p a prime, and Fm\np = U \u2295 W with U and W\ninvariant under \u03c4 \u2208 GLm (p). Assume that \u03c4 acts as a Singer cycle on W .\n(a) Let dim U = 1, and suppose that \u03c4 act as the identity on U. Choose\nu \u2208 U \u266f . Then (\u03c4, u) \u2208 AGLm (p) acts as an element with cycle lengths\np and pm \u2212 p on Fm\np .\n(b) Let dim U = 2, p = 2, and suppose that \u03c4 act as an involution on U.\nChoose u \u2208 U with u 6= u\u03c4 . Then (\u03c4, u) \u2208 AGLm (2) acts as an element\nwith cycle lengths 4 and 2m \u2212 4 on Fm\n2 .\n3.3.1\n\nProof of Part 1 of Theorem 3.3\n\nWe may assume that A \u2264 AGLm (p), acting on N = Fm\np . Let \u03c3 be the\nelement with the cycle lengths k and l. First note that k divides l, for\notherwise \u03c3 l would fix l > pm /2 points, which of course is nonsense. So\nk = pr , l = pr (pm\u2212r \u2212 1) for some r \u2208 N0 .\nFirst suppose k < l. Then \u03c3 k fixes exactly k = pr points on N. Without\nloss \u03c3 k \u2208 GLm (p), so the fixed point set of \u03c3 k is a subspace N1 of N. But\nthe elements of N1 constitute the k\u2013cycle of \u03c3, so \u03c3 acts as an affine map\nof order pr on the r\u2013dimensional space N1 . Apply Lemma 3.6 to see that\nr \u2208 {0, 1, 2}, and r \u2264 1 if p > 2.\nIf k = l, then of course p = 2 and k = l = ord(\u03c3) = 2m\u22121 . Lemma 3.6\ngives 2m\u22122 \u2264 m, hence r = m \u2212 1 \u2264 3.\nWe need to determine the possible groups A. If k = 1 we use a result\nof Kantor [22] which classifies linear groups over a finite field containing an\nelement which cyclically permutes the non-zero elements. Note that \u03c3 is just\nsuch an element.\nNow suppose k = p. The element \u03c4 := \u03c3 p \u2208 GLm (p) fixes a line U \u223c\n= Fp\npointwise. As gcd(ord(\u03c4 ), p) = 1, Maschke's Theorem gives a complement W\nof U which is \u03c4 \u2013invariant. As \u03c4 has cycles of length ord(\u03c4 ) = pm\u22121 \u22121 = |W \u266f |\non W \u266f , we see that \u03c4 permutes the elements of W \u266f cyclically. Look at the\naction which A1 and \u03c4 induce on the projective space P (Fm\np ). The element \u03c4\nhas a fixed point (corresponding to U), a cycle of length (pm\u22121 \u2212 1)/(p \u2212 1)\n(corresponding to W ) and a cycle of length pm\u22121 \u22121 (corresponding to u + W\nfor 0 6= u \u2208 U).\nLemma 3.10 handles the case m = 2. So for the rest of this argument we\nassume m \u2265 3. We contend that A1 is transitive on P (Fm\np ). By primitivity,\nm\nA1 is irreducible on Fp , so it moves the fixed point of \u03c4 as well as the cycle\nof length (pm\u22121 \u2212 1)/(p \u2212 1). So if A1 were not transitive, then A1 would\nleave U \u222a W invariant. Let a \u2208 A1 with W a 6= W , and choose w \u2208 W with\n15\n\n\fw a \u2208 U. Then W \\ Fp w is invariant under a. But W \\ Fp w generates W\nbecause of m \u2265 3, a contradiction.\nLooking at \u03c4 we see that A1 is a transitive group on P (Fm\np ) of rank at\nmost 3. If A1 is even doubly transitive, then by Proposition 3.8 either p = 2,\nm = 4, and A1 = A7 , or SLm (p) \u2264 A1 . It is easy to see that the determinant\nof \u03c4 is a generator of the multiplicative group of Fp . Thus A1 = GLm (p) in\nthe latter case.\nNext assume that A1 has rank 3 on P (Fm\np ). We first use Lemma 3.7 to\nsee that A1 is also primitive. For if not, then 1 + \u03b1 divides (p \u2212 1)\u03b1 with\n\u03b1 = (pm\u22121 \u2212 1)/(p \u2212 1), so 1 + \u03b1 divides p \u2212 1, which of course is nonsense.\nSo we can apply Proposition 3.9. Suppose that Spm (p) E A1 . However,\nm\u22121\nSpm (p) has rank 3 on P (Fm\nand p(pm\u22122 \u2212 1)/(p \u2212 1)\np ) and subdegrees 1, p\n(see [20, II.9.15]), which is not compatible with the cycle lengths of \u03c4 we\ndetermined above. Thus the other possibility of the proposition holds, that\nis p = 2, m = 3, A1 = \u0393L1 (8), which indeed gives case 1(e)ii in the theorem.\nTo see that the groups listed in 1b and 1c indeed have an element with\ncycle lengths p and pm \u2212p use Lemma 3.12, and similarly for the cycle lengths\n4 and 2m \u2212 4 in 1d.\nNext we look at the case p = 2 and k = 4. The case m \u2264 4 is done by\ninspection, so assume m \u2265 5. Set \u03c4 := \u03c3 4 . As above we see that Fm\n2 = U \u2295W\nwith dim U = 2, \u03c4 is trivial on U, and acts as a Singer cycle on W . In view\nof Proposition 3.11 we need to show that GLm/2 (4) \u2264 A1 \u2264 \u0393Lm/2 (4) is not\npossible. Suppose that were the case. Write \u03c3 = (\u03b2, v) with \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393Lm/2 (4),\nm/2\nand v \u2208 F4 . First note that U \u03b2 +v = U, so v \u2208 U and \u03b2 leaves U invariant.\n2\nThis easily implies \u03b2 4 = \u03c4 . The intersection W \u2229 W \u03b2 is not trivial (by\ndimension reasons) and invariant under \u03b2 2 , so in particular invariant under\n2\n\u03c4 . Hence W = W \u03b2 by irreducibility of \u03c4 on W . But W \u2229 W \u03b2 is also\n\u03c4 \u2013invariant, so \u03b2 leaves W invariant by the same argument. As \u03c4 = \u03b2 4\npermutes the elements of W \u266f cyclically, the same holds true for \u03b2. Hence \u03b2\nhas odd order 2m\u22122 \u2212 1 when restricted to W . In particular, \u03b2 \u2208 GLm/2 (4).\nOn the other hand, as (\u03b2, v) has order 4 on U, the order of \u03b2 on U must be a\ndivisor of 4. However, |GL1 (4)| = 3, hence \u03b2 is trivial on U. But then (\u03b2, v)\nhas order 2 on U, a contradiction.\nThe case k = l = 8, p = 2, is most conveniently done by inspection using\nGAP [46].\n\n3.4\n\nProduct Action\n\nSet \u2206 = {1, 2, . . . , r} for r \u2265 2, and let m \u2265 2 be an integer. Then the\nwreath product S r \u2240 S m = (S r \u00d7 S r \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S r ) \u22ca S m acts in a natural way\n16\n\n\fon \u03a9 := \u2206 \u00d7 \u2206 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u2206. We say that a permutation group A acts via\nthe product action, if it is permutation equivalent to a transitive subgroup of\nS r \u2240 S m in this action.\nIn order to avoid an overlap with the affine permutation groups, we\nquickly note the easy\nLemma 3.13. Let A be a primitive subgroup of S r \u2240 S m where r \u2264 4. Then\nA is affine.\nProof. Let N be the minimal normal subgroup of S r \u2240 S m . Then N is elementary abelian of order r m . If A intersects N non-trivially, then N \u2229 A is\na minimal normal subgroup of A, and the claim follows. So suppose that\n|A \u2229 N| = 1. Then A embeds into (S r \u2240 S m )/N. But r m divides |A| by transitivity, so r m divides (r!)m m!/r m . We get that 2m divides m! if r = 2 or 4,\nm\nand\nm! if r = 3. But if p is a prime, then the exponent of p in m!\n\u0002m\u0003 P\nP3 divides\nm\nis \u03bd\u22650 p\u03bd < \u03bd\u22650 pm\u03bd = p\u22121\n\u2264 m, a contradiction.\nRemark. One might expect that any primitive subgroup of an affine group\nis affine. However, that is not the case. There seem to be very few counterexamples. The smallest is as follows: Set A = AGL3 (2) = C23 \u22ca A1 . Then it\nis known (see e.g. [20, page 161]) that H 1 (GL3 (2), C23) = C2 . So there is a\ncomplement U of C23 in A which is not conjugate to A1 . One checks that U\nacts primitively on the 8 points via U \u223c\n= GL3 (2) \u223c\n= PSL2 (7).\nThe following two lemmas are trivial but useful.\nLemma 3.14. Let \u22061 , \u22062 , . . . , \u2206m be finite sets, and gi be in the symmetric\ngroup of \u2206i . Let oi be the cycle length of gi through \u03b4i \u2208 \u2206i . Then the cycle\nlength of (g1 , g2 , . . . , gm ) through (\u03b41 , \u03b42 , . . . , \u03b4m ) \u2208 \u22061 \u00d7 \u22062 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u2206m is\n<gm >\nlcm(o1 , o2 , . . . , om ). In particular, \u03b41<g1 > \u00d7 \u03b42<g2 > \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u03b4m\nis the orbit of\n<(g1 , g2 , . . . , gm )> through (\u03b41 , \u03b42 , . . . , \u03b4m ) if and only if the oi are relatively\nprime.\nLemma 3.15. Let \u22061 , \u22062 , . . . , \u2206m be finite sets, and gi be in the symmetric\ngroup of \u2206i . Let ci be the number of cycles of gi on \u2206i . Then (g1 , g2 , . . . , gm )\nhas at least c1 c2 * * * cm cycles on \u22061 \u00d7 \u22062 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u2206m .\nLemma 3.16. Suppose r \u2265 5 and m \u2265 2. Let g = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3m )\u03c4 be an\nelement of S r \u2240 S m , with \u03c3i \u2208 S r and \u03c4 \u2208 S m an m\u2013cycle. Then g has at\nleast 3 cycles in the product action.\n\n17\n\n\fProof. Set g := g m = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3m ) \u2208 S m\nr . Then\n\u03c3i = \u03c3i \u03c3i+1 * * * \u03c3m \u03c31 * * * \u03c3i\u22121 ,\nso in particular the \u03c3i are pairwise conjugate in S r . Suppose that g has at\nmost 2 cycles. Then g has at most 2m cycles.\nLet \u03bb be the number of cycles of \u03c31 . Then g has at least \u03bbm cycles by\nLemma 3.15, hence \u03bbm \u2264 2m. This gives \u03bb = 1 unless m = 2 and \u03bb = 2. If\n\u03bb = 1, then g has r m\u22121 cycles by Lemma 3.14, so r m\u22121 \u2264 2m, hence r \u2264 4,\na contradiction. So suppose that m = 2 and \u03c31 has two cycles. Then g has\nobviously at least 6 > 2m cycles, a contradiction.\n3.4.1\n\nProof of Part 2 of Theorem 3.3\n\nWe assume that A \u2264 S r \u2240 S m with r \u2265 5 (by Lemma 3.13) and m \u2265 2. Let\ng = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3m )\u03c4 with \u03c3i \u2208 S r , \u03c4 \u2208 S m .\nAssume that g has exactly 2 cycles. By the previous lemmas, we get that\nm = 2 and \u03c4 = 1, one of the \u03c3i must be an r\u2013cycle, and the other \u03c3i has two\ncycles, with lengths relatively prime to r.\nWe need to determine the groups which arise this way. The description\nof the product action as in [33] shows that there is a primitive group U with\nsocle S acting on \u2206 = {1, 2, . . . , r}, such that S \u00d7 S E A \u2264 (U \u00d7 U) \u22ca C2 .\nLet g = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) be the element with the two cycles from above. Then\n(\u03c32 , \u03c31 ) \u2208 (U \u00d7 U) \u22ca C2 . Thus U contains an r\u2013cycle, and an element\nwith two cycles of coprime lengths. In particular, U is not contained in the\nalternating group Ar , and so is not simple. Furthermore, U is not affine.\nTaking Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 together gives that either U = PGL2 (p) for a\nprime p \u2265 5, or U = S r for r \u2265 5. The element g shows that U \u00d7 U \u2264 A,\nbut U \u00d7 U is not primitive, so A = (U \u00d7 U) \u22ca C2 , and the claim follows.\nRemark 3.17. Case 1c of Theorem 3.3, that is A < GL2 (p) for a prime\np > 2 and A1 the group of monomial matrices, can also be seen as a product\naction, namely as A = (AGL1 (p) \u00d7 AGL1 (p)) \u22ca C2 on p2 points.\n\n3.5\n\nRegular Action\n\nAs an immediate consequence of the previous section we obtain\nTheorem 3.18. Let A be a primitive non\u2013affine permutation group with a\nregular normal subgroup. Then A does not contain an element with two\ncycles.\n\n18\n\n\fProof. Let N be a regular normal subgroup of A. Then, by regularity, N is\na minimal normal subgroup of A, so N \u223c\n= Lm for some simple non\u2013abelian\ngroup L and m \u2265 2. Identify N with the set of points A is acting on, and\nlet C be the centralizer of N in the symmetric group S(N) of N. If N acts\nfrom the right on N, then C \u223c\n= N acts from the left on N. Set H = L \u00d7 L,\nand let the first and second component act from the left and from the right,\nrespectively. Then A is contained in the wreath product H \u2240 S m in product\naction, see [33, page 392]. Now apply Theorem 3.3 to see that this cannot\noccur, a distinguishing property of H being that it is not doubly transitive\n(in contrast to PGL2 (p)).\n\n3.6\n\nDiagonal Action\n\nLet S be a non\u2013abelian simple group, and m \u2265 2 an integer. Set N :=\nS m . Let N act on itself by multiplication from the right. Furthermore,\nlet the symmetric group S m act on N by permuting the components, and\nAut(S) act on N componentwise. Define an equivalence relation \u223c on N by\n(l1 , l2 , . . . , lm ) \u223c (cl1 , cl2 , . . . , clm ) for c \u2208 S. The above actions respect the\nequivalence classes, so we get a permutation group D acting on the set N/\u223c\nof size |S|m\u22121 . Note that the diagonal elements of N in right multiplication\ninduce inner automorphisms of S on N/\u223c, for (i\u22121 l1 i, i\u22121 l2 i, . . . , i\u22121 lm i) \u223c\n(l1 , l2 , . . . , lm )(i, i, . . . , i).\nWe say that a permutation group A acts in diagonal action, if it embeds\nas a transitive group of D with N \u2264 A.\nWe begin with a technical\nProposition 3.19. Let S be a non\u2013abelian simple group, m \u2265 2 be an integer, and D be the group in diagonal action as above. Let o(Out(S)) and\no(S) be the largest order of an element in Out(S) and S, respectively. Then\n1\neach element of D has at least o(Out(S))|S|\n(|S|/o(S))m cycles.\nProof. Choose an element in D. Raise it to the smallest power such that the\ncontribution from Out(S) disappears. Let \u03c3 \u2208 N \u22ca S m be this element. Set\n1\n(|S|/o)m cycles.\no = o(S). We are done once we know that \u03c3 has at least |S|\nWrite \u03c3 = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3m )\u03c4 with \u03c4 \u2208 S m and \u03c3i \u2208 S. Let \u03c4 have u cycles of\nlengths \u03c11 , \u03c12 , . . . , \u03c1u .\nWithout loss assume that the first \u03c11 coordinates of N = S m are permuted in an \u03c11 \u2013cycle (1 2 * * * \u03c11 ). Write \u03c1 for \u03c11 . Then \u03c3 \u03c1 acts by right\nmultiplication with\n(\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3\u03c1 ) = (\u03c31 \u03c32 * * * \u03c3\u03c1 , \u03c32 \u03c33 * * * \u03c3\u03c1 \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3\u03c1 \u03c31 * * * \u03c3\u03c1\u22121 ) \u2208 S \u03c1\n19\n\n\fon these first \u03c1 coordinates. Note that all the elements \u03c3i have the same\norder o\u2032 because they are conjugate in S. So, by Lemma 3.14, \u03c3 \u03c1 induces\n|S|\u03c1 /o\u2032 \u2265 |S|\u03c1/o cycles on S \u03c1 , thus \u03c3 induces at least |S|\u03c1/(\u03c1o) cycles on S \u03c1 .\nApply this consideration to the other \u03c4 \u2013cycles and use Lemma 3.15 to see\nthat the number of cycles of \u03c3 on N is at least\nu\nu\nY\n|S|\u03c1i\n|S|m Y 1\n= u\n\u03c1i o\no i=1 \u03c1i\ni=1\n\u0010 u \u0011u\nm\n\u2265 |S|\n,\nmo\nwhere we used the inequality between the arithmetic and geometric mean\nin the last step. But the function (x/(mo))x is monotonously decreasing for\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 mo/e. Note that o \u2265 5 (because a group with element orders \u2264 4 is\nsolvable), so mo/e > m, but u \u2264 m. So the above expression is \u2265 (|S|/o)m.\nFurthermore, the number of cycles of \u03c3 on N is at most |S| times the number\nof cycles on N/\u223c. From that we get the assertion.\nTheorem 3.20. Let A be a primitive permutation group in diagonal action.\nThen A does not contain an element with at most two cycles.\nProof. Suppose there is a counterexample A, with associated simple group\nS. Proposition 3.19 gives, as m \u2265 2,\n|S| \u2264 2o(S)2 o(Out(S)).\n\nIf S is sporadic, then use list 3 on page 54 along with the group orders given\nin the atlas [7] to see that this inequality has no solution. Next suppose that\nS = An is alternating. Then Out(S) = C2 if n 6= 6, and Out(A6 ) = C2 \u00d7 C2 ,\nso o(Out(S)) = 2 in any case (see e.g. [20, II.5.5]). Use the bound o(S) \u2264 en/e\nfrom Proposition 3.23 to see that only n = 5 is possible with m = 2. But\nit is easy to take into account the possible outer automorphism and show\nalong the lines of the previous proposition that the minimal number of cycles\nof an element in A is 4 (all of length 15), or one checks that with a GAP\ncomputation.\nSo we are left with the case that S is simple of Lie type. Using the\ninformation about Out(S) and o(S) in the Tables 2 (page 53) and 1 (page\n52) and in Section 3.10 together with the order of S given for instance in the\natlas [7], one sees that the only group which does fulfill the above inequality\nis S = PSL2 (7). (One also has to use the atlas [7] in some small cases where\nthe given bounds for o(S) are too coarse in order to exclude S.)\nHowever, the proof of the proposition above shows that we have m = 2,\nu = 2, and ord(\u03c31 )ord(\u03c32 ) \u2265 168/4 = 42, hence ord(\u03c31 ) = ord(\u03c32 ) = 7, so \u03c3\nhas at least 1682/(7 * 168) = 24 cycles on S 2 /\u223c, a clear contradiction.\n20\n\n\f3.7\n\nAlmost Simple Action\n\nBy what we have seen so far, the only remaining case is the almost simple\naction. The aim of the following sections is to show that only the cases\nlisted in part 3 of Theorem 3.3 appear. See Section 3.12 where all the results\nachieved in the following sections are bundled to give a proof of this assertion.\nMany cases of almost simple permutation groups can be ruled out by\ncomparing element orders with indices of (maximal) subgroups of almost\nsimple groups, though some other require finer arguments.\nWe make the following\nDefinition 3.21. For a finite group X let \u03bc(X) be the smallest degree of\na faithful, transitive permutation representation of X, and o(X) the largest\norder of an element in X.\nWe use the trivial\nLemma 3.22. Let A be a transitive permutation group of degree n, and let\n\u03c3 \u2208 A have two cycles in this action. Then\nn \u2264 2ord(\u03c3)\nn \u2264 3ord(\u03c3)/2, if n is odd.\n\n3.8\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nAlternating Groups\n\nUsing methods and results from analytic number theory, one can show that\nthe logarithm of the maximal order of an element in S n is asymptotically\n\u221a\nn log n, see [29, \u00a761]. Here, the following elementary but weaker result\nis good enough for us \u2013 besides, we need an exact bound rather than an\nasymptotic bound anyway.\nn/e\nProposition 3.23. The order\nfor all\n\u221a of an element in S n is at most e\nn/2\nn \u2208 N, and at most (n/2)\nfor n \u2265 6. (Here e = 2.718 . . . denotes the\nEuler constant.)\n\nProof. Let \u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , . . . , \u03bdr be the different cycle lengths > 1 of an element\ng \u2208 S n . Then\nord(g) = lcm(\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , . . . , \u03bdr ) \u2264 \u03bd1 \u03bd2 * * * \u03bdr ,\nand\n\u03bd1 + \u03bd2 + * * * + \u03bdr \u2264 n.\n21\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe inequality between the arithmetic and geometric mean yields\nord(g) = lcm(\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , . . . , \u03bdr )\n\u2264 \u03bd1 \u03bd2 * * * \u03bdr\n\u0012 P \u0013r\n\u03bdi\n\u2264\nr\n\u0010 n \u0011r\n.\n\u2264\nr\n\nThe function x 7\u2192 (n/x)x is increasing for 0 < x \u2264 n/e, and decreasing for\nx > n/e. From that we obtain the first inequality.\nSuppose that \u03bd1 < \u03bd2 < * * * < \u03bdr . Then \u03bdi \u2265 i + 1, and we obtain\nn\u2265\n\nX\n\n\u03bdi \u2265 2 + 3 + * * * + r + (r + 1) =\n\nr2\nr 2 + 3r\n> .\n2\n2\n\n\u221a\nIf n > 2e2 = 14.7 . . . , then r < 2n < n/e, and the claim follows from the\nmonotonicity consideration above. Check the cases 6 \u2264 n \u2264 14 directly.\nNow suppose that An \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(An ) for n \u2265 5. Note that except for\nn = 6, Aut(An ) = S n by [20, II.5.5]. We exclude n = 6 in this section, and\ntreat this case in Section 3.10 about classical groups, because A6 \u223c\n= PSL2 (9).\nSo A1 is a maximal subgroup of A not containing An . Let \u03c3 \u2208 A have at\nmost two cycles on A/A1 . We regard A1 as a subgroup of S n \u2265 A in the natural action on {1, 2, . . . , n} points. There are three possibilities for A1 with\nrespect to this embedding: A1 is intransitive, or transitive but imprimitive,\nor primitive. We treat these three possibilities separately.\nA1 intransitive. A1 leaves a set of size m invariant, with 1 \u2264 m < n.\nDenote by Mm the subsets of size m of {1, 2, . . . , n}. By maximality of A1\nin A and transitivity of A on Mm we see that A1 is the full stabilizer in A of\na set of m elements, thus the action of A is given by the action on Mm . If\nm = 1, then we have the natural action of A, leading to case 3a in Theorem\n3. So for the remainder assume m \u2265 2.\nFirst consider the case that \u03c3 is an n\u2013cycle\nin the natural\n\u0001\n\u0001 action. One of\nn\nn\nthe two cycles of \u03c3 has length at least m\n/2, so n \u2265 m\n/2 \u2265 n(n \u2212 1)/4,\nthus n = 5. This case really occurs, and gives case 3b in Theorem 3.\nNext suppose that \u03c3 is not an n\u2013cycle. Then \u03c3 leaves (on {1, 2, . . . , n})\na set S of size 1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 n/2 invariant. Without loss m \u2264 n/2 (as the action\non the m\u2013sets is the same as the action on the (n \u2212 m)\u2013sets). Note that \u03c3\ncannot be an (n\u22121)\u2013cycle by an order argument as above. So we can assume\n|S| \u2265 2. For i = 0, 1, 2 choose sets Si of size m, such that i points of Si are in\n22\n\n\fS, and the remaining m \u2212 i points are in the complement of S. Then these\nthree sets of course are not conjugate under <\u03c3>.\nA1 transitive but imprimitive. Let 1 < u < n be the size of the blocks\nof a non\u2013trivial system of imprimitivity. Then v := n/u is the number of\nblocks, and A1 = (S u \u2240 S v ) \u2229 A = ((S u )v \u22ca S v ) \u2229 A in the natural action (not\nto mistake with the product action).\nThe index of A1 in A thus is n!/((u!)v v!). We will use the bounds in\nLemma 3.22 and Proposition 3.23 to see that this case does not occur. The\nproof is based on the following\nLemma 3.24. Let u, v \u2265 2 be integers, then\nu!v v! <\n\n1 (uv)!\n,\n2 euv/e\n\n(4)\n\nexcept for (u, v) = (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), and (2, 3).\nProof. We contend that if the inequality (4) holds for (u, v), then it holds\nalso for (u, v + 1). First\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013u\n\u0012\n3\n3\n\u2264\n,\n3 < 4.31 . . . =\ne1/e\ne1/e\nhence\neu/e < 3u\u22121 \u2264 (v + 1)u\u22121 .\nThis implies\n(v + 1)eu/e < (v + 1)u .\nBut\nv+1\u2264\n\nuv + i\ni\n\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , u, so taking the product over these i yields\n\u0013\n\u0012\nuv + u\nu\n,\n(v + 1) \u2264\nu\nso\nu/e\n\n(v + 1)e\n\n\u2264\n23\n\n\u0012\n\nuv + u\nu\n\n\u0013\n\n(5)\n\n\fby (5). Multiply the resulting inequality\nu!(v + 1) <\n\n(uv + u)!\n(uv)!eu/e\n\nwith (4) to obtain the induction step for v.\n\u0001\nNext we show that (4) holds for v = 2 and u \u2265 7. As 2u\nappears\nu\nas \u0001the biggest binomial coefficient in the expansion of (1 + 1)2u , we obtain\n2u\n1\n22u . Inequality (4) for v = 2 reduces to\n\u2265 2u+1\nu\n\u0012 \u0013\n2u\n> 4e2u/e .\nu\n\nSo we are done once we know that\n1\n22u > 4e2u/e ,\n2u + 1\nwhich is equivalent to\n\u0012\n\n2\ne1/e\n\n\u00132u\n\n> 4(2u + 1).\n\nBut it is routine to verify this for u \u2265 7.\nIn order to finish the argument, one verifies (4) directly for u < 7 and the\nleast value of v where the inequality is supposed to hold.\nAs uv \u2265 5 and uv 6= 6 by our assumption, we have the only case u = 4,\nv = 2. But 8!/(4!2 2!) = 35, and the maximal order of an element in S 8 is 15,\ncontrary to Lemma 3.22.\nA\nNow suppose that A1 is primitive on {1, 2, . . . , n}, hence\n1 primitive.\n\u0002 n+1\n\u0003\n!\n\u2264\n[S\n:\nA\nn\n1 ] by a result of Bochert, see [2] or [55, 14.2]. Here [x]\n2\ndenotes the biggest integer less than or equal x. As A has index at most 2\nin S n , we obtain from Lemma 3.22 and Proposition 3.23\n\u0014\n\u0015\nn+1\n! \u2264 2[A : A1 ] \u2264 4en/e .\n2\nHowever, one verifies that for n = 9 and 12 the following holds\n\u0014\n\u0015\nn+1\n! > 4en/e .\n2\n24\n\n(6)\n\n\fBut if (6) holds for some n \u2265 9, then it holds for n + 2 as well, as the left side\ngrows by the factor [(n + 3)/2], whereas the right side grows by the factor\ne2/e < [(n + 3)/2].\nSo we are left to look at the cases n \u2208 {5, 7, 8, 10}.\nSuppose n = 5. The only maximal transitive subgroup of S 5 not containing A5 is A := C5 \u22ca C4 , and the only maximal transitive subgroup of A5 is\nA \u2229 A5 = C5 \u22ca C2 . So the index is 6, and these cases indeed occur and give\n3c in Theorem 3 for p = 5.\nNow assume n = 7. The only transitive subgroups of S 7 which are maximal subject to not containing A7 are AGL1 (7) and PSL3 (2). Of course, the\nindex of AGL1 (7) in S 7 is much too big. The group PSL3 (2) is contained\nin A7 , and has index 15. But the maximal order of an element in A7 is\n7 < 15/2, so this case does not occur by Lemma 3.22.\nNow assume n = 8. Similarly as above, we see that the only case which\ndoes not directly contradict Lemma 3.22 is A1 = AGL3 (2) inside PSL4 (2) \u223c\n=\nA8 . But then A = PSL4 (2) in the natural degree 15 action on the projective\nspace. Lemma 3.49 shows that this case actually does not occur.\nFinally, if n = 10, then we keep Bochert's bound, but use\n\u221a Proposition\n3.23 to see that the order of an element in S 10 is at most 5 5 = 36.55 . . . ,\nhence at most 36. (The exact bound is 30.) So 5! \u2264 2 * 36 by Lemma 3.22, a\ncontradiction.\n\n3.9\n\nSporadic Groups\n\nLet S be one of the 26 sporadic groups. Table 3 on page 54 contains information about small permutation degrees, big element orders, and the outer\nautomorphism group. The atlas [7] contains all this information except for\nthe maximal subgroups of the Janko group J4 , the Fischer groups F i22 , F i23 ,\nand F i\u203224 , the Thompson group T h, the baby monster B, and the monster\ngroup M. For the groups J4 , F i22 , F i23 , and T h we find the necessary information in [28], [27], [26], and [35], respectively. The bounds for the groups\nF i\u203224 , B, and M are not sharp, and have been obtained as follows from the\ncharacter tables in [7]: If M is a proper subgroup of S with index n, then\nthe permutation character for the action of S on S/M is the sum of the\ntrivial character and a character of degree n \u2212 1 which does not contain the\ntrivial character. Thus n \u2212 1 is at least the degree of the smallest non\u2013trivial\ncharacter of S. (In view of the applications we have in mind we could have\nused this argument in most other cases as well.)\nNow S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S) for a sporadic group S. Let \u03c3 \u2208 A be an element\nwith only two cycles in the given permutation action. By Lemma 3.22 we\n\n25\n\n\fget \u03bc(S) \u2264 2|Out(S)|o(S). We see that the only possible candidates for S\nare the five Mathieu groups.\nThe atlas [7] provides the permutation characters of the simple groups\nof not too big order on maximal subgroups of low index. In the case of\nthe Mathieu groups in the representations which are possible, we thus can\nimmediately read off the cycle lengths of an element. Namely the atlas also\ntells in which conjugacy class a power of an element lies, so we can compute\nthe fixed point numbers of all powers of a fixed element.\nS = M11 . Then A = M11 either in the natural action of degree 11, or in\nthe action of degree 12. The degree 11 case cannot occur for the following\nreason. By Lemma 3.22 ord(\u03c3) \u2265 (2/3)11, so ord(\u03c3) = 8 or 11. An element\nof order 11 is an 11\u2013cycle. An element of order 8 has a fixed point, so if it\nwould have two cycles, the other cycle length had to be 10, which is nonsense.\nNow look at the degree 12 action. Then of course an element of order 11 has\ncycle lengths 1 and 11, and one readily checks that an element of order 8 has\ncycle lengths 4 and 8, whereas an element of order 6 has a fixed point, hence\nmust have more than 2 cycles.\nS = M12 . The smallest degree of a faithful primitive representation of\nAut(M12 ) is 144 (see [7]), which is considerably too big. So we have A = M12\nin its natural action. As M11 < M12 , the elements of order 11 and 8 in M11\nwith only two cycles appear also in M12 . Besides them, an element of order\n10 has cycle length 2 and 10, and an element in one of the two conjugacy\nclasses of elements of order 6 has cycle lengths 6.\nS = M22 . We have the natural action of S of degree 22, and A \u2264 M22 \u22caC2 .\nAn element of order 11 has two cycles of length 11. An element in S of order\n8 has cycle lengths 2, 4, 8, 8, so this element cannot be the square of an\nelement with only 2 cycles. An element of order 7 has one fixed point, so it\ncannot arise either. And an element in S of order 6 has 6 cycles, so is out\ntoo.\nS = M23 . Here A = M23 in the natural action of degree 23. An element\nof order 23 is a 23\u2013cycle. Looking at the fixed points of elements of order\n3 and 5 we see that an element of order 15 has cycle lengths 3, 5, and 15.\nSimilarly, an element of order 14 has cycle lengths 2, 7, and 14. So this group\ndoes not occur at all.\nS = M24 . Here A = M24 in the action on 24 points. One quickly checks\nthat the elements of order 14 and 15 have a fixed point, so they do not occur.\nThe elements of order 23, 21, and from one of the two conjugacy classes of\nelements of order 12 have indeed two cycles of the lengths as claimed.\n\n26\n\n\f3.10\n\nClassical Groups\n\nSuppose that S is a classical group. Our goal is to show that S = PSLm (q),\nand that except for a few small cases, the action is the natural one on the\nprojective space over Fq . The main tool for doing that are good upper bounds\nfor element orders in automorphism groups of classical groups.\n3.10.1\n\nElement Orders in Classical Groups\n\nThe following lemma controls the maximal possible orders of elements in\nlinear groups, if they are decorated with a field automorphism.\nLemma 3.25. Let q be a power of the prime p, Fp be an algebraic closure of\nFp , and G \u2264 GLn (Fp ) be a connected linear algebraic group defined over Fp .\nFor E a subfield of Fp , denote by G(E) the group G \u2229 GLn (E) of E\u2013rational\nelements.\nSuppose that E is finite, and let \u03b3 \u2208 Aut(E). Then G(E) is normalized\nby <\u03b3>. Take g = \u03b3h in the semidirect product of <\u03b3> with G(E), where\nh \u2208 G(E). Let f be the order of \u03b3, and F the fixed field in E of \u03b3. Then g f\nis conjugate in G to an element in G(F ).\nProof. Clearly <\u03b3> normalizes G(E), as G is defined over Fp . We compute\ng f = h\u03b3\n\nf \u22121\n\n* * * h\u03b3 h,\n\nthus\n(g f )\u03b3 = hg f h\u22121 .\nExtend \u03b3 to Fp , and denote the induced action on G also by \u03b3. By Lang's\nTheorem (see [51, Theorem 10.1]), the map w 7\u2192 w \u03b3 w \u22121 from G to G is\nsurjective. Thus there is b \u2208 G with\nh = b\u03b3 b\u22121 .\nTherefore\n(b\u22121 g f b)\u03b3 = b\u22121 g f b,\nso b\u22121 g f b is fixed under \u03b3, hence contained in G(F ).\nIn order to apply this lemma, we need the following easy estimate:\nLemma 3.26. Let q, f, r be positive integers such that 2f \u2264 q. Then f *\nq r/f \u2264 q r .\n27\n\n\fProof. We have\nq r(1\u22121/f ) \u2265 2r(f \u22121) \u2265 2f \u22121 \u2265 f,\nand the claim follows after multiplying with q r/f .\nLemma 3.27. Let q be a power of the prime p. Let \u03c3 \u2208 GLn (q) act indecomposably on V := Fnq . Then the order of \u03c3 divides pb (q u \u2212 1), where u\nb u\ndivides n, and pb\u22121 \u2264 n/u \u2212 1 if b > 0. Furthermore, \u03c3 p (q \u22121)/(q\u22121) is a\nscalar, and pb (q u \u2212 1) \u2264 q n \u2212 1. So in particular ord(\u03c3) \u2264 q n \u2212 1, and the\norder of the image of \u03c3 in PGLn (q) is at most (q n \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1).\nProof. Write \u03c3 = \u03c3p\u2032 \u03c3p , where \u03c3p\u2032 and \u03c3p are the p\u2032 \u2013prime part and p\u2013part\nof \u03c3, respectively. Let\nV = U1 \u2295 U2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Um ,\nbe a decomposition into irreducible \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013modules. Such a decomposition exists\nby Maschke's Theorem.\nLet U be the sum of those Ui which are \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic to U1 . As \u03c3p\n\u03c3\ncommutes with \u03c3p\u2032 , we get that Ui p is \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic to Ui for each i. By\nJordan\u2013H\u00f6lder, U is a \u03c3\u2013invariant direct summand of V . The indecomposability of V with respect to \u03c3 gives U = V , so all Ui are \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic.\nLet u be the common dimension of Ui , so n = um. By Schur's Lemma,\nthe restriction of \u03c3p\u2032 to each Ui can be identified with an element of the\nmultiplicative group of Fqu . As \u03c3 commutes with \u03c3p\u2032 , we can consider \u03c3 and\n\u03c3p as elements in GLm (q u ). So either \u03c3p = 1, or pb := ord(\u03c3p ) \u2264 p(m \u2212 1)\nby Lemma 3.5. Also, with respect to this identification, \u03c3p\u2032 is a diagonal\n(q u \u22121)/(q\u22121)\nmatrix. So \u03c3p\u2032\nacts as a scalar \u03bbi \u2208 F\u22c6q on Ui . However, the \u03bbi are\nindependent of i, because the Ui are \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic.\nTo finish the claim, we need to show that pb (q u \u2212 1) \u2264 q um \u2212 1. This is\nclear for b = 0. For b \u2265 1, this follows from pb \u2264 p(m \u2212 1) and\nq um \u2212 1\n= 1 + q u + * * * + q u(m\u22121) \u2265 1 + q u (m \u2212 1) > pb .\nqu \u2212 1\n(Note that b \u2265 1 implies m > 1.)\nWe obtain the following consequence\nProposition 3.28. Let q be a prime power, and n \u2265 2.\n1. If \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393Ln (q), then ord(\u03c3) \u2264 q n \u2212 1.\n28\n\n\f2. If \u03c3 \u2208 P\u0393Ln (q), then ord(\u03c3) \u2264 (q n \u22121)/(q\u22121), except for (n, q) = (2, 4).\nProof. First assume that \u03c3 \u2208 GLn (q), and denote by \u03c3 the image of \u03c3 in\nPGLn (q). Let Fnq =: V = V1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Vr be a decomposition of V into \u03c3\u2013\ninvariant and \u03c3\u2013indecomposable modules Vi . Let ni be the dimension of Vi .\nBy Lemma 3.27, the order of the restriction of \u03c3 to Vi divides ai := pbi (q ui \u22121),\nwhere ui divides ni , and ai \u2264 q ni \u22121. The order of \u03c3 divides the least common\nmultiple of the ai . First suppose that r > 1. Then q \u2212 1 divides each ai , so\nord(\u03c3) \u2264 lcm(a1 , . . . , ar )\n\u2264 (a1 * * * ar )/(q \u2212 1)\n\u2264 (q n1 \u2212 1) * * * (q nr \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\n\u2264 (q n \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1).\nIf however r = 1, then Lemma 3.27 applies directly. So in either case, (a)\nand (b) hold for GLn (q) and PGLn (q), respectively.\nNow assume that \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393Ln (q) \\ GLn (q), and let f be the smallest positive\ninteger with \u03c3 f \u2208 GLn (q). Note that f \u2265 2. By Lemma 3.25, \u03c4 := \u03c3 f is\nconjugate to an element \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 GLn (r), where r := q 1/f . (We take the natural\ninclusion GLn (r) < GLn (q).) Part (a) is clear, as, by what we saw already,\nord(\u03c3) \u2264 f ord(\u03c3 f ) < f r n \u2264 q n , where we used Lemma 3.26 in the last step.\nPart (b) requires a little more work. We have, similarly as above,\nord(\u03c3) \u2264 f\nand are done once we know that\nf\n\nrn \u2212 1\n,\nr\u22121\n\nrn \u2212 1\nr nf \u2212 1\nqn \u2212 1\n\u2264 f\n=\nr\u22121\nr \u22121\nq\u22121\n\nwhich is equivalent to\nf\n\nrf \u2212 1\nr nf \u2212 1\n\u2264 n\n.\nr\u22121\nr \u22121\n\n(7)\n\nNote that (xf \u2212 1)/(x \u2212 1) = 1 + x + * * * + xf \u22121 is strongly monotonously\nincreasing for x > 1, so inequality (7) holds once it holds for n = 2. In this\ncase, we have to show that f \u2264 (r f + 1)/(r + 1). It is easy to see that this\nlast inequality holds except for f = 2, r = 2. But then (7) is equivalent to\n6 \u2264 2n + 1, which is clearly the case for n \u2265 3.\nRemark. P\u0393L2 (4) is indeed an exception for part (b) of the previous theorem. Note that P\u0393L2 (4) \u223c\n= S 5 , so this group contains an element of order\n6 > 5 = (42 \u2212 1)/(4 \u2212 1).\n29\n\n\fLemma 3.29. Let V be a vector space of dimension n \u2265 2 over Fq with a\nnon\u2013degenerate bilinear form \u03ba = (*, *). Let \u03c4 \u2208 Isom(V, \u03ba) be an isometry\nwith respect to this form, and assume that \u03c4 is irreducible on V . Then n is\neven and the order of \u03c4 divides q n/2 + 1.\nProof. By Schur's Lemma we have V \u223c\n= Fqn , and the action of \u03c4 induced on\n\u2217\nFqn is by multiplication with \u03bb \u2208 Fqn , where Fq [\u03bb] = Fqn . The eigenvalues\ni\nof \u03c4 then are the powers \u03bbq for i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1. Let vi \u2208 V \u2297 Fqn be\ni\nan eigenvector to the eigenvalue \u03bbq . The form (*, *) extends naturally to a\nnon\u2013degenerate form on V \u2297 Fqn . Thus there exists i with (v0 , vi ) = c 6= 0.\ni\ni\ni\ni\nThis gives c = (v0\u03c4 , vi\u03c4 ) = (\u03bbv0 , \u03bbq vi ) = \u03bb1+q (v0 , vi ) = \u03bb1+q c, so \u03bb1+q = 1.\nThus \u03bb \u2208 Fq2i , so n | 2i. But i < n, hence 2i = n, and the claim follows.\nLemma 3.30. Let V be a vector space over the finite field F with a non\u2013\ndegenerate symmetric, skew\u2013symmetric, or hermitian form \u03ba = (*, *). Write\nF = Fq if \u03ba is bilinear, and F = Fq2 if \u03ba is hermitian. Let \u03c3 \u2208 Isom(V, \u03ba) be\nan isometry with respect to \u03ba. Suppose that \u03c3 is semisimple and orthogonally\nindecomposable, but reducible on V . Then the following holds:\nV = Z \u2295Z \u2032 , where Z and Z \u2032 are \u03c3\u2013irreducible and totally isotropic spaces\nof the same dimension. Let \u039b and \u039b\u2032 be the set of eigenvalues of \u03c3 on Z and\nZ \u2032 , respectively. Then\n(\n{\u03bb\u22121 | \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} if \u03ba is bilinear,\n\u039b\u2032 =\n{\u03bb\u2212q | \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} if \u03ba is hermitian.\nFurthermore, if \u03ba is not skew\u2013symmetric, then Z is not \u03c3\u2013isomorphic to\nZ \u2032.\nProof. Let Z be a \u03c3\u2013invariant subspace of minimal positive dimension, in\nparticular Z is \u03c3\u2013irreducible. Also Z \u22a5 is \u03c3\u2013invariant. Furthermore, Z is\ntotally isotropic, for otherwise V = Z\u22a5Z \u22a5 by irreducibility of Z. As \u03c3\nis semisimple, there is a \u03c3\u2013invariant complement Z \u2032 of Z \u22a5 in V . From\ndim(Z \u2032 ) = dim(V ) \u2212 dim(Z \u22a5 ) = dim(Z) and the minimality of dim(Z) we\nget that Z \u2032 is \u03c3\u2013irreducible as well. We get V = Z \u2295 Z \u2032 once we know that\nZ \u2295 Z \u2032 is not degenerate. But this follows from\n(Z \u2295 Z \u2032 ) \u2229 (Z \u2295 Z \u2032 )\u22a5 = (Z \u2295 Z \u2032 ) \u2229 Z \u22a5 \u2229 (Z \u2032 )\u22a5\n= Z \u2229 (Z \u2032 )\u22a5\n= {0},\n\nwhere the latter equality holds because Z \u2032 is a complement to Z \u22a5 , therefore\nZ is not contained in (Z \u2032 )\u22a5 .\n30\n\n\fNext we show the assertion about the eigenvalues if \u03ba is bilinear. Let \u03bb\nbe an eigenvalue of \u03c3 with eigenvector v \u2208 Z \u2297 Fq . Let w \u2208 Z \u2032 \u2297 Fq be such\nthat V \u2297 Fq is the span of w and v \u22a5 , and that w is an eigenvector of \u03c3. Let\n\u03bc be the corresponding eigenvalue. By construction, \u03c1 := (v, w) 6= 0, hence\n\u03c1 = (v, w) = (v \u03c3 , w \u03c3 ) = (\u03bbv, \u03bcw) = \u03bb\u03bc\u03c1,\nand the claim follows, as we can also switch the role of Z and Z \u2032 in this\nargument.\nThe case that \u03ba is hermitian is completely analogous.\nFinally, suppose that \u03ba is not skew\u2013symmetric, and assume in contrary\nthat there is a \u03c3\u2013isomorphism \u03c6 : Z 7\u2192 Z \u2032 . Let R = Fq [\u03c3] \u2264 End(V )\nbe the algebra generated by \u03c3. As \u03ba is not skew\u2013symmetric, there is an\nelement v \u2208 V with (v, v) 6= 0. Write v = z + z \u2032 with z and z \u2032 in Z and\nZ \u2032 , respectively. Clearly z and z \u2032 are non\u2013zero. By Schur's Lemma, R acts\nsharply transitively on the non\u2013zero elements of Z \u2032 , in particular, there is\n\u03c1 \u2208 R such that (z \u03c6 )\u03c1 = z \u2032 . Let \u03c8 : Z 7\u2192 V be the homomorphism defined\nby w \u03c8 := w +(w \u03c6 )\u03c1 . This map is clearly injective, \u03c8 commutes with \u03c3, so the\nimage Z \u03c8 has the same dimension as Z, and of course is \u03c3\u2013irreducible as well.\nBy construction, the element v = z \u03c8 is not isotropic, so Z \u03c8 is not totally\nisotropic, thus \u03ba restricted to Z \u03c8 is not degenerate. We get V = Z \u03c8 \u22a5(Z \u03c8 )\u22a5 ,\ncontrary to indecomposability.\nRemark. Let V be 2\u2013dimensional with a non\u2013degenerate skew\u2013symmetric\nform, and \u03c3 the identity map. As V is clearly not the orthogonal sum of two\n1\u2013dimensional spaces, we cannot dispense of the assumption that \u03ba is not\nskew\u2013symmetric in the last part of the lemma.\nWe now extend the previous lemma to those \u03c3 which are not necessarily\nsemisimple.\nLemma 3.31. Let V be a vector space over Fq with a non\u2013degenerate symmetric, skew\u2013symmetric, or hermitian form \u03ba = (*, *). Let \u03c3 \u2208 Isom(V, \u03ba)\nbe an isometry with respect to this form. Assume that \u03c3 is orthogonally indecomposable, but reducible on V . Denote by \u03c3p\u2032 the p\u2032 \u2013part of \u03c3. Then the\nfollowing holds:\nV = (U1 \u22a5U2 \u22a5 . . . \u22a5Ur )\u22a5((Z1 \u2295 Z1\u2032 )\u22a5 . . . \u22a5(Zs \u2295 Zs\u2032 )),\nwhere the Ui , Zi and Zi\u2032 are \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013irreducible, the Ui and (Zi \u2295 Zi\u2032 ) are not\ndegenerate, the Zi and Zi\u2032 are totally isotropic and the Ui , Zi and Zi\u2032 have all\nthe same dimension. Also, r + 2s \u2265 2.\n31\n\n\fProof. Choose an orthogonal decomposition of V into non\u2013trivial \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013invariant\nsubspaces of maximal length, so these subspaces do not decompose orthogonally into smaller \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013invariant spaces. Let the Ui be those subspaces which\nare \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013irreducible, and let the (Zi \u2295 Zi\u2032 ) be the remaining ones according to\nthe previous lemma.\nThe \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013homogeneous components H1 , H2 , . . . are \u03c3\u2013invariant as a consequence of Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder. Let H be the sum of those Hk where the irreducible\nsummands of Hk have the same dimension as those of H1 . Then Zi appears\nin H if and only if Zi\u2032 appears in H. The orthogonal indecomposability of \u03c3\nforces H = V .\nSuppose that r + 2s < 2. Then s = 0 and r = 1, that is \u03c3 is irreducible\non V = U1 , a contradiction.\nLemma 3.32. Let q \u2265 2 and m1 , m2 , . . . , m\u03c1 be distinct positive integers\nwith sum m. Then\n\u03c1\nY\ni=1\n\n(q mi + 1) \u2264 e1/(q\u22121) q m .\n\nProof. For x real we have 1 + x \u2264 ex . Substitute x = 1/q mi and multiply by\nq mi to obtain\nm\n\nq mi + 1 \u2264 q mi e1/q i .\nMultiply these inequalities for i = 1, 2, . . . , \u03c1 to obtain\nY\n(q mi + 1) \u2264 q m e\u03a3 ,\n\nwith\n\n\u03a3=\n\n\u03c1\n\u221e\nX\nX\n1\n1\n1\n\u2264\n=\n,\nmi\nk\nq\nq\nq\n\u2212\n1\ni=1\nk=1\n\nas the mi are distinct. The claim follows.\nLemma 3.33. Use the notation from Lemma 3.31 with \u03ba bilinear, and let\nz be the common dimension of the spaces Zi , Zi\u2032 , Ui . Set w := r + 2s, thus\nv := dim(V ) = wz. Then there is a non\u2013negative integer b, such that ord(\u03c3)\ndivides pb (q z \u2212 1). Furthermore,\n\uf8f1\n[v/2]\n\uf8f4\nin any case,\n\uf8f22q\n[v/2]\nord(\u03c3) \u2264 q\nif ord(\u03c3) is odd,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 [v/2]\nq\nif q is even, and (q, w, z) 6= (2, 2, 2) or (2, 3, 2),\n32\n\n\fIf q = 2 and v = 4 or 6 and ord(\u03c3) > 2v/2 , then ord(\u03c3) = 6 if v = 4, and\nord(\u03c3) = 12 if v = 6.\nProof. As the spaces Zi , Zi\u2032 , and Ui are all \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013irreducible of dimension z, it\nfollows that the order of \u03c3p\u2032 divides q z \u2212 1. Let pb be the order of the p\u2013part\nof \u03c3. As w \u2265 2, hence z \u2264 [v/2], the stated inequalities clearly hold for\nb = 0. Thus assume b \u2265 1 from now on.\nFirst assume p > 2. We are clearly done except if\npb (q z \u2212 1) > 2q [wz/2].\n\n(8)\n\nFrom (8) we obtain\npb q z > 2q [wz/2].\nAs each factor except 2 is divisible by p, we obtain from that even sharper\npb q z \u2265 pq [wz/2] ,\nhence\npb\u22121 q z \u2265 q [wz/2] .\n\n(9)\n\nLet w \u2032 be the number of elements in a maximal subset of the summands Zi ,\nZi\u2032 , and Ui which are pairwise \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic. Then the restriction of \u03c3p to\nthe sum of these spaces can be seen as an element in GLw\u2032 (q z ), so the order\nof this restriction is bounded by p(w \u2032 \u2212 1), see Lemma 3.5. Clearly w \u2032 \u2264 w,\nhence pb\u22121 \u2264 w \u2212 1. So with (9) we obtain further\nw \u2212 1 \u2265 q [wz/2]\u2212z .\nWe first contend that w \u2264 5, and that z = 1 if w > 2. For suppose z \u2265 2.\nThen [wz/2] \u2212 z \u2265 w \u2212 2, as w \u2265 2. So w \u2212 1 \u2265 q w\u22122, which gives w = 2.\nIs is easy to see that w \u2212 1 \u2265 q [w/2]\u22121 gives w \u2264 5. Suppose w = 4 or 5.\nWe obtain q = 3. Furthermore, b \u2264 2, so b = 2 for otherwise we are done\n(check (9)). As V decomposes into 1\u2013dimensional eigenspaces for \u03c33\u2032 , the\neigenvalues are in F3 \\ {0}, so we have that ord(\u03c33\u2032 ) is at most 2, hence the\norder of \u03c3 is at most 2 * 32 = 18, the exact bound we wanted to prove (and\nwhich is sharp indeed).\nNow suppose w = 3. Clearly b = 1. We have either r = 3, s = 0, or\nr = 1, s = 1. In the first case \u03c3p\u2032 restricts to an element of order at most 2\non each Ui , so the order of \u03c3 divides 2p, and the claim follows. Thus assume\nr = 1, s = 1. Let \u03bb be the eigenvalue of \u03c3p\u2032 on U1 . Clearly \u03bb = \u00b11. Also, \u03bb\n33\n\n\fis an eigenvalue on Z1 or Z1\u2032 , for otherwise U1 were \u03c3\u2013invariant, contrary to\northogonal irreducibility. By Lemma 3.30 the eigenvalues on Z and Z \u2032 then\nare \u00b11, so the order of \u03c3p\u2032 is at most 2, and we are done again.\nFinally, we have to look at w = 2. Here we have not necessarily z = 1.\nFirst suppose that s = 0, that is V = U1 \u2295 U2 . The order of \u03c3p\u2032 on V divides\nq [z/2] +1. The claim follows as p(q [z/2] +1) \u2264 2q z = 2q [v/2] . Thus suppose that\nr = 0, s = 1, so V = Z1 \u2295 Z1\u2032 . Let \u03bb \u2208 Fqz be an eigenvalue of \u03c3p\u2032 on Z1 . By\ni\nirreducibility, the eigenvalues of \u03c3p\u2032 on Z1 are \u03bbq for i = 0, 1, . . . , z \u2212 1. By\nLemma 3.30, the inverses of these eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of \u03c3p\u2032 on Z1\u2032 .\nWe contend that these two sets are the same. Namely as \u03c3 is not semisimple,\n\u03c3\nit cannot leave invariant both Z1 and Z1\u2032 . So without loss Z1 p 6= Z1 , and\nwe obtain that Z1 and Z1\u2032 are \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic by Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder. So the set\nof eigenvalues on Z1 is closed under inversion, in particular there is an i\ni\n2i\nsuch that \u03bb\u22121 = \u03bbq . This gives \u03bbq \u22121 = 1, so \u03bb \u2208 Fq2i . We obtain that\nz divides 2i < 2z, as Fqz = Fq [\u03bb]. If i = 0, then \u03bb = \u00b11, so \u03c3p\u2032 has\norder at most 2, and the claim clearly follows, as b = 1. If i > 0, then\nz = 2i, so the order of \u03c3p\u2032 divides q z/2 + 1, and the claim follows again from\n(q z/2 + 1)p < 2q z/2q \u2264 2q z = 2q [v/2] .\nWe are left to look at the case p = 2. As the form is not degenerate, we\nhave necessarily v = wz even. We proceed similarly as above. Recall that\nb \u2265 1. We are done unless\n2b (q z \u2212 1) > q wz/2.\n\n(10)\n\nFrom that we obtain\n2b > q wz/2\u2212z ,\nhence\n2b\u22121 \u2265 q wz/2\u2212z\nand\nw \u2212 1 \u2265 q wz/2\u2212z ,\n\n(11)\n\nas 2b\u22121 \u2264 w \u2212 1. If z \u2265 2, then w \u2212 1 \u2265 q w\u22122 , hence either w = 3, q = 2,\nz = 2; or w = 2. The first case gives 2b\u22121 \u2264 w \u2212 1 = 2, so b \u2264 2, hence\nord(\u03c3) = 12 or \u2264 6 < 23 = 2v/2 .\nThus we have z = 1 except possibly for w = 2. First assume w > 2, so\nw \u2265 4 is even. We obtain w \u2264 6 from (11). Suppose w = 6. Then q = 2\nand b \u2264 3, and we obtain a contradiction to (10). Next suppose w = 4.\n34\n\n\fAgain q = 2. From (10) we obtain 2b > 22 , hence b \u2265 3, a contradiction to\n4 \u2264 2b\u22121 \u2264 w \u2212 1 = 3.\nFinally, suppose w = 2. Clearly b = 1. The argument from the last\nparagraph in the case p > 2 shows that the critical case is when z is even\nand ord(\u03c3) divides 2(q z/2 + 1). Now\n2(q z/2 + 1) = q z \u2212 ((q z/2 \u2212 1)2 \u2212 3) \u2264 q z = q [v/2]\nexcept for q = 2, z = 2.\nProposition 3.34. Let \u03c3 \u2208 GLn (q) be an isometry with respect to a non\u2013\ndegenerate skew\u2013symmetric or symmetric bilinear form on Fnq . Then\n\uf8f1 [n/2]\n2q\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2q [n/2]\nord(\u03c3) \u2264\n\uf8f4\ne1/(q\u22121) q [n/2] < 2q [n/2]\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(3e/2)2[n/2]\n\nif\nif\nif\nif\n\nq\nq\nq\nq\n\nis odd,\nand ord(\u03c3) are odd,\n6= 2 is even,\n= 2.\n\nProof. Choose a decomposition of V into orthogonally indecomposable \u03c3\u2013\ninvariant subspaces. The order of \u03c3 is the least common multiple of the\norders of the restriction of \u03c3 to these subspaces. Lemmas 3.29 and 3.33 give\nupper bounds for these orders.\nIn the following we use several times the trivial inequality\n[u1 /2] + [u2 /2] + * * * + [uk /2] \u2264 [(u1 + u2 + * * * + uk )/2]\nfor integers ui .\nFirst suppose that q is odd. Let U be such a subspace of dimension u.\nIf U is \u03c3\u2013irreducible, then ord(\u03c3|U ) is at most q [u/2] + 1, so the order is at\nmost (q [u/2] + 1)/2 \u2264 q [u/2] if ord(\u03c3|U ) is odd, and at most q [u/2] + 1 \u2264 2q [u/2]\notherwise. The assertion follows if U = V . So suppose U < V . By induction,\nthe stated bound holds for the restriction of \u03c3 to U \u22a5 . Let u = dim(U \u22a5 ). If\nthe orders of the restriction of \u03c3 to U and U \u22a5 are relatively prime, then at\nleast one of the orders is odd, and we obtain the claim by multiplying the\ncorresponding upper bounds. If these orders are not relatively prime, then\nthe product of these orders divided by 2 is an upper bound for the order of\n\u03c3, so the claim holds as well.\nNow suppose that q is even. Let Wi be those subspaces from above\non which \u03c3 acts irreducibly, and let W be the sum of these spaces. Set\nw := dim(W ), and let 1 < w1 < w2 < . . . be the distinct dimensions of the\nspaces Wi . Note that if dim(Wi ) = 1, then the restriction of \u03c3 to Wi is trivial.\n35\n\n\fBy Lemma 3.29, the wi are even, and the order of the restriction of \u03c3 to the\nassociated space divides q wi/2 + 1. Thus the order of \u03c3|W divides the product\nof the q wi /2 + 1. This product is less than e1/(q\u22121) q [w/2] by Lemma 3.32. If\nq 6= 2, then apply the bounds in Lemma 3.33 to the summands of W \u22a5 to get\nthe claim. Finally suppose q = 2. We are done except if one of the summands\nQ of W \u22a5 has dimension 4 or 6, and \u03c3|Q has order 6 or 12, respectively. The\nstated inequality then holds for W \u22a5Q. If there are more such summands Q\u2032\n\u2032\nin W \u22a5 , then they do contribute at most by a factor 2 < 2[dim(Q )/2] to the\norder of \u03c3. All other summands of dimension r contribute by a factor of at\nmost 2[r/2] , so the claim follows.\nAt a few places we need the following trivial\nLemma 3.35. Let 1 \u2264 i < m and q \u2265 2 be integers. Let \u03b5 be \u22121 or 1. Then\n(q m + \u03b5)(q m\u22121 \u2212 \u03b5)\n> q 2m\u22121\u2212i .\nqi \u2212 1\nProof. Clearly q m\u2212i \u22121 \u2265 \u03b5(q \u22121). Multiply by q m\u22121 to get q 2m\u22121\u2212i \u2212q m\u22121 \u2265\n\u03b5(q m \u2212 q m\u22121 ), hence q 2m\u22121\u2212i \u2212 1 > \u03b5(q m \u2212 q m\u22121 ). But this inequality is\nequivalent to the stated one.\nAs before denote by \u03bc(S) and o(S) a lower bound for the degree of a\nfaithful permutation representation and an upper bound for the order of\nan element, respectively. The minimal permutation degrees \u03bc(S) have been\ndetermined by Cooperstein and Patton \u2013 we use the \"corrected\" list [25, Theorem 5.2.2] which still contains a mistake (giving the wrong \u03bc for P \u03a9+\n2m (3)).\n\u223c\nWe exclude the group PSL2 (5), as PSL2 (5) = A5 , a case we already dealt\nwith. Besides that, the list [25, Theorem 5.2.2] contains a few duplications.\nAccordingly, we drop PSp4 (3) in view of PSp4 (3) \u223c\n= PSU4 (2) and Sp4 (2)\u2032 in\nview of Sp4 (2)\u2032 \u223c\n= PSL2 (9).\nAssume that the almost simple group A acts primitively and contains an\nelement with at most two cycles. We consider the case that the minimal\nnormal subgroup S of A is a classical group. The aim of this section is to\nshow that S is isomorphic PSLm (q), a case to be handled afterwards.\n3.10.2\n\nS Symplectic\n\n36\n\n\fLemma 3.36.

Let q = pr with p a prime. If q is odd, then Out(S) = C2 \u00d7 Cr , see\n[25, Theorem 2.1.4, Prop. 2.4.4], where Cr comes from a field automorphism.\nThus \u03c3 2 has a preimage \u03c4 in Sp2m (q) \u22ca Aut(Fq ). Let f be the order of\nthe associated field automorphism. By Lemma 3.25, \u03c4 f is conjugate to an\nelement in the group Sp2m (q 1/f ), whose element orders are bound by 2q m/f\nby Proposition 3.34. Thus \u03c4 has order at most 2f q m/f \u2264 2q m , where we used\nLemma 3.26. The claim follows in the odd case.\nIf q is even, then Out(S) = Cr if m \u2265 3. Argue as above. If m = 2,\nthen Out(S) is cyclic of order 2r, and the square of a generator is a field\nautomorphism, see [6, Chapter 12]. The claim follows as above.\nNow we rule out the symplectic groups in the order as they appear in\nTable 1 on page 52.\nm \u2265 2, q \u2265 3, (m, q) 6= (2, 3). Let \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(S). The minimal faithful\npermutation degree of S is (q 2m \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1). As q \u2265 3, we get ord(\u03c3) \u2264 4q m\nby the previous Lemma. So Lemma 3.22 gives\nq 2m \u2212 1\n\u2264 2ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2 * 4 * q m .\nq\u22121\nNote that the left hand side is bigger than q 2m\u22121 , so it follows that q m\u22121 < 8.\nThus m = 2 and q \u2264 7. But (74 \u2212 1)/(7 \u2212 1) = 400 > 392 = 8 * 72 , so q = 7 is\nout. Thus q = 4 or 5. But ord(\u03c3) \u2264 20 for q = 4, and ord(\u03c3) \u2264 30 for q = 5,\nsee the atlas [7]. These improved bounds contradict the above inequality.\nm \u2265 3, q = 2. We get \u03bc(S) = 2m\u22121 (2m \u22121) \u2264 2(3e/2)2m , hence 2m \u22121 \u2264\n6e, so m = 3 or 4. If m = 4, then the atlas gives ord(\u03c3) \u2264 30, contrary to\n\u03bc(S) \u2264 2ord(\u03c3). Thus m = 3. The atlas gives ord(\u03c3) \u2264 15, and the next\nbiggest element order is 12. Also, there is a maximal subgroup of index\n28, and the next smallest has index 36. So ord(\u03c3) = 15 and n = 28. But\n15 = lcm(k, 28\u2212k) has no solution, therefore \u03c3 must have more than 2 cycles\nin this representation.\n37\n\n\f3.10.3\n\nS Orthogonal in Odd Dimension\n\nLemma 3.37.

Let \u03ba be the bilinear form associated to S. First suppose that m \u2265 5.\nAssume q odd first. Then \u03c3 2f has a preimage in Isom(F2m\nq , \u03ba), this follows\nfrom the structure of the automorphism group of S, see [25, Theorem 2.1.4,\nTable 2.1.D]. Now apply Proposition 3.34, and note that 2f \u2264 q.

We have Out(P \u03a9+\n8 (q)) = S 3 \u00d7Cf if q is even,\nand \u223c\n= S 4 \u00d7Cf if q is odd, see [25, p.38]. Thus if q is odd, then either \u03c3 3f or\n\u03c3 4f has a preimage in Isom(F2m\nq , \u03ba), so ord(\u03c3) is at most 4f times the maximal\n38\n\n\forder of an element in Isom(F2m\nq , \u03ba), and we use Proposition 3.34 again. If\nq 6= 2 is even, then analogously ord(\u03c3) \u2264 3f e1/(q\u22121) q 4 \u2264 3e1/3 f q 4 < (9/2)f q 4.\nIf q = 2, then use the atlas information [7].\nm \u2265 4, q \u2265 4.

First assume q odd. Similarly as above we obtain\nq 6 < 16f q 4 \u2264 8q 5 . Note that if f = 1, then q < 4, a contradiction. Thus\nassume f \u2265 2.

But this contradicts the sharper bound ord(\u03c3) \u2264 4 * 34 =\n324. If q = 2, then 22m\u22122 < 2 * (3e/2)2m , hence 2m\u22122 \u2264 3e = 8.1 . . . , so\nm \u2264 5. Arrive at a contradiction using the upper bounds for ord(\u03c3) from\nLemma 3.39.\n\n3.10.6\n\nS Unitary\n\nLemma 3.40. Suppose that \u03c3 \u2208 GUn (q) acts irreducibly on Fnq . Then n is\nodd, and ord(\u03c3) divides q n + 1. The order of the image of \u03c3 in PGUn (q)\ndivides (q n + 1)/(q + 1).\nProof. Let \u03bb be an eigenvalue of \u03c3. Then Fq2 [\u03bb] = Fq2n . All the eigenvalues\n2i\nof \u03c3 are \u03bbq with i = 1, * * * , n. Similarly as in the proof of Lemma 3.29,\n2i\nthere exists an index i in the given range such that \u03bb\u2212q = \u03bbq , so\n\u03bbq\n\n2i\u22121 +1\n\n= 1.\n\n(12)\n\n4i\u22122\n\nIt follows that \u03bbq \u22121 = 1, so \u03bb \u2208 Fq4i\u22122 . Therefore n | 2i \u2212 1 < 2n, so\nn = 2i \u2212 1. The assertion about the order of \u03c3 follows from (12). By the\nirreducibility, the element \u03c3 is a subgroup of a Singer group of order q 2n \u2212 1\non Fnq2 . The (unique) subgroup of order q + 1 of this Singer group consists of\nscalars, because q + 1 divides q 2 \u2212 1. Also, q + 1 divides q n + 1, so modulo\nscalars \u03c3 has order at most (q n + 1)/(q + 1).\nLemma 3.41. Let \u03c3 \u2208 GUn (q), and denote by \u03c3 the image of \u03c3 in PGUn (q).\nLet q = pf with p prime. The following holds.\n1. If n = 1, then ord(\u03c3) divides q + 1.\n2. If n = 2, then ord(\u03c3) divides q 2 \u2212 1 or p(q + 1).\n3. If n = 3, then ord(\u03c3) divides q 3 + 1, q 2 \u2212 1, or pr (q + 1) with r \u2264 2\nand r = 1 if p > 2. Furthermore, ord(\u03c3) divides q 2 \u2212 q + 1, q 2 \u2212 1 or\np(q + 1). For p = 2, there is the additional possibility ord(\u03c3) = 4.\n4. If n = 4, then ord(\u03c3) divides q 3 + 1, q 3 \u2212 q 2 + q \u2212 1, or pr (q 2 \u2212 1) where\nr \u2264 2 and r = 1 if p > 2. For p = 3, there is the additional possibility\nord(\u03c3) = 9.\n\n40\n\n\fProof. Denote by \u03c3p\u2032 the p\u2032 \u2013part of \u03c3. Set F = Fq2 , so GUn (q) is the isometry\ngroup of the unique hermitian from on F n .\nThe case n = 1 is trivial.\nSuppose that n = 2. By Lemma 3.40, \u03c3 is reducible on V = F n . If \u03c3 is\nsemisimple, then the eigenvalues of \u03c3 are in F , so ord(\u03c3) | q 2 \u2212 1. If \u03c3 is not\nsemisimple, then \u03c3p\u2032 is the centralizer of an element of order p, hence \u03c3p\u2032 is\na scalar, and the claim follows again.\nNow assume n = 3. If \u03c3 is irreducible, then apply Lemma 3.40. If \u03c3 is\northogonally decomposable, then apply (a) and (b) to get that ord(\u03c3) divides\nq 2 \u22121 or p(q+1). Next assume \u03c3 reducible, but orthogonally indecomposable.\nChoose a maximal orthogonal decomposition of V in \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013invariant subspaces.\nBy Lemma 3.30 and the notation from there, either V = U1 \u22a5U2 \u22a5U3 , or\nV = U1 \u22a5(Z1 \u2295 Z1\u2032 ). Assume the first possibility. By orthogonal irreducibility\nof \u03c3, the Ui are pairwise \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic, thus \u03c3p\u2032 is a scalar on V , with order\ndividing q + 1. Let pr be the order of the p\u2013part of \u03c3. Then pr\u22121 \u2264 2 by\nLemma 3.5, and we get the divisibilities as stated. If we have the latter\northogonal decomposition, then U1 must be \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic to Z1 or Z1\u2032 , say\nto Z1 . On the other hand, Z1 and Z1\u2032 are not \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic by Lemma 3.30.\nWe get that \u03c3p leaves invariant U1 \u22a5Z1 and Z2 , thus the order of \u03c3p divides\np. The order of \u03c3p\u2032 divides q + 1, because the restriction to U1 satisfies this,\nso this holds also for the restriction to Z1 , and then also for the restriction\nto Z1\u2032 by Lemma 3.30.\nNow assume n = 4. Let pb be the order of \u03c3p . First assume that \u03c3p\u2032\nis orthogonally decomposable. From (a), (b), and (c), we get that ord(\u03c3p\u2032 )\ndivides q 2 \u2212 1 or q 3 + 1. If the latter occurs, then b = 0. If b \u2265 2, then b = 2,\nand either p = 3, and \u03c33 acts indecomposably on V , or p = 2. In the former\ncase \u03c33\u2032 must be a scalar, so ord(\u03c3) divides 9. Next assume that \u03c3p\u2032 acts\northogonally indecomposably on V . Then V = Z1 \u2295 Z1\u2032 with dim(Z1 ) = 2.\n2\nLet \u03bb \u2208 Fq4 be an eigenvalue on Z1 . Then the other eigenvalue is \u03bbq ,\n3\nand Lemma 3.30 tells us that the eigenvalues on Z1\u2032 are \u03bb\u2212q and \u03bb\u2212q . Set\nm = q 3 \u2212q 2 +q \u22121. Raising these 4 eigenvalues to the m\u2013th power gives equal\n4\nvalues (use \u03bbq = \u03bb), hence \u03c3pm\u2032 is a scalar. Also, \u03c3p = 1, because Z1 and Z1\u2032\nare not \u03c3p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic by Lemma 3.30. We get the stated divisibilities.\nLemma 3.42. Let q = pf \u2265 3 for a prime p. Then each element in\nAut(PSU4 (q)) has order at most max(2, f ) * (q 3 + 1).\nProof. Let \u03c3 \u2208 GU4 (q) \u22ca Gal(Fq2 /Fp ) be a preimage of a given element\n\u03c3 \u2208 Aut(PSU4 (q)). Let r be smallest positive integer with \u03c3 r \u2208 GU4 (q), so r\ndivides 2f . If r < 2f , then r \u2264 f , and \u03c3 r \u2208 PGU(4, q), so the claim follows\n41\n\n\ffrom ord(\u03c3) \u2264 f ord(\u03c3 r ) and Lemma 3.41. Also, if f = 1, we are obviously\ndone. Therefore we are concerned with r = 2f with f \u2265 2.\nBy Lemma 3.25, we get that \u03c3 2f is conjugate to an element in GL4 (p),\nand an upper bound for the element orders in the latter group is p4 , see\nProposition 3.28. Thus ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2f p4 . From f \u2265 2 we obtain 2f p4 <\nf (p6 + 1) \u2264 f (q 3 + 1), and we are done.\nLemma 3.43. Let S = PSUn (q) be the simple unitary group with n \u2265 3,\nand \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(S). Then\n(\n2q n\nif q is odd,\nord(\u03c3) \u2264\nn\n(3e/2)q\nin any case.\nProof. Write q = pf with p a prime. Then \u03c3 has a preimage \u03c4 in GUn (q) \u22ca\nGal(Fq2 /Fp ). Under restricting the scalars to Fp , we obtain an embedding of\nn\nthe latter group into Isom(F2f\np , \u03ba), where \u03ba is a symmetric non\u2013degenerate\nFp \u2013bilinear form. Now apply the bounds in Proposition 3.34 to obtain the\nclaim.\nWe rule out the unitary groups in the order as they appear in the list 1\non page 52. So suppose that S = PSUm (q).\nm = 3, q 6= 2, 5. First suppose that f \u2265 2, so q > p. By Lemma 3.41 and\nthe structure of the automorphism group of PSUm (q) given in [25, Prop. 2.3.5]\nwe get ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2f (q 2 \u2212 1). But \u03bc(S) = q 3 + 1, so q 3 + 1 \u2264 2 * 2f (q 2 \u2212 1),\nhence q 2 \u2212 q + 1 \u2264 4f (q \u2212 1). This shows q 2 \u2212 q < 4f (q \u2212 1), so 3f \u2264 q < 4f ,\ncontrary to f \u2265 2.\nNext suppose f = 1, so q = p. We obtain ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2p(p + 1). Thus\n3\np + 1 \u2264 4p(p + 1), so p2 \u2212 p + 1 \u2264 4p, therefore p \u2212 1 < 4, so p = 3. Check\nthe atlas [7] to see that ord(\u03c3) \u2264 12, so this case is out by 33 + 1 > 2 * 12.\nm = 3, q = 5. Then Out(S) = S 3 and o(Aut(S)) = 30. Thus the degree\nis at most 60. But the only representation of S with degree \u2264 60 has degree\n50, see [7]. Now o(S) = 10, so A > S. As S.3 does not have a permutation\nrepresentation of degree 50, we have A = S.2. However, o(S.2) = 20, and\nthis case is out too.\nm = 4. Suppose q 6= 2 for the moment. First suppose f \u2265 2. Then\nord(\u03c3) \u2264 f (q 3 +1) by Lemma 3.42. We obtain (q+1)(q 3 +1) = \u03bc(S) \u2264 2f (q 3 +\n1), hence q + 1 \u2264 2f . But q \u2265 2f \u2265 2f , so there is no solution. Next suppose\nf = 1, so q = p. We obtain p+1 \u2264 4, so p = 3. However, the maximal element\norder in Aut(PSU4 (3)) is 28, see the atlas [7], a contradiction. Similarly, if\nq = 2, then o(Aut(PSU4 (2))) = 12, which is too small.\n\n42\n\n\f6 | m, q = 2. Use Lemma 3.43 to get 2m\u22121 (2m \u2212 1)/3 \u2264 2(3e/2)2m =\n6e2\n, hence 2m \u2212 1 \u2264 18e = 48.9 . . . , so m \u2264 5, a contradiction.\nm \u2265 5, (m, q) 6= (6m\u2032 , 2). From Lemma 3.35 we obtain \u03bc(S) > q 2m\u22123 .\nOn the other hand, ord(\u03c3) \u2264 (3e/2)q m by Lemma 3.43, so q 2 \u2264 q m\u22123 \u2264\n3e = 8.1 . . . , thus q = 2 and m = 5. (Also m = 6 would fulfill the inequality, but this is excluded here.) However, in this case \u03bc(S) = 165, whereas\no(Aut(S)) = 24, see the atlas [7], a contradiction.\nm\u22121\n\n3.10.7\n\nProjective Special Linear Groups\n\nNow we assume that S = PSLn (q), and show that except for some small\ncases, only the expected elements can act with at most 2 cycles in the natural\nrepresentation.\nIn this section, we use results by Tiep and Zalesskii [52, Section 9] on the\nthree smallest faithful permutation degrees for the simple groups PSLn (q).\nUnfortunately, their result is mis\u2013stated. Apparently they mean to give the\ndegrees of the three smallest faithful primitive permutation representations.\nIn order to make use of their result, we need a little preparation.\nLemma 3.44. Let S be a simple non\u2013abelian group, and n = \u03bc(S) be the\ndegree of the smallest faithful permutation representation. Let A be a group\nbetween S and Aut(S). If A has a primitive permutation representation on\n\u03a9 such that S is imprimitive on \u03a9, then |\u03a9| \u2265 3n.\nProof. Suppose that S acts imprimitively on \u03a9, and assume that |\u03a9| < 3n.\nLet \u2206 be a non\u2013trivial block for S, and M be a setwise stabilizer in S of\nthis block. Primitivity of A forces transitivity of S on \u03a9, in particular S is\ntransitive on the block system containing \u2206. As there must be at least n\nblocks by assumption,\nn|\u2206| \u2264 |\u03a9| < 3n,\nhence |\u2206| < 3, so |\u2206| = 2. Let A1 be the stabilizer of a point in A. Set\nS1 = S \u2229 A1 , a point\u2013stabilizer in S. Clearly [M : S1 ] = |\u2206| = 2, so S1 is\nnormal in M. Also, S1 is normal in A1 , and maximality of A1 in A forces\nA1 = NA (S1 ). So M \u2264 A1 , a contradiction.\nLemma 3.45. Let S = PSLn (q) with (n, q) 6= (4, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4),\n(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), or (2, 11). Let A be a group with S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S).\nSuppose that A acts primitively, and there is \u03c3 \u2208 A with at most two cycles\nin this action. Then S is primitive as well.\n\n43\n\n\fProof. In these cases the natural action of S on the \u03bc = (q n \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\nlines of Fnq is the one of smallest possible degree. Let N be the degree of the\naction of A. Suppose that S is imprimitive. From Lemma 3.44 we obtain\nN \u2265 3\u03bc. If \u03c3 \u2208 P\u0393Ln (q), then ord(\u03c3) \u2264 \u03bc by Proposition 3.28, contrary to\nLemma 3.22. Thus \u03c3 involves a graph automorphism of PSLn (q), hence also\nn \u2265 3.\nAs \u03c3 2 \u2208 P\u0393Ln (q), we have ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2\u03bc, hence N \u2264 4\u03bc. Let A1 be a\npoint\u2013stabilizer in A, and set S1 = A1 \u2229 S. Let M be a maximal subgroup\nof S containing S1 . Then [S : M] \u2264 [S : S1 ]/2 \u2264 2\u03bc, so it follows easily\nfrom [52, Section 9] that M fixes a line (or hyperplane) with respect to\nthe natural action, except possibly for (n, q) = (3, 2). Exclude this single\nexception for a moment. As A = A1 S by transitivity of S, also A1 involves\na graph automorphism \u03c4 . As A1 normalizes S1 , and the action of \u03c4 on S\ninterchanges point\u2013stabilizers with hyperplane\u2013stabilizers, we get that there\nis a hyperplane H < Fnq and a line L < Fnq , such that S1 fixes H and L.\nClearly, S acts transitively on the q n\u22121 (q n \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1) non\u2013incident line\u2013\nhyperplane pairs, and also transitively on the (q n \u2212 1)(q n\u22121 \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)2\nincident line\u2013hyperplane pairs. The latter size is smaller than the former, so\nN \u2265 (q n \u22121)(q n\u22121 \u22121)/(q\u22121)2 = (q n\u22121 \u22121)/(q\u22121)\u03bc. From N \u2264 2ord(\u03c3) \u2264 4\u03bc\nwe obtain 1 + q + * * * + q n\u22122 \u2264 4. Hence n = 3 and q = 3 or 2. However,\nfor q = 3 we have ord(\u03c3) \u2264 13 by [7], contrary to N \u2265 52. If q = 2, then\nAut(S) \u223c\n= PGL2 (7), so ord(\u03c3) \u2264 8, but N \u2265 21, a contradiction.\nIt remains to check the case (n, q) = (3, 2). Then Aut(S) \u223c\n= PGL2 (7),\nso ord(\u03c3) \u2264 8, hence N \u2264 16. But this contradicts the above estimation\nN \u2265 3\u03bc = 21.\nLemma 3.46. Let S = PSLn (q) with (n, q) 6= (4, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4),\n(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 11) and S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S). Assume that A acts\nprimitively on \u03a9. Suppose that \u03c3 \u2208 A has at most 2 cycles on \u03a9. Then either\nA \u2264 P\u0393Ln (q) and A acts naturally on the lines of Fnq , or (n, q) = (3, 2), and\nA \u2264 Aut(PSL3 (2)) \u223c\n= PGL2 (7) acts naturally of degree 8.\nProof. Let N = |\u03a9| be the permutation degree of A, and suppose that we do\nnot have the natural action of S = PSLn (q) on the points of the projective\nspace.\nAs \u03c3 2 \u2208 P\u0393Ln (q), we get ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2(q n \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1) by Proposition 3.28.\nS is primitive by the previous lemma, so we can use the results by Tiep\nand Zalesskii [52, Section 9] on the three smallest primitive permutation\ndegrees for the simple groups PSLn (q), see the comment before Lemma 3.44.\n\n44\n\n\fFirst suppose that n \u2265 4, and if n = 4, then q 6= 2. Then\nN\u2265\n\n(q n \u2212 1)(q n\u22121 \u2212 1)\n.\n(q 2 \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1)\n\n(This second smallest primitive representation is given by the action on the\n2\u2013spaces in Fnq .) Now use N \u2264 2ord(\u03c3) to obtain q n\u22121 \u2212 1 \u2264 4(q 2 \u2212 1).\nSo n = 4 and q = 3. (Note that (n, q) = (4, 2) is already excluded from\nthe statement of the lemma.) But o(Aut(PSL4 (3))) = 40 by the atlas [7],\nwhereas N = 130 > 2 * 40, so this case is out.\nNext assume n = 3. Using [52, Section 9], one easily verifies that N \u2265\n3\nq \u2212 1 except for q = 4 and 2. Exclude q = 2 and 4 for a moment. So\nq 3 \u2212 1 \u2264 4(q 3 \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1), hence q = 3 or 5. But for q = 5, we actually have\nN \u2265 52 (53 \u2212 1), but ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2(53 \u2212 1)/(5 \u2212 1), clearly a contradiction. If\nq = 3, then N \u2265 144, contrary to ord(\u03c3) \u2264 2(33 \u2212 1)/(3 \u2212 1) = 26. Now\nsuppose q = 4. The atlas [7] gives ord(\u03c3) \u2264 21, whereas N \u2265 56 > 2 * 21\nby [52, Section 9], a contradiction. If q = 2, and we do not have the natural\naction, then necessarily N = 8, which corresponds to the natural action of\nPGL2 (7) \u223c\n= Aut(PSL3 (2)).\nFinally we have to look at n = 2. As A \u2264 P\u0393L2 (q) now, we have ord(\u03c3) \u2264\n(q 2 \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1) = q + 1.\nWe go through the cases in [52, Section 9]. If q > 4 is an even square,\n\u221a\nthen 2(q + 1) \u2265 N \u2265 q(q + 1), hence q \u2264 4, a contradiction. If q is an\n\u221a\nodd square 6= 9, 49, then 2(q + 1) \u2265 N \u2265 q(q + 1)/2, hence q \u2264 16, a\ncontradiction. If q \u2208 {19, 29, 31, 41}, then 2(q + 1) \u2265 N \u2265 q(q 2 \u2212 1)/120,\nso q \u2264 16, a contradiction. If q = 17 or q = 49, then N = 102 or 175,\nrespectively, so these cases do not occur. If q is not among the cases treated\nalready (and 6= 7, 9, and 11,) then N \u2265 q(q \u2212 1)/2, so q(q \u2212 1) \u2264 4(q + 1),\nhence q \u2264 5, a contradiction.\nLemma 3.47. Let S = PSL2 (q) with q = 9 or 11 and S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S).\nAssume that A acts primitively on \u03a9, and that there exists \u03c3 \u2208 A with at\nmost 2 cycles on \u03a9. Then either A \u2264 P\u0393L2 (q) and A acts naturally on the\nlines of Fnq , or q = 9, A \u2264 S 6 < Aut(PSL2 (9)) acting naturally on 6 points,\nor q = 11, |\u03a9| = 11, A = PSL2 (11), and \u03c3 is an 11\u2013cycle.\nProof. Suppose q = 9. We have S \u223c\n= A6 , and the maximal subgroups of S\nhave index 6, 10, and 15, respectively. Of course, the degree 6 occurs. Degree\n10 corresponds to the natural action of S. The degree 15 corresponds to A6\nacting on 2\u2013sets. Then A \u2264 S 6 , and one verifies easily that each element\nhas \u2265 3 cycles. This settles the case that S is primitive. If S is imprimitive,\n45\n\n\fthen N \u2265 3 * 6 = 18 by Lemma 3.44, but also N \u2264 2ord(\u03c3) \u2264 20. As A\ncontains no element of order 9, we actually have N = 20. Hence ord(\u03c3) = 10,\nso PGL2 (9) \u2264 A. But neither PGL2 (9) nor P\u0393L2 (9) act primitively on 20\npoints, e.g. by the argument in the proof of Lemma 3.44.\nNext suppose q = 11. As ord(\u03c3) \u2264 12, we have N \u2264 24, but 24 < 33 =\n3 * \u03bc(S), so S is primitive. The maximal subgroups of S of index \u2264 24 have\nindex 11 and 12, and correspond to the actions covered by the claim.\nLemma 3.48. Let P\u0393Ln (q) act naturally on the lines of Fnq for n \u2265 2. Suppose that an element \u03c3 \u2208 P\u0393Ln (q) \\ PGLn (q) has at most 2 cycles. Then\n(n, q) = (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 8), or (2, 9).\nProof. Let \u03b3g \u2208 GLn (q) \u22ca Aut(Fq ) be a preimage of such a \u03c3, with \u03b3 \u2208\nAut(Fq ) and g \u2208 GLn (q). Then\nord(\u03b3g) \u2265\n\n1 qn \u2212 1\n.\n2 q\u22121\n\nLet f \u2265 2 be the order \u03b3. By Lemma 3.25, (\u03b3g)f is conjugate to an element\nin GLn (q 1/f ), and the orders of elements in this latter group are at most\nq n/f \u2212 1 by Proposition 3.28. Thus\nf (q n/f \u2212 1) \u2265 ord(\u03b3g) \u2265\n\n1 qn \u2212 1\n.\n2 q\u22121\n\n(13)\n\nThis gives\n2f q > 2f (q \u2212 1) \u2265\n\nqn \u2212 1\n> q n\u2212n/f ,\nq n/f \u2212 1\n\nhence\n2f > q n\u2212n/f \u22121 .\nNow use 2f \u2264 2f and q \u2265 2f to obtain\n2f > 2nf \u2212n\u2212f ,\nhence\nn<\n\n2f\nf \u22122\n=4\u22122\n\u2264 4,\nf \u22121\nf \u22121\n\nso n \u2264 3.\n46\n\n(14)\n\n\fFirst suppose n = 3. Then (14) shows f < 3, hence f = 2. Set r = q 1/2 .\n6\nThen (13) gives 2(r 3 \u2212 1) \u2265 21 rr2 \u22121\n, so 4(r 2 \u2212 1) \u2265 r 3 + 1, hence r < 4. One\n\u22121\nverifies easily that r = 3 is not possible, because the maximal order of an\nelement in P\u0393L3 (9) \\ PGL3 (9) is 26, see e.g. [7].\nNext assume n = 2. Again set r = q 1/f \u2265 2. Let h be an element in\nGL2 (r) < GL2 (q) which is conjugate (in GL2 (Fq )) to (\u03b3g)f . Denote by h the\nimage of h in PGL2 (q). There are three possibilities for h: If h is irreducible\non F2q , then ord(h) divides r 2 \u22121, so ord(h) divides (r 2 \u22121)/ gcd(r 2 \u22121, q \u22121).\nBut r \u2212 1 divides the denominator, so ord(h) divides r + 1. Next assume that\nh is reducible. If h is semisimple, then clearly ord(h)|ord(h)|r \u22121. If however\nh has a unipotent part, then this p\u2013part has order p, and its centralizer is\nthe group of scalar matrices. Hence in this case, ord(h) = p \u2264 r.\nWe have seen that ord(h) \u2264 r + 1 in any case, hence ord(\u03c3) \u2264 f (r + 1).\nWe obtain\nf (r + 1) \u2265\n\nq+1\nrf + 1\n=\n,\n2\n2\n\nhence\nrf + 1\n\u2264 2f.\nr+1\nThe left hand side is monotonously increasing in r. For r = 2 we obtain\n2f + 1 \u2264 6f , hence f \u2264 4. For f = 3 and 4 there are only the solutions r = 2.\nIf r > 2, then f = 2 and r = 3 or 4. In order to obtain the claim, we have\nto exclude the possibility q = r f = 16. The previous consideration shows\nthat each element in P\u0393L2 (16) \\ PGL2 (16) has order at most 12. But then\nwe clearly cannot have at most 2 cycles in a representation of odd degree\n17.\nLemma 3.49. Let 2 \u2264 n \u2208 N. Suppose that \u03c3 \u2208 PGLn (q) has at most 2\ncycles in the action on the lines of Fnq . Then one of the following holds:\n1. q is a prime, n = 2, and \u03c3 has order q.\n2. \u03c3 is a Singer cycle or the square of a Singer cycle.\nProof. For a subset S of Fnq denote by P (S) the \"projectivization\" of S,\nnamely the set of 1\u2013dimensional spaces through the non\u2013zero elements of\nS. Denote by \u03c3\u0302 \u2208 GLn (q) a preimage of \u03c3. If \u03c3\u0302 is irreducible on Fnq , then\nSchur's Lemma shows that (b) holds. Thus assume that \u03c3\u0302 is reducible, and let\n0 < U < Fnq be a \u03c3\u0302\u2013irreducible subspace. The assumption shows that <\u03c3>\n47\n\n\fpermutes transitively the elements in P (U), as well as those of P (Fnq \\ U).\nThe transitivity of this latter action shows\nq u divides ord(\u03c3\u0302), where u = dim(U).\n\n(15)\n\nDenote by \u03c3\u0302p and \u03c3\u0302p\u2032 the p\u2013part and p\u2032 \u2013part of \u03c3\u0302, respectively. Let W be\na \u03c3\u0302p\u2032 \u2013invariant complement to U in Fnq . As \u03c3\u0302 is transitive on P (U) and\nP (Fnq /U), we have in particular that \u03c3\u0302 is irreducible on the quotient space\nFnq /U, so \u03c3\u0302p is trivial on this quotient, hence \u03c3\u0302p\u2032 is irreducible on W . From\n(15) we get that \u03c3\u0302p is not trivial, in particular W is not \u03c3\u0302p \u2013invariant. Then we\nsee from Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder that U and W are \u03c3\u0302p\u2032 \u2013isomorphic, so \u03c3\u0302p \u2208 GL2 (q u ).\nThus ord(\u03c3\u0302p ) = p. Combine this with (15) to get n = 2u = 2, and q = p.\nFinally, \u03c3\u0302p\u2032 centralizes \u03c3\u0302p , so must be a scalar, that is \u03c3 has order p.\n\n3.11\n\nExceptional Groups of Lie Type\n\nHere we rule out the case that S is an exceptional group of Lie type. Table 2\non page 53 contains the exceptional group of Lie type S, a lower bound \u03bc(S)\nfor the degree of a non-trivial transitive faithful permutation representation,\nan upper bound o(S) for the orders of elements, the order of the outer automorphism group, and finally restricting condition on q. In the list q = pf for\na prime p.\nThe lower bound for \u03bc(S) has been computed as follows. If S has a\npermutation representation of degree m, and F is any field, then the permutation module of S over F has a submodule of dimension m \u2212 1. So m \u2212 1\nis at least the dimension of the lowest\u2013dimensional projective representation\nof S in characteristic different from the defining characteristic. But these\nminimal dimensions have been determined by Landazuri and Seitz in [30].\nWe use the corrected list [25, Theorem 5.3.9]. Note that if S does not have\na doubly transitive representation, then the (m \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional module is\nreducible, so one summand has dimension at most (m \u2212 1)/2, see [15, 4.3.4].\nThis is the case for all S except for 2 B2 (q) and 2 G2 (q). So \u03bc(S) is then at\nleast 1 plus 2 times the minimal dimension of a representation of S.\nThe upper bound for o(S) has been obtained as follows. Each element of\nS is the product of a p\u2013element with a commuting p\u2032 \u2013element, so we multiply\nupper bounds for each. If l is the Lie rank of S, then the order of p\u2032 \u2013elements\nis at most (q + 1)l , see [34, 1.3A]. The order of a p\u2013element g is bounded\nas follows. Suppose S \u2264 PGLw (F ) for a field F of characteristic p. Then\nthe order of g is a p\u2013power at most p(w \u2212 1), see Lemma 3.5. Small values\nw with an embedding as above are classically known, see [25, Prop. 5.4.13].\nHowever, for the Suzuki groups 2 B2 (q) we used [21, XI, \u00a73] to determine \u03bc\n48\n\n\fand o. To determine \u03bc for G2 (q) and 3 D4 (q) we use the papers by Kleidman\n[23] and [24] respectively.\nNow assume that S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S) and \u03c3 \u2208 A has at most two cycles in\na transitive action of A. Then \u03bc(S) \u2264 2o(A) \u2264 2|Out(S)|o(S). Comparing\nwith the information in the Table 2 on page 53 rules out all but a few little\ncases, which require extra data obtained from\n\u221a the atlas [7].\n2\n2\nS\n=\nB\n(q).\nWe\nget\n1\n+\nq\n\u2264\n2f\n(q\n+\n2q + 1). As q \u2265 8, we have\n2\n\u221a\n5\n2\n2\nf . This\n2q + 1 \u2264 8 q. So we get q < 1 + q \u2264 2f (q + 85 q), hence 2f < 13\n4\n2\nimplies f = 3. But o(Aut( B2 (8))) = 15 (see the atlas [7]), contrary to\n\u03bc(2B2 (8)) = 65 > 2 * 15.\n28\nS =2 G2 (q). We get 1 + q(q \u2212 1) \u2264 2f * 9(q + 1). Now q + 1 \u2264 27\nq,\n56\nf\n2\nwhich gives 3 = q < 3 f + 1, hence f = 3. But \u03bc( G2 (27)) = 19684, see [7],\nwhereas o(2G2 (27)) = 37, so this case is clearly out.\nS = G2 (q). Obviously q \u2265 5. First assume that q is odd. Bound (q 6 \u2212\n1)/(q \u2212 1) from below by q 5 , and q + 1 from above by 6q/5. We then obtain\nq 5 \u2264 2 * 2f * 6p(q + 1)2 \u2264 24q(6q/5)2, hence p2f \u2264 864f /25, which gives q = 5.\nBut then Out(S) has order 1, and when we use the estimations in the table,\nwe get a contradiction. The case p = 2 and f \u2265 3 also does not occur by a\nsimilar calculation.\nS =3 D4 (q). We get (q + 1)(q 8 + q 4 + 1)/2 \u2264 2 * 3f * 8p(q + 1)2 . One\nquickly checks that this holds only for q = 2. But \u03bc(3D4 (2)) = 819, whereas\no(3D4 (2)) = 28 (see [7]), so this case does not occur.\nS =2 F4 (2)\u2032 . This clearly does\n\u221a not occur.\n2\n4\nS = F4 (q). One gets 1 + q 2q(q \u2212 1) \u2264 2f * 32(q + 1)2 , and one easily\nchecks that this inequality has no solutions.\nS = F4 (q). The case q = 2 does not occur. We have 1 + 2q 6 (q 2 \u2212 1) \u2264\n2(2, p)f * 25p(q + 1)4 , which implies that q = 3 or 4. However, Theorem\n[25, 5.3.9] for even q shows that the minimal degree of a 2\u2032 \u2013representation\nof F4 (4) is 1548288, so \u03bc(S) \u2265 3096577. But this violates the estimation\no(F4 (4)) \u2264 31250. So q = 3. The maximal order of a 3\u2032 \u2013element is \u2264 73, see\n[5, page 316]. Furthermore, the 3\u2013order is at most 27. Thus o(S) \u2264 1971.\nBut \u03bc(S) \u2265 11665, a contradiction.\nS =2 E6 (q). We get quickly q = 2. But o(2 E6 (2)) = 35, which is much\ntoo small compared to \u03bc(2 E6 (2)) = 3073.\nS = E6 (q). We quickly get that q = 2, 3, or 4. The p\u2032 \u2013part is bounded\nby 91, 949, and 5061, respectively (again by [5, page 316]), and the p\u2013part is\nbounded by 32, 27, and 32, respectively. So o(S) is at most 2912, 25623, and\n161952, respectively. If we compare this with the estimation for \u03bc(S), then\nonly q = 2 survives. We get \u03bc(S) \u2264 2 * 2 * 2912 = 11648. However, E6 (2)\ncontains F4 (2), and \u03bc(E6 (2)) \u2265 \u03bc(F4 (2)) = 69615 ([7]), a contradiction.\nS = E7 (q). We get q = 2. Use [5, page 316] to obtain o(S) \u2264 171 * 64 =\n49\n\n\f10944. But from the table we have \u03bc(S) \u2265 196609, which is clearly too big.\nS = E8 (q) gives also no examples.\n\n3.12\n\nProof of Part 3 of Theorem 3.3\n\nNow we are ready to prove part 3 of Theorem 3.3, by collecting the information achieved in the last sections. Thus suppose that A acts primitively,\nS \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S) for a non\u2013abelian simple group S, and that A contains an\nelement \u03c3 which has exactly 2 cycles.\nIf S is sporadic, then Section 3.9 gives the possibilities. This is the easiest\ncase, as the result can be directly read off from the atlas information [7]. Only\nthe Mathieu groups M11 , M12 , M22 , and M24 give rise to examples.\nSection 3.8 treats the case that S = An , the alternating group with n \u2265 5.\nThe case n = 6 has been excluded there, and postponed to the analysis of\nthe linear groups, in view of A6 \u223c\n= PSL2 (9). The only examples coming not\nfrom the natural action of S are as follows: S = A5 acting on the 2\u2013sets\nof {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, hence of degree 10 (case 3b), or S = A5 acting on 6 points\n(case 3c for p = 5, note that A5 \u223c\n= PSL2 (5)).\nBy Section 3.11, S cannot be of exceptional Lie type.\nIn Section 3.10 it is shown that if S is a classical group, then S is isomorphic to some PSLn (q).\nThis is dealt with in Section 3.10.7. We can exclude a couple of small\npairs (n, q) in view of exceptional isomorphisms, see [25, Prop. 2.9.1]. As S is\nsimple, (n, q) 6= (2, 2), (2, 3). Also, (n, q) 6= (2, 4), (2, 5), as S = A5 has been\ndealt with already. Also (n, q) 6= (4, 2), as A8 had been ruled out in Section\n3.8. Furthermore, we assume (n, q) 6= (2, 7) in view of PSL2 (7) \u223c\n= PSL3 (2).\nSuppose that q 6= 9, or 11, if n = 2. Then A \u2264 P\u0393Ln (q) acting naturally\non the projective space, or (n, q) = (3, 2), and we have the natural action of\nPSL2 (7) \u223c\n= PSL3 (2) of degree 8, see Lemma 3.46. Lemma 3.47 shows that\nfor (n, q) = (2, 9) the action is either the natural one, or the natural one of\nA6 \u223c\n= PSL2 (9), and for (n, q) = (2, 11), only the natural action is possible.\nIn conclusion, we are left to look at the natural action of PSLn (q) \u2264\nA \u2264 P\u0393Ln (q), and to determine the possibilities for \u03c3. By Lemma 3.48,\nwe have actually \u03c3 \u2208 PGLn (q), except possibly for (n, q) = (3, 4), (2, 8), or\n(2, 9). The case (n, q) = (3, 4) accounts for 3f in Theorem 3. One easily\nverifies that P\u0393L2 (8) does not contain an element with just 2 cycles (but it\ndoes contain 9\u2013cycles not contained in PGL2 (8)!). Similarly, if an element in\nP\u0393L2 (9) \\ PGL2 (9) has only 2 cycles, then \u03c3 \u2208 M10 , and the cycle lengths\nare 2 and 10. This gives case 3e of Theorem 3.\nSo in addition to the assumption that A \u2264 P\u0393Ln (q) acts naturally, we\nmay finally assume \u03c3 \u2208 PGLn (q). Lemma 3.49 finishes this case: Either q\n50\n\n\fis a prime, n = 2, ord(\u03c3) = q (so \u03c3 has cycle lengths 1 and q, case 3c of\nTheorem 3), or \u03c3 is the square of a Singer cycle (case 3d of Theorem 3.3).\nBy the classification theorem of the finite simple groups, we have covered\nall possibilities of S.\n\n51\n\n\f3.13\n\nTables on Minimal Permutation Degrees, Maximal Element Orders, etc.\nTable 1: Classical Groups\nS\nPSLm (q)\n\n\u03bc(S)\n(q m \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\n\nPSL2 (7)\nPSL2 (9)\nPSL2 (11)\nPSL4 (2) \u223c\n= A8\nPSp2m (q)\n\n(q 2m\n\n7\n6\n11\n8\n\u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\n\n2\n4\n2\n2\n(2, q \u2212 1)f, m \u2265 3\n2f, m = 2\n1\n2f\n\n2m\u22121 (2m \u2212 1)\n(q 2m \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\n\nSp2m (2)\n\u03a92m+1 (q)\n\u03a92m+1 (3)\nP\u03a9+\n2m (q)\n\n|Out(S)|\n2(m, q \u2212 1)f, m \u2265 3\n(m, q \u2212 1)f, m = 2\n\n(q m\n\n3m (3m \u2212 1)/2\n\u2212 1)(q m\u22121 + 1)/(q \u2212 1)\n\nP\u03a9+\n2m (2)\n\n2m\u22121 (2m \u2212 1)\n\nP\u03a9+\n2m (3)\n\n3m\u22121 (3m \u2212 1)/2\n\nP\u03a9\u2212\n2m (q)\nPSU3 (q)\nPSU3 (5)\nPSU4 (q)\nPSUm (2)\n\n(q m + 1)(q m\u22121 \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\nq3 + 1\n50\n(q + 1)(q 3 + 1)\n2m\u22121 (2m \u2212 1)/3\n\nPSUm (q)\n\n(q m \u2212(\u22121)m )(q m\u22121 \u2212(\u22121)m\u22121 )\nq 2 \u22121\n\n52\n\n2\n2(4, q m \u22121)f, m 6= 4\n6(4, q m \u22121)f, m = 4\n2, m 6= 4\n6, m = 4\n4, m > 4 odd\n8, m > 4 even\n24, m = 4\n2(4, q m + 1)f\n2(3, q + 1)f\n6\n2(4, q + 1)f\n6\n2(m, q + 1)f\n\nm, q\n(m, q) 6= (2, 5),\n(2, 7), (2, 9),\n(2, 11), (4, 2)\n\nm \u2265 2, q \u2265 3,\n(m, q) 6= (2, 3)\nm\u22653\nm \u2265 3,\nq \u2265 5 odd\nm\u22653\nm \u2265 4, q \u2265 4\nm\u22654\nm\u22654\nm\u22654\nq 6= 2, 5\n6|m\n\nm \u2265 5,\n(m, q) 6= (6m\u2032 , 2)\n\n\fTable 2: Exceptional Groups\nS\n\u03bc(S) \u2265\no(S) \u2264\n|Out(S)|\nq\n\u221a\nB2 (q)\n1 + q2\nq + 2q + 1\nf\nq = 22u+1 > 2\n2\nG2 (q)\n1 + q(q \u2212 1)\n9(q + 1)\nf\nq = 32u+1 > 3\nG2 (3)\n351\n13\n2\nG2 (4)\n416\n21\n2\n6\n2\nG2 (q)\n(q \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\n8(q + 1)\nf\nq \u2265 8 even\n6\n2\nG2 (q)\n(q \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1)\n6p(q + 1)\n\u2264 2f\nq \u2265 5 odd\n3\nD4 (q) (q + 1)(q 8 + q 4 + 1)/(2, q \u2212 1) 7p(q + 1)2\n3f\n2\nF4 (2)\u2032\n1600\n16\n2\n\u221a\n2\nF4 (q)\n1 + q 4 2q(q \u2212 1)\n32(q + 1)2\nf\nq = 22u+1 > 2\nF4 (2)\n69615\n30\n2\n6 2\n4\nF4 (q)\n1 + 2q (q \u2212 1)\n25p(q + 1)\n(2, p)f\nq\u22653\n2\n1 + 2q 9 (q 2 \u2212 1)\n26p(q + 1)4 2(3, q + 1)f\nE6 (q)\nE6 (q)\n1 + 2q 9 (q 2 \u2212 1)\n26p(q + 1)6 2(3, q \u2212 1)f\n15 2\nE7 (q)\n1 + 2q (q \u2212 1)\n55p(q + 1)7 (2, q \u2212 1)f\nE8 (q)\n1 + 2q 27 (q 2 \u2212 1)\n247p(q + 1)8\nf\n2\n\n53\n\n\fTable 3: Sporadic Groups\nGroup S Orders of\nelements\nM11\n11, 8, 6, \u2264 5\nM12\n11, 10, 8, 6, \u2264 5\nM22\n11, 8, 7, 6, \u2264 5\nM23\n23, 15, 14, \u2264 11\nM24\n23, 21, 15, 14, 12, \u2264 11\nJ1\n\u2264 19\nJ2\n\u2264 15\nJ3\n\u2264 19\nJ4\n\u2264 66\nHS\n\u2264 20\nSuz\n\u2264 24\nMcL\n\u2264 30\nRu\n\u2264 29\nHe\n\u2264 28\nLy\n\u2264 67\nO'N\n\u2264 31\nCo1\n\u2264 60\nCo2\n\u2264 30\nCo3\n\u2264 60\nFi22\n\u2264 30\nFi23\n\u2264 60\n\u2032\nFi24\n\u2264 60\nHN\n\u2264 40\nTh\n\u2264 39\nB\n\u2264 70\nM\n\u2264 119\n\n54\n\nIndices of ma|Out(S)|\nximal subgroups\n11, 12, \u2265 55\n1\n12, \u2265 66\n2\n22, \u2265 77\n2\n23, \u2265 253\n1\n24, \u2265 276\n1\n\u2265 266\n1\n\u2265 100\n2\n\u2265 6156\n2\n\u2265 173067389\n1\n\u2265 100\n2\n\u2265 1782\n2\n\u2265 275\n2\n\u2265 4060\n1\n\u2265 2058\n2\n\u2265 8835156\n1\n\u2265 122760\n2\n\u2265 98280\n1\n\u2265 2300\n1\n\u2265 276\n1\n\u2265 3510\n2\n\u2265 31671\n1\n\u2265 8672\n2\n\u2265 1140000\n2\n\u2265 143127000\n1\n\u2265 4372\n1\n\u2265 196883\n1\n\n\f4\n4.1\n4.1.1\n\nGenus 0 Systems\nBranch Cycle Descriptions\nAlgebraic Setting\n\nLet k be a subfield of the complex numbers C, t be a transcendental over\nC, and L/k(t) be a finite Galois extension with groups G. We assume that\nL/k(t) is regular, that means k is algebraically closed in L. Let p1 , p2 , . . . , pr\nbe the places of k(t) which are ramified in L. Then, by a consequence of\nRiemann's Existence Theorem (see [38], [53]), we can choose places Pi of L\nlying above pi , i = 1, 2, . . . , r, and elements \u03c3i \u2208 G such that \u03c3i is a generator\nof the inertia group of Pi , so that the following holds:\nThe \u03c3i , i = 1, 2, . . . , r generate G, and \u03c31 \u03c32 . . . \u03c3r = 1.\nWe call the tuple (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r ) a branch cycle description of the extension\nL/k(t).\nNow let E be a field between L and k(t), and consider G as a permutation\ngroup on the conjugates of a primitive element of E/k(t). Set n := [E : k(t)].\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 G let ind(\u03c3) be n minus the number of cycles of \u03c3. We call ind(\u03c3)\nthe index of \u03c3. This notion obviously applies to any permutation group of\nfinite degree.\nLet gE be the genus of the field E. The Riemann\u2013Hurwitz genus formula\ngives\n2(n \u2212 1 + gE ) =\n\nr\nX\n\nind(\u03c3i ).\n\n(16)\n\ni=1\n\nWe will frequently use this relation for the case that E is a rational field,\nso that in particular gE = 0, and will call the corresponding equation genus\n0 relation, and the tuple (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r ) a genus 0 system.\nThe process of constructing a branch cycle description from the extension\nL/k(t) can be reverted to some extent. Namely let G be any finite group,\ngenerated by \u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r , such that \u03c31 \u03c32 . . . \u03c3r = 1. Then there exists a\nfinite extension k/Q, and a regular Galois extension L/k(t), such that the\n\u03c3i arise exactly as described above. This again follows from (the difficult\ndirection of) Riemann's Existence Theorem. Modern references are [38] and\n[53], where the latter one contains a self\u2013contained treatment.\n4.1.2\n\nTopological Setting\n\nFor explicit computations and a conceptual understanding of branch cycle\ndescriptions, the topological interpretation of the \u03c3i is indispensable. Also\n55\n\n\fCL/C(t) has Galois group G. Again let E be a field between k(T ) and L.\n\u03c0\nThere is a composition of ramified coverings of Riemann surfaces X\u0302 \u2192 X \u2192\nP1 (C), such that the natural inclusion of the fields of meromorphic functions\nC(t) = M(P1 (C)) \u2286 M(X ) \u2286 M(X\u02c6 ) is just the extension C(t) \u2286 CE \u2286 CL.\nIf we identify the places of C(t) with the elements in P1 (C) in the natural\nway, then the branch points of X\u0302 \u2192 P1 (C) are exactly the places of C(t)\nramified in CL.

This topological application in a purely\ngroup theoretic context was first made by Ree, see [45]. Later, Feit, Lyndon,\nand Scott gave an elementary group theoretic argument of this observation,\nsee [12].\nIn this chapter we will determine such systems E for gE = 0 in specific\ngroups G. According to the previous section, we will call such systems genus\n0 systems. If we look for \u03c3i in a fixed conjugacy class Ci , then it does\nnot matter in which way we order the classes, for if \u03c3i and \u03c3i+1 are two\nconsecutive elements in E, then we may replace these elements by \u03c3i+1 and\n\u03c3\n\u03c3i i+1 , respectively.\nThe strategy of finding such genus 0 systems in G (or proving that there\nare none) depends very much on the specific situation. For many small\ngroups, we simply check using a program written in GAP [46]. For bigger\ngroups, especially certain sporadic groups, we can use the character tables in\nthe atlas [7]. Here, and at other places, the following easy observation (see\n[39, 2.4]) is useful.\nLemma 4.1. Let \u03c3 \u2208 G, where G is a permutation group of degree n, then\nind(\u03c3) = n \u2212\n\nX\n1\nord(\u03c3)\n\u03c7(\u03c3 k )\u03c6(\n),\nord(\u03c3)\nk\nk|ord(\u03c3)\n\nwhere \u03c7(\u03c4 ) is the number of fixed points of \u03c4 \u2208 G, and \u03c6 is the Euler \u03c6\u2013\nfunction.\n\n4.3\n\nA Lemma about Genus 0 Systems\n\nLemma 4.2. Let (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r ) be a genus 0 system of a transitive permutation group G. Suppose that all cycle lengths of \u03c31 and \u03c32 are divisible\nby d > 1. Then G admits a block system of d blocks, which are permuted\ncyclically.\nProof. Let n be the degree of G. Let X \u2192 P1 (C) be a connected cover\nof the Riemann sphere, such that (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r ) is the associated branch\ncycle description. Without loss of generality let 0 and \u221e be branch points\ncorresponding to \u03c31 and \u03c32 , respectively. As our tuple is a genus 0 system,\nX has genus 0, thus X = P1 (C) and the cover is given by a rational function\nf (X). We may assume (by a linear fractional change) that \u221e is not mapped\nto 0 or \u221e. Let \u03b1i be the elements in f \u22121 (0), and denote the multiplicity of\n57\n\n\f\u03b1i my mi . Similarly, let \u03b2i have multiplicity ni in the fiber f \u22121 (\u221e). Thus,\nup to a constant factor, we have\nQ\n(X \u2212 \u03b1i )mi\nf (X) = Q\n.\n(X \u2212 \u03b2i )ni\n\nAs the mi and ni are the cycle lengths of \u03c31 and \u03c32 , respectively, we get\nf (X) = g(X)d, where g(X) \u2208 C(X) is a rational function. From that the\nclaim follows.\n\nRemark. The completely elementary nature of the lemma makes it desirable\nto have a proof which does not rely on Riemann's existence theorem. We\nsketch an elementary argument, and leave it to the reader to fill in the details:\nFirst note that if the claimed assertion about the permutation action holds\nfor a group containing G (and acting on the same set), then it holds for G as\nwell. For i > 2 write \u03c3i as a minimal product of transpositions, and replace\nthe element \u03c3i by the tuple of these transpositions. This preserves the genus\n0 condition. Also, the product of a k\u2013cycle with a disjoint l\u2013cycle with a\ntransposition which switches a point of the k\u2013cycle with one of the l\u2013cycle\nis a (k + l)\u2013cycle. This way, we can assume that all cycle lengths of \u03c31 and\n\u03c32 are d, at the cost of extra transpositions, but still preserving the genus\n0 property. Write n = md. Clearly, there are m \u2212 1 transpositions in our\nsystem, such that they, together with \u03c31 , generate a transitive group. Let\n\u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4m\u22121 be these transpositions. As we have a genus 0 system, the total\nnumber of transpositions is 2(m \u2212 1). Using braiding we get an equation of\nthe form\n\u2032\n\u03c31 \u03c41 . . . \u03c4m\u22121 = \u03c32\u2032 \u03c41\u2032 . . . \u03c4m\u22121\n=: \u03c1,\n\nwhere \u03c32\u2032 is conjugate to \u03c32\u22121 , and the \u03c4i\u2032 are transpositions. As ind(xy) \u2264\nind(x)+ind(y) and (\u03c31 , \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4m\u22121 , \u03c1\u22121 ) is a genus \u2265 0 system of a transitive\nsubgroup of G, we obtain it must be a genus 0 system, and ind(\u03c1) = n \u2212 1.\nThus \u03c1 is an n\u2013cycle. Inductively, we see that \u03bb := \u03c31 \u03c41 . . . \u03c4m\u22122 is a product\nof an (n\u2212d)\u2013cycle and a d\u2013cycle, and that these two cycles are fused by \u03c4m\u22121 .\nNow, by induction on the degree of G, we get that the group generated by the\ntransitive genus 0 system (\u03c31 , \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4m\u22122 , \u03bb\u22121 ) with respect to the support\nof size n\u2212d admits a block system of d blocks being permuted cyclically. Now\nextend each block \u2206 by a single point from the remaining d points as follows:\nj\n\u2212j\nChoose j such that \u03c4m\u22121 moves a point \u03c9 from \u2206\u03c31 . Now append \u03c9 \u03c4m\u22121 \u03c31\nto \u2206. One verifies that this process is well\u2013defined, and gives a block system\nfor (\u03c31 , \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4m\u22121 ) with d blocks being permuted cyclically. It remains to\n\u2032\nshow that this block system is preserved also by (\u03c32\u2032 , \u03c41\u2032 , . . . , \u03c4m\u22121\n). At any\n58\n\n\frate, by symmetry we get a block system for this tuple too, with d blocks\nbeing permuted cyclically. The point is that the product of the elements in\nthis tuple is the same n\u2013cycle as the product of the elements in the former\ntuple, and an n\u2013cycle has a unique block system with d blocks. Therefore\nthe block systems are the same, so are respected by G.\n\n4.4\n\nThe Siegel-Lang Theorem and Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem\n\nLet k be field which is finitely generated over Q, and R a finitely generated\nsubring. The Siegel-Lang Theorem about points with coordinates in R on\nalgebraic curves over k has the following application to Hilbert's irreducibility\ntheorem, see [42, 2.1]:\nLet f (t, X) \u2208 k(t)[X] be irreducible, and Redf (R) the set of those t\u0304 \u2208 R,\nsuch that f (t\u0304, X) is defined, and reducible over k. Then, up to a finitely many\nelements, Redf (R) is the union of finitely many sets of the form g(k) \u2229 R,\nwhere g(Z) \u2208 k(Z) is a rational function.\nIn view of this result, it is important to know which rational functions\ng(Z) have the property that g(k) \u2229 R is an infinite set. By another theorem\nof Siegel-Lang (see [31, 8.5.1]), this property implies that there are at most\ntwo elements of k\u0304 \u222a {\u221e} in the fiber g \u22121(\u221e).\nThe converse is true if we allow to enlarge R. More precisely, we have the\nfollowing\nLemma 4.3. Let k be a finitely generated extension of k, g(Z) \u2208 k(Z) a\nnon-constant rational function such that the fiber g \u22121(\u221e) has at most two\nelements. Then there is a finitely generated subring R of k with |g(k) \u2229 R| =\n\u221e.\nProof. A linear fractional change of the argument of g allows to assume that\ng(Z) has the following shape: There is m \u2265 0 and a polynomial A(Z) \u2208 k[Z],\nsuch that either g(Z) = A(Z)/Z m , or g(Z) = A(Z)/(Z 2 \u2212 d)m , where d \u2208 k\nis not a square. In the first case let R be the ring generated by 1/2 and the\ncoefficients of A(Z), then g(z) \u2208 R if z = 2r for r \u2208 Z, hence g(k) \u2229 R is an\ninfinite set.\nThe second case is a little more\nFor \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 k, define sequences\n\u221a subtle: \u221a\n\u03b1n , \u03b2n \u2208 k for n \u2208 N by \u03b1n + \u03b2n d = (\u03b1 + \u03b2 d)n . Suppose for the moment\nthat \u03b2n 6= 0 for all n. Define zn = \u03b1n /\u03b2n . Then\u221athe zn are pairwise distinct,\n\u221a\nfor if zj = zi for j > i, then \u03b2j /\u03b2i = (\u03b1 + \u03b2 d)j\u2212i = \u03b1j\u2212i + \u03b2j\u2212i d, so\n\u03b2j\u2212i = 0, a contradiction. Let R be the ring generated by the coefficients of\nA(Z) and 1/(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b2 2 d). Note that (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b2 2 d)n = \u03b1n2 \u2212 \u03b2n2 d, so g(zn ) \u2208 R for\nall n.\n59\n\n\fIt \u221a\nremains to show that we can choose suitable \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 k. Write \u03b3 =\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 d. Then \u03b2n = 0 is equivalent to \u03b3 n \u2208 k. Thus we have to find \u03b3\nn\nsuch \u03b3 n 6\u2208 k for all n \u2208 N. Suppose that\n\u221a \u03b3 6\u2208 k, however \u03b3 \u2208 k. Let\n\u03c3 be the involutory automorphism of k( d)/k. The minimal polynomial\nn\nn\n(X \u2212 \u03b3)(X \u2212 \u03c3(\u03b3)) of \u03b3 over k divides\n, so \u03c3(\u03b3) = \u03b6\u03b3 for \u03b6 an nth\n\u221a X \u2212\u03b3\u221a\nroot of unity. In particular, \u03b6 \u2208 k( d). But k( d) is finitely generated,\n\u221a so\nthis field contains only finitely many roots of unity. For a fixed \u03b3 \u2208 k( d) \\ k\nconsider the elements \u03b3 + i, for i \u2208 Z. For each i there is ni \u2208 N with\n(\u03b3 + i)ni \u2208 k. By the above, each element (\u03c3(\u03b3) + i)/(\u03b3 + i) is a root of unity.\nOne of these roots of unity appears for infinitely many i, which of course is\nnonsense.\nIf k = Q, then one is mainly interested in the special case R = Z. Then\n|g(Q) \u2229 Z| = \u221e has another strong consequence, see [50]: If |g \u22121(\u221e)| = 2,\nthen the two elements in g \u22121(\u221e) are real and algebraically conjugate.\nMotivated by these results, we make the following\nDefinition 4.4. Let k be a field which is finitely generated over Q, and\ng(Z) \u2208 k(Z) a non-constant rational function. We say that g(Z) is a Siegel\nfunction over k, if there is a finitely generated subring R of k with |g(k)\u2229R| =\n\u221e. If k = Q, then we require more strongly that |g(Q) \u2229 Z| = \u221e.\nIn the analysis of Siegel functions we will make use of the fact about\ng (\u221e). For this it will not be necessary to assume that k is finitely generated. Thus we define a more general property, which holds for Siegel functions.\n\u22121\n\nDefinition 4.5. Let k be a field of characteristic 0, and g(Z) \u2208 k(Z) a nonconstant rational function. We say that g(Z) fulfills the Siegel property, if\n|g \u22121 (\u221e)| \u2264 2.\nIf k = Q, and |g \u22121(\u221e)| = 2, then we additionally require the two elements\nin g \u22121 (\u221e) to be real and algebraically conjugate.\n\n4.5\n\nSiegel Functions and Ramification at Infinity\n\nTo ease the language, we start to define monodromy groups of rational functions.\nDefinition 4.6. Let k be a field of characteristic 0, and g(Z) \u2208 k(Z) be a\nnon-constant rational function. Denote by L a splitting field of g(Z) \u2212 t over\nk(t). Set A = Gal(L/k(t)), considered as a permutation group on the roots\nof g(Z) \u2212 t. Denote by k\u0302 the algebraic closure of k in L, and let G E A be\nthe normal subgroup Gal(L/k\u0302(t)). Then A and G are called the arithmetic\n60\n\n\fmonodromy group and geometric monodromy group of g(Z), respectively.\nNote that A/G is naturally isomorphic to Gal(k\u0302/k).\nOur goal is to determine the genus 0 systems and the monodromy groups\nof functionally indecomposable rational functions with the Siegel property.\nL\u00fcroth's Theorem shows that functional indecomposability of g(Z) (over k)\nimplies primitivity of A. The following lemma summarizes the properties we\nwill use.\nLemma 4.7. With the notation from above let D \u2264 A and I E D be the\ndecomposition and inertia group of a place of L lying above the place t 7\u2192 \u221e\nof k(t), respectively. Suppose that g(Z) has the Siegel property. Then the\nfollowing holds.\n(a) The cyclic group I has at most two orbits, with lengths equal the multiplicities of the elements in g \u22121(\u221e).\n(b) A = GD and I \u2264 G \u2229 D. In particular, A = NA (I)G.\n(c) If A is primitive, then G is primitive, too.\n(d) G has a genus 0 system, with a generator of I belonging to it.\nProof. For (a) and (b) see [42, Lemma 3.4], for (c) see [42, Theorem 3.5],\nand (d) follows from Section 4.1.\n\n4.6\n\nMonodromy Groups and Ramification of Siegel Functions\n\nThe main result of this section is\nTheorem 4.8.

Functional indecomposability of g(Z) implies that\nA is primitive. By Lemma 4.7(a) we can apply Theorem 3.3. It remains to\nfind normal subgroups G of A for which (b) and (d) of Lemma 4.7 hold. For\nthat it is useful to know that G is primitive as well by Lemma 4.7(c).\nThe proof is split up into three sections, according to whether A acts as\nan affine group, preserves a product structure, or is almost simple.\n63\n\n\f4.7.1\n\nAffine Action\n\nThe proof is based on work by Guralnick, Neubauer, and Thompson on genus\n0 systems in primitive permutation groups of affine type.\nSuppose that A is affine. The cases that A has degree \u2264 4 are immediate,\nso assume n \u2265 5.\nG is primitive by Lemma 4.7. Let \u03c3r be a generator of I, so \u03c3r has two\ncycles.\nLet N be the minimal normal subgroup of A. First suppose that G\u2032\u2032 = 1.\nAs G\u2032 is abelian, we have G\u2032 = N, and primitivity of G forces that G/N acts\nirreducibly on N. But G/N = G/G\u2032 is abelian, so G/N is cyclic by Schur's\nLemma. More precisely, we can identify G as a subgroup of AGL1 (q), where\nq = |N| = pm for a prime p. As q > 4, we have necessarily that \u03c3 fixes a point\nand moves the remaining ones in a (q \u2212 1)\u2013cycle. An element in N has index\nq(1 \u2212 1/p) \u2265 q/2, whereas an element in AGL1 (q) of order t|q \u2212 1 has index\n(q \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 1/t) \u2265 (q \u2212 1)/2. The index relation gives r = 3 and that neither\n\u03c31 nor \u03c32 is contained in N. So 2(q \u22121) = q \u22122+(q \u22121)(1\u22121/t1 +1\u22121/t2 ) \u2265\nq \u2212 2 + (q \u2212 1)(1/2 + 2/3), where ti is the order of \u03c3i . It follows q \u2264 7.\nNext suppose that G\u2032\u2032 > 1. Write n = pm . We use [17, Theorems 4.1,\n5.1]. If p > 5, then p = 7 or 11, and m = 2. Furthermore T = (2, 4, 6)\nfor p = 7, or T = (2, 3, 8) for p = 11. So this does not occur in view of\nord(\u03c3r ) \u2265 n/2 = p2 /2. Next suppose p = 5. We use [44, Theorem 1.5]\n(the statement is already in [17], but only parts are proven there). Again\ncompare ord(\u03c3r ) \u2265 n/2 with the possible genus 0 systems given for p = 5.\nOnly n = 25 with G = (C5 \u00d7 C5 ) \u22ca (SL2 (5) \u22ca C2 ) could arise. However, this\ngroup does not have an element with only two cycles by Theorem 3.3.\nSo we have p = 3 or 2. Suppose that p = 3. Use [44, Theorem 1.5] to\nsee that necessarily n = 9. Check directly that only the listed degree 9 cases\noccur.\nNow suppose p = 2. By [16], we automatically get n \u2264 64. The cases\nfor n \u2264 16 are small enough to be checked with GAP [46]. If n = 32 then\nG = A = AGL5 (2) or n = 64 and G = A = AGL6 (2), GL3 (4) \u2264 G \u2264 A \u2264\n\u0393L3 (4), or GL2 (8) \u2264 G \u2264 A \u2264 \u0393L2 (8) by Theorem 3.3. The last two cases\nare quickly ruled out with GAP. We did not check for genus 0 systems in the\nformer two cases, but we believe that they exist.\n4.7.2\n\nProduct Action\n\nLet A be a non-affine group which preserves a product structure. Again let\n\u03c3r be the element with two cycles.\nBy Theorem 3.3, we have have A = (U \u00d7 U) \u22ca C2 in product action,\n64\n\n\fwhere either U = S m , or U = PGL2 (p) for a prime p \u2265 5. By primitivity\nof G we cannot have G \u2264 (U \u00d7 U). On the other hand, the presence of \u03c3r\nforces U \u00d7 U \u2264 G, see the proof of Theorem 3.3, so G = A.\nLet \u2206 be the set U is acting on, and let \u03a9 := \u2206 \u00d7 \u2206 be the set G = A\nacts on.\nWe show the existence of a genus 0 system of the required form for U =\nS m . Write \u2206 := {1, 2, . . . , m}. Let \u03c4 \u2208 G be the element which maps (i, j)\nto (j, i). Let 1 \u2264 a < m be prime to m. For \u03b1 := (1, 2, . . . , m) \u2208 S m and\n\u03b2 := (a, a \u2212 1, . . . , 2, 1)(m, m \u2212 1, . . . , a + 2, a + 1) \u2208 S m set \u03c31 := (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 A,\n\u03c32 := \u03c4 , \u03c33 := (\u03c31 \u03c32 )\u22121 . We show that (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 ) is a genus 0 system of G.\nFirst we show that \u03c31 and \u03c32 generate G. Note that a, m \u2212 a, and m are\npairwise prime. Let r and s be integers such that rm \u2261 1 (mod a(m\u2212a)) and\nsa(m\u2212a)\nsa(m \u2212 a) \u2261 1 (mod m). Then clearly \u03c31rm = (1, \u03b2) and \u03c31\n= (\u03b1, 1).\nConjugating with \u03c4 shows that also (\u03b2, 1), (1, \u03b1) \u2208 G. We are done once\nwe know that \u03b1, \u03b2 generate S m . But this is clear, because it is easy to see\nthat the generated group is doubly transitive and contains the transposition\n\u03b1\u03b2 = (a, m).\nWe compute the index of \u03c3i . The element \u03c31 has a cycle of length ma,\nand another one of length m(m \u2212 a). So ind(\u03c31 ) = m2 \u2212 2. Furthermore,\nind(\u03c32 ) = (m2 \u2212 m)/2, because \u03c32 = \u03c4 has exactly m fixed points, and\nswitches the remaining points in cycles of length 2. Next, \u03c33 := \u03c4 (\u03b1\u22121 , \u03b2 \u22121).\nThe element (i, j) \u2208 \u03a9 is a fixed point of \u03c33 if and only if j = i\u03b1 and i = j \u03b2 ,\nhence j = i + 1 with i 6= a, m. Thus there are exactly m \u2212 2 fixed points.\nNow \u03c332 = ((a, m), (a + 1, 1)) has order 2 and exactly (m \u2212 2)2 fixed points.\nLemma 4.1 gives\n1\nind(\u03c33 ) = m2 \u2212 (\u03c6(4)(m \u2212 2) + \u03c6(2)(m \u2212 2)2 + \u03c6(1)m2 )\n4\n2\n= (m + m)/2,\nso the genus of (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 ) is 0.\nWe now show that U = PGL2 (p) does not occur. Again, let \u03c4 be the element which flips the entries of \u03a9. At least two of the elements in \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3r\u22121\nmust be of the form \u03c3 = (\u03b1, \u03b2)\u03c4 , with \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 PGL2 (p). This \u03c3 is conjugate\nin G to (1, \u03b1\u03b2)\u03c4 . If \u03b1\u03b2 = 1, then ind(\u03c3) = ((p + 1)2 \u2212 (p + 1))/2. Otherwise,\nind(\u03c3) \u2265 2((p + 1)2 \u2212 4)/3, because \u03c3 2 \u223c (\u03b1\u03b2, \u03b1\u03b2) has at most 4 fixed points.\nIf \u03c3 has the form (\u03b1, \u03b2), then \u03c3 has at most 4(p + 1) fixed points, so\nind(\u03c3) P\n\u2265 ((p + 1)2 \u2212 4(p + 1))/2.\nr\u22121\nind(\u03c3i ) = (p+1)2 , it follows from these index bounds that r = 3,\nAs i=1\nso \u03c31 and \u03c32 have the \u03c4 \u2013part. Because not both \u03c31 and \u03c32 can be involutions\n(for G is not dihedral), we obtain (p + 1)2 \u2265 ((p + 1)2 \u2212 (p + 1))/2 + 2((p +\n1)2 \u2212 4)/3, so p < 5, a contradiction.\n65\n\n\f4.7.3\n\nAlmost Simple Action\n\nLet S be the simple non-anabelian group with S \u2264 G \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S), and \u03c3r\nagain the element with two cycles. We have to check the groups in Theorem\n3.3(III) for the existence of genus 0 systems of the required form.\nIf S = An (n even) in natural action, then it is easy to check that there\nare many such genus 0 systems, and it is obviously not possible to give a\nreasonable classification of them.\nNext, the cases except the infinite series 3c and 3d of Theorem 3.3 are\neasily dealt with, using the atlas [7] and some ad hoc arguments, or more\nconveniently using [46].\nNow assume PSL2 (q) \u2264 G \u2264 P\u0393L2 (q) in the natural action, with q \u2265 5\na prime power. Note that q is odd. As n = q + 1 and ind(\u03c3r ) = n \u2212 2, the\nindex relation gives\nq+1=\n\nr\u22121\nX\n\nind(\u03c3k ).\n\nk=1\n\nWe distinguish two cases.\nFirst assume G \u2264 PGL2 (q). For \u03c3 \u2208 PGL2 (q) we easily obtain (see e. g.\n[39]) that ind(\u03c3) \u2265 (q \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3)). So the index relation gives\nr\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\n(1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3k )) \u2264\n\nq+1\n.\nq\u22121\n\nAs G is not dihedral, either r \u2265 4, or r = 3 and \u03c31 and \u03c32 are not both\ninvolutions.\nIn the first case, we obtain q = 5, and in the second case,\nP2\n(1\n\u2212\n1/ord(\u03c3\nk )) \u2265 (1 \u2212 1/2) + (1 \u2212 1/3) gives q \u2264 13. Check these cases\nk=1\ndirectly.\nNext suppose that G 6\u2264 PGL2 (q), but G \u2264 P\u0393L2 (q). Check the case\nq = 9, \u03c3r 6\u2208 PGL2 (9) directly and exclude it in the following. Thus \u03c3r \u2208\nPGL2 (q) by Lemma 3.48. Denote by \u03c3\u0304k the image of \u03c3k in the abelian\ngroup P\u0393L2 (q)/ PGL2 (q). Then the elements \u03c3\u0304k for k = 1, . . . , r \u2212 1 are\nnot all trivial and have product 1. Thus the order of two of the elements\n\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r\u22121 have a common divisor \u2265 2. Furthermore, for \u03c3 \u2208 P\u0393L2 (q),\n\u221a\nwe have the index bound ind(\u03c3) \u2265 (1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3))(q \u2212 q), see [39]. This\n\n66\n\n\finformation, combined with the index relation, gives\n5\n1\n1\n= (1 \u2212 ) + (1 \u2212 )\n4\n2\n4\nr\u22121\nX\n\u2264\n(1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3k ))\nk=1\n\nr\u22121\nX\n1\n\u2264\nind(\u03c3k )\n\u221a\nq \u2212 q k=1\n\n=\n\nq+1\n\u221a .\nq\u2212 q\n\n\u221a\nHence q \u2264 5 q + 4, so q = 9, 25, or 27. If q = 27 = 33 , then the above\nargument shows that the common divisor can \u221a\nbe chosen to be 3, so the\nanalogous calculation gives 4/3 \u2264 (27 + 1)/(27 \u2212 27), which does not hold.\nSimilarly, refine the argument (using [39]) or simply check with GAP [46]\nthat q = 25 does not occur.\nThe main case which is left to investigate is case III(d) of Theorem 3.3,\nnamely that PSLm (q) \u2264 G \u2264 P\u0393Lm (q) acts naturally on the projective space,\nq is an odd prime power, m \u2265 2 is even, and \u03c3r is the square of a Singer\ncycle. The case m = 2 has been done above. The case m \u2265 4, which is\nsomewhat involved, will be handled in the remaining part of this section. In\norder to finish the almost simple case, we need to show that m = 4, q = 3,\ngiving the degree n = 40 cases in Theorem 4.8.\nFor this we need the following index bounds.\nLemma 4.10. Let q be a prime power, and 1 6= \u03c3 \u2208 P\u0393Lm (q), where m \u2265 4.\nThen the following holds:\n1. ind(\u03c3) \u2265 (1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3))(q m\u22121 \u2212 1).\n2. If ord(\u03c3) is a prime not dividing q(q \u2212 1), and \u03c3 \u2208 PGLm (q), then\nind(\u03c3) \u2265 (1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3))q m\u22122 (q + 1).\n3. If ord(\u03c3) is a prime dividing q, and \u03c3 \u2208 PGLm (q), then ind(\u03c3) =\n(1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3))(q m \u2212 q j )/(q \u2212 1) for some 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m \u2212 1.\nProof. For 1 see [39].\nSet N := (q m \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1), and let s be the order of \u03c3.\nNow assume the hypothesis in 2. Let \u03c7(\u03c3) be the number of fixed points\nof \u03c3. Then clearly ind(\u03c3) = (N \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3))(1 \u2212 1/s). Let \u03c3\u0302 \u2208 GLm (q) be a\n\n67\n\n\fpreimage of \u03c3 of order s. For \u03b1 \u2208 Fq , let d(\u03b1) be the dimension of the\neigenspace of \u03c3\u0302 with eigenvalue \u03b1. Clearly\n\u03c7(\u03c3) =\n\nX q d(\u03b1) \u2212 1\n.\nq\u22121\n\u03b1\u2208F\nq\n\nP\nSo \u03c7(\u03c3) \u2264 (q d \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1), where d = \u03b1 d(\u03b1). On the other hand, as s\ndoes not divide q \u2212 1, \u03c3\u0302 must have eigenvalues not in Fq . So d \u2264 m \u2212 2, and\nthe claim follows.\nTo prove 3, note that a preimage of order s of \u03c3 in GLm (q) admits Jordan\nnormal form over Fq .\nRecall that N = (q m \u2212 1)/(q \u2212 1). Note that ind(\u03c3r ) = N \u2212 2, so the\nindex relation gives\nr\u22121\nX\n\nind(\u03c3k ) = N.\n\n(17)\n\nk=1\n\nClaim 4.11. r = 3.\nProof. Suppose that r \u2265 4. From 1 in Lemma 4.10 we have ind(\u03c3k ) \u2265\n(1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3k ))(q m\u22121 \u2212 1), hence\nr\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\n(1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3k )) \u2264\n\nN\nq m\u22121 \u2212 1\n\n1\n1\n+ m\u22121\nq\u22121 q\n\u22121\n1\n1\n+ 3\n\u22641+\nq\u22121 q \u22121\n2\n.\n<1+\nq\u22121\n=1+\n\n(18)\n\n2\nFirst note that if r \u2265 4, then 3/2 < 1+ q\u22121\n, so q < 5 and hence q = 3. We\nPr\u22121\nget more precisely k=1 (1 \u2212 1/ord(\u03c3k )) \u2264 1 + 1/(3 \u2212 1) + 1/(27 \u2212 1) = 20/13.\nHowever, 2(1 \u2212 1/2) + (1 \u2212 1/3) = 5/3 > 20/13, so besides q = 3 we obtain\nr = 4, and \u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 are involutions. Note that \u03c34 has cycles of even length,\nas 4|N. So these involutions do have fixed points by Lemma 4.2. Let \u03c3\u0302 be\na preimage in GLm (3) of an involution in PGLm (3) with fixed points. Thus\n\u03c3\u0302 2 has eigenvalue 1 on the one hand, but is also scalar. So \u03c3\u0302 has only the\n\n68\n\n\feigenvalues 1 and \u22121, and both eigenvalues occur. This shows \u03c7(\u03c3) \u2261 2\n(mod 3), hence ind(\u03c3) \u2261 (N \u2212 2)/2 \u2261 1 (mod 3). So\n1\u2261N =\n\n3\nX\nk=1\n\nind(\u03c3k ) \u2261 0\n\n(mod 3),\n\na contradiction.\nClaim 4.12. q \u2264 7.\nProof. From (18) and r = 3 we obtain\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\n\u22651\u2212\n\u2212 m\u22121\n\u22651\u2212\n\u2212 3\n.\nord(\u03c31 ) ord(\u03c32 )\nq\u22121 q\n\u22121\nq\u22121 q \u22121\n\n(19)\n\n\u03c31 and \u03c32 are not both involutions (because G is not dihedral). This gives\n1/2 + 1/3 \u2265 1 \u2212 1/(q \u2212 1) \u2212 1/(q 3 \u2212 1), so q < 8.\nIn the following we assume ord(\u03c31 ) \u2264 ord(\u03c32 ).\nClaim 4.13. q 6= 7.\nProof. Suppose q = 7. From (18) we obtain 1/ord(\u03c31 ) + 1/ord(\u03c32 ) \u2265 1 \u2212\n1/6 \u2212 1/(73 \u2212 1) > 3/4, hence ord(\u03c31 ) = 2, ord(\u03c32 ) = 3. Again, as 2|(N/2) =\nord(\u03c33 ), we get that \u03c31 has fixed points, and so \u03c7(\u03c31 ) \u2261 2 (mod 7), hence\nind(\u03c31 ) \u2261 3 (mod 7). From 3 + 2(N \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c32 ))/3 = 3 + ind(\u03c32 ) \u2261 N \u2261 1\n(mod 7) it follows that \u03c7(\u03c32 ) \u2261 4 (mod 7). So a preimage \u03c3\u03022 \u2208 GLm (7) of\n\u03c32 has exactly 4 different eigenvalues \u03bb in F7 . Let \u03c3\u030223 be the scalar \u03c1. The\nequation X 3 \u2212 \u03c1 has at most 3 roots in F7 , a contradiction.\nClaim 4.14. q 6= 5.\nProof. Suppose q = 5. The proof is similar to the argument in the previous\nclaim, so we only describe the steps which differ from there. We obtain\nord(\u03c31 ) = 2 and ord(\u03c32 ) = 3 or 4.\nFirst assume that ord(\u03c32 ) = 3. As 3|N, we obtain that \u03c32 has fixed points\nby Lemma 4.2, so a preimage \u03c3\u02c62 \u2208 GLm (5) has eigenvalues in F5 . Suppose\n(without loss, as gcd(q \u2212 1, 3) = 1) that 1 is one of the eigenvalues. As\n(X 3 \u2212 1)/(X \u2212 1) is irreducible in F5 , this is the only F5 \u2013eigenvalue of \u03c3\u02c62 .\nSo \u03c7(\u03c32 ) \u2261 1 (mod 5), hence ind(\u03c32 ) \u2261 0 (mod 5). This gives \u03c7(\u03c31 ) \u2261 4\n(mod 5), which is clearly not possible.\n\n69\n\n\fNow assume that ord(\u03c32 ) = 4. The index relation together with Lemma\n4.1 gives\n2\u03c7(\u03c31 ) + 2\u03c7(\u03c32 ) + \u03c7(\u03c322 ) = N.\n\n(20)\n\nClearly, \u03c7(\u03c322 ) \u2265 \u03c7(\u03c32 ). If \u03c7(\u03c322 ) = 0, then \u03c7(\u03c31 ) \u2261 3 (mod 5), which is not\npossible. Thus \u03c322 has fixed points.\nFirst assume that \u03c32 has no fixed points. Then \u03c31 has fixed points by\nLemma 4.2, so \u03c7(\u03c31 ) \u2261 2 (mod 5). From that we obtain\n2((5a \u2212 1) + (5m\u2212a \u2212 1)) + ((5b \u2212 1) + (5m\u2212b \u2212 1)) = 5m \u2212 1\nfor suitable 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 m \u2212 1. However, 5a + 5m\u2212a \u2264 5 + 5m\u22121 , and similarly\nfor b, so 3(5 + 5m\u22121 ) \u2265 5(5m\u22121 + 1). This gives 5m\u22121 \u2264 5, a contradiction.\nSo \u03c32 has fixed points as well, therefore all eigenvalues of a preimage\n\u03c3\u02c62 \u2208 GLm (5) are in F5 . Without loss assume that 1 is an eigenvalue of \u03c3\u02c62 ,\nand denote by a, b, c, d the multiplicity of the the eigenvalue 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2208 F5 ,\nrespectively. Clearly b + c > 0, as \u03c3\u02c62 has order 4. Also, a > 0 by our choice.\nWe obtain that \u03c7(\u03c322 ) = (5a+d \u22121)/4+(5b+c \u22121)/4, hence \u03c7(\u03c322 ) \u2261 2 (mod 5).\nRelation (20) gives \u03c7(\u03c31 ) + \u03c7(\u03c32 ) \u2261 2 (mod 5). If \u03c31 has fixed points, then\n\u03c7(\u03c31 ) \u2261 2 (mod 5), hence \u03c7(\u03c32 ) \u2261 0 (mod 5), which is not the case. Thus\n\u03c7(\u03c31 ) = 0 and \u03c7(\u03c32 ) \u2261 2 (mod 5), so d = 0 and either b = 0 or c = 0.\nSuppose without loss c = 0. Hence \u03c7(\u03c32 ) = \u03c7(\u03c322 ), and we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012 a\n5m \u2212 1\n5 \u2212 1 5m\u2212a \u2212 1\n2\nN=\n,\n= 2\u03c7(\u03c32 ) + \u03c7(\u03c32 ) = 3\u03c7(\u03c32 ) = 3\n+\n4\n4\n4\nso\n5m + 5 = 3(5a + 5m\u2212a ) \u2264 3(5 + 5m\u22121 ),\na contradiction as previously.\nClaim 4.15. If q = 3, then m = 4 and (ord(\u03c31 ), ord(\u03c32 )) = (2, 3) or (2, 4).\nProof. As ind(\u03c3k ) \u2265 (3m\u22121 \u2212 1)/2, and ind(\u03c3k ) \u2265 2(3m\u22122 \u2212 1) unless \u03c3k is an\ninvolution in PGLm (3) of minimal possible index, we obtain from the index\nrelation (17) that\n(\n3m\u22121 in any case,\nind(\u03c3k ) \u2264 5*3m\u22122 +3\nfor k = 2 if \u03c31 has not minimal possible index.\n2\n(21)\n70\n\n\fWe first note that no prime s \u2265 5 does divide ord(\u03c3k ), for (21) and Lemma\n4.102 would give\n1\n(1 \u2212 )3m\u22122 4 \u2264 ind(\u03c3k ) \u2264 3m\u22121 ,\n5\nwhich is nonsense.\nSimilarly, we see that 9 does not divide ord(\u03c3k ). Let \u03c3 \u2208 PGLm (3) have\norder 9, and let \u03c3\u0302 \u2208 GLm (3) be a preimage of order 9. So \u03c3\u0302 admits Jordan\nnormal form over F3 , and there must be at least one Jordan block of size \u2265 4\nby Lemma 3.5. Thus \u03c7(\u03c3) \u2264 (3m\u22123 \u2212 1)/2, and also \u03c7(\u03c3 3 ) \u2264 (3m\u22121 \u2212 1)/2.\nNow\n1\n2\n2\nind(\u03c3) = (1 \u2212 )N \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3 3 )\n9\n3\n9\nby Lemma 4.1. Use the above estimation to obtain after some calculation\nthat ind(\u03c3) \u2265 32 * 3m\u22124 > 3m\u22121 , contrary to (21).\nNow suppose that 4 divides the order of \u03c3k . Let \u03c3 be a power of \u03c3k\nof order 4. As \u03c3k must have a cycle of odd length by Lemma 4.2, \u03c3 must\nhave a fixed point. Thus there is a preimage \u03c3\u0302 \u2208 GLm (3) of \u03c3 with \u03c3\u0302 4 = 1.\nLet a and b be the number of Jordan blocks of size 1 with eigenvalue 1\nand \u22121, respectively, and let j be the number of square blocks of size 2.\nThe square of such a block matrix is a scalar with eigenvalue \u22121. We have\na + b + 2j = m, and 2 \u2264 a + b \u2264 m \u2212 2. Also, \u03c7(\u03c3) = (3a \u2212 1 + 3b \u2212 1)/2 and\n\u03c7(\u03c3 2 ) = (3a+b \u2212 1 + 32j \u2212 1)/2. From that we obtain\n3\n1\n1\nind(\u03c3) = N \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3 2 )\n4\n2\n4\n3\n3a + 3b \u2212 2 3a+b + 3m\u2212a\u2212b \u2212 2\n= N\u2212\n\u2212\n4\n4\n8\nm\u22122\nm\u22122\n3\n\u22121 3\n+7\n3\n\u2212\n\u2265 N\u2212\n4\n4\n8\n= 3m\u22121 \u2212 1.\nNote that ind(\u03c3k ) \u2265 ind(\u03c3). From that we see that k = 2, and by (21) it\nfollows that \u03c31 is an involution with minimal possible index. Thus ind(\u03c32 ) =\n3m\u22121 again by (21). This shows that ord(\u03c32 ) is not divisible by 3, because\nthen a cycle of \u03c32 of length divisible by 3 would break up into at least 3\ncycles of \u03c3, so ind(\u03c32 ) \u2265 2 + ind(\u03c3) \u2265 1 + 3m\u22121 , a contradiction to (21).\nSimilarly, we see that 8 does not divide ord(\u03c32 ). Suppose otherwise. Then\nwe get the same contradiction unless ord(\u03c32 ) = 8 and \u03c32 has exactly 1 cycle of\nlength 8. But then \u03c324 has N \u2212 8 fixed points, however \u03c7(\u03c324 ) \u2264 (3m\u22121 + 1)/2,\nso (3m \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 8 \u2264 (3m\u22121 + 1)/2, so 3m\u22121 \u2264 9, a contradiction.\n71\n\n\fSo ord(\u03c32 ) = 4, and ind(\u03c32 ) = 3m\u22121 by what we have seen so far. Express\nind(\u03c32 ) in terms of a and b as above. As \u03c3\u03021 fixes a hyperplane pointwise, and\n<\u03c3\u03021 , \u03c3\u03022 > is irreducible, we infer that a, b \u2264 1. Also, a + b > 0, so a = b = 1\nbecause a + b is even. Substitute a = b = 1 in the relation ind(\u03c32 ) = 3m\u22121\nto get 3m\u22121 = 27, so m = 4. This case indeed occurs.\nNext we look at elements of order 6. Let \u03c3 \u2208 PGLm (3) have order 6, and\n\u03c3\u0302 \u2208 GLm (3) be a preimage. We have\n5\n1\n1\n1\nind(\u03c3) = N \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3 2 ) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3 3 ).\n6\n3\n3\n6\nClearly\n\u03c7(\u03c3 2 ) \u2264\n\n3m\u22121 \u2212 1\n2\n\n\u03c7(\u03c3 3 ) \u2264\n\n3m\u22121 + 1\n.\n2\n\nand\n\nIf \u03c3 has no fixed points, then \u03c3\u0302 6 = \u22121, and therefore \u03c3 3 has no fixed points\nas well. In this case, we thus obtain ind(\u03c3) \u2265 5N/6 \u2212 \u03c7(\u03c3 2 )/3 \u2265 (13 * 3m\u22121 \u2212\n3)/12 > 3m\u22121 . This, in conjunction with (21), shows that if ord(\u03c3k ) = 6,\nthen \u03c3k has a fixed point. Suppose that \u03c3 = \u03c3k has order 6 and a fixed point.\nThen \u03c3\u0302 admits Jordan normal form over F3 , and one realizes easily that\n\u03c7(\u03c3) \u2264\n\n3m\u22122 + 1\n3m\u22122 \u2212 1 + 31 \u2212 1\n=\n.\n2\n2\n\nUsing this, one obtains after some calculation\nind(\u03c3) \u2265\n\n17 * 3m\u22121 \u2212 9\n.\n18\n\nHowever, (17 * 3m\u22121 \u2212 9)/18 > (5 * 3m\u22122 + 3)/2, so we get from (21) that k = 2\nand \u03c31 is an involution with minimal index. So ind(\u03c32 ) = 3m\u22121 by (17), and\n\u03c31 leaves a hyperplane invariant. The irreducibility of <\u03c31 , \u03c32 > forces that\n\u03c3\u03022 has eigenspaces of dimension at most 1. On the other hand, the Jordan\nblocks of \u03c3\u03022 have size at most 3. As m \u2265 4, there is thus exactly one Jordan\nblock with eigenvalue 1, and exactly one with eigenvalue \u22121. Let u and m\u2212u\nbe the size of these blocks, respectively. Clearly \u03c7(\u03c32 ) = 2, \u03c7(\u03c322 ) = 4, and\n\u03c7(\u03c323 ) = (3u + 3m\u2212u \u2212 2)/2. From that one computes\n5 * 3m \u2212 3u \u2212 3m\u2212u \u2212 27\nind(\u03c32 ) =\n.\n12\n72\n\n\fNow ind(\u03c32 ) = 3m\u22121 yields the equation 3m = 3u + 3m\u2212u + 27, which gives\n3m\u2212u = (3u + 27)/(3u \u2212 1). Check that the right hand side is never a power\nof 3 for u = 1, 2, 3.\nIt remains to look at ord(\u03c32 ) = 3. Then ord(\u03c31 ) = 2 or 3. Note that\nind(\u03c32 ) = 3m\u22121 \u2212 3j2\u22121 by Lemma 4.103, where j2 is the number of Jordan\nblocks. Suppose that ord(\u03c31 ) = 3, and let j1 be the number of Jordan blocks.\nThe index relation yields 3m\u22121 +1 = 2(3j1 \u22121 +3j2 \u22121 ). Looking modulo 3 shows\nthat j1 = j2 = 1. But this gives m = 2, a contradiction.\nFinally, suppose ord(\u03c31 ) = 2. As the cycles of \u03c33 are divisible by 2,\nLemma 4.2 shows that \u03c31 has fixed points. Then ind(\u03c31 ) = (3m \u2212 3i \u2212 3m\u2212i +\n1)/4, where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 1 is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1 of an\ninvolutory preimage of \u03c31 in GLm (3). The index relation yields\n3m\u22121 = 3i + 3m\u2212i + 4 * 3j2 \u22121 \u2212 3.\nIf i = 1 or m \u2212 1, then the right hand side is bigger than the left hand side.\nThus 2 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 2. Looking modulo 9 then shows that j2 = 2, so we get\n3m\u22121 = 3i + 3m\u2212i + 9. Looking modulo 27 reveals that 3i = 3m\u2212i = 9, thus\nm = 4. This occurs indeed.\n\n5\n\nSiegel Functions over the Rationals\n\n5.1\n\nMonodromy Groups and Ramification\n\nThe main arithmetic constraint on monodromy groups is given in the following lemma, see [42, Lemma 3.4]:\nLemma 5.1. Let g(Z) \u2208 Q(Z) be a rational function of degree n = 2m \u2265\n2, such that g \u22121\n\u221a(\u221e) consists of two real elements, which are algebraically\nconjugate in Q( d), for d > 1 a square-free integer. Let t be a transcendental\nover Q, and L a splitting field of g(Z) \u2212 t over Q(t).\nLet D \u2264 A and I E D be the decomposition and inertia group of a place\nof L lying above the place t 7\u2192 \u221e of Q(t), respectively.\nThen I = <\u03c3> for some \u03c3 \u2208 G, and the following holds.\n1. \u03c3 is a product of two m\u2013cycles.\n2. \u03c3 k is conjugate in D to \u03c3 for all k prime to m.\n3. D contains an element which switches the two orbits of I.\n4. D contains an involution \u03c4 , such that \u03c3 \u03c4 = \u03c3 \u22121 , and \u03c4 fixes the orbits\nof I setwise.\n73\n\n\f\u221a\n5. If d 6\u2208 Q(\u03b6m ) (with \u03b6m a primitive m\u2013th root of unity), then the\ncentralizer CD (I) contains an element which interchanges the two orbits\nof I.\nThe main result about the monodromy groups of Siegel functions over Q\nis.\nTheorem 5.2. Let g(Z) \u2208 Q(Z) be a functionally indecomposable rational\nfunction of degree n \u2265 2 with |g \u22121(\u221e)| = 2. Let A and G be the arithmetic\nand geometric monodromy group of g, respectively. Let T be the ramification\ntype of g. Then one of the following holds:\n1. n is even, An \u2264 G \u2264 A \u2264 S n , many possibilities for T ; or\n2. n = 6, G = PSL2 (5), A = PGL2 (5), T = (2, 5, 3) and (2, 2, 2, 3); or\n3. n = 6, G = PGL2 (5) = A, T = (4, 4, 3); or\n4. n = 8, G = AGL3 (2) = A, T = (2, 2, 3, 4), (2, 2, 4, 4), and (2, 2, 2, 2, 4);\nor\n5. n = 10, S \u2264 G \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S), where S = A5 or A6 , with many\npossibilities for T ; or\n6. n = 16, G = (S4 \u00d7 S4 ) \u22ca C2 = A, T = (2, 6, 8), (2, 2, 2, 8); or\n7. n = 16, G = C24 \u22ca S5 = A, T = (2, 5, 8), (2, 6, 8), and (2, 2, 2, 8).\nThe analogue of the previous theorem for Siegel functions with |g \u22121(\u221e)| =\n1 follows from the classification of the monodromy groups of polynomials. For\ncompleteness, we give the result from [39].\nTheorem 5.3. Let g(Z) \u2208 Q(Z) be a functionally indecomposable rational\nfunction with |g \u22121(\u221e)| = 1 and of degree n \u2265 2. Let A and G be the\narithmetic and geometric monodromy group of g, respectively. Let T be the\nramification type of g. Then one of the following holds:\n1. n is a prime, Cn = G \u2264 A = AGL1 (n), T = (n, n).\n2. n \u2265 3 is a prime, Dn = G \u2264 A = AGL1 (n), T = (2, 2, n).\n3. n \u2265 4, An \u2264 G \u2264 A \u2264 S n , many possibilities for T .\n4. n = 6, G = PGL2 (5) = A, T = (2, 4, 6).\n5. n = 9, G = P\u0393L2 (8) = A, T = (3, 3, 9).\n6. n = 10, G = P\u0393L2 (9) = A, T = (2, 4, 10).\n74\n\n\f5.2\n\nProof of Theorem 5.2\n\nLet E = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r ) be a genus 0 system of G, and T its type, such that\n\u03c3r is the element \u03c3 from Lemma 5.1. So n = 2m, where \u03c3r has two cycles,\nboth of length m.\nWe denote by L a splitting field of g(Z) \u2212 t over Q(t), and if U is a\nsubgroup of A = Gal(L/Q(t)), then LU is the fixed field of U in L.\nFirst suppose that A is an affine permutation group (different from A4\nand S 4 ). Theorems 3.3 and 4.8 gives the candidates for G and A and genus\n0 systems. The only possible degrees are 8 and 16.\nSuppose n = 8. The only possible candidate with a genus 0 system is\nG = AGL3 (2) = A. The rational genus 0 systems in G have type (3, 4, 4),\n(4, 4, 4), (2, 2, 4, 4), (2, 2, 3, 4), or (2, 2, 2, 2, 4).\nThe (3, 4, 4)\u2013tuple must have all branch points rational. By [36], the\nminimal field of definition of such a cover has degree 2 over Q, so this case\nis out.\nIn the (4, 4, 4) case, a minimal field of definition has degree 4 over Q if all\nbranch points are rational. There could possibly be two of the branch points\nconjugate, which would lower the degree of the minimal field of definition by\nat most a factor 2, so this does not occur as well.\nThe cases with 4 and 5 branch points all occur, see Section 5.3.\nNow suppose n = 16. The only cases where G has a genus 0 system of\nthe required form, and \u03c3r fulfills the necessary properties in Lemma 5.1, are\nthe following:\n(a) G has index 2 in (S 4 \u00d7 S 4 ) \u22ca C2 , T = (2, 4, 8).\n(b) G = A = (S 4 \u00d7 S 4 ) \u22ca C2 , T = (2, 6, 8) or T = (2, 2, 2, 12). (This is case\nm = 4 in 2 of Theorem 4.8.)\n(c) G = A = C24 \u22ca S 5 , T = (2, 5, 8), (2, 6, 8), and (2, 2, 2, 8).\nWe start excluding case (a), where G1 = (C3 \u00d7 C3 ) \u22ca C4 , and E has type\n(2, 4, 8). Here [A : G] \u2264 2. The group G has, up to conjugacy, a unique\nsubgroup U of index 8. Set \u0168 := NA (U). Then A = \u0168G, so the fixed field\nL\u0168 is a regular extension of Q(t). Look at the action of A on A/\u0168. With\nrespect to this action, the elements in E have cycle types 2 \u2212 2, 2 \u2212 2 \u2212 4, 8.\nFrom that we get that L\u0168 has genus 0, and because of the totally ramified\nplace at infinity, we have L\u0168 = Q(x) where t = f (x) with f \u2208 Q[X]. Now\nA, in this degree 8 action, preserves a block system of blocks of size 4, and\nthe last element in E leaves the two blocks invariant. Suppose without loss\nthat \u03c32 corresponds to 0. Then this yields (after linear fractional changes)\nf (X) = h(X)2 with h \u2208 Q[X], where h(X) = X 2 (X 2 + pX + p), where the\n75\n\n\framification information tells us that h has, besides 0, two further branch\npoints which are additive inverses\n\u221a to each other. This gives the condition\n2\n27p \u2212 144p + 128 = 0, so p \u2208 Q( 3) \\ Q, a contradiction.\nCases (b) and (c) however have the required arithmetic realizations. As\nthe proof involves a considerable amount of computations, we postpone the\nanalysis to Section 5.3.\nNone of the product action cases in 2 with m \u2265 5 can occur, because by\n3.3 there is no element with two cycles of equal lengths.\nNow assume that A is an almost simple group. Suppose that A is neither\nthe alternating nor the symmetric group in natural action. Theorem 4.8 lists\nthose cases where a transitive normal subgroup G has a genus 0 system. In\nour case, the permutation degree n = 2m is even, and one member \u03c3r of the\ngenus 0 system is a product of two m\u2013cycles. The condition (b) in Lemma\n5.1, namely that \u03c3r is rational in A, already excludes most examples. The\ntwo biggest degrees which survive that condition are n = 22 with G = M22 ,\nA = M22 \u22caC2 and n = 24 with G = A = M24 . However, \u03c3r violates condition\n(d) of Lemma 5.1 in both cases.\nExcluding the case n = 12, G = M12 for a moment, the next smallest\ncases with rational \u03c3r have degree n \u2264 10. We go through the possibilities\nwhich fulfill the necessary properties from Lemma 5.1, starting with the small\ndegrees.\nLet n = 6. Then A = PGL2 (5), and G = PSL2 (5) or G = PGL2 (5). If\nG = A, then T = (4, 4, 3), and an example is given by\ng(Z) =\n\nZ 4 (13Z 2 \u2212 108Z + 225)\n.\n(Z 2 \u2212 15)3\n\nNext suppose G = PSL2 (5). There is the possibility T = (2, 5, 3), with an\nexample\ng(Z) =\n\nZ 5 (Z \u2212 2)\n,\n(Z 2 \u2212 5)3\n\nor T = (2, 2, 2, 3), where\ng(Z) =\n\n(Z 2 \u2212 2Z + 2)(Z 2 \u2212 16Z + 14)2\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)3\n\nis an example.\nLet n = 8. Then A = PGL2 (7), and [A : G] \u2264 2. First suppose G =\nPSL2 (7). Then T = (3, 3, 4). Suppose the required g(Z) exists. Without loss\nassume that \u221e is the branch point corresponding to \u03c33 . The two finite branch\n76\n\n\fpoints could be algebraically conjugate. But there is a Galois extension K/Q\nof degree dividing 4, such that the branch points are in K, and g \u22121 (\u221e) \u2282 K.\nSo, by linear fractional twists over K, we can pass from g to\ng\u0303(Z) =\n\n(Z 2 + a1 Z + a0 )(Z 2 + p1 Z + p0 )3\n.\nZ4\n\nIf a1 6= 0, then we may assume that a1 = 1. If however a1 = 0, then p1 = 0\ncannot hold, because g\u0303 were functionally decomposable. Thus if a1 = 0, we\nmay assume that p1 = 1. Thus we have two cases to consider. Together\nwith the obvious requirement a0 p0 6= 0, and the ramification information in\nthe other finite branch point, this gives a 0\u2013dimensional quasi affine variety.\nSee [38, Sect. I.9] where this kind of computation is explained in detail. By\ncomputing a Gr\u00f6bner bases with respect to the lexicographical order we can\nsolve the system. We obtain an empty set in the second case, and a degree\n4 equation over Q for p1 in the first case. However, this degree 4 polynomial\nturns out to be irreducible over Q with Galois group D4 , hence p1 6\u2208 K, a\ncontradiction.\nNow assume G = A. Then T = (2, 6, 4). The corresponding triple\nis rationally rigid and \u03c32 has a single cycle of length 6, so there exists a\nrational function g(Z) with the required ramification data. Still, we need\nto decide about the fiber g \u22121 (\u221e). We do this by explicitly computing g,\n6\n2 \u22126Z+49)\ngetting g(Z) = Z (9Z\n. So the fiber g \u22121(\u221e) is not real, contrary to\n(Z 2 +7)4\nour requirement.\nLet n = 10. Then S \u2264 A \u2264 Aut(S) with S = A5 or S = A6 . In view of\nthe results we want to achieve, there is little interest in investigating these\ncases more closely.\nFinally, we have to rule out the case n = 12, G = A = M12 . We have\nthe following possibilities for T : (2, 5, 6), (3, 4, 6), (3, 3, 6), (4, 4, 6), (2, 6, 6),\n(2, 8, 6), and (2, 2, 2, 6).\nIn the cases with three branch points, explicit computations are feasible,\nand it turns out that only the two cases (3, 3, 6) and (4, 4, 6) give Galois\nrealizations over Q(t). However, in both cases the subfields of degree 12 over\nQ(t) are not rational. Indeed, in the first case, we get the function field of\nthe quadratic X 2 + Y 2 + 1 = 0, and in the second case, the function field of\nthe quadratic X 2 + 3Y 2 + 5 = 0. In Section 5.3 we give explicit polynomials\nover Q(t) of degree 12 with Galois group M12 and ramification type (3, 3, 6)\nor (4, 4, 6), respectively. However, a variation of the argument below could\nbe used as an alternative.\nSo we need to worry about the ramification type T = (2, 2, 2, 6). The\ncriterion in Lemma 5.1 is too coarse in order to rule out that case. However,\nwe still get rid of this case by considering the action of complex conjugation,\n77\n\n\fand what it does to a genus 0 system. Let E be a genus 0 system of type\nT , and suppose that a function g(Z) exists as required. By passing to a\nreal field k containing g \u22121 (\u221e), we may assume that g(Z) = h(Z)/Z 6 , where\nh[Z] \u2208 k[Z] is a monic polynomial of degree 12 and h(0) 6= 0. If h(0) < 0,\nthen h(Z) \u2212 t0 Z 6 has exactly 2 real roots for t0 \u226a 0 (by a straightforward\nexercise in calculus). However, M12 does not have an involution with only 2\nfixed points, so this case cannot occur.\nThus h(0) > 0. Then, for t0 \u226b 0, h(Z) \u2212 t0 Z 6 has precisely 4 real\nroots. Choose such a t0 \u2208 k with Gal(h(Z) \u2212 t0 Z 6 /k) = M12 . By a linear\nfractional change over k, we can arrange the following: t0 is mapped to t\u03030 ,\nthe branch points of the corresponding rational function g\u0303 are all finite, and\nthe real branch points of g\u0303 are smaller than t\u03030 . Let t\u03030 be the base point\nof a branch cycle description \u03c3 = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 , \u03c34 ) coming from the \"standard\nconfiguration\" as in [38, Sect. I.1.1] or [14, \u00a72]. Note that the order of the\nconjugacy classes here must not be chosen arbitrarily. So the element of\norder 6 is one of the \u03c3i . As k \u2282 R, complex conjugation \u03c1 leaves the set of\nbranch points invariant, but reflects the paths at the real axis, inducing a\nnew branch cycle description \u03c3 \u03c1 . For instance, if all branch points are real,\nwe get\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u03c31\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03c3 \u03c1 = (\u03c31\u22121 , (\u03c32\u22121 )\u03c31 , (\u03c33\u22121 )\u03c32\n\n\u22121 \u22121 \u22121\n\u03c32 \u03c31\n\n, (\u03c34\u22121 )\u03c33\n\n),\n\nand a similar transformation formula holds if there is a pair of complex\nconjugate branch points. For this old result by Hurwitz , see [38, Theorem\nI.1.2], [14].\nIdentify the Galois group Gal(g\u0303(Z) \u2212 t\u0303/k(t\u0303)) with Gal(g\u0303(Z) \u2212 t\u03030 /k), so\nthat they are permutation equivalent on the roots of g\u0303(Z) \u2212 t\u0303 and g\u0303(Z) \u2212 t\u03030 ,\nrespectively. Let \u03c8 be the complex conjugation on the splitting field of g\u0303(Z)\u2212\nt\u03030 . Then, under this identification, \u03c3 \u03c8 = \u03c3 \u03c1 . (Here \u03c3 \u03c8 means simultaneously\nconjugating the components with \u03c8.) This is a result by D\u00e8bes and Fried,\nextending a more special result by Serre [49, 8.4.3] (which does not apply\nhere), see [14] and [38, Theorem I.10.3].\nNow, for instance using GAP, one checks that in all possible configurations\nfor \u03c3 and possibilities of real and complex branch points, an element \u03c8 as\nabove either does not exist, or is a fixed point free involution. However, as\nwe have chosen t\u03030 such that g\u0303(Z) \u2212 t\u03030 has precisely 4 real roots, the case that\n\u03c8 has precisely 4 fixed points should also occur. As this is not the case, we\nhave ruled out the existence of M12 with this specific arithmetic data.\n\n78\n\n\f5.3\n\nComputations\n\nThis section completes the proof of Theorem 5.2 in those cases which require\nor deserve some explicit computations besides theoretical arguments. We\ncontinue to use the notation from there.\n5.3.1\n\nn = 8, G = AGL3 (2).\n\nHere n = 8, and G = A = AGL3 (2). We have already seen that the only possible ramification types could be T = (2, 2, 2, 2, 4), (2, 2, 4, 4), and (2, 2, 3, 4).\nWe will establish examples for all three cases. While deriving possible forms\nof g(Z) we do not give complete justification for each step, because the required properties of g(Z) can be verified directly from the explicit form. Thus\nthe description of the computation is only meant as a hint to the reader how\nwe got the examples.\nIn the construction of examples we employ a 2\u2013parametric family of polynomials of degree 7 over Q(t) with a (2, 2, 2, 2, 4) ramification type and Galois\ngroup PSL2 (7). This family is due to Malle, see [37]. Define\nf\u03b1,\u03b2 (X) :=\n\n(X 3 + 2(\u03b2 \u2212 1)X 2 + (\u03b1 + \u03b2 2 \u2212 4\u03b2)X \u2212 2\u03b1)\n*\nX 2 (X \u2212 2)\n(X 4 \u2212 2(\u03b2 + 2)X 2 + 4\u03b2X \u2212 \u03b1).\n\nOne verifies that for all (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 Q2 in a non\u2013trivial Zariski open subset\nof Q2 , the following holds: f\u03b1,\u03b2 has arithmetic and geometric monodromy\ngroup PSL2 (7) with ramification type (2, 2, 2, 2, 4). The elements of order 2\nare double transpositions, while the element of order 4 has type 1 \u2212 2 \u2212 4.\nWe take the composition f\u03b1,\u03b2 (r(X)), where r \u2208 Q(X) has degree 2, and\nis ramified in 0 and 1. Multiplying r with a suitable constant (depending\non \u03b1 and \u03b2), one can arrange that the discriminant of the numerator of\nf\u03b1,\u03b2 (r(X)) \u2212 t is a square. This can be used to show that the arithmetic\nand geometric monodromy group of f\u03b1,\u03b2 (r(X)) is AGL3 (2) in the degree\n14 action. One can now pass to the fixed field E of GL3 (2) < AGL3 (2) in a\nsplitting field L of f\u03b1,\u03b2 (r(X)) \u2212 t over Q(t). A minimal polynomial F\u03b1,\u03b2 (X, t)\nfor a primitive element of E/Q(t) can be computed, we do not print it here\nbecause it is very long. For that we used a program written by Cuntz based\non KASH[8] which computes subfields in algebraic function fields.\nIt turns out that the degree in t of F\u03b1,\u03b2 (X, t) is 2. So we can easily derive\na condition for the genus 0 field E to be rational. In this case, we get that\nE is rational if and only if \u2212\u03b1 is a sum of two squares in Q. For instance,\n\n79\n\n\fthe choice \u03b1 := \u22121/2, \u03b2 = 1 yields\ng(Z) =\n\n(13Z 4 + 60Z 3 + 100Z 2 + 72Z + 20)(11Z 4 + 8Z 3 \u2212 12Z 2 \u2212 16Z + 12)\n.\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)4\n\nNext we want to see how to get the cases with 4 branch points. Let \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 (t)\nbe the discriminant of a numerator of f\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2212 t with respect to X. A necessary\ncondition for having only 4 branch points is that the discriminant of \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 (t)\nwith respect to t vanishes. This gives a condition on \u03b1 and \u03b2, and if one\nperforms the computation, it follows that this condition is given by the union\nof two genus 0 curves which are birationally isomorphic to P1 (Q) over Q. For\nthe computation of such a birational map, we made use of the Maple package\nalgcurves by Mark van Hoeij (available at http://klein.math.fsu.edu/ \u0303hoeij,\nalso implemented in Maple V Release 5).\nAn example for the ramification type (2, 2, 4, 4) is\ng(Z) =\n\n(3Z 2 \u2212 15Z + 20)Z 2\n,\n(Z 2 \u2212 5)4\n\nwhereas\ng(Z) =\n\n(11Z 2 + 30Z + 18)(3Z 2 + 30Z \u2212 46)3\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)4\n\nis an example of ramification type (2, 2, 3, 4).\n5.3.2\n\nn = 16, G = (S4 \u00d7 S4 ) \u22ca C2\n\nHere n = 16, and G = A = (S4 \u22ca S4 ) \u22ca C2 in product action of the wreath\nproduct S4 \u2240 C2 . First suppose that E has type (2, 6, 8). There are two such\npossibilities, both being rationally rigid. The first has fine type (2 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \u2212\n2, 3\u22126\u22126, 8\u22128), and the second one has fine type (2\u22122\u22122\u22122\u22122\u22122, 2\u22123\u2212\n3\u22126, 8\u22128). From this we can already read off that there is a rational function\ng(Z) \u2208 Q(Z) of degree 16 and the ramification data and monodromy groups\ngiven as above. Let \u03c33 correspond to the place at infinity. One verifies that\n\u22121\nthe centralizer CA (\u03c33 ) is intransitive, so\n\u221a g (\u221e) \u2282 K\u221a\u222a {\u221e}, where K\u221ais a\nquadratic subfield of Q(\u03b68 ), so K = Q( \u22121), K = Q( \u22122), or K = Q( 2).\nThe first two possibilities cannot hold, because complex conjugation would\nyield an involution in A, which inverts \u03c33 , and interchanges the two cycles of\n\u03c33 . One verifies that such an element does not exist. Let D\u0303 be the normalizer\nin A of I := <\u03c33 >. Then D\u0303 contains a decomposition group D of a place of\nL lying above the infinite place of Q(t). Also, [D : I] \u2265 4 by rationality of \u03c33 .\nOn the other hand, [D\u0303 : I] = 4. Thus D = D\u0303. But D\u0303 interchanges the two\n80\n\n\fcycles of \u03c33 , so the elements in g \u22121 (\u221e) cannot be rational. This establishes\nthe existence of g of the required type.\nIn this situation, we were lucky that theoretical arguments gave a positive\nexistence result. However, it is also quite amusing to take advantage of the\nspecific form of A and compute an explicit example from the data given here.\nRecall that G = A = S4 \u2240 C2 is in product action. To this wreath product there belongs a subgroup U of index 8, which is a point stabilizer corresponding to the natural imprimitive action of A. The fine types of the\ntwo (2, 6, 8)\u2013tuples with respect to this degree 8 action are (2, 2 \u2212 6, 8) and\n(2 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \u2212 2, 2 \u2212 3, 8), respectively. One verifies immediately that LU is a\nrational field, indeed LU = Q(x), where t = h(x)2 with h \u2208 Q[X]. The idea\nis to compute this field, and then extract from that the degree 16 extension\nwe are looking for.\nIn the first case, we may assume h of the form h(X) = X 3 (X \u22121), whereas\nh(X) = X 3 (X \u2212 8) + 216 (note that h(X) + 216 = (X \u2212 6)2 (X 4 + 4X + 12))\nin the second case.\nWe have h(x)2 = t. Set y := h(x), and let x\u2032 be a root of h(X) = \u2212y.\nThen also h(x\u2032 )2 = t. However, x+x\u2032 is fixed under a suitable point stabilizer\nof A with respect to the degree 16 action of the wreath product S4 \u2240 C2 in\npower action.\nTake the first possibility for h. Using resultants, one immediately computes a minimal polynomial H(W, t) of w := x + x\u2032 over Q(t):\nH(W, t) = W 16 \u2212 8W 15 + 27W 14 \u2212 50W 13 + 55W 12 \u2212 36W 11 + 13W 10\n\u22122W 9 + 136tW 8 \u2212 544tW 7 + 892tW 6 \u2212 744tW 5 + 315tW 4\n\u221254tW 3 + 16t2 .\nHere, however, t appears quadratic, so this does not immediately yield the\nfunction g we are looking for. However, it is easy to write down a parametrization for the curve H(W, t) = 0:\nZ(2Z + 3)\nZ2 \u2212 2\n1 Z 6 (Z + 2)6 (2Z + 3)3\nt=\u2212\n=: g(Z).\n16\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)8\n\nW =\n\nThe function g(Z) parameterizing t is the function we are looking for.\nSimilarly, the second possibility of h gives a function\ng(Z) =\n\n(Z 2 + 4Z + 6)(Z \u2212 2)2 (3Z 2 \u2212 4Z + 2)3\n.\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)8\n81\n\n\fBy Theorem 4.8, there is, for this setup, also the possibility of a (2, 2, 2, 8)\nsystem. This is no longer rigid. But even if we could show, for instance using\na braid rigidity criterion as in [38, Chapt. III], the existence of a regular\nGalois extension L/Q(t) with the correct data, we would not be able to\ndecide about rationality of the degree 16 subfield we are after. However, the\nfollowing computations will display and solve the problem.\nWith s \u2208 Q arbitrary set h(X) := X 4 + 2sX 2 + (8s + 32)X + s2 \u2212 4s \u2212 24.\nOne verifies that the splitting field of h(X)2 \u2212t over Q(t) is regular with Galois\ngroup A, and that we have the ramification given by the (2, 2, 2, 8) system,\nprovided that s 6\u2208 \u22124, \u22123, \u221212. (The cases s = \u22123 and s = \u221212 give the\nfirst and second possibilities from above, whereas for s = \u22124 the monodromy\ngroup of h is D4 rather than S4 .) Again, let x be with h(x)2 = t, and x\u2032\nbe with h(x\u2032 ) = \u2212h(x). As above, derive a minimal polynomial H(W, t) for\nx + x\u2032 over Q(t). One calculates that the curve H(W, t) = 0 is birationally\nisomorphic to the quadratic U 2 \u2212 2V 2 = 4s + 16. Of course, it depends on s\nwhether this quadratic has a rational point, which in turn is equivalent that\nLU (U from above) is a rational function field. But if one chooses s such that\n4s + 16 = u20 \u2212 2v02 for u0 , v0 \u2208 Q, then LU is rational, and from the explicit\nchoice of a rational point on the quadratic we get g(Z), parameterized by\n(u0 , v0 ), where two such pairs give the same function if u20 \u2212 2v02 = u\u20320 2 \u2212 2v0\u2032 2 .\nUp to the details which are routine, this shows that the ramification type\n(2, 2, 2, 8) appears as well.\n5.3.3\n\nn = 16, G = C24 \u22ca S5\n\nNow G = A = C24 \u22ca S5 , where the action of S5 is on the S5 \u2013invariant\nhyperplane of the natural permutation module for S5 over F2 . We verify that\nthe genus 0 systems of type (2, 5, 8) and (2, 6, 8) are rationally rigid, also, it\nfollows from the ramification type, that the degree 16 field we are looking\nfor is rational. As in the previous case, we can recognize the decomposition\ngroup (belonging to the inertia group I := <\u03c33 >) as the normalizer of I in A,\nand from the properties of NA (I) we can read off, exactly as in the previous\ncase, that g(Z) = h(Z)/(Z 2 \u2212 2)8 exists as required.\nExplicit computation is different from the previous case. Suppose we\nhave the ramification type (2, 5, 8). As an abstract group, A = V \u22ca S5 ,\nwhere V < F52 is the hyperplane of vectors with coordinate sum 0, and S5\npermutes the coordinates naturally. This interpretation of A as a subgroup\nof the wreath product C2 \u2240 S5 gives an imprimitive faithful degree 10 action\nof A. Let U be the corresponding subgroup of index 10. One verifies that\nLU is the root field of h(X 2 ) \u2212 t, where h(Y ) = (Y \u2212 1)5 /Y . Let yi be the\nroots of h(Y ) \u2212 t, i = 1, . . . , 5, and for each i, let xi be a square root of\n82\n\n\fyi . Set w = x1 + x2 + * * * + x5 . We Q\ncompute a minimal polynomial H(W, t)\nfor w. Namely consider H(W, t) := (X + \u01eb1 x1 + \u01eb2 x2 + * * * + \u01eb5 x5 ), where\nthe product is over \u01ebi \u2208 {\u22121, 1}, such that the sum of the entries for each\noccuring tuple is 0. Obviously, H(w, t) = 0, and H(W, t) \u2208 Q[W, t]. As to\nthe practical computation, we computed the solutions of h(X) \u2212 t in Laurent\nseries in 1/t1/5 around the place with inertia group order 5. Eventually, after\ncalculations similar as above, we get\n(Z \u2212 1)(Z 2 + Z \u2212 1)5\ng(Z) =\n.\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)8\nIf the ramification type is (2, 6, 8), then L is the splitting field of h(X 2 )\u2212t,\nwith h(Y ) = (2Y 2 \u2212 27)2 (Y 2 \u2212 1)3 /Y 2 , and after similar computations we\nget\ng(Z) =\n\n(5Z 2 + 4Z \u2212 10)(Z + 2)2 (5Z 2 \u2212 12Z + 6)3\n.\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)8\n\nAlso, the case (2, 2, 2, 8) is not hard to establish by the procedure described above. An example (as part of a 1\u2013parameter family) is\n(15Z 4 \u2212 74Z 3 + 140Z 2 \u2212 124Z + 44)2\n*\n(Z 2 \u2212 2)8\n(47Z 8 \u2212 472Z 7 + 1912Z 6 \u2212 4272Z 5 + 4840Z 4 \u2212 1824Z 3 \u2212 288Z 2 \u2212 64Z \u2212 16).\ng(Z) =\n\n5.3.4\n\nn = 12, G = M12\n\nIn order to rule out the ramification types T = (3, 3, 6) and (4, 4, 6), we\ncomputed explicitly polynomials F (X, t) of degree 12 over Q(t), such that\nthe splitting field L has Galois group M12 over Q(t), and the ramification\ntype T . From the explicit form of F (X, t) we can read off that a degree\n12 extension E in L of Q(t) cannot be a rational field. Nowadays such\ncomputations are routine, so we just give the polynomials.\nFor T = (3, 3, 6) we obtain\nF (X, t) = X 12 + 396X 10 + 27192X 9 + 933174X 8 + 20101752X 7 +\n(\u22122t + 169737744)X 6 + 16330240872X 5 +\n(8820t + 538400028969)X 4 + (92616t + 8234002812376)X 3 +\n(\u22123895314t + 195276967064388)X 2 +\n(\u221248378792t + 3991355037576144)X +\nt2 + 62267644t + 30911476378259268,\n83\n\n\fand for T = (4, 4, 6) we get\nF (X, t) = X 12 + 44088X 10 + 950400X 9 + 721955520X 8 +\n31696106112X 7 + (2t + 5460734649920)X 6 +\n393700011065856X 5 +\n(\u2212120180t + 20231483772508800)X 4 +\n(\u22122587680t + 911284967252689920)X 3 +\n(137561760t + 21295725373309787136)X 2 +\n(4418468352t + 183784500436675461120)X +\nt2 + 31440107840t + 3033666001201482093568.\nAs t is quadratic in both cases, it is easy to compute a quadratic Q such\nthat E is the field of rational functions on Q. Then E is rational if and only\nif Q has a rational point. However, in both cases there is not even a real\npoint on Q. This actually indicates that the argument we used to exclude\nT = (2, 2, 2, 6) might be applicable here as well. One can verify that this is\nindeed the case.\n\n6\n\nApplications to Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem\n\nImmediate consequences of Theorems 4.8, 4.9, 5.2, and 5.3 are\nTheorem 6.1.
