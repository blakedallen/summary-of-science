We shall focus here\non a region transmitting stress but otherwise unloaded.\nThis system of continuum equations is incomplete without d(d \u2212 1)/2 further constitutive relations. The central\nmystery we are seeking to unravel is the nature of these\nrelations (one relation in two dimensions) when they also\narise from force balance at the granular level.\nThe key idea of this Letter, where we limit ourselves\nfor simplicity to the two dimensional case, is to focus\nattention on local loops around contact points and corresponding loop forces. Each local void, which we will label\nby an index l, is enclosed by a loop of grains and contact\npoints; each contact point separates two voids and so is\nparty to two loops. Around each loop we take a loop\nforce f~l to circulate in the anticlockwise direction, that\nis +f~l is contributed to each intergranular force around\nthe loop with (notionally) positive sign in the anticlockwise direction, and vice versa for the reaction forces. The\nresulting total force across a contact point is then a difference between two contributing loop forces.\nThe loop forces have two key features, the first being\nthat they parameterise the intergranular forces in a manner that automatically satisfies balance of force at each\ncontact point and on each grain. In terms of them we\ncan write the stress tensor on each grain as\nX\n\u015cg =\n(2)\n~rlg f~l\n\n64.60.Ak, 05.10.c 61.90.+d\n\nIt has long been recognized in engineering practice\nthat granular materials which lack cohesion cannot be regarded entirely as solids, nor (until 'fluidised' or yielding)\ncan they be regarded entirely as fluids [1]. In this Letter\nwe explore the scenario that there exists a marginal state\nof granular matter in between solid and liquid. Most\nparticularly, we are concerned with how that intermediate state transmits stress.\nThe marginal state is readily characterised in terms of\nthe mean coordination number z\u0304 for mechanical equilibrium. If external loads, such as gravity, are exerted on\na pile of N grains [2] then the N z\u0304/2 intergranular forces\nmust be able to adjust so as to achieve N d(d + 1)/2 constraints balancing the force and torque on each grain in d\ndimensions. For perfectly rough grains, where every contact supports friction, this gives a critical coordination\nnumber zc = d + 1, whilst for ideally smooth asymmetric\ngrains with no friction zc = d(d + 1) [3], [4], [5].\nFor mean coordination numbers z\u0304 < zc the pile cannot\nbe stable and under a general loading it must rearrange\nor consolidate. By contrast for z\u0304 > zc the intergranular forces are underdetermined by the conditions of force\nbalance alone and the deformation of individual grains\ntogether with their local constitutive equations becomes\nrelevant. In the first case we have granular motion and\nthe pile is fluid or yielding, whereas in the latter case intragranular deformation is crucial and we have a solid of\nconstitution influenced by that of the individual grains.\nIt is interesting to note that for ideally smooth grains,\n\nl\n\nwhere ~rlg is the vector connecting (anticlockwise) the two\ncontact points shared by loop l and grain g and\nPAg is the\ngrain area defined in fig. 1 [9]. The vectors g ~rlg = 0\nform an anticlockwise\nPloop round the contact points of\nrlg = 0 forms a clockwise loop\nloop l and likewise\nl~\nround the contact points of grain g and play a central\ngeometrical role in our discussion.\n1\n\n\fThe second key feature of the loop forces is that, being\ndefined on the loops which are half as numerous as the\ngrains, they are a comparatively coarse-grained quantity.\nThe hidden nature of the constitutive equation can now\nreadily be appreciated, because the only remaining constraints that the loop forces have to obey is balance of\ntorque around each grain, that is\nX\n~rlg \u00d7 f~l = 0\n(3)\n\nwhose boundary is defined by the contact points of the\noutermost grains. Averaging over \u015cg in the region using\neq. (4) gives\n\u03c3\u0302 =\n\nwhich is one equation per grain and hence two equations\nper loop.\nIn essence the two torque equations per loop give us\ntwo macroscopic conditions, A(\u03c3\u0302) = 0 plus a constitutive relation. To achieve this separation explicitly we\npostulate a smooth interpolation of the loop forces to a\nfunction of continuous position f~(~r), with each loop and\n~ l and R\n~ g , respectively.\ngrain having a nominal centre R\nThis also introduces a natural continuum already at the\ngrain scale without going into elaborate coarse-graining\nschemes. Then the force moment on grain g is, to a first\norder Taylor approximation,\n\n\u03c3\u0302 =\n\n\u0108g =\n\n~ lg\n~rlg R\n\nand\n\nl\n\n~ lg = R\n~l \u2212 R\n~ g.\nR\n\n(4)\n\nl\n\n2\n\n(~slg ~slg \u2212 ~tlg~tlg )\n\n(9)\n\n(11)\n\nThis result is particularly reassuring because it yields the\neffective response of a macroscopic granular region to a\nforce field in terms of an effective macroscopic characteristic property h\u0108g i. It is equivalent to results in contexts\nsuch as disordered dielectrics and continuum elasticity\nthat are derived by combining a field equation with either a constitutive relation or an energy functional.\nWe can now construct the constitutive equation in\nterms of the continuum stress tensor, which is given from\neq. (10) as \u03c3\u0302 = Df~ where D is exactly the curl operator\nin two dimensions. The condition that the stress tensor\non each grain be symmetric then leads, over and above\nthe condition that the continuous \u03c3\u0302 be symmetric, to the\nrequirement\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n01\nwhere R\u0302 = \u22121\n0 is the unit antisymetric tensor (also\ncorresponding to \u03c02 -rotation in the plane) and Ag is the\narea associated with grain g shaded in figure 1. The\nareas Ag have the convenient property of tessalating the\nplane. The symmetric part, P\u0302g , reflects fluctuation in\nthe departure of the local geometry from isotropy, being\ngiven by\n\nP\u0302g =\n\n~rb f~b ,\n\nboundary\n\n~ f~i = h\u0108g i * h\u2207\n~ f~i .\nh\u0108g * \u2207\n\n\u0001\n\nX1\n\nX\n\nSince hP\u0302g i = 0 we identify h\u0108g i = AR\u0302 and, on comparing\nto eq. (8), we obtain\n\nThe geometric tensors \u0108g characterise the grain local\ngeometry and their symmetric and antisymmetric parts\nhave quite distinctive properties. It is readily shown that\n\u0108g = Ag R\u0302 + P\u0302g\n\n1\nA\n\nwhere f~b is the external loading on the region. This contour sum can be converted, using Stokes theorem, into\nZ\n1\n~ f~ = R\u0302 * h\u2207\n~ f~i .\n\u03c3\u0302 =\ndsR\u0302 * \u2207\n(10)\nA\n\nwhere\nX\n\n(8)\n\nCarrying out the same summation using eq. (2) we observe that the sum over loops inside the region cancels\nout and the only contribution comes from the boundary\nvectors, ~rb , between boundary contact points,\n\nl\n\n~ f~\n\u015cg = \u0108g * \u2207\n\n1 X\n~ f~ = h\u0108g * \u2207\n~ f~i .\n\u0108g * \u2207\nA g\n\nTr(Q\u0302 * \u03c3\u0302) = 0,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Q\u0302 = R\u0302 * P\u0302 * R\u0302T is a rotated verion of the symmetric\npart of the local \u0108g tensor. Relation (12) is the continuum constitutive equation that provides the missing link\nbetween the stress and the local geometry. It has the\nstriking feature that the coefficients Q\u0302 are spatially fluctuating quantities that locally add to zero, so that any\nsimple attempt to identify a non-vanishing mean field\nvalue hQ\u0302i leads back to Eq. (1) and therefore yields no\nnew constitutive information. In this sense the problem\nis analogous to spin glasses, in our case it being \u03c3\u0302 that is\nsubject to spatial couplings of random sign [10].\nConstitutive equations coupling stress components in\na local linear relation, represented here by (12), have\nbeen discussed before under the presumption that a nonvanishing macroscopic version of Q\u0302 exists. Examples are\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the vectors ~slg and ~tlg are shown on figure 1. It is\na crucial point that neighbouring grains share equal and\nopposite contributions ~s~s and \u2212~t~t to their P\u0302 tensors, and\nfrom this it follows that the average hP\u0302 iG of P\u0302 over all\nthe grains in any convex region G goes to zero at least\n\u22121/2\nas fast as NG , where NG is the number of grains in\nG. Note that the averaging of the Pg does not depend\non any assumptions of isotropy. For periodic lattices hP\u0302 i\nvanishes over one unit cell.\nTo underpin the significance of Cg as the relevant geometrical order parameter, consider a region of area A\n2\n\n\fthe hypotheses of \"fixed principal axes\" [11] (corresponding to Q\u0302 being traceless) and \"oriented stress linearity\"\n[12] that were introduced to describe sand piles [7]. Having shown that the simple grain average of Q\u0302 vanishes,\nwe are therefore particularly motivated to consider any\ncase where a non-zero effective Q\u0302 can be identified.\nDrawing inspiration from spin problems, we focus on\nthe analogy of an antiferromagnet in which the local P\u0302\ntensors have alternation of sign in an unfrustrated pattern. The key idea is that for systems where every loop\nhas an even number of edges, we can label all grains +\nor - such that each grain is surrounded only by opposite\nsign neighbours in an unfrustrated way. Then we can\ndistinguish locally averaged values P\u0302+ and P\u0302\u2212 restricted\nto the respective + and \u2212 grains, where P\u0302+ + P\u0302\u2212 = 0. If\nthe pile has staggered geometrical order such that these\nare non-zero, then this leads to the identification\nQ\u0302eff = R\u0302P\u0302+ R\u0302T\n\norder parameter is p = Limit\u01eb\u21920 P+ /\u01eb. This order parameter, and hence the corresponding Qeff , can have a\nnon-zero average for an orientationally ordered assembly\nof smooth grains, as computed explicitly for a periodic\narray [5]. This contrast to the case of general rough grain\npiles, which explicitly require staggered orientational order for a non-zero Qeff , suggests that piles of perfectly\nsmooth grains may be inherently distinct from piles of\nrough ones.\nFinally we introduce an alternative formulation of the\nproblem where the loop forces are defined in terms of\na potential field. Since each loop is associated with a\ntwo-dimensional force the number of degrees of freedom\nthat the potentials should provide is twice the \u221anumber\nof loops, which (up to relative correction of 1/ N due\nto the boundary) is exactly the number of grains in the\nsystem. Thus, we require that the potential field provide\none degree of freedom per grain leading to scalar grain\npotentials, \u03c8g . A natural way to precisely define the\npotentials is to choose that the forces are derived from\nthem via\n\u22121 X\n~rlg \u03c8g ,\n(17)\nf~l =\nAl g\n\n(13)\n\nThe simplest such case where we can see this work is a\nperiodic lattice (fig. 2) with a generally anisotropic unit\ncell comprising of two grains, which we duly label + and\n\u2212. Using eq. (4) for each grain separately, we write down\nthe mean and deviatory cell stresses, for which we find\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\n~ f~\n(14)\n\u03c3\u0302 = \u015c+ + \u015c\u2212 = AR\u0302 + P\u0302+ + P\u0302\u2212 * \u2207\n\nand the potentials are then governed by eq. (3).\nWe now assume that the \u03c8-field can be continued\nthroughout the system just as we did previously for the\nforce field. Then expanding around the loop centres, we\nobtain\n\nand\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\n~ f~ ,\n\u03b4\u0302 = \u015c+ \u2212 \u015c\u2212 = \u03b4AR\u0302 + P\u0302+ \u2212 P\u0302\u2212 * \u2207\n\n(15)\n\n1\n~ .\n\u0108l * \u2207\u03c8\n(18)\nf~l =\nAl\nP\n~ lg is the loop anaThe geometrical tensor \u0108l = g ~rlg R\nlogue of \u0108g and its antisymmetric part is likewise associated with an area Al , where these areas tessalate the\nplane. The symmetric part of \u0108l is sensitive to the choice\nof grain centre positions: as there are two grains per loop\nthese constitute four degrees of freedom per \u0108l tensor\nand the expectation is that these tensors can thereby be\nchosen to be purely antisymmetric. Using \u0108l = Al R\u0302 simplifies the expression of the local stress in terms of the\npotentials to\n\nwhere A is the unit cell area and \u03b4A = A+ \u2212 A\u2212 is\nthe difference between the areas associated with the two\ngrains. Using the periodic properties of the lattice one\nreadily obtains\n1X\nP\u0302+ = \u2212P\u0302\u2212 =\n~sk ~sk \u2212 ~tk~tk\n(16)\n2\nk\n\nwhere the vectors ~sk and ~tk are labelled on figure 2. Then\nthe condition that both \u03b4\u0302 as well as \u03c3\u0302 be symmetric then\nleads to the constitutive equation (12) with Q\u0302 replaced\naccording to (13).\nThe idea of a staggered order parameter can be further\nexploited to formulate a mapping from perfectly smooth\nto perfectly rough systems. Given a pile of perfectly\nsmooth grains, we note that its behaviour is identical\nto the same pile of rough grains provided at each contact\npoint we insert a vanishingly small perfectly rough ball\nbearing. It is readily checked that starting from z\u0304 = 6\nfor the smooth grains leads to z\u0304 = 3 for the resulting\nset of rough grains (3/4 of which are the new bearings\neach having z = 2), so we duly arrive at a marginally\nconnected set of rough grains. Furthermore, we automatically have an alternating distinction between original grains (+) and bearings (\u2212). Explicit evaluation\nshows that for each small grain, P\u0302\u2212 \u221d \u01eb as bearing radius \u01eb \u2192 0, so in this case the appropriate geometrical\n\n\u015cg = \u0108g R\u0302T Dg Dl \u03c8\n\n(19)\n\nand the continuum stress becomes\n\u03c3\u0302 = Dg Dl \u03c8 \u2192 curl curl\u03c8 .\n\n(20)\n\nIt follows that the continuous version of \u03c8 is exactly the\nAiry stress function [13].\nTo conclude, we have formulated a theory of stress\ntransmission in granular matter at the marginal state between solid and fluid in terms of loop forces, which in turn\ncan be defined in terms of a scalar potential. Granular\nsystems can possess a predominant antiferromagnetic order but with local frustration, much like in antiferromagnetic Ising systems. An antiferromagnetic order yields a\n3\n\n\f+\n\ns3\n\nt3\n\nt2\n\n+\n\ns2\n\ng\n\ns1\nt1\n\n+\n\n-\n\nr00\n11\nlg\n\n111\n000\nt\nlg\n\n11\n00\nRlg\nslg\n11\n00\nFIG. 2. Part of an anisotropic periodic lattice, where\nthere are two distinct grains, labelled + and -, per\nunit cell. Stress P\ntransmission is controlled by the tensor\nP\u0302+ = \u2212P\u0302\u2212 = 21 k ~sk~sk \u2212 ~tk~tk . The lattice vectors are\n~t1 + ~s3 , ~t2 + ~s1 and ~t3 + ~s2 and because these are not independent the value of P\u0302+ turns out to be independent of the\nchoice of loop centre.\n\nl\nFIG. 1.

As can be seen from the labelling of the\nvectors ~slg and ~tlg in the figure, neighbouring grains share\nequal and opposite contributions to their repsective P\u0302g , so\nthese tensors tend to zero upon local averaging.\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nglobal consitutive relation leading to a macroscopic theory while frustration requires a more sophisticated approach. The similarity between random granular piles\nand spin glasses suggests a possible use of methods from\nthe latter to this problem. We have mapped smooth piles\nto antiferromagnetically ordered perfectly rough ones obtaining for them an exact constitutive relation. This result points to an inherent difference between rough (frustrated) and smooth (ordered) systems and may thus undermine the idea of gaining insight into behaviour of piles\nof finite friction grains from understanding the perfectly\nsmooth and perfectly rough limits.\nAn extension of this work to three dimensions is currently under way.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Prof Sir S.
