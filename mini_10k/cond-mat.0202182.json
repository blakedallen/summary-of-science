The calculated energy-momentum dispersion exhibits characteristics similar to those of a mode\nproposed sometime ago by Lieb within a 1D model, as well as some rotonlike features.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Yv, 03.75.Fi, 05.30.Jp\n\nApproximately forty years ago, Lieb and Liniger [1]\nemployed the Bethe Ansatz to obtain an exact diagonalization of the model Hamiltonian that describes a onedimensional (1D) Bose gas interacting via a repulsive \u03b4function potential. Based on this solution Lieb [2] proposed an intriguing dual interpretation of the spectrum\nof elementary excitations, either in terms of the familiar Bogoliubov mode, or in terms of a certain kind of a\nparticle-hole excitation which will hereafter be referred to\nas the Lieb mode. The energy-momentum dispersions of\nthe Bogoliubov and the Lieb modes coincide at low momenta, where they both display the linear dependence\ncharacteristic of sound-wave propagation in an interacting Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), but the Lieb dispersion is significantly different at finite momenta where\nit exhibits a surprising 2\u03c0 periodicity. Yet this new mode\nremained somewhat of a theoretical curiosity because of\nthe absence of a physical realization of a strictly 1D Bose\ngas.\nIn a curious turn of events, the above subject reemerged in connection with the solitary waves calculated\nanalytically within a 1D classical Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)\nmodel [3, 4], which were later shown to provide an approximate but fairly accurate description of the quantum\nLieb mode for practically all coupling strengths [5, 6].\nMore importantly, the same solitary waves motivated\nexperimental observation of similar coherent structures\nin BEC of alkali-metal atoms through phase imprinting\nor phase engineering [7, 8]. Therefore, an opportunity\npresents itself for experimental realization of the Lieb\nmode.\nIt is clear that a theoretical investigation based on effective 1D models often used to describe cylindrical traps\nwill lead to the prediction of a Lieb mode, by arguments\nsimilar to those employed in the original 1D classical\nmodel [5, 6]. However, one should also question the stability of the corresponding solitons within the proper 3D\nenvironment of a realistic trap [9, 10]. For example, dark\nsolitons created within a spherical trap were observed to\ndecay into vortex rings [11]. This observation was also\nsupported by a numerical calculation in which an initial\ndark-soliton configuration is let to evolve in time according to the GP equation.\nTherefore, although the production of solitary waves\n\nthrough phase imprinting clearly suggests some distinct\n1D characteristics, it should be expected that a proper\nunderstanding of such waves must also account for 3D\neffects that are inevitably present in a realistic BEC. One\ncould envisage a picture in which the actual solitary wave\nis a hybrid of a 1D soliton and a 3D vortex ring. It is the\naim of the present paper to make the above claim precise\nby calculating solitons propagating along a cylindrical\ntrap without making a priori assumptions about their\neffective dimensionality. Our approach was motivated by\nthe calculation of vortex rings in a homogeneous BEC\ndue to Jones and Roberts [12] and a similar calculation\nof semitopological solitons in planar ferromagnets [13].\nExplicit results will be presented for a set of parameters that roughly correspond to the experiment of\nRef. [7]. Thus we consider a cigar-shaped trap filled\nwith 87 Rb atoms, with a transverse confinement frequency \u03c9\u22a5 = 2\u03c0p\n\u00d7 425 Hz and a corresponding oscillator length a\u22a5 = h\u0304/m\u03c9\u22a5 \u2248 0.5\u03bcm. The coupling constant is written as Uo = 4\u03c0h\u03042 a/m where a \u2248 50 \u00c5 is the\nscattering length. We make the approximation of an\ninfinitely-long cylindrical trap with average linear density\n\u03bd = 0.2 atoms/\u00c5 and introduce the dimensionless combinations of parameters \u03b3 = \u03bda = 10 and \u03b3\u22a5 = \u03bda\u22a5 = 103 .\nFinally, rationalized units are defined\n\u221a through the rescalings t \u2192 t/\u03c9\u22a5 , r \u2192 a\u22a5 r, and \u03a8 \u2192 \u03bd \u03a8/a\u22a5 .\nThe energy functional extended to include a chemical\npotential is then given by\nZ\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n\u2207\u03a8\u2217 \u2207\u03a8 + \u03c12 \u03a8\u2217 \u03a8 + g(\u03a8\u2217 \u03a8)2 \u2212 2\u03bc \u03a8\u2217 \u03a8 dV ,\nW =\n2\n(1)\nwhere g = 4\u03c0\u03b3 and \u03c12 = x2 + y 2 , and yields energy in\nunits of \u03b3\u22a5 h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 while the chemical potential \u03bc is still\nmeasured in units of h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 .

In the second step\nof Eq.

The ground-state\nwave function \u03a8 = \u03a80 (\u03c1) was calculated as a stationary\npoint of the energy functional (1) by a variant of a relaxation\nalgorithm [14] and is normalized according to\nR\u221e\n2\u03c0\u03c1\nd\u03c1\n|\u03a80 |2 = 1 to conform with our choice of ratio0\nnalized units. The chemical potential was found to be\n\u03bc = 6.4324 for \u03b3 = 10. We have also recalculated the lowest branch of the Bogoliubov spectrum from which we\nextracted the speed of sound c = 1.77 in units of a\u22a5 \u03c9\u22a5 .\nThis numerical estimate at \u03b3 = 10 is consistent to within\n1% with the Thomas-Fermi approximation c = \u03b3 1/4 which\nwas previously derived in a number of papers [15, 16, 17]\nand was employed for the analysis of experimental data\n[18].\nThus we turn to the calculation of axially-symmetric\nsolitary waves described by a wave function of the form\n\u03a8 = \u03a8(\u03c1, \u03be) where \u03be = z \u2212 vt and v is the constant velocity along the z axis.

(3) were obtained by a sophisticated\nNewton-Raphson iterative algorithm [12, 13] which will\nnot be described here in any detail. For values of the\nvelocity v near the speed of sound c, the calculated solitary wave is a rarefaction pulse that may be thought of\nas a mild soundlike disturbance of the ground state. The\ndominant features of the solitary wave are pronounced as\nthe velocity is decreased to lower values and become reasonably apparent at v = c/2, as shown in Fig. 1 which provides a complete illustration of the wave function through\nits real and imaginary parts. A partial but more transparent illustration is given in frame I of Fig. 2 where we\ndepict the radial dependence of the local particle density\nn = |\u03a8|2 for various values of \u03be. It is clear that the density\nnear the center of the soliton (\u03be = 0) vanishes on a ring\nwith a relatively large radius R \u2243 2.8, thus a vortex ring\nis beginning to emerge. The features of the vortex ring\nbecome completely apparent, and its radius is tightened,\nas we proceed to yet smaller values of the velocity. A\nnotable special case is the static (v = 0) vortex ring with\nradius R \u2243 1.8 illustrated in frame II of Fig. 2, which is\nfar from being a completely dark (black) solitary wave.\nOne would think that pushing the velocity v to negative values would retrace the calculated sequence of solitary waves backwards. In fact, our algorithm continues\n\n\f3\n\n0\n\nwhere n0 = |\u03a80 (\u03c1)|2 is the ground-state particle density\nand \u03b4\u03c6 is the weighted average of the phase difference\nbetween the two ends of the trap. Here we simply postulate the validity of definition (5) and note that the corresponding group-velocity relation v = dE/dQ was satisfied\nto an excellent accuracy in our numerical calculation. On\nthe other hand, the virial relation (4) was verified using\nthe standard linear momentum P of Eq. (2), as expected.\nThe calculated dispersion E = E(Q) is depicted in\nFig. 3 by a solid line along which we place the symbols\nI, II and III that correspond to the special cases of the\nsolitary wave discussed above. At low Q the dispersion\nis linear, E = c |Q|, a feature that it shares with the Bogoliubov dispersion. However, the energy now reaches a\nmaximum at point II where v = 0 and Q is slightly greater\nthat \u03c0. Interestingly, the group velocity becomes negative in the region (II,III) or, equivalently, the impulse is\nopposite to the group velocity. This rotonlike behavior\ncould develop into a full-scale roton if the terminal point\nIII actually turns out to be an inflection point beyond\nwhich the group velocity may begin to rise again. We\nhave not been able to somehow continue our sequence\nof solitary waves beyond point III, nor have we ruled\nout such a possibility. In any case, the picture just described, together with the fact that the calculated radius\nof the vortex ring is monotonically decreasing along the\nsequence (I,II,III) comes close to the Onsager-Feynman\nview of a roton as the ghost of a vanished vortex ring\n[19].\nThe branch of the dispersion shown by a solid line in\n\n3\nIV\n\n\u03b3 = 10\n\nII\n2\nIII\nE\n\nto converge to vortex rings of smaller radii until a critical velocity v = \u2212v0 \u2243 \u22120.475 c is encountered where the\nvortex ring achieves its minimum radius Rmin \u2243 0.8 and\nceases to exist for smaller values of v. The terminal state\nat v = \u2212v0 is illustrated in frame III of Fig. 2. We have\nthus described a sequence of solitary waves with velocities in the range \u2212v0 < v < c, which does not contain a\nblack soliton. An equivalent sequence is obtained in the\nrange \u2212c < v < v0 simply by reversing the relative sign between the real and imaginary part of the wave function,\nas is evident from Eq. (3).\nIt is now important to calculate the energy-momentum\ndispersion. The excitation energy is defined as E =\nW \u2212 W0 where both W and W0 are calculated from\nEq. (1) applied for the solitary wave \u03a8(\u03c1, \u03be) and the\nground state \u03a80 (\u03c1), respectively. The presence of the\nchemical potential in Eq. (1) provides the compensation\nthat is necessary in order to compare energies of states\nwith the same number of particles. Similarly, the relevant \"physical\" momentum is not the linear momentum\nP of Eq. (2) but the \"impulse\" Q defined in a manner\nanalogous to the case of a homogeneous gas [6, 12]:\nZ\n\u2202\u03c6\nQ =\n(n \u2212 n0 )\ndV = P \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6\n(5)\n\u2202z\nZ \u221e\n2\u03c0\u03c1 d\u03c1 n0 (\u03c1)[\u03c6(\u03c1, z = \u221e) \u2212 \u03c6(\u03c1, z = \u2212\u221e)] ,\n\u03b4\u03c6 \u2261\n\nI\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\nQ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nFIG. 3: Energy E in units of \u03b3\u22a5 (h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 ) versus impulse Q in\nunits of \u03b3\u22a5 (h\u0304/a\u22a5 ). The solid line corresponds to the main sequence of solitary waves discussed in the text, and the dashed\nline to the auxiliary sequence that contains a black soliton\n(point IV).\n\nFig. 3 was calculated on the basis of the sequence of solitary waves with velocities in the range \u2212v0 < v < c. The\nbranch for \u2212c < v < v0 may be thought to correspond\nto negative Q, as usual. However, there is an implicit\n2\u03c0 periodicity because of the appearance of the angle \u03c6\nin the definition of the impulse in Eq. (5). Therefore,\na more natural representation of the spectrum seems to\nbe obtained by restricting Q to the \"first Brillouin zone\"\nand thus completing Fig. 3 by its mirror image around\nQ = \u03c0.\nWe have also carried out a detailed numerical calculation of the Bogoliubov dispersion for comparison.\nBut the main point can be made here by assuming the\nmodel dispersion \u03c9 = |q|(c2 + q 2 /4)1/2 where the frequency \u03c9 is measured in units of \u03c9\u22a5 and the wave number q in units of 1/a\u22a5. Translated into the units employed in Fig. 3, the model Bogoliubov dispersion reads\n2 2\n2\n\u2248 106\nQ /4)1/2 where a huge factor \u03b3\u22a5\nE = |Q|(c2 + \u03b3\u22a5\nmakes its appearance. Therefore, although the Bogoliubov and Lieb dispersions coincide at low Q, they diverge\nquickly at the scale of Fig. 3, a notable difference from the\nhomogeneous 1D model [2, 6]. In other words, the two\nmodes operate at rather different energy and momentum\nscales in a cylindrical trap.\nThe last question we address is whether or not there\nexists an independent sequence of solitary waves that reduces to a black soliton at v = 0. We used a model blacksoliton configuration as input in our iterative algorithm\nwhich converged to the true static soliton illustrated in\nframe IV of Fig. 2 that is indeed a black soliton. We\nthen incremented the velocity to either positive or negative values with symmetrical results. For definiteness,\nwe follow the solution to negative v and find that it ex-\n\n\f4\nists only until one encounters the same critical velocity\n\u2212v0 discussed earlier in the text. The corresponding terminal state is precisely the same with the one reached\nthrough our original sequence of solitary waves and illustrated in frame III of Fig. 2. For intermediate values of\nv the solution is again a vortex ring with constant radius\nat R = Rmin \u2248 0.8. Accordingly, the calculated energymomentum dispersion shown by a dashed line in Fig. 3\njoins the original sequence through a cusp at the terminal\npoint III, a situation that is reminiscent of the calculation\nof Jones and Roberts [12]. The same authors together\nwith Putterman later argued [20] that the solitary waves\nthat correspond to the upper branch are actually unstable, a conclusion that might be valid in the present case\nas well.\nA summary view of our results is given in Fig. 4. We\nhave thus constructed a family of solitary waves which\nexhibit some quasi-1D features, such as the appearance\nof a nontrivial phase difference \u03b4\u03c6 that is important for\nphase engineering [7, 8], but are otherwise bonafide 3D\nvortex rings.\n\nFIG. 4: Contour levels of the local particle density n in a\nplane that contains the z axis and cuts across the cylindrical\ntrap.

The\nfour special cases considered are the same as in Fig. 2.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\nE.H. Lieb and W. Liniger, Phys. Rev. 130, 1605 (1963).\nE.H. Lieb, Phys.
