These are pairs (A, \u03a6) of the gauge field A = Aa dxa\nand the Higgs field \u03a6 in a three-dimensional flat space satisfying the Bogomolny equation\nF = \u2212 \u2217 D\u03a6, which in components reads\n\u2202a Ab \u2212 \u2202b Aa \u2212 i[Aa , Ab ] = \u2212\u01ebabc (\u2202c \u03a6 \u2212 i[Ac , \u03a6]).\n\n(1)\n\nThe fields (A, \u03a6) are everywhere regular with the exception of a number of specified points\n{~pj }. At ~pj the fields have a Dirac singularity of a given charge ej imbedded in the gauge\ngroup, i.e. the fields approach those of the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive (GNO) monopoles of [3].\nTo be more specific, there is a gauge in which \u03a6(~x) = ej 2|~xB\u2212~pj | + O(1), where B is an element\nof the Lie algebra of the gauge group, satisfying exp(2\u03c0iB) = 1. We call such a singularity\nminimal if there is no 0 < \u03bc < 1 such that exp(2\u03c0i\u03bcB) = 1 and if ej = \u22121 or 1.\nWe shall focus in this paper on the case of a single nonabelian monopole with one or\ntwo minimal singularities. The exact definition of the nonabelian charge, as given in [4],\ncorresponds to an intuitive notion of the charge. Namely, for a charge one configuration,\nwhenever the distance between the monopole and the singularities is large we expect the\nfields in the vicinity of the monopole to be well approximated by the BPS 't Hooft-Polyakov\nsolution [5, 6, 2] and the fields near each singularity to be approximated by the Dirac-GNO\nsolution.\nThe main result of this paper is the set of Eqs. (15, 16, 17) expressing the fields of the\none U(2) monopole with two oppositely charged singularities. It is derived using the Nahm\ntransform techniques [7, 8].\nIn Section 2 we outline the Nahm data and the Nahm transform for singular monopoles.\nIn Section 3 we specify the Nahm data for the charge one case and use the Nahm transform\nto derive the U(2) solution. Exploring various limits of this configuration in Section 4 we also\nobtain the following solutions:\n1. a U(2) monopole with two minimal singularities of any charge sign: Eqs. (18, 17),\n2. an SO(3) monopole with two minimal singularities: Eqs. (19, 17),\n3. a U(2) monopole with one minimal singularity: Eqs. (20, 21),\n4. an SO(3) monopole with one minimal singularity: Eqs. (19, 21),\n\n1\n\n\f5. an SU(2) monopole with one minimal singularity: Eqs. (24, 25).\nWe conclude with a brief discussion of our results in Section 5.\n\n2\n\nNahm Transform\n\nThe Nahm data for singular monopoles is described in detail in [10]. For a nonabelian charge\nk U(2) monopole with k positively charged singularities and k negatively charges ones, the\nNahm data consists of two 2k-dimensional vectors Q\u2212\u03bb and Q\u03bb and four Hermitian k\u00d7k Nahm\nmatrices T0 (s), T1 (s), T2 (s), and T3 (s) defined on the intervals (\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03bb), (\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb), and (\u03bb, +\u221e)\nwith regular limiting behavior at the boundaries of the corresponding intervals. We shall often\ncombine the last three of the Nahm matrices into a vector T~ (s) = (T1 (s), T2 (s), T3 (s)). The\nNahm equations for the quadruplet (T0 (s), T1 (s), T2 (s), T3 (s)) of the rank k Hermitian matrix\nvalued functions read\nd\nTl \u2212 i[T0 , Ta ] + i\u01ebabc Tb Tc = 0,\n(2)\nds\nwhere each of a, b, and c run over the values 1, 2 or 3, and the summation over b and c is\nimplied. The Nahm quadruplet (T0 , T~ ) transforms under a U(k) valued gauge transformation\n!\n\u22121\ng\n(\u03bb\n)\n0\n\u03b1\nQ\u03bb\u03b1 . We can\ng(s) as (T0 , T~ ) 7\u2192 (g \u22121T0 g +ig \u22121dg, g \u22121T~ g), while Q\u03bb\u03b1 7\u2192\n0\ng \u22121(\u03bb\u03b1 )\nunderstand the Q's to be two-spinors in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.\nThe matching conditions at the points s = \u03bb\u03b1 (with \u03bb1 = \u2212\u03bb and \u03bb2 = \u03bb) are the same as in\n[11] and can be written as:\n1\nTb (\u03bb\u03b1 +) \u2212 Tb (\u03bb\u03b1 \u2212) = \u2212 tr2\u00d72 Q\u03bb\u03b1 Q\u2020\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c3b ,\n(3)\n2\nwhere tr2\u00d72 is the trace in the 2-dimensional spinor space only.\nGiven the Nahm data satisfying the Nahm equations and the matching conditions (3) for\nany three-vector ~x, we construct the Weyl operator D\n/ defined by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u0010\n\u0011\nd\n~\n1\u2297( ds \u2212 iT0 ) \u2212 ~\u03c3 \u2297(T \u2212 ~x) \u03c1(s)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\n(4)\nD\u03c1(s)\n/\n=\uf8ed\nQ\u2020\u2212\u03bb \u03c1(\u2212\u03bb)\n\uf8f8\nQ\u2020\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)\n\nHere \u03c1(s) is a fundamental two-component spinor-valued section continuous on the real line.\nThe crucial observation behind the Nahm transform is that the Nahm equations together with\nthe matching conditions are equivalent to\n\u0010\u0010 d\n\u00112\n\u0011\nD\n/ \u2020D\n/ = 1\u2297\n\u2212 iT0 + T12 + T22 + T32 ,\n(5)\nds\n2\n\n\fand that thus D\n/ \u2020D\n/ is strictly negative and\n! commutes with the Pauli\n! \u03c3-matrices.\n\u03c8\n\u03c7\u2212\u03bb\nThe dual Weyl equation is D\n/\u2020\n= 0, where \u03c7 =\n, reads\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\u03bb\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010d\n\u2212 iT0 + ~\u03c3 \u2297(T~ \u2212 ~x) \u03c8 + \u03b4(s + \u03bb)Q\u2212\u03bb \u03c7\u2212\u03bb + \u03b4(s \u2212 \u03bb)Q\u03bb \u03c7\u03bb = 0.\n(6)\n1\u2297\nds\n!\n\u03c8\nFrom now on let us denote by\na matrix with columns being the linearly independent\n\u03c7\nsolutions of the dual Weyl equation (6). There are two square integrable linearly independent\nR\nsolutions of Eq. (6). These can be orthonormalized imposing the condition \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8ds + \u03c7\u2020 \u03c7 =\nI2\u00d72 . The monopole fields are then given by\nZ \u221e\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03a6 = \u03bb(\u03c7\u03bb \u03c7\u03bb \u2212 \u03c7\u2212\u03bb \u03c7\u2212\u03bb ) +\n\u03c8 \u2020 s\u03c8ds,\n(7)\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2202\n\u2020 \u2202\n\u03c7+i\n(8)\n\u03c8 \u2020 j \u03c8ds.\nAj = i\u03c7\nj\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0010\n\nOne can note that the rank of the monopole fields is equal to the number of independent\nsolutions of Eq. (6).\nFor the purposes of this paper we can restrict ourselves to the Abelian Nahm data only. In\nother words, we have k = 1 and, once T0 (s) is gauge transformed to zero, the Nahm equations\nimply that the Nahm matrices T~ are constant on each interval.\n\n3\n\nOne U(2) Monopole with Two Oppositely Charged\nSingularities\n\nIn this section we investigate a monopole solution with a negative charge Dirac singularity\nat ~p1 , a positive charge Dirac singularity at ~p2 , and the monopole position parameter m.\n~ We\ndenote the relative positions by d~1 = m\n~ \u2212 ~p1 and d~2 = m\n~ \u2212 p~2 . For an observation point ~x we\ndenote its position with respect to the singularities by ~z1 = ~x \u2212 ~p1 and ~z2 = ~x \u2212 p~2 , and its\nposition with respect to the monopole by ~r = ~x \u2212 m.\n~ We also let z\u03b1 = |~z\u03b1 | and d\u03b1 = |d~\u03b1 | for\n\u03b1 = 1, 2.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, we have k = 1. We choose a gauge in which T0\nvanishes, then the Nahm equations imply that the Nahm matrices T~ are 1 \u00d7 1 and that they\nare constant on each interval. In particular, to produce the monopole specified above, we\n\n3\n\n\fhave\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 p~1 for s < \u2212\u03bb,\nT~ =\nm\n~ for \u2212 \u03bb < s < \u03bb,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n~p2 for s > \u03bb,\n\n(9)\n\nand the matching conditions (3) become 2d~1 = \u2212Q\u2020\u2212\u03bb~\u03c3 Q\u2212\u03bb and 2d~2 = Q\u2020\u03bb~\u03c3 Q\u03bb . At this\npoint it is convenient to introduce Weyl spinors Q1\u00b1 and Q2\u00b1 determined by the relations\nQ\u2020\u03b1\u00b1 Q\u03b1\u00b1 = d\u03b1 \u00b1~\u03c3 * d~\u03b1 for \u03b1 = 1, 2. We have Q\u2020\u03b1\u00b1 Q\u03b1\u2213 = 0. Also note that these Q's are defined\nup to a phase factor. This arbitrariness corresponds to some of the gauge freedom of the final\nmonopole solution. Now the solutions of the matching conditions are provided by Q\u2212\u03bb = Q1\u2212\nand Q\u03bb = Q2+ .\nSolving the dual Weyl equation is straightforward once we introduce the spinors \u03b6\u03b1\u00b1 for\n\u2020\n\u03b1 = 1, 2 defined by the relations \u03b6\u03b1\u00b1\n\u03b6\u03b1\u00b1 = z\u03b1 \u00b1 ~\u03c3 * ~z\u03b1 . The solution to Eq. (6) then takes the\nform\n\uf8f1\n\u03b61+ Q\u2020\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ne~\u03c3*~z1 (s+\u03bb) Q\u2020 \u03b61+ e\u2212~\u03c3*~r\u03bb N for s < \u2212\u03bb\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n1+ 1+\n~\n\u03c3 *~\nrs\n(10)\n\u03c8(s) =\ne N\nfor \u2212 \u03bb < s < \u03bb ,\n\uf8f4\n\u2020\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 e~\u03c3*~z2 (s\u2212\u03bb) \u03b62\u2212 Q2\u2212 e~\u03c3*~r\u03bb N for s > \u03bb,\nQ\u20202\u2212 \u03b62\u2212\n\n\u03c7\u2212\u03bb =\n\u03c7\u03bb =\n\n\u2020\n\u03b61\u2212\n\n\u2020\n\u03b61\u2212\nQ1\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\ne\u2212~\u03c3*~r\u03bb N,\n\n(11)\n\ne~\u03c3*~r\u03bb N.\n\n(12)\n\n\u2020\n\u03b62+\n\u2020\nQ2+\n\u03b62+\n\nThe matrix N is independent of the variable s.

The\n't Hooft operators are the disorder parameter fields of the QCD and the behavior of their\nGreen's functions has direct bearing on the question of confinement. The leading classical\nterms of these Green's functions is delivered by the classical tension of the Dirac string.\nThe monopole configuration described here provides one of the nonperturbative corrections\ncontributing, for example, at finite temperature as well as at the finite volume. Lifting the two\nsingularity SO(3) solution of Eqs. (19,17) to a configuration in the SU(2) gauge theory results\nin a configuration containing a physical Dirac string connecting the two singular points. From\nthe four-dimensional point of view it describes a nonabelian monopole in SU(2) in the presence\nof two world-lines of the Dirac singularities. The Dirac monopoles are the genuine 't Hooft\nline operator in the original sense of [14], and the world-sheet of the Dirac string connecting\nthem signifies a physical interface between the two vacua related by the Z2 symmetry of the\ncenter of the gauge group.\nThe significance of 't Hooft operators for the Montonen-Olive duality [15] is elucidated\nin [16] where they emerge as S-dual partners of the Wilson-Polyakov operators. 't Hooft\noperators also play significant role as Hecke operators in the supersymmetric gauge theory\nrealization of the Langlands duality [17].\nThe screening effects of the singularities by the monopole are also of interest. It is akin\nto the instanton bubbling effect. In [12] we demonstrate that a U(2) monopole cannot completely screen a single minimal singularity, however, we find that it can screen completely two\ncoinciding singularities of opposite charge. Solutions presented in this paper provide a continuous family interpolating these two extreme cases. It would be interesting to explore the\n'partial screening' of a pair of closely positioned singularities. One can use such screening to\ndefine 't Hooft-like operators localized in space-time. Namely, if a pair of coinciding 't Hooft\noperators can be screened by a monopole, one can also create such a pair and a monopole by\nmoving the monopole away at some time ti and then rejoin the monopole and the singularity\nat a later time tf . In between ti and tf one can also separate the two singularities from each\nother at t1 and rejoin them again at t2 > t1 > ti , thus creating a conventional 't Hooft loop\nbetween the times t1 and t2 within the monopole-singulatiry loop.\nOur last comment is regarding the moduli spaces of these monopoles. All the monopoles\ndiscussed here have a four dimensional moduli space. The four coordinates on this space are\n7\n\n\fgiven by the position of the monopole in the three-dimensional space and its phase in the\ngauge group. As discussed in [4] the moduli space of one U(2) monopole with two minimal\nsingularities is a two-centered Taub-NUT space. (Same holds for the SO(3) monopole with\ntwo singularities.) Thus, following the logic of [18, 19], the low velocity scattering of this\nmonopole off a pair of singularities is given by a geodesic motion on the two-centered TaubNUT.\nThe moduli space of one U(2) or SO(3) monopole with a single singularity is the TaubNUT space. The moduli space of one SU(2) monopole with one singularity is a degenerate\nTaub-NUT space, which can be viewed as Taub-NUT/Z2 .\n\nAcknowledgments\nBD is supported by the Irish Research Council for Science Engineering and Technology:\nfunded by the National Development Plan.
