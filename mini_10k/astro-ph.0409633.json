Here we recall the basics of the mirror matter theory and the\nmain results of previous Paper I.\nMirror matter is an ideal stable dark matter candidate. The basic concept is to have\na hidden mirror (M) sector of the Universe which has exactly the same particles and\ninteractions of our observable (O) sector.1 The theory asserts that a discrete symmetry P (G \u2194 G\u2032 ) interchanging corresponding fields of G and G\u2032 , so-called mirror parity,\nguarantees that both particle sectors are described by the same Lagrangians2 , with all\ncoupling constants (gauge, Yukawa, Higgs) having the same pattern, so that their micro1\n\nFrom now on all fields and quantities of the mirror sector will have an apex to distinguish them from\nthe ones belonging to the observable or ordinary world.\n2\nIn the brane world picture, the M sector can be the same O world realized on a parallel brane.\n\n1\n\n\fphysics is the same3 [3, 4]. Thus, mirror particles are stable exactly as their ordinary\ncounterparts. In addition, two sectors communicate with each other essentially through\ngravity. Indeed, they could communicate perhaps also via some other messengers4 [5], but\nthey are controlled by free parameters, that we can choose small enough to neglect these\ninteractions.\nMany people were interested in mirror world over last years, in particular being motivated by the problems of neutrino physics [6], gravitational microlensing [7], gamma ray\nbursts [8], flavour and CP violation [9] large scale structure of the Universe [10, 11], galaxy\nformation [12], orthopositronium lifetime [13, 14], dark matter detection experiments [15],\nanomalous events within the solar system [16, 17, 18], extrasolar planets [19].\nThen, if the mirror hypothesis is verified, the Universe contains, besides the particles\nof the ordinary sector, also their partners in the mirror sector. However, the fact that\nthere are the same particles and interactions in both sectors does not mean that also\ntheir cosmological densities are the same. In fact, two sectors could have different initial\nconditions, and this is exactly what is required in order to avoid a conflict with the Big\nBang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bounds on the effective number of extra light neutrino species.\nIn particular, the BBN bounds imply that the M sector has a temperature lower than the\nO one, with a ratio x = T \u2032 /T < 0.64 [20]. We remark that the sensitivity of this limit\nto the factor x is very low, so that also values x < 0.7 could be considered. In order to\nobtain this situation, the following conditions must be satisfied:\nA. After the Big Bang the two systems are born with different temperatures, namely\nthe post-inflationary reheating temperature in the M sector is lower than in the visible\none, TR\u2032 < TR . This can be naturally achieved in certain models [21].\nB. The two systems interact very weakly, so that they do not come into thermal\nequilibrium with each other after reheating. This condition is automatically fulfilled if\nthe two worlds communicate only via gravity. If there are some other effective couplings\nbetween the O and M particles, they have to be properly suppressed.\nC. Both systems expand adiabatically, without significant entropy production. If the\ntwo sectors have different reheating temperatures, during the expansion of the Universe\nthey evolve independently, their temperatures remain different at later stages, T \u2032 < T , and\nthe presence of the M sector would not affect primordial nucleosynthesis in the ordinary\nworld.\nAs shown in previous papers [1, 11, 20], due to the temperature difference between the\ntwo sectors, the key epochs for structure formation take place at different redshifts, and\nin particular they happens in the M sector before than in the O one. We define the two\nfree parameters describing the mirror world as:\nx=\n\nT\u2032\n< 0.64\nT \u223c\n\n\u03b2=\n\n\u03a9\u2032b\n>1,\n\u03a9b \u223c\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the first limit comes from the aforementioned BBN bounds, while the second one\nfrom the hypothesis that mirror matter could constitute an important fraction of dark\nmatter in the Universe. This latter assumption is supported by various baryogenesis\nscenarios with a hidden sector [22], all obtaining a mirror baryonic density at least equal\nto the ordinary one.\n3\n\nThere is the possibility that the mirror parity could be spontaneously broken and the weak interaction\nscales h\u03c6i = v and h\u03c6\u2032 i = v \u2032 could be different, leading to somewhat different particle physics in the mirror\nsector [2]. In this paper we consider only the case v = v \u2032 , where the physics is the same in both sectors.\n4\nThe possible non-gravitational interactions include photon\u2013mirror-photon kinetic mixing, neutrino\u2013\nmirror-neutrino mass mixing, and Higgs-boson\u2013mirror-Higgs-boson mixing.\n\n2\n\n\fThen, in a so-called Mirror Universe (a misleading expression indicating a Universe\nmade of two sectors, ordinary and mirror) the radiation and matter components are expressed in general by\n\u03a9r = (\u03a9r )O + (\u03a9r )M = (\u03a9r )O (1 + x4 ) = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 h\u22122 (1 + x4 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the additional term x4 takes into account the temperature difference between two\nsectors and is very low in view of the bound (1), and\n\u03a9m = \u03a9b + \u03a9\u2032b + \u03a9CDM = \u03a9b (1 + \u03b2) + \u03a9CDM ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a9\u2032b is the contribution of mirror baryonic dark matter (MBDM) to the density.\nThe relevant epochs for structure formation are matter-radiation equality (MRE),\nmatter-radiation decoupling (MRD) and photon-baryon equipartition, respectively represented by the redshifts:\n1 + zeq =\n\n\u03a9m h2\n\u03a9m\n\u2248 2.4 * 104\n,\n\u03a9r\n1 + x4\n\n\u2032\n1 + zdec\n\u2243 x\u22121 (1 + zdec ) \u2243 1.1 * 103 x\u22121 ,\n\u2032\n1 + zb\u03b3\n=\n\n\u03a9b \u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03a9\u2032b\n\u2243\n= (1 + zb\u03b3 ) 4 > 1 + zb\u03b3 .\n\u2032\n4\n\u03a9\u03b3\n\u03a9\u03b3 x\nx\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nEq. (4) means that the MRE in a Mirror Universe occurs always later than in an ordinary\none, while from eqs. (5) and (6) we know that decoupling and equipartition in the M sector\nhappen before than in the O one. If we plot the redshifts of MRE and mirror MRD as\nfunctions of x, as in fig. 1 of ref. [1], we obtain their intersection for a value xeq expressed\nby\nxeq \u2248 0.046(\u03a9m h2 )\u22121 .\n(7)\nThis means that for values x < xeq the mirror decoupling occurs in the radiation dominated\nperiod, with consequences on the structure formation process (see Paper I [1] and refs. [10,\n11, 20]). Using the value \u03a9m h2 = 0.135, appeared in a recent WMAP fit [23], we obtain\nthe typical value xeq \u2248 0.34.\nThis quantity has a key role in structure formation with mirror dark matter. In\nfact we know from the results of Paper I [1] and refs. [10, 11]) that for values x < xeq\nthe evolution of primordial perturbations in the linear regime is practically identical to\nthe standard CDM case. In the same paper we studied the relevant scales for structure\nformation, finding some interesting results: 1) the mirror Jeans mass MJ\u2032 is always smaller\nthan the ordinary one, thus making easier the growth of perturbations; 2) there exist the\ndissipative mirror Silk scale MS\u2032 (analogous to the Silk scale for ordinary baryons), that\nfor x \u223c xeq has the value of a typical galaxy mass; 3) for x < xeq we obtain MJ\u2032 \u223c MS\u2032 , so\nthat all the primordial perturbations with masses greater than the mirror Silk mass can\ngrow uninterruptedly.\nIn the last decade the study of the the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the\nLarge Scale Structure (LSS) is providing a great amount of observational data, and their\ncontinuous improvement provides powerful cosmological instruments that could help us to\nunderstand the nature of the dark matter of the Universe. In this context, the analysis\nof the CMB and LSS power spectra for a mirror baryonic dark matter scenario plays a\nkey role as a cosmological test of the mirror theory. This is exactly the aim of this paper,\nin which we computed these spectra for a large range of parameters, qualitatively studied\nthe consistence with present observational data, and obtained new useful limits on the\n3\n\n\fmirror parameter space, broadening our previous studies [11] with many new models and\na detailed analysis of their dependence on all the cosmological parameters.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In next section we briefly describe the computed\nmirror models and the procedure used to obtain the CMB and LSS spectra. In sections\n3 and 4 we show respectively the CMB and LSS power spectra for a MBDM scenario,\nand study their dependence on the mirror parameters, comparing with the CDM case.\nIn addition, we computed the spectrum of mirror CMB photons, comparing it with the\nanalogous for the ordinary sector, and we extended the LSS spectra also to smaller non\nlinear scales. Section 5 analyzes the dependence and the sensitivity of the CMB and\nLSS power spectra on the cosmological parameters; here we study different mirror models\nchanging one parameter each time. Section 6 is devoted to the comparison of mirror\npower spectra with current observations, that allows us to obtain some bound on the\nmirror parameter space. Finally, our main conclusions are summarized in section 7.\n\n2\n\nThe mirror models\n\nWe computed many models for Mirror Universe, assuming adiabatic scalar primordial\nperturbations, a flat space-time geometry, and different mixtures of ordinary and mirror\nbaryons, photons and massless neutrinos, cold dark matter, and cosmological constant.\nWe used the evolutionary equations in synchronous gauge5 described in ref. [24]. Since\nwe are working in the Fourier space k, all the k modes (where k is the comoving wavevector\nand k its magnitude) in the linearized Einstein, Boltzmann, and fluid equations evolve\nindependently; thus the equations can be solved for one value of k at a time. Moreover,\nall modes with the same k obey the same evolutionary equations.\nIn the same paper, the Boltzmann equations for massless neutrinos and photons have\nbeen transformed into an infinite hierarchy of moment equations Fl that must be truncated\nat some maximum multipole order lmax . Following the suggestions of authors, an improved\ntruncation scheme6 is based on extrapolating the behaviour of Fl to l = lmax + 1 as\nF(lmax +1) \u2248\n\n(2lmax + 1)\nFlmax \u2212 F(lmax \u22121) ,\nk\u03c4\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the conformal time. However, time-variations of the potentials during the\nradiation-dominated era make even equation (8) a poor approximation if lmax is chosen\ntoo small. Thus, in order to obtain a relative accuracy better than 10\u22123 in our final\nresults, in the computation of the potential and the density fields the photons and the\nmassless neutrinos phase space distributions for both the ordinary and mirror sectors\nwere expanded in Legendre series truncating the Boltzmann hierarchies at lmax = 2000,\nusing the truncation schemes given by the above expression (8) for massless neutrinos and\nequations (65) of ref. [24] for photons.\nWe integrated in this way the equations of motion numerically over the range \u22125.0 \u2264\nlog k \u2264 \u22120.5 (where k is measured in Mpc\u22121 ) using points evenly spaced with an interval\nof \u2206 log k = 0.01. For purposes of computing the LSS power spectra for larger (non linear)\n5\n\nThe difference in the use of other gauges is limited to the gauge-dependent behaviour of the density\nfluctuations on scales larger than the horizon. The fluctuations can appear as growing modes in one\ncoordinate system and as constant mode in another, as shown in ref. [24] for the synchronous and the\nconformal Newtonian gauges.\n6\nOne simple method is to set Fl = 0 for l > lmax , but it is inaccurate. The authors affirmed that the\nproblem with this scheme is the coupling of multipoles in equations, that leads to the propagation of errors\nfrom lmax to smaller l. These errors can propagate to l = 0 in a time \u03c4 \u2248 lmax /k and then reflect back to\nincreasing l, leading to amplification of errors in the interval 0 \u2264 l \u2264 lmax [24].\n\n4\n\n\fscales (see \u00a7 4.1) we extended the integration of some models as far as log k = 1.0. All the\nintegrations were carried to the redshift z = 0.\nThe numerical computations were made using a Fortran code that solves the cited\nequations. We took a pre-existent program written for a standard Universe, made only\nof the ordinary sector, and then we modified the code in order to simulate a Mirror\nUniverse, which has a second sector. This required to modify and add several subroutines\nto the code. In fact we are dealing now with two self-interacting sectors, and thus all the\nequations governing the evolution of the considered components, relativistic (photons and\nmassless neutrinos) and non relativistic (baryons), must be doubled. The cold dark matter\nequations were not doubled because they have the same physical effects independently of\nthe sector. In addition, the two sectors communicate via gravity, so that they are coupled\nand influence each other through this interaction. Therefore, there are more regimes than\nin the standard case, because now they are made up of the couplings between the different\nordinary and mirror regimes, the latter being time-shifted from the former according to\nthe laws exposed in previous section.\nAt last, we normalized our results to the COBE data, following the procedure described\nby Bunn and White in 1997 [25].\nParameter\n\u03a9m\n\u03c9b\n\u03c9b\u2032\nx\nh\nn\n\nmin. value\n0.1\n0.010\n0.0\n0.1\n0.5\n0.90\n\nmax. value\n0.5\n0.030\n\u03c9m \u2212 \u03c9b\n0.7\n0.9\n1.10\n\nTable 1: Parameters and their ranges used in mirror models. The values are not evenly spaced,\nbut arbitrarily chosen in the parameter space. Not listed there are the total and vacuum densities,\nwhich, being flat models, are \u03a90 = 1 and \u03a9\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m .\n\nFor the mirror models, we considered different values of the cosmological parameters,\nwhere we add to the usual ones two new mirror parameters: the ratio of the temperatures\nin the two sectors x = T \u2032 /T and the mirror baryons density \u03a9\u2032b = \u03b2\u03a9b (also expressed\nvia the ratio \u03b2 of the baryonic densities in the two sectors). Starting from an ordinary\nreference model, we study the influence of the mirror sector varying the two parameters\nthat describe it for a given ordinary sector, replacing a fraction of CDM (or the entire\ndark matter) with MBDM. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of the cosmological\nparameters for a mirror baryonic dark matter scenario, changing all of them. The values\nused for the parameters are not on a regular grid, but arbitrarily chosen for the only\npurpose to better understand the CMB and LSS for a Mirror Universe. At present we\nare not able to make a grid thin enough to perform a fit of all free parameters (even if we\nfix some of them) for two reasons: first, we have two further parameters, which lengthen\na lot the computational time (by a factor order 102 ), and second our program is much\nslower than the ones commonly used for a standard Universe, because our models are\nmore complicated in terms of calculus and for our choice to privilege precision instead of\nperformance (at least at this stage7 ). We list the parameters used and their ranges in\n7\n\nThe aim of this paper is not a fit of the parameters, but a study of some cosmological observables\nin a MBDM scenario, and possibly a qualitative test of the mirror theory. After this work, a future step\ncould be just to write a new program much faster than the one here used, which should allow us to fit the\nparameters and compare the results with other cosmological models.\n\n5\n\n\ftable 1; the total and vacuum densities (not listed in the table) are fixed by our choice of\na flat geometry: \u03a90 = 1 and \u03a9\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m . In addition, in order to study the parameter\ndependence, we computed models also for different numbers of extra-neutrino species\n(\u2206N\u03bd = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5).\n\n3\n\nThe cosmic microwave background for a Mirror Universe\n\nAs anticipated when we studied the structure formation in Paper I [1] (and predicted or\nshown in refs. [10, 11, 20]), we expect that the existence of a mirror sector influences\nthe cosmic microwave background radiation observable today; in this section we want to\nevaluate this effect.\nWe choose a starting standard model and add a mirror sector simply removing cold\ndark matter and adding mirror baryons. The values of the parameters for this reference\nmodel are: \u03a90 = 1, \u03a9m = 0.30, \u03a9\u039b = 0.70, \u03c9b = \u03a9b h2 = 0.02, n = 1.00, h = 0.70, with\nonly cold dark matter (no massive neutrinos) and scalar adiabatic perturbations (with\nspectral index n). This reference model is not the result of a fit, but is arbitrarily chosen\nconsistent with the current knowledge of the cosmological parameters; however, this is\nnot a shortcoming, because here we want only to put in evidence the differences from a\nrepresentative reference model (without comparison with observations), and this is a good\nmodel for this intention.\nFrom this starting point, first of all we substitute all the cold dark matter with mirror\nbaryonic dark matter (MBDM) and evaluate the CMB angular power spectrum varying\nx from 0.3 to 0.7 (around the upper limit set by the BBN bounds). This is shown in top\npanel of figure 1, where mirror models are plotted together with the reference model. The\nfirst evidence is that the deviation from the standard model is not linear in x: it grows\nmore for bigger x and for x <\n\u223c 0.3 the power spectra are practically coincident. This is\nimportant, because it means that a Universe where all the dark matter is made of mirror\nbaryons could be indistinguishable from a CDM model if we analyze the CMB only. We\nsee the greatest separation from the reference model for x = 0.7, but it will increase for\nhypothetical larger values of x. The height of the first acoustic peak grows for x >\n\u223c 0.3,\nwhile the position remains nearly constant. For the second peak the opposite occurs, i.e.\nthe height remains practically constant, while the position shifts toward higher multipoles\nl; for the third peak, instead, we have a shift both in height and position (the absolute\nshifts are similar to the ones for the first two peaks, but the height now decreases instead\nof increasing). Observing also other peaks, we recognize a general pattern: except for the\nfirst one, odd peaks change both height and location, even ones change location only.\nIn bottom panel of figure 1 we show the intermediate case of a mixture of CDM and\nMBDM. We consider x = 0.7, a high value which permits us to see well the differences\nchanging \u03c9b\u2032 from \u03c9b to 4\u03c9b . The dependence on the amount of mirror baryons is lower\nthan on the ratio of temperatures x. In fact, the position of the first peak is nearly stable\nfor all mirror models (except for a very low increase of height for growing \u03c9b\u2032 ), while\ndifferences appear for other peaks. In the second peak the position is shifted as in the case\nwithout CDM independently of \u03c9b\u2032 , while the height is inversely proportional to \u03c9b\u2032 with\na separation appreciable for \u03c9b\u2032 <\n\u223c 3\u03c9b . For the third peak the behaviour is the same as\nfor the case without CDM, with a slightly stronger dependence on \u03c9b\u2032 , while for the other\npeaks there is a weaker dependence on \u03c9b\u2032 . A common feature is that the heights of the\npeaks are not linearly dependent on the mirror baryonic density, while their positions are\npractically insensitive to \u03c9b\u2032 but depend only on x.\nWe will analyze in more detail the x and \u03c9b\u2032 dependence of the peaks, together with\nother parameters, in \u00a7 5.\n6\n\n\f80\n\n\u03a9M=0.30, \u03c9b=0.020, h=0.70, n=1.00\n\n[l(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0]1/2\n\n(\u03bc\u039a)\n\nx=0.3, no CDM\nx=0.5, no CDM\nx=0.7, no CDM\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n80\n\nx=0.7, \u03c9b'=\u03c9b\nx=0.7, \u03c9b'=2\u03c9b\n\n[l(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0]1/2\n\n(\u03bc\u039a)\n\nx=0.7, \u03c9b'=3\u03c9b\nx=0.7, \u03c9b'=4\u03c9b\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\nl\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\nFigure 1: CMB angular power spectrum for different values of x and \u03c9b\u2032 = \u03a9\u2032b h2 , compared with a\nstandard model (solid line).

Nevertheless, its study is not only speculative, since it is\na way to better understand the cosmology with MBDM and our observable CMB.\n\n[l(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0]1/2 (\u03bc\u039a)\n\n100\n\nx = 0.9\n\nx = 0.7\n\nx = 0.5\n\nx = 0.3\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\n[l(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0]1/2 (\u03bc\u039a)\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nl\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nl\n\nFigure 2: Angular power spectra for ordinary (solid line) and mirror (dashed line) CMB photons.\nThe models have \u03a90 = 1, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03c9b = \u03c9b\u2032 = 0.02, h = 0.7, n = 1.0, and x = 0.9 (top-left panel),\nx = 0.7 (top-right panel), x = 0.5 (bottom-left panel), x = 0.3 (bottom-right panel).\nWe computed four models of mirror CMB, in order to have enough elements to compare\nwith the corresponding observable CMBs. The chosen parameter values are those usually\ntaken, and the amount of mirror baryons is the same as the ordinary ones, while x is taken\nas 0.9, 0.7, 0.5 or 0.3 in order to explore different scenarios. Thus the parameters of the\nmodels are: \u03a90 = 1, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03c9b = \u03c9b\u2032 = 0.02, x = 0.7 or 0.5, h = 0.7, n = 1.0. In\nfigure 2 we plot the ordinary and mirror CMB spectra corresponding to the same model\nof Mirror Universe.\nThe first evidence is that, being scaled by the factor x the temperatures in the two\nsectors, also their temperature fluctuations will be scaled by the same amount, as evident\nif we look at the lowest l values (the fluctuations seeds are the same for both sectors).\nStarting from the top-left panel of the figure, we see that the first mirror CMB peak is\nhigher and shifted to higher multipoles than the ordinary one, while other peaks are both\nlower and at higher l values, with a shift growing with the order of the peak.\n8\n\nIndeed, there is in principle the possibility that mirror CMB photons could influence our CMB photons\nin case of existence of a photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing [5], but its detection would not be possible\nwith present and probably even future experiments, given the very low estimates for the cross section of\nthis interaction.\n9\nSince two worlds have the same microphysics, the life should be possible also in the mirror sector!\n\n8\n\n\fObserving all the panels, we understand the effect of a change of the parameter x on\nthe mirror CMB: (i) for lower x-values the first peak is higher (for x = 0.5 it is nearly one\nand half the ordinary one); (ii) the position shifts to much higher multipoles (so that with\nthe same horizontal scale we can no more see some peaks). The reason is that a change\nof x corresponds to a change of the mirror decoupling time. The mirror photons, which\ndecouple before the ordinary ones, see a smaller sound horizon, scaled approximately by\nthe factor x; since the first peak occurs at a multipole l \u221d (sound horizon)\u22121 , we expect it\nto shifts to higher l-values by a factor x\u22121 , that is exactly what we observe in the figure.\nWe have verified that increasing x the mirror CMB is more and more similar to the\nordinary one, until for x = 1 (not shown in figure) the two power spectra are perfectly\ncoincident (as expected, since in this case the two sectors have exactly the same temperatures, the same particle contents, and then their photons power spectra are necessarily\nthe same).\nIf we were able to detect both the ordinary and mirror CMB photons, we had two\nsnapshots of the Universe at two different epochs, which were a powerful cosmological\ninstrument, but unfortunately this is impossible, because mirror photons are by definition\ncompletely invisible for us.\n\n4\n\nThe large scale structure for a Mirror Universe\n\nGiven the oscillatory behaviour of the mirror baryons (different from the smooth one of\ncold dark matter), we expect that MBDM induces specific signatures also on the large\nscale structure power spectrum.\nIn order to evaluate this effect, we computed LSS power spectra using the same reference and mirror models used in \u00a7 3 for the CMB analysis. The two panels of figure 3 show\nthe LSS for the same models as in figure 1. In order to remove the dependences of units\non the Hubble constant, we plot on the x-axis the wave number in units of h and on the\ny-axis the power spectrum in units of h3 . The minimum scale (the maximum k) plotted\nis placed around the limit of the linear regime.\nIn top panel of the figure we show the dependence on x for different mirror models\nwithout CDM; in this case, where all the dark matter is made of mirror baryons, the\noscillatory effect is obviously maximum. The first evidence is the strong dependence on x\nof the beginning of oscillations: it goes to higher scales for higher x, and below x \u2243 0.3\nthe power spectrum for a Mirror Universe approaches more and more the CDM one. This\nbehaviour is a consequence of the x-dependence of the mirror Silk scale, that increases for\ngrowing x (for details see Paper I [1] and refs. [10, 11, 20]): this dissipative scale induces\na cutoff in the power spectrum, which is damped with an oscillatory behaviour (it will be\nmore evident in figures 4 and 5, where we extend our models to smaller scales within the\nnon linear region). Oscillations begin at the same time of the damping, and they are so\ndeep (because there are many mirror baryons) to go outside the coordinate box. In any\ncase the mirror spectra are always below the ordinary one for every value of x.\nThe dependence on the amount of mirror baryons is instead shown in the bottom panel\nof the figure, where only a fraction of the dark matter is made of mirror baryons, while the\nrest is CDM. Contrary to the CMB case, the matter power spectrum strongly depends on\n\u03c9b\u2032 . The oscillations are deeper for increasing mirror baryon densities and the spectrum\ngoes more and more away from the pure CDM one. We note also that the damping begins\nalways at the same scale, and thus it depends only on x and not on \u03c9b\u2032 , as we know from\nthe expression of the mirror Silk scale obtained in Paper I [1] and refs.

Obviously, since our treatment is based on the linear theory,\nit is no longer valid in non linear regime. Nevertheless, even if it cannot be used for a\ncomparison with observations, the extension of our models to these scales is very useful\nto understand the behaviour of the power spectrum in a mirror baryonic dark matter\nscenario, in particular concerning the position of the cutoff (we recall that its presence\ncould help in avoiding the problem of the CDM scenario with the excessive number of\nsmall structures).\nTherefore, in figures 4 and 5 we extend the power spectra up to k/h = 10 Mpc\u22121\n(corresponding to galactic scales), well beyond the limit of the linear regime, given approximately by k/h < 0.4 Mpc\u22121 .\nIn figure 4 we plot in both panels the same models as in figure 3. For comparison we\nshow also a standard model characterized by a matter density made almost completely of\nCDM, with only a small contamination of baryons (\u03a9b \u2243 0.2% instead of \u2243 4% of other\nmodels). In the top panel, the x-dependence of the mirror power spectra is considered:\nthe vertical scale extends to much lower values compared to figure 3, and we can clearly\nsee the deep oscillations, but in particular it is evident the presence of the previously\ncited cutoff. For larger values of x oscillations begin earlier and cutoff moves to higher\nscales. Moreover, note that the model with almost all CDM has more power than the same\nstandard model with baryons, which in turn has more power than all mirror models for\nany x and for all the scales. In the bottom panel we show the dependence on the mirror\nbaryon content. It is remarkable that all mirror models stop to oscillate at some low scale\nand then continue with a smooth CDM-like trend. This means that, after the cutoff due\nto mirror baryons, the dominant behaviour is the one characteristic of cold dark matter\nmodels (due to the lack of a cutoff for CDM). Clearly, for higher mirror baryon densities\nthe oscillations continue down to smaller scales, but, contrary to the previous case, where\nall the dark matter was mirror baryonic, there will always be a scale below which the\nspectrum is CDM-like.\nAn interesting point of the mirror baryonic scenario is his capability to mimic a CDM\nscenario under certain circumstances and for certain measurements. To explain this point,\nin figure 5 we show models with low x-values (0.2 or 0.1) and all dark matter made of\nMBDM; we see that for x = 0.2 the standard and mirror power spectra are already\npractically coincident in the linear region. If we go down to x = 0.1 the coincidence is\nextended up to k/h \u223c 1 Mpc\u22121 . In principle, we could still decrease x and lengthen\nthis region of equivalence between the different CDM and MBDM models, but we have\nto remember that we are dealing with linear models extended to non linear scales, then\nneglecting all the non linear phenomena (such as merging or stellar feedback), that are\nvery different for the CDM and the MBDM scenarios. In the same plot we also considered\na model with x = 0.2 and dark matter composed equally by mirror baryons and CDM.\nThis model shows that in principle it's possible a tuning of the cutoff effect reducing the\namount of mirror matter, in order to better reproduce the cutoff needed to explain, for\nexample, the low number of small satellites in galaxies.\nThis work provided for us the linear transfer functions, which constitute the principal\n\n11\n\n\f104\n\nP(k)h3 (Mpc3)\n\n102\n100\n10-2\n10-4\n10-6\n\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.001,h=0.70,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,x=0.3,no CDM,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,x=0.5,no CDM,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,x=0.7,no CDM,n=1.00\n\n104\n\nP(k)h3 (Mpc3)\n\n102\n100\n10-2\n10-4\n10-6\n\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.001,h=0.70,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,x=0.7,\u03c9b'=\u03c9b,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,x=0.7,\u03c9b'=2\u03c9b,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,x=0.7,\u03c9b'=3\u03c9b,n=1.00\n\u03a9M=0.30,\u03c9b=0.02,h=0.70,x=0.7,\u03c9b'=4\u03c9b,n=1.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\nk/h (Mpc\u22121)\n\n1.0\n\n10\n\nFigure 4: LSS power spectrum beyond the linear regime for different values of x and \u03c9b\u2032 = \u03a9\u2032b h2 ,\ncompared with a standard model (solid line).

Furthermore\nthe details of the features in these power spectra depend critically on the chosen cosmological parameters and on the composition of the Universe, which in turn can be accurately\ndetermined by precise measurements of these patterns. In this section we briefly discuss\nthe sensitivity of the Cl 's and P (k)'s on the values of some fundamental parameters in a\nmirror baryonic scenario.\nIn particular, the exact form of the CMB and LSS power spectra is greatly dependent\non assumptions about the matter content of the Universe. Apart from the total density\nparameter \u03a90 (our models are flat, so \u03a90 is always 1), the composition of the Universe\ncan be parametrized by its components \u03a9m and \u03a9\u039b , and the components of the matter\ndensity \u03a9b , \u03a9\u2032b , \u03a9CDM . Further parameters are the tilt of scalar fluctuations n, the Hubble\nparameter h, and the ratio of temperatures in the two sectors x. In addition, we consider\nalso the dependence on the number of massless neutrino species N\u03bd , in order to compare\nit with the x-dependence. This is important if we remember that the relativistic mirror\nparticles can be parametrized in terms of effective number of extra-neutrino species (for\ndetails see ref. [20]).\nStarting from the reference model of parameters \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03c9b = \u03c9b\u2032 = 0.02, x = 0.2,\nh = 0.7 and n = 1.0, we change one parameter each time, compute the respective models,\nand plot the CMB and LSS power spectra in order to show the dependence on it (figures\n6 - 13). Then, we compute the relative locations and heights of the first three acoustic\n13\n\n\fpeaks of the CMB angular power spectrum and plot them in figures 14 and 15 in order to\ncompare their sensitivities to the parameters.\nIn the following we briefly analyze the dependences on every parameter, referring to\nthe figure where the respective models are plotted.\n\u2022 Matter density (fig. 6): \u03a9m varies from 0.1 to 0.5. In flat models a decrease in\n\u03a9m implies two things: an increase in \u03a9\u039b (with the consequent delay in matterradiation equality) and a decrease in \u03a9CDM (if we leave unchanged the O and M\nbaryon densities). Both these things correspond to boosting and shifting effects on\nthe acoustic peaks, while the matter power spectrum goes down, given the decreasing\nof the density of the collisionless species (CDM) and the progressive relative growth\nof the baryon densities, which are responsible for the oscillatory features.\n\u2022 O baryon density (fig. 7): \u03c9b = \u03c9b\u2032 varies from 0.01 to 0.03. An increase of the\nbaryon fraction increases odd peaks (compression phase of the baryon-photon fluid)\ndue to extra-gravity from baryons with respect to the even peaks (rarefaction phase\nof the fluid oscillation) in the CMB, and generate deeper oscillations in the LSS.\nIn particular, the relative magnitudes of the first and second acoustic peaks are\nsensitive to \u03c9b , as we see also in figure 15. These effects are completely due to O\nbaryons. In fact, even if not shown, we have verified that an increase of \u03c9b with a\nconstant \u03c9b\u2032 has exactly the same consequences for this value of x, while the effect\nof M baryons becomes relevant if we raise the temperature of the mirror sector.\n\u2022 Hubble constant (figs. 8 and 9): h varies from 0.50 to 0.90, but now we can leave\nconstant either \u03a9b = \u03a9\u2032b (fig. 8) or \u03c9b = \u03c9b\u2032 (fig. 9). In both cases a decrease\nin h corresponds to a delay in the epoch of matter-radiation equality and to a\ndifferent expansion rate. This boosts the CMB peaks and slightly changes their\nlocation toward higher l's (similar to the effect of an increase of \u03a9\u039b ), and induces a\ndecrease in the LSS spectrum. There are slight differences between the two situations\nof \u03a9 or \u03c9 constant, evident in particular on the first acoustic peak and on the\nmatter oscillations. If fact, when we consider \u03c9b, b\u2032 constant, the baryon densities\n\u03a9b, b\u2032 = \u03c9b, b\u2032 /h2 grow for decreasing h, then favouring the raise of the first peak in\nthe CMB and the onset of oscillations in the LSS.\n\u2022 Spectral index (fig. 10): n varies from 0.90 to 1.10. Increasing n will raise the power\nspectra at large l's with respect to the low l's and at large values of k with respect\nto low values. This is not evident in figure (except before the first acoustic peak),\nwhere the curves seem nearly parallel as if they were simply vertically shifted; this\nmeans a low sensitivity to the spectral index in this range, as also evident in figures\n14 and 15 for the CMB.\n\u2022 Extra-neutrino species (fig. 11): \u2206N\u03bd varies from 0.0 to 1.5. The effect of increasing\nthe number of massless neutrino species is a slow raise of the first acoustic peak and\na shift to higher l values for next peaks, together with a slight lowering of the matter\npower spectrum; all these changes are nearly proportional to \u2206N\u03bd , as shown also in\nfigures 14 and 15.\n\u2022 Ratio of temperatures (fig. 12): x varies from 0.2 to 0.7. Concerning the CMB,\nthe effect of raising x is qualitatively the same as an increase in \u2206N\u03bd , but more\npronounced (for these \"cosmologically compatible\" ranges) and with a non-linear\ndependence. In the LSS spectrum, instead, the situation is different from the case\nof extra-neutrino species, as now a growth of x induces the onset of the oscillatory\n14\n\n\ffeatures at lower values of k. These behaviours have been studied in more details in\n\u00a7 3 and \u00a7 4.\n\u2022 M baryon density (fig. 13): \u03c9b\u2032 varies from 0.01 (\u03c9b / 2) to 0.08 (4\u03c9b ). The value\nof x is now raised to 0.7, because for 0.2 there aren't differences between models\nwith different \u03c9b\u2032 values (we start observing small deviations only for the higher kvalues in the matter power spectrum). Also this behaviour has been studied in more\ndetails in \u00a7 3 and \u00a7 4; here we want to emphasize the low sensibility of the CMB on\n\u03c9b\u2032 (with a slightly stronger dependence starting from the third peak) and, on the\ncontrary, the high sensitivity of the LSS. For the first one, an increase in \u03c9b\u2032 causes a\nvery low increase of the height of the first peak and a progressive more pronounced\ndecrease for the next peaks, while for the second one there is a rapid deepening of\nthe oscillations, slightly changing their locations.\nIn figures 14 and 15 we focus our attention on the CMB first three peaks, choosing\nsome indicator which could quantify the sensitivity to the parameters previously discussed.\nIn figure 14 we analyze the locations of the peaks, plotting the differences of the locations\nbetween the various models and the reference one for the three peaks; in figure 15 we plot\nthe deviations of the differences between the heights of the peaks from the same quantities\nobtained for the reference model. In this way we obtain a clear picture of the trends of\nthese indicators varying the parameters. These plots provide a useful reference in order\nto evaluate the influence of each parameter on the CMB and LSS power spectra, and\nthey contain a number of informations; we can extract some of them particularly worth\nof noting.\nLooking at the locations, we see a great sensitivity on the matter density and the\nHubble constant, and a negligible one on the spectral index and the amount of mirror\nbaryons. Concerning the extra-neutrino species and the temperature of the sectors, the\nsensitivities are comparable, but the trends are different: they are respectively a constant\nslope for \u2206N\u03bd and an increasing one for x.\nAs regards the peak temperatures, the most sensitive parameter, besides \u03a9m and h,\nis \u03c9b ; the dependence on n and \u03c9b\u2032 is a bit greater than what it is for the locations, and\nthe differences between the trends with N\u03bd and x are slightly more evident, specially for\nvalues x > 0.6.\n\n15\n\n\f80\n\n\u03a9M\n\n[l(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0]1/2 (\u03bc\u039a)\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nl\n\nP(k)h3 (Mpc3)\n\n105\n\n104\n\n103\n\n102\n0.01\n\n0.10\nk/h (Mpc\u22121)\n\nFigure 6: Dependence of the shape of photon and matter power spectra on the matter density\n\u03a9m .

It is due to the slowness of our present version of the numerical code, but our game will be to choose some\nrepresentative model and compare it with observations.\nIn the last decade the anisotropies observed in the CMB temperature became the most\nimportant source of information on the cosmological parameters: a lot of experiments\n(ground-based, balloon and satellite) were dedicated to its measurement. At the same\ntime, many authors proved that its joint analysis with the fluctuations in the matter\ndistribution (they have both the same primordial origin) are a powerful instrument to\ndetermine the parameters of the Universe. As in \u00a7 3 and \u00a7 4, we analyze separately the\nvariation of x and \u03c9b\u2032 in the mirror models, using now both the CMB and LSS informations\nat the same time.\nIn order to compare our predictions with observations, we use data among the best\nones available at present: for the CMB the WMAP [26] and ACBAR [27] data, and for\nthe LSS the 2dF survey (in particular the binned power spectrum obtained by Tegmark\net al. [28]). In order to compare with the standard CDM results, we choose a reference\ncosmological model with scalar adiabatic perturbations and no massive neutrinos with the\nfollowing set of parameters [23]: \u03a9m = 0.25, \u03c9b = 0.023, \u03a9\u039b = 0.75, h = 0.73, n = 0.97.\nAs usually, we include in this model the mirror sector; for the sake of comparison, in all\ncalculations the total amount of matter \u03a9m = \u03a9CDM + \u03a9b + \u03a9\u2032b is maintained constant.\nMirror baryons contribution is thus always increased at the expenses of diminishing the\nCDM contribution.\nWe start from figure 16, where we assume that the dark matter is entirely due to mirror\nbaryons and we consider variations of the x parameter (as in the upper part of figures 1 and\n3). In top panel, we see that with the accuracy of the current anisotropy measurements\nthe CMB power spectra for mirror models are perfectly compatible with data, except for\nthe higher-x one. Indeed, the deviations from the standard model are weak for x <\n\u223c 0.5,\neven in a Universe full of mirror baryons (see \u00a7 3). In lower panel, instead, the situation\nis very different: oscillations due to mirror baryons are too deep to be in agreement with\ndata, and only models with low values of x (namely x <\n\u223c 0.3) are acceptable. Thus, we\nfind the first strong constraint on the mirror parameter space: models with high mirror\nsector temperatures and all the dark matter made of mirror baryons have to be excluded.\nIn figure 17 we compare with observations models with the same x, but different mirror\nbaryon contents (as in the bottom panels of figures 1 and 3). The above mentioned low\nsensitivity of the CMB power spectra on \u03c9b\u2032 doesn't give us indications for this parameter\n(even for high values of x), but the LSS power spectrum helps us again, confirming a\nsensitivity to the mirror parameters greater than the CMB one. This is another example of\nthe great advantage of a joint analysis of CMB and LSS power spectra, being the following\nconclusion impossible looking at the CMB only. This plot tells us that also high values of\nx can be compatible with observations if we decrease the amount of mirror baryons in the\nUniverse. It is a second useful indication: in case of high mirror sector temperatures we\nhave to change the mirror baryon density in order to reproduce the oscillations present in\nthe LSS data.\n26\n\n\fTherefore, after the comparison with experimental data, we are left with three possibilities for the Mirror Universe parameters:\n\u2032\n\u2022 high x <\n\u223c 0.5 and low \u03c9b (differences from the CDM in the CMB, and oscillations in\nthe LSS with a depth modulated by the baryon density);\n\u2032\n\u2022 low x <\n\u223c 0.3 and high \u03c9b (completely equivalent to the CDM for the CMB, and few\ndifferences for the LSS in the linear region);\n\n\u2022 low x and low \u03c9b\u2032 (completely equivalent to the CDM for the CMB, and nearly\nequivalent for the LSS in the linear region and beyond, according to the mirror\nbaryon density).\nThus, with the current experimental accuracy, we can exclude only models with high x and\nhigh \u03c9b\u2032 . Our next step will be to consider some interesting mirror models and compute\ntheir power spectra.\nIn figure 18 we plot models with equal amounts of ordinary and mirror baryons and\na large range of temperatures. This is an interesting situation, because the case \u03a9\u2032b = \u03a9b\ncould be favoured in some baryogenesis scenario with some mechanism that naturally lead\nto equal baryon number densities in both visible and hidden sectors [22]. These models are\neven more interesting when we consider both their CMB and LSS power spectra. In top\npanel of figure we see that the temperature anisotropy spectra are fully compatible with\nobservations until x \u2243 0.5, without large deviations from the standard case. In bottom\npanel, we have a similar situation for the matter power spectra, with some oscillations and\na slightly greater slope, that could be useful to better fit the oscillations present in the\ndata and to solve the discussed problem of the desired cutoff at low scales. Let us observe\nthat we are deliberately neglecting the biasing problem, given that an indication on its\nvalue can come only from a fit of the parameters; then, we have indeed a small freedom\nto vertically shift the curves in order to better fit the experimental data.\nModels of a Mirror Universe where the dark matter is composed in equal parts by CDM\nand mirror baryons are plotted in figure 19. Here we concentrate on x-values lower than\nthe previous figure, because the greater mirror baryonic density would generate too many\noscillations in the linear region of the matter power spectrum. In top panel we show that,\napart from little deviations for the model with higher x, all other models are practically\nthe same. In bottom panel, instead, deviations are big, and we can still use LSS as a test\nfor models. Indeed, models with x >\n\u223c 0.4 are probably to exclude, even taking into account\na possible bias. Models with lower x are all consistent with observations.\nObserving the figures, even if it is surely premature (given the lack of a detailed\nstatistical analysis of mirror models), we are tempted to guess that mirror baryons could\nhopefully better reproduce the oscillations present in the LSS power spectra. Thus, we\nare waiting for more accurate data (in particular for the large scale structure) in order to\nobtain indications for a standard or a Mirror Universe.\n\n27\n\n\f80\n\n\u03a9M=0.25, \u03c9b=0.023, h=0.73, n=0.97\nx=0.3, no CDM\n\n[l(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0]1/2 (\u03bc\u039a)\n\nx=0.5, no CDM\nx=0.7, no CDM\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n0\n\nWMAP\n\n200\n\nACBAR\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\nl\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n105\n\n2df bin.\n\nP(k)h3 (Mpc3)\n\n104\n\n103\n\n102\n\n101\n0.01\n\n0.10\nk/h (Mpc\u22121)\n\nFigure 16: CMB and LSS power spectra for various mirror models with different values of x,\ncompared with observations and with a standard reference model (solid line) of parameters \u03a90 = 1,\n\u03a9m = 0.25, \u03a9\u039b = 0.75, \u03c9b = \u03a9b h2 = 0.023, h = 0.73, n = 0.97.

This bound implies that the relativistic contribution to the\ncosmological energy density is dominated by the ordinary sector, while for the matter\ncomponent the complementary situation can occur and the dark matter of the Universe\ncan be made, in part or entirely, of mirror baryonic dark matter (MBDM).\nIn the first paper of this series [1] we showed that, since the existence of a mirror\nhidden sector changes the time of key epochs and the nature of dark matter, there are\nimportant consequences in the structure formation scenario for a Mirror Universe. We\nstudied the possible mirror scenarios in presence of adiabatic scalar density perturbations\nin the context of the Jeans gravitational instability theory, finding important differences\nfrom the cold dark matter model.\nHere, in order to evaluate the effects of a mirror sector on the CMB and LSS, we\nmodified a numerical code existing for the standard Universe in order to take into account\na hidden mirror sector; in this way we were able to predict the expected power spectra\nof cosmic microwave background and large scale structure for a flat Mirror Universe with\nadiabatic scalar density perturbations. In this MBDM scenario we studied the dependence\nof power spectra on mirror parameters x and \u03a9\u2032b , and also on other cosmological parameters, as \u03a9m , \u03a9b , h, n, N\u03bd . We enlarged our previous studies on this topic [11], considering\na much larger set of models. This allowed us to study in detail the sensitivity of mirror CMB and LSS spectra on the cosmological parameters and to show some interesting\nmirror model which could be a viable alternative to the standard ones.\nIn CMB spectra we found various differences from a so-called standard (CDM) reference model for x >\n\u223c 0.3 and a non-linear dependence on x, specially evident in the first\nand third peaks. The dependence on the mirror baryon density is instead very low. We\ncomputed also the power spectrum of mirror CMB photons, even if, unfortunately, by\ndefinition we can't reveal them and we cannot exchange the information with the mirror\nphysicists and combine our observations.\nTurning to the LSS power spectra, we showed an influence of the mirror sector bigger\nthan for the CMB, with a great dependence on both mirror temperature and baryonic\ndensity. Both of them control the oscillations generated in power spectrum, but the first\none influences the scale at which they start, while the second one their depth. In this case\nthe mirror sector effects are evident also for low x-values, if we don't take a too small\nvalue for \u03a9\u2032b . We extended the models also to smaller (non linear) scales, in order to show\nthe cutoff present in the mirror scenario, due to the existence of the dissipative mirror\nSilk scale. We demonstrated the existence of this cutoff, specially dependent on x-value,\nbut modulated also by \u03a9\u2032b . This is an important feature of the mirror structure formation\nscenario, because it could explain the observed small number of substructures which is a\nproblem for cold dark matter. Furthermore, we showed that for low x-values, x <\n\u223c 0.3,\nMBDM is equivalent to CDM for the CMB and LSS at linear scales. This is an interesting\nopportunity for mirror matter, since for low mirror temperatures we could obtain models\ncompletely equivalent to the CDM scenario at larger scales (when it works well), but with\nless power at smaller scales (when it has problems).\nIn addition, we have shown the dependence of the photon and matter power spectra on\nthe used cosmological parameters, in order to know the relative sensitivities. For the CMB\ncase, we used also some indicators, as the differences between the heights and positions of\nthe peaks compared with the same quantities computed for a reference model.\n32\n\n\fOur predictions have been compared with the observations (the WMAP [26] and\nACBAR [27] data for the CMB, and the 2dF binned data [28] for the LSS) in order\nto obtain bounds on the possible existence of the mirror sector. In this stage we jointly\nconsidered both CMB and LSS data, obtaining important limits on the mirror parameter\nspace. In fact, just from a visual inspection we easily found that mirror models with high x\nand high \u03a9\u2032b are excluded by LSS observations, because they generate too deep oscillations\nin power spectra.\nEven if a statistical analysis is necessary in order to extract detailed informations from\nthe experimental data, nevertheless we can reach some general conclusion in a rather\nstraightforward way:\n\u2022 The present LSS data are not compatible with a scenario where all the dark matter is\nmade of mirror baryons, unless we consider enough small values of x: x <\n\u223c 0.3 \u223c xeq .\n\u2022 High values of x, x > 0.5, can be excluded even for a relatively small amount of\nmirror baryons. In fact, we observe relevant effects on LSS and CMB power spectra\ndown to values of M baryon density of the order \u03a9\u2032b \u223c \u03a9b .\n\u2022 Intermediate values of x, 0.3 < x < 0.5, can be allowed if the MBDM is a subdominant component of dark matter, \u03a9\u2032b <\n\u223c \u03a9b <\n\u223c \u03a9CDM .\n\u2022 For small values of x, x < 0.3, the MBDM and the CDM scenarios are indistinguishable as concerns the CMB and the linear LSS power spectra. In this case, in\nfact, the mirror Jeans and Silk lengths, which mark region of the spectrum where\nthe effects of mirror baryons are visible, decrease to very low values, which undergo\nnon linear growth from relatively large redshift (for details see Paper 1 [1]).\nThus, with the current experimental accuracy, we can exclude only models with high\nx and high \u03a9\u2032b ; however, there can be many possibilities to disentangle the cosmological\nscenario of two parallel worlds with the future high precision data concerning the large\nscale structure, CMB anisotropy, structure of the galaxy halos, gravitational microlensing,\noscillation of observable particles into their mirror partners, etc.\nThe aim of these series of papers was contained in a question: \"is mirror matter still\na reliable dark matter candidate?\" Now, at the end of this second paper, we reached a\npartial answer: on the light of current observations of CMB and LSS at linear scales the\nmirror baryonic dark matter is fully in agreement with experimental data. In addition,\nwe obtained some useful constraints on the mirror parameter space, that can address our\nfuture efforts to understand other aspects of the Mirror Universe. Furthermore, so far\nthe mirror dark matter candidate still shows interesting potentialities to solve some open\nproblems of the \"standard\" cosmological scenario.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI am grateful to my invaluable collaborators Zurab Berezhiani, Denis Comelli and Francesco\nVillante.
