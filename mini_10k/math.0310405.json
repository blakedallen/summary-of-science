Introduction\n1.1. Let A \u2192 B be an abelian scheme. For a subvariety C of B, we shall denote by A(C)\nthe group of sections of the abelian scheme A \u00d7B C \u2192 C. We shall prove the following:\nTheorem 1.1. Let B be a smooth, irreducible, quasi-projective variety over the complex\nnumbers and assume that B has a projective compactification B\u0304 such that B\u0304 \u2212 B is of\ncodimension at least two in B\u0304. Then there exists a family of smooth ireducible curves {Cq }q\u2208Q\nin B parametrised by an irreducible variety Q such that if p : A \u2192 B is an abelian scheme\nand q \u2208 Q is a generic point, then the restriction map on sections A(B) \u2192 A(Cq ) is an\nisomorphism.\nThis answers, in a special case, a question of Graber, Harris, Mazur and Starr [5, Question\n4].\n1.2. Our method of proof is briefly as follows: we first prove the theorem for isotrivial\nabelian schemes and then reduce the general case to a cohomological statement using the\ncycle class map. The Lefschetz hyperplane section theorem allows us to further reduce to\nthe case that B is a surface. This is then handled by a monodromy argument involving the\ncohomology of Lefschetz pencils with coefficients in a local system.\nRemark 1.2. It seems possible that our method can be extended to any smooth, quasiprojective base B. However, the monodromy computations become much more difficult in\nthis generality.\n1.3. Conventions. All our varieties will be over the field of complex numbers C. By a\ngeneric point of such a variety we shall mean a closed point lying outside a countable union\nof proper closed subvarieties while by a general point we shall mean a closed point lying in\nsome Zariski open subset.\n2. Preliminary reductions\n2.1. In this section A \u2192 B, A\u2032 \u2192 B will always be abelian schemes with B a smooth,\nirreducible quasi-projective variety of dimension \u2265 1. Unless stated otherwise, C will be a\nsmooth, irreducible curve in B such that the map \u03c01 (C) \u2192 \u03c01 (B) is surjective.\nLemma 2.1. Suppose the map A(B) \u2297 Q \u2192 A(C) \u2297 Q is an isomorphism. Then the map\nA(B) \u2192 A(C) is also an isomorphism.\nProof. Since all elements of the kernel of the restriction map are torsion, the kernel must\nbe zero since a non-zero torsion point always specializes to a non-zero torsion point. For\nany \u03c3 \u2208 A(C) there exists \u03c4 \u2208 A(B) and n > 0 such that the restriction of n\u03c4 to C is\n\u03c3. Let Z(\u03c4, n) = [n]\u22121 (\u03c4 (B)), where [n] : A \u2192 A is the multiplication by n map. Z(\u03c4, n)\nis finite \u00e9tale over B, so the surjectivity assumption on fundamental groups implies that\n1\n\n\f2\n\nNAJMUDDIN FAKHRUDDIN\n\nthe restriction map induces a bijection from the set of components of Z(\u03c4, n) and those of\nZ(\u03c4, n) \u00d7B C. Since \u03c3 corresponds to a component of Z(\u03c4, n) \u00d7B C which is of degree 1 over\nC, it follows that it must be the restriction of an element of A(B).\n\u0003\nLemma 2.2. Suppose the map A(B) \u2192 A(C) is an isomorphism and let A \u2192 A\u2032 be an\nisogeny of abelian schemes over B. Then the map A\u2032 (B) \u2192 A\u2032 (C) is also an isomorphism.\nProof. This follows from Lemma 2.1 since A(B) \u2297 Q \u223c\n= A\u2032 (B) \u2297 Q.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.3. Suppose both the maps A(B) \u2192 A(C), and A\u2032 (B) \u2192 A\u2032 (C) are isomorphisms.\nThen the map A \u00d7B A\u2032 (B) \u2192 A \u00d7B A\u2032 (C) is also an isomorphism.\nProof. This is clear since A \u00d7B A\u2032 (B) = A(B) \u00d7 A\u2032 (B).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.4. Suppose A = A0 \u00d7B where A0 is an abelian variety i.e. A is a constant abelian\nscheme with fibre A0 . Let B\u0304 be a normal projective compactification of B and embed B\u0304 in\nPn for some n. Then for a generic complete intersection curve C in B of large degree, the\nmap A(B) \u2192 A(C) is an isomorphism.\nProof. Sections of a constant abelian scheme correspond to maps from the base to the fibre.\nFor a smooth, irreducible, quasi-projective variety X we denote by Alb(X) the Albanese\nvariety of any smooth projective compactification of X. This is universal for morphisms of\nX to abelian varieties and is determined by the mixed Hodge structure on H1 (X, Z) [3].\nSuppose dim(B) > 2. Then by the theorem of Goresky and MacPherson [4, p. 150], it\nfollows that if B \u2032 is a general hyperplane section of B then the map H1 (B \u2032 , Z) \u2192 H1 (B, Z)\nis an isomorphism. It follows that Alb(B \u2032 ) \u2192 Alb(B) is also an isomorphism hence\nA(B) = Mor(Alb(B), A0 ) \u2192 Mor(Alb(B \u2032 ), A0 ) = A(B)\nis an isomorphism.\nWe may thus assume that dim(B) = 2. Let C\u0304 be a general hypersurface section of B\u0304 and\ne Z) is a surjection,\nlet C = C\u0304 \u2229 B. It follows from loc. cit. that the map H1 (C\u0304, Z) \u2192 H1 (B,\ne is a resolution of singularities of B\u0304. Since Alb(C) = Alb(C\u0304) and Alb(B) = Alb(B),\ne\nwhere B\nwe get an exact sequence of abelian varieties\n0 \u2192 K \u2192 Alb(C) \u2192 Alb(B) \u2192 0 .\nIf B\u0304 is smooth, the usual theory of Lefschetz pencils [1, Expos\u00e9 XVIII] implies that if\nC is generic then K is a simple abelian variety which moreoever varies in moduli as C\nvaries, hence Hom(K, A0 ) = 0. If B is only normal, using Lemma 3.2 one sees that if\nthe degree of hypersurface is sufficiently large then the usual arguments show that K has\nno \"fixed part\" as C varies so we still have Hom(K, A0) = 0 for generic C. Therefore\nHom(Alb(B), A0 ) = Hom(Alb(C), A0 ), qnd so\nA(B) = Mor(Alb(B), A0 ) \u2192 Mor(Alb(C), A0 ) = A(C)\nis an isomorphism.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.5. Suppose A \u2192 B is isotrivial (i.e. there exists a finite \u00e9tale cover B \u2032 \u2192 B\nsuch that the abelian scheme A \u00d7B B \u2032 \u2192 B \u2032 is constant) and let C be a generic complete\nintersection curve of large degree. Then the map A(B) \u2192 A(C) is an isomorphism.\n\n\fRESTRICTION OF SECTIONS OF ABELIAN SCHEMES\n\n3\n\nProof. We first note that an isotrivial abelian scheme is determined by its monodromy representation \u03c01 (B) \u2192 Aut(A0 ), where A0 is the fibre over the basepoint.\nSuppose A(B) is non-torsion. Let A\u2032\u2032 be the connected component containing the zero\nsection of the Zariski closure of the union of the images of the elements of A(B). This is\na (non-trivial) abelian subscheme of A and is moreover constant since the monodromy acts\ntrivially on it. Then A is isogenous to A\u2032\u2032 \u00d7B (A/A\u2032\u2032 ), with A/A\u2032\u2032 also isotrivial. The lemma\nfollows in this case from Lemmas 2.4 and 2.3 along with induction on the relative dimension.\nIf A(B) is torsion, then A(C) must also be torsion. For otherwise A \u00d7B C would contain\na non-trivial constant abelian subscheme (by the argument above) which is not possible\nbecause of the surjectivity of \u03c01 (C) \u2192 \u03c01 (B). So the lemma follows from Lemma 2.1.\n\u0003\n2.2. Let p : A \u2192 B be an abelian scheme of relative dimension n and consider the local\nsystem V = R2n\u22121 p\u2217 Q on B. The monodromy representation corresponding to this local\nsystem is semisimple, so breaks up as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Let V =\nV1 \u2295 V2 , where V1 is the local system corresponding to the direct sum of all the irreducible\nsummands with finite image and V2 corresponds to the direct sum of those with infinite\nimage. Then there exist abelian schemes pi : Ai \u2192 B, i = 1, 2 such that A is isogenous\nto A1 \u00d7B A2 and R2n\u22121 pi \u2217 Q \u223c\n= Vi . A1 is isotrivial and A2 contains no isotrivial abelian\nsubschemes. By Lemmas 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5 the proof of Theorem 1.1 reduces to the case that\np : A \u2192 B is an abelian scheme which has no isotrivial abelian subschemes.\nNow suppose that p : A \u2192 B is as above with V1 = 0. Recall from [7] (or see [2]) that the\nvector space H 1 (B, V) carries a natural mixed Hodge structure of weights \u2265 2n.\nLemma 2.6. A(B) is a finitely generated abelian group and the cycle class map identifies1\nA(B) \u2297 Q (via the Leray spectral sequence) with the group of Hodge classes of type (n, n) of\nH 1 (B, V).\nProof. The finite generation follows from the theorem of Lang and N\u00e9ron [6].\nTo prove the injectivity of the map we may assume that B is a curve. The cycle class map\nreferred to above (after tensoring with Q) can be viewed as being induced by the boundary\nmap\n\u2202\nH 0 (B, A) = A(B)an \u2192 H 1 (B, VZ )\ncoming from the long exact cohomology sequence corresponding to the short exact sequence\nof sheaves on B in the analytic topology\n0 \u2192 VZ \u2192 Lie(A/B) \u2192 A \u2192 0 .\nHere A(B)an denotes the abelian group of complex analytic sections, VZ = R2n\u22121 p\u2217 Z and\nLie(A/B), the relative Lie algebra of A over B, is the locally free sheaf associated to the\ncomplex local system VZ \u2297 C.\nLet B\u0304 be the smooth compactification of B and let p\u0304 : \u0100 \u2192 B\u0304 be the N\u00e9ron model of A. If\n\u2202(\u03c3) = 0 for some 0 6= \u03c3 \u2208 A(B), then it lifts to a non-zero element \u03c3\ne of H 0 (B, Lie(B/A)).\nSince this is a complex vector space, the images of the elements te\n\u03c3 , t \u2208 C\u2217 give a 1-parameter\nfamily of elements of A(B)an . By the property of Neron models, \u03c3 extends to an element\n\u03c3\u0304 \u2208 \u0100(B\u0304), hence by continuity any element of A(B)an close to \u03c3 also extends to an element of\n\u0100(B\u0304)an = \u0100(B\u0304). This implies that A must contain a non-trivial constant abelian subscheme,\nwhich contradicts the hypotheses.\n1For\n\nthe proof of Theorem 1.1 the surjectivity of the map is not essential.\n\n\f4\n\nNAJMUDDIN FAKHRUDDIN\n\nThe surjectivity follows from Lefschetz's theorem on (1, 1) classes since cup product with\n\u03b8n\u22121 , where \u03b8 \u2208 H 0 (B, R2 p\u2217 Q) is the class of a polarisation, induces an isomorphism of\nmixed Hodge structures\nH 1 (B, R1 p\u2217 Q) \u2192 H 1 (B, R2n\u22121 p\u2217 Q) \u2297 Q(n \u2212 1) .\n\u0003\nRemark 2.7. If C is a generic complete intersection curve in B then the restriction map\nH 1 (B, V) \u2192 H 1 (C, V|C ) is always an injection; the difficulty lies in showing that all Hodge\nclasses of type (n, n) lie in the image.\n3. Lefschetz pencils with coefficients\n3.1. In this section we state mild generalisations of a couple of the results of the theory of\nLefschetz pencils.\nLemma 3.1. Let D be the open unit disc in C, X a connected, two dimensional, complex\nmanifold and \u03c0 : X \u2192 D a proper analytic map whose differential is non-zero except at a\nsingle point x0 \u2208 X above 0 \u2208 D where it has a non-degenerate critical point. Let V be a local\nsystem of Q-vector spaces on X. Then the monodromy of R1 \u03c0\u2217 V restricted to D \u2217 = D \u2212 {0}\nis unipotent.\nProof. This follows from the results in SGA7 II [1, Expos\u00e9s XIII & XIV]: we only indicate\nthe slight changes that need to be made. Let y \u2208 D \u2217 be a basepoint and \u03c3 : H 1 (Xy , V) \u2192\nH 1 (Xy , V) be the monodromy automorphism. Then \u03c3 \u2212 1 is the composite of the following\nsequence of maps\nj\u2217\n\nj0\u2217\n\nVar\n\nH 1 (Xy , V) \u2192 H 1 (V, V) \u2212\u2192 Hc1 (V 0 , V) \u2192 H 1 (Xy , V)\nwhere V is defined on [1, p. 136], j : V \u2192 Xy , j 0 : V 0 \u2192 Xy , are the inclusions and, following\n[1, p. 151], the map Var is as follows: since V is constant on V we may write V|V \u223c\n= \u2295ri=1 Q*vi ,\nwhere vi , i = 1, 2, . . . , r = rank(V), is a local basis of sections. This gives rise to elements\n\u03b4i \u2208 Hc1 (V 0 , V) which are well defined upto sign. The basis also gives an isomorphism V \u2192 V\u030c\nrestricted to V , where V\u030c is the dual local system of V, and hence induces an isomorphism\nHc1 (V 0 , V) \u223c\n= Hc1 (V 0 , V\u030c). We let \u03b4\u030ci \u2208 Hc1 (V 0 , V\u030c), = 1, 2, . . . , r be the elements corresponding\nto the \u03b4i 's under this isomorphism. Then for any x \u2208 H 1 (V, V)\nVar(x) = \u2212\n\nr\nX\n\n(x * \u03b4\u030ci ) \u03b4i ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the pairing (x * \u03b4\u030ci ) is the natural duality pairing.\nIt is clear that (j \u2217 (j\u22170 (\u03b4k )) * \u03b4\u030cl ) = 0 for all k, l = 1, 2, . . . , r, hence (\u03c3 \u2212 1)2 = 1. Thus \u03c3 is\nunipotent.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.2. Let X be a normal projective surface, S a finite subset of X including all its\nsingular points and Y = X \u2212 S. There exists a pencil of very ample curves on X, {Cp }p\u2208P1 ,\nwith the following properties:\n(1) A general element of the pencil is smooth and all Cp , p 6= \u221e are irreducible with at\nmost a single ordinary double point.\n(2) S \u2282 C\u221e\n\n\fRESTRICTION OF SECTIONS OF ABELIAN SCHEMES\n\n5\n\n(3) Cp and Cq for p 6= q meet transversally (at smooth points of X).\nProof. Let L be a very ample line bundle on X and choose a trivialisation of L restricted to\nS i.e. an isomorphism L|S \u223c\n= OS (which induces a similar isomorphism for all tensor powers\nof L). For n > 0, let Vn be the subspace of H 0 (X, L\u2297n ) consisting of all sections whose\nrestriction to S is a constant section. If n is sufficiently large, this linear system is base point\nfree and induces a morphism \u03c6n : X \u2192 P(Vn ) which is an embedding on X \u2212 S and maps S\nto a single point.\nFix n as above and let Xn = \u03c6n (X) \u2282 P(Vn ). Let X\u030cn \u2282 P\u030c(Vn ) be the dual variety of Xn . It\nconsists of two irreducible components, the general point of one corresponding to hyperplanes\nin P(Vn ) tangent to a smooth point of Xn and the points of the other corresponding to\nhyperplanes containing \u03c6n (S).\nThe proof of the existence of Lefschetz pencils in [1] Expos\u00e9 XVII goes through without\nany changes to show that a general pencil in P\u030c(Vn ) gives rise to a pencil of hyperplane\nsections of Xn , which when pulled back to X satisfies all the conditions of the lemma. \u0003\n4. Proof of the theorem\n4.1. Let p : A \u2192 B be an abelian scheme of relative dimension n with B a smooth connected\nsurface and let V = R2n\u22121 p\u2217 Q. Let Y = B and let X be a normal projective compactification\nof Y with S = X \u2212 Y a finite set. Assume that V does not contain any non-trivial sub-local\nsystems with finite monodromy.\nProposition 4.1. Let L be an ample line bundle on X. Then for n sufficiently large (depending only on X) and C a generic element of H 0 (X, L\u2297n ) , the retriction map A(B) \u2192 A(C)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. We have seen in Section 2.2 that it suffices to prove that the restriction map H 1 (Y, V) \u2192\nH 1 (C, V|C ) induces a surjection on Hodge classes of type (n, n).\ne \u2192 P1 be obtained by blowing up the basepoints of a pencil on X obtained\nLet f : X\ne be the pullback\ne and let V\nby applying Lemma 3.2. Let Ye be the inverse image of Y in X\nof V to Ye . Let U be the open subset of P1 over which f is smooth, let Y \u2032 = f \u22121 (U),\ne Y \u2032 and let W = R1 f \u2032 \u2217 V\u2032 . Our hypothesis on the monodromy\nf \u2032 = f |Y \u2032 : Y \u2032 \u2192 U, V\u2032 = V|\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof V implies that f \u2217 V = 0, hence from the Leray spectral sequence for f \u2032 it follows that\nH 0 (U, W) = H 1 (Y \u2032 , V\u2032 ).\nLet u be a generic element of U and let C = Cu = f \u22121 (u). Let \u03b1 be a Hodge class of type\n(n, n) in H 1 (C, V|C ). Since u is generic and \u03b1 is an algebraic class, it follows that there exist\nan \u00e9tale morphism g : T \u2192 U with T a smooth connected curve, t \u2208 T such that g(t) = u,\nand an element \u03b2 \u2208 H 0 (T, g \u2217 W) such that t\u2217 (\u03b2) = \u03b1. It follows from Lemma 3.1 that the\nlocal monodromies of W around all the points of P1 \u2212 (U \u222a {\u221e}) are unipotent. Since the\nimage of \u03c01 (T ) in \u03c01 (U) is of finite index and A1 = P1 \u2212 {\u221e} is simply connected, it follows\nthat H 0 (U, W) = H 0 (T, g \u2217 W). So \u03b2 is already defined over U, hence comes from an element\nof H 1 (Y \u2032 , V\u2032 ).\ne is an\nThe proof is completed by observing that the pullback map H 1 (Y, V) \u2192 H 1 (Ye , V)\n1 e e\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nisomorphism and that the restriction map H (Y , V) \u2192 H (Y , V ) induces a surjection (in\nfact an isomorphism) on Hodge classes of type (n, n)2.\n\u0003\n2This\n\nis elementary in our situation since we know that such classes are algebraic.\n\n\f6\n\nNAJMUDDIN FAKHRUDDIN\n\n4.2. We now complete the proof of the main result of the paper:\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Choose a normal, projective compactification B\u0304 of B with B\u0304 \u2212 B of\ncodimension at least two in B\u0304 and embed B\u0304 in Pn for some n. If B \u2032 is a general hypersurface\nsection of B a theorem of Goresky and MacPherson [4, p. 150] implies that if dim(B \u2032 ) > 1\nthen \u03c01 (B \u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (B) is an isomorphism, and so also the restriction map\nH 1 (B, R2n\u22121 p\u2217 Q) \u2192 H 1 (B \u2032 , R2n\u22121 p\u2217 Q) .\nSince a complete intersection curve in B \u2032 is also a complete intersection curve in B, it follows\nfrom the above and the reductions in Section 2, that it suffices to prove the theorem in the\ncase B is a surface. This follows from the reductions in Section 2 and Proposition 4.1. We\nsee that the family of curves {Cq }q\u2208Q can be chosen to be all smooth complete intersection\ncurves in B of a fixed large multidegree.\n\u0003\n4.3. Acknowledgements.
