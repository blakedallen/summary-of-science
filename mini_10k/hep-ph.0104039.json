We argue that their prompt fluxes are observable in\na kilometer-scale neutrino telescope, even though the calculations are subjected to large uncertainties, which we quantify. We raise the possibility that\na small component of prompt neutrinos may already be present in the observed samples of current experiments. We also discuss the interplay of the\npredicted fluxes with those produced by the flavor oscillation of conventional\natmospheric neutrinos, and by anticipated cosmic sources.\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fThe quest to search for sources of cosmic neutrinos beyond the sun, to search for the\nparticles that constitute the cold dark matter, and to exploit other science opportunities\nranging from astronomy to particle physics, led to the commissioning of large volume highenergy neutrino telescopes. While AMANDA and Baikal are taking data [1,2], similar and\nmuch larger instruments are contemplated [3\u20136]. These detectors collect the Cherenkov\nradiation emitted by charged secondaries (electrons, muons and taus) produced in neutrino\ncharged current interactions in the ice or water surrounding the optical sensors. In order to\nfilter the background of atmospheric muons created by cosmic-ray interactions, only upwardgoing neutrinos which traverse the Earth are monitored. The first mission of a new neutrino\ntelescope is to calibrate the detector on the known flux of atmospheric neutrinos [7]. Up to\nabout 10 TeV, the main source of atmospheric neutrinos is the decay of pions and kaons in\nthe atmosphere produced in the interactions of cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere; we\nwill refer to them as constituting the \"conventional\" atmospheric neutrino flux. At higher\nenergies, these mesons interact rather than decaying into a neutrino because of the increasing\nlifetime of the parent mesons. Therefore the semileptonic decay of very-short lived charmed\nparticles becomes the dominant atmospheric source, giving rise to the \"prompt\" neutrino\nflux. The energy dependence of prompt neutrinos follows the cosmic ray spectrum whereas\nthe spectrum of conventional neutrinos is steeper by one power in energy because of the\ncompetition of decay with interaction of the parent particles. The prompt neutrino flux is\nindependent of zenith angle whereas conventional neutrinos are preferentially produced in\nthe rarified atmosphere at large zenith.\nIn this letter we discuss the possible existence of an observational window for prompt\nneutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. We calculate neutrino induced muon and tau event\nrates, recognizing that the fluxes are subject to large uncertainties arising from the combination of extreme atmospheric cascade parameters with different charm production models.\nWe will argue that the prompt fluxes are observable in high-energy neutrino telescopes and\nanalyse the interplay of the predicted fluxes with those produced by the flavor oscillation of\nconventional atmospheric neutrinos, and by anticipated cosmic sources.\nPrompt neutrinos are produced by production and semileptonic decay of heavy quarks\nproduced in cascades initiated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. In order to appreciate\nthe main ingredients in calculating the production of prompt leptons in the atmosphere,\nwe write an approximate solution to the cascade equations [8], valid for energies below the\ncharm critical energy (\u2248 108 GeV):\n\u03a6l (E) = Zpi (E) Zil (E)\n\n\u039bp (E)\n\u03a6p (E, 0),\n\u03bbp (E)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6l (E) is the flux of secondary leptons (l = \u03bc, \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc ) from the decay of charmed\nhadrons (i = D, Ds or \u039bc ) produced by cosmic ray hadrons. The charm production\nspectrum-weighted moment Zpi (E) describes the inclusive charm production cross section;\nZil (E) is the charm decay spectrum-weighted moment which represents the semileptonic\nthree-body decay kinematics; \u039bp (E) and \u03bbp (E) are, respectively, the proton attenuation\nand interaction lengths in air [9]. The primary cosmic ray flux at the top of the atmosphere\n\u03a6p (E, 0) is assumed to be composed of protons although the validity of the superposition\napproximation guarantees that the calculation extends to heavier nuclei. Above the charm\ncritical energy (the energy where interaction and decay of the charm particle compete in\n2\n\n\fthe evolution of the cascade), the charm interaction length \u03bbi (E) must also be taken into\naccount and the complete solution has to be considered. What the prompt tau-neutrino\nflux (l = \u03bd\u03c4 ) is concerned, it suffices to calculate a generalized decay Z-moment Zil (E), in\nEq. (1) which accounts for the decay chain: Ds \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 followed by \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 X (where X is\neither a \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc pair or a meson) [10].\nDetailed investigation of the charm induced muon-neutrino flux [11] reveals the large\nuncertainties in the prompt component resulting from the imprecise knowledge of atmospheric particle showering parameters: primary cosmic ray spectrum \u03a6p , spectrum-weighted\nmoments Zi\u03bd , attenuation and interaction lengths, \u039bp , \u03bbp and \u03bbi . Further uncertainty is\nassociated with the extrapolation to high energy of a variety of models describing the accelerator data on charm production such as the Quark Gluon String Model (QGSM) [12],\nRecombination Quark Parton Model (RQPM) [13] and perturbative QCD (pQCD) [14]. In\nthe end, we conclude that the calculated fluxes, for both \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 , are subjected to uncertainties of up to one order of magnitude for a given charm model. When comparison is made\nof alternative charm production models, the spread reaches two orders of magnitude. We\nwill therefore define an allowed range between the maximum and minimum prompt neutrino\nfluxes.\nThere are two contrasting approaches in calculating charm production cross sections.\nThe first is to blindly apply perturbative QCD. This is a questionable procedure because,\nat the extreme energies considered here, large logarithms connected with the small ratio\n\u221a\nof the charm quark mass and the square root of the center of mass energy, x = mc / s,\nare likely to modify the calculation. For instance, this procedure, even though subject to\nlarge ambiguities, routinely underestimates the production of strange particles at accelerator\nenergies. It may therefore be more appropriate to calculate charm production in the context\nof QCD-inspired models that have been patterned to accommodate accelerator data on\nstrange particle production. QGSM and RQPM fall into this category and predict similar\nand larger extrapolations for the charm production cross section at higher energies.\nThe detection rates of upward-going prompt neutrinos, i.e. the rates of neutrino induced\nmuons and taus, per year per effective detection area (in 2\u03c0 sr), can be estimated from our\nflux calculations following the prescription of Gandhi et al. [15]. We first concentrate on the\noperating neutrino telescopes, BAIKAL NT-200 [2] and AMANDA-II [1], and subsequently\nconsider the proposed km3 experiment, ICECUBE [5]; see Table I. Calculations use the\nmaximum and minimum allowed prompt fluxes. We show for comparison the expected rates\nfor muon-neutrinos from conventional atmospheric decays. Absorption in the Earth of the\nhighest energy neutrinos is taken into account. From Table I we anticipate a situation\nwhere more then a thousand prompt muon-neutrinos above 1 TeV may be extracted from\nICECUBE data using their flat zenith angle distribution as a signature. Furthermore, we\npredict about 200 prompt tau-neutrino candidates which also produce characteristic showers\nin the detector [16]. Above 10 TeV, the 20 remaining tau-neutrinos will have no counterpart\nfrom the tau-neutrinos resulting from the oscillation of conventional atmospheric neutrinos,\na source of which we consider further on.\nOur calculations raise the possibility that prompt neutrinos may be observed by highenergy neutrino telescopes, especially because models extrapolating to the larger fluxes are,\nat least in our opinion, more robust. We next discuss the interplay of the predicted fluxes\nwith those produced by the flavor oscillation of conventional atmospheric neutrinos, and by\n3\n\n\fanticipated sources of cosmic neutrinos.\nIn Figure 1 we present prompt \u03bd\u03bc fluxes corresponding to the allowed range between\nmaximum and minimum predictions [11], along with the conventional atmospheric flux [14].\nAmong the potential candidates of other high-energy neutrino sources [17], we will concentrate on cosmic accelerators such as active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts which\nproduce the highest energy photons observed, and are theorized to produce the highest\nenergy cosmic rays. Their anticipated diffuse neutrino flux is bounded by experimental information on measured high-energy fluxes of cosmic rays, specifically neutrons, and gamma\nrays. The two upper curves in Figure 1 labeled MPR (solid and dotted lines), represent the\nallowed range of neutrino fluxes from sources that are optically thick or thin to the emission of neutrons [18], respectively. The two intermediate straight lines labeled WB (dashed\nand long\u2013dashed), represent bounds imposed on sources which produce the highest energy\ncosmic rays [19]. The higher flux allows for cosmological evolution of the sources.\nWe note that the energy where the prompt neutrino flux exceeds the conventional one\nis roughly 10 TeV. Separation of the two components can be made, taking advantage of the\nfact that the conventional atmospheric flux has a characteristic and calculable zenith angle\ndistribution, while the prompt component is isotropic.\nIf cosmic sources exist near the MPR bounds, the prompt muon-neutrino window is\ndefinitely closed. Neutrino telescopes will detect cosmic neutrinos at very high rates and the\nprompt component is a background to be dealt with. The AMANDA experiment is already\nexploring this range of fluxes [7]. Between 105 GeV and 106 GeV the MPR bound for thin\nsources has essentially the same slope as the prompt flux. Since the bound is an upper limit,\nit may happen that the cosmic sources actually produce as many detectable neutrinos as\natmospheric interactions do, and it will be difficult to disentangle both components. The\nsituation is quite different when considering the extragalactic flux subjected to the WBbounds. For evolving sources, there is room for an excess of prompt neutrinos in the range\n20-300 TeV. For non-evolving sources scenario, then the prompt window may be open up to\nabout 2 PeV.\nThe allowed band for atmospheric charm-induced tau-neutrinos is presented in Figure 2.\nIn the absence of neutrino flavor oscillations, atmospheric \u03bd\u03c4 's from charm are the only\nsource of tau-neutrinos and the prompt window is completely open. We remind the reader\nthat cosmic beam dumps produce negligible fluxes of tau-neutrinos. Recent measurements\nof the Super-Kamiokande experiment [20] do however favor non-vanishing neutrino masses\nand produce compelling evidence for \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 flavor transitions, with maximum mixing angle\n(sin2 2\u03b8 = 1) and a square mass difference of \u2206m2 = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 . We therefore consider a\nscenario where the conventional atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc flux in Figure 1 is modified by this oscillation\nmechanism. In the calculation we consider the range log10 (\u2206m2 /eV2 ) = 2.5 \u00b1 0.5. Similarly,\nthe bounds bracketing the extragalactic diffuse muon-neutrino flux can be translated into\nestimates of bounds on a cosmic tau-neutrino flux by adopting a typical value for the ratio\nof \u03bd\u03c4 to \u03bd\u03bc vacuum flavor conversion, over astronomical baselines, of F\u03bd\u03c4 /\u03bd\u03bc = 0.5 [21].\nThe resulting fluxes are also shown in Figure 2. The appearance of a tau-neutrino below\n1 TeV is a clear indication of atmospheric neutrino oscillations from a conventional \u03bd\u03bc\nflux. Above \u2248 2 TeV, we face again the interplay between extragalactic bounds and the\natmospheric prompt component. For MPR scenarios, the prompt window may be closed;\nfor WB-bounds the prompt tau-neutrino appearance may dominate extragalactic oscillation\n4\n\n\ffluxes up to 50 TeV (for evolving sources), or even 500 TeV (for non-evolving sources).\nIn conclusion, we observe that the calculations of prompt neutrino fluxes are subjected\nto large uncertainties, arising from possible extreme cascade parameters combined with\ndifferent charm production models. We identified the possibility that prompt fluxes are\nobservable in a kilometer-scale neutrino telescope, particularly in the region from 2 TeV\nto 2 PeV. At the upper range of the predictions, a small component of prompt neutrinos\nmay already be present in the observed sample of high-energy atmospheric neutrinos of the\nAMANDA experiment [7].\nDetection of the atmospheric prompt-\u03bd\u03bc will provide unique information on heavy quark\ninteractions at energies not accessible to particle accelerators. The better characterization\nof the charm induced neutrino component will increase the discrimination power of neutrino\ndetectors at higher energies. Knowledge of atmospheric charm production is essential in\nidentifying the origin of a detected \u03bd\u03c4 above a few TeV, whose appearance may also result\nfrom neutrino flavor oscillations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Jean-Marie Fr\u00e8re for valuable discussions and suggestions.
