In practice, however, limited\ncomputing resources make it currently impossible to calculate processes with dynamical\nquark masses as light as those in the real world. Thus one performs simulations with quark\nmasses that are as light as possible and then extrapolates the lattice calculations to the\nphysical values using expressions calculated in chiral perturbation theory (\u03c7PT). This, of\ncourse, relies on the assumption that the quark masses are light enough that one is in the\nchiral regime and can trust \u03c7PT to be a good effective theory of QCD [1, 2].\nLattice simulations with staggered fermions [3] can at present reach significantly lighter\nquark masses than other fermion discretizations and have proven extremely successful in\naccurately reproducing experimentally measurable quantities [4, 5]. Staggered fermions,\nhowever, have the disadvantage that each quark flavor comes in four tastes. Because these\nspecies are degenerate in the continuum, one can formally remove them by taking the fourth\nroot of the quark determinant. In practice, however, the fourth root must be taken before\nthe continuum limit; thus it is an open theoretical question whether or not this fourthrooted theory becomes QCD in the continuum limit.1 Even if one assumes the validity of\nthe fourth-root trick, which we do in the rest of this paper, staggered fermions have other\ndrawbacks. On the lattice, the four tastes of each quark flavor are no longer degenerate, and\nthis taste symmetry breaking is numerically significant in current simulations [5]. Thus one\nmust use staggered chiral perturbation theory (S\u03c7PT), which accounts for taste-breaking\ndiscretization effects, to extrapolate correctly staggered lattice calculations to the continuum\n[7, 8, 9, 10]. Fits of S\u03c7PT expressions for meson masses and decay constants have been\nremarkably successful. Nevertheless, the large number of operators in the next-to-leading\norder (NLO) staggered chiral Lagrangian [10] and the complicated form of the kaon Bparameter in S\u03c7PT [11] both show that S\u03c7PT expressions for many physical quantities will\ncontain a daunting number of undetermined fit parameters. Another practical hindrance to\nthe use of staggered fermions as valence quarks is the construction of lattice interpolating\nfields. Although the construction of a staggered interpolating field is straightforward for\n1\n\nSee Ref. [6] for a recent review of staggered fermions and the fourth-root trick.\n\n2\n\n\fmesons since they are spin 0 objects [12, 13], this is not in general the case for vector\nmesons, baryons or multi-hadron states since the lattice rotation operators mix the spin,\nangular momentum and taste of a given interpolating field [14, 15, 16].\nThe use of Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) fermions [17] evades both the practical and theoretical\nissues associated with staggered fermions. Because GW fermions are tasteless, one can\nsimply construct interpolating operators with the right quantum numbers for the desired\nmeson or baryon. Moreover, massless GW fermions possess an exact chiral symmetry on\nthe lattice [18] which protects expressions in \u03c7PT from becoming unwieldy.2 Unfortunately,\nsimulations with dynamical GW quarks are approximately 10 to 100 times slower than\nthose with staggered quarks [25] and thus are not presently practical for realizing light\nquark masses.\nA practical compromise is therefore the use of GW valence quarks and staggered sea\nquarks. This so-called \"mixed action\" theory is particularly appealing because the MILC improved staggered field configurations are publicly available. Thus one only needs to calculate\ncorrelation functions on top of these background configurations, making the numerical cost\ncomparable to that of quenched GW simulations. Several lattice calculations using domainwall or overlap valence quarks with the MILC configurations are underway [26, 27, 28],\nincluding a determination of the isospin 2 (I = 2) \u03c0\u03c0 scattering length [29]. Although this\nis not the first I = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering lattice simulation [30, 31, 32, 33, 34], it is the only one\nwith pions light enough to be in the chiral regime [1, 2]. Its precision is limited, however,\nwithout the appropriate mixed action \u03c7PT expression for use in continuum and chiral extrapolation of the lattice data. With this motivation we calculate the I = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering\nlength in chiral perturbation theory for a mixed action theory with GW valence quarks and\nstaggered sea quarks.\nMixed action chiral perturbation theory (MA\u03c7PT) was first introduced in Refs. [35,\n36, 37] and was extended to include GW valence quarks on staggered sea quarks for both\nmesons and baryons in Refs. [38] and [39], respectively. \u03c0\u03c0 scattering is well understood in\ncontinuum, infinite-volume \u03c7PT [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], and is the simplest two-hadron\nprocess that one can study numerically with LQCD. We extend the NLO \u03c7PT calculations of\n2\n\nIn practice, the degree of chiral symmetry is limited by how well the domain-wall fermion [19, 20, 21] is\nrealized or the overlap operator [22, 23, 24] is approximated.\n\n3\n\n\fRefs. [41, 42] to MA\u03c7PT. A mixed action simulation necessarily involves partially quenched\nQCD (PQQCD) [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52], in which the valence and sea quarks are treated\ndifferently. Consequently, we provide the PQ\u03c7PT \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitude by taking an\nappropriate limit of our MA\u03c7PT expressions. In all of our computations, we work in the\nisospin limit both in the sea and valence sectors.\nThis article is organized as follows. We first comment on the determination of infinite\nvolume scattering parameters from lattice simulations in Section II, focusing on the applicability of L\u00fcscher's method [53, 54] to mixed action lattice simulations. We then review mixed\naction LQCD and MA\u03c7PT in Section III. In Section IV we calculate the I = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering\namplitude in MA\u03c7PT, first by reviewing \u03c0\u03c0 scattering in continuum SU(2) \u03c7PT and then\nby extending to partially quenched mixed action theories with Nf = 2 and Nf = 2 + 1\nsea quarks. We discuss the role of the double poles in this process [55] and parameterize\nthe partial quenching effects in a particularly useful way for taking various interesting and\nimportant limits. Next, in section V, we present results for the pion scattering length in\nboth 2 and 2 + 1 flavor MA\u03c7PT. These expressions show that it is advantageous to fit to\npartially quenched lattice data using the lattice pion mass and pion decay constant measured on the lattice rather than the LO parameters in the chiral Lagrangian. We also give\nexpressions for the corresponding continuum PQ\u03c7PT scattering amplitudes, which do not\nalready appear in the literature. Finally, in Section VI we briefly discuss how to use our\nMA\u03c7PT formulae to determine the physical scattering length in QCD from mixed action\nlattice data and conclude.\n\nII.\n\nDETERMINATION OF SCATTERING PARAMETERS FROM MIXED AC-\n\nTION LATTICE SIMULATIONS\n\nLattice QCD calculations are performed in Euclidean spacetime, thereby precluding the\nextraction of S-matrix elements from infinite volume [56]. L\u00fcscher, however, developed a\nmethod to extract the scattering phase shifts of two particle scattering states in quantum field\ntheory by studying the volume dependence of two-point correlation functions in Euclidean\nspacetime [53, 54]. In particular, for two particles of equal mass m in an s-wave state with\nzero total 3-momentum in a finite volume, the difference between the energy of the two\n\n4\n\n\fparticles and twice their rest mass is related to the s-wave scattering length:3\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0010 a \u00112\n4\u03c0a0\n1\na0\n0\n\u2206E0 = \u2212\n+ c2\n+O\n.\n3 1 + c1\nL\nL\nmL\nL3\n\n(1)\n\nIn the above expression, a0 is the scattering length (not to be confused with the lattice\nspacing, a), L is the length of one side of the spatially symmetric lattice, and c1 and c2 are\nknown geometric coefficients.4 Thus, even though one cannot directly calculate scattering\namplitudes with lattice simulations, Eq. (1), which we will refer to as L\u00fcscher's formula,\nallows one to determine the infinite volume scattering length. One can then use the expression for the scattering length computed in infinite volume \u03c7PT to extrapolate the lattice\ndata to the physical quark masses.\nBecause L\u00fcscher's method requires the extraction of energy levels, it relies upon the existence of a Hamiltonian for the theory being studied. This has not been demonstrated (and\nis likely false) for partially quenched and mixed action QCD, both of which are nonunitary.\nNevertheless, one can calculate the ratio of the two-pion correlator to the square of the\nsingle-pion correlator in lattice simulations of these theories and extract the coefficient of\nthe term which is linear in time, which becomes the energy shift in the QCD (and continuum) limit. We claim that in certain scattering channels, despite the inherent sicknesses\nof partially quenched and mixed action QCD, this quantity is still related to the infinite\nvolume scattering length via Eq. (1), i.e. the volume dependence is identical to Eq. (1) up\nto exponentially suppressed corrections.5 This is what we mean by \"L\u00fcscher's method\" for\nnonunitary theories. We will expand upon this point in the following paragraphs.\nIt is well known that L\u00fcscher's formula does not hold for many scattering channels in\nquenched theories because unitarity-violating diagrams give rise to enhanced finite volume\neffects [59]. For certain scattering channels, however, quenched \u03c7PT calculations in finite\nvolume show that, at 1-loop order, the volume dependence is identical in form to L\u00fcscher's\nformula [59, 60, 61]. Chiral perturbation theory calculations additionally show that the\nsame sicknesses that generate enhanced finite volume effects in quenched QCD also do so in\npartially quenched and mixed action theories [35, 36, 38, 50, 51, 62, 63, 64]. It then follows\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nHere we use the \"particle physics\" definition of the scattering length which is opposite in sign to the\n\"nuclear physics\" definition.\nThis expression generalizes to scattering parameters of higher partial waves and non-stationary particles [53, 54, 57, 58].\nHere, and in the following discussion, we restrict ourselves to a perturbative analysis.\n\n5\n\n\fthat if a given scattering channel has the same volume dependence as Eq. (1) in quenched\nQCD, the corresponding partially quenched (and mixed action) two-particle process will also\nobey Eq. (1). Correspondingly, scattering channels which have enhanced volume dependence\nin quenched QCD also have enhanced volume dependence in partially quenched and mixed\naction theories. We now proceed to discuss in some detail why L\u00fcscher's formula does or\ndoes not hold for various 2\u21922 scattering channels.\nFinite volume effects in lattice simulations come from the ability of particles to propagate over long distances and feel the finite extent of the box through boundary conditions.\nGenerically, they are proportional either to inverse powers of L or to exp(-mL), but L\u00fcscher's\nformula neglects exponentially suppressed corrections. Calculations of scattering processes\nin effective field theories at finite volume show that the power-law corrections only arise from\ns-channel diagrams [59, 61, 63, 65, 66]. This is because all of the intermediate particles can\ngo on-shell simultaneously, and thus are most sensitive to boundary effects. Consequently,\nwhen there are no unitarity-violating effects in the s-channel diagrams for a particular scattering process, the volume dependence will be identical to Eq. (1), up to exponential corrections. Unitarity-violating hairpin propagators in s-channel diagrams, however, give rise to\nenhanced volume corrections because they contain double poles which are more sensitive to\nboundary effects [59].6 Thus all violations of L\u00fcscher's formula come from on-shell hairpins\nin the s-channel.\nLet us now consider I = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering in the mixed action theory. All intermediate\nstates must have isospin 2 and s \u2265 4m2 . If one cuts an arbitrary graph connecting the\nincoming and outgoing pions, there is only enough energy for two of the internal pions to\nbe on-shell, and, by conservation of isospin, they must be valence \u03c0 + 's.7 Thus no hairpin\ndiagrams ever go on-shell in the s-channel, and the structure of the integrals which contribute\nto the power-law volume dependence in the partially quenched and mixed action theories\n6\n\n7\n\nWe note that, while the enhanced volume corrections in quenched QCD invalidate the extraction of scattering parameters from certain scattering channels, e.g. I = 0 [59, 61], this is not the case in principle for\npartially quenched QCD, since QCD is a subset of the theory. Because the enhanced volume contributions must vanish in the QCD limit, they provide a \"handle\" on the enhanced volume terms. In practice,\nhowever, these enhanced volume terms may dominate the correlation function, making the extraction of\nthe desired (non-enhanced) volume dependence impractical.\nWe restrict the incoming pions to be below the inelastic threshold; this is necessary for the validity of\nL\u00fcscher's formula even in QCD.\n\n6\n\n\fis identical to that in continuum \u03c7PT. This insures that L\u00fcscher's formula is correctly\nreproduced to all orders in 1/L with the correct ratios between coefficients of the various\nterms. Moreover, this holds to all orders in \u03c7PT, PQ\u03c7PT, MA\u03c7PT, and even quenched\n\u03c7PT. The sicknesses of the partially quenched and mixed action theories only alter the\nexponential volume dependence of the I = 2 scattering amplitude.8 This is in contrast\nto the I = 0 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude, which suffers from enhanced volume corrections away from\nthe QCD limit. In general, the argument which protects L\u00fcscher's formula from enhanced\npower-like volume corrections holds for all \"maximally-stretched\" states at threshold in the\nmeson sector, i.e. those with the maximal values of all conserved quantum numbers; other\nexamples include K + K + and K + \u03c0 + scattering. We expect that a similar argument will hold\nfor certain scattering channels in the baryon sector.\nTherefore the s-wave I = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering length can be extracted from mixed action\nlattice simulations using L\u00fcscher's formula and then extrapolated to the physical quark\nmasses and to the continuum using the infinite volume MA\u03c7PT expression for the scattering\nlength.9\n\nIII.\n\nMIXED ACTION LAGRANGIAN AND PARTIAL QUENCHING\n\nMixed action theories use different discretization techniques in the valence and sea sectors\nand are therefore a natural extension of partially quenched theories. We consider a theory\nwith Nf staggered sea quarks and Nv valence quarks (with Nv corresponding ghost quarks)\nwhich satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson relation [17, 18]. In particular we are interested in theories\nwith two light dynamical quarks (Nf = 2) and with three dynamical quarks where the\ntwo light quarks are degenerate (commonly referred to as Nf = 2 + 1). To construct the\ncontinuum effective Lagrangian which includes lattice artifacts one follows the two step\nprocedure outlined in Ref. [68]. First one constructs the Symanzik continuum effective\nLagrangian at the quark level [69, 70] up to a given order in the lattice spacing, a:\nLSym = L + aL(5) + a2 L(6) + . . . ,\n8\n\n9\n\n(2)\n\nIn fact, hairpin propagators will give larger exponential dependence than standard propagators because\nthey are more chirally sensitive.\nFor a related discussion, see Ref. [67]\n\n7\n\n\fwhere L(4+n) contains higher dimensional operators of dimension 4 + n. Next one uses the\nmethod of spurion analysis to map the Symanzik action onto a chiral Lagrangian, in terms\nof pseudo-Goldstone mesons, which now incorporates the lattice spacing effects. This has\nbeen done in detail for a mixed GW-staggered theory in Ref. [38]; here we only describe the\nresults.\nThe leading quark level Lagrangian is given by\n4Nf +2Nv\n\nL=\n\nX\n\na,b=1\n\nQ\u0304a [iD\n/ \u2212 mQ ]ab Qb ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the quark fields are collected in the vectors\nQNf =2 = ( u, d , j1 , j2 , j3 , j4 , l1 , l2 , l3 , l4 , \u0169, d \u0303)T ,\n{z\n} |{z}\n|{z} |\nvalence\n\nsea\n\n(4)\n\nghost\n\nQNf =2+1 = (u, d, s, j1 , j2 , j3 , j4 , l1 , l2 , l3 , l4 , r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 , \u0169, d\u0303, s\u0303)T\n| {z } |\n{z\n} | {z }\nsea\n\nvalence\n\n(5)\n\nghost\n\nfor the two theories. There are 4 tastes for each flavor of sea quark, j, l, r.10 We work in the\nisospin limit in both the valence and sea sectors so the quark mass matrix in the 2+1 sea\nflavor theory is given by\nmQ = diag(mu , mu , ms , mj , mj , mj , mj , mj , mj , mj , mj , mr , mr , mr , mr , mu , mu , ms ).\n| {z } |\n{z\n} | {z }\nvalence\n\nsea\n\n(6)\n\nghost\n\nThe quark mass matrix in the two flavor theory is analogous but without strange valence,\nsea and ghost quark masses. The leading order mixed action Lagrangian, Eq. (3), has an\napproximate graded chiral symmetry, SU(4Nf + Nv |Nv )L \u2297 SU(4Nf + Nv |Nv )R , which is\n\nexact in the massless limit. 11 In analogy to QCD, we assume that the vacuum spontaneously\n\nbreaks this symmetry down to its vector subgroup, SU(4Nf +Nv |Nv )V , giving rise to (4Nf +\n\n2Nv )2 \u2212 1 pseudo-Goldstone mesons. These mesons are contained in the field\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2020\nM \u03c7\n2i\u03a6\n\uf8f8.\n\u03a3 = exp\n, \u03a6=\uf8ed\nf\n\u03c7 M\u0303\n10\n\n11\n\n(7)\n\nNote that we use different labels for the valence and sea quarks than Ref. [38]. Instead we use the \"nuclear\nphysics\" labeling convention, which is consistent with Ref. [39].\nThis is a \"fake\" symmetry of PQQCD. However, it gives the correct Ward identities and thus can be used\nto understand the symmetries and symmetry breaking of PQQCD [51].\n\n8\n\n\fThe matrices M and M\u0303 contain bosonic mesons while \u03c7 and \u03c7\u2020 contain fermionic mesons.\nSpecifically,\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b7\n\uf8ec u\n\uf8ec \u2212\n\uf8ec\u03c0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ec .\nM =\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\u03c6ju\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03c6lu\n\uf8ed .\n..\n\uf8eb\n\u03c6\n\uf8ec \u0169u\n\uf8ec\n\u03c7 = \uf8ec\u03c6du\n \u0303\n\uf8ed\n..\n.\n\n\u03c0\n\n+\n\n. . . \u03c6uj \u03c6ul . . .\n\n\u03b7d . . .\n.. . .\n.\n.\n..\n\u03c6jd .\n.\n\u03c6ld ..\n.. ..\n. .\n\u03c6\u0169d . . .\n\u03c6dd\n \u0303 ...\n..\n..\n.\n.\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u03c6dj \u03c6dl . . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n. . . . . . . . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7\n\u03b7j \u03c6jl . . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u03c6lj \u03b7l . . .\uf8f7\n..\n.. . . \uf8f8\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8f6\n\u03c6\u0169j \u03c6\u0169l . . .\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u03c6dj\n \u0303 \u03c6dl\n \u0303 . . .\uf8f7 .\n\uf8f8\n..\n.. . .\n.\n.\n.\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03b7\u0303 \u03c0\u0303 . . .\n\uf8ec u\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nM\u0303 = \uf8ec\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 \u03b7\u0303d . . .\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.. .. . .\n.\n. .\n+\n\n(8)\n\nIn Eq. (8) we only explicitly show the mesons needed in the two flavor theory. The ellipses\nindicate mesons containing strange quarks in the 2+1 theory. The upper Nv \u00d7 Nv block\nof M contains the usual mesons composed of a valence quark and anti-quark. The fields\ncomposed of one valence quark and one sea anti-quark, such as \u03c6uj , are 1 \u00d7 4 matrices of\nfields where we have suppressed the taste index on the sea quarks. Likewise, the sea-sea\nmesons such as \u03c6jl are 4 \u00d7 4 matrix-fields. Under chiral transformations, \u03a3 transforms as\n\u03a3 \u2212\u2192 L \u03a3 R\u2020\n\n,\n\nL, R \u2208 SU(4Nf + Nv |Nv )L,R .\n\n(9)\n\nIn order to construct the chiral Lagrangian it is useful to first define a power-counting\nscheme. Continuum \u03c7PT is an expansion in powers of the pseudo-Goldstone meson momentum and mass squared [41, 42]:\n\u03b52 \u223c p2\u03c0 /\u039b2\u03c7 \u223c m2\u03c0 /\u039b2\u03c7 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere m2\u03c0 \u221d mQ and \u039b\u03c7 is the cutoff of \u03c7PT. In a mixed theory (or any theory which\nincorporates lattice spacing artifacts) one must also include the lattice spacing in the power\ncounting. Both the chiral symmetry of the Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks and the remnant\nU(1)A symmetry of the staggered sea quarks forbid operators of dimension five; therefore\nthe leading lattice spacing correction for this mixed action theory arises at O(a2 ). Moreover,\n\ncurrent staggered lattice simulations indicate that taste-breaking effects (which are of O(a2 ))\n9\n\n\fare numerically of the same size as the lightest staggered meson mass [5]. We therefore adopt\nthe following power-counting scheme:\n\u03b52 \u223c p2\u03c0 /\u039b2\u03c7 \u223c mQ /\u039bQCD \u223c a2 \u039b2QCD .\n\n(11)\n\nThe leading order (LO), O(\u03b52 ), Lagrangian is then given in Minkowski space by [38]\nL=\n\n\u0011\n\u0001 f 2B \u0010\nf2\nstr \u2202\u03bc \u03a3 \u2202 \u03bc \u03a3\u2020 +\nstr \u03a3m\u2020Q + mQ \u03a3\u2020 \u2212 a2 (US + US\u2032 + UV ) ,\n8\n4\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we use the normalization f \u223c 132 MeV and have already integrated out the taste\n\nsinglet \u03a60 field, which is proportional to str(\u03a6) [51]. US and US\u2032 are the well-known taste\nbreaking potential arising from the staggered sea quarks [7, 8]. The staggered potential\nonly enters into our calculation through an additive shift to the sea-sea meson masses; we\ntherefore do not write out its explicit form. The enhanced chiral properties of the mixed\naction theory are illustrated by the fact that only one new potential term arises at this order:\n\nwhere\n\n\u0001\nUV = \u2212CMix str \u03c43 \u03a3\u03c43 \u03a3\u2020 ,\n\n(13)\n\n\u03c43 = PS \u2212 PV = diag(\u2212IV , It \u2297 IS , \u2212IV ).\n\n(14)\n\nThe projectors, PS and PV , project onto the sea and valence-ghost sectors of the theory, IV\nand IS are the valence and sea flavor identities, and It is the taste identity matrix. From\nthis Lagrangian, one can compute the LO masses of the various pseudo-Goldstone mesons\nin Eq. (8). For mesons composed of only valence (ghost) quarks of flavors a and b,\nm2ab = B(ma + mb ).\n\n(15)\n\nThis is identical to the continuum LO meson mass because the chiral properties of GinspargWilson quarks protect mesons composed of only valence (ghost) quarks from receiving mass\ncorrections proportional to the lattice spacing. However, mesons composed of only sea\nquarks of flavors s1 and s2 and taste t, or mixed mesons with one valence (v) and one sea\n(s) quark both receive lattice spacing mass shifts. Their LO masses are given by\nm\u03032s1 s2 ,t = B(ms1 + ms2 ) + a2 \u2206(\u03bet ),\n\n(16)\n\nm\u03032vs = B(mv + ms ) + a2 \u2206Mix .\n\n(17)\n\n10\n\n\fFrom now on we use tildes to indicate masses that include lattice spacing shifts. The\nonly sea-sea mesons that enter \u03c0\u03c0 scattering to the order at which we are working are\nthe taste-singlet mesons (this is because the valence-valence pions that are being scattered\nare tasteless), which are the heaviest; we therefore drop the taste label, t. The splittings\nbetween meson masses of different tastes have been determined numerically on the MILC\nconfigurations [5], so \u2206(\u03beI ) should be considered an input rather than a fit parameter. The\nmixed mesons all receive the same a2 shift given by\n16CMix\n,\nf2\n\n\u2206Mix =\n\n(18)\n\nwhich has yet to be determined numerically.\nAfter integrating out the \u03a60 field, the two point correlation functions for the flavor-neutral\nstates deviate from the simple single pole form. The momentum space propagator between\ntwo flavor neutral states is found to be at leading order [51]\nQNf 2\n2\ni\ni\u01eba \u03b4ab\n2\nk=1 (p \u2212 m\u0303k + i\u01eb)\n\u2212\nG\u03b7a \u03b7b (p ) = 2\n, (19)\nQ\np \u2212 m2\u03b7a + i\u01eb Nf (p2 \u2212 m2\u03b7 + i\u01eb)(p2 \u2212 m2\u03b7 + i\u01eb) N\u2032f \u22121 (p2 \u2212 m\u03032 \u2032 + i\u01eb)\nk =1\nk\na\nb\n\nwhere\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 +1 for a = valence or sea quarks\n\u01eba =\n\uf8f3 \u22121 for a = ghost quarks .\n\n(20)\n\nIn Eq.

We begin, however, by reviewing the pion scattering amplitude in continuum\nSU(2) chiral perturbation theory. We next calculate the scattering amplitude in Nf = 2\nPQ\u03c7PT and MA\u03c7PT, and finally in Nf = 2 + 1 PQ\u03c7PT and MA\u03c7PT. When renormalizing divergent 1-loop integrals, we use dimensional regularization and a modified minimal\nsubtraction scheme where we consistently subtract all terms proportional to [41]:\n2\n\u2212 \u03b3E + log 4\u03c0 + 1,\n4\u2212d\nwhere d is the number of space-time dimensions.

We do not, however, include it here because we do not envision either\nusing the known values of the Gasser-Leutwyler parameters in the the fit of the scattering\nlength or using the fit to determine them. The simple expression (28) has already been used\nin extrapolation of lattice data from mixed action simulations [29], but it neglects lattice\nspacing effects from the staggered sea quarks which are known from other simulations to be\nof the same order as the leading order terms in the chiral expansion of some observables [5].\nWe therefore proceed to calculate the scattering amplitude in a partially quenched, mixed\naction theory relevant to simulations.\n\nB.\n\nMixed GW-Staggered Theory with two Sea Quarks\n\nThe scattering amplitude in the partially quenched theory differs from the unquenched\ntheory in three important respects. First, more mesons propagate in the loop diagrams.\nSecond, some of the mesons have more complicated propagators due to hairpin diagrams at\n13\n\n\f\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0+\n\nFIG. 2: Example quark flow for a one-loop t-channel graph. This diagram illustrates the presence\nof meson loops composed of purely valence-valence mesons which are not canceled by valence-ghost\nloops. Different colors (shades of grey) represent different quark flavors.\n\nthe quark level [51, 55]. Third, there are additional terms in the NLO Lagrangian which\narise from partial quenching [52], and lattice spacing effects [10, 38].\nAt the level of quark flow, there are diagrams such as Figure 2, which route the valence\nquarks through the diagram in a way which has no ghostly counterpart. Consequently,\nthe ghosts do not exactly cancel the valence quarks in loops. Of course, this is simply a\nreflection of the fact that the initial and final states - valence pions - are themselves\nnot symmetric under the interchange of ghost and valence quarks, and therefore the graded\nsymmetry between the valence and ghost pions has already been violated. This is well known\nin quenched and partially quenched heavy baryon \u03c7PT [71, 72, 73]. This fact also partly\nexplains the success of quenched \u03c0\u03c0 scattering in the I = 2 channel [30, 31]; quenching does\nnot eliminate all loop graphs like it does in many other processes, and in particular, the\ns-channel diagram is not modified by (partial) quenching effects. As a consequence, it is\nnecessary to compute all the graphs contributing to this process in order to determine the\nscattering amplitude.\nQuark level disconnected (hairpin) diagrams lead to higher order poles in the propagator\nof any particle which has the quantum numbers of the vacuum [51, 55]. In the isospin limit of\nthe Nf = 2 partially quenched theory, conservation of isospin prevents the \u03c0 0 from suffering\nany hairpin effects. Hence only the \u03b7\u0304 acquires a disconnected propagator. Moreover, in the\nm0 \u2192 \u221e limit, the \u03b7\u0304 propagator (given for a general PQ theory in Eq. (23)) is given by the\n\n14\n\n\fp3\n\np1\n\np3\n\np1\n\np4\n\np2\n\np4\n\np2\n\nFIG. 3: Example hairpin diagrams contributing to pion scattering.

Notice that when \u2206\nwhat we expect since, in the SU(2) theory, the only neutral propagating state is the \u03c0 0 .\n\nThe propagator in Eq. (29) can appear in loops, thereby producing new diagrams such as\nthose in Fig. 3.13 After adding all such hairpin diagrams, one finds that the contribution of\nthe \u03b7\u0304 to the amplitude is\n\n14\n\niA\u03b7\u0304 =\n\n \u03034\n4i \u2206\nPQ\n.\n(4\u03c0f\u03c0 )2 6f\u03c02\n\n(31)\n\nIn addition to 1-loop contributions, the NLO scattering amplitude receives tree-level\nanalytic contributions from operators of O(\u01eb4 ) in the chiral Lagrangian. At this order, the\nmixed action Lagrangian contains the same O(p4 ), O(p2 mq ), and O(m2q ) operators as in\n\n13\n\n14\n\nWe note that there are also similar contributions to the four particle vertex with a loop and to the mass\ncorrection. We do not show them, however, because they cancel against one another in the amplitude\nexpressed in lattice-physical parameters, which we will show in the following pages.\nWe note that this contribution does not vanish in the limit that m2\u03c0 \u2192 0 with m\u03032jj 6= 0. Similar effects\nhave been observed in quenched computations of pion scattering amplitudes [59, 60]. This non-vanishing\ncontribution is the I = 2 remnant of the divergences that are known to occur in the I = 0 amplitude at\nthreshold. These divergences give rise to enhanced volume corrections to the I = 0 amplitude with respect\nto the one-loop I = 2 amplitude and prevent the use of L\u00fcscher's formula. Moreover, it is known [48, 50]\nthat PQ\u03c7PT is singular in the limit mu \u2192 0 with nonzero sea quark masses, so the behavior of the\namplitude in this limit is meaningless.\n\n15\n\n\fthe continuum partially quenched chiral Lagrangian, plus additional O(a4 ), O(a2 mq ), and\n\nO(a2 p2 ) operators arising from discretization effects. We can now enumerate the generic\nforms of analytic contributions from these NLO operators. Because of the chiral symmetry\n\nof the GW valence sector, all tree-level contributions to the scattering length must vanish in\nthe limit of vanishing valence quark mass.15 Thus there are only three possible forms, each\nof which must be multiplied by an undetermined coefficient: m4uu , m2uu m2jj , and m2uu a2 . It\nmay, at first, seem surprising that operators of O(a2 mq ), which come from taste-symmetry\nbreaking and contain projectors onto the sea sector, can contribute at tree-level to a purely\nvalence quantity. Nevertheless, this turns out to be the case. These O(a2 mq ) mixed action\noperators can be determined by first starting with the NLO staggered chiral Lagrangian [10],\nand then inserting a sea projector, PS , next to every taste matrix. One example of such an\n\u0011\ni\nh \u0010\n\u0001\n\u2020\n\u2020\noperator is str \u03a3mQ str PS \u03be5 \u03a3\u03be5 \u03a3 + p.c. , where, \u03be5 is the \u03b35 matrix acting in taste-\n\nspace and p.c. indicates parity-conjugate. This double-trace operator will contribute to the\nlattice pion mass, decay constant, and 4-point function at tree-level because one can place\nall of the valence pions inside the first supertrace, and the second supertrace containing the\nprojector PS will just reduce to the identity.\nPutting everything together, the total mixed action scattering amplitude to NLO is\n(\n\"\n#\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u0012 2 \u0013\nm\u0303ju\nm\u03032ju\n4im2uu\nm2uu\nmuu\n\u2032\niAp~i =0 = \u2212 2\n1+\n4 ln\n+ 4 2 ln\n\u2212 1 + l\u03c0\u03c0\n(\u03bc)\n2\n2\n2\nf\n(4\u03c0f )\n\u03bc\nmuu\n\u03bc\n)\n\"\n\u0015#\n2\n \u03034\n \u0303 2 \u0014 \u0012 m2 \u0013\n \u03032\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\u2206\na\nm2uu\nPQ\nPQ\nPQ \u2032\nuu\n+ 2 ln\n+1\n+\nlP Q (\u03bc) +\nla\u2032 2 (\u03bc) .

In\nto re-express the analytic contribution proportional to the sea quark mass as m2 \u2206\nuu\n\nPQ\n\nEq. (32) we have multiplied every contribution from diagrams which contain a sea quark\nloop by 1/4, thus making our expression applicable to lattice simulations in which the fourth\nroot of the staggered sea quark determinant is taken.\nIt is useful, however, to re-express the scattering amplitude in terms of the quantities\n15\n\nAs we discussed in the previous footnote, this condition need not hold for loop contributions to the\nscattering amplitude.\n\n16\n\n\fthat one measures in a lattice simulation: m\u03c0 and f\u03c0 . Throughout this paper, we will\nrefer to these renormalized measured quantities as the lattice-physical pion mass and decay\nconstant.16 Because we are working consistently to second order in chiral perturbation\ntheory, we can equate the lattice-physical pion mass to the 1-loop chiral perturbation theory\nexpression for the pion mass, and likewise for the lattice-physical decay constant. Thus, in\nterms of lattice-physical parameters, the mixed action I = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitude is\n(\n)\n\u0014\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0015\n2\n2\n2\n \u03034\n\u2206\n4im\nm\nm\nm\nPQ\nA\u03c7P T\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\niApM\n= \u2212 2\u03c0 1 +\n,\n(33)\n3 ln\n\u2212 1 + l\u03c0\u03c0 (\u03bc) \u2212\n~i =0\nf\u03c0\n(4\u03c0f\u03c0 )2\n\u03bc2\n(4\u03c0f\u03c0 )2 6 m4\u03c0\nwhere the first few terms are identical in form to the full QCD amplitude, Eq. (28). This\nexpression for the scattering amplitude is vastly simpler than the one in terms of the bare\nparameters. First, the hairpin contributions from all diagrams except those in Fig. 3 have\nexactly cancelled, removing the enhanced chiral logs and leaving the last term in Eq. (33) as\nthe only explicit modification arising from the partial quenching and discretization effects.\nSecond, all contributions from mixed valence-sea mesons in loops have cancelled, thereby\nremoving the new mixed action parameter, CMix, completely.17 Third, all tree-level contributions proportional to the sea quark mass have also cancelled from this expression. And\nfinally, most striking is the fact that an explicit computation of the O(a2 mq ) contributions\nto the amplitude arising from the NLO mixed action Lagrangian show that these effects\nexactly cancel when the amplitude is expressed in lattice-physical parameters. This result\nwill be discussed in detail in Ref. [74]. Thus to reiterate, the only partial quenching and lattice spacing dependence in the amplitude comes from the hairpin diagrams of Fig. 3, which\n \u0303 4 = (m2 + a2 \u2206(\u03beI ) \u2212 m2 )2 , where m2 + a2 \u2206(\u03be1 )\nproduce contributions proportional to \u2206\nPQ\n\njj\n\n\u03c0\n\njj\n\nis the mass-squared of the taste-singlet sea-sea meson. Moreover, we presume that anyone\nperforming a mixed action lattice simulation will separately measure the taste-singlet seasea meson mass and use it as an input to fits of other quantities such as the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering\nlength. Thus we do not consider it to be an undetermined parameter.\n16\n\n17\n\nNotice that once the lattice spacing a has been determined, the lattice-physical pion mass can be unambiguously determined by measuring the exponential decay of a pion-pion correlator. We assume that the\nlattice spacing a has been determined, for example, by studying the heavy quark potential or quarkonium\nspectrum.\nAnother consequence of the exact cancelation of the loops with mixed valence-sea quarks is that one does\nnot have to implement the \"fourth-root trick\" through this order.\n\n17\n\n\fIt is now clear that one should fit \u03c0\u03c0 scattering lattice data in terms of the latticephysical pion mass and decay constant rather than in terms of the LO pion mass and LO\ndecay constant. By doing this, one eliminates three undetermined fit parameters: CMix, lP\u2032 Q ,\nand la\u2032 2 , as well as the enhanced chiral logs.\n\nC.\n\nMixed GW-Staggered Theory with 2 + 1 Sea Quarks\n\nThe 2 + 1 flavor theory has three additional quarks \u2013 the strange valence and ghost\nand strange sea quarks \u2013 which can lead to new contributions to the scattering amplitude.\nBecause we only consider the scattering of valence pions, however, strange valence quarks\ncannot appear in this process. Thus all new contributions to the scattering amplitude\nnecessarily come only from the sea strange quark, r. Because the r quark is heavier than\nthe other sea quarks there is SU(3) symmetry breaking in the sea. This symmetry breaking\nonly affects the pion scattering amplitude, expressed in lattice-physical quantities, through\nthe graphs with internal \u03b7\u0304 propagators because the masses of the mixed valence-sea mesons\ncancel in the final amplitude as they did in the earlier two flavor case. In addition, the\nonly signature of partial quenching in the amplitude comes from these same diagrams. It is\ntherefore worthwhile to investigate the physics of the neutral meson propagators further.\nThere are more hairpin graphs in the 2 + 1 flavor theory since the \u03b7s may propagate as\nwell as the \u03b7u and the \u03b7d . Because these mesons mix with one another, the flavor basis is\nnot the most convenient basis for the computation. Rather, a useful basis of states is \u03c0 0 ,\n\u221a\n\u03b7\u0304 = (\u03b7u + \u03b7d )/ 2 and \u03b7s . Since we work in the isospin limit, the \u03c0 0 cannot mix with \u03b7\u0304 or \u03b7s ;\nin addition, there is no vertex between the \u03b7s and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at this order, so we never encounter\na propagating \u03b7s . Thus all the PQ effects are absorbed into the \u03b7\u0304 propagator, which is given\nby\nG\u03b7\u0304 (p2 ) =\n\n2i (p2 \u2212 m\u03032jj )(p2 \u2212 m\u03032rr )\ni\n\u2212\n.\np2 \u2212 m2\u03c0\n3 (p2 \u2212 m2\u03c0 )2 (p2 \u2212 m\u03032\u03b7 )\n\n(34)\n\nIn SU(3) chiral perturbation theory, the neutral mesons are the \u03c0 0 and the \u03b78 . Therefore,\nin the PQ theory, we know that there will be a contribution from the \u03b7\u0304 graphs that does not\nresult from partial quenching or SU(3) symmetry breaking. Therefore the extra PQ graphs\n \u0303 P Q \u2192 0 limit, in contrast to the\narising from the internal \u03b7\u0304 fields must not vanish in the \u2206\ntwo flavor case of Eq.

For momenta that are small compared\n\nto m\u0303\u03b7 , the second term of this equation goes to zero in the large mr limit, and the 2 + 1\nflavor propagator reduces to the 2 flavor propagator, Eq.

Therefore, when\n\nthe strange sea quark mass is very large, i.e. m\u03032\u03b7 /m2\u03c0 \u226b 1, the 2 + 1 flavor amplitude reduces\nto the 2 flavor amplitude, Eq. (33), with the exception of terms that can be absorbed into\nthe analytic terms. The low energy constants have a scale dependence which exactly cancels\nthe scale dependence in the logarithms. The coefficient  \u0304l\u03c0\u03c0 is the same linear combination\nof Gasser-Leutwyler coefficients that appear in the SU(3) scattering amplitude expressed in\nterms of the physical pion mass and decay constant [43, 46].\nBecause the functions Fi depend logarithmically on x, the 2+1 flavor scattering amplitude\nfeatures enhanced chiral logarithms [48] that are absent from the 2 flavor amplitude. This is\na useful observation, as we will now explain. Because there is a strange quark in nature and\nits mass is less than the QCD scale, \u039bQCD , lattice simulations must use 2 + 1 quark flavors.\nIt is often practical to fix the strange quark mass at a constant value near its physical value\nin these simulations. This circumstance is helpful because, just as SU(2) chiral perturbation\ntheory is useful to describe nature at scales smaller than the strange quark mass, the 2 flavor\namplitude given in Eq. (33) can be used to extrapolate 2 + 1 flavor lattice data at energy\nscales smaller than the strange sea quark mass used in the simulation (provided, of course,\nthere are no strange valence quarks) [75]. This is valid because, at energy scales smaller than\nthe strange quark mass (or actually twice the strange quark mass, since the purely pionic\nsystems have no valence strange quarks), one can integrate out the strange quark. This is\nnot an approximation, because all of the effects of the strange quark are absorbed into a\nrenormalization of the parameters of the chiral Lagrangian. Moreover, since the 2 flavor\namplitude does not exhibit enhanced chiral logarithms, signatures of partial quenching can\nbe reduced by extrapolating lattice data with the 2 flavor, rather than the 2 + 1 flavor,\nexpression. We note that in this case the effects of the strange quark are absorbed in the\ncoefficients of the analytic terms appearing in Eq. (33), and thus they are not constant, but\n20\n\n\frather depend logarithmically upon the strange sea quark mass.\n\nV.\n\nI = 2 PION SCATTERING LENGTH RESULTS\n\nIn this section we present our results for the s-wave I = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering length in the two\ntheories most relevant to current mixed action lattice simulations: those with GW valence\nquarks and either Nf = 2 or Nf = 2 + 1 staggered sea quarks.

(38). As in the 2-flavor MA\u03c7PT expression,\nEq. (40), the only undetermined parameter is the linear combination of Gasser-Leutwyler\ncoefficients,  \u0304l\u03c0\u03c0 , which also appears in the continuum \u03c7PT expression.\nWe note as an aside that this suppression of lattice spacing counterterms is in contrast\nto the larger number of terms that one would need in order to correctly fit data from\nsimulations with Wilson valence quarks on Wilson sea quarks. Because the Wilson action\nbreaks chiral symmetry at O(a), even for massless quarks, there will be terms proportional\nto all powers of the lattice spacing in the expression for the scattering length in Wilson\n\u03c7PT [74, 76, 77]. Moreover, such lattice spacing corrections begin at O(a), rather than\n\nO(a2 ). If one uses O(a) improved Wilson quarks, then the leading discretization effects\n\nare of O(a2 ), as for staggered quarks; however, this does not remove the additional chiral\nsymmetry-breaking operators. Another practical issue is whether or not one can perform\nsimulations with Wilson sea quarks that are light enough to be in the chiral regime.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nConsiderable progress has recently been made in fully dynamical simulations of pion\nscattering in the I = 2 channel [29, 33]. We have considered I = 2 scattering of pions\ncomposed of Ginsparg-Wilson quarks on a staggered sea. We have calculated the scattering\nlength in both this mixed action theory and in continuum PQ\u03c7PT for theories with either\n22\n\n\f2 or 2 + 1 dynamical quarks. These expressions are necessary for the correct continuum and\nchiral extrapolation of PQ and mixed action lattice data to the physical pion mass.\nOur formulae, Eqs. (40), (42), not only provide the form for the mixed action scattering\nlength, but also contain two predictions relevant to the recent work of Ref. [29]. Beane\net. al. calculated the I = 2 s\u2212wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering length using domain wall valence quarks\nand staggered sea quarks, but used the continuum \u03c7PT expression to extrapolate to the\n(0)\n\nphysical quark masses. In Figure 2 of Ref. [29], which plots m\u03c0 a2 versus m\u03c0 /f\u03c0 , the fit of\nthe \u03c7PT expression to the lattice data overshoots the lightest pion mass point but fits the\nheavier two points quite well. This is interesting because Eq. (40) predicts a known, positive\n(0)\n \u0303 4 /(768f 4\u03c0 3 ). Accounting for this positive shift is equivalent to\nshift to m\u03c0 a of size \u2206\n2\n\nPQ\n\n\u03c0\n\nlowering the entire curve, and could therefore move the fit such that it goes between the\ndata points. This turns out, however, not to be the case. In Ref. [29], the valence and sea\n \u0303 2 = a2 \u2206I \u2243 (446 MeV)2 [5]. Despite the large\nquark masses are tuned to be equal, so \u2206\nPQ\n \u0303\nvalue of \u2206P Q , the predicted shift is insignificant, being an order of magnitude less than the\n(0)\n\nstatistical error. In Table I, we collect the predicted shifts to m\u03c0 a2 at the three pion masses\nused in Ref. [29]. We also list the magnitude of the ratio of these predicted shifts to the\nleading contribution to the scattering length, which turn out to be small, lending confidence\nto the power counting we have used, Eq. (11). The other more important prediction is\nthat there are no unknown corrections to the \u03c7PT formula for the scattering length arising\nfrom lattice spacing corrections or partial quenching through the order O(m2q ), O(a2 mq ) and\nO(a4 ). Therefore, to within statistical and systematic errors, the continuum \u03c7PT expression\n\nused by Beane et. al. to fit their numerical \u03c0\u03c0 scattering data [29] receives no corrections\nthrough the 1-loop level.\nThe central result of this paper is that the appropriate way to extrapolate lattice \u03c0\u03c0\nscattering data is in terms of the lattice-physical pion mass and decay constant rather than in\nterms of the LO parameters which appear in the chiral Lagrangian. When expressed in terms\n\u2032\nof the LO parameters, the scattering length depends upon 4 undetermined parameters, l\u03c0\u03c0\n,\n\nlP\u2032 Q , la\u2032 2 and CMix. In contrast, the scattering length expressed in terms of the lattice-physical\nparameters depends upon only one unknown parameter, l\u03c0\u03c0 , the same linear combination of\nGasser-Leutwyler coefficients which contributes to the scattering length in continuum \u03c7PT.\n\n23\n\n\fTABLE I: Predicted shifts to the scattering length computed in Ref.
