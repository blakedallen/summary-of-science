We present new examples of complete embedded self-similar surfaces under mean curvature flow by gluing a sphere and a plane. These surfaces\nhave finite genus and are the first examples of non-rotationally symmetric selfshrinkers in R3 . Although our initial approximating surfaces are asymptotic\nto a plane at infinity, the constructed self-similar surfaces are asymptotic to\ncones at infinity.\n\n1. introduction\nThis article is the third and last installment of a series of papers aiming at\nconstructing new examples of surfaces satisfying the self-shrinking equation for the\nmean curvature flow,\n(1)\n\nH\u0303 + X\u0303 * \u03bd = 0,\n\nwhere X\u0303 is the position vector, the function H\u0303 and the orientation of the unit\nnormal \u03bd are taken so that the mean curvature vector is given by H\u0303 = H\u0303\u03bd.\nIn [8], Huisken proved that if the growth of the second fundamental form |A|2 is\ncontrolled (type 1), the singularities of the mean curvature flow tend asymptotically\nto a solution to (1). The work on self-shrinking surfaces is therefore motivated by\na desire to better understand the regularity of the mean curvature flow. A long list\nof examples of self-shrinkers would help shed light on the behavior of the flow near\nits singularities; unfortunately, until now, there were only four known examples of\ncomplete embedded self-shrinking surfaces (in the Euclidean space E 3 ): a plane,\na cylinder, a sphere, and a shrinking doughnut [1]; although there is numerical\nevidence of many others [2][3].\nThe overarching idea in the three articles is to obtain new examples of selfshrinkers \u221a\nby desingularizing the intersection of two known examples (the sphere\nof radius 2 centered at the origin and a plane through the origin) using Scherk\nminimal surfaces. First, one constructs an initial approximate solution M\u0303 by fitting\nan appropriately bent and scaled Scherk surface \u03a3\u0303 in a neighborhood of the intersection, then one solves a perturbation problem in order to find an exact solution.\nThe method was successfully used by Kapouleas [10] and Traizet [23] to construct\nminimal surfaces, and by the author for self-translating surfaces under the mean\ncurvature flow [18] [20].\nThe main difficulty in these desingularizations lies in showing that the linearized\nequation L\u0303v := \u2206v + |\u00c3|2 v \u2212 X\u0303 * \u2207v + v = E can be solved on the initial surface M\u0303 .\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

In the first article [17], we\nstudy the linearized equation on the desingularizing surface \u03a3\u0303. The second article\nconcerns the outer plane P\u0303 (the plane with a central disk removed) and its main\nresult states that the Dirichlet problem for (1) on P\u0303 has a unique solution among\ngraphs of functions over P\u0303 with a controlled linear growth. In the present article,\nwe finish the construction by gluing the solutions to the linearized equations on the\ndifferent pieces to obtain a global solution with a standard method: we use cutoff functions to localize the inhomogeneous term to the different pieces, solve the\nlinearized equation on these pieces, glue the local solutions using cut-off functions\nagain, and iterate the process. However, the cut-off functions create errors and\nobtaining the right estimates for the iteration to converge requires a delicate and\nprecise construction of the initial approximate surfaces, which is the main focus of\nthis article.\nOnce the initial surfaces are constructed, the techniques from [10] can be readily\napplied, with one notable exception. In all the previous constructions [10], [23],\n[18], and [20], the surfaces converge exponentially to their asymptotic catenoids,\nplanes, or grim reapers respectively. But here, the self-shrinkers grow linearly at\ninfinity. In this article, we also refine previous estimates from [19] and define the\nappropriate Banach spaces of functions for the final fixed point theorem.\nThe author originally intended to desingularize the intersection of a cylinder and\na plane, inspired by the work of Kapouleas on minimal surfaces and Ilmanen's open\nproblem on the rigidity of the cylinder. In [9], Ilmanen conjectured that if one of\nthe ends of a self-shrinking surface is asymptotic to a cylinder, then the surface\nmust be the self-shrinking cylinder itself. At the time, Angenent suggested that the\ndesingularization of a cylinder and a plane could provide a counterexample. The\nproblem was harder than anticipated because of the asymptotic behavior along\nthe cylindrical ends and remains open. In the same set of lecture notes, Ilmanen\npredicted the existence of self-shrinking punctured saddles, which he called msaddles, and provided pictures for m = 1, 3, and 9. Theorem 1 below shows that\nthese m-saddles exist if m is large; the existence for m small is still an open problem.\nThe parameter m is the number of periods of a Scherk surface needed to wrap\naround the intersection circle. The m-saddle M\u0303m below therefore has 2m handles\nand genus m \u2212 1.\nTheorem 1. There exists a natural number m\u0304 so that for any natural number\nm > m\u0304, there exists a surface M\u0303m with the following properties:\n(i) M\u0303m is a complete smooth surface which satisfies the equation H\u0303 + X\u0303 *\u03bd = 0.\n(ii) M\u0303m is invariant under rotation of 180\u25e6 around the x\u0303-axis.\n(iii) M\u0303m is invariant under reflections across planes containing the z\u0303-axis and\nforming angles \u03c0/(2m) + k\u03c0/m, k \u2208 Z, with the x\u0303-axis.\n(iv) Let U = B2 \u2229 {z\u0303 > 0} be the open top half of the ball of radius 2. \u221a\nAs\nm \u2192 \u221e, the sequence of surfaces M\u0303m tends to the sphere of radius 2\ncentered at the origin on any compact set of U .\n(v) M\u0303m is asymptotic to a cone.\n\u221a\n(vi) If we denote by T the translation by the \u221a\nvector \u2212 2~ex , the sequence of\nsurfaces mT (M\u0303m ) = {(mx\u0303, m\u1ef9, mz\u0303) | (x\u0303 + 2~ex , \u1ef9, z\u0303) \u2208 M\u0303m } converges in\nC k to the original Scherk surface \u03a30 on compact sets, for all k \u2208 N.\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n3\n\nWe briefly sketch the proof below, highlighting the differences and similarities\nbetween this construction and the ones from [10] and [20].\nWe start by replacing a small neighborhood of the intersection circle by an\nappropriately bent Scherk surface to obtain embedded surfaces. However, instead\nof scaling down the Scherk surface by a factor \u03c4 where \u03c4 is a small positive constant,\nwe keep it in its natural scale so that the curvatures and second fundamental form\nstay bounded, and scale up the rest of the configuration by \u03c4 \u22121 . The equation to\nbe satisfied is then\n(2)\n\nH + \u03c4 2 X * \u03bd = 0.\n\nThese initial surfaces are embedded and will be our approximate solutions. The next\nand more difficult step consists in finding an exact solution among perturbations\nof the initial surfaces. More precisely, we perturb a surface by adding the graph\nof a small function v so the position vector X becomes Xv := X + v\u03bd. Denoting\nthe initial surface by M , its position vector by X, its unit normal vector by \u03bd, the\ngraph of v over M by Mv , its mean curvature by Hv , and its unit normal vector by\n\u03bdv , we have\nHv + \u03c4 2 Xv * \u03bdv = H + \u03c4 2 X * \u03bd + \u2206v + |A|2 v \u2212 \u03c4 2 X * \u2207v + \u03c4 2 v + Qv ,\nwhere A is the second fundamental form on M and Qv is at least quadratic in v,\n\u2207v, and \u22072 v. The surface Mv is a self-shrinker if\n(3)\n\nLv = \u2212H \u2212 \u03c4 2 X * \u03bd \u2212 Qv ,\n\nwhere Lv := \u2206v + |A|2 v \u2212 \u03c4 2 X * \u2207v + \u03c4 2 v. Once we can solve the equation Lv =\n\u2212H \u2212 \u03c4 2 X * \u03bd, we expect the quadratic term to be small so the solution v to (3)\ncould be obtained by iteration. Before we can solve the linearized equation Lv = E\non the initial surface M , we have to study its associated Dirichlet problem on the\nvarious pieces: the desingularizing surface \u03a3 (formed by a truncated bent Scherk\nsurface), the two rotationally symmetric caps C, the inner disk D, and the outer\nplane P.\nIn all of the previous constructions (and here also), the linear operator L has\nsmall eigenvalues on \u03a3. One way to deal with the presence of small eigenvalues\nis to restrict the class of possible perturbations and eigenfunctions by imposing\nsymmetries on all the surfaces considered. However, this method only works if\nthe initial configuration has the imposed symmetries and, in general, can not rule\nout all the troublesome eigenfunctions. A second complementary approach is to\ninvert the linear operator modulo the eigenfunctions corresponding to small or vanishing eigenvalues. In other words, one can add or subtract a linear combination\nof eigenfunctions to the inhomogeneous term of Lv = E in order to land in the\nspace perpendicular to the approximate kernel, where the operator has a bounded\ninverse. For an exact solution, one must be able to generate (or cancel) any linear combination of these eigenfunctions within the construction. The process is\ncalled unbalancing and consists in dislocating the Scherk surface so that opposite\nasymptotic planes are no longer parallel. Flexibility in the initial configuration is\nthe key to a successful construction. The terms unbalancing and flexibility were\nfirst introduced by Kapouleas and the reader can find a short discussion of them in\nthe survey article [11].\n\n\f4\n\nXUAN HIEN NGUYEN\n\n1.1. How this construction differs from previous ones. In [10] ([20]), the\nflexibility relies on the fact that the main equation H\u0303 = 0 (H\u0303 \u2212 ~ey * \u03bd = 0 resp.)\nis translation invariant, so the catenoidal ends (grim reaper ends resp.) could be\nshifted without creating errors. Moreover, since catenoids (grim reapers resp.)\nhave ends, one can, with careful planning, perform the required dislocation at the\nintersections so that all the small changes in position\u221abuild up toward loose ends.\nFor the case of self-shrinkers, the sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin is\nthe only sphere satisfying (1) so the apparent lack of flexibility has been a major\nimpediment in completing the desingularization of the sphere and the plane.\nThe unbalancing process requires one to consider the configuration of a sphere\nand a plane as part of a family of initial configurations in which the rotationally\nsymmetric caps meet the plane at various angles close to 90 degrees (see Figure 1\nfor a dramatized representation).\n\nFigure 1. A balanced initial configuration and an unbalanced one.\nRather than shifting the sphere up or down, which would create too much error,\nwe use a family of self-shrinking rotationally symmetric caps. In [1], Angenent\nshowed that rotationally symmetric self-shrinkers are generated by geodesics in the\nhalf-plane {(z\u0303, r\u0303) | r\u0303 \u2265 0} with metric\n(4)\n\nr\u03032 e\u2212(z\u0303\n\n2\n\n+r\u0303 2 )\n\n{(dz\u0303)2 + (dr\u0303)2 }.\n\nThe equation for these geodesics parametrized by arc length is given by the following\nsystem of ordinary differential equations:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2z\u0303 \u0307 = cos \u03b8,\n(5)\nr\u0303 \u0307 = sin \u03b8,\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\n\u03b8\u0307 = z\u0303 sin \u03b8 + 1r\u0303 \u2212 r\u0303 cos \u03b8,\nwhere \u03b8 is the tangent angle at the point (z\u0303, r\u0303).\nThe metric is degenerate, so generic geodesics will bounce off as they get close\nto the z\u0303-axis. To obtain smooth embedded caps for the construction, we have to\nselect only the geodesics that tend to the z\u0303-axis (and which will eventually become\nperpendicular to the z\u0303-axis). They form a one parameter family of solutions to\n(5) characterized by the initial conditions z\u03030 = c\u0303, r\u0303 = 0, and \u03b80 = \u03c0/2. Because\nof the metric, the existence and uniqueness of such solutions do not follow from\nstandard ODE methods but from the (un)stable manifold theorem. The flexibility\nhere comes from this one parameter family of rotationally symmetric self-shrinking\ncaps; and a prescribed unbalancing dictates which cap to select and the radius R\u0303\nof the intersection circle.\nThe asymptotic behavior of our self-shrinkers is also different from the previous\nconstructions in [10] and [20]. In both of these articles, the constructed examples\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n5\n\ntended exponentially fast to the asymptotic catenoids or grim reapers. In this\ncase, although the initial configurations all involve the x\u0303\u1ef9-plane, the constructed\nself-shrinkers are asymptotic to cones at infinity [19].\n1.2. How this construction is similar to previous ones. In [10] and [20], the\ndesingularizing surfaces were not only unbalanced but their wings were bent as well\nto ensure that the solutions to the linearized equation Lv = E could be adjusted\nto have exponential decay. The decay is crucial to control the error generated from\nthe cut-off functions when patching up the local solutions to the linearized equation\nto form a global solution. In this construction, we can impose an added invariance\nwith respect to the half-turn rotation about the x\u0303-axis, and this extra symmetry\nforces exponential decay on the solutions along the wings of the desingularizing\nScherk surface. The situation is similar to the one in [18] and we do not need any\nbending of the wings.\nAll the estimates and results about the linearized equation on the desingularizing\nsurface \u03a3 are obtained by arguments analogous to the ones in [10], although our\nconstruction is simpler because there is no bending. Indeed, the difference between\nequation (2) and H = 0 is of order \u03c4 and the respective linear operators also differ\nby terms of order at least \u03c4 . Since the proofs are very technical and not enlightening,\nwe will not repeat them in this article but just state the relevant properties. The\nreader who wishes more details can find some in [18], where we adapted all of the\nproofs for the equation H \u2212 \u03c4~ey * \u03bd = 0. At this point, we would like to warn the\nreader that this article is not self-contained and we rely on the reader's familiarity\nwith similar constructions, especially [10] or [18], for the proofs of Propositions 8\nand 15.\nOnce we define the correct Banach spaces of functions and norms to consider,\nthe few last steps in this article are similar to the ones from Kapouleas's. Namely,\nthe proof that the linearized equation on the initial surface M\u0303 can be solved modulo\na multiple of a well-chosen function follows the same lines as in Kapouleas' article.\nThe final fixed point argument is also similar. Because it would have been strange\nto stop the construction right before its conclusion, we have included these proofs\nfor the sake of completeness.\nAcknowledgments.

They have also pointed out that even though all the\nessential ideas and estimates were present in Section 5.4, the weighted H\u00f6lder norms\ndefined in the original version did not yield the compact embeddings necessary to\napply the Schauder Fixed Point Theorem. The error has been corrected in this\nversion with the addition of Definition 21 and Lemma 22.\nThe original version of this article contained an extra parameter \u03c6 for bending\nthe wings of the desingularizing surfaces. The imposed invariance under rotation\nof 180\u25e6 around the x\u0303-axis makes \u03c6 superfluous and the author has removed it.\nAfter completion of the original manuscript, the author learned that N. Kapouleas,\nS. Kleene, and N. M\u00f8ller have announced a similar result [12]. They tackled both\npoints mentioned in the previous two paragraphs correctly in their first version.\nRemark. The notation H\u0303 = H\u0303\u03bd (which makes \u03bd the unit inward normal\n\u221avector for\nconvex surfaces) and the particular scale (in which the sphere of radius 2 in E 3 is\n\n\f6\n\nXUAN HIEN NGUYEN\n\na solution to the self-shrinker equation) follow the conventions of the previous two\ninstallments [17] and [19]. The scale differs from the scale in Angenent [1], where\nthe sphere of radius 2 is self-shrinking. It is also worth noting that the orientation\nof our normal vector is opposite from the one chosen by Huisken in [8].\n1.3. Notation.\n\u2022 E 3 is the Euclidean three space equipped with the usual metric.\n\u2022 ~ex , ~ey and ~ez are the three coordinate vectors of E 3 .\n\u2022 We fix once and for all a smooth cut-off function \u03c8, which is increasing,\nvanishes on (\u2212\u221e, 1/3), and is equal to 1 on (2/3, \u221e). We define the\nfunctions \u03c8[a, b] : R \u2192 [0, 1] which transition from 0 at a to 1 at b by\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns\u2212a\n.\n\u03c8[a, b](s) = \u03c8\nb\u2212a\n\u2022 We often have a function s defined on the surfaces with values in R \u222a {\u221e}.\nIf V is a subset of such a surface, we use the notation\nV\u2264a := {p \u2208 V : s(p) \u2264 a},\n\nV\u2265a := {p \u2208 V : s(p) \u2265 a}.\n\n\u2022 \u03bdS , gS , AS , and HS denote, respectively, the oriented unit normal vector,\nthe induced metric, the second fundamental form, and the mean curvature\nof an immersed surface S in the Euclidean space E 3 .\n\u2022 Given a surface S in E 3 , which is immersed by X : S \u2192 E 3 and a C 1\nfunction \u03c3 : S \u2192 R, we call the graph of \u03c3 over S the surface given by\nthe immersion X + \u03c3\u03bd, and denote it by S\u03c3 . We often use X + \u03c3\u03bd and its\ninverse to define projections from S to S\u03c3 , or from S\u03c3 to S, respectively.\nWhen we refer to projections from S to S\u03c3 or from S\u03c3 to S, we always\nmean these projections.\n\u2022 Throughout this article, a surface with a tilde S\u0303 is a surface in the \"smaller\"\nscale, whereas a surface without a tilde denotes its \"larger\" version S =\n1\n3\n\u03c4 S\u0303 = {(x, y, z) \u2208 E | (\u03c4 x, \u03c4 y, \u03c4 z) \u2208 S\u0303}, where \u03c4 is a small positive constant. We also use these conventions for geometric quantities, for example,\nH is the mean curvature of S and H\u0303 is the mean curvature of S\u0303. However,\nthese notations apply only loosely to coordinates: we generally use x, y, z\nwhen we are working in a \"larger\" scale and x\u0303, \u1ef9, z\u0303 for objects in a \"smaller\"\nscale but these sets of coordinates are not necessarily proportional by a\nratio of \u03c4 .\n\u2022 We work with the following weighted H\u00f6lder norms:\nk\u03c6 : C k,\u03b1 (\u03a9, g, f )k := sup f \u22121 (x)k\u03c6 : C k,\u03b1 (\u03a9 \u2229 B(x), g)k,\nx\u2208\u03a9\n\nwhere \u03a9 is a domain, g is the metric with respect to which we take the\nC k,\u03b1 norm, f is the weight function, and B(x) is the geodesic ball centered\nat x of radius 1.\n2. Construction of the desingularizing surfaces\nWe introduce the Scherk minimal surface and describe how to unbalance, wrap,\nand bend it to obtain a suitable desingularizing surface. The parameter \u03c4 is a small\npositive constant which characterizes how much the desingularizing surface will be\nscaled to fit in the neighborhood of the intersection circle. Although we do not scale\nthe desingularizing surface in this section, \u03c4 still plays a role here as it determines\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n7\n\nthe radius of the circle around which the Scherk surface is wrapped, and how far\nwe truncate our surface.\n2.1. The Scherk surface. The Scherk minimal surface \u03a30 is given by the equation\n\u03a30 = {(x, y, z) \u2208 E 3 | sin y = sinh x sinh z}.\nThis surface was discovered by Scherk and is the most symmetric of a one parameter\nfamily of minimal surfaces (see [4], [13], or [14]). As x (z) goes to infinity, \u03a30 tends\nexponentially to the xy-plane (yz-plane resp.). More precisely, if we denote by H +\nthe closed half-plane H + = {(s, y) \u2208 R2 | s \u2265 0}, we have the following properties.\nLemma 2 (Proposition 2.4 [10]). For given \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 10\u22123 ), there are a constant\na = a(\u03b5) > 0 and smooth functions \u03c3 : H + \u2192 R and F : H + \u2192 E 3 with the\nfollowing properties:\n(i) F (s, y) = (\u03c3(s, y), y, s + a) \u2208 \u03a30 ,\n(ii) k\u03c3 : C 5 (H + , gH + , e\u2212s )k \u2264 \u03b5,\n(iii) \u03a30 is invariant under rotation of 180\u25e6 around the x-axis, and reflections\nacross the planes y = \u03c02 + k\u03c0, k \u2208 Z.\nThe constant \u03b5 is a small constant chosen at this point so a is also fixed. We call\nthe surface F (H + ) the top wing of \u03a30 , and its image under rotation of 180\u25e6 around\nthe y-axis is the bottom wing. The outer wing is the set of points {(s+a, y, \u03c3(s, y))}\nand the inner wing is {(\u2212s \u2212 a, y, \u03c3(s, y))}. We take as standard coordinates the\ncoordinates (s, y) on each of the wings. If a point of \u03a30 does not belong to any of\nthe wings, we take its s-coordinate to be zero.\n2.2. Unbalancing. Because the equation H +\u03c4 2 X *\u03bd = 0 is a perturbation of H =\n0, one expects that the respective linear operators Lv = \u2206v +|A|2 v \u2212\u03c4 2 X *\u2207v +\u03c4 2 v\nand Lv := \u2206v +|A|2 have similar properties. The mean curvature is invariant under\ntranslations, therefore the functions ~ex * \u03bd, ~ey * \u03bd, and ~ez * \u03bd are in the kernel of the\nlinear operator L associated to normal perturbations of H. We can rule out ~ey * \u03bd\nand ~ez * \u03bd by imposing symmetries (see (iii) of Lemma 2). The remaining function\n~ex * \u03bd does not have the required exponential decay, however, it indicates that L\nhas an approximate kernel generated by a function close to ~ex * \u03bd and one can only\nsolve the equation Lv = E with a reasonable estimate on v if E is perpendicular to\nthe approximate kernel. But we do not have such control over the inhomogeneous\nterm, so we have to introduce a function w to cancel any component parallel to the\napproximate\nkernel. The function w has to be in the direction of ~ex * \u03bd in the sense\nR\nthat w(~ex * \u03bd) 6= 0.\nLet S be one period of the desingularizing surface \u03a3. According to the balancing\nformula from [15], the mean curvature of \u03a3 satisfies\nZ\n4\nX\nH~ex * \u03bddgS = 2\u03c0\nvi * ~ex ,\nS\n\ni=1\n\nwhere vi is the direction of the plane asymptotic to the ith wing. The idea is to\ndefine w as a derivative of H and use unbalancing to move the top and bottom\nwings toward ~ex to generate a multiple of w.\n1\n1\nDefinition 3. For b \u2208 (\u2212 10\n, 10\n), we take a family of diffeomorphisms Zb : E 3 \u2192\nE 3 depending smoothly on b and satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) Zb is the identity in the region {(x, y, z) | |z| < 12 |x|},\n\n\f8\n\nXUAN HIEN NGUYEN\n\n(ii) in the region {(x, y, z) | |z| > 2|x| and |z| > 1}, Zb is the rotation by an\nangle b about the y-axis toward the positive x-axis,\n(iii) Z0 is the identity.\nWe denote by \u03a3b the unbalanced surface Zb (\u03a30 ) and push forward the coordinates (s, y) of \u03a30 onto this new surface using Zb .\n2.3. Wrapping the Scherk surface around a circle. Given R\u0303 \u2208 (1, 2), let\nR = \u03c4 \u22121 R\u0303 and define the maps \u03a6R : E 3 \u2192 E 3 by\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03a6R (x, y, z) = R ex/R cos(\u03c4 y/ 2), ex/R sin(\u03c4 y/ 2), z/R .\n\u221a\nWe allow R\u0303 to differ slightly from 2 so that it can be chosen to fit the self-shrinking\nrotationally symmetric caps in Section 4.2. The exponential factor ex/R has no real\nsignificance here and can be replaced by any strictly increasing diffeomorphism\nf : R \u2192 (0, \u221e) with the property f (0) = 1.\nWe push forward the coordinates (s, y) of \u03a30 onto the surface \u03a6R \u25e6 Zb (\u03a30 ). The\npiece of surface corresponding to {s \u2264 0} within the slab {\u2212a \u2264 z \u2264 a} is called\nthe core of the desingularizing surface and will no longer be modified. The image\nof the plane asymptotic to the top wing of \u03a3b is given by\nn\u0010\n\u0011\no\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(6)\nRez tan b/R cos(\u03c4 y/ 2), Rez tan b/R sin(\u03c4 y/ 2), z , z \u2265 a ,\nwhere we placed the boundary of the asymptotic surface at z = a to simplify\nsubsequent computations. In general, the piece of sphere given by (6) does not\nsatisfy the equation for self-shrinkers (1) and would generate too much error if it\nwere used to build the top wing. Instead, we record its boundary and conormal\ndirection in Definition 4 and equation (7), respectively, then choose a piece of\nrotationally self-shrinking surface these boundary conditions in Definition 5.\nDefinition 4. The circle that bounds the asymptotic surface given by (6) is called\nthe pivot of the top wing.\nWe define \u03b2 to be the angle the inward conormal vector makes with the direction\n~ez at the pivot, which is given by the equation\n(7)\n\ntan \u03b2 = (tan b)ea tan b/R .\n\nNote that \u03b2 is a smooth function of b and that 1 \u2212 C\u03c4 \u2264\npositive constant C.\n\nd\u03b2\ndb\n\n\u2264 1 + C\u03c4 for some\n\n1\n1\nDefinition 5. Given \u03c4 a small positive constant, b \u2208 (\u2212 10\n, 10\n) and R\u0303 \u2208 [1.3, 1.5],\nwe consider the solution (z\u0303(t), r\u0303(t), \u03b8(t)) to the system (5) with initial conditions\n\nz\u0303(0) = \u03c4 a,\n\nr\u0303(0) = R\u0303ea\u03c4 tan b/R\u0303 ,\n\n\u03b8(0) = \u03b2,\n\nwhere \u03b2 is given by (7). We define the map \u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] : H + \u2192 E 3 by\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\u0010\n\u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](s, y) =\nr\u0303(t(s)) cos(\u03c4 y/ 2), r\u0303(t(s)) sin(\u03c4 y/ 2), z\u0303(t(s)) ,\n\u03c4\n\u221a\ndt\nwhere we reparamatrize using t(s) satisfying ds\n= \u03c4 r\u0303(t)/ 2, t(0) = 0 so that\n\u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] is conformal.\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n9\n\nFrom standard ODE theory, the flow of (5) is smooth and depends smoothly on\nthe initial conditions. The surfaces \u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](H + ) are not embedded in general, but\nwe only consider the small pieces where 0 \u2264 s \u2264 5\u03b4s /\u03c4 , where the small positive\nconstant \u03b4s will be determined in Section 3. The pull-back of the induced metric\nby \u03ba is \u03c12 (ds2 + dy 2 ) where \u03c12 = r\u03032 /2.\n2.4. The inner and outer wings. The construction of these two wings is very\nsimple: we just use the transition function \u03c8[4\u03b4s /\u03c4, 3\u03b4s /\u03c4 ] \u25e6 s to cut off the graph\nof \u03c3 over these two wings, then truncate the desingularizing surface at s = 5\u03b4s /\u03c4 .\n2.5. The top and bottom wings. The top wing of our desingularizing surface\nis essentially the graph of \u03c3 from Lemma 2 over the self-shrinking rotationally\nsymmetric surface \u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](H + ). To get smooth transitions, we use the cut-off\nfunctions \u03c8[1, 0] and \u03c8s . The factor \u03c4 \u22121 in the scale of \u03c8s is to ensure that we cut\noff \u03c3 far enough as not to generate too much error, while \u03b4s is small in order to\ncontrol the geometry of the wings and so that the desingularizing surfaces fit in a\nsmall neighborhood of the intersection circle (in the original scale of (1)).\nDefinition 6. For given \u03c4, R\u0303, and b as in Definition 5, we define F [R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] : H + \u2192\nE 3 by\nF [R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](s, y) = \u03c8[1, 0](s)\u03a6R\u0303/\u03c4 \u25e6 Zb \u25e6 F (s, y)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03c8[1, 0](s) \u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](s, y) + \u03c8s (s)\u03c3(s, y)\u03bd[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](s, y) ,\nwhere \u03c8s is defined by \u03c8s (s) = \u03c8[4\u03b4s /\u03c4, 3\u03b4s /\u03c4 ](s) and \u03bd[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] is the Gauss map\nof \u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](H + ) chosen so that \u03bd[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](0, 0) = (cos(\u03b2), 0, \u2212 sin(\u03b2))\nThe top wing is divided into four regions:\n\u2022 {0 \u2264 s \u2264 1} is a transition region from the core to the bent wing.\n\u2022 on {1 \u2264 s \u2264 3\u03b4s /\u03c4 }, the wing is the graph of \u03c3 over the asymptotic\nrotationally symmetric piece of self-shrinker.\n\u2022 {3\u03b4s /\u03c4 \u2264 s \u2264 4\u03b4s /\u03c4 } is another transition region where we cut off the\ngraph of \u03c3.\n\u2022 on {4\u03b4s /\u03c4 \u2264 s}, the wing is a piece of rotationally symmetric self-shrinker.\nAs before, we push forward the coordinates (s, y) of H + onto F [R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](H + ) and\nclip the wing at s = 5\u03b4s /\u03c4 . The bottom wing is obtained by rotating the top wing\nby 180\u25e6 around the x-axis.\n2.6. The desingularizing surfaces. The desingularizing surface \u03a3[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] is composed of the core, the inner and outer wings, and the top and bottom wings defined\nin the three previous sections. We sometimes denote it by \u03a3 for simplicity. The\nnext proposition collects some useful properties of our desingularizing surfaces.\nProposition 7. There exists a constant \u03b4\u03c4 > 0 such that for \u03c4 \u2208 (0, \u03b4\u03c4 ), R\u0303 \u2208\n1\n1\n, 10\n), the surface \u03a3[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] satisfies the following properties:\n[1.3, 1.5], and b \u2208 (\u2212 10\n(i) \u03a3[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] is a smooth surface immersed in E 3 which depends smoothly on\nits parameters.\n\u221a\n(ii) If \u03c4 = m2 , m \u2208 N, the surface \u03a3[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] is embedded. Moreover, \u03a3[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ]\nis invariant under the rotation of 180\u25e6 around the x-axis and under the\n\u03c0\nreflections across planes containing the z-axis and forming angles 2m\n+ k\u03c0\nm,\nk \u2208 Z, with the xz-plane.\n\n\f10\n\nXUAN HIEN NGUYEN\n\nWe choose a positive integer m so that \u03c4 =\n\u03c4 for Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n\u221a\n\n2/m \u2208 (0, \u03b4\u03c4 ) and fix the value of\n\n3. Estimates on the desingularizing surfaces\nIn this section, we claim that the desingularizing surfaces \u03a3 are suitable approximate solutions. All the estimates from Section 4 in [10] are valid, with H replaced\nby H\u03a3 + \u03c4 2 X\u03a3 * \u03bd\u03a3 and the corresponding linear operator LS = \u2206S + |AS |2 replaced\nby LS = \u2206S + |AS |2 + \u03c4 2 (1 \u2212 X * \u2207). The factor \u03c4 2 combats the scale of the\nposition X \u223c \u03c4 \u22121 so the extra term does not add significantly. This is where we\nchoose the constant \u03b4s small enough so that the metrics g\u03a3 , \u03ba\u2217 (ds2 + dy 2 ), and\nF [R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ]\u2217 (ds2 + dy 2 ) are uniformly equivalent on the top and bottom wings. Later\non, in the proof of Proposition 15, \u03b4s may be changed to an even smaller constant\nso that the linear operator L\u03a3 on the wings can be treated as a perturbation of the\nLaplace operator on a flat cylinder. Because the proofs are technical and do not\nshowcase the main aspects of the construction, we will not reproduce them here.\nThe reader can find all the details in Section 4 of [10] or Section 3 of [18].\nIn what follows, the parameter \u03c4 and the radius R\u0303 are fixed and the dependence\non R\u0303 will be omitted. Moreover, because R\u0303 takes values in a compact set, all of the\nconstants C can be chosen independently of R\u0303.\nWe define the function w : \u03a30 \u2192 R by\nw :=\n\nd\ndb\n\nHb \u25e6 Z b ,\nb=0\n\nwhere Hb denotes the mean curvature on the surface Zb (\u03a30 ).\nThe main contribution to H\u03a3 +\u03c4 2 X\u03a3 *\u03bd\u03a3 comes from the unbalancing term (bw).\nHere \u03b3 is a constant in (0, 1) which indicates that the exponential decay is slower\ndue to the presence of the cut-off function \u03c8s in Definition 6.\nProposition 8. For (b, \u03c4 ) as in Proposition 7, the quantity H\u03a3 + \u03c4 2 X\u03a3 * \u03bd\u03a3 on\n\u03a3 = \u03a3[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] satisfies\nkH\u03a3 + \u03c4 2 X\u03a3 * \u03bd\u03a3 \u2212 bw : C 0,\u03b1 (\u03a3, g\u03a3 , e\u2212\u03b3s )k \u2264 C(\u03c4 + |b|2 ).\n4. Construction of the initial surfaces\nIn the construction of the desingularizing surfaces, we did not unbalance or\nbend the inner and outer wings so attaching them to a disk and plane respectively\nis straightforward. For the top and bottom wings, the story is more complicated.\nIn the case of minimal surfaces, coaxial catenoids form a two parameter family of\nminimal surfaces whose embeddings depend smoothly on the parameters. When\nthe desired tangent direction of a gluing wing is changed, one has the flexibility of\nattaching a catenoid close to the original\u221aone. To get flexibility in this construction,\nwe have to consider the sphere of radius 2 as a member of a family of self-shrinking\nsurfaces and not as a member of a family of spheres. Note that in [10], Kapouleas\nhad invariance for reflection across planes only, so he used a two-parameter family\nof initial configurations. Since we have an additional symmetry (invariance under\nrotation of 180\u25e6 around the x-axis), the family of self-shrinking surfaces depends\non one parameter only.\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n11\n\n4.1. A family of rotationally symmetric self-shrinking caps. In [1], Angenent showed that hypersurfaces of revolution are self-shrinkers if and only if they\nare generated by geodesics of the half-plane {(z\u0303, r\u0303) | r\u0303 \u2265 0} equipped with the\nmetric (4). Given any point (z\u0303, r\u0303) and an angle \u03b8 \u2208 R, there is a unique geodesic\nthrough (z\u0303, r\u0303) with tangent vector (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8). Such a geodesic parametrized by\narc length satisfies the following system of ODEs\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2z\u0303 \u0307 = cos \u03b8,\n(5)\nr\u0303 \u0307 = sin \u03b8,\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\n\u03b8\u0307 = z\u0303 sin \u03b8 + 1r\u0303 \u2212 r\u0303 cos \u03b8.\nBecause the metric becomes degenerate as r\u0303 \u2192 0, geodesics in general will bounce\noff as they approach the z\u0303-axis. For the purpose of having a complete rotationally\nsymmetric cap, we will only consider geodesics that tend towards the z\u0303-axis.

Its unstable manifold consists of a one parameter family of orbits\n\u03b1\u0303c , each \u03b1\u0303c emanating from the point (c, 0, \u03c0/2). The short-time existence and\nuniqueness of these orbits \u03b1\u0303c , as well as the smoothness of the unstable manifold is\ngiven by the (un)stable manifold theorem (see Theorem (4.1) [7] or Theorem III.8\n[21]). Once we get away from the line l using this first step, we can extend the one\nparameter family of orbits \u03b1\u0303c smoothly\n\u221a using standard ODE theory. The uniform\ndependence of (z\u0303, r\u0303, \u03b8) for t \u2208 [0, 3\u03c0/ 2] is obtained by a compactness argument\nsince the system (5) is not singular for r\u0303 away from zero.\n\u0003\nProposition 11.

Fitting the self-shrinking caps to the desingularizing surfaces. Let us\nrecall that in Section 2, we did not restrict ourselves to geodesics that meet the z\u0303axis perpendicularly but considered any solution to (5) to construct the asymptotic\nsurfaces \u03ba[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ](H + ). We now choose the radius R\u0303 in function of the angle b so\nthat the surface asymptotic to the top wing of \u03a3 is contained in a self-shrinking\nrotationally symmetric cap. Given b, we take R\u0303(b) to be the c1 given in Corollary\n12 corresponding to \u03b81 = \u03b2, where \u03b2 is given by (7).\n\u221a\n4.3. Construction of the initial surfaces M\u0303 (b, \u03c4 ). Let us recall that \u03c4 = 2/m \u2208\n(0, \u03b4\u03c4 ), for a previously chosen integer m. We fix a constant \u03b6 which will be determined in the proof of Theorem 1.\nGiven b \u2208 [\u2212\u03b6\u03c4, \u03b6\u03c4 ], we start the construction of the initial surface by taking the\ndesingularizing surface \u03a3[R\u0303(b), b, \u03c4 ] and shrinking it to \u03a3\u0303 = \u03a3\u0303[R\u0303(b), b, \u03c4 ] with the\nhomothety H of ratio \u03c4 centered at the origin. We top off (on the top and bottom)\nthe desingularizing surface \u03a3\u0303 with self-shrinking caps generated by rotating the\ncurve \u03b3\u0303c(b) around the z\u0303-axis. The inner wing of \u03a3\u0303 is attached to a flat disk and\nthe outer wing to a plane.\nDefinition 13. The surface constructed in the above paragraph is denoted by\nM\u0303 (b, \u03c4 ). We push forward the function s by H from \u03a3 to \u03a3\u0303 and extend it to\nthe whole surface M\u0303 (b, \u03c4 ) by taking s = 5\u03b4s /\u03c4 on M\u0303 \\ \u03a3\u0303.\nLet a := 8| log \u03c4 |.

Given a positive integer m so that \u03c4 = 2/m \u2208 (0, \u03b4\u03c4 ) and\nb \u2208 [\u2212\u03b6\u03c4, \u03b6\u03c4 ], the surface M\u0303 = M\u0303 (b, \u03c4 ) is well defined by the construction above\nand satisfies the following properties:\n(i) M\u0303 is a complete smooth embedded surface which depends smoothly on (b).\n(ii) M\u0303 is invariant under rotation of 180\u25e6 around the x\u0303-axis.\n(iii) M\u0303 is invariant under the action of the group G generated by reflections\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nacross the planes containing the z\u0303 axis and forming an angle of 2m\n+km\n,\nk \u2208 Z with the x\u0303z\u0303-plane.\n(iv) As m \u2192 \u221e, the sequence of initial surfaces M\u0303 (b, \u03c4 ) converges\nuniformly in\n\u221a\nC k , for all k \u2208 N, to the union of a sphere of radius 2 and the x\u0303\u1ef9-plane\non any compact subset of the complement of the intersection\ncircle.\n\u221a\n(v) Let us denote by T the translation by the vector \u2212 2~ex .

The linearized equation\n \u0303 D\u0303, and P\u0303 and\nWe study the linearized equations on the various pieces \u03a3, C,\nfind appropriate estimates for the solutions. The linearized equation on the whole\nsurface M is solved by using cut-off functions to restrict ourselves to the various\npieces and patching up all these local solutions with an iteration process.\n5.1. The linearized equation on \u03a3. The linear equation L\u03a3 v = \u2206\u03a3 v + |A\u03a3 |2 v +\n\u03c4 2 v \u2212 \u03c4 2 X * \u2207v = E on \u03a3 = \u03a3[R\u0303, b, \u03c4 ] can be solved modulo the addition of a\nmultiple of w on the right hand side, which takes care of small eigenvalues of L. The\nnext proposition is reminiscent of Proposition 7.1 in [10] but the proof is simpler.\nIn our case, the group of imposed symmetries is larger and is used to rule out\ntroublesome linear growth for solutions of \u2206v = E (or Lv = E). The exponential\ndecay is therefore achieved without resorting to any bending or adjustment along\nthe wings. Proposition 15 below is similar to Corollary 22 in [18]. Because one can\nprove it by following the steps in [18] and simply substituting the linear operator,\nwe do not give details of the proof here, only the main ideas.\nProposition 15. Given E 0 \u2208 C 0,\u03b1 (\u03a3), there are bE 0 \u2208 R and vE 0 \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (\u03a3) such\nthat:\n(i) bE 0 and vE 0 are uniquely determined by the proof,\n(ii) L\u03a3 vE 0 = E 0 + bE 0 w on \u03a3 and vE 0 = 0 on \u2202\u03a3,\n(iii) |bE 0 | \u2264 CkE 0 k, where kE 0 : C 0,\u03b1 (\u03a3, g\u03a3 , e\u2212\u03b3s )k,\n(iv) kvE 0 : C 2,\u03b1 (\u03a3, g\u03a3 , e\u2212\u03b3s )k \u2264 CkE 0 k.\nSketch of the proof. It suffices to prove the result for the operator L0 = \u2206\u03a30 +|A\u03a30 |2\non the piece of the original Scherk surface \u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4 . Indeed, because \u03c4 and \u03b4s are\nsmall constants, one period of our desingularizing surface \u03a3 is diffeomorphic to\n\u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4 , their respective metrics are uniformly equivalent, and we can control\n|A\u03a3 |2 \u2212 |A\u03a30 |2 . Moreover, the linear operator L\u03a3 on the wings can be treated as\na perturbation of the Laplace operator on long flat cylinders (of length l = 5\u03b4s /\u03c4 )\nbecause l2 |A\u03a3 |2 is small if \u03b4s is small.\nThe first step is to show that the linear operator L0 on \u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4 is Fredholm\nof index \u22121. Here, when we say \"the operator L0 on a surface S \u2282 \u03a30 \", we consider L0 as an operator from the space C02,\u03b1 (S, g0 , e\u2212\u03b3s ) of exponentially decaying\nC 2,\u03b1 functions with vanishing boundary conditions on \u2202S to C 0,\u03b1 (S, g0 , e\u2212\u03b3s ). To\ncompute the Fredholm index, we use a Mayer-Vietoris-type argument. We split\n\u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4 into its four wings and a slightly bigger core, \u03a30,\u22642 , and show that the\nFredholm index on the whole surface is the sum of the indices on each piece minus\nthe sum of the indices on the overlaps.\nThe overlaps are cylinders of length 2. Like the Laplace operator, L0 is invertible\nand has index 0. On the wings, L0 can also be compared to the Laplacian, but the\nsituation is more complicated because of the exponential decay. A computation with\nFourier series shows that the exponentially decaying solution to \u2206v(s, y) = E(s, y),\nv|s=5\u03b4s /\u03c4 = 0 vanishes at s = 0 if and only if\nZ l Z 2\u03c0\n(9)\nsE(s, y)dyds = 0.\n0\n\n0\n\nBecause all the surfaces are invariant under rotation of 180\u25e6 around the x-axis,\nthe condition (9) is satisfied on the inner and outer wings. Also, functions on the\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n15\n\nbottom wings are tied to functions on the top wings so the Fredholm index of L0\non the union of the four wings is \u22121.\nThe Scherk surface is a minimal surface; therefore the Gauss map \u03bd : \u03a30 \u2192 S 2\nis conformal. It sends \u03a30,\u22642 to the sphere minus four discs centered at (\u00b11, 0, 0)\nand (0, 0, \u00b11), and the pull-back \u03bd \u2217 gS 2 of the metric on S 2 is \u03bd \u2217 gS 2 = 12 |A\u03a30 |2 g0 .\nThis means that a function on \u03a30 is in the kernel of L if its pushforward by the\nGauss map is in the kernel of \u2206gS2 + 2 on the sphere. For domains U \u2282 S 2 with\nsmooth boundary, the Laplace operator from {f \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (U ) | f |\u2202U = 0} to C 0,\u03b1 (U )\nis invertible. The addition of a compact operator does not change the index, so\n\u2206 + 2 on U and L0 on \u03a30,\u22642 both have index 0.\nThe operator L on \u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4 therefore has index \u22121. Without the additional\nsymmetry, the index would be \u22124. We would need to insert more parameters in\nthe construction of the initial surface to account for the bigger cokernel, hence the\nbending of the wings. The bending is there to cancel possible linear contributions\nfrom the kernel of \u2206 on each wing. If the original configuration has the extra halfturn symmetry as in this case or the case a plane and a grim reaper in [18], it is\nnot needed.\nLet us recall that L is the linear operator associated to normal perturbations of\nthe mean curvature by graphs of functions. Because the mean curvature is invariant\nwhen a surface is translated, the functions ~ex * \u03bd, ~ey * \u03bd, and ~ez * \u03bd are in the kernel of\nL. We can rule out the last two with the imposed symmetries on \u03a30 , namely that\nany perturbation of \u03a30 should be invariant under rotation of 180\u25e6 around the x-axis\nand reflections across the planes y = \u03c02 + k\u03c0, k \u2208 Z. The remaining one, ~ex * \u03bd, does\nnot decay exponentially, so it is not in the kernel. Nevertheless, it plays a role here\nin characterizing the cokernel: the map \u03a6 : C 0,\u03b1 (\u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4 , g0 , e\u2212\u03b3s ) \u2192 R defined\nby\nZ\n\u03a6(h) =\nh(e1 * \u03bd)d\u03bc,\n\u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4\n\nwhere d\u03bc is the Hausdorff measure on \u03a30 , vanishes on the range of L and \u03a6(w) 6= 0.\nThe cokernel therefore has dimension 1 and the kernel is trivial. Given a function\nE 0 , one can take bE 0 = \u2212\u03a6(E 0 )/\u03a6(w) and find a solution v to the Dirichlet problem\nLv = E 0 + bE 0 w, v = 0 on \u2202\u03a30,\u22645\u03b4s /\u03c4 .\n\u0003\n \u0303 Because this surface is in the\n5.2.

Let S2 be the standard 2-sphere and S be the sphere of radius 2, both\nequipped with the metrics induced by their respective embeddings into E 3 . The\nlinear operator of interest on S is L\u0303S = \u2206S + |AS |2 + 1 = 12 \u2206S2 + 2. The existence\nof a unique solution satisfying the estimate above is standard on a hemisphere of\nS thanks to the study of eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on the unit sphere S2\n(see for example [22]). We obtain the result for L\u0303C\u0303 by treating C \u0303 as a perturbation\nof a hemisphere of S.\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nXUAN HIEN NGUYEN\n\n5.3. The linearized equation on the inner disk D\u0303. The existence of a solution\nfor the Dirichlet problem L\u0303v = E, v|\u2202 D\u0303 = 0 with estimates similar to the ones in\nProposition 16 follows from standard theory in PDEs.\n5.4. The linearized equation on the outer plane P\u0303. Let R\u0304 = R\u0303e\u03c4 (a+a)/R\u0303 . We\ndenote by BR\u0304 \u2282 R2 the disk of radius R\u0304 centered at the origin and by \u03a9 := R2 \\BR\u0304\nthe plane with the disk of radius R\u0304 removed. Because P\u0303 only differs from \u03a9 in a\nsmall neighborhood of the boundary, any results and estimates we obtain for the\nsolution to the linearized equation L\u0303\u03a9 v = E are also valid for the solution to the\nlinearized equation on P\u0303 by using perturbation theory.\nThe preliminary estimates from [19] show that if the nonhomogeneous term\nE decays as r\u22121 , where r is the distance to the origin, then the solution v of\nthe linearized equation on \u03a9 has linear growth, bounded gradient, and a Hessian\ndecaying as r\u22121 . We emphasize the fact that v is not bounded but is asymptotic\nto a cone at infinity. The weighted norms below and in Definition 21 capture this\ninformation.\nr,\u03b1\nLet \u03be be a point in a region N .

In Lemma 5 and Theorem 7 of [19], we showed the existence and uniqueness\nof a weak solution v (note that the roles of u's and v's are swapped in the mentioned\narticle). The operator is elliptic, so a weak solution is also a strong smooth solution\nin \u03a9.\nWe now prove the estimate on kv : C\u22172,\u03b1 (\u03a9)k. Let us first recall how to obtain\n2\nthe bounds on |v|. Since 1 \u2212 2R\u03042 < 0, the function vk = k(r \u2212 R\u0304r ) with r = |\u03be| is\na supersolution and satisfies\nR\u03042\nk\n+ (1 \u2212 2R\u03042 ) \u2264 E.\nr3\nr\nfor k \u2265 sup\u03be\u2208\u03a9 (|E(\u03be)||\u03be|/(1 \u2212 2R\u03042 )).

Using the\nL\u0303vk = \u2212k\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n17\n\nsymmetries and the maximum principle on a sector (Theorem 7 [19]), we get\n|v(\u03be)| \u2264 k|\u03be|.\n\n(11)\n\nUsing the standard theory of functions in H\u00f6lder spaces, we can extend a function\nv \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (\u03a9) to a function v 0 in C 2,\u03b1 (R2 ) in such a way that\nkv 0 : C 2,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1 )k \u2264 Ckv : C 2,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1 \u2229 \u03a9)k,\nwhere the constant C is independent of v. Let us fix once and for all such an\nextension. We define E 0 to be L\u0303v 0 . The advantage of working with functions on\nR2 is that the heat equation (15) below is now defined on the whole space. We can\nthen use the well-known heat kernel for R2 .\nBefore tackling the heat equation, we need to show that\nkE 0 : C\u22170,\u03b1 (R2 )k \u2264 CkE : C\u22170,\u03b1 (\u03a9)k.\n\n(12)\n\nBy definition, we have E 0 = E on \u03a9 and\nkE 0 : C 0,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1 )k \u2264 Ckv 0 : C 2,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1 )k \u2264 Ckv : C 2,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1 \u2229 \u03a9)k).\nBecause v = 0 on \u2202\u03a9, boundary estimates for linear elliptic equations (see Lemmas\n6.4 and 6.5 in [6] for example) give a \u03b4 > 0 for which\n(13)\n\nkv : C 2,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+\u03b4 \u2229 \u03a9)k \u2264 C(kv : C 0 (BR\u0304+1 \u2229 \u03a9)k + kE : C 0,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1 \u2229 \u03a9)k).\n\nBy Schauder interior estimates, we have\n(14)\nkv : C 2,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1 \\ BR\u0304+\u03b4 )k \u2264 C(kv : C 0 (BR\u0304+1+\u03b4 \u2229 \u03a9)k + kE : C 0,\u03b1 (BR\u0304+1+\u03b4 \u2229 \u03a9)k,\nwhere C depends on \u03b4.

Let\n\u039e = {(b, u) \u2208 R \u00d7 \u03c7 : |b| \u2264 \u03b6\u03c4, kuk2 \u2264 \u03b6\u03c4 },\n\n\fSELF-SIMILAR SURFACES UNDER MCF III\n\n25\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a large constant to be determined below. The map I : \u039e \u2192 R \u00d7 \u03c7 is\ndefined as follows. Given (b, u) \u2208 \u039e, let v = u \u25e6 Db\u22121 , M\u0303 = M\u0303 (b) and let M\u0303v be the\ngraph of v over M\u0303 . We define the function F : R \u00d7 C 2,\u03b1 (M\u0303 , gM\u0303 , e\u2212\u03b3s ) \u2192 R by\nF(b, v) = H\u0303v + X\u0303v * \u03bdv ,\nwhere H\u0303v and \u03bdv are the mean curvature and the oriented unit normal of M\u0303v ,\nrespectively pulled back to M\u0303 . Proposition 25 asserts that\nkF(b, v) \u2212 F(b, 0) \u2212 L\u0303M\u0303 vk0 \u2264 C\u03b6 2 \u03c4 2 .\nApplying Theorem 24 with E = F(b, v) \u2212 F(b, 0) \u2212 L\u0303M\u0303 v, we obtain vE and bE such\nthat\nL\u0303M\u0303 vE = E + \u0398(bE ),\nkvE k2 \u2264 C\u03b6 2 \u03c4 2 ,\n\n|bE | \u2264 C\u03b6 2 \u03c4 2 .\n\nHence,\nF(b, v) = F(b, 0) + L\u0303M\u0303 v + L\u0303M\u0303 vE \u2212 \u0398(bE ).\nPropositions 7 and 8, and Theorem 24 give us vH and bH satisfying L\u0303M\u0303 vH =\nF(b, 0) + \u0398(bH ), so\nF(b, v) = L\u0303M\u0303 v + L\u0303M\u0303 vH + L\u0303M\u0303 vE \u2212 \u0398(bE + bH ).\nWe define the map I : \u039e \u2192 R \u00d7 \u03c7 by\nI(b, u) = (b \u2212 bE \u2212 bH , (\u2212vE \u2212 vH ) \u25e6 Db ).\nWe now arrange for I(\u039e) \u2282 \u039e. Since\nk \u2212 vE \u2212 vH k2 \u2264 C(\u03c4 + \u03b6 2 \u03c4 2 ),\n|b \u2212 bE \u2212 bH | \u2264 C(\u03c4 + \u03b6 2 \u03c4 2 ),\nwe can choose \u03b6 > 2C and \u03c4 < \u03b6 \u22122 in order to get C(\u03c4 + \u03b6 2 \u03c4 2 ) < \u03b6\u03c4 .\nThe set \u039e is clearly convex. It is a compact set of R \u00d7 X from the choice of the\nH\u00f6lder exponent \u03b10 < \u03b1. The map I is continuous by construction therefore we\ncan apply the Schauder Fixed Point Theorem (p. 279 in [6]) to obtain a fixed point\n\u22121\n(b\u03c4 , u\u03c4 ) of I for every \u03c4 \u2208 (0, \u03b4\u03c4 ) with \u03b4\u03c4 small enough. The graph of v = u\u03c4 \u25e6 Db,\u03c4\nover the surface M\u0303 (b\u03c4 , \u03c4 ) is then a self-shrinking surface. It is a smooth surface by\nthe regularity theory for elliptic equations. The properties (ii) and (iii) follow from\nthe construction.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] S. B.
