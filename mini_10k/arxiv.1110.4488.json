The theory analyzes the onebody motion of electrons through a crystal and obtains their wavefunctions as Bloch states dependent on a crystal\nmomentum which takes values in a space equivalent to a d-dimensional torus (in d dimensions). Insulators hold a\nspecial place in band theory: at a first look, they are its most boring aspect, having a full gap between occupied and\nunoccupied bands, no low-energy excitations, and hence no interesting properties at zero temperature. This viewpoint\npermeated the physics of much of the last century, but is, as we now know, untrue. The space of the eigenvectors of\nthe Bloch Hamiltonians can be thought of as a unitary matrix, which in the case of insulators exhibits several gauge\nsymmetries related to permutations of the occupied and un-occupied bands, thereby creating a complex manifold.\nThe Hamiltonians can be regarded as maps from the Brillouin zone (BZ) to these manifolds, which, as mathematics\nteaches us, can be nontrivial. Anytime an insulator with a nontrivial map (Hamiltonian) is placed in the vicinity of\nthe vacuum, gapless edge or surface states appear on the boundary and cross the energy space between the valence and\nconduction band. One of the first examples of such behavior was Haldane's Chern insulator model on the graphene\nlattice [1]. This model exhibits the physics of the Integer Quantum Hall (IQH) effect but does not have an overall\napplied magnetic field, thereby preserving the translational symmetry of the initial lattice. The IQH does not require\nany discrete symmetry to exist. The field of topological insulators has further evolved to include other symmetries\nsuch as time-reversal [2\u20134], charge conjugation and point-group symmetries.\nMost of the research on topological insulators has focused on one-body electron Bloch physics. While several\ninteresting works on insulators with interactions exist [5\u20137], most of them focus on obtaining a mean-field state with\ntopological properties through interactions. Recently, it has been proposed and substantiated [8\u201310] that fractionally\nfilled bands of Chern insulators at 1/3 and 1/5 filing can exhibit an incompressible state in the same universality\nclass as the Abelian 1/3 and 1/5 Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states. This state was dubbed the Fractional\nChern Insulator (FCI). Its appearance is quite surprising, as the FQH and FCI problems vary considerably in several\nimportant ways, in the lack of a constant Berry curvature in the FCI, its large lattice filling, the absence of holomorphic\nand anti-holomorphic (z, z \u2217 ) structures in the lowest band and the presence of Umklapp processes that favor density\nwave states.\nIn a previous paper[8] we have shown that the groundstate of the interacting 1/3 fractionally filled band with\nChern number 1 of the checkerboard Hamiltonian supports a 3-fold degenerate groundstate separated by a gap from\nthe excited states and which is a featureless liquid with momentum orbital occupation number 1/3. We showed\nthat the spectrum of quasiholes (spectrum at lower filling) by a gap separated into two manifolds: a high energy\n\n\f2\nuninteresting set of spurious states, and a low-energy set of quasiholes whose counting empirically matches that of the\nquasihole states in an Abelian \u03bd = 1/3 filling FQH state. Similar results were obtained for the particle entanglement\nspectrum [11], a procedure used to obtain the topological part of the excitation spectrum directly from the groundstate\nwavefunction [12]. In the FCI, we have empirically found that the counting of states in the lower energy manifold, be\nthey groundstates or quasiholes, exhibits a peculiar, yet un-determined structure. On a finite size Nx \u00d7 Ny lattice, a\ntranslationally\ninvariant Hamiltonian\nfor Ne electrons has a spectrum classified by total many-body lattice momenta\nPNe\nPNe\nk\n(\nmod 2\u03c0), with each particle momentum kix,y taking values 2\u03c0j/Nx , 2\u03c0l/Ny ,\nk\n(\nmod\n2\u03c0)\nand\niy\nix\ni=1\ni=1\nj = 1 . . . Nx , l = 1 . . . Ny . We have found that the counting of states in the low energy (or entanglement energy)\nmanifold per momentum sector exhibits multiple degeneracies, although the states themselves are not degenerate there are no other exact degeneracies besides the point-group enforced ones, such as inversion. In many cases, we\nhave found that an empirical Pauli principle borrowed from the FQH physics can sometimes (but not always) explain\nthe degeneracies observed. While the degeneracy of some model wavefunctions has been worked out for the FQHE\non a lattice [13], these results cannot be applied to the FCI.\nOur prior analysis strongly suggests the existence of an emergent symmetry for FCI's at rational filling factors. In\nthe present manuscript we show that such a symmetry is a many-body translational symmetry of the type exactly\npresent in the FQH effect. We show analytically that, if the FCI state is in the same phase as the FQH state\n(including in the presence of quasiholes), the spectrum separates into quasi-degenerate center of mass sectors which\nexhibit identical counting. Within each center of mass sector, the Hamiltonian eigenstates can be further classified as\neigenstates of an emergent (in the thermodynamic limit) set of many-body relative translation operators. Using the\nrecently obtained Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP)[14] algebra for Chern insulators [15] for the one-body density\noperators in the valence band, we build a set of many-body relative translational operators which diagonalize the\nHamiltonian eigenstates in the lower manifold in the thermodynamic limit. We then establish an analytic mapping\nbetween the counting of zero-mode states in the FQH 2-D BZ on the torus (quasiholes) and that of the FCI levels in\nthe low-energy manifold. We show that the counting of quasi-degenerate levels below the gap for the FCI should arise\nfrom a folding of the zero-mode states in the Fractional Quantum Hall system at identical filling factor. In the process,\nwe show how to count and separate the quasihole excitations of the Read-Rezayi (RR)[16] series in the Fractional\nQuantum Hall effect into two-dimensional BZ momentum sectors, and then how to map these into the momentum\nsectors of the FCI. We provide numerical verification for our analytic results by checking the emergent symmetry\nat work for Laughlin[17], Moore-Read (MR)[18] and RR[16] states on the checkerboard model of a Chern insulator:\nwe predict, from the FQH quasihole counting plus our FQH to FCI analytic mapping, the number of non-Abelian\nquasiholes per momentum sector in the FCI, and then check that it matches the numerical data obtained by exact\ndiagonalization for large system sizes. Our work then also shows, as a proof of principle, that Non-Abelian FCIs exist.\nThe emergence of the low-manifold of states with folded FQH counting can be regarded as both a consequence as well\nas an imprint of the existence of the topological phase. Its existence is rather mysterious, as the Girvin-MacDonaldPlatzman one-body algebra from which the many-body generators are built is not valid at large momentum [15] and\nis not in one-to-one mapping with the algebra of the continuum FQH problem.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we analyze the interacting Landau level problem on the torus in the\ncontinuum and obtain the set of many-body relative and center of mass symmetries that can classify the interacting\nspectrum by two-dimensional BZ of N \u00d7 N momenta where N = GCD(N\u03c6 , Ne ). GCD stands for greatest common\ndenominator, N\u03c6 is the number of fluxes that pierce the FQH torus due to the presence of the magnetic field, while Ne\nis the number of electrons. This section has no new material, most of the end results having been obtained by Haldane\nin a classic PRL [19], but it does derive the physical equations in much greater level of detail. We then re-formulate\nthe translational symmetry in terms of density operators, allowing a closer analogy with the FCI. We also explicitly\nshow how to implement the many-body symmetries to build the FQH Hilbert space. Section 2 describes the counting\nof the zero modes of several pseudopotential Hamiltonians per two dimensional BZ momentum. We focus on the\nRead-Rezayi series and show how the generalized Pauli principle that allows the counting of the quasihole states in\nthe one-dimensional orbital space on the torus can be tuned to give the counting of zero modes in the two-dimensional\nBZ. As such, resolving the zero-modes (quasiholes) of model Haldane pseudopotential Hamiltonians in the 2D BZ\nbecomes a combinatorics problem of counting partitions. In Section 3 we first re-derive the commutator algebra of\nthe projected densities in the lowest band of the Chern insulator on a Nx \u00d7 Ny lattice first derived in [15] which\nreduces, in the long wavelength limit to the GMP algebra for the FQH effect for N\u03c6 = Nx * Ny . We show that the\nnon-commutativity of the projected densities which gives rise to the GMP algebra is a requirement in the Chern\ninsulator, while in the trivial insulator the projected densities are adiabatically continuable to commuting variables\nin the atomic limit. We then show that the existence of a GMP algebra superimposed on a lattice of Nx \u00d7 Ny sites\nimplies the existence of many-body relative translational operators which classify many-body states by a 2-dimensional\nmomentum in a reduced BZ of GCD(Nx , Ne ) \u00d7 GCD(Ny , Ne ) momenta. If the FCI phase is identical to that of the\n\n\f3\nFQH, there is an emergent, center of mass degeneracy of Nx /GCD(Nx , Ne ) in the x direction and Ny /GCD(Ny , Ne )\nin the y direction. We show that the counting of states in lower energy manifold of the FCI is a folding of the\ncounting of zero-modes in the N \u00d7 N BZ of the FQH times the difference between the center of mass degeneracies.\nWe establish the analytic mapping between the FQH and FCI counting, and give several examples of this counting for\nseveral Abelian and non-Abelian RR states based on the generalize Pauli principle. We refer the reader versed in FQH\ntranslational symmetries to read this section and look at Figures[2, 3, 4] for a simple understanding of how the FQHFCI map works. In section 4 we engage in extensive numerical calculations of both energy and entanglement spectra\nthat show the existence of Laughlin, MR and Z3 RR states on the checkerboard model [20] of the Chern insulator. We\nthen show that the counting of quasihole states per momentum sector obtained in numerics matched the one derived\nby our analytic map for all our large set of data and parameters (lattice aspect ratios, electron numbers) tried. Up\nto the largest sizes available on today's computers, the numerical data supports our analytic result.\nMANY-BODY SYMMETRIES OF THE INTERACTING ELECTRONS IN A MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nIn this section, we aim to analyze the symmetries of the interacting Hamiltonian of electrons on a two-dimensional\ntorus in the presence of a magnetic field and electron-electron interactions:\nN\n\nN\n\ne\ne\n1X\n1 X\n\u03a02j +\nV (~ri \u2212 ~rj )\nH=\n2m j\n2\n\n(1)\n\ni6=j\n\nwith \u03a0j = \u2212i~\u2207j \u2212 eA(rj ) = \u2212i~\u2207j + |e|A(rj ) the canonical momentum in the presence of a magnetic field.

A perfectly good\n~\ntranslational operator could be ei~a*\u03a0 - which would translate the single-body wavefunction by ~a.

This algebra leads\nto the quantization of flux passing through the lattice: going around the unit cell must give us the identity (same\n~ 1, L\n~ 2 translations must commute). This GMP algebra arises in several contexts in the\ncondition as commutators of L\nquantum Hall effect and has the interpretation of a quantum deformation of the classical algebra of area-preserving\ndiffeomorphisms on the plane as well as that of magnetic translations in a uniform field as discussed. Integer quantum\nHall states are invariant under area preserving diffeomorphisms. In finite size, the Girvin-Plazmann-MacDonald\nalgebra is the Lie algebra of U (N\u03a6 ). Combinations (powers and products) of the operators of the algebra commute\nwith the interacting Hamiltonian and can hence be simultaneously diagonalized giving the good quantum numbers\nof the problem. Our scope is to find the maximal set of such good quantum numbers for a translationally invariant\ninteracting electrons in the presence of a magnetic field.\n~1 =\nWe now particularize (without loss of generality, since one can always deform the BZ to a rectangle) to L\n~ 2 = Ly \u0177:\nLx x\u0302, L\ni\n\nT (Lx x\u0302)T (Ly \u0177)T (\u2212Lx x\u0302)T (\u2212Ly \u0177) = 1 = e l2 Lx Ly\n\n(10)\n\n~1 \u00d7 L\n~ 2 ) = 2\u03c0N\u03c6 .

N\u03c6 is the number of magnetic flux quanta passing through a unit cell. As a\nspoiler for the Chern insulator\n\u221a section, notice that this is the same as the number of sites Ns on a square lattice\nwith lattice constant a0 = 2\u03c0l2 and number of sites in the \u221a\nx direction Lx /a0\u221aand in the y direction Ly /a0 .

Observe that\nLx / 2\u03c0l2 \u2192 Nx , Ly / 2\u03c0l2 \u2192 Ny , N\u03c6 \u2192 Ns are all integers.\nMany-Body Translational Symmetries\n\nWe now focus on the interacting problem. The many-body problem is characterized by translation operators for\neach i'th particle, Ti (~a). Translational operators of different particles commute:\n1\n[Ti (~a), Tj (~b)] = \u22122\u03b4ij Ti (~a + ~b) sin( 2 \u1e91 * (~a \u00d7 ~b))\n2l\n\n(11)\n\nPhysical quantities are invariant under magnetic translations of any particle i by a linear combination of multiples of\nLx , Ly :\n~ mn = {mL\n~ 1 + nL\n~ 2,\nL\n\nm, n \u2208 Z}\n\n(12)\n\n~ mn are those for which \u03bbL\n~ mn , 0 < \u03bb < 1 are not lattice vectors - hence\nFollowing Haldane [19], primitive translations L\n(m, n) have no common divisors.

Since eigenstates are symmetric or\ni\nj\nantisymmetric under exchange of identical particles i, j, we have that ei\u03b8mn = ei\u03b8mn = ei\u03b8mn : the eigenvalues of the\ntranslation operators for particle i do not depend on the particle chosen. The Hilbert space of the problem is separated\nin different sectors labeled by \u03b81 , \u03b82 . At this point, the analysis of the symmetries of the problem under translational\ninvariance by each particle has run its course. Haldane [19] showed how to now introduce the many-body formalism\nfor the translation operators. We expand his description in detail below.\nConsider Ne electrons on a torus pierced by N\u03c6 fluxes, such that the filling factor \u03bd = Ne /N\u03c6 is a rational number\np/q, with (p, q) = 1 relatively prime. Let Ne = pN , N\u03c6 = qN where GCD(Ne , N\u03c6 ) = N . One thing we can hope from\na many-body formulation of the translation operators is to separate the many-body problem into its center of mass\npart and a relative coordinate part. The center of mass operator moves each and every particle by the same amount:\n\nTCM (~a) =\n\nNe\nY\n\nTi (~a)\n\n(16)\n\ni=1\n\nThe center of mass translation by an arbitrary quantity commutes with the Hamiltonian but does not commute with\n~ j ) and hence does not keep us in a Hilbert space specified by \u03b81 , \u03b82 . To\nthe single-particle translation operators Ti (L\nfind the center of mass operators act within the same Hilbert space, we look for all ~a for which the center of mass\n~ j ). Since operators of different particles commute, this is tantamount to\noperator TCM (~a) commutes with every Ti (L\nimposing the constraint:\n~ j )] = \u22122Ti (~a + L\n~ j ) sin(\n[Ti (~a), Ti (L\n\n1\n\u1e91 * (~a \u00d7 L~j )) = 0\n2l2\n\n(17)\n\n~ 1, L\n~ 2 span the 2-D plane, it is clear that\nHence the condition for vanishing commutator is \u1e91 * (~a \u00d7 L~j ) = 2l2 \u03c0r. Since L\n~ 1 + \u03b2L\n~ 2 where \u03b1, \u03b2 are real numbers. Taking j = 2 in Eq[17] we\nany vector in the plane can take the form ~a = \u03b1L\n2\n2\n~\n~\nhave: \u03b1\u1e91 * (L1 \u00d7 L2 ) = 2\u03c0l r = \u03b12\u03c0l N\u03c6 . Hence \u03b1 = r/N\u03c6 , and similarly - by taking j = 1, for \u03b2. Hence the most\n~ mn /N\u03c6 ). All other forms of center of mass\ngeneral center of mass motion which leaves the system invariant is TCM (L\ntranslation change the Hilbert space of the system.\nOur purpose now is to separate the motion of the system into a center of mass motion and a relative motion of\nthe particles. Towards this, Haldane [19] defined the relative translation operator T\u0303i acting on particle i so that the\nmotion of that particle is compensated by the motion of all other particles in the opposite direction:\n\nT\u0303i (~a) =\n\nNe\nY\nj=1\n\nTi (~a/Ne )Tj (\u2212~a/Ne ) = Ti ((Ne \u2212 1)~a/Ne )\n\nNe\nY\n\nTj (\u2212~a/Ne )\n\n(18)\n\nj=1, j6=i\n\nQNe\nSince Ti (~a)Ti (\u2212~a) = 1, the relative translation operator of the system has the property that i=1\nT\u0303i (~a) = 1.

Its eigenvalues are (\u22121)pq(Ne \u22121) exp(\u2212i~k * L\ni, j \u2208 [1 . . . N ]. Hence the BZ of the relative translation operators is made up of N \u00d7 N values of the momentum.

This\nexhausts our discussion of the relative translation operators.\nHaving fixed \u03b81 , \u03b82 , k, we now ask if there are any other degeneracies? The answer is yes. Physically, this is because\n\u03b81 , \u03b82 define the single-particle Hilbert space while k is the principal symmetry quantum number of the relative\nwavefunction |\u03c8rel i. Left untouched so far is the center of mass translational symmetry of the problem, or the center\n~ mn ) but there are missing center of mass\nof mass wavefunction |\u03c8CM i. In principle, we have diagonalized only the T\u0303i (pL\n~\n~\noperators, TCM (Lmn /Ns ) which also commute with the Ti (Lmn ) operators and keep us in the same Hilbert space; also,\nany center of mass translation operator commutes with the relative translation operator, and hence we are well on our\n~ mn /Ns )\nway towards finding other commuting operators. However, crucially, two center of mass translations TCM (L\n~\nand TCM (Lm0 n0 /Ns ) do not commute with each other and hence they cannot be simultaneously diagonalized. We\n~ mn /Ns ) that can be diagonalized, which, per the above is equal to the\nhence must find the maximum set of TCM (L\n~ mn /Ns ). We can find out how many TCM (L\n~ mn /Ns ) are self-commuting by either\nmaximally commuting set of TCM (L\nbrute-force calculation or by a smart argument. We start with the brute-force calculation of the commutator:\n[TCM (\n\nNe\nNe\n~ mn \u00d7L\n~ 0 0)\n\u1e91*(L\n~ mn + L\n~ m 0 n0\n~ m0 n0\n~ mn + L\n~ m 0 n0\n~ mn\nm n N Y\np\n0\n0 Y\nL\nL\nL\nL\n\u2212 i\ne\n2\nNs\nTi (\n), TCM (\n)] = e 2l2\n) = e\u2212i\u03c0 q (mn \u2212nm )\nTi (\n) (31)\nNs\nNs\nNs\nNs\ni=1\ni=1\n\nwhich vanishes iff (mn0 \u2212 nm0 )/q \u2208 Z.

If we require |\u03c8CM i to be an eigenstate of\nTCM (L0 /Ns ) where L0 is some particular primitive translation, the set of all center of mass translations that commute\n~ 0 /Ns ) is given by {TCM ((q L\n~ mn + rL\n~ 0 )/Ns )} with r = 0, 1, . . . q \u2212 1. Indeed, the commutator\nwith TCM (L\n~ mn + rL\n~ 0 )/Ns ), TCM ((q L\n~ m0 n0 + rL\n~ 0 )/Ns )] = 0\n[TCM ((q L\n\n(32)\n\nAs Haldane mentions [19], this is only one of the few resolutions of the center of mass degeneracy.

Due to the denominator\nN , the momentum is defined only mod N , which is an explicit way of seeing that the relative momentum BZ is\nmade out of N ky momenta. Note however, and this is essential, that this does not imply that all states with identical\nPNe\nPNe\ni=1 ji ( mod N ) belong to the same Hilbert space. In fact, only states with all\ni=1 ji ( mod N\u03c6 ) belong to the\nsame Hilbert space. The construction of relative translational symmetry-sorted Hilbert space proceeds as follows:\nFirst, write down all possible states |j1 , . . . , , jNe i with no constraint other than no double occupancy of orbitals\nin the case of fermions. NowP\nsort the Hilbert space into different sectors given by\nconstraint that each sector\nPNthe\nNe\ne\ncontains terms with identical i=1\nji ( mod N\u03c6 ). Not two states having different i=1\nji ( mod N\u03c6 ) can be coupled\nby\nSince N\u03a6 = qN , there will, in general, be more several sectors, with different\nPNaemomentum-conserving Hamiltonian. P\nNe\nj\n(\nmod\nN\n),\nwhich\nhave\nthe\nsame\ni\n\u03c6\ni=1\ni=1 ji ( mod N ). It is hence a mistake to first sort the Hilbert space first by\nPNe\nsectors with identical i=1 ji ( mod N ): this will result in a much larger number of free-many-body states per sector,\nPNe\nPNe\nbecause the states have yet to be sorted by i=1\nji ( mod N\u03a6 ).

This operation goes as follows: for every element of the set |j1 , . . . , jNe i form all the elements\n|j1 + qk, . . . , jNe + qki with k \u2208 Z. These elements form the orbit of T\u0303i (pLx x\u0302). Let the number of elements in an\norbit be Z. We can form eigenstates of the T\u0303i (pLx x\u0302) by taking combinations of the states in an orbit:\n|kx , ky i =\n\nZ\nX\nk=0\n\nei\n\n2\u03c0n\nN k\n\n|j1 + qk, . . . , jNe + qki\n\n(41)\n\nwhere n is an integer. The ky momentum of these states has been already established by the equation\nPNe\nji /N ) exp(i\u03c0pq(Ne \u2212 1)). To establish the kx momentum, we note that\nexp(\u2212iky Ly /N ) = exp(i2\u03c0 i=1\nT\u0303i (pLx x\u0302) |kx , ky i = ei\n\n2\u03c0n\nN\n\n|kx , ky i = (\u22121)pq(Ne \u22121) exp(\u2212ikx Lx /N ) |kx , ky i\n\n(42)\n\nand hence the exp(\u2212ikx Lx /N ) = exp(i2\u03c0n/N ) exp(i\u03c0pq(Ne \u2212 1)), where n \u2208 [0, . . . , N \u2212 1] is an integer. These\nare the basis states explicitly translationally invariant with the relative translation operator. They allow a large\nsimplification of numerical computation and explain the degeneracies observed in the spectrum of any translationally\ninvariant Hamiltonian. We will come back in more detail to the explicit construction of a translationally invariant\nHilbert space in the section .\nThe Density Algebra in the Lowest Landau Level\n\nThe results above can be put in an equivalent form when written in terms of the projected density algebra. In a\nsimilar way to how one defined the guiding center momentum K\u03b1 = \u03a0\u03b1 \u2212 l~2 (\u1e91 \u00d7 ~r)\u03b1 , a guiding center coordinate R\u03b1\n(one-body operator) can be defined:\nR\u03b1 = r\u03b1 \u2212\n\n2\n~ = l \u1e91 \u00d7 K\n~\nR\n~\n\nl2 ~\n(\u03a0 \u00d7 \u1e91)\u03b1 ,\n~\n\n(43)\n\nwhere r is the position of the particle. The guiding center coordinate is then related to the guiding center position\nand one can obtain the similar commutations: [\u03a0\u03b1 , R\u03b2 ] = 0, [R\u03b1 , R\u03b2 ] = il2 \u000f\u03b1\u03b2z . We can not build a guiding center\ndensity operator:\n~\n\n\u03c1(~q) = ei~q*R\n\n(44)\n\nIt is known that this operator has several interesting properties. First, it satisfies the GMP algebra:\ni 2\n\n\u03c1(~q)\u03c1(~q0 ) = \u03c1(~q + ~q0 )e\u2212 2 l\n\n(~\nq \u00d7~\nq 0 )*\u1e91\n\n,\n\n(45)\n\nwhich is not surprising as it is just a re-statement of the guiding center translation operator:\n~\n~ = \u03c1( \u1e91 \u00d7 L )\nT (L)\n2\nl\n\n(46)\n\nThe relation between the translation operators and densities means that all the many-body translation operators\nobtained in the previous section can be expressed in terms of the density operators. If we define the two fundamental\n~ 2 /A, ~q2 = \u22122\u03c0 L\n~ 1 /A, where A is the area of the BZ A = 2\u03c0l2 N\u03c6 , we obtain T (L\n~ mn ) =\nlattice momenta ~q1 = 2\u03c0 L\nN\u03c6\n(\u03c1(~qnm ))\nwith qmn = m~q1 + n~q2 , and [(\u03c1(~qnm ))N\u03c6 , H] = 0. From here on, one can just copy the many-body\nformulation of the translation\nQNe operators to obtain it in terms of the guiding center densities, and define a center of\nmass density \u03c1\u0304(~qnm ) = i=1\n\u03c1i (~qnm ) and a set of self-commuting relative density operators \u03c1\u0303i (pN\u03c6 ~qnm ) = \u03c1i ((Ne \u2212\nQNe\n1)pN\u03c6 ~qnm /Ne ) j6=i \u03c1j (\u2212pN\u03c6 ~qnm /Ne ) which can be simultaneously diagonalized to obtain the relative momentum\nquantum numbers, an identical copy of the situation encountered in the translation operator example.\n\n\f11\nIt is crucial to understand how the guiding center density relates to the usual density operator \u03c10 (~q) = exp(i~q * ~r).\nIt is easy to prove that, up to a factor, the guiding center density equals the projection of the usual density operator\ninto the lowest landau level:\nP ei~q*~r P = e\u2212\n\nq 2 l2\n4\n\n\u03c1(~q)\n\n(47)\n\nIn other words, the guiding center density is the projection of the usual density into the lowest band of the Landau\nlevel insulator. Let us re-capitulate the bidding. The many-body translational symmetries can be expressed in terms\nof a set of many-body density operators that obey a GMP algebra and who are the projection of the regular density\noperators in the lowest band of the insulator.\nCOUNTING OF ZERO MODES FOR THE READ-REZAYI AND OTHER MODEL STATES (AND\nQUASIHOLES) PER MOMENTUM SECTOR ON THE TORUS\n\nIn this section, we present a procedure which allows for the computation of the number of zero modes (groundstates\nand quasiholes) of many model FQH states resolved per each kx , ky momentum sector of the relative translational\noperators T\u0303i (pLx x\u0302), T\u0303i (pLy \u0177). We aim to obtain this counting without diagonalizing the Hamiltonians for which these\nmodel states are exact zero modes. We aim to give a combinatoric procedure for counting the states that is valid\nand can be performed for any number of particles. All states whose quasihole counting satisfied a generalized Pauli\nprinciple in orbital space are amenable to our construction. In a future section, we will use this counting and the one\nnumerically obtained from the FCI to check the emergent symmetry proposed in the FCI.\nWe work with a system of N\u03c6 orbitals. If that system was the sphere manifold, the problem of counting the zero\nmodes of certain pseudopotential Hamiltonians can be related to the problem of counting partitions satisfying certain\nconditions. The same conditions, subject to another periodicity constraint, are valid on the torus. We now state\nand justify these conditions, which have been obtained in previous studies [21\u201329]. Fermionic/bosonic many-body\nwavefunctions of Ne particles on any manifold can be expressed as linear combinations of Fock states in the occupation\nnumber basis of the single-particle orbitals. Each Fock state |\u03bbi can be labeled either by the list of occupied orbitals,\n\u03bb, or by the occupation number configuration, n(\u03bb). \u03bb = [\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbNe ] is an ordered partition of (the z angular\nPNe\nmomentum Ltot\nz on the sphere and) the one-dimensional momentum K =\ni=1 \u03bbi ( mod N\u03c6 ) on the torus into Ne\nparts and each orbital with index \u03bbj is occupied in the Fock state. We number the orbitals on the torus from 0\nto N\u03c6 \u2212 1, and hence each \u03bbi belongs to this interval. By definition, \u03bbi \u2265 \u03bbj if i < j, and re-ordering of the basis\nacquires the appropriate number of negative signs depending on whether the state is bosonic or fermionic. n(\u03bb) is\nthe occupation number configuration. It is defined as n(\u03bb) = {nj (\u03bb), j = 0, . . . N\u03c6 }, where nj (\u03bb) is the occupation\nnumber of the single-particle orbital with (angular) 1 \u2212 D momentum j.

In this section, we\nwill repeatedly use special kinds of partition - the so-called (k, r)-admissible partition. For bosons, a (k, r)-admissible\npartition labels a configuration whose occupation configuration has no more than k particles in r consecutive orbitals.\nFor fermions, a (k, r)-admissible partition labels a configuration whose occupation number has no more than k particles\nin k + r consecutive orbitals and not more than two particles in two consecutive orbitals. For example, [2, 2, 0, 0] is a\n(2, 2)-admissible bosonic partition on the torus of N\u03c6 = 4, while 2, 1, 0, 0 is not. On the torus, due to its periodicity (the\norbital of 1D momentum 0 is identified with the one of momentum N\u03c6 ) [2, 2, 0, 0] is not a (2, 2)-admissible partition\non the torus of N\u03c6 = 3, as depicted in Fig. 1.For obvious reasons, we call these admissibility rules generalized Pauli\nprinciples. Partitions satisfying Pauli generalized principles as the (k, r) one above, or other more complex ones play a\nprominent role in the physics of the FQH as it was proved that they count the Hilbert space of the quasiholes of many\nmodel FQH liquids. The number of (k, 2)-admissible partitions count the number of quasiholes of the Zk RR state,\nwhile the generic (k, r) case counts the number of Jack polynomials states. On the sphere, other concepts such as\nsqueezing, etc are important, but they are not on the torus and we will not discuss them further, referring the reader\nto the existing literature [30] On the sphere and on the torus, the bosonic RR sequence at filling \u03bd = k/2 here (see\nSec. for other model states), are the unique, highest density zero-mode wavefunctions of (k +1)-body pseudopotential\nHamiltonians[31]. Recent work[21] has shown the RR bosonic wavefunctions \u03c8 to be Jack polynomials J\u03bb\u03b10 indexed by\na parameter \u03b1 = \u2212(k + 1) and the densest-possible (k, 2)-admissible 'root' configuration[32] n(\u03bb0 ) = {k0k0k0 . . . k0k}.\nOn the torus, no extension of the Jack polynomials exist, but the correspondence between zero mode and partition\n\n\f12\n\na) [2,2,0,0] N F= 4\n\nb) [2,2,1,0] NF= 4\n\nc) [2,2,0,0] N = 3\nF\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic view of the partitions on the torus geometry. The shaded regions are the orbitals (4 for figures a and b, 3\nfor figure c). Among the three examples, only the situation a corresponds to a (2, 2)-admissible partition on the torus. On the\nsphere geometry both a and c would be (2, 2)-admissible partitions.\n\ncounting is still valid. One can imagine it does, as the admissible partitions implement a generalized Pauli exclusion\nstatistics, which should be independent of the manifold on which the state resides. On the torus, at filling k/2,\nN\u03c6 = 2Ne /k for the groundstate and bosonic (k, 2)-admissible partitions, we obtain the correct degeneracy (k + 1\nfor the Zk RR groundstates on the torus) by just counting the occupation number configurations with no more than\nk-particles in 2 consecutive orbitals [k 0 k 0.... k 0], [k \u2212 1 1 k \u2212 1 1.... k \u2212 1 1], [k \u2212 2 2 k \u2212 2 2.... k \u2212 2 2],\nand so on till [0 k 0 k.... 0 k]. Quasihole counting proceeds identically. Counting states through partitions in this\nway is usually referred to as the \"thin\"-torus limit, although we stress that this counting also applies for the sphere\n(where it can be analytically proved through the Jack-polynomial mapping), as well as for the finite size torus.\nThe counting of quasiholes for the Jack polynomial states proceeds as follows. First, in the 1D momentum on\nthe torus, write down all the (k, r) partitions (r = 2 gives the RR series) \u03bb = [\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbNe ] possible on the torus\n(remembering that the torus is periodic). Their number is the total number of the quasihole states for that flux.\nWe now aim to resolve the partitions by assuming they represent states and check their properties under the relative\ntranslation operators. It is trivial to first resolve ky . To obtain all the states (unresolved in kx ) at a certain ky we sort\nPNe\nPNe\nthe partitions based on the values of i=1\n\u03bbi ( mod N\u03c6 ). Partitions with the same i=1\n\u03bbi ( mod N\u03c6 ) belong to the\nPNe\nsame ky , whose value given by exp(\u2212iky Ly /N ) = exp(i2\u03c0 i=1 \u03bbi /N ) exp(i\u03c0pq(Ne \u2212 1)). Call such a set of partitions\n{\u03bbky }. We now must implement the translational symmetry in the x direction with momentum kx , which we do as in\nthe previous section. From all the partitions {\u03bbky } we again form the orbits by taking all partitions [\u03bb1 +qs, . . . , \u03bbNe +\nPZ\nqs], forming the orbit of number of elements Z and form the states s=0 exp(i2\u03c0ns/N )[\u03bb1 + qs, . . . , \u03bbNe + qs] with\nmomentum exp(\u2212ikx Lx /N ) = exp(i2\u03c0n/N ) exp(i\u03c0pq(Ne \u2212 1)). Several important things must be taken into account:\nin the elements of one orbit, [\u03bb1 + qs, . . . , \u03bbNe + qs], one needs to bring them to the same form of decreasing elements.\nNote that this is not trivial as \u03bbi + qs is defined mod N\u03c6 , and that it could involve sign changes for fermions. Also,\nfor some n's the linear combination of the orbit's partitions might not exist, as some states make up single orbits.\nWe will see this in the example below. For other orbits, the number of elements might be smaller than N , in which\ncase again not all kx momenta can be present. By building the states |kx , ky i one can clearly see which momenta are\nmissing. After momentum resolving, we can easily count the number of states in each kx , ky sector. Note that while\nthis procedure is constructive (we do not have a theoretical expression for the number of quasiholes per sector, but\nonly a way to construct them), it is an analytic map from a series of admissible partitions in 1D to a two-dimensional\nrelative momentum BZ.\nA complete understanding of how the counting of quasiholes per sector works comes from working out an example.\nWe will try to resolve the counting of quasihole states of a \u03bd = 1/3 Laughlin state of two electrons Ne = 2 on a torus of\nN\u03c6 = 12. The quasihole states are the zero-modes of the Laughlin quasiholes. Per our analysis above, the spectrum of\nany translationally invariant Hamiltonian has a (note Ne /N\u03c6 = 1/6 is the filling of the system; the degeneracy comes\nfrom it, but we are looking at the quasiholes of the \u03bd = 1/3 Laughlin state, and the counting will reflect that) six-fold\ndegeneracy. We will aim to show that the counting of zero-modes satisfies this center-of-mass degeneracy. Note that\nthe value of Ne /N\u03c6 fixes the degeneracy while the specified FQH state whose quasiholes we try to find \u03bd = 1/3 fixes\nthe Pauli principle responsible for the counting. To start, we write down all the (1, 3)-admissible partitions in N\u03c6 = 12\norbitals of Ne = 2 particles. There are 42 such configurations and they are given in Table[I]. Since Ne /N\u03c6 = 1/6, by\nour theory, the spectrum should be 6-fold center of mass degenerate. The non-degenerate states should be resolved\nby ky and kx relative translation momenta, which each take GCD(Ne , N\u03c6 ) = 2 values 0, 2\u03c0/Ly and 0, 2\u03c0/Lx . Per our\nPNe\nprocedure, we first sort the state into ones with values i=1\n\u03bbi ( mod N\u03c6 ). Table[II] presents the partitions sorted in\nsuch way (they canPobviously also be read from the 5'th column of Table[I]\nNotice that the P\u03bbi mod N = 0 sector (which is the equivalent of the ky = 0 sector, as (\u22121)pq(Ne \u22121) = 1 has 3\nelements while the \u03bbi mod N = 1 sector (the ky = 2\u03c0/Ly sector) has 4 elements. Notice how the counting of each\n\n\f13\n#\\\u03bb\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n3\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n10\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n11\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n[\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ]\n[3, 0]\n[4, 0]\n[5, 0]\n[6, 0]\n[7, 0]\n[8, 0]\n[9, 0]\n[4, 1]\n[5, 2]\n[6, 3]\n[7, 4]\n[8, 5]\n[9, 6]\n[10, 7]\n[11, 8]\n[5, 1]\n[6, 2]\n[7, 3]\n[8, 4]\n[9, 5]\n[10, 6]\n[11, 7]\n[6, 1]\n[7, 2]\n[8, 3]\n[9, 4]\n[10, 5]\n[11, 6]\n[7, 1]\n[8, 2]\n[9, 3]\n[10, 4]\n[11, 5]\n[8, 1]\n[9, 2]\n[10, 3]\n[11, 4]\n[9, 1]\n[10, 2]\n[11, 3]\n[10, 1]\n[11, 2]\n\nP\n\n\u03bbi\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n5\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n17\n19\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n17\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n9\n11\n13\n15\n10\n12\n14\n11\n13\n\nP\n\n\u03bbi mod N\u03c6\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n5\n7\n9\n11\n1\n3\n5\n7\n6\n8\n10\n0\n2\n4\n6\n7\n9\n11\n1\n3\n5\n8\n10\n0\n2\n4\n9\n11\n1\n3\n10\n0\n2\n11\n1\n\nP\n\n\u03bbi mod N\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\nTABLE I: Admissible (1, 3) configurations (not more than 1 particle in 3 consecutive orbitals) for Ne = 2 particles in N\u03c6 = 12\norbitals.

We now would\nlike to implement the x translational symmetry to find the counting of Laughlin quasiholes per momentum sector.\nThe same result will be obtained no matter which of the 6-fold degenerate sectors we pick.\nWe first look at ky = 0 sector with the states mapped by the partitions [8, 4], [9, 3], [10, 2]. To form the orbits\nwe must look at all elements [\u03bb1 + qs, \u03bb2 + qs] = [\u03bb1 + 6s, \u03bb2 + 6s]. The orbit of [8, 4] contains [14, 10] \u2261 [2, 10]\n(and obviously the orbit of [10, 2] contains [16, 8] \u2261 [4, 8]). Hence the two states [8, 4], [10, 2] can be used to build\nmomentum eigenstates:\n|n, ky = 0i = [8, 4] + ei\n\n2\u03c0n\nN\n\n[14, 10] = [8, 4] + ei\n\n2\u03c0n\nN\n\n[2, 10] = [8, 4] \u2212 ei\u03c0n [10, 2]\n\n(49)\n\nwhere we have used N = 2 and [2, 10] = \u2212[10, 2] because the particles are fermions. The action of the relative\ntranslation operator gives:\nT\u0303i (pLx x\u0302) |0, ky i = [14, 10] \u2212 [16, 8] = [2, 10] \u2212 [4, 8] = |0, ky i\n\n(50)\n\nand hence this state has momentum kx = 0. Similarly, the state |1, ky i has momentum kx = 2\u03c0/Lx . Out of the\noriginal 3 states at momentum ky = 0, we now have to analyze [9, 3]. As it is a single state, it forms an orbit by itself.\nThis is indeed true, as [9 + 6, 3 + 6] = [15, 9] \u2261 [3, 9] = \u2212[9, 3]. Due to the fermionic sign, this is state at momentum\nkx = 2\u03c0/Lx . We have now determined that we have 1 zero mode state at momentum kx , ky = 0, 0 and 2 at momentum\nkx , ky = 2\u03c0/Lx , 2\u03c0/Ly . Note that of course, our choice of which states to pick for the ky = 0 momentum is irrelevant,\ngiving the same counting. If instead we had picked the set of ky = 0 states [9, 5], [10, 4], [11, 3], then [9, 5]\u2212[11, 3] would\nbe the state at kx = 0, while [9, 5] + [11, 3] and [10, 4] would be the state at momentum kx = 2\u03c0/Lx . This completes\nthe symmetry analysis of the zero modes of 2 particles in N\u03c6 = 12 of the Haldane pseudopotential Hamiltonian for\nthe Laughlin state at ky = 0.\nWe now look at ky = 2\u03c0/L sector with the states denoted by the partitions [8, 5], [9, 4], [10, 3], [11, 2]. The orbit of\n[8, 5] is [2, 11] \u2261 \u2212[11, 2], while the orbit of [9, 4] is [3, 10] \u2261 \u2212[10, 3]. Hence the state [8, 5] \u2212 [11, 2] has momentum\nkx = 0 while [8, 5] + [11, 2] has kx = 2\u03c0/Lx . Identically, [9, 4] \u2212 [10, 3] and[9, 4] + [10, 3] have momenta kx = 0, \u03c0/Lx .\nHence there are 2 states for kx = 0 and 2 states for kx = 2\u03c0/Lx . The same counting would be obtained if we\npicked any of the other states at ky = 2\u03c0/Ly . We have now given a combinatoric prescription for counting the\nstates per momentum sector of the relative translation operators. For 2-particles in 12 orbitals the quasiholes of the\nLaughlin state have the following quantum numbers: 2 states in each of the kx , ky equal to 0, 2\u03c0/Ly , 2\u03c0/Lx , 0, and\n2\u03c0/Lx , 2\u03c0/Ly momenta, and 1 state in the 0, 0 momentum. There is 6-fold center of mass degeneracy which multiplies\nthese 7 states to obtain the total of 42 quasihole states.\nAs a last simple example, let us look at resolving the quantum numbers of the bosonic groundstates of the Haldane\npseudopotential for the MR interaction for Ne = 4 particles in N\u03c6 = 4 fluxes. As Ne /N\u03c6 = 1 there is no center of mass\ndegeneracy and the BZ of the relative translation operators is a 4\u00d74 momenta. We first write down all the (k, r) = (2, 2)\npartitions (whose counting corresponds to the bosonic MR state) of 4 particles in 4 orbitals. They are, in occupation\nnumber 2020, 0202, 1111, totaling 3, the correct non-Abelian degeneracy of the MR state,\nP4 and they correspond to the\npartitions \u03bb = [2, 2, 0, 0], [3, 3, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1, 0] respectively. We first sort the states by i=1 \u03bbi ( mod 4), which gives\n\n\f15\nP4\n0, 0, 2. The i=1 \u03bbi ( mod 4) = 2 state is [3, 2, 1, 0] has e\u2212iky Ly /4 = ei2\u03c0*2/4 * (\u22121), the \u2212 sign coming from pq(Ne \u2212 1)\nbeing odd. Hence ky = 0. We now find its kx : T\u0303i (pLx x\u0302)[3, 2, 1, 0] = [4, 3, 2, 1] \u2261 [0, 3, 2, 1] \u2261 [3, 2, 1, 0] by virtue of the\nbosonic nature of the state. Hence e\u2212ikx Lx /N = \u22121 or kx = 4\u03c0/Lx . There is 1 state at kx , ky = 4\u03c0/Lx , 0. The two\nother states [2, 2, 0, 0], [3, 3, 1, 1] belong to the ky = 4\u03c0/Ly sector and to the same orbit. We hence form the states:\n|0, ky i = [2, 2, 0, 0] + [3, 3, 1, 1],\n\n|2, ky i = [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2212 [3, 3, 1, 1],\n\n\u03c0\n\n|1, ky i = [2, 2, 0, 0] + ei 2 [3, 3, 1, 1] = [2, 2, 0, 0] + i[3, 3, 1, 1]\n\n|3, ky i = [2, 2, 0, 0] + ei\n\n3\u03c0\n2\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1] = [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2212 i[3, 3, 1, 1]\n\n(51)\n\nIt is clear that two states [2, 2, 0, 0], [3, 3, 1, 1] cannot be made into the 4 independent momentum states above. Indeed,\nthis is because |1, ky i , |3, ky i are not momentum eigenstates; for example T\u0303i (pLx x\u0302) |1, ky i = i |3, ky i. The only two\nmomentum eigenstates are |0, ky i at momentum kx = 4\u03c0/Lx and |2, ky i, at momentum kx = 2\u03c0(4 mod N )/Lx = 0.\nWe now found that our combinatoric counting principle predicts that the zero modes of the Haldane pseudopotential\nfor which the MR wavefunction is the groundstate are resolved by the relative translation operators into momenta\nkx , ky equal to (4\u03c0/Lx , 0), (0, 4\u03c0/Ly ) and 4\u03c0/lx , 4\u03c0/Ly ). An exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian confirms this.\nIt is immediately obvious that the current example can be easily generalized to all the (k, r) states. Our procedure\nallows for a combinatoric approach to resolving the number of quasiholes per momentum sector just by counting\npartitions. It goes beyond the usual counting on the 1D-torus momentum which can only give the total number of\nquasiholes per 1 D momentum. More examples and data for Abelian and non-Abelian states will be presented in the\nsection which uncovers the mapping of FQH to FCI.\nEMERGENT MANY-BODY SYMMETRIES IN THE FRACTIONAL CHERN INSULATOR\n\nIn this section we show the appearance of many-body translational symmetry operators in the FCI. We first rederive the result, obtained in [15] and rederived in [33], that the long-wavelength algebra of the projected density\noperators in a Chern insulator has a GMP form when the Berry curvature variation is not large. We show that the\nnon-commutativity of the projected density matrices is required by the nonzero Chern number in the nontrivial Chern\ninsulator. We then show that the problem of a Hamiltonian with such a projected density algebra can be mapped into\na FQH problem of a translationally invariant Hamiltonian superimposed on a background lattice of Nx \u00d7 Ny (= N\u03c6 )\nsites. We then show that this problem admits relative translational operators and momenta which are a folding of\nthe ones obtained in the FQH case in the continuum.\nOne-body projected density algebra of an insulator\n\nIn this subsection, we re-derive the result obtained in [15]. We work with translationally invariant one-body\nHamiltonians:\nX \u2020\nH=\nci\u03b1 hi\u2212j;\u03b1,\u03b2 cj\u03b2\n(52)\ni,j,\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 contain orbital and spin indices. We call \u03b1\norbital index. We now quickly introduce some conventions.\nPan \u2212ikj\ne\ncj\u03b1 where by kj we mean ~k * ~j and Ns is the number of\nOur Fourier transform sign convention is ck\u03b1 = \u221a1N\nj\ns\nP \u2212ikr\nsites on a lattice with aspect ratio Nx \u00d7Ny . The Bloch Hamiltonian matrix is: h\u03b1\u03b2 (k) = \u221a1N\nhr;\u03b1,\u03b2 The Bloch\nre\ns\nP\nn\nHamiltonian can be separated into normal mode operators \u03b3k at momentum k of the band n H = Pk,n En (k)\u03b3kn\u2020 \u03b3kn\nwhere the normal modes can be written as a matrix rotation of the original electron operators\n\u03b3kn = \u03b2 un?\nk,\u03b2 ck,\u03b2 . The\nP\nn?\nelements of the matrix are uk,\u03b2 which form the eigenstates of the Bloch Hamiltonian \u03b2 h\u03b1\u03b2 (k)unk,\u03b2 = En (k)unk,\u03b1 .\nWe then define the projector into the band n at momentum k by\nPnk = \u03b3kn\u2020 |0i h0|\u03b3kn\n\n(53)\n\nFractional topological insulators are usually constructed and observed in models with fractionally filled bands whose\nbandwidth is very small, such that interactions and not the kinetic energy dominate the physics. The ideal example\nof such an insulator is the flat band one-body deformation of any Hamiltonian insulator h(k):\nX\nX\nHF B = \u2212\nPn1 ,k +\nPn2 ,k\n(54)\nn1 ,En1 ,k <\u03bc\n\nn2 ,En2 ,k >\u03bc\n\n\f16\nFrom now on, we will consider the physics of the (fractionally) occupied bands and look only at projectors into the\n\u2020\noccupied bands. We define the density operator per orbital \u03b1 at site j, \u03c1\u03b1\nj = cj\u03b1 cj\u03b1 whose Fourrier transform reads:\nP\nP\n\u2020\n\u2212iqj \u03b1\n\u221a1\n\u03c1j = \u221a1N\n\u03c1\u03b1\nq =\nje\nk c\u03b1,k c\u03b1,k+q . Notice that we do not shift the sum to put k +q/2, k \u2212q/2 because, while\nNs\ns\nperfectly suitable in the continuum, that would change the boundary conditions on a lattice at which qi is quantized\nin units of 2\u03c0/Ni (i = x, y)\nAs we are interested in the low-energy physics in the fractionally filled bands, we define the projected density\n,\u03b1,n2\nn1 ,\u03b1,n2\n\u221a1 un1 ? un2\n\u03b4\n\u03b3 n1 \u2020 |0i h0|\u03b3kn12+q\noperator \u03c1\u0303kn11,q,k\n= Pn1 ,k1 \u03c1\u03b1\nq Pn2 ,k2 which has the following form: \u03c1\u0303k1 ,q,k2 =\n2\nNs \u03b1,k1 \u03b1,k1 +q k2 ,k1 +q k1\nP\nThe full projected density involves a summation over the orbital \u03b1, and over the projection operators P = k,n Pn,k :\n1\n\u03c1\u0303q = \u221a\nNs\n\nX\nn1 ,n2 ,\u03b1,k\n\nn2\n1 ? n2\nun\u03b1,k\nu\u03b1,k+q \u03b3kn1 \u2020 |0i h0|\u03b3k+q\n\n(55)\n\nTaking of two densities at momenta q and w, we obtain:\n\n[\u03c1q , \u03c1w ] =\n\n1\nNs\n\nX\nk,n1 ,n2 ,m2 ,\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nn1 \u2020\nm2\n1 ? n2\n2?\n2\n1?\n(un\u03b1,k\nun2 un2 ? um2\n\u2212 un\u03b2,k\nu\u03b2,k+w un\u03b1,k+w\num\n|0i h0|\u03b3k+q+w\n\u03b1,k+w+q )\u03b3k\n1 \u03b1,k+q \u03b2,k+q \u03b2,k+w+q\n\n(56)\n\nWe particularize to the low-wavelength continuum limit q << 1 (in lattice constant units).

First, the commutator\nof two densities has to be non-zero in a nontrivial Chern insulator. That is so because the Chern number of the\ninsulator can be expressed as a trace over the density commutator, as shown in Appendix 2. Second, the commutator\nof densities at the smallest available lattice momentum 2\u03c0/(Nx a), 2\u03c0/(Ny a) with a the lattice constant is identical\nto the commutator of the projected X and Y lattice position operators, as shown in Appendix 3. The trace of this\ncommutator is known to give the Chern number. Third, as a bonus, the expression of the Chern number in terms of\nthe commutator of the projected X, Y coordinates allows for a direct derivation of the Chern number of the continuum\nLandau level, which was not possible with the usual TKNN formula for the Chern number which involve derivatives\nover the two momenta. We show this in Appendix 4\n\n\f17\nGirvin-MacDonald-Platzman Algebra for Insulators with Smooth Berry Curvature\n\nWe now particularize to two-band models (insulators with one band below and above the gap) or to many-band\ninsulators where the non-Abelian components of the field strength can be neglected. We observe that the commutator\nin Eq[60] does not form an algebra as the right-hand side is not easily expressible in terms of a density operator.\nHowever, the commutator algebra has an eerie similarity to a GMP algebra at long wavelength. As pointed out in\n[15], if the local Berry curvature can be replaced by its average:\nR\nd2 kBm (k)\n2\u03c0C\n\u1e91\n(61)\n=\nFij (k) = \u000fijm Bm (k) = \u000fij BZR\n2\n2k\n(2\u03c0/a)\nd\nBZ\nwhere C is the band Chern number. We then observe that the field strength can be taken out of the sum in Eq[60],\nP\nm\nand, since to zeroth order in q + w, \u03c1q+w = k \u03b3kn\u2020 |0i h0|\u03b3k+q+w\n+ O(q + w). The commutator algebra then becomes:\n[\u03c1q , \u03c1w ] = \u2212i(~q \u00d7 w)\n~ * \u1e91\n\n2\u03c0C\n\u03c1q+w\n(2\u03c0/a)2\n\n(62)\n\nwhich is identical to the GMP algebra at small q. Several comments are now necessary: first, in a two-band insulator,\nit is impossible to have a constant Berry curvature due to the no-hair theorem[34], although this seems possible in\ninsulators with four or more bands [34]. However, we will from now on assume that this is indeed possible, and assume\nthe validity, at low-energies of the GMP algebra for Chern insulators. We then observe that the density algebra for\nthe Chern insulator is identical for low momenta to the one for the Landau level QH problem if:\n(~q \u00d7 w)\n~ * \u1e91\n\n2\u03c0\n= (~q1 \u00d7 ~q2 ) * \u1e91l2\n(2\u03c0/a)2\n\n(63)\n\nwhere q, w are the smallest values of the momentum on the lattice: ~q = 2\u03c0/(Nx a)x\u0302, w\n~ = 2\u03c0/(Ny a)\u0177 while ~q1 =\n~ 2 /A, ~q2 = \u22122\u03c0 L\n~ 1 /A are the smallest momenta of the QH torus. A = (L\n~1 \u00d7 L\n~ 2 ) * \u1e91 = 2\u03c0l2 N\u03c6 is the area of\n2\u03c0 L\nthe continuum torus BZ, (2\u03c0/a)2 is the area of the BZ on the lattice, and we specialized, without loss of generality\nto a square lattice. Since the LLL has Chern number 1 (see Appendix 4), we also took C = 1. We hence have\n2\u03c0C\n(~q1 \u00d7 ~q2 ) * \u1e91l2 = (2\u03c0)2 l2 /A = 2\u03c0/N\u03c6 = (~q \u00d7 w)\n~ * \u1e91 (2\u03c0/a)\n2 = 2\u03c0/(Nx Ny ) which leads us to the equivalence of the\nGMP algebras for a Chern insulator with Chern number 1 on a lattice with Nx , Ny sites in the x, y directions and the\nalgebra of the QH effect on a torus pierced by N\u03c6 flux quanta if :\nN\u03c6 = Nx * Ny\n\n(64)\n\nAn important remark should be made here. As pointed out in [15], it is important to realize that there is no oneto-one mapping between the Chern insulator density algebra and the FQH one. First, the FCI density GMP algebra\nis valid only at long-wavelengths, and it will be our assumption that as system sizes reach thermodynamic limit,\nits application transcends the long-wavelength limit and it becomes an approximate symmetry of the system at all\nwavelengths. This is indeed justified posteriori by our extensive numerical checks, which prove the existence of center\nof mass degeneracies in the Chern insulator which would be possible only if the many-body translational operators\nobeyed GMP algebra for all wavelengths. Second, the number of density generators in the FCI and FQH differ (Ns in\nthe FCI, Ns2 in the FQH) [15], but, as was pointed out in [15], there are many instances when the significant physics\nis governed only by the Ns operators in the FCI.\nFractional Quantum Hall to Fractional Chern Insulator Mapping\n\nWe now found that the constant Berry curvature Chern insulator density algebra is identical to that of electrons\nin a uniform magnetic field with number of fluxes N\u03c6 = Nx * Ny . Hence the translational symmetries of the two\nproblems should share similarities. To complete the analogy, since the Chern insulator is defined on a lattice, and\nhence we need to introduce a lattice to the FQH problem. We are then led to consider the translational symmetries\nof the Hamiltonian in magnetic field:\n\nH=\n\nNy\nNe\nNe X\nNx X\nX\nX\n1 X\n1 X\n\u03a02j +\nei~q*(~ri \u2212~rj ) + V0\n\u03b4(~ri \u2212 mlx x\u0302 \u2212 nly \u0177)\nV (~q)\n2m j\n2A\ni<j\ni=1 m=1 n=1\nq\n~\n\n(65)\n\n\f18\nwith \u03a0j = \u2212i~\u2207j \u2212 eA(rj ) = \u2212i~\u2207j + |e|A(rj ) the canonical momentum in the presence of a magnetic field. Ne is the\n~ \u00d7A\n~ = B.\n~ The positions of the particles,\nnumber of electrons in the system. We choose not to gauge-fix, and have \u2207\n~ 1, L\n~ 2 . The Hamiltonian is periodic under translations by these\n{~ri }, reside on a two-dimensional torus of generators L\n~ 1,2 ) and can be written as a sum over the allowed reciprocal vectors ~q. A = |L\n~1 \u00d7L\n~ 2|\nvectors, V (~ri \u2212 ~rj ) = (~ri \u2212 ~rj + L\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0 ~\n~\nis the area of the sample, and ~q = m~q1 + n~q2 , m, n \u2208 Z and ~q1 = A L2 \u00d7 \u1e91, ~q2 = \u2212 A \u1e91 \u00d7 L1 . We choose to work on a\nsquare lattice, without any loss of generality. If the Hamiltonian of Eq[65] was made out of only the first two terms,\nthe symmetry analysis would have been identical to the one presented in Section 2 and the number of states of any\nmodel FQH state per momentum sector would have been obtainable by our constructive procedure of implementing\nthe relative translational symmetries in both x, y directions on the (k, r)-generalized Pauli principle states.\nThe last term of Eq[65] implements the lattice with Nx sites in the x direction and Ny sites in the y. The lattice\nconstants in the x, y directions are lx = L1 /Nx , ly = L2 /Ny . It makes electrons energetically favorable (for large\nnegative V0 ) to sit on lattice sites, and it makes the momenta in the x, y direction take the discretized set of values\n(~q * x\u0302, ~q * \u0177) = (2\u03c0i/(Nx lx ), 2\u03c0j/(Ny ly )) with i = 0, . . . , Nx , j = 0, . . . , Ny , which also serve as the momenta of the\nmany-body states. The problem defined by Eq[65] is similar to that of the Chern insulator: it has the same density\nalgebra in the long wavelength limit, the same lattice and the same translationally invariant Hamiltonian. The twobody Hamiltonian can be replaced by an n-body Hamiltonian, as long as it is translationally invariant. A physical\nassumption is then the fact that the low-energy spectrum of the FQH and FCI problems (when the FCI problem has\na topologically ordered groundstate) will be similar. More to the point, we take it as a proof of the topological nature\nof the FCI state that the low-energy manifold of states has the identical counting, per momentum sector to that of\nthe FQH states at the same filling in the presence of the lattice in Eq[65]. We now find what that counting is.\nThe presence of the lattice influences the symmetries of the problem. The set of continuum translation operators\nTi (~a) are not valid unless ~a is a multiple of the lattice constants lx x\u0302, ly \u0177. Hence translational symmetry operators\nare Ti (mx lx x\u0302), Ti (my ly \u0177). Although the one-body terms of the Eq[65] commute with Ti (lx x\u0302), Ti (ly \u0177), due to the\nmany-body interacting term (which does not commute with those operators), the Hamiltonian still commutes only\nwith Ti (Nx lx x\u0302), Ti (Ny ly \u0177). The Hilbert space is described by the two twist parameters:\nTi (Nx lx x\u0302) |\u03c8i = ei\u03b8x |\u03c8i ,\n\nTi (Ny ly \u0177) |\u03c8i = ei\u03b8y |\u03c8i\n\n(66)\n\nAs the number of fluxes per unit cell plaquette is N\u03c6 /(Nx Ny ) = 1, the translational operators of unit cell length commute: [Ti (lx x\u0302), Tj (ly \u0177)] = \u22122\u03b4ij Ti (lx x\u0302 + ly \u0177) sin(lx ly /2l2 ) = 0 since lx ly /2l2 = Lx Ly /2l2 Nx Ny = 2\u03c0l2 N\u03c6 /2l2 Nx Ny =\nQNe\n\u03c0. The center of mass translation operator T (~a) = i=1\nTi (~a) commutes with the translation operator Ti (lx x\u0302) or\n~\n~ 2 /N\u03c6 )), which commuted with Ti (L\n~ 2 ), (or Ti (L\n~ 1)\nTi (ly \u0177) if ~a = lx x\u0302 or ly \u0177. Notice that the operator T (L1 /N\u03c6 ) (or T (L\nrespectively) in the continuum limit, does not appear here because L1 /N\u03c6 = L1 /(Nx Ny ) = lx /Ny is smaller than\nthe permissible lattice constant. Hence the center of mass translation operators commute between themselves and\ntheexact q-fold degeneracy apparent in the continuum FQH is reduced to a one-fold degeneracy of any sector (in other\nwords, we will not have exact degeneracies anymore). However, if by adding the lattice we still remain in the FQH\nstate, then remnants of the original degeneracies and spectrum in the continuum should appear even after adding\nthe lattice. In particular, we know the counting of the degenerate zero-mode quasihole states (for FQH series such\nas RR) in the continuum, where they are zero-modes of pseudopotential Hamiltonians. We now try to find what the\ncounting on the lattice momentum.\nAs we know the counting of the FQH per continuum momentum of the relative translational operators, we now\ntry to implement the relative translational\nQN symmetries of the problem. The relative translation operators in the\ncontinuum, T\u0303i (~a) = Ti ((Ne \u2212 1)~a/Ne ) j6=ei Ti (\u2212~a/Ne ), make sense only if a/Ne is a multiple of lx or ly , and hence\nthe relative translation operators by the smallest amount are:\nY\nT\u0303i (Ne lx x\u0302) = Ti ((Ne \u2212 1)lx x\u0302)\nTj (\u2212lx x\u0302)\n(67)\nj6=i\n\n~ 1 ), Ti (L\n~ 2 ) and do they\nand similarly for ly . We now ask two questions : do these operators commute with Ti (L\ncommute with the Hamiltonian of the problem? The answer to the first question is an unequivocal yes, as L1 ly /2l2 =\nLx Ly /2l2 Ny = \u03c0N\u03c6 /Ny = \u03c0Nx ). The answer to the last question is no, because T\u0303i (Ne lx x\u0302) commutes with exp(i~q*(~rj \u2212\n~rl )) when j, l 6= i as it translates both coordinates by the same amount but does not commute with exp(i~q * (~ri \u2212 ~rl ))\nT\u0303i (Ne lx x\u0302)ei~q(~ri \u2212~rl ) = ei~q(~ri +(Ne \u22121)lx x\u0302) e\u2212i~q*(~rl \u2212lx x\u0302) ei~q(~ri \u2212~rl ) T\u0303i (Ne lx x\u0302) = ei~q*x\u0302Ne lx ei~q(~ri \u2212~rl ) T\u0303i (Ne lx x\u0302)\n\n(68)\n\nsince ~q * x\u0302 = 2\u03c0j/Nx lx , j = 0, 1, . . . Nx , and hence Ne lx = 2\u03c0Ne /Nx ; an identical situation obviously occurs for\n\n\f19\nT\u0303i (Ne ly \u0177). As Ne , Nx , Ny are integers, we now define several important ratios and common denominators:\nGCD(Ne , Nx ) = N0x ,\n\nGCD(Ne , Ny ) = N0y ,\n\npx\nNe\n=\n,\nNx\nqx\n\nNe\npy\n=\nNy\nqy\n\n(69)\n\nThe qx , qy are integers and should not be mistaken for the components of a q momentum vector. Fortunately, this mistake is hard to do from the context. There are obvious relations between the above and N = GCD(Ne , N\u03c6 ), Ne /N\u03c6 =\np/q, but we will come to this later. It is then clear to see which relative translation operators commute with the\nHamiltonian:\nY\nY\nT\u0303i (qx Ne lx x\u0302) = Ti (qx (Ne \u2212 1)lx x\u0302)\nTj (\u2212qx lx x\u0302), T\u0303i (qy Ne ly \u0177) = Ti (qy (Ne \u2212 1)ly \u0177)\nTj (\u2212qy ly \u0177)\n(70)\nj6=i\n\nj6=i\n\nThese operators commute with both translations and the Hamiltonian. They also commute between themselves and\nhence can be diagonalized (remember that in the Chern insulator, the commutations are only approximate, lowenergy properties, as the GMP algebra is valid only at long wavelength). We now ask how many eigenvalues of these\noperators are independent. We use thePsame reasoning as in the continuum limit and assume that the many-body\nNe\n~ *~ri ), an increase in its momentum by Q\n~ as long as Q\n~ is an allowed\nexp(iQ\nstate experiences, when acted upon by i=1\nlattice momentum exp(iQx L1 ) = exp(Qy L2 ) = 1. The eigenvalues \u03bbk\nT\u0303i (qx Ne lx x\u0302 + qy Ne ly \u0177) |\u03c8(k)i = \u03bb(k) |\u03c8(k)i\n\n(71)\n\ncan be easily obtained by following the continuum proof closely and satisfy \u03bb(k) = D exp(\u2212i(ky qy ly \u2212 kx qx lx )).\nThe coefficient D can be determined by requiring that the k = 0 state has maximum lattice symmetry, and hence\nD |\u03c8(k = 0)i = T\u0303i (qy Ne ly \u0177) |\u03c8(k = 0)i = T\u0303i (\u2212qx Ne lx x\u0302) |\u03c8(k = 0)i = T\u0303i (qy Ne ly \u0177 \u2212 qx Ne lx x\u0302) |\u03c8(k = 0)i. From here\nwe obtain that D = (\u22121)qx qy Ne (Ne \u22121) = 1 (notice the difference from the continuum case, in which D could be both\n1, \u22121). To obtain the values of different relative momenta, we notice that:\n(T\u0303i (qx Ne lx x\u0302))N0x = (T\u0303i (qy Ne ly \u0177))N0y = 1\n\n(72)\n\nwhich implies exp(\u2212ikx qx N0x lx ) = exp(\u2212iky qy N0y ly ) = 1. Expectedly, kx = 2\u03c0j/Nx lx and ky = 2\u03c0j/Ny ly with\nj = 1, 2..... Now that we obtained the values of the different momenta, we can ask how many of these eigenvalues\nare distinct. The eigenvalues appear as exp(ikx qx lx ) = exp(i2\u03c0jqx /Nx ) = exp(i2\u03c0j/N0x ) and similarly for the y\ncomponent, so the number of distinct momenta resolving the relative translation symmetry is:\nkx =\n\n2\u03c0j\n, j = 0, . . . , N0x \u2212 1;\nNx lx\n\nky =\n\n2\u03c0j\n, l = 0, . . . , N0y \u2212 1\nNy ly\n\n(73)\n\n, j =\nThis defines a N0x \u00d7 N0y BZ.

To show this, we first note that both N0x , N0y divide N . Indeed, since GCD(Nx , Ne ) =\nN0x , GCD(Ny , Ne ) = N0y , and (Ns , Ne ) = (Nx Ny , Ne ) = N , we have that GCD(Nx Ny /N0x , Ne /N0x ) = N/N0x =\nGCD(qx Ny , px N0x ), which proves that N/N0x is an integer and similarly for N/N0y . With Ne /Ns = p/q, we have\nNe = pN = px N0x and hence N = px N0x /p = py N0y /p we have that the FCI momentum quantum numbers kx , ky\nof the relative translation operator are a px /p, py /p folding of the FQH momentum quantum numbers in the x, y\ndirections respectively. We have hence taken care of the relative momentum quantum numbers.\nIn the FQH in the continuum there is a center of mass degeneracy of q. This center of mass degeneracy comes from\n~ mn /Ns ). On the lattice, we also\nthe non-commutativity of the continuum center of mass translation operators TCM (L\nknow that since:\nT\u0303i (qx Ne lx x\u0302) * TCM (qx lx x\u0302) = Ti (qx Ne lx x\u0302)\n\n(74)\n\nthe eigenvalue of TCM (qx lx x\u0302) is fixed once kx and \u03b8x are known (similarly for TCM (qy ly \u0177)).

The total number of states of the low-energy manifold the dotted line\nis 42. Per momentum sector, the counting is 3 states if ky is divisible by 2 and 4 states otherwise, irrespective of kx (there\nare degeneracies in the spectrum, for example, there are 5 states at momentum (0, 0), the low-energy manifold being 3-fold\ndegenerate with zero energy\n\nthe x direction and qy quasi-degeneracy in the ky direction. This degeneracy, as well as the relative momentum, make\nup the full BZ of the Nx \u00d7 Ny lattice. Note that in the lattice example, all translation operators commute with each\nother (courtesy of unit flux per unit cell), so in effect we could just diagonalize those. However, we choose to build\nthe relative translational operators because in the continuum case we already know the counting per the momentum\nquantum number attached with these operators in the FQH. To obtain the counting of the eigenstates per FCI relative\nmomentum, one needs to fold the FQH relative momentum BZ. This folding now needs to be supplemented by the\nmiss-match in the center of mass degeneracy. In the FQH, the center of mass degeneracy is q; in the FCI, it is qx qy .\nIn Appendix 5 we show that q/(qx qy ) is an integer number. The counting of states in the low manifold, sorted, per\nFCI relative momentum sector is a folding of the FQH relative momentum BZ times the mismatch in center of mass\ndegeneracy q/(qx qy ).\nIn conclusion, the diagonalization of a Chern insulator at fractional rational filling should exhibit, in the topologically\nordered phase, a low-energy manifold of states with counting which encodes the topological character of the state. The\nlow-energy manifold of states is a result of the emergent translational symmetry of the system that the long wavelength\nGMP algebra implies. For a Nx \u00d7 Ny lattice with Ne electrons, the states in this low manifold will experience an\nemergent center of mass degeneracy, with the spectrum being qx \u00d7 qy quasi-degenerate (in the kx , ky direction). If\nthe state developing in the system is at filling p/q, the low-energy manifold will contain either the groundstates or\nthe quasihole excitations of this state. Once the center of mass degeneracy is resolved, the spectrum of the FCI per\nrelative momentum sector is a folding of the spectrum of the FQH relative momentum BZ. We present clear examples\nof this procedure in the next subsection for the FCI at 1/3- Abelian topological order before presenting numerical\ndata on the Abelian and non-Abelian FCI states.\nTwo Simple Examples of the FQH to FCI Mapping\n\nWe now look at two simple examples of how the analytical construction in the previous sections can be applied to\nthe numerical data in both the energy and the entanglement spectrum. The counting per momentum sector can be\nobtained from our FQH to FCI mapping. Lets first look at the specific case of such counting for Nx \u00d7 Ny = 3 \u00d7 4\nlattice Chern insulator model of [20] diagonalized in the flat-band limit [8] with Ne = 2 electrons and nearest neighbor\n(on-site being forbidden) Hubbard interaction. This interaction favors a 1/3 Abelian state, which we know occurs\nin the FQH state for short-range repulsive pseudopotentials. As the state contains only 2-particles, we expect that\n\n\f21\nthe physics is that of 2-electron \u03bd = 1/3 Abelian FQH state plus a number of 6 quasiholes. The physics also reveals\nthe structure of the pseudopotential two-body interaction in the FCI. The spectrum, shown in Fig[2], confirms this.\nWe observe a clear gap between a low-energy manifold of states and a high-energy manifold of spurious states. We\nfocus on the low-energy manifold. By looking at the numerical data (Fig[3], which includes degeneracies), we see\nthat the low-energy manifold exhibits a counting of states of either 3 or 4 states per momentum sector, depending\non whether ky is divisible or not by 2, as can be seen in Fig[3]. This clearly shows that the spectrum is 6-fold\ndegenerate, and more-over, that this degeneracy splits in a kx - 3-fold degenerate and a ky - 2-fold degeneracy. This\nis consistent to our analysis, for Ne /Nx = 2/3, Ne /Ny = 1/2 which fix qx = 3, qy = 2. Since the GCD(Nx , Ne ) = 1,\nwhile the GCD(Ny , Ne ) = 1, the relative momentum BZ is made of kx = 0 and ky = 0, 2\u03c0/(Ny a) where a is the\nlattice constant in the y direction. In this BZ, the counting of states is 3, 4 respectively, while the whole counting\nin the full BZ of the FCI lattice is a 3 \u00d7 2 center of mass translation of this in the x, y directions respectively (see\nFig[3]). In the FQH effect, Ne /Ns = 1/6 and hence the center of mass degeneracy of q = 6 (= qx qy ) and there is no\ncenter of mass degeneracy mismatch between the FQH and the FCI. The FQH relative momentum BZ that remains\nafter the center of mass degeneracy is removed is a 2 \u00d7 2 BZ (GCD(Ns , Ne ) = 2). The Laughlin 1/3 Abelian FQH\ncounting of quasihole states analysis was already presented in Table[I]. In that section, we found that for 2-particles\nin 12 orbitals the quasiholes of the Laughlin state have the following quantum numbers: 2 states in each of the kx , ky\nequal to 0, 2\u03c0/Ly , 2\u03c0/Lx , 0, and 2\u03c0/Lx , 2\u03c0/Ly momenta, and 1 state in the 0, 0 momentum. There is 6-fold center\nof mass degeneracy which multiplies these 7 states to obtain the total of 42 quasihole states. Our theory then implies\nthat the counting of the FCI per relative momentum sector is a px /p = 2-folding of the FQH relative momentum BZ.\nThis folding gives a 2 + 1, 2 + 2 counting for the kx = 0 and ky = 0, 2\u03c0/(Ny a) momenta respectively, which perfectly\nagrees with the numerical data (see Fig[3]).\nFor larger number of particles and quasiholes, the cleanest example of the low-energy manifold of states whose\nimprint characterizes the topological order is seen in the (particle) entanglement spectrum of a FCI groundstate.\nThe particle entanglement spectrum of the groundstate reveals the physics of the excitations of the system in the\nparticular topologically ordered state of the groundstate. It is more robust than the actual energy spectrum because\nthe latter can exhibit aliasing effects due to other states at nearby fillings. Since the Hamiltonian used to obtain the\nspectrum is not a \"model\" Haldane pseudopotential Hamiltonian but a generic Hubbard-like one, adding too many\nquasiholes to the system can, in the energy spectrum, take us to a state at a different filling (with different quasihole\ncounting). However, the entanglement spectrum will keep the topological order (filling) of the original groundstate,\nand reveal directly the quasiholes of that state. For example, if we are looking at the energy spectrum of 4 particles in\n36 orbitals on the lattice, it is possible that instead of seeing the spectrum of 4 electrons in a 1/3 Abelian state with 24\nextra-quasiholes, we could, since the interaction is generic Hubbard, obtain the spectrum of 4 electrons in a filling-1/9\nAbelian state or 4 electrons in a filling 1/7 state with 8 extra-quasiholes. However, the particle entanglement spectrum\nof the groundstate with N = 12 particles in 36 orbitals (filling 1/3) would reveal the physics of the excitations of an\nAbelian 1/3 state if we look at the particle entanglement spectrum (described below) of NA = 4 particles versus the\nrest.\nThe spectrum of the Chern insulator at 1/3 filling has a quasi-degenerate (3-fold, as our analysis would imply)\ngroundstate, at momenta consistent with the folding rule (we wont expand on this rule for the groundstate, as we\nwill give the much more complicated quasihole example). The 3-fold degenerate groundstate of the system contains\ninformation about the Abelian Fractional 1/3 character of the excitation spectrum. This comes out of the recently\ndeveloped entanglement spectrum [11, 12] which for a single non-degenerated ground state |\u03a8i can be defined through\nthe Schmidt decomposition of |\u03a8i in two regions A, B (not necessarily spatial):\n|\u03a8i =\n\nX\ni\n\ne\u2212\u03bei /2 \u03a8A\n\u2297 \u03a8B\ni\ni\n\n(75)\n\nB\nA\n= \u03a8B\n= \u03b4i,j . The exp(\u2212\u03bei ) and \u03a8A\nare the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the reduced\nwhere \u03a8A\ni |\u03a8j\ni |\u03a8j\ni\ndensity matrix, \u03c1A = TrB \u03c1, where \u03c1 = |\u03a8i h\u03a8| is the total density matrix. There is no generalization of the Schmidt\ndecomposition (75) to degenerate groundstates but definition of the entanglement spectrum (ES) through the reduced\ndensity matrix still holds. We want to build a density matrix which commutes with the total translation operators\n-a desirable feature if we want to sort the \u03bei with respect to the momentum quantum P\nnumbers. Such a condition\nis satisfied [11] by the incoherent summation over the degenerate groundstates \u03c1 = 31 i |\u03a8i i h\u03a8i |. Depending on\nwhether the A and B regions are real, momentum or particle space, the ES reveals different aspects of the system's\nexcitations. If the regions A, B are regions of particles, it can be proved [11] that the particle entanglement spectrum\nobtained by tracing over the positions of a set of B particles gives information about the number of quasiholes of\nthe system of NA particles and number of orbitals identical to that of the untraced system.

The spectrum of the one-body flat-band\nChern Hamiltonian [20] with nearest neighbor interaction is given on the left. The counting of the low-energy manifold of\nstates exhibits clear center of mass degeneracies and the relative momentum BZ of the FCI is a 1 \u00d7 2 BZ. The counting per\nmomentum sector in this BZ is a folding of the counting of zero modes of the Haldane FQH pseudopotential whose highest\ndensity state is the Laughlin state. This implies that the universality class of the FCI state is the same as that of the \u03bd = 1/3\nstate.\n\nFQH, the particle entanglement spectrum of a model state (such as Laughlin, MR, etc) contains an identical number\nof levels as those of the quasiholes, thereby providing a numerical check of our analytic proof [11]. Away from the\nmodel states (the Coulomb ground state, for example) the ES may exhibits an entanglement gap [12, 35]. It separates\na low-energy structure with perfect quasihole counting and and a high entanglement energy nonuniversal part. But\na clear and significant gap is not always observed, even for the \u03bd = 1/3 Coulomb state.\nSurprisingly, for the Fractional Chern insulator, the situation is much better: in a previous work [8], we observed a\nclear, large entanglement gap between a manifold of low entanglement energy levels and a manifold of high entanglement energy levels. Moreover, the counting of the levels below the gap is identical to the counting of quasiholes of NA\nparticles in Nx Ny orbitals. We show this for a large-size example. Out of the 3-fold quasi-degenerate groundstate of\n12 particles on the Chern insulator on the checkerboard lattice with Nx \u00d7 Ny = 6 \u00d7 6, we build the density matrix and\nconstruct the entanglement spectrum for NA = 4 particles. The one-body Chern insulator model of [20] presented in\nEq[78], with a two-body nearest neighbor Hubbard U = 1 interaction in the flat-band limit is used to generate the 3fold quasi-degenerate groundstates. The entanglement spectrum has a gap (see Fig[4]); the counting of the low-energy\nmanifold of states below the dot- ted line is 741 in momentum sectors where Nx ( mod 2) = Ny ( mod 2) = 0 and 728\nelsewhere.

The counting of the low-energy manifold of states exhibits\nclear 3 \u00d7 3 fold (in kx , ky ) center of mass degeneracies and the relative momentum BZ of the FCI is a 2 \u00d7 2 BZ. The counting\nper momentum sector in this BZ is a folding of the counting of zero modes of the Haldane FQH pseudopotential whose highest\ndensity state is the Laughlin state. For example, the (0, 0) relative momentum sector of the FCI contains 741 states which\nexactly equals the px /p = py /p = 2 folding 185 + 185 + 185 + 186 of the FQH Laughlin quasihole counting. Likewise, the (0, 1)\nFCI relative momentum sector contains 728 states, which exactly equals the px /p = py /p = 2 folding 182 + 182 + 182 + 182\nof the FQH Laughlin quasihole counting. This implies that the universality class of the FCI state is the same as that of the\n\u03bd = 1/3 state.\n\nTO THE TRIVIAL INSULATOR\n\nof 4 particles in 36 orbitals. The counting per relative momentum sector is a folding of that of the zero modes in the\nFQH state, as the complete analysis of Fig[4] shows.\nAs said in our previous paper [8], we find it very revealing that the FCI groundstates obtained here contain much\nclearer information (large, clear entanglement gap) than the groundstates of the Coulomb interaction in the FQH. The\nentanglement spectrum shows that the groundstates by themselves know of the fractional nature of the excitations\nin the Fractional Chern insulator. The current clean application of the entanglement spectrum also shows that this\nquantity is fundamentally useful towards revealing the physics of strongly-correlated states besides the usual FQH\nmodel wavefunctions. This is even crucial in this case since, despite several attempts[36, 37], there is no analytical\nexpression of the Laughlin state for the FCI to compare with.\n\n\f24\n\na)\n\nb)\n\u0003\u0001 \u0004\n\u0001\u0004\n\u0001\u0002\n\n\u0001\u0004\nE/t1\n\n\u0003\u0001 \u0004\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n1\n0.8\n0\n\n0.6\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nkx Lx / 2 !\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\n0.4\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\nky Ly / 2 !\n\n1 0\n\ne)\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\nFIG. 5: a) One-body model hopping amplitudes in the checkerboard Chern insulator model used in our numerical calculations.\nDirection of the arrow means positive hopping amplitude. b) Dispersion of the model shows that it is an insulator with a nearly\nflat valence band.

We perform exhaustive numerical calculations of both\nthe energy and the entanglement spectra for several interactions at the specific filling where non-Abelian states are\nexpected. The calculations serve as both a numerical check of our emergent translational symmetry principle, as well\nas the first proof of principle that non-Abelian states can be stabilized in a fractionally filled Chern insulator.\nFor our one-body model, we pick the Chern insulator on a checkerboard lattice, first introduced in [9, 10, 20]. This\nmodel already exhibits weak dispersion of the bands (see Fig[5]) like several other models [38\u201340]. But because we\nwork in the flat-band limit, this is not essential to our calculation. With A, B being the two sites in the unit cell, the\none-body, two-band Hamiltonian reads [20]:\nH1 =\n\nX\nk\n\n(c\u2020kA , c\u2020kB )h1 (k)(ckA , ckB )T ,\n\nh1 (k) =\n\nX\n\ndi (k)\u03c3i\n\n(76)\n\ni\n\nwhere the di (k)'s are:\ndx (k) = 4t1 cos(\u03c6) cos(kx /2) cos(ky /2), dy (k) = 4t1 sin(\u03c6) sin(kx /2) sin(ky /2), dz = 2t2 (cos(kx )\u2212cos(ky ))+M (77)\n\n\fThe Moore-Read state\nEnergy spectrum at \u03bd = 1/2 for FCI\nN = 12, Nx = 6, Ny = 4\n\nFQH\nNe=12, Ns=24, p=1, q=2\n3 4 5 6 7\n\nNe=12, Nx=6, Ny=4, px=2, py=3, qx=qy=1\n\n0.21\n\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n\n110011001100110011001100\n011001100110011001100110\n001100110011001100110011\n100110011001100110011001\n101010101010101010101010\n010101010101010101010101\nky (mod 24)\n\nky (mod 12)\n\n6\n\n6\n\n18\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n18\n\n6\n\n12\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nEnergy\n\n0 1 2\n\n25\n\n0.19\n0.18\n0.17\n0.16\n0.15\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nkx * Ny + ky\n\n0 ... 12\n1\n\n1\n\nFold=\n\n25\n\n0 ... 5\n1\n\n0 ... 12\n\n1\n\n0 ... 3\n\nFold\n6-fold almost\ndegenerate groundstate (2 at kx = ky = 0, 4 at\n2\nkx = 0, ky = 4), as predicted by the FQHE to FCI mapping !\n1\n\n1\n\nMultiply by center of\nmass degeneracy\nmismatch q/(qx X qy)=2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0 ... 3\n\n4\n\nNe X Ne FQH relative momentum\nBrillouin zone\n\n0 ... 5\n\nFIG. 6: The spectrum of the three-body Hubbard interaction at filling \u03bd = 1/2 shows two quasi-degenerate states at (0, 0)\nmomentum and 4 states (separated into two quasi-degenerate doublets) at (0, 2) (in units of the smallest lattice momentum).\nThe procedure and folding from FQH to FCI is also presented.\n\nIn the original model [20] there is an additional diagonal term -4t3 cos(kx )cos(ky ) - which shrinks the dispersion of the\nbands, thereby making them flatter, but does not matter for the eigenstates; since we are diagonalizing in the flat-band\nlimit, we neglect such a term. \u03c6 is the phase factor added to the nearest neighbor hopping, while the parameter M is\na mass term added in order to drive the transition from a topological Chern insulator (for M = 0) to a trivial atomic\nlimit insulator when M \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. The model is always gapped (for t1 , t2 , \u03c6 not vanishing) with the exception of the\npoints kx = 0, ky = \u03c0, M = \u22124t2 and kx = \u03c0, ky = 0, M = 4t2 which are gapless and where the phase transitions\nbetween the atomic limits M \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and the Chern insulator phase occur. For |M | < 4|t2 | the filled valence band\nhas a Hall conductance of 1. The single particle Hamiltonian matrix has the following symmetries: inversion with\nidentity inversion matrix h1 (\u2212kx , \u2212ky ) = h1 (kx , ky ), as well as (at M = 0) a certain type-of particle hole symmetry\ncoupled with a C4 rotation and a mirror operation: \u03c3z h1 (kx , ky )\u03c3z = \u2212h1 (ky , kx ). Due to the presence of fractions\nk/2, the model in [20] is not in Bloch form. To render it in Bloch form, we perform the gauge transformation\nckB \u2192 ckB exp(\u2212i(kx \u2212 ky )/2) to obtain:\n!\nh11 (k) h12 (k)\nh2 (k) =\nh?12 (k) \u2212h11 (k)\nh12 (k) = t1 ei\u03c6 (1 + ei(ky \u2212kx ) ) + t1 e\u2212i\u03c6 (eiky + e\u2212ikx )\nh11 (k) = 2t2 (cos(kx ) \u2212 cos(ky )) + M\n\n(78)\n\nThe inversion symmetry of h1 (k) translates into a symmetry of h2 (k) given by U \u2020 (k)h2 (~k)U (k) = h2 (\u2212~k) with U (k)\na diagonal 2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrix with 1, e\u2212i(kx \u2212ky )/2 on the diagonal. To eliminate the effect of the band curvature,\nand to allow the filled particles to democratically sample the whole BZ, we always work in the flat-band limit of\na topological insulator. This corresponds to keeping the single particle eigenstates of h2 (k) but putting the energy\n\n\fBonus stage : the Moore-Read state\n\n26\n\nEnergy spectrum at \u03bd = 1/2 + one flux quantum for\nN = 12, Nx = 5, Ny = 5\n0.165\n0.16\n\nEnergy\n\n0.155\n0.15\n0.145\n0.14\n0.135\n0.13\n0.125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nkx * Ny + ky\n\n7 states in each momentum sector below the dotted line.\nCan we stabilize the MR state with a two-body interaction ?

The energy difference between the valence and conduction bands can hence be made large\nwithout changing the eigenstates of the system.\nWe now fractionally fill the flat valence band of this insulator and add interactions. We diagonalize the interaction\nHamiltonian directly in the filled band, neglecting the conduction band. This is similar to the Lowest-Landau Level\n(LLL) projection in the usual Fractional Quantum Hall Effect. Several interactions we use are:\nX\nHtwo-body =\nnA nB\n(79)\n<AB>\n\nwhere A, B are nearest neighbor A, B sites. In the current section we also use other many-body interactions such as\nthree-body:\nX\nHthree-body =\nnA nB1 nB2 + nB nA1 nA2\n(80)\n<AB1 >,<A,B2 >\n\nwhere B1 , B2 are the two nearest neighbors of the site A and A1 , A2 are the two nearest neighbors of the site B. The\nfirst of the 3-kinds of four-body interactions used in our exact diagonalization reads (see Fig[5]):\nHfour-body 1 =\n\nX\n\nnA1 nA2 nB1 nB2\n\n(81)\n\n<A1 ,B1 >,<A1 ,B2 >,<<A1 ,A2 >>,<<B1 ,B2 >>\n\nwhere B1 , B2 are the two nearest neighbors of the sites A1 , and also of the site A2 . The other two four-body\ninteractions used which we denote Hfour-body\n\u221a 2 , Hfour-body 3 can be easily understood from Fig[5]. All the numerical\ncalculations are performed with t2 = (2 \u2212 2)/2t1 as discussed in [20]. The total translation operators in the x, y\ndirections commute with both the single and many-body Hamiltonian and hence the eigenstates are indexed by total\nmomentum quantum numbers (Kx , Ky ) which are the sum of the momentum quantum numbers of each of the N\nQN\nparticles modulo (Nx , Ny ). The basis states are i=1 \u03b3 \u2020 ~ . . . \u03b3 \u2020 ~ |0i (we work in the \"LLL\", and the \u03b3 \u2020 ~ 's are\n\u2212,k1\n\u2212,kN\n\u2212,k\nthe creation operators for a particle of momentum ~k in the valence band).

Diagonalizing directly in the valence band provides for large numerical efficiency,\nallowing us to go to very large system sizes.

This is the counting predicted by our FQH to FCI mapping.\n\nthe interacting level, and the interacting spectrum has an exact (Kx , Ky ) \u2192 (\u2212Kx , \u2212Ky ) symmetry which can and\nhas been used as checkup. The Htwo-body has been used to obtain the Abelian, filling 1/3 FCI topological state.\nWe now use Hthree-body and, borrowing from FQH experience, we look for the MR Pfaffian at filling \u03bd = 1/2. We\ndiagonalize Hthree-body for up to N = 14 particles on a Nx \u00d7Ny = 7\u00d74 lattice, and present the spectrum in Fig[6]. The\nspectrum is separated into a six-fold quasidegenerate groundstate (at momentum (0, 2) we have four states, separated\ninto two exactly degenerate doublets) at momenta consistent with our FQH to FCI mapping (in this case we also have\nto use the center of mass degeneracy mismatch factor, which is 2). A clear and detailed presentation of the resolution\nof states in momentum sectors is shown in Fig[6]. Both the number of groundstates and their momenta are consistent\nwith the MR Pfaffian state, with a large gap separation to the continuum of states. We now add quasiholes to the\nsystem, by performing the diagonalization of the 3-body Hamiltonian for Ne = 12 electrons on a Nx \u00d7 Ny = 5 \u00d7 5\nlattice. This represents the addition of one flux quantum to the system. The spectrum is seen in Fig[7], and we\nobserve a low-energy manifold of states (below the dashed line) with 7 states in each momentum sector separated by\na clear energy gap from a high-energy continuum of states. This is indeed the correct counting for the non-Abelian\nquasiholes of the MR state based on our emergent symmetry principle. We then close the analysis of the MR state\nby looking at the particle entanglement spectrum of the Ne = 14, Nx = 7, Ny = 4 degenerate states when the number\nof particles not traced out of the system is NA = 6. By our theory, this spectrum should show the counting, per\nmomentum sector, in a low energy manifold of the quasiholes of the MR state for 6 particles in 28 orbitals . The\nresults are presented in Fig[8], where we again see that a low-lying manifold of states is separated by a gap form a\nmanifold of spurious continuum. The number of states per momentum sector below the dotted line in Fig[8] is 8463\nin the even ky sectors, 8486 in the odd ky sectors, the correct numbers of non-Abelian quasiholes predicted by our\nFQH to FCI mapping.\nWe conclude that we have presented sufficient proof that the FCI state at half-filling with three-body potential is\nof MR type in the FCI. We now move to the four-body interaction. The Z3 RR state occurs at filling factor 3/5.\nWe have performed the calculations up to N = 15. Fig. 9 shows the energy spectrum for N = 15 with a lattice size\nNx = Ny = 5. We see a tenfold low energy manifold at momenta consistent with our FQH to FCI mapping, clearly\nseparated from the higher energy continuum. The particle entanglement spectrum of this groundstate manifold is\ngiven in Fig. 9. While all NA sectors display a full entanglement gap, we have chosen the NA = 5 sector. This case\nexhibits an identical counting (2050 states) in all momentum sectors except in the (kx = 0, ky = 0) sector where the\ncounting is 2055. Once again, this result is in agreement with our FQH to FCI mapping.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this manuscript, we have explained the emergent translational symmetry apparent in the low-energy manifold\nof states of a fractionally filled Chern insulator when the insulator exhibits a topologically ordered state.

The number of states\nper momentum sector below the dotted line is 2050 except in the (kx = 0, ky = 0) sector that has 2055 states. This is the\ncorrect counting predicted by our FQH to FCI mapping.\n\nshown that the one-body GMP algebra obtained at long wavelength in [15] maps the problem of a Chern insulator\non a Nx \u00d7 Ny lattice in the problem of a FQH state in the LLL with number of fluxes Ns = Nx Ny piercing the torus\nand with a periodic background potential superimposed on the many-body potential already present in the system.\nWe revisited the continuum FQH problem and presented a detailed derivation of the many-body relative translational\nsymmetries in the system (after the center of mass motion is taken out) presented in a classic paper by Haldane\n[19]. We then showed that the BZ of the FCI is just a folding of the one for the FQH, and pointed out the direct\nconnection between the center of mass degeneracies in the FCI and those in the FQH. This FQH-FCI map allows us\nto compute the number of states that arise per momentum sector of the FCI if the FCI is in the same topological\nphase as the FQH. We showed how to obtain, in the FQH effect, the counting of quasihole states per 2D relative\nmomentum sector for a large series of states exhibiting a generalized Pauli principle [21]. These states include the\nLaughlin, MR and RR series, as well as the Jack polynomials states, the Haffnian[41], and many others, including\nextensions to spin-unpolarized states[42, 43]. The counting construction makes use of only combinatoric methods and\ninvolves counting partitions. We showed how to use the combinatoric counting rule and the FQH-FCI map to obtain\nthe number of states per momentum sector in both the energy and the entanglement spectrum of the FCI at filling\n1/3. We then proceeded on a comprehensive numerical analysis of the spectra of Chern insulators with three and\nfour-body interactions. We provided a proof of principle that Moore-Read states and Read-Reazayi Z3 non-Abelian\nstates can be stabilized in Chern insulators and provided a numerical check of our FQH-FCI mapping.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nBAB wishes to thank Z.

The projected density operator in the lowest band is:\n1 X n1 ? n2\nn2\nP XP = \u221a\nu u\n\u03b3 \u2020 |0i h0| \u03b3k+\u2206q\n= \u03c1\u2206q\nNs k k\u03b1 k+\u2206q n1 k\n\n(96)\n\nHence the projected density operator for \u2206q = 2\u03c0/Nx equals the projected position operator. There is an alternate\nexpression for the projected position and density operators. They are translational operators in k-space:\n1?\nP XP |k, ni = \u03c1\u2206q |k, ni = unk\u2212\u2206q,\u03b1\nunk\u03b1 |k \u2212 \u2206q, n1 i \u2248 e\u2212i\n\nR k+\u2206q\nk\n\nAn1 ,n (k)\n\n|k \u2212 \u2206q, n1 i\n\n(97)\n\nFor one occupied band, the density or position operators just translate the band at different momentum, whereas for\nmore than one occupied bands, the translation is accompanied by a rotation.

Their ratio is\nq\nGCD(Nx , Ne ) * GCD(Ny , Ne )\n=\nqx qy\nGCD(Nx Ny , Ne )\nWe can easily prove that this is an integer by applying the decomposition of a number in primes pi : Nx =\nQ\nQ\nNy = i p\u03b2i i , Ne = i p\u03b8i i where \u03b1i , \u03b2i , \u03b8i are all integer powers. The ratio then becomes:\nY min(\u03b1 ,\u03b8 )+min(\u03b2 ,\u03b8 )\u2212min(\u03b1 +\u03b2 ,\u03b8 )\nq\ni i\ni i\ni\ni i\n=\npi\nqx qy\ni\n\n(106)\nQ\n\ni\n\ni\np\u03b1\ni ,\n\n(107)\n\n\f32\nWe can now analyze the different cases to prove that all powers of pi are positive in the above expression. Since\nour analysis is valid for any i, we drop the index. We have the cases 1) \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b8 in which case\nmin(\u03b1, \u03b8) + min(\u03b2, \u03b8) \u2212 min(\u03b1 + \u03b2, \u03b8) = \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2265 0; 2) \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b8 in which case min(\u03b1, \u03b8) +\nmin(\u03b2, \u03b8) \u2212 min(\u03b1 + \u03b2, \u03b8) = 0; 3) \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b8, \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b8 in which case min(\u03b1, \u03b8) + min(\u03b2, \u03b8) \u2212 min(\u03b1 + \u03b2, \u03b8) = \u03b2; 4)\n\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b8, \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03b1+\u03b2 \u2264 \u03b8 in which case min(\u03b1, \u03b8)+min(\u03b2, \u03b8)\u2212min(\u03b1+\u03b2, \u03b8) = \u03b8\u2212\u03b1 \u2265 0; 5) \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b8, \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b8, \u03b1+\u03b2 \u2265 \u03b8in which\ncase min(\u03b1, \u03b8) + min(\u03b2, \u03b8) \u2212 min(\u03b1 + \u03b2, \u03b8) = \u03b8. We see that in all cases possible, min(\u03b1, \u03b8) + min(\u03b2, \u03b8) \u2212 min(\u03b1 + \u03b2, \u03b8)\nis a positive integer which makes q divisible by qx qy .\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n\nF.
