To appear in Int. J. Theor. Phys.\n\niments are the fuse and the fuel of these activities.\nWe witness the inception of nuclear astrophysics in\nthe 50's, leading to the highly successful theories of\nneutron stars, and particle astrophysics in the 60's exemplified by the highly successful theory of nucleosynthesis which helped to establish the standard model\nin cosmology. Establishment of quantum field theory\nin curved spacetime [6] in the 70's laid the foundation for the study of quantum field processes in strong\ngravity, such as cosmological particle creation in the\nvery early universe [7] and Hawking radiation in black\nholes [8] (Note these two processes contain very different physics). This pushed the frontiers of theoretical\ninquiries in leaps, back to the period after the Planck\ntime. The inflationary cosmology [9] of the 80's also\nushered in ideas of particle physics and quantum field\ntheory, such as the decay of the false vacuum and the\ncapability of vacuum energies driving the universe into\nultrafast expansion, with scenarios radically different\nfrom the standard model.\n\nMain Theme We show that in the collapse of a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) 1 certain processes involved and mechanisms at work share a common origin\nwith corresponding quantum field processes in the early\nuniverse such as particle creation, structure formation\nand spinodal instability. Phenomena associated with\nthe controlled BEC collapse observed in the experiment of Donley et al [2] (they call it 'Bose-Nova', see\nalso [3]) such as the appearance of bursts and jets can\nbe explained as a consequence of the squeezing and\namplification of quantum fluctuations above the condensate by the dynamics of the condensate. Using the\nphysical insight gained in depicting these cosmological\nprocesses, our analysis of the changing amplitude and\nparticle contents of quantum excitations in these BEC\ndynamics provides excellent quantitative fits with the\nexperimental data on the scaling behavior of the collapse time and the amount of particles emitted in the\njets. Because of the coherence properties of BEC and\nthe high degree of control and measurement precision\nin atomic and optical systems, we see great potential\nin the design of tabletop experiments for testing out\ngeneral ideas and specific (quantum field) processes in\nthe early universe, thus opening up the possibility for\nimplementing 'laboratory cosmology'. 2\n\nThis side of the story on the progress of modern cosmology with the help of gravitation theory and particle\nphysics is well-known. What is perhaps lesser known or\nappreciated is the importance of ideas and techniques\nfrom condense matter physics and statistical mechanics in the study of cosmology of the early universe.\nWe have seen the relevance of statistical mechanics, kinetic theory, stochastic processes and many-body dynamics in classical astronomy and physical cosmology\n(see, e.g., [10]). Here we want to emphasize the importance of ideas from condensed matter physics in conjunction with quantum field theory for treating early\nuniverse quantum processes, which is believed to have\nplayed a fundamental role in determining how spacetime and matter existing in different forms and states\ninterplay, transform and evolve. The importance of\n\nTheoretical Cosmology in relation to General Relativity, Particle and Condensed Matter\nPhysics For the last half a century the study of theoretical cosmology and high energy astrophysics has relied largely on general relativity and particle physics,\nwhile modern and contemporary cosmological exper\u2217 Emails:\n\ncalzetta@df.uba.ar, hub@physics.umd.edu\nan excellent introduction to BEC theory, see [1]\n2 This essay has the same content as v2 of [4], with a few\nreferences updated. For more details, see [5].\n1 For\n\n1\n\n\fviewing cosmology in the light of condensed matter\nphysics, in terms of taking the correct viewpoints to\nask the right questions, and approaches to understand\nthe processes, has been called to our attention a long\ntime ago (see, e.g., [11]). There were also proposals to\nstudy cosmological defect formation in helium experiments and to view cosmology as a critical phenomenon\n[12, 13]. Similar efforts aim to identify analogs of full\ncosmological models [14]. A recent monograph is devoted to the unity of forces at work in He3 droplets\n[15]. It should also be mentioned that the proposal of\nsonic black holes [16, 17] was perhaps the first analog\nmodel in black hole physics which stimulated recent\nactivities in finding similar processes in fluids and condensed matter systems in the so-called analog gravity\nprogram [18].\n\nBEC Collapse Experiments In the experiment described by Donley et al. [2], a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a cold (3nK) gas of Rubidium atoms is\nrendered unstable by a sudden inversion of the sign of\nthe interaction between atoms. This is done by altering the binding energy at Feshbach resonance with an\nexternal magnetic field. After a waiting time tcollapse ,\nthe condensate implodes, and a fraction of the condensate atoms are seen to oscillate within the magnetic\ntrap which contains the gas. These atoms are said to\nbelong to a 'burst'. After a time \u03c4evolve the interaction\nis suddenly turned off. For a certain range of values\nof \u03c4evolve , new emissions of atoms from the condensate\nare observed. They are called 'jets'. Jets are distinct\nfrom bursts: they are colder, weaker, and have a characteristic disk-like shape. 3\nThe Model The model is based on the Hamiltonian\noperator for N interacting atoms with mass M in a\ntrap potential V (r) = (\u03c9z2 z 2 + \u03c9\u03c12 \u03c12 )/2, with radial\n\u03c1 and longitudinal z coordinates measured in units\n4\nof aho, where aho is a characteristic length of the\ntrap, with associated (dimensionless) frequencies\n\u03c9z =\n\u221a\n\u03c9axial /\u03c9 \u223c 1/2 and \u03c9\u03c1 = \u03c9radial /\u03c9 \u223c 2. The interaction is assumed to be short ranged. We introduce a\n\nLaboratory Cosmology Here we propose using the\nBose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) and its dynamics as\nanother useful venue to 'observe' and probe into some\nfundamental cosmological processes in the early universe. Specifically, we analyze the experiment performed by Donley et al. [2] on the controlled collapse of a BEC and identify the processes and mechanisms at work which are responsible for vacuum particle creation [7], structure formation [19] and spinodal instability (quenching) in phase transition [20] in\nthe early universe. The collapsing BEC is the timereverse scenario of an expanding universe and the condensate plays a similar role as the vacuum in quantum field theory in curved spacetime. One can understand the production of atoms in the form of jets and\nbursts as the result of parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations by the condensate dynamics. This is\nthe same mechanism as cosmological particle creation\nfrom the vacuum, which is believed to be copious near\nthe Planck time and during preheating after inflation\n[21]. Some basic ideas common to cosmological theories like \"modes freeze when they grow outside of the\nhorizon\" can be used to explain the special behavior\nof jets and bursts ejected from the collapsing BEC. Finally the waiting time before a BEC starts to collapse\nobeys a scaling rule which can be derived from simple\nprinciples of spinodal instability in critical phenomena.\nThese examples clearly indicate the great potential of\na new field of research which we may call \"laboratory\ncosmology\", with tabletop experiments designed to test\nthe workings of specific physical mechanisms in specific\ncosmological processes.\n\n3 We call attention to the distinction between the 'Bose-Nova'\n[2] experiment studied here and other BEC collapse experiments\n[22, 23]. At magnetic fields around 160G, where the effective\nscattering length is of the order of 500a0 (and positive)(a0 =\n0.529 10\u221210 m\nis the Bohr radius) it is possible to observe\noscillations between the usual atomic condensate and the molecular state [23] with a frequency of oscillations of hundreds of\nKHz [24]. By contrast, in the 'Bose-Nova' experiment [2] typical\nfields were around 167G, the scattering length was only tens of\nBohr radii (and negative) and the frequency of atom - molecule\noscillations may be estimated as well over ten MHz [25]. While\ncoherent resonance between the atoms and the molecules is expected to exist for all of these experiments, and has been shown\nto play an important role in the outcomes of some [25], we deem\nit unlikely that it plays a dominant role in this experiment other\nthan renormalizing the scattering length (For details, see [5]).\nIndeed no oscillations are reported in the original experimental paper. Instead, as this note shows, the primary mechanism\nfor the Bose Nova phenomena is the parametric amplification of\nquantum fluctuations by the condensate dynamics, resulting in\nbursts and jets as particle production from (the squeezing of) the\nvacuum. Recent numerical simulations [26] and rigorous theoretical investigations [27] indicating the inadequacy of mean field\ntheory seem to corroborate this view.\n4 We use a sign convention such that the effective coupling\nconstant is positive for an attractive interaction, and a system of units where the length aho , time tho and energy scale\nEho = h\u0304\u03c9 = M \u03c9 2 a2ho are defined with reference to the average\nfrequency \u03c9. We work with units such that these three scales\ntake the value 1.\n\n2\n\n\f\u22123/2\n\ndimensionless field operator \u03a8 (r) \u2261 aho \u03a8 (x), and\n\u0001\u22121\na dimensionless coupling constant u = h\u0304\u03c9a3ho\nU=\n4\u03c0 (a/aho ).\ni\nh\n\n\u0003\n\u2202\u03b7 \u0002\n+ H \u2212 E0 \u2212 2u\u03a620 \u03be = 0.\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nSince the trap Hamiltonian is time - independent, we\nhave\n\n\u03a8 obeys the equation of motion \u03a8\u0307 = i \u0124, \u03a8\nand\nsatisfies the \u0003equal time commutation relations\n\u0002\n\u03a8 (t, r) , \u03a8\u2020 (t, r\u2032 ) = \u03b4 (3) (r \u2212 r\u2032 ) . We decompose the\nHeisenberg operator \u03a8 = \u03a6(r, t) + \u03c8(r, t) into a cnumber condensate amplitude \u03a6 and a q-number noncondensate amplitude \u03c8, consisting of the fluctuations\nor excitations.\nOne crucial point of our analysis is that we shall\nfocus on the evolution of the fluctuations for a given\nevolution of the condensate (as extracted from the experiments); in field theory terms, we shall work within\nthe test field approximation. It is fair to say that a full\ntheoretical account of the Bose - Nova experiment, describing the evolution of both condensate and fluctuations, does not exist. All we can say with any certainty\nis that we face here a strong back reaction regime, beyond the Hartree - Fock - Bogoliubov approximation\n[28].\nIn contradistinction, the dynamics of the fluctuations alone may be described, at least in the early\nstages of the experiment, by a simple Bogoliubov approximation [29]. We obtain the equation of motion\nfor the fluctuation field by subtracting from the full\nHeisenberg equation the Gross - Pitaievsky equation\n(GPE) for \u03a6. We next parametrize the wave functions\nas \u03a6 = \u03a60 e\u2212i\u0398 , \u03c8 = \u03c80 e\u2212i\u0398 , where \u03a60 and \u0398 are\nreal. During the early stages of evolution, we may regard the condensate density as time independent, and\nthe condensate phase as homogeneous, \u03a60 = \u03a60 (r) ,\n\u0398 = \u0398 (t). We may then write the equation for the\nfluctuation field\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2202\ni \u2212 H + E0 \u03c80 + u\u03a620 \u03c80 + \u03c80\u2020 = 0 (1)\n\u2202t\n\n\u22022\u03be\n+ [H \u2212 E0 ] Hef f \u03be = 0.\n\u2202t2\n\n(4)\n\nHere Hef f = H \u2212 E0 \u2212 2u\u03a620 . To have an unstable condensate it is necessary that at least one of the eigenvalues of Hef f is negative; the boundary of stability\noccurs when the lowest eigenvalue is exactly zero.\nOne further consideration is that we are interested\nin the part of the fluctuation field which remains orthogonal to the condensate. In the full theory, the condensate is the eigenfunction of the one - body density\nmatrix with the largest (macroscopic) eigenvalue, and\nthe non-condensate is built out of the other eigenstates\n[33]. Since the one-body density matrix is Hermitian,\nthey must be orthogonal. The ground state of Hef f is\ncertainly not orthogonal to the condensate, since neither have nodes. Observe that within our approximations, the noncondensate wave function is equivalent,\nup to a normalization, to the phonon operator in the\nparticle- conserving formalism [34].\n\u221a\nIf we adopt the values \u03c9z = 1/2, \u03c9\u03c1 = 2, relevant\nto the JILA experiment, then instability occurs when\n\u03ba = N0 acrit /aho = 0.51. This result compares remarkably well with the experimental value \u03ba = 0.55 [2, 25],\nas well as with the theoretical estimate presented in\nRef. [35]. This agreement may be seen as natural, as\nthe equations we postulate for the fluctuations may be\nobtained from the linearization of the GPE. In both\ncalculations, the geometry of the trap plays a fundamental role.\n\nScaling of tcollapse and Critical Dynamics As we\nhave already noted, even for condensate densities above\nthe stability limit, no particles are lost from the condensate during a waiting time tcollapse . Experimentally,\ntcollapse is seen to get very large when the threshold\nof stability is approached from above, in a way which\nclosely resembles the critical slowing down near the\n\u2202\u03be\n= [H \u2212 E0 ] \u03b7\n(2) transition point characteristic of critical dynamics.

As it is well known, this\napproximation is both \"gapless\" and \"conserving\" [30].\nTo solve equation (1)5 we decompose \u03c80 into a selfadjoint and an anti-adjoint part \u03c80 = \u03be + i\u03b7, each part\nsatisfying an equation\n\n3\n\n\fcorresponds to the critical point.

The fact that particles in bursts are seen\nbest fit to the experimental data is obtained for tcrit \u223c to oscillate with the trap frequencies [2] also suggests\n5ms.\nthat their dynamics is determined by the trap Hamiltonian.

In practice, \u03ba\u22121 is a measure of\n10\nthe overlap between the condensate and the excitation\n8\nmodes. Therefore, the approximation may be improved\n6\nby adjusting \u03ba according to the range of modes where\n4\nit will be applied.\n2\nLet N\u03040 be the initial number of particles in the condensate, and acr = \u03ba/N\u03040 the corresponding critical\na_collapse\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nscattering length.

This is plotted in Fig 3, for N\u03040 = 16, 000,\n\u03c9radial = 110 Hz, \u03c9axial = 42.7 Hz, a = 36a0 , and\n\u03ba = 0.46 , and compared to the corresponding results\nas reported in [2].\n\ndensity is growing exponentially, but unlike the previous case, there is no oscillatory component, and these\nparticles do not oscillate in the trap, in the sense described above. These modes come alive at \u03c4evolve (as\nthe scattering length is set to zero), whence they become ordinary trap modes which oscillate in the trap\nin the same way as the the burst modes . To the observer, they appear as a new ejection of particles from\nthe core of the condensate, which makes up the socalled 'jets'. The sudden activation of a frozen mode\n(we are borrowing the language and concept of cosmological structure formation) by turning off the particle\n- particle interaction may be described as a \"thaw\".\nObserve that in this picture several conspicuous features of jets become obvious. Jets may only appear if\nthe turn - off time \u03c4evolve is earlier than the formation\ntime of the remnant. Once the condensate becomes\nstable again, there are no more frozen modes to thaw.\nOn the other hand, jets will appear (as observed) for\n\u03c4evolve < tcollapse , when the condensate has not yet\nshed any particles. Also jets must be less energetic\nthan bursts, since they are composed of lower modes.\nBeyond tcollapse the number of particles in the condensate, and therefore the instantaneous frequency of\nthe excited modes, becomes time dependent. If we confine ourselves to the early stages of collapse we may\nassume nevertheless that the condensate remains homogeneous. Shifting the origin of time to tcollapse for\nsimplicity, we write N0 (t) = N\u03040 exp (\u2212t/\u03c4 ) (see Fig.\n2).\n\nNumber in jet\n2000\n1750\n1500\n1250\n1000\n750\n500\n250\n2\n\n14000\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nt\n\nWe see that the agreement is excellent at early times\n(up to about 6ms). For later times, this model overestimates the jet population. This is due to the fact that,\nby not considering the shrinking of the condensate, we\nare overestimating the overlap between the condensate\nand the fluctuations, thus delaying the thaw. It nevertheless reproduces the overall slope of particle number with \u03c4evolve ,. It should also be remembered that\nwe are computing the expected number of particles,\nbut in the highly squeezed state which results from the\nfrozen period, the fluctuations in particle number are\ncomparable to the mean number itself.\nIt is interesting to observe that it is possible to reproduce the jets within a theory where the GPE equation\nis generalized to include an imaginary three - body recombination loss term [40]. We do not regard this as\nnecessarily a different explanation, but rather as a different way of handling the divide between condensate\nand non-condensate (the analogous cosmological problem would be whether to consider a spin two fluctuation\ngenerated during Inflation as a test field on the cosmological background, or as part of the geometry). Still\nagreement with the observed jets is obtained only for\ncertain ranges of parameters, and it is unclear whether\nany single parameter set gives a satisfactory simultaneous account of all aspects of the experiment [28].\nIn this talk, we have presented a new viewpoint towards understanding the salient features in the physics\nof controlled collapse of a Bose-Einstein condensate described in the experiment of [2], i.e, in terms of quantum vacuum fluctuations parametrically amplified by\n\n16000\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 3:\n\nNumber in condensate\n18000\n\n2\n\n4\n\ntime\n\nFigure 2:\nAfter expanding in trap eigenmodes we find the\n\u0001 two\nkinds of behavior described above.

During the frozen period, the modes are amplified, but they only contribute to bursts after thawing. If the evolution is interrupted while still frozen,\nthey appear as a jet.
