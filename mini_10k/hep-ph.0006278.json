INTRODUCTION\n\nParticle physics models where there are large hidden space dimensions beyond the three\nfamiliar ones have been the focus of intense activity during the past two years [1,2]. Beyond\nthe simple reason that such extra dimensions are predicted by string theories, a major point\nof interest in these models is that often these large extra dimensions come with a TeV scale\nfor the strings which leads to a plethora of new observable phenomena in collider as well in\nother arenas of particle physics and cosmology.\n\n\u2217 e-mail:rmohapat@physics.umd.edu\n\u2020 e-mail:aplorenz@Glue.umd.edu\n\n1\n\n\fIn order for these models to provide a satisfactory description of low energy particle\nphysics, they must handle some obvious problems that come with the existence of a fundamental scale in the multi-TeV range. One such problem has to do with understanding the\nsmall neutrino masses in a natural manner. The conventional seesaw [3] explanation which\nis believed to provide the most satisfactory way to understand this, requires that the new\nphysics scale (or the scale of SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L ) be around 1012 GeV or higher. Clearly, low\nstring scale theories do not have any fundamental scale of that type. Moreover, the low value\nof the string scale leads to enhanced (and unacceptable) contributions to neutrino masses\nfrom higher dimensional operators. While there are suggestions involving thick branes with\npoint splitting [4] to remedy similar problems that arise from \u2206B 6= 0 operators, they don't\nwork for neutrino mass operators. Therefore, a necessary ingredient to understand small\nneutrino masses in the low string scale models is to assume that theory have a B \u2212 L symmetry. This will forbid higher dimensional operators LHLH/M \u2217 (M \u2217 is the string scale),\nwhich are the source of the problem for neutrino masses.\nDepending on whether B \u2212 L is a global or local symmetry, one can have two ways to\nsolve the neutrino mass problem in models with large extra dimensions1 . In the former case,\ndiscussed in [6], one has to introduce singlet bulk neutrinos which then lead to small Dirac\nmasses for them. On the other hand, if B \u2212 L symmetry is chosen to be a local symmetry,\nanomaly cancellation requires that, right handed neutrinos be present in the brane as in the\nmodels discussed in Ref. [7,8]. Since local B \u2212 L must be broken to avoid massless gauge\nbosons, one again has to deal with the induced operators of the same type as above with\nM \u2217 = MB\u2212L . It was shown in Ref. [7,8] that to get neutrino masses in the desired eV range,\none must have string scale M \u2217 \u2243 MB\u2212L \u223c 109 GeV range or higher. As a result, a class of\nexperimentally accessible phenomenological predictions are lost, although long range gravity\ntests are still possible. These models are similar to the ones discussed in [9].\nIn the context of models that have global U(1)B\u2212L symmetry, one can maintain the TeV\nscale for the strings and still get small neutrino masses by introducing isosinglet neutrinos\nin the bulk as has already been discussed in Ref. [6]. These models are interesting because a\nvery minimal set of particles beyond the standard model are sufficient to get small neutrino\nmasses. Key reason for this result is the relation between the fundamental scale, M \u2217 , the\nradius of the extra dimensions, R, and effective Planck scale, MP l ,\nM \u22172+n Rn = MP2 l ,\n\n(1)\n\nSince the singlet neutrino is a bulk field, the effective couplings of its Fourier modes to the\nstandard model fields are naturally suppressed by the ratio M \u2217 /MP l , which for a TeV M \u2217\nproduces the right order of magnitude for neutrino masses.\nAn analysis of the implications of the mixing profile in these models for solar neutrino\ndeficit was discussed in [10]. Also, implications for atmospheric neutrinos were discussed\nin [11], and some phenomenological bounds were given in [10\u201313]. Our goal in this paper is to\n\n1 It\n\nis generally believed that string theories do not have any global symmetries [5], which would\nseem to imply that B\u2212L must be a local symmetry. In our discussion, however, we will consider that\nB \u2212L is a global symmetry of the theory, as in Ref. [6] and see where it leads us phenomenologically.\n\n2\n\n\fattempt a unified explanation of all known neutrino oscillation data i.e. solar, atmospheric\nas well as LSND under different assumptions for the initial input parameters for the minimal\nbulk neutrino scenario.\nThe basic reason for embarking on such an ambitious program is the encouraging feature\nthat the masses of the lower KK modes of the bulk neutrinos are given by integral multiples\nof R\u22121 which is of order 10\u22123 eV when R \u223c millimeter. This is of the right order necessary to\nsolve the solar neutrino problem via small angle MSW mechanism using \u03bde to \u03bds oscillation.\nThus we see that there exists a natural way to understand the lightness of the sterile neutrino\n[8,10,14], a situation if realized would pose a major challenge to four dimensional theories.\nOnce the solar neutrino problem is understood, it would appear that all the necessary\ningredients are at hand to understand the atmospheric and LSND data using oscillations\namong the familiar neutrinos i.e. \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc for LSND and \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 for atmospheric.\nThis program has already been undertaken in special parameter domains and it has\nalready been suspected [8,11] that it does not really work. Our goal is to extend these\ndiscussions to a somewhat larger parameter domain to see if there is chance for this program\nto succeed and unfortunately our answer is also in the negative. Our work complements the\nabove works and extends them. Specifically, we try to give analytical reasonings to see how\nthe different oscillation data can (or cannot) be understood. Since we do not take recourse to\na detailed numerical analysis, we cannot rule out the possibility that some small parameter\ndomain exists where all data can be accommodated; but we consider that unlikely.\nThe negative conclusion of our work, combined with the works of [8,11] implies with\nvirtual certainty that in the large extra dimension framework, understanding the neutrino\ndata does require new physics beyond the standard model in the brane or new physics in\nextra dimensions or both.\nOur basic strategy is as follows: we start by requiring that the parameters of the theory\nprovide an explanation for solar and atmospheric oscillations. Then we ask whether they\ncan account for the small LSND probability of \u03bde appearance from the \u03bd\u03bc beam.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in section II, we discuss neutrino oscillations with\na single flavour, which depends on two parameters, the bulk radius and a dimensionless\nparameter \u03be related to the Dirac mass term in the theory. The latter defines the pattern of\nneutrino oscillations. This analysis sets the stage for the three flavour case, which we discuss\nin section III for various possible domains of the parameter space. We end the paper with\na concluding section that summarizes the results and discusses their implications.\nII. OSCILLATIONS WITH A SINGLE FLAVOUR\n\nLet us begin our discussion by focusing on the simplest case with one generation of\nfermions in the brane and one bulk neutrino, to understand the general profile of the neutrino\noscillations in models with large extra dimensions. We will discuss the necessary ingredients\nto understand the three flavour case that is explored in the next section. Obviously, the\nfields that could propagate in the extra dimensions are chosen to be gauge singlets. Let\nus denote bulk neutrino by \u03bdB (x\u03bc , y). It has a five dimensional kinetic energy term and a\ncoupling to the brane field L(x\u03bc ) given by\nL = \u03baL\u0304H\u03bdBR (x, y = 0) +\n\nZ\n\ndy \u03bd\u0304BL (x, y)\u22025 \u03bdBR (x, y) + h.c.\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere from the five dimensional kinetic energy, we have only kept the 5th component that\ncontributes to the mass terms of the KK modes in the brane; H denotes the Higgs doublet,\nM\u2217\nand \u03ba = h M\nthe suppressed Yukawa coupling. It is worth pointing out that this suppression\nPl\nis independent of the number and radius hierarchy of the extra dimensions, provided that\nour bulk neutrino propagates in the whole bulk. For simplicity, we will assume that there\nis only one extra dimension with radius of compactification as large as a millimiter, and the\nrest with much smaller compactification radii. The smaller dimensions will only contribute\nto the relationship (1) but its KK excitations will be very heavy and decouple from neutrino\nspectrum. Thus, all the analysis could be done as in five dimensions.\nThe first term in Eq. (2) will be responsible for the neutrino mass once the Higgs field\ndevelops its vacuum. The induced Dirac mass parameter will be given by m = \u03bav, which\nfor M \u2217 = 1 TeV is about h * 10\u22125 eV. Obviously this value depends only linearly on the\nfundamental scale. Larger values for M \u2217 will increase m proportionally. After introducing\nthe expansion of the bulk field in terms of the KK modes, the Dirac mass terms in (2) could\nbe written as\n!\n!\n\u221a\n\u03bd\nm\n2m\n0B\n\u2032\n(\u03bd\u0304eL \u03bd\u0304BL\n)\n,\n(3)\n\u2032\n\u03bdBR\n0 \u22025\nwhere\nour notation is as follows: \u03bdB\u2032 represents the\u221aKK excitations, the off diagonal term\n\u221a\n2m is actually an infinite row vector of the form 2m(1, 1, * * *). The operator \u22025 stands\nfor the diagonal and infinite KK mass matrix whose n-th entrance is given by n/R. This\nnotation was introduced in [7] to represent the infinite mass matrix in a compact manner.\nUsing this short hand notation makes it easier to calculate the exact eigenvalues and the\neigenstates of this mass matrix [8]. Simple algebra yields the characteristic equation\n2\u03bbn = \u03c0\u03be 2 cot(\u03c0\u03bbn ),\n\n(4)\n\n\u221a\nwith \u03bbn = mn R, \u03be = 2mR, and where mn is the mass eigenvalue [6,10]. The eigenstates,\non the other hand are given symbolically by [8]\n\u221a\n\"\n#\n2m\u22025 \u2032\n1\n\u03bdL + 2\n,\n(5)\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\u0303nL =\nNn\nmn \u2212 \u220252 BL\nwhere the sum over the KK modes in the last term is implicit. Nn is the normalization\nfactor given by\nNn2 =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 2\n\u03bb\n+\nf\n(\u03be)\n,\n\u03be2 n\n\n(6)\n\nwhere f (\u03be) = \u03be 2 /2 + \u03c0 2 \u03be 4 /4. Figures 1 and 2 depict the exact numerical results of \u03bbn and\nNn for several choices for the value of the \u03be parameter. Using the expression (5), we can\nwrite down the weak eigenstate \u03bdL in terms of the massive modes as\n\u03bdL =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n\u03bd\u0303nL .\nn=0 Nn\n\n(7)\n\nThus, the weak eigenstate is actually a coherent superposition of an infinite number of\nmassive modes. Therefore, even for this single flavour case, the time evolution of the mass\n4\n\n\feigenstates involves in principle all mass eigenstates and is very different from the simple\noscillatory behaviour familiar from the conventional two or three neutrino case. The time\ndependent survival probability is given by\nL\n\n2\n\nei 2ER2 \u03bbn\nPsurv (L) = |h\u03bdL (L)|\u03bdL (0)i|2 =\nNn2\nn=0\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\n\n= 1\u22122\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nsin2\n\nk,n=0\n\n\u0010\n\nL\n(\u03bb2n\n4ER2\nNn2 Nk2\n\n\u2212 \u03bb2k )\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nIt is clear that the survival probability depends strongly on the parameter \u03be, reflecting the\nuniversal coupling of all the KK components of \u03bdB with \u03bdL in (2). Figures 3 and 4 show the\nprofile of the survival probability obtained from the numerical solutions for three different\nvalues of \u03be and is clearly very different from simple familiar oscillatory behaviour. However,\nto better understand these results, we will follow an analytical approach in what follows.\nIt is simpler to consider the two limiting cases. First let us assume that \u03be \u226a 1. As already\nknown [8,10], the eigenvalues in this case are given by \u03bb0 = mR, and \u03bbn = n otherwise.\nTherefore, to a good approximation, we may take the mixing parameters N0 = \u03b7, and\nNn = (n/\u03be)\u03b7 for non zero n. Where the extra factor \u03b7 = (1 + \u03c0 2 \u03be 2 /6)1/2 is introduced to\nkeep the proper normalization in the expansion (7). This approximation is confirmed by our\nfigures 1 and 2. The survival probability is now given as\nPsurv (L) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n4 2\n\u03be\n\u03b7 4 n=1\n\nsin2\n\n\u0010\n\nn2 L\n4ER2\nn2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2 4\n\u03be\n\u03b7 4 k,n=1\n\nsin2\n\n(n2 \u2212k 2 )L\n4ER2\n2\nn k2\n\nh\n\ni\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nIt is simple to see from last expression that the probability has an oscillation length Losc =\n4\u03c0ER2 . A typical profile in this case is depicted in figure 4. Also, the main contribution\nto the oscillation pattern comes from the lowest elements of the tower, which turns out to\nbe the main component of \u03bdL . Another way to see this result is to note that \u03be could be\nmade small by making R small; but this makes the KK excitation masses large so that they\ndecouple from the light sector of the theory leaving only the right handed component of\nthe zero mode of the bulk neutrino, \u03bdBR to form a Dirac mass with \u03bdL and stay light. The\nleft-handed zero mode decouples and remains massless.\nIn the \u03be \u226a 1 limit, the small mixing with the tower elements leads to an oscillation\npattern dominated by the lightest KK mode with a mass just about 1/R and more or less\nsimulate the familiar oscillatory one. This can happen, for instance, if R \u223c 0.2 mm, which\ngives 1/R2 \u223c 10\u22126 eV 2 , just about what it is needed to provide an explanation to the solar\nneutrino problem assuming a small MSW mixing angle [10]. To use this case to compare\nwith solar neutrino data, one needs to include the matter effect, which has already been\ndiscussed in Ref. [10] and we do not enter into this here.\nA more direct application of the formula in Eq. (9) can be made to discuss the atmospheric neutrino oscillations, which is a vacuum oscillation. However, to get the equivalent\nof large mixing angle we need to adjust \u03be \u223c 1 and 1/R2 \u223c \u2206m2atm , which means that Eq.\n(9) is not applicable and we must therefore use Eq. (8) and study its large \u03be limit.\nTo discuss this, we start with the limit when \u03be \u226b 1. First thing to note is that the\npattern of eigenvalues is very different in this case from the small \u03be case. For small values\nof n the eigenvalues are well approximated by \u03bbn = 2n+1\n, while Nn becomes n independent\n2\nuntil certain cut off value that roughly speaking is given by n\u039b = \u03c0 2 \u03be 2/4. Beyond that\npoint \u03bbn \u2248 n and we may no longer neglect the contribution of \u03bbn to (6). This results in\n5\n\n\fa suppression of Nn that goes like 1/n. It should therefore be reasonable to consider as a\nfirst approximation that the expansion (7) is cut off at n\u039b , and that all the mass eigenstates\n\u221a\ncontributing to \u03bdL are equally suppressed by 1/ n\u039b . In this approximation, we obtain the\nsurvival probability to be\nPsurv (L) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nn\u039b\n2 X\nL\n2\n2\n2\n(\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n)\n.\nsin\nk\nn\u039b 2 k,n=0\n4ER2 n\n\n(10)\n\nCertainly, this relation presents a oscillatory profile, however, the superposition of the equally\nsuppressed oscillations will result most of the time on a destructive interference, with the\nexception of the very sharp resonances that appear each time L reaches a multiple of the\noscillation length. In other words, \u03bdL is a superposition of a large number of mass eigenstates,\nwith masses covering a large range, from 1/2 to n\u039b in units of 1/R, all of them contributing by\nthe same amount. As a result, once \u03bdL is released, one may surmise that the time evolution\nof the different components will most likely wash out the original coherent superposition\nand the initial \u03bdL will almost disappear. As fig. 3 shows, this conclusion is borne out by the\nthe numerical analysis. To get an analytical result that also supports this conclusion, note\nthat in the sum in Eq. (10), the dominant contributions come when n 6= k in which case\neach term in the sum averages to 1/2 and on performing the double sum it is easy to see\nthat one arrives at P\u0304surv \u2248 1/n\u039b .\nIf n\u039b is very large, it suppresses the survival probability too much and cannot help in\nthe understanding of the atmospheric data. So, clearly, if we wanted an understanding of\nthe atmospheric data, we must assume smaller \u03be, perhaps values closer to one. In this case,\ntruncating the sum in the expression for the survival probability in Eq. (9), cannot be\njustified and we must seek an alternative way to deal with Eq. (8). An approach suggested\nin [11] is to use a continuous approximation to the sum in Eq. (8), which leads to\nPsurv (z) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c02\u03be 4\n4f (\u03be)\n\neizn\n\u03be4 =\ndn 2\nn + f (\u03be)\n\n!\n\n1 \u2212 erf\n\n\u0012q\n\nizf (\u03be)\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere z = L/2ER2 . Clearly, for large \u03be; f (\u03be) \u223c \u03c0 2 \u03be 4 /4, and last expression in Eq. (11)\nsimplifies. In order to study the dependence of Psurv (z) on \u03be, we plot Psurv in Fig. 3 in\nthe continuous and discrete approximations. One thing that emerges is the non-oscillatory\nnature of the function as we exceed \u03be = 1. We also see that the continuous limit gives a good\napproximation for the slope (see figure 3), even for cases where \u03be \u2264 1 [11]. This expression,\nhowever, does not represent the survival probability in the limit \u03be \u226a 1, since in this case\n(i.e. \u03be \u226a 1), the Psurv has an oscillatory behaviour unlike the last term in Eq. (11) (see\nfigure 4). In the overlap region close to \u03be \u2243 1, one may evaluate the second term in Eq. (11)\nin a slightly different way which leads to an expression for the survival probability as\nPsurv (\u03b6) = \u03c12 (\u03b6) + \u03b82 (\u03b6),\n\n(12)\nq\n\nq\n\nwhere we have introduced the new variable \u03b6 = zf (\u03be) = (\u03c0\u03be 2 /2R) L/2E and the functions \u03c1(\u03b6) = 1 \u2212 C(\u03b6) \u2212 S(\u03b6); and \u03b8(\u03b6) = C(\u03b6) \u2212 S(\u03b6) with S and C the sine and cosine\nFresnel integrals:\nC(\u03b6) =\n\ns\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b6\n\n2\n\ndt cos(t )\n\nand\n6\n\nS(\u03b6) =\n\ns\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b6\n\ndt sin(t2 ).\n\n\fWe draw attention to the fact that \u03b6 involves not only the model parameters \u03be and R but\nalso the experimental variable z. Thus for a given model, the variable \u03b6 has different values\nfor different oscillation experiments; for instance, for the atmospheric neutrino case, a typical\n2\nvalue for \u03b6 \u223c \u03c0\u03be\n1.2 \u00d7 102 eV\u22121 .\n2R\nThe expression (12) is valid just before Psurv (\u03b6) reaches the average, P\u0304surv = 4/\u03c0 2 \u03be 2 . In\nfigure 5 we present the behaviour of \u03c1, \u03b8 and Psurv . Note the steep fall off of Psurv as \u03b6 increases. For \u03b6 = 1, Psurv has already dropped under 20%, which is smaller than the observed\ndeficit in solar and atmospheric data. Therefore, if we want to fit the overall suppression of\nthe atmospheric neutrinos, we must remain in a very narrow range of parameters. A rough\nestimate of these parameters may be obtained by expanding (12) to first order on \u03b6, which\nyields\ns\n\n\u221a\n2\n\u03be2\nPsurv (\u03b6) \u2248 1 \u2212 2\n\u03b6 =1\u22122 \u03c0\n\u03c0\nR\n\n!\u0012\n\nL\n4E\n\n\u0013 21\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nNow, we may invert the last equation to get\n\u03be2\n(1 \u2212 P\u0304exp ) L\n\u221a\n\u2243\nR\n4E\n4\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u2212 12\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nexp\n\nUsing average values for the L, E and Pexp for atmospheric neutrinos, we find \u03be 2 /R \u2248\n10\u22122 eV . Note that this naive approximation gives just about the value obtained by the\nnumerical fitting of the data in [11]. For this value, as \u03be > 1, we get R in the range\n10\u22123 eV < 1/R < 10\u22122 eV implying 1 < \u03be 2 < 10. Thus a solution to the atmospheric\nneutrino puzzle using KK modes requires that R be in the sub-millimeter range. This in\nturn determines how large M \u2217 should be to avoid any unwanted large fine tuning. We see\nthat for m \u2265 10\u22123 eV and Yukawa coupling h of order one, we need M \u2217 \u2265 100 T eV .\nWe also point out that in the case of \u03be \u2265 1, extra dimensions must be much larger than a\nmillimeter if we want to fit the solar neutrino data either via MSW or via vacuum oscillation.\nTo see this note that if we take \u2206m2sol \u223c 10\u22126 eV2 , this would imply L/4E \u223c 1/\u2206m2sol \u223c 106\neV\u22122 . Putting this in Eq. (13), we get \u03be 2 /R \u2243 10\u22124 eV. For \u03be \u226b 1, this implies that R \u226b 0.2\nmm. Similar estimate for the case of vacuum oscillation yields R \u226b 2 cm. Therefore, in all\nour discussion of solar neutrino oscillations involving the bulk neutrinos, we will work in the\napproximation \u03be \u226a 1.\nLet us now summarize our findings for a single neutrino case: for \u03be \u226a 1, Psurv has an\noscillatory behaviour as given by (9). As \u03be approaches 1, \u03bbn starts to deviate from the\ninteger value n, which in turn disturbs the periodic nature of Psurv and the maximum and\nminimum values of probability are not reached away from the source [6]. This picture gets\nworse as one approaches \u03be \u226b 1 when a very sharp slope drives the probability near zero as\nwe move away from the source of the neutrinos and it remains around its average, 4/\u03c0 2\u03be 2 ,\nmost of the time. For this reason, whenever we try to fit the atmospheric neutrino data\nwith bulk neutrinos, the value of \u03be must be tuned to a very narrow range.\nLet us apply the discussions of this section to study how the oscillation of known neutrinos\nto bulk ones would effect the current experiments such as CHOOZ-PALOVERDE, LSND and\nthe atmospheric neutrinos. For this purpose, we first note that in contrast with the usual two\nneutrino oscillation case, where the pattern is determined by three parameters, the mixing\n7\n\n\fangle \u03b8, the \u2206m2 and L/4E for the experiment, in the case of bulk neutrino oscillation,\nwe have L/4E characterizing an experiment like before, bulk radius R, which replaces \u2206m2\n(which we will assume to be in the milli-meter range) and model parameter \u03be (which is\nthe analog of the mixing angle). For a given R, \u03be is the only parameter characterizing the\noscillation pattern. In Fig. 6, we plot the variation of the survival probability Psurv against \u03be\nfor the various cases mentioned above for a typical characteristic value of L/4E. We see from\nthis figure that to explain the observed overall deficit of atmospheric neutrinos by nearly\n50%, one needs to go to \u03be \u223c 1.5 or so. This conclusion is in acoord with our conclusion\nbased on Eq. (14) above.\nIII. THREE FLAVOUR OSCILLATIONS\n\nLet us now apply the discussion of the previous section to the case of three standard\nmodel generations in the brane so that we have three brane neutrinos \u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4 . To give masses\nto all of them in a minimal scenario, we will use three bulk neutrinos and allow arbitrary\nYukawa couplings between the bulk and the brane neutrinos. This leads to an arbitrary\nDirac mass matrix that involves the familiar left-handed neutrinos and the right handed\nKaluza-Klein modes of the bulk neutrinos. As already discussed in [8], the most general\nDirac mass terms with three flavours may be written, after a rotation of the bulk fields, as\nL = \u03bd\u0304L * UMD * \u03bdBR (y = 0) +\n\nZ\n\ndy \u03bd\u0304BL * \u22025 * \u03bdBR + h.c.,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere U is a unitary matrix and MD = Diag(m1 , m2 , m3 ), in the basis where \u03bdL =\n(\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 )L ; and \u03bdB = (\u03bdB1 , \u03bdB2 , \u03bdB3 ). The mass parameters m\u03b1 are just the eigenvalues of\nthe Yukawa coupling matrix multiplied by v, the vacuum expectation value of the standard\nmodel doublet field. They are of the order of eV or less since the couplings of the bulk modes\nto the brane fields are naturally suppressed, as already stated on the previous section.\nNow, to simplify the discussion, we rotate the weak eigenstate neutrinos \u03bda to the ones\nrelated to the weak eigenstates by the rotation U i.e. \u03bda = Ua\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 , where a = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 and\n\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3. We then have\nL=\n\n3 \u0014\nX\n\n\u03b1\nm\u03b1 \u03bd\u0304\u03b1L \u03bdBR\n(y\n\n= 0) +\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nZ\n\ndy\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03bd\u0304BL\n\u22025 \u03bdBR\n\n\u0015\n\n+ h.c. .\n\n(16)\n\nThis reduces the problem to a consideration of three KK towers mixing with three neutrinos\nwhich are related to the weak interaction eigenstates by the unitary matrix U defined above.\nEach tower is characterized by its \u03be\u03b1 parameter defined in analogy with section II as \u03be\u03b1 \u2261\n\u221a\n2m\u03b1 R. After diagonalization of the mass matrices in each tower, each standard neutrino\ncan be written as a coherent superposition of the three different towers of mass eigenstates:\n\u03bda =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nUa\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 =\n\n3 X\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b1=1 k=0\n\nUa\u03b1\n\n1\n\u03bd\u0303\u03b1k .\nN\u03b1k\n\n(17)\n\nThis expression generalizes Eq. (7). It is now clear that the three flavour oscillations will\ncorrespond to the oscillations among the three towers. In this regards, the explanation to\nneutrino puzzles is not any more described in terms of three single neutrinos, as in the usual\n8\n\n\fcase; instead all the KK modes can contribute (unless all the KK excitations decouple from\nthe spectrum).\nTo proceed further, let us define the partial transition probabilities\np\u03b1\u03b2 (L) \u2261 h\u03bd\u03b1 (L)|\u03bd\u03b1 (0)ih\u03bd\u03b2 (L)|\u03bd\u03b2 (0)i.\n\n(18)\n\nNotice that the diagonal component p\u03b1\u03b1 may be interpreted as the survival probability of\n\u03bd\u03b1 , and it takes the form of Eqs. (9) and (12) in that case. It of course involves the \u03bd\u03b1 's and\nnot the flavor eigenstates as is obvious. The transition probability among standard flavours\ncan be written in terms of the p\u03b1\u03b2 's as\nPab =\n\nX\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nUa\u03b1\nUb\u03b1 Ub\u03b2\nUa\u03b2 p\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(19)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\nNeglecting all CP phases we may expand Eq. (18) to the form\np\u03b1\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nsin2\n\nk,n=0\n\n\u0010\n\nz\n(\u03bb2\u03b1n\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03bb2\u03b2k )\n\n2 (\u03be )N 2 (\u03be )\nN\u03b1n\n\u03b1\n\u03b2k \u03b2\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nNow, we are ready to address the oscillation problem. Our approach will be as follows:\nwe will first select the parameter range that provides overall reduction required to explain\nthe solar and atmospheric data, and then ask whether for the same range of parameters we\ncan explain the observed oscillation between \u03bd\u0304\u03bc to \u03bd\u0304e reported by LSND. Without loss of\ngenerality, we can assume the hierarchy \u03be1 < \u03be2 < \u03be3 . We consider three possible scenarios:\n(i) \u03be1,2,3 \u226a 1;\n(ii) \u03be1,2 \u226a 1 \u2264 \u03be3 and\n(iii) \u03be1 \u226a 1 \u2264 \u03be2,3 .\nThe case where all \u03bea > 1 is already ruled out since, as we discussed earlier, it cannot\nexplain the solar neutrino data without implying that the extra dimensions be too large. We\ntherefore do not discuss this case. In the discussion of our results, the following expressions\nfor the partial transition probabilities will be very useful: If \u03be\u03b1,\u03b2 \u226a 1, then\np\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nL\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\ncos\n\u2206m\n+\n\u03be\n+\n\u03be\nc(z)\n+\n\u03be\n\u03be\nc\n(z)\n+\ns\n(z)\n,\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b7\u03b12 \u03b7\u03b22\n2E\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n(21)\n\nwith \u2206m2\u03b1\u03b2 = m2\u03b1 \u2212 m2\u03b2 ; \u03b7\u03b12 = 1 + \u03c0 2 \u03be\u03b12 /6 and z = L/2ER2 as before, and where we have\nintroduced the functions\nc(z)\ns(z)\n\n!\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n=\n2\nn=1 n\n\ncos(zn2 )\nsin(zn2 )\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nIt is simple to check that the diagonal term of Eq. (21) reduces to Eq. (9). For \u03be\u03b1 \u226a 1 < \u03be\u03b2\nwe get\np\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u03be\u03b12\n1\n= 2 c\u03b2 (z) + 2 (c(z) c\u03b2 (z) + s(z) s\u03b2 (z)) ;\n\u03b7\u03b1\n\u03b7\u03b1\n9\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhere we now used c\u03b2\u221a(z) = cos(\u03b6\u03b22 )\u03c1(\u03b6\u03b2 ) \u2212 sin(\u03b6\u03b22 )\u03b8(\u03b6\u03b2 ) and s\u03b2 (z) = sin(\u03b6\u03b22)\u03c1(\u03b6\u03b2 ) +\ncos(\u03b6\u03b22)\u03b8(\u03b6\u03b2 ) with \u03b6\u03b2 = z\u03c0\u03be\u03b22 /2, and \u03c1 and \u03b8 as defined in the previous section, we should\nstress that all those functions have a similar deep behaviour. And, finally, for \u03be\u03b1,\u03b2 > 1 we\nhave\np\u03b1\u03b2 = c\u03b1 (z) c\u03b2 (z) + s\u03b1 (z) s\u03b2 (z).\n\n(24)\n\nAgain, it is straightforward to check that the diagonal component of this equation reduces\nto Eq.(12).\nA. Case I: \u03be\u03b1 \u226a 1\n\nSubstituting Eq. (21) into (19), we get, to leading order in \u03be\u03b1\nPab = \u03b4ab \u2212 2\n\nX\n\nUa\u03b1 Ub\u03b1 Ub\u03b2 Ua\u03b2 sin\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nL\n\u2206m2\u03b1\u03b2 + O(\u03be\u03b12 ).\n4E\n\u0013\n\n(25)\n\nTherefore, as expected, to this order, we obtain the standard expression for the transition\nprobability well known for the three neutrino case. It is clear that in this scenario, solar\nand atmospheric data can be explained as in the usual three flavour neutrino models by\nadjusting the spacing of the different \u03be\u03b1 's. For the solar neutrino puzzle, one may either use\nMSW or VO solution depending on how much fine tuning one is willing to tolerate.\nFor intermediate values where L/4E \u226a 1/\u2206m2\u03b1\u03b2 , the leading corrections in \u03be become\nimportant. Expanding Pab up to order \u03be 4 , by introducing Eq. (21) and neglecting the\nstandard oscillatory term we found\n\"\n\nPab \u2248 \u03b4ab 1 \u2212 2\n\n\u03be2\n|Ua\u03b1 |2 \u03b12\n\u03b7\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nX\n\n\u03c02\n\u2212 c(z)\n6\n\n!#\n\n+\n\nX\n\nUa\u03b1 Ub\u03b1 \u03be\u03b12\n\n\u03b1\n\n!2\n\nI(z);\n\n(26)\n\nwhere we have denoted\n\u03c02\n\u03c04\n+ c2 (z) + s2 (z) \u2212 c(z) ,\nI(z) =\n36\n3\n#\n\n\"\n\n(27)\n\nNotice that the first term between parenthesis on Eq. (26) contains the lower order correction\nto the standard survival probability in Eq. (25), while the second term, of oder \u03be\u03b14 will be\nonly relevant for flavour transitions. Taking the average on the last equations, and using\nthat c\u0304 = 0 and c2 + s2 = \u03c0 4 /90, we get\nP\u0304ab \u2248 \u03b4ab\n\n2\n\u03c02 X\n2 \u03be\u03b1\n1\u2212\n|Ua\u03b1 | 2\n3 \u03b1\n\u03b7\u03b1\n\n!\n\n7 4 X\n+\n\u03c0\nUa\u03b1 Ub\u03b1 \u03be\u03b12\n180\n\u03b1\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\nThis last expression generalizes that presented in Ref. [11], where only the contribution of\n\u03be3 was assumed.\nIt is clear that understanding LSND results in this case would require that \u03bd\u03bc first undergo\na transition to the lower KK modes of the bulk neutrinos and then back to the \u03bde . One\nmight hope that if we adjusted the extra dimension radius to be small enough R\u22121 \u223c 0.2 \u2212 2\n10\n\n\feV, then one would get the right mass difference to fit LSND data. The key question then\nis to see whether the transition rate comes out right. For this purpose, we consider up to\nthe lowest non-vanishing order in \u03be\u03b1 for P\u03bce given in (26), which after using the unitarity of\nU and the fact that \u03be32 \u2212 \u03be12 = 2\u2206m2atm R2 turns out to have the form\nP\u03bce \u2248 sin2 2\u03b8\u03bce\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2206m2atm R2\n\n\u00112\n\nI(z)\n\n(29)\n\nwith sin2 2\u03b8\u03bce \u2261 4(U\u03bc3 Ue3 )2 . It is straightforward to check that P\u03bce (L = 0) = 0 by using\nthe identities c(0) = \u03c0 2 /6 and s(0) = 0. From the limits obtained by the CHOOZ and\nPalo Verde collaboration, we know that |Ue3 |2 < 0.03 [15], and assuming |U\u03bc3 |2 = 0.5 for\nmaximal mixing, the largest optimistic value for the mixing angle we may take is about\nsin2 2\u03b8\u03bce = 0.06. By fixing L/E as for LSND, I(z) becomes only a function of R (since\nz = L/2ER2 ). In figure 7 we have plotted I(R) versus R. From this figure we see that for\na reasonable large R (\u223c 10 eV \u22121 ), the function I(R) has very small values already. The\ncombined effect with the factor \u2206m2atm R2 < 1 will reduce P\u03bce even more. Clearly, P\u03bce will\nbe maximal for the larger possible value of R. However, the largest\nallowed radius that\nq\npermit us to still be confident in our approach is about 1/R \u223c \u2206m2atm \u223c 0.06 eV . A\nnumerical calculation with these inputs gives for LSND P\u03bce = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 , which is one order\nof magnitude smaller than the observed anomaly in the \u03bd\u0304 beam of LSND. Since higher order\ncorrections in \u03be\u03b1 to the probability are unlikely to introduce enough enhancement (a factor\nof 10 is needed), we conclude that this scenario yields a too small probability for \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bde\ntransition to explain the LSND observations.\nB. Case II: \u03be1,2 \u226a 1 \u2264 \u03be3\n\nTo proceed with this case, it is convenient to write the survival probability Paa in the\nfollowing form:\nPaa =\n\nX\n\n2\n(Ua\u03b1 Ua\u03b2 )2 p\u03b1\u03b2 + 2Ua3\n\nX\n\n2\n4\nUa\u03b1\np\u03b13 + Ua3\np33 .\n\n(30)\n\n\u03b1=1,2\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=1,2\n\nThe first term in the above equation can be written to leading order in the small \u03be's as\nfollows:\nX\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=1,2\n\n\u0010\n\n2\n(Ua\u03b1 Ua\u03b2 )2 p\u03b1\u03b2 \u2248 1 \u2212 Ua3\n\n\u00112\n\n\u2212 sin2 2\u03b8aa sin2\n\n\u0012\n\nL\n\u2206m221\n4E\n\n\u0013\n\n+ O(\u03be 2)\n\n(31)\n\nwhere sin2 2\u03b8aa = 4(Ua1 Ua2 )2 . This term by itself can explain the solar neutrino deficit.\nClearly, the standard two neutrino oscillation expression is recovered to this order if we\nset Ue3 \u223c 0 to satisfy the bounds imposed by the reactor data [15]. This will make the\ncontributions of the last two terms in the survival probability (30) negligible and the first\noscillatory term can then be used to solve the solar neutrino puzzle. One can of course use\nthe MSW mechanism to solve the solar neutrino problem or the vacuum oscillation. The\nconstraint on the parameter space is that the \u2206m212 be appropriately adjusted. This does\nnot impose any condition on the bulk radius and can be satisfied by the initial choice of\nparameters (the Yukawa couplings) in the theory. For instance, M \u2217 \u223c 10 TeV can lead to\n11\n\n\fthe MSW-type mass differences. Let us note that, if \u2206m212 \u223c 10\u22125 eV2 , then, we will have\n|\u03be12 \u2212 \u03be22 | \u223c 10\u22125 R2 (eV cm)2 .\nNow let us consider P\u03bc\u03bc . From Eq (30), we see that there are several contributions to the\natmospheric neutrino deficit. First, there is the contribution of the towers labeled by \u03be1,2 ,\nwhich is oscillatory, although it can not be identified as in the usual \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations.\nThen, there is also the contribution induced by the term p33 which is of the form of (12).\nFinally, there is also a mixed term, p\u03b13 .\nTo proceed with the full discussion, let us consider two cases:\nCase (i): U\u03bc3 = 0\nIf U\u03bc3 = 0, the last two contributions are removed and we get the survival probability\nP\u03bc\u03bc \u2248 1 \u2212 4\n\n\u0010\n\n2\n2U\u03bc2\n\u2206m221 R2\n\n+\n\n\u03be12\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c02\n\u2212 c(z)\n6\n\n!\n\n(32)\n\nOne might then hope that the oscillations into the lower KK\nq modes with mass differences\nof about 1/R will do the job provided we choose 1/R \u223c \u2206m2atm to match the data. In\nthis case, the atmospheric muon neutrinos oscillate into the sterile neutrinos, a possibility\nwhich has its characteristic tests2 . For this solution to work, one needs to assume \u03be1 \u223c 1\nso that one gets maximal mixing. This in turn means that, to explain both solar and\natmospheric neutrino data, an almost degeneracy \u03be1 \u223c \u03be2 must be maintained. This alters\nour explanation of the solar neutrino deficit since, now, these new contribution to it (see\nthe O(\u03be 2) terms in Eq. (28)), become more and more important and in fact of order one,\nmaking it hard to understand the solar neutrino deficit, since c(z) \u223c 1. We will, therefore,\nconsider this case as an unfavorable one for understanding the neutrino puzzles.\nCase (ii): U\u03bc3 6= 0\nTurning to the case where U\u03bc3 6= 0, if we keep \u03be1,2 \u226a 1 (to maintain our understanding\n2\nof the solar neutrino data) then, the corrections of order \u03be1,2\nto the transition probability\nbecome almost negligible and the dominant contribution to Pab then must come from \u03be3\ncorrections. This yields\nL\nPab \u2248 (\u03b4ab \u2212 Ua3 Ub3 ) \u2212 4(Ua1 Ub2 ) sin\n\u2206m221\n4E\n+2Ua3 Ub3 (\u03b4ab \u2212 Ua3 Ub3 ) c3 (z) + (Ua3 Ub3 )2 p33 .\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(33)\n\nNotice that p33 in the last equation has the same form as Eq. (12), and the function c3 is\nthe one defined above with the same sharp behaviour as p33 . Then specializing Eq. (33) to\nthe \u03bd\u03bc in the atmospheric case, we get\n\u0010\n\n2\nP\u03bc\u03bc \u2248 1 \u2212 U\u03bc3\n\n\u00112\n\n2\n2\n4\n+ 2U\u03bc3\n(1 \u2212 U\u03bc3\n) c3 (z) + U\u03bc3\np33 .\n\n(34)\n\nFrom our naive analysis in the previous section we may expect that this equation can account\nfor the atmospheric data without too much trouble as long as \u03be32 /R \u223c 10\u22122 eV or so to\n2 We\n\nrealize that from an experimental point of view, this looks less likely to be realized in\nnature [16]; we take a somewhat liberal view of the situation and still contemplate this as a viable\npossibility.\n\n12\n\n\fmake the width of the slope larger than the experimental parameters and to avoid the over\nwashing of the \u03bd\u03bc flux. Indeed, it has been checked numerically in reference [11] that the\n2\natmospheric neutrino data can be fitted in this case if U\u03bc3\n\u2248 0.4 and \u03be32 /R \u223c 0.02 eV . It is\nworth mentioning that a mixed explanation could be also possible, where the three towers\ncontribute equally to provide atmospheric oscillations, but we will not discuss this case here.\nAn important point to note however is that due to the features of the function c3 (z), the\natmospheric neutrino data will not exhibit the oscillatory behaviour that one would expect\nin the conventional two neutrino models.\nLets turn now to LSND results. By taking that Ue3 \u223c 0 as suggested by solar neutrino\nP\nand reactor data [15], the transition probability reduces to P\u03bce = \u03b1,\u03b2=1,2 U\u03bc\u03b1 Ue\u03b1 U\u03bc\u03b2 Ue\u03b2 p\u03b1\u03b2 .\nThis reflects the fact that the same argument that suppresses the contribution of the third\nKK tower to Pee also does the same for P\u03bce . As Ue3 = 0 remove the contributions of the\nthird tower, we may expand P\u03bce to the lowest order by the same expression (26) used in the\nprevious case, which is now given as\nP\u03bce \u2248 sin2 2\u03b8\u03bce\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2206m2sol R2\n\n\u00112\n\nI(z)\n\n(35)\n\nwhere now sin2 2\u03b8\u03bce = 4(U\u03bc2 Ue2 )2 , and I(z) as given in Eq. (27). This resembles our former\nexpression in (29). In order to estimate the magnitude of this contribution, note that the\natmospheric neutrino fitting requires \u03be32/R \u223c 10\u22122 eV. For \u03be32 \u223c 1 \u2212 10, this implies that\nR2 \u223c 104 \u2212106 eV\u22122 . Thus if \u2206m2sol corresponds to the MSW solution (large or small angle),\nthen \u2206m2sol R2 \u2243 1 and one obtains P\u03bce = sin2 2\u03b8\u03bce I(z). From Fig. 7, we see again that for\nrelevant values of R and L/E, the function I(z) takes very small values (\u223c 10\u22124 ), making\nthe Pe\u03bc very small.\nNotice that this argument is independent of the way we get the atmospheric deficit. We\ncould also imagine, for instance, that a small value of Ue3 is allowed, and then calculate\nthe leading correction to the above expression. However, it turns out to be of the form\nP\n2\n(U\u03bc3 Ue3 ) \u03b1=1,2 U\u03bc\u03b1 Ue\u03b1 \u03be\u03b12 (c(z) \u2212 \u03c06 ), where last term between parenthesis is already smaller\nthan 10\u22124 by itself.\nC. Case III: \u03be1 \u226a 1 \u2264 \u03be2,3\n\nIn this case, the transition probability can be written as\nPab = (Ua1 Ub1 )2 p11 + 2Ua1 Ub1\n\nX\n\nUa\u03b1 Ub\u03b1 p\u03b11 +\n\n\u03b1=2,3\n\nX\n\nUa\u03b1 Ub\u03b1 Ub\u03b2 Ua\u03b2 p\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(36)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=2,3\n\nThe simplest possibility is to let the first term in above equation is be responsible for solar\nneutrino oscillations into bulk neutrinos as explained by Eq. (9) [10]. This requires that the\nradius be fixed to be about 1/R \u223c 10\u22123 eV . In this case, to keep the \u03bde from mixing too\nmuch with the other neutrinos and generate further reduction of the survival probability for\nthe solar neutrino, we choose Ue1 \u223c 1. This essentially decouples the first tower from the\nothers. As a simple approximation, if we assume that Ue,2,3 = 0, then clearly this suppresses\nthe oscillations from \u03bd\u03bc into \u03bde , making it difficult to understand the LSND results.\nMoreover, in this scenario, even the explanation for atmospheric data seems to run into\nsome trouble. As Ue1 \u223c 1, it is not unreasonable to conclude based on orthogonality that\nU\u03bc1 \u223c 0. This implies that\n13\n\n\fP\u03bc\u03bc =\n\nX\n\n(U\u03bc\u03b1 U\u03bc\u03b2 )2 p\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(37)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=2,3\n\nwhere all p\u03b1\u03b2 are given as in Eq. (24). As a rough approximation, if we assume that\nthe partial transition probabilities are all almost of the same order (as they seem to be\nnumerically), say p33 , and use orthogonality once more to get P\u03bc\u03bc \u2248 p33 . Therefore, we\nget maximal contribution from the large deficit generated by p33 . A hierarchical p\u03b1\u03b2 will\nnot help with this, since either we get equal mixing among them or one of them has a\ndominant contribution. In any case, the leading order will combine both things, a large and\nfast developing slope, and a large mixing angle. Nevertheless, based on the results of [11],\nwhere they found some scenarios where those two ingredients come together (although for\nsmall \u03be), it is still hard to rule out the scenario without a careful numerical analysis of the\ndata. In any case, the simplest requirement to get a deficit not too large compared with the\n2\nexperimental data, imposes a tuning of the main parameters \u03be2,3\n/R \u223c 10\u22122 , which combined\n2\nwith the condition for R to understand the solar neutrino data fixes \u03be2,3\n\u223c 10.\nIn order to understand the LSND results, we must allow for small Ue2 and/or U\u03bc1 . Since,\nin the present scenario, the solar neutrino deficit is being explained purely by oscillation\ninto the bulk, so, we get the following picture: The first tower contributions are too small\nfor LSND, they are even smaller than the size of those considered on the previous cases,\nwhile the oscillations involving the other towers are mainly destructive due to large values\nof \u03be involved. The conversion will not occur but for a small contribution related with the\nsmall part of those towers contained in \u03bde . However, as one may suspect, the contributions\nare all proportional to the mixing angles (U\u03bc\u03b1 Ue\u03b1 )2 , which can not be larger than 10\u22122 . So,\nthe question is whether the behaviour of p\u03b1\u03b2 can help. To analyze this point we notice that\nP\u03bce \u2248\n\nX\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=2,3\n\nU\u03bc\u03b1 Ue\u03b1 Ue\u03b2 U\u03bc\u03b2 (1 \u2212 p\u03b1\u03b2 ).\n\n(38)\n\nNote that one can estimate the value of (1 \u2212 p\u03b1\u03b2 ) from the the information on atmospheric\nneutrino deficit as follows. First point is that all p\u03b1\u03b2 's are of same order and therefore,\none can write the P\u03bce \u2248 (U\u03bc1 Ue1 )2 (1 \u2212 Psurv ), where Psurv (\u03b6) is the same function which\nfor \u03b6 = \u03b6atmos gives the survival probability of muon neutrinos in the atmospheric data.\nThus, Psurv (\u03b6atm ) \u2248 0.5. The value of \u03b6 corresponding to the LSND case is however much\nsmaller due to smaller oscillation distance; therefore to estimate P\u03bce we must use the value\nof \u03b6 which is much smaller and find the corresponding Psurv . A numerical evaluation gives\n(1 \u2212 Psurv ) \u223c 10\u22122 . The next question is how large the mixing parameters are. In order\nnot to make Pee in atmospheric neutrino data different from one, U\u03bc2 must be much smaller\nthan 1. On the other hand to fit LSND observations, we need to have U\u03bc1 \u223c 0.5. It therefore\nappears difficult to accommodate the LSND observations in this case.\nIV. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe analysis of the present paper shows that in minimal models for neutrino masses in\ntheories with large extra dimensions, it is not possible to get a simultaneous explanation of\ngross overall oscillations needed to understand the solar, atmospheric and the LSND data.\nFitting the overall deficit in the atmospheric and solar neutrino data for various ranges of\n14\n\n\fthe input parameters, the largest conversion probability, P\u03bce , that we find, is around 10\u22124 .\nThis is too low to explain the LSND observations. One must therefore invoke new physics\nbeyond the standard model in the brane [8,17] or new physics outside the brane [14] for a\nsimultaneous understanding of all observed neutrino data.\nThe oscillation pattern is governed by the dimensionless parameters \u03be\u03b1 . Three of them\narise in the models under consideration and we get the following picture:\n(i) \u03be1,2,3 \u226a 1: in this case, solar and atmospheric neutrino data are understood as in the\ncase of four dimensional models and the hope that the presence of the bulk neutrinos\nwith an appropriate KK excitation scale could provide an understanding of the LSND\ndata is not realized.\n(ii) \u03be1,2 \u226a 1 \u2264 \u03be3 : solar neutrino data is provided as in the four dimensional models but\natmospheric data is explained by \u03bd\u03bc to \u03bdbulk oscillation onceqthe appropriate values of\nthe bulk radius is chosen i.e. either \u03be1 \u2248 \u03be2 and 1/R \u223c \u2206m2atm or \u03be32 /R \u223c 10\u22122 .\nIn this case, the atmospheric neutrino flux does not oscillate as a function of L/E, a\nfeature distinct from the conventional two neutrino oscillation picture.\n(iii) \u03be1 \u226a 1 \u2264 \u03be2,3 . Both, solar and atmospheric data are explained by \u03bd \u2192 \u03bdbulk oscilla2\ntions. Therefore 1/R2 \u223c \u2206m2sol \u223c 10\u22123 eV with matter effects for solar and \u03be2,3\n\u223c 10.\nAgain, the L/E behaviour of the atmospheric flux is not oscillatory.\n(iv) \u03be1,2,3 \u226b 1. There is no explanation for solar neutrino data in this case. This parameter\nrange is therefore ruled out.\nAcknowledgements.

Mixing factors for the expansion (7) for different values of the parameter \u03be. To\nmake the effect for large \u03be visible we have introduced an arbitrary normalization where N0 = 1.\nThis amplifies the value of 1/Nn by a constant scaling. Of course, the real values satisfy the\nnormalization condition. This figure shows how, for large \u03be, the effective number of KK mass\neigenmodes contributing into the weak eigenstate \u03bdL gets larger and those modes become almost\nequally suppressed, while for small \u03be the lightest mode (n = 0) become the main component, with\nthe decoupling of all other modes.\n\n17\n\n\f1\n\n[ \u0013\u0011\u0014\n\nPQ7Q\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n[ \u0014\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n[ \u0016\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nL / 2ER\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3.
