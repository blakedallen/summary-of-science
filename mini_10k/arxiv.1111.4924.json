Introduction.\nOn Tuesday, August 17th, 1999, at 3:02 a.m. local time, an earthquake of Mw = 7.6 struck the Kocaeli province (near Izmit town)\nof north-western Turkey. The earthquake occurred at the western branch of the 1,500-km-long North Anatolian Fault (NAF) system\nwhich was ruptured at a length of about 110 km. According to official Turkish government estimates, the earthquake caused\n17,127 deaths, 43,953 injuries, more than 250,000 people were displaced and a large number of damages in buildings and large\nscale technical infrastructure.\nDetails for the geological and seismotectonic environment of the regional Western part of the North Anatolian Fault zone, where\nthe EQ occurred, have been presented by many researchers (i.e. Barka 1999; Ferrari et al. 2000; Nalbant et al. 1998; Stein et al.\n1997; Taymaz 1999; USGS 1999). The vast majority of the research literature on this topic is directly (or in a way indirectly)\nseismically oriented.\nIn this work, the Izmit EQ will be studied in a quite different point of view. Its time of occurrence will be correlated to the\nobserved preseismic electric signals, that were generated long before its occurrence time, due to excess strain load at its focal\narea and were recorded by the VOL monitoring site located in Greece at a distance of 650 Km from the EQ epicentral area. The\nlocation of VOL monitoring site and the Izmit EQ are presented in figure (1).\n\nFig. 1. Location of VOL monitoring site (blue\nsolid circle) and the IZMIT EQ (red circles).\nThe thick brown lines represent the deep\nlithospheric fracture zones and faults of the\nGreek territory (Thanassoulas, 2007).\n\n1\n\n\fMoreover, a physical mechanism will be postulated that accounts for the generation of the observed preseismic electric signals\nand the time of occurrence (in short-term mode prediction) of the Izmit EQ.\n\n2. Theoretical analysis - postulated model.\nThe Earth-tides mechanism was early recognized as a potential trigger for the occurrence of strong earthquakes. This\napproach was followed to study the time of occurrence of EQs and their correlation to Earth-tides. Knopoff (1964), Shlien\n(1972), Heaton (1982) and Shirley (1988) suggested the Earth-tides as a triggering mechanism of strong EQs, Yamazaki\n(1965, 1967), Rikitake et al. (1967) studied the oscillatory behaviour of strained rocks, due to Earth-tides, while Ryabl et al.\n(1968), Mohler (1980) and Sounau et al. (1982) correlated Earth-tides to local micro-earthquakes and aftershock sequences.\nThe following figure (2) demonstrates the mechanism which generates the Earth-tides. On the left, the forces are shown\nwhich apply the Moon or the Sun on the Earth's surface and the corresponding generated lithospheric deformation. A\ntypical daily tidal variation is shown on the right.\n\nFig. 2. Left: Forces applied on the Earth's surface (Stacey, 1969) by the Moon or the Sun (left) and the resulted,\nth\ndeformation (Garland, 1971) of the lithospheric plate. Right: Earth-tide calculated for the 18 November, 1997,\n0\n0\nGreece \u03c6 = 38 , \u03bb = 24 . The vertical scale is in mgals, while the horizontal one is in minutes (1 day = 1440\nminutes). In this figure it is possible to identify the K1 (23.93hr), K2 (11.97hr) and S2 (12.00hr) components.\nEarth-tides exhibit an oscillating mode of behaviour. The study of the Earth-tide oscillation has shown that, basically, it\nconsists of the following main components, presented in the table below.\n\nTidal components\nSymbol\n----------M2\nS2\nN2\nK2\nK1\nO1\nP1\nM1\nSsa\n\nName\n----------------Principal Lunar\nPrincipal Solar\nLunar Ellipticity\nLunisolar\nLunisolar\nLunar Declination\nSolar Declination\nMoon declination\nMoon declination\n\nPeriod (hr)\n--------------12.42\n12.00\n12.66\n11.97\n23.93\n25.82\n24.07\n14 days\n6 months\n\nFinally, an Earth-tide wave is generated with a year's period, because of the Earth's motion in an ellipse with the Sun in\nthe focus.\nThe deformation of the lithosphere follows the oscillatory character of the Earth-tides. Garland (1971), Stacey (1969),\nSazhina and Grushinsky (1971), study in detail this type of Earth's oscillation, not to mention the majority of the\nGeophysical textbooks. A detailed presentation of the generation of the normal to the ground oscillatory tidal component\nwas given by Thanassoulas (2007) while a brief presentation (key-drawings) is given below in figure (3).\n\nFig. 3. Left: Lithospheric plate at rest (solid line) and maximum amplitude oscillation (dashed line). Bottom\ndrawing indicates the stress-load, along the plate, during its oscillation. Right: Compressional and\nextensional oscillatory forces (S) are generated in the lithosphere, due to its tidal oscillation (for more\ndetails see: Thanassoulas, 2007).\n\n2\n\n\fThe oscillation of the lithospheric plate, due to Earth-tides, has two severe consequences:\n-The first one is that, at the peak amplitude of its oscillation, when the plate is at nearly critical stress load, it can\nreach the extreme conditions which are necessary for an earthquake to occur (Thanassoulas et al. 2001), provided that,\nthe focal area itself, has been charged, enough, by the linear increase of stress, due to plate's motion. This takes place,\nespecially, when all the oscillating components of the Earth-tides are \"in phase\".\n-The second one is that, at the very same stress load critical conditions, the focal area of an imminent earthquake\ngenerates electrical signals (Thanassoulas 1991, Clint 1999). The latter is due to its large crystal lattice deformation and\ndue to the piezoelectric properties of the quartzite content of the lithosphere. As a consequence, a large scale\npiezoelectric mechanism in the regional seismogenic area can be activated.\nThe type of electric signals, which are expected to be observed after the activation of the piezoelectric mechanism, cover a\nwide frequency spectrum due to the nature of the progressive lithospheric mechanical failure before and during the EQ\noccurrence. Some of these electric signals are of specific earthquake predictive interest.\nThe most well-known electric signal that is generated by piezoelectricity is the one presented in the following figure (4). The\ngenerated by the strained volume electric potential is almost linearly related to the volume strain as long as the applied strain\nlevel exceeds the piezoelectric mechanism activation strain level.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 4. Typical stress \u2013 strain (a) relation of solid material that exhibits piezoelectric-like properties and its\ncorresponding (b) potential \u2013 time relation. It is assumed that positive charges are generated in\ncompression mode.\nAlthough the latter type of electric signal can be quite easily be observed in a laboratory experiment on a rock sample, it is rather\nimpossible to directly observe it in situ on a seismogenic region. The problem is that a seismogenic area cannot be treated as a\nrock sample under laboratory conditions due to its large (in Km) dimensions. This problem can be resolved (Thanassoulas 2007,\n2008) indirectly by integrating along time the registered gradient electric potential data obtained at large distances from the\npiezoelectrically (seismogenic) activated area.\nThe basic piezoelectric mechanism presented in figure (4) gives rise, indirectly, to the following types of signals. Let us use a\nlow-pass potential gradient detecting system. In such a case it is possible to detect the first derivative of the piezoelectric potential\ngenerated over the seismogenic area (fig. 5 left). This is known as the Very Long Period (VLP) electric signal. If instead of a lowpass filter we use a band-pass filter then an oscillating potential (fig. 5 right) will be detected with a period similar to the oscillating\nstress component. A characteristic of this signal is that its amplitude increases as long as the strain increases. The latter is a direct\noutcome of the observed increase of the potential gradient as a function of stress.\n\nFig. 5. Left: First derivative: VLP signals observed through a low-pass filter. Right: Oscillating signal generated due to\noscillating stress component, observed through a band-pass filter (Thanassoulas et al. 1986, 1993).\n\n3\n\n\fThe form of the potential \u2013 strain relation can generate short wave-length, compared to the duration of the piezoelectric activity,\nelectric signals. In figure (6) left, in red circles are presented the two (A, B) non-linear parts of the potential \u2013 strain curve. These\nnon-linear parts generate higher harmonic (compared to the basic one) electric signals. Furthermore, the piezoelectricity can be\nactivated in a varying scale of rock volumes and therefore, short or long wave-length electric pulses can be generated by combining\ncompresional and decompresional piezostimulated currents (Thanassoulas, 2008a). The latter mechanism is shown in figure (6)\nright.\n\nFig. 6. Left: Non-linear areas (A, B) of the piezoelectric potential curve are shown, where electric signals of higher harmonics\ncan be generated. Right: Schematic presentation of the generation of a square electric pulse by the mechanisms of\npiezoelectricity and piezostimulated currents generation. A rock small block / grain (RG) is subjected in (A) stress\nincrease and stress decrease in (B) at step (1). Positive (A) or negative (B) currents generate at step (2) which are\ncombined in step (3) in a short square pulse (SP) of dt duration.\nThe already presented theoretical model will be applied on and tested against the electric potential registered at VOL\nmonitoring site in Greece before the Izmit EQ occurrence time.\n\n3. Data presentation and processing.\nThe electrical potential as a function of time, which was recorded at Volos (VOL ) monitoring site, Greece (Thanassoulas\nth\net al. 2000) and includes the Izmit, EQ (17 , August, 1999, M=7.6) occurrence time, is shown in the following figure (7).\nth\nth\nFigure (7) spans from June 20 to August 30 , 1999. The recorded potential is the gradient in time of the generated by the\npiezoelectric mechanism total electric field (Thanassoulas 2007). The red horizontal bar represents the most \"noisy\" part of the\nrecording while the vertical red bar indicates the occurrence time of the Izmit EQ.\n\nth\n\nth\n\nFig. 7. Gradient in time of the piezoelectric potential (June 20 to August 30 , 1999) generated by\nthe activation of the piezoelectric mechanism in the seismogenic region of the Izmit EQ.\nThe most \"noisy\" part of it is indicated by a horizontal red bar while the Izmit EQ\noccurrence time is indicated by a vertical red bar.\nAt a first glance it is evident that outstanding electric noise was generated for about a month before the EQ occurrence time. It\nis clear that the specific noise vanished shortly after the EQ occurrence.\nThe potential gradient data can be integrated along time in order to obtain the original piezoelectric field form generated in the\nfocal area as a function of time (Thanassoulas 2007). The result of this transformation is shown in the following figure (8). At left\n(a) the resulted potential is presented while the red vertical bar indicates the EQ occurrence time. In the middle (b) the\ncharacteristic strain \u2013 stress function is presented while at right (c) the corresponding generated potential as a function of time\ndue to (b) is presented. Following the basic laws of rock mechanics the rock formation will collapse closely to the upper nonlinear part of (b) which corresponds to the upper part of (c). The figure (8, a) shows exactly that mechanism. The rock formation\nfailure (EQ) took place at the upper part of figure (a) when it had reached very closely its fracture strain level suggested indirectly\nby the form, obtained by integration of the gradient data, of the piezoelectric potential.\n\n4\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 8. Potential (a) generated by the EQ focal area, compared to the theoretical piezoelectric model (c) and\nthe triggering stress inducing mechanism (b). Time duration of (a) is 35 days.\nFollowing the presented model of figure (5, left) the gradient data were low-pass filtered in an attempt to identify the VLP\npiezoelectric signals which correspond to its first derivative in time. The results of that operation are presented in the following\nfigure (9). A characteristic VLP (first derivative of the piezoelectric potential) signal that lasts for 20 days is clearly present that\ndeviates from the background reference level.\n\nFig. 9. VLP / first derivative of the piezoelectric potential identified after low-pass filtering of the\nraw data. The graph spans from 26/7/ to 23/8/1999 (20days). The brown horizontal line\nrepresents the background reference level while the red vertical bar indicates the\noccurrence time of the EQ.\nIt is characteristic that the EQ did occur almost at the end of that VLP signal conforming to the mechanism presented in figure\n(5, left) that suggests the occurrence of the rock formation fracture in the very near future.\nIf instead of using a low-pass filter we use a band-pass filter and select the pass band to be equal to 1 day, then it is possible to\nidentify, due to the activation of the piezoelectric mechanism, the oscillating components of the earth's electric field which has\nbeen triggered by the tidally oscillating stress component (K1, P1) applied on the already highly strained seismogenic region\n(Thanassoulas et al. 1986, 1993). The latter is presented in the following figure (10). The figure (10) spans for the same period of\ntime as the figure (9). It is very interesting to observe that the oscillating signal duration of figure (10) is almost the same as the\nVLP signal of figure (9). It is quite close to what is theoretically expected from figure (5, right). The piezoelectric mechanism\njustifies the simultaneous presence of the first derivative VLP signal and the oscillating one, since these are generated from the\nsame part of the piezoelectric potential curve.\n\nFig. 10. Oscillating piezoelectric signal that spans from 26/7 to 23/8/1999. The signal lasts for 15\ndays and coincides quite well with the VLP of figure (9). The red vertical bar indicates the\noccurrence time of the EQ.\nA smaller part of figure (10) of a few days is enlarged in order to compare the exact EQ occurrence time to the one of the\namplitude peak of the oscillating electric field (Thanassoulas et al. 2011a). The enlarged graph is presented in figure (11).\n\n5\n\n\fth\n\nth\n\nFig. 11. Enlarged part of figure (10). The recording spans from August 11 to August 18 1999.\nThe EQ occurred 1hour and 22minutes before the closest electric field oscillation peak\n(Thanassoulas et al. 2011a).\nSo far, it has been demonstrated that preseismic electric signals of large periods (some hours \u2013 days) were generated before\nthe Izmit EQ occurrence time by a hypothesized piezoelectric mechanism that was triggered at the seismogenic area.\nFurthermore, the very same mechanism justifies the generation of electric signals of frequencies ranging from KHz to MHz\n(Eftaxias et al. 2009). These high frequency electric signals can be generated at areas (A) and (B) of figure (6) left where rock\nfracturing is initiated. Therefore, due to the fact that an earthquake is the result of a gradual collapse of a rock formation, that\nevolves from small scale to large scale faulting, it is evident that during small scale fracturing high frequency EM waves can be\ngenerated. For the present case of the Izmit EQ that type of electric signals cannot be observed in the raw data recordings\nbecause the frequency response of the monitoring system is designed so that it rejects signals in the range of KHz, ULF, MHz.\nHowever, signals of larger period than a couple of minutes that are generated by the mechanism presented in figure (6, right), are\nclearly recorded. Some samples of that type of signals that preceded the Izmit EQ are presented in the following figures (12, 13,\nand 14).\n\nFig. 12. Preseismic electric signal recorded at VOL monitoring site on 10/7/1999\n\nFig. 13. Preseismic electric signal recorded at VOL monitoring site on 27/7/1999\n\nFig. 14. Preseismic electric signal recorded at VOL monitoring site on 14/8/1999\nThe type of signals presented in figures (12, 13, and 14) was observed right from the start (20/6/1999) of the operation of the\n\nVOL monitoring site in digital mode. Therefore, we must accept that such signals were generated at the seismogenic region a few\nmonths before the Izmit EQ occurrence time.\nOnce the seismogenic area released its strain load through the Izmit EQ, it is expected that the piezoelectric signals should\ndisappear. This is demonstrated in the following figures (15, 16).\n\n6\n\n\fFig. 15. Earth's electric potential recorded at VOL monitoring site from 31/8 to 3/9/1999\n\nFig. 16. Earth's electric potential recorded at VOL monitoring site from 22/12 to 25/12/1999\nThe absence of preseismic electric signals in both figures (15, 16) is very clear comparing to the figures (12, 13, and 14).\n\n4. Discussion \u2013 Conclusions.\nSo far, all the theoretically expected electric signals that should be generated by a hypothetically triggered large scale piezoelectric\nmechanism in the focal area have been identified in or obtained from after processing the raw data of the VOL monitoring site\nrecordings of the Earth's electric field. Therefore, it is justified to accept that the main physical mechanism that was triggered in the\nIzmit seismogenic region is the piezoelectric one.\nDuring a six months period of recording of the Earth's electric field, only the NS component was recorded by VOL\nmonitoring site. The following figure (17) corresponds to the recording day on 22/07/99. This recording was performed almost\none month before the large Izmit, (17/8/1999, M=7.6) earthquake in Turkey and is more or less characteristic for the preearthquake recording period.\n\nFig. 17. Preseismic electric signal recorded at VOL monitoring site on 22/7/1999\nAn interesting feature of these signals is that, the start time of these signals coincides with two specific daytimes. The first one is\naround 9 a.m, while the second one is around 21.5 p.m. This observation was studied, in detail, by separating the\"9.0 a.m\" signals and\nthe \"21.5 p.m\" signals in two groups (signal A, signal B). The following figure (18) represents the existence of electrical signals (signal\nA) as a function of time (in days), while the vertical axis represents the start-up time of each signal (in minutes) in the span of the day\nof its occurrence. In the horizontal axis of time, the earthquakes in Izmit, Athens and Duzce are marked with a red arrow.\n\nFig. 18. Daily presence of signals ( A) is shown, for the period of time 20/06 \u2013 31/12/1999.\n\n7\n\n\fIn the following figure (19), the signals (B) are presented with the same annotation.\n\nFig. 19. Daily presence of signals (B) is shown, for the period of time 20/06 \u2013 31/12/1999.\nWhat is clear, from both figures, is the drastic decrease of the presence of the signals after the occurrence of Izmit EQ. On\nthe other hand, before Duzce EQ, of a similar magnitude to Izmit EQ, no such signals were observed. This suggests that Izmit \u2013\nDuzce regions may be considered as a unit seismogenic area, stress loaded and seismically activated. Consequently, the\ngenerated, electrical signals were produced by the entire, seismically active area and not only by the Izmit focal region. This is\ncorroborated from the fact that Izmit \u2013 Duzce distance is of the order of 80Km (see fig. 20) which coincides quite well with the\nexpected fracture length of the seismogenic fault, which is what is more or less expected for an EQ of M = 7.6.\n\nFig. 20. Izmit - Duzce location (red concentric circles) in relation to the VOL monitoring site in Greece.\nTherefore, when most of the stress-load of the entire seismogenic area had been released (by Izmit EQ), the rest of it was not\ncapable of generating similar electrical signals. Viewing this pair of strong EQs from the point of view of electrical signals\ngeneration mechanism, it is characterized as a very interesting and spectacular, seismic event.\nFor both signals ( A, B) the mean starting time has been calculated. For signals ( A) the mean value (MV A) was calculated as\n569 minutes.\nMV A = 569 minutes\nThis corresponds to a mean starting time of 9hr 29 minutes. For signals ( B), the same calculation results in a (MVB) of 1257\nminutes. This corresponds to a mean starting time of 20hr 57 minutes.\n\n8\n\n\fMVB = 1257 minutes\nFinally, the mean time difference in time of occurrence of the electrical signals has been calculated, as:\n\nMVB - MV A = 11hr 28 minutes.\nComparing this result to the Earth-tide components, its very close resemblance is revealed to (K2) (lunisolar) and (S2 )\n(principal solar) components. A discrepancy of 4.17% has been calculated for the ( K2) component, while a value of 4.4%\ncorresponds to the (S2) one. The satisfactory results fit what was expected from the earlier theoretical analysis.\nIn simple words, the entire Izmit - Duzce seismogenic area was loaded at a such critical point of stress-strain charged\nconditions, so that it generated SES twice in a day, at both the amplitude peaks of the 24 hours lithospheric oscillation.\nSince the lithosphere was set to a tidally triggered critical oscillating mode, it is justified to adopt the idea that other tidal\ncomponents contributed to the triggering of the Izmit EQ. Therefore, the M1 (Moon declination) tidal component that is\ncalculated for the Izmit epicentre area is compared to the time of the EQ occurrence and presented in the following figure (21).\n\nFig. 21. Comparison of the Izmit EQ (17/8/1999) occurrence time (red bar) to the M1 (Moon\ndeclination, black line) tidal component. The observed deviation dt of the occurrence\ntime to the corresponding tidal amplitude peak is: dt = 1.5 days.\nThe Izmit EQ did not release the stress load that had been accumulated in the regional seismogenic area. Therefore, on\n12/11/1999, another large EQ of Mw = 7.2 occurred, at 80 km eastern from Izmit, at Duzce area. That EQ is compared to the M1\ntidal component too. The following figure (22) shows this comparison.\n\nFig. 22. Comparison of the Duzce EQ (12/11/1999) occurrence time (red bar) to the M1 (Moon\ndeclination, black line) tidal component. The observed deviation dt of the occurrence\ntime to the corresponding tidal amplitude peak is: dt = 1.2 days.\nIt is made clear from figures (21, 22) that the M1 tidal component is the most probable mechanism that triggered the final\nfracture (EQ generation) of the Izmit - Duzce seismogenic region. The latter triggering mechanism was validated, during the\npreparation of this work, by another large EQ of Mw = 7.3 that did occur at South \u2013 Eastern Turkey on 23/10/11. A similar\ncomparison of the calculated M1 tidal component to the time of the EQ occurrence is presented in the following figure (23).\n\nFig. 23. Comparison of the South \u2013 Eastern Turkey EQ (Mw = 7.3, 23/10/2011) occurrence time (red bar) to\nthe M1 (Moon declination, black line) tidal component. The observed deviation dt of the\noccurrence time to the corresponding tidal amplitude peak is: dt = .57 days.\nThe latter results comply quite well to the conclusions of a global study of large EQs in relation to their local M1 tidal\ncomponent presented very recently by Thanassoulas et al. (2011).\n\n9\n\n\fA question that is obvious, after all that analysis, could be related to the predictability of the Izmit EQ. That is in simple words\nthe possibility to know in advance, the location, time of occurrence and the magnitude of the referred EQ. These predictive\nparameters will be discussed separately each one as follows:\nLocation: In terms of regional seismological conditions what is known is the fact that the North Anatolian Fault (NAF)\nexhibits large seismic events along it, which large seismicity generally presents a west-ward drift. A mean 10-year period\nbetween triggering and subsequent rupturing shocks in the Anatolia sequence has been observed. Furthermore the study of the\nstress changes results in identifying areas (of known faults) of large probability for the occurrence of a large EQ in the next\ndecade. Actually the Izmit regional seismogenic area was characterized by a large probability of 12% for the studied NAF\nsegment (Sapanca fault, Stein et al. 1997). Therefore, the Izmit EQ, of 1999, validated the Stein et al. (1997) analysis. In a recent\nseismological analysis of the same seismic event it is revealed that the earthquake was preceded by a seismic signal of long\nduration that originated from the hypocenter. The signal consisted of a succession of repetitive seismic bursts, accelerating with time,\nand increased low-frequency seismic noise. These observations show that the earthquake was preceded, for 44 minutes, by a phase\nof slow slip occurring at the base of the brittle crust. This slip accelerated slowly initially, and then rapidly accelerated in the 2 minutes\npreceding the earthquake (Bouchon et al. 2011). The latter seismic signal could be considered as a probable short-term seismic\nprecursor since the Izmit regional area was highly stress loaded and consequently that signal was predicting the area to be ruptured\nin the very near future.\nOn the other hand, the recorded in Greece preseismic electric signals cannot provide the future epicentre area for the same\nseismic event due to the fact that triangulation of the Earth's registered electric field requires at least two distant monitoring\nsites (Thanassoulas, 2007).\n\nTime of occurrence: As far as it concerns the time of occurrence of the Izmit EQ, following the Stein et al. (1997) study an\nestimate can be made for a future EQ within the next few years to come after the last NAF rupture that preceded the Izmit EQ.\nThat kind of prediction refers to a medium term one. On the other hand, Bouchon et al. (2011) seismic signal was \"a posteriori\"\nidentified and within a very short time period (44 minutes) before the Izmit EQ occurrence. Therefore, it was \"too short-term\" for\npractical warning purposes in order to avoid people deaths. In order to estimate the time of occurrence of the Izmit EQ the\nregistration of the Earth's electric field combined to the M1 tidal lithospheric oscillation can provide valuable information\nconcerning the future EQ time of occurrence. The postulated methodology is presented in the following figure (23). What is\nreally required is: to identify the last phase of the lithospheric deformation when the rock formation failure will take place and,\nmoreover, during this last phase of deformation, the time of occurrence of the maximum fine stress oscillation (induced by M1 )\nwhich will actually trigger the EQ. The black line represents the generated piezoelectric potential as a function of time. At its\nupper part (right) the potential curve bends thus showing that the seismogenic area is very close to rupturing time. The green\nline represents the M1 tidal component. The red bar indicates the time of occurrence of the Izmit EQ. The coincidence of the\ntime of occurrence of the EQ, with the upper bend of the piezoelectric potential and with the maximum of the lithospheric stress\nload oscillation is pretty obvious.\n\nFig. 23. Correlation of the piezoelectric potential (black line) observed in Greece (VOL monitoring site) before the Izmit EQ\nwith the maximum amplitude (thus maximum stress-load) of the lithospheric oscillation (green line) observed at the\nepicentral area due to the M1 tidal component, and with the time of occurrence (red bar) of the Izmit EQ.\nVery similar results to the ones shown in figure (23) have been presented by Thanassoulas et al. (2008a, 2009, 2010) after\nanalysing the earth's electric field that was registered before the occurrence of some large EQs, in Greece.\n\nMagnitude: During the occurrence of an earthquake the dynamic strain energy that is stored in the seismogenic region is\nreleased as a mechanical kinetic one. The amount of the released energy is expressed by a number that defines the magnitude\nof the seismic event. Consequently, it is possible to know in advance the maximum magnitude of an earthquake that is possible\nto occur at any seismogenic area provided that the stored strain energy has been calculated. Therefore it is required that either\nthe \"Lithospheric Seismic Energy Flow Model LSEFM\" (Thanassoulas, 2007) will be applied on an already known specific\nseismogenic area which is just before failure, or the corresponding regional seismic potential maps are available, compiled\nfrom the past (some years) seismicity and indicate the expected maximum EQ magnitude. For the present case of the Izmit EQ\nnone of the latter could be applied before its occurrence, due to the lack, by that time (1999), of the appropriate methodology\nand the corresponding seismic potential maps.\nIn conclusion, the Izmit EQ, due to its large magnitude and due to the large amplitude generated preseismic electric\nsignals, could have quite accurately been predicted, provided that a widely spread (along NAF) network of monitoring stations\nof the earth's electric field had been deployed well in advance, for continuously monitoring of the Earth's electric field.\n\n5.
