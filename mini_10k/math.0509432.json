Research announcements\n2.1. New reals: Can live with them, can live without them. We give a simple\nproof of the preservation theorem for proper countable support iterations known as\n\"tools-preservation\", \"Case A\" or \"first preservation theorem\" in the literature. We\ndo not assume that the forcings add reals.\nCurrently the paper contains drafts of the proofs only. We will fill in more details\nsoon.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.LO/0505471\nMartin Goldstern and Jakob Kellner\n2.2. Uniform almost everywhere domination. We explore the interaction between Lebesgue measure and dominating functions. We show, via both a priority\nconstruction and a forcing construction, that there is a function of incomplete degree\nthat dominates almost all degrees. This answers a question of Dobrinen and Simpson, who showed that such functions are related to the proof-theoretic strength of the\nregularity of Lebesgue measure for G\u03b4 sets. Our constructions essentially settle the\nreverse mathematical classification of this principle.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.LO/0506019\nPeter Cholak, Joseph Miller, and Noam Greenberg\n2.3. Heredity of \u03c4 -pseudocompactness. S. Garcia-Ferreira and H. Ohta gave a\nconstruction that was intended to produce a tau-pseudocompact space, which has a\nregular-closed zero set A and a regular-closed C-embedded set B such that neither A\nnor B is \u03c4 -pseudocompact. We show that although their sets A, B are not regularclosed, there are at least two ways to make their construction work to give the desired\nexample.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.GN/0505516\nJerry E. Vaughan\n2.4. Understanding preservation theorems: \u03c9 \u03c9 -bounding. This is an expository note giving Shelah's proof of the preservation of \"proper + \u03c9 \u03c9 -bounding\" (Theorem 1.12 of Chapter VI of his book Proper and Improper Forcing).\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.LO/0505645\nChaz Schlindwein\n\n\fSPM BULLETIN 14 (September 2005)\n\n3\n\n2.5. Classification problems in continuum theory. We study several natural\nclasses and relations occurring in continuum theory from the viewpoint of descriptive\nset theory and infinite combinatorics. We provide useful characterizations for the relation of likeness among dendrites and show that it is a bqo with countably many equivalence classes. For dendrites with finitely many branch points the homeomorphism\nand quasi-homeomorphism classes coincide, and the minimal quasi-homeomorphism\nclasses among dendrites with infinitely many branch points are identified. In contrast,\nwe prove that the homeomorphism relation between dendrites is S\u221e -universal. It is\nshown that the classes of trees and graphs are both D2 (\u03a303 )-complete, the class of\ndendrites is \u03a003 -complete, and the class of all continua homeomorphic to a graph or\ndendrite with finitely many branch points is \u03a003 -complete. We also show that if G is\na nondegenerate finitely triangulable continuum, then the class of G-like continua is\n\u03a002 -complete.\nhttp://www.ams.org/journal-getitem?pii=S0002-9947-05-03956-5\nRiccardo Camerlo, Udayan B. Darji, and Alberto Marcone\n2.6. Residuality of families of F\u03c3 sets. We prove that two natural definitions of\nresiduality of families of F\u03c3 sets are equivalent. We make use of the Banach-Mazur\ngame in the proof.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.GN/0506379\nShingo Saito\n2.7. First countable, countably compact spaces and the continuum hypothesis. We build a model of ZFC+CH in which every first countable, countably compact\nspace is either compact or contains a homeomorphic copy of \u03c91 with the order topology. The majority of the paper consists of developing forcing technology that allows\nus to conclude that our iteration adds no reals. Our results generalize Saharon Shelah's iteration theorems appearing in Chapters V and VIII of Proper and improper\nforcing (1998), as well as Eisworth and Roitman's (1999) iteration theorem. We close\nthe paper with a ZFC example (constructed using Shelah's club\u2013guessing sequences)\nthat shows similar results do not hold for closed pre\u2013images of \u03c92 .\nhttp://www.ams.org/journal-getitem?pii=S0002-9947-05-04034-1\nTodd Eisworth and Peter Nyikos\n2.8. Game approach to universally Kuratowski-Ulam spaces. We consider a\nvariant of the open-open game. A topological characterization of I-favorable spaces\nis used to show that the hyperspace over I-favorable space is I-favorable. The main\nresult is that every I-favorable space is universally Kuratowski-Ulam.1\nAndrzej Kucharski and Szymon Plewik\n2.9. Small Valdivia compact spaces. We prove a preservation theorem for the\nclass of Valdivia compact spaces, which involves inverse sequences of \"simple\" retractions. Consequently, a compact space of weight 6 \u05d01 is Valdivia compact iff it is\n1A\n\nspace Y is universally Kuratowski-Ulam if the Kuratowski-Ulam Theorem holds in X \u00d7 Y for\nevery space X.\n\n\f4\n\nSPM BULLETIN 14 (SEPTEMBER 2005)\n\nthe limit of an inverse sequence of metric compacta whose bonding maps are retractions. As a corollary, we show that the class of Valdivia compacta of weight 6 \u05d01\nis preserved both under retractions and under open 0-dimensional images. Finally,\nwe characterize the class of all Valdivia compacta in the language of category theory, which implies that this class is preserved under all continuous weight preserving\nfunctors.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.GN/0507062\nWieslaw Kubi\u015b and Henryk Michalewski\n2.10. Canonical forms of Borel functions on the Milliken space. The goal of\nthis paper is to canonize Borel measurable mappings \u2206 : \u03a9\u03c9 \u2192 R, where \u03a9\u03c9 is the\nMilliken space, i.e., the space of all increasing infinite sequences of pairwise disjoint\nnonempty finite sets of \u03c9. This main result is a common generalization of a theorem\nof Taylor and a theorem of Pr\u00f6mel and Voigt.\nhttp://www.ams.org/journal-getitem?pii=S0002-9947-05-04000-6\nOlaf Klein and Otmar Spinas\n2.11. Complete analytic equivalence relations. We prove that various concrete\nanalytic equivalence relations arising in model theory or analysis are complete, i.e.\nmaximum in the Borel reducibility ordering. The proofs use some general results\nconcerning the wider class of analytic quasi-orders.\nhttp://www.ams.org/journal-getitem?pii=S0002-9947-05-04005-5\nAlain Louveau and Christian Rosendal\n2.12. The Number of Near-Coherence Classes of Ultrafilters is Either Finite\nor 2c. We prove that the number of near-coherence classes of non-principal ultrafilters\non the natural numbers is either finite or 2c. Moreover, in the latter case the Stone\u010cech compactification \u03b2N of N contains a closed subset C consisting of 2c pairwise\nnon-nearly-coherent ultrafilters. We obtain some additional information about such\nclosed sets under certain assumptions involving the cardinal characteristics u and d.\nApplying our main result to the Stone-\u010cech remainder \u03b2R+ \\ R+ of the half-line\nR+ = [0, \u221e) we obtain that the number of composants of \u03b2R+ \\ R+ is either finite or\n2c.\nTaras Banakh and Andreas Blass\n2.13. The complexity of recursion theoretic games. We show that some natural\ngames introduced by Lachlan in 1970 as a model of recursion theoretic constructions\nare undecidable, contrary to what was previously conjectured. Several consequences\nare pointed out; for instance, the set of all \u03a02 -sentences that are uniformly valid in\nthe lattice of recursively enumerable sets is undecidable. Furthermore we show that\nthese games are equivalent to natural subclasses of effectively presented Borel games.\nhttp://www.ams.org/journal-getitem?pii=S0002-9947-05-04074-2\nMartin Kummer\n\n\fSPM BULLETIN 14 (September 2005)\n\n5\n\n2.14. Cosmic dimension. Martin's Axiom for \u03c3-centered partial orders implies that\nthere is a cosmic space with non-coinciding dimensions.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.GN/0509097\nAlan Dow and Klaas Pieter hart\n2.15. There is no categorical metric continuum. We show there is no categorical\nmetric continuum. This means that for every metric continuum X there is another\nmetric continuum Y such that X and Y have (countable) elementarily equivalent bases\nbut X and Y are not homeomorphic. As an application we show that the chainability\nof the pseudoarc is not a first-order property of its lattice of closed sets.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.GN/0509099\nKlaas Pieter Hart\n3. On a conjecture and a problem of Hurewicz\nA set of reals X has Menger's property (1924) if no continuous image of X in\nN is cofinal with respect to \u2264\u2217 . It has the formally stronger Hurewicz' property\n(1925) if every continuous image of X in N N is bounded. \u03c3-compactness implies\nHurewicz' property, which implies Menger's. Both Menger and Hurewicz conjectured\nthat their property characterizes \u03c3-compactness, and for a long time only consistent\ncounter-examples were known. Hurewicz (1927) also posed the problem whether\nthere is X \u2286 R which is Hurewicz but not Menger. The problem was raised again by\nBukovsk\u00fd and Hale\u0161 (2003).\nFremlin-Miller (1988) and then Just-Miller-Scheepers-Szeptycki (1996) gave a dichotomic existential argument refuting the Conjectures in ZFC. Using the Michael\ntopological technique, Chaber-Pol (2002) improved the dichotomic argument and essentially solved the Hurewicz Problem, alas in an existential manner.\nBarotszy\u0144ski-Tsaban (2002) gave two explicit counter-examples to the conjectures\nusing two specialized constructions. Tsaban-Zdomsky (2005) generalize both constructions and solve the Hurewicz Problem constructively by considering scales with\nrespect to semifilters (collections of infinite subsets of N closed under almost supersets). Working in P (N) (which is like N {0, 1}): For each feeble semifilter F and each\nF -scale S, all finite powers of X = S \u222a [N]<\u05d00 are Hurewicz and not \u03c3-compact.\nViewed appropriately as a subset of R, the field generated by X is Hurewicz, universally null, and universally meager. The Hurewicz problem is solved by using the\nsemifilter F = P\u221e (N), and choosing the F -scale's points such that (the enumerations\nof) their complements form an unbounded set. To carry this, descriptive set theoretic\nproperties of semifilters are used. When d is regular, subfields of R are constructed\nwhich are Menger but not Hurewicz. This implies (in a dichotomic manner) that\nthere always are such fields.\nAll results can be viewed as dealing with the Ramsey theory of open covers.\nThe work of Tsaban-Zdomsky, named Scales, fields, and a problem of Hurewicz, is\navailable at\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math.GN/0507043\nBoaz Tsaban\nN\n\n\f6\n\nSPM BULLETIN 14 (SEPTEMBER 2005)\n\n4. Problem of the Issue\nThe most interesting problem which arises from the work described in Section 3 is\nthe following.\nProblem 4.1. Does there exist (in ZFC) a set of reals X of cardinality d such that\nall finite powers of X have Menger's property Uf in (O, O)?\nWe know that the answer is \"Yes\" when d is regular. If the answer is positive,\nthen an explicit (non-dichotomic) construction of such a set would be even more\ninteresting.\nBoaz Tsaban\n5. Problems from earlier issues\nIssue 1.

Does X 6\u2208 NON(M) and Y 6\u2208 D imply that X \u222a Y 6\u2208 COF(M)?\nIssue 9. Is Split(\u039b, \u039b) preserved under taking finite unions?\nPartial solution. Consistently yes (Zdomsky). Is it \"No\" under CH?\n\n\u0003\n\nIssue 10. Is cov(M) = od? (See the definition of od in that issue.)\nIssue 11. Does S1 (\u0393, \u0393) always contain an element of cardinality b?\nIssue 12. Could there be a Baire metric space S\nM of weight \u05d01 and a partition U of\n\u2032\nM into \u05d01 meager sets where for each U \u2282 U, U \u2032 has the Baire property in M?\n\nPrevious issues.
