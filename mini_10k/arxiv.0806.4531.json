Even at room temperature submicron graphene structures act as a high-mobility electron\nor hole conductors1 . This phenomenon has brought to life a promising field of carbon-based nanoelectronics, where\ngraphene ribbons (GRs) could be used as connections in nanodevices.\nThe presence of armchair- and zigzag-shaped edges in graphene has strong implications for the spectrum of \u03c0electrons3,4,5,6,7 and drastically changes the conducting properties of GRs. Especially, a zigzag edge provides localized\nedge states close to the Fermi level (EF = 0), which leads to the metallic type of conductivity. In contrast, any\nlocalized state does not appear in an armchair GR. An armchair GR can be easily made to be either metallic or\nsemiconducting by controlling the width of the current channel.\nMost of the intriguing electronic properties of GRs were first predicted by the tight-binding model4,5,6,8,9,10,11 .\nThese features are also well reproduced in the k * p method12,13 based on the decomposition of linear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequations in the vicinity of zero-energy point. The commonly used k * p equation is a two-dimensional analog of the\nrelativistic Dirac equation1,3,13,14 , which is a certain approximation of general tight-binding Schr\u00f6dinger equations.\nThe continuum Dirac description of the electronic states near E = EF has been shown to be quite accurate by\ncomparing with a numerical solution in the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model3,14 . Particularly, in the framework\nof the Dirac approach, perfect electron transmission is predicted through any high and wide potential barriers, known\nas the Klein paradox in graphene15 .\nRecent analytical studies based on the relativistic Dirac equation have considered transmission through barriers15,\ngraphene wells16,17 , double-barriers18, quantum dots19 , superlattices20 , and n \u2212 p junctions21 . However, transport\nproperties of these structures in the tight-binding model has not been analyzed systematically yet. Considerable\nattention has been paid to the effects of conductance quantization in GRs in the absence of scattering, where the\nquantization steps clearly indicate the number of propagating states crossing the Fermi level11 .\nIn this paper, we develop an exact model of electron transport through armchair GRs based on the nearest-neighbor\ntight-binding approximation. (In contrast to the zigzag GRs, the armchair GR spectrum does not have a special band\nof edge states complicating the description.) We obtain simple analytical expressions for normalized wavefunctions\nand propagation velocity of an electron wave in armchair ribbons. No similar explicit solutions have been obtained for\narmchair GRs yet. In a tight-binding study by Zheng22 of the electronic structure in armchair ribbons, the derived\nanalytical form of wavefunction has not been used for describing charge transport in GRs.\nOn the basis of the analytical solutions for the wavefunction and propagation velocity of an electron in an infinite\narmchair GR, we describe the scattering problem through step-like and barrier-like profiles of site energy along the\n\n\f2\nribbon in closed form. Solving the corresponding equations for the scattering amplitudes, we obtain exact transmission\ncoefficients in the atomistic (tight-binding) model analytically. For the energy region close to the Fermi level we\ncompare our analytical expressions with their analogs obtained in the continuous (Dirac) model15 . Our general\nconclusion is that the validity of the relativistic approach based on the standard k * p equation13 is overestimated for\nthe description of charge transport in armchair GRs. Specifically, for one-mode propagation in semimetal GRs, the\ndeviation of transmission coefficients T from the unity near the zero-energy point is proportional to the square of the\nstep (barrier) magnitude, which contradicts the known Klein paradox in graphene15 . It is worth noting that similar\ndeviations of transmission coefficients are intrinsic for the extended k * p equation, based on higher order k * p terms\nin the low-energy limit. Such high-order approximations lead to predicting small backscattering due to the effects of\ntrigonal warping12 of the bands, destroying perfect transmission in the channel.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the framework of the nearest-neighbor tight-binding formalism we calculate\nenergy dispersion (Sec.II) and eigenstates (Sec. III) of electrons in the honeycomb graphene lattice. The lattice, in\ncontrast to Ref.22 , is considered as a set of rectangular elementary cells of four nonequivalent atoms (Fig. 1). This\nassumption simplifies the description of electron transport processes in GRs in the presence of step-like or barrier-like\nsite-energy profiles. Following Ref.23 , in Section IV we derive boundary conditions for infinite GRs with armchair\nedges. By using a combination of early found eigenstates of the honeycomb lattice, we obtain normalized wave\nsolutions for electrons in armchair GRs and formulate the quantization law for the transverse component k m of the\nwave vector. As a result, the full \u03c0-electron band spectra of graphene ribbon breaks into a set of subbands, whose\nfeatures are discussed in Section V.\nIn Section VI, we find the group velocity and propagation direction of an electron in an armchair ribbon. It is shown\nthat the group velocity is proportional to sin \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the electron phase shift between two neighboring unit cells\nof the ribbon. In sections VII and VIII, the transmission probabilities through step-like and barrier-like potentials are\ncalculated. Based on the exact solutions, in Section IX, we demonstrate that the transmission coefficients exhibit the\nnew kind of resonance occurring when cos \u03b8 = cos \u03b8\u0304, where \u03b8\u0304 is the inter-cell electron phase shift in the region where\nthe potential exists. The number and positions of the transmission resonances are shown to be different in the regions\nk m < 2\u03c0/3 and k m > 2\u03c0/3. As for one-mode propagation in semimetal GRs (k m = 2\u03c0/3), our theory predicts no\nunit propagation. In Section X, by expanding the expressions for cos \u03b8, cos \u03b8\u0304 in the vicinity of E = 0, we explain why\nthe Klein paradox does not hold in armchair GRs.\nIn Sec. XI, we discuss through-step and through-barrier probabilities and provide some examples. Conclusions are\npresented in Sec. XII. Appendices A (on electron flux in the tight-binding model) and B (on through-step transmission\nin a linear chain of identical atoms) describe some theoretical tools used in the paper. Appendix C contains some\ntechnical details related to obtaining our approximate solution from the Dirac solution15 .\nII.\n\nDISPERSION RELATION FOR HONEYCOMB GRAPHENE LATTICE\n\nWe consider the graphene honeycomb lattice as a set of rectangular elementary cells of four atoms \u03b1 = l, \u03bb, \u03c1, r (see\nFigure 1).

For\nboundary cells with m = 1 or m = N + 1, one needs to take into account that boundary carbons have only two\nneighbors (see Fig. 2). It demands the wave function to vanish on the set of absent sites7,23,26\n\u03c8n,0,l = 0,\n\n\u03c8n,0,r = 0,\n\n\u03c8n,N +1,l = 0,\n\n\u03c8n,N +1,r = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nSimilar boundary conditions were used in Refs9,22 .\nTo satisfy the relations (10), we represent the solution as a linear combination of the states (9),\n\u03c8n,m,\u03b1 (k n ) = \u03c8n,m,\u03b1 (k n , k m ) \u2212 \u03c8n,m,\u03b1 (k n , \u2212k m ).\nSince the definition (7) implies that \u03b8(\u2212k m ) = \u03b8(k m ), we finally obtain\n\uf8f1 ikn (n\u22121)+i\u03b8\ne\nsin k m m,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 ikn (n\u22121/2)\n\u00b1e\nsin k m (m \u2212 1/2),\n\u03c8n,m,\u03b1 (k n ) = C \u2032\nikn (n\u22121/2)+i\u03b8\n\u2213e\nsin k m (m \u2212 1/2),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 ikn n\nm\ne\nsin k m,\n\n\u03b1 = l,\n\u03b1 = \u03bb,\n\u03b1 = \u03c1,\n\u03b1 = r,\n\n(11)\n\n\f5\nwhere\nk m \u2261 kjm =\n\n\u03c0j\n,\nN +1\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . , N ,\n\n(12)\n\nis the set of discretized transversal wave numbers, and the unknown constant C \u2032 (\u2261 2iC) can be found from the\nnormalization condition over a unit cell of the armchair GR,\nN n\n+1 n\no NX\no\nX\n2\n2\n2\n2\n|\u03c8n,m,l | + |\u03c8n,m,r | +\n|\u03c8n,m,\u03bb | + |\u03c8n,m,\u03c1 | = 1.\n\nm=1\n\nm=1\n\nThen we finally get C \u2032 = [2(N + 1)]\u22121/2 .\nV.\n\nBAND SPECTRA OF ARMCHAIR GRS\n\nDue to the transverse momentum quantization (12), the full \u03c0-electron band spectra of an armchair GR breaks\ninto a set of subbands connected with each mode j independently. Given E and k m = kjm , the dispersion relation\n(4) allows us to establish some important peculiarities of the j-th part of the band spectra. Following the theory of\na one-dimensional crystal24 with an arbitrary electronic structure of the elementary cell, each j-th band of graphene\nelectron spectra includes 4 subbands, symmetrically disposed with respect to E = 0. Real values of longitudinal\nwave number k n \u2208 [0, \u03c0] define the region of propagating electron states (when |f (E, kjm )| < 1 in Eq.(4)). The cases\nf (E, kjm ) > 1 and f (E, kjm ) < \u22121 are related to the complex values of k m = i\u03b4 and k m = \u03c0 + i\u03b4, respectively. They\nrefer to the forbidden zones \u2013 the gaps between neighboring electron subbands and the regions above the highest\nsubband and below the lowest one. The subband boundaries correspond to k m = 0 or k m = \u03c0 and satisfy the\nsolutions to f (E, kjm ) = 1 or f (E, kjm ) = \u22121, respectively. Since Eq.(4) defines only one k m for each energy level E,\nthe subbands of the jth band cannot overlap, however, they may touch each other along the frontiers with the same\nk m (= 0, \u03c0).\nThe results of the band spectrum modeling for armchair GRs with N = 10 \u2212 12 are represented in Figure 3. Similar\nshapes are observed for GRs with arbitrary number N . The common features of the band spectra are: (I) bands\n\nkn= \u00f0\n\nE\n\n1=12\n\n1=11\n\n1=10\n\nE\n\nE\n\nn\n\nk =0\nkn=0\nk =\u00f0\nn\n\nj= 1 2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7 8 9 10\n\nj= 1 2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7 8 9 10 11\n\nj= 1 2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nFIG. 3: Examples of energy bands for armchair graphene ribbons with N = 10 \u2212 12. The transverse momentum quantization\nresults in subband series connected with each mode j independently. Gray (black) rectangles mark subbands, whose bottom\ncorresponds to kn = 0 (kn = \u03c0) and whose top \u2013 to kn = \u03c0 (kn = 0), as depicted in the framed panel. The border between\nblack and gray rectangles in the positive- and negative-energy spectra determines the subband connecting kn = \u03c0 frontiers, this\nis a degenerated solution to f (E, kjm ) = \u22121. The fundamental gap of a graphene ribbon is the minimal gap value \u2206 between\nthe valence and conduction bands among all modes j = 1, . . . , N .\n\nare bounded by the energy interval |E| \u2264 3; (II) the band structure is symmetric with respect to E = 0; (III) if the\nnumber N + 1 is divisible by 3, the mode j = 2(N + 1)/3 (or kjm = 2\u03c0/3) does not possess the energetic gap between\npositive- and negative-energy bands, and, therefore, it possesses the semimetal type of electron conductivity3,7,9,22 .\nFor other j-modes there is a gap\n\u2206 = 2 1 \u2212 2 cos\n\nkm\n2\n\n(13)\n\nbetween positive- and negative-energy subbands, which corresponds to a semiconducting ribbon whose gap decreases\nwith increasing N .\n\n\f6\nVI.\n\nPROPAGATION VELOCITY\n\nTo obtain propagation velocity of the wave, we plug in the solution (11) into the relation (A2) for the electron flux\nJ. Then J = |\u03b2| sin \u03b8/2h\u0304. Using the definition (7) and the first derivative of the dispersion relation (4) with respect\nto E, one can get\n2 sin k n cos2 k2\n|\u03b2|\nh\u0304 E E 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 4 cos2\n\nm\n\nJ =\u2212\n\nkm\n2\n\n\u0001=\n\n|\u03b2| dE\n.\nh\u0304 dk n\n\nRepresenting the flux J as (|\u03b2|/h\u0304)v(k n ), where v(k n ) is the dimensionless group velocity, we finally obtain\nv(k n ) =\n\ndE\nsin \u03b8\n=\n.\ndk n\n2\n\n(14)\n\nThe sign of v in Eq. (14) determines the moving direction of the propagating wave (11). For a subband (=\u03c00 ),\nwhose bottom corresponds to k n = 0 and top to k n = \u03c0 (see Fig. 3), the wave number k n increases along with E\n(dE/dk n > 0). Therefore, v > 0 and the\u0001 state (11) describes the right-moving mode.\nSimilarly, in a subband of type =0\u03c0 , we have dE/dk n < 0, and the wave solution (11) propagates to the left.\nReplacing k n with \u2212k n in (7), (11), we obtain the expression describing a right-moving mode in these subbands\n\uf8f1 \u2212ikn (n\u22121)\u2212i\u03b8\ne\nsin k m m,\n\u03b1 = l,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212ikn (n\u22121/2)\n\u00b1e\nsin k m (m \u2212 1/2),\n\u03b1 = \u03bb,\nn\n\u2032\nn\n(15)\n\u03c8n,m,\u03b1 (\u2212k ) = C\n\u2213e\u2212ik (n\u22121/2)\u2212i\u03b8 sin k m (m \u2212 1/2), \u03b1 = \u03c1,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2212ikn n\nm\ne\nsin k m,\n\u03b1 = r.\n\nFrom (11) and (15), one can understand the physical meaning of the quantity \u03b8. Expressing \u03c8n+1,m,l (\u00b1k n ) via\n\u03c8n,m,r (\u00b1k n ), we get \u03c8n+1,m,l (\u00b1k n ) = e\u00b1i\u03b8 \u03c8n,m,r (\u00b1k n ), i.e., an electron, propagating through the corresponding\nsubbands, gains phase shift \u00b1\u03b8 between two neighboring unit cells of GR. The phase shift \u03b8 plays an important role\n\u03c0\nin electron transmission through the\n\u0001 ribbons, as discussed below. Also note that sin \u03b8 > 0 inside the (=0 )-subbands\n0\nand sin \u03b8 < 0 in the subbands =\u03c0 , which is also seen from the relation (14).\nThe derived analytical form of the wavefunctions (11), (15) and the expression (14) for propagation velocity will be\nused below to investigate transport properties of armchair GRs in the presence of step-like or barrier-like potentials.\nVII.\n\nTRANSMISSION PROBABILITY THROUGH A POTENTIAL STEP\n\nIn this section, we derive the transmission coefficient for an electron with energy E, transverse and longitudinal\nwave numbers k m , k n , meeting the electrostatic potential\n\u001a\n0, n \u2264 0,\nV (n) =\nV0 , n \u2265 1,\nleft\n\nright\n\nin an armchair ribbon. We denote the wavefunction by \u03c8n,m,\u03b1 for n \u2264 0 and \u03c8n,m,\u03b1 for n \u2265 1. Let U0 \u2261 eV0 /|\u03b2|.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equations for all atoms in both leads are used to obtain the probabilities of electron scattering\nthrough the potential step. The comparison of these equations near the interface between two regions (n = 0, 1)\nallows us to write down the matching conditions26 as follows\nleft\n\nright\n\n\u03c80,m,r = \u03c80,m,r ,\n\nleft\n\nright\n\n\u03c81,m,l = \u03c81,m,l ,\n\nm = 1, . . . , N .\n\n(16)\n\nSimilar conditions for the tight-binding model were used in Ref.10 and for the Dirac equation in Refs.14,15,17 .\nSince the matching conditions (16) do not mix the modes, we need to sew only the j-th solutions in each region\nunder study. Wave solutions, describing incident and reflected electron waves in the left lead, can be constructed from\nthe states (11) and (15). For the right region, one needs to take into account the shift of site energies produced by\nthe applied potential.

The Fermi level is assumed to be located\nin a (=\u03c00 )-subband of the left lead and incident wave is described by the solution (11). a) Electron propagates through a\n(=\u03c00 )-subband in the right region; b) the\n\u0001 Fermi level belongs to the band-gap of the right lead, which results in total reflection;\nc) electron propagates through a =0\u03c0 -subband in the right region. This case corresponds to the solution (15) for an outgoing\nwave in the lead.\n\nwe first consider the case of propagation through the (=\u03c00 )-subbands in both regions, as depicted on the a-panel of\nFig. 5. The solutions describing the incident and reflected electron waves in the left lead and the outgoing wave in\nthe right region should be taken in the following form\ni\ni\nh n\nh n\nleft\nn\nleft\nn\n(18)\n\u03c8n,m,l = eik (n\u22121)+i\u03b8 + re\u2212ik (n\u22121)\u2212i\u03b8 sin kjm m, \u03c8n,m,r = eik n + re\u2212ik n sin kjm m,\nright\n\n\u03c8n,m,l = teik\u0304\n\nn\n\n(n\u22121)+i\u03b8\u0304\n\nsin kjm m,\n\nright\n\n\u03c8n,m,r = teik\u0304\n\nn\n\nn\n\nsin kjm m,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere r and t are the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves excited by the incident wave with transverse\nmode j. (We omit the factor C \u2032 for simplicity.) After plugging in 18), (19) into the conditions (16), we get the\nfollowing two equations\n\u001a\n1 + r = t,\nei\u03b8 + re\u2212i\u03b8 = tei\u03b8\u0304 .\nTheir solution is\nr=\u2212\n\nei\u03b8\u0304 \u2212 ei\u03b8\n,\nei\u03b8\u0304 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03b8\n\nt=\n\n2i sin \u03b8\n.\n\u2212 e\u2212i\u03b8\n\nei\u03b8\u0304\n\n(20)\n\nThe reflection and transmission probabilities R and T can be directly found from the scattering amplitudes r, t,\nusing their definitions: R = |r|2 and T = |t|2 v\u0304(k\u0304 n )/v(k n ) = |t|2 sin \u03b8\u0304/ sin \u03b8. In this way, we obtain the expression for\n\n\f8\nan electron propagating via (=\u03c00 )-subbands in both leads\nT =\n\n4 sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u0304\n\u00012\n\u00012 .\n4 sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u0304 + sin \u03b8\u0304 \u2212 sin \u03b8 + cos \u03b8\u0304 \u2212 cos \u03b8\n\nThe b-panel of Figure 5 corresponds to the case when the electron energy belongs to the forbidden band in the\nright region (it is impossible for one-mode propagation through a semimetal ribbon with a zero-gap, kjm = 2\u03c0/3). In\nthis case, the wave number k\u0304 n takes imaginary values, and the expression for t in (20) is to be omitted. At the same\ntime, for imaginary-valued k\u0304 n the expression for ei\u03b8\u0304 becomes real, which results in R = 1 after using the r-solution\nfrom (20).\n\u0001\nFor an electron moving through a =0\u03c0 -subband in the right lead, the c-panel of Figure 5, we use the solution (15)\nfor an outgoing wave (see the definitions (17)). Thus, we obtain\nT =\n\n\u22124 sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u0304\n\u00012\n\u00012 ,\n\u22124 sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u0304 + sin \u03b8\u0304 + sin \u03b8 + cos \u03b8\u0304 \u2212 cos \u03b8\n\nwhere sin \u03b8\u0304 < 0, as stated in Sec.VI. In a similar way, one can determine the transmission coefficient for an electron\npropagating through arbitrary subbands in the left and right leads\nT step =\n\n4| sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u0304|\n\u00012\n\u00012 .\n4| sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u0304| + | sin \u03b8\u0304| \u2212 | sin \u03b8| + cos \u03b8\u0304 \u2212 cos \u03b8\n\n(21)\n\nThe common relation (21) must be supplemented with the expressions for cos \u03b8, cos \u03b8\u0304 determined from (7) and (17).\nThen, from the energy dispersion (4), we finally obtain\ncos \u03b8 = g(E, k m ),\n\ncos \u03b8\u0304 = g(E \u2212 U0 , k m ),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the function g is described by the simple relation\nE 2 + 1 \u2212 4 cos2\ng(E, k ) = \u2212\n2E\nm\n\nkm\n2\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nThe analytical expression (21) with the definitions (22), (23) is one of the central points of this paper since it makes\nit possible to compute the transmission coefficient through a potential step without recourse to the initial dispersion\nrelation (4).\nIt is worth noting how similar the solution (21) to the relation (B4) is, though the relation (B4) is for through-step\ntransmission coefficient in the 1D undimerized chain of identical atoms. In other words, the inter-cell variables \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304\nfor GRs act as wave numbers k, k\u0304 in the linear chain model, whose unit cell degenerates to a zero-sized atom.

Particularly, Eq.(28) has no solution for a function g(E, k m ) that is monotonic with respect\nto E, except when U0 = 0, the usual condition of the unit transmission.\nFor the case of one-mode propagation in semimetal GRs (k m = 2\u03c0/3) the relation (23) reduces to the simple linear\ndependence\ng(E, k m ) = \u2212E/2,\n\n(29)\n\nwhich corresponds to the absence of perfect transmission. In cases of one-mode propagation in semiconducting GRs\n(k m 6= 2\u03c0/3), due to the oddness of g with respect to E, we confine our attention to the properties of g(E, k m ) inside\nthe positive-energy region E > 0.

For the case when 0 < k m < 2\u03c0/3, we obtain\ndg/dE 6= 0 and d2 g/dE 2 < 0. Hence g(E, k m ) is convex and monotone decreasing. Figure 7 presents the in-band\nbehaviour of g(E, k m ) with respect to E for the above mentioned k m -domains: k m = 2\u03c0/3 \u2212 0.1(< 2\u03c0/3), k m = 2\u03c0/3,\nand k m = 2\u03c0/3 + 0.1(> 2\u03c0/3).\nAs follows from the relation (28), the transmission probabilities (21) and (27) reach unity at the points where the\ncurve g(E, k m ) crosses g(E \u2212U0 , k m ). Such intersections are possible even for U0 \u226a 1 in the region 2\u03c0/3 < k m \u2264 \u03c0 (see\nFigure 7), where the resonance occurs near the energy level (30). In the case when 0 < k m < 2\u03c0/3, unit propagation\ntakes place if the value of U0 exceeds the energy gap \u2206. To show this, we plug in the relation (23) into Eq.

If 2\u03c0/3 < k m \u2264 \u03c0, the indicated\nregion |U0 | \u2264 1 contains two resonances, one of which belongs to the valence band, and another to the conduction\nband. In the case when 0 < k m < 2\u03c0/3, two unit transmissions are observed if the condition (33) holds. The resonance\npositions depend on the sign of U0 . Both of them belong to the valence band if U0 > 0 and to the conduction band\nif U0 < 0.\nThe case of one-mode propagation in semimetal ribbons (k m = 2\u03c0/3) deserves additional attention. The linear\ndependence of g(E, k m ) with respect to E (given by Eq. (29)), makes unit propagation impossible. This shows that\nthe Klein paradox15 does not hold in armchair GRs. Specifically, plugging in (22) and (29) into (21) produces\np\n4 (4 \u2212 E 2 )[4 \u2212 (E \u2212 U0 )2 ]\nT = \u0010\u221a\n,\n(34)\n\u00112\np\n4 \u2212 E 2 + 4 \u2212 (E \u2212 U0 )2 + U02\nwhich can be reduced to\n\nT \u2248 1 \u2212 U02 /16\n\n(35)\n\nfor E = 0 and |U0 | \u226a 1.\nIt is worth noting that the through-step expression (34) coincides with its analog for electron transmission through\na potential step in an undimerized linear chain of identical atoms (see Appendix B). Specifically, the through-step\ncoefficient (34) in the vicinity of the neutrality point E = 0 is exactly the same as the transmission coefficient through\na step potential formed in the linear chain when the electron energy is located near the corresponding band center.\nX.\n\nLOW-ENERGY LIMIT\n\nMost theoretical studies on the electronic properties of all-carbon honeycomb lattices are based on the k * p approximation in the vicinity of the zero-energy point, leading to the two-dimensional analog of the relativistic Dirac\nequation1,3,13,15 .

This coincidence is not surprising. However, no \"Dirac\" analog of the throughstep coefficient (41) has been obtained so far.\nEqs.(41) and (42) show that step-like and barrier-like potentials become transparent in the case of the so-called\n\"normal incidence\", ky = 0 (or \u03c6 = \u03c6\u0304 = 0), which produces the Klein paradox in graphene15 . However, such\ntransparency of potentials does not occur if exact tight-binding solutions are written in the low-energy limit.

Thus, we conclude that the relativistic approach based on the standard k * p scheme should not be applied\nwithout amendments for describing electron transport through the gapless modes. The next non-vanishing term of\nthe expansion (43) \"disables\" the Klein paradox: the expression (cos \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u0304)2 entering Eqs. (21) and (27) becomes\nquadratic on U0 , which results in the same order deviation of the exact transmission coefficients (21) and (27) from\nunity (see Eq. (35)).\nEvidently, since |ky | increases proportionally to |k m \u2212 2\u03c0/3|, we can restrict attention only to the first term in (43)\nif |ky | is large enough, which makes the analytical solutions (21) and (27) similar to the approximate dependencies\n(41) and (42) for the Dirac formalism.\nXI.\n\nMODELING AND DISCUSSION\n\nNow we compare the exact tight-binding solutions (21) and (27) with the approximate expressions (41) and (42).\nFigure 9 represents U0 -dependence of the through-step transmission coefficients (21) and (41) for three different values\nof k m : (a) k m = 2\u03c0/3 \u2212 0.018, (b) k m = 2\u03c0/3, and (c) k m = 2\u03c0/3 + 0.018. We assume the electron energy E is fixed:\n(a,c) E = EF = 0.02 and (b) E = EF = 0. Simple estimations show that this choice leads to single-mode propagation\nin graphene ribbons having (a) N = 58, (b) N = 59, and (c) N = 60 elementary cells in the transverse direction.\nThese curves are very closed to each other when |U0 | < 0.1, as depicted in Fig. 9. Thus, the approximation (41) for\nthe low-voltage region is numerically indistinguishable from the exact solution (21).\nWhen |U0 | < 1, the exact tight-binding solution (21) for k m = 2\u03c0/3 + 0.018, unlike the approximate solution (41),\nreveals two extreme points, as indicated in the Figure 9c. The existence of such transmission peculiarities follows\nfrom the definition (22) an the following chain of identities\ndT\ndg(E)\ndT d\u03b8\u0304\ndT d cos \u03b8\u0304\ndT dg(E \u2212 U0 )\ndT\n=\n=\n=\n=\u2212\ndU0\ndU0\nd\u03b8\u0304 dU0\nd cos \u03b8\u0304 dU0\nd cos \u03b8\u0304\nd cos \u03b8\u0304 dE\n\n.\nE\u2192E\u2212U0\n\nm\nThus,\np the additional peak and dip of the transmission coefficient are the extreme points of g(E, k > 2\u03c0/3),\n2\nm\n\u00b1 1 \u2212 4 cos (k /2), as discussed in Sec. IX.\nIt is also important that the exact dependence (21) for k m 6= 2\u03c0/3 predicts unit transmission at applied electrostatic\nenergy U0res = EF \u2212 x/EF , which is the solution to (31) with respect to U0 . However, in the case under consideration\nthese resonances are out of the indicated region: U0res > 1 for k m < 2\u03c0/3, and U0res < \u22121 if k m > 2\u03c0/3.\nFigure 10 depicts the through-barrier transmission coefficients (27) and (42) for the same values of k m and EF , as\nFig. 9. To make the curves more distinguishable, we consider a narrow barrier, N = 10. One can see the series of\npronounced peaks associated with the resonance conditions k\u0304 n N \u2261 k\u0304x D = \u03c0l (l = 0, 1, . . .). A visual comparison of\nthe approximation (42) with the exact solution (27) shows that they are closed to each other in the low-voltage region.\nHowever, there are some discrepancies in the resonance positions, especially in the depth of dips outside the low-voltage\nregion. Discrepancies of this kind are also observed between the exact and approximate through-step solutions (21)\nand (41) over the entire U0 -region. Formally, if the barrier-induced system is considered as a combination of two\nscatterers \u2013 interfaces between the external and disturbed leads, the through-barrier probability T bar can be written\n\n\f14\n\nm\n\nk =2\u00f0/3-0.018\nEF=0.02\nN=10\n\na)\n\nTransmission\n\nTransmission\n\nTransmission\n\nm\n\nk =2\u00f0/3\nEF=0\nN=10\n\nb)\n\nU0\n\nU0\n\nm\n\nk =2\u00f0/3+0.018\nEF=0.02\nN=10\n\nc)\nU0\n\nFIG. 10: Through-barrier transmission coefficients (27) (solid line) and (42) (dashed line) versus U0 calculated for a) km =\n2\u03c0/3 \u2212 0.018 and EF = 0.02; b) km = 2\u03c0/3, EF = 0; c) km = 2\u03c0/3 + 0.018, EF = 0.02. The grey rectangle is the region of\ntunneling through a gap which is not studied here.\n\ndown in terms of the through-step transmission T step. The probability T bar varies within the interval defined by (32)\nfrom Ref.25\n\u00132\n\u0012\nT step\n\u2264 T bar \u2264 1,\n2 \u2212 T step\nwhich can also be observed from the behaviour of the corresponding through-step coefficient depicted in Fig. 9.\nObviously, as |k m \u2212 2\u03c0/3| increases the exact (tight-binding) and approximate solutions for through-step and\nthrough-barrier transmissions in the low-voltage region (|U0 | \u226a 1) are closer to each other. This also follows from\nSec. X, specifically from the expansion (43).\nNow we consider propagation through a gapless band (k m = 2\u03c0/3). Despite visual coincidence of the exact tightbinding solutions with unity in the low-voltage region (Figs. 9b and 10b) the dependences (21) and (27) do not reveal\nunit propagation for the whole low-voltage region. Thus, the Klein paradox, which strongly predicts that T = 1 for\none-mode propagation through any high and wide potential barriers in semimetal ribbons, fails since the through-step\nand through-barrier coefficients T step(bar) differ from unity though the corresponding deviations are indistinguishable\nat experimentally reliable values |U0 | \u226a 1.\nXII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the framework of the tight-binding model, we present a full and closed description of electron transport in\narmchair GRs. Starting with the tight-binding Schr\u00f6dinger equations for a 2D honeycomb lattice, we identify the\nboundary conditions, wave function and propagation velocity of an electron in armchair GRs. We obtain analytical\nexpressions for the through-step and through-barrier transmission coefficients and demonstrate that new type transmission resonances exist. Such resonances occur when cos \u03b8 = cos \u03b8\u0304, where \u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304 are the inter-cell electron phase\nshifts in the corresponding regions. We show that the number and positions of the resonances are strongly dependent\non the electron transverse wave number k m . In particular, at k m = 2\u03c0/3 (propagation through a gapless band), the\nresonances are absent, and the through-step transmission coefficient reduces to the relation known for through-step\npropagation in a linear chain of identical atoms. For the low-energy limit, the deviation of the through-step transmission coefficient from unity is proportional to the square of applied potential energy. A similar deviation is also\nobserved for the through-barrier transmission coefficient.\nThe discrepancy between our tight-binding result and the Klein paradox in graphene becomes evident as a result of\nexpanding the expressions for cos \u03b8 and cos \u03b8\u0304 in the vicinity of the zero-energy point. We show that in the low-energy\nlimit these expressions come to negligibly small terms, which are ignored in the well-known k * p method leading\nto the relativistic Dirac equation. These negligibly small terms \"destroy\" unit propagation and produce a small\nbackscattering proportional to U02 .\nThe presented analytical results are in complete agreement with the results of the numerical computations made\nin the paper.\n\n\f15\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are deeply thankful to Pavlo Prokopovych for editing the manuscript.

For the sake of convenience, we keep the same notation for E \u2261 E/|\u03b2| and U0 = eV0 /|\u03b2|.\nFollowing Fig. 11, we need to determine the solution to the following system of linear Schr\u00f6dinger equations\n\uf8f1\nleft\nleft\nleft\n\uf8f4\n\u2212E\u03c8n = \u03c8n\u22121 + \u03c8n+1 , n < 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nleft\nleft\nright\n\uf8f2\n\u2212E\u03c80 = \u03c8\u22121 + \u03c81 ,\n(B1)\nright\nleft\nright\n\uf8f4\n(U\n= \u03c80 + \u03c82 ,\n0 \u2212 E)\u03c81\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nright\nright\nright\n\uf8f3\n(U0 \u2212 E)\u03c8n = \u03c8n\u22121 + \u03c8n+1 , n > 1,\nwhere\n\nleft\n\n\u03c8n = eikn + re\u2212ikn ,\n\nright\n\n\u03c8n\n\n= teik\u0304n ,\n\n(B2)\n\n\f16\nV(n)\n\n...\n\nV0\n-2\n\n\u00e2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u00e2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u00e2\n\n3\n\n...n\n\nright\n\nleft\n\nFIG. 11: Model of the linear chain of atoms coupled by the electron-transfer integral \u03b2. As in the main text, atoms with n \u2264 0\ncorrespond to the left lead, and n \u2265 1 \u2013 to the right lead.\n\nr and t are the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves, respectively, k and k\u0304 are the non-dimensional wave\nnumbers in the left and right regions. One can see that the first and forth equations in (B1) are satisfied identically if\ncos k = \u2212\n\nE\n,\n2\n\ncos k\u0304 = \u2212\n\nE \u2212 U0\n.\n2\n\n(B3).\n\nPlugging in (B2) into the second and third equations from (B1) gives the system of two linear equations\n1 + r = t,\n\neik + e\u2212ik r = eik\u0304 t.\n\nThe solution to the system is\nr=\u2212\n\neik\u0304 \u2212 eik\n,\neik\u0304 \u2212 e\u2212ik\n\nt=\n\n2i sin k\n.\n\u2212 e\u2212ik\n\neik\u0304\n\nThus, the transmission coefficient determined as T = |t|2 sin k\u0304/ sin k can be represented as\nT =\n\n4 sin k sin k\u0304\n\u00012\n\u00012 .\n4 sin k sin k\u0304 + sin k\u0304 \u2212 sin k + cos k\u0304 \u2212 cos k\n\n(B4)\n\nSince the values of sin k and sin k\u0304 are positive in the corresponding bands (0 \u2264 (k, k\u0304) \u2264 \u03c0) one can come to an\nexpression similar to (34) for the transmission coefficient.\nTherefore, independently on the Fermi position inside the band, electron propagation through a potential step in\na graphene ribbon is described by the same through-step relation as in an undimerized 1D chain with the same ratio\nU0 = eV0 /|\u03b2|.\nAPPENDIX C: RELATIVISTIC DIRAC SOLUTION FOR THE ELECTRON REFLECTION\nPROBABILITY THROUGH A POTENTIAL BARRIER.\n\nThe reflection amplitude from a potential barrier obtained through the Dirac formalism is described by Eq.
