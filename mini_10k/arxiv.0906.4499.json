Introduction\nLet Rn>0 be the set of all n-tupels ` = (`1 , . . . , `n ) with each `i a positive real\nnumber. For ` \u2208 Rn>0 we define the planar polygon space M` as\n),\n(\nn\nX\n`i zi = 0\nSO(2),\nM` =\nz \u2208 Tn\ni=1\n\nwhere T n = (S 1 )n is the standard torus and SO(2) acts on T n by rotating each\ncoordinate. The elements of M` can be considered as closed configurations up to\nrotation and translation of a robot arm with n bars, where ` determines the length\nof each bar. For this reason we also call ` a length vector.\nGiven a subset J \u2282 {1, . . . , n} we can look at the hyperplane HJ defined by\nn\no\nX\nX\nHJ =\nx \u2208 Rn\nxj =\nxj .\nj \u2208J\n/\n\nj\u2208J\n\nThen\nRn>0 \u2212\n\n[\n\nHJ\n\nJ\u2282{1,...,n}\n\nconsists of finitely many open components which we call chambers. It is possible\nto decompose Rn>0 further into strata, compare [6], but here we will mainly be\ninterested in chambers. It is known that if ` and `0 are in the same chamber, then\nM` and M`0 are O(1)-diffeomorphic manifolds, where O(1) \u223c\n= Z/2 acts on M` by\ncomplex conjugation, see [11]. Length vectors contained in a chamber are called\ngeneric.\nAlso, if \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3n is a permutation and `0 = (`\u03c3(1) , . . . , `\u03c3(n) ), we get a diffeomorphism\nM` \u223c\n= M`0 by permuting coordinates. We can therefore assume that ` is ordered,\nthat is, we have ` = (`1 , . . . , `n ) with `1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 `n .\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Configuration spaces, planar linkages, Walker conjecture.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\nThe isomorphism problem for planar polygon spaces now asks whether diffeomorphic (or homeomorphic, or homotopy equivalent) polygon spaces are in the same\nchamber up to permutation.\nThe topology of planar polygon spaces has been considered by many authors, let\nus list Hausmann [10], Kapovich and Millson [15], Kamiyama, Tezuka and Toma\n[14], and Milgram and Trinkle [16] to name a few.\nIn an unpublished undergraduate thesis [17], Kevin Walker gave a formula for the\nhomology groups of M` for generic `. This formula was later recovered in [8]; a\nreader-friendly approach can be found in [4]. For n \u2264 5 the Betti numbers of M`\ndetermine the chamber up to permutation, which is easily seen by checking all\npossible chambers, but for n \u2265 6 the Betti numbers alone do not determine the\nchamber. However, Walker asked whether the ring structure of H \u2217 (M` ) determines\nthe chamber up to permutation.\nConjecture 1.1 (Walker [17]). Let `, `0 be generic length vectors. If H \u2217 (M` ) \u223c\n=\nH \u2217 (M`0 ) are isomorphic as graded rings, then ` and `0 are in the same chamber up\nto permutation.\nIn order to tackle this conjecture, we need a sufficient understanding of the cohomology ring structure of these polygon spaces, together with a way to recover\nthe chamber from the isomorphism class of the cohomology ring. Except in some\nspecial cases, the cohomology is not generated by elements of degree one. Instead\nwe can look at the subring generated by elements of degree one, which is a quotient\nof an exterior algebra. For a certain class of such quotients it is possible to uniquely\nrecover a minimal set of relations from the ring by a result of Gubeladze, see [9]\nand [2].\nWe show that this strategy leads indeed to a positive answer of Walker's Conjecture.\nTheorem 1.2. Conjecture 1.1 is true.\nAs a corollary we see that length vectors from different chambers do have different\npolygon spaces.\nCorollary 1.3. Let ` and `0 be generic length vectors with homotopy equivalent\nplanar polygon spaces M` , M`0 . Then ` and `0 are in the same chamber up to\npermutation.\nIn [6], Farber, Hausmann and the author proved this for a large class of length\nvectors, for which the subring generated by elements of degree one is a quotient of an\nexterior algebra \u039bZ [X1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 ]/I` . Here I` is the ideal generated by monomials\nXi1 * * * Xik provided that {i1 , . . . , ik , n} is long (see Definition 2.1 for the definition\nof long). Gubeladze's result applies exactly to ideals generated by monomials which\nthen can be used to recover the chamber.\nFor the remaining cases the subring turns out to be more complicated. In particular,\nthe quotient ideal is no longer generated by monomials only. Gubeladze's theorem\ncan therefore not be applied directly. However, the ideal is still well behaved enough\nso that the problem can be reduced to a situation where this theorem applies.\nThe proof is organized as follows. In Section 2 we analyze the missing cases and\ncategorize them into several subcases which we call types. In Section 3 we use\nrational cohomology and Betti numbers to show that different types lead indeed\n\n\fTHE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM FOR PLANAR POLYGON SPACES\n\n3\n\nto different cohomology rings. The problem is therefore reduced to showing the\nstatement of Walker's Conjecture for ` and `0 of the same type. This does not seem\ntoo promising at first, as we have n \u2212 1 different types for every n. However, for\nmost of these types we can determine the cohomology by an induction argument\non the type. This is done in Sections 5 and 6. Section 7 deals with another type\nand the remaining cases are fairly easy to handle.\nTo determine the cohomology we use the following strategy: the subring generated\nby elements of degree 1 or 0 is the quotient of an exterior algebra. We give a set of\nrelations which we show to hold, and then show that there can be no more relations\nusing a Morse theory argument. The necessary Morse theory is set up in Section\n4. The relations come from two sources, one set of relations comes from a natural\ninclusion of the polygon space into a torus. The other set of relations comes from\nthe fundamental group.\nThe relevant fundamental groups turn out to be not too complicated. They are\neither right-angled Artin groups or fairly simple iterated HNN-extensions of surface groups, so that their integral cohomology can be easily expressed in terms of\nrelations. Again Morse theory is used to determine the fundamental groups.\nInstead of planar polygon spaces one can look at higher dimensional analogues. For\npolygons in R3 the analogue of Walker's Conjecture was proven in [6] under the\nextra assumption n > 4. The case n = 4 does in fact not hold as there exist two\ndifferent chambers for which the spatial polygon space is S 2 . The proof is based\non a description of the cohomology given in [12], which can be modified so that\nGubeladze's theorem is applicable. In higher dimensions the analogue of Walker's\nConjecture is not known; it does hold however for a modified configuration space,\nsee [7].\n2. Planar polygon spaces\nBy rotating the last coordinate to 1, we can embed M` into T n\u22121 and we get\n)\n(\nn\u22121\nX\nn\u22121\n`i zi = `n .\nz\u2208T\nM` \u223c\n=\ni=1\n\nComplex conjugation in each coordinate induces involutions \u03c4 : M` \u2192 M` and\n\u03c4 : T n\u22121 \u2192 T n\u22121 which clearly commute with inclusion.\nDefinition 2.1. Let ` \u2208 Rn>0 be a length vector. A subset J \u2282 {1, . . . , n} is called\nshort with respect to `, if\nX\nX\n`j <\n`j .\nj\u2208J\n\nj \u2208J\n/\n\nSimilarly J is called long with respect to `, if the complement of J is short with\nrespect to `.\nBy abuse of notation we will only write short, respectively long, if the length vector\nis clear. For a generic length vector ` all subsets J \u2282 {1, . . . , n} are either short or\nlong, and the short subsets determine the chamber.\nIf ` is ordered, we define for k \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 3}\n\u1e60k (`)\n\n=\n\n{ J \u2282 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} | J \u222a {n} is short and |J| = k} .\n\n\f4\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\nIf ` is not ordered, we define\n\u1e60k (`)\n\n= {\u03c3 \u22121 (J) | J \u2208 \u1e60k (`\u03c3)},\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3n is a permutation such that `\u03c3 = (`\u03c3(1) , . . . , `\u03c3(n) ) is ordered.\nIt is easy to see that for generic ` the chamber is determined by the sets \u1e60k (`). We\nget the following formula for the homology groups of M` :\nTheorem 2.2 (Walker [17], Farber-Sch\u00fctz [8]). Let ` be a generic length vector,\nand ak = |\u1e60k (`)| for k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 3. Then\nHk (M` )\n\n= Zak \u2295 Zan\u22123\u2212k\n\nfor all k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 3.\nIf ` is not generic, Hk (M` ) has an extra Z-summand for every subset J \u2282 {1, . . . , n\u2212\n1} with k elements such that J \u222a{n} is neither short nor long, compare [8] (assuming\n`n to be maximal).\nDefinition 2.3. Let ` be a generic length vector. Then ` is called normal, if\n\u1e60n\u22124 (`) = \u2205.\nTheorem 2.4 (Farber-Hausmann-Sch\u00fctz [6]). Let `, `0 be generic length vectors\nwith ` normal. If H \u2217 (M` ) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (M`0 ) are isomorphic as graded rings, then ` and\n0\n` are in the same chamber up to permutation.\nIntuitively, it is clear that for large values of n only a small proportion of length\nvectors are not normal. For a more precise statement see [5, Prop.6.2].\nIt is known that there is only one chamber up to permutation with \u1e60n\u22123 (`) 6= \u2205, see,\nfor example, [8, Ex.2], so Conjecture 1.1 is reduced to dealing with length vectors\nsatisfying \u1e60n\u22123 (`) = \u2205 =\n6 \u1e60n\u22124 (`).\nDefinition 2.5. A generic length vector ` is called special, if \u1e60n\u22123 (`) = \u2205 6=\n\u1e60n\u22124 (`).\nIt follows from [6, Lm.7] that special length vectors ` are indeed detected by the\ncohomology of M` . Note that the proof of [6, Lm.7] simplifies if one only considers\ngeneric length vectors.\nThe power set of {1, . . . , n\u22121}, P({1, . . . , n\u22121}), can be given the following partial\norder, compare [13]. We say J1 \u2264 J2 , if there exists an order-preserving injective\nfunction \u03c6 : J1 \u2192 J2 with x \u2264 \u03c6(x) for all x \u2208 J1 .\nLet\n\u1e60(`)\n\n=\n\nn\u22123\n[\n\n\u1e60k (`).\n\nk=0\n\nIf ` is ordered and J \u2208 \u1e60(`), then I \u2208 \u1e60(`) for all I \u2264 J. In particular the chamber\nof a generic and ordered length vector ` is determined by the maximal elements of\n(\u1e60(`), \u2264).\nLemma 2.6. Let ` be an ordered, special length vector. Then (\u1e60n\u22124 (`), \u2264) is totally\nordered.\n\n\fTHE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM FOR PLANAR POLYGON SPACES\n\n5\n\nProof. Let J1 , J2 \u2208 \u1e60n\u22124 (`) and let J \u03041 , J \u03042 denote the complements in {1, . . . , n\u22121}.\nThen J \u03041 and J \u03042 are long with respect to `. Write J1 = {i1 , i2 , i3 } with i1 < i2 < i3\nand J2 = {j1 , j2 , j3 } with j1 < j2 < j3 . It is easy to see that J1 \u2264 J2 is equivalent\nto ir \u2264 jr for r = 1, 2, 3.\nIf J \u03041 \u2229 J \u03042 contains at least two elements, we get J1 \u2264 J2 or J2 \u2264 J1 , so assume\n|J \u03041 \u2229 J \u03042 | \u2264 1. We get that one of the sets {i1 , i2 , n}, {i1 , i3 , n} or {i2 , i3 , n} is a subset\nof J2 \u222a{n}. Therefore {i1 , i2 , n} is short, but this implies that {i1 , i2 , i3 } \u2264 {i1 , i2 , n}\nis also short, which is a contradiction to J1 \u2208 \u1e60n\u22124 (`).\n\u0003\nDefinition 2.7. Let ` be an ordered special length vector. The type of ` is defined\nas the complement of the maximal element of \u1e60n\u22124 (`). In other words, the type is\nthe minimal subset of {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} with three elements that is long.\nRemark 2.8. If ` is ordered and special, we always get that {n\u22123, n\u22122, n\u22121} = J \u0304\nis long.

It follows from Proposition 3.6\n\u2217\nthat H(1)\n(M` ; Q) is an exterior face ring with respect to the following simplicial\ncomplex: let \u2206` be S\u0303(`) together with one extra vertex corresponding to Y which\ncones off X1 , . . . , Xn\u22124 .\n\u2217\nDenote the generators of H(1)\n(M`0 ; Q) by Xi0 and Y 0 .\nWe then have \u039bQ [\u2206` ] \u223c\n= \u039bQ [\u2206`0 ]. By Theorem 3.2, we get an isomorphism \u2206` \u223c\n=\n0\n\u2206` of simplicial complexes, that is, we have a bijection \u03c3 : {X1 , . . . , Xk , Y } \u2192\n{X10 , . . . , Xk0 , Y 0 } preserving simplices. Here k is the largest number \u2264 n \u2212 1 such\nthat {k, n} is short with respect to ` (and hence also with respect to `0 ). Note\nthat Y cones off the simplex X1 , . . . , Xn\u22124 , and if Xi0 with i \u2264 n \u2212 4 has the\nproperty that it is adjacent to Xj0 if and only if j \u2264 n \u2212 4, it is conceivable that\n\u03c3(Y ) = Xi0 . But then there has to be an Xl with \u03c3(Xl ) = Y 0 , and Xl is adjacent\nexactly to all Xj with j \u2264 n \u2212 4. Define \u03c3 0 : {X1 , . . . , Xk , Y } \u2192 {X10 , . . . , Xk0 , Y }\nby \u03c3 0 (Xs ) = \u03c3(Xs ) for s 6= l, \u03c3 0 (Xl ) = Xi0 and \u03c3 0 (Y ) = Y 0 . Then \u03c3 0 induces an\nisomorphism S\u0303(`) \u223c\n= S\u0303(`0 ), which by [6, Lm.3] implies \u1e60(`) = \u1e60(`0 ). Therefore `\n0\nand ` are in the same chamber.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.13. Type {1, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} is cohomologically rigid.\nProof. It is easy to see that there is only one chamber with A1n\u22125 = 0. More\ngenerally, we can have A1n\u22125 zero-, one- or two-dimensional, depending on whether\n{n, n \u2212 1} and {n, n \u2212 2} are short or long. But since {1, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} is long,\nwe get {n, n \u2212 2, 1} long, so there exist only three chambers up to permutation of\nspecial length vectors of type {1, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1}. Furthermore, these three chambers\nare distinguished by the first Betti number, see Lemma 3.8.\n\u0003\nA similar argument can be used to show that type {2, n\u22122, n\u22121} is cohomologically\nrigid, but the arguments using the annihilators Aik do not work for type {i, n\u22122, n\u2212\n1} with larger values of i. We therefore need different techniques, in particular we\nneed to get a better picture of the algebra generated by H 0 (M` ; Z) and H 1 (M` ; Z)\nwhich we denote by\n\u2217\nH(1)\n(M` ; Z).\n\nSince the homology of M` is free abelian, we necessarily get that\n\u2217\nH(1)\n(M` ; Z) \u223c\n=\n\n\u039bZ [A1 , . . . , Ak ]/I`\n\nwhere k is the first Betti number and I` is some ideal of \u039bZ [A1 , . . . , Ak ] whose\n\u2217\nelements have at least degree 2. We will see below that H(1)\n(M` ; Z) need not be a\nface ring in general, but I` is still well behaved enough to recover \u1e60(`).\n\n\fTHE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM FOR PLANAR POLYGON SPACES\n\n11\n\n4. The diffeomorphism type of certain planar polygon spaces\nLet ` = (`1 , . . . , `n ) be a generic ordered length vector. Given \u03b5 > 0, we can\nform a new length vector `0 = (\u03b5, `1 , . . . , `n ). If \u03b5 > 0 is sufficiently small, a set\nJ \u2282 {1, . . . , n + 1} is small with respect to `0 if and only if s(J \u2212 {1}) is small with\nrespect to `, where s : {2, . . . , n + 1} \u2192 {1, . . . , n} is given by s(i) = i \u2212 1.\nProposition 4.1. In the above situation, M`0 \u223c\n= M` \u00d7 S 1 , and the S 1 -factor\ncorresponds to rotating the first coordinate.\nProof. Let f : T n\u22121 \u2192 C be given by\nf (z1 , . . . , zn\u22121 )\n\n=\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n`i zi + `n .\n\ni=1\n\nThen M` = f \u22121 ({0}), and it is easy to see that 0 is a regular value of f . So\nthe normal bundle of M` in T n\u22121 is trivial, and we get M`0 is diffeomorphic to\nf \u22121 (S\u03b5 ), where S\u03b5 \u2282 C is the circle around 0 of radius \u03b5. So for \u03b5 > 0 small enough,\nwe get M`0 \u223c\n\u0003\n= M` \u00d7 S 1 .\nCorollary 4.2. If ` is special of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2} with n \u2265 5, then\nM` \u223c\n= M4 \u00d7 T n\u22125 , where M4 is the closed orientable surface of genus 4.\nProof. We have ` = (\u03b5, . . . , \u03b5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) is of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2}, provided\n\u03b5 > 0 is small enough. As there is only one chamber of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2}\nup to permutation by Lemma 3.11, the result follows by induction, the induction\nstart n = 5 is easily seen using the Betti numbers.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.3. If M` is disconnected, then M` \u223c\n= S 0 \u00d7 T n\u22123 .\nProof. It follows from Theorem 2.2 that we need {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} to be long with\nrespect to an ordered length vector for M` to be disconnected. Then there can\nonly be one chamber up to permutation with this property, and it is easy to see\nthat (\u03b5, . . . , \u03b5, 1, 1, 1) represents this chamber for sufficiently small \u03b5. The result\nnow follows by induction, starting with n = 3.\n\u0003\nThis corollary is well known, a proof can already be found in [17]. See also [15] and\n[8].\nNow consider a generic ordered length vector ` = (`1 , . . . , `n ) and for t \u2208 [0, `1 )\nlet `t = (`1 \u2212 t, `2 , . . . , `n\u22121 , `n + t). Then `t is also ordered, and a subset J \u2282\n{2, . . . , n \u2212 1} is short with respect to `t for any t if and only if it is short with\nrespect to `.\nWrite T n\u22122 = {(z2 , . . . , zn\u22121 ) | zi \u2208 S 1 } and define f : T n\u22122 \u00d7 [0, `1 \u2212 \u03b5] \u2192 R by\nf (z2 , . . . , zn\u22121 , t)\n\n=\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n2\n\n`i zi + `n + t\n\n\u2212 (`1 \u2212 t)2 ,\n\ni=2\n\nwhere \u03b5 > 0 is so small that J \u2282 {1, . . . , n} is small with respect to ``1 \u2212\u03b5 if and\nonly if s(J \u2212 {1}) is small with respect to `0 = (`2 , . . . , `n\u22121 , `n + `1 ).\nLemma 4.4.

To get a critical point of index\n0, we would need the set {1} to be long which is impossible. To get a critical point\nof index 1, we need {1, i} to be long for some i \u2208 {2, . . . , n \u2212 1}. In particular we\nget {1, n} to be long and M` is a (n \u2212 3)-sphere.\nTo get a critical point of index 2, we need {1, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} to be long. In particular,\nif ` is special, it is of type {1, n\u22122, n\u22121}, a cohomologically rigid type. By standard\ntransversality arguments we now get\nCorollary 4.7. Let ` be a special length vector of type different from {1, n\u22122, n\u22121}.\nThen M` has the same fundamental group as the cobordism W .\nTo understand the fundamental group of W , we start with\n(4)\n\n\u03c01 (M``1 \u2212\u03b5 ) \u223c\n= \u03c01 (M`0 ) \u00d7 Z,\n\nwhere `0 = (`2 , . . . , `n\u22121 , `n + `1 ) and analyze the critical points of index n \u2212 3 and\nn \u2212 4. Note that there can only be a critical point of index n \u2212 2 if {n} is long with\nrespect to `0 .\nBefore we consider the critical points of index n \u2212 3 and n \u2212 4 let us first observe\nthat the types of ` and `0 are closely related.\nLemma 4.8. Let ` be a special length vector and `0 = (`2 , . . . , `n\u22121 , `n + `1 ).\n(1) If ` is of type {i, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} with i \u2265 2, then `0 is special of type {i \u2212\n1, (n \u2212 1) \u2212 2, (n \u2212 1) \u2212 1}.\n(2) For n \u2265 6, if ` is of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1}, then `0 is special of type\n{(n \u2212 1) \u2212 4, (n \u2212 1) \u2212 3, (n \u2212 1) \u2212 1}.\nProof. Note that J \u2282 {2, . . . , n \u2212 1} is short with respect to ` if and only if J is\nshort with respect to `0 . The claim now follows easily.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.8 will allow us to determine the fundamental group of a special length\nvector via induction. We now want to set up basic objects for the fundamental\ngroup. The following Lemma is a useful tool for constructing actual loops in M` .\nLemma 4.9. Let ` = (`1 , . . . , `m ) be an ordered length vector with m \u2265 2 and let\np : T m \u2192 R2 be given by\np(z1 , . . . , zm )\n\n=\n\nm\nX\nj=1\n\n`j zj .\n\n\f16\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\nPm\u22121\nPm\u22121\nThen there exists a path \u03b3 : [`m \u2212 j=1 `j , `m + j=1 `j ] \u2192 T m such that p\u25e6\u03b3(t) =\n(t, 0) for all t, and if qj : T m \u2192 S 1 denotes projection to the j-th coordinate, we\nhave\n(1) qj \u25e6 \u03b3(t) \u2208\n/ {\u22121, 1} for at most two values of j \u2208 {1, . . . , m}.\n(2) Im(qj \u25e6 \u03b3(t)) \u2265 0 for j \u2264 n \u2212 1 and all t.\n(3) Im(qm \u25e6 \u03b3(t)) \u2264 0 for all t.\nHere Im(z) is the imaginary part of the complex number z \u2208 S 1 \u2282 C.\nProof. For n = 2 consider the map \u03b3\u0303(t) = (eit , 1) for t \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. Then Im(p\u03b3\u0303(t)) \u2265 0\nfor all t. So for every t we can find an angle \u03b8(t) \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, 0] such that p(eit , ei\u03b8(t) ) \u2208\nR. Reparametrizing this path gives \u03b3 for n = 2. Note that q2 (\u03b3(t)) = 1 at the\nendpoints of the interval, while q1 (\u03b3(t)) starts with \u22121 and ends with 1. For n > 2\nwe iterate this construction.\n\u0003\nAssume that ` is an ordered special length vector, so {n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} is a long\n\u2217\nset. We begin by choosing a basepoint in M` . Define z \u2217 = (z1\u2217 , . . . , zn\u22121\n) by zj = 1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfor j \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 4}, zn\u22123\n= \u22121 and zn\u22122\n, zn\u22121\nare chosen to give a closed linkage\n(zn = 1 here). This is possible, as {n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} is long. In fact, we have two\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nand zn\u22121\nso let us pick the one with Im(zn\u22122\n) > 0.\nchoices for zn\u22122\nWe will now assume that ` is of type {i, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} with i \u2264 n \u2212 4. For j \u2264 i \u2212 1,\ndefine \u03b3j : (S 1 , 1) \u2192 M` , z \u2217 ) by qj (\u03b3j (z)) = z, qk (\u03b3j (z)) = 1 for k \u2208 {1, . . . , n\u22124}\u2212\n{j}, and the linkage is closed by using Lemma 4.9 with (`n\u22123 , `n\u22122 , `n\u22121 ) together\nwith a small rotation, compare Figure 1. Here qk : M` \u2192 S 1 is projection to the\nk-th coordinate.\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22122\n\nn\u22123\n\nn\n\nFigure 1.\nThe fundamental group of T n\u22121 is Zn\u22121 generated by x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 , where each xj\nis generated by rotating the j-th coordinate once and keeping all other coordinates\nfixed. It is then clear that for j \u2264 i \u2212 1 we have i# ([\u03b3j ]) = xj \u2208 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ).\nIt is easy to see that [\u03b3j ] commutes with [\u03b3k ] for j, k \u2264 i \u2212 1.\nFor k \u2208 {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} we may have {k, n} is long or short. If it is short, define\n\u03b3k : (S 1 , 1) \u2192 (M` , z \u2217 ) by rotating the k-th coordinate. Using Lemma 4.9, this\ncan be done so that i# ([\u03b3k ]) = xk \u2208 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ). In fact, if j \u2264 i \u2212 1 is such that\n{j, k, n} is short, this can be done by keeping the j-th coordinate fixed. Note that\n{i, k, n} is already long by the type restriction. It is then not difficult to see that\n[\u03b3k ] commutes with [\u03b3j ], and in fact with every [\u03b3l ] for l \u2264 j.\nTo generate the fundamental group, we need to assign elements for j \u2208 {i, . . . , n\u22123}.\nWe will do this in the next section for i = 1, and use Lemma 4.8 and (4) to obtain\nthe general case.\n\n\fTHE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM FOR PLANAR POLYGON SPACES\n\n17\n\n5. Cohomology of special length vectors of type {1, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1}\nWe have already seen in Proposition 3.13 that type {1, n\u22122, n\u22121} is cohomologically\nrigid. However, knowing the cohomology and the fundamental group for these\npolygon spaces serves as an induction start for the types {i, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} with i \u2265 2.\nLet ` = (1, . . . , 1, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2) \u2208 Rn . Simple checking shows that ` is of type\n{1, n\u22122, n\u22121} and that {n\u22122, n} is long. On the other hand, `0 = (1, . . . , 1, n\u22122, n\u2212\n2, n \u2212 2) \u2208 Rn has disconnected planar polygon space, as {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} is long with\nrespect to `0 . The collection of length vectors `t = (1, . . . , 1, n\u22123+t, n\u22123+t, n\u22122)\nprovides a cobordism between M` and M`0 \u223c\n= T n\u22123 t T n\u22123 . Using Morse theory\nn\u22123\nn\u22123\n\u223c\nas in Section 4, we get that M` = T\n#T\n, a result which has been obtained\npreviously by Hausmann [11, Ex.2.10].\nLet us give generators for the fundamental group in the case n \u2265 5. For `0 we have\ntwo basepoints, z \u2217 from the last section and its complex conjugate z\u0304 \u2217 . It is easy to\nsee that z \u2217 and z\u0304 \u2217 are in different components. By the discussion above, we get\n\u03c01 (M`0 , z \u2217 ) \u223c\n= Zn\u22123 \u223c\n= \u03c01 (M`0 , z\u0304 \u2217 ),\nand we can represent generators by \u03b4j : (S 1 , 1) \u2192 (M`0 , z \u2217 ) and \u03b4\u0304j : (S 1 , 1) \u2192\n(M`0 , z\u0304 \u2217 ) for j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 3, which rotate the j-th coordinate, and keep the\nk-th coordinate fixed for k \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 3} \u2212 {j}. If we use \u03b4\u0304j as the complex\nconjugate of \u03b4j , we get aj = [\u03b4j ] \u2208 \u03c01 (M`0 , z \u2217 ) and bj = [\u03b4\u0304j ] \u2208 \u03c01 (M`0 , z\u0304 \u2217 ) with\ni# (aj ) = xj \u2208 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ) and i# (bj ) = \u2212xj \u2208 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ) for all j \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 3}.\nNow in M` we can find a path \u03b4 between z \u2217 and z\u0304 \u2217 , so we can obtain elements\nbj \u2208 \u03c01 (M` by bj = [\u03b4 \u2217 \u03b4\u0304j \u2217 \u03b4 \u22121 ] for j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 3. Note however that we have\nto slightly change \u03b4n\u22123 , namely, we cannot just fix all coordinates k \u2264 n \u2212 4, as\n{1, . . . , n\u22123, n} is not a short set with respect to `. But when we rotate the n\u22123-rd\ncoordinate, we change the n \u2212 4-th coordinate so that zn\u22122 and zn\u22121 can close the\nlinkage. The easiest way would be zn\u22124 = \u2212zn\u22123 , but then the n \u2212 4-th coordinate\nmakes a full turn. It is possible to avoid a full turn by choosing zn\u22124 = \u2212zn\u22123\nuntil zn\u22124 = \u22121 and then rotate backwards, compare Figure 2, where the second\nbar does a full turn while the first bar only does a half turn and then goes back at\na different speed.

For i \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} define Ai \u2208 H 1 (M` ; Z) \u223c\n= Hom(\u03c01 (M` ), Z) by\nAi (ai ) = 1 and Ai vanishes on the other generators. Here An\u22122 and An\u22121 are\nonly defined if {n \u2212 2, n}, respectively {n \u2212 1, n}, are short. Similarly we de\u2217\nfine Bi \u2208 H 1 (M` ; Z) for i \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 3}. Then H(1)\n(M` ; Z) is generated by\nA1 , . . . , An\u22121 , B1 , . . . , Bn\u22123 , and all relations except the first one hold by the fundamental group discussion above.\nTo see that the first relation holds, note that\nH \u2217 (T n\u22121 ; Z) \u223c\n= \u039bZ [X1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 ]\nwhere Xi \u2208 H 1 (T n\u22121 ; Z) satisfies Xi (xj ) = 1 for i = j and 0 for i 6= 0. Since\ni# (aj ) = xj and i# (bj ) = \u2212xj , we get i\u2217 (Xj ) = Aj \u2212 Bj for j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 3, and\ni\u2217 (Xk ) = Ak for k \u2208 {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1}. By Theorem 3.3 we get\n0\n\n=\n\ni\u2217 (X1 * * * Xn\u22123 )\n\n=\n\n(A1 \u2212 B1 ) * * * (An\u22123 \u2212 Bn\u22123 )\n\n=\n\nA1 * * * An\u22123 + (\u22121)n\u22123 B1 * * * Bn\u22123\n\nsince all mixed terms are zero. This shows the first relation. There cannot be\nany other relations for otherwise we get wrong Betti numbers.

First observe that in this case n \u2265 7. For if n = 5, {1, 2, 5}\nbeing short implies M` disconnected, and if n = 6 and {2, 3, 6} is short, ` has type\n{1, 4, 5}.\nSo if n \u2265 7 and {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n} is short with respect to `, but long with respect to\n``1 \u2212\u03b5 , then g has a critical point of index n \u2212 4 corresponding to J = {2, . . . , n \u2212\n1} \u2212 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3}.

We begin with the case that i \u2264 n \u2212 5, so \u03c01 (M` ) is a right-angled Artin\ngroup.\nAs above, we write G` = \u03c01 (M` ) and \u0393` for the graph determining G` . Then\n\u223c \u039bZ [F \u0393` ],\nH \u2217 (G` ; Z) =\nwhere F \u0393` is the flag-simplicial complex spanned by the graph \u0393` , see [3].

In particular, this is an exterior face ring, and\nwe write the generators as A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , Bi , . . . , Bn\u22123 . Furthermore, the inclusion\ni : M` \u2192 T n\u22121 factors through BG` , the classifying space for G` . We therefore get\na commutative diagram\nH \u2217 (T n\u22121 ; Z) \u223c\n= \u039bZ [X1 , .V. . , Xn\u22121 ]\nVVVV\nVVVV\u03c6\u2217\nVVVV\ni\u2217\nVVVV\nVV+\n\u000f\n\u2217\nH(1) (M` ; Z) o\nH \u2217 (G` ; Z) \u223c\n= \u039bZ [F \u0393` ]\nand by Proposition 6.1 we have\n\u03c6\u2217 (Xj )\n\u2217\n\n\u03c6 (Xj )\n\n=\n\nAj for j \u2208 {1, . . . , i \u2212 1, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1}\n\n= Aj \u2212 Bj for j \u2208 {i, . . . , n \u2212 3}.\n\n\f22\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\nFurthermore, the map H 1 (G` ; Z) \u2192 H 1 (M` ; Z) is an isomorphism, which implies\n\u2217\nthat H \u2217 (G` ; Z) \u2192 H(1)\n(M` ; Z) is surjective.\nTherefore we write A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , Bi , . . . , Bn\u22123 for the corresponding elements in\nH 1 (M` ; Z). By abuse of notation, we also write Xj = i\u2217 (Xj ) \u2208 H 1 (M` ; Z) for\nj = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, leading to Xj = Aj for j \u2208 {1, . . . , i \u2212 1, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} and\nXj = Aj \u2212 Bj for j \u2208 {i, . . . , n \u2212 3}.\n\u2217\nIt is clear that A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , Bi , . . . , Bn\u22123 generate H(1)\n(M` ; Z), and to show (7),\n\u2217\nwe have to show that H(1) (M` ; Z) is obtained by adding the relations given in the\nstatement.\nFirst note that XJ = 0 for J \u222a {n} long holds, as the Xj span the balanced\nsubalgebra, compare Proposition 3.3. If for such J we have J \u2229 {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} =\n6 \u2205,\nwe get AJ = 0, which is seen by considering the two cases J \u2229 {i, . . . , n \u2212 3} = \u2205 or\nnot. In the first case we simply get AJ = XJ = 0, and in the second case we have\nAj Am = 0 for j \u2208 {i, . . . , n \u2212 3}, m \u2265 n \u2212 2, as this relation holds in H \u2217 (G` ; Z). In\nparticular this implies AJ = 0.\nIf J \u2229 {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} = \u2205, observe that necessarily {i, . . . , n \u2212 3} \u2282 J by the type\nrestriction on `. An easy induction argument gives\nX{i,...,n\u22123}\n\n= A{i,...,n\u22123} + (\u22121)n\u22122\u2212i B{i,...,n\u22123}\n\nwhich implies\nAJ\u2212{i,...,n\u22123} (A{i,...,n\u22123} + (\u22121)n\u22122\u2212i B{i,...,n\u22123} )\n\n= XJ\n\nand the required relation. The last type of relations hold as they hold in H \u2217 (G` ; Z).\nSo we only have to show that we do not have to add any more relations. We will\ndo this by induction on i.\nThe case i = 1 follows easily from Proposition 5.1. For i \u2265 2 we use again the\ncobordism W between M` and M``1 \u2212\u03b5 . Since M``1 \u2212\u03b5 \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 M`0 , it is easy to see\nthat the result holds for ``1 \u2212\u03b5 (after shifting the indices of A and B), as it holds\nfor `0 by induction.\nFor t \u2208 [0, `1 \u2212 \u03b5], let Wt = g \u22121 ([t, \u221e)). If we start with t = `1 \u2212 \u03b5 and then\nlet t decrease, the cohomology of Wt changes everytime we slide over a critical\npoint of g. But notice that the homology of M` is free, with every element of \u1e60(`)\nproducing two generators by Theorem 2.2. By Lemma 4.6 this means that sliding\nover a critical point of g produces one extra summand of Z in H \u2217 (Wt ; Z) and two\nextra summands in H \u2217 (M`t ; Z).\nLet J \u2282 {2, . . . , n \u2212 1} be such that J is short with respect to `, but J \u222a {1} is\nlong. With K = {2, . . . , n \u2212 1} \u2212 J we get K \u222a {n} is short, but K \u222a {1, n} is long.\nLet t0 = g(qJ ) and \u03b4 > 0 so that g \u22121 ([t0 \u2212 \u03b4, t0 + \u03b4]) does not contain other critical\npoints2. Inductively we assume that (7) holds for `t0 +\u03b4 and we want to show that\nit holds for `t0 \u2212\u03b4 .\n\u2217\n\u2217\nFirst observe that H(1)\n(Wt ; Z) \u223c\n(M`t ; Z) for all regular values t. This is\n= H(1)\n\u2217\n\u2217\ntrue because the surjective map H (\u03c01 (M`t ); Z) \u2192 H(1)\n(M`t ; Z) factors through\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nH(1) (Wt ; Z) by Corollary 4.7, and H(1) (Wt ; Z) \u2192 H(1) (M`t ; Z) is injective by the\ndiscussion above.\n2By possibly changing ` slightly we can ensure that all critical points of g have different value.\n\n\fTHE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM FOR PLANAR POLYGON SPACES\n\n23\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nAlso H \u2217 (T n\u22121 ; Z) \u2192 H(1)\n(M`t ; Z) factors through H(1)\n(Wt ; Z), and we have an\n\u2217\nextra Z-summand corresponding to XK in H(1) (Wt0 \u2212\u03b4 ; Z). Note that 0 6= XK \u2208\n\u2217\nH(1)\n(M`t0 \u2212\u03b4 ; Z), as it is part of the balanced subalgebra by Proposition 3.3.\n\u2217\n\u2217\nTherefore H(1)\n(M`t0 \u2212\u03b4 ; Z) is obtained from H(1)\n(M`t0 +\u03b4 ; Z) by removing the relation XK , which is either of the form AK\u2212{i,...,n\u22123} (A{i,...,n\u22123} \u00b1 B{i,...,n\u22123} ) or AK .\nThis finishes the induction.\nWe now consider the case i = n \u2212 4 and {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n} long with respect to `.\nThe proof is by induction on n. For n = 5, there is only one case and M` \u223c\n= M2 ,\nthe orientable surface of genus 2. It is clear that the statement is correct then.

To be more precise, if {n \u2212 2, n} is short, we get an extra\ngenerator an\u22122 which commutes with ai provided that {i, n \u2212 2, n} is short, and\nhas no relations with any of the other generators. Let k \u2264 n \u2212 5 be the largest\nnumber with {k, n \u2212 2, n} short, and H1 be the corresponding HNN-extension of\nZn\u22125 \u00d7 S2 along Zk \u2282 Zn\u22125 . From the long exact sequence for an HNN-extension\n[1, Ch.VII.9], we get\nH \u2217 (H1 ; Z) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (Zn\u22125 \u00d7 S2 ; Z) \u2295 H \u2217\u22121 (Zk ; Z)\nas abelian groups, since the \u03b1-homomorphism in that sequence is zero as we have\na trivial HNN-extension and trivial coefficients. Now H 0 (Zk ; Z) \u2282 H 1 (H1 ; Z) is\ngenerated by An\u22122 , and the other generators of H \u2217\u22121 (Zk ; Z) correspond to AJ An\u22122\nwith J \u2282 {1, . . . , k}. There are no relations among these, as Zk \u00d7 Z, generated by\na1 , . . . , ak , an\u22122 is a retract of H1 . If {n \u2212 1, n} is long, we get H1 \u223c\n= \u1e20` and (8)\nfollows.\n\n\f24\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\nIf {n\u22121, n} is also short, then \u1e20` is a trivial HNN-extension of H1 along a subgroup\nZl generated by a1 , . . . , al , where l \u2264 n \u2212 5 is the largest number with {l, n \u2212 1, n}\nshort. Repeating the argument above gives (8) in this case as well.\nThe relations AJ for J \u2229{n\u22122, n\u22121} =\n6 \u2205 are contained in I` by the same argument\nas in the case i \u2264 n \u2212 5. It follows that all the relations listed in the statement of\nthe theorem are contained in I` and we have to show that no other relations are\nneeded. But the proof of this is identical to the argument used in the case i \u2264 n \u2212 5\nabove.\nIt remains to consider the case i = n \u2212 4 and {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n} short with respect to\n`. As mentioned above Proposition 6.3, we have n \u2265 7 in that case. Again all the\nrelations are contained in I` by an argument identical to the case i \u2264 n \u2212 5. Note\nthat the fundamental group is now again a right-angled Artin group.\nThe argument that no other relations are needed is similar to the arguments above,\nbut we have to be slightly careful with the induction step. The point is that\n{n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n} may or may not be short with respect to ``1 \u2212\u03b5 . If it is in long with\nrespect to ``1 \u2212\u03b5 , the statement holds for this length vector by the case considered\nabove, and the cobordism argument used in the case i \u2264 n \u2212 5 carries over and\nshows that the result also holds for `. Passing over the critical point corresponding\nto {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3} simply removes the relation An\u22124 An\u22123 + Bn\u22124 Bn\u22123 .\nIf n = 7, we necessarily have that {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n} is long with respect to ``1 \u2212\u03b5 ,\nso we get an induction start.

First observe that Ann(Am ; `) \u2282 hAm , An\u22122 , An\u22121 i by Theorem 6.4, so the\nrank can be at most 3, with equality if and only if {n\u22121, n} is short and {m, n\u22122, n}\nis long with respect to `.\nLet\nn\u22121\nn\u22123\nX\nX\ny =\nc j Aj +\ndj Bj\nj=1\n\nj=i\n\nand assume y \u2208 Ann(x; `). Note that if Am Ak = 0 for k \u2208 {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1}, we\nalso get Aj Ak = 0 for j \u2265 m, and ck \u2208 Z can be arbitrary. But if Am Ak 6= 0 for\nk \u2208 {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1}, we get ck = 0, since x does not have an nonzero Ak -coefficient.\nHence for k \u2265 n \u2212 2 we get Ak \u2208 Ann(x; `) if and only if Ak \u2208 Ann(Am ; `). We will\ntherefore now assume ck = 0 for k \u2208 {n \u2212 1, n \u2212 2}.\nFor j 6= m the coefficient of Am Aj in xy is am cj \u2212 aj cm , and the coefficient of\nAm Bj is am dj \u2212 bj cm . So for j < m we get cj = 0.

Then M y = 0 is equivalent to the the coefficients\nof Am Aj and Am Bj for j = m + 1, . . . , n \u2212 3 in xy are zero. As the rank of ker M\nis clearly 1, we get the desired result.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.7. For i \u2264 n \u2212 4, type {i, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} is cohomologically rigid.\nProof.

Notice that \u03c6\u0304(Aj + aj Tn\u22121 ) =\n\u03c6\u0304(Aj ) + aj A0n\u22121 , so we can choose the aj and bj with\n\u03c8(hAi , . . . , An\u22123 , Bi , . . . , Bn\u22123 i) \u2282\n\n0\nhA01 , . . . , A0n\u22122 , Bi0 , . . . , Bn\u22123\ni.\n\nRepeating the argument with Tn\u22122 , we can assume that\n\u03c6\u0304(hAi , . . . , An\u22123 , Bi , . . . , Bn\u22123 i) \u2282\n\n0\nhA01 , . . . , A0n\u22123 , Bi0 , . . . , Bn\u22123\ni.\n\nNow observe that for j \u2208 {i, . . . , n \u2212 3} we get\nhAj , An\u22122 , An\u22121 , Bi , . . . , Bn\u22123 i\n\n\u2282 Ann(Aj ; `)\n\nhBj , Ai , . . . , An\u22121 i\n\n\u2282 Ann(Bj ; `),\n\nso the ranks are at least 3, and the rank equal to 3 implies An\u22122 = 0.

To do\nthis, it is enough to show that \u03c6\u0304 sends K` to K`0 . We already know that \u03c6\u0304 sends I`\nto I`0 , so we only have to consider the relations AJ and (AB)J for J \u2282 {1, . . . , n\u22123}\nwith J \u222a{n} long.

But then both \u03c6\u0304(AJ 0 ) * \u03c6\u0304(A{i,...,n\u22123} )\nand \u03c6\u0304(AJ 0 ) * \u03c6\u0304(B{i,...,n\u22123} ) are contained in K`0 .\nThis shows that \u03c6\u0304 sends K` to K`0 . Repeating the argument with \u03c6\u0304\u22121 we get a\nhomomorphism\n0\n\u03c8\u0304 \u2217 : \u039bZ [A01 , . . . , A0n\u22121 , Bi0 , . . . , Bn\u22123\n]/K`0 \u2192 \u039bZ [A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , Bi , . . . , Bn\u22123 ]/K` .\n\nwith \u03c8\u0304 \u2217 \u25e6 \u03c8\u0304 = id and \u03c8\u0304 \u25e6 \u03c8\u0304 \u2217 = id on degree 1 elements.

Cohomology of special length vectors of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1}\nWe now want to show that type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1} is also cohomologically rigid.\nWe start by determining the fundamental group for such special length vectors. As\nin the case of special length vectors of type {i, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} we want to begin by\nconstructing certain elements of the fundamental group.\nFirst we write \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ) \u223c\n= Zn\u22121 as generated by x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 , where each xi is represented by a rotation along the i-th coordinate, while keeping the other coordinates\nfixed.\n\n\f28\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nDefine a basepoint z \u2217 = (z1\u2217 , . . . , zn\u22121\n) \u2208 M` by z1\u2217 , . . . , zn\u22125\n, zn\u22122\n= 1, zn\u22121\n= \u22121\n\u2217\n\u2217\n1\nand choose zn\u22124 , zn\u22123 \u2208 S so that we have a closed linkage.\n\nAs in Section 5, define \u03b3j : (S 1 , 1) \u2192 (M` , z \u2217 ) for j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 5 so that i# [\u03b3j ] =\nxj \u2208 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ). Also, if {n \u2212 1, n} is short, we can define \u03b3n\u22121 : (S 1 , 1) \u2192 (M` , z \u2217 )\nwith i# [\u03b3n\u22121 ] = xn\u22121 . It is also easy to see that [\u03b3j ], [\u03b3k ] commute for j, k \u2264 n \u2212 5,\nand [\u03b3n\u22121 ] commutes with [\u03b3j ], provided that {j, n \u2212 1, n} is short.\nProposition 7.1. Let n \u2265 5 and ` a special length vector of type {n\u22124, n\u22123, n\u22121}.\nThen the fundamental group of M` has a presentation with generating set\n{a1 , . . . , an\u22121 , bn\u22124 , bn\u22123 , bn\u22122 }\nsubject to the relations\n[an\u22124 , bn\u22124 ][an\u22123 , bn\u22123 ][an\u22122 , bn\u22122 ]\n[aj , ak ] if {j, k, n} is short\n[aj , bk ] if j \u2264 n \u2212 5, k \u2208 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2}\nan\u22121\n\nif {n \u2212 1, n} is long.\n\nFurthermore, the homomorphism i# : \u03c01 (M` ) \u2192 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ) induced by inclusion\nsends aj to xj for j \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 5} and also for j = n \u2212 1, provided that {n \u2212 1, n}\nis short. For j \u2208 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2} we also get that i# (aj ), i# (bj ) is contained\nin the subgroup generated by xn\u22124 , xn\u22123 , xn\u22122 .\nRemark 7.2. One could ask for a sharpening of Proposition 7.1 by determining\nthe image of aj and bj for j \u2208 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2} by giving precise generators.\nHowever, we do not need this information below.\nProof of Proposition 7.1. The proof is by induction on n. For n = 5, a Betti number\nargument shows that M` \u223c\n= M3 , the orientable surface of genus 3. Furthermore,\n{4, 5} is long, so the statement of the proposition holds.\nFor n > 5, note that `0 = (`2 , . . . , `n\u22121 , `n + `1 ) is of type {n \u2212 5, n \u2212 4, n \u2212 2},\nand we get a cobordism W from Lemma 4.4 between M` and S 1 \u00d7 M`0 , and the\nproposition holds for ` \u0304 = (\u03b5, `2 , . . . , `n\u22121 , `n + `1 \u2212 \u03b5). As in the proof of Theorem\n6.1, we can get one extra generator, which is then represented by \u03b3n\u22121 above. This\nshows that the statement about i# : \u03c01 (M` ) \u2192 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ) holds.\nFurthermore, for every two element subset {i, j} \u2282 {2, . . . , n\u22121} with {i, j, n} short\nwith respect to ` and long with respect to ` \u0304 we get a commutator [ai , aj ]. Notice\nthat since ` and ` \u0304 are of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1}, we necessarily get i \u2264 n \u2212 5 and\nj = n \u2212 1 in this situation.\n\u0003\nRemark 7.3. If {n \u2212 1, n} is long, the fundamental group is simply Zn\u22125 \u00d7 S3 ,\nwhere S3 = \u03c01 (M3 ). In fact, it is easy to see that there is only one chamber of type\n{n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1} up to permutation with the additional property that {n \u2212 1, n}\nis long, compare Lemma 3.11. More precisely, one shows that for this chamber we\nget M` \u223c\n= T n\u22125 \u00d7 M3 by an argument similar to Corollary 4.2.\nFor this reason, we can assume that {n\u22121, n} is short with respect to `. In this case\nwe get that the fundamental group of M` is a trivial HNN-extension of Z n\u22125 \u00d7 S3\nalong the subgroup Zk generated by a1 , . . . , ak , where k is the maximal number\nlesser equal to n \u2212 5 such that {k, n \u2212 1, n} is short. In case there is no such k (that\nis, k = 0), we simply get the free product of Zn\u22125 \u00d7 S3 with Z.\n\n\fTHE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM FOR PLANAR POLYGON SPACES\n\n29\n\nCorollary 7.4. Let ` be special of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1} with {n \u2212 1, n} short\nand n \u2265 5.

From the long exact sequence for an HNN-extension [1, Ch.VII.9], we get\nH \u2217 (\u03c01 (M` ); Z) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (Zn\u22125 \u00d7 S3 ; Z) \u2295 H \u2217\u22121 (Zk ; Z)\nas abelian groups, since the \u03b1-homomorphism in that sequence is zero as we have a\ntrivial HNN-extension and trivial coefficients. Now H 0 (Zk ; Z) \u2282 H 1 (\u03c01 (M` ); Z) is\ngenerated by An\u22121 , and the other generators of H \u2217\u22121 (Zk ; Z) correspond to AJ An\u22121\nwith J \u2282 {1, . . . , k}. There are no relations among these, as Zk \u00d7 Z, generated by\na1 , . . . , ak , an\u22121 is a retract of \u03c01 (M` ).\nThe relations for I that do not involve An\u22121 hold, as they hold in\nH \u2217 (Zn\u22125 \u00d7 S3 ; Z) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (T n\u22125 ; Z) \u2297 H \u2217 (M3 ; Z),\nand the relations involving An\u22121 hold, as (Zn\u22125\u2212k \u00d7 S3 ) \u2217 Z is a retract of \u03c01 (M` ).\nThis finishes the proof.\n\u0003\nProposition 7.5. Let ` be special of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1} with n \u2265 5. Then\n\u223c \u039bZ [A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , Bn\u22124 , Bn\u22123 , Bn\u22122 ]/I`\nH \u2217 (M` ; Z) =\n(1)\n\nwhere I` is the ideal generated by\nAJ\n\nfor\n\nJ \u222a {n} long with J \u2229 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2} = \u2205\n\nAi Aj\n\nfor\n\ni, j \u2208 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2}\n\nBi Bj\n\nfor\n\ni, j \u2208 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2}\n\nAi B j\n\nfor\n\ni, j \u2208 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2} with i 6= j\n\nAn\u22121 Aj\n\nfor\n\nj \u2264 n \u2212 2 with {j, n \u2212 1, n} long\n\nAn\u22121 Bj\n\nfor\n\nj \u2208 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2}\n\nAn\u22122 Bn\u22122 \u2212 An\u22123 Bn\u22123\n\nand\n\nAn\u22123 Bn\u22123 \u2212 An\u22124 Bn\u22124\n\nProof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 6.4, and by induction over n.\nFor n = 5, we get M` \u223c\n= M3 and the result is obvious.\nFor n > 5 we have the diagram\nH \u2217 (T n\u22121 ; Z) \u223c\n= \u039bZ [X1 , U. . . , Xn\u22121 ]\nUUUU\nUUUU\u03c6\u2217\nUUUU\ni\u2217\nUUUU\nU*\n\u000f\n\u2217\nH(1) (M` ; Z) o\nH \u2217 (\u03c01 (M` ); Z)\n\n\f30\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\n\u2217\nFurthermore, the map H \u2217 (\u03c01 (M` ); Z) \u2192 H(1)\n(M` ; Z) induced by the classifying\nmap is surjective and an isomorphism for \u2217 \u2264 1. Therefore\n\u223c \u039bZ [A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , Bn\u22124 , Bn\u22123 , Bn\u22122 ]/I`\nH \u2217 (M` ; Z) =\n(1)\n\nfor some ideal I` , and the relations listed in the statement, except the AJ relations,\nare in I` by Corollary 7.4. To see that AJ for J \u222a {n} long with J \u2229 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212\n3, n \u2212 2} = \u2205 also holds, note that by the statement on i# in Proposition 7.1 we\nget i\u2217 (Xj ) = Aj for j \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 5}, and also for j = n \u2212 1 if {n \u2212 1, n} is short.\nHence the relation AJ holds by Proposition 3.3.\nWe therefore have to show that no other relations hold. Let W be the cobordism\nfrom Lemma 4.4 between M` and M``1 \u2212\u03b5 . Since M``1 \u2212\u03b5 \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 M`0 , the result\nholds for ``1 \u2212\u03b5 . As in the proof of Theorem 6.4, whenever we slide over a critical\npoint (going from M``1 \u2212\u03b5 to M` ) we will remove one relation. But note that\nthe critical points of g correspond to subsets J \u2282 {2, . . . , n \u2212 1} which are short\nwith respect to `, but with {1} \u222a J long with respect to `. This means that\nJ \u0303 = {2, . . . , n \u2212 1} \u2212 J satisfies J \u0303 \u222a {n} is short with respect to ` while it is long\n \u0303\nwith respect to ``1 \u2212\u03b5 . It follows that J \u0303 \u2229 {n \u2212 2, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 4} = \u2205 and {n \u2212 1} \u2208 J,\n \u0303\nfor otherwise we have J \u222a {n} short or long with respect to both ` and ``1 \u2212\u03b5 (recall\nthey both have the same type). In particular, AJ \u0303 is zero in the cohomology of\n``1 \u2212\u03b5 , but not in the cohomology of `.\n\u0003\nTheorem 7.6. Type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1} is cohomologically rigid.\nBefore we start the proof, recall the annihilators defined in Section 6. The following\nLemma is proven analogously to Lemmata 6.5 and 6.6.\nLemma 7.7. Let ` be a special length vector of type {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1} with\n{n \u2212 1, n} short. Then\nAnn(`)\n\n=\n\nhAn\u22121 i.\n\nFurthermore, for m \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 5} and am , . . . , an\u22122 , bn\u22124 , . . . , bn\u22122 \u2208 Z with\nam 6= 0, let\nx\n\n=\n\nn\u22122\nX\n\nn\u22122\nX\n\naj Aj +\n\nj=m\n\nbj Bj ,\n\nj=n\u22124\n\nthen\n\u001a\nrank Ann(x; `) = rank Ann(Am ; `)\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\nAm An\u22121 =\n6 0\nAm An\u22121 = 0\n\nProof of Theorem 7.6. Let `, `0 be two ordered special length vectors of type {n \u2212\n4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1} with isomorphic cohomology rings. Then there is an isomorphism\n0\n0\n\u03c6 : \u039bZ [A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , Bn\u22124 , . . . , Bn\u22122 ]/I` \u2192 \u039bZ [A01 , . . . , A0n\u22121 , Bn\u22124\n, . . . , Bn\u22122\n]/I`0\n\nwith I` , I`0 as in Proposition 7.5. As \u03c6 sends Ann(`) to Ann(`0 ) we get \u03c6(An\u22121 ) =\n\u00b1A0n\u22121 by Lemma 7.7. Also, by the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 6.7,\nand using Lemma 7.7, we can assume that\n\u03c6(hAn\u22124 , . . . , An\u22122 , Bn\u22124 , . . . , Bn\u22122 i) \u2282\n\n0\n0\nhA0n\u22124 , . . . , A0n\u22122 , Bn\u22124\n, . . . , Bn\u22122\ni.\n\nThe same also holds for \u03c6\u22121 , and we get an isomorphism\n\u03c8 : \u039bZ [A1 , . . . , An\u22125 , An\u22121 ]/I \u0303` \u2192 \u039bZ [A01 , . . . , A0n\u22125 , A0n\u22121 ]/I \u0303`0\n\n\fTHE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM FOR PLANAR POLYGON SPACES\n\n31\n\nwhere I \u0303` is the ideal generated by AJ , where J \u2282 {1, . . . , n \u2212 5, n \u2212 1} satisfies\nJ \u222a {n} is long with respect to `, and I \u0303`0 is the analogous ideal for `0 .\nDenote by S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`) the full subcomplex of S\u0303(`) containing {i} for i \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212\n5, n \u2212 1}, that is, it consists of those subsets J \u2208 \u1e60(`) for which J \u2229 {1, . . . , n \u2212\n5, n \u2212 1} =\n6 \u2205, but J \u2229 {n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2} = \u2205. Observe that \u03c8 is an isomorphism\nbetween exterior face rings\n\u03c8 : \u039bZ [S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`)] \u2192 \u039bZ [S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`0 )]\nso by Theorem 3.2 we get a permutation \u03c3 : {1, . . . , n\u22125, n\u22121} \u2192 {1, . . . , n\u22125, n\u2212\n1} inducing a bijection S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`) \u2192 S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`0 ). By [6, Lm.3] we3 get S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`) =\nS\u0303 (n\u22121) (`0 ). The set \u1e60(`) \u2212 S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`) is completely determined by ` being of type\n{n \u2212 4, n \u2212 3, n \u2212 1}, so \u1e60(`) = \u1e60(`0 ), which means that ` and `0 are in the same\nchamber.\n\u0003\nProof of Walker's Conjecture. Let ` and `0 be generic length vectors with isomorphic graded cohomology rings H \u2217 (M` ; Z) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (M`0 ; Z). By Theorem 2.4 we get\nthat they are in the same chamber up to permutation, if one of them is normal. The\nsame is true if the polygon spaces are disconnected. Therefore we can assume that\nboth ` and `0 are special. By Corollary 3.9 they have the same type. By Remark\n2.8, Theorems 3.12, 6.7 and 7.6, and Lemma 3.11 we get that ` and `0 are in the\nsame chamber up to permutation.\n\u0003\nRemark 7.8. Note that we have used Theorem 3.2 with R = Z in all cases except\nin Theorem 3.12, where we used R = Q. The case R = Z can be reduced to\nR = Z/2, so one may ask if we can obtain cohomology with Z-coefficients also for\ntype {n \u2212 3, n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1} and use Theorem 3.2 with R = Z/2 throughout.\nLet us indicate that this is indeed possible. For n = 4 with {1, 2, 3} long, it is easy\nto see that M` \u223c\n= S 1 and the homomorphism i# : \u03c01 (M` ) \u2192 \u03c01 (T 4 ) is trivial. For\nn \u2265 5, we can always keep the first n \u2212 4 bars fixed at 1 to produce an element\nb \u2208 \u03c01 (M` ) with i# b = 0 \u2208 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ). Using the techniques above for calculating\nthe fundamental group, it is now easy to see that the fundamental group is a rightangled Artin group\n*\n\u03c01 (M` )\n\n=\n\na1 , . . . , an\u22121 , b\n\nak\n[ai , b]\n[ai , aj ]\n\n+\nfor {k, n} long,\nfor i \u2264 n \u2212 4,\n,\nfor {i, j, n} short\n\nand the ai are mapped to xi under i# , provided that {i, n} is short. As before, we\nget for the cohomology\n\u2217\nH(1)\n(M` ; Z) \u223c\n= \u039bZ [A1 , . . . , An\u22121 , B]/I`\n\nwhere I` is the ideal generated by AJ for J \u222a {n} long, and Aj B for j \u2265 n \u2212 3.\nNotice that since i# b = 0 \u2208 \u03c01 (T n\u22121 ), we get an exterior face ring. Theorem 3.2\ncan now be applied as in Theorem 3.12, but with Z/2-coefficients.\n3Lemma 3 of [6] is not stated for S\u0303 (n\u22121) (`), but the proof works identically for this set as well.\n\n\f32\n\nDIRK SCH\u00dcTZ\n\nReferences\n[1] K.
