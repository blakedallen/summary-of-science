While detailed modeling is necessary for elucidating and optimizing the transport\ncharacteristics of such devices, in this paper we embrace an\nalternative-minimal approach [2]. With the motivation of exploring the fundamentals of quantum transport in correlated\nelectron systems, we focus on the dynamics of \"impurity\nmodels\" [3], consisting a small subsystem (molecule, quantum dot) interacting with two electronic reservoirs, driven to\na nonequilibrium steady-state by a DC voltage bias. While\nthe impurity object includes only few degrees of freedom, it\nincorporates many-body interactions, making exact analytical\nsolutions generally inaccessible. Among the standard models\nconsidered in this context are the single impurity Anderson\nmodel (SIAM), combining a single electronic level with up\nto two interacting electrons coupled to metallic leads [4], and\nthe spinless two-level Anderson model (2LAM), consisting a\nspinless dot with two interacting (HOMO and LUMO) levels\nhybridized with electronic reservoirs [5\u20137].\nEven in the steady-state limit, the analysis of such nonequilibrium systems turns out to be intricate, and analytical solutions are lacking, see e.g., [8]. Various numerical simulation approaches have been developed, including perturbative\ntreatments [9] and renormalization-group techniques [3, 10].\nEven more difficult is the description of the time evolution of\nthe system from some initial preparation towards steady-state\nunder a finite voltage-bias. The transient nonequilibrium dynamics of the Anderson model, and its variants, has been recently simulated using path-integral Monte-Carlo simulations\n[11\u201313] and influence-functional methods [14, 15]. Several\nfactors should be considered for fully understanding the dynamics of such models: (i) the finite external bias, driving the\nsystem out-of-equilibrium, (ii) electron-electron interaction,\n\nor more generally many-body interactions, (iii) band-structure\neffects, and (iv) the device temperature. The combined effects\nof these four ingredients on the time evolution of a nanoscale\nobject have not yet been fully understood [16].\nOur objective here is to follow the dynamics of simple\nnanoscale junctions employing the SIAM and the 2LAM\nmodels as prototypes. We explore the role of the temperature and interaction strength in determining both the short\ntime evolution of the system and its steady-state properties. For achieving this task we adopt the recently developed\nnumerically-exact influence functional path integral (INFPI)\ntechnique [15]. This method relies on the observation that in\nout-of-equilibrium (and finite temperature) cases bath correlations have a finite range, allowing for their truncation beyond a\nmemory time dictated by the voltage-bias and the temperature.\nTaking advantage of this fact, an iterative-deterministic timeevolution scheme has been developed where convergence with\nrespect to the memory length can in principle be reached. As\nconvergence is facilitated at large bias, the method is well\nsuited for the description of the real-time dynamics of singlemolecule devices driven to a steady-state via interaction with\nbiased leads. In this respect the INFPI approach is complementary to methods applicable predominantly close to equilibrium, e.g., numerical renormalization group techniques [3].\nThe principles of the INFPI approach have been detailed\nin Ref. [15], where it has been adopted for investigating, at\nzero temperature, dissipation effects in the nonequilibrium\nspin-fermion model, and the population dynamics in a correlated quantum dot, investigating the Anderson model. The\nfocus of the present study are transport characteristics of correlated nonequilibrium models, thus we introduce the INFPI\napproach in this context only. We demonstrate that the method\ncan feasibility treat various impurity models. In particular, the\npopulation dynamics and the electron current in the SIAM and\nthe 2LAM models are simulated at nonzero temperatures.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe\nthe INFPI method in the context of quantum transport junc-\n\n\f2\ntions. The nonequilibrium dynamics of the Anderson dot is\nstudied in Sec. III. The spinless two-level Anderson model is\ndiscussed in Sec. IV. Some conclusions follow in Sec. V.\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic representation of the two models considered in\nthis work: (top panel) the single impurity Anderson model with onsite repulsion terms on the dot; (bottom panel) the spinless two-level\nAnderson model, with two electronic levels allowing for up to two\ninteracting electrons.\n\npresent analysis to the special form\n1\nH1 = U [n1 n2 \u2212 (n1 + n2 )].\n2\n\nHere ni are occupation number operators for the subsystem\nwith U as an interaction parameter. The states '1' and '2' may\neither symbolize the spin orientation, or count the (subsystem)\nelectronic states. This structure allows for the elimination of\nH1 via the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation [17].\nIn particular, in the Anderson model [see Eq. (17)] H1 accounts for the double occupancy energy cost on the dot. Similarly, in the 2LAM [Eq. (27)] H1 constitutes the repulsion\nenergy between electrons occupying the dot levels.\nOur objective here is to calculate the dynamics of a\nquadratic operator \u00c2, either given by subsystem or baths degrees of freedom. This can be done by studying the Heisenberg equation of motion of an exponential operator e\u03bb\u00c2 , with\n\u03bb a variable that is taken to vanish at the end of the calculation,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\nTr \u03c1(0)eiHt e\u03bb\u00c2 e\u2212iHt .\n\u03bb\u21920 \u2202\u03bb\n\nh\u00c2(t)i = Tr(\u03c1\u00c2) = lim\n\nII.\n\nGENERAL FORMULATION\n\nWe detail here the INFPI method in the context of quantum transport models. A more general presentation, dealing\nwith both transport and dissipation in nonequilibrium open\nsystems, is given in Ref. [15]. The generic setup considered includes a quantum impurity (subsystem) coupled to two\nmetal leads (reservoirs) driven to a non-equilibrium steadystate through the application of a finite DC voltage-bias. The\nquantum impurity may be realized by a magnetic impurity,\ndouble quantum dots, or a multi-state quantum dot. The electrodes are modeled by two fermionic continua. System-bath\ncouplings allow for a particle transfer between the impurity\nand the leads. We assume that the reservoirs' electrons are\nnon-interacting, and include many-body interactions within\nthe subsystem only, accounting for an additional energy cost\nfor double occupancy. For a schematic representation see Fig.\n1. Our generic Hamiltonian is given by\nH = H0 + H 1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H0 includes the exactly solvable noninteracting part\ncombining the two leads, the noninteracting part of the subsystem, and impurity-bath hybridization terms. Many body\ninteractions are incorporated into H1 , and we confine our\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03c1 is the total density matrix and the trace is performed\nover subsystem and reservoirs degrees of freedom. For simplicity, we assume that at the initial time (t = 0) the dot and\nthe baths are decoupled, and that the baths are prepared in a\nnonequilibrium biased state. The time-zero total density matrix is therefore given by the product state \u03c1(0) = \u03c1S (0) \u2297\n\u03c1L \u2297\u03c1R . We proceed and factorize the time evolution operator\nusing a standard breakup, eiHt = (eiH\u03b4t )N , further assuming\n\u0001\nthe Trotter decomposition eiH\u03b4t \u2248 eiH0 \u03b4t/2 eiH1 \u03b4t eiH0 \u03b4t/2 .\nThe many-body term H1 can be eliminated by introducing\nauxiliary Ising variables s = \u00b1 via the Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation [17],\ne\u00b1iH1 \u03b4t =\n\n1 X \u2212s\u03ba\u00b1 (n2 \u2212n1 )\ne\n.\n2 s\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03ba\u00b1 = \u03ba\u2032 \u2213 i\u03ba\u2032\u2032 , \u03ba\u2032 = sinh\u22121 [sin(\u03b4tU/2)]1/2 , \u03ba\u2032\u2032 =\nsin\u22121 [sin(\u03b4tU/2)]1/2 .

This argument\nimplies the following (non-unique) breakup [15]\n\nwhere each element in the product, besides the first one, is\ngiven by the ratio between truncated IF,\n\nIs (sk , sk+1 , ..., sk+Ns \u22121 ) =\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nI(s\u00b1\nk , sk+1 , ..., sk+Ns \u22121 )\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nI(s\u00b1\nk , sk+1 , ..., sk+Ns \u22122 )\n\n, (8)\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 \u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 \u00b1\n\u00b1\nI(s\u00b1\n1 , s2 , ...sN ) \u2243 I(s1 , s2 , ..., sNs )Is (s2 , s3 , ..., sNs +1 )...\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00d7Is (s\u00b1\nN \u2212Ns +1 , sN \u2212Ns +2 , ..., sN ),\n\n\u00b1\nI(s\u00b1\nk , ..., sk+Ns \u22121 ) =\n\n(7) with\n\n1\n\n2\n\nh\ni\n+\n+ iH0 (k\u22121)\u03b4t \u03bb\u00c2 \u2212iH0 (k\u22121)\u03b4t\n\u2212\n\u2212\nTr\n\u03c1(0)G\n(s\n)...G\n(s\n)e\ne\ne\nG\n(s\n)...G\n(s\n)\n.\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nk+N\n\u22121\nk\nk\nk+N\n\u22121\n2Ns\ns\ns\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2020\niH0 \u03b4t/2 H+ (s+\nk ) eiH0 \u03b4t/2\nand G\u2212 = G+\n.\nHere G+ (s+\n)\n=\ne\ne\nk\nWe now define the following multi-time object,\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nR(s\u00b1\nk+1 , sk+2 , ..., sk+Ns \u22121 ) \u2261\nX\n\u00b1 \u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nI(s\u00b1\n1 , s2 , ..., sNs )Is (s2 , s3 , ..., sNs +1 )...\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\ns\u00b1\n1 ,s2 ,...,sk\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00d7Is (s\u00b1\nk , sk+1 , ..., sk+Ns \u22121 ),\n\n(10)\n\nand time-evolve it by multiplying it with the subsequent truncated IF, then summing over the intermediate variables,\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nR(s\u00b1\nk+2 , sk+3 , ..., sk+Ns ) =\nX\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nR(s\u00b1\nk+1 , sk+2 , ..., sk+Ns \u22121 )Is (sk+1 , sk+2 , ..., sk+Ns ).\ns\u00b1\nk+1\n\n(11)\nSummation over the internal variables results in the time local\nexpectation value, e.g., at tk we get\nX\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nhe\u03bb\u00c2(tk ) i =\nR(s\u00b1\nk+2\u2212Ns , sk+3\u2212Ns , ..., sk ).(12)\n\u00b1\ns\u00b1\nk+2\u2212Ns ,...,sk\n\nThis procedure is repeated for several values of small \u03bb. Taking the numerical derivative with respect to \u03bb, the expectation\nvalue of the operator of interest, at a particular time, is retrieved, h\u00c2(tk )i.\nThe truncated influence functional in Eq. (9) is the core\nof our calculation. Since it includes only quadratic operators\n[18], it can be exactly calculated utilizing the trace formula\nfor fermions [19],\nTr[eM1 eM2 ...eMp ] = det[1 + em1 em2 ...emp ].\n\n(13)\n\nHere mp is a single particle operator corresponding to a\nP\n\u2020\nc\u2020i (cj ) are\nquadratic operator Mp =\ni,j (mp )i,j ci cj .\n\n(9)\n\nfermionic creation (annihilation) operators. At zero temperature we can formally write Eq. (9) as\nI \u221d h0|eM1 eM2 ...eMp |0i = det[em1 em2 ...emp ]occ , (14)\nwhere |0i is the initial (zero temperature) state of the total system and the determinant is carried over occupied states only.\nAt finite temperatures Eq. (9) can be represented by\nI \u221d Tr[eM1 eM2 ...eMp (\u03c1L \u2297 \u03c1R \u2297 \u03c1S (0))],\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u03b1 corresponds to the time-zero density matrix of the\n\u03b1 = L, R fermion bath. \u03c1S (0) denotes the subsystem initial\ndensity matrix. Assuming that these density operators can be\nwritten in an exponential form, eM , with M a quadratic operator [18], application of the trace formula leads to\n\u0003\n\u0002\nI = Tr eM1 eM2 ...eMp (\u03c1L \u2297 \u03c1R \u2297 \u03c1S (0))\nn\n= det [IL \u2212 fL ] \u2297 [IR \u2212 fR ] \u2297 [IS \u2212 fS ].\no\n(16)\n+ em1 em2 ...emp [fL \u2297 fR \u2297 fS ] .\nThe matrices I\u03b1 and IS are the identity matrices for the \u03b1\nspace and for the subsystem, respectively. The functions fL\nand fR are the bands electrons' energy distribution, f\u03b1 =\n[e\u03b2\u03b1 (\u01eb\u2212\u03bc\u03b1 ) + 1]\u22121 , with the chemical potential \u03bc\u03b1 and temperature \u03b2\u03b1 . The subsystem (initial distribution) fS may vary,\ndepending on the particular problem. For example, for the\nAnderson model (Sec. III) we consider a dot initially empty.\nIn what follows we apply the INFPI method on two quantum impurity models, of interest in the context of molecular\nelectronics, the SIAM and the 2LAM, see Fig. 1, with minimal modifications to the simulation code. Since both models\nadmit the form (1)-(2), we need only to separately construct\nthe particular (single particle) noninteracting Hamiltonian H0\n\n\f4\nand the operator of choice \u00c2. With this in hand, we can readily calculate the truncated IF of Eq. (9) and the ratio in Eq. (8)\nusing the trace formula. We then time evolve the multi-time\nR structure following Eq. (11). The time evolution of the\noperator of interest is acquired using Eq. (12). We note that\nthis iterative algorithm can be feasibly adopted for simulating other models, including correlated multi-site chains with\nquartic interactions. However, the present implementation is\nlimited by efficiency to models with two correlated sites [20].\nBefore discussing numerical results, we point out the different sources of errors in our calculations, and explain how\nto control and overcome them. There are three sources of\nsystematic error within our approach. (i) Bath discretization error. The electronic reservoirs are explicitly included\nin our simulations, and we use bands extending from \u2212D to\nD with a finite number of states per bath per spin (Ls ). This\nstands in contrast to standard approaches where a wide-band\nlimit is assumed and analytical expressions for the reservoirs\nGreen's functions are adopted [11, 12, 14]. As we show below (see Fig. 6), by increasing the number of bath states Ls\nwe can unequivocally reach convergence, typically employing Ls \u2265 100 states. We also note that while it is sometimes\nadvantageous to encompass the leads' effect into self energies terms, complex dispersion relations can be easily handled\nwithin our method. (ii) Trotter error. The time discretization\nerror, order of (U \u03b4t)2 , originates from the approximate factorization of the total Hamiltonian into the non-commuting\nH0 (two-body) and H1 (many-body) terms, see text after Eq.\n(3). While for U \u2192 0 and for small time-steps \u03b4t \u2192 0\nthe decomposition is exactly satisfied, for large U one should\ngo to a sufficiently small time-step in order to avoid significant error buildup. Extrapolation to the limit \u03b4t \u2192 0 is\nstraightforward in principle [15]. (iii) Memory error. Our\napproach assumes that bath correlations exponentially decay\nresulting from the nonequilibrium condition \u2206\u03bc 6= 0. Based\non this crucial element, the influence functional may be truncated to include only a finite number of fictitious spins Ns ,\nwhere \u03c4c = Ns \u03b4t \u223c 1/\u2206\u03bc for the population dynamics and\n\u03c4c =\u223c 2/\u2206\u03bc for the particle current (see Figs. 5 and 11). The\ntotal IF is retrieved by taking the limit Ns \u2192 N , (N = t/\u03b4t).\nHowever, one should be careful at this point: Increasing the\nmemory length \u03c4c by adding more and more Trotter-terms into\nthe truncated IF [Eq. (9)] results in a build-up of the time\ndiscretization error, unless the time-step is controlled concurrently. Thus, one should carefully monitor both the time-step\nand the memory size for achieving reliable results. This challenge is similar to that encountered in the standard QUAPI\nmethod [21, 22].\nIt should be noted that the convergence with respect to\nmemory error is currently the most challenging aspect of the\ncalculations with the INFPI approach. This limits us to relatively small values of the ratio of on-site correlation to hybridization strength. Future work will be devoted to algorithmic optimization of the approach so that significantly larger\nmemory times may be reached.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nANDERSON DOT\n\nModel and Observables\n\nThe single impurity Anderson Model (SIAM) [4] is one\nof the most important models in condensed matter physics.\nWhile it was originally introduced to describe the behavior of\nmagnetic impurities in non-magnetic hosts [23], it has more\nrecently served as a generic model for understanding quantum\ntransport in correlated nanoscale systems [24\u201326]. In such\ncases, the impurity is hybridized with two reservoirs maintained at different chemical potentials, leading to nonequilibrium particle transport. The model includes a resonant level\nof energy \u01ebd , described by the creation operator d\u2020\u03c3 (\u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193\ndenotes the spin orientation) coupled to two fermionic leads\n(\u03b1 = L, R) of different chemical potentials \u03bc\u03b1 , but equal\ntemperatures \u03b2 \u22121 . The Hamiltonian H = H0 + H1 [see Eqs.\n(1)-(2)] includes the following terms\nX\nX\nH0 =\n(U/2 + \u01ebd )nd,\u03c3 +\n\u01ebk c\u2020\u03b1,k,\u03c3 c\u03b1,k,\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u03b1,k,\u03c3\n\nV\u03b1,k c\u2020\u03b1,k,\u03c3 d\u03c3\n\n+ h.c.\n\n\u03b1,k,\u03c3\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nH1 = U nd,\u2191 nd,\u2193 \u2212 (nd,\u2191 + nd,\u2193 ) .\n2\n\n(17)\n\nHere c\u2020\u03b1,k,\u03c3 (c\u03b1,k,\u03c3 ) denotes the creation (annihilation) of an\nelectron with momentum k and spin \u03c3 in the \u03b1 lead, U stands\nfor the onsite repulsion energy, and V\u03b1,k are the impurity-\u03b1\nlead coupling elements. nd,\u03c3 = d\u2020\u03c3 d\u03c3 is the impurity occupation number operator. The shifted single-particle energies\nP\nare denoted by E\nd = \u01ebd + U/2. We also define \u0393 =\n\u03b1 \u0393\u03b1 ,\nP\n2\nwhere \u0393\u03b1 = \u03c0 k |V\u03b1,k | \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebk ) is the hybridization energy of the resonant level with the \u03b1 metal. In what follows\nwe focus on two observables: the time dependent occupation\nof the resonant level and the tunneling current through the dot.\nThe population dynamics hnd,\u03c3 (t)i can be obtained by substituting\n\u00c2 = nd,\u03c3\n\n(18)\n\nin Eq. (6). The current at the \u03b1 contact hI\u03b1,\u03c3 i may be resolved\nin two ways. We may either calculate the population depletion\n(or gain) in the \u03b1 lead by defining \u00c2 as the sum over the \u03b1bath number operators,\nX \u2020\n\u00c2 =\nc\u03b1,k,\u03c3 c\u03b1,k,\u03c3 .\n(19)\nk\n\nThe current itself is given by the time derivative of the \u00c2 exd\npectation value, hI\u03b1,\u03c3 i = dt\nh\u00c2(t)i. Alternatively, the current\nat each end can be directly gathered by adopting the expresP\nsion \u00c2 = \u22122I k V\u03b1,k c\u2020\u03b1,k,\u03c3 d\u03c3 , with I as the imaginary\npart. In practice, we have employed the symmetric definition\nX\nX\n\u00c2 = \u2212I\nVL,k c\u2020L,k,\u03c3 d\u03c3 + I\nVR,k c\u2020R,k,\u03c3 d\u03c3 , (20)\nk\n\nk\n\n\f5\nsince its expectation value directly produces the symmetrized\ncurrent\nhIL,\u03c3 i \u2212 hIR,\u03c3 i\n.\nhI\u03c3 i =\n2\n\n(21)\n\n0.35\n0.3\n\n\u3008n\n\nd,\u03c3\n\n\u3009\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nt\u0393\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFIG. 2: Population of the resonant level in the Anderson model U =\n0 (thick full), U = 0.1 (dashed), U = 0.3 (dashed-dotted), U = 0.5\n(dotted). The physical parameters of the model are D = 1, \u2206\u03bc =\n0.4, Ed = 0.3, \u0393\u03b1 =0.025, and \u03b2\u0393 = 10.

Results\n\nWe focus on the following set of parameters: a symmetrically distributed voltage bias between two leads with \u2206\u03bc =\n0.4, flat bands centered at zero (the Fermi energy) with a cutoff at D = \u00b11, a resonant level energy Ed = 0.3, a hybridization strength \u0393\u03b1 = 0.025 = \u03c0|V\u03b1,k |2 \u03c1\u03b1 , with a constant density of states \u03c1\u03b1 , onsite repulsion U/\u0393 \u223c 2 \u2212 10, and a zero\nmagnetic field. For these parameters a convergence analysis\ncarried out in Ref. [15] has revealed that supplying Ls \u2265 100\nstates per spin per bath suffices for mimicking a continuous\nband structure. We have also found that for \u2206\u03bc = 0.4 a memory size \u03c4c \u223c 1/\u2206\u03bc \u223c 3.2 has lead to the convergence of the\ndot occupation when \u03b4t = 0.8 and Ns = 4, provided U\u0393 . 3\n[15, 27]. As we show below, the simulation of the current\nturns out to be more challenging as a larger memory size is\nrequired for reaching converging behavior, \u03c4c \u223c 2/\u2206\u03bc.\nBefore presenting our results we clarify the initial conditions adopted here. As explained above, at t = 0 we set the\nreservoirs and the system in a factorized state: The dot is assumed to be empty, and the two reservoirs are decoupled, each\nmaintained in a canonical state characterized by the FermiDirac statistics. This scenario is distinct from the interaction\nand voltage quenches considered in Ref. [13].\nFig. 2 displays the time evolution of the dot occupancy\nhnd,\u03c3 i with increasing on-site interaction for \u03b2\u0393 = 10, essentially reproducing the T = 0 data of Ref. [15]. Details\nabout convergence issues, and a comparison to Monte-Carlo\ndata were included in Ref. [15, 27]. In order to examine the\neffect of the bandwidth on the details of the dynamics the evolution of the noninteracting case (U = 0) is further compared\nto the wide flat band (WFB) behavior [16, 28],\nZ \u221e\n\u0393\nhnd,\u03c3 (t)i =\nd\u01eb[fL (\u01eb) + fR (\u01eb)]\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\u00d7\n\n\u3008 nd,\u03c3\u3009\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n\u3008 nd,\u03c3\u3009\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nt\u0393\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\u22121\n10\n\n1/\u03b2\u0393 10\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n0\n\n3\n\nFIG. 3: Population of the resonant level in the Anderson model U =\n0 (thick full), U = 0.1 (dashed), U = 0.3 (dashed-dotted) at various\ntemperatures, \u03b2\u0393 = 1, 2.5 and 10; top to bottom.

In particular, Fig. 5 demonstrates the behavior of the current with increasing memory size \u03c4c = Ns \u03b4t,\nshowing that convergence is reached when \u03c4c \u223c 7 \u2212 8. We\nnote that a significantly shorter memory size (\u03c4c \u223c 3 \u2212 4) has\nbeen required for converging the dot occupancy [15]. This\ndifference could be reasoned as follows. Since the tunneling current is calculated at a specific contact, the memory size\nthat should be accounted for inside the influence functional (9)\nshould roughly scales with the bias difference at that contact.\nThus, \u03c4c\u22121 \u223c \u2206\u03bc/2. In contrast, the population dynamics\nis sensitive to the full bias drop \u2206\u03bc, therefore bath correlations can be safely truncated beyond \u03c4c \u223c 1/\u2206\u03bc. In Fig.\n6 we present the behavior of the current upon increasing the\nnumber of bath states. It is interesting to note that the choice\nLs = 40 states per spin per bath already reproduces results\nin a good agreement with the Ls \u2192 \u221e limit. Thus, the finite\ntemperature algorithm adopted here [Eq. (16)], is superior\nto the strictly zero temperature algorithm of Ref. [15], even\nwhen applied to relatively low temperatures.\n\n\u3008 I\u03c3(t)\u3009/\u0393\n\n0.2\n\n3\nt\u0393\n\nt\u0393\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 6: Convergence of the current hI\u03c3 (t)i through the Anderson\ndot with increasing number of bath states Ls .

More recently, the mechanism of population inversion [5] has been explored using the asymmetric interacting 2LAM, where the two\nlevels differently couple to the leads. Furthermore, by including a left-right asymmetry in the dot-leads coupling, the mechanism of the transmission phase lapses in quantum dots [35]\nhas been resolved within mean-field theories [36, 37], MonteCarlo techniques [7], and functional and numerical renormalization group approaches [38, 39]. The 2LAM model incorporates an impurity with two electronic levels \u01eb1 < \u01eb2 , described by the creation operator d\u2020m , (m = 1, 2), coupled to\ntwo metal leads (\u03b1 = L, R) of different chemical potentials.\nThe Hamiltonian H = H0 + H1 includes the following terms\n\n\u3008 n (t\u2192 \u221e)\u3009\n\nA.

Parameters are the same as in Fig. 10.\n\nwhere m\u0304 = 2, 1 if m = 1, 2. In Fig. 9 we plot the asymptotic\npopulation dynamics, using the data from Fig. 8, and compare those values to mean-field results. As expected, the discrepancy between these two calculations increases for larger\nU . Deviations at U = 0 probably stem from the fact that the\nINFPI method assumes finite bands of D = \u00b11, while meanfield results are calculated for WFB leads.\nWe examine the temporal behavior of the current in Fig.\n10, varying the temperature and the many-body interaction\nstrength. For the present set of parameters we conclude that\nthe current decreases for large U , and that the temporal oscillations are washed out with increasing temperature. Finally, we use this data as highlighted in Fig. 11 to expose\na subtle convergence issue: the counteracting effect of different sources of errors, the time-step and the memory-size, and\nthe challenge to overcome them both together. Employing the\nsame set of parameters as in Fig. 10, we extract the steadystate value for the current, and display it as a function of \u03c4c ,\nat two different temperatures, using two different time-steps.\nWe find that for 4.5 < \u03c4c < 8 the steady state results are\nalmost fixed, fluctuating by only 1%. However, for \u03c4c > 8\na departure from the apparent steady state occurs, becoming\nlarger for larger \u03c4c . This behavior is caused by buildup of the\nTrotter factorization error within the truncated IF, Eq. (9). As\nexpected, the error increases at larger U . To control this error,\nat large \u03c4c a shorted time-step should be selected.\nFuture work will be dedicated to the strong coupling limit,\n\u0393m > \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 , for analyzing the charge oscillation effect [5].\nThe asymmetric L \u2212 R setup is also of great importance, for\nstudying the phase lapses mechanism beyond the mean-field\napproximation, at strong driving [36].\n\nV. SUMMARY\n\n\u0393L,2 =\u0393R,2 =0.05. The bias (\u2206\u03bc = 0.4) will be symmetrically distributed between the leads, assuming flat bands centered around zero with a cutoff at D = \u00b11. The interaction\nstrength will be limited to U/\u03931 . 4 and the temperature\nwill be varied between \u03b2\u03931 \u223c 1 \u2212 10. Fig. 8 displays the\nlevels' occupation as a function of time, for several interaction values, U =0, 0.1 and 0.2. We find that the HOMO population hn1 (t)i is increasing with U . In conjunction, due to\nthe increased importance of repulsion effects on the dot, the\nLUMO population hn2 (t)i depletes with U . The convergence\nof the data with respect to the number of bath states Ls , time\nstep \u03b4t, and memory size \u03c4c = Ns \u03b4t has been verified. A\ncomparison to the WFB limit for the noninteracting case reveals dynamical properties similar to those identified in Fig.\n2. Steady-state mean-field results are obtained by using expressions analogous to Eqs. (23) and (26) [5]. For example,\n\nWe have employed here the INFPI method [15] for studying the population dynamics and the current behavior of two\neminent molecular junction models: the single impurity Anderson model, and the 2-level Anderson dot. Considering\nvoltage-biased junctions, the effect of the intra-dot electronelectron repulsion energy and the temperature were jointly\nanalyzed. We have compared our results to mean-field calculations, showing an increased discrepancy when many-body\ninteractions are enhanced. A careful convergence analysis has\nbeen performed, demonstrating how to adequately converge\nthe INFPI simulations.\nThe INFPI method has been described here in connection\nwith molecular transport junctions. We expect this flexible tool to become useful for studying other-related impurity\nmodels, and for exploring nonlinear thermoelectric effects in\nmolecular junctions [33]. In particular, future work will be focused on simulating the dynamics of extended junctions, e.g.,\n\n\f9\na multi-site chain, and on extending the method to include vibrational effects [31] in a non perturbative manner.\n\nlike to acknowledge the NSF for financial support.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDS acknowledges support from NSERC.
