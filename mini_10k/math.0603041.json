We consider the problem of decomposing monetary risk in the presence\nof a fully traded market in some risks. We show that a mark-to-market approach to\npricing leads to such a decomposition if the risk measure is time-consistent in the sense\nof Delbaen.\n\n1. Introduction.\nIn many contexts, financial products are priced and sold in the absence of a market (i.e\na fully traded market) in these products. Typically these products have a dependence\n(either explicit or implicit) on one or more securities or contracts in a traded (financial)\nmarket. An obvious example is insurance (and, in particular, life insurance), but other\nexamples include (the benefits provided by) pension funds and stock and options in nonquoted companies. This paper is concerned with the questions of valuing the liabilities\nof an (intermediate) market maker in such products and of how to make and invest\nfinancial reserves for them.\nWe take the view that such a market maker is a price-taker in the traded financial\nmarket (hereafter referred to simply as the market) and is a price-maker in its own\nproducts (hereafter referred to as contracts)-the ultimate value of which are contingent\non risks not present in the market. From this point of view we may add in other nonmarket risk such as, for example, interruption of business, fraud, litigation, insurable\nrisks and economic factors (such as the behavior of price indices and salaries) which\nimpinge upon the eventual settlement value (or payoff) of these contracts.\nWe adopt the view that in such a setup, the intermediate market maker (hereafter\nreferred to as the intermediate) will adopt a coherent risk measure (on discounted final\nvalues) as their valuation method and show how this implies certain constraints on the\nform of this risk measure and finally, how if these constraints are met, the risk measure\nimplies a reserving method and an investment strategy in the market.\n2. Contracts contingent on lives\nAs we have already seen in the introduction, the issues we address are by no means\nlimited to life assurance and related products, indeed they have relevance to monetary\nrisk management in any conceivable context; nevertheless, historically, life assurance and\nKey words: fundamental theorem of asset pricing; convex cone; coherent risk measure; intermediate\nmarket; monetary risk.\nAMS 2000 subject classifications: Primary 91B30; secondary 91B28, 91B26, 90C46, 60H05.\nThis research was supported by the grant 'Distributed Risk Management' in the Quantitative Finance\ninitiative funded by EPSRC and the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSAUL JACKA AND ABDELKAREM BERKAOUI\n\nannuities (the two main products of life insurance companies) are a major source of such\nissues. Consequently we shall briefly discuss the traditional approach to such problems.\nInsurance as an institution gives its customers the ability to share the risk they may\nface in the future by buying a suitable contract. The law of averages or Strong Law of\nLarge Numbers is used to reduce risk by sharing a part of it between a large group of\ncustomers. Given that N individuals are willing to buy N contracts of the same type\nthat pay a fixed amount X0 = 1 if the defined risk, death occurs during a time interval\n[0, T ] and by ignoring fees and taxes, the premium p should be a function of N, T, X0\nand q- the probability that the risk will happen during that interval. The SLLN says\nthen that if we have independence between different individuals, then\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212\u03b4 T YN\np=E e\n,\nN\nwhere \u03b4 is the discount factor and YN is the number of customers who die, then p = e\u2212\u03b4 T q\nwith\nYN\ne\u2212\u03b4 T\n\u2192 p a.s.,\nN\nwhen N goes to infinity, so that p is a fair net premium to charge for the insurance.\nIn case the size of the loss is uncertain then the premium is given by (1 + \u03b8) p, where p\nis the premium for the average losses and \u03b8 is a (safety) loading factor to cover possible\nfluctuations.\nIn practice also, customers are of different ages so that p varies and it is assumed that\nthe type of contract influences mortality risk so that different values of p are used for\ndifferent types of contracts.\nIn the presence of a financial risk (e.g equity-linked insurance contracts), the direct\napplication of the SLLN principle may not give a suitable result as it does not take into\naccount the possibility of investing in the financial market and the restriction of such\npricing to purely financial claims does not necessarily respect the no-arbitrage property.\nAs we can see, this procedure implies the use of a coherent risk measure for valuing\ndiscounted monetary risks.\nMany papers have been devoted to this kind of problem and many techniques have\nbeen proposed to price such contracts. We recall the risk-minimizing technique which\nconsiders the biometric risk as a non-tradable risk in an incomplete financial market, see\nT. M\u00f8ller [5] for more details.\nIn this paper, we propose to build a pricing that respects both SLLN and no-arbitrage\nprinciples. In order to do this, we recall in section 3 some results on one-period coherent risk measure and the well-known theorem giving its representation in terms of test\nprobabilities. In section 4, we work in a multi-period case, we define a chain of coherent risk measures that define prices along the time axis and introduce some properties,\nnamely lower, weak and strong time-consistency. While lower time-consistency is a natural property in this context, the weak one suggests that the pricing is derived from a\nsingle set of test probabilities and the strong one allows us to hedge a claim by a trade\nat each period. In section 5, we consider the financial market as an embedded entity in\nthe global market and decompose a given pricing into its financial and intermediary, or\nprerisk, parts. We show that the pricing can be constructed from its two parts under the\n\n\fON DECOMPOSING RISK AND RESERVING\n\n3\n\ntime-consistency property. Finally, in section 7, we fix a no-arbitrage pricing mechanism\n\u03a0 on the financial market and derive the family of time-consistent pricing mechanisms\nthat coincide with \u03a0 on the purely financial claims.\n3. One-period coherent risk measures.\nLet (\u03a9, F , P) be a probability space with F0 \u2282 F a sub-\u03c3-algebra. In this section\nwe recall the main result on the characterization of a one-period coherent risk measure\ndefined on the vector space L\u221e (F ) with values in L\u221e (F0 ). The \u03c3-algebra F0 is not\nnecessarily trivial.\nDefinition 3.1. (See Delbaen [1]) We say that the mapping \u03c1 : L\u221e (F ) \u2192 L\u221e (F0 ) is a\ncoherent risk measure if it satisfies the following axioms :\n(1) Monotonicity: For every X, Y \u2208 L\u221e (F ),\nX \u2264 Y a.s \u21d2 \u03c1(X) \u2264 \u03c1(Y ) a.s.\n(2) Subadditivity: For every X, Y \u2208 L\u221e (F ),\n\u03c1(X + Y ) \u2264 \u03c1(X) + \u03c1(Y ) a.s.\n(3) Translation invariance: For every X \u2208 L\u221e (F ) and y \u2208 L\u221e (F0 ),\n\u03c1(X + y) = \u03c1(X) + y a.s.\n(4) F0 -Positive homogeneity: For every X \u2208 L\u221e (F ) and a \u2208 L\u221e\n+ (F0 ), we have\n\u03c1(a X) = a \u03c1(X) a.s.\nDefinition 3.2. The coherent risk measure \u03c1 : L\u221e (F ) \u2192 L\u221e (F0 ) is said to satisfy the\nFatou property if a.s \u03c1(X) \u2264 lim inf \u03c1(Xn ), for any sequence (Xn )n\u22651 uniformly bounded\nby 1 and converging to X in probability.\nDefinition 3.3. The coherent risk measure \u03c1 : L\u221e (F ) \u2192 L\u221e (F0 ) is called relevant if\nfor each set A \u2208 F with P[A| F0] > 0 a.s, we have that \u03c1(1A ) > 0 a.s.\nProposition 3.4. (See Delbaen [1]) Let the mapping \u03c1 : L\u221e (F ) \u2192 L\u221e (F0 ) be a relevant\ncoherent risk measure satisfying the Fatou property. Then\n(1) The acceptance set A\u03c1 := {X \u2208 L\u221e (F ) ; \u03c1(X) \u2264 0 a.s} is a weak\u2217 -closed\nconvex cone, arbitrage-free, stable under multiplication by bounded positive F0 measurable random variables and contains L\u221e\n\u2212 (F ).\n(2) There exists a convex set of probability measures Q, all of them being absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to P, with their densities forming an L1 (P)-closed set,\nand such that for X \u2208 L\u221e (F ):\n(3.1)\n\n\u03c1(X) = ess-sup {EQ (X| F0) ; Q \u2208 Q} .\n\nProof. We sketch the proof. Since \u03c1 is a coherent risk measure, A\u03c1 is a convex cone,\nclosed under multiplication by bounded positive F0 -measurable random variables and\n\u2217\ncontains L\u221e\n\u2212 . Its weak -closeness follows from the Fatou property and it is arbitragefree since \u03c1 is relevant. Now for the second assertion, we remark that, by applying the\nHahn-Banach separation theorem with exhaustion argument (as in Schachermayer [6]),\n\n\f4\n\nSAUL JACKA AND ABDELKAREM BERKAOUI\n\nwe may deduce that there exists some g \u2208 A\u2217\u03c1, where A\u2217\u03c1 is the dual cone of A\u03c1 in L1 ,\nsuch that g > 0 a.s, then we define\n\u001b\n\u001a\ndQ\n\u2217 dQ\ne\n\u2208 A\u03c1 ,\n> 0 a.s ,\nQ = Q\u226aP;\ndP\ndP\n\nand Q = Qe . Now let X \u2208 L\u221e (F ) and f + \u2208 L\u221e\n+ (F0 ), then by the translation invariance\n+\nproperty, we get that f (X \u2212 \u03c1(X)) \u2208 A\u03c1 and for every \u03b5 > 0, f + (X \u2212 \u03c1(X)) + \u03b5 \u2208\n/ A\u03c1 .\nConsequently, we deduce (3.3).\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.5. Given a coherent risk measure \u03c1, we define Q\u03c1 as follows:\n\u001b\n\u001a\ndQ\n\u2217\n\u03c1\n(3.2)\n\u2208 A\u03c1 .\nQ = Q\u226aP;\ndP\n\nConversely, given Q a collection (not necessarily closed, or convex) of probability measures absolutely continuous with respect to P, we define\n(3.3)\n\n\u03c1Q (X) = ess-sup {EQ (X| F0) ; Q \u2208 Q} .\n\nThe set Q\u03c1 is the largest subset Q for which \u03c1 = \u03c1Q .\n4. Risk measure versus Market.\nReturning to our problem: we suppose that the intermediary is equipped with the\nprobability space (\u03a9, G, P), with a filtration G = (Gt )Tt=0 , with G = GT , modelling the\nflow of information on the discrete time axis T+ = T \u222a {T } with T = {0, ..., T \u2212 1}.\nWe further suppose that the intermediary's pricing mechanism is \u03c1 = (\u03c10 , ..., \u03c1T \u22121 )\nwhere each \u03c1t denotes the price at time t of future (discounted) payoffs. Note that\nby choosing to price the discounted payoffs rather than the payoffs themselves, it's not\nnecessary to introduce the discount rate in the property of translation invariance. Define\nthe acceptance set of positions\nAt = {X \u2208 L\u221e (G) ; \u03c1t (X) \u2264 0 P a.s. },\nthe set of liabilities which the intermediary is willing to accept for no nett charge or no\nnett reserve at time t.\nDefinition 4.1. We say that the vector \u03c1 = (\u03c10 , ..., \u03c1T \u22121 ) is a chain of coherent risk\nmeasures if for each t \u2208 T, the mapping \u03c1t : L\u221e (GT ) \u2192 L\u221e (Gt ) fulfills all the properties\nof a relevant coherent risk measure with the Fatou property (taking F = GT , F0 = Gt in\nDefinition 3.1).\nIt follows from Proposition 3.4 that for all t \u2208 T, there exists an L1 -closed convex set\nof probabilities Qt = Q\u03c1t , absolutely continuous w.r.t P such that for every X \u2208 L\u221e (G),\n\u03c1t (X) = ess-supQ\u2208Qt EQ (X| Gt ).\nTo determine the natural relationship between the subsets of probability measures\n(Q0 , ..., QT \u22121 ) = (Q\u03c10 , ..., Q\u03c1T \u22121 ),\nt,T\nlet us consider a contract CX\nissued at time t and paying the t-discounted amount\nX \u2208 L\u221e (G) (i.e discounted to time t) to the holder at time T . Its price at time t is\ngiven by \u03c1t (X). The buyer may choose, instead to buy another contract C\u03c1t,t+s\npaying\nt+s (X)\n\n\fON DECOMPOSING RISK AND RESERVING\n\n5\n\n\u03c1t+s (X) at time t + s. Its price is given by \u03c1t \u25e6 \u03c1t+s (X). This contract can be seen also as\na contract which gives the buyer, the right to choose at time t + s between cash \u03c1t+s (X)\nt+s,T\nor a new contract CX\n. We conclude then that for every t, t + s \u2208 T+ and X we should\nhave\n(4.1)\n\n\u03c1t (X) \u2264 \u03c1t \u25e6 \u03c1t+s (X).\n\nWe say that \u03c1 is lower time-consistent if \u03c1 satisfies (4.1) which is equivalent to saying\nthat the acceptance sets satisfy At+s \u2282 At or by a duality argument that Qt \u2282 Qt+s .

It is in this situation (where \u03c1 is time-consistent) that we can replicate\nclaims in A by a sequence of one-period trades. This explains the 'mark-to-market'\nrequirement of section 1.\n5. The decomposition of the global market.\nExample 5.1. We consider a contract that provides one share of XY Z stock to the\ninsured if he or she is still alive in one year's time, and nothing otherwise.\n(1) What's the fair premium for this contract?\n(2) What's the 'self financing ' strategy if it exists?\nTo formulate this problem, let S denote the discounted price of the XY Z share in one\nyear's time and let\n\u001a\n1 if the insured is alive then\nY =\n0 otherwise\nWe suppose that S and Y are defined respectively on two probability spaces (\u03a91 , G 1 , P1 )\nand (\u03a92 , G 2 , P2 ), with G 1 = \u03c3(S) and that the pricing of purely financial (resp. insurance)\nclaims is given by pF (resp. pI ). The payoff of the contract is H = S Y . To price such a\ndef\nclaim in one-period case, we remark first that H = H(S) where H(x) = x Y for a scalar\nx. Remark also that for a fixed x, the claim x Y is a purely insurance claim and it's priced\ndef\nby pI (x Y ) and that the claim H F = pI (x Y )|x=S is a purely financial claim, priced by\npF (H F ). We propose then the premium of H, p(H) = pF (H F ). The 'self financing '\nstrategy will be the one to hedge the claim H F . We obtain then the decomposition of the\ndef\nclaim H as follows: H = p(H) + U F + U I , where the claims U F = H F \u2212 pF (H F ) and\ndef\nU I = H \u2212 H F are admissible.\nUnder the assumption that both PF and PI are coherent risk measures with AF and\nAI their respective acceptance sets, the risk measure p defined above is a coherent risk\nmeasure with acceptance set A, satisfying A = AF + AIs , where\n\b\nAIs = X : f (S)X \u2208 AI , for all f \u2208 L\u221e\n+ (R) .\nIn this section, we suppose that we're given a probability space (\u03a9, G, P) and a coherent\nrisk measure \u03c1 and F \u2282 G the financial sub-\u03c3-algebra. Our aim is\n(1) to construct, first in the one-period case, two coherent risk measures\n\u03c1F : L\u221e (F ) \u2192 R and \u03c1I : L\u221e (G) \u2192 L\u221e (F ),\nsuch that \u03c1 = \u03c1F on L\u221e (F ) and conditioning on F , \u03c1 = \u03c1I .\n(2) to establish necessary and sufficient conditions on \u03c1 such that \u03c1 = \u03c1F \u25e6 \u03c1I .\nRemark that if we denote G0 = {\u2205, \u03a9}, G0+ = F , G1 = G and suppose that \u03c1 is timeconsistent w.r.t the filtration (G0 , G0+ , G1 ), then the acceptance set A will be decomposed\nas follows: A = AF + AI where AF = A \u2229 L\u221e (F ) is the financial part of the whole\nmarket, whilst the second component AI = A0+ , is the intermediary market, equivalent\nto the whole market in the absence of the financial market (F = G0 ). Any claim then\ncan be decomposed into its financial and intermediary parts. The corresponding pricing\nmechanisms are given respectively by QF = [Q\u03c1 ]0,0+ and QI = [Q\u03c1 ]0+ ,1 . Here we adopted\nthe notation of the last section.\n\n\f12\n\nSAUL JACKA AND ABDELKAREM BERKAOUI\n\nTo generalize this setting to a multi-period case, we introduce the following notation.\nLet (\u03a9, G, P) be a probability space equipped with the filtration (Gt )t\u2208T+ . Let (Ft )t\u2208T+\nbe the filtration modeling the information in the financial market such that for every\nt \u2208 T+ we have Ft \u2282 Gt with F0 and G0 trivial. We assume that the intermediary makes\nprices according to a pricing mechanism \u03c1, defined by a set of P-absolutely continuous\nprobabilities Q on \u03a9. We suppose w.l.o.g that P \u2208 Q and that the set Q is an L1 (P)closed convex set. Define Qe to be theWsubset of P-equivalent probability measures in Q,\nthe intermediate \u03c3-algebras Gt+ = Gt Ft+1 and the filtration\nG\u2217 = (G0 , G0+ , G1 , ..., GT ).\n\nDefine the subsets QF and QI as follows. For t \u2208 T, we define Qt,F = [Q]t,t+ and\nT \u22121 t,F\nT \u22121 t,I\nQF = Tt=0\nQ . In the same way we define Qt,I = [Q]t+ ,t+1 and QI = Tt=0\nQ . We\nF\nI\ndenote respectively by \u03c1 and \u03c1 the coherent risk measures associated to the subsets\nQF and QI . In the following lemmas we state some interesting properties of these two\nsubsets of probabilities.\nDefinition 5.1. Let t \u2208 T. We define the binary relation \u223ct,F , defined on the set of all\nP-absolutely continuous probabilities, as follows:\nQ \u223ct,F Q\u2032 iff {Q}t,F = {Q\u2032 }t,F .\nWe define \u223ct,I in the same fashion.\nLemma 5.2. \u223ct,F is an equivalence relation. Moreover Qt,F =\nogous results hold for \u223ct,I .\n\nS\n\nQ\u2208Q {Q}\n\nt,F\n\n. The anal-\n\nProof. The binary relation \u223ct,F is obviously an equivalence relation. Take a probability\nmeasures Q \u2208 Qt,F , then there exists a probabilityT\nmeasure Q\u2032 \u2208 Q such that Q \u223ct,F Q\u2032 ,\n\u2032 t,F\nt,F\nwhich means that Q \u2208 {Q } and hence Q \u2282 Q\u2208Q {Q}t,F . The reverse inclusion is\nobvious.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.3. For every Q \u2208 QF and t \u2208 T, there exists some Qt \u2208 Q such that\nEQ (X|Gt ) = EQt (X|Gt ) for every X \u2208 L\u221e (Gt+ ). Analogously, for every Q \u2208 QI and\n+\nt \u2208 T, there exists some Qt \u2208 Q such that EQ (X|Gt+ ) = EQt+ (X|Gt+ ) for every X \u2208\nL\u221e (Gt+1 ).\nProof. Immediate consequence of Definition 4.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 5.4. Let Q be a set of P-absolutely continuous probability measures on \u03a9.\nThen\n(1) Q is G\u2217 -m-stable if and only if Q = QF \u2229 QI .\n(2) The subsets QF and QI are G\u2217 -m-stable. Moreover\n(QF )I = (QI )F = P,\nwhere P is the set of all P-absolutely continuous probability measures and the\nclosure is taken in L1 (\u03a9).\nProof. The first assertion is an immediate consequence of Lemma 4.15. The second\nassertion is an immediate consequence of assertion (1) since (QF )F = QF and QF \u2282\n(QF )I , so QF = (QF )F \u2229 (QF )I . We make the same argument for the I-part. We remark\n\n\fON DECOMPOSING RISK AND RESERVING\n\n13\n\nalso that P e \u2282 (QF )I , (QI )F where P e is the set of all P-equivalent probability measures.\nIndeed let Q \u2208 P e with f = \u039bQ and t \u2208 T fixed.

We do the same for the inclusion P e \u2282 (QI )F .\n\u0003\nLet \u03c1 = \u03c1Q be the chain associated to the set of probabilities Q and \u03c1 = \u03c10 . Let us\ndefine the acceptance cone A = A\u03c1 associated to the coherent risk measure \u03c1 by\nA = {X \u2208 L\u221e (G) ; \u03c1(X) \u2264 0}.\nA is then a weak\u2217 -closed convex cone in L\u221e . Our objective is to decompose this trading\ncone in the global market into the sum of two trading cones, one in the financial market\nand the other in the intermediary's market.\nWe define the following convex cones\nKtF = {X \u2208 L\u221e (Gt+ ) ; \u03c1t (X) \u2264 0} = At \u2229 L\u221e (Gt+ ),\nKtI = {X \u2208 L\u221e (Gt+1 ) ; \u03c1t+ (X) \u2264 0} = At+ \u2229 L\u221e (Gt+1 ),\nfor t \u2208 T, KTF = L\u221e\n\u2212 (G),\nAF = K0F + ... + KTF ,\nand\nAI = K0I + ... + KTI \u22121 .\nThen\nLemma 5.5. A = AF + AI iff Q is G\u2217 -time-consistent.\nProof. Immediate consequence of Lemma 4.21.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.6. Remark that this corresponds to mark-to-market approach valuation.\nThe question now is to characterize the pricing mechanism in both trading cones. In\nthe next lemma we prove that the cones AF and AI are respectively the acceptance sets\nof the risk measures \u03c1F and \u03c1I .\nLemma 5.7. AF = A\u03c1F and AI = A\u03c1I .\nProof. Since QF is G\u2217 -time-consistent, then A\u03c1F = W + M where W = W0 + ... + WT\nand M = M0 + ... + MT \u22121 with\nWt = {X \u2208 L\u221e (Gt+ ) ; \u03c1Ft (X) \u2264 0},\nand\nMt = {X \u2208 L\u221e (Gt+1 ) ; \u03c1Ft+ (X) \u2264 0},\nF\nF\nfor t \u2208 T and WT = L\u221e\n\u2212 (G). By definition Q \u2282 Q , and we deduce that each Wt \u2282 Kt .\nNow let X \u2208 KtF and Q \u2208 QF . By applying Lemma 5.3, there exists some Qt \u2208 Q such\nthat\nEQ (X|Gt ) = EQt (X|Gt ) \u2264 \u03c1t (X) \u2264 0.\n\n\f14\n\nSAUL JACKA AND ABDELKAREM BERKAOUI\n\nIn consequence \u03c1Ft (X) \u2264 0 and X \u2208 Wt . We have that KtF = Wt and in consequence\nAF = W . It suffices therefore to prove that M \u2282 L\u221e\n\u2212 which follows if we can prove that\nfor\nt\n\u2208\nT.\neach Mt \u2282 L\u221e\n\u2212\nLet X \u2208 Mt , which means that X \u2208 L\u221e (Gt+1 ) and \u03c1Ft+ (X) \u2264 0. Then for every\nQ \u2208 QF we have EQ (X|Gt+ ) \u2264 0.

Let Q1 and Q2 be two convex subsets in P with \u03c11 and \u03c12 their respective\ncoherent risk measures.

The assertions (2) and (3) are equivalent by duality argument.

To prove the last assertion remark that for all t \u2208 T\nand Y \u2208 L\u221e (Ft+1 ), we have:\ndef\n\n\u03c1\u03a6\nt+ (Y ) = ess-supQ\u2208\u03a6 EQ (Y |Ft+1 \u2297 It ) = Y,\nand\n\u03a0\n\u03c1\u03a0\u0302\nt (Y ) = \u03c1t (Y ).\n\u221e\nWe prove then by induction on t = T \u2212 1, . . . , 0 that \u03c1t (X) = \u03c1\u03a0\nt (X) for all X \u2208 L (F ).\nFor t = T \u2212 1 we obtain\n\u03a0\n\u03a6\n\u03c1T \u22121 (X) = \u03c1\u03a0\u0302\nT \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c1(T \u22121)+ (X) = \u03c1T \u22121 (X).\n\nSuppose that the induction hypothesis is true until t + 1, we shall prove it for t. We get\n\u03a0\n\u03a0\u0302\n\u03a6\n\u03a6\n\u03c1t (X) = \u03c1\u03a0\u0302\nt \u25e6 \u03c1t+ \u25e6 \u03c1t+1 (X) = \u03c1t \u25e6 \u03c1t+ \u25e6 \u03c1t+1 (X).\n\u221e\nRemark that \u03c1\u03a0\nt+1 (X) \u2208 L (Ft+1 ), then\n\u03a0\n\u03a0\n\u03c1t (X) = \u03c1\u03a0\nt \u25e6 \u03c1t+1 (X) = \u03c1t (X),\n\nfrom the time-consistency of \u03a0.\n\n\u0003\nReferences\n\n[1] F.
