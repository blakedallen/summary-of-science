Moreover, mechanisms\nto localize gravity on a brane [8, 9] have led to the realization that if extra dimensions\nexist, they need not be compact [10]. In the simplest formulation of these models no bulk\nmatter states are assumed to exist and thus only gravity propagates in the extra dimensions.\nNevertheless \"bulk\" (i.e. transverse to 3-brane space dimensions) physics turns out to be\nvery interesting giving alternative explanations to other puzzles of particle physics. For\nexample, by assuming the existence of a Standard Model (SM) neutral spin\n\n1\n2\n\nfermion in\n\nthe bulk one can explain the smallness of the neutrino masses without invoking the seesaw\nmechanism [11\u201320]. However, it is not necessary to confine the SM fields to the brane.\nAssuming that the SM fields can propagate in the bulk interesting new possibilities arise.\nFor example one can attempt to explain the pattern of the SM fermion mass hierarchy by\nlocalizing the SM fermions at different places in the bulk [21\u201324]. These considerations give\nthe motivation for considering the phenomenology associated with spin 0,\n\n1\n2\n\nand 1 fields\n\npropagating in extra dimension(s). Since our discussions will be limited to models with\nlocalized gravity and in particular to Randall-Sundrum (RS) type constructions, we will be\ninterested in the phenomenology of fields that live in a slice of AdS5 spacetime. If one also\nwants to explore the supersymmetric version of the above models, it is also necessary to\nstudy the phenomenology of spin\n\n3\n2\n\nfield on the same background geometry.\n\nIt has been shown that in the context of RS type models the graviton is localized on\npositive tension branes and suppressed on the negative ones [9]. In Ref. [25] it was also\nshown that the AdS5 background geometry of these models can localize the zero mode\nof a massless scalar field on positive tension branes (see also [26]). Moreover, the same\nbackground localizes the spin\n\n1\n2\n\nfermions on negative tension branes [15,20,27\u201334]. The same\n\nlocalization behaviour holds for spin\n\n3\n2\n\nfermions [27,31,35]. However, the AdS5 background\n\ngeometry cannot localize massless Abelian gauge fields [36\u201338] if one tries to get them from\na higher dimensional vector field. One can, however, get localized massless Abelian fields\nfrom higher dimensional antisymmetric forms as it was done in [39].\nThe addition of mass terms modifies the localization properties. For example, it was\nshown in Ref. [2, 15, 20, 32, 40] that the addition of an appropriate mass term in the action\n\n1\n\n\fof a spin\n\n1\n2\n\nfield can result in the localization of the zero mode that resembles that of the\n\ngraviton (the magnitude of the mass term in this case controls the extent of localization).\nIn the present paper we show that the same can occur in the case of spin 0,\n\n3\n2\n\nfields with\n\nappropriate mass terms. Furthermore we show that by adding a mass term of a particular\nform in the action of a massless Abelian gauge field we can achieve the desired localization of\nthe massless zero mode which can be made to resemble that of the graviton. The mass term\nin this case must necessarily consist of a five dimensional bulk mass part and a boundary\npart.\nFrom the above it is clear that particles of all spins, with appropriate bulk mass terms,\ncan exhibit zero mode localization on positive tension branes, just as for the graviton.\nIn the context of multi-brane models with localized gravity the above implies a further\ninteresting possibility: the phenomenon of multi-localization in models that contain at\nleast two positive tension branes. Multi-localization, as we will see, is closely related to the\nappearance of light, localized strongly coupled Kaluza-Klein (KK) states (their coupling to\nmatter can be even larger than the coupling of the zero mode). Thus the mass spectrum of\nmulti-localized fields is distinct from the mass spectrum of singly localized fields, resulting\nin the possibility of new phenomenological signals. Anomalously light states may also arise\nin theories without multi-localization (i.e. even in configurations with one positive brane)\nin models with twisted boundary conditions.\nThe appearance of light KK states can be of particular phenomenological interest. For\nexample in the case of the graviton, multi-localization and thus the appearance of light KK\ngraviton excitations, gives rise to the exciting possibility of Bi-gravity [41\u201344] (Multi-gravity\n[44\u201347]) where part (or even all) of gravitational interactions can come from massive spin 2\nparticle(s) (KK state(s)) [41\u201351]. In this case the large mass gap between the anomalously\nlight KK state(s) and the rest of the tower is critical in order to avoid modifications of\nNewton's law at intermediate distances.\nAnomalously light spin\n\n1\n2\n\nKK states can also arise when a bulk fermion is multi-localized\n\n[20]. The non-trivial structure of the KK spectrum in this case, with the characteristic mass\ngap between the light state(s) and the rest of the tower, can be used for example to construct\nmodels with a small number of active or sterile neutrinos involved in the oscillation (the\nrest will decouple since they will be heavy).\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: In the next Section we review the general\nframework and discuss the general idea of multi-localization in the context of models with\nlocalized gravity. In Section 3 we study the multi-localization properties of a bulk scalar\n2\n\n\ffield. In Section 4 we review the situation of a bulk fermion field. In Section 5 we study in\ndetail the possibilities of localization and multi-localization of an Abelian gauge field. In\nSection 6 present the possibility of multi-localization in the case of a gravitino and finally\nin Section 7 we review the same phenomena for the case of graviton [41, 42]. In section 8\nwe discuss how multi-localization is realized in the context of supersymmetric versions of\nthe previous models. The overall implications and conclusions are presented in section 9.\n\n2\n\nGeneral Framework - The idea of Multi-Localization\n\nThe original formulation of multi-localization of gravity was obtained in five dimensions\nfor the case that there is more than one positive tension brane. If the warp factor has a\n\"bounce\", in the sense that it has a minimum (or minima) between the positive tension\nbranes, the massless graviton appears as a bound state of the attractive potentials associated\nwith the positive tension branes with its wave function peaked around them. Moreover\nin this case there are graviton excitations corresponding to additional bound states with\nwave functions also peaked around the positive tension branes. They are anomalously\nlight compared to the usual Kaluza Klein tower of graviton excitations. The reason for\nthis is that the magnitude of their wavefunction closely approximates that of the massless\nmode, differing significantly only near the position of the bounce where the wave function\nis exponentially small. The mass they obtain comes from this region and as a result is\nexponentially suppressed relative to the usual KK excitations.\nThe first models of this type involved negative tension branes sandwiched between the\npositive tension branes [41]. That this is necessary in the case of flat branes with vanishing\ncosmological constant in four dimensions is easy to see because, for a single flat brane, the\nminimum of the warp factor is at infinity and thus any construction with another positive\nbrane at a finite distance will have a discontinuity in the derivative of the warp factor at\nthe point of matching of the solutions and thus at that point a negative tension brane will\nemerge.\nSubsequently it was pointed out that a free negative tension brane(s) violate the weaker\nenergy condition and lead to a ghost radion field(s). A way out of this problem was suggested\nby some of us through the use of AdS4 branes [43] (see [52] for a different possibility\ninvolving an external four-form field). In this case the minimum of a single brane is at finite\ndistance and thus one can match the solution for two positive branes without introducing a\nnegative tension brane. However a drawback of this approach is that the four dimensional\ncosmological constant is negative in conflict with the current indications for a positive\n3\n\n\fcosmological constant.\nRecently we have shown how it is possible to obtain the \"bounce\" and the related\nmultilocalisation for zero cosmological constant in four dimensions without the need for\nnegative tension branes [44]. We have shown this is possible even in cylindrically symmetric\nmodels if one allows for non-homogeneous brane tensions and/or bulk cosmological constant.\nIn this case the structure of the effective four dimensional theory is very similar to the five\ndimensional case for the modes which do not depend on the new angular co-ordinate.\nIn particular one finds a massless graviton and anomalously light massive modes with\nwavefunctions peaked around the positive tension branes.\nIn this paper we are interested in whether spin 0, 21 , 1, and\n\n3\n2\n\nfields can similarly show the\n\nphenomena of multi-localisation we found for the graviton in suitable curved backgrounds.\nWe will show that the curved background can also induce localisation for the case of spin\n0, 12 and\n\n3\n2\n\nfields but not for a massless vector field. However, even in flat spacetime in\n\nhigher dimensions, it is also possible to induce localisation by introducing mass of a very\nspecific form for these fields. We will show that this effect can localise all fields with spin\n\u2264 32 , including the graviton.\nFor simplicity we will work mainly with the five dimensional compactification. In the\ncontext of the discussion of the multilocalisation of fields of spin \u2264 32 , what is important is\n\nthe nature of the curved background as determined by the warp factor. Thus the general\nfeatures are applicable to all models of multilocalisation with the same warp factor profile.\nHowever the interpretation of the mass terms needed to achieve multilocalisation differs.\nIn the case of models with negative tension branes the masses correspond to a combination\nof a constant bulk mass together with a brane term corresponding to the coupling to\nboundary sources. In the case of models without negative tension branes the mass must\nhave a non-trivial profile in the bulk. In certain cases this profile may be guaranteed by\nsupersymmetry.\nIn the five dimensional models considered here, the fifth dimension y is compactified on\n\nan orbifold, S 1 /Z2 of radius R, with \u2212L \u2264 y \u2264 L. The five dimensional spacetime is a slice\n\nof AdS5 which is described by5 :\n\nds2 = e\u22122\u03c3(y) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the warp factor \u03c3(y) depends on the details of the model considered.\n5\nWe will assume that the background metric is not modified by the presence of the bulk fields, that is,\nwe will neglect the back-reaction on the metric from their presence.\n\n4\n\n\fSince we are interested in the phenomenology of fields propagating in the above slice of\nAdS5 our goal is to determine the mass spectrum and their coupling to matter. Starting\nfrom a five dimensional Lagrangian, in order to give a four dimensional interpretation to\nthe five dimensional fields, one has to implement the dimensional reduction. This procedure\nincludes the representation of the five dimensional fields \u03a6(x, y) in terms of the KK tower\nof states:\n\u03a6(x, y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03a6(n) (x)f (n) (y)\n\n(2)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere f (n) (y) is a complete orthonormal basis spanning the compact dimension. The idea\nbehind this KK decomposition is to find an equivalent 4D description of the five dimensional\nphysics associated with the field of interest, through an infinite number of KK states with\nmass spectrum and couplings that encode all the information about the five dimensions.\nThe function f (n) (y) describes the localization of the wavefuntion of the n-th KK mode in\nthe extra dimension. It can be shown that f (n) (y) obeys a second order differential equation\nwhich, after a convenient change of variables and/or a redefinition6 of the wavefunction,\nreduces to an ordinary Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n1\nm2\n\u2212 \u2202z2 + V (z) f\u02c6(n) (z) = n f\u02c6(n) (z)\n2\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(3)\n\nThe mass spectrum and the wavefunctions (and thus the couplings) are determined by\nsolving the above differential equation. Obviously all the information about the five dimensional physics is contained in the form of the potential V (z). For example in the case of\nthe graviton the positive tension branes correspond to attractive \u03b4-function potential wells\nwhereas negative tension branes to \u03b4-function barriers. The form of the potential between\nthe branes is determined by the AdS5 background.\n\n2.1\n\nMulti-Localization and light KK states\n\nMulti-localization emerges when one considers configuration of branes such that the corresponding potential V (z) has at least two (\u03b4-function)7 potential wells, each of which can\nsupport a bound state (see Fig.(1) for the \u2032\u2032 + \u2212+\u2032\u2032 case). If we consider the above potential\n6\n\nThe form of the redefinitions depend on the spin of the field.\nIn the infinitely thin brane limit that we consider, the wells associated with positive branes are \u03b4functions.\n7\n\n5\n\n\fV (z)\n\nz\n\nFigure 1: The scenario of multi-localization is realized in configurations where the corresponding form of potential has potential wells that can support bound states. Such a\npotential is the one that corresponds to the \u2032\u2032 + \u2212+\u2032\u2032 model. Positive branes are \u03b4-function\nwells and negative are \u03b4-function barriers.\nwells separated by an infinite distance, then the zero modes are degenerate i.e. and massless. However, if the distance between them is finite, due to quantum mechanical tunneling\nthe degeneracy is removed and an exponentially small mass splitting appears between the\nstates. The rest of levels, which are not bound states, exhibit the usual KK spectrum with\nmass difference exponentially larger than the one of the \"bound states\" (see Fig.(2)). The\nabove becomes clearer if one examines the form of the wavefunctions. In the finite distance\nf\u02c61 +f\u02c62\nconfiguration the wavefunction of the zero mode is the symmetric combination (f\u02c60 = 0\u221a 0 )\n2\n\nof the wavefunctions of the zero modes of the two wells whereas the wavefunction of the\nf\u02c61 \u2212f\u02c62\nfirst KK state is the antisymmetric combination (f\u02c60 = 0\u221a2 0 ). Such an example is shown\nin Fig.(3) where are shown the wavefunctions of the graviton in the context of\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212+\u2032\u2032\n\nmodel with two positive tension branes at the fixed point boundaries and a negative tension\nbrane at the mid-point. From it we see that the absolute value of these wavefunctions are\nnearly equal throughout the extra dimension, with exception of the central region where\nthe antisymmetric wavefunction passes through zero, while the symmetric wavefunction has\nsuppressed but non-zero value. The fact that the wavefunctions are exponentially small in\nthis central region results in the exponentially small mass difference between these states.\nThe phenomenon of multi-localization is of particular interest since, starting from a\nproblem with only one mass scale (the inverse radius of compactification), we are able to\ncreate a second scale exponentially smaller. Obviously the generation of this hierarchy is\n6\n\n\f\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212 +\u2032\u2032 Model\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212\u2032\u2032 RS Model\n\nMass\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of the gravitational spectrum of the \u2032\u2032 + \u2212+\u2032\u2032 model with the\nRandall-Sundrum model.\n\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212\u2032\n\ndue to the tunneling effects in our \"quantum mechanical\" problem.\n\n2.2\n\nLocality - light KK states and separability\n\nSummarizing, if in a single brane configuration (with infinite extra dimension) the zero\nmode of a field is localized on the brane, then in a multi-brane world scenario it will be\nmulti-localized and as a consequence light KK states will appear in its spectrum. The\nlatter is assured from the following locality argument: In the infinite separation limit of the\nmulti-brane configuration physics on each brane should depend on local quantities and not\non physics at infinity. The latter assures the smoothness of the limit of infinite separation of\nbranes in the sense that at the end of the process the configuration will consists of identical\nand independent single brane configurations. As a result the above locality argument also\nensures the appearance of light states which at the above limit will become the zero modes\nof the one brane configurations.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMulti-Localization of spin 0 field\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212+\u2032\u2032 Model\n\nLet us now explore whether multi-localization of spin 0 fields can be realized in the context\nof the RS type of models. We start our discussion from the simplest case of a real scalar\n7\n\n\fFigure 3: The wavefunctions of the three first modes in the \u2032\u2032 + \u2212+\u2032\u2032 model. The zero mode\n(solid line), first (dashed line ) and second (dotted line) KK states. Note that the absolute\nvalue of the wavefunctions of the zero mode and the first KK state almost coincide except\nfor the central region of the configuration where they are both suppressed.\n\nFigure 4: The effect of stretching the configuration by moving the two wells further apart.\nNote that the wavefunction of the zero mode and the first KK state remain localized but\nthe remaining of the modes, not being bound states, will stretch along the extra dimension.\n\n...\n\nFigure 5: The case when the distance between the branes become infinite. The zero mode\n(which still exists if the compactification volume is finite) and the first KK state become\ndegenerate. The wavefunction of the second KK state spreads along the extra dimension.\n\n8\n\n\ffield propagating in a five dimensional curved background described by the metric of eq.(1)\nwhere the function \u03c3(y) is the one that corresponds to the\naction for a massive bulk scalar field in this case is:\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212+\u2032\u2032 configuration. The\n\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\n1Z 4 Z\nS=\nd x dy G GAB \u2202A \u03a6\u2202B \u03a6 + m2\u03a6 \u03a62\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere G = det(GAB ) = e\u22128\u03c3(y) . Under the Z2 symmetry m2\u03a6 should be even. We take m2\u03a6\nof the form:\nm2\u03a6 = C + \u03a3i Di \u03b4(y \u2212 yi )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Di = \u00b11 for a positive or negative brane respectively. The first term corresponds to\na constant five dimensional bulk mass and the second to the coupling of the scalar field to\nboundary sources 8 . The mass can be rewritten in the form\nm2\u03a6 = \u03b1(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2 + \u03b2\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n\n(6)\n\nTaking in account the form of the vacuum, the above action can be written as\nS=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\ndy e\u22122\u03c3(y) \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2202\u03bd \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u22025 (e\u22124\u03c3(y) \u22025 \u03a6) + m2\u03a6 e\u22124\u03c3(y) \u03a62\n\n\u0011\n\n(7)\n\nIn order to give a four dimensional interpretation to this action we go through the dimensional reduction procedure. Thus we decompose the five dimensional field into KK\nmodes\nX\n\u03a6(x, y) =\n\u03c6n (x)fn (y)\n(8)\nn\n\nUsing this decomposition, the above action can be brought in the form\nS=\n\n1X\n2 n\n\nZ\n\nd4 x{\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6n (x)\u2202\u03bd \u03c6n (x) + m2n \u03c62n (x)}\n\n(9)\n\nprovided the KK wavefunctions obey the following second order differential equation\n!\n\ndfn (y)\nd\ne\u22124\u03c3(y)\n+ m2\u03a6 e\u22124\u03c3(y) fn (y) = m2n e\u22122\u03c3(y) fn (y)\n\u2212\ndy\ndy\n\n(10)\n\nwith the following orthogonality relations (taking in account the Z2 symmetry):\n\n8\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n\u2212L\n\n\u2217\ndye\u22122\u03c3(y) fm\n(y)fn (y) = \u03b4mn\n\n(11)\n\nHere we have assumed that the magnitude of the boundary mass term contribution is the same for all\nbranes. This is needed in order to have a zero mode.\n\n9\n\n\fwhere we assume that the length of the orbifold is 2L.\nThe linear second order differential equation can always be brought to a Schr\u00f6ndiger\nform by a redefinition of the wavefunction and by a convenient coordinate transformation\nfrom y to z coordinates related by :\n\ndz\ndy\n\n= e\u03c3(y) . The coordinate transformation is chosen\n\nto eliminate the terms involving first derivatives. Thus we end up with the differential\nequation of the form:\n1\nm2\n\u2212 \u2202z2 + V (z) f\u02c6n (z) = n f\u02c6n (z)\n2\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the potential is given by\nV (z) =\n\n3\n+ m2\u03a6\n2\n\u2212\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n2\n2\n2[g(z)]\n2[g(z)]\n\n15\n(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2\n4\n\n(13)\n\nwhere g(z) \u2261 e\u03c3(y) and we have made a redefinition of the wavefunction:\n3\nf\u02c6n (z) = e\u2212 2 \u03c3(y) fn (y)\n\n(14)\n\nNote that for m\u03c6 = 0 the above Schr\u00f6endiger equation is identical to that of the graviton.\nThis implies that the mass spectrum of a massless scalar field of even parity is identical to\nthe graviton's and thus supports an ultralight KK state(s). Addition of a bulk mass term\n(\u03b2 = 0), results in the disappearance of the zero mode from the spectrum (the ultralight\nstate also is lost). Nevertheless, by considering a mass term of the more general form\n(with \u03b1 6= 0 and \u03b2 6= 0 ), which has the characteristic that it changes both terms of the\n\npotential of eq.(15), we can not only recover the zero mode but in addition have ultralight\nKK state(s). In this case the corresponding potential will be\nV (z) =\n\n\u0010\n\n15\n4\n\n\u0011\n\n+ \u03b1 (\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2\n2[g(z)]2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0010\n\n3\n2\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u0011\n\n2[g(z)]2\n\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n\n(15)\n\nThis is of the general form given in Appendix A. A massless mode exists if \u03b1 = \u03b2 2 \u2212 4\u03b2\nin which case the wavefunction is f\u02c6(z) \u221d e(\u03b2\u22123/2)\u03c3(y) . From equation (11) we see that\nf (y)e\u2212\u03c3(y) \u221d e(\u03b2\u22121)\u03c3(y) is the appropriately normalised wavefunction in the interval [\u2212L, L].\n\nThis is localised on the positive tension brane for \u03b2 > 1 and on the negative tension brane\nfor \u03b2 < 1. When the condition for the zero mode is satisfied we find the mass of the first\nultralight KK state to be given by.\nm1 \u2248\n\n\u221a\n1\n4\u03bd 2 \u2212 1 kw e\u2212(\u03bd+ 2 )x\n10\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere \u03bd =\n\n3\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 and for the rest of the KK tower\nmn+1 \u2248 \u03ben kw e\u2212x\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . .\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03be2i+1 is the (i+1)-th root of J\u03bd\u2212 1 (x) (i = 0, 1, 2, . . .) and \u03be2i is the i-th root of J\u03bd+ 1 (x)\n2\n\n2\n\n(i = 1, 2, 3, . . .). The above approximations become better away from the \u03bd =\n\n1\n2\n\n,x=0\n\nand for higher KK levels, n. The first mass is singled out from the rest of the KK tower\nas it has an extra exponential suppression that depends on the mass of the bulk fermion.\nIn contrast, the rest of the KK tower has only a very small dependence on the mass of the\nbulk fermion through the root of the Bessel function \u03ben = \u03ben (\u03bd) which turns out to be just\na linear dependence on \u03bd.\n\n3.2\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ +\u2032\u2032 model\n\nWe now consider a model which exhibits Bi-gravity but does not require negative tension\nbranes [43]. It is built using two positive tension branes and leads to AdS in four dimensions.\nA discussion of this model appears in Appendix B.\nThe discussion of the localisation of spin 0 fields in the \u2032\u2032 + +\u2032\u2032 case follows similar lines\nto that of the\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212+\u2032\u2032 case. In the absence of any mass term for the scalar the potential\n\nhas the form given in eq.(80) with \u03bd = 23 . Thus again the spectrum of the scalar KK tower\n\nis identical to that of the graviton. However the structure changes on the addition of a\nfive dimensional mass term for the scalar. If one adds a constant bulk mass term there is\nno longer a zero mode and the ultralight state is also lost. In this case, however, it is not\npossible to recover the zero mode and light states by adding a boundary term corresponding\nto coupling to boundary sources. The reason is that a boundary term is no longer equivalent\nto a term proportional to \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (c.f. Appendix B). As a result, up to the constant bulk term\nwe have added, the bulk potential still has the form of eq.(80) with \u03bd =\n\n3\n2\n\nand, due to the\n\nconstant bulk mass term, there is no zero mode. We see that the multi-localisation by a\nconstant bulk plus brane mass term was special to the case with negative tension branes.\nIf one is to achieve the same in the case without negative tension branes it is necessary\nto add a mass term of the form given in eq.(6) which cannot now be interpreted as a five\ndimensional bulk mass term plus a coupling of the scalar field to boundary sources. Note\nthat if one does choose a scalar mass term of the form given in eq.(6) the remainder of\nthe discussion applies to the \u2032\u2032 + +\u2032\u2032 case too and one can generate the multilocalised scalar\nfield configurations discussed above.\n11\n\n\fOf course the question is whether such a scalar mass term can be justified. As we will\ndiscuss in Section 9 supergravity can generate such mass terms in some, but not all, cases.\nFor the remainder it seems unlikely as \u03c3 \u2032 and \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 are related to the metric and the underlying\ngeometry of the compactification and it is difficult to see why a mass term of the form given\nin eq.(6) should arise. One possible explanation may follow if one can realise the ideas of\nreference [32]. In this case the geometry of compactification is driven by scalar field vacua\nwith kink profiles along the extra dimension. Perhaps the coupling to these scalar fields\nwill induce a mass term of the form given in eq.(6).\n\n4\n\n1\n2\n\nMulti-Localization of spin\n\nfield\n\nAs has been shown in Ref. [20] multi-localization can appear also to spin\n\n1\n2\n\nfields with\n\nappropriate mass terms. Here for completeness we briefly review this case. The AdS5\nbackground geometry localizes the chiral zero mode on negative tension branes. However\nthe addition of a mass term [2, 40] can alter the localization properties of the fermion so\nthat it is localized on positive tension branes. The starting point again will be the action\nfor a spin\nS=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nparticle in the curved five dimensional background of eq.(2):\n4\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0010\u2192 \u2190\n\u221a\n\u03c9bcA\n\u2212\u0011\n\u03b1 \u2212\n\u03b1\nbc\nA i\n\u03a8\u0304{\u03b3 , \u03c3 }\u03a8 \u2212 m(y)\u03a8\u0304\u03a8}\ndy G{E\u03b1 \u03a8\u0304\u03b3 \u2202A \u2212 \u2202A \u03a8 +\n2\n8\n\n(18)\n\nwhere G = det(GAB ) = e\u22128\u03c3(y) . Given the convention of of eq.(2) we adopt the \"mostly\nhermitian\" representation of the Dirac matrices. The four dimensional representation of\nthe Dirac matrices is chosen to be \u03b3 a = (\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 5 ) with (\u03b3 0 )2 = \u22121, (\u03b3 i )2 = 1, (\u03b3 5 )2 = 1.\nWe define \u0393M = EaM \u03b3 a and thus we have {\u03b3 a , \u03b3 b } = 2\u03b7 ab and {\u0393a , \u0393b } = 2g ab (y), where\n\u03b7 ab = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1, 1). The vielbein is given by\n\nE\u03b1A = diag(e\u03c3(y) , e\u03c3(y) , e\u03c3(y) , e\u03c3(y) , 1)\n\n(19)\n\nAs in Ref.

The study of the spectrum of the above differential equation provides the spectrum\n(for \u03bd > 12 ): For the first KK state we find (for the symmetric configuration)\nm1 =\n\n\u221a\n\n1\n\n4\u03bd 2 \u2212 1 kw e\u2212(\u03bd+ 2 )x\n\n(28)\n\nand for the rest of the tower\nmn+1 = \u03ben kw e\u2212x\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . .\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03be2i+1 is the (i + 1)-th root of J\u03bd\u2212 1 (x) (i = 0, 1, 2, . . .) and \u03be2i is the i-th root of\n2\n\nJ\u03bd+ 1 (x) (i = 1, 2, 3, . . .). The above approximations become better away from the \u03bd = 12 ,\n2\n\nx = 0 and for higher KK levels n. The first mass is manifestly singled out from the rest of\nthe KK tower as it has an extra exponential suppression that depends on the mass of the\nbulk fermion. By contrast the rest of the KK tower has only a very small dependence on\nthe mass of the bulk fermion thought the root of the Bessel function \u03ben = \u03ben (\u03bd) which turns\nout to be just a linear dependence in \u03bd. The special nature of the first KK state appears\nnot only in the characteristics of the mass spectrum but also in its coupling behaviour. As\nit was shown in Ref. [20] the coupling to matter of the right-handed component of the first\nKK state is approximately constant (independent of the separation of the positive branes)\nIt is instructive to examine the localization behaviour of the modes as the separation\nbetween the two \u03b4-function potential wells increases. In the following we assume that\n\u03bd >\n\n1\n2\n\nso that multi-localization is realized. In the case of infinite separation we know\n\nthat each potential well supports a single chiral massless zero mode and that the rest of\nthe massive modes come with Dirac mass terms. This raises an interesting question: How\nfrom the original configuration with finite size which has only one chiral mode do we end\nup with a configuration that has two chiral modes ? The answer to this question is found\nby examining the localization properties of the first special KK mode. From Figs (3-5) we\nsee that the right-handed component of the first KK state (dashed line) is localized on the\npositive tension brane whereas the left-handed component (dotted line) is localized in the\ncentral region of the configuration. As we increase the distance separating the two potential\n14\n\n\fwells the right-handed component remains localized on the positive tension branes whereas\nthe left-handed state starts to spread along the extra dimension. We see that the second\nchiral mode that appears in the infinite separation limit is the right-handed component of\nthe first KK state. This is possible since in that limit the left-handed component decouples\n(since it spreads along the infinite extra dimension). In this limit, the chiral zero mode that\neach potential well supports can be considered as the combination of the zero mode of the\ninitial configuration and the massless limit of the first KK state.\nOur discussion of fermion localisation applies also to models of the \"+ + \" type without\nnegative tension branes. The major difference is that the fermion mass term are no-longer\nconstant in the bulk. As in the case of the scalars it remains to be seen whether such mass\nterms actually arise in models in which the geometry is determined by non-trivial scalar\nfield configurations.\n\n5\n\nLocalization and Multi-Localization of spin 1 field\n\nWe now turn to the study of an Abelian gauge field. In the context of string theory it is\nnatural to have gauge fields living in their world-volume of D-branes (these gauge fields\nemerge from open strings ending on the D-branes). However, in the case of a domain wall\nit turns out that it is difficult to localize gauge bosons in a satisfactory way. The problem\nhas been addressed by several authors Ref. [32, 53\u201356]. In this section we argue that the\nlocalization of gauge boson fields is indeed technically possible for particular forms of its\nfive dimensional mass term (a similar mass term has been recently considered by [57]). Our\nstarting point is the Lagrangian for an Abelian gauge boson in five dimensions:\nS=\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\u221a \u0014 1 MK NL\n1\n1 \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n2\nM\n\u03bc\ndy G \u2212 G\nG FM N FKL \u2212 \u03b1(\u03c3 (y)) AM A \u2212 \u03b2\u03c3 (y)A\u03bc A (30)\n4\n2\n2\n\nwhere FM N = \u2202M AN \u2212 \u2202N AM . Again we have assumed a mass term allowed by the\nsymmetries of the action of the form:\nm2 = \u03b1(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2 + \u03b2\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n\n(31)\n\nOf course it is important to be able to generate the above mass term in a gauge invariant\nway. This can be readily done through the inclusion in the Lagrangian of the term:\n\u0010\n\n\u03b1(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2 + \u03b2\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n(D M \u03c6)\u2217 (DM \u03c6) \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n\n15\n\n\u0011\n\n(32)\n\n\fHere we have added a five dimensional charged Higgs field, \u03c6. If the potential V (\u03c6) triggers\na vacuum expectation value for \u03c6, it will spontaneously break gauge invariance both in the\nbulk and on the brane and generate a vector mass term of the required form.

As before this can be brought to\na Schr\u00f6dinger form by a redefinition of the wavefunction and by a convenient coordinate\ntransformation from y to z coordinates related through:\n\ndz\ndy\n\n= e\u03c3(y) . Thus we end up with\n\nthe differential equation of the form:\nm2\n1\n\u2212 \u2202z2 + V (z) f\u02c6n (z) = n f\u02c6n (z)\n2\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(39)\n\nwhere\nV (z) =\n\n3\n(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2\n4\n\n1\n+ m2\n2\n\u2212\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n2\n2\n2[g(z)]\n2[g(z)]\n\n16\n\n(40)\n\n\fwhere\n1\nf\u02c6n (z) = e\u2212 2 \u03c3(y) fn (y)\n\n(41)\n\nand we have defined for convenience g(z) \u2261 e\u03c3(y) . Let us now examine the localization\n\nproperties of the gauge boson modes. For m = 0 there exists a zero mode with wavefunction:\n1\nC\nf\u02c6n (z) = Ce\u2212 2 \u03c3(y) = q\ng(z)\n\n(42)\n\nwhere C is a normalization constant. From eq.(38) it is clear that in this case the appropriately normalized wavefunction f (y) is constant along the extra dimension and thus that\nthe gauge boson is delocalized. For m 6= 0 with \u03b1 6= 0 and \u03b2 = 0 the zero mode becomes\nmassive. We can recover the zero mode by allowing for the possibility of \u03b2 6= 0. In this\ncase the potential can be written as\n\nV (z) =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b1+\n\n3\n4\n\n\u0011\n\n(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2\n\n2[g(z)]2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u0011\n\n2[g(z)]2\n\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n\n(43)\n\nThis is of the general form given in Appendix A. A massless mode exists if \u03b1 = \u03b2 2 \u2212\n2\u03b2 in which case the wavefunction f\u02c6(z) \u221d e(\u03b2\u22121/2)\u03c3(y) . From equation (41) we see that\nf (y)e\u2212\u03c3(y) \u221d e\u03b2\u03c3(y) is the appropriately normalised wavefunction in the interval [\u2212L, L].\n\nThis is localised on the positive tension brane for \u03b2 > 0 and on the negative tension brane\nfor \u03b2 < 0. When the condition for the zero mode is satisfied we find the mass of the first\nultralight KK state to be given by (for the symmetric configuration):\nm1 =\n\nwhere \u03bd =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n1\n\n4\u03bd 2 \u2212 1 kw e\u2212(\u03bd+ 2 )x\n\n(44)\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 and for the rest of the tower\nmn+1 = \u03ben kw e\u2212x\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . .\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03be2i+1 is the (i+1)-th root of J\u03bd\u2212 1 (x) (i = 0, 1, 2, . . .) and \u03be2i is the i-th root of J\u03bd+ 1 (x)\n2\n\n2\n\n(i = 1, 2, 3, . . .). Again, the first KK is singled out from the rest of the KK tower as it has\nan extra exponential suppression that depends on the mass parameter \u03bd. In contrast the\nrest of the KK tower has only a very small dependence on the \u03bd parameter thought the\nroot of the Bessel function \u03ben = \u03ben (\u03bd) which turns out to be just a linear dependence in \u03bd.\n17\n\n\fOnce again our discussion applies unchanged to the case without negative tension branes.\nOnce again the difference is that the mass no longer corresponds to a combination of brane\nand constant bulk terms. Perhaps the origin of such terms will be better motivated in the\ncase that the geometry is driven by a non-trivial vacuum configuration of a scalar field with\na profile in the bulk such that coupling of the gauge field to it generates the required mass\nterm. At present we have no indication that this should be the case.\n\n6\n\nMulti-Localization of spin\n\n3\n2\n\nfield\n\nIn this section we consider the (multi-) localization of a spin\nwill be the Lagrangian for a\nS=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n3\n2\n\n3\n2\n\nparticle.

The connection is given by\nAB\n\u03c9M\n=\n\n1 P N [A\n1\ng\ne P \u2202[M eB] N ] + g P N g T \u03a3 e[A P eB] T \u2202[\u03a3 e\u0393 N ] e\u2206\nM \u03b7\u0393\u2206\n2\n4\n\n(48)\n\nwhere \u0393M = eM n \u03b3 n with eM n = diag(e\u03c3(y) , e\u03c3(y) , e\u03c3(y) , e\u03c3(y) , 1). As in the case of the Abelian\ngauge boson we will assume that we generate the mass term for this field in a gauge invariant\nway. Exploiting the gauge invariance we can fix the gauge setting \u03a85 = 0, something that\nsimplifies considerably the calculations.

Thus, one has first to find the appropriate\nvacuum solution and then consider perturbations around this solution.

The exact form of \u03c3(y) depends\n\non the brane configuration that we consider.

In order to examine\n\nthe localization properties of the graviton, the next step is to consider fluctuations around\n\nthe vacuum of eq.(1). Thus, we expand the field h\u03bc\u03bd (x, y) in graviton and KK states plane\nwaves:\nh\u03bc\u03bd (x, y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nh(n)\n\u03bc\u03bd (x)fn (y)\n\n(64)\n\nn=0\n(n)\n\n(n)\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\nwhere (\u2202\u03ba \u2202 \u03ba \u2212 m2n ) h(n)\n\u03bc\u03bd = 0 and fix the gauge as \u2202 h\u03b1\u03b2 = h\n\n=0\n\n10\n\n.

The study of the\nmass spectrum of reveals the following structure for the mass spectrum (for the symmetric\nconfiguration):\n\u221a\nm1 = 2 2ke\u22122x\nmn+1 = \u03ben ke\u2212x\n\n(68)\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . .\n\n(69)\n\nwhere \u03be2i+1 is the (i + 1)-th root of J1 (x) (i = 0, 1, 2, . . .) and \u03be2i is the i-th root of J2 (x)\n(i = 1, 2, 3, . . .). Again the first KK state is singled out from the rest of the KK tower as\nits mass has an extra exponential suppression .\nLet us see now how the separability argument works in the case of the graviton. Starting\nwith the familiar configuration \u2032\u2032 +\u2212+\u2032\u2032 , the mass spectrum consists of the massless graviton,\nthe ultra-light first KK state and the rest of the KK tower which are massive spin two\n10\n\nNote that we have ignored the presence of dilaton/radion fields associated with the size of the extra\ndimension or the positions of the branes. For more details see Ref. [58\u201361].\n\n21\n\n\fparticles. In the limit of infinite separation the first special KK mode becomes the second\nmassless mode, according to our previous general discussions. However, at first sight the\ncounting of degrees of freedom doesn't work: we start with a massive spin 2 state (first\nKK state) which has five degrees of freedom and we end up with a massless mode which\nhas two. It has been shown that in the case of flat spacetime the extra polarizations of the\nmassive gravitons do not decouple giving rise to the celebrated van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov\ndiscontinuity in the propagator of a massive spin-2 field in the massless limit [62, 63]11 .\nHowever our separability argument is still valid: Up to this point we have ignored the\npresence of a massless scalar mode, the radion, which is related to the motion of the freely\nmoving negative tension brane. It turns out that this scalar field is a ghost field, that is,\nit enters the Lagrangian with the wrong kinetic term sign. It can be shown that the effect\nof the presence of this field is to exactly cancel the contribution of the extra polarizations\nof the graviton making the limit of infinite brane separation smooth. Note that apart from\nthe radion there is another scalar field in the spectrum, the dilaton, which parameterizes\nthe overall size of the extra dimension which also decouples in the above limit.\nAs we have mentioned the problems associated with the presence of the ghost radion can\nbe avoided by allowing for AdS4 spacetime on the 3-branes. In this case there is no need\nfor the negative tension brane (thus there is no radion field) and moreover the presence\nof curvature on the branes makes the massless limit of the massive graviton propagator\nsmooth [67, 68], meaning that in the the AdS4 curved background the extra polarizations\nof the massive graviton decouple in the massless limit, in agreement with our separability\nargument.\n\n8\n\nMulti-Localization and supersymmetry\n\nIt is interesting to investigate the multi-localization in the supersymmetric versions of the\nprevious models. The inclusion of supersymmetry is interesting in the sense that it restricts\nthe possible mass terms by relating the mass parameters of fermion and boson fields. It\nis well known that AdS spacetime is compatible with supersymmetry [69, 70]. In contrast\nto the case of flat spacetime, supersymmetry in AdS requires that fields belonging in the\nsame multiplet have different masses. In the previous discussions on the localization of\nthe fields, the mass term parameters which control the localization of the bulk states, are\n11\n\nHowever, in Ref. [64, 65] was shown that in the presence of a source with a characteristic mass scale,\nthere is no discontinuity for distances smaller that a critical one. This argument is also supported by the\nresults of Refs. [66\u201368] where it was shown that the limit is smooth in dS4 or AdS4 background.\n\n22\n\n\fgenerally unconstrained. Let us now examine in more detail the cases of supergravity,\nvector supermultiplets and the hypermultiplet.\nSupergravity supermultiplet The on-shell supergravity multiplet consists of the vielbein e\u03b1M , the graviphoton BM and the two symplectic-Majorana gravitinos \u03a8iM (i = 1, 2).\nThe index i labels the fundamental representation of the SU(2) automorphism group of the\nN = 1 supersymmetry algebra in five dimensions. The supergravity Lagrangian in AdS5\nhas the form [29] (in AdS5 background we can set BM = 0):\n1\nS5 = \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\no\n\u221a h n\n3\ndy \u2212g M53 R + i\u03a8\u0304iM \u03b3 M N R DN \u03a8iR \u2212 i \u03c3 \u2032 (y)\u03a8\u0304iM \u03c3 M N (\u03c33 )ij \u03a8jN\n2\n\n+2\u039b \u2212\nwhere \u03b3 M N R \u2261\n\nP\n\nperm\n\n(\u22121)p M N R\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n3!\n\n\u039b \u2032\u2032 i\n\u03c3 (y)\nk2\n\n(70)\n\nand \u03c3 M N = 21 [\u03b3 M , \u03b3 N ]. From the above expression,\n\nthat is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations [29], we see that the symplecticMajorana gravitino mass term m = 32 \u03c3 \u2032 (y) is such that its mass spectrum is identical to\nthe mass spectrum of the graviton. This becomes clear by comparing eq.(26) for \u03bd =\n\n3\n2\n\nand\n\neq.(66). The latter implies that, in the presence of supersymmetry, multi-localization of\nthe graviton field implies multi-localization of the gravitinos and thus the mass spectrum\nof these fields will contain ultralight KK state(s).\nVector supermultiplet The on-shell field content of the vector supermultiplet V =\n(VM , \u03bbi , \u03a3) consists from the gauge field VM , a symplectic-Majorana spinor \u03bbi , and the real\nscalar field \u03a3 in the adjoint representation.\ni\n\u221a h 1 2\n1Z 4 Z\n2\ni M\ni\n2 2\ni\nij j\nS5 = \u2212\nd x dy \u2212g\n(71)\nF\n+\n(\u2202\n\u03a3)\n+\ni\n\u03bb\u0304\n\u03b3\nD\n\u03bb\n+\nm\n\u03a3\n+\nim\n\u03bb\u0304\n(\u03c3\n)\n\u03bb\nM\nM\n\u03bb\n3\n\u03a3\n2\n2g52 M N\n\nThe above Lagrangian is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations if the mass\nterms of the various fields are of the form (for more details see Ref. [29]):\nm2\u03a3 = \u22124(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2 + 2\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\nm\u03bb =\n\n1 \u2032\n\u03c3 (y)\n2\n\n(72)\n\nAssuming that V\u03bc and \u03bb1L are even while \u03a3 and \u03bb2L odd then the mass spectrum of all the\nfields is identical. This can be easily seen if we note that for the spinors we have \u03bd = 21 ,\n23\n\n\ffor the scalar \u03b1 = \u22124, \u03b2 = 2 and for the gauge boson \u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 = 0. The even fields,\n\nfor the above values of the mass parameters, they obey the eq.(83) of Appendix A with\n\u03bd =\n\n1\n2\n\nwhereas the odd fields obey eq.(84) for the same value of the \u03bd parameter. The\n\nmass spectrum of the two potentials is identical, apart from the zero modes, since they are\nSUSY-partner quantum mechanical potentials. The even fields have zero modes that are\nnot localized (which is expected since the massless gauge field is not localized) in contrast\nto the odd fields that have no zero modes (they are projected out due to the boundary\nconditions).\nHypermultiplet The hypermultiplet H = (H i , \u03a8) consists of two complex scalar fields\nH i (i = 1, 2) and a Dirac fermion \u03a8. In this case the action setup is:\nS5 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\nZ\n\ni\n\u221a h\ndy \u2212g |\u2202M H i |2 + i\u03a8\u0304\u03b3 M DM \u03a8 + m2H i |H i |2 + im\u03a8 \u03a8\u0304\u03a8\n\n(73)\n\nInvariance under the supersymmetric transformations (see Ref. [29]) demand that the mass\nterm of the scalar and fermion fields has the form:\nm2H 1,2 = (c2 \u00b1 c \u2212\n\n3\n15 \u2032\n)(\u03c3 (y))2 + ( \u2213 c)\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n4\n2\n\nm\u03bb = c\u03c3 \u2032 (y)\n\n(74)\n\nfrom the above we identify that \u03b1 = c2 \u00b1 c \u2212\n\n15\n4\n\nand \u03b2 =\n\n3\n2\n\n\u2213 c for the scalar fields.\n\nNote that \u03b1 = \u03b2 2 \u2212 4\u03b2 which implies the existence of zero mode for the symmetric scalar\n\nfields. Moreover, for the scalar fields we find that \u03bd \u2261\n\n3\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 = \u00b1c which implies that the\n\nwavefunctions (in z-coordinates) and the mass spectrum are identical to the Dirac fermion's.\n\nNote that we are assuming that H 1 and \u03a8L are even, while H 2 and \u03a8R are odd. As expected\nif supersymmetry is realized, multi-localization of scalar fields implies multi-localization of\nDirac fermions and the opposite.\nIn the five dimensional AdS background, the mass terms compatible with supersymmetry are not the ones that correspond to degenerate supermultiplet partners, but are such\nthat all members of the supermultiplets have the same wavefunction behaviour and the\nsame mass spectrum. However, in the four dimensional effective field theory description,\nthe states lie in degenerate SUSY multiplets, as is expected since the 4D theory is flat.\n\n24\n\n\f9\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nIn this paper we studied the localization behaviour and the mass spectrum of bulk fields\nin various multi-brane models with localized gravity. We showed that the addition of\nappropriate mass terms controls the strength or/and the location of localization of the\nfields and moreover can induce localization to Abelian spin 1 fields. The localization of all\nthe above fields can resemble that of the graviton, at least in a region of the parameter\nspace. This means that fields of all spins (\u2264 2) can be localized on positive tension branes.\nThe latter implies that in the context of multi-brane models emerges the possibility of\nmulti-localization for all the previous fields with appropriate mass terms. We have shown,\ngiving explicit examples, that when multi-localization is realized the above fields apart from\nthe massless zero mode support ultra-light localized KK mode(s).\nIn the simplest constructions with two positive branes, that we considered here, there is\nonly one special KK state. However by adding more positive tension branes one can achieve\nmore special light states. In the extreme example of a infinite sequence of positive branes\ninstead of discrete spectrum of KK states we have continuum bands. In the previous case\nthe special character of the zeroth band appears as the fact that it is well separated from\nthe next.\nSummarizing, in this paper we pointed out some new characteristics of multi-brane\nscenarios in the case that multi-localization is realized. The new phenomenology reveals\nitself through special light and localized KK states. The idea of multi-localization and\nits relation to new interesting phenomenology is of course general and it should not be\nnecessarily related to RS type models12 , although it finds a natural application in the\ncontext of these models .\nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Tony Gherghetta and Luigi Pilo for\nuseful discussions.

As we have\n\nseen in the previous sections the general form of the potential (for field of any spin) of the\ncorresponding quantum mechanical problem is of the type\nV (z) =\n\n13\n\n:\n\n\u03ba\n\u03bb\n(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2 \u2212\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n2\n2[g(z)]\n2[g(z)]2\n\n(75)\n\nwhere \u03ba, \u03bb are constant parameters14 . For the case of \u2032\u2032 + \u2212+\u2032\u2032 model we have\n(\u03c3 \u2032 (y))2 = k 2\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y) = 2kg(z) [\u03b4(z) + \u03b4(z \u2212 z2 ) \u2212 \u03b4(z \u2212 z1 )]\n\n(76)\n\nz1 and z2 are the position of the second (negative) and the third (positive) brane respectively\nin the new coordinates (z1 = z(L1 ) and z2 = z(L2 )). The convenient choice of variables,\nwhich is universal for fields of all spins, is:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nz\u2261\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n2ekL1 \u2212e2kL1 \u2212ky \u22121\nk\neky \u22121\nk\n\n(the new variable is chosen to satisfy\n\ndz\ndy\n\ny \u2208 [L1 , L2 ]\n\n(77)\n\ny \u2208 [0, L1 ]\n= e\u03c3(y) ) and the function g(z) is defined for\n\nconvenience as g(z) \u2261 e\u03c3(y) \u2261 k {z1 \u2212 ||z| \u2212 z1 |} + 1. Note that in principle \u03ba and \u03bb are not\n\nrelated since the first gets contributions from the five dimensional bulk mass whereas the\nsecond from the boundary mass term.\n13\n\nIn the following expression we have assumed that boundary mass term contribution is universal (its\nabsolute value) for all the branes, i.e. \u03bb is the weight of all \u03b4-functions. One might consider a more general\ncase, where each \u03b4-function to have its own weight. However, generally the requirement of the existence of\nzero mode implies that their absolute values are equal.\n14\nThe particular values of the parameters \u03ba, \u03bb depend on the spin of the particle. Here we are interested\nin the general forms of the solutions. We also assume that we have already performed the appropriate\nredefinition of the wavefunction (f (y) \u2192 f\u02c6(z)), which also depends on the spin of the particle.\n\n26\n\n\fEven fields Let us consider first the case that the field under consideration is even under\nthe reflections y \u2192 \u2212y. In this case, it is easy to show that the zero mode exists only in\n\nthe case that \u03ba = \u03bd(\u03bd + 1) and \u03bb = \u03bd or \u03bb = \u2212(\u03bd + 1) (this is derived by imposing the\nboundary conditions coming from the \u03b4-function potentials on the massless solution, see\n\nbelow). The zero mode wavefunctions in this case have the form:\nIn the case that \u03bb = \u03bd,\nf\u02c60 (z) =\n\nA\n[g(z)]\u03bd\n\n(78)\n\nand in the case that \u03bb = \u2212(\u03bd + 1),\nf\u02c60 (z) = A\u2032 [g(z)]\u03bd+1\n\n(79)\n\nWhere A,A\u2032 are normalization constants. Note that the first is localized on positive tension\nbranes whereas the second on negative tension branes. However, only the first choice gives\nthe possibility of multi- localization on positive tension branes. Thus the existence of zero\nmode and light KK state requires \u03ba = \u03bd(\u03bd + 1) and \u03bb = \u03bd. Since we are interested in\nconfigurations that give rise to light KK states, the potential of interest is:\n\u03bd(\u03bd + 1)k 2\n\u03bd\nV (z) =\n\u2212\n2k [\u03b4(z) + \u03b4(z \u2212 z2 ) \u2212 \u03b4(z \u2212 z1 )]\n2\n2[g(z)]\n2g(z)\n\n(80)\n\nFor the KK modes (mn 6= 0) the solution is given in terms of Bessel functions.

This\nimposes a quantization condition from which we are able to extract the mass spectrum of\nthe bulk field.\nOdd fields In the case that the field is odd under the reflections y \u2192 \u2212y, there is no\nzero mode solution since it is not possible to make it's wavefunction to vanish at both\nboundaries. In the absence of zero mode, the previous restrictions between \u03bb and \u03bd do not\napply - and thus they are in principle independent. However one can ask if in this case,\ndespite the absence of zero mode, a light state can exist. Indeed we can easily find that\nthis can be realized for special choice of parameters: It can be shown that the potential\nV1 (z) =\n\n\u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 1) \u2032\n\u03bd\n(\u03c3 (y))2 +\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n2\n2[g(z)]\n2[g(z)]2\n\n(83)\n\nconsidering odd parity for the fields, gives the same spectrum (apart from the zero mode)\nwith the familiar potential for fields of even parity:\nV2 (z) =\n\n\u03bd(\u03bd + 1) \u2032\n\u03bd\n(\u03c3 (y))2 \u2212\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y)\n2\n2\n2[g(z)]\n2[g(z)]\n\n(84)\n\nwhich according to the previous discussions supports an ultra-light special KK state. This is\nbecause the previous potentials are SUSY partners and as expected have the same spectrum\napart from the zero mode.\n\nB\n\nLife without negative tension branes\n\nIt has been shown that the properties of the\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212+\u2032\u2032 model (the bounce form of the\n\n\"warp\" factor), which contains a moving negative tension brane can be mimicked by the\n\n+ +\u2032\u2032 model, where the negative brane is absent provided that we allow for AdS4 on the\nbranes. Since the corresponding potential has two \u03b4-function wells that support bound\nstates the multi-localization scenario appears also here. The previous results related to the\nlocalization properties of the various fields are valid also in this case. However, the presence\nof AdS4 geometry on the branes, modifies the form of the potential of the corresponding\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation and thus the details of the form of wavefunctions of the KK states.\nIn this section we briefly discuss these modifications.\n\u2032\u2032\n\n28\n\n\fAs previously mentioned, the spacetime on the 3-branes must be AdS4 (in contrast to\nthe \u2032\u2032 +\u2212+\u2032\u2032 models where the spacetime is flat). Thus in this case the background geometry\nis described by:\nds2 =\n\ne\u22122\u03c3(y)\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2\n2 2\n(1 \u2212 H 4x )2\n\n(85)\n\nBy following exactly the same steps as in the case of flat branes, again the whole problem\nis reduced to the solution of a second order differential equation for the profile of the\nKK states. The differential equation is such that after the dimensional reduction the five\ndimensional physics is described by a infinite tower of KK states that propagate in the AdS4\nbackground of the 3-brane. It is always possible to make the coordinate transformation\nfrom y coordinates to z coordinates related through:\n\ndz\ndy\n\n= A\u22121 (y), where A(y) = e\u2212\u03c3(y) ,\n\nand a redefinition of the wavefunction15 and bring the differential equation in the familiar\nSchr\u00f6dinger-like form:\n\u001a\n\n1\nm2\n\u2212 \u2202z 2 + V (z) f\u02c6n (z) = n f\u02c6n (z)\n2\n2\n\u001b\n\n(86)\n\nwhere f\u02c6n (z) is the appropriate redefinition of the wavefunction.\nFor the \u2032\u2032 + +\u2032\u2032 model the form of the potential for fields of different spin is different.\nHowever, in the case that it admits a massless mode and an anomalously light mode it has\nthe generic form given in eq.(80) that applied to the \u2032\u2032 + \u2212+\u2032\u2032 case. However the warp factor\nhas a different form from the case with negative tension branes being given by\ng(z) \u2261 e\u03c3(y) =\n\n1\ncosh(k(|z| \u2212 z0 )\n\n(87)\n\nNote that in this case \u03c3 \u2032 (y) is not constant in the bulk and \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (y) is not confined to\nthe branes. The massless modes, corresponding to the Schrodinger equation with this\npotential,are given by eqs.(75) and (76) as in the\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ \u2212+\u2032\u2032 case. Note however that the\n\nconstraint on the relative magnitude of the two terms in the potential, eq.(72), is now\nrequired when solving for the propagation in the bulk whereas in the case of a negative\ntension brane it came when solving for the boundary conditions.\nThe zero mode wavefunction is given by:\nf\u02c60 (z) =\n15\n\nC\n[cos(k\u0303(z0 \u2212 |z|))]\u03bd\n\nThe form of this redefinition depends on the spin of the field.\n\n29\n\n(88)\n\n\fwhere C is the normalization factor. By considering cases with mn 6= 0, we find the\nwavefunctions for the KK tower :\nf\u02c6n (z) = cos\u03bd+1 (k\u0303(|z| \u2212 z0 )) C1 F (\u00e3n , b\u0303n , 21 ; sin2 (k\u0303(|z| \u2212 z0 )))\nh\n\n+ C2 | sin(k\u0303(|z| \u2212 z0 ))| F (\u00e3n + 21 , b\u0303n + 21 , 32 ; sin2 (k\u0303(|z| \u2212 z0 )))\n\ni\n\n(89)\n\nwhere\n\u03bd+1 1\n\u00e3n =\n+\n2\n2\n\ns\u0012\n\nmn\nk\u0303\n\n\u00132\n\n+ \u03bd2\n\n\u03bd +1 1\nb\u0303n =\n\u2212\n2\n2\n\ns\u0012\n\nmn\nk\u0303\n\n\u00132\n\n+ \u03bd2\n\n(90)\n\nThe boundary conditions are given by:\nf\u02c6n \u2032 (0+ ) + k\u03bd tanh(ky0 )f\u02c6n (0) = 0\nsinh(k(L \u2212 y0 )) \u02c6\nf\u02c6n \u2032 (zL \u2212 ) \u2212 k\u03bd\nfn (zL ) = 0\ncosh(ky0 )\n\n(91)\n\nthe above conditions determine the mass spectrum of the KK states. By studying the mass\nspectrum of the KK states it turns out that it has a special first mode similar to the one\nof the \u2032\u2032 + \u2212+\u2032\u2032 model as expected.\n\nReferences\n[1] K.
