The time-dependent densities of protons and neutrons suggest that\nthe dynamics of giant dipole resonance in neutron-rich nuclei are significantly different\nfrom that in stable nuclei with N \u2248 Z.\n1. Introduction\nAtomic nuclei exhibit a variety of collective modes of excitation. In particular, the giant\nresonances always have been of central interest in nuclear structure and reaction studies.\nThe giant resonances correspond to the most fundamental oscillations in nuclei, in the\nsense that they exhaust major portions of the energy-weighted sum-rule values and that\nthe nucleus strongly absorbs energy from an external field, acting as a whole. Indeed, the\ngiant resonances can be qualitatively described in terms of semiclassical hydrodynamical\nmodels [1].\nAmong many kinds of giant resonances, the isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) is\nthe most famous and exhausts almost 100 % of the sum-rule value. It is well explained\nby ordinary hydrodynamical models. This is rather exceptional because quantitative\ndescription of other modes requires a treatment as a Fermi liquid [1]. There are two\nfamous hydrodynamical models for GDR: the Goldhaber-Teller (GT) model [2] and the\nSteinwedel-Jensen (SJ) model [3]. The GT model predicts A\u22121/6 dependence of the GDR\nfrequencies which arises from the concept that the restoring force is proportional to the\nnuclear surface area. In contrast, the SJ model relaxes the assumption of incompressibility,\nwhich leads to A\u22121/3 dependence of the GDR frequencies. Experimental data are best\nfitted by a combination of these two [4]: In light nuclei, the data seem to indicate the A\u22121/6\nlaw, while the A\u22121/3 dependence becomes increasingly dominant for increasing values of\nA.\nThe hydrodynamical models have a close connection to the time-dependent HartreeFock (TDHF) theory. In the limit of h\u0304 \u2192 0, the TDHF equation goes over into the Vlasov\nequation. Therefore, without the collision term, the TDHF should provide a microscopic\ndescription of an appropriate hydrodynamical model. Recently, we have proposed the\nreal-time TDHF method combined with the absorbing-boundary condition (TDHF+ABC\nmethod) for a linear response function [5,6]. This may be regarded as an extension of the\n\n\f2\ncontinuum random-phase approximation (RPA), made applicable to a deformed system.\nIn this paper, we show real-time dynamics of the TDHF for GDR and discuss how their\nproperties change from stable (N \u2248 Z) to unstable nuclei (N \u226b Z). As is discussed\nin the following sections, we take a small-amplitude limit of the TDHF. Although this\nis equivalent to the RPA, the time-dependent snap shots of the TDHF wave packet may\nprovide an intuitive dynamical picture of the GDR. It should be also noted that the TDHF\nprovides a proper description for low-lying modes as well, for which quantum effects are\nso important that the semiclassical hydrodynamical models are not applicable.\n2. Linearized TDHF in real time\nThe HF ground state is assumed to be a Slater determinant which consists of A singleparticle orbitals, \u03a60 (x1 , * * * , xA ) = det{\u03c6i (xj )}i,j=1,***,A with x = (~r, \u03c3, \u03c4 ). Each singleparticle orbital is determined by\nh[\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ]\u03c6i (x) = \u01ebi \u03c6i (x)\n\nfor i = 1, * * * , A,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h[\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ] is the single-particle Hamiltonian which depends on \u03c6i (x) (i = 1, * * * , A)\nself-consistently. The TDHF equation is obtained by replacing, in Eq. (1), \u01ebi by the\ntime derivative ih\u0304\u2202/\u2202t, and \u03c6i (x) by the time-dependent wave function \u03c8i (x, t). The\nTDHF equation is now linearized with respect to variation of each single-particle wave\nfunction and a time-dependent external field v(x, t). Substituting \u03c8i (x, t) = (\u03c6i (x) +\n\u03b4\u03c8i (x, t))e\u2212i\u01ebi t/h\u0304 into the TDHF equation, we have\n\u2202\n\u03b4\u03c8i (x, t) = (h[\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ] \u2212 \u01ebi ) \u03b4\u03c8i (x, t) + \u03b4h(t)\u03c6i (x) + v(x, t)\u03c6i (x),\n(2)\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03b4h(t) \u2261 h[\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2217 ] \u2212 h[\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ] in the first order of \u03b4\u03c8i (x, t). If we put \u03b4h(t) = 0,\nEq. (2) gives unperturbed particle-hole excitations with a fixed single-particle potential\nin h[\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ]. \u03b4h(t) is nothing but the residual interaction in the language of the energy\nrepresentation. The second term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2) contains a dynamical effect\nwhich comes from variations of the self-consistent one-body potential.\nEquation (2) is equivalent to the well-known RPA equation in the energy representation.\nIn practice, however, there are some differences, advantages and disadvantages in each\nmethod. For instance, the uncertainty in energy, \u2206E, is inversely proportional to the\nperiod of the time propagation T ; \u2206E \u223c h\u0304/T . Therefore, when we want to distinguish\nstates nearly degenerate, we need to propagate the wave functions for a long period of\ntime. In this case, the energy representation may be a better choice. On the other\nhand, when we are interested in a bulk structure of excited states in a wide range of\nenergy, calculations using the time representation becomes more efficient than those with\nthe energy representation. The time-dependent calculation should be suitable for giant\nresonances, since their energies are rather high and spread over a wide range of energy.\nThe transition density in the time representation is defined by the density variation\nfrom its ground-state value,\n\nih\u0304\n\n\u03b4\u03c1(x, x\u2032 ; t) = \u03c1(x, x\u2032 ; t) \u2212 \u03c10 (x, x\u2032 )\n=\n\nA\nX\ni=1\n\n{\u03c6\u2217i (x)\u03b4\u03c8i (x\u2032 , t) + \u03b4\u03c8i\u2217 (x, t)\u03c6i (x\u2032 )} .\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nIn this paper, we are mainly interested in the spin-independent diagonal part of Eq. (3);\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 (~r; t) =\n\nA X\nX\ni=1 \u03c3\n\n{\u03c6\u2217i (x)\u03b4\u03c8i (x, t) + \u03b4\u03c8i\u2217 (x, t)\u03c6i (x)} .\n\n(4)\n\nThe expectation value of an operator F\u0302 (~r, \u03c4 ) can be expressed as\nF (t) = F0 + \u03b4F (t) = F0 +\n\nXZ\n\nd3 r F\u0302 (~r, \u03c4 )\u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 (~r; t),\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c4\n\nwhere F0 is the ground-state expectation value.\nThe external field v(x, t) in Eq. (2) can be chosen according to the purpose of the\ncalculation. In order to calculate the strength distribution in a wide range of energy, an\ninstantaneous external field, v(x, t) = v(x)\u03b4(t), is suitable, because this excites the system\nto states in all energies. In contrast, if we adopt an oscillating field with a fixed frequency\n\u03c9, v(x, t) = v(x) cos(\u03c9t), the system is excited to a specific state with Ex = h\u0304\u03c9. In this\nway, we can investigate dynamical properties of the specific state in the time-dependent\nmanner.\nTo calculate the strength function of the operator F\u0302 (~r, \u03c4 ),\nS(F\u0302 ; E) =\n\nX\n\n2\n\n\u03b4(E \u2212 E \u2032 ) h\u03a8E \u2032 |F\u0302 |\u03a60 i ,\n\n(6)\n\nE\u2032\n\nwe adopt the external field v(x) proportional to F\u0302 (~r, \u03c4 ). Then, S(F\u0302 ; E) can be obtained\nas the Fourier transform of the expectation value of Eq. (5).\nBefore showing results, let us discuss a numerical difficulty related to presence of zero\nmodes in nuclei. The \"zero mode\" means zero-energy modes of excitation associated with\nthe spontaneous symmetry breaking in the HF states, such as translation and rotation.\nThese modes should correspond exactly to the zero energy if the numerical calculation is\nperfect. However, a small numerical error and approximation may give imaginary energies\nto these modes. Since the time evolution of wave functions carries all the information\nof the excited states, the presence of these imaginary-energy modes leads to a kind of\nnumerical instability to prevent performing a long period of the time propagation. Thus,\nwe need to remove components of the zero modes from the time-dependent single-particle\nwave functions \u03b4\u03c8i (x, t). The zero modes can be constructed by operating the symmetry\noperator P\u0302 and its conjugate one Q\u0302 to the ground state. For the translational case, P\u0302 is\nthe total momentum operator and Q\u0302 is the center-of-mass coordinate.\n3. Giant dipole resonances in stable and neutron-rich nuclei\nWe now apply the method to GDR in even-even Be isotopes. We calculated B(E1)\ndistribution for Be isotopes in Ref. [6] using the SIII parameter set. We found that the\nlarge deformation splitting in 8 Be and 14 Be, because of the large quadrupole (prolate)\ndeformation in the ground state (\u03b22 \u2248 0.8). However, the width in 14 Be is much larger\nthan that in 8 Be. These results are robust and do not depend on the choice of the Skyrme\nparameter set. We also found that there is a significant low-energy E1 strength around\nEx = 5 MeV for 14 Be [6]. However, the E1 strength and its peak position are rather\n\n\f4\n0.4\nK=1\nK=0\nTotal\n\n8\n\u22121\n\ndf/dE [ MeV ]\n\nBe\n\n0.2\n\n0\n14\n\u22121\n\ndf/dE [ MeV ]\n\nBe\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\nE [ MeV ]\n\n40\n\nFigure 1.

Thus, in this section, we show time-dependent\ntransition densities for the main peak of GDR.\nThe calculation is performed on the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate grid space,\nusing the Skyrme energy functional of Ref. [7]. The Galilean symmetry is respected in\nthis functional including the spin-orbit, Coulomb, and time-odd densities. We adopt the\nSGII parameter set in the calculation. In order to take account of the single-particle\ncontinuum, we use the absorbing potential outside of the interacting region [5,6]. In\nFig. 1, we show the E1 oscillator strength distribution for 8,14 Be. Two-peak structure due\nto the deformation splitting is prominent for both 8 Be and 14 Be. Hereafter, let us focus\nour discussion on the peak around Ex = 15 MeV with K = 0.\n2\nWe use a Gaussian-pulse external field, v(x, t) = M(E1)K=0 cos(\u03c9t)e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212t0 ) , to selectively excite the GDR around Ex = h\u0304\u03c9 = 15 MeV, with \u03b3 = 3 MeV/h\u0304 and t0 = 2 h\u0304/MeV.\nThen, the spin-independent transition density of Eq. (4) is calculated in the 3D coordinate\nspace. It turns out that one of the Steinwedel-Jensen's assumptions, \u03b4\u03c1n (~r; t) = \u2212\u03b4\u03c1p (~r; t),\nis approximately satisfied for 8 Be. In contrast, in 14 Be, we see a large deviation from this\nproperty. Figure 2 shows how \u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 (~r, t) (\u03c4 = p, n) evolve in time in the x-z plane. The time\ndifference from one panel to the next is \u2206t = 0.2 h\u0304/MeV which roughly corresponds to the\nhalf period \u03c0/\u03c9. We see that significant portions of neutrons actually move together with\nprotons. The neutron transition density \u03b4\u03c1n shows a peculiar node structure. In Fig. 2,\nthe regions of \u03b4\u03c1p > 0 (\u03b4\u03c1p < 0) have a large overlap with the those of \u03b4\u03c1n > 0 (\u03b4\u03c1n < 0).\n\n\f5\n(p1)\n\n(p2)\n\n(p3)\n\n(p4)\n\n(n1)\n\n(n2)\n\n(n3)\n\n(n4)\n\nFigure 2. Snap shots of calculated \u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 (~r, t) in the x-z plane for the K = 0 peak at\nEx = 15 MeV in 14 Be. The upper panels (p1-4) indicate \u03b4\u03c1p (~r; t), while the lower (n14) for \u03b4\u03c1n (~r; t). White (black) regions indicate those of \u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 > 0 (\u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 < 0). The time\ndifference between two neighboring panels is \u2206t = 0.2 h\u0304/MeV. The two panels at the\nsame column corresponds to the same time t.\n\nThis means a violation of the property of the SJ model, \u03b4\u03c1p + \u03b4\u03c1n = 0. Weakly bound\nneutrons in neutron-rich nuclei seem to be significantly affected by strong attraction between protons and neutrons, and to oscillate in phase with protons' movement. This is a\nconsequence of the dynamical effect of the time-dependent self-consistent potential, \u03b4h(t)\nin Eq. (2).\n4. Summary\nWe present calculations of the linearized TDHF method in real time for giant dipole\nresonances in 8,14 Be. These nuclei are calculated to be largely deformed in the ground\nstate. The main GDR peak is split into two peaks with K = 0 and K = 1. We show\nthe time-dependent transition densities for K = 0 peaks. The total density, \u03c1p + \u03c1n , is\napproximately conserved for 8 Be, while its conservation is significantly violated in 14 Be.\nThe time evolution of the transition density, \u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 (t), suggests a strong dynamical effect for\nneutron-rich nuclei, and seems to indicate the mixture of the isoscalar volume-type and\nthe isovector surface-type components.\nThis work has been supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research in Japan\n(Nos. 17540231 and 17740160).
