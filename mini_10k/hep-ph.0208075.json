In general the mass eigenstates\n(\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 , \u03bd4 , ...) do not coincide with the weak (flavour) (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bds , ...) eigenstates, but rather with a linear combination of them\n\u03bdl =\n\nX\n\nUli \u03bdi\n\n(l = e, \u03bc, \u03c4, s, ...; i = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nSuch a mixing could result in neutrino oscillations when the mass differences are\nsmall, and in neutrino decays when the mass differences are large.\nIn this paper we report limits on the square of the mixing strength |U\u03c4 4 |2 between\n\u03bd\u03c4 and a heavy neutrino, \u03bd4 , mostly isosinglet under the Standard SU (2)L gauge\ngroup, with mass in the range 10\u2013290 MeV/c2 . The limits were obtained using the\nnegative result of a search for events produced by the decay of neutral particles into\ntwo electrons performed by the CHARM Collaboration in a neutrino beam dump\nexperiment [1-4]. The decays of the neutral particles, produced in the dumping of\n400 GeV protons in a Cu target, were looked for in a volume located at a distance\nof L = 480 m from the beam dump.\nThe decay detector, shown in Fig.1, has already been described elsewhere [5].\nIt had an empty decay region of D = 35 m length and 3 m \u00d7 3 m surface area\ndefined by a veto scintillator plane (SC1) and a scintillator hodoscope (SC2). The\nvolume was subdivided into three regions using two sets of four proportional tube\nplanes (P1 and P2) [6]. One module of the CHARM fine-grain calorimeter [6] was\ndisplaced to the end of the decay region. In order to improve the resolution of the\nshower angle measurement and to reconstruct better the decay point, three sets\nof four proportional tube planes (P3, P4 and P5) were installed in front of the\nmodule. Lead converters of 0.5X0 each were placed in front of P1, P2, P4 and P5.\nThe detector was parallel to the neutrino beam line at a mean distance of 5 m,\ncorresponding to an angle with respect to the incident proton beam of 10 mrad, and\ncovered a solid angle of 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 sr. The signature of the neutral particles decaying\ninto two electrons would be events originating in the decay region at a small angle\nwith respect to the neutrino beam axis with one or two separate electromagnetic\nshowers.\nThe detector was exposed to a neutrino flux produced by 1.7 \u00d7 1018 protons\non a solid copper target [7] and 0.7 \u00d7 1018 protons on a copper target laminated\nwith an effective density of one-third of that of solid copper [7]. In the combined\nexposures, 21 000 events were collected satisfying the trigger requirements of no hit\nin the scintillator planes SC1 and a hit in at least four out of the six scintillator\nplanes of the calorimeter module. The events were further selected requiring that the\ntransverse co-ordinates of the shower vertex lie in a square of 2.5 m \u00d7 2.5 m centred\non the detector axis and that the electron energy, Eel , measured in the calorimeter module, be larger than 2 GeV. The events recognised as cosmic rays were also\nrejected. The remaining sample of 7185 events is dominated by inelastic scattering of electron- and muon-neutrinos and antineutrinos producing hadron showers.\nCompared with the decay of neutral particles into two electrons, such events have\na broader reconstructed angular distribution because of the intrinsic resolution and\nleakage effects. The regularity of the development of electromagnetic showers was\nused to distinguish further between the signal and the background events. In particular, the distribution of the deviation of the reconstructed direction of the (two)\nshower(s) from that of the incoming beam and the fraction of the energy detected\nby the proportional drift tubes of the calorimeter module outside a narrow cone\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: Layout of the decay detector.\naround the shower were evaluated for the decay events by a Monte Carlo method\n[4].

The\nproduction of strange charm by protons was parametrized using the semi-empirical\nexpression\nf (xF ) \u2248 (1 \u2212 |xF |)n e\u2212bpT2 ,\n(17)\nwhere xF is the meson longitudinal momentum in the collision center of mass frame\n\u221a\ndivided by its maximum value s/2, and pT is the meson transverse momentum.\nSince there are few experimental results available on the production of Ds\u00b1 , the\nvalues of n and b were inferred from the measurements of D production. Assuming\nthe hadronization process to be independent of the cc\u0304 production mechanism, the\nparameters n and b are independent of the meson produced. Most measurements\nagree with a value of b equal to 1 (GeV/c)\u22122 . The used values reported in Table\n1 were obtained by the NA27 Collaboration studying the production of D's in the\ninteractions of 400 GeV protons in an H2 target [13].

In the case of leptonic channels, i = 1 and 2, the spectra\nwere obtained using the matrix element\n|A|2 \u2248 (p\u03c4 * p\u03bdl ) (pl * p\u03bd4 ) .\n\n6\n\n(19)\n\n\fThe quantities p\u03c4 , p\u03bdl , pl and p\u03bd4 are the four-momenta of \u03c4 , light neutrino, electron\nor muon, and heavy neutrino, respectively. The spectrum of heavy neutrino produced by channel 11 was obtained using phase space. The multi\u2013pion decay modes\nwere simulated using two models. In model (a) the spectra of channels 4\u201310 and\ntheir relative contributions as a function of the heavy neutrino mass were computed\nusing phase space [18]. In model (b) channel 4 was assumed to be produced through\nthe resonance \u03c1 and channels 5\u201310 through the resonance a1 . The resonances were\nassumed to have zero width.

The values of Table 3 were computed using the\naverage of the spectra obtained in the two models. The systematic error in Table 1\nreflects the differences of the spectra.\nThe decay (4) was simulated using the matrix element [8]\n\u000e\n\ni\n\nh\n\n2\n(p\u03bd4 * pe+ ) (p\u03bd\u03c4 * pe\u2212 )\n|A|2 \u2248 g\u0303L2 (p\u03bd4 * pe\u2212 ) (p\u03bd\u03c4 * pe+ ) + gR\n\n(21)\n\nwhich neglects the electron mass. The quantities pe\u2212 , pe+ and p\u03bd\u03c4 are the fourmomenta of electron, positron and tau neutrino, respectively. In the center of mass\nof the decaying heavy neutrino the four-vector p\u03bd4 is given by [20]\np\u03bd4 = (m\u03bd4 , \u2212m\u03bd4 |h| ~\u03b7 ) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere ~\n\u03b7 is a unit vector parallel to the direction of the heavy neutrino in the rest\nframe of the particle decaying into neutrino, Ds , or \u03c4 , and |h| is the absolute value\nof the neutrino (antineutrino) helicity. In the case of heavy neutrinos coming from\nDs decay, the values of |h| obtained in Ref. [15] were used. As the polarization of\n\u03c4 produced in Ds decay is negligible, |h| = 0 was assumed for the heavy neutrinos\nproduced in \u03c4 decay. The acceptances and the mean momenta of decaying heavy\nneutrinos expected to be detected in the detector are reported in Table 3 for different\nvalues of neutrino mass. The efficiency of the cut Eel > 2 GeV is about 85% for\nheavy neutrinos coming from Ds and larger than 95% for the ones coming from \u03c4 .\nIn Eq. (12) the probability for a heavy neutrino of energy E\u03bd4 to decay in the\ndecay fiducial volume is given by\nP\u03bd4 \u2192\u03bd\u03c4 e+ e\u2212 (E\u03bd4 ) = e\u2212\n\nL\n\u03bb\n\n\u0010\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\n\nD\n\u03bb\n\n\u0011 \u0393 (\u03bd \u2192 \u03bd + e+ + e\u2212 )\n4\n\u03c4\n\n\u0393tot\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03bb = (\u03b3\u03b2 c)/\u0393tot is the heavy neutrino mean decay path\u0010(\u03b3 = E\u03bd4 /m\n\u0011 \u03bd4 , \u03b2 =\n2\n2\np\u03bd4 /E\u03bd4 ). According to Eqs. (9) and (11) \u03bb depends on |U\u03c4 4 | 1 \u2212 |U\u03c4 4 | .\nThe quantity \u03b5 (m\u03bd4 ) in Eq. (12) is the efficiency of the selection criteria based\non the regularity of the development of electromagnetic showers and the collinearity\nbetween the (two) shower(s) and the neutrino direction. The values, obtained using\na detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the detector response, decrease with increasing\nheavy neutrino mass. It ranges from 91% for m\u03bd4 = 10 MeV/c2 to 65% for m\u03bd4 =\n290 MeV/c2 [4].\nSince no decay event was detected, upper limits at 90% confidence level on\n|U\u03c4 4 |2 were obtained in the neutrino mass range 10\u2013290 MeV/c2 .

(12). Since the contribution to the\nsystematic error of the uncertainty on the spectra of heavy neutrinos coming from\n\u03c4 decay is negligible, Nl does not depend on the neutrino mass. It corresponds to\nan average probability of observing no events, hP0 (Nl )i, equal to 10% [21]:\nhP0 (Nl )i =\n\n+\u221e\nZ\n\nf 0; Nl\u2032 W Nl\u2032 ; Nl , \u03c3 dNl\u2032 = 0.1 ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2212Nl\u2032\n\n(24)\n\nwhere f (0; Nl\u2032 ) = e\nis the Poisson probability of obtaining zero events. In\nthe case of negative Nl\u2032 , f (0; Nl\u2032 ) = 1 was used. The probability density function\nW (Nl\u2032 ; Nl , \u03c3) takes into accounts the systematic errors summarized in Table 1 and\nwas assumed to be a Gaussian distribution. Combining in quadrature the uncertainties reported in the table, one gets \u03c3/Nl = 0.64. In the case of no uncertainty,\nW (Nl\u2032 ; Nl , \u03c3) = \u03b4 (Nl\u2032 \u2212 Nl ) and the integral gives Nl = 2.30: the upper limit at\n90% confidence level for the mean value of a Poisson distribution in the case of zero\nobservations. The chosen value Nl = 6.42 is a safely conservative number: taking\nfor instance W (Nl\u2032 ; Nl , \u03c3) equal to a log-normal distribution to avoid negative values of Nl\u2032 [21], one obtains Nl = 3.21, a factor 2 smaller than the value used in the\nanalysis.\nThe upper limits obtained at 90% confidence level on |U\u03c4 4 |2 values, as a function of m\u03bd4 , are shown in Fig.3, together with previous results [9, 22]. Limits\non |U\u03c4 4 |2 were also obtained for neutrino masses larger than 140 MeV/c2 assuming |Ue4 |2 = |U\u03bc4 |2 = |U\u03c4 4 |2 from the upper bounds on the rates of the decays\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e\u00b1 (\u03bc\u00b1 ) \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u2212 [23]. Limits on |Ue4 |2 and |U\u03bc4 |2 are reported in Ref. [15].\nIn conclusion, the negative results of a search of decays of neutral particles into\ntwo electrons performed by the CHARM Collaboration in a neutrino beam dump\nexperiment, allowed limits to be set at 90% c.l. on the square of the mixing strength,\n|U\u03c4 4 |2 , between \u03bd\u03c4 and a mostly isosinglet fourth neutrino, \u03bd4 , having a mass in\nthe range 10\u2013290 MeV/c2 .
