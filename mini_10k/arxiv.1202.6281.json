Our aim included evaluating the\nsafety of FF-OCT on human tissue and determining the concordance between the images obtained\nwith routinely prepared histopathological material.\nThe compact device used for this study provides a 1.5 \u03bcm-lateral and a 1 \u03bcm-axial resolution, and is\nable to scan a 1.5cm2 specimen in about 7 minutes. 75 breast specimens obtained from 22 patients\nhave been imaged. Because the contrast in the images is generated by endogenous tissue\ncomponents, no biological or chemical contrast agents or specimen preparation are required.\nWe characterized the major architectural features and tissue structures of benign breast tissue,\nincluding adipocytes, fibrous stroma, lobules and ducts. We subsequently characterized features\nresulting from their pathological modification and developed a decision tree for diagnosis. Two\nbreast pathologists applied these criteria, resulting in a demonstrable ability to distinguish between\nnormal or benign tissue, in situ and invasive carcinomas using FF-OCT images, with a sensitivity of\n97% and 90%, respectively, and specificity of 74% and 77% respectfully.\nFF-OCT shows great potential for the evaluation of human tissue and its characterization as\nnormal/benign vs. lesional, for numerous ex-vivo clinical use-cases. Its high imaging accuracy for insitu and invasive carcinoma paves the way for applications where a fast architectural assessment\ncould improve the core needle biopsy workflow and tumor margin assessment.\n\nIntroduction:\nBreast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United\nStates, with an estimated 232,620 new cases and 39,970 breast cancer deaths (39,520 women, 450\nmen) expected in 2011 (1). Nevertheless, in many countries, thanks to more systematic screening\nand better treatment regimens, breast cancer mortality has steadily decreased since 1990, with a\n1\n\n\fdecrease of 3.2% per year in women younger than 50 and of 2% per year for women 50 and older (1).\nEarlier screening allows for the detection of small invasive lesions and in situ carcinomas. For these\nlesions, breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) is standard practice, along with axillary sentinel\nnode biopsy, in cases of invasive carcinoma.\nPrior to definitive curative surgical therapy, routine diagnostic evaluation, usually with needle core\nbiopsy and/or fine needle aspiration, has obviated the need for lesional diagnostic frozen section\nanalysis at the time of surgery (2). In fact, for very small tumors, some have suggested that frozen\nsections may even be inappropriate for lesional diagnosis (3). However, frozen section analysis may\nstill be performed to assess surgical margins, in an effort to minimize the need for a second surgical\nprocedure. Unfortunately, frozen section analysis reportedly only has an overall sensitivity of 73% (45) and is associated with several drawbacks: it is time consuming (20-30min) (6), highly operator\ndependent, destructive to the sample as part of the tissue is lost during slide preparation, allows for\nonly limited sampling, and introduces freezing artifacts (7-11) that significantly hamper\ninterpretation. Alternative techniques for immediate assessment of specimen margins, such as touch\nprep cytology (12) or intraoperative radiography (13), are also fraught with disadvantages, including\npoor sensitivity, limited spatial resolution, and added time. As a result, the re-excision rate is typically\n20%, and may be as high as 40% (5-6, 14-19). Consequently, improvements in the ability to perform\naccurate intra-operative margin assessment using a sub-surface optical microscopic technique is\nattractive, particularly if it is easy to perform, operator independent, non-destructive, fast, and\nprovides for high enough spatial resolution that can mimic traditional histopathological analysis.\nSuccessful optical microscopy has been achieved on excised skin (Mohs surgery) using confocal\nmicroscopy (20) and multiphoton microscopy (21). However, the need for large numerical aperture\nobjectives to \"virtually slice\" the tissue makes confocal microscopy sensitive to tissue-induced\naberrations as well as to the effects of multiple scattering. Alternatively, optical sectioning\ntechniques using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) (22) with a deep red or near infrared sample\nillumination offers many advantages: they are safe, non destructive (no biological or chemical\nmodification), and do not require any exogenous contrast agents that could potentially compromise\nthe tissue integrity for subsequent routine histopathological preparation or molecular testing. In the\ncurrent study, we use the Full-Field OCT (FF-OCT)(23-24) technique to provide large fields of view and\nhigh resolution images of unprocessed breast specimens.\nComparison of FF-OCT to other current imaging techniques\nThe principal imaging techniques comparable to FF-OCT are traditional OCT (22), confocal microscopy\n(25), and Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM) (26).\nNumerous studies have been published during the past few years, demonstrating the suitability of\nOCT imaging for both in vivo and ex vivo tissue diagnosis. OCT has been previously investigated in a\nvariety of tissues such as the eye (27-29), upper aerodigestive tract (30-33), gastrointestinal tract (34),\nbreast tissue and lymph nodes (35-41). One of the earliest studies on human breast tissue showed\nthat benign and malignant lesions could be differentiated using \"Ultrahigh Resolution and Threedimensional Optical Coherence Tomography\" (37), which correlated OCT images with\nhistopathological findings for ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive cancer and micro-calcifications.\nAnother study (38), based on spectral-domain OCT, focused on the assessment of breast tumor\nmargins and demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity. However, this study, involving a\n2\n\n\fsignificant number of patients and images, is specific to tumor margin evaluation and uses diagnostic\ncriteria based on \"large scatterers\" and not on the microscopic morphology. Both these studies of\nbreast tissue utilized techniques that had a limited spatial resolution: the former obtained a 6 \u03bcm\ntransverse resolution and 3.5 \u03bcm axial resolution, while the latter obtained a 6\u03bcm axial resolution\nand 35\u03bcm transverse resolution. Unfortunately, at these resolutions, OCT images appear fuzzy\ncompared to conventional histology. Indeed, in order to satisfy pathologist's requirements, the\noptical technique must mimic that seen with traditional histology : typically a field of view must be\nlarger than a cm2 and the smallest details (spatial resolution) should be closer to 1 \u03bcm.\nTechnically , the FF-OCT setup, described in details in the methods section below, uses immersion\nmicroscope objectives with a numerical aperture of 0.3. This is in contrast to typical OCT setups in\nwhich the numerical aperture is one order of magnitude lower (42) therefore the light scattered by\nsmall sized structures smaller than the wavelength is between 10 (for fiber type ones) and 100 (for\n3-D structures times weaker and are missing in low aperture images; yielding OCT images with\nresolution and contrast that is comparatively much lower than FF-OCT images.\nFurthermore, as it is described in the following section, FF-OCT uses \"en face\" acquisition of the\nimages. Due to this \"en face\" acquisition , FF-OCT offers by far the best lateral resolution. Indeed FFOCT can work without the large depth of field required for time domain, spectral domain, Fourierdomain or swept-source OCT. For these non FF-OCT methods, the available depth range must be of\nthe same order as the depth of field of the objective, therefore requiring low numerical aperture\noptics, which consequently limits the lateral resolution capability to typically 5 to 40 \u03bcm. In contrast,\nthe lateral resolution of FF-OCT is comparable to Optical Coherence Microscopy (24), but its axial\nresolution is better than what could be obtained using super-fast lasers, while facilitating more\nflexibility and a better ability to capture a large field of view.\nImproved resolution has recently been accomplished by combining two techniques: OCT, with its\nlarge field of view, and Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM) with its maximum lateral resolution of 2\n\u03bcm (26). By doing so, it was possible to achieve high-resolution images of small zones with a\nsectioning ability (axial resolution) of 4 \u03bcm. With this improved resolution, the comparison of images\nwith conventional histology of breast tissue is striking, providing an ability to distinguish adipose\ntissue, fibrous stroma, breast lobules and ducts, as well as in-situ and invasive carcinomas. For that\nstudy, the field of view of OCM was limited to 400x400\u03bcm2, utilizing a femtosecond ND:glass laser\nThe large field images can only be obtained using the low axial (4\u03bcm) and transverse (20\u03bcm)\nresolution of the OCT system; at this resolution breast structures appear blurry. High resolution\nimages can only be obtained by switching to OCM which then limits the field of view to 400x400\u03bcm2 .\nOther limitations to the study included the inability to carry out accurate statistical analysis of\nsensitivity and specificity due to few specimens and an inability to determine detection accuracy of\nthe new imaging technology due to non-blinded evaluation of the images.\nPathologists need to be able to identify a zone of interest for assessing the malignancy of a breast\nspecimen. However, with the low resolution of the large field image it can be difficult to identify the\ncorrect zone of interest and the tiny field of view when using OCM represents a major drawback for\nimplementation in the clinical setting.\n\n3\n\n\fIn addition, the cost of an adequate femtosecond laser remains very high. Although laser technology\ncontinues to improve, these lasers remain expensive, often costing as much as the rest of the OCM\nsetup. Large peak power at the focus of ultra fast laser can induce high order photobleaching, similar\nto what has been observed using 2-photon fluorescence (43). Other endogenous chromophores,\nsuch as melanin can limit tissue imaging by causing thermal and mechanical damage during an\nexperiment. Finally using lasers requires supplementary safety requirements. For these reasons,\nOCM is not the best method to use for all tissue imaging application.\nConfocal microscopy (CM) produces high resolution images but the imaging depth is markedly\nlimited. Whereas FF-OCT can show clear signals (contrast and resolution) down to 200\u03bcm in depth\nfor fat and 150\u03bcm in depth for fibrous tissue, the depth is limited to about 50\u03bcm with a confocal\nmicroscope.\nFF-OCT allows a pathologist evaluating large fields to scan the entire biopsy specimen and to follow\nthe morphology at different scales and different positions. The Full-Field OCT (FF-OCT) technique\naccommodates imaging of unprocessed tissue samples down to 200 \u03bcm below the specimen surface\n(depending on the type of tissue), over a large field of view that allows zooming in on specific areas\ndown to the micron scale. More importantly, it should be emphatically noted that no exogenous\ncontrast agent nor any chromophore is required for imaging, as specimens are excised from\nmastectomy pieces and can be analyzed fresh without fixative and directly imaged with no further\npreparation. Utilization of FF-OCT for imaging of both fresh and fixed animal tissue has already\nproven its suitability and performance for high-resolution, large field images (44).\nThe main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the images obtained with FFOCT contain\nsufficient morphologic details that is adequate for a pathologist to make a suitable diagnosis,\ncomparable to that which would be rendered using traditional histological techniques. Specifically, to\nassess the ability to identify various tissue structures, the ability to assess if an area is \"normal\" or\ncontains \"pathology\", and the ability to identify specific histological patterns characteristic of\ncommon pathological entities.\nWe aim to show in the present study that tissue characterization is now possible.\nMaterial and Methods:\nInstrument:\nOCT (22) is a unique technique for imaging scattering media such as biological tissues, by\ninterferometric selection of ballistic photons. It has proved to be an invaluable tool for biomedical\nimaging. In contrast with most of the available OCT approaches (e.g. time domain OCT or Fourier\ndomain OCT), FF-OCT directly takes \"en face\" images using megapixel cameras and microscope\nobjectives. In our setup, a very compact and stable interferometer is displaced to move the focal\nplane at different depths below the surface and to generate 3D tomographic images(45). En face\ncapture allows FF-OCT to operate with high lateral resolution (typically ~1\u03bcm) using medium to large\naperture microscope objectives (46). Nevertheless, the penetration of the beam into the volume of\nthe sample induces a shift between the focus and the sectioning plane due to refractive index\nmismatch. In order to compensate for this phenomenon and the aberrations that may take place, a\nreal time optimization of the signal is achieved (47).\n4\n\n\fThe principle of FF-OCT relies on low coherence interference microscopy. The experimental\narrangement of FF-OCT (Figure 1) is generally based on a configuration that is referred to as a Linnik\ninterferometer (48). A halogen lamp is used as a spatially incoherent source to illuminate the whole\nfield of a immersion microscope objective. Due to the low temporal coherence of the source,\ninterference occurs only when the optical path lengths of the two-interferometer arms are identical\nwithin typically 1\u03bcm, which is equal to the effective coherence length of the source (taking into\naccount the camera spectral response) divided by 2n, n being the refractive index of the sample.\nWhen a biological object is placed under the microscope objective in the object arm, the light\nreflected by the reference mirror interferes with the light reflected or backscattered by the sample\nstructures contained in a limited volume that is a slice orthogonal to the objective axis, located at a\ndepth inside the object defined by an optical path length difference of zero. The signal is extracted\nfrom the background of incoherent backscattered light using phase-shifting method.\nTaking \"en face\" images allows an easy comparison with histological sections. The resolution, pixel\nnumber and sampling requirements results in a field of view that is limited to about 1mm2. Histology\nsections are typically ~1 cm2 and a pathologist typically evaluates tissue at several magnifications\nwhere field of view varies from cm down to \u03bcm, in order to make a reliable diagnosis. For this reason,\nwe move the sample on a high precision mechanical platform and we stitch a number of images to\ndisplay a significant field of view (49).The FF-OCT technology is utilized to build a compact setup (fig 1)\nthat is about the size of a standard optical microscope (310x310x800mm L x W x H) and for this study,\nwas located in the laboratory room used for frozen section analysis (Figure 1B). It is quiet and does\nnot create any unwanted heating, lighting or sound in the room.\nImaging protocol:\nWritten consent was obtained prior to imaging according to the standard procedure in the hospital\nTenon (Paris) for each patient undergoing biopsy or surgical resection.\nSample selection:\nFor each patient we imaged at least 4 tissue samples, each averaging 1-1.5cm2: one sample from the\ntumor, one at the edge of the tumor, and 2 samples from adjacent normal appearing parts of the\nspecimen. Gross examination alone was used to identify the tumor. The size of the tissue samples in\nthis study is considered comparable to the size of those typically acquired and used for frozen section\nanalysis.\nSample preparation\nThe sample tissue was placed in a sample holder and immersed in a saline solution. A specially\ndesigned cover slip was carefully placed on the specimen in order to create a flat surface and to\nreduce optical aberrations. The specimen was raised and gently pushed against the cover slip by\ndisplacing the sample holder piston. The holder was then placed under the immersion objective of\nthe microscope. Optical oil was added on top of the cover slip to ensure a continuous optical path.\nThe specimen is then protected from the environment and is isolated from the air and the objective\nimmersion liquid.\n5\n\n\fImage acquisition:\nAfter the FF-OCT imaging procedure, the samples were fixed in formalin and subjected to routine\nprocessing including paraffin embedding, sectioning and HES staining at the same estimated depths\nthan the imaging depth. For consistency, our comparison between images acquired by FF-OCT and\nhistology preparations has been primarily performed with images taken at 20\u03bcm below the cover slip,\nsince this depth corresponds to the least attenuated signal on the FF-OCT images and the most\nrepresentative sections of the paraffin embedded block. Nevertheless, as noted above, signal from\nbreast specimens is detected up to 150\u03bcm for the fibrous part and up to 200\u03bcm for the fat one.\nAll FF-OCT images were taken using a non-inversed linear look up table (LUT) scale. Thus, the hyposcattering structures appear black, whereas the hyper-scattering structures appear white.\nIn most cases, in order to facilitate the comparison with HES stained slides, the entire tissue sample is\nimaged. The resulting slides were then scanned to produce whole slide images for use as\ncomparative images.\nStudy protocol:\n75 breast specimens were imaged from 22 patients (21 women, 1 man) with a mean age of 58 (range\n25-83). A total of 193 images were acquired. In most cases, samples were selected from freshly\nexcised and fixed radical mastectomy specimens, e.g. large malignant or multifocal tumors, benign\nmacroscopic lesions and/or normal appearing tissue present in other areas of the same breast.\nImages on fresh tissue offer a better contrast, and all figures in this manuscript are from fresh\nspecimens. Nevertheless images from fixed specimens were easily interpretable by the pathologists\nand we included images from both fresh and fixed specimen in the sensitivity and specificity study.\nThe samples included normal appearing tissues as well as a large range of breast lesions from men,\npost- and pre-menopausal women. No discrimination has been made regarding the patient's age or\nhealth status, therefore allowing for inclusion the broadest selection of breast tissue and\nverification that malignancy assessment could be made on any type of tissue.\nIn most cases, samples were selected from freshly excised radical mastectomy specimens, e.g. large\nmalignant or multifocal tumors, benign macroscopic lesions and/or normal appearing tissue present\nin other areas of the same breast. A selection of the cases to be sampled was made in order to be\nable to image a larger amount of different lesions with different macroscopic appearance (nodular or\nstellate) and different histological types of invasive carcinoma. This information was available from\npre-operative diagnoses (mammography and needle core biopsy). Most patients had more than one\ndiagnosis classification associated with their histopathological assessment.\nThe study was conducted in three phases:\nPhase 1: The safety of FF-OCT on human breast tissue was evaluated. Samples were imaged and then\nprocessed for routine standard histopathology. The specimens imaged by FF-OCT were assessed for\nany adverse impact on tissue architecture revealed by HES staining or on immunophenotype\nassessed by immunochemistry.\nPhase 2: The goal of this phase was to highlight the main architectural features of human breast\n6\n\n\ftissue in our images, by comparing these images with standard histopathology slides prepared from\nthe same specimens. This phase facilitated the delineation of the main architectural features seen in\nhuman breast tissue, which can be utilized to interpret and characterize the normal/benign and\nmalignant nature of the lesions.\nPhase 3: Pathologists were blinded to final histological diagnosis, and were asked to determine based\non the FF-OCT image features alone if the specimen was normal/benign or malignant. They receive\nno macroscopic images of the samples and did not review the histological slides or whole slide\nimages produced from them. The test was conducted long after surgery to prevent any possible\nfamiliarity with the case, and the pathologists had no pre-operative assessment information for any\nof the patients.\nResults:\nFinal histopathological diagnoses included 3 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma, 7 cases of invasive\nductal adenocarcinoma, 6 cases of lobular carcinoma in situ, 6 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, 1\ncase of invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and 1 case of ductal hyperplasia.\nPhase 1: Safety\nSamples were imaged using FF-OCT under conditions used in phases 2 and 3 described below.\nSix additional radical mastectomy specimens were included in this part of the study. After imaging\nprocedure, tissue architecture was assessed by gold standard histopathology and compared to\nhistological sections corresponding to other specimens of the same region of the breast that did not\nfollow the imaging procedure.\nIn the case of carcinoma specimens, usual markers tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) involved in\ntumor evaluation were quantified in order to verify that FF-OCT imaging procedure does not alter the\nparameters usually tested. Thus, the signal of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors, Cerb B2\n(Her2/neu), ki-67 and E-Cadherin was evaluated and quantified on tumor samples that were imaged\nwith FF-OCT and compared to tumor samples from the same patient that did not follow the imaging\nprocedure.\nIn the case of normal breast tissue specimen, the signal of other IHC markers such as cytokeratin(CK)\n7, 14, 18, 5/6 and vimentin was evaluated and quantified on samples imaged with FF-OCT. The signal\nobtained was compared to their usual expected signal on normal breast tissue.\nAfter comparison, the value of the different markers for evaluation of the tumourous specimens\nimaged with FF-OCT were the same as those obtained with matched control specimens from similar\nregions of the specimen that were not imaged with FF-OCT prior to processing.\nFor normal breast tissue, the localization of the signal of the different types of CK and vimentin was\nthe same as the expected signal on normal breast tissue.\nTherefore, we have shown that no alterations in any of the parameters assessed (histopathology and\nimmunohistochemistry) were observed due to FF-OCT procedure.\nThe total acquisition and image rendering time for a 1,5cm2 breast specimen is 7 minutes. Sample\n7\n\n\fpositioning in the sample holder and initialization of the device is 5 minutes long. Together, these\nmake up to the complete imaging procedure requiring only 12 minutes, significantly shorter than\nwhat is typically required for frozen section analysis (20-30 min).\nPhase 2 : Correlation of the morphologic features in FF-OCT images with gold standard\nhistopathology\nPart 1 : Breast tissue characteristics recognition\nAfter safety assessment of this technique, we focused on distinguishing morphologic features\nexpected in breast tissue on FF-OCT images. This analysis also provided study pathologists with an\nopportunity to familiarize themselves with the images. We focused on morphological features that\nwere distinguishable in whole slide images of conventional histological preparations and FF-OCT\nimages.\nBy conducting a comparative analysis with normal breast tissue, we (MA and BSZ) were able to\nrecognize and characterize morphologic features of the major components of breast tissue in the FFOCT images, including fibroadipose tissue, epithelial ducts, vasculature and fibrous tissue (Figure 2).\nFor example, we found that the galactophorous ducts, when cut tangentially, are recognizable by\nlight grey color, which we hypothesize is generated by their highly scattering thick elastic membranes\n(Figure 2C). In contrast, the same glands, when cut longitudinally, exhibit a characteristic epithelial\nlayer of varying thickness that appears dark grey (Figure 2B). Intraluminal secretions are sometimes\nidentified. The lobules (Figure 2A) are identified as dark grey granular rounded structures. The\nvessels (Figure 2D), when cut tangentially, do not have the thick epithelial layer of the\ngalactophorous ducts, but are also associated with the presence of an elastic membrane. The\nadipocytes (Figure 2E) are hypo-scattering, and appear as black rounded structures. Their\nmembranes produce more scattering and appear grey. The characteristic honeycomb configuration\nof the fat cells is easily identified. The healthy fibrous tissue appears grainy with medium backscattering signal (Figure 2G). The fibrous tissue in the stroma is made of hyper-scattering trabeculae\n(Figure 2H). The scar fibrous tissue is made of thick and large trabeculae, less scattering than the\nstroma. Calcifications appear white (Figure 2C) due to their very high backscattering levels.\nThe high resolution of the FF-OCT technique enables the visualization of the very thin membranes of\nthe vessels and those of the adipocytes (Figure 2D, 2E).\nOur large scale images display most of these structures that define our grey scale: dark equals\nabsence of tissue or adipocytes, white equals fibrous and dense tissue.\n\nPart 2: Distinction between benign/normal and malignant tissue\nAfter gaining an understanding of the normal morphologic features of human breast tissue\nappearance in our images, we next focused on discerning what aberrations of these morphologic\nfeatures images would facilitate characterization of the tissue as benign/normal or malignant. The\nanalysis produced a distinct set of criteria that needs to be satisfied for accurate distinction between\nbenign/normal and malignant tissue, along with a recommended workflow that should be followed\nto make the determination. The workflow and criteria are presented as a flowchart in (Figure 3), and\n8\n\n\fbriefly outlined below.\n1) First, assess the FF-OCT images using the criteria used for low magnification assessment of\nstandard histology slides. These would include features such as the presence or absence of stellate\nlesions, and the entanglement of the adipose and fibrous tissues.\n2) If there is no evidence of tumor at low magnification, it is necessary to verify the presence of intact\nnormal breast tissue structures such as lobules, galactophorous ducts and vessels.\n3) If there is no obvious tumor and there is no evidence of intact normal structures, the following\ncriteria for reading the FF-OCT images must be used.\na) Assess the shrinkage of the adipose tissue, which is characterized by the presence of\nadipocytes of different sizes at the periphery of an invasive carcinoma. In most cases, at the interface\nof the lesion, fat cells appear smaller and less rounded.\nb) Search for the presence of grey zones, typically surrounded by white fibrous structures\n(corresponding to foci of carcinoma surrounded by fibrous tissue).\nc) Assess the color and the morphology of this fibrous tissue. The appearance of the fibrous\ntissue is different depending on the type of collagen present. In FF-OCT images, the fibrous tissue of\nmalignant tumor-associated stroma is very white, while it is greyer for scar-associated fibrous tissue\nor normal/benign breast fibrous tissue. Furthermore, the fibrous tissue architecture differs, usually\nappearing as thin trabeculae in malignant tumor associated stroma, while appearing as thick\ntrabeculae associated with reactive/reparative change (i.e. wound tissue) (Figure 2F). Trabeculae are\nnot seen in normal or benign fibrous tissue (Figures 2F, 2G, 2H).\n\nFigure 4 consists of an image from normal breast tissue of a post-menopausal woman and the\ncomparable whole slide image of the conventional gold-standard histology preparation. The image\nshows the characteristic structures of breast tissue such as the lobules, galactophorous ducts,\nadipocytes and a normal fibrous tissue. There is some entanglement of the fibrous tissue and adipose\ntissue noted.\nThe fibrous tissue appears grainy with a medium back scattering level. Ducts are cut longitudinally;\nthus they look dark grey. Digital zooming of the image reveals acini in the lobules.\nNext, in Figure 5, two types of invasive carcinoma can be seen: a stellate tumor (Figure 5A-B) and a\nnodular one (Figure 5F-G). In both lesions, the trabeculae of the highly scattering tumor-associated\nfibrous tissue can be observed (Figure 5D, 5H). This is contrast to the normal fibrous tissue that\nappears grainy and produces less scattering (Figure 5I). Furthermore, tumor-associated adipocytes\nare smaller than the ones outside of the tumor (Figure 5E). In the stellate tumor (Figure 5B), the\nfibrous tissue is seen invading the adipose tissue. In the nodular tumor (Figure 5G), foci of carcinoma\ncells appear as grey zones surrounded by the highly scattering tumor-associated fibrous tissue\ntrabeculae (5H). A circular dilated duct with secretion in the lumen is visible in the center of the\nnodule. The different aspect of fibrous tissue defines the tumor margins on Figure 5G.\nFigure 6 shows an invasive ductal adenocarcinoma with an associated ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS)\n9\n\n\fcomponent. Enlarged lobules and ducts filled with DCIS (Figure 6C, 6D) are clearly visible on the\nimage. In addition, the invasive component is characterized by the presence of highly scattering\nfibrous tissue (Figure 6B) and foci of darker grey carcinoma cells (Figure 6D).\n\nA fibroadenoma is shown in Figure 7D and the enlarged ductules (Figure 7E) characteristics of this\nbenign lesion are easy to distinguish in the FF-OCT image. DCIS is noted in Figure 7A, characterized by\nenlarged abnormal lobules (Figure 7C) and ducts (Figure 7B), which can be distinguished easily by\ndigital zooming of the image. The acini in the enlarged lobule are clearly visible and the narrow\nlumen in the duct is indicative of malignancy.\nPhase 3: Assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of FF-OCT\nUsing the above-mentioned workflow and criteria set, 70 and 73, respectfully, breast tissue sample\nimages were reviewed by 2 senior-staff breast pathologists (MA and BS). In isolation of the\nhistopathology or medical history, each classified the images into two diagnostic categories:\nnormal/benign or malignant. Following completion, their designations were compared to the\ndiagnosis based on the gold-standard histopathology preparations of the same tissue used to\nproduce the FF-OCT images. The analysis of the first breast pathologist (MA) yielded 28 true positives,\n30 true negatives, 3 false negatives and 9 false positives, giving a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity\nof 77%. The analysis of the second breast pathologist (BSZ) yielded to 30 true positives, 28 true\nnegatives, 1 false negative and 14 false positives giving a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 74%.\nNote that for each pathologist, a few images (5-MA, 2-BSZ) were considered uninterpretables,\nprimarily due to a non optimal positioning of the sample under the glass plate used with the sample\nholder, thus resulting in acquired images at a depth at which the whole sample area was not optically\nsliced and therefore not entirely visible on the resulting image.\n\nDiscussion:\nIn this benchmark pilot study, we describe the first pre-clinical evaluation of FF-OCT for ex-vivo\nhuman breast tissue analysis and its ability to facilitate interpretation for tissue diagnosis. First, we\nhave shown that the technique is safe, producing no demonstrable alterations that affect\ninterpretation of conventional histology preparations following imaging, or any alteration in the\nability to perform immunohistochemistry for a variety of epitopes. Next, using the images produced,\nwe have demonstrated an ability to assess the microstructure of normal human breast tissue\nincluding glands, lobules, galactophorous ducts, and adipose tissue. Lastly, we have developed a set\nof initial criteria and a recommended workflow for interpreting FF-OCT images which can accurately\ndifferentiate whether the alterations observed are benign/normal or malignant. In many cases, a\nspecific histopathological diagnosis can be made by the pathologist, such as invasive carcinoma,\ncarcinoma in-situ, and benign fibroadenomas.\nFF-OCT is the first ultra-high resolution optical imaging technique that combines the possibility of\nobtaining breast tissue images over an adequately large area, while producing images of sufficiently\nhigh resolution, thereby allowing pathologists to mimic routine histopathology diagnostic workflow\n10\n\n\fby zooming in and out on the images. We have established a diagnostic decision tree, which would\nallow pathologists to classify tissue as malignant or benign/normal. While the values obtained for\nsensitivity and specificity could indeed be improved, it is important to note that this diagnostic\naccuracy assessment was totally blinded to any clinical information or context, and that the breast\ntissue remains a very complex organ, with numerous potential histopathological entities.\nWhile the current study has only a limited sample size, and concentrates on a single organ system,\nthe lessons acquired from this initial pilot study will help with the design of future evaluations of\ntissue samples from all the major organ systems.\nWe propose that in its current stage of development, FF-OCT imaging technique has great potential\nfor several use cases. First, it represents a paradigm shift in the handling of immediate assessment of\nresected tissue. For the first time, it allows for primary digital acquisition of enough information to\nallow pathologist to meaningfully interpret the morphologic features of tissue, on fresh tissue in a\nnon-destructive manner. The lack of need for sample preparation and rapid image capture has the\npotential to significantly reduce the time it takes to provide this interpretation surgeons. For certain\ntypes of frozen sections, such as margin assessment, it has potential to diminish the need for a reexcision and improve post-operative prognosis. Because it is non-destructive, it has great potential to\nfar exceed our current ability to perform both immediate and routine assessment of high risk, small\nbiopsy specimens, such as those obtained from central nervous system tumors. In fact, it could be\nused to carry out immediate or permanent assessments of tissue biopsies in a variety of contexts. For\na typical core needle biopsy with a surface area of 0.2 cm2, imaging can be accomplished in about 1\nminute. This would then allow for additional testing of the tissue, particularly in cases where fresh\nnon-fixed, non-paraffin embedded tissue is required.\nIn vitro application of this technology may also be evaluated for both clinical and research tissue\nbanking (where tissue is cryopreserved for future use, such as DNA or RNA extraction). In oncology,\nthe diagnosis and treatment of tumors frequently requires molecular diagnostic information (i.e.\ngene mutations, translocations, amplifications) to inform targeted therapy. The optimization of these\ntechniques on small biopsy samples is crucial for the pathologist, the clinician and the patient,\nparticularly those who have advanced or metastatic, and thus inoperable, cancer. The fact that the\nFF-OCT technology does not consume the tissue and does not induce alterations is a real advantage.\nMoreover, the standard procedures in a typical pathology laboratory (e.g., embedding tissue,\nsectioning of a paraffin-embedded tissue with the microtome, frozen section preparation with a\ncryostat) are still not automated. Thus, these procedures are time consuming and require expert\ntechnical personnel. However, it is now possible to foresee the pathology laboratory of the near\nfuture, where \"triaging\" of specimens by FF-OCT could significantly streamline the workflow, such\nthat only truly important specimens are paraffin-embedded and processed for gold standard\nhistopathology.\nFinally, in vivo application of FF-OCT technology for endoscopic evaluation will be very helpful for\nclinicians and surgeons. By utilizing FF-OCT endoscopy, the clinician and pathologist can better\nevaluate the nature of a suspicious lesion, providing better targeting for areas to sample, decreasing\nnon-diagnostic specimens reaching the lab for conventional histopathological assessment. Such\napplications are foreseeable for cancers of the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, the urinary\ntract and the male and female reproductive tracts. During many of these procedures, for example,\n11\n\n\fthe surgeon is unable to palpate the organ directly, limiting their ability to appreciate tactile nature\nof the possible neoplasm. Consequently, we have recently developed a 2mm-diameter rigid probe\nand are currently obtaining preliminary results on in vivo breast tissue imaging with this experimental\nsetup (50).\nAcknowledgments:\nGrant Support: This work was supported in part by Institut National du Cancer (INCA/ONCODIAG\nn\u00b02009-1-PL BIO 16-ESPCI-1) and by the foundation Pierre Gilles de Gennes pour la recherche.\nWe would like to thank Eolia Flandre for performing histological sections used for this work.\nReferences:\n1.
