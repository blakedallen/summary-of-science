Since giant planets in the habitable zone are thought to have migrated there, it is possible\nthat they may have captured a former terrestrial planet or planetesimal. We therefore attempt to\nmodel the dynamical evolution of a terrestrial planet captured into orbit around a giant planet in\nthe habitable zone of a star. We find that approximately half of loose elliptical orbits result in stable\ncircular orbits over timescales of less than a few million years. We also find that those orbits are\nmostly low-inclination, but have no prograde/retrograde preference. In addition, we calculate the\ntransit timing and duration variations for the resulting systems, and find that potentially habitable\nEarth-mass exomoons should be detectable.\nSubject headings: planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability - celestial mechanics\n1. MOTIVATION\n\nExomoons, the satellites of extrasolar planets, have\nbeen often featured in fiction as habitable locations.\nThere is no deficit of known giant planets; Exoplanet.org\n(Wright et al. 2010) lists approximately 40 giant exoplanets (8% of total) within 20% of the equilibrium temperature of Earth, as are 30 (3%) of the Kepler planet\ncandidates released in February 2011 (Borucki et al.\n2011). Though these observations are preliminary, they\ndo show that habitable-zone giant planets not only exist, but are common. Once a giant planet is known to\nbe in a habitable zone, variations in its orbit, such as\nTransit Timing Variation (TTV; Sartoretti & Schneider\n1999) and Transit Duration Variation (TDV; Kipping\n2009), photometry (Szab\u00f3 et al. 2006), or gravitational\nmicrolensing (Liebig & Wambsganss 2010), allow the indirect detection of satellites. Thus, if potentially habitable exomoons exist around transiting giant planets,\nthey may be detected at the same (or even greater) rate\nas solitary habitable terrestrial planets. As yet, no exomoons have been detected, but the wealth of transit data\nfrom the Kepler mission should begin to fill this gap.\nDespite the existence of giant planets in stellar habitable zones, it is far from certain how they arrived there.\nCurrent giant-planet formation models assume that they\nare created at distances beyond the stability point of ice\n(e.g. Lissauer 1987; Boss 1997), which implies conditions\nnot suitable to surface habitability. Disk migration can\nbring giant planets close to the star (Ward 1997), but\ngenerally has a stopping point far too close to the star\nto be habitable (thus producing \"Hot Jupiters\"). The\nhost planets of potentially habitable exomoons therefore likely arrived at their final orbit through late-stage\nmigration, driven either by planetesimals (Kirsh et al.\n2009) or other giant planets (Weidenschilling & Marzari\n1996).\nporter@lowell.edu\n\nIn the process of migrating, the satellite systems of\nthese giant planet may have close encounters with terrestrial planets or planetesimals, causing them to be disrupted or replaced. If either the Jovian or Saturnian\nsystems were transported to 1 AU around a solar massstar, both Callisto and Titan would be at 18% of their\nplanet's Hill radii, thus implying that all the major satellites of the two planets would be on stable orbits. However, a close encounter could either excite their orbits to\nhigh eccentricity (thus requiring tidal recircularization),\nor could result in the capture of a much larger terrestrial\nsatellite. Neptune appears have to experienced this process during its migration through the proto-Kuiper Belt,\nloosing any original major satellites, while gaining Triton in an inclined, retrograde orbit. This was possibly\ndue to a momentum-exchange reaction that ejected the\nbinary companion of Triton (Agnor & Hamilton 2006),\nthough other scenarios are possible (at reduced probability). Any capture process, though, will tend to produce\nvery loosely-bound initial orbits, with only a small deltav to escape velocity at periapse. Therefore, some method\nmust be used to determine the long-term evolution and\nstability (or lack thereof) for these orbits. Here we use\na full KCTF (Kozai Cycle and Tidal Friction) model to\nfind the survival probability for a range of physical conditions and the detectability of the resulting system.\nAs shown by Donnison (2010) and Sato & Asada\n(2010), there are a range of stable orbits for Earth-mass\nplanets around giant planets. However, both of those\nmodels test only the stability of the orbit, rather than\nany evolution due to tidal effects. On inclined exomoon\norbits, the effects of stellar torques on the orbit can,\nthrough initiating Kozai cycles, dramatically accelerate\nthe rate of tidal decay, orbit circularization, and spinorbit synchronization. As we will show, this process can\nallow even very loose, inclined capture orbits to stabilize\nto tight, circular orbits. Thus, even marginal dynamical\ncaptures of former terrestrial planets can produce stable\n\n\f2\n+,\n\n$! %& '\"\n'\n\n#\n\n(\n\n#\n\n)\n\n*\n\n!\n\n-\n\n+\n\n! \"\n!\n\n#\n\nFig. 1.- Post-capture spin-orbit evolution of two exomoons; the\nsolid line shows a Kozai-enhanced decay, while the dashed line\nshows a non-Kozai decay.\n\nexomoons.\n\nFabrycky & Tremaine (2007) for a Jupiter-mass planet.\nThe tidal properties of the exomoons used the formulation of Ragozzine (2009), along with his addition of\nsolid-body quadrapole gravity. To integrate the system\nof equations, we used the Burlisch-Stoer method with\nvector-rational interpolation (Sweatman 1998) and error control based on the algorithm given in Press et al.\n(2007), with a per-timestep tolerance of 10\u221210 .\nThis model does not include any dynamical effects from\nobjects external to the exomoon-exoplanet system other\nthan the star itself. In addition, we assumed that the\nplanet did not migrate over the course of the simulation.\nIf it were to migrate, the effect would be to shrink the Hill\nradius of the planet and shorten the period of the Kozai\ncycles. The smaller Hill radii would allow more captured\nsatellites to escape, while on the other hand, the faster\nKozai cycles would decrease the decay timescale. Thus,\nif this model works fast enough for a static case, it should\nalso be applicable to a slowly migrating planet.\n\n2. KCTF MODEL\n\n3. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS\n\nIn order to understand how exomoon orbits may evolve\nafter being captured, we created a numerical Kozai Cycle and Tidal Friction (KCTF) model. Kozai cycles in\nthis context are the secular oscillations in eccentricity\nand inclination of the exomoon's orbit caused by stellar\ntorques (Kozai 1962). In isolation, these oscillations preserve the semimajor\naxis of the orbit and the quantity\n\u221a\nHk = cos(I) \u00d7 1 \u2212 e2 , where I is the inclination of the\nexomoon's orbit relative to the planet's stellarcentric orbit, and e is the eccentricity of the exomoon's orbit. In\nthe scenarios simulated, these cycles can initially be as\nfast as just a few years (see Figure 1), causing very rapid\nevolution of the exomoon's orbit. Since all the initial orbits for this study were highly elliptical, only very low\ninitial inclinations (within about 15\u25e6 of coplanar) produced values of Hk sufficiently low that Kozai cycles did\nnot occur.\nBecause the Kozai oscillations from the star attempt\nto preserve Hk , a drop in the inclination of the orbit\ncan cause the eccentricity to become very high. As the\neccentricity of the orbit increases, the periapse of the exomoon's orbit becomes much closer to the planet. Tidal\nforces become much stronger at these close distances (going as a\u22128 in this model), and so a close periapse due\nto eccentricity causes the orbit to shrink and thus decay\nfurther. This sets up a positive feedback loop, which progressively shrinks and circularizes the orbit. The stairstep semimajor axis decay in Figure 1 happens because\nthe obit is initially only decaying at high eccentricities;\nonce the apoapse is close enough to also experience tidal\nforces, the oscillations stop. The result is to cause semimajor axis decay and circularization much faster than\nif the star were not exciting eccentricity. In addition,\nsince the high eccentricity part of the Kozai cycles are at\nlow inclinations, orbits are preferentially frozen near the\nplane of the stellarcentric orbit.\nTo simulate this process, we used a KCTF model\nbased on that of Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton (2001),\nwhich allows the direct integration of the exomoon orbit's specific angular momentum vector h and LaplaceRunge-Lenz eccentricity vector e, as well as the spin vectors of the planet and satellite. The tidal properties\nof the giant planets were based on those presented in\n\nTo find in what conditions a captured exomoon may\nsurvive, we generated 18 sets of synthetic Star-PlanetMoon systems and performed KCTF simulations on\nthem. Each set contained 1000 synthetic systems, with\ncommon masses for all objects, and randomized initial\nexomoon orbits and spin states. To simulate a loose capture, the initial exomoon orbits all had apoapses beyond\n80% of the planet's Hill radius, and eccentricities greater\nthan 0.85. This is most consistent with a low mass ratio\nmomentum-exchange capture (Funato et al. 2004), but\ngenerally similar to any low delta-v, non-disruptive capture (or eccentricity excitation due to a close encounter).\nAgain consistent with a capture, both the satellite's initial orbital plane and spin vector were initially pointed\nat random directions on the sky. This means an approximate equipartition between prograde and retrograde initial orbits and between prograde and retrograde initial\nspin states for the satellite. The planets had a random\nobliquity less than 5\u25e6 from their stellarcentric orbit. Each\nplanet-moon system was at a stellarcentric distance such\nthat the equilibrium temperature was equal to Earth.\nThe stars and stellarcentric orbits used were the Sun\n(G2) at 1.0 AU, a main-sequence F0 (1.7 MSun ) at 2.1\nAU, and a main-sequence M0 (0.47 MSun ) at 0.28 AU.\nThe planets we assumed to have a mass equal to either\nJupiter or Neptune, using the tidal parameters given in\nFabrycky & Tremaine (2007), though nearly all dissipation was in the exomoon. The simulated exomoons had\nthe mass of either Earth, Mars, or Titan (with Mars uncompressed density), using a tidal Q of 100, modulus of\nrigidity of 3 \u00d7 1010 N/m2 (Gladman et al. 1996), and J2\nof 0.001. The initial rotational periods of the planet and\nsatellite were varied randomly between 0.1 and 48 hours.\nThe simulations were run until they reached either 109\nyears or an eccentricity below 10\u22125 . However, the simulations were terminated early if the periapse went below\nthe Roche limit (thus potentially causing breakup of the\nexomoon) or the apoapse exceeded the Hill radius (allowing the exomoon to become unbound). It is possible that\nthe exomoon could have survived and remained bound to\nthe planet in these scenarios, but that is beyond the fidelity of these simulations.\nTo estimate the detectability of the resulting systems,\n\n\f3\n!\"#\n\n$ %&\n\n\"\n\n!\"#\n\n$ %&\n\n\"\n\n' (\"\n\n! \"#\n\n$ %&\n\n!\"#\n\n$\n\n#\n\n%&\n\n' (#\n\n\"\n\n'\n\n(\n'\n)\n\nFig. 2.- Post-evolution orbital period and inclination distribution; most orbits are coplanar with the planet's orbit, with no\npro/retrograde preference.\n\n$ %\n\n& '(\n\n$ %\n\n& '(\n\n\" ) *\n\n!\n\n$ %\n\n& '(\n\n\" ) *\n\n\" \" #\n\"\n\n!\n$ %\n\n&\n\n'(\n\n\" \" #\n\"\n\n)\n\n*\n)\n\n!\n\n\" \" #\n\n!\n\n\" \" #\n\nFig. 3.- Post-capture circularization timescales; note that nearly\nall are below a few million years, and timescales decrease with\nstellar mass.\n\nwe calculated root-mean-squared Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) and Duration Variations (TDVs) for each\nsimulation. The TTV and TDV are due to the orbit of\nthe exomoon causing the exoplanet to begin the transit\neither sooner or later than the barycenter of the planetmoon system. These effects are maximized for low mass\nratios (e.g. Earth mass exomoon around a Neptunemass planet) and longer period exomoon orbits. Since\nthe majority of resulting systems were low-inclination\nwith respect to the stellarcentric orbit, we used the zeroinclination equations from Kipping (2009). Assuming\nzero-inclination maximizes the TTV and TDV, allowing\nan estimate of whether the system would be even detectable in the best case scenario.\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe general result of the simulations is that looselycaptured exomoons around giant planets in habitable\nzones can survive to stabilize into long-lived orbits. Table\n1 shows the fraction that stabilize for each mass/distance\nscenario. The exomoons stabilized much easier in the\nF0 case than the M0 case, with the solar-mass case inbetween. The reason for this is readily apparent from the\nobservation that while Hill radius scales linearly with distance from the star, the equilibrium temperature scales\nas the inverse square of distance. Thus, the super-solar\nmass star allows a much wider Hill radius at a habitable\ndistance than for a planet of equal mass around a subsolar mass star. This larger Hill radius provides the postcapture orbit much more room to move around, allowing\nlonger period exomoons to stabilize. The truncation of\nperiods greater than two days for the M0 case in Figure\n3 is a clear result of this.\nHowever, it also apparent from Figure 3 that the fast\nstellarcentric orbits of the M0 case allow for much more\nrapid exomoon circularization that for the larger stars.\nThis clearly shows the effect of Kozai-pumped eccentricities accelerating tidal decay, as otherwise the timescales\nwould be independent of the distance from the star. The\nmedian circularization timescales for the M0 cases are of\norder 104 years, 105 years for the solar-mass star, and\n106 years for the F0 star. All of these timescales are very\nshort relative to the lifetime of the star, but 106 years\nmay be long enough that the exomoon's orbit could be\nexternally perturbed by a planet or planetesimal disk.\nOn the other hand, as Figure 1 shows, the semimajor\naxis decay typically happens at least an order of magnitude faster than full circularization. Therefore, it is a\nreasonable assumption that nearly all these orbits would\nstabilize before any external perturbation would disrupt\nthem.\nTo gauge the amount of tidal heating on the satellite, we estimated the amount of energy lost from the\nsystem from the difference in the initial and final orbits\nand spins. For the orbits, we first found the energy difference between the initial and final states. Then, we\nmuliplied this an estimate of the fraction of energy that\nwent into the satellite using the masses and tidal Q of\nthe objects, Qplanet Msat /(Qplanet Msat + Qsat Mplanet ).\nThis term was usually near unity, as the planet was assumed to have a very large Q. We then estimated the\nchange in rotational energy of the satellite, subtracted\nthis from the change in orbital energy, and divided the\nresult by the circularization time to produce a heating\nrate. The rate was dominated by the orbital term, as\nthe initial rotation periods were not too different from\nthe final orbital periods. Generally, this rate was higher\nper unit mass for larger satellites (which circularized\nfaster) and closer orbits. For the Earth-mass/Jupitermass case, the median rates were 0.002 mW/kg around\na F0 star, 0.02 mW/kg around a solar-mass star, and 0.5\nmW/kg around a M0 star.

The M0 cases, on the other hand, actually impacted the planet in three-quarters of the cases,\ndue to the very small Hill radius not allowing the periapse to shrink very far before impacting. A majority\nof F0 cases survived in all scenarios, with the large Hill\nradius allowing most orbits to circularize. Therefore, for\na given capture rate, potentially habitable captured exomoons should be the most common around stars larger\nthan a solar mass.\nFigure 2 shows that the majority of the resulting orbits, especially around a Jupiter-mass planet, are nearly\ncoplanar with the stellarcentric orbit. This is partially\ndue to the assumed low obliquity of the planet aligning its gravitational quadrapole with the direction of\nthe star. However, as shown by the high inclination of\nTriton (5.9 day period), an orbit does not need to be\nvery large for this effect to be minimized. And indeed,\nthe orbits around Neptune-mass planets show a much\n\nlarger diversity of inclinations for periods less than two\ndays, especially for Earth-mass satellites. Beyond this\npoint, solar torques begin to dominate and force nearly\nall orbits coplanar. Since longer period orbits produce\nlarger TTVs, it is therefore likely that the first exomoons\ndetected will be coplanar with the stellarcentric orbit,\nand it will take much more observations to detect shortperiod, high-inclination exomoons.\nAlso congruent with Triton, Figure 2 shows that there\nis no real preference for either prograde or retrograde\norbits. The secular perturbations of Kozai cycles do\nnot allow the directionality of the orbit to change in\nall but the most inclined initial cases. Thus, each orbit preserves its original direction, evolving towards the\nplane of the stellarcentric orbit. All of the final orbits\nare circular and have semimajor axes less than 28% of\nthe planet-moon system's Hill radius, which as summarized by Donnison (2010), means that they should be stable over the lifetime of the star. Unfortunately, Kipping\n(2009) shows that TTV and TDV are both degenerate\n\n\f5\nfor prograde/retrograde inclinations, and so measuring\nthe relative fractions may be very difficult. However,\nSimon et al. (2010) show that it may be possible to break\nthis degeneracy with very precise measurements of the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect. Since secular perturbations\ncannot reverse the direction of a satellite's orbit, detection of a retrograde satellite around an exoplanet would\nbe confirmation that this capture process occurred.\nThe median TTV and TDV for each simulation set\nare given in Table 1. The TTV do vary over a large\nrange, but the upper end of that range is just within\nthe limits of detection for modern transit systems. The\nKepler mission has a regular cadence of approximately\nevery 30 minutes, and can run at a cadence of up to once\nper minute (Koch et al. 2010). This appears sufficient to\ndetect an Earth-mass exomoon in most cases, and just\nenough to detect a Mars-mass exomoon in the best cases.\nLarger stars offer wider orbits (and thus stronger TTVs),\nbut much more infrequent transits. Solar mass to early\nK stars therefore seem to offer a good balance between\nTTV strength and transit frequency.\nThe Transit Duration Variation (TDV) introduced by\nKipping (2009) allows the unambiguous detection of an\nexomoon from transits alone. For the systems described\nin that work, the TDV was of similar duration to the\nTTV. However, we find that the lower planetary masses\nand much wider stellarcentric orbits of our study result\nin relatively weak TDVs for nearly all cases. Thus, it\nis unlikely that a potentially habitable exomoon will be\ndetected by TDV alone; TDV could, though, allow for\nfollow-up transit observations to confirm the existence of\na TTV-detected exomoon.\nThese results compare well with previous estimates,\nthough both of those simulations assumed much wider\norbits than were usually produced by the KCTF model.\nThe consequence of this is both reduce the TDV sig-\n\nnal relative to that assumed by Kipping (2009) and the\nphotometric signal of Szab\u00f3 et al. (2006). On the other\nhand, Table 1 shows that even with these closer orbits,\nsome exomoons are still within the range of detectability.\nThe combination of TTV and TDV may offer a stronger\ndetection signal than photometry for these orbits, though\nboth could detect some of the orbits produced.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nSeveral general conclusions can therefore be drawn\nfrom our simulations:\n1. Loosely-captured exomoons around giant planets\nin habitable zones can survive to stabilize into longlived orbits.\n2. The timescale for them to stabilize is enhanced by\nKozai torques, and is generally less than a few million years.\n3. Most of the surviving orbits are close to the\nplane of the exoplanet's orbit, but show no prograde/retrograde preference.\n4. Some of the resulting orbits should be currently detectable (especially for Earth-mass satellites), with\nthe transit timing variation much stronger than the\nduration variation.\n5. The most promising targets for detecting potentially habitable exomoons by TTV appear to be\nNeptune-mass exoplanets orbiting stars of solar\nmass or slightly below.\n\nSpecial thanks to Travis Barman for donating the approximately 5000 CPU hours it took to complete this\nproject.\n\nREFERENCES\nAgnor, C.
