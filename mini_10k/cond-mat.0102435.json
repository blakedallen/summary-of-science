In these materials, the elementary magnetic unit is the triangle, which makes it impossible to satisfy all the antiferromagnetic\nbonds at the same time, with the result of a macroscopically degenerate ground state. Examples\nof GFAF are the pyrochlore and the kagom\u00e9 lattices. In the former, the magnetic ions occupy the\ncorners of a 3D arrangement of corner sharing tetrahedra; in the later, the magnetic ions occupy\nthe corners of a 2D arrangement of corner sharing triangles (see Fig. 1). In the case of materials\nwhich crystallize in the pyrochlore structure, the static magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie\u2013\nWeiss law down to temperatures well below the Curie\u2013Weiss temperature. At this point, usually\none to two orders of magnitude smaller than the Ne\u00e9l point predicted by the standard mean field\n(MF) theory, some systems exhibit some kind of long range order (LRO), whereas others show a\ntransition to a spin glass state (SG). This is a striking feature for a system with only a marginal\n\n\f2\namount of disorder. Finally, there are some pyrochlores which do not exhibit any form of order\nwhatsoever, and are usually regarded as spin liquids. In the case of the kagom\u00e9 lattice, even though\nthere are very few real systems where this structure is realized, the magnetic properties fall in two\nmajor categories: the vast majority of the compounds studied show a transition to a LRO state with\na non collinear configuration of spins, and a few systems exhibit no LRO, but a SG like transition.\nSurprisingly, Harris and coworkers5,6,7 recently showed that geometrical frustration can also\narise from ferromagnetic interactions. This cannot occur for Heisenberg spins but, in some cases,\na strong single ion anisotropy along high symmetry directions of the crystallographic structure can\nforce the spins to point in such directions, so they can effectively be considered as Ising spins8 .\nIn this case, the Ising spins with ferromagnetic interactions do not order at any finite temperature.\nThey analyzed this problem in the context of Ising spins in the corners of a pyrochlore lattice,\nand termed this system spin ice pyrochlore, because it can be mapped to the well know proton\nordering problem in the ice lattice. Furthermore, in full equivalence with the ice problem, the spin\nice model presents a slow dynamic, due to the existence of large energy barriers associated with\nrearrangements of the spins in the ground state, resulting in a spin freezing which resembles a spin\nglass, but occurring in a system where chemical disorder is absent5,9 .\nWhile at first sight this can look like a very interesting academic problem, it turned out to be\nalso of enormous practical interest, because various pyrochlore oxides were found to have strong\nsingle ion anisotropy along the h1 1 1i-directions of the lattice. This effect usually occurs for rare\nearth magnetic ions with a large orbital moment, as it is the case of the pyrochlores Ho2 Ti2O7 ,\nDy2 Ti2 O7 , and Yb2 Ti2 O7 , among others, which are now known to be very good realizations of the\nspin ice model.\nFrom the theoretical point of view, apart from the interest of the spin ice system itself, this\nsystem also offers a unique opportunity for testing models which incorporate geometrical frustration, for the obvious reason that the Ising Hamiltonian is simpler to study mathematically than\nthe Heisenberg one and, in some cases, analytical results are easily obtained, which can be readily compared with experimental data or simulations. If such a comparison is adequate, one can\nget some confidence that these techniques can also be applied to the Heisenberg problem in the\npyrochlore lattice, which is an even more interesting problem.\nThis is precisely the purpose of the present work. We will study the critical properties of\ngeometrically frustrated Ising ferro- and antiferromagnets by introducing a generalization of a well\nknown real space renormalization group technique, the so called Effective Field Renormalization\nGroup (EFRG) method10,11 , which has been successfully applied to a large variety of systems (see\nRef. 12 and references therein), and it is known to provide very good estimates of the critical\ntemperature and the critical exponents. We apply this technique to two model systems: the spin\nice problem in the pyrochlore lattice, and a 2D analog to the spin ice problem, which consists of\nIsing spins in the kagom\u00e9 lattice with local axes of anisotropy along the heights of the triangle.\nThis second example, though academic, is a very instructive one, as it will serve as an example to\ndevelop the present method. Our first task will be to generalize the EFRG technique to include the\neffect of geometrical frustration, that is, the non-Bravais character of the lattices considered. We\nwill then study the existence of critical points and their values for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic\ninteractions. The obtained values are compared with exact values known for the Ising model in the\nkagom\u00e9 lattice13 and with numerical estimations of this quantity obtained by Harris and Bramwell\nfor the spin ice pyrochlore7 . We find that, even at the lowest order of approximation, in which\ncorrelations with ions further that NN are neglected, the estimates are excellent for both lattices.\nFurthermore, we show that these spin ice-like Ising models can be related to the standard Ising\nmodel31 . Therefore, we are able to understand why the ground state given by the ice rules is never\n\n\f3\n\nnC\n\nnB\n\nnC\n\nnB\n\nnD\n\nnA\n(a) Kagom\u00e9 lattice.\n\nnA\n\n(b) Pyrochlore lattice.\n\nFIG. 1: The structures considered in this work. The black thick lines indicate the axes of anisotropy. Spin\nlabels are of the form i\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the label of the sublattice and i the index of the spin inside the\ncorresponding sublattice. The normal vectors n\nb\u03b1 have been also depicted.\n\nfound in these systems, in agreement with numerical evidences provided by other authors7,9 . Next,\nwe evaluate the thermal and magnetic exponents for the transition to an ordered state that is found\nfor antiferromagnetic spin ice, namely, a ground state in which all the spins point out or all the spins\npoint in. These exponents are calculated for two limiting cases: the one corresponding to Ising\nspins with a single anisotropy axis, that is, the standard Ising model, and the one corresponding to\nthe spin problem. For the standard Ising model the calculated exponents are found to be in good\nagreement when compared with exact values for 2D lattices, and with Monte Carlo simulations\nfor the 3D lattice, for the Ising universality class. For the spin ice case, the thermal exponent is\nthe same as in the standard Ising model, whereas the magnetic one is found to be different for\nboth lattices, in agreement with the fact that the Zeeman term in this case does not have the same\nsymmetry as in the standard Ising model.\nAdditionally, we find interesting to compare the results obtained from this new method with\nthe ones predicted by the Generalized Constant Coupling (GCC) model, recently developed by\nthe present authors14,15 , which has been shown to provide very accurate results for the magnetic\nproperties of Heisenberg GFAF. The results for the critical points and ground state configurations\nobtained in the GCC framework are found to be in excellent agreement with the ones found by using the EFRG technique, in spite of the mathematical simplicity of the GCC method. Incidentally,\nwe show that this agreement is not a coincidence, but it is related to the fact that the GCC method\ncan be considered as the zero-th order approximation of the EFRG scheme.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we introduce the systems we will deal with and a brief summary of the EFRG method, together with the corresponding\ngeneralization to deal with geometrically frustrated lattices. In the third section we develop the\nEFRG scheme for both the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattice with anisotropic Ising interactions. In\nsection IV, the finite scaling hypothesis is used to calculate the non-trivial fixed points of the RG\n\n\f4\ntransformation (the critical points), together with the possible ground state configurations of the\nsystem. In section V we calculate the thermal and magnetic critical exponents for the long range\nordered state found in the previous section for antiferromagnetic interactions. In section VI, we\napply the GCC model to the present problem and, again, the critical points and ground state configurations are calculated and compared with the EFRG method. In section VII, the connection\nbetween both schemes is furnished. Finally, section VIII is devoted to the conclusions.\nII.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nIn the systems we will consider below, the strong single-ion anisotropy forces the spins in the\nlattice to point in high symmetry directions and, to a first approximation, they can be regarded as\nIsing spins8. For example, in the spin ice pyrochlore, each ion in the elementary tetrahedral unit\npoints in a different h111i-type direction, which connects the spin with the center of the tetrahedra.\nTherefore, the spin variables are not scalar ones, but have vectorial character. We will represent\neach of the spins by a vector ~si\u03b1 = si\u03b1 n\nb\u03b1 , where si\u03b1 takes the values \u00b11 and n\nb\u03b1 stands for the\nunitary vector in one of the directions of anisotropy, where \u03b1 takes the values \u03b1 = A, B, C, . . .,\ndepending on the number of different directions of anisotropy (see Fig. 1). The index i runs over\nall the spins with a given normal vector.\nThe Ising Hamiltonian with only NN interactions in adimensional units can be then put as\nXX\nH=K\n~si\u03b1 * ~sj\u03b2 ,\n(1)\n\u03b16=\u03b2 hi,ji\n\nwhere K = \u03b2J is the adimensional coupling constant, which is positive for ferromagnetic interactions and negative for antiferromagnetic interactions. We can see that, in this way, we have defined\na finite number of sublattices, characterized by the corresponding orientation of the Ising spins,\nwhich has the advantage that a spin in sublattice \u03b1 interacts only with spins in different sublattices.\nThe geometries we will consider in this work are those depicted in Fig. 1: anisotropic Ising\nspins in the kagom\u00e9 lattice, which can be considered as a 2D analog to the spin ice problem, and\nthe spin ice problem, that is, anisotropic Ising spins in a pyrochlore lattice.\nIn order to study the critical properties of these systems, we will make use of the so called\nEFRG technique, which has been proved to be a very good RG scheme for dealing with critical\nphenomena. We will not present the method here, as there is an excellent review on this subject12 ,\nbut only the most important notions.\nAccording to the idea of scaling16 , close to the transition the singular part of the free energy\nscales as\nfs (\u01eb, H) = l\u2212d fs (l1/\u03bd \u01eb, lyH H),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u01eb = K \u2212 Kc , with Kc the critical coupling, l is an arbitrary scaling factor, d is the dimensionality of the lattice, yH is the magnetic critical exponent and H the applied magnetic field,\nand \u03bd is the correlation length critical exponent. Any other thermodynamic quantity, P , can be\nevaluated as derivatives of this singular part of the free energy near the transition, and will behave\nas a power law\nP \u223c |\u01eb|\u2212\u03c3 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\f5\nwhere \u03c3 is the critical exponent of the quantity P . For example, the magnetization, near criticality,\nbehaves as\nm(\u01eb, H) = l\u2212d+yH m(l1/\u03bd \u01eb, lyH H).\n\n(4)\n\nOn the other hand, according to the finite size scaling hypothesis, the generalized scaling relation obeyed by any thermodynamic quantity P , taking into account the finite size L of the system,\ncan be put as16\nP (\u01eb, H, L) = l\u03c6 P (l1/\u03bd \u01eb, lyH H, l\u22121 L),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c6 = \u03c3/\u03bd is the anomalous dimension of the quantity P . By choosing a smaller system of\nsize L\u2032 , fixing the scaling factor to the value l = LL\u2032 , and introducing the variables \u01eb\u2032 = l1/\u03bd \u01eb =\nK \u2032 \u2212 Kc and H \u2032 = lyH H, we can rewrite relation (5) in the form\nPL\u2032 (K \u2032 , H \u2032 )\nPL (K, H)\n=\n.\n\u03c6\nL\u03c6\nL\u2032\n\n(6)\n\nThis is the basic equation from where a mapping (K, H) \u2192 (K \u2032 , H \u2032) can be established, and the\ncorresponding critical points and exponents obtained.\nBy applying relation (6) to different thermodynamic quantities, different RG approaches are\ngenerated. For example, on applying (6) to the correlation length, we have\n\u03be \u2032 (K \u2032 , H \u2032 )\n\u03be(K, H)\n=\n,\n\u2032\nL\nL\n\n(7)\n\nwhich means that, for the correlation length, the anomalous dimension is the unity.\nThe EFRG approach corresponds to apply relation (6) to the order parameter (magnetization).\nThe order parameter for two clusters of different size is calculated by using the Callen\u2013Suzuki\nidentity17,18\n\nhOp i =\n\n\u001c\n\nT rp Op eHp\nT rp eHp\n\n\u001d\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nH\n\nwhere the partial trace is taken over the set of p spin variables specified by the finite size cluster\nHamiltonian Hp ; Op is the corresponding order parameter, and h. . . iH indicates the usual canonical\nthermal average over the ensemble defined by the complete Hamiltonian H. The idea is then to\nreplace the effect of the total Hamiltonian not included in the partial trace in (8) by fixed values\nof the magnetization of the ions outside the cluster, which act as a symmetry breaking field, b. In\nthis way, the order parameter in the finite cluster can be computed for b \u226a 1 and H \u226a 1, and an\nequation of the form\nmp (K, b, H) = hOp i = fp (K) b + gp (K) H,\n\n(9)\n\nis obtained. Repeating the same calculation for a cluster of different size, p\u2032 , and assuming that\nboth magnetizations are related by the scaling relation (4) near criticality, we obtain the following\nequation\nfp\u2032 (K \u2032 ) b\u2032 + gp\u2032 (K \u2032 ) H \u2032 = ld\u2212yH fp (K) b + ld\u2212yH gp (K) H.\n\n(10)\n\n\f6\n\n(a) 1-spin cluster.\n\n(b) 3-spins cluster.\n\nFIG. 2: Clusters used in this work for the kagom\u00e9 lattice. Dark spheres represent spins belonging to the\ncluster itself and white spheres the corresponding surrounding sites (those creating an effective field).\n\nAs b and b\u2032 are, in some sense, magnetizations, they are also assumed to satisfy (4), so we have the\nfollowing relation\nfp\u2032 (K \u2032 ) = fp (K),\n\n(11)\n\nfrom which the fixed points of this RG transformation and, thus the critical points, are found by\nsolving this equation for K \u2032 = K = Kc .

However, it has\nbeen found that these kinds of approaches are applicable to rather small systems and, sometimes,\nthey are even more accurate than other RG approaches, for clusters of adequate size12 .\nEven though the EFRG scheme has been successfully applied to a broad range of problems,\nthe original formulation of this method is not well suited to deal with the effects of geometrical\n\n\f7\n\n(a) 1-spin cluster.\n\n(b) 4-spins cluster.\n\nFIG. 3: Clusters used in this work for the pyrochlore lattice. Dark spheres represent spins belonging to the\ncluster itself and white spheres the corresponding surrounding sites (those creating an effective field).\n\nfrustration, that is, magnetic systems with a non\u2013Bravais lattice, as those considered in this work.\nTherefore, our first task, is to generalize this technique to include this class of systems. In order to\naccomplish this goal, we must face two problems: on one hand, due to the non\u2013Bravais character\nof the lattices, we cannot characterize the full system with only one order parameter; on the other\nhand, the finite clusters considered have to have a minimum size such that all the order parameters\nvariables are included in the reduced trace, at least for one of the clusters, which involves a more\ncomplicated mathematical problem. These difficulties, of course, are not a particular flaw of the\nEFRG scheme, as they are present in all the real space RG schemes, and are related to the fact that\nnon-Bravais lattices are non-invariant under a scale transformation. To cite an example, under a\nblock transformation, the kagom\u00e9 lattice does not transform in itself, but in a triangular lattice.\nThe easiest way of solving these technical difficulties is by subdividing the non-Bravais lattice\nin a number of Bravais lattices, and allowing for a different order parameter in each sublattice. For\nexample, in the case of the kagom\u00e9 lattice, it can be considered as formed by n = 3 interlocked\ntriangular lattices (\u03b1 = A, B, C), whereas in the pyrochlore case, it can considered as formed by\nn = 4 interlocked FCC lattices (\u03b1 = A, B, C, D).\nNext, we have to decide the size of the two finite clusters we are considering. The most obvious\nchoice is to consider a cluster formed by one single spin and another one formed by p = 3 spins\nfor the kagom\u00e9 lattice (see Fig. 2) and p = 4 spins for the pyrochlore lattice (see Fig. 3).\nThe following step is to evaluate the expectation value of each of the order parameters for these\nclusters by using the Callen\u2013Suzuki identity, a task that we carry out in the next section.\nIII.\n\nEVALUATION OF THE ORDER PARAMETERS\nA. 1-spin cluster order parameter\n\nLet us consider the cluster defined by the ion 1 in sublattice \u03b1. The Hamiltonian of this cluster\nis given by\n\u2032\n\nH1\u03b1 = K ~s1\u03b1\n\nz\nXX\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\ni\n\n~si\u03b2 = ~s1\u03b1 * \u03be~1\u03b1 ,\n\n(16)\n\n\f8\nwhere the subindex 1\u03b1 makes reference to the fact that the Hamiltonian corresponds to a cluster\nof 1 spin belonging to sublattice \u03b1, and \u03be~1\u03b1 stands for the symmetry breaking field acting on the\nspin of the 1-spin cluster, which belong to sublattice \u03b1. The sum over the i index is performed\nover the NN of the 1\u03b1 spin, with z the number of NN in each of the sublattices (z = 2 for both the\nkagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices). By using the Callen\u2013Suzuki identity we can calculate the order\nparameter in sublattice \u03b1 for a cluster formed by 1 spin\n\u001c\n\u001d\nT r1\u03b1~s1\u03b1 eH1\u03b1\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 = h~s1\u03b1 i =\n.\n(17)\nT r1\u03b1 eH1\u03b1\nH\nAs commented above, T r1\u03b1 represents the partial trace with respect to the variables of the spin\n1\u03b1, and the symbol h. . . iH stands for the usual canonical thermal average taken over the ensemble\ndefined by the complete Hamiltonian H.

The expression\n\u2032\nof K takes into account the fact that, for the structures considered in this work, the angle between\nthe directions of anisotropy is the same for any pair of neighboring spins.\nThen, the order parameter for the 1-spin cluster can be put in the form\n*\n+\nz\nYY\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 = n\nb\u03b1\n[\u03c1x + si\u03b2 \u03bdx ]\ntanh x|x=0 .\n(24)\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\ni\n\nH\n\n\f9\nFor example, for the kagom\u00e9 lattice, the previous expression takes the form\n\u0001\n\u0002\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 = n\nb\u03b1 2\u03c13x \u03bdx hs1\u03b2 iH + hs1\u03b3 iH\n\n\u0001\n+\u03c12x \u03bdx2 hs1\u03b2 s2\u03b2 iH + hs1\u03b3 s2\u03b3 iH + 2 hs1\u03b2 s1\u03b3 iH + 2 hs1\u03b2 s2\u03b3 iH\n\u0001\n\u0003\n+2\u03c1x \u03bdx3 hs1\u03b2 s1\u03b3 s2\u03b3 iH + hs1\u03b2 s1\u03b3 s2\u03b2 iH + \u03bdx4 hs1\u03b2 s1\u03b3 s2\u03b2 s2\u03b3 iH tanh x|x=0 ,\n\n(\u03b1 6= \u03b2 6= \u03b3). (25)\n\nThese kind of equations, though exact, are intractable, and we have to resort to some kind of\napproximation. The simplest one corresponds to neglect 2-spin and higher order correlations19 ,\nthat is\nhsi\u03b1 sj\u03b2 . . . sk\u03b3 iH \u2243 hsi\u03b1 iH hsj\u03b2 iH . . . hsk\u03b3 iH ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhich is equivalent to neglect terms of the order of Kc2 and higher in the calculation of the critical\npoints. It must be noted, however, that this approximation is superior to the standard MF theory,\nsince it takes exactly into account the relation s2i\u03b2 = 1 (i 6= 1), through the van der Waerden\nidentity.\nApplying (26) to (24), and to first order in hsi\u03b1 iH = b1\u03b1 (which constitutes a good approximation near the critical point), where the subindex 1 means that these symmetry breaking fields\nhave been obtained from the 1-spin cluster, we arrive to the final form of the order parameter in\nsublattice \u03b1\nX\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 = n\nb\u03b1 A(K\u2032 )\nb1\u03b2 ,\n(27)\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhere\n\n\u03bdx tanh x|x=0 ,\nA(K\u2032 ) = z \u03c1z(p\u22121)\u22121\nx\n\n(28)\n\nwhich, after a straightforward calculation it is found to be\nA(K\u2032 ) =\n\n2 tanh(2K\u2032 ) + tanh(4K\u2032 )\n,\n4\n\n(29)\n\nfor the kagom\u00e9 lattice (z = 2 and p = 3), and\nA(K\u2032 ) =\n\n5 tanh(2K\u2032 ) + 4 tanh(4K\u2032 ) + tanh(6K\u2032 )\n,\n16\n\n(30)\n\nfor the pyrochlore lattice (z = 2 and p = 4).\nB.\n\np-spin cluster order parameter\n\nLet us consider now a cluster formed by p spins, each of one belonging to a different sublattice\n(therefore, we will have p = 3 for the kagom\u00e9 lattice and p = 4 for the pyrochlore lattice). The\nHamiltonian of such a cluster can be put as\nX\nX\nHp = K\n~s1\u03b1 * ~s1\u03b2 +\n~s1\u03b1 * \u03be~p\u03b1.\n(31)\n\u03b16=\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\f10\nIn this Hamiltonian, the first term represents the interaction between the spins inside the cluster of\nsize p, whereas the second term represents the interaction of those same spins with the symmetry\nbreaking fields\n\u03be~p\u03b1 = K\n\nz\u22121\nXX\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\n~si\u03b2 ,\n\n(32)\n\ni\n\ncreated by the rest of spins outside the cluster. The sum over i goes over all the NN spins except\nthe ones already included in the cluster. The order parameter for each of the sublattices included\nin the cluster, obtained from the p-spin cluster can be now put as\n\u001c\n\u001d\nT r1A,1B,1C...~s1\u03b1 eHp\nm\n~ p\u03b1 =\n,\n(33)\nT r1A,1B,1C... eHp\nH\nor, more conveniently\nm\u03bcp\u03b1\n\n=\n\n\u001c\n\n\u2202\nHp\n\u03bc ln T r1A,1B,1C... e\n\u2202\u03bep\u03b1\n\n\u001d\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\nH\n\nIn these expressions, T r1A,1B,1C... represents the trace over the spin degrees of freedom in the\np-spin cluster.\nEven though the discussion can be continued for a cluster with an arbitrary number of spins, the\nmathematical details get very cumbersome. Therefore, we will carry on separately the calculation\nof the order parameter for the kagom\u00e9 and the pyrochlore lattices.\n1.\n\nKagom\u00e9 lattice\n\nIn the case of the kagom\u00e9 lattice, we will consider a triangular cluster defined by p = 3 spins.\nIn doing so, we can easily calculate the reduced partition function appearing in (34)\nT r1A,1B,1C eHp = Z3 (K, \u03a0A , \u03a0B , \u03a0C ) = cosh(\u03a0A + \u03a0B + \u03a0C )\n+ e\u22124K [cosh(\u03a0A \u2212 \u03a0B + \u03a0C ) + cosh(\u03a0A + \u03a0B \u2212 \u03a0C ) + cosh(\u03a0A \u2212 \u03a0B \u2212 \u03a0C )] , (35)\nwhere \u03a0\u03b1 = n\nb\u03b1 * \u03be~3\u03b1 and K = K cosh \u03b8.

For that reason, we have preferred not to quote them here, but\nillustrate their behavior by Fig. 4.\nIV.\n\nSCALING RELATIONS AND CRITICAL BEHAVIOR\n\nLet us summarize the results obtained so far. The order parameters of each sublattice for the\n1-spin cluster are related by the system of equations\nX\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 = A(K\u2032 )\nb1\u03b2 n\nb\u03b1 ,\n(51)\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhereas the order parameters of each sublattice for the p-spin cluster are related by the equations\n\"\n#\nX\nm\n~ p\u03b1 = \u03a6(K) bp\u03b1 + \u0398(K)\nbp\u03b2 n\nb\u03b1 ,\n(52)\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhere A(K\u2032 ), \u03a6(K), and \u0398(K), are given by expressions (29), (44), (45), and (30), (49), (50), for\nthe kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices, respectively.\nBy making use of the scaling hypothesis (6) for both the order parameter and the symmetry\nbreaking fields12 we arrive to a system of equations for the symmetry breaking fields\n\u03a6(K) bp\u03b1 + [\u0398(K) \u2212 A(K\u2032 )]\n\nX\n\nbp\u03b2 = 0,\n\n(53)\n\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03a6, \u0398, and A are to be replaced by the corresponding expressions, and \u03b1, \u03b2 = A, B, and C\nfor the kagom\u00e9 lattice and \u03b1, \u03b2 = A, B, C, and D for the pyrochlore lattice.

The \u03b8 = 0 case corresponds\nto the standard Ising model, whereas \u03b8 6= 0 corresponds to anisotropic Ising interactions (see text).\n\nwhich has two solutions that give us the corresponding RG recursion relations for the coupling\nconstants.\nThe first one corresponds to\n\u03a6(K) + (p \u2212 1)\u0398(K) = (p \u2212 1)A(K \u2032 ).\n\n(55)\n\nIn this case, the solution of the system of equations is given by (notice that we have omitted the\nindex corresponding to the size of the cluster)\nbA = bB = bC = . . .\n\n(56)\n\nor, in terms of the modulus of the order parameter,\nmA = mB = mC = . . . ,\n\n(57)\n\nand corresponds to a configuration in which all the spins point \"out\" or all the spins point \"in\", as\nhas been depicted in Fig. 5. We will term this configuration \"Type A\".\nThe second solution occurs if\n\u0398(K) \u2212 \u03a6(K) = A(K\u2032 ),\n\n(58)\n\nwhich leads to a configuration in which\nX\n\nb\u03b1 = 0,\n\n(59)\n\nX\n\nm\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(60)\n\n\u03b1\n\nor, in terms of the order parameters\n\n\u03b1\n\nWe will term this configuration as \"Type B\".\nIt is important to notice that through the introduction of the effective couplings K\u2032 and K,\nwe can consider both the standard Ising Hamiltonian in these geometries and the corresponding\n\n\f15\n\n\u03bf\n\n\u03b8=0\n\n\u03b8=0\n\no\n\n\u03b8 = 109.47\n\n\u03bf\n\no\n\n\u03b8 = 120\n\n(a) Kagom\u00e9 lattice.\n\n(b) Pyrochlore lattice.\n\nFIG. 6: Type B configuration for the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices at T = 0. The \u03b8 = 0 case corresponds\nto the standard antiferromagnetic Ising model, whereas \u03b8 6= 0 corresponds to anisotropic Ising interactions\n(see text).\n\nspin ice problem on equal footing or, equivalently, we can map the spin ice problem in these\ngeometries to the standard Ising model. Indeed, the standard Ising model corresponds to taking\ncos \u03b8 = n\nb\u03b1 *b\nn\u03b2 = 1, that is, the spins point along the same direction, whereas the case \u03b8 = 120\u25e6 for\nthe kagom\u00e9 lattice corresponds to the 2D spin ice analog commented above. The case \u03b8 = 109.47\u25e6\nis the spin ice problem in the pyrochlore lattice.\nIn the case \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 , the Type A configuration corresponds to ferromagnetic order, whereas the\nType B configuration is a generalization of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, in the pyrochlore\ncase, and for Ising spins pointing along h1, 1, 1i-type directions, the last configuration contains,\namong others more general, the ground state configuration of the spin ice system, in which two\nspins point \"in\" and two spins point \"out\" (see Fig. 6), and reflects the degeneracy of the ground\nstate due to the geometrical frustration. It is important to notice that it impossible to satisfy condition (60) in the kagom\u00e9 case at T = 0, which has been noted in Fig. 6 by a double spin in one of\nthe corners.\nOf course, apart from obtaining the possible spin configurations, it is even more important to\nstudy if they are thermally stable, that is, if they really occur. To this end, we have to see if there\nis any value K\u2032 = K = Kc that satisfies conditions (55) and (58), that is, if the RG recursion\nrelations defined by (55) and (58) have any non-trivial fixed points. The simplest way of solving\nthese equations is by using graphical methods, as has been done in Figs. 7 and 8 for the kagom\u00e9\nand pyrochlore lattices, respectively.\nFrom these figures, we can see that for the Type B configuration, the only fixed point of the RG\ntransformation is the trivial one, corresponding to a paramagnetic configuration (K = K\u2032 = 0).\nHowever, there is a non trivial fixed point for the Type A configuration (Kc = 0.415 for the kagom\u00e9\nlattice and Kc = 0.23 for the pyrochlore lattice), depending on the sign of the effective coupling\nor, in other words, depending on whether the effective coupling is ferro- or antiferromagnetic.\nThese results have been collected in Table I, for both the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices, and for\nboth the standard Ising model and the spin ice problem. Also, the exact results known for the\nkagom\u00e9 lattice13 and the ones obtained from MC data for the pyrochlore lattice7 are quoted for\ncomparison. It can be seen that the estimates obtained from this RG scheme are in very good\nagreement with the exact values, in spite of the crudeness of the decoupling approximation and\nthe fact that we have considered clusters of small size. This reflects the well known fact that, in\n\n\f16\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\nB1(x)/2+B2(x)\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\nA(x)\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n\nB2(x)-B1(x)\n\n-0.6\n\nA(x)\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.8\n-2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0\nx\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0\nx\n\n(a) Type A configuration.\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n(b) Type B configuration.\n\nFIG. 7: Graphical estimation of the fixed points of the RG transformation for the kagom\u00e9 lattice.

On\nthe other hand, correlations inside the unit are considered to some extent by the present technique.\nIn any case, the quality of the estimates can be systematically improved by considering larger\nunits as, in this way, we include further correlations. However, the improvement in the estimate\nof the critical point is not commensurate with the additional algebraic difficulty involved. Another\nimportant point is that the EFRG method distinguishes among the various different geometries for\na given number of NN, in contrast with standard MF approaches, which do not distinguish, for\nexample between a cubic lattice and a pyrochlore one32 .\nRegarding the question of geometrical frustration, which leads to the absence of a transition to\na long range ordered state at any finite temperature, both the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore ferromagnetic\nIsing lattices are non-frustrated, whereas the corresponding antiferromagnetic ones are frustrated,\nand remain paramagnetic down to 0 K. In the spin ice case (\u03b8 = 120\u25e6 for the kagom\u00e9 lattice\nand \u03b8 = 109.47\u25e6 for the pyrochlore), however, the ferromagnetic case is frustrated, and does not\norder at any finite temperature, whereas the antiferromagnetic one experiments a transition to a\n\n\f17\nKagom\u00e9\nPyrochlore\nK >0 K <0 K >0 K <0\nEFRG\n\u03b8=0\n0.415\n-\n0.230\n-\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u03b8 = 120 (109.47 ) - \u22120.830 - \u22120.690\nGCC\n\u03b8=0\n0.402\n-\n0.227\n-\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u03b8 = 120 (109.47 ) - \u22120.804 - \u22120.671\nTABLE II: Critical points obtained from the EFRG and GCC methods for the Ising, kagom\u00e9 spin ice, and\nspin ice pyrochlore.

In any case, the ground state given\nby the \"ice rule\"7,9 never occurs in these systems. Furthermore, we can see now that the reason\nwhy the ferromagnetic spin ice system is frustrated is that it can be mapped to the standard Ising\nHamiltonian with antiferromagnetic effective interaction, K < 0, which is known to be frustrated.\n\nV. CALCULATION OF THE CRITICAL EXPONENTS\n\nIn this section we will carry out the calculation of the critical exponents associated with the\ntransition to the Type A configuration, which, as found in the previous section, is the only one that\noccurs in these systems. As it is easy to see from the considerations in Section II, in order to obtain\nthese exponents, we will need to include the effect of a magnetic field applied to the system, which\nis what we do in the following.\n\n\f18\nWe can make use of the results of the previous sections to consider the inclusion of the applied\nmagnetic field, ~h = h n\nb, in the direction given by the normal vector n\nb, by redefining the conjugated\n~\nfields \u03bep\u03b1 as\nfor the p-spin cluster and\n\n\u03be~p\u03b1 \u2192 \u03be~p\u03b1 + (b\nn*n\nb\u03b1 ) h\n\n(61)\n\n\u03be~1\u03b1 \u2192 \u03be~1\u03b1 + (b\nn*n\nb\u03b1 ) h\u2032\n\n(62)\n\nh\u2032 = lyH h,\n\n(63)\n\nfor the 1-spin cluster. The magnetic fields for both clusters scale as\n\nwith yH the magnetic critical exponent16.\nNow, it is straightforward to see that the corresponding order parameter in each sublattice for\nthe 1-spin cluster is given by\nD\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011iE\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 = n\nb\u03b1 tanh n\nb\u03b1 * \u03be~1\u03b1 + n\nbh\n.\n(64)\nH\n\nFor small values of h, we can put\nh\niE\no\nnD\nh\niE D\n2\n2\n~\n~\nb\u03b1 * \u03be1\u03b1 (b\nn*n\nb\u03b1 ) h + O(h ) .\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 \u2243 n\nb\u03b1 tanh n\nb\u03b1 * \u03be1\u03b1 + sech n\n\n(65)\n\nBy making use of the exponential operator identity together with the van der Waerden identity,\nwe easily obtain, to the lowest order in the fields \u03be~ and ~h\n)\n(\nX\nb1\u03b2 + F (K\u2032 ) (b\nn*n\nb\u03b1 ) h n\nb\u03b1 ,\n(66)\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 \u2243 A(K\u2032 )\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhere A(K\u2032 ) is given by (28) and\n\nF (K\u2032 ) = \u03c1xz(p\u22121) sech2 (x)\n\nx=0\n\n.\n\n(67)\n\nFor the kagom\u00e9 lattice (z = 2 and p = 3)\n1\nF (K\u2032 ) = (3 + 4 sech2 2K\u2032 + sech2 4K\u2032 ).\n8\n\n(68)\n\nFor the pyrochlore lattice (z = 2 and p = 4)\nF (K) =\n\n1\n(10 + 15 sech2 2K + 6 sech2 4K + sech2 6K).\n32\n\n(69)\n\nLet us now turn our attention to the 3-spin cluster in the kagom\u00e9 case. We follow exactly the same\nprocedure we have used to arrive to eq. (66), but using the expression for the order parameter of\nthis cluster, eq. (37). Thus, we first expand m\n~ 3\u03b1 in powers of h and b3\u03b1 , after the substitution (61)\nhas been done, and make use of the differential operator and van der Waerden identities. In doing\nso, we arrive at\n~ \u03b1 (K) * ~h) + O(h2 ).\nm\n~ 3\u03b1 (b3A , b3B , b3C , ~h) \u2243 m\n~ 3\u03b1 (b3A , b3B , b3C ) + n\nb \u03b1 (G\n\n(70)\n\n\f19\nThe first term on the right member of this expression is the same as (41), whereas the second one\n~ \u03b1 (K) is given by\nis new, and the function G\n~ \u03b1 (K) = \u03c12 \u03c12 \u03c12 \u2202 g\u03b1 (x + n\n,\n(71)\nbA * ~h, y + n\nbB * ~h, z + n\nbC * ~h)\nG\nx y z\n~h=~0\n\u2202~h\n~ \u03b1 will depend on \u03b1 in\nwith g\u03b1 (x, y, z) given as in (39) and (40). For arbitrary n\nbA , n\nbB , and n\nbC , G\na complicated way. However, in this work, we are only concerned about the cases studied in the\nprevious Section, namely, the standard Ising model, n\nbA = n\nbB = n\nbC , and the 2D spin ice problem\non the kagom\u00e9 lattice, which verifies the property n\nbA + n\nbB + n\nbC = ~0. In these cases, it is easy to\nshow that\n~ \u03b1 (K) = G(K) n\nG\nb\u03b1 ,\n(72)\n\nwhere the form of the function G(K) does depend on whether n\nbA = n\nbB = n\nbC or n\nbA +b\nnB +b\nnC = ~0.\nIn the first case (standard Ising model), this function is given by\n\u0012\n1\n320\n704\n6144\n768\n24(\u22127 + 3e4K )\nGI (K) =\n138 \u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n+\n192\n(1 + e4K )2 1 + e4K (3 + e4K )2 3 + e4K (4 \u2212 e4K + e8K )2\n8(\u22126 + e4K )\n3(17 + 11e4K )\n3(1 + 80e4K )\n48(\u221213 \u2212 50e4K + 63e8K )\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n4 \u2212 e4K + e8K (1 + e4K + 2e8K )2 1 + e4K + 2e8K\n(1 + 5e4K + e8K + e12K )2\n\u0013\n48(\u221213 + 18e4K + e8K )\n+\n, (73)\n1 + 5e4K + e8K + e12K\nwhereas, in the second case (2D spin ice), it is given by\nGSI (K) = sech2 2K (533575 + 1162616 cosh 4K + 1014592 cosh 8K + 774088 cosh 12K\n+436732 cosh 16K + 178200 cosh 20K + 47360 cosh 24K + 6824 cosh 28K + 317 cosh 32K) /\n\u0002\n1024(3 cosh 2K + cosh 6K \u2212 2 sinh 2K)2 (\u22122 cosh 2K + sinh 2K)2\n\u0003\n\u00d7(\u22121 + 5 cosh 4K \u2212 3 sinh 4K)(1 + 3 cosh 4K + sinh 4K)2\n\n\u2212 sech2 2K (440942 sinh 4K + 661942 sinh 8K + 618862 sinh 12K\n+385138 sinh 16K + 163174 sinh 20K + 44430 sinh 24K + 6374 sinh 28K + 303 sinh 32K) /\n\u0002\n1024(3 cosh 2K + cosh 6K \u2212 2 sinh 2K)2 (\u22122 cosh 2K + sinh 2K)2\n\u0003\n\u00d7(\u22121 + 5 cosh 4K \u2212 3 sinh 4K)(1 + 3 cosh 4K + sinh 4K)2 .

The final result of the calculation is qualitatively the\nsame as in the kagom\u00e9 case considered above: the magnetization of the 4-spin cluster can be put\nas\nm\n~ 4\u03b1 (b4A , b4B , b4C , b4D , ~h) \u2243 m\n~ 4\u03b1 (b4A , b4B , b4C , b4D ) + H(K) (b\nn\u03b1 * ~h) n\nb\u03b1 + O(h2 ).\n(75)\nwhere the first term on the right member is given by (48) and H(K) is obtained from the g\u03b1\nfunction for the pyrochlore case as\n~ \u03b1 (K) = \u03c12 \u03c12 \u03c12 \u2202 g\u03b1 (x + n\n,\nbA * ~h, y + n\nbB * ~h, z + n\nbC * ~h)\nH\nx y z\n~h=~0\n\u2202~h\n\n(76)\n\n\f20\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\nK\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 9: K dependence of the functions GI (K) (solid line), GSI (K) (long dashed line) (given by (73) and\n(74), respectively), HI (K) (short dashed line), and HSI (K) (dotted line), (obtained from (76), see text).\n\nAgain, for the cases considered in this work, n\nbA = n\nbB = n\nbC = n\nbD (standard Ising) or n\nbA +\n~\n~\nn\nbB + n\nbC + n\nbD = 0 (spin ice), it can be easily shown that H\u03b1 (K) = H(K) n\nb\u03b1 , where the form of\nthe function H(K) does depend on whether we are considering the standard Ising or the spin ice\nproblem. We will represent by HI (K) the first possibility and by HSI (K) the second. The length\nof these expressions makes them of little practical use and, therefore, we will not quote them here.\nIt is enough for our purposes to give their K dependence by means of Fig. 9.\nNow, by using the scaling relation (4), we can equate the results for the 1-spin cluster with\nthose for the p-spin cluster, as we did in Sec. IV. In doing so, we obtained the following system of\nequations for the internal fields\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nbp\u03b2 = F (K\u2032 ) l\u2212d+2yH \u2212 \u039e(K) (b\nn\u03b1 * n\nb)h,\n(77)\n\u03a6(K) bp\u03b1 + [\u0398(K) \u2212 A(K\u2032 )]\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03a6(K), \u0398(K), and A(K) are the same as in Sec.

The other exponents for the\ndifferent thermodynamic quantities can be obtained from these by making use of the well known\nscaling relations16 (see Table IV). The values listed as \"exact\" are those obtained for the square\nand cubic lattices, as they are expected to be the same as for the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices,\nrespectively, on the basis of the universality hypothesis. The ones corresponding to the square\nlattice are those obtained from the Onsager solution22, whereas the ones for the cubic lattice are\nvalues obtained from high-precision numerical studies23,24,25 .\nThe first conclusion we can extract from the listed values for the standard Ising problem is\nthat the EFRG method provides very reliable estimates for the critical exponents, in spite of the\nfact that we have chosen the smallest possible clusters that include the effects of frustration. In\nthis sense, the exponents calculated in this work are some of the \"best\" that can be found in the\nliterature, calculated in the framework of phenomenological RG approaches. For example, the\nexponents obtained in our work are even better than the ones obtained in the so called Mean Field\nRG method for Ising spins in the square lattice, where clusters of 16 and 25 spins where used12 .\nThe reason for this improvement is in the use of the van der Waerden identity, which exactly\ntakes into account the value of the autocorrelation function. It is also important to note that the\nestimation of \u03bd for the kagom\u00e9 lattice is better than the one for the pyrochlore lattice. The reason\nis that the scaling factor we have used, l = (N/N \u2032 )1/d = p1/d , is smaller for the 3D lattice than for\nthe 2D one. It has been noted by some authors, that the values of the critical exponents calculated\nwith this method can be improved by using an alternative definition of the size of the clusters, in\nterms of the number of interactions including the ones with the spins creating the effective field26 .\nThis point will be further investigated in a future work33 .\nThe last important conclusion we can extract from Table III is that the magnetic critical exponent and, thus, all the exponents depending on this one (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b7), are different for the\nspin ice case. If we take into account the good agreement found for the standard Ising case, we\ncan expect the estimations of the critical exponents for the spin ice case to be of the same quality.\nActually, if we assume that the error in the determination of the critical exponents for the spin ice\ncase is the same as in the standard Ising case (\u2206yH /yH = 0.13 for the kagom\u00e9 Ising case and\n\u2206yH /yH = 0.06 for the pyrochlore Ising), and we see no reason for this not to be the case, we\ncan put an upper and lower bounds for the real value of this exponent, yH = 0.63 \u00b1 0.08 for the\nkagom\u00e9 spin ice, and yH = 1.22 \u00b1 0.07 for the pyrochlore spin ice.

A naive interpretation of these exponents could make us think that our\nresults violate the universality hypothesis. However, it is easy to realize that this is not the case.\nIndeed, the universality hypothesis states that the critical exponents are the same for different systems with Hamiltonians which internal symmetries are the same, independently of details as the\nmicroscopic origin of the interactions or the geometry of the lattice. The results we found for the\nstandard Ising model in both the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices are in good agreement with this\nidea. Moreover, the fact that the thermal exponent does not change when going from Ising spins\nwith a single anisotropy axis, to the spin ice problem, is also in agreement with the universality\nhypothesis, as we have previously shown that the spin ice problem maps on an Ising Hamiltonian\nwith effective interactions given by K = K cos \u03b8. However, when we include the effect of an\nuniform magnetic field in the spin ice case, the Zeeman term cannot be mapped to the Zeeman\nterm in the Ising Hamiltonian with a single anisotropy axis, which is the same for all the spins,\nbut we can see it as a Zeeman which is different for spins located in different sublattices, i.e., it\nP\nis equivalent to some kind of staggered field subject to the condition \u03b1 ~h\u03b1 = ~0, where by ~h\u03b1\nwe represent the magnetic field acting on each sublattice. Certainly, this Zeeman term has not the\nsame symmetry as the original Zeeman term of the Ising spin model with a single anisotropy axis\nand, therefore, we should expect the corresponding magnetic critical exponent to be different from\nthe one of the standard Ising model. Of course, it would be extremely important to have experimental confirmation of this fact, or even estimations of the magnetic critical exponent obtained\nfrom high precision Monte Carlo simulations but, as far as we know, this is the first time that this\nresult is reported.\nAnother interesting point we want to notice here is the connection of these spin ice-like systems\nwith the well known vertex models7,22 . In fact, it is easy to see that the 2D spin ice of this work\nis related to the 8-vertex model, whereas the spin ice on the pyrochlore is related to the 16-vertex\nmodel. On the other hand, it is well known that these vertex models have the peculiarity that the\ncritical exponents depend continuously on the value of the exchange coupling, and this is precisely\nwhat we would expect in our model if we allow for arbitrary orientations of the unit vectors n\nb\u03b1 ,\nfor which n\nbA * n\nbB 6= n\nbA * n\nbB 6= . . .. We think that clearly establishing this connection, though\noutside of the scope of this work, deserves further consideration, as it seems that these spin ice-like\nsystems are one of the few physical realizations of these vertex models34 . In this sense, we think\nthat the present RG scheme could prove to be useful in obtaining qualitative information about\ncritical properties of the 16-vertex model, about which very little is known.\n\n\f23\nVI.\n\nTHE GCC METHOD APPLIED TO THE SPIN ICE PROBLEM\n\nAs stated in the Introduction, it is interesting to compare the results obtained in the previous\nsections with those obtained in the framework of the GCC method, which has been successfully\napplied to the problem of Heisenberg frustrated lattices by the present authors14,15 . In the GCC\nframework, we initially consider isolated units (tetrahedra or triangles, for the pyrochlore and\nkagom\u00e9 lattices, respectively), and later add the interactions with the surrounding units as unknown\neffective fields to be determined by a self consistent condition, which is obtained by comparing\nthe order parameter in the cluster with that of the isolated ion14,27 . We will analyze here the case\nin which the applied magnetic field is zero, even though the generalization is straightforward.\nAs in the previous sections, we will characterize each spin in the frustrated unit by a different\norder parameter. Therefore, the Hamiltonian of the cluster formed by one Ising spin is given by\nX\n~h\u03b2 = 2~s1\u03b1 * \u03be~1\u03b1 ,\n(81)\nH1\u03b1 = 2K ~s1\u03b1\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhere ~h\u03b2 are the internal fields created by the neighboring spins outside the unit, and point along\nthe directions given by n\nb\u03b2 , and we have taken into account that there are 2 neighbors in each\nsublattice. The Hamiltonian of the cluster formed by p spins can be put as\nX\nX\nHp = K\n~s1\u03b1 * ~s1\u03b2 +\n~s1\u03b1 * \u03be~p\u03b1.\n(82)\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b16=\u03b2\n\nWe can then see that the corresponding partition function of the unit has the same functional form\nas eqs. (37) and (47) for the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices, respectively, except for the fact that\nthe average with respect to the full Hamiltonian is absent, and the conjugated fields \u03be~\u03b1 appearing\nin \u03a0\u03b1 depend on the internal fields ~h\u03b2 , rather than on the spin variables of the surrounding spins\noutside the cluster. As stated above, these internal fields are evaluated by imposing the self consistent condition of equating the magnetization per spin in the internal field with that of a unit in\nthe internal field, which can be mathematically stated as\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nm\n~ 1\u03b1 ~hA , ~hB , ~hC , . . . = m\n~ p\u03b1 ~hA , ~hB , ~hC , . . . .\n(83)\nObviously, this equation can only be solved numerically in the general case. However, near the\ncritical point, we expect the internal fields to be very small, so we can expand the order parameters\nto first order in the internal fields. In doing so, we obtain\nX\nm1\u03b1 \u2243 2K\nh\u03b2 ,\n(84)\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nmp\u03b1 = 2K A1 (K) h\u03b1 + A2 (K)\n\nX\n\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nwhere K = K cos \u03b8, as before, and\nA1 (K) =\n\n(\n\n1\u2212e\u22124K\n1+3e\u22124K\n3(1\u2212e\u22128K )\n1+4e\u22126K +3e\u22128K\n\n,\n\nh\u03b2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(85)\n\n\f24\nand\nA2 (K) =\n\n(\n\n1+e\u22124K\n1+3e\u22124K\n3+4e\u22126K +e\u22128K\n1+4e\u22126K +3e\u22128K\n\n,\n\n(86)\n\nwhere the upper (lower) expression corresponds to the kagom\u00e9 (pyrochlore) lattice.\nThen, we arrive to the following system of equations for the effective fields\n\u03a6(K) h\u03b1 + \u0398(K) (h\u03b2 + h\u03b3 + . . . ) = 0, (\u03b1 6= \u03b2 6= \u03b3 6= . . . ),\n\n(87)\n\n\u03a6(K) = A1 (K),\n\n(88)\n\n\u001a \u001b (\n\u2212 3+e24K\n1\n= 1\u22124e\n\u0398(K) = A2 (K) \u2212\n\u22126K \u22125e\u22128K .\n2\n1+4e\u22126K +3e\u22128K\n\n(89)\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nAgain, the upper (lower) expression corresponds to the kagom\u00e9 (pyrochlore) lattice.\nThis system of equations has two non-trivial solutions for\n\u03a6(K) = \u0398(K)\n\n(90)\n\nand\n\u03a6(K) = \u2212(p \u2212 1)\u0398(K).\n(91)\nP\nThe first one corresponds to a configuration in which \u03b1 h\u03b1 = 0, whereas the second one corresponds to a configuration in which hA = hB = hC = . . ., that is, they are the same configurations\nwe found in the EFRG formulation. It is easy to verify that the first kind of solution never occurs\nfor any finite value of K, whereas the second one occurs for a value of Kc = 0.402 for the kagom\u00e9\nlattice and Kc = 0.227 for the pyrochlore lattice, in very good agreement with our previous results\n(see Table I).\nVII.\n\nCONNECTION BETWEEN THE GCC AND EFRG SCHEMES\n\nFrom the previous section, it seems clear that both approaches presented in this work are somehow related. In this section we will furnish this connection. We will consider a system with only\none vectorial order parameter. The generalization to an arbitrary number of order parameters being\nstraightforward.\nThe Hamiltonian of the one spin cluster with only NN interactions can be put as\n!\nz\nX\nH = ~s1 * \u03be~1 = ~s1 * K\n~si ,\n(92)\ni\n\nwhere z is the number of NN. The corresponding order parameter can be obtained then from the\nCallen-Suzuki identity and, in general, it will be a function of the conjugated field \u03be~1\n*\n! +\n\u001c\n\u001d\nz\nD\nE\nX\nX\n\u2202\nm\n~1=\nln Z1 (\u03be~1 )\n= F~ (\u03be~1 )\n=\nF\u03bc K\n~si n\nb\u03bc\n,\n(93)\n~\nH\n\u2202 \u03be1\nH\n\u03bc\ni\nH\n\n\f25\nwhere n\nb\u03bc define the coordinate system.

We can then\neasily see that the GCC self consistency condition corresponds to the particular case of the finite\nsize scaling hypothesis in which one assumes\n~ p,\nm\n~ p\u2032 = m\n\n(99)\n\n~hp\u2032 = ~hp .\n\n(100)\n\nand\nThus, the GCC model corresponds to the lowest order of the EFRG method, in which correlations outside the cluster are neglected and the scaling relation is substituted by strict equality.\nTherefore, the value of the critical point obtained in both methods, to this order of approximation, is the same, as it does not depend on the particular scaling coefficient. However, this has\nprofound consequences for the calculation of other quantities, as the critical exponents, which do\ndepend on the particular scaling relation, as have been noted by some authors12 . The differences\nbetween the values listed in Table I are not related to the use of the EFRG or GCC methods, but\nto the fact that we have used the van der Waerden identity in the case of the EFRG. However, we\ncould make use of this identity in the GCC approach, at least for Ising spins, and the results would\nbe identical to this order of approximation (i.e. up to terms linear in Kc ).\nIt is also important to stress that the results of this section are not limited to the connection\nbetween the EFRG and GCC methods applied to GFAF, as we have not made any assumption\nabout the sizes of the clusters. In this sense, this connection also holds for the original formulation of both the Constant Coupling and EFRG methods, in which clusters with 1 and 2 spins are\ncompared27 . In other words, the Constant Coupling method (in whatever formulation) is the lowest order approximation of the EFRG method, corresponding to neglecting multispin correlations\nand assuming that the anomalous dimension of the order parameter is zero.\n\n\f26\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we have studied the critical behavior of ferro- and antiferromagnetically coupled\nIsing spins with local anisotropy axes in geometrically frustrated geometries (kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlores lattices). The present problem, applied to the pyrochlore lattice with local anisotropy\naxes in high symmetry h1 1 1i-like directions corresponds to the spin ice problem. The critical\npoints have been calculated by means of the effective field renormalization group technique, adequately generalized to deal with the non-Bravais character of the lattices, and by the generalized\nconstant coupling approach. These methods allow us to evaluate both the critical points, if any,\nand the corresponding ground state configurations. The results obtained are in very good agreement with exact results known for the Ising Hamiltonian in the 2D kagom\u00e9 lattice and Monte Carlo\ncalculations for the pyrochlore lattice. For ferromagnetic interactions, geometrical frustration prevents the formation of long range order, whereas for antiferromagnetic ones, there is a transition\nat a finite temperature to a long range ordered state in which all the spins of the unit point outside\nor inside the frustrated unit. These results can be traced back to the fact that this spin ice problem\ncan be mapped to the standard Ising model with an effective interaction given by K = K cos \u03b8,\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between any 2 anisotropy directions. Therefore, ferromagnetic interactions in\nthe spin ice problem correspond to effective antiferromagnetic ones, and vice versa. Incidentally,\nthe connection between the effective field renormalization group technique and the generalized\nconstant coupling method is furnished. It is shown that the GCC method corresponds to the lowest\napproximation of the EFRG scheme, in which correlations outside the cluster are neglected and\nthe anomalous dimension of the order parameter is taken to be zero.\nIn addition, the critical exponents of these systems have been calculated for the transition to\nthe long range ordered state that occurs for effective ferromagnetic interactions. The calculated\nvalues of the critical exponents for spins with parallel anisotropy axes (the standard Ising model),\nare found to be in very good agreement with both those obtained from exact results for the 2D\nsquare lattice and those calculated computationally for the cubic lattice, in spite of the small size\nof the clusters considered in this work. This fact is in agreement with the universality hypothesis.\nFor the spin ice problem (in both the kagom\u00e9 and the pyrochlore lattice), the thermal exponent\nhas the same value as for standard Ising spins, as both Hamiltonians can be identically mapped on\nto each other. However, the magnetic exponent is found to be different from that of the standard\nIsing model in the presence of an uniform magnetic field. This result is expected, as the Zeeman\nterm in this case has different symmetry properties than in the standard Ising model. In any case,\nindependent confirmation of this fact, by experimental or Monte Carlo simulations, would be\ndesirable.\nWe think that the techniques presented in this work will prove to be useful in studying other\nphenomena present in the spin ice system. For example, it would be interesting to study how the\ninclusion of long range dipolar interactions modify the present results, that is, if these additional\ninteractions could remove the degeneracy of the ground state so a long range ordered state is\nformed at any finite temperature for the ferromagnetic case. So far, there are numerical results\nand mean field calculations which indicate that the degeneracy of the ground state is weakly lifted\nby long range dipolar interactions, and there is a finite temperature much lower than the energy\nscale defined by the dipolar interactions at which a long range ordered state given by the ice\nrules is formed28,29 , but we think it would be important also to support this result with analytical\ncalculations that go beyond mean field theory. Also, the effect of a small amount of dilution in\nthe crystalline lattice is an intriguing problem which can be dealt with in the present formalisms.\nMoreover, even though the extension is not trivial, the present EFRG scheme can be generalized to\n\n\f27\ndeal with Heisenberg spins and, thus, shed some light in the fascinating phenomena of geometrical\nfrustration.\nOf course, the EFRG scheme is not exempt of limitations. For example, the inclusion of fluctuating corrections coming from correlations further than NN interactions is not an easy task.\nHowever, there are some methods to deal with this problem30 , though they are highly technical\nand outside of the scope of the present work. This, and some of the problems mentioned in the\nabove paragraph are the directions of our present research.\nAcknowledgments\n\nAJGA wishes to thank the Spanish MEC for financial support under the Subprograma General\nde Perfeccionamiento de Doctores y Tecn\u00f3logos en el Extranjero.\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n\nElectronic address: garcia@landau.physics.wisc.edu\nM.

However, it is a very instructive example,\nand will prove to be useful for testing the accuracy of the results presented in this work.\nThis is the case even if we consider the smallest possible clusters. See, for example, I. P. Fittipaldi and D.\nF. de Alburquerque, J. Magn. Magn. Mat. 104-107, 236 (1992), where they studied the Ising model with\nbond dilution in both the simple square and kagom\u00e9 lattices in the EFRG framework by using clusters\nof 1 and 2 spins, respectively.\nAnother possible definition of the scaling factor we can use consists in calculating from (79) the value\nof l that leads to the exact value of yt for the standard Ising model, and make use of this value to\nestimate the corresponding magnetic critical exponent. The values of l obtained in this way are l = 1.67\nand l = 1.42 for the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore lattices, respectively. The corresponding magnetic critical\nexponents are yH = 1.68 and yH = 2.58, for the standard Ising model in the kagom\u00e9 and pyrochlore\nlattices, respectively, and yH = 0.60 and yH = 1.13, for the 2D spin ice and the 3D spin ice, respectively.\nEven though this is only the case for very special cases, as the ones considered in this work, because\nspin ice systems with arbitrary unitary vectors are, in general, incompatible with the symmetries of the\ncrystalline lattice.\n\n\f"}
