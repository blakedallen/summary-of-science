This may apply to the broad line region. Short cloud\nsurvival and regeneration times can be associated with turbulence (Bottorff & Ferland 2001; Bottorff et al. 2000). The balance between formation and destruction maintains a constant\nBLR cloud number density.\nOur analysis suggests that a nonlinear wind instability resulting from the combination of launching profile + radiation pressure can lead to the formation of a turbulent biconical zone that\nmight manifest itself observationally as the BLR. This biconical structure is the region where flow streamlines cross. Such\na bicone is remarkably similar to that inferred empirically by\nElvis (2000) and from numerical simulations by Proga et al.\n(2000). Growing observational data corroborates the existance\nof such a structure (e.g. NGC 1068 (Arribas et al. 1996), Mrk\n3 (Ruiz et al. 2001), etc.)\nWe formulate the problem in section 2.1 and describe the\nflow field in section 2.2. We analyze the linear and nonlinear\nstability of the flow and a possible scenario for thermal instability resulting in formation of the BLR clouds in section 2.3.\nIn section 3 we discuss the results and their implications for the\nAGN structure and dynamics.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nNon-spherical outflows are a ubiquitous feature of AGN. In\nthis Letter we discuss the stability of such an outflow launched\nnormally from the disk with a decaying power law velocity profile. The motivation for this work is to understand the conditions under which the flow may be unstable to cloud formation,\nand to infer the structure of the region in which such clouds\nmay reside. Elvis (2000) has argued that data require AGN\nBLR clouds to reside in a narrow biconical structure. Our work\nherein supports this possibilty.\nA variety of launching mechanisms for AGN accretion disk\noutflows have been studied: radiatively accelerated outflows\n(Arav et al. 1994), hydrodynamic line-driven winds (Proga et\nal. 1999, 2000), hydromagnetic disk winds (K\u00f6nigl & Kartje\n1994), (Pelletier & Pudritz 1992), thermal wind-type outflows in low luminosity AGNs (Pietrini & Torricelli-Ciamponi\n2000), and others. In this work we parameterize the disk wind\nindependent of the launching mechanism.\nA disk wind outflow can become unstable from linear and\nnonlinear perturbations in velocity, density, temperature, ionization state, etc. These can lead to cloud formation. The cloud\nmodel is a leading, though not unanimously accepted, paradigm\nfor the structure of the AGN BLR regions: models exist with\n(Elvis 2000; Urry & Padovani 1995) and without (Murray &\nChiang 1995; Murray et al. 1995) clouds. The main reason for\nthe lack of agreement is the uncertainty about cloud survival\nin AGN enviroments (Mathews & Ferland 1987). They may\nbe unstable to evaporation (e.g., see (Pier & Voit 1995)), or\nbe insufficiently supported by pressure and be dynamically unstable to shredding (Mathews & Ferland 1987; Poludnenko et\nal. 2002). Among the suggested solutions has been magnetic\nconfinement of clouds (Rees 1987; Bottorff & Ferland 2000).\nHowever a key point is that a typical cloud needs only to exist long enough to reprocess radiation (Rees 1987; Celotti et al.\n1992; Kuncic et al. 1996, 1997). If clouds are destroyed thereafter and new clouds are formed, then the system can exist in\n1\n2\n3\n\n2. DISK WIND MODEL\n\n2.1. Formulation of the problem\nAll of our calculations are performed in cylindrically symmetric geometry, however we do not include axial rotation. At\nthe origin we assume a black hole of mass MBH . Fig. 1 shows\nthe setup.\nWe take a Keplerian, geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk to be located along the abscissae with the distance\n\u03bb measured along the disk. The central engine is taken to be\na point-like source at the origin coincident with the black hole.\nWe exclude disk surface illumination by the central source including all disk properties into the disk-wind launch velocity\nprofile.\n\nwma@pas.rochester.edu\nblackman@pas.rochester.edu\nafrank@pas.rochester.edu\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPoludnenko, Blackman, & Frank\n\nOur wind originates at the disk surface with launch velocity\nprofile\n\u0012 \u0013n\n\u03bb\nvz0 (\u03bb) = v\u2217 \u2217 ,\n(1)\n\u03bb\n\nwhere v\u2217 is the wind velocity at the innermost launch point of\nthe disk with coordinate \u03bb\u2217 and n is an arbitrary non-positive\nnumber4. We assume that the wind propagates into a low density medium.\nAfter the wind material leaves the disk, it is subjected to gravity from the black hole and radiation from the central engine.\nProga et al. (1999, 2000) discuss one possible approach to line\ndriven winds in the context of numerical modeling. To capture\nthe most important qualitative features of the flow and to simplify the analysis we assume a continuum driven wind and use\nonly Thomson opacities. This assumption somewhat underestimates the driving force since it excludes the contribution of\nline-driving. However, on the other hand, it is an overestimate\nsince typically a significant fraction of the central source spectrum lies in the Compton scattering regime. To compensate for\nthat we introduce a factor fT < 1, intended to decrease the total\nluminosity L. The choice of a specific value of fT depends on a\nparticular situation being considered.\nIn our model, a fluid parcel of density \u03c1 leaves the disk with\nthe velocity of equation (1), determined by the coordinate of\nits launch point, and finds itself in a centrally symmetric, conservative potential field. For Thomson scattering the radiative\nforce per unit volume is\nZ\n1 ~r\nn\u03c3T,e ~r\nrad\n~\nF (r) =\nF ,\n(2)\n\u03b1\u03bd F\u03bd d\u03bd =\nc |~r|\nc\n|~r |\nand the effective potential field is\n!\n\u03c1GMBH fT L\n\u03b1\nU(r) = Urad + Ugrav =\n\u22121 = \u03c1 ,\n(3)\nr\nLEdd\nr\nwhere LEdd = 1.25 * 1038 erg/s(MBH /M\u2299 ) is the Eddington luminosity. Note, that here we give an expression for the potential\nenergy per unit volume.\n2.2. Description of the flow field\nFinding a trajectory and velocity of a fluid parcel in the outflow reduces to the problem of the motion of a particle in a\ncentrally symmetric repulsive potential, described by (3). The\ntrajectory is a hyperbola (Landau & Lifshitz 1976), and in polar\ncoordinates is\np\nr(\u03c6) =\n.\n(4)\ne cos \u03c6 \u2212 1\nHere \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]. Eccentricity of the orbit e and parameter of\nthe orbit p are defined as\n\u0012 \u00132n+1\nr0\np\nr0 ,\n(5)\ne = 1 + , p = 2K \u2217\nr0\nr\nwhere r0 = \u03bb0 is the coordinate of the fluid element launch point.\nThe dimensionless quantity\nK = \u03bb\u2217 (v\u2217 )2 /2\u03b1,\n(6)\nis the ratio of the initial kinetic energy of a fluid particle\nlaunched at \u03bb\u2217 to its potential energy and measures the relative\nimportance of the disk wind vs. central radiation source. (K and\nn are the key parameters in our analysis). Equation (4) can be\nconsidered as an implicit solution for \u03bb0 as a function of z and\n4\n\nWe discard positive values of n as unphysical.\n\n\u03bb. For any point (\u03bb, z) we can uniquely determine the launch\npoint of the streamline, \u03bb0 . Fig. 1 shows a sample streamline\npattern.\nThe velocity distribution along a streamline is\n\uf8f1\nr\n\u03b1\nsinh \u03be\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(e + 1)\n,\n\uf8f2 v\u03bb (\u03bb0 , \u03bb) =\n\u03bb\ne\ncosh\n\u03be+1\nr 0\n(7)\ncosh \u03be\n\u03b1 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(e \u2212 1)(e + 1)\n.\n\uf8f3 vz (\u03bb0 , \u03bb) =\n\u03bb0\ne cosh \u03be + 1\n\nParameter \u03be \u2208 [0, +\u221e) is defined by cosh \u03be = (\u03bb/\u03bb0 )(e + 1) \u2212 e.\n2.3. Stabilty analysis\n\nWe base our linear stability analysis for the inviscid case on\nthe Fj\u00f8rtoft theorem, which is derived from the inviscid limit\nof the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, i.e. Rayleigh equation (Yih\n1969; Maslowe 1985). We have studied the outflows with the\nvalues of \u22122.5 \u2264 n \u2264 0.0 and 0.05 \u2264 K \u2264 2.5. In all the regimes\nstudied, the disk wind is linearly stable to infinitesimal velocity\nperturbations.\nHowever a study of equation (4) shows that a non-linear instability can be present in a subregion of the flow. Depending on n, a streamline inclination angle at any given point\n(r, \u03bb) is either a monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing function of \u03bb0 . The condition for the change in the\ncharacter of monotonicity can be obtained: using equation (4)\nwe can determine the inclination angle of a given streamline\ntan \u0398(\u03bb0 , \u03bb) = dz/d\u03bb. Using\n\u0011\nd \u0010\nlim tan \u0398(\u03bb0 , \u03bb) = 0,\n(8)\nd\u03bb0 \u03bb\u2192\u221e\nwe find that the monotonicity changes for n = \u22121/2, i.e. the\nKeplerian disk is the borderline case. This means that for\nn > \u22121/2, each successive streamline is less inclined towards\nthe abscissae axis than the preceding one and eventually intersects all of the preceding streamlines. For n \u2264 \u22121/2 the inclination angle is a monotonically non-increasing function of \u03bb0\nand then the streamlines never intersect.\nThe intersection of two streamlines can be approximated as\nan intersection of two jets of vanishing thickness whose interaction leads to a resultant turbulent jet with an inclination angle\nlying between that of the two original jets (e.g., see (Landau &\nLifshitz 1959)). Therefore, streamline intersection causes the\nbiconical zone of compressible turbulence in the overall diskwind outflow. The extent of such a zone can be estimated: since\nthe streamline inclination angle is a monotonically increasing\nfunction of \u03bb0 , the streamline originating at the innermost radius of the disk is the most inclined one. Therefore, it delineates the lower boundary of the turbulent biconical zone. Its\ninclination angle is\n\u221a\ndz \u2217\ntan \u0398min = lim\n(9)\n(\u03bb , \u03bb) = 2 K + K 2 .\n\u03bb\u2192\u221e d\u03bb\nAn exact shape of the upper boundary of the bicone can be\nfound by solving dz/d\u03bb0 = 0 for \u03bb0 as a function of \u03bb and\nthen substituting it into the equation (4) to find the exact dependence z(\u03bb) for the upper boundary. Instead, we give an approximate expression for the inclination angle of the outer boundary,\nfound by analogy to equation (9):\ntan \u0398max\n\n=\n=\n\ndz\nlim\nd\u03bb (\u03bb0 , \u03bb)\nr\u03bb\u2192\u221e\n\u0010 \u00112(2n+1)\n\u0010 \u00112n+1\n+ K 2 \u03bb\u03bb\u22170\n.\n2 K \u03bb\u03bb\u22170\n\n(10)\n\n\fFormation of Turbulent Cones in Accretion Disk Outflows\nThis defines the basic geometry of the bicone: the inclination angle \u0398 = (\u0398max + \u0398min )/2 and the divergence angle \u2206\u0398 =\n\u0398max \u2212 \u0398min . See Figure 1.\nTypically, the bicone has a divergence angle \u2206\u0398 that slowly\nincreases with radius. Therefore equation (10), which gives the\nlimiting inclination angle of the streamline originating from the\npoint \u03bb0 , depends on the choice of such a particular streamline.\nHowever, the increase in the divergence angle is typically small.\nMoreover, a particular streamline used to determine \u0398max can\nbe determined independently from the properties of the accretion disk or the estimated extent of the outflow.\nThree other effects will enter in a more detailed hydrodynamic treatment that influence the divergence angle of the bicone. An effect which tends to make the divergence angle\nsmaller than that determined using equations (9) and (10) arises\nbecause the resultant of two intersecting jets lies at an intermediate angle between the original two. Each successive interaction of resultant jets would then tend to narrow the overall\nconical structure. In addition, the change in the optical depth\nof the outflow after the formation of the turbulent bicone would\nshade the outer parts of the outflow. This will make the bicone\nnarrower by increasing the inclination angle of the outer streamlines due to the reduced radiation pressure. In competition with\nboth of these above effects is the turbulence itself, which could\nbroaden the bicone.\nThe initial density fluctuations in the turbulent biconical zone\ncannot themselves represent the BELR clouds; the density and\ntemperature contrasts are too small compared to the ambient\nwarm highly ionized gas (WHIM in the nomenclature of Elvis\n(2000)). However, thermal instability in such a medium can\ntransform initial turbulent overdensities into the BELR clouds\n(see (Burkert & Lin 2000; Hennebelle & P\u00e9rault 1999) for the\ndiscussion of two-phase medium formation via linear thermal\ninstability in optically thin regions). The formation of the compressible turbulent bicone from intersecting flows can produce\ninhomogeneities with density contrast up to 4 in the adiabatic\ncase and higher if one allows for the possibility of radiative\ncooling. Such high density contrasts (compared to the linear\ndensity fluctuations discussed by Burkert & Lin (2000)) can\nserve as a seed for thermal instability. The instabilty proceeds\nin the nonlinear regime from the onset. Rapid cooling would\nthen produce clumps. The maximum clump density reached at\na given scale is determined by how much cooling can occur during an eddy turnover time on that scale, i.e. during an average\nclump survival time.\nThis mechanism can lead to a dynamical equilibrium described by the balance between in situ formation, destruction,\nand re-formation of clumps comoving with the ambient flow.\nAs long as any given clump survives long enough to reprocess\nradiation, problems of clump confinement against thermal conduction and destruction via high velocity differences between\nthe clumps and the ambient medium are eliminated. The dynamical equilibrium of the turbulent flow, ensures a constant\nnumber density of BELR clouds in the turbulent biconical zone\nover observation durations.\nFinally, there is a site where a linear instability of the KelvinHelmholtz type might operate, namely the shear layer between\nthe disk wind outflow and the infalling (or stationary) circumpolar material, that fills the cone of the outflow. Simulations\nof Proga et al. (2000) show the formation of clumpy structure\nin that boundary shear layer. They attribute it to the Kelvin5\n\n3\n\nHelmholtz instability. However, in regimes for which the outflow develops the turbulent bicone, such linear instability will\nbe completely overwhelmed by the nonlinear instability induced by the intersection of streamlines. In cases when the\nbicone is not formed, the outflow density decreases from the\nmaximum values near the plane of the disk to nearly the values of the circumpolar infalling material in the upper parts of\nthe outflow with the density transition occurring over the large\nrange of angles. BLR clouds are not expected in this case. 5 .\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nWe considered the linear and nonlinear stability of a disk outflow and found that it is linearly stable to infinitesimal velocity\nperturbations. However, when n > \u22121/2 and a supereddington radiation source is present, nonlinear instability leads to the\nformation of a biconical zone of compressible turbulence. High\ndensity contrasts in this zone may trigger thermal instability and\nlead to the further condensation of clumps into BELR clouds.\nTurbulence plays a key role in establishing the dynamical equilibrium which maintains a steady cloud number density, even\nthough each cloud is short lived.\nIn the regimes when the outflow can develop the turbulent\nbicone, the geometry is remarkably similar to that described by\nElvis (2000). For a disk outflow with K \u2248 0.05 and an initial\nlaunch velocity profile slightly flatter than Keplerian, namely\nn = \u22120.45, the turbulent bicone inclination angle is \u0398 \u2248 28o\nwith the divergence angle \u2206\u0398 \u2248 7o . This is in quantitative and\nqualitative agreement with Elvis (2000): (1) no absorbers are\nalong the line of sight passing above the outflow; (2) along the\nline of sight passing through the turbulent bicone broad absorption and emission line features will be observed; (3) narrow\nabsorption lines (NAL) will be seen along sight lines that fall\ninside of the bicone. Figure 1 shows the geomtry of the outflow\nand the emerging bicone with the angle values found here.\nThe outflow geometry in our picture depends only on dimensionless quantities K and n. However, in addition to \u0398 and \u2206\u0398\ndetermined above, we can also infer the inner scale by matching\nobserved cloud velocities. We assume the same value of n and\nK as in the previous paragraph. We take MBH = 109 M\u2299 and\nbroad absorption line velocity vBAL = 104 km s\u22121 (the velocity\nobserved when the line of sight passes directly along the bicone\ntowards the central source). In our model vBAL is the terminal\nvelocity at infinity of material launched with the largest initial\nvelocity and potential, i.e. at the point \u03bb0 = \u03bb\u2217 . Setting \u03bb0 = \u03bb\u2217\nin (7) and using the expressions for v\u03bb (\u03bb\u2217 , \u03bb) and vz (\u03bb\u2217 , \u03bb) in\nthe limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, we find\n2\u03b1(1 + K)\n\u03bb\u2217 =\n.\n(11)\nv2BAL\nAssuming L = 1.5LEdd and fT = 0.7 the corresponding value of\n\u03bb\u2217 = \u03bb0 \u2248 1000 a.u., which matches Elvis (2000). The corresponding maximum launch velocity is \u2248 2000 km s\u22121 . Therefore, the observed velocity in the NAL region is \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 .\nIn principle, the paradigm presented here applies not only to\nluminous AGN but to any source with a centrally symmetric\npotential, a sufficiently luminous central radiation source, and\na disk wind, e.g. disk winds in young stellar objects.\nWe have not discussed the role of magnetic fields, disk rotation, metallicity, wind density fall off, or the physics of line\ndriving. These should be considered in future work.\nThe authors thank V. Pariev for extremely important com-\n\nNote, that even in the cases when the turbulent bicone is absent the upper boundary of the outflow is still roughly defined by the streamline launched at \u03bb\u2217 .\n\n\f4\n\nPoludnenko, Blackman, & Frank\n\nments and suggestions.
