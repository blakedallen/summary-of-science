The QHE\nrequires three steps: thermalization, quantum measurement, and quantum feedback controlled by\nthe Maxwell demon. We derive the positive-work condition and operation efficiency of this composite\nQHE. Using controllable superconducting quantum circuits as an example, we show how to construct\nour QHE. The essential role of the demon is explicitly demonstrated in this macroscopic QHE.\nPACS numbers: 05.30.-d, 03.67.-a, 85.25.Cp\n\nIntroduction.- A Maxwell demon is a construct that\ncan distinguish the velocities of individual gas molecules\nand then separate hot and cold molecules into two domains of a container, so that the two domains will have\ndifferent temperatures [1]. This result seems to contradict the second law of thermodynamics, because one can\nput a heat engine between them to extract work. The solution of this puzzle [1] refers to the so-called Landauer's\nprinciple [2, 3] that essentially links information theory\nwith fundamental physics [4]. Several quantum heat engines (QHEs) assisted by Maxwell's demons have been\nproposed in Refs. [5, 6, 7].\nHere, we propose a new QHE model integrated with a\nbuilt-in quantum Maxwell's demon performing both: the\nquantum measurement on the working substance, and\nthe feedback control for the system according to the measurement. We demonstrate the role of Maxwell's demon\nin a fully quantum manner. The thermodynamic cycle in\nour setup contains three fundamental stages: (i) a CNOT\noperation, making a pre-measurement to extract information from the working substance; (ii) the feedbackaction of the demon controlling the working substance to\nextract work; and (iii) the disentanglement process that\nthermalizes the working substance and the demon by two\nseparate thermal baths. The demon plays a role in the\nfirst two steps.\nWe further illustrate how to implement our QHE using superconducting qubit circuits [8, 9]. In our setup,\nthe demon-assisted working substance does work via two\nCNOT operations, which can be realized by single-qubit\noperations and an easily realized i-SWAP operation. The\nCNOT operation performs the basic functions of the\nquantum demon.\nMaxwell's demon-assisted thermodynamic cycle in twoqubit system.- Our QHE cycle is similar to a quantum\nOtto cycle [10] described in Ref. [11] and generalized in\nRef. [12]. Here, the QHE, shown in Fig. 1, is a composite system consisting of two qubits: the \"working substance\" S and the quantum Maxwell's demon D.

Schematics of the Maxwell's-demonbased quantum heat engine (QHE). The qubit S is the \"working substance\" system, which is monitored and then controlled by another qubit D, acting as a Maxwell's demon.\nThe central circle with the letter \"c\" denotes a switchable\ncoupling between the S and the D. S plus D form the QHE.\nQin and Qout indicate the heat absorbed and released; W denotes the work done. When the erasure of D is included in\nthe cycle, according to Landauer's principle, the violation of\nthe Second Law is prevented.\n\nare separately coupled to two different heat baths with\nthe temperatures TS and TD . Using the Pauli matrices\n(F )\n\u03c3\u03b1 (F = S, D; \u03b1 = x, y, z), the model Hamiltonian can\nbe written as\nX\nHI =\n\u2206F \u03c3z(F ) + EL (\u03c3x(S) \u03c3x(D) \u2212 \u03c3y(S) \u03c3y(D) ), (1)\nF =S,D\n\nwhere \u2206F is the level spacing of the qubits and EL is a\ncontrollable coupling strength between S and D. Using\nboth the controllable XY interaction and on-site potentials in Eq. (1), we can realize various quantum logic\noperations [13]. Now, let us study each step of our QHE\ncycle and calculate the work done and the heat absorbed\nin each step of the thermodynamic cycle.\nS1 : S and D are decoupled by setting EL = 0\nin Eq. (1) and separately coupled to two heat baths\n\n\f2\nwith different temperatures TS and TD . As shown below, whatever are the initial states of S and D, either entangled or separated, after a thermalization, they\nwill reach their respective equilibrium states: \u03c1F (1) =\npF (0)|0F ih0F | + pF (1)|1F ih1F |, with F = S or D. Here,\npF (1) = exp(\u2212\u03b2F \u2206F )/zF , and pF (0) = 1/zF , are the\nBoltzmann probability distributions for two energy levels; zF = 1 + exp(\u2212\u03b2F \u2206F ) is the partition function with\n\u03b2F = 1/(kB TF ), where kB is the Boltzmann constant.\nWe have chosen the ground state energy as zero. The\nthermalized state \u03c1(1) = \u03c1S (1) \u2297 \u03c1D (1) of the total system is\n1,1\n1,0\n\u03c1(1) = pS,D\n|1, 1ih1, 1| + pS,D\n|1, 0ih1, 0|\n\n(2)\n\n0,1\n0,0\n+ pS,D\n|0, 1ih0, 1| + pS,D\n|0, 0ih0, 0|,\n\nwhere for F, F \u2032 = S, D and q, q \u2032 = 0, 1, |q, q \u2032 i \u2261\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|qS i \u2297 |qD\ni and pq,q\nF,F \u2032 \u2261 pF (q) pF \u2032 (q ) being the joint\nprobabilities.\nS2 : The second step is a CNOT operation flipping the\ndemon states only when the working substance system is\nin its excited state [6]. In this step, the demon acquires\ninformation about the system. This CNOT process can\nbe realized [13] by the controllable Hamiltonian (1) and\nis assumed to be so short that the coupling of S and D\nto the baths can be ignored. Thus, \u03c1(1), after the second\nstep, is changed to\n1,1\n1,0\n\u03c1(2) = pS,D\n|1, 0ih1, 0| + pS,D\n|1, 1ih1, 1|\n\n(3)\n\n0,0\n0,1\n|0, 0ih0, 0|.\n|0, 1ih0, 1| + pS,D\n+pS,D\n\nThe entropy of \u03c1(2) is equal to that of \u03c1(1), i.e., measurements do not lead to entropy increase [2, 3, 5]. This\nagrees well with Landauer's principle.\nS3 : In the third step, the demon controls the system\nto do work according to the information acquired by the\ndemon about the system. Physically, the system experiences a conditional evolution (CEV) Uc which can be\n\u2032\nrealized by the Hamiltonian (1), that is, |qS i \u2297 |qD\ni\u2192\n\u2032\nq\n\u2032\n(Uc ) |qS i \u2297 |qD i and Uc |qS i = |q\u0303S i. Here, 1\u0303S =\ncos \u03b8 |1S i + sin \u03b8 exp(i\u03c6) |0S i, and 0\u0303S = \u2212 sin \u03b8 |1S i +\ncos \u03b8 exp(i\u03c6) |0S i, are the states of the working substance\nafter the conditional evolution; \u03b8 and \u03c6 are real parameters. A CNOT is a special CEV for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. After the\nthird step, the density matrix \u03c1(2) evolves into\n1,1\n1,0\n1\u0303, 1\n\u03c1(3) = pS,D\n|1, 0i h1, 0| + pS,D\n0,1\n+pS,D\n0\u0303, 1\n\n1\u0303, 1\n\n(4)\n\n0,0\n0\u0303, 1 + pS,D\n|0, 0i h0, 0| .\n\nFinally, the system and the demon are decoupled by\nsetting EL = 0 in Eq. (1) and brought into contact with\ntheir own baths again, and then a new cycle starts. For\neach cycle described above, we are now able to calculate the work performed by the heat engine as W =\n2\n1,0\n1,0\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2212 (ES\u2032\u2032 + ED\n\u2212 ES \u2212 ED ) = \u2206S (pS,D\n\u2212 pS,D\n1\u0303 |1i \u2212\n\n2\n\n1,1\n1,0\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\np0,1\nS,D 0\u0303 |1i )+\u2206D (pS,D \u2212pS,D ), where ES (ES ) and ED\n(ED ) are the internal energies of the system and demon,\nrespectively, after the third (first) step. The heat absorbed by the system from the heat bath is Qin = ES \u2212ES\u2032\u2032\n2\n2\n1,0\n0,1\n= \u2206S (p1,0\nS,D \u2212pS,D 1\u0303 |1i \u2212pS,D 0\u0303 |1i ). Based on the\nabove results, the operation efficiency \u03b7 can be given as\n\n\u03b7 = W/Qin = 1 \u2212 (\u2206D /\u2206S )\u03be\n\n(5)\n\nwith\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n1,0\n0,1\n1,0\n\u03be = csc2 \u03b8 p1,1\n/p\n\u2212\n1\np\n/p\n\u2212\n1\n.\nS,D\nS,D\nS,D\nS,D\n\n(6)\n\nEquation (5) shows that \u03be \u2265 0 (to guarantee the operation efficiency \u03b7 < 1). The first factor of \u03be in Eq. (6)\nis positive, while the second factor, which can be simplified to exp(\u2212\u03b2D \u2206D ) \u2212 1, is negative. Thus, we can\nconclude that the third factor of \u03be in Eq. (6) is negative.\nThis results in TS \u2265 TD (\u2206S /\u2206D ), and it agrees well with\nthe positive-work condition [11, 12] for a simple quantum\nOtto cycle without Maxwell's demon. This coincidence is\nnontrivial since here TS and TD are the temperatures of\nthe baths surrounding qubits S and D in the whole cycle.\nThis is different from the temperatures in Refs. [11, 12],\nwhere the two temperatures are defined by two different\nisochoric steps in thermodynamic cycles.\nRemarks on the QHE cycle and the roles of the quantum Maxwell's demon.- Let us further understand each\nstep in the above QHE operations. We first consider\nthe thermalization problems for the two qubits coupled\nto two separated baths, which can be modelled as two\ncollections of harmonic oscillators with different temperatures, e.g., TS and TD . The baths have the average\nthermal excitation n(TF , \u03c9F ) = 1/[exp(\u03b2F \u03c9F ) \u2212 1] in\nthe mode with frequency \u03c9F (F = S, D) of the baths.\nAfter thermalization, the population difference of F can\nbe calculated [16] as\nh\u03c3z(F ) (t)i =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 (F )\nh\u03c3z (0)iMF + 1 e\u22122\u03b3F t \u2212(1/MF ) , (7)\n2\n\nwhere MF = 1 + 2 n(TF , \u2206F ) is time-independent. The\ndamping rate \u03b3F of F depends on the specific physical realization. When t \u226b 1/\u03b3F , F will approach its\n(F )\nsteady state \u03c1F (1) in Eq. (2) with h\u03c3z (t \u2192 \u221e)is =\n\u22121/MF . Then, we can obtain the equilibrium distribution, pF (1) = (1 \u2212 1/MF )/2, of the two-level system,\n(F )\nusing pF (1) \u00b1 pF (0) = h\u03c3z (t)i(1\u22131)/2 . It is crucial that\n(F )\nthe steady term h\u03c3z (t \u2192 \u221e)is in Eq. (7) is independent of the initial state, since the initial information is\nerased by quantum dissipation, with damping rate \u03b3F .\nHence, whatever initial state the total system is (e.g., an\nentangled state), the final steady state of S or D would\nbe in its own thermal equilibrium state.\nThe CNOT operation in the step S2 can be referred\nto a one-bit quantum pre-measurement on the quantum\n\n\f3\n(a)\n\n\u2297\n\nCgS\n\nL\n\n\u2297\n\nS\n\n\u2297\n\nCgD\n\nD\n\nVgS\n\nVgD\n\n(b)\n\uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 2 \uf8fa\uf8fb\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 2 \uf8fa\uf8fb\nX\n\nX\n\n\uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8f9\n\uf8f0\uf8ef 2 \uf8fb\uf8fa\n\nX\n\n\uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8f9\n\uf8f0\uf8ef 2 \uf8fb\uf8fa\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nS\ni\u2013SwAP\n\n\uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8f9\n\uf8f0\uf8ef 2 \uf8fb\uf8fa\n\ni\u2013SwAP\n\nZ\n\ni\u2013SwAP\n\n\uf8ee \u03c0\uf8f9\n\u2212\n\uf8f0\uf8ef 2 \uf8fb\uf8fa\n\n\uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8f9\n\uf8f0\uf8ef 2 \uf8fb\uf8fa\n\ni\u2013SwAP\n\nsystem S by the Maxwell's demon [5]. As for the CEV\nin step S3, we noticed that, when we choose i) the CEV\nto be a special case \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, i.e., a CNOT, and ii) the\ntemperature TD to be so low that exp(\u2212\u03b2D \u2206D ) \u226a 1,\ni.e., the demon is \"erased\" nearly to its ground state\n\u03c1D (1) \u2248 |0D i h0D | [15], the efficiency of our QHE Eq. (5)\nbecomes \u03b7 = 1 \u2212 (\u2206D /\u2206S ). This is exactly the efficiency\nof a simple quantum Otto cycle without Maxwell's demon\n[10, 11, 12]. Otherwise the operation efficiency (5) is less\nthan the efficiency of a simple quantum Otto cycle. This\nis because i) when TD is vanishingly small, the demon\ncan be restored to a zero-entropy \"standard state\" [3,\n15] to acquire information about the system in the most\nefficient way, and ii) among all CEVs the CNOT is the\noptimum operation to extract work.\nOne might ignore the effect of the demon by only considering the reduced density matrix \u03c1S = TrD [\u03c1] of S by\ntracing over the variable of D. After the step S3, one has\nthe reduced density matrix \u03c1S (3) = TrD [\u03c1(3)]. The following thermalization of \u03c1S (3) restores S into its initial\nequilibrium state \u03c1S (1) by absorbing heat. Therefore,\nthe net result of ignoring the demon means that there\nexists a perpetual machine of the second kind, which absorbs heat from a single heat bath and converts it into\nwork. This obvious violation of the second law of thermodynamics leads to the so-called \"Maxwell's demon paradox\". When the demon is included in the thermodynamic\ncycle, however, the \"paradox\" disappears and the violation of the second law is prevented. Hence the present\nconcrete model shows the effect of Maxwell's demon and\nverifies the prediction of Landauer's principle.\nExperimental implementation based on superconducting systems.- The above Maxwell's demon assisted QHE\nmodel can be demonstrated by a realistic system, e.g., the\nsuperconducting quantum circuit illustrated in Fig. 2(a),\ndescribed by the Hamiltonian (1). Here, two qubits S and\nD are specified to two charge qubits [8] with the controllable level spacings \u2206F = EcF |ngF \u2212 1/2| (F = S, D),\nmanipulated by the gate voltages VgF , where EcF is the\neffective charging energy and ngF = VgF CgF /2e is the\noffset reduced gate charge of the qubit F . Here, the magnetic fluxes threading the two qubits are set to \u03a60 /2. The\ncoupling constant EL = E0 cos(\u03c0\u03a6x /\u03a60 ) can be tuned to\nzero by the external magnetic flux \u03a6x through the dc\nSQUID L, where E0 is the Josephson tunnelling energy.\nTherefore, the inter-qubit coupling can be switched on\nand off by the magnetic flux \u03a6x . Below We explain how\nto implement our QHE by using the circuit in Fig. 2(a).\nTo implement the step S1 in our proposal, we turn\noff the interaction between two qubits by applying the\nmagnetic flux \u03a6x = \u03a60 /2. The two charge qubits are\ncoupled to their own baths, which can be realized by\ntwo local temperatures TS and TD . This temperature\ndifference can be guaranteed by temperature gradient.\nThus, with a thermalization time of about 1 \u223c 10 \u03bcs [17],\ntwo superconducting charge qubits can reach their own\n\n\uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8f9\n\uf8f0\uf8ef 2 \uf8fb\uf8fa\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nFIG. 2: (color online). A Maxwell's demon QHE implemented\nby a superconducting circuit. (a) two charge qubits S and D\nwith different localized temperatures function as the working substance and the demon, respectively. VgF and CgF are\nthe gate voltage and capacitance of qubit F . (b) The quantum logic operations (two CNOTs) to simulate the demon\nare realized by four i-SWAP operations together with several\nsingle-bit operations [13], e.g., [\u0398]X , a \u0398-rotation along the\nx axis. Here \u0398 = \u00b1\u03c0/2. The quantum control to implement\nthese operations is carried out by the dc SQUID L in (a).\n\nequilibrium states, described by Eq. (2). The population\nof each qubit is described by the steady term of Eq. (7).\nAfter two qubits reach their equilibrium states, the\nstep S2 starts to implement a CNOT operation with\nthe demon being the target qubit, and the working substance being the controlling qubit. This CNOT can be\nobtained [13] as follows: First, two single-qubit operations, [\u03c0/2]X and [\u03c0/2]Z , are applied on the system as\nwell as one single-qubit operation, [\u2212\u03c0/2]Z , on the demon, here [\u0398]i (i = X, Z) denotes a \u0398-rotation along the\ni axis. Second, we turn on the two-qubit interaction by\nsetting \u03a6x = 0 and ngS \u2248 ngD \u2248 1/2. Then, two coupled qubits evolve in time t0 = \u03c0~/(4E0 ) (about 1 \u223c 10\nns [8]) through the Hamiltonian (1) to get an i-SWAP\noperation. Third, turn off the two-qubit interaction, and\na [\u03c0/2]X operation is only applied to the demon. Fourth,\nthe two-qubit interaction is turn on again and the two\nqubits evolve t0 = \u03c0~/(4E0 ). Finally, switch off the twoqubit interaction, and a [\u03c0/2]Z operation is applied to\nthe system. After these steps, a CNOT operation is implemented on the two qubits by the quantum circuit in\nFig. 2(a) and Eq. (3) is obtained.\nWe now consider the step S3. In our proposed experimental setup in Fig. 2(a), the CEV operation in the step\nS3 is chosen as a CNOT operation, with the demon being\nthe controlling qubit, and the working substance being\nthe target qubit. This CNOT can be obtained similarly\n\n\f4\nas the step S2. In this case, the work done by the QHE\nis maximum, since the demon flips the system from the\nexcited state |1iS to the ground state |0iS . After the step\nS3, the qubit interaction is switched off by \u03a6x = \u03a60 /2,\nthen our QHE starts a new cycle. The two CNOT operations used in S2 and S3 are schematically shown in\nFig. 2(b). The total time for these two operations in the\ncharge-qubit circuits [8] is \u223c 10 ns, which is much less\nthan the relaxation time 1 \u223c 10 \u03bcs [17].\nIn the above quantum circuits, if the temperature TD is\nso low that exp(\u2212\u03b2D \u2206D ) \u226a 1, the efficiency \u03b7 in Eq. (5)\nof our proposed QHE approaches \u03b7 = 1 \u2212 \u2206D /\u2206S of a\nsimple quantum Otto heat engine [10, 11, 12]. In the\nexperimental setup, the parameters usually are of the\nfollowing order of the magnitude [18]: EcS \u223c 10\u221223 J,\n|2ngS \u2212 1| \u223c 10\u22122 , TS \u223c 10\u22122 K. Hence, exp(\u2212\u03b2S \u2206S ) \u223c\ne\u22121 . If we choose EcS \u223c EcD and TD \u223c (TS /10) \u223c 10\u22123\nK, then we certainly have exp(\u2212\u03b2D \u2206D ) \u223c e\u221210 \u226a 1.\nUsing the parameters about \u2206D and \u2206S of the superconducting qubits, the efficiency \u03b7 of the QHE can be\nfurther given by\n\u03b7 =1\u2212\n\n|2ngD \u2212 1|\n,\n|2ngS \u2212 1|\n\n(8)\n\nwhich is independent of TS and TD . Here, we have adjusted the macroscopic quantum circuit to be symmetric\nwith respect to D and S by choosing EcS = EcD . For\ninstance, if ngD = 0.498 and ngS = 0.492, the efficiency\nbecomes \u03b7 = 0.75.\nThe derived expression, in Eq. (8), for the QHE efficiency could be tested by experiments on superconducting qubit circuits. There are three important conditions\nfor the experimental implementation of our QHE: i) controllable two-qubit operations; ii) two different temperatures TS and TD for the two nearby qubits; and iii)\nprecise measurements of the power of the microwave\nirradiations. The first one has been discussed above.\nThe second condition could be achieved by a temperature gradient on the chip. For the third condition, a\nprecise measurement of the power spectrum of the microwave is experimentally accessible in these circuits.\nHence, the heat Qin absorbed by S and the heat Qout\nreleased by D can be measured, when they are in contact with their respective baths in the step S1. Similar\nto the arguments in Ref. [6, 7, 11, 12], the work produced in this cycle depends on the conservation of energy W = Qin \u2212 Qout and does not depend on the specific operation performed. We can also estimate the output power of the QHE. From Eqs. (5) and (8), we have\nW \u223c \u03b7Qin \u223c \u03b7 \u2206S pS (1) \u223c 10\u221225 J, and the time interval\nof a cycle is about \u03c4 \u223c 10 \u03bcs. Hence the output power\nbecomes P = W/\u03c4 \u223c 10\u221220 J s\u22121 . We emphasize that\nwe are now interested in conceptual designs of new types\nof QHEs, rather than their engineering applications.\nIn summary, we have studied the operation of a\nMaxwell's-demon-assisted QHE and justified the predic-\n\ntions of Landauer's principle: i) a measurement does not\nnecessarily lead to entropy increase [2, 3, 5]; and ii) the\napparent violation of the second law does not hold when\nthe restoration of the demon's memory is included in the\ncycle [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], because under certain conditions, our composite QHE is equivalent to a simple quantum Otto engine. We also use superconducting quantum\ncircuits as an example showing how to implement this\nQHE.\nFN is supported in part by NSA, LPS, ARO, and NSF.\nCPS is partially supported by the NSFC and NFRP of\nChina.\n\n[1] H.S.
