This extends previous studies\nof homogeneous models to inhomogeneous ones where interesting field theory aspects\narise. A comparison between a reduced quantization and a derivation of the model\nfrom the full theory is presented in detail, with an emphasis on the resulting quantum\nrepresentation. Similar concepts for Einstein\u2013Rosen waves are discussed briefly.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince general relativity predicts singularities generically, and in particular in physically\ninteresting situations such as cosmology and black holes, it cannot be complete as a physical\ntheory. The situation improves when one quantizes general relativity in a background\nindependent manner, following loop quantum gravity [1]. The dynamics of the full theory\nis not yet settled and is rather complicated, as expected for a full quantum theory of gravity.\nEven classically one usually introduces symmetries for physical applications, which can also\nbe done in loop quantum gravity directly. This in fact lead to the conclusion that isotropic\nmodels in loop quantum cosmology [2] are non-singular [3] while at the same time they\nshow the usual classical behavior at large scales [4].\nOne has to keep in mind, though, that symmetric models in a quantum theory play\na role different from symmetric classical solutions. While the latter are exact solutions of\nthe full theory, the former are obtained from the full theory by completely ignoring many\ndegrees of freedom which violates their uncertainty relations. One thus should weaken the\nsymmetry by looking at less symmetric models, and check if results obtained are robust.\nFor the isotropic results, this has been shown to be the case in a first step, reducing the\nisotropy by using anisotropic but still homogeneous models [5, 6]. This did not only show\nthat the same mechanism for singularity freedom applied, and this in a more non-trivial\n\u2217\n\ne-mail address: mabo@aei.mpg.de\n\n1\n\n\fway, but also lead to new applications [7]. The latter allow tentative conclusions even for\ngeneral, inhomogeneous singularities [8].\nNevertheless, one should go ahead and reduce the symmetry further. The next step\nmust deal with inhomogeneous models, which for simplicity can first be taken to be 1 + 1\ndimensional. This would also allow new physical applications concerning, e.g., spherically symmetric black holes and cylindrical gravitational waves. Furthermore, they allow\nadditional tests of issues in the full theory which trivialize in homogeneous models, including field theory aspects, the constraint algebra and the role of anomalies, and specific\nconstructions of semiclassical states using graphs. For 1 + 1 dimensional models several\nalternative background independent quantization schemes have been applied, which can\nthen be compared with loop results. The spherically symmetric model has been dealt\nwith in the Dirac program [9] as well as in a reduced phase space quantization [10, 11].\nEinstein\u2013Rosen waves can be mapped to a free field on flat space-time allowing standard\nFock quantization techniques [12], and there are several other interesting models with a\ntwo-dimensional Abelian symmetry group which have been quantized and studied extensively [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. A wide class of models, which have finitely many physical\ndegrees of freedom and also include the spherically symmetric model, is given by dilaton\ngravity in two dimensions [20] or, more generally, Poisson Sigma Models [21]. These models\nhave been quantized exactly in a background independent way with reduced phase space,\nDirac or path integral methods.\nThe reason for the simplification in homogeneous models, which lead to explicit cosmological applications, is not just the finite number of degrees of freedom, but also a\nsimplification of the volume operator (which at first sight is not always explicit [22]). In\nisotropic as well as diagonal homogeneous models the volume spectrum can be computed\nexplicitly, which is not possible in the full theory. Since the volume operator plays a major\nrole in defining the dynamics [23], also the evolution equation can be obtained and analyzed\nin an explicit form. One can see that this is a consequence of either a non-trivial isotropy\nsubgroup of the symmetry group, or of a diagonalization condition. Similar simplifications\ncan be expected more generally, in particular in those inhomogeneous models which have\na non-trivial isotropy group (spherical symmetry) or a diagonalization condition on the\nbasic variables (polarized waves).\nNevertheless, the explicit reduction of spherically symmetric models done later in this\npaper, and also that of polarized cylindrical waves, shows that suitable canonical variables\ndisplay a feature different from both the full theory and from homogeneous models: flux\nvariables (canonical momenta of the connection) are not identical to the densitized triad\nwhich contains all information about spatial geometry. (A similar feature, though in a\ndifferent manner, happens in the full theory when a scalar is coupled non-minimally [24].)\nInstead, the triad is a rather complicated function of the basic variables and in particular\ndepends also on the connection. This seems to lead to an unexpected complication for the\nvolume operator, and shows that 1+1 models are more complicated than homogeneous ones\nnot just for the obvious reason of having infinitely many kinematical degrees of freedom,\nbut also due to their canonical structure. The complicated expression for the triad could,\na priori, even lead to a continuous volume spectrum, which would be difficult to reconcile\n2\n\n\fwith the full theory and homogeneous models. We will deal with the volume operator\nelsewhere [25], but already in this paper, where we introduce the kinematical setup and\ndiscuss states and basic operators for connections and their momenta, we can see that this\nissue can have an influence on semiclassical properties.\nWe will start by recalling the definition of symmetric states in a quantum theory of\nconnections, and then reduce the full phase space to that of the spherically symmetric\nsector. We introduce the states of the model by two procedures, first by loop quantizing\nthe classically reduced phase space and then by reducing states of the full theory to be\nspherically symmetric. Both procedures lead to the same result, which is a \"mixed\" quantization based on generalized connections, as in the full theory [26], as well as elements of\nthe Bohr compactification of the real line, which is characteristic for homogeneous models\n[27]. Quantum numbers of the reduced quantization match with the spin labels obtained\nby restricting full states, and gauge invariant reduced states satisfy the reduced Gauss\nconstraint. Basic operators on those states are given by holonomies and fluxes, which suggest conditions for the semiclassical regime. Finally, we will briefly discuss the model of\nEinstein\u2013Rosen waves.\n\n2\n\nSymmetric states\n\nLet \u03a3 be a manifold carrying an action of a symmetry group S such that there is a dense\nsubset of \u03a3 where the group action has an isotropy subgroup isomorphic to F < S. In\nthis case \u03a3, except for isolated points (symmetry axes or centers), can be decomposed\nas \u03a3 \u223c\n= B \u00d7 S/F with the reduced manifold B = \u03a3/S. On the symmetry orbits S/F\nthere is a natural invariant metric which follows from the transitive group action, as well\nas preferred coordinates. On B, on the other hand, there is no natural metric and no\npreferred coordinates.\nA given symmetry group S acting on a manifold \u03a3 defines a class of inequivalent\nprincipal fiber bundles P (\u03a3, G), for a given group G, which carry a lift of the action\nof S from \u03a3 to P [28, 29]. For each such symmetric bundle there is a set of invariant\nconnections having a LG-valued 1-form on P satisfying s\u2217 \u03c9 = \u03c9 for each s \u2208 S, giving rise\n(k)\nto different embeddings rk : Ainv \u2192 A in the full space of connections. Here, k is a label\n(topological charge) characterizing the type of symmetric bundle used. In a gravitational\nsituation, where there is an additional condition that spaces of connections must allow\nnon-degenerate dual vector fields, the would-be non-degenerate triads, usually only one\nvalue for the label k can be used such that we will suppress it later on.\nAn invariant connection then has the general form A = AB +AS/F where AB is a reduced\nconnection over B, in general with a reduced gauge group, and AS/F contains additional\nfields in an associate bundle transforming as scalars taking values in a certain representation\nof the reduced structure group. The different forms rk of embedding invariant connections\ninto the full space of connections are classified by homomorphisms \u03bbk : F \u2192 G up to\nconjugacy in G. This map also determines the reduced structure group for the connections\nAB as the centralizer ZG (\u03bbk (F )) in G. The additional fields in AS/F are the components\n3\n\n\fof a linear map \u03c6 : LF\u22a5 \u2192 LG where the space S/F is assumed to be reductive, i.e., there\nis a decomposition LS = LF \u2295 LF\u22a5 such that LF\u22a5 is fixed by the adjoint action of F .\nThere are additional linear conditions \u03c6 has to satisfy when it comes from a full connection,\nnamely\n\u03c6(Adf X) = Ad\u03bbk (f ) \u03c6(X)\n(1)\nfor all X \u2208 LF\u22a5 and f \u2208 F .\n\n2.1\n\nReduced loop quantization\n\nLoop quantum gravity provides techniques to quantize theories of connections, possibly\ncoupled to other fields, in a background independent manner. Following this procedure,\nthe component AB , which plays the role of the connection of the reduced theory, will be\nquantized by using its holonomies along curves in B as basic variables [26]. This leads\nto the space of generalized reduced connections, \u0100B . Scalars like those in AS/F can be\nquantized according to [30, 31] with the result that the classical real values of the field\nare replaced by values in the Bohr compactification of the real line. In this way, the space\n\u0100B\u00d7S/F of generalized connections and scalar fields becomes a compact group which carries\na Haar measure \u03bc0 . The Hilbert space L2 (\u0100B\u00d7S/F , \u03bc0 ) is then obtained by completing the\nspace of continuous functions on this group with respect to the Haar measure.\nHolonomies of the connection and analogous expressions for the scalar act as multiplication operators, while the momenta of the connection components, which can be written\nas fluxes, act as derivative operators. Both sets of basic operators are subsequently used\nto quantize more complicated, composite expressions.\n\n2.2\n\nSymmetric states from the full theory\n\nUsing the connection representation of states on the space of generalized connections,\nsymmetric states can be defined in the full theory as distributional states supported only\non invariant connections [32, 33] for a given symmetry. It is clear that such a state can\nalso be represented as a function \u03c8 on the space of reduced connections as before, but in\naddition it acquires an interpretation as a distribution in the full theory, i.e. as a linear\nfunctional on the space of cylindrical states depending only on finitely many holonomies\nand scalar values: for any cylindrical function f on the full space of connections,\nZ\n\u03a8[f ] :=\nd\u03bc0 (A)\u03c8(A) * rk\u2217 f (A)\n(2)\n(k)\n\n\u0100B\u00d7S/F\n\ndefines a distribution in the full theory. Symmetric states thus form a subspace of the full\n(k)\ndistributional space which, using the measure on \u0100B\u00d7S/F can be equipped with an inner\nproduct.\nOperators \u00d4 of the full theory act on distributions \u03a8 via the dual action which defines\n\u00d4\u03a8 by\n\u00d4\u03a8[f ] = \u03a8[\u00d4 \u2020f ] for all f \u2208 Cyl .\n4\n\n\fIn general, however, \u00d4\u03a8 will not be a symmetric state even if \u03a8 is. The reason is that\non states in the connection representation only the condition of having invariant A has\nbeen incorporated, but not the condition for invariant momenta E. Then, even classically\nthe flow generated by a phase space function would in general not be tangential to the\nsubspace given by invariant connections and arbitrary triads.\nFor general operators it is therefore necessary to implement the condition for invariant\ntriads, which must be done by modifying the operators suitably. This is a complicated\nprocedure which has not been developed in detail yet. Fortunately, one can use particular\noperators in the full theory whose dual action leaves the space of symmetric states invariant\nsuch that one can directly use them in the reduced model. Classical analogs of those\noperators generate a flow which is tangential to the subspace of invariant connections in\nphase space even if triads can be arbitrary. It is easy to see that such functions have to\nbe linear in the triads (which is, however, not a sufficient condition). In fact, the reduced\nbasic variables, holonomies and fluxes, are linear in the triads, and can be written such that\nthey generate a flow parallel to invariant connections. Moreover, for the basic quantities,\nthe classical Poisson *-algebra is represented faithfully on the Hilbert space such that\nthe classical flow on phase space corresponds to a unitary transformation in the quantum\ntheory. Thus, quantizations of basic variables will map symmetric states to symmetric\nstates and can be used directly to derive the reduced operators. States as well as basic\noperators of a model are then defined directly in the full theory, and more complicated\noperators can be constructed from the basic ones following the lines of the full theory. An\nadvantage of relating the model to the full theory in this way is that there is a unique\n(under weak conditions) diffeomorphism invariant representation of the full holonomy/flux\nalgebra [34] while within models one usually has several options.\nThe reduced theory is usually not a pure gauge theory even in the absence of matter since some components \u03c6 of the full connection play the role of scalar fields in the\nreduced model. Another difference to the full theory is that often the model has a reduced gauge group. States of the full theory and the model are then based on different\ngroups. Nevertheless, representations of the reduced structure group automatically occur\nwhen the reduction from full states is done. For an explicit representation of states and\noperators an Abelian gauge group is most helpful since all irreducible representations are\nthen one-dimensional and there are no complicated coupling coefficients between different\nrepresentations. In fact, a non-trivial isotropy subgroup of the symmetry group often, as in\nthe spherically symmetric case, implies an Abelian gauge group. Similarly, diagonalization\nconditions imposed on connections and triads can lead to Abelian gauge groups. On the\nother hand, a non-trivial isotropy group or additional diagonalization conditions lead to\nadditional complications since the relations (1) have to be taken care of. Moreover, even\nthough the reduced connection may be Abelian, its holonomies do in general not commute\nwith expressions (point holonomies) representing scalars since this would be incompatible\nwith a non-degenerate triad. Simplifications of an Abelian theory, such as spin network\nstates with an Abelian group, then are not always obvious.\nIn many cases, the combined system of the reduced Abelian connection plus scalar\nfields \u03c6 can be simplified taking into account the special form of a given class of invariant\n5\n\n\fconnections. A model can be formulated as essentially Abelian if connection components\nalong independent directions along B and in the orbits are perpendicular in the Lie algebra.\nFor instance, in the 1 + 1 dimensional case, a connection in general has the form\nA = Ax (x)\u039bx (x)dx + Ay (x)\u039by (x)dy + Az (x)\u039bz (x)dz + field independent terms\n\n(3)\n\nwhere x is the inhomogeneous coordinate on B and \u039bI (x) \u2208 LG. (Depending on the\nsymmetry, there can be additional terms not depending on fields AI , as happens in the\nspherically symmetric case discussed later.) The fields Ay and Az together with components\nof \u039by and \u039bz comprise the field \u03c6 determining AS/F and are thus subject to (1). Simplifications occur if we have tr(\u039bx \u039by ) = tr(\u039bx \u039bz ) = tr(\u039by \u039bz ) = 0, as happens in the spherically\nsymmetric case or for cylindrical gravitational waves with a polarization condition. Then,\nholonomies of invariant connections take a corresponding form with perpendicular internal\ndirections, and thus obey special relations that would not hold true for holonomies of an\narbitrary connection. The most important relation which will be used later is\nLemma 1 Let g := exp(A) and h := exp(B) with A, B \u2208 su(2) such that tr(AB) = 0.\nThen\ngh = hg + h\u22121 g + hg \u22121 \u2212 tr(hg) .\n(4)\nProof: Since the equation (4) is invariant under conjugation of both g and h with the\nsame SU(2)-element, we can first rotate A to equal a\u03c41 for some a \u2208 R. Then, tr(AB) = 0\nimplies that B = b2 \u03c42 + b3 \u03c43 which can be rotated to B = b\u03c42 while keeping A fixed.\nThe proof proceeds by directly computing all products involved, using exp(a\u03c4i ) =\ncos(a/2) + 2\u03c4i sin(a/2).\nThus, even though reduced holonomies do not all lie in an Abelian subgroup, they are\nalmost commuting in the sense that products of two holonomies can always be expanded\ninto terms where the order is reversed. It turns out that this is sufficient for a simplification\nof the representation of states and basic operators, and in turn of other ones like the volume\noperator. This has been exploited in homogeneous models, where the special form of\nconnections was a consequence of the non-trivial isotropy [2] or a diagonalization condition\n[5]. Similarly in 1 + 1 dimensional models, a non-trivial isotropy group or a diagonalization\ncondition can lead to connection components which are perpendicular for independent\ndirections. As we will discuss in what follows, this leads to a similar simplification in\nthe representation of states, but in inhomogeneous models there can be an additional\ncomplication for the volume operator.\n\n3\n\nClassical phase space\n\nIn the main part of this paper we are interested in spherical symmetry where S \u223c\n= SU(2) (in\ngeneral, the action on P does not project to an SO(3) action, even if it does so on \u03a3) and,\noutside symmetry centers, F \u223c\n= S 2 . The reduced (radial) manifold\n= U(1) such that S/F \u223c\n6\n\n\fB is 1-dimensional. On the orbits we have an invariant metric which can be written as\nd\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 in angular coordinates which will be used from now on. A coordinate on B\nwill be called x in what follows, but not fixed. The reduced phase space of this model has\nbeen studied in ADM variables [10] and complex Ashtekar variables [9, 11], which can be\nused for a reduced phase space or Dirac quantization. Many relations in complex Ashtekar\nvariables also apply here, but one should be cautious since our notation is slightly different\nand in some places adapted to a loop quantization. The classical model in real Ashtekar\nvariables and preliminary steps of a loop quantization have been described in [32, 33].\nAny invariant connection allowing a non-degenerate dual vector field can be written as\nA = Ax (x)\u039b3 dr + (A1 (x)\u039b1 + A2 (x)\u039b2 )d\u03b8 + (A1 (x)\u039b2 \u2212 A2 (x)\u039b1 ) sin \u03b8d\u03c6 + \u039b3 cos \u03b8d\u03c6 (5)\nwith three real functions Ax , A1 and A2 on B. The su(2)-matrices \u039bI are constant and are\nidentical to \u03c4I = \u2212 2i \u03c3I or a rigid rotation thereof. An invariant densitized triad has a dual\nform,\nE = E x (x)\u039b3 sin \u03b8\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ (E 1 (x)\u039b1 + E 2 (x)\u039b2 ) sin \u03b8\n+ (E 1 (x)\u039b2 \u2212 E 2 (x)\u039b1 )\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(6)\n\nsuch that the functions E x , E 1 and E 2 on B are canonically conjugate to Ax , A1 and A2 :\nZ\n1\ndx(dAx \u2227 dE x + 2dA1 \u2227 dE 1 + 2dA2 \u2227 dE 2 )\n(7)\n\u03a9B =\n2\u03b3G B\nwith the gravitational constant G and the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter \u03b3.\nIt will later be useful to keep in mind a peculiarity of one-dimensional models concerning\nthe density weight of fields. As in the full theory, the connection has density weight zero,\nand the densitized triad is a vector field with density weight one. But in one dimension\nthe transformation properties with fixed orientation imply that a 1-form is equivalent to a\nscalar of density weight one, while a densitized vector field is equivalent to a scalar without\ndensity weight. Under a coordinate change x 7\u2192 y(x), a densitized vector field, for instance,\ntransforms as E a = \u1ebc b \u2202xa /\u2202y b |det \u2202y/\u2202x|, which implies E x = \u1ebc x * |y \u2032(x)|/y \u2032(x) = \u00b1E x .\nThus, E x can be seen as the component of a densitized vector field on B or as a scalar, while\nE 1 and E 2 are densitized scalars (or 1-form components). Similarly, Ax is the component\nof a 1-form on B or a densitized scalar, while A1 and A2 are scalars (or densitized vector\nfield components).\nThese variables are subject to constraints which are obtained by inserting the invariant\nforms into the full expressions. We have the Gauss constraint\nZ\nG[\u03bb] =\ndx\u03bb(E x\u2032 + 2A1 E 2 \u2212 2A2 E 1 ) \u2248 0\n(8)\nB\n\ngenerating U(1)-gauge transformations, the diffeomorphism constraint\nZ\nD[Nx ] =\ndxNx (2A\u20321 E 1 + 2A\u20322 E 2 \u2212 Ax E x\u2032 )\nB\n\n7\n\n(9)\n\n\fand the Euclidean part of the Hamiltonian constraint\nZ\n\u0001\u22121/2\nH[N] = 2 dxN |E x |((E 1 )2 + (E 2 )2 )\n\n(10)\n\u0001\n\u00d7 E x (E 1 A\u20322 \u2212 E 2 A\u20321 ) + Ax E x (A1 E 1 + A2 E 2 ) + (A21 + A22 \u2212 1)((E 1 )2 + (E 2 )2 ) .\nB\n\nIn what follows it will be more convenient to work with variables that are better adapted\nto the gauge transformations. We introduce the gauge invariant quantities\np\nA\u03c6 (x) :=\nA1 (x)2 + A2 (x)2 ,\n(11)\np\nE 1 (x)2 + E 2 (x)2\n(12)\nE\u03c6 (x) :=\n\nand the internal directions\n\n\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x) := (A1 (x)\u039b2 \u2212 A2 (x)\u039b1 )/A\u03c6 (x) ,\n\u039bE\n\u03c6 (x)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n:= (E (x)\u039b2 \u2212 E (x)\u039b1 )/E (x)\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nE\nin the \u039b1 -\u039b2 plane. Furthermore, we parameterize \u039bA\n\u03c6 (x) and \u039b\u03c6 (x), which in general are\ndifferent from each other, by two angles \u03b1(x), \u03b2(x):\n\n\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x) =: \u039b1 cos \u03b2(x) + \u039b2 sin \u03b2(x) ,\n\n(15)\n\n\u039bE\n\u03c6 (x) =: \u039b1 cos (\u03b1(x) + \u03b2(x)) + \u039b2 sin (\u03b1(x) + \u03b2(x)) .\n\n(16)\n\nE\nNote that cos \u03b1 = \u039bA\n\u03c6 * \u039b\u03c6 is gauge invariant under U(1)-rotations, while the angle \u03b2 is\npure gauge.\nIn these new variables the symplectic structure becomes\nZ\n1\n\u03a9B =\ndx (dAx \u2227 dE x + 2dA\u03c6 \u2227 d(E \u03c6 cos \u03b1) + 2d\u03b2 \u2227 d(A\u03c6 E \u03c6 sin \u03b1))\n2\u03b3G B\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n=\ndx dAx \u2227 dE x + dA\u03c6 \u2227 dP \u03c6 + d\u03b2 \u2227 dP \u03b2\n(17)\n2\u03b3G B\n\nwith new momenta\n\nP \u03c6 (x) := 2E \u03c6 (x) cos \u03b1(x)\n\n(18)\n\nP \u03b2 (x) := 2A\u03c6 (x)E \u03c6 (x) sin \u03b1(x) = A\u03c6 (x)P \u03c6 (x) tan \u03b1(x)\n\n(19)\n\nconjugate to A\u03c6 and\n\nconjugate to \u03b2. The Gauss constraint then takes the form\nZ\nG[\u03bb] =\ndx\u03bb(E x\u2032 \u2212 P \u03b2 ) \u2248 0\n\n(20)\n\nB\n\nwhich is easily solved by P \u03b2 = E x\u2032 while the function Ax + \u03b2 \u2032 is manifestly gauge invariant.\n8\n\n\fUsing these variables, the situation is different from that in the full theory in that the\nmomentum conjugate to the connection component A\u03c6 is not the triad component E \u03c6 ,\nwhich together with the momentum E x would directly determine the geometry\nds2 = E x (x)\u22121 E \u03c6 (x)2 dx2 + E x (x)(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) .\n\n(21)\n\nInstead, the momentum P \u03c6 is related to E \u03c6 through the angle \u03b1. This angle is a rather\ncomplicated function of the variables, depending also on connection components: tan \u03b1 =\n(A\u03c6 P \u03c6 )\u22121 P \u03b2 . This will complicate the quantum geometry since the fluxes P will be basic\nvariables with simple quantizations, while geometric operators like the volume operator will\nbe more complicated. In homogeneous models [5, 2], on the other hand, this complication\ndoes not appear since the Gauss constraint (20) with constant E x implies P \u03b2 = 0 and thus\n\u03b1 = 0.\n\n4\n\nKinematical Hilbert space\n\nBy definition, symmetric states can be described by restricting states of the full theory to\ninvariant connections, which are of the form (5) in the spherically symmetric case (from a\ndifferent point of view, focusing on coherent states, spherical symmetry has been considered\nin [35]). Using all states in the full theory this leads to a complete, but not independent\nset of symmetric states, which then must be functionals of Ax (x), A1 (x) and A2 (x). That\nsuch functionals have to be expected is also obvious from the reduced point of view where\none just quantizes the classically reduced phase space. However, the class of functions\nobtained in this way depends on the quantization procedure, a loop quantization giving\ndifferent results than, e.g., a Wheeler\u2013DeWitt like quantization (as happens already in the\nisotropic case where both quantizations result in inequivalent representations [27]).\nWe first follow a reduced quantization point of view analogous to that followed in [27].\nIn constructing the quantum theory we perform the steps of the full loop quantization,\nthus obtaining a loop quantization of the reduced model. Thereafter we will reduce states\nfrom the full theory and implement the reduction there, leading to the same results in\nparticular for basic operators.\n\n4.1\n\nReduced quantization\n\nWe start by choosing elementary functions on the classical phase space that will be promoted to basic operators of the quantum theory, acting on a suitable Hilbert space. The\nhallmark of loop quantizations is that those basic quantities are chosen to be holonomies\nof the connection and fluxes of the densitized triad. This choice incorporates a smearing of\nthe classical fields along lines and surfaces, which is necessary for a well-defined representation, and does so in a background independent manner. From the reduced point of view,\nA\u03c6 is a scalar for which there are analogous techniques [31, 30] which we will use below.\n\n9\n\n\f4.1.1\n\nCylindrical states\n\nA loop quantization in the connection representation is based on cylindrical functions which\ndepend on the connection only via holonomies. If we just consider the space AB of reduced\nU(1)-connections given by Ax (x) on B, cylindrical functions are continuous functions on\nthe space of generalized connections \u0100B . As in the full theory, \u0100B can be written as a\nprojective limit over graphs in B, which in the 1-dimensional\ncase are simply characterized\n\u1e60\nby a disjoint union of non-overlapping edges, g = i ei , whose vertex set V (g) is the union\nof all endpoints of the ei . Choosing an orientation of B, we fix the orientation of all\nedges to be compatible with that of B. Holonomies then define spaces AgB of maps from\nthe set of edges of a given graph of n edges Rto SU(2)n , which for classical connections\nreduces to AB : g \u2192 U(1), e 7\u2192 h(e) := exp 21 i e Ax (x) (the factor 1/2 comes from taking\nmatrix elements of \u039b3 -holonomies). The space of generalized connections is obtained as\nthe projective limit\n\u0100B = limg\u2282B AgB\n(22)\n\u2190\u2212\nwith the usual projections pgg\u2032 (\u0100gB ) := \u0100gB |g\u2032 for g \u2032 \u2282 g.\nSince A\u03c6 transforms as a scalar, its holonomies with respect to edges in B would not\nbe well-defined. Instead, following [30, 31] one considers \"point holonomies\" exp(i\u03bcA\u03c6 (x))\nsuch that, for a fixed point x \u2208 B, the relevant space of states is the space C(R\u0304Bohr )\nof continuous (almost periodic) functions on the Bohr compactification of the real line\nR \u220b A\u03c6 (x). The remaining independent scalar function in the connection, \u03b2(x), takes\nvalues in the circle S 1 which is already compact. Corresponding point holonomies are\nsimply exponentials exp(i\u03b2(x)) \u2208 U(1).\nSince all points are independent, the space of generalized fields \u0100S 2 is again a projective\nlimit, this time over sets of points {xi }i=1...m \u2282 B, which can be taken as the vertex set\nV (g) of a graph g. For a fixed graph, we obtain the space AgS 2 of maps from the set V (g) of\nm vertices to (R\u0304Bohr \u00d7 U(1))m , which for classical fields is AS 2 : V (g) \u2192 R\u0304Bohr \u00d7 U(1), v 7\u2192\n(A\u03c6 (v), ei\u03b2(v) ). The space of generalized fields is\n\u0100S 2 = limg\u2282B AgS 2\n\u2190\u2212\nwhich can easily be combined with \u0100B to obtain the space of generalized spherically symmetric connections\n\u0100B\u00d7S 2 = limg\u2282B AgB \u2297 AgS 2 .\n(23)\n\u2190\u2212\nSince \u0100B\u00d7S 2 is the projective limit of tensor products of compact groups, U(1) and\nR\u0304Bohr , it carries a normalized Haar measure which is analogous to the Ashtekar\u2013Lewandowski\nmeasure in the full theory and will be called \u03bc0 . The kinematical Hilbert space is then\nobtained by completing the space of cylindrical functions on \u0100B\u00d7S 2 with respect to \u03bc0 .\nHolonomies defined above act by multiplication on this space.\nAs in the full theory, one can use spin network states as a convenient basis, which in the\nconnection representation become functionals of Ax , A\u03c6 and \u03b2. They are cylindrical states\nbased on a given graph g whose edges e are labeled by irreducible U(1)-representations\n10\n\n\fke \u2208 Z, and whose vertices v are labeled by irreducible R\u0304Bohr -representations \u03bcv \u2208 R as\nwell as irreducible S 1 -representation kv \u2208 Z. The value of such a spin network state in a\ngiven (generalized) spherically symmetric connection A then is\nY\nY\nTg,k,\u03bc (A) =\nke (h(e) )\n\u03bcv (A\u03c6 (v))kv (\u03b2(v))\ne\u2208g\n\n=\n\nY\ne\u2208g\n\nv\u2208V (g)\n\nexp\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nik\n2 e\n\n\u0013 Y\n\u222b Ax (x)dx\nexp(i\u03bcv A\u03c6 (v)) exp(ikv \u03b2(v)) .\ne\n\n(24)\n\nv\u2208V (g)\n\nSince A\u03c6 and \u03b2 are scalars on B, they are not integrated over in the states. On the\nother hand, Ax as a connection component is integrated to appear only via holonomies.\nAlternatively, as discussed before, we can view the one-dimensional connection component\nAx as a density-valued scalar. Also from this perspective it would have to appear integrated\nalong regions in the above form. Since A\u03c6 is by definition non-negative, we will restrict\nthe states to only those values.\n4.1.2\n\nFlux operators\n\nFor the flux of E x it is also helpful to view it in the unconventional way as a scalar. At a\ngiven point x, E x (x) will then simply be quantized to a single derivative operator without\nintegration:\n\u03b3l2P X \u2202f \u03b4h(e)\n\u03b3l2P 1 X (e) \u2202f\n\u00ca (x)f (h) = \u2212i\nh\n=\n*\n4\u03c0 e \u2202h(e) \u03b4Ax (x)\n8\u03c0 2 e\u220bx\n\u2202h(e)\nx\n\n(25)\n\nR\nwhere f is a cylindrical function depending on the holonomies h(e) = exp( 12 i e Ax dx). To\nsimplify the notation we assumed that x lies only at boundary points of edges, which can\nalways be achieved by subdivision, and which contributes the additional 12 . The other flux\ncomponents, P \u03c6 and P \u03b2 , are density valued scalars and thus will be turned to well-defined\noperators after integrating over regions I \u2282 B. We obtain\nZ\nZ\nZ\nX \u2202f \u03b4h(v)\n\u03b3l2P\n\u03b4\n\u03b3l2P\n\u03c6\ndx\nP\u0302 f (h) = \u2212i\ndxf (h) = \u2212i\n4\u03c0 I \u03b4A\u03c6 (x)\n4\u03c0 I\n\u2202h(v) \u03b4A\u03c6 (x)\nI\nv\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2202f\n\u03b3l2 X\n\u03b3l2P X\ndx (v) \u03b4(v, x) = \u2212i P\nf (h)\n(26)\n= \u2212i\n4\u03c0 v I \u2202h\n4\u03c0 v\u2208I \u2202A\u03c6 (v)\nwith h(v) := A\u03c6 (v), and similarly\nZ\n\u03b3l2 X \u2202\nf (h) .\nP\u0302 \u03b2 f (h) = \u2212i P\n4\u03c0 v\u2208I \u2202\u03b2(v)\nI\n\n11\n\n(27)\n\n\fActing on spin network states (24), we obtain\n\u03b3l2P ke+ (x) + ke\u2212 (x)\nTg,k,\u03bc\n\u00ca x (x)Tg,k,\u03bc =\n8\u03c0\n2\nZ\n\u03b3l2P X\n\u03bcv Tg,k,\u03bc\nP\u0302 \u03c6 Tg,k,\u03bc =\n4\u03c0 v\u2208I\nI\nZ\n\u03b3l2P X\n\u03b2\nP\u0302 Tg,k,\u03bc =\nkv Tg,k,\u03bc\n4\u03c0 v\u2208I\nI\n\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n\nwhere e\u00b1 (x) are the two edges (or two parts of a single edge) meeting in x. Thus, spin\nnetworks are eigenstates of all flux operators and allR flux operators have discrete spectra\n(normalizable eigenstates). Note in particular that I P\u0302 \u03c6 is self-adjoint even though the\nrange of A\u03c6 is restricted to non-negative values. In a Schr\u00f6dinger representation the corresponding derivative operator would not have a self-adjoint extension, which is the case\nhere on the restricted Bohr Hilbert space.\nKnowing the flux operators allows us to quantize and solve the Gauss constraint (20).\nRestricting attention for simplicity to piecewise constantR \u03bb, it suffices to quantize the\nx\nintegrated density E x\u2032 , which can be done easily by using x\u2212+ E x\u2032 dx = E x (x+ ) \u2212 E x (x\u2212 ).\nThus,\n\u03b3l2P X\n\u011c[\u03bb]Tg,k,\u03bc =\n\u03bb(v)(ke+ (v) \u2212 ke\u2212 (v) \u2212 2kv )Tg,k,\u03bc = 0\n(31)\n8\u03c0 v\nwhich is solved by\n\nkv = 21 (ke+ (v) \u2212 ke\u2212 (v) )\n\n(32)\n\nfor all vertices v of a given spin network. Since the kv must be integer, all differences ke+ (v) \u2212\nke\u2212 (v) must be even, restricting the allowed values. The labels kv are then determined\ncompletely by the edge labels ke and can be dropped while the other vertex labels, \u03bcv , are\nnot restricted by the Gauss constraint. In fact, when (32) is satisfied, the spin network\n(24) takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013Y\nY\n\u2032\n1\nTg,k,\u03bc =\nexp 2 ike \u222b (Ax + \u03b2 )dx\nexp(i\u03bcv A\u03c6(v) )\n(33)\ne\n\ne\n\nv\n\nwhich depends only on manifestly gauge invariant quantities.\nThe diffeomorphism constraint only generates transformations along B, which can be\ndealt with by group averaging in complete analogy to the full theory (see also [32, 33] for\nmore details).\n\n4.2\n\nSpherically symmetric states from the full theory\n\nSince symmetric states are by definition full states supported on invariant connections,\none can, for a given symmetry action, find the form of symmetric states by restricting\na complete set of full states. In a second step, one can than select an independent set\n12\n\n\fof the resulting functions on \u0100B\u00d7S 2 and orthonormalize it in the Haar measure. Gauge\ntransformations in the symmetric context are usually more restricted than those in the full\ntheory; for instance along homogeneous directions gauge transformations are required to\nbe constant in order to preserve the form of invariant connections like (5). Therefore, one\ncan and should also consider certain gauge non-invariant states in the full theory in order\nto access all possible (gauge invariant) states in the model.\n4.2.1\n\nStates\n\nWe start with spin network states in the full theory which for simplicity will be assumed to\nbe based on graphs made of only radial edges, i.e. submanifolds of B \u00d7 {p} where p \u2208 S 2\nis fixed, or edges lying in orbits of the rotation group. In the latter case we assume that\nthe edge is composed of edges along great circles in the \u03b8-direction or at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 (the\nlast restriction allows us to ignore the field independent term in the connection which\ncorresponds to a component of the spin connection). Note that the composition of orbital\nedges does not need to be a closed edge, which still corresponds to a gauge invariant\nstate from the reduced point of view. For orbital edges we use the angular coordinates\nas parameters, while there is no preferred parameterization for radial edges. Furthermore,\nafter fixing an orientation of the radial manifold B we choose all radial edges to be oriented\nin the same way as B. The set of states based on those graphs is certainly not complete in\nthe full theory, but it will be sufficient for the spherically symmetric sector. In particular,\nthose states suffice to separate spherically symmetric connections. At this point states are\nnot simplified much since vertices can still have arbitrary valence.\nLet us thus fix such a state, based on a certain graph of the above form. Its reduction is\nperformed by inserting holonomies obtained from (5). We then need only two parameters\nfor each orbital edge, the coordinate length \u03bc of the edge and the position x of the orbit\nalong B. This leads to holonomies\nZ\nZ\nZ\ne\n1\n1\nhx (A) = exp Ax (x)dx\u039b3 = cos 2 Ax (x)dx + 2\u039b3 sin 2 Ax (x)dx\n(34)\n(x,\u03bc\u03b8 )\n\nh\u03b8\n\ne\n\u03bc\u03b8\n\ne\n\ne\n\nA\n1\n1\n(A) = exp \u222b A\u03c6 (x)d\u03b8\u039bA\n\u03b8 (x) = cos 2 \u03bc\u03b8 A\u03c6 (x) + 2\u039b\u03b8 (x) sin 2 \u03bc\u03b8 A\u03c6 (x)\n0\n1\n\u03bc A (x)\n2 \u03b8 \u03c6\n\u0012 \u03bc\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c0\u039b3 /2\n+ 2e\u2212\u03c0\u039b3 /2 \u039bA\nsin 21 \u03bc\u03b8 A\u03c6 (x)\n(35)\n\u03c6 (x)e\n\u0013\n1\n= cos 12 \u03bc\u03c6 A\u03c6 (x) \u2212 2\u039bA\nh\u03c6(x,\u03bc\u03c6 ) (A) = exp \u2212 \u222b d\u03c6A\u03c6 (x)\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x)\n\u03c6 (x) sin 2 \u03bc\u03c6 A\u03c6 (x)(36)\n\n= cos\n\n0\n\nwhere path orderings are not necessary since \u039b3 is constant along B, and the \u039bA (x) are\nconstant along paths on orbits.\nThe parameters \u03bc\u03b8 and \u03bc\u03c6 are simply the parameter lengths of the orbital edges in the\n\u03b8- and \u03c6-directions. They can take any real value since we do not require that individual\norbital edges run around great circles once, but can also run through just part of a great\ncircle, or also through the same great circle several times in both directions.\nInserting these holonomies is most easily done for an alternative form of the states\nrather than the spin network basis. All states can be obtained (in an overcomplete way) as\n13\n\n\fproducts of Wilson loops which in our case are composed of radial or orbital holonomies.\n(If B has a boundary, there can be open ends of the loop where gauge transformations are\nfrozen.) Each such state is a superposition of matrix elements of the form\n(v1 ,\u03bc1\u03b8,1 ) (v1 ,\u03bc1\u03c6,1 )\nh\u03c6\n\nhx(e1 ) * h\u03b8\n\n(v2 ,\u03bc2\u03b8,1 ) (v2 ,\u03bc2\u03c6,1 )\nh\u03c6\n\n*hx(e2 ) * h\u03b8\n*hx(e3 ) * * *\n\n(v1 ,\u03bc1\u03b8,n ) (v1 ,\u03bc1\u03c6,n )\n1\n1\nh\u03c6\n\n* * * h\u03b8\n\n(v2 ,\u03bc2\u03b8,n ) (v2 ,\u03bc2\u03c6,n )\n2\n2\nh\u03c6\n\n* * * h\u03b8\n\nwith radial edges e1 , e2 , e3 , . . . , and vertices v1 , v2 , . . . , where v1 is the endpoint of e1 and\nthe starting point of e2 . (A given edge e can appear several times in such an expression\nsince it can be traversed back and forth with running through orbital edges in between.)\nThe parameters \u03bci\u03b8/\u03c6,j are the parameter lengths of orbital edges and can take any real\nvalue.\nTo simplify the general expressions evaluated in spherically symmetric connections we\nassume that the states are gauge invariant under gauge transformations around \u039b3 , constant on the orbits (which still allows also open graphs). We can then gauge the angle \u03b2(x)\nto be constant (with a local gauge transformation exp(\u2212\u03b2(x)\u039b3 ), possibly up to a global\ngauge transformation if there is a boundary). Then also \u039bA\n\u03c6 is constant and we can apply\nLemma 1 to (almost) commute the holonomies. In particular, we can order the radial\nholonomies according to coordinate values x of their starting points, also re-orienting them\nif necessary such that they run in the positive orientation of B. Between different edges\nthere are vertices which can have the following forms:\n\u2212 ) k\u2212\n+ ) k+\n* * * (h(e\n) * h\u03c6(v,\u03bc) * (h(e\n) *** ,\nx\nx\n\u2212 ) k\u2212\n+ ) k+\n* * * (h(e\n) \u039b3 * h\u03c6(v,\u03bc) * (h(e\n) ***\nx\nx\n\u2212 ) k\u2212\n)\n* * * (h(e\nx\n\n*\n\nh\u03c6(v,\u03bc)\n\n*\n\n+ ) k+\n)\n\u039b3 (h(e\nx\n\n***\n\nor\n(37)\n\nwhere possible factors of \u039b3 come from exp( 12 \u03c0\u039b3 ) in \u03b8-holonomies (35).\nMatrix elements of the resulting products of holonomies can easily be seen to be superpositions of states of the form (33), keeping in mind that we chose the gauge such that\n\u03b2 is constant along B. It is also possible, though more tedious, to follow this procedure\nwithout fixing the gauge. We just mention the example of a single \"rectangular\" loop made\nof one radial edge with holonomy hx and two orbital ones along the equator at x\u00b1 with\nholonomies h\u00b1 . The corresponding Wilson loop is\n\u0001\n\u22121\n1\ntr(hx h+ h\u22121\ncos 12 \u222b Ax + 2\u039b3 sin 21 \u222b Ax (cos 12 A\u03c6 (x+ ) + 2\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x+ ) sin 2 A\u03c6 (x+ ))\nx h\u2212 ) = tr\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\ncos 21 \u222b Ax \u2212 2\u039b3 sin 21 \u222b Ax (cos 21 A\u03c6 (x\u2212 ) \u2212 2\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x\u2212 ) sin 2 A\u03c6 (x\u2212 ))\n= 2 cos 21 A\u03c6 (x+ ) cos 12 A\u03c6 (x\u2212 )\n(38)\n+2 cos (\u222b Ax + \u03b2(x+ ) \u2212 \u03b2(x\u2212 )) sin 21 A\u03c6 (x+ ) sin 12 A\u03c6 (x\u2212 )\n1\nA\nA\nA\nwhere we used tr(\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x+ )\u039b\u03c6 (x\u2212 )) = \u2212 2 cos(\u03b2(x+ ) \u2212 \u03b2(x\u2212 )) and tr(\u039b3 \u039b\u03c6 (x+ )\u039b\u03c6 (x\u2212 )) =\n1\nsin(\u03b2(x+ ) \u2212 \u03b2(x\u2212 )). This state can clearly be written as a superposition of states (33).\n4\n\n14\n\n\fThus, the states obtained before from a loop quantization of the classically reduced\nphase space also emerge as symmetric states in the full theory. This is true, however, only\nwith a slight restriction since full gauge invariant spin network states evaluated in spherically symmetric connections satisfy an additional condition: the gauge transformation\nexp( 12 \u03c0\u039b3 ) changes the sign of A1 and A2 everywhere, which means that all those states\nwill be even under changing the sign of all A\u03c6 (x), as e.g. (38). This can easily be imposed\nas an additional condition on the reduced states, and it will be respected by operators\ncoming from full ones.\n4.2.2\n\nFlux operators\n\nIn general, the dual action of operators of the full theory applied to distributional symmetric\nstates will not lead to another symmetric state. The reason is that symmetric states\nonly incorporate the condition for the connection to be invariant, but if full operators\nare used there is no condition for an invariant triad. In such a case, even classically\nthe Hamiltonian flow generated by an arbitrary function on the phase space would in\ngeneral leave the subspace of invariant connections with arbitrary triads (while the flow\nwould always stay inside the subspace of invariant connections and invariant triads if the\nsymmetric model is well-defined). There are, however, notable exceptions which allow us\nto obtain all operators for the basic variables directly from the full theory. This is true\nfor holonomies of Ax and A\u03c6 which commute with connections, anyway. But we can also\nfind special fluxes whose classical expressions generate a flow that stays in the subspace\nof invariant connections.\nFor instance, for the \u039b3 -component of a full flux for a symmetry\nR\norbit S 2 , FS32 (x) := S 2 \u039b3 * (E(x)ydx)d2 y, we have\nZ\ni x\ni\n3\n\u03b4(x, y)d2y\n{Aa (x), FS 2 }|Ainv \u00d7E = \u03b3\u03ba\u039b3 \u03b4a\nS2\n\nwhich defines a distributional vector field on the phase space parallel to the subspace\nAinv \u00d7 E of invariant connections (parallel to Ax ). If we would look at any other internal\ncomponent, e.g., FS22 using \u039b2 , on the other hand, the Poisson bracket would be proportional to \u039bi2 \u03b4ax , which is not parallel to the subspace of invariant connections. Similarly,\none can see that the flux\nZ\n\u0001\nA\nFI\u00d7S 1 :=\n\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x) * (E(x)yd\u03c6)dxd\u03b8 + \u039b\u03b8 (x) * (E(x)yd\u03b8)dxd\u03c6\nI\u00d7S 1\n\nfor a cylindrical surface along an interval I \u2282 B generates a flow parallel to A\u03c6 , which\nleaves the space of invariant connections invariant.\nThese two fluxes are sufficient for the basic momenta since\nZ\n\u039b3 * (E(x)ydx)d2 y = 4\u03c0E x (x)\nS2\n\nand\n\nZ\n\nI\u00d7S 1\n\n\u039bA\n\u03c6 (x)\n\n* (E(x)yd\u03c6)dxd\u03b8 +\n\n\u039bA\n\u03b8 (x)\n15\n\n\u0001\n\n* (E(x)yd\u03b8)dxd\u03c6 = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nI\n\nP \u03c6 (x)dx\n\n\fwhose quantizations can thus be obtained directly from the full theory. Note that this\nwould not be possible for E \u03c6 , for instance, since its corresponding flux would generate\na transformation changing the invariant form of A (since any full expression reducing\nto E \u03c6 upon reduction would involve the non-linear function \u039b\u03c6E depending on the triad\ncomponents).\nFor the flow FS32 (x) we obtain the \u039b3 -component of an invariant vector field associated\nwith the edges containing x. The pull back to invariant connections in (2) ensures that\nthe dual action on the distribution \u03a8 can be expressed by an invariant vector field on\n(e)\nthe representation \u03c8 where only radial holonomies hx of the form (34) appear. For the\nexplicit expression we again assume that x is an endpoint of two edges, e+ (x) and e\u2212 (x)\nwhich can be achieved by appropriate subdivision, and obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(e+ (x)) T\n2\n(e\u2212 (x)) T\n3\n1\n)\n+ tr(\u039b3 hx\n)\n.\n(39)\nF\u0302S 2 (x) = 2 i\u03b3lP tr(\u039b3 hx\n(e+ (x))\n(e\u2212 (x))\n\u2202hx\n\u2202hx\n(e)\n\nSince \u039b3 commutes with radial holonomies hx , we do not need to distinguish between left\nand right invariant vector field operators. According to the derivation of states above, they\ncan be seen as polynomials in the radial holonomies. The action of a derivative operator\n(e)\n(e)\n(e)\n(e)\n(e)\ntr(\u039b3 hx )T \u2202/\u2202hx with respect to hx then amounts to replacing (hx )k by k\u039b3 (hx )k and\n(e)\n(e)\n\u039b3 (hx )k by \u2212 14 k(hx )k (note that insertions of \u039b3 appear automatically as in (37); in\nany case, they would occur when considering a more general class of gauge non-invariant\nstates in the full theory which are invariant from the reduced point of view). Eigenstates\nof the derivative can then be obtained by forming linear combinations such that only the\n(e)\n(e)\n(e)\n(e)\ncombinations (hx )k \u00b12i\u039b3 (hx )k appear, which are mapped to \u2213 12 ik((hx )k \u00b12i\u039b3 (hx )k ).\nIn this way, one obtains eigenstates of \u00ca x (x) = (4\u03c0)\u22121 F\u0302S32 (x) and a spectrum identical to\n(28).\nThe operator \u00ca x also appears in the Gauss constraint. A gauge invariant state in the\n(e+ (x))\n(e\u2212 (x))\n(x)\n(x)\nfull theory in particular satisfies \u039b3 * (JL (hx\n) \u2212 JR (hx\n) + JL (h\u03c6 ) \u2212 JR (h\u03c6 )) = 0\nin any vertex x where we can assume the form (37) for the spin network (a general vertex\n(e\u00b1 (x))\nwould just be a superposition of those vertices). The operators \u039b3 * J(hx\n) simply give\noperators \u00ca x where we do not need to distinguish between right and left invariant ones,\nwhile for the derivative operators with respect to \u03c6-holonomies we have\n!\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(x)\n(x)\nT\nT\n\u039b3 * (JL (h(x)\n\u2212 tr(\u039b3 h(x)\n\u03c6 ) \u2212 JR (h\u03c6 )) = \u2212i tr(h\u03c6 \u039b3 )\n\u03c6 )\n(x)\n(x)\n\u2202h\u03c6\n\u2202h\u03c6\nT\n= i tr[\u039b3 , h(x)\n\u03c6 ]\n\n= i\n(x)\n\n\u2202\n(x)\n\n\u2202h\u03c6\n\n(x)\n\n= i tr\n\n\u2202\n\u2202h\u03c6\n\u2202\u03b2(x) \u2202h(x)\n\u03c6\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b2(x)\n\n(x)\n\nusing [\u039b3 , h\u03c6 ] = \u2202h\u03c6 /\u2202\u03b2(x) with \u039bA\n\u03c6 (x) = cos \u03b2(x)\u039b1 + sin \u03b2(x)\u039b2 . The right hand side\n\u03b2\nis then simply proportional to P\u0302 (x) and we see that the \u039b3 -component of the full quantum\n16\n\n\fGauss constraint is identical to the reduced Gauss constraint. (The remaining components\nof the full Gauss constraint would not fix the space of symmetric states and thus cannot\nbe dealt with in this way. They would have to be satisfied identically.) In what follows we\nuse the above equation to define the operator P\u0302 \u03b2 which then has the spectrum (30) as in\nthe reduced case.\nIt remains to look at the full quantization of\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nA\n\u03c6\n\u039bA\nP dx =\n\u03c6 * (Eyd\u03c6)dxd\u03b8 + \u039b\u03b8 * (Eyd\u03b8)dxd\u03c6\n4\u03c0 I\u00d7S 1\nI\n\nacting on symmetric states. Since they are now \u039bA\n\u03c6 -components of derivative operators\nwith respect to h\u03c6 , the end result is again a simple derivative operator acting on powers\nh\u03bc\u03c6 , which gives a spectrum proportional to that in (29). It is only proportional since we\nchose the surface for this flux using the great circle S 1 , which contributes a factor 2\u03c0.\nChoosing other circles on the orbits would change the factor which, anyway, can always be\nabsorbed by a unitary transformation. (Such a rescaling is unitary for this operator, as in\nthe isotropic case [27], since the range of eigenvalues \u03bc is the real line.)\n\n4.3\n\nReduced states from the full point of view\n\nThe derivations presented above demonstrate that the states obtained from the purely\nreduced point of view are also necessary in this form when viewing them as being obtained\nby restricting full states. Also basic flux operators obtained in the reduced quantization\nand from the full theory via the dual action on distributional symmetric states agree. Thus,\nthe model can be seen as a symmetric sector of the full theory, associated with a subspace\nof the distribution space Cyl\u2217 .\nFull symmetric states which satisfy the 3-component of the full Gauss constraint are also\ngauge invariant from the reduced point of view. In fact, we can directly take the dual action\nof the 3-component of the Gauss constraint to obtain the reduced constraint (the other\ncomponents do not map the space of symmetric states to itself). In the reduced model, this\nhas as a consequence that the difference of labels associated with neighboring radial edges\nhas to be even. The analog in the full theory can be seen by considering vertices where\nradial and orbital edges meet. After inserting invariant connections, a state with such a\nvertex is equivalent to a superposition of states with a vertex having one incoming radial\nedge, a composition of several orbital edges, and an outgoing radial edge. From this point\nof view, this gauge invariant vertex is a 2(n+1)-vertex with the ingoing and outgoing radial\nedges with representations j\u2212 and j+ , respectively, as well as n closed orbital edges which\neach contribute one incoming and one outgoing part with spin ji .N\nFor an intertwiner\nL we can\nn\nfirst construct the tensor product of the orbital representations, i=1 ji \u2297 ji = i li where\nonly integer li occur in the decomposition. The vertex intertwiner maps this representation\nto the tensor product j+ \u2297 j\u2212 , which for integer li is possible in a non-trivial way only if\nj+ and j\u2212 are either both integer or both 1/2 times an integer. Thus, j+ \u2212 j\u2212 \u2208 Z, which\nis equivalent to the fact that the difference of charges k+ \u2212 k\u2212 must be even.\n17\n\n\fSimilarly, the reduced diffeomorphism constraint can be obtained directly from the\ndual action of the full diffeomorphism constraint for a radial shift vector. For other shifts,\nthe dual action would not fix the space of symmetric states. For a radial shift, then, the\nconstraint generates transformations which move vertices along the radial manifold, which\nis the same as the action generated by the reduced diffeomorphism constraint. Thus, also\nthe reduced diffeomorphism constraint can be obtained via the dual action on symmetric\nstates which leads to the same results as quantizing the classically reduced constraint. The\nHamiltonian constraint, on the other hand, is non-linear in the triads such that its dual\naction cannot be used.\nWe thus have seen how states and basic operators of the reduced model can be obtained\nfrom the full theory. Composite operators can then be built from the basic ones within\nthe model. An analogous derivation of composite reduced operators from those in the full\ntheory is more complicated since a direct application of the dual action would not fix the\nspace of symmetric states.\nIt follows from these considerations that the representation of the reduced model is\ndetermined by that of the full theory. Since the diffeomorphism covariant holonomy/flux\nrepresentation of full loop quantum gravity is unique under certain weak conditions [34],\na representation for the model is selected naturally. Starting from the classically reduced\nmodel, on the other hand, would have left open the choice of representation. In such a\ncase, the representation is usually selected in such a way that explicit calculations are\npossible, which does not say anything about physical correctness. Even working in the\nframework of this paper and using the same variables, there would be other possibilities.\nFor instance, viewing the scalar density P \u03c6 as a 1-form, which in one dimension has the\nsame transformation properties if the orientation is preserved, suggests to quantize it via\nholonomies. In this case, A\u03c6 rather than P \u03c6 would become discrete. Similarly, we could use\npoint holonomies for the densitized vector field component E x , which can also be viewed\nas a scalar. This would give a discrete Ax . All these alternatives are possible only in the\nreduced model due to the special behavior under coordinate transformations. But they are\nnot possible in the full theory and thus cannot be obtained when the link between the model\nand the full quantization is taken into account. Studying these representations further can\nshed light on physical properties and effects that are unique to the loop representation of\nthe full theory.\n\n4.4\n\nSemiclassical geometry\n\nThe flux eigenvalues allow us to find conditions for states which would be expected in\nregimes where the spatial geometry is almost classical. Comparing (21) with the Schwarzschild\nsolution at large radius, or general asymptotic conditions, shows that E x (corresponding to\nr 2 for Schwarzschild) should be large together with E x\u2032 = P \u03b2 . This implies that the edge\nlabels ke and the differences ke+ (v) \u2212 ke\u2212 (v) = 2kv have to be large compared to one since\neigenvalues of \u00ca x and P\u0302 \u03b2 are directly given by the labels without summing over vertices.\nThis is analogous to the homogeneous case where for a semiclassical geometry all labels\nhave to be large.\n18\n\n\fThe situation is different for the other triad component. From the metric we see that\nalso E \u03c6 has to be large which, for generic \u03b1 implies that P \u03c6 must be large. However, the\nquantization of the density P \u03c6 is well-defined only if it is first integrated over\nP an interval\nin B, which means that the relevant eigenvalues are given by a vertex sum v \u03bcv , which\nneeds to be large. This can be realized by large individual \u03bcv , or by a dense distribution\nof vertices such that many small \u03bcv add up to a large value. This situation is analogous\nto that in the full theory where geometric operators are always given by vertex sums. It is\nthen expected that states with many small labels are relevant for a semiclassical geometry\nsince they dominate the counting of states.\nAt this point, the difference between P \u03c6 and E \u03c6 suggests possible consequences for\nsemiclassical physics. If we fix a \u03bc\u03c6 (which happens, e.g., if we consider the dynamics\n[27]) and restrict the operators to a separable subspace of our Hilbert space generated\n\u03c6 A\u03c6\nby ei\u03bcP\n, we would\nP have a discrete set \u03bc\u03c6 n of eigenvalues with integer n. Then, the\nsum v \u03bcv = \u03bc\u03c6 v nv would still be of the same form and not become denser at large\neigenvalues (as would happen in the full theory for, e.g., the area operator). The triad\ncomponent E \u03c6 , which appears in the metric (21), however, is a more complicated function\nof the basic variables and thus is likely to have a more complicated vertex contribution\nleading to crowded eigenvalues [25].\n\n5\n\nOther 1 + 1 models\n\nThere are many other models in 1 + 1 dimensions which have infinitely many physical\ndegrees of freedom, but are integrable [12, 36], and which would be interesting to compare\nwith a loop quantization. The general form of an invariant connection in those cases is\n(3) where the \u039bI (x) \u2208 su(2), tr(\u039bI (x)2 ) = \u2212 12 can be restricted further depending on the\nsymmetry action. In general, however, they do not satisfy tr(\u039bI \u039bJ ) = \u2212 21 \u03b4IJ , which was\nthe case in the spherically symmetric model with its non-trivial isotropy group and was\nresponsible for the simplified structure of states and basic operators.\nIn cylindrically symmetric models with a space manifold \u03a3 = R\u00d7(S 1 \u00d7R), for instance,\nthe symmetry group S = S 1 \u00d7 R acts freely, and invariant connections and triads have the\nform\nA = Ax (x)\u039b3 dx + (A1 (x)\u039b1 + A2 (x)\u039b2 )dz + (A3 (x)\u039b1 + A4 (x)\u039b2 )d\u03c6\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ (E 1 (x)\u039b1 + E 2 (x)\u039b2 ) + (E 3 (x)\u039b1 + E 4 (x)\u039b2 )\nE = E x (x)\u039b3\n\u2202x\n\u2202z\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nsuch that tr(\u039b3 \u039bz ) = 0 = tr(\u039b3 \u039b\u03c6 ), but in general tr(\u039bz \u039b\u03c6 ) 6= 0.\nThe corresponding metric is\nds2 = (E x )\u22121 (E 1 E 4 \u2212 E 2 E 3 )dx2 + E x (E 1 E 4 \u2212 E 2 E 3 )\u22121 ((E 3 )2 + (E 4 )2 )dz 2\n\u0001\n\u2212 (E 2 E 4 + E 1 E 3 )dzd\u03c6 + ((E 1 )2 + (E 2 )2 )d\u03c62\n(42)\n\nwhich is not diagonal. To simplify the model further one often requires that the metric is\ndiagonal, which physically corresponds to selecting a particular polarization of Einstein\u2013\n19\n\n\fRosen waves. This is achieved by imposing the additional condition E 2 E 4 + E 1 E 3 = 0\nwhich, in order to yield a non-degenerate symplectic structure, has to be accompanied by\nA2 A4 + A1 A3 = 0 for the connection components. Thus, polarized cylindrical waves of this\nform also have perpendicular internal directions since now tr(\u039bz \u039b\u03c6 ) = 0 for both A and\nE, and similar simplifications as in the spherically symmetric case can be expected.\nThe form of the metric now is\n\u0001\nds2 = (E x )\u22121 E z E \u03c6 dx2 + E x E \u03c6 /E z dz 2 + E z /E \u03c6 d\u03c62\n(43)\nwith\n\nE z :=\n\np\n(E 1 )2 + (E 2 )2\n\n,\n\nE \u03c6 :=\n\np\n\n(E 3 )2 + (E 4 )2 .\n\n(44)\n\nEinstein\u2013Rosen waves are usually represented in the form\nds2 = e2(\u03b3\u2212\u03c8) dr 2 + e2\u03c8 dz 2 + e\u22122\u03c8 r 2 d\u03c62\n\n(45)\n\nwith only two free functions \u03b3 and \u03c8. Thus, compared with (43) one function has been\neliminated by gauge fixing the diffeomorphism constraint.\nIn fact, this form can be obtained from the more general (43) by a field-dependent\ncoordinate change [37]: The symmetry reduction leads to a space-time metric ds2 =\ne\u039b dUdV + W (e\u2212\u03a8 dx2 + e\u03a8 dy 2 ) which indeed has a spatial part as in (43) with three independent functions \u039b, W = E x and \u03a8 = log(E \u03c6 /E z ). One then introduces t := 21 (V \u2212 U)\nand \u03c1 := 12 (V + U) such that ds2 = e\u039b (\u2212dt2 + d\u03c12 ) + \u03c1(e\u2212\u03a8 dx2 + e\u03a8 dy 2 ). Finally, defining\n\u039b = 2(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c8), e\u22122\u03c8 \u03c1 := e\u2212\u03a8 and renaming x =: \u03c6, y =: z leads to the metric (45). Einstein's field equations then imply that \u03c8 behaves as a free scalar on a flat space-time, which\ncan be quantized with standard Fock techniques [12]. However, to arrive at this form of\nthe metric, several coordinate transformations have been performed which mix coordinates\nwith the physical fields. This potentially eliminates any contact the model may have with\na full theory and indicates that results may be very particular to this kind of model. From\nthe point of view taken here, where the quantum representation comes directly from the\nfull theory, a subsequent transformation in such a way is impossible, which also means\nthat the quantization of the model will be more complicated. We will see soon that the\ntransversal geometry given by (43) becomes discrete after loop quantizing, which \u03c8 when\ntreated as an ordinary scalar will not be. Thus, the quantum geometries obtained from\nboth representations differ from each other, which can also lead to differing physical results\n(as in the homogeneous case, where loop properties are extremely different from Wheeler\u2013\nDeWitt results concerning the issue of singularities and also phenomenology). This may in\nparticular be of interest in view of large quantum gravity effects derived from wave models\n[14]. On the other hand, a direct comparison between different quantizations is made more\ncomplicated by the coordinate dependent field transformation.\nWe now present the initial steps of a loop quantization along the lines followed in the\nspherically symmetric model. This will allow us to see some properties of the quantum\ngeometry. Most of the steps to arrive at the kinematical Hilbert space and basic operators\ncan be done almost identically to those followed before.\n20\n\n\fIn analogy to the spherically symmetric model we now introduce\nq\nq\nAz := A21 + A22\n,\nA\u03c6 := A23 + A24\n\u039bA\nz :=\n\nA1 \u039b1 + A2 \u039b2\nAz\n\n,\n\n\u039bA\n\u03c6 :=\n\nA3 \u039b1 + A4 \u039b2\nA\u03c6\n\n(46)\n(47)\n\nand analogously E z , E \u03c6 , \u039bzE and \u039b\u03c6E . Furthermore, we write\n\u039bA\n\u03c6 = cos \u03b2\u039b1 + sin \u03b2\u039b2\n\u03c6\n\u039bE = cos(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u039b1 + sin(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u039b2 .\n\n(48)\n(49)\n\nWith the polarization condition, this implies\n\u039bA\n= \u2212 sin \u03b2\u039b1 + cos \u03b2\u039b2\nz\nz\n\u039bE = \u2212 sin(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u039b1 + cos(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u039b2\nsuch that we have only two angles, \u03b2 which is pure gauge and \u03b1 as in the spherically\nsymmetric model.\nThe symplectic structure tells us that momenta of Az and A\u03c6 are not given by triad\ncomponents directly, but by P z := E z cos \u03b1 and P \u03c6 := E \u03c6 cos \u03b1. The momentum of \u03b2 is\nP \u03b2 := (Az E z + A\u03c6 E \u03c6 ) sin \u03b1, which is related to E x by the same Gauss constraint as in the\nspherically symmetric case.\nThe adaptation of the construction of states and operators to this model is now straightforward, the only difference being that we have one additional degree of freedom per point\non B, given by Az for which we have additional holonomies exp(i\u03bcz Az ) in vertices of spin\nnetwork states. As before, flux operators do not give us direct information about the geometry since fluxes are related to the triad in a more complicated way. Still, the orbital components of the metric in the z and \u03c6 directions are easily accessible since E z /E \u03c6 = P z /P \u03c6\nthanks to a cancellation of cos \u03b1. Thus, the spectrum of the orbital geometry can easily be\ncomputed, after using techniques as in [38] to quantize the inverse momenta. The radial\ngeometry, however, and thus the volume are more complicated, similarly to the spherically\nsymmetric volume.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nAs discussed in this paper, states and basic operators for symmetric models can be obtained\nfrom full loop quantum gravity in a direct way and lead to considerable simplifications even\nin inhomogeneous models. Hopefully, this will eventually lead to explicit investigations of\nimportant problems in the full theory, such as general field theory aspects (in particular\nrelating loop to standard field theory techniques, e.g. [19, 39, 40]), issues of the constraint\nalgebra [23, 41] and the master constraint [42], as well as explicit constructions of semiclassical states [43]. Even though, compared to homogeneous models, the system is much more\n21\n\n\fcomplicated with infinitely many kinematical degrees of freedom, the situation is simpler\nthan in the full theory.\nIn addition to the structure of states and basic operators discussed before, an advantage is that fluxes commute with each other such that there exists a flux representation.\nTransforming to such a representation from the connection representation has been of significant advantage in homogeneous models, but is not possible in the full theory with its\nnon-commuting fluxes [44]. Even so, the Hamiltonian constraint equation will turn into a\nfunctional difference equation with infinitely many independent variables for which most\nlikely new techniques would have to be developed.\nAn unexpected complication can arise in inhomogeneous models since momenta conjugate to the connection may not be identical to triad components. Thus, even though\nbasic operators are easy to deal with explicitly, this does not necessarily translate to direct\naccess to the quantum geometry, most importantly the volume operator. Since the volume\noperator also plays an important role in defining the dynamics [23] and other interesting\noperators, a complicated volume operator whose spectrum is not known explicitly would\nprobably render calculations in the model almost as hard as those in the full theory. It turns\nout that the spherically symmetric model still allows to diagonalize the volume operator\nexplicitly, and to develop an explicit calculus rather similar to that in homogeneous models\n[25]. This fact opens up the possibility of new conceptual investigations and applications\nto the physics of black holes.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is grateful to Hans Kastrup for many discussions and for initially setting him\non the track to spherically symmetric states in loop quantum gravity.
