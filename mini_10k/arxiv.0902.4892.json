For the rest of unstable particles the ratio \u0393/M\nis very small, therefore the so-called stable particle approximation is valid with very high\nprecision. The most of hadrons (mesons and baryons) have a large width and this approximation is not valid. So, we have to take into account the finite-width effects (or instability)\nin the processes with the participation of the unstable particles or resonances with a large\nwidth.\nThe specific properties of the unstable particles (UP) were being under considerable\ndiscussion during the last decades. In particular, the assumption that the decay of UP\nor resonance (R) proceeds independently of its production remains of interest [1, 2, 3].\nFormally, this effect is expressed as the factorization of a cross-section or decay rate [3].\nThe processes of type ab \u2192 Rx \u2192 cdx were considered in Ref.[3]. It was shown, that the\nfactorization always is valid for a scalar R and does not take place for a vector and spinor\nR. The factorization usually is related with the narrow-width approximation (NWA) [4],\nwhich makes five critical assumptions [5].\nWe consider the factorization method, which is based on the model of UP with a smeared\nmass [6, 7] and related with the propagator structure. The decay processes of type a \u2192\nRx \u2192 cdx were analyzed in Ref.[8]. It was shown in this work, that the factorization always\nis valid for a scalar R, while for a vector and spinor R it occurs when the propagators'\nnumerators are \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /q 2 and \u03b7\u0302(q) = q\u0302 + q, respectively, where q\u0302 = qi \u03b3 i and\np\nq = qi q i . The processes of type ab \u2192 R \u2192 cd, were considered in Ref.[9]. It was shown,\nthat the cross-section \u03c3(ab \u2192 R \u2192 cd) can be represented in the universal factorized form\n\n2\n\n\fwhen the same expressions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) and \u03b7\u0302(q) are used to describe the propagator's numerator of\nvector and spinor UP. Such a structure of propagators always provides an exact factorization\nfor any tree process. This condition of factorization is some analytical analog of NWA, which\nis discussed in Section 3 and 4. These propagators were constructed in the model of UP\nwith a smeared mass [6, 7] and describe some effective (dressed by self-energy insertion)\nunstable fields in an intermediate state. The model have been applied in the various fields\nof particles physics [6, 7]. Note that the structure of the expressions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) and \u03b7\u0302(q) is not\nrelated with the choice of the gauge (see the second section).\nIn this work, we systematically analyze the effects of factorization in the processes with\nUP in an intermediate state. In Section 2 we illustrate the premise of factorization and give\nuniversal factorized formulae for the decay rate of three-particle decay and for the crosssection of two-particle scattering. The factorization approach is applied to the processes of\nscattering with consequent decays of the final states (Section 3). It was noted, that similar\nprocesses were considered in Refs.[10, 11], where the phenomenon of pseudoresonances was\ndiscussed. In Section 4, we analyze some methodological and phenomenological aspects of\nfactorization.\n\nII.\n\nFACTORIZATION EFFECT IN THE MODEL OF UNSTABLE PARTICLES\n\nWITH A SMEARED MASS\n\nIn this section, we consider the structure of the model amplitude when UP is in the\nintermediate state. We show that the special form of the model propagators of unstable\nfields lead to the factorization of the transition probability. In contrast to the traditional\ntreatment (narrow-width approximation, NWA), the approach suggested provides an exact\nfactorization for the any type of UP. This effect makes it possible to represent the decay\n3\n\n\frate of three-particle decays and the cross-section of two-particle scattering in the universal\nfactorized form.\nThe model propagators of scalar, vector and spinor unstable fields are defined by the\nfollowing expressions (see Appendix 1):\ni\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /q 2\nq\u0302 + q\n;\n\u2212i\n; i\n.\n2\n2\nP (q )\nP (q )\nP (q 2 )\nIn Eqs.(2.1) q 2 = (qi q i ), q =\n\np\n\n(2.1)\n\n(qi q i ) and P (q 2 ) can be defined in arbitrary way (pole,\n\nBreit-Wigner and other definitions). It is essential, that the effect of factorization does not\ndepend on the definition of denominator P (q 2 ) and crucially depends on the structure of\npropagator's numerators for the case of vector and spinor fields. The model expressions\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /q 2 and \u03b7\u0302(q) = q\u0302 + q provide an exact factorization, while the traditional\nexpressions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (M) = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212q\u03bc q\u03bd /M 2 and \u03b7\u0302(M) = q\u0302+M leads to an approximate factorization\n(NWA). It should be noted, that the structure of \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) and \u03b7\u0302(q) is not related with the\nchoice of the gauge. The model under consideration is not a gauge one and describes some\neffective unstable fields (see Appendix 1). We note, also, that the differences between the\nmodel and traditional \u03b7 -functions are small at q 2 \u2248 M 2 . So, the model approach can be\ntreated as approximation to the standard one, that is gives an analytical alternative of NWA\n(see Section 4)\nNow, we consider the mechanism of factorization in the processes of three-particle decay\n\u03a61 \u2192 \u03a62 R \u2192 \u03a62 \u03a63 \u03a64 and two-particle scattering \u03a61 \u03a62 \u2192 R \u2192 \u03a63 \u03a64 . In the case of vector\nUP in an intermediate state the model amplitude is\nM \u223c \u03a61 \u0393\u03bc \u03a62\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /q 2\n\u03a63 \u0393\u03bd \u03a64 .\nP (q 2)\n\n(2.2)\n\nIt is essential, that the structure of propagator's numerator and polarization matrix is the\n\n4\n\n\fsame (Appendix 1):\n3\nX\nk=1\n\n2\nek\u03bc (q)e\u2217k\n\u03bd (q) = \u2212(g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /q ).\n\n(2.3)\n\nThus, from Eqs.(2.2) and (2.3) it follows\nM \u223c\n(k)\n\nwhere M1\n\n(k)\n\n\u223c \u03a61 \u0393\u03bc \u03a62 ek\u03bc and M2\n\n3\n(k)\n(k)\nX\nM *M\n1\n\n2\n\nP (q 2)\n\nk=1\n\n,\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u223c \u03a63 \u0393\u03bd \u03a64 ek\u03bd . From Eq.(2.4) it follows, that for the case of\n\nscalar UP, exact factorization occurs at amplitude level (see also [3, 8]). The quasifactorized\nstructure of the full amplitude M is direct consequence of Eq.(2.3), that is of the smearing\nof mass-shell. Full factorization occur in the |M |2, when the properties of the polarization\nmatrixes of the initial and final states are used. In the standard treatment factorization\ntakes place when the intermediate state occur on mass-shell q 2 = M 2 , while the virtual\nstates destroy the factorization. In our approach this effect takes place at arbitrary q 2 due\nto smearing (fuzzing) of mass-shell (see Appendix 1) and some dualism of virtual and real\nstates. This dualism imply the possibility to describe UP by polarization matrix (real state)\nand propagators (virtual state) at the same time [6, 8]. More exactly, the division of the\nunstable states onto virtual and real ones have no sense in the vicinity of the resonance.\nThe same effect takes place for the case of spinor UP in an intermediate state. In this\ncase, the structure of spinor propagator's numerator \u03b7\u0302(q) = q\u0302 + q is similar to the structure\nof spinor polarization matrix (Appendix 1):\n2\nX\n\na,\u2213\nua,\u00b1\n\u03b1 (q)\u016b\u03b2 (q) =\n\na=1\n\n1\n(q\u0302 \u2213 q)\u03b1\u03b2 .\n2q 0\n\n(2.5)\n\nThus, the premise of factorization is the coincidence of the polarization matrix and propagator's numerator for any q 2 , which is directly related with the smearing (fuzzing) of mass-shell.\nLet us consider the three-particle decay of type \u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 R \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 \u03c63 , where R is UP of\nany kind with a large width. The method of calculation and some specific details of the\n5\n\n\fmodel approach are given in Appendix 2. By straightforward calculation it was checked,\nthat the decay rates of the processes under consideration can be represented in the universal\nfactorized form:\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 \u03c63 ) =\n\nZ\n\nq22\n\nq12\n\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 R(q))\n\nq\u0393(R(q) \u2192 \u03c62 \u03c63 ) 2\ndq ,\n\u03c0|PR (q)|2\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere q1 = m2 + m3 and q2 = m\u03a6 \u2212 m1 . By means of the summation over decay channels\nof R, from Eq.(2.6) we get the well-known convolution formula for the decays with UP in a\nfinal state [7, 8, 12, 13]:\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 R) =\n\nZ\n\nq22\n\nq12\n\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 R(q))\u03c1R (q)dq 2 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn Eq.(2.7) the smearing of mass of unstable state R is described by the probability density\n\u03c1R (q):\n\u03c1R (q) =\n\nq\u0393tot\nR (q)\n.\n\u03c0|PR (q)|2\n\n(2.8)\n\nIf the parametrization q\u0393(q) = Im\u03a3(q) and Dyson-resummed propagator are used, then we\nget:\nPR (q) = q 2 \u2212 m2R (q) \u2212 iIm\u03a3R (q), m2R (q) = m20R + Re\u03a3R (q),\n\n(2.9)\n\nand the \u03c1R (q) can be written in the Lorentzian (Breit-Wigner type) form:\n\u03c1R (q) =\n\n1\nIm\u03a3R (q)\n.\n2\n2\n\u03c0 [q \u2212 mR (q)]2 + [Im\u03a3R (q)]2\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe expressions similar to (2.10) have been used in the many papers [6]-[13].\nNow, we consider the two-particle scattering of type a + b \u2192 R \u2192 c + d, where R is UP\nwith a large width. With the help of the expressions (2.1) we have got by straightforward\ncalculations (see Appendix 2) the universal factorized formula for the cross-section for all\npermissible combinations of particles (a, b, R, c, d):\n\u03c3(ab \u2192 R \u2192 cd) =\n\ncd\n\u0393ab\n16\u03c0(2JR + 1)\nR (s)\u0393R (s)\n.\n\u221a\n(2Ja + 1)(2Jb + 1)\u03bb\u03042 (ma , mb ; s) |PR (s)|2\n\n6\n\n(2.11)\n\n\fIn Eq.(2.11) Jk is spin of the particle (k = a, b, R), s = (p1 + p2 )2 , \u0393ab\nR (s) = \u0393(R(s) \u2192 ab)\nand PR (s) is propagator's denominator of the UP or resonance R. The expressions for\ncd\n\u0393ab\nR (s) and \u0393R (s) follow from the standard ones (see Appendix 2), when squared mass of\n\nUP is m2R = q 2 = s. The factorization of cross-section does not depend on the definition of\nPR (s), which can be determined in a phenomenological way, in Breit-Wigner or pole form\netc. The expression (2.11) is a natural generalization of the spin-averaged Breit-Wigner\n(non-relativistic) cross-section, defined by the expression (37.51) in Ref. [14]. Note that\nthe factorization is exact in our approach, while in the traditional one it occurs as an\napproximation.\nThe cross-section of exclusive process ab \u2192 R \u2192 cd, defined by Eq.(2.11), does not\ndepend on Jc and Jd . So, it can be summarized over final channels R \u2192 cd:\n\u03c3(ab \u2192 R(s) \u2192 all) =\nIn Eq.(2.12) ki = 2Ji + 1 and \u0393tot\nR (s) =\n\ntot\n16\u03c0kR\n\u0393ab\nR (s)\u0393R (s)\n.\n\u221a\nka kb \u03bb\u03042 (ma , mb ; s) |PR (s)|2\n\nP\n\ncd\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u0393cd\nR (s), where for simplicity we restrict ourselves\n\nby two-particle channels.\nThe factorization effect, expressed by Eq.(2.11), has two aspects. On the one hand,\nit means that the decay of UP proceeds independently of its production in the approach\nconsidered. On the other hand, it leads to the significant simplification of calculations, in\nparticular, in the case of the complicated processes (see the next section).\n\nIII.\n\nFACTORIZATION EFFECT IN THE COMPLICATED PROCESSES\n\nIn this section, we consider the factorization effects in the case of complicated chain\nprocesses. For example, let us consider the decay-chain process \u03a6 \u2192 aR \u2192 abR1 \u2192 abcd.\nIt is convenient to divide this process onto the stages \u03a6 \u2192 aR \u2192 abR1 and R1 \u2192 cd. In\n7\n\n\faccording with the Eq.(2.6) the width of the first process is\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 abR1 ) =\n\nZ\n\nq22\nq12\n\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 aR(q))\n\nq\u0393(R(q) \u2192 bR1 ) 2\ndq ,\n\u03c0|PR (q)|2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u0393(R(q) \u2192 bR1 ) includes all decay channels of R1 . Analogously, the width of exclusive\ndecay R(q) \u2192 bR1 \u2192 bcd is defined by the expression:\n\u0393(R(q) \u2192 bcd) =\n\nZ\n\ng22\n\ng12\n\n\u0393(R(q) \u2192 bR1 (g))\n\ng\u0393(R1(g) \u2192 cd) 2\ndg ,\n\u03c0|PR1 (g)|2\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere g1 = mc + md and g2 = m\u03a6 \u2212 ma \u2212 mb . Combining the expressions (3.1) and (3.2),\nwe get the width of the full decay-chain process:\n1\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 abcd) = 2\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nq22\n\nq12\n\nq\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 aR(q))\n|PR (q)|2\n\nZ\n\ng22\n\ng12\n\n\u0393(R(q) \u2192 bR1 (g))\n\ng\u0393(R1(g) \u2192 cd) 2 2\ndg dq .\n|PR1 (g)|2\n\n(3.3)\n\nUsing this method, one can write the width for the more complicated decay-chain processes.\nWe should note that the factorization reduces the number of independent kinematical variables which specify a point in the phase space. In the general case of n-particle decay the\nnumber of such variable is N = 3n \u2212 7 [15]. Thus, in the standard approach, for threeand four-particle decays we have N = 2 and N = 5. The factorization effect reduces these\nnumbers and gives N = 1 (Eq.(2.6)) and N = 2 (Eq.(3.3)), respectively.\nNow, we consider the scattering ab \u2192 R \u2192 xR1 with consequent decay R1 \u2192 cd. In this\ncase, Eq.(2.11) has the form:\nR1 x\n16\u03c0kR\n\u0393ab\nR (s)\u0393R (s)\n.\n\u03c3(ab \u2192 R(s) \u2192 xR1 ) =\n\u221a\nka kb \u03bb\u03042 (ma , mb ; s) |PR (s)|2\n\n(3.4)\n\nR1 x\nTo calculate the value \u0393R\n(s) we apply the convolution formula (2.7), which accounts FWE\n\nin the decay R(s) \u2192 xR1 :\n\u0393(R(s) \u2192 xR1 ) =\n\nZ\n\nq22\nq12\n\n\u0393(R(s) \u2192 xR1 (q))\u03c1R1 (q) dq 2 .\n8\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fIn Eq.(3.5) q = pR \u2212 px , q1,2 are defined by kinematics of the process and \u03c1R1 (q) =\n2\nq\u0393tot\nR1 (q)/\u03c0|PR1 (q)| is interpreted in the model of UP as distribution function of the smeared\n\nmass of unstable particle R1 . Convolution structure of Eq.(3.5) is caused by the factorization\nof the decay rate \u0393(R \u2192 xR1 \u2192 x, all).\nFrom Eqs.(3.4) and (3.5) it follows:\n\u03c3(ab \u2192 R \u2192 xR1 ) =\n16\u03c0kR\n\u0393ab\nR (s)\n\u221a\n2\nka kb \u03bb\u0304 (ma , mb ; s) |PR (s)|2\n\nZ\n\nq22\nq12\n\n\u0393(R(s) \u2192 xR1 (q))\u03c1R1 (q) dq 2.\n\n(3.6)\n\nUsing the expression for \u03c1R1 (q), from Eq.(3.6) we can get the cross-section of exclusive\nprocess, for example ab \u2192 R \u2192 R1 x \u2192 cdx. To this effect we represent \u0393tot\nR1 (q) in the form:\n\u0393tot\nR1 (q) =\n\nX\nX1\n\ncd\n1\n\u0393X\nR1 (q); \u0393R1 (q) = \u0393(R1 (q) \u2192 cd) .\n\n(3.7)\n\nAs a result, from (3.6) and (3.7) we get:\n\u03c3(ab \u2192 R \u2192 xcd) =\n16kR\n\u0393ab\nR (s)\n\u221a\n2\nka kb \u03bb\u0304 (ma , mb ; s) |PR (s)|2\n\nZ\n\nq22\n\nq12\n\nq\u0393cd\n(q)\n\u0393(R(s) \u2192 xR1 (q)) R1 2 dq 2 .\n|PR1 (q)|\n\n(3.8)\n\nIt should be noted that, in analogy with the decay processes, the factorization effectively\nreduces the number of independent kinematical variables in the scattering processes too. In\nthe standard approach for the process 2 \u2192 3 the number of such variables N = 3n \u2212 4 = 5\n[15], while the approach suggested gives N = 1.\nThe processes of scattering with one unstable particle or resonance and one quasistable\nparticle in the final state were discussed in [10, 11]. Such processes, called in [10] as pseudoresonances, exhibit themselves as peak in cross-section in analogy with ordinary resonance.\nHowever, they are not caused by the pole of S-matrix, rather by nonelastic channels [11].\n\n9\n\n\fSimilar structure arises in the case R \u2192 R1 R2 , i.e. when there are two UP in the final\nstate, which have two-particle decay channels (semi-analytical approach [16]-[18]). Thus,\nthe model gives a convenient instrument to describe two-particle scattering accompanied\nby complicated decay-chain processes. However, we have checked by direct calculations\nonly two types of processes - the decay of type a \u2192 Rx \u2192 bcx and the scattering of type\nab \u2192 R \u2192 cd. The more complicated processes, such as decay a \u2192 R1 R2 \u2192 cdef and\nscattering ab \u2192 R \u2192 R1 R2 \u2192 cdef , will be the subject of the next paper.\n\nIV.\n\nPHENOMENOLOGY OF THE FACTORIZATION METHOD\n\nIn this section, we consider some methodological and phenomenological aspects of factorization. The model factorization of a decay width and cross-section of the processes\nwith UP in an intermediate state was established by straightforward calculations at tree\nlevel. Note that these calculations in the effective theory of UP [7, 8] account for some loop\ncontributions. The vertex and self-energy type corrections can be included into \u0393R (s) and\nPR (s) respectively. These corrections do not breakdown a factorization, but the interaction\nbetween initial and final states does. However, such an interaction has no clear and explicit\nstatus in perturbation theory due to UP (or resonance) is not a perturbative object in the\nresonance neighborhood [7]. As it was noted in Ref.[18], such non-factorable corrections give\nsmall contribution to the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZZ, W W, 4f in the resonance range.\nNow, we consider another aspect of factorization effect, namely, the determination of\ndressed propagator of UP. Factorization of decay width and cross-section does not depend\non the structure of propagator's denominator PR (q), but crucially depends on the structure\nof its numerator in the case of vector and spinor UP. As it was verified by direct calculations,\nthe factorization always takes place in the case of scalar UP. The expressions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (mR ) =\n10\n\n\fg\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /m2R and \u03b7\u0302(mR ) = q\u0302 + mR for vector and spinor UP, respectively, do not lead to\nexact factorization. But the expressions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /q 2 and \u03b7\u0302(q) = q\u0302 + q strictly\nlead to factorization for any kinds of particles. It should be noted that the definition of the\nfunctions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) and \u03b7\u0302(q) is not related with the choice of the gauge, because effective theory\nof UP [7] is not the gauge theory. The choice of q instead of mR in the \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b7\u0302 may seems\ncontradict to the equation of motion for vector and spinor UP. However, this statement is\nvalid for the stable particle with fixed mass. In the case of UP the question arises what\nthe mass participates in equation of motion - pole mass or one of the renormalized mass?\nAn account of uncertainty relation by smearing of mass intensifies the question. There is\nno unique and strict determination of dressed propagator structure for vector and spinor\nUP due to the specific nature of renormalization in these cases [8]. The situation is more\ncomplicated and involved in the case of hadron resonance. So, the functions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b7\u0302 have\nrather phenomenological (or model) than theoretical status. The model of UP [7] defines\nthese functions as \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) and \u03b7\u0302(q), which describe the dressed propagators of UP in the\nresonance neighborhood.\nFurther, we briefly analyze the phenomenological aspect of the factorization effect. Universal convolution formula for a decay rate was widely used in the so-called convolution method (CM). This method introduces the factorization in a phenomenological way.\nIt was applied for the description of the near-threshold decays of t quark [12, 13] and\nnon-leptonic decays of hadrons [19]-[22]. The decay rates of the near-threshold decays\nt \u2192 bW Z, cW W, cZZ were calculated within the framework of CM and DCM (decay-chain\nmethod) in Refs.[12, 13]. The contributions of FWE lead to the substantial enhancement of\nthe decay rates, in particular, of B(t \u2192 bW Z) and B(t \u2192 cZZ). For instance, the branchings without (B) and with an accounting of FWE (B\u0304) in the case of decay t \u2192 bW Z differ\n11\n\n\fby an order of magnitude [12]: B(t \u2192 bW Z) \u223c 10\u22127 and B\u0304(t \u2192 bW Z) \u223c 10\u22126 . The description of FWE in hadron decays of type H \u2192 H1 H2 is directly follows from the approach\nsuggested, when H1 and (or) H2 are the hadrons with a large width. The contribution of\n0\n+ \u2212\n0\n+ \u2212\nFWE to decay rates of the decays B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c1+ , B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 a+\n1 and \u039bb \u2192 \u039bc \u03c1 , \u039bb \u2192 \u039bc a1\n\nwere considered in Refs.[19]-[22] within the framework of CM. The result of calculations\nreveals that the contributions of FWE are large (from 20 to 40 percent) and its account\nimproves the conformity of the experimental data and theoretical predictions. In the work\n[7], we have reanalyzed the decays B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c1+ and \u03c6(1020) \u2192 K K\u0304 within the frame of the\nmodel considered and significantly improve the correspondence between the experimental\ndata and theoretical predictions.\nNow, we analyze the phenomenology of the factorization in the processes of scattering.\nIn the low-energy experiments of type e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c1, \u03c9... \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , ... we can not distinguish\npropagators \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (mR ) and \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (q) even for the wide resonance. This is due to the equality\n\u0113\u2212 (p1 )(p\u03021 + p\u03022 )e\u2212 (p2 ) = 0, when the functions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd reduce to g\u03bc\u03bd in both cases. In the highenergy experiments of type e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2192 f \u0304f , where f is quark or lepton (we neglect \u03b3 \u2212 Z\ninterference), the transverse part of amplitude is\nMq \u223c \u0113\u2212 (p1 )q\u0302(ce \u2212 \u03b35 )e\u2212 (p2 )f \u0304+ (k1 )q\u0302(cf \u2212 \u03b35 )f + (k2 ),\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere q = p1 +p2 = k1 +k2 . From Eq.(4.1) with the help of the Dirac equations in momentum\nrepresentation it follows\nMq \u223c me mf \u0113\u2212 (p1 )\u03b35 e\u2212 (p2 )f \u0304+ (k1 )\u03b35 f + (k2 ).\n\n(4.2)\n\nAs a result, we get the terms me mf /q 2 and me mf /m2Z for \u03b7(q) and \u03b7(mR ), respectively.\nThe difference of these values is an order of (me mf /m2Z ) * (mZ \u2212 q)/mZ at q 2 \u223c m2Z . Thus,\nthe distinction between the structure of two type of the expressions \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is negligible in a\n12\n\n\fwide range of energy. We always can evaluate this deviation, that is the approach suggested\ngives us a simple analytical analog of NWA. This approach was applied also to the nearthreshold Z-pair production [18] in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZZ, where the model polarization\nmatrix (2.3) was used. An accordance with the experiment and Monte-Carlo simulation\nwas demonstrated. From this result, it follows that the contribution of the non-factorable\ncorrections is small at the resonance energy.\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nThe structure of \u03b7\u0302 can be studied in the process of type V F \u2192 R \u2192 V F , where V and\nF are vector and fermion field, R is, for instance, baryon resonance with a large width. In\nthis case, the difference between \u03b7\u0302(mR ) and \u03b7\u0302(q) is characterized by the value \u223c \u0393R /mR at\npeak region, and this problem demands more detailed consideration.\nFrom this brief analysis it follows that the method of factorization is a simple analytical\nanalog of the narrow-width approximation (NWA, which contains five critical assumptions\n[5]). Instead, we use the structure of propagators' numerators \u03b7(q), which follows from usual\nones under a simple transformation mR \u2192 q, and one assumption: there is no significant\ninterference with non-resonant processes (fifth assumption of NWA). The rest assumptions\nof NWA can be derived from the first our point, where some of them are not obligatory\nin the special cases. The method leads to factorization in the basic type of processes decay-chain processes (universal convolution formula (2.7)) and scattering ones (universal\nfactorized formula (2.11)). Combining these two results, we get a simple and strict algorithm\nof analytical description of the complicated chain processes.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe factorization method gives us a convenient semianalytical way to describe the threeparticle decays and two-particle scattering processes. This effect significantly simplifies\n13\n\n\fcalculations and gives compact universal formulae for the decay rate and cross-section.\nIn this work, we have shown that the factorization always is valid when scalar UP is in\nthe intermediate state. In the case of vector or spinor intermediate states, the factorization\ntakes place when the specific propagators are used for these states. These propagators are\nderived in the model of UP with a random (smeared) mass. They negligibly differ from the\ntraditional propagators at peak area and follow from the smearing of mass in accordance with\nan uncertainty relation. Our method makes it possible significantly simplify the description\nof the complicated decay-chain and scattering processes. It is some analytical analog of NWA\nand gives a simple and strict algorithm for calculations. This approach can be treated also\nas a convenient approximation to the traditional one, which always is valid in the resonance\nrange, where non-resonance contribution is small.\nWe have performed also a short methodological and phenomenological analysis of the\napproach under discussion. It was shown, that in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 f f \u0304 the difference\nbetween two forms of propagators is negligible in a wide range of energy. It can be significant\nin the processes with baryon resonance in an intermediate state, but in this case we should\nperform an additional analysis.\n\nAPPENDIX A: APPENDIX 1\n\nIn this section, we represent the model formalism we need to construct the propagators for\nthe vector and spinor fields (for the detail see [6, 7]). The structure of these propagators lead\nto the factorization effect in the processes with the participation of UP in the intermediate\nstate. The model field wave function, which describes UP, is\n\u03a6a (x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a6a (x, \u03bc)\u03c9(\u03bc)d\u03bc,\n\n14\n\n(A1)\n\n\fwhere \u03a6a (x, \u03bc) is spectral component, which defines a particle with a fixed mass squared\nm2 = \u03bc in the stable particle approximation (SPA):\n1\n\u03a6\u03b1 (x, \u03bc) =\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\nZ\n\n\u03a6\u03b1 (k)\u03b4(k 2 \u2212 \u03bc)eikx dk.\n\n(A2)\n\nThe weight function \u03c9(\u03bc) is formed by the self-energy type interactions of UP with vacuum\nfluctuations and decay products. This function describes the smeared (fuzzed) mass-shell of\nUP.\nThe model Lagrangian, which determines a \"free\" (effective) unstable field \u03a6(x), has the\nconvolution form:\nL(\u03a6(x)) =\n\nZ\n\nL(\u03a6(x, \u03bc))|\u03c9(\u03bc)|2 d\u03bc .\n\n(A3)\n\nIn Eq.(A3) L(\u03a6(x, \u03bc)) is the standard Lagrangian, which describes model \"free\" field component \u03a6(x, \u03bc) in the stable particle approximation (m2 = \u03bc).\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nFrom Eq.(A3) and prescription \u2202\u03a6(x, \u03bc)/\u2202\u03a6(x, \u03bc ) = \u03b4(\u03bc\u2212\u03bc ) it follows the Klein-Gordon\nequation for the spectral component of the unstable field:\n(\u0003 \u2212 \u03bc)\u03a6\u03b1 (x, \u03bc) = 0.\n\n(A4)\n\nAs a result, we get the standard representation (A2) of the spectral component \u03a6\u03b1 (x, \u03bc)\nwith a fixed mass parameter \u03bc. All standard definitions, relations and frequency expansion\np\ntake place for \u03a6\u03b1 (k, \u03bc), however, the relation k\u03bc0 = k2 + \u03bc defines the smeared (fuzzy)\nmass-shell due to a random nature of the mass parameter \u03bc. In analogy with (A4) one\ncan get the Dirac equation (i\u2202\u02c6 +\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bc)\u03a8(x, \u03bc) = 0 for fermion spectral component. The\n\nconvolution (diagonal) representation of the \"free\" Lagrangian (A3) has an assumption (or\napproximation?) that the states with different \u03bc do not interact in the approximation of the\nmodel \"free\" fields.\n\n15\n\n\fThe expressions (A1)\u2013(A4) define the model \"free\" unstable field as some effective field.\nAs it was mentioned above, this field is formed by an interaction of \"bare\" UP with the\nvacuum fluctuations and decay products, that is includes the self-energy contribution. This\ninteraction leads to the spreading (smearing) of mass, described by the function \u03c9(\u03bc) or\n\u03c1(\u03bc) = |\u03c9(\u03bc)|2. Thus, we go from the distribution \u03c1st (\u03bc) = \u03b4(\u03bc \u2212 M 2 ) for \"bare\" particles\nto some smooth density function \u03c1(\u03bc) = |\u03c9(\u03bc)|2 with mean value \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 M 2 and mean square\ndeviation \u03c3\u03bc \u2248 \u0393. So, the UP is characterized by the weight function \u03c9(\u03bc) or probability\ndensity \u03c1(\u03bc) with parameters M and \u0393 (or real and imaginary parts of a pole).\nThe commutative relations for the model operators have an additional \u03b4-function:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n+\n[\u03a6\u0307\u2212\n\u03b1 (k, \u03bc), \u03a6\u03b2 (q, \u03bc )]\u00b1 = \u03b4(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc )\u03b4(k \u2212 q)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(A5)\n\u2032\n\nwhere subscripts \u00b1 correspond to the fermion and boson fields. The presence of \u03b4(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc )\nin Eq.(A5) means an assumption - the acts of creation and annihilation of the particles\nwith different \u03bc (the random mass squared) do not interfere. Thus, the parameter \u03bc has\nthe status of physically distinguishable value of a random m2 . This assumption is naturally\nrelated with a diagonal form of Eqs.(A3) and (A4). By integrating both sides of Eq.(A5)\n\u2032\n\nwith weights \u03c9 \u2217(\u03bc)\u03c9(\u03bc ) one can get the standard commutative relations\n+\n[\u03a6\u0307\u2212\n\u03b1 (k), \u03a6\u03b2 (q)]\u00b1 = \u03b4(k \u2212 q)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u00b1\n\u03b1 (k) is full operator field function in the momentum representation:\n\u03a6\u00b1\n\u03b1 (k)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03a6\u00b1\n\u03b1 (k, \u03bc)\u03c9(\u03bc)d\u03bc .\n\n(A7)\n\nThe amplitude for the transition \u03a6 \u2192 R\u03c61 , where R is scalar UP with a large width, has\nthe form\nA(k, \u03bc) = \u03c9(\u03bc)Ast(k, \u03bc) ,\n16\n\n(A8)\n\n\fwhere Ast (k, \u03bc) is the amplitude in a stable particle approximation. This amplitude is\ncalculated in the standard way and can include the higher corrections. The differential (on\nk) probability is\nd\u0393(k) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u0393st (k, \u03bc)\u03c1(\u03bc)d\u03bc .\n\n(A9)\n\nIn Eq.(A9) the differential probability d\u0393st (k, \u03bc) is defined in the standard way (stable\nparticle approximation):\nd\u0393st (k, \u03bc) =\n\n1\n\u03b4(k\u03a6 \u2212 kR \u2212 k1 )|Ast (k, \u03bc)|2dk\u03c6 dk1 ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(A10)\n\nwhere k = (k\u03a6 , kR , k1) denotes the 4-momenta of particles. From Eqs.(A9) and (A10) it\ndirectly follows the well-known convolution formula (CF) for a decay rate\n\u0393(m\u03a6 , m1 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc2\n\n\u0393st (m\u03a6 , m1 ; \u03bc)\u03c1(\u03bc)d\u03bc ,\n\n(A11)\n\n\u03bc1\n\nwhere \u03c1(\u03bc) = |\u03c9(\u03bc)|2, \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the threshold and maximal invariant mass squared of an\nunstable particle. If there are two UP with large widths in a final state of decay \u03a6 \u2192 R1 R2 ,\nthen in analogy with the previous case one can get the double convolution formula:\n\u0393(m\u03a6 ) =\n\nZ Z\n\n\u0393st (m\u03a6 ; \u03bc1 , \u03bc2)\u03c11 (\u03bc1 )\u03c12 (\u03bc2 )d\u03bc1 d\u03bc2 .\n\n(A12)\n\nThe derivation of CF for the cases, when there is a vector or spinor UP in the final state,\ncan be done in analogy with the case of scalar UP. However, in Eqs.(A8) and (A10) one\nshould take into account the polarization vector em (q) or spinor u\u03bd,\u00b1\n\u03b1 (q), where momentum q\nis on fuzzy mass-shell. In this case, we derive the polarization matrixes in full analogy with\nstandard derivation, but taking into consideration modified Klein-Gordan (A4) and Dirac\nequations. As a result, we get the polarization matrix with m2 = \u03bc, that is on smeared\nmass-shell. In the case of vector UP in the final state we have:\nX\ne\n\nem (q)e\u2217n (q) = \u2212gmn + qm qn /\u03bc ,\n17\n\n(A13)\n\n\fwhere q\u03bc0 =\n\np\nq2 + \u03bc and the summation over polarization is implied. In the case of spinor\n\nUP in the final state:\nX\n\n\u03bd,\u2213\nu\u03bd,\u00b1\n\u03b1 (q)\u016b\u03b2 (q) =\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u221a\n1\n(q\u0302 \u2213 \u03bc)\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n0\n2q\u03bc\n\n(A14)\n\nThe same relations take place for the initial states, however one have to average over the\npolarizations.\nNow, we consider the structure of the model propagators. With the help of the traditional\nmethod, one can get from Eqs.(A1), (A5) and (A7) the expression for the unstable scalar\nGreen function [6]:\nh0|T (\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y))|0i \u2261 D(x \u2212 y) =\n\nZ\n\nD(x \u2212 y, \u03bc)\u03c1(\u03bc)d\u03bc .\n\n(A15)\n\nIn Eq.(A15) D(x, \u03bc) is a standard scalar Green function, which describes UP in an intermediate state with a fixed m2 = \u03bc:\ni\nD(x, \u03bc) =\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212ikx\ndk .\nk 2 \u2212 \u03bc + i\u01eb\n\n(A16)\n\nThe right-hand side of Eq.(A15) is the Lehmann-like spectral (on \u03bc) representation of the\nscalar Green function. Taking into account the relation between scalar and vector Green\nfunctions, we can get the Green function of the vector unstable field in the form:\n1 \u22022\n)D(x, \u03bc)\nDmn (x, \u03bc) = \u2212 (gmn +\n\u03bc \u2202xn \u2202xm\nZ\n\u2212i\ngmn \u2212 km kn /\u03bc \u2212ikx\n=\ne\ndk .\n4\n(2\u03c0)\nk 2 \u2212 \u03bc + i\u01eb\nAnalogously, the Green function of the spinor unstable field is\nZ\n\u221a\nk\u0302 + \u03bc \u2212ikx\ni\n\u221a\n\u02c6\ne\ndk ,\nD\u0302(x, \u03bc) = (i\u2202 + \u03bc)D(x, \u03bc) =\n(2\u03c0)4\nk 2 \u2212 \u03bc + i\u01eb\n\n(A17)\n\n(A18)\n\nwhere k\u0302 = ki \u03b3 i . These Green functions in momentum representation have a convolution\nform:\nDmn (k) = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\ngmn \u2212 km kn /\u03bc\n\u03c1(\u03bc)d\u03bc ,\nk 2 \u2212 \u03bc + i\u01eb\n18\n\n(A19)\n\n\fand\nD\u0302(k) = i\n\nZ\n\nk2\n\nk\u0302 + k\n\u03c1(\u03bc)d\u03bc ,\n\u2212 \u03bc + i\u01eb\n\n(A20)\n\nTo construct the model propagators in explicit form we need to define the probability density\n\u03c1(\u03bc). Here, we represent the definition of \u03c1(\u03bc) from the matching the model propagators to\nthe standard dressed ones [6, 7]. We associate the model propagator of scalar unstable field\n(A15, A16) in a momentum representation with the standard dressed one:\nZ\n\n\u03c1(\u03bc)d\u03bc\n1\n\u2190\u2192\n,\n2\nk 2 \u2212 \u03bc + i\u01eb\nk 2 \u2212 m0 \u2212 \u03a0(k 2 )\n\n(A21)\n\nwhere \u03a0(k 2 ) is the conventional polarization operator ( or self-energy) of scalar field. With\nthe help of the analytic continuation method it was shown in [6], that the conformity (A21)\nleads to the definition:\n\u03c1(\u03bc) =\n\n1\nIm\u03a0(\u03bc)\n,\n2\n\u03c0 [\u03bc \u2212 m (\u03bc)]2 + [Im\u03a0(\u03bc)]2\n\n(A22)\n\nwhere m2 (\u03bc) = m20 + Re\u03a0(k 2 ). The expression (A22) for \u03c1(k 2 ) in the Breit-Wigner approximation is usually exploited within the framework of the convolution method.\nInserting \u03c1(\u03bc) into the model propagator (A19) for vector unstable field leads to the\nresult [7]:\nDmn (k) = \u2212i\n\ngmn \u2212 km kn /k 2\n.\nk 2 \u2212 m2 (k 2 ) \u2212 iIm\u03a0(k 2 )\n\nAn analogous procedure with Eq.(A20) and the change Im\u03a0(\u03bc) \u2192\n\n(A23)\n\u221a\n\n\u03bcIm\u03a3(\u03bc) leads to the\n\ndefinition:\nD\u0302(k) = i\n\nk2\n\n\u2212\n\nk\u0302 + k\n,\n\u2212 ik\u03a3(k 2 )\n\nm2 (k 2 )\n\n(A24)\n\nEqs. (A21)\u2013 (A24) establish the correspondence between the model under consideration and\nsome effective theory of UP in the framework of traditional QFT approach. This effective\ntheory has a close analogy with the traditional description of UP in the intermediate state\nas a special case of the approach discussed. The most important features of the effective\n19\n\n\ftheory, constructed in such a way, are the factorization and convolution effects (see Section\n2 and Appendix B). These effects arise due to the specific structure of the propagator's\nnumerators \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (k) = gmn \u2212 km kn /k 2 and \u03b7\u0302(k) = k\u0302 + k (M \u2192 k, smearing of the mass-shell).\n\nAPPENDIX B: APPENDIX 2\n\nIn this section, we consider convenient and simple method of calculation of three-particle\ndecay rate and two-particle cross-section. This method is based on the model of UP with a\nsmeared mass, where the expressions for polarization matrixes (A13), (A14) and propagators\n(A21)\u2013(A24) are constructed. The vertexes are defined by the Lagrangian in the simplest\nstandard form:\n,\u03bc\n\u03bc\nLk =g\u03c6\u03c61\u03c62 ; g\u03c6\u03c8\u03041 \u03c82 ; g\u03c6V1\u03bcV2\u03bc ; gV\u03bc (\u03c6,\u03bc\n1 \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c62 \u03c61 ); gV\u03bc \u03c8\u03041 \u03b3 (cV + cA \u03b35 )\u03c82 ;\n\ngV1\u03bc V2\u03bd V\u03b1 [g \u03bc\u03bd (p2 \u2212 p1 )\u03b1 + g \u03bc\u03b1 (2p1 + p2 )\u03bd \u2212 g \u03bd\u03b1 (p1 + 2p2 )\u03bc ].\n\n(B1)\n\nIn the expressions (B1) \u03c6, V and \u03c8 are the scalar, vector and spinor fields, respectively, p1\nand p2 are the momenta of particles. It is convenient to employ the universal expressions\nfor widths \u0393(R \u2192 ab) or \u0393(a \u2192 Rb) in a stable particle approximation:\n\u0393i (R \u2192 ab) =\n\ng2\n\u03bb\u0304(ma , mb ; mR )fi (ma , mb ; mR ),\n8\u03c0\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere m2R = q 2 = (p1 + p2 )2 and:\n\u03bb\u0304(ma , mb ; mR ) = [1 \u2212 2\n\n(m2a \u2212 m2b )2 1/2\nm2a + m2b\n+\n] .\nm2R\nm4R\n\n(B3)\n\nThe same expressions and relations are in order for the width \u0393(a \u2192 Rb). The functions\nfi (ma , mb ; mR ) are defined by the corresponding vertexes. If these vertexes are described by\nEqs.(B1), then the functions fi (further we omit the arguments) in tree approximation are\n20\n\n\fdefined by the following expressions:\n(m2\u03c6 \u2212 m21 \u2212 m22 )2\n1\n1\n];\n; \u03c6 \u2192 V1 V2 , f2 =\n[1 +\n2m\u03c6\nm\u03c6\n8m21 m22\nm3\u03c6 2\n(m1 + m2 )2\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\u03041 \u03c82 , f3 = m\u03c6 [1 \u2212\n]; \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c61 V, f4 =\n\u03bb\u0304 (m1 , mV ; m\u03c6 );\nm2\u03c6\n2m2V\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 , f1 =\n\n1\nmV 2\n[1+\n\u03bb\u0304 (m1 , m2 ; mV ); V \u2192 V1 \u03c6, f6 =\n6\n3mV\n(m2V + m21 \u2212 m2\u03c6 )2\n];\n+\n8m2V m21\n\nV \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 , f5 =\n\n2\nm2 + m2 (m21 + m22 )2\nm1 m2\nV \u2192 \u03c8\u03041 \u03c82 , f7 = mV {c+ [1 \u2212 1 2 2 \u2212\n] + 3c\u2212\n};\n4\n3\n2mV\n2mV\nm2V\nV \u2192 V1 V2 , f8 =\n\nm5V\n[1 + 8(\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 ) \u2212 2(9\u03bc21 + 16\u03bc1\u03bc2 + 9\u03bc22 ) + 8(\u03bc31 \u2212\n2 2\n24m1 m2\n\n4\u03bc21 \u03bc2 \u2212 4\u03bc1 \u03bc22 + \u03bc32 ) + \u03bc41 + 8\u03bc31 \u03bc2 \u2212 18\u03bc21\u03bc22 + 8\u03bc1 \u03bc32 + \u03bc42 ], \u03bc1,2 = m21,2 /m2V ;\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c81 , f9 =\n\nm21 \u2212 m2\u03c6\nm\u03c8\nm1\n(1 + 2\n+\n);\n2\nm\u03c8\nm2\u03c8\n\n\u03c8 \u2192 V \u03c81 , f10 = m\u03c8 {c+ [\n\n(m2\u03c8 \u2212 m21 )2 m2\u03c8 + m21 \u2212 2m2V\nm1\n+\n};\n] \u2212 3c\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2m\u03c8 mV\n2m\u03c8\nm\u03c8\n\nc+ = c2V + c2A , c\u2212 + c2V \u2212 c2A .\n\n(B4)\n\nUsing the expressions (B1)\u2013(B4) we can represent \u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 \u03c63 ), that is the width of\nthe process \u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 R \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 \u03c63 , in a compact and universal form for all types of decay\nchannels. Here we shortly describe the method of calculation the width \u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 \u03c63 ).\nThis value always can be written as:\nk\n\u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 \u03c63 ) = 0\np\n\nZ\n\nJ(|M(ki , mi )|2 )\n\ndk1\n,\nk10\n\n(B5)\n\nwhere M(ki , mi ) is an amplitude, p and ki are momentum of \u03a6 and \u03c6i , k is some numerical\nfactor, and\n2\n\nJ(|M| ) =\n\nZ\n\n|M|2 \u03b4(p \u2212 k1 \u2212 k2 \u2212 k3 )\n\ndk2 dk3\n.\nk20 k30\n\n(B6)\n\nThe integral J(|M|2 ) is easily calculated in q = k2 + k3 = 0 frame of reference. As a result,\n21\n\n\fwe have the non-covariant expression\nJ(|M|2 ) \u2212\u2192 f (q 0 , q 0 p0 , q 0 k30 , p2 , ...).\n\n(B7)\n\nThis expression can be always reconstructed to covariant form by the transition (we use\nq = 0):\nq0 \u2192 q =\n\np\n(qq), q 0 p0 \u2192 (qp), q 0 k10 \u2192 (qk1 ), p\u03042 = (p0 )2 \u2212 m2 \u2192 (pq)2 /q 2 \u2212 m2 , ...\n\n(B8)\n\nThen we pass to the p = 0 frame of reference and change the variable in Eq.

Then for the simplest contact interaction we have:\ng2g2\n\u0393\u03a6 = 131 82 0\n2 \u03c0 p\n\nZ\n\ndk1\n0\nk1 |PR (q)|2\n\nZ Z Z\n\n\u03b4(q \u2212 k2 \u2212 k3 \u2212 k4 )\n\ndk2 dk3 dk4\n,\nk20 k30 k40\n\n(B15)\n\nwhere q = p \u2212 k1 . The width of the intermediate decay is\ng2\n\u0393R (q) \u2261 \u0393(R(q) \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 \u03c63 ) = 9 25 0\n2\u03c0 q\n\nZ Z Z\n\n\u03b4(q \u2212 k2 \u2212 k3 \u2212 k4 )\n\ndk2 dk3 dk4\n.\nk20 k30 k40\n\n(B16)\n\nFrom Eqs. (B15), (B16) with the help of (B2) and (B9) we get:\n\u0393\u03a6 =\n\nZ\n\nq22\n\ndq 2 \u0393\u03a6 (q)\n\nq12\n\nq\u0393R (q)\n,\n\u03c0|PR(q)|2\n\n(B17)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03a6 (q) \u2261 \u0393(\u03a6 \u2192 \u03c61 R(q)). Thus we have illustrated the validity of factorization in\nthe case of scalar UP. Using the factorable |M|2 , we can get the result (B17) by direct\ncalculations for others types of particles \u03c6k . It should be noted that the factored (B11) and\nconvolution (B13) structures are valid for any choice of PR (q).\nNow,we consider inelastic scattering of type ab \u2192 R \u2192 cd, where R is the UP with a large\nwidth in s-channel and a, b, c, d are stable (quasi-stable) particles of any kind. The vertexes\nare defined by the same Lagrangian (B1). In the further calculations it is convenient to\nemploy the relations, which take place in the center-of-mass system:\n1\nm2 \u2212 m2\n1\nm2 \u2212 m2\np01 = q[1 + a 2 b ], p02 = q[1 + b 2 a ],\n2\nq\n2\nq\n1\n1\n(p1 q) = (q 2 + m2a \u2212 m2b ), (p2 q) = (q 2 + m2b \u2212 m2a ),\n2\n2\n1\n1\n(p1 p2 ) = (q 2 \u2212 m2a \u2212 m2b ), |p1 | = |p2 | = q \u03bb\u0304(ma , mb ; q),\n2\n2\n23\n\n(B18)\n\n\fwhere p1 and p2 are the momenta of the particles a and b. The analogous relations occur\nfor the momenta k1 and k2 of the particles c and d. In Eqs.(B18) the symbol q has different\nmeanings in the expressions (p1 q), q = p1 + p2 (q is 4-momentum) and in the expression\np\nq[1 + f (q)], where q = (q * q) is a number.\nWith the help of the relations (B1)-(B4), (B18) and using above discussed expressions for\npropagators, we have got by tedious but straightforward calculations the universal factorized\ncross-section for all permissible combinations of particles (a, b, R, c, d):\n\u03c3(ab \u2192 R \u2192 cd) =\n\ncd\n\u0393ab\n16\u03c0(2JR + 1)\nR (s)\u0393R (s)\n\u221a\n.\n(2Ja + 1)(2Jb + 1)(2JR + 1)\u03bb\u03042 (ma , mb ; s) |PR (s)|2\n\n(B19)\n\nIn Eq.(B19) Jk is spin of the particle (k = a, b, R), s = (p1 + p2 )2 , \u0393ab\nR (s) = \u0393(R(s) \u2192 ab)\nand PR (s) is propagator's denominator of the UP or resonance R. The expressions for\ncd\n2\n2\n\u0393ab\nR (s) and \u0393R (s) follow from Eqs.(B2)-(B4), when squared mass of UP is mR = q = s.\n\nThe factorization of cross-section does not depend on the definition of PR (s), which can be\ndetermined in a phenomenological way, in Breit-Wigner or pole form , etc. The expression\n(B19) is a natural generalization of the spin-averaged Breit-Wigner (non-relativistic) crosssection, defined by the expression (37.51) in Ref.[14]. Note that the factorization is exact in\nour approach, while in the traditional one it occurs as an approximation.\n\n[1] J. D. Jackson, Nuovo Cimento 34, 1544 (1964).\n[2] J. Pisut, M. Roos, Nucl.
