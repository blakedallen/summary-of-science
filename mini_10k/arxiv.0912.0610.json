These include different densities and different usages, at least\nstandard operation mode and evacuation. Many tools for pedestrian planning are based on\ncellular automata (CA), discrete in space and time.\nIt is common experience that CA have problems with modelling sharp bends in wide corridors\nand especially with 180\u00b0 turns as they are frequent in staircases. They tend to move the\npedestrians to the innermost lanes far too strongly, thereby reducing the capacity. In the\nextreme, only a small fraction of the width will be used after the bend. There have been some\nremedies proposed, but a systematic investigation is lacking, and there is no accord on the\ncauses of the problem.\nIn the paper, we present a comparison of various implementations of CA - for treating 90\u00b0 and\n180\u00b0 bends with different width. We compare different models for the static floor field which\nprovides the persons orientation. We also indicate how a density dependant static floor field\ncan give a much increased capacity while still allowing single walkers to cut corners. We test\nat which position the walkers are most likely to get stuck and relate this to differences\nbetween CA models and real-world behaviour.\nThe behaviour in the model is compared with observation of people walking through a 90\u00b0\nbend in a corridor and walking down a wide staircase. It is shown that with a proper floor\nfield, at least the average behaviour of people can be simulated. Capturing the fluctuations\npresent in reality is beyond the capacity of the simple models investigated.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe last century has seen a tremendous growth of the world's population, together with an\nincreasing concentration of the population in big cities. Therefore, the safe and effective\norganisation of pedestrian facilities has gained in importance, as the crowds gathering in one\nplace (for ceremonies, entertainment, work or education) get more frequent and larger.\n\n\fBasic rules for planning of pedestrian facilities were obviously known to Greeks and Romans,\nas the quality of the egress routes e.g. at the theatre in Ephesus or the Coliseum in Rome\nwitnesses. Modern systematic planning began in the late 19th century with building\nregulations requiring a certain door width per number of people. These were motivated by\nsome catastrophic fires in theatres and ballrooms and aimed exclusively at safe emergency\negress [1]. As buildings - notably office buildings, which have much more complicated egress\nroutes than facilities for entertainment - became bigger, detailed planning became necessary,\nwhere the building egress was modelled as a tree or network of pathways that take time, but\nhave no active capacity restriction, and nodes (doors, junction of floors, etc), that do have\nactive capacity restrictions [2, 3, 4]. These models may be tedious to set up and use, but they\nallow reliable hand calculations of the time needed to clear a building and give predictions on\ncritical situations during evacuation. From building regulations and the performance based\negress analysis it follows that turns are not considered a problem there. This may be a reason\nthat no empirical data is available.\nStarting at ~1990, a modelling of the individual movement of all persons in a building was\nattempted, and the macroscopic picture became the sum of many local movements obeying\nsimple rules. There are two basic approaches: the cellular automata (CA) model where space\nand time are discrete and people are moving from one space element to another one according\nto some transition rules, and models in continuous space where persons are moved according\nto Newton's laws by forces generated mostly internally as a reaction to the desired momentary\ndestination and the local environment. While these are easier to use than the earlier models the time spend in pathways and the capacity of bottlenecks needs not be specified, it comes as\na result - the definition of the rules or forces is much more demanding, because small errors\nthere may build up to large errors in output quantities. There is up to now no full\nunderstanding how subtle differences in the modelling change the outcome, so these models\nhave to be tested further against each other and against reality in various situations. Part of\nthis has been done in [5]. We will test two further simple situations here - the walking around\na bend in a wide (>2m) corridor and the turning at the landing of a ramp or staircase \u2013\nbecause some simulations presented, unfortunately all unpublished - did not look very\nrealistic. Our aim is not to give the final answer to this modelling, but to investigate how\nchanges in guiding the persons in the simulation influence the outcome.\n1 CELLULAR AUTOMATA\nCellular automata are the most widely used approach. The commercial code\nPedGo [6] is a CA code; others (e.g. buildingEXODUS [7]) are based on rules for discrete\nhopping related to CA. They have demonstrated their ability to give good estimates of\nevacuation times of high rise buildings [5], while details may still need improvement. While\nthey differ in many aspects, the basics are identical.\n\n\f1.1 Introduction to the general theory\nThe principles of cellular automata for simulating pedestrians are explained in many places,\ne.g. [8,9]. For readability, we repeat here the description from [9]. The floor geometry is\ndiscretised into tiles, usually of 40cm by 40cm size. An initial distribution of persons on the\ntiles is defined. In every time step each person can move to another tile (or stay were he is)\naccording to a probability depending on\n\u2022 The availability of free space (only one person per tile at any time).\n\u2022 A (static) floor field describing the intended direction.\n\u2022 Possibly a (dynamic) floor field summarising the movement on the tile during the last\nfew time steps.\n\u2022 Personal data, describing e.g. handicaps.\nWith a time step of \u2248 0.3s this gives a reasonable speed of free movement of about 1.3m/s.\nThe static floor field S is usually (we will investigate a different construction, too) derived\nfrom the gradient of the distance to the destination (exit) in some metric, the Manhattan\nmetric being the most common one because it is extremely simple to implement even in\ncomplicated geometries. With this, the distance is simply the minimal number of tiles the\nperson has to pass before reaching the destination, and Sij for neighbouring cells can only take\nvalues -1, 0 and 1. For a person on tile i, the probability of movement to a neighbouring cell j\nis given by\npij = Ni exp (kSSij +kD Dij) (1-nj) \u03c7ij\n(1)\n\u2022 nj is the occupation number nj = 0|1 ,\n\u2022 \u03c7ij gives reachability of tile j from tile i, \u03c7ij = 0|1 ,\n\u2022 Sij is the static floor field weighted with a sensitivity parameter kS that may depend on\nthe person on tile i.\n\u2022 Dij is the dynamic floor field weighted with a sensitivity parameter kD, kD = 0 here.\n\u2022 Ni is the normalisation factor such that the sum of all probabilities for one person is 1:\nNi = 1 / \u2211 j (exp(kD Dij + kSSij) (1-nj) \u03c7ij ) .\nThe time step update may either be done in parallel with some conflict resolution, or\nsequential. To avoid directional bias and other artefacts in the sequential update, a random\norder changing from step to step is strongly recommended. The reachability factor \u03c7ij serves\ntwo purposes. It describes obstacles and walls as well as the choice of neighbourhood (Fig1).\nThe most common choice is the Neumann neighbourhood with 4 direct next neighbours, the\nMoore neighbourhood with 8 neighbours (diagonals included) is less common, others stepping over more than on cell in one time step \u2013 have also been investigated [10], but are\nnot used in production.\n\n\fFig 1: Places reachable with 4 and 8 direct neighbours\n1.2 The influence of the static floor field\nAs we only want to investigate the influence of the static floor field on the dynamics of\nwalking around a 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 turn, we keep the method as simple as possible otherwise, that\nis: No dynamic floor field, only the four direct neighbour cells are reachable, ks = 4 for all\npersons identical, random sequential update. Four different static floor fields Sij are compared:\n\u2022 F1: derived from the Manhattan distance,\n\u2022 F2: derived from the Euclidian distance,\n\u2022 F3: a field keeping the distance from the inner wall constant,\n\u2022 F4: a* F1 + (1-a) F3 with a=1/4.\nFor a simple straight corridor all fields are identical, and the capacity of such a corridor was\ntaken as reference. From the results of our studies a width of 5 tiles and a length of the inner\nwalls of twice the width were determined as critical. This shows all the effect of the floor\nfields, while with a smaller width these much are less pronounced. Actually, for width one all\nfloor fields are identical, and for width two the difference is not more than the normal scatter\nof the results. The measurements were arranged such that the space was filled quite dense,\nthen the walking was started. Every person reaching the end of the corridor was entered at the\nbeginning again in a random position if there was space available, if not he was assigned a\nwaiting position. After a short initial phase, long enough to reach a stationary state, the\nmeasurement was started. Tests showed that the number of persons inside the corridor stayed\nfairly constant, and that the flow obtained thus increased monotonously with the number of\npersons initialised up to a maximum depending on the floor field chosen.\nWidth of 5 tiles\nCorridor type Static field\ntype\nstraight\n\nFlow per\ntime step\n\nWidth of 10 tiles\n\nPers.

This shows that with floor fields F1\nand F2, the turns are strong bottlenecks. Even worse, a wider floor has hardly more capacity.\nThis is definitely not in agreement with everyday observations, even if they cannot be\nquantified. With floor field F3, the capacity of the turn is more than 90% of the capacity of a\nstraight corridor, which may be true, but seems optimistic. Floor field F4 shows that a linear\ncombination of field F3 and field F1 can be tuned to give the proper result.\nBeyond the capacity figures, the simulation can analyse the movement patterns. For a 90\u00b0 turn\nand floor fields F1 and F3 we show a typical snapshot and the distribution of occupation and\nmovement over time. From the snapshot (Fig. 2) it can be seen that for field F1 the inner\nlanes before the first curve are blocked by persons turning in from outer lanes (the result from\nfield F2 looks almost the same), while with field F3 the outer lanes take a wider curve and the\ninner lanes move fairly un-obstructed.\n\n\fFig. 2 Shnapshots of movement with field F1 (left) and F3 (right).\n+ indicates standing, an arrowhead indicates motion\n\nThere is always a small percentage of people not moving, this is typical for CA modelling as\nthe probability for not moving is 1/Ni, which depends on KS. It is also clear from the\nprocedure of refeeding people into the system that the cells at the entrance are always\noccupied and therefore there is not much free movement near the entrance.\n1\nCONTINUOUS SPACE MODELS\nThe description of pedestrians as (mostly) self-driven particles walking in continuous space\nand time due to forces they generate themselves from the desire to reach some destination and\nto avoid collisions (plus forces from pushing in very dense crowds) can give more realistic\nindividual movements than CA methods, but are much more demanding and (probably as a\nconsequence) not as widely used. There are completely different proposals for the\nspecification of these forces [11, 12], and the models are mostly in an experimental state.\n1.1 The social force model\nThe social force model (SFM,[11,13,14)is the oldest and most matured of the SDP models,\nand it will be used here. In its original version it is intended for qualitative rather than\nquantitative phenomena and thus gave some inside into self-organisation of pedestrian flows\nrather than numbers on evacuation times. This is sufficient for the present purpose. It has been\ndeveloped into a quantitative method [15], but this is a commercial product and details are not\navailable.\nThe social force model assumes a Force F as sum of an accelerating force F a proportional to the\ndifference between the desired and the present velocity, an influence of other people F r given by the\nsum of binary person-person interactions F i,j which are derived from an exponential potential, plus\nwall forces F W similar to F r. The simplest (original) form depends on distance only.\n\n\fFig. 3 Summary of movement with field F1 (left) and F3 (right).\nOpen diamonds give occupation, closed diamonds inside occupation by people standing still\n\nF = Fa + F r + F w ;\nFa = (v0 -v)/\u03b1,\nv0 the desired velocity,\n\u03b1 \u2248 1.6\n(3)\nFr = \u2211 j Fi,j ; Fi,j = C exp (-\u03bb || xi \u2013x j || ) , here \u03bb = 0.3, C = 7.3\n(4)\nIt gives a decent agreement for the trajectories, but lane formation is much too strong.\n\nFig. 4 Tracks from Social force model with one intermediate and one final destination line\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nEXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS\nExperiments have been performed for various situations within the context of the Hermes\nproject [16] just recently and will be analysed in detail, but at the moment only summery data\nis available. The experiments have been recorded by stereo wide angle overhead cameras, and\nthe transformation of the raw camera data into trajectories needs some effort. There has been\nsome recording with standard cameras, too. From these, the software PetTrack [17] can\nproduce trajectories of moderate accuracy using the (invalid) assumption that all persons are\nof the same size. However, these cameras cover only a small part of the floor, so they do not\ngive all the data needed for a good comparison.\n3.1 Walking round a corner\nThe experiments have been recorded on video using two pairs of wide angle stereo cameras\n\nFig. 4 Experimental setup for walking round a corner\n\nwhich together cover the total region and one standard camera covering the central region\nonly. Stereo cameras are used such that the height of people's heads is known and thus\naccurate trajectories are obtained. Otherwise the perspective distortion cannot be handled\ncorrectly. Unfortunately, the stereo camera pictures come in a non-standard data format and\nhave not been transformed yet, so only the standard camera data is available, and only for one\n(the most interesting) width (2.4m). All data will be available by the end of 2009. For\ncalculation of positions we assumed everybody to be 180 cm tall, which introduces positional\nerrors of about 10 cm. The trajectories show that the people cut the corner a bit, but behind\nthe corner they basically regain their former distance from the inner wall. Grouping these\ndistances by cells of 40 cm width, the numbers for the cells from inner to outer were 0, 14, 24,\n18, 7, 1 going in and 0, 24, 21, 14, 5, 0 going out. This is a weak tendency for moving to the\ninside, similar to the CA model with floor field F4. On the other hand, the fact that the\ninnermost lane is not used at all, which may have to do with the fact that in case of\nbidirectional traffic this would be dangerous at the corner, is not captured by any floor field.\n\n\fFig 5. Trajectories of people walking round a corner (the walls are longer than shown)\n\nObviously, the corridor is not used to capacity, and everybody keeps away from the walls. The\naverage flux is 1.25 persons per second. From other experiments [18] we know that the entrance to a\ncorridor is the actual bottleneck, while over the length of the corridor speed increases and density\ndrops. The effect of the 90\u00b0 turn is obviously too small to fill the corridor again.\n\n3.2 Walking down a staircase\nThe experiments on a staircase of 2.4 m width were documented on video, but for this the\ncalculation of positions from the video is not available yet. Therefore, only the most obvious\nobservations are reported. The experiments differ from the CA calculations in that the\nlandings are not rectangular but semi-circular. Again, the entering of the staircase was the\nproblem, afterwards the density decreased and the descend was almost unobstructed. Even\nthree stories down, after 5 turns of 180\u00b0, people would occasionally walk four abreast, even\nthough on average the inner part of the stairs was preferred. There was no indication of any\nobstruction caused by the turning. This may, however, be due to the fact that the stairs have\n\n\fFig. 6 Snapshot and summary of cell occupation for experiment\n\nlower specific capacity than the level ground, and additionally the entering of the stairs is\neven more restricted, so that a moderate obstruction would pass unnoticed. Walking upstairs\nshows the same picture, the turn at the landings being no bottleneck. Here the capacity of the\nstaircase is even more restricted.\n\nFig. 4 Experiments walking up and down the staircase\n\n\f4 CONCLUSIONS\nFor the situation inspected here, the conventional floor field for a cellular automata approach makes\n90\u00b0 corners in wide floors appear as bottlenecks for the egress. This feature is just visible for floors 3\nlanes (1.2m) wide and becomes more pronounced and quite unrealistic for floors wider than 2m. A\nsmall modification of the floor field, the addition of a wall parallel field, changes this behaviour such\nthat bends have an egress capacity not much lower than straight corridors of the same width. This\nchange does not increase the computing time or complexity. There are other attempts to solve the\nsame problem, like introducing dynamic floor fields [9] or some local optimization [17] to people, but\nthese add considerably to the computational complexity.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank M.
