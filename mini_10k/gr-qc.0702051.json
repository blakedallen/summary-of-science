The spurious accelerations linked to random thermal fluctuations have\nbeen allocated one-third of this total budget for meeting the desired LISA sensitivity\n[4]. Thermal fluctuations on the electrode housing of the GRS are estimated to be\nS\u2206T = 10\u221210 K2 /Hz [2], which combined with\n\u221a theoretical understanding of the thermal\n2\n\u221216\neffects yields \u03b4 aT = 3.5 \u00d7 10 (m/s )/ Hz, which is one-third of the allocation.\nThe margin in the budget that this assessment creates could be used to relax other\nrequirements. Therefore it is imperative that the models which were used to generate\nthe current assessment are validated in a laboratory setting.\nThe three largest thermal effects in the LISA noise budget are radiation pressure, the\nradiometer effect, and asymmetric outgassing. These three terms add coherently: [5, 6]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n8\u03c3\nA P AGQ0 \u0398 p\n3\nAT + \u03b1P\n+\n\u03b4 aT =\nS\u2206T ,\n(1)\n3Mc\n2M T\n4M T 2\n\n\fwhere \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, M = 1.96 kg is the\nmass of the LISA proof mass, A = 2.12 \u00d7 10\u22123 m2 is the area of one face of the LISA\nproof mass, P = 10\u22125 Pa is the residual gas pressure at the proof mass, and T = 293 K is\nthe temperature. The first term in Equation 1 is due to fluctuating asymmetric radiation\npressure, \u03b4 aRP . The second term is due to the radiometer effect, \u03b4 aRE . The pressures on\nopposite faces of the proof mass equilibrate quickly so that there is nearly no pressure\ndifference across it. This implies that the contribution due to the radiometer effect should\nbe reduced [7]. Leading to a pressure reduction factor of \u03b1P \u2248 0.1 [8]. The last term\nis due to fluctuations in asymmetric outgassing on opposite sides of the proof mass.\nThe outgassing rate Q(T ) most likely will follow an exponential law in temperature\nreferenced to an activation temperature \u0398. The value of this activation temperature\nshould be no more than 30000 K [3]. The value for the nominal outgassing rate is taken\nto be Q0 \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u221210 Torr L cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22127 kg/s3 [5]. The factor, G, is related to\ngas particle conductances about the proof mass and through holes in the housing walls,\nand to the outgassing area of the proof mass. The nominal value for LISA is G = 0.4 m/s\n[5].\nThe derivations of these three effects were made assuming a constant temperature\ngradient across the housing which is then varied. This implies that the three effects\ndescribed above are dependent on the\u221afrequency of fluctuations only through the level of\nthe thermal fluctuations themselves, S\u2206T .\nOur apparatus provides the unique opportunity to investigate the gap spacing dependence as well as the pressure and linearity of the thermal effects. Our results are complimentary to those that have been presented by the University of Trento group [6, 9].\nWhereas they have designed a mock-up of the LISA proof mass and electrode housing\nand therefore emulate the geometry of LISA, we have an increased torque sensitivity, the\nability to change the gap spacing, and a simpler geometry which allows ease in modeling\n[10].\n\nTORSION BALANCE APPARATUS\nOur torsion balance apparatus is described in [10]. Each of the two halves of the copper\nplate has embedded a heating element and a temperature sensor. Further temperature\nsensors are located on the plate translation stage, near the control electrodes, on the\nautocollimator, on the outside of our vacuum chamber, on the inside of the styrofoam\nenclosure, and the temperature controlled laboratory.\nWe predict values for the three thermal noise sources under study for our torsion balance tests. Since our torsion pendulum measures torques we must convert the measured\ntorques into LISA-equivalent accelerations. As mentioned in [10], this conversion is\ndone by using a moment arm at which the spurious forces act on the pendulum and the\nmass of one LISA proof mass. The base pressure of our experiment is \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa.\nWe assume that the outgassing activation temperature and the outgassing rate of copper\nis similar to that assumed for the LISA GRS. The cross-sectional area overlap of one half\nof the copper plate and our pendulum is AUW = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 m2 . The gas conductance rate\nfor our setup should be similar in value to those for the LISA GRS, likewise we assume\nthe same value for the factor G. Note that simple gas dynamics implies that the conduc-\n\n\fTABLE 1.

The low and high pressure data were computed with base pressures\u221aof 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa and\n1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa respectively.

In this table we have computed\nour LISA-equivalent noise levels when the mean temperature of the copper plate in\nour apparatus is 298 K and when it is 301 K. From \u221a\nthese values we predict a thermally\ninduced acceleration noise of 3 \u00d7 10\u221211 (m/s2/K) S\u2206T relatively independent of the\ntemperature of the copper plate. In addition, we show values for the system at an elevated\npressure of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa, for which we expect an increase by nearly a factor of 2.\nWe present our results in terms of a thermal-to-torque transfer function. The conversion from torque to LISA-equivalent acceleration is \u2248 15 (m/s2 )/(Nm), such that the\nexpected thermal-to-torque transfer function should be 2 \u00d7 10\u221212 Nm/K when the system is at low pressure, and about 4 \u00d7 10\u221212 Nm/K for the high pressure scenario.\nThe copper plate reached 35\u25e6 during the two day mild bakeout of our apparatus under\nvacuum. Our measurements were made 150 days after this bakeout occurred. The copper\nplate is made of oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper, which has an outgassing\nrate 10 times lower than that assumed in the above calculations [11].\n\nTHERMAL MEASUREMENTS\nThe temperature difference between the two halves of the copper plate emulates a\ntemperature gradient across the LISA proof mass. Our procedure is to vary this gradient\nrecording the torque, thereby the LISA-equivalent acceleration, as a function of a variety\nof adjustable variables, such as the temperature gradient, the mean temperature of the\ncopper plate, the plate-pendulum separation, and the residual gas pressure inside our\napparatus.\n\nDC Measurements\nApplying constant power to the heater in either the left or right section of the copper\nplate shows a linear rise in temperature of that half as well as a linear response of\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Heating of one half of the copper plate (left) followed by heating of the other half some\ntime later (right) in equals steps of heater output power. The top chart shows the temperature of each half\nof the copper plate as well as the mean temperature all in \u25e6 C, the middle chart shows the temperature\ngradient between the two halves in K, and the lower chart shows the measured torque on the pendulum.\nThe plate-pendulum separation for this data was 1 mm.\n\nthe torque on the pendulum. Figure 1 shows heating of half of the copper plate in\nconstant steps of heater power. This data was taken with a plate-pendulum separation\nof 1 mm. The heated half changes by about 0.76 K over the course of this data set.\nThermal coupling from one half of the copper plate to the other is \u223c30% such that\nthe other half gained 0.23 K. The temperature sensor placed on the electrode side of\nthe apparatus (inside the vacuum chamber) rose by 47 mK over the course of this data\nset. Temperature sensors attached to the outside of the vacuum chamber changed in\ntemperature by \u223c46 mK. The temperature of the styrofoam enclosure did not change\nappreciably. This indicates that the thermal feedthrough from the copper plate to the\napparatus is on the order of 10%.\nIt can be seen from the slower rise in the torque as compared with the temperature\ngradient that there is a delay between the temperature gradient and the reaction of\nthe feedback loop of \u223c1700 s. We suspect that this delay may be due to an effective\nactivation time of outgassing: the trapped gas at the surface of the copper immediately\nescapes whereas the trapped gas within the copper slowly diffuses. Additionally, transfer\nof heat to the pendulum should raise the pendulum temperature by a fraction of the plate\ntemperature change. The heating of the pendulum should increase outgassing from the\nsilicon. There is a delay between the heating of the copper plate and the heating of the\npendulum leading to a delayed response in the feedback torque.\n\n\fThe temperature gradient between the two halves of the split copper plate is the\nimportant quantity under investigation. The change in temperature gradient makes a\nchange in all three thermal sources under investigation. This causes a pronounced change\nin the torque. The thermal-to-torque transfer function for the data on the left in Figure 1\nis about 2.3 pNm/K.\nAfter some time we heated the other half of the copper plate and brought the temperature gradient back to nearly zero. This data is on the right in Figure 1. The thermalto-torque transfer function for this data is 3.0 pNm/K. Notice that the mean temperature\nof the copper plate in the data on right is \u223c1.5 K higher than the data on the left. This\nincrease in the transfer function appears to be a function of the mean temperature of the\ncopper plate as described in more detail below.\n\nAC Measurements\nThe important frequency band of thermal measurements for LISA is from 0.1 to\n1 mHz. Looking at coherent signals allows us to determine the thermal frequency response of our system. By sweeping in frequency from 0.1 to 1 mHz we can map the\ntransfer function from thermal input to torque output. Figure 2 contains data for such a\nfrequency sweep at two mean plate temperatures and two gas pressures. This data was\ntaken with a plate-pendulum separation of 1 mm.\nThe thermal mass of the copper plate creates a low pass filter so that the temperature\ngradient amplitude is smaller at higher frequencies. Our typical amplitude is nearly\n200 mK at 0.1 mHz. From a series of measurements we found that the thermal-totorque response is independent of the signal amplitude at any particular frequency [12].\nHowever, we still observe an apparent low pass response with a corner frequency near\n0.1 mHz and a slope index of \u22120.75 in amplitude.\nFrom our DC measurements we found a time delay between the temperature gradient\nand the control torque of about 1700 s. At 10 \u03bc Hz this would be a phase delay of\n\u221218\u25e6 which is in good agreement with the data presented in Figure 2. This phase\ndelay becomes larger for frequencies above 1 mHz following the decrease in transfer\nfunction. However, it appears to turn around at higher frequencies. We suspect this is an\nexperimental artifact due to electrical coupling in our system.\nTo verify that this frequency and phase dependence was not dependent on our frequency sweeping function, we used a variety of different sweep functions, such as linear,\nlogarithmic, and more complicated functions of time, as well as monochromatic sinusoids. We found no dependence on the sweep function. The individual data points in\nFigure 2 are for fixed-frequency sine waves.\n\nDISCUSSION\nWhen the mean temperature of the copper plate is elevated by a few degrees we see an\nincrease in the thermal-to-torque transfer function, which is not predicted by Table 1. An\nincrease in the outgassing rate is likely the cause. As mentioned above, it is also possible\nthat the pendulum is appreciably changing in temperature such that the outgassing rate\n\n\fFIGURE 2. Thermal-to-torque transfer function and phase delay for thermal frequency sweeps between\n30 \u03bc Hz and 1 mHz. The solid (dashed) transfer function traces were taken at a base pressure of 1.2 \u00d7\n10\u22125 Pa (1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa). Raising the gas pressure increased the transfer function by a factor of 13. Raising\nthe mean temperature of the copper plate by 3 K raised the transfer function by a factor of 1.5 irregardless\nof the gas pressure in our apparatus.\n\nfrom the silicon increases as well. The outgassing rate should decay with time as a power\nlaw [11, 13]. Observing this decay would yield support for this hypothesis.\nThe radiometer effect is linearly proportional to the gas pressure in the system.\nFigure 2 contains thermal-to-torque traces at an elevated pressure of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa.\nThe thermal-to-torque transfer function at frequencies above 0.1 mHz appears to be a\nfactor of 13 higher when the system is at this higher pressure. This linear response is\nexactly expected for the radiometer effect, if the radiometer effect accounted for the\nbulk of the thermal-to-torque transfer. As demonstrated in Table 1, the radiometer effect\nshould be a small contribution to the total. The three contributing thermal effects add\nlinearly since they are coherent in the temperature gradient. If outgassing and radiation\npressure are independent of gas pressure, then the increase in the transfer function when\nthe system is at high pressure would be due to the radiometer effect. This would imply\nthat the radiometer effect is accounting for the bulk of the transfer, and therefore is a\nfactor of 15 higher than anticipated, i.e., the pressure reduction factor, \u03b1P , should be an\namplification of 1.5 not a reduction of 10. However, the radiometer effect is inversely\nproportional to the mean temperature and therefore does not account for the increase of\n1.5 when the copper plate is at an elevated temperature.\nIf instead outgassing is the cause of the increase when the system is warm, then the\noutgassing contribution must also increase when the system is at an elevated pressure\nwhich is currently not included in the LISA models [5].\n\n\fDIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY\nOur results are reasonably consistent with the current theoretical understanding of the\nthermal effects used in modeling for the LISA GRS. However, there does remain an\nanomalous increase in the thermal-to-torque transfer function when the copper plate is\nheated by a small amount regardless of base pressure. We are currently conducting measurements to help explain this. In addition, we are in the process of making measurements over a range of plate-pendulum separations to determine the distance dependence\nof the thermal effects.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank the members of E\u00f6t-Wash and the Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Washington for infrastructure.
