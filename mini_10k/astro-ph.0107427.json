The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) is a ground-based instrument designed to study astrophysical sources of gamma radiation in\nthe energy range of 50 to 500 GeV. STACEE uses an array of\nlarge heliostat mirrors at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. The heliostats are\nused to collect Cherenkov light produced in \u03b3-ray air showers. The light is concentrated onto an array of photomultiplier tubes located near the top of a tower. The construction\nof STACEE started in 1997 and has been completed in 2001.\nDuring the 1998-99 observing season, we used a portion of\nthe experiment, STACEE-32, to detect \u03b3-rays from the Crab\nNebula. The completed version of STACEE uses 64 heliostat\nmirrors, having a total collection area of 2300 m2 . During\nthe last year, we have also installed custom electronics for\npulse delay and triggering, and 1 GHz Flash ADCs to read\nout the photomultiplier tubes. The commissioning of the full\nSTACEE instrument is underway. Preliminary observations\nand simulation work indicate that STACEE will have an energy threshold below 70 GeV and a reach for extragalactic\n\u03b3-ray sources out to redshift of \u223c1.0. In this paper we describe the design and performance of STACEE.\n\n1\n\nOverview\n\nSTACEE (The Solar Tower Atmospheric Effect Experiment)\nis a new experiment constructed for ground-based gammaray astrophysics. STACEE detects \u03b3-rays via the atmospheric Cherenkov radiation produced in extensive air showers. STACEE uses 64 large solar mirrors (heliostats) as the\nprimary collector of Cherenkov photons. This very large collection area allows STACEE to probe a region of \u03b3-ray energies (50-500 GeV) not yet explored by previous imaging\nCherenkov instruments.\nSTACEE is located at the National Solar Thermal Test\nFacility (NSTTF) at Sandia National Laboratories in AlbuCorrespondence to: covault@hep.uchicago.edu\n\nFig. 1. Aerial view of National Solar Tower Test Facility at Sandia\nNational Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.\n\nquerque, New Mexico, USA (see Figure 1). STACEE is one\nof four solar-tower Cherenkov experiments that are currently\nin operation or under development. These include the French\nCELESTE experiment in the Pyrenees (La Gallou, 2001) the\nSpanish/German GRAAL experiment (Arqueros, 1999) and\nthe Solar Two Gamma-Ray Observatory near Barstow, California (Zweerink, 1999).\nThe STACEE experiment has been built in stages, with\neach stage using progressively more heliostats and progressively improved optics and electronics all of which are incorporated in the final STACEE experiment that is now complete. Figure 2 shows a plan view of the heliostats at the\nNSTTF used for each stage of the STACEE experiment. The\nstages of construction are delineated as follows:\n. STACEE-32: Construction on STACEE began in 1997. By October of 1998 we commissioned a partially complete system with\ntwo secondary mirrors and 32 heliostats called STACEE-32. During the 1998-1999 observing seasons, we operated STACEE-32 to\nmeasure instrument performance and to conduct initial observations\n\n\f2\ncal throughput. To obtain the best throughput possible,\nwe have developed a precise algorithm for setting facet\nheadings using lasers and a telescope. Individual facet\nheadings are now determined with an accuracy corresponding to <\n\u223c20 cm of movement of the heliostat spot\nat the position of the secondary mirror.\n\u2013 A set of alignment lasers has been mounted at key positions on the optical structures on the tower to verify\nand monitor the optical alignment of secondary mirrors and cameras. Individual PMT positions are now\nverified monthly using a CCD camera and moonlight.\nWe have also used moonlight to directly determine the\nproper bias (offset) heading for each heliostat to obtain\nmaximum light throughput.\n\u2013 To reduce background light due to reflected albedo, the\nasphalt field beneath the heliostats was coated by a dark\nblack sealant. This coating reduced the albedo by up to\n50%.\n\nFig. 2. Plan view of NSTTF showing heliostats used for STACEE.\nSTACEE-32 used the East and West Cameras; STACEE-48 used the\nEast, West, and North Cameras.\n\nof gamma-ray sources. These results have been reported elsewhere\n(Ong, 2000; Covault, 2000). In particular, we observed the Crab\nnebula and pulsar between December 1998 and March 1999 with\nSTACEE-32. We detected the Crab with high statistical significance\n(seven standard deviations) at an energy of threshold of 190 \u00b1 60\nGeV. This detection represents the first astrophysical results from\nSTACEE (Oser, 2001) and demonstrated the viability of the instrument concept.\n. STACEE-48: A second stage of the partially completed STACEE\ninstrument was constructed during 1999 and 2000, with 48 heliostat channels active. In addition, several key improvements were\nmade to the optics and electronics (see below). STACEE-48 has\nbeen operating as a gamma-ray observatory since November 2000.\nSources observed thus far with STACEE-48 include Markarian 421,\nwhich has been detected by STACEE with high significance (Hinton, 2001), and Markarian 501 (Ong, 2001).\n. STACEE: Construction of the full STACEE instrument with 64\nheliostat channels and five secondary mirrors is now complete. Regular operation of the completed STACEE experiment as a gammaray observatory is expected to commence by Fall, 2001. At this\npoint STACEE will operate continuously for several years (Ong,\n2001).\n\n2\n\nCompletion of the STACEE instrument\n\nDuring the last two years, we have worked on the completion\nof the STACEE instrument. We carried out the following\ntasks:\n\u2013 We have learned that the alignment of the heliostat\nfacets is an important consideration for the overall opti-\n\n\u2013 An infrared cloud monitor and an optical photometer\n(which tracks a star close to the STACEE field of view)\nare being commissioned to work along with STACEE.\nDuring the last two years, we have also made a push to\ninstall the final STACEE electronics. This work included the\ninstallation and integration of additional trigger electronics\nto support all 64 PMT channels. We have designed and installed a custom dynamic delay and trigger system, based\nin VME using FPGA technology (Martin and Ragan, 2000).\nThe system features delays programmable in 1-nsec steps\nover a one-microsecond range and a two-level multiplicity\ntrigger with an adjustable trigger coincidence gate (currently\nset at 12 nsec). The trigger system keeps a record of hits on\neach channel for the 32 nsec window surrounding a trigger,\nwith a 1 nsec accuracy.\nWe have also completed the installation of high speed (1\nGHz) 8-bit FADCs to digitize signals from the PMT channels. These state-of-the-art digitizers (Acqiris DC270) provide the accurate time and amplitude measurements necessary for complete shower reconstruction. Improved shower\nreconstruction will help STACEE achieve a better angular\nresolution and gamma/hadron separation (and hence sensitivity).\nFigure 3 shows a schematic of the electronics for\nSTACEE. The FADCs measure the analog pulse of each\nPMT channel to determine its time-of-arrival and amplitude.\nThey also measure the instantaneous night sky background\nbefore and after the Cherenkov signals. The FADCs serve as\nan analog pipeline to buffer the PMT information while the\ntrigger decision is being made. Conventional multi-hit TDCs\nare used for verification of the pulse timing.\nThe FADCs used by STACEE are packaged in a 4-channel\ncompact-PCI (cPCI) board, and are controlled using a realtime Linux-based DAQ that operates in conjunction with\nthe VME-based trigger system. STACEE personnel developed and implemented the entire suite of software required\n\n\fPMT\n\n3\n\nDAQ\nand\ncontrol\n\nHV\n\nx100\n\nAcqiris Digitizers:\n1GHz FADC\n(cPCI\u2212Bus)\nVME\nscaler\n\nDiscriminator\n\nGPS\n\n64 Channels In\n\nTrigger Delay Unit:\n\u2212 Digital pipeline\n\u2212 Programmable digital delay\n\u2212 Multilevel coincidence trigger\n\nTrigger\n\n(VME)\n\nFig. 3. Schematic of STACEE electronics, including the new delay/trigger circuitry and the Acqiris digitizers.\n\nfor the DAQ, including the kernel-based device driver; this\nwork was necessary because the base drivers written for Windows NT would have unacceptable dead-time. A full crate of\nFADCs to provide readout for 48 PMT channels has been installed, and the commissioning tests indicate that we will be\nable to readout the FADCs with a very small dead-time (\u223c2\nms/event, as compared to \u223c10 ms/event for the VME portion\nof the DAQ). The raw data taken by the FADCs is fully integrated into the standard STACEE analysis chain, and during\nthe summer we will finalize the reconstruction algorithms to\nprovide robust estimates of the pulse amplitude and time.\n\n3\n\nRecent performance results from STACEE-48\n\nA concerted effort is underway to characterize the detector\nperformance. These studies are based upon in situ calibration, Monte Carlo simulation, and the analysis of data taken.\nEvent reconstruction parameters, in particular, angular reconstruction and energy determination, are primarily determined from the arrival times and pulse amplitudes of the\nCherenkov signal seen at each heliostat. Thus, calibrating\nand characterizing STACEE's timing resolution and optical\nresponse is critical. Here we present some of the results that\nhave been obtained thus far in this effort.\nWe have developed an initial reconstruction scheme that is\napplied to the STACEE Cherenkov data. To reconstruct the\narrival direction of an incoming shower, the times recorded\nby the TDCs (after calibration and trims are applied) are fit\nto a spherical shape. Figure 4 shows a plot of the timing\nresiduals on one channel after best fit spherical wavefront re-\n\nFig. 4. Timing residuals on a single STACEE channel relative to\nbest-fit spherical wavefront reconstruction. The RMS of this distribution is 1.2 ns, indicating that STACEE is achieving excellent time\nresolution.\n\nconstruction. The residual width of \u223c1 ns is at the level predicted by simulation indicating that the timing measurement\nfrom any one channel is primarily limited by the intrinsic\nfluctuations in the shower.\nWe obtain an estimate of the pointing accuracy of\nSTACEE by dividing the array into two overlapping subarrays and using each sub-array to reconstruct the arrival direction separately. The angular difference between the reconstructed directions from the sub-arrays, as shown in Figure 5,\nis a measure of the intrinsic angular resolution (modulo a statistical correction factor). From this study we determine an\no\nangular resolution of <\n\u223c0.2 , which agrees with simulation\nand the design value. Figure 5 also shows the reduced \u03c72\ndistribution for the goodness-of-fit to a spherical wavefront.\nAnother key indicator of detector performance is the trigger rate versus discriminator threshold curve which provides\na good measure of the effective operating threshold of the experiment. Figure 6 shows this curve for STACEE-48 observing cosmic rays coming from the zenith. Using this data, we\ncan set the operating threshold at the lowest possible value\nthat ensures a negligible contribution to the rate from accidental triggers on night-sky noise. We note that for STACEE48, the usable threshold is constrained by the intrinsic limit\nof 16 hits per channel on multi-hit TDCs and by deadtime\nassociated with individual discriminators. The recent installation of FADCs will allow us to run STACEE at the lowest\npossible trigger threshold, which translates into the lowest\npossible energy threshold.\nFinally, work is in progress to compare in detail results\nfrom simulations against data collected by the experiment to\ndetermine energy threshold. We use the CORSIKA package\nto simulate air showers (Heck, 1998). Figure 7 shows the\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 5.

Our preliminary estimate of the energy threshold\nis 120 \u00b1 25 GeV at zenith for observations made in Winter/Spring\n2001. This energy threshold is appropriate for observations made\nwith a 145 mV PMT threshold, well above the threshold where the\nrate of accidental triggers becomes neglibible.\n\n-1\n\nReferences\n60\n\n85\n\n110\n135\nPMT Threshold (mV)\n\n160\n\nFig. 6. Trigger rate versus discriminator threshold for STACEE48. The black squares indicate the response of the experiment with\nchannel delays set in-time for Cherenkov triggers. The open circles, taken with delays times scrambled, represent the rate due to\naccidental triggers on the night sky background. The turnover at\nrates above 100 Hz is due to DAQ deadtime. Above a threshold\nof 120 mV, the experiment operates with Cherenkov rate >\n\u223c7.5 Hz\nand with negligible accidental background. For comparison, one\nphoto-electron corresponds to \u223c25 mV.\n\nArqueros, F., et al., Proc. 26th ICRC, Salt Lake City, 5, 215, 1999.\nCovault, C.E. et al., Towards a Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Detector VI: (Snowbird, UT) conf. proc.
