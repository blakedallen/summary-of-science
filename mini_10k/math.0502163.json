The volume conjecture. The Volume Conjecture (in short, VC) connects two very different approaches to knot theory, namely Topological Quantum Field Theory and Riemannian (mostly Hyperbolic)\nGeometry.\nIn its fundamental form, the VC states that for every hyperbolic knot K in S 3 we have:\n(1)\n\n1\nlog |ev1,n (JK (n))|\n=\nVK ,\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\n2\u03c0\nlim\n\nwhere\n\u2022 ev\u03b1,n (f ) denotes the evaluation of a rational function f (q) at q = e2\u03c0i\u03b1/n ,\n\u2022 JK (n) \u2208 Z[q \u00b1 ] is the Jones polynomial of a knot colored with the n-dimensional irreducible representation of sl2 , normalized so that it equals to 1 for the unknot (see [J, Tu]), and\n\u2022 VK is the volume of the knot complement S 3 \u2212 K, using the unique complete hyperbolic metric;\n[Th].\nThe VC was formulated in this form by H. and J. Murakami [MM], who reinterpreted an earlier version due\nto Kashaev, [K].\nIt is natural to ask what happens when we use evaluations ev\u03b1,n of the colored Jones polynomial for other\ncomplex numbers \u03b1. In [Gu], Gukov proposed a Generalized Volume Conjecture (in short, GVC), which\nstates that for every hyperbolic knot K in S 3 and every irrational \u03b1 near 1 (or \u03b1 = 1), we have:\n(2)\n\nlog |ev\u03b1,n (JK (n))|\n1\n=\nVK (1/\u03b1),\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\n2\u03c0\nlim\n\nwhere\n\u2022 VK (1/\u03b1) is the volume of the (1/\u03b1, 0) Dehn filling of the knot complement S 3 \u2212 K (that is, the Dehn\nfilling corresponding to M 2\u03c0i\u03b1 L0 = 1 where (M, L) is the meridian and longitude of the knot); see\n[Th].\nThe GVC is mostly about hyperbolic knots and hyperbolic Dehn fillings. In case a manifold (with or without\nboundary) is not hyperbolic, we will declare its corresponding Gromov-Thurston volume to be zero.\nThere are two rather independent parts in the GVC:\n(a) To show that the limit exists in (2),\n(b) To identify the limit with the volume of the corresponding Dehn filling.\nAt the moment, the GVC is known for the 41 knot and certain values of \u03b1; see Murakami, [M1].\nIn the following, we will refer to the parameter \u03b1 in the GVC as the angle, making contact with standard\nterminology from hyperbolic geometry.\nOne may further ask what happens to the GVC when the angle \u03b1 is small. For example, when \u03b1 = 0,\nthen ev0,n (JK (n)) = 1 for all knots K and integers n, thus the corresponding limit on the left hand side of\n(2) vanishes. To attach a meaning to the right hand side of (2), we need to use the volume of an appropriate\nSL2 (C) representation of the knot complement. Unfortunately, for small angles \u03b1, the corresponding Dehn\nfillings are not hyperbolic. But fortunately, there is a natural SL2 (C) representation to consider when \u03b1 = 0,\nnamely the trivial one. This is in agreement with physics, where the case \u03b1 = 0 is a classical limit of a\nquantum theory, and corresponds to the only SL2 (C) flat connection on S 3 , namely the trivial one. When\n\u03b1 is small and real, we will define VK (1/\u03b1, 0) to be the volume of the reducible SL2 (C) representation\n\u0012 2\u03c0i\u03b1/n\n\u0013\ne\n0\n3\n\u03c1\u03b1 : \u03c01 (S \u2212 K) \u2212\u2192 SL2 (C),\n\u03c1\u03b1 (M) =\n.\n0\ne\u22122\u03c0i\u03b1/n\n(where M is a meridian). A simple calculation shows that VK (1/\u03b1, 0) = 0 for \u03b1 small and positive.\nNow, we can formulate the GVC for small positive angles \u03b1.\nThus, we have formulated a GVC for \u03b1 near 0 and \u03b1 near 1, using representations near the trivial one and\na discrete faithful, respectively. How can we connect and explain our choices for other angles \u03b1? A natural\nanswer to this question requires analyzing asymptotics of solutions of difference equations with a parameter.\nThis is a different subject that we will not discuss here; instead we will refer the curious reader to [GG], and\nforthcoming work of the first author.\n\n\fON THE VOLUME CONJECTURE FOR SMALL ANGLES\n\n3\n\n1.2. Upper bounds and confirmation of the volume conjecture for small angles. Our results are\nthe following:\nTheorem 1. For every knot K with c + 2 crossings and every \u03b1 > 0, we have\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog |ev\u03b1,n (JK (n))|\n\u2264 c log 4.\nn\n\nTheorem 2. For every knot K, there exists a positive angle \u03b1(K) > 0 such that the GVC holds for all\n\u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u03b1(K)).\nIn fact, the proof of Theorem 2 reveals that we can take \u03b1(K) to be a function that depends on the\nnumber of crossings of K.\nNotice that the Hyperbolic Volume Conjecture is the case of \u03b1 = 1, which corresponds to a complete\nhyperbolic structure. On the other hand, Theorem 2 deals with small cone-angle fillings, which are expected\nto be spherical structures of zero volume.\nTheorem 1 follows easily from a stronger result. Observe that when |q| = 1, then\n|JK (n)(q)| \u2264 ||JK (n)||1\nP\nwhere the l1 -norm of a Laurrent polynomial f = k ck q k is given by:\nX\nX\n||\nck q k ||1 =\n|ck |.\nk\n\nk\n\nThen, we have the following:\nTheorem 3. For every knot K of c + 2 crossings and every n we have:\n||JK (n)||1 \u2264 nc 4cn .\n\n(3)\n\n1.3. Relation with hyperbolic geometry, and optimal bounds. When \u03b1 = 1, the upper bound in\nTheorem 1 is not optimal, and does not reveal any relationship between the lim sup and hyperbolic geometry.\nOur next theorem fills this gap.\nTheorem 4. For every knot K with c + 2 crossings we have\n2\u03c0 lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog |evn (JK (n))|\n\u2264 v8 c,\nn\n\nwhere evn = ev1,n , v8 = 8\u039b(\u03c0/4) \u2248 3.66386 is the volume of the regular ideal octahedron.\nUsing an ideal decomposition of a knot complement by placing one octahedron per crossing, it follows\nthat for every knot K with c + 2 crossings, we have\n(4)\n\nV (K) \u2264 v8 c.\n\nOn the other hand, if the volume conjecture holds for \u03b1 = 1, then\n2\u03c0 lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog |evn (JK (n))|\n= V (K) \u2264 v8 c.\nn\n\nOne may ask whether (4) (and therefore, whether the bound in Theorem 4) is optimal. Optimality is at\nfirst sight surprising, since it involves all knots (and not just alternating ones) and their number of crossings\n(which carries little known geometric information). In conversations with I.Agol and D.Thurston, it was\ncommunicated to us that the upper bound in (4) is indeed optimal. Moreover a class of knots that achieves\n(in the limit) the optimal ratio of volume by number of crossings is obtained by taking a large chunk of the\n\n\f4\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS AND THANG TQ L\u00ca\n\nfollowing weave, and closing it up to a knot:\n\nThe complement of the weave has a complete hyperbolic structure associated with the square tessellation of\nthe Euclidean plane:\n\nOptimality follows along similar lines as the Appendix of [La], using a stronger estimate for the lower bound\nof the volume of Haken manifolds, cut along an incompressible surface. The stronger statement is the\nfollowing result which will appear in subsequent work of Agol-Storm-W.Thurston, [AST]. Its proof uses,\namong other things, work of Perelman.\nTheorem 5. ([AST]) If M is a hyperbolic finite volume 3-manifold containing a properly imbedded orientable,\nboundary incompressible, incompressible surface S, then\nV (M ) >= V (Guts(M \u2212 int(nbd(S))),\n\nwhere V stands for volume, and the Guts terminology are defined in [Ag].\nThe reader may compare (4) with the following result of Agol-Lackenby-D.Thurston [La]:\nTheorem 6. If K is an alternating knot with a planar projection with t twists, then\nv3 (t \u2212 1)/2 < V (K) < 10v3 (t \u2212 1),\n\nwhere v3 = 2\u039b(\u03c0/3) \u2248 1.01494 is the volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron. Moreover, the class of knots\nobtained by Dehn filling on the chain link has asymptotic ratio of volume by twist number equal to 10v3 . The\ncorresponding tessellation of the Euclidean plane is given by the star of David.\n1.4. The main ideas. Our results have quick proofs, and require only a small dose of elementary analysis,\nand an appropriate view of these powerful quantum invariants of knots.\nWe already saw how Theorem 1 follows from the stronger Theorem 3.\nTo prove Theorem 3, we will make use of a state-sum definition of the colored Jones polynomials, where\nthe local weights are given by R-matrices. In [GL], we used the basic fact that the local weights are qhypergeometric, in order to deduce that the sequence of colored Jones polynomials satisfies a linear recursion\nrelation (the recursion depends on the knot, of course). In our case, we will focus on the fact that the local\nweights take values in Z[q \u00b1 ] in order to give elementary estimates for their l1 -norm.\n\n\fON THE VOLUME CONJECTURE FOR SMALL ANGLES\n\n5\n\nTheorem 2 is trickier. Among other things, the proof uses a key integrality property (due to Habiro)\nof the cyclotomic transform of the colored Jones function. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first\napplication of the cyclotomic transform. In more detail, we will separate out the dependence of the color\nin the colored Jones polynomial JK (n), via the cyclotomic transform. This replaces JK (n) by a sequence\nCK (n) (for n \u2208 N) of rational functions. Habiro proved that CK (n) are actually polynomials. Using the\nl1 -estimates on JK (n), one can deduce only a weak estimate for the Mahler measure of CK (n). Due to the\nspecific structure of the inverse cyclotomic transform, one can prove a useful l1 -estimate for CK (n). Using\nthat estimate, and some elementary analysis, it is easy to finish the proof of Theorem 2.\nIn Section 5, we exploit the fact that the colored Jones function and the cyclotomic function is a solution\nto a linear q-difference equation. Using elementary methods, we give quadratic degree bounds for solutions\nof q-difference equations, and exponential bounds for the l1 norms of solutions of integral (in the sense\nof Laurrent polynomials) q-difference equations. Based on experimental evidence, we conjecture that the\ncyclotomic function is a solution of an integral q-difference equation.\nThe upper bounds for the limsup in Theorem 1 are not sharp for \u03b1 = 1, since they are obtained by\nl1 estimates of the local weights. Using the fact that the local weights are given by a ratio of 5 quantum\nfactorials, and the fact that the asymptotics of quantum factorials are governed by the Lobachevsky function,\nin Section 4 we give better bounds, stated in Theorem 4, which are linear in the number of crossings, and\ninvolve the volume of the regular ideal octahedron. In addition, we conjecture that our improved bounds\nare optimal.\nFinally, in two appendices we discuss the Volume Conjecture for the Borromean rings, and the Generalized\nVolume Conjecture for torus knots.\n2. Proof of Theorem 3\nAs we mentioned above, we will make use of an R-matrix state sum definition of the colored Jones\npolynomial JK (n), discussed, for example, in [GL, Sec.3]. Consider a long knot K \u2032 whose closure is K, and\nfix a positive integer n. To compute JK (n), we follow the following algorithm:\n\u2022 Assign angle variables k at each crossing, and let k = (k1 , k2 , . . . ).\n\u2022 Color each part-arc of the knot projection such that around each crossing the color of the part-arcs\nis given by:\nb+k\n\na\u2212k\n\nb\u2212k\n\nk\na\n\n(5)\n\na+k\nk\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nThere is a unique coloring of the part-arcs such that the two broken part-arcs have color 0.\n\u2022 Assign local weights f (n; a, b, k) \u2208 Z[v \u00b11/2 ] at each crossing, and for a fixed coloring k, let F (n, k)\ndenote the product over all crossings of the corresponding local weights, times v raised to a linear\nform on n, k.\n\u2022 Form the sum\nX\nJK (n) =\nF (n, k).\nk\n\nStrictly speaking, in [GL] we discussed the above algorithm for knots which are closures of braids, but a\nsimilar algorithm works for planar projections of knots as well. This follows from the following figure:\n\nwhich moves crossings (positive or negative) into standard upright position, by an isotopy that creates local\nminima/maxima and no further crossings. The local minima/maxima give rise to an additional multiplicative\nfactor (a monomial in v raised to a linear form in n, k) in F (n, k), and does not affect the estimates below.\n\n\f6\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS AND THANG TQ L\u00ca\n\nIn [GL] we used the fact that the local weights R\u00b1 : Z5 \u2192 Z[v \u00b11/2 ], are q-holonomic functions, in order\nto deduce from first principles that JK is q-holonomic, and thus satisfies a linear recursion relation.\nIn our case, we will make use of the specific integral form of the local weights in order to deduce our\nresult. Let us recall the specific form of the local weights, from [GL, Sec.3].\n\u0014\n\u0015\nb+k\n{n \u2212 1 + k \u2212 a}k ,\nR+ (n; a, b, k) := (\u22121)k v \u2212((n\u22121\u22122a)(n\u22121\u22122b)+k(k\u22121))/2\nk\n\u0014\n\u0015\na+k\n{n \u2212 1 + k \u2212 b}k ,\nR\u2212 (n; a, b, k) := v ((n\u22121\u22122a\u22122k)(n\u22121\u22122b+2k)+k(k\u22121))/2\nk\nwhere v = q 1/2 , and for a, b \u2208 N, we define the q-integers, q-factorial and q-binomial coefficients by:\n\u0014\n\u0015\na\nY\n{a}!\n{a}!\na\n{a},\n{a}b :=\n(6)\n{a} := v a \u2212 v \u2212a ,\n{a}! :=\n,\n:=\nb\n{a \u2212 b}!\n{b}!{a \u2212 b}!\ni=1\n\nFor a fixed coloring k, the colors at the part-arcs of K \u2032 are linear forms on k and n, and the contribution\nis nonzero only when all these linear forms are nonnegative and less than n. In particular, each of the angle\nvariables k has to be 0 \u2264 k < n. Observe that the l1 norm satisfies the inequalities\n(7)\nMoreover,\n\n||f + g||1 \u2264 ||f ||1 + ||g||1 ,\n\u0014\n\nm\nk\n\n\u0015\n\n||f g||1 \u2264 ||f ||1 ||g||1 ,\n\n\u2208 N[v 1/2 ] and\n\u0014\n\nif m \u2264 n.

Combining with the above formulas for R\u00b1 , it follows that ||R\u00b1 (n; a, b, k)||1 \u2264 4n . Since\nR\u00b1 (n; 0, 0, k) = \u03b4k,0 ,\nand since we can always choose a breaking of a knot so that the broken arc ends under the first crossing\nand out of the last crossing, it follows that we can ignore at least two angle variables corresponding to the\nbroken part-arcs. Thus, ||F (n, k)||1 \u2264 4cn , where c + 2 is the number of crossings of K. Since k has to be\n0 \u2264 k < n, (5) implies that we have at most nc choices for the angle variables. The result follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.1. There are several other formulations of the n-th colored Jones polynomial, for example coming\nfrom the Kauffman bracket skein module. Unfortunately, using the Kauffman bracket skein module formulation, it is hard to prove Theorem 3, since the number of crossings of an n-parallel of a knot with c + 2\ncrossings is (c + 2)n2 , a quadratic function of n. Nevertheless, the Kauffman bracket skein module can\ngive good estimates of the min and max degree (and their difference, the span) of the n-th colored Jones\npolynomial. Compare with [Le, Prop.1.2] of the second author, who observes that\nspan(JK (n)) \u2264 cn2 + O(n).\n3. Proof of Theorem 2\n3.1. A reduction of Theorem 2.

Notice that R(n, k) = C(n, k) = 0 for k > n, so the above sums are finite.\nDefinition 3.2. If JK : N \u2212\u2192 Z[q \u00b1 ] denotes the colored Jones function of a knot K, we define the cyclotomic\nfunction of K by CK = CJK .\nA key result of Habiro is that the cyclotomic function of a knot takes values in Z[q \u00b1 ]; see [H1].\nProof. (of Theorem 2) Let us apply the cyclotomic transform to JK (n), in order to isolate the dependence\nof the color.

For every knot K we have:\n(13)\n\n||CK (n)||1 \u2264 eCn+O(log n)\n\nHere, and below, the O(f (n)) notation means that the error is bounded by a constant times f (n).\nThe reader may wonder what we gained starting from JK , going to CK , and then back to JK . The point of\nEquation (11) is that it separates the dependence of JK (n) on the color n, and Theorem 7 gives exponential\nbounds for the l1 norm of the polynomials CK (n).\nFor q = e2\u03c0i\u03b1/n and \u03b1 small and positive, and 0 < k < n, C(n, k) becomes small. Using Lemma 3.3 below\nand Theorem 3, it follows that when 0 < k < n, then\n|ev\u03b1,n (CK (k)C(n, k))|\n\n\u2264\n\n=\n\neCk+O(log k) |3 sin(\u03c0\u03b1)|2k\neC\n\n\u2032\n\n(\u03b1)k+O(log k)\n\n,\n\n\f8\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS AND THANG TQ L\u00ca\n\nwhere C \u2032 (\u03b1) := C + 2 log(3| sin(\u03c0\u03b1)|). Now, choose \u03b1 small enough so that C \u2032 (\u03b1) < 0, and then choose\nk0 = k0 (\u03b1) so that C \u2032 (\u03b1)k + O(log k) < C \u2032 (\u03b1)/2 k for k \u2265 k0 .

Bounds on l1 -norm and Mahler measure of q-holonomic functions. The main result of [GL] is\nthat for every knot K, the functions JK and CK are q-holonomic. Recall that a sequence f : N \u2212\u2192 Q(q) is\nq-holonomic if satisfies a q-linear difference equation. In other words, there exists a natural number d and\nrational functions aj (u, v) \u2208 Q(u, v) for j = 0, . . . , d with ad 6= 0 such that for all n \u2208 N we have:\nd\nX\n\naj (q n , q)f (n + j) = 0.\n\nj=0\n\nIn this section we observe that q-holonomic functions satisfy a priori upper bounds on their degrees and\n(under an integrality assumption) on their l1 -norm. As a simple corollary, we obtain an independent proof\nof Theorems 1 and 3.\nDefinition 5.1. We say that a sequence f : N \u2212\u2192 Z[q \u00b1 ] is q-integral holonomic if it satisfies an integral\nq-difference equation as above with ad = 1 and aj (u, v) \u2208 Z[u, v].\nAlthough JK takes values in Z[q \u00b1 ], it is known for example that J41 is not q-integral holonomic. On the\nother hand, it is known that CK is q-integral holonomic for all twist knots; see [GS].\n\nQuestion 1.

However, the explicit upper bounds in terms of the number of crossings\ncannot be obtained from Theorem 10, unless we know something more about the q-difference equation of\nthe colored Jones function. Moreover, Theorem 2 cannot be obtained from general theory of asymptotics of\nsolutions of q-difference equations, since a typical solution would be growing exponentially, even for small\npositive \u03b1. With additional assumptions on the shape of the q-difference equations, the first author can show\nTheorem 2. The proof was replaced with the one of the present paper.\n5.2.

In the above refernce, the authors\nproved that Jg,K is a q-holonomic function, at least when g is not G2 . For g = sl2 , Jsl2 ,K is the colored\nJones function JK discussed earlier.\nIn [GL] , the authors gave state-sum formulas for Jg,K similar to (5) where the summand takes values in\nZ[q \u00b11/D ], where D is the size of the center of g.\nThe methods of the present paper give an upper bound for the growth-rate of the g-colored Jones function.\nMore precisely, we have:\nTheorem 11. For every simple Lie algebra g (other than G2 ) there exists a constant Cg such that for every\nknot with c + 2 crossings, and every \u03b1 > 0 and every \u03bb \u2208 \u039bw , we have:\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog |ev\u03b1,n (Jg,K (n\u03bb))|\n\u2264 Cg c.\nn\n\nThe details of the above theorem will be explained in a subsequent publication.\n5.3.

The volume conjecture for the Borromean rings\nIt is well-known that the complement of the Borromean rings B can be geometrically identified by gluing\ntwo regular ideal octahedra; [Th]. As a result, the volume V (B) of B is given by 2v8 .\nIf L is a link with a distinguished component (to be broken), then one may define the colored Jones\nfunction JL (n) to be the invariant of the (1, 1)-tangle obtained by breaking the distinguished component\nof L and coloring all components of the tangle by the n-dimensional irreducible representation of sl2 . In\ngeneral, JL (n) depends on the link and its distinguished component. In the case of the Borromean rings B\nthough, due to symmetry, we may choose any component as the distinguished one. Habiro uses the notation\nJ \u0303L (n) for JL (n).\nThe next theorem confirms the volume conjecture for the Borromean rings.\nTheorem 12.

It is easy to check that the restriction of the volume form on any such factor is\nequal to 0.\n\u0003\nThus the volume function V (l, m) on the deformation variety must be constant. Because the Gromov\nnorm of the knot complement is 0, one should define V (l, m) = 0 for every l, m. Then the generalized volume\nconjecture can be proved easily in this case:\nProposition B.2. For the torus knot K = T (a, b) and for any real number \u03b1, one has\n(24)\n\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog |ev\u03b1,n (JK (n))|\n= 0.\nn\n\nProof. There are 2 cases: \u03b1 is an integer, or \u03b1 is not. The first case is actually much more difficult, this is\nthe usual volume conjecture and it has been proved by Kashaev and Tirkkonen in [KT]. Let us consider the\neasier case, when \u03b1 is not an integer.\nNote that v = exp(\u03c0i\u03b1/n), and if \u03b1 is not an integer one has v n \u2212 v \u2212n = 2i sin \u03c0\u03b1/n 6= 0.\nThe colored Jones polynomial was calculated by Morton in [Mo]:\n2\n\n(25)\n\nJT (a,b)(n)\n\nv \u2212ab(n \u22121)/2\n=\nv n \u2212 v \u2212n\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nk=1\u2212n,k+n\u22611\n\n(v 2abk\n\n2\n\n+2ka+2kb+1\n\n(mod 2)\n\n\u2212 v 2abk\n\n2\n\n+2ka\u22122kb\u22121\n\n).\n\nThe sum contains n + 1 terms, each by absolute value is less than or equal to 2. Hence\n|ev\u03b1,n (JK (n))| <\n\n2(n + 1)\n.\nsin(\u03c0\u03b1/n)\n\nThus, the limsup is less than or equal to 0. The argument in Section 3 shows that the lim inf is greater than\nor equal to 0. The result follows.\n\u0003\nRemark B.3. In [M2], H. Murakami discusses the Generalized Voume Conjecture for the torus knots and\nangles \u03b1 with nonzero imaginary part.\n\n\fON THE VOLUME CONJECTURE FOR SMALL ANGLES\n\n17\n\nReferences\n[Ag]\nI.
