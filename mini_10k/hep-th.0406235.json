However, it contains some theoretical key problems\nsuch as the flatness and the horizon problems[1, 2]. So\nfar, only the idea of inflation provides a resolution of\nthose problems. Not only it gives some picture of the\nearlier stage of the universe before a big bang but also\nit seems to be supported by some of recent observational\ndata on CMB. While, it is still unclear what is the origin of inflaton. So far, there is no convincing link with\nfundamental unified theories such as a string/M theory.\nRecently a new paradigm on the early universe has\nbeen proposed, which is so-called a brane world[3, 4].\nSuch speculation has been inspired by recent developments in string/M-theory[5, 6, 7]. There has been\ntremendous works in this scheme of dimensional reduction where ordinary matter fields are confined to a lowerdimensional hypersurface, while only gravitational fields\npropagate throughout all of spacetime. In particular,\nit was shown that the 10-dimensional E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic string theory, which is a strong candidate to describe our real world, is equivalent to an 11-dimensional\nM theory compactified to M10 \u00d7 S1 /Z2 [5]. Then\nthe 10-dimensional spacetime is expected to be compactified into M4 \u00d7 CY 6 , where M4 and CY6 are\n4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and 6-dimensional\nCalabi-Yau space, respectively. Randall and Sundrum [8]\nalso proposed a new model where four-dimensional Newtonian gravity is recovered at low energies even without\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: takamizu@gravity.phys.waseda.ac.jp\naddress: maeda@gravity.phys.waseda.ac.jp\n\ncompact extra dimensions. Based on such a new world\npicture, many cosmological scenario have been studied\n[9, 10, 11]. See also recent reviews[12, 13, 14, 15]. We\nhave found some deviations from standard cosmology\nby modifications of 4-dimensional Einstein equations on\nthe brane[16], even for the case there is a scalar field in\nbulk[17].\nIn such a brane world scenario, for resolving the abovementioned theoretical key problems in the big bang theory, new idea of the early universe has been proposed,\nwhich is called the ekpyrotic scenario or a cyclic universe scenario [18, 19]. It is based on a collision of two\ncold branes. The universe starts with a cold, empty and\nnearly BPS ground state of M theory, which contains\ntwo parallel branes at rest. Two branes approach each\nother and then collide. The energy is dissipated on the\nbrane and the big bang universe will start. The BPS\nstate is required in order to remain a supersymmetry in\na low-energy 4-dimensional effective action. The visible and hidden branes are flat, which are described by\na Minkowski spacetime, but the bulk is warped along\nthe fifth dimension. Since this scenario is not only motivated by the fundamental unified theory but also it may\nresolve the theoretical key problems such as the flatness\nand horizon problems, it would be very attractive. There\nare also many discussions about density perturbations to\nsee whether this scenario is really a reliable model for the\nearly universe[20, 21, 22, 23].\nOn the other hand, even though there are some works\nby[24], the reheating process itself in this scenario has\nnot been so far investigated in detail. Hence, in this\npaper, we study how we can recover the hot big bang\nuniverse after the collision of the branes. Here we investigate quantum creation of particles, which are confined\nto the brane, at the collision of two branes. It may be\ndifficult to deal properly with the collision of two branes\nin a basic string theory. Hence, in this paper, we adopt a\n\n\f2\ndomain wall which is constructed by some scalar field as\na brane, and analyze the collision of two domain walls in\na 5-dimensional bulk spacetime. Some works also adopt\nsuch a picture [25, 26]. It is worth noting that there is a\nthick domain wall model for a brane world[27].\nIn order to analyze particle creation at the brane collision, in this paper we consider the simplest situation. We\ndiscuss that two domain walls collide in a 5D Minkowski\nspacetime. In Sec. II, we analyze the collision of two\ndomain walls. Then, in Sec. III, we investigate particle\ncreation on the wall at the collision. Applying the particle production to the energy dissipation of the brane,\nwe discuss the reheating mechanism of a brane universe.\nWe use the unit of c = ~ = 1.\n\nII.\n\nCOLLISION OF TWO DOMAIN WALLS\nA.\n\nBasic equations and initial setting\n\nWe study the collision of two flat domain walls in 5dimensional (5D) Minkowski spacetime. To construct a\ndomain wall structure, we adopt a real scalar field \u03a6 with\na double-well potential,\nV (\u03a6) =\n\n\u03bb 2\n(\u03a6 \u2212 \u03b7 2 )2 ,\n4\n\n\u03a6\n, \u03bb\u0303 = m\u03b7 \u03bb .\n\u03b7\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn what follows, we omit the tilde in dimensionless variables for brevity.\nThe equation of motion for \u03a6 in 5D is given by\n\u03a6\u0308 \u2212 \u03a6\u2032\u2032 + \u03bb \u03a6 (\u03a62 \u2212 1) = 0 ,\n\n\u03a6(y, 0) = \u03a6\u03c5 (y + y0 , 0) \u2212 \u03a6\u2212\u03c5 (y \u2212 y0 , 0) \u2212 1 , (2.6)\nwhere y = \u00b1y0 is the initial position of the walls. The\nspatial separation of two walls is given by 2y0 , and as long\nas the separation distance is much larger than the thickness of a wall (y0 \u226b d), the initial profile (2.6) gives a\ngood approximate solution for two moving domain walls.\nThe initial value of \u03a6\u0307 is also given by\n\u03a6\u0307(y, 0) = \u03a6\u0307\u03c5 (y + y0 , 0) \u2212 \u03a6\u0307\u2212\u03c5 (y \u2212 y0 , 0) .\n\n(2.7)\n\nUsing this initial values, we solve the dynamical equation\n(2.3) numerically, whose results will be shown in the next\nsubsection.\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the potential minima are located at \u03a6 = \u00b1\u03b7.\nWe discuss the collision of two parallel domain walls.\nThe scalar field is assumed to depend only on a time\ncoordinate t and one spatial coordinate y. The rest three\nspatial coordinates are denoted by x. We rescale the\nparameters and variables by \u03b7 (or its mass scale m\u03b7 =\n\u03b7 2/3 ) as\nt\u0303 = m\u03b7 t , \u1ef9 = m\u03b7 y , \u03a6\u0303 =\n\nconstant speed \u03c5 in the y direction is given by boosting the solution (2.4). We find a moving domain wall\nsolution, whose initial position is located at y = 0, as\ni\nh \u03b3\n(y \u2212 \u03c5t) ,\n(2.5)\n\u03a6\u03c5 (y, t) = tanh\nd\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b3 = 1/ 1 \u2212 \u03c5 2 is the Lorentz factor.\nIn order to discuss the collision of two domain walls, we\nfirst have to set up the initial data. We put a kink and an\nantikink solution, which are separated at large distance,\nand are moving toward each other with velocities \u03c5 and\n\u2212\u03c5. The explicit initial configuration is given by\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere  \u0307 and \u2032 denote \u2202/\u2202t and \u2202/\u2202y, respectively.\nEq. (2.3) has not only two stable vacuum solutions\n\u03a6\u00b1 = \u00b11 but also a static kink solution (K), which is\ntopologically stable. The latter one is called a domain\nwall, which is described by\nh y i\n,\n(2.4)\n\u03a6K (y) = tanh\nd\np\nwhere d = 2/\u03bb is the thickness of the wall [28]. The\nantikink solution (K\u0304) is obtained from Eq. (2.4) by reflecting the spatial coordinate y as \u03a6K\u0304 (y) = \u03a6K (\u2212y) =\n\u2212\u03a6K (y). A single domain wall solution moving with a\n\nB.\n\nTime Evolution of Domain Walls\n\nWe use a numerical approach to solve the equations\nfor the colliding domain walls. The numerical method is\nshown in Appendix A. We have two free parameters in\nour simulation of\np the two-wall collision, i.e. a thickness\nof the wall d = 2/\u03bb and an initial velocity of the walls\n\u03c5. The collision of two walls was discussed by [29] in 4dimensional Minkowski space. Although we discuss the\ndomain wall collision in 5-dimensional Minkowski space,\nour basic equations are exactly the same as their case,\nand then we find the same results as theirs. In particular,\nthe results are very sensitive to the initial velocity \u03c5.\nFirst we show the numerical results for two typical\ninitial velocities, i.e. \u03c5 = 0.2 and 0.4 in Figs. 1, 2. The\nevolution of the energy density of \u03a6 is shown in Figs. 1\nand 2. The energy density of the scalar field is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03bb 2\n2\n\u20322\n2\n\u03c1\u03a6 =\n(2.8)\n\u03a6\u0307 + \u03a6 + (\u03a6 \u2212 1) .\n2\n2\nFrom Figs. 1 and 2, we find some peaks of the energy\ndensity, by which we can define the positions of moving\nwalls (y = \u00b1yW (t)).\nFrom Figs. 1 and 2, we see the detail of the collision\nas follows. For the case of initial velocity \u03c5 = 0.4,\nwe find that, the collision occurs once, while it does\ntwice for the case of \u03c5 = 0.2. To be precise, in the\nlatter case, after two walls collide first, they bounce, recede to a finite distance, and then return to collide again.\n\n\f3\nlocities as shown in Appendix B (see also [29]). We find\nthat the number of bounce is not monotonic function of \u03c5,\nbut is much more complicated. If we change the incident\nvelocity slightly, the number of bounce changes. The existence of a fractal structure in the parameter space is\nshown in Fig. 6 of [29].\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nFIG. 1: Collision of two domain walls for the case of the initial\nvelocity \u03c5 = 0.4. The time evolution of the energy density of\nscalar field \u03a6 is shown from t = 0 to 150. The maximum\npoint of \u03c1\u03a6 defines the position of a wall (y = yW (t)).\n\nPARTICLE PRODUCTION ON A MOVING\nDOMAIN WALL\nQuantization of a particle on the domain wall\nand its production rate\n\nOnce we find the solution of colliding domain walls, we\ncan evaluate the time evolution of a scalar field on the\ndomain wall. Since we assume that we are living on one\ndomain wall, we are interested in production of a particle confined to the domain wall. We assume that there\nis some coupling between a 5D scalar field \u03a6 which is\nresponsible for the domain wall and a particle on the domain wall. Because the value of the scalar field changes\nwith time, we expect quantum particle production occurs. This may be important for a reheating mechanism\nof the colliding domain walls.\nHence we have to know the value of the scalar filed \u03a6\non the domain wall, i.e. \u03a6W (\u03c4 ) = \u03a6(t, yW (t)). Since the\nwall is moving in a 5D Minkowski space, we have to use\nthe proper time \u03c4 of the wall, which is given by\nZ t q\n\u03c4=\ndt 1 \u2212 \u1e8fW2 (t) ,\n(3.1)\n0\n\nwhen we estimate the particle production in our 4dimensional domain wall.\nWe consider a particle on the domain wall which is described by a scalar field \u03c8. We assume that it is confined\nto the domain wall and couples to the scalar field \u03a6 as\nFIG. 2: Collision of two domain walls for the case of the initial\nvelocity \u03c5 = 0.2. The time evolution of the energy density of\nthe scalar field \u03a6 is shown from t = 0 to 150. We find that\ncollision occurs twice at t \u2248 58 and 77. We set \u03bb = 1.0. From\nthis figure, we find clearly that collision occurs twice.\n\nAs shown by several authors [29, 30, 31, 32], however,\nthe result highly depends on the incident velocity \u03c5 . In\nAppendix B, we show our detail analysis, which confirms\nthe previous works. For a sufficiently large velocity, it\nis expected that a kink and antikink will just bounce off\nonce because there is no time to exchange the energy\nduring the collisional process. In fact, it was shown in\n[29] that two walls just bounce off once for \u03c5 >\n\u223c0.25. For\nsmaller velocity, we find multiple bounces when they collide. The number of bounce during the collision depends\ncomplicatedly on the incident velocity. For example, the\nbounce occurs once for \u03c5 = 0.4, while twice for \u03c5 = 0.2.\nWe also find many bounce solutions for other incident ve-\n\ng 2 \u03c62 (\u03c4 )\u03c8 2 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere g is a coupling constant. Here \u03c6(\u03c4 ) is the 4dimensional scalar field, which is induced from the 5dimensional \u03a6 as\n\u221a\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) \u2248 2d \u03a6W (\u03c4 ) .\n(3.3)\nWe have also assumed that the effective width of the domain wall when it collides is about 2d, which is confirmed\nby numerical simulation. In Fig. 3, we depict the spatial\ndistribution of the scalar field \u03a6 when the domain walls\ncollide. Note that \u03a6w (\u03c4 ) is the maximum amplitude in\nthis distribution.\nThe basic equation for \u03c8 is then\n\nwhere\n\n\u22022\u03c8\n\u2212 \u22072 \u03c8 + \u1e21 2 \u03a62W (\u03c4 ) \u03c8 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u221a\n2 2 2\n\u1e21 = 2dg = 1/2 g .\n\u03bb\n\n(3.5)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\f4\nas\nak |0 >in = 0\n\n, \u2200k .\n\n(3.12)\n\nAfter the collision of domain walls, we expect that the\nvalue of \u03a6W again approaches zero (see the detail in the\nnext subsection). We can also define the vacuum state\n|0 >out , which is different from the initial vacuum state\n|0 >in . The eigen function of \u03c8k for \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e is then given\n(in)\n(in)\u2217\nby a linear combination of \u03c8k and \u03c8k\nas\n(out)\n\n\u03c8k\n\n(in)\n\n= \u03b1k \u03c8k\n\n(in)\u2217\n\n+ \u03b2k \u03c8k\n\n,\n\n(3.13)\n\nand the annihilation and creation operators as\n\u0101k = \u03b1k ak + \u03b2k\u2217 a\u2020k ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere \u03b1k , \u03b2k are the Bogolubov coefficients, which satisfy the normalization condition\n|\u03b1k |2 \u2212 |\u03b2k |2 = 1 .\n\nFIG. 3: The spatial distribution of the scalar field \u03a6 when\nthe domain walls collide. d is the thickness of the wall. The\nscalar field has non-vanishing value for the effective width of\n2d at the collision.\n\nSince our background spacetime is the 4-dimensional\nMinkowski space, it is easy to quantize the scalar field\n\u03c8. In a canonical quantization scheme [33], we expand \u03c8\nas\nX\n\u03c8(\u03c4, x) =\n[ak \u03c8k (\u03c4 ) uk (x) + a\u2020k \u03c8k\u2217 (\u03c4 )u\u2217k (x)] , (3.6)\nk\n\nwhere uk (x) = (2\u03c0)\u2212 2 eik*x .

Since two domain walls are initially far\naway each other, the value of \u03a6W is almost zero. We can\nquantize \u03c8 as a usual quantization scheme. The eigen\nfunction with a positive frequency is given by\n(in)\n\u03c8k\n\n1\ne\u2212i\u03c9k \u03c4 ,\n= \u221a\n2\u03c9k\n\n(3.8)\n\np\nwhere \u03c9k = k 2 + \u1e21 2 \u03a62W (0) \u2248 k. We impose the equal\ntime commutation relation for the operators ak and a\u2020k\n[ak , ak\u2032 ] = 0 ,\n[a\u2020k , a\u2020k\u2032 ]\n[ak , a\u2020k\u2032 ]\n\n(3.9)\n\n=0,\n\n(3.10)\n\n= \u03b4kk\u2032 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere ak and a\u2020k are an annihilation and a creation operators.

The creation\nof the particles with mode k is evaluated as\n< 0|in : Hk : |0 >in = |\u03b2k |2 \u03c9k as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e .\n\n(3.17)\n\nAs a result, the number density and energy density of\nproduced particles are given by\nZ\nn =\n|\u03b2k |2 d3 k ,\n(3.18)\nZ\n\u03c1 =\n|\u03b2k |2 \u03c9k d3 k .\n(3.19)\nB.\n\nTime evolution of a scalar field on the domain\nwall and particle production\n\nNow we estimate the particle production by the domain wall collision. In Figs. 4 and 5, we depict the time\nevolution of \u03a6W on one moving wall with respect to \u03c4 .\nIn Fig. 1, we find one collision point, which corresponds\nto a spike in Fig. 4, and two-bounce in Fig. 2 gives two\nspikes in Fig. 5.\nWe also show the results for different values of the coupling constant \u03bb in Figs. 6 and 7 (\u03bb = 10). If Fig. 6 we\nfind that when \u03bb gets larger as \u03bb = 10, the spike of \u03a6W\nbecomes sharp. The same thing happens in the case of\ntwo bounce (see Fig. 7).\nIn Figs. 4-7, we find that \u03a6W begins to oscillate after\nthe collision. We also find that the period of these oscillations in Figs. 6 and 7 is shorter that those in Figs.\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 4: Time evolution of a scalar field on one moving wall\nfor \u03c5 = 0.4, \u03bb = 1.0. The value of the scalar field is given by\n\u03a6W (\u03c4 ) = \u03a6(t, yW (t)), where yW (t) is the position of the wall\nand \u03c4 is the proper time on the wall.\n\n2\nvelocity limit (\u03c5 >\n\u223c0.6), we find \u03a6\u221e \u2248 0.18(\u03b3 \u2212 1), where\n\u03a6\u221e is the amplitude of the post-oscillation.\nSince the scalar field on the domain wall oscillates as\n\u03a6W \u2248 \u03a6\u221e cos \u03c3\u03c4 after the collision, our wave equation\n(3.7) would be rewritten as\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 2 2\n2\n \u0308\n(3.20)\n\u03c8k + k + \u1e21 \u03a6\u221e (1 + cos 2\u03c3\u03c4 ) \u03c8k = 0 ,\n2\np\nwhere \u03c3 = 3/2\u03bb1/2 is the eigenvalue of the perturbation eigen function, it is so-called Methieu equation.\nFrom this equation, we may wonder whether we can\nignore this oscillation when we evaluate particle production rate. In fact, when we discuss a preheating\nmechanism via a parametric resonance with a similar\noscillating behavior[34], in conventional cosmology[1] as\nwell as brane world cosmology [35]. It is known that\nfor Methieu equation, there is an exponential instability\n\u03c8k \u221d exp(\u03bck t) within a set of resonance bands, where\n\u03bck = \u1e21\u03a62\u221e /8. This instability corresponds to an exponential growth of created particles, which is essential in\nthe preheating mechanism. In order to get a successful\nparticle production by this resonance instability, however, we have to require large value of \u1e21 2 \u03a62\u221e . However, in\nthe present simulation, it is rather small, e.g. \u03a6\u221e \u223c 0.1\nfor the case of \u03c5 = 0.4. Hence, we may ignore such a particle production by a parametric resonance in the present\ncalculation. However, if the incident velocity is very fast\nsuch as a speed of light, we may find a large oscillation.\nThen we could have an instant preheating process by the\ndomain wall collision. We also wonder whether or not\nthe standard reheating mechanism due to the decay of\noscillating scalar field is effective. In this case, we have\nto evaluate the decay rate \u0393\u03c6 to other particles. Since\n\nFIG. 5: Time evolution of a scalar field \u03a6W (\u03c4 ) on one moving\nwall for \u03c5 = 0.2, \u03bb = 1.0.\n\n4 and 5. One may wonder whether this oscillation is realistic or not. This oscillation, however, turns out not\nto be a numerical error but a real oscillation of the domain wall. In Appendix C, using perturbation analysis\nwe show there is one stable oscillation around the kink\nsolution \u03a6K (y). We expect that the oscillation is excited\nby the collision. In fact, the amplitude of the oscillation\nincreases as the incident velocity \u03c5 increases.

We study two cases with \u1e21 = 0.01 and 0.1. The\nenergy density for \u1e21 = 0.1 is 104 times larger than that\nfor \u1e21 = 0.1, which means that \u03c1 is proportional to \u1e21 4 .\n(2) The energy density \u03c1 for \u03c5 = 0.2 is twice larger than\nthat for \u03c5 = 0.4. It may be so because the bounce occurs\ntwice for \u03c5 = 0.2, while once for \u03c5 = 0.4.\n(3) The energy density is less sensitive to \u03bb.\nWe also investigate for several different initial velocities because the collisional process is very sensitive to\nits incident velocity. We analyze many cases with two\nbounces, with three bounces, with four bounces, * * * in\nthe range \u03c5 = 0.2-0.25 as shown in Appendix B. Using\nthose numerical data, we also evaluate the number and\nenergy densities of the particles created at the collision.\nThe results are summarized in Table II.\nFrom this Table, we confirm the above three features\n(1)-(3). In particular, it becomes more clear that the\nenergy density is proportional to the number of bounce\nNb .\nWe can summarize our results by the following empirical formula\nn \u2248 25d\u1e21 4 Nb ,\n\u03c1 \u2248 20\u1e21 4Nb .\n\n\u03c5\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.1\n0.2\n\n1.0 1.414\n10 0.447\n1.0 1.414\n\n2\n1\n\n7.19\u00d710\u22127 3.90\u00d710\u22127\n\n1.16\u00d710\u22123 2.05\u00d710\u22123\n\n1.0 1.414\n\n6.65\u00d710\u22123 3.81\u00d710\u22123\n\n10 0.447\n\n2\n\nIf this energy of the particles is thermalized by interaction and thermal equilibrium state is realized, we can\nestimate the reheating temperature by\n\n2.26\u00d710\u22127 3.91\u00d710\u22127\n3.57\u00d710\u22123 2.01\u00d710\u22123\n\n10 0.447\n\n2.24\u00d710\u22123 3.88\u00d710\u22123\n\nTABLE I: The number and energy densities (n and \u03c1) of\ncreated particles for the typical values of the coupling\np \u1e21, the\nincident velocity \u03c5 and the self-coupling \u03bb. d = 2/\u03bb and\nNb denote the width of the wall and the number of bounces\nat the collision, respectively.\n\n\u0393\u03c6 \u221d \u1e21 4 , we expect that the reheating temperature is\nproportional to \u1e21 2 , which is enough small to be ignored.\nNote that there is another factor which reduces the decay\nrate in the case that the potential is not a spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking type[34].\nIn what follows, we ignore the creation due to postoscillation stage. Hence, we just follow the procedure\nshown in the previous subsection. Using the evolution\nof the scalar field \u03a6W , we calculate the Bogolubov coefficients \u03b1k and \u03b2k . In Table I, we show the results for\nthree different parameters; \u03c5 (the incident velocity), \u03bb\n(the self-coupling constant of the scalar field), and \u1e21 (the\ncoupling constant to a particle \u03c8).\nFrom this Table, we find the following three features:\n\n(3.21)\n(3.22)\n\n\u03c1=\n\n\u03c02\ngeff TR4 ,\n30\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere geff is the effective number of degrees of freedom\nof particles.

These parameters can\nbe described by physical quantities as k0 \u2248 1/d and\nA \u2248 \u03a60 d2 \u1e21 4 . The reason is well understood. k0 \u2248 1/d\n\n\f7\nmeans that the typical wave number is given by the width\nof the scalar field when domain walls collide (see Fig. 3).\nAs for \u03b2, it corresponds to the \"reflection\" coefficient of\nthe \"potential\" given by Figs. 4-7 and then it will be\nproportional to the coupling constant \u1e21 2 , and the reflection rate (|\u03b2|2 ) will be related to the potential depth \u03a60\nand the square of the width d2 .\nIntegrating the fitting spectrum (3.26), we obtain\nZ \u221e\nn =\nnk dk = (2\u03c0)3/2 \u03a60 d\u1e21 4 \u2248 25d\u1e21 4 , (3.27)\n0\nZ \u221e\n\u03c1 =\nnk \u03c9k dk = 4\u03c0\u03a60 \u1e21 4 \u2248 20\u1e21 4 ,\n(3.28)\n0\n\nwhich values are exactly the same as those obtained by\nnumerical integration in the case with one bounce (see\nEqs. (3.21) and (3.22)). We expect that they are enhanced by the factor Nb when we find Nb bounces at the\ncollision.\nTherefore, although we obtain the particle creation numerically, the result is easily understood and summarized\nby a simple formula.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe study the particle production at the collision of two\ndomain walls in 5D Minkowski spacetime.

We find that the\nparticle creation is affected more greatly by a coupling\nconstant \u1e21 than the other two parameters \u03c5 and \u03bb. The\ninitial velocity changes the collision process, that is the\nnumber of bounce at the collision, but this is less sensitive\nto the temperature. The thickness of a domain wall d (or\na self-coupling constant \u03bb) changes the width of potential \u03a62w (\u03c4 ) of a particle field (\u03c8), and it changes a typical\nenergy scale of created particles, which is estimated as\n\u03c9 \u223c 1/d.\nIn order to find a successful reheating, a reheating temperature must be higher than 102 GeV, because we wish\nto explain the baryon number generation at the electroweak energy scale[2].

(3.24) is written in the\nfollowing form;\n\u22121/4 \u22121\n\nm\u03b7 \u2248 1.1Nb\n\n\u1e21\n\n7\n\nTR\n\n\u2248 1.1 \u00d7 10 [GeV]\nTABLE II: The number and energy densities (n and \u03c1) of\ncreated particles with respect to the number of bounces Nb .\n\u03c5 and d are the incident velocity and the width of the wall,\nrespectively.

The scalar field on the grid points is defined by\n\u03a6n (t) = \u03a6(yn , t), where yn = n\u25b3y, for n = 1, 2, . . . , N .\nWe use the fourth-order center difference scheme to approximate the second spatial derivative [36] as\n\u2202 2 \u03a6n\n1\n=\n[\u2212\u03a6n\u22122 + 16\u03a6n\u22121 \u2212 30\u03a6n\n\u2202y 2\n12(\u25b3y)2\n+ 16\u03a6n+1 \u2212 \u03a6n+2 ] + O((\u25b3y)4 ) .\n\n(A1)\n\nThis leads to a set of N coupled second-order ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE's) for the \u03a6n , i.e.\nd2 \u03a6n\n=\ndt2\nFIG. 9: Spectrum of the created particles at the collision.\nWe plot log |\u03b2k |2 k2 with respect to k for \u03c5 = 0.4, \u03bb = 10, \u1e21 =\n10\u22122 . The gaussian distribution is plotted by a dotted line,\nwhich gives a good approximation for k \u2264 2.5. In the small\nbox, we enlarge the low frequency region (k \u2264 1) to see the\ndeviation from the gaussian distribution.\n\nfor \u1e21 = 10\u22122 , which are slightly larger than TeV scale.\nHere we assume geff = 100\nIn the present work, we consider the 3-dimensional domain walls in the 5-dimensional Minkowski space and\nshow that the particle production at the two-wall collision may provide a successful mechanism for reheating in\nthe ekpyrotic universe. In a string/M theory, however,\nwe expect higher dimensions, e.g. 10 or 11. If we compactify it to the effective 5-dimensional spacetime, our\nwork can be applicable to such a mode. Moreover, if we\ndiscuss a collision of a p-dimensional walls (branes) in\n(p + 2)-dimensional spacetime, our approach can also be\nextended.\nIn this paper, we have not taken account of effects from\na background spacetime. We are planning to study how\nsuch a generalization affects the present results about\nparticle creation at the collision.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank S. Mizuno, T.

For the boundaries, we set the\nleft and right grid boundaries at yL = \u221240 and yR =\n+40, and impose the condition as \u03a6(y = yL , t) = \u03a6(y =\nyR , t) = \u22121 . The grid number is N = 8000 with the grid\nsize of \u25b3y = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 . The initial position of a wall y0\nis set by y0 = |yL + (yR \u2212 yL + 1)/3| = 13, equivalently,\none-third of the numerical range. For time steps, we set\n\u25b3t = 0.7 \u00d7 \u25b3y.\nAs for the particle production process, we have to solve\nthe second-order ordinary differential equations (3.7) for\neach wave number k. By using the fourth-order RungeKutta scheme, we solve them for the wave number k of\n0 < k < 100 with the width \u25b3k = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 . We estimate |\u03b2k |2 in the equation (3.13).

First we show two typical\nexamples in Fig. 10. The figures show the behaviors\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 10: Time evolution of \u03a6 field at y = 0 are depicted for\n(a) \u03c5 = 0.4 \u03bb = 1.0 and (b) \u03c5 = 0.2, \u03bb = 1.0. The bounce\noccurs once for a large velocity (a), while Two bounces are\nfound for the slower velocity.\n\na domain wall structure which is excited by the collision.\nFrom Fig. 10, we find there is one bounce for \u03c5 = 0.4,\nwhile a bounce occurs twice for \u03c5 = 0.2. In fact, the\nresults are very much sensitive to the incident velocities\nas shown in [29].\nHere we present several examples to show how the behaviors of the scalar field depend on \u03c5, which confirm the\nprevious works.\nIn Figs. 11 (a) and (b), we show the case for \u03c5 = 0.2062\nand \u03c5 = 0.2049, respectively. We find three bounces\nat the collision. Four-bounce solutions are depicted in\nFigs. 12 (a) (\u03c5 = 0.229283) and (b) (\u03c5 = 0.2292928).\nThese calculation shows that the detail collisional process\nis very sensitive to the incident velocity.\nAPPENDIX C: PERTURBATIONS OF A\nDOMAIN WALL\n\nWe show that the oscillation we find in Sec III B, is a\nproper oscillation around a static stable domain wall. To\nshow it, we perturb the static domain wall solution (2.4)\nas\n\u03a6 = \u03a6K (y) + \u03b4\u03a6(t, y) .\n\n(C1)\n\nIn this appendix, we use the dimensionless variables\nrescaled by \u03b7. Substituting this into Eq. (2.3) and linearizing it, we obtain\nFIG. 11: Time evolution of \u03a6 field at y = 0 are depicted for\n(a) \u03c5 = 0.2062 \u03bb = 1.0 and (b) \u03c5 = 0.2049, \u03bb = 1.0. Three\nbounces are found.\n\nof the scalar field \u03a6 at y = 0 with respect to t. Initially, when two domain walls locate at large distance,\nthe value of the scalar field at y = 0 is 1. Then two\nwalls approach and collide. At this point the value of\n|\u03a6 \u2212 1| increases. After the collision, it again decreases\nto an initial value. We find some small oscillation around\n\nFIG. 12: Time evolution of \u03a6 field at y = 0 are depicted for\n(a) \u03c5 = 0.229283 \u03bb = 1.0 and (b) \u03c5 = 0.2292928, \u03bb = 1.0.\nFour bounces are found.\n\n\u03b4 \u03a6\u0308 \u2212 \u03b4\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + \u03bb(3\u03a62K \u2212 1)\u03b4\u03a6 = 0 .\n\n(C2)\n\n\u03b4\u03a6 = e\u2212i\u03c3t F (y) ,\n\n(C3)\n\nSetting\n\nand introducing new variable \u0233 = tanh(y/d), we rewrite\nEq. (C2) as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd2 F\ndF\n2 \u2212 \u03c3 2 /\u03bb\n(1 \u2212 \u0233 2 ) 2 \u2212 2\u0233\nF = 0 . (C4)\n+2 3\u2212\nd\u0233\nd\u0233\n1 \u2212 \u0233 2\nThe solution is given by the associated Legendre function.\nImposing the boundary condition (F \u2192 0 as \u0233 \u2192 \u221e), we\nhave two regular solutions;\nF (\u0233) = P22 (\u0233) with \u03c3 = 0\np\n1\n1/2\nand P2 (\u0233) with \u03c3 = 3/2\u03bb .\nFor the former mode, it just corresponds to a boost\nof a kink solution in the y direction, because we find\nF (y) \u2248 \u03a6K (y) \u2212 \u03a6K (y \u2212 dy). The latter one is the oscillation mode which we find in Sec II B. In fact, taking\nthe average over 10 cycles in the oscillation after the collision in Fig. 4, we obtain the mean angular\np frequency\nis about 1.17, which is very close to \u03c3 = 3/2 \u223c 1.22.\nThe ratio is about 0.96. We also evaluate the angular\nfrequency for other cases. We find 1.33 = 1.09\u03c3 for Fig.\n5, 3.67 = 0.95\u03c3 for Fig. 6, and 4.18 = 1.08\u03c3 for Fig. 7.\nFrom the figures, we also find that the amplitude of oscillation gets larger as the incident velocity is faster. This\nis because the excitation energy of a wall at the collision\nwill be large for a large velocity.\n\n\f10\nWe then conclude that the oscillations after the collision of two domain walls is the proper oscillations around\n\n[1] A.
