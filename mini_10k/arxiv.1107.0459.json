When two vessels brought in close contact and\na high electric field is applied between the vessels, the\nwater starts creeping up the beakers and forms a bridge\nwhich is maintained over a certain distance as schematically illustrated in figure 1. Due to the voltage applied\nby the vessels the electric field is longitudinally oriented\ninside the cylindrical bridge. It has remained attractive\nto current experimental activities [2, 3]. On the one side\nthe properties of water are such complex that a complete\nmicroscopic theory of this effect is still lacking. On the\nother side the formation of water bridges on nanoscales\nare of interest both for fundamental understanding of\nelectrohydrodynamics and for applications ranging from\natomic force microscopy [4] to electrowetting problems\n[5]. Microscopically the nanoscale wetting is important\nto confine chemical reactions [6] which reveals an interesting interplay between field-induced polarization, surface\ntension, and condensation [7, 8].\nMolecular dynamical simulations have been performed\nin order to explore the mechanism of water bridges at\nz\nf(x)\nzmax\n\nL\nR\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: The schematic picture of water bridge between two\nbeakers.\n\nthe molecular level leading to the formation of aligned\ndipolar filaments between the boundaries of nanoscale\nconfinements [9]. A competition was found of orientation of molecular dipoles and the electric field leading\nto a threshold where the rise of a pillar overcomes the\nsurface tension [8]. In this respect the understanding of\nthe microscopic structure is essential to explain such phenomena in micro-fluidics [10]. The problem is connected\nwith the dynamics of charged liquids which is important\nfor capillary jets [11], current applications in ink printers\nand electrosprays [12, 13]. Consequently the nonlinear\ndynamics of breakup of free surfaces and flows has been\nstudied intensively [14, 15].\nMuch physical insight can be gained already on the\nmacroscopic scale, where the phenomena of liquid bridging is not restricted to water but can be observed in\nother liquids too [16] which shows that it has its origin\nin electrohydrodynamics [17] rather then in molecularspecific structures. The traditional treatment is based\non the Maxwell pressure tensor where the electric field\neffects comes from the ponderomotoric forces and due\nto boundary conditions of electrodynamics [18]. This\nis based exclusively on the fact that bulk-charge states\ndecay on a time scale of the dielectric constant divided\nby the conductivity, \u01eb\u01eb0 /\u03c3, which takes for pure water\n0.14ms. This decay-time of bulk charges follows from\nthe continuity of charge density \u03c1\u0307c = \u2212\u2207 * j combined\nwith Ohm's law j = \u03c3E = \u2212\u03c3\u2207\u03c6 where the source of the\nelectric field is given by the potential \u22072 \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c1c /\u01eb\u01eb0 .\nAn overview about the different forces occurring in microelectrode structures are discussed in [19].\nThis simple Ohm picture leads to a problem in partially charged liquids. Following the Ohm picture one\nhas a constant velocity or current density of charged particles caused by the external field and limited by friction.\nContrary, for incompressible fluids the total mass flux\ncannot be constant but is dependent on the area where\nit is forced to flow through. Both pictures seem to be impossible to reconcile. Here in this paper we will present\na discussion of this seemingly contradiction leading to a\ndynamical stability criterion for the water bridge and a\n\n\f2\ncombined flow expression. This is in line with the idea\nof [17] where the bulk charges have been assumed to be\nrealized in a surface sheet. While there the migration\nof charges to the surface has been considered forming a\ncharged surface sheet, we adopt here the view point of homogeneously distributed bulk charges which flow in field\ndirection rather than forming a surface sheet.\nIn the absence of bulk charges the forces on the water\nstream are caused by the pressure due to the polarizability of water described by the high dielectric susceptibility \u01eb. This pressure leads to the catenary form of water\nbridge like a hanging chain [20]. While already the simplified model of [16] employing a capacitor picture leads\nto a critical field strength for the formation of the water\nbridge, the catenary model [20] has not been reported\nto yield such a critical field. In this paper we will show\nthat even the uncharged catenary provides indeed a minimal critical field strength for the water bridge formation\nin dependence on the length of the bridge. This critical field strength is modified if charges are present in the\nbridge which we will discuss here with the help of a new\ncharged catenary solution. This allows us to explain the\nasymmetry found in the bridge profile [3].\n\nB.\n\nOverview about the paper\n\nThe scenario of water or other dielectric bridges is\nthought as follows. Applying an electric field parallel\nto two attached vessels the water creeps up the beaker\nand form a bridge as it is nicely observed and pictured\nin [2]. This bridge can be elongated up to a critical field\nstrength and it forms a catenary which becomes asymmetric for higher gravitation to electric field ratios [3].\nThe critical value for stability is sensitively dependent\non ion concentrations breaking off already at very low\nconcentrations. The amount of mass flow through the\nbridge does not follow simple Ohmic transport as we will\nsee in this paper. The schematic picture of the water\nbridge is given in figure 1.\nIn this paper we want to advocate the following picture. Imaging a snapshot of the charges flowing through\nthe bridge we cannot decide whether the observed charges\nare due to static bulk charges or due to the floating motion of Ohmic bulk charges. This flow of charges within\nthe liquid bridge we can associate with a dynamical bulk\ncharge in the mass motion which is not covered by the\ndecay of Ohmic bulk charges discussed above. Such a\npicture is supported by the experimental observation of\npossible copper ion motion [21] and by the observation\nthat the water bridge is highly sensitive to additional external electric fields [22]. Strong fields even create small\ncone jets [2]. This dynamical bulk charge will lead us\nto the necessity to solve the catenary problem including\nbulk charges. Though charged membranes have been discussed in the literature [23], a new analytical solution of\nthe charged catenary is discussed in this paper.\nThe picture of Ohmic resistors and capacitor as de-\n\ndensity\ndielectric susceptibility\nsurface tension\nviscosity\nconductivity of\nclean water\nmolecular conductivity\nof NaCl\nheat capacity\n\n\u03c1\n\u01eb\n\u03c3s\n\u03b7\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u03c30 =\n\n103 kg/m3\n81\n7.27\u00d710\u22122 N/m\n1.5\u00d710\u22123 Ns/m2\n5\u00d710\u22126 A/Vm\n\n\u03bb = 12.6\u00d710\u22123 Am2 /Vmol\ncp =\n4.187 J/gK\n\nTABLE I: Variables and parameters used within this paper\nfor water.\n\nscribed above is not sufficient, as one can see from the\nobservation that adding a small amount of electrolytes to\nthe clean water destroys the water bridge almost immediately. In other words good conducting liquids should\nnot form a water bridge. We will derive an upper bound\nfor charges possibly carried in water in order to remain in\nstable liquid bridges. Though we present all calculations\nfor water parameters summarized in table I, the theory\napplies as well to any dielectric liquid in electric fields.\nFour theoretical questions have to be answered: (i)\nHow is the electric field influencing the height zmax water can creep up? (ii) What is the radius R(x) along the\nbridge? (iii) What is the form z = f (x) of the water\nbridge? What are the static constraints on the bridge?\n(iv) Which dynamical constraints can be found for possible bridge formation?\nWe will address all four questions with the help of four\nparameters composed of the properties summarized in\ntable I of water. The first one is the capillary height\nr\n2\u03c3s\na=\n= 3.8 mm\n(1)\n\u03c1g\nwith the surface tension \u03c3s , the particle density \u03c1 and\nthe gravitational acceleration g. The second parameter is\nthe water column height balancing the dielectric pressure\ncalled creeping height in the following\nb(E) =\n\n\u01eb0 (\u01eb \u2212 1)E 2\n= 7.22\u0112 2 cm\n\u03c1g\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the dimensionless electric field \u0112 is in units of\n104 V/cm. The third one is the dimensionless ratio of\nthe force density on the charges by the field to the gravitational force density\nc(\u03c1c , E) =\n\n\u03c1c E\n= 15.97\u0112 \u03c1\u0304c\n\u03c1g\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the charge density \u03c1\u0304c is in units of ng/l. For dynamical consideration the characteristic velocity\nu0 =\n\n\u03c1ga2\n\u2248 3.02m/s\n32\u03b7\n\n(4)\n\nwill be useful as the fourth parameter.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section we repeat shortly the standard treatment of creeping\n\n\f3\nheight and bubble radius of a liquid but add the pressure\nby the external electric field on the dielectric liquid. Then\nwe present the form of the bridge in terms of a new solution of the catenary equation due to bulk charges in\nsection IV. In section V we present the flow calculation\nproposing the picture of moving charged particles due to\nthe field which drag the neutral particles. This will lead\nto a dynamical stability criterion. Then we compare with\nthe experimental data and show the superiority of the\npresent treatment. Summary and conclusion ends up the\ndiscussion in section VI.\nII.\n\nz\nE\n\nz max \u03b1\n\u03b8\n\nx\n\nANSWER TO QUESTION (I): CREEPING\nHEIGHT AND (II): RADIUS OF BRIDGE\n\nWe start to calculate the possible creeping height and\nuse the pressure tensor for dielectric media [18]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\nik\n\u03c3 = \u2212p\u03b4ik \u2212\u03c3s\n+\n+\u01eb\u01eb0 Ei Ek \u2212 \u01eb\u0303\u01eb0 E 2 \u03b4ik (5)\nR1 R2\n2\nwhere p is the pressure in the system, R1 , R2 the principal\nradii of curvature such that the second term on the right\nhand side describe the contribution due to surface tension\nand the last terms are the parts due to the forces in the\ndielectric medium. We assume a density-homogeneous\nliquid such that for the dielectric susceptibility \u01eb\u0303 = \u01eb \u2212\n\u03c1(d\u01eb/d\u03c1)T \u2248 \u01eb. Further we consider first the stationary\nproblem which means that viscous forces can be neglected\nin (5).\nDenoting the components of the normal vector by ek ,\nthe stability condition between water (W) and air (A) is\ngiven by\nik k\ne(A)\n\u03c3(A)\n\n=\n\nk\nik\n\u2212\u03c3(W\n) e(W )\n\n=\n\nik k\ne(W ) .\n\u2212\u03c3(A)\n\n(6)\n\nSince the principal curvature of the tube is much larger\nradially than parallel, we have R2 \u223c \u221e and denoting\nthe coordinate in the direction of the height with z, the\npressure difference between water and air is pW \u2212 pL =\n\u03c1gz. We employ the boundary conditions for the normal\nE n and tangential E t components of the electric field\nn\nn\n= \u01ebE(W\nE(A)\n) = \u01ebEn ,\n\nt\nt\n= E(W\nE(A)\n) = Et .\n\n(7)\n\nand the balance (6) with (5) reads\n\u03c1gz +\n\n\u03c3s\n1\n= \u01eb0 (\u01eb \u2212 1)(\u01ebEn2 + Et2 ).\nR1\n2\n\n(8)\n\nPlease note that due to the migration of charges to the\nsurface one should consider a surface charge here in principle. We adopt thorough the paper the simplified picture that the charges remain bulk-like due to the preferred motion along the field and no surface charges are\nformed. The influence of such surface charges is considered as marginal since the curvature of the bridge is\nminimal leading to preferential tangential components of\nelectric fields.\n\nFIG. 2: The schematic picture of water bridge creeping up\nthe vessel due to the applied electric field.\n\nWe assume the electric field in x-direction such that\nEt = \u2212E cos \u03b1, En = E sin \u03b1 where z \u2032 (x) = tan \u03b1 is the\nincrease of the surface line of the water as illustrated in\nfigure 2. Using the parameters (1) and (2) we obtain\nfrom the stability condition (8) the differential equation\n2z \u2212 a2\n\nz \u2032\u2032\n\u01eb0 (\u01eb \u2212 1)\n(\u01ebEn2 + Et2 ) \u2248 b\n=\n\u20322\n3/2\n\u03c1g\n(1 + z )\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we used the approximation of small normal electric\nfields justified if there are no surface charges. This shows\nthe modification of the standard treatment of capillary\nheight by the applied field condensed on the right hand\nside. The first integral of (9) is\n1\nbz\nz2\n+\u221a\n\u2212 2 =1\n2\n\u20322\na\na\n1+z\n\n(10)\n\nand we have used the condition that for x \u2192 \u221e the surface is z = z \u2032 = 0. The explicit solution of the surface\ncurve z(x) is quite lengthy and not necessary here. Instead we can give directly the maximally reachable height\nin dependence on the electric field. Therefore we use the\nangle \u03b8 = 90 \u2212 \u03b1 of the liquid surface with the wall such\nthat z \u2032 (x) = \u2212 cot \u03b8 and from (10) we obtain\nr\nr\nb2\nb2\nb\nb\nz= +\n+a2 (1\u2212sin \u03b8) \u2264 +\n+a2 = zmax (11)\n2\n4\n2\n4\nwhich shows that without electric field the maximal\ncreeping height is just the capillary length (1) as it is\nwell known. The other extreme of very high fields leads\nto the field-dependent length (2) which justifies the name\ncreeping height. This answers the first question concerning creep heights.\nThe second question, how large the radius of the bridge\nis, one finds by equating the pressure due to surface tension with the gravitational force density\n\u03c3s\n= \u03c1gz \u2248 \u03c1g2R\nR\n\n(12)\n\n\f4\nsuch that the radius of the water bridge is at the beaker\nR \u2248 a/2.\n\n(13)\n\nWithout using this approximation we could express the\ncurvature again by differential expressions in z(x) defining a radial profile, as it can be found in text books [18].\nThe radius of the bridge at the beaker is nearly independent on the applied electric field but only dependent on\nthe surface tension and gravitational force. Along the\nbridge the radius will change with the applied electric\nfield as we will see later in section IV.C.\n\nB.\n\nStatic stability criteria\n\nWithout dynamical bulk charges, c = 0, d = 1, the\nsolution (15) is just the well known catenary [20]. The\nboundary condition (17) reads in this case\n2b\n2\u03be\nL\n=\ncosh\n\u2265 \u03bec = 1.5088...\nL\nL\n2\u03be\n\nwhich means that without bulk charges the condition for\na stable bridge is\nb>\n\nIII.\n\nANSWER TO QUESTION (III): LIQUID\nBRIDGE SHAPE\nA.\n\nCharged catenary\n\nNow we turn to the question which form the water\nbridge will take. Therefore we consider the center of\nmass line of the bridge being described by z = f (x)\nwith the ends at f (0) = f (L) = 0. The force densities are\np multiplied with the area and the length element\nds = 1 + f \u20322 dx to form the free energy. We have the\ngravitational force density\u03c1gf and the volume tension\n\u03c1gb as well as the force density by dynamical charges\n\u03c1c Ex which contributes. The surface tension is negligible here. The form of the bridge will be then determined\nby the extreme value of the free energy\nZL\n0\n\nF (x)dx = \u03c1g\n\nZL\n0\n\np\n(f (x) + b \u2212 cx) 1 + f \u20322 dx \u2192 extr.\n\n(14)\n\nwhere c is given by (3) and b defined in (2).\nAs shown in [24] and shortly outlines in appendix A\nthe solution can be represented parametrically as\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0012\nLd\nt Ld\n1\n\u2212cosh\nc\nt+\u03be\ncosh\n\u2212\n2\n1+c\n\u03be 2\u03be\n2\u03be\nx(t) = t \u2212 cf (t),\nt \u2208 (0, L).\n(15)\n\nf (t) =\n\n(18)\n\n1\nL\u03bec .\n2\n\n(19)\n\nTogether with (2) this condition provides a lower bound\nfor the electric field in order to enable a bridge of length\nL. This lower bound for an applied field appears obviously already for the standard catenary and has been not\ndiscussed so far.\nLets now return to the more involved case of bulk\ncharges and the new solution of charged catenary (15).\nThe field-dependent lower bound condition (17) is plotted in figure 3. One see that in order to complete (17)\nthe bulk charge parameter c has to be lower than the\nmaximal value of cm which reads\nc \u2264 cm (\u03be0 , b)\n\n(20)\n\nand which is plotted in the inset of figure 3. Remembering the definition of the bulk charge parameter (3) we\nsee that (20) sets an upper bound for the bulk charge in\ndependence on the electric field. The lower bound (19) of\nthe electric field for the case of no bulk charges is obeyed\nas well since the curve in the inset of figure 3 starts at\nb > L\u03bec /2 which is the lower bound already present for\nuncharged catenaries (19).\nThis completes the third question concerning static\nstability of the bridge. We have found a new catenary\nsolution even for bulk charges in the bridge.\n\nIV.

Here we want to propose the picture that\npossible charges in the water will move according to the\napplied electric field and will drag water particles such\nthat a mean mass motion starts. Due to the low Reynolds\nnumbers (40-100) for water we can consider the motion\nas laminar and we can neglect the convection term u\u2207u\nin the Navier Stokes equation [25] which reads then for\nthe stationary case\n\u03b7\u22072 u \u2212 \u2207p + \u03c1c E = 0.\n\n(21)\n\n\f5\n\n100\nL=1cm\n\n2\n\nI [ml/s]\n\n0\n1,5\n\n-2\ncm(\u03be0,b)\n\ncm(\u03be,b)\n\nL=2cm\n\n80\n\n-4\n\n1\n\n\u03c1c=0 ng/l\n\u03c1c=1 ng/l\n\n60\n\n40\n\n0,5\n\n20\n\n-6\n\n2b/L = \u03bec\n2b/L = \u03bec+2\n2b/L = \u03bec+4\n\n-8\n-10\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0\n\n0,8\n\n1 1,2 1,4 1,6 1,8\nb[L]\n\n0\n0\n\n0,4\n\n\u03be[L]\n\nb\n\u01eb0 (\u01eb \u2212 1)E 2\n=\n\u03c1g.\n2L\n2L\n\n(22)\n\nHere we can adopt the stationary pressure since the viscous pressure is accounted for by the Navier-Stoke equation. Assuming that the flow in the bridge has only a\ntransverse component which is radial dependent, u(r),\nwe can write the Navier Stokes equation (21) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b7 d\ndu\nb\nr\n+r\n+c =0\n(23)\n\u03c1g dr\ndr\n2L\nwith the resulting velocity profile in the direction of the\nbridge\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\nb\nr2\nu(r) \u2212 u(R) = 2u0\n(24)\n+c\n1\u2212 2\n2L\nR\nwhere R is the radius of the bridge and we have introduced the characteristic velocity (4). Please note that\nwe keep the undetermined velocity at the surface of the\nbridge u(R). We will assume in the follwoing that it is\nnegligible. The resulting profile (24) has the form of a\nPoiseullie flow but with an interplay between forces due\nto bulk charges and dielectric pressure in relation to gravity.\nThe mean current relative to the surface motion is easily calculated\n\nI = 2\u03c0\u03c1\n\n0\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0,6\n\nThe gradient of the electric pressure (8) can be given in\nthe direction of the bridge by\n\nZR\n\n2\nE [kV/cm]\n\nFIG. 3: The upper critical bound for the parameter c according to (17).

Since we have presently no good control\nover the surface velocity u(R) we approximate it in the\nfollowing as zero.\nPlease note that the bulk charge transport described\nby (3) leads to Ohmic behavior and the neutral particle\ntransport due to dielectric pressure leads to a quadratic\nfield dependence condensed in (2). The formula (26)\ncombines the effect of charge transport and neutral particle mass transport. It answers the problem raised in\nthe introduction how the two pictures can be brought\ntogether, the one of an incompressible fluids where the\nvelocity is dependent of the area and the one of Ohmic\ntransport where the velocity is only dependent on the\nelectric field.\nThe resulting total mass current is given in figure 4.\nThe current increases basically with the square of the\napplied field scaled by the bridge length. For additional\nbulk densities the mass flow is higher.\n\nB.\n\nComparison with the experiment\n\nTo convince the reader about the validity of the velocity formula (26) we compare now with the mass flow and\nthe charge flow measurements. The experimental values\nof Figure 4 in [2] are reported to be 40mg/s for a bridge\n\n\f6\nU@kVD\n14\n13\n\nU@kVD\n20\nHOhmic 1013 \u03a1cL\n18\n\nI=40ml\u0090s\n\nI=0.5 mA\n\n12\n16\n11\n14\n10\n12\n\n9\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n\u03a1c@ng\u0090lD\n\nFIG. 5: The necessary applied voltage versus bulk charge\ndensities in order to maintain a mass current of 40ml/s. Following [2] the length of the bridge was L = 1cm and the\ndiameter 2.5mm. The result using the flow expression (26) of\nthe present paper (solid line) is compared to an Ohmic transport (dashed line). For the latter one the bulk charge has\nbeen multiplied with 13 orders of magnitude.\n\nof 1cm length, a diameter of 2.5mm for the stationary\nregime. For this situation we compare in figure 5 the\nresults obtained from (26) with a pure Ohmic transport\nusing the lowest-order conductivity expression\n\u03c1c\n\u03c3=\u03bb\n+ \u03c30\neNA\n\n(27)\n\nwhere for clean water the conductivity is \u03c30 , \u03bb is the\nmolecular conductivity of the solved charge (electrolyte),\nand NA the Avogadro constant, see table I. We see that\nour formula (26) leads to a realistic necessary voltage which was 12.5kV in the experiment - even if no bulk\ncharge is presented. In contrast, for the Ohmic transport\none has to assume 13 orders of magnitude higher bulk\ncharges to come into the same range. This illustrates the\nadvantage of the here presented model.\nConsidering the charge transport we do not expect\nsuch big differences of our model to the pure Ohmic picture since the charged particles matters. To this end we\ncompare the applied voltage versus bridge length with\na constant charge current as it was given in figure 6 of\n[2]. In figure 6 we compare the result from (26) with the\npure Ohmic transport. We use a bulk charge of 2.3ng/l.\nIn order to obtain a comparable Ohmic result we had to\nmultiply the bulk charge with a factor of 3 \u00d7 103 which illustrates the difference between our model and the Ohmic\ntransport.\nWhile the difference in charge transport is not very\nsignificant provided the fact that the conductivity of water varies in the order of 3 magnitudes, the mass flow of\nfigure 5 has shown that our result here with (26) is superior since it considers the drag of neutral particles due\nto dielectric pressure together with the charge transport.\nHaving the current at hand one estimates the Joule\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nL@mmD\n16\n\nFIG. 6: The necessary applied voltage versus bridge length\nin order to maintain a charge current of 0.5mA.

For the Ohmic transport the\nbulk charge has been multiplied with a factor of 3 \u00d7 103 .

This is much lower than\nour result. We would obtain here 2-3 orders of magnitude higher heating rates. Please note that the cooling\nmechanisms like evaporating and cooling due to water\nflow is beyond the present consideration. Since these are\nprobably the major cooling effects in the experiments [26]\nwe cannot compare seriously the theoretical heating rate\nwith the experimentally observed ones.\nC.\n\nProfile of bridge\n\nLet us now calculate the profile of the bridge along\nthe length. We consider to this end the total mass flow\nof the bridge and neglect the viscous term compared to\nthe kinetic energy (which includes part of the convection\nterm), u\u2207u = 12 \u2207u2 + curlu \u00d7 u \u2248 21 \u2207u2 . Then one\narrives at the Bernoulli equation\n\u03c1\n\n1\n1\nv2\nv(x)2\n+\u03c1gf (x)+\u03c3s (\n)\u2212\u03c1c Ex = \u03c1 +\u03c3s . (29)\n2\nR(x)\n2\nR\n\nHere we have neglected the curvature of the bridge compared to the curvature due to the radius and have compared the position-dependent radius R(x) and velocity v(x) in the bridge with the situation at the beaker\n(x = 0). The Bernoulli equation (29) can be rewritten in\nterms of the capillary height (1) and the velocity (26) as\nf (x) \u2212 cx =\n\na2\nv 2 \u2212 v 2 (x)\n+a\u2212\n2g\n2R(x)\n\n(30)\n\n\f7\nwhich determines the radius R(x) from the profile of the\nbridge (15) and the velocity v(x) if we observe the current\nconservation through an area\n\nThe results are presented figures 7 and 8. We plot the\nshape of the bridge, the radius and the velocity together\nwith a 3D plot. The case of no bulk charges which leads\nto the standard catenary can be found in figure 7 and\nfigure 7 shows the situation for extreme bulk charges almost at the stability edge (20). We see a deformation of\nthe catenary due to the applied field. This deformation\nis observed, e.g. if an additional field is brought near\nthe bridge [2, 22]. One sees that the radius is becoming smaller at one end of the bridge accompanied with\nhigher velocities as it is known from falling water pipes\n[27]. The bulk charge leads to deformations of this profile which are exaggerated in the plot due to the choice\nof unequal scales.\nInterestingly such asymmetry is experimentally observed [2], where after 3 min of operation the asymmetry\nfor the bridge of 0.9cm length ranges from a diameter of\n2.1mm to 2.6mm. This is in agreement with the profile\ncalculated in figure 8. Also the measured asymmetry in\nthe left and right catenary angle [3] in glycerine can be\nexplained with the present model.\nD.\n\nf [L]\n\n-0.04\n-0.06\n-0.08\n0.2\n0.19\n\nr [L]\n\n(31)\n\n-0.02\n\n0.18\n0.17\n0.16\n6.5\n\nv [m/s]\n\nR(x)2 v(x) = R2 v.\n\n0\n\n6\n5.5\n5\n4.5\n4\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx[L]\n\nDynamical stability\n\nWe turn now to the question of dynamical stability\nof the flow and consider the motion of water together\nwith the motion of charged particles characterized by the\nmass mi and charge ei .

The lower minimal\nlength of the bridge at a given field strength and bulk\ncharge is provided by the dynamical condition (37). For\nno bulk charge the possible range of lengths of the bridge\nstarts at zero and is limited by the upper length (19).\nIf there are charges present, there is a minimal length\nrequired to have a stable bridge.\nFrom the 3D plot in figure 10 one can see that for\nfinite charges and for fixed bridge lengths there is a lower\n\n\f9\n50 ng/l. As a further an asymmetric profile in the diameter along the bridge is obtained which was observed by\nasymmetric heating.\nFor the dynamical consideration a picture is proposed\nof dragged liquid particles due to the motion of the\ncharged ones besides the ponderomotoric forces due to\nthe dielectric character of the liquid. The resulting consideration of dynamical stability restricts the possible parameter range of bridge formation. The resulting mass\nflow combines the charge transport and the neutral mass\nflow dragged by dielectric pressure and is in agreement\nwith the experimental data.\nThe presented simple classical theory applies for\ncharged liquids as long as the Reynolds number is such\nlow that laminar flow can be assumed.\nAcknowledgments\n\nFIG. 10: The range of possible water bridges in dependence\non the bridge length, the electric field and the electrolyte bulk\ncharges.\n\nand an upper critical field where bridges can only be\nstable.

We solve the variation problem (14)\nZL\n0\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe formation of water bridges between two vessels\nwhen an electric field is applied has been investigated\nmacroscopically. Electrohydrodynamics is sufficient to\ndescribe the phenomena in agreement with the experimental data. The four necessary parameters which are\nbuild up from microscopic properties of the charged liquid are the capillary height (1), the creeping height (2),\nthe dimensionless ratio between field and gravitational\nforce density (3), and the characteristic velocity (4).\nAs new contribution to the discussion, an exact solution has been found of a charged catenary. This leads\nto a static stability criterion for possible charges in the\nliquid dependent on the applied field strengths and on\nthe length of the bridge. With no bulk charges present\nthe maximal bridge length is determined and no minimal\nlength occurs. This changes if bulk charges are present.\nThen also a minimal length is required.
