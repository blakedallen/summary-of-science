The present observation suggests a borderline of superhump excitation in VY Scl-type stars between\nmass ratios q=0.43 (MV Lyr) and q=0.60 (KR Aur).\nKey words: accretion, accretion disks - stars: individual (KR Aurigae) - stars: novae, cataclysmic\nvariables - stars: oscillations\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCataclysmic variables (CVs) are close binary systems\nconsisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary\ntransferring matter via the Roche lobe overflow. The resultant accretion disk becomes thermally stable in systems with high mass-transfer rates (\u1e40 ). Such systems\nare called novalike (NL) stars, because they lack outbursts\ncharacteristic to dwarf novae [see Osaki (1996) for a review]. Among NL stars, there exists a small group which\nshows a temporary reduction or cessation of \u1e40 from the\nsecondary. These systems are called VY Scl-type stars or\nanti-dwarf novae (Warner 1995).\nAlthough accretion disks in NL stars are thermally\nstable, the disk can be tidally unstable (Osaki 1995;\nOsaki 1996). Numerical simulations have shown that\nthis instability (tidal instability: Whitehurst 1988) only\nappears below a certain mass ratio (q = M2 /M1 ): q <\n0.25 \u2212 0.33 depending on calculations (Hirose, Osaki 1990;\nWood et al. 2000; Whitehurst, King 1991; Molnar,\nKobulnicky 1992; Murray 1998). In recent years, several systems above this stability limit are known to show\nsuperhumps (Patterson 1999). Since many of them are\nVY Scl-type stars, there has been a theoretical interpretation that accretion disks can be tidally unstable upon\nvariation of \u1e40 (Murray et al. 2000) even in intermediate q\nsystems. Temporary appearance of superhump signals in\na recent low state of a VY Scl-type star, BZ Cam (Kato,\nUemura 2001) may support this interpretation. However,\nobservations have not yet fully illustrated the upper q limit\nfor superhumpers in VY Scl-type stars. KR Aur (q=0.60)\nis an ideal system to examine such a condition, since this\nsystem has the smallest q among VY Scl-type stars which\n\nhave not been reported to show (or studied for) superhumps.\n2.\n\nPast Studies of KR Aurigae\n\nKR Aur is a variable star originally discovered by M.\nPopova in 1960. Popova originally classified the object as\na 'unusual nova' (cf. Duerbeck 1987). The object has received much attention since Popova, Vitrichenko (1977)\nclaimed, from the detection of a large infall velocity\nof 3200 km s\u22121 in its H\u03b2 line, that the object may\nbe a solitary black hole accreting interstellar matter.\nPopova, Vitrichenko (1978) further reported a long-term\nlight curve, which could not fit any existing classifications of variable stars, a large radial velocity (+130\nkm s\u22121 ), a steep Balmer decrement, and a spectral energy distribution approximated by F\u03bd =const. Popova,\nVitrichenko (1978) considered that these features are\nalso consistent with an accreting black hole. However,\nDoroshenko et al. (1977) reported that time-scales of continuum variation (a few hours to a few tens of seconds)\nand that U BV colors resemble those of CVs, known as\n\"novalike\" stars at the time of the reporting.\nDoroshenko, Terebizh (1978) studied short-term light\nvariation, and detected \u223c0.4 mag variations with timescales of several minutes. Liller (1980) studied archival\nplates, and obtained the first long-term light curve of\nthis object. Liller (1980) showed that KR Aur sometimes show excursions to faint states (which was also noted\nby Popova, Vitrichenko (1978)), but no clear periodicity\nwas found. Popov (1982) reported an ongoing new fading\nepisode.\nThe nature of the object was revealed with spec-\n\n\f2\n\nT. Kato, R. Ishioka, and M.

A single snapshot observation during a low state was taken on 1998\nDecember 21, using an unfiltered ST-7 camera attached\nto a 25-cm Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. All systems give\nmagnitudes close to Rc . The images were dark-subtracted,\n\nKR Aur\n\n2.5\n\nmagnitude\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nRelative\n\ntroscopic observations by Shafter (1983) and Hutchings\net al. (1983), who detected a binary motion from radial\nvelocity study. The object was thus confirmed to be a\nCV. Williams (1983) showed that the object shows a spectrum typical of a CV with relatively weak emission lines.\nHowever, since the characteristics of light variations did\nnot fit any known subclass of CVs, long-term light variations were subsequently studied in detail mainly from\nphotographic survey materials (G\u00f6tz 1983; G\u00f6tz 1984;\nG\u00f6tz 1985; G\u00f6tz 1986; G\u00f6tz 1987; G\u00f6tz 1988; G\u00f6tz 1989;\nG\u00f6tz 1990; Fujino et al. 1987; Liller, Popova 1984; Popov\net al. 1994; Antov et al. 1996). All of these observations\nshowed rather erratic light curves, and occasional fadings\nwith time-scales of months to a few years. From these\ncharacteristics, KR Aur is now considered to belong to\nVY Scl-type novalike CVs, which occasionally show fading episodes (cf. Warner, van Citters 1974; Garnavich,\nSzkody 1988; Greiner 1998; Leach et al. 1999). KR Aur\nwas also independently selected as an ultraviolet-excess\nobject (KUV 06126+2836: Kondo et al. 1984), for which\nWegner, Swanson (1990) gave a spectroscopic classification as a CV.\nPopov, Antov (1989) reported rapid variations in KR\nAur. Biryukov, Borisov (1990) further studied this star\nand reported the presence of 25-min periodicity. The light\ncurve presented by Biryukov, Borisov (1990) suggests a\nmoderate degree of coherence.\n\n4\n\n4.5\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nBJD - 2452200\n\nFig. 2.

The light curve shows predominant low states (durations: several months to two\nyears) when the object is fainter than mag 14, and occasional high states when the object is typically between\nmag 13 and 14. Such a high occurrence of low states is\nrelatively rare among VY Scl-type stars (Greiner 1998).\nThe long-term behavior of the system most resembles \"superminimum\" of MV Lyr (Robinson et al. 1981; Wenzel,\nFuhrmann 1983; Fuhrmann 1985). At a closer look, the\nsystem underwent a small dwarf nova-like outburst around\nJD 2450745\u20132450755. The object then became inactive.\nBefore the fully recovery, the object underwent a rather\ncomplex brightening around JD 2451580\u20132451630. This\nbehavior is quite reminiscent of the fading and recovery\nprocesses observed in MV Lyr (Pavlenko 1998; Shugarov,\nPavlenko 1998; Pavlenko, Shugarov 1999). Although such\nbehavior is unexpected for variable mass-transfer rates on\na usual CV (Honeycutt et al. 1994), Leach et al. (1999)\nshowed that, in the presence of heating from a hot white\ndwarf, the irradiation on the accretion disk suppresses\nthe thermal instability, which can reproduce the observed\nlight curve of VY Scl-type systems. From these observations, we propose that MV Lyr and KR Aur comprise the\nmost \"active\" subgroup of VY Scl-type stars.\nFigure 2 presents overall light variation of KR Aur\nin 2001 November\u2013December drawn from observations\nin table 1. Although some irregular variation is superimposed, no major \"flare\"-like brightening (cf. Popova,\nVitrichenko 1978) was observed.\n1\n\nh http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/ i.\n\n20\n\n0\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nFrequency (1/d)\nFig. 5.

There was no common\nperiod between the nightly observations.\n\n4.2.\n\nSuperhumps\n\nFigure 3 presents a period analysis of the November\n23\u2013December 17 data, after subtracting a linear fit to the\noverall light curve. The upper and lower panels represent the results of period analysis with Phase Dispersion\nMinimization (Stellingwerf 1978) and with the CLEAN\nalgorithm (Roberts et al. 1987), respectively. The orbital\nperiod is marked with a tick on the upper panel. No significant coherent periodicity was detected at or near the\norbital period, indicating that no detectable periodic or\nquasi-periodic variations related to orbital modulations or\nsuperhumps were present (see also subsection 4.3).\nThe absence of superhumps makes a clear contrast\nto other VY Scl-type stars with superhumps (TT\nAri: Udalski (1988); Skillman et al. (1998); Andronov\net al. (1999); Kraicheva et al. (1999); Stanishev,\nKraicheva (2001), MV Lyr: Skillman et al. (1995), V751\nCyg: Patterson et al. (2001)). This finding suggests that\nthe mechanism proposed by Murray et al. (2000) is ineffective in the mass ratio of KR Aur. We propose that there is\na borderline of superhump excitation between mass ratios\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nPhotometric Study of KR Aur\n\n5\n\nq=0.43 (MV Lyr) and q=0.60 (KR Aur) in VY Scl-type\nstars. Future determination of mass ratios in longer Porb\nsystems (i.e. candidates for systems with higher q than\nMV Lyr) BZ Cam, V751 Cyg and TT Ari is expected to\nprovide a more stringent constraint to this limit (see table\n2 for a summary of superhumps and binary parameters of\nVY Scl-type stars).\n\nsection 4.2). Aside from the lack of superhumps, these\nvariations look remarkably similar to those of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in another VY\nScl-type star, TT Ari (e.g. Mardirossian et al. 1980;\nJensen et al. 1983; Hollander, van Paradijs 1992; Tremko\net al. 1996; Andronov et al. 1999).\nFigure 5 shows power spectra of nightly observations.\nOn some nights (November 23, 30, December 11), an increased power around the frequencies 100\u2013150 d\u22121 (corresponding to the periods of 10\u201315 min) was observed.\nThere was no common period between the nightly observations. This finding confirms the quasi-periodic nature of the short-term variations. We have not been able\nto confirm the presence of 25-min periodicity claimed by\nBiryukov, Borisov (1990). The periods of the presently\nobserved QPOs are close to the periodicities (480\u2013780 s)\nrecorded by Singh et al. (1993). We have also confirmed\nnight-to-night variation of dominant periods as was originally claimed by Singh et al. (1993).\nWe also note that the overall profiles of short-term variations (figure 4) and the nightly variation of the power\nspectra are also similar to those observed in the peculiar\nsymbiotic binary V694 Mon (Michalitsianos et al. 1993;\nDobrzycka et al. 1996; Ishioka et al. 2001).\nThere are two major types of \"quasi-periodic\" oscillations in CVs: dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs), which are\noscillations observed only in dwarf nova outbursts, having periods of 19\u201329 s, and have long (several tens to\n\u223c100 wave numbers) coherence times (Robinson 1973;\nSzkody 1976; Hildebrand et al. 1980), and (in a narrower sense) QPOs (for a review, see Warner (1995)).\nThe present QPOs in KR Aur correspond to the latter\nclassification. Several models have been proposed to account for QPOs, including vertical or radial oscillations of\nthe accretion disk (Kato 1978), reprocessing of the light\nby the orbiting blobs (Patterson 1979), non-radial pulsations of the accretion disk (Papaloizou, Pringle 1978;\nvan Horn, Wesemael 1980), radial oscillation of the accretion disk (Cox 1981; Blumenthal et al. 1984; Okuda,\nMineshige 1991; Okuda et al. 1992), excitation of trapped\noscillations around the discontinuity of physical parameters (Yamasaki et al. 1995). There has been also a suggestion that the magnetism of the white dwarf can be responsible for some kinds of QPOs (Mikolajewski et al. 1990).\nAlthough present observations are not able to constrain\nthe origin of QPOs, a future search for coherent X-ray,\nultraviolet or optical pulsations, which are a well-known\nsignature of a magnetic white dwarf, would be helpful in\ndiscriminating the possibilities.\n\n4.3.\n\n4.4.\n\nTable 2.

A few other SW Sex stars [PX And (Still\net al. 1995); BH Lyn (Hoard, Szkody 1997)] are claimed to show\nsome degree of low/high state transitions (mainly from spectroscopic\nobservations). Such a variation may more represent a change in the\ndisk state (cf. Groot et al. 2001) rather than VY Scl-type temporary reduction or cessation of \u1e40 from the secondary. Some DQ Her\nstars (intermediate polars) also show temporary fadings (Garnavich,\nSzkody 1988; Hessman 2000), but they are not usually considered\nas VY Scl-type stars.\nReferences: VY Scl: Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Pais et al.

This type of energy\nrelease in visual wavelengths would be a promising candidate for explaining flickering in CVs. Further quantitative comparisons with numerical simulations and observed\nproperties in CVs will be a next step toward understanding flickering in CVs.\n\n0\n\n-.5\n\nlog power\n\n-1\n\nf -1.63\n\n-1.5\n\n[Vol. ,\n\n-2\n\n-2.5\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\n-3\n.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\nlog frequency (1/d)\n\nFig. 6.

Above the frequency log f (d\u22121 )=1.5, the PSD is proportional to f \u22121.63 .\n\nsince the 1940's (see Bruch 1992 for an extensive historical review), their physical origin has not been well\nunderstood. Historically, Warner, Nather (1971) demonstrated that flickering almost disappeared during eclipses\nof the eclipsing dwarf nova U Gem. This finding indicated that the origin of flickering is strongly associated with the hot spot (the stream impact point on\nthe accretion disk). James (1987) noted the presence of\npower law-type frequency dependence, and proposed that\na multiple scattering from the flickering source (hot spot)\nis responsible for this frequency dependence. More recently, Bruch (1991) more extensively studied the properties of flickering, and summarized an observational review\n(Bruch 1992). From the analysis of frequency and color\ndependencies, Bruch (1992) and Bruch, Duschl (1993)\nsuggested that the inner part of the accretion disk (rather\nthan the hot spot) is more responsible for flickering. More\ndirect observational evidence for a major contribution\nfrom the inner accretion disk to flickering has been demonstrated through eclipse observations of CVs (HT Cas:\nWelsh, Wood 1995; Bruch 2000, Z Cha: Bruch 1996). It\nis now widely believed that the originally proposed idea\nof stream impact-type flickering (Warner, Nather 1971)\napplies to a only limited sample of CVs, or contributes to\na small extent to overall flickering activity, and that most\nof CVs have a strong concentration of flickering activity\ntoward the inner accretion disk (Bruch 1996).\nIn order to reproduce this power-law spectrum,\nYonehara et al. (1997) proposed a superposition of \"shots\"\nin a self-organized critical state (SOC), which was originally introduced to explain time variations in blackhole candidates (BHCs) (e.g. Mineshige et al. 1994b;\nMineshige et al. 1994a; Takeuchi et al. 1995; Kawaguchi\net al. 2000). Taking this analogy into account, the power\nlaw-type temporal properties of the short-term variations\nin KR Aur present additional support for the possibility\n\nWe photometrically observed the VY Scl-type cataclysmic variable KR Aurigae after its final rise from the\nfading episode in 2000\u20132001. We show that the longterm light curve of KR Aur is densely populated with\nlow states, making KR Aur an exceptionally active VY\nScl-type star. The object showed a complex recovery process from a faint state, which may be understood as the\nresult from heating on the accretion disk from a hot white\ndwarf. Time-resolved observation during the high state\nrevealed that the light curve is dominated by persistent\nshort-term variation with time-scales of minutes to tens of\nminutes. On some nights, quasi-periodic variations with\nperiods of 10\u201315 min were observed. No coherent variation was detected. The power spectral density of the\nvariation has a power law component (f \u22121.63 ) at high frequencies. The temporal properties of the short-term variations in KR Aur present additional support for the possibility that flickering in CVs may be better understood\nas a result of self-organized critical state as in black-hole\ncandidates. Contrary to the large-amplitude short-term\nvariations, the light curve lacks \"superhump\"-type signals, which are relatively frequently seen in VY Scl-type\nsystems. The present observation suggests a borderline of\nsuperhump excitation in VY Scl-type stars between mass\nratios q=0.43 (MV Lyr) and q=0.60 (KR Aur).\nThe authors are grateful to observers who reported vital\nobservations to VSNET.
