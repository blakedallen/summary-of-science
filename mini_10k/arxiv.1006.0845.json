The different media types exchanged by\nthese applications have significantly different traffic requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, jitter and reliability, and require different demand service guarantees from\nthe underlying communication network to offer an acceptable performance.\nWireless networks have also seen a tremendous growth\nin their usage and consequent demand for multimedia applications. The 2nd Generation cellular systems like GSM,\nwhich offered circuit-switched voice services, are now\nevolving towards 3rd Generation (3G) and 4th Generation\nsuch as LTE and Pre-WiMax systems that can transmit\nhigh-speed data, video and multimedia-traffic [11],[12],\n[17].\nAlthough ATM has become very popular as the backbone and Backhaul of high-bandwidth networks networks\nbecause of the QoS guarantees it can offer, it has not been\nnot been widely accepted as a substitute for the IP stacks\nused on the Internet. However, the telecommunications\nindustry has been migrating from ATM to IP, ensuring that\nthe IP network can support new services and future traffic\ngrowth, and allows users take advantage of low-cost\nbandwidth from telecommunications providers.\nFor many future applications, the delay-variation (jitter)\nremains one of the most important metric of quality of service, and can have a greater impact on the quality than the\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nnetwork latency and packet loss. Even the small amounts\nof delay variation or jitter introduced by the network can\nhave a significant impact on application performance. With\nthe evolution towards all-IP architecture [11], [13], [21],\noperators are thinking seriously about dimensioning and\noptimization tools based on simple and robust delay and\njitter models.\nUsually, the average network delay and throughput\nhave been used as metrics to optimize the network cost and\nperformance in current design tools [3][4]. This is simply\ndue to the absence of a robust and simple formula for the\njitter so that current network planning and design techniques are mostly based on average delay or loss constraints simply because they can often be easily calculated.\nAs a consequence, the effect of jitter on network structure and operation is not well understood. Getting some\nqualitative understanding of this QoS requirement will be\nonly possible when we have a fast evaluation method for\njitter. We present here a first experimental validation of the\njitter model presented in [1]. We can use it to gain insight\ninto the impact of the jitter on the network performance. In\nparticular we focus on the impact of the jitter on the other\nQoS metrics such as: the throughput and the packet loss.\nThe objective of the paper is the benchmarking, modeling and analyzing the jitter constraint on Pre-WiMax technology for avionics applications in realistic environments.\nThe live measurements of Pre-WiMax QoS parameters are\nprovided under the SCA project (Communication Systems\nfor Avionics).

Section II provides a brief overview of Pre-WIMAX technology. The analytical relationship between traffic load,\nthroughput, packet loss and average jitter is given in section III. In section IV, we describe the measurement platform and some live results of QoS parameters in PreWiMax environments. The last section draws some conclusions.\n\n2 OVERVIEW OF PRE-WIMAX TECHNOLOGY\nPre-WIMAX technology selected for avionics applications has shown rapid progress and has been widely used\nto help people doing their daily activities. It has been developed to transmit different types of services data, text\nand video.\nFixed Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) is a promising technology which can offer high speed voice, video\nand data service up to the customer [19],[17]. Due to the\nabsence of any standard specification, earlier BWA systems were based on standard 802.11h-Hyperlan 3, which\nallows 1W of emitted power rather than 0.1W of WiFi.\nThis can improve performance in many situations..\nThe Wireless MAN standard specifies a Medium\nAccess Control (MAC) layer and a set of PHY layers to\nprovide fixed and mobile Broadband Wireless Access\n(BWA) over a broad range of frequencies. The PreWiMAX has adopted IEEE 802.11h-Hyperlan 3 OFDM\nPHY layer for the equipment manufacturer due to its robust performance in multi-path transmission [14].\nThe different advantages offered by Pre-WiMax technology such as: coverage, bandwidth, QoS, etc. make it a\ngood choice for the intermediate technology between WiFi and WiMax. Thus, results provided for pre-WiMax can\nbe extended to the broadband technologies previously\ncited.\n\nrenewal process (e.g.,[5][6][7][8][9]). It is calculated for discrete time processes and FCFS multiplexing operation.\nIn this paper, we adopt the IETF [22] definition of jitter.\nIt is based on the transit delay of successive packets between the entry and the exit network nodes. Let Tj\nrepresents the delay experienced by the jth packet going\nthrough a queue. The difference of transit time between\ntwo consecutive packets of a tagged flow can be written as\n\nJ j = T j +1 \u2212 T j\n\nwhich can be positive or negative. The average end-to-end\ndelay jitter is then given by the expected absolute value of\nthis random variable\n\nJ = E [| T j +1 - T j |]\n\n(2)\n\nWe consider a single node with infinite buffer and a\nFCFS discipline. There are different streams of packets arriving to this node. Define,\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u03bb: the total arrival rate\nC: the link bandwidth\n\u03bb: the total traffic load\n\nIn [1] we have shown and validated by simulation that\nthe end-to-end jitter of a tagged flow produced by a single\nnode can be approximated by the following formula:\n1\u2212 \u03c1\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\n1 \uf8ec\nJ =\n1\u2212 e \u03c1\nC\u2212\u03bb \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\u2212 \u03c1\n\uf8eb 1\u2212 \u03c1\n\u2212\n\uf8ec\n+e \u03c1\n\uf8ec \u03c1\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f8\n\n(3)\n\nNote that this formula depends on the traffic parameters\nonly through the bandwidth, the arrival rate, and the traffic\nload.\nOn the other hand, the relation that connects the loss\nprobability BT, the average overall throughput XT of the\nresource, and the arrival rate is given in [2]\n\n3. PERFORMANCE AND MODELING\nDelay jitter is an important QoS metric for real-time\nservices, such as VoIP traffic and avionics applications. It\ncan result in consecutive packet experiencing excessive\ndelays and/or consecutive packet loss. Both events lead\nto a marked deterioration in the subjective quality of interactive and real-time services.\nUnfortunately, this parameter is difficult to estimate due\nto data traffic characteristics and the transient queuing effects in the network. In this section we focus on performance behavior of delay and delay-jitter at packet level by\nmeans of an approximate analytical solution. Our aim is to\nprovide an analytical expression for the delay-jitter in function of the traffic load, bandwidth and latency. This is done\nby taking into account the Poisson nature of the background traffic.\nThere has been much work during the 1990's on the estimation of cell delay jitter for ATM networks. Most of\nthese results are based on queuing systems and assume\nthat the tagged stream is originally periodic or a general\n\n(1)\n\nBT =\n\n\u03bb \u2212 XT\n\u03bb\n\n(4)\n\nFrom equations (3) and (4) we conclude the relationship between the arrival rate, the throughput and the loss\nrate:\n123-\n\nWhen the overall throughput increases then\nthe jitter decreases.\nWhen the overall throughput increases then\nthe loss rate decreases.\nWhen the overall packet loss increases then\nthe jitter increases.\n\nThese relationships allow understanding and explaining some phenomena, observed in live measurements,\nwhich can highly affect the end-to-end network performance. Typically, we can conclude that the jitter has a\nbehavior opposite that of the throughput, and the same\nbehavior as the loss rate.\n\n\f101\n\n4. MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we present some QoS results carried on\nlive measurements. The Pre-WIMAX technology has been\ntested to measure various parameters such as: jitter,\nthroughput, and packet loss.\n\n4.1 Measurements Platform Description\nA sectorial antenna (120\u00b0 aperture), was placed with\nthe AU (Pre-WiMax Access Unit, equivalent to a WiFi\nAccess Point) on the roof of an Airbus building near the\nairport tracks. A vehicle was moving on the service roads\nof the airport (all around the tracks), recording logs every\nsecond. An application was developed by M3System to\nrecord:\n\u2212 time stamps,\n\u2212 position (with integrity level),\n\u2212 performance (Iperf) logs (bandwidth, jitter, lost\npackets, ...),\n\u2212 router logs.\n\nFigure 1. Airport Pre-Wimax tests conditions\nOn Figure 1, the following color code is used:\n\u2212 Yellow dots \u0002 ping OK.\n\u2212 Green dots \u0002 Iperf measurements (TCP or UDP)\nrate greater than 800kB/s.\n\u2212 Red dots \u0002 ping NOK or rate lesser than\n200kB/s.\n\u2212 Orange dots \u0002 intermediate rates.\n\u2212 No dots \u0002 No ping or Iperf logs (means that no\nsignal is received).\nThe 120\u00b0 aperture of the antenna is represented by green\nlines and a masked area (due to another Airbus building)\nby blue lines. The total width of the Airport is 5.35 km.\n\n4.2 Impact of the mobility on communications\nAs shown in Figure 1, the vehicle was doing round\ntrips at a distance varying from 540 m to 1570 m. TCP and\nUDP bandwidths were recorded for the test vehicle\n(shown in Figure 2) moving at different speeds.\n\nFigure 2. Measurement Platform\na) Measurements for Static Point\nFirst, we made our live measurements of the quality\nof service from a static point in order to define the behavior of each parameter of performance and to extract a\nrelationship connecting these QoS parameters.\nThe measurements for realistic scenarios are investigated to show the impact of distance between Base Station and client station on the QoS parameters of PreWimax technology.\n\nFigure 3. QoS parameters in static point B\nThe QoS metrics are firstly evaluated for a stationary\ndistance of 1570m. At this point, we remark on Figure 3\nthat end-to-end jitter and throughput are showing an opposite behavior. Periods of high jitter, at around 200\nseconds, correspond to low throughput, and vice versa.\nThese fluctuations of QoS parameters are theoretically\nproved according to the relationship described by analytical model (equation 3 and 4).\n\nb) Measurements for mobile vehicle with Constant\nSpeed\nNext, the measurements of QoS parameters are performed in mobile environment at a constant speed of 50\nkm/h. Figure 4 illustrates the measured jitter, throughput\nand packet loss in this case. As can be seen, the jitter and\npacket loss variations that are opposite that of the\nthroughput. In fact, regardless of the vehicle speed a high\nlevel of jitter can be due to a marked increase in packets\nloss and to a low throughput level.. We conclude that the\nvehicle speed has an impact on the QoS parameter values\nbut not on the relationship between these metrics.\n\n\f102\n\nFigure 6. Throughput variation for different speeds\n\nFigure 4. QoS parameters for 50km/h\n\nc) Measurements for variable Speed\nIn this section, the measurements results are obtained\nfor different speeds of the vehicle between 10km/h and\n50km/h.\n\nFigure 7. Jitter variation for different speeds\n\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nFigure 5. Speeds versus time\nIt is well known that mobility has a significant impact\non the performance perceived by mobile stations. This\nimpact is clearly shown within figure 6 and 7 when varying the mobile speed between 10 and 50 km/h. By changing the speed as shown on Figure 5, we can observe a\nfluctuation of the throughput presented in Figure 6, and\nthe opposite fluctuation for the jitter variation in Figure 7.\nThis is theoretically explained through the relationships\nconnecting jitter, packet loss and throughput.\n\nFor Pre-WIMAX technology, the jitter factor impacts\nthe performance of system and Quality of service. In fact,\nthe jitter and packet loss presented the same behavior for\nstatic and mobile environments. The qualitative behavior\nof the jitter and the throughput predicted by the analytical model is confirmed by our live measurements at various speeds. The model can then be used by operator to\nimprove the main factors of quality of service needed by\nairlines companies. The main application of this relationship can be a component of all-IP network optimization\nalgorithms where the end-to-end jitter, packet loss,\nthroughput and latency appear as a set of QoS constraints.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe measurements are provided for SCA project, the authors are indebted to the DGCIS (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la\nComp\u00e9titivit\u00e9, de l'Industrie et des Services) for its support.
