Additionally, an early phase of metal injection may qualitatively change the characteristic mass of star\nformation (Bromm et al. 2001; Schneider et al. 2002; Mackey,\nBromm, & Hernquist 2002). The transition between zerometallicity star formation and \"normal\" star formation has important implications, e.g., for the expected redshift distribution\nof gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; Bromm & Loeb 2002), for reionization (Wyithe & Loeb 2002d; Cen 2002), and for the chemical\nabundance patterns of low-metallicity stars (Qian & Wasserburg 2001, 2002).\nStars produced metals inside galaxies, and one must invoke\nsome type of outflow to transport them throughout the IGM.\nSimple dynamical removal cannot pollute the large regions we\nobserve (Aguirre et al. 2001c; but see Gnedin 1998). Radiation pressure-driven dust outflows may suffice (Aguirre et al.\n2001a), although their effectiveness depends on many untested\nassumptions about the outflows, such as the geometry of the\nmagnetic field. Quasar winds are unlikely by themselves to\nentrain enough metals to account for the observed metallicities, although they can help to disperse the metals over large\nvolumes. Winds from star-forming galaxies are therefore the\nmost likely mechanism. Correlated supernovae in starbursts\ncan power \"superwinds\" with velocities \u223c 100\u20131000 km s\u22121\nthat reach far outside the host galaxy. Such winds have been\nstudied in many local starburst galaxies (Lehnert & Heckman\n1996; Martin 1999) as well as in Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs)\nat z \u223c 3 (Pettini et al. 2001, 2002; Shapley et al. 2002). Because\ntheir velocities exceed the escape speed from many of the hosts,\nwe expect a subset of these outflows to penetrate into the general IGM. Escape is most likely from dwarf galaxies, because\nthe amount of energy available to power a wind is proportional\nto the halo mass Mh while the gravitational potential confining\nthe wind increases with Mh2 . Thus, starburst winds can naturally\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is now obvious that mechanical feedback from galaxies and\nquasars has disturbed a significant fraction of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM). Types of feedback include relativistic quasar\njets, winds from quasars, and winds from star-forming galaxies. These mechanisms have had a variety of consequences,\nincluding IGM heating (e.g., Voit et al. 2002), the suppression\nof star formation in the host galaxy (e.g., Springel & Hernquist\n2002) and in nearby galaxies (e.g., Scannapieco, Thacker, &\nDavis 2001), and the generation of intergalactic magnetic fields\n(Kronberg, Lesch, & Hopp 1999; Furlanetto & Loeb 2001).\nPerhaps most importantly, feedback is responsible for enriching the IGM with heavy elements. Observations of the Ly\u03b1\nforest at z \u223c 3 show that absorption systems with column densities NHI & 1014.5 cm\u22122 (corresponding to overdensities \u03b4 & 5;\nSchaye 2001) have metallicities Z \u223c 10\u22123 \u201310\u22122 Z\u2299 (Tytler et\nal. 1995; Cowie et al. 1995; Songaila & Cowie 1996; Ellison\net al. 2000). Absorbers with NHI . 1014.5 cm\u22122 require stacking or pixel-by-pixel analysis because of the weakness of the\ncorresponding metal features, but recent studies suggest similar metallicities down to systems near the mean density of\nthe IGM (Cowie & Songaila 1998; Ellison et al. 1999, 2000;\nAguirre, Schaye, & Theuns 2002). These observations require\nthat & 5% of space be enriched with heavy elements by z \u223c 3\n(Madau, Ferrara, & Rees 2001). The era at which this pollution occurred is uncertain. Songaila (2001) found no evidence\nfor evolution in the total mass-weighted abundance of C IV and\nSi IV between z \u223c 1.5\u20135 (see also Qian et al. 2002). However,\nsuch mass-weighted measurements constrain only the metals in\nthe most massive systems and tell us little about the total volume of enriched space. Furthermore, conclusions about the total metallicity based on single ionization states are fraught with\nuncertainty.\nThe history of metal enrichment has several important consequences for structure formation. Most directly, its extent mea1\n2\n3\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden St., Cambridge, MA 02138\nInstitute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ 08540\nGuggenheim Fellow\n\n1\n\n\f2\naccount for a high-redshift episode of metal enrichment, when\nthe characteristic mass of galaxies is small.\nA great deal of theoretical work has gone into studying\nthe galactic wind pollution mechanism. Ideally, the enrichment process should be modeled with cosmological simulations. To this end, several numerical simulations have incorporated galactic winds (e.g., Scannapieco, Thacker, & Davis\n2001; Springel & Hernquist 2002; Theuns et al. 2002). Unfortunately, we do not yet fully understand the processes that\ngenerate winds even in nearby, well-observed starburst galaxies, although simulations are improving (Mac Low & Ferrara\n1999; Mori, Ferrara, & Madau 2002). We must therefore insert\nsimple parameterizations of the wind into the simulation. In\norder to understand the significance of this choice, most work\nto date has proceeded using analytic or semi-analytic methods\n(Nath & Trentham 1997; Ferrara, Pettini, & Shchekinov 2000;\nMadau, Ferrara, & Rees 2001; Scannapieco, Ferrara, & Madau\n2002). Such models have the advantage of allowing much more\nflexible parameter studies. Because the relevant parameters are\npoorly constrained at present, the IGM filling factor (i.e., the\nfraction of space filled by enriched material) estimated by these\nstudies varies widely (between \u223c 10\u22124 and \u223c 0.5). Aguirre\net al. (2001c) made a useful compromise between these two\napproaches by inserting winds into already completed cosmological simulations (see also Aguirre et al. 2001a,b). This allowed a broader parameter study than complete simulations and\nretained many of their advantages (such as the clustering of\nsources), while sacrificing a detailed treatment of the dynamical effects of the winds.\nThe crucial unknown parameters in galactic wind models fall\ninto three broad categories. First, the characteristic redshifts\nand masses of the wind hosts are critical for setting up simulations with finite resolution and box size. Second, the unknown\nstar formation efficiency at high redshifts has dramatic effects\non both the sizes of individual wind bubbles (because it determines the energy input into the winds) and on the total amount\nof metals produced. Finally, a variety of questions about the\nstructure of the winds remain unsettled. We do not know what\nfraction of the supernova energy is lost to radiation before entering the wind, what fraction of the galaxy mass is entrained\nby the wind, or the geometry of the winds. Studies of nearby\nstarbursts can help to answer these questions; however, winds\nat high redshifts may have dramatically different characteristics. For example, local superwinds are bipolar, with the wind\nflowing perpendicular to the galaxy disk. If star formation precedes disk formation in the halo, we would expect high-redshift\noutflows to be more isotropic (Madau, Ferrara, & Rees 2001).\nUltimately, we can only answer these questions through observations of the pollution mechanism. One promising technique is to study absorption lines caused by metals in the\nwinds. In both local starbursts (Phillips 1993; Lequeux et al.\n1995; Heckman & Leitherer 1997; Heckman et al. 2000) and\nLBGs (Pettini et al. 2001, 2002; Shapley et al. 2002) absorption features can be observed through moderate resolution spectroscopy of the host galaxy. Unfortunately, the hosts of highredshift (z & 6) starbursts will be too faint to serve as useful\nbackground lights. We therefore must use other bright background sources, such as quasars and GRBs, against which absorption can be seen. Such background sources have the distinct advantage of allowing us to probe \"relic\" winds whose\nhost galaxies no longer actively form stars. Relic wind bubbles\nare older and larger than the young winds in starburst galax-\n\nies; they are also more common than active winds because only\na fraction of galaxies host starbursts at any time. Thus relic\nbubbles fill more space than active winds, and a careful study\nof their properties is crucial. Similar observations have been\nattempted for local starbursts (Norman et al. 1996) and an extension of this technique has been used to study the effects of\nLBGs on the IGM (Adelberger et al. 2002). Oh (2002) has also\nproposed using metal absorption lines to study the reionization\nprocess, provided that metals have been injected relatively uniformly in dense regions by z \u223c 6.\nThe neutral fraction of IGM hydrogen is relatively large\n(& 1%) before the completion of reionization at zr & 6 (Becker\net al. 2001; Fan et al. 2002). The resulting absorption blueward\nof the Ly\u03b1 transition (Gunn & Peterson 1965) will render unobservable any metal lines with rest-frame wavelength \u03bbm in the\nrange (1 + zr )/(1 + z) < \u03bbm /\u03bbLy\u03b1 < 1, where \u03bbLy\u03b1 = 1216 \u00c5 and\nz is the redshift of the absorbing system. A transition below\nthe left-hand limit will be observable provided that it can be\nseparated from the Ly\u03b1 forest. A transition with \u03bbm > \u03bbLy\u03b1 is\nunaffected by neutral hydrogen inside a finite redshift interval\nzmin < z < zs , where zs is the redshift of the background source\nand\n\u03bbLy\u03b1\n1 + zmin = (1 + zs)\n.\n(1)\n\u03bbm\nWithin this range, metal absorption lines will remain visible. A\ncollection of sources with a range of zs should therefore allow\nus to probe winds throughout the high-z IGM.\nIn this paper, we use a simple semi-analytic model for winds\nfrom star-forming galaxies to study how observations of metal\nabsorption by wind bubbles in the era before reionization can\nconstrain the metal enrichment process. We compute the halo\nstar formation histories and follow the expansion of their winds\ninto the IGM. We show that metals carried by the winds produce\nobservable absorption features when seen against bright background sources, and that with current and future instruments,\nobservations of these lines can constrain the star formation efficiency in the early universe and can distinguish between different halo cooling scenarios and stellar initial mass functions.\nWe discuss our supernova wind model in \u00a72 and metals in\nthe high-redshift IGM in \u00a73. We present our predictions for\nthe statistics of metal absorbers in \u00a74 and discuss our results in\n\u00a75. We assume the standard \u039bCDM cosmological parameters\nof \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9b = 0.05, \u03c38 = 0.9, n = 1, and a Hubble constant H0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . We set h = 0.7 in our\nnumerical calculations.\n2. SUPERNOVA WIND MODEL\n\nIn this section we describe our model for superwinds in detail. We discuss the abundance of wind sources and their star\nformation histories in \u00a72.1. We fix the mechanical power driving the winds in \u00a72.2, and we describe our model for their expansion into the IGM in \u00a72.3.\n2.1. Halo Abundances and Star Formation Histories\nAt any redshift, the halo mass function dn/dM determines\nthe number of wind sources: each star-forming halo has the\npotential to drive such a wind. We use the Press & Schechter\n(1974) formalism to calculate the mass function, with the modifications suggested by Sheth & Tormen (1999) to better match\nnumerical simulations (Jenkins et al. 2001).\nA halo can only form stars if its mass exceeds a threshold\nMmin (z) = max[Mfil (z), Mcool (z)].\n(2)\n\n\fFurlanetto & Loeb\nThe first condition requires that the halo mass exceeds the \"filter mass\" Mfil , or the effective Jeans mass in the evolving IGM\n(Gnedin & Hui 1998). The second condition requires halo gas\nto cool efficiently after virialization. In the low metallicity halos we study, line transitions of atomic and molecular hydrogen\nare the only effective coolants. Atomic cooling is efficient in\nhalos with Tvir & 104 K, where the virial temperature Tvir is defined in equation (26) of Barkana & Loeb (2001). In most of\nour work, we will fix Mcool by requiring that atomic cooling can\nproceed. The vibrational lines of H2 make it an efficient coolant\nin halos with Tvir & 400 K. It is currently unknown when (and\neven whether) H2 is destroyed by photons below the ionization\nthreshold of atomic hydrogen (Haiman, Rees, & Loeb 1997;\nHaiman, Abel, & Rees 2000), or whether radiative feedback\nfrom early generations of stars enhances the formation of H2\n(Ricotti, Gnedin, & Shull 2002). We therefore also show results in which H2 cooling is permitted.\nThe power driving a wind is ultimately determined by the star\nformation history of the host halo, which is usually associated\nwith the halo merger history. We use a Monte Carlo implementation of the extended Press-Schechter formalism (Lacey\n& Cole 1993) to choose histories for each halo. Given a halo of\nmass Mh at redshift z f , this algorithm determines the probability distribution of progenitor masses (M1 , Mh \u2212 M1 ) that merged\nto form the object in a small redshift interval dz around z f (we\nchoose dz such that the probability of a major merger is < 1%).\nFor each halo, we construct the merger history by first choosing\nM1 from this distribution. We then choose the larger of the two\nprogenitor masses (i.e., M1 if M1 > Mh /2 and Mh \u2212 M1 otherwise) and repeat the process about a redshift z f + dz. We continue this procedure until the progenitor mass is smaller than\nMmin at a redshift zform .\nIn order to simplify our calculations, we divide the merger\nhistory into discrete events in which the halo mass has grown\nby > 50%. (We find that our results are insensitive to the value\nof this threshold.) We assume that in each such event a fraction\nf\u2217 of the accreted baryonic mass Mg is transformed into stars\non a timescale tsf . We assume that each merger occurs over the\nfree-fall time of the host halo tff , and we normally set tsf = tff . In\nthe rare occasions in which another merger event begins within\ntff of the first, we set tsf equal to the time between these events.\nIn fact, our results are relatively insensitive to tsf . Although\nthe wind dynamics do change during the \"active\" phase of the\nwind, most of the expansion occurs after active star formation\nhas ended as long as tsf \u226a H(z)\u22121 . If this condition is satisfied, the resulting bubble sizes do not depend strongly on tsf\nbecause bubbles spend most of their time in the late \"remnant\"\nstages. However, if tsf \u223c H(z)\u22121 , a significant amount of energy\nis lost to radiative cooling. In this case the total volume filled\nby metal-enriched winds can decrease by \u223c 25%.\nWith this prescription, we implicitly assume that a progenitor\ndoes not form stars and release mechanical energy until it joins\nthe \"trunk\" of the merger tree. In reality, as long as the progenitor mass exceeds Mmin (z), it would have formed stars before\nmerging and thus be surrounded by its own wind bubble. The\ntwo bubbles will presumably merge along with the galaxies in\nsome complicated manner. Our prescription is reasonable so\nlong as the total wind energy is approximately conserved during the merging process. Note also that by choosing to follow\nonly one of the progenitors at each branching, we do not necessarily track the largest single progenitor existing at each step.\nThis error is not important so long as our Monte Carlo prescrip-\n\n3\n\ntion includes a sufficiently large number of trials.\n2.2. Wind Luminosity\nOnce we have fixed the rate of star formation f\u2217 Mg /tsf , the\nmechanical luminosity in the wind depends only on the initial mass function (IMF) of the stars and the fraction of supernova energy available to power the wind. The IMF dependence can be characterized entirely by the total amount of\nstellar mass that must be formed in order to produce one supernova, \u03c9SN . For a Scalo (1998) IMF with lower and upper\nmass cutoffs Ml = 0.1 M\u2299 and Mu = 100 M\u2299 , \u03c9SN = 126 M\u2299 ,\nwhile for a Salpeter (1955) IMF with the same mass cutoffs,\n\u03c9SN = 135 M\u2299 . We use a Scalo IMF in the following because\nit better matches observations of the IMF in the local universe;\nhowever, the results are clearly insensitive to this choice.\nRecent simulations of the formation of metal-free stars indicate that these objects may be very different from nearby stars,\nwith typical masses \u223c 102 \u2013103 M\u2299 (Abel, Bryan, & Norman\n2002; Bromm, Coppi, & Larson 2002). This mass scale is determined by the physics of H2 cooling; we therefore assume\nthat when molecular hydrogen is an active coolant, star formation proceeds with a Very Massive Star (VMS) IMF. Unfortunately, these simulations do not yet have the dynamic range to\nfollow the collapse to nuclear burning, so they are unable to\npredict the final IMF or the allowed mass range of metal-free\nstars. We therefore assume (somewhat arbitrarily) that the IMF\nis a Salpeter-like power law with an index \u03b2 = 2.35 and mass\ncutoffs Ml = 100 M\u2299 and Mu = 500 M\u2299 . Interestingly, massive, low-metallicity stars leave very different remnants from\n\"normal\" stars (Heger & Woosley 2002). For a stellar mass\nless than 130 M\u2299 or greater than 260 M\u2299 , the star collapses\nto a black hole without significant matter or energy ejection.\nHowever, stars with masses 130 M\u2299 . M . 260 M\u2299 are subject to the e+ e\u2212 pair instability and explode without leaving a\nremnant black hole. Unlike normal supernovae, such explosions expel the highly-enriched core along with the envelope.\nThis mechanism may thus have significant consequences for\nmetal enrichment (see \u00a73.1 below). For our VMS IMF, we find\n\u03c9SN = 462 M\u2299 .\nWe assume that each supernova releases an energy ESN =\n1051 E51 erg into the interstellar medium of the host galaxy.\nFor a Scalo IMF, we assume E51 = 1. For a VMS IMF, we\nassume E51 = 10, an approximate logarithmic average of the\nmass-dependent explosion energy in the models of Heger &\nWoosley (2002). However, only a fraction fesc of this energy\nis available to power the wind: the rest is lost, primarily to radiative cooling, in the early stages of the outflow. Observations\nof the cool, dense ejecta of starbursts in the local universe require fesc & 0.1 (Heckman et al. 2000), while observations of\nthe warm and hot plasma in the wind imply fesc & 0.3 (Strickland et al. 2000). However, at high redshifts the characteristic\ndensity is much higher, and radiative cooling could in principle be more important. Simulations of high-redshift starbursts\nsuggest that fesc \u223c 0.25 (Mori, Ferrara, & Madau 2002).\nWith these parameters, the mechanical luminosity driving the\nwind is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf\u2217 fesc\n126 M\u2299 108 yr Mg\nLw = 1039\nerg s\u22121 .\nE51\n0.1 0.25\n\u03c9SN\ntsf 107 M\u2299\n(3)\n2.3. Wind Model\n\n\f4\nWe can now calculate the expansion of the wind into the\nIGM. The wind begins when the progenitor mass first exceeds\nMmin (z), and energy is added to it during each merger event.\nWe use the thin-shell approximation (Tegmark, Silk, & Evrard\n1993; Furlanetto & Loeb 2001), which is well-justified in a cosmological context (Ikeuchi, Tomisaka, & Ostriker 1983). The\nexpanding wind sweeps a fraction 1 \u2212 fm of the ambient IGM\ninto a thin shell. The remaining gas leaks into the hot, rarefied\ninterior whose pressure drives the shell expansion. Assuming\nspherical symmetry, we can then describe the outflow through\nthe following system of equations:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u03c0R2\nMs\nG\nR\u0308 =\n(p \u2212 pext) \u2212 2 Md + Mgal +\nMs\nR\n2\n\u0001\n\u1e40\ns\n+\u03a9\u039b (z)H 2 (z)R \u2212\n(4)\n\u1e58 \u2212 vinf ,\nMs\n\u1e58\nL\n\u2212 5p ,\n(5)\n\u1e57 =\n3\n2\u03c0R\nR\n\u001a\n0,\nvinf \u2265 \u1e58,\n\u1e40s =\n(6)\n4\u03c0R2 \u03c1g (\u1e58 \u2212 vinf ), vinf < \u1e58.\nHere, R is the shell radius in physical units, Ms is the shell\nmass, and p is the pressure of the hot bubble interior. The shell\nexpands through the host halo and into the IGM; the ambient\nbaryon density, infall velocity field, and external pressure are\ndenoted \u03c1g , vinf , and pext , respectively. We assume that the host\ngalaxy has photoionized the external medium, which is likely\nto be true during most of the wind's expansion. The enclosed\ndark matter mass is Md and the host galaxy mass (which can\nbe time dependent as the wind entrains material from the host)\nis Mgal . We use the universal halo profile of Navarro, Frenk,\n& White (1997) inside the accretion shock radius and the selfsimilar solution of Bertschinger (1985) outside of this radius,\nalthough the details of the profile are not critical to our results.\nEach halo is therefore embedded in a relatively small overdense\ninfall region, which is in turn surrounded by IGM at the mean\ncosmic density. Both Mh and the halo profile evolve as the host\ngalaxy grows through accretion. Finally, the rate of energy input L into the bubble interior is\nL = Lw \u0398(t \u2212 tsf ) + Ldiss \u2212 Lcomp ,\n(7)\nwhere Lcomp is the inverse Compton cooling luminosity, Lw is\nthe wind luminosity defined in equation (3), \u0398 is the Heaviside\nstep function, and\n1\nLdiss = \u2212 fd \u1e40(\u1e58 \u2212 vinf )2 .\n(8)\n2\nHere fd is the fraction of the energy dissipated by the acceleration of ambient material to the shell velocity that is retained by\nthe outflow (rather than lost through cooling inside the shell).\nIn the hot (T \u223c 106 K), rarefied bubble cavity, inverse Compton cooling dominates at the high redshifts we consider, with a\ncooling time\n\u00135/2\n\u0012\ntcomp\n10\n.\n(9)\n\u2248\n0.4\nH(z)\u22121\n1+z\nWe therefore neglect metal line and free-free cooling inside the\nbubble.4 Material in the shell will cool rapidly through either\n\ninverse Compton cooling (when it is ionized) or line cooling\n(once recombination occurs). We therefore set fd = 0, although\nwe also show some results for fd = 1. We describe the expansion model in more detail in Furlanetto & Loeb (2001).\nAs emphasized above, the structure of high-redshift winds\nis not well-constrained. They are likely to be more isotropic\nthan those of local starbursts because their disks are not as welldefined. LBGs appear to host isotropic outflows, because wind\nabsorption lines are seen in all LBGs that have been observed\n(Shapley et al. 2002). Moreover, the outflow will likely become more spherical as it plows into the IGM. We therefore\nassume that all winds expand spherically. A second key question is whether star formation occurs before or after the halo gas\ncollapses into a dense medium. In the former case, the wind expands into a spherical, relatively low density medium (see, e.g.,\nMadau, Ferrara, & Rees 2001). In this \"no disk formation\"\nmodel, we assume that supernovae inject energy into the center\nof the halo and that all of the halo gas is swept up by the shell.\nSimulations show that a substantial fraction (\u223c 0.5) of the gas\nin the halo may remain inside the protogalaxy (Mori, Ferrara, &\nMadau 2002); however, this choice makes only a small difference to our results because most of the expansion occurs after\nthe swept-up IGM mass exceeds the halo mass (see \u00a74.3).\nIn most of our work, we assume that the halo gas collapses to\na dense medium before the starburst begins, leaving the rest of\nthe halo empty of baryons. We assume that the dense medium\nhas a scale length\n\u03bb\nRd = \u221a Rvir ,\n(10)\n2\nwhere Rvir is the virial radius of the halo as defined in equation (24) of Barkana & Loeb (2001) and \u03bb = 0.05 is the spin\nparameter (Mo, Mao, & White 1998). With a slight abuse of\nterminology, we refer to this case as the \"disk formation\" scenario. Note that we do not require well-defined disks to form,\nonly that the gas has collapsed to a dense central object. We\nassume that the wind entrains a fraction fsw of the protogalactic material. Motivated by observations of local disk starbursts,\nwe set fsw = 2 f\u2217 in most of what follows (Martin 1999).5 The\ninitial velocity of the outflow vw is then fixed (c.f., Aguirre et\nal. 2001c; Springel & Hernquist 2002):\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nfesc\n2 126 M\u2299\nvw = 310\nkm s\u22121\n(11)\n0.25 fsw / f\u2217 \u03c9SN\nNote that vw is independent of halo mass, implying that winds\nwill most easily escape the gravitational attraction of smaller\nhalos. The wind velocities in nearby starbursts are inferred to\nbe independent of the host mass (Martin 1999).\nOur prescription for the initial conditions depends on\nwhether disk formation is allowed. If it is not, we use the selfsimilar wind-fed solution of Ostriker & McKee (1988) to calculate the time for the wind to travel to Rd assuming a constant\ndensity within this region. (Although Rd has no physical meaning in this case, we use it to fix numbers.) The self-similar solution also yields the initial velocity, and we assume that the remaining supernova energy goes into the bubble pressure. While\n\n4 Here we assume that the ejected metals are distributed in the same way as the shell and bubble gas, so that only a fraction f = 0.1 of the metals reside in the hot\nm\ninterior. Metal line cooling can then be safely ignored. If instead all the metals are confined to the hot cavity, metal line cooling cannot be ignored at z . 7 or when\nbubbles have cooled in the late stages of expansion (T . 105 K); in other situations, inverse Compton cooling still dominates. At low redshifts, we note also that\nheating by the ultraviolet background radiation field is significant.\n5 Note, however, that the inferred star formation rates in some high-z galaxies (e.g., Pettini et al. 2001) are much larger than those of low-z starbursts. The calibration\nof Martin (1999) may therefore not apply to these systems. Fortunately, our results are relatively insensitive to this choice (see Figure 11).\n\n\fFurlanetto & Loeb\nthis prescription makes several simplifying assumptions, the results are insensitive to the precise initial conditions in this case.\nIf disk formation is allowed, we assume that the wind travels\nwith a constant velocity vw within the dense collapsed region.\nThe initial time is determined by the time taken for the wind to\nreach Rd . For numerical stability, we convert half of the kinetic\nenergy to the thermal energy of the bubble interior before beginning the integration. (The final result is not sensitive to this\nconversion.)\nWhen gravity, density variations, external pressure, radiative cooling, and the cosmological expansion are ignored, our\nmodel for a single explosion recovers the usual Sedov-Taylor\nsolution if fd = 1 or the pressure-driven snowplow solution if\nfd = 0 (Ostriker & McKee 1988). With these effects included,\nwe find instead R \u221d E 0.35 at fixed halo mass, a somewhat steeper\nenergy dependence than expected in self-similar solutions. This\nis principally due to the deceleration of the Hubble flow: an explosion with smaller energy takes longer to escape the host halo\nand therefore must expend more energy accelerating the sweptup IGM. Our model matches well with previous analytic work\non outflows (e.g., Barkana & Loeb 2001). However, it predicts\nwind radii approximately twice those found by Madau, Ferrara,\n& Rees (2001), even when we include only the effects that are\npart of their model. We do not consider this a cause for concern,\nbecause the simulations of Mori, Ferrara, & Madau (2002) have\na similar discrepancy and compare favorably with our results.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the physical sizes R and expansion velocities vexp of supernova wind bubbles at z = 20, 12, 8, and 3\nas a function of host halo mass. We assume the following parameters: f\u2217 = 0.1, fesc = 0.25, \u03c9SN = 126 M\u2299 (corresponding\nto a Scalo IMF), atomic cooling, disk formation, and fd = 0.\nThe lower mass limit in each panel is simply Mmin , and the upper limit is the approximate mass Mmax above which the winds\ncannot escape the host halo. At a given mass, the dispersion\nin radius and velocity is caused by the randomly chosen star\nformation histories. For halos near Mmin , R varies significantly\nbecause such halos have undergone only a few star formation\nepisodes. Thus, the time elapsed since the wind began fluctuates strongly. As Mh increases, the number of mergers increases\nand the dispersion decreases. Recall that the wind begins when\nthe progenitor crosses the cooling threshold, and each subsequent merger adds energy to it. Because massive halos have\nundergone many such random merger events, the fluctuations\nin merger times average out and the scatter in R is fairly small.\nThe dispersion increases again near Mmax , where the star formation history, detailed wind model, and initial conditions all have\na substantial effect on whether the wind can escape beyond Rvir .\nFortunately, halos near Mmax are sufficiently rare that they have\nnegligible effects on our final results.\nR increases rapidly as redshift decreases because of the increasing cosmic time available to the outflow. The dispersion\nalso increases with redshift, because small variations in the formation time make larger differences when the total lifetime of\nthe outflow is small. The weak dependence of radius on mass\nis primarily due to the gravitational binding of the host. Because the energy available to the starburst scales with Mh while\nthe gravitational potential scales with Mh2 , we expect R(Mh )\nto flatten as mass increases until eventually the winds can no\nlonger escape outside the virial radii of the hosts (shown by\nthe solid curves). For most of the redshift range of interest\nand for reasonable choices of parameters, the threshold halo\nmass is Mmax \u223c 1010 \u20133\u00d71011 M\u2299 , increasing as z decreases be-\n\n5\n\ncause halos become less concentrated. Well below this thresh\u223c1/5\nold mass, we find R \u221d Mh , as would have been expected in\na naive Sedov-Taylor solution (though the agreement is coincidental and the scaling only approximate). The top left panel\nof Figure 1 shows that LBGs can directly affect the surrounding IGM to (physical) distances \u223c 100 kpc, provided that they\nreside in halos with Mh \u223c 1011 M\u2299 (see also Aguirre et al.\n2001b). Interestingly, Adelberger et al. (2002) find that regions\nwithin \u223c 125 kpc of LBGs have unexpectedly small amounts\nof H I. One possible explanation is that winds have cleared this\nregion of H I; if so, these observations suggest that our model\nprovides a reasonable description of the extent of outflows.\n\nF IG . 1.- Physical radius R of wind bubbles at various redshifts, as a function of halo mass. The solid line in each panel shows the virial radius Rvir of\nthe host halo. Note that both the mass and radius scales change between the\ndifferent panels. All panels assume our standard set of parameters.\n\nFigure 2 shows that all of our wind bubbles have characteristic expansion velocities vexp \u223c 50 km s\u22121 , with a substantial dispersion. The velocity increases slowly with mass, particularly\nat low redshifts, until Mh \u223c Mmax . Our expansion velocities are\nmuch smaller than those inferred from observed starburst winds\n(Heckman et al. 2000; Pettini et al. 2002). The difference is,\nhowever, easily understood. While existing observations probe\nthe early stages of starburst winds, our models primarily sample\nthe late time behavior. At early times, the material ejected from\nthe host galaxy dominates the dynamics, but gravity and collisions with the ambient IGM inevitably decelerate the winds\nlater on. We can estimate vexp by assuming that the host experiences one major merger per Hubble time and that all of the\nenergy released goes into accelerating the swept-up medium.\nThe average expansion velocity is then\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\nf\u2217 fesc 126 M\u2299 Mh\n\u22121\nvexp \u223c 50 km s\n0.1 0.25 \u03c9SN 109 M\u2299\n\u00132/3 \u0012\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n10\n20 kpc\n.\n(12)\n\u00d7\nR\n1+z\nThis simple estimate neglects cooling, gravity, and the Hubble\nflow energy contained in the IGM, but it illustrates the approx1/5\nimate velocities we find in our model.

Note that the Mach number M \u2261 vexp /cs \u223c 4,\nwhere cs is the sound speed of the photo-ionized IGM. The thin\nshell model assumes M \u226b 1, so it is only marginally valid in\nthis regime. The detailed expansion may therefore differ somewhat from our model.\n\nF IG . 2.- Expansion velocity vexp of wind bubbles at various redshifts, as a\nfunction of halo mass. Note that the mass scale changes between the different\npanels. All panels assume our standard set of parameters.\n\n3. METAL LINES AT HIGH - REDSHIFT\n\nWe now calculate the distribution of metals within the wind\nbubbles, including the most abundant elements and ionization\nstates as well as the geometry of the metal-polluted regions.\n3.1. Metal Yields\nThe relevant elements are easy to determine: they are those\natoms most abundantly produced by Type II supernovae (for a\nScalo IMF) or by pair instability supernovae (for a VMS IMF).\nWe summarize the average yields per supernova Yx for these elements in Table 1. For Type II supernovae, we use the yields\nof Woosley & Weaver (1995) averaged over a Scalo IMF with\nZ = 10\u22124 Z\u2299 . These yields depend on the energy of the supernova, which introduce uncertainties of \u223c 25%. We have conservatively taken the yields from the lower energy model. The\nmetallicity of the progenitor star introduces a similar uncertainty, but we do not include chemical evolution within galaxies\nbecause other simplifications in our model create uncertainties\nat least as large. For the VMS scenario, we average the yields\nof Heger & Woosley (2002) over our power-law IMF.\nTable 1 also lists the properties of several interesting transitions, including the wavelength \u03bbm and the oscillator strength\nfosc . We will focus on these lines in the following.\n3.2. Wind Structure\nNext we must determine how the ions are distributed\nthroughout the wind. Note that we assume purely spherical\nexpansion throughout. In reality, each halo is surrounded by\nthe \"cosmic web\" of filaments and voids. Dense filaments will\nslow the shell and break spherical symmetry. Fortunately, they\nfill only a small fraction of space and will not strongly affect the\n\ntotal volume of the bubble (e.g., Theuns et al. 2002). A more\nserious problem is fragmentation (see below).\nObservations of both local starburst winds (Heckman et al.\n2000) and LBG outflows (Pettini et al. 2002) show very complex ionization structure, with absorption from both low ionization states typical of H I regions (such as C II, O I, Si II,\nand Fe II) and high-ionization states (such as C IV and Si IV).\nWithin the wind region, the hot gas is inferred to have a very\nhigh covering fraction CA (defined as the fraction of the crosssectional area covered by the gas), while the low-ionization\ngas has CA \u223c 0.4\u20130.8 depending on the source (Heckman et\nal. 2000; Shapley et al. 2002).\nIf mixing between the ejected gas and the swept-up IGM is\nefficient, the thin-shell model requires that a fraction 1 \u2212 fm of\nthe metals reside in a cool, dense shell with T \u223c 104 K, with\nthe remainder in the hot, rarefied interior. Although there is\ngood evidence for a shell structure in many observations of\nstarburst winds (Martin 1998; Cecil et al. 2001), other observations suggest that the cool gas resides in clouds entrained by\nthe wind (Heckman et al. 2000). Even though there is often\nlittle evidence for a cool shell in starbursts of the latter type,\nthe related observations exclusively study young starbursts in\nwhich the wind mass is still dominated by gas ejected from\nthe host galaxy. Once the swept-up IGM gas dominates the\nwind, a shell will inevitably form (thought it may not be spherical). It is not clear whether the metals will fully mix with the\nswept-up material that constitutes most of the shell mass. However, in our model the shell itself travels with vexp \u223c 50 km s\u22121\nwhile winds are launched with vw \u223c 300 km s\u22121 (see equation [11]). For M \u226a Mmax , entrainment of the ambient IGM\ncauses most of the deceleration; therefore metals in the wind\nwill not decelerate significantly until they impact the shell at\nt \u223c 5 \u00d7 106(R/kpc) yr, where mixing through turbulence or diffusion can occur.\nHowever, the shell may eventually fragment into clouds due\nto cooling, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, turbulence, or inhomogeneities in the ambient medium. Fragmentation is particularly likely given the relatively modest Mach number of the\nflow (see \u00a72.3). At z = 3, an analysis similar to our own shows\nthat galactic winds must fragment in order not to overproduce\nLy\u03b1 absorption lines (Theuns, Mo, & Schaye 2001). If either the shell has fragmented or the metals are distributed in\ncold clouds throughout the bubble, only a fraction CA < 1 of\nall lines of sight through the wind bubble will produce metal\nabsorption lines. On the other hand, each line of sight that\ndoes pass through a cloud will have on average a larger column\ndensity of metals. For unsaturated lines, the equivalent width\nW \u221d Nx \u221d CA\u22121 , where Nx is the column density of the relevant\nion. In this regime (which is satisfied for most of the lines of\ninterest; see \u00a74.1), we then have the transformation\ndN(> W )\ndN(> CAW )\n\u2192 CA\n,\n(13)\ndz\ndz\nwhere dN(> W )/dz is the number of absorption systems intersected per unit redshift with equivalent width greater than W\nalong a random line of sight (see \u00a74.3). For saturated lines,\nthe equivalent width transformation factor will be smaller. Because our results can be scaled relatively easily with CA , for\nconcreteness we assume that CA = 1. We further discuss the\nconsequences of fragmentation in \u00a75.\nThe wind structure will also determine the width of the metal\nlines. In the shell (with T \u223c 104 K), the thermal line widths are\nbth \u223c 3.7(12/Ax)1/2 km s\u22121 , where b is the Doppler parameter\n\n\fFurlanetto & Loeb\nand Ax is the atomic mass of the ion x. In this case, though\nthe lines may be very deep, they will be extremely narrow and\nhence difficult to detect except with extremely high-resolution\ninfrared spectroscopy. However, low and moderate resolution\nspectroscopy of both nearby starbursts and LBG outflows show\nline widths comparable to or greater than the inferred mean expansion velocity of the wind (Heckman et al. 2000; Pettini et al.\n2002). This can be easily understood if cloud fragments, each\nwith an intrinsic line width bth , are distributed throughout the\nwind with a velocity dispersion comparable to vexp , or if clouds\nare continuously produced and accelerated by the wind. We\nassume in the following that b = vexp . Note that the expansion\nvelocities we find (b \u223c 50 km s\u22121 ; see \u00a72.3) are much smaller\nthan those typically observed in young starburst winds. If star\nformation is ongoing, and if the fast wind near the host contains\na substantial fraction of the metals, we will underestimate the\ntrue line width. However, as long as the lines are not saturated,\nthe equivalent width W is independent of our choice for b. Even\nif the lines are saturated, we cannot overestimate W so long as\nwe underestimate the velocity dispersion. We emphasize again\nthat the observations from which we calibrate b = vexp use the\nstarburst galaxy itself as the background light source; thus, they\nonly constrain the active phases of the starburst. The old winds\nthat we study through background quasar spectra may have very\ndifferent velocity dispersions.\n3.3. Ionization States\nGiven the most abundant elements, we now determine the\nrelevant ionization states. Three ionizing processes must be included: collisional ionization (especially in the hot interior),\nphotoionization from the host galaxy, and photoionization by\nthe extragalactic background light. In general, if a fraction Cm\nof a given element is in a specified ionization state, the covering\nfraction of the outflow is unaffected but Nx \u221d Cm . Thus in the\nunsaturated line limit\ndN(> W )\ndN(> Cm\u22121W )\n\u2192\n.\n(14)\ndz\ndz\nCm < 1 can also occur if metals are retained by the host galaxy.\nHowever, simulations suggest that the wind carries a very large\nfraction of the metals produced during a starburst (Mac Low &\nFerrara 1999).\nIn the thin shell model, we can estimate the ionization state\nof the metals in each phase. We first consider metals in the\nshell. If the hydrogen in the shell is neutral, metals will reside\nin states typical of H I regions (C II, O I, Si II, and Fe II for\nthe elements of interest), because photons able to further ionize\nthese elements will be absorbed by H I. The ionization potential of O I is 13.62 eV, and it remains locked in charge exchange\nequilibrium with H I (see Oh 2002 for a discussion of the utility of this mechanism). The other elements have first ionization\npotentials below that of hydrogen. We now show that the extragalactic background light most likely suffices to maintain these\nfirst ionized states. The total column density of a metal x along\na typical line of sight through (each side of) the wind is\nNx,tot \u2248\n\nYx \u03a9b\nf\u2217 Mh\n.\n\u03c9SN \u03a90 4\u03c0Ax m p R2\n\n(15)\n\nWe can estimate the background flux J(\u03bdion ) \u2261 Jion , where \u03bdion is\nthe ionization threshold of the relevant species, needed to keep\na metal ionized by requiring that the ionization rate exceed the\nrecombination rate within the shell: Jion & \u03b1x ne Nx,tot , where \u03b1x\n\n7\n\nis the recombination coefficient and ne is the electron density in\nthe shell.

The electron density is difficult\nto constrain. The standard jump conditions for an isothermal\nshock give a shell baryon density nsh \u223c M2 \u2206n\u0304b , where \u2206 is the\nlocal overdensity through which the shell travels. However, the\nshell initially plows through highly overdense material within\nthe halo (\u2206 & 200) at a very high velocity. Later, the shell\nthickness can only increase at the sound speed and it may not\nhave had sufficient time to expand to its equilibrium structure.\nWe now estimate the extragalactic background over the range\n\u223c 7\u201313 eV, which includes photons able to ionize C, Si, and Fe.\nWe assume that the emissivity of a typical galaxy obeys \u03b5 \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1\nand is proportional to the mass of the galaxy. The volume emissivity of photons is then\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03bd\ndz dFcoll\n0\nj(\u03bd, z) = 2\u03c0\u03b1h\u0304Nion f\u2217 nH\n,\n(17)\n\u03bdH\ndt\ndz\nwhere Fcoll is the fraction of collapsed baryons in galaxies and\nwhere we have normalized the emission spectrum to the number of photons per baryon in stars emitted above the ionization\nthreshold of hydrogen \u03bdH , Nion \u223c 4000 (Barkana & Loeb 2001).\nThe extragalactic background is (Haiman, Rees, & Loeb 1997)\nZ\n\u2032\n1\nj(\u03bdz , z\u2032 )e\u2212\u03c4 (z ) dl(z\u2032 ),\n(18)\nJ\u03bd (z) =\n4\u03c0\nwhere \u03bdz = \u03bd[(1+z\u2032 )/(1+z)], \u03c4 (z\u2032 ) is the IGM optical depth at \u03bdz ,\nand l is the proper length. Below \u03bdH , the only sources of significant opacity are the Lyman lines of hydrogen. For a given observed frequency \u03bd at z, the universe is thus optically thin back\nto the point zon at which this radiation would have blueshifted\ninto the nearest Lyman line (denoted here as Lyx),\n\u03bdLyx\n1 + zon =\n(1 + z).\n(19)\n\u03bd\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22121 \u22121\nThus (in units of erg s cm Hz sr )\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u2212\u03b1\n\u0012\n\u03bdion\nf\u2217 Nion \u03a9b h2\nJion (z) = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221221\u03b1\n0.1 4000 0.0245\n\u03bdH\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b1\nZ zon\n1+z\ndFcoll\ndz\u2032\n\u00d7\n.\n(20)\n\u2032\n1\n+\nz\ndz\nz\nFor carbon, the integral is typically (\u223c 10\u22125 , 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 , 2 \u00d7\n10\u22123 , 10\u22122 ) for z = 20, 16, 12, and 8, with weak dependence on\nthe spectral slope. The background for Fe and Si is a few times\nlarger. Comparing equations (16) and (20), we see that so long\nas the shell is neutral (ne \u226a nsh ) or the shell is not extraordinarily overdense, the extragalactic background will easily ionize\nthese elements to C II, Si II, and Fe II.\nBy definition, the extragalactic background cannot ionize hydrogen in the shell until after cosmological reionization. We\nnow consider whether the host galaxy can ionize the shell.\nAccording to the starburst models of Leitherer et al. (1999),\nthe number of ionizing photons produced per unit time by an\ninstantaneous starburst with a Salpeter IMF and metallicity\nZ = 0.05Z\u2299 (the lowest metallicity they calculated) a time t after\nthe burst is\n\u0013\u22124 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndN\u03b3\nf\u2217 Mg\nt\ns\u22121\n(21)\n\u223c 1051.1\ndt\n107 yr\n106 M\u2299\n\n\f8\nprovided that t & 107 yr. Here f\u2217 Mg is the stellar mass produced\nin the starburst. Of these, only a fraction \u03c7 can escape the host\ngalaxy. This escape fraction is poorly constrained at present\nbut is likely . 10% (Leitherer et al. 1995; Wood & Loeb 2000;\nDove, Shull, & Ferrara 2000; Steidel, Pettini, & Adelberger\n2001).\nAs above, we can calculate the column depth of ionized hydrogen NHII by balancing the number of ionizations and recombinations per second. The recombination rate again depends on\nthe shell density. NHII will be largest for the smallest nsh ; we\ntherefore assume pessimistically that nsh \u223c M2 n\u0304b . We compare NHII to the total column in the shell Nsh , assuming that the\nswept up matter dominates the shell mass. We then find, for an\ninstantaneous starburst, that\n\u00133 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nNHII\nMh\n10\n20 kpc\nf\u2217 \u03c7\n\u22123\n\u223c 10\nNsh\n0.1 0.1 108 M\u2299\nR\nM2\n\u0012 8 \u0013\u22124 \u0012\n\u00136 \u0012\n\u00134\n\u0013\u0012\n10 yr\n10\n0.05 0.3\n0.7\n\u00d7\n(22)\nt\n1+z\n\u03a9b \u03a90\nh\nWe have confirmed the approximate validity of this simple\nestimate over the range of densities and spectra of interest\nwith CLOUDY (Ferland 2001). Thus, once an appreciable\ntime has elapsed after the starburst, the shells remain neutral. However, if active star formation persists, dN\u03b3 /dt \u223c\n1053.2 (\u1e40\u2217 / M\u2299 yr) s\u22121 (Leitherer et al. 1999). The shell could\nthen in principle remain partially ionized for a longer period. If\nthe shells fragment or if the metals otherwise reside in clouds,\nthe densities will increase beyond M2 n\u0304H , making ionization\neven more difficult. In this case, the ionization balance would\nalso depend on the size of the clouds, parameterized in our\nmodel by CA .\nObservations of nearby starburst winds and LBG outflows\nfind strong absorption from low ionization states (Heckman et\nal. 2000; Pettini et al. 2002). In all of these systems, the starburst is still active and hence dN\u03b3 /dt is large. In the old winds\nthat provide most of the absorption lines, the arguments above\nshow that low ionization states should be even more important.\nIn the following we therefore focus on low ionization states,\nand we assume that Cm = 1. While this is obviously a naive\napproximation, our results can easily be rescaled by equation\n(14). For completeness, we also show some results for ions appropriate to a \"warm\" medium, C IV and Si IV. These ions may\nbe appropriate if metals are advected to the shell but do not mix\nefficiently with the swept-up IGM, thus remaining at the interface between the cool shell and the hot cavity. Lines from these\nions are prominent in LBG winds (Pettini et al. 2002; Shapley\net al. 2002).\nIf, however, the metals remain locked in the hot bubble cavity, our assumptions will break down. This medium has density\n\u223c fm n\u0304H and is easily ionized by even trace amounts of star formation in the host. More importantly, the gas in this phase has\ntypical temperatures T \u223c 105.5 \u2013106.5 K and thus is collisionally ionized to very high ionization states that lack rest-frame\noptical or ultraviolet absorption lines. Fortunately, any metals\ncarried by the hot wind medium will eventually be advected to\nthe shell, where cooling and mixing will occur (see \u00a73.2).\n4. RESULTS\n\nWith the wind model described in \u00a72 and the metal characteristics outlined in \u00a73, we can now calculate the consequences\nof metal pollution from galactic winds. We list the parameters\n\nof our model, along with their standard choices, in Table 2. Unless otherwise specified, all curves shown assume these values.\nWe also consider two halo cooling channels: atomic hydrogen\ncooling, which allows halos with Tvir & 104 K to form stars,\nand molecular hydrogen cooling, which reduces the threshold\nto Tvir & 400 K. In the former case, we assume a Scalo (1998)\nIMF applies, while in the latter we assume a VMS IMF. This\nchoice in turn determines \u03c9SN , E51 , and Yx . For H2 cooling, we\nset \u03c9SN = 462 M\u2299 and E51 = 10.\nWe present the results of our model in the following sections.\nFirst we describe the observable characteristics of individual\nwinds in \u00a74.1. We then discuss the global evolution of the metal\nfilling factor in \u00a74.2. Finally, we present our predictions for absorption line statistics in \u00a74.3.\n\nF IG . 3.- Central optical depth \u03c40 of the O I \u03bb1302 feature as a function\nof halo mass Mh for our standard parameter choices. Crosses, horizontal lines,\ntriangles, and points refer to z = 20, 16, 12, and 8, respectively.\n\n4.1. Wind Characteristics\nAbsorption lines are characterized by three basic parameters\n(of which two are independent): the line width b, the central\noptical depth \u03c40 , and the equivalent width W . In our model, we\nset b = vexp (see Figure 2). Although we present our results exclusively in terms of W , it is also useful to examine the central\noptical depth \u03c40 of the absorption systems. In a real observation, \u03c40 helps to determine the ease with which each line can\nbe identified. It also indicates where saturation becomes important (and hence where equations [13] and [14] break down).\nThe typical column density of an ion x through (each side of)\nthe wind per velocity interval is\nNx,tot 2 2\nNx (u) = \u221a e\u2212u /b ,\n(23)\n\u03c0b\nwhere u is the velocity relative to vexp .

At a given z, the minimum \u03c40 is determined by the\nsmallest halos that can collapse to form stars (fixed in this case\nby the atomic cooling threshold).\n\n9\n\n(Kauffmann et al. 2002; Dekel & Woo 2002).

Typical equivalent widths increase from \u223c 0.5\u2013\n10 \u00c5 between z = 8 and z = 20. W increases with redshift both\nbecause of stretching by the cosmological redshift and because\nthe wind bubbles are smaller at these times. When line satura3/5\ntion can be neglected, W \u221d b\u03c40 \u221d Mh . As the lines become\nsaturated, the relationship flattens. Interestingly, Figure 4 suggests that a line of a given equivalent width can be associated\nwith a halo in a fairly narrow mass range, particularly at lower\nredshifts. This is essentially a consequence of the relatively\nsmall dispersion in wind bubble sizes for a fixed set of parameters and our assumption that f\u2217 and fesc do not vary systematically with halo mass. As a result, Nx is well-determined given\n2/3\nthe halo mass. There are some recent indications that f\u2217 \u221d Mh\n6\n\nTo calculate the filling factor of the wind bubbles, we compute\nZ \u221e\ndn\nV (M, z),\n(27)\nQ(z) =\ndM\ndM\nMmin (z)\nwhere V (M, z) is the comoving volume of the wind produced\nby a halo of mass M at a redshift z and dn/dM is the halo mass\nfunction (Press & Schechter 1974; Sheth & Tormen 1999).\nNote that we do not include photoheating due to reionization\nin determining Mmin . We therefore likely overestimate Q(z) for\nz < 6, but we include these results for comparison with previous\nwork. Because the star formation history determines the wind\nsize, we perform the integral using a Monte Carlo algorithm.\nWe chose the mass sampling by requiring that our results converge to . 10% between trials.6 Because winds escape small\nhalos most easily, Q(z) is dominated by winds from low-mass\nhalos (in most of our calculations, winds with Mh . 10Mmin (z)\naccount for \u223c 75% of the total polluted volume); in practice, the\nintegral need only extend to some maximum mass Mmax (see\n\u00a72.2). The principal shortcoming of this model is that it neglects the overlap of wind bubbles; thus, we can have Q(z) > 1.\nIf sources are randomly distributed, the true filling factor will be\n\u03a6 = 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212Q(z)]. However, the relationship between Q(z) and\nthe true filling factor cannot be so easily quantified if sources\nare clustered (see \u00a75).\nFigures 5 and 6 show Q(z) in our model. In Figure 5, we\ncompare Q(z) for H2 cooling (solid curves) and atomic cooling\n(dotted curves). Within each set, the three curves correspond to\nf\u2217 = 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5, from bottom to top. All other parameters\nhave their standard values. We see that, in the atomic cooling\n\nFor f\u2217 fesc . 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 , stochastic fluctuations are large and the convergence is somewhat worse; see Figure 5 for an example.\n\n\f10\nscenario, Q(z = 12) \u2248 1% and Q(z = 6) \u2248 10% (for f\u2217 = 0.1).\nThe filling factor increases rapidly with cosmic time because\nof the increasing fraction of baryons in collapsed objects and\nbecause the winds have considerably more time to expand at\nlow redshifts, a point emphasized by Aguirre et al. (2001c). By\nallowing less massive halos to form stars and by injecting an\norder of magnitude more energy per supernova, the H2 cooling scenario leads to a much larger filling factor: with f\u2217 = 0.1,\nthis model has Q(z = 12) \u2248 1. The dashed line (nearly obscured\nby the lowest solid line) shows the H2 cooling scenario with\nf\u2217 = 0.1 and E51 = 1; thus, even if H2 cooling creates \"normal\"\nmassive stars the enrichment process is still much more efficient than with pure atomic cooling. At very high redshifts,\nthe minimum halo mass in the atomic cooling scenario is above\nthe nonlinear mass scale in the Sheth & Tormen (1999) mass\nfunction. In this regime, the halo abundance is exponentially\nsuppressed; therefore, Q(z) for H2 cooling greatly exceeds that\nfor atomic cooling. The gap closes (though it is still substantial) as Mmin falls below the nonlinear mass scale at lower redshifts. Our results for Q(z) in the atomic cooling scenario are\nvery similar to those of Scannapieco, Ferrara, & Madau (2002),\neven though they use a more sophisticated algorithm to determine star formation efficiencies and halo clustering. We find\nsignificant differences, however, between their \"Population III\"\nscenario and our H2 cooling scenario. The disparity is likely\ncaused by their requirement that H2 cooling occurs before disk\nformation which imposes a much more stringent mass threshold than ours, and because we assume that VMS supernovae are\nmore energetic.\n\nF IG . 6.- Filling factor of enriched regions as a function of redshift normalized to f\u2217 fesc , Q(z)/( f\u2217 fesc ). The three solid curves show fesc = 1, 0.25, and\n0.1 with f\u2217 = 0.1. The dashed and dotted curves assume f\u2217 = 0.5 and f\u2217 = 0.01,\nrespectively, with fesc = 0.25. All other parameters take their standard values.\n\nFigure 6 plots Q(z)/( f\u2217 fesc ) for the atomic cooling scenario.\nWe have thus normalized Q(z) by the factor controlling the energy output in the outflows. This normalized filling factor is\nconstant (to within a factor \u223c 2) at a fixed redshift as long as\nf\u2217 fesc & 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 (c.f., Scannapieco, Ferrara, & Madau 2002).\nAs discussed in \u00a72.2, our model yields R \u221d E 0.35 at a fixed mass\nMh \u226a Mmax . Thus, Q(z)/( f\u2217 fesc ) should be nearly constant so\nlong as the halos that contribute most to the filling factor (i.e.,\n\nthe first decade in mass above Mmin ) are well below this mass\nthreshold for efficient escape. The proportionality is broken for\nf\u2217 fesc . 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 because the number of halos hosting substantial winds begins to depend on f\u2217 fesc .\n4.3. Line Statistics\nUnfortunately, the volume filling factor Q(z) is difficult to\nobserve, requiring sophisticated pixel-by-pixel analyses (e.g.,\nAguirre, Schaye, & Theuns 2002). It is therefore more useful\nto consider the statistics of absorption lines. The number of systems intersected per redshift interval with an observed equivalent width W greater than some threshold W0 along a random\nline of sight is\nZ\ndN(> W0 ) dr \u221e\ndn\n=\nA(M, z)\u0398(W \u2212 W0 ),\n(28)\ndM\ndz\ndz Mmin (z)\ndM\nwhere A(M, z) is the comoving cross-sectional area of the wind,\ndr/dz is the comoving distance per unit redshift, and \u0398(W \u2212W0 )\nis unity if the equivalent width of a typical line of sight through\nthe wind is greater than W0 and zero otherwise. Again, our\nmodel neglects halo clustering (see \u00a75 for a discussion of its effects). We could in principle choose random impact parameters\nfor each bubble; however, given the approximations we have\nalready made, we consider this extra layer of complexity to be\nunnecessary. Note that equation (28) assumes a single absorption line per halo. In the ideal case, each intersected wind bubble would cause 2 lines separated by \u223c 2vexp . However, if the\nvelocity resolution of the observation is lower than this value,\nthe two lines would appear as a single feature, albeit with an\nequivalent width up to twice that which we assume. The two\nlines will also merge if b > vexp . For clarity, we therefore assume that only one line is produced per halo.\nAnother important quantity is a measure of the total flux\nper redshift interval absorbed by a single transition (neglecting\noverlap of the lines),\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nd dN(> W )\nWtot = W\ndW.\n(29)\ndW\ndz\nIf Wtot \u226a \u03bbm , lines will be isolated and easily separated. If\nWtot \u223c \u03bbm , lines blend together and absorb a large fraction of\nthe flux from the background source.\nFigure 7 shows the evolution of dN(> W )/dz with redshift.\nHere we show results for O I \u03bb1302, the strongest line in the\natomic cooling scenario. The curves show line statistics at\nz = 20 (dotted line), z = 16 (short-dashed line), z = 12 (longdashed line), and z = 8 (solid line). Each assumes our standard parameter set. Clearly, the number of lines intersected depends strongly on redshift, particularly for weak lines (increasing from \u223c 0.25 to \u223c 40 with W > 0.5 \u00c5 per redshift interval\nfrom z = 20 to z = 8). Two factors contribute to this increase: the\nwinds are more compact at higher redshifts (see Figure 1) and\nthe fraction of baryons in star-forming galaxies is much smaller\nat higher redshifts. The shape of the curves are easy to understand. As shown in Figure 4, a given W roughly corresponds\nto halos of a particular mass at fixed z. Thus, at each redshift,\ndN(> W )/dz is a measure of the (cumulative) halo mass function weighted by R2 . The \"saturation\" at small W is simply a\nresult of the minimum halo mass for star formation Mmin . Figure 7 also shows how Wtot evolves with redshift. Recalling that\nO I is the strongest line we consider, line blanketing should not\nbe significant for f\u2217 = 0.1 in the atomic cooling scenario.\n\n\fFurlanetto & Loeb\n\n11\n\nincreasing mass function at small masses, which allows many\nmore individual halos to produce winds if H2 cooling is permitted; the line statistics are more sensitive to the number of starforming halos than is Q(z) because they depend most strongly\non the total number of individual winds that can in principle be\nintersected. However, because the additional halos are small,\nthey generally produce weak lines. Therefore the enhancement\nof weak lines is much larger than the enhancement of strong\nlines (this being particularly evident at z = 12). Interestingly,\nWtot is very large for all redshifts in the H2 cooling scenario.\nThus a large fraction of the background source flux could be\nabsorbed by overlapping metal lines in this scenario, extending\nthe apparent Gunn-Peterson absorption to much higher wavelengths than otherwise expected.\n\nF IG . 7.- Number of intersections per redshift interval above a given equivalent width threshold for O I \u03bb1302. From top to bottom, curves refer to\nz = 8, 12, 16, and 20. All parameters take their standard values. We also list\nWtot (see equation [29]) for each line.\n\nFigure 8 shows the O I statistics for the atomic cooling scenario at z = 8. From top to bottom, the three solid curves assume f\u2217 = 0.5, 0.1, and 0.01, with fesc = 0.25. The two dashed\ncurves assume fesc = 1 and 0.1 (top and bottom at the left, respectively), with f\u2217 = 0.1. All other parameters are standard.\nRecall that Q(z) \u221d f\u2217 fesc ; clearly, the dependence of the line\nstatistics on these parameters is not degenerate. Essentially,\nabsorption lines give information about both the extent of the\nenriched IGM and the level of enrichment. Recall that fesc affects only the amount of energy powering the wind, while f\u2217\naffects both the energy input into the wind and the total mass of\nmetals produced. Thus, an increase in fesc increases the number of weak lines but decreases the number of strong lines, because the metals become more dilute. An enhanced star formation efficiency increases the number of lines of all strengths.\nThe total absorption Wtot strikingly reveals the difference. As\nshown in Figure 8, Wtot increases rapidly with f\u2217 . However, it\nvaries only slowly with fesc , increasing from 41 \u00c5 to 57 \u00c5 between fesc = 0.1 and fesc = 1. Note that if f\u2217 is very high at\nthis redshift, line blanketing from the many possible transitions\nbecomes important.\nThe greatly increased filling factor of polluted regions for\nH2 cooling compared to atomic cooling (see Figure 5) suggests\nthat these two scenarios may be distinguished through observations of line statistics. Figure 9 shows that this is indeed\nthe case. We show the statistics for four different transitions\n(O I \u03bb1302; long-dashed lines; C II \u03bb1334, solid lines; Fe II\n\u03bb2344,7 dotted lines; Si II \u03bb1304, short-dashed lines) at z = 20\nand z = 12. The upper set of curves in each panel assumes H2\ncooling and a VMS IMF, while the lower set assumes atomic\ncooling and a Scalo IMF. All other parameters are standard.\nWe also list Wtot for the O I \u03bb1302 transition in each case. The\ndifference between dN/dz for the two models (a factor \u223c 1100\nat z = 20) is even more dramatic than the difference in Q(z)\n(a factor \u223c 500 at z = 20). This occurs because of the rapidly\n\nF IG . 8.- Number of intersections per redshift interval above a given equivalent width threshold at z = 8 for the O I \u03bb1302 transition. The solid lines\nassume f\u2217 = 0.5, 0.1, 0.01, from top to bottom, and fesc = 0.25. The dashed\nlines assume fesc = 1 and 0.1, from top to bottom at left, and f\u2217 = 0.1. All\nother parameters are standard. We also list Wtot (see equation [29]) for the\nsolid curves. Wtot varies only slowly with fesc (see text).\n\nWe also see the effects of a VMS IMF in Figure 9. Although\n\u03c9SN varies by less than a factor \u223c 4 between the two models\n(and is actually larger for a VMS IMF), the explosion energy\nfor the VMS IMF is an order of magnitude larger than for a\nScalo IMF. (Note, however, that even if E51 = 1 for VMS stars,\nthe differences between the two scenarios are large; see Figure\n5). The different yields of the two IMFs also cause differences\nin the relative line strengths. For a Scalo IMF, the strongest features are O I and C II, simply because these are the most abundant elements produced in Type II supernovae. Pair instability\nsupernovae, on the other hand, completely disrupt the star and\ntherefore expel heavy elements much more efficiently (Heger &\nWoosley 2002; see Table 1). As a result, the strongest features\nin VMS winds are O I and Fe II, with C II being the weakest\nfeature.\nWe argued in \u00a73.3 that the low ionization states of metals are\nlikely to be most important, but it is also possible that many\nmetals will be in relatively high ionization states. Figure 10\nshows dN(> W )/dz at z = 8. The thick curves show low ion-\n\n7 We have selected this line from the several available Fe II transitions because it has an \"average\" oscillator strength.

In each case we assume Cm = 1. We see that high\nionization states actually provide a slightly stronger signal than\nthe low ionization states; our previous predictions are therefore conservative in this sense. However, if the metals are even\nmore highly ionized, no observable transitions will remain with\n\u03bbm > \u03bbLy\u03b1 .\n\nsult roughly matches the observationally inferred distance from\nLBGs within which H I is suppressed (Adelberger et al. 2002).8\nOur results for the filling factor Q(z) are consistent with previous work (e.g., Scannapieco, Ferrara, & Madau 2002), but we\nhave emphasized the large uncertainties in the wind modeling\nand the correspondingly large uncertainty in Q(z). We argue\nthat the statistics of metal absorption lines are a useful way to\nconstrain these parameters. Not only are these statistics directly\nobservable, but they are also less dependent on the wind modeling than Q(z) is. Our predictions are therefore relatively robust,\nalthough detailed modeling of the wind structure will be essential for a complete interpretation of the line statistics.\n\nF IG . 9.- Number of intersections per redshift interval above a given equivalent width threshold. In each panel, the bottom set of curves assumes atomic\ncooling while the top set allows H2 cooling. All other parameters take their\nstandard values. We also list Wtot (see equation [29]) for the O I \u03bb1302 transition in each scenario.\n\nFinally, Figure 11 shows the effect of varying other parameters of the outflow model. All the curves assume our standard parameter choices with the following exceptions: fd = 1\n(dotted line), fsw = 1 (dot-dashed line), and no disk formation\n(dashed line). We see that the uncertainty due to model details\nat z = 8 is . 30%. The uncertainties in Q(z) are somewhat larger\n(\u223c 50%), because the integrand of equation (27) is proportional\nto R3 , while dN/dz is proportional to the cross-sectional area\nR2 . Thus our predictions for line statistics are fairly insensitive\nto the detailed wind parameters. Note, however, that the uncertainties increase with redshift, reaching a factor \u223c 2 by z = 20\nfor atomic cooling. At high redshifts, the winds have spent a\nlarger fraction of their expansion within the halo and are hence\nmore sensitive to its structure. In contrast, at low redshifts most\nof the expansion takes place in the IGM and is independent\nof assumptions about the halo structure. Model assumptions\nare much less important in the H2 cooling scenario because the\ncharacteristic halo mass (and hence physical scale over which\nthe halo structure matters) is much smaller.\nWe have examined the absorption by metals in high-z starburst winds seen against a background light source. We allow\neach star-forming halo to host a wind, with a time-dependent\nluminosity determined by its star formation history. We use\nthe thin-shell approximation to trace the size of each wind bubble. Our model predicts that LBG winds can reach a proper\ndistance \u223c 100 kpc from the host. It is encouraging that this re8\n\nF IG . 10.- Number of intersections per redshift interval above a given\nequivalent width threshold at z = 8, assuming our standard parameter choices.\nThick solid, long-dashed, short-dashed, and dotted curves are for C II, O I,\nSi II, and Fe II, respectively. Thin solid and short-dashed curves are for C IV\nand Si IV, respectively. In each case we fix Cm = 1.\n\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nWe estimate that \u223c 40 O I \u03bb1302 lines with equivalent width\nW > 0.5 \u00c5 should be visible per unit redshift at z = 8, assuming\na star formation efficiency f\u2217 = 0.1 and neglecting fragmentation. This decreases to \u223c 0.25 lines per unit redshift by z = 20,\nboth because of the smaller fraction of baryons in collapsed objects and because of the brief time that each wind has had to\nexpand by that time. The normalization and shape of the line\nstatistics will primarily constrain f\u2217 and fesc , the fraction of supernova energy that powers the wind. Because the total amount\nof absorption is proportional to the amount of metals ejected, it\ndepends strongly on f\u2217 but is nearly independent of fesc . The\nratio of strong to weak lines, on the other hand, measures fesc\nbecause that parameter controls the volume over which a fixed\nmetal mass can expand (see Figure 8).\nIf we allow H2 cooling to occur, then we expect \u223c 250 O I\n\u03bb1302 lines per unit redshift at z = 20, because this cooling\nmechanism lowers the threshold halo mass for star formation\nand increases the explosion energy per supernova. In fact, the\ncombined absorption from the several allowed transitions will\neliminate a substantial fraction of the flux from the background\n\nNote that we do not include photoevaporation or infall suppression after reionization (see Barkana & Loeb 2001 and references therein) in our model star formation\nhistories. However, LBGs are the most massive objects at z \u223c 3, for which these processes can be ignored.\n\n\fFurlanetto & Loeb\n\nF IG . 11.- Number of intersections per redshift interval above a given\nequivalent width threshold at z = 8 for the O I \u03bb1302 transition.

This would be straightforward to detect, but\nwould also make isolating individual lines difficult. The dramatic differences between this scenario and the atomic cooling\nscenario are large enough that the two should be easily separable even given our uncertainties in f\u2217 . Metal absorption lines\ntherefore offer a possible route to determine when and if H2\nwas destroyed throughout the IGM. This transition has important implications for the early growth of cosmic structure (e.g.,\nWyithe & Loeb 2002d; Mackey, Bromm, & Hernquist 2002).\nThe relative strengths of the observed lines contain information\nabout the IMF. In particular, Fe lines will be much more prominent if pair instability supernovae dominate (i.e., if the IMF is\nbiased toward very massive stars).\nMetal absorption line studies can shed light on the chemical evolution of the universe. Qian & Wasserburg (2001, 2002)\nhave proposed an important model for the enrichment history\nof the universe based on abundance patterns in Galactic halo\nstars. They argue for a \"prompt\" enrichment phase to a threshold iron abundance [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22123 after which the abundance\npatterns change markedly; below this threshold, VMS supernovae dominate the enrichment, whereas above it \"normal\" supernovae dominate. The authors implicitly assume, based on\nionic abundances in the Ly\u03b1 forest (Qian et al. 2002), that the\nprompt phase uniformly enriches all regions of the IGM to this\nthreshold. Qian et al. (2002) find little evidence for evolution\nin the elemental abundances in the Ly\u03b1 forest over the range\nz \u223c 4.6\u20130.09, indicating that the prompt enrichment occurred\nat z & 5. Qualitatively, we have shown that an early phase\nof halo formation through H2 cooling forming VMS stars can\npollute large regions of the IGM, lending credence to this assumption. Figure 5 shows that complete enrichment of the entire IGM by this epoch requires fairly efficient star formation\n( f\u2217 & 10%) in small halos. In fact, observations of the Ly\u03b1 forest metallicity do not require complete mixing of metals in the\nIGM, because these studies are currently only sensitive to absorbers with NHI & 1014.5 cm\u22122 , corresponding to moderately\n\n13\n\noverdense regions. Metal enrichment is likely to be confined\nin islands that correlate with overdense regions where the Ly\u03b1\nabsorption is enhanced. If VMS regions are preferentially clustered near cosmic overdensities, it is plausible that those regions observable as Ly\u03b1 absorbers with HI column densities\n& 1014.5 cm\u22122 are enriched while other regions remain pristine.\nIn this case, lower star formation efficiencies would be allowed.\nWe would also expect regions polluted by VMS supernovae and\nthose subsequently polluted by normal supernovae to differ in\ntheir abundance patterns. An observational probe of the abundance patterns in the low-density IGM could therefore reveal\nthe era over which the pollution occurred, although any such\nmeasurement would be extremely difficult. Note that the Qian\n& Wasserburg (2001) model assumes a one-to-one, monotonically increasing relation between metallicity and cosmic time.\nIf mixing is not complete at high redshifts, the transition from\n\"very massive\" to \"normal\" star formation may occur at different times in different regions of the universe. Thus, the nonuniformity of the enrichment process, which metal absorption\nline studies probe directly, determines the non-uniformity of the\ntransition between different modes of star formation.\nWe argued that a substantial fraction of the metals are likely\nto exist in low-ionization states (typically C II, O I, Si II, and\nFe II). If, however, the metals exist primarily in higher ionization states, such as C IV and Si IV, then the absorption signal\nwill actually be somewhat easier to observe because the relevant transitions are stronger (see Table 1). Moreover, each of\nthese transitions is a doublet and hence relatively easy to identify unambiguously. If the metals remain in the hot bubble gas\nwith T \u223c 106 K, they will reside in extremely high ionization\nstates (such as O VI) whose resonant transitions are all blueward\nof Ly\u03b1 and therefore unobservable in the high-z IGM.\nThe largest uncertainty in constraining f\u2217 , fesc , H2 cooling,\nand the IMF will probably be the covering factor of the enriched\nmaterial in the wind, CA . Meaningful constraints on this factor must await more detailed models of high-z winds, because\ninferences from observations of local starburst winds may not\napply to sources in the early universe. For example, there are indications that outflows from LBGs are approximately spherical\n(Shapley et al. 2002), unlike the bipolar winds observed in local\nstarbursts. Furthermore, existing observations of absorption by\nstarburst winds and LBG outflows all use the host galaxy as the\nbackground light source and hence probe only the early phases\nof the starburst. Observations using a background source unrelated to the host, such as a quasar or GRB, probe winds of all\nages, which may have much different structure. The analysis\nof Theuns, Mo, & Schaye (2001) implies that winds at z \u223c 3\nmust fragment with CA . 0.01 in order not to overproduce Ly\u03b1\nforest lines. It is, however, unclear whether fragmentation of\nthis degree will occur at the high redshifts we study given the\nsmaller cosmic times available to the winds.\nUnfortunately, uncovering the properties of old winds will\nbe difficult. When the host galaxy is used as the background\nsource, the absorption lines themselves can constrain the structure of the wind because saturated lines fix the fraction of the\ngalaxy hidden by the absorbing medium (e.g., Heckman et al.\n2000). However, our background sources are pointlike and cannot be used in this way. One strategy to study the outflow structure is to compare the strengths of the low and high ionization\ncomponents of individual winds. A better strategy is to compare the absorption along neighboring lines of sight to close\nsources on the sky, such as quasar pairs (e.g., Bechtold et al.\n\n\f14\n1994; Crotts et al. 1994) or multiple images of a single gravitationally lensed source (e.g., Rauch et al. 2002). Lensed quasar\nimages are particularly interesting because the lensing probability increases rapidly with quasar redshift (Wyithe & Loeb\n2002a,b). Such studies can determine the projected extent of\nindividual wind systems and the distribution of metal clouds\nwithin them.\nOur model has two important shortcomings. First, we ignore\nall effects arising from large-scale structure. If star-forming\ngalaxies are highly clustered (as appears likely at very high\nredshifts), then their winds will overlap and decrease the filling fraction of metal-enriched material. Clustered sources will\nalso reside in overdense regions of the IGM, further reducing\nthe wind bubble sizes. Qualitatively, both these effects will reduce the number of intersected lines but increase their average\nstrength. Clustering will also increase the variance in the number of absorption lines per unit redshift, because those lines\nof sight that pass through overdense regions will have greatly\nincreased numbers of intersections. Finally, the filamentary\nnature of large-scale structure will affect the geometry of the\nwinds. Those winds expanding into filaments will stall earlier,\nwhile those expanding into voids will grow more quickly, resulting in anisotropic growth (Theuns et al. 2002). Thus most\nof the enriched volume will be inside voids, which would tend\nto increase the filling fraction. For example, with the extreme\nassumption that all winds expand into a medium with \u03c1g equal\nto one-tenth the mean density of the universe, the filling factor\nof enriched material increases by a factor \u223c 3\u20135. On the other\nhand, if wind sources are embedded in overdense regions, the\nfilling factor decreases even more dramatically because Mmax\ndecreases rapidly. Unfortunately, a detailed treatment of clustering and the anisotropic expansion around filaments requires\nconsiderably more machinery than is developed here and is best\naddressed through numerical simulations. We have chosen a\nsimilar wind model to Springel & Hernquist (2002), so our results should help to interpret the effects of the wind model parameterization in such simulations.\nThe second shortcoming of our model is the long-term fate of\nthe winds. They are likely to fragment due to cooling instabilities or inhomogeneities in the ambient medium. If turbulence\nis present, the fragments will then mix with the surrounding\nIGM. Provided that this mixing occurs at approximately the\nsound speed, our estimates of the total filled volume will not\nbe grossly changed; however, fragmentation could strongly affect the covering fraction of the metals (see above) and their\nvelocity widths.\nThere are at least two types of astronomical objects that can\nfunction as background sources. The most obvious are quasars.\nBright quasars have been observed to z = 6.3 (Fan et al. 2002)\nand likely extend to z \u223c 10 (Haiman & Loeb 2001). However, the characteristic quasar luminosity is expected to decline\nsharply with increasing redshift (Wyithe & Loeb 2002c) and it\nwould be difficult to find luminous quasars at much higher redshifts. Quasars also suffer from complicated intrinsic absorption, and isolating weak IGM metal lines may be challenging.\nAnother possibility is to use gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as the\nbackground sources. If GRBs are associated with massive star\nformation, some likely occur at extremely high redshifts (Lamb\n9\n\nSee http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu:3636/realpublic/inst/nirspec/nirspec.html.\nSee http://www.eso.org/instruments/isaac/.\n11 See http://www.stsci.edu/ngst/.\n12 See http://www.ngst.stsci.edu/nms/index.html.\n10\n\n& Reichart 2000; Bromm & Loeb 2002). Cosmic time dilation\nand a favorable K-correction imply that, at a given time after the\nburst in the observer frame, the decrease in brightness with z is\nmild. Ciardi & Loeb (2000) show that the 2\u03bcm flux of a GRB at\nz & 10 declines from \u223c 200 \u03bcJy 1 hr after the burst to \u223c 1 \u03bcJy\n10 days after the burst. GRBs are also attractive sources because of their intrinsic power-law spectra, from which it will be\nstraightforward to find absorption lines. Furthermore, if GRBs\noccur in actively star-forming galaxies that drive winds into the\nsurrounding IGM, the absorption spectrum can probe the host\ngalaxy wind in detail. Because GRBs fade, they also serve as\nuseful markers of faint galaxies at high redshifts. Subsequent\ndeep imaging of the host could reveal details that complement\nthe information from absorption line studies.\nObserving IGM metal lines at high redshifts presents a variety of challenges. Most importantly, it requires relatively high\nresolution spectroscopy of faint sources in the near to midinfrared (1\u03bcm . \u03bb . 5\u03bcm). Resolving individual winds requires a spectral resolution R \u223c c/vexp \u223c 6000 (50 km s\u22121 /vexp ).\nSuch resolution is currently achievable with the NIRSPEC camera on the Keck telescope9 and with the ISAAC camera on the\nVery Large Telescope.10 However, any ground-based observation in this wavelength range will suffer from sky contamination that worsens significantly as the wavelength increases;\nthus, ground-based measurements will be limited to z . 10,\nand even then will require bright sources. The James Webb\nSpace Telescope,11 due for launch in the next decade, will have\nthe sensitivity to probe much fainter background sources with\na spectral resolution R = 5000. The Mission Simulator12 estimates that a source with F\u03bd \u223c 1 \u03bcJy will require a \u223c 16\u201324 hr\nintegration to achieve S/N = 10 per resolution element at wavelengths 1.5\u20134\u03bcm. Thus spectroscopy of high-z GRB afterglows\nwith this instrument will allow us to probe IGM metal lines at\nz & 10 in detail.\nAnother challenge lies in identifying the lines. In the case of\nC IV and Si IV, the ratio of line strengths in the doublets will\nhelp to confirm the identity of the transition and hence the redshift of the line. However, the low ionization states lack doublet\ntransitions in the relevant wavelength range. One would therefore need to identify multiple lines at each redshift in order to\nconfirm the presence of an individual absorbing wind. The feasibility of this technique is then limited not by the strongest\nlines but by the weaker transitions.\nFinally, we note that absorption line observations such as\nthose we propose can be combined with imaging surveys to\nlearn even more about the enrichment process. Adelberger et al.\n(2002) have already shown the usefulness of such an approach\nfor understanding the influence Lyman-break galaxies have on\ntheir surroundings. Though difficult, similar observations over\na large redshift range have the promise to map out the history\nof galaxy feedback on the IGM.\nWe thank C. Steidel and A.
