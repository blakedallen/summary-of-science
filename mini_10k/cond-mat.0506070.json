In socalled quantum spin liquids spin correlation remains\nshort-range even at zero temperature, and the excitation spectrum is gapped. This disorder is relatively robust and such systems resist long-range ordering even in\nthe presence of residual 3D interactions or anisotropy.\nIn contrast, gapless low-dimensional magnets are very\nsensitive to external perturbations that can easily drive\nthem towards long-range ordering. New physics is found\nin bicomponent systems that combine these two distinct\ntypes of low-dimensional spin networks. An example is\nR2 BaNiO5 materials where Haldane spin chains weakly\ninteract with magnetic rare earth ions. 1,2,3 More recently, we reported the discovery and study of a novel\nquantum ferrimagnet Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 .4,5 We showed that\nthis compound can be viewed as a system of antiferromagnetic (AF) Cu-dimers that weakly interact with almost classical Fe3+ chains. This weak coupling leads to\na rather unusual cooperative ordering phase transition at\nlow temperatures.\nThe crystal structure of Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 is monoclinic\nP 21 /m with a = 12.101 \u00c5, b = 8.497 \u00c5, c = 4.869 \u00c5,\nand \u03b2 = 96.131\u25e6.5 The arrangement of magnetic ions and\nlikely exchange pathways is shown in Fig. 1 (a). Fe3+\nions form crankshaft-shaped chains that run in the b direction. These chains are separated by GeO4 tetrahedra\nin c direction. The Cu2+ dimers are located in-between\nFe3+ chains along the a direction. Simultaneous cooperative long-range magnetic ordering of the two magnetic\n\nsubsystems occurs at 40 K.5 The magnetic structure is\nroughly collinear, with spins lying in the crystallographic\na - c plane. In addition, there are small out-of-plane\nspin components (canting). The saturation magnetic\nmoment on Cu2+ ions is anomalously small, being suppressed by residual quantum fluctuations in the dimers:\nmCu = 0.38(4)\u03bcB . This suggests that the coupling\nJCu\u2212Fe between the Cu-dimers to the Fe-subsystem is\nweak compared to intra-dimer AF interactions JCu . The\npairs of Cu-spins remain in a spin-singlet state that is\nonly partially polarized by interactions with the longrange order in the Fe-subsystem. The data collected in\npreliminary inelastic neutron scattering experiments for\nenergy transfers up to 10 meV could be well explained\nby fluctuations of Fe3+ spins alone. The Fe3+ spins form\nweakly-coupled S = 5/2 chains, the corresponding effective exchange constants being JFe = 1.60(2) meV,\n\u2032\nJFe\n= 0.12(1) meV, as shown in Fig. 1. These values\nare consistent with rough estimates of exchange constants\nbased on magnetic susceptibility data: JFe = 1.7 meV,\nJCu = 25 meV. To date, no excitations associated with\nthe Cu-dimers could be identified.\nWhile the very nature of the crankshaft-shaped chains\nimplies some alternation of bond strength, we find no\nevidence thereof in the measured dispersion curves. In\nfact, they are well reproduced by a model involving uniform magnetic Fe-chains with weak interchain interactions along the c direction. In the remainder of this work\nwe shall therefore disregard the bond-alternation and assume the Fe-chains to be magnetically uniform.\nIn the present paper we report a more detailed inelastic\nneutron scattering study of Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 . Our main re-\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nFIG. 1: (a) A schematic view of the crystal structure of\nCu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 . Only magnetic ions are shown. Arrows symbolize the spin structure in the magnetically ordered phase.\nPossible exchange pathways are also shown. (b) Relative orientations of reciprocal-lattice vectors for the two domains in\nbulk crystalline samples with twinning.\n\nsult is an observation of a complete separation of energy\nscales for Cu2+ - and Fe3+ -centered magnetic excitations.\nAn analysis of the intensity pattern for low-energy spin\nwaves allows us to unambiguously associate them with\nthe dynamics of S = 5/2 chains. In addition, separate\nnarrow-band excitation originating from Cu subsystem\nis observed at higher energy transfers. The layout of the\npaper will be as follows. In section II we will describe the\ncharacteristics of our samples and experimental setups.\nSection III describes the results for low-energy excitations in single-crystal samples, as well as measurements\nof the much weaker high energy excitations in a largevolume powder sample. In Section IV we shall interpret\nthe observed separation of energy scales by a Mean FieldRandom Phase Approximation (MF-RPA) treatment of\ninteractions between Cu2+ - and Fe3+ spins. Discussion\nand conclusion will be drawn in Section V and VI, respectively.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nHigh quality single crystals with the dimension of 3 \u00d7\n4 \u00d7 35 mm3 were grown by the floating zone method. All\nsamples were found to be twinned. The two twins share\na common (b, c) plane, the monoclinic structure allowing\ntwo independent orientations of the a axis. In reciprocal space the domains share a common (a\u2217 , b\u2217 ) plane,\nbut have distinct c\u2217 axes, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (b).\nTwo separate single crystals were co-aligned to obtain\na larger sample of cumulative mosaic spread 0.44\u25e6 . For\nsingle crystal inelastic neutron scattering experiments we\nexploited four different setups. Setup I employed the\nSPINS cold neutron spectrometer at the NIST Center\nfor Neutron Research (NCNR). The scattering plane was\n\u2032\ndefined by the b\u2217 and the bisector c \u2217 of the c\u2217 axes in the\ntwo crystallographic domains, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). In\nthis geometry the scattering planes are\nthe same in both\n\u2032\ndomains. It is convenient to define c \u2217 \u2261 c\u2217 cos(\u03b2 \u2212 90\u25e6 ).\nThe momentum transfer in the scattering plane of the\nspectrometer is then indexed by Miller indexes h\u2032 , k \u2032\nand l\u2032 of a fictitious orthorhombic\nstructure. For the\n\u2032\ntwo domains h = \u00b1(c \u2217 /a\u2217 )l\u2032 tan(\u03b2 \u2212 90\u25e6 ), k = k \u2032 and\nl = l\u2032 . Since \u03b2 is close to 90\u25e6 , h is almost zero for most\nmeasurements using Setup 1, where l is small. In Setup\n2 the scattering plane was (a\u2217 , b\u2217 ), which is also common for the two domain types. In both setups we used\n(guide) \u2212 80\u2032 \u2212 80\u2032 \u2212 (open) collimation with a Be filter positioned after the sample and a fixed final energy\nEf = 5 meV or 3 meV. The data were collected at T = 1.4\nK using a standard He-flow cryostat. Setup 3 was used\nfor wide surveys in reciprocal space and employed the\nHB1 thermal neutron spectrometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at ORNL. The scattering plane was (a\u2217 , b\u2217 )\n, as in Setup 2. The collimation was 48\u2032 \u2212 40\u2032 \u2212 40\u2032 \u2212 240\u2032 .\nNeutrons with Ef = 13.5 meV were used in conjunction\nwith a Pyrolytic graphite (PG) filter positioned after the\nsample. The experiments in Setup 3 were performed at\nT = 6.4 K maintained by a closed-cycle He refrigerator.\nIntensity was the main limiting factor for studies of\nhigher-energy magnetic excitations. To maximize sample volume the measurements were performed on a 50 g\npolycrystalline Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 powder that was prepared\nby the solid state reaction method. This experiment was\nperformed on the HB3 3-axis spectrometer at HFIR with\n48\u2032 \u2212 40\u2032 \u2212 60\u2032 \u2212 120\u2032 collimations and a PG filter after\nthe sample (Setup 4). The final neutron energy was fixed\nat Ef = 14.7 meV. A closed-cycle refrigerator was used\nto achieve low temperatures.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULT\nA.\n\nLow energies\n\nIn this section we concentrate on the low energy excitations at energy transfers up to 10 meV. As was explained\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Energy scans collected in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 for momentum transfers q = (0 k 0.5). White and grey circles correspond to measurements with Ef = 5 and 3 meV, respectively.\nSolid lines are Gaussian fits.\n\n5\n\nin our preliminary report and will be discussed in detail\nbelow, this part of the spectrum can be associated with\nconventional spin waves from the Fe-subsystem. The Cudimers only provide an effective Fe-Fe interaction, but\ncontribute nothing to the dynamics at low energies.\nTypical energy scans at q = (0 k 0.5) measured using setup 1 are shown in Fig. 2. White and grey circles\ncorrespond to data collected with Ef = 5 meV and 3\nmeV respectively. Well defined resolution-limited peaks\nare observed in the entire Brillouin zone. Solid lines are\nGaussian fits to the data after a subtraction of a linear background. The excitation energy is a minimum at\nthe magnetic zone center at q = (0 2.0 0.5). A small\ngap of about 1.6 meV is observed at this wave vector.\nThe apparent shoulder structure can be attributed to a\nsplitting of the spin wave branch into two components\nwith somewhat different gap energies. The gaps are most\nlikely anisotropy-related. The zone-boundary energy at\nq = (0 3.0 0.5) is about 9 meV. The dispersion relation\n\nFIG. 3: Measured energies (a) and integrated intensities (b)\nof magnetic excitations as a function of momentum transfer\nalong the b\u2217 direction (symbols). Lines are as described in\nthe text.\n\nwas obtained by Gaussian fits to individual scans and is\nshown in Fig. 3 (a). The k-dependence of the measured\nenergy-integrated peak intensity is plotted in symbols in\nFig. 3 (b). The intensity scales roughly as 1/\u03c9.\nEnergy scans at q = (0 2.0 l) and (0 2.9 l) are shown\nin Fig. 4. Constraints on experimental geometry prevented us from reaching the more symmetric (0 3.0 l)\nreciprocal-space rods at higher energy transfers. These\ntwo sets of data reveal two distinct excitation branches,\nthat are strongest near even and odd k-values, respectively. The former branch is dispersive along the c axis,\nwhile the latter one is almost flat. Dispersion relations\nand the integrated intensity plots for both modes were\nobtained using Gaussian fits and are shown in Fig. 5\n(a) and (b). Even for the more dispersive lower-energy\n\u2032\nbranch the booundary energy along the c \u2217 direction is\nonly about 5 meV: about half of that in the b\u2217 direction.\nNo dispersion of low-energy excitations could be detected along the a\u2217 direction. This is illustrated by the\nenergy scans collected on the (h 2.0 0) reciprocal-space\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: Energy scans collected in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 for several\nmomentum transfers along the c\u2217 direction. Symbols and\nlines are as in Fig. 2.\n\nrod using Setup 2 (Fig. 6). Two peaks are observed at\n5 and 9 meV, respectively. The excitation energies are\nplotted in Fig. 7 (a). Interestingly, the peak intensity is\nstrongly dependent on h, as shown in Fig. 7 (b).\nFrom the data presented above one can immediately\nconclude that the most relevant magnetic interactions\nare within the Fe3+ layers, parallel to the (b, c) plane.\nInter-layer coupling along the a-direction is considerably\nweaker. Based on structural considerations, it must involve the Cu2+ spins.\n\nB.\n\nHigher-energy excitations\n\nThe model that we previously proposed for\nFe2 Cu2 Ge4 O13\n(Ref.\n5) implies a separation of\nenergy scales of spin wave like excitations on the Fe\nsubsystem and triplet excitations of the Cu dimers.\nFrom magnetic susceptibility measurements we have estimated the intra-dimer exchange constant to be around\n25 meV. Due to small sample size, in single crystal\nexperiments we failed to observe any clear magnetic\ninelastic features in this energy transfer range. To\nsearch for the Cu-triplet mode we performed additional\nmeasurements on a large-size powder sample.\n\nFIG. 5: Measured energies (a) and integrated intensities (b)\nof magnetic excitations as a function of momentum transfer\nalong the c\u2217 direction. The solid and open circles correspond\nto the higher- and lower-energy branches, respectively. Lines\nare as described in the text.\n\nThe powder data collected at T = 12 K are summarized in the false color plot in Fig. 8 (a). The data were\nobtained by combining 17 separate constant-q scans. For\neach such scan a linear background was subtracted from\nthe measured intensity. Figure 8 (a) clearly shows a narrow excitation band at ~\u03c9 \u223c 24 meV. The measured\nintensity of the 24 meV peak decreases with the increase\nof q, as expected for magnetic scattering. The observed\nenergy width at q = 2.3 \u00c5\u22121 is somewhat larger than\nexperimental resolution, but still small compared to the\ncentral energy (Fig. 8 (b)). Such energy dependence in\npowder samples typically indicates a narrow dispersion\nbandwidth (see, for example, Refs. 6,7). The observed\nspectrum is consistent with the excitations originating\nfrom the structural Cu-dimers, indicated by the thick\nsolid bonds in Fig. 1 (a). However, the momentum transfer range covered in the experiment, especially at |q| \u2192 0\nis insufficient for a more detailed analysis of the structure\nfactor. In particular, the size of the dimers can not be\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 6: Energy scans measured in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 for momentum transfers q = (h 2.0 0). Symbols and lines are as in\nFig. 2.\n\nindependently extracted from the experimental data.\nTo obtain additional information on the 24 meV excitation we studied its temperature dependence at q\n= 2.3 \u00c5\u22121 . The main challenge was dealing with a\nlarge background that originates from (i) temperatureindependent scattering, including spurious scattering\nfrom an \"accidental\" Bragg powder line at 24.8 meV and\n(ii) temperature-dependent phonon scattering. These\ntwo contributions can be removed from the data if one\nassumes that the useful magnetic signal is relatively weak\nand/ or temperature-independent above T = 200 K. This\nwould indeed be true if the magnetic scattering originated from effectively isolated Cu-dimers with an intradimer exchange constant of 24 meV. The phonon contribution, which is assumed to scale with the Bose factor,\nis thus estimated from comparing scans at T = 300 K and\nT = 200 K. It is then appropriately scaled and subtracted\nfrom all scans, leaving only the true magnetic signal and\nthe T -independent background. The two can not, in principle, be reliably separated. However, we can follow the\n\nFIG. 7: (a) Measured energies (a) and integrated intensities (b) of magnetic excitations as a function of momentum\ntransfer along the a\u2217 direction. Symbols and lines are as in\nFig. 5.\n\nchange in magnetic signal from T = 200 K by using the\nphonon-subtracted T = 200 K scan as \"background\".\nThe result of this elaborate background subtraction is\nplotted in Fig. 9. The well-defined peak seen at low temperature broadens progressively with increasing T and\npractically disappears at T & 40 K. In this range there\nalso seems to be a downward shift in the peak's central\nenergy.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nSeparation of energy scales\n\nTo understand the dynamics of the coupled Fe3+ and\nCu2+ subsystems we shall make the central assumption\nthat the exchange constant JCu that binds pairs of Cu2+\nspins into AF dimers is the largest energy scale in the sys-\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 8: (a) False-color plot of inelastic intensity measured in\nCu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 powder samples as a function of energy and\nmomentum transfer. (b) Typical energy scans measured at\nT = 12 K for different momentum transfers. Heavy solid\nlines are Gaussian fits. The shaded Gaussians represent experimental energy resolution.\n\ntem. Under these circumstances the degrees of freedom\nassociated with Cu-spins can be effectively integrated out\nat low energies. Indeed, the isolated Cu2+ -subsystem\nhas a spin singlet ground state and a large energy gap\n\u2206 = JCu . At ~\u03c9 \u226a \u2206 it lacks any intrinsic dynamics,\ni.e., its dynamic susceptibility is purely real and almost\nenergy-independent. In the spirit of RPA, from the point\nof view of Fe3+ spins, the Cu-dimers merely act as a polarizable medium that can transfer magnetic interactions\nbetween the Fe-layers. The staggered spin susceptibility of each S = 1/2 dimer being 2/(JCu ), this effective\ncoupling, labeled as Jeff in Fig. 1 is given by:\n2\nJ eff = JCu\u2212Fe\n/(2JCu ).\n\n(1)\n\nThus, to a good approximation, the low-energy spin dynamics of Fe2 Cu2 Ge4 O13 is simply that of the Fe3+ subsystem with an additional exchange coupling. From\nthe experiment, where no dispersion of spin waves could\nbe observed along the a-axis, the effective exchange constant must be rather small. Nevertheless, as explained in\n\nFIG. 9: Typical energy scans at measured in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13\npowder at q = 2.3 \u00c5\u22121 for different temperatures. Solid lines\nare Gaussian fits. The background has been subtracted, as\nexplained in the text.\n\nour previous paper,5 it is absolutely crucial in completing a 3-dimensional spin network and allowing long-range\nmagnetic ordering at a non-zero temperature.\nAt high energy transfers, comparable to the Cu-dimer\ngap, it is the Fe3+ degrees of freedom that can be effectively integrated out. At T < TN their effect is reduced\nto producing a static staggered exchange spin field that\nacts on the Cu2+ spins and is proportional to the ordered\nFe3+ moment:\nhCu = hSFe iJCu\u2212Fe .\n\n(2)\n\nIn our approximation at high energy transfers\nCu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 behaves as a collection of (possibly\ninteracting) Cu-dimers in an effective staggered field.5\nB.\n\nSpin waves and dynamic structure factor for\nlow energies\n\nAs explained above, the low-energy spectrum of\nCu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 can be understood by considering the Fesubsystem in isolation, and even Jeff can be ignored for\nits smallness. For the magnetically ordered state the dynamic structure factor of such a system can be calculated\n\n\f7\nusing conventional spin wave theory (SWT). For simplicity we shall assume a collinear magnetic structure, ignoring the small canting of the Fe3+ spins out of the (a, c)\nplane.\n\nFIG. 10: Spatial arrangement of Fe3+ -sites in the structure of\nCu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 (open circles) and an equivalent Bravais lattice\nof spins (solid circles).\n\nEven though there are four Fe ions in each unit cell\nof Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 , the topology of exchange interactions\n\u2032\ndefined by JFe and JFe\nin Fig. 1 is that of a regular Bravais lattice. This equivalency is illustrated in Fig. 10.\nThe exact relation between the actual structure factor\nS(q, \u03c9) and S0 (q, \u03c9) for the equivalent lattice is readily\nobtained:\n\n1\nS(q, \u03c9) = S0 (q, \u03c9) cos2 2\u03c0\u03b4a h cos2 2\u03c0\u03b4b k + S0 (q + (0, 1, 0), \u03c9)(1 + sin2 2\u03c0\u03b4a h sin2 2\u03c0\u03b4b k)\n2\n1\n2\n2\n+ S0 (q + (0, 2, 0), \u03c9) cos 2\u03c0\u03b4a h sin 2\u03c0\u03b4b k + S0 (q + (0, 3, 0), \u03c9)(1 + sin2 2\u03c0\u03b4a h sin2 2\u03c0\u03b4b k),\n2\n\n\u03b4a = 0.1239, \u03b4b = 0.0629.\n\n(3b)\n\nHere \u03b4a and \u03b4b are the displacements of Fe3+ ions from\nhigh-symmetry positions, as shown in Fig. 1 (b).\nThe SWT dynamic structure factor for a collinear antiferromagnet on a Bravais lattice is well known:8\nS0 (q, \u03c9) = (uq + vq )2 \u03b4(~\u03c9q \u2212 ~\u03c9)\nS(~\u03c9q + 2Sj(0))\nu2q =\n,\n~\u03c9q\n2S 2 j(q)\n,\nuq vq = \u2212\n~\u03c9q\np\n~\u03c9q = S j(0)2 \u2212 j(q)2 + \u22062 .\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n(4c)\n(4d)\n\nHere j(q) is the Fourier transform of exchange interactions, and \u2206 empirically accounts for the anisotropy\ngap. In our particular case of the Fe3+ subsystem in\nCu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 we have:\n\u03c0\n\u2032\nj(q) = 2(JFe cos k + JFe\ncos 2\u03c0l),\n(5)\n2\nThe cross section for inelastic neutron scattering from\nspin waves is given by:\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #\nd2 \u03c3\nqy\nhnq + 1iS(q, \u03c9), (6)\n\u221d |F (q)|2 1 +\nd\u03a9dE\nq\nIn this formula F (q) is the magnetic form factor for Fe3+ ,\nhnq i is the Bose factor and qz is the projection of the\n\n(3a)\n\nscattering vector onto the direction of ordered Fe3+ moments.\nC.\n\nFits to data\n\nThe model cross section given by Eq. (6) can accurately reproduce the observed low-energy spectra in\nCu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 . Due to the presence of four terms in\nEq. (3), there are four distinct spin wave branches, that\nwe shall denote as modes I through IV, correspondingly.\nThe dispersion relation given by Eq. (4d) was fit to the\nexperimental data shown in Figs. 3 (a) and 5 (a) using\na least-squares algorithm. A good fit is obtained with\n\u2032\nJFe = 1.60 meV, JFe\n= 0.12 meV, and \u2206 = 2.02 meV.\nThe result is shown in lines in figures 3a and 5a. With\nthese parameters our model also agrees well with the\nmeasured dispersion (or, rather, absence thereof) along\nthe a axis, as shown in 7a.\nWhat is important, is that not only the energies, but\nalso the intensities of the observed excitations are well\nreproduced by our model. Calculated intensities for each\nmode or combined intensities of a couple of modes in\ncases where experimental energy resolution is insufficient to resolve individual branches, are shown in lines\nin Figs. 3b, 5b and 7b. This quantitative agreement between the measured and observed structure factors confirms that the scattering is indeed due to Fe3+ spins. An\nexcellent illustration of this was obtained by mapping out\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 11: (a) Constant energy scans at ~\u03c9 = 8.5 meV in wide\nq = (h k 0) range. (b) Simulation based of our model cross\nsection convoluted with the experimental resolution function.\n\nthe scattering intensity in a wide q-range using Setup 4,\nas shown in Fig. 11 (a). These data correspond to a\nfixed energy transfer ~\u03c9 = 8.5 meV, and have a characteristic checkerboard pattern. Our spin wave model\nwith the parameters quoted above reproduces this behavior very well, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). In this calculation the model cross section was numerically convoluted\nwith the known experimental resolution function. The\napparent periodicity along k is due to a steep dispersion\nthat takes the excitations in and out of the probed energy range. However, the periodicity along h is related to\nthe trigonometric coefficients in Eq. (3a). These, in turn,\nare determined by the geometry of the crankshaft-shaped\nFe3+ chains in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 .\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs demonstrated above, the low-energy spin dynamics\nof Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 is well described by an effective spin\n\nwave theory for the Fe3+ spin chains. Based on the available data it is impossible to unambiguously associate the\nobserved 24 meV mode with the Cu2+ dimers. However,\nmuch confidence in this assumption can be drawn from\na recent study of Cu2 Sc2 Ge4 O13 .9 In this isostructural\ncompound10 only the Cu2+ ions are magnetic. Indeed\nthe magnetic susceptibility showed S = 1/2-dimers behavior with similar energy to Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 .9\nWe can now estimate all the relevant exchange interactions in the system. Using Eq. (2) in combination\nwith the staggered susceptibility of an isolated antiferromagnetic dimer, from the known saturation moments\nhSCu i = 0.18(8) and hSFe i = 1.77(4) for Cu2+ and\nFe3+ , respectively,5 we get JCu\u2212Fe = 2.54(3) meV. The\neffective coupling is then J eff = 0.13(4) meV. The results for all exchange parameters are summarized in Table I.\nOur model for Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 is qualitatively consistent with the observed slight increase of the energy of\nthe Cu-dimer mode with decreasing temperature. Indeed, the gap energy of isolated dimers, as that of other\ngapped systems, is known to increase with the application of a staggered field.11,12 In Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 this field\nis generated by the ordered moment on the Fe3+ sites,\nand at T < TN increases proportionately to hSFe i. Beyond that, the observed T -dependence of the 24 meV\nmode is different from that for isolated dimers. In the\nlatter, the intensity would remain almost constant below T = 40 K. Moreover, the peak would remain sharp\nat all temperatures. The discrepancy may be related\nto intrinsic limitations of the MF/RPA approach, and\nmerits further investigation. In particular, it is tempting to somehow associate the observed emergence and\nsharpening of the 24 meV inelastic peak with the onset\nof long-range order.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur data bring solid quantitative support to the concept of separation of energy scales in the mixed-spin\nquantum antiferromagnet Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 . Using a simple MF/RPA approach we are able to determine all the\nrelevant exchange interactions. However, certain features\nof the temperature dependence of spin excitations require\nfurther theoretical and experimental study.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWork at ORNL was carried out under Contracts No.\nDE-AC05-00OR22725, US Department of Energy.
