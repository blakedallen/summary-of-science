The rich variety of the\nobserved molecules implies that many more relevant yet undiscovered species must be involved in the processes of their formation and destruction. Still, only a tiny fraction of these\nspecies have been firmly detected in several protoplanetary disks, including CO (and its isotopes), CN, HCN, HNC, H2 CO, C2 H, CS, HCO+ , H13 CO+ , DCO+ , and N2 H+ (Dutrey et al.\n1997; Kastner et al. 1997; van Zadelhoff et al. 2001; Qi et al. 2003; Thi et al. 2004). Multimolecule, multi-transition observations of emission lines with (sub-)millimeter interferometers and single-dish antennas provide a wealth of information about planet-forming disks\nresembling the young Solar Nebula (Simon et al. 2000; Aikawa et al. 2003; Qi et al. 2005;\nPety et al. 2006; Dutrey et al. 2007).\n1\n\nhttp://astrochemistry.net\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nAn ultimate goal of disk studies is the reconstruction of the evolutionary history and spatial abundance distribution of various species, which requires sophisticated chemical models\n(Willacy & Langer 2000; Markwick et al. 2002; van Zadelhoff et al. 2003; Ilgner et al. 2004;\nSemenov et al. 2005; Aikawa & Nomura 2006; Tscharnuter & Gail 2007). The analysis and\nmodeling of observational data acquired with limited spatial and spectral resolution is not\ncomplete without taking all possible uncertainties into account such as instrumental errors,\nuncertainties in the distance to source, orientation, etc. Whereas these uncertainties can in\ngeneral be reduced either by using better observational data provided by current interferometers (PdBI, SMA) equipped with a new generation of receivers or in the future with the\nadvent of more powerful instruments like ALMA, EVLA, and Herschel, there is an intrinsic\nsource of ambiguity in all the chemical models \u2013 our limited knowledge of the reaction rate\ncoefficients.\nModern astrochemical databases include up to about 4 500 gas-phase reactions and \u223c\n450 species (Millar et al. 1997; Le Teuff et al. 2000; Smith et al. 2004; Woodall et al. 2007),\nbut many of these reactions have poorly estimated rate coefficients with uncertainties of\nabout a factor of 2 and larger. For example, radiative association reactions lead to the\nformation of new complex species out of smaller ones through the photon relaxation of an\nexcited collisional molecular complex. Under low-density space conditions where three-body\nprocesses are unlikely, these reactions may have rate coefficients as high as \u223c 10\u22129 cm3 s\u22121\nand as low as \u223c 10\u221217 cm3 s\u22121 , depending on the density of vibrational states of the complex.\nThe radiative association rates are usually difficult to measure in the laboratory as well as to\npredict theoretically, especially for bigger species (Bates 1951; Williams 1972; Herbst 1980).\nIn contrast, dissociative recombination of molecular ions almost always proceeds very\nrapidly, in particular at low temperature, with rate coefficients that can be accurately obtained (Florescu-Mitchell & Mitchell 2006). However, the products and their relative branching fractions branching channels of many dissociative recombination reactions are not known\nprecisely, particularly at low temperatures (see though Semaniak et al. 2001; Ishii et al. 2006;\n\u00d6jekull et al. 2006), which may spoil theoretical predictions (see, e.g. Millar et al. 1988;\nGeppert et al. 2005a).\nRecently, Vasyunin et al. (2004, Paper I hereafter) investigated the influence of uncertainties in rate coefficients on molecular abundances in dense and diffuse clouds, using\nthe gas-phase UMIST 95 database. They found that the abundance uncertainties of simple\nspecies are limited to within about an order of magnitude and increase substantially with\nthe number of atoms in the molecule, though the uncertainties still do not exceed the observational errors for simple molecules. They proposed a sensitivity analysis to identify those\nreactions that introduce the largest errors in the computed concentrations. Wakelam et al.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n(2005, hereafter Paper II) studied uncertainties in the gas-phase chemistry of hot cores and\ndemonstrated that at late times, & 104 yr, modeled abundances of important molecules\ncan suffer from large uncertainties due to poorly known rate coefficients. Wakelam et al.\n(2006a) focused on dense cloud chemistry and took uncertainties in the physical parameters\ninto account, as well as comparing the osu.2003 and UMIST 99 chemistries. These authors\ncame to conclusions that grain-surface reactions should be considered in order to achieve\nbetter consistency with the observational data, even though there is a large degree of ambiguity in simple cloud models based on static physical and chemical structures. Finally,\nWakelam et al. (2006b) expanded this study by using their uncertainty analysis to show\nthat there is a bistability in the abundances of many species that are hyper-sensitive to the\nadopted value of the ratio of the cosmic ray ionization rate of helium to that of hydrogen (see\nalso Pineau des Forets et al. 1992; Shalabiea & Greenberg 1995; Boger & Sternberg 2006).\nFurthermore, Izzard et al. (2007) recently studied the effect of proton-capture reaction rate\nuncertainties in the NeNa and MgAl chains on the abundances of the Ne, Na, Mg and Al\nisotopes produced in intermediate-mass AGB stars.\nDespite previous work in rate uncertainties, to the best of our knowledge, there have\nbeen no attempts in the literature to study how these reaction uncertainties, which are\nunlikely to be eliminated in the near future, affect the results of astrochemical modeling\nin the wide range of physical conditions typical of protoplanetary disks. In this paper, we\nextend the previous analyses by Vasyunin et al. (2004, Paper I) and Wakelam et al. (2005,\nPaper II) to the conditions of a low-mass protoplanetary disk surrounding a young T Tauri\nstar. The aims of our study are several. First, we analyze how large the abundance and\ncolumn density scatter for key species are due to uncertainties in rate coefficients. Second, we\ninvestigate how these uncertainties vary with disk location. Third, we isolate the reactions\nwhose rate uncertainties contribute most to the abundance scatter and which are therefore\nworth studying in detail. Last, we predict how the overall consistency of theoretical models\nwill be improved after these reaction rates are better constrained.\nThe organization of our paper is the following. The adopted disk physical structure\nand time-dependent gas-grain chemical model are presented in Sect. 2.1. The Monte Carlo\nmethod used to introduce the uncertainties in the RATE 06 reaction rates is described in\nSect. 2.2. In Section 3 we report computed distributions of the mean molecular abundances\nand column densities and their errors in the whole disk, and analyze the influence of the rate\ncoefficient uncertainties on these quantities. A correlation method that allows determination\nof the role of various reactions in the abundance uncertainties as a function of time and disk\nlocation is outlined, and results for several key species are presented in Sect. 4.1. Particular\nattention is paid to the identification of the most uncertain reactions for the chemical evolution of key species in the entire disk. In Sect. 4.2 we predict to what extent the abundance\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nscatter due to the rate uncertainties will be lowered when accurate rate values of several\ndozens most problematic reactions are available. The remainder of Section 4 is concerned\nwith problems in different classes of reactions. Final conclusions are drawn in Sect 5.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nDisk model and uncertainty approach\n\nPhysical structure and chemical model of the disk\n\nIn our simulations, we adopted the 1+1D steady-state irradiated disk model with vertical\ntemperature gradient that represents the low-mass Class II protoplanetary disk surrounding\nthe young T Tauri star DM Tau (D'Alessio et al. 1999). The disk has a radius of 800 AU, an\naccretion rate \u1e40 = 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , a viscosity parameter \u03b1 = 0.01, and a mass M \u2243 0.07 M\u2299\n(Dutrey et al. 1997; Pi\u00e9tu et al. 2007). The thermal and density structure of the disk is\nshown in Fig. 1. As a disk age we used a value of \u223c 5 Myr, which has been derived by\nSimon et al. (2000) based on evolutionary track modeling of the central star. In chemical\nsimulations an outer disk region beyond the distance of 50 AU from the central star is\nconsidered. This is the only routinely accessible disk region with existing (sub-)millimeter\ninterferometers.\nWe assumed that the disk is illuminated by UV radiation from the central star with\nan intensity G = 410 G0 at r = 100 AU (G(r) \u221d r \u22120.5 ) and by interstellar UV radiation\nwith intensity G0 in plane-parallel geometry (Draine 1978; van Dishoeck 1988; Bergin et al.\n2003; Dutrey et al. 2007). The dust grains are assumed to be uniform 0.1 \u03bcm spherical\nparticles made of amorphous silicates with olivine stoichiometry (Semenov et al. 2003), with\na dust-to-gas mass ratio of 1%. The self-and mutual-shielding of CO and H2 against UV\nphotodissociation is computed using the pre-calculated factors from Tables 10 and 11 in\nLee et al. (1996).\nThree other high-energy sources in the model that drive chemistry either through dissociation, ionization, or desorption are cosmic rays, decay of short-lived radionuclides, and\nstellar X-rays. The X-ray ionization rate in a given disk region is computed according to\nthe results of Glassgold et al. (1997a,b) with parameters for their high-metal depletion case.\nIn this model, the thermal \u223c 5 keV X-ray photons are generated at \u223c 0.1 AU above the\ncentral star, with a total X-ray luminosity of \u2248 1030 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Glassgold et al. 2005).\nThe cosmic-ray ionization rate is assumed to be 1.3\u00d710\u221217 s\u22121 . The ionization rate caused\nby radionuclide decay (primarily 26 Al and 60 Fe) is 6.5 \u00d7 10\u221219 s\u22121 (Finocchi & Gail 1997).\nWe adding the X-ray and radionuclide ionization rates to those involving cosmic ray particles\n(CRP) and CRP-induced UV photons.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nA modified static gas-grain chemical model that includes gas-grain interactions without\nsurface reactions and turbulent mixing has been utilized (Semenov et al. 2005). We allow\nonly surface formation of molecular hydrogen using the approach of Hollenbach & McKee\n(1979). This modification significantly decreases the numerical demands of our chemical\ncode and makes it computationally tractable while allows us to include all necessary physical\nprocesses. The gas-phase reaction rates and their uncertainties are taken from the recent\nRATE 06 database, in which the effects of dipole-enhanced ion-neutral rates are included\n(Woodall et al. 2007). To calculate photoreaction rates through the disk, we adopt precomputed fits of van Dishoeck (1988) instead of integrating the wavelength-dependent cross\nsections over the local UV spectrum (see van Zadelhoff et al. 2003).\nGas-grain interactions include the accretion of neutral molecules onto dust surfaces with\na sticking efficiency of 100%, dissociative recombination of ions on charged dust grains,\nand grain re-charging, as well as UV-, CRP-induced and thermal desorption of surface\nspecies. Desorption energies Edes are mostly taken from the recent osu.20072 database\n(Garrod & Herbst 2006) or roughly estimated by analogy for about 20 molecules.\nOverall, our network consists of positively and negatively as well as neutral dust grains,\n420 gas-phase and 157 surface species made of 13 elements, and 5773 reactions. Among\nthese 5773 reactions are 4517 gas-phase reactions, 2 charge exchange reactions for dust\ngrains, 940 dissociative recombination reactions of ions on charged and neutral grains, and\n314 accretion/desorption processes.\nAs initial abundances, we have adopted the so-called \"low metal\" set of Lee et al. (1998)\nas listed in Table 1 and assumed that all hydrogen is mostly locked in its molecular form.\nIn these initial abundances, the standard solar elemental composition is depleted in heavy\nelements by, e.g., 200 times for S up to more than 104 for Fe, Cl, P, and F. The mostly\natomic initial abundances are chosen instead of those from a molecular cloud model because\nthis choice allows the abundance uncertainties to accumulate in a long sequence of chemical\nreactions with imprecise rates, starting from basic processes that reach steady-state at early\ntimes during the disk evolution. Willacy et al. (1998) have shown that most of the molecular\nabundances are hardly affected by the choice of input abundances. Note also that the\nresulting abundance uncertainties can be sensitive to the initial elemental concentrations\n(Wakelam et al. 2006b). However, we do not allow the elemental concentrations to vary in\norder to keep the computations in reasonable limits.\n2\n\nhttps://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~eric/research.html\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n2.2.\n\nMethod to model rate uncertainties\n\nEach reaction rate coefficient in the RATE 06 database is given in the standard Arrhenius form and thus relies on 3 parameters: \u03b1 (the absolute value at room temperature),\n\u03b2 (the index for the power law dependence of the rate on temperature), and \u03b3 (the activation energy barrier in K). A specific expression for the reaction rate coefficient depends\non the type of chemical process: bimolecular reaction, direct cosmic-ray ionization reaction,\nphotodissociation, etc. Note that in all cases the rate coefficient scales linearly with the\nparameter \u03b1.\nIn addition to these three parameters, the RATE 06 reaction rates are characterized by\nan accuracy estimate (A, B, C, and D), where the uncertainties are smaller than 25%, 50%,\nwithin a factor of 2, and within an order of magnitude. Almost all reactions with measured\nrates belong to the first group (\u223c 1 400 reactions), while those reactions with rates that were\n\"guessed\" or derived by analogy are assigned to the third group (\u223c 2 800 reactions), which\ncontains most of the ion-neutral reaction rates. The second group includes about 300 mostly\nneutral-neutral and photodissociation reactions, whereas the fourth group consists of only 4\nphotodissociation reactions (Woodall et al. 2007).\nIn accord with the latest osu.2007 network, we adopted a rate uncertainty of one order\nof magnitude for radiative association reactions. Such a large uncertainty factor is justified\nby the difficulty in calculating or measuring these rate coefficients (e.g., Herbst 1985). The\nuncertainty factors vary widely for the photoreaction rates since the corresponding frequencydependent cross-sections have limited accuracy and have been obtained only for a fraction\nof molecules in the UMIST database (van Dishoeck 1988; van Dishoeck et al. 2006).\nOur method to model abundance uncertainties is based on the computation of a large\nset of chemical models, using identical physical and initial conditions and the same chemical\nnetwork, but with randomly varied rate coefficients within their uncertainty limits. We\nutilized the same method to introduce uncertainties in the rate coefficient values as described\nin Dobrijevic & Parisot (1998), Dobrijevic et al. (2003), and Wakelam et al. (2005). The rate\ncoefficient for each gas-phase reaction i is randomly chosen over a log-normal distribution\nwith median \u03b1i and dispersion Fi . Consequently, the rate coefficient of the i-th reaction\nspans an interval between \u03b1i /Fi and \u03b1i \u00d7 Fi with a probability of 68% (1\u03c3). We generated\na sequence of these log-normally distributed rates for all gas-phase reactions in our chemical\nnetwork using the following expression:\n\u03b1il = \u03b1i \u00d7 (Fi )\u01eb ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1il is the l-th realization of the i-th reaction rate, \u03b1i is the standard RATE 06 rate\nvalue for the i-th reaction, Fi is the dispersion, or the uncertainty factor, for this rate, and\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\u01eb is randomly distributed from -1 to 1 with an uniform distribution law.\nUsing this approach, we allowed the rates of only 4517 gas-phase reactions to vary in our\nnetwork. The rates of all other processes (gas-grain interactions, dissociative recombination\nof molecular ions on grains, and recharging of dust grains) were kept constant. Not did we\naccount for possible variations among the parameters of the disk physical model. Such an\nidealization allowed us to focus solely on an investigation of how uncertainties in gas-phase\nreactions affect the results of the disk chemical modeling.\nUsing 8 000 realizations of the RATE 06 network, we simulated 5 Myr of chemical evolution in the outer, r \u2265 50 AU, disk of DM Tau. The disk grid consists of 5 radial (50, 100,\n200, 380, and 760 AU) and 10 equidistant vertical points (with step sizes of 3.2, 7.6, 18,\n41.7, and 96 AU for the considered radii). Such a huge number of utilized chemical models\nwith randomly varied rates leads to low values of statistical noise in the distributions of the\nabundance scatters at any particular disk location, assuring the correctness of the sensitivity\nanalysis. Moreover, a large number of varied reaction rates allows an analysis of all reactions\nin the chemical network, in contrast to models with limited chemistry included in previous\nworks (e.g., Wakelam et al. 2005). Still, even with the modest 5 \u00d710 spatial resolution of the\nadopted disk model and without surface reactions, the overall computational time needed to\ncalculate the chemistry with these 8 000 networks was about 3 days on a 4-CPU PC machine\n(3.0 GHz Xeon, 8 Gb RAM).\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nAbundance distribution profiles\n\nBefore we perform a detailed analysis of the influence of the rate uncertainties on the\nmodeled molecular abundances, we investigate the abundance distribution profiles. Because\nwe utilized a log-normal distribution for the rate coefficients, one might expect that for each\nmolecule the abundance distribution should show a normal (Gaussian) profile in logarithmic\nscale. If this hypothesis is correct, one can use the dispersion \u2013 a measure of the scatter\nof randomly varied values that have a Gaussian distribution \u2013 as a convenient quantity\ncharacterizing the abundance and column density uncertainties.\nAs shown in Paper II, this assumption may not be fullfiled for certain species and\ncertain time steps. For example, when molecular abundances of a particular species show\na steep decline or increase with time then at that moment the corresponding histogram of\nthe abundance distribution can have several peaks and thus be far from a Gaussian shape\nbecause of sampling effects. Bimodal distributions can also be obtained if the system is\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nhighly sensitive to a small variation of specific parameter. Wakelam et al. (2006b) showed\nthat dense cloud chemistry hypersensitive, and even bistable, to the ratio between He and\nH2 cosmic-ray ionization rates in particular conditions. In this case our uncertainty method\nwould tend to overestimate the dispersion of the modeled abundances. The disk chemistry\nis very rich in a sense that it proceeds vastly differently in various disk regions and at\ndifferent times, so it is natural to expect that the abundance distributions of some species\ncan sometime deviate from a normal distribution.\nWe carefully studied this problem and found that such a situation happens rarely at\nlate times, & 1 Myr, for which our analysis will be performed. In Fig. 2 we show several\nrepresentative histograms of the abundance distributions at 5 Myr, using HCO+ and CO as\nan example. For an inner disk region, at r \u2248 97.5 AU, z \u2248 30 AU, a strong deviation from\nthe Gaussian shape is clearly visible, with 2 distinct peaks and a gap in between (Fig. 2, top\npanels). Note that this is one of the few exceptional cases that is discussed in detail below.\nEverywhere else through the disk the HCO+ and CO abundances have nearly Gaussian-like\nprofiles (Fig. 2, bottom panels). This condition holds for other key species as well, implying\nthat the averaged abundances in the disk should not differ from the values computed with the\nstandard RATE 06 network. Moreover, in Paper I we found that the Gaussian shape of the\nabundance distribution is also preserved for the uniform distribution of the rate uncertainties\nin linear scale.\nIn the rest of this paper, we will refer to one standard deviation (1\u03c3) in the modeled abundance distribution as the \"abundance uncertainty\". In our notation \"abundance\nscatter\" represents twice the abundance uncertainty in logarithmic scale (2 log \u03c3). It is the\nabundance uncertainties that have to be taken into account when interpreting the observational data with a chemical model.\n\n3.2.\n\nDistribution of the mean abundances in the disk\n\nAlthough the evolution of all species was calculated in 8 000 realizations of the chemical\nmodel, in what follows we focus on several key molecules that are used as tracers of disk\nphysical structure and chemical composition. Our list of important species includes molecules\nthat are widely used for kinematic studies and determination of the density and temperature\n(CO, CS, H2 CO, NH3 , and HCN) as well as for probing such major parameters as ionization\ndegree (HCO+ ), radiation fields (CN, HCN), and the yet-to-be detected C+ as a dominant ion\nin the disk surface (Dutrey et al. 1997; Kastner et al. 1997; Aikawa et al. 2003; Dutrey et al.\n2007).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nWe use time-dependent abundances to analyze the chemical evolution of these species\nin detail. The analysis is based on the calculation of the relative importance of each reaction\nin the chemical network for the abundance change of a molecule under investigation at a\ngiven time (Wiebe et al. 2003). This allows us to weight all reactions in the model and\nisolate a few most important pathways for chemical evolution of one or several species under\nspecific physical conditions. In the case of protoplanetary disks, such an analysis has to be\nperformed for several tens of representative cells.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the mean abundances of these molecules in the disk at 5 Myr, which\nare obtained by averaging the results of the chemical network. The vertical extension of the\n\u221a\ndisk is scaled by one hydrostatic scale height, H(r) = 2Cs /\u03a9, where Cs is the midplane\nsound speed and \u03a9 is the Keplerian frequency (Dartois et al. 2003). The unity pressure scale\nheight is about 25 and 320 AU at distances of 100 and 800 AU, respectively.\nThe \"sandwich\"-like chemical structure of the disk is clearly seen in Fig. 3. In the\n\"dark\", cold, and dense midplane at . 0.5 \u2212 1 pressure scale height, the molecules freeze\nout onto dust grains within 100 \u2212 100 000 yr and low steady-state fractional abundances of\n\u223c 10\u221214 \u2212 10\u221210 are reached. The abundances of the gas-phase species in the midplane at late\ntimes are sustained by the CRP-induced desorption of the mantle materials. The midplane\nabundance of CO \u223c 10\u22128, is higher because this molecule is very abundant (\u2248 10\u22124 ) in the\ngas phase initially, and since CO ice is rather volatile because of its low CO desorption barrier\nof \u223c 930 K (Bisschop et al. 2006). Overall, the gas-phase abundances in the midplane tend\nto slightly increase with radius as the disk surface density and thus the density in midplane\ndecrease and gas-grain interactions become less intense, which slows down the freeze-out of\ngas-phase molecules onto dust grain surfaces.\nThe surface layer of the disk (Z/H(r) & 2) is deficient in molecules due to strong irradiation by high-energy stellar and interstellar photons. Even CO, which is self-shielded and\nmutually-shielded by H2 against UV photodissociation cannot survive. Among the considered species, only C+ reaches its maximal concentration and becomes the most abundant ion\nin the surface layer, with an abundance of \u223c 10\u22124 . The thickness of this highly ionized layer\n(\u223c 1 pressure scale height down from the disk surface) stays nearly constant with radius for\nall key species but highly reactive radicals CS and CN, whose abundances are already high\n(\u223c 10\u22129 ) at scale pressure heights as high as Z/H(r) \u2248 2 at all radii (Fig. 3).\nIn contrast, polyatomic species tend to concentrate in the warm, chemically rich intermediate layer (. 1 \u2212 2 pressure scale height, depending on the radius). The model-averaged\nabundances for the considered species, \u223c 10\u221210 \u221210\u22124 , are close to the values computed with\nthe standard RATE 06 network and those found in previous work (Aikawa & Herbst 1999;\nWillacy & Langer 2000; Aikawa et al. 2002; Willacy et al. 2006; Dutrey et al. 2007).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nNow let us consider the chemical processes that form and destroy the considered species\nin the intermediate layer. In contrast to dense cloud models, for many species in this disk\nzone steady-state is reached by \u223c 103 \u2212105 yr. This is due to the higher densities encountered\nin the warm layer (& 106 \u2212 108 cm\u22123 ) than in the cloud cores (\u223c 104 \u2212 106 cm\u22123 ) and a nonnegligible flux of the UV radiation. Impinging interstellar UV photons allow many surface\nspecies to desorb back into the gas phase (Hasegawa & Herbst 1993; Garrod & Herbst 2006),\nthus reducing their surface abundances and overall importance of gas-grain interactions for\ndisk chemical evolution at late times, t & 10 000 yr.\nThe evolution of CO and HCO+ in the intermediate layer is governed by a small set of\nreactions at all radii. The CO molecules are formed via reactions of atomic oxygen with CH,\nCH2 , and C2 at t . 1 000 yr, and partly through the dissociative recombination of HCO+\nafterwards (at this stage steady-state has been reached and there is a loop between CO\nand its protonated form). The light hydrocarbons that are precursors of CO are themselves\nrapidly created within a few years via the radiative association of C with H and H2 , and\nCH with H2 . The CO is mainly removed from the gas phase by accretion onto the dust\ngrain surfaces in outer, cold regions and by reactive collisions with helium ions in the inner,\nX-ray ionized part of the intermediate layer. In the upper part of this layer, CO is also\nphotodissociated. The ion HCO+ initially forms via reactions of O with CH and ionized\n+\nlight hydrocarbons, CH+\nn (n=1\u20133), and the ion-neutral reaction between CO and CH5 (also\nproducing methane). At a later time of & 1 000 yr, HCO+ becomes the most abundant\nion in the intermediate layer and the dominant molecular ion in the disk, with a fractional\nabundance of \u223c 10\u22129 . At this steady-state stage, HCO+ is mainly produced via reactive\ncollisions between CO and H+\n3 and destroyed by dissociative recombination with electrons\nand negatively charged grains.\nThe chemically related H2 CO molecule is produced through reaction of CH3 with oxygen atoms. At a later time of \u223c 105 yr H2 CO is involved in a simple formation-destruction\ncycle. It starts with protonation of formaldehyde by HCO+ , H3 O+ , and H+\n3 , which is followed by dissociative recombination into H2 CO (33%), CO (33%), or HCO (33%). Apart\nfrom photodissociation and freeze out, another direct destruction channel for H2 CO in the\nupper, more ionized part of the intermediate layer is the ion-neutral reaction with C+ , which\n+\n+\nproduces either CO and CH+\n2 , HCO and CH, or H2 CO and C. The chemical evolution of\nformaldehyde typically reaches steady-state at about 105 yr with a gas-phase abundance of\n. 3 \u00d7 10\u221210 . Note that in the same disk chemical model as discussed above but with a set\nof surface reactions taken from Garrod & Herbst (2006) the overall (gas-phase and surface)\nabundance of formaldehyde is decreased by a factor of several as it is converted to methanol\nby hydrogenation on grain surfaces.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nThe photostable radical CN is abundant (10\u22128 ) at an upper, less molecularly rich disk\nlayer (Z/H(r) \u2248 1.8, Fig. 3). The initial formation channel for the cyanogen radical is\nthe radiative association between C and N, followed by the neutral-neutral reaction of N\nand CH, and dissociative recombination of HCNH+ at later times (t & 104 yr). Other, less\nimportant formation pathways for CN at this stage are neutral-neutral reactions between C\nand NO producing CN and O as well as between C and OCN leading to CN and CO. The\ndestruction of CN mostly proceeds through photodissociation and neutral-neutral reaction\nwith N forming highly photostable nitrogen molecules and C.\nIn turn, HCNH+ is produced by ion-neutral reactions between H2 and HCN+ and be3\ntween N and Cn H+\n2 (n = 3, 4) at early times (t . 10 yr). Later the steady-state recycling of\nHCNH+ is reached, which involves dissociative recombination of HCNH+ into either HCN\n(33%), HNC (33%), or CN (33%), followed by re-production of HCNH+ via protonation of\n+\n+\nHCN and HNC by either H+\n3 , H3 O , or HCO as well as via the ion-neutral reaction of CN\nwith H+\n3.\nThe chemistry of HCN is tightly related to the evolution of CN and HCNH+ . HCN is\nmainly produced by neutral-neutral reactions involving nitrogen and methylene or methyl\nat early evolutionary stages, t . 104 yr. Later the evolution of HCN proceeds as a part of\nthe HCNH+ formation-destruction loop. The major destruction routes for gas-phase HCN\ninclude freeze-out onto dust grains and the ion-neutral reaction with C+ , which forms CNC+\nand H. Another important destruction channel for HCN in the upper disk layers at \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2\nscale heights is photodissociation. Steady-state for HCN is typically reached within & 104 yr,\nwith an abundance of about a few \u00d710\u221210 .\nThe layer where abundant ammonia exists is located somewhat deeper toward the disk\nmidplane compared with HCN and especially CN because NH3 can be photodissociated by\nUV photons shortward of \u2248 1 950 \u00c5(van Dishoeck 1988). The main formation route for\nammonia is dissociative recombination of NH+\n4 , which itself is formed through a sequence of\nhydrogen insertion reactions starting with the production of the NH+ ions from N+ reacting\nwith H2 . Upon formation, NH+ repeatedly reacts with molecular hydrogen and gains an\naddition hydrogen atom until NH+\n4 is formed. The destruction of ammonia proceeds mainly\n+\nvia ion-neutral reactions with C and S+ in the upper intermediate layer as well as H+\n3,\n+\n+\n+\nH3 O , and HCO in a deeper region, which leads again to NH4 and either H2 , H2 O, or CO.\nFor all radii, the abundance of ammonia reaches a steady-state value of . 3 \u00d7 10\u221210 \u2212 10\u22129\nat very late times of & 105 \u2212 106 yr.\nThe chemical evolution of CS is governed by neutral-neutral reactions between sulphur\natoms and either CH, CH2 , or C2 initially, and later, at t & 103 yr, by an extended formationdestruction cycle of Hn CS+ (n=1\u20133) and HC2 S+ . At this evolutionary stage these complex\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n+\nions are produced by ion-neutral reactions of protonated water, H+\n3 , and HCO with Hn CS\n(n=0\u20132). The initial routes to form the HCS+ ion are the reactions between CH+\n3 and S or\n+\n+\n+\nCS and H2 , whereas HC2 S forms predominantly via reaction of CH3 and S . The H3 CS+\nion is mostly produced in reactive collisions of methane with sulphur ions. Upon formation,\nHCS+ dissociatively recombines into CS (\u223c 10%) or CH (\u223c 90%), while HC2 S+ breaks up\nequally into C2 S or CS. The H2 CS+ and H3 CS+ ions recombine with equal probabilities into\nCS and either HCS or H2 CS. Finally, the major destruction channels for CS are photodissociation and the ion-neutral reaction with C+ . The steady-state abundance for CS, \u223c 10\u22129 ,\nis usually attained at about 103 \u2212 105 yr in our model.\n\n3.3.\n\nDistribution of the abundance and column density uncertainties\n\nFor each key molecule, we derived the distribution of abundance uncertainties (dispersion) in the disk. The results are shown in Fig. 4. These uncertainties are quite different\nin different disk regions. Note that the overall abundance uncertainties are not much larger\nfor the more complex (heavy) species among considered, in comparison to those with fewer\natoms (e.g., compare C+ , CO, HCO+ , and H2 CO). However, if we would focus on even more\ncomplex species (e.g., consisting of > 7 atoms), the abundance uncertainties will in general\nincrease with the number of atoms in the molecule, as shown by Vasyunin et al. (2004) and\nWakelam et al. (2006a).\nAmong the key reactions, the rates of photodissociation and photoionization processes\ncan be uncertain by factors of 2 and larger. Moreover, their absolute values depend on the\ndetails of the UV radiative transfer modeling (van Zadelhoff et al. 2003). Thus, it is not\nsurprising that in the disk atmosphere at Z/H(r) & 1.5 \u2212 2 large abundance uncertainties\nwith a factor of . 10\u221230 are reached for most of the species, in particular across the interface\nbetween the intermediate layer and the disk atmosphere. A notable exception is ionized\ncarbon, because it contains essentially all of the element carbon in the disk atmosphere and\nthus maintains a high steady-state abundance that is not affected by chemistry. This effect\nleads to relatively low values of the C+ abundance uncertainties, in particular a factor of . 3.\nThe same is true for CO, which locks up all carbon in the disk midplane and intermediate\nlayer at . 2 pressure scale height and here has its lowest abundance uncertainty, a factor of\n. 2 (Fig. 4).\nThere is a disk region adjacent to the midplane at r \u223c 100 AU, Z/H(r) \u223c 1, where\nthe abundance uncertainties of the considered carbon-bearing species including CO show\nan increase of up to one order of magnitude (see HCO+ , Fig. 4). There, the chemistry of\nCO and hence all chemically related species (e.g., HCO+ , H2 CO, etc.) are prone to the\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nhypersensitivity at & 106 yr caused by the rate uncertainty of the X-ray ionization of helium\natoms, as discussed in Wakelam et al. (2006b). This region is moderately warm, with a\ntemperature T \u223c 25 \u2212 40 K, and well shielded from the UV radiation from the central star\nand the interstellar UV radiation (AV . 2 \u2212 5 mag). The thermal bremsstrahlung X-ray\nphotons (\u223c 5 keV) generated at \u223c 0.1 AU above the star, however, are able to penetrate into\nthis region (Glassgold et al. 1997a), with a total ionization rate of \u223c 10\u221216 s\u22121 . These X-ray\nphotons produce helium ions that rapidly react and destroy the CO molecules (forming O\nand C+ ). In turn, these C+ ions are used to reform CO but also to slowly produce carbon\nchain molecules (e.g., C2 H2 ) and cyanopolyynes (e.g., HC3 N), which are removed from the\ngas phase by freeze out onto the dust surfaces. These heavy surface molecules lock up most\nof the elemental carbon at t & 1 Myr such that the gas-phase abundance of CO is reduced\nto \u223c 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22127 . The overall efficiency of the carbon chain formation and the decline of the\nCO abundance at late times sensitively depend on the He ionization rate. Consequently, the\nCO histogram of the abundance distribution at 5 Myr has a double-peaked, non-Gaussian\nshape, as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe abundances of nitrogen-bearing species such as CN, HCN, and NH3 in the region\naround the midplane at r > 200 AU (Fig. 4) possesses a high sensitivity to the rate of the\nCRP ionization of He. The histograms of CN, HCN, and NH3 are not fully Gaussian at 5 Myr\nin this region, and our method tends to overestimate the resulting abundance uncertainties.\nThis region is so cold that at late times, t & 3 \u00d7 105 yr, most molecules are removed from\n+\nthe gas phase by freeze-out. At this evolutionary stage, H+\n3 and later H become the most\nabundant charged species. The primal formation pathway for H+ is the slow ion-neutral\nreaction between He+ and H2 . The rise of the H+ abundance at \u223c 5 Myr(. 10\u22128 ) occurs\nin part because of the slowness of the radiative recombination of ionized hydrogen atoms\nin the molecular-deficient gas. The total electron concentration increases in tandem with\nH+ , and leads to more rapid dissociative recombination of HCNH+ and NH+\n4 (precursor ions\nfor CN, HCN, and NH3 ). Consequently, the previously low gas-phase abundances of these\nnitrogen-bearing molecules increase at t \u223c 5 Myr by factors of several. The steepness and\nevolutionary pattern for these abundance gradients depend sensitively on the abundance of\nhelium ions.\nIn the rest of the intermediate layer, the chemical evolution of the gas-phase species is\ninitiated by radiative association reactions with high uncertainties but governed later by ionneutral and neutral-neutral reactions with many accurately estimated rates. The situation\nin the disk midplane is similar, though at later times the chemical evolution of many gasphase species is governed by the steady-state accretion-desorption life-cycle, which has no\nuncertainties in our model. This effect leads to lower abundance uncertainties of a factor of\n\u223c 3 than occur in the upper disk region (see Fig. 4).\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nIt is interesting to note that for CO, C+ , and NH3 the uncertainty peak does not coincide\nwith the maximal relative abundance in the disk. One might expect that the scatter in their\ncolumn densities could be smaller than for other considered species (CS, CN, HCN, HCO+ ,\nand H2 CO), for which uncertainty peaks and maximum abundances tend to coincide.\nIn Fig. 5, the radial distributions of the column densities at 5 Myr are plotted for\nthe considered species (dotted lines). In addition, in Table 2 we compile typical intrinsic\nuncertainties of the column densities of a larger set of key molecules in protoplanetary disks\nat 100 AU. Indeed, the overall uncertainty in the column densities of CO, C+ , and NH3 as\n+\n+\nwell as H+\n3 , H2 O, N2 H , and HCNH is less than a factor of about 2. Using this uncertainty\nvalue as a criterion, we assign these species to the so-called first uncertainty group. On the\nother hand, the column densities of CS, CN, HCN, HCO+ , and H2 CO as well as CO2 , C2 H,\nand HNC have larger error bars up to a factor of 4. These species belong to the second\nuncertainty group. It is likely that the species from the first sensitivity group are more\nreliable observational tracers than the species from the second one.\nNote that the column density uncertainties do not exceed a factor of about 4 even for\nformaldehyde and are comparable with observational uncertainties. However, for heavier\nspecies (e.g., HC9 N), which are not included in our study, the uncertainties are likely larger,\nas shown in Paper I and Paper II. In our model, these uncertainties slowly increase with time\nand typically reach steady-state at & 105 yr. The column density uncertainties can be used as\nerror bars of the theoretically predicted quantities when comparing with observational data.\nMoreover, one can envisage a situation when, for an object with a well-studied structure,\nhigh-resolution observations followed by advanced modeling will allow putting such tight\nconstraints on molecular abundances or column densities that it may help to determine the\nrate coefficients of some key reactions observationally.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the previous section, we demonstrated how and to what extent the uncertainties of the\nrate coefficients affect the computed abundances and column densities of several key species\nin the disk. In this section, we discuss the relative contributions of individual reactions to\nthe uncertainties of these key molecules.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n4.1.\n\nSensitivity analysis method\n\nThe chemical evolution of even a simple molecule usually involves a large number of\nreactions in the adopted chemical network. The non-linearity of the equations of chemical\nkinetics often makes it a challenge to find a direct link between the rate value of a certain\nreaction and the molecular abundances. Thus an efficient numerical method is required (see,\ne.g., Turanyi 1997).\nUsing a sensitivity analysis based on a simple correlation method, we have shown in\nPaper I that under the physical conditions of dark and diffuse clouds the rate uncertainties\nof only a handful of chemical reactions affect the accuracy of the resulting abundances to the\nhighest extent. For the disk chemistry studied in this paper a modified, two-stage sensitivity\nanalysis was performed.\nFirst, for each selected molecule, we calculated time-dependent linear correlation coefficients between the abundances and rate coefficients for all 8 000 realizations of the RATE 06\nnetwork, and 19 logarithmically taken time steps over the 5 Myr of disk evolution at each\ndisk cell. The coefficients Rij (t) are given by the expression\nP l\n(xi (r, z, t) \u2212 xi (r, z, t))(\u03b1jl \u2212 \u03b1j )\nRij (r, z, t) = qP l\n,\n(2)\n2P\n2\nl\nl\nl (\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1j )\nl (xi (r, z, t) \u2212 xi (r, z, t))\nwhere xli (r, z, t) is the molecular abundance of the i-th species computed with the l-th realization of the UMIST network, xi (r, z, t) is the standard (mean) abundance of this species,\n\u03b1jl is the j-th reaction rate coefficient for the l-th realization of the RATE 06 network, and\n\u03b1j is the standard rate coefficient of the j-th reaction.\nThis is in contrast to Paper I where the analysis of statistically significant reactions was\nperformed for only the final time step. Since at various evolutionary stages the chemistry of a\nmolecule is typically governed by a restricted number of chemical processes, at any particular\ntime step the abundance correlation will be high only for some of the key reactions, as shown\nin Fig. 5 for the case of ammonia. The obvious drawback of such a \"single-time\" approach\nis that it does not account for the cumulative character of the abundance uncertainties.\nTherefore, we integrated the absolute values of time-dependent correlation coefficients over\nthe entire evolutionary time of 5 Myr. These quantities are called \"cumulative correlation\ncoefficients\".\nWith this cumulative criterion, one can identify those reactions whose rate uncertainties\nare the most important for the abundance scatter of one molecule in one specific disk region.\nAs a general criterion for the entire disk, we utilized the cumulative correlation summed up\nover all 50 disk grid cells, followed by summation over the 8 considered species (CO, C+ , CS,\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nHCO+ , H2 CO, CN, HCN, NH3 ). One should bear in mind that the results of our analysis\nrely on the inherent assumption that the absolute values of the rate coefficients and their\nuncertainties in RATE 06 are accurately determined. This assumption may not be fullfiled\nfor all important reactions in the RATE 06 database as we will show below. Such reactions\nwill not be treated correctly by our sensitivity analysis.\n\n4.2.\n\nIdentification of the most problematic reactions\n\nWe calculated disk-averaged cumulative correlations for all 5773 reactions in our chemical network and for 8 key species: CO, C+ , CS, HCO+ , H2 CO, CN, HCN, and NH3 . The\ncorresponding cumulative correlations, normalized in descending order, steadily decline with\nthe number of reaction. The 56 most \"problematic\" reactions and their weights for these 8\nmolecules are listed in Table 3. We term by \"weight\" the corresponding cumulative correlations summed over the all 50 disk cells and renormalized to the maximum value of 1148.1,\nwhich is achieved for the RA reaction between H2 and C.\nThese 56 reactions correspond to 1% of the total number of reactions in our chemical model. Moreover, such an apparently small number of reactions is chosen to stimulate\nexperimental and theoretical studies of the rate coefficients of the reactions with high astrochemical importance. Note also that some of the most \"problematic\" reactions in Table 3\nhave been carefully studied as their rates have small uncertainties of only factors of 1.25\u20131.5.\nIn order to demonstrate that these 56 reactions are indeed important and their rate\nuncertainties strongly affect the abundances, we re-calculated the disk chemical evolution\nbut allowed the rates of these 56 reactions to vary by only a factor of 1.25 (and 2 for radiative\nassociation). Such idealization is thought to mimic the situation when all of these 56 rates\nwill be accurately measured in the laboratory or derived theoretically.\nThe resulting uncertainties in the molecular column densities are shown in Fig. 5 (solid\nlines) and reported in Table 3 (last column). Compared with the initial column density\nuncertainties, the refined chemical model leads to smaller error bars for most of the considered\nmolecules, in particular for CO, HCO+ , H2 CO, CN, and H2 O. However, the improvement is\nnot so obvious for nitrogen-bearing species (HCN, HNC, NH3 , HCNH+ ) as well as CO2 , CS,\nand C2 H. Their chemical evolution is governed by a large set of key reactions that are only\npartly included in the list of the 56 most problematic reactions (Table 2)3 .\nThe fact that the uncertainties in column densities decrease not only for the 8 key species,\n3\n\nAn extended version of this table is freely available from the authors upon request.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nbut also for some other molecules in Table 2 clearly indicates that some of the reactions from\nTable 3 are relevant for their chemical evolution. For H+\n3 these are the ionization of H2 and\n+\nreactions of H3 with C, O, and CO. As we have shown in Sect. 3.1, reactions with H+\n3 are an\nessential ingredient of disk chemistry. The decrease in the abundance error bars for H+\n3 in the\nmodel with refined rate uncertainties leads to smaller abundance uncertainties in the related\nspecies: HCO+ , H2 CO, H2 O, HCN, HNC, HCNH+ , and CS. Table 3 contains a number of\nreactions important for the evolution of CO and CO2 ; e.g., formation of light hydrocarbons,\nneutral-neutral reactions of these hydrocarbons with oxygen, and CO photodissociation. The\nformer reactions affect the evolution of C2 H, while photodissociation is an important process\nfor CN.\nBelow we discuss the contributions of each reaction type in detail.\n\n4.2.1. Radiative association\nThe most problematic reactions in the disk are radiative association (RA) reactions.\nRadiative association leads to the formation of a larger molecule from two smaller species\nupon their collision, and requires the emission of excess energy in the form of a photon.\nRA reactions allow the formation of new bonds and more chemically \"advanced\" species\n(van Dishoeck & Blake 1998). The corresponding rate values are often so low for small\nspecies that they are difficult to obtain with high accuracy (Williams 1972; Herbst 1980;\nBates & Herbst 1988; Smith 1989). Nonetheless, assigned uncertainties for many of these\nreactions in RATE 06 are only a factor of 2 and less. Since we assume that the rate coefficients of such reactions may vary by an order of magnitude, in accord with the recent\nOSU database, it is not surprising that some RA reactions are identified as among the most\nproblematic reactions for disk chemistry. Its importance is also rise due to the fact that we\nstart calculation from the atomic initial abundances and use time-integrated correlation coefficients. It means that at early evolutionary time chemistry is dominated by RA reactions\nand, therefore, its time-integrated correlation coefficients increase greatly at early times.\nTwo RA reactions are particularly important for the chemical evolution and accumulation of the abundance uncertainties. First is the reaction between H2 and C, which produces CH2 everywhere through the disk at all times. The rate coefficient of this reaction\nis not well known, with with an estimated value of 10\u221217 cm3 s\u22121 at T = 10 \u2212 300 K\n(Prasad & Huntress 1980; Woodall et al. 2007). This reaction is relevant for the evolution\nof CO, HCO+ , H2 CO, CS, and HCN. Second, the reaction between H2 and C+ leads to the\n+\n+\nformation of CH+\n2 (important for C , HCO , CS, NH3 , and CN), with an estimated rate\ncoefficient of \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u221217 cm3 s\u22121 (Herbst 1985). These two reactions initiate processes of\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nC and H addition in the chemical model and thus should be relevant for nearly all species\ncontaining carbon and hydrogen.\nThe next most important RA reaction (8th place out of 56) is the formation of pro\u221214\ntonated methane from molecular hydrogen and CH+\ncm3 s\u22121 , \u03b2 = \u22121;\n3 (\u03b1 = 1.3 \u00d7 10\nSmith 1989), which is an important molecular ion for CO destruction. More recently the\nrate of this reaction has been measured at low temperature of 10 K by Gerlich (1995),\n1.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 for para-H2 .\nMuch less important (27th and 28th place) are two slow reactions between C and H or\nN producing CH or CN radicals. It is interesting to note that the latter reaction has different\nrate coefficients in the OSU and RATE 06 databases (Smith et al. 2004; Woodall et al. 2007).\nWhile in osu.2007 this reaction rate has no temperature dependence and no activation barrier\n(\u03b1 = 10\u221217 cm3 s\u22121 ; Prasad & Huntress 1980), in RATE 06 the corresponding rate is low,\n7.9 \u00d7 10\u221219 cm3 s\u22121 , and possesses a small barrier of 96 K (relevant temperature range is\nbetween 300 and 2 700 K; Singh & Andreazza 2000). Thus the RATE 06 and osu.2007 rate\ncoefficients for the RA reaction between C and N differ by an order of magnitude in a wide\ntemperature range.\nThe situation is similar for the RA reaction between molecular hydrogen and CH that\nforms CH3 \u2013 an important radical for the evolution of formaldehyde. The corresponding\nosu.2007 rate at 10 K is 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm3 s\u22121 (\u03b1 = 3.25 \u00d7 10\u221217 cm3 s\u22121 , \u03b2 = \u22120.6). In\ncontrast, in RATE 06 this reaction has a small barrier of 11.6 K and the 10 K rate value is\nlower by an order of magnitude, 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221217 cm3 s\u22121 (\u03b1 = 5.09 \u00d7 10\u221218 cm3 s\u22121 , \u03b2 = \u22120.71,\nand \u03b3 = 11.6 K; Brownsword et al. 1997).\nIn addition to radiative association, we list radiative recombination reactions of C+ and\nCH+\n3 in the same group in Table 3. The radiative recombination of ionized carbon is a key reaction for the evolution of C+ . Its rate coefficient at room temperature is 4.67\u00d710\u221212 cm3 s\u22121\nwith an inverse temperature exponent of 0.6 (Woodall et al. 2007). The assumed uncertainty\nof this rate (the factor of 10) in osu.2007 is in contrast to the results of Nahar & Pradhan\n(1997), who have theoretically predicted this rate value and found that the corresponding\nuncertainty is only \u223c 10%. In the RATE 06 database the uncertainty of this rate constant\nis set to 50%.\nFinally, the radiative recombination of CH+\n3 is the least probable channel in the reactive\ncollisions between methyl ions and electrons. The rate of this process is estimated to be\nmuch higher than for other recombination reactions involving atomic species, particularly in\ncold regions, and might be accurately determined in laboratory (\u03b1 = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 ,\n\u03b2 = \u22120.5; Millar et al. 1997; Le Teuff et al. 2000; Woodall et al. 2007). In the osu.2007\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\ndatabase, this rate has a steeper dependence on temperature, \u03b2 = \u22120.7 (Smith et al. 2004).\nWe conclude that RA reactions require a particular attention because their rate uncertainties are often large and not well known so that the modeling results can be heavily\naffected.\n\n4.2.2. Cosmic ray ionization\nThe next most important reactions that contribute strongly to the resulting abundance\nscatter of many molecules are the cosmic ray ionization of molecular hydrogen and helium\natoms. The cosmic ray particles able to penetrate deeply into the disk are mostly high-energy\nprotons (E & 100 Mev) and heavy nuclei (e.g. iron, E \u223c 1 Gev) (Dalgarno & McCray 1972;\nLeger et al. 1985; Dolginov & Stepinski 1994). Direct ionization initiate chemical evolution in dark and cold regions where cosmic ray particles remain the main ionization source\n(Herbst & Klemperer 1973). In the disk this is the outer midplane at r & 30 AU and the\nlower part of the intermediate layer (Gammie 1996; Semenov et al. 2004). Moreover, since\nwe added the X-ray ionization rate to the CRP rate value in an attempt to crudely treat the\neffect of high-energy stellar radiation, it is not surprising that high correlation coefficients\nfor some CRP-ionization reactions are reached in the disk atmosphere and intermediate\nlayer at r . 100 AU for several key species such as CO (see Fig. 4). A more accurate\napproach to model X-ray chemistry in disks is required (Neufeld et al. 1994; Maloney et al.\n1996; Lepp & Dalgarno 1996; St\u00e4uber et al. 2005).\nIt is natural that because the cosmic ray ionization of H2 and He is the primal chemical\nprocess, it is also the key factor for the accumulation of abundance scatters. In the RATE 06\ndatabase the corresponding rate coefficients are estimated to be accurate within a factor of\n2 (Woodall et al. 2007). However, this rate uncertainty has two origins.\nFirst, there is the physical uncertainty that is related to our limited knowledge of the\nabsolute CRP flux and its penetrating ability, which may vary in different astrophysical\nobjects (Spitzer & Tomasko 1968; Dolginov & Stepinski 1994; Caselli et al. 1998). While the\ndirect ionization process driven by CRPs is well studied and the corresponding cross sections\nand rates are well known (Solomon & Werner 1971), the second chemical uncertainty resides\nin the treatment of the ionization by energetic secondary electrons (Glassgold & Langer\n1973). Here the elemental composition of the gas plays a decisive role (Ilgner & Nelson\n2006).\nThe CRP-induced ionization rate of H2 currently used in all UMIST and OSU databases\nwas taken from the PhD thesis of Black (1975). It was computed for a mixture of atomic\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nand molecular hydrogen but new calculations for a mixture of hydrogen and helium would\nbe required in order to have a more consistent rate value (see discussion in Wakelam et al.\n2006b). Other CRP-ionization reactions listed in Table 3 do not have a reference in the\nRATE 06 database so it is hard to judge how accurate their rates are.\nApparently, the rate uncertainty of the CRP-driven reactions can be partially eliminated\nby more accurate modeling of the full cascade of ionizing events, but the physical uncertainty\nwill still remain, which needs more efforts from observers. Wakelam et al. (2006b) have\ndemonstrated how crucial this may be for the results of pure gas-phase chemical models of\nstatic molecular clouds.\n\n4.2.3. Photoreactions\nAnother set of chemical processes with problematic rates are photodissociation (PD) and\nphotoionization (PI) reactions, as listed in Table 3. These reactions are important in those\nregions where UV photons are either able to penetrate (the disk atmosphere and intermediate\nlayer) or are induced by cosmic ray particles (disk midplane; Prasad & Tarafdar 1983). Highenergy UV photons destroy or ionize gas-phase molecules and allow surface species to desorb\nback into the gas phase.\nWhile both the PD and PI cross sections for many species can be measured or calculated with a rather good accuracy of . 50% (van Dishoeck 1988; van Dishoeck et al. 2006),\nthe major difficulty in obtaining accurate photorates is our limited knowledge of the UV\nradiation field inside protoplanetary disks.\ncitetBea03 and van Dishoeck et al. (2006) have shown that many T Tauri stars emit strong,\nnon-blackbody UV radiation. Their spectra resemble that of the interstellar (IS) UV radiation field, with a large fraction of the UV flux emitted in the Ly\u03b1 line. van Zadelhoff et al.\n(2003) have demonstrated the importance of scattering for the UV penetration deep into\nthe disk interior. Furthermore, for the two most abundant molecules, H2 and CO, that effectively dissociate through partly overlapping lines shortward of about 1 120 \u00c5, the optical\nthickness in these lines can become so high that self- and mutual-shielding have to be taken\ninto account (Dalgarno & Stephens 1970; van Dishoeck 1988; Lee et al. 1996; Jonkheid et al.\n2006).\nIn the UMIST and OSU databases, the photorates have mostly been adopted from the\ncompilation of van Dishoeck (1988) and Roberge et al. (1991), where they have been computed using a simple plane-parallel approach and the IS (IS) UV radiation field of Draine\n(1978). The IS UV flux is characteristic of a diluted radiation field from an early B star\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n(Teff \u223c 30 000 K) located at a distance of \u223c 10 pc, with a cut-off at 912 \u00c5 due to absorption\nby interstellar atomic hydrogen (Spitzer 1978; van Dishoeck 1994). Obviously, it is not representative of the UV radiation from much cooler Herbig Ae and T Tauri stars surrounded by\ncircumstellar disks. Recently, van Dishoeck et al. (2006) have recalculated the corresponding PD and PI rates, using more appropriate UV spectral distributions typical of Herbig Ae,\nT Tauri, and Sun-like stars.\nThe 10 problematic photodissociation and photoionization reactions found by the sensitivity analysis are involved in either the formation of key species (C+ and CN), their\ndestruction (CO, CN, CS, NH3 , and HCN), or the destruction of parental molecules (OH,\nCH, and CH2 ). Their rates in the RATE 06 database are in general inaccurate by a factor of\n2 with some exceptions. The photodissociation of CO proceeds indirectly, through predissociation, and depends on the amount of molecular hydrogen and CO molecules in the line\nof sight to the source of UV radiation (van Dishoeck 1987), and thus has a rate uncertainty\nof a factor of 10 (see Table 3). In contrast, the rates of direct photodissociation of NH3 ,\nOH, and HCN are inaccurate by the factor of 1.5 only (Roberge et al. 1991). Despite such\nsmall error bars, the latter three reactions were identified as problematic reactions for disk\nchemistry.\n\n4.2.4. Ion-neutral and neutral-neutral reactions\nIon-neutral (IN) and neutral-neutral (NN) reactions form the largest fraction of the\nproblematic reactions (32 out of 56) for disk chemistry, but their individual importance is\nnot as significant as for CRI and RA reactions (Table 3).\nIon-neutral reactions are usually exothermic and rapid, and lead to the formation of\nnew species by bond rearrangement. Their rate coefficients can often be obtained by simple\nLangevin theory, which relates the isotropic polarizability of the species and its reduced\nmass (Clary 1988). For molecules that possess a large dipole moment, the rate values can be\nsignificantly enhanced at low temperature by the long-distance Coulomb attraction between\nthe positive ion and negatively charged side of the molecule (Adams et al. 1985; Clary 1985).\nMoreover, many neutral-neutral reactions with small barriers or without a barrier can also be\nfast under interstellar conditions. The rates of most radical-radical reactions and even some\nradical-stable neutral reactions are controlled by long-range attractive forces and thus do not\nget smaller at low temperatures (see, e.g., Smith 1988; Sims et al. 1993, 1994b; Canosa et al.\n1997). The typical rate coefficient for these reactions is about an order of magnitude lower\nthan for ion-neutral processes. The rates of some of the fast neutral-neutral reactions at\nlow temperatures have been measured in the laboratory and predicted theoretically (e.g.,\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nClary et al. 1994; Sims et al. 1994a; Chastaing et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2004).\nIn RATE 06, most of the IN and NN rate coefficients are uncertain by a factor of 2\nand less, up to the accuracy of 25% (Table 3). However, a major ambiguity that resides\nin the IN rate constants is the treatment of their temperature dependence. In two versions\nof the RATE 06 database the rate value for the reaction involving a polar molecule and\na molecular ion can have a negative dependence on temperature (\u03b2 = \u22120.5; adopted in\nthis work) or no temperature dependence (\u03b2 = 0), while its rate coefficient fits the value\nat room temperature. In contrast, in the OSU network the corresponding IN rates based\non low temperature theoretical estimations to be most accurate at \u223c 10 K even though\nthe listed reaction rate coefficients are scaled with respect to 300 K with \u03b2 \u223c \u22120.5. Two\nproblematic reactions involving a polar molecule and an ion with significantly different rates\nin RATE 06 and osu.2007 are those between C+ and NH, forming CN+ and H (\u03b1osu.2007 =\n4.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm3 s\u22121 vs. \u03b1RATE 06 = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 ) and between S+ and CH, producing\nCS+ and H (\u03b1osu.2007 = 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm3 s\u22121 vs \u03b1RATE 06 = 6.2 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 ).\nOther IN reactions with different rates in the RATE 06 and osu.2007 databases are\nreactions involving an atom and a molecular ion. The break up of molecular hydrogen upon\ncollision with helium ion involves a small barrier of 35 K and \u03b1 = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm3 s\u22121 in\nRATE 06 (the relevant temperature range is between 10K and 300K; Woodall et al. 2007),\nwhile in osu.2007 the same rate coefficient is about 5 times smaller and has no barrier\n(Smith et al. 2004). However, this results in difference of the osu.2007 and RATE 06 rate\nvalues of an order of magnitude at most.\nSimilarly, the OSU reaction between molecular hydrogen and ionized ammonia produces\nhydrogen atom and protonated ammonia with a rate coefficient of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm3 s\u22121 and\na steep temperature dependence (\u03b2 = \u22121.5). In RATE 06 this reaction has a non-Langevin\nrate with \u03b2 = 0. At temperatures below 20 K its rate coefficient is twice as large, \u03b1 = 3.36 \u00d7\n10\u221214 cm3 s\u22121 , and a negative activation barrier of -35.7 K exists (Adams & Smith 1984). At\ntemperatures between 20 and 300 K this reaction has no barrier and \u03b1 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 .\nFor temperatures above 300 K the rate coefficient is 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm3 s\u22121 and a barrier is\nabout 1 000 K (Fehsenfeld et al. 1975). Consequently, the osu.2007 and RATE 06 rate values\ncan differ by up to one order of magnitude.\n+\nFinally, the IN reaction between H+\n3 and O produces only OH and H2 in OSU, but in\nRATE 06 a second, less probable alternative channel that leads to the production of ionized\nwater and atomic hydrogen is given (Milligan & McEwan 2000).\n\nNote that the 4 IN reactions with the smallest rate uncertainty of 25% are still problematic for disk chemistry. Such high sensitivity of the disk modeling results to the rates\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nof these reactions is caused by their importance for the evolution of CO, HCO+ , and HCN.\nThe most important one is the IN reaction between helium ions and CO, which leads to\nthe hypersensitivity of the final abundances of many carbon-bearing species in the inner\npart of the disk intermediate layer (see Fig. 2). The other reactions include the pri+\nmal route to the formation of HCO+ and destruction of CO: H+\n+ H2\n3 + CO \u2192 HCO\n\u22129\n3 \u22121\n(\u03b1 = 1.7 \u00d7 10 cm s ; Kim et al. 1975) as well as the destruction of molecular nitrogen\nby ionized helium (\u03b1 = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 ; Woodall et al. 2007) and destruction of HCN\nby ionized carbon (\u03b1 = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm3 s\u22121 , \u03b2 = \u22120.5; Clary et al. 1985).\nAll of the 15 problematic neutral-neutral reactions for disk chemistry are reactions\ninvolving atoms (O, N, C, H, S) and either light hydrocarbons (Cn Hm , n=1,2, m=1\u20133) or CN,\nHCO, and H2 CO. In contrast to the IN reactions, the NN reactions are mainly important for\nthe chemical evolution of the key species in warm disk regions, in particular reaction with\natomic oxygen (Tscharnuter & Gail 2007). Though their rates are rather accurate, with\nuncertainties that are typically not higher than 50%, some of the NN rates are still different\nin RATE 06 and osu.2007 databases.\nThe NN reaction between N and HCO produces only OCN and H in osu.2007, with a\nrate coefficient of 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 (Smith et al. 2004). In RATE 06 this reaction has in addition\n2 other channels that form either HCN and O (\u03b1 = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 ) or CO and NH\n(\u03b1 = 5.7 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm3 s\u22121 , \u03b2 = 0.5, and \u03b3 = 1 000 K; Woodall et al. 2007).\nAnother reaction in the list is H + CH, which leads to C and H2 . In osu.2007, the rate\ncoefficient has a weak dependence on temperature and no barrier (\u03b1 = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm3 s\u22121 ,\n\u03b2 = 0.38; Le Teuff et al. 2000), while in RATE 06 this rate has \u03b2 = 0 and an 80 K barrier\n(\u03b1 = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 ; Woodall et al. 2007).\nFinally, the neutral-neutral reaction between H and CH2 , which forms CH and H2 , has\nthe osu.2007 rate coefficient of 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 taken from the UMIST 95 database, but\nthis value is only 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm3 s\u22121 in RATE 06.\nWe conclude that the reaction rates of many important ion-neutral and neutral-neutral\nreactions are not known accurately enough, as a major controversy in their temperature\ndependence still persists. This is particularly true for the reactions involving an ion and\na polar molecule, whose rates in RATE 06 can differ by a factor of \u223c 5 at 10 K for the\ndipole/non-dipole versions of this ratefile. The ion-polar rates in osu.2007 can be larger\nthan those in the dipole version of RATE06 by another factor of 4-5, especially for linear\nneutral reactants, in which allowance is made for sub-thermal rotational populations via the\nso-called \"locked-dipole\" approach.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n4.2.5. Dissociative recombination\nMolecular ions are efficiently converted into other, less complex molecules via dissociative recombination (DR) with electrons or charged grains. Similarly to IN reactions,\nthese processes are especially fast at low temperatures with typical rate coefficients of about\n10\u22126 cm\u22123 s\u22121 at 10 K due to the long-range Coulomb attraction. The DR rates can be measured rather accurately with afterglow and storage ring techniques (Florescu-Mitchell & Mitchell\n2006). However, the sensitivity of their branching ratios with respect to the temperature is mostly unexplored and may not be described by a simple power law at low T\n(Petrignani et al. 2005).\nA strong influence of the DR rates and branching ratios on the results of chemical models\nof molecular clouds has been found (Millar et al. 1988; Semaniak et al. 2001; Geppert et al.\n2005a). Our sensitivity method picked up two DR reactions that introduce significant uncertainties in computed abundances in protoplanetary disks. These include dissociative\nrecombination of protonated ammonia into ammonia and hydrogen atoms (50th place out\nof 56), and a main destruction channel for HCO+ (19th place, see Table 3). Note that their\nrates are supposed to be known within an uncertainty of 25%.\nThe DR of HCO+ in RATE 06 has one dissociative channel to CO and H with the total\nrate coefficient of 2.4\u00d710\u22127 cm3 s\u22121 and \u03b2 = \u22120.69 (Mitchell 1990). In the osu.2007 database\n2 additional channels are listed, which lead to the formation of either OH and C or CH and\nO but with a much smaller probability of \u223c 4% each. The DR of NH+\n4 in both RATE 06\nand osu.2007 involves 3 branching channels into NH2 and either two hydrogen atoms (21%)\nor one molecular hydrogen (10%), or ammonia and atomic hydrogen (69%) with the total\nrate of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm3 s\u22121 and \u03b2 = \u22120.5 (Vikor et al. 1999).\nStill, more effort needs to be invested into the (re-)investigation of the DR branching\nratios and their temperature-dependence, especially at low \u223c 10\u201320 K temperatures.\n5.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nThe influence of gas-phase reaction rate uncertainties on the results of disk chemical\nmodeling has been studied by a Monte Carlo method. The rate coefficients in the RATE 06\nnetwork were varied 8 000 times within their uncertainty limits using a log-normal distribution. Sets of abundances, column densities, and their error bars were computed for a number\nof key species in protoplanetary disks. We found that typical uncertainties of the molecular\ncolumn densities do not exceed a factor of 3\u20134 even for the largest of the key molecules,\nwhich is comparable with observational uncertainties. The column densities of CO, C+ ,\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n+\n+\nH+\n3 , H2 O, NH3 , N2 H , and HCNH have particularly small error bars. A straightforward\ncorrelation analysis between molecular abundances and reaction rates was performed for the\nentire evolutionary time, and the most problematic reactions involving CO, C+ , CS, HCO+ ,\nH2 CO, CN, HCN, and NH3 were identified. We showed that the rate coefficients of about a\nhundred chemical reactions constituting only a few percent of the entire RATE 06 database\nneed to be determined more accurately in order to significantly decrease uncertainties in\nthe modeled abundances and column densities of the key observable molecules. We argue\nthat it is worthwhile to (re-)investigate, either experimentally or theoretically, the rate coefficients of basic radiative association and cosmic ray ionization reactions as well as the\ntemperature-dependence of key ion-neutral and neutral-neutral reactions, and the branching\nratios and products of dissociative recombination processes. The rate uncertainties of cosmic\nray ionization and photoreactions are partly due to uncertain physical parameters such as\nthe CRP flux and UV penetration, and thus can be decreased with better physical models\nand observational data.\n\nA.V. appreciates financial support through a grant from the Dynasty Foundation and\nIMPRS fellowship.
