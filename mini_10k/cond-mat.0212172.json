Such an analysis allows one\nto probe the dominant kinds of electron-electron interactions as well as for signatures of electronic interaction\nwith bosonic modes. Such studies are an area of much\ncurrent focus in the ARPES community with, for instance, the observation of bosonic effects in the ARPES\nspectra of systems with strong electron-phonon coupling\nsuch as Be and Mo [6\u20138]. Recently, similar features have\nbeen found in the low-energy ARPES spectra of a number\nof high-temperature hole doped cuprate superconductors.\nA mass renormalization, or \"kink\", in the dispersion has\nbeen found ubiquitously in the p-type materials (at \u2248 70\nmeV) [9,10]; its origin is a matter of much current debate.\nSome groups have pointed to a many-body electronic\nsource [11\u201313], that is perhaps related to the magnetic\nresonance mode discovered via neutron scattering. However, this assignment has been disputed on the grounds\nthat the resonant mode may have insufficient spectral\nweight to cause the observed effect with reasonable estimates for its coupling strength [14,15]. Others have\nargued that the kink's presence above Tc and its universality among material classes demonstrate a phononic\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nAngle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nis one of the most direct probes of the electronic structure\nof solids. In recent years, with the advent of Scienta analyzers and high-flux beam lines, a new era of photoemission line-shape analysis has been ushered in [1,2]. These\nadvances offer unprecedentedly high momentum and energy resolution, as well as the ability to perform simultaneous parallel angle scanning and thereby generate direct\ntwo dimensional (2D) E \u2212 ~k images of ARPES spectral\nfunctions. Whereas, ARPES data have been displayed\ntraditionally as energy distribution curves (EDC's) in\nwhich the photoemission intensity is plotted as a function of energy at specific angles, now they can be represented in terms of these detailed 2D intensity plots and in\nanalogy with EDC's, complementary momentum distribution curves (MDC's) can be generated. Such advances\nare making new analysis methods possible, where one\nis able to bring to bear the considerable mathematical\nmachinery of many-body physics for intuition and interpretation.\nWithin the sudden approximation, ARPES measures\nthe single-particle spectral function A(~k, \u03c9) [1\u20133]. Assuming that the material under investigation has welldefined electronic excitations [4], the single-particle spectral function can be represented compactly in terms of a\ncomplex self-energy \u03a3 = \u03a3\u2032 + i\u03a3\u2032\u2032 as\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (~k, \u03c9)\n1\nA(~k, \u03c9) =\n\u03c0 [\u03c9 \u2212 \u01eb~ \u2212 \u03a3\u2032 (~k, \u03c9)]2 + [\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (~k, \u03c9)]2\nk\n\n(1)\n\n1\n\n\forigin and indicates the strong role that lattice effects\nhave on the low-energy physics [10].\nAlthough, in principle, it is straightforward with the\nabove analysis to extract the electronic self-energy from\nARPES spectra, it is not as obvious how to assign parts\nof the self-energy to different origins. For instance, is\nthe phenomenon that causes the kink the same one that\ncauses the pseudogap in the underdoped materials, or are\nmultiple effects playing a role? Moreover, there have even\nbeen reports that distinguish the kinks near the (\u03c0, 0) and\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) positions [13]. Similar manifestations of the\nvarious phononic, antiferromagnetic, charge order, stripe,\nand structural effects (not to mention the possibility of\nhidden orders [16]) that may exist in the cuprates, makes\nit difficult to extract unambiguous information from a\nspectral function analysis.\nSuch problems may be particularly acute in the electron doped system Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4 [17]. In previous\nARPES work on the \"optimally-doped\" (x = 0.15) system, high-energy pseudogap effects (i.e. the suppression\nof low-energy spectral weight over an extended frequency\nrange) similar to those in the underdoped p-type compounds were observed [18,19]. However, unlike in the\np-type materials, these regions of maximum pseudogap\nwere not on the Fermi surface (FS) near (\u03c0, 0) (the maximum of the dx2 \u2212y2 functional form), but instead at \"hotspots\" at the intersection of the FS with the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary [18]. This, along\nwith the fact that the antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases in the highest-Tc samples (x = 0.15) are\nin very close proximity to each other and may in fact\ncoexist, [20] led to the conclusion that this high-energy\npseudogap was due to the effects of antiferromagnetic\nor other orders with characteristic wave vector (\u03c0, \u03c0)\n[18]. As the signatures of boson-electron interactions\nare somewhat generic, it may be difficult to distinguish\ninteractions with different types of modes (for instance\nphonons vs spin fluctuations) if the regions of the BZ,\nwhere such effects are observed to be the strongest, overlap. In the context of Eq. 1, this raises the question\nof the ~k-independence of the self-energy implied in this\ntype of analysis, especially in the n-type materials where\nthe momentum-dependent scattering appears to be very\nstrong even near optimal doping [18].\nKeeping the above considerations in mind, we present\nan ARPES line-shape analysis of the electron doped (ntype) cuprate superconductor Nd1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4 . We use\nessentially same methodologies that have been employed\nin the study of the p-type compounds as we believe that\na direct comparison has utility despite the fact that there\nmay be possible complications. We find that there is no\nkink along the zone diagonal, in contrast to the p-type\nmaterials where this is the region of the BZ where it can\nbe most unambiguously identified. In the (\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0)\ndirection, a very weak kink in the quasiparticle dispersion can be found. However, it is not straightforward to\n\nidentify this effect with phonons, since competing effects\ncannot be separated unambiguously in this region of the\nBZ. Despite an apparent lack of a mass renormalization\nalong the zone diagonal, a very slight drop in the scattering rate is observed in this direction. No such drop in\nthe scattering rate is observed near the (\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) FS\ncrossing. As it is reasonable that this class of many-body\neffects along the nodal direction in the p-type compounds\ncan be identified with effects of phonons, the lack of a\nkink and weak drop in the scattering rate along the same\ndirection indicates a weaker electron-phonon interaction\nin Nd1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4 .\nII. EXPERIMENT\n\nAngle-resolved photoemission data were recorded at\nBeam line 10.0.1.1 of the Advanced Light Source with a\nphoton energy of 55 eV in a glancing-incidence geometry.\nThe polarization angles were 45\u25e6 to the Cu-O bonds for\nthe \u0393 to (\u03c0, \u03c0) cut and along the Cu-O bonds for the\n(\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) cut. The energy resolution was typically\n18 meV and angular resolution was 0.14\u25e6 (corresponding\nto \u2248 0.5% of the Brillouin zone size). This configuration\nis identical to that used in an extensive study of the kink\nin the hole doped compounds [10]. The samples were\ncleaved in situ at low temperatures in vacuum better\nthan 4 x 10\u221211 Torr. As there are only minor changes\nto the spectra when entering the superconducting state\n[19], all displayed spectra were taken at low temperature\n(\u2248 15-25 K). No signs of surface aging were seen for the\nduration of the experiment (\u2248 24 h). In addition to the\ndisplayed data, extensive measurements were performed\non Beam line 5-4 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory; results were obtained that are consistent with those displayed here.\nSingle crystals of Nd1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4 were grown by the\ntraveling-solvent grown method in 4 atm. of O2 . The\nas-grown crystals are not superconducting and must be\nannealed to remove excess apical oxygen. The displayed\ndata come from samples that were heated in flowing argon gas for 20 h at 920\u25e6 C, and then a further 20 h at\n500\u25e6C under pure O2 [21]. Resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements show an onset of the superconducting transition at 24 K.\n\nIII. RESULTS\n\nIn Fig. 1, we show the raw data in the form of 2D\nintensity plots of the spectral function, along with the\ncorresponding EDC's for ~k-space cuts, in the \u0393 to (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nand the (\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) directions.

As pointed out previously [18], this\nis behavior not unlike that found in optimally doped ptype compounds. In the (\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) direction, an\nalmost parabolic-shaped band centered around (\u03c0, 0) is\nobserved. A similar sharpening of the feature as it disperses to EF is seen here as well, however, the |~k| < |~kF |\nEDC's seem to show additional structure in the form of\ntwo separate peaks. This aspect has been also noted previously [18,19,22].\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n(a)\n0\n\n(\u03c0,0)\n-0.4\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c9=0\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nmomentum (1.4 \u03c0/a)\nmomentum (\u03c0/a)\nFIG. 3.

At energies higher than those displayed,\nthe MDC line-shape begins to differ more significantly\nfrom a simple Lorentzian.\nAt the displayed relevant lower energies, the\nLorentzian functional forms fit the MDC's relatively well,\nshowing that, although there may be large momentum\ndependence in the self-energy in other parts of the BZ,\nthe changes across the displayed regions are minimal at\nlow energy. The fact that the fits begin to break down\nat higher energies indicates that momentum dependent\neffects may become relevant. These fits to the peaks positions are displayed in Fig. 4 with the corresponding\nenergy widths \u03a3\u2032\u2032 shown in Fig. 5.

This is in sharp contrast to the p-type materials where this is the region of the BZ that shows the\nmost unambiguous effect at \u2248 70 meV.\nThe behavior along the (\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction differs\nfrom that of the zone diagonal. Here, the smooth dispersion deviates at low energy from the parabolic fit in the\nregion indicated by the arrow in Fig 4b. The deviation\nin the dispersion is greater than the uncertainty in the\nfit. The small mass renormalization around 55 meV has\nthe same energy scale as the dip structure in the EDC in\nFig. 2. This is close to the same energy scale as the mass\nrenormalization onset in the p-type compounds. If one\nis to identify this apparent mass change with coupling to\na bosonic mode, a simple analysis for the dimensionless\n~\nv0\ncoupling parameter \u03bb\u2032 = vFF \u2212 1 gives a value \u03bb\u2032 \u2248 0.3.\nThis may be compared with values \u2248 0.5 extracted via\nthe same method from the zone diagonal direction of the\np-type materials near optimal doping [23]. In this simple analysis, we used as a value for ~vF0 the velocity from\nthe dispersion above the expected kink energy and the\n~vF from a low -\u03c9 fit, as was done in the analysis for the\np-type materials [10].\nCloser to the spirit of how a mass renormalization\nis typically defined would be to use a \u03c9 \u2192 0 extrapolation of a function fitted to the dispersion at higher\nenergy (\u03c9 > 100 meV). Analyzing the data in this\nfashion gives velocities of ~vF0ef f (\u03c9 \u2192 0) = 4.3 \u00d7 105\nm/sec (2.3 eV*a/h\u0304\u03c0) for the \u0393-(\u03c0, \u03c0) FS crossing and\n~vF0ef f (\u03c9 \u2192 0) = 3.4 \u00d7 105 m/sec (1.8 eV*a/h\u0304\u03c0) for the\n(\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) FS crossing. Using this value for vF0 for the\n(\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) cut gives a smaller \u03bb\u2032 of \u2248 0.1. However,\nthe values for \u03bb\u2032 near (\u03c0, 0) arrived at in this fashion are\nnot readily comparable to those of the hole doped compounds along the zone diagonal as their dispersion there\ndoes not appear to recover to something resembling an\nunrenormalized dispersion within the experimental window. This is most likely a consequence of the fact that\nfor straightforward electron-boson coupling one expects\nthat the dispersion recovers to the bare one within about\n5 times the bosonic band width. In the (\u03c0, 0) region of\nthe BZ, the local bare electronic band width may be narrower than this bosonic bound, so one has to regain a\nparabolic dispersion more quickly.\nWe note that finite resolution effects should not cause\nan inaccurate parametrization except very close to the\nFermi energy. Close to EF where the Fermi function\ndiffers significantly from unity, finite energy resolution\n(\u2206E) weights the signal at each individual \u03c9 point disproportionately towards higher energy so that only fits to\n\u03c9 higher than \u2206E are reliable and intrinsic. The sharp\nchange to higher velocity at \u03c9 < 15 meV in the \u0393 to\n(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction is obviously explained by effects of this\nkind.

The arrow marks the position of the\nlow-energy kink.\n\nregion show also a sharp decrease in scattering rate along\nthe zone diagonal. We consider this also to be an artifact\nof finite energy resolution, although the reason such an\neffect does not show up in the (\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) direction is\nan open question.\nAs detailed above, the widths of the MDC Lorentzians\ncan be parametrized as \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (~k, \u03c9)/~vF0 . Like the case of \u03bb\u2032 ,\nin the absence of a definitive independent measure for ~vF0 ,\nwe use for ~vF0ef f the ~v from a \u03c9 \u2192 0 extrapolation of a fit\nto the higher-energy dispersion to get a rough estimate\nfor \u03a3\u2032\u2032 . For instance, in the (\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction, we\nuse the value for the ~vF0 of the fitted parabola.

The vertical bar at 0.18 eV marks the energy\nbeyond which the MDC width fits are not reliable. Vertical\nbars represent the uncertainty in the fitted Lorenztian width.\n\nAlong the \u0393-(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction (Fig. 5a) \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) is best fit\n(solid line) in the higher energy region (0.4 eV> \u03c9 >0.09\neV) to a power law form, \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (0) + A\u03c9 \u03b1 , with\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (0) = 0.14 eV and \u03b1 = 1.55. Note, that the best fit to\n\n4\n\n\fa linear dependence (dashed line) with a \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (0) of 0.11 eV\ndoes not fit nearly as well. We observe a low-energy drop\nin \u03a3\u2032\u2032 at approximately 0.07 eV. Although the drop is\nsubtle, we believe the effect to be intrinsic as it was seen\nin a number of samples and is outside the uncertainty in\nthe fits as represented by the error bars. Note that this is\nclose to the same energy that the mass renormalization\nis found at in the (\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction. The precipitous\ndrop in \u03a3\u2032\u2032 for \u03c9 < 15 meV is found from fitted MDC's\nthat gave the artificial upturn in the dispersion in Fig.\n4a and therefore appears to be an artifact of finite energy\nresolution.\nIn contrast, along the (\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction, \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) is\nbest fit by a linear dependence on \u03c9 with \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (0) = 0.08\neV with no signature of a low-\u03c9 drop in the scattering\nrate. Note that due to the much smaller local electronic\nband width in this region of the BZ, the MDC Lorentzian\nfit breaks down at energies higher than \u2248 0.2 eV as may\nhave been expected from a visual inspection of Fig. 1c.\nIt is interesting to note that \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (0), extracted in this way,\nis very different for the two directions. Also note that the\nfinite energy (\u2206E) and momentum resolution (\u2206~k) only\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\ngive\nq a minor broadening contribution to \u03a3 as \u2206\u03a3 =\n(\u2202E~ /\u2202~k * \u2206~k)2 + (\u2206E)2 \u2248 28 meV.\n\nture is well above EF . In this way, such a BZ reducing\norder may be expected to greatly modify the spectral\nfunction near (\u03c0, 0), but not as much near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) for\nan unreconstructed hole-like Fermi surface centered at\n(\u03c0, \u03c0). Two such features in the EDC can give a kink in\nthe effective dispersion if an MDC analysis is performed.\nAs it has been previously noted that there are two features in the EDC's near the (\u03c0, 0) position [18,19,22] (see\nFig. 2b) and there is evidence for fluctuations of some\nkind of (\u03c0, \u03c0) symmetry reducing order, we do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to unambiguously\nassign the (\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) kink feature, found by an MDC\nanalysis, the same origin as the kink observed in the ptype compounds. We believe there is no means to unambiguously separate the (\u03c0, \u03c0) symmetry reducing effect.\nIn this regard, the kink found along (\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) in the\npresent work appears to be of a different sort than the\nzone diagonal kink found in the p-type. The current case\nmay be an example of a mass renormalization due to the\neffects of generic residual antiferromagnetism (i.e. not a\nresonance mode) or other symmetry reducing order with\ncharacteristic wavevector (\u03c0, \u03c0), and therefore its observation does not directly bear on the debate regarding\nthe relative merits of the phonon vs magnetic resonance\nmode scenarios for the spectral function of the cuprates.\nDespite the uncertainties in the MDC analysis one can\nmake a strong statement about the lack of a kink along\nthe zone diagonal. By the same condition as given above,\nin this region of the BZ, we do not expect to see (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nfeatures (nor are any observed) as the unreconstructed\nFermi sea is only filled on one side of antiferromagnetic\nBZ boundary. Visual inspection of the MDC fitted dispersion in the 0.2 eV > \u03c9 > 0 eV range shows there is\nno feature resembling a sharp kink in the dispersion [24].\nThe dependence of the scattering rate on frequency\nalong the zone diagonal is different from the linear dependence reported in the optimally doped p-type materials\n[25] (note that some groups have found possible deviations from linear [26]). This stronger \u03c9 1.55 dependence\nin the electron doped compounds compares more closely\nto the quadratic temperature dependence of their resistivity that to the linear temperature dependence of the\nhole doped materials at optimal doping [27,28].\nOur results for \u03a3\u2032\u2032 may also be compared to the linear dependence of the low-energy (>1000 cm\u22121 ) scattering rate that has been found by an inversion of the\noptical conductivity [29,30]. The conventional wisdom is\nthat zone diagonal states give the primary contribution\nto transport due to their supposedly higher ~vF . At first\nglance this is not consistent with our finding here. However, as we have found for the electron doped material\nthat the ~vF at the \u0393-(\u03c0, \u03c0) FS crossing is not greatly\ndifferent from that found at the (\u03c0, 0)-(\u03c0, \u03c0) FS crossing\n[this is another consequence of the fact that the (\u03c0, 0)\nsaddle point is \u2248 300 meV below EF ], the (\u03c0, 0) region (where a linear dependence is found) may contribute\n\nk\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nAs discussed above and in Ref. [10], due to its ubiquity,\ntemperature dependence, and energy scale, the strong velocity renormalizations in the p-type materials has been\nattributed to an interaction of the charge-carriers with\nphononic degrees of freedom. In the n-type compounds\nwe see some evidence of similar effects although important differences exist. As detailed above, there is no kink\nalong the zone diagonal, which is the region of the BZ\nthat shows the most unambiguous effect in the hole doped\nmaterials. There does appear to be a kink along the (\u03c0, 0)\nto (\u03c0, \u03c0) direction. However, as we will discuss below, the\ninterpretation of this feature is not straightforward.\nIf there exists a symmetry reducing order (or associated fluctuations) with characteristic wave vector (\u03c0, \u03c0),\nthen one may expect to see two features in the EDC's in\nportions of the BZ where the unreconstructed band structure is below EF in momentum regions straddling both\nsides of the antiferromagnetic BZ boundary since the effect of such an order is to reflect features across the antiferromagnetic BZ boundary, i.e., spectral features from\n(h, k) would be expected to show up at (\u2212h + \u03c0, \u2212k + \u03c0).\nFor instance, EDC's from near the Fermi surface near\n(\u03c0, 0.3\u03c0), would have features reflective of the unreconstructed bands well below EF from near (0.7\u03c0, 0). In\ncontrast, EDC's from the band near (0.45\u03c0, 0.45\u03c0) will\nnot have features that derive from near (0.55\u03c0, 0.55\u03c0) as\nthis region of the BZ in the unreconstructed band struc-\n\n5\n\n\fsomewhat equally to the optical scattering rate. Moreover, as may be seen in Fig. 5a, the scattering rate along\nthe zone diagonal can be fit approximately by a linear\ndependence above 130 meV and it may be that it is this\nenergy which is contributing the most to the optical excitations for E\u03b3 >1000 cm\u22121 (\u2248 100 meV). Optical experiments also find a low-energy drop in the scattering\nrate below an energy (650 cm \u22121 \u2248 70 meV) very close\nto that where we find the depression in \u03a3\u2032\u2032 and a mass\nrenormalization [29,30].\nThe energy at which we observe the mass renormalization along the (\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) direction is the same energy,\nto within experimental uncertainty, that we observe the\ndrop in the scattering rate along \u0393 - (\u03c0, \u03c0). Although\nthese energy scales are consistent with each other, this\nobservation is inconsistent with Kramers-Kronig considerations. Since \u03a3\u2032 and \u03a3\u2032\u2032 are real and imaginary components derived from the same response function, they\nshould be related via a Kramers-Kronig transform due\nto causality. If \u03a3\u2032 along a particular cut shows a kink,\nthen \u03a3\u2032\u2032 should show a corresponding drop. The reason why such a behavior is not observed is unclear, but\nmay be related to momentum dependence in the selfenergy masking such effects. If the self-energy is momentum dependent, the dispersion and width obtained\nfrom an MDC analysis cannot be simply related to \u03a3\u2032\nand \u03a3\u2032\u2032 , respectively. It does seem that the qualitative\nconclusion that there is little renormalization along the\nzone diagonal remains valid. The situation for the (\u03c0, 0)(\u03c0, \u03c0) direction is less clear, as the mass renormalization\nis present here and the situation to compare to in the\np-types near (\u03c0, 0) more uncertain.\nAs detailed above, it seems reasonable to associate the\nmass renormalization on the p-type side of the phase\ndiagram with a strong coupling of charge carriers to\nphononic degrees of freedom. Specifically, the principal\nphonon has been conjectured [10] to be the oxygen halfbreathing mode, which is seen to have anomalous softening and spectral weight changes in the relevant energy\nrange near the doping induced metal-insulator transition\nas probed by neutron scattering [31\u201334]. A number of\nrecent studies have found similar signatures of phononic\nanomalies in the electron doped materials [35,36]. Kang\net al. found changes with doping in the generalized\nphonon density of states around \u2248 70 meV by neutron\nscattering. d'Astuto et al. measured phonon dispersions\nvia inelastic x-ray scattering and assigned the softening\nthey found in the 55 - 75 meV energy range to the same\noxygen half-breathing mode that anomalies are found in\nin the p-type materials. These studies give evidence for\nphononic effects in the electron doped materials that are\nsomewhat similar to those found in the hole doped compounds.\nThere are a number of differences that do exist in\nthese anomalies that may provide a starting point for\nunderstanding why similar signatures in the boson spec-\n\ntrum may not cause similar eefects to appear in ARPES.\nAlthough the biggest changes in the phonon density of\nstates probed by Kang et al. happen at similar doping\nlevels in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 and Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4 (x \u2248 0.04),\nthe doping levels are at very different relative positions in\nthe phase diagram, with x = 0.04 being still well into the\nantiferromagnetic (and possibly more insulating) phase\nfor the electron doped compound. As such modifications\nin the phonon spectrum may be associated generally with\nscreening changes (and hence electron-phonon coupling)\nwith the onset of metallicity, this demonstrates the possibility that the changes in the NCCO phonon spectrum,\nalthough superficially similar in the electron and hole\ndoped materials, are in some sense different. d'Astuto\net al. found that although the softening of the phonon\ndispersion appears in a somewhat similar way at a similar energy scale as in the p-types compounds, differences\ndo exist in the shape of the anomaly in the phonon dispersion. Moreover, on general grounds, since the purported soft phonon is the oxygen half-breathing mode,\none may naively expect a weaker coupling for this mode\nwith electron doping, as Madelung potential considerations [37] indicate that doped electrons will preferentially\nsit on the Cu site, whereas doped holes have primarily\noxygen character.\nKang et al. have mentioned [35] that it would be interesting to look for mass renormalizations in the ARPES\nspectra of the n-type underdoped compounds that they\nfirst detect phonon anomalies in. However, we believe\nthat if the electron-phonon coupling is of the same nature in the n\u2212 and p\u2212 type materials it should reveal\nitself in the ARPES spectra of the highest-Tc electron\ndoped samples, as it does in the hole doped materials.\nMoreover, the issue of looking for mass renormalizations\nand at peak widths may not even be relevant at the extremely low dopings (x = 0.04) where Kang et al. see the\nlargest changes in the phonon density of states, as there\nare only regions of the BZ with enhanced near-EF spectral weight and no well-defined electronic peaks [38]. The\nquestion of what the electron-phonon coupling parameter is as one enters the Mott insulating state at very low\ndoping, may not even be particularly well posed, as the\nnear-EF spectral weight vanishes as x = 0 is approached.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nA modern spectral function analysis reveals very different and likely weaker signatures of possible bosonic\neffects in the ARPES spectra of Nd1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4 along\nthe two main symmetry directions of the BZ as compared\nto the hole doped compounds. However, unlike the ptype compounds, we believe that one cannot distinguish\nthe various contributions to the self-energy into separate\neffects, as the simple analysis yields results which are not\nconsistent with Kramers-Kronig considerations. Despite\n6\n\n\fthe complexities inherent in assigning various features in\nthe spectra to distinct sources, a direct comparison between the p- and n-type compounds does have utility, as\nwe have shown the lack of a mass renormalization along\nthe zone diagonal. Our analysis shows that whatever\nis causing the distinct effect in the hole doped materials manifests itself less strongly on the n-type side, perhaps due to a weaker electron-phonon coupling or masking effects from other interactions. Although such observations are consistent with a weaker electron-phonon\ncoupling in the electron doped cuprates, a strong discrepancy exists between these measurements and a number of scattering studies that point to strong electronphonon coupling. Perhaps, some of the intrinsic differences between electron and hole doped materials may\nprovide a route towards reconciling these different measurements and thereby giving insight into the underlying\nphenomenon.\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nVI.

If, in fact, the cuprates are non-Fermi\nliquids in the sense that the fundamental excitations have\nintegrity that are distinct from electrons, this analysis\nmay not be valid. Indeed, in such a case or in any case\nwhere the MDC's are not well represented as Lorentzians,\nthis analysis will cause an inaccurate and unphysical parameterizations of the spectra.\nC. M.
