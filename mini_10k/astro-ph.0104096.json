The star counts imply a yellow PAGB lifetime of about\n25,000 yr, and their luminosities imply masses near 0.53 M\u2299 .\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn this paper we will discuss several aspects of post-AGB (PAGB)\nstars in old stellar systems, in particular those in globular clusters (GCs)\nand in the halos of the Milky Way and other galaxies.\nSpecifically, we will discuss observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) of the planetary nebula in the GC M15, ground-based observations of two PAGB stars in the GC NGC 5986, and ground-based\n\n1\n\n\f2\nsearches for PAGB stars in the halos of nearby galaxies and their possible\napplication as standard candles for measuring extragalactic distances.\n\n2.\n\nK 648 IN M15\n\nSince this work has now been published in detail (Alves, Bond, &\nLivio 2000), we give only a fairly brief summary here.\nK\u00fcstner 648 in M15 is one of just four planetary nebulae (PNe) known\nin Galactic GCs. It was the first to be found (Pease 1928), and it was\nmore than six decades before the other three were discovered: in M22\n(Gillett et al. 1989) and Pal 6 and NGC 6441 (Jacoby et al. 1997). As\nJacoby et al. point out, this number is lower than expected if every star\nnow evolving in a GC makes a PN.\nThere are several lines of argument that PAGB evolution in GCs is\nslow compared to the timescale for dissipation of a PN into space following its ejection at the tip of the AGB. First, recent HST detections of\nwhite dwarfs in nearby GCs (Renzini et al. 1996; Cool, Piotto, & King\n1996; Richer et al. 1997) indicate that the remnant masses are very low\n(0.50 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299 ; see Alves et al. 2000 for details). PAGB stars of masses\n< 0.55M -the lowest for which calculations have been made-already\n\u2299\n\u223c\nhave theoretical evolutionary timescales that are much longer than the\ndissipation timescale for PNe (Sch\u00f6nberner 1983; Vassiliadis & Wood\n1994), and the timescales should be even longer at masses of \u223c0.5 M\u2299 .\nIn support of this expectation, star counts of PAGB stars in the M31\nhalo (see below) indicate quite long lifetimes for the portion of the postAGB evolution from effective temperatures of 5,000 to 10,000 K. It is\nthus unlikely that typical halo stars will ever be able to ionize visible\nPNe.\nThe question then shifts from \"Why are there so few PNe in GCs?\"\nto \"Why are there any PNe at all?\". Jacoby et al. (1997) proposed that\nthe observed GC PNe were formed through close-binary interactions,\nalthough they did not propose any specific mechanisms.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we obtained observations of K 648\nand its central star with HST and its WFPC2 over an interval of 7 days,\nin order to search for variations in the brightness of the nucleus due to\nheating effects in a close binary system. As discussed in our paper, we\ndid not find any variations, and thus have no direct evidence that the\nnucleus is at present a close binary.\nHowever, the argument can be pressed further by considering the\nluminosity of the central star. By combining our accurate measurement of the star's V magnitude with its known effective temperature\n(40, 000 \u00b1 3, 000 K, based on spectroscopic observations cited in our pa-\n\n\fPAGB Stars in Pop II Systems\n\n3\n\nper), we find log(L/L\u2299 ) = 3.74 \u00b1 0.08. We can now compare its position\nin the HR diagram with theoretical PAGB tracks, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFigure 1 Position of central star of K 648 in the HR diagram, compared with theoretical post-AGB tracks of Sch\u00f6nberner (1979, 1983) and Bl\u00f6cker (1995). The initial\nand final masses for each track are indicated at the right. The implied mass of the\nnucleus is 0.60 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299 .\n\nAlthough the PAGB tracks plotted in Fig. 1 are for solar metallicity,\nthey still illustrate that the mass of the central star of K 648 is significantly above that of the stellar remnants currently evolving in GCs,\nwhich, as noted, are about 0.5 M\u2299 . Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) find a\nPAGB luminosity/core-mass relation of L/L\u2299 = 56694(Mc /M\u2299 \u2212 0.5),\nnearly independent of metallicity, and applicable to both hydrogen- and\nhelium-burning tracks. Using this formula, we find that the mass of the\nK 648 central star is 0.60 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299 (the error estimate includes only\nobservational errors, not any errors in the theory).\nSince the K 648 central star is more massive than the normal stellar\nremnants in GCs, we conclude that the progenitor experienced mass\naugmentation at some point in its prior evolutionary history, most likely\nfrom a close-binary interaction. A plausible scenario is one in which a\nclose binary on the main sequence underwent a W UMa-type contact\nstage, followed by coalescence (at which time it would probably have\nappeared as a blue straggler in the color-magnitude diagram). The star\nsubsequently evolved as a more massive object than the bulk of the single\nstars (which have masses \u223c0.8 M\u2299 ), allowing it to produce a 0.6 M\u2299\n\n\f4\nremnant which evolved rapidly enough to ionize its ejected AGB envelope\nbefore the envelope had time to dissipate.\nOur detailed study of K 648 supports the hypothesis that all halo\nPNe, including those in GCs and in the halo field, are descendants of\nclose binaries, and that single stars in old populations do not make PNe.\n\n3.\n\nTHE POST-AGB A-F STARS IN NGC 5986\n\nThis work has now also been published (Alves, Bond, & Onken 2001),\nso again we will give only a short summary here.\nPopulation II stars evolving off the AGB and passing through spectral\ntypes F and A are the visually brightest members of old populations (due\nto the behavior of the bolometric correction with effective temperature).\nThese stars should have a narrow luminosity function (LF), because\nessentially a single main-sequence turnoff mass is feeding the PAGB region of the HR diagram. Moreover these \"yellow\" PAGB stars are easily\nrecognized because of their enormous Balmer jumps. For these reasons\n(summarized in more detail by Bond 1997), we believe that yellow PAGB\nstars in old populations show great promise as a new standard candle for\nmeasuring extragalactic distances, especially to early-type galaxies that\ncontain no Cepheid variables. A zero-point calibration for the luminosities of Pop II yellow PAGB stars may be set using those in Galactic GCs.\nThe little-studied southern GC NGC 5986 is remarkable because it\ncontains two candidate A-F type PAGB stars, discovered some years ago\nduring a photographic grism survey (Bond 1977). Cluster membership\nwas confirmed by their radial velocities and by Str\u00f6mgren photometry\nshowing very low surface gravities. These two stars are potential primary\nzero-point calibrators for PAGB absolute magnitudes.\nWe have obtained CCD photometry of NGC 5986, from which we have\nderived a reddening and distance modulus of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.29 \u00b1 0.02\nand (m \u2212 M )0 = 15.15 \u00b1 0.10, respectively (see Alves et al. 2001 for\ndetails). The two yellow PAGB stars have the same V magnitudes to\nwithin \u00b10.05 mag, confirming the expectation of a very narrow LF and\nsupporting the idea that they may constitute a useful new standard\ncandle. By including also the absolute magnitude of the bright A-type\nstar ROA 24 in the GC \u03c9 Cen (Gonz\u00e1lez & Wallerstein 1992), we find\na mean MV (PAGB) = \u22123.28 \u00b1 0.07. Fig. 2 shows the locations of the\ntwo PAGB stars in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC 5986.\nWe now have underway a CCD survey of about 100 Galactic GCs,\nusing our new uBVI photometric system (see below), in order to find\nmore examples of yellow PAGB stars and strengthen the zero-point determination.\n\n\fPAGB Stars in Pop II Systems\n\n5\n\nFigure 2 CMD of NGC 5986, from Alves, Bond, & Onken (2001). The cluster's two\nPAGB stars are shown as asterisks; they are the brightest stars in the cluster, with\nabsolute magnitudes near MV = \u22123.3. Also marked with circled dots are the cluster's\nRR Lyrae variables, some 4 mag fainter than the PAGB stars.\n\n4.\n\nYELLOW PAGB STARS IN HALOS OF\nLOCAL GROUP GALAXIES\n\nAs described above, yellow PAGB stars show promise as a standard\ncandle, and are easily detectable using a photometric system that is sensitive to their large Balmer jumps. We have been developing a new CCD\nphotometric system that combines the Gunn u filter (lying almost entirely below the Balmer jump) with the standard Johnson-Kron-Cousins\nBVI bandpasses.\nIn a preliminary analysis of frames taken in the halo of M31, Bond and\nLaura Fullton have discovered a sequence of stars with 0 < (B \u2212V ) < 0.5\nand large u \u2212 B color indices, which are strong candidates for PAGB\nstars belonging to M31. Their mean V is 20.88 \u00b1 0.06. If we use the\npreliminary zero-point of MV = \u22123.3 based on NGC 5986 and \u03c9 Cen, as\noutlined above, we obtain an M31 distance modulus of (m\u2212M )V = 24.2,\nin reasonably good agreement with that based on Cepheids and other\nindicators, but requiring only about an hour of 4-m telescope time!\nBond & Fullton (1997) have also obtained uBVI frames of NGC 205,\na dwarf elliptical companion of M31. Here we find a sequence of yellow\nPAGB stars some 0.35 mag fainter than those belonging to the super-\n\n\f6\nposed halo of M31, suggesting that NGC 205 is \u223c100 kpc further away\nthan M31 itself (in fair agreement with distances from PNe and RR Lyrae\nvariables, although these observations have somewhat greater uncertainties due to the small number of PNe in NGC 205 and the faintness of\nthe RR Lyr stars).\nThe star counts in the M31 halo fields imply a PAGB lifetime of\n\u223c25,000 yr (for the portion of the evolution from B \u2212 V = 0.5 to 0.0\nonly), confirming as noted in our comments on K 648 that PAGB evolution is extremely leisurely in old populations. The luminosities of the\nM31 PAGB candidates imply a mean mass of \u223c0.53M\u2299 , in reasonable\nagreement with the masses inferred for white dwarfs in old populations.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from NASA (grant NAG 5-6821) for the work\non PAGB stars in galactic halos, and from STScI (grant GO-6751) for the work on\nK 648.
