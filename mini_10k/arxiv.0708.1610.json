We attribute the relaxation effects to diffusion of oxygen\nvacancies - a process with energy barrier similar to the observed activation energy.\nPACS numbers: 72.15.Lh, 73.50.-h\n\nPerovskites attract considerable interest for their wide\nrange of intriguing properties, including colossal magnetoresistance in manganites [1, 2], high-TC superconductivity in cuprates [3], ferroelectricity in titanates [4],\nand itinerant magnetism (ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism) in ruthenates [5, 6]. In addition to their\nindividual intriguing properties, for applications, it is\nparticularly appealing that perovskites-based heteroepitaxial structures can be grown epitaxially, commonly on\nSrTiO3 , thus enabling a wide spectrum of new functionalities which may form the basis for future oxide electronics.\nIn addition to serving as a substrate for perovskite\nfilms, SrTiO3 may be used to produce high mobility conductors that would be useful in future oxide electronics.\nA familiar way to obtain a SrTiO3 - based high mobility\nconductor is by electron doping [7, 8]. Recently it has\nbeen demonstrated that SrTiO3 \u2212 LaAlO3 heterostructures prepared in a particular way also yield high mobility\nconductivity. Some groups attributed this phenomenon\nto the formation of a quasi two dimensional electron gas\nat the SrTiO3 \u2212 LaAlO3 interface due to polarity discontinuity [9, 10], while others argue that it is related to the\nformation of oxygen vacancies [11, 12, 13].\nBoth methods yield high mobilities on the order of\n10, 000 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 at 4.2 K [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], suggesting SrTiO3 may be an important component in oxidebased electronic devices. Some possibilities for such use\nhave been demonstrated already in its use as a gate [14]\nand a channel [15, 16] in field effect transistors.\nElectron doping SrTiO3 is commonly achieved by creating oxygen vacancies which transform SrTiO3 into\nSrTiO3\u2212\u03b4 . Oxygen vacancies may be induced in various\nways including high-temperature annealing in oxygen reduced pressure, and Ar+ -irradiation [7, 8, 17, 18, 19].\nAr+ irradiation is also the method that we use to\nelectron-dope our samples.\nFor any future applications of electron-doped SrTiO3 ,\nit is important to elucidate the stability of its electrical properties over time. For this reason, in this report\nwe focus on relaxation effects of electrical transport in\nelectron-doped SrTiO3 . We have irradiated single crystal samples of SrTiO3 with Ar+ and explored the changes\n\nin the sheet resistance, mobility and magnetoresistance\n(MR). We find that while the sheet resistance changes\nwith time (although qualitatively it remains unchanged),\nthe mobility and the MR are time-independent. Our\nanalysis indicates that the activation energy for the observed relaxation is about 1 eV which is the energy scale\nobserved for diffusion of oxygen vacancies. This suggests\nthat diffusion of oxygen vacancies is responsible for the\nobserved relaxation effects.\nOur samples are commercially available [20] one sided\npolished SrTiO3 crystals (5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 0.5 mm3 ). The SrTiO3\nsamples were irradiated with Ar+ ions, accelerated with\n4 kV and the beam's fluence was about 1015 ions per\nsecond per cm2 . The estimated penetration depth of the\nions, L, in \u00c5 is given by the empirical formula [21, 22]\nE 2/3 W\nL = 1.1 1/4\n1/4 2 where E is the energy in eV, W is\n\u03c1(Zi\n\n+Zt\n\n)\n\nthe atomic weight of the target in atomic mass units, \u03c1\nis the target density, and Zi , Zt are the atomic numbers\nof the ions and the target, respectively (since SrTiO3 is a\ncompound, we use for the target the weighted average of\nthe atomic weights and numbers). In our case L \u2248 120\u00c5;\ntherefore, we expect that the thickness of the conducting\nlayer will be on this order.\nThe samples become conducting when the irradiation\ntime exceeds 30 sec and no more changes in conductivity are observed after several minutes of irradiation. To\nirradiate specific parts of a substrate in shapes that will\nallow resistivity and Hall measurement, we use conventional photolithography that leaves 1 micron-thick photoresist on the samples except for windows in the desired\nshapes.\nFigure 1a shows sheet resistance of Ar+ -irradiated\nSrTiO3 , determined with four point measurements. At\nlow temperatures a quadratic behavior is observed for the\nsheet resistance (R\u0003 ), R\u0003 = a+bT 2, typical for electronelectron interactions (except for samples with very high\nsheet resistance that exhibit resistivity minima). We note\nthat the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in our samples\nexceeds in some cases 500. Similar and even higher values\nof RRR have been reported for electron-doped SrTiO3\nand SrTiO3 \u2212 LaAlO3 heterostructures [11].\nThe sheet resistance decreases significantly with irra-\n\n\f2\n104\n\n5\n\n10\n\n105\n\nMobility [cm /(V*Sec)]\n\n(a)\n4\n\n103\n\n104\n\n102\n\n103\n\n101\n\n102\n\n\u0001\n\n3\n\n10\n\n20000\n15000\n\n\u0005\n\u0004\n\n( )\n\n2\n\n10000\n\nR\n\n1\n\n10\n\nR ( )\n\nR ( )\n\n2\n\n10\n\n60 seconds of irradiation\n90 seconds of irradiation\n\n5000\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n4\n\n150\nT (K)\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n7000\n2\nR ( )\n\n200\n\n100\n\n14000\n\n250\n\n300\n\ndR /dt (\n\nsec)\n\n4\n\n1.8 10\n\n1\n0.1\n\nR ( )\n\n\u0003 1.6 104\n\u0002\n\n0.001\n\n1.4 10\n\n320K\n\n310K\n300K\n\n4\n\n1.2 10\n\n290K\n280K\n\n1 104\n\n0\n\n100\n\n150 200\nT (K)\n\n250\n\n101\n300\n\n330K\n\n0.01\n\n\b\n\n0.0001\n280 290 300 310 320 330 340\nT (K)\n\n4\n\n50\n\nFIG. 2: Mobility and sheet resistance (R\u0003 ) in an Ar+ irradiated SrTiO3 as a function of temperature after 60 (circles)\nand after 90 (squares) seconds of irradiation.\n\n2 10\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nt (hour)\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Sheet resistance (R\u0003 ) of Ar+ irradiated SrTiO3\nas a function of temperature after 30 (squares) and 90 (circles) seconds of irradiation.

The line is a\nE\nfit for \u03b1e\u2212 kT\n\ndiation until saturation is obtained. As we can see from\nthe inset of Figure 1a, there is a linear relation between\nsheet resistances measured after different doses of irradiation (except for the range of temperatures with resistivity\nminima - if it exists). This indicates that in this range of\ndoping there is no qualitative change in the resistivity.\nTime-dependent measurements (Figure 1b) show that\nthe sheet resistance of the irradiated sample changes with\ntime at a temperature-dependent rate. Similar to the\nrelation between sheet resistance with different doses of\nirradiation, we find a linear relation also between sheet\n\nresistances measured after different waiting times (see\ninset of Figure 1a); namely, there is no qualitative change\nin the resistivity behavior.\nTo extract the relevant energy scale for the relaxation\nin the sheet resistance, we explore the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate. As seen in the inset\nof Figure 1b, this rate is well fitted with Arrhenius law,\n\u03b1e\u2212E/kT , where E\u2248 0.97eV . This activation energy is\npractically identical to the activation energy of oxygen\nvacancies in SrTiO3 [23] and Ba0.5 Sr0.5 TiO3 [24]. Hence,\nthe observed relaxation is very likely due to diffusion of\noxygen vacancies. While we do not address here the\nchange in the conducting regions due to this diffusion,\nwe note that irradiated regions which are few microns\napart remain electrically disconnected.\nIn the following we explore how this diffusion affects\nother transport properties.\nFigure 2 shows the mobility and sheet resistance of\none of our irradiated samples after 60 and 90 seconds of\nirradiation. In contrast to the resistance, the change of\nthe mobility with irradiation dose and relaxation time\nis hardly detectable. The observed mobility is consistent\nin magnitude and temperature dependence with previous\nreports [11].\nFigure 3 shows the MR at various temperatures measured after two different relaxation times. Similar to the\nmobility, the magnetoresistance \u2206\u03c1/\u03c1 does not change\nwith relaxation time or irradiation dose (not shown here)\ndespite the significant change in resistance. The inset of\nFigure 3 shows that the MR data at temperatures higher\nthan 50K obey Kohler's rule [25]; namely, \u2206\u03c1/\u03c1 scales\nwith H/\u03c1, implying it is a function of H\u03c4 alone (where\nH is the magnetic field and \u03c4 is the scattering time).\nThat the MR does not change between different relaxation times or different irradiation times suggests that\nthe scattering time is practically unchanged.\n\n\f3\n20\n\nIn passing, we also note that, the MR bellow 50K does\nnot obey Kohler's rule and the angular dependance is\ndifferent, indicating that the mechanism of the MR at\nlow temperatures is not the same as above 50K.\n\n6\n\n15\n\nMR (%)\n\n5\n4\n3\n\nMR [%]\n\n2\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nH/R (Oe/ )\n\n5\n\n0\n-8 104\n\n-4 104\n\n0\nH (Oe)\n\n4 104\n\n8 104\n\nFIG. 3: Magnetoresistance of Ar+ irradiated SrTiO3 at 50K\n(diamonds) 80K (squares) and 100K (circles) measured after\ntwo different relaxation times (full and empty symbols).

Koster, H. Yamamoto, W. A. Harrison,\n\nThe linear relation between sheet resistances with different doses of irradiation and the linear relation between\nsheet resistances measured after different waiting times,\nindicate that the qualitative behavior of the resistivity\ndoes not change in a detectable way. Together with the\nfact that the mobility and the scattering time do not\nchange when the sheet resistance changes, it may suggest\nthat the diffusion of the oxygen vacancies decreases the\nnumber of charge carriers while hardly affecting the scattering rate of the remaining charge carriers. It remains to\nbe checked how this observation is correlated with time\ndependent variation in the thickness of the conducting\nlayer and the spatial variation of charge carriers density\nwithin this layer. Answers to these questions are important for the potential use of electron-doped SrTiO3 in\nfuture oxide electronics.\nL.K. acknowledges support by the Israel Science Foundation founded by the Israel Academy of Science and\nHumanities.\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\nT.
