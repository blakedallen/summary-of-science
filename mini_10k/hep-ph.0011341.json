Goloskokov\nBogoliubov Laboratory of Theoretical Physics, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna\n141980, Moscow region, Russia\n\nAbstract. We study spin asymmetries in diffractive QQ\u0304 and vector meson production\nwhich are sensitive to the spin-dependent part of the two-gluon-nucleon coupling. It\nis found that the All and AlT asymmetry in diffractive reactions can be used to study\npolarized gluon distributions of the proton.\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nInvestigation of the structure of hadrons, is a problem of considerable interest\nnow. The inclusive reaction can be used to study ordinary parton distributions.\nHowever, it is difficult to distinguish events with a single outgoing proton or jet in\na fixed target experiment like COMPASS [1]. In this case, at small x the diffractive\nevents will contribute together with nondiffractive one. The measured asymmetry\ncan be written in the form\nAexp =\n\n\u2206\u03c3N D + \u2206\u03c3D\n\u03c3D\n= A(1 \u2212 R) + AD R, R =\n.\n\u03c3N D + \u03c3D\n\u03c3N D + \u03c3D\n\n(1)\n\nHere A = \u2206\u03c3N D /\u03c3N D and AD = \u2206\u03c3D /\u03c3D . It can be shown that the ratio R should\nincrease with x \u2192 0. The integrated over x R ratio has been found at HERA\nto be about 20\u201330% [2]. This means that diffractive events might be important\nin extraction of asymmetry at small x from experiment. The diffractive hadron\nphotoproduction can be expressed in terms of skewed parton distribution (SPD)\nin the nucleon F\u03b6 (x) [3]. Investigation of such diffractive reactions should play\na keystone role in future study Fx (x) at small x. In the diffractive charm quark\nproduction including J/\u03a8 reactions, the predominant contribution is determined\nby the two-gluon exchange (gluon SPD). Analysis of these reactions should throw\nlight on the gluon structure of the proton at small x [4,5].\nTo study spin effects in the diffractive hadron production, one must know the\nstructure of the two-gluon coupling with the proton at small x. The QCD\u2013inspired\ndiquark model generates the spin-dependent ggp coupling [6] of the following form:\n\n\f\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1\u03b1\nVpgg\n(p, t, xP , l\u22a5 ) = (\u03b3 \u03b1 p\u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03b1 p\u03b1 )B(t, xP , l\u22a5 ) + 4p\u03b1 p\u03b1 A(t, xP , l\u22a5 )\n\n+ \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\u03c1 p\u03b4 \u03b3\u03c1 \u03b35 D(t, xP , l\u22a5 ).\n\n(2)\n\nThe first two terms of the vertex (2) are symmetric over \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 indices. The structure\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(\u03b3 \u03b1 p\u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03b1 p\u03b1 )B(t) in (2) determines the spin-non-flip contribution. The term\np\u03b1 p\u03b1\u2032 A(r) leads to the transverse spin-flip in the vertex which does not vanish in\nthe s \u2192 \u221e limit. The single spin transverse asymmetry predicted in the models\n[6,7] is about 10% for |t| \u223c 3GeV2 which is of the same order of magnitude as\nhas been observed experimentally [8]. These model approaches give for the ratio\n\u03b1 = A/B \u2264 0.1GeV\u22121\nThe asymmetric structure in (2) is proportional to D\u03b3\u03c1 \u03b35 and can be associated\nwith \u2206G. It should give a visible contribution to the double spin longitudinal\nasymmetry All [9]. The value of this structure is not well known now from our\nmodel estimations.\nIn this report, we shall analyze spin effects caused by the structures A and B. It\nwill be shown here that such effects will be small in the All asymmetry. The double\nspin asymmetry for a longitudinally polarized lepton and a transversely polarized\nproton is predicted to be not small and mainly determined by the A term in (2).\nSuch asymmetry should be used to study this structure in the ggp coupling.\n\nII\n\nDIFFRACTIVE HADRON PRODUCTION AND SPD\n\nLet us study the diffractive J/\u03a8 production at high energies and fixed momentum\ntransfer. The fractions of the momenta of proton carried by the Pomeron, xP \u223c\n(m2J + Q2 + |t|)/W 2 is small at high energies. The \u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 J/\u03a8 transition amplitude\nis described by a nonrelativistic wave function [4,10]. Gluons from the Pomeron\nare coupled with the single and different quarks in the cc\u0304 loop. The spin-average\nand spin dependent cross sections of the J/\u03a8 leptoproduction with parallel and\nantiparallel longitudinal polarization of a lepton and a proton are determined by\nthe relation\nd\u03c3(\u00b1)\n1\n|T \u00b1 |2\n\u2192\n\u2192\n=\n(d\u03c3(\n)\n\u00b1\nd\u03c3(\n))\n=\n..\n\u21d0\n\u21d2\ndQ2 dydt\n2\n32(2\u03c0)3 Q2 s2 y\n\n(3)\n\nFor the spin-average amplitude square we find [11]\n\u0010\n\n|T + |2 = s2 N (2 \u2212 2y + y 2 )m2J + 2(1 \u2212 y)Q2\n\n\u0011h\n\ni\n\n|B\u0303 + 2m\u00c3|2 + |\u00c3|2 |t| .\n\n(4)\n\nHere the term proportional to (2 \u2212 2y + y 2)m2J represents the contribution of the\nvirtual photon with transverse polarization. The 2(1 \u2212 y)Q2 term describes the\neffect of longitudinal photons. The N factor in (4) is normalization, and the \u00c3 and\nB\u0303 functions are expressed through the integral over transverse momentum of the\ngluon. The function B\u0303 is determined by\n\n\f2\n2\n~\nd2 l\u22a5 (l\u22a5\n+ ~l\u22a5 \u2206)B(l\n\u22a5 , xP , ...)\n2\n~ 2 + \u03bb2 )[l2 + ~l\u22a5 \u2206\n~ + Q\u03042 ]\n(l\u22a5\n+ \u03bb2 )((~l\u22a5 + \u2206)\n\u22a5\nZ l2 <Q\u03042\n2\n~\n1\n1\nd2 l\u22a5 (l\u22a5\n+ ~l\u22a5 \u2206)\n\u22a5\n2\nB(l\n,\nx\n)\n=\n\u223c\nF g (xP , t, Q\u03042 ).\nP\n\u22a5\n4 xP\n2\n2\n2\n2\n~\n~\n4Q\u03044 0\n4\nQ\u0304\n(l\u22a5 + \u03bb )((l\u22a5 + \u2206) + \u03bb )\n\nB\u0303 =\n\n1\n4Q\u03042\n\nZ\n\n(5)\n\nand connected with the gluon SPD [12]. Here Q\u03042 = (m2J + Q2 + |t|)/4. The\n\u00c3 function is determined by the similar integral. The spin-dependent amplitude\nsquare looks like\nh\n\ni\n\n|T \u2212 |2 = s|t|(2 \u2212 y)N |B\u0303|2 + m(\u00c3\u22c6 B\u0303 + \u00c3B\u0303 \u22c6 ) m2J .\n\n(6)\n\nThe asymmetry All = \u03c3(\u2212)/\u03c3(+) depends on the ratio of the spin-flip to the\nnon-flip parts of the coupling (2) \u03b1f lip = \u00c3(t)/B\u0303(t) which has been found to be\nabout 0.1. The predicted asymmetry at HERMES energies is shown in Fig. 1. The\ncontribution of the spin-dependent A term in (2) to the double spin All asymmetry\nof the J/\u03a8 production does not exceed two per cent for the momentum transfer\n|t| \u2264 1GeV2 . Sensitivity of the asymmetry to \u03b1 is rather weak. At HERA energies,\nthe asymmetry will be negligible.\nFor the diffractive QQ\u0304 leptoproduction the spin-average and spin-dependent cross\nsection can be written in the form\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd5 \u03c3(\u00b1)\n(2\u22122y+y 2 ) C(xP , Q ) N(\u00b1)\nq\n=\n.\n(2\u2212y)\n2\ndQ2 dydxP dtdk\u22a5\n1 \u2212 4k 2 \u03b2/Q2\n\n(7)\n\n\u22a5\n\nHere C(xP , Q2 ) is a normalization function which is common for the spin average\nand spin dependent cross section. The N(\u00b1) functions are expressed through the\n\nAsymmetry(%)\n\n\u0014\u0013\n\n\u0018\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n|t|GeV\n\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\nFIGURE 1. The All asymmetry of the J/\u03a8 production at HERMES: solid line -for \u03b1f lip = 0;\ndot-dashed line -for \u03b1f lip = \u22120.1; dashed line -for \u03b1f lip = 0.1\n\n\fFIGURE 2. The predicted Q2 dependence of the AlT asymmetry for the cc\u0304 production at\nCOMPASS for \u03b1 = 0.1GeV\u22121 , xP =0.1, y=0.5\n\nsame skewed gluon distributions FxgP (xP , t, Q\u030421 ) as for vector meson production\n2\nbut at a different scale Q21 = m2Q + k\u22a5\n(k is a quark momentum). Note that xP\nis not fixed in this reaction and usually xP \u2264 0.1 The predicted asymmetry is\nquite small and does not exceed 1%. It has a week dependence on the \u03b1 = \u00c3/B\u0303\nratio. Moreover, the All asymmetry is predicted to vanish for Q2 \u2192 0 as All \u221d\nQ2 /(Q2 + Q20 ) with Q20 \u223c 1GeV2 .\nThe A structure in (2) should contribute to the AlT asymmetry with longitudinal\nlepton and transverse proton polarization. The calculation of this asymmetry is\nsimilar to the analysis of All , which has been carried out before. It has been found\nthat the AlT asymmetry is not small and proportional to the \u03b1 = \u00c3/B\u0303 ratio. The\nAlT asymmetry is proportional to the scalar production of the proton spin vector,\nand the jet momentum AlT \u221d (s\u22a5 * k\u22a5 ) \u221d cos(\u03c6Jet) and the asymmetry integrated\nover the azimuthal jet angle \u03c6Jet is zero. We have calculated the AlT asymmetry for\nthe case when the proton spin vector is perpendicular to the lepton scattering plane\nand the jet momentum is parallel to this spin vector. The predicted asymmetry is\nlarge and shown in Fig. 2. The reason for the large value of AlT is that we do not\nfind here a small coefficient xP as for the All asymmetry [13].\n\nIII\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the present report, the polarized cross section of the diffractive hadron leptoproduction at high energies has been studied. The two-gluon exchange model\nwith the spin-dependent gg-proton coupling (2) has been used. We consider all the\ngraphs where the gluons from the Pomeron couple to a different quark in the loop\nand to the single one. This provides a gauge-invariant scattering amplitude.\n\n\fOur calculations show that the contribution of the structure A in (2) to All is\nsmaller than 1-2%. Not small effects in the double spin All asymmetry should be\ndetermined by the \u2206G \u221d D\u03b3\u03c1 \u03b35 term of the vertex (2). The results obtained here\nshow that diffractive asymmetry in the QQ\u0304 production vanishes as Q2 \u2192 0. We\ncan conclude that most likely such effects do not provide additional problems in\nextracting \u2206G from the All asymmetry because the COMPASS experiment plans\nto study the open charm production at small Q2 [1].\nIt is shown that the gluon SPD FxgP (xP ) and connected with \u2206G distribution\nGxgP (xP ) at the small xP \u223c (m2V + Q2 )/W 2 can be studied from the double spin\nasymmetry in the vector meson photoproduction. The contributions of the quark\nSPDs are non-negligible for x of about 0.1 where the HERMES and COMPASS\nexperiments will operate. Thus, in the case of the \u03c6 production the strange quark\nSPD might be studied in addition to the gluon one.\nIt is found here that the AlT asymmetry of the diffractive heavy quark production\nis predicted to be not small, about 10-20%. It can give direct information about\nthe spin-dependent structure A in the ggp coupling. A similar contribution to AlT\nin the vector meson production vanishes because of the integration over k\u22a5 . The\nstructure, which is proportional to xp in the AlT asymmetry of the vector meson\nproduction will be studied later.\nWe can conclude that important information on the spin\u2013dependent SPD at\nsmall x can be obtained from double spin asymmetries in diffractive hadron photoproduction reactions .\nThe author is grateful to the Organizing Committee of SPIN2000 for financial\nsupport.
