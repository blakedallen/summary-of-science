However, AdS spacetime fails\nto be globally hyperbolic, so a classical field satisfying a hyperbolic wave\nequation on AdS spacetime need not have a well defined dynamics. Nevertheless, AdS spacetime is static, so the possible rules of dynamics for\na field satisfying a linear wave equation are constrained by our previous\ngeneral analysis-given in paper II-where it was shown that the possible\nchoices of dynamics correspond to choices of positive, self-adjoint extensions of a certain differential operator, A. In the present paper, we reduce\nthe analysis of electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in AdS\nspacetime to scalar wave equations. We then apply our general results\nto analyse the possible dynamics of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in AdS spacetime. In AdS spacetime, the freedom (if\nany) in choosing self-adjoint extensions of A corresponds to the freedom (if\nany) in choosing suitable boundary conditions at infinity, so our analysis\ndetermines all of the possible boundary conditions that can be imposed\nat infinity. In particular, we show that other boundary conditions besides\nthe Dirichlet and Neumann conditions may be possible, depending on the\n\n1\n\n\fvalue of the effective mass for scalar field perturbations, and depending on\nthe number of spacetime dimensions and type of mode for electromagnetic\nand gravitational perturbations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime1 has come to play a central role in a number of\ncontexts in theoretical physics [1], most prominently in the \"AdS-CFT\" correspondence [2, 3, 4] (see also e.g., [5] and references therein). Although AdS spacetime is maximally symmetric and geodesically complete, it admits no Cauchy\nsurface and thus provides a very simple but nontrivial example of a non-globallyhyperbolic spacetime. Consequently, it is far from obvious, a priori, that one can\ndefine a sensible, deterministic field dynamics in AdS spacetime, even for classical, linear fields: If a classical field satisfies a linear hyperbolic equation, then it is\nlocally uniquely determined by suitable initial data on a spacelike hypersurface;\nhowever, in order to guarantee that a solution corresponding to given initial data\nexists globally and is globally unique, it is essential that the spacetime be globally\nhyperbolic and that the data be specified on a Cauchy surface (see, e.g. [6]).\nFor the case of a scalar wave equation in AdS spacetime, it is clear that-\nat least for some values of mass and coupling to curvature-it is necessary to\nspecify boundary conditions at infinity in order to obtain a well posed, deterministic evolution law. This issue has been investigated by a number of authors\n(see, in particular, [7, 8, 9]) and some proposals-such as Dirichlet or Neumann\nconditions-have been made. However, it is far from obvious that the boundary\nconditions that have been proposed encompass all the possibilities for dynamical\nevolution laws in AdS spacetime. New dynamical evolution laws would provide\nnew \"bulk theories\" in AdS spacetime, and could be of interest in view of the\nAdS-CFT correspondence2 , among other reasons.\nThe purpose of this paper is to apply our general analysis of dynamics in static,\nnon-globally-hyperbolic spacetimes [16] to systematically determine all possible\nboundary conditions that can be imposed at infinity for scalar, electromagnetic,\nand gravitational perturbations of AdS spacetime. In our previous paper [16],\nwe proved that any dynamical evolution law for a scalar field in a static, stably\ncausal spacetime that (i) locally agrees with the wave equation, (ii) admits a\nsuitable conserved positive energy, (iii) is compatible with the time translation\n1\n\nIn this paper, by m-dimensional AdS spacetime of curvature radius l, we mean the universal\ncovering space of the hyperboloid composed of points whose squared distance from the origin\nis \u2212l2 in Rm+1 with a flat metric of signature \u2212 \u2212 +...+.\n2\nSome implications of different choices of boundary conditions for AdS-CFT correspondence\nhave been discussed in [10, 11]. In particular, it was pointed out that multi-trace deformation\nof a boundary quantum field theory can be incorporated in the AdS-CFT correspondence by\nusing a general boundary condition for the corresponding bulk field [12, 13] (see also [14, 15]\nand references therein).\n\n2\n\n\fand time reflection symmetries, and (iv) satisfies a certain convergence condition\nmust correspond to a prescription of the type first proposed in [17]. Consequently,\nthe general prescription for a dynamical evolution law for a scalar field in a static,\nstably causal spacetime arises as follows:\nLet (M, g\u03bc\u03bd ) be a stably causal (but not necessarily globally hyperbolic) spacetime which admits a hypersurface orthogonal timelike Killing vector field, t\u03bc ,\nwhose orbits are complete. Let \u03c6 be a scalar field on (M, g\u03bc\u03bd ) which satisfies the\nKlein-Gordon equation\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 m20 \u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u2207\u03bc being the derivative operator associated with the spacetime metric g\u03bc\u03bd .\nSince (M, g\u03bc\u03bd ) is static, the equation of motion (1) can be rewritten as\n\u22022\n\u03c6 = \u2212A\u03c6 ,\n\u2202t2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere t denotes the Killing parameter and\nA = \u2212V Di (V Di ) + m20 V 2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere V \u2261 (\u2212t\u03bc t\u03bc )1/2 and Di is the derivative operator compatible with the\ninduced metric defined on a spacelike hypersurface \u03a3 orthogonal to the orbits of\nt\u03bc .\nWe can view A as an operator (with domain C0\u221e (\u03a3)) on the Hilbert space,\nL2 (\u03a3, V \u22121 d\u03a3), of square integrable functions on \u03a3 with volume measure V \u22121 d\u03a3,\nwhere d\u03a3 denotes the natural volume element on \u03a3 arising from the induced\nmetric. Then, provided that m20 > 0, A is a positive, symmetric operator\non L2 (\u03a3, V \u22121 d\u03a3). Hence, A always admits at least one positive self-adjoint\nextension-namely, the Friedrichs extension, AF . Let AE denote any positive\nself-adjoint extension of A. For any initial data (\u03c60 , \u03c6\u03070 ) \u2208 L2 (\u03a3, V \u22121 d\u03a3) \u00d7\nL2 (\u03a3, V \u22121 d\u03a3), define \u03c6t by\n1/2\n\n\u22121/2\n\n\u03c6t = cos(AE t)\u03c60 + AE\n\n1/2\n\nsin(AE t)\u03c6\u03070 .\n\n(4)\n\nThen it was shown in [17] that whenever (\u03c60 , \u03c6\u03070 ) \u2208 C0\u221e (\u03a3)\u00d7C0\u221e (\u03a3), the quantity\n\u03c6t defines a smooth solution of eq. (1) on all of M. Furthermore, this solution\nagrees with the solution determined by the initial data (\u03c60 , \u03c6\u03070 ) within the domain of dependence of initial hypersurface \u03a3. In addition, these solutions have\na conserved, positive energy E = (\u03c6t , AE \u03c6t )L2 + (\u03c6\u0307t , \u03c6\u0307t )L2 , and satisfy properties\n(iii) and (iv) mentioned above.\nAs already stated, the main result proven in [16] was that the above prescription eq. (4) is the only possible way for defining dynamics, subject to requirements (i)-(iv). Hence, we have the following simple algorithm to systematically\ndetermine the possible boundary conditions at infinity for a scalar field in AdS\n3\n\n\fspacetime: (a) Write the equation of motion in the form (2), thereby identifying\nthe operator A, eq. (3). (b) Determine all of the positive, self-adjoint extensions,\nAE , of A. (c) Interpret the dynamics defined by eq. (4) in terms of boundary\nconditions at infinity. In the present paper, we shall carry out this procedure to\ncompletion.\nThe only property of A used in the above analysis is that it is a positive, symmetric, elliptic operator on a suitable L2 Hilbert space. Therefore, the analysis of\nscalar field dynamics given in [17] and [16] can be generalised straightforwardly\nto second order, linear, hyperbolic equations satisfied by arbitrary tensor fields\nprovided that in static spacetimes3 these equations can still be put in the general\nform of eq. (2), with A a positive, symmetric, elliptic operator. In particular, it\ncan be applied to Maxwell's equations and the linearised Einstein equation provided that these equations have been put in the form eq. (2). However, it is not\nstraightforward to put Maxwell's equations or the linearised Einstein equation in\nthe required form. For example, although Maxwell's equations for the vector potential, A\u03bc , in the Lorentz gauge have the desired second order, hyperbolic form,\nthe \"inner product\" needed to make the corresponding A symmetric is not positive definite, since it yields a negative contribution from the time component, A0 ,\nof A\u03bc . In Minkowski spacetime, one may set A0 = 0 by a further gauge choice,\nbut such a choice is not possible in a general curved spacetime. Similar remarks\napply to the linearised Einstein equation in the transverse traceless gauge.\nIn this paper, we shall analyse Maxwell's equations and the linearised Einstein equation in AdS spacetime by making use of the spherical symmetry of AdS\nspacetime to decompose the vector potential and metric perturbation into their\n\"scalar\", \"vector\", and \"tensor\" parts with respect to the rotation group. We\nwill then expand each part in the appropriate spherical harmonics and will reduce\nthe resulting equations to a collection of decoupled scalar wave equations in two\ndimensions, each of which is of the general form (2). In fact, we will show that\neach spherical harmonic component of the scalar wave equation (with arbitrary\nmass and curvature coupling), Maxwell's equation, and the linearised Einstein\nequation all take exactly the same general form, the only difference being the\nvalues of two parameters that appear in this equation. Therefore, we may determine the possible boundary conditions at infinity for scalar, electromagnetic,\nand gravitational perturbations of AdS spacetime by studying the self-adjoint\nextensions of a two parameter family of second order differential operators in one\nvariable.\nIn our analysis, we shall consider (n + 2)-dimensional AdS spacetime (M, g\u03bc\u03bd )\nfor all n > 1. (Our results also can be straightforwardly extended to n = 0 for\nthe case of a scalar field.) We will work in a globally defined coordinate system\n3\n\nThe prescription of [17] has recently been generalised to stationary spacetimes [18]. However, no uniqueness results similar to those of [16] are presently known for the stationary case.\n\n4\n\n\fin which the metric takes the form\nds2(n+2) =\n\n\u0001\nl2\n\u2212dt2 + dx2 + cos2 x\u03b3ij dz i dz j ,\n2\nsin x\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b3ij (z)dz i dz j is the metric of the n-dimensional round unit sphere S n and\nl denotes the curvature radius. The range of x is (0, \u03c0/2] and the conformal\nboundary is located at x = 0. The coordinate vector field \u2202/\u2202t is a globally\ntimelike, hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector field4 . By use of the spherical\nharmonic decomposition described in the previous paragraph, we will reduce the\nscalar wave equation, Maxwell's equation, and the linearised Einstein equation\nto wave equations in a 2-dimensional AdS spacetime\nds2 =\n\n\u0001\nl2\n\u2212dt2 + dx2 ,\n2\nsin x\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is just the space of orbits (O 2 , gab ) of (n + 2)-dimensional AdS spacetime\nunder the rotation group SO(n + 1).\nIn the next section, we will perform the spherical harmonic decomposition of\nthe equations of motion for scalar fields, electromagnetic fields and gravitational\nperturbations and show that they can be written in the form of a Klein-Gordon\nequation in 2-dimensional AdS spacetime. The analysis of self-adjoint extensions\nof the operator A appearing in this wave equation and the relation between selfadjoint extensions and boundary conditions at infinity are given in Section 3.\n\nNotation and conventions\nWe will generally follow the notation and conventions of [6]. However, in this paper we will make frequent use of the above noted fact that (n+2)-dimensional AdS\nspacetime, (M, g\u03bc\u03bd ), can be expressed as a warped product of an n-dimensional\nround unit sphere, (S n , \u03b3ij ), and a 2-dimensional AdS spacetime, (O 2, gab ). To\ndistinguish between tensors on these different spaces, we will use greek indices\nto denote tensors on M, we will use latin indices in the range a, b, . . . , h to denote tensors on O 2, and we will use latin indices in the range i, j, . . . , p to denote\n4\n\nThe analysis of dynamics in this paper will be performed with respect to this globally\ntimelike Killing field. There are other hypersurface orthogonal Killing fields in AdS spacetime\nthat are timelike in a region that includes at least a portion of infinity. We believe that an\nanalysis of dynamics with respect to these static Killing fields would give rise to precisely the\nsame choices of boundary conditions, but we have not fully investigated this issue.\nThere have arisen some interests in implications of the topology for the AdS-CFT correspondence [19, 20, 21]. The simplest situation can be obtained by considering a quotient of AdS\nspacetime by a certain discrete subgroup of the group of the AdS isometries. We believe that\nan analysis of dynamics in such a geometry parallels the present analysis performed in the\nuniversal covering space.\n\n5\n\n\ftensors on S n . When convenient, we will also use these indices to denote coordinates and coordinate components in these spaces. Thus, we may occasionally\nwrite equations like eq. (5) in the form\ng\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = gab (y)dy ady b + r 2 (y)\u03b3(z)ij dz i dz j ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere r \u2261 l cos x/ sin x.\nWe will denote the metric compatible derivative operators on (M, g\u03bc\u03bd ), (S n , \u03b3ij ),\nb a , respectively. In order to avoid introducing adand (O 2 , gab ) by \u2207\u03bc , Di , and \u2207\nditional notation, we will also use \u03b3ij and Di to denote the metric and derivative\noperator of the general Riemannian manifolds considered in the next section. In\na few instances, we will need to introduce the derivative operator associated with\nthe hypersurfaces, \u03a3, orthogonal to the static Killing field. In order to avoid\nintroducing additional notation, we will also use Di to denote this derivative\noperator (as we already did in eq. (3) above).\n\n2\n\nField equations in anti-de Sitter spacetime\n\nIn this section, we will analyse the equations of motion for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations of AdS spacetime. Our analysis will be\nbased on the decomposition of the modes of these fields into their scalar, vector,\nand tensor parts as well as the expansion of these parts in appropriate spherical harmonics. The desired general decomposition theorems are derived in the\nfirst subsection, and the spherical harmonic expansion is discussed in the second\nsubsection. The explicit form of the scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational\nperturbation equations in AdS spacetime are then derived in the final subsection.\nMost of the results of subsections 2.1 and 2.2 are well known and are given in\nmany references (see, e.g., [22, 23, 24]), but complete derivations/proofs have not\nusually been provided in these other references.\n\n2.1\n\nDecomposition of Vectors and Symmetric Tensors on\nCompact Manifolds\n\nWe begin by recalling some general results on elliptic operators on compact manifolds. Let (M, \u03b3ij ) be a compact Riemannian manifold. Let P be a differential\noperator of order m (with smooth coefficients) mapping tensor fields of type (k, l)\non M to tensor fields of the same type on M. Thus, P has the explicit form\nP = P i1 ...ik j1 ...jl m1 ...mk n1 ...nl p1 ...pm Dp1 . . . Dpm + lower order terms\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Di denotes the derivative operator associated with \u03b3ij . For each x \u2208 M\nand each covector ki at x, the symbol, \u03c3P (x, k), of P is defined as the following\nmap from tensors of type (k, l) at x to tensors of type (k, l) at x\n\u03c3P (x, k) = P i1 ...ik j1 ...jl m1 ...mk n1 ...nl p1 ...pm kp1 . . . kpm .\n6\n\n(9)\n\n\fThe operator P is said to be elliptic if the map \u03c3P (x, k) is invertible for all x \u2208 M\nand all ki 6= 0. A well known result (usually referred to as \"elliptic regularity\")\nstates the following: Let P be elliptic and let j be a smooth tensor field of type\n(k, l) (where here and in the following we will generally suppress all indices). Let\nu be a distributional tensor field of type (k, l) which satisfies the equation\nPu = j\n\n(10)\n\nin the distributional sense. Then u is smooth.\nWe can use the metric, \u03b3ij to define a natural L2 inner product on (complex)\ntensor fields of type (k, l) on M via\nZ\n(11)\nu\u2217i1 ...ik j1 ...jl wi1 ...ik j1 ...jl ,\n(u, w)L2 =\nM\n\nwhere the star denotes complex conjugation. (In this equation indices are raised\nand lowered with \u03b3ij and the integration is with respect to the volume element\nassociated with \u03b3ij .) We may view any differential operator, P , as an operator\non L2 , defined on the dense domain of smooth tensor fields. Now let P be an\nelliptic operator on M that is symmetric when viewed as an operator on L2 , i.e.,\nfor all smooth u and w\n(u, P w) = (P u, w) .\n\n(12)\n\nAs will be discussed further in subsection 3.1 below, the self-adjoint extensions\nof P are determined by the \"deficiency subspaces\", i.e., the vectors z\u00b1 in L2 that\nsatisfy\nP \u2217 z\u00b1 = \u00b1iz\u00b1 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere P \u2217 denotes the adjoint of P . However, eq. (13) implies that z\u00b1 satisfies\nthe equation (P \u2213 i)z\u00b1 = 0 in the distributional sense, so by elliptic regularity z\u00b1\nmust be smooth. Hence, z\u00b1 lies in the domain of P , and we may replace P \u2217 by P\nin eq. (13). Taking the inner product of this equation with z\u00b1 , we immediately\nobtain a contradiction unless z\u00b1 = 0. Consequently, the deficiency subspaces\nare always trivial, and any symmetric, elliptic operator on a compact manifold is\nalways essentially self-adjoint, i.e., it has a unique self-adjoint extension. Thus,\nthe usually difficult analysis of determining whether a symmetric operator admits\nself-adjoint extensions and of characterising the self-adjoint extensions that do\nexist (see section 3 below) is always trivial for elliptic operators on a compact\nmanifold.\nNow let P be any symmetric, elliptic operator on M that is bounded from\nbelow as an operator on L2 . By the previous remarks, P has a unique selfadjoint extension, which we shall also denote by P . The operator exp(\u2212sP ) can\n7\n\n\fbe then defined by the spectral theorem, and, for s > 0, it is a bounded selfadjoint operator. Since P exp(\u2212sP ) also is bounded operator on L2 , it follows\nthat exp(\u2212sP ) also is a bounded map from L2 into the mth Sobolev space, Hm\nof M, where m is the order of P . Since the embedding of Hm into L2 is a\ncompact map when M is compact (see, e.g., [25]), it follows that exp(\u2212sP ) is\na compact, self-adjoint operator on L2 . Hence, by the Hilbert-Schmidt theorem\n[26], it admits an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, with eigenvalues converging\nto zero. It follows immediately that P itself has a purely discrete spectrum, and\nthat all of the eigensubspaces of P are finite dimensional. Note also that by\nelliptic regularity, all eigenvectors of P are smooth tensor fields. Consequently,\nan equation of the form (10) will admit a solution if and only if j is orthogonal\nto kerP , where kerP is the subspace of solutions to P z = 0. Furthermore, if a\nsolution to (10) exists, it obviously is unique up to addition of vectors in kerP .\nAs already stated above, we have dim(kerP ) < \u221e.\nWe now are ready to state our two decomposition results. The first one is\nessentially a simple case of the Hodge decomposition theorem for differential\nforms.\nProposition 2.1: Let (M, \u03b3ij ) be a compact Riemannian manifold. Then any\ndual vector field, vi on M can be uniquely decomposed as\nvi = Vi + Di S\n\n(14)\n\nwhere D i Vi = 0. We refer to Vi and S, respectively, as the vector and scalar\ncomponents of vi .\nProof: If the decomposition exists, then S would have to satisfy\nD i Di S = D ivi .\n\n(15)\n\nSince P = \u2212D i Di is a positive elliptic operator, we can solve this equation for S\nif and only if the \"source term\" on the right side is orthogonal\nto kerP . However,\nR\nkerP consists of only constant functions and since M D i vi = 0, the source is\nindeed orthogonal to kerP . Hence, we obtain a solution S, which is unique up\nto the addition of a constant. We obtain the desired decomposition by defining\nVi = vi \u2212 Di S. This decomposition is clearly unique, since the only ambiguity in\nS is the addition of a constant, which does not affect the decomposition.\n2\nThe second proposition concerns the decomposition of symmetric, second rank\ntensor fields.\nProposition 2.2: Let (M, \u03b3ij ) be a compact Riemannian Einstein space, i.e.,\nRij = c\u03b3ij for some constant c. Then any second rank symmetric tensor field, tij\non M can be uniquely decomposed as\ntij = Tij\n+D(i Vj)\n8\n\n\f\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nm\n+ Di Dj \u2212 \u03b3ij D Dm S + \u03b3ij tm m ,\nn\nn\n\n(16)\n\nwhere D i Tij = 0, T i i = 0, and D i Vi = 0. We refer to Tij , Vi , and (S, tm m ),\nrespectively, as the tensor-, vector- and scalar-type components of tij .\nProof: We define\n1\n\u03b3ij tm m ,\nn\nJj \u2261 D i Jij ,\nJ \u2261 D i Ji = D i D j Jij .\n\nJij \u2261 tij \u2212\n\nConsider the equation\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nn\nn\nc W =\nJ.\nD Di +\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\ni\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nThis equation can be solved for W if and only if the source J is orthogonal to\nthe solutions to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\ni\nD Di +\nc U = 0.\n(21)\nn\u22121\nTaking the derivative of this equation and using Rij = c\u03b3ij , we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ni\nD Di +\nc Dj U = 0 .\nn\u22121\n\n(22)\n\nContracting with D j U and integrating over M, we find that any solution, U, to\neq. (21) must also satisfy\nDi Dj U \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b3ij D m Dm U = 0 .\nn\n\n(23)\n\ni.e., D i U must be a conformal Killing field. It is easily checked that any solution,\nU, to eq. (23) is automatically orthogonal to J, so Req. (20) always can be solved\nfor W . If c 6= 0, integration of eq. (20) yields M W = 0. If c = 0, then\nU = const\nR solves (21), so we can always choose the solution W to eq. (20) to\nsatisfy M W = 0. Therefore, in all cases, we can solve the equation\nD i Di S = W\n\n(24)\n\nto obtain S.\nNext, we consider the equation\nD i D(i Vj) = Jj \u2212\n\nn\u22121\nDj W \u2212 cDj S .\nn\n9\n\n(25)\n\n\fAgain, the left side is a symmetric elliptic operator on dual vector fields, so we\ncan solve eq. (25) provided that the right side is orthogonal to the kernel of this\noperator. However, it is easily seen that the kernel consists precisely of Killing\nvector fields and that the right side is orthogonal to any Killing vector field. Thus,\nwe can always solve eq. (25) to obtain Vj . Furthermore, taking the divergence of\neq. (25), we find\nD j D i D(i Vj) = J \u2212\n\nn\u22121 j\nD Dj W \u2212 cD j Dj S = 0\nn\n\n(26)\n\nand hence\n\u0001\nD i Di + c D j V j = 0 .\n\n(27)\n\nTaking the gradient of this equation, we find\n\n(D i Di )Dm (D j Vj ) = 0\n\n(28)\n\nwhich implies that Di Dm D j Vj = 0. In particular, Rwe have D i Di (D j Vj ) = 0,\nwhich implies that D j Vj is constant. However, since M D j Vj = 0, we obtain the\ndesired result that D j Vj = 0.\nHaving now defined S and Vj , we simply define Tij by eq. (16). It is then easily\nverified that T i i = 0 and that D i Tij = 0. Finally, uniqueness of the decomposition\nfollows from the fact that each of the 4 terms in eq. (16) are manifestly orthogonal\nin the L2 inner product. Consequently, if there were two distinct ways of writing\nthe decomposition (16) of tij , their difference would yield a formula for the zerovector, expressing it as the sum of 4 orthogonal vectors, not all of which are zero.\n2\nFinally, we note that compactness of M was used in the arguments of this\nsubsection in the following two essential ways: (1) to argue that any symmetric\nelliptic operator is essentially self-adjoint, and (2) to argue that the spectrum of\nany self-adjoint elliptic operator is discrete. The symmetric, elliptic operators\nconsidered in the above propositions will be essentially self-adjoint on many noncompact manifolds of interest, but their spectra typically will be continuous.\nConsequently, although analogous decomposition results should hold for many\nnon-compact manifolds, it will not be possible to give such a simple, general\nproof, i.e., the decomposition results for non-compact manifolds must be analysed\non a case-by-case basis.\n\n2.2\n\nSpherical Harmonic Decomposition on an n-Sphere\n\nProposition 2.1 of the previous subsection holds for arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds, and Proposition 2.2 holds for arbitrary compact Riemannian\nEinstein spaces. However, on general spaces, an operator of interest may \"mix\"\nthe various components of vectors and tensors, e.g., when acting on the purely\n10\n\n\f\"tensor part\" of a symmetric rank-two tensor field, the resulting tensor field could\nhave scalar and vector components. However, we shall see below that such \"mixing\" cannot occur on the (round) n-sphere for any operator that is rotationally\ninvariant (and, in the case of the 2-sphere, also parity invariant). Consequently,\nthe decompositions of the previous subsection are particularly useful in this case,\nsince one can then analyse the scalar, vector, and tensor components separately.\nThe purpose of this subsection is to establish this result as well as to introduce\nthe spherical harmonic expansion of each component.\nLet \u03b3ij be the round metric on the n-sphere, S n . Then (S n , \u03b3ij ) is an Einstein\nspace with c = n \u2212 1, so, in particular, Proposition 2.2 applies. Consider, first,\nthe scalar spherical harmonics. The rotation group SO(n + 1) acts naturally\non the Hilbert space L2S of square integrable functions f : S n \u2192 C. Since the\nLaplacian, D i Di , is invariant under rotations, each eigensubspace of D i Di must\nalso be invariant under rotations. The scalar spherical harmonics, SkS are defined\nto be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of D i Di , i.e.,\n\u0001\nD i Di + kS2 SkS = 0 ,\n(29)\nand\n\nZ\n\nSn\n\nSkS Sk\u2032 S = \u03b4kS ,k\u2032 S .\n\n(30)\n\nAn explicit choice of SkS can be found in e.g., [27] and references therein. The\neigenvalues kS2 appearing in eq. (29) are kS2 = l(l + n \u2212 1), l = 0, 1, 2, . . ..\nThe rotation group also acts naturally on the Hilbert space of square integrable vector fields on S n . In addition, it is easily seen that rotations map the\nHilbert subspace, L2V , of divergence-free vector fields into itself. Furthermore,\nit is easily checked that the Laplacian, D i Di , also maps L2V into itself. Vector\nspherical harmonics, VkV i , are defined to be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors\nof D i Di in L2V , i.e., they satisfy\n(D j Dj + kV2 )VkV i = 0 ,\n\nD i V kV i = 0 ,\n\n(31)\n\nand\nZ\n\nSn\n\nVkV i Vk\u2032 V i = \u03b4kV ,k\u2032 V .\n\n(32)\n\nAn explicit choice of VkV i can be found in e.g., [27] and references therein. The\neigenvalues kV2 appearing in eq. (32) are kV2 = l(l + n \u2212 1) \u2212 1, l = 1, 2, . . .. The\nnumber of the independent components of VkV i is (n \u2212 1), so vector spherical\nharmonics are nontrivial only when n > 2.\nFinally, the rotation group also acts naturally on the Hilbert space of square\nintegrable rank-two symmetric tensor fields on S n . In addition, it is easily seen\n11\n\n\fthat it maps the Hilbert subspace, L2T , of trace-free, divergence-free symmetric\ntensor fields into itself. Furthermore, it is easily checked that the Laplacian,\nD i Di , also maps L2T into itself. Tensor spherical harmonics, TkT ij are defined to\nbe an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of D i Di in L2T , i.e., they satisfy\n(D m Dm + kT2 )TkT ij = 0 ,\n\nDj TkT j i = 0 ,\n\nTkT i i = 0 ,\n\n(33)\n\nand\nZ\n\nSn\n\nTkT ij Tk\u2032 T ij = \u03b4kT ,k\u2032 T .\n\n(34)\n\nAn explicit choice of TkT ij can be found in Ref. [27]. The eigenvalues kT2 appearing in eq. (33) are kT2 = l(l + n \u2212 1) \u2212 2, l = 2, 3, . . .. The number of the\nindependent components of TkT ij is (n \u2212 2)(n + 1)/2, so, in particular, tensor\nspherical harmonics are nontrivial only when n > 3.\nThe \"total squared angular momentum\", J 2 , is the Casimir element of the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of SO(n+1) obtained by summing\nthe squares of the elements of an orthonormal basis, {\u03be(\u03b1) }, of the Lie algebra.\nFor tensor fields on S n , the action of J 2 is obtained by replacing each \u03be(\u03b1) by the\nLie derivative with respect to the corresponding Killing vector field on S n . The\naction of J 2 on scalar functions on S n is thereby computed to be simply\nJS2 = \u2212D i Di .\n\n(35)\n\nSimilarly, the action of J 2 on dual vector fields and on rank-two symmetric tensor\nfields on S n are, respectively,\n(JV2 )i j = \u2212(D m Dm \u2212 (n \u2212 1))\u03b4i j ,\n\n(36)\n\n(JT2 )ij kl = \u2212(D m Dm \u2212 2n)\u03b4i k \u03b4j l \u2212 2\u03b3ij \u03b3 kl .\n\n(37)\n\nand\n\nConsequently, for scalar spherical harmonics of order l, J 2 takes the value l(l +\nn \u2212 1); for vector spherical harmonics of order l, J 2 takes the value l(l + n \u2212\n1) + (n \u2212 2); and for tensor spherical harmonics of order l, J 2 takes the value\nl(l + n \u2212 1) + 2(n \u2212 1). By inspection, the values of J 2 for scalar, vector, and\ntensor harmonics never are equal, except for the case n = 2, when the values of\nJ 2 for scalar and vector spherical harmonics agree for all l. Thus-except in the\ncase n = 2-the scalar, vector, and tensor harmonics always span inequivalent\nrepresentations of the rotation group. This implies that there cannot exist any\n(nonzero) rotationally invariant map between any pair of the spaces L2T and\nL2V and L2S -with the exception of the case n = 2, where there could exist a\nrotationally invariant map between L2V and L2S (see below). In particular, this\n12\n\n\fmeans that any rotationally invariant operator on rank-two symmetric tensor\nfields on S n cannot take the tensor component into a nonzero vector or scalar\ncomponent; it cannot take the vector component into a nonzero tensor component\nor (if n > 2) a nonzero scalar component; nor can it take the scalar component\ninto a nonzero tensor component or (if n > 2) a non-zero vector component.\nWhen n = 2 the scalar and vector harmonics span equivalent representations\nof SO(3) and, indeed, the vector harmonics can be chosen to be\nVki \u2261 \u01ebij D j Sk ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u01ebij is the (positively oriented) volume element on S 2 associated with \u03b3ij .\nThus, one sees explicitly that there exist nonvanishing SO(3)-invariant maps between L2V and L2S . However, as can be seen from eq. (38), the vector and scalar\nharmonics behave differently under parity, and thus span inequivalent representations of O(3). (The scalar representations of O(3) are said to be of \"polar\" (or\n\"even parity\") type, and the vector representations are said to be of \"axial\" (or\n\"odd parity\") type.) Consequently, even when n = 2, no rotationally and parity\ninvariant operator can \"mix\" the scalar and vector components of a vector field\nor symmetric, rank-two tensor field.\n\n2.3\n\nScalar fields on AdS Spacetime\n\nWe now turn our attention to the derivation of the desired form of the field equations for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations of AdS spacetime. As previously noted, the metric (5) of (n + 2)-dimensional AdS spacetime\ntakes the form of a warped product of an n-dimensional base space (S n , \u03b3ij ) and\na 2-dimensional space of orbits (O 2 , gab ):\nds2(n+2) = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = gab (y)dy ady b + r 2 (y)\u03b3(z)ij dz i dz j ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u03b3ij is the round, unit sphere metric on S n , and\nr\u2261l\n\ncos x\n.\nsin x\n\n(40)\n\nIn the coordinates (t, r) the metric of the space of orbits takes the form\ngab (y)dy ady b = \u2212V 2 l2 dt2 +\n\ndr 2\n,\nV2\n\nV2 =1+\n\nr2\n.\nl2\n\n(41)\n\nOur general strategy will be to project all tensor fields into parts that are tangent\nand orthogonal to S n , to decompose all tensor fields on S n into their scalar, vector,\nand tensor components, and to expand each component on S n in the appropriate\nspherical harmonics.\nTo avoid confusion when comparing with other analyses, it should be emphasised that our analysis involves an \"n+2\" decomposition of AdS spacetime rather\n13\n\n\fthan an \"(n + 1) + 1\" decomposition. Thus, for example, our notion of the scalar,\nvector, and tensor components of a metric perturbation are defined with respect\nto the action of the isometry subgroup SO(n + 1), whose orbits are n-spheres.\nIt would also be possible to write AdS spacetime as a Robertson-Walker spacetime and decompose tensors with respect to the isometry subgroup acting on the\n(n + 1)-dimensional surfaces of homogeneity and isotropy in the manner done,\ne.g., in [22, 23]. This would give rise to completely different notions of the scalar,\nvector, and tensor components of a metric perturbation.\nThe simplest case is that of a Klein-Gordon scalar field, \u03c6, where no projections are necessary. We expand \u03c6 in terms of scalar spherical harmonics Sk (z i )\nX\n\u03a6k (t, r)Sk (z i ) .\n(42)\n\u03c6(t, x, z i ) \u2261 r \u2212n/2\nkS\n\nThe equation of motion for each \u03a6k (t, r) is obtained by straightforward substitution into (1).

The resultant\n17\n\n\fequations are equivalent to those given in [29] in maximally symmetric backgrounds and those in [24, 30] in more general backgrounds.\nGravitational perturbations are described by a symmetric tensor field h\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd on the background AdS spacetime. We may project h\u03bc\u03bd relative to S n as\nh\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = hab dy a dy b + 2hai dy adz i + hij dz i dz j .\n\n(71)\n\nThe projection, hab , orthogonal to S n in both indices is purely scalar with respect\nto rotations. The orthogonal-tangent projection, hai , and the tangent-tangent\nprojection hij can be further decomposed into their scalar, vector, and tensor\nparts as\nhai = Di ha + h(1) ai ,\nhij = h(2) ij\n(1)\n\n+2D(i hT\n\n(72)\n\nj)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\n(0)\nm\n+hL \u03b3ij + Di Dj \u2212 \u03b3ij D Dm hT ,\nn\n\nwith\n\nD j h(2) ij = h(2)i i = 0 ,\ni (1)\n\nDh\n\nai\n\n= 0,\n\n(73)\n\n(74)\n\n(1)\nD i hT i\n\n= 0.\n\n(75)\n(1)\n(h(1) ai , hT j ),\n\nThus, the tensor part of h\u03bc\u03bd is h(2) ij , the vector part of h\u03bc\u03bd consists of\n(0)\nand the scalar component of h\u03bc\u03bd consists of (hab , hL , hT ). Each tensorial component decouples from the others and can be expanded in the appropriate tensor\nharmonics, namely TkT ij , VkV i , and SkS , respectively.\nTensor-type perturbation\nWe expand the tensor-type perturbation in spherical harmonics as,\nX (2)\nHT k * Tkij ,\nh(2) ij =\n\n(76)\n\nkT\n\n(2)\n\nwith HT being a function on (O 2 , gab ).

Using these explicit forms of Esol and \u03c60 , we\nsee that under the change (118), E(\u03c6S ) transforms as\nE(\u03c6S ) \u2192 E(\u03c6S + \u03c60 )\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr2\nr2\n= Esol \u2212\n\u2212 n)\u03c60 + n 2 \u03c60 \u2212 nr 1 + 2 \u2202r \u03c60\nl\nl\n2\n\u2032\n= Esol \u2212 (kS \u2212 n)\u03c60 \u2212 nc1 r\n= c\u2032\u20321 r + V (c\u2032\u20322 sin t + c\u2032\u20323 cos t) ,\n(kS2\n\n23\n\n(123)\n\n\fwhere c\u2032\u20321 = c1 \u2212 kS2 c\u20321 c\u2032\u20322 = c2 \u2212 (kS2 \u2212 n)c\u20322 c\u2032\u20323 = c3 \u2212 (kS2 \u2212 n)c\u20323 . Thus, setting these\narbitrary constants c\u2032\u20321 , c\u2032\u20322 , c\u2032\u20323 zero, we can make E(\u03c6S + \u03c60 ) vanish. Therefore,\nfrom eq.

(45).\nThus, we have reduced the problem of solving the gravitational perturbation\nequations to solving the 3 scalar equations (78), (89), and (124) for \u03a6T , \u03a6V , and\n\u03a6S , respectively. Note that the vector- and scalar-type gravitational perturbations in 4-dimensions (i.e., n = 2), and scalar-type perturbations in 6-dimensions\n(i.e., n = 4) satisfy the same equation as a conformally invariant scalar field,\nwhile in all dimensions the tensor-type gravitational perturbations satisfy the\nsame equation as a minimally coupled massless scalar field.\nFinally, we note that the tensor spherical harmonics have (n \u2212 2)(n + 1)/2\nindependent components, the vector spherical harmonics have (n\u22121) independent\ncomponents, and the scalar spherical harmonics have 1 independent component.\nThus, the total number of independent components is (n + 2)(n \u2212 1)/2, which\ncorresponds to the number of dynamical degrees of freedom for gravitational\nradiation in an (n + 2)-dimensional spacetime.\n\n3\n\nDynamics in anti-de Sitter spacetime\n\nWe have seen that the field equations for scalar fields, electromagnetic fields and\ngravitational perturbations can be reduced to a wave equation of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u22022\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 1/4 \u03c3 2 \u2212 1/4\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u03a6,\n(126)\n\u03a6=\n\u2212\n\u2202t2\n\u2202x2\ncos2 x\nsin2 x\nwhich is defined on the interval (0, \u03c0/2), where x = \u03c0/2 corresponds to the origin\nof spherical coordinates and x = 0 corresponds to infinity in AdS spacetime. In\nall cases, \u03c3 takes the value (see eq. (45))\n\u03c3=l+\n\nn\u22121\n.\n2\n\n(127)\n\nOn the other hand, the value of \u03bd 2 depends upon the field and the type (i.e., scalar,\nvector, or tensor) of perturbation. For scalar fields, \u03bd 2 can take any (positive or\n24\n\n\fnegative) value, depending on the value of the effective mass, m2 \u2261 m20 + \u03beR, of\nthe scalar field. For the electromagnetic and gravitational cases, the values of \u03bd 2\nare given by eqs. (56), (70), (79), (90), and (125) above. In this section, we will\ndetermine all of the possible boundary conditions that can be imposed at infinity\n(x = 0) so as to yield sensible dynamics for this equation.\n\n3.1\n\nThe operator A and its properties\n\nThe general prescription of [17] for defining dynamics (see section 1 above) corresponds to viewing the differential operator\nA\u2261\u2212\n\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 1/4 \u03c3 2 \u2212 1/4\nd2\n+\n+\n,\ndx2\ncos2 x\nsin2 x\n\n(128)\n\nappearing in eq. (126) as an operator on the Hilbert space H = L2 ([0, \u03c0/2], dx).\nIndeed, taking account of the field redefinition (42), it is easily seen that for each\nspherical harmonic, the inner product for \u03c6(t, x, z i ) in L2 (\u03a3, V \u22121 d\u03a3) corresponds\nto the inner product for \u03a6(t, x) defined on H, i.e.,\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c8 \u03c6V\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03a3 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03a8\u2217 \u03a6 dx .\n\n(129)\n\n0\n\nIt is easily seen that, when defined on the natural domain C0\u221e (0, \u03c0/2), A is a\nsymmetric operator. For later purposes, it will be useful to classify A according\nto the possible values of \u03bd 2 as follows:\nCase (i): \u03bd 2 > 1. This case occurs for scalar fields whose effective mass squared\nsatisfies m2 > \u2212(n + 3)(n \u2212 1)/4l2 . In particular, this case encompasses the minimally coupled massless scalar field in all dimensions. This case also encompasses\nthe tensor-type of gravitational perturbations in all dimensions where they are\ndefined (namely spacetime dimensions greater than or equal to 5, i.e., n > 3),\nthe vector-type of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in spacetime\ndimensions greater than or equal to 5 (i.e., n > 3), and the scalar-type of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in spacetime dimensions greater than\nor equal to 7 (i.e., n > 5).\nCase (ii): 0 < \u03bd 2 < 1. This case occurs for scalar fields whose effective mass is in\nthe range \u2212(n + 1)2 /4l2 < m2 < \u2212(n + 3)(n \u2212 1)/4l2 . (Note that in 4 spacetime\ndimensions, this relation becomes \u22129/4l2 < m2 < \u22125/4l2 , which corresponds to\nthe case analysed by Breitenlohner and Freedman [8, 9].) In particular, this case\nencompasses the conformally invariant scalar field in all spacetime dimensions.\nThis case also encompasses the vector-type of electromagnetic and gravitational\nperturbations in 4-spacetime dimensions (i.e., n = 2), and the scalar-type of\nelectromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in 4- and 6-spacetime dimensions\n(i.e., n = 2, 4).\n25\n\n\fCase (iii): \u03bd 2 = 0. This case occurs for a scalar field whose effective mass\nsquared takes the critical value m2C \u2261 \u2212(n + 1)2 /4l2. It also occurs for scalartype of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in 5-dimensional (i.e.,\nn = 3) AdS spacetime.\nCase (iv): \u03bd 2 < 0. This case occurs only for a scalar field whose effective mass\nsatisfies m2 < \u2212(n + 1)2 /4l2 .\nThe positivity properties of A are governed by the following proposition:\n\nProposition 3.1: If \u03bd 2 > 0 (i.e., in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) above), then A is a\npositive operator. On the other hand, if \u03bd 2 < 0 (i.e., in case (iv) above) then A\nis unbounded below.\nProof: Consider, first, the case \u03bd 2 > 0. Let \u03bd denote the positive square root of\n\u03bd 2 and write\nG\u03bd (x) \u2261 (cos x)\u03c3+1/2 * (sin x)\u2212\u03bd+1/2 .\n\n(130)\n\nWe define the operators D\u0303 \u00b1 by\nD\u0303 \u00b1 \u2261 \u00b1\n\nd\ndG\u03bd\n\u2212 G\u03bd \u22121\n,\ndx\ndx\n\n(131)\n\nThen A can be expressed as\nA = D\u0303 \u2212 D\u0303 + + (\u2212\u03bd + \u03c3 + 1)2 .\nFor arbitrary \u03a6 \u2208 Dom(A) = C0\u221e (0, \u03c0/2), it is then easily seen that\nZ \u03c0/2\nZ \u03c0/2\n2\n2\n(\u03a6, A\u03a6)L2 = (\u2212\u03bd + \u03c3 + 1)\n|\u03a6| dx +\n|D\u0303 + \u03a6|2 dx ,\n0\n\n(132)\n\n(133)\n\n0\n\nwhich establishes the positivity of A.\nNext, we consider the case \u03bd 2 < 0. Let f be the C 1 function\n\u001a\n(sin x)2 \b\n0<x6\u03b7\n,\nf (x) \u2261\n(cos x)2 p(sin x)1/2 + q(sin x)\u22121/2\n\u03b7 < x 6 \u03c0/2\n\n(134)\n\nwhere 0 < \u03b7 < \u03c0/2 and\np=\n\n(sin \u03b7)3/2 {4 + (cos \u03b7)2 }\n,\n2(cos \u03b7)4\n\nq=\n\n(sin \u03b7)5/2 {\u22124 + (cos \u03b7)2 }\n.\n2(cos \u03b7)4\n\nStraightforward calculation shows that for small \u03b7,\n\u0013\n\u001e Z \u03c0/2\nZ \u03c0/2 \u0012\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 1/4 \u03c3 2 \u2212 1/4\n\u22022\nf dx\n|f |2 dx\n+\nf \u2212 2+\n2\n2x\n\u2202x\ncos\nsin\nx\n0\n0\n= \u22125\u03bd 2 log \u03b7 + C + O(\u03b7) ,\n26\n\n(135)\n\n(136)\n\n\fwhere C is a constant independent of \u03b7. Hence, for \u03bd 2 < 0, by taking \u03b7 \u2192 0,\nthe right hand side of eq. (136) can be made to take arbitrarily large negative values. However, this does not yet prove the desired result, since f \u2208\n/\n\u221e\nDom(A) = C0 (0, \u03c0/2). To remedy this, we smooth f as follows. Let \u03c7 be\nan arbitrary\nsmooth function with support contained within (\u2212\u03c0/4, \u03c0/4) satisfyR\ning \u03c7(x)dx = 1. Define \u03c7\u01eb (x) = \u01eb\u22121 \u03c7(x/\u01eb) (so that \u03c7\u01eb approaches a \u03b4-function\nas \u01eb \u2192 0) and define\nZ\nf\u01eb (x) \u2261 \u03c7\u01eb (x \u2212 x\u2032 )f (\u2212\u01eb + (1 + \u01eb)x\u2032 )dx\u2032 ,\n(137)\nwhere we have extended the domain of definition of f beyond [0, \u03c0/2] by setting\nf (x) = 0 whenever x \u2208\n/ [0, \u03c0/2]. Then, for sufficiently small \u01eb, we have f\u01eb \u2208\nC0\u221e (0, \u03c0/2) = Dom(A), so formula (133) holds. However, since f is C 1 and goes\nto zero sufficiently rapidly at x = 0, \u03c0/2, it is straightforward to check that as\n\u01eb \u2192 0, f\u01eb and D\u0303 + f\u01eb converge uniformly on [0, \u03c0/2] to f and D\u0303 + f , respectively.\nIt then follows that (f\u01eb , Af\u01eb )L2 /kf\u01eb k2L2 converges to the left side of eq. (136) as\n\u01eb \u2192 0. Consequently, there exist \u03a8 \u2208 Dom(A) such that (\u03a8, A\u03a8)L2 /k\u03a8k2L2 takes\narbitrarily large negative values.\n2\nThus, in case (iv), no positive, self-adjoint extensions of A exist, and there\nis no way of defining a sensible, stable dynamics. On the other hand, at least\none positive, self-adjoint extension (namely, the Friedrichs extension) must exist\nin cases (i), (ii), and (iii). Our task is to find all of the positive, self-adjoint\nextensions of A in these cases.\nThere is a well known systematic method, due to von Neumann, for obtaining\nall of the self-adjoint extensions of an arbitrary symmetric operator on a Hilbert\nspace H. We will now review this method (see e.g., Ref. [26] for proofs and\nfurther details). Let A be a symmetric operator with domain Dom(A), and let\nA\u2217 denote the adjoint of A. Consider the subspaces K\u00b1 \u2282 H (called deficiency\nsubspaces) spanned by \u03a6\u00b1 \u2208 Dom(A\u2217 ) which satisfy respectively\nA\u2217 \u03a6\u00b1 = \u00b1i\u03a6\u00b1 .\n\n(138)\n\nLet n\u00b1 = dim(K\u00b1 ). (Either or both of n+ and n\u2212 may be infinite.) If n+ 6= n\u2212 ,\nthen no self-adjoint extension of A exists. If n+ = n\u2212 = 0, then there exists\na unique self-adjoint extension, obtained by taking the closure of A (see e.g.,\nRef. [26]). On the other hand, if n+ = n\u2212 6= 0, then all of the self-adjoint\nextensions of A can be constructed as follows: Let U : K+ \u2192 K\u2212 be a partial\nisometry, i.e., k\u03a6+ k = kU\u03a6+ k for all \u03a6+ \u2208 K+ . Given U, we define the associated\nself-adjoint extension, AE , of A by first taking the closure, \u0100, of A and then\nextending the domain of \u0100 by adding to it all elements of the form \u03a6U = \u03a6+ +\nU\u03a6+ , i.e., we define\nDom(AE ) = {\u03a60 + \u03a6+ + U\u03a6+ |\u03a60 \u2208 Dom(\u0100), \u03a6+ \u2208 K+ } .\n27\n\n(139)\n\n\fFor all \u03a6 \u2208 Dom(AE ), we define\nAE \u03a6 = \u0100\u03a60 + i\u03a6+ \u2212 iU\u03a6+ .\n\n(140)\n\nThen AE is self-adjoint, and all self-adjoint extensions of A can be obtained in this\nmanner. Thus, the self-adjoint extensions of A are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the partial isometries U : K+ \u2192 K\u2212 .\nFrom the definition of A\u2217 , it can be seen immediately that eq. (138) is equivalent to the statement that for all \u03a8 \u2208 Dom(A), we have\n((A \u00b1 i)\u03a8, \u03a6\u00b1 )H = 0 .\n\n(141)\n\nIn our case, A is an elliptic differential operator with domain C0\u221e (0, \u03c0/2) on the\nHilbert space H = L2 ([0, \u03c0/2], dx). It follows immediately that \u03a6\u00b1 satisfies the\nequation (A \u2213 i)\u03a6\u00b1 = 0 in the distributional sense. By elliptic regularity (see\nsubsection 2.1 above), it follows that \u03a6\u00b1 must be smooth on (0, \u03c0/2). Thus, in\nour case, the solutions to eq. (138) are precisely the smooth functions on (0, \u03c0/2)\nthat satisfy the ordinary differential equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd2\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 1/4 \u03c3 2 \u2212 1/4\n+\n\u03a6\u00b1 = \u00b1i\u03a6\u00b1 ,\n(142)\n\u2212 2+\ndx\ncos2 x\nsin2 x\nand are square integrable on (0, \u03c0/2). We turn now to an analysis of solutions to\nthis equation.\n\n3.2\n\nGeneral solutions to the eigenvalue equation\n\nIn this subsection, we analyse solutions to the ordinary differential equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd2\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 1/4 \u03c3 2 \u2212 1/4\n+\n\u2212 2+\n\u03a6 = \u03c92\u03a6 ,\n(143)\ndx\ncos2 x\nsin2 x\nwith \u03c3 given by eq. (127), with \u03bd an arbitrary non-negative real number, \u03bd > 0.\nThis encompasses cases (i), (ii), and (iii) of the previous subsection. As discussed\nin the previous subsection, the self-adjoint extensions of A can be determined by\nfinding all the square integrable solutions to this equation for \u03c9 2 = \u00b1i. More\ngenerally since the problem of finding the self-adjoint extensions of A is obviously\nequivalent to the problem of finding the self-adjoint extensions of aA for any\npositive real number a, the self-adjoint extensions of A can be determined by\nfinding the square integrable solutions to eq.

However, we also will be interested later in solutions\nto eq. (143) for \u03c9 2 < 0, i.e., \u03c9 imaginary. Therefore, at this stage we will allow\n\u03c9 to be an arbitrary complex number.\n28\n\n\fThe general solution to the equation (143) is given, in terms of hypergeometric\nfunctions, by\n\u03a6 = (sin x)\u03bd+1/2 * (cos x)\u2212\u03c3+1/2\nn\no\n\u0001\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\n\u00d7 B1 * (cos x)2\u03c3 * F \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n, \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n, 1 + \u03c3; cos2 x + B2 * F\u0303 (cos2 x) (144)\n\nwhere B1 , B2 \u2208 C, and here and hereafter we use the abbreviation\n\u03c9\n\u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n\u2261\n\n\u03bd +\u03c3+1+\u03c9\n.\n2\n\n(145)\n\nIf \u03c3 is not an integer (i.e., when the number of spacetime dimensions is even),\nthe second solution, F\u0303 (cos2 x), is given by\n\u0001\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\nF\u0303 (cos2 x) = F \u03b6\u03bd,\u2212\u03c3\n, \u03b6\u03bd,\u2212\u03c3\n, 1 \u2212 \u03c3; cos2 x .\n(146)\n\nIf \u03c3 + 1 is a natural number (i.e., when the number of spacetime dimensions is\nodd) then-with the exception of the case (which we shall not consider further\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\nhere) where \u03c9 is real and either 0 < \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n6 \u03c3 or 0 < \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n6 \u03c3-then we have [31]\n\u0001\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\nF\u0303 = F \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n, \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n, 1 + \u03c3; cos2 x * log(cos2 x)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u221e\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\nX\n\u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n\u03b6\n\u03bd,\u03c3\nk\nk\n+\n* {h(k) \u2212 h(0)} * (cos x)2k\n(1\n+\n\u03c3)\nk!\nk\nk=1\n\u2212\nwhere\n\n\u03c3\nX\nk=1\n\n(k \u2212 1)!

(147) should be\nignored.\nWe consider, now, the behaviour of these solutions near x = \u03c0/2, which\ncorresponds to the origin of spherical coordinates in AdS spacetime. For \u03c3 > 1,\nit follows immediately from the general form (144) of the solutions that the square\nintegrability of \u03a6 at x = \u03c0/2 requires B2 = 0. However, the situation is more\nsubtle for the cases \u03c3 = 1/2 and \u03c3 = 0.\nFor the case \u03c3 = 1/2-which occurs only for an S-wave (l = 0) for a scalar field\nin 4-dimensional (i.e., n = 2) spacetime-the leading behaviour near x = \u03c0/2 is\n29\n\n\f\u03a6(x) \u2248 B2 = const. Hence \u03a6 is square-integrable even when B2 6= 0, and it might\nappear that both solutions to eq. (143) are acceptable. However, this is actually\nan artifact of our having artificially removed the origin from the spacetime when\nwe used spherical coordinates to separate variables. (A similar phenomenon occurs when analysing the spherically symmetric eigenstates of the Hydrogen atom\nin ordinary quantum mechanics.) If we put the origin back and analyse \u03a6 on\nthe 3-dimensional space \u03a3, we find that the solution is not acceptable when\nB2 6= 0. To see this explicitly, define a Cartesian coordinate system, {X, Y, Z},\nin a neighbourhood of\u221athe origin x = \u03c0/2 on a three-dimensional timeslice, \u03a3,\nsuch that \u03c0/2 \u2212 x = X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 . Then, from eq. (42), the corresponding\nfield, \u03c6(X, Y, Z), defined on \u03a3 is expressed in this neighbourhood as\n\u03c6=\n\n\u0012\n\nsin x\ncos x\n\n\u0013n/2\n\n\u03a6S \u2248 \u221a\n\nX2\n\nB2\n.\n+ Y 2 + Z2\n\n(151)\n\nThis is square integrable in a neighbourhood of the origin X = Y = Z = 0\nwith the integration measure V \u22121 d\u03a3 = dXdY dZ. However, let \u00c3 denote the\n3-dimensional operator on L2 (\u03a3, V \u22121 d\u03a3) corresponding to A. the leading order\nbehaviour of \u00c3\u03c6 near the origin is given by\n\u2212V Di (V Di \u03c6) \u2248 \u2212(\u2202 2 /\u2202X 2 + \u2202 2 /\u2202Y 2 + \u2202 2 /\u2202Z 2 )\u03c6\n= 4\u03c0 * B2 * \u03b4(X)\u03b4(Y )\u03b4(Z) ,\n\n(152)\n\nwhere \u03b4(*) is the Dirac delta function. As a consequence of this additional \u03b4function source, the \"solution\", \u03c6, on \u03a3 when B2 6= 0, does not actually correspond to a distributional solution of \u00c3\u03c6 = \u03c9 2\u03c6 but rather to an equation\nthat contains an additional \u03b4-function source at the origin. In particular, when\n\u03c9 2 = \u00b12i, we do not obtain a solution to the analog of eq. (138) on \u03a3. Therefore,\nonly the solution with B2 = 0 is acceptable.\nSimilarly, for the case \u03c3 = 0-which occurs only for the S-wave (l = 0) for\na scalar field in the 3-dimensional (i.e., n = 1) case-\u03a6 behaves near x = \u03c0/2\nas \u03a6 \u2248 (cos x)1/2 {B2 log(cos2 x) + B1 + * * *}, which is square-integrable near x =\n\u03c0/2 even when B2 6= 0. However the original field \u03c6 defined on a 2-dimensional\nsurface \u03a3 behaves near the origin as\n\u03c6 \u2248 B2 log(X 2 + Y 2 ) + B1 + * * * ,\n\n(153)\n\nwith {X, Y } being locally defined Cartesian coordinates as in the \u03c3 = 1/2 case.\nAgain, if B2 6= 0, then on the 2-dimensional surface, \u03a3, \u03c6 does not correspond to a\nsolution to the equation of interest but rather to an equation with an additional\n\u03b4-function source. Thus, again the solutions with B2 6= 0 are not acceptable.\nThus, hereafter we discard the second solution F\u0303 (cos2 x) in all cases.\nHaving set B2 = 0, we now turn our attention to the boundary at x = 0,\ncorresponding to infinity in AdS spacetime. In order to more easily see the\n30\n\n\fasymptotic behaviour of \u03a6 near the boundary, it is convenient to transform the\nargument of the hypergeometric function F from cos2 x to sin2 x. Using the\nlinear transformation formulae for hypergeometric functions [32], we obtain the\nfollowing expressions:\nFor \u03bd 6= 0, \u03bd \u2208\n/ N, we have\n\u0001\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\n\u03a6 = B1 * (sin x)\u03bd+1/2 * (cos x)\u03c3+1/2 * F \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n, \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\n, 1 + \u03c3; cos2 x\n\u001a\n\u0001\n\u0393(1 + \u03c3)\u0393(\u03bd)\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\n= B1 * G\u03bd (x) *\n* F \u03b6\u2212\u03bd,\u03c3\n, \u03b6\u2212\u03bd,\u03c3\n, 1 \u2212 \u03bd; sin2 x\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\n\u0393(\u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3 )\u0393(\u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3 )\n\u001b\n\u0001\n\u0393(1 + \u03c3)\u0393(\u2212\u03bd)\n2\u03bd\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9\n2\n* (sin x) * F \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3 , \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3 , 1 + \u03bd; sin x\n, (154)\n+\n\u2212\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u0393(\u03b6\u2212\u03bd,\u03c3\n)\u0393(\u03b6\u2212\u03bd,\u03c3\n)\n\nwhere G\u03bd (x) was defined in eq.

(156) that \u03a6\nalso is square-integrable for all \u03c9 \u2208 C.\n\n31\n\n\f3.3\n\nSelf-adjoint extensions\n\nIn this subsection, we shall determine all of the positive self-adjoint extensions\nof the operator A, eq. (128) that satisfy the regularity condition at the origin,\nx = \u03c0/2, discussed in the previous subsection. (As discussed in the previous\nsubsection, this additional regularity condition need be imposed only in the case\nof the l = 0 modes of a scalar field in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions.) We have\nalready seen in Proposition 3.1 that if \u03bd 2 < 0 (case (iv)), A itself is unbounded\nbelow, so, clearly, no positive self-adjoint extensions exist. Thus, we need only\nconsider cases (i), (ii), and (iii). In these cases, A is positive, so there always\nexists at least one positive self-adjoint extension.\nAs explained in subsection 3.1 and at the beginning of subsection 3.2, we\nwill determine all of the possible self-adjoint extensions of A by finding all of\nthe square-integrable solutions to eq. (143) with \u03c9 2 = \u00b12i. We have just seen\nthat in case (i) (i.e., \u03bd 2 > 1), there are no such solutions, so the deficiency\nsubspaces are trivial. Hence, there is a unique self-adjoint extension of A, which\nis automatically positive. Thus, dynamics is well defined in this case, without the\nneed to specify any additional boundary conditions at infinity. One may interpret\nthis result as being a consequence of the fact that the effective potential term in A\nis sufficiently repulsive near infinity that the fields are completely reflected back\nwithout ever reaching the boundary. Hence, no boundary conditions at infinity\nneed be imposed.\nOn the other hand, in cases (ii) and (iii), we found in the previous subsection\nthat there is precisely one linearly independent square integrable solution to the\neigenvector equation (143) with \u03c9 2 = \u00b12i that satisfies the regularity condition\nat the origin. Consequently, each of the deficiency subspaces K\u00b1 (for the operator\n2A) is one-dimensional, and is spanned by the vector \u03a6\u00b1 of eqs. (154) (for case\n(ii)) and (156) (for case (iii)), with \u03c9 = 1 \u00b1 i, respectively, and with (B1 )\u00b1 chosen\nso that k\u03a6+ kL2 = k\u03a6\u2212 kL2 = 1.\nSince n+ = n\u2212 = 1 the only (partial) isometries from K+ to K\u2212 are given by\nU\u03b1 \u03a6+ = ei\u03b1 \u03a6\u2212\n\n(158)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]. Hence, in cases (ii) and (iii) there exists a one-parameter\nfamily of self-adjoint extensions, A\u03b1 , of A, (see eqs. (139) and (140)) parametrised\nby \u03b1 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]. Our remaining tasks are (1) to interpret the choice of extension,\nA\u03b1 , in terms of a choice of boundary condition at infinity and (2) to determine\nfor what values of \u03b1 the extension A\u03b1 is positive.\nIn order to investigate both of these issues, we need to know the asymptotic\nbehaviour of\n\u03a6\u03b1 \u2261 \u03a6+ + ei\u03b1 \u03a6\u2212\nnear x = 0.

Thus, in case\n(ii), the choice of self-adjoint extension of A is uniquely specified by the value\nof b\u03bd /a\u03bd , and a self-adjoint extension exists for any specified real value of this\nquantity (including \u00b1\u221e). Similarly, inspection of eqs. (165)-(166) shows that in\ncase (iii) (i.e., \u03bd = 0), the self-adjoint extensions of A are uniquely characterised\nby the ratio b0 /a0 , which may assume any real value (including \u00b1\u221e).\n33\n\n\fThe relationship between the choice of extension and the choice of boundary\nconditions can now be seen as follows. It is easily seen that for arbitrary initial\ndata in C0\u221e the general evolution law (4) yields \u03c6t \u2208 Dom(AE ). However, from\neq. (139), we see that Dom(AE ) consists of vectors in the domain of the closure\nof A-which have as rapid fall-off as is possible at the boundary-together with\nvectors of the form \u03a6\u03b1 = \u03a6+ + U\u03a6+ . Therefore, the boundary conditions that\nare satisfied by vectors of this latter form are the boundary conditions that will\nbe satisfied by all solutions that arise from arbitrary initial data in C0\u221e . Consequently, the choice of self-adjoint extension in cases (ii) and (iii) corresponds\nprecisely to the specification of the allowed asymptotic behaviour (as determined\nby the values of b\u03bd /a\u03bd and b0 /a0 , respectively) of solutions near infinity.\nThe interpretation of the allowed boundary conditions at infinity is most apparent in the conformally invariant case, \u03bd = 1/2, since in this case, the effective\npotential term in the operator A is regular at the boundary. For \u03bd = 1/2, it is\neasily seen from eq. (160) that we have\n\u2202\u03a6\u03b1 /\u2202x\n\u03a6\u03b1\n\n=\nx=0\n\nb\u03bd\n.\na\u03bd\n\n(168)\n\nTherefore, we see that the choice b\u03bd /a\u03bd = \u00b1\u221e (i.e., a\u03bd = 0) corresponds to the\nDirichlet boundary condition, \u03a6\u03b1 |x=0 = 0, and the choice b\u03bd /a\u03bd = 0 corresponds\nto the Neumann boundary condition, \u2202\u03a6\u03b1 /\u2202x|x=0 = 0. The other real choices\nof b\u03bd /a\u03bd correspond to general Robin boundary conditions, in which a linear\ncombination of \u03a6\u03b1 |x=0 and \u2202\u03a6\u03b1 /\u2202x|x=0 is required to vanish.\nFor \u03bd 6= 1/2, the effective potential term in A is divergent at x = 0 and the\nratio (\u2202\u03a6\u03b1 /\u2202x)/\u03a6\u03b1 itself is no longer well-defined at x = 0. Nevertheless, for 0 <\n\u03bd < 1, the dominant behaviour of G\u22121\n\u03bd \u03a6\u03b1 as x \u2192 0 is governed by a\u03bd , whereas the\n\u22121\ndominant behaviour of \u2202(G\u03bd \u03a6\u03b1 )/\u2202x is governed by b\u03bd . Therefore, for 0 < \u03bd < 1,\nit seems natural to define \"generalized Dirichlet conditions\" as corresponding\nto the case a\u03bd = 0 and \"generalized Neumann conditions\" as corresponding to\nthe case b\u03bd = 0. The other choices of self-adjoint extensions may be viewed\nas corresponding to generalized Robin conditions5 . The Friedrich's extension\ncorresponds to the choice a\u03bd = 0, i.e., to generalized Dirichlet conditions.\n\u22121\nFor \u03bd = 0, the dominant behaviour of both G\u22121\n0 \u03a6\u03b1 and \u2202(G0 \u03a6\u03b1 )/\u2202x as\nx \u2192 0 is governed by a0 . Thus, we may interpret the self-adjoint extension with\na0 = 0 as corresponding to the simultaneous imposition of generalized Dirichlet\nand Neumann conditions. This extension is precisely the Friedrich's extension.\n5\n\nGeneralized Robin boundary conditions play a role in the AdS-CFT correspondence when\none considers the double-trace perturbations of the quantum field theory on the boundary at\ninfinity. In this context, the ratio b\u03bd /a\u03bd appears in the action for the boundary field theory\nas a coupling constant to the double-trace interaction, and generalized Dirichlet and Neumann\nconditions correspond to fixed points of a renormalization group flow in the quantum field\ntheory on the boundary [12] (see also, e.g., [33, 34, 35, 15] and references therein).\n\n34\n\n\fWe turn now to the determination of which of the self-adjoint extensions A\u03b1\nare positive. Our main results are given by the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.2: Let A be the operator eq. (128) on the Hilbert space L2 ([0, \u03c0/2]),\ndefined on the domain C0\u221e (0, \u03c0/2). Then the self-adjoint extensions of A-\nsatisfying the regularity condition6 at the origin x = \u03c0/2 (see subsection 3.2)-\nand the positivity properties of these extensions are as follows:\ncase (i) If \u03bd 2 > 1, then there exists a unique self-adjoint extension, and it is\npositive.\ncase (ii) If 0 < \u03bd 2 < 1, then the self-adjoint extensions of A comprise a oneparameter family, A\u03b1 . These extensions are characterised by the ratio b\u03bd /a\u03bd ,\nwhich may assume any real value, but the extensions are positive if and only if\nb\u03bd /a\u03bd satisfies\n\u00012\n0\n\u0393(\u2212\u03bd) \u0393 \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\nb\u03bd\n>\u2212\n\u00012 ,\n0\na\u03bd\n\u0393(\u03bd) \u0393 \u03b6\u2212\u03bd,\u03c3\n\n(169)\n\n(This inequality includes the case b\u03bd /a\u03bd = \u221e, i.e., generalized Dirichlet conditions, a\u03bd = 0.)

Therefore, it remains only to prove the\npositivity claims in cases (ii) and (iii).\nIt is worth noting that by a relatively straightforward calculation A\u03b1 can be\nseen to be positive whenever b\u03bd /a\u03bd > 0 in case (ii) and when a0 = 0 in case (iii).\nNamely, to prove the positivity of A\u03b1 , it suffices to prove its positivity on the\nsmaller domain D\u03b1 defined by\nD\u03b1 = {\u03a60 + c\u03a6\u03b1 |\u03a60 \u2208 Dom(A), c \u2208 C} ,\n\n(173)\n\nsince it is clear that A\u03b1 is the closure of its restriction to D\u03b1 and positivity is\npreserved under taking closures. Note that all \u03a6 \u2208 D\u03b1 are smooth. Furthermore,\nsince A\u03b1 (\u03a60 + c\u03a6\u03b1 ) = A\u03a60 + 2ic\u03a6+ \u2212 2icei\u03b1 \u03a6\u2212 (where the factor of 2 difference\nfrom eq. (140) arises from our present use of \u00b12i rather than \u00b1i in the definition\nof the deficiency subspaces), it follows that for all \u03a6 \u2208 D\u03b1 , we have\n\u0013\nZ \u03c0/2 \u0012\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 1/4 \u03c3 2 \u2212 1/4\n\u22022\n\u2217\n\u03a6dx .\n(174)\n(\u03a6, A\u03a6)L2 =\n\u03a6 \u2212 2+\n+\n\u2202x\ncos2 x\nsin2 x\n0\nAs in Proposition 3.1, we may write\nA = D\u0303 \u2212 D\u0303 + + (\u2212\u03bd + \u03c3 + 1)2\n\n(175)\n\nwith\nD\u0303 \u00b1 \u2261 \u00b1\n\nd\ndG\u03bd\n\u2212 G\u03bd \u22121\n,\ndx\ndx\n\n(176)\n\nwhere G\u03bd (x) is given by eq. (130).\nIn case (ii)-i.e., when 0 < \u03bd < 1-it can be checked that D\u0303 + \u03a6 is squareintegrable for all \u03a6 \u2208 D\u03b1 . Consequently, integration by parts can be justified,\nand we obtain\nZ \u03c0/2\nZ \u03c0/2\nh\ni\u03c0/2\n2\n2\n\u2217 +\n|\u03a6| dx +\n+ (\u2212\u03bd + \u03c3 + 1)\n|D\u0303 + \u03a6|2 dx .(177)\n(\u03a6, A\u03a6)L2 = \u2212\u03a6 D\u0303 \u03a6\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nThe boundary term from the origin, x = \u03c0/2, vanishes. The boundary term from\nx = 0 is easily evaluated to yield\n(\u03a6, A\u03b1 \u03a6)L2 = 2\u03bda\u2217\u03bd b\u03bd + (\u2212\u03bd + \u03c3 + 1)2 k\u03a6k2L2 + kD\u0303 + \u03a6k2L2 ,\n\n(178)\n\nwhere a\u03bd and b\u03bd are given by eqs. (161) and (162). Note that \u03bda\u2217\u03bd b\u03bd is always real\n(since b\u03bd /a\u03bd is real for any self-adjoint extension), as must be the case, since A\u03b1\nis self-adjoint. By inspection, A\u03b1 will be positive whenever a\u2217\u03bd b\u03bd > 0, as is the\ncase whenever b\u03bd /a\u03bd > 0, including the case a\u03bd = 0.\nIn case (iii)-i.e., when \u03bd = 0-we observe from (164) that the asymptotic\nbehaviour of D\u0303 + \u03a6\u03b1 near x = 0 is\n\b\nD\u0303 + \u03a6\u03b1 = 2(cos x)\u03c3+3/2 a0 (sin x)\u22121/2 + c0 (sin x)3/2 log(sin2 x) + * * * . (179)\n36\n\n\fWe see, therefore, that D\u0303 + \u03a6\u03b1 is not square integrable except for the case when\na0 = 0. In this latter case, integration by parts is again justified, and we have\n(\u03a6, A\u03b1 \u03a6)L2 = (\u03c3 + 1)2 k\u03a6k2L2 + kD\u0303 + \u03a6k2L2 > 0 ,\n\n(180)\n\nso A\u03b1 is positive, as claimed.\nTo determine the precise range of positivity of A\u03b1 in cases (ii) and (iii), we\nnote that since A\u03b1 is strictly positive on the original domain of A (namely, the C0\u221e\nfunctions) and since the deficiency subspaces are only 1-dimensional, the negative\nspectral subspace of A\u03b1 can be at most 1-dimensional. If the strictly negative\nspectral subspace of A\u03b1 is 0-dimensional, then A\u03b1 is positive. On the other hand,\nif the strictly negative spectral subspace of A\u03b1 is 1-dimensional, then A\u03b1 must\nhave an eigenvector, \u03a8\u03b2 , of negative eigenvalue, \u2212\u03b2 2 , with \u03b2 > 0. By elliptic\nregularity, \u03a8\u03b2 must be a smooth solution to the differential equation (143),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bd 2 \u2212 1/4 \u03c3 2 \u2212 1/4\nd2\n+\n\u03a8\u03b2 = \u2212\u03b2 2 \u03a8\u03b2 .\n(181)\n\u2212 2+\ndx\ncos2 x\nsin2 x\nFurthermore, in order to lie in the closure of D\u03b1 , it is necessary that the asymptotic behaviour of \u03a8\u03b2 approach that of c\u03a6\u03b1 at x = 0 for some constant c \u2208 C in\nthe sense that as x \u2192 0 we must have \u03a8\u03b2 \u2212 c\u03a6\u03b1 = o([sin(x)]\u03bd+1/2 ).\nIn case (ii), it follows from our general solution, eq. (154), with \u03c9 = i\u03b2 that in\norder to have the required asymptotic behaviour of \u03a8\u03b2 as x \u2192 0, \u03b2 must satisfy\n\u00012\ni\u03b2\n\u0393 \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\nb\u03bd \u0393(\u03bd)\n.\n(182)\n\u0010\n\u00112 =\na\u03bd \u0393(\u2212\u03bd)\ni\u03b2\n\u0393 \u03b6\u2212\u03bd,\u03c3\n\nIt follows from the properties of the gamma-function that for fixed \u03c3 > 0 and fixed\n\u03bd in the range 0 < \u03bd < 1, the left side of this equation can be made arbitrarily\nlarge by letting \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e and takes its minimum at \u03b2 = 0. Taking into account\nthe fact that \u0393(\u03bd)/\u0393(\u2212\u03bd) is negative for 0 < \u03bd < 1, it follows that a solution to\neq. (181) with \u03b2 > 0 satisfying the required asymptotic behaviour exists if and\nonly if\n\u00012\n0\n\u0393(\u2212\u03bd) \u0393 \u03b6\u03bd,\u03c3\nb\u03bd\n<\u2212\n(183)\n\u00012 .\n0\na\u03bd\n\u0393(\u03bd) \u0393 \u03b6\u2212\u03bd,\u03c3\n\nThus, eigenvector of negative eigenvalue exists-and hence A\u03b1 fails to be positive-\nif and only if this equation holds. This proves the claims of the theorem for\ncase (ii).\nSimilarly, in case (iii), it follows from our general solution, eq. (156), that in\norder to have the required asymptotic behaviour as x \u2192 0, \u03b2 must satisfy\n\u0011 b\n\u0010\n\u0010 \u0011\n0\n\u2212i\u03b2\ni\u03b2\n=\n.\n(184)\n+ \u03c8 \u03b60,\u03c3\n2\u03b3 + \u03c8 \u03b60,\u03c3\na0\n37\n\n\fFrom the properties of the digamma function, \u03c8(x), we see that the left side\nachieves its minimum value when \u03b2 = 0 and becomes arbitrarily large when\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. Thus, we can solve this equation-and thereby obtain an eigenvector of\nA\u03b1 of negative eigenvalue-if and only\n\u0001\nb0\n0\n> 2\u03b3 + 2\u03c8 \u03b60,\u03c3\n.\na0\n\nThis proves the claims of the theorem for case (iii).\n\n(185)\n2\n\nWe conclude with several remarks.\nAs already noted, case (ii) was considered by Breitenlohner and Freedman [8,\n9] for scalar fields in 4-dimensional AdS spacetime. They showed that with the\nimposition of generalized Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, the initial\nvalue problem is well-posed in this case. Their choice of these boundary conditions\narose from the requirement that an energy functional for the scalar field be finite,\npositive, and conserved. However, they considered only two types of energy\nfunctionals: the usual energy functional of a minimally coupled scalar field, and\na conformal (\"improved\") energy functional. The requirement that the usual\nenergy functional be conserved allows only the generalized Dirichlet boundary\ncondition, whereas conservation of the conformal energy allows us to take either\nthe generalized Dirichlet or the generalized Neumann boundary condition. We\nwish to emphasise here that for any choice of a positive self-adjoint extension AE ,\nit is always possible to define a conserved, positive energy E for all \u03a6 \u2208 Dom(AE )\nby\nE(\u03a6) \u2261 (\u03a6\u0307, \u03a6\u0307)L2 + (\u03a6, AE \u03a6)L2 ,\n\n(186)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u0307 \u2261 \u2202\u03a6/\u2202t. The generalized Dirichlet and Neumann conditions considered\nin [8, 9], are merely two values of the one-parameter family of choices given by\neq. (169). For each boundary condition in this range, there is a corresponding\nconserved, positive energy (see also [11] for another definition of such a positive,\nconserved energy in the scalar field case).\nAs we have proven above, in cases (ii) and (iii), A also admits non-positive\nself-adjoint extensions; in case (iv), all self-adjoint extensions are unbounded\nbelow. If one chooses a non-positive self-adjoint extension, then one can still\ndefine dynamics in a manner analogous to eq. (4), but the dynamics will be\nunstable in the sense that generic solutions will grow unboundedly in time (see\n[36]). Indeed, in case (iv), since A is unbounded below, generic solutions will\nalways grow in time more rapidly than exp(at) for any positive a.\nWe note that our analysis shows that in AdS spacetime of any dimension, it\nis always possible to define a stable dynamics for electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. In spacetime dimension > 7, the dynamics is unique, and no\nchoice of boundary conditions at infinity need be made at all. However, in 4 and 6\ndimensions, one must make a choice of boundary conditions (in the range defined\n38\n\n\fby eq. (169)) for the scalar type of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations; in 4 dimensions, one must also choose boundary conditions in this range for\nthe vector type of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Similarly, in\n5-dimensional AdS spacetime one must make a choice of boundary conditions (in\nthe range defined by eq. (171)) for the scalar type of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Each of these choices of boundary conditions corresponds\nto a different theory of classical bulk dynamics.\nParticularly interesting in the context of the AdS-CFT correspondence is the\ncase in which the bulk geometry contains a black hole [37]. In the SchwarzschildAdS background, we also can obtain master equations for perturbations [30]\nanalogous to those derived in this paper. We then expect the same classification\n(i)-(iv) of the corresponding operator A to hold, because the classification (i)-(iv)\nis made by inspecting merely the asymptotic behaviour of perturbations near the\nboundary. However, since the effective potential term in the corresponding operator A will change significantly near the black hole event horizon [38], we would\nexpect that the precise relation between the positivity of self-adjoint extensions\nand the boundary conditions at infinity will change.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank Gary Gibbons, Sean Hartnoll, Stefan Hollands, and Hideo Kodama for many helpful discussions and useful suggestions.

Therefore the vector-type perturbation of the l = 1\nmode is a non-dynamical (i.e., time independent) perturbation, which can be\ninterpreted as describing a change in the angular momentum of the background.\nFor l = 1 (kS2 = n) of scalar-type perturbation, Di S is a conformal Killing\n(0)\nvector field, that is, Di Dj S + \u03b3ij S identically vanishes. Hence the term hT in\n(0)\n(73) is not present. Setting HT = 0 in the definitions (99) and (100) (and\nXa \u2261 \u2212H (0) a ), we can still use Z and Zab as metric perturbation variables, but\nin this case, Z and Zab are no longer gauge-invariant and equation (103) is not\nobtained. Under gauge-transformations generated by \u03be (0) a Sdy a + \u03be (0) Di Sdz i , we\nfind in particular, Z a a \u2212 Z \u2192 Z a a \u2212 Z + \u03b4\u0304(Z a a \u2212 Z) with\n\u001b\n\u001a\nn(n\n+\n2)\n1\n1\n(n\n\u2212\n2)(n\n\u2212\n4)\nc\na\nn/2\nb \u2207\nbc \u2212\n\u2212\n\u039e,\n(190)\n\u2207\n\u03b4\u0304(Z a \u2212 Z) \u2261 \u2212r\n4\nr2\n4\nl2\n\nwhere \u039e \u2261 \u22122r (n\u22124)/2 \u03be (0) . This implies that we can make eq. (103) hold by choosing \u039e suitably, or in other words we can impose eq. (103) as a gauge condition.\nIn this way, even for the l = 1 modes, we can recover the same expression of the\nlinearised Einstein equations for Z and Zab as in the l > 2 case.\nWe should note however that the gauge condition Z a a \u2212 Z = 0 does not completely fix gauges; it is possible to take further gauge transformations generated\nby \u039e that satisfies the homogeneous equation\n\u001a\n\u001b\n(n \u2212 2)(n \u2212 4) 1\nn(n + 2) 1\nab\nb\n\u2207 \u2207a \u2212\n\u2212\n\u039e = 0.\n(191)\n4\nr2\n4\nl2\n\nTherefore the remaining gauge degrees of freedom are characterised by two arbitrary functions of t, i.e., initial data (\u039e, \u2202\u039e/\u2202r) on a Cauchy surface r = r0 in\nthe globally hyperbolic spacetime (O 2 , \u2212gab ).\nNow we shall show that the solutions Z and Zab to the linearised Einstein\nequations are gauge modes; Z and Zab can be made to vanish by further gauge\ntransformations. First, with the gauge condition (103), repeating the same argument as in the l > 2 case (below eq. (104)), we can express Zab in terms of a\nscalar function \u03c6\u03be as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nb a\u2207\nb b \u2212 gab \u03c6\u03be ,\nZab = \u2207\n(192)\nl2\n40\n\n\fwhere \u03c6\u03be satisfies the linearised Einstein equation (see eqs. (120) and (121) with\nkS2 = n)\n!\nb ar\n\u2207\nn\n\u2212\n2\nb a\u2207\nba \u2212 n\nba +\nE(\u03c6\u03be ) \u2261 r 2 \u2207\n\u03c6\u03be = V (c2 sin t + c3 cos t) , (193)\n\u2207\nr\nl2\nwith c2 , c3 being arbitrary constants. Note that the term c\u2032\u20321 r, which may exist in\nthe right hand side (see eq. (123)), has been already set to zero by using the residual freedom of \u03c6\u03be defined by eq. (118). Next, we find the gauge transformation\n\u2032\nZab \u2192 Zab\n= Zab + \u03b4\u0304Zab with\n!\n\u001a\nb ar\nb br\n\u2207\n\u2207\n(n\n\u2212\n2)\nb b\u039e +\nb a\u039e\nb a\u2207\nb b\u039e \u2212\n\u2207\n\u2207\n\u03b4\u0304Zab \u2261 \u2212r n/2 \u2207\n2\nr\nr\n\nb cr\nb\nb\nb b\n\u2207\nb c \u039e + n(n \u2212 2) (\u2207a r)\u2207b r \u039e \u2212 n \u2207a \u2207b r \u039e\n\u2207\n4 #\nr2\n2 r\n\"r\n\u001b\nc\nb\nb\nn (\u2207 r)\u2207c r\n1\n\u039e ,\n(194)\n+(n \u2212 1)gab 2 \u2212\nr\n2\nr2\n+(n \u2212 1)gab\n\n\u2032\nwhere \u039e satisfies eq.

To achieve the gauge Zab\n= 0, we consider on an\ninitial Cauchy surface r = r0 the equations\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2032\nb\nb\nZab = \u03b4\u0304Zab (\u039e) + \u2207a \u2207b \u2212 2 gab \u03c6\u03be = 0 .\n(195)\nl\n\nThe trace part of eq. (195) is expressed as\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\nV \u2202 r n/2\n(n\u22122)/2 \u2202\n\u039e \u2212 n/2\n\u03a6\u03be\nVr\n\u2202r V r (n\u22122)/2\nr \u2202r\nV\n1\n= (n+2)/2 (c2 sin t + c3 cos t) ,\nnr\nV\n\n(196)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u03be \u2261 r \u2212n/2 \u03c6\u03be and we have used eqs. (191) and (193). Note that the\nconstants c2 and c3 in the right side of this equation are actually required to\nvanish due to the consistency with the (t, r)-component of eq. (195), and that\nin the case \u03a6\u03be obeys the homogeneous master equation E(r n/2 \u03a6\u03be ) = 0. The\n(t, t)-component of eq.

(196) and (197), we obtain the initial data\n(\u039e, \u2202\u039e/\u2202r) that satisfy eq. (195) on the initial surface r = r0 . Then we define \u039e\n\u2032\nto be the solution of eq. (191) with these initial data so that Zab\n= 0 is achieved\n2\nthroughout (O , \u2212gab ).\n\nReferences\n[1] G.W.
