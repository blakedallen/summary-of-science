We introduce a new set Ke (A, B) where A is a commutative C \u2217 -algebra, B is a C \u2217 -algebra. It contains KK(A, B).\nWhen A = S where S is the suspension, we show there is a nice\ninterpretation for Ke (A, B).\n\n1. Introduction\nSince Kasparov invented his celebrated bivariant KK-functor in 1981\n[Kas2], KK-theory was studied by several mathematicians-Joachim Cuntz,\nGoerge Skandalis, Nigel Higson, Claude Schochet, Jonathan Rosenberg\nduring 1981-90. The power and utility have been fully demonstrated\nby its applications to geomtry, topology and recently Elliott's Classification program since then.\nThe close connection between KK-theory and K-theory is one of main\nfeatures of KK-theory which is also the basic fact for the Universal\nCoefficient Theorem (shortly UCT). This paper is a try to pursue this\npoint of view further along the introduction of Brown and Pedersen\n's Ke and E\u221e [BrPed]. With the account of the Cuntz's description of\nKK-group, our goal is to find the appropriate counterpart for Ke (B)\nand E\u221e (B) where B is a C \u2217 -algebra. It turns out that a slight variation\nof Cuntz's picture also gives us the right candidate (See \u00a74 and \u00a75).\nThe plan of this papaer is as follows. After dealing with some preliminaries on completely positive mapping in \u00a72, we review definitions\nof E\u221e and Ke and summarize the basic facts which is necessary for\nour purpose in \u00a73.(For our goal, stability of these groups are essential.)\nIn \u00a74, we define [E(A, B)] and KKe (A, B) for A which is in a small\ncategory of commutative C \u2217 -algebras. In contrast with the definition\nKK-group, our definition shows a generality of a variable in KK-theory\nDate: May 15, 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Finally, in \u00a75, we establish the connection between [E(A, B)] ,KKe (A, B) and E\u221e (B), Ke (B)\nrespectively which generalizes the connection KK 1 (A, B) and K1 (B).\n2. Completely positive map between C \u2217 -algebras\nIn this section, we show some results about completely positive map\nof C \u2217 -algebras which will be useful later.\nFor the definition and basic facts of completely positive map of C \u2217 algebra, we recommend you Paulsen's Book [P] as a general reference.\nTheorem 2.1 (Stinespring's Dilation Theorem ). Let A be a (not necessarily unital) C \u2217 -algebra and B(H) be a space of the bounded linear operators on Hilbert space H. If \u03c6 : A \u2192 B(H) is completely\npositive map, then there exist a Hilbert space K, a nondegenerate *representation \u03c0 : A \u2192 B(K), and a bounded operator V : H \u2192 K such\nthat\n\u03c6(a) = V \u2217 \u03c0(a)V for all a \u2208 A\nproof. A general version of Stinespring Dilation theorem was suggested and proven by Kasparov [Kas1] in Hilbert C \u2217 -module setting.\nMost elaborate proof is found in P48-52 [Lan]\nLemma 2.2. Let A and B be C \u2217 -algebras. If \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is completely positive, then \u03c6 is completely bounded and k\u03c6kcb = supn k\u03c6n k =\nk\u03c6k. Consequently, \u03c6 is isometric(contractive), \u03c6 is completely isometric(contractive).\nproof.By the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, we can assume \u03c6 : A \u2192\nB(H) for some Hilbert space H. then by the above theorem, there exist\na Hilbert space K, a *-representation \u03c0 : A \u2192 B(K), and a bounded\noperator V : H \u2192 K such that \u03c6(a) = V \u2217 \u03c0(a)V . Since\nk\u03c6n ((ai,j ))k \u2264 kV \u2217 kk(ai,j )kkV k for each n,\nk\u03c6kcb \u2264 kV k2 , thus, \u03c6 is completely bounded. But if (ei ) is an approximate unit for A, using \u03c6(a\u2217 ei )\u03c6(ei a) \u2264 k\u03c6(e2i )k\u03c6(a\u2217 a), we can\n(n)\ndeduce k\u03c6k = supi k\u03c6(ei )k. Hence k\u03c6k = kV k2 . Finally, since ei =\nei \u2297 1 \u2208 A \u2297 Mn (C) \u223c\n= Mn (A) is an approximate unit for Mn (A) and\n(n)\nk\u03c6n (ei )k = k\u03c6(ei )k, using similar inequality for \u03c6n , we get k\u03c6k =\n(n)\nsupi k\u03c6(ei )k = supi k\u03c6n (ei )k \u2264 k\u03c6n k for each n. So we complete the\nproof.\nNow we are ready to prove the following proposition which will be\nbasic tool through this paper. We let \u00c3 be a unitization of A.\n\n\fCOMPLETELY POSITIVE MAPS AND EXTREMAL K-SET\n\n3\n\nProposition 2.3. Let A be non-unital, B be an unital C \u2217 -algebra and\n\u03c6 : A \u2192 B be completely positive and contractive. Then there is a\nunital map \u03c6\u0303 : \u00c3 \u2192 B which is also completely positive and extends \u03c6.\nMoreover, such a map is unique.\nproof. The idea of this proof is borrowed from Huaxin Lin. We\ndefine \u03c6\u0303(a + \u03bb) = \u03c6(a) + \u03bb1. Clearly, \u03c6\u0303 is extends \u03c6 and unital. To\nshow \u03c6\u0303 is completely positive, we must show \u03c6\u0303n ispositive. Note that\nany element b \u2208 Mn (\u00c3) can be written down as a + s where a \u2208 Mn (A)\nand s \u2208 Mn (C1).\nSuppose b is positive. By considering natural quotient map\nMn (\u00c3) \u2192\n\nMn (\u00c3)\nMn (A)\n\ns is also positive. For any \u01eb > 0, if we set s\u01eb = s + \u01eb1, then s\u01eb is\ninvertible. Since a + s\u01eb is positive, we have\n\u2212(s\u01eb )\u22121/2 a(s\u01eb )\u22121/2 \u2264 1Mn (\u00c3)\nLet (e\u03bb ) be an approximate identity for Mn (A). Thus\n\u2212e\u03bb (s\u01eb )\u22121/2 a(s\u01eb )\u22121/2 e\u03bb \u2264 (e\u03bb )2 .\nSince (s\u01eb )\u22121/2 is also scalar matrix, (s\u01eb )\u22121/2 a(s\u01eb )\u22121/2 \u2208 Mn (A) and\ne\u03bb (s\u01eb )\u22121/2 a(s\u01eb )\u22121/2 e\u03bb \u2192 (s\u01eb )\u22121/2 a(s\u01eb )\u22121/2 .\nSince \u03c6 is completely contractive by lemma 2.2\n\u03c6n (\u2212e\u03bb (s\u01eb )\u22121/2 a(s\u01eb )\u22121/2 e\u03bb ) \u2264 \u03c6n (e\u03bb )2 ) \u2264 1Mn (B)\nObserve that \u03c6n (sa) = s\u03c6n (a) and \u03c6n (as) = \u03c6n (a)s hold for any scalar\nmatrix s. From this observation, we obtain\n\u2212s\u22121/2\n\u03c6n (a)s\u22121/2\n\u2264 1Mn (B)\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\nConsequently,\n\u03c6n (a) + S\u01eb \u2265 0\nThus\n\u03c6\u0303(a + s) = \u03c6n (a) + s \u2265 \u2212\u01eb1Mn (B)\nNow let \u01eb \u2192 0. we get\n\u03c6\u0303(a + s) \u2265 0.\nSo we have shown \u03c6\u0303n is positive.Uniqueness part is obvious.\nLemma 2.4. Let A be a commutative C \u2217 -algebra and B a C \u2217 -algebra.\nIf \u03c6 : A 7\u2192 B is positive, then \u03c6 is completely positive.\n\n\f4\n\nHYUN HO LEE\n\nproof. (Unital case) If A is a unital commutative C \u2217 algebra, then\nwe can assume that A = C(X) where X is a compact Hausdorff space.\nLet \u01eb > 0 be given and P (x) be positive in Mn (C(X)). We must prove\n\u03c6n (P ) is positive. Using a partition of unity {ul (x)} subordinate to a\ncovering {Ol } such that kP (x) \u2212 P (xl )k < \u01eb for x \u2208 Ol and positive\nmatrices P (xl ) = Pl = (Pi,j ), we have\nX\nkP (x) \u2212\nul (x)Pl k < \u01eb\nl\n\nBut \u03c6n (ul Pl ) = (\u03c6(ul )pi,j ) which is postive in Mn (C(X)). Since Mn (B)+\nis closed set, \u03c6n (P ) is positive.\n(Non-unital case) If A is non-unital, we extend \u03c6 to \u00c3 the unitization\nof A. Define \u03c6\u0303 : \u00c3 \u2192 B\u0303 by \u03c6\u0303(a + \u03bb1) = \u03c6(a) + \u03bbk\u03c6k1. Note that if\na + \u03bb1 is positive, then \u03bb \u2265 0. From this, \u03c6\u0303 is also positive. Hence \u03c6\u0303 is\ncompletely positive as we have seen above. Consequently, Restriction\nof \u03c6\u0303 to A which is \u03c6 is also completely positive.\nLemma 2.5. Let B be a unital C \u2217 -algebra and A be a C \u2217 - algebra(not\nnecessarily unital) \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a completely positive contractive map.\nthen\n(1) {a \u2208 A| \u03c6(a)\u03c6(a\u2217) = \u03c6(aa\u2217 )} = {a \u2208 A| \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b) = \u03c6(ab) for all b \u2208\nA} is a subalgebra of A and \u03c6 is a homomorphism when it is\nrestricted to this set.\n(2) {a \u2208 A| \u03c6(a\u2217 )\u03c6(a) = \u03c6(a\u2217 a)} = {a \u2208 A| \u03c6(b)\u03c6(a) = \u03c6(ba) for all b \u2208\nA} is a subalgebra of A and \u03c6 is a homomorphism when it is\nrestricted to this set.\n(3) {a \u2208 A| \u03c6(a)\u03c6(a\u2217) = \u03c6(aa\u2217 )&\u03c6(a\u2217 a) = \u03c6(a\u2217 )\u03c6(a)}\n= {a \u2208 A| \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b) = \u03c6(ab)&\u03c6(ba) = \u03c6(b)\u03c6(a) for all b \u2208 A}\nis a subalgebra of A and \u03c6 is a *-homomorphism when it is\nrestricted to this set.\nproof. we prove (1). The proofs of (2) and (3) are similar.\nWe may assume that \u03c6 : A 7\u2192 B(H) where H is a Hilbert space. By\nthe theorem, there is a Hilbert space K containing H, V \u2208 B(K) with\nkV k \u2264 1 and \u03c0 : A 7\u2192 B(K) is a *-representation of A such that\n\u03c6(a) = V \u2217 \u03c0(a)V for all a.\nLet a belong to the set on the left. then since \u03c6(a)\u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(aa\u2217 )\nholds, we have V \u2217 \u03c0(a)(1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )\u03c0(a)V = 0. Note that kV k \u2264 1. This\nimplies that 1 \u2212 V V \u2217 is positive. Hence\nV \u2217 \u03c0(a)(1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )1/2 (1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )1/2 \u03c0(a\u2217 )V = 0\n\n\fCOMPLETELY POSITIVE MAPS AND EXTREMAL K-SET\n\n5\n\nConsequently, V \u2217 \u03c0(a)(1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )1/2 = 0.Then\nV \u2217 \u03c0(a)(1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )1/2 (1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )1/2 \u03c0(b)V\nV \u2217 \u03c0(a)(1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )\u03c0(b)V\n\u2234 V \u2217 \u03c0(a)V V \u2217 \u03c0(b)V\n\n= 0 for all b \u2208 A\n= 0 for all b \u2208 A\n= V \u2217 \u03c0(ab)V\n\nSo we have shown that a is the element of the set on the right.\nRemark 2.6. (i) We call the set in (1) left multiplicative domain for\n\u03c6, the set in (2) right multiplicative domain for \u03c6 and the set in (3)\nmultiplicative domain for \u03c6.\n(ii) There is a more general virsion of above lemma. See the theorem\n3.18 in [P].\nCorollary 2.7. Let \u03c6 : S \u2192 M(B \u2297 K) be completely positive contractive map. If \u03c6(f ) + 1 is a unitary, then \u03c6 is *-homomorphism.\nproof If \u03c6(f )+1 is a unitary, then \u03c6(f )\u03c6(f \u2217) = \u03c6(f f \u2217 )&\u03c6(f \u2217 )\u03c6(f ) =\n\u03c6(f \u2217f ) hold. Note that f is a generator of S. Hence {a \u2208 S| \u03c6(a)\u03c6(a\u2217) =\n\u03c6(aa\u2217 )&\u03c6(a\u2217 a) = \u03c6(a\u2217 )\u03c6(a)} is nonempty and is S itself. \u2234 \u03c6 is a *homomorphism by lemma2.5.\nProposition 2.8. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra(not necessarily unital), B be\na unital C \u2217 -algebra. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a positive map. Assume I+ , I\u2212\nare centrally orthogonal ideals in B. Let \u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 be the natural quotient\nmaps from B onto B/I+ , B/I\u2212 respectively. If\n\u03c6+ = \u03c0 + \u25e6 \u03c6 : A \u2192 B \u2192 B/I+\n\u03c6\u2212 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u25e6 \u03c6 : A \u2192 B \u2192 B/I\u2212\nare completely positive contractive, then \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is completely positive and contractive.\nproof. Consider the *-homomorphism \u03c0 + \u2295 \u03c0 \u2212 : B \u2192 B/I+ \u2295 B/I\u2212 .\nThen this map is injective since I + \u2229 I \u2212 = 0. Since the map \u03c6+ \u2295\n\u03c6\u2212 : A \u2192 B/I+ \u2295 B/I\u2212 is completely positive by the assumtion, \u03c6 is\ncompletely positive. In fact, B \u223c\n= {x\u2295y \u2208 B/I+ \u2295B/I\u2212 | Image of x =\nImage of y in B/I + + I \u2212 }. Hence k\u03c6(a)k = max{k\u03c6+ (a)k, k\u03c6\u2212 (a)k} \u2264\nkak. So we have shown \u03c6 is also contractive.\n3. Stable extremal class and Ke (\u2212)\nIn this section, we summarize the definitions of E\u221e (\u2212) and Ke (\u2212)\nand basic results from [BrPed]. Throughout this section A will denote a\nunital C \u2217 -algebra and E(A) the set of extreme points in the unit ball A1\nof A,that is, the patial isometries v such that (1 \u2212 v \u2217 v)A(1 \u2212 vv \u2217 ) = 0.\nThe centrally orthogonal projections p+ = 1 \u2212 v \u2217 v and p\u2212 = 1 \u2212 vv \u2217\n\n\f6\n\nHYUN HO LEE\n\nwill be referred to as the defect projections of v, and the two orthogonal\nclosed ideals I+ and I\u2212 generated by these projections will be known\nas the defect ideals of v.\nTheorem 3.1. Given \u01eb > 0 there is a \u03b4 > 0, such that for any pair\nv, w in E(A) with kv \u2212 wk \u2264 \u03b4, there are unitaries u1 and U2 in A with\nv = u1 wu2 and k1 \u2212 ui k \u2264 \u01eb for i = 1, 2.\nproof This is the theorem 2.1 in [BrPed].\nCorollary 3.2. Two elements v and w in E(A) are homotopic if and\nonly if w = u1 wu2 for some unitaries u1 , u2 in U0 (A), the connected\ncomponent of the unitary group U(A) containing 1.\nproof. See the corollary 2.3. in [BrPed].\nProposition 3.3. Let v and w be extremal partial isometries in A,\nand consider the defect projections p+ = 1 \u2212 v \u2217 v, p\u2212 = 1 \u2212 vv \u2217 , and\nq+ = 1 \u2212 w \u2217w, q\u2212 = 1 \u2212 ww \u2217; and the corresponding defect ideals I+ , I\u2212\nand J+ , J\u2212 . Then the following are equivalent.\n(1) p+ Aq\u2212 = p\u2212 Aq+ = {0},\n(2) I+ \u2229 J\u2212 = I\u2212 \u2229 J+ = {0},\n(3) \u0012\nvw \u2208 E(A)\n\u0013 and wv \u2208 E(A),\nv 0\n(4)\n\u2208 E(M2 (A))\n0 w\nproof. This is the proposition 2.5 in [BrPed].\nWhen the conditions in proposition3.3 are satisfied, we say that v\nand w are composable. We see the unitary elements are composable to\nall other elements in E(A), and also that they are the only elements\ncomposable their adjoints.\nCorollary 3.4. Suppose v and w are composable. If v1 is homotopic\nto v and w1 is homotopic to w, then v1 and w1 is also composable.\nproof It is easy to check that defect ideals of v1 and w1 are exactly\nthe defect ideals of v and w respectively. From this, the conclusion is\nstraightforward.\nProposition 3.5. When v and w are composable, two defect ideals for\nvw are precisely I+ + I\u2212 and I\u2212 + J\u2212 .\nproof Note that P+ = 1 \u2212 (vw)\u2217 vw = q+ + w \u2217 p+ w. Defect ideal\nwhich is generated by P+ = 1 \u2212 (vw)\u2217vw is contained in I+ + I\u2212 .\nConversely,from wP+ w \u2217 = p+ andP+ q+ = q+ , I+ + I\u2212 is also contained\nthe ideal generated by P+ . The other case is proved similarly.\n\n\fCOMPLETELY POSITIVE MAPS AND EXTREMAL K-SET\n\n7\n\nDefinition 3.6. Let A be a unital C \u2217 -algebra and for each n, consider\nthe set [E(Mn (A))] of homotopy classes of extreme partial isometires in\nthe algebra Mn (A). The embeddings\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv\n0\n\u03b9mn : v \u0592\u2192\n0 1m\u2212n\nof E(Mn (A)) into E(Mm (A)), for 1 \u2264 n < m, evidently respect homotopy, we define [E\u221e (A)] = lim[E(Mn (A))] in complete analogy with\n\u2212\u2192\nthe definition of K1 (A). We shall refer this set as the set of stable\nextremal classes for A and we shall denote by [v] its homotopy class in\n[E\u221e (A)].\nProposition 3.7. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra. Then\n[E\u221e (A)] \u223c\n= [E((A \u2297 K)\u223c )]\nproof. Note that \u03b9mn induce the isomorphism betweem [E\u221e (Mn (A))]\nand [E\u221e (Mm (A))] for 1 \u2264 n < m. In fact, any 'corner' embeddings\nid \u2297 eii are all homotopic.\nIf A = lim Ai is an s.e.p.p. inductive limit of C \u2217 -algebras(i.e. every\n\u2212\u2192\nconnecting morphism \u03b9i,j is stably extremal preserving maps), then\n[E\u221e (A)] = lim[E\u221e (Ai )] if each \u03b9i,j is injective.( See P218 in [BrPed]).\n\u2212\u2192\nThen by combining these two observations, we see that [E\u221e (A \u2297 K)] =\n[E\u221e (A)].\nSince [E(Mn (A \u2297 K))] \u223c\n=\n= [E(A \u2297 K)], [E\u221e (A \u2297 K)] \u223c\n= [E(A \u2297 K \u2297 Mn )] \u223c\n\u223c\n[E(A \u2297 K)] = [E((A \u2297 K) )]\nProposition 3.8. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra. If id \u2297 e11 : A 7\u2192 A \u2297 K\nis the corner embedding, then Ke (id \u2297 e11 ) is an isomorphism between\nKe (A) and Ke (A \u2297 K).\nproof. The argument is almost identical to proposition 3.7. See page\n219 4.12 (iv) of [BrPed].\n4. The set [E\u221e (\u2212, \u2212)] and KKe (\u2212, \u2212)\nBased upon Brown and Pedersen's work [BrPed], we define more\ngeneral functor [E\u221e (A, B)] where A is a C \u2217 -algebra generated by u \u2212 1\nwhere u is an unitary on a Hilbert space and B is \u03c3-unital C \u2217 -algebra.\nDefinition 4.1.

We let [E\u221e (A, B)] = E(A, B)/ \u223c denote the homotopy classes of generalized extremal cycles. The homotopy classes in\nE(A, B) represented by (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) \u2208 E(A, B) is denoted by [\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ].\nWe shall refer to [E\u221e (A, B)] as the set of stable extremal classes of\nA and B.\nProposition 4.3. KK(A, B) \u2286 [E\u221e (A, B)].\nproof. Since KK(A, B) = {[\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ] | \u03c6+ (a)\u2212\u03c6\u2212 (a) \u2208 B\u2297K for each a \u2208\nA}, where \u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 \u2208 Hom(A, M(B \u2297 K))(See Chapter4 in [JenThom]),\ntheir unital extensions \u03c6 \u0303+ , \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 are *-homomorphisms. In particular, \u03c6 \u0303\u2212\nsatisfies the conditions (a)and (b) in definition4.1. Since unitaries are\ncomposable to any extremal partial isometry, \u03c6 \u0303+ (u)\u2217 \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (u), \u03c6 \u0303+ (u)\u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (u)\u2217\nis of the form 1+B \u2297K because \u03c6 \u0303+ (u)\u2212 \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (u) \u2208 B \u2297K. i.e. (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) is\nin E(A, B). We can apply the same argument to a homotopy between\ntwo KK-cycles so that it is well-defined.\nWe can define a partial addition for manageable extremal classes.\nDefinition 4.4. We say two generalized extremal cycles (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) and\n(\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 ) are composable if \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (u) and \u03c8 \u0303\u2212 (u) are composable in E(M(B\u2297\nK)) for u.\nSuppose two generalized extremal cycles (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) and (\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 ) are\ncomposable.

This implies our definition of composability follows\nthe same spirit of the definition of composability in [BrPed]. Next result\nconsolidates our definition of composability is exactly analogous to and\nextended notion of the definition of composability of extremal partial\nisometries.\nProposition 4.5. The addition is associative whenever possible.\nproof If \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are elements in E(A, B) such that \u03b1 is composable with \u03b2 and \u03b1 + \u03b2 is composable with \u03b3, then \u03b2 is composable\nwith \u03b3 and \u03b1 is composable with \u03b2 + \u03b3. This follows by observing\nthat defect ideal for a sum of elements is the sum of the defect ideals\nfor the summands. Then using rotational homotopies finally we have\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2) + \u03b3 = \u03b1 + (\u03b2 + \u03b3)(See Lemma 1.3.12 in [JenThom]).\nWe summarize our observations in the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.6. For a non-unital C \u2217 -algebra A which is generated by\nu \u2212 1 where u is an unitary on a Hilbert space and \u03c3-unital C \u2217 -algebra\nB the set of extremal classes of A and B [E\u221e (A, B)] is a set with\na partially defined addition between composable elements.

Application: special case [E\u221e (S, \u2212)]\nWe begin this section by observing the following proposition. Let\nz(t) = e2\u03c0ti \u2208 C(T), f (t) = e2\u03c0ti \u2212 1 \u2208 S.\nProposition 5.1. Let \u03c6 : S \u2192 M(B \u2297 K) be a completely positive\ncontractive map and \u03c6\u0303 : C(T) \u2192 M(B \u2297 K) is the unital extension of\n\u03c6.

Note that f f \u0304 + f + f \u0304 = 0.\n \u0304 Similarly,\nis easy to check 1 \u2212 V V \u2217 = \u03c6(f f \u0304) \u2212 \u03c6(f )\u03c6(f).\n \u0304\n \u0304\n= \u03c6(f f ) \u2212 \u03c6(f )\u03c6(f ).\n\nProposition 5.2. Given a completely positive contractive map \u03c6 :\nC(T) \u2192 B a C \u2217 - algebra, if \u03c6(z) is an extremal partial isometry and\n\u03c6(eih ) = ei\u03c6(h) for any self-adjoint h in C(T), then \u03c6\u0303 is an extremal\npreserving map.\nproof. we assume \u03c6\u0303(z) is an extremal partial isometry, say v.\nConsider \u03c6+ = \u03c0 + \u25e6 \u03c6 : C(T) \u2192 M(B \u2297 K) \u2192 M(B \u2297 K)/I+ as we\n\n\f12\n\nHYUN HO LEE\n\nhave done in proposition 2.8. Note that the left multiplicative domain\nfor \u03c6 \u0303+ contains z. Hence the left multiplicative domain contains z n for\nn \u2265 0. C(T) i.e. \u03c6 \u0303+ is homomorphism. Since every extremal partial\nisometry in C(T) has the form eih z n where h is self-adjoint element in\nC(T), to finish the proof, it is enough to show that w = \u03c6\u0303(eih z n ) is\nextremal partial isometry. Since \u03c6 \u0303+ is homomorphism, we can deduce\n \u0303\n\u03c6 \u0303+ (eih z n ) = ei\u03c6+ (h) (\u03c6 \u0303+ (z))n\nIt is easily shown that 1 \u2212 w \u2217 w \u2208 I+ .\nSimilarly, using \u03c6\u2212 , we get 1 \u2212 ww \u2217 \u2208 I\u2212 also. Hence\n(1 \u2212 w \u2217 w)M(B \u2297 K)(1 \u2212 ww \u2217 ) = 0\nConsequently, w is an extremal partial isometry.\nCorollary 5.3. If \u03c6 is a *-homorphism from C(T) to B a C \u2217 -algebra,\nthen it is extremal preserving.\nproof. It is straightforward.\nBy applying the definition4.1 to S and z we have E(S, B) be the set\nof the pairs (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) s.t.\n(1) \u03c6+ : S \u2192 M(B \u2297 K) *-homomorphism, \u03c6\u2212 : S \u2192 M(B \u2297 K)\ncompletely positive contractive s.t.\n(a) \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z) is extremal partial isometry for the unitary element\nz \u2208 S\u0303 = C(T)\n(b) \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z n ) = (\u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z))n \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 ((z \u2217 )n ) = (\u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z \u2217 ))n for the unitary\nelement u \u2208 S\u0303\n \u0303\n(2) \u03c6+ (z) \u2212 \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z) \u2208 B \u2297 K thus (\u03c6 \u0303+ (z))\u2217 \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z) \u2208 1 + B \u2297 K\nWe call such a pair (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) as an extremal cycle and denote the set\nof extremal cycles by E(S, B). Two extremal cycles (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ), (\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 )\nare homotopic when there is an extremal cycle from S to M([0, 1]B\u2297K)\ni.e. (\u03bbt+ , \u03bbt\u2212 ) \u2208 E(S, B), t \u2208 [0, 1] s.t.\n(1) the maps t \u2192 \u03bbt+ (f ) + 1 and t \u2192 \u03bbt\u2212 (f ) + 1 from [0, 1] to\nM(B \u2297 K) are strictly continuous.\n(2) For each t, (\u03bbt+ (f ) + 1)\u2217, \u03bbt\u2212 (f ) + 1 are composable and the map\nt \u2192 (\u03bbt+ (f ) + 1)\u2217 \u03bbt\u2212 (f ) + 1 from [0, 1] to 1 + B \u2297 K is norm\ncontinuous.\n(3) (\u03bb0+ , \u03bb0\u2212 ) = (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ), (\u03bb1+ , \u03bb1\u2212 ) = (\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 )\nWe write (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) \u223c (\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 ) in this case.\nRemark 5.4. In fact, since E(S) = E(S\u0303) = E(C(T)) = U(C(T)), the\nset of homotopy classes of E(S) is K1 (C(T)) = {[z(t)n ]} \u223c\n= Z. By\n\n\fCOMPLETELY POSITIVE MAPS AND EXTREMAL K-SET\n\n13\n\nproposition5.1 and corollary3.4, for (\u03c6+ , \u03c6+ ) to be extremal cycle, it is\nenough to consider f (t) \u2208 S (or z(t) \u2208 C(T)).\ndef\n\nDefinition 5.5. We let E\u221e (S, B) = E(S, B)/ \u223c denote the homotopy\nclasses of extremal cycles.\nOur starting point is the following proposition which tells us an intimate relationship between KK-theory and K-theory.\nLemma 5.6. Let w be a extremal partial isometry in M(B \u2297K). Then\nthere is a strictly continuous path wt , t \u2208 [0, 1], of extremal partial\nisometries such that w0 = 1, w1 = w.Furthermore, if w is of the form\n1 + B, then we can take w(t) of the form 1 + B \u2297 K.\nproof Since B \u2297 K is stable C \u2217 -algebra, there is a path vt , t \u2208]0, 1],\nof isometries in M(B \u2297 K) such that\n(1) the map t 7\u2192 vt is strictly continuous,\n(2) v1 = 1, and\n(3) limt\u21920 vt vt\u2217 = 0 in the strict topology\nSee [JenThom]. Set w(t) = vt wvt\u2217 + 1 \u2212 vt vt\u2217 , t \u2208]0, 1], and w0 = 1. We\nleave the reader to check wt has the desired properties.\nProposition 5.7. KK(S, B) \u223c\n= K1 (B) where S is suspension and B\n\u2217\nis trivially graded stable C -algebra.\nproof. We give a proof based on Cuntz picture of KK. Recall that\nKK(S, B) = {[\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ]|\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 : S \u2192 M(B \u2297 K) s.t. \u03c6+ \u2212 \u03c6\u2212 \u2208 B \u2297 K}\nFor this definition, you can refer p155-156 [Bl].\n\u2217\nObserve that any *-homomorphism \u03c6 from S into a unital C -algebra\ndefines a unitary \u03c6(f )+1 where f (t) = e2\u03c0it \u22121. Conversely, any unitary\nu defines a homomorphism by sending f to u\u22121. Two homomorphisms\nare homotopic if and only if the corresponding unitaries are homotopic.\nFrom this,if we let U+ , U\u2212 be the unitaries which come from \u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212\nrespectively then we get\nKK(S, B) \u223c\n= {[U+ , U\u2212 ]|U+ \u2212 U\u2212 \u2208 B \u2297 K U+ , U\u2212 \u2208 M(B \u2297 K)}\nNote that U+\u2217 U\u2212 is a unitary in (B \u2297 K)\u223c which is a unitization of\nB \u2297 K. So we can define a map \u2206 : KK(S, B) \u2192 K1 (B \u2297 K) by\n\u2206([U+ , U\u2212 ]) = [U+\u2217 U\u2212 ]1 . Since [U+ , U\u2212 ] = [V+ , V\u2212 ] implies that there\nexist maps t \u2192 W\u00b1t from [0, 1] to M(B \u2297 K) s.t. t \u2192 W+t \u2212 W\u2212t is\ncontinuous in norm B \u2297 K and (W+0 , W\u22120 ) = (U+ , U\u2212 ), (W+1 , W\u22121 ) =\n(V+ , V\u2212 ) , U+\u2217 U\u2212 is homotopic to V+\u2217 V\u2212 . Hence \u2206 is well defined. Also,\nyou can easily check [U+ , U\u2212 ] are degenerate if and only if U+ = U\u2212 .\nTo prove \u2206 is surjective, let U be the unitary in (B \u2297 K)\u223c . As we\n\n\f14\n\nHYUN HO LEE\n\noberved, there is a unique map \u03c6 : S 7\u2192 B \u2297 K s.t. \u03c6(z \u2212 1) =\nU \u2212 1. Then \u2206([0, \u03c6]) = U. We remark that we could associate to\n[0, \u03c6] Kasparov module [(\u0124B , \u03c6, 0)] using compact perturbation.\nNow let \u2206([U+ , U\u2212 ]) = \u2206([V+ , V\u2212 ]). Then there is a homotopy between\nU+\u2217 U\u2212 and V+\u2217 V\u2212 . let P (t) be the corresponding homotopy in 1 + (B \u2297\nK). Since there are strictly continuous maps V (t) : [0, 1] 7\u2192 M(B \u2297 K)\n, W (t) : [0, 1] 7\u2192 M(B \u2297 K) which connects U+ and V+ , U\u2212 and V\u2212\nrespectively by lemma 5.6, then (W (t)P (t)\u2217 , V (t)P (t) is a homotopy\nbetween (U+ , U\u2212 ) and (V+ , V\u2212 ). Hence we have proven \u2206 is injective.\nThe following lemmas are the key facts in this paper which employ\nnice properties of S and M(B \u2297 K).\nLemma 5.8. Given an extremal partial isometry v in a unital C \u2217 algebra B, there is a completely positive contractive map from S to B\nwhich sends f to v \u2212 1.In fact, there is the unique completely positive\nunital map \u03c6\u0303 from C(T) to B which sends z to v such that \u03c6\u0303(z n ) = v n\nand \u03c6\u0303(z \u2212n ) = (v \u2217 )n for n \u2265 0.\nproof. By lemma2.4, it is enough to show that there is a contractive\npositive map \u03c6 : S \u2192 B which send f to v \u2212 1. Let I+ , I\u2212 be defect\nideals of v. Define \u03c6\u0303 by \u03c6\u0303(p(ei\u03b8 ) + q(ei\u03b8 )) = p(v) + q(v)\u2217 where p, q are\npolynomials in C(T). In B/I+ , \u03c0 + (v) = v is an isometry. Therefore\nP\nin\u03b8\nis a positive function in C(T),\n\u03c6\u0303+ (ei\u03b8 ) = v. If \u03c4 (ei\u03b8 ) = N\nn=\u2212N an e\nPN\nthen there is a function f (z) = n=0 bn z n such that \u03c4 (ei\u03b8 ) = |f (ei\u03b8 )|2 .\nIt is easy to check \u03c6\u0303+ (f (ei\u03b8 )f (ei\u03b8 )) = f (v)f (v)\u2217 since v is isometry.\nHence, \u03c6\u0303+ is positive. By Russo-Dye theorem, k\u03c6 \u0303+ k = k\u03c6 \u0303+ (1)k = 1.\nBy this, \u03c6\u0303+ is also contractive. Similarly, we can show that \u03c6\u0303\u2212 is positive\nand contractive. Then, by the proposition2.8, \u03c6\u0303 is completely positive\nand contractive. Let \u03c6 be the restriction of \u03c6\u0303 to S. Then \u03c6 is also\ncompletely positive and\n \u0303\nk\u03c6(a)k\nk\u03c6(a)k\nk\u03c6\u0303(a)k\nsup\n= sup\n\u2264 sup\n\u22641\nkak\nkak\na\u2208S\na\u2208S\na\u2208C(T) kak\nimplies it is also contractive. From the definition of \u03c6\u0303, it is unique.\nLemma 5.9. The unitary group of M(B \u2297 K) is path-connected in\nnorm topology.\nproof. This is well-known Kuiper-Mingo's theorem. The proof of\nthis theorem can be found in [CH] or [Mi].\nNow we are ready to prove the main result of this paper. By our\nobservation, if we let u, v be an unitary element in M(B \u2297 K), an\nextremal partial isometry in M(B \u2297 K) from \u03c6 \u0303+ , \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 respectively and\n\n\fCOMPLETELY POSITIVE MAPS AND EXTREMAL K-SET\n\n15\n\ndenote by [u, v] its homotopy class, then we have natural map which\nsend [\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ] to [u, v]. In fact, we have\nE\u221e (S, B) \u223c\n= {[u, v] | u\u2217 v \u2208 E(M(B \u2297 K)) & u\u2217v \u2208 1 + B \u2297 K}\nClearly, this map is well-defined and it is surjective by the lemma5.8.\nSuppose \u03c6 \u0303i+ (z) = ui , \u03c6 \u0303i\u2212 (z) = vi for i = 0, 1 If [u0 , v0 ] = [u1 , v1 ],\nthere is a homotopy between (u0 , v0 ) and (u1 , v1 ). i.e. there are strictly\ncontinous maps \u03bb\u00b1 : [0, 1] 7\u2192 U(M(B \u2297 K)) s.t. \u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 is normcontinuous map & (\u03bb+ (i), \u03bb\u2212 (i)) = (ui , vi ) for i = 0, 1. By lemma\n5.8, there are corresponding maps \u03bbt\u00b1 : S 7\u2192 M(B \u2297 K) for each\nt \u2208 [0, 1]. We must show the strict continuity of each map. Using the\nPn=k\nan z n | an \u2208 C} is dense in C(T), it's enough to show\nfact { n=\u2212k\nP\nn=k\nan z n )T where T \u2208 M(B \u2297 K) is norm continuous with\nt \u2192 \u03bbt\u00b1 ( n=\u2212k\nPn=k\nPn=k\nan z n )T k \u2264\nan z n )T \u2212 \u03bbs\u00b1 ( n=\u2212k\nrespect to t.

Now let \u03b4 be such that if |t \u2212 s| < \u03b4\n\u01eb\nfor each n = \u2212k, \u2212k +\nthen k(\u03bb\u00b1 (t))n \u2212 (\u03bb\u00b1 (t))n T k < 2k+1sup\nn |an |\nPn=k\nn\n1, . . . , k \u2212 1, k. Therefore if |t \u2212 s| < \u03b4 we have k n=\u2212k\nan (\u03bbt\u00b1 (z) \u2212\nP\nn=k\n\u03bbs\u00b1 (z)n )T k < n=\u2212k\n|an |k(\u03bb\u00b1 (t))n \u2212 (\u03bb\u00b1 (t))n T k < \u01eb.\nP\nn=k\nan z n ) is shown to be norm-continuous with\nSimilarly, t \u2192 T \u03bbt\u00b1 ( n=\u2212k\nrespect to t and t \u2192 \u03bbt+ (f ) \u2212 \u03bbt\u2212 (f ) is shown to be norm-continuous\nPn=k\nan z n .\nwith respect to t for each f = n=\u2212k\nFinally we should check that (\u03bbi+ , \u03bbi\u2212 ) = (\u03c6i+ , \u03c6i\u2212 ) for i = 0, 1. But\nboth maps \u03bb \u0303i\u00b1 and \u03c6 \u0303i\u00b1 send z to same extremal partial isometries ui\nand vi . In addition, both maps send z n to uni , vin and send (z \u2217 )n to\n(u\u2217i )n ,(vi\u2217 )n . From the uniqueness of lemma 5.8, the conclusion follows.\nSince K1 (B) is embedded in [E\u221e (B)], we can think of a set containing KK(S, B) which extends the map \u2206 : KK(S, B) \u2192 K1 (B). As\nindicated above (proposition4.3), we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.10. There is a bijection \u2206e : [E\u221e (S, B)] \u2192 [E\u221e (B)] such\nthat the following diagram is commutative.\n\u2206\n\n[E\u221e (S, B)] \u2212\u2212\u2212e\u2192 [E\u221e (B)]\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u2206\n\nKK(S, B) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 K1 (B)\n\nproof. We define the map \u2206e by \u2206e ([u, v]) = u\u2217 v as we have defined\n\u2206.\n\n\f16\n\nHYUN HO LEE\n\nIt's not hard to check well-definess of the map.(It is almost same as the\nwell-definess of the map \u2206.)\n^\nSurjectivity: Let v be the extremal partial isometry in B\n\u2297 K. Since\n^\nB\u2297K\n^\nthe quotient map from B \u2297 K onto B\u2297K = C is extremal preserving\nmap, the scalar part of v is also the extremal partial isometry in C. If v\nis written as \u03bb+T where T \u2208 B\u2297K and \u03bb \u2208 C, (1\u2212|\u03bb|2 )C(1\u2212|\u03bb|2 ) = 0.\nHence 1 \u2212 |\u03bb|2 = 0. In other words, \u03bb \u2208 T. Hence we may assume v is\nof the form 1 + B \u2297 K if necessary to multiply \u03bb\u0304. Then there is a map\n\u03c6 : S \u2192 M(B \u2297 K) such that \u03c6(f ) + 1 = v by the lemma 5.8. Then\n\u2206e ([0, \u03c6]) = [v].\nInjectivity: Let \u2206e ([u0 , v0 ]) = \u2206e ([u1 , v1 ]). We may assume (u0 )\u2217 v0 =\n(u1)\u2217 v1 . Let \u03bb+ : [0, 1] 7\u2192 U(M(B \u2297 K)) be a norm-continuous map\nbetween u0 and u1 by lemma 5.9. Set \u03bb\u2212 (t) = \u03bb+ (t)((u0 )\u2217 v0 ).\nThen\n\u03bb\u2212 (0) = \u03bb+ (0)(u0 )\u2217 v0 = v0\n\u03bb\u2212 (1) = \u03bb+ (1)(u1 )\u2217 v1 = v1\nAlso, \u03bb+ (t) \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 (t) = \u03bb+ (t)(1 \u2212 (u0 )\u2217 v0 ) \u2208 B \u2297 K for all t \u2208 [0, 1].\nTherefore (\u03bb+ , \u03bb\u2212 ) is a homotopy between (u0 , v0 ) and (u1 , v1 ) as we\nwanted.\nTheorem 5.11. There is a bijective map \u2206k from KKe (S, B) onto\nKe (B) such that the following diagram is commutative.\n\u2206\n\nKKe (S, B) \u2212\u2212\u2212k\u2192 Ke (B)\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\u03ba\n\uf8e6\n\u03bae \uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u2206\n\n[E\u221e (S, B)] \u2212\u2212\u2212e\u2192 [E\u221e (B)]\n\nproof. For each extremal cycle (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ), we shall denote the element\nof KK(S, B) by [(\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 )] ( or equivalently, [u, v] ) To avoid confusion\nwe shall denote by [(\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 )]\u221e its homotopy class in E\u221e (S, B). Sim^\nilarly, for each w in E(B\n\u2297 K), we shall denote by [w] its equivalent\n^\n^\nclass in Ke (B \u2297 K) and by [w]\u221e its homotopy class in E\u221e (B\n\u2297 K).\n\u2217\n \u0303\n \u0303\nNow define \u2206k ([\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ]) by [u v] where u = \u03c6+ (z) and v = \u03c6\u2212 (z).\nLet [(\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 )] = [(\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 )]. Then there is (\u03c4+ , \u03c4\u2212 ) such that \u03c4 \u0303\u2212 (z) = v\nhas smaller defects ideals than \u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z) = v0 and \u03c8 \u0303\u2212 (z) = v1 s.t.\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0013 \u0012\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u03c8\u2212 0\n\u03c6\u2212 0\n\u03c8+ 0\n\u03c6+ 0\n, \u0398B \u25e6\n\u223c \u0398B \u25e6\n, \u0398B \u25e6\n\u0398B \u25e6\n0 \u03c4\u2212\n0 \u03c4+\n0 \u03c4\u2212\n0 \u03c4+\n\n\fCOMPLETELY POSITIVE MAPS AND EXTREMAL K-SET\n\n17\n\nSince \u0398B is isomorphism, this implies\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0013\u2217 \u0014\n\u0015 \u0012\u0014\n\u0015\u0013\u2217 \u0014\n\u0012\u0014\n\u03c8 \u0303\u2212 (z)\n0\n\u03c8 \u0303+ (z)\n0\n\u03c6 \u0303\u2212 (z)\n0\n\u03c6 \u0303+ (z)\n0\n\u223c\n0\n\u03c4 \u0303\u2212 (z)\n0\n\u03c4 \u0303+ (z)\n0\n\u03c4 \u0303\u2212 (z)\n0\n\u03c4 \u0303+ (z)\nTherefore [u\u22170 v0 ]\u221e + [u\u2217 v]\u221e = [u\u22171 v1 ]\u221e + [u\u2217 v]\u221e i.e. [u\u22170 v0 ]\u221e \u2248 [u\u22171 v1 ]\u221e\nSo far we have shown \u2206k is well-defined.\nFrom the definition of \u2206k , the commutativity of diagram follows easily\nso that the map is surjective.\nIt remains only to show the map is injective. For this let [u\u22170 v0 ] = [u\u22171 v1 ]\n^\nin Ke (B\n\u2297 K). Note that defect ideals of u\u22170 v0 and u\u22171 v1 are same to\n^\ndefect ideas of v0 and v1 . Therefore there is v in E(B\n\u2297 K) such that\n\u2217\nv has smaller defect ideals that v0 and v1 s.t. u0 v0 v \u223c u\u22171 v1 v. In other\nwords, [(u0 , v0 )]\u221e + [(1, v)]\u221e = [(u1 , v1 )]\u221e + [(1, v))]\u221e . This implies the\nmap is injective by the routine argument.\nReferences\n[BrPed] Lawrence G.
