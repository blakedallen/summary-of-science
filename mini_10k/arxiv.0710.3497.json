The exact\nequations for the buoyant flows are therefore very difficult\nto tackle directly. In 1903, Joseph Boussinesq introduced\na set of approximations and derived simplified equations\nfor buoyant motion [1]. His three key approximations\nare :\n1) the fluid's properties are constant,\n2) the flow is incompressible (except for a linear temperature dependence of density yielding the buoyant term),\n3) the heat equation is not coupled to the flow mechanical\nenergy (\"conservation of calories\")\nToday, Boussinesq approximations are widely used to\ndescribe a large number of flows and to perform numerical simulations. A recent review presents an overview\nof works dedicated to the applicability of Boussinesq\napproximation and to its mathematical justification[2].\nOberbeck's name is occasionally associated with Boussinesq's to refer to the set of approximations presented\n\nabove. As a side remark, it is worth noting that his\nconvection model preserves compressibility and neglects\nall the time derivatives with respect to space derivatives\n[3].The resulting differential equations and physics significantly differs from the ones obtained by Boussinesq's.\nTo be able to predict if Boussinesq's approximations\nare applicable, specific quantitative criteria are necessary\nfor each type of flow. The present work derives such criteria for Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard (RB) turbulent convection[4, 5],\nassuming constant properties of the fluid (first approximation satisfied). A vast literature is dedicated to this\nfirst approximation, in particular for high Prandtl numbers in connection with mantle convection (for example see [6, 7, 8, 9] and references within). For the\nintermediate Prandtl numbers, recent progresses have\nbeen reported in the turbulent regime (for example see\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and references within).\nBoussinesq second approximation (\"incompressibility\") and third one (\"conservation of calories\") consist\nin neglecting nearly half of the terms present in the exact equations of motion. When the magnitude of all the\n\n\f2\nterms can be estimated using typical scales of the flow,\nthe applicability of the approximation can be predicted.\nIn laminar RB convection, temperature and velocity gradients smoothly spread across the cell, which eases the\nchoice of typical scales in the flow. A set of criteria for\nthe applicability of Boussinesq approximation have been\nproposed in this low Rayleigh number (Ra) limit (for example see [15, 16] and ref. within). In turbulent RB\nconvection (high Ra), choosing the correct typical scales\nis less straightforward due to the flow complexity. In\nthe present work, we attempt to do so using various experimental results and simple modelling. We derive a\nnew set of 4 criteria for the validity of Boussinesq approximation in a turbulent RB cell. In our derivation,\nwe prioritise high Rayleigh numbers Ra and intermediate Prandtl numbers (P r) fluids (say P r \u223c 0.5 \u2212 30), as\nthis range of parameters is relevant to many geophysical\nflows of air and water, industrial flows and high Ra experiments with air, water, SF6 and helium. Using these\ncriteria, we investigate the validity of Boussinesq approximations in experimental set-ups with water, air and helium. In particular, we show that one criteria is much\nmore stringent than the others in most experiments, at\nleast below Ra \u223c 1016 typically. At higher Ra, a second\ncriteria could become relevant. We also examine if deviations from Boussinesq approximation can explain the\napparent incompatibility of heat transfer measurements\namong very high Ra experiments. We find that it is not\nthe case.\nThe next section recalls the exact equations of motion and singles out the different terms which have to\nbe neglected to obtain Boussinesq's equations. In the\nthird section, the magnitudes of these terms are compared with the retained terms by modelling turbulent\nconvection. This yields a set of 4 criteria for the validity\nof Boussinesq approximation, which are summarised and\ndiscussed in the fourth section.

Th is the linearised adiabatic\ngradient term defined by Eq.(2a). The pressure P0 + Ph\nand density \u03c10 + \u03c1h fields satisfy the hydrostatic balance Eq.(2b) and thermodynamic equilibrium Eq.(2c) of\na static stratified fluid with a temperature distribution\nT0 + Th (z). At cell's mid-height (z = 0), we set \u03c1h (0) = 0\n\n=\n\n\u03b12 gT0\n\u2212 \u03c7g (\u03c10 + \u03c1h )\ncp\n(2c)\n\nwhere \u03b1, g, cp and \u03c7 are the isobaric thermal expansion\ncoefficient, the gravity acceleration, the isobaric heat capacity per unit mass and the isothermal compressibility\ncoefficient.\nThe residual terms \u03b8, p and \u03b4\u03c1 account for fluctuations\nand for the inhomogeneities which are not captured by\nthe stratification terms Th , Ph and \u03c1h . For example,\nfluctuations are generated by turbulence and inhomogeneities result from the temperature forcing and confinement by the cell side walls. The potential temperature\ndifference \u2206 and the adiabatic-gradient temperature difference \u2206h across a convection cell of height h are defined\nas :\n\u2206 = \u03b8(\u2212h/2) \u2212 \u03b8(h/2)\n\u2206h = Th (h/2) \u2212 Th (\u2212h/2) =\n\n\u03b1gT0 h\ncp\n\n(the notation \u22072 will be used for the Laplacian operator\nto avoid confusion with the temperature difference \u2206).\nThe mass, momentum and energy conservation equations\nare :\n\u2207v = \u2212\n\n1 D\u03c1\n\u03c1 Dt\n\nDv\n= \u2212\u2207P + \u03c1g + F\nDt\nDT\nDP\n\u03c1cp\n= k\u22072 T + \u03c1\u03a6 + \u03b1T\nDt\nDt\n\u03c1\n\nII.\n\n(2b)\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n(4c)\n\nwhere D/Dt is the particle derivative and where F and\n\u03a6 account for the viscous force and corresponding dissipation and where k is the thermal conductivity.\nIn this section, we assemble -step by step- a set of\nself consistent criteria which are sufficient to derive the\nBoussinesq equations from the conservation equations\nabove. Since the successive approximations to derive\nBoussinesq equations are intricated, it is convenient to assume from the beginning that the density field is nearly\nhomogeneous, or more precisely that the following two\ncriteria are fulfilled (we omit the absolute values for better readability) :\n\u03c1h \u226a \u03c10\n\u03b4\u03c1 \u226a \u03c10\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nA preliminary thermodynamics relation\n\nUsing the generalised Mayer relation and defining \u03b3 =\ncp /cv , we note that :\n1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u22121 =\n\n\u03b1\u2206h\n\u03b12 T0\n=\n\u03c1cp \u03c7\n\u03c10 g\u03c7h\n\n(6)\n\nBoussinesq's approximation requires that the velocity\nfield is solenoidal (\u2207v = 0), which is satisfied if each\nterm in the right-hand side (RHS) of the previous equation can be neglected with respect to the typical velocity derivatives \u2202vi /\u2202xi of the left-hand side (LHS) \u2207v,\nwhere i \u2208 {x, y, z} :\n\u2202vi\nvz \u03c10 g\u03c7\n\u226a\n\u03b3\n\u2202xi\nD\u03b8\n\u2202vi\n\u03b1\n\u226a\nDt\n\u2202xi\n\nThis equation relates the density stratification resulting from two different contributions : \u03b1\u2206h is the thermal\nexpansion associated with the adiabatic-gradient and\n\u03c10 g\u03c7h is the compressibility associated with the hydrostatic pressure. Since \u03b3 is of order one or higher\n(critical point vicinity), this relation shows that the two\ncontributions are comparable in strength.\n\nD.\n\n(9a)\n(9b)\n\nEnergy conservation\n\nUsing the definitions Eq.(1) and (2), the energy conservation equation Eq.(4c) can be written :\nB.\n\nMomentum conservation\n\nUsing the definitions Eq.(1b) and (1c), the momentum\nconservation equation Eq.(4b) can be written :\n\u03c1\n\nDv\n= \u2212\u2207p + \u03b4\u03c1g + F \u2212 \u2207Ph + (\u03c10 + \u03c1h )g\nDt\n\nBy definition of Ph , the last two terms cancel out.

Such a \"significant\" feature is\npresent -for example- in the viscous term (dissipation)\nand, consequently, it cannot be neglected with respect to\nthe inertial term Dv/Dt, although the later is known to\nbe larger in turbulent regimes.\nC.\n\nMass conservation\n\nUsing the definition Eq.(1c), the mass conservation\nEq.(4a) can be written :\n\u2207v = \u2212\n\n1 D\u03c1\n1 D\u03b4\u03c1 vz d\u03c1h\n=\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03c1 Dt\n\u03c1 Dt\n\u03c1 dz\n\nUsing the definition Eq.(2c), the criteria Eq.(5) and\n(8), and the thermodynamics relation Eq.(6), we get :\n\u2207v \u2243 \u03b1\n\nD\u03b8 vz \u03c10 g\u03c7\n+\nDt\n\u03b3\n\n(11)\n\nvz g\u03b1\n[Th + \u03b8 (1 + \u03b1T0 )] \u226a \u0398\u2032\ncp\n\n(12a)\n(12b)\n(12c)\n\n2\n\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202 \u03b8\nwhere \u0398\u2032 \u2208 { \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202t , vi \u2202xi , \u03ba \u2202x2 }\ni\n\nIII.\n\nCRITERIA OF APPLICABILITY OF THE\nBOUSSINESQ'S APPROXIMATION\n\nIn this section, we evaluate the criteria (5), (8), (9) and\n(12) for the special case of high Ra (turbulent convection)\nand intermediate P r.\nTo check the first criterion Eq.(5a), the equations (2c)\nand (2b) could easily be solved exactly but an order-ofmagnitude solution for \u03c1h is enough for our purpose. Using also Eq.(6), we easily find that the criterion Eq.(5a)\nbecomes :\n\u03c10 gh\u03c7\n\u226a1\n\u03b3\n\nor\n\n\u03b1\u2206h\n\u226a1\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n(13)\n\nTo estimate the other criteria, we discriminate between\ntwo regions of the cell where the flow phenomenologies\n\n\f4\nare known to differ : the bulk and the boundary layers\nnear the top and bottom plates. Each criterion should be\nfulfilled in the two regions. Before proceeding with these\ntwo regions, it is useful to present order-of-magnitude fits\nof various quantities in the cell.\nA.\n\nFew orders of magnitude\n\nThe scalings of various flow quantities have been reported in the literature of turbulent convection, in particular in the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard cells. In this subsection,\nour aim is to present a few simple fits that will be used\nto estimate and compare the orders of magnitude of various contributions. We are not suggesting here that the\nchosen power law fits have an underlying physical meaning. We neglect the inhomogeneities within the boundary\nlayers and within the bulk of the flow, which result from\nfinite size effects e.g. confinement of the large scale circulation.\nBelow Ra = 1012 and for 0.7 < P r < 30, all reported\nN u(Ra) data are in reasonable agreement (for studies of\nboth Ra and P r in this range, see for example [17, 18,\n19, 20, 21]). We will use the fit :\n(Ra < 1012 ) N u \u2243 0.065Ra1/3\n\n(14)\n\nThe 1/3 exponent chosen in this fit is slightly larger than\nthe exponents fitted in most studies (which are closer to\n0.30-0.32), even when the temperature drop in plates is\ncompensated [22]. But this simple fit still provides good\nnumerical estimates for our purpose.\nAbove Ra = 1012 , the reported N u(Ra) dependence\nfall into two sets : data from 2 experiments roughly follows the scaling of Eq.(14) ([23, 24]) while the others exhibit a steep increase of the Ra exponent from 0.31 up to\ntypically 0.38 [25, 26, 27, 28].The enhanced-heat-transfer\nlaw can be fitted by :\n(1012 < Ra < 1014 ; P r \u2243 10) N u \u2243 0.015Ra0.38\nThe apparent incompatibility between the two sets of\ndata is not understood and motivates present research\n(see also the numerical results [29, 30]). Although all the\ndata showing a heat transfer enhancement (including\n[31]) are consistent with the \"ultimate regime\" predicted\nby R. Kraichnan [32], an extensive characterisation of\nthis new regime is still missing. Therefore, we will not\nattempt to derive specific Boussinesq criteria for it in\nthis paper. In the Discussion section, we will come back\non this point to discuss very high Ra experiments.\nA large scale circulation or \"wind\" is known to occur in\nRayleigh-B\u00e9nard cells. The strength of the l.s.c velocity\nvlsc can be characterised by the fit :\nhvlsc\n\u2243 0.15Ra1/2 P r\u22123/4\n(15)\n\u03bd\nwhich is a compromise between studies from various\ngroups [28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] conducted with various\nRe =\n\noperational definitions of Re for 0.7 < P r < 30, based\non local velocity or turn over time measurements [39].\nAn alternative estimate of the typical velocity in the\nbulk of the flow can be obtained from the rms velocity\nfluctuations. Comparing the fit of Re (above) with rms\nvelocity data from the literature [35, 37, 40, 41] we\nnote that the scaling of the root-mean-squared (rms)\nvelocity is approximately the same as the scaling of the\nlarge scale circulation velocity, and that the magnitudes\nare comparable (rms velocity is typically 40% of vlsc ).\nWe will therefore consider only a single characteristic\nvelocity at large scales. We should mention that, in\nthe literature, the Ra dependence of Re has been fitted\nwith effective exponents as low as 0.40 [35] (and even\n0.36 \u00b1 0.05 at some location in a square cell [42] ) and\nas high as 0.65 (in the horizontal plane [37]).\nMany consistent studies report scalings of the rms temperature fluctuations in the bulk of the cell versus Ra\n(for example see [23, 24, 43, 44, 45]) but, to our knowledge, only Daya and Ecke [40] reports both a Ra and\nP r dependence. The fit below is derived from Daya and\nEcke original data. We should mention that the reported\nP r dependence is poorly fitted by a power law but that\nsuch a fit still provides a fair order of magnitude for our\n\u22c6\npurpose. \u03b8rms\nis defined as the rms temperature fluctuations normalised by the temperature difference \u2206 across\nthe cell.\n\u22c6\n\u03b8rms\n\u2243 0.3Ra\u22120.13P r\u22120.5\n\n(16)\n\nFinally, we will need an estimate of the time derivative\n\u2202\u03b8/\u2202t in the bulk of the flow. The references [46, 47]\nreport corresponding measurements over a large range of\nRa (5.108 < Ra < 1015 ) for Prandtl numbers of order 110 (see also [45]). They interpret a transition occurring\nnear Ra \u223c 1011 with a change in power laws. Nevertheless, within a factor 2, we can still re-fit all their data\nwith the following power law, which is enough for our\npurpose (the Prandtl number dependence is unknown) :\n\u2202\u03b8/\u2202t \u2243 0.7Ra0.4\n\n\u2206\u03ba\nh2\n\nIn the bulk of the flow, we expect advection to be the\nmost effective heat transport mechanism, which implies\n\u2202\u03b8/\u2202t \u2243 v\u2207\u03b8. The relation shows that we can also estimate the time derivative from v\u2207\u03b8, taking v \u2243 \u03bdRe/h\nand using recent temperature-gradient measurements for\n109 < Ra < 1010 and P r \u2243 5.4 [48]. Averaging the\nmeasured gradient from the various locations inside the\ncell[48], we obtain the fit :\n\u2202\u03b8/\u2202t \u2243 v\u2207\u03b8 \u223c v|\u2207\u03b8| \u2243 70Ra\u22120.165 Re\n\n\u2206\u03bd\nh2\n\nIt is satisfactory that both estimations are in reasonable\nagreement (magnitude and Ra exponent). We will favour\nthe first fit because its has been validated over a wider\n\n\f5\nrange of Ra. It is convenient to define a dimensionless\n\u22c6\nderivative \u03b8\u2202t\nas :\n\u22c6\n\u03b8\u2202t\n=\n\n\u2202\u03b8 h2\n\u2243 0.7Ra0.4 x\n\u2202t \u2206\u03ba\n\np\u223c\n\n(17)\n\nwhere x = (P r/5)X accounts for the unknown Prandtl\ndependence through the unknown parameter X. For intermediate P r, we will assume that x is of order 1.\n\nB.\n\nand the second RHS term, a buoyant source of pressure\nvariation, can be estimated by integration as :\n\nSubstituting the expressions vlsc = \u03bdRe/h and \u03bb =\nh/2N u and using the fits for N u and Re, we find that the\nbuoyant contribution to the pressure is smaller than the\nkinematic contribution. Neglecting the former and using\nEq.(6), both criteria Eq.(18) becomes, up to a factor 2 :\n\nBoundary layer region\n\nThe present knowledge of scaling in the boundary\nlayers is not as extended as in the bulk, in particular\ndue to the complex interplay between the thermal and\nthe velocity boundary layers (for recent progresses, see\n[49, 50, 51]). Nevertheless, it is well established that\neach boundary layer concentrate nearly half of the total temperature drop \u2206 over a typical distance of order\n\u03bb = h/2N u. An internal velocity scale vbl can be obtained writing that total heat flux experiences a crossover within the thermal boundary layer from a molecular diffusion transport (right on the plate) to a convective transport at a distance \u03bb from the plate, which\ngives vbl = \u03ba/\u03bb = 2N u.\u03ba/h. An external velocity scale\nis also imposed on the thermal boundary layers by the\nlarge scale circulation present in the bulk of the cell\nvlsc = Re.\u03bd/h. Using the estimates of N u and Re given\npreviously, we note that vlsc > vbl . In the following, we\nwill choose the velocity scale which gives the more stringent criteria (\"sufficient conditions\"). Using these temperature, length and velocity scales, we evaluate below\nthe criterion (5b), (8), (9) and (12) .\nLocal thermodynamic equilibrium implies the differential equation :\n\n(20a)\n\nP rRe \u03b1\u2206h\n\u226a1\nRa 1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u22121\n\n(20b)\n\nThe second criterion Eq.(20b) is comparable or less\nstringent than Eq.(13), so we can drop it.\nIn the boundary layer, the next criterion Eq.(9a) is\nestimated as :\nv\u03c10 g\u03c7\nv\n\u226a\n\u03b3\n\u03bb\nAfter simplification by the typical velocity v and using\nthe expression of \u03bb, we find that the above condition\nis less stringent than the criterion Eq.(13). We will\ntherefore ignore it too.\nTo evaluate the criterion Eq.(9b) in the boundary\nlayer, the particle derivative of the temperature is estimated with a diffusion process (heat is indeed transferred between the plates and the fluid by diffusion in\nthe boundary layers) :\nD\u03b8\n\u2206/2\n\u2243 2\nDt\n\u03bb /\u03ba\n\nSubtracting the stratification contribution (2c) from\nthis local equilibrium, the criteria Eq.(5b) and (8) are\nfound to be equivalent to :\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u226a 1\n\u03c7p \u226a \u03b1\u03b8\n\n(18a)\n(18b)\n\nIn the boundary layer, we have \u03b8 \u223c \u2206/2. The order\nof magnitude of p is assessed taking the divergence of\nEq.(7) and using the solenoidal property of the velocity\nfield. We find a Poisson equation for the pressure :\n\u22072 p = \u2212\u03c10 \u2207 [(v\u2207) v] + \u03b1\u03c10 g\n\n\u03b1\u2206 \u226a 1\n2\n\nd\u03c1 = \u2212\u03c1\u03b1dT + \u03c1\u03c7dP\n\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202z\n\n(19a)\n\nThe first term of the RHS gives the usual dynamical pressure of order :\np\u223c\n\ng\u03c10 \u03b1\u2206\u03bb\n4\n\n\u03c10\n\u03c10\n(vbl 2 + vlsc 2 ) \u223c vlsc 2\n2\n2\n\n(21)\n\nand the space derivative of the velocity is estimated\nfrom the typical internal velocity as vbl /\u03bb. The external\nvelocity vlsc is not chosen because it would give a more\nloose condition. Substituting the expressions of D\u03b8/Dt,\nvbl and \u03bb in the criterion Eq.(9b) gives criterion Eq.(20a)\nagain.\nWe now consider the three criteria Eq.(12) associated\nwith the energy equation. The three RHS term \u0398\u2032 of\nthese inequalities can be estimated with the characteristic scales used above. All turn out to have the same\ntypical magnitude, as expected from the chosen boundary layer model :\n\u0398\u2032 \u2243\n\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u22022\u03b8\n\u03ba\u2206\n\u2243\u03ba 2 \u2243 2\n\u2243 vi\n\u2202t\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi\n2\u03bb\n\nWe estimate the LHS of the inequalities Eq.(12) using\n\n\f6\nvlsc as the typical velocity (\"sufficient condition\").\n\u03a6\n\u03bd \u0010 vlsc \u00112\n.\ncp\ncp\n\u03bb\n\u03b1T0 \u03c10 vlsc 2 /2\n\u03b1T0 Dp\n<\n\u03c10 cp Dt\n\u03c10 cp \u03bb/vlsc\n\u0014\n\u0015\nvlsc g\u03b1 \u2206h\nvz g\u03b1\n\u2206\n[Th + \u03b8 (1 + \u03b1T0 )] .\n+ (1 + \u03b1T0 )\ncp\ncp\n2\n2\nSubstituting the expressions of vlsc (Re) and \u03bb(N u) in\nthe previous equations, we find up to prefactors of order\nunity :\n\u2206h\n2P r2 Re2\n\u00d7\n\u226a1\nT0\nRa\nP r2 Re3\n\u03b1\u2206h \u00d7\n\u226a1\n\u0012\n\u0013 2RaN u\nP rRe\n\u2206h \u2206h\n\u226a1\n+ \u03b1T0 + 1 \u00d7\nT0\n\u2206\n4N u2\n\n(22a)\n(22b)\n(22c)\n\nThe second condition (22b) is comparable or more\nstringent than Eq.(13) and will replace it. The \u03b1T0 term\nin the parenthesis of Eq.(22c) gives a condition comparable or less severe than (22b) and can therefore be\ndropped. The unity term in the parenthesis gives a condition that can be compared to Eq.(22a) and it turns out\nto be typically up to 10 times more stringent for low Ra\n(Ra \u223c 107 ), comparable for Ra \u223c 1013 , and less stringent above. We will come back on these 2 conditions\nlater. The \u2206h /\u2206 term of Eq.(22c) gives the condition :\nP rRe\n\u22062h\n\u226a1\n\u00d7\nT0 \u2206 4N u2\nC.\n\n(23)\n\nBulk region\n\nIn the bulk, for the same reasons as in the boundary\nlayers, the criteria Eq.(5b) and (8) are equivalent to :\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u226a 1\n\u03c7p \u226a \u03b1\u03b8\nThe first condition is weaker than the criteria Eq.(20a)\nsince the magnitude of temperature fluctuations in the\nbulk is significantly smaller than the total temperature\n\u22c6\ndrop across the cell (\u03b8rms\n\u226a 1).\nTo assess the second condition, the magnitude of\nthe pressure p is estimated using the Poisson equation\nEq.(19). The buoyant contribution is estimated by analogy with electrostatic, \u03b1\u03c10 g\u2202\u03b8/\u2202z being the pressure\nsource with a negligible remote contribution from the\nboundary layers[63] and a local contribution from the\nbulk.\np.\n\n\u03c10 2\n\u2202\u03b8\nv + \u03b1\u03c10 g| |l2\n2\n\u2202z\n\nwhere l is a correlation length of the temperature gradi2\nent \u2202\u03b8/\u2202z in the bulk. The buoyant contribution | \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202z |l\ncan be estimated from the temperature rms fluctuation\n\u22c6\n\u2206\u03b8rms\n, the typical temperature derivative \u2202\u03b8/\u2202zi , and\nusing the inequality\n|\n\n\u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2206\u03b8rms\n\u2202\u03b8 2\n\u22c6\n|l < | |hl \u223c | |h\n\u223c h\u2206\u03b8rms\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z |\u2202\u03b8/\u2202z|\n\nEstimating the typical velocity as v = \u03bdRe/h and using\n\u22c6\nthe fit of Re and \u03b8rms\n, we find that the buoyant contribution to the pressure variation is comparable or smaller\nthan the kinematic term for Ra > 108 . We will ignore\nit. A sufficient condition for the criteria \u03c7p \u226a \u03b1\u03b8 in the\nbulk is therefore :\n\u03b1\u2206h\nP rRe2\n\u00d7\n\u226a1\n\u22121\n\u22c6\n1\u2212\u03b3\n2Ra\u03b8rms\n\n(24)\n\nThis new criterion is comparable to Eq.(22b). We\nchoose the new one because it is derived from tighter\nestimates.\nTo estimate the criteria Eq.(9a), we take vz \u223c \u03bdRe/h\nas the typical vertical velocity. The typical derivative\n\u2202vi /\u2202xi is estimated assuming that the velocity fluctuations in the bulk of the flow are driven by the large scale\ncirculation on a large scale h and follows a Kolmogorovlike cascade. Then, the energy injected into cascade is related to the viscous dissipation \u03a6, which is proportional\nto the square of velocity spatial derivatives ([52, 53]) :\n\u00132\n\u0012\n3\nvlsc\n\u03bd3\n\u2202vi\n= Re3 \u00d7 4 \u2243 \u03a6 \u223c \u03bd\n(25)\nh\nh\n\u2202xj\nfrom which we get the estimate :\n\u03bd\n\u2202vi\n\u223c Re3/2 2\n\u2202xi\nh\nUsing those estimates and Eq.(6), it is straightforward\nto show that Eq.(9a) in the bulk is less stringent than\nEq.(13). We can therefore ignore this condition. As\na comment, the LHS of Eq.(9a) has been estimated\nusing the magnitude of the velocity at large scales\nwhile the RHS has been estimated at small scales where\nthe derivative is known to be larger. The solenoidal\ncondition Eq.(9a) is nevertheless still accounted for at\nlarge scale only, as can be checked estimating the RHS\nas vlsc /h (one gets Eq.(13)).\nTo estimate the next criterion Eq.(9b), we need an\nupper bound for the particle derivative D\u03b8/Dt. We can\nconsider the relaxation by molecular diffusion of a \u03bb-thick\nplume of excess temperature \u2206/2. The result is the same\nas in the boundary layer : Eq.(21). The criterion Eq.(9b)\nbecomes in the bulk :\n2N u2\n\u03b1\u2206 \u226a 1\nP rRe3/2\nUsing typical fits Re(Ra), N u(Ra), we find that the\nprevious inequality is less severe than (20a) and can be\n\n\f7\nignored.\nWe now consider the three criteria Eq.(12) associated\nwith the energy equation. Boussinesq thermal equation\nEq.(11) states that the advection of temperature inhomogeneties is only affected by the molecular thermal diffusion. In the boundary layers, we showed that these two\ntransport processes have the same efficiency. In the bulk,\nwe expect advection to become the dominant process, except in some localised regions (on the thermals interface)\nwhere diffusion could be as efficient as in the boundary\nlayers. To estimate the three inequalities Eq.(12), we\nwill require that each LHS term is significantly smaller\n\u22c6\nthan the advection term v\u2207\u03b8 \u2243 \u2202\u03b8/\u2202t = \u03b8\u2202t\n\u2206\u03ba/h2 of\nthe RHS. It should be noted that the molecular diffusion term in the thermal equation provides a cut-off (or\n\"dissipation\") mechanism for temperature fluctuations at\nsmall scales and that we are not aiming to compare the\nmagnitude of this cut-off term with the LHS terms of\nEq.(12).\nTo estimate the LHS of the first thermal criterion\nEq.(12a), Eq.(25) provides an order of magnitude of\nthe viscous dissipation \u03a6 which is found consistent with\nthe Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results of Verzicco [41]. The criterion Eq.(12a) in the bulk becomes\nEq.(26a).\nTo estimate the next criterion Eq.(12b), we assume\nthat pressure and temperature fluctuates with similar\ntypical time scales. The derivatives Dp/Dt and \u2202\u03b8/\u2202t\nof Eq.(12b) are replaced with their integrated value p \u223c\n\u22c6\n. We find Eq.(26b).\n\u03c10 v 2 /2 and \u03b8 \u223c \u2206\u03b8rms\nTo estimate the LHS of the third thermal criterion\n\u22c6\nEq.(12c), we take vz \u223c Re.\u03bd/h, \u03b8 \u223c \u2206\u03b8rms\nand Th \u223c\n\u2206h /2 to find Eq.(26c).\n\u2206h\nP r2 Re3\n\u00d7\n\u226a1\n\u22c6\nT0\nRa\u03b8\u2202t\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2206h\n\u2206h\n\u22c6\nT0 2\u2206\u03b8rms\n\nP rRe2\n\u226a1\n\u03b1\u2206h \u00d7\n\u22c6\n2Ra\u03b8rms\n\u0015\n\u22c6\nP rRe\u03b8rms\n+ \u03b1T0 + 1 \u00d7\n\u226a1\n\u22c6\n\u03b8\u2202t\n\n(26a)\n(26b)\n(26c)\n\n\u22c6\nUsing the typical orders of magnitude of Re, \u2206\u03b8rms\n\u22c6\nand \u03b8\u2202t , we now compare these three thermal conditions\nEq.(26) with previous ones. The first condition is less\nstringent than Eq.(22c) (unity term) at low Ra and more\nstringent than Eq.(22a) at high Ra. We choose to drop\nthe condition Eq.(22a) and to merge Eq.(22c) (unity term\nonly) and Eq.(26a) into :\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206h\nP rRe P r2 Re3\n\u226a1\n(27)\n\u00d7\n+\n\u22c6\nT0\n4N u2\nRa\u03b8\u2202t\n\nUp to a numerical factor (1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u22121 ) of order one, the\nsecond thermal condition Eq.(26b) is equivalent to the\ncriterion (24). We now consider one by one each term in\nthe brackets of Eq.(26c). The unity term gives a condition which is less stringent than Eq.(27). The \u03b1T0 term\n\ngives a condition less stringent than Eq.(26b) and can be\n\u22c6\nignored. The \u2206h /\u2206\u03b8rms\nterm gives a condition comparable, or more stringent for high Ra, than Eq.(23).

The other criteria\nare more difficult to relate to a specific physical effect.\nFor example, the complete heat equation has a term\naccounting for the thermo-mechanical energy coupling\nwhich directly results from stratification [64]. This\nterm -which appears on the LHS of Eq.(12c)- gives\ncontributions proportional to \u03b1\u2206h , \u2206h /T0 and \u22062h /T0 \u2206.\nThe fourth criterion above accounts for the \u22062h /T0 \u2206\ncontribution alone. The third criterion above includes\nthe \u2206h /T0 contribution but also another condition\nnecessary to neglect the viscous dissipation with respect\nto advected heat flux. The second criterion above allows\nto neglect variations of density due to the pressure\nvariations, versus those due to temperature variations\n(Eq.(24). It also allows to neglect the cooling/heating\nassociated with the pressure variations experienced by a\nfluid particle in the heat transport equation (Eq.(22b)\nand Eq.(26b)).\nThese 4 criteria don't allow to assess a-priori the fulfilment of the Boussinesq approximation for given Ra and\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\nP r since it requires some knowledge of Re, \u03b8\u2202t\nand \u03b8rms\n.\nA further step in the analysis consists in replacing these\n\n\f8\nquantities by fits versus Ra and P r. For example, using the fits presented previously, the 4 previous criteria\nbecomes :\n\u03b1\u2206 \u226a 1 (30a)\n0.1Ra\n\n0.13\n\n(\u03b1\u2206h ) \u226a 1\n(30b)\n\n\u0014\n\nRa\n\n0.1\n\n\u22120.25\n\nPr\n200\n\nx\n\n\u0015\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2206h\n\u226a 1 (30c)\nT0\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u2206h\n\u226a1\n0.1Ra0.1 P r0.25 x\nT0 \u2206\n(30d)\n\n+ 10Ra\u22120.17P r0.25\n\nwhere we rounded prefactors and exponents to recall\nthat the above inequalities are derived from order-ofmagnitude fits. We recall that the order of magnitude\nof x is taken as unity for P r of order 1-10.\nThese equations highlight parameters having a direct\ninfluence on the validity of the Boussinesq approximation. For example, the dependence versus Ra is very\nweak. The equations Eq.(30) indicates that high Ra\nare weakly unfavourable but the uncertainty in the fits'\nexponents prevents from drawing precise conclusions on\nthis weak dependence. For given Ra and P r, we found\ngeneral features. Tall cells are unfavourable because of\nstratification (linear and quadratic dependence versus h\ncoming from \u2206h ). Close proximity to the critical point\nis unfavourable too since \u03b1 has a strong divergence in a\nregion where \u2206h stays approximately constant. Finally,\nlarge temperature differences \u2206 have opposite influence\non the criterion Eq.(30a) (unfavourable) and on the\ncriterion Eq.(30d) (favourable). In practice all these\nparameters can't all be varied independently.\nNumerical applications are now proposed for a few\ntypical laboratory Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard cells. Let's first consider a water cell of height h = 1 m, mean temperature\nT0 = 50\u25e6 C and driven with \u2206 = 30\u25e6 C (near atmospheric\npressure). Such cells are being studied -for example- in\nphysics labs in Lyon, Hong-Kong and Santa Barbara\n(for example see [54, 55, 56]). We found that the criteria\nEq.(30) are all fulfilled. The most stringent one is by far\nEq.(30a), which is nevertheless still valid with 2 decades\nseparation between the two sides of the inequality. The\nthree other criteria are fulfilled with at least 5 decades\nof separation.\nIn h = 8 m air cell at atmospheric pressure, such as\nthe one operated in Ilmenau (for example see [57]), we\nalso find that the first criterion Eq.(30a) is the most\nstringent. For \u2206 = 50\u25e6 C and T0 = 50\u25e6 C, we find\na ration 6 separation between the two sides of this\ninequality. The other criteria are fulfilled with 2.5 or\nmore decades of separation.\nAlthough atmospheric convection differs from RB\nconvection of dry air, it is interesting the examine\n\nthe criteria Eq.(30) for h = 10 km, \u2206 = 50 C and\nT0 = 0\u25e6 C. Using dry air properties, we find that\nEq.(30b) is violated by more than one decade and than\nthe LHS of Eq.(30c) is close to 1, indicating that the\nBoussinesq approximation is not valid in this academic\ncase. Surely these numbers should be taken with much\ncaution because they rely on the extrapolation up to\nRa \u2243 2.1021 of fits derived at much lower Ra and\nprobably in a different turbulent regime.\nThe case of Helium cells, such as those being operated\nin Grenoble and Trieste cannot be addressed with the\nsame general procedure as above because, from one run\nto another, the temperature and the fluid density are varied and the parameter \u03b1 does change accordingly (while\n\u2206h /h remains close to 2.10\u22123 - 3.10\u22123 Km\u22121 ). Besides,\nthe modelling presented in this paper ignores the possibility of occurrence of the Kraichnan's ultimate regime\nof convection [32], while the interpretation of some high\nRa data is done according to this regime. These words of\ncaution written, we can still get guidelines from the derived criteria. We numerically find that the two first criteria Eq.(30a) and Eq.(30b) are the most stringent ones,\nwhile the two others are fulfilled by at least 3 orders of\nmagnitude for cells of height 20 cm and 1 m Therefore,\nwe focus below on the validity of the second criterion for\nexperimental data fulfilling the first one.\nData from [24, 25, 26] have been corrected from the\nside wall effect [58, 59, 60] and filtered to reject those\nwith \u03b1\u2206 > 0.2, that is a 10% maximum relative variation\nof the density in each boundary layer (first criterion). All\ncells are cylindrical and their height and aspect ratio \u0393 =\ndiameter/height are reported in the legend of figure 1.\nThe top plot shows the LHS of the criterion Eq.(30b)\n\u22c6\nversus Ra. We recall here that the fit of \u03b8rms\nused to\nderive Eq.(30b) from Eq.(29b) is smooth over nearly 6\ndecades, up to nearly Ra = 1015 and that we assume that\nits extrapolation over one extra decade (up to Ra = 1016 )\nprovides a correct order of magnitude. From the plot, we\nfind that this non-Boussinesq parameter reaches values\nlarger than 0.2 for the highest Ra (Ra \u223c 1016 ), which\nmay no longuer be considered as significantly smaller\nthan unity. This suggests that Boussinesq approximation could be violated for such ultra high Ra.\nBesides, this shows that increasing the He cell height h\nto reach higher Ra -in Boussinesq conditions- is at best\nefficient like h2 and not h3 . Indeed, if we neglect the\nweak Ra dependence of Eq.(30b) and increase by a factor -say- 10 the cell height, \u03b1 should be 10 times smaller\nfor \u03b1\u2206h to stay constant (fulfilment of Eq.(30b)). On the\nother hand, \u2206 can be made 10 times larger (fulfilment of\nEq.(29a)). In temperature-density area where these high\nRa data are obtained, a 10 fold decrease of \u03b1 is roughly\ncorrelated with a 10 fold increase of the thermal diffusivity but with little change in the kinematic viscosity. All\nparameters considered, the maximum \"Boussinesq\" Ra\nwill only be 100 times larger. One the other hand, this\nimplies that such tall cells could be interesting models\n\n\f9\nE.\n\nConclusion and Perspectives\n\nWe derived a set of 4 criteria (Eq.(29)) for assessing\nthe applicability of Boussinesq approximation in a fluid\nwith constant properties at high Rayleigh number Ra\nand intermediate P r. The fourth criterion, scaling\nquadratically with stratification, was found to be always\nless stringent than the 3 others in our numerical estimations.\nThe first criterion \u03b1\u2206 \u226a 1 simply reflects the incompressibility condition in the boundary layers. The\n3 others are indirectly associated with stratification\neffects. They are written as functions of the adiabatic\ngradient but the thermodynamics relation Eq.(6) allows\nto translate them into equivalent density stratification\ncriteria. Contrary to a widespread idea, tall cells are not\nnecessarily more Boussinesq than small ones for given\nRa and P r, because of these stratification effects.\nUsing fits derived from the RB literature, we found\nthat the first criterion \u03b1\u2206 \u226a 1 is the most relevant one\nfor assessing the \"Boussinesqness\" of typical laboratory\nexperiments conducted with water and air. In geophysical flows for which stratification occurs on very large\nscales, the second and third criteria could become more\nrelevant than the first one.\nFIG. 1: Data from three cryogenic He experiments[24, 25, 26],\nrestricted to those fulfilling \u03b1\u2206 < 0.2. The top plot shows the\nparameter appearing on the left of the Boussinesq criterion\nEq.(30b). The Boussinesq condition is better fulfilled for the\nvalues of the parameter smaller than one (the Chavanne et al.\ndata near Ra \u223c 1012 sitting below 10\u22124 have been obtained\nin liquid helium). The bottom plot shows the compensated\nNusselt N uRa\u22121/3 versus Ra. We note that, for Ra \u223c 1013\n(vertical line), the datasets already sits on different N u(Ra)\ntrends while some of their non Boussinesq parameters, displayed on the top plot, roughly overlap.\n\nfor atmospheric convection. Indeed, according to the estimate presented above we expect a similar violation of\nthe Boussinesq approximation in the atmosphere.\nThe bottom plot of this figure illustrates that the\ncompensated Nusselt N uRa\u22121/3 has different trends for\nRa > 1012 as mentioned earlier in the text. Regarding this issue, the top plot also shows that the nonBoussinesq parameter is below 10\u22122 for Ra \u223c 1013 and\n-more important- that it is approximately the same for\ndatasets with different N u(Ra) trends (the vertical line\nacross the plots illustrates this point). This shows that\nnon-Boussinesq deviations of the sort encompassed by\nthe present analysis cannot explain the discrepancy of\nheat transfer efficiency among He cells for 1012 < Ra <\n1014 [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31].\n\nIn cryogenic helium, in addition to the first criterion,\nthe validity of second one (Eq.(29b)) deserves to be carefully examined at ultra high Ra, above 1016 typically.\nThis point and its consequences on very high Ra experiments is discussed in the text. At such high Ra, this\nsecond criterion is a sufficient condition for density fluctuations in the bulk to be more correlated to temperature\nfluctuations than to pressure fluctuations (Eq.(24)) and\nto neglect, in the heat equation, a thermal heat source\n(or sink) term due to pressure-fluctuation-induced compression (or expansion) (Eq.(26b)).\nAt lower Rayleigh numbers (typically 1012 < Ra <\n1014 ), we find that the apparent incompatibility of heat\ntransfer measurements reported in literature cannot be\nexplained by such non-Boussinesq effects.\nIn the Boussinesq approximation, the equations of the\nfluid are only parametrised by Ra and P r. The present\nwork shows that a weaker approximation of the equations\n-preserving some terms proportional to the parameters\n\u03b1\u2206 and/or \u03b1\u2206h (or equivalently \u03c7\u03c1gh)- would enable to\naccount for first deviations from the Boussinesq limit of\nturbulent Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard cells filled with a fluid with\nconstant properties. As a perspective, a DNS simulation\nconducted with such generalised equations at moderate\nturbulent Rayleigh numbers (say 108 < Ra < 1010 ) but\nwith large enough values of the non-Boussinesq parameters \u03b1\u2206 or \u03b1\u2206h would provide valuable quantitative information on deviations from the Boussinesq limit. In\nparticular, simulation with \u03b1\u2206h of order unity can still\n\n\f10\nbe performed assuming incompressibility. Such simulations would give a precise quantitative meaning on the\n\u226a symbol used in the proposed Boussinesq criteria.\nAcknowledgments\n\ntions, Q.
