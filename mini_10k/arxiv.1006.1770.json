From\nBrill-Noether Theory, it is known that X has finitely many linear systems gdr\nand that the natural associated 0-dimensional\nWdr parameterizing those\nQr scheme\ni!\nlinear systems is reduced and has \u03bb = g! i=0 (g\u2212d+r+i)! points.\nIn [4], a new method for considering Brill-Noether problems is introduced\nusing linear systems on graphs. In particular, one obtains a metric graph \u0393\nof genus g having exactly \u03bb linear systems gdr . In a degeneration from smooth\ncurves of genus g to a singular curve of genus g with dual graph equal to \u0393, the\nresults from [2] imply that the generic curve X has finitely many linear systems\ngdr . However, it is not clear whether all linear systems gdr on X have different\nspecializations on \u0393 (see [4, Conjecture 1.5]). In this note we solve this problem\nfor the case r = 1.\nIn [5], the specialization from curves to graphs is studied for the situation\nof real curves. In particular, in that situation, the graph \u0393 has a real structure\ncompatible to the real structure on the curves and real linear systems on the\ncurves specialize to real linear systems on the graph. Using suited lengths for\nthe edges of the graph \u0393 mentioned before, it is possible to introduce two real\nstructures on \u0393, including the trivial one. Using the previous results, we obtain\nthe existence of real curves of genus g having exactly \u03bb linear systems gd1 all of\nthem being real (using the trivial structure) and having less than \u03bb real linear\nsystems gd1 (using the non-trivial structure) in case g \u2265 6. In this second case,\nthe number \u03bb0 of real linear systems gd1 can be computed and it turns out that\n\u03bb0 /\u03bb becomes 0 for g \u2192 \u221e.\nThe existence of real curves having \u03bb real linear systems gd1 also follows from\ndegenerations to real rational cuspidal curves using [9] and it is proved using the\ntheory of limit linear systems in [7]. In general, one has the following problem:\ndetermine all values \u03bb0 \u2261 \u03bb (mod 2) such that there exists a real curve X having\n\u2217 Katholieke Hogeschool Kempen, Departement IBW, Kleinhoefstraat 4, B-2440 Geel, Belgium; K.U.Leuven, Department of Mathematics, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; email: marc.coppens@khk.be\n\u2020 K.U.Leuven, Department of Mathematics, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium;\nemail: filip.cools@wis.kuleuven.be\n\n1\n\n\fexactly \u03bb linear systems gd1 with exactly \u03bb0 of them being real. The non-trivial\nreal structure shows that \u03bb0 can become much smaller than \u03bb. It should be\nnoted that from the result in [6], it follows that one cannot obtain the existence\nof real curves with \u03bb0 6= \u03bb using degenerations to real cuspidal rational curves.\nIn case g is not of the type 2n \u2212 2, then \u03bb is even and the smallest possible\nvalue of \u03bb0 could be 0. Using the intersection of a general real cubic surface\nand a general real quadric containing no real lines, it is easy to find real curves\nof genus 4 having no real g31 . In [3], it is proved that there exist real curves of\ngenus 8 having no real linear system g51 . At the moment, those seem to be the\nonly known cases with \u03bb0 = 0.\n\n2\n\nLinear pencils on metric graphs\n\nLet G be a finite connected graph, possibly with multiple edges, but without\nloops. Denote by V (G) the set of vertices of G and by E(G) the set of edges\nof G. Assume that a real positive number `(e) is assigned to each edge e. If\nwe identify each edge e \u2208 E(G) with a line segment [0, `(e)], we get a compact\nconnected metric space \u0393, which is the metric graph associated to G. The genus\ng of \u0393 is defined as |E(G)| \u2212 |V (G)| + 1, i.e. the first Betti number of G, where\nG is any underlying graph.\nA divisor D = n1 v1 + . . . + nt vt on \u0393 is an element of the free abelian\ngroup Div(\u0393) on the points of the metric graph \u0393. The degree of D is the\nsum n1 + . . . + nt of the coefficients and D is effective if each coefficient ni\nis nonnegative. Often, the terminology of chips is used when one deals with\ndivisors on graphs, e.g. we say that the divisor D has k chips at v if the\ncoefficient of v in D is equal to k.\nLet \u03c8 : \u0393 \u2192 R be a continuous map such that \u03c8 is piecewise linear with\nfinitely many pieces and\nP with integer slopes on each edge of \u0393. The divisor\ndiv(\u03c8) of \u03c8 is equal to v\u2208\u0393 ordv (\u03c8), where ordv (\u03c8) is the sum of the incoming slopes of \u03c8 at v \u2208 \u0393. We say that two divisors D and D0 are equivalent if\nand only if D0 \u2212 D = div(\u03c8) for some continuous map \u03c8 on \u0393, and in this case,\nwe write D \u223c D0 . The set |D| of all effective divisors D0 equivalent with D is the\nlinear system corresponding to D. The rank r(D) of |D| or D is defined as follows. If |D| = \u2205, then r(D) = \u22121, otherwise r(D) \u2265 r if and only if |D \u2212 E| =\n6 \u2205\nfor each effective divisor E on \u0393 of degree r. For a more elaborate introduction\nto linear systems on metric graphs (e.g. the notion of the v-reduced divisor of\n|D|), we refer to [4].\nLinear systems on metric graphs seem to obey analogous results as linear\nsystems on algebraic curves, e.g. Riemann-Roch Theorem. In [2], Baker conjectures that also the following counterpart of the Brill-Noether Theorem holds\nand he proves the first part.\nTheorem 2.1 (Brill-Noether Theorem for metric graphs). Fix g, r, d \u2265 0 and\nset \u03c1 = g \u2212 (r + 1)(g \u2212 d + r).\n\n2\n\n\f(1) If \u03c1 \u2265 0, then every metric graph \u0393 of genus g has a divisor D of rank\nr(D) = r and degree deg(D) \u2264 d.\n(2) If \u03c1 < 0, then there exists a metric graph \u0393 of genus g for which there\ndoes not exist a divisor D of rank r(D) = r and degree deg(D) \u2264 d.\nThe second part was proved in [4] using the following metric graph. Let\nGg be the graph consisting of g loops that are connected via 4-valent vertices\nv1 , . . . , vg\u22121 and such that in addition, the first and the last loop also contain one\n2-valent node each, respectively v0 and vg . Assume that \u0393 is the corresponding\nmetric graph where the lengths `i and mi of the two edges from vi\u22121 to vi are\ngeneric for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , g} (it suffices to take `i = ` \u2265 2g \u2212 2 and mi = 1 for\nall i). In [4] is proved that such metric graphs are Brill-Noether general.\n\nv0\n\nv1\n\nv2\n\nv3\n\nv4\n\nv5\n\nFigure 1: the graph G5\nWe will now focuss on the case of linear pencils on \u0393, thus r = 1. If g is\neven and d = g2 + 1 (so \u03c1 = 0), it is proven in [4] that there is a bijection\nbetween lattice paths p = (p0 , . . . , pg ) in Z satisfying p0 = pg = 1, pi \u2265 1 and\npi \u2212 pi\u22121 = \u00b11 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , g} and linear pencils of degree d on \u0393 as\nfollows. If p = (p0 , . . . , pg ) is a path satisfying the conditions, let Dp be the\ndivisor on \u0393 with one chip in v0 , one (extra) chip on the unique point wi of the\nith loop satisfying pi\u22121 vi\u22121 + wi \u223c pi vi if pi \u2212 pi\u22121 = 1 and no (extra) chips on\nthe ith loop if pi \u2212 pi\u22121 = \u22121. Note that Dp is v0 -reduced. The bijection maps\np to the linear system |Dp |. So the number of linear pencils on \u0393 is equal to the\n\u0001\nCatalan number \u03bb = d1 2d\u22122\nd\u22121 .\nProposition 2.2. Let Dp be a divisor on \u0393 corresponding to a lattice path\np = (p0 , . . . , pg ). Then the linear system |2Dp | has rank equal to two.\nProof. Since it is clear that |2Dp | has rank at least two, it suffices to prove that\n|2Dp \u2212 2v0 \u2212 vg | = \u2205. Let Qi be the divisor attained from 2Dp \u2212 2v0 by moving\nas many chips as possible from the first i loops of \u0393 to vi , for each i \u2208 {0, . . . , g}.\nDenote by qi the number of chips of Qi in vi . We claim that qi = pi \u2212 1 for each\ni and we will prove this by induction on i.\nFor i = 0, the divisor Q0 = 2Dp \u2212 2v0 and thus q0 = 0 = p0 \u2212 1 since Dp\nhas exactly one chip in v0 . Now assume the claim holds for i, hence qi = pi \u2212 1.\nIf pi+1 \u2212 pi = \u22121, the divisor Qi+1 is attained from Qi by moving the qi chips\nin vi as much as possible to vi+1 . Since the edge lengths are general, only\nqi \u2212 1 = pi \u2212 2 = pi+1 \u2212 1 chips end up in vi+1 . If pi+1 \u2212 pi = 1, the divisor Qi\nhas qi chips in vi and 2 chips at the point wi+1 of the (i + 1)th loop satisfying\npi vi + wi+1 \u223c pi+1 vi+1 , so only (qi + 2) \u2212 1 = pi = pi+1 \u2212 1 chips end up in\nvi+1 . In both cases, we have qi+1 = pi+1 \u2212 1.\n3\n\n\fThe statement of the proposition now follows from the claim for i = g, since\nthe vg -reduced divisor Qg in |2D \u2212 2v0 | has qg = pg \u2212 1 = 0 chips in vg .\nAssume that the metric graph \u0393 has integer edge lengths (thus `i , mi \u2208 Z).\nLet G be the graph corresponding to \u0393 with `(e) = 1 for each e \u2208 E(G), so G\nis a refinement of Gg . Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring with field\nof fractions Q and algebraically closed residue field k. Then [2, Appendix B]\nimplies that there exists a regular arithmetic surface X \u2192 R whose generic fiber\nis a smooth curve X \u2192 Q and whose special fiber Xk has dual graph equal to\nG. Following [2, Section 2], the specialization map\n\u03b1 : Div(X) \u2192 Div(G)\nsends effective (resp. principal) divisors to effective (resp. principal) divisors.\nHereby, Div(G) is the subgroup of Div(\u0393) consisting of divisors supported at\nV (G). Let Q be the algebraic closure of Q. The map \u03b1 can be extended to a\nmap\n\u03c4\u2217 : Div(X(Q)) \u223c\n= Div(XQ ) \u2192 Div(\u0393)\nsatisfying\nr(\u03c4\u2217 (E)) \u2265 dim(|E|)\nfor each E \u2208 Div(XQ ). This inequality implies that also XQ is Brill-Noether\ngeneral, but it is not clear wether each divisor on \u0393 of rank r and degree d lifts\nto a divisor of rank r and degree d on XQ (see [4, Conjecture 1.5]). Here we\nsolve this problem for the case where r = 1 and \u03c1 = 0.\nTheorem 2.3. If g is even and d =\na unique linear pencil gd1 on XQ .\n\ng\n2\n\n+ 1, each linear pencil |Dp | on \u0393 lifts to\n\nProof. If |E| would be a multiple gd1 on XQ , then it follows from the description\nof the tangent map to Wd1 and the base point free pencil trick (see [1, Chapter\nIV, Section 4 and Chapter III, Section 3]) that dim(|2E|) \u2265 3. This would imply\nthat |E| specializes to a linear pencil |Dp | on \u0393 satisfying\nr(2Dp ) = r(\u03c4\u2217 (2E)) \u2265 dim(|2E|) \u2265 3,\nwhich is in contradiction with Proposition 2.2. So the scheme Wd1 of XQ consists\n\u0001\nof exactly \u03bb = d1 2d\u22122\nd\u22121 points.\nAssume two different linear pencils |E1 | and |E2 | on XQ specialize to the\nsame linear pencil |Dp on \u0393. Then dim(|E1 + E2 |) \u2265 3 and r(2Dp ) = 2, but on\nthe other hand\nr(2Dp ) = r(\u03c4\u2217 (E1 + E2 )) \u2265 dim(|E1 + E2 |),\nso we have a contradiction.\nSince the graph \u0393 has exactly \u03bb pencils gd1 , it follows that \u03c4\u2217 induces a\nbijection between linear pencils gd1 on XQ and on \u0393.\n4\n\n\fAssume `i = ` and mi = 1 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , g} and identify the two edges\nof \u0393 between vi\u22121 and vi with intervals Ii = [0, 1] and Ji = [0, `]. In this case,\nthere is a non-trivial involution \u03c3 on \u0393 sending x \u2208 Ii to 1 \u2212 x \u2208 Ig\u2212i and x \u2208 Ji\nto ` \u2212 x \u2208 Jg\u2212i . Note that the only fixed point of this involution is vg/2 .\nProposition 2.4. Let p = (p0 , . . . , pg ) be a lattice path corresponding to a\ndivisor Dp of rank one on \u0393. Denote by \u03c3(p) the lattice path (pg , . . . , p0 ).\n(i) Dp \u223c \u03c3(D\u03c3(p) ).\n(ii) The linear system |Dp | is invariant under \u03c3 if and only if p = \u03c3(p).\nProof. Define fi for all i \u2208 {0, . . . , g} inductively by f0 = 0 and\n(\nfi\u22121 + pi\u22121 if pi \u2212 pi\u22121 = 1\nfi =\nfi\u22121 + pi\nif pi \u2212 pi\u22121 = \u22121\nLet f : \u0393 \u2192 R be the function defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif x \u2208 Ii\n\uf8f2fi\u22121 + pi\u22121 .x\nf (x) = fi\u22121\nif x \u2208 [0, ` \u2212 pi\u22121 ] \u2282 Ji\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nfi\u22121 + x \u2212 (` \u2212 pi\u22121 ) if x \u2208 [` \u2212 pi\u22121 , `] \u2282 Ji\nif pi \u2212 pi\u22121 = 1 and\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2fi\u22121 + pi .x\nf (x) = fi\u22121 + x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nfi\u22121 + pi\n\nif x \u2208 Ii\nif x \u2208 [0, pi ] \u2282 Ji\nif x \u2208 [pi , `] \u2282 Ji\n\nif pi \u2212 pi\u22121 = \u22121. It is clear that f is a piecewise linear with f (vi ) = fi and one\ncan see that div(f ) = \u03c3(D\u03c3(p) ) \u2212 D, hence Dp \u223c \u03c3(D\u03c3(p) ).\nIf the linear system |Dp | is invariant under \u03c3, then \u03c3(D\u03c3(p) ) \u2208 |Dp | implies\nthat D\u03c3(p) \u2208 |Dp |. Since Dp and D\u03c3(p) are both v0 -reduced divisors in |Dp |,\nthey must be equal, hence p = \u03c3(p).\nNow assume p = \u03c3(p), hence \u03c3(Dp ) \u2208 |Dp |. Let E be an arbitrary divisor in\n|Dp |, so there exists a piecewise linear function \u03c8 : \u0393 \u2192 R such that div(\u03c8) =\nE \u2212 Dp . If we apply the involution \u03c3 to this equation, we get that div(\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c3) =\n\u03c3(div(\u03c8)) = \u03c3(E \u2212 Dp ) = \u03c3(E) \u2212 \u03c3(Dp ), hence \u03c3(E) \u223c \u03c3(Dp ) \u223c Dp , so\n\u03c3(E) \u2208 |Dp | and |Dp | is invariant under the involution.\nThis implies that the number \u03bb0 of linear pencils on \u0393 that are invariant\nunder \u03c3 is equal to the number of symmetric lattice paths. This number can be\ncomputed as follows. Using Andr\u00e9's reflection method (see [8]), one can see that\nthe number of symmetric lattice paths p = (p0 , . . . , pg ) with pg/2 = m (where\nm \u2208 {1, . . . , d} with m \u2261 d mod 2) is equal to\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nd\nm\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\n=\n\u2212\n,\nd\u2212m\nd\u2212m\nd d\u2212m\n2\n2\n2 \u22121\n5\n\n\fhence \u0001\u03bb0 is the sum of these numbers and equals the central binomial coefficient\nd\u22121\n.

We are going to explain that those arguments also imply\nthat the degeneration respects complex conjugation of linear systems.\nLet R be a complete discrete valuation ring defined over R having residue\nfield R and let X \u2192 R be a regular arithmetic surface such that the generic\nfiber X is smooth and geometrically irreducible. Let Q be the quotient field\nof R, then QC = Q \u2297R C is a field (see [5, Lemma 5.1]). Let RC be the complete valuation ring extending R in QC and let XC \u2192 RC be obtained by base\nchange. We assume the special fiber X0,C (which is defined over R) is strongly\nsemistable. This means X0,C is reduced, all singular points of X0,C are nodes\nand its irreducible components are smooth. Associated to X0,C , there is a dual\ngraph G and this dual graph has a real structure defined by the real structure\non X0,C .\nLet D be a divisor on the generic fiber XC and let D be the conjugated\ndivisor. This means D = \u03c3(D), where \u03c3 is the involution on XC induced by\nthe field extension Q \u2282 QC . Considering XC \u2282 XC , one has closures cl(D) and\ncl(D) and one has cl(D) = cl(D) (in the right hand side of this equality, the\nconjugation is induced by the field extension R \u2282 C because X is defined over\nR).\nr\nLet Q be the algebraic closure of Q and let Q be the real closure. We\nr\nobtain a field extension Q \u2282 Q of degree 2. On X = X \u00d7Q Q, it defines an\ninvolution \u03c3 and if D is a divisor on X, then we write D to denote \u03c3(D). The\nr\ndivisor D + D is defined over Q . In particular, there exists a finite extension\nr\nQ \u2282 K with K \u2282 Q such that D + D is defined over K and D is defined over\nK \u2297R C = KC . Let RK (resp. RK,C ) be the extension of R in K (resp. KC ) and\nconsider the base extensions X \u00d7R RK and X \u00d7R RK,C . It is proved in [5] that\nthere exists a family XK \u2192 RK defined over R such that by base change we\nobtain a desingularization XK,C \u2192 RK,C of X \u00d7R RK,C , the special fiber X0,K,C\nis strongly semistable and its graph GK with the associated real stucture has\na natural weighted structure such that the associated metric graph is equal to\n\u0393 with its real structure. The associated divisor on GK defines a divisor \u03c4\u2217 (D)\non \u0393 and one has \u03c4\u2217 (D) = \u03c4\u2217 (D) on \u0393. In case D = D, these arguments are\nexplained in full detail in [5] showing that \u03c4\u2217 (D) is a real divisor on \u0393 in that\ncase.\n\n6\n\n\fWe consider the metric graph \u0393 used in the proof of Proposition 2.4. It has\ntwo real structures: the trivial one and the one defined by \u03c3. From [5, Proposition 5.9], it follows that both real structures can be obtained from a degeneration\nwith X0,C a totally degenerated curve. This means that all components of X0,C\nhave genus 0, in particular g(X0,C ) = g(X) = g(\u0393) = g. Now assume such a\ndegeneration is chosen.\nProposition 3.1. The specialization induces a bijection between the set of real\nlinear systems gd1 on X and the set of real linear systems gd1 on \u0393.\nProof. Theorem 2.3 implies that the specialization map induces a bijection between the sets of all linear systems gd1 . From [5], it follows that under the specialization a real gd1 on X corresponds to a real gd1 on \u0393. In case g is a non-real gd1\non X, then g and g are two different linear systems on X, hence \u03c4\u2217 (g) 6= \u03c4\u2217 (g).\nUsing the equality \u03c4\u2217 (g) = \u03c4\u2217 (g) mentioned above, we get \u03c4\u2217 (g) 6= \u03c4\u2217 (g), hence\n\u03c4\u2217 (g) is non-real on \u0393.\nUsing Proposition 2.4 in the case the real structure on \u0393 is induced by \u03c3 and\nusing a general specialization of the generic fiber of X \u2192 R to a complex curve\nX of genus g defined over R, we obtain the following.\nTheorem 3.2. There exist smooth complex curves X defined over R of genus\ng = 2d\u22122 having exactly \u03bb linear systems gd1 such that all of them (resp. exactly\n\u03bb0 of them) are real.\nRemark 3.3. In case the real structure on \u0393 is induced by \u03c3, we can say a\nlittle bit more about the structure of the real curve. We can choose X0,C such\nthat the component Cg/2 corresponding to vg/2 has a non-empty real locus or\nan empty real locus. The other components are obtained from pairs of disjoint\ncomplex conjugated copies of P1 . In the first case, the deformation is a smooth\nreal curve of genus g having exactly one connected component in the real locus.\nIn the second case, we obtain a real curve with an empty real locus. In the\ncase of real curves with empty real locus, there exist two types of linear systems\ninvariant under complex conjugation distinguished by the fact whether or not\nthey contain a real divisor. Unfortunately, using our methods, we are not able\nto distinguish between those possibilities.\n\nReferences\n[1] E. Arbarello, M. Cornalba, P.A. Griffiths, and J.
