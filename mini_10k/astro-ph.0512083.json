Gamma-ray bursts: cannon balls\n\n1. Introduction\nIt has been argued in the literature that, as an alternative to the fireball scenario (e.g. Piran 1999, and references\ntherein), the so-called cannonball (CB) model provides a\ngood fit to the observed GRB flux and temporal variations\n(Dar & De R\u00fajula 2004). For example, to explain GRBs, CBs\nmust be created in supernova explosions and accelerated to\nhigh Lorentz factors, \u0393CB \u223c 1000. However, the origin of\nthese highly relativistic \"balls\" of matter has not yet been investigated and is the subject of much debate and controversy. In\norder to shed some light on the still open questions of their formation and early evolution we investigate, in this paper, the CB\nphysical conditions at the origin given their features at the distance when they become transparent to their enclosed radiation\nas required to explain GRBs. Our proposal is that the conditions\nwithin the CB as we scale the distance down along its path to\nthe origin should be an indication of their formation site. This,\ndespite the simplicity of our approach, we hope might help elucidate some questions related to the origin/existence of these\nCBs. We start in Sect. 2 by a brief introduction to the CB model\nas described in Dar & De R\u00fajula (2004). In particular CBs conditions at infinity which best fits GRB lightcurves are isolated.\nIn Sect. 3 we present the methods we adopted to extrapolate\nback to the CB source. In Sect. 4, given the conditions at the\norigin, we study possible formation sites and explore formation\nmechanisms. Sect. 5 is devoted to the study of mechanisms ca-\n\npable of acceleration CBs to Lorentz factors as high as \u223c 1000.\nWe summarize our results and conclude in Sect. 6.\n\n2. The CB model for GRBs\nIn the CB model for GRBs, the prompt gamma ray emission\nis assumed to be produced when ambient light from the supernova1 is Compton up scattered by the electrons in the CB.\nThese CBs move with \u0393CB \u223c 1000 with respect to the supernova remnant and as such the emitted radiation is highly\nbeamed in the observer frame (Dar & De R\u00fajula 2004). For\nthe first 103 s in the CB rest frame, the CB in a fast cooling\nphase emits via thermal bremsstrahlung (Dado et al. 2002),\nbut eventually, it is argued, its emissivity is dominated by synchrotron emission from ISM electrons that penetrate it. A CB\nwill become transparent to the bulk of its enclosed radiation in\na time of O(1) s in observer frame after it exits the transparent\noutskirts of the shell of the associated SN. The internal radiation pressure drops abruptly and its transverse expansion rate\nis quenched by collisionless, magnetic-field mediated interactions with the ISM (Dado et al. 2002).\nTypical values for CB parameters as derived by Dado et al.\n(2002) and Dar & De R\u00fajula (2004) are given in Table 1 where\nwe denote the radius of the CB by RCB , the distance travelled\nby the CB from its origin by D, the time passed in the CB\nrest frame by t. The expansion velocity of the CB is denoted\n1\n\nSend offprint requests to: jstaff@capca.ucalgary.ca\n\nThe wind from the SN progenitor star is ionized and is semitransparent to photons in the visible and UV frequencies.\n\n\f2\n\nStaff, Fendt, Ouyed: Cannonballs formation sites\n\nTable 1.

The subscript \"trans\" refers\nto the point where the CB becomes transparent (\"transparency\nradius\").\nBy fitting the observed GRB afterglow the CB Lorentz factor is estimated to vary between \u0393CB = 250 and \u0393CB = 1600,\nwhile the number of baryons is of the order of 1050 . With this\ninformation at hand, our goal is to derive the conditions in the\nCB as we integrate back to a plausible source. As an indication\nof the close proximity to a compact source (e.g. black-holes and\nneutron stars) when applicable we will make use of the notion\nof light cylinder which we take to be about RL \u223c 107 cm.\n\n3. Cannonball propagation and evolution\nIn this section, we will explore the evolution of the CB by extrapolating backward from the location where the GRB occurs\nto where the CB reaches nuclear saturation density (applying\nCB parameters as given in Table 1). For simplicity, we assume\nthat the CB is expanding with a constant velocity and is moving\nwith a constant Lorentz factor. The natural assumption for the\nexpansion velocity\n\u221a is the sound speed of the hot blob of matter,\nvexp \u2243 cs \u2243 c/ 3. Six different cases of CB Lorentz factor\nand mass are investigated (see Table 2).\nWe will first apply a simple model of the CB's internal energy obeying a simple equation of state. Using this we calculate\nthe evolution of the density, magnetic field and temperature as\nthe CB moves away from the origin. In a second step we extend\nour model approach applying an energy equation where pressure degeneracy and neutrino effects are included. As we will\nsee, spatial back integration from the transparency radius will\ngive strong indication that the CB may be launched close to a\nblack hole. The spatial integration back to the source is carried\nout until the CB temperature reaches extreme values, Tl \u223c 100\nMeV, unless the CB density reaches nuclear saturation density\nbefore Tl .\nWith the CB expanding at a constant expansion\nvelocity\n\u221a\nequal to the sound speed of the matter vexp = c/ 3, we can use\ncertain estimates about the CB at the distance of transparency\nto derive an interrelation between radius and distance from origin the CB has traveled.

Depending on the CB parameters, the densities at\nthe light cylinder range from 1010 \u2212 1014 g/cm3 .\nIf we estimate the CB magnetic field\n\u221a strength from the\nequipartition assumption, vA \u2243 vs = c/ 3, with the Alfv\u00e9n\nspeed vA and\ns\np\nMCB\n(5)\nB = vA 4\u03c0\u03c1 = c\n3 .\nRCB\nwe may compute the CB magnetic field versus the distance\nfrom origin (Fig. 2). Close to the hypothetical CB origin where\nwe reach nuclear saturation density, the magnetic field strength\napproaches values up to B \u223c 1018 G (see also \u00a74.1). At a distance from the origin of the order of the light cylinder radius,\nthe field strength is between 4.8 \u00d7 1015 and 1.4 \u00d7 1018 Gauss\ndepending on the choice of Lorentz factor and mass of the CB.\nThe densities ranges from 109 to 1014 g/cm3 .\n\n(11)\n\nThis equation is solved to find T as a function of D.\nIn what follows, we explore two scenarios: (i) the first one\nis indicative of the close proximity of a compact source and as\nsuch it corresponds to the case where the energy equation is\nintegrated assuming equipartition at nuclear saturation densities; (ii) the second reflect scenarios where the CB originates\nfrom the coronal region of compact stars of of their associated\naccretion disks. Specifics below.\n\n3.1.1. Equipartition at nuclear densities: source\norigin\nTo set equipartition at nuclear saturation density, \u01ebm has to be\n0.5 for all cases. By rearranging Eq. (11) it can be seen that it\nbecomes a function of T and \u03c1:\naT 4 + 3\u03c1kT /mH = 2\u03c1c2 \u01ebm\n\n(12)\n\nThe temperature therefore depends on the density only and implies a temperature of about 1012 K at nuclear saturation density for all cases. The temperature as a function of distance travelled is shown in Fig. 3 while Fig. 4 shows the energy components for case 4. The radiation energy is dominant everywhere\nexcept at nuclear saturation density where there is equipartition. We note that nuclear saturation density would be reach at\ndistances larger than 106 cm for most cases. It is unrealistic to\n\n\f4\n\nStaff, Fendt, Ouyed: Cannonballs formation sites\n\nfind object with such high densities much larger than 106 cm.\nAlso, CBs with such densities need a magnetic field B = 1018\nG, which is unrealisticly high. We can therefore rule out CBs\nformed with nuclear saturation density.\nIt should be noted that the solutions are not very sensitive to\nthe choice of total internal energy2. As an example, increasing\nthe total internal energy by an order of magnitude we find a\ntemperature at the light cylinder, Dlc , for case 3 to be 9 \u00d7 1011\nK, compared to 5 \u00d7 1011 K in our initial calculation.\n\n10\n\nFigure 5 show the evolution of the CB conditions when\nequipartition at a distance of about a light cylinder radius is assumed, and in Fig. 6 the energy components for case 4. Table 4\nshows the temperature found at the light cylinder and the value\nfor the energy equipartition parameter \u01ebm for different kinematic parameters of the CB (see Table1). Note that \u01ebm is now\ndetermined by the condition that we have equipartition at the\nCB origin (i.e. at a light cylinder distance).\n\n14\n\nTable 4. Coronal CB origin.

If we take\nthe light cylinder distance as a typical length unit at the CB\norigin and compute the Fermi temperature at this location, we\nsee that the CB temperature is much smaller than the electron\nFermi temperature (Table 5). We therefore have to improve our\napproach considering also electron degeneracy and neutrino effects. In the next section we will explore a more appropriate energy equation where neutrino effects are added. However, we\nwill still apply a kinematic approach assuming a linear expansion of the CB.\n\n\fE [erg]\n\nStaff, Fendt, Ouyed: Cannonballs formation sites\n10\n\n47\n\n10\n\n46\n\n10\n\n45\n\n10\n\n44\n\n10\n\n43\n\n10\n\n42\n\n10\n\n41\n\n10\n\n40\n\n10\n\n39\n\ngives Xnuc < 1, and Xnuc = 1 elsewhere.

Coronal CB origin: neutrino effects\nIn this section we improve our approach by taking into account\ndegeneracy pressure and neutrino cooling (e.g. Popham et al.\n1999). The energy equation becomes,\nEtot + E\u03bd (t) = Eth + Erad + Edeg + Emag\nwhere\nEdeg = 3KMCB\nis the degeneracy energy,\nErad =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1\n\u03bce\n\n\u00131/3\n\n,\n\n11 aT 4\nMCB ,\n4 \u03c1\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nis the radiation energy and\n1 + 3Xnuc\n3\nRT MCB\n,\n2\n4\nthe gas thermal energy where\n\u00139/8\n\u0013\u22123/4 \u0012\n\u0012\nT\n\u03c1\nXnuc = 30.97\n1010 g/cm3\n1010 K\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1010 K\n\u00d7 exp \u2212 6.096 \u00d7\nT\nEth =\n\n5\n\n(16)\n\nNote that we apply the same total internal energy (Etot )\nof the CB as in Sec. 3.3, thus the same energy parameter \u01ebm .\nClose to the origin, however, we add an energy component due\nto neutrino effects (emissivity and cooling) and is denoted by\nE\u03bd (t) in Eq. 13.\nTwo types of neutrino losses may occur, i.e. neutrino emission due to pair annihilation and neutrino losses due to the capture of pairs on nuclei. Their contribution to the energy budget\nis computed from Eq. 3.8 and Eq. 3.9 in Popham et al. (1999):\n\u00139\n\u0012\nT\n33\nq\u0307\u03bd\u03bd = 5.0 \u00d7 10\nergs cm\u22123 s\u22121\n(19)\n1011 K\nq\u0307eN = 9.0 \u00d7 1033\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1\n1010 g/cm3\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nT\n1011 K\n\n\u00136\n\nergs cm\u22123 s\u22121\n\n(20)\nThese expressions are integrated over the time it takes the CB to\nreach conditions for which neutrino cooling is not significant.\nWe find the latter cooling method (Eq. 20) to be dominant, so\nwe limit ourself to using that.\nTo compute the effects due to neutrinos, we must know the\ntemperature. However, in turn, we want to use the neutrino effects to find the temperature. We therefore first solve the energy\nequation 13 without adding neutrino effects. Then we use the\ntemperature found to calculate the neutrino emissivity which is\nthen added to the total energy in equation 13, and this equation is solved to find the temperature as a function of distance\ntravelled. The neutrinos are released in small successive bursts,\nmimicking a continuous emission.\nWe emphasize again that because of the neutrinos effects\nand the different energy equation used in sec 3.3 there is no\nassumption on energy equipartition applied in this section.\nThe temperature is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of distance\ntravelled. In general, the release of neutrinos are seen as a small\njump in the temperature curve. We note that cases 1 to 4 reach\nthe light cylinder with reasonable temperatures (T < 1012 K)\nand densities (\u03c1 < 1014 g/cm3 ). Cases 5 and 7 are ruled out as\nthey reach even more extreme conditions before reaching the\nlight cylinder. For illustrative purposes in Fig. 8 we show the\nenergy components for case 3. Because of the neutrino effects,\nthe radiation energy is now the dominant energy, even close to\nthe light cylinder.\n\n4. Sites and formation mechanisms\n(17)\n\nIn this section we discuss sites that are best suited to account\nfor the CBs conditions at the source derived in our previous\nsection. We also explore possible formation scenarios.\n\n\f6\n\nStaff, Fendt, Ouyed: Cannonballs formation sites\n14\n\n10\n\n12\n\nCa\n\n10\n\n7\nse\n4 3\nse se\nCa Ca\nCa\n\nse\n\n12\n\nK\n\n10\n\n11\n\nK\n\n1\n\n10\n\nT [K]\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n4\n\nDlc\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\nD [cm]\n\n12\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n16\n\n10\n\n18\n\nFig. 7.

Exceptions exist for strong accretion\nrates and in the outer part of the disk (see also Narayan et al.\n2001). However as can be seen for Eq. (A.8)-(A.11) in the appendix these extreme cases favor lower densities and temperatures than those expected for CBs.\nThe magneto-rotational instability (MRI, Balbus & Hawley\n1991 and Hawley & Balbus 1991) works only for low magnetic field strengths and cannot account for the strong magnetic\nfields required at the origin for CBs. Let us also mention the\naccretion-ejection instability (Tagger et al. 1992) as a possible\nformation mechanism. This instability works for intermediate\nmagnetic field strengths and will transfer angular momentum to\nAlfv\u00e9n waves toward the corona of the disk. At extreme magnetization the accretion-ejection instability is reminiscent of the\ninterchange instability (Spruit et al. 1995) but it seems unlikely\nthat these can lead to CBs formation since most of the perturbations are carried by Alfv\u00e9n waves.\nIt is thus not clear how a CB can form within a hyperaccretion disk. There is also the issue of accelerating the CB to\n\u0393 > 100 which is also a major challenge. We will return to this\nin \u00a75 after we discuss other possible formation sites.\n\n108\n\n109\n\n1010\n\n1011\n\n1012\nD [cm]\n\n1013\n\n1014\n\n1015\n\n1016\n\nFig. 8.

The neutrino release is visible in the radiation\nenergy and gas thermal energy at D = 3 \u00d7 107 cm. Another\nnot visible release occurs at D = 3 \u00d7 108 cm.\n\n4.1. \"Standard\" and hyperaccreting disks\nIn appendix A we summarize properties of \"standard\" (\u03b1-disks\nand advection dominated accretion flow disks) and hyperaccretion disks. It is clear that \"standard\" accretion disks are ruled\nout. Hyperaccreting disks on the other hand are candidates as\nCB sources. They have densities, temperatures and magnetic\nfield that are comparable to what we found in the previous section. In fact when we consider CBs with hyperaccretion disk\nconditions at the source and perform a forward integration, the\nconditions at Dtrans (see Figures B.1-B.3 in appendix B) turn\nout to be interestingly similar to those given by Dado et al.\n(2002). The next step then is to look for formation mechanisms\nwithin the hyperaccreting context.\nThe stability of hyperaccreting disks around black holes\nhave been recently investigated by Di Matteo et al. (2002) who\n\nThe thick, self-gravitating, neutron tori around 2-3 M\u2299 black\nholes are known to be affected by a runaway instability on time\nscales below the evolutionary time scale of GRBs (Nishida &\nEriguchi 1996) and we therefore exclude them as source for\nCBs. Simulations of neutron star mergers have also shown that\nabout 0.01 M\u2299 of the thick disk of 0.2 M\u2299 around a 1.5 to 3.1\nM\u2299 final central mass distribution becomes gravitationally unbound (Rosswog et al. 1999). However, in difference to the hyperaccreting disk model, this unbound mass stays rather cold\n(108 K) and do not constitute a formation site for CBs.\n\n4.3. Accretion disk corona\nAnother possibility is CB formation in the disk corona, for example as a huge magnetic flare which ejects a large part of the\naccretion disk corona into a bullet of high velocity. A CB of\nsuch a size would have a density of about 2.4 \u00d7 105 g cm\u22123\nwhich is, for comparison, in the range of white dwarf densities. The maximum initial size of the CB we expect not to\nexceed RLC \u2243 107 cm. Comparing the CB asymptotic kinetic energy to the magnetic energy contained in a volume\nof that size, provides an estimate for the mean magnetic field\nstrength of about 1015 G. This corresponds to a magnetic flux\nof \u223c 1029 \u2212 1030 G cm2 and is unrealistically high for such\ncoronae.\n\n4.4. Disk-jets and funnel-jets\nFigure 9 is an illustration of the type of jets that could emanate from the vicinity of a compact star. The disk-jet material\nis ejected from the accretion disk while the funnel-jet is ejected\n\n\fStaff, Fendt, Ouyed: Cannonballs formation sites\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\nFunnel\u2212jet\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nDisk\u2212jet\n\n(Michel 1969)\n\u03c3=\n\nCompact star\n\nFig. 9. Illustration of Funnel-jet and Disk-jet. The funnel-jet is\nlaunched from a region close to the compact star. The disk-jet\nis launched from the accretion disk.\nfrom the innermost parts of the disk at the interface with the\ncompact star.\nRecent general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations by De Villiers et al. (2005) of a black hole and an initial torus seeded with a weak poloidal magnetic field show that\na funnel jet with \u0393CB & 50 is formed. Instabilities do occur\nin funnel-jets, however, the induced instabilities have densities\nmuch lower than the CB values found in the previous section.\nFunnel-jets can therefore be ruled out as a possible formation\nsite for CBs.\nA disk-jet becomes cylindrically collimated on a length\nscale of the order of 1-2 light cylinder distances (Fendt &\nMemola 2001). Knot generating instabilities reminiscent of\nCBs are known to occur as jets collimate (Ouyed et al. 1997).\nThis is a possible formation mechanism for CBs. What remains\nis to show how they can be accelerated to high \u0393. Specifics below.\n\n5. CB acceleration to ultra-relativistic velocity\nHaving isolated, or more precisely favored, jets from hyperaccretion disks as plausible formation sites for CBs we now\ndiscuss acceleration mechanisms with which CBs can reach\nLorentz factors in the thousands.\nAssuming that the CB is accelerated by converting the internal magnetic energy to kinetic energy, we can find an estimate for the magnetic field needed to explain such Lorentz\nfactors. Using typical CB radii close to the source and parameters from Table 1 we find that the magnetic field must be of the\norder of 1018 \u2212 1019 G. This is unrealistically high.

MHD instability: CB mass\nTo a first order, instabilities related to Alfv\u00e9n crossing time can\ndevelop on timescales\ntins = tA =\n\n2Rjet\n,\nvA\n\n(24)\n\nwhere Rjet is the radius of the disk-jet. For 1Rlc < Rjet <\n10Rlc , we arrive at tins \u223c 1 \u2212 10 ms which would imply the\nplausible formation of blob of matter as massive as Mins =\ntins \u1e40jet \u223c 10\u22128 \u2212 10\u22127 M\u2299 . This can be compared to the\ntypical CB mass of the order MCB = 10\u22127 M\u2299 .\nAs we have shown above, first forming the CB in the disk\nand then accelerating it will require unrealistic magnetic fields\nof the order 1019 G. However, first accelerating the wind to the\nlight cylinder and then forming the CB through an instability\nbeyond the light cylinder requires much smaller magnetic field\nstrength (< 1014 G). This is a possible mechanism for forming\nand accelerating CBs.\n\n6. Conclusion\nAssuming that CBs move and expand with a constant velocity we have estimated the CB conditions as close as possible to their origin. CBs require extremely high internal magnetic fields when they are formed with field strength exceeding \u223c 1015 G. The temperature was found to be of the order\nof 1011 \u2212 1012 K. The physical parameters of the CBs at the\norigin are, within an order of magnitude estimates, indicative\nof hyperaccreting disks. However, if formed in the accretion\ndisk we find it challenging to accelerate the CBs to the high\nLorentz factors. The coronal origin is ruled out because of the\nunrealistically high coronal magnetic flux necessary to form the\nCBs. Our results instead hint to a jet origin of CBs. The radius\n(< Dlc ) and mass flow ( 10\u22125 M\u2299 /s) in a jet from a hyperaccreting can account for the CB mass and density. Furthermore,\n\n\f8\n\nStaff, Fendt, Ouyed: Cannonballs formation sites\n\nthis outflow can be accelerated to \u0393 \u223c 2000 by MHD processes (Fendt & Ouyed 2004). Any instability in this outflow\nbeyond the light cylinder could lead to CB formation. We thus\nsuggest that CBs form as instabilities in ultra-relativistic jets\nemanating from the surface of hyperaccretion disks. The tight\nlink between SNe and the CB model for GRB requires that all\n(or almost all) core collapse SNe will produce CBs. Our work,\nwithin its limitations, implies that hyperaccretion disks must be\na common occurrence in core collapse SNe to accommodate\nthe CB model - a notion which remains to be confirmed.\nAcknowledgements.
