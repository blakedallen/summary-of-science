Here, we present such a calculation and discuss its prediction on the transverse\nmass distribution of the W boson and the transverse momentum distribution of its decay charged lepton,\nwhich are the most relevant observables for measuring the W boson mass at hadron colliders.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nElectronic address: cao@pa.msu.edu\nElectronic address: yuan@pa.msu.edu\n\n\fAs a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM), the mass of the W -boson (MW )\nis of particular importance. Aside from being an important test of the SM itself, a precision\nmeasurement of MW , together with an improved measurement of top quark mass (Mt ), provides\nsevere indirect bounds on the mass of Higgs boson (MH ). With a precision of 27 MeV for MW\nand 2.7 GeV for Mt , which are the target values for Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron collider, MH\nin the SM can be predicted with an uncertainty of about 35% [1]. Comparison of these indirect\nconstraints on MH with the results from direct Higgs boson searches, at the LEP2, the Tevatron\nand the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), will be an important test of the SM. In order to\nhave a precision measurement of MW , the theoretical uncertainties, dominantly coming from the\ntransverse momentum of the W -boson (PTW ), the uncertainty in parton distribution function (PDF)\nand the electroweak (EW) radiative corrections to the W boson decay, must be controlled to a\nbetter accuracy [3].\nAt the Tevatron, about ninety percent of the production cross section of W boson is in the small\ntransverse momentum region, where PTW \u2264 20 GeV. When PTW is much smaller than MW , every\n\nsoft-gluon emission will induce a large logarithmic contribution to the PTW distribution so that the\norder-by-order perturbative calculation in the theory of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) cannot accurately describe the PTW spectrum and the contribution from multiple soft-gluon emission,\nwhich contributes to all orders in the expansion of the strong coupling constant \u03b1s , needs to be\nsummed to all orders. It has been shown that by applying the renormalization group analysis, the\nmultiple soft-gluon radiation effects can be resummed to all orders to predict the PTW distribution\nthat agrees with experimental data [4, 5]. RESBOS, a Monte Carlo (MC) program [5] resumming the initial-state soft-gluon radiations of the hadronically produced lepton pairs through EW\nvector boson production and decay at hadron colliders pp\u0304/pp \u2192 V (\u2192 l1 l \u03042 )X, has been used\nby the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations at the Tevatron to compare with their data in order to determine MW . However, RESBOS does not include any higher order EW corrections to describe\nthe vector boson decay. The EW radiative correction, in particular the final-state QED correction,\nis crucial for precision measurement of W boson mass at the Tevatron, because photon emission\nfrom the final-state charged lepton can significantly modify the lepton momentum which is used\nin the determination of MW . In the CDF Run Ib W mass measurement, the mass shifts due to\nradiative effects were estimated to be \u221265 \u00b1 20 MeV and \u2212168 \u00b1 10 MeV for the electron and\nmuon channels, respectively [2]. The full next-to-leading order (NLO) O(\u03b1) EW corrections have\nbeen calculated [8, 9] and resulted in WGRAD [9], a MC program for calculating O(\u03b1) EW ra-\n\n\fdiative corrections to the process pp\u0304 \u2192 \u03bdl l(\u03b3). However, WGRAD does not include the dominant\ncorrection originated from the initial-state multiple soft-gluon emission. To incorporate both the\ninitial-state QCD and and final-state QED corrections into a parton level MC program is urgently\nrequired to reduce the theoretical uncertainties in interpreting the experimental data at the Tevatron. It was shown in Refs. [8, 9] that at the NLO, the EW radiative correction in pp\u0304 \u2192 l\u03bdl (\u03b3)\nis dominated by the final-state QED (FQED) correction. Hence, in this paper we present a consistent calculation which includes both the initial-state multiple soft-gluon QCD resummation and\nthe final-state NLO QED corrections, and develop an upgraded version of the RESBOS program,\ncalled RESBOS-A [10], to simulate the signal events.\nThe fully differential cross section for the production and decay of the W boson that includes\nonly the effect of the initial-state multiple QCD soft-gluon emission can be found in Ref. [5].\nTo include also the final-state NLO QED contributions, we sum up the following two sets of\ndifferential cross sections. One, cf. Eq. (1), contains final-state QED virtual correction and part\nof the real photon emission contribution in which photon is either soft or collinear. Another, cf.\nEq. (2), includes the hard photon contribution from the real photon emission processes. Denote Q,\ny, QT and \u03c6W to be the invariant mass, rapidity, transverse momentum and azimuthal angle of the\ndi-lepton pair, respectively.

[5]. In our calculation, we have included A(1) , A(2) , B (1) , B (2) ,\nC (0) and C (1) , with canonical choice of Ci 's. The Y piece in Eq. (1), which is the difference of the\nfixed order perturbative result and their singular part, can be found in Appendix E of Ref. [5].\nWe follow the prescription in Ref. [7], which decomposes the electroweak O(\u03b1) contribution\nto the resonant single W production in a general 4-fermion process into gauge invariant QED-like\n\n\fand weak parts, to extract a gauge invariant QED-like form factor from the photon contribution.\nThe NLO FQED differential cross sections are calculated by using phase space slicing method [6],\nwhich introduces two theoretical cutoff parameters, soft cutoff \u03b4S and collinear cutoff \u03b4C , to isolate the soft and collinear singularities associated with the real photon emission subprocesses by\npartitioning phase space into soft, collinear and hard regions such that\n|Mr |2 = |Mr |2soft + |Mr |2collinear + |Mr |2hard .\n\n(7)\n\nThe soft region is thus defined by requiring that the photon energy (E\u03b3 ) in the (j k\u0304) parton center\u221a\n\u221a\nof-mass frame to satisfy E\u03b3 < \u03b4S \u015d/2, where \u015d is the invariant mass of the (j k\u0304) partons. Using\nthe dimensional regularization scheme, we can then evaluate, in n-dimensions, the real photon\nemission diagrams under the soft photon approximation, where the photon momentum is set to be\nzero in the numerator, and integrate over the soft region. In the soft and collinear regions the cross\nsection is proportional to the Born cross section. The soft singularities originating from the finalstate photon radiation cancel against the corresponding singularities from the final-state virtual\n\u221a\ncorrections and leave a finite result depending on the soft cutoff parameter \u03b4S . For E\u03b3 > \u03b4S \u015d/2,\nthe real photon emission diagrams are calculated in four dimensions using the helicity amplitude\nmethod. The collinear singularities associated with photon radiation from the final-state charged\nlepton is regulated by the finite lepton mass. The end result of the calculation consists of two sets\nof weighted events corresponding to the j k\u0304 \u2192 \u03bdl l+ (\u03b3) and j k\u0304 \u2192 \u03bdl l+ \u03b3 contributions which are\nincluded in Eqs. (1) and (2), separately. Each set depends on the soft cutoff parameter \u03b4S . The sum\nof the two contributions, however, is independent of \u03b4S , as long as the soft cutoff is small enough\nto validate the soft-gluon approximation. In our numerical studies, we take \u03b4S = 0.001 which\nyields a stable numerical result in agreement with Refs. [8, 9]. Through our calculation, we adopt\nthe CERN LEP line-shape prescription of a resonance state and write the W boson propagator as\n(p2\n\n\u2212\n\n2\nMW\n)\n\n1\n,\n2\n+ iMW \u0393W p2 /MW\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u0393W is the width of W boson.\nTo examine how much the combined contributions from the initial-state QCD resummation and\nthe final-state QED corrections can affect the precision measurement of MW , we perform Monte\nCarlo analyses to study a few experimental observables that are most sensitive to the measurement\n\u221a\nof MW at the Tevatron (a pp\u0304 collider with S=1.96 TeV). For the numerical evaluation we chose\nthe following set of SM parameters: \u03b1 = 1/137.0359895, G\u03bc = 1.16637 \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 , MW =\n\n\fd\u03c3\n\n40\n\n\u03b4\n\n+\n\ndm\u03bde\nT\n\nRES + NLO QED\nRES + LO QED\nLO + NLO QED\nLO + LO QED\n\n[ pb/GeV ]\n\n1.3\n1.2\n\n30\n\n1.1\n1\n\n20\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\nRES + NLO QED\nLO + LO QED\nLO + NLO QED\nLO + LO QED\n\n10\n0.7\n0.6\n0\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n80\n+\nmT\u03bde (GeV)\n\n90\n\n100\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n80\n+\n\u03bde\nmT (GeV)\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1: Transverse mass distribution of W + boson\n\n80.35 GeV, \u0393W = 2.0887 GeV, MZ = 91.1867 GeV, me = 0.51099907 MeV. Thus, the square of\n\u221a\n2\nthe weak gauge coupling is g 2 = 4 2MW\nG\u03bc . Because of the limited space, we focus our attention\non the positively charged electron lepton (i.e. positron) only, though our analysis procedure also\napplies to the \u03bc lepton. The complete study including both electron and muon leptons will be\nshown in our forthcoming paper, in which we also extend our study to the LHC.\nThe W events in these analyses are selected by demanding a single isolated high pT charged\nlepton in conjunction with large missing transverse energy. To model the acceptance cuts used by\nthe CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations in their W mass analyses, we impose the following transverse\nmomentum (pT ) and pseudo-rapidity (\u03b7) cuts on the final-state leptons:\npeT > 25GeV, |\u03b7(e)| < 1.2, 6 ET > 25GeV.\n\n(9)\n\nDue to the overwhelming QCD backgrounds, the measurement of W boson mass at hadron\ncollider is performed in the leptonic decay channels. Since the longitudinal momentum of the\nneutrinos produced in the leptonic W boson decays (W + \u2192 \u03bde e+ ) cannot be measured, there is\ninsufficient information to reconstruct the invariant mass of the W boson. Instead, the transverse\nmass distribution of the final state lepton pair, which exhibits a Jacobian edge at MT \u223c MW , is\n\n\fused to extract out MW . Transverse mass (MTW ) of W is defined as\nq\nW\nMT = 2peT p\u03bdT (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle between the charged lepton and the neutrino in the transverse plane. The\nneutrino transverse momentum (p\u03bdT ) is identified with the missing transverse energy (6 ET ) in the\nevent. In Fig. 1, we show various theory predictions on the MTW distribution. The legend of the\nfigure is defined as follows:\n\u2022 LO : including only the Born level initial-state contribution,\n\u2022 RES : including the initial-state multiple soft-gluon corrections via QCD resummation,\n\u2022 LO QED : including only the Born level final-state contribution,\n\u2022 NLO QED : including the final-state NLO QED corrections.\nFor example, the solid curve (labelled as RES+NLO QED) in Fig. 1(a) is the prediction from our\ncombined calculation given by Eqs. (1) and (2).\nAs shown in Fig. 1(a), compared to the lowest order cross section (dotted curve), the initial\nstate QCD resummation effects (dashed curve) increase the cross section at the peak of the MTW\ndistribution by about 20%, and the final state NLO QED corrections (dot-dashed curve) decrease\nit by about \u221212%, while the combined contributions (solid curve) of the QCD resummation and\nFQED corrections increase it by 7%. In addition to the change in magnitude, the line-shape of\nthe MTW distribution is significantly modified by the effects of QCD resummation and FQED\ncorrections. To illustrate this point, we plot the ratio of the (RES+NLO QED) differential cross\nsections to the LO ones as the solid curve in Fig. 1(b). The dashed curve is for the ratio of\n(LO+NLO QED) to LO. As shown in the figure, the QCD resummation effect dominates the\nshape of MTW distribution for 65 GeV \u2264 MW \u2264 95 GeV, while the FQED correction reaches its\n\nmaximal effect around the Jacobian peak (MTW \u2243 MW ). Hence, both corrections must be included\nto accurately predict the distribution of MTW around the Jacobian region to determine MW . We\n\nnote that after including the effect due to the finite resolution of the detector (for identifying an\nisolated electron or muon), the size of the FQED correction is largely reduced [8, 9].\nAlthough the MTW distribution has been the optimal observable for determining MW at the\nTevatron, it requires an accurate measurement of the missing transverse momentum direction\nwhich is in practice difficult to control.

Another important feature of this observable is that peT\ndistribution is more sensitive to the transverse momentum of W boson. Hence, the QCD softgluon resummation effects, the major source of pW\nT , must be included to reduce the theoretical\nuncertainty of this method. In Fig. 2(a), we show the peT distributions predicted by various theory\ncalculations, and in Fig. 2(b), the ratios of the higher order to lowest order cross sections as a\nfunction of peT . The lowest order distribution (dotted curve) shows a clear and sharp Jacobian peak\nat peT \u2243 MW /2, and the distribution with the NLO final-state QED correction (dot-dashed curve)\nalso exhibits the similar Jacobian peak with the peak magnitude reduced by about 15%. But the\nclear and sharp Jacobian peak of the lowest order and NLO FQED distributions (in which pW\nT = 0)\nare strongly smeared by the finite transverse momentum of the W boson induced by multiple softgluon radiation, as clearly demonstrated by the QCD resummation distribution (dashed curve) and\nthe combined contributions of the QCD resummation and FQED corrections (solid curve). Similar to the MTW distribution, the QCD resummation effect dominates the whole peT range, while\n\n\f\u03b4 1.1\n\u03b41=\n\n\u03b42\n\nLO + NLO QED\nLO + LO QED\n\n\u03b41\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n\u03b4 2=\n\n0.8\n25\n\u03b4\n\nRES+NLO QED\nRES+LO QED\n\n30\n\n35\n\n+\n\npTe (GeV)\n\n40\n\n1.1\n\u03b4 1=\n\n45\n\n50\n\n90\n\n100\n\n\u03b42\n\nLO + NLO QED\nLO + LO QED\n\n\u03b41\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\u03b42=\n\n0.8\n50\n\nRES+NLO QED\nRES+LO QED\n\n70\n\n60\n\n+\n\nmT\u03bde (GeV)\n\n80\n\nFIG. 3: Distributions of R, \u03b41 and \u03b42\n\nthe FQED correction reaches it maximum around the Jacobian peak (half of MW ). The combined\ncontribution of the QCD resummation and FQED corrections reaches the order of 45% near the\nJacobian peak. Hence, these lead us to conclude that the QCD resummation effects are crucial in\nthe measurement of MW from fitting the Jacobian kinematical edge of the peT distribution.\nIt is also interesting to examine the effect of the final-state NLO QED correction to the theory predictions with LO (leading order) or RES (resummed) initial-state cross sections, which is\ndescribed by the observable R, defined as\nR=\n\n\u03b42\n,\n\u03b41\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\nLO + NLO QED\n,\nLO + LO QED\nRES + NLO QED\n\u03b42 =\n.\nRES + LO QED\n\u03b41 =\n\n(12)\n\nThe distributions of R as a function of peT and MTW are shown in the upper part and lower part of\n\n\fFig. 3, respectively. As expected, the R(MT ) distribution is almost flat all the way from 60 GeV\n\nto 100 GeV, but the R(peT ) distribution deviates from one in the Jacobian peak region. This is due\n\nto the fact that peT is more sensitive to PTW than MTW .\n\nIn order to study the impact of the presented calculation to the determination of the W boson\nmass, the effect due to the finite resolution of the detector should be included, which will be\npresented elsewhere.\nWe thank P.
