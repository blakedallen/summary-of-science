Thanks to the high luminosity,\nSNe can be detected in distant galaxies. By measuring the\ncosmic occurrence rate of core-collapse SNe, one can study\nthe overall formation rate of the massive star population\nthrough cosmic time. With upcoming or planned large-scale\noptical and near-infrared (NIR) surveys, SNe could be detected to z \u223c 2 or higher. It is thus important to derive a\nrealistic estimate for the detectability in order to make an\nefficient survey strategy for such observational programmes.\nLien & Fields\n(2009)\nstudy\nthe\ndetectability of core-collapse SNe with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n(LSST,\nIvezic et al.\n2008;\nLSST Science Collaborations et al. 2009). They show\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: masaomi.tanaka@nao.ac.jp\n\nc - RAS\n\nthat the wide survey with LSST (with the 5 \u03c3 r-band\nlimiting magnitude of 25 mag) can detect Type II SNe,\ncore-collapse SNe with hydrogen features, up to z \u223c 2.\nMagnification by gravitational lensing will boost the\nnumber of detectable SNe (Oguri & Marshall 2010).\nType II SNe at higher redshifts can be detected by\nan extremely deep NIR survey (Miralda-Escude & Rees\n1997; Mesinger, Johnson & Haiman 2006) with future satellites such as James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\nMesinger, Johnson & Haiman (2006) show that up to several thousands Type II SNe can be detected at z \u223c 6 if\nthe survey depth reaches the flux limit of 3 nJy (30 mag in\nAB magnitude), which can be achievable with long (\u223c 105\nseconds) integration with JWST.\nIt may be more promising to aim at detecting SNe that\nare bright in the rest frame optical to ultra-violet (UV) wavelengths. Type IIn SNe, a type of SNe with narrow hydrogen\nemission lines, are ideal targets to detect at high-redshifts\n\n\f2\n\nTanaka et al.\n\n(Cooke 2008). Type IIn SNe are thought to be powered\nby the interaction of the SN ejecta with the circumstellar\nmedium (Schlegel 1990), and are bright in the rest frame\noptical to UV. Cooke et al. (2009) reported the discovery of\nType IIn SNe at z = 2.4 and 2.0 in the archival data of the\nlegacy survey with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.\nThere is another type of possibly luminous SNe\nworth mentioning here. Pair-instability SNe (PISNe) are\nthought to be triggered by very massive stars with\nmass in the range of 140-260 M\u2299 at zero metallicity\n(Heger & Woosley 2002), and are also expected to be very\nluminous (Scannapieco et al. 2005). PISNe might also occur even in the local Universe, as suggested by the recent\ndiscovery of SN 2007bi (Gal-Yam et al. 2009; Young et al.\n2010). However, PISNe are not very luminous at rest\nUV wavelengths (Kasen, Woosley & Heger 2011), and thus\nthey can be detected only at z < 2 even with LSST\n(Pan, Loeb & Kasen 2011). It is possible, in principle, to\ndetect PISNe at z > 6 with an extremely deep NIR survey\nwith K =28.7 mag (Scannapieco et al. 2005, see also recent\npapers by Pan, Kasen & Loeb 2011; Hummel et al. 2011),\nbut the occurence rate of PISNe (or the formation rate of\nextremely massive stars) at such high redshifts is highly\nuncertain. Interestingly, recent theoretical studies and detailed simulations of the first generation of stars suggest\nthat the characteristic mass of the first stars is not as large\nas the progenitor of a PISN (Yoshida, Omukai & Hernquist\n2007; Hosokawa et al. 2011). Then observing core-collapse\nSNe may be a more promising route to study the massive\nstar population in the early Universe.\nRecently, superluminous SNe were discovered such\nas SN 2006gy (Ofek et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2007, 2008;\nAgnoletto et al. 2009; Kawabata et al. 2009) and SN\n2005ap (Quimby et al. 2007), whereas other superluminous SNe include SNe 2003ma (Rest et al. 2011),\n2006oz (Leloudas et al. 2012), 2008es (Miller et al.\n2009; Gezari et al. 2009), 2008fz (Drake et al. 2010),\n2008ma (Chatzopoulos et al. 2011), 2010gx (PTF10cwr,\nPastorello et al.\n2010;\nQuimby et al.\n2011),\nSCP\n06F6 (Barbary et al. 2009). PTF09atu, PTF09cnd,\nPTF09cwl, (Quimby et al. 2011), PS1-10ky, PS1-10awh\n(Chomiuk et al. 2011), and CSS100217 (Drake et al. 2011).\nSee also Richardson et al. (2002) for other earlier candidates. These SNe have an absolute magnitude of about\n\u221222 mag in optical. Some of them are classified as Type\nIIn (e.g., Ofek et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2007), or Type IIL,\nwhich is a subclass of Type II SNe with the linear light\ncurve decline (Miller et al. 2009; Gezari et al. 2009), and\nothers are hydrogen poor (Type Ibc, e.g., Pastorello et al.\n2010; Quimby et al. 2011).\nThe nature of these superluminous SNe is poorly\nknown. Some of them are powered by the circumstellar interaction, or by the shock breakout from the dense circumstellar medium (Chevalier & Irwin 2011; Moriya & Tominaga\n2011), as suggested by the presence of narrow emission lines\nin superluminous Type IIn SNe (e.g., Agnoletto et al. 2009).\nIt is also argued that superluminous SNe could be powered\nby a large amount of 56 Ni which is synthesized as a result of energetic core-collapse SNe (Umeda & Nomoto 2008;\nYoung et al. 2010; Moriya et al. 2010). Other scenarios include the interaction between shells ejected by the pulsational pair-instability (Woosley, Blinnikov & Heger 2007),\n\nand SNe powered by a magnetar (Maeda et al. 2007;\nKasen & Bildsten 2010; Woosley 2010).\nAlthough the origin of the high luminosity is not yet\nfully understood, the progenitors of the superluminous SNe\nare thought to be very massive. The long time-scale of the\nlight curve is suggestive of a long diffusion times of optical photons and hence of a large mass of ejecta (for a given\nkinetic energy). At least one progenitor of Type IIn SN is directly identified to be as luminous as luminous blue variables\nwith the zero-age main sequence mass of MZAMS > 50 \u2212\n80M\u2299 (Gal-Yam et al. 2007; Gal-Yam & Leonard 2009).\nSuperluminous SNe may provide an important information on the star formation in the high-redshift Universe.\nBecause superluminous SNe are likely to be triggered by the\nvery massive end of the stellar population, the relative occurence rate of such SNe with respect to the overall star\nformation rate can be a sensitive probe of the slope of the\nstellar initial mass function (IMF). Theoretical studies suggest that the shape of the IMF may be different in the early\nUniverse, or could even be of top-heavy one (e.g., Larson\n1998). Detecting superluminous SNe at high redshifts will\ngive a direct evidence for such non-standard IMF.\nIn this paper, we study the detectability of superluminous SNe at high redshifts with the upcoming wide-field surveys. Quimby et al. (2011) noted that superluminous SNe\nare bright enough that they can be detectable even at z \u223c 4\nwith 8m-class telescopes, such as Subaru and LSST. We derive a realistic estimate for the detectability for a few particular set of surveys. For the optical survey, we focus on\nthe proposed survey with the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam\n(HSC, Miyazaki et al. 2006). The method of mock observations is described in Section 2. We show that with a realistic survey strategy we can detect superluminous SNe to\nz \u223c 4 \u2212 5 (Section 3). More emphasis is made on the detectability by upcoming NIR survey utilizing future satellites, such as Euclid1 , The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) 2 , and Wide-field Imaging Surveyor for\nHigh-redshift (WISH) 3 (Section 4). We study how the expected number of detection at z > 3 is affected by the slope\nof the IMF at the massive end. Details of the sample selection are described in Section 5. Finally, we give our concluding remarks in Section 6.\nThroughout the paper, we assume the \u03a9M = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 cosmology, which is\nconsistent with, e.g., Komatsu et al. (2011). The magnitudes\nare given in the AB magnitude when nothing is mentioned.\n\n2\n\nSETUP FOR MOCK OBSERVATIONS\n\nWe perform simulations of mock observations to study the\ndetectability of superluminous SNe at high redshift. To this\nend, we need (1) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of superluminous SNe and their time evolution, (2) cosmic occurrence rate of superluminous SNe, and (3) a few key observational parameters, i.e., the depth, the area, and the cadence\nof observations. In the following subsections, we describe the\nsetup for our simulations.\n1\n2\n3\n\nhttp://sci.esa.int/euclid\nhttp://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov\nhttp://www.wishmission.org/en/index.html\nc - RAS, MNRAS 000, 1 - ??\n\n\fDetectability of High-Redshift Superluminous Supernovae\n-23\n\n\u221222.5\n\n-22.5\n\nAB magnitude\n\n\u221222\n\u221221.5\n\u221221\n\u221220.5\n\nDay 0\nDay 20\nDay 40\nDay 60\n\n\u221220\n\u221219.5\n\u221219\n\nAbsolute magnitude\n\n\u221223\n\n3\n\nu\ng\nr\ni\nz\n\n-22\n-21.5\n-21\n-20.5\n-20\n-19.5\n-19\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nRest wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nDays (rest frame)\n\nFigure 1.

Although the SEDs of SN 2008es may not\napply to all the superluminous SNe, it is reasonable to assume that superluminous SNe have a bluer colour than other\ntypes of SNe (Quimby et al. 2011).\n\n\u221223\nBlackbody (T=15,000K)\nPTF09cnd\n\nAB magnitude\n\n\u221222.5\n\u221222\n\u221221.5\n\u221221\n\u221220.5\n\nPTF10cwr (SN 2010gx)\n\n\u221220\n\u221219.5\n\u221219\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nRest wavelength (\u00c5)\nFigure 2.

(2011) and photometric data are from\nQuimby et al. (2011); Pastorello et al. (2010).\n\n2.1\n\nSED of Superluminous Supernovae\n\nAs our fiducial model, we use the observed SED of SN 2008es\n(Miller et al. 2009; Gezari et al. 2009). SN 2008es is a wellobserved object among superluminous SNe. The SED can be\napproximately described by blackbody radiation with temperature of 6000 \u2212 15000 K depending on the phase. We\nadopt the model by Miller et al. (2009) for the luminosity\nand the blackbody temperature. Note that the SED is not\ncorrected for host galaxy extinction. We assume a cut-off of\nthe flux at the wavelengths shorter than the Lyman limit.\nThe model SED and rest-frame light curves for SN 2008es\nare shown in Figure 1. Around the maximum brightness, the\nblackbody temperature is \u223c 15000 K, and the peak wavelength is found at about 3000 \u00c5.\nIt is known that there is a variety of SEDs of superluminous SNe; some SNe show H features while other do\nnot. Figure 2 shows the SEDs of hydrogen poor superluminous SNe PTF09cnd (Quimby et al. 2011) and PTF10cwr\n(SN 2010gx, Pastorello et al. 2010; Quimby et al. 2011). For\ncomparison, the blackbody spectrum with T = 15, 000\nK is also shown, which is assumed in our fiducial model\nc - RAS, MNRAS 000, 1 - ??\n\nThe characteristic time scale of the luminosity evolution differs among superluminous SNe (see e.g., Figure S1\nof Quimby et al. 2011). For example, the bolometric light\ncurve of SN 2008es declines by 0.85 dex in 50 days while that\nof PTF09cnd declines only 0.25 dex in the same period. Our\nfiducial model is based on SN 2008es, which yields conservative estimates for the number of detections. We also perform\nsimulations by using the blackbody model for PTF09cnd by\nQuimby et al. (2011) to see the dependence on the model.\nWe also note that dense observations of SN 2008es were\ndone only after its maximum brightness. We do not extrapolate the light curve before the maximum (Figure 1), and do\nnot count SNe in the early phase. Consequently, our simulations give conservative estimates. We argue that, if the light\ncurve has a symmetric shape, the number of detections can\nincrease up to by a factor of 2.\nSN 2008es has a peak magnitude of \u221222 mag in g-band,\nwhereas some of superluminous SNe have even a brighter\nmagnitude up to \u221223 mag (e.g., Quimby et al. 2007, 2011).\nIt is not yet clear if the superluminous SNe are the objects\nat the luminous end of the luminosity function of normal\ncore-collapse SNe, or they form an independent population.\nFor our simulations, we assume the latter case, and adopt a\nGaussian luminosity function with the g-band peak magnitude of \u221222 mag. Since the dispersion of the peak magnitude\nis not well constrained, we adopt a small value (0.3 mag)\nso that the results are not affected by the luminous end of\nthe luminosity function. Note that this luminosity function\ncrudely includes the effect of extinction in the host galaxies,\nbecause the host extinction is not corrected in most of the\nliterature.\nTo perform realistic mock observations, we also include\nType Ia, Type IIP, and Type Ibc SNe in our simulations.\nFor the SEDs of these types, we use spectral templates by\n\n\fTanaka et al.\n\n4\n\ndN/dzd\u03a9dt (deg-2 yr-1 redshift-1)\n\n-5\n\nSN rate (Mpc-3 yr-1)\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nRedshift\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nRedshift\n\nFigure 3. The cosmic occurrence rate of superluminous SNe assumed in the present paper. The left panel shows the rate per volume,\nwhile the right panel shows the rate per area per unit redshift. Two solid lines show the cases for fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 (top) and 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n(bottom). See text for the efficiency parameter fSLSN .\n\nNugent, Kim & Perlmutter (2002) 4 . For their luminosity\nfunctions, we assume observed average peak R-band Vega\nmagnitudes and dispersion of nearby SNe, i.e., MR = \u221218.6\nmag (\u03c3 =0.8 mag), \u221216.1 mag (\u03c3 =1.2 mag) and \u221216.1\nmag (\u03c3 =1.4 mag), for Type Ia, IIP and Ibc SNe, respectively (Li et al. 2011).\n2.2\n\nSupernova Rate\n\nSuperluminous SNe are likely to be the explosions of massive progenitors. It is reasonable to assume that the occurrence rate is proportional to the cosmic star formation rate\n\u03c1\u2217 (z) without significant time delay. We assume the minimum zero-age main sequence mass for superluminous SNe\nto be Mmin,SLSN = 50M\u2299 , which is the minimum mass of luminous blue variables (Gal-Yam et al. 2007). Suppose only a\nsmall fraction fSLSN of massive stars (with > 50M\u2299 ) explode\nas superluminous SNe. Then the rate of the superluminous\nSNe as a function of redshift RSLSN (z) can be calculated as\n\nR Mmax,SLSN\nMmin,SLSN\n\nRSLSN (z) = fSLSN \u03c1\u2217 (z) R Mmax\nMmin\n\n\u03c8(M )dM\n\nM \u03c8(M )dM\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8(M ) is the stellar IMF\n\u03c8(M ) \u221d M \u2212(\u0393+1) .\n\n(2)\n\nWe\nadopt\na\nmodified\nSalpeter\nA\nIMF\nof\nBaldry & Glazebrook (2003) with the slope \u0393 = 0.5\nfor 0.1M\u2299 < M < 0.5M\u2299 and \u0393 = 1.35 for\n0.5M\u2299 < M < 100M\u2299 . The other parameters in Eq.\n(1) are, the minimum mass of stars Mmin = 0.1M\u2299 , the\nmaximum mass of stars Mmax = 100M\u2299 , and the maximum\nmass of superluminous SNe Mmax,SLSN = 100M\u2299 . For the\nstar formation rate, we use the parametrized prescription\nby Hopkins & Beacom (2006) with a modified Salpeter A\nIMF.\nThe fraction of superluminous SNe, fSLSN , is not well\ndetermined. It is indeed one of the important goals of upcoming surveys to anchor the rate of such events to understand the population of progenitors. In the present paper,\n4\n\nhttp://supernova.lbl.gov/~ nugent/nugent_templates.html\n\nwe calibrate this fraction with the available observations\nso far. Quimby et al. (2011) estimated the rate of hydrogen poor superluminous SNe to be about 10\u22128 Mpc\u22123 yr\u22121\nat z \u2243 0.3, which is only 10\u22124 of total core-collapse SNe.\nThis fraction corresponds to fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 of massive\nstars with > 50M\u2299 . Including hydrogen rich superluminous\nSNe, such as superluminous Type IIn SNe, the rate can be\nhigher. Thus, in our simulations, we adopt fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n- 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 , i.e., 10\u22124 - 10\u22123 of total core-collapse SNe are\nsuperluminous SNe.\nThe left panel of Figure 3 shows the rate of the superluminous SNe. The rate lies roughly between 10\u22127 and\n10\u22126 Mpc\u22123 yr\u22121 in the redshift range we are most interested in. The SN rate per volume per year can be readily\nconverted to the number per redshift per field (solid angle\n\u03a9) and per a certain duration of observations as\ndN\n1 dVcom\n= RSLSN (z)\n,\nd\u03a9 dt dz\n1 + z d\u03a9dz\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Vcom is the comoving volume. The right panel of Figure 3 shows the number of SNe per 1 square degree, per 1\nyear, and per redshift. The number of superluminous SNe\nat z \u223c 2 is about unity within 1 deg2 per year, and does not\ndecrease significantly to z \u223c 4.\n2.3\n\nSurvey Strategy\n\nWe primarily consider three types of surveys with different\nsurvey area, depth, cadence, and wavelength (Table 1). In\npractice, deep imaging observations must be performed before each survey to make a reference image. The transient\nsurvey described below will be performed after such reference observations.\nFirst, we adopt the proposed parameters for the deep\nlayer of the Subaru/HSC survey (hereafter called HSCDeep). The survey is planned to cover 30 deg2 . The same\nfield will be visited twice per month with a 6-day cadence\naround the new-moon phase. Such observations will be repeated for continuous 3 months.\nWe define the survey cadence with 3 parameters; n1\nand \u2206t are the number of visits and its cadence within one\nmonth, and n2 is the number of monthly visits. Thus, for\nHSC-Deep, n1 = 2, \u2206t = 6 days, and n2 = 3.\nc - RAS, MNRAS 000, 1 - ??\n\n\fDetectability of High-Redshift Superluminous Supernovae\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

The planned survey\ndepth is summarized in Table 1. For HSC-Deep, the exposure time required to reach the designated depths is 12 min\nfor g and r bands, and 18 min for i, z, and y bands.\nThe second survey we consider is the Ultra Deep layer of\nSubaru/HSC survey (hereafter HSC-UltraDeep). It will observe two Subaru/HSC fields (3.5 deg2 in total) with deeper\nmagnitude limits and more frequent cadence (see Table 1).\nThe required exposure times for these limits are 30 min, 30\nmin, 60 min, 90 min, and 90 min for g, r, i, z, and y band, respectively. The same field will be observed 3 times per month\nwith a 6-day cadence, and this sequence will be repeated for\n4 months, i.e., n1 = 3, \u2206t = 6 days, and n2 = 4.\nFinally, we explore SN detection by NIR surveys. We\npropose a hypothetical survey with a wide area of 100 deg2 ,\nwhich will be made possible by future satellite missions such\nas Euclid, WFIRST and WISH. For the transmission curve\nof NIR filters, the broad band filters of JWST are used 5 .\nWe assume a constant depth of 26.0 mag for 5 bands in 1-5\n\u03bcm. For the NIR survey, we assume only one visit per month\n(n1 = 1) for continuous 6 months (n2 = 6).\n\n2.4\n\nMethods of Simulations\n\nIn this subsection we describe the details of our mock observations. We first generate superluminous SNe according to\nthe SN rate in the right panel of Figure 3 and the adopted\nsurvey area assumed for each survey strategy. The observed\nlight curve of each superluminous SN at a certain redshift\nis calculated from the SED in Figure 1 with appropriate Kcorrection (Hogg et al. 2002). Here the luminosity of each\nSN is assigned according to the luminosity function (with a\nGaussian probability distribution). The date of explosion is\ndetermined by a random number. In this way, we generate\nexpected light curves of superluminous SNe at a range of\nredshifts.\nThen we perform mock observations. The magnitude\nof superluminous SNe are compared with the limiting magnitude of the survey specified by \u2206t, n1 and n2 (see Table\n1). We do not consider contamination of the host galaxy,\ni.e., the detection limit in Table 1 is kept constant for all\nthe objects. Strictly speaking, this is not the case when an\nobject is discovered near a bright galaxy. However, for highredshift superluminous SNe, the host galaxies are expected\n\n5\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instruments/nircam/\ninstrumentdesign/filters/index_html\nc - RAS, MNRAS 000, 1 - ??\n\n5 \u03c3 limiting magnitude per visit\nmr\nmi\nmz\n\nn2\n\nmy\n\n26.1\n26.9\n\n25.8\n26.6\n\n25.6\n26.6\n\n24.5\n25.6\n\n23.2\n24.3\n\nmF 115W\n\nmF 200W\n\nmF 277W\n\nmF 356W\n\nmF 444W\n\n26.0\n\n26.0\n\n26.0\n\n26.0\n\n26.0\n\n1\n\nfdetect\n\nSurvey\n\n0.1\n\nHSC Deep\nHSC Ultra Deep\nNIR Deep\n0.01\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nRedshift\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 4.

Only SNe that\nfulfill both of the following two criteria are counted as \"detected\"; (1) brighter than 5 \u03c3 detection limit in more than\n2 bands at least at one epoch, and (2) brighter than the 5 \u03c3\ndetection limit at more than 3 epochs at least in one band.\nTypically, we generate light curves for 1000 superluminous\nSNe per one run. The simulations are performed 1000 times,\nand the number of the detection is averaged over the realizations.\n\n3\n\nDETECTABILITY WITH OPTICAL SURVEY\n\nWe first calculate the detection efficiency for the three surveys we propose. The detection efficiency is defined to be\nthe ratio of the detected number of SNe to the total number of SNe exploded in the survey period. The green and\nblue lines in Figure 4 show the detection efficiency (fdetect )\nof superluminous SNe for HSC-Deep and HSC-UltraDeep,\nrespectively. We see rapid drop in fdetect at z \u223c 3 \u2212 4 and\nz \u223c 4 \u2212 5 for Deep and for Ultra Deep, respectively. These\nlimiting redshifts corresponds to the redshifts where superluminous SNe with the mean absolute magnitude \u221222 mag\nbecomes undetectable in z-band (see Appendix A for the\nSEDs in observer's frame). HSC-Deep is almost complete\nup to z \u223c 3 while HSC-UltraDeep is complete up to z \u223c 4.\nThe efficiency at lower redshift is not unity because of our\nsomewhat stringent detection criteria. If we impose a looser\n\n\f6\n\nTanaka et al.\n40\n\nSuperluminous SN (z=3.0)\nSN Ia (z=1.0)\nSN IIP (z=0.3)\nSN Ibc (z=0.3)\n\nHSC Deep\n\n35\n30\n\n24\n\n25\nN\n\ni-band magnitude\n\n23\n\n25\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n26\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n150\nDays (observer's frame)\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n5\n\n6\n\nRedshift\n\nFigure 5.

The light curve is compared with that of Type Ia (black), Type IIP (blue), and Type Ibc\n(green) SNe at lower redshifts. Photometric errors shown here are\ncomputed according to the limiting magnitudes in Table 1. The\nlight curves of Type Ia SNe and Type Ibc SNe are shifted toward\nthe right for clarity.\n\n10\nHSC Ultra Deep\n8\n\nN\n\n6\n4\n\ncriteria, for example, > 5\u03c3 detection at only 2 epochs, the\nefficiency becomes nearly unity at low redshifts. The efficiency and its redshift dependence are not largely affected\neven when PTF09cnd, which has a slower light curve than\nour fiducial model, is used as our input model.\nIt is worth mentioning that SNe exploded before the\nsurvey period can also be detected. This effect is not included in the detection efficiency, but such SNe are included\nin the detection number shown below.\nFigure 5 shows a few examples of simulated light curves.\nPhotometric errors are computed according to the limiting\nmagnitudes in Table 1. The i-band light curve of a superluminous SNe is shown by the red points. It is compared\nwith those of other types of SNe. Superluminous SNe at\nz \u223c 3 have comparable magnitude with other types of SNe\nat z <\n\u223c 1. Since the observed i-band wavelength corresponds\nto the rest-UV wavelengths, the decline rate of superluminous SNe is not extremely long. The observed time-scale is\nslightly longer than that of Type Ia and Ibc SNe, but shorter\nthan that of Type IIP SNe at plateau phase.\nWhen PTF09cnd is used as input, the observed brightness of a model superluminous SN at z = 3 decreases as\nslowly as that of Type IIP SNe at z = 0.3. In this case, about\n50 % of the superluminous SNe detected with the HSC-Deep\ndo not show the variability larger than 1 mag in any band.\n6\nIt is thus important to have deep reference images before\nthe survey, otherwise such SNe would be missed.\nThe expected number of detection of superluminous\nSNe with each layer of the survey is shown in Figure 6.\nTwo solid lines show the cases for fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 (top)\nand 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 (bottom). Our reasonable guess is that the\ntrue number will lie in between them. The total number of\n\n6\n\nThe fraction of SNe with a small variability (< 1 mag) is only \u223c\n15 % when the model of SN 2008es is used. This fraction becomes\nsmaller if the baseline the survey period is longer. For example,\nif the HSC-Deep is performed over 6 months keeping the total\nnumber of visit, i.e., n1 = 1 and n2 = 6, the fraction of the small\nvariability case is only 20 % for the PTF09cnd model, and almost\n0 % for the SN 2008es model.\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nRedshift\n\n4\n\nFigure 6. Expected number of detection as a function of redshift\nfor HSC-Deep (upper panel) and HSC-UltraDeep (lower panel).\nThe two solid lines show the cases for fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 (top)\nand 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 (bottom). The total number of detection is 15-150\nfor HSC-Deep and 3-30 for HSC-UltraDeep.\n\ndetection is 15-150 for the Deep layer, and 3-30 for the Ultra Deep layer. If PTF09cnd is used as input, these numbers\nincrease by 20 % because of the slow luminosity evolution.\nFor both the layers, the median redshift is found to be\nz \u223c 2, where the star formation rate and hence the intrinsic SN rate has a peak. The wider survey area of HSC-Deep\ngives a larger number of detection at z = 1\u22123. In the future,\na dedicated deep survey by LSST will discover more superluminous SNe. If a similar depth is achieved, for example,\nin the deep drilling field (LSST Science Collaborations et al.\n2009), the expected number of detection is simply proportional to the survey area.\nWe expect that the rate of superluminous SNe at\nz \u223c 1 \u2212 3 is accurately determined with HSC-Deep. HSCUltraDeep can possibly detect superluminous SNe even at\nz \u223c 5 if fSLSN = 2\u00d710\u22122 . This is in contrast to PISNe, which\nwe can detect only at z < 2 with LSST (Pan, Loeb & Kasen\n2011). The highest redshift of superluminous SNe depends\non the intrinsic rate of superluminous SNe, which can be observationally constrained by HSC-Deep. We emphasize that\nsurveys with the 2 layers are important to understand first\nthe properties of the superluminous SNe (Deep layer) and\nthen to detect highest-redshift SNe (Ultra Deep layer).\nc - RAS, MNRAS 000, 1 - ??\n\n\fDetectability of High-Redshift Superluminous Supernovae\n4\n\nF200W magnitude\n\n23\nSuperluminous SN (z=6.0)\nSN Ia (z=1.0)\nSN IIP (z=0.3)\nSN Ibc (z=0.3, F115W)\n\n4.1\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250 300\nDays (observer's frame)\n\n350\n\n400\n\nFigure 7.

The light curves of Type Ia SNe and\nType IIP SNe are shifted toward the right for clarity.\n\nNIR Deep\n\nNIR SURVEY\nExpected Number of Detection\n\nIt is likely that a NIR survey is more efficient than the optical\nsurveys to detect high redshift superluminous SNe. The red\nline in Figure 4 shows the detection efficiency for our proposed NIR survey. The efficiency is approximately constant\nat z = 0 \u2212 6. The maximum efficiency is 0.5 simply because\nwe require detection at 3 epochs. Most superluminous SNe\nup to z \u223c 6 are above the detection limit. However, because\nof our criteria, superluminous SNe occured in the latter 3\nmonths in the survey period are not included in Figure 4.\nUsing NIR bands is essential to perform a complete survey\nat redshift z > 3.\nFigure 7 shows the simulated light curves of superluminous SNe (red) compared with other types of SNe. Thanks\nto the high rest-UV luminosity (Figure 1), superluminous\nSNe even at z = 6 can be as bright as 24-25 mag at 2 \u03bcm.\nBecause of the time dilation, the light curve of superluminous SNe at high redshifts has a long time-scale in NIR.\nThe expected number of detection is shown in Figure 8.\nIt is highly interesting that, with a 100 deg2 survey, hundreds\nof z > 2 SNe can possibly be discovered. The total number\nof SNe is 120 and 1200 for the cases of fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\nand 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 , respectively.

The\noccurrence rate is very sensitive to the number fraction of\nsuch massive stars. This in turn can be used, if the occurence\nrate is accurately determined, to probe the slope of the IMF\nat the massive end (Cooke et al. 2009). We calculate the sensitivity of the expected number of the detection to the slope\nof the stellar IMF. For simplicity, we fix the minimum mass\nof superluminous SNe (Mmin,SLSN) and the fraction of superluminous SNe (fSLSN ) for the following comparison. Note\nthat these parameters can be observationally constrained by\nthe optical survey as we discussed in Section 3. To study the\ninfluence of the relative fraction of massive stars, we change\nthe slope of the IMF at the large mass > 50M\u2299 , whereas\nkeeping the slope at < 50M\u2299 to be 1.35. It is important to\nnote that changing the IMF at the high-mass end has little impact to the calibration of the star formation rate since\nmost UV continuum emission comes from massive stars with\n< 50M\u2299 . Thus the occurence rate of superluminous SNe is\na robust probe of the stellar IMF.\nFigure 9 shows the cumulative number of detection at\nz = 3 \u2212 6 as a function of \u0393, the slope of the IMF. Here the\nfraction of superluminous SNe is conservatively assumed to\nbe fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Even in this case, with \u0393 < 1.1, the\nexpected number can be about three times as much as that\nwith \u0393 = 1.35. Thus, if the star formation rate is independently measured, and if the SN rate can be determined with\nan accuracy within a factor of 3, the very flat slope of the\nmassive end of the IMF can be inferred, or rejected.\n\n\f8\n\nTanaka et al.\n3\n\n2\n\nz=1.5\n\n2\n\nz=5\n\n1.5\nr-i\n\nz=1.0\n\n1\n\nz=4\nz=3\n\n0.5\n\nz=0.5\nz=0.3\n\n-0.5\n-0.4 -0.2\n\n1\n\nz=1.0\nz=2.0\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n\nz=0.5\n\n0\n\nSuperluminous SN\nSN Ia\nSN IIP\nSN Ibc\n\n3\n\n[1.2] - [2.0]\n\n2.5\n\n4\nSuperluminous SN\nSN Ia\nSN IIP\nSN Ibc\n\nz=6\nz=5\nz=4\nz=0.3\nz=0.2\nz=0.5\n\nz=0.3\n\nz=0.2\n\n-3\n\nz=0.3\n\n-4\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\ni-z\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n[2.0] - [2.8]\n\nFigure 10. Optical (left) and NIR (right) colour-colour diagram for various types of SNe. Our template superluminous SN 2008es at\nhigh redshifts (red) are compared with Type Ia SNe (black), Type IIP SNe (blue), and Type Ibc SNe (green) at low redshifts. The\nredshift of Type Ia, IIP, and Ibc SNe are selected so that the observed magnitudes are similar to those of high-redshift superluminous\nSNe. Colours at different epochs are connected with lines, and the square shows the colour at maximum brightness. In optical, colours\nof superluminous SNe at high redshifts are red both in r \u2212 i and i \u2212 z, compared with Type IIP SNe and Type Ibc SNe. Only Type Ia\nSNe at redshift z = 1.5 can have colours redder than superluminous SNe both in r \u2212 i and i \u2212 z. In NIR, superluminous SNe at high\nredshifts are redder than any other types of SNe with similar observed brightness. For the detailed SED, see Appendix A.\n\n5\n\nNOTES ON THE SAMPLE SELECTION\n\nSo far we have discussed the number of detectable SNe of a\nparticular type, but have not fully evaluated the efficiency of\ntarget selection for actual surveys. Because superluminous\nSNe are intrinsically rare events, upcoming optical surveys\nusing 8m-class telescope, such as Subaru and LSST, and\nNIR surveys with Euclid, WFIRST, and WISH, will discover\nmore Type Ia and ordinary core-collapse SNe. These normal\nSNe will be more abundant than superluminous SNe by a\nfactor of about 100. Thus, to identify superluminous SNe at\nhigh redshifts, we must select the candidates properly and\nefficiently.\nCooke (2008) propose a method to select Type IIn SNe\nfrom colour-selected Lyman break galaxies. The advantage\nof the method is that the photometric redshift of the host\ngalaxy is already known. When Lyman break galaxies at\nz > 2 are selected, most of SN candidates found in this\nsample are likely to be Type IIn SNe or superluminous SNe.\nHere we consider the characteristics of superluminous\nSNe in a more general case. An important issue would be\nthat the host galaxy of a distant SNe is likely to be too faint\nto be detected. We summarize the properties of (1) light\ncurve and its time scale, (2) colours, and (3) host galaxies\nof superluminous SNe at high redshifts.\nThe observed time-scale is determined by the intrinsic time-scale and the time dilation due to cosmological\nredshift. Superluminous SNe observed so far indeed tend\nto show an intrinsically long time-scale. For an extreme\ncase, the brightness of SN 2006gy stayed within 1 magnitude below the maximum for about 100 days. Other objects such as 2008es (Miller et al. 2009; Gezari et al. 2009),\nSCP 06F6 (Barbary et al. 2009). PTF09atu, PTF09cnd,\nPTF09cwl (Quimby et al. 2011) also have a long time-scale.\nTheir decline tends to be faster in bluer bands (Figure 1).\nIn optical surveys, we observe high-redshift superluminous SNe at the rest-UV wavelengths. The observed time-\n\nscale of superluminous SNe is slightly longer than that of\nType Ia and Ibc SNe, and shorter than Type IIP SNe (Figure 5), when we use SN 2008es as a template. When we use\nPTF09cnd as a template instead, the light curve is as slow\nas Type IIP SNe. With such a slowly evolving light curve,\nit may be difficult to distinguish superluminous SNe from\nType IIP SNe.\nIn NIR surveys, the long time-scale of superluminous\nSNe is pronounced (Figure 7). Since NIR wavelengths traces\n>\nthe rest-frame optical at z >\n\u223c 2, superluminous SNe at z \u223c 2\ncan stay detectable for more than 100 days thanks to both\nthe intrinsic brightness and the dilation effect (Figure 7).\nAs a result, the time-scale is longer than any other types of\nSNe.\nThe second diagnostic is the observed colour. Figure\n10 shows optical r \u2212 i vs. i \u2212 z (left) and NIR F115WF200W ([1.2]-[2.0]) vs. F200W-F277W ([2.0]-[2.8], right)\ncolour-colour diagrams. Colours of our template superluminous SN 2008es at high redshifts are shown in red. For\ncomparison, we also show the expected colours of Type Ia\nSNe at z = 1.0 and 1.5 (black), Type IIP SNe at (blue),\nand Type Ibc SNe (green) at z = 0.3 and 0.5. These SNe\nare expected to have similar observed magnitudes to those\nof superluminous SNe at z > 3. The colours of these types\nof SNe are calculated by using the spectral templates by\nNugent, Kim & Perlmutter (2002). See Appendix A for the\nSEDs. The reddening in the host galaxy is not taken into\naccount here. It is worth mentioning that there is a scatter\nin optical colour of observed SNe at low redshifts. Including\nthe contribution from the host galaxy, the scatter is typically\nabout 1.0 mag for Type IIP and 0.5 mag for Type Ibc SNe\n(e.g., Olivares E. et al. 2010; Drout et al. 2011). For Type\nIa SNe, a wide color spread is known, but most objects have\nsimilar colours within 0.2-0.4 mag (e.g., Wang et al. 2009).\nSuperluminous SNe at high redshifts tend to have redder colour than Type IIP and Ibc SNe both in r \u2212i and i\u2212z.\nc - RAS, MNRAS 000, 1 - ??\n\n\fDetectability of High-Redshift Superluminous Supernovae\nFor superluminous SNe at high redshifts, the observed r, i, z\nwavelengths correspond to the near-UV wavelengths in the\nrest frame, which are at the blueside of the spectral peak.\nOn the other hand, most of Type IIP and Ibc SNe with optical surveys will be discovered at z <\n\u223c 1. Their observed r \u2212 i\nand i \u2212 z colours still trace the optical wavelengths in the\nrest frame. Thus, colours of superluminous SNe at high redshifts tend to be redder than those of Type IIP and Ibc SNe\n(see also Appendix A). In optical wavelengths, only Type\nIa SNe at z >\n\u223c 1 have a similarly red or redder colour than\nsuperluminous SNe. 7\nThe red colour of superluminous SNe is more prominent\nin NIR wavelengths. See the right panel of Figure 10. NIR\nwavelengths traces the blue optical or near UV wavelength of\nsuperluminous SNe at high redshifts (see Appendix A). For\nother types of SNe, observed NIR wavelengths correspond\nto the red optical (Type Ia) or NIR (Type IIP and Ibc) in\ntheir rest frames. Therefore, NIR colours of superluminous\nSNe at high redshifts tend to be redder than those of other\ntypes of SNe. The red colour of superluminous SNe results\nsimply from the fact that they are at high redshifts. Thus,\ntheir red color does not depend largely on the choice of the\ntemplate SEDs.\nThe last characteristic is the faintness of the host galaxies of superluminous SNe. An obvious reason for this is\nthe distance to the host galaxies. Interestingly, Neill et al.\n(2011) argue that the host galaxies of superluminous SNe\nhave a faint intrinsic luminosity; most of them have an ab8\nsolute r-band magnitudes of >\n\u223c \u221220 mag . They also have\nquite blue UV-optical colours N U V \u2212 r = 0. If there is no\nredshift evolution in the host galaxy population, the optical magnitudes of the host galaxies at z >\n\u223c 3 are likely to\nbe close to the detection limit. This is in contrast to Type\nIa SNe at z = 1 \u2212 1.5, whose host galaxies were identified\nin optical wavelengths with mi = 23-26 mag (Graur et al.\n2011). Overall, faintness or non-detection of the host galaxies of the high redshift superluminous SNe may indeed be of\nhelp with sample selection in addition to the characteristic\nfeatures in the light curve and colour.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe study the detectability of superluminous SNe with upcoming optical and NIR surveys. By assuming that the progenitors of superluminous SNe are more massive than 50\nM\u2299 and a fraction fSLSN = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 - 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 of these\nmassive stars explode as superluminous SNe (or the rate of\nsuperluminous SNe are 10\u22124 - 10\u22123 of total core-collapse\nSNe), the cosmic occurrence rate of superluminous SNe is\n\nabout 0.5-5 deg\u22122 yr\u22121 redshift\u22121 at z \u223c 1 \u2212 3 and about\n0.1-1 deg\u22122 yr\u22121 redshift\u22121 at z \u223c 4 \u2212 5.\nWe predict that 15-150 superluminous SNe up to z \u223c 4\nwill be detected with the Deep layer of the upcoming Subaru/HSC survey if all the objects meeting our detection criteria are indeed selected. About the half of them are at\nz > 2. By the Deep layer, the cosmic occurrence rate of\nsuperluminous SNe at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3 can be anchored. The Ultra\nDeep layer will discover a smaller number of SNe (3-30), but\nSNe at z \u223c 5 could be detectable. A similarly deep, dedicated survey by LSST will discover more superluminous\nSNe, whose number is simply proportional to the survey\narea.\nWe show that future NIR surveys will detect more than\na few hundreds of superluminous SNe in half a year if 100\ndeg2 field is surveyed with the depth of 26 mag. Even with\nthe conservative estimate of the rate (2 \u00d7 10\u22123 of massive\nstars with > 50M\u2299 , or 10\u22124 of total core-collapse SNe),\nsuch NIR survey will detect about 50 superluminous SNe at\nz > 3.\nSuperluminous SNe at high redshifts can be selected\nin the sample of high-redshift galaxies as demonstrated by\nCooke (2008). Also in the general survey, covering all redshift ranges, superluminous SNe can be distinguished by\nother types of SNe by (1) the observed long time-scale especially, (2) the optical colour redder than Type IIP and Ibc\nSNe, or the NIR colour redder than any other types of SNe,\nand (3) faint host galaxies.\nDetection of high-redshift SNe opens an exciting opportunity to study the massive star population at high redshifts.\nThe progenitor of superluminous SNe is likely to be very\nmassive. Therefore, the detected number is very sensitive to\nthe IMF. If the slope of the IMF is \u0393 < 1.1 at the high\nmass end (M > 50M\u2299 ), the detected number will be increased by a factor of >3. If the star formation rate at z > 3\nis measured with a small uncertainty by other methods, the\ndetected number of superluminous SNe with the NIR survey\ncan be an indicator of top-heavy IMF at the high-redshift\nUniverse.\nThe authors thank Robert Quimby for giving us the spectra\nof PTF09cnd and PTF10cwr, and for fruitful discussion.

Most quasars at z < 4 have\nr \u2212 i = \u22120.5 - 0.5 and i \u2212 z = \u22120.5 - 0.5 (Schneider et al.\n2007), which are bluer than superluminous SNe at high redshifts.\nQuasars at z = 4 \u2212 5 have a red r \u2212 i colour (up to \u223c 2), which\nis comparable to the colour of superluminous SNe and Type Ia\nSNe.\n8 Note however that there could be an observational bias that\nsuperluminous SNe are easily detected if their host galaxies are\nfaint.\nc - RAS, MNRAS 000, 1 - ??\n\n9\n\nREFERENCES\nAgnoletto I. et al., 2009, ApJ, 691, 1348\nBaldry I.
