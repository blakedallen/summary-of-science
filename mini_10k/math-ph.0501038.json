Consider a liquid drop X of a prescribed volume\nthat is adjacent to a solid surface \u03a3, called the support surface. We assume\nthat no chemical reaction occurs between the two materials and these ones\nare homogeneous. We admit the existence of a uniform gravity vector field\npointing toward \u03a3. The energy of the physical system involves the area of the\nregion of contact of X with \u03a3, (the liquid-solid interface) and the surface area\nof the drop (the liquid-air interface). For this reason, we imposes in X and\n1\n\n\f\u03a3 a spacelike causal condition that allows to consider areas of surfaces. This\nleads to that the gravity is a timelike vector field. We seek the configurations\nthat adopt the liquid drop in a state of equilibrium, that is, when the energy\nof the physical system is critical under perturbations of the system that do\nnot change the amount of liquid of X. The parameters that are determined\nphysically can be: i) the support surface and the angle of contact; ii) the area\nof the region that wets the drop and the angle of contact, or iii) the volume\nof the drop and the angle of contact with the support surface.\nFrom the mathematical viewpoint, we are studying the possible shapes of a\nspacelike surface in Minkowski space L3 whose mean curvature is a function of\nits position in space, and which meets a given spacelike surface in a prescribed\nhyperbolic angle. The interior of the liquid drop is a bounded domain X of L3\nwhose boundary \u2202X decomposes into \u2202X = S \u222a \u03a9, where S is the liquid-air\ninterface and \u03a9 = X \u2229 \u03a3 is the region in \u03a3 occupied by the part of the drop\nthat wets on \u03a3. According to the principle of virtual work, and when the\nequilibrium of the system is achieved, the interface S is characterized by the\nequation \u2206x = 2HN for the position vector x on the free surface S; here \u2206\ndenotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator on S, N is a unit timelike vector field\nnormal to S and H is the mean curvature of S. The hyperbolic angle \u03b2 with\nwhich S and \u03a3 intersect along \u2202S = S \u2229\u03a3 is determined as a physical constant\ndepending only on the materials. Physically, the boundary \u2202S corresponds\nwith the liquid-air-solid interface of the system. When X achieves a state of\nequilibrium, we shall say then that X is a stationary liquid drop.\nIn a vertical gravity vector field, the Euler-Lagrange equation for the drop\ninterface requires that H be a linear function of the height, that is,\nH(x) = \u03bax3 (x) + \u03bb,\n\nx \u2208 S,\n\nwhere x3 indicates the third space coordinate. Here \u03ba is the capillarity constant\nand, as the angle \u03b2, depends on the materials involved. The constant \u03bb is a\nLagrange multiplier arising from the volume constraint. On the other hand,\nwhen we talk of contact angle, it is implicitly assumed that the boundary\nregularity of S is enough to ensure that the idea of a normal to S at every\nboundary point makes sense. For this, we will require S to be a sufficiently\nsmooth surface up to the boundary \u2202S.\nWhen \u03ba = 0, no gravity appears in the physical system. In this situation,\nthe liquid drop is modeled by a surface S with constant mean curvature H =\n\u03bb/2. When the support surface is a plane, then the surface is a planar disc\n(H = 0) or a hyperbolic cap (H 6= 0) (see [2] and Theorem 3.1 for another\nproof). In this sense, our interest is focused for the case that \u03ba 6= 0.\n2\n\n\fAlthough in this article we shall consider the case that the support surface is a spacelike plane, other interesting cases can appear for more general\ngeometric configurations, as for example, a hyperbolic plane, or liquid bridges\ninterconnecting a set of spacelike planes and hyperbolic planes (see the end of\nSection 3).\nThis paper is divided in seven sections and organized as follows. We begin\nin Section 2 with a preparatory introduction where we give precise definitions\nand pose the formulation of the problem variational for our physical system.\nNext, we consider stationary liquid drops resting on a spacelike plane \u03a0 in a\nvertical gravity field directed toward \u03a0. We generalize what it occurs for surfaces with constant mean curvature and we shall prove in Section 3, Theorem\n3.1:\nUnder the effect of the gravity, any stationary liquid drop in Minkowski\nspace L3 resting in a spacelike plane \u03a0 is rotationally symmetric\nwith respect to a straight-line orthogonal to \u03a0.\nAssuming then rotational symmetry, the Euler equation becomes an ordinary differential equation for the profile curve that defines the liquid drop. In\nsuccessive sections, we discuss in some detail the solutions of this differential\nequation starting in Section 4 for the problem of existence and uniqueness. As\nconsequence, we prove (Theorems 5.2 and 7.2):\nLet \u03ba be a constant of capillarity. Given a spacelike plane \u03a0 and a\nreal number \u03b2, there exists a stationary liquid drop in Minkowski\nspace L3 supported on \u03a0 and where \u03b2 is the angle of contact between\nthe drop and \u03a0. The drop is unique up isometries of the ambient\nspace L3 .\nAs in Euclidean space, there exists a qualitative difference of shapes that\nadopt a drop according to the sign of \u03ba, that is, sessile liquid drops when \u03ba > 0\nand pendent liquid drops if \u03ba < 0. In Sections 5 and 6 we analyze the size of\nthe shapes that a sessile liquid drop can adopt by deriving estimates of the\nheight, volume and properties of monotonicity. Finally, Section 7 is devoted\nto the study of pendent drops. We refer to the reader these sections for precise\nstatements. These results provide estimates of the drop in terms of prescribed\nvalues. For example (Corollary 6.1)\nLet \u03a0 be a spacelike plane in L3 . Consider \u03b2, R > 0. Then for\nany stationary sessile liquid drop X resting on \u03a0 such that \u03b2 is\n3\n\n\fthe angle of contact and R is the radius of the disc of \u03a0 that wets\nX, the height q of X satisfies:\nq<R\n\ncosh \u03b2 \u2212 1\n,\nsinh \u03b2\n\nWe point up also an existence result in terms of the volume (Theorems 6.7\nand 7.3)\nFor each constant of capillarity \u03ba, \u03b2 \u2208 R and a positive real number\nV, there exists a unique sessile liquid drop and a unique pendent\ndrop resting on a spacelike plane \u03a0 enclosing a liquid of volume V\nand that makes a constant angle \u03b2 along the liquid-air-solid interface.\nWe want to point out although much of our techniques are similar than\nin Euclidean ambient, differences appear in the Lorentzian setting. The main\nfact is that the spacelike condition is a strong geometric restriction for the\npossible configurations. It is worthwhile to bring out some of them:\n1. Liquid drops in L3 can extend to be graphs in the whole plane. This\nmeans that the associated Euler equation can solved be entire solutions.\nOur drops correspond with physical situations of wetting, but dewetting\nis prohibited.\n2. Sessile liquid drops in L3 have not the phenomenon of meniscus. Moreover and by fixing the constant of capillarity, the ambient space L3 can\nbe foliated by sessile drops.\n3. Pendent liquid drops in L3 do not present vertical points. In particular,\nfor any given volume, there exists a pendent drop enclosing that volume\nand that it is physically realizable.\nThere exists an extensive literature relating to liquid drops in Euclidean\nspace. This is due to its interest both in physic and chemistry for any interfacial phenomena in the theory of colloids and new materials. From the\nmathematical viewpoint, we refer to the book of R. Finn [10], which contains\nabundant bibliography. Finally, we remark that much of the results obtained\nhere can be straightforward generalize for spacelike hypersurfaces in Ln+1 .\n4\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries and formulation of the variational\nproblem\n\nIn this section we present the setting for the presence of our stationary liquid\ndrops, as well as, we shall precise the mathematical formulation of the physical\nsituation. Let L3 denote the 3-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space, that is,\nthe real vector space R3 endowed with the Lorentzian metric h, i = dx21 + dx22 \u2212\ndx23 , where x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) are the canonical coordinates in L3 . An immersion\nx : M \u2192 L3 of a smooth surface M is called spacelike if the induced metric on\nM is positive definite. Observe that ~a = (0, 0, 1) is a unit timelike vector field\nglobally defined on L3 , which determines a time-orientation on the space L3 .\nThis allows us to choose a unique unit normal vector field N on M which is in\nthe same time-orientation as ~a, and hence that M is oriented by N . We will\nrefer to N as the future-directed Gauss map of M . In this article all spacelike\nsurfaces will be oriented according to this choice of N .\nThe spacelike condition imposes topological restrictions to the immersion\nx. For example, there are not closed spacelike surfaces and then, any compact\nspacelike surface has non-empty boundary. If \u0393 is a closed curve in L3 and\nx : M \u2192 L3 is a spacelike immersion of a compact surface, we say that the\nboundary of M is \u0393 if the restriction x : \u2202M \u2192 \u0393 is a diffeomorphism. For\nspacelike surfaces, the projection \u03c0 : L3 \u2192 \u03a0 = {x3 = 0}, \u03c0(x1 , x2 , x3 ) =\n(x1 , x2 , 0) is a local diffeomorphism between int(M ) and \u03c0(int(M )). Thus,\n\u03c0 is an open map and \u03c0(int(M )) is a domain in \u03a0. The compactness of M\nimplies that \u03c0 : M \u2192 \u03a9 is a covering map. Thus, we have\nProposition 2.1 Let x : M \u2192 L3 be a compact spacelike surface whose\nboundary \u0393 is a graph over an open region \u03a9 \u2282 {x3 = 0}. Then x(M ) is\na graph over \u03a9.\nAs conclusion, the boundness of our liquid drops means that the liquid-air\ninterface S is a graph on the support surface. We suppose that the boundary\nof a spacelike compact surface is included in a plane \u03a0. This plane must be of\nspacelike-type. We point out also that although the boundary \u2202M is possibly\nnon-connected, the causal character on M implies the existence of a component\nof x(\u2202M ), named \u03930 , such that \u03c0(int(M )) is contained in the bounded domain\ndetermined by \u03930 in \u03a0. Therefore, x(M ) defines an \"interior\" domain, that\nis, there exists a bounded region \u03a9 \u2282 \u03a0 such that x(M ) \u222a \u03a9 determines in R3\na bounded domain B, called the \"interior\" of M .\n5\n\n\fFor spacelike immersions, the notions of the first and second fundamental\nform are defined in the same way as in Euclidean space.

The support surface\n\u03a3 is defined as an embedded connected spacelike surface in L3 that divides\nthe space L3 into two connected components. Let us orient \u03a3 by the futuredirected unit timelike vector field N\u03a3 and consider L3+ the component of L3 \\\u03a3\ntowards N\u03a3 is pointing. Let M be a connected compact surface with boundary\n\u2202M and x : M \u2192 L3 a spacelike immersion, smooth even at \u2202\u03a3 such that\nx(int(M )) \u2282 L3+ and x(\u2202M ) \u2282 \u03a3. A variation of x is a differentiable map\nX : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 M \u2192 L3 such that Xt : M \u2192 L3 , t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb), defined by\nXt (p) = X(t, p), p \u2208 M , is an immersion and X0 = x. The variation is called\nadmissible if Xt (int(M )) \u2282 L3+ and Xt (\u2202M ) \u2282 \u03a3 for all t. The area function\nA : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 R is defined by\nA(t) =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n6\n\ndAt\n\n\fwhere dAt is the area element of M in the metric induced by Xt ; the area\nfunction S : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 R of the wetted surface on \u03a3 is defined by\nZ\n\nS(t) =\n\nd\u03a3,\n\n\u03a9t\n\nthat is, the area of \u03a9t \u2282 \u03a3, the region in \u03a3 bounded by Xt (\u2202M ). Finally, the\nvolume function V : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 R is defined by\nV (t) =\n\nZ\n\n[0,t]\u00d7M\n\nX \u2217 dV,\n\nwhere dV is the canonical volume element of L3 . The number V (t) represents\nthe volume enclosed between the surface X and Xt . The variation X is said\nto be volume-preserving if V (t) = V (0) for all t and the variational vector field\nof X is defined on M by\n\u2202X\n\u03be(p) =\n.\n(p)\n\u2202t\nt=0\nMoreover, we assume the existence of a potential energy Y = Y (p), p \u2208 L3 .\nThe resultant variation energy is\nY (t) =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nY dAt .\n\nThe energy function E : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 R is defined by\nE(t) = A(t) \u2212 cosh \u03b2 S(t) + Y (t),\nwhere \u03b2 \u2208 R is an arbitrary real constant. We say that the immersion x is\nstationary if E \u2032 (0) = 0 for any volume preserving admissible variation of x.\nFor an arbitrary variation, it can be shown that\n\u2032\n\nA (0) = \u22122\nS \u2032 (0) = \u2212\nY \u2032 (0) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nM\n\nHhN, \u03bei dM \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u2202M\n\nh\u03bd, \u03bei ds\n\nh\u03bd\u03a3 , \u03bei ds\n\nY hN, \u03bei dM,\n\nwhere \u03bd and \u03bd\u03a3 are the inward-pointing unitary conormal to M and \u03a9 along\n\u2202M respectively.

Let us consider x : M \u2192 L3 a smooth spacelike immersion such that\nx(int(M )) \u2282 L3+ and x(\u2202M ) \u2282 \u03a3. Then x is stationary if and only if\n1. The mean curvature H of x satisfies the relation\n2H(p) = Y (p) + \u03bb,\n\np \u2208 M,\n\nwhere Y is a potential energy and \u03bb is a Lagrange parameter determined\nby an eventual volume constraint;\n2. The surface S = x(M ) meets the support surface \u03a3 in a constant hyperbolic angle \u03b2, that is, cosh \u03b2 = \u2212hN, N\u03a3 i along \u2202M .\nIn this article, our interest will center on the case for which:\n1. The support surface is a spacelike hyperplane \u03a0. After an isometry, we\nwill assume that \u03a0 is parallel to the plane {x3 = 0} and\n2. The vector field Y (p) is a vertically directed gravitational potential towards \u03a0, that is, Y (p) = \u03ba x3 (p) + \u03bb, for constants \u03ba and \u03bb:\nWe know from Proposition 2.1 that a compact drop resting in spacelike\nplane is the graph of a function u.

Assume that M lies in one\n\nside of \u03a0 and the two following assumptions hold:\n1. The mean curvature H of M depends only on the distance to \u03a0.\n2. The hyperbolic angle of contact between M and \u03a0 is constant along \u2202M .\nThen M is rotational symmetric with respect to a straight-line orthogonal to\n\u03a0. Moreover, M is a topological disc.\nThis result is analogous to it happens in Euclidean ambient and which\nwas proved by Wente [22]. It turns out that the method of proof used there,\ncalled the Alexandrov reflection technique, may be adapted to the present\nsituation. Such technique was firstly used to prove that a closed embedded\nconstant mean curvature surface in R3 must be a round sphere [1]. See also\nthe remarkable reference [20] in the context of the theory of partial differential\nequations. The proof idea is to use the very surface M as comparison surface\nwith itself and to apply the Hopf maximum principle for elliptic equations.\nWe consider ui , i = 1, 2, two functions satisfying\ndiv(T ui ) = 2Hi (x),\n\n|\u2207ui | < 1\n\nin a domain \u03a9, with H1 (x) \u2264 H2 (x).

We write div(T u) =\naij (x, u, \u2207u)uij with p = (p1 , p2 ), pi = ui , and\nwhere\nX\n(1 \u2212 |p|2 )|\u03be|2 + h\u03be, pi2\naij (x, u, p)\u03bei \u03bej =\n.\nW3\nThen it holds\n0 < \u03bb(x, u, p)|\u03be|2 \u2264\n\nX\n\naij (x, u, p)\u03bei \u03bej \u2264 \u039b(x, u, p)|\u03be|2 ,\n\n1\n1\n\u039b(x, u, p) = 3 .\nW\nW\nThen the operator is elliptic for |p| < 1 and uniformly elliptic for compact\ndomains. Let\n\u03c6(x, p, r) = div(T u) = 2H(x)\n(2)\n\u03bb(x, u, p) =\n\nwhere r = (rij ), rij = uij .

For each u = ui , i = 1, 2, we will use the\nnotation pi , r i and Hi for each i . Since H1 \u2264 H2 , a standard argument using\nthe chain rule shows then\n0 \u2264 \u03c6(x, p2 , r 2 ) \u2212 \u03c6(x, p1 , r 1 )\nX Z 1 \u2202\u03c6\nX Z 1 \u2202\u03c6\n(\u03b8(t)) dt wij +\n(\u03b8(t)) dt wj := Lw,\n=\n0 \u2202pj\n0 \u2202rij\nwhere w = u1 \u2212 u2 , wi = \u2202w/\u2202xi , wij = \u2202 2 w/\u2202xi \u2202xj and \u03b8 = \u03b8(t) = (x, tp2 +\n(1 \u2212 t)p1 , tr 2 + (1 \u2212 t)r 1 ).

Since the coefficients aij are locally bounded, L is\nlocally uniformly elliptic and we are in position to apply the Hopf's maximum\nprinciple to the difference function w ([12]; see also [11, Ch. 3]). Consequently,\nwe have proved the following result.\n\n10\n\n\fTheorem 3.2 (The touching principle) Let u, v be two smooth solutions\nto the same prescribed mean curvature equation (2) on a domain \u03a9 \u2282 R2 .\nSuppose that u \u2264 v on \u03a9 and u(x0 ) = v(r0 ), x0 \u2208 \u03a9. Then u(x) = v(x) on\n\u03a9. The same holds if p \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 with the extra hypothesis that \u2202u/\u2202\u03bd = \u2202v/\u2202\u03bd\nat x0 , where \u03bd is the outward unit normal to \u2202\u03a9.\nProof : [of Theorem 3.1] After an ambient isometry, we can suppose that \u03a0 \u2261\n{x3 = 0} and H(x) = H(x3 (x)) for any x \u2208 M . Without loss of generality, we\nassume that M lies over the plane \u03a0. The proof follows the same steps of that\nof Wente [22, Th. 1.1] and for expository reasons, we will describe it briefly.\nLet \u03a9 be the bounded region in \u03a0 bounded by \u2202M such that M \u222a \u03a9 is a\nclosed embedded surface. Let A and B denote, respectively, the nonbounded\nand the interior domain determined by M in R3 . Consider a vertical hyperplane P disjoint from M (so P \u2282 A) and move P parallel to itself (say, to the\nright) until it touches M at a first point q. Now, when moving P a little more\nto the right from q, to a plane P (t), the (closed) part of M on the left of P (t),\nwhich we denote by M (t)\u2212 , is a graph (with respect to the horizontal) over a\ndomain in P (t) and no point of M (t)\u2212 has a horizontal tangent plane.\nLet M (t)+ be the symmetry of M (t)\u2212 through P (t) that it is contained in\nB. Recall that the symmetry with respect to a vertical plane is an isometry of\nL3 , and so, the mean curvature remains invariant by the symmetry. Because\nthe mean curvature of M depends only on the height with respect to \u03a0, the\nmean curvature is the same for all points at the same height. We continue\nnow moving P (t) to the right, and consider the first parallel plane P (\u03c4 ) where\none of the following conditions fails to hold:\n1. int(M (\u03c4 )+ ) \u2282 int(B).\n2. M (\u03c4 )\u2212 is a graph over a part of P (\u03c4 ) and no point of M (\u03c4 )\u2212 has a\nhorizontal tangent plane.\nIf 1) fails first, we have that M and M (\u03c4 )+ touch at some interior point p,\nor at a boundary point p, p \u2208 \u2202M \u2229 \u2202M (\u03c4 )+ where the constancy of the\nhyperbolic angle along \u2202M implies that the tangent planes of M and M (\u03c4 )+\nagree at p. Then one applies the touching principle to M and M (\u03c4 )+ at the\npoint where they touch to conclude that P (\u03c4 ) is a plane of symmetry of M .\nIf 2) fails first, then we have that there exists a point p where the tangent\nplane of M (\u03c4 )\u2212 becomes horizontal is on \u2202(M (\u03c4 )\u2212 ) \u2282 P (\u03c4 ) or p \u2208 \u2202M \u2229 P (\u03c4 ).\nIn the former possibility one can apply the boundary touching principle to\n11\n\n\fM (\u03c4 )+ and the part of M to the right to P (\u03c4 ) to conclude that P (\u03c4 ) is a plane\nof symmetry of M ; in the second one, the corresponding tangent planes of M\nand M (\u03c4 )+ are identical because the hyperbolic angle with the ~a direction is\nthe same at p. Then one applies the maximum principle at a corner point (see\ndetails in [20, 22]).\nThus, for each vertical plane P , some parallel translate of P is a plane of\nsymmetry of M , and M is a surface of revolution. This concludes the proof\nof Theorem.\nq.e.d\n\nq.e.d\n\nFinally we comment other situations where is is possible to apply the Alexandrov reflection method. The physical problem we will consider is that a drop\nof liquid is trapped between two homogeneous parallel spacelike planes \u03a01 and\n\u03a02 , that is, a bounded liquid bridge M . In such case, the term S in the energy\nfunctional E is the area of the domains that the drop wets in each one of the\nplanes. Again, in a state of equilibrium, the angle between the normal to the\nliquid bridge and the normal to \u03a0i along their line of contact is constant (and\npossibly different in each plane \u03a0i ). The Alexandrov reflection method yields\nagain the following\nTheorem 3.3 Let \u03a01 and \u03a02 be two parallel spacelike planes in Minkowski\nspace L3 . Consider M a spacelike embedded compact surface in L3 included in\nthe slab determined by \u03a01 \u222a\u03a02 and whose boundary \u2202M intersects both \u03a01 and\n\u03a02 . Assume that the mean curvature of M depends only on the distance to \u03a0i\nand the hyperbolic angle of contact between M and \u03a0i is constant along \u2202M\nin each one of the two planes. Then M is rotational symmetric with respect\nto a straight-line orthogonal to \u03a0i .\nRemark 3.1 Other interested support surface occurs when \u03a3 is a hyperbolic\nplane. One can believe that the only stationary liquid drops resting on a\nhyperbolic plane are surfaces of revolution. This is true in the situation of no\ngravity, that is, when the mean curvature of the liquid-air interface is constant.\nIn such case, we obtain that the surface must be an umbilical disc [2]. We do\nnot know if the same remains true under the effect of a gravitational vector\nfield.\nRemark 3.2 The study of constant mean curvature surfaces in Euclidean\nspace that makes a constant angle with a prescribed support surface \u03a3 is\n12\n\n\fa focus of interest in differential geometry. When M is a topological disc,\nthere are results that assure that M is a spherical cap or a planar disc, for\nexample, provided \u03a3 is a sphere [18] or a plane [16]. The arguments use the\nholomorphicity of the Hopf differential. Generalizations exist for other ambient\nspaces [2, 21]. See also [14, 19] when we impose conditions on stability.\n\n4\n\nExistence and uniqueness of solutions\n\nFrom Theorem 3.1, we know that a stationary liquid drop resting in a spacelike\nplane \u03a0 and under the effect of a gravitational field Y as linear function\nof the height with respect to \u03a0 must be a surface of revolution. Moreover,\nProposition 2.1 assures that the drop must be a graph over a domain of \u03a0.\nThus the corresponding Euler equation that describes the shape of a stationary\nliquid drop becomes an ordinary differential equation. In this section, we shall\nstudy the problem of existence and uniqueness of such equation.\nWe may assume without loss of generality that the support plane \u03a0 is\nparallel to the plane {x3 = 0} and that the potential energy is Y = \u03ba x3 + \u03bb,\n\u03ba, \u03bb \u2208 R. Let M be a rotational symmetric spacelike graph supported in \u03a0\nwhose mean curvature is Y and that makes a hyperbolic angle \u03b2 with \u03a0 along\n\u2202M . After a horizontal translation, we assume that the axis of revolution is\nthe x3 -axis. Then M is the graph of a function u : [0, R) \u2192 R and it can\nbe represented as M = {r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, u(r)); r \u2208 [0, R), \u03b8 \u2208 R}.

A direct integration of (3) leads to u(r) = \u00b1 r + \u03bb2 + c, if \u03bb 6= 0\nand u(r) = c, if \u03bb = 0. In the first case, u describes a hyperbolic plane of\nmean curvature \u03bb/2; in the second one, we obtain a horizontal plane parallel\nto \u03a0. As conclusion, we have\nProposition 4.1 Let \u03a0 be a support spacelike plane and \u03b2 a real number.\nIf we assume no gravity in the ambient space L3 , then there exists a unique\n13\n\n\fstationary liquid drop resting on \u03a0 and that makes a constant angle \u03b2 of\ncontact along the liquid-solid-air interface. Moreover, one can prescribe the\narea of the wetted region on \u03a0 by the drop.\nProof : Assume \u03a0 = {x3 = c}. If \u03b2 = 0, it suffices to take u(r) = c.

Integrating from 0 to r, we\nobtain\nZ\n1 r\n\u01eb tu(t) dt.\n(10)\nsinh \u03c8(r) =\nr 0\n\u221a\nBecause the function x/ 1 + x2 has Lipschitz constant 1, we have\n|u(r; u0 ) \u2212 u(r; u1 )| \u2264 |u0 \u2212 u1 | +\n\u2264 |u0 \u2212 u1 | +\n\u2264 |u0 \u2212 u1 | +\n\nr\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n| sinh(\u03c81 ) \u2212 sinh(\u03c82 )| dt\n\n0\nr\n\nZ\n\n| tanh(\u03c81 ) \u2212 tanh(\u03c82 )| dt\n\n0\n\n1\nt\n\n\u0012Z\n\nt\n\n0\n\ns|u(s; u0 ) \u2212 u(s; u1 )|ds\n\n\u0013\n\ndt,\n\nwhere in the last inequality we have used (10) and |\u01eb| = 1. By interchanging\nthe order of integration, we obtain\n|u(r; u0 ) \u2212 u(r; u1 )| \u2264 |u0 \u2212 u1 | +\n\nZ\n\nr\n0\n\nr\ns log |u(s; u0 ) \u2212 u(s; u1 )| ds.\ns\n\nSince 0 \u2264 r < b, and by the behaviour of the function x log(b/x), we have\n|u(r; u0 ) \u2212 u(r; u1 )| \u2264 |u0 \u2212 u1 | +\n\nb\ne\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n0\n\n|u(s; u0 ) \u2212 u(s; u1 )| ds.\n\nBy applying the Gronwall's lemma, we obtain\n2 /e\n\n|u(r; u0 ) \u2212 u(r; u1 )| \u2264 |u0 \u2212 u1 |ebr/e \u2264 |u0 \u2212 u1 |eb\n2 /e\n\nBy setting M = eb\n\n.\n\n, we conclude the proof.\nq.e.d\n\nq.e.d\n\nWe study now the existence of (7)-(8). If u0 = 0, the solution is u = 0. We\nassume then u0 6= 0. We can adapt to our situation the method of majorants\nto obtain local existence (if \u01eb = 1, we could consider the method of successive\napproximations as the Euclidean case developed in [13]). The advantage of\nthis proof is that we obtain in addition to the continuity on the parameters.\nSince u(r; u0 ) = \u2212u(r; \u2212u0 ), it suffices to consider u0 > 0.\n15\n\n\fTheorem 4.2 (Existence) Given u0 > 0, there exists a (unique) solution u\nof (7)-(8). The solution u = u(r; u0 ) depends analytically on the parameter u0\nand the maximal interval of definition of u is [0, \u221e).\nProof : We follow the same ideas than\n\u221a in Euclidean space [22] and we only\n\u2032\ndescribe sketch the idea. Put v = u / 1 \u2212 u\u20322 . Equation (7) becomes\n(rv)\u2032 = \u01ebru\nAlso (10) is now\n\nv\u2032 +\n\nor\n\n\u01eb\nv(r) =\nr\n\nZ\n\nv\n= \u01ebu.\nr\n\n(11)\n\nr\n\ntu(t) dt.\n\n(12)\n\n0\n\nBy differentiation of (11), we obtain\n\u0012\n\n(rv \u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 v \u221a\n\n\u01ebr\n1\n+\nr\n1 + v2\n\n\u0013\n\n= 0.\n\n(13)\n\nMoreover (12) yields limr\u21920 (v/r) = \u01ebu0 /2 (also cf. (23) and (46)). Thus\nlimr\u21920 v \u2032 (r) = \u01ebu0 /2. Then (7)-(8) is equivalent to find a solution v of (13)\nwith initial values\nv(0) = 0,\nv \u2032 (0) = \u01ebu0 /2.\nDefine the differential operators\nv\nL(v) = (rv \u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 ,\nr\n\nM (v) =\n\np\n\u01ebrv\n, W = 1 + v2 .\nW\n\nWe write v(r) = n=1 an r n in a potential series, with a1 = \u01ebu0 /2. The radius\nof convergence for M (v) is 1\nP\n\nDefine\nL1 (w) = w\u2032 \u2212\n\n\u01ebu0\n2\n\nM1 (w) = Cr\n\n\u0012\n\nw/\u03c1\n,\n1 + w/\u03c1\n\u0013\n\nfor an appropriate constant C depending on the convergence of M . For a\nP\nfunction w = n=1 bn r n , with w\u2032 (0) = |a1 |, we consider the auxiliary problem\nL1 (w) = M1 (w). One proves then that the series for a solution w of this\nproblem will majorize the series for v with L(v) = M (v). Clearly the initial\nvalue problem\n\u01ebu0\nw/\u03c1\nL1 (w) = w \u2212\n= Cr\n2\n1 + w/\u03c1\n\u0012\n\n\u2032\n\n16\n\n\u0013\n\n= M1 (w)\n\n\fw(0) = 0\ncan be solved by a convergent power series w that majorizes the series for v\nin the circle of convergence. This implies that v is also convergent. Since the\nsolution v writes as an series of potential, the solution u of (7)-(8) is analytic\nin the parameter (r; u0 ).\nFor the study of the maximal interval for a solution u, we transform the\ninitial value problem (7)-(8) into a pair of integral equations\nu(r) = u0 +\n1\nv(r) = \u01eb\nr\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nr\n\nr\n\nv(t)\ndt\n1 + v(t)2\n\np\n\ntu(t) dt.\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\n0\n\nwith u(0) = u0 , v(0) = 0. It is straightforward that if u and v are continuous\nfunctions that satisfy such integral equations, then u\u2032 is continuous and u is a\nsolution of (7)-(8). The integrand in (14) is continuous for any r. This allows\nto extend the solution u(r; u0 ) until \u221e.\nq.e.d.\n\nq.e.d\n\nAs consequence of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, we conclude\nCorollary 4.1 Consider in Lorentz-Minkowsk space L3 a spacelike plane \u03a0\nand a gravity vector field orthogonal to \u03a0. Then any stationary liquid drop of\nL3 supported on \u03a0 can extend to be a graph defined in the whole (x1 , x2 )-plane.\nAlthough in this section we have studied the problem of existence of (7)(8), this allows to solve the problem of existence of the boundary problem\n(3)-(4). This will be proved in Corollaries 5.2 and 7.2).\nWe end this section with a property on the dependence of a solution of the\nstationary liquid drop equation (3) with respect to the capillarity constant \u03ba.\nTheorem 4.3 (Monotony with respect to \u03ba) Let \u03ba1 , and \u03ba2 be two positive constants of capillarity. Denote ui = ui (r), i = 1, 2, two solutions of\n(3)-(4) for \u03ba = \u03bai and where ui (0) > 0. If \u03ba1 < \u03ba2 , then\n1. u1 (r) > u2 (r) for 0 \u2264 r \u2264 R.\n2. u\u20321 (r) > u\u20322 (r) for 0 < r < R.\n17\n\n\fq\n\nProof : After a vertical translation, we assume \u03bb = 0 in (3). Set vi = u\u2032i / 1 \u2212 u\u20322\ni .\n\u2032\nThen (rvi ) = \u03bai rui . For each 0 \u2264 r0 < r < R, we integrate between r = r0\nand r = R:\nZ r\nrvi (r) \u2212 r0 vi (r0 ) = \u03bai\ntui (t) dt.\nr0\n\nThen\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nr v2 (r) \u2212 v1 (r) = r0 v2 (r0 ) \u2212 v1 (r0 ) +\nFor r = R and because u\u20321 (R) = u\u20322 (R),\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nr0 v1 (r0 ) \u2212 v2 (r0 ) =\n\nZ\n\nR\n\nr0\n\nZ\n\nr\n\nr0\n\nt(\u03ba2 u2 (t) \u2212 \u03ba1 u1 (t)) dt.\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nt \u03ba2 u2 (t) \u2212 \u03ba1 u1 (t) dt.\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nIf \u03ba2 u2 (r0 ) \u2265 \u03ba1 u1 (r0 ), then v2 (r0 ) < v1 (r0 ).\nOn the contrary case, that is, if v1 (r0 ) \u2264 v2 (r0 ), then 0 < u\u20321 (r0 ) < u\u20322 (r0 ).\nThe positivity of \u03bai and the fact that \u03ba1 < \u03ba2 implies \u03ba1 u\u20321 (r0 ) < \u03ba2 u\u20322 (r0 ).\nThen \u03ba1 u1 < \u03ba2 u2 in certain interval (r0 , r0 + \u03b4). Let r1 \u2208 (r0 , R] be the\nlargest number where such inequality holds. From (16), for each r0 < s \u2264 r1 ,\nv2 (s) > v1 (s). Thus u\u20322 (s) > u\u20321 (s) and \u03ba2 u\u20322 > \u03ba1 u\u20321 . This implies \u03ba2 u2 > \u03ba1 u1\nfor each r0 < s \u2264 r1 . Since r1 is maximal, then r1 = R. We put now s = R in\n(17) and we obtain a contradiction. This proves the Claim.\nLet us prove now the Theorem and we begin with the item 2. Assume\nthere exists r0 , 0 < r0 < R, such that u\u20321 (r0 ) \u2264 u\u20322 (r0 ). Then v1 (r0 ) \u2264 v2 (r0 ).\nBy the Claim, \u03ba2 u2 (r0 ) < \u03ba1 u1 (r0 ). Then (3) implies (rv2 )\u2032 (r0 ) < (rv1 )\u2032 (r0 ).\nFor certain neighbourhood on the left of r0 , we obtain then\n0 \u2264 r0 (v2 (r0 ) \u2212 v1 (r0 )) < r(v2 (r) \u2212 v1 (r))\nwhich it yields v2 (r) > v1 (r). As v1 (0) = v2 (0) = 0, there exists a last number\nr1 , 0 \u2264 r1 < r0 , such that v2 > v1 in the interval (r1 , r0 ) and v2 (r1 ) = v1 (r1 ) =\n0. The Claim implies now \u03ba2 u2 (r) < \u03ba1 u1 (r), for r1 < r \u2264 r0 . But (17) yields\nv2 (r) < v1 (r) and that is a contradiction. Consequently, u\u20322 < u\u20321 in (0, R).\nLet us prove the item 1. We use again (see the proof of Theorem 4.2)\nlim\n\nr\u21920\n\nui (0)\nvi (r)\n= \u03bai\n.\nr\n2\n\nBecause v1 > v2 , we infer then u2 (0) < u1 (0). As u\u20322 < u\u20321 , an integration\nleads to u2 < u1 in the interval [0, R].\nq.e.d.\n18\n\nq.e.d\n\n\fAs conclusion, we obtain the next inclusion property:\nCorollary 4.2 Let X1 and X2 be two sessile liquid drops in Minkowski space\nL3 supported in the same spacelike plane \u03a0. Assume that the materials of each\nliquid are different. Let \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 be the corresponding constants of capillarity.\nAssume that the angles of contact with \u03a0 are the same. If \u03ba1 < \u03ba2 , then it is\npossible to move X2 by parallel translations to \u03a0 such that X2 lies completely\nincluded in X1 .\nSee Remark 7.2 about what it happens in the case of that the capillarity\nconstant is negative.\n\n5\n\nSessile liquid drops I\n\nThe next two sections are devoted to do a better understanding of the qualitative properties of the shapes that adopt a sessile liquid drop, that is, when the\ncapillary constant \u03ba is positive in the Euler equation (3). In this section we\nask as the behaviour of the profile curve, as well as, the problem of existence\nof sessile liquid drops. We remark in contrast to the Euclidean ambient, that\nby Theorem 4.2 the maximal interval for solutions of (18) is [0, \u221e).\nAfter a vertical translation, we consider equation\n\u0012\n\nru\u2032\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 u\u20322\n\n\u0013\u2032\n\n= \u03ba ru,\n\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 R,\n\n(18)\n\nwith boundary conditions\nu\u2032 (0+ ) = 0\n\nu\u2032 (R\u2212 ) = tanh \u03b2.\n\n(19)\n\nAgain, we study the initial value problem of equation (18) with boundary data\nu(0+ ) = u0 ,\n\nu\u2032 (0+ ) = 0.\n\n(20)\n\nand denote u = u(r; u0 ) to remark the dependence on u0 . If u0 = 0, then\nu = 0, which is the solution associated to (18)-(19) for \u03b2 = 0. Assume then\nu0 6= 0. According to the property u(r; \u2212u0 ) = \u2212u(r; u0 ), we assume u0 > 0.\nPut\n1\nu\u2032\n,\ncosh \u03c8 = \u221a\n,\nsinh \u03c8 = \u221a\n\u20322\n1\u2212u\n1 \u2212 u\u20322\n19\n\n\fwhere \u03c8 is the hyperbolic tha makes u(r) with the horizontal line at each point\n(r, u(r)). Then equation (18) writes as\n(r sinh \u03c8)\u2032 = \u03ba ru\nor equivalently\nsinh \u03c8 =\n\n1\nr\n\nZ\n\n(21)\n\nr\n\n\u03ba tu(t) dt.\n\n(22)\n\n0\n\nAs u0 > 0, the integral in (22) is positive, that is, sinh \u03c8 > 0, and so, u\u2032 (r) > 0\nfor any r > 0. This means that u is strictly increasing in [0, \u221e). Then we\nbound the integrand in (22) by u0 < u(t) < u(r) obtaining\nsinh \u03c8(r)\n\u03bau(r)\n\u03bau0\n<\n<\n.\n2\nr\n2\n\n(23)\n\nIn particular, sinh \u03c8(r) > \u03baru0 /2 \u2192 \u221e as r \u2192 \u221e.

We summarize up the above properties of u.\nTheorem 5.1 Let u be the profile curve for a sessile liquid drop X in Minkowski\nspace L3 . Then\n1. The function u is defined in [0, \u221e).\n20\n\n\f2. u is strictly increasing on r, with limr\u2192\u221e u = \u221e.\n3. u is convex.\n4. limr\u2192\u221e u\u2032 (r; u0 ) = 1.\nFinally, we prove the existence of a sessile liquid drop for prescribed angle\nof contact.\nTheorem 5.2 (Existence of sessile liquid drops) Let L3 be the LorentzMinkowski space. Let \u03ba > 0 be a constant of capillarity, and \u03b2, \u03bb \u2208 R.\n1. Given R > 0, there exists a stationary sessile liquid drop X supported\nin a disc of radius R in some horizontal spacelike plane \u03a0 and such that\n\u03b2 is the contact angle along \u2202(X \u2229 \u03a0). The mean curvature of a point\nx \u2208 X is \u03bax3 (x) + \u03bb.\n2. Consider \u03a0 a spacelike plane. Then there exists a stationary sessile liquid\ndrop X supported on \u03a0 that makes a constant angle \u03b2 along \u2202(X \u2229 \u03a0).\nThe mean curvature of a point x \u2208 X is \u03bax3 (x) + \u03bb, where x3 denotes\nthe distance to \u03a0.\nProof : We know that the surface must be a surface of revolution with respect\nto an axis orthogonal to the plane x3 = 0. After isometries of L3 and a change\nof variables, we assume that \u03b2 \u2265 0 and \u03bb = 0 and that the surface is obtained\nby rotating a function u that is a solution of (18)-(20) with u0 \u2265 0. Moreover,\nin the item 2, we assume that \u03a0 is a horizontal plane.\n1. If \u03b2 = 0, then the solution is u = 0. Then, we assume \u03b2 6= 0. Then\nthe problem reduces to find u0 > 0 such that u\u2032 (R; u0 ) = tanh \u03b2. By\nTheorem 4.2 we have then to study the behaviour of u\u2032 (r; u0 ) with respect\nto u0 . We prove that\nlim u\u2032 (r; u0 ) = 0,\n\nu0 \u21920\n\nlim u\u2032 (r; u0 ) = 1.\n\nu0 \u2192\u221e\n\nBecause u(r; u0 ) is increasing on r,\nv(r; u0 ) =\n\n1\nr\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nr\n\ntu(t) dt \u2265\n\n21\n\n1\nr\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nr\n\ntu0 dt =\n\nu0 r\n\u2212\u2192 \u221e\n2\n\n\fif u0 \u2192 \u221e.

We infer then u\u2032 (r; u0 ) \u2192 0 if u0 \u2192 0 and\nthus\nlim u\u2032 (R; u0 ) = 0\nlim u\u2032 (R; u0 ) = 1.\nu0 \u2192\u221e\n\nu0 \u21920+\n\nBecause u\u2032 (R; u0 ) in continuous at u0 , given \u03b2 \u2208 R and since 0 <\ntanh \u03b2 < 1, there exists a unique solution u(r; u0 ) such that u\u2032 (R; u0 ) =\ntanh \u03b2 as was to be shown.\n2. Suppose \u03a0 \u2261 x3 = c > 0. If \u03b2 = 0, then the function that we seek\nis u(r; c) = c. Assume then \u03b2 > 0. Consider u0 varying from u0 = 0\nto u0 = c. Since u is increasing on r, denote r(u0 ) the unique positive\nnumber such that u(r(u0 ); u0 ) = c and let us study u\u2032 (r(u0 ); u0 ). Since\nu(r; u0 ) \u2192 0 as u0 \u2192 0, we know then that if u0 \u2192 0, then r(u0 ) \u2192 \u221e.\nThus\nlim u\u2032 (r(u0 ); u0 ) = lim u\u2032 (r(u0 ) = 1.\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nu0 \u21920\n\nOn the other hand, if u0 \u2192 c, then r(u0 ) \u2192 0 and then\nlim u\u2032 (r(u0 ); u0 ) = lim u\u2032 (r(u0 ) = 0.\n\nu0 \u2192c\n\nr\u21920\n\nConsequently, there will be a unique u0 such that u\u2032 (r(u0 ); u0 ) = tanh \u03b2\nand u(r(u0 ), u0 ) = c.\nq.e.d\nThis section ends with a result of foliations of the ambient space L3 by\n(entire) sessile liquid drops.\nTheorem 5.3 Fix a positive number \u03ba > 0.

We know that if u0 = 0,\nthen u(r; 0) = 0. Moreover, u(r; \u2212u0 ) = \u2212u(r; u0 ). Thus, it is suffices to show\nthat the plane x2 > 0 is foliated by the solutions of initial value problem for\nu0 > 0. Given (a, b) \u2208 R2 with b > 0, let u = u(r; u0 ) be a solution u of\n(18) such that u(a) < b: this is possible by taking u0 sufficiently near to 0.\nLetting u0 \u2192 \u221e and by the continuity with respect to the parameter u0 , there\nwill be a u0 such that u(a; u0 ) = b. Furthermore, we know that u0 < b. We\nwill prove now that each two solutions u(r; u0 ) and u(r; u1 ) have no points of\nintersections. This is proved in the following\nIf \u03b4 > 0, then u(r; u0 + \u03b4) \u2212 \u03b4 > u(r; u0 ) for 0 < r < \u221e.\nDefine the function u\u03b4 = u(r; u0 + \u03b4), and let \u03c8 \u03b4 be the hyperbolic angle\ngiven by (r sinh \u03c8 \u03b4 )\u2032 = \u03baru\u03b4 .

In addition,\n\n(u\u03b4 (r) \u2212 u(r))\u2032 = tanh \u03c8 \u03b4 (r) \u2212 tanh \u03c8(r) > 0.\nTherefore the function u\u03b4 \u2212 u is strictly increasing on r. So, u\u03b4 (r) \u2212 \u03b4 > u(r).\nLet r0 > \u01eb be the first point where u\u03b4 (r0 ) \u2212 \u03b4 = u(r0 ). Again (26) yields\nsinh \u03c8 \u03b4 (r0 ) \u2212 sinh \u03c8(r0 ) > 0. Then (u\u03b4 \u2212 u)\u2032 (r0 ) \u2264 0. But this implies that\n\u03c8 \u03b4 (r0 ) \u2264 \u03c8(r0 ), which is a contradiction. As conclusion, u\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4 > u in (0, \u221e)\nand this shows the Claim.\nGeometrically the Claim means that we can move u(r; u0 + \u03b4) downwards\nuntil it touches u at the point (0, u0 ) and then, the curve u(r; u0 + \u03b4) lies\ncompletely above u.\nq.e.d.\n\nq.e.d\n\nRemark 5.1 It is worth to point out that in relativity theory there is interest\nof finding real-valued functions on a given spacetime, all of whose level sets\nprovide a global time coordinate.

From (28), km < k2 in some interval\n(0, \u01eb) on the right of r = 0. Because the initial conditions are the same for u\nand y2 , we know that u < y2 in some interval (0, \u01eb). We assert that u < y2\non (0, R]. The next reasoning is similar as in Theorem 4.3. On the contrary\ncase, let r\u0304 < R be the first point such that u(r\u0304) = y2 (r\u0304).

Then for each V > 0\nand \u03b2 \u2208 R, there exists a unique (up isometries) sessile liquid drop X in\nMinkowski space L3 supported in a spacelike plane \u03a0 such that the volume of\nthe drop is V and \u03b2 is the boundary angle of contact between X and \u03a0 along\n\u2202(X \u2229 \u03a0).\nProof : We follow the same ideas than in Euclidean space [7]. We know that\nthe liquid drop is described by a surface of revolution whose profile curve u\nis a solution of Equation (3). Since vertical translations do not change the\nenclosed volume and the contact angle, we can suppose that \u03bb = 0. We may\nassume without loss of generality that \u03b2 and u0 are positive and the drop\ntouches \u03a0 at r = R. Then \u03a0 \u2261 {x3 = uR } and u\u2032 (R) = tanh \u03b2. By using (29),\nthe volume V of the sessile liquid drop determined by u is\nV = \u03c0R2 uR \u2212\n\n2\u03c0R sinh \u03b2\n.\n\u03ba\n\nWe study the behaviour of V according to the variable u0 . Note that as in\nEuclidean ambient, V = V(u0 ) is continously differentiable function on u0 .\nFor the existence, we take limits of V when u0 goes to \u221e and 0. By (23),\n\u03bau0 /2 < sinh \u03b2/R. Thus R = R(u0 ) \u2192 0 if u0 \u2192 \u221e. Because u is increasing\non r, V < \u03c0R2 (uR \u2212u0 ). On the other hand, and since u is convex, the number\nV is less than the volume of the surface of revolution generated by the segment\nof the straight-line that joins the points (0, u0 ) and (R, uR ). Then\nV>\n\n\u03c0 2\nR (uR \u2212 u0 ).\n3\n\nIt follow from (35) that\n\u03c0R2 (uR \u2212 u0 ) < \u03c0R3\n\ncosh \u03b2 \u2212 1\n\u2212\u2192 0,\nsinh \u03b2\n\nas u0 \u2192 \u221e. We consider now the behaviour of V as u0 \u2192 0. We point out\nthat the estimate (41) yields R \u2192 \u221e. By using (35) and (37), we obtain\n\u03c0 2\n\u03c0\n2(cosh \u03b2 \u2212 1)\nR (uR \u2212 u0 ) > R2\n,\n3\n3\n\u03ba\u03b1(R)\nwhere\nsinh \u03b2\n+\n\u03b1(R) =\n\u03baR\n\ns\n\n2\n(cosh \u03b2 \u2212 1) +\n\u03ba\n33\n\n\u0012\n\nsinh \u03b2\n\u03baR\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n\fBut\n\nR2\n= \u221e.\nR\u2192\u221e \u03b1(R)\nlim\n\nThus, for fixed \u03b2, every value V between 0 and \u221e is attained by V and this\nproves the existence.\nThe uniqueness of u is showed in proving that\n*\n\nV=\n\n\u2202V\n< 0.\n\u2202u0\n\nThe proof is similar as in [7] and the details are omitted.\nq.e.d.\n\nq.e.d\n\nSome of the estimates obtained in this section are compared with numerical\ncalculations in Table 6. We compute the height q and volume V for different\nvalues of \u03ba and let us compare with the estimates in (35) and (36) respectively.\nOn the other hand, Table 6contains computed data comparing the value of u\nwith the lower and upper bounds obtained in Theorems 37 and 39.\n\n7\n\nPendent liquid drops\n\nThis last section of the present paper is devoted to the case \u03ba < 0 in the Euler\nequation (3). We assume \u03bb = 0 and we consider solutions of\nd\ndr\n\nru\u2032 (r)\np\n1 \u2212 u\u2032 (r)2\n\n!\n\n= \u03ba ru(r), 0 \u2264 r,\n\nu(0+ ) = u0 ,\n\nu\u2032 (0+ ) = 0.\n\n\u03ba < 0.\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\nThe main fact that we shall show is that a solution u oscillates about\nthe r-axis with successively decreasing extrema. See Figure 2. In contrast to\nthe Euclidean case [6, 23], the spacelike character of our surfaces prohibits the\npresence of vertical points for the function u: recall that u\u2032 = tanh \u03c8 \u2208 (\u22121, 1).\nFrom the theorem of existence and uniqueness, we know that (42)-(43) has\na unique solution for any initial data. In addition, the function u is defined\nfor any r (we emphasize that this is a difference with the Euclidean case). If\nwe denote by u = u(r; u0 ) the dependence on the initial value u0 , we have\nu(r; \u2212u0 ) = \u2212u(r; u0 ). Without loss of generality, we assume u0 \u2264 0.For\nu0 = 0, the solution is u = 0.

Therefore, ro < R and u(ro ) = 0. This\nmeans that ro is the first zero of u and that the function u increases until a\nvalue R where R > ro . Let us see now that there will be a first time where u\nattains a maximum, and next, u decreases.\nLemma 7.3 In the above conditions, let ra < rb be two numbers such that\nu(ra ) < 0 < u(rb ) and |u(ra )| = u(rb ). Then u\u2032 (rb ) < u\u2032 (ra ). Furthermore, in\nthe interval [0, R] u is concave provided u > 0.\nProof : We integrate the expression (45) from u = u(ra ) to u = u(rb ) obtaining\ncosh \u03c8(rb )\u2212cosh \u03c8(ra ) = \u03ba\n\nu(rb )2 \u2212 u(ra )2\n\u2212\n2\n38\n\nZ\n\nub\n\nua\n\nsinh \u03c8\ndu = \u2212\nr\n\nZ\n\nub\n\nua\n\nsinh \u03c8\ndu < 0.\nr\n\n\fBecause \u03c8 > 0, this implies \u03c8b < \u03c8a and so,\nu\u2032 (rb ) = tanh(\u03c8(rb )) < tanh(\u03c8(ra )) = u\u2032 (ra ).\nSuppose now that u > 0.

Thus\nthe function u is strictly increasing in the interval (0, rM ), across the r-axis\nin some point ro and it continues until a strict local maximum r = rM , where\nthe function u attains a height uM , with uM < |u0 |. Moreover, in the interval\n[ro , rM ] the function u is concave and no inflection points exist in [ro , rM ].\nIt can be precised the difference value between uM and u0 with the following\nLemma 7.4 Let u be a solution of (42)-(43).

We omit the\ndetails of the proof.\nProposition 7.2 Let u be a solution of (42)-(43). Then we have the following:\n1. Let rM and rm be two values of r where u attains two consecutive extrema. If ro denotes the unique zero of u in (rM , rm ), then\nu2m <\n\n2\nro2 + rM\nu2M .\n2ro2\n\n40\n\n\f2. Let rm and rM be two values of r where u attains two consecutive extremal points. If ro denotes the unique zero of u in (rm , rM ), then\nu2M <\n\n2\nro2 + rm\nu2m .\n2ro2\n\nAs conclusion of the above results, the values of u in these extrema goes\ndecreasing to zero as r goes to infinity, and the same occurs for the function\nu. We summarize the results obtained as follows:\nTheorem 7.1 Let u be a solution of (42)-(43). Then there holds the following:\n1. The function u has an infinity of zeros.\n2. The function u goes to 0 as r \u2192 \u221e.\n3. Between two successive extrema occurs exactly one inflection point. These\npoints lie in the interval between a minimum and the following zero of\nu, and between a maximum and the following zero of u.\nProof : We have only to show the item 3. Since the reasoning repeats in each\ninterval of two successive extrema of u, we do it only in the first interval\n[0, rM ]. Consider ro the first zero of u. It follows from Lemma 7.3 that u\u2032\u2032 < 0\nin [ro , rM ]. So that we \u221a\nhave to show that there exists exactly one inflection in\n\u2032\n(0, ro ). Denote v = u / 1 \u2212 u\u20322 as in Theorem 4.2. We know that\nv\u2032 +\n\nv\n= \u03bau,\nr\n\nv(0) = 0, v \u2032 (0) = \u2212u0 /2.\n\nThis means that v is increasing on the right of r = 0. Since v(rM ) = 0,\nthere exists one local maximum of v in (0, rM ), that is, a point of inflection.\nLet r1 < ro the first maximum of v, and so, an inflection point. In the next\ninflection r = r2 , r2 < ro , we know that v \u2032 (r2 ) = 0 and v \u2032\u2032 (r2 ) \u2265 0. However,\nas v \u2032 (r2 ) = 0, then (cf. Eq. (11))\nv(r2 )\n= \u03bau(r2 ) > 0.\nr2\nSince v \u2032\u2032 + (v/r)\u2032 = \u03bau\u2032 , then at the point r = r2 we have\n\u2032\n\n\u03bau (r2 ) \u2265\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u2032\n\nv\nr\n\n41\n\n(r2 ) = 0,\n\n\fwhich is a contradiction since u\u2032 > 0 in (0, rM ). In particular, the (infinite)\nset of inflection points of u is isolated, and thus, this set as well as the set of\nthe zeroes of u is not bounded.\nq.e.d.\n\nq.e.d\n\nOur original problem of the existence of pendent liquid drops can be solved.\nWe consider that the radius and the angle of contact, or the support plane\nand the angle of contact are prescribed. The study is concentrated in pendent\nliquid drops physically realizable, that is, drops that lie in one side of the\nsupport plane. For the proof we need the following\nLemma 7.5 Consider u a solution of (42)-(43) and denote ro the first zero\nof u.

Let \u03ba < 0 be a constant of capillarity, and \u03b2, \u03bb \u2208 R.\n1. Given R > 0, there exists a stationary pendent liquid drop X supported\nin a disc of radius R > 0 in some horizontal spacelike plane \u03a0 and such\nthat \u03b2 is the contact angle along \u2202(X \u2229 \u03a0). The mean curvature of a\npoint x \u2208 X is \u03bax3 (x) + \u03bb.

Consider \u03a0 a spacelike plane. Then there exists a stationary pendent\nliquid drop X supported on \u03a0 that makes a constant angle \u03b2 along \u2202(X \u2229\n\u03a0). The mean curvature of a point x \u2208 X is \u03bax3 (x)+\u03bb, where x3 denotes\nthe distance to \u03a0. The drop lies in one side of \u03a0.\nProof : We may assume without loss of generality that \u03bb = 0 and that in the\nitem 2, the plane \u03a0 is horizontal. We know that the solution is obtained by\nrotating a solution u of (42)-(43) by an appropriate choice of u0 . Moreover,\nwe can suppose that \u03b2 \u2265 0 and u0 \u2264 0.\n1. If \u03b2 = 0, the solution is u = 0. Let \u03b2 > 0. We will seek a solution\nq u such\n\u2032\nthat u (R) = tanh \u03b2. Take u0 sufficiently big so that R < u20 \u2212 4/\u03ba.\nWe know that the hyperbolic cap y4 satisfies y4 > u. Furthermore,\nu(t) < y4 (t) < 0 for t \u2208 [0, R].

Now, we take u0 \u2192 0. Since u(r; u0 ) \u2192 0 if u0 \u2192 0,\n43\n\n\fthe continuity on the parameter u0 leads to the existence of a number\nu0 such that u\u2032 (R; u0 ) = tanh \u03b2.\n2. Suppose \u03a0 \u2261 x3 = 0. If \u03b2 = 0, the solution is u = 0. Let \u03b2 > 0. Denote\nro (u0 ) the first zero of u and let us study u\u2032 (ro ; u0 ) for each solution\nu = u(r; u0 ) where u0 varies from \u2212\u221e until 0. By the continuity of the\nsolutions with respect to the parameter u0 and by Lemma 7.5\nlim ro (u0 ) = 0,\n\nlim ro (u0 ) = \u221e.\n\nu0 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nu0 \u21920\n\nFurthermore, and since the hyperbolic plane y4 lies over u, we have from\n(45)\nZ\nZ\n\u03ba ro\n\u03ba so\nsinh \u03c8(ro ) =\ntu(t) dt >\nty4 (t) dt \u2192 \u221e,\nro 0\nso 0\n\nwhere so is the (unique) zero of y4 with the r-axis. Thus u\u2032 (ro ; u0 ) varies\nfrom 0 to 1 as u0 goes from to 0 to \u2212\u221e.\nq.e.d.\n\nq.e.d\n\nAlso we have a control of the first maximum uM of u with its dependence\non u0 .\nCorollary 7.1 Let uM = uM (u0 ) be the first maximum of u = u(r; u0 ), where\nu is a solution of (42)-(43), with u0 < 0.

The same occurs for 0 \u2264 r \u2264 R since\nboth y4 and u are increasing in the interval [0, R]. Because both y4 and u\nagree at r = 0, then |y4 (R; u0 ) \u2212 u(R; u0 )| \u2192 0 as u0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.

In\ngeneral, the volume of a pendent liquid drop supported on a spacelike plane\n\u03a0 is given as follows. Without loss of generality, we assume \u03a0 is parallel to\nx3 = 0 and that \u03bb = 0 in (3). Thus the drop is obtained by a profile curve u\nthat is solution of (42)-(43). Let r > 0 and \u03c8 the hyperbolic angle of contact\n45\n\n\fbetween the graph of u and the plane \u03a0 \u2261 {x3 = u(r)}. We consider the\nportion of u between r = 0 and r = rM , where rM is the first maximum of u.\nDenote by V = V(r) the volume of the drop determined by u in the interval\n[0, r]. Setting ro the first zero of u, we have\n1. If r \u2264 ro , then\n\nV(r) = \u2212\n\n2\u03c0r sinh \u03c8\n\u03ba\n\n(50)\n\n2.

This has\na physical significance since any drop that extends beyond the coordinate rM\nwould have to pass through again the supporting plane, which is physically\nunrealistic. See Figure 4. We are going to estimate a lower bound for VM .\n2 u .\nFor u, we know that VM = \u03c0rM\nM\nOn the other hand, the function y4 lies above u and this gives an estimate\nfor V. The function y4 attains the value uM at\nr1 =\n\ns\n\nq2 +\n\n4\nq,\n\u03bau0\n\nwhere q = uM \u2212 u0 is the height of the liquid drop. Then the volume VM of \u03a34\nin the interval [0, r1 ] is less than VM . In the same way, the volume V0 determined by u with the r-axis can be estimated by below by the corresponding\nvolume V0 of y4 . The values of the volume of \u03a34 until the r axis and until\ny4 = uM are respectively\nV0 =\n\n\u03c0u0\n(6 \u2212 \u03bau20 ),\n3\u03ba\n\nVM =\n\n\u03c0 2\nq (6 + \u03bau0 q).\n3\u03bau0\n\nCorollary 7.3 Let u = u(r; u0 ) be a solution of (42)-(43).

Moreover, the\ndrop is asymptotic to a hyperbolic cap.\nWe compare with Euclidean ambient: in Euclidean 3-space R3 , consider a\nsmall pendent liquid drop supported in a plane. When we add more a more\nliquid in the drop, there exists a time where the drop turns into a state of\ninstability in such way that the drop falls down. In contrast to this, the above\nCorollary roughly says that in Lorentz-Minkowski space, we can increase the\namount of liquid in the pendent drop so that the drop increases its size, but\nthe drop will never fall down. In the same way, the height of the maximum\ndrop increases monotonically with volume as well as the area of contact with\nthe horizontal plate.\nCorollary 7.5 Let u be a solution of (42)-(43). Denote ro and rM the first\nzero and maximum of u.

Then for each V > 0\nand \u03b2 \u2208 R, there exists a stationary pendent liquid drop X in Minkowski space\nL3 supported in a spacelike plane \u03a0 such that the volume of the drop is V and\n\u03b2 is the boundary angle of contact between X and \u03a0 along \u2202(X \u2229 \u03a0). This\npendent liquid drop lies in one side of \u03a0.\nProof : Without loss of generality, we suppose that \u03b2 > 0 and that the drop\nX is defined by a solution u of (42)-(43) for u0 < 0. Let R be the real number\nsuch that\n2\u03c0R sinh \u03b2\n.\nV =\u2212\n\u03ba\n\u221a\nIf R < Ro := 2/ \u2212\u03ba, we consider the solution u(r; u0 ) such that the pendent\ndrop that defines is supported in a horizontal plane \u03a0 where R is the radius\n47\n\n\fof the disc that the drop wets on \u03a0 and \u03b2 is the angle of contact. By Lemma\n7.5, R lies on the left of the first zero ro of u. As a consequence, the volume\nV of the drop is exactly V by (50). Thus, V takes all values in the interval\n[0, \u2212 2\u03c0Ro\u03basinh \u03b2 ].\n\n\u03b2\nConsider now V > \u2212 2\u03c0R0\u03basinh \u03b2 and let r be such that V = \u2212 2\u03c0r sinh\nand\n\u03ba\n\u2032\nthe corresponding solution u = u(r; u0 ) of (42)-(43) with u (r) = tanh \u03b2. If\nr < ro , ro the first zero of u, then we obtain V = V again. On the contrary\ncase, by (51),\n\nV(r; u0 ) = \u03c0r 2 u(r, u0 ) + V = \u03c0r 2 u(r) \u2212\n\n2\u03c0r sinh \u03b2\n2\u03c0Ro sinh \u03b2\n>\u2212\n.\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\nNow, we solve (42)-(43) with u\u2032 (r) = tanh \u03b2 and r \u0581 R0 . By the continuity\nof V with respect to (r; u0 ) and since\n2\nV(r; u0 ) \u2264 \u03c0rM\nuM = VM \u2212\u2192 0\n\nas u0 \u2192 0, V(r; u0 ) takes any value until to arrive to 0.\nq.e.d\n\nq.e.d\n\nRemark 7.1 In Theorems 7.3 and 7.2, we found a qualitative difference with\nthe Euclidean case. Remember that in Euclidean space, for a given constant of\ncapillarity, there exists a universal finite upper bound for the physical diameter\nfor all possible pendent drops [6]. However, in Lorentzian setting, the existence\nof pendent liquid drops when a volume and an angle of contact or when a disc\nof wetting and an angle of contact are prescribed is assured for any arbitrary\nvolume or disc. Furthermore, the solutions correspond with a physical realistic\npendent drop in the sense that the drop lies in one side of the supporting plane\n\u03a0 and do not across \u03a0 beyond the liquid-air-solid interface.\nRemark 7.2 For pendent liquid drops we have not a result of monotonicity\nwith respect to the constant of capillarity, as in Theorem 4.3, even in the case\nthat we only consider the profile curve until its first maximum. For example,\nif we take pendent drops until rM , then the contact angle is 0, but the profiles\ndo not present a monotony of shapes.\nHowever, we have a similar inclusion property as in the Claim of Theorem\n5.3. Consider u = u(r; u0 ) the solution of (42)-(43) with u0 < 0. Denote\nrM (u0 ) the first maximum of u. Let \u03b4 > 0. Then u(r; u0 \u2212 \u03b4) > u(r; u0 ) \u2212 \u03b4\nfor each r \u2208 (0, rM ].\n48\n\n\fFigure 4: Maximum pendent liquid drop. Here \u03ba = \u22122, u0 = \u22121.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. D.
