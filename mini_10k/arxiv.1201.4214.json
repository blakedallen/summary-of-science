I NTRODUCTION\nCognitive radio has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate the spectrum shortage problem and\nimprove spectrum efficiency. It has received tremendous research attentions recently [1]\u2013[6]. In a cognitive\nradio network, opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) is used, in which the unlicensed users, referred to as\nsecondary users, search for spectrum holes through sensing, and utilize the observed spectrum opportunities for their data transmission. Optimal OSA when the secondary users have statistical information of\nlicensed users (referred to as primary users), such as information of free probabilities of primary channels,\nhas been addressed in [7]\u2013[11], to maximize transmission capacity, optimize transmission power efficiency,\netc. However, research on the optimal OSA without a priori statistical knowledge of primary channels\nis still in its infancy. The research challenge is how to achieve the optimal tradeoff between channel\nexploration (the process to sense the channels so as to learn the statistical information) and channel\nexploitation (the process to utilize observed channel opportunities). If statistical information of primary\nchannels is known in advance, a secondary user can select the optimal channels to sense and subsequently\naccess sensed-free channels. However, without such information, a learning process is needed, and the\nsecondary user should also explore suboptimal channels through sensing to learn statistical information\nof those channels. Therefore, learning loss is expected, compared to the case that the secondary user\nalways selects the optimal channels. In the literature, the channel sensing and access process has been\nCorrespondence author: Dr. Hai Jiang, Dept. of ECE, University of Alberta, Canada. Email: hai1@ualberta.ca.\n\n\fmodeled as a multi-armed bandit problem (MABP) [12]. For an MABP, the loss due to learning until time\ninstant t is represented by the regret R(t), the difference between the actual reward of an arm-selection\nrule and the reward of a genie-aided rule that has known statistical information of the arms [13]. It is\nproved in [14] that for any adaptive allocation rule1 the regret is at least \u03bc ln t when t \u2192 \u221e, where the\n\nfactor \u03bc is determined by the statistical information of arms. A rule that achieves the lower bound of \u03bc\nis called efficiently optimal, and a rule with regret O(ln t) is called order optimal. For OSA in cognitive\nradio networks, reference [12] derives order optimal rules to well coordinate the balance between channel\nexploration and exploitation, with the assumption of perfect channel sensing. Although not efficiently\noptimal, the rules are sample mean based index rules [15], and their implementation is much simpler\nthan the efficiently optimal rules given in [14]. Moreover, a regret bound is also observed with finite t\n\n2\n\nin rules in [12], while no such bound is observed for finite t in the efficiently optimal rules in [14]. A\ndistributed cognitive sensing problem is investigated and formulated as an adversary bandit problem in\n[16], where no statistical assumption is made on channel states. Multi-user OSA in distributed manner is\ninvestigated in [17], modeled as an MABP with multiple players. In the above existing research efforts\nfor OSA in cognitive radio, perfect channel sensing is assumed, and each secondary user can utilize all\nobserved spectrum opportunities (i.e., infinitely backlogged traffic is assumed at the secondary user).\nUnlike existing research efforts, this work explores OSA when i) imperfect channel sensing is assumed\nand ii) a secondary user has only limited \"access demand\" (i.e., it may not use all observed spectrum\nopportunities at a time period). Our motivation for i) is that channel sensing is always imperfect in a\nreal network. And our motivation for ii) is that a user may have only limited traffic to send at a time\nperiod (for example, for a voice conversation).3 Similar setup with limited access demand is adopted\nin [18]\u2013[20]. Therefore, unlike existing OSA research where there is only one decision (i.e., to decide\nwhich channels to sense, and subsequently access all sensed-free channels), we have two decisions in\nthe OSA in our work: to decide which channels to sense; and if a number of channels are sensed free,\nto decide which channels to access. Two cases are considered in our work:\n\u2022\n\nCase I: when a secondary user can sense all potential channels simultaneously, referred to as full\nchannel sensing;\n\n\u2022\n\nCase II: when a secondary user can sense a subset of the potential channels simultaneously, referred\nto as partial channel sensing.\n\nCase I is investigate in Section II, in which we derive OSA rules and theoretically prove that they have\nasymptotically finite regrets. Case II is investigated in Section III, in which we derive OSA rules and\n1\n\nThis means the decisions of the rule are only based on observations in the history [14].\n\n2\n\nIn this paper, when we say \"finite t\", it means sufficiently large and finite t.\n\n3\n\nActually the case when a secondary user has unlimited access demand can be viewed as a special case of our work.\n\n2\n\n\ftheoretically prove that they have regrets O(ln t) with t \u2192 \u221e and with finite t. Performance evaluation\nof the derived OSA rules is given in Section IV, followed by conclusion remarks in Section V.\nII. C ASE I:\n\nWITH\n\nF ULL C HANNEL S ENSING\n\nConsider a slotted system, where time is partitioned into slots, and the duration of each slot is T . For\na secondary user, there are N potential primary channels, denoted as Channels 1, 2, ..., N , respectively.\nIn each slot, Channel i (i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N }) is free (i.e., without primary activities) with probability \u03b8i , and\n\n\u03b8i is unknown by the secondary user. Let Si (j) = 1 and Si (j) = 0 denote Channel i is free and busy,\n\nrespectively, at Slot j . For each channel, the channel states (busy or free) vary independently from a slot\nto another. And the N channels have independent channel states.\nEach slot consists of a sensing period with duration \u03c4 and data transmission period with duration T \u2212\u03c4 .\n\nFor each slot, during the sensing period the secondary user senses all the N channels. Among all the\nsensed-free channels, the secondary user can access (i.e., transmit its data over) up to K channels in the\ndata transmission period. For each accessed channel, the transmission rate is denoted B .\nDuring the sensing in Slot j , denote X(j) = (X1 (j), X2 (j), ..., XN (j)) as the sensing result of the N\n\nchannels, where Xi (j) = 1 and Xi (j) = 0 mean Channel i is sensed to be free and busy, respectively.\nSince sensing errors are inevitable, we let Pdi denote the detection probability of Channel i (i.e., the\nprobability of detecting the primary user activity if there is primary user activity), and Pfi denote the\nfalse-alarm probability of Channel i (i.e., the probability of mistakenly estimating that the primary user\nis active when there is actually no primary user activity).\nSince the secondary user senses all the N channels, the only decision of the secondary user to make is\non which channel(s) to access based on its sensing result. To protect primary users, only channels sensed\n\u25b3\n\nfree can be accessed. Since primary users' statistical information \u0398 = (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , ..., \u03b8N ) is unknown, online\nlearning is needed for the secondary user to estimate \u0398. In the following, we first investigate the situation\nof single channel access (i.e., K = 1, the secondary user can or need to access only one channel at a\nslot), and subsequently extend the research result to the situation of multiple channel access (i.e., K \u2265 2,\nthe secondary user can or need to access more than one channel simultaneously at a slot).\nA. Single Channel Access at a Slot (K = 1)\nTo evaluate the performance of a channel access rule, we use the performance of a genie-aided rule (in\nwhich the channel statistical information \u0398 is known) as a benchmark for comparison. Until Slot t, the\nexpected reward, defined as the total\n\u0014 number of bits transmitted\n\u0015 by the secondary user, of the genie-aided\nt\nP\nrule is given as\nB(T \u2212 \u03c4 )E max E [Si (j)|Xi (j) = 1] , where I(j) denotes the set of channels\nj=1\n\ni\u2208I(j)\n\nsensed free at Slot j , and E[*] denotes expectation. In the reward expression, the outer expectation is for\nI(j), and the inner expectation is for Si (j).\n\n3\n\n\fFor any adaptive allocation rule denoted \u03c8 , where \u03c8(j) = i means Channel i is decided to be accessed\nt\nN\nP\nP\nat Slot j , the expected reward until Slot t is\nB(T \u2212 \u03c4 ) (1 \u2212 Pfi )\u03b8i Prob(\u03c8(j) = i), where Prob(*)\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nmeans probability of an event.\n\nThe regret (also the learning loss) of rule \u03c8 until Slot t, defined as the difference between the expected\nrewards of \u03c8 and the genie-aided rule, is given as\n\u0014\n\u0015 X\nN\nt\nt\nX\nX\n(1\u2212Pfi )\u03b8i Prob(\u03c8(j) = i).

For an MABP, it is extremely\nhard to derive an optimal channel access strategy such that the regret is minimized. Therefore, researchers\ninstead focus on regret bound in asymptotic sense. For example, in [12], asymptotically order optimal\nrules are derived such that the regret is O(ln t) when t \u2192 \u221e. In our research, we also focus on channel\naccess rule with good asymptotic performance such as asymptotically finite regret. Note that for twoarmed bandit problem with side observation, reference [21] gives a rule with asymptotically finite regret\nunder direct information setting. In our work, we derive a rule with asymptotically finite regret for our\nmulti-armed bandit problem with side observation, as follows.\nFor sensing of the N channels, we have 2N possible combinations of the sensing result. Denote U as\n\nthe set of the 2N possible combinations. For each u \u2208 U , at each slot (say Slot t) we keep a record of\n\nLu , which denotes the rate of u as the sensing result, given as the ratio of the number of slots in which\n\u2020\n\nu is the sensing result to t. Also define Pu\u0398 as the probability that u is the sensing result at a slot,\n\nwhich is numerically calculated assuming that \u0398\u2020 is the vector of free probabilities of the N channels.\nOur proposed channel access rule is shown in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Single Channel Access with Full Channel Sensing at Slot t\n1: Sense N channels, obtain sensing result X(t), and update Lu , u \u2208 U .\n2: Construct candidate set C(t) of the form\n\uf8f1\nsX\nsX\n\uf8f2\n\u2020\n\u2032\nC(t) = \u0398\u2020 :\n(Pu\u0398 \u2212 Lu )2 \u2264 inf\n(Pu\u0398 \u2212 Lu )2 +\n\uf8f3\n\u0398\u2032 \u2208(0,1]N\nu\u2208U\n\n3:\n\n4:\n5:\n6:\n7:\n\nu\u2208U\n\n\uf8fc\n1\uf8fd\nt\uf8fe\n\n.\n\nArbitrarily pick up \u0398\u0302 \u2208 C(t), and calculate conditionally expected reward B(T \u2212\n\u03c4 )E [Si (t)|Xi (t) = 1] (i \u2208 I(t)) by using \u0398\u0302 as the vector of channel free probabilities.

It can be proved that the resulted algorithms have\nasymptotically finite regret. The proofs are similar to those of Theorems 1 and 2, and are omitted here.\nIII. C ASE II:\n\nWITH\n\nPARTIAL C HANNEL S ENSING\n\nStill consider N channels. At a slot, the secondary user can sense M (< N ) of them and can access\nup to K(\u2264 M ) channels among the sensed-free channels. Therefore, we have a bi-level MABP: the first\nlevel is to decide which M channels to sense; and the second level is to decide, among the sensed-free\nchannels, which up to K channels to access. The arms played in the two levels are different, which makes\nthe problem much more challenging than classical MABP. To the best of our knowledge, a general bilevel MABP is still an open problem. In the following, we provide solutions to our particular bi-level\nMABP. Possible extension of our solutions to a more general bi-level MABP is to be investigated in our\nfuture work.\nUnlike Case I where we have common channel access rules for homogeneous sensing (i.e., Pdi = Pd ,\nPfi = Pf , \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N }) and heterogeneous sensing (i.e., for each channel, say Channel i, we have\n\ndistinct setting {Pdi , Pfi }), the homogeneous sensing and heterogeneous sensing need to be treated in\ndifferent ways in Case II, as discussed in Section III-A and III-B, respectively.\nA. Homogeneous Sensing\nConsider Pdi = Pd , Pfi = Pf , \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N }. Without loss of generality, we assume \u03b81 > \u03b82 >\n\n... > \u03b8N .\n\nWe still use the performance of a genie-aided rule as a benchmark for comparison. It can be proved that\nthe genie-aided rule should always sense M\u2217\"= {1, 2, ..., M }. So until Slot t, the expected reward of the\n#\nt\nP\nP\n\u2217\nE [Si (j)|Xi (j) = 1]\ngenie-aided rule is given as U (t) =\nE B(T \u2212 \u03c4 )\nmax\nK(j)\u2282IM\u2217 (j),|K(j)|\u2264K i\u2208K(j)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere IM\u2217 (j) denotes the set of sensed-free channels at Slot j if the channels in M\u2217 are sensed, and\n\nK(j) denotes the set of channels to access at Slot j .\n\nIn the following, we investigate single channel access (K = 1) and multiple channel access (K > 1),\n\nrespectively.\n1) Single Channel Access at a slot (K = 1): The expected reward of the genie-aided rule until Slot\nt is:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nt\nX\nU \u2217 (t) =\n\nj=1\n\nE B(T \u2212 \u03c4 )\n\nmax E [Si (j)|Xi (j) = 1] .\n\ni\u2208IM\u2217 (j)\n\n6\n\n(2)\n\n\fCompared with the genie-aided rule, regret of a single channel access rule \u03c6, in which \u03c6(j) denotes the\nchannel to be accessed at Slot j , is given as\n\u2217\n\nR(t, \u03c6) = U (t) \u2212\n\nt\nX\nj=1\n\nB(T \u2212 \u03c4 )\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n(1 \u2212 Pfi )\u03b8i Prob(\u03c6(j) = i).\n\n(3)\n\nUnlike Case I in Section II, we cannot expect asymptotically finite regret R(t). The reason is as\nfollows. For partial channel sensing, consider a perfect scenario in which all sensed-free channels are\nto be accessed and all sensings are perfect. It is shown in Theorem 3.1 in [14] and Lemma 2 in [12]\nthat the perfect scenario has a lower bound of O(ln t) on R(t) as t \u2192 \u221e. It can be proved (the proof is\n\nomitted due to space limit) that, if the perfect scenario has regret C ln t where C is a constant, then our\nresearch problem has regret at least D ln t where D is a constant.\nNote that references [14] and [15] give rules with regret O(ln t) when t \u2192 \u221e. However, performance\n\nof the rules with finite t is still unclear. In the following, using the UCB1 (here UCB stands for Upper\nConfidence Bound) in [22], we derive a channel sensing and access rule that has regret R(t) \u223c O(ln t)\n\nwith t \u2192 \u221e and with finite t. Note that the original UCB1 cannot be directly applied to our research\n\nproblem, because, if it is directly applied, there is only one decision, i.e., which channels to sense at a\nslot. Since in our research problem there are two decisions (which channels to sense, and which channel\nto access among the sensed-free channels), we have necessary extensions to the original UCB1.\nAt each slot (say Slot t), the secondary user keeps records T(t) = (T1 (t), T2 (t), ..., TN (t)) and Y(t) =\n(Y1 (t), Y2 (t), ..., YN (t)), where Ti (t) is the number of slots in which Channel i has been sensed until\n\nSlot t, and Yi is the number of slots in which Channel i has been sensed free until Slot t. The proposed\nchannel sensing and access rule is given in Algorithm 3.\nAlgorithm 3 Single Channel Access with Homogeneous Sensing in Case II (Partial Channel Sensing)\n\u0006N \u0007\n1: Sense all N channels by using M\nslots (where \u2308*\u2309 is a ceiling function).

Heterogenous Sensing\n\no\nn\nConsider that Channel i (i = 1, ..., N ) has distinct setting Pdi , Pfi . The genie-aided rule with known\n\nchannel statistics \u0398 is still used as a benchmark of performance.\n\nWhen channel statistics \u0398 is unknown, it is desired to find a rule of good performance on regret R(t)\nunder heterogenous sensing. Then a question is raised: can we find a similar rule to those in Section\nIII-A, with R(t) \u223c O(ln t) for finite t and for t \u2192 \u221e? To answer this question, we first look into the\ninsights in the rules in Section III-A.\nAs aforementioned, in Case II (partial channel sensing), there are two levels of MABP : the first level\nis to select which channels to sense, i.e., to select channel set M to maximize\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX\nE [Si (j)|Xi (j) = 1]\uf8fb\nmax\nE \uf8f0B(T \u2212 \u03c4 )\nK(j)\u2282IM (j),|K(j)|\u2264K\n\ni\u2208K(j)\n\nwhile the second level is to select which channels to access, i.e., to select sensed-free channels with\nthe largest E [Si (j)|Xi (j) = 1]. With homogeneous sensing, the criterion in the first level is simplified\n\nto finding the M channels with M largest \u03b8i 's, while the criterion in the second level is simplified to,\namong sensed-free channels, finding up to K channels with the largest \u03b8i 's. Therefore, in Algorithm 3,\nin both levels we use sample mean of sensing results of each channel, which can be used to estimate\n\u03b8i . On the other hand, with heterogeneous sensing, the criteria in the two levels cannot be simplified to\n\nfinding channels with the largest \u03b8i 's. Therefore, it is not feasible to use sample mean of sensing results\nas Algorithm 3 does. Rather, we need samples to reflect reward of each arm in each level, as shown in\nthe following.\n1) Single Channel Access at a Slot (K = 1): Since the secondary user can sense M channels at a slot,\n\u0001\nN\nthe secondary user can sense one from M\npossible sets of M channels, denoted M1 , M2 , ..., M( N ) . In\nM\nN\u0001\nset Mi (i = 1, 2, ..., M ), let mi,j (j = 1, 2, ..., M ) denote the j th channel in Mi . If the secondary user\n\nsenses set Mi at Slot t, let IMi (t) represent the sensing result, which is the set of sensed-free channels.\n\nUntil Slot t, let Ti (t) denote the number of time slots in which Mi is sensed, and Yi (t) denote the\n\ncumulative reward of the slots in which Mi is sensed. Until Slot t, let Ti,j (t) (j = 1, 2, ..., M ) denote\nthe number of slots in which Mi is sensed and subsequently Channel mi,j is accessed, and Yi,j (t)\n\ndenote the cumulative reward of Channel mi,j in time slots in which Mi is sensed and subsequently\n8\n\n\fChannel mi,j is accessed. Note that when we say \"reward\", it means the secondary user transmits over a\nchannel, and receives ACK for the transmission. If no ACK is received, the reward of the corresponding\ntransmission is 0. The proposed channel sensing and access rule is given in Algorithm 4. The secondary\nuser keeps records of Ti (t), Yi (t), Ti,j (t), and Yi,j (t). In the sequel, for simplicity of presentation, the\nindex (t) may be omitted for Ti (t), Yi (t), Ti,j (t), and Yi,j (t).\nAlgorithm 4 Single Channel Access with Heterogeneous Sensing in Case II (Partial Channel Sensing)\nN\u0001\n1: for i = 1 : M do\n2:\nKeep sensing Mi in continuous slots, and at each slot access one free channel that was not accessed\nbefore when Mi is sensed.

Similarly, it can be proved that the\n\nregret of the resulted rule is O(ln t) with finite t and with t \u2192 \u221e.\nIV. P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION\nWe use Monte-Carlo simulation to validate our analysis. Consider a cognitive radio network with\nN = 8 primary channels whose free probabilities are given as 0.9, 0.8, 0.657, 0.564, 0.5, 0.456, 0.404, 0.34\n\nfor the 8 channels in our simulation. For homogenous sensing we have Pd = 0.8 and Pf = 0.3,\nwhile in heterogenous sensing we have (Pd1 , Pd2 , ..., Pd8 ) = (0.8, 0.8, 0.7, 0.75, 0.9, 0.67, 0.85, 0.8), and\n(Pf1 , Pf2 , ..., Pf8 ) = (0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.25, 0.36, 0.15, 0.32, 0.3). We also normalize B(T \u2212 \u03c4 ) = 1.\n\nCase I with full channel sensing is evaluated first. Figs. 1 and 2 show the average regret of Algorithm\n1 with homogeneous sensing and heterogeneous sensing, respectively, while Figs. 3 and 4 show the\n9\n\n\faverage regret of Algorithm 2 with homogeneous sensing and heterogeneous sensing, respectively. From\nthe figures it can be seen that when t is large, R(t) tends to be finitely bounded, which is consistent\nwith our analysis in Section II. Note that, due to complexity of Algorithm 1, Figs. 1 and 2 are average\nover only 100 simulation runs, and thus, the regret R(t) does not always increase in the two figures.\nInterestingly, in Figs. 3 and 4, the R(t) increases when K changes from 1 to 3, and R(t) decreases when\nK further changes to 5 and 7. This can be explained as follows. When K = 1, the false access (i.e.,\n\nthe proposed rule does not access the same channel as the genie-aided rule does) is only on one single\nchannel. When K changes to 3, the false access is on up to 3 channels, and thus, the reward loss is\nlikely to be larger than that with K = 1. When K further increases, the up to K channels selected by\nthe proposed rule and the up to K channels selected by the genie-aided rule are likely to be with minor\ndifference, and thus, the reward loss is reduced. When K = 8 in our example, there is no difference\nbetween the channels selected by our proposed rule and the channels selected by the genie-aided rule,\nwhich means the reward loss is 0.\nCase II with partial channel sensing is then evaluated. Figs. 5 and 6 show average R(t)/ln t in homogeneous sensing with the proposed single channel access and multiple channel access rules, respectively,\nwhile Figs. 7 and 8 show average R(t)/ln t in heterogeneous sensing with the proposed single channel\naccess and multiple channel access rules, respectively. It can be seen from the four figures that when t\nis large, average R(t)/ln t tends to be finitely bounded, which is consistent with our claim in Section III\nthat R(t) \u223c O(ln t).\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the problem of dynamic channel sensing and access by a secondary user in a cognitive\nradio network is investigated. In the case with full channel sensing, with side information through\nsensing all the channels, the regret due to unknown primary users' statistical information is proved to be\nasymptotically finite. On the other hand, for the case with partial channel sensing, asymptotically finite\nregret cannot be achieved since it is proved that the regret is at least O(ln t). Therefore, in our research we\nderive channel sensing and access rules with regret O(ln t), for homogeneous sensing and heterogeneous\nsensing, respectively. This research should provide insights to the design of OSA in cognitive radio\nnetworks with unknown statistical information of primary channels. Further research may include the\ncase with competition among multiple secondary users and the generalization of our solutions in Case II\nto a more general bi-level MABP.\nA PPENDIX I\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 1\nRecall that \u0398 is the vector of real channel free probabilities, and in Step 3 of Algorithm 1, \u0398\u0302 is used\nto estimate \u0398.
