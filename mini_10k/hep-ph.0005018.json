The CDF collaboration has made a measurement of the\nCP-violating phase sin 2\u03b2 = 0.79+0.41\n\u22120.44 [1], leading to the nontrivial constraint sin 2\u03b2 > 0 at 93%\nC.L. The asymmetric e+ e\u2212 B-factories BaBar and Belle are now running and will hopefully\nmake measurements of CP-violating rate asymmetries in the B system before too long. And\nin the near future, data from HERA-B and hadron colliders will add to our knowledge of CP\nviolation in the B system.\nThe purpose of all this activity is to test the standard model (SM) explanation of CP\nviolation. In the SM, CP violation, which to date has been only seen in the kaon system, is due\nto the presence of a nonzero complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark\nmixing matrix V . In this scenario, one expects large CP-violating effects in B decays, and the\nabove experiments are searching for such signals.\nThe CP-violating signals which have been the most extensively studied are rate asymmetries in B decays [2]. Measurements of such asymmetries will allow one to cleanly probe\nthe interior angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 of the so-called unitarity triangle [3], which will in turn provide\nimportant tests of the SM.\nHowever, there is another class of CP-violating signals which has received relatively little\nattention: triple-product correlations [4]. In a given decay, it may be possible to measure the\nmomenta and/or spins of the particles involved. From these one can construct triple products\nof the form ~v1 * (~v2 \u00d7 ~v3 ), where each vi is a spin or momentum. Such triple products are\nodd under time reversal (T) and hence, by the CPT theorem, are also potential signals of CP\n\nviolation. (Note that there is a technical distinction to be made here: although the action of T\nchanges the sign of a triple product, if a triple product changes sign, it is not necessarily due to\nthe T transformation. This is because, in addition to reversing spins and momenta, the time\nreversal symmetry T also exchanges the initial and final states. Thus, in a particular decay,\na nonzero triple product is not necessarily a signal of T (and CP) violation. For this reason,\nin what follows we refer to triple-product asymmetries as T-odd effects. We also show how to\nestablish the presence of a true signal of T violation.)\nTo establish the presence of a nonzero triple-product correlation, one constructs a T-odd\n\n2\n\n\fasymmetry of the form\nAT \u2261\n\n\u0393(~v1 * (~v2 \u00d7 ~v3 ) > 0) \u2212 \u0393(~v1 * (~v2 \u00d7 ~v3 ) < 0)\n,\n\u0393(~v1 * (~v2 \u00d7 ~v3 ) > 0) + \u0393(~v1 * (~v2 \u00d7 ~v3 ) < 0)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the decay rate for the process in question. Unfortunately, triple-product correlations\nsuffer from a well-known complication: their signals can be faked by the presence of strong\nphases, even if there is no CP violation. (As noted above, this is because such correlations are\nnot true T-violating signals.) That is, one typically finds that\nAT \u221d sin(\u03c6 + \u03b4),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a weak, CP-violating phase and \u03b4 is a strong phase. From this we see that if \u03b4 6= 0,\n\na triple-product correlation will appear, even in the absence of CP violation (i.e. if \u03c6 = 0).\nTo remedy this, one can construct the T-violating asymmetry:\n1\nAT \u2261 (AT \u2212 \u0100T ) ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u0100T is the T-odd asymmetry measured in the CP-conjugate decay process. This is a\ntrue T-violating signal in that it is nonzero only if \u03c6 6= 0 (i.e. if CP violation is present).\n\nFurthermore, unlike decay-rate asymmetries in direct CP violation, a nonzero AT does not\nrequire the presence of a nonzero strong phase. Indeed:\n\nAT \u221d sin \u03c6 cos \u03b4 ,\n\n(4)\n\nso that the signal is maximized when the strong phase is zero.\nAs with all CP-violating signals, (at least) two decay amplitudes are necessary to produce\na triple-product correlation. Such correlations have been studied in semileptonic B decays [5].\nHowever, since there is only a single amplitude in the SM, any such signal can occur only in\nthe presence of new physics.\nTo our knowledge, the only study of triple products in the SM has been made by Valencia\n[6], who examined the decay B \u2192 V1 V2 , where V1 and V2 are vector mesons. He looked at triple\nproducts of the form ~k * (~\u01eb1 \u00d7~\u01eb2 ), where ~\u01eb1 and ~\u01eb2 are the polarizations of V1 and V2 , respectively,\n\nand ~k is the momentum of one of the vector mesons. Since the calculation was done at the\nmeson level, estimates of the various form factors were needed. The conclusion of this study\nwas that, within the SM, one could expect a T-violating asymmetry at the level of several\npercent.\n3\n\n\fIn this paper we re-examine the question of triple products in the SM using a complementary approach. In particular, we search for triple-product correlations at the quark level.\nThe motivation is the following: if a significant triple-product correlation exists at the hadron\nlevel, it must also exist at the quark level. After all, given that QCD (which is responsible for\nhadronization) is CP-conserving, it is difficult to see how one can generate a large T-violating\nasymmetry at the hadron level if it is absent at the quark level.\nOf course, the converse is not necessarily true: a large T-violating effect at the quark level\nmight be \"washed out\" during hadronization, since the spins and momenta of the quarks may\nnot correlate well with the spins and momenta of the hadrons. (The most obvious example\nof this is if spin-0 mesons are involved. In this case no information about the spins of the\nconstituent quarks can be obtained.) Thus, there may be considerable hadronic uncertainty in\ntaking a nonzero quark-level signal and applying it at the hadron level.\nWith this in mind, in this paper we examine the inclusive decay b \u2192 su\u016b within the\nSM. If there is a large ~k * (~\u01eb1 \u00d7 ~\u01eb2 ) triple product in B \u2192 V1 V2 , there should also be a large\n\ntriple product at the quark level of the form ~p * (~s \u00d7 ~s\u2032 ), where ~p is the momentum of one of\nthe quarks, and ~s and ~s\u2032 are the spins of two of the light quarks. And indeed, we find that the\nquark-level T-violating asymmetry due to the triple product ~pu * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) or p~\u016b * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) can\n\nbe as large as about 5%. This strongly supports Valencia's conclusion that the SM predicts a\nmeasurable T-violating asymmetry in B \u2192 V1 V2 .\n\nHowever, we also find another significant T-violating signal in b \u2192 su\u016b. It is due to the\n\ntriple-product ~sb * (~pu \u00d7 p~s ), which involves the b-quark spin and the momenta of the s and u\nquarks. In the SM, this signal turns out to be in the range of 1% to 3% of the total rate, which\nmay be measurable. It might be observable in decays such as \u039bb \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (though the usual\n\ncaveats about large hadronic uncertainties apply).\n\nFinally, it is also important to note which T-violating signals are not present. For\nexample, we find that there are no significant T-violating asymmetries in the SM which involve\nthe spin of the s-quark. Thus, should such an asymmetry be measured, it would be a clear sign\nof new physics.\nIn Sec. 2, we compute the triple products present in the decay b \u2192 su\u016b, and estimate\n\ntheir sizes. We discuss possible hadron-level applications in Sec. 3. We conclude in Sec. 4.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nTriple Products in b \u2192 su\u016b\n\nIn the inclusive decay b \u2192 su\u016b, the amplitude has two dominant contributions: the tree diagram\n\n(T ) due to W -boson exchange and the loop-level strong penguin diagram (P ). Furthermore, the\npenguin amplitude contains two dominant terms, P1 and P2 [7].

In P2 , q is the momentum of the internal gluon. The factors F1c and F2 are functions of\n2\n2\n(m2c /MW\n) and (m2t /MW\n), respectively, and take the values F1c \u2243 5.0 and F2 \u2243 0.2 for mt = 160\n\nGeV [7]. P1 and P2 are often called the chromoelectric dipole moment term and chromomagnetic\ndipole moment term, respectively.\nThe next step is the calculation of the square of the decay amplitude. We have:\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n|M|2 = |T |2 + |P1 |2 + |P2 |2 + 2Re T \u2020 P1 + 2Re T \u2020 P2 + 2Re P1\u2020 P2\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nWe will see below that the dominant term here is |P1 |2 .\nWe find triple products in all of the interference terms above (i.e. the last three terms of\n|M|2 ). Before giving the specific forms of these triple products, we make the following general\nremarks:\n\n\u2022 In the calculation, we neglect the masses of the light quarks s, u and \u016b, but we keep the\nspins (i.e. polarization four-vectors) of these particles (at least to begin with). It turns\n\nout that there are no triple products involving the polarization of the s quark. (In other\nwords, such terms are suppressed by at least ms /mb .) In light of this, in our results below,\nwe automatically sum over the s-quark spin states.\nThis is an interesting result: it suggests that if a triple product involving the s-quark\npolarization is observed experimentally, it is probably due to physics beyond the SM.\n\n5\n\n\f\u2022 Since the B meson has spin 0, triple products in B \u2192 V1 V2 cannot involve the spin of\nthe b-quark. If one sums over the spin of the b-quark, the only term which contains triple\n\nproducts is the T \u2212 P1 interference term. We will therefore use this term to estimate the\nsize of the T-violating asymmetry in B \u2192 V1 V2 [6].\n\n\u2022 If the spins of the u and \u016b quarks cannot be measured, one can then take them to be\nunpolarized, i.e. we sum over their polarizations. In this case, only the T \u2212 P2 and P1 \u2212 P2\n\ninterferences contain a triple product. This unique signal takes the form ~sb * (~pu \u00d7 p~s ).\n\n\u2022 In all interference terms, there are triple products which involve the three polarizations\n~sb , ~su and ~s\u016b . Experimentally, such signals will be extremely difficult to measure, and so\nare of less interest than the others described here.\n\nT \u2212 P1 interference\n\n2.1\n\nKeeping explicit the spins of the b-, u- and \u016b-quarks, the T-odd piece of the T \u2212 P1 interference\nterm is\n\"\n\nX\n\ns spins\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2020\n\n2Re T P1\n\n\u0011\n\n#\n\nT \u2212odd\n\n16\u03b1s G2F F1c\n=\nIm Vcs\u2217 VcbVus Vub\u2217 ei(\u03b41 \u2212\u03b4t )\n3\u03c0\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(\n\n\u00d7 2(pb * su ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcb p\u03bdu p\u03c1\u016b s\u03be\u016b \u2212 2(pb * pu ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcb s\u03bdu p\u03c1\u016b s\u03be\u016b + m2b \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcu s\u03bdu p\u03c1\u016b s\u03be\u016b\n\u0014\n\n+mb (sb * su ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcs p\u03bdu p\u03c1\u016b s\u03be\u016b \u2212 (sb * pu ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcs p\u03bd\u016b s\u03c1\u016b s\u03beu\n\u2212(ps *\n\np\u016b ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcu s\u03bdb s\u03c1u s\u03be\u016b\n\n+ (ps *\n\ns\u016b ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcu p\u03bd\u016b s\u03c1b s\u03beu\n\n\u0015)\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nHere, pi is the 4-momentum of the i-quark and si is its polarization four-vector.

Those terms which include\nsb (the last four terms in Eq. 7) also include the polarizations of the u- and \u016b-quarks (su and\ns\u016b ). Since all three spins must be measured, these triple products will be extremely difficult to\nobserve experimentally.

In order to identify the triple products implicit in these terms,\nwe have to choose a particular frame of reference. The most natural choice is the rest frame of\nthe b-quark, in which case Eq. 7 then takes the form\n\"\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 X\n2Re T \u2020 P1\n2 b,s spins\n\n#\n\n=\n\nT \u2212odd\n\n16\u03b1s G2F F1c\nIm Vcs\u2217 VcbVus Vub\u2217 ei\u22061t m2b\n3\u03c0\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nn\n\n\u00d7 s0u p~u * (~p\u016b \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) + Eu ~p\u016b * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) + s0\u016b ~pu * (~p\u016b \u00d7 ~su ) + E\u016b p~u * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b )\n\no\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u22061t \u2261 \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b4t . We therefore see that there are, in fact, four distinct triple products in\nthe T \u2212 P1 interference term.\n\nThese triple products depend on the polarization four-vectors of the u- and \u016b-quarks,\nwhose most general form is [8]\ns\u03bci\n\n=\n\n!\n\n~ni * p~i\n~ni * ~pi\n, ~ni +\n~pi ,\nmi\nmi (Ei + mi )\n\n(9)\n\nfor i = u, \u016b. In the above, ~ni is the polarization vector of the i-quark in its rest frame, and\nsatisfies |~ni | = 1.\nThe triple products in Eq. (8) all involve two spins, which makes their evaluation somewhat problematic. Since one has to choose directions for ~su and ~s\u016b , there are an infinite number\nof possibilities. We have studied three cases:\n1. The polarizations of the u- and \u016b-quarks in their respective centre-of-mass frames both\npoint in a particular direction, say ~nu = ~n\u016b = \u1e91.\n2. The polarizations of the u- and \u016b-quarks are perpendicular, say ~nu = \u1e91 and ~n\u016b = x\u0302.\n3. The polarization of the u-quark is longitudinal, ~nu = p\u0302u while ~n\u016b = \u1e91.\nIn the following we will refer to these three scenarios as Case I, Case II and Case III, respectively.\nIn order to compute the size of these triple-product asymmetries, in addition to integrating over phase space, we also need estimates of the sizes of the weak and strong phases. In\nthe Wolfenstein parametrization [9], we can write the T-odd combination of CKM and strong\nphases as\n\u0014\n\nIm\n\nVcs\u2217 Vcb Vus Vub\u2217 ei\u22061t\n\n\u0015\n\n= A2 \u03bb6 [\u03b7 cos \u22061t + \u03c1 sin \u22061t ] .\n7\n\n(10)\n\n\fCP violation in the CKM matrix is parametrized by the parameter \u03b7. As discussed in the\nintroduction, nonzero strong phases can fake a T-violating signal. The term \u03c1 sin \u22061t in the\nabove expression is an example of such a fake signal. However, by forming a true T-violating\nasymmetry AT (Eq. 3), one can eliminate this fake signal. In this case AT \u221d \u03b7 cos \u22061t .\nAt present, \u03b7 is constrained to lie in the range 0.23 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 0.50 [10]. Turning to the\n\nstrong phase, the tree-level phase \u03b4t is usually assumed to be small: the logic is that, roughly\nspeaking, the quarks will hadronize before having time to exchange gluons. On the other hand,\nfor the b \u2192 su\u016b penguin amplitude, it is often assumed that strong phases come from the\n\nabsorptive part of the penguin contribution [11]. Since P1 involves an internal c-quark, it is\n\npossible that \u03b41 6= 0, which of course implies that \u22061t 6= 0. Even so, for simplicity, in our\n\ncalculation we assume that \u22061t is small enough that cos \u22061t \u2243 1 is a good approximation.\n\nHowever, the reader should be aware that the asymmetries may be reduced should this strong\nphase be large. (Note that the T-violating signal is maximal when cos \u22061t = 1. For comparison,\ndirect CP-violating rate asymmetries require the strong phase to be nonzero.)\nWe have performed the phase-space integration using the computer program RAMBO.\nFor each of the three cases above we have calculated the four T-violating asymmetries [see\nEq. (3)] A1T , A2T , A3T , and A4T , which correspond respectively to the four triple products of\nEq. (8): s0u p~u * (~p\u016b \u00d7 ~s\u016b ), Eu p~\u016b * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ), s0\u016b p~u * (~p\u016b \u00d7 ~su ), and E\u016b ~pu * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ). We have taken\n\u03b7 = 0.4. Our results are as follows.\n\n1. Case I: The asymmetries A1T and A3T are both negligible. However, we find that A2T =\nA4T \u2243 4.6%.\n\n2. Case II: A1T and A3T are negligible, while A2T = A4T \u2243 3.9%.\n3. Case III: Here the triple products ~pu * (~p\u016b \u00d7~su ) and ~pu * (~su \u00d7~s\u016b ) vanish identically, so that\nA3T = A4T = 0. We find that the other two asymmetries are tiny: A2T = \u2212A1T \u2243 0.09%.\n\nFrom the above, we conclude that the asymmetries A1T and A3T are both very small in the SM,\n\nand that A2T and A4T can be as large as about 5%.\n\nNote that the triple product in B \u2192 V1 V2 discussed by Valencia [6] is of the form\n\n~k * (~\u01eb1 \u00d7 ~\u01eb2 ). In Eq. (8), it is the terms p~\u016b * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) and p~u * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) which could potentially\ngive such a triple-product signal. We have found that the asymmetries A2T and A4T , which\n\ncorrespond to these triple products, can be reasonably big (<\n\u223c 5%). This is consistent with the\n8\n\n\fresults found by Valencia at the meson level, and suggests that the SM does indeed predict a\nmeasurable T-violating asymmetry in B \u2192 V1 V2 decays. (Of course, due to our difficulties in\n\nunderstanding hadronization, it is not possible to use the quark-level result to predict the size\nof the asymmetry for a specific meson-level decay.)\n\nFinally, for comparison, consider the decay-rate asymmetry, calculated by Hou for the\nsame process [12]:\naCP (b \u2192 su\u016b) \u2243 1.4%\n\n(11)\n\nWe therefore see that one expects T-violating triple-product asymmetries in b \u2192 su\u016b to be\n\nconsiderably larger than the decay rate asymmetry.\n\n2.2\n\nP1 \u2212 P2 interference\n\nThe T-odd piece of the P1 \u2212 P2 interference term is\n\"\n\nX\n\n2Re\n\ns spins\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00d7\n\nP1\u2020 P2\n\n(\n\nh\n\n\u0011\n\n#\n\n=\nT \u2212odd\n\n4\u03b1s2 G2F F1c F2 mb\nIm Vts\u2217 Vtb Vcs Vcb\u2217 ei(\u03b42 \u2212\u03b41 )\n3\u03c0 2 q 2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\ni\n\npb * (pu \u2212 p\u016b ) (1 \u2212 su * s\u016b ) \u2212 (s\u016b * ps )(su * p\u016b ) + (su * ps )(s\u016b * pu ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcb s\u03bdb p\u03c1u p\u03bes\n\ni\nq2\n(su * ps ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be p\u03bcb s\u03bdb p\u03c1s s\u03be\u016b\n2\n)\nh\ni\nq2\n\u03bc \u03bd \u03c1 \u03be\n+ (s\u016b * pu )(p\u016b * ps ) \u2212 (s\u016b * ps ) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03be pb sb ps su .\n2\nh\n\n+ (su * p\u016b )(pu * ps ) \u2212\n\n(12)\n\nHere, if we average over the b-quark spin states, there is no T-violating signal at all.\nWe note that most of the terms in Eq. 12 correspond to triple products in which three\nspins must be measured. As we have already discussed, such signals are very difficult to observe\nexperimentally, and so do not interest us.

As usual, we are not interested in triple products involving three\nspins, and so we can therefore sum over su and s\u016b .

And, as before, we expect the \u03b4t piece of the strong phase \u22062t to be\nsmall. However, there is a difference here compared to the T \u2212 P1 case: previously, the penguin\n\namplitude P1 involved an internal c-quark, and so it was possible that the strong phase \u03b41t ,\nwhich is related to the absorptive part of the amplitude, could be sizeable. Here, the triple\nproduct involves only the t-quark penguin contribution P2 , which is purely dispersive, and so\nleads to \u03b42 = 0. Thus, it is an excellent approximation to set \u22062t \u2243 0.\nIn the rest frame of the b-quark, the triple-product of Eq. 14 is mb ps * pu ~sb * (~pu \u00d7 p~s ).\n\nIntegrating over phase space using RAMBO, and using the allowed range for \u03b7, we find that\nthis T-violating triple-product asymmetry can be of the order of several percent:\n1.3% <\n\u223c AT (b \u2192 su\u016b) <\n\u223c 3.2% .\n\n(15)\n\nThis could conceivably be measured at a future experiment.\nFurthermore, if it is found that this asymmetry is considerably larger than the above\nvalues, it is probably a signal of new physics. For example, in some models of new physics, the\nchromomagnetic dipole moment F2 can be enhanced up to ten times its SM value [13]. This\nwill clearly have an enormous affect on the above asymmetry.\n\n10\n\n\f3\n\nApplications\n\nIn the previous section, in our study of the quark-level decay b \u2192 su\u016b within the SM, we found\n\ntwo classes of triple products whose T-violating asymmetry is large. They are: (i) Eu p~\u016b *(~su \u00d7~s\u016b )\n\nand E\u016b ~pu * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ), and (ii) mb ps * pu ~sb * (~pu \u00d7 p~s ). The next obvious question is then: how\n\ncan one test these results?\n\nThe ideal way would be to make triple-product measurements inclusively. If this were\npossible, then it would be straightforward to compare the experimental values with the theoretical predictions. However, this may not be experimentally feasible, in which case we must\nturn to exclusive B decays.\nThe first class of triple-product asymmetries can be studied in B \u2192 V1 V2 decays which\n\nare dominated by the quark-level process b \u2192 su\u016b. Examples of such decays include Bd0 \u2192 \u03c1K \u2217 ,\n\nBs0 \u2192 K \u2217+ K \u2217\u2212 , Bc\u2212 \u2192 D \u2217 K \u2217\u2212 , etc. These have been examined by Valencia, and we refer the\nreader to Ref. [6] for details.\n\nTurning to the second class of triple products, it is clear that we cannot use decays of B\nmesons to obtain these asymmetries: since the B-meson spin is zero, there is no way to measure\nthe spin of the b-quark (which is the only spin contributing to the triple product). However,\none possibility would be to use the \u039bb baryon, whose spin is largely that of the b quark. For\nexample, we can consider the process \u039bb \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The triple product ~sb * (~pu \u00d7 p~s ) can be\n\nroughly equated to ~s\u039bb * (~p\u03c0+ \u00d7 p~\u039b ).\n\nAnother possibility is to consider a B \u2217 meson decaying into any two mesons Xs X, where\nXs and X then decay respectively into mesons \u03a61 \u03a62 and \u03a63 \u03a64 (since with only one spin, we\nneed three independent momenta). The triple product ~sb * (~pu \u00d7~ps ) may then be roughly related\n\nto ~sB\u2217 * (~p\u03a61 \u00d7 ~p\u03a63 ).\n\nIn the above, we have been deliberately vague about the relationship between the triple\nproducts at the quark and hadron levels. We do not understand hadronization of quarks into\nmesons all that well, and when one adds the complication of relating the quark spins to the\nhadron spins, things are even more uncertain. Given that there is a large quark-level tripleproduct asymmetry, there may be one at the hadron level. However, if experiment does not\nfind such an asymmetry, this may not be a sign of new physics \u2013 it may simply mean that the\nasymmetry has been washed out during hadronization. Regardless of the results, studies of this\n\n11\n\n\fkind are likely to help us understand how quarks hadronize into mesons and baryons.\nFinally, we note that certain quark-level triple products are predicted to be small in the\nSM. For example, triple products involving the spin of the s-quark are suppressed by powers\nof its mass. Hence, if a T-violating asymmetry due to a triple product involving the s-quark\nspin were found to be sizeable, this would probably indicate the presence of new physics. The\ndecay \u039bb \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , which was mentioned above, can be used to test this. The spin of the \u039b\n\nis due mostly to the s-quark spin. So any T-violating asymmetry involving the spin of the \u039b,\n\nsuch as ~s\u039bb * (~s\u039b \u00d7 p~\u039b ), should be tiny in the SM.\nAs another example, recall that we found that T \u2212 P1 interference produced the triple\n\nproducts s0u ~pu *(~p\u016b \u00d7~s\u016b ) and s0\u016b p~u *(~p\u016b \u00d7~su ). However, the corresponding T-violating asymmetries\n\nA1T and A3T turned out to be suppressed dynamically. Consider the decay of a B-meson to two\n\nvector mesons, B \u2192 V1 V2 , where the V2 then subsequently decays to two mesons \u03a61 \u03a62 . Roughly\nspeaking, one can relate s0u p~u * (~p\u016b \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) to \u01eb0V1 p~V1 * (~\u01ebV2 \u00d7 ~p\u03a61 ). Thus, the measurement of a\nnonzero value for this latter triple-product asymmetry would be a signal for new physics.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have calculated the quark-level triple-product correlations in the decay b \u2192 su\u016b within the\n\nstandard model. Although several such triple products are present, we find that only two types\nlead to sizeable T-violating asymmetries.\nThe first type includes p~u * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ) and ~p\u016b * (~su \u00d7 ~s\u016b ). We find that the corresponding\n\nT-violating asymmetries can be as large as about 5%. This triple product can be probed in\nB \u2192 V1 V2 decays, where V1 and V2 are vector mesons [6].\nThe second type is ~sb * (~pu \u00d7 ~ps ), where ~sb is the polarization of the b-quark, and p~u\n\nand p~s are the momenta of the u- and s-quark, respectively. We calculate that the T-violating\nasymmetry for this triple product is in the range 1%\u20133%, which may be measurable. There\nare several ways to try to search for this triple-product asymmetry. For example, one could\nstudy the decay \u039bb \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , looking for a nonzero triple product ~s\u039bb * (~p\u03c0+ \u00d7 p~\u039b ). Another\n\npossibility is to examine the decay B \u2217 \u2192 Xs X, where Xs and X then decay respectively into\n\nmesons \u03a61 \u03a62 and \u03a63 \u03a64 , and to search for the triple product ~sB\u2217 * (~p\u03a61 \u00d7 p~\u03a63 ).\n\nThe fact that we find only two large triple-product correlations has interesting conse12\n\n\fquences. If a triple product is tiny at the quark level, it is probably tiny at the hadron level\nas well. After all, the hadronization of quarks into hadrons is a strong-interaction process,\nand QCD is CP-conserving. It is therefore difficult to see how one can generate a large tripleproduct correlation at the hadron level, given that it is small at the quark level. (Of course,\nthe converse is not necessarily true: it is quite possible that a quark-level CP-violating effect\nmight be \"washed out\" during hadronization.)\nFrom the point of view of looking for physics beyond the SM, it is therefore important\nto identify those triple-product asymmetries which are expected to be small in the SM. If such\nasymmetries are found to be large, this is probably a signal of new physics. For example, we\nfind that triple products involving the spin of the s-quark are suppressed by powers of its mass.\nThus, if, for instance, a sizeable T-violating asymmetry of the form ~s\u039bb * (~s\u039b \u00d7 p~\u039b ) were found\nin the decay \u039bb \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , this would be compelling evidence for the presence of new physics,\nsince the spin of the \u039b is due largely to the s-quark spin.\n\nNote that we have performed the calculation at the quark level, and the passage from\nquarks to hadrons is not well understood. Thus, in addition to being an interesting signal of T\nand CP violation, the study of T-violating triple-product asymmetries may help us understand\naspects of hadronization.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nW.B. would like to thank P.
