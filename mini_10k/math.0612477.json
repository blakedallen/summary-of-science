Let C and D be two corings over a ring A and C \u2212\u2192 D be a morphism of corings.\nWe investigate the situation when the associated induced (\"corestriction of scalars\") functor\nMC \u2212\u2192 MD is a Frobenius functor, and call these morphisms Frobenius extensions of corings.\nThe characterization theorem generalizes notions such as Frobenius corings and is applied to\nseveral situations; in particular, provided some (general enough) flatness conditions hold, the\nnotion proves to be dual to that of Frobenius extensions of rings (algebras). Several finiteness\ntheorems are given for each case we consider; these theorems extend existing results from\nFrobenius extensions of rings or from Frobenius corings, showing that a certain finiteness\nproperty almost always occur for many instances of Frobenius functors.\n\nIntroduction\nLet A be an algebra over a field K. A is called Frobenius if the right regular A-module A is\nisomorphic to the K-dual of A, A\u2217 . More generally, if \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B is a morphism of rings, then\nthis is called a Frobenius extension if B is finitely generated projective as left A-module and\nB \u2243 HomA (B, A). Equivalent characterizations of this concept have lead to the introduction\nof the concept of Frobenius functor: a functor F : C \u2212\u2192 D between two categories C and\nD is called Frobenius if and only if it has both left and right adjoints and its left adjoint\nis naturally isomorphic to its right adjoint. This concept was first introduced by Morita in\n[Mo], and is inspired by an equivalent characterization of Frobenius extensions of rings: an\n\u03c6\nextension A \u2212\u2192 B is Frobenius if and only if the associated forgetful functor from MB to MA\nis Frobenius in the above specified sense. It turns out that this concept is left right symmetric.\nFurther notions have been introduced and studied in connection to the notion of Frobenius\nfunctor.\nIf C is a coring over a ring A, with counit \u03b5C : C \u2212\u2192 A, then there is an associated induced\n(forgetful) functor U going from the category MC of right comodules over C to MA associating\nto each comodule M the underlying A-module M . C is called a Frobenius coring provided that\nU is a Frobenius functor. Given an extension of rings \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B, a certain B-coring structure\ncan be introduced on B \u2297A B called canonical Sweedler coring structure which connects the\nnotion of Frobenius extension of rings to that of Frobenius corings, i.e. given certain flatness\n\u03c6\nconditions hold, A \u2212\u2192 B is a Frobenius extension if and only if the B-coring B \u2297A B is\nFrobenius.\nIn this paper we aim to introduce and study the concept of Frobenius extensions of Corings,\na notion which generalizes all these notions and also recovers some other known instances of\nFrobenius functors, as for example, the finite coproduct functor for a category of modules (or\nmore generally, of comodules over a coring). Given two A-corings C and D and a morphism of\ncorings \u03bb : C \u2212\u2192 D, we can associate a \"forgetful functor\" (called corestriction functor) U from\nMC to MD , which associates to each C-comodule (M, \u03c1M ) the D-comodule (M, (M \u2297 \u03bb) \u25e6 \u03c1M ),\nKey words and phrases. corings, Frobenius functor.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The extension\n\u03bb\nC \u2212\u2192 D will be called Frobenius if U is a Frobenius functor. When certain flatness conditions\nhold, U has a right adjoint F constructed by using the cotensor product: F = \u2212\u0003D C. The\nflatness conditions required will prove not to be very restrictive allowing us to apply the\nconsiderations to several situations, and therefore look for equivalent conditions for F to be also\na left adjoint for U . The characterization formula we obtain will prove to be a close dualization\nof the one characterizing the case of Frobenius extensions of rings, and in particular for the\ncase of extensions of coalgebras we obtain a theorem which is dual to the one characterizing\nFrobenius extensions of algebras.\nIt is notable that in the case of Frobenius extensions of rings as well as for Frobenius corings\n\u03c6\ncertain finiteness theorems hold: if the functor U associated to an extension of rings A \u2212\u2192 B\n(or to an A-coring C) is Frobenius then B is finitely generated projective as left (and as right)\nA-module (or C is finitely generated projective as left and as right A-module). We aim to\nprove several such finiteness theorems. For each situation of Frobenius extension of corings\nwe consider we give a finiteness theorem. One application is for the coproduct of comodules\nindexed by a set I functor; it is known from [I1] that the coproduct is a Frobenius functor\n(equivalently, the product of comodules exist and is isomorphic to the coproduct) if and only\nif the index set I is finite; this finiteness property will follow also as an application of the\ncharacterization of Frobenius extensions of corings Theorem. Another application is with\n\u03bb\nFrobenius extensions of coalgebras. We prove that if C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension of\ncoalgebras over a field then dim(C) \u2264 dim(D) or they are both finite. Finally, we give some\n\u03bb\n\nconnections between Frobenius extensions of coalgebras C \u2212\u2192 D and the Frobenius property\n\u03bb\u2217\nof the dual extension of algebras D \u2217 \u2212\u2192 C \u2217 , showing that these are equivalent whenever C or\nD is finite dimensional.\n1. Extensions of Corings and associated functors\nLet A be a ring and C and D be two A-corings. Denote by \u2206C , \u03b5C and \u2206D , \u03b5D the comultiplication and respectively counit of C and D respectively. Our convention is to write \u2297 every\ntime we write a tensor product over A of A-modules. For c \u2208 C we use the Sweedler notation\n\u2206C (c) = c1 \u2297 c2 \u2208 C \u2297 C with the omitted summation symbol. Also, if M is a right (or left) C\ncomodule with comultiplication \u03c1 : M \u2192 M \u2297 C (or \u03c1 : M \u2192 C \u2297 M ) we write \u03c1(m) = m0 \u2297 m1\n(or m\u22121 \u2297 m0 ). For basic facts on corings and their comodules the reader is referred to [BW].\nLet (C, \u2206C , \u03b5C ) and (D, \u2206D , \u03b5D ) be A-corings and \u03bb : C \u2192 D be a morphism of corings, that\nis, \u03bb(c)1 \u2297 \u03bb(c)2 = \u03bb(c1 ) \u2297 \u03bb(c2 ) and \u03b5D (\u03bb(c)) = \u03b5C (c). Then there is an associated functor U : MC \u2192 MD , called the corestriction functor and defined by U (M ) = M with the\nright D-comodule structure given by m 7\u2192 m0 \u2297 \u03bb(m1 ). In particular, C has a D-bicomodule\nstructure. Recall that for a right C-comodule M and a left C-comodule N the cotensor product of M and N over C, M \u0003C N is defined as follows: let \u03c9M,N : M \u2297 N \u2192 M \u2297 C \u2297 N ,\n\u03c9M,N = \u03c1M \u2297 C \u2212 C \u2297 \u03c1N . Then M \u0003C N is defined as the abelian group arising as the kernel\nof \u03c9M,N , that is we have an exact sequence\n0\n\n\u2732 M \u0003C N\n\n\u2732 M \u2297N\n\n\u03c9M,N\n\n\u2732 M \u2297C \u2297N\n\nIf f : M \u2212\u2192 M \u2032 is a morphism of right C-comodules and g : N \u2212\u2192 N \u2032 is a morphism of left Ccomodules then one can define f \u0003C g : M \u0003C N \u2212\u2192 M \u2032 \u0003C N \u2032 by (f \u0003C g)(m \u2297 n) = f (m) \u2297 g(n).\nLet N be a right D-comodule. If A C is flat, then by tensoring the exact sequence\n\u03c9N,C\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 N \u0003D C \u2212\u2192 N \u2297 C \u2212\u2192 N \u2297 D \u2297 C\n\n\fFROBENIUS EXTENSIONS OF CORINGS\n\n3\n\nwith C on the right hand side we obtain the exact sequence\n\u03c9N,C \u2297C\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 (N \u0003D C) \u2297 C \u2212\u2192 N \u2297 C \u2297 C \u2212\u2192 N \u2297 D \u2297 C\nand therefore (N \u0003D C) \u2297 C \u223c\n= N \u0003D (C \u2297 C) by the natural mapping n \u2297 c \u2297 c\u2032 7\u2192 n \u2297 c \u2297 c\u2032 . This\nallows us to define a right C-comodule structure on N \u0003D C by N \u0003D C \u220b n \u2297 c 7\u2192 n \u2297 c1 \u2297 c2 \u2208\nN \u0003D (C \u2297 C) \u223c\n= (N \u0003D C) \u2297 C. More generally, we say that the coring morphism \u03bb is (right)\npure if for every right C-comodule N the morphism \u03c9N,C is C-pure in MA (see [BW], Section\n24, 24.8). In this case, the above isomorphism always holds.\nThen we can define a functor F from MD , the category of all right D-comodules to MC\nby writing F (N ) = N \u0003D C. If f : N \u2192 N \u2032 is a morphism in MD , then F (f ) = f \u0003D C,\nF (f )(n \u2297 c) = f (n) \u2297 c. By [BW], Section 22 (22.10) and Section 24 (24.11) we have that\nif A C is flat or more generally, if \u03bb is a pure morphism of corings, then F is right adjoint to\nU . Therefore, in this case the functor U is Frobenius if and only if F is also a left adjoint\nto U , because any two left (or right) adjoints of a functor are naturally equivalent (Kan,\n[Kn]). In order even have a functor F : MD \u2212\u2192 MC , we will always assume that either\n\u03bb is a pure morphism of corings or A C is flat or, more generally, the canonical morphism\n\u223c\n(N \u0003D C) \u2297 C \u2192 N \u0003D (C \u2297 C) is an isomorphism (equivalently, \u03c9N,C is C-pure in MA ; see [BW]\n21.4). Otherwise, F makes sense only when considered with values in MA and the problem is\nnot well posed. For convenience, we introduce the\n\u223c\n(\u2217) condition: we say that the (\u2217) condition is fulfilled if the canonical morphism (N \u0003D C)\u2297C \u2192\nN \u0003D (C \u2297 C) is an isomorphism for all N \u2208 MD .\nRecall (for example from [CMZ] or [McL]) that F is a left adjoint to U (so we have an\nadjointnes of functors (F, U )) if and only if there are natural transformations \u03b7 : IMD \u2212\u2192 U F\nand \u03b5 : F U \u2212\u2192 IMC such that\n(1)\n\n\u03b5F (N ) \u25e6 F (\u03b7N ) = IF (N ) , \u2200N \u2208 MD\n\n(2)\n\nU (\u03b5M ) \u25e6 \u03b7U (M ) = IU (M ) , \u2200M \u2208 MC\n\nor, as U (M ) = M for all M \u2208 MC and U (f ) = f for any morphism of right C-comodules f ,\nequation (2) rewrites to\n(3)\n\n\u03b5M \u25e6 \u03b7M\n\n= IM , \u2200M \u2208 MC .\n\nIt is then natural to try to compute the (sets of) natural transformations Nat(IMD , U F ) and\nNat(F U, IMC ).\nProposition 1.1. Assume the (\u2217) condition is satisfied.

Take \u03b7 \u2208 Nat(IMD , U F ). Let N \u2208 MD . For each n \u2208 N define fn : D \u2192 N \u2297 D\nby fn (d) = n \u2297 d.

Now the relation \u03b7D = \u03b9\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b1 rewrites\n(6)\n\nd1 \u2297 \u03b1(d2 ) = \u03b7D (d) = \u03b9\u22121 (\u03b1(d)) = \u03bb(\u03b1(d)1 ) \u2297 \u03b1(d)2\n\nand this is exactly the fact that \u03b1 is a morphism of left D-comodules. Therefore \u03b1 \u2208\nD HomD (D, C).\nConversely, start with such an \u03b1. Then relation (6) holds and consequently for N \u2208 MD\nand n \u2208 N , we have n00 \u2297 n01 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ) = n0 \u2297 n1 \u2297 \u03b1(n2 ) = n0 \u2297 \u03bb(\u03b1(n1 )1 ) \u2297 \u03b1(n1 )2 (by\napplying the coassociativity of the comultiplication and (6) for n1 , the second position of\n\u03c1N (n) = n0 \u2297 n1 \u2208 N \u2297 D). This shows that actually n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ) \u2208 Ker (\u03c9N,C ) and therefore\nit makes sense to define \u03b7N : N \u2212\u2192 N \u0003D C, \u03b7N (n) = n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ). Because \u03b1 is a morphism of\n\n\fFROBENIUS EXTENSIONS OF CORINGS\n\n5\n\nright D-comodules we get\n\u03c1N \u0003D C (\u03b7N (n)) = \u03b7N (n)0 \u2297 \u03b7N (n)1 = \u03c1N \u0003D C (n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ))\n= n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 )1 \u2297 \u03bb(\u03b1(n1 )2 ) (the right D comodule structure on N\u0003D C\ncomes from the right C comodule structure via \u03bb : C \u2212\u2192 D)\n= n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ) \u2297 n2 (as \u03b1 is a morphism in MD )\n= \u03b7N (n0 ) \u2297 n1\nThis shows that \u03b7N is a morphism of right D-comodules. Now note that \u03b7 is a natural\ntransformation: indeed if f : N \u2212\u2192 N \u2032 is a morphism of right D-comodules we need to show\nthat the following diagram is commutative:\nN\n\n\u03b7N\u2732\n\nN \u0003D C\n\nf\n\nf \u0003D C\n\u2744\n\nN\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 N \u2032 \u0003D C\n\n\u03b7N \u2032\n\nThis follows as for n \u2208 N\n\u03b7N \u2032 (f (n)) = f (n)0 \u2297 \u03b1(f (n)1 )\n= f (n0 ) \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ) (because f (n)0 \u2297 f (n)1 = f (n0 ) \u2297 n1 as\nf is a morphism in MD )\n= (f \u0003D C)(\u03b7N (n))\nNow note that for \u03b7 \u2208 Nat(IMD , U F ) we have \u03b7N (n) = n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ) and therefore \u03b7 = \u03b7(\u03b1)\nwith the notations in the statement of the proposition. Thus\n(7)\n\n\u03b7 = \u03b7(\u03b9 \u25e6 \u03b7D )\n\nAlso for \u03b1 \u2208 D HomD (D, C), \u03b7(\u03b1)N (n) = n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 ) and then we get that (\u03b9 \u25e6 \u03b7D (\u03b1))(d) =\n\u03b9(d1 \u2297 \u03b1(d2 )) = \u03b5D (d1 )\u03b1(d2 ) = \u03b1(\u03b5D (d1 )d2 ) = \u03b1(d). Therefore\n(8)\n\n\u03b9 \u25e6 \u03b7D (\u03b1) = \u03b1\n\nNow equations (7) and (8) show that the applications in the statement of the proposition are\ninverse to each other, and the proof is finished.\n\u0003\nFor each natural transformation \u01eb \u2208 Nat(F U, IMC ) we can associate \u03b2 \u2208 HomC (C\u0003D C, C) by\nputting \u03b2 = \u01ebC . Under certain conditions this also becomes a morphism of left C-comodules. In\nfact, for C\u0003D C to have a left C-comodule structure we need an isomorphism of A-(bi)modules\nC \u2297 (C\u0003D C) \u2243 (C \u2297 C)\u0003D C. Therefore in the next Proposition we will assume that \u03c9 =\n\u03c9C,C is pure in A M. This is not a very restrictive condition as it will be seen that it holds\nmany situations including in all the cases of our applications. Moreover, this condition is\nautomatically fulfilled when the functors (F, U ) form a Frobenius pair. If this does not hold,\nit will be seen from the proof of the following proposition that it is difficult to describe these\nnatural transformations.\nProposition 1.2.

Let M be a right C-comodule and \u01eb \u2208 Nat(F U, IMC ). Denote \u03b2 = \u01ebC .

Pick m \u2297 c \u2208 M \u0003D C.

We convey to identify each element from M \u2297 (C\u0003D C) with its image\nvia \u03c8M , for convenience.

Let \u03bb : C \u2212\u2192 D be a morphism of corings. We say C \u2212\u2192 D is a right\nFrobenius extension of corings (or \u03bb is Frobenius) if the functor U : MC \u2212\u2192 MD is a Frobenius\nfunctor.\nIn the case the categories MC and MD are abelian categories, then if (F, U ) form an adjoint\npair (i.e. F is a left adjoint for U ) then F is right exact. We can see that this is also true for\nmore general categories, in particular for the case we are interested in. Recall from [BW] that\nthe category of right C-comodules MC has cokernels and the image of every morphism of right\nu\nv\nC-comodules f : M \u2212\u2192 M \u2032 is a subcomodule in M \u2032 .

A\ncertain right exactness of F that we need can be proved here without the assumption that MC\nand MD are abelian, which in turn is used to prove that the condition \u03c9C,C is pure in A M\n\u03bb\n\nholds when C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension. Following the ideas from [BW] 21.5, 18.16, 3.19\nand 3.3, we can prove the following\nProposition 1.4. Suppose the (\u2217)-condition holds and that (F, U ) form an adjoint pair, i.e.,\nF is a left adjoint to U . Then \u03c9C,C is pure in A M.\nProof. By [BW], Section 21 (21.4, Tensor-cotensor relations) we see that \u03c9C,C is pure in A M\nif and only if the canonical morphism \u03c8M : M \u2297 (C\u0003D C) \u2212\u2192 (M \u2297 C)\u0003D C is an isomorphism\nfor any M \u2208 A M. Let F2 \u2212\u2192 F1 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 0 be an exact sequence of A-modules with free\nA-modules F2 and F1 . Then we have the commutative diagram\n(F2 \u2297 C)\u0003D C \u2732 (F1 \u2297 C)\u0003D C \u2732 (M \u2297 C)\u0003D C\n\u273b\n\n\u273b\n\n\u03c8F2 \u2243\n\n\u03c8F1 \u2243\n\n\u27320\n\n\u273b\n\nF2 \u2297 (C\u0003D C) \u2732 F1 \u2297 (C\u0003D C) \u2732 M \u2297 (C\u0003D C) \u2732 0\nwhere the bottom row is exact by the right exactness of the tensor product and the first\ntwo vertical arrows are isomorphisms because the tensor and cotensor product commute with\ncoproducts. Then in order to finish the proof, by the above diagram it is enough to prove\nthat the top row is exact as a sequence of A-modules, that is, the sequence F (F2 \u2297 C) \u2212\u2192\nF (F1 \u2297 C) \u2212\u2192 F (M \u2297 C) \u2212\u2192 0 is an exact sequence of A-modules (M \u2297 C = U (M \u2297 C) is\nconsidered here as a D-comodule). Denote Z = F2 \u2297 C, Y = F1 \u2297 C, X = M \u2297 C. Because F\nis a left adjoint to U , for every right C-comodule W we have a commutative diagram\n0\n(D1)\n\n\u2732 HomC (F (X), W ) \u2732 HomC (F (Y ), W ) \u2732 HomC (F (Z), W )\n\n\u2243\n0\n\n\u2243\n\n\u2243\n\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomD (X, U (W )) \u2732 HomD (Y, U (W )) \u2732 HomD (Z, U (W ))\n\nWe prove that the bottom row of this last diagram is commutative for every W \u2208 MC , and\nthis will imply that the top row is exact too. By [BW], Section 3 (3.3) we have that for any\ntwo right D-comodules N and N \u2032 there is an exact sequence of abelian groups\n\u03bdN,N \u2032\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 HomD (N, N \u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 HomA (N, N \u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 HomA (N, N \u2032 \u2297 D)\nwhere \u03bdN,N \u2032 (f ) = \u03c1N \u2032 \u25e6 f \u2212 (f \u2297 C) \u25e6 \u03c1N . Therefore, as in [BW], 3.19, we have a commutative\ndiagram yielded by the exactness of the sequence of A modules Z \u2212\u2192 Y \u2212\u2192 X \u2212\u2192 0 which\n\n\fFROBENIUS EXTENSIONS OF CORINGS\n\n9\n\nis easy to see that it is exact also as a sequence of right D-comodules (because it is exact in\nMA ; note that we do not need to have that A D is flat so that the category A M to be abelian).\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomD (X, U (W ))\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomD (Y, U (W ))\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomD (Z, U (W ))\n\n0\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomA (X, U (W ))\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomA (Y, U (W ))\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomA (Z, U (W ))\n\n0\n\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2732 HomA (X, U (W ) \u2297 D) \u2732 HomA (Y, U (W ) \u2297 D) \u2732 HomA (Z, U (W ) \u2297 D)\n\nThe two bottom rows are exact by the properties of the HomA (\u2212, \u2212) functor and the vertical\ncolumns are exact by the previous observation ([BW], 3.3). Then it follows that the top row\nof this last diagram exact (in A M), that is, the bottom row of (D1) is exact and therefore the\nv\nu\nfirst row in diagram (D1) is exact too. Now denote F (Z) \u2212\u2192 F (Y ) \u2212\u2192 F (X) the morphisms\ninduced by F from the exact sequence Z \u2212\u2192 Y \u2212\u2192 X \u2212\u2192 0. Put W = F (X)/Im(u) (which\nhas a natural C-comodule structure as Im(u) is a subcomodule of F (X)!) and \u03c0 : F (X) \u2212\u2192\nF (X)/Im(u) the canonical projection. As the first row in diagram (D1) is exact, we see that\nHomC (u, W ) is injective. But HomC (u, W )(\u03c0) = \u03c0 \u25e6 u = 0, so \u03c0 = 0 and therefore Im(u) =\nF (X). Now as Im(v) is a subcomodule of F (Y ), for the right C-comodule W = F (Y )/Im(v)\nand the canonical projection p : F (Y ) \u2212\u2192 F (Y )/Im(v), from the exactness in (D1) we again\nfind that Ker (HomC (v, W )) = Im(HomC (u, W )). Then HomC (v, W )(p) = p \u25e6 v = 0, so p \u2208\nKer (HomC (v, W )) and therefore there is h : F (X) \u2212\u2192 W such that h \u25e6 u = p. Hence if\ny \u2208 F (Y ) is such that u(y) = 0, we get h(u(y)) = 0 so p(y) = 0, i.e. y \u2208 Im(v) showing\nthat Im(v) \u2286 Ker (u). The converse inclusion is obvious as u \u25e6 v = 0 (it follows from the\nfunctoriality of F and the exactness of the sequence Z \u2212\u2192 Y \u2212\u2192 X \u2212\u2192 0). With this, we\nget that the sequence\n(F2 \u2297 C)\u0003D C \u2212\u2192 (F1 \u2297 C)\u0003D C \u2212\u2192 (M \u2297 C)\u0003D C \u2212\u2192 0\nis exact (in A M) and the proof is finished as shown before.\n\n\u0003\n\u03bb\n\nTheorem 1.5.

Assume C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension. Then by Proposition 1.4 we have that \u03c9C,C\nis pure in A M. As (F, U ) is a Frobenius pair of adjoint functors, we have that F is also a\nleft adjoint to U . Let \u03b7 : IMD \u2212\u2192 U F and \u01eb : F U \u2212\u2192 IMC be the unit and counit of this\nadjunction, thus satisfying the equations (1) and (2). Then note that Propositions 1.1 and 1.2\n\n\f10\n\nMIODRAG CRISTIAN IOVANOV\n\napply, and then we obtain \u03b1 \u2208 D HomD (D, C) and \u03b2 \u2208 C HomC (C\u0003D C, C) such that for N \u2208 MD\nand n \u2208 N\n(16)\n\n\u03b7N (n) = n0 \u2297 \u03b1(n1 )\n\nand for M \u2208 MC and m \u2297 c \u2208 M \u0003D C\n(17)\n\n\u01ebM (m \u2297 c) = m0 \u03b5C (\u03b2(m1 \u2297 c))\n\nBy the naturality of \u01eb we have\n(18)\n\n\u03b2 \u25e6 (\u03b9\u0003D C) = \u03b9 \u25e6 \u01ebF (D)\n\u223c\n\nwhere \u03b9 : D\u0003D C \u2212\u2192 C is the isomorphism from Proposition 1.1.

Conversely, assume there are \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that (15) holds and\nalso that \u03c9C,C is pure in A M. Then again by Propositions 1.1 and 1.2 we can find the natural\ntransformations \u03b7 : IMD \u2212\u2192 U F and \u01eb : F U \u2212\u2192 IMC such that conditions (16) and (17) are\nfulfilled.

Equations (1) and (2) show that F is also a left adjoint to U which amounts\n\u03bb\n\nto the fact that F is a right adjoint to U , showing that C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension. \u0003\n\n\fFROBENIUS EXTENSIONS OF CORINGS\n\n11\n\nRemark 1.6.

Indeed, if h \u2208 C HomC (M, C), then u = \u03b5C \u25e6 h \u2208 A HomA (M, C) and\nu(m0 )m1 = \u03b5C (h(m0 ))m1 = \u03b5(h(m)1 )h(m)2 (because h is a morphism of right C-comodules)\nand therefore u(m0 )m1 = h(m) and similarly m\u22121 u(m0 ) = h(m) so\n(19)\n\nm\u22121 u(m0 ) = u(m0 )m1\n\nConversely, for u \u2208 A HomA (M, A) which satisfies (19), we can easily see that hu = (m 7\u2192\nu(m0 )m1 = m\u22121 u(m0 )) is a morphism of left and also of right C-comodules because of (19)\nand that \u03b5C \u25e6 h = u if and only if h = hu .

Then C \u2212\u2192 A = C \u2212\u2192\nA is an extension of corings because \u03bb(c1 ) \u2297 \u03bb(c2 ) =\n\u03b5C (c1 ) \u2297A \u03b5C (c2 ) = \u03b5C (c1 )\u03b5C (c2 ) \u2297A 1 = \u03b5C (c1 \u03b5C (c2 )) \u2297 1 = \u03b5C (c) \u2297 1 = \u03bb(c)1 \u2297 \u03bb(c)2 . Moreover,\nthe forgetful functor MC \u2212\u2192 MA associating to each right C-comodule M the underlying\nA-module M is coincides with the corestriction functor associated to the morphism \u03bb = \u03b5C .\nThe following Proposition follows from [BW], Theorem 27.8. However we can obtain this from\nour generalization on Frobenius extensions of corings.\n\u03b5\n\nC\nProposition 2.4. (Frobenius corings) Let C be a coring. The extension of corings C \u2212\u2192\nA\nfrom Example 2.3 is (right or left) Frobenius if and only if there is a Frobenius system (e, \u03c0),\ne \u2208 C A = {x \u2208 C | ax = xa, \u2200 a \u2208 A} and \u03c0 \u2208 C HomC (C \u2297A C, C) such that\n\n\u03c0(c \u2297 e) = \u03c0(e \u2297 c) = c\nProof. It is not difficult to see that we have an exact sequence\n1C\u2297C\n\n\u03c9C,C\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 C \u2297 C \u2212\u2192 C \u2297 C \u2212\u2192 C \u2297 C \u2297 C\n\n\fFROBENIUS EXTENSIONS OF CORINGS\n\n13\n\nbecause \u03c9C,C (c \u2297 c\u2032 ) = c \u2297 1 \u2297 c\u2032 \u2212 c \u2297 1 \u2297 c\u2032 = 0 by the canonical A-comodule structure of C.\nTherefore \u03c9C,C is always pure. Also for a right A-comodule (i.e. a right A-module) we can easily\n\u03b5C\nagain see that \u03c9N,A = 0, and therefore the (\u2217)-condition holds. Now if C \u2212\u2192\nA is Frobenius,\nby Theorem 1.5 we get \u03b1 : A \u2212\u2192 C an A-bimodule morphism and \u03b2 \u2208 C HomC (C \u2297 C, C) such\nthat equation (15) holds. Put \u03c0 = \u03b2 and e = \u03b1(1); then ae = a\u03b1(1) = \u03b1(a) = \u03b1(1)a = ea\nand \u03b1(a) = a\u03b1(1) = ae = ea. We get \u03c0(e \u2297 c) = \u03c0(e \u2297 \u03b5C (c1 )c2 ) = \u03c0(e\u03b5C (c1 ) \u2297A c2 ) =\n\u03b2(\u03b1(\u03b5C (c1 )) \u2297 c2 ) = c by (15) and similarly \u03c0(c \u2297 e) = e. Conversely if these conditions hold,\ndefine \u03b1 = (a 7\u2192 ae) and \u03b2 = \u03c0; then \u03b1 \u2208 A HomA (A, C) and by the same computation as\n\u03b5C\nabove we get that equation (15) holds. Therefore by Theorem 1.5 the extension C \u2212\u2192\nA is a\nFrobenius extension.\n\u0003\nFollowing [BW], if an A-coring C satisfies the condition in the above proposition, C is said to\nbe a Frobenius coring. By the above Proposition we see that this is a left-right symmetric\nconcept.\n\u03c6\nLet \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B be a morphism of rings. Recall that A \u2212\u2192 B is a Frobenius extension if\nB is a finitely generated projective left (equivalently right) A-module and B \u2243 HomA (B, A).\nThis is equivalent to the fact that the induced forgetful functor B M \u2212\u2192 A M is Frobenius,\nor\nP\nequivalently, there are E : B \u2212\u2192 A an A-bimodule morphism and an element h =\nhi \u2297 gi \u2208\ni\n\nB \u2297A B such that for all b \u2208 B we have\nX\nX\nhi E(gi b) = b\nE(bhi )gi =\ni\n\ni\n\n(we refer the reader to [K] for these equivalent conditions). In this case the element h is Binvariant, that is, bh = hb, \u2200 b \u2208 B. Then it is easy to see that the existence of h is equivalent\nto the existence of u \u2208B HomB (B, B \u2297 B), where u(b) = hb (and conversely, h = u(1)).\nThis comes from the isomorphism B HomB (B, B \u2297A B) \u2243 {h \u2208 B \u2297A B | bh = hb, \u2200 b \u2208 B},\nu 7\u2192 u(1) (see [BW], section 27, and [CMZ]). Therefore we can equivalently restate this as\n\u03c6\n\nProposition 2.5. The ring extension A \u2212\u2192 B is Frobenius if and only if there are E \u2208\nA HomA (B, A) and u \u2208 B HomB (B, B \u2297 B) such that\n(21)\n\n\u03bc \u25e6 (\u03c6E \u2297 1B ) \u25e6 u = \u03bc \u25e6 (1B \u2297 \u03c6E) \u25e6 u = 1B\n\nwhere \u03bc : B \u2297A B \u2212\u2192 B is the multiplication of B induced to B \u2297A B.\nRemark 2.6. By ([BW], 25.1, 27.7), if the extension \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B is Frobenius then B \u2297A B\nwith the canonical Sweedler B-coring structure given by comultiplication (b \u2297A b\u2032 ) 7\u2192 (b \u2297A\n1) \u2297B (1 \u2297A b\u2032 ) and counit b \u2297A b\u2032 7\u2192 bb\u2032 is a Frobenius coring. The converse also holds provided\nthat B is faithfully flat as left or right A-module.\nIn the case some restrictions are imposed on the base ring A, the restrictive conditions (\u2217) and\n\"\u03c9C,C is pure in A M\" can be eliminated. In particular, for extensions of coalgebras a theorem\ndual to the theorem characterizing Frobenius extensions of algebras (or rings, Proposition 2.5)\ncan be obtained.\n\u03bb\n\nExample 2.7. Extensions of coalgebras An extension of corings C \u2212\u2192 D with C, D\ncoalgebras over a commutative ring A will be called an extension of coalgebras.\nTheorem 2.8. Let A be a von Neumann regular ring (VNR). Then an extension of A-corings\n\u03bb\n\nC \u2212\u2192 D is (left or right) Frobenius if and only if there are \u03b1 \u2208\nC HomC (C\u0003 C, C) such that\nD\n\u03b2(c1 \u2297 \u03b1\u03bb(c2 )) = \u03b2(\u03b1\u03bb(c1 ) \u2297 c2 ) = c\n\nD HomD (D, C)\n\nand \u03b2 \u2208\n\n\f14\n\nMIODRAG CRISTIAN IOVANOV\n\nfor all c \u2208 C, equivalently,\n(22)\n\n\u03b2 \u25e6 (\u03b1\u03bb \u2297 1C ) \u25e6 \u2206 = \u03b2 \u25e6 (1C \u2297 \u03b1\u03bb) \u25e6 \u2206 = 1C\n\nIn particular this holds for extensions of coalgebras over fields.\nProof. If the base ring is VNR then all left and right modules are flat, and therefore the\nabove mentioned conditions can be deleted from Theorem 1.5. Therefore, by the symmetry of\nthe equation (15) the theorem becomes left-right symmetric too.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.9. Theorem 2.8 gives a characterization of Frobenius extension of corings over VNRrings (in particular of coalgebras over fields) which is completely dual to the characterization\nof Frobenius extensions of rings (and in particular of algebras over fields).\n\n3. Finiteness Theorems\nThe following proposition investigatesL\nwhen the coproduct of comodules on the category of\nD-comodules indexed by a set I, U = , is a Frobenius functor. As the coproduct functor is\ni\u2208I\n\na leftL\nadjoint to the diagonal functor \u03b4 : MD \u2212\u2192 (MD )I , this is equivalent to the fact that\nU=\nis also a right adjoint to \u03b4, that is, it is also the product (of families indexed by I) in\nthe category MD , and the product and coproduct are isomorphic.\n\u03bb\n\nProposition 3.1. The the extension of A-corings C \u2212\u2192 D from Example 2.1 with D 6= 0 is a\nFrobenius\n(left or right) if and only if the set I is finite. Consequently the coproduct\nLextension\non MC is Frobenius (and coincides with the product of comodules) if and only if I\nfunctor\nis finite.\n\nI\n\nProof. The statement follows from a result from [I1], namely Theorem 1.4, which shows that\nfor a preadditive (and even for a more general type of) category if the coproduct (or product,\nor equivalently the diagonal functor) indexed by a set I is a Frobenius functor then I is finite\n(provided such a coproduct exists). However we can also see this from the results in the present\npaper. If I is finite then it is easy to see that U is also the product of comodules, with the\nprojections being the canonical projections of the product of modules. To prove the converse,\nwe first note that the (\u2217) condition holds by Proposition 2.2. Then we can find \u03b1 and \u03b2 as\nin Theorem 1.5. With the notations of Example 2.1, let \u03b1i = pi \u25e6 \u03b1; then \u03b1i is a morphism\nin D MD because pi is too. First note that because \u03b2 is a morphism in MC , for d \u2208 D and\ni, j \u2208 I we have\n\u03b2(\u03c3j (d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 )) = \u03b5C (\u03b2(\u03c3j (d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 ))1 )\u03b2(\u03c3j (d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 ))2\n= \u03b5C (\u03b2(\u03c3j (d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 )))\u03c3i (d3 ) \u2208 \u03c3i (D)\n\n\fFROBENIUS EXTENSIONS OF CORINGS\n\n15\n\nand similarly, as \u03b2 is a morphism in C M we get \u03b2(\u03c3j (d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 )) \u2208 \u03c3j (D)\nP and therefore for\ni 6= j we obviously get \u03b2(\u03c3j (d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 )) = 0. Then for d \u2208 D as \u03b1(d) =\n\u03c3j \u03b1j (d) we get\nj\n\nd = \u03b2(\u03b1\u03bb(\u03c3i (d)1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d)2 ) (by (15))\n= \u03b2(\u03b1\u03bb(\u03c3i (d1 )) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 )) (definition of \u2206C )\n= \u03b2(\u03b1(d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 )) (definition of \u03bb)\nX\n=\n\u03b2(\u03c3j \u03b1j (d1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (d2 ))\nj\u2208I\n\n=\n\nX\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03b2(\u03c3j (\u03b1j (d)1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (\u03b1j (d)2 )) (as \u03b1j is a morphism in MD )\n\nj\u2208I\n\n\u03b4ij \u03b2(\u03c3j (\u03b1j (d)1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (\u03b1j (d)2 )) (where \u03b4ij is the Kroneker symbol)\n\nj\u2208I\n\n= \u03b2(\u03c3i (\u03b1i (d)1 ) \u2297 \u03c3i (\u03b1i (d)2 ))\nThis last equality obviously shows that for all i \u2208 I, \u03b1i is injective. But then for d \u2208 D, d 6= 0,\nwe have \u03b1i (d) 6= 0, \u2200 i \u2208 I and therefore I must be finite because the family (\u03b1i (d))i\u2208I \u2208 D (I)\nis of finite support.\n\u0003\nFor the coring extension of Example 2.3, by [BW], 27.9 we have\nProposition 3.2. If C is a Frobenius coring (that is, the extension of corings from example\n2.3 is Frobenius) then C is finitely generated projective as left and right A-module.\nFor extensions of coalgebras we can prove several interesting results parallel to existing ones\nfor the extensions of algebras, namely several finiteness properties. We first prove a general\nfiniteness theorem for Frobenius extensions of coalgebras. In what follows the ring A is a field\nK and the tensor product is always considered over K unless otherwise specified.\nTheorem 3.3. The Finiteness of a Frobenius extension of coalgebras Let C, D be two\n\u03bb\ncoalgebras over a commutative field K and C \u2212\u2192 D a Frobenius extension of coalgebras.

If C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension of coalgebras, then C is injective as\nleft and also as right D-comodule.\n\n\f18\n\nMIODRAG CRISTIAN IOVANOV\n\nProof. By the definition of Frobenius extensions, we have that the functor F = \u2212\u0003D C :\nMD \u2212\u2192 MC is Frobenius so it has the same left and right adjoint. As MC and MD are\nabelian categories, we get that F is left and right exact. Therefore by [DNR], 2.4.23 we have\nthat C is injective as left D-comodule. By Theorem 2.8 we have the left-right symmetry of\nFrobenius extensions of coalgebras and therefore we also get that C\u0003D \u2212 : D M \u2212\u2192 C M is a\nFrobenius functor and that C is also injective as right D-comodule.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.7. Let C \u2212\u2192 D be an extension of coalgebras with C finite dimensional. Then\nthe application \u03a6 : D HomD (D, C) \u220b \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 \u03a6(\u03b1) = \u03b1\u2217 \u2208 D\u2217 HomD\u2217 (C \u2217 , D \u2217 ) is well defined\nand bijective, where D HomD (D\u2217 HomD\u2217 ) represents the set of morphisms of D-bicomodules\n(respectively D \u2217 -bimodules).\nProof. It is not difficult to see that \u03a6 is injective, as if \u03b1\u2217 = 0, then c\u2217 (\u03b1(d)) = 0 for all\nd \u2208 D and c\u2217 \u2208 C \u2217 and therefore \u03b1(d) = 0, \u2200 d \u2208 D. Let u : C \u2217 \u2212\u2192 D \u2217 be a morphism of\nD \u2217 -bimodules. Then I = Im (u) is an ideal of D \u2217 of finite dimension and thus E = I \u22a5 = {d \u2208\nD | d\u2217 (d) = 0, \u2200 d\u2217 \u2208 I} is a subcoalgebra of D which has finite codimension as I is finite\ndimensional. We also have that I is closed in the finite topology on D \u2217 (for example, by [DNR],\nCorollary 1.2.12), so E \u22a5 = {d\u2217 \u2208 D \u2217 | d\u2217 (d) = 0, \u2200 d \u2208 E} = (I \u22a5 )\u22a5 = I. Let p : D \u2212\u2192 D/E\nbe the canonical projection, i : I \u0592\u2192 D \u2217 the inclusion morphism and v : C \u2217 \u2212\u2192 I the\ncorestriction of u.

But C and D/E are finite dimensional vector spaces and therefore there is\nq : D/E \u2212\u2192 C such that v = q \u2217 . Hence we obtain u = i\u25e6v = i\u25e6\u03b8 \u25e6v = p\u2217 \u25e6v = p\u2217 \u25e6q \u2217 = (q \u25e6p)\u2217 ,\nso u = \u03b1\u2217 for \u03b1 = q \u25e6 p.\nNow the following sequence of equivalences shows that \u03b1 is a D-bicomodule morphism if and\nonly if \u03b1\u2217 is a D \u2217 -bimodule morphism, and thus \u03a6 is well defined (denote by \u2217 the convolution\nproduct of C \u2217 ):\n(\n\n\u03b1(d1 ) \u2297 d2\nc (\u03b1(d1 ))d\u2217 (d2 )\n(\u03b1\u2217 (c\u2217 ) \u2217 d\u2217 )(d)\n\u03b1\u2217 (c\u2217 ) \u2217 d\u2217\n\u2217\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u03b1 is a morphism of right D \u2212 comodules \u21d4\n\u03b1(d)1 \u2297 \u03bb(\u03b1(d)2 ), \u2200 d \u2208 D \u21d4\nc\u2217 (\u03b1(d)1 )d\u2217 (\u03bb(\u03b1(d)2 )), \u2200 d \u2208 D, \u2200 c\u2217 \u2208 C \u2217 , \u2200 d\u2217 \u2208 D \u2217 \u21d4\n(c\u2217 \u2217 \u03bb\u2217 (d\u2217 ))(\u03b1(d)), \u2200 d \u2208 D, \u2200 c\u2217 \u2208 C \u2217 , \u2200 d\u2217 \u2208 D \u2217 \u21d4\n\u03b1\u2217 (c\u2217 * d\u2217 ), \u2200 c\u2217 \u2208 C \u2217 , \u2200 d\u2217 \u2208 D \u2217 \u21d4\n\u03b1\u2217 is a morphism of right D \u2217 \u2212 modules\n\n(and similarly \u03b1 is a morphism of left D-comodules if and only if \u03b1\u2217 is a morphism of left\nD \u2217 -modules.)\n\u0003\n\u03bb\n\nProposition 3.8.

Then by Lemma 3.5, as C \u2217 \u2297D\u2217 C \u2217 \u2243 (C\u0003D C)\u2217\nas C \u2217 -bimodules and (C\u0003D C)\u2217 and C \u2217 are finite dimensional, there is a morphism of Cbicomodules \u03b2 : C\u0003D C \u2212\u2192 C such that \u03b2 \u2217 = u. Also, by Proposition 3.7, E = \u03b1\u2217 with\n\u03b1 : D \u2212\u2192 C a morphism of D-bicomodules. Then by (21), c\u2217 = (\u2206\u2217 \u25e6 (\u03bb\u2217 \u03b1\u2217 \u2297 1C \u2217 ) \u25e6 \u03b2 \u2217 )(c\u2217 ) =\n(\u2206\u2217 \u25e6(\u03b1\u03bb\u22971C )\u2217 )(c\u2217 \u25e6\u03b2) = c\u2217 \u25e6\u03b2\u25e6(\u03b1\u03bb\u22971C )\u25e6\u2206 for all c\u2217 \u2208 C \u2217 and therefore \u03b2\u25e6(\u03b1\u03bb\u22971C )\u25e6\u2206 = 1C\n\u03bb\n\nand similarly \u03b2 \u25e6 (1C \u2297 \u03b1\u03bb) \u25e6 \u2206 = 1C . Thus (22) holds and C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension\nof coalgebras.\nFinally if (i) and (ii) hold, by Proposition 3.6 C is injective in MD (and also in D M), so there\nis a monomorphism of right (left) C \u0592\u2192 D (I) for a set I. But as C is finite dimensional, we may\nobviously assume that the set I is finite. Thus we get C \u0592\u2192 D n as right (or left) D-comodules\n\u03bb\u2217\n\nfor some n \u2208 N, and in fact C is a direct summand of D n as it is injective. Also as D \u2217 \u2212\u2192 C \u2217\nis a Frobenius extension of rings we get that C \u2217 is finitely generated and projective as right\n(and also as left) D \u2217 -module (or as C splits off in some D n ).\n\u0003\n\u03bb\n\nProposition 3.9. Assume C \u2212\u2192 D is an extension of coalgebras with D finite dimensional.\nThen the following are equivalent:\n\u03bb\n\n(i) C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension of coalgebras.\n\u03bb\u2217\n\n(ii) D \u2217 \u2212\u2192 C \u2217 is a Frobenius extension of algebras.\nIn this case C is finite dimensional and injective finitely cogenerated as right (and also as left)\nD-comodule and C \u2217 is finitely generated as left (and also as right) D \u2217 -module.\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii) By Theorem 3.3 we get that C is finite dimensional as D is. Then MC\ncoincides with C \u2217 M and MD with D\u2217 M, as any C \u2217 (D \u2217 )-module is in this case a C (D)comodule. Note that in this case the corestriction functor U : MC \u2212\u2192 MD induced by \u03bb\nidentifies with the forgetful functor H : C \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 D\u2217 M. Indeed if (M, \u03c1M ) \u2208 MC , then\nM \u2208 MD by the coaction m 7\u2192 m0 \u2297 \u03bb(m1 ) where m0 \u2297 m1 = \u03c1M (m). Then M becomes\na left D \u2217 -module by d\u2217 * m = m0 d\u2217 (\u03bb(m1)) for m \u2208 M and d\u2217 \u2208 D \u2217 . But then d\u2217 * m =\nm0 \u03bb\u2217 (d\u2217 )(m1 ) = \u03bb\u2217 (d\u2217 ) * m which shows that the D \u2217 -module structure of M coincides with\n\u03bb\n\nthe one obtained through the forgetful functor H. Therefore, if C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius\nextension, U is a Frobenius functor and therefore H is Frobenius, proving (ii).\n\u03bb\u2217\n\n(ii)\u21d2(i) If D \u2217 \u2212\u2192 C \u2217 is Frobenius then C \u2217 must be finitely generated (and projective) as\nright (and also as left) D \u2217 -module and as D \u2217 is finite dimensional, we get that C is finite\ndimensional too. Then as in (i)\u21d2(ii) we obtain that the induced functor U is Frobenius and\n\u03bb\n\ntherefore C \u2212\u2192 D is a Frobenius extension.\nThe last statement follows easily as in the proof of Proposition 3.8.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f20\n\nMIODRAG CRISTIAN IOVANOV\n\nRemark 3.10. It can be seen that in a wide range of situations whenever a functor is Frobenius,\na certain finiteness theorem holds. Then it is natural to ask whether a general theorem can be\nproved; that is, given a Frobenius pair (F, G) between two abelian categories (or Grothendieck,\nor with other additional properties) is there a finiteness property that holds for this general\ncontext and which generalizes all these theorems regarding Frobenius extensions of (co)rings?\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe author wishes to thank his Ph.D. adviser C.
