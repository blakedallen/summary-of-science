Box 20-8286, New Haven, CT 06520\n(Dated: October 22, 2018)\nSimulations of over 103 hydrodynamically coupled solid spheres are performed to investigate\ncollective motion of linear trains and regular square arrays of particles suspended in a fluid bounded\nby two parallel walls. Our novel accelerated Stokesian-dynamics algorithm relies on simplifications\nassociated with the Hele\u2013Shaw asymptotic far-field form of the flow scattered by the particles. The\nsimulations reveal propagation of particle-displacement waves, deformation and rearrangements of\na particle lattice, propagation of dislocation defects in ordered arrays, and long-lasting coexistence\nof ordered and disordered regions.\n\nLong-range hydrodynamic interactions between solid\nparticles suspended in a fluid result in complex collective\ndynamic phenomena, such as development of ordered arrays of magnetically driven rotors placed on a liquid interface [1] and formation of time-dependent patterns in\na system of particles immersed in a vibrated fluid [2].\nCollective behavior due to the hydrodynamic coupling\nalso occurs in biological systems. A striking example is\nspontaneous formation of vortical arrays of self-propelled\nsperm cells confined to an interface [3]. Hydrodynamic\ncoupling also plays an essential role in the synchronization of cilia beating and development of collective waves\nin cilia arrays in small swimming organisms [4].\nIn confined multiphase systems, the collective particle\nbehavior is strongly influenced by bounding walls affecting the fluid motion. According to recent studies [5, 6, 7],\nhydrodynamic confinement effects are especially significant in parallel-wall channels of width comparable to the\nparticle size. Lateral motion of a particle in such a channel produces fluid backflow that is involved in numerous dynamical phenomena. It enhances relative particle\nmotion in confined quasi-2D-suspensions [5, 6], considerably increases transverse hydrodynamic resistance for\nelongated rigid arrays of spheres moving parallel to the\nchannel walls [6], and governs propagation of particledisplacement waves [7] in linear arrays of drops in a microfluidic channel. We show that the fluid backflow resulting from particle motion is also responsible for pattern formation occurring in 2D hydrodynamic crystals\n(i.e. regular particle arrays that are hydrodynamically\ndriven).\nIn this Letter we present a numerical study of the dynamics of 1D and 2D regular arrays of hydrodynamically\ncoupled spherical particles in parallel-wall channels (cf.\nconfigurations shown in Fig. 1). We investigate propagation of displacement waves in linear arrays. In large\nsquare 2D arrays we report emergence of striking patterns, such as rearrangements of particle lattice, dislocation defects, and coexistence of ordered and disordered\ndomains. We show that these patterns occur as a result\nof macroscopic deformation of a regular particle lattice,\nand we propose a macroscopic theory describing shape\n\nevolution of the arrays.\nOur simulations are performed using a novel accelerated Stokesian-dynamics algorithm to follow evolution of\nabout 103 particles. Potential applications of our new\nalgorithm include studies of collective motion of selfpropelled particles (e.g. bacterial colonies) in liquid films,\nmodeling suspension flows in slit pores, and investigations of dynamics of macromolecules (e.g. DNA or polymer chains) in microfluidic channels. Our acceleration\ntechnique can also be used in boundary-integral algorithms for studying dynamics of deformable particles in\nconfined geometry.\nOur numerical technique relies on simplifications associated with the far-field asymptotics of the flow scattered\nfrom the particles. Far from a particle, the scattered flow\nin a parallel-wall channel assumes the Hele\u2013Shaw form,\ni.e. it tends to a 2D parabolic flow that is driven by a\nharmonic pressure distribution [6]. In our new approach\nwe expand the flow scattered by the particles into a carefully chosen fundamental set of Stokes flows. Close to a\nparticle the basis flows form a complete set of solutions\nof Stokes equations in 3D space.

The expansion of the flow field\ninto the new set of basis fields (obtained by an orthogonal transformation from the fields used in [6]) yields\na sparse system of linear equations, which can be efficiently solved using iterative sparse-matrix-manipulation\ntechniques. Moreover, since the far-field flow is uniquely\ndetermined by the harmonic pressure distribution, welldeveloped acceleration techniques for Laplace equation\ncan be applied to further increase numerical efficiency.\nThe simulations discussed below show that our algorithm\nis efficient and highly accurate in both the far-field and\nthe near-field regimes. The calculations also reveal surprisingly rich collective particle dynamics.\nFigures 2 and 3 present our results for propagation of\nparticle displacement waves in an infinite train of equally\nspaced particles positioned along a line in the midplane\nof a channel slightly wider than the particle size. The\nparticle array is driven either by Poiseuille flow [cf. Fig.\n1(a)] or by a constant external lateral force. We focus on\nthe longitudinal waves, where the particle displacements\n\u03b4xi from the reference positions xi = iW (i = 0, 1, 2 . . .)\non a regular lattice with spacing W occur along the array\n[cf. Fig. 1(b)].\nFigure 2 shows the dispersion relation \u03c9 = \u03c9(k) for\nharmonic displacement waves \u03b4xi = \u01eb sin(kxi \u2212 \u03c9t) in\narrays with different interparticle spacing. Here k is the\nwave number, \u03c9 is the wave frequency measured in the\nreference frame moving with the particles, and \u01eb \u226a 1 is\nthe wave amplitude. The time and frequency are normalized by the time \u03c40 in which an isolated particle in a\nchannel moves by the diameter d. The shape of the dispersion curves is reflected in the evolution of wave packets depicted in Fig. 3.

Hence, there is a long-wave tail in the\nwave packet shown in Fig. 3(c).\nIn Fig. 2 the frequency \u03c9 is plotted rescaled by a factor\n(W/d)3 to emphasize the universal behavior of the system\nfor large values of W . In addition, the results for the\nforce-driven train are multiplied by a constant negative\nfactor \u03b1. We find that for W/d & 5 all rescaled results\nfall onto a single asymptotic master curve. In the regime\nW/d \u2248 2\u20133 the dispersion relations significantly deviate\nfrom the master curve, but the scaled results for the flowand force-driven arrays are still nearly identical. Since\nthe scale factor \u03b1 is negative, this behavior indicates that\nfor moderate and large interparticle distances the relative\nparticle motion in an array driven by an external flow is\nequivalent to the relative motion in a force-driven array\nmoving in the opposite direction.\nThe above features of the system dynamics result from\nthe far-field behavior of the flow field scattered by the\nparticles. In the far-field regime an isolated particle subject to Poiseuille flow or external force produces the same\nHele\u2013Shaw flow vHS driven by the two-dimensional dipolar pressure pHS \u223c cos \u03c6/\u03c1 (where \u03c6 is the polar angle measured from the direction of the external forcing)\n[5, 6]. For W/d & 5 the single-scattering approximation\ncorresponding to the superposition of dipolar fields vHS\nadequately describes the system dynamics (and thus the\nrescaled results in Fig. 2 follow a single master curve). In\nthe regime W/d \u2248 2\u20133 evaluation of a single flow reflection is insufficient; nevertheless, the results for flow- and\n\n\f35\n(a)\n\nt = 525\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n(b)\n\nt = 525\n\nt = 930\n\n(f )\n\nt = 930\n\n(g)\n\nt = 1360\n\n(c)\nt = 1360\n\narray [cf. Fig. 1(c)] of about 103 particles undergoing\ndiagonal motion produced by a constant force acting on\nall the particles. The initial particle spacing is within the\nfar-field asymptotic regime, W/d = 5. Figure 5 shows\ncorresponding results for lateral motion of the array.\nOur simulations demonstrate that at short times a deforming square array retains its initial particle ordering\n[cf. Fig. 4(a)]. Subsequently, the system develops some\nstriking structural features. Several rows of particle pairs\nseparate from the main body of the array, forming a\nshape similar to airplane wings. The front part of the\narray has an approximately hexagonal particle ordering,\nand the middle part retains the square ordering. The\nrear part [marked region in Fig. 4(c)] has a square particle arrangement but with a different orientation than\nthe original one. The blowup in Fig. 4(e\u2013g) shows that\nthe particle rearrangement involves discontinuous particle displacements along a \"fault line\" at the symmetry\naxis of the array. A similar dislocation event (but without lattice reorientation) is observed in an array in the\nlateral motion (cf. Fig. 5). There also occur instabilities responsible for emergence of disordered domains of\nchaotic particle motion. In the diagonal motion [Fig.\n4(b,c)] the instability starts at the junction between the\nwings and the body of the array.

This\nis because the first reflection in the multiple-scattering\nsequence for the two systems is nearly identical (apart\nfrom a rescaling factor), owing to the exponential approach of the flow field to the asymptotic Hele\u2013Shaw\nform vHS . With matching initial reflections, the whole\nmultiple-scattering sequences for systems with different\nforcing coincide, and the relative particle motion is thus\nthe same. This argument is valid not only for linear arrays but also for other horizontal particle arrangements\n(such as the 2D arrays shown in Figs. 4\u20136). Moreover,\nsimilar reasoning applies to different kinds of forcing,\nincluding Marangoni and electrophoretic forces used to\ncontrol particle positions in microfluidic devices.\nRich collective phenomena revealed by our simulations\nof 2D hydrodynamic crystals are illustrated in Figs. 4\u2013\n6.

Moreover, the ordered crystalline domains can\nrearrange and heal themselves along fault or dislocation\nlines. The strong propensity to maintain the ordered\nstructure results from the dipolar hydrodynamic interactions of neighboring particles. An array also undergoes\na macroscopic deformation resulting from the combined\nlong-range effect of the dipolar flow fields produced by\nindividual particles.\nFor low-density arrays (i.e. for W/d \u226b 1) the macroscopic flow that causes the deformation can be determined from the flow field produced by a uniform distribution of pressure dipoles pHS induced in the array. In\ngeneral, the macroscopic deformation can be described\nusing the effective 2D transport equations for suspension\nflow in a parallel-wall channel, u = \u2212\u03bdp \u2207p\u0304 + \u03bdf f , and\njp = \u2212\u03bcp \u2207p\u0304 + \u03bcf f . Here u is the suspension velocity averaged across the channel, jp is the particle flux, f denotes\nthe density of the lateral force acting on the particles, p\u0304\nis the macroscopic pressure, and \u03bd\u03b1 , \u03bc\u03b1 (\u03b1 = p, f ) are\nlinear transport coefficients. The suspension velocity and\nsuspension flux satisfy the continuity equations \u2207 * u = 0\nand \u2202 \u03c1\u0304/\u2202t = \u2212\u2207 * jp , where \u03c1\u0304 is the suspension density.\nThe macroscopic deformation of an array, evaluated\nin the uniform-dipolar-moment approximation, is shown\nin Figs. 4(d ) and 5(c). The results indicate that our\nmacroscopic description reproduces the overall shape of\nthe arrays for moderate times (i.e. before the complex\nstructural features develop).\nWe note that the macroscopic equations predict fingering instabilities near the array corners. In low-density\narrays (cf. Figs. 4 and 5) such instabilities are suppressed\ndue to the array \"stiffness\" associated with its ordered\nstructure. However, for denser arrays (cf. Fig. 6) the\nmacroscopic deforming forces are sufficiently strong to\ndestabilize the tips of the array wings, in agreement with\nour macroscopic theory. The results in Fig. 6 indicate\nthat the lengthscale for the fingering instability in par-\n\nticle arrays is determined by the particle lattice. In our\neffective medium theory there is no intrinsic lengthscale,\nso the size of the fingers in Figs. 4(d ) and 5(c) is set by\nthe initial condition (i.e. a square with rounded corners).\nThe patterns we observe in 2D hydrodynamic crystals have analogies in other athermal systems. For example, dislocations and chaotic dynamics develop in arrays of convective cells in a fluid undergoing Benard\nconvection [8] and in vibrated granular media [9]. Our\nsystem has a number of interesting distinctive features.\nFirst, the pattern formation occurs in the linear Stokesflow regime, and the nonlinearity stems entirely from the\nposition-dependence of the multiparticle mobility matrix.\nNext, the dipolar hydrodynamic interactions that maintain particle ordering are non-isotropic (causing, e.g., lattice reorientation). Finally, the dipolar flow vHS not only\nmaintains the ordered structure on the local level but also\nproduces the macroscopic deformation of the array, leading to lattice instabilities.\nRegular particle arrays can be assembled using holographic optical tweezers [10], so the collective dynamic\nphenomena revealed by our study should be accessible\nexperimentally. The effect of hydrodynamic coupling on\nthe motion of regular particle arrays could also be observed in flow-driven 2D colloidal crystals. The equivalence of the relative particle motion in systems with\ndifferent forcing can be used to separately control the\nrelative particle positions and the position of the center\nof mass of an array.\nThis work was supported by NSF CAREER grant\nCBET-0348175 and MNiSW grant N501 020 32/1994.\n\n\u2217\nOn leave from IPPT Warsaw, Poland.\n[1] B.
