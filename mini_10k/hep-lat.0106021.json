The monopoles\nare topological defects which appear due to the compactness of the gauge group. In three\ndimensions the monopoles are instanton\u2013like.\nThe confining property of the model is lost at sufficiently high temperature. The\nconfinement\u2013deconfinement phase transition - which is expected [3, 4, 5] to be of Kosterlitz\u2013Thouless type [6] - was studied on the lattice both analytically [5] and numerically [4]. A thorough numerical analysis of the phase transition was done in Ref. [7]\nwhere it has been demonstrated that the monopoles are sensitive to the transition. In\nthe confinement phase the monopoles are observed in the plasma state while in the deconfinement phase the monopoles appear in the form of a dilute gas of magnetic dipoles.\nSimilarly to the monopole plasma the dipole vacuum, although not confining, still has a\nnon\u2013perturbative nature [8]. In the confinement phase both monopole density and string\ntension differ from semiclassical estimates [1] which neglect monopole binding. However,\nan analysis of monopole clusters shows that the relation between the string tension and\nthe density of monopoles in magnetically charged clusters is in reasonable agreement with\nthose predictions.\nAn alternative explanation of the deconfinement phase transition, based on Svetitsky\u2013Yaffe universality arguments [3], was given in Refs. [4, 5]. The phase transition was\ndemonstrated to be accompanied by restructuring of the U(1) vortex system in an effective\n2D Abelian spin model. In the confinement (low temperature) phase the vortices exist in\nthe plasma state while in the deconfinement (high temperature) phase the vortices and\nanti\u2013vortices form bound states. Both monopole [9] and vortex [10] binding mechanisms\nhave been studied in the context of the Georgi\u2013Glashow model, too, a limiting case of\nwhich is the compact Abelian gauge model.\nIn this paper we continue to consider the deconfining mechanism by monopole pairing\nwhich seems to have interesting counterparts in realistic gauge theories. The formation of\nmonopole pairs is qualitatively similar to the binding of instantons in instanton molecules\nwith increasing temperature in QCD suggested to be responsible for chiral symmetry\nrestoration [11]. An external magnetic field affects the phase diagram of the non-Abelian\ntheory as was shown both analytically [12] and numerically [13]. In the electroweak theory,\nthe formation of Nambu monopole-anti\u2013monopole pairs, a remnant from a dense medium\nof disordered Z\u2013vortices and Nambu monopoles which characterizes the high temperature\nphase, is accompanying the transition towards the low temperature phase [14]. The effects\nof the external fields on the phase transition temperature and the electroweak baryogenesis\nin the electroweak theory were discussed in Ref. [15].\nIn three dimensional gauge theories the inclusion of external fields allows to study the\nvacuum energy density in the SU(2) gauge theory [16], vortex dynamics in the Abelian\nHiggs model [17] and dynamically generated fermion mass in the Abelian gauge theory\nwith fermionic [18] fields. Here we study the influence of the external electromagnetic\nfield on the confining and monopole properties of the compact Abelian gauge model in\nthree dimensions.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe the basics of the lattice\n2\n\n\fformulation of the compact U(1) model in 2 + 1 dimensions and how the external field is\nimplemented. The screening of the external electric and magnetic fields and the properties\nof the Polyakov loop correlators in the presence of those fields are studies in Section 3.\nDifferences and similarities between magnetic and electric fields are stressed. The string\ntension in the presence of the external fields with a flux next is investigated in Section 4\nand the phase diagrams in the next \u2212 \u03b2 plane are presented in Section 5, separately\nfor magnetic and electric fields. In the case of an applied electric field we see that the\nso\u2013called \"bulk Polyakov loop\" cannot play any longer the usual role in localizing the\ndeconfining transition. Results for various monopole properties are collected in Section 6.\nOur conclusions are summarized in the last Section.\n\n2\n\nThe compact lattice model in external fields\n\nWe study 2 + 1 dimensional compact lattice electrodynamics in constant external electromagnetic fields. Following Ref. [19] we use the action\nS[\u03b8, \u03b8ext ] = \u2212\u03b2\n\nX\np\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ncos \u03b8p \u2212 \u03b8pext ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8p is the U(1) field strength tensor represented by the curl of the compact link\nfield \u03b8l , and \u03b8pext is the field strength corresponding to the external field. \u03b2 is the lattice\ncoupling constant related to the lattice spacing a and the continuum coupling constant\ng3 of the 3D theory as follows:\n\u03b2=\n\n1\n.\na g32\n\n(2)\n\nAt finite temperature the lattice is asymmetric, L2s \u00d7 Lt , Lt < Ls ; L1 = L2 = Ls and\nL3 = Lt are the spatial and temporal extensions of the lattice, respectively. In the limit\nLs \u2192 \u221e the temporal extension of the lattice Lt is related to the physical temperature,\nLt = 1/(T a). Using eq. (2) the temperature is given via the lattice parameters as follows:\nT\n\u03b2\n=\n.\n2\ng3\nLt\n\n(3)\n\nNote that in 2 + 1 dimensions there is no symmetry anymore between the three components of the field strength tensor. The closest relative of the true magnetic field is\nF12 distinct from the others, while there is still a symmetry between F13 and F23 . With\nthis distinction in mind one can conditionally call them the \"magnetic\" and \"electric\"\ncomponents of the field strength tensor, respectively. As long as one does not introduce\nexternal fields, even at finite temperature there was no need to distinguish between them.\nWithout loss of generality we represent an external electric field E as a field directly\ncoupled via (1) to plaquettes lying in the 31 plane. The value of the field is quantized [19]:\next\nE = \u03b831\n=\n\n2\u03c0nE\n,\nL1 L3\n\nnE \u2208 ZZ ,\n3\n\next\next\n\u03b812\n= \u03b823\n= 0.\n\n(4)\n\n\fTo study the influence of a magnetic field (and to draw parallels to analogous studies in\n4D [20]) we implement a magnetic field B as a field directly coupled via (1) to plaquettes\nlying in the 12 plane,\next\nB = \u03b812\n=\n\n2\u03c0nM\n,\nL1 L2\n\nnM \u2208 ZZ ,\n\next\next\n\u03b831\n= \u03b823\n= 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThe quantization of the external fields (4), (5) is necessary to match with the periodic\nboundary conditions imposed on the lattice [19]. Indeed, these conditions imply that the\nrectangular Wilson loop of the size Li \u00d7 Lj in the ij plane must be equal to unity. On the\nother hand the Wilson loop is equal to exp{i\u03a6}, where \u03a6 is the flux going through the ij\nplane. Therefore, we get the quantization condition for the flux, \u03a6 = 2\u03c0next , next \u2208 ZZ,\nwhich implies in turn the relations (4), (5) for the constant electric or magnetic field,\nrespectively. We use the notation nE/M instead of next where we want to emphasize the\nelectric/magnetic nature of the external field.\nNaturally, from the form of the action (1) the number of external fluxes is restricted,\n0 < next < Li Lj /2. In our analysis we restrict that number to 0 < next < Li Lj /4. One\nshould note however, that the largest considered fluxes correspond to lattice artifacts.\nIndeed, the physical electromagnetic field must have a strength smaller than the scale\ncorresponding to the lattice ultraviolet cutoff, a\u22122 . This leads to the restriction of the\nlattice field strength: \u03b8ext \u226a 1, or, next \u226a nmax = [Li Lj /(2\u03c0)], to avoid too large external\nfields.\nAs in the case of zero field [7] we restrict ourselves to a finite temperature lattice 322 \u00d78\nvarying the strength of the constant external electric or magnetic field and considering\nthe lattice gauge coupling range 0.1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 3. For this particular lattice size we get the\nupper bounds for the electric and magnetic fields: nmax\n= 40 and nmax\nE\nM = 163, respectively.\nFrom our studies at zero external fields we [7] found the deconfinement phase transition\nat \u03b2c = 2.346(2) using the Polyakov loop susceptibility in satisfactory agreement with\nRef. [4].\nWe briefly recall the Monte Carlo algorithm used and described already in Ref. [7]. The\nalgorithm combines a local Monte Carlo step with a global refreshment step to improve\nergodicity. The local Monte Carlo algorithm is based on a 5\u2013hit Metropolis update sweep\nfollowed by a microcanonical sweep. Following Ref. [19], the global refreshment step\nconsists of an attempt to add an additional unit of flux of randomly chosen direction and\nsign (i.e. adding a gauge field \u03b8\u0303i constructed over the whole lattice to the previous one,\n\u03b8i \u2192 [\u03b8i + \u03b8\u0303i ]mod2\u03c0 , subject to a global Metropolis acceptance check. The acceptance rate\nfor a global update does not depend on the external flux next and it is roughly equal for\nglobal shifts of the electric or magnetic flux. However, it changes with \u03b2, reducing from\n0.58 . . . 0.6 at \u03b2 = 1.0 to 0.18 . . . 0.20 at \u03b2 = 2.9.\n\n3\n\nPolyakov loop correlators and screening\n\nUsually, the Polyakov loop\nn ZLt\n\nL(x) = exp i\n\ndt A0 (x, t)\n\n0\n\n4\n\no\n\n(6)\n\n\fis used as a the basic quantity to probe the confining properties. The integration runs\nalong a loop l~x parallel to the time axis and located at the spatial 2D coordinate x. The\nPolyakov loop operator inserts an infinitely heavy test particle with unit electric charge\ninto the vacuum of the theory. The v.e.v. of this operator expresses the free energy\nF of the inserted particle, hL(R)i = exp(\u2212F/T ) and is an order parameter to signal\ndeconfinement.\nIn the absence of an external field the correlation function between two Polyakov\nloops can be expressed via the interaction potential V (R) between infinitely heavy electric\ncharge and anti\u2013charge:\nhL(0)L\u2217 (R)i \u221d exp{\u2212Lt V (R)} .\n\n(7)\n\nThe leading behavior of the potential V (R) in the low temperature phase corresponds to\na linearly rising potential, V (R) = \u03c3 R, where \u03c3 is the tension of the string between the\ntest electric charges separated by the distance R = |R|. In the high temperature phase\nthe potential is of Coulomb type (it rises logarithmically with increasing distance between\ntest particles).\nNow we discuss the Polyakov loop correlations in both electric and magnetic external\nfields. We introduce a 3D vector combining electric and magnetic components by\nF~ = (F23 , F31 , F12 ) = (Ex , Ey , Bz ) .\n\n(8)\n\nAs we will immediately see, an external (constant) electric field substantially modifies the\nbehavior of the Polyakov loop correlator (7) already on the tree level.\nIndeed, the electromagnetic field inside the medium can be decomposed into two parts,\nint\n~\nF + F~ q . Here F~ int is the mean field inside the medium, which is non\u2013zero due to the\npresence of the external electromagnetic field. The field F~ q corresponds to the quantum\nfluctuations around the mean value F~ int .

(1)\ncorresponding to non\u2013zero external flux.\nThe correlator (10) is taken over quantum fluctuations only, as indicated by the superscript q. Note that by definition the field Aq fluctuates near the minimum of the action.\n~ ext ) \u221d \u2212 log G(R, F~ ext )/Lt must\nThus negative modes are absent and the potential V (R; F\nbe real. The dynamics of the monopoles affects the quantum fluctuations and consequently\n5\n\n\fthe potential V . The external fields disturb the monopole medium and therefore we may\nexpect that in general the inter\u2013particle potential V may get influenced by the external\nfluxes.\nSummarizing, the quantum average of the Polyakov loop in the presence of the external\nconstant electromagnetic field is given by the following formula:\nhL(0)L\u2217 (R)iF~ ext \u221d exp i\u03a6C (F~ int ) \u2212 Lt V (R; F~ ext ) ,\nn\n\no\n\n(12)\n\nwhere a non\u2013vanishing flux \u03a6C (F~ int ) pierces the surface \u03a3C spanned by the contour C and\nthe trajectories of the test particles are placed along the (temporal) z\u2013direction.\nThe properties of the internal fields inside the system are important to understand\nthe behavior of the Polyakov loop correlators. For external fields given by eqs. (4), (5)\nthe total external fluxes through the corresponding planes are quantized. Analogously,\nthe internal electric or magnetic fluxes through any plane in any gauge field configuration\nare quantized as well (the considerations similar to those in Section 2 are applicable in\nthis case as well). Note that the global update step is consistent with the internal flux\nquantization since the update allows to change the total flux of the system by just one\nunit.\nFrom now on we study only two possibilities for the external field, an electric field in\ny direction and magnetic field in z direction,\nF~ ext = (0, E, 0) ,\n\nor F~ ext = (0, 0, B)\n\n(13)\n\nIt is clear that only the electric component contributes to the flux \u03a6C (F~ int ) in eq. (12).\nIn our case the mean internal electric and magnetic fields which are the actual average\nfields present in the medium are given by h\u03b831 i and h\u03b812 i, respectively, where\nh\u03b8ik i = h\n\n1 X\n[\u03b8~x,ik ]mod2\u03c0 i .\nL2s Lt ~x\n\n(14)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nnE=4\nnE=32\n\n0.4\n\nnE=64\n\n0.2\n0\n\n<\u03b812>/B\n\n<\u03b831>/E\n\nFollowing Ref.

One can see that in\nthe confinement phase the internal fields are much weaker than the external fields while in\nthe deconfinement phase the internal and external fields almost coincide with each other.\nThe measured average internal fields in the directions transverse to the applied external\nfield remain zero.\nThe attenuation of the external fields in the confinement phase resulting in weaker\naverage fields in the medium happens due to the monopole plasma [1] and can be called\nscreening: the monopoles produce a finite correlation length \u03be. If we would apply an\nexternal field to the box with the monopole plasma using frozen boundary conditions\nthen the field would be greatly suppressed inside the media at distances (from the box\nboundaries) larger than \u03be. Thus the averaged field inside the box with the plasma should\nbe smaller than the external field. The smaller the correlation length the smaller the\naveraged field inside the media should be.\nAs the temperature increases the monopoles form more and more magnetic dipole\nbound states. In the dipole plasma the screening is absent [22] and the correlation length\nis infinite. The internal field is expected to be equal to the external one what is clearly seen\nin Figures 1 for external fields of small strength. Moreover, the screening of the external\nmagnetic and electric field with the same strength (related to each other as nE = nM /\n4 due to difference in the lattice extensions in spatial and temporal directions) is very\nsimilar for weak external fields. This happens because the nature of the monopoles is\nnot purely \"magnetic\" at finite temperature. At large magnetic fields the response of the\nmedia is different in magnetic and electric cases. In Section 6 we show that the observed\nfeatures of the screening are qualitatively related to specific properties of the monopoles\nand their bound states.\nLet us consider the properties of the correlator (12) on a lattice of finite size for a non\u2013\nvanishing external electric field E using the lattice Polyakov loop at position x = (x, y)\nL(x) = exp i\n\nLt\nX\n\n!\n\n\u03b83 (x, z) .\n\nz=1\n\n(15)\n\nWe put the test charge and anti\u2013charge at the points (0, 0) and (x, y), respectively. The\nfluxes \u03a6C (\u03b831 ) going through the surface \u03a3C spanned between the test particle trajectories\ndepend on the internal electric field \u03b831 , they are quantized and peaked around an average\nvalue. Therefore, they can adequately be described by taking into account only the\n\"most probable\" flux state labeled by the integer nint = nint (next , \u03b2, Li ) which depends\non the strength of the external field, temperature and lattice geometry. In that case\n\u03a6C = 2\u03c0 nint x /Ls and Eint = h\u03b831 i = 2\u03c0nint /(Ls Lt ). The Polyakov loop correlator reads\nas follows,\nn\n\nhL(0, 0) L\u2217(x, y)iE \u221d exp 2\u03c0inint\n\no\nx\n\u2212 Lt V (x, y; E) ,\nLs\n\n(16)\n\nwith the oscillating part of the correlator defined by the electric component of the internal\nfield.\nEq. (16) simultaneously characterizes both the screening of the external field (phase\nfactor) and the potential of the test electric charges (modulus). We expect that in the\n7\n\n\fdeconfinement phase the external field is not screened and the correlator is dominated by\nnint \u2248 nE . In the confinement phase the field must be screened and nint becomes smaller\nwith decreasing \u03b2 (temperature).\nThus the Polyakov correlator in the deconfinement phase is an oscillating sign\u2013changing quantity at fixed y coordinate as function of the x coordinate. The maxima of the\noscillations become damped with increasing x due to the Coulombic interaction between\nthe test particles.\nThe correlations at fixed x and changing y should be of the same sign and decay with\nincreasing y. This behavior is nicely illustrated by the (real part of) the Polyakov loop\ncorrelators (16) in the x \u2212 y plane shown in Figure 2(a) for the deconfinement phase.

Thus the correlator\ngo to zero rapidly\n\u221a 2 must\n2\nwith increasing distance between charge and anti\u2013charge, x + y . The corresponding\ncorrelator, presented in Figure 2(b) at \u03b2 = 2.0, shows the expected suppression. In\naddition, we observe a small local maximum at x \u2248 8 and y = 0 arising from a flux of\nvalue nint close to 4 in agreement with the behavior of the internal fields in Figure 1 for\nthis relatively large \u03b2 value.\nFinally, let us comment here that an induced internal magnetic field (parallel to its\nparental external field) which is directed along the Polyakov loop cannot contribute to\nthe \"classical\" phase \u03a6C and, therefore, oscillations cannot appear. Thus, in an external\nmagnetic field, the correlator is rapidly approaching zero with increasing spatial distance.\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nString tension in the presence of fields\n\nAccording to Ref. [23] the point\u2013point correlation of the two Polyakov loops in the absence\nof an external field can be parametrized as followsa :\nhL(x1 , y1)L\u2217 (x2 , y2 )i = const *\n\nX\np1,2\n\neip1 (x1 \u2212x2 )+ip2 (y1 \u2212y2 )\n+ ... ,\n1 \u2212 cos p1 \u2212 cos p2 + cosh(\u03c3Lt )\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the sum runs over all possible momenta, p1,2 = 0, . . . , 2\u03c0(Ls \u2212 1)/Ls and \u03c3 denotes\nthe \"temporal\" string tension.\nTo evaluate the string tension, we use two Polyakov \"plane\" operators which are\ndefined as a sum over Polyakov loop positions along and perpendicular to the external\nfield. As an example we take the electric field in y direction. Then\nLk (x) =\n\nLs\nX\n\nL(x, y) ,\n\nL\u22a5 (y) =\n\nLs\nX\n\nL(x, y) .\n\n(18)\n\nx=1\n\ny=1\n\nThe correlator of the plane\u2013plane correlators may be written as a sum over the corresponding positions of the point\u2013point correlation functions,\nhLk (0)L\u2217k (x)i =\nhL\u22a5 (0)L\u2217\u22a5 (y)i =\n\nLs\nX\n\ny1,2 =1\nLs\nX\n\nhL(0, y1)L\u2217 (x, y2 )i ,\n\n(19)\n\nhL(x1 , 0)L\u2217 (x2 , y)i .\n\n(20)\n\nx1,2 =1\n\nIn the presence of an electric field E along the y axis this correlator must be modified\nin accordance with our discussion in Section 3\nhL(x1 , y1)L\u2217 (x2 , y2 )i \u2192 hL(x1 , y1 )L\u2217 (x2 , y2 )iE\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx1 \u2212 x2\n= exp \u22122\u03c0inint\nhL(x1 , y1)L\u2217 (x2 , y2 )iqnE .\nLs\n\n(21)\n\nThe subscript nE indicates that the Polyakov loops are calculated in the state with an\nexternal electric flux nE in the y direction. The internal electric flux nint depends implicitly\non that external flux. Combining eqs. (17), (21) with eqs. (19), (20) and taking the sums\nover the momenta p1,2 explicitly, we get:\nhLk (0)L\u2217k (x)in\n\nE\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n= const * e2\u03c0inint x/Ls cosh \u03c3 Lt x \u2212\nh\n\n\u0010\n\nhL\u22a5 (0)L\u2217\u22a5 (y)inE = const * cosh \u03c3eff (\u03c3, nint ) Lt y \u2212\n\nLs \u0011i\n,\n2\n\nLs \u0011i\n,\n2\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwhere formally a string tension coefficient \u03c3eff (\u03c3, nint ) for the plane\u2013plane correlator perpendicular to the field is:\n\u03c3eff (\u03c3, nint ) =\na\n\nh\ni\n1\narccosh cosh(\u03c3 Lt ) \u2212 cos(2\u03c0nint /Ls ) + 1 .\nLt\n\n(24)\n\nHere and below we take into account only the lowest \"mass state\" corresponding to the actual string\ntension tension, unless specified otherwise.\n\n9\n\n\fThus in the presence of an external electric field the plane\u2013plane Polyakov loop correlator\nparallel to the electric field oscillates with a decreasing amplitude.\nThe plane\u2013plane correlator perpendicular to the field decreases exponentially (without\noscillations) as function of the distance between the planes. The decrease of this correlator\nis controlled by an effective string tension (24) which is a function of the external electric\nfield (via nint ) and the actual string tension. The essential message here is that this\neffective string tension does not tell anything about confinement properties, since the\nconfinement is described by the real string tension \u03c3. Note that the effect of the external\nelectric field is absent if the internal flux is equal to quantized values\nnint = N * Ls ,\n\nN \u2208 ZZ .\n\n(25)\n\nThe origin of the \u03c3eff dependence on the external electric field strength is related to\nthe oscillatory behavior of the Polyakov loop correlator (16). Indeed, the bulk correlator\nh|L|2 iE (defined below in eq. (26)) comprises all possible Polyakov loop correlators. At\nsmall and increasing nint the sum of the oscillating quantities leads to a suppression of\nh|L|2 iE while at nint satisfying the special condition (25) the oscillations disappear and as\na result the effective string tension (24) coincides with the string tension in the absence\nof the external electric field.\nTo get rid of the direct influence of the electric field on the string tension (24) we\nuse only the real part of the Polyakov plane\u2013plane correlator which is parallel to the\nexternal field. We fit the numerical data by the real part of eq. (22) using (besides trivial\nprefactors) \u03c3 and nint \u2208 ZZ as fitting parameters. At the considered values of \u03b2 \u2265 1.6 we\nfind that the best fit is given by nint = next in accordance with our discussion in Section 3.\nIn the absence of external fields, the dependence of the string tension on \u03b2 has been\nfound in Ref. [7] and it is shown in Figure 3(a).

[7]. (b)\nFitted string tension for various \u03b2 values as function of the external electric flux nE .\nfunction: it is non\u2013zero in the low temperature phase (low \u03b2) and becomes very small (due\nto finite size effects) in the high temperature phase. From Figure 3(b) we conclude that\n10\n\n\fwithin errors the string tension does not depend on the external flux nE . This observation\nallows us to conclude that an external electric field in the compact (2+1)D Abelian gauge\ntheory does not change the confinement behavior compared to the zero field case.\nFor an external magnetic field (in the \"temporal\" z direction) the oscillating factor in\nthe Polyakov loop correlator is absent. Therefore, we have used eq. (22) with nint = 0\nto fit the plane\u2013plane correlation functions of the Polyakov lines. The numerical results\nfor the string tension \u03c3 are similar to those in the case of the electric field shown in\nFigure 3(b): within errors of the fit values we do not observe a dependence of the string\ntension on the strength of the external field. Therefore we do not show the plot of the\nstring tension vs. the external magnetic flux.\nSummarizing, both magnetic and electric fields do not influence the string tension.\nThis fact is analyzed in terms of the monopole properties in Section 6. Before doing so\nwe discuss the phase structure of the model using the Polyakov loop expectation value\nand the corresponding susceptibility.\n\n5\n\nPhase structure\n\nThe confinement\u2013deconfinement phase transition is usually detected using the Polyakov\nloop vacuum expectation value. It is convenient to study v.e.v.'s of the powers of the\n\"bulk Polyakov loop\" defined as follows:\nh|L|i =\n\n1 X\nh|\nL(x)|i ,\nL2s\nx\n\nh|L|2 i =\n\n1 X\n1 X\n2\nh|\nh L(x)L+ (y)i .\nL(x)|\ni\n=\n2\nL2s\nL\nx\ns x,y\n\n(26)\n\nThe Polyakov loop susceptibility is expressed via these quantities:\n\u03c7L = h|L|i2 \u2212 h|L|2 i .\n\n(27)\n\nAccording to the free energy arguments in the deconfinement phase the quantity |L|\nshould be non\u2013vanishing while in the confinement phase this quantity becomes small (it\napproaches zero in the infinite volume limit).\nIn the following we show that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop, similar to\nthe correlator discussed above, also gets a large classical contribution due to the external\nelectric field. Therefore it should not be used in general as an order parameter to probe\nthe restoration of confinement (except for some special values of the electric field).\n\n5.1\n\nElectric field\n\nThe behavior of the Polyakov loop vs. \u03b2 at various values of the external electric field\nis shown in Figure 4(a). The plot of the Polyakov loop at zero field agrees with general\nexpectations. However, as the electric field is turned on, the vacuum expectation value\nof the Polyakov loop is decreasing. One might conclude that the external electric field\nrestores the confinement phase (while being in deconfinement at nE = 0) which is in clear\ncontradiction with the results for the string tension shown in the previous Section. We\nremind the reader that the external electric field modifies the properties of the Polyakov\nloop correlator classically. In particular, for not too large nE it enhances what we called the\n11\n\n\f|L|\n\n0.008\n\n\u03c7L\n\nnE=0\nnE=32\nnE=64\nnE=1\nnE=2\nnE=4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.006\n\n0.004\n\n0.002\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\nnE=0\nnE=32\nnE=64\nnE=1\nnE=2\nnE=4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n2.5\n\n\u03b2\n\n3\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: (a) The absolute value of the bulk Polyakov loop (26) and (b) the Polyakov\nloop susceptibility (27) vs. \u03b2 for various values of the external electric field, nE .\neffective string tension measured from the Polyakov plane\u2013plane correlators perpendicular\nto the electric field (cf. eq. (24)). But, as we noted above, this effective string tension\ndoes not describe the confining properties of the system.\nThus we may conclude that the rapid decrease of the Polyakov loop as function of\nnE also does not mean that confinement is restored. Note that at large special values\nof the internal flux nint , eq. (25), the module of the Polyakov loop and the susceptibility\n(Figure 4(b)) as function of \u03b2 do not differ from the zero field case.\nLet us estimate the classical correction to the Polyakov loop expectation value due to\nthe external electric field E. For this purpose we consider the squared modulus of the\nPolyakov line, eq. (26). In the presence of E it can be written as follows:\nh|L|2 iE = const *\n\nX\nx,y\n\ne2\u03c0i nint x/Ls hL(0, 0)L\u2217 (x, y)i .\n\n(28)\n\nTaking into account eq. (17) for the point\u2013point Polyakov loop correlator and summing\nover all momenta pi in this equation we getb :\nh|L|2 iE =\n\nCm\n.\nm\u22650 cos(2\u03c0nint /Ls ) \u2212 cosh(\u03c3m Lt )\nX\n\n(29)\n\nHere the expansion over the excited mass states \u03c3m is written explicitly and the lowest\nstate corresponding to the string tension: \u03c30 = \u03c3. From Figures 4 it follows that \u03c7L \u226a\nh|L|i2 for all \u03b2 and nE values. Thus the square root of eq. (29) can serve as a good\nestimator for the Polyakov loop quantum average h|L|i.\nWe use only the first two terms of the expansion (29) to fit the behavior of the measured\nPolyakov loop vs. the external electric flux number. The corresponding fits for the\nconfinement and deconfinement phases are shown in Figure 5(a,b), respectively. The best\nb\n\nAccording to our considerations above the dominating internal flux is equal to the external flux in\nthe vicinity of the phase transition and thus we can safely put nint = nE .\n\n12\n\n\f|L|\n\n|L|\n\n\u03b2=1.5\n\n\u03b2=2.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.035\n0.2\n\n0.03\n0.1\n\n0.025\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n(a)\n\n40\n\n50\n\nnE\n\n0\n\n60\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n(b)\n\n50\n\nnE\n\n60\n\nFigure 5: The absolute value of the bulk Polyakov loop, (26) vs. the external electric\nflux nE and its fit by formula (29) in (a) the confinement phase (\u03b2 = 1.6) and (b) the\ndeconfinement (\u03b2 = 2.5) phase.\nfits for the string tension in the confinement phase (at \u03b2 = 1.6) give: \u03c30 = 0.167(13)\nand \u03c31 = 0.85(6). The value of \u03c30 can be compared with the string tension without\nexternal field, \u03c3 = 0.170(4). These values agree with each other within statistical errors.\nIn the deconfinement phase (\u03b2 = 2.5) the same picture is found: \u03c30 = 0.0096(5) and\n\u03c31 = 0.18(1), while the independent measurements at zero field lead to \u03c3 = 0.0101(1).\nTherefore, the behavior of the Polyakov loop approximated via eq. (29) in the external\nelectric field is consistent with the string tension measurements at zero\u2013field.\nSo, in the case of non\u2013vanishing external electric field, the bulk Polyakov loop expectation value may vanish regardless of the value of the actual string tension. Indeed, even\nat \u03c3 = 0 (which is not accessible on the finite lattice due to finite volume effects) the\nsquared Polyakov loop expectation value (29) is decreasing when turning on the external\nelectric flux. As we have mentioned in Section 4 the influence of the external field on\nthe Polyakov loop correlations is absent provided the condition (25) for the internal flux\nnint is fulfilled. Now, a similar effect is observed for the Polyakov loops themselves: the\ncorresponding values for nE = nint = 32, 64 clearly coincide with nE = 0 data. Thus\nwe conclude that the observables based on the Polyakov loops may have a usual physical\nsense only in the cases of the quantized internal field (25).\nAnalogously, Figures 4(a,b) show that the dependence of the Polyakov loop and its\nsusceptibility on the coupling constant \u03b2 are the same (within errors) for nE = 0 , 32, 64.\nThe peaks in susceptibility may serve as good indicator of the (pseudo)critical coupling\nconstant. At these distinguished values of the external electric field we have fitted the\nsusceptibility near its maximum by the following function:\n\u03c7fit\nL (\u03b2) =\n\nc21\n,\nc22 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2c )2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere ci and \u03b2c are fitting parameters.

The data points for all\nconsidered values of the external magnetic flux coincide with each other within errors.\nWe fit the Polyakov loop susceptibility by eq. (30) to get the (pseudo)critical couplings.\nThe corresponding phase diagram is shown in Figure 6(b) in the nM \u2212 \u03b2 plane. One sees\n14\n\n\fthat the phase transition points are insensitive to the strength of the external magnetic\nfield.\nIt is interesting to note that in non\u2013Abelian gauge theories in 3 + 1 dimensions the\nsituation is quite different [13]. Here the position of the deconfining phase transition\ndepends strongly on the strength of the applied magnetic field. The simplest, somewhat\nnaive explanation of this fact could be as follows. In the non\u2013Abelian gauge theory the\ncoupling between gauge fields is stronger than in the Abelian theory. In particular, there\nis a correlation between spatial and temporal components of the fields which may imply\nthat the external magnetic field (encoded in the spatial components) induces internal\nelectric fluxes on the quantum level. As we have seen the electric fluxes strongly influence\nthe Polyakov loop correlators generating the effective string tension (24). Contrary to\nthe Abelian case this influence is not a merely classical (or, just inherent to the way of\nintroducing the external field) but a real quantum effect.\nIn the next Section we study the effects of the external fields on the agents of confinement, the Abelian monopoles, to explain the observed behavior of the system. A similar\nstudy for the non\u2013Abelian gauge theory is underway [24].\n\n6\n\nMonopole properties\n\nThe basic quantity to describe the behavior of the monopoles is the monopole density,\n\u03c1mon =\n\nX\nc\n\n|mc | ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere mc is the integer valued monopole charge inside the cube c defined in the standard\nway [25]:\nmc =\n\n1 X\n(\u22121)P [d\u03b8]mod 2\u03c0 .\n2\u03c0 P \u2208\u2202c\n\n(32)\n\nIn our previous study [7] we have demonstrated that the monopoles are sensitive to the\nphase transition in the compact Abelian gauge model at finite temperature. Although\nin (2 + 1)D we have magnetic and electric field among the three components of the field\nstrength tensor, the sources of the respective fluxes will be simply called \"monopoles\" or\n\"magnetic charges\" in the following.\nThe mechanism which drives the finite temperature deconfinement phase transition\nis monopole binding. In the zero temperature case the plasma of monopoles and anti\u2013\nmonopoles can explain the permanent confinement of oppositely charged electric test\ncharges [1] in bound states, kept together by a linear potential. Confinement appears due\nto the screening of the magnetic field induced by the electric current circulating along the\nWilson loop. Monopoles and anti\u2013monopoles form a polarized sheet of finite thickness\n(\"string\") along the minimal surface |A| spanned by the Wilson loop. The formation of\nthe string leads, for non\u2013vanishing electric current, to an excess of the free energy equal\nto \u03c3|A|.\nAt finite temperature, dipoles are formed both in the confinement and deconfinement\nphases. In the deconfinement phase tightly bound dipoles dominate in the vacuum. The\n15\n\n\fdipole plasma is inefficient to completely screen the field created by the electric currents\nrunning along the pair of Polyakov loops. This explains the absence of confinement in\nthis phase.\nBesides measuring the density of monopoles, we have studied the properties of the\nmonopole ensembles by investigating the structure of monopole clusters. Clusters are\nconnected groups of monopoles and anti\u2013monopoles, where each object is separated from\nat least one neighbor belonging to \u221a\nthe same cluster by a distance less or equal than Rmax .\nIn the following we use Rmax = 3 a which means that neighboring monopole cubes\nshould share at least one single cornerc . The increase of the coupling constant leads not\nonly to an increase of the temperature, eq. (3), but also to a decreasing lattice spacing a,\neq. (2). Thus at different \u03b2 the same characteristic distance Rmax corresponds to different\nphysical scales. Therefore our results presented here are of a qualitative nature.\nIn our study without external field we have found that the dipoles are oriented dominantly in the temporal direction. At the confinement phase transition mostly clusters\nwith two constituents or single monopoles and anti\u2013monopoles were observed. Decreasing\nfurther the temperature (or \u03b2), the monopoles become dense and start to form connected\nclusters (on a coarser and coarser lattice) containing various numbers of monopoles and\nanti\u2013monopoles. The largest clusters have been found to be more and more spherical.\nFinally we observed that only charged monopoles clusters in the plasma (mainly individual monopoles) are needed to explain the measured string tension and, therefore, are\nresponsible for confinement.\n\n6.1\n\nElectric field\n\nTo begin, we plot in Figure 8(a) the total monopole density \u03c1 as function of the coupling\n1e\u221201\n\n\u03c1mon\n\n\u03c1mon\n\n1e\u221201\n\n1e\u221202\n1e\u221202\n\nnE=0\nnE=32\nnE=56\nnE=64\n\n1e\u221203\n\n1e\u221204\n\n1e\u221205\n\n1\n\n\u03b2=1.8\n\u03b2=2.1\n\u03b2=2.3\n\u03b2=2.5\n\n1e\u221203\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\u03b2\n\n1e\u221204\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n(b)\n\nnE\n\n60\n\nFigure 8: Monopole density \u03c1mon (a) vs. \u03b2 for various external electric fluxes, nE ; (b) vs.\nnE for various \u03b2 values.\n\u03b2 for various values of the external electric flux nE . The monopole density is a decreasing\nc\n\nIn Ref.[26] a similar definition has been used to investigate tightly packed clusters with Rmax = a.\nIn our case the condition for the cluster is more relaxed.\n\n16\n\n\ffunction of \u03b2 at any value of the external field. However, \u03c1 increases as the function of\nthe strength of the applied external field, Figure 8(b). The effect of the external field is\nvery essential: the monopole density is increased up to almost two orders of magnitude\n(depending on the temperature) for the largest external flux values (compared to the\nsystem at zero external field).\nHowever, an increased total monopole density does not mean in general that the confining properties of the system are enhanced. Only charged monopole clusters in the plasma\nstate contribute to the string tension between electrically charged test particles. Tightly\nbound monopole pairs are not expected to contribute to the string tension. Therefore, we\nuse our cluster labeling algorithm to look into the structure of the monopole ensemble.\nIn Figures 9(a,b) we show how the densities of single monopoles (clusters made of just\n1e\u221201\n\n1e\u221201\n\n\u03c1\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c1\n\n1e\u221202\n\n1e\u221202\n\n\u03b2=1.5\n\u03b2=1.8\n\u03b2=2.4\n\n\u03b2=1.5\n\u03b2=1.8\n\u03b2=2.4\n\n1e\u221203\n\n1e\u221203\n\n1e\u221204\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n(a)\n\nnE\n\n1e\u221204\n\n60\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n(b)\n\nnE\n\n60\n\nFigure 9: The density of clusters of size (a) N = 1 (single monopoles and anti\u2013monopoles)\nand (b) N = 2 (dipoles) vs. external electric flux nE at various values of \u03b2.\none (anti\u2013)monopole) and of dipoles (clusters made of two oppositely charged objects),\nrespectively, depend on the strength of the external electric field.\nOne clearly sees that the plasma component of the single monopole ensemble does\nnot feel the electric field at all. Thus the confining properties of the system should\nnot depend on the external electric field in agreement with the conclusions made in the\nprevious Sections.\nOn the other hand, the dipole density changes drastically with increasing external\nfield: the field creates the magnetic dipoles from the vacuum. Note that the larger the\ntemperature (or, equivalently, \u03b2), the larger is the increase of the dipole density. This\nfact is connected with the screening of the external fields inside the medium discussed in\nSection 3. The larger the temperature the larger the fields are inside the medium. As a\nresult, the effect of the external field becomes stronger with increasing temperature.\nIn a non\u2013zero electric field the system is anisotropic in all directions. The electric field\nis directed along the y axis, the \"temperature\" direction, z, is influenced by compactification. Therefore, we have to expect that the average sizes of the dipoles in different\ndirections are not the same. At zero or small external field the dipoles are mainly directed\nalong the temporal axis [7].\n17\n\n\fIncreasing the external field, the dipoles are expected to become elongated along the\ndirection of the applied field. Moreover, we have observed in Section 3 that the strength\nof the internal field inside the medium relative to the external field increases as function\nof the coupling \u03b2. Thus the elongation of the dipoles in the field direction should increase\nwith \u03b2.\nAll these effects are demonstrated in Figure 10 using ellipsoids, the axes of which are\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 10: The mean dipole anisotropy for increasing values of (a) the external electric\nflux nE at fixed \u03b2 = 1.8; (b) \u03b2 at fixed nE .\nequal to the average dipole sizes in the x, y and z directions. In Figure 10(a) we show how\nthe mean dipole anisotropy changes with increasing external electric flux at fixed \u03b2 = 1.8\n(in the confinement phase). Figure 10(b) demonstrates the dependence of the ellipsoids\non \u03b2 at fixed flux nE . For convenience the projections of the ellipsoids onto the x \u2212 y and\nx \u2212 z planes are also shown.\n\n6.2\n\nMagnetic field\n\nThe influence of the magnetic field on the monopole densities is very similar to that of\nthe electric field. In Figures 11(a,b) we present the measured total monopole density and\nthe dipole density, as functions of \u03b2 and the external fluxes, respectively. To compare\nthe measurements for magnetic fluxes with those at non\u2013zero external electric field, we\nnote that for our lattice geometry the strengths of the magnetic and electric fields are\nequal to each other provided nM = 4nE . According to those Figures both total monopole\ndensity and dipole density do not depend on the type of the external fields if the field\nstrengths are the same. We have checked that the single monopole density coincides for\nmagnetic and electric fields of the same strength as well. Thus the cluster structure does\nnot depend on whether the external field is of electric or magnetic kind.\n18\n\n\f\u03c1mon\n\n1e\u221201\n\n\u03c1\n\n1e\u221201\n\n1e\u221202\n\n1e\u221203\n\nnext=0\nnE=32\nnM=128\nnE=64\nnM=256\n\n(2)\n\n1e\u221202\n\nE: \u03b2=1.5\nE: \u03b2=1.8\nE: \u03b2=2.4\nM: \u03b2=1.5\nM: \u03b2=1.8\nM: \u03b2=2.4\n\n1e\u221203\n\n1e\u221204\n\n1e\u221204\n\n1e\u221205\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n\u03b2\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nnE, nM /4\n\n60\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 11: (a) Total monopole density \u03c1mon vs. \u03b2 for various external flux values next .\n(b) density of dipole clusters vs. next = nE = nM /4 for some \u03b2 values.\nThe mean dipole anisotropy depends on the type (direction) of the external field.

In the external magnetic field the system is symmetric in the x\nand y directions. The dipoles become more elongated in the (temporal) z direction for\nstronger external magnetic fields. Increasing the coupling \u03b2 leads to a larger anisotropy\n19\n\n\fsince the medium does not screen the external field in the deconfinement (large\u03b2).\nThe orientation properties of the dipoles influence the resulting electromagnetic fields\nin the medium, Figure 1. According to Figures 10(a) and 12(a) the stronger the external\nfield the larger elongation of the dipoles in the direction of the field is. In turn this\nincreases the dipole momenta in the direction of the applied field and, as a result, leads to\nan enhanced screening of the external fields by the media. This effect is clearly observed\nin Figure 1.\nAnother interesting effect due to the dipole orientation is the clear difference in screening for strong magnetic and electric fields of equal strengths in the deconfinement phase,\nFigure 1. According to Figure 11(b), the dipole densities for both cases are the same.\nSince Lt < Ls , the dipole magnetic moment density projected to the magnetic field direction is larger than the corresponding quantity for the electric field direction. On the other\nhand, the larger the dipole moment density inside the medium the stronger the field\nattenuation is. Thus at strong external fields the screening must be more effective for\nmagnetic fields compared to electric fields. This mechanism works at high temperatures\n(large \u03b2) where the dipole fraction is dominant (cf. Figures 9(a,b)).\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have investigated the properties of the 3D compact electrodynamics at finite temperature in external constant electric and magnetic fields. The main result is that the\ndeconfinement temperature is insensitive to both electric and magnetic external fields. We\nhave found the reason for this behavior in terms of the monopole degrees of freedom: the\nexternal fields create tightly bound magnetic dipoles (monopole-anti\u2013monopole bound\nstates) from the vacuum while the density of unpaired monopoles (which are responsible for the confinement of electric charges) stays unchanged. This result is not obvious\nfrom the beginning since another option is possible: the external fields could destroy the\nmonopole bound states enforcing confining properties of the medium. This is not the\ncase.\nAt zero external fields the magnetic dipole states are more elongated in the temperature direction. The external magnetic field which is parallel to the temperature direction\nmakes this elongation stronger. However, an external electric field turns the dipoles to\nthe corresponding spatial direction. The effects of the external field on the medium are\nstronger in the deconfinement phase in which both electric and magnetic external fields\nare not screened.\nWe have also shown that the external electric field influences the Polyakov loop classically (or, in other words, on tree level). This leads to a vanishing Polyakov loop and, in\ncertain cases, to a non\u2013vanishing \"effective string tension\" (24) depending on the external\nfield (being in deconfinement at zero field). However, this behavior of the Polyakov loop\ndoes not indicate a restoration of confinement for certain external field fluxes. At special\nflux values (for which the internal electric field is quantized according to eq. (25)) both\nPolyakov loop expectation value and \u03c3eff coincide with the values at zero external field.\nThe string tension (correctly defined from the correlation function of Polyakov plane\u2013\nplane correlators parallel to the external electric field in spatial direction) is not influenced\nby the external electric field and coincides with the zero\u2013field value.\n20\n\n\fThe tree level effects on Polyakov loops and Polyakov loop correlation functions are\nabsent for external magnetic fields pointing in the time\u2013like direction.\nThe dynamics of the Abelian system is different from the behavior of the (3 + 1)D\nnon\u2013Abelian gauge theory. The authors of Ref. [13] have found that the external magnetic\nfield increases the deconfinement temperature contrary to our results in (2 + 1)D compact\nAbelian gauge theory. The reason of this difference may lie in the different behavior of\nthe monopoles in the Abelian and non\u2013Abelian gauge theories. The investigation of the\nmonopole properties in the non\u2013Abelian gauge theory is underway [24].\n\nAcknowledgements\nM. N.
