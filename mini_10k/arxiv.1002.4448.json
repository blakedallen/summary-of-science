At short distances\nthe theory of Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity with a flow parameter \u03bb describes interacting\nnon-relativistic gravitons and is supposed to be power counting renormalizable in (1+3)\ndimensions. Recently, its black hole solutions have been intensively investigated in [3, 4, 5,\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nThere are two classes of Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity in the literature: the projectable and\nnonprojectable theories where the former (latter) implies that the lapse function depends\non time (time and space). A main issue of the Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity is still to answer\nto the question of whether it can accommodate the Ho\u0159ava scalar \u03c8, in addition to two\ndegrees of freedom (DOF) for a massless graviton. To this end, we would like to mention\nrelevant works. The authors [19] have shown that in the nonprojectable theories, the Ho\u0159ava\nscalar \u03c8 is related to a scalar degree of freedom appeared in the massless limit of a massive\ngraviton. Especially for the Hamiltonian approach to the HL gravity, the authors [20]\ndid not consider the Hamiltonian constraint as a second class constraint, which leads to\na strange result that there are no DOF left when imposing the constraints of the theory.\nMoreover, the authors [21] have claimed that there are no solution of the lapse function\nwhich satisfies the constraints. Unfortunately, it implies a surprising conclusion that there\nis no evolution at all for any observable. However, more recently, it was shown that the IR\nversion of HL gravity (\u03bbR-model) is completely equivalent to the general relativity for any\n\u03bb when employing a consistent Hamiltonian formalism based on Dirac algorithm [22].\nIn the projectable theories, the authors [23, 24] have argued that \u03c8 is propagating around\nthe Minkowski space but it has a negative kinetic term, showing a ghost instability. In this\ncase, the Ho\u0159ava scalar becomes ghost if the sound speed square (c2\u03c8 ) is positive. In order\nto make this scalar healthy, the sound speed square must be negative, but it is inevitably\nunstable. Thus, one way to avoid this is to choose the case that the sound speed square is\nclose to zero, which implies the limit of \u03bb \u2192 1. However, in this limit, the cubic interactions\nare important at very low energies, called the strong coupled problem [25]. This invalidates\nany linearized analysis and any predictability of quantum gravity is lost due to unsuppressed\nloop corrections. This casts serious doubts on the UV completeness of the theory. The\nauthors [26] tried to extend the theory to make a healthy HL gravity, but there has been some\ndebate as to whether this theory is really healthy [27, 28, 29]. The projectability condition\nfrom condensed matter physics may not be appropriate for describing the (quantum) gravity.\n2\n\n\fInstead, if one does not impose the projectability condition, the HL gravity leads to general\nrelativity without the strong coupling problem in the IR limit.\nOn the other hand, the Lifshitz-type black holes [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] have received\nconsiderable attentions since these may provide a model of generalizing AdS/CFT correspondence to non-relativistic condensed matter physics [37, 38, 39]. However, even though\ntheir asymptotic spacetimes are apparently simple as Lifshitz, the problem of obtaining an\nanalytic solution seems to be a nontrivial task. Some examples include a 4D topological\nblack hole which is asymptotically Lifshitz with the dynamical exponent z = 2 [40]. An\nanalytic black hole solution with z = 2 that asymptotes a planer Lifshitz spacetime was\nfound in 4D spacetimes [41], and numerical solutions were also explored in [42, 43]. The\nanalytic examples of Lifshitz black holes in higher dimensions were reported in [44] Interestingly, the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole [45] was derived from the new massive gravity (NMG)\nin 3D spacetimes [46]. It was claimed that there is a subtle issue to define thermodynamic\nquantities of this black hole because of negative mass and entropy [36]. However, a thermodynamic study for the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole was performed by using the 2D dilaton\ngravity approach [47], showing that its thermodynamics is rather simple and is consistently\ndefined. Also, a boundary stress-tensor approach to this black hole has confirmed that the\nwrong (negative)-sign Einstein-Hilbert term provides really a consistent thermodynamics\nof the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole [48].\nConcerning a static spherically symmetric solution, L\u00fc-Mei-Pope (LMP) have obtained\nthe black hole solution with \u03bb [3] and topological black holes were found in [4]. We remind\nthe reader that these black hole solutions were obtained from the Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity\nwithout imposing the projectability condition (nonprojectable theories). Within the projectable theories, their black hole solutions are less interesting [49]. Its thermodynamics was\nstudied in [7, 8], but there remain unclear issues in obtaining the ADM mass and the entropy\nbecause for 1/3 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1/2, the LMP solution belongs to Lifshitz black holes with 2 \u2264 z \u2264 4.\nIn this case, the entropy may take a very unusual form as S = A/4 \u2212 (\u03c0/\u039bW ) ln[A/4] with\nA the area of horizon [14]. It was well known that many different kinds of black holes from\nstring theories have the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of SBH = A/4 [50]. Thus, one has\nto explain why a logarithmic term (\u2212\u03c0/\u039bW ) ln[A/4] appears as a part of the entropy of\nLifshitz black hole in the HL gravity [51, 52]. This term arises because one has used the\nfirst law of dS = dm/TH to derive the entropy, provided that the Hawking temperature TH\nand the mass m have been known. Indeed, the mass m was not clearly defined by either the\ncondition of the zero metric function f = 0 [7] or a Hamiltonian approach [8]. Until now,\n\n3\n\n\fthere is no definite way to calculate the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass MADM for\nthe Lifshitz black hole, if one insists that the ADM mass should be evaluated at asymptotic\nLifshitz. Hence, it would be better to use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy to derive the\nhorizon mass for Lifshitz black holes when applying the first law of dMh = TH dSBH [53, 43].\nIn this work, we obtain the horizon mass of the Lifshitz black holes in the nonprojectable HL gravity. In deriving this mass, we use the first law of thermodynamics and\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We investigate thermodynamics of z = 3, 2 Lifshitz black\nholes in the nonprojectable Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity by comparing with the z = 3 Lifshitz\nblack hole in the NMG. Finally, we discuss a second order phase transition between the\nz = 3, 2 Lifshitz black holes and the z = 1 Ho\u0159ava black hole.\n\n2\n\nHL gravity\n\nIntroducing the ADM formalism where the metric is parameterized\n\u0010\n\nds2ADM = \u2212N 2 dt2 + gij dxi \u2212 N i dt\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ndxj \u2212 N j dt ,\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\u221a h\nd4 x gN Kij K ij \u2212 K 2 + R \u2212 2\u039b ,\n\n(2)\n\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action can be expressed as\nSEH =\n\n1\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\nwhere G is Newton's constant and extrinsic curvature Kij takes the form\nKij =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u0121ij \u2212 \u2207i Nj \u2212 \u2207j Ni .\n2N\n\n(3)\n\nHere, a dot denotes a derivative with respect to t.

We note that\nthe wrong-sign appears in the Einstein-Hilbert term (EH) when comparing to the original\naction [46]. This means that we keep a relative (\u2212) sign of higher order curvature term\nfixed with respect to the EH.\nThe field equation is given by\n1\n1\nRM N \u2212 gM N R + \u039bgM N \u2212 2 KM N = 0,\n2\n2u\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n1\n1\nRgM N\nKM N = 2 RM N \u2212 \u2207M \u2207N R \u2212\n2\n2\n3\n3\n+ 4RM N P Q RP Q \u2212 RRM N \u2212 RP Q RP Q gM N + R2 gM N .\n2\n8\n\n(12)\n\nIn order to have the Lifshitz black hole solution with dynamical exponent z, it is convenient\nto introduce dimensionless parameters\ny = u2 l2 , w = \u039b l2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere y and w are proposed to take\ny=\u2212\n\nz2 + z + 1\nz 2 \u2212 3z + 1\n, w=\u2212\n.\n2\n2\n5\n\n(14)\n\n\fFor the z = 1 non-rotating BTZ black hole, one has y =\n\n1\n2\n\nand w = \u2212 23 , while y = \u2212 21\n\nand w = \u2212 13\n2 are chosen for the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole. For z = 1 and 3, the black hole\nsolutions are given by\nds23D = \u2212x2z F (r)dt2 +\nwhere\n\n1\nH(r)dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b8 2 ,\nx2\n\nr2\n1\nMl2\nr\n= 1 \u2212 2 = 1 \u2212 +2 .\nx = , F (r) =\nl\nH(r)\nr\nr\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nWe emphasize that M is a mass parameter related to the horizon mass M . A naive condition\nof F (r) = 0 could not determine the horizon mass M in the z = 3 Lifshitz black holes, as\n2 /l2 for the z = 1 non-rotating BTZ black hole. The metric (15) implies\ncontrasts to M = r+\n\nthat a curvature singularity appears at r = 0 as is shown [45]\n260 152M 24M2\n26 8M\nMN\n+\n,\nR\nR\n=\n\u2212 2 2 +\n,\n(17)\nM\nN\nl2\nr2\nl4\nl r\nr4\n\u221a\nand a single event horizon is located at r = r+ = l M.

We check that the above quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics\ndM = TH dSBH .\n\n(19)\n\nNow we are in a position to explain why we start with the wrong-sign EH term in\n(9). When making a replacement of G3 \u2192 \u2212G3 to go back the original NMG [46], the\ntemperature is the same, but mass and entropy are negative [36]. Negative mass and entropy\nare not permissible for black hole physicists and thus, this problem should be resolved. One\nway to resolve it was to replace the Newton's constant G3 by \u2212G3 , leading to our action\n(8). It was shown that this replacement is indeed necessary to regard the NMG as a unitary\nmassive gravity [55]. The NMG is equivalent to the Fierz-Pauli massive gravity within the\nlinearized theory. In three dimensions, a massless graviton has no DOF, while a massive\ngraviton is a physically propagating mode with two helicities. In constructing the NMG\nwith higher order curvature term, the important thing was that one can neglect a massless\ngraviton whatever its norm is positive or negative, in favor of a massive graviton without\nghost from (10) [56]. In this sense, our action (8) is a reliable one to derive the correct\n6\n\n\fthermodynamic quantities. Importantly, we note that the higher order curvature term (10)\nof the NMG is not a perturbative correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, but the main\nterm to obtain the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole. Recently, a boundary stress-tensor approach\nto this black hole [48] has confirmed that the wrong (negative)-sign Einstein-Hilbert term\nprovides really a thermodynamics of the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole which is consistent with\n(18). Especially, a proper definition for the mass of the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole was\nintroduced.\nFor z = 1 and 3, their quantities could be rewritten by the compact forms\nTHz =\n\nxz+\n2z z+1\n2\nz\n, Mz =\nxz+1\nx ,\n+ , C = 4\u03c0x+ , S = 4\u03c0r+ , F = \u2212\n2\u03c0l\n1+z\n1+z +\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the heat capacity and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy remain unchanged.\nConsidering the free energy of F z and the coordinate matching (see Fig. 1), there is a\ncrossing point at x+ = xc = 0.82 where F z=1 (x+ ) is equal to F z=3 (x+ ). This implies that\nfor 0 \u2264 x+ \u2264 xc , F z=3 \u2265 F z=1 , while for x+ \u2265 xc , F z=3 \u2264 F z=1 . That is, for 0 \u2264 x+ \u2264 xc ,\nthe z = 1 non-rotating BTZ black hole is more favorable than the z = 3 Lifshitz black\nhole, while for x+ \u2265 xc , the z = 3 Lifshitz black hole is more favorable than the z = 1\nnon-rotating BTZ black hole. This may imply a second order phase transition between\ntwo black holes [57]. However, we note that two black holes have different asymptotes:\nLifshitz and AdS3 spacetimes. Hence, the phase transition occurs unlikely between two\nblack holes. In order to see it explicitly, we use the other called the temperature matching.\nWhen expressing their free energy in terms of their Hawking temperatures, one has\n4\n3\nF z=3 (TH ) = \u2212 (2\u03c0lTH ) 3 , F z=1 (TH ) = \u2212(2\u03c0lTH )2 ,\n2\n\n(21)\n\nwhich shows that for 0 \u2264 TH \u2264 Tc , F z=3 (TH ) \u2264 F z=1 (TH ), while for TH \u2265 Tc , F z=3 (TH ) \u2265\n\nF z=1 (TH ) with Tc =\n\n1.82\n2\u03c0l .\n\nIn Fig. 3, we use the notation of 2\u03c0TH \u2192 TH with l = 1 for\n\nsimplicity. This means that the temperature matching provides the result which is opposite\nto the coordinate matching.\nConsequently, a second order phase transition is unlikely possible to occur between two\nblack holes.\n\n4\n\n4D Lifshitz black holes in the nonprojectable HL gravity\n\nA static spherically symmetric (SSS) solution to the nonprojectable HL gravity was obtained\nby considering the line element\nds24D = \u2212N (r)2 dt2 +\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 .\nf (r)\n\n7\n\n(22)\n\n\fFz HTH L\n\nFz Hx+ L\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nx+\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTH\n\n-2\n\n-0.5\n\n-4\n-1\n\n-6\n\n-1.5\n\n-8\n\n-2\n\n-10\n\nFigure 1: Graphs of 3D free energy F z (x+ ) and F z (TH ).

The L\u00fc-Mei-Pope (LMP) solution for the HL gravity is given by\nq\n\nf (x) = 1 + x2 \u2212 \u03b1xp\u00b1 (\u03bb) , N (x) = xq\u00b1 (\u03bb) f (x),\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an integration constant related to the horizon mass of the black hole and\n\u221a\n\u221a\np\n2\u03bb \u00b1 6\u03bb \u2212 2\n1 + 3\u03bb \u00b1 2 6\u03bb \u2212 2\n, q\u00b1 (\u03bb) = \u2212\n.\n(26)\nx = \u2212\u039bW r, p\u00b1 (\u03bb) =\n\u03bb\u22121\n\u03bb\u22121\nIn this work, we choose p\u2212 (\u03bb) = p and q\u2212 (\u03bb) = q and thus, 2p + q = 1. In this case, it was\nshown that for p < 2, the LMP solution is singular at r = 0 [58] as\nR = 6\u039bW +\n\n2\u03b1(1 + p)xp\n.\nr2\n8\n\n(27)\n\n\fHere we note that for p = \u22121(\u03bb = 1/3), 3D Ricci scalar R is regular at r = 0, which implies\nthat the \u03bb = 1/3 does not correspond to a Lifshitz black hole. Its extremal black hole with\nf (xe ) = 0 and f \u2032 (xe ) = 0 are located as\n1\n1\nxe = 0, for < \u03bb \u2264 ; xe =\n3\n2\n\nr\n\np\n=\n2\u2212p\n\ns\n\n\u221a\n1\n2\u03bb \u2212 6\u03bb \u2212 2\n\u221a\n, for \u03bb > .\n2\n\u22122 + 6\u03bb \u2212 2\n\n(28)\n\nHowever, assuming the near-horizon geometry of AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 , the radius v2 of S 2 is negative\nfor 1/3 < \u03bb \u2264 1/2, which means that the near-horizon geometry of extremal black hole is\nill-defined and the corresponding Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is zero [16]. For \u03bb > 1/2, the\nnear-horizon geometry of extremal black holes are AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 with different radii, depending\non the HL gravity. This shows clearly that for 1/3 < \u03bb \u2264 1/2, the horizon at xe = 0 is\na single horizon but not a degenerate horizon. Actually, these correspond to the Lifshitz\nblack holes with 2 \u2264 z < 4 [7].\nIn order to understand this branch of the LMP black holes fully, it is necessary to introduce 4D Lifshitz black holes. Their line element takes the form with dynamical exponent\nz [31, 32, 40, 45]\nds2Lif = \u2212x2z F (r)dt2 +\n\n1\nH(r)dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a922 ,\nx2\n\n(29)\n\nwhere F (r) and H(r) are functions of a radial coordinate r with\nlim F (r) = lim H(r) = 1.\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(30)\n\nComparing the LMP black holes (22) with the Lifshitz black holes (29) leads to the correspondence\nN 2 = \u00d1 2 f = x2(q+1)\n\nx2\nf\n2z\n\u2192\nx\nF\n(r),\nf\n\u2192\nx2\nH(r)\n\n(31)\n\n1\nf\n= 2.\nH(r)\nx\n\n(32)\n\nwhich imply the two relations\nz = q + 1, F (r) =\n\nThis indicates how the 4D Lifshitz black holes originate from a non-relativistic theory of\nthe HL gravity. We note that the z = 3, 2 Lifshitz black holes are obtained from either\nZ=2 or 3 HL action, which means that a relevant quantity to determine the exponent z is\nnot the dynamical scaling dimension Z but the flow parameter \u03bb through q (\u03bb = 0.36 \u2192\nz = 3, \u03bb = 1/2 \u2192 z = 2). As far as the LMP solution is concerned, there is no distinction\nbetween Z = 2 and Z = 3 HL gravities because of Cij = 0. It seems that this is a feature\nof the HL gravity, compared with the NMG.\n\n9\n\n\fTzH Hx+ L\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nMzh Hx+ L\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\nx+\n\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\nx+\n\nFigure 2: Graphs of Hawking temperature THz (x+ ) and horizon mass Mhz (x+ ) with \u039bW =\n\u22121(x+ = r+ ).

The Hawking temperature is defined\nby\nTHz (x+ )\n\n\u03ba\n=\n=\n2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\ni\n\u2212\u039bW h\n(z + 2)xz+ + (z \u2212 2) xz\u22122\n,\n+\n8\u03c0\n\nwhere we use the relations of q = z + 1 and p =\n\n2\u2212z\n2\n\n(33)\n\nin deriving the last expression. As is\n\nshown in Fig. 1, for 2 \u2264 z < 4, it is a monotonically increasing function like T \u2243 xz+ for\nlarge x+ . In order to find the horizon mass, we may use the first law of thermodynamics\ndMh = TH dSBH ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy2 satisfies the area-law of\n2\nSBH = \u03c0r+\n.\n2\n\n2\nThe other entropy of S = \u03c0r+\n\u2212\n\n\u03c0\n\u039bW\n\n2\nln[\u03c0r+\n] could be obtained from the first law of dS =\n\n(35)\ndm\nTH\n\nprovided\n\n2\n\nthe mass of m \u2243 \u03b1 and the temperature (33) were known [4, 8, 51, 52]. However, it is hard to accept\nthis entropy because one could not have a logarithmic term unless either thermal correction or quantum\ncorrection is considered. In the HL gravity, higher order curvature term plays an essential role to make the\nLifshitz black hole. This is not a correction to the wrong-sign EH term. Hence, the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy is more natural to derive the horizon mass.\n\n10\n\n\fCz Hx+ L\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\nx\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 +\n\nFz Hx+ L\n0.1\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nx+\n\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\n\nFigure 3: Graphs of heat capacity C z (x+ ) and free energy F z (x+ ) with \u039bW = \u22121(x+ = r+ ).\nLeft: two dashed curves represent the heat capacity for z = 2, 3 from top to bottom and\n\u221a\nthe solid curve denotes the z = 1 heat capacity which is negative for x+ < 1/ 3.

The free energy is necessary to study a phase\ntransition to other configuration.

We call this\nthe z = 1 Ho\u0159ava black hole because its near-horizon geometry of the extremal black hole is\nAdS2 \u00d7 S 2 and its asymptote is AdS4 spacetimes [3], implying that it is basically different\n\u221a\nfrom the z = 3, 2 Lifshitz black holes. At the extremal point of x+ = xe = 1/ 3, we have\nthermodynamic properties of THz=1 (xe ) = C z=1 (xe ) = 0 and (dMhz=1 /dx+ )|x+ =xe = 0. If\none uses the entropy of S = A/4 \u2212 (\u03c0/\u039bW ) ln[A/4] to derive quasinormal modes of this\nblack hole [59], the area spacing is not equidistant. Here, we have equidistant area spacing\nbecause of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\nAll solid curves in Figs. 2 and 3 represent thermodynamic quantities for the z = 1\nHo\u0159ava black hole.\nFor large Lifshitz black holes with x+ \u226b 1, their forms of thermodynamic quantities are\ngiven by\nz+2\n2\nz\nTHz \u2243 xz+ , Mhz \u2243 xz+2\n+ , C \u2243 x+ , F \u2243 x+ ,\n\n(43)\n\nwhile the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (35) remains unchanged.\nFinally, comparing (43) with (20), their forms are very similar to each other, but the\ndifference is exponents of Mh , C, SBH , and F arisen from the dimensionality.\n\n6\n\nPhase transitions\n\nWe discuss a possible phase transition by considering the coordinate matching. We note\n\u221a\nthat the free energy of F z=1 in Eq.(41) is available only for x+ > xe = 1/ 3 = 0.58 because\n\u221a\none could not define the positive temperature for x+ < xe = 1/ 3. In this case, as is shown\n12\n\n\fFig. 3, there are two crossing points at x+ = xc = 0.84, 1 where F z=1 (x+ ) = F z=3,2 (x+ ).\nThis implies that for xe \u2264 x+ \u2264 xc , F z=3,2 \u2265 F z=1 , while for x+ \u2265 xc , F z=3,2 \u2264 F z=1 . In\nother words, for xe \u2264 x+ \u2264 xc , the z = 1 black hole is more favorable than z = 3, 2 Lifshitz\nblack holes, while for x+ \u2265 xc , the z = 3, 2 Lifshitz black holes are more favorable than the\nz = 1 Ho\u0159ava black hole. This may imply a second order phase transition between Lifshitz\nblack holes and z = 1 Ho\u0159ava black hole. It seems that this phase transition is related to\nthe second order phase transition between black hole with scalar hair (Martinez-TroncosoZanelli black hole [60]) and topological black hole with k = \u22121 [61, 57], which have the\nsame AdS4 asymptotes. However, the coordinate matching is not an appropriate choice\nfor investigating a second order phase transition. The appropriate one is the temperature\nmatching. Unfortunately, we could not make a second order phase transition between\nz = 3, 2 Lifshitz black holes and z = 1 Ho\u0159ava black hole when using the temperature\nmatching because they have different asymptotes. It is clear from Fig. 2 that there is no\ncrossing point between THz=3,2 (x+ ) and THz=1 (x+ ) to make the temperature matching.\n\n7\n\nDiscussions\n\nFirst of all, we mention that 4D Lifshitz black holes came from the nonprojectable HL\ngravity, not the projectable theory. The projectability condition from condensed matter\nphysics may not be appropriate for describing the (quantum) gravity. Especially for static\nspherically symmetric solutions, the non-projectability condition is necessary to obtain 4D\nLifshitz black holes.\nIt is important to note that 3D Lifshitz and 4D Lifshitz black holes are obtained only\nwhen including higher order curvature terms, even though the former action is Lorentzinvariant combination with wrong-sign Einstein-Hilbert action and the latter is Lorentzviolating combination. This mean that these Lifshitz black holes have purely gravity origin\nwithout introducing any matter field. We emphasize that the role of higher order curvature\nterms is essential for obtaining these black holes, where these terms are not considered\nsimply as perturbative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action. If these terms are absent,\none finds the z = 1 non-rotating BTZ black hole from the 3D Einstein gravity and the\nSchwarzschild-AdS black hole from the 4D Einstein gravity.\nThese Lifshitz black holes have much similarities. Their horizons are non-degenerate.\nTheir thermodynamic quantities are derived from the Hawking temperature and the BekensteinHawking entropy when using the first law of thermodynamics. In this approach, we cannot\n\n13\n\n\fderive the horizon mass unless the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is used. We may insist that\nthe area-law of the black hole entropy and the first law of thermodynamics are valid for\nLifshitz black holes [36, 48]. In this direction, the dynamical evolution of a massless scalar\nperturbation was investigated in the 4D Lifshitz black hole spacetimes with the dynamical\nexponent z = 4(\u03bb = 1/3), z = 2(\u03bb = 1/2) and z = 0(\u03bb = 3), respectively [17]. It has\nshown that scalar perturbations decay without any oscillation in which the decay rate may\nimprint thermodynamic quantities of the 4D Lifshitz black holes. These purely damped\nmodes are different from those in the (small) Schwarzschild-AdS black hole but are similar\nto those in the 3D charged black hole [62, 63], supporting that thermodynamic nature of\n4D Lifshitz black holes is simple. However, we are still lacking for deriving the ADM mass\nof the Lifshitz-type black holes using the Hamiltonian formalism because we do not know\nLifshitz asymptotes precisely.\nThese Lifshitz black hole spacetimes have curvature singularities at r = 0, and their\nasymptotes are Lifshitz. Also there is no phase transition between Lifshitz black holes\nand z = 1 black hole, although there are crossing points between two free energies when\nconsidering the coordinate matching. This is mainly because their asymptotes are different:\nLifshitz and anti-de Sitter spacetimes.\nConsequently, we have understood thermodynamics of Lifshitz black holes and have\ndiscussed possible second order phase transitions between Lifshitz black holes and z = 1\nblack holes.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe author thanks Hyung Won Lee for helpful discussions.
