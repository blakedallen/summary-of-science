HESS J0632+057 is one of only two\nunidentified high energy gamma-ray sources which\nappear to be point-like in nature. It is possibly associated with the massive star MWC 148 and has been\nsuggested to resemble known TeV binary systems like\nLS I +61 303 or LS 5039. These binaries are rare\nand extreme (only three TeV binaries are known to\ndate), and their gamma-ray emission mechanism has\nnot been understood.\nHESS J0632+057 was observed by VERITAS, an\narray of four 12 m imaging atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes, in 2006, 2008 and 2009. Based on these\nobservations we present evidence for variability in\nthe high energy gamma-ray emission from HESS\nJ0632+057.\nKeywords: gamma rays: observations - individual\n(HESS J0632+057)\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nPoint-like gamma-ray sources stand out among the\nmany galactic VHE objects with spatially extended\ngamma-ray emission. High-mass X-ray binaries constitute the only known class of galactic objects with\nvariable point-like VHE emission; this class currently\ncontains three members only: PSR B1959-63/SS 2883\n[6], LS 5039 [7] and LS I +61 303 [9], [2].\nHESS J0632+057 is one of about \u223c 20 very high\nenergy (VHE) gamma-ray sources with no known\ncounterpart at other wavelengths. Gamma-ray emission\nwas discovered by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) during observations of the Monoceros\nLoop supernova remnant in 2004 and 2005 [8]. HESS\nJ0632+057 appears to be point-like within experimental\nresolution; the limit on the size of the emission region\nwas given as 2' (95% confidence level). The reported\nflux of gamma rays with energies above 1 TeV corresponds to about 3% of the flux of the Crab Nebula, with\na differential photon spectrum consistent with a powerlaw function with index of 2.53 \u00b1 0.26stat \u00b1 0.20sys .\nPossible associations considered by [8] are the Monoceros Loop Supernova remnant, the weak X-ray source\n1RXS J063258.3+054857, the B0pe-star MWC 148\n(HD 259440) and the unidentified GeV gamma-ray\nsource 3EG J0634+0521 [13]. An association of HESS\nJ0632+057 with the Monoceros loop SNR is unlikely\ngiven the point-like nature of the gamma-ray emission\nand the absence of correlation of possible target material\nwith the position of the VHE source [8]. Follow-up Xray observations with XMM-Newton by [15] revealed a\n\nvariable X-ray source (XMMU J063259.3+054801) with\na position compatible with HESS J0632+057 and MWC\n148. 3EG J0634+0521 is, as expected from the reported\nflux, not in the Fermi bright gamma-ray source list [1].\nTeV binaries show variable emission of gamma rays,\nlikely connected to changes in physical parameters associated with the orbital movement. VHE gamma-ray production in these binaries is explained by the acceleration\nof charged particles in accretion-powered relativistic jets\n[21], [19] or in shocks created by the collision of the\nexpanding pulsar wind with the wind from the stellar\ncompanion [18]. Subsequent inverse-Compton scattering on low-energy stellar photons (leptonic models)\nor proton-proton collisions (hadronic models) produces\ngamma-rays at GeV and TeV energies. While there has\nbeen no compact companion discovered for MWC 148,\nthe point-like nature of the VHE emission combined\nwith the variable X-ray emission can easily be explained\nby a production scenario similar to those in TeV binaries.\nAn alternative scenario is that MWC 148 is a representative of a new type of VHE emitter as proposed\nby [10] and [22]. In their picture strong magnetic fields\naround the massive star lead to magnetically channeled\nwind shocks in which second-order Fermi acceleration\nmight occur. However, it is not clear if the circumstellar\nenvironment of MWC 148 is strongly magnetized, or if\nthis acceleration mechanism is able to produce particles\nof sufficiently high energy to produce a measurable TeV\nflux.\nWe present here results from observations of HESS\nJ0632+057 with VERITAS. A detailed description of\nthese observations and of contemporaneous X-ray observations with Swift can be found in [3].\nII. O BSERVATIONS & R ESULTS\nVERITAS is an array of four imaging atmosphericCherenkov telescopes located at the Fred Lawrence\nWhipple Observatory in southern Arizona. It combines\ngood energy (15-20%) and angular (\u2248 0.1o ) resolution\nwith a large effective area (up to 105 m2 ) over a wide\nenergy range (100 GeV to 30 TeV). The field of view\nof the VERITAS telescopes is 3.5o . The high sensitivity\nof VERITAS enables the detection of sources with a\nflux of 1% of the Crab Nebula in less than 50 hours\nof observations. For more details on the VERITAS\ninstrument, see e.g. [2].\nVERITAS observed the sky around HESS J0632+057\nduring three periods in December 2006, December 2008\nand January 2009 (see Table I for details).

The location of HESS J0632+057 is\nindicated by a black triangle. The background is estimated using the \"ring background\" method. The energy threshold is 720 GeV. The circle\nat the bottom right indicates the angular resolution of the VERITAS observations.\n\nperiod, data equivalent to about 10 hours of observations\npassed data quality selection criteria, which remove\ndata taken during bad weather or with hardware-related\nproblems. Data were taken on moonless nights in wobble\nmode, wherein the source was positioned 0.5 degrees\nfrom the camera center with the offsets in different positions for different runs. The first data set (Set I) consists\nof observations taken during the construction phase of\nVERITAS with only 3 telescopes. These observations\nwere pointed towards the centre of the Monoceros\nregion (at an angular distance of \u223c 0.5o from HESS\nJ0632+057), while observations in the second and third\nset were targeted around the reported position of HESS\nJ0632+057.\nThe data analysis steps consist of image calibration\nand cleaning, second-moment parameterization of these\nimages [14], stereoscopic reconstruction of the event\nimpact position and direction, gamma-hadron separation,\nspectral energy reconstruction (see e.g. [17]) as well\nas the generation of photon sky maps. The majority\nof the far more numerous background events are rejected by comparing the shape of the event images in\neach telescope with the expected shapes of gamma-ray\n\nshowers modeled by Monte Carlo simulations. These\nmean-reduced-scaled width and mean-reduced-scaled\nlength cuts (see definition in [17]), and an additional\ncut on the arrival direction of the incoming gamma\nray (\u03982 ) reject more than 99.9% of the cosmic-ray\nbackground while keeping 45% of the gamma rays.\nThe cuts applied here are: integrated charge per image\n> 1200 digital counts (\u2248225 photoelectrons), meanreduced-scaled width/length between -1.2 and 0.5, and\n\u03982 < 0.015 deg2 (\u03982 < 0.025 deg2 for the 3-telescope\ndata set). The background in the source region is estimated from the same field of view using the \"reflectedregion\" model [4] and the \"ring-background\" model\n[5]. These cuts were chosen to provide good sensitivity\nat high energies, and to facilitate comparison with the\nresults reported in [8]. The resulting energy threshold is\n720 GeV.\nResults for each of the three VERITAS data sets, as\nwell as for the total observation can be found in Figures\n1, and 2, and Table I. Figure 1 shows a sky map of\nthe significance at energies above 720 GeV observed\nin the region around HESS J0632+057.

The\ndownwards pointing arrows show the 99% confidence limits derived here from the VERITAS data. The H.E.S.S. fluxes are taken from [8].\n\nexpected distribution from a field with no gamma-ray\nsource present. The significance at the position of HESS\nJ0632+057 is 2.1\u03c3 (1\u03c3 for an energy threshold of 1\nTeV, see Table I). There is no significant evidence for\n\u03b3-ray like events from HESS J0632+057 during the 31\nhours of observations with VERITAS. The flux upper\nlimit (E>1 TeV) for the complete data set at the 99%\nconfidence level [12] assuming a power-law like source\nspectrum with a spectral index of \u0393 = 2.5 is 2.6\u00d710\u221213\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 (about 1.1% of the flux of the Crab Nebula;\nsee Table I). This flux limit is \u223c 2.4 times lower than the\nflux reported by H.E.S.S in [8]; see Figure 2 for a lightcurve. The probability for a non-variable flux of highenergy gamma rays from HESS J0632+057 is derived\nfrom the VERITAS data and the average of the reported\nfluxes from H.E.S.S. using a \u03c72 -test. The test gives a\n\u03c72 of 15.8 with 1 degree of freedom, corresponding to\na probability of 0.007% (about 4\u03c3).\nIII. C ONCLUSIONS\nThe non-detection of HESS J0632+057 by VERITAS\nprovides evidence for variability in the flux of gammarays with energies above 1 TeV. Variability has also been\nfound in X-rays [15] [3] [11] and radio [20].\nThe VHE emission and variability can be easily\nexplained if MWC 148 is part of a binary system and\nthe high-energy photons are produced in a similar way to\nthose in LS I +61 303 or LS 5039. Particle acceleration\nand VHE-emission from massive stars with strong magnetic fields has also been suggested. A confirmation that\nMWC 148 is surrounded by sufficiently strong magnetic\nfields, along with further theoretical work to explain\nthe variability in the gamma-ray emission, is needed to\nestablish this potential new class of galactic gamma-ray\nsources.\nFuture multiwavelength observations, combined with\nresults from ground-based and space-based gamma-ray\nobservatories will provide a deeper understanding of the\ntrue nature of HESS J0634+057.\n\nIV.
