But halos are not isolated objects:\nthey merge over time, and smaller halos can survive as\nsubstructure halos (subhalos) of larger halos after infall\n(Ghigna et al. 1998; Tormen et al. 1998; Moore et al. 1999;\nKlypin et al. 1999). Thus, while galaxies form within distinct host halos at high redshift, as the Universe evolves\ngalaxies then correspond directly to dark matter subhalos\n(and since galaxies can be centrals or satellites, in our terminology a \"subhalo\" refers to a satellite substructure or\nthe central halo).\nThe evolution of subhalos involves more complicated\ndynamics than the formation of halos themselves. Satellite\nsubhalos experience severe mass stripping as they orbit, and\ndynamical friction causes their obits to sink toward halo center (Ostriker & Tremaine 1975). The evolution of galaxies is\neven more complex, involving gas dynamics, star formation,\nand various forms of feedback. Thus, the precise evolutionary relation between galaxies and subhalos remains uncerc 2009 RAS\n\ntain. In particular, what is the relation between galaxy stellar mass and subhalo dark mass? Do satellite galaxies experience appreciable star formation after infall? How long after\ninfall does a satellite galaxy survive, and what defines its final fate? How much of its stellar mass is funneled into the\ncentral galaxy in a merger, as opposed to tidally disrupting\ninto Intra-Cluster Light (ICL)?\nVarious prescriptions exist to map galaxies onto dark\nmatter subhalos. The simplest is based on subhalo abundance matching (SHAM), which assumes a monotonic relation between subhalo mass or circular velocity and galaxy\nstellar mass, populating subhalos such that one reproduces\nthe observed stellar mass function (SMF; Vale & Ostriker\n2006; Conroy et al. 2006; Shankar et al. 2006). Alternately,\nsemi-analytic models track the star formation histories of\nsubhalos across time with empirically motivated analytic\nprescriptions (see Baugh 2006, for a recent review). These\nmethods all involve assumptions regarding satellite galaxy\nstar formation after infall, the correspondence of galaxies\nwith subhalos in the case of severe mass stripping, and the\neventual fates of satellite galaxies.\nMost models assume that all satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy. Indeed, infalling satellites have long been thought to affect the mass and morpho-\n\n\f2\n\nWetzel & White\n\nlogical evolution of central galaxies (Hausman & Ostriker\n1978). However, galaxy clusters are observed to contain an\nappreciable amount of stellar material in the form of ICL,\nthough given its low surface brightness, constraints on the\nICL vary considerably, from 5 \u2212 50% of the total cluster\nlight (Lin & Mohr 2004; Zibetti et al. 2005; Gonzalez et al.\n2007; Krick & Bernstein 2007). Additionally, ICL has been\nobserved to contain significant structure, including tidal\nstreams (Mihos et al. 2005). Thus, some satellite galaxies\nare at least partially, or perhaps entirely, disrupted into the\nICL.\nIn simulations, the criteria for subhalo merging/disruption are influenced by mass and force resolution. Insufficiently resolved subhalos will disrupt artificially quickly, leading to the problem of \"over-merging\"\n(Klypin et al. 1999). A number of authors have examined\nin detail mass stripping from satellite subhalos over time\n(e.g., Maciejewski et al. 2009), however, using a fixed mass\nresolution limit for all subhalos, regardless of their infall\nmass, leads to lower mass subhalos becoming (artificially)\ndisrupted more quickly. Cosmological N -body simulations\nare now attaining sufficient mass resolution to track subhalos through many orbits and extreme mass stripping, in\nsome cases to masses much smaller than the luminous mass\nof the galaxies they would host. At infall, the dark mass\nof a subhalo is an order of magnitude higher than its stellar mass, so tidal stripping of mass from subhalos cannot\ncorrespond directly to stellar mass stripping of its galaxy.\nThus, in using dark matter subhalos to track galaxies, one\nmust be careful both to treat subhalo merging/disruption in\na self-consistent manner not dependent merely on numerical\nresolution, and to calibrate the point at which the galaxies\nthey host become merged/disrupted.\nA variety of schemes have been used to define satellite\ngalaxy merging/disruption via subhalos in simulations. Under the assumption that a galaxies survives as long as its\nsubhalo does, Wetzel et al. (2009a,b) use an absolute mass\nthreshold for all subhalos, corresponding to their resolution limit, similar to Kravtsov et al. (2004), whose model\nalso implies that subhalos coalesce if their centers come\nwithin 50 h\u22121 kpc. Several analyses assume that a satellite\ngalaxy survives the disruption of its subhalo and eventually merges with its central galaxy by imposing an analytic infall timescale to a galaxy after subhalo disruption\n(Springel et al. 2001; Kitzbichler & White 2008; Saro et al.\n2008; Moster et al. 2009). Alternately, Stewart et al. (2009)\nallow a satellite galaxy to merge before its subhalo is disrupted. They assume that a galaxy's baryonic mass is coupled to the 10% most bound mass of its subhalo and define\nsatellite merging when a satellite subhalo has lost more than\n90% of its mass at infall. Yang et al. (2009) consider a model\nwhere the survival probability of a satellite subhalo is a (decreasing) function of its infall mass to host halo mass ratio.\nOther criteria have been used in purely semi-analytical\nmodels for the evolution of subhalos. Zentner et al. (2005)\nand Taylor & Babul (2004) consider a satellite subhalo to\nbe tidally disrupted when the mass of the subhalo has been\nstripped to a value less than the mass within adis rs , where\nrs is the subhalo's NFW (Navarro et al. 1996) scale radius\nat infall, with adis = 1 (Zentner et al. 2005) or adis = 0.1\n(Taylor & Babul 2004). Assuming a typical halo concentration of c = 10, this implies that satellite subhalos will disrupt\n\nat 13% or 0.3% of their infall mass in the models, respectively \u2013 an order of magnitude difference. As an alternative to tidally disrupting, Zentner et al. (2005) consider the\nsatellite subhalo merged with the center of its halo if it comes\nwithin 5 kpc. Applying the model of Zentner et al. (2005)\nto the build-up of the ICL, (Purcell et al. 2007) allow satellite disruption to begin at \u223c 20% of infall mass (see also\nMonaco et al. 2006; Conroy et al. 2007, for models of tidal\ndisruption into the ICL).\nFinally, mass loss criteria have also been applied to\nmodelling dwarf-spheroidal galaxies in N -body simulations.\nPe\u00f1arrubia et al. (2008) find that dwarf satellites start to\nlose stellar mass to tidal stripping after 90% dark mass\nloss, but full disruption occurs only after > 99% dark mass\nloss. Macci\u00f2 et al. (2009) find good agreement between their\nsemi-analytic model and the Milky Way satellite luminosity\nfunction using adis = 0.5 \u2212 1, corresponding to 5 \u2212 13% of\nthe infall mass remaining.\nGiven the wide range in criteria for satellite merging/disruption, it is informative to explore the implications\nof various criteria and to test empirically which match well\nto the observed galaxy population. Thus, in this paper we\nexamine the extent to which galaxies can be mapped onto\nsimulated dark matter subhalos throughout their evolution.\nWe assign galaxy stellar masses and luminosities to subhalos\nby matching their number densities to observed galaxy samples. We examine the effects that different criteria for merging/disruption have on the satellite populations, including\nthe HOD and radial distribution profile. By comparing spatial clustering, satellite fractions, and cluster satellite luminosity functions to observations, we test the correspondence\nof galaxies to subhalos, and we constrain the criteria for\nsatellite galaxy merging/disruption.\nBefore continuing, we clarify the possible fates of satellite galaxies. The methods by which galaxies become removed from the satellite population are to (1) coalesce with\nthe central galaxy, (2) coalesce with another satellite galaxy,\n(3) orbit outside their host halo, or (4) tidally disrupt into\nthe ICL. As noted above, many galaxy evolution models assume only (1). As we describe below, our method for tracking subhalos in simulations intrinsically incorporates (2) and\n(3). Thus, this paper focuses on methods for removing satellite galaxies via (1) and (4). Since our tracking of dark matter subhalos does not unambiguously differentiate between\nthese (and since both can occur simultaneously), we will use\nthe term \"removal\" of satellite galaxies to indicate any mechanism that causes (1) or (4), which we refer to as \"merging\"\nand \"disruption\", respectively.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nNUMERICAL METHODS\nSimulations and Subhalo Tracking\n\nTo find and track halos and their subhalos, we use dark\nmatter-only N -body simulations using the TreePM code of\nWhite (2002). To track subhalos with high resolution, we\nuse a simulation of 15003 particles in a periodic cube with\nside lengths 200 h\u22121 Mpc. For our \u039bCDM cosmology (\u03a9m =\n0.25, \u03a9\u039b = 0.75, h = 0.72, n = 0.97 and \u03c38 = 0.8), in agreement with a wide array of observations (Smoot et al. 1992;\nTegmark et al. 2006; Reichardt et al. 2009; Dunkley et al.\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\n2009), this results in particle masses of 1.64 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299\nand a Plummer equivalent smoothing of 3 h\u22121 kpc. Initial\nconditions were generated by displacing particles from a regular grid using 2LPT at z = 250 where the RMS is 20% of\nthe mean inter-particle spacing. We stored 45 outputs evenly\nin ln(a) from z = 10 to 0, with an output time spacing of\n\u223c 600 Myr at z = 0.1, the main redshift of interest in this\npaper. Given the limited volume of this simulation, and its\nimplications for spatial clustering, we also use a separate\nsimulation of 15003 particles of size 720 h\u22121 Mpc and a particle mass of 7.67 \u00d7 109 h\u22121 M\u2299 with the same cosmology\nand halo finder, though independent initial conditions. We\nuse this larger simulation to populate our subhalo catalog\nonto a more accurate halo mass function with more accurate large-scale clustering. To examine the influence of cosmological parameters, we also populate our subhalo catalog\ninto a simulation of 10243 particles of size 500 h\u22121 Mpc with\nn = 1.0 and \u03c38 = 0.9. We explore the influence of simulation\nsize and cosmology in the Appendix.\nOur subhalo finding and tracking details are discussed\nextensively in Wetzel et al. (2009a)1 , though we have implemented a number of improvements for better performance,\nas described below. We find subhalos by first generating\na catalog of halos using the Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm (Davis et al. 1985) with a linking length of b = 0.168\ntimes the mean inter-particle spacing.2 We keep all groups\nthat have more than 50 particles, and halo masses quoted\nbelow are these FoF masses. Within these \"(host) halos\" we\nthen identify \"subhalos\" as gravitationally self-bound aggregations of at least 50 particles bounded by a density saddle\npoint, using a new implementation of the Subfind algorithm\n(Springel et al. 2001), where densities are smoothed over 32\nnearest neighbors. The \"central\" subhalo is defined as the\nmost massive subhalo within its host halo, and it includes\nall halo matter not assigned to \"satellite\" subhalos, which\nis typically \u223c 90% of the mass of the host halo. Thus, every\nsufficiently bound halo hosts one central subhalo and can\nhost multiple satellite subhalos. A subhalo position is that\nof its most bound particle, and we define the halo center as\nthat of its central subhalo.\nEach subhalo is given a unique child at a later time,\nbased on its 20 most bound particles. We track subhalo\nhistories across four consecutive outputs at a time since\nsubhalos can briefly disappear during close passage with or\nthrough another subhalo. In an improvement to the tracking method of Wetzel et al. (2009a), we now interpolate positions, velocities, and bound masses of these temporarily\ndisappearing subhalos so that our tracking scheme does not\nartificially underestimate the satellite population.\nAlso, as discussed in Wetzel et al. (2009a), subhalo histories often include cases of \"switches\": if a satellite becomes\nmore massive than the central, it becomes the central while\nthe central becomes a satellite. In these cases, there is typically not a well-defined single peak that represents the center\nof the halo profile, and the nominal center can switch back\n\n1 While of similar mass resolution, the simulation here has larger\nvolume and better force resolution than in Wetzel et al. (2009a).\n2 The longer linking length of b = 0.2 is often used, but it is more\nsusceptible to joining together distinct, unbound structures and\nassigning a halo that transiently passes by another as a subhalo.\n\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n3\n\nand forth across output times. To avoid ambiguity in assigning subhalo bound and infall mass, our tracking method\nnow eliminates switches by requiring that once a subhalo is a\ncentral, it remains so until falling into a more massive halo.\nThis history-based approach assigns as central the oldest\nsubhalo in the host halo, which would typically correspond\nto the most massive and evolved galaxy, better mapping to\nhow central galaxies are defined observationally. However,\nsince this criterion is based on subhalo history, while Subfind only uses the instantaneous density field to define the\ncentral (most massive) subhalo, the two definitions of subhalo centrality are in conflict in a small fraction cases. In\nthese cases, we defer to the history-based approach, and we\nswap the subhalo bound masses of the history-based central\nand Subfind-based central, such that the history-based central is always the most massive subhalo, and by extension\nthe most massive galaxy. We find this produces more stable\nsubhalo catalogs, in terms of individual mass histories and\nthe resultant subhalo mass function.\n2.2\n\nThe Stellar Mass of Subhalos\n\nSince our goal is to test the correspondence between subhalos and galaxies, a critical issue is how to relate stellar\nmass to a subhalo. The simplest prescription assigns stellar\nmass to a subhalo based on its instantaneous bound dark\nmass or maximum circular velocity. However, this method\nleads to satellite subhalos with significantly less concentrated radial distributions than seen for satellite galaxies\naround the Milky Way (Kravtsov et al. 2004) or galaxy\nclusters (Diemand et al. 2004). Better agreement with observations has been found using semi-analytic models of\nstar formation applied to subhalo catalogs (Springel et al.\n2001; Diaferio et al. 2001), which correlate stellar mass to\na subhalo's mass at the time the stellar component was assembled (before infall), thus indicating that it necessary to\nuse subhalo mass histories to accurately assign stellar mass\n(Gao et al. 2004).\nThe motivation for this approach comes from the\nfollowing physical model. As a halo falls into a larger\none and becomes a subhalo, tidal stripping quickly removes bound mass from the outer regions of the subhalo, giving rise to significant mass loss shortly after accretion. This behavior has been explored both in simulations (e.g., Diemand et al. 2007; Limousin et al. 2009;\nPe\u00f1arrubia et al. 2008; Wetzel et al. 2009a) and observationally through galaxy-galaxy lensing (Limousin et al.\n2007; Natarajan et al. 2007, 2009). However, the galaxy,\nbeing more compact and at the center of the subhalo, remains intact longer. Thus, dark mass stripping does not directly correspond to stellar mass stripping. The subhalo's\ngaseous component \u2013 being more diffuse and readily affected\nby ram-pressure stripping, tidal shocks, and adiabatic heating in the hot group/cluster environment \u2013 quickly becomes\nstripped after infall, halting subsequent star formation in\nthe satellite galaxy. Thus, galaxy stellar mass is expected to\ncorrelate with the subhalo's mass immediately before infall\n(Nagai & Kravtsov 2005).\nObservationally, there are a variety of claims for the\nstar formation efficiency of satellite galaxies, with significant systematic dependence on group/cluster definition\nor HOD parametrization, criteria for blue/red (star form-\n\n\f4\n\nWetzel & White\n\ning/quenched) split, and inclination effects (see Skibba 2009,\nfor a comparison of HOD color models). The HOD analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) of Zehavi et al.\n(2005) implies few faint blue satellites, and that at higher\nluminosity blue satellites are 3 \u2212 5 times less common than\nred satellites in groups. Examining group catalogs from\nSDSS, Weinmann et al. (2009) find an appreciable fraction\n(> 20%) of satellites in groups are blue, and fit a simple\nfading model where star formation in satellites quenches\n\u223c 2 Gyr after infall (see also Kang & van den Bosch 2008).\nUsing a subhalo catalog with an analytic prescription for\nstar formation and quenching, Wang et al. (2007) find an exponential decay time for satellite star formation after infall\nof \u223c 2.3 Gyr. At z \u223c 1, the clustering results of Coil et al.\n(2008) imply that immediate star formation quenching at\ninfall is likely too restrictive at higher redshift.\nHydrodynamic simulations also indicate short yet finite\ntimescales for halting star formation. High-resolution SPH\nsimulations at z \u223c 0 indicate that satellite star formation\ncan continue for up to 1 Gyr after infall (Simha et al. 2009).\nWhile the assumption that satellite gas accretion rates are\nsignificantly lower than those of central galaxies may break\ndown at z > 1 (Kere\u0161 et al. 2009), the significantly more\nrecent infall times of satellites at high redshift mediates this\nconcern. Promisingly, Nagai & Kravtsov (2005) find good\nagreement in comparing the radial profiles of subhalos in\ndark matter-only simulations selected on infall mass with\ngalaxies selected on stellar mass in dark matter plus hydrodynamic simulations.\nDespite the above uncertainties, attempts to use subhalo infall mass (or infall maximum circular velocity) to\nassign stellar mass have been successful at reproducing\nvarious observed galaxy properties at a range of redshifts\n(Berrier et al. 2006; Conroy et al. 2006; Vale & Ostriker\n2006; Wang et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2009), and so this is the\napproach we use here. The success of this method may be a\nderivative of its implicit allowance for some star formation\nafter infall, as we describe below. Furthermore, our analysis is restricted to z < 1, where the approximation of rapid\nquenching of star formation is most valid.\n2.3\n\nAssigning Infall Mass and Stellar Mass\n\nMotivated by its expected correlation with stellar mass, our\nscheme for assigning subhalo infall mass, Minf , is as follows. Centrals subhalos are assigned Minf as their current\nbound mass. This mass represents halo mass not bound\nto any satellite subhalos and so it should track the gas\nmass available to accrete onto the central galaxy. We assign to a satellite subhalo its mass when it fell into its current host halo (its subhalo mass when it was last a central subhalo). With the expectation that a subhalo merger\ncorresponds to a galaxy merger, if two satellite subhalos\nmerge, their satellite child is given the sum of their infall\nmasses. Thus, our tracking scheme inherently incorporates\nstellar mass growth though satellite-satellite mergers, an\noften-ignored but non-trivial contribution to galaxy evolution (Wetzel et al. 2009a,b; Seek Kim et al. 2009). If a satellite subhalo's orbit brings it outside its host halo, thus becoming its own distinct smaller halo, the subhalo is assigned\nits satellite parent's infall mass during the output immediately following ejection, but is assigned its current bound\n\nFigure 1. Relation between stellar mass, Mstar , and subhalo infall mass, Msub,inf , using subhalo abundance matching against\nthe observed stellar mass function of Cole et al. (2001). Solid\ncurve shows relation to our full subhalo catalog (no removal\nthreshold), dotted curve shows the relation under our maximal\nthreshold for satellite removal, and dashed curve shows the mean\nrelation when using a log-normal 0.2 dex scatter in Mstar at a\nfixed Msub,inf . Inset shows ratio Mstar /Msub,inf .\n\nmass for subsequent outputs if it remains a separate central\nsubhalo.\nWe assign stellar mass to our subhalo catalog using subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) such that by construction we recover the observed stellar mass function. We rank\norder our subhalo catalog by infall mass, and assign stellar\nmass such that n(> Minf ) = n(> Mstar ), using the observed\nstellar mass function of Cole et al. (2001). Figure 1 shows\nthe Mstar \u2212 Minf relation, for our full satellite subhalo catalog (no removal threshold) and for the maximal threshold\nfor satellite removal we consider. Since the satellite fraction\nincreases at lower mass, the discrepancy is strongest there,\nthough the offset is comparable to the error in the observed\nstellar mass function (Cole et al. 2001). The star formation\nefficiencies in Fig. 1 are in good agreement with the constrains from weak lensing of Mandelbaum et al. (2006) and\nalso agree with the Milky Way, which has stellar mass of\n5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 and a dark halo mass of about 2 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299\n(Binney & Tremaine 2008), making Mstar /Mhalo \u2248 3%. See\nMoster et al. (2009) for a detailed comparison of derived\nMstar \u2212 Msubhalo relations in the literature.\nDespite the seeming requirement for rapid satellite\nquenching after infall, SHAM does implicitly allow for satellite star formation. This is because we match stellar mass\nto satellites' infall mass at an observational epoch, not at\nthe time of infall. At z < 1, satellite times since infall are\ntypically several Gyr, and during that time satellite Minf remains fixed. Thus, if there is appreciable evolution (growth)\nin the global Mstar \u2212 Minf relation during that time, this\nwill manifest itself as stellar mass growth for satellites. We\nhave explored additional satellite star formation after infall\nby increasing all satellite infall masses by a fixed fraction,\nbut we find that this is simply degenerate with increasing\nour satellite removal threshold given in the next section.\nWhile the SHAM technique assumes a one-to-one correspondence between Minf and Mstar , there may be considc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\nerable scatter in the relation. Fits to the spatial clustering\nof luminosity or stellar mass limited galaxies samples frequently require a \"soft\" turn on in the central galaxy occupation least they overpredict the large-scale clustering,\nwhich would naturally arise from scatter in observable at\nfixed (sub)halo mass. For example, Zheng et al. (2007), applying Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling to\ngalaxies at z \u223c 0 and \u223c 1, find log-normal scatter in luminosity at fixed halo mass of 0.15 \u2212 0.3 dex, decreasing with\nincreasing halo mass, consistent with the scatter of \u223c 0.15\ndex found in the group catalogs of Yang et al. (2008) at\nz \u223c 0. Similarly, van den Bosch et al. (2007) find a lower\nlimit of 0.2 dex scatter in halo mass at fixed luminosity from\nconditional luminosity function modeling, consistent with\nthe results of More et al. (2009) from satellite kinematics.\nTasitsiomi et al. (2004) find good agreement in spatial clustering when matching subhalos to galaxies if they imposed\nsignificant scatter (0.6 dex) in luminosity at fixed subhalo\nmaximum circular velocity.\nTo examine the importance of this scatter when comparing against observed galaxy samples, we also produce a\nstellar mass catalog by imposing a fixed 0.2 dex (log-normal)\nscatter in stellar mass at fixed subhalo infall mass such that\nwe recover the observed SMF. The mean Mstar at a fixed\nMinf is shown as the dashed curve of Fig. 1. Since the mass\nfunction steeply falls with mass, introducing scatter biases\nMstar to a lower value at a fixed Minf . Higher scatter also\ncauses a stellar mass threshold to correspond to a lower effective subhalo Minf threshold.3 This effect is particularly\nstrong above Minf \u2248 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 , where the subhalo mass\nfunction starts to fall exponentially with mass.\nWe follow a similar approach to SHAM when we compare to observations of magnitude limited samples (\u00a74),\nmatching the number densities as n(> Minf ) = n(> L).\nThe two assumptions \u2013 that stellar mass and luminosity are\nset by infall mass \u2013 are not fully consistent since luminosity may evolve even if stellar mass does not. However, it is\nnot unnatural to assume the rank ordering is preserved in a\npopulation sense.\n\n3\n\nIMPACT OF SATELLITE REMOVAL\n\nAs a subhalo orbits in its host halo, dynamical friction removes energy from its orbit, bringing it closer to the central\ngalaxy, while tidal forces strip its mass. While the satellite\ngalaxy is expected to retain its stellar mass throughout most\nof the subhalo's mass stripping, eventually (though possibly in longer than a Hubble time) the galaxy will become\nremoved from the satellite population, either from merging with the central galaxy or becoming disrupted into the\ndiffuse ICL (or both). We now examine the impact different removal criteria have on the satellite population. We\nfirst focus on physically informative properties in the context of the halo model (Seljak 2000; Peacock & Smith 2000;\nBerlind & Weinberg 2002; Cooray & Sheth 2002), including\n3\n\nThis is not immediately apparent in Fig. 1, where it might\nappear that introducing scatter causes increased effective Minf\nat fixed Mstar . This is because we show the mean Mstar at a\ngiven Minf , which is qualitatively different than the mean Minf\nat a given Mstar .\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n5\n\nthe HOD and radial profile. However, since these are not\ndirect observables, we reserve detailed comparisons with observations, via spatial clustering and satellite fractions, to\nthe next section.\nAs described in the introduction, various prescriptions\nfor satellite subhalo removal have been used. We focus primarily on the one used most often in previous work, which\nis also the most straightforward given our tracking: remove\nsubhalos where the instantaneous bound mass to infall mass\nratio, finf = Mbound /Minf , falls below some threshold. While\ndark matter-only simulations do not incorporate the complex hydrodynamics involved in galaxy evolution, if a satellite galaxy's gas is stripped before its stellar component,\nthen it is conceivable that a simple criterion on subhalo dark\nmatter stripping yields a good approximation for galaxy\nstellar mass removal since both experience purely gravitational interactions. We examine a range in threshold finf\nfrom 0.01 \u2212 0.1, which as we show in \u00a74 brackets the observations, and even subhalos stripped to finf = 0.01 remain\nwell-resolved in the mass ranges we consider below. We refer to our subhalo catalog with no removal threshold as the\n\"full\" tracking model. Based on convergence tests, our subhalo catalog at z = 0.1 is robust to artificial disruption down\nto \u223c 1011.5 h\u22121 M\u2299 , so the full tracking model serves as an\nupper limit to the satellite population. We explore different\nremoval criteria in \u00a76.\n3.1\n\nHalo Occupation Distribution\n\nFigure 2 (top) shows the Halo Occupation Distribution\n(HOD) for our full tracking model (\"no finf \") and for different minimum finf = Mbound /Minf thresholds. We fit the\nHOD to\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b3\nMhalo\nNsat =\ne\u2212Mcut /Mhalo\n(1)\nM1\nwith M1 , Mcut and \u03b3 as free parameters. The slope, \u03b3, is\ngiven in Fig. 2 for each value of finf . Raising the threshold\nfor satellite removal, finf , affects satellites more in higher\nmass halos, leading to a shallower slope. As the threshold\nincreases, the HOD shoulder also becomes broader, meaning that more halos host only one galaxy. This indicates that\nsatellite subhalos of a given Minf are stripped more in higher\nmass halos, because of the stronger tidal fields and longer\ndwell times. This implies that the details of modeling satellite galaxy removal are more critical in cluster-mass halos\nthan in lower mass groups.\nThe dotted curve also shows the HOD if satellites are\nnever removed by disruption or merging with the central\ngalaxy, in other words, every infalling galaxy survives until\nz = 0.1 (which we measure by analytically retaining every infalling halo). This provides a strict upper limit to the\nHOD, contingent only upon the accuracy of the halo merger\ntrees and not on subhalo tracking and resolution. As we explore in \u00a74, this scenario is highly disfavored.\nIn the halo model, the spatial clustering on large scales\nis dominated by galaxy pairs in separate halos (\"2-halo\"\nterm), which depends on the first moment of the HOD,\nhN i(Mhalo ), where N = Nsat + 1. However, the clustering on small scales is dominated by pairs within a halo\n(\"1-halo\" term), which depends on the second moment,\nhN (N \u22121)i(Mhalo ). Figure 2 (bottom) shows the normalized\n\n\f6\n\nWetzel & White\n\nFigure 3.

The normalized second moment asymptotes to\n\u2248 1 at high halo mass, reflecting a nearly Poisson distribution, and it approaches zero at low halo mass where the\nprobability of hosting one satellite remains finite while the\nprobability of hosting two satellites goes to zero. Figure 2\nshows some dependence on removal threshold, particularly\nat high halo mass where raising the threshold increases the\nsecond moment. This is driven by correlated infall, such as\nmultiple satellites infalling as a group, and thus correlated\namounts of mass stripping. This is supported by the fact\nthat the \"no removal\" scenario (dotted curve), which represents all satellites ever accreted and is insensitive to mass\nstripping, is closer to Poisson.\n\n3.2\n\nSatellite Radial Density Profile\n\nIn addition to the number of satellites in a halo, we also\nexplore how removal thresholds affect their locations. Figure 3 (top) shows the satellite radial density profile, obtained\nfrom stacking all halos hosting the given satellite subhalos.\nRadii are defined by the distance of a satellite to its central\ngalaxy and are scaled to the host halo's virial radius, Rvir ,\nobtained from the halo FoF mass and concentration assuming a spherical NFW density profile (Rvir \u2248 R200c at z \u2248 0).\nSince halos are triaxial, particularly for those with significant substructure (recent mergers), the assumption of spherical symmetry is highly approximate (see e.g., White 2002,\nFig. 2). Additionally, subhalos preferentially lie in a plane\ndefined by their host halo's major axis (e.g., Kroupa et al.\n2005; Faltenbacher et al. 2008; Libeskind et al. 2009), behavior also found for galaxies in SDSS (Brainerd 2005) and\ndwarf satellites around the Milky Way (Metz et al. 2009).\nThis implies that the assumption of spherical symmetry is\neven less valid for subhalo populations, and that a spherical overdensity halo finder will miss satellites aligned along\nthe halo major axis. Because of these effects, we find that\nselecting satellites out to Rvir only captures 70% of the entire satellite population, while going out to 2 Rvir captures\n95%. Hence, number densities are normalized by the counts\n(using no removal threshold) within 2 Rvir .\nThe full subhalo tracking model (no removal threshold)\nshows satellite subhalos tracing the NFW profile to good\napproximation down to 0.01 Rvir , though this may represent over-resolution. Since stripping is more prominent in\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\nthe halo's dense central region, raising the threshold preferentially removes satellites from the halo center, leading to\na less concentrated profile. Figure 3 (bottom) shows the ratios of the profiles using various finf values to that of the\nfull tracking model. In all cases, significant suppression occurs below 0.4 Rvir . Interestingly, for no finf threshold does\nthe profile asymptote to unity, implying that mass stripping\naffects satellites even at large radii. The asymptotic value\nhas no significant dependence on Minf or on time since infall, indicating that this effect is not driven by satellites that\nhave passed through the halo center, but instead by subhalos\nbeing significantly stripped during or soon after infall.\nThese profiles can be compared with observationally measured satellite surface density profiles in galaxy\ngroups/clusters, a method typically based on stacking the\nprofiles of galaxies from several groups/clusters. Some work\nindicates that satellite galaxies trace well their host halo's\nNFW profile. Using a compilation of local galaxy clusters,\nDiemand et al. (2004) find that the surface density profiles\nof their member galaxies match that cluster-mass halo particles in simulations within 20% scatter and no systematic offset down to 0.05 Rvir . Similarly, van den Bosch et al. (2005)\nexamine satellite galaxies in Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), finding that they are consistent with\nfollowing their host halo's density profile, though they were\nnot able to discriminate distributions in halo cores.\nOther work indicates that, while satellite density profiles can be fit by an NFW profile, they require a lower concentration parameter than the dark matter. Using clusters\nof mass > 3\u00d71013 h\u22121 M\u2299 , Lin et al. (2004) find that galaxy\nprofiles down to 0.02 Rvir require an NFW concentration parameter of c = 2.9 \u00b1 0.2. A similar analysis by Muzzin et al.\n(2007) finds that galaxies trace NFW with c = 4.1 \u00b1 0.6\ndown to 0.5 Rvir . Examining lower mass (< 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 )\ngalaxy groups/clusters in SDSS, Hansen et al. (2005) find\nthat satellite profiles down to 0.1 Rvir can be well-fit with\nNFW profiles using c < 3, with similar results from the\n2dFGRS and SDSS group catalogs of (Yang et al. 2005).\nConcentrations of c = 3 \u2212 4 are lower than the average\nhalo concentration of c = 5 \u2212 6 for cluster-mass halos in\nour simulations. Interestingly, an NFW profile with c = 3 is\nconsistent with the satellite distribution in our simulation\ndown to 0.06 Rvir using finf = 0.01. However, differences in\nhalo virial radii estimates, density normalizations, cluster\ncentering, and galaxy luminosity thresholds make a detailed\ncomparison difficult, as highlighted by the diversity in concentrations derived observationally.\nOne strong systematic uncertainty in measuring the\nprofiles is how one chooses the halo center. Two common\nmethods of defining a cluster center are the location of the\nBrightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and the peak of X-ray\ntemperature profile. However, these are often offset by several 10's of kpc. For example, for rich clusters in the SDSS\nMaxBCG catalog, the median offset between the BCG and\nX-ray center is 58 h\u22121 kpc (Koester et al. 2007). To estimate\nhow such uncertainties propagate, we examine the degree to\nwhich centering changes the measured density at 0.1 Rvir by\ngiving the central subhalo an arbitrary offset. We find that\nan offset of 10, 25, or 50 h\u22121 kpc leads to a change of +1%,\n+4% and \u22124% in the measured density, the error growing\nrapidly with offset amplitude. Requiring less than a 10% reduction in measured density at 0.1 Rvir for clusters requires\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Satellite radial distribution probability (not divided by\nvolume) at the time of crossing below a given removal threshold,\nfinf , for satellites with Minf > 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 (Mstar > 1010.8 M\u2299 ,\nL > 0.6 L\u2217 ). For reference, solid curve shows radial distribution\nof all resolved satellites at z = 0.1.\n\nan offset of less than 60 h\u22121 kpc in the central subhalo. Such\noffset may be minimized by selecting BCGs based on their\ncolor profiles (Bildfell et al. 2008).\n3.3\n\nRadius at Removal: Merger vs. Disruption\n\nWhile Fig. 3 shows the profile of extant satellites, it does\nnot indicate the location of satellites when they became\nremoved and where their central particles, associated with\na stellar population, end up. This would provide a measure of whether satellite galaxies merge with the central\ngalaxy or disrupt into the ICL. One route to examine this\nwould be to track central \"star\" particles in subhalos after\nthey become removed and examine their overall distribution at z \u223c 0 (Murante et al. 2004; Willman et al. 2004;\nSommer-Larsen et al. 2005; Rudick et al. 2006). We take a\ndifferent approach and examine galaxy radial distribution at\nthe time of removal. While Fig. 3 shows satellites above a\nthreshold finf , we now examine satellites as they fall below\nthe threshold by selecting those within 25% of a given finf\nvalue.\nFigure 4 shows the probability distribution that a satellite is at a given scaled radius for a given finf value. For\nreference, the solid curve shows the radial distribution of all\nresolved satellites at z = 0.1, regardless of stripping. These\nare obtained from stacking all halos hosting the given satellites, though the results do not change significantly if we look\nonly at cluster-mass halos. Satellites fall below a lower finf\nthreshold at a smaller radius. This is expected in a model\nwhere subhaloes are stripped of mass as dynamical friction\nbrings their orbits to smaller radii. All thresholds display\na broad distribution with radius, since stripping will also\ndepend on satellite orbital parameters and time since infall\n(Boylan-Kolchin & Ma 2007). However, the distribution is\nmore peaked for higher finf thresholds. This likely arises because significantly stripped subhalos are closer to halo centers, where their velocities are both higher and more radial.\nIndeed, as the removal threshold is raised from finf = 0.01\nto 0.1, the average (absolute) ratio of radial to tangential ve-\n\n\f8\n\nWetzel & White\n\nlocities for the satellites drops from 1.5 to 1.1. The average\nfor the entire satellite population is between these at 1.4.\nTo understand their fates, one must know the direction in which satellites are moving as they are removed. If a\nsatellite disrupts at large radius but is moving toward halo\ncenter on a highly radial orbit, its stellar mass may still funnel to the central galaxy. As a measure of this, we examine\nthe fraction of satellites that are moving net inward towards\nhalo center as they cross below finf . We find only mild dependence on finf : as the removal threshold is raised from\nfinf = 0.01 to 0.1, the fraction of satellites moving inward\nfalls from 58% to 52%. Both are lower than the average for\nthe entire satellite population of 62%.\nThe above results imply that more highly stripped satellites are more likely moving inward and their orbits are more\nradial. However, both of these trends with mass stripping are\nmild. Fig. 4 shows that, even in our most conservative case\nof finf = 0.01, the (broad) peak of the radial probability\ndistribution occurs at \u223c 50 h\u22121 kpc. This, coupled with the\nfact that almost half of satellites at removal are moving outward and have significant tangential velocity components,\nimplies that a significant fraction of satellite galaxies disrupt into the ICL, and do not immediately merge with the\ncentral galaxy (see also Monaco et al. 2006; Conroy et al.\n2007; Purcell et al. 2007; White et al. 2007).\n\n3.4\n\nAnalytical Model for Satellite Removal\n\nAs an alternative to numerically tracking satellite subhalos,\nwe can assign infalling halos a removal time at accretion\nand examine what impact different timescales have on the\nHOD. While individual merging/disruption times depend\non satellite orbital parameters (Binney & Tremaine 2008;\nBoylan-Kolchin et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2008), we use a simpler parametrization of satellite removal time which depends\nonly on the halos' mass ratio at infall, assumed to hold for\nan ensemble average of satellites. Here, an infalling satellite\nhalo with mass Msat,inf merges with the central galaxy or\nbecomes disrupted on a timescale\ntdyn = Cdyn\n\nMhalo /Msat,inf\ntHubble\nln(1 + Mhalo /Msat,inf )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere tHubble = H \u22121 (z), Mhalo is the larger halo mass, and\nwe leave Cdyn as a free parameter to match to different satellite removal thresholds.\nFigure 5 shows the HOD for multiple Minf -limited samples and two removal thresholds, finf . Also plotted are the\nHODs using different values of Cdyn for dynamical friction.\nIn each case, the Cdyn value is chosen to best match the subhalo catalog using the given finf value. Impressively, this sole\nfree parameter can match well the subhalo catalogs across\na broad range of subhalo and halo masses, and for multiple removal thresholds. Additionally, since satellite removal\ntimes depend on their orbital parameters the relative robustness of Cdyn across a wide halo and subhalo mass range\nindicates that satellite orbits do not vary significantly with\nmass, though Fig. 5 shows some hint of shorter infall times\n(more radial orbits) for satellites in more massive halos. As\nwe shall see in \u00a75, using Eq. 2 with the same value of Cdyn\nfor the given finf also works well at higher redshift.\n\nFigure 5.\nHalo Occupation Distributions (HOD) for\nmultiple Minf -limited samples, using removal thresholds finf\n> 0.01 (top) and finf\n> 0.03 (bottom).\nMinf = 1011.5 , 1012.0 , 1012.5 , 1013.0 h\u22121 M\u2299 corresponds to\nMstar = 1010.3 , 1010.8 , 1011.1 , 1011.3 (L = 0.2, 0.6, 1.3, 2.1 L\u2217 ).\nAlso shown are HODs for different values of Cdyn for dynamical\nfriction infall time, chosen to match the subhalo catalog.\n\n4\n\nCOMPARISONS WITH OBSERVATIONS\n\nHaving examined trends in subhalo properties with varying\nremoval threshold, we now seek to constrain this freedom\nby comparing with observations. While the HOD and radial profile of the above sections are physically informative,\nthey are not direct observables. The most direct comparison\nwith data is via spatial clustering, which provides a scaledependent test of our subhalo catalog at various masses.\nIn addition, we compare to observed satellite fractions and\ncluster satellite luminosity functions, though these measures\nare less robust since they are derived from HOD modeling of\nspatial clustering or from constructing group catalogs, both\nof which are subject to systematic uncertainties in halo mass\ndefinition, HOD parametrization, and assumed cosmology.\nWe again use subhalo abundance matching, as outlined\n\u00a72.3, but while we matched to the 2dF stellar mass function\nin \u00a72.3, in this section we match to the number densities\nof r-band luminosity threshold samples in SDSS in order\nto provide a robust comparison against observed clustering\nresults. Thus, here the requirements on matching are less rec 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\n\n9\n\nstrictive, in that we need only match to a single threshold at\na time rather than reproduce the entire luminosity function.\n4.1\n\nSpatial Clustering\n\nFor spatial clustering measurements, we compare against\nthe SDSS galaxy clustering results of Zehavi et al. (2005)\nat z \u2248 0.1. To measure spatial clustering, we use the twodimensional projected galaxy auto-correlation function\nZ \u03c0max\nwp (rp ) =\nd\u03c0 \u03be(rp , \u03c0)\n(3)\n\u2212\u03c0max\n\nwhich has the advantage of effectively integrating over\nredshift-space distortions, which we incorporate using subhalo velocities. We use \u03c0max = 40 h\u22121 Mpc to match the\nmeasurements against which we compare. This value represents a good balance between integrating over redshift-space\ndistortions and minimizing correlated noise from large-scale\npower (Padmanabhan et al. 2007).\nBoth large- and small-scale clustering are sensitive to\nthe satellite population. In the limit that all galaxies are\ncentrals (a halo hosts only one galaxy), the galaxy correlation function is simply that of the mass-limited halo sample\nof the same number density. As the threshold for satellite removal decreases and the satellite population increases, highmass halos will host multiple galaxies. This serves to raise\nthe minimum halo mass of the sample (at fixed number density) while further weighting the clustering from high-mass\nhalos which host more satellites. Satellites in a halo are also\nclose spatially, to each other and to the central. Thus, satellites boost both the large- and small-scale clustering.\nThe small-scale clustering is also dependent on the radial profile of the satellites, though this sensitivity is mild.\nIn the limit that central-satellite pairs dominate, the clustering on scale rp comes from satellites at a large fraction of\nrvir in small halos and satellites nearer the center of larger\nhalos. Given the steepness of the mass function and the available halo volume, the first contribution dominates, weakening the sensitivity to the inner profile. Therefore, wp (rp ) is\nonly mildly sensitive to the radial dependence of satellite removal, though in the extreme limit of no satellites it drops\noff rapidly on small scales because of halo exclusion.\nFigure 6 shows wp (rp ) of luminosity-threshold samples\nfrom SDSS. These are compared against the Minf -threshold\nsubhalo catalog for several removal thresholds, finf , each\nmatched to the threshold number density of the SDSS sample. The magnitude-limited samples of Mr < \u221220.5 and\n< \u221221.5 correspond to subhalo Minf -limited thresholds of\nMinf \u2248 1012 and 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 , spanning a range we are\nable to probe with robust resolution and good statistics.\nImpressively, the simple prescription for satellite removal\nof finf = 0.01 \u2212 0.03, combined with simple number density matching to assign luminosity, matches well at small\nand large scales, across over an order of magnitude in Minf .\nWe find similar agreement with the Mr < \u221220.0 sample, corresponding to Minf > 1011.75 h\u22121 M\u2299 , if the \"Sloan\nGreat Wall\" (Gott et al. 2005) is removed, but because of\nthe involved uncertainty we do not include this sample to\nconstrain finf . The Mr < \u221219.5 sample, corresponding to\nMinf > 1011.5 h\u22121 M\u2299 , agrees as well but is on the edge of\nrobust resolution, so it does not provide a robust constraint.\nWe also investigate the influence of luminosity-mass\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\nFigure 6. Projected auto-correlation function at z = 0.1 for\nseveral removal thresholds, finf , (curves) each matched in number density to magnitude-limited samples in SDSS assuming\nno Lr \u2212 Minf scatter and compared with measured wp (rp ) of\nZehavi et al. (2005) (points). Top: wp (rp ) (top) and ratio of simulation to observed wp (rp ) (bottom) for Mr < \u221220.5 sample.\nBottom: Ratio of simulation to observed wp (rp ) for Mr < \u221221.0\nand < \u221221.5 samples. Mr < \u221220.5, \u221221.0, and \u221221.5 correspond\nto subhalo Minf & 1012 , 1012.5 , and 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 . Also shown is\nthe reduced \u03c72 of the fit to observation for each finf .\n\nscatter. Because of the steepness in the subhalo mass function, adding scatter lowers the effective Minf threshold at a\nfixed number density, and this effect is stronger at higher\nMinf (see Fig. 1). Thus, Fig. 7 shows wp (rp ) for most luminous samples, assuming 0.2 dex scatter in luminosity at fixed\nMinf . As expected from the decreased effective mass threshold, adding scatter reduces the clustering amplitude, and\n\n\f10\n\nWetzel & White\n\nFigure 7. Same as Fig. 6 (bottom), but luminosity is matched\nto subhalos assuming 0.2 dex scatter in Lr at fixed Minf .\n\nthe effect is stronger at larger scales. However, the goodness\nof agreement between observations and finf = 0.01 \u2212 0.03 is\nnot significantly changed, except for the Mr < \u221221.5 sample\nwhere agreement is improved somewhat, suggesting necessary scatter at high mass.\n\n4.2\n\nSatellite Fraction\n\nWe next compare against the observed satellite fraction: the\nfraction of galaxies above a given luminosity threshold that\nare satellites. Since the satellite fraction is an integral over\nthe HOD, it integrates the effects of \u00a73 into a single number\nas a function of Minf : as the threshold for removal is raised,\nthe satellite fraction drops.\nWe compare against a variety of values derived from\nSDSS and 2dFGRS, all at a median z = 0.05 \u2212 0.1. Again\nwe stress that determining satellite fractions from observations requires significant modeling. Zehavi et al. (2005) and\nZheng et al. (2007) satellite fractions were both derived from\nfitting HODs to the number density and spatial clustering\nof galaxy samples from SDSS, though they used different\nHOD parametrizations. Tinker et al. (2007) used a similar technique applied to 2dFGRS. Additionally, Yang et al.\n(2008) satellite fractions were obtained directly from the\nSDSS group catalogs of Yang et al. (2007).\nFigure 8 (top) shows observed satellite fractions, abundance matched to our subhalo catalog and plotted as a\nfunction of Minf . The observationally-based analyses yield\nsimilar results, which also agree with values from galaxygalaxy lensing (Mandelbaum et al. 2006), though there is\nconsiderable scatter. At the low mass end, the amplitude\nfrom Tinker et al. (2007) is anomalously low, which may be\ndriven by the fact that the 2dFGRS is a blue-selected samples and thus could be missing a large population of satellites\nthere, since satellites are preferentially redder than centrals\n(van den Bosch et al. 2008). Given the consistency of the\n\nFigure 8. Satellite fraction vs. infall mass. Top: Using various\nremoval thresholds, finf , from the subhalo catalog. Points show\nobservationally derived values, matched in number density to\nour subhalo catalog, from Zehavi et al. (2005) (Z05), Zheng et al.\n(2007) (Z07), Tinker et al. (2007) (T07), and Yang et al. (2008)\n(Y08). Bottom: Using the analytic model for satellite halo infall\nof Eq. 2 and various values of Cdyn for dynamical friction. Good\nagreement with observation (no rollover) continues at low mass\nsince the analytic model depends only on resolving halos prior to\ninfall. Dotted curve shows keeping all satellites ever accreted.\n\nthree other samples at low mass, we consider their values\nmore robust in that regime. At the high mass end, the satellite fractions from Zheng et al. (2007) show an upturn; since\nthe satellite fraction is expected to decrease with mass and\nthe amplitude of the highest two mass bins are considerably\ndifferent than the other samples, we will not consider them\nas robust data points.\nAlso shown are satellite fractions from our subhalo catalog for various removal thresholds, finf . Since the satellite\nfraction should rise with decreasing galaxy mass, the rollover\nat low mass clearly shows the limits of numerical resolution\nbelow Minf = 1011.5 h\u22121 M\u2299 . Above this mass, finf \u2248 0.03\nworks well across over two decades in Minf , consistent with\nresults from spatial clustering.\nNote that the satellite fraction remains non-zero up to\nMinf \u223c 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 , resulting from low redshift clustercluster mergers (e.g. Cohn & White 2005). This implies that\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\n\u223c 10% of galaxy clusters should be expected to host a\nsatellite BCG, as supported by observations which shown a\nnumber of clusters hosting BCG-BCG pairs (e.g., Liu et al.\n2009). In a sample of rich clusters from the SDSS MaxBCG\ncatalog, 15% host two BCGs (Koester et al. 2007).\nWe can also use our analytic model for satellite removal\nas in \u00a73.4 to examine how different Cdyn values for dynamical friction affect the satellite fraction, as shown in Fig. 8\n(bottom). Discounting the results of Tinker et al. (2007) at\nlow mass, which exhibit a flattening that is not seen in any of\nthe other samples, our simple analytic model provides good\nagreement with observations using Cdyn = 0.2 \u2212 0.3. This\nprovides a consistent picture, since using Cdyn = 0.2 \u2212 0.3\nmatches the subhalo HOD using finf = 0.01 \u2212 0.03 (Fig. 5),\nwhich is also the range of finf that best matches observed\nclustering. Additionally, this analytic model works well even\nbelow our mass threshold for reliably tracking satellite subhalos, showing no rollover at low mass since it depends only\non resolving halos prior to infall.\nThe dotted curve in Fig. 8 (bottom) shows the satellite\nfraction if satellites are never removed (merge with central\nor tidally disrupt), which we measure by analytically retaining every infalling halo, as in Fig. 2. The slight deficit\ncompared with the full subhalo catalog at high mass arises\nbecause satellites in this analytic model do not gain mass\nvia merging with other satellites. While this \"no removal\"\nscenario provides a reasonable estimate at high mass, where\nhalos have formed only recently and so their average times\nsince infall are short, it grossly overpredicts the satellite fraction at lower mass. This demonstrates the clear failure of a\nscenario in which satellite galaxies never merge/disrupt.\nOverall, we find that Cdyn \u2248 0.25 both matches well to\nthe satellite removal criteria that agrees with spatial clustering, and it directly produces satellite fractions in agreement\nwith observations. Conroy et al. (2007) apply a similar dynamical infall model as ours to halo merger trees to examine\nthe growth of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) population.\nThey find that Cdyn = 0.1 fit observations well, though they\nwere unable to put precise constraints on this value. Figure 8 (bottom) shows that such a value would underpredict\nthe observed satellite fraction across a broad mass range.\nCdyn = 0.2 also agrees well with a similar analysis by\n(Wetzel et al. 2009a), who match the evolution of satellite\nsubhalos in simulations at z & 1. They also pointed out\nthat, given typical satellite orbital circularity distributions\n(Zentner et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2008), the detailed fits\nto dynamical friction infall times of Boylan-Kolchin et al.\n(2008) and Jiang et al. (2008) predict Cdyn = 0.06 and\n0.14, respectively. The latter value, obtained from an analysis of a cosmological simulation not dissimilar from ours,\nis marginally consistent with our results. However, the former clearly is not. This can partially be attributed to\nthe different mass dependence in the parametrization of\nBoylan-Kolchin et al. (2008): they used a fit similar to Eq. 2\nbut with (Mhalo /Msat,inf )1.3 in the numerator. Their added\nexponent factor doubles their merging/disruption time (with\nrespect to ours) for a 10 : 1 mass ratio merger. While this\ndoes provide better agreement, it still leads to a 10 : 1 infall timescale that is half of ours. Given that their fit was\nobtained from an analysis of significantly higher resolution\nmergers of two isolated, spherical (Hernquist profile) halos,\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n11\n\nthis highlights the importance of realistic cosmological settings for calibrating satellite merging/disruption timescales.\nFinally, we note that the above analytic model of satellite removal is dependent on halo definition. In particular, if\nhalos are defined to have a larger radius, then satellites will\naccrete sooner and hence the analytic removal time will be\nlonger. As compared with the commonly used FoF(b = 0.2),\nrb=0.168 \u2248 0.86 rb=0.2 . Thus, the best-match Cdyn \u2248 0.25\nvalues represents a lower limit to that of satellites in halos\nusing FoF(b = 0.2).4\n\n4.3\n\nCluster Satellite Luminosity Function\n\nSince the correlation function and satellite fraction conflate\nsatellites within a variety of host halo masses, we finally test\nour subhalo catalog by examining satellites specifically in the\ndensest environments: galaxy clusters. We compare the luminosity function of satellites within galaxy clusters in our\nsimulation with that determined from the SDSS MaxBCG\ncatalog (Hansen et al. 2009). Here, we abundance match our\nsubhalo catalog at z = 0.25 to the SDSS i-band galaxy luminosity function at that redshift (Sheldon et al. 2009), from\nwhich the cluster catalog in Hansen et al. (2009) is drawn.\nAdditionally, we assume 0.15 dex scatter in luminosity at\nfixed subhalo mass. We then compute the luminosity function of satellites in clusters of a given richness, where we define richness as in Hansen et al. (2009) as the number of red\nsequence satellite galaxies with L > 0.4L\u2217 within the cluster virial radius. We use their fit to the red galaxy fraction\nvs. cluster richness (their Eq. 13) to scale our total satellite\ncounts to those of red galaxies (this fraction is 65 \u2212 80% in\nthe richness range we probe).\nFigure 9 shows the results of our subhalo catalog, using a removal threshold of finf > 0.02, as compared with\nHansen et al. (2009). We find good agreement for both high\nand low bins of cluster richness. Since Mi = \u221219 corresponds\nto a subhalo infall mass of 1011.4 h\u22121 M\u2299 , the agreement in\nFig. 9 across a wide range of luminosities demonstrates that\nour subhalo catalog, with a model for merging/disruption,\nsuccessfully traces the galaxy population in the densest environments down to our expected numerical resolution threshold. Figure 9 does exhibit some excess of very bright cluster\nsatellites in our catalog, though the limited number of massive clusters in our simulation volume precludes a definitive\ntest in that regime.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nHIGH REDSHIFT\nHOD and Analytic Removal\n\nExamining the effects of removal thresholds on the HOD at\nhigher redshift, we find little change in the fractional reduction in the satellite HOD as finf is increased. This supports a\n4\n\nIn principle, changing halo definition can also change the mass\nratio in Eq. 2 and hence the removal time, since halo concentration scales weakly with mass. However, the mass enhancement\nfrom FoF(b = 0.168) to FoF(b = 0.2) is nearly independent of\nconcentration and redshift. The relation to spherical overdensity\nhalos will depend on concentration and redshift (see White 2001,\nfor more on halo conversion).\n\n\f12\n\nWetzel & White\n\nFigure 9. Luminosity function of satellites in galaxy clusters\nat z = 0.25, for lower (top) and higher (bottom) cluster richness\nbins. Subhalos are abundance matched to the SDSS i-band luminosity function (Sheldon et al. 2009), assuming 0.15 dex scatter\nin luminosity at fixed subhalo mass, and satellites retained if their\nfinf > 0.02. Solid curve shows fit to SDSS MaxBCG catalog from\nHansen et al. (2009).\n\npicture where satellite subhalo mass stripping is quite rapid\nafter infall, such that the shorter average times since infall\nat higher redshift do not lead to a significantly less stripped\nsatellite subhalo population.\nWe also examine our analytic model for satellite removal\ntimescale (Eq. 2) at higher redshift. In particular, we test the\nvalidity of the scaling of tdyn with tHubble . Figure 10 shows\nthe HOD at z = 1 and 2 for both the subhalo catalog and\nanalytic model, using the same finf and Cdyn values as in\nFig. 5 (bottom). The agreement at all host halo and satellite\nmasses remains relatively robust given the simplicity of the\nmodel. This agreement is partially a result of the decreasing dependence of the analytical model on Cdyn at higher z,\nwhen halos of a given mass have formed and been accreted\nmore recently, so allowing longer infall times does not significantly increase the number of satellites. This is demonstrated by decreasing difference in the HOD for Cdyn = 0.2\n(dashed curves) as opposed to the \"no removal\" scenario\n(dotted curves). Moreover, using Cdyn & 0.3 produces no\nadditional enhancement in the HOD at z > 2.\n\nFigure 10. Same as Fig. 5, but at z = 1 (top) and z = 2 (bottom). A given Cdyn value maps nearly as well to a given removal\nthreshold, finf , at high z as at z = 0.1. Dotted curves show keeping all satellites ever accreted. At higher z, this case exhibits less\nexcess with respect to the dynamical infall prescription.\n\nThis result has clear implications for modelling galaxy\nevolution at high redshift. Since the details in modeling\nsatellite galaxy infall matter less at higher redshift, nearly\nall uncertainty in understanding galaxy evolution at high\nredshift lies in the gas/radiation physics and not in the dynamics of dark matter.\n\n5.2\n\nSpatial Clustering at z \u223c 1\n\nWe also examine whether our criteria for satellite removal\nhold at higher redshift by comparing with galaxy clustering\nresults at z \u223c 1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2) survey (Coil et al. 2006), as shown\nin Fig. 11. Here, we use abundance matching to match\nthe number densities of B-band luminosity threshold galaxy\nsamples in DEEP2. We find that using abundance matching\nwith no scatter in the LB \u2212 Minf relation causes our subhalo\ncatalog to exhibit significant excess in clustering as compared with DEEP2 for all but the lowest few rp bins. We\nfind improved agreement using significant (0.6 dex) scatter, as shown for two luminosity thresholds corresponding\nto subhalos above our robust resolution limit. Using even\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\n\n13\n\nthe discrepancy may not be statistically significant. Since\nwe do not have a covariance matrix for the observations, we\nare unable to determine the goodness-of-fit.\nInterestingly, Conroy et al. (2006) find good agreement\nwith DEEP2 clustering using similar method based on\nabundance matching against subhalo catalogs. Their better\nagreement (lower clustering) may stem from their different\nassumed cosmology (\u03c38 = 0.9), and/or their simulation box\nsizes (80 and 120 h\u22121 Mpc), significantly smaller than the\none used here. Suggestively, a recent HOD analysis using\ncolor information finds a similar clustering trend as ours,\nnamely, good agreement at small scales but excess clustering at rp & 1 h\u22121 Mpc (Tinker & Wetzel 2009).\nThus, while our satellite removal criteria are consistent\nwith clustering at z \u223c 1 in DEEP2 at rp < 1 h\u22121 Mpc\ngiven LB \u2212 Minf scatter, the above uncertainties and lack of\nagreement in large-scale clustering do not allow us to obtain\nstrong constraints from these higher redshift data.\n5.3\nFigure 11. Projected auto-correlation function for several removal thresholds, finf , as compared with the observed clustering\nat z \u223c 1 of Coil et al. (2006). MB < \u221219.5, \u221220.5 samples correspond to subhalo Minf & 1011.5 , 1012.0 h\u22121 M\u2299 . Abundance\nmatching here assumes 0.6 dex scatter in LB at fixed Minf .\n\nlarger scatter improves the agreement on large scales, but it\nunderpredicts clustering on smaller scales.\nAt z \u223c 1, the small scale (rp < 1 h\u22121 Mpc) clustering\nprovides a consistent picture with the results at z = 0.1,\nfavoring a removal threshold of finf = 0.01 \u2212 0.05. However,\ndespite the large luminosity-mass scatter, our subhalo catalog overpredicts the clustering as compared with DEEP2 on\nlarge scales. Curiously, at face value, DEEP2 clustering at\nrp \u223c 10 h\u22121 Mpc favors a model with no satellite galaxies.\nThere are a number of possible reasons for why\nDEEP2 suggests increased scatter and/or reduced clustering. DEEP2 selects on B-band luminosity, which is more susceptible to recent star formation, and since satellites at z \u223c 1\nare redder than centrals at a given stellar mass (Zheng et al.\n2007; Tinker & Wetzel 2009), this could bias the clustering\nlow since satellites preferentially live in more massive halos,\nwhich are more highly biased. As discussed in \u00a72.2, it is possible that the L \u2212 Minf relation has more scatter at higher\nredshift. However, large scatter alone is unable to match the\nclustering at all scales. Clustering in DEEP2 could be biased\nlow because their selection criteria miss \u223c 10% of red galaxies in their survey volume, although this effect is likely to be\nmild both because red galaxies form the minority of the population at all luminosity thresholds and because wp (rp ) is\nnearly the same for red and blue galaxies at rp \u223c 10 h\u22121 Mpc\n(Coil et al. 2008). Alternately, if DEEP2 is missing an appreciable number of galaxies in their survey volume (regardless of color), our abundance matching method will correlate to the observed galaxies artificially high subhalo masses,\nleading to enhanced clustering. Or the disagreement could\nbe a statistical fluctuation. The DEEP2 survey volume of\n\u223c(100 h\u22121 Mpc)3 is susceptible to sampling variance, and\nthe clustering at different scales are highly correlated, so\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\nEvolution of the Satellite Fraction\n\nFinally, we explore how the satellite fraction evolves with\nredshift. Figure 12 (top) shows the satellite fraction as a\nfunction of Minf at various redshifts, using finf = 0.02. At\na fixed infall mass, the satellite fraction monotonically increases with time, arising from the decreasing dynamical\nfriction infall time with respect to the typical halo merger\ntimescale (Wetzel et al. 2009a). The evolution of the rollover\nat low mass, arising from numerical disruption, indicates\nthat the resolution limit decreases with higher redshift, when\nsatellites have been accreted more recently.\nSince the Mstar \u2212Minf relation evolves with time, Fig. 12\n(bottom) shows the satellite fraction instead as a function\nof Mstar , obtained by abundance matching against the SMF\nof Cole et al. (2001) at z = 0.1 and Marchesini et al. (2009)\nat higher redshift. Points show the satellite fraction at fixed\nMinf values. At high mass, the Mstar \u2212Minf relation exhibits\nonly mild evolution, but at lower mass, subhalos at a fixed\nMinf grow rapidly in Mstar .\nThis result has two important implications. First, in\nexamining a galaxy population of fixed stellar mass, simulation resolution becomes even less of a limitation at higher\nredshift than Fig. 12 (top) would indicate, since at the low\nmass end galaxies of a fixed Mstar move to a higher Mstar\nwith redshift. This is evidenced by the lack of rollover in the\nstellar mass satellite fraction at higher redshift.\nSecond, the growth of Mstar at fixed Minf for Mstar <\n1011 M\u2299 demonstrates how SHAM implicitly allows for satellite star formation. For example, if a satellite were accreted\nat z = 1 with Mstar = 4 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , following the points of\nfixed Minf in Fig. 12 (bottom) shows that SHAM-assigned\nstellar mass would increase by \u223c 20% by z = 0.1.\n\n6\n\nCOMPARISONS WITH OTHER REMOVAL\nCRITERIA\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, various authors have used\ndifferent criteria to define satellite galaxy removal via dark\nmatter subhalos. Here, we examine how other criteria compare against our fiducial case, the subhalo bound mass to\ninfall mass ratio, finf .\n\n\f14\n\nWetzel & White\n\nFigure 12. Satellite fraction vs. mass at various redshifts, using a removal threshold of finf = 0.02. Top: Subhalos binned\nin Minf . The turnover in satellite fraction occurs at lower\nMinf at higher z, indicating that resolution effects less critical at higher z. Bottom: Subhalos binned in Mstar , based\non abundance matching. Points indicate values at fixed Minf\nof 1011.75 , 1012.0 , 1012.5 , 1013.0 h\u22121 M\u2299 , highlight the evolving\nMstar \u2212 Minf relation.\n\nAs shown by our full tracking scheme (keeping subhalos\nto 50 particles), using a fixed mass criterion can reasonably\nmatch observations if the mass threshold corresponds to 1 \u2212\n5% of the infall mass. As simulations increase in resolution,\nit thus becomes increasingly necessary to model for satellite\nremoval before subhalos reach numerical disruption.\nModels which remove a satellite subhalo after its mass\nhas been stripped to a value less than the mass within a fixed\nfraction (adis ) of its NFW scale radius (e.g., Taylor & Babul\n2004; Zentner et al. 2005; Macci\u00f2 et al. 2009) are largely degenerate with our fiducial finf criterion, since subhalo concentration scales only weakly with mass. For a typical halo\nconcentration of c = 10, our results suggest adis \u2248 0.3,\nwithin the range 0.1 \u2212 1 often assumed.\nGiven that total baryonic to dark mass ratio in a halo\nis nearly 10%, Stewart et al. (2009) assumed that a satellite\nmerges with its central galaxy when it drops below 10%\nof infall mass. However, we find that finf = 0.1 noticeably\nunderpredicts the satellite population. A lower threshold is\nneeded, likely both because the stellar to dark mass ratio is\n\nsignificantly lower (\u223c 4%), and because any baryonic mass\nwill be more compact than the 10% most bound dark mass.\nSince the Mstar /Minf ratio varies with subhalo mass\n(Fig. 1), it is not obvious that our best-fit removal threshold,\nbased on subhalos of Minf > 1011.5 h\u22121 M\u2299 (L > 0.2 L\u2217 ),\ncan be simply extrapolated to modelling dwarf-spheroidal\nsystems around the Milky Way. However, our results are\nconsistent with allowed dark mass stripping fractions to\nmatch the Milky Way population (Pe\u00f1arrubia et al. 2008;\nMacci\u00f2 et al. 2009).\nInstead of mass stripping-based criteria, we also examine criteria based on satellite tidal radius or distance\nfrom halo center/central galaxy. To obtain precise centralsatellite separations, we linearly extrapolate satellite positions between subsequent outputs to find the minimum\nseparation. For succinct comparison, we compare satellite\nfractions against finf = 0.02, the fiducial criterion which\nmatches well to observations as shown above.\nAs was shown in Fig. 4, a correlation exists between a\nsatellite's distance from its central galaxy and falling below a\ngiven finf value. Thus, Fig. 13 (top) shows satellites removed\nwhen coming within a fixed physical distance from the central galaxy. Despite the stripping-distance correlation, compared with our fiducial case this model underpredicts satellites at low mass and overpredicts at high mass. Combined\nwith the results from our full tracking model (fixed mass\nthreshold), this implies that any successful removal criteria\nmust scale with the mass or radius of the satellite subhalo.\nIn this vein, the middle panel shows satellite removal if\na satellite subhalo's tidal (Jacobi) radius falls below a given\nvalue, where\n\u0014\n\u00151/3\nMsat\nrtid = A\nr\n(4)\n3Mhalo (< r)\nand where r is the physical separation from satellite to\nhalo center, Msat is the instantaneous bound satellite mass,\nMhalo (< r) is the halo mass within r, and A is a constant that accounts for the host halo's density profile (see\nBinney & Tremaine 2008, Eq. 8.107, 8.108). Assuming that\na satellite disrupts when within its host halo's inner NFW\nprofile lets us set A = 1.4, and we measure Msat and Mhalo (<\nr) directly from our simulation. As a simple analytic alternative, we have investigated modelling the halos at infall as\nisothermal spheres (as applied to Binney & Tremaine 2008,\nEq. 9.86), which produces similar results. Figure 13 (middle) shows the satellite fraction for tidal radii motivated by\ntypical galaxy sizes. Similar to using fixed satellite distance,\nthis method predicts too shallow of a dependence on satellite\ninfall mass, likely a manifestation of its weak (1/3 power)\nscaling with mass ratio.\nFinally, we consider a removal criterion defined simply\nby a linear scaling relation between satellite halo \u2013 host halo\nmass and radius at infall. Specifically, removal occurs when\n\u0013\n\u0012\nMsat,inf\nRhalo,vir\n(5)\nr<B\nMhalo\nwhere B is some constant. Note that if satellite and host halos are isothermal spheres, such that M (< r)/Mvir = r/Rvir ,\nand B = 1, the above criterion is met when the halo mass\ninterior to r equals the satellite's infall mass. Figure 13 (bottom) shows the results using B = 1 and 0.5. This model\nprovides good agreement with our fiducial case because of\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\n\n15\n\nthe strong (linear) scaling with mass ratio, with B = 0.5\nwell matching the overall amplitude. Thus, this method may\nprovide a useful approximation for simple analytic models\nof satellite evolution.\nVarious works using semi-analytic models grafted onto\nsubhalo populations use an analytic model to track satellite galaxies after subhalo disruption in order to match\nsmall-scale galaxy clustering at z \u223c 0 (e.g., Springel et al.\n2001; Kitzbichler & White 2008; Saro et al. 2008). While\nthis method does provide a means to overcome limited mass\nresolution, its fundamental assumption, that all satellite\ngalaxies eventually merge with the central galaxy, is not\nconsistent with the dynamics of subhalos at removal that\nwe find, or with observed ICL fractions.\nAs an alternative, Henriques et al. (2008), using semianalytic catalogs from the Millennium simulation, consider\nall satellite galaxies at z = 0 whose subhalo has fallen below\nnumerical resolution as tidally disrupting into ICL (implying that central-satellite mergers do not occur). While this\nrepresents a highly simplified model, entirely contingent on\na fixed numerical resolution mass, it does provide better\nagreement with the observed faint end of the galaxy luminosity function and allows for contribution to ICL consistent\nwith observations. Seek Kim et al. (2009) use the same semianalytic models and find better agreement with observed\nspatial clustering by assuming that satellite luminosity is\ninstantly reduced at infall to roughly the ratio of satellite\nhalo to host halo mass. This model implies nearly total stellar mass stripping of low mass satellites immediately upon\ninfall, in disagreement with our method which tracks mass\nloss over time across all satellite masses self-similarly.\nInterestingly, Moster et al. (2009) use SHAM applied\nto a simulation of similar mass and force resolution to ours,\nand they find that they need to analytically track satellite\ngalaxies after subhalo disruption to match galaxy clustering, in opposition to our findings. This difference may arise\nbecause their simulation box size is 100 h\u22121 Mpc, and as we\ndiscuss in the Appendix, simulation volumes smaller than\n200 h\u22121 Mpc tend to underpredict subhalo spatial clustering on all scales.\n\n7\n\nFigure 13. Satellite fraction vs. subhalo infall mass, using various removal criteria. Top: Satellite removed when it passes within\na given physical distance of its central galaxy. Middle: Satellite\nremoved when its tidal radius falls below the given value. Bottom: Satellite removed when it passes within radius at which both\nsatellite subhalo and host halo have same interior mass (ignores\nsatellite mass stripping), both using NFW profiles from simulation and approximating halos as isothermal spheres.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe use a high-resolution dark matter-only N -body simulation of cosmological volume to track halos and their substructure, examining the fates of satellite galaxies. Under\nthe assumption that galaxies reside at the centers of subhalos and that stellar mass is related to infall mass, we assign\nstellar masses to subhalos through abundance matching,\nsuch that we recover the observed stellar mass function. Our\nsubhalo catalog intrinsically incorporates satellite-satellite\nmergers and satellite orbiting beyond their halo radius.\nThus, we examine different criteria for satellite galaxy removal (tidal disruption or merging with the central galaxy),\nusing only information from the dark matter density field,\nand focusing primarily on the criterion based on the subhalo bound mass to infall mass ratio, finf = Mbound /Minf .\nWe highlight our main results as follows:\n\u2022 Raising the threshold for removal, finf , causes a reduction in the satellite HOD at all masses, such that more halos\n\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\f16\n\nWetzel & White\n\nhost only one galaxy. Additionally, higher finf leads to a shallower HOD slope, implying that modelling satellite removal\nis more important in higher mass halos.\n\u2022 Disrupted/merged satellites reside primarily in the inner halo regions, and raising the removal threshold leads to\na less concentrated satellite density profile. A small fraction\nof satellites are disrupted out to the halo virial radius.\n\u2022 Most satellites fall below the removal threshold at a\nhalo radius of 40 \u2212 100 h\u22121 kpc, the distance increasing with\nfinf . The orbits of these satellites are only mildly radial and\nnearly half are directed outward from halo center, indicating\nthat a substantial fraction of satellites are disrupted into the\nICL as opposed to merging with the central galaxy.\n\u2022 Our subhalo catalog matched in number density to observed galaxy samples at z = 0.1 reproduces well the projected correlation function at all scales and over a large range\nin subhalo masses using finf = 0.01 \u2212 0.03. Using reasonable\n(0.2 dex) luminosity-mass scatter does not change our results appreciably.\n\u2022 Our subhalo catalog also agrees well with observed\nsatellite fractions and cluster satellite luminosity functions\nfor similar values of finf . A scenario in which satellite galaxies never merge or disrupt is not feasible.\n\u2022 Methods for satellite removal based on physical separation from central galaxy or tidal radii predict too shallow\nof a dependence on subhalo mass. Better agreement arises\nfrom methods that scale linearly with subhalo mass/size.\n\u2022 A simple analytical model for satellite removal\ntimescale, based only on the satellite-halo mass ratio at infall and scaling with the Hubble time, reproduces well both\nour subhalo catalog up to high redshift, and the observed\nsatellite fraction at z = 0.1. The best-fit Cdyn \u2248 0.25 implies a substantially longer removal time than that derived\nfrom other dynamical friction models.\nWe emphasize that our results are based on examining subhalo merging/disruption in dark matter-only simulations, and the best-fit criteria to observations may change\nsomewhat for simulations incorporating hydrodynamics and\naccurate galaxy stellar profiles. For example, gas dynamics\ncan affect orbits of the subhalos themselves, though this appears to be small (Jiang et al. 2009). More importantly, a\nrealistic subhalo stellar component is likely to be more compact and immune to stripping than the dark matter. Recent\nworks find some enhancement of satellite subhalo survivability in SPH simulations with star formation than in dark\nmatter-only simulations, though the strength of this effect\nis unclear (Dolag et al. 2009; Weinberg et al. 2008).\nThe largest source of uncertainty in our method is the\nassignment of stellar mass/luminosity to subhalos. While\nabundance matching to subhalo infall mass does allow for\n\"passive\" satellite star formation as the Mstar \u2212 Minf relation evolves, it may underpredict the star formation in\nsatellite galaxies, particularly at higher redshift. We have investigated how additional satellite star formation after infall\ninfluences our results by increasing all satellite infall masses\nby a fixed fraction. Because our removal criterion is based\non mass stripping, this is largely degenerate with increasing\nremoval threshold. Thus, to the extent that satellites experience significant star formation after infall (beyond what is\nimplicitly in SHAM), our best-fit removal threshold may represent a slightly underestimate. A more detailed prescription\n\nfor star formation quenching can be related to environmental dependence of galaxy color, though we save incorporating\nproperties beyond stellar mass or luminosity to future work.\nDespite these uncertainties, our best fit mass stripping criterion for removal provides a consistent picture with\ngalaxy stellar mass to dark mass ratios. Abundance matching at z = 0.1 gives Mstar /Msub,inf \u2248 4% for Minf \u223c\n1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 (Fig. 1). This implies that all of the stellar mass\nis only slightly more compact than the most bound dark\nmatter of the same mass. Thus, it is unlikely that galaxies\nwithin subhalos that fall below finf \u223c 0.01 can remain intact. If satellite galaxies have been stripped of most of their\ngas, then the gravitational dynamics of the stellar material\nwill simply follow that of the dark matter, and since the dark\nmass fraction within a galaxy's radius is close to unity, dark\nmass stripping below finf \u223c 0.01 must correspond to some\namount of baryonic stripping. While our binary model of\nmerging/disruption is clearly an oversimplification, it does\nprovides a good match to current observations.\nFinally, our results imply strong constraints on simulations needed for robust subhalo populations, both in resolution and volume. Taking finf = 0.01 as a conservative\nlimit of our removal threshold and \u223c 30 particles as minimum resolution for tracking subhalos in dense environments,\nthis implies that at least \u223c 3000 particles are needed at infall to robustly track satellites, which is consistent with our\nconvergence tests on subhalo mass functions at z = 0.1.\nThis resolution requirement is relaxed somewhat at high\nredshift (z > 1), where average satellite times since infall\nare shorter so satellite have experienced less stripping. Additionally, our tests on simulation volumes indicate that box\nsizes < 200 h\u22121 Mpc have considerable difficulty reproducing representative halo mass functions and spatial clustering. Taken together, these resolution and volume effects necessitate a wide dynamical range, using several billion particles, for simulations used to investigate galaxy evolution\nand galaxy large-scale structure.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank J.

While our\nhigh-resolution 200 h\u22121 Mpc simulation is able to track halo\nsubstructure with high fidelity, its limited volume poses\nproblems for accurately recovering the high mass end of the\nhalo mass function and large-scale spatial clustering. This\nis not merely an issue of limited statistics and sample variance: by imposing mean density on a limited volume, we\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\n\fWhat determines satellite galaxy disruption?\n\n17\n\nare not probing an entirely representative realization of the\nUniverse, and the limited volume truncates power on scales\nlarger than the box size.\nComparing the halo statistics of the 200 h\u22121 Mpc and\n720 h\u22121 Mpc simulations (which have different resolution\nbut the same cosmology and halo finder, as described in\n\u00a72.1), we find that the halo mass function at z = 0.1 in\nthe 200 h\u22121 Mpc simulation is 5% lower than that in the\n720 h\u22121 Mpc simulation from 3 \u00d7 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 (the resolution limit of the larger simulation) to 3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ,\nwith no dependence on mass in this interval. This implies\nthat the deficit is driven not by resolution effects, but instead by truncated large-scale power and sample variance.\nAbove 3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 , the 200 h\u22121 Mpc simulation exhibits a significant deficit in halo density (\u223c 20%), with\nits most massive halo being 8 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 , as opposed to\n2 \u00d7 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 in the larger simulation. Additionally, we\nfind an error of several percent in the halo correlation function measured at 10 h\u22121 Mpc in the 200 h\u22121 Mpc simulation\nas compared with the larger one, and it is significantly truncated on scales & 0.1 Lbox .\nTo test these finite-volume issues on subhalo clustering, we create a second subhalo catalog by mapping our\nhigh-resolution subhalo catalog onto the halo catalog of the\nlarger, less resolved simulation. Based on convergence tests\nfrom simulations of multiple sizes, the larger simulation accurately reproduces the spatial clustering on the scales of interest. We randomly match two halos of the same mass from\nthe two simulations, and we take subhalos from the halo in\nthe high-resolution simulation and paste them onto the halo\nin the larger simulation. We place the central subhalo at the\npotential minimum of the halo, and we place the satellite\nsubhalos using a random overall orientation such that their\npositions with respect to all other subhalos in the host halo\nare retained. Since halos of M > 8 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 do not\nhave a counterpart in the high-resolution simulation, we use\nfits to the satellite HOD extrapolated to higher halo mass\nto populate these halos in the larger simulation, assigning\nthe satellite radial distributions to follow their halo NFW\nprofiles with a random phase. To examine the influence of\ncosmology, we also populate our subhalo catalog into our\n500 h\u22121 Mpc simulation which uses n = 1.0 and \u03c38 = 0.9.\nFigure A1 shows the effects of both simulation size and\ncosmology on the correlation function of subhalos corresponding to Mr < \u221221.0. Subhalos in the larger simulation with the same cosmology exhibit somewhat enhanced\nwp (rp ) on the largest and smallest scales. The change on\nmoderate to small scales arises primarily because our repopulation method ignores any environmental effects on the\nsatellites, like halo alignment. However, the large scale clustering amplitude is little affected. We thus conclude that the\n200 h\u22121 Mpc simulation is not significantly affected by box\nsize on these scales.\nWe emphasize, however, that the spatial clustering in\nsmaller simulation box sizes is significantly affected on these\nscales. We have performed the same comparisons with observations as in Fig. A1 with a simulation of the same mass\nresolution and subhalo finder as the 200 h\u22121 Mpc simulac 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201319\n\nFigure A1. Same as Fig. 6, but using a fixed finf = 0.01 for\nsubhalos directly from the 200 h\u22121 Mpc simulation, and for subhalos populated into host halos in the 720 h\u22121 Mpc simulation\n(same cosmology) and 500 h\u22121 Mpc simulation (different cosmology). wp (rp ) (top) and ratio of simulations to observed wp (rp )\n(bottom). Also shown is the reduced \u03c72 of the fit to observation\nfor each simulation.\n\ntion, but was a smaller 125 h\u22121 Mpc box5 We find a noticeable deficit in wp (rp ) at all subhalo masses both on large\nand small scales as compared with observations and our\n200 h\u22121 Mpc box. The former is readily expected, driven\nby mean density and a truncation of large-scale power. The\nlatter effect is more subtle, arising from the truncation of\nthe halo mass function at high mass, which strongly affects\nthe overall satellite population since these halos host many\nsatellites. Thus, we stress that in comparing the spatial clustering of subhalos in simulations to observed galaxies, both\nresolution and finite volume effects need be considered.\nFigure A1 also shows that changing cosmology to n =\n1.0 and \u03c38 = 0.9 leads to a similar but stronger enhancement\nin wp (rp ) which is less consistent with observations. Thus, if\n\u03c38 is considerably larger than our fiducial value of 0.8, our\nbest-fit finf of 0.01 might be an underestimate.\n\nREFERENCES\nBaugh C.
