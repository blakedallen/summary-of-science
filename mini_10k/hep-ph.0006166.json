To understand final-state properties such as forward jet rates and\ntransverse energy flow, it is important to have event generators which give a\ngood description of the experimental data. It has, however, turned out to be\ndifficult to produce such an event generator.\nTo leading double-log accuracy, the CCFM [1] evolution should be the best\nway of describing small-x final states, and some attempts to implement CCFM\ninto an event generator has been made e.g. SMALLX [2] and LDCMC [3]. Below\nwe will discuss some recent developments of these generators as well as the\nnew CASCADE [4] generator for CCFM.\n2\n\nCCFM and the SMALLX and CASCADE programs\n\nThe implementation of the CCFM [1] parton evolution in the forward evolution\nMonte Carlo program SMALLX is described in detail in [2], and we have already\nreported on some recent developments in [4] and [5]. The main new ingredient\nis a modification in the treatment of the non-Sudakov form factor, \u2206ns , which\nallows for the removal of the so-called consistency constraint. Rather than\n2\n2\nusing the simple form, log \u2206ns = \u2212\u1fb1s log(1/zi ) log(kti\n/zi qti\n), which requires\na Talk\n\npresented at the DIS 2000 workshop, Liverpool, England, April 2000.\n\n1\n\n\fx 10 2\n\n450\n\n1400\n\nH1\n\n400\n\n1200\n\n350\n\n1000\n300\ndN/dz\n\nd\u03c3/dx\n\n500\n\n250\n200\n\n800\n\n600\n\n150\n\n400\n100\n50\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n200\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\n0\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\n0.004\n\nx\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nz\n\nFigure 1: (a) The cross section for forward jet production as a function of x, compared to\nH1 data [7]. (b) The values of z in the initial state cascade for events satisfying the selection\nof forward jet production. The solid (dashed) lines are the prediction of the Monte Carlo\nwithout (with) applying the \"consistency constraint\" (c.c.). (c) is the same as (a) but using\nthe LDCMC program including only gluonic ladders with (dotted line) and without (full line)\nthe non-singular terms in the gluon splitting function.\n\n2\n2\nthe consistency constraint kti\n> zi qti\nin order to be below unity, the full form [6]\nis used:\n\uf8f1\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nif kti /qti > 1\n\uf8f21\nkti\nz0\n, z0 = kti /qti if z < kti /qti \u2264 1 (1)\nlog\nlog \u2206ns = \u2212\u1fb1s log\n2\n\uf8f3\nzi\nz0 zi qti\nz\nif kti /qti \u2264 z\n\nThis form factor is well behaved for all emissions and gives no suppression in\nthe region kti /qti \u2264 z where then \u2206ns = 1.\nIn Fig. 1a the prediction for the forward jets is shown. The data are nicely\ndescribed. Including the consistency constraint, the x dependence of the total\ncross section changes, but a similarly good description of F2 is obtained by\nchanging the infrared cutoff, Q0 . However the forward jet cross section is\nreduced.\nThe effect of the consistency constraint is well illustrated in the spectrum\nof the values of the splitting variable z for events that satisfy the criteria\nof forward jet production (Fig. 1b). Only about half of the events satisfy\nthe consistency constraint, and especially medium and large values of z are\nrejected. Furthermore we notice that in general z is not very small thus showing\nthat even in forward jet production we are far away from the asymptotic region,\nwhere the small x approximation is valid.\nThe CASCADE program which implements CCFM evolution in a backward\nevolution algorithm, gives results which agree well with the ones from SMALLX.\nIt should also be noted that these programs also are able to reproduce other\ndata, such as F2c and photo-production of J/\u03a8 as measured at HERA.\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Linked Dipole Chain Model and the LDCMC program\n\nThe Linked Dipole Chain Model [8], LDC, is a reformulation of the CCFM\nevolution. The main idea is to reinterpret the non-Sudakov form factor as a\nnormal Sudakov for the no-emission probability in some phase-space region. By\nredefining the division between initial- and final-state splittings (which is done\nby angular ordering in CCFM), requiring the transverse momentum of a gluon\nemitted in the initial-state to be larger than the minimum transverse momenta\n2\n2\n2\nof the connecting propagators, qi\u22a5\n> min(ki\u22a5\n, ki\u22121\u22a5\n), an extra weight is given\nto each splitting corresponding to the sum of all emissions which in this way\nare treated as final-state. In the limit of emissions which are strongly ordered\nboth in longitudinal and transverse momenta of the propagating gluon, it can\nthen be shown that if the kinematical constraint is applied, this sum exactly\ncancels the non-Sudakov. It has, however, not been proven that this holds if\nthe consistency constraint is relaxed.\nLDCMC is able to give a good description of F2 , but underestimates the\nforward jet rates by approximately a factor 2. Much effort has lately been put\ninto the understanding of the differences between SMALLX and CASCADE on\none hand and LDCMC on the other. Some of this work was reported on in [5].\nOne difference between LDCMC and SMALLX is that the latter only includes the\nsingular parts of the gluon splitting function, i.e. the 1/z and the 1/(1 \u2212 z)\nterms, where the 1/z term is regularized by the non-Sudakov:\nP\u0303g (z) = \u2206ns\n\n1\n1\n+\n.\nz 1\u2212z\n\n(2)\n\nLDCMC,\n\nhowever, uses the full splitting function including the non-singular\nterms (where the non-Sudakov has been canceled):\nPg (z) =\n\n1\n1\n+\n\u2212 2 + z(1 \u2212 z).\nz\n1\u2212z\n\n(3)\n\nIn the limits of z close to zero or one, which is the limit in which the CCFM\nequation is derived, the non-singular terms should be negligible. But, as seen\nin fig. 1b, the typical z-values in events with forward jets are around 0.5 where\nthe non-singular terms may reduce the splitting function with almost a factor\n2. It is intriguing to note that the forward jet rates obtained by LDCMC is\napproximately a factor two below those obtained with SMALLX (which agrees\nwith data). Indeed, preliminary investigations show that removing the nonsingular terms from LDCMC does increase the forward jet rates as seen in fig. 1c\nalthough not with as much as a factor of two [9].\n3\n\n\f4\n\nOpen questions\n\nThe fact that the results from the SMALLX, CASCADE and LDCMC programs\ndepends strongly on the treatment of the consistency constraint and on the\nnon-singular terms in the gluon splitting functions, means that also the CCFM\nequation as such is sensitive to these non-leading effects for observables such\nas the forward jet rates.\nTo include the non-singular terms in the gluon splitting function in the\nCCFM equation is not completely straight forward. Simply adding them to\neq. 2 may result in negative splitting probabilities. But in the limits of z close\nto zero or one, it is allowed to let the non-Sudakov in eq. 2 multiply also the\n1/(1 \u2212 z) term: P\u0303g = \u2206ns Pgsing (z) = \u2206ns (1/z + 1/(1 \u2212 z)), in which case\nit is possible to replace the Pgsing (z) with the full splitting function of eq. 3.\nPreliminary investigations [9] show that doing this in the SMALLX program\nindeed gives a large effect, although more studies are needed to quantify the\ninfluence on the results for e.g. forward jet rates.\nIn conclusion, it is still an open question whether the CCFM evolution\nequation is an appropriate way of describing small-x final states or not. Much\nmore work is needed, both phenomenological work using the event generators\nand purely theoretical studies of the CCFM evolution, to understand how\nto correctly treat the non-leading effects which seem to be important in the\ndescription of data.\nReferences\n1.
