INTRODUCTION\n\nFor a long time, Standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (SBBN) was the only method to evaluate the baryonic density\nin the Universe, by comparing observed and calculated light-element abundances [1,2] (4 He, D, 3 He and 7 Li). However,\nthe study of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies has provided very recently a new tool for the precise\n[3] determination of the baryonic density, which can be compared to the results obtained from SBBN. The compatibility\nof these two studies would lead to a more convincing evaluation of this fundamental cosmological parameter. On the\nother hand, a significant difference would point either towards an underestimate of the errors, or towards the need of\nnew astrophysical models. Since the precision on the determination of the baryonic density from the CMB has been\ndrastically improved with the WMAP satellite [4], it is crucial to reduce the uncertainties on the thermonuclear rates,\nwhich represent the main input in Standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis.\nCompilations of thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysics, containing the main reactions of SBBN, have been\ninitiated by W. Fowler and his collaborators. The last version [5] of this compilation (hereafter referred to as CF88)\nconcerning isotopes up to silicon was published in 1988 but it is now partially superseded by the NACRE compilation\n[6]. One of the main innovative features of NACRE with respect to former compilations is that it provides realistic\nestimates of lower and upper bounds of the rates. Using these bounds, uncertainties on SBBN yields have been\ncalculated [7,8,2]. However, Refs. [5] and [6] are broad compilations not precisely aimed at SBBN. Compilations\nconcerning specifically SBBN reaction rates have been performed by Smith, Kawano, and Malaney [9] (hereafter\nSKM) and Nollett and Burles [10] (hereafter NB). They both address the main reactions of SBBN and calculate\nthe corresponding nuclear uncertainties. The SKM analysis was performed using polynomial expansions for the cross\nsections, and the uncertainties on the rates were in general only estimated by allowing the S-factor limits to encompass\nall existing data, a prescription also found in some reactions covered by NACRE. From the statistical point of view, the\nrate uncertainties are better defined in the NB compilation than in SKM or NACRE, but the astrophysical S-factors\nof NB are fitted by splines which have no physical justification. As the experimental cross sections for SBBN are in\ngeneral known with a fairly good accuracy, it is important not to introduce bias due to the theoretical fit of the data.\nA practical difficulty with the NB compilation is that the rates are not provided because, by construction, they cannot\nbe disentangled from the Monte-Carlo calculations. A recent work [8] also uses a subset of NACRE data limited to\nthe energy range of BBN (a questionable prescription) leading to slightly different reaction rates.\nThe calculation of the reaction rates is based on low-energy cross sections which, for charged particles, are extremely\nsmall due to the repulsive effect of the Coulomb barrier [11]. This makes measurements in laboratories very tedious\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nDirecteur de Recherches FNRS\nPermanent address: LPHEA, FSSM, Universit\u00e9 Caddi Ayyad, Marrakech, Morocco\n\n1\n\n\fand a complementary theoretical analysis is in general required. To compensate the fast energy dependence of the\ncross section, nuclear astrophysicists usually use the S-factor defined as\nS(E) = \u03c3(E) E exp(2\u03c0\u03b7),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E is the c.m. energy, and \u03b7 the Sommerfeld parameter [11]. The S-factor is mainly sensitive to the nuclear\ncontribution to the cross section. For non-resonant reactions, its energy dependence is rather smooth.\nRecent work has been focusing on primordial nucleosynthesis and on its sensitivity with respect to nuclear reaction\nrates [12,13,9,10,8]. In these papers, the nuclear reaction rates are either reconsidered by the authors themselves [9],\nor taken from specific works [8] such as the Caltech [5] or NACRE [6] compilations. The goals of the present work are\nmultiple. First, we analyze low-energy cross sections in the R-matrix framework [14] which provides a more rigorous\nenergy dependence, based on Coulomb functions. This approach is more complicated than those mentioned above,\nand could not be considered for broad compilations covering many reactions [5,6]. However, the smaller number of\nreactions involved in Big Bang nucleosynthesis makes the application of the R-matrix feasible. In addition, we do not\nrestrict the data sets to the energy range of BBN, taking advantage of all data to constrain the S-factor. A second\ngoal of our work is a careful evaluation of the uncertainties associated with the cross sections and reaction rates.\nThis is performed here by using standard statistical techniques [15] and will be presented in more detail in Section 2.\nFinally, since the completion of the NACRE compilation, several new data have come available (essentially data on\n3\nHe(n,p)3 H [16] and 2 H(p,\u03b3)3 He [17]) and should be included to update the reaction rates. The reactions covered by\nthe present analysis are:\n\u2022 2 H(p,\u03b3)3 He\n\u2022 2 H(d,n)3 He\n\u2022 2 H(d,p)3 H\n\u2022 3 H(d,n)4 He\n\u2022 3 H(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Li\n\u2022 3 He(n,p)3 H\n\u2022 3 He(d,p)4 He\n\u2022 3 He(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be\n\u2022 7 Li(p,\u03b1)\u03b1\n\u2022 7 Be(n,p)7 Li\nThe reaction rates and S-factors are available at http://pntpm3.ulb.ac.be/bigbang. We have not reconsidered the\np(n,\u03b3)2 H reaction rate, for which we adopt the analysis of Chen and Savage [18]. The present paper deals with the\ncalculation of the reaction rates only. In a separate work [19] we analyze the consequences of these new reaction rates\non the determination of the baryonic density of the Universe, and we will confront the results with the high precision\n(\u00b14%) value given by WMAP [4]. Indeed, in a previous work [2] we pointed out that the compatibility between the\nvalues obtained from CMB experiments and BBN calculations was only marginal. Thanks to the quality of the data\nprovided by WMAP observations, it is mandatory to reduce drastically the nuclear uncertainties which affect the\nBBN calculations.\nII. THE R-MATRIX METHOD\nA. General formalism\n\nOwing to the very low cross sections, one of the main problems in nuclear astrophysics is to extrapolate the available\ndata down to very low energies [11]. Several models, such as the potential model or microscopic approaches, are widely\nused for that purpose. However, they are in general not flexible enough to account for the data with a high accuracy.\nA simple way to extrapolate the data is to use a polynomial approximation as, for example, in Ref. [9]. This is usually\nused to investigate electron screening effects, where the cross section between bare nuclei is derived from a polynomial\nextrapolation of high-energy data. This polynomial approximation, although very simple, is not based on a rigorous\n2\n\n\ftreatment of the energy dependence of the cross section, and may introduce significant inaccuracies. As mentioned in\nthe introduction, we use here a more rigorous approach, based on the R-matrix technique. In this method, the energy\ndependence of the cross sections is obtained from Coulomb functions, as expected from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The\ngoal of the R-matrix method [14,20] is to parameterize some experimentally known quantities, such as cross sections\nor phase shifts, with a small number of parameters, which are then used to extrapolate the cross section down to\nastrophysical energies.\nThe R-matrix framework assumes that the space is divided into two regions: the internal region (with radius a),\nwhere nuclear forces are important, and the external region, where the interaction between the nuclei is governed by\nthe Coulomb force only. Although the R-matrix parameters do depend on the channel radius a, the sensitivity of the\ncross section with respect to its choice is quite weak. The physics of the internal region is parameterized by a number\nN of poles, which are characterized by energy E\u03bb and reduced width \u03b3\u0303\u03bb . In a multichannel problem, the R-matrix at\nenergy E is defined as\nRij (E) =\n\nN\nX\n\u03b3\u0303\u03bbi \u03b3\u0303\u03bbj\n,\nE\u03bb \u2212 E\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bb=1\n\nwhich must be given for each partial wave J. Indices i and j refer to the channels. For the sake of simplicity we do\nnot explicitly write indices J\u03c0 in the R matrix and in its parameters.\nDefinition (2) can be applied to resonant as well as to non-resonant partial waves. In the latter case, the nonresonant behavior is simulated by a high-energy pole, referred to as the background contribution, which makes the\nR-matrix almost energy independent. The pole properties (E\u03bb , \u03b3\u0303\u03bbi ) are known to be associated with the physical\nenergy and width of resonances, but not strictly equal. This is known as the difference between \"formal\" parameters\n(E\u03bb , \u03b3\u0303\u03bb,i ) and \"observed\" parameters (E\u03bbr , \u03b3\u03bb,i ), deduced from experiment. In a general case, involving more than one\npole, the link between those two sets is not straightforward; recent works [21,22] have established a general formulation\nto deal with this problem.\nB. Elastic scattering\n\nElastic scattering does not directly present an astrophysical interest, but is the basis for capture and transfer\nreactions. In single-channel calculations, the R matrix is a function which is given by\nR(E) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bb=1\n\n\u03b3\u0303\u03bb2\n,\nE\u03bb \u2212 E\n\n(3)\n\nand the phase shift is given by\n\u03b4 = \u03b4HS + \u03b4R = \u2212 arctan\n\nPR\nF (ka)\n+ arctan\n,\nG(ka)\n1 \u2212 SR\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have introduced the hard-sphere phase shift \u03b4HS and the R-matrix phase shift \u03b4R . In eq. (4), k is the\nwave number and F and G are the Coulomb functions (we do not explicitly write the angular momentum l); the\npenetration and shift factors P and S are given by\nL = ka\n\nO\u2032 (ka)\n= S + iP,\nO(ka)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the outgoing Coulomb function O is given by O = G + iF [14].\nThe link between formal and observed parameters is discussed, for example, in Refs. [14,21,22]. Here we just\nmention the main results. The resonance energy Eir , or the \"observed\" energy, is defined as the energy where the\nR-matrix phase shift is \u03b4R = \u03c0/2. According to (4), Eir is therefore a solution of the equation\nS(Eir )R(Eir ) = 1.\n\n(6)\n\nIf the pole number N is larger than unity, the link between observed and calculated parameters is not analytical\nand requires numerical calculations [21]. We illustrate here the simple but frequent situation for N = 1, where\nE1r = E1 \u2212 \u03b3\u030312 S(E1r ),\n\u0001\n\u03b312 = \u03b3\u030312 / 1 + \u03b3\u030312 S \u2032 (E1r ) ,\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fwith S \u2032 (E) = dS/dE. These formulas provide a simple link between calculated and observed values. In eq.(7), \u03b312 is\nthe observed reduced width, defined from the experimental width \u03931 by the well known relationship\n\u03931 = 2\u03b312 P (E1r ).\n\n(8)\n\nEquations (7) allow to determine the R matrix parameters from the experimental data.\n\nC. Transfer reactions\n\nLet us consider two colliding nuclei with masses (A1 , A2 ), charges (Z1 e, Z2 e) and spins (I1 , I2 ). The transfer cross\nsection \u03c3t (E) from the initial state to a final state is defined as\n\u03c3t (E) =\n\nX\nX\n2J + 1\n\u03c0\n(1 + \u03b412 )\n|U J\u03c0 \u2032 \u2032 (E)|2 ,\n2\nk\n(2I1 + 1)(2I2 + 1) \u2032 \u2032 lI,l I\nJ\u03c0\n\n(9)\n\nll II\n\nwhere \u03b412 is 1 or 0, for symmetric and non-symmetric systems, respectively. The collision matrix U J\u03c0 (E) contains\nthe information about the transfer process. Quantum numbers (lI) and (l\u2032 I \u2032 ) refer to the entrance and exit channels,\nrespectively. In general, for given total angular momentum J and parity \u03c0, several I values (arising from the coupling\nof I1 and I2 ) and l values are allowed. To simplify the presentation, we assume here that a single set of (lI) and (l\u2032 I \u2032 )\nvalues is involved in (9). This is justified at low energies where the lowest angular momentum is strongly dominant.\nAs shown in ref. [23], the collision matrix U is deduced from the R-matrix by\nU11 =\n\nI1 1 \u2212 R11 L\u22c61 \u2212 R22 L2\n,\nO1 1 \u2212 R11 L1 \u2212 R22 L2\n\nI2 1 \u2212 R11 L1 \u2212 R22 L\u22c62\n,\nO2 1 \u2212 R11 L1 \u2212 R22 L2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2ia k1 k2 R11 R22\n= U21 =\n,\nO1 O2 (1 \u2212 R11 L1 \u2212 R22 L2 )\n\n(10)\n\nU22 =\nU12\n\n(11)\n\nwhere we have introduced the incoming Coulomb functions I1 and I2 , defined by Ii = Oi\u22c6 . In these equations,\nthe Coulomb functions are evaluated at the channel radius a. When a single pole is present, eq. (7), defined for\nsingle-channel systems, is extended to\n2\n2\nE1r = E1 \u2212 \u03b3\u03031,1\nS1 (E1r ) \u2212 \u03b3\u03031,2\nS2 (E1r ),\n\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b31,i\n= \u03b3\u03031,i\n/ 1 + \u03b3\u03031,1\nS1\u2032 (E1r ) + \u03b3\u03031,2\nS2\u2032 (E1r ) .\n\n(12)\n\n0\nRij (E) = Rij\n,\n\n(13)\n\n0\n0\n0 2\n(R12\n) = R11\nR22\n\n(14)\n\nIf no resonance is present in the energy range of interest, the R-matrix (2) involves high-energy poles only. In that\ncase it can be parameterized by a constant value\n\nwith the constraint\n\nif a single pole is involved.\nD. Radiative-capture cross sections\n\nThe determination of capture cross sections requires the calculation of matrix elements of the multipole operators\nM\u03c3\u03bb . According to the R-matrix method, such a matrix element between two wave functions \u03a8i and \u03a8f is written as\n< \u03a8f ||M\u03c3\u03bb ||\u03a8i >=< \u03a8f ||M\u03c3\u03bb ||\u03a8i >int + < \u03a8f ||M\u03c3\u03bb ||\u03a8i >ext = Mint + Mext ,\n4\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere Mint and Mext represent the internal and external contributions, respectively. Wave function \u03a8f corresponds\nto the final (bound) state whereas \u03a8i describes the initial scattering state at energy E. In the internal region their\neffect is simulated by the pole properties [14]. At large distances, their asymptotic behaviors are given by\n\u03a8f \u2192 Cf W\u2212\u03b7f ,lf +1/2 (2kf \u03c1)\n\u03a8i \u2192 Ili (k\u03c1) \u2212 U li Oli (k\u03c1),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Cf and kf are the Asymptotic Normalization Constant (ANC) and the wave number of the final wave function,\nrespectively; W is the Whittaker function, and U li is the collision matrix of the initial state.\nThe capture cross section is then defined as\n\u03c3c =\n\nX\n2Ji + 1\n\u03c0\n(1\n+\n\u03b4\n)\n|U \u03b3 (Ji \u03c0i \u2192 Jf \u03c0f )|2 ,\n12\nk2\n(2I1 + 1)(2I2 + 1)\n\n(17)\n\nJi ,\u03c0i\n\nwhich extends the transfer cross section (9) to reactions involving photons [14].

This presentation is general. In the present\nwork, none of the capture reactions involves a resonance at low energy. Consequently, the internal contribution (19)\nis determined with a single pole at energy E0 , which simulates the background.\nIII. TREATMENT OF UNCERTAINTIES\n\nImprovements of the current work on Big Bang nucleosynthesis essentially concerns a more precise evaluation of\nuncertainties on the reaction rates. Here, we address this problem by using standard statistical methods [15]. This\nrepresents a significant improvement with respect to NACRE [6], where uncertainties are evaluated with a simple\nprescription, necessary for a simultaneous analysis of many reactions, but which does not correspond to a rigorous\nstatistical treatment. The NACRE error bars should not be interpreted as 1\u03c3 errors. The R-matrix approach depends\non a number of parameters, some of them being fitted, whereas others are constrained by well determined data, such\nas energies or widths of resonances. Let us denote by \u03bd the number of free parameters pi . The choice of the free\nparameters is guided by the physics of the problem. The reduced \u03c72 value is defined as\n5\n\n\f\u03c72 (pi ) =\n\n\u00132\nN \u0012 exp\n1 X \u03c3k \u2212 \u03c3kth (pi )\nN \u2212\u03bd\n\u2206\u03c3kexp\n\n(23)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere N is the number of experimental data, \u03c3kexp is the experimental cross section (with uncertainty \u2206\u03c3kexp ) and\n\u03c3kth (pi ) the R-matrix cross section at the corresponding energy. As usual, the adopted parameter set is obtained\nfrom the minimal \u03c72 value. Notice that this definition assumes that the data sets are independent of each other.\nA more general definition, involving the covariance matrix can be found in Ref. [15]. However, with the currently\navailable data, Eq. (23) should be used, which could slightly affect the quoted uncertainties. The uncertainties on\nthe parameters are evaluated as explained in Ref. [15]. The range of acceptable pi values is such that\n\u03c72 (pi ) \u2264 \u03c72 (pmin\n) + \u2206\u03c72 ,\ni\nwhere\n\npmin\ni\n\n(24)\n\n2\n\nis the optimal parameter set. In this equation, \u2206\u03c7 is obtained from\nP (\u03bd/2, \u2206\u03c72 /2) = 1 \u2212 p,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere P (a, x) is the Incomplete Gamma function, and p is the confidence limit (p = 0.683 for the 1\u03c3 confidence\nlevel). We refer to Refs. [15,24] for details. Equation (24) defines a region of R-matrix parameters acceptable for the\ncross-section fits. This range is scanned for all parameters, and the limits on the cross sections are then estimated at\neach energy.\nThe optimal parameters are complemented by the covariance matrix (Table II). The covariance matrix C between\nparameters pi and pj is defined [24] from\nCij = [\u03b1\u22121 ]ij\n1 \u2202 2 \u03c72\n\u03b1ij =\n,\n2 \u2202pi \u2202pj\nwhere the derivatives are calculated at the minimum. Uncertainties on parameters pi are determined from\np\n\u2206pi = Cii ,\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\nbut, in general the off-diagonal elements are large, and individual errors cannot be quoted without the covariance\nmatrix.\nIn many references, the statistical and systematic errors are not available separately. As we want to use an\nhomogeneous treatment, we have combined then in the fitting procedure, when available. An advantage of the physical\nenergy dependence provided by the R-matrix formalism is that it gives a further constraint on the fit. Consequently\nthe recommended uncertainties can be lower than the systematic uncertainty. This would not be true with polynomial\napproximations for example, where the resulting fits must be scaled by the systematic error.\nAs is well known, several reactions involved in nuclear astrophysics present different data sets which are not compatible with each other. An example is the 3 He(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be reaction where data with different normalizations are available.\nIn this case we have used a procedure adapted from the recommendations of Audi and Wapstra [25] and of the Particle\nData Group [15].\n(i) Case 1 : \u03c72 > 1\nIf no systematic difference exists between the normalizations, and if \u03c72 is significantly larger than 1, this means\nthat the error bars have been underevaluated in the original work. This would give recommended S factors with too\nlow uncertainties. According to refs [25,15], the errors bars of the data with the individual \u03c72k defined by\n\u0012 exp\n\u00132\n\u03c3k \u2212 \u03c3kth (pi )\n2\n\u03c7k =\n>1\n(28)\n\u2206\u03c3kexp\np\nhave been multiplied here by \u03c72k . In this way, the global \u03c72 value (23) is equal to 1, and the usual method can be\nused to evaluate the uncertainties on the S factor.\n(ii) Case 2 : different normalizations\nIn some reactions, the differences between data sets obviously arise from different normalizations. The standard\n\u03c72 method is meaningless in this case since: (i) the \u03c72 value is most likely larger than 1; (ii) the weight of data sets\nwith many data is overestimated, compared to data sets with less data. In those circumstances, we have performed\nindividual fits of each data set separately. The procedure is detailed below.\n6\n\n\f\u2022 Step 1\nEach data set is fitted individually (Fig. 1, panel (a)). Then extrapolation of all sets provides the cross sections\nat any energy (Fig. 1, panel (b)).\n\u2022 Step 2\nAt a given energy Ek , an averaged cross section is determined as\n\u03c3\n\nef f\n\n(Ek ) =\n\nPNexp\n\n2\ni=1 \u03c3i (Ek )/\u2206\u03c3i\n,\nPNexp\n2\ni=1 1/\u2206\u03c3i\n\n(29)\n\nwhere Nexp is the number of data sets and \u2206\u03c3i the error bar (for extrapolated data the error bar is taken as the\nlargest value). This step is shown in Fig. 1 (panel (c)). Along with Eq. (29) an effective error bar is determined\nas\nv\nuNexp\nuX\nef f\n(30)\n1/\u2206\u03c3i2\n\u2206\u03c3\n= 1/t\ni=1\n\n\u2022 Step 3\nAt energy Ek , a partial \u03c72 is determined, and the error bar (30) is renormalized if \u03c72 > 1. This method provides\na reasonable way to deal with data sets presenting different normalizations. It has been used for the 2 H(d,n)3 He\nand 2 H(d,p)3 H reactions.\n\n7\n\n\fS\nS\n\n(a)\n\nS\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nE\nFIG. 1. Illustration of case 2 (see text).

CALCULATION OF REACTION RATES\nA. Definition\n\nThe reaction rate NA h\u03c3vi is defined as [26]\nNA h\u03c3vi = NA\n\n(8/\u03c0)1/2\n\u03bc1/2 (kB T )3/2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c3E exp(\u2212E/kB T ) dE,\n\n(31)\n\n0\n\nwhere NA is the Avogadro number, \u03bc the reduced mass of the system, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature,\n\u03c3 the cross section, v the relative velocity, and E the energy in the centre-of-mass system. When NA h\u03c3vi is expressed\nin cm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 , the energies E and kB T in MeV, and the cross section \u03c3 in barn, Eq. (31) leads to\nZ \u221e\n10 \u22121/2 \u22123/2\nNA h\u03c3vi = 3.7313 \u00d7 10 \u03bc0\nT9\n\u03c3 E exp(\u221211.604E/T9) dE,\n(32)\n0\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the reduced mass in amu, and T9 is the temperature in units of 109 K. The calculation of the rates is\nperformed here between T9 = 0.001 and 10, and is compared with previous compilations [5,6].\n8\n\n\fLet us first discuss charged-particle reactions. Except near narrow resonances, the S-factor is a smooth function\nof energy, which is convenient for extrapolating measured cross sections down to astrophysical energies. When S(E)\nis assumed to be a constant, the integrand in Eq. (31) is peaked at the \"most effective energy\" (the Gamow energy\n[26]),\n\u0010 \u03bc \u00111/3 \u0012 \u03c0e2 Z Z k T \u00132/3\n1 2 B\n2/3\nE0 =\n= 0.1220 (Z12 Z22 \u03bc0 )1/3 T9 MeV\n(33)\n2\nh\u0304\nand can be approximated by a Gaussian function centered at E0 , with full width at 1/e of the maximum given by\n5/6\n\n\u2206E0 = 4 (E0 kB T /3)1/2 = 0.2368 (Z12Z22 \u03bc0 )1/6 T9\n\nMeV.\n\n(34)\n\nWith these approximations, the integral in Eq. (31) can be calculated analytically [26]. However, in the present\ncompilation we do not rely on such approximations and perform numerically the integration of Eq. (31). A good\naccuracy is reached by limiting the numerical integration for a given temperature to the energy domain (E0 \u2212\nn\u2206E0 , E0 + n\u2206E0 ), with typically n = 2 or 3. The accuracy is such that at least 4 digits on the rate are significant.\nFor neutron-induced reactions, Eq. (31) is integrated numerically from E = 0 to E = nkB T , where n is typically 10.\nTable V presents the rate in a numerical format. To interpolate we recommend to following procedure. As is it well\nknown [5], the non-resonant reaction rate can be parametrized as\nNA h\u03c3vi = exp(\u2212C0 /T 1/3 )f0 (T )/T 2/3 ,\nwhere C0 only depends on masses and charges of the system, and is defined by\n\u0014 2\n\u00152\ne\n\u03bcc2 1/2 3\nC0 = 3 \u03c0 Z1 Z2 (\n)\n,\nh\u0304c\n2kB\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nand where f0 (T ) is a smooth function of T . Interpolating f0 (T ) or log f0 (T ) with a spline method provides the rates\nwith a good accuracy (typically better than 0.1%).\nB. Screening effects\n\nIn stellar plasmas, atoms are usually completely ionized, and nuclear reactions involve bare nuclei. The situation\nis different in laboratories since target nuclei are partially- or un-ionized. Consequently the role of the electron cloud\ncannot be neglected at low energies. Let us notice that screening effects, with a different origin, may also occur in\nstars, but this issue is far beyond our topic.\nThe screening effect is usually evaluated through the screening potential Ue . The screening factor [27] is defined as\nf (E) =\n\n\u03c3exp (E)\n\u03c3th (E + Ue )\nUe\n=\n\u2248 exp(\u03c0\u03b7 ),\n\u03c3th (E)\n\u03c3th (E)\nE\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03c3exp (E) is the experimental cross section, affected by screening effects, and \u03c3th (E) the theoretical cross section\ninvolving bare nuclei. Here the R-matrix fit has been applied at energies unaffected by screening effects, and a screening\npotential has been deduced. For an extended R-matrix analysis of electron-screening effects, see for example ref. [28].\nC. Physical constants\n\nIn the analysis of the cross sections and in the calculation of the reaction rates, we have used the atomic masses as\nrecommended by Audi et al. [29]. The following values of the physical constants are used:\nc = 299792458 m s\u22121\n1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c2\n1 eV = 1.60218 \u00d7 10\u221219 J\nkB T = 0.08617 T9 = T9 /11.605 MeV\nNA = 6.0221 \u00d7 1023 mol\u22121\n\u03b1 = e2 /h\u0304c = 1/137.036\nh\u0304c = 197.327 MeV.fm\n\n9\n\n\fV. CROSS SECTIONS AND REACTION RATES\n2\n\nH(p,\u03b3)3 He\nThe data of ref. [30] are superseded by ref. [31] and are therefore not included. Very recent data [17] allow a more\nprecise extrapolation down to low energies. Below 0.01 MeV, the S factor is nearly constant which is typical of\ns-wave capture, proceeding by an M1 transition. At zero energy, our partial S factors 0.089 \u00b1 0.004 eV.b (E1) and\n0.134 \u00b1 0.006 eV.b (M1) are consistent with the values recommended by Schmid et al. [31] (0.073 eV.b and 0.109\neV.b, respectively) from polarized-data measurements. Our results are slightly higher than NACRE, which uses a\npolynomial fit for the S factor.\n2\n\nH(d,n)3 He and 2 H(d,p)3 H\nTwo non-resonant partial waves are included in the fit. The fits have been performed individually (data of refs.\n[32\u201334]), with each of them being complemented by the high-energy data of ref. [35]. The recommended S factors\nhave been deduced as explained in Sec. III. The individual fits are given in figs I.b and I.c as dotted lines. As shown\nin Ref. [23] it is not possible to optimize the fits of both reactions with the same parameter set. Consequently the\nR-matrix parameters are somewhat different. The reaction rates are close to the results of NACRE, but the uncertainties have been reduced.\n3\n\nH(d,n)4 He\nIn addition to the well known low-energy 3/2+ resonance (li = 0), non-resonant contributions from the 1/2+ (li = 0)\nand 1/2\u2212, 3/2\u2212 (li = 1) partial waves have been included. The present R-matrix fit is very close to the fit of Hale\n[36], and yields a fairly low uncertainty on the reaction rate. We find a reaction rate similar to NACRE, except at\nhigh temperatures, where NACRE uses very conservative lower and upper bounds.\n3\n\nH(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Li\nThe data of refs. [37,38] have not been included as they are obviously inconsistent with the other data sets. The s\u2212\nand d-wave contributions are taken into account. To reduce the number of free parameters, we have adopted, for\n3\nH(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Li and 3 He(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be, the same ANC values for the ground and first excited states. This seems reasonable as\nboth states arise from the same isospin doublet. The statistical method adopted here provides error bars significantly\nlower than in NACRE, where a very conservative technique was used. At high energies, the reaction rates are slightly\ndifferent; in spite of the lack of data above 1.2 MeV, the R-matrix approach is expected to be more reliable than the\npolynomial extrapolation used in NACRE.\n3\n\nHe(n,p)3 H\nIn the low-energy region, the main partial waves correspond to l = 0 and 1. According to the 4 He energy spectrum,\n\u2212\nthe 0+\n(Ex = 21.01 MeV) and 2\u2212 (Ex = 21.84 and 23.33 MeV) states are expected to\n2 (Ex = 20.21 MeV), 0\ndetermine the cross section. They correspond to (lI) = (0, 0), (1, 1) and (1,1), respectively. The role of the two broad\n2\u2212 resonances has been simulated by a single pole in the R-matrix expansion. An l = 0 non-resonant partial wave,\ncorresponding to J = 1+ has been also taken into account. The data of Brune et al. [16] suggest a new 0\u2212 resonance\nat 0.43 MeV which indeed must be included to optimize the fit. More detail can be found in Ref. [39].\n3\n\nHe(d,p)4 He\nThe dominance of the l = 0 contribution at low energy is confirmed by the isotropic angular distributions [40], but\na li = 1 component has been included to improve the quality of the fit. The Coulomb dependence involved in the\nR matrix approach leads to differences up to 10% with the polynomial expansion used by Krauss et al. [40]. This\nexplains the differences with previous compilations [5,6]. Our rate is in good agreement with the fit of Hale [36].\nThe low-energy data of Refs. [41] and [42] are affected by electron-screening effects. The former are obtained through\nthe d(3 He,p)4 He reaction, and are complemented by a subset of the latter data [42]. The screening potentials are found\nas Ue = 146 \u00b1 5 eV for the d(3 He,p)4 He reaction, and Ue = 201 \u00b1 10 eV for the 3 He(d,p)4 He reaction. These values\nare somewhat different from those derived in ref. [42] (109 \u00b1 9 eV and 219 \u00b1 7 eV) where a polynomial approximation\nis used to determine the bare-nucleus cross sections. According to ref. [42], we do not include the data of refs. [43,44]\nas their analysis was biased by stopping-power problems.\n3\n\nHe(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be\nA purely external capture has been assumed, with li = 0 and lf = 2 contributions. The data of ref. [45] are clearly\naffected by normalization problems, and have not been taken into account. According to Ref. [46], the data of\nKr\u00e4winkel et al. [47] have been renormalized by 1.4. For this reaction, most data sets allow an extrapolation down\n\n10\n\n\fto zero energy. Accordingly, an S(0) value, with the associated uncertainty, has been determined for each reaction,\nand an averaged S(0) has been obtained. Since the capture cross section is assumed to be external, the S factor only\ndepends on the normalization factor. The normalization has been deduced from the adopted S(0). The present S(0)\nvalue (S(0) = 0.51 \u00b1 0.04 keV.b) overlaps with the value recommended by Adelberger et al. [48] (S(0) = 0.53 \u00b1 0.05\nkeV.b) and by NACRE [6] (S(0) = 0.54 \u00b1 0.09 keV.b).\n7\n\nLi(p,\u03b1)\u03b1\nThe S factor is mainly determined by li = 1, J = 0+ , 2+ contributions. Owing to parity conservation and to the\nsymmetry of the final state, l = 0 partial waves in the entrance channel are forbidden. The 8 Be spectrum presents two\n2+ states below the 7 Li+p threshold. These states have been accounted for by a single state at E = \u22120.48 MeV. For\nthe 2+ resonance at E = 2.60 MeV, we neglect the interference with the subthreshold state; the energy and widths\nhave been taken from literature, without any fitting procedure.\nAt very low energies, data affected by electron screening (E < 40 keV) have not been considered in the fitting procedure. An analysis of the screening potential provides Ue = 100 \u00b1 25 eV. This value is much lower than the value\ndeduced by Engstler et al. (Ue = 300 \u00b1 280 eV for an atomic target, Ue = 300 \u00b1 160 eV for a molecular target) who\nuse a third-order polynomial to determine the bare-nucleus cross section. This procedure is quite questionable here\nsince the low-energy S-factor depends on a subthreshold state whose effect is negligible beyond 100 keV. A recent\nexperiment by Lattuada et al. [49] uses the Trojan Horse Method which does not depend on electron screening, and\nprovides S(0) = 55 \u00b1 3 keV.b by a polynomial extrapolation. The present analysis provides a significantly higher S\nfactor at low energy (S(0) = 67 \u00b1 4 keV.b). This discrepancy is confirmed by a recent R-matrix analysis of Barker\n[50,28] who finds values similar to ours.\n7\n\nBe(n,p)7 Li\nThe 2\u2212 state located very near threshold determines the cross section in a wide energy range. To reproduce the data\nup to 5 MeV we have included the 3+ resonances at E = 0.34 MeV and E = 2.60 MeV. We neglect interference\neffects. Our reaction rate is consistent with the SKM compilation up to T9 \u2248 4, but provides larger values above this\ntemperature. More detail can be found in Ref. [39].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Jeff Schweitzer for useful comments on the manuscript, and to Carl Brune for providing us with\nthe 3 He(n,p)3 H data in a numerical format. A.A. thanks the FNRS for financial support. This text presents research\nresults of the Belgian program P5/07 on interuniversity attraction poles initiated by the Belgian-state Federal Services\nfor Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs.\n\n11\n\n\fVI.
