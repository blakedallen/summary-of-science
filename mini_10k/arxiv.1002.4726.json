Small angle XRR measurements show smooth and well defined interfaces between\nthe LCO film and the single-crystalline substrates. Atomic\nforce microscopy measurements also indicate a smooth\nsurface morphology with a roughness (rms) ranging from\n0.5 to 1 nm. We note that LCO/STO films thicker than\n100 nm tend to crack, most likely caused by structural relaxation and thus the relief of tensile strain.

The role of light hole doping due to oxygen vacancies on the ferromagnetism in LaCoO3 films can't be totally ruled out. However, our previous investigations [6] of\nLCO films deposited on piezoelectric substrate under ten-\n\n4 Summary\n\nsile strain clearly show that the magnetization decreases\nwith the reversible release of tensile strain below Tc . Using this approach, e.g. reversible control of the strain by\nthe inverse piezoelectric effect of the substrate, one can\novercome the effect of other parameters, e.g. oxygen nonstoichiometry.

Single-phase (001) oriented LaCoO3 layers were\ngrown on all substrates despite large misfits, with tetragonal distortion varying from \u22122% to 2.8%. All LaCoO3\nfilms are ferromagnetic at low temperatures, contrary to\nthe bulk. The Curie temperature shows little variation\nwith different strain states. We observed an increase of\nCo saturation magnetic moment with increasing tetragonal distortion. This result confirms that tetragonal distortion plays an important role in the occurrence of ferromagnetism in LaCoO3 thin films.\n\n\f8\n\nA. D.
