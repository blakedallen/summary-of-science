Radio emission models of colliding wind binaries (CWBs) have been discussed by Dougherty et al.\n(2003). We extend these models by considering the temporal and spatial evolution of the energy distribution of\nrelativistic electrons as they advect downstream from their shock acceleration site. The energy spectrum evolves\nsignificantly due to the strength of inverse-Compton (IC) cooling in these systems, and a full numerical evaluation\nof the synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients is made. We have demonstrated that the geometry of the\nWCR and the streamlines of the flow within it lead to a spatially dependent break frequency in the synchrotron\nemission. We therefore do not observe a single, sharp break in the synchrotron spectrum integrated over the WCR,\nbut rather a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum towards higher frequencies. We also observe that emission\nfrom the wind-collision region (WCR) may appear brightest near the shocks, since the impact of IC cooling on\nthe non-thermal electron distribution is greatest near the contact discontinuity (CD), and demonstrate that the\nimpact of IC cooling on the observed radio emission increases significantly with decreasing binary separation. We\nstudy how the synchrotron emission changes in response to departures from equipartition, and investigate how\nthe thermal flux from the WCR varies with binary separation. Since the emission from the WCR is optically thin,\nwe see a substantial fraction of this emission at certain viewing angles, and we show that the thermal emission\nfrom a CWB can mimic a thermal plus non-thermal composite spectrum if the thermal emission from the WCR\nbecomes comparable to that from the unshocked winds. We demonstrate that the observed synchrotron emission\ndepends upon the viewing angle and the wind-momentum ratio, and find that the observed synchrotron emission\ndecreases as the viewing angle moves through the WCR from the WR shock to the O shock. We obtain a number\nof insights relevant to models of closer systems such as WR 140. Finally, we apply our new models to the very wide\nsystem WR 147. The acceleration of non-thermal electrons appears to be very efficient in our models of WR 147,\nand we suggest that the shock structure may be modified by feedback from the accelerated particles.\nKey words. stars:binaries:general \u2013 stars:early-type \u2013 stars:individual:WR 147 \u2013 stars:Wolf-Rayet \u2013 stars: winds,\noutflows \u2013 radio continuum:stars\n\n1. Introduction\nRadio observations of early-type stars reveal that they\ncan be sources of both thermal and non-thermal radiation. The thermal emission is readily explained as freefree emission within the stellar wind (Wright & Barlow\n1975), while the non-thermal emission is attributed to relativistic electrons moving in a magnetic field. The consensus is that the relativistic electrons in the winds of massive stars are created through diffusive shock acceleration\n(DSA), though other mechanisms have been investigated\nSend offprint requests to: J.M. Pittard,\ne-mail: jmp@ast.leeds.ac.uk\n\n(e.g., Jardine et al. 1996). Observations of the WR+OB\nbinary systems WR 140 (Dougherty et al. 2005), WR 146\n(Dougherty et al. 1996, 2000) and WR 147 (Moran et al.\n1989; Churchwell et al. 1992; Williams et al. 1997; Niemela\net al. 1998) clearly show the non-thermal emission in\nthese binaries arises from a wind-collision region (WCR)\nbounded by strong shocks formed where the two stellar\nwinds collide. There is strong evidence that all WR stars\nthat exhibit non-thermal emission are binary (Dougherty\n& Williams 2000).\nFor synchrotron emission to be observed, the relativistic electrons must be within the optically thin region of the\nstellar wind(s), which in the case of massive stars implies\n\n\f2\n\nJ.M. Pittard et al.: Radio emission models of Colliding-Wind Binary Systems\n\nat more than a few hundred stellar radii from the underlying star. These large radii are problematic for single star\nmodels of synchrotron emission, where the declining velocity jump and compression ratio with increasing radius\nof wind-embedded shocks produces a rapidly decreasing\nsynchrotron emissivity (Van Loo 2005).\nCWB systems are important objects for investigating\nthe underlying physics of DSA because they provide access to higher mass, radiation and magnetic field energy\ndensities than is possible through studies of supernova\nremnants. However, until the work of Dougherty et al.\n(2003) (hereafter Paper I), CWB models of radio spectra\nwere typically based on a highly simplified model consisting of a thermal source plus a point-like source of nonthermal emission attenuated by free-free absorption (e.g.,\nChapman et al. 1999; Monnier et al. 2002). Use of these\nmodels often resulted in difficulties in fitting observational\ndata (see, e.g., Williams et al. 1990; White & Becker 1995).\nAs a first step toward the construction of more realistic\nmodels with better predictive qualities, a hydrodynamical model of the WCR was used in Paper I to obtain a\nmore accurate representation of the spatial distribution\nof the free-free and non-thermal emission from CWB systems. Several important scaling laws were determined and,\nin spite of other simplifying assumptions, the results of\nthat work showed great promise in comparisons with observed continuum spectra and images. We refer the reader\nto Paper I for essential background to the work presented\nhere.\nInverse-Compton (hereafter IC) cooling is an important energy-loss mechanism for relativistic electrons in\nCWB systems, since the energy distribution will evolve as\nthe electrons advect away from the shocks. The inclusion\nof this process and the calculation of emission and absorption coefficients from an arbitrary energy distribution of\nnon-thermal electrons are the main enhancements to the\nmodel and the work presented in this paper. Following\nexamination of the effect of these mechanisms, we apply\nthese new models to WR 147, and close by describing future directions for this work.\n\n2. Modelling the radio emission from CWBs\nIn Paper I, the radio emission and absorption from a\nCWB system was calculated from a 2D axis-symmetric\nhydrodynamical model of the stellar winds and the collision zone. The temperature and density values on the\nhydrodynamic grid were used to calculate the free-free\nemission and absorption coefficients from each grid cell.\nThe synchrotron emission and self-absorption from each\ncell within the WCR was calculated assuming that the\ndistribution of relativistic electrons in each cell could be\nspecified by a power-law, i.e. ne (\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212p , where \u03b3 is the\nLorentz factor1 . The synchrotron emissivity, P\u03bd , also followed a power-law (P\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212(p\u22121)/2 ), which was assumed\n1\n\nFor a strong shock with a compression ratio of 4, test particle theory predicts that p = 2 (see references in Paper I).\n\nto be valid over all frequency, \u03bd. The flux and intensity\ndistribution at a specified frequency were then obtained\nfrom a radiative transfer calculation.\nThe hydrodynamical simulations of Paper I do not provide direct information on the magnetic field or relativistic\nparticle distribution, so the magnetic energy density UB ,\nand the relativistic electron energy density Urel , were set\nproportional to the thermal particle internal energy density, Uth :\nUB = B 2 /8\u03c0 = \u03b6B Uth ,\n\n(1)\n\nand\nUrel =\n\nZ\n\nne (\u03b3)\u03b3me c2 d\u03b3 = \u03b6rel Uth .\n\n(2)\n\nP\nUth = \u0393\u22121\n, with P the gas pressure and \u0393 the adiabatic\nindex, assumed to be 5/3, as for an ideal gas. \u03b6B and\n\u03b6rel are constants which determine the amount of synchrotron emission and absorption, and the Razin turnover\nfrequency in our models. Since we did not attempt to\nmodel the acceleration of the relativistic particles from basic principles, the values of \u03b6B and \u03b6rel are not determined\nin a self-consistent fashion. Instead, when modelling specific systems, their values are chosen to best match the\nobserved radio emission. Our previous models in Paper I\nshowed that if \u03b6B = \u03b6rel , then values of around 1% are required (see also Mioduszewski et al. 2001). Unless otherwise noted, \u03b6B = \u03b6rel = \u03b6, though we relax this restriction\nin Sec. 3.6 and in some models in Sec. 4.\n\n2.1. The hydrodynamical code\nIn contrast to Paper I, a hydrodynamical code with adaptive mesh refinement is used here (Falle & Komissarov\n1996; Falle et al. 1998). Such codes concentrate more cells\nwhere the flow is interesting, for example near shocks, and\nfewer cells where it is uniform, resulting in significantly\nshorter computational times. We use a small amount of\nartificial viscosity in the calculations to prevent the development of the carbuncle instability at the apex of the\nWCR. This numerical artifact develops when shocks are\nlocally aligned with the grid (Walder 1994; Leveque 1998).\n\n2.2. The non-thermal electron energy spectrum\nIn this work, it is assumed that the acceleration of relativistic electrons at the shocks bounding the WCR produces an energy distribution with a power-law spectrum.\nWhen particle acceleration is relatively inefficient, this is\nonly strictly true in the absence of cooling. However, the\nresulting deviation from a pure power-law is restricted to\nenergies which are very near to the high energy cutoff\n(Chen & White 1991; Van Loo et al. 2005), and we ignore this effect in the current work. In contrast, when\nDSA is efficient, non-linear effects modify the pre-shock\nwind speeds over a length scale comparable to the diffusion length of the energetic particles, and slow them before\n\n\fJ.M. Pittard et al.: Radio emission models of Colliding-Wind Binary Systems\n\n3\n\nthey undergo a shock transition. Thus higher energy particles with larger diffusion length scatter in regions where\nthe pre-shock wind speed is closer to the terminal speed of\nthe stellar wind, while low energy particles do not diffuse\nvery far from the subshock and scatter in regions where\nthe wind speed is lower due to its journey through much of\nthe shock precursor. This speed profile results in a concave\nupward curvature to the non-thermal particle spectrum,\nwhere p decreases with increasing energy (Ellison et al.\n2004, and references therein). Efficient particle acceleration can also flatten the non-thermal particle energy distribution i.e. p < 2. Modelling this process is non-trivial\nand we make no attempt in the current work to calculate\nthese effects self-consistently. However, we discuss it further and perform calculations with a non-thermal particle\nspectrum where p < 2 in Sec. 4.\nRelativistic electrons that scatter out of the shock with\n5\nLorentz factor \u03b3 <\n\u223c 10 are frozen into the post-shock\nflow (White 1985). As they are advected out of the system, the relativistic electrons lose energy through the action of several processes, including ionic cooling, magnetobremsstrahlung cooling, and IC cooling. Since IC cooling strongly dominates magneto-bremsstrahlung cooling\nin this work (see Eq. 14 of Paper I), we do not consider\nthe latter here. Cooling reduces the non-thermal electron\nenergy density at a given \u03b3 and alters the energy spectrum of these electrons from a simple power-law. Thus,\nin this work we assume the non-thermal electron energy\nspectrum is a power-law at the shocks, but let it evolve\nas the electrons advect downstream from the shocks. As\nnoted earlier, the inclusion of these processes is the main\nenhancement to the model since Paper I, and in the following sub-sections we describe in detail our method of\nimplementation.\n\nFor a given electron, the reduction in \u03b3 due to IC cooling\ncan be calculated if the integral of f t along its streamline\nis known. In a CWB, f = Lr2O + Lr2WR due to the radiation\nO\nWR\nfield of both stars. The value of f t in any given cell on\nthe hydrodynamic grid can be obtained by the specification of a suitable scalar in the code. It is then a simple\nmatter during post-processing to calculate the IC-cooled\nrelativistic energy spectrum at that location.\nThe influence of IC cooling increases in magnitude as\nplasma flows from the shocks toward the contact discontinuity - this reflects the increased exposure to the high\nintensity stellar radiation field from the time when the\nrelativistic electrons were accelerated in one of the shocks\nbounding the WCR. In addition, since the rate of cooling\nis proportional to \u03b3 2 , IC cooling is most significant for\nelectrons with the highest energies. We can therefore define a characteristic Lorentz factor, \u03b3c , where IC cooling\nbecomes significant for flow near the apex of the WCR.\nThe flow morphology and the distribution of electrons\nwith a specific Lorentz factor is shown in Fig. 1. For lowenergy electrons (\u03b3 << \u03b3c ), IC cooling is negligible and\nsuch electrons may exist throughout the WCR, as shown\nin Fig. 1b. In contrast, IC cooling is significant for electrons with \u03b3 >\n\u223c \u03b3c , which rapidly lose energy as they flow\naway from the shocks. In such circumstances, electrons\nwith \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3c are effectively confined to narrow regions\nnear the shocks, and absent from the central volume of\nthe WCR, as illustrated in Fig. 1c.\n\n2.2.1. Inverse Compton cooling\n\nd\u03b3\ndt\n\nThe high UV luminosity of the stars in CWBs means that\nIC cooling of the relativistic electrons in the WCR can\nbe very efficient, particularly for high \u03b3 electrons. In the\nThomson limit, the rate of energy loss of a relativistic\nelectron exposed to an isotropic distribution of photons\nby IC scattering is (Rybicki & Lightman 1979)\nPcompt =\n\n4\n\u03c3T c\u03b3 2 \u03b2 2 Uph ,\n3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\u03c3T is the Thomson cross section, \u03b2 = v/c =\np\n1 \u2212 1/\u03b3 2 , Uph is the energy density of photons, and\nwhere elastic scattering is assumed and quantum effects\non the cross section are neglected. For a single star and\nrelativistic particles with \u03b2 \u2248 1, we can rewrite Eq. 3 as\nd\u03b3\ndt\n\nic\n\n\u03c3T \u03b3 2 L\n= 8.61 \u00d7 10\u221220 \u03b3 2 f s\u22121 ,\n=\n3\u03c0me c2 r2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere L is the stellar luminosity, r is the distance of the\nparticles from the star, and f = rL2 ( erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ) is a\nmeasure of the radiative flux on an electron at distance r.\n\n2.2.2. Ionic (coulomb) cooling\nRelativistic electrons may also lose energy through\nCoulomb collisions with thermal ions. The rate of energy\nloss through this process for electrons of energy \u03b3 is (cf.\nChen & White 1991)\n=\ncoul\n\nni ln \u039b \u22121\n4\u03c0e4 ni ln \u039b\np\n= 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221214 p\ns , (5)\nm2e c3 \u03b3 2 \u2212 1\n\u03b32 \u2212 1\n\u22121/2\n\nT6 is the Coulomb logawhere ln \u039b = 29.7 + ln ni\nrithm (e.g., Cowie & McKee 1977)2 , T6 is the temperature\nin units of 106 K, and ni is the number density of ions\n( cm\u22123 ). As for IC cooling, we can estimate the degree of\nionic cooling, namely by constructing a scalar to track the\nvalue of ni t ln \u039b in each hydrodynamic cell of hot shocked\ngas. Ionic coooling is greatest for non-thermal electrons\nwith relatively low energies, and while it is included in our\nmodel we note that there is no observational signature of\nthis process on the synchrotron spectrum above 10 MHz\n(see Fig 3). However, we include it for completeness.\n\n2.2.3.

IC cooling effectively excludes electrons with Lorentz factor \u03b3c from a\nregion near the CD.\n\npre-existing or generated by the counter-streaming ions\nthemselves (Bell 1978). There is strong evidence that the\nefficiency of particle acceleration in the DSA scheme is\ndependent on the orientation of the upstream magnetic\nfield to the shock normal (see the review by Blandford &\nEichler 1987). When the shock is quasi-perpendicular the\ncompeting \"shock drift\" mechanism may be more efficient\n(Jokipii 1987), though the acceleration rates become equal\nin shocks with a high level of magnetic turbulence since\nthese have no well-defined obliquity3 .\nSince the physics of electron injection is not yet fully\nunderstood, we ignore these complications in the present\nwork, and assume that both the normalization of the nonthermal particle spectrum, and the maximum energy that\nthe accelerated particles can reach, are independent of spatial position. To estimate the value of \u03b3max , we balance the\nrate of energy gain through 1st-order Fermi acceleration,\nby the rate of energy loss due to IC cooling (the dominant\ncooling mechanism for relativistic electrons with large \u03b3).\nThe 1st-order Fermi power is (Chen & White 1991; Van\nLoo et al. 2005)4\nd\u03b3\ndt\n\n=\nacc\n\n4 \u03c7c \u2212 1 u\u03b3\u03b2 2 2u\n,\n3 \u03c7c\n\u03bb c\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c7c is the ratio of upstream to downstream flow\nspeeds, u is the shock velocity, c is the speed of light,\nand \u03bb is the mean-free path of the accelerating charge.\nThis latter quantity is somewhat uncertain, but is typically estimated as several gyro-radii. We adopt \u03bb \u2248 3rg ,\nwhere the gyro-radius rg = pc/qB (White 1985)5 , and p\n3\nThe obliquity of the shocks expected in CWB systems is\ndescribed by Eichler & Usov (1993).\n4\nChen & White (1991) erroneously assume that shockaccelerated electrons return to the shock after one scattering,\nwhereas electrons are actually scattered c/2u times before recrossing the shock (Van Loo et al. 2005).\n5\nThis is equivalent to specifying that the diffusion coefficient\nis proportional to the particle energy.\n\nand q are the momentum and charge of the accelerating\nparticle. Assuming that we are in the strong limit for adiabatic shocks (\u03c7c = 4) and that the accelerated charge is\na highly relativistic electron (\u03b2 = 1, \u03b3 >> 1), we have\nd\u03b3\ndt\n\n=\nacc\n\n1 uqB 2u\n.\n3 me c2 c\n\nBy balancing Eq. 4 with Eq. 7 we obtain\nr\nB\n.\n\u03b3max \u2248 400urO\nLO\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nEq. 8 is equivalent to Eq. 14 in Eichler & Usov (1993).\n1/4\nDue to its dependence on B, \u03b3max \u221d \u03b6B .

However,\nsince the value of \u03b6 required to match observational data\nis not known a priori, in all of the work presented in this\npaper we fix \u03b3max = 105 , which is also consistent with the\nmaximum \u03b3 at which relativistic electrons are frozen into\nthe post-shock flow.\n\n2.3. NT emission and absorption\nWith a power-law energy distribution, the magnetobremsstrahlung emission can be calculated analytically,\nas in Paper I. However, given an arbitrary energy distribution of non-thermal electrons, calculation of the\nmagneto-bremsstrahlung emission from the downstream\nflow requires a numerical integration of the magnetobremsstrahlung emissivity over the full energy range of\nthe relativistic electron energy spectrum.\n\n2.3.1.

Values for\nF (\u03bd/\u03bdc ) are tabulated in Ginzburg & Syrovatskii (1965).\nThroughout the remainder of this paper we assume that\nsin \u03b1 = 1. While this means that our calculations will\nslightly overestimate the synchrotron emission for a given\n\u03b6B , a more detailed consideration is not warranted at the\npresent time. At the stagnation point in our \"standard\nmodel\", \u03bdc = 260 MHz for \u03b3 = 100, and 26 GHz for\n\u03b3 = 104 .\nThe synchrotron emissivity formula (Eq. 9) may be\nused even for mildly relativistic electrons (e.g., \u03b3 < 2),\nprovided that \u03c7 >\n\u223c 100, where\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03bd\n=\n=\n\u03c7=\n\u03bdb\n\u03c9b\n\u03b3\u03c90\n\n(11)\n\n(see Fig. 2 of Mahadevan et al. 1996). Since \u03c7 \u221d \u03bd/B,\n\u03c7 is small when we have low frequencies and high Bfields (or, alternatively when the binary separation is\nsmall, since B \u221d 1/Dsep). The lowest frequency we examine is 200 MHz. In our \"standard model\" (see Sec. 3.1),\n\u03bdb = 1.7 \u00d7 104 Hz and B = 5.9 mG at the stagnation\npoint of the WCR, which yields \u03c7 = 1.2 \u00d7 104 when\n\u03bd = 200 MHz. The declining B-field means that \u03bdb declines with off-axis distance, which leads to higher values of \u03c7. In the most extreme case which we consider\n(Dsep = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm, \u03b6B = 10\u22122 ), \u03c7 > 100 throughout\nthe WCR, justifying our use of the synchrotron emissivity\nformula.\n\nof synchrotron emission from the WCR is \u223c 60 \u00d7 5 mas),\ngiving \u03bdSSA \u2248 20 MHz6 . For wide CWBs, SSA is negligible\nat GHz frequencies, but may become important in closer\nsystems.\n\n2.3.3. The Razin effect\nWhen relativistic charges are surrounded by a plasma\n(as opposed to existing in a vacuum), the beaming effect\nthat characterizes synchrotron radiation is suppressed. As\nnoted in Paper I, the refractive index of the medium reduces the Lorentz factor of the electron to\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u2032 = p\n,\n1 + \u03b3 2 \u03bd02 /\u03bd 2\n\nSynchrotron self-absorption (SSA) or, more accurately at\nlow \u03b3, magneto-bremsstrahlung self-absorption, is intimately linked to the energy spectrum of the non-thermal\nparticles and their magneto-bremsstrahlung emissivity,\nand in Appendix A we show how the calculation of SSA is\nperformed. The SSA turnover frequency for a source subtending a solid angle \u03a9 (steradians) is given by (for p = 2;\ncf. Pacholczyk 1970)\n\u03bdSSA = 46.3 B 1/6 S\u03bd1/3 \u03bd 1/6 \u03a9\u22121/3 Hz,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere B is in Gauss, and S\u03bd is the synchrotron flux in mJy\nat any frequency \u03bd (in Hz) where the source is optically\nthin. For our \"standard\" CWB model (without IC cooling)\nwith \u03b6 = 10\u22124 (see Sec. 3.1), the magnetic field strength\nat the apex of the WCR is 5.9 mG, S\u03bd = 0.026 mJy at\n\u03bd = 81.1 GHz, and \u03a9 \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 ster (the spatial extent\n\n(13)\n\np\nwhere the plasma frequency \u03bd0 = q 2 ne /\u03c0me .

Clumping\nThere is a great deal of evidence that the winds of hot stars\nare clumpy (e.g., Moffat et al. 1988; Robert 1994; L\u00e9pine\net al. 2000), and the effect of inhomogeneous winds on\nthe WCR is expected to be sensitive to a number of variables (e.g., Cherepashchuk 1990; L\u00e9pine 1995). Foremost\namongst these is whether the densities are low enough that\nthe WCR and the shocked clumps are adiabatic. This is\nindeed the case in the wide binary systems which we consider in this paper8 . In such a situation the clumps are\n6\n\n2.3.2. Synchrotron self-absorption\n\n5\n\nNote that the calculations in Paper I greatly overestimate\nthe strength of SSA (see, e.g., Fig. 4 in that paper). This error\nresulted from the use of Eq. 6.53 in Rybicki & Lightman (1979)\nthat takes C from Eq. 6.20a. We had assumed it was taken from\nEq. 6.20b, since this is the case for Eq. 6.36. This led to the erroneous conclusion in Paper I that the SSA turnover frequency\nand the characteristic cut-off frequency from the Razin effect\nare comparable in our \"standard\" CWB model when \u03b6 = 10\u22123 .\nWe now find that this is the case when \u03b6 \u223c 10\u22122 - see also the\ndiscussion in Sec. 3.5.\n7\nWe note that the Razin effect is slightly more subtle than\nreplacing \u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2032 in Eqs. 9 and 10, since not all of the Lorentz\nfactors in the function F (\u03bd/\u03bdc ) are related to the beaming\neffect - see, e.g., Rybicki & Lightman (1979), Ginzburg &\nSyrovatskii (1965), or Van Loo et al. (2004) for more details.\nHowever, this has little impact on the results.\n8\nThe interaction of a clumpy wind with a radiative WCR\nhas been discussed by Walder & Folini (2002). In this case\nthe WCR may become relatively narrow, though dense, and\nprone to instabilities, such as nonlinear thin-shell instabilities\n(e.g., Stevens et al. 1992; Vishniac 1994). The fate of clumps\n\n\f6\n\nJ.M. Pittard et al.: Radio emission models of Colliding-Wind Binary Systems\n\nstripped of material by a combination of dynamical processes (such as ablation) and evaporation (resulting from\nthe conduction of heat into their interiors) as they move\nwithin the WCR.\nThe destruction timescale of non-radiative clumps by\nthe action of dynamical instabilities is td = \u01ebtcc (Klein\net al. 1994), where tcc is the cloud crushing timescale,\ndefined as tcc = rc /vs , rc is the radius of the clump, and vs\nis the shock velocity (for the stationary shocks in CWBs,\nvs is equal to the pre-shock wind speed). \u01eb \u2248 3.5 for a\ndensity ratio between the clump and the inter-clump wind\nof order 10-100 (Klein et al. 1994), though larger density\nratios may occur in intrinsic wind shocks. A clump which\npasses through a shock experiences less deceleration than\nthe inter-clump material, so a lower limit on the timescale\nfor the clump to reach the contact discontinuity is tcd =\n\u2206r/vs , where \u2206r is the distance from the shock to the\nCD. Clumps will be destroyed before they reach the CD\nwhen\ntd /tcd = \u01ebtcc /tcd = \u01ebrc /\u2206r < 1.\n\n(15)\n\nThere are indications that rc \u223c 1R\u2217 at distances of\n\u223c 20R\u2217 from the star (L\u00e9pine et al. 2000; Rodrigues &\nMagalh\u00e3es 2000). Such clumps cannot expand faster than\ntheir sound speed, unless they behave isothermally, in\nwhich case they may expand a few times faster. The wind\ntemperature of hot stars is \u223c 1 \u2212 10 kK, and the sound\nspeed of the clump is \u223c 10 km s\u22121 . In WR 147, the flow\ntime of the WR wind to the stagnation point is \u223c 108 s,\nso the clumps will have expanded to radii of \u223c 1000 R\u2299 .\nIn our model of WR 147 in Sec. 4, \u2206r \u2248 0.05Dsep, when\nmeasured along the line of centres of the stars. We thus determine that td /tcd \u223c 0.5, which implies that the clumps\nare rapidly destroyed. Material originating in the clumps\nis mixed in with the post-shock gas and the high sound\nspeed of the hot WCR works to minimize the density and\npressure gradients existing in the vicinity of the clump.\nThe post-shock flow should rapidly become smooth, and\nthe global position of the shocks and the CD should be\naffected very little by the clumpy nature of the winds.\nIf td /tcd >> 1, clumps could in theory pass completely through the WCR and into the unshocked wind\nof the companion star, where they would be surrounded\nby a bowshock and subject to a high level of ablation,\nbefore being destroyed. The possibility of clumps passing\nthrough the WCR and interacting with the photosphere\nof the companion star is considered by Marchenko (2002).\nin this situation is less certain. It is possible that they will be\ndestroyed when they encounter the WCR, but since the postshock gas is itself cold and dense, new \"clumps\" may be created\nas the WCR fragments under the action of these instabilities.\nOf note is the fact that the growth rate of the thin-shell instability depends on high tangential velocities channelling material to the extremities of the kinks (Blondin & Marks 1996)\n- this channelling may be disrupted if the incident flows are\nclumpy, and the growth of this instability moderated to some\nextent, though a numerical calculation would be needed for\nconfirmation of this idea.\n\nAnother consideration is whether new clumps are created when gas in a WCR which is largely adiabatic eventually cools. We make the general statement that the growth\nof density perturbations within the WCR will depend on\ntheir size relative to the local cooling length of the surrounding gas (see Blondin & Cioffi 1989), and note that\nany non-thermal component of the pressure (e.g., from\nrelativistic particles) lessens the growth rate of the local\nthermal instability by decreasing the dependence of the total pressure on the gas pressure (e.g., Wagner et al. 2005).\nSince we know that there are non-thermal particles within\nthe WCR we assume that the cold component of the WCR\nis smooth.\nTo summarize, we can distinguish the following three\nregions where there may or may not be clumps: stellar\nwinds; hot WCR; cold WCR. We have demonstrated that\nclumps are rapidly destroyed in systems where the WCR\nis largely adiabatic, and have noted that clumps are less\nlikely to be created within the WCR when there is supporting pressure from non-thermal particles. Therefore,\nwe assume that all parts of the WCR are smooth, leaving only the nature of the stellar winds to be specified.\nSince the predominant effect of clumping is to introduce a\nscaling factor to the thermal emission, in our \"standard\"\nmodel in Sec. 3.1 we assume that the stellar winds are\nsmooth. However, our models for WR 147 in Sec. 4 adopt\nclumpy winds in order to match the observed free-free\nemission with specific mass-loss rates.\n\n2.5. Summary of the calculations\nOur calculation of the observed radio emission from CWB\nsystems is based on the density and temperature distribution obtained from a hydrodynamical simulation of the\nstellar winds and their collision. Both the stellar winds\nand the WCR contribute thermal emission and absorption. Free-free emission and absorption from thermal electrons is calculated as noted in Paper I, and clumping may\nor may not be included in the model. In addition, the\nWCR has emission and absorption components arising\nfrom a distribution of non-thermal electrons accelerated\nat the shocks and advected with the downstream flow.\nTo describe the non-thermal electron energy distribution we use 100, logarithmically spaced, energy bins, extending from \u03b3 = 1 to \u03b3max , and which we specify as a\npower-law at the shocks. The pre-cooled normalization of\nthis energy spectrum in each cell within the WCR is obtained by setting the total non-thermal electron energy\ndensity to a specified fraction of the thermal energy density (see Eq. 2). Scalars in the hydrodynamical code are\nthen used to apply IC and ionic cooling, and a \"cooled\"\nnon-thermal electron energy distribution is obtained in\neach hydrodynamical cell. As a result, the energy distribution in each cell within the WCR shows some degree\nof evolution away from its initial power-law (see, e.g.,\nFig. 3a). In the downstream flow, the energy loss from\nthe non-thermal electrons means that Urel \u2264 \u03b6Uth . Since\n\n\fJ.M. Pittard et al.: Radio emission models of Colliding-Wind Binary Systems\n\nB\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\nA\n\n7\n\n(\u0116 \u221d 1/Dsep), a two-fluid implementation of the postshock flow is ideally needed.\nFinally, we emphasize that in our current model the hydrodynamics of the WCR is solved in the limit that a negligible amount of energy is placed into non-thermal particles. In reality, efficient particle acceleration may greatly\nmodify the structure of the shocks bounding the WCR\nand the post-shock flow. Our work in Sec. 4 indicates that\nsuch changes may actually take place.\n\n3. Parameter study\n3.1. A standard model\n\n\u2720\n\nFig. 2. A density plot of the standard model (showing only the\npositive z-region). The WR star is at (0,0). To aid subsequent\ndiscussion, two points in the post-shock flow are highlighted:\na position close to the stagnation point (position \"A\"), and\na position some distance off-axis in the shocked gas (position\n\"B\").\n\nthe magnetic energy density in each hydrodynamical cell\nremains tied to Uth , the magnetic field and non-thermal\nelectron energy densities gradually diverge, with UB exceeding Urel in the downstream flow. Electrons which cool\nto \u03b3 = 1 are assumed to return to the thermal pool.\nWith the non-thermal electron energy distribution and\nthe B-field specified in every hydrodynamical cell within\nthe WCR, the non-thermal emission and absorption may\nbe calculated. If the Razin effect is specified, the debeaming is first calculated and the effective \u03b3 of each energy bin is reduced according to Eq. 13. The magnetobremsstrahlung emissivity per electron is then calculated\nusing Eq. 9. The magneto-bremsstrahlung emissivity per\nunit volume is obtained from multiplying the emissivity\nper electron by the number density of non-thermal electrons. Integration over \u03b3 then gives the total non-thermal\nemission per unit volume. Synchrotron self-absorption is\ncalculated in a similar fashion. Finally, the radiative transfer equation is solved to generate synthetic images and\nspectra.\n\n2.6. Some simplifying assumptions\nThe simplifying assumptions mentioned in Sec. 2.6 of\nPaper I apply also to the work in this paper. An additional\nassumption which was not discussed previously relates to\nthe issue of thermal cooling of hot plasma in the WCR.\nThis is of relevance since the magnetic energy density UB ,\nand the energy density of relativistic electrons Urel , are\nassumed to be related to the thermal energy density Uth .\nWhen the separation between the stars is sufficiently small\nthat significant cooling of the thermal plasma takes place\n\nAs with our initial investigations in Paper I, we examine\nthe radio emission from a \"standard\" CWB model with\nthe following parameters: \u1e40 WR = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\n\u1e40 O = 2\u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , v\u221e,WR = v\u221e,O = 2000 km s\u22121 ,\nDsep = 2 \u00d7 1015 cm. The wind momentum ratio, \u03b7 =\n\u1e40 O v\u221e,O /\u1e40 WR v\u221e,WR = 0.1, and the distance of the\nstagnation point from the WR and O star is respectively\nrWR = 0.76Dsep and rO = 0.24Dsep. With such parameters the WCR is largely adiabatic. We assume solar abundances for the O star and WC-type abundances for the\nWR star (mass fractions X = 0, Y = 0.75, Z = 0.25).\nTemperatures of 10, 000 K and an ionization structure of\nH+ , He+ and CNO2+ are assumed for the unshocked stellar winds. The wind temperatures are lower than those\nused in Paper I, but as the thermal flux from the unshocked winds is only weakly dependent on the wind temperature (through the gaunt factor), this change has only a\nsmall effect on the free-free emission (see Sec. 3.4). As before, we adopt a distance of 1.0 kpc for our model system,\nand assume that \u03b6 = 10\u22124 . As noted in Sec. 2.3.2, SSA\nis negligible at GHz frequencies in the standard model.\nHowever, since B \u221d \u03b6 1/2 , and S\u03bd \u221d \u03b6 7/4 in the optically\nthin limit, we find that \u03bdSSA \u221d \u03b6 2/3 . The SSA turnover\nfrequency is \u2248 0.2 GHz when \u03b6 = 10\u22122 .\nSince IC cooling is now included in the models, appropriate luminosities for the stars must also be defined.\nWe set LWR = 2 \u00d7 105 L\u2299 and LO = 5 \u00d7 105 L\u2299 for this\nfirst investigation which results in a photon energy density Uph = 2.3 erg cm\u22123 at the stagnation point9 . For the\ninitial non-thermal energy spectrum at the shocks, we assume a power-law energy distribution with p = 2 and fix\n\u03b3min = 1 and \u03b3max = 105 . This latter value is roughly the\n\u03b3 at which the energy gain due to shock acceleration is balanced by the energy loss due to IC cooling, for electrons\nnear the apex of the WCR - see Sec. 2.2.3.\nAll of our 2D axisymmetric hydrodynamical calculations for the standard model use a square grid with\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 4 \u00d7 1015 cm, 0 \u2264 z \u2264 4 \u00d7 1015 cm. The z-axis\nis extended to \u22124 \u00d7 1015 cm with appropriate density and\n9\n\nWe estimate LWR and LO from the following empirical\nformulae. LWR is calculated from the relationship log \u1e40 =\n1.38logL \u2212 12.1 for Galactic WC stars (Crowther 2003), while\nLO is determined from log\u1e40 = 1.69logL \u2212 15.4 (Howarth &\nPrinja 1989).\n\n\fJ.M.

In c) and d) the magneto-bremsstrahlung emissivity resulting from these energy distributions is shown.\nThe low frequency cutoff can be influenced by a number of processes. Here, the dashed curves show the Razin effect as an\nexample.

The salient features of the standard model\nFigs. 2 and 3 illustrate the salient features of our modelling. The density distribution of the unshocked stellar\nwinds and WCR in our standard model is shown in Fig. 2.\n\n9\n\nTwo locations in the post-shock flow are highlighted, one\nnear the stagnation point (\"A\"), and another (\"B\") at an\noff-axis position. Comparison of Figs. 3a and 3b yields several points worth noting. First, because the non-thermal\nelectron energy density at \"A\" is greater than that at \"B\",\nthe \"initial\" energy spectrum (dotted line) has a higher\nnormalization in Fig. 3a. Second, the effects of IC and\nionic cooling are more significant at \"A\" (solid lines). IC\ncooling is high for flow close to the stars since the intensity of the radiation field is high, and near the stagnation point the flow speed is also low, so the exposure time\nis longer. In the standard model, IC cooling is responsible for the decline in \u03b3max from 105 (the assumed initial\nvalue) to approximately 200 for flow near the stagnation\npoint (Fig. 3a), while for the off-axis position this decline\nstops at \u2248 4000 (Fig. 3b). The turn down in the electron spectrum at low \u03b3 seen in Figs. 3a and 3b is due to\nionic cooling. This effect is again strongest for flow near\nthe stagnation point due to the higher ionic density and\nslower flow speeds which exist there.\nThe magneto-bremsstrahlung emission resulting from\nthe \"cooled\" relativistic energy spectra in Figs. 3a and 3b\nare shown by the solid lines in Figs. 3c and 3d respectively.\nThe higher energy electrons that reside at position \"B\"\nproduce magneto-bremsstrahlung emission extending to\nhigher frequencies (\u223c 103 GHz, versus \u223c 10 GHz at position \"A\"; see also Eqs. 9 and 10). Thus, flow positions subject to high IC cooling produce magneto-bremsstrahlung\nemission over a smaller range in frequency than positions\nwith less cooling. With the Razin effect included, a lowfrequency cut-off to the magneto-bremsstrahlung spectra\nis seen as a result of its de-beaming influence, as shown by\nthe dashed curves in Figs. 3c and 3d. It is also worth bearing in mind that the lower normalization of the relativistic energy spectrum at \"B\" (Fig. 3b) versus \"A\" (Fig. 3a)\nmeans that at 1 GHz the emissivity per unit volume is\nover an order of magnitude higher at position \"A\".\n\n3.4. Spectral and intensity distributions\nThe spectra and intensity distributions obtained from our\nstandard model are shown in Fig. 4 and the left column\nof Fig. 5, respectively. For simplicity, the only absorption process included in Figs. 4 and 5 is free-free absorption. Synchrotron emission dominates the total flux below\n1 GHz. The turnover seen near 400 MHz is due to freefree absorption from the unshocked stellar winds. Above\n400 MHz, the synchrotron spectrum is a power-law with\na spectral index10 \u03b1 = \u2212(p \u2212 1)/2 = \u22120.5 for p = 2 (see\nSec. 2). The thermal spectrum is also a power-law with a\nspectral index of +0.6, as expected. The slight departure\nof the thermal emission from a power-law at low frequencies is due to the finite size of our hydrodynamical grid.\nThe thermal flux is essentially the sum of the theoretical\n10\n\nThe flux S\u03bd at frequency \u03bd, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 , where \u03b1 is the spectral\nindex.\n\n\f10\n\nJ.M. Pittard et al.: Radio emission models of Colliding-Wind Binary Systems\n\nFig. 5. The impact of IC cooling on the intensity distributions of our standard model, for a viewing angle of 0\u25e6 and at 1.6 GHz\n(top) and 22 GHz (bottom). Neither the Razin effect nor SSA are included in this calculation. The images on the left do not\ninclude IC cooling, while those on the right do. Each image has the same intensity scale and contours.\n\nflux from each wind (cf. Table 1). However, this is not\nalways the case (see Sec. 3.7 and Figs. 10 and 11).\nThe effect of IC cooling on spectra from our standard\nmodel is shown by the dot-dash line in Fig. 4. Its effect\nis greatest at high frequencies, as demonstrated by the\nmarked decrease of the synchrotron spectral component.\nHowever, while this effect is most severe at high frequencies, IC cooling reduces the flux in the entire 0.1-100 GHz\nfrequency range. It is interesting that we do not see a break\nin the synchrotron spectrum, in spite of its clear signature\nin Figs. 3c and 3d. This is because the frequency of the\nbreak in the synchrotron spectrum is spatially dependent\n(compare Figs. 3c and 3d), and once integrated over the\nentire WCR the frequency break is smeared out and thus\nnot visible in the final spectrum. A clearly defined break\nfrequency is also lacking in single star models where the\nsynchrotron emission arises from shocks intrinsic to the\nwind (Van Loo et al. 2005).\nSpatially, the effect of IC cooling is to reduce the\nbrightness of the synchrotron emission from the WCR, but\nmore so near the CD than near the shocks (see Fig. 5).\n\n3.5. Impact of IC cooling and binary separation on the\nsynchrotron emission\nThe dramatic effect of IC cooling on the resulting spectra and intensity distributions should be even more pronounced when the separation between the stars is smaller.\nIn Fig. 6 we show the increasing effect of IC cooling on the\nsynchrotron emission as the stellar separation is decreased\nfrom Dsep = 2 \u00d7 1015 cm to Dsep = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm. Since the\n\u22121/2\nintrinsic synchrotron flux scales as Dsep , we have normalized the pre-IC cooled spectrum of each model to that\nobtained at Dsep = 2\u00d71015 cm. This allows easier comparison of the divergence between the intrinsic and IC cooled\nspectra as a function of Dsep . The clear trend is for the\nIC cooled synchrotron spectra to steepen with decreasing\nDsep .\nThe spectra and intensity distributions from our full\nmodel (including IC cooling, the Razin effect, SSA and\nfree-free absorption) as a function of stellar separation are\nshown in Figs. 7 and 8. While the intrinsic synchrotron\nemission increases with decreasing Dsep , the influence of\n\n\fJ.M.

The spectra are\nnormalized so that the intrinsic emission spectra (i.e. without\nfree-free absorption, SSA, the Razin effect, or IC cooling) are\nequal to the intrinsic spectrum at Dsep = 20 \u00d7 1014 cm (solid\nline).\n\n1\n\nSynchrotron Flux (mJy)\n\n7/4\n\n\u22121\nas \u03bdSSA \u221d \u03b6 2/3 \u1e40 Dsep\n, since S\u03bd \u221d \u03b6 7/4 \u1e40 Dsep and\n2\n\u03a9 \u221d Dsep . Therefore the turnover frequencies resulting\nfrom the Razin effect and SSA are both \u221d 1/Dsep. If we ignore free-free absorption for the moment, we find that the\nlow-frequency turnover in our standard model is caused by\n\u22122\nthe Razin effect rather than SSA when \u03b6B = \u03b6rel <\n\u223c 10\n(departures from equipartition are examined in the next\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n2\n5\n20\n20\n\n0.01\n\n5\n2\n\n0.001\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\nFig. 7.

In each case the pre-IC\ncooled intrinsic synchrotron spectrum and the observed ICcooled synchrotron spectrum are shown.\n\nIC cooling (at high frequencies) and free-free absorption\nand the Razin effect (at low frequencies) means that the\nobserved synchrotron emission may decrease with decreasing separation, which is consistent with the non-detection\nof non-thermal emission from short period CWB systems.\nThe low-frequency turnover in Fig. 7 is completely\n\u22122\ndue to the Razin effect.

This is indeed observed, and the turnover\nfrequencies are in excellent agreement with Eq. 14. In contrast, the turnover frequency due to SSA (cf. Eq. 12) scales\n\nsubsection). Since \u03bdSSA /\u03bdR \u221d \u03b6 7/6 \u1e40 , the SSA turnover\nfrequency may exceed \u03bdR when \u1e40 and particularly \u03b6 are\nlarge. The turnover frequency due to free-free absorption\ndepends on the viewing angle into the system, and as it\nhas a steeper dependence on Dsep than either the Razin\n\u221210/7\neffect or SSA (\u03bdff \u221d Dsep\n- see Paper I), it is increasingly likely that the low-frequency turnover will be caused\nby free-free absorption as Dsep decreases.\nAt the high frequency end of the spectra in Fig. 7,\nthe difference between the observed and intrinsic synchrotron flux is entirely due to IC cooling. With the Bfield used in the standard model, the emission at a given\nfrequency arises from electrons with fairly high values of \u03b3\n(cf. Eq. 10). Thus the influence of IC cooling is fairly high,\nand this is reflected in the curvature in the synchrotron\nspectra at high frequencies. As Dsep decreases, IC cooling\nbecomes increasingly important, and we find that high\nfrequency synchrotron emission is confined to very thin\nregions immediately behind the shocks. The synchrotron\nemission behind the WR shock can be appreciably higher\nthan that behind the O shock, since the non-thermal electrons are further removed from the O star in this case.\nFig. 8 shows that the maximum intensity of the emission from the WCR may increase with decreasing binary separation. However, the bottom panel of Fig. 7\nreveals that the synchrotron emission at 1.6 GHz when\nDsep = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm is negligible, as it is greatly reduced by\nthe Razin effect. The observed emission from the WCR is\ntherefore dominated by free-free emission (the increase in\nthe free-free emission from the WCR with decreasing separation is investigated further in Sec. 3.7). The fact that\nthe WCR emission at 1.6 GHz changes from synchrotron\ndominated when Dsep = 2 \u00d7 1015 cm, to free-free dominated when Dsep = 2\u00d71014 cm, also explains why the \"V\"shaped emission from the WCR seen at Dsep = 2\u00d71015 cm\ndisappears at Dsep = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm (see Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 also shows that the emission from the WCR\nis sometimes brightest to either side of the apex of the\nWCR, due to high absorption. This is sometimes seen in\nobservations (e.g., Watson et al. 2002; Dougherty et al.\n2005), though it may also arise from time variability in\nthe structure of the WCR.\n\n3.6. Departures from equipartition\nSo far, we have assumed that the energy density of the\nnon-thermal electrons and the B-field are equal. This assumption was made for the sake of convenience, but it is\nquite probable that this condition is not attained. For example, the B-field energy density may be equal to the to-\n\n\f12\n\nJ.M.

We estimate the uncertainty of each data point based on the finite\nfrequency sampling in our calculations. The curve is a least\nsquares fit of a second order polynomial in log10 (\u03b6B /\u03b6rel ) to\nlog10 (\u03bd/\u03bd0 ), and is forced to go through the position (0.0, 0.0).\nThe coefficient's are 0.055, \u22120.031 and 0.0.\n\nFig. 8. Intensity distributions at 1.6 GHz and a 0\u25e6 viewing\nangle with a binary separation of 20 (top), 5 (middle), and\n2 \u00d7 1014 cm (bottom), corresponding to angular separations\nof 133, 33 and 13.3 mas respectively. The crosses denote the\npositions of the stars, with the WR star located at (0,0). Each\nimage has the same intensity scale and contours. IC cooling,\nthe Razin effect, SSA, and free-free absorption are included,\nand \u03b6 = 10\u22124 . Absorption by the WR wind is highest at the\napex of the WCR - as the binary separation decreases, the\nobserved intensity from the WCR reaches maxima either side\nof the symmetry axis. The nature of the emission from the\nWCR also changes with binary separation. In the top panel it\nis predominantly non-thermal, while in the bottom panel it is\ncompletely thermal. This dramatic change is due to the Razin\n\u22121\nturnover frequency scaling as \u03bdR \u221d Dsep\n.\n\ntal non-thermal energy density from electrons and ions. In\nfact, some astrophysical sources are far from having Urel =\nUB (e.g., in some very compact radio sources, Kellermann\n& Pauliny-Toth (1981) note that Urel /UB > 1010 !). We\nhave therefore explored the effect of varying the ratio\n\u03b6B /\u03b6rel . In essence, this allows us to explore how changes\nin the B-field affect the emission. The energy density of\nnon-thermal ions has no effect on the radio emission.\nWhen \u03b6B is kept constant and \u03b6rel varied, the synchrotron spectrum simply scales in flux as S\u03bd \u221d \u03b6rel (see\nEq. 6 in Paper I). However, when \u03b6rel is kept constant\nand \u03b6B varied the turnover frequency changes\n\u221a as well as\nthe normalization, since \u03bdR \u221d 1/B \u221d 1/ \u03b6B . At high\nvalues of \u03b6B we expect SSA to succeed the Razin effect as\nthe dominant absorption process behind the low frequency\nturnover in the synchrotron spectrum. When this happens\nwe expect the turnover frequency to scale as \u03bdSSA \u221d B 1/6\n(see Eq. 12). Our calculations show that it is relatively\neasy to achieve a turnover in the synchrotron spectrum\nat fairly high frequencies through the Razin effect by reducing \u03b6B , but difficult to achieve turnovers through SSA\neven a little above that obtained when \u03b6B = \u03b6rel since the\ndependence of \u03bdSSA on B is weak, and requires commensurately large values of B. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 where\nwe plot the normalized turnover frequency as a function\nof \u03b6B /\u03b6rel .\n\n3.7. The thermal flux and binary separation\nThe effect of binary separation on the thermal flux from\nthe WCR has not previously been considered. As noted\nby Stevens (1995), the free-free emissivity from the WCR\nis slightly enhanced compared to that from the unshocked\n\n\fJ.M.

The intrinsic thermal emission from the WCR (before free-free absorption) is shown by the dot-dashed line.\nSynchrotron emission is not displayed.\n\nwinds, at an equivalent distance from the system centre,\nsince \u03b5ff\u03bd \u221d \u03c12 T \u22121/2 gff . In the WCR the density is typically\n4\u00d7 higher (cf. the jump conditions for a strong shock), the\ntemperature is of order 102 \u2212 104 \u00d7 higher, with perhaps a\ntypical increase of a factor of 103 , and the Gaunt factor is\napproximately double that of the ambient gas. In contrast,\nthe free-free absorption is reduced by a factor of \u223c 103 ,\nsince \u03b1ff\u03bd \u221d \u03c12 T \u22123/2 gff . If the unshocked winds are clumpy,\nand the gas in the WCR basically smooth (see Sec. 2.4),\nthe difference in absorption can be even larger.\nIn Fig. 10 we show the relative contribution to the\ntotal thermal emission of the unshocked winds and the\nWCR. Notably, the high frequency thermal spectrum of\nthe WCR has a spectral index which is indicative of optically thin thermal emission, quite unlike that from the\nunshocked stellar wind. The intrinsic thermal emission\nfrom the WCR is strongly absorbed at low frequencies,\nmostly by free-free absorption from the unshocked winds\n(i.e. from gas external to the WCR), with a small contribution from absorption internal to the WCR. The slight\ncurvature in the unshocked wind emission at low frequencies is a result of the finite size of the computational grid.\nWe find that the thermal emission from the WCR increases as the binary separation decreases, while the thermal emission from the unshocked winds remains broadly\n\u22124\nthe same. Since \u03b5ff\u03bd \u221d \u03c12 \u221d Dsep\nand the volume of the\n3\nWCR scales as Dsep , the thermal emission from the WCR\n\u22121\nscales as Dsep\n. Since the emission from the WCR is optically thin, we see a substantial fraction of this emission at certain viewing angles, and at small separations\nthe contribution of the WCR to the total thermal flux\ncan be significant. A dramatic consequence of this is that\na composite-like spectrum (Fig. 10), often presumed to\nbe evidence for non-thermal emission, can result entirely\n\n13\n\nfrom thermal processes! The spectral index between 5 and\n15 GHz of the total emission in Fig. 10 is \u2248 0.4, with the\nresult that the free-free emission from this model would\nbe classified as a \"composite\" spectrum if it was included\nin the observational analysis of Dougherty & Williams\n(2000). Nevertheless, we believe that a non-thermal origin\nis the most likely explanation in all of the systems noted\nin Dougherty & Williams (2000) since these are typically\nwide systems.\nIn Fig. 11a we show how the total thermal flux varies\nwith binary separation and viewing angle at \u03bd = 15 GHz.\nAt wide separations and a 0\u25e6 viewing angle, the total thermal flux from the system (the sum of the thermal emission\nfrom the unshocked winds and from the WCR) approaches\nthe sum of the theoretical free-free flux from each stellar\nwind. This is because the WCR occurs well outside the R1\nradius of emission of each wind (see Table 1), and its contribution to the emission is negligible since the intrinsic\n\u22121\nthermal emission from the WCR scales as Dsep\n. In closer\nsystems, the WCR moves within the R1 radius of each\nwind and removes a segment of their emission. However,\nthe resulting reduction in flux from the unshocked winds\nis more than compensated for by the increase in thermal emission from the WCR. Therefore, the total thermal\nemission can considerably exceed that expected from the\ntwo stellar winds. For example, when Dsep = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm,\nthe thermal flux from the standard model exceeds the total theoretical thermal flux by more than 20%. The excess could be considerably higher at smaller separations\nand lower frequencies. The effect is smaller at higher frequencies, since R1 \u221d \u03bd \u22120.7 . Fig. 11a also shows that the\nobserved flux is reduced when one star is in front of the\nother (\u00b190\u25e6 ), as one would expect.\nThe nature and degree of clumping may also affect\nhow the free-free flux scales with binary separation. If the\nunshocked winds are clumpy, but the WCR smooth due\nto rapid destruction of the clumps, the thermal flux may\nactually decrease with decreasing separation, as shown in\nFig. 11b. This is because as the stars move closer together,\nthe increased emission from the WCR is more than offset\nby the decrease in the overall amount of clumpy material\nin the system. Whether the thermal flux increases with decreasing binary separation in a particular system depends\non the nature and degree of clumping in that system.\n\n3.8. Synchrotron emission and wind-momentum ratio\nFree-free absorption by the surrounding stellar winds can\nhave a large affect on the observable low frequency synchrotron emission. In previous models where the nonthermal emission is treated as arising from a point source,\nthe free-free absorption by the stellar winds is determined\nalong a single line of sight. Since the spatial extent of the\nWCR is ignored in such models, the low opacity within\nthe WCR is also disregarded. In our models, the spatial\nextent of the WCR means that there are multiple linesof-sight to the WCR. The amount of free-free absorption\n\n\f14\n\nJ.M.

The half-opening angle\nof the WR shock, the CD, and the O shock as a function\nof \u03b7 are noted in Table 211 . The main characteristic is an\nincrease in absorption of the synchrotron emission when\nthe lines of sight to the apex of the WCR pass close to\neither star.\nHere we vary \u03b7 by changing \u1e40 O , so it is not surprising to see that the absorption at +90\u25e6 is highest when \u03b7\nis highest (i.e. \u1e40 O highest). When the O star is in front,\nthe amount of free-free absorption depends on the ratio of\nR1O /rO (Eichler & Usov 1993). At 1.6 GHz, this ratio is\n11\n\nEichler & Usov (1993) provide an analytical expression for\nthe half-opening angle of the CD, \u03b8cd (their Eq. 3). However,\nthe statement that the angle between the two shocks, \u2206\u03b8 \u223c \u03b8,\nis inaccurate, as the data in Table 2 shows. Instead we find that\n\u2206\u03b8 \u2248 35 \u2212 40\u25e6 for the range of \u03b7 noted in Table 2, whereas \u03b8\nchanges by almost a factor of 2.\n\n0.58, 0.40, and 0.30 for \u03b7 = 0.316, 0.1, and 0.0316, respectively. Larger values of R1O /rO result in higher absorption,\nwhich is in agreement with Fig. 12a. We naively expected\nthat the synchrotron emission would be least affected by\nabsorption when the observer looks down the WCR into\nthe system. However, we find that in all 3 cases, the absorption is a minimum at viewing angles which are close\nto the asymptotic angle of the WR shock, and steadily\nincreases as the viewing angle swings from being parallel\nto the WR shock to being parallel to the O shock. We\nattribute this finding to the fact that even when the viewing angle is within the WCR, the far side of the WCR is\nabsorbed by the O star wind, and note that there are implications for any observing strategy attempting to detect\nradio bursts in CWB systems (e.g., in \u03b3 2 Velorum).\nIt is also interesting that the model with \u03b7 = 0.316\nshows the lowest relative absorption when the viewing angle is \u221290\u25e6 . We attribute this to the wider opening angle\nof the WCR in the model, and the fact that more of the\nWCR is visible when \u03b7 is high. Though not shown here,\nthe variation with viewing angle is reduced at higher frequencies, since R1 \u221d \u03bd \u22120.7 .\n\nThe variation in synchrotron flux with viewing angle is\nmore pronounced at smaller binary separations, as shown\nin Fig. 12b, where the values of R1O /rO are 4\u00d7 larger than\npreviously. In all of the models in Fig. 12b, the drop in\nemission as the sightlines move out of the WCR is steeper\non the WR side.\nIf an observer's line of sight into the system lies in the\norbital plane, two bursts of radio emission will be seen as\nthe WCR sweeps past, as suggested by Eichler & Usov\n(1993). We find that this occurs if R1O /rO >\n\u223c 0.4. When\nR1O /rO >\n2,\nthe\nburst\nis\nconfined\nto\na\nrange\nin viewing\n\u223c\nangle equal to \u2206\u03b8.

Values for R1O /rO are noted next to\neach curve. The angular range of the WCR for the model with \u03b7 = 0.316 is shown by the shaded region, with the asymptotic\nangles of the WR and O shocks delimiting its edges. b) As a) but where the binary separation (hence rO ) is reduced by a factor\nof 4 to 5 \u00d7 1014 cm.\n\nthe WCR, only one such burst per orbit may be seen.\nIn contrast, the behaviour of the system with \u03b7 = 0.0316\nshown in Fig. 12a is better characterized as a single decline\nin synchrotron emission when the WR star is in front of\nthe O star, since the emission remains high even when the\nO star is directly in front of the WR star.\nThe complexity demonstrated in Fig. 12 further illustrates the need for models which take into account the\nspatial extent of the emission and absorption.\n\n4. The radio spectrum of WR 147\nHaving explored how the radio flux is affected by IC cooling, binary separation, the wind momentum ratio, and\nvariations in the B-field, we once again turn our attention\nto the modelling of a specific system. WR 147 is one of\nthe brightest CWB systems, and is also one of the systems where the stellar wind of the WR star and the WCR\nhave been resolved at radio wavelengths (Williams et al.\n1997). In addition, WR 147 has one of the most extensively observed radio spectra of any of the CWB systems,\nwith observations from 353 MHz to 43 GHz.\nIn Paper I, we demonstrated a number of fits of our\nCWB models to the synchrotron spectrum of WR 147.\nHowever, those models suffer from two main problems.\nFirstly, the optically-thick turnover at \u223c 1 GHz was attributed to SSA which we have discovered subsequently\nwas miscalculated (see earlier footnote), and a new fit\nwith the corrected model code is now required. Secondly,\nthe synchrotron spectrum we were attempting to fit in\nPaper I had been derived from the observed total fluxes\nand an extrapolated thermal spectrum for the stellar wind\nemission based on the flux of the WR star stellar wind at\nseveral high frequencies (e.g., Setia Gunawan et al. 2001).\n\nThough a reasonable approach, the resulting synchrotron\nspectrum exhibits considerable variation dependent on the\nadopted thermal model. In an attempt to address this\nproblem, here we aim to fit the observed total radio emission at each of the observed frequencies, and show the\ncontributing synchrotron and thermal spectra from the\nmodel.\nObservations of WR 147 are available from a number of\nauthors. These are summarised in Table 3. Skinner et al.\n(1999) used two methods to obtain flux estimates from the\nsame data, and these show considerable scatter. We have\ntaken the liberty of quoting an average of the values from\nthat paper. It appears that WR 147 is variable at some\nfrequencies (Setia Gunawan et al. 2001), so where observations at multiple epochs are available (e.g., Churchwell\net al. 1992; Contreras et al. 1996; Contreras & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez\n1999), we have quoted an average flux. To attain a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty in the flux values, we\nquote either the variance of the observations (where there\nare multiple observations), or an estimate of the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale, whichever is largest. For\nthe uncertainty in the flux scale, we adopt 5% for frequencies 15 GHz and greater, and 2% for frequencies less\nthan 15 GHz (Perley & Taylor 2003). We believe that our\napproach to estimating the observed fluxes from WR 147\nis very conservative, but it at least makes an attempt at\nassessing the relative merits of all observations in the literature, and takes into account the impact of variability.\nWR 147 is a very wide system with a projected separation Dsep cos i = 0.635 \u00b1 0.020\u2032\u2032(Williams et al. 1997),\nwhere i is the angle at which we view the system. At the\nestimated distance of \u223c 0.65 kpc (Churchwell et al. 1992;\nMorris et al. 2000) this corresponds to a separation Dsep \u223c\n415/ cos i AU.

We use the stellar wind\nparameters from Paper I: \u1e40 WN8 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nv\u221eWN8 = 950 km s\u22121 , v\u221eOB = 1000 km s\u22121 and \u1e40 OB =\n3.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , giving a wind momentum ratio \u03b7 =\n0.02 (Pittard et al. 2002). Of these parameters, \u1e40 OB is\nthe most uncertain. This is partly due to the considerable uncertainty in the companion's spectral type - estimates range from B0.5 (Williams et al. 1997) to O5-7\nI-II (L\u00e9pine et al. 2001). The luminosity of the companion\n(LOB ) ranges from \u223c 105 \u2212 106 L\u2299 , resulting in considerable scope for varying the degree of IC cooling in the\nmodels. The composition of the WN8 stellar wind is taken\nfrom Morris et al. (2000), giving X = 0.09, Y = 0.89, and\nZ = 0.016. The wind temperature for both stellar winds\nwas assumed to be 10 kK, and the dominant ionization\nstates were H+ , He+ and CNO2+ .\nFirstly, we wish to repeat the modelling done in Paper\nI to evaluate the impact of the miscalculated SSA. The\nresulting models are shown in Fig. 13. As mentioned earlier, SSA has little impact at the frequencies of the observations in these systems, and we have to turn to other\nmechanisms to generate the optically thick turnover. With\n\u03b6B = \u03b6rel , we find that the low frequency turnover is\ncontrolled by free-free absorption along the line-of-sight\nthrough the circum-binary stellar wind envelope, which is\ncontrary to the conclusion from Paper I. The line-of-sight\nopacity changes with the viewing angle of the model: positive and negative viewing angles pass first through the O\nstar wind and the denser WR star wind respectively. As\na result, large negative angles are more opaque than large\npositive values, resulting in lower observed fluxes at low\nfrequencies with negative viewing angles. The quality of\nthe fits in Fig. 13 is largely determined by the model emission at 353 MHz, with little variation between models at\nall other observed frequencies. The \u221230\u25e6 model matches\nthe 353 MHz data the best, though we have made no attempt to adjust parameters in the model to improve any of\nthe fits. Rather, models A-C are intended to demonstrate\n\n0\n10\n\n-30\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\nFig. 13. Model spectra for WR 147, including total (solid),\nsynchrotron (dashed), and thermal (dotted) flux. The observations (solid circles) are from Table 3. The open circles are\nsynchroton fluxes estimated by subtracting the thermal model\nfrom the total observed fluxes. Viewing angles of \u221230\u25e6 (model\nA), 0\u25e6 (model B), and 30\u25e6 (model C) are shown. All models\nused \u03b7 = 0.02, \u03b3max = 105 , LOB = 105 L\u2299 , \u03b6 = 7.66 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\nand a wind filling factor, f , of 0.139. The spectral index of the\nnon-thermal electrons, p, was assumed to be 2. A slight curvature to the optically thin part of the synchrotron spectrum\n(cf. Fig. 4) arises from IC cooling.\n\nthe impact of changing the viewing angle on the behaviour\nof the low frequency spectrum. \u03b6B and \u03b6rel are held constant in models A-C, and their ratio is set to 1. The intrinsic synchrotron luminosity from model B is slightly higher\nthan that in models A and C because the stars in model\nB are closer together and this model has a viewing angle\nof 0\u25e6 . The fit to the 353 MHz data point is very sensitive\nto the viewing angle, and once this point is fit moderately\nwell, the goodness-of-fit of the spectral models is largely\ndetermined by the flux computed at 1.4 and 5 GHz, given\nthe smaller uncertainties we have derived for the observed\nfluxes at these two frequencies. We have calculated further\n\n\fJ.M. Pittard et al.: Radio emission models of Colliding-Wind Binary Systems\n\n100\n\nFlux (mJy)\n\nmodels at various viewing angles, and find that we cannot\nobtain satisfactory fits to both the 1.4 and 5 GHz data\npoints with \u03b6B = \u03b6rel .\nIn an attempt to improve the spectral fit, we have calculated numerous models designed to explore the relevant\nparameter space. Firstly, we varied the wind momentum\nratio in the range 0.02 \u2212 0.012 (Pittard et al. 2002). Since\nthe half-opening angle of the WCR is only weakly dependent on \u03b7 in this range (\u03b8cd \u221d \u03b7 1/3 , see Eichler & Usov\n1993), for a given viewing angle there is very little difference to the shape of the spectrum. The normalization\nof the free-free and synchrotron emission changes slightly,\nbut this can be compensated for by adjusting the degree\nof clumping and the value of \u03b6, respectively. We also performed calculations with an increased amount of clumping\nin the undisturbed winds, with the mass-loss rates of both\nstars adjusted downwards in order to obtain the desired\namount of free-free emission. Changing the volume filling\nfactor of the clumps from f = 0.139 to f = 0.03 produces\nan insignificant change in the flux at 353 MHz.\nTo simulate crudely a decrease in acceleration efficiency at the shocks away from the line-of-centers between\nthe stars, we have also calculated models where the synchrotron emission and absorption is limited to a region\nwithin \u03c0rO /2 of the axis of symmetry of the WCR. While\nthis distance is somewhat arbitrary, we note that this\nchange has only a small effect on the synchrotron spectrum once it is renormalized (by increasing \u03b6).\nThe basic problem with all of the models noted so far\nis their total emission spectrum is too flat between 1.5\nand 5 GHz (see Fig 13). The fit in this frequency range\ncan be improved by shifting the low-frequency turnover\nin the model synchrotron spectrum to a higher frequency.\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 13, fits to these two data points\ncannot be achieved effectively with free-free opacity alone.\nThe turnover can be moved to a higher frequency by decreasing the magnetic energy density relative to the relativistic energy density, which increases the impact of the\nRazin effect (recall \u03bdR \u221d 1/B). We induce this reduction\nin the magnetic energy density by setting \u03b6B 6= \u03b6rel , as described in Sec. 3.6. The resulting synchrotron spectra are\nshown in Fig. 14, where it is clear that the turnover due\nto the Razin effect moves to higher frequencies as \u03b6B /\u03b6rel\ndecreases. The best fit to the 1.4 and 5 GHz data is attained with \u03b6B /\u03b6rel = 10\u22124 , which also gives the best fit\nto all other data points except that at 353 MHz, which\nis poor. No attempt has been made to improve the fits in\nmodels D-H by adjusting any other parameters, though\n\u03b6B and \u03b6rel were adjusted to renormalize the spectrum in\norder to keep the comparison simple. When we reduce \u03b6B\nthe synchrotron luminosity drops, and we must increase\n\u03b6rel in order to maintain a specific synchrotron luminosity. This has the consequence that the value of \u03b6rel is very\nclose to unity in model H.\nA better fit to the 353 MHz data point can be attained, in part, by increasing the viewing angle to reduce\nthe impact of free-free opacity. We have attempted to fit\nthe data by varying the viewing angle, \u03b6B and \u03b6rel . The\n\n17\n\nD\n\n10\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\n1\n\nH\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\nFig. 14.

At the high frequency end the model\ncan be made to more closely fit the data points by reducing \u03b3max , though given the uncertainty in the data points,\nthis has little impact on the goodness of the model fit.\nA fundamental concern is the models suggest the DSA\nprocess in WR 147 is highly efficient, with an uncomfortably large fraction of the pre-shock energy transferred to\nthe non-thermal electrons. While there are several ways\nin which the model assumptions might lead us to overestimate \u03b6rel (e.g., the magnetic field in the WCR may\nnot be completely tangled resulting in anisotropic emission; the thermal energy density of the WCR may have\n\n\f18\n\nJ.M.

The thermal emission\nmodel is the same as used in Fig. 13.\n\nbeen underestimated through our choice of mass-loss rates\nand/or wind speeds, etc.), these possible solutions are either rather unsatisfactory in themselves, and/or unlikely\nto substantially increase \u03b6B /\u03b6rel . We note instead that in\nsituations where the particle acceleration is highly efficient, the shock precursor (which influences the subshock\ncompression, the injection and acceleration efficiencies,\nand the shape of the non-thermal particle energy spectrum) is modified by the back-pressure of energetic particles (e.g., Ellison et al. 2004). As noted in Sec. 2.2, this\ncan create a concave curvature to the energy spectrum of\nthe non-thermal particles, where p decreases with increasing energy. Two other effects can change the overall slope\nof the energy spectrum. First, the softer equation of state\nof the relativistic particles makes the shock plasma more\ncompressible, and increases the overall compression ratio,\nrtot (when the partial pressure from relativistic particles\ndominates the total pressure of the plasma, rtot \u2192 7).\nSince p = (rtot + 2)/(rtot \u2212 1), a flatter power-law index\nresults (p = 1.5 in the limit that rtot = 7). Second, the\noverall compression ratio can become arbitrarily large as\nthe highest energy particles escape from the shocks (see\nEllison et al. 2004, for further discussion), and in this limit\np \u2192 1.\nSince our modelling suggests that the non-thermal particle acceleration in WR 147 is highly efficient, we have\nexplored fits to the data where p is reduced from its \"standard\" value of 2. With \u03b6rel = \u03b6B and the model parameters\nnoted earlier in this section, better fits to the total flux can\nbe obtained with p = 1.4. The resulting fit (model J) is\nshown in Fig. 16. \u03b6 = 1.4\u00d710\u22122 indicates that the particle\nacceleration is indeed efficient, justifying our adjustment\nof p. A p = 1.4 spectrum corresponds to an overall compression ratio of 8.5 (rtot = (p + 2)/(p \u2212 1)), and is comparable to that achieved in simulations of supernova remnants with highly efficient particle acceleration (Ellison\net al. 2004).

Model J has\n\u03b6B = \u03b6rel = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 , f = 0.17, LOB = 105 L\u2299 and a viewing angle of \u221230\u25e6 . The weighted \u03c72 = 4.97, and the reduced\n\u03c72 = 1.24.

The weighted\n\u03c72 = 5.25, but there is only 2 degrees of freedom and the reduced \u03c72 = 2.63. The open circles (triangles) are synchrotron\nfluxes estimated by subtracting the thermal fluxes in model J\n(model K) from the total observed fluxes. The synchrotron\ndata points are different between models J and K and from\nthose in Figs. 13-14 because of the changes in the thermal flux\nby way of the filling factor.\n\nmodel can be reduced by increasing LOB , while maintaining a similar quality of fit (model K, see Fig. 16), though\nwe again emphasize that the fits to the WR 147 data are\nto the total flux, not to model deduced synchrotron fluxes\nwhich are very uncertain.\nAn important point is that as the overall compression increases (rtot > 4), the subshock compression ratio declines. Since the subshock is responsible for heating the thermal gas, the post-shock temperature drops\nbelow the value expected in the strong-shock ideal-gas\nlimit. Analysis of the X-ray data from WR 147 indicates\nthat the temperature of peak emission from the thermal\ngas is kT \u2248 0.9 keV (Skinner et al. 1999). This can be\ncompared to the theoretical value, kT = 1.96\u03bcv82 keV,\nexpected after thermalization in the strong-shock idealgas limit for material of mean particle mass \u03bcmH flowing\ninto a stationary shock at a typical wind terminal velocity v\u221e = 1000v8 km s\u22121 . As most of the X-ray emission\nshould arise from the shocked WN8 wind (see Pittard &\nStevens 2002), we set \u03bc = 1.17 and v8 = 0.95. The expected temperature is then kT = 2.1 keV. While the contrast is not as large as that seen in WR 140, where the\ntheoretical temperature is 5 times higher than what is observed (Pollock et al. 2005), we nevertheless conclude that\nthere is perhaps some additional support for highly efficient particle acceleration.\n\n\fJ.M. Pittard et al.: Radio emission models of Colliding-Wind Binary Systems\n\n5. Summary and future directions\nWe have extended the work in Paper I by including the\nevolution of the non-thermal electron energy distribution\nin the post-shock flow. IC cooling is by far the most important process to consider, but we have also calculated\nthe degree of ionic cooling for completeness.\nWe have demonstrated that the geometry of the WCR\nand the streamlines of the flow within it lead to a spatially dependent break frequency in the synchrotron emission. We therefore do not observe a single, sharp break in\nthe synchrotron spectrum integrated over the WCR, but\nrather a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum towards\nhigher frequencies.\nAs expected, IC cooling reduces the overall brightness\nof the synchrotron emission from the WCR, but more so\nnear the CD than near the shocks. The synchrotron emission appears brighter at the WR shock than at the O shock\nwhen the O star dominates the luminosity of the system.\nIn this situation, IC cooling has a somewhat lesser effect at\nthe WR shock. Current radio interferometers do not have\nthe spatial resolution and sensitivity needed to detect such\nspatial variation, but the predicted morphology may allow\nfuture observations to determine whether the non-thermal\nelectrons are primarily accelerated at the shocks through\nthe DSA scheme.\nWe find that the observed synchrotron emission may\ndecrease with decreasing Dsep , through a combination of\nIC cooling, free-free absorption, and the Razin effect. This\nis consistent with the non-detection of non-thermal emission from short period CWB systems.\nWe have also investigated how the synchrotron emission varies with the assumed B-field, and have discovered\nthat it is very difficult for SSA to produce high turnover\nfrequencies (>\n\u223c 1 GHz). It is much more likely that the\ncause of these turnovers is free-free absorption through\nthe circumbinary envelope, or the Razin effect. If the optically thin thermal radio emission from the WCR, which\n\u22121\nscales as Dsep\n, becomes comparable to the thermal emission from the unshocked winds, it is possible to obtain a\ncomposite-like spectrum entirely from thermal processes.\nFurthermore, the total free-free emission from CWB\nsystems is likely to vary with binary separation, though\nthe exact nature of the variation depends on the degree\nand distribution of clumping in the system. This has important consequences for deriving mass-loss rates for stars\nin binary systems using radio fluxes, with the implication\nthat they may be significantly over- or under-estimated.\nOur models show that it is preferable to use a high frequency (> 15 GHz) for estimates of mass-loss rates.\nWe have applied our new model to WR 147, and find\nthat the introduction of IC cooling allows a better fit\nto the high frequency data than obtained in Paper I.\nHowever, since a weighted \u03c72 measure is biased by the relatively low uncertainity of the 1.4 and 5 GHz data points,\nany model which fits these points will be preferred, and\nin this respect, the other data points are almost irrelevant\ngiven their relative weights. With the data currently avail-\n\n19\n\nable, we find that the best fits to the 1.4 and 5 GHz fluxes\nare obtained when either the magnetic field energy density\nis substantially less than the non-thermal electron energy\ndensity, or when the injected non-thermal electron spectrum has a power-law index of p = 1.4. We find that we\nrequire efficient electron acceleration in both cases, which\nleads us to favour the model where p = 1.4, since nonlinear calculations of DSA show a hardening of the nonthermal particle spectrum.\nIn summary, our analysis of the radio data from\nWR 147 indicates that efficient particle acceleration occurs in this system, and that the shock structure may\nbe modified by the back-pressure of energetic particles.\nWe emphasize that our current models are in many ways\nvery simplistic, and in order that these conclusions can be\ngiven a firmer footing, more sophisticated models which\nself-consistently include the back-reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock structure need to be developed.\nSuch calculations, unfortunately, are not trivial, and a further complication is that the shock obliquity may change\nwith off-axis distance. As the obliquity increases, the injection rates may reduce, so that some parts of the shocks\nmay be highly modified, while other parts will be unmodified.\nSuch self-consistent models would also be of more general use, because despite the apparent efficiency of DSA,\nX-ray spectra from CWBs have been modelled and interpreted assuming that the shocks place an insignificant\nfraction of their energy into non-thermal particles (e.g.,\nStevens et al. 1996; Zhekov & Skinner 2000; Pittard &\nCorcoran 2002). These works have led to inferences for\nimportant quantities such as the mass-loss rates, wind\nspeeds and composition, and the rate of electron and proton equilibration. However, the strong coupling between\nparticle acceleration and thermal heating implies that the\ninferences made from X-ray observations may differ substantially between interpretations that include particle acceleration self-consistently and those that do not. Future\nwork should address this issue and models should attempt\nto fit radio and X-ray data simultaneously. Finally, to further improve our understanding of particle acceleration in\nWR 147, and other colliding wind binaries, accurate and\nprecise radiometry is required in order to distinguish between models.\nAcknowledgements.

A.3 in terms of \u03b3, we get\n\u03b1\u03bd =\n\nm2e c5\n\u00d7\n8\u03c0h\u03bd 3\nZ\nn(\u03b3 \u2212\n\nh\u03bd\nme c 2 )\n\np1 E1\n\nn(\u03b3)\n\u2212\npE\n\n!\n\nP\u03bd \u03b3\n\np\n\u03b3 2 \u2212 1 d\u03b3. (A.5)\n\nWe evaluate Eq. A.5 to find the SSA for any isotropic\ndistribution of particles n(\u03b3).\n\nReferences\nBell, A.
