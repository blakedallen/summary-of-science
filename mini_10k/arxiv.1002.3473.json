C. Wood at his sixtieth birthday\nAbstract. We present an overview of recent results in locally conformally\nK\u00e4hler geometry, with focus on the topological properties which obstruct the\nexistence of such structures on compact manifolds.\n\n1. Locally conformally K\u00e4hler manifolds\nLocally conformally K\u00e4hler (LCK) geometry is concerned with complex manifolds of complex dimension at least two admitting a K\u00e4hler covering with deck\ntransformations acting by holomorphic homotheties with respect to the K\u00e4hler\nmetric.\nWe shall usually denote with M the LCK manifold, with (J, g) its Hermitian\nstructure, with \u0393 \u2192 M\u0303 \u2192 M the K\u00e4hler covering and with \u03c9\u0303 the K\u00e4hler form on\nthe covering.\nDirectly from the definition, one obtains the existence of an associated character\n\u03c7 : \u0393 \u2192 R>0 ,\n\n\u03c7(\u03b3) =\n\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u03c9\u0303\n.\n\u03c9\u0303\n\nThis already puts some restrictions on \u03c01 (M ). Others, more precise ones, will\nbe obtained further.\nSometimes, the couple (\u0393, M\u0303 ) is called a presentation of the LCK manifold M .\nHere, M\u0303 is understood as a K\u00e4hler manifold tgether with a group of holomorphic\nhomotheties (called a homothetic K\u00e4hler manifold). The idea is that, as on M the\nmetric can move in a conformal class, on the covering, the K\u00e4hler metric is not\nfixed but can be changed homothetically. Obviously, the same LCK manifold can\nadmit many presentations and one can choose a minimal one and a maximal one\n(corresponding to the simply connected M\u0303 ). However, the rank of the image of \u0393 in\nR>0 is constant; it will be denoted rk(M ). Clearly, rk(M ) 6 b1 (M ) (see [GOPP]).\nAn equivalent definition - historically, the first one -, at the level of the manifold\nitself, requires the existence of an open covering {U\u03b1 } with local K\u00e4hler metrics\ng\u03b1 subject to the condition that on overlaps U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 , these local K\u00e4hler metrics\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 53C55.\nL.O. is partially supported by a CNCSIS PNII IDEI Grant nr. 529/2009.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLIVIU ORNEA AND MISHA VERBITSKY\n\nare homothetic: g\u03b1 = c\u03b1\u03b2 g\u03b2 . The cocycle {cUV } is represented by a closed one-\n\nform \u03b8. Locally, \u03b8 U\u03b1 = df\u03b1 and the metrics ef\u03b1 g\u03b1 glue to a global metric whose\nassociated two-form \u03c9 satisfies the integrability condition d\u03c9 = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03c9, thus being\nlocally conformal with the K\u00e4hler metrics g\u03b1 . Here \u03b8 is a closed 1-form on M , called\nthe Lee form. This gives another definition of an LCK structure (motivating also\nthe name), which will be used in this paper.\nDefinition 1.1. Let (M, \u03c9) be a Hermitian manifold, dimC M > 1, with d\u03c9 = \u03b8\u2227\u03c9,\nwhere \u03b8 is a closed 1-form. Then M is called a locally conformally K\u00e4hler (LCK)\nmanifold.\nRemark 1.2. i) Some authors include the K\u00e4hler manifolds as particular LCK\nmanifolds. Although this is a legitimate choice, we prefer the dichotomy LCK versus K\u00e4hler, and hence we always assume that the LCK manifolds we work with\nare of non-K\u00e4hler type. Due to a result in [Va], namely: A compact locally conformally K\u00e4hler manifold which admits some K\u00e4hler metric, or, more generally,\nwhich satisfies the \u2202\u2202-Lemma, is globally conformally K\u00e4hler, it is enough to assume [\u03b8] 6= 0 \u2208 H 1 (M, R).\nii) The equation d\u03c9 = \u03b8 \u2227\u03c9 makes sense also in absence of a complex structure,\nleading to the notion of locally conformally symplectic manifold (LCS). There\nis a great number of papers on this topic, among the authors of which we cite: A.\nBanyaga, G. Bande, S. Haller, D. Kotschick, A. Lichnerowicz, J.C. Marrero, I. Vaisman etc. Hence, any LCK structure underlies a LCS structure. Nothing is known\non the converse. The corresponding question regarding the relation symplectic versus K\u00e4hler was since long solved by Thurston, [Th]. We still do not know if any\n(compact) LCS manifold admits an integrable, compatible complex structure which\nmakes it a LCK manifold or not. The difficulty might come from the fact that the\ntopology of a LCK manifold is not controlled. We believe the answer should be\nnegative and hence we propose:\nOpen Problem 1. Construct a compact LCS manifold which admits no LCK\nmetric.\nThe Lee form, which is the torsion of the Chern connection (see [G]), can also\nbe interpreted in terms of presentations as follows. Abelianize the Serre sequence\nof \u0393 \u2192 M\u0303 \u2192 M to get:\nH1 (K, Z) \u2192 H1 (M, Z) \u2192 \u0393ab \u2192 1.\n\nThen apply Hom(*, Z) to obtain:\n0 \u2192 Hom(\u0393ab , Z) \u2192 H 1 (M, Z) \u2192 H 1 (K, Z).\nTensoring with \u2297Z R, exactness is conserved (as R/Z is flat) and one arrives at:\ni\n\n1\n1\n0 \u2192 HomZ (\u0393ab , R) \u2192 HDR\n(M ) \u2192 HDR\n(K).\n\nThen i(\u03c7) = [\u03b8], as proven in [PV].\nWe refer to [DO] and [O] for an overview of this geometry. Here we focus on\nour recent results and on related ones.\nThe following notion, coming from conformal geometry, is crucial for the way\nwe understand LCK geometry:\n\n\fLOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\nDefinition 1.3. Let (M, \u03c9, \u03b8) be an LCK manifold, and L the trivial line bundle,\n1\nassociated to the representation GL(2n, R) \u220b A 7\u2192 | det A| n , with flat connection\ndefined as D := d + \u03b8. Then L is called the weight bundle of M .\nIts holonomy coincides with the character \u03c7 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2212\u2192 R>0 whose image is\ncalled the monodromy group of M .\nWe shall denote with the same letter, D, the corresponding covariant derivative\non M . It is precisely the Weyl covariant derivative associated to \u2207 = \u2207g and \u03b8,\nuniquely defined by the conditions:\nDJ = 0,\n\nDg = \u03b8 \u2297 g.\n\nThe complexified weight bundle will also be denoted L. As d\u03b8 = 0, L is flat\nand defines a local system and hence one can compute its cohomology.\nOn the other hand, in LCK geometry, one tries to work on the K\u00e4hler covering.\nBut there, the interesting tensorial objects, in particular differential forms \u03b1, are the\nones satisfying: \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03c7(\u03b3)\u03b1 for every \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393. We call such forms automorphic.\nThe advantage of using the weight bundle is that automorphic objects on M\u0303\nare regarded as objects on M with values in L.\n1.1. Examples.\n1.1.1. Diagonal Hopf manifolds. ([GO], [KO], [Ve].) Let HA := (Cn \\{0})/hAi\nwith A = diag(\u03b1i ) endowed with:\n\u2022 Complex structure as the projection of the standard one of Cn .\n\u2022 LCK metric constructed as follows:\nLet C > 1 be a constant and\nX\n\u03c6(z1 , . . . , zn ) =\n|zi |\u03b2i , \u03b2i = log|\u03b1i |\u22121 C\n\na potential on Cn .\n\u221a\nThen A\u2217 \u03c6 = C \u22121 \u03c6 and hence: \u03a9 = \u22121\u2202\u2202\u03c6 is K\u00e4hler and \u0393 \u223c\n=Z\nacts by holomorphic homotheties with respect to it.\nX\nNote that the Lee field: \u03b8\u266f = \u2212\nzi log |\u03b1i |\u2202zi is parallel.\nIt is also important to observe that the LCK metric here is constructed out of\nan automorphic potential. The construction will be extended to non-diagonal Hopf\nmanifolds.\n1.1.2. Compact complex surfaces. Belgun, [Be], gave the complete list of compact complex surfaces which admit metrics with parallel Lee form (\u2207\u03b8 = 0), being,\nin particular, LCK. Such metrics are called Vaisman and will be treated separately,\nin section 2.1 (see Theorems 2.6, 2.7).\nRecently, Fujiki and Pontecorvo constructed LCK metrics on parabolic and\nhyperbolic Inoue surfaces. These examples are also bihermitian and hence related\nto generalized K\u00e4hler geometry. We also note that in [AD], the LCK metric of\nthe diagonal Hopf surface gGO found [GO] was deformed to a family of bihermitian\nmetrics (gt , J, J t ) with J t = \u03c6 t (J), where \u03c6t is a path of diffeomorphisms; as t \u2192 0,\nJ t \u2192 J and gt /t \u2192 gGO .\nMore generally, Brunella, [Br2], proved that all surfaces with global spherical shells, also known as Kato surfaces (as the previous mentioned parabolic and\nhyperbolic Inoue surfaces are) do admit LCK metrics. Previously he constructed\nfamilies of LCK metrics only on Enoki surfaces, [Br1].\n\n\f4\n\nLIVIU ORNEA AND MISHA VERBITSKY\n\nOn the other hand, Belgun also proved in [Be] that a certain type of Inoue\nsurfaces does not admit any LCK metric. As these surfaces are deformations of\nother Inoue surfaces with LCK metric (found in [Tr]), this proves, in particular,\nthat, unlike the K\u00e4hler class, the LCK class is not stable at small deformations.\nBy contrast, the LCK class share with the K\u00e4hler one the stability to blowing up\npoints, [Tr], [Vu1].\n1.1.3. Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds, [OT]. Let K be an algebraic number field\nof degree n := (K : Q). Let then \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3s (resp. \u03c3s+1 , . . . , \u03c3n ) be the real (resp.\ncomplex) embeddings of K into C, with \u03c3s+i = \u03c3 s+i+t , for 1 6 i 6 t. Let OK be\nthe ring of algebraic integers of K. Note that for any s, t \u2208 N, there exist algebraic\nnumber fields with precisely s real and 2t complex embeddings.\nUsing the embeddings \u03c3i , K can be embedded in Cm , m = s + t, by\n\u03c3 : K \u2192 Cm ,\n\n\u03c3(a) = (\u03c31 (a), . . . , \u03c3m (a)).\n\nThis embedding extends to OK and \u03c3(OK ) is a lattice of rank n in Cm . This gives\nrise to a properly discontinuous action of OK on Cm . On the other hand, K itself\nacts on Cm by\n(a, z) 7\u2192 (\u03c31 (a)z1 , . . . , \u03c3m (a)zm ).\n\n\u2217\nNote that if a \u2208 OK , a\u03c3(OK ) \u2286 \u03c3(OK ). Let now OK\nbe the group of units in OK\nand set\n\u2217,+\n\u2217\n| \u03c3i (a) > 0, 1 6 i 6 s}.\nOK\n= {a \u2208 OK\n\n\u2217\nThe only torsion elements in the ring OK\nare \u00b11, hence the Dirichlet units theorem\n\u2217\nasserts the existence of a free Abelian group G of rank m \u2212 1 such that OK\n=\n\u2217,+\nG \u222a (\u2212G). Choose G in such a away that it contains OK (with finite index). Now\n\u2217,+\nOK\nacts multiplicatively on Cm and, taking into account also the above additive\n\u2217,+\n\u2217\naction, one obtains a free action of the semi-direct product OK\n\u22c9 OK\non Cm\nwhich leaves invariant H s \u00d7 Ct (as above, H is the open upper half-plane in C).\n\u2217,+\nThe authors then show that it is possible to choose a subgroup U of OK\nsuch that\nthe action of U \u22c9 OK on H s \u00d7 Ct be properly discontinuous and co-compact. Such\na subgroup U is called admissible for K. The quotient\n\nX(K, U ) := (H s \u00d7 Ct )/(U \u22c9 OK )\nis then shown to be a m-dimensional compact complex (affine) manifold, differentiably a fiber bundle over (S 1 )s with fiber (S 1 )n .\nFor t = 1, X(K, U ) admits LCK metrics.\nIndeed,\ns\nY\ni\n+ |zm |2\n\u03c6 : H s \u00d7 C \u2192 R, \u03c6 =\nz\n\u2212\nz\nj\nj\nj=1\nis a K\u00e4hler potential on whose associated 2-form i\u2202\u2202\u03c6 the deck group acts by linear\nholomorphic homotheties. On the other hand, one sees that the potential itself is\nnot automorphic (in particular, these manifolds cannot be Vaisman, see \u00a72.1).\nA particular class of manifolds X(K, U ) is that of simple type, when U is not\ncontained in Z and its action on OK does not admit a proper non-trivial invariant submodule of lower rank (which, as the authors show, is equivalent to the\nassumption that there is no proper intermediate field extension Q \u2282 K \u2032 \u2282 K with\nU \u2282 OK \u2032 ). If X(K, U ) is of simple type, then b1 (X(K, U )) = s (a more direct proof\n\n\fLOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n5\n\n\u0012 \u0013\ns\n. Moreover, the tan2\ngent bundle T X(K, U ) is flat and dim H 1 (X(K, U ), OX(K,U) ) > s. In particular,\nX(K, U ) are non-K\u00e4hler.\n\u2217,+\nObserve that for s = t = 1 and U = OK\n, X(K, U ) reduces to an Inoue surface\nSM with the metric given in [Tr].\nNow, for s = 2 and t = 1, the six-dimensional X(K, U ) is of simple type, hence\nhas the following Betti numbers: b0 = b6 = 1, b1 = b5 = 2, b2 = b4 = 1, b3 = 0.\nThis disproves Vaisman's conjecture claiming that a compact LCK, non-K\u00e4hler,\nmanifold must have an odd odd Betti number.\nThese manifolds can be used to obtain examples of LCK structures with arbitrary rank (recall that rk(M ) is the rank of \u03c7(\u0393) in R>0 ).

[OV7] (M, J, g) is a LCK manifold with (automorphic) potential\nif M admits a K\u00e4hler covering with automorphic potential.\nRemark 2.2. The definition we gave in [OV3] was slightly more restrictive: we\nasked the potential to be a proper function (i.e. to have compact levels). The\nproperness of the potential is equivalent to the weight bundle having monodromy\nZ. Later on, we proved in [OV6] that on any compact LCK manifold with automorphic potential, there exists another LCK metric with automorphic potential and\nmonodromy Z. The proof amounts to a deformation of the weight bundle together\nwith its connection form.\nHowever, we have strong reasons to believe that the deformation is not necessary:\nConjecture 1. Any compact LCK manifold with automorphic potential has monodromy Z.\nThe existence of a potential for the K\u00e4hler metric of the covering can be shown\nto be equivalent with the equation (\u2207\u03b8)1,1 = 0, introduced in [K] under the name\nof pluricanonical K\u00e4hler-Weyl and studied also in [KK].\nProposition 2.1. [OV7] M admits a K\u00e4hler covering with automorphic potential\nif and only if (\u2207\u03b8)1,1 = 0.\nFor the proof, one first proves by direct computation that (\u2207\u03b8)1,1 = 0 is equivalent with the equation:\nd(J\u03b8) = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2227 J\u03b8.\n\n\f6\n\nLIVIU ORNEA AND MISHA VERBITSKY\n\nThis can also be put in terms of Weyl connection as:\n1\n(D\u03b8)1,1 = (\u03b8 \u2297 \u03b8)1,1 \u2212 g.\n2\nNow, let M\u0303 be a covering of M on which the pull-back of \u03b8 is exact. Denote, for\nconvenience, with the same letters the pull-backs to M\u0303 of \u03b8, \u03c9 and D. As locally\nD is the Levi-Civita connection of the local K\u00e4hler metrics, its pull-back on M\u0303 is\nthe Levi-Civita connection of the K\u00e4hler metric on M\u0303 globally conformal with \u03c9.\nThen let \u03c8 := e\u2212\u03bd , where d\u03bd = \u03b8. We have\nddc \u03c8 = \u2212e\u2212\u03bd ddc \u03bd + e\u2212\u03bd d\u03bd \u2227 dc \u03bd = e\u2212\u03bd (dc \u03b8 + \u03b8 \u2227 J\u03b8) = \u03c8\u03c9,\n\nand hence the pluricanonical condition implies that \u03c8 is an automorphic potential\nfor the K\u00e4hler metric \u03c8\u03c9. The converse is true by a similar argument.\nA second characterization can be given in terms of Bott-Chern cohomology.\n\u221e\nLet \u039b1,1\n\u03c7,d (M\u0303 ) be the space of closed, automorphic (1, 1)-forms on M\u0303 , and C\u03c7 (M\u0303 )\nthe space of automorphic functions on M\u0303 . Then\n1,1\nHBC\n(M, L) :=\n\n\u039b1,1\n\u03c7,d (M\u0303 )\nddc (C\u03c7\u221e (M\u0303 ))\n\nis the Bott-Chern group of the LCK manifold (it is finite-dimensional and does\nnot depend on the choice of the presentation). It is now clear that\n1,1\nLemma 2.3. [OV6] M is LCK with potential if [\u03a9] = 0 \u2208 HBC\n(M, L).\n\nThe main properties of LCK manifolds with automorphic potential are listed\nin the following:\nTheorem 2.4. [OV3] i) The class of compact LCK manifolds with potential is\nstable to small deformations.\nii) Compact LCK manifolds with potential, of complex dimension at least 3,\ncan be holomorphically embedded in a (non-diagonal), Hopf manifold.\nFrom i), it follows that the Hopf manifold (CN \\ 0)/\u0393, with \u0393 cyclic, generated\nby a non-diagonal linear operator, is LCK with potential. This is the appropriate\ngeneralization of the (non\u2013Vaisman) non-diagonal Hopf surface. Then ii) says that\nthe Hopf manifold plays in LCK geometry the r\u00f4le of the projective space in K\u00e4hler\ngeometry.\n2.1. Vaisman manifolds. Among the LCK manifolds with potential, a most\ninteresting class is the Vaisman one. A Vaisman metric is a Hermitian metric with\nparallel Lee form. It can be easily seen that the K\u00e4hler metric of the covering has\nglobal automorphic potential \u03c6 = \u03c9\u0303(\u03c0 \u2217 \u03b8, \u03c0 \u2217 \u03b8).\nThe Lee field of a Vaisman manifold is Killing and, being parallel, it has constant length. Conversely, a LCK metric with Killing Lee field of constant length\nis Vaisman (see, e.g. [DO, Proposition 4.2]). On the other hand, it was proven in\n[Ve, Proposition 6.5] that a complex compact submanifold of a compact Vaisman\nmanifold must be tangent to the Lee field. In particular, the submanifold enherits\na LCK metric whose Lee field is again Killing and of constant length. Hence:\nProposition 2.2. Complex compact submanifolds of a compact Vaisman manifold\nare again Vaisman.\n\n\fLOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n7\n\nAs the LCK metric of the diagonal Hopf manifold is Vaisman, this provides a\nwide class of examples. On the other hand, on surfaces there exists the complete\nlist of compact examples, see above.\nOn Vaisman manifolds, the vector field \u03b8\u266f is holomorphic and Killing, and hence\nit generates a totally geodesic, Riemannian, holomorphic foliation F . When this\nis quasi-regular, one may consider the leaf space and obtain a fibration in elliptic\ncurves over a K\u00e4hler orbifold. Similarly, when \u03b8\u266f has compact orbits, the leaf space\nis a Sasakian orbifold, [Bl], over which M fibers in circles. The two principal\nfibrations are connected by the Boothby-Wang fibration in a commutative diagram\nwhose model is the classical Hopf fibering:\n\nw\nS www\nw\nw\nw\n{w\nw\n1\n\nM/<\u03b8>\n\nSasakian orbifold\n\nM II\nII TC1\nII\nII\nI$\n/ M/<\u03b8,J\u03b8>\n1\nS\n\nK\u00e4hler orbifold\n\nS 1 \u00d7 S 2n+1\nLLL\nqqq\nLLL\nq\nq\nq\nLLL\nq\nq\nL&\nxqq\n/ CP n\nS 2n+1\n\u03b8=dt=length element of S 1\n\nThis is, in fact, the generic situation, because we proved in [OV2] that the\nVaisman structure of a compact manifold can always be deformed to a quasi-regular\none.\nFrom the above, it is clear that Vaisman structures may exist on the total space\nof some elliptic fibrations on compact K\u00e4hler manifolds. The precise statement is:\nTheorem 2.5. [Vu2] Let X, B be compact complex manifolds, X \u2192 B an elliptic principal bundle with fiber E. If the Chern classes of this bundle are linearly\nindependent in H 2 (B, R), then X carries no locally conformally K\u00e4hler structure.\nThis contrasts with the case of an induced Hopf fibration over a projective\nmanifold B, when one of the Chern classes vanishes.\nFor surfaces, we have a complete list of those who admit Vaisman metrics:\nTheorem 2.6. [Be] Let M be a compact complex surface with odd b1 . Then M\nadmits a Vaisman metric if and only if M is an elliptic surface (a properly elliptic\nsurface, a - primary or secondary - Kodaira surface, or an elliptic Hopf surface) or\na diagonal Hopf surface.\nUsing the \"if\" part of this result we can prove:\nTheorem 2.7. Let be a minimal, non-K\u00e4hler compact surface, which is not of\nclass VII. Then M is a Vaisman elliptic surface.\nIndeed, recall that a compact complex surface surface is called class VII if\nit has Kodaira dimension \u2212\u221e and b1 (M ) = 1. It is called minimal if it has\nno rational curves with self-intersection \u22121. Now, from Kodaira's classification of\nsurfaces, it follows that the algebraic dimension of M is 1 (see e.g. [T, Theorem\n5]). Also from Kodaira's classification it follows that M is elliptic [T, Theorem 3].\nOn the other hand, a non-K\u00e4hler compact complex surface has odd b1 ([Bu] and\n[L]) It only remains to apply Belgun's result.\nThe transversal K\u00e4hlerian foliation F permits the use of transversal foliations\ntechniques (basic operators etc.) The following result concerning unicity of Vaisman\nstructures was obtained this way:\n\n\f8\n\nLIVIU ORNEA AND MISHA VERBITSKY\n\nTheorem 2.8. [OV5] Let (M, J) be a compact complex manifold admitting a Vaisman structure, and V \u2208 \u039bn,n (M ) a nowhere degenerate, positive volume form.\nThen M admits at most one Vaisman structure with the same Lee class, such that\nthe volume form of the corresponding Gauduchon metric is equal to V .\nAnother recent application of this technique is the following:\nTheorem 2.9. [OP] Let (M 2m , g, J) be a compact Vaisman manifold. The metric\ng is geometrically formal (i.e. the product of every harmonic forms is again harmonic) if and only if bp (M ) = 0 for 2 6 p 6 2m \u2212 2 and b1 (M ) = b2m\u22121 (M ) = 1,\nhence M has the real homology of a Hopf manifold.\nThe connection between Vaisman and Sasakian geometries is clearly seen in:\nTheorem 2.10. [OV1] Compact Vaisman manifolds are mapping tori over S 1\nwith Sasakian fibre. More precisely: the universal cover M\u0303 is a metric cone N \u00d7\nR>0 , with N compact Sasakian manifold and the deck group is isomorphic with Z,\ngenerated by (x, t) 7\u2192 (\u03bb(x), t + q) for some \u03bb \u2208 Aut(N ), q \u2208 R>0 .\nThis result was recently used to prove the following:\nTheorem 2.11. [MO] On compact Vaisman manifolds whose Weyl connection\ndoes not have holonomy in Sp(n) and which are not diagonal Hopf manifolds,\nconf(M, [g]) = aut(M ).\nIndeed, the statement follows from the fact that Killing fields with respect\nto the Gauduchon metric (and a Vaisman metric is Gauduchon) are holomorphic,\n[MO], and from the more general, referring to Riemannian cones:\nTheorem 2.12. [MO] Let (M, g) := (W, h)\u00d7R/{(x,t)\u223c(\u03c8(x),t+1)}, with \u03c8 \u2208 Iso(W, h),\nW compact. Then conformal vector fields on (M, g) are Killing.\nFor Vaisman manifolds, the conclusion of ii) in Theorem 2.4 can be sharpened:\nTheorem 2.13. [OV3] A compact complex manifold of dimension of least 3 admits\na Vaisman metric if and only if it admits a holomorphic embedding into a diagonal\nHopf manifold.\nTaking into account also the relation between Sasaki and Vaisman geometries,\na first application of this Kodaira-Nakano type theorem was a corresponding embedding result in Sasakian geometry:\nTheorem 2.14. [OV4] A compact Sasakian manifold M admits a CR-embedding into a Sasakian manifold diffeomorphic to a sphere, and this embedding is\ncompatible with the respective Reeb fields.\nMoreover, we showed that this is the best result one may hope: assuming the\nexistence of a model manifold in Sasakian geometry, analogue of the projective\nspace in complex geometry, leads to a contradiction. A key point in the proof of\nthe theorem was showing that if Z is a closed complex submanifold of a compact\nK\u00e4hler manifold (M, \u03c9), [\u03c9] \u2208 H 2 (M ) is the K\u00e4hler class of M , and \u03c90 is a K\u00e4hler\nform on Z such that its K\u00e4hler class coincides with the restriction [\u03c9]|Z , then there\nexists a K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 \u2208 [\u03c9] on M such that \u03c9|Z = \u03c90 . Recently, using a same\ntype of argument, van Coevering gave a more direct proof of the embedding in [C].\nWe also used Theorem 2.13 to prove that, diffeomorphically, LCK with automorphic potential and Vaisman manifolds are the same:\n\n\fLOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n9\n\nTheorem 2.15. [OV7] Let (M, \u03c9, \u03b8) be an LCK manifold with potential with complex dimension at least 3. Then there exists a deformation of M which admits a\nVaisman metric.\nFor the proof, one considers a holomorphic embedding of M in a Hopf manifold\nH = (CN \\ {0})hAi, then observes that M corresponds to a complex subvariety Z\nof CN , smooth outside of {0} and fixed by A. The operator A admits a JordanChevalley decomposition A := SU , with S diagonal and U unipotent and one can\nshow that S preserves Z. Then M1 := (Z \\ {0})/hSi is a deformation of M (as\nS is contained in a GL(Cn )-orbit of A) and is Vaisman as contained in the Hopf\nmanifold HS := (Cn \\ {0})/hSi.\nThe above result shows that all known topological obstructions to the existence\nof a Vaisman metric on a compact complex manifold (see e.g. [DO]) apply to LCK\nmanifolds with potential. It allows, in particular, to determine the fundamental\ngroup of compact LCK manifolds with potential. Indeed, one first deforms the\nstructure to a Vaisman one, then deforms this one to a quasi-regular one (see\nabove) which fibers in elliptic curves over a K\u00e4hler basis X. At this point, one\nconsiders the homotopy sequence of the fibering:\n\u03b4\n\n\u03c02 (X) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (T 2 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (X) \u2212\u2192 0\n\nand observes that rk(Im(\u03b4)) 6 1 in \u03c01 (T 2 ), as the Chern classes of the S 1 \u00d7 S 1 fibration are: one trivial (as M fibers on S 1 ), the other one non-trivial, as M is\nnon-K\u00e4hler, and the total space of an elliptic fibration with trivial Chern classes is\nK\u00e4hler. Hence:\nCorollary 2.1. [OV7] The fundamental group of a compact LCK manifold M with\nan automorphic potential admits an exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (X) \u2212\u2192 0\n\nwhere \u03c01 (X) is the fundamental group of a K\u00e4hler orbifold, and G is a quotient of\nZ2 by a subgroup of rank 1.\nRemark 2.16. In fact, in [OV7] we only proved that the rank of the subgroup\nmust be 6 1, but the recent Theorem 2.5 above ([Vu2]) shows that rk(M ) = 0\nwould imply M is K\u00e4hler (see also Remark 1.2).\nCorollary 2.2. [OV7] A non-Abelian free group cannot be the fundamental group\nof a compact LCK manifold with potential.\nThis corollary, as well as other topological restrictions, was first obtained by\nKokarev and Kotschick using harmonic forms and a LCK version of Siu-Beauville\nresult:\nTheorem 2.17. [KK] Let M be a closed complex manifold admitting a LCK structure with potential (pluricanonical K\u00e4hler-Weyl). Then the following statements are\nequivalent:\ni) M admits a surjective holomorphic map with connected fibers to a closed\nRiemann surface of genus > 2;\nii) \u03c01 (M ) admits a surjective homomorphism to the fundamental group of a\nclosed Riemann surface of genus > 2;\niii) \u03c01 (M ) admits a surjective homomorphism to a non-Abelian free group.\nThe above can be generalized to:\n\n\f10\n\nLIVIU ORNEA AND MISHA VERBITSKY\n\nTheorem 2.18. [KK] Let M be a closed complex manifold admitting a LCK structure with potential, and N a closed Riemannian manifold of constant negative curvature. If \u03c6 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u03c01 (N ) is a representation with non-cyclic image, then\nthere exists a compact Riemann surface S and a holomorphic map h : M \u2192 S with\nconnected fibers such that \u03c6 factors through h\u2217 .\nIn particular, if N is a closed real hyperbolic manifold, dim N > 4, then any\nmap f : M \u2192 N has degree zero.\nOther topological obstructions to the existence of a LCK structure with potential were obtained by Kokarev in [K] using harmonic maps techniques. For\nexample, one of his results is:\nTheorem 2.19. [K] Let M be a compact LCK manifold of the same homotopy\ntype as a locally Hermitian symmetric space of non-compact type whose universal\ncover does not contain the hyperbolic plane as a factor. If M admits a LCK metric\nwith potential, then it admits a global K\u00e4hler metric.\nOn the other hand, on compact Vaisman manifolds the cohomology of L (which\nis the Morse-Novikov cohomology of the operator d \u2212 \u03b8\u2227) is simple: H \u2217 (M, L\u03b8 ) = 0\nfollows easily from the Structure theorem 2.10 (here the subscript \u03b8 makes precise\nthe structure of local system of L).\nTheorem 2.20. [OV6] Let (M J) be a compact complex manifold, of complex\ndimension at least 3, endowed with a Vaisman structure with 2-form \u03c9 and Lee\nform \u03b8. Let \u03c91 be another LCK-form (not necessarily Vaisman) on (M J), and\nlet \u03b81 be its Lee form. Then \u03b81 is cohomologous with the Lee form of a Vaisman\nmetric, and [\u03c91 ] = 0 \u2208 H 2 (M, L\u03b81 ).\nBy contrast, on an Inoue surface, which does not admit any Vaisman metric,\nthere exists a LCK metric, compatible with the solvmanifold structure, with nonvanishing Morse-Novikov class of the LCK two-form, [Ba].\nWe end this section with a result which determines all compact nilmanifolds admitting an invariant LCK structure (generalizing a result of L. Ugarte in dimension\n4):\nTheorem 2.21. [S] Let (M, J) be a non-toral compact nilmanifold with a leftinvariant complex structure. If (M, J) has a locally conformally K\u00e4hler structure,\nthen (M, J) is biholomorphic to a quotient of (H(n) \u00d7 R, J0 ), where H(n) is the\ngeneralized Heisenberg group and J0 is the natural complex structure on the product.\nThe author mentions that he does not know if the biholomorphism he finds\npasses to the quotient; in other words, he does not know if the compact LCK\nnilmanifold is isomorphic or biholomorphic with H(n) \u00d7 S 1 . On the other hand,\none sees that, in particular, left invariant LCK structures on compact nilmanifolds\nare of Vaisman type. We tend to believe that the result is true in more general\nsetting, namely without the assumption of left (or right) invariance. It is tempting\nto state:\nConjecture 2. Every LCK compact nilmanifod is, up to covering, the product of\nthe generalized Heisenberg group with S 1 .\n\n\fLOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n11\n\n3. Transformation groups of LCK manifolds\nThe study of this topic went in two directions. The first one is characterizing\nthe various groups appearing in LCK geometry (conformalities, isometries, affinities with respect to the Levi-Civita or the Weyl connection, holomorphicities) and\ndetermination of their interrelations. The second one is characterizing different\nsubclasses of LCK manifolds by the existence of a particular subgroup of one of\nthese groups.\nIn the first direction, we mention the above Theorem 2.11 and the following\nlocal result:\nTheorem 3.1. [MO] On any LCK manifold, aff(M, \u2207) = aut(M ), provided that\nHol0 (D) is irreducible and Hol0 (D) is not contained in Sp(n).\nFor the proof, one first shows that aff(M, \u2207) \u2286 h(M, J) (thus generalizing the\nanalogue result for K\u00e4hler manifolds). Indeed, let f \u2208 Aff(M, D). We show that it\nis \u00b1 - holomorphic.\nDefine Jx\u2032 := (dx f )\u22121 \u25e6 Jf (x) \u25e6 (dx f ). Then J \u2032 is D-parallel. To show that\nJ \u2032 = \u00b1J, we decompose JJ \u2032 = S (symm.) + A (antisymm.). Then S is \u2207-parallel\nand hence it has constant eigenvalues; thus the corresponding eigenbundles are\nD-parallel.\nBy Hol0 (D) irreducible, S = k id, k \u2208 R. Similarly, A2 = p id, p \u2208 R.\nNow, if A 6= 0, then A(X) 6= 0 for some X \u2208 T M\u221a\n, so 0 > \u2212g(AX, AX) =\ng(A2 X, X) = pg(X, X), whence p < 0. Then K := A/ \u2212p is D-parallel, K 2 =\n\u2212 id, KJ = \u2212JK, so (J, K) defines a D-parallel quaternionic structure structure\non M , contradiction.\n2\nHence A = 0, JJ \u2032 = k id, so J \u2032 = \u2212kJ. But J \u2032 = \u2212 id, thus k = \u00b11 and so\nJ \u2032 = \u00b1J.\nWith similar arguments one proves that aff(M, D) \u2286 conf(M, [g]).\nIn the second direction, we first recall the following characterization of Vaisman\nmanifolds:\nTheorem 3.2. [KO] A compact LCK manifold admits a LCK metric with parallel Lee form if its Lie group of holomorphic conformalities has a complex onedimensional Lie subgroup, acting non-isometrically on its K\u00e4hler covering.\nWe note that the above criterion assures the existence of a Vaisman metric\nin the conformal class of the given LCK one. We recently extended this result to\nobtain the existence of a LCK metric with automorphic potential, not necessarily\nconformal to the starting LCK one:\nTheorem 3.3. [OV8] Let M be a compact LCK manifold, equipped with a holomorphic S 1 -action. Suppose that the holonomy of the weight bundle L restricted to\na general orbit of this S 1 -action is non-trivial. Then M\u0303 admits a global automorphic\npotential.\nFor the proof, a first step is to show that one can assume from the beginning\nthat \u03c9, and hence, as J remains unchanged, g, is S 1 -invariant (i.e. the action is\nisometric). Note that a similar argument was used in the proof of Theorem 2.20.\nIndeed, we average \u03b8 on S 1 and obtain \u03b8\u2032 = \u03b8 + df which is S 1 -invariant. The\ncohomology class is conserved: [\u03b8] = [\u03b8\u2032 ]. Now we let \u03c9 \u2032 = e\u2212f \u03c9: it is LCK,\nconformal to \u03c9 and with Lee form \u03b8\u2032 .\n\n\f12\n\nLIVIU ORNEA AND MISHA VERBITSKY\n\nHence, we may assume from the beginning that \u03b8 (corresponding to \u03c9) is S 1 invariant.\nWe now average \u03c9 over S 1 , taking into account that:\n(3.1)\n\nd(a\u2217 \u03c9) = a\u2217 \u03c9 \u2227 a\u2217 \u03b8 = a\u2217 \u03c9 \u2227 \u03b8,\n\nWe thus find an \u03c9 \u2032 which is S 1 -invariant, with\n\na \u2208 S1.\n\nd\u03c9 \u2032 = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03c9 \u2032 .\n\nR\nAs the monodromy of L along an orbit S of the S 1 -action is precisely S \u03b8, it\nis not changed by this averaging procedure.\nThis means that it is enough to make the proof assuming \u03c9 is S 1 -invariant.\nOn the other hand, the lift of S 1 to M\u0303 acts on \u03c9\u0303 by homotheties, and the\ncorresponding conformal constant is equal to the monodromy of L along the orbits\nof S 1 . Thus, the image of the restriction of the character \u03c7 to the lifted subgroup\ncannot be compact in R>0 unless it is trivial, hence the S 1 action lifts to an R\naction.\nIn conclusion, we may assume from the beginning that S 1 is lifted to an R\nacting on M\u0303 by non-trivial homotheties.\nNow, let A be the vector field on M\u0303 generated by the R-action.
