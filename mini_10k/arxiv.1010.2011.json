From optical observations\nof the massive stars, reddening E(B \u2212 V ) and distance to the cluster are estimated to be 0.76 - 1.00 mag and 6.0 \u00b1 0.8 kpc, respectively. Present analysis\nyields a spectral class of O6.5V for the main ionizing source of the region and\nthe maximum post-main-sequence age of the cluster is estimated as \u223c 4 Myr.\nDetailed physical properties of the young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region\nare analyzed using a combination of optical/NIR colour-colour and colourmagnitude diagrams. The distribution of YSOs in (J \u2212 H)/(H \u2212 K) NIR\ncolour-colour diagram shows that a majority of them have AV 6 4 mag. However, a few YSOs show AV values higher than 4 mag. Based on the NIR excess\ncharacteristics, we identified 120 probable candidate YSOs in this region which\nyield a disk frequency of \u223c 20%. However, this should be considered as a lower\nlimit. These YSOs are found to have an age spread of \u223c 5 Myr with a median\nage of \u223c 2-3 Myr and a mass range of \u223c 0.1 - 3.0 M\u2299 . A significant number of\n\n\f2\n\nJose et al.\nYSOs are located close to the cluster centre and we detect an enhanced density\nof reddened YSOs located/projected close to the molecular clumps detected\nby Deharveng et al. (2008) at the periphery of NGC 1624. This indicates that\nthe YSOs located within the cluster core are relatively older in comparison\nto those located/projected near the clumps. From the radio continuum flux,\nspectral class of the ionizing source of the ultra-compact H ii (UC H ii ) region at the periphery of Sh2-212 is estimated to be \u223c B0.5V. From optical\ndata, slope of the mass function (MF) \u0393, in the mass range 1.2 6 M/M\u2299 < 27\ncan be represented by a single power law with a slope -1.18 \u00b1 0.10, whereas\nthe NIR data in the mass range 0.65 6 M/M\u2299 < 27 yields \u0393 = -1.31 \u00b1 0.15.\nThus the MF agrees fairly with the Salpeter value. The slope of the K-band\nluminosity function (KLF) for the cluster is found to be 0.30 \u00b1 0.06 which is\nin agreement with the values obtained for other young clusters.\nKey words:\nstars: formation \u2212 stars: luminosity function, mass function \u2212 stars: pre\u2212main\u2212sequence\n\u2212 open clusters and associations: individual: NGC 1624.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of the star formation process and the origin of stellar initial mass function (IMF),\ndefined as the distribution of stellar masses at the time of birth, are key issues in astrophysics.\nSince majority of stars tend to form in clusters or groups, young star clusters are considered\nto be the fundamental units of star formation (Lada & Lada 2003). Young star clusters are\nuseful tool to study the IMF as they contain statistically significant number of young stars\nof rather similar age spanning a wide range of masses. Since these objects are not affected\nby the dynamical evolution as the ages of these objects are significantly less in comparison\nto their dynamical evolution time, the present day mass function (MF) of these objects can\nbe considered as the IMF. However, a recent study by Kroupa (2008) argues that even in\nthe youngest clusters, it is difficult to trace the IMF, as clusters evolve rapidly and therefore\neject a fraction of their members even at a very young age.\nIn the last decade, there have been a large number of studies in great detail in several\nyoung clusters within 2 kpc of the Sun investigating these issues (e.g., Lada & Lada 2003,\nPandey et al. 2008, Jose et al. 2008). Although the theoretical expectation is that the IMF\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: jessy@aries.res.in\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n3\n\nof a cluster should depend on the location, size, metallicity, density of the star forming\nenvironment and other conditions such as temperature or pressure (Zinnecker 1986; Larson\n1992; Price & Podsiadlowski 1995), for clusters located within 2 kpc, there is no compelling\nevidence for variation in the stellar IMF above the solar mass (e.g. Meyer et al. 2000; Kroupa\n2002; Chabrier 2005).\nWith the aim of understanding the star formation process and IMF in/around young star\nclusters, we selected an young cluster NGC 1624 (\u03b12000 = 04h 40m 38s .2; \u03b42000 = +50\u25e6 27\u203236\u2032\u2032 ;\nl=155.36; b=+2.62) associated with the bright optical H ii region Sh2-212 (Sharpless 1959).\nA colour composite image using the bands B, blue; [O iii] , green; and [S ii] , red for an area\n\u223c 10 \u00d7 10 arcmin2 centered at NGC 1624 is shown in Fig. 1 (left panel), where the cluster\nseems to be embedded in the H ii region. The cluster is located significantly above the formal\ngalactic plane (Z \u223c 250 pc) for an estimated distance of 6.0 kpc (cf. Sect. 5.3). The kinematic\nand spectrophotometric distances to NGC 1624 vary from 4.4 kpc (Georgelin & Georgelin\n1970) to 10.3 kpc (Chini & Wink 1984). An IRAS point source (IRAS 04366+5022) with\ncolours similar to that of the ultra-compact H ii (UCH ii ) region (Wood & Churchwell\n1989) is located at the periphery of Sh2-212. The molecular gas distribution of this region\nwas mapped by CO observations (Blitz et al. 1982; Leisawitz et al. 1989; Deharveng et al.\n2008).\nParticularly, Deharveng et al. (2008) studied the region using J = 2 \u2212 1 lines of\nand\n\n13\n\n12\n\nCO\n\nCO and reported a bright and thin semi-circular structure of molecular gas (in the\n\nvelocity range -34.0 kms\u22121 to -32.7 kms\u22121 ) in\n\n13\n\nCO at the rear side of Sh2-212 along with a\n\nfilamentary structure (-36.8 kms\u22121 to -35.9 kms\u22121 ) extending from southeast to northwest.\nThe semi-circular ring itself contains several molecular clumps, the most massive of which\n(-36.1 kms\u22121 to -35.1 kms\u22121 ) contains a massive young stellar object (YSO) which is the\nexciting source of the associated UCH ii region (see Fig. 1). They concluded that Sh2-212\nis a good example of massive-star formation triggered via the collect and collapse process.\nThey also reported the flow of ionized gas and suggested that this may be the indication\nof 'Champagne flow' towards the north of Sh2-212. A careful view of Fig. 1 (right panel)\nreveals that the central region of NGC 1624 is relatively devoid of gas and dust, whereas\nthe outer regions, particularly east, south-east and west seem to be obscured by molecular\ngas. However, it is to be noted that the semi-circular structure containing clumps is located\nat the rear side of the cluster.\nThe present study is an attempt to understand the stellar content, young stellar popu-\n\n\f4\n\nJose et al.\n\nlation and the form of IMF/ K-band luminosity function (KLF) of the cluster NGC 1624\nassociated with Sh2-212 using our optical and radio continuum observations along with the\nnear-infrared (NIR) archival data. In Sections 2 and 3, we describe the observations, data\nreductions and archival data used in the present work. Sections 4 to 8 describe various cluster parameters and young stellar properties derived using optical, NIR and radio continuum\ndata. Sections 9 and 10 describe the IMF and KLF of the region and in section 11 we have\nsummarized the results.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTIONS\n\nIn the following sections we describe the observations and data reductions carried out in\norder to have a detailed study of NGC 1624.\n\n2.1\n\nOptical CCD Photometry\n\nThe CCD UBV RI observations of NGC 1624 were carried out using Hanle Faint Object\nSpectrograph and Camera (HFOSC) of the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) of\nIndian Astronomical Observatory (IAO), Hanle, India on 2004 November 3. The 2048 \u00d7\n2048 CCD with a plate scale of 0.296 arcsec pixel\u22121 covers an area of \u223c 10\u00d710 arcmin2 on\nthe sky. We took short and long exposures in all filters to avoid saturation of bright stars.\nPG 0231 field from Landolt (1992) was observed to determine atmospheric extinction as well\nas to photometrically calibrate the CCD frames on the same night. The log of observations\nis tabulated in Table 1.\nThe CCD frames were bias-subtracted and flat-field corrected in the standard manner\nusing various tasks available under IRAF1 . Aperture photometry was done for the standard\nstars of PG 0231 field and the following calibration equations were derived using a leastsquares linear regression:\n\n(U \u2212 B) = (1.269 \u00b1 0.020)(u \u2212 b) \u2212 (2.617 \u00b1 0.026),\n(B \u2212 V ) = (0.915 \u00b1 0.016)(b \u2212 v) \u2212 (0.284 \u00b1 0.012),\n(V \u2212 R) = (1.056 \u00b1 0.013)(v \u2212 r) \u2212 (0.011 \u00b1 0.010),\n(V \u2212 I) = (1.022 \u00b1 0.009)(v \u2212 i) + (0.188 \u00b1 0.008),\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observatories, USA\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n5\n\nV = v + (0.024 \u00b1 0.011)(V \u2212 I) \u2212 (0.495 \u00b1 0.013),\n\nwhere, u, b, v, r, i are the instrumental magnitudes corrected for the atmospheric extinctions and U, B, V, R, I are the standard magnitudes. The standard deviations of the residuals,\n\u2206, between standard and transformed V magnitudes, (U \u2212B), (B \u2212V ), (V \u2212R) and (V \u2212I)\ncolours of standard stars were 0.020, 0.045, 0.018, 0.014 and 0.021 mag, respectively. Different frames of the cluster region having same exposure time and observed with the same\nfilters were averaged. Photometry of cleaned frames was carried out using the DAOPHOT-II\n(Stetson 1987) profile-fitting software.\nWe repeated the observations of NGC 1624 in V and Ic filters to get deeper photometry on\n2006 December 12 using the 104-cm Sampurnanand Telescope (ST) of Aryabhatta Research\nInstitute of observational sciencES (ARIES), Naini Tal, India. Log of the observations is\ngiven in Table 1. The 2048 \u00d7 2048 CCD with a plate scale of 0.37 arcsec pixel\u22121 covers\na field of \u223c 13 \u00d7 13 arcmin2 on the sky. To improve the signal to noise ratio (S/N), the\nobservations were carried out in binning mode of 2 \u00d7 2 pixel. Secondary standards from the\nHCT observations were used to calibrate the data taken with ST. A combined photometry\ncatalog is made using these two observations and this catalog has typical photometric errors\nof the order of \u223c 0.01 mag at brighter end (V \u223c 15), whereas the errors increase towards\nthe fainter end (\u223c 0.04 at V \u223c 21). The catalog is available in electronic form and a sample\ntable is given in Table 2.\nIn order to check the accuracy of the present photometry, we compared our photometry\nwith the UBV photometry of 14 stars carried out by Moffat et al. (1979). The mean and\nstandard deviation of the difference between Moffat's and our photometry in V , U \u2212 B and\nB \u2212 V are 0.008 \u00b1 0.006, 0.005 \u00b1 0.015 and 0.004 \u00b1 0.006, respectively, suggesting that the\ntwo photometries are in good agreement.\nTo study the luminosity function (LF)/MF, it is necessary to take into account the\nincompleteness of the present data that could occur due to various factors (e.g., crowding\nof the stars). We used ADDSTAR routine of DAOPHOT-II to determine the completeness\nfactor (CF). The procedure has been outlined in detail in our earlier work (see e.g., Pandey\net al. 2001). Briefly, we randomly added artificial stars to both V and I images taken with\nST in such a way that they have similar geometrical locations but differ in I brightness\naccording to mean (V \u2212 I) colour (\u223c 1.5 mag) of the data sample. Luminosity distribution\nof artificial stars was chosen in such a way that more number of stars were inserted towards\n\n\f6\n\nJose et al.\n\nthe fainter magnitude bins. The frames were reduced using the same procedure used for the\noriginal frames. The ratio of the number of stars recovered to those added in each magnitude\ninterval gives the CF as a function of magnitude. Minimum value of the CF of the pair (i.e.,\nV - and I-bands ) for the cluster region and field region (outside the cluster region), given\nin Table 3, is used to correct the data incompleteness.\n2.2\n\nSpectroscopic observations\n\nLow resolution optical spectroscopic observations of 4 optically bright sources of NGC 1624\nwere made using HFOSC of HCT. The log of observations is given in Table 1. The spectra\nin the wavelength range 3800-6840 \u00c5 with a dispersion of 1.45 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 were obtained\nusing low resolution grism 7 with a slit having width 2\u2032\u2032 . One-dimensional spectra were\nextracted from the bias-subtracted and flat-field corrected images using the optimal extraction method in IRAF. Wavelength calibration of the spectra were done using FeAr and FeNe\nlamp sources. Spectrophotometric standard (Feige 110) was observed on 2006 September 08\nand flux calibration was applied to the star observed on the same night.\n2.3\n\nRadio Continuum Observations\n\nRadio continuum observations at 1280 MHz were carried out on 2007 July 17 using the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), India. GMRT has a 'Y' shaped hybrid configuration of\n30 antennae, each of 45 m diameter. Details of the GMRT antennae and their configurations\ncan be found in Swarup et al. (1991). For the observations, the primary flux density calibrators used were 3C48 and 3C286. NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) was\nused for the data reduction. The data were carefully checked for radio frequency interference\nor other problems and suitably edited. Self calibration was carried out to remove the residual\neffects of atmospheric and ionospheric phase corruptions and to obtain the improved maps.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nARCHIVAL DATA\nNear-infrared data from 2MASS\n\nNIR JHKs data for point sources within a radius of 10 arcmin around NGC 1624 have\nbeen obtained from Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Point Source Catalog (PSC)\n(Cutri et al. 2003). To improve photometric accuracy, we used photometric quality flag\n(ph qual = AAA) which gives a S/N > 10 and a photometric uncertainty < 0.10 mag. This\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n7\n\nselection criterion ensures best quality detection in terms of photometry and astrometry as\ngiven on the 2MASS website2 . The JHKs data were transformed from 2MASS system to\nthe California Institute of Technology (CIT) system using the relations given by Carpenter\n(2001). We used this data set to calibrate the NIR archival data from Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope (CFHT) (see Sect. 3.2) and also to produce the radial density profile of NGC 1624\n(see Sect. 4.2).\n\n3.2\n\nNear-infrared data from CFHT\n\nNIR data for the region were obtained from the Canadian Astrophysical Data Centre's\n(CADC) archive program. The NIR observations of the region were taken on 2002 October\n20 (PI: L. Deharveng) using the instrument CFHT-IR at the 3.56-m CFHT. The 1024 \u00d7 1024\npixel HgCdTe detector with a plate scale of 0.211 arcsec/pixel was used for the observations.\nThe catalog by Deharveng et al. (2008) lists a total of 891 sources in JHK bands. Since\nour aim was to study the KLF of the region, where the estimation of the completeness of\nthe photometry (ref. Sect. 2.1) was necessary, we re-reduced the CFHT observations. We\nused dithered images at 9 different locations having 10 frames at each position around the\nUCH ii region of this field. Flat frames and sky frames were made from the median combined\nobject frames. The sky subtracted and flat field corrected dithered images in each band were\naligned and then combined to achieve a higher S/N. The final mosaic image covers an area\nof 5\u2032 .2 \u00d7 5\u2032 .2 with the UCH ii region at the centre and is shown in Fig. 1.\nPhotometry of the processed images were obtained using the DAOPHOT-II package in\nIRAF. Since the region was crowded, we performed PSF photometry on the images. The\n2MASS counterparts of the CFHT sources were searched within a match radius of 1 arcsec.\nThe CFHT instrumental magnitudes were compared to the selected 2MASS magnitudes\nto define a slope and zero point for the photometric calibration. The rms scatter between\nthe calibrated CFHT and 2MASS data (i.e., 2MASS \u2212 CF HT data) for the J, H and Kbands were 0.07, 0.08 and 0.06, respectively. In order to check the photometric accuracy, we\ncompared our photometry with the photometry reported by Deharveng et al. (2008). The\naverage dispersion between these two samples was \u223c 0.1 mag in JHK bands with absolutely\nno shift, which shows that the present photometry is in agreement with the previous study.\nTo ensure good photometric accuracy, we limited our sample with those stars having error\n2\n\nhttp://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc/\n\n\f8\n\nJose et al.\n\n< 0.15 mag in all three bands and thus we obtained photometry for 951 sources in J, H and\nK-bands. Additional 31 sources detected only in the H and K bands (J drop out sources)\nhaving error < 0.15 mag are also included in our analysis. Data of three saturated sources\nhave been taken from the 2MASS catalog. The detection limits were 19.0, 18.4 and 18.0\nmag for J, H and K-bands, respectively. We combined the optical and NIR catalog within\na match radius of 1 arcsec and the final catalog used in the present analysis is available in\nelectronic form and a sample table is shown in Table 2. We estimated the completeness limit\nof the data using the ADDSTAR routine of DAOPHOT-II. The procedure was the same\nas mentioned for the optical images (see Sect. 2.1). Completeness was greater than 90% for\nmagnitudes brighter than 17.0 and reduced to 80 % for the magnitude range 17.0 - 17.5 in\nK-band. We did not find any significant spatial variation of the completeness factor within\nthe entire area of 5\u2032 .2 \u00d7 5\u2032 .2 and hence we used an average completeness factor of the region\nfor our analysis.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE CLUSTER\nTwo dimensional surface density distribution\n\nThe initial stellar distribution in star clusters may be governed by the structure of parental\nmolecular cloud and also how star formation proceeds in the cloud (Chen et al. 2004, Sharma\net al. 2006). Later evolution of the cluster may then be governed by internal gravitational\ninteraction among member stars and external tidal forces due to the Galactic disk or giant\nmolecular clouds.\nTo study the morphology of the cluster, we generated isodensity contours for stars in Kband from CFHT data and is shown in Fig. 2. The contours are plotted above 3-sigma value\nof the background level as estimated from the control field. The star mark in Fig. 2 represents\nthe location of the cluster centre (Sect. 4.2). The surface density distribution of the CFHT\ndata reveals prominent sub-structures which seem to be distributed symmetrically around\nthe cluster centre at a radial distance of \u223c 35 arcsec. Interestingly, these sub-structures are\nlying just inside the thin molecular layer shown in Fig. 1.\n4.2\n\nRadial stellar surface density and cluster size\n\nThe radial extent of a cluster is one of the important parameters used to study the dynamical\nstate of the cluster. We used the star count technique to study the surface density distribution\n\n\f9\n\nYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\nof stars in the cluster region and to derive the radius of the cluster. To determine the cluster\ncentre, we used the stellar density distribution of stars in a \u00b1 30 pixel wide strip along both\nX and Y directions around an eye estimated centre. The point of maximum density obtained\nby fitting a Gaussian curve was considered as the centre of the cluster. The coordinates of\nthe cluster centre were found to be \u03b12000 = 04h 40m 38s .2 \u00b1 1s .0; \u03b42000 = +50\u25e627\u2032 36\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 15\u2032\u2032 .\nTo investigate the radial structure of the cluster, we derived the radial density profile\n(RDP) using the ST observations for V 6 20 mag and 2MASS Ks -band data (Ks 6 14.3\nmag). Sources were counted in concentric annular rings of 30 arcsec width around the cluster\ncentre and the counts were normalized by the area of each annulus. The densities thus\nobtained are plotted as a function of radius in Fig. 3, where, one arcmin at the distance of\nthe cluster (6.0 kpc, cf. Sect. 5.3) corresponds to \u223c 1.8 pc. The upper and lower panels show\nthe RDPs obtained from optical and 2MASS Ks -band data, respectively. The error bars are\nderived assuming that the number of stars in each annulus follows Poisson statistics.\nRadius of the cluster (rcl ) is defined as the point where the cluster stellar density merges\nwith the field stellar density. The horizontal dashed line in Fig. 3 shows the field star density.\nFor the optical RDP, the field star density is determined from the corner of our optical CCD\nimage, whereas for the NIR RDP, the field star density is determined from an area which is\n10 arcmin away from the cluster centre. The error limits in the field density distribution are\nshown using dotted lines.\nTo parametrize the RDP, we fitted the observed RDP with the empirical model of King\n(1962) which is given by\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c10\nr\n1+\nrc\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n(1)\n\nwhere rc is the core radius at which the surface density \u03c1(r) becomes half of the central\ndensity, \u03c10 . The best fit to the observed RDPs obtained by a \u03c72 minimization technique\nis shown in Fig. 3. The core radii thus estimated from optical and NIR RDPs are 0.50 \u00b1\n0.06 and 0.48 \u00b1 0.05 arcmin, respectively. Within errors, the King's profile (Fig. 3, solid\ncurve) seems to be merging with the background field at \u223c 2.0 arcmin both for the optical\nand 2MASS data. Hence, we assign a radius of 2.0 arcmin for NGC 1624. Here we would\nlike to point out that the core radius and boundary of the cluster are estimated assuming\na spherically symmetric distribution of stars within the cluster. This approach is frequently\nused to estimate the extent of a cluster.\n\n\f10\n5\n5.1\n\nJose et al.\nANALYSIS OF OPTICAL DATA\nReddening in the cluster\n\nTo study the nature of the extinction law towards NGC 1624, we used two-colour diagrams\n(TCDs) as described by Pandey et al. (2003). The TCDs of the form of (V \u2212\u03bb) versus (B\u2212V ),\nwhere \u03bb is one of the broad-band filters (R, I, J, H, K, L), provide an effective method for\nseparating the influence of normal extinction produced by the diffuse interstellar medium\nfrom that of the abnormal extinction arising within regions having a peculiar distribution of\ndust sizes (cf. Chini & Wargau 1990; Pandey et al. 2000). The\n\nE(V \u2212\u03bb)\nE(B\u2212V )\n\nvalues in NGC 1624\n\nare estimated using the procedure as described in Pandey et al. (2003). The slopes of the\ndistributions mcluster are found to be identical to the normal values as given in Pandey et\nal. (2003). Thus we adopt a normal reddening law (RV = 3.1) for NGC 1624.\nIn the absence of spectroscopic observations, the interstellar extinction E(B \u2212V ) towards\nthe cluster region can be estimated using the (U \u2212 B)/(B \u2212 V ) colour-colour (CC) diagram.\nThe CC diagram of NGC 1624 (r 6 2\u2032 ) is presented in Fig. 4, where, continuous curves\nrepresent the empirical zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) locus by Girardi et al. (2002). The\nZAMS locus is reddened by E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.76 and 1.00 mag along the normal reddening\nvector (i.e., E(U \u2212 B)/E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.72). Fig. 4 indicates that majority of the O \u2212 A type\nstars have E(B \u2212 V ) in the range of 0.76 - 1.00 mag. The stars lying within the reddened\nZAMS may be probable members of NGC 1624. Using K/(J \u2212K) colour-magnitude diagram\n(CMD), Deharveng et al. (2008) have also reported AV \u223c 3 mag for the whole region. A\ncareful inspection of the CC diagram indicates the presence of further reddened population\nwhich could be the probable background population of the region. The theoretical ZAMS,\nshown by dashed line, is further shifted to match the reddened sequence. The E(B \u2212 V )\nvalue for the background population comes out to be \u223c 1.15 mag.\nReddening of individual stars having spectral types earlier than A0 have also been computed by means of the reddening free index Q (Johnson & Morgan 1953). Assuming a normal\nreddening law we can construct a reddening-free parameter index Q = (U \u2212B) \u22120.72 \u00d7(B \u2212\nV ). For stars earlier than A0, value of Q will be < 0. For main-sequence (MS) stars, the intrinsic (B \u2212V )0 colour and colour-excess can be obtained from the relation (B \u2212V )0 = 0.332\u00d7Q\n(Johnson 1966; Hillenbrand et al. 1993) and E(B \u2212 V ) = (B \u2212 V ) \u2212 (B \u2212 V )0 , respectively.\nThe individual reddening of the massive stars down to A0 spectral class within NGC 1624\n(r 6 2\u2032 ) are found to vary in the range E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 0.76 - 1.05 mag implying the presence of\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n11\n\ndifferential reddening within the cluster. The AV values thus calculated for stars up to A0\nspectral class have been given in Table 2. Assuming the standard deviation of the residuals\n(cf. Sect. 2.1) as typical errors in photometry, we estimate a typical error in estimation of\nE(B \u2212 V ) as \u223c 0.05 mag.\n\n5.2\n\nSpectral classification of the bright sources in NGC 1624\n\nWe carried out low resolution spectroscopy of four optically bright sources within 2 arcmin\nradius of NGC 1624. These sources are referred as M2, M4, M9 and M8 (see Fig. 6 of\nDeharveng et al. 2008). The brightest source M2 is the probable ionizing source of Sh2-212\n(Moffat et al. 1979). This star was identified as an emission line star of class O5e by Hubble\n(1922). Moffat et al. (1979) classified this object as O5.5V star, whereas Chini & Wink (1984)\nclassified it as O6I type star. To determine the spectral type of this star, we extracted lowresolution, one dimensional spectrum. In the top panel of Fig. 5, we show the flux calibrated,\nnormalized spectrum of the ionizing source M2 with important lines identified and labeled.\nAmong the Balmer lines, H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 are relatively strong in emission compared to H\u03b3,\nwhich is weak in emission. The H\u03b4 and H\u01eb are in absorption. The other lines found in\nemission are He ii \u03bb 4686 and C iii \u03bb\u03bb 4647-50.\nIn the case of early type stars, the ratio of He i \u03bb 4471/He ii \u03bb 4542 is a primary indicator\nof the spectral type. This ratio is found to vary from less than 1 to 1 and greater than 1 as\nwe move from O5 to O7 and later types. The presence of strong He ii \u03bb 4542 in absorption\nwhich is often accompanied by weak N iii \u03bb\u03bb 4634-42 emission indicate a MS luminosity\nclass denoted by ((f)). The absorption strength of He ii \u03bb 4686 weakens while N iii emission\nstrength increases in intermediate luminosity classes, denoted by (f) category. Finally, the\nOf super giants show both He ii and N iii in strong emission (Walborn & Fitzpatrick 1990).\nThe ratio of He i \u03bb 4471/He ii \u03bb 4542 for M2 is found to be (i.e., Log EW = Log\n(EW(He i \u03bb 4471)/EW(He ii \u03bb 4542)) -0.15, implying that this star is likely to be of spectral\ntype earlier to O7. Following Conti & Alschuler (1971) we assign O6.5 \u00b1 0.5 spectral type\nto this star. The weak nature of N iii \u03bb\u03bb 4634-42 indicates that this star is likely to be in\nMS. Thus we assign a spectral class of O6.5 \u00b1 0.5 V for the ionizing source of Sh2-212.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 5 shows the low resolution spectrum for the star M4. The\nabsence of He ii \u03bb 4200, He ii \u03bb 4686 and Mg ii \u03bb 4481 indicates that the spectral class of\nM4 is between B1-B2 (Walborn & Fitzpatrick 1990). The lack of spectral lines Mg ii \u03bb 4481\n\n\f12\n\nJose et al.\n\nand Si iii \u03bb 4552 rules out the possibility of it being an evolved star. A comparison with\nthe low resolution stellar spectra of Jacoby et al. (1984) and Walborn & Fitzpatrick (1990)\nsuggests this star as a spectral class of B1.5 \u00b1 0.5 V.\nThe reddening slope E(B-V)/E(U-B) has also been obtained using the spectral types of\nthe M2 (06.5V ) and M4 (B1.5V) stars. The value of the slope using the intrinsic values\nfrom Koorneef (1984) / Johnson (1966) comes out to be 0. 86 / 0.83 and 0.75 / 0.73 for M2\nand M4, respectively. The reddening slope for the B type star agrees well the value obtained\nin Sect. \u00a75.1. We adopt a normal reddening law in the region as mentioned in Sect. \u00a75.1 for\nfurther analysis of the data.\nWe also extracted the low resolution spectra (not shown here) for the stars M8 and M9.\nPresence of the spectral lines Na i \u03bb 5893, Ca i \u03bb\u03bb 6122, 6162, Fe ii \u03bb 6456 and the line\nstrength of Fe i , Ca i \u03bb 6497 put these two stars in the mid F giant category based on the\nspectral atlas given by Torres-Dodgen & Weaver (1993) and Jacoby et al. (1984).\n\n5.3\n\nOptical colour-magnitude diagrams : Distance and age\n\nThe optical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are useful to derive the cluster fundamental\nparameters such as age, distance etc. Fig. 6 shows dereddened V0 /(B\u2212V )0 CMD for probable\ncluster members (Sect. 5.1) lying within r 6 2\u2032 of NGC 1624. The stars having spectral type\nearlier than A0 were dereddened individually using Q method as discussed in Sect. 5.1. The\nstars labeled as M2, M4, M8 and M9 (following the nomenclature by Deharveng et al. 2008)\nhave spectroscopic observations as discussed in Sect. 5.2. The spectral class of the ionizing\nsource (M2; see Sect. 5.2) yields intrinsic distance modulus of 14.05 which corresponds to\na distance of 6.5 kpc, whereas the spectral class of M4 yields intrinsic distance modulus\nof 13.8 which corresponds to a distance of 5.8 kpc. The average distance from these two\nspectroscopically identified cluster members comes out to be 6.15 kpc. We also calculated\nthe individual distance modulus of the remaining 12 probable MS stars (shown as filled\ncircles in Fig. 6). The intrinsic colours for each star were estimated using the Q method as\ndiscussed in Sect. 5.1. Corresponding MV values have been estimated using the ZAMS by\nGirardi et al. (2002). The average value of the intrinsic distance modulus obtained from the\n14 stars (2 from spectroscopy and 12 from photometry) comes out to be 13.9 \u00b1 0.3 which\ncorresponds to a distance of 6.0 \u00b1 0.8 kpc. In Fig. 6 we have also plotted the theoretical\nisochrone of 2 Myr (Z = 0.02; log age = 6.3) by Girardi et al. (2002), shifted for the distance\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n13\n\nmodulus of (m \u2212 MV )0 = 13.90 \u00b1 0.3, which seems to be matching well with the distribution\nof the probable MS members of the cluster. Present distance estimate is in agreement with\nthat obtained by Moffat et al. (1979; 6.0 \u00b1 0.5 kpc), whereas Chini & Wink (1984) have\nreported a distance of 10.4 kpc to NGC 1624. The distance estimates by Moffat et al. (1979)\nand Chini & Wink (1984) were based on the assumed spectral class of the ionizing source\nM2 (i.e., O5.5V and O6I, respectively). Here, it is worthwhile to mention that the MV value\nfor an O6V star in the literature varies significantly; e.g., MV = -5.5 (Schmidt-Kaler 1982)\nto -4.9 (Martins et al. 2005). Hence, the distance estimation based on the O-type star alone\nmay not be reliable. However, the present distance estimation is carried out using the O-type\nstar as well as all the probable members earlier to A0 spectral type. The kinematic distance\n(6.07 kpc) to the region derived by Caplan et al. (2000) is in agreement with the present\ndistance estimation. Since this cluster is located in the outer galactic disk, the possibility\nof a low metallicity for the region cannot be ruled out, which would imply bluer intrinsic\ncolour for the members and hence a closer distance of NGC 1624. However, in the absence\nof any metallicity measurements towards this region, we have considered solar metallicity\nfor the region and the distance of NGC 1624 is taken as 6.0 kpc for the present study.\nThe ages of young clusters are typically derived from the post-main-sequence evolutionary tracks for the earliest members if significant evolution has occurred and/or by fitting the\nlow-mass contracting population with theoretical PMS isochrones. Since the most massive\nmember of NGC 1624 seems to be a O6.5 MS star, the maximum age of the cluster should\nbe of the order of the MS life time of the massive star i.e., \u223c 4.4 Myr (Meynet et al. 1994).\nIn Fig. 6 we have also shown the isochrone of 4 Myr age by Girardi et al. (2002), which\nsuggests that the maximum post-main-sequence age of the cluster could be \u223c 4 Myr. Stars\nwhich deviate significantly from the isochrone are likely field stars and are shown by open\ncircles in Fig. 6, which include stars M8 and M9. Spectroscopic observations of these two\nstars indicate that they are of mid F giant spectral category (see Sect. 5.2) and hence cannot\nbe the cluster members at this assumed distance and age.\nV /(V \u2212 I) CMD for the stars lying within the core of the cluster (r 6 0\u2032 .5) is shown\nin Fig. 7a and CMD for the stars outside the core (0\u2032 .5 6 r 6 2\u2032 ) is shown in Fig. 7b. In\norder to find out the field star contamination in the cluster region, we selected a control field\nhaving same area as that of the cluster from the corner of our CCD image. V /(V \u2212 I) CMD\nfor the control field is shown in Fig. 7c. Assuming E(B \u2212 V )min = 0.76 mag, E(B \u2212 V )max\n=1.0 mag and using the relations AV = 3.1 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ); E(V \u2212 I) = 1.25 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ), we\n\n\f14\n\nJose et al.\n\nhave plotted theoretical isochrone of 2 Myr by Girardi et al. (2002) and pre-main-sequence\n(PMS) isochrone of 0.5 and 5 Myr (Siess et al. 2000) in Fig. 7. It is evident from this figure\nthat the MS (V 6 16.5) is rather free from field star contamination. Although the CMDs of\nthe cluster region show a significant number of stars towards the right of the 2 Myr isochrone\nat (V \u2212 I) > 2.5 and V > 18 mag, a comparison between the cluster and field regions clearly\nreveals the contamination due to field star population in the CMD of the cluster region.\nHowever, the V /(V \u2212 I) CMD of the core (Fig. 7a) reveals uncontaminated population of\nPMS stars having ages 0.5 - 5 Myr.\nAs discussed in Sect. 5.1, there is indication for a population in the background of the\ncluster which is apparent in Figs. 7b and 7c. Assuming the average E(B \u2212V ) = 1.15 mag, we\nestimate that the distance of the background population is \u223c 8 kpc. The study by Pandey\net al. (2006) also indicates a background population at a distance of \u223c 8 kpc in the second\ngalactic quadrant.\n\n5.4\n\nEmission from ionized gas\n\nFig. 8 shows GMRT radio continuum map of Sh2-212 at 1280 MHz made with a resolution of\n\u223c 4\u2032\u2032 .9 \u00d7 3\u2032\u2032 .2. In the high resolution map, most of the extended diffuse emission associated\nwith the region appears quite faint. However, a compact intense emission can be seen at the\nposition of UCH ii region (04h40m 27s .5, +50\u25e6 28\u2032 28\u2032\u2032 ) located at the periphery of Sh2-212 and\nis marked using an arrow. The UCH ii region is associated with the IRAS point source IRAS\n04366+5022. The overall morphology of the map agrees well with that of our optical colour\ncomposite image shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 9 shows an enlarged version of the UCH ii region\nat 1280 MHz. The integrated flux densities from the radio continuum contour maps for\nthe evolved H ii region (i.e., Sh2-212) and UCH ii region are estimated to be 3.6 \u00b1 0.4 Jy\nand 16.5 \u00b1 0.5 mJy, respectively. Assuming the ionized regions to be spherically symmetric\nand neglecting absorption of ultraviolet radiation by dust inside the H ii region, the above\nflux densities together with assumed distance, allow us to estimate the number of Lyman\ncontinuum photons (NLyc ) emitted per second, and hence the spectral type of the exciting\nstars. Using the relation given by Mart\u0131\u0301n-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2003) for an electron temperature\nof 10000 K, we estimated log NLyc = 48.29 and log NLyc = 45.96 for the evolved H ii and\nUCH ii region, respectively, which corresponds to MS spectral types of \u223c O7 and \u223c B0.5,\nrespectively (Vacca et al. 1996). On the basis of optical spectroscopy, we estimated spectral\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n15\n\ntype of the ionizing source of Sh2-212 as O6.5V (see Sect. 5.2) which is in fair agreement\nwith the above spectral type estimation from integrated radio continuum flux. Using the\nspectral energy distribution, Deharveng et al. (2008) have found that the source associated\nwith the UCH ii region is a massive YSO of \u223c B0 type (\u223c 14 M\u2299 ), which is in agreement\nwith the spectral type \u223c B0 obtained in the present work.\n\n6\n\nANALYSIS OF NEAR-INFRARED DATA\n\nNIR data are very useful tools to study the nature of young stellar population within the star\nforming regions (SFRs). Discriminating young stars in clusters from field stars is difficult.\nYoung stars with strong infrared (IR) excess from disks and envelopes can be identified using\nthe NIR and mid-IR (MIR) observations. We used the CFHT deep NIR photometry to study\nthe PMS contents and KLF of NGC 1624. The CFHT K-band mosaic image centered on\nthe UCH ii region covering an area of 5\u2032 .2 \u00d7 5\u2032 .2 is shown in Fig. 1 (right panel), where\nthe ionizing source is marked with a white circle. A very rich cluster is apparent around\nthe ionizing source. Since the centre of NGC 1624 is located towards the eastern edge of\nthe CFHT frame, eastern half of the cluster is covered partially. The observations covered\nan area \u223c 9.6 arcmin2 of NGC 1624 and is shown using a partial circle in Fig. 1. A region\ncovering an area \u223c 3.1 arcmin2 towards north of the cluster shown by a box in Fig. 1, is\nconsidered as the control field. In the following sections, we discuss the NIR CC diagram\nand CMDs.\n\n6.1\n\nColour-Colour Diagrams\n\nNIR and MIR photometry are useful tools to investigate the fraction of YSOs in a SFR. In\nthe absence of ground based L-band observations or Spitzer based MIR observations, we used\n(J \u2212H)/(H \u2212K) CC diagram to identify the young stellar population in NGC 1624 (Hunter\net al. 1995; Haisch et al. 2000; 2001; Sugitani et al. 2002; Devine et al. 2008; Chavarr\u0131\u0301a et al.\n2010). The (J \u2212 H)/(H \u2212 K) CC diagrams for the cluster region (area \u223c 9.6 arcmin2 ) and\nthe control field (area \u223c 3.1 arcmin2 ) are shown in Fig. 10. The thin and thick solid curves\nare the locations of unreddened MS and giant stars (Bessell & Brett 1988), respectively. The\ndotted and dotted-dashed lines represent the locus of unreddened and reddened (AV = 4.0\nmag) classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; Meyer et al. 1997). The two long parallel dashed lines\nare the reddening vectors for the early MS and giant type stars (drawn from the base and tip\n\n\f16\n\nJose et al.\n\nof the two branches). One more reddening vector is plotted from the tip of the unreddened\nCTTS locus. The crosses on the reddening vectors are separated by an AV value of 5 mag.\nThe extinction ratios, AJ /AV = 0.265, AH /AV = 0.155 and AK /AV = 0.090, are adopted\nfrom Cohen et al. (1981). The magnitudes, colours and the curves are in CIT system.\nPresently YSOs are classified as an evolutionary sequence spanning a few million years\nas: Class 0/Class I - the youngest embedded protostars surrounded by infalling envelopes\nand growing accretion disks; Class II - PMS stars with less active accretion disks and Class\nIII - PMS stars with no disks or optically thin remnant disk (Adams et al. 1987). Following\nOjha et al. (2004a), we classified sources according to their locations in (J \u2212H)/(H \u2212K) CC\ndiagrams. The 'F' sources are those located between the reddening vectors projected from\nthe intrinsic colours of MS and giant stars. These sources are reddened field stars (MS and\ngiants) or Class III/Class II sources with little or no NIR excess (viz., weak-lined T Tauri\nsources (WTTSs) but some CTTSs may also be included). The sources located redward\nof region 'F' are considered to have NIR excess. Among these, the 'T' sources are located\nredward of 'F' but blueward of the reddening line projected from the red end of the CTTS\nlocus. These sources are considered to be mostly CTTSs (Class II objects) with large NIR\nexcesses (Lada & Adams 1992). There may be an overlap in NIR colours of Herbig Ae/Be\nstars and T Tauri stars in the 'T' region (Hillenbrand et al. 1992). The 'P' sources are those\nlocated in the region redward of region 'T' and are most likely Class I objects (protostellarlike) showing large amount of NIR excess. Here it is worthwhile to mention that Robitaille\net al. (2006) have shown that there is a significant overlap between protostellar-like objects\nand CTTSs in the CC diagram.\nA comparison of the colour distribution of the sources in the cluster and control field\n(Fig. 10) suggests that there is an appreciable difference between them. Significant fraction\nof sources in the cluster region are concentrated between the unreddened and reddened\nCTTS locus, whereas majority of sources in the control field are mainly concentrated in the\n'F' region. Statistically, we can safely assume that majority of sources of the cluster region\nlocated between the unreddened and reddened CTTS locus are most likely to be cluster\nmembers. The comparison also indicates that the sources located in the 'F' region could\nbe the reddened field stars but a majority of them are likely candidate WTTSs or CTTSs\nwith little or no NIR excess. The sources lying towards the right side of the reddening\nvector at the boundary of 'F' and 'T' regions and above the unreddened CTTS locus can\nbe safely considered as YSO/NIR excess sources. A total of 120 such sources have been\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n17\n\ndetected within a 5\u2032 .2 \u00d7 5\u2032 .2 region which fall in the 'T' region and above the unreddened\nCTTS locus. However, this number is certainly a lower limit for the population of YSOs,\nas several of the cluster members detected in the H and K bands have not been detected\nin the J-band. Moreover, L-band or MIR observations would further increase the detection\nof YSOs in the region. Hence the present JHK photometry provides only a lower limit to\nthe population of YSOs in NGC 1624. The distribution of YSOs in Fig. 10 manifests that\nmajority of them have AV 6 4 mag. Some of the sources in 'F' and 'T' regions, which might\nbe the candidate WTTSs/CTTSs, show AV values higher than 4 mag. The AV for each star\nlying in 'T' region has been estimated by tracing back to the intrinsic CTTS locus along\nthe reddening vector. The AV for stars within the cluster region (area \u223c 9.6 arcmin2 ) and\nlocated in the 'F' region is estimated by tracing them back to the extension of the intrinsic\nCTTS locus (see Ogura et al. 2007; Chauhan et al. 2009 for details). The AV values thus\ncalculated for the sources in 'F' and 'T' regions are given in Table 2. Twenty one sources\nare found to have AV > 6.0 mag, indicating that significant number of cluster members in\nthe region may still be embedded.\n\n6.2\n\nThe colour-magnitude diagram\n\nFig. 11 shows J/(J \u2212 H) distribution of sources within \u223c 9.6 arcmin2 area of NGC 1624.\nThe encircled are the NIR excess sources in this region. The thick solid curve denotes the\nlocus of 2 Myr PMS isochrone from Siess et al. (2000), which is the average age of NIR\nexcess sources (see Sect. 7.1, Fig. 13) and the thin curve is the 2 Myr isochrone from Girardi\net al. (2002). Both the isochrones are shifted for the cluster distance and reddening. The\ncontinuous oblique lines denote the reddening trajectories up to AV = 10 mag for PMS stars\nof 2 Myr age having masses 0.1, 2.0 and 3.0 M\u2299 , respectively. For the assumed age \u223c 2\nMyr, reddening AV = 2.5 mag and distance = 6.0 kpc, the J-band detection limit of present\nobservations corresponds to M \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 . In Fig. 11 majority of NIR excess sources (\u223c 98\n%) are seen to have masses in the range 0.1 to 3.0 M\u2299 .\nThe CMD indicates that the stellar population in NGC 1624 significantly comprises of\nlow mass PMS stars similar to other SFRs studied by Ojha et al. (2004a), Sharma et al.\n(2007), Pandey et al. (2008) and Jose et al. (2008). These results further support the scenario\nthat the high mass star forming regions are not devoid of low mass stars (e.g., Lada & Lada\n1991; Zinnecker et al. 1993; Tapia et al. 1997; Ojha et al. 2004a). The distribution of stars\n\n\f18\n\nJose et al.\n\nlocated below the CTTS locus (cf. Fig. 10) is shown by crosses in Fig. 11 which indicates\nthat a majority of these sources are likely to be field stars.\nThe brightest NIR excess source marked as a star symbol in Fig. 11 is the candidate\nionizing source of the UCH ii region. The extinction to this star is estimated by tracing\nit back to the ZAMS along the reddening vector and found to be AV \u223c 10.6 mag. This\nextinction should be considered as an upper limit, as the star shows NIR excess, therefore, J\nand H magnitudes might have been affected by the NIR excess emission. The photometric\nspectral type of this star comes out to be \u223c B0 which is in agreement with the spectral type\nestimation based on our radio continuum observations (see Sect. 5.4).\n\n7\n\nFIELD STAR DECONTAMINATION\n\nDistinguishing cluster members from field stars is a significant challenge for photometric\nsurveys of clusters. To study the LF/MF, it is necessary to remove field star contamination\nfrom the cluster region. Membership determination is also crucial for assessing the presence\nof PMS stars because both PMS and dwarf foreground stars occupy similar positions above\nthe ZAMS in the CMDs. As discussed in Sect. 6, some of the YSOs can be identified with the\nhelp of NIR excess, however this is not true for the diskless YSOs. An alternative is to study\nthe statistical distribution of stars in the cluster and field regions. Because proper motion\nstudies are not available for the stars in the cluster region, we used following statistical\ncriteria to estimate the number of probable members of NGC 1624.\nTo remove contamination due to field stars from the MS and PMS sample, we statistically\nsubtracted the contribution of field stars from the observed CMD of the cluster region using\nthe following procedure. For any star in the V /(V \u2212I) CMD of the control field (Fig. 7c), the\nnearest star in the cluster's V /(V \u2212 I) CMD (Figs. 7a and b) within V \u00b1 0.125 and (V \u2212 I)\n\u00b1 0.065 was removed. The statistically cleaned V /(V \u2212 I) CMD (SCMD) of the cluster\nregion is shown in Fig. 12, which clearly shows a sequence towards red side of the MS. PMS\nisochrones by Siess et al. (2000) for ages 0.5 and 5 Myr (dashed lines) and 2 Myr isochrone\nby Girardi et al. (2002) (continuous line) are shown in Fig. 12. The evolutionary tracks by\nSiess et al. (2000) for different masses are also shown which are used to determine the masses\nof PMS cluster members. Here we would like to remind the readers that the points shown\nby filled circles in Fig. 12 may not represent the actual members of the clusters. However,\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n19\n\nthe filled circles should represent the statistics of PMS stars in the region and the statistics\nhas been used to study the MF of the cluster region (cf. Sect. 9).\nWe followed the above technique for the field star decontamination of the NIR data as\nwell. Since the area of the selected field region is smaller in comparison to the cluster region,\nwe subdivided the cluster region in to three sub regions having area equal to the field region.\nThe field star contamination from J/(J \u2212 H) CMD of the cluster sub regions was subtracted\nusing the J/(J \u2212 H) CMD of the field region in a similar manner as in the case of V /(V \u2212 I)\nCMD.\n\n7.1\n\nYoung stellar population in NGC 1624\n\nIt is found that nineteen percent of the candidate PMS stars located above the intrinsic\nCTTS locus (cf. Fig. 10) have optical counterparts in V -band within 9.6 arcmin2 area. The\nV /(V \u2212 I) CMD for these sources is shown in Fig. 13. The encircled are the NIR excess\nsources which are the likely candidate YSOs (see Sect. 6.1). PMS isochrones by Siess et al.\n(2000) for 0.5, 2, 5 Myr (dashed curves) and isochrone for 2 Myr by Girardi et al. (2002;\ncontinuous curve) corrected for cluster distance and reddening are also shown. Fig. 13 reveals\nthat majority of the sources have ages 6 5 Myr with a possible age spread of \u223c 0.5 \u2212 5\nMyr and \u223c 75% of the NIR excess sources show ages 6 2 Myr. Since the reddening vector\nin V /(V \u2212 I) CMD (see Fig. 13) is nearly parallel to the PMS isochrone, the presence of\nvariable extinction in the region will not affect the age estimation significantly. Therefore\nthe age spread indicates a possible non-coeval star formation in this region.\nThe membership of the YSOs shown in Fig. 13 is calculated using the following procedure.\nEach YSO is corrected for its reddening calculated in the Sect. 6.1. The intrinsic (V \u2212 I)\ncolour thus obtained is then compared with the PMS isochrones of varying ages from 5 Myr\nto 0.1 Myr. The MV value of each YSO is obtained from the best matching isochrone and\nhence the distance modulus. The sources lying within 3\u03c3 of the distance modulus obtained\nin Sect. 5.3 are considered as the probable cluster members. It is found that three sources do\nnot satisfy the above criteria and has been considered as non-members. These three sources\nare marked using box in Fig. 13.\nA comparison of Fig. 13 with the field star decontaminated CMD shown in Fig. 12 reveals\na nice resemblance, suggesting that the statistics of PMS sources selected on the basis of\nSCMD can be used to study the IMF of PMS population of NGC 1624. As most of the\n\n\f20\n\nJose et al.\n\nsources in Fig. 13 are located in the PMS region, it can be safely assumed that the sources\nlying above the unreddened CTTS locus of Fig. 10 are likely cluster members. Thus sources\nfalling in the 'F' region (see Fig. 10) are likely to be WTTSs or CTTSs with little or no\nNIR excess and those in the 'T' region are the candidate CTTSs with NIR excess. However,\nFig. 13 does not show any trend in age distribution between these sources. A comparison of\nFigs. 11 and 12 confirms that most of the YSOs have masses 6 3.0 M\u2299 .\nThe fraction of NIR excess sources in a cluster is also an age indicator because the\ndisks/envelopes become optically thin with age (Haisch et al. 2001; Carpenter et al. 2006;\nHern\u00e1ndez et al. 2007). For young embedded clusters having age 6 1 \u00d7 106 yr, the disk\nfraction obtained from JHK photometry is \u223c 50% (Lada et al. 2000; Haisch et al. 2000).\nWhereas the fraction reduces to \u223c 20% for the clusters with age \u223c 2 - 3 \u00d7 106 yr ( Lada\n& Lada 1995; Haisch et al. 2001; Teixeira et al. 2004; Oliveira et al. 2005). After correcting\nfor the field star contamination and photometric incompleteness, the fraction of NIR excess\nsources in an area \u223c 9.6 arcmin2 of NGC 1624 is estimated to be \u223c 20%. There are 31 J\ndrop-out sources falling within our error criteria. Based on the colour and spatial distribution\nof these J drop-out sources (see Sect. 8), we presume that they can be included in the list\nof candidate YSOs and hence the NIR excess fraction increases to \u223c 25%. This suggests an\nage of \u223c 2 - 3 \u00d7 106 yr for this cluster which is in agreement with the age estimation derived\nusing the PMS evolutionary tracks in the optical CMD (cf. Fig. 13). This NIR excess fraction\nis to be considered as a lower limit to the actual YSO fraction of the cluster as we do not\nhave L-band observations for this cluster. However, Yasui et al. (2009) point out that the\ndisk fraction from only JHK data are about 0.6 of those from JHKL data and the lifetime\nestimation from JHK data is basically identical to that from JHKL data. Therefore, despite\na little larger uncertainty, the disk fraction from JHK data alone should still be effective\neven without L-band data. Here it is worthwhile to point out that in the case of Cep OB3B,\nGetman et al. (2009) have shown that the disk frequency depends on the distance from\nthe exciting stars, as massive stars can photo-evaporate the disk around young stars. Also,\nCarpenter et al. (2006) have found evidence for mass dependent circumstellar disk evolution\nin the sense that the mechanism for disk dispersal operates less efficiently for low mass stars.\nHence, keeping in mind the uncertainties mentioned above, the age estimation based on the\ndisk frequency must be considered as an approximate estimation.\nIn order to check if there is any mass dependence of the NIR excess fraction, we divided\nthe optically identified PMS members (shown in Fig. 13) in to three mass bins i.e., 2.5 - 1.5\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n21\n\nM\u2299 , 1.5 - 1.0 M\u2299 and 1.0 - 0.6 M\u2299 using the evolutionary tracks by Siess et al. (2000). After\napplying the completeness correction in each magnitude bin, we obtained the NIR excess\nfraction as 23%, 24% and 37%, respectively for the above mentioned mass bins. Hence, there\nis an evidence of mass dependent evolution of circumstellar disk as explained by Carpenter\net al. (2006). However, this estimation has to be considered as a lower limit, as only 19% of\nthe identified NIR PMS stars have the optical counterparts.\nDeharveng et al. (2005; 2008) have identified signs of recent star formation in Sh2-212.\nThey estimated the age of the massive star associated with the UCH ii region located at\nthe periphery of Sh2-212 as \u223c 0.14 Myr on the basis of dynamical size of the UCH ii region.\nThis indicates that the UCH ii region is relatively young as compared to the YSOs within\nthe cluster region. The bright rim feature at one end of the UCH ii region (see Fig. 2 of\nDeharveng et al. 2008) also suggests that the UCH ii region might have formed at a later\nevolutionary stage of the H ii region as a second generation object.\n\n8\n\nSPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF YSOS\n\nFig. 14 displays the spatial distribution of YSOs (blue circles; likely Class II sources) identified on the basis of NIR excess characteristics (cf. Fig. 10) along with the CO emission\ncontour map from Deharveng et al. (2008) for four condensations and filament. The J dropout sources are shown using red triangles. The molecular condensations make a semi-circular\nring towards the southern side of Sh2-212. Fig. 14 reveals that majority of YSOs are located\nclose to the cluster centre within a radius of 0.5 arcmin (i.e., within the cluster core radius\nof \u223c 0.9 pc; cf. Sect. 4.2), however, several other YSOs are found to be distributed outside of\nthis radius along the thin semi-circular ring and filamentary structure. Interestingly, there\nis an apparent concentration of YSOs just at the boundary of the clump C2.\nIn Fig. 15 we have shown the K/(H \u2212K) CMD for all the sources detected in this region.\nThe encircled are the YSOs and the red triangles are the J drop-out sources. It is evident\nfrom the CMD that majority of YSOs have (H \u2212 K) colour in the range \u223c 0.6 - 0.8 mag.\nHowever a significant number of sources appear to be redder (H \u2212K > 1.0 mag). The spatial\ndistribution of sources having (H \u2212 K) > 1.0 mag has been shown in Fig. 14 with filled\ncircles (i.e., YSOs) and triangles (J drop-out sources), respectively and this figure reveals a\nhigher density of reddened sources near the clump C2. The larger value of (H \u2212 K) (> 1.0\n\n\f22\n\nJose et al.\n\nmag) could be either due to higher extinction, as most of these sources are lying within/very\nclose to the CO distribution, or could be their intrinsic colour due to large NIR excess.\nIf the origin of this colour excess is merely from the interstellar extinction, then one must\nexpect an increment in the value of AV by \u223c 12 mag as compared to the sources located\nclose to the cluster center. In order to investigate the spatial distribution of extinction in the\nregion, we plot radial variation of AV in Fig. 16 (left panel). It is evident from the Fig. 16 that\nAV is almost constant within an 80 arcsec cluster radius. Hence, we can presume that the\norigin of colour excess could be intrinsic in nature. This fact indicates an age sequence in the\nsense that YSOs located/projected over the semi-circular ring of molecular condensations\nare younger than those lying within the core of the cluster.\nTo further elucidate the youth of the YSOs located/projected over the semi-circular ring\nof molecular condensations, we plot radial variation of NIR excess, \u2206(H \u2212 K), defined as\nthe horizontal displacement from the reddening vector at the boundary of F and T regions\n(see Fig. 10). NIR excess is considered to be a function of age. An enhancement in the\nmean value of \u2206(H \u2212 K) at \u223c 45 arcsec, i.e., near the periphery of the semi-circular ring is\napparent in Fig. 16 (middle panel). In the right panel we plot the radial variation of (H \u2212K)\ncolour of YSOs and J drop-out sources using dashed and solid histogram, respectively. The\nenhancement in the mean (H \u2212 K) value at the same location is apparent in this figure\nas well. However, we have to keep in mind the possibility of photo-evaporation of the disk\naround YSOs lying within the core of the cluster due to stellar radiation of massive star at\nthe centre of the cluster.\nThe above facts indicate that the sources near the molecular material are intrinsically\nredder and support the scenario of possible sequential star formation towards the direction\nof molecular clumps. It is interesting to mention that the distribution of YSOs in the NGC\n1624 region is rather similar to the distribution of Class II sources in other star forming\nregions. e.g., RCW 82 (Pomar\u00e8s et al. 2009), RCW 120 (Zavagno et al. 2007) and Sh2-284\n(Puga et al. 2009). Majority of Class I sources in the case of RCW 82 and RCW 120 are\nfound to be associated with the molecular material at their periphery and none are found\naround the ionizing source. The association of Class I sources with the molecular material\nmanifests the recent star formation at their periphery. If star formation in Sh2-212 region\nis similar in nature to RCW 82 and RCW 120, one would expect a significant number of\nClass I sources in the surrounding molecular material. Unfortunately, the absence of MIR\nobservations hampers the detailed study of the probable young sources lying towards the\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n23\n\ncollected molecular material. However, the YSOs having (H \u2212 K) > 1.0 mag, which are\nexpected to be the youngest sources of the region, are found to be distributed around the\nmolecular clumps detected by Deharveng et al. (2008). It is interesting to mention that in\nthe case of RCW 82, the YSOs having (H \u2212 K) > 1.0 mag are found to be associated\nwith the molecular emission surrounding the H ii region. Many of these sources are not\nobserved in the direction of molecular emission peaks, but are located on the borders of the\ncondensations (Pomar\u00e8s et al. 2009). A similar distribution of YSOs (having H \u2212 K > 1.0)\ncan be seen in the present study at the border of the clump C2.\nAccording to Deharveng et al. (2008), the massive YSO associated with the UCH II\nregion (clump C1) might have formed as a result of the collect and collapse process due to\nthe expansion of the H ii region. If the sources lying towards the molecular clump C2 and\nalong the filament are formed as a result of the collect and collapse process, these sources\nmust be younger than the ionization source by about 2 - 3 Myr as the model calculation\nby Deharveng at al. (2008) predicts the fragmentation of the collected layer after 2.2 - 2.8\nMyr of the formation of the massive star in Sh2-212. Since the ionization source is an O6.5\n\u00b1 0.5 MS star, the maximum age of the ionization source should be of the order of its MS\nlife time, i.e., \u223c 4.4 Myr (cf. Sect. 5.3). On the basis of the present analysis we can indicate\nthat the sources with (H \u2212 K) > 1.0 seem to have a correlation with the semi-circular ring\nof molecular condensations and should be younger than the age of the ionization source\nof the region. However in the absence of optical photometry, the reliable age estimation of\nthese YSOs is not possible. Since the distribution of youngest YSOs on the border of clump\nC2 has a resemblance to the distribution of Class I/ II YSOs in RCW 82, the formation of\nthese YSOs could be due to the result of small-scale Jeans gravitational instabilities in the\ncollected layer, or interactions of the ionization front with the pre-existing condensations as\nsuggested by Pomar\u00e8s et al. (2009) cannot be ignored.\n\n9\n\nINITIAL MASS FUNCTION\n\nThe distribution of stellar masses that form in a star formation event in a given volume of\nspace is called IMF and together with star formation rate, the IMF dictates the evolution\nand fate of galaxies and star clusters (Kroupa 2002). Young clusters are important tools\nto study IMF since their MF can be considered as IMF as they are too young to loose\n\n\f24\n\nJose et al.\n\nsignificant number of members either by dynamical or stellar evolution. To study the IMF\nof NGC 1624 we used the data within r 6 2\u2032 .\nThe MF is often expressed by the power law, N(log m) \u221d m\u0393 and the slope of the MF\nis given as\n\n\u0393 = d log N(log m)/d log m\nwhere N(log m) is the number of stars per unit logarithmic mass interval. For the mass\nrange 0.4 < M/M\u2299 6 10, the classical value derived by Salpeter (1955) for the slope of MF\nis, \u0393 = \u22121.35.\nSince the NIR data is deeper, we expect to have a better detection of YSOs towards the\nfainter end in comparison to the optical data. Therefore we estimated the IMF using the\noptical and NIR data independently.\n\n9.1\n\nIMF from optical data\n\nWith the help of SCMD shown in Fig. 12, we can derive the MF using theoretical evolutionary\nmodels. A mass\u2212luminosity relation is needed to convert the derived magnitude for each star\nto a mass. For the MS stars (see Fig. 6), LF was converted to MF using the theoretical model\nby Girardi et al. (2002) for 2 Myr (cf. Pandey et al. 2001; 2005). The MF for PMS stars\nwas obtained by counting the number of stars in various mass bins (shown as evolutionary\ntracks in Fig. 12). Necessary corrections for data incompleteness were taken into account for\neach magnitude bin to calculate the MF. The MF of NGC 1624 is plotted in Fig. 17. The\nslope, \u0393 of the MF in the mass range 1.2 6 M/M\u2299 < 27 can be represented by a power\nlaw. The slope of the MF for the mass range 1.2 6 M/M\u2299 < 27 comes out to be, \u0393 =\n\u22121.18 \u00b1 0.10, which is slightly shallower than the Salpeter value (-1.35). We conclude that\nwithin an acceptable margin, the slope of IMF for the cluster NGC 1624 is comparable to\nthe Salpeter (1955) value.\n\n9.2\n\nIMF from NIR data\n\nWe also estimate the IMF using J -band luminosity function (JLF). We preferred J-band\nover K-band as the former is least affected by the NIR excess. After removing the field\nstar contamination using the statistical subtraction as explained in Sect. 7, we applied the\ncompleteness correction to the J-band data. Assuming an average age of 2 Myr for the\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n25\n\nPMS stars, distance 6.0 kpc and average reddening AV = 2.5 mag, the J magnitudes were\nconverted to mass using the 2 Myr PMS isochrone by Siess et al. (2000). For MS stars, the\nmass-luminosity relation is taken from Girardi et al. (2002). Completeness of the J-band\ndata was \u223c 90 % at J = 18 mag (\u223c 0.65 M\u2299 ). In Fig. 18, we have shown the MF derived for\nNGC 1624 (within the area of \u223c 9.6 arcmin2 ) in the mass range 0.65 6 M/M\u2299 < 27. The\nlinear fit gives a slope \u0393 = \u22121.31\u00b10.15 which is in agreement with the Salpeter (1955) value.\nThe MF (\u0393 = \u22121.18 \u00b1 0.10) derived using optical data is slightly shallower than that of IR\ndata. However both the slopes are within error and can be considered to be in agreement.\nHere we would like to point out that the estimation of IMF depends on the models used.\nWe are pursuing studies of few young clusters, hence a comparative study of IMFs of various\nyoung clusters obtained using similar techniques will give useful information about IMFs.\nOur recent studies on young clusters (age \u223c 2\u22124 Myr), viz., NGC 1893 (Sharma et al. 2007),\nBe 59 (Pandey et al. 2008) and Stock 8 (Jose et al. 2008) have yielded the value of \u0393 for stars\nmore massive than \u223c 1 - 2 M\u2299 as -1.27 \u00b1 0.08, -1.01 \u00b1 0.11 and -1.38 \u00b1 0.12, respectively. A\ncomparison of the MF in the case of NGC 1624 and the clusters mentioned above indicates\nthat the MF slope towards massive end (i.e., M > 1M\u2299 ) in general, is comparable to the\nSalpeter value (-1.35).\n\n10\n\nK-BAND LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\n\nThe KLF is frequently used in studies of young clusters as a powerful tool to constrain its\nage and IMF. Pioneering work on the interpretation of KLF was presented by Zinnecker\net al. (1993). During the last decade several studies have been carried out with the aim\nof determining the KLF of young clusters (e.g., Muench et al. 2000; Lada & Lada 2003;\nOjha et al. 2004b; Sanchawala et al. 2007; Sharma et al. 2007; Pandey et al. 2008; Jose et\nal. 2008). We have used CFHT K-band data to study the KLF of NGC 1624. Because the\nCFHT observations did not include the entire cluster region, we restricted the KLF study\nto a region within \u223c 9.6 arcmin2 area of NGC 1624 (see Sect. 6).\nIn order to convert the observed KLF to the true KLF, it is necessary to correct the data\nincompleteness and field star contamination. We applied the CF (see Sect. 3.2) for the data\nincompleteness. The control field having an area \u223c 3.1 arcmin2 shown in Fig. 1 has been used\nto remove the field star contribution. We applied a correction factor to take into account\nthe different areas of cluster and control field regions. The field star population towards the\n\n\f26\n\nJose et al.\n\ndirection of NGC 1624 is also estimated by using the Besan\u00e7on Galactic model of stellar\npopulation synthesis (Robin et al. 2003) using a similar procedure as described by Ojha et\nal. (2004b). The star counts were predicted using the Besan\u00e7on model towards the direction\nof the control field. An advantage of using this model is that we can simulate foreground\n(d < 6.0 kpc) and background (d > 6.0 kpc) field star populations separately. The use of this\nmodel allows us to apply the extra cloud extinction to the background stars. The foreground\npopulation was simulated using the model with AV = 2.36 mag (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.76 mag;\nref. Sect. 5.1) and d < 6.0 kpc. The background population (d > 6.0 kpc) was simulated\nwith an extinction value AV = 4.0 mag (see Sect. 6.1). Thus we determined the fraction\nof the contaminating stars (foreground + background) over the total model counts. The\nscale factor we obtained to the control field direction was close to 1.0 in all the magnitude\nbins. This indicates that the moderate extinction of AV \u223c 4.0 mag is unlikely to have any\nsignificant effect on the field star distribution at this distance. Hence, we proceeded our\nanalysis of KLF with the field star counts obtained from the observed control field. The\ncompleteness corrected and field star subtracted KLF for NGC 1624 is shown in Fig. 19.\nThe KLFs of young embedded clusters are known to follow power-law shapes (Lada et\nal. 1991; 1993) which is expressed as:\ndN(K)\ndK\n\nwhere\n\ndN(K)\ndK\n\n\u221d 10\u03b1K\n\nis the number of stars per 0.5 mag bin and \u03b1 is the slope of the power law.\n\nThe KLF for NGC 1624 shown in Fig. 19 (solid line), yields a slope 0.30 \u00b1 0.06 for the range\nK = 13.5 - 17.5 mag, which is slightly lower than the average value of slopes (\u03b1 \u223c 0.4) for\nyoung clusters of similar ages (Lada et al. 1991; Lada & Lada 1995; Lada & Lada 2003).\nHowever, a break in the power law can be noticed at K = 15.75 mag and the KLF seems to\nbe flat in the magnitude range 15.75 - 17.5. The slope of the KLF in the magnitude range\n13.5 - 15.75 (dahsed line in Fig. 19) comes out to be 0.44 \u00b1 0.11 which is comparable with\nthe average value of slopes for young clusters. A turn off in the KLF has also been observed\nin a few young clusters. e.g., at K \u223c 14.5 mag and K \u223c 16.0 mag in the case of Tr 14\n(distance \u223c 2.5 Kpc; Sanchawala et al. 2007) and NGC 7538 (distance \u223c 2.8 Kpc; Ojha et\nal. 2004), respectively.\nKLF slope is an age indicator of young clusters. For clusters up to 10 Myr old, the KLF\nslope gets steeper as the cluster gets older (Ali & Depoy 1995; Lada & Lada 1995). However,\nthere is no precise age - KLF relationship in the literature due to huge uncertainty in their\n\n\fYoung cluster NGC 1624\n\n27\n\ncorrelation (Devine et al. 2008). There are many studies on KLF of young clusters. The\nstudies by Blum et al. 2000; Figuer\u00eado et al. 2002; Leistra et al. 2005; 2006; Devine at al.\n2008 indicate that the KLF slope varies from 0.2 -0.4 for clusters younger than 5 Myr. The\nKLF of NGC 1624 is worth comparing with the recent studies of young clusters viz; NGC\n1893 (Sharma et al. 2007), Be 59 (Pandey et al. 2008) and Stock 8 (Jose et al. 2008), since\nall the KLFs are obtained using a similar technique. The slope of the KLF (\u03b1 = 0.30 \u00b1 0.06)\nobtained for NGC 1624 in the magnitude range 13.5 - 17.5 is comparable with those obtained\nfor NGC 1893 (\u03b1 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.07), Stock 8 (\u03b1 = 0.31 \u00b1 0.02) and Be 59 (\u03b1 = 0.27 \u00b1 0.02).\n\n11\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have carried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the young cluster NGC 1624\nassociated with the H ii region Sh2-212. Sh2-212 is thought to have experienced 'Champagne\nflow' and the molecular clumps along with the UCH ii region at the periphery are suggested\nas the possible outcome of the collect and collapse phenomena. In our present study, an\nattempt has been made to determine the basic properties of NGC 1624 as well as to study\nthe nature of stellar contents in the region using optical UBV RI photometry, optical spectroscopy of four stars, radio continuum observations from GMRT along with NIR JHK\narchival data from 2MASS and CFHT.\nFrom optical observations of massive stars, reddening (E(B \u2212V )) in the direction of NGC\n1624 is found to vary between 0.76 to 1.00 mag and distance is estimated to be 6.0 \u00b1 0.8\nkpc. The maximum post-main-sequence age of the cluster is estimated as \u223c 4 Myr. Present\nspectroscopic analysis of the ionizing source indicates a spectral class of O6.5V. We used\nJHK colour criteria to identify sources with NIR excess and found 120 candidate YSOs in\nthe region. Majority of the YSOs have AV 6 4.0 mag and masses in the range \u223c 0.1 - 3.0\nM\u2299 . Distribution of these YSOs on the CMD indicates an age spread of \u223c 0.5 - 5 Myr with\nan average age of \u223c 2-3 Myr, suggesting non-coeval star formation in NGC 1624. The lower\nlimit for the NIR excess fraction on the basis of JHK data is found to be \u223c 20% which\nindicates an average age \u223c 2 - 3 Myr for YSOs in NGC 1624. From the radio continuum\nflux, spectral type of the ionizing source of the UCH ii region is estimated to be \u223c B0.5V.\nA significant number of YSOs are located close to the cluster centre and a few YSOs are\nseen to be located/projected over the molecular clumps detected by Deharveng et al. (2008),\nas well as farther away from the clumps. We detect an enhanced density of reddened YSOs\n\n\f28\n\nJose et al.\n\nlocated/projected close to the molecular clump C2. The NIR excess and (H \u2212 K) colour\ndistribution of these sources show indication of an age sequence in the sense that the YSOs\nlocated/projected near the clump C2 are younger than those located within the cluster core.\nThe slope of the MF, \u0393, derived from optical data, in the mass range 1.2 6 M/M\u2299 < 27\ncan be represented by -1.18 \u00b1 0.10. Whereas NIR data, in the mass range 0.65 6 M/M\u2299 < 27\nyields \u0393 = -1.31 \u00b1 0.15. Thus MF fairly agrees with the Salpeter value (-1.35). Slope of the\nKLF for NGC 1624 in the magnitude range 13.5 - 17.5 is found to be 0.30 \u00b1 0.06 which is\nsmaller than the average value (\u223c0.4) obtained for young clusters of similar ages (Lada et\nal. 1991; Lada & Lada 1995; Lada & Lada 2003), however, agrees well with the values 0.27\n\u00b1 0.02 for Be 59 (Pandey et al. 2008); 0.34 \u00b1 0.07 for NGC 1893 (Sharma et al. 2007) and\n0.31 \u00b1 0.02 for Stock 8 (Jose et al. 2008). However, there is a clear indication of break in\nthe power law at K =15.75 mag. The KLF slope in the magnitude range 13.5 - 15.75 can\nbe represented by \u03b1 = 0.44 \u00b1 0.11 and the KLF slope is found to be flat in the magnitude\nrange 15.75 - 17.5.\n\n12\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nAuthors are thankful to the referee Dr. Antonio Delgado for his useful comments which has\nimproved contents and presentation of the paper significantly.

The locus for dwarfs (thin solid curve) and giants (thick solid curve) are from\nBessell & Brett (1988). The dotted and dotted-dashed lines (red and green, respectively in the online version) represent the\nunreddened and reddened (AV = 4.0 mag) locus of CTTSs (Meyer et al. 1997). Dashed straight lines represent the reddening\nvectors (Cohen et al. 1981). The crosses on the dashed lines are separated by AV = 5 mag. The plots are classified in to three\nregions, 'F', 'T' and 'P'. The sources located in the 'F' region are likely to be the reddened field stars, WTTSs or CTTSs with\nlittle or no NIR excess. The sources in the 'T' region are considered to be candidate CTTSs with NIR excess and sources in the\n'P' region are the candidate Class I objects (see text for details).
