INTRODUCTION\nSuperconductivity above 20 K in iron pnictides was reported two years\nago.[1] Since then the number of iron-pnictide phases has grown considerably,\nbut the highest critical temperature has remained below 60 K. However,\nthe value falls short only of that of the high-Tc superconductive cuprates.\n\u2217\n\nCorresponding author. E-mail address: jlinden@abo.fi\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nAugust 16, 2018\n\n\fNonetheless, Fe as a natural constituent in superconductive materials is fascinating and somewhat unexpected. In none of these iron-pnictide phases\ndoes iron order magnetically in the superconductive state, though some\nnon-superconductive parent phases exhibit antiferromagnetic spin-density\nwaves.[2] Some of the superconductive iron phases have simple structures,\ne.g. the chalcogenide phase FeSe.[3] Like the high-Tc cuprate superconductors Fe-based phases also have layered structures, in which the superconducting charge carriers reside at edge-shared FeX4 (X = Group 15 or 16\nelement) tetrahedra. The geometry is important for both types of superconductive phases. Cuprate superconductors with puckered CuO2 layers have\ngenerally lower Tc values than those with flat ones, whereas for the Fe-based\nsuperconductors the highest Tc values occur when the tetrahedra are closest\nto the regular shape.[4] In a recent work which incorporates also FeSe the\ndistance between the X atom and the nearest Fe layer seems to be a crucial\ngeometrical parameter for determining the Tc value.[5] However, the actual\nmechanism behind the superconductivity transition is not known yet.\nThe presence of Fe has opened the possibility to perform 57 Fe-M\u00f6ssbauerspectroscopy measurements and thereby to determine the spin and valence\nstate of the Fe atoms. Various spectra from superconductive samples have\nestablished that the spin state of Fe is zero or close to zero.[6, 7] This is\ntrue at least within the characteristic time-scale of \u223c 100 ns of the 57 Fe\ntransition. However, presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations has been\nsuggested[8, 9] but may be difficult to be detected by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy.\nA recent high-pressure experiment on the LaFeAsO phase showed that there\nis a strong connection between the spin-density-wave type magnetism of the\nnon-superconducting state and the seemingly zero-Fe-spin spectra of the superconducting state.[10]\nIn this work we report findings of the M\u00f6ssbauer and Seebeck measurements performed on both sides of the critical temperature of FeSe0.5 Te0.5 to\nrecord possible changes in the hyperfine parameters upon passing Tc .\n2. Experimental\nSamples of the FeSe0.5 Te0.5 phase were synthesized from stoichiometric\nratios of high-purity Se (99.99%), Fe (99.9%) and Te (99.8%) powders. The\npowders were sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube and fired for 20 h at 600\n\u25e6\nC. After an intermediate grinding the samples were fired again at 650 \u25e6 C\nfor 20 h and furnace-cooled down to 300 K.\n2\n\n\fBulk superconductivity was confirmed by measuring the diamagnetic signal from approximately 20 mg of the sample with a superconducting quantum\ninterference device (SQUID: Quantum Design, MPMS-XL) in both the zero\nfield-cooled and field-cooled (10 Oe) regimes.\nX-ray diffraction patterns were measured in an ordinary \u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b8 geometry\nusing Cu K\u03b11 radiation (PanAnalytical X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer) to\ncheck the sample purity. Rietveld analysis was done to confirm the tetragonal\nP4/nmm structure of superconductive \u03b2-FeSe phase.\nThe M\u00f6ssbauer measurements were carried out using a 25 mCi 57 Co:Rh\nsource (Cyclotron Co, purchased in April 2009) at fixed temperatures between 6.0 and 320 K, in transmission geometry with a maximum Doppler\nvelocity of 3.0 mm/s. Additional measurements using maximum Doppler velocities of 8 and 10 mm/s were done to check the presence of magnetic impurities. Cooling of the sample was achieved with an Oxford CF506 continuousflow cryostat with liq. N2 and liq. He as cooling agents. With the amount\nof He allocated for the measurements spectra from 6.0 to 30 K could be collected, leaving the interval of 30 - 77 K uncovered. The two main components\nof the spectra were fitted using the chemical isomer shift relative to \u03b1-Fe (\u03b4),\nthe relative intensity (I), the quadrupole coupling constant (eQVzz ), and the\nresonance line width (\u0393) which was constrained to be equal for all components. A weak magnetic component due to magnetite was observed, but\nwas left unfitted in most spectra as the most intensive lines were outside the\n\u00b13-mm/s velocity range.\nSeebeck measurements were done (using a self-made equipment) upon\nheating the sample from 4.0 to 300 K in steps of \u223c 0.3 K. A sintered sample\nspecimen was ground into shape of a thin parallelepiped of 2.0\u00d71.5\u00d70.3 mm3\nand inserted between two Cu sample holders using Ag paste. A resistor\nhidden inside one of the Cu holders was heated to achieve a temperature\ngradient up to \u223c 1.5 K over the sample. Additional Seebeck data in applied\nfields of 0 and 8 T were collected using a physical-property measurement\nsystem (Quantum Design, PPMS) equipped with a self-made sample puck.\nThe same sample as above was used.\n3. Results and Discussion\nFigure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern for the FeSe0.5 Te0.5 sample.\nIt is readily indexed by the PbO-type tetragonal structure of space group\nP4/nmm (isostructural with \u03b2\u2212FeSe). Impurity peaks assigned mainly to\n3\n\n\fhexagonal Te-substituted \u03b4-FeSe[6] and/or Fe7 Se8 are observed. Additionally, presence of Fe3 O4 , confirmed by SQUID and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy\nmeasurements, is seen.\nThe magnetization-versus-temperature data obtained by SQUID measurements in the field-cooled and zero-field-cooled regimes confirm onset of\nbulk superconductivity at 12.5 K for the FeSe0.5 Te0.5 sample, see the inset in\nFig. 1. The positive background is due to the presence of magnetic impurity\nphases, i.e. Fe3 O4 . The Verwey transition[11] of Fe3 O4 at \u223c 120 K is also\nseen in the susceptibility data.\nThe Seebeck data are shown in Fig. 2. The negative sign indicates that the\nsample is an n-type conductor. Below the transition into the superconducting\nstate the Seebeck coefficient becomes zero at 10.6 K. Above \u223c 135 K positive\nvalues for the Seebeck coefficient are obtained. Using an external field of 8 T\nthe low-temperature Seebeck data are clearly shifted by \u223c 1 K towards lower\ntemperatures. The shift is in accord with the rather high second critical field\nHc2 . Similar results were reported in Ref. [12] for samples of Fe1+x Te1\u2212y Sey .\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectra obtained from FeSe0.5 Te0.5 at selected temperatures\nare shown in Fig. 3. Components due to two phases are readily observed.\nThe paramagnetic main component covering 88% of the spectral intensity is\ndue to FeSe0.5 Te0.5 (Component 1). It has an isomer shift of \u223c 0.43 mm/s\nat 300 K and a quadrupole splitting of eQVzz /2 = 0.28 mm/s, i.e. similar to\nthe values obtained for \u03b2\u2212FeSe,[6] but eQVzz was somewhat larger, reflecting a higher deformation of the coordination tetrahedron around Fe upon\nintroducing Te.[13] Another paramagnetic component (Component 2) with\n\u03b4 \u2248 0.36 mm/s covers \u223c 9% of the spectral intensity. It has a quadrupole\nsplitting of 0.16 mm/s. In the XRD pattern for a \u03b2\u2212FeSe sample peak positions due to \u03b4-FeSe/Fe7 Se8 impurities are observed.[6] When comparing the\npattern with that of the present FeSe0.5 Te0.5 sample almost identical impurity peaks are observed, indicating that Component 2 is due to Te-substituted\nFe7 Se8 or \u03b4-FeSe. Fe7 Se8 is magnetically ordered at room-temperature, but\nthe absence of magnetic order is in accord with the fact that Te substitution\nis detrimental for the magnetic order in the Fe-Se system. [14] In a highvelocity spectrum (not shown) \u223c 4% of Fe3 O4 can be discerned. No other\nmagnetic phases were observed.\nAs Component 2 interferes with Component 1 we tried the following three\nfitting schemes when analyzing the spectra of the most interesting region (6100 K): (i) Releasing all fit parameters of Components 1 and 2, (ii) Fixing the\npeak height and quadrupole coupling constant of Component 2 to an average\n4\n\n\fINTENSITY (a.u.)\n\nsusceptibility (a.u.)\n\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nTEMPERATURE (K)\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n2\u03b8\nFigure 1: (color online) X-ray diffraction pattern for the FeSe0.5 Te0.5 sample.

The components used in the fitting are displayed above each data\n\n\fof the T < 100 K region and (iii) Fixing the isomer shift and quadrupole coupling constant of Component 2 to an average value of the T < 100 K region.\nThe general features as presented below for Component 1 did not depend\non the choice of scheme. Fitting scheme (iii) gave the \"purest\" behavior, as\nno specific temperature evolution was expected for the impurity component,\nexcept that its peak height should vary as a function of the temperature,\nwhich was violated by scheme (ii). In the end, we decided to present the\nresults as obtained according to scheme (i), in order to avoid excessive fixing\nof fit parameters.\nThe isomer shift (\u03b4) of Component 1 in FeSe0.5 Te0.5 is plotted against\ntemperature in Fig. 4. The shift obtained from the fitting includes contributions from both the chemical shift and the second-order Doppler shift, which\nis known to increase convexely upon decreasing temperature, due to gradual\ndepopulation of the excited phonon states.[15] However, it should be constant\nat low temperatures, because of the quantum mechanical zero-point motion.\nThe chemical shift should not depend on temperature. An ordinary convex\ntemperature evolution is indeed traced down to Tc where a distinct drop is\nobserved. The drop indicates that the Debye temperature (\u03b8D ) is decreasing,\nthat is the lattice undergoes a softening. The actual size of the drop can\nonly be estimated, as there is no leveling-off visible at 6 K. The temperature\ndependence for \u03b4 is given by:[16]\n9kB \u03b8D 9kB T\n\u03b4(T ) = \u03b40 +\n\u2212\n16Mc\n2Mc\n\n\u0012\n\nT\n\u03b8D\n\n\u00133 Z\n\n0\n\n\u03b8D\nT\n\nx3 dx\n,\nex \u2212 1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c is the velocity of light, kB the Boltzmann constant, M the mass of the\n57\nFe atom, and \u03b40 the temperature-independent part, i.e the chemical shift. A\nfit with Eq. 1 to the data of Fig. 4 yields \u03b8D = 460(5) K and \u03b40 = 0.43 mm/s.\nBy fixing \u03b40 at the values 0.43 mm/s and setting \u03b8D = 400 K the softening of\nthe lattice is readily visualized: The drop in the second-order Doppler shift\nof at least \u2206vSOD = \u22120.013 mm/s corresponds to a drop of \u2206\u03b8D = 60 K in\nthe Debye temperature (the lower curve in Fig. 4).\nThe drop in \u03b8D is also visible in the total absorption (A) for Component\n1, given as the component intensity I times the line width \u0393, as shown in\nFig. 5. The drop in absorption begins slightly above Tc . A softening of the\nlattice will decrease the recoil-free fraction and hence the absorption will\nalso decrease.

Because of possible sample-thickness corrections the absorption data\ncan only be used for qualitatively estimating \u03b8D and the drop at Tc . The\nstandard expression for the recoil-free fraction f is given by:[17]\n\"\n#\n\u0012 \u00132 Z \u03b8D\nT\n6ER 1\nxdx\nT\nln f = \u2212\n,\n(2)\n+\nx\nkB \u03b8D 4\n\u03b8D\ne \u22121\n0\nwhere the recoil energy ER = 0.0019 eV for the 14.4 keV \u03b3 quantum of\nFe. The absorption data of Fig. 5 should be proportional to the recoil-free\nfraction in the absorber, i.e. A = Cf , where C is a parameter depending\non the sample thickness, signal-to-noise ratio for the detected \u03b3 quanta etc.\nThus:\nln A = ln f \u2212 ln C.\n(3)\n57\n\nEq. 3 is plotted together with the experimental ln(A) data against temperature in Fig. 6. The data below 77 K where parameter C is no longer\nconstant are omitted in Fig 6 because of the leveling-off of absorption data.\nThe slope of the curve strongly depends on the Debye temperature. The best\nfit was obtained for \u03b8D = 260(5) K, which is much lower than the estimate\nbased on the second-order Doppler shift. In fact, due to possible \"hidden\"\ntemperature-dependence in parameter C, the \u03b8D = 460 K is likely to be more\nreliable.\nAt low temperatures Eq. 2 for the recoil-free fraction can be approximated\nwith:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n3ER\n.\n(4)\nf \u2248 exp \u2212\n2kB \u03b8D\n\nUpon inserting the estimated \u03b8D = 260 K in Eq. 4 the recoil-free fraction\nbefore the drop is estimated at f = 0.881. About Tc the absorption (shown\nin Fig. 5) drops from 5.63 to 5.45, which corresponds to a drop in f from\n0.881 to 0.853. Upon inserting the latter into Eq. 4 we get \u03b8D = 208 K,\nresulting in a drop of \u223c 50 K in \u03b8D . If the 460-K estimate is used the recoilfree factors before and after the drop are 0.93 and 0.90, respectively and the\ncorresponding drop in \u03b8D is 140 K.\nThe quadrupole splitting of Component 1 (not shown) increases from\neQVzz /2 = 0.28 mm/s to 0.33 mm/s as temperature is decreased below 100 K.\nA leveling-off at 0.33 mm/s, possible followed by a tiny drop of 0.01 mm/s\naround Tc is observed. A small relaxation in the position of Fe or Se/Te\natoms is all that is needed to cause a change in eQVzz .

That is, it is\nextremely sensitive to movements of the atoms. The movements need not to\nbe commensurable, as the M\u00f6ssbauer-resonant nuclei act as a local probes.\nWe have also synthesized samples of the \u03b2-FeSe phase and observed a\nparallel drop in \u03b8D about its Tc \u2248 8.0 K.[19] We recently reported drops\nin both the isomer shift and the absorption below Tc = 15 K for the superconducting LiFeAs phase.[18] In this phase the drops were preceded by\na lattice stiffening, giving the low-temperature absorption and isomer-shift\ncurves concave shapes. Generally some change in the lattice stiffness, upon\npassing Tc , might indicate that the BCS mechanism of phonon-mediated coupling between the superconducting charge carriers are active. However, the\npresent lattice softening could be the result of other mechanisms as well.\nIn particular, antiferromagnetic fluctuations about Tc have been observed in\nsome of the iron-based pnictide and chalcogenide phases by inelastic neutron\nscattering, cf. Refs. [8, 20]. A possible connection between such fluctuations\nand the lattice softening was in fact suggested recently.[21] At the same\ntime inelastic X-ray-scattering experiments point towards the importance of\nphonons in these phases.[22, 23]\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n57\n\nFe M\u00f6ssbauer measurements of the FeSe0.5 Te0.5 phase reveal a paramagnetic quadrupole doublet with an isomer shift compatible with zero spin\nFe2+ . Upon decreasing the temperature below Tc = 12.5 K a softening of\nthe lattice occurs. The softening corresponds to about 60 K decrease in the\nDebye temperature from its original value of \u223c 460 K as determined by the\nisomer-shift vs. temperature data.\n5. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMr M.
