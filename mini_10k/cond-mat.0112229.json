INTRODUCTION\n(2)\n\nKnowledge of the two\u2013point correlation functions gij (r) of a polymer chain provides one with profound statistical\ninformation on the internal structure of the conformation1 as well as a direct way for computing numerous pair\u2013\nwise observables of interest: mean energy E, mean\u2013squared distances between monomers Dij , mean\u2013squared radius of\ngyration R2g , static structure factor S(p), and many others. While some of these observables permit direct experimental\nmeasurement and simple evaluation at the level of mean\u2013field theories, the whole range of information contained in\nthe pair correlation functions is only accessible in part to the most sophisticated of modern polymer theories1\u20133 . On\nthe other hand, computer simulations based on Monte Carlo Metropolis technique, if performed on a large enough\n(2)\nscale for gathering sufficiently large statistics, can yield accurate values of gij (ri ) on a given spherical mesh ri via\ncomputing histograms of monomer occurrences in spherical layers around other monomers.\nConsiderable simulational effort in this area4\u20138 has been largely inspired by the predictions of the universal scaling\nbehaviour in the field theoretical approaches (e.g. based on the de Gennes' n \u2192 0 formalism) developed by J. de\nCloizeaux1,9 , B. Duplantier10,11 and some others12,13 . As simulations have grown larger, the agreement with the\ntheoretically computed exponents has improved to a satisfactory level4,5 . Many results, however, were only known for\nan open homopolymer chain in the repulsive regime (good solvent), apart from the exact case of the Gaussian chain.\n\n\u2217\n\nCorresponding author. Internet: http://darkstar.ucd.ie; E-mail: Edward.Timoshenko@ucd.ie\n\n1\n\n\fIn the current work we shall undertake a more systematic study of the pair correlation functions and related\nobservables for polymers of varying length in a wide range of the degree of polymerisation N = 100 \u2212 700 units; with\neither open, ring or star (with different numbers of arms f = 3, 6, 9, 12) architectures; with flexible or semi\u2013flexible\n(with stiffness \u03bb = 1, 5) chain; as well as for the cases of good and poor solvents.\nGenerally, the introduction of a more complex chain architecture, stiffness, or attraction, would pose a serious\nchallenge for field\u2013theoretic formulations and renormalisation group calculations, and hence only a few scaling results\nare known for the correlation functions in such cases. Moreover, the SO(n)-\u03c64 field theory, which relates to the\npolymer diagrams, was previously only studied up to several loops1,13 . Recently, however, new results up to seven\nloops have been reported in d = 3 dimensions14 . These, by themselves, would not necessarily yield a better precision\nbecause of poor asymptotic convergence of the series, but aided by the Borel\u2013resummation renormalisation group\ntechniques, the convergence can be dramatically improved and errors in the exponents reduced. Thus, it is important\nto re\u2013examine the agreement of the theory with simulations even in the previously studied case of an open flexible coil,\nas well as to investigate other architectures. Bearing in mind that the theoretical scalings only apply for sufficiently\nlong chains, it is also instructive to analyse the data for different chain lengths, and to study dependencies on various\nmodel parameters generally to address the degree of universality in the scaling laws.\nII. MODEL\n\nThe current coarse\u2013grained homopolymer model is based on the following Hamiltonian (energy functional)15\u201317 in\nterms of the monomer coordinates, Xi :\nH=\n\nkB T X\nkB T X\n\u03baij (Xi \u2212 Xj )2 +\n\u03bbijk (Xi + Xk \u2212 2Xj )2\n2\n2l i\u223cj\n2l2\ni\u2248j\u2248k\n\n1 X\n1 X\nV (|Xi \u2212 Xj |) \u2261\nHij (|Xi \u2212 Xj |).\n+\n2\n2\nij, i6=j\n\n(1)\n\nij, i6=j\n\nHere the first term represents the connectivity structure of the polymer with harmonic springs of a given strength\n\u03baij introduced between any pair of connected monomers (which is denoted by i \u223c j). The second term represents\nthe bending energy penalty given by the square of the local curvature with a characteristic stiffness \u03bbijk between any\nthree consecutively connected monomers (which is denoted by i \u2248 j \u2248 k) in the form of the Kratky\u2013Harris\u2013Hearst\nterm18 . Finally, the third term represents pair\u2013wise non\u2013bonded interactions between monomers such as the van der\nWaals forces and so on. In a simple homopolymer model we can adopt the Lennard\u2013Jones of the potential,\n(\n+\u221e,\nr<d\n\u0010 \u000112\n\u0001 \u0011\nV (r) =\n,\n(2)\nd\nd 6\nV0 r\n, r>d\n\u2212 r\n\nwhere there is also a hard core part with the monomer diameter d (below we choose d = l without any lack of\ngenerality).\nWe use the Monte Carlo technique with the standard Metropolis algorithm19 , which converges to the Gibbs equilibrium ensemble, based upon the implementation described by us in Ref. 16. Simulations were performed for an\nensemble of 250 (or 50 \u2212 100 when additional symmetries of the system were present) of independently generated\ninitial conditions, each of which has been first equilibrated by typically 20 N 3 of attempted Monte Carlo steps. To\nensure proper equilibration, the long\u2013 and short\u2013time behaviour of the global observables, such as e.g. the E and R2g ,\nwas monitored, as these cease to have a global drift and start exhibiting characteristic fluctuating behaviour around\nwell defined mean values upon reaching the equilibrium state for given values of the interaction parameters. After\nreaching the equilibrium, 1000 of statistical measurements for each initial condition have been performed. These\nmeasurements were separated by typically 40 N 2 of attempted Monte Carlo steps in between to ensure statistical independence of sampling. Thus, overall the averaging statistics was of order Q = 105 in all cases. The mean\npvalue and\nPQ\nerror of sampling of an observable A are then given by the arithmetic mean hAi = (1/Q) \u03b3 A\u03b3 and by \u00b1 (\u2206A)2 /Q\nrespectively. For more details on our Monte Carlo technique we refer to the previous papers Refs. 16,17.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\n\nThe intra\u2013chain correlation function of a pair of monomers i and j is defined as,\n2\n\n\f(2)\n\ngij (r) \u2261\n\n\u001c\n\n\u001d\n\u03b4(Xi \u2212 Xj \u2212 r) =\n\n\u001c\n\u001d\n1\n\u03b4(|X\n\u2212\nX\n|\n\u2212\nr)\n.\ni\nj\n4\u03c0r2\n\n(3)\n\nThe second equation establishes that it is a function of radius r = |r| only due to spatial isotropy (SO(3) rotational\nsymmetry). We may note that this function should, strictly speaking, be named distribution function, but since\n(2)\n(2)\ngij (r) \u2192 0 when r \u2192 \u221e because of the chain connectivity, we apply the term 'correlation function' to gij (r) itself\n(2)\n\nrather than to the quantity gij (r)/(g (1) )2 \u2212 1, which would vanish as r \u2192 \u221e in the case of simple liquids. The\nR\n(2)\nfunction is normalised to unity via: d3 r gij (r) = 1. Note that the correlation functions exactly satisfy the excluded\nvolume condition,\n(2)\n\ngij (r) = 0\n\nfor r < d,\n\ndue to the choice of the hard\u2013core part in the non\u2013bonded potential Eq.

CORRELATION FUNCTIONS\nA. Flexible ring polymers\n\nRing polymers are the simplest objects of study since they possess exact translational invariance along the chain,\nso that all single\u2013point observables are constants and all pair\u2013wise observables are functions of the separation in the\n(2)\n(2)\nchain indices n = |i \u2212 j| rather than of both indices16 , i.e. Dij = D0n , gij (r) = g0n (r).\nIn Fig. 1 we exhibit the mean\u2013squared distances Dn of flexible ring homopolymers vs the separation n. There is\nan additional symmetry property of rings such that Dn is also symmetric with respect to the middle (i.e. maximal\nseparation along the chain), namely Dn = DN \u2212n . This function has a characteristic bell\u2013shape (which would become\nsomewhat deformed in case of semi\u2013flexible polymers), and this shape agrees very well with that from the Gaussian\nSelf\u2013Consistent (GSC) method (see e.g. Fig. 2a in Ref. 16). This function also appears to possess an approximate\nscaling transformation property, so that curves with different N can be superimposed into each other by the transformations: n\u0302 = n/N , D\u0302n\u0302 = Dn /N 2\u03bdF , where \u03bdF \u2248 3/5 is the value of the Flory swelling exponent. Such rescaled\nquantities D\u0302n\u0302 are shown in Fig. 2 for both the coil (in a good solvent) and the globule (in a poor solvent). For\nthe coil, D\u0302n\u0302 coincide with each other very closely everywhere except around the middle of the range |0.5 \u2212 n\u0302| <\n\u223c 0.2,\nwhere such agreement is less accurate. However, without rescaling, Dn is strongly dependent on both n and N . The\ndependence on N is relatively weak only for n corresponding to a few polymer links, where connectivity is directly\nmanifested.\n(2)\nSimilarly, without rescaling, the intra\u2013chain pair correlation functions gn (r) are strongly dependent on both n and\nN . However, if we introduce the rescaled pair correlation function in terms of the dimensionless variables,\n(2)\n\n3/2\n\n\u011dij (r\u0302) \u2261 Dij\n\n(2)\n\ngij (r) ,\n\nr\u0302 \u2261\n\nr\n1/2\nDij\n\n,\n\n(14)\n(2)\n\nthese would permit much more straightforward comparison with each other. Note that \u011dij (r\u0302) satisfies the following\ntwo normalisation conditions:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\n(2)\n2 (2)\n.\n(15)\ndr\u0302 r\u03024 \u011dij (r\u0302) =\ndr\u0302 r\u0302 \u011dij (r\u0302) =\n4\u03c0\n0\n0\n(2)\n\nThus, in Fig. 3 we present \u011dn (r\u0302) for n corresponding to the half\u2013ring chain separation for different values of\nthe degree of polymerisation N . It is important to emphasise that the dashed curve here corresponds to a different\nconnectivity constant and this will be discussed later on. The two lower curves coincide with each other remarkably\nwell, except for very small values of r\u0302, which are affected by the hard\u2013core part of volume interactions in the area\n(2)\nof direct steric repulsion r \u2243 d (see also Eq. (4). The same is true of \u011dn (r\u0302) curves corresponding to different chain\n\u2020\n<\nseparations n, except very small values of n \u223c n \u2243 5 for which Dn is of order of several d2 units, i.e. where Dn d2 >\n\u223c 1.\nWe may remark that at such very small n any particular polymer model (e.g. bead\u2013and\u2013anharmonic\u2013springs one\nor a freely\u2013jointed one) would in any case exhibit its model\u2013specific features, and hence would no longer produce a\nuniversal behaviour.\nOne can see that the function \u011d (2) (r\u0302) is non\u2013monotonic: it increases for small r\u0302, reaches a maximum at around\nr\u0302 \u2243 1/2 and then decreases in a Gaussian\u2013like manner, being almost zero for r\u0302 >\n\u223c 2. The short\u2013distance behaviour,\nwhich is often called the correlation hole13 , is an effect of the excluded volume interactions coming from repulsions\nmediated through higher than direct binary contacts described by Eq. (4).\nFrom this interpretation one would expect that the\u221a correlation hole size should decrease upon decreasing the\nexcluded volume size d relative to the Kuhn length l/ \u03ba. This is indeed the case as can be seen from the dashed\ncurve in Fig. 3, which has been obtained for a polymer with a twice weaker spring constant \u03ba. The correlation hole\nsize decreases, and the value of \u011d (2) there correspondingly increases to keep the normalisation condition and hence the\nfunction reaches the maximum earlier. The effect is the opposite at distances r\u0302 \u2243 1, but much weaker, and the tail at\nlarger r\u0302 is practically unaffected by this change of connectivity parameter. We would like to emphasise that while the\nchange in the correlation hole with the Kuhn length is quite dramatic, it is by no means unexpected. Evidently, as\nmuch weaker springs are considered (with d fixed), we should approach the Gaussian law for the correlation function,\n(2)\n\u011dn \u221d exp(\u22123 r\u03022 /2), as well as for the mean\u2013squared distances, and the effect of cross\u2013over behaviour is indeed so\nclearly seen in Fig. 3.\n\n4\n\n\fB. Globule of a ring chain\n\nAfter collapse of the coil, the mean\u2013squared distances Dn of the globule at the van der Waals attraction V0 = 6 kB T\nare shown in Fig. 4 vs the chain separation n for different chain lengths N . These functions increase rapidly at small\nn, quickly reaching a stable plateau scaling as Dn \u223c N 2/3 at n \u223c n\u2217 \u223c N 2/3 . The plateau is related to the nearly\nconstant density within the globule. The shapes of Dn in Fig. 4 agree with those from the GSC method (see solid\nline in Fig. 2a in Ref. 16 and curve marked LLG in Fig. 2 in Ref. 25).\nRescaled curves D\u0302n\u0302 = N \u22122/3 Dn\u0302 vs n\u0302 = n/N in Fig. 2 lie fairly close to each other. With increasing N the plateau\nheight in D\u0302n\u0302 slightly decreases,\nreaching its asymptotic value as the cross\u2013over scale vanishes: n\u0302\u2217 \u223c N \u22121/3 \u2192 0, so\nP\nthat the normalisation n\u0302<1 D\u0302n\u0302 = R2g N \u22122/3 remains constant.\n(2)\n\nIn Fig. 5 we present the rescaled correlation functions \u011dn (r\u0302) of the globule for several different values of n. These,\nfor small r\u0302, have several peaks of increasing width and decreasing height located at integer multiples of the excluded\nvolume diameter r = d n, which is similar to the behaviour of correlation functions in simple liquids26 . For large r\u0302 this\n(2)\n\u2217\nbehaviour changes into a monotonically decreasing tail. All functions \u011dn (r\u0302) for chain separations |N/2 \u2212 n| >\n\u223cn ,\n(2)\nwhere n\u2217 is the same cross\u2013over index as in Dn , lie very close to each other and to the half\u2013ring function \u011dN/2 (r\u0302).\nThus, as long as the chain separations n are not directly affected by the chain connectivity, the idea of a single master\nfunction in terms of the dimensionless variables is still valid for the globule, although the function is much more\n(2)\n(2)\ncomplicated than for the coil. This is consistent with the fact that peaks in gn (r) occur at r = d n, so that for \u011dn (r\u0302)\n\u2217\nto fall onto a single function Dn has to become n-independent, which indeed happens beyond n .\n(2)\nImportantly, the curves \u011dn do not fall onto a single master curve for different chain lengths N here. Indeed,\n(2)\nthe number of peaks in \u011dn can be estimated as proportional to the linear size of the globule, which is of order\n\u221d N 1/3 . Thus, for a very large N we shall have a function containing a sharp and narrow first peak followed by\nmany oscillations decreasing in amplitude around a constant level (related to the constancy of the density inside the\nglobule) and ended by a monotonically decreasing tail.\nC. Open chain\n\nRescaled correlation functions of an open chain are presented in Fig. 6. The ring symmetry no longer applies here, so\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nthat \u011dij (r\u0302) now explicitly depends on both chain indices. We note that the reflection symmetry gN +1\u2212i,N +1\u2212j = gij\nis the only exact symmetry of an open chain. Thus, in obtaining the correlation functions, we may average over two\npossibilities for the end\u2013internal and\n\u221a internal\u2013internal correlations. As for the end\u2013end correlation function only single\npossibility exists hence leading to 2 times worse statistics in this case. Since the averaging statistics is the worst for\nan open chain as compared to other architectures considered in this paper, we present the correlation functions here\nvia data points and smooth curves approximating them (this will be discussed in more detail in Sec. V).\nClearly, the end monomers have a special r\u00f4le due to entropic reasons, but correlations of internal monomers on\nlarge separations within a very long chain should behave in a similar manner to those of an equivalent ring. Indeed,\n(2)\nthe function \u011dN/4,3N/4 (r\u0302) (denoted by dotted line in Fig. 6) practically coincides with that of a ring (solid line in Fig.\n3).\n(2)\nHowever, the functions involving the end monomers have distinct shapes. Short\u2013dashed curve of \u011d1,N/2 (r\u0302) has a\nhigher peak and a somewhat smaller correlation hole area than the middle\u2013middle correlation function; the trend con(2)\ntinues for the long\u2013dashed curve of \u011d1,3N/4 (r\u0302), which shows a weak cross\u2013over behaviour; and the end\u2013end correlation\n(2)\nfunction \u011d1,N (r\u0302) (solid line) has the tallest peak and the narrowest correlation hole area. Interestingly, for r\u0302 >\n\u223c 1.5 all\nfunctions still have practically identical monotonically decreasing tails.\nD. Semi\u2013flexible ring\n\nNow then, it would be interesting to understand the effect of chain stiffness determined by the \u03bbijk constants in\nEq. (1). Thus, let us consider a semi\u2013flexible ring polymer of N = 200 units with \u03bbijk = 1 for each triplet of\n(2)\nconsequently connected monomers and zero otherwise16 . In Fig. 7 we present \u011dn (r\u0302) functions for different values of\n(2)\nchain separation n. As opposed to similar functions of a flexible ring (\u03bb = 0) in Fig. 3, in this case \u011dn (r\u0302) no longer\nfall onto a single master curve.\n\n5\n\n\fA striking feature for relatively small n is the expansion of the correlation hole area at small r\u0302. The latter is now\ndetermined not only by the excluded volume interactions but also by the tendency of the chain to remain locally\nstraight via the stiffness term. The lowest curve for n = 10 in Fig. 7 shows that this effect is still present for n\nconsiderably larger than the persistence length of the chain, which is of order \u03bb. Upon increasing n the correlation\nhole shrinks, producing a steeper growth at small r\u0302, and for large enough n the hole becomes even smaller than that\nof the flexible ring. This may be understood as follows. Due to the stiffness effect neighbouring monomers along\nthe chain are being pushed away from the current monomer, thus providing an easier access for contacts with it for\n(2)\nmonomers which are more distant along the chain. The mismatch of \u011dn for different n is present also at intermediate\nvalues of r\u0302, where a complicated cross\u2013over occurs, and, unusually, even the tails of the distributions do not match\nperfectly here. Thus, stiffness completely removes the universality of rescaled correlation functions which was present\nin the flexible case for topologically equivalent monomers. Moreover, manifestations of stiffness are also strongly\nN -dependent16 and the consideration of the limit N \u2192 \u221e is highly non\u2013trivial as it would require renormalisation of\n\u03bb, which might significantly change the physical persistent length of the chain.\nE. Star polymers\n\nNow let us turn our attention to the case of flexible homopolymer stars with arm length (N \u2212 1)/f = 50. We refer\nthe reader for notations, further details and previous results on stars to our preceding work in Ref. 17.\nClearly, an open chain may be viewed as a star with f = 2 arms, so one would like to understand the effect of\nincreasing the arms number, which will be studied in Sec. V, but we shall first analyse different correlation functions\n(2)\nin a star with sufficiently large f . Thus, in Fig. 8 we present the functions \u011dij for different ij for a star with f = 12\narms in the coil state.\nStar architecture allows us to use the arms symmetry to increase averaging statistics. Therefore, it is sufficient to\nconsider correlations of three types: core\u2013arm, intra\u2013arm and inter\u2013arm. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the shapes of\n(2)\nfunctions \u011dij corresponding to these three types are very different indeed.\nThe core monomer plays a very special r\u00f4le, so the solid (core\u2013half arm) and long\u2013dashed (core\u2013end monomer)\ncurves in Fig. 8 show pronounced correlation holes at small r\u0302 due to stronger steric repulsion from the core monomer\n(2)\nas f increases. Interestingly, \u011dij grows faster at small r\u0302 in the core\u2013end case than in the core\u2013half case. This may be\nexplained by entropic reasons as it is easier for an end monomer to form a single long loop and return towards the\ncore.\nThe intra\u2013arm correlation function drawn as short\u2013dashed curve in Fig. 8 has a shape and meaning similar to that\nof the corresponding function in an open chain (short\u2013dashed curve in Fig. 6) since the core monomer and the rest of\nthe star are typically far from the part of the arm in question. Analogously, the inter\u2013arm end\u2013end correlation function\n(dotted curve in Fig. 8) has a similar shape and meaning to that of the end\u2013end function in an open chain (solid curve\nin Fig. 6), although the correlation hole is smaller in the latter case. This is because there are more possibilities for\nany two ends in a star to encounter each other than to do so for the only two ends of an open chain. This effect will\nbe numerically investigated for different f in Sec. V. Thus, correlation functions of a star are essentially ij-dependent\neven within monomers of identical topological types (i.e. inner, end or core).\nV. SCALING RELATIONS\nA. Open and ring chains\n\nIn this section we shall quantify the behaviour of rescaled correlation functions in a good solvent. According to\nRefs. 1,13 these, at least in the well known case of an open flexible chain, can be described as a power law times a\n(2)\nstretched exponential, so that we can fit \u011dij (r\u0302) there via the following function,\n\u0001\n(2)\n\u011dij (r\u0302) = Aij r\u0302\u03b8ij exp \u2212Bij r\u0302\u03b4ij .\n\n(16)\n\nFor brevity we shall suppress the ij indices bellow. Due to the two normalisation conditions in Eq. (15) constants A\nand B can be immediately calculated and expressed via \u03b8 and \u03b4:\nB=\n\n\u0393((5 + \u03b8)/\u03b4)\n,\n\u0393((3 + \u03b8)/\u03b4)\u03b4/2\n\nA=\n\n6\n\n\u03b4 B (3+\u03b8)/\u03b4\n.\n4\u03c0 \u0393((3 + \u03b8)/\u03b4)\n\n(17)\n\n\fThe exponents \u03b4 and \u03b8, which in the case of end\u2013end correlations of an open chain is denoted as \u03b80 , can be expressed\nvia,\n\u03b3\u22121\n1\n,\n\u03b80 =\n,\n(18)\n1\u2212\u03bd\n\u03bd\nwhere \u03bd has the meaning of the inverse fractal dimension of the system and \u03b3 is related to the number of different\npolymer conformations1,13 .\nWe should, strictly speaking, comment at this stage that for small distances the \u03b80 exponent should, in fact, be\nreplaced by another value ae = (1 \u2212 \u03b3 + \u03bdd \u2212 d/2)/(1 \u2212 \u03bd) = 0.249 \u00b1 0.011, but because ae is numerically very close to\n\u03b80 in d = 3 dimensions, one can use Eqs. (16,18) in a single form for all distances. Such formula is often called the\ndes Cloizeaux scaling form1,13 . This expression also works very well for other types of correlations and we shall fit\nour data via Eq. (16) below.\nThe exponents \u03b4 and \u03bd have been derived in Refs. 27,28. The theoretical values that we shall quote in this paper\nhave been updated by a higher order calculations in Ref. 14,\n\u03b4=\n\n\u03b3 = 1.1596 \u00b1 0.0020,\n\n\u03bd = 0.5882 \u00b1 0.0011.\n\n(19)\n\nThe exponents \u03b8\u03c5 , \u03c5 = 0, 1, 2 related to the probabilities of contacts of the end\u2013end, end\u2013internal and internal\u2013\ninternal monomers in an open chain respectively, have been calculated by des Cloizeaux in Ref. 9 by the renormalisation\ngroup technique based on \u03b5 = 4 \u2212 d expansion for the Euclidean field theory, as well as by Duplantier in Ref. 11 and\nOono et al in Ref. 12 based on the Edwards' model.\nIn Tab. I we present the exponents, based on fitting of our Monte Carlo data, as well as the best theoretical\nvalues known to us (the latter and the corresponding Monte Carlo values under comparison are set in bold face).\nFitting has been done via the the nonlinear least\u2013squares (NLLS) Marquardt\u2013Levenberg method29 by means of the\nfit function in the gnuplot software ver. 3.7.0. Fit reports parameter error estimates which are obtained from the\nvariance\u2013covariance matrix after the final iteration. By convention, these estimates are called 'standard errors' and\nthey have been reported in the tables.\nTwo types of fittings have been independently carried out. In one case, both \u03b4 and \u03b8 have been fitted, while in the\nother case, \u03b4 was fixed at the theoretical value and hence a more accurate estimate has been achieved. The latter\nexponent will be denoted as \u03b8\u03b4 f ix .\nOne should bear in mind the reservations that universal exponents values are only asymptotically approached as\nN increases, and that assuming the same power law for both small and large distances is only approximate. Yet, we\nfind our results in a good agreement with the best of theoretical estimates.\nFirst of all, the exponent \u03b4 in cases when fitting errors are the smallest seems quite close to \u03b4theor . The agreement\nis particularly good in case 1\u2032 , where \u03b8\u03b4 f ix is also very close to theoretical value \u03b81 . This may be in part due to\nthe fact that here the two internal monomers are well separated within the chain, reducing finite\u2013size behaviour. It\nis interesting that \u03b4 for the ring is also close to the current exponent, which indicates that as N increases the same\nuniversal exponent value should be achieved in this case also. We should comment that a somewhat longer ring\nwith N = 300 is equivalent to only a N = 150 open chain though. As for the end\u2013end case 0, it is somewhat more\nintrinsically noisy, since ends have more entropic freedom, so that the agreement with the much more accurately\nknown \u03b80 is only satisfactory.\nIn the internal\u2013internal case 2 our fitting error is rather minimal, thus our value of \u03b8\u03b4 f ix here is also very consistent\nwith the ten times more accurate result for the ring. Such improved accuracy is achieved for the ring because here\none can average over all pairs of monomers separated\n\u221a by n = |i \u2212 j| links due to the kinematic symmetry described\nabove. Thus, the error is reduced by an order of 100, which is also seen in the data. It is only natural that any\ntwo well separated internal monomers in an infinitely long open chain should behave as those of an infinitely long\nequivalent ring since an extra link between the two ends should not matter. However, the theoretical estimate for \u03b82\nis the least accurate of all, so that higher order calculations akin to those done for \u03b80 recently may be required here\ntoo.\nMoreover, here we can see a cross\u2013over effect discussed in Ref. 8 at work. By taking one monomer at the end, and\nby moving another from 1/4-chain (case 1\u2032\u2032 ) to 1/2-chain (case 1) and to 3/4-chain (case 1\u2032 ), the exponent \u03b8\u03b4 f ix\nwould steadily decrease, and as we reach the other end (case 0), the smallest value \u03b80 would be reached. The tilde in\nfront of the theoretical exponents in Tab. I indicates that those exponents are in the cross\u2013over area.\nB. Stars\n\nResults from fitting of various correlations functions for stars with different f in the manner described above are\ncollected in Tab. II. In this case, no theoretical exponents are known to us as universality is not a feature of this\n7\n\n\fsystem. Yet, it is instructive to attempt the fitting even though we realise the finite\u2013size and cross\u2013over nature of the\nresulting numbers. This should not be very off\u2013putting though as actually synthesized stars are indeed objects of a\nfew arms of very finite length at present.\nFirst of all, we find again that the stretching exponent \u03b4 agrees within fitting errors with the theoretical value for\nopen and ring chains \u03b4theor . Thus, we can concentrate on the discussion of a more accurate exponent, \u03b8\u03b4 f ix . Clearly,\nthe core monomer has a very special r\u00f4le, and as the number of arms grows, the steric repulsion around it becomes\nreally significant. This leads to a rapid expansion of the correlation hole as f changes from 3 to 12, so that values of\n\u03b8\u03b4 f ix grow rapidly with f for the correlations functions of the core with the middle and ends of arms (two first rows).\nAs for the intra\u2013arm correlations generally, these behave more and more as in an open chain as long as the monomers\nin question are away from the core. So the middle\u2013end intra\u2013arm exponents (third row) \u03b8\u03b4 f ix are fairly independent\nof f and are close in numerical values to the corresponding exponent \u03b81 of an open chain.\nNow let us discuss the inter\u2013arm exponents. The middle\u2013middle (fourth row) and end\u2013end (last row) inter\u2013arm\nexponents \u03b8\u03b4 f ix start from values close to those of the corresponding exponents of an open chain \u03b82 and \u03b80 respectively\nat f = 3, but both of them decrease significantly as number of arms f increases.

ASPHERICITY CHARACTERISTICS\n\nIn this section we would be interested to investigate the average shape of conformations, for which we have studied\nthe spherically averaged pair correlation functions above.\nThe shape tensor in Eq. (9) is merely a slight generalisation of its 3-d trace R2g in Eq. (8). However, since the space\nrotational isotropy is enforced on average, one way of obtaining a non\u2013trivial spatial information is to diagonalise the\nmatrix Q\u03b1\u03b2 for each member of the statistical ensemble and then to average some useful observables constructed out\nof its eigenvalues. Eq. (10) introduces the averages of normalised sorted eigenvalues (so that \u03bb(1) \u2265 \u03bb(2) \u2265 \u03bb(3) ),\nwhereas Eqs. (11) and (12) introduce the asphericity index A3 and the ellipsoid index S3 . The latter allows one to\nfurther distinguish a prolate ellipsoid (rod\u2013like) from an oblate one (pancake\u2013like). Finally, variables \u00c23 and \u015c3 in\nEqs. (13) introduce related fractions of averages, which although less informative are easier to compute analytically13 .\nIn Tab. III we have collected these asphericity characteristics for the systems under study. First of all, we may\nobserve that the 'ellipsoid aspect ratios' \u03bb(a) reflect the shape fairly well, although the asphericity index A3 and the\nellipsoid index S3 express it in an even more clear way. As for the observables \u00c23 and \u015c3 , they follow the trends of\nA3 and S3 respectively, although in a somewhat less sensitive manner.\nNow then, for the ring, open coil and the globule we see that the values depend little on N , if the system size is large\nenough, approaching their universal limits. The coil of a ring (first row) has a smaller asphericity and prolateness\n(rod\u2013like shape) than the corresponding values for an open chain (third row). We may note also that our values for\nan open coil are fairly close to those reported in Refs. 23,13. The semi\u2013stiff ring (fourth row) becomes, clearly, more\naspherical and prolate as stiffness \u03bb increases at fixed N . If, however, \u03bb is kept fixed, and N increases both A3 and\nS3 decrease approaching the flexible chain limit since the ratio \u03bb/N presents the relevant degree of flexibility of the\npolymer.\nThe globule of a ring (second row) is nearly perfectly spherical and only very slightly prolate, as should be expected,\nand these asymmetries diminish even further as N increases. However, at the same time, the non\u2013equality of \u03bb(a) is\nmore noticeable here, which shows that they provide less informative asphericity observables.\nFinally, stars (fifth row) starting from a fairly non\u2013spherical and prolate shape at f = 3 become significantly more\nspherical and less prolate as the number of arms f increases. This, of course, is consistent with the intuitive idea that\na star with a very large number of relatively short arms behaves as a sphere due to strong steric repulsions.\nVII. STATIC STRUCTURE FACTORS\n\nThe static structure factor (SSF) is of interest due to its relation to the light and neutron scattering techniques and\nit is standard to introduce it in the rescaled Kratky form via,\n\u015c(p\u0302) =\n\np2 R2g\nS(p),\nN\n\np\u0302 = p\n\nq\nR2g ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhich has an advantage of being less sensitive on N .\nThe factor p2 allows one to emphasise the large p behaviour more clearly. Indeed, it is well known30 that S(p) \u221d\n\u22121/\u03bd\np\nwith \u03bd = 3/5 and 1/2 for the repulsive and ideal coils respectively. Thus, \u015c(p\u0302) would be increasing, reaching\n8\n\n\fa constant asymptote, or decreasing for the repulsive coil, ideal coil and globule respectively. This is indeed the case\nin Fig. 9, where we depict \u015c(p\u0302) vs p\u0302 for various systems. Since curves for the coils (or the globule) for different N\ncoincided with each other so well due to a nearly perfect universality, we only have drawn one particular size in each\ncase.\nClearly, for small p\u0302 we have the identical behaviour30 ,\n\u015c(p\u0302) \u2243 p\u03022 (1 \u2212 p\u03022 /3 + . . .),\n\n(21)\n\nin terms of the rescaled variables in all cases. The SSF of the globule has a characteristic oscillating behaviour, which\nshows its dense structure. It is instructive to compare this with the SSF of a solid sphere30 of a radius Rs ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u00132\n\u0012\n3\nsin(R\np)\n\u2212\n(R\np)\ncos(R\np)\nS(p) =\n.\n(22)\ns\ns\ns\n(Rs p)3\nBy requiringq\nthat the cumulant law Eq. (21) is universal in terms of the rescaled variables one determines the radius\nto be Rs = (5/3)R2g . One can see in Fig. 9 that the SSF of the globule is in a perfect agreement with that of\nthe solid sphere up to the peak point. At larger p\u0302 both functions have rather similar shape, however the SSF of the\nglobule has somewhat smaller amplitude of oscillations, which reflects fluctuations in shape and size of the globule.\nAs additional analysis shows, with increasing N the minima of the rescaled SSF of the globule decrease in value, so\nthat \u015c(p\u0302) asymptotically approaches that of the solid sphere.\nThe SSF \u015c(p\u0302) of an open coil has a power\u2013law increasing behaviour, which is preserved for a ring coil as well,\nalthough the latter has a slight peak, showing a more spherical structure of a ring in accord with Sec. VI. However,\nwhen we introduce even a moderate stiffness for a ring coil, the plot of \u015c(p\u0302) starts to significantly deviate from that\nof a flexible ring, and also becomes quite N dependent. This results from the loss of master function universality in\nthe rescaled correlation functions in terms of N , which we have seen for a semi\u2013flexible coil in subsec. IV D.\nNow, if we turn our attention to the structure factors of stars with different numbers of arms in Fig. 10, we can\nsee how the starting case of f = 3, which is quite reminiscent of the curve of an open chain, transforms into a shape\ncorresponding to more spherical objects as f increases (as we have also seen in Sec. VI). Again, the f -dependence\nhere is quite dramatic, although \u015c(p\u0302) still increases for large p\u0302 as the stars are in an extended state.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have studied the correlation functions and related observables for a single homopolymer chain with\nseveral macromolecular architectures.\nA ring case is the most symmetric one and here we have discovered the universality of the dimensionless correlation\n(2)\nfunctions \u011dn for all chain index separations beyond small scale n\u2020 \u2243 5. Here the universality also holds for different\nchain lengths N .\nThe universality appears to be valid in terms of n for the globular state as well, although the scale index is of order\nn\u2217 \u221d N 2/3 there, and the correlation functions have a complicated oscillating behaviour. Interestingly, the original\n(2)\nfunction gn (r) is also n-universal for the globule, which is consistent with the behaviour of the pair correlation\n(2)\nfunction akin to that of simple liquids, so that the peaks in gn (r) occur at integer multiples of the hard core\n\u2217\ndiameter r = m d, requiring for Dn to become constant beyond n .\n(2)\nFor the coil the functions \u011dn can be accurately fitted via a power law times a stretched exponential - the des\nCloizeaux scaling function Eq. (16). The stretching exponent \u03b4, related to the fractal dimension of the chain, as\nwell as the power exponent \u03b8, related to the correlation hole effect, are found to be close to the results\n\u221a of theoretical\ncalculations in the special case when the Kuhn length is chosen equal to the hard sphere diameter: l/( \u03bad) = 1. This\nstrong repulsion regime is a special one because it most closely corresponds to the continuous model of the polymer\nchain.\nHowever, we have found that decreasing \u03ba results in a significant change in the power law exponent \u03b8, even though\nthe long\u2013distance exponent is less affected by that.\n\u221a This may be easily understood as a cross\u2013over to the Gaussian\nchain behaviour, namely \u03b8 \u2192 0 and \u03b4 \u2192 2 as l/( \u03bad) \u2192 \u221e. Strong sensitivity of the correlation hole on the model\nparameters also demonstrates that care should be taken when comparing universal renormalisation group predictions\nwith results from simulations of concrete systems.\nClearly, the ends play a special r\u00f4le for an open chain. Therefore, one has to distinguish the end\u2013end, end\u2013internal\nand internal\u2013internal correlations with the corresponding exponents \u03b8\u03c5 respectively. The exponent \u03b4 is found to be\nuniversal for strongly\u2013repulsive flexible coils of any architecture and numerically very close to that of the ring chain\n9\n\n\f(2)\n\nand to the theoretical prediction. Fitting \u011dij (r\u0302) via the des Cloizeaux expression in the strong repulsion regime\n\u221a\n(l/( \u03bad) = 1) has produced values fairly close to the results of theoretical calculations. The effect of cross\u2013over,\nwhen the internal monomer is placed in different locations along the chain, is also observed.\n(2)\nIn our study of the semi\u2013flexible ring chain we have observed a total lack of the n- or N - universality in \u011dn (r\u0302). The\ncorrelation hole at small r\u0302 is particularly sensitive on n even for chain separations n well exceeding the persistence\nlength parameter \u221d \u03bb. Naturally, the correlation hole expands for small n due to the stiffness of the chain and\n(2)\nconsequently contracts for larger n. We may note also that in the latter case the behaviour of \u011dn (r\u0302) is somewhat\nsimilar to that of the chain with loose springs, leading to smaller values of \u03b8.\nIn the case of star polymers one has to distinguish the special r\u00f4le of the core monomer in addition to the end\nmonomers, as well as the intra\u2013 and inter\u2013arm correlations. Generally, in the coil state here we have a des Cloizeaux\nscaling behaviour with nearly universal \u03b4, but with the exponent \u03b8 being strongly sensitive on the monomer indices\nij, number of arms f , as well as on the arm length (N \u2212 1)/f . A somewhat more stable behaviour for \u03b8 was only seen\nfor the intra\u2013arm correlations when both monomers are fairly far along the arm from the core monomer, agreeing\nwith the numerical values of \u03b8\u03c5=1,2 in an open chain.\nWe have also studied the average shape of the above described polymers by means of computing the asphericity\ncharacteristics. We have found that the coil of an open chain is fairly aspherical and prolate (rod\u2013like), while the coil\nof a ring is less so. Interestingly, the coil of a semi\u2013stiff ring becomes more aspherical and prolate than that of the\nflexible ring as \u03bb increases or N decreases. Star polymers in the coil state are fairly aspherical and prolate for small\nnumbers of arms f , becoming more spherical as f increases. Finally, the globule of a ring is nearly perfectly spherical.\nThe static structure factor, related to the sum of the 3-d Fourier transforms of the correlation functions, has been\ninvestigated in terms of its appropriate scaling variables. Behaviour at small rescaled wave numbers p\u0302 is universal,\nwhile the large p\u0302 tail scales as a power law with the exponent related to the fractal dimension of the object. In\ncases of the flexible open chain, the ring coil and the globule the functions \u015c(p\u0302) have shapes practically independent\nof polymer length N , which however is not true for semi\u2013flexible polymers. Likewise, functions \u015c(p\u0302) are strongly\ndependent on the number of arms f for star polymers.\nFinally, let us emphasise that we have only discussed the globule of a ring here because most of the results would\nbe little, if at all, affected by the change of the connectivity matrix in the dense globular state, although this is a\nmuch more complicated issue meriting a separate study in case of fairy stiff chains, where, as we know, transitions\ninto toroidal globules take place16 .\nThus, in this paper, we have seen that the degree of universality of various scaling functions and exponents is subject\nto more serious limitations than have been previously realised. The knowledge of various correlation functions of the\npolymer chain and their response to changes of various parameters provides us with the most detailed insight into\nthe structure of the system. Development of theoretical methods, which could reproduce various features observed in\nthis paper, is important for tackling larger system sizes and more complicated systems such as heteropolymers, for\nwhich simulations have severe limitations. This work is currently in progress and we hope to be able to return to such\nsubject in the near future.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful for interesting discussions to Professors F.
