We present chemical abundances for four main sequence B stars in the young cluster NGC 2004 in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Apart from H ii regions, unevolved OB-type stars are currently the only accessible\nsource of present-day CNO abundances for the MCs not altered by stellar evolution. Using UVES on the VLT,\nwe obtained spectra of sufficient resolution (R = 20 000) and signal-to-noise (S/N \u2265 100) to derive abundances for\na variety of elements (He, C, N, O, Mg and Si) with NLTE line formation.\nThis study doubles the number of main sequence B stars in the LMC with detailed chemical abundances. More\nimportantly and in contrast to previous studies, we find no CNO abundance anomalies brought on by e.g. binary\ninteraction or rotational mixing. Thus, this is the first time that abundances from H ii regions in the LMC can\nsensibly be cross-checked against those from B stars by excluding evolutionary effects. We confirm the H ii-region\nCNO abundances to within the errors, in particular the extraordinarily low nitrogen abundance of \u03b5(N) \u2243 7.0.\nTaken at face value, the nebular carbon abundance is 0.16 dex below the B-star value which could be interpreted\nin terms of interstellar dust depletion. Oxygen abundances from the two sources agree to within 0.03 dex.\nIn comparison with the Galactic thin disk at MC metallicities, the Magellanic Clouds are clearly nitrogen-poor\nenvironments.\nKey words.

Introduction\nYoung populous clusters like NGC 2004 in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) are ideal objects to study both\nthe current state of chemical evolution of the LMC and\nthe physics of hot stars at a metallicity a factor of two\nbelow that of the Sun.\nThe study of stellar absorption spectra yields chemical\nabundances with an accuracy comparable to that achieved\nfrom the analysis of nebulae such as H ii regions. However,\nboth sources are subject to physical processes which alter\nthe abundances of certain chemical species in a systemSend offprint requests to: A.J.

In most cases, the direction of these systematic effects is known, yet their extent is often uncertain.\nIn particular, the scaling of these effects with metallicity\nis poorly known. In H ii regions, it is mostly dust formation and depletion onto grains which will result in lower\nlimits on the present-day (pristine) abundances. As for B\nstars, rapid rotation can lead to contamination of the atmospheres with CN-cycled material from the core resulting in He and N enrichment and a corresponding C (and\n\u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 O) depletion (Fliegner et al. 1996,\nMeynet & Maeder 2000, Heger & Langer 2000). The onset\nof \"rotational mixing\" is a function of the rotation rate,\nstellar mass and metallicity. Rotating models of hot stars\nindicate that it can take place very early on, i.e. whilst\non the main sequence (MS). Furthermore, one can expect\nrotational mixing to be more efficient in metal-poor envi-\n\n\f2\n\nA.J. Korn et al.: Pristine CNO Abundances from Magellanic Cloud B Stars\n\nTable 1.

Maeder & Meynet 2001), as metal-deficient\nstars have smaller radii for a given mass and thus rotate\nfaster for a given angular momentum.\nAmong a sample of B stars only the fastest rotators\n(vrot > 200 km/s) are expected to display contaminated\nCNO abundances (Heger & Langer 2000, Meynet &\nMaeder 2000). If one is interested in the pristine presentday abundance pattern of these elements, it is therefore\nsensible to look for and analyse the least evolved objects\naccessible.\nSo far, the faintness of unevolved MC B stars (mV > 15m)\nhas prevented an extensive confrontation of the H ii-region\nCNO data with that from B dwarfs. Four stars have been\nstudied in detail, three by Rolleston et al. (1996) and one\nby Korn et al. (2000, hereafter Paper I). Of the three stars\nof Rolleston et al. (1996) one (PS 34\u2013144) is classified as\na He-weak star which we will therefore disregard in what\nfollows. The CNO abundances of the remaining three MS\nstars are confronted with the most recent measurements\nfrom H ii regions in Table 1: While the consistency among\ndeterminations of O abundances is very high, there is a\nsignificant positive offset (\u2243 0.7 dex) of B-star N abundances with respect to the H ii-region value.\nIt is a priori unclear which of the two data sets reflects\nthe pristine LMC N abundance. There are many possible\nexplanations for the peculiar behaviour of N: either the\nH ii-region value is systematically too low (note that it\nis \u2013 like all the other H ii-region data \u2013 exclusively based\non 30 Dor and N44C, cf. Garnett 1999), the B-star value\nsystematically too high or we see the imprint of a physical process which alters one of the two data sets. Since\ndust depletion of nitrogen seems hard to envision (Mathis\n1996), it looks as if the B stars are to blame. And indeed,\nit might be that \u2013 due to the limitations imposed on us\nby the use of 4m-class telescopes up to 1999 \u2013 choosing\nthe brightest targets compatible with MS colours resulted\nin preselecting stars that are preferentially rapid rotators\nas rapidly rotating stars will evolve to higher luminosities\n(Fliegner et al. 1996).\nWhatever the scenario, we regard it as worthwhile to push\nthe limit further towards the zero-age MS to see whether\nthe N abundances already found are representative of\nLMC B stars in general.\n\nIn contrast to the paucity of data on dwarfs, many MC supergiants \u2013 from spectral type O to K \u2013 have been studied\nin detail (e.g. Haser et al 1998: O-type, Paper I: B-type,\nVenn 1999b: A-type, Andrievsky et al. 2001: F-type, Hill\n& Spite 1999: K-type). Obviously, in trying to understand\nthe CNO pattern of these evolved objects the problem\nlies in separating all contributing signatures: abundance\nchanges due to dredge-up episodes in the red-giant phase\nand potentially rotational mixing in earlier phases when\nthe rotation rate was still high. This is particularly true\nfor stars located in the so-called Blue Hertzsprung Gap\n(between the MS and the region of blue-loop excursions,\ncf. Fitzpatrick & Garmany 1990), whose evolutionary status is still highly uncertain.\nLike in the MS B stars already discussed, the most significant signature is that of nitrogen: Among SMC Atype supergiants Venn (1999b) found a large scatter in\nNLTE (non local thermodynamic equilibrium) N abundances (6.9 \u2264 \u03b5(N) \u2264 7.7) which is hard to explain in the\nframework of the first dredge-up alone and argues in\nfavour of rotational mixing in earlier evolutionary phases\nas the most likely cause. As far as abundances from\nother elements with less pronounced signatures are concerned, one has to worry about how severely they might\nbe affected by systematic effects when comparing different spectral types: not in all cases the assumptions made\n(plane-parallel geometry, stationarity, LTE) are as justified as in the case of dwarfs. For example, the carbon\nabundance from K supergiants seems to be systematically\nhigher than in the hotter stars. On the whole, the general\npicture drawn above is, however, supported by all spectral\ntypes.\nAll in all, rotational mixing could help to resolve the discrepancies outlined above: adding rapid rotation, a fraction of any young stellar population will display modified\nCNO abundances, widen the MS, populate regions of the\nHRD which are traversed quickly by non-rotating stars\nand lead to enhanced scatter in N after the first dredgeup by mimicking a distribution of initial abundances.\n\n2. Preselection of suitable candidates\nSince B stars are frequently fast rotators and/or show\nemission in their Balmer lines (Be stars, cf. Jaschek et\nal. 1981), a great effort was made to select the small number of stars which are suitable for an abundance fine analysis: non-Be and with projected rotational velocities v sin i\nbelow 100 km/s.\nPreselection of slow rotators in NGC 2004 was\nmade from spectra obtained with the Siding Springs\nObservatory (SSO) 2.3m telescope using the Doublebeam Spectrograph. Aperture plates were fabricated\nto obtain medium resolution (0.3 \u00c5/pixel) spectra\n(4100 \u00c5 < \u03bb < 5100 \u00c5) for 34 MS B stars.\nTo determine v sin i we have used a \u03c72 minimization\ntechnique which locates an optimal match between the\nobserved spectrum and rotationally broadened synthetic\n\n\fA.J.

More details can be found in\nKeller et al. (2002). Principle limitations on this technique\nare given by the S/N and resolution obtainable with the\ninstrument used.\nAs can be seen from Table 1, our preselection was very\nsuccessful: four of the six targets (nearly 70 %) rotate at\na rate low enough to analyse their metal content spectroscopically.\n\n3. UVES observations\nDue to its high efficiency UVES (Ultraviolet-Visual\n\u00c9chelle Spectrograph) on ESO-VLT (Very Large\nTelescope) UT2 (Kueyen) is the ideal instrument for\nstudying MC MS B stars (mV > 15m). We initially considered using one of the standard templates for full optical\ncoverage (DIC1 390 + 564 nm), but rejected this option\nas it would have resulted in the loss of the strategic Si iii\ntriplet near 4560 \u00c5 (dichroic gap). We finally chose the\nUVES standard setting Blue 437nm (3760 \u00c5 < \u03bb < 4980 \u00c5)\ncovering all the strategic lines for a classical abundance\nfine analysis of B stars. The atmospheric dispersion\ncorrector (ADC) was used and the slit oriented in such\na way as to minimize contributions from neighbouring\nstars. The slit width was set to 1.2 \u2032\u2032 (corresponding to\na resolving power of R = 40 000) not to lose light under\nmoderate seeing conditions.\nOne to two spectra of each of the six preselected objects\nwere exposed in Service Mode between November and\nDecember 2000. We make use of the pipeline-reduced\nspectra: they turn out to be of sufficient quality in terms\nof rectification, even for the use of H\u03b2 as a gravity indicator. We note, though, that the blue part of the exposure\n(3800 \u2013 4600 \u00c5) is much less well-defined in terms of the\ncontinuum. After rebinning to a 2-pixel resolution of\n\nFig. 1. The red part of the Blue437 exposures of\nNGC2004/C9. The blaze residuals are very constant from\norder to order allowing for a thorough rectification using\na low-order polynomial.\nR = 20 000 the spectra were normalized interactively and\n\u2013 in the case of two exposures \u2013 coadded. Table 1 gives a\nbrief observation log including measured signal-to-noise\nratios (S/N) and projected rotational velocities (v sin i).\nBoth sets of quantities fall in the range expected from\nthe UVES exposure time calculator on the one hand and\nthe preselection on the other. Figure 1 shows the pipeline\nreduction result for the two spectra of C9 in the region\nsurrounding H\u03b2.\nhel\nExcept for B18, the heliocentric radial velocities vrad\nare\nfully compatible with that deduced for the cluster by\nFreeman et al. (1983). B18 (just like B15 from Paper\nI) has a radial velocity some 40 km/s higher than the\ncluster average. These two stars do probably not belong\nto the cluster. Unfortunately, the cluster membership of\nthe other programme stars is not certain either, since the\ndifference in radial velocity between the cluster and the\nsurrounding field is not significant within the errors.\n\n4. Analysis\nWe utilize the three-step analysis developed by and extensively discussed in Gummersbach et al. (1998) and Paper I.\nIn short, log g is derived from the profile of H\u03b2, Teff by\nbalancing two adjacent ionization stages of silicon as a\nfunction of \u03b5(Si) and \u03be, with \u03be being concordantly determined between silicon and a set of oxygen lines. In all\nthree steps, the metallicity of the underlying atmosphere\n(and with it the strength of the background opacities for\nthe NLTE calculation) is varied in a self-consistent manner. This was shown to have a non-negligible effect on\nthe abundances to be derived. In the simultaneous determination of Teff , log g, \u03be, \u03b5(Si) and \u03b5(O) the average\nunderabundance of Si and O is taken to be indicative of\nthe overall metallicity [m/H]. Due to the [\u03b1/Fe] ratio inherent to the MCs (see Sect. 5.2), this procedure results\nin slightly underestimated atmospheric metallicities. The\n\n\f4\n\nA.J. Korn et al.: Pristine CNO Abundances from Magellanic Cloud B Stars\n\nresidual discrepancy between [m/H] and [Fe/H] is, however, only of the order of 0.1 dex. Thus this approach is\nclearly superior to assuming [m/Fe] to be solar, as it is\nstill often found in the literature.\nWith regard to the NLTE line formation, new input\nphysics was implemented in the model atoms for C, N and\nMg. Here we only give a brief account of the expected reliability and refer the reader to the publications of Przybilla\n& Butler (2001) and Przybilla et al. (2001a,b).\nWe refer the reader to Paper I for an error analysis and\nreferences to the original publication of the other model\natoms.\n\n4.1. Carbon\nWith equivalent widths of 160 \u00b1 10 m\u00c5 the strong C ii\nfeature at 4267 \u00c5 (multiplet 6, cf. Fig. 3) is clearly visible\nin the spectra of our MS B stars (we don't have access\nto the two strong lines (multiplet 2) in the blue wing of\nH\u03b1). While it became clear relatively early on (Hardorp\n& Scholz 1970) that this line yields artificially low carbon abundances in LTE, a reliable NLTE modelling was\nonly achieved in the 1990s (Sigut 1996). Our model atom\nclosely resembles that of Sigut and we follow Sigut's argumentation showing that the abundances derived with it\nare reliable to typically 0.2 dex.\n\n4.2. Nitrogen\nThe model atom has been extended to be applicable to\nearly B-type stars. It includes the lowest 3 levels of N i,\n77 of N ii, the lowest 11 levels of N iii and the ground\nstate of N iv. Photoionization cross-sections and oscillatior strengths in N iii are adopted from the Opacity\nProject (Fernley, Hibbert, Kingston & Seaton; available\nonly from the Topbase database at http://cdsweb.ustrasbg.fr/topbase.html) and electron collisons from Rmatrix calculations by Stafford et al. (1994).\nThe spectrum of nitrogen lines is far less pronounced than\nthat of carbon. In fact, the strongest line at 3995 \u00c5 has\nequivalent widths below 50 m\u00c5 in our MS programme\nstars (cf. Fig. 3). In combination with projected rotation\nrates up to 70 km/s a clear detection requires S/N ratios of\naround 100. The situation is less critical in stars which are\nmore evolved and/or whose nitrogen abundance is higher,\ne.g. NGC 2004/B30 (125 m\u00c5) or NGC 1818/D1 (74 m\u00c5,\ncf. Fig. 4).\nAs far as the modelling is concerned, we note that the\nsubordinate lines at 4621 and 4630 \u00c5 yield abundances\nfully compatible with those derived from N ii 3995. As in\nthe case of carbon, these abundances are expected to be\naccurate to 0.2 dex.\n\n4.3. Magnesium\nThe only Mg line we have access to in the B-star temperature regime is the Mg ii doublet at 4481 \u00c5 (cf. Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 2. The loci of the programme stars with respect\nto evolutionary tracks of non-rotating stars for Z = 0.008\n(Schaerer et al. 1993). Also shown are the two luminosity class iii objects NGC 2004/B30 and B15 from Paper\nI. No evolution of chemical elements is detected in comparing the MS stars, whereas B30 from Paper I is clearly\nenriched in nitrogen and depleted in carbon.\nDepartures from LTE are found to be \u2243 \u22120.1 dex, the absolute abundances have not changed in going from the old\nto the new model atom.\n\n5. Results\nTable 3 gives the stellar parameters and abundances derived for the four programme stars in comparison with\nH ii-region data from Garnett (1999). Consistency among\nthe abundances is generally very high with the rms scatter\nconfined to well below 0.1 dex. Also included is the main\nsequence star D1 in the LMC cluster NGC 1818 already\nanalysed in Paper I. For the latter star, the abundances\nof He, C and N are redetermined on the basis of all available lines and utilizing the new model atoms. Where available, the abundances are compared with measurements\nfrom LMC H ii regions as carried out/compiled by Garnett\n(1999). Finally, we also include the Solar System composition (Grevesse & Sauval 1998) as a reference. Note that\na recent redetermination of the solar oxygen abundance\nfrom [O i] 6300 based on 3D hydrodynamical computations (Allende Prieto et al. 2001) yields \u03b5(O) = 8.69 \u00b1 0.05.\nHolweger (2001) comfirms this trend towards a lower value\nby deriving \u03b5(O) = 8.74 \u00b1 0.08 from eight optical and IR\nlines taking into account effects due to NLTE and granulation. Thus the difference between oxygen abundances from\nstars in Orion and the Sun reduces to 0.1 dex at most (cf.\nGummersbach et al. 1998), but important consequences\ncan also be expected for the evaluation of the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios in the MCs (see below).\nFigure 2 shows the positions of the programme stars in a\nlog Teff \u2013 log g parameter space, sometimes referred to as\nKiel diagram. Note that the four MS stars nicely span\nthe full width of the main sequence in the B-star temperature regime. This fact allows us to potentially address\n\n\fA.J.

NLTE\neffects in iron are currently under investigation. Thus,\nfor the time being, \u03b5(Fe) based on the few Fe iii lines\n(W\u03bb < 40 m\u00c5) visible between 4000 \u00c5 and 5000 \u00c5 is given\nassuming LTE.\n\n5.1. Pristine CNO abundances in the LMC\nIn comparing the stellar CNO abundances with the nebular ones, one immediately notices several features: the\noxygen abundances are in excellent agreement, while both\nnitrogen and carbon are somewhat more abundant in the\nstars. As carbon is one of the principle dust-forming elements, interstellar dust depletion is the first reason that\ncomes to mind. Though not of high statistical significance,\nthis offset of 0.16 dex could be interpreted as a manifestation of the fraction of carbon locked up in interstellar\ndust. Unfortunately, the error limits on both sides prevent\nus from drawing firm conclusions on this matter. Another\nobservation, however, may lend support to this scenario:\na very similar offset is found between the gas-phase carbon abundance of Orion (\u2243 8.4, cf. Garnett et al. 1995)\nand that of the Sun (between 8.52 (Grevesse & Sauval\n1998) and 8.59 according to Holweger 2001).

An enhanced nitrogen abundance in B stars could then be taken\nas an indication of mixing (internal or external), raising\nthe original (nebular) abundance from which the stars\nformed some million years ago. The high internal consistency among the \u03b5(N) determinations in the programme\nstars speaks against this scenario as a likely explanation.\nBesides, the residual offset with respect to the nebular\nabundance is hardly of high significance considering the\naccuracy of 0.2 dex for each of the data sets. We therefore take this result as strong evidence in favour of the\nextraordinarily low present-day nitrogen abundance\nof \u03b5(N) \u2243 7.0. On the square-bracket scale1 this corresponds to [N/H] \u2264 \u22120.92 at a metallicity of [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22120.2\nor [N/Fe] \u2243 \u22120.7. [N/Fe] \u2243 0 is only reached after the first\ndredge-up on the red-giant branch, as already emphasized\nby Venn (1999a).\nFinally, we comment on oxygen-related matters: there\ncan be little doubt that the present-day LMC oxygen abundance is close to 8.40. With a mean nitrogen abundance of 7.01, our mean oxygen value of 8.37\nresults in log(N/O) = \u22121.36. Therefore, even though the\nmetallicity of the LMC is not so different from solar, its\nN/O ratio is among the lowest found in the local universe,\nas derived from Galactic and extragalactic nebular and\nstellar abundances (cf. Henry et al. 2000). Indeed, within\nthe chemical evolution model favoured by Henry et al.,\nwhich attributes nitrogen production entirely to low and\n1\n\nX\nX\n) \u2212 log( nnY\n)\u2299\n[X/Y]\u22c6 := log( n\nnY \u22c6\n\n\f6\n\nA.J. Korn et al.: Pristine CNO Abundances from Magellanic Cloud B Stars\n\nintermedate-mass stars, this implies that the present-day\nnitrogen abundance of the LMC is still dominated by primarily produced nitrogen, which is consistent with the\nmetallicity-dependent nitrogen yields of van den Hoek &\nGroenewegen (1997).\n\n5.2. The \u03b1-elements\nDue to a state-of-the-art redetermination of the solar oxygen abundance (see above) it has become unclear what\n[O/Fe] ratio \u03b5(O) = 8.40 corresponds to. In fact, this question concerns not only oxygen, but all other \u03b1-elements\n(Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca and possibly Ti) in the sense that oxygen is often taken to be indicative of the behaviour of these\nelements. Thus the whole question of whether or not the\n[\u03b1/Fe] ratios in the MCs are vastly different from those\nfound in the Galactic thin disk at the appropriate metallicities must be re-evaluated in the light of these recent developments: From the three \u03b1-elements we have access to,\nwe derive [\u03b1/Fe] \u2243 \u22120.15 using the new solar oxygen abundance. Even if we account for a lower NLTE Fe abundance,\n[\u03b1/Fe] is still significantly lower than in the Galactic thin\ndisk: +0.10 at [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22120.3 (Fuhrmann 1998, 2000).\nFor silicon we find a relatively clear offset of stellar silicon\nabundances relative to that from H ii regions of 0.4 dex\nwhich could be significant. The LMC giants of Paper I\nshow a similar offset (\u2243 0.3 dex) which can most naturally\nbe explained as the fraction of silicon locked up in interstellar grains (silicates).\n\n5.3. Iron\nOn average, the iron abundances presented in Table 3 are\nmerely 0.17 dex below the solar value which is quite a high\nvalue for LMC objects. We reemphasize, however, that\nLTE results are given in Table 3. First results of the new\nNLTE computations indicate that the LTE results constitute upper limits to the NLTE abundances. Thus, the high\niron abundances is most likely caused by the inappropriateness of LTE for stars as hot as 25 000 K. For the time\nbeing, we account for this fact by assigning larger error\nbars (\u00b1 0.3 dex).\n\nHaving shown that our programme stars are bona-fide unmixed objects, we are hopeful that the derived ages are at\nleast not affected by rotation. As can be seen from Fig. 2,\nthe ages scatter substantially, e.g. C9 is fully compatible\nwith age zero. It is unclear whether or not this hints at\nmultiple star formation episodes for NGC 2004, as proposed by Caloi & Cassatella (1995) based on IUE data.\nOur best estimate comes from the most evolved MS target D15 close to the turnoff where the age resolution is\nhighest: 19 Myr \u2264 tNGC 2004 \u2264 24 Myr. A CMD analysis\nby Bencivenni et al. (1991) points towards a much lower\nage of 8 Myr confirming an earlier result by Hodge (1983).\nNote, though, that these estimates are based on B \u2212 V\ncolours which are a rather insensitive indicator of turnoff\ntemperatures and prone to contamination with Be stars.\nMore recently, Keller et al. (2000) utilized the HST filters\nF160BW (far UV), F555W (\"v\") and F656N (H\u03b1), separated the Be population and derived an age for the cluster\nof 16 \u00b1 4 Myr, in much better agreement with our result.\n\n5.5. A fresh look at NGC 1818/D1\nHaving redetermined the He, C and N abundance of this\nstar, it is worthwhile taking another look at it: even\nthough both \u03b5(He) and \u03b5(N) have decreased due to better\nstatistics and more sophisticated modelling, the signature\nindicative of mixing with CN-cycled material remains intact. More importantly, we now have pristine B star abundances to compare it to (see Fig. 4).\nThe agreement in the O, Mg, Si and Fe abundance with\nNGC 2004/C16 (the object closest to D1 in terms of stellar\nparameters) is remarkable, yet both carbon and nitrogen\nare offset by \u2265 0.3 dex in opposite directions. We refrain\nfrom rephrasing the discussion already presented in Paper\nI, but simply stress that NGC 1818/D1 remains a prime\ncandidate for a MS B stars that has undergone rotational\nmixing. We urge observations of boron to be performed\nfor this star which according to Fliegner et al. (1996) have\nthe potential of distinguishing between external contamination (e.g. binary interaction) and an internal process\nlike rotational mixing.\n\n6. Conclusions\n5.4. Isochrone ages\nIn comparison with evolutionary tracks, the stellar parameters may serve to constrain the cluster age which has\nonly been determined from colour-magnitude diagrams\n(CMD) so far. Biases are certainly present in both cases:\nMS fitting in CMDs will be prone to Be stars and rapid\nrotators \"above\" the MS mimicking a hotter turnoff and\nartificially lowering the derived age (cf. Grebel et al.\n1996). Additionally, (differential) reddening is always an\nissue. In the case of spectroscopic ages derived from individual stars, unknown cluster membership might introduce a bias, not even the direction of which is known.\nAdvantageously, reddening does not enter.\n\nWe have presented detailed chemical abundances for four\nMS B stars in NGC 2004. This study doubles the number of MS B stars in the LMC for which accurate abundances have been derived by means of high-resolution\nspectroscopy. None of the stars shows any indication of\neffects due to binary interaction or rotational mixing allowing us to derive what we consider to be the first data\nset of unaltered present-day CNO abundances from LMC\nstars.\n\u2013 We confirm the extraordinarily low LMC nitrogen\nabundance previously found from H ii-region studies to\nwithin 0.1 dex. This value is more than 0.5 dex below\naverage values found in the Galactic thin disk at LMC\n\n\fA.J. Korn et al.: Pristine CNO Abundances from Magellanic Cloud B Stars\n\nmetallicities (Liang et al. 2001, cf. their Fig. 10). It implies an enrichment history for the two environments\ndifferent from one another and \u2013 within the chemical\nevolution model of Henry et al. (2000) \u2013 a dominance\nof primary nitrogen production in the LMC until\ntoday.\n\u2013 In our programme stars, carbon is 0.16 dex above the\nnebular value. While this is the direction in which dust\ndepletion would act, the offset found is hardly significant considering the error limits on both sides. More\nwork is needed to reduce both random and systematic\nerrors to draw definitive conclusions on dust depletion\nfractions.\n\u2013 The B-star oxygen abundance (also from B giants, cf.\nPaper I) is in excellent agreement with the nebular\nvalue. In the absence of systematic offsets between the\ntwo data sets, little nebular oxygen seems to be tied\nup in grains at LMC metallicities.\n\u2013 The stellar silicon abundance is offset from the nebular\none by 0.4 dex. This might imply that a major fraction\nof the interstellar silicon in the LMC is bound in grains.\nThis work illustrates the potential of abundance analyses\nof hot stars based on high-quality spectra and sophisticated input physics. With modern multi-object spectrographs (e.g. GIRAFFE on VLT UT2 going on-line in 2002)\nwe will be able to analyse some 100 slowly rotating B stars\nin each Galactic and MC cluster like NGC 2004. This will\nnot only result in reduced random errors (which we will be\nable to address truly statistically for the first time), but\nalso prove or refute the importance of rotational mixing\nfor this class of stellar objects. In particular, a sequence\nconsisting of Galactic, LMC and SMC B stars could settle\nthe r\u00f4le metallicity, rotation and mass loss play in hotstar evolution. As for the H ii-region data, more objects\nwill have to be observed to beat down the errors on that\nside as well.\nSystematic errors \u2013 arguably more important than random ones at the current level of accuracy \u2013 will have to\nbe addressed by an integral approach: by studying the\nstellar and gas component of H ii regions in tandem. Both\nfields of research would undoubtedly profit from such an\nendeavour.\nAcknowledgements. AJK wishes to thank I.

Profile fits for H (gravity determination), Si ii/iii/iv (temperature and microturbulence indicator), C ii, N ii,\nO ii (microturbulence indicator) and Mg ii. The observed noise level can fully account for the difference between theory\nand observation. Note that the He abundance is not based on He i 4121 \u00c5, since the observed profile seems to contain\nunidentified blend contributions other that from helium and oxygen\n\n\fA.J.

Carbon and nitrogen profile fits for NGC 1818/D1: the best-fit value is compared to the mean value as derived\nfrom the four MS stars in NGC 2004. The thin line represents the LTE utility synspec (Teff = 25 000 K, log g = 4.0, \u03be =\n10 km/s, solar composition, cf. http://feros.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/websynspec.cgi) which is used to locate the\ncontinuum. Note that some of the line strengths are greatly overestimated under LTE conditions (e.g. C ii 4616/4619\nand 4625).\n\n\f"}
