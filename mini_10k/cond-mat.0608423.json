There are even rigorous proofs that at weak\ncoupling certain two-dimensional models for interacting\nelectrons (including the repulsive Hubbard model away\nfrom half filling) are Fermi liquids above an energy scale\nwhich is non-perturbative in the coupling constant [1].\nHowever, due to a lack of controlled methods, one cannot\nexclude the possibility that for sufficiently strong interactions Fermi liquid theory breaks down in 2D. Anderson\nhas argued repeatedly [2, 3] that due to non-perturbative\neffects which are neglected by the usual field-theoretical\nmachinery of many-body theory, the normal state of the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model is not a Fermi liquid\nfor arbitrary strength of the interaction. This scenario\nhas been criticized early on by Engelbrecht and Randeria [4], who pointed out that a calculation of the selfenergy \u03a3(k, \u03c9) within the ladder approximation (LAP)\npredicts Fermi liquid behavior. However, the LAP has\nsome rather peculiar and most likely unphysical features;\nin particular, the limiting behavior of \u03a3(k, \u03c9) for small\nfrequencies \u03c9 and for wave-vectors k in the vicinity of the\nFermi surface kF is very sensitive to the order in which\nthe limits \u03c9 \u2192 0 and k \u2192 kF are taken [5, 6].\nUnfortunately, going beyond the LAP is very difficult,\nbecause the particle-hole scattering channels have to be\ntaken into account on the same footing with the particleparticle scattering channel retained within the LAP, i.e.,\none has to solve coupled Bethe-Salpeter equations in several channels. In this work we shall take a fresh look at\nthis problem using a formally exact hierarchy for renormalization group (RG) flow equations for the one-particle\nirreducible vertices [7].\n\nFunctional RG in the spin-singlet channel. Starting point of our analysis are the formally exact RG\nflow equations for the irreducible self-energy \u03a3\u039b (K)\nand the antisymmetrized effective interaction vertex\n(4)\n\u0393\u039b (K1\u2032 \u03c31\u2032 , K2\u2032 \u03c32\u2032 ; K2 \u03c32 , K1 \u03c31 ). Here K = (k, i\u03c9) denotes wave-vector and Matsubara frequency, and \u03c3i are\nthe spin projections. \u039b is a cutoff scale separating the\nlow-energy from the high-energy degrees of freedom, such\nthat for \u039b = \u039b0 the low-energy fluctuations are suppressed. For the Hubbard model on a D-dimensional\nhyper-cubic lattice with lattice spacing a and on-site re(4)\npulsion U the bare interaction is \u0393\u039b0 = (\u03b4\u03c31 ,\u03c31\u2032 \u03b4\u03c32 ,\u03c32\u2032 \u2212\nD\n\u03b4\u03c31 ,\u03c32\u2032 \u03b4\u03c32 ,\u03c31\u2032 )\u01680 , where \u01680 = a U .

(12) the RG flow equation\n\u2202l ul = \u01ebul \u2212 u2l , \u01eb = 2 \u2212 D .\n\n(13)\n\nThe corresponding flow of ul is shown in Fig. 1. For\nD > 2 the RG flow has a stable Gaussian fixed point\nG at vanishing interaction, and an unstable fixed point\nUF at finite negative interaction u\u2217 = \u01eb < 0. At this\npoint the zero energy T -matrix diverges for \u039b \u2192 0,\nT\u039b (0, 0, i0) \u221d u\u2217 \u039b2\u2212D \u2192 \u2212\u221e, so that UF corresponds\nto the unitary Fermi gas in the limit of vanishing density [10]. For D = 2 both fixed points UF and G merge\ninto a single point UFG at zero interaction. Finally, for\nD < 2 the unitary fixed point UF has zero interaction,\nbecause in this case an infinitesimal attractive interaction\nleads to a zero energy bound state [11]. However, there is\na new non-Gaussian fixed point NG for finite repulsive interaction u\u2217 = \u01eb > 0, which resembles the Wilson-Fisher\nfixed point below four dimensions [12]. We now show\nthat this fixed point is characterized by a finite phase\nshift \u03b40 (0) = \u2212\u03c0\u01eb/2 for s-wave scattering at zero energy.\nSetting again \u0168k = \u01680 , the solution of Eq. (12) is\nT0 (i\u03c9\u0304) = T\u039b=0 (q \u2032 , q, i\u03c9\u0304) = \u01680 [1 + \u01680 \u03c70 (i\u03c9\u0304)]\u22121 ,\nwhere from Eq. (11) we obtain\nZ\ndD k \u0398(\u039b0 \u2212 |k|)\n\u03c70 (i\u03c9\u0304) = \u2212\n.\n(2\u03c0)D i\u03c9\u0304 \u2212 k2 /m\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nFor D < 2 the integral is convergent for \u039b0 \u2192 \u221e, and\nwe obtain for real frequencies,\n\b\n\u03c70 (\u03c9 + i0) = \u03c0\u03bdD (|\u03c9|, mr ) \u0398(\u2212\u03c9)[sin(\u03c0\u01eb/2)]\u22121\n+\u0398(\u03c9) [cot(\u03c0\u01eb/2) + i] ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03bdD (\u03c9, mr ) = KD mr (2mr \u03c9)\u2212\u01eb/2 is the density of\nstates of a free particle with reduced mass mr = m/2.\nIn 2D, where the density of states \u03bd2 (m) = m/(2\u03c0) is\nconstant, we have\n\u03c70 (\u03c9 + i0) = \u03c0\u03bd2 (mr ) [ln (E0 /|\u03c9|) + i\u0398(\u03c9)] ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere g(\u03c9) = \u03bdD (\u03c9, mr )\u01680 is the relevant dimensionless coupling. Because g(0) = \u221e for D < 2 due to\nthe divergence of the density of states, we conclude that\n\u03b40 (0) = \u2212\u03c0\u01eb/2 for any finite \u01680 > 0.\nLow-density expansion in 2D. If we approximate the\neffective interaction in Eq. (2) by \u0393(P ) given in Eq. (10)\nand ignore self-energy corrections to the propagators, we\nobtain the usual LAP for the self-energy [4, 5]. However,\nthe LAP is not a systematic low-density expansion. In 2D\nthe relevant dimensionless low-density parameter is \u03b1 =\n[ln(\u039b0 /kF )]\u22121 . One should therefore expand the LAP in\npowers of \u03b1. The self-energy within LAP up to order\n\u03b12 has been evaluated by Bloom [14] using the pseudopotential method pioneered by Galitskii [8, 15]. In this\nmethod one first derives a non-linear integral equation\nrelating the effective interaction in LAP to the on-shell\ntwo-body T -matrix in vacuum. Iteration of this integral\nequation generates the desired expansion in powers of \u03b1.\nThe RG equations (2) and (3) offer an alternative way\nto generate the low-density expansion in 2D. The advantage of the RG approach is that the contribution\nfrom the particle-hole channels neglected in LAP can\nbe systematically included. The crucial point is that\nEqs. (2) and (3) remain formally valid if we take the\nderivative with respect to any parameter appearing only\nin the free propagator [7]. In particular, we may choose\n\u039b = \u03bc, in which case Eq. (2) and (3) describe the\nevolution of the self-energy and the effective interaction as we change the chemical potential. The propagator in the flow equations should then be replaced by\nG\u03bc (K) = [i\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebk + \u03bc \u2212 \u03a3\u03bc (K)]\u22121 , and the single scale\npropagator by \u0120\u03bc (K) = \u2212G2\u03bc (K). The flow equation for\nthe self-energy now reads\nZ\nP\nP\n\u2202\u03bc \u03a3\u03bc (K) =\n\u0120\u03bc (P \u2212 K)\u0393\u03bc ( \u2212 K, \u2212 K; P ) , (19)\n2\n2\nP\nand the flow equation for the effective interaction can be\nobtained by making analogous substitutions in Eq. (3).\nAssuming that an expansion in powers of \u03bc is possible, we\nmay generate this expansion by successive differentiation\nof Eq. (19) and the analogue of Eq. (3). For \u0168k = \u01680\nthe initial conditions at \u03bc = 0 are \u03a3\u03bc=0 (K) = 0 and\np2\n\u0393\u03bc=0 ( P2 \u2212 K, P2 \u2212 K; P ) = T0 (i\u03c9\u0304 \u2212 4m\n) \u2261 T (P ). The\nleading term in the expansion of the self-energy is\nZ\n\u03a3\u03bc (K) = \u03bc\n\u01200 (P \u2212 K)T (P ) + O(\u03bc2 ) ,\n(20)\nP\n\nand from Eqs. (3) and (6) we obtain for the effective\n\n\f4\ninteraction\n\u0393\u03bc (Q\u2032 , Q; P ) = T (P ) \u2212 \u03bcT 2 (P )[\u2202\u03bc \u03c7(P )]\u03bc=0\nZ n\n\u03bc\n[\u01200 (K)G0 (K + Q + Q\u2032 )\n\u2212\n2 K\nP\n+G0 (K)\u01200 (K + Q + Q\u2032 )]T (K + Q + )\n2\no\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7T (K + Q + ) + (Q \u2192 \u2212Q ) + O(\u03bc2 ), (21)\n2\nwhere the pair susceptibility \u03c7(P ) at finite \u03bc is given\nin Eq. (11). The second term on the right-hand side\nof Eq. (21) is due to the \u03bc-dependence of the effective\ninteraction in LAP, while the last term is the contribution\nfrom the particle-hole channels neglected in LAP.\nDue to the non-analytic \u03bc-dependence of the density\nof states for D 6= 2 the above expansion in powers of \u03bc\nis only possible in D = 2. To see this more clearly, let us\nexplicitly evaluate the first term on the right-hand side\nof Eq. (20). The result can be written as\n\u03a3\u03bc (k, i\u03c9) \u2248 \u03c10 (\u03bc)T0 (i\u03c9 \u2212\n\nk2\n),\n4m\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c10 (\u03bc) = \u03bc\u03bd2 (m). In fact, Eq. (22) is the leading\nterm in the expansion in powers of T0 for arbitrary D\nif we identify \u03c10 (\u03bc) \u2261 (2/D)\u03bc\u03bdD (\u03bc, m) \u221d \u03bcD/2 with the\ndensity (per spin projection) in the absence of interactions. The non-analyticity in \u03bc for D 6= 2 is obvious.\nIf we approximate T0 by the bare interaction \u01680 , then\nEq. (22) reduces to the Fock correction to the selfenergy. In contrast to the usual LAP [4, 5], the particleparticle susceptibility is evaluated at vanishing density\nin Eq. (22). It is instructive to explicitly calculate the\ncorresponding single-particle Green function G(k, i\u03c9) for\nD \u2264 2. The relation between \u03bc and Fermi momentum kF\n2\n2\nkF\nkF\n+ \u03c10 (\u03bc)T0 (\u2212 4m\n) = \u03bc. Expanding G\u22121 (k, i\u03c9)\nis then 2m\nfor small \u03c9 and |k| \u2212 kF we obtain the Fermi liquid form\nG(k, i\u03c9) \u2248 Z[i\u03c9 \u2212 (kF /m\u2217 )(|k| \u2212 kF )]\u22121 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwith quasi-particle residue Z = 1 \u2212 \u01eb2 g 2 [\u01eb + g]\u22122 and effective mass renormalization m/m\u2217 = 1 \u2212 12 \u01eb2 g 2 [\u01eb + g]\u22122.\nHere g = \u03bdD (\u03bc, mr )\u01680 , and in 2D we should replace\n\u01eb \u2192 \u03b1 = [ln(\u039b0 /kF )]\u22121 . For g \u2192 \u221e we obtain Z \u2248 1\u2212\u01eb2\nand m/m\u2217 = 1 \u2212 \u01eb2/2. This agrees qualitatively with the\nresults by Bloom [14], who obtained different numerical\ncoefficients on front of the correction terms, which is due\nto the fact that his approximation amounts to retaining\nalso the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (21).\nHowever, to order T02 the particle-hole contributions to\nEq. (21) compete with the particle-particle channel retained in Ref. [14], so that the approximation employed\nby Bloom is inconsistent. In this point we agree with\nAnderson [3], but for different reasons: there is no mathematical mistake in Bloom's analysis, but in 2D the LAP\nis inconsistent beyond the leading order in T0 .\n\nIn summary, we have reconsidered the low-density expansion for the electron gas in dimensions D \u2264 2 using functional RG methods. At vanishing density, we\nhave rewritten the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the\ntwo-body T -matrix in vacuum as a RG flow equation\nand have pointed out that for D < 2 this equation has\na non-Gaussian fixed point characterized by a finite swave phase shift. At low densities in 2D a systematic\nexpansion of the self-energy and of the effective interaction in powers of the two-body T -matrix can be generated with the help of the functional RG flow equations\nfor the irreducible vertices using the chemical potential as\nflow parameter. We have argued that in 2D the LAP is\ninconsistent beyond the leading order in this expansion\nbecause already at order T02 the contribution from the\nparticle-hole channels competes with the particle-particle\nchannel and gives rise to a complicated momentum- and\nfrequency dependence of the effective interaction which\nstill has to be explored. Because the LAP is not reliable\nin 2D, one cannot use the LAP to rule out that the true\neffective interaction in 2D exhibits a singular dependence\non the relative momenta, as proposed by Anderson [2, 3].\nWe thank M.
