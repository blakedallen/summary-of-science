The states have finite\nnorms and unlike the states that are usually used to derive path integrals, they break SU(3)\nsymmetry by choosing preferred gauge directions. This symmetry breaking may also give\neffective masses to some of the gauge bosons of the theory.\n\nIntroduction\nThe most common way to quantize SU(3) and other non-Abelian gauge theories is to use\nthe path-integral formalism. In this formalism, path integrals represent the transition probability\nto go from one gauge-invariant state to another. In non-Abelian gauge theories, the nonlinear\nnature of the gauge constraints makes it very difficult to explicitly define and work with gaugeinvariant states directly. By expanding the space of quantized fields to include ghosts, and by\nmaking a connection between gauge-invariance and BRST-invariance, the BRST method enables\na straightforward definition of physical states that can be used in path integrals (see for example\n[1]). To avoid inconsistencies in the formulation, the underlying BRST-invariant states should\nalso have finite norms [2].\nThe BRST-invariant states that are easiest to construct are those that are annihilated\neither by all of the gauge constraints (Dirac condition) or by all of the ghost operators. The main\nproblem with using these states in path integrals is that they do not have well-defined norms. In a\nseries of papers [2-7], it has been shown that if one multiplies these na\u00efve BRST-invariant states\nby certain BRST-exact exponentials, one can create BRST-invariant states that do have finite\nnorms. Using these finite-norm states, a consistent probabilistic interpretation is justified, and the\npath integral takes its usual form as the exponential of a gauge-constrained, classical action\ninvolving Fadeev-Popov ghosts.\n\n1\n\n\fIn this paper, new finite-norm, BRST-invariant states are constructed for SU(3). Using\nthese new states rather than the usual ones amounts to making a different choice for how to\ncanonically quantize the underlying theory. Unlike the usual states that treat every gauge\ndirection the same, the new states break the SU(3) symmetry by choosing preferred gauge\ndirections. Although path integrals are not constructed from the new states, it may be that the\naction associated with these path integrals could develop effective mass terms for the gauge\nbosons.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In the first section, standard definitions are given, and\nthe BRST-invariant states usually used in non-Abelian gauge theories are presented. In the\nsecond section, new notation is defined and the new solutions are presented. The last section\ncontains summary comments and ideas for future work.\n\nStandard BRST Quantization\nThe calculations throughout the paper shall pertain to an SU(3) Yang-Mills gauge field\ntheory, quantized using BRST canonical quantization. For convenience, space is assumed to be a\nthree-dimensional grid with N discreet points in a large volume V , so that integrals over space\nare replaced by sums over points, etc. The transition from discrete space back to continuous\nspace will not be addressed in this paper.\nThe following definitions are used:\n\u2022\n\nCanonical fields, their momenta: Aia , \u03a0 ia\n\n\u2022\n\nGhost fields, their momenta: \u03b7 a , Pa\n\n\u2022\n\nLagrange multipliers, their momenta: \u03bb a , \u03c0 a\n\n\u2022\n\nAnti-ghost fields, their momenta: \u03b7 a , Pa\n\n\u2022\n\nGauge constraints: Ga = \u2212 \u2202 i \u03a0 ia \u2212 gf\n\n\u2022\n\nBRST charge: \u03a9 =\n\n(\n\n\u2211 [\u03b7 G\na\n\na\n\n+ 12 igf\n\nx\n\n\u2022\n\nGhost number operator: G =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03a0 bi Aic\n\n)\n\n\u03b7 a\u03b7 b Pc + Pa\u03c0 a ]\n\nabc\n\n\u2211 ( [\u03b7\nx\n\nabc\n\na\n\n[\n\n, Pa ] \u2212 \u03b7 a , Pa\n\n] ),\n\n(1)\n\nAll of the operators defined above are Hermitian except for the ghost number operator, which is\nanti-Hermitian. f\n\nabc\n\nis the totally antisymmetric SU(3) structure constant, and the spatial\n\nderivatives \u2202 i in the gauge constraints are defined as differences in the usual way for discretespace analyses.\n\n2\n\n\fCanonical quantization is achieved through the following commutators and\nanticommutators:\n\n[\u03a0 (xr, t ), A ( yr, t )] = \u2212i\u03b4 \u03b4\n[\u03c0 (xr, t ), \u03bb ( yr, t )] = \u2212i\u03b4 \u03b4\n{\u03b7 (xr, t ), P ( yr, t )} = \u03b4 \u03b4\n{\u03b7 (xr, t ), P ( yr, t )} = \u03b4 \u03b4\na\ni\n\nb\nj\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\nij\n\nab\n\nab\n\n\u03b4 xy\n\nxy\n\nxy\n\nab\n\n(2)\n\nxy\n\nSince calculations are being made in discrete space rather than continuous space, Kroenecker\ndelta functions are used rather than Dirac delta functions. Using these commutation relations, it\nis straightforward to see that the gauge constraints close in an SU(3) group under commutation,\n\n[G\n\na\n\n(xr, t ), Gb ( yr, t )]\n\n= \u2212ig\u03b4 xy f\n\nabc\n\nr\nG c (x , t ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nand that the BRST charge is nilpotent, \u03a9 2 = 0 .\nIn BRST quantization, the physical states of the theory must be annihilated by the BRST\ncharge. For non-Abelian theories, this is most easily accomplished by imposing one of the\nfollowing two conditions on physical states:\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n\u03c0 a \u03be\u03b1 = \u03b7 a \u03be\u03b1 = \u03b7 a \u03be\u03b1 = 0\n\nor\n\n(4a)\n\n~\n~\n~\nGa \u03be \u03b1\u2032 = Pa \u03be \u03b1\u2032 = Pa \u03be \u03b1\u2032 = 0 .\n\n(4b)\n\nwhere the index \" \u03b1 \" specifies the field structure of a particular state which meets one of the\nabove two conditions. Both of the states above are annihilated by the ghost number operator G ,\nso they are ghost number eigenstates with ghost number equal to zero.\nA problem with the states in (4) is that they do not have well-defined norms. For\nexample, after expanding the states in (4a) in the Schroedinger representation (and ghost\nmomentum representation), one finds:\n\nr 2\n~ ~\n\u03be \u03b1 \u03be\u03b1 = \u222b \u220f \uf8ee\uf8efdAia d\u03bba dPa dPa \u03c8 \u03b1 (Aia ( x ) ) \uf8f9\uf8fa\nx\n\n(\n\nr\n\n)\n\n\uf8f0\n\n\uf8fb\n\nr\n\n~\n\nwhere \u03c8 \u03b1 Aia ( x ) = Aia ( x ) \u03be \u03b1\n\n(5)\n\nis the wave function of the physical state with index \u03b1 .\n\n~\n\nSince \u03c0 a \u03be \u03b1 = 0 , the wave functions are independent of \u03bb a , so integrations over the Lagrange\nmultipliers produce factors of infinity. At the same time, the Berezin integrals over dPa and\n\n3\n\n\fdPa are equal to zero. Thus the states defined by the condition (4a) have ill-defined norms.\nSimilar arguments apply to the states defined by (4b).\nIn [4], it was pointed out that BRST-invariant states with finite norms can be constructed\nif one multiplies these states by BRST-exact exponentials and quantizes the Lagrange-multipler\nsector with an indefinite metric. Consider the states:\n\n\uf8eb\uf8f1\n\n\uf8fc\uf8f6 ~\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8fe\uf8f8\n\n\uf8ed\n\n(\n\n~\n\n)\uf8f6 ~\n\n\u03be \u03b1 = exp\uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f2\u03a9 ,\u2212\u03b5 \u2211 \u03bb a Pa \uf8fd \uf8f7\uf8f7 \u03be \u03b1 = exp\uf8ec \u2212 \u03b5 \u2211 \u03bb a Ga \u2212 iPa Pa \uf8f7 \u03be \u03b1 ,\n\uf8ed\uf8f3\n\nx\n\nx\n\n\uf8f8\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is a real, nonzero constant and\n\n~\nGa = G a + igf\n\n\u03b7 b Pc .\n\nabc\n\n(7)\n\nSince the exponent of (6) is a BRST-exact function, those states are still BRST-invariant. They\nalso still have zero ghost number. Furthermore, they have well-defined norms given by:\n\nr 2\n\u03be \u03b1 \u03be\u03b1 = \u222b \u220f \uf8ee\uf8ef dPa Pa dPa Pa dAia \u03b4 (G a )\u03c8 \u03b1 (Aia ( x ) ) \uf8f9\uf8fa\nx ,a\n\n\uf8f0\n\n\uf8fb\n\n(8)\n\nthat are independent of \u03b5 . In the above expression, the Berezin integrals over the ghosts and\nanti-ghosts no longer vanish, but produce factors of 1. At the same time, integrations over \u03bb a no\nlonger produce infinities, but instead produce the delta functions \u03b4 (Ga ) . A subtle requirement in\nproducing these delta functions is that the Lagrange-multipler momentum states \u03bb a must be\nquantized with indefinite metric. In the context of this quantization, the Hermitian operators \u03bb a\nhave imaginary eigenvalues [1,8], leading to delta functions upon integration.\nPath integrals can be derived by using the states in (6) to calculate projected kernels of\nthe operator exp(i\u03b5H ) , where H is the Hamiltonian and \u03b5 is an infinitesimal time interval. The\nprocess of projecting the kernels onto the physical states of (6) effectively adds a term to the\nHamiltonian:\n\n(\n\n~\nH \u2192 H + \u2211 A0a Ga + Pa Pa\nx\n\n)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere A0a \u2261 \u2212i\u03bb a is an anti-Hermitian operator with real eigenvalues (due to the indefinite\nmetric). By inserting a complete set of canonical momentum states, integrating over the\nmomenta, and going to the continuum limit, the path integral kernel takes its usual form as the\nexponential of a gauge-constrained, classical action involving Fadeev-Popov ghosts. Later in the\npaper, it will be seen that the new solutions presented here lead to differences in the path integral.\n\n4\n\n\fIn any case, a prerequisite to developing a consistent path integral formulation is to start with\nBRST-invariant states that have finite norms.\nThere is another way to prove that the states in (6) have finite norms. In [2,3], it was\nshown that if BRST-invariant states are independently annihilated by two conjugate, nilpotent\noperators whose sum is equal to the BRST charge, then those states have finite norms, provided\nthat they satisfy the following additional conditions. The nilpotent operators must have a ghost\nfactor c a and a constraint factor \u03c6 a (which may also contain ghosts), and if the constraint\nannihilates a state, then the conjugate of the constraint should not annihilate the same state.\nThese requirements can be summed up by:\n\n\u03a9 = \u03b4 +\u03b4 \u2020\n\n\u03b42 =0\n\u03b4 = c a \u2020\u03c6 a\nc a \u03be\u03b1 = \u03c6 a \u03be\u03b1 = G \u03be\u03b1 = 0\n\n( )\u03be\n\nf \u03c6a\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2260 0 unless f = 0 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe last \"canonical\" condition allows one to represent the matter states canonically in such a way\nthat the gauge constraint degrees of freedom can be factored out. In [4], it was shown that the\nstates of eq. (6) satisfy these conditions and are therefore BRST-invariant states with finite norms.\n\nNew classes of BRST-invariant states for SU(3)\nIn this section, new BRST-invariant states will be explicitly constructed. Unlike the\nstates considered in the last section, these new states do not mix the minimal and non-minimal\n(Lagrange multiplier) sectors for the off-diagonal gauge directions. As a result, in the context of\nthese states, the off-diagonal non-minimal sector decouples, so one need only consider a BRST\ncharge with non-minimal contributions in the diagonal gauge directions:\n\n[\n\n\u03a9\u2032 = \u2211 \u03b7 a G a + 12 igf abc\u03b7 a\u03b7 b Pc + P3\u03c0 3 + P8\u03c0 8\nx\n\n]\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nUsing this BRST charge, the states presented in this section will be shown to be BRST-invariant\nwith finite norms by satisfying the conditions of (9).\nState construction begins with the following definitions which preserve ghost number:\n\n\u03b71\u00b1 = (\u03b71 m i\u03b7 2 )\n\nP1 \u00b1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(P1 m iP2 )\n\nG1\u00b1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(G1 m iG2 )\n\n\u03b7 2\u00b1 = (\u03b7 4 \u00b1 i\u03b7 5 )\n\nP2\u00b1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(P4 \u00b1 iP5 )\n\nG 2\u00b1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(G4 \u00b1 iG5 )\n5\n\n\f\u03b7 3\u00b1 = (\u03b7 6 m i\u03b7 7 )\n\nP3\u00b1 =\n\nc 4\u00b1 = (\u03b7 3 m i\u03b5P3 )\n\n1 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nk 4\u00b1 = 12 \uf8ec P3 m i \u03b7 3 \uf8f7\n\u03b5 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03c8 4\u00b1 = 12 \uf8ec G3 m i \u03c0 3 \uf8f7\n\u03b5 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\nc5\u00b1 = (\u03b7 8 m i\u03b5P8 )\n\n1 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nk 5\u00b1 = 12 \uf8ec P8 m i \u03b7 8 \uf8f7\n\u03b5 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03c8 5\u00b1 = 12 \uf8ec G8 m i \u03c0 8 \uf8f7 ,\n\u03b5 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n2\n\n(P6 m iP7 )\n\nG3\u00b1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(G6 m iG7 )\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is a nonzero constant. The indices on the ghost fields on the right-hand sides of the\nabove equations assume a basis for SU(3) defined by the standard 8 Gell-Mann 3x3 matrices. It\nshould be noted that the operators in the Gell-Mann \"5\" direction have different signs from those\nin the \"2\" and \"7\" directions, and that the third \"off-diagonal\" constraints G3\u00b1 are distinct from\nthe constraint G3 that is in the diagonal \"3\" gauge direction.\nThe BRST charge can be rewritten in terms of the operators in (11). One finds:\n\nr\nr\nr\n\u03a9\u2032 = \u2211 [\u03a91 ( x ) + \u03a9 2 ( x ) + \u03a9 3 ( x )]\nx\n\n(\n\n\u03a91 = \u03b7 i\u2212 Gi+ + \u03b7 i+ Gi\u2212 \u2212 14 g\u03b5 ijk \u03b7 i+\u03b7 +j Pk + + \u03b7 \u2212j \u03b7 i\u2212 Pk \u2212\n\n(\n\n)(\n\n)\ng (c\n\n)\n(\n\n)(\n\n\u03a9 2 = 14 g 2\u03b71+\u03b71\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7 2+\u03b7 2\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7 3+\u03b7 3\u2212 k 4+ + k 4\u2212 + 14 g 3 \u2212 \u03b7 2+\u03b7 2\u2212 + \u03b7 3+\u03b7 3\u2212 k 5+ + k 5\u2212\n\u03a9 3 = c 4\u2212\u03c8 4+ + c 4+\u03c8 4\u2212 + c5\u2212\u03c8 5+ + c5+\u03c8 5\u2212 +\n\n1\n4\n\n+\n4\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n+ c 4\u2212 N 3 + 14 g 3 c5+ + c5\u2212 N 8\n\nN 3 \u2261 2\u03b71+ P1 \u2212 \u2212 2\u03b71\u2212 P1 + \u2212 \u03b7 2+ P2\u2212 + \u03b7 2\u2212 P2+ \u2212 \u03b7 3+ P3\u2212 + \u03b7 3\u2212 P3+\nN 8 \u2261 \u2212\u03b7 2+ P2\u2212 + \u03b7 2\u2212 P2+ + \u03b7 3+ P3\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7 3\u2212 P3+ ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the indices i, j, k run over the values 1, 2, 3. This form of the BRST charge highlights the\nthreefold symmetry of the \"off-diagonal\" generators of SU(3), especially in the term in \u03a91 that\nhas a factor of \u03b5 ijk .\nA prerequisite to satisfying eqs (9) is that one must be able to split the gauge constraints\ninto two conjugate groups that separately close under commutation. Consider the following\ngroupings of gauge constraints:\n\n\u03c6 \u2261 G1+\n\n\u2212\n3 1\n\n1\n\n\u03c6 2\u2212 \u2261 G 2\u2212\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c6 \u2261 G1\u2212\n\n\u2212\n5 1\n\n3\n\n\u03c6 2\u2212 \u2261 G2+\n\n5\n\n\u03c6 2\u2212 \u2261 G 2\u2212\n\n\u03c6 3\u2212 \u2261 G3\u2212\n\n3\n\n\u03c63\u2212 \u2261 G3\u2212\n\n5\n\n\u03c6 3\u2212 \u2261 G3+\n\n\u03c6 4\u2212 \u2261 \u03c8 4\u2212 + g\n\n3\n\n\u03c6 4\u2212 \u2261 \u03c8 4\u2212 \u2212 12 g\n\n5\n\n\u03c6 4\u2212 \u2261 \u03c8 4\u2212 \u2212 12 g\n\n\u2212\n1 1\n\n\u03c6 \u2261 G1\u2212\n\n6\n\n\f1\n\n\u03c6 5\u2212 \u2261 \u03c8 5\u2212\n\n3\n\n\u03c65\u2212 \u2261 \u03c8 5\u2212 \u2212\n\n3\ng\n2\n\n5\n\n\u03c6 5\u2212 \u2261 \u03c8 5\u2212 +\n\n3\ng\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThe five constraints in each column close under commutation, while their complex conjugates\nseparately close. Each grouping will be called a \"class\", labeled with a left lower index. The use\nof only odd numbering of classes in (13) reflects the fact that three additional classes can be\nconstructed as follows: On the right hand sides of the above equations, change the sign of the\nconstant terms in the fourth and fifth constraints, and change all of the \u2013 indices to + indices and\nvice versa. The new classes created in this way from classes 1, 3, and 5 will be numbered 2, 4,\nand 6, respectively.\nFor each of the classes above, one can separate the BRST charge into two separately\nnilpotent, conjugate components. For example, for the first class above, one can define:\n\n\u03b4 1 = \u03b71\u2212 G1+ + \u03b7 2+ G2\u2212 + \u03b7 3+ G3\u2212 \u2212 14 g\u03b5 ijk\u03b7 i+\u03b7 +j Pk + + c 4+\u03c8 4\u2212 + c 5+\u03c8 5\u2212 + 14 gc4+ N 3 + 14 g 3c5+ N 8\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n+ 14 g 2\u03b71+\u03b71\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7 2+\u03b7 2\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7 3+\u03b7 3\u2212 k 4+ + 14 g 3 \u2212 \u03b7 2+\u03b7 2\u2212 + \u03b7 3+\u03b7 3\u2212 k 5+ .\n\n(14)\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that the above operator is nilpotent and satisfies \u03a9 \u2032 = \u03b4 1 + \u03b4 1 .\n\u2020\n\nSimilar separations can be made for the other two classes of (13). Separations similar to that of\n(14) were pointed out in [3] for more general Lie groups.\nFor each class in (13) one can also define \"matter\" states\nn\n\n\u03c6 \u03bc\u2212 n M \u03b1 = 0\n\nbut\n\nn\n\nn\n\nM\u03b1\n\nthat satisfy\n\n\u03c6 \u03bc+ n M \u03b1 \u2260 0 .\n\n(15)\n\nIn the above equations, the index n denotes one of the classes of eq (13), the index \u03bc runs over\nthe 5 constraints in each class, and the index \u03b1 runs over all of the matter states that satisfy the\nabove conditions. It has been shown in [2,3] that matter states that satisfy these conditions are\ncanonical with finite inner products, so one may take them to be orthonormal:\nn\n\nM\u03b1\n\nn\n\nM \u03b2 = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe ghost states for each class can be specified as follows:\n\n\u03b71+ 1 G = P1 + 1 G = \u03b7 2\u2212 1 G = P2\u2212 1 G = \u03b7 3\u2212 1 G = P3\u2212 1 G = 0\n\u03b71\u2212 3 G = P1 \u2212 3 G = \u03b7 2+ 3 G = P2+ 3 G = \u03b7 3\u2212 3 G = P3\u2212 3 G = 0\n\u03b71\u2212 5 G = P1 \u2212 5 G = \u03b7 2\u2212 5 G = P2\u2212 5 G = \u03b7 3+ 5 G = P3+ 5 G = 0\nc k\u2212\n\nn\n\nG = k k\u2212\n\nn\n\nG =0 ,\n\n(17)\n\n7\n\n\fwhere the left lower index on the ghost states is again being used to identify the class. The even\nnumber classes 2, 4, and 6 are found from 1, 3, and 5 by changing the sign of the upper indices in\nthe first three lines of (17). All of the ghost states have vanishing ghost number, and they can\neach be assumed to have a norm equal to 1.\nWith the above definitions, the following states are easily verified to be BRST-invariant:\nn\n\n\u03be\u03b1 =\n\nn\n\nG\n\nn\n\nM\u03b1\n\n(18)\n\nFurthermore, due to (16), the states in any give class are orthonormal. It is interesting that\neach of the states breaks the threefold symmetry of SU(3) by treating one off-diagonal direction\ndifferently from the other two.\nAnother interesting feature of these states can be seen by writing their diagonal sectors in\na form similar to that of eq. (6). For example, one may rewrite\n\n\u03be\u03b1 = exp(\u2212 \u03b5 {\u03a9 , K1 }) 1 G\n\n~\n\n1\n\n{\u03a9 , K } = \u2211 \u03bb (G\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\u03be\n\nas follows:\n\n1 \u03b1\n\n~\nM\u03b1\n\n(\n\n)\n\n+ 12 gN 3 ) + \u03bb8 G8 + 12 3 N 8 \u2212 iP3 P3 \u2212 iP8 P8\n\n(19)\n\nIn order to ensure that (15) and (17) continue to hold, these new matter and ghost states\nbecome Schroedinger-like in the diagonal sector (compare to (4a)),\n~\n~\n~\n\u2212\n1 \u03c6i 1 M \u03b1 = \u03c0 3 1 M \u03b1 = \u03c0 8 1 M \u03b1 = 0\n~\n\n~\n\n\u03b73 1 G = \u03b78 1 G = \u03b73\n\n1\n\n~\nG = \u03b78\n\n1\n\n~\nG = 0,\n\n(20)\n\nand the ghost states also still satisfy the conditions in the first line of (17). The exponent in (19)\nsimplifies due to the fact that each of the ghost states in (13) are eigenstates of the operators N 3\nand N 8 . One finds\n\n{\u03a9 , K }\n1\n\n1\n\n[\n\n~\nG = \u2211 \u03bb3 (G3 + 2 g ) + \u03bb8 G8 \u2212 iP3 P3 \u2212 iP8 P8\nx\n\n]\n\n1\n\n~\nG .\n\n(21)\n\nThe most surprising thing about the above operator is that it contains a term that is linear in \u03bb3 .\nTo understand the implications of this term, note that the Lagrange-multipler states \u03bb a\nmust again be quantized with indefinite metric in order for the integrations over \u03bb3 and \u03bb8 to\nproduce delta functions \u03b4 (G3 + 2 g ) and \u03b4 (G8 ) which are consistent with the constants in the\nfourth and fifth lines of (13). Due to this indefinite metric, one can again define A0a \u2261 \u2212i\u03bb a ,\n\n8\n\n\fwhere A0a is an anti-Hermitian operator with real eigenvalues. In the path integral, one can then\nmake a replacement similar to that of (9),\n\n[\n\nH \u2192 H + \u2211 A03 (G3 + 2 g ) + A08 G8 + P3 P3 + P8 P8\nx\n\n]\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nbut this time there is a term linear in A03 . This linear term suggests that A03 could develop a\nvacuum expectation value (VEV).\nTo correctly determine whether or not a VEV does in fact develop and to understand its\nimplications, it would be necessary to first consistently develop the path integral formulation for\nthe hybrid states considered here. Although the states in (20) are Schroedinger-like in the\n\ndiagonal sector, they are Fock-like in the off-diagonal sector. Construction of the path\nintegral formalism for these states is outside the scope of this paper. However, by\ndrawing parallels with more standard path integral approaches, one may find some clues\nas to what a VEV for A03 could imply.\nIn standard path integral approaches, generated for example by states like those in (6),\nafter one inserts a complete set of momentum states and integrates over the momentum, the\nresulting classical action in the exponent has \"electric\" terms in it like\n1\n2\n\n(F )\n\n1 2\n0i\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n(\u2202\n\n)\n\n2\n\n0\n\nAi1 \u2212 \u2202 i A01 \u2212 gA03 Ai2 + ... .\n\n(23)\n\nIf A03 were to develop a VEV, terms like those above would generate negative mass-squared\nterms for the off-diagonal gauge fields. These negative mass-squared terms could cause some\nspatial components of the off-diagonal gauge fields to also develop VEVs. Those spatial VEVs\nwould generate positive mass-squared terms that would at least offset the negative mass-squared\nterms caused by A03 . The net result of this symmetry breaking and formation of VEVs could be\neffective masses for several of the gauge bosons.\n\nSummary\nSix new classes of BRST-invariant states with finite norms have been explicitly\nconstructed for SU(3) gauge field theory. The new classes represent different ways to\ncanonically quantize SU(3), so only one class can exist in any particular region of space. It may\nbe possible to make different quantization choices in different regions of space, and it would be\ninteresting to explore the physical implications of such a program, particularly to see if they\nwould shed more light on the mechanism behind QCD confinement.\n\n9\n\n\fEach of these new classes of states also breaks the SU(3) symmetry in some way. As a\nconsequence of this symmetry breaking, path integrals derived from the states feature new terms\nin the Hamiltonian that are linear in A03 and A08 . It would be interesting to fully develop the path\nintegral formulation in the context of these states to see if those linear terms would produce gauge\nboson masses as they would in standard path integrals.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
