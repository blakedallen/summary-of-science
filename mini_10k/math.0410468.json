Introduction\nThe Hopf algebra of symmetric functions is a fascinating and well-studied object (though not\nalways -indeed, usually not-studied from the Hopf algebraic point of view). The fact is,\nhowever, that for instance the mere circumstance that it is a (selfdual) Hopf algebra, and, also, a\ncoring object in the category of coalgebras, encodes a great amount of information (such as\nFrobenius reciprocity and the Mackey tensor product formula when it is interpreted as the direct\nsum of the representation rings of the symmetric groups). Whole books have been written about\nthe symmetric functions and their representation theoretic interpretations, and they constitute\narguably one of the most beautiful and best studied objects in mathematics.\nFairly recently two generalizations have appeared: the Hopf algebra of noncommutative\nsymmetric functions, also called the Leibniz Hopf algebra, and its dual the Hopf algebra of\nquasisymmetric functions.\nIt has turned out that much of the structure of the symmetric functions has natural\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n2\n\nanalogues in these generalized settings.However, they are not only studied for generalization's\nsake. The noncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions turn up naturally\nand merit study also on their own account. For instance the noncommutative symmetric\nfunctions turn up as the Solomon descent algebra (see below in section 9 and [3, 11, 45]), and the\nquasisymmetric functions turn up in a variety of combinatorial settings (plane partitions,\ncounting permutations with perscribed descent sets, multiple harmonic series (multiple zeta\nvalues), [14, 15, 23, 46].\nMoreover, as frequently happens, a number of things concerning the symmetric functions\nbecome clearer and more transparent in the noncommutative and/or noncocommutative settings.\nFor instance the matter of the autoduality of the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions and the\nmatter of the second multiplication and the second comultiplication for the symmetric functions.\nThis survey paper is concerned with which of the many properties and structures of the\nsymmetric functions have natural generalizations for the noncommutative symmetric functions.\nand/or the quasisymmetric functions. The survey is an elaboration of two talks I gave on the\nsubject: in June 2001 at the monodromy conference at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in\nMoscow, and in July 2001 in Sumy, Ukraine, at the occasion of the third international algebra\nconference in the Ukraine. It also incorporates some material reported on in November 2000 in\nMoscow at MGU, at the occasion of the O. Schmidt memorial conference.\n2. The Hopf algebra Symm of symmetric functions (over the integers).\nLet's start with the well-known and well studied Hopf algebra of symmetric functions over the\nintegers. As an algebra this is just the polynomial algebra in countably many commuting\nvariables z1 ,z2 ,L\nSymm = Z[z1 ,z2,L] \u2282 Z[\u03be1,\u03be 2,L]\nz1 = \u03be1 + \u03be2 +L\nz2 = \u03be1\u03be2 + \u03be1\u03be3 + \u03be2\u03be3 +L\nL\nzn =\n\n\u2211\u03be\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u03be L\u03bein\n\ni1 i2\ni1 < i2 <L<in\n\ninterpreted as the elementary symmetric functions in countably many commuting variables\n\u03be1 ,\u03be2,L. This point of view incorporates the main theorem of symmetric function theory that\nsymmetric functions are polynomials in the elementary symmetric functions and also the fact\nthat the formula involved does not depend on the number of variables \u03be involved, provided that\nthere are enough of them; see [34], Chapter 1, for some details on this.\nGiving zn weight n turns Symm into a graded algebra (ring)\nSymm = \u2295 Symm n\nn\n\nOne can equally well interpret the zn as being the complete symmetric functions (often\ndenoted by hn )\n\n\u2211\u03be\n\n\u03be L\u03bein\n\ni1 i2\ni1 \u2264 i2 \u2264L\u2264 i n\n\nThe algebra Symm has a (natural in some sense?) Hopf algebra structure as follows.\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n3\n\nBesides the multiplication,\nm: Symm \u2297 Symm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm\n\n(2.3)\n\nand unit (element)\ne: Z\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm\n\n(2.4)\n\nas given by the ring structure (2.1), there is a comultiplication given by\n\u03bc: Symm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm \u2297 Symm, zn a\n\n\u2211z \u2297 z\n\ns +t = n\n\ns\n\nt\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere s and t run over the nonnegative integers and z0 = 1, there is a counit given by\n\u03b5: Symm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Z, zn a 0, n \u2265 1\n\n(2.6)\n\nand there is an antipode determined by\n\u03b9: Symm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm, zn a\n\n\u2211 (-1)\n\nwt( \u03b1 ) =n\n\nlength(\u03b1 )\n\nz\u03b1\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn the last formula \u03b1 = [a1,L,am ], ai \u2208N = {1,2,L} is a word over the integers, often called a\ncomposition in this context, and the weight and length of such a word are wt(\u03b1) = a1 + L+ am ,\nlength(\u03b1) = m. Further z\u03b1 is short for the product z\u03b1 = z a1 za2 Lza m , so that wt(z\u03b1 ) = wt(\u03b1 )\nThe Hopf algebra of symmetric functions (over the integers) has a habit of turning up rather\nfrequently in various parts of mathematics. Here are some of its manifestations.\nSymm = Z[z1 ,z2,L], the algebra of symmetric functions\n.\n\n\u2295R(S ),\nn\n\nn\n\nthe direct sum of the representation rings of the symmetric groups\n\n. Rrat (GL\u221e ), the ring of rational representations of the infinite linear group\n. H* (BU), the cohomology of the classifying space BU\n. H* (BU), the homology of the classifying space BU\n. R(W), the representative ring of the functor of the (big) Witt vectors\n\n(2.8)\n\n. U(\u039b), the universal \u03bb - ring on one generator\n. L\n. L\n. L\nThe ellipses in (2.8) above are not just there for show. They actually refer to a number of other\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n4\n\nknown manifestations such as E(Z), where E is a certain exponential type functor, [24], an\ninterpretation in terms of the K-theory of endomorphisms, an interpretation in terms of\nendomorphisms of polynomial functors, [33], and finally as the free algebra over the cofree\ncoalgebra over one generator and the graded cofree coalgebra1 over the free algebra on one\ngenerator, [19].\nI shall not say much about how the Hopf algebra structure arises in all these cases except in the\ncase of the interpretation of Symm as the direct sum of the representation rings of the symmetric\ngroups: the second manifestation above.\nIn this case Sn is the symmetric group on n letters and R(G) , for a finite group G, is\nthe (Grothendieck) group of (virtual) finite dimensional representations over the complex\nnumbers of G; i.e. the free Abelian group with as basis the irreducible finite dimensional\nrepresentations of G. The weight zero component, R(S0 ), is defined to be equal to Z.\nThe product and the coproduct on the direct sum \u2295 n R(Sn ) are the induction product (also\ncalled Frobenius outer tensor product) and the restriction coproduct, which are defined as\nfollows. Given i and j and n = i + j , view the direct product of groups Si \u00d7 Sj as a (Young)\nsubgroup of Sn in the natural way, i.e. by letting Si act on the first i letters of {1,2,L,n} and\nS j on the second j, i.e. on {i +1,i + 2,L,n}. Let \u03c1,\u03c3 be representations of respectively Si\nand S j . Then their product is\n\u03c1\u03c3 = ind SSni \u00d7 Sj (\u03c1 \u00d7 \u03c3 )\n\n(2.9)\n\nand the coproduct of a representation \u03c4 of Sn is given by\n\u03bc(\u03c4) =\n\n\u2295 res\n\ni+j =n\n\nSn\nS i \u00d7 Sj\n\n(\u03c4)\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe Hopf algebra Symm carries quite a bit more structure (than just the Hopf algebra structure),\nall of it in various ways compatible with the underlying Hopf algebra. A partial enumeration\nfollows.\n\u2022 Hopf algebra structure (with underlying graded ring).\n\u2022 A positive definite inner product ( , ): Symm\u2297 Symm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Z . The Hopf algebra\nstructure is selfdual under this inner product, meaning that\n(x \u2297 y,\u03bc(z )) = (xy, z),\n\n\u2200x, y,z \u2208Symm\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere the inner product on Symm \u2297 Symm is the natural one: (x \u2297 y, x \u2032 \u2297 y \u2032) = (x, x \u2032)(y, y\u2032 ).\nThus Symm as a graded Hopf algebra is isomorphic to its graded dual Hopf algebra\n(autoduality).\n\n\u2022 A second multiplication (with corresponding unit)\n1\n\nBut not the nongraded cofree coalgebra over the free algebra on one generator, see loc. cit.\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n5\n\nmP : Symm \u2297 Symm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm\n\n(2.12)\n\nthat is distributive over the first one in the Hopf algebra sense, which means that\nmP (mS (x \u2297 y),z) = mS ( \u2211 mP (x, z \u2032i ) \u2297 mP (x, zi\u2032\u2032))\n\n(2.13)\n\ni\n\nif \u03bc(z) = \u2211i zi\u2032 \u2297 zi\u2032\u2032 . Here mS is the (first) multiplication of (2.3) above. This makes Symm a\nring object in the category of coalgebras. Well, actually, not quite: the unit element does not live\nin Symm itself but in a certain completion; in fact as a sequence of elements, one in each graded\ncomponent Symmn . The subscripts 'S' and 'P' in mS and mP stand respectively for 'sum' and\n'product' to reflect the fact that for the representable ring valued contravariant functor on the\ncategory of coalgebras\nC a CoAlg(C,Symm)\n\n(2.14)\n\nthe multiplication mS induces the addition on CoAlg(C,Symm) and mP induces the\nmultiplication. The distributivity of multiplication over addition in CoAlg(C,Symm) comes\nfrom (2.13) (and is equivalent to it in the functorial sense). The second multiplication, mP , is\noften called the inner multiplication, especially in the manifestation \u2295 n R(Sn ) of Symm.\n\u2022 A second comultiplication with corresponding counit\n\u03bcP : Symm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm \u2297 Symm\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhich makes Symm a coring object in the category of algebras, meaning that the covariant\nfunctor on the category of rings (= algebras over Z)\nA a Alg(Symm, A)\n\n(2.16)\n\nis ring valued with the addition induced by the comultiplication \u03bcS = \u03bc of (2.5) above and the\nmultiplication induced by \u03bcP . This time there is no 'unit trouble'; there is a perfectly good\nmorphism of Abelian groups \u03b5 P: Symm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Z that plays counit for \u03bcP . In this guise the Hopf\nalgebra Symm is the representative ring of the big Witt vectors\nA \u2192 W(A) = Alg(Symm, A) = Alg(R(W), A)\n\n(2.17)\n\nBy symmetry this second comultiplication should perhaps be called the inner comultiplication,\nbut I have neveer seen that phrase in the published literature. In fact, except in the context of\nWitt vectors, [16], Chapter 3, the second comultiplication on Symm is but rarely discussed, but\nsee [34], pp 128-130.\nThe second multiplication and second comultiplication are dual to each other under the\ninner product.\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n6\n\n\u2022 A \u03bb -ring structure. That is, there are (nonlinear) operations \u03bbi : Symm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm\nwhich behave just like exterior powers (of vector spaces or representations or modules). There\nare associated ring endomorphisms called Adams operators (as in algebraic topology) or power\noperators. Given a ring R with operations \u03bbi : R \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R define operations \u03c8 i: R \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R by\nthe formula\nd\nlog\u03bbt (a) =\ndt\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2211(\u22121) \u03c8\nn\n\nn +1\n\n(a)t n , where \u03bbt (a) =1 + \u03bb1 (a)t + \u03bb2 (a)t 2 +L\n\n(2.18)\n\nn= 0\n\nThen the operations \u03bbi : R \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R for a torsion free ring R turn it into a \u03bb -ring if and only if\ni\nthe Adams operations \u03c8 : R \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R are all ring endomorphisms and in addition satisfy\n\u03c8 1 = id, \u03c8 n\u03c8 m = \u03c8 nm for all n,m \u2208 N = {1,2,L}\n\n(2.19)\n\n([25], p 49ff). A ring R equipped with ring endomorphims \u03c8 i: R \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R such that (2.17)\nholds is called a \u03c8 -ring.\nAt the level of Q[\u03be1,\u03be2 ,L] the Adams operations on Symm are given by \u03bei a \u03bein , which\nexplains the terminology 'power operators' but nicely leaves open the question whether they also\nexist on Symm instead of only on Symm \u2297 Z Q .\n\u2022 A co-\u03bb -coring structure? Everything in sight being dual there is something on Symm that\nshould be called a co-\u03bb -coring structure. However, it is unclear what that could mean. Being\nnonlinear, the \u03bb -operations do not dualize easily. It is of course easy to define what a co-\u03c8 coring would be as the dual of a \u03c8 -ring. But over the integers (over the rationals there is no\nproblem) a \u03c8 -ring is a weaker notion than a \u03bb -ring. Thus a co-\u03bb -coring structure would be\nsomething like a co-\u03c8 -coring with additional integrality properties. It appears that there is a nice\nintegrality question here that deserves investigation.\n\u2022 A contravariant functorial \u03bb -ring structure. This is a clumsy of saying that the functor\n(2.14) is not only ring valued but in fact \u03bb -ring valued; i.e. there is a functorial \u03bb -ring structure\non the W(A) = Alg(Symm, A) .\n\u2022 The dual structure of the one just mentioned, a covariant functorial co-\u03bb -coring structure.\n\u2022 Frobenius and Verschiebungs operators fn and Vn for each n \u2208N . These are Hopf\nalgebra endomorphisms of Symm that have, amoung others, the following properties.\nf1 = V1 = id, fnfm = fnm , VmVn = Vnm\n\n(2.20)\n\nIf gcd(m,n) =1 fn Vm = Vmfn\n\n(2.21)\n\n(fn x, y) = (x, Vn y) for all x, y \u2208 Symm\n\n(2.22)\n\nVn fn = [n]\n\n(2.23)\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n7\n\nHere [n] = [n]Symm , where, for any Hopf algebra H, [n]H is the endomorphism of Abelian\ngroups of H defined by iterated convolution of the identity; i.e. [1]= id and inductively\n\u03bcH\nid\u2297 [ n\u22121]\nmH\n[n] = (H \uf8e7\uf8e7\n\u2192 H \u2297 H \uf8e7\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\u2192 H \u2297 H \uf8e7\uf8e7\n\u2192 H)\n\n(2.24)\n\nWhen H is commutative and cocommutative (as is Symm), [n]H is a Hopf algebra\nendomorphism; otherwise that need not be the case.2 Though as a rule not Hopf algebra\nendomorphisms this family of endomorphisms is well worth studying; there is something\nuniversal about them, see [40, 41].\nBecause of the autoduality of Symm and (2.22) it is necessary to specify which of the two\nfamilies of endomorphisms is to be called Frobenius and which Verschiebungs operators. In this\npaper the weight nondecreasing ones are the Frobenius operators fn .\nOne way of describing them is as follows. The W(A) = Alg(Symm, A) are functorial\n\u03bb -rings and thus have functorial \u03c8 -operations which must come from ring endomorphisms of\nSymm. These are the Frobenius operators on Symm. This is not the standard way of obtaining\nthem, see [16], Chapter 3, and the fact that they can be described this way is a theorem, see loc.\ncit, p. 144 (Adams = Frobenius). They happen also to coincide with the Adams operators coming\nfrom the \u03bb -ring structure on Symm itself (another Adams=Frobenius theorem).\nLet the pn \u2208 Symm be the power sums\npn = \u03be1n + \u03be2n + \u03be3n +L\n\n(2.23)\n\nThen the Frobenius and Verschiebungs operators are determined (as ring endomorphisms) by\n\uf8f10 if n does not divide m\nfn pm = pnm , Vn pm = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3npm / n if n does divide m\n\n(2.24)\n\nThe second part of (2.24) works out as\n\uf8f1 0 if n does not divide m\nVn zm = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3z m/ n if n does divide m\n\n(2.25)\n\nThe Frobenius operators also preserve the second comultiplication, i.e.the product\ncomultiplication \u03bcP (but not the product multiplication mP ), and, dually, the Verschiebungs\noperators preserve mP but not \u03bcP .\nThis finishes a partial enumeration of the various structures on Symm. Various natural questions\narise. For instance are there more objects like this with this much structure. Some partial answers\nto this are in [24, 50]. A good answer would also deal with the question why it is better or more\ninteresting to take the comultiplication (2.5) (if that is the case, as, in fact, I believe), rather then\nthe much simpler comultiplication3\n2\n\nThese endomorphisms are sometimes called Adams operations in the published literature; for instance in\n[10, 13, 32, 39]. This is an unfortunate misnomer as it does not fit with the case H * (BU) = Symm , the classical\noriginal case, where the Adams operations are equal to the Frobenius operations just mentioned. They are discussed\nfurther just below and still more information is in section 5.\n3\n\nThis remark is not supposed to imply in any way that the ring of polynomials over the integers in a\ncountable number of variables with the comultiplication (2.26) is not interesting. On the contrary, the primitives of\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n8\n\nzn a1 \u2297 zn + zn \u2297 1\n\n(2.26)\n\nOver the rationals of course the two Hopf algebras structures on Z[z1 ,z2 ,L] given by (2.5) and\n(2.26) are isomorphic.\nAnother question is to what extent the various structure elements coincide or are otherwise\naccidentally related. There is a good deal of that, partially, I believe, because, as such things go,\nSymm is not very large and there is simply no room.\nStill another question is how all these various structure elements show up in the various\nincarnations of Symm listed in (2.8) above (and inversely). For instance, taking the\nrepresentations of the symmetric groups manifestation of Symm, the Frobenius reciprocity\nformula\nS\n(ind SS i+i \u00d7j S j (\u03c1 \u00d7 \u03c3 ),\u03c4) = (\u03c1 \u2297\u03c3 , res Sii+\u00d7j S j (\u03c4 ))\n\nhas much to do with both the fact that Symm is a Hopf algebra and that it is selfdual; see (2.9),\n(2.10) and (2.11) above. The Mackey tensor product theorem is much related to the distributivity\nof the second multiplication on Symm (the product multiplication mP ) over the first (in the\nsense of Hopf algebras). This comes about because the second multiplication on\nSymm = \u2295 R(Sn ) is in fact given by the multiplication of representations for the individual Sn ,\nn\n\nR(Sn ) \u2297 R(Sn )\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R(Sn ) . Further, for this incarnation of Symm one can ask how the \u03bb -ring\nstructure on Symm looks in representation theoretic terms (outer plethysm problem, see e.g. [4,\n37, 38, 49]. Inversely one can wonder what the exterior products on the individual R(Sn ) mean\nin terms of the Hopf algebra Symm = \u2295 R(Sn ), see [29, 44].\nn\n\nAnother group of questions is to what extent the isomorphisms between the various\nincarnations of Symm are natural; forced so to speak by the various universal and freeness\nproperties the various objects have. For instance \u2295 R(Sn ) and H* (BU) are very nicely related,\nn\n\nsee [30, 31] and also [1, 2]; U(\u039b) , the universal \u03bb -ring on one variable and R(W) , the\nrepresentative ring of the big Witt vectors, are necessarily isomorphic because the \u03bb -rings are\nprecisely the coalgebras for the functorial cotriple W(\u2212) \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 W(W(\u2212)) (on the category of\ncommutative algebras) where the arrow is the functorial morphism \u03bbt coming from the\nfunctorial \u03bb -ring structure on the W(A) (known in the Witt vector world as the Artin-Hasse\nexponential). On the other hand the isomorphism between \u2295 R(Sn ) and U(\u039b) mainly seems\nn\n\nto consist of calculating both to be isomorphic to Symm, [25]; in particular, why is there a Hopf\nalgebra structure on the universal \u03bb -ring on one generator.\nConcerning all these groups of questions I would say that much is known and even more\nstill needs sorting out.\nThis (very partial survey) paper is concerned with noncommutative and/or noncocommutative\ngeneralizations of Symm and to what extent all the structures discussed above have natural\ngeneralizations in these settings. The paper is also concerned with realizations of these\ngeneralizations; for instance in representation theoretic terms.\n3. The Hopf algebra NSymm of noncommutative symmetric functions.\nTwo natural geralizations of Symm more or less recently made their appearance: the Hopf\nthat Hopf algebra form the free Lie algebra over the integers in countably many variables, an object of absorbing\ninterest, see e.g. [43].\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n9\n\nalgebra of noncommutative symmetric functions and its graded dual, the Hopf algebra of\nquasisymmetric functions. As an algebra the Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric\nfunctions over the integers, NSymm, is simply the free algebra in countably many\nindeterminates over Z:\nNSymm = Z\u3008Z1 , Z2,L\u3009\n\n(3.1)\n\nIt is made into a Hopf algebra by the comultiplication\n\u03bc(Zn ) =\n\n\u2211Z\n\ni+j=n\n\ni\n\n\u2297 Z j , where Z0 = 1\n\n(3.2)\n\nand the counit\n\u03b5(Zn ) = 0, n \u22651\n\n(3.3)\n\nThere is an antipode determined by the requirement that it be an anti-endomorphism of rings of\nNSymm and\n\u03b9(Zn ) =\n\n\u2211(\u22121)\n\nlength( \u03b1)\n\nwt( \u03b1) = n\n\nZ\u03b1\n\n(3.4)\n\nHere, as before, \u03b1 is a word over the alphabeth {1,2,L}, \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ], length(\u03b1) = m,\nwt(\u03b1) = a1 + L+ am , and, for later use, \u03b1 t = [am ,L,a2 ,a1 ]. Further Z\u03b1 = Z a1 Za2 LZa m . A\ncomposition \u03b2 = [b1,L,bn ] is a refinement of the composition \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] iff there are\nintegers 1 \u2264 j1 < j2 < L < jm = n such that ai = bj i\u22121 +1 + L+ b ji , where j0 = 0 . For instance the\nrefinements of [3,1] are [3,1], [2,1,1], [1,2,1], and [1,1,1,1]. An explicit formula for the\nanitpode is then\n\u03b9(Z\u03b1 ) =\n\n\u2211 (\u22121)\n\nlength( \u03b2 )\n\n\u03b2 refines \u03b1 t\n\nZ\u03b2\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe variable Zn is given weight n which defines a grading on the Hopf algebra NSymm for\nwhich wt(Z\u03b1 ) = wt(\u03b1 ).\nThis Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions was introduced in the seminal\npaper [12] and extensively studied there and in a slew of subsequent papers such as [7, 9, 22, 26,\n27, 28, 48].\nIt is amazing how much of the theory of symmetric functions has natural analogues for the\nnoncommutative symmetric functions. This includes Schur functions, especially ribbon Schur\nfunctions, Newton primitives (two kinds of analogues of the power sums pn ), Frobenius\nreciprocity, representation theoretic interpretations, determinantal formulae, ... . Some of these\nand others will turn up below. Sometimes these noncommutative analogues are more beautiful\nand better understandable then in the commutative case (as happens frequently); for instance the\nrecursion formula of the Newton primitives and the properties of ribbon Schur functions.\n\n4. The Hopf algebra QSymm of quasisymmetric functions.\nQuasisymmetric functions are a generalization of symmetric functions introduced some 18 years\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n10\n\nago to deal with the combinatorics of P-partitions and the counting of permutations with given\ndescent sets, [14, 15], see also [46].\nLet X be a finite or infinite set (of variables) and consider the ring of polynomials, R[X] ,\nand the ring of power series, R[[X]] , over a commutative ring R with unit element in the\ncommuting variables from X. A polynomial or power series f (X) \u2208 R[[X]] is called symmetric\nif for any two finite sequences of indeterminates X1, X2 ,L, Xn and Y1 ,Y2 ,L,Yn from X and any\nsequence of exponents i1,i2 ,L,in \u2208N , the coefficients in f (X) of X1i1 X2i2 LX nin and\nY1i1Y2i2 LYnin are the same.\nThe quasi-symmetric formal power series are a generalization introduced by Gessel, [14],\nin connection with the combinatorics of plane partitions. This time one takes a totally ordered set\nof indeterminates, e.g. V = {V1,V2 ,L}, with the ordering that of the natural numbers, and the\ncondition is that the coefficients of X1i1 X2i2 LX nin and Y1i1Y2i2 LYnin are equal for all totally\nordered sets of indeterminates X1 < X2 <L < Xn and Y1 < Y2 < L< Yn . Thus, for example,\nX1X 22 + X2 X32 + X1 X32\n\n(4.1)\n\nis a quasi-symmetric polynomial in three variables that is not symmetric.\nProducts and sums of quasi-symmetric polynomials and power series are again quasisymmetric (obviously), and thus one has, for example, the ring of quasi-symmetric power series\nQSymm ^ in countably many commuting variables over the integers and its subring\nQSymm\n\n(4.2)\n\nof quasi-symmetric polynomials in finite of countably many indeterminates, which are the\nquasi-symmetric power series of bounded degree.\nGiven a word \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] over N, also called a composition in this context, consider\nthe quasi-monomial function\n\n\u2211X\n\nM\u03b1 =\n\ni 1 <L <im\n\na1\ni1\n\nXia2 2 LXi amm\n\n(4.3)\n\ndefined by \u03b1 . These form a basis over the integers of QSymm as a free Abelian group. Below I\nshall usually write \u03b1 instead of M\u03b1 ; i.e. no distinction is made between a word or composition\nand the quasimonomial it defines.\nThe monomials Z\u03b1 , \u03b1 a composition, form an Abelian group basis for NSymm. Thus\none can set up a duality by requiring\n\u3008Z\u03b1 , \u03b2\u3009 = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 (Kronecker delta)\n\n(4.4)\n\nIt turns out, as is easily checked, that under this pairing the coproduct of NSymm exactly\ncorreponds to the product of quasisymmetric functions:\n\u3008\u03bc(Z\u03b1 ),\u03b2 \u2297 \u03b3 \u3009 = \u3008Z\u03b1 ,\u03b2\u03b3 \u3009\n\n(4.5)\n\nExplicitely, in terms of compositions, the product of QSymm is the overlapping shuffle product,\nwhich can be described as follows. Let \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] and \u03b2 = [b1,b2 ,L,bn ] be two\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n11\n\ncompositions or words. Take a 'sofar empty' word with n + m \u2212 r slots where r is an integer\nbetween 0 and min{m, n}, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 min{m,n} .\nChoose m of the available n + m \u2212 r slots and place in it the natural numbers from \u03b1 in their\noriginal order; choose r of the now filled places; together with the remaining\nn + m \u2212 r \u2212 m = n \u2212 r places these form n slots; in these place the entries from \u03b2 in their orginal\norder; finally, for those slots which have two entries, add them. The product of the two words \u03b1\nand \u03b2 is the sum (with multiplicities) of all words that can be so obtained. So, for instance\n[a,b][c, d] = [a,b,c,d] +[a,c,b,d] +[a,c,d,b]+ [c,a,b, d] + [c,a,d,b] + [c,d, a,b] +\n+[a + c, b, d] + [a + c,d,b] +[c,a + d,b] + [a,b + c,d] +[a,c,b + d] +\n+[c,a,b + d] + [a + c,b + d]\n\n(4.6)\n\nand [1][1][1]=6[1,1,1]+3[1,2]+3[2,1]+[3]. It is easy to see that the recipe given above gives\nprecisely the multiplication of (the corresponding basis) quasi-symmetric functions. The shuffles\nof a1,L,am ;b1 ,L,bn correspond to the products of the monomials in M\u03b1 and M\u03b2 that have no\nX j in common; the other terms arise when one or more of the X' s in the monomials making up\nM\u03b1 and M\u03b2 do coincide. In example (4.6) the first six terms are the shuffles; the other terms are\n'overlapping shuffles'. The term shuffle comes from the familiar rifle shuffle of cardplaying; an\noverlapping shuffle occurs when one or more cards from each deck don't slide along each other\nbut stick edgewise together; then their values are added.\nNote that the empty word, [], serves as the unit element.\nThe multiplication of NSymm, under the duality pairing (4.4) defines a comultiplication on\nQSymm which turns out to be 'cut' (obviously):\n\u03bc([a1,L, am ]) = []\u2297 [a1,L, am ] + [a1]\u2297 [a2 ,L,am ] + [a1,a2 ] \u2297[a3 ,L,am ] +\n+L +[a1 ,L,am \u22121 ]\u2297 [am ]+ [a1,L, am ]\u2297 []\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe free Abelian group QSymm with as basis the compositions, equipped with the overlapping\nshuffle multiplication as multiplication and cut, (4.7), as comultiplication is a Hopf algebra (there\nare also a counit and an antipode). As a Hopf algebra it is the graded dual of the Hopf algebra\nNSymm.\nActually it first turned up in 1972 (or earlier) precisely in this form , i.e. as the graded dual\nof NSymm, see [6]. This was before the term 'quasisymmetric function' was coined.\n5. The richness of Symm and the need to unfold. Adams = Frobenius.\nConsider the functor on commutative rings (algebras), A a Alg(Symm, A) = W(A). An element\nof W(A) is uniquely determined by the images of the zi , i =1,2,L ; i.e by a sequence r1 ,r2 ,L\nof elements of A, which in turn can be identified with a power series with starting term 1\n1 + r1t + r2t 2 + L\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe addition on W(A) (which comes from the sum (=first) comultiplication \u03bcS of Symm) now\nobviously becomes multiplication of such power series.\nTake a set of commuting indeterminates x1,x 2,L and introduce formal variables \u03be1 ,\u03be2,L\nsuch that\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n12\n\n\u221e\n\n\u220f (1\u2212\u03be t) = 1 + x t + x t\ni\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+L\n\n(5.2)\n\ni=1\n\nso that the xi are plus or minus the elementary symmetric functions in the \u03be 's. Similarly, let\n\u221e\n\n\u220f (1\u2212\u03b7 t) =1 + y t + y t\ni\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+L\n\n(5.3)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the y's are a second set of commuting indeterminates (that also commute with the x's).\nConsider the two expressions\n\u221e\n\n\u220f(1\u2212 \u03be \u03b7 t) = 1+ P (x, y)t + P (x, y)t\n\ni , j =1\n\ni\n\n\u221e\n\nj\n\n\u220f (1\u2212\u03be\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+L\n\nt) = 1+ Q1n (x)t + Q2n (x)t 2 +L\n\nn\ni\n\n(5.4)\n\n(5.5)\n\ni=1\n\nThe left hand sides of these two expressions are obviously symmetric in the \u03be 's and \u03b7 's so\nthat there are universal polynomials in the x and y such that (5.4) and (5.5) hold. These universal\npolynomials define the functorial multiplication and Frobenius operations on the W(A) , so that\nthe product comultiplication (=second comultiplication) on Symm is given by\n\u03bcP (zi ) = Pi (1\u2297 z, z \u22971)\n\n(5.6)\n\nand the Frobenius operators on Symm are given by\nfn : zi a Qin (z)\n\n(5.7)\n\nIt is now the case (and the above is practically a proof of that) that on Symm three things\ncoincide:\n\u2022 the Adams operators on Symm that come from the \u03bb -ring structure on Symm\n\u2022 the ring endomorphisms of Symm that induce the functorial Adams operators on the\nfunctorial \u03bb -rings W(A) = Alg(Symm, A) (a higher order \u03bb -ring structure so to speak).\n\u2022 the ring endomorphisms of Symm that induce the functorial Frobenius operators on the\nWitt vector rings W(A) .\nI consider this an example of 'squeezed togetherness', caused by the fact that Symm is not\nparticularly large, and hopefully things will separate out in suitable ways for appropriate\ngeneralizations of Symm.\nThe Hopf algebra Symm represents the Abelian group valued functor A a 1+ tA[[t]] (as seen\nabove). One can also consider power series starting with 1 with coefficients in a noncommutative\nring and multiply such power series in the obvious way giving a noncommutative group valued\nfunctor B a1 + tB[[t]] . This functor is obviously represented by the Hopf algebra NSymm.\n\nWhether there exists anything like a second comultiplication or Frobenius operators on\nNSymm along the lines above for Symm is a completely open question. Possibly some of the\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n13\n\nspecializations (=realizations) of NSymm discussed in [7, 12, 22, 26, 27, 28, 48] will give\nsomething.\n6. The autoduality of Symm\nConsider the duality pairing (4.4) between NSymm and QSymm. On the one hand we have\nSymm as a quotient Z[z1 ,z2 ,L] of NSymm = Z\u3008Z1 , Z2,L\u3009 , the quotient mapping being given\nby Zi a zi . On the other hand the algebra of quasisymmetric functions contains a copy of the\nsymmetric functions. A basis (as an Abelian group) is formed by the symmetrized\nquasisymmetric functions\n\u03b1 sym = [a1,a2 ,L,am ]sym =\n\n1\n\u2211[a ,a ,L,a\u03c3 ( m )]\n# G\u03b1 \u03c3 \u2208S m \u03c3 (1) \u03c3 (2)\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere\nG\u03b1 = {\u03c3 \u2208 Sm : [a\u03c3 (1) ,a\u03c3 (2) ,L,a\u03c3( m ) ] =[a1 ,a2 ,L,am ]}\n\n(6.2)\n\nis the stabilizer subgroup of \u03b1 . For instance\n[1,1,3]sym = [1,1,3] +[1,3,1]+ [3,1,1]\n\n(6.3)\n\nThese are the socalled monomial symmetric functions. It is not difficult to show that under the\nduality NSymm - QSymm the quotient module Z[z1 ,z2 ,L] coresponds to the submodule\nspanned by the \u03b1 sym . And so, as the duality is one of Hopf algebras, it follows from general\nconsiderations (as in [47] for example) that the quotient module of the one and the submodule of\nthe other are dual as Hopf algebras.\nOn the other hand, by the main theorem on symmetric functions the subalgebra of\nsymmetric functions of the algebra of quaissymmetric functions is the free commutative algebra\nin the elementary symmetric functions, Z[e1,e2 ,L] , where en is the quasisymmetric function\nen = [1,1,L,1\n123 ]\n\n(6.4)\n\nn\n\nThus as algebras the subalgebra Z[e1,e2 ,L] of QSymm and the quotient algebra Z[z1 ,z2 ,L] of\nNSymm are isomorphic. Finally the comultiplication of QSymm is 'cut', see (4.7), so that the\ninduced comultiplication on Z[e1,e2 ,L] is given by\n\u03bc(en ) =\n\n\u2211e \u2297 e ,\n\ni+ j =n\n\ni\n\nj\n\ne0 = 1\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhich fits perfectly with the comultiplication on Z[z1 ,z2 ,L], see (2.5). Thus the two are\nisomorphic as Hopf algebras and dual as Hopf algebras. This is a particularly smooth way to\nobtain this duality which is not so evident at the level of Symm itself.\nUsing the isomorphism zn a en the duality defines an nondegenerate bilinear form ( , ) on\nSymm. This one turns out to be symmetric. This can be obtained as a consequence of the fact that\nthe second comultiplication on Symm is commutative. To get the standard positive definite inner\nproduct on Symm interprete the zn as the complete symmetric functions (not the elementary\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n14\n\nsymmetric functions, see (2.2)).\n7. Polynomial freeness properties\nThe Hopf algebra of symmetric functions, being isomorphic to its dual, has the polynomial\nfreeness property that its graded dual is a free commutative polynomial algebra over the integers.\nThis generalizes to NSymm.The graded dual of NSymm, which is QSymm, is a free\ncommutative polynomial algebra over the integers. For two different proofs of this see [18, 20].\nThis was originaly conjectured by Ditters in 1972, and plays an important role in the parts\nof the theory of classification of noncommutative formal groups developed by him and his\nstudents. See [17] for a brief outline.\nThe second proof of the Ditters conjecture in [20] proceeds via an explicit recursive\ndescription of (an Abelian group basis of) the Lie algebra of primitives of NSymm that is the\nnoncommutative analogue of the Abelian Lie algebra of primitives of Symm, which has the\npower sums pn as a basis.\n\n8. The MPR Hopf algebra.\nThis algebra has been defined by Malvenuto, Poirier, and Reutenauer in [35, 42], whence the\nname. Practically all the material in this section comes from loc. cit.\nAs an Abelian group the MPR Hopf algebra is the direct sum of the group rings over the\nintegers of the symmetric groups\nMPR = ZS = \u2295 ZSn\nn\u22650\n\n(8.1)\n\nwith ZS0 = Z with the empty word as generator. Permutations are written as words with the\nword corresponding to a permutation \u03c3 \u2208Sn being the word [\u03c3 (1),\u03c3(2),L,\u03c3(n)] of length n.\nA first product is defined on MPR as follows. Let \u03c3 \u2208Sm and \u03c4 \u2208Sn be two permutations.\nConsider the word \u03c4 = [m + b1, m + b2 ,L,m + bn ], then the product is (the sum of permutations\ncorresponding to) the sum of words\nmMPR (\u03c3 ,\u03c4) = \u03c3 \u00d7sh \u03c4\n\n(8.2)\n\nwhere \u00d7 sh is the shuffle product4. For a word \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] without repeated letters let\nst(\u03b1) be the word [b1 ,b2 ,L,bm ], bi \u2208{1,L,m} of the same length such that ai < aj if and only\nif bi < bj (so that st(\u03b1) is a permutation). The coproduct \u03bcMPR on MPR is now defined as\n\u03bcMPR (\u03c3) =\n\n\u2211 st(\u03b1)\u2297 st(\u03b2 )\n\n(8.3)\n\n\u03b1 \u2217\u03b2 = \u03c3\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2217 \u03b2 is the concatenation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 .\nThen (MPR,m MPR, \u03bcMPR ) is a Hopf algebra. (There are also unit, counit, and antipode,\nwhich can be easily proved to exist; they are not explicitely given here.)\n4\n\nThe shuffle product is the like the overlapping shuffle product from section 4 except that no overlaps are\nallowed. In detail. Let \u03b1 =[a1 ,a2 ,L,am ] and \u03b2 = [b1 ,b2 ,L,bn ] be two compositions or words. Take a 'sofar\nempty' word with n + m slots. Choose m of the available n + m slots and place in it the natural numbers from \u03b1 in\ntheir original order; in the remaining n slots place the entries from \u03b2 in their orginal order. The product of the two\nwords \u03b1 and \u03b2 is the sum (with multiplicities) of all words that can be so obtained.\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n15\n\nThere is a second Hopf algebra structure defined on MPR as follows. For a permutation\n\u03c3 \u2208Sn and a subset I of {1,L,n} let \u03c3 I be the word obtained from \u03c3 by removing all letters\nthat are not in I . For a word \u03b1 over the integers let alph(\u03b1) , the alphabeth of \u03b1 , be the\ncollection of letters that occur in \u03b1 . Now define for \u03c3 \u2208Sm , \u03c4 \u2208Sn\nmMPR\n\u2032 (\u03c3 ,\u03c4) =\n\n\u2211\u03b1 \u2217 \u03b2\n\n(8.4)\n\nwhere the sum is over all words \u03b1,\u03b2 , such that st(\u03b1) = \u03c3 , st(\u03b2) = \u03c4 , and\nalph(\u03b1) \u222a alph(\u03b2) = {1,2,L,m + n}, and define for \u03c3 \u2208Sn\nn\n\n\u03bcMPR\n\u2032 (\u03c3 ) = \u2211 \u03c3 {1,L,i} \u2297 st(\u03c3 {i +1,L,n} )\n\n(8.5)\n\ni=0\n\nThen (MPR, m \u2032MPR, \u03bcMPR\n\u2032 ) is also a Hopf algebra.\nDefine an inner product on MPR by making the permutations an orthonormal basis. Then\nthe two Hopf algebra structures are dual to each other, i.e.\n\u3008mMPR (x, y),z\u3009 = \u3008x \u2297 y, \u03bcMPR\n\u2032 (z)\u3009\n\u3008 mMPR\n\u2032 (x, y),z\u3009 = \u3008x \u2297 y, \u03bcMPR (z)\u3009\n\n(8.6)\n\nThe two Hopf algebras are also isomorphic, the isomorphism being given by assigning to a\npermutation its inverse.\nFinally, as an algebra (both ways), MPR is a free noncommutative algebra over the\nintegers.\nThis Hopf algebra generalizes both NSymm, in the sense that NSymm is a sub Hopf algebra of\n(MPR, m \u2032MPR, \u03bcMPR\n\u2032 ) and QSymm, in the sense that QSymm is a quotient Hopf algebra of\n(MPR,m MPR, \u03bcMPR ).\nThus the question arises which of the many structures on and properties of Symm have\ngood analogues on MPR. Very little is known. But, for instance, there are both a natural second\ncomultiplication and a natural second multiplication, which, however, are not distributive over\nthe first comultiplication, respectively the first multiplication, (in the Hopf algebra sense of\ncourse), see [21]. On the other hand the second multiplication on MPR induces the right second\nmultiplication on NSymm as a sub Hopf algebra of (MPR, m \u2032MPR, \u03bcMPR\n\u2032 ) and the second\ncomultiplication on MPR induces right second comultiplication on on QSymm as a quotient\nalgebra of (MPR,m MPR, \u03bcMPR ). These last two observations are new and do not come from [35,\n42].\nThis second multiplication on NSymm is described below in section 9; the second\ncomultiplication on QSymm is described below in section 12.\n\n9. Three representation theoretic interpretations of NSymm.\n9A. One of the nice and important things about Symm is its representation theoretic\ninterpretation as \u2295 n R(Sn ) with the induction product and the restriction coproduct, see section\n2 above. This generalizes to NSymm in a very nice way. Most of the material in this subsection\ncomes from [8, 27, 48].\nThe n-th Hecke algebra is the algebra Hn (q) over the complex numbers generated by\nsymbols T1 ,T2 ,L,Tn\u2212 1 subject to the relations\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n16\n\nTi2 = (q \u2212 1)Ti + q, for i = 1,L,n \u22121\nTiTi +1Ti = Ti +1TiTi +1 , for i = 1,L,n \u2212 2\n\n(9.1)\n\nTiTj = T jTi , for i, j \u2208{1,L,n \u2212 1} and i \u2212 j \u2265 2\nThis is not quite the standard parametrization (which has q \u2212 q \u2212 1 instead of q). This one has the\nadvantage that one can set q = 0 (crystallization) to obtain the Hecke algebras at zero. For q = 1\none finds the group algebras of the symmetric groups, C[Sn ], and for generic q unequal to zero\nor a root of unity, the algebra Hn (q) is isomorphic to C[Sn ] (and hence semisimple). Hn (0) is\nnot semisimple for n \u2265 3 .\nThe theorem is now that the algebra NSymm is isomorphic to the K-theory of the Hecke\nalgebras at zero. More precisely\nNSymm = Z\u3008Z1 , Z2,L\u3009 .\n\n\u2295 K(H (0))\n\n(9.2)\n\nn\n\nn\n\nHere, for a ring A, K( A) is the Grothendieck group of finitely generated projective A-modules.\nAnd the product is the induction product\nind HHii +(0)j (0)\u2297 H j (0)\n\n(9.3)\n\nfor the natural and obvious imbedding Hi (0) \u2297 H j (0) \u2282 Hi+ j (0) . For details see loc. cit. For the\nrepresentation theory of the Hecke algebras at zero see [5, 36].\nA small complement is that in fact the isomorphism given in [8, 27, 48] is an isomorphism\nof Hopf algebras if the direct sum on the right of (9.2) is given the restriction comultiplication\nresHHii +(0)j (0)\u2297 H j (0)\n\n(9.4)\n\nWhat I do not know is how to describe the quotient morphism of Hopf algebras\nNSymm \u2192 Symm , Zi a zi , in representation theoretic terms. That is, how to explicitely fill in\nthe missing right hand arrow in the diagram below. This arrow should reflect the explosion of\nrepresentations that takes place at zero. Or, equivalently, a collapse: as a certain parameter\nbecomes nonzero a lot of modules suddenly become isomorphic, which were not isomorphic at\nzero.\nNSymm = Z\u3008Z1 , Z2,L\u3009\n\n\uf8e7\n\uf8e7~\u2192\n\n\u2193\nSymm = Z[z1 ,z2 ,L]\n\n\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192\n~\n\n\u2295 K(H (0))\nn\n\nn\n\n\u2295 R(S )\nn\n\n(9.5)\n\nn\n\nOther open questions are:\n\u2022 whether there is a natural Hopf algebra structure on the Hn (0) which would induce the\nsecond multiplication on NSymm. (There is such a second multiplication on NSymm, see below\nin section 9B, which is left distributive over the first one (in the Hopf algebra sense) but not right\ndistributive.)\n\u2022 what do the exterior power operations on Hn (0) -modules mean for NSymm, and what\nare the corresponding Adams operations?\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n17\n\n9B. The Solomon descent algebras.\nGiven a permutation \u03c3 \u2208Sn its descent set Desc(\u03c3 ) \u2282 {1,L,n \u2212 1} is the set\nDesc(\u03c3 ) ={i \u2208{1,L,n \u22121}: \u03c3 (i) >\u03c3 (i + 1)}\n\n(9.6)\n\nFor a given subset A \u2282{1,L,n \u2212 1}, consider the sum of permutations with that descent set,\nD= A =\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 ZSn\n\nDesc( \u03c3 ) = A\n\nIt has been shown by Solomon, see [45], that the D= A generate a subalgebra of ZSn . More\nprecisely there are nonnegative integers (which can be explicitely described in terms of double\ncosets), such that\nD= A D= B =\n\n\u2211d\n\nC\nA, B\n\nD=C\n\n(9.7)\n\nC\n\ngiving a subalgebra of the group algebra ZSn denoted D(Sn ) and called the Solomon descent\nalgebra. These are a kind of noncommutative representation theory. For a lot of information on\nthe Solomon descent algebras, see [3, 11].\nIt is now a theorem of Gessel, Malvenuto, and Reutenauer, see [14, 35], that the direct sum\nof the Solomon descent algebras with a suitable product (not the direct sum product of the\nproducts just defined) is dual to QSymm. In other words that there is an isomorphism of algebras\nNSymm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7~ \u2192 \u2295 D(Sn )\n\n(9.8)\n\nn\n\nEach element of a D(Sn ) is by definition an element of the Abelian group MPR of the previous\nsection. This gives a natural embedding of Abelian groups\n\n\u2295 D(S\n\nn\n\nn\n\nIt turns out that\n\n) \u2282 MPR\n\n\u2295 D(S\nn\n\nn\n\n(9.9)\n\n) is stable under the mutiplication and comultiplication of the Hopf\n\nalgebra (MPR, m \u2032MPR, \u03bcMPR\n\u2032 ). Giving \u2295 D(Sn ) the induced multiplication and comultiplication\nn\n\nturns it into a Hopf algebra and then (9.8) is an isomorphism of Hopf algebras. Moreover, there\nis a second multiplication on \u2295 D(Sn ), viz the direct sum multiplication of the multiplications\nn\n\non the individual D(Sn ) . By transfer of structure via (9.9) this gives a second multiplication on\nNSymm which is left distributive over the first one (in the Hopf algebra sense) but not right\ndistributive. (NB in [12], section 5, the opposite second multiplication is used.). There results a\ncommutative diagram of ring objects in the category of coalgebras as follows\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n18\n\nNSymm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7~ \u2192\n\n\u2295 D(S )\nn\n\nn\n\n\u2193\nSymm\n\n\u2193\n\uf8e7\n\uf8e7~\u2192\n\n(9.10)\n\n\u2295 R(S )\nn\n\nn\n\nThere is an explicit straightforward description of the right hand arrow in (9.10) in [45].\n9C. There is a third representation theoretic interpretation of NSymm giving an isomorphism of\nrings\nNSymm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7~ \u2192 \u2295 G(Hn (0))\n\n(9.11)\n\nn\n\nwhere for a ring A, G(A) is the Grothendieck group of finitely generated A-modules (not\nnecessarily projective) with a relation [M] = [ M \u2032] + [ M \u2032\u2032 ] for all exact sequences\n0\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 M\u2032 \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 M \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 M \u2032\u2032 \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 0\n\n(9.12)\n\nThus, G(A) is the Abelian group of equivalence classes of finitely generated A-modules with\n[M1 ] = [M2 ] if and only if M1 and M2 have the same composition factors.\nThe product is what I call the projection product. It is defined as follows. There is a natural\nprojection of rings\n\u03c0\n\nHi + j (0) \uf8e7\uf8e7ij \u2192 Hi (0) \u2297 H j (0)\n\n(9.13)\n\ngiven by\nTk a Tk \u22971, for k = 1,L,i \u2212 1\nTi a 0\nTi+ l a 1\u2297 Tl , for l = 1,L, j \u22121\n\n(9.14)\n\nSuch a projection only exist at zero. Thus a representation of Hi (0) \u2297 H j (0) gives a\nrepresentation of Hi + j (0) and this is the product on the right hand side of (9.11). I do not know\nof a natural coproduct on the right hand side of (9.11) that would make (9.11) an isomorphism of\nHopf algebras. Of course, restriction does not work.\n\n10. Representation theoretic interpretation of QSymm.\nThis is the dual of the representation theoretic description of NSymm in section 9A above. It\ntakes the form of an isomorphism of rings\nQSymm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7~\u2192 \u2295 G(Hn (0))\nn\n\n(10.1)\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n19\n\nwhere, as in 9A, the product on the right hand side is the induction product. But note that here\none needs to use the Grothendieck groups G(Hn (0)) (defined in 9C above) instead of\ntheGrothendieck groups K(Hn (0)) which were used for NSymm. For details see [8, 27, 48]. This\nhas to do with the fact that the Hecke algebras at zero are not semisimple (so that the G and K\nfunctors on these algebras are not the same (but dual instead)).\nAgain, the isomorphism is an isomorphism of Hopf algebras.\n11. Automorphisms and endomorphisms of Symm, NSymm, and QSymm.\n11A. Automorphisms\nThe group of weight preserving Hopf algebra automorphisms of Symm, i.e. automorphisms of\nthe graded Hopf algebra Symm, is quite small. Indeed, [30, 31]\nhAut Hopf (Symm). V4\n\n(11.1)\n\nthe Klein 4-group. Explicitely, the automorphisms are the identity, the morphism of rings that\ntakes the elementary symmetric functions to the complete symmetric functions en a hn , the\nantipode, and the product of these two last ones. This is very much a result over the integers.\nOver the rationals the group of Hopf algebra automorphisms of Symm is quite large.\nIf one takes the second multiplication into account, or rather its unit (or, equivalently, the\ncounit of the second comultiplication) the group reduces to the identity\nhAut HopfRing (Symm). {id}\n\n(11.2)\n\nIn fact the four elements of hAut Hopf (Symm) correspond to the four ways one can choose a unit\nfor the second multiplication on Symm (or, better, a counit for the second comultiplication on\nSymm).\nHere, from the point of view of homogeneous automorphisms, NSymm differs very much\nfrom Symm (and hence so does QSymm). The group hAut Hopf (NSymm) is very large indeed.\nI know very little about the automorphisms of NSymm that also preserve the second\nmultiplication on NSymm, i.e. the group hAut HopfRing (NSymm) , but suspect it to be quite small,\npossibly even trivial.\n11B. Endomorphisms.\nLet H be a Hopf algebra. A divided power series (DPS) in H is a sequence of elements\nd0 = 1,d1,d2 ,L such that \u03bc H (dn ) =\n\n\u2211d \u2297d\n\ni+j=n\n\ni\n\nj\n\n(11.3)\n\nA DPS is often written as a power series d(t) = 1+ d1t + d2 t2 +L .\nLet CoF(Z) be the graded cofree coalgebra over\nCoF(Z) = \u2295ZZn , Z0 =1\nn\u22650\n\nZ. As an Abelian group CoF(Z) is\n(11.4)\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n20\n\nThe comultiplication and counit are\n\u03bc(Zn ) =\n\n\u2211Z\n\ni+j=n\n\ni\n\n\u2297 Zj ,\n\n\u03b5(Z0 ) = 1, \u03b5(Zn ) = 0 for n \u22651\n\n(11.5)\n\nThus Symm is the commutative free algebra over CoF(Z) and NSymm is the free\n(noncommutative) algebra over CoF(Z), and they inherit their comultiplications from CoF(Z).\nA coalgebra morphism from CoF(Z) to a Hopf algebra H is the same as a DPS in H. The\ncorrespondence is given by \u03c6 (Zi ) = di .\nHence, because of the freeness properties of Symm and NSymm, a DPS in a Hopf algebra\nH is the same as a morphism of Hopf algebras NSymm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 H and if H is commutative this\nis also the same as a morphism of Hopf algebras Symm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 H .\nNow consider the following power series with coefficients in QSymm \u2297 NSymm\n\u0393(t) = \u2211 \u03b1Z\u03b1t wt( \u03b1)\n\n(11.6)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere the sum is over all words in the alphabeth N, i.e. all compositions, including the empty\nword (so that the power series starts with 1). \u0393(t) is both a DPS of NSymm with coefficients in\nQSymm and a DPS of QSymm with coefficients in NSymm. But it is not a DPS over Z of the\ntensor product Hopf algebra QSymm \u2297 NSymm . I call it the universal DPS of NSymm.\nA DPS of NSymm is called homogeneous or, better, isobaric, if wt(di ) = i . Given a\nhomomorphism of rings \u03c6: QSymm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 A\n\u03c6 \u2217\u0393(t) = \u2211 \u03c6(\u03b1)Z\u03b1 t\u03b1\n\n(11.7)\n\n\u03b1\n\nis an isobaric DPS of NSymm over A, i.e. a DPS in NSymm \u2297Z A . Inversely every isobaric\nDPS is obtained this way. Whence the terminology 'universal'.\nIn particular\nhEnd Hopf (NSymm) = Alg(QSymm,Z)\nhEndHopf (Symm) = Alg(Symm,Z)\n\n(11.8)\n\nand thus, because Symm and QSymm are free commutative algebras over Z with countably\nmany generators, the homogenous Hopf endomorphism groups of Symm and NSymm are quite\nlarge.\nThere is a similar sort of universal DPS for any (graded) Hopf algebra and it does not\nmatter which basis (and corresponding dual basis) is chosen.\n\n12. Second (co)multiplications on Symm, NSymm, and QSymm.\nThe second multiplication on NSymm (and on Symm) has already been discussed and\ndescribed. Dually, there is a second comultiplication on QSymm. Here is an explicit description\nof it.\nLet \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] be a composition (= word over N). A (0,\u03b1) -matrix is a matrix\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n21\n\nwhose entries are either zero or one of the ai , which has no zero columns or zero rows and in\nwhich the entries a1,a2 ,L,am occur in their original order if one orders the entries of a matrix\nby first going left to right through the first row, then left to right through the second row, etc.\nFor a matrix M let uc (M) be the vector of column sums and ur (M) the vector of row\nsums. For instance\n\uf8eb 0 1 0 3\uf8f6\nM = \uf8ec\uf8ec 1 2 0 1\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed0 0 1 0\uf8f8\n\n(12.1)\n\nis a (0,[1,3,1,2,1,1])- matrix with uc (M) = [1,3,1,4] and ur (M) = [4,4,1] .\nThe second comultiplication on QSymm is now given by\n\u03bcP (\u03b1) =\n\n\u2211 u (M) \u2297u (M)\n\nc\nM is a\n(0, \u03b1 )\u2212 matrix\n\nr\n\n(12.2)\n\nRestricted to Symm \u2282 QSymm , this describes the second comultiplication on Symm (which\ndefines the Witt vecor multiplication, a notoriously difficult thing to get an explicit hold on) for\nthe polynomial generators en in terms of (0,1)-matrices. The formula is quite simple (but needs\nsome notation not yet introduced here).\nThe second multiplication on QSymm (resp. Symm) induces a functorial multiplication on\nM(A) = Alg(QSymm, A) (resp. W(A) = Alg(Symm, A) ) for any ring A. By what has been said in\nsection 11 above Alg(QSymm, A) is the ring of homogeneous Hopf algebra endomorphism over\nA of NSymm \u2297 A . One can wonder to what the multiplication on Alg(QSymm, A) coming from\nthe second comultiplication on QSymm corresponds in terms of endomorphisms. It turns out\nthat this is simply composition of endomorphisms. This gives a highly satisfactory explanation of\nwhere the second comultiplication on QSymm and Symm (and hence the functorial Witt vector\nmultiplication) really come from.\n\n13. Frobenius and Verschiebungs morphisms on Symm, NSymm, and QSymm.\nFrobenius and Verschiebungs morphisms on Symm have already been discussed above in section\n2.\nOn NSymm there are natural Verschiebungs morphims which lift the ones on Symm and\nwhich are clearly the right ones. They are the Hopf algebra endomorphisms given by\n\uf8f1 0 if n does not divide m\nVn (Zm ) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3 Z m/ n if n does divide m\n\n(13.1)\n\nDually, on QSymm there are natural Frobenius morphisms, which are Hopf algebra\nendomorphism, and restrict to the ones on Symm. They are given by\nfn ([a1, a2 ,L,am ]) = [na1,na2 ,L,nam ]\n\n(13.2)\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n22\n\nThey also have the Frobenius like property that\nf p (\u03b1) \u2261 \u03b1 p mod p\n\n(13.3)\n\nfor all prime numbers p. Also they are the Adams morphisms corresponding to a \u03bb -ring\nstructure on QSymm (so that the unfolding asked for in section 5 above has not yet happened).\nTo what extent there are (canonical?) Frobenius morphisms on NSymm and corresponding\nVerschiebungs morphism on QSymm is still unclear (and a rather important question). There are\nin any case very many Frobenius like morphisms on QSymm. They are obtained as follows.\nChoose a free polynomial basis of QSymm of homogeneous elements, and, for convenience, see\nto it that it includes the (canonical) generators en , the elementary symmetric functions, of Symm.\nThis can be done, see [17, 18, 20]. Let \u03a6 \u2282 QSymm be this set of basis elements. Then there is\nan associated Frobenius-type morphism f\u03c6 of NSymm for every \u03c6 \u2208\u03a6 .\nIt is obtained as follows. Consider the morphism of algebras QSymm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Z that takes \u03c6\nto 1 and all other elements of \u03a6 to zero. Apply this morphism of algebras to the universal\nDPS (11.7), The resulting DPS of NSymm is of the form\nd0 = 1,0,0,L,0\n1\n424\n3 ,dn ,0,0,L,0\n1\n424\n3 , d2 n,L\nn\u2212 1\n\n(13.4)\n\nn \u22121\n\nwhere n = wt(\u03c6) and dkn is of weight kn. It follows that\nd0 = 1,dn, d2 n,L\n\n(13.5)\n\nis also a DPS. The Frobenius like Hopf algebra endomorphism associated to \u03c6 is now given by\nf\u03c6 (Zi ) = din\n\n(13.6)\n\nFor \u03c6 = en one obtains a Frobenius like endomorphism of NSymm that descends to fn on\nSymm.\nIt is not clear what the composition properties of the f\u03c6 are. To figure that out, one needs\nto know the second comultiplication on QSymm in terms of the set of polynomial generators \u03a6 .\nIn particular it is not clear whether one can pick a polynomial basis such that there is a subfamily\nof associated Frobenius-like morphisms f\u02c6n which descend to the fn on Symm, satisfying\nf\u02c6n f\u02c6m = f\u02c6nm .\nAnother question one could ask is whether there are Hopf algebra endomorphisms f \u0303n that\ndescend to the fn on Symm and that are such that Vn f \u0303n = [n]NSymm , where [n]NSymm is defined as\nin (2.24) above. This is not quite the right question to ask because [n]NSymm is not a Hopf algebra\nendomorphism. However one can also convolve the canonical embedding CoF(Z) into NSymm\nwith itself n times by a formula very similar to (2.24) and the result will be a morphism of\ncoalgebras (because the comultiplication is cocommutative). Let the result be the [n]\u2032 . I.e. [1]\u2032\nis the imbedding just mentioned and, inductively\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n23\n\n\u03bc\n\nn\u2212 1 ]\u2032\nCoF( Z )\n[n]\u2032 = (CoF(Z) \uf8e7\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 CoF(Z) \u2297 CoF(Z) \uf8e7id\uf8e7\u2297[\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 NSymm \u2297 NSymm \uf8e7\uf8e7NSymm\n\uf8e7\u2192 NSymm)\nm\n\nThis [n]\u2032 defines a unique endomorphism of Hopf algebras of NSymm which will also be\ndenoted [n]\u2032 . Now the same question makes sense. The answer is still no (by some explicit\ncalculations). Over the rationals the desired endomorphisms do exist but they inevitably involve\nnoninteger coefficients.\n14. Noncommutative Witt vectors.\nConsider the (covariant representable) functor A a M(A) = Alg(QSymm, A) on the category of\ncommutative algebras over Z (i.e. rings). Because QSymm is a commutative algebra there is\nnothing to be gained in considering noncommutative A's. There are two (functorial) binary\noperations on M(A): first a noncommutative 'addition' making it a group valued functor, coming\nfrom the first comultiplication on QSymm (which has a counit and an antipode). The values are\ntherefore groups, usually noncommutative, because the first comultiplication on QSymm is\nhighly noncommmutative. There is also a 'multiplication', also noncommutative, coming from\nthe second comultiplication on QSymm. This one has a counit but no antipode. The\n'multiplication' is distributive over the noncommutative addition on the left but not on the right.\nThus the values of this functor are a somewhat unsual structure which has not been seen\noften before in mathematics. Actually I have never seen this kind of structure before.\nIn addition there are operators coming from the Frobenius morphisms of QSymm making it\na \u03c8 -(whatever the name of this kind of object could be). Finally there are an enormous amount\nof extra operators on it, all compatible with the noncommutative additive structure coming from\nthe Verschiebungs morphisms of QSymm.\nThis functor is a kind of noncommutative generalization of the Witt vectors. But a rather\nunexpected kind. Indeed, the inclusion Symm \u2282 QSymm induces functorial mappings\nM(A)\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 W(A) . These maps are all surjective because there are free polynomial bases of\nQSymm that include a free polynomial basis of Symm. Moreover, amoung the functorial\noperations on M(A) there are ones (many in fact) that descend to the Frobenius and\nVerschiebungs operations on the Witt vectors W(A) .\n\n15. The braided Hopf algebra of q-quasisymmetric functions.\nThere is one property of the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions that does assuredly not\ngeneralize to NSymm or QSymm. Viz its autoduality; i.e. the property that it is isomorphic to its\ndual. For indeed, NSymm is maximally noncommutative and cocommutative, while its graded\ndual QSymm is commutative and maximally noncocommutative.\nYet, I claim, they try very hard to be isomorphic all the same. A preposterous statement.\nLet's see.\nConsider the braided Hopf algebra qQSymm of quantum quasisymmetric functions. The\nunderlying Abelian group is\nqQSymm = \u2295 Z\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(15.1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 runs over all compositions. The same as for QSymm. The comultiplication is 'cut',\nalso the same as for QSymm. The multiplication is different. It is the quantum overlapping\nshuffle multiplication which can be recursively defined by\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n24\n\n[ ] \u00d7qosh \u03b1 = \u03b1, \u03b1 \u00d7qosh [ ] = \u03b1\n\u03b1 \u00d7 qosh \u03b2 = a1 \u2217 (\u03b1 \u2032 \u00d7 qosh \u03b2) + q b1wt( \u03b1 )b1 \u2217(\u03b1 \u00d7 qosh \u03b2 \u2032 )\n\n(15.2)\n\n+q b1wt( \u03b1 \u2032) (a1 + b1) \u2217(\u03b1 \u2032 \u00d7qosh \u03b2 \u2032 )\nwhere, as usual, the '\u2217' denotes concatenation, and\n\u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ], \u03b1 \u2032 = [a2 ,L,am ]\n\u03b2 = [b1,b2 ,L,bn ], \u03b2 \u2032 = [b2 ,L,bn ]\n\n(15.3)\n\nNote that for q = 1 one gets back the overlapping shuffle algebra, i.e. QSymm (which is\ncommutative), while, for q = 0 one gets the concatenation algebra (which is maximally\nnoncommutative). This makes this in any case a very interesting deformation of algebras.\nWith the comultiplication 'cut' and this multiplication qQSymm is a braided Hopf algebra.\nOne of the axioms of a Hopf algebra is that the multiplication is a morphism of coalgebras, or,\nequivalently, that the comultiplication is a morphism of algebras. In diagram terms this says that\nthe following diagram has to be commutative\nH\u2297 H\n\u2193m\nH\n\n\u03bc\u2297\u03bc\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 H \u2297 H \u2297 H \u2297 H\n\u2193 id \u2297 \u03c4 \u2297 id\nH \u2297H \u2297 H \u2297 H\n\u2193 m\u2297m\n\u03bc\n\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192\nH\u2297 H\n\n(15.4)\n\nIn the case of a (normal) Hopf algebra \u03c4 in the diagram above is the standard twist\n\u03c4: V \u2297 W \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 W \u2297 V, \u03c4(x \u2297 y) = y \u2297 x\n\n(15.5)\n\nA braiding is a systematic family of isomorphisms V \u2297 W \uf8e7\n\uf8e7~ \u2192 W \u2297 V (in the category\ninvolved) in some easily guessed technical sense. In the case at hand, the category is the one of\ngraded free Z-modules, and the braiding is given by\nx \u2297 y a qnm y \u2297 x\n\n(15.6)\n\nif x is homogeneous of weight m and y is homogeneous of weight n.\nA braided Hopf algebra is exactly like a Hopf algebra except that in the requirement (15.4)\nthe twist is replaced by the given braiding. Of course the twist itself is a perfectly good braiding.\n(One could, conceivably, even give up on the fact that the braiding consists of isomorphisms, but\nthat has not been studied to my knowledge.)\nThere is now a theorem, see [48] for the algebra part, that for generic q\nqQSymm dual . qQsymm. NSymm\n\n\fSymm, NSymm, and QSymm\n\n25\n\nas braided Hopf algebras for the first isomorphism; as algebras for the second (the braiding is\nthen not respected, nor the comultiplication, which is cocommutative for NSymm and\nmaximally noncocommutative for qQSymm). And actually an isomorphism can be written down\neasily. Exceptions are the roots of unity and many others. Little is known about the exceptional\nq. Thus we have a family of braided Hopf algebras parametrized by q which for generic q is\nselfdual but which for q = 1 yields QSymm with as dual NSymm.\nWhat this means, I do not know, but it is certainly a most interesting deformation family of\n(braided Hopf) algebras.\n\n16. Coda.\nThe present 'survey' is very much a report on ongoing investigations. As I have tried to indicate,\nthere are very many unanswered questions. Much of the above was without proofs. A full\nversion also including a lot of material that was not even alluded to above, and with proofs, is in\n(slow) preparation.\n\nReferences\n1.\nM F Atiyah, Power operations on K-theory, Quart. J.
