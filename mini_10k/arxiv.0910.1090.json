Due to their large production\nrate [1], jets are easily accessible by experiment and their\nlandmark discovery has, arguably, stimulated some of the\nmost important developments in the perturbation theory\nof strong interactions. At present, cross sections for processes involving jets are routinely calculated at next-toleading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order\nresults are also becoming available [2]. This remarkable\ntheoretical accuracy has made precision jet studies the\noptimal method for finding new physics beyond of the\nStandard Model at very high energies [3].\nAn unprecedented possibility exists today to extend\nthe theory of jets to energetic reactions with large nuclei\n(A+A) [4]. Experimental advances at this interface between particle and nuclear physics have already allowed\nproof-of-principle measurements of jets at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [5]. In this Letter we\npresent the first calculation of jet cross sections and jet\nsub-structure for Au+Au and Cu+Cu reactions at RHIC\nthat includes both NLO perturbative effects and effects\nof the nuclear medium. We demonstrate how jet observables can be used to gain insight into the mechanisms of\nparton interaction and energy loss [6] in hot, dense, and\nstrongly-interacting quark-gluon plasmas (QGPs) that\nare created in such reactions. We determine quantitatively the relation between the in-medium modification\nand broadening of parton showers in the QGP and the\nsuppression in the observed cross section as a function of\nthe jet cone radius R. Owing to their differential nature,\njet observables will soon place stringent constraints [5, 7]\non the approximations and theoretical model assumptions that underlay the current competing approaches to\nquark and gluon energy loss in hot and dense QCD matter. Such discriminating power cannot be achieved with\nmeasurements of leading particle quenching. This will, in\nturn, help eliminate the uncomfortably large systematic\n\nuncertainty in the extraction of the plasma properties,\nsuch as its density and transport coefficients [8].\nTo take full advantage of jet physics in reactions with\nultra-relativistic nuclei, calculations at O(\u03b13s ) are required [9]. In fact, the lowest order QGP-induced parton splitting is also manifested in experimental observ3\nWith the shortcut notation\nables at the same\nQ O(\u03b1s ).

For example,\nRsep = 2 yields a midpoint cone algorithm and Rsep = 1\ncorresponds to the kT algorithm [2, 10]. R is the cone\nsize or parton separation parameter, respectively.\nIn the top panel of Fig. 1 we show a comparison of\nthe NLO\u221acalculation [9] of the inclusive jet cross section at s = 200 GeV p+p collisions at RHIC to\nthe STAR experimental measurement which uses a midpoint cone algorithm [11] in the pseudorapidity range\n0.2 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 0.8. Very good agreement between data and\ntheory is achieved with a standard choice for the renormalization and factorization scales \u03bcR = \u03bcf = ET . Variation of these scales within (ET /2, 2ET ) leads to less than\n(+10%, \u221220%) variation of the jet cross section. The\nbottom panel of Fig. 1 illustrates the significant dependence of d\u03c3 jet /dydET on the cone size R, which, even in\np+p reactions, can exceed a factor of two. Analytically,\nthe ln(R/R0 ) scaling of the cross section can be understood from the 1/r angular behavior of the perturbative\nQCD splitting kernel. Further insight into the underlying parton dynamics can be gained by examining the jet\nsub-structure, often characterized by the differential jet\nshape:\n\n\u03c8(r, R) =\n\nd\ndr\n\n\u001b\n\u001aP\nE \u03b8(r \u2212 Ri,jet )\nP i Ti\n.\ni ETi \u03b8(R \u2212 Ri,jet )\n\n(3)\n\nIn Eq. (3) i stands for the sum over all particles in this\nRR\njet and 0 \u03c8(r, R)dr = 1. Analytically, jet shapes can be\n\n(4)\n\nIn Eq. (4) the first term represents the contribution from\nthe Sudakov-resummed small-angle parton splitting; the\nsecond and third terms give the leading-order finalstate and initial-state contributions, respectively; the\nlast two terms come from power corrections \u221d Q0 /ET ,\nQ0 \u2243 2 \u2212 3 GeV, when one integrates over the Landau\npole in the modified leading logarithmic approximation\n(MLLA). This approach was shown to provide a very\ngood description of the differential intra-jet energy flow\nat the Tevatron [4], as measured by CDF II [12]. Thus,\nreliable predictions for the jet sub-structure in p+p reactions at RHIC can be obtained and used as a baseline to study the distortion of jet shapes in more complex systems, such as p+A and A+A. An example of\n\u03c8 vac. (r, R = 0.4) for a quark jet of ET = 30 GeV is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nWhen compared to a parton shower in the vacuum, the\nmedium-induced quark and gluon splittings have noticeably different angular and lightcone momentum fraction\ndependencies [4, 13]. In particular, for energetic partons\npropagating in hot and dense QCD matter, the origin of\nthe coherent suppression of their radiative energy loss,\nknown as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, can\nbe traced to the cancellation of the collinear radiation at\nr < mD /h \u03c9(mD , \u03bbg ,p\nET ) i [13]. Here, the Debye screening scale mD = gT 1 + Nf /6 and h \u03c9 i \u2243 few GeV.\nThus, the medium-induced component of the jet, which\nis given by the properly normalized gluon bremsstrahlung\nintensity spectrum \u03c8 med (r, R) \u221d dI rad /d\u03c9dr within the\ncone, has a characteristic large-angle distribution away\nfrom the jet axis. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 for central Au+Au and central Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC. We\nemphasize that accurate numerical simulations, taking\n\nFIG. 2: The differential jet shape in vacuum \u03c8 vac. (r, R) is\ncontrasted to the medium-induced contribution \u03c8 med.

(5) defines a two dimensional jet attenuation pattern\nversus R and pmin\nfor every fixed ET . In contrast, for the\nT\nsame ET , inclusive particle quenching is represented by a\nsingle value related to the R \u2192 0 and pmin\n\u226b h \u03c9 i limit in\nT\nEq. (5). Thus, jet observables are much more differential\nand, hence, immensely more powerful than leading particles and leading particle correlations in their ability to\ndiscriminate between the competing physics mechanisms\nof quark and gluon energy loss in dense QCD matter and\nbetween theoretical model approximations to parton dynamics in the QGP.\nWe now focus on the first complete theoretical result\njet\nat NLO for RAA\nversus the jet cone size R for Au+Au\nand Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC. We use the reaction operator approach to non-Abelian energy loss [14], in the\nlimit of weak coupling between the jet and the plasma\nwith \u03b1s \u223c 0.3, to evaluate the probability distribution\nPq,g (\u01eb, E) that quarks and gluons,\nP respectively, will lose\na fraction of their energy \u01eb = i \u03c9i /E due to mediuminduced bremsstrahlung. Next, we determine the fraction\nof this energy that will be redistributed inside the jet:\nrad\nR R R ET\ndIq,g\ndr pmin d\u03c9 d\u03c9dr\n0\nmin\nT\n(6)\nfq,g \u2261 f (R, pT )q,g = R R\u221e R E\nrad .\ndIq,g\nT\ndr\nd\u03c9\nd\u03c9dr\n0\n0\n\nWhile such redistribution may affect the jet shape, it\nwill not affect the jet cross section. For example, when\nR \u2192 R\u221e and pmin\n\u2192 0 (fq,g = 1) final-state QGPT\ninduced effects to inclusive or tagged jet cross sections\nvanish. Parton interactions in the strongly-interacting\nplasma, however, are not the only many-body QCD effects that will alter the measured jet cross section. Cold\nnuclear matter (CNM) effects prior to the QGP formation [15] must also be included in accurate theoretical\ncalculations of hard probes production in nuclear colliCNM,NLO\nsions and we first evaluate d\u03c3d2 ET dy .

This is\nillustrated in the insert of Fig. 2. The most easily accessible experimental feature of jet production in nuclear collisions is, arguably, the suppression of the inclusive cross\nsection in heavy ion reaction compared to the binary collision scaled, \u221d hNbin i, production rate in elementary\nnucleon-nucleon reactions [4]:\n\nR=0.6/R=0.8\nR=0.4/R=0.8\nR=0.2/R=0.8\n\n1.25\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0.75\n\n30\nET [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0.50\nCentral Cu+Cu\n\n0.25\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nET [GeV]\n\nFIG. 3: Transverse energy dependent nuclear modification\njet\nfactor RAA\nfor different cone radii R in b = 3 fm \u221aAu+Au\n(top panel) and Cu+Cu (bottom panel) collisions at sNN =\n200 GeV.

Next, we determine the relative\nfractions nq,g of quark and gluon jets in this inclusive\ncross section (nq + ng = 1). These are well defined at\nleading order [16] and separation of the inclusive cross\nd\u03c3CNM,NLO\n\nsection into dq,g\nis necessary to properly describe\n2 E dy\nT\nparton energy loss in the QGP, which scales with the\nquadratic Casimir in the corresponding representation of\nSU(3) (CA /CF = 2.25). At NLO there exists an ambiguity of O(\u03b1s ) in this separation [16], which has a very\nsmall effect on inclusive jet observables.\nWe calculate the medium-modified jet cross section per\nbinary nucleon-nucleon scattering as follows (pmin\n= 0):\nT\n1 d\u03c3 AA (R)\n=\nhNbin i d2 ET dy\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u01eb=0\n\nd\u01eb\n\nX\n\nPq,g (\u01eb, E)\n\nq,g\n\nCNM,NLO\nd\u03c3q,g\n(R)\n1\n.

The fractional\nQGP-induced broadening \u2206h r/R i is also shown.\n\nET /(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 fq,g ) * \u01eb). Our results for the nuclear modifijet\ncation factor of inclusive jets RAA\nin central Au+Au and\n\u221a\nCu+Cu collisions with sN N = 200 GeV at RHIC are\npresented in Fig. 3. Each band illustrates a calculation\nfor a \u223c 20% increase in the rate of parton energy loss\n(lower bound) relative to our default simulation (upper\nbound). Experimental data on leading \u03c0 0 suppression for\nthese reactions is only included for reference. A continjet\nuous variation of RAA\nwith the cone radius R is clearly\nobserved in Fig. 3 and shows the sensitivity of the inclusive jet cross section in high-energy nuclear collisions to\nthe characteristics of QGP-induced parton shower. For\nR \u2264 0.2 the quenching of jets approximates the already\nobserved suppression in the production rate of inclusive\nhigh-pT particles. It should be noted that in our theoretical calculation CNM effects contribute close to 1/2 of\nthe observed attenuation for ET \u2265 30 GeV. These can be\ndrastically reduced at all ET by taking the ratio of two\ndifferential cross section measurements for different cone\nradii R1 and R2 . A few selected examples are shown in\nthe inserts of Fig. 3.\nInclusive jet cross sections and jet shapes in nuclear\ncollisions are closely related [4]:\n1\n\nX Pq,g (\u01eb, E) \u03c7q,g (R; ET , E \u2032 )\nT\n3\nR\n(1\n\u2212\n(1\n\u2212\nf\n)\n*\n\u01eb)\nq,g\n\u01eb=0\nq,g\n#\n\"\n\u0011\n\u0010r\n\u0011\n\u0010r\nq,g\nq,g\n, (8)\n; E \u2032 + fq,g * \u01eb \u03c8med.\n; E\u2032\n\u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u03c8vac.\nR\nR\n\n\u03c8tot.\n\n\u0010r\u0011\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb\n\n.

It\nT\nshould be noted that vacuum and medium-induced\nparton showers become more collimated with increasing ET\u2032 and the mean relative jet width hr/Ri =\nR1\nd(r/R)(r/R)\u03c8 (r/R) is reduced [4]. Consequently,\n0\nthe striking suppression pattern for jets, shown in\nFig. (3), can be accompanied by a very modest growth in\nthe observed hr/Ritot. . We show in Table I the relative\nwidths in the vacuum, for a hypothetical case of complete parton energy loss (Pq,g (\u01eb) = \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u01eb)) that falls\ninside of R (fq,g = 1), and for our realistic simulation\nof ET = 30 GeV jets of R = 0.4 in central Au+Au and\nCu+Cu collisions at RHIC. We find that, on average, jet\nbroadening \u2206hr/Ri = (hr/Ritot. \u2212 hr/Rivac. )/hr/Rivac.\nis < 5%. Larger effects are expected near the core r \u2192 0\n\nand the periphery r \u2192 R of the jet [4].\nIn summary, the principle goal of this Letter is to\nbring into focus the immense possibilities that jets offer as tomographic probes of the QGP created in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. To demonstrate the unprecedented sensitivity of jet observables to the characteristics of the vacuum and the medium-induced parton\nshowers, we presented first results for the related cross\nsections and shapes as a function of the cone radius R\nat next-to-leading order O(\u03b13s ) in p+p, central Au+Au,\nand central Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC. Our theoretical\npredictions include a most detailed account of cold and\nhot nuclear matter effects on jet production and distortion in heavy ion reactions and are of immediate relevance\nto upcoming PHENIX and STAR experimental measurements. We fully expect that this work will inspire future\nstudies of inclusive and tagged jets, jet sub-structure and\nevent shape observables. In their entirety, such studies\nwill provide first-principles insights into the many-body\nQCD parton dynamics at ultra-relativistic energies and\nshed light on the relative importance of collisional versus radiative energy loss and on the applicability of weak\nversus strong jet-medium coupling regimes.\nAcknowledgments: We thank D.
