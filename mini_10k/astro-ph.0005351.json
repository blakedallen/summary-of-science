The enhancement of s-process elements is interpreted\nas a result of mass transfer in a binary system from a previous AGB companion, an\ninterpretation strongly supported by radial velocity variations of this system.\nThe detection of Pb makes it possible, for the first time, to compare model predictions of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars with observations of elements between\nSr and Pb. The Pb abundance is significantly lower than the prediction of recent\nmodels (e.g., Gallino et al. 1998), which succeeded in explaining the metallicity dependence of the abundance ratios of light s-elements (Sr-Zr) to heavy ones (Ba-Dy)\nfound in previously observed s-process-enhanced stars.

One important\ncomponent in understanding s-process nucleosynthesis is the correct identification of the neutron\nsources involved. Two reactions \u2013 22 Ne(\u03b1, n)25 Mg and 13 C(\u03b1, n)16 O \u2013 have received most attention.\nRecent models of AGB stars prefer 13 C as the main source, because the temperature of the He\nburning shell hardly reaches 3 \u00d7 108 K required for the 22 Ne(\u03b1, n)25 Mg reaction (e.g., Gallino et\nal. 1998). This is supported by the observed metallicity dependence of the abundance ratios of\nheavier s-process elements (e.g., Ba, Nd) to lighter ones (e.g., Sr, Zr) found in s-process-enhanced\nobjects such as MS- and S-type stars (Smith & Lambert 1990), barium stars (Luck & Bond 1991)\nand CH stars (Vanture 1992; Norris et al. 1997a). While the seed nuclei for the s-process, such\nas iron, are secondary (i.e., their abundances are proportional to metallicity), the production of\n13 C in AGB stars is primary, contrary to that of 22 Ne. Therefore, higher neutron exposure, and\nthus larger enhancement of the heavier elements, is expected from 13 C in stars of lower metallicity.\nModels of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars by Gallino et al. (1998), followed by Busso et al. (1999),\nsuccessfully reproduced the observed trend for lighter elements (Sr-Zr), as well as for heavier ones\n(Ba-Gd).\nFor stars of very low metallicity, according to these models, a large excess of lead (Pb) is\nexpected. For instance, the enhancement of Pb by two or three orders of magnitude relative to\nthat expected for solar-abundance stars is predicted for AGB stars with [Fe/H] = \u22122.0 5 , while that\nof Ba is at most one order of magnitude (Busso et al. 1999). Thus Pb in metal-poor, s-processenhanced, stars should provide an excellent diagnostic for models of s-process nucleosynthesis in\nAGB stars.\nHowever, the abundance of Pb is difficult to measure in most stars.\nLead abundances for the metal-poor stars HD 115444 and HD 126238 were derived from Hubble\nSpace Telescope ultraviolet spectra (Sneden et al. 1998), but Pb has not yet been detected in the\noptical spectra of these objects. The Sneden et al. (2000) analysis of a high-S/N Keck HIRES\nspectrum of the r-process-rich star CS 22892-052 detected Pb I lines in the visual spectrum of\nthis star, and derived its abundance. We note that the Pb observed in all three of these stars is\nattributed primarily to the r-, rather than the s-process, due to the strong enhancements of other\nr-process-dominated nuclei, such as Eu. One study of the s-process for a solar metallicity star\nby Gonzalez et al. (1998) reports the Pb abundance of the post-AGB star FG-Sge, based on an\nanalysis of the Pb I 7229\u00c5 line.\nIn this Letter we report the detection of Pb I 4057.8\u00c5 and derive a Pb abundance in the carbonrich, very metal-poor star LP 625-44. This object was shown by Norris et al. (1997a) to exhibit very\nlarge excesses of carbon, nitrogen, and neutron-capture elements. Their interpretation was that the\nlarge excesses of heavy elements were likely to have originated from s-process nucleosynthesis in\nan AGB binary companion which provided LP 625-44 with carbon-rich material by mass transfer.\n5\n\n[A/B]\u2261 log(NA /NB ) \u2212 log(NA /NB )\u2299 , and log \u01ebA \u2261 log(NA /NH ) + 12 for elements A and B\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe updated abundance pattern (see \u00a73), and variation of radial velocity (see \u00a72), reported in the\npresent work make this interpretation quite convincing. The determination of a Pb abundance for\nthis star (\u00a73) provides the opportunity, for the first time, to test models of nucleosynthesis in AGB\nstars for s-process elements between Sr and Pb (\u00a74).\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Measurements\n\nA high-resolution spectrum of LP 625-44 was obtained with the University College London\ncoud\u00e9 \u00e9chelle spectrograph (UCLES) and Tektronix 1024\u00d71024 CCD at the Anglo-Australian Telescope on August 5, 1996. The wavelength range 3700\u20134720 \u00c5 was covered with resolving power\nR \u223c 40, 000. We also obtained a red spectrum (5015\u20138500 \u00c5) with the same instrument on June\n16, 1994. The numbers of detected photons are 12000 per 0.04\u00c5 pixel at 4300\u00c5 (S/N \u223c 150 per\nresolution element) and 2000 per 0.06\u00c5 pixel at 6000\u00c5 (S/N \u223c 60 per resolution element).\nData reduction was performed in the standard way within the IRAF6 environment. Equivalent\nwidths were measured by fitting Gaussian profiles to the absorption lines, and will be reported in\nAoki et al. (2000). The error for lines weaker than 60 m\u00c5, determined from the comparison of\ntwo measurements of lines which appear on adjacent \u00e9chelle orders, was about 4 m\u00c5 and 6 m\u00c5\nin the blue and red spectra, respectively. There is no systematic difference between the equivalent\nwidths of Fe I lines measured in this work and those by Norris et al. (1996), even though our S/N\nis substantially higher.\nAdditional spectra were obtained on 1998 August 11 and 2000 January 26, the former using\nUCLES, and the latter with the Utrecht \u00e9chelle spectrograph (UES) on the William Herschel\nTelescope (WHT). Both have lower S/N than is necessary for an abundance analysis, the sole aim\nbeing to measure radial velocities. In each case, HD 140283 was also observed to provide a template\nfor cross-correlation. That star has a similar metallicity but is free of the CH blends that affect\nmany lines in LP 625-44. Radial velocities for LP 625-44 were obtained relative to HD 140283 by\ncross-correlation, and by measuring the radial velocity of HD 140283 from the central wavelengths of\n175 (1998) and 122 (2000) unblended lines. Error estimates were based on the variation in velocity\nfrom different \u00e9chelle orders and from the standard error in the measurement of HD 140283. The\nheliocentric values, which extend those presented by Norris et al. (1997a), are: HJD 2451037.00:\nvrad = 33.5 \u00b1 0.2 (1\u03c3) km s\u22121 ; and HJD 2451569.80: vrad = 30.0 \u00b1 0.3 (1\u03c3) km s\u22121 . Ryan et al.\n(1999) estimated external errors of 0.3 km s\u22121 for a similar procedure; this has been added to the\ninternal errors for Fig. 1. The data confirm that LP 625-44 is a binary with a period of at least 12\nyears.\n6\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n\nAbundance Analysis and Results\n\nIn the region near the Pb I line at 4058\u00c5 , line-blending is so severe that the Pb abundance\nwas derived by spectrum synthesis. This method was also applied to lines which are affected by\nblending and/or hyperfine splitting. The standard analysis, based on the equivalent widths, was\napplied to single (unblended) lines.\nThe abundance analysis used model atmospheres in the ATLAS9 grid of Kurucz (1993a).\nWe adopted an effective temperature Teff = 5500K, determined by Norris et al. (1997a) from\nthe R \u2212 I color. This color is not severely affected by strong carbon and nitrogen features in\nstars of this temperature and abundance (Aoki et al. 2000). Surface gravity (log g), metallicity,\nand microturbulent velocity (\u03be), were re-determined in the present work. The surface gravity was\nobtained from the ionization balance between Fe I and Fe II, the metallicity was estimated from\nthe abundance analysis of those lines, and \u03be was determined from the Fe I lines by demanding no\ndependence of the derived abundance on equivalent widths. The results are: log g = 2.8, \u03be = 1.6\nkm s\u22121 , and [Fe/H] = \u22122.72. The agreement with the results of Norris et al. (1997a) is good,\nwith the exception of the microturbulent velocity, for which they derived 1.0 km s\u22121 .\nPb lines are difficult to measure in optical stellar spectra. Even for the sun, only four Pb I\nlines (3639 \u00c5 , 3683 \u00c5 , 3739 \u00c5 , and 4057 \u00c5) have been studied in the visual region. From these,\nYoussef & Khalil (1989) determined the abundance log \u01ebPb = 2.0, which agrees fairly well with\nmeteoritic measurements (log \u01ebPb = 2.06; Grevesse et al. 1996).\nOur spectra covered the lines at 3739.9\u00c5 and 4057.8\u00c5 , listed in Table 1. They are expected to\nbe weak, and no clear absorption appears in the solar spectrum. However, Pb I 4057.8\u00c5 was clearly\ndetected in LP 625-44, as shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2, where the synthetic spectra fitted to\nthe observed data are also shown. In spite of the presence of other lines, the contribution of Pb I\nis remarkable. To check possible contamination of the Pb region by other elements, we examined\nthe spectrum of HD 140283, a very metal-poor subgiant (Teff = 5750 K, log g = 3.4 and [Fe/H]\n= \u22122.54, Ryan et al. 1996). We found no distinct absorption feature at 4057.8\u00c5 (see Fig. 1b in\nNorris et al. 1996). As a further check for contamination due to CH and CN, the observed and\nsynthetic spectra of CS 22957-027 are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2. Norris et al. (1997b)\nshowed that this very metal-poor giant (Teff = 4850K, log g = 1.9 and [Fe/H] = \u22123.38) has very\nlarge excesses of 12 C, 13 C and N but no excess of heavy elements. This spectrum indicates that the\nabsorption feature at 4057.8\u00c5 in LP 625-44 is not due to CH and CN lines.\nTo check our procedure for the determination of the Pb abundance, we also analyzed the solar\nspectrum (Kurucz 1993b) using a solar photospheric model (Holweger & M\u00fcller 1974). Our result\nagrees very well with that of Youssef & Khalil (1989) for Pb I 3683\u00c5, which is the clearest Pb I line\nin the optical range. This demonstrates the reliability of the basic data (e.g., partition functions)\nand the software used in our analysis. (Line contamination is so severe at 4057.8\u00c5 in the solar\nspectrum that the exact abundance cannot be derived from this line.)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nAn abundance ratio [Pb/Fe] = 2.65 was derived for LP 625-44 from a comparison between\nthe synthetic spectra and the observed one. The other Pb I line covered by our spectrum is at\n3739.9\u00c5, but there is no distinct feature at this wavelength. Hence, we derive an upper limit on\nthe abundance ratio [Pb/Fe] < +3.2 from this non-detection, which supports the Pb I 4057.8\u00c5\nresult ([Pb/Fe]=2.65). This upper limit is important, as in the next section we show that this Pb\nabundance is lower than predicted by some models of s-process nucleosynthesis in very metal-poor\nAGB stars.\nOur derived abundances for the heavy elements are similar to the results presented by Norris\net al. (1997a). Abundances of Er, Tm and Hf, not previously known in this star, could also be\ndetermined due to the better quality of the new spectra. All new results are given in Table 2. The\nline data used in the analysis will be compiled in Aoki et al. (2000).\nErrors in our estimated abundances were obtained as follows. Errors arising from uncertainties\nin the atmospheric parameters were evaluated by adding in quadrature the individual errors on the\nparameters \u2013 \u2206Teff = 100K, \u2206 log g = 0.3, and \u2206\u03be = 0.5km s\u22121 . The internal errors were estimated\nby assuming the random error in the equivalent width measurements to be 4 m\u00c5 (and 6 m\u00c5 for\nBa II in the red region; see \u00a72), and taking the random error in less-certain gf values to be 0.1 dex.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion and Concluding Remarks\n\nFig. 3 presents derived abundances as a function of atomic species for LP 625-44. The thick\nsolid line indicates the abundance pattern of the main s-process component determined by Arlandini\net al. (1999), while the thin line indicates the r-process component. The dotted line is the total\nsolar abundance adopted by Arlandini et al. (1999). We see good agreement between the observed\nabundances of elements heavier than Ba with the scaled s-process component. This fact, found\nby Norris et al. (1997a) for Ba to Dy, is now extended to heavier elements and made even more\ncompelling. The excesses of these elements, and their s-process nature, are interpreted as a result\nof the transfer of material rich in s-process elements across a binary system including an AGB star.\nOur new radial velocity measurements confirm the binarity and strengthen this interpretation.\nSince the excess of heavy elements is very large (e.g., [Ba/Fe]=2.7), the material from the AGB\nstar should dominate the surface abundances of LP 625-44. Thus, the relative abundances of the\nheavy elements in this star should provide an almost pure representation of the nucleosynthesis\nproducts of the previously existing very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = \u22122.7) AGB companion.\nWith the adoption of this interpretation the abundances in LP 625-44 can be compared with\ntheoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars. Gallino et al. (1998) and Busso et\nal. (1999) showed that, at low abundance, the metallicity effect on s-process yields favors the\nproduction of heavier elements. As found in Fig. 3, the Sr-Zr enhancement relative to the solar scomponent is much smaller than that of heavy elements (Ba-Hf) in LP 625-44, a result in qualitative\nagreement with the expected metallicity dependence.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nThe metallicity effect is essentially due to the level of neutron exposure, which is expected\nto be higher at lower metallicity (see \u00a71). Higher neutron exposure necessarily requires larger\nproduction of the heaviest s-process element, Pb, in very metal-poor stars. Busso et al. (1999)\nexplicitly showed the metallicity effect on the enhancement factors of s-process elements relative\nto solar abundances for \u22123.2 < [Fe/H] < 0.4 in their Figure 12, where the enhancement factor of\nPb is larger by about two orders of magnitude than that of Ba at [Fe/H] = \u22122.7. However, the\nenhancement of Pb in LP 625-44 ([Pb/Fe] = 2.65) is nearly the same as that of Ba ([Ba/Fe] = 2.74).\nIf the observed Pb abundance of LP 625-44 generally represents the yields from very metal-poor\nAGB stars, their models of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars may overestimate its production by about\ntwo orders of magnitude at very low metallicity.\nThis conflict might be resolved by tuning the models of Gallino et al. (1998) or Busso et\nal. (1999). For instance, the neutron flux can be changed by modifying the extension or chemical\nprofile of the 13 C-pocket, which is a free parameter in their models. Another parameter is the\nmass of the AGB star, upon which the number of thermal pulses (and hence episodes of neutron\nexposure) is strongly dependent.\nAnother possibility is that the s-process production mechanism in very metal-poor (e.g.,\n[Fe/H]< \u22122.5) AGB stars is quite different from that in more metal-rich stars. The calculation of\nlow-mass stellar evolution in metal-deficient stars by Fujimoto et al. (2000) showed that hydrogen\nmixing occurs during the helium shell flash for 1\u22123.5 M\u2299 stars with [Fe/H]< \u22122.5 (their case II'),\ncontrary to the situation for stars with higher metallicity (their case IV). Their result suggests\nthat the production of 13 C, and subsequent s-process nucleosynthesis, is possible in the helium\nconvective region during thermal pulses in these very metal-poor stars.\nOur detection of Pb in the very metal-poor, carbon- and s-process-rich star, LP 625-44 provides\na strong constraint on models of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars. The observed abundance patterns\nfor heavier elements (Ba-Pb) agree well with the solar main s-process component, rather than\nwith nucleosynthesis models for very metal-poor AGB stars. Further observation of s-process\nelements, including Pb, for objects similar to LP 625-44, and revisions of the theoretical approach\nto the nucleosynthesis in very metal-poor environments, will impact on our understanding of the\nevolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars, as well as of the enrichment of heavy elements in\nthe early Galaxy. In this context, we note that we have also measured Pb in the star LP 706-7,\nwhich is similar to LP 625-44 in many respects (Norris et al. 1997a). That object, whose s-process\nabundances nevertheless differ from those of LP 625-44, will be discussed separately in a future\npaper.\nWe are grateful to the Director and staff of the Anglo-Australian Observatory, and the Australian Time Allocation Committee for providing the observational facilities used in this study.\nW.A. would like to acknowledge fruitful discussions with T.
