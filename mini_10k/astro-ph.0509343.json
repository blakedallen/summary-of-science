A\nquantitative analysis of the UV, optical, near- and mid-IR spectrum of HD 164270\nis presented, allowing for line blanketing and wind clumping, revealing T\u2217 \u223c48kK,\nlog L/L\u2299 \u223c 4.9, \u1e40 \u223c 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for a volume filling factor of f \u223c0.1. Our models\npredict that He is partially recombined in the outer stellar wind, such that recent\nradio-derived mass-loss rates of WC9 stars have been underestimated. We obtain\nC/He\u223c0.2 and O/He\u223c0.01 by number from optical diagnostics. Mid-IR fine structure\nlines of [Ne ii] 12.8 \u03bcm and [S iii] 18.7\u03bcm are observed, with [Ne iii] 15.5\u03bcm and [S iv]\n10.5\u03bcm absent. From these we obtain Ne/He \u223c Ne+ /He = 2.2\u00d710\u22123 by number, 7\ntimes higher than the Solar value (as recently derived by Asplund et al.), and S/He\n\u223cS2+ /He = 5.1\u00d710\u22125 by number. From a comparison with similar results for other\nWC subtypes we conclude that WC9 stars are as chemically advanced as earlier subtypes. We consider why late WC stars are exclusively observed in high metallicity\nenvironments. In addition, we compare the UV/optical/mid-IR spectroscopic morphology of HD 164270 with the Planetary Nebula central star BD+30 3639 ([WC9]).\nTheir UV and optical signatures are remarkably similar, such that our quantitative\ncomparisons confirm similarities in stellar temperature, wind densities and chemistry\nfirst proposed by Smith & Aller, in spite of completely different evolutionary histories,\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nwith HD 164270 presently a factor of ten more massive than BD+30 3639. At midIR wavelengths, the dust from the dense young, nebula of BD+30 3639 completely\ndominates its appearance, in contrast with HD 164270.\nSubject headings: stars: individual: HD 164270, BD+30 3639 \u2013 stars: Wolf-Rayet \u2013\ninfrared: stars \u2013 planetary nebulae: general\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has long been known that low ionization, carbon sequence Wolf-Rayet stars (WC9\nstars) are exclusively found within the inner, metal-rich disk of our Milky Way (van der\nHucht 2001; Hopewell et al. 2005). No WC9 stars are known elsewhere in the Local Group\nof galaxies, despite numerous surveys (Heydari-Malayeri et al. 1990, Moffat 1991). Indeed,\nWC9 populations have only recently been identified elsewhere within the metal-rich spiral\nM 83 by Hadfield et al. (2005).\nThe link between late WC subtypes and metal-rich environments led Smith & Maeder\n(1991) to suggest that strong stellar winds at high metallicity reveal He-burning processed\nmaterial at an earlier phase than at lower metallicity, which they attributed spectroscopically\nto late WC stars, i.e. a decreasing C/He abundance ratio at later WC subtypes. This\nhas persisted in the literature through to the present time (e.g. Hirschi et al. 2005). In\ncontrast, stellar atmosphere models of WC4\u20138 stars have concluded that there is no such\ntrend with subtype (Koesterke & Hamann 1995). Alternatively, neglecting optical depth\neffects, recombination line theory may be applied to hydrogenic transitions of C iv in early\nWC stars (e.g. Smith & Hummer 1998). Since C ii-iii transitions dominate the optical\nappearance of late WC stars, recombination line studies of late WC stars are extremely\nchallenging.\nThe advent of sensitive mid-IR spectrometers aboard Infrared Space Observatory and\nSpitzer allows alternative indicators of evolutionary status, via fine-structure lines from elements sensitive to advanced nucleosynthesis reactions, such as neon. Theoretically, at the\nstart of He-burning one expects the rapid conversion of 14 N to 22 Ne, increasing the abundance of this isotope by a factor of \u223c100. Together with the cosmically more abundant\n20\nNe isotope, one would expect a factor of \u223c15 increase in the neon abundance. Following\ntechniques pioneered by Barlow et al. (1988), Ne/He in WC stars may be determined from\nmeasuring fluxes of the [Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm and [Ne iii] 15.5\u03bcm lines, the latter solely observed\nfrom space-based missions. Mid-IR studies with ISO have revealed high Ne abundances in\nWC6\u20138 stars (Willis et al. 1997; Dessart et al. 2000). The majority of late-type WC stars\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nare known to form carbon-rich dust, either persistent or episodically such that many are\ndust-dominated at mid-IR wavelengths (Williams et al. 1987). Due to poor sensitivity of\nthe mid-IR SWS spectrometer, only dust dominated WC9 stars were observed with ISO,\ncompletely veiling the stellar wind signature in the mid-IR. To date, AS320 (WR121) is the\nonly WC9 star for which a neon abundance has been obtained, albeit based solely on [Ne ii]\n12.8\u03bcm (Smith & Houck 2005).\nIn the current study, Spitzer IRS spectroscopy of HD 164270 (WR103, WC9) is presented. HD 164270 does possess a dust shell (van der Hucht 2001), although this is sufficiently\nfaint that stellar wind lines are observed in the mid-IR, including the crucial fine-structure\nlines of Ne and S. In order to derive neon and sulfur abundances, we perform the first quantitative study of a WC9 star allowing for non-LTE radiative transfer in an extended, clumped,\nexpanding atmosphere allowing for metal line blanketing (Hillier & Miller 1998).\nFinally, we carry out the first modern comparison between the chemical and wind properties of HD 164270 and BD+30 3639 ([WC9], alias HD 184738, Campbell 1893). The latter\nrepresents one of a small group of central stars of Planetary Nebulae (CSPNe) which share\nthe spectroscopic appearance of WC stars. Smith & Aller (1971) carried out an optical\nqualitative spectroscopic comparison of these two stars and concluded that they were virtually identical, except for narrower wind lines and strong nebular lines in the CSPN. BD+30\n3639 is located in a young (800 yr) compact nebula (4\u2032\u2032 in diameter, Li et al. 2002) whilst\nHD 164270, as with most Population I WC stars, is not associated with an optically visible\nnebula. As with some dusty WC stars, PNe with late-[WC] type central stars are very bright\nat mid-IR wavelengths due to hot dust within their compact, dense nebulae, so were readily\nobserved with ISO/SWS (e.g. Waters et al 1998). In general, the material around massive\nWolf-Rayet stars known to have circumstellar nebulae may contain dust condensed in one\nor more slow-moving outflows from previous mass-loss episodes, or by interactions with the\nISM.\nAlthough both WC and [WC] stars involve hydrogen deficient stars at a late stage of\nevolution, their evolutionary paths followed are remarkably different. WC stars represent\nthe final phase of initially very massive stars (\u2265 25M\u2299 at Solar metallicity) undergoing\nadvanced stages of nucleosynthesis prior to core-collapse as a Supernova. WC stars, with\nages of \u223c5Myr, thus represent the bare cores of massive stars due to extensive stellar winds\nand exhibit the products of core He-burning (Meynet & Maeder 2003). In contrast, it is\nthought that [WC] stars result from low initial mass (\u223c 2M\u2299 ) progenitors following the\nAsymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. The hydrogen-rich stellar envelope of AGB stars\nmay be removed in a late thermal pulse following shell H and He burning (Iben et al. 1983;\nHerwig et al. 1999), resulting in H-deficient post-AGB stars, CSPNe and ultimately white\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndwarfs.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nOur study uses far-UV to mid-IR spectroscopy of HD 164270 and BD+30 3639, of which\nSpitzer IRS mid-IR spectroscopy of HD 164270 is newly presented here.\n\n2.1.\n\nMid-IR/near-IR spectroscopy\n\nHD 164270 was observed on 2004 March 4 (AOR key 6012160), with the Spitzer-IRS\n(Houck et al. 2004) as part of the Guaranteed Time Program WRDUST, using the long-slit\nShort-Low (SL) module at a spectral resolution R \u2261 \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u2243 75 \u2212 125, and the Short-High\n(SH) and Long-High (LH) echelle modules each at R \u2243 1000. These cover the wavelength\nranges of 5.3 \u2212 14.5 \u03bcm (SL), 10\u201319.5 \u03bcm (SH), and 19\u201337.5 \u03bcm (LH). Once the telescope's\npointing was re-initalized to an accuracy of \u2264 1\u2032\u2032 .0 (1 \u03c3 radial) using high accuracy peakup\non a nearby offset star with the 16 \u03bcm camera in the IRS, the spectral observations were\ncarried out in Staring Mode, which points the telescope so that the star is observed at two\nseparate positions along the length of each slit, in principle allowing one to make background\n(zodiacal light and cirrus) emission corrections and mitigating the residual effects of incident\ncosmic rays and solar particles. The spectra were obtained using total integration times of\n84, 480, and 360 seconds in the SL, SH, and LH modules, respectively. Background and pixel\ncorrections in the nodded observations works in practice only for the SL observations, but\ncannot be achieved with the relatively short SH and LH slits without dedicated off-source\nobservations, which we did not acquire. Background corrections to the SH and LH portions\nwere therefore applied using the background model available from the Spitzer Science Center1 , normalized to the background levels observed with the SL portion at 10\u03bcm. Corrections\nto outlier pixels are discussed below.\nRaw data cubes were processed on a pixel basis in the SSC pipeline (S10.5), which reformats the pixel data and housekeeping information, removes dark currents and multiplexer\ndrift, applies corrections for inter-pixel photocurrent coupling and amplifier non-linearities,\nfits the integration ramps and reduces the data cubes to 2-dimensional signal planes in units\nof electrons/sec/pixel. At this point we removed the background levels in the SL data,\ndefined approximately 1\u2032 on either side of the star in the off-source subslits. The result1\n\nhttp://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/documents/background/\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ning illumination profile at each wavelength was found to be consistent with that of a point\nsource (no extended emission was detected), and subsequent photometric point-source calibrations were applied during spectral extraction. Prior to extraction of the SH and LH\ndata, however, we made systematic outlier pixel corrections using preceding dark current\nmeasurements obtained on the \"blank\" sky at the North Ecliptic Pole. The default superdarks subtracted in this version of the pipeline are combined from measurements over several\nobserving campaigns, but the offline use of nearest-in-time dark currents provides a more\naccurate, contemporaneous match to individual pixels with dark currents varying over several hours to a day. Remaining dead pixels in the illuminated regions of the arrays (totaling\nless than 5%) were corrected by a spline interpolation scheme. Spectra from each individual\nintegration were then extracted using offline SSC software, applying wavelength calibrations\naccurate to \u223c1/5 resolution element for well-pointed observations (\u00b1 0.02 and 0.002 \u03bcm in\nSL and SH spectra at 10\u03bcm, and \u00b1 0.005 \u03bcm in LH at 25 \u03bcm). Individual spectra were then\nexamined and combined. Photometric uncertainties are estimated to be 5% for SL, 5 \u2013 15%\nfor SH, and 15 \u2013 20% for LH (increasing with wavelength due to the approximations of the\nbackground levels). However, we find excellent agreement between our flux-calibrated IRS\nspectra and ground-based L, M and N-band photometry, discussed below.\nThe IRS spectrum of HD 164270 is described by a blue stellar continuum, with a number\nof spectral features superimposed. We present selected regions of the IRS spectrum in Fig. 1,\nrevealing a combination of spectral lines from He i and C ii formed in the inner stellar wind,\nplus fine-structure lines from [Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm and [S iii] 18.7\u03bcm formed in the outer stellar\nwind, with [Ne iii] 15.5\u03bcm and [S iv] 10.5\u03bcm notably absent. We have measured the line\nfluxes from the fine-structure lines to be F\u03bb ([Ne II]) = 2.18 \u00b10.08 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg/s/cm2 , and\nF\u03bb ([S III]) = 1.03 \u00b10.01 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg/s/cm2 .\nFor BD+30 3639 we use the combined ISO SWS/LWS spectrum from Cohen et al.\n(2002), namely TDT35501531 (SWS01) and TDT35501412 (LWS01) observed in Nov 1996,\nto which the reader is referred for detailed information. The mid-IR continuum is reproduced\nby two temperature blackbodies (290 and 98K) plus crystalline and amorphous silicate features (Waters et al. 1998). No stellar spectral features are observed due to the dominant\ndust signature. [Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm and [S iii] 18.7\u03bcm are also observed in BD+30 3639, although\nthese are nebular in origin within this system. The neutral nebular mass amounts to 0.13M\u2299\nfor a distance of 1.2 kpc as derived from the ISO/LWS [C ii] 158\u03bcm line flux (Liu et al. 2001).\nWe have also used near-IR spectroscopy of HD 164270 obtained with the 3.8m UK\nInfrared Telescope (UKIRT) from August 1994. The cooled grating spectrograph CGS4,\n300mm camera, 75l/mm grating and a 62\u00d758 InSb array were used to observe three nonoverlapping settings, covering 1.03-1.13\u03bcm (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb = 800), 1.61-1.82\u03bcm (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb = 600) and\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.01\u20132.21\u03bcm (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb = 800. Details of the data reduction are provided by Crowther & Smith\n(1996). Eenens & Williams (1994) derive a wind velocity of 1100 km/s using their higher\nspectral resolution He i 2.058\u03bcm observations of HD 164270.\n\n2.2.\n\nUV/optical spectroscopy\n\nFlux calibrated optical spectroscopy of HD 164270 were obtained with the 3.9m Anglo\nAustralian Telescope and RGO spectrograph in November 1992 with a 1024x1024 Tektronix\nCCD, 1200V grating and 250mm camera, providing complete coverage between \u03bb\u03bb3680\u2013\n6000 in three overlapping settings at 1.7\u00c5 resolution. For BD+30 3639, flux calibrated\nspectroscopy was obtained at the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope, together with the dualbeam ISIS spectrograph in August 2002. ISIS was equipped with an EEV CCD and 300B\ngrating (blue) and a Marconi CDD and 300R grating (red) plus the \u03bb6100 dichroic, providing\ncomplete spectral coverage between \u03bb\u03bb3400\u20138800 at 3.5\u00c5 resolution. A standard reduction\nwas applied in both cases using calibration arc lamps and spectrophotometric standard stars\n(e.g. see Crowther et al. 1998 for further details). Modern optical spectroscopy supports\nthe findings of Smith & Aller (1971), with selected (classification) spectral regions presented\nin Fig. 2.\nUV high dispersion, large aperture spectroscopy of both targets was obtained from\nthe IUE Newly Extracted Spectra (INES) archive, namely SWP8156 and LWP13972 for\nHD 164270, with SWP7594, 7642, 8591, 8863, 13333, 51870 and LWR6924, 7334 for HD 164270.\nStellar wind velocities (vblack ) have been measured for Si iv \u03bb1394, revealing 1140\u00b150 km/s\nfor HD 164270 (Prinja et al. 1990) and 700\u00b150 km/s for BD+30 3639. These values are\nadopted for the remainder of this analysis.\nFinally, we also used Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectroscopy of\nHD 164270 covering \u03bb\u03bb912\u20131190\u00c5, namely F USE dataset P1171001 with an exposure time\nof 5.1ks, as discussed in Willis et al. (2004). Our adopted wind velocity of HD 164270 is\nreasonable agreement with the average velocity of 1036 km/s in Willis et al.\n\n2.3.\n\nDistances and interstellar reddening\n\nWe adopt spectrophotometry of HD 164270 from Torres-Dodgen & Massey (1988),\nrevealing a narrow-band (Smith 1968) visual magnitude of v=8.86 mag, whilst we adopt\nMv = \u22124.6 \u00b1 0.4 mag for WC9 subtypes, based on estimated absolute magnitudes for three\nGalactic WC9 stars from van der Hucht (2001). High resolution spectroscopy of several WC9\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nstars reveals the characteristic signature of a luminous OB-type companion (Williams & van\nder Hucht 2000), but no evidence of a luminous companion to HD 164270 is known (Smith\n& Aller 1971). From our spectral fits we estimate E(b \u2212 v)=0.49 (E(B \u2212 V )=0.58) using\nR=AV /E(B \u2212 V )=3.0 which indicates a distance of \u223c1.9 kpc to HD 164270.\nFor BD+30 3639, our WHT spectrophotometry indicates v =10.28 mag. Li et al. (2002)\nhave recently analysed WFPC2 images obtained 5 yr apart to measure the PN expansion\nrate and so derive a distance of 1.2 kpc which together with our estimate of E(b \u2212 v)=0.32\n(E(B \u2212 V ) =0.39) indicates Mv = \u22121.5 mag.\n2.4.\n\nDust modeling\n\nDe-reddened spectrophotometric flux distributions from 0.1 to 100\u03bcm are presented\nin Fig. 3, together with ground-based photometry from 2MASS, Williams et al. (1987)\nand Jameson et al. (1974), and theoretical continua obtained from our analysis. These\nillustrate the UV/optical similarities, and mid-IR differences between HD 164270 and BD+30\n3639. Dust contributes negligibly to the total energy budget of HD 164270, whilst the (reradiated) dust in BD+30 3639 is comparable to the stellar flux. We adopt a standard\nGalactic extinction law (R=3.1) for the UV/optical/near-IR (Howarth 1983), supplemented\nwith a mid-IR extinction curve provided by M. Cohen (see Fig.2 of Morris et al. 2000).\nSince the primary goal of the current study is to investigate the physical and wind\nproperties of WC9 stars, we use dust radiative transfer models from the recent literature.\nFor HD 164270, we use a dust spectral energy distribution from TORUS (Harries, priv\ncomm.) following the approach of Harries et al. (2004) for WR104. The TORUS model\nassumes a spherical shell composed of amorphous carbon with a uniform size of 0.1\u03bcm and a\ndust-to-gas ratio of 2\u00d710\u22125 by mass. With respect to other very dusty WC9 stars (van der\nHucht et al. 1996), the dust shell associated with HD 164270 is relatively weak, contributing\nat most 80% of the continuum flux at 3\u03bcm.\nFor the dust associated with BD+30 3639 we use the MODUST model presented by\nWaters et al. (1998), who identified distinct (cooler) O-rich and (warmer) C-rich shells. The\nMODUST model is successful in reproducing the observed energy distribution longward of\n10\u03bc, where dust contributes greater than 99.9% of the continuum flux, but fails to reproduce\nthe 1\u201310\u03bcm excess. For both HD 164270 and BD+30 3639, dust emission contaminates the\nstellar flux distribution longward of 1.3\u03bcm.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.\n\nQuantitative analysis\n3.1.\n\nTechnique\n\nFor the present study we employ CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998), which solves the\ntransfer equation in the co-moving frame subject to statistical and radiative equilibrium, assuming an expanding, spherically-symmetric, homogeneous and static atmosphere, allowing\nfor line blanketing and clumping. The stellar radius (R\u2217 ) is defined as the inner boundary\nof the model atmosphere and is located at Rosseland optical depth of \u223c20 with the stellar\ntemperature (T\u2217 ) defined by the usual Stefan-Boltzmann relation.\nOur approach follows previous studies (e.g. Crowther et al. 2002), such that diagnostic\noptical lines of C ii \u03bb4267, C iii \u03bb5696 and C iv \u03bb\u03bb5801-12 plus the local continuum level allow\na determination of the stellar temperature, mass-loss rate and luminosity. In contrast with\nearlier WC subtypes, a reliable treatment of low temperature de-electronic recombination C ii\nlines is necessary in WC9 stars. These lines are not included in Opacity Project calculations,\nso improved superstructure calculations were carried out by P.J. Storey on our behalf.\nOur final model atom contains He i-ii, C ii-iv, O ii-iv, Ne ii-iv, Si iii-iv, S iii-vi, Ar iiiv, Ca ii-vi and Fe iii-vi. In total, 987 super levels, 3497 full levels and 40,952 non-LTE\ntransitions are simultaneously considered. We assume hydrogen is absent, with variable C,\nO and Ne abundances, and Si\u2013Fe initially fixed at Solar values (Grevesse & Sauval 1998).\nAs for other WC subtypes, C/He abundances are ideally obtained from He ii \u03bb5411 and\nC iv \u03bb5471. Since these lines are weak in WC9 stars, the accuracy with which C/He may\nbe obtained in this way is reduced relative to earlier subtypes, but should be accurate to\n\u00b10.1 by number. For oxygen, O ii \u03bb4415\u20134417, O iii \u03bb3754\u20133759, \u03bb5592 provide the cleanest\noxygen diagnostics in the visual region, and should permit a determination of O/He to within\na factor of two. Williams & van der Hucht (2000) revealed that WC9 stars span a range in\nO ii \u03bb4415-4417 line strength, suggesting a factor of \u22652 spread in oxygen abundance.\nWe adopt a standard form of the velocity law, v(r) = v\u221e (1 \u2212 R\u2217 /r)\u03b2 , where \u03b2=1. The\n\u221a\nmass-loss rate is actually derived as the ratio \u1e40 / f , where f is the volume filling factor\nthat can be constrained by fits to the electron scattering wings of the helium line profiles\n(following Hillier 1991) resulting in f \u223c0.1. From the observed strength of electron scattering\nwings we can definitely exclude homogeneous mass-loss in both HD 164270 and BD+30 3639.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.2.\n\nPhysical and Wind properties\n\nWe compare our synthetic model of HD 164270 to de-reddened UV (IUE) and optical\n(AAT) spectroscopic observations in Fig. 4. The agreement between the spectral features and\ncontinuum is generally excellent. The majority of synthetic near-UV and optical (primarily\nHe, C, O) lines match observations to within \u223c30%. The only exception is C iii \u03bb4647\u201350\nwhich is too weak. This can be resolved with a 5% higher temperature, at the expense\nof other fits to optical lines. In the far-UV, numerous Fe features dominate the spectral\nappearance, together with C and Si resonance lines. The synthetic Fe spectrum is generally\ntoo strong is emission, as are Si iii \u03bb1295\u20131312 and the blue component of Si iv \u03bb1393\u20131402,\nwhilst C iii \u03bb2297 is 30% too weak. C iv \u03bb1548\u201351 is too weak in emission at a stellar\ntemperature of 48kK. As with C iii \u03bb4647\u201351, this can be reproduced at a slightly higher\ntemperature, albeit with poorer agreement in the iron forest around \u03bb1450.\nWe compare the de-reddened F USE far-UV spectrum of HD 164270 to the synthetic\nspectrum in Fig. 5. Agreement is reasonable longward of \u03bb1120, where few molecular H2\nlines absent, including the Si iv \u03bb1122\u201328 doublet, whilst Lyman and Werner molecular bands\ndominate the spectrum at shorter wavelengths, as demonstrated by the apparent absence of\nthe C ii \u03bb1037 in the F USE dataset (see also Willis et al. 2004).\nFor completeness, we compare UV (IUE) and optical (WHT) spectrophotometry of\nBD+30 3639 to our synthetic model in Fig. 6. Comments are as for HD 164270, except for\nthe strong nebular emission superimposed upon the stellar spectrum. The stellar parameters\nderived for each star are presented in Table 1. The derived stellar temperature of BD+30\n3639 is higher than HD 164270 due to its smaller physical size, whilst their wind efficiencies,\n\u03b7 = \u1e40 v\u221e /(L/c) are effectively identical, despite stellar masses a factor of ten different. Mass\nestimates originate from the H-free mass-luminosity relation of Schaerer & Maeder (1992)\nfor HD 164270, and Herwig et al. (1999) for BD+30 3639.\nRecent theoretical (Herwig et al. 2003) and observational (Reiff et al. 2005) evidence\nsuggests that H-deficient PG1159 stars (for which [WC] subtypes are likely precursors) are\nseverely Fe-depleted. Thus far we have adopted Solar (Grevesse & Sauval 1998) heavy metal\nabundances. Consequently, we additionally considered models in which the iron content is\nreduced by a factor of ten with respect to Solar. This reduced iron model compares rather\nmore favorably to observation in the \u03bb1400\u20131700 region (Fe iv-v), whilst the Solar Fe model\nis in better agreement for \u03bb \u22651800 (also Fe iv). Recall, however that the synthetic far-UV\nspectrum for HD 164270 was also rather too strong with respect to observations, so a more\nrobust result awaits improved spectroscopic fits across the entire far-UV. Fortunately, the\nquestion of Fe depletion in BD+30 3639 does not affect our main aim of the present study,\nsince the optical spectroscopic appearance of the Solar and Fe-depleted models are virtually\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nidentical.\n\n3.3.\n\nComparison with previous results\n\nOur derived stellar temperature of T\u2217 \u223c 48kK for HD 164270 is rather higher than the\nprevious estimate of 30kK for WC9 stars, based on pure helium model atmospheres (Howarth\n& Schmutz 1992). This follows the general trend in which the inclusion of line blanketing\nleads to an increase in stellar temperatures for WR stars (Crowther 2003b). The present\nstudy represents the first detailed investigation of any WC9 star, it is in good agreement\nwith the estimate of 45kK for WR104 by Crowther (1997) using a He, C and O non-LTE\nmodel.\nSince late-WC stars are preferentially dust formers, we note that the ionizing flux distribution of HD 164270 is rather harder than those commonly adopted in chemical and radiative\ntransfer studies of dust in such environments (e.g. Williams et al. 1987; Cherchneff et al.\n2000). One notable exception is the 3D dust radiative transfer study of WR104 (Pinwheel\nnebula) by Harries et al. (2004) for which a similar stellar spectral energy distribution to\nthe current study was adopted. The origins of dust around Population I late WC stars is\nstill under debate, although recent studies suggest a binary system is required to provide\nH-rich material and the necessary shielding from the intense radiation for grain formation\n(Crowther 2003a). To date, there is no evidence for a luminous companion to HD 164270\n(Smith & Aller 1971).\nBD+30 3639 has been studied by Leuenhagen et al. (1996) using a non-LTE model\natmosphere study, also allowing for He, C and O, such that blanketing and clumping were\nneglected. As with HD 164270, we obtain 55kK versus 47kK from Leuenhagen et al. (1996).\nHowever, blanketing tends to redistribute high energy photons to lower energy, leading to\na softer ionizing flux distribution. In Table 1 we include the Lyman and He i continuum\nionizing fluxes for both stars. The relatively soft radiation explains why previous nebular\ntechniques have obtained substantially lower estimates of the stellar temperature (e.g. 34kK:\nSiebenmorgen et al. 1994). In contrast to the amorphous carbon nature of dust associated\nwith late WC stars (Williams et al. 1987), the PN associated with BD+30 3639 exhibits\ncrystalline silicate dust, signaling a recent change from an oxygen- to carbon-dominated\nchemistry (Waters et al. 1998). De Marco et al. (2003) argue binarity could naturally\nexplain the dual dust chemistry of PN and the H-depletion of the CSPN.\nFinally, if we scale the Leuenhagen et al result for BD+30 3639 to our assumed distance\nof 1.2 kpc, we obtain a revised luminosity of log L/L\u2299 = 4.0, versus 3.8 obtained here, and\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\na (homogeneous) mass-loss rate of 4\u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 versus our estimate of 3\u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n\n3.4.\n\nHigher radio derived mass-loss rates for WC9 stars\n\nLeitherer et al. (1997) obtained an upper limit to the 6cm radio flux for HD 164270\nof <0.42 mJy, equating to a homogeneous mass-loss rate of < 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 under\nthe assumption of singly ionized He, C and O for the radio forming continuum, versus\n\u221a\n\u1e40 / f \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 obtained here from an analysis of the UV, optical and near-IR\nspectrum. Since the radio estimate is recognized as providing the least model dependent\nmass-loss rates of Wolf-Rayet stars, does the present study contradict the radio results?\nFig. 7 presents the theoretical wind structure of our HD 164270 model, including the\nvariation of electron temperature, electron density, velocity and stellar radius versus Rosseland optical depth, together with the ionization balance of the principal elements, namely\nHe, C, O, Fe. We also include Ne and S since we consider their ionization state in the outer\nwinds in Sect. 3.5. The winds of WC9 stars are highly stratified, such that for example S6+\nis the dominant ion of sulfur in the inner wind (\u223c1014 cm\u22123 ), whilst S2+ is the dominant ion\nin the outer wind (\u223c107 cm\u22123 ).\nFrom the figure, our model atmosphere supports the dominant ionization stages of C+\nand O+ in the outer wind, whilst He is partially recombined beyond several hundred R\u2217.\nTherefore, the claimed lower limit to the radio mass-loss rate by Leitherer et al. (1997) will\nincrease. In fact, our model atmosphere predicts 2cm and 6cm radio fluxes of only 0.2mJy\nand 0.09mJy, respectively, for HD 164270. Similar arguments apply to the apparently low\nmass-loss rates of WC9 stars derived from radio observations by Cappa et al. (2004). As a\nconsequence, their conclusions that WC9 stars possess weaker winds than earlier subtypes\nis not necessarily valid.\n\n3.5.\n\nElemental abundances\n\nWe admit a greater uncertainty in C/He for WC9 stars with respect to earlier WC\nstars due to the weakness of the diagnostic He ii \u03bb5411 and C iv \u03bb5471 lines. We obtain\nC/He\u223c0.2\u00b10.1 for HD 164270 and C/He\u223c0.25\u00b10.1 for BD+30 3639, by number. O ii lines at\n\u03bb4415\u20134417, O iii \u03bb3754\u20133759, \u03bb5592 represent the primary abundance diagnostics, revealing\nO/He\u223c0.01 for HD 164270 and O/He\u223c0.05 for BD+30 3639, which ought to be reliable to\na factor of two. No abundance studies have previously been reported for HD 164270, whilst\nLeuenhagen et al. (1996) derived C/He=0.37 and O/He=0.03, by number for BD+30 3639.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nThe fine-structure lines of [Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm and [S iii] \u03bb18.7\u03bcm observed in HD 164270\n(Fig. 1) permit the determination of ion fractions of Ne+ and S2+ in the outer wind of\nHD 164270. The critical densities for these fine-structure lines (\u223c 105 cm\u22123 ) relate to the\nconstant velocity regime at several thousand stellar radii in WC9 stars, comparable to the\nradio forming continuum. We determine abundances using numerical techniques introduced\nby Barlow et al. (1988), adapted to account for a clumped wind by Dessart et al. (2000) and\nSmith & Houck (2005). With regard to clumping, the volume filling factor within this region\nmay be quite distinct from that estimated using optical recombination lines (Runacres &\nOwocki 2002).\nThe numerical expression for the ion number fraction, \u03b3i , in a clumped medium (with\nvolume filling factor f ) is (in cgs units)\n(4\u03c0\u03bcmH v\u221e )1.5\n\u03b3i =\nln(10)f 0.25\n\n\u0012\u221a \u00131.5\n2D 2 Iul\n1\nf\n\u221a\nFu (T ) \u03b3e Aul h\u03bdul\n\u1e40\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D is the stellar distance, Iul is the line flux of the transition with energy h\u03bdul between\nupper level u and lower level l, with transition probability Aul . \u03b3e (=1.0) and Te (=6000K)\nare the electron number density and temperature in the line-forming region, and the mean\nmolecular weight is \u03bc (=5.5) for HD 164270, with mH the mass of the hydrogen atom. The\nintegral part, Fu (T ), is\nZ \u221e\nfu (Ne , T )\n\u221a\nFu (T ) =\nd log(Ne ).\n(2)\nNe\n0\nwhere fu is the fractional population of the upper level.\nFollowing this technique, we derive \u03b3N e+ = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u03b3S 2+ = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Consequently, Ne+ /He = 2.2\u00d710\u22123 and S2+ /He = 5.1\u00d710\u22125 by number. Of course, one needs to\naccount for potential contributions from unseen ionization stages. From Fig. 7, our model\natmosphere predicts that Ne+ and S2+ are the dominant ions of neon and sulfur at the\nouter model radius of 1000R\u2217 , where log(ne /cm3 ) \u223c6.7. A similar degree of ionization at\nlog(ne /cm3 ) \u223c4.5\u20135.8, where the [S iii] and [Ne ii] fine-structure lines form, is supported by\nthe absence of the [S iv] 10.5\u03bcm and [Ne iii] 15.5\u03bcm fine-structure lines, although we cannot\nexclude contributions from Ne0 and S+ .\nConsequently, we can set a lower limit to the Ne/He ratio with Ne+ /He = 2.2\u00d710\u22123 .\nThis implies a minimum mass fraction of neon of 0.7%, a factor of 7 times higher than the\nSolar value of Ne/H \u223c 7.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 by number, as recently re-derived by Asplund et al. (2004)\nand Lodders (2003)2 . For sulphur, we can equally set a minimum abundance of sulfur with\n2\n\nNote that the Bahcall et al. (2005) propose a higher Ne abundance of Ne/H=1.9\u00d710\u22124 by number in or-\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nS2+ /He = 5.1\u00d710\u22125 . This indicates a minimum sulfur mass fraction of 0.024%, a factor of\ntwo times lower than the Solar mass fraction, with an unknown fraction singly ionized.\nSmith & Houck (2005) have recently estimated the Ne abundance of AS320 (WR121,\nWC9d) based on ground-based [Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm spectroscopy. They estimated Ne+ /He =\n4.1\u00d710\u22123 , based on the analytical approach of Barlow et al. (1998), a mass-loss rate that\nwas 0.1 dex lower than a radio derived upper limit (though recall Sect 3.4), plus average\nC/He abundances for WC8\u20139 stars from the literature. The more accurate numerical technique applied above typically leads to a 10\u201320% reduction in ion abundance relative to the\nanalytical approach. Since [Ne iii] 15.5\u03bcm is unavailable from the ground, Smith & Houck\n(2005) inspected our HD 164270 Spitzer IRS dataset, which confirmed that Ne+ instead of\nNe2+ is the dominant ion in the outer wind of WC9 stars.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nWe have presented the first quantitative, multi-wavelength spectroscopic study of a\nmassive WC9 star, HD 164270. Overall, the non-LTE model is remarkably successful at\nreproducing the far-UV to mid-IR spectrum of HD 164270 such that we can be confident in\nthe resulting physical and chemical properties.\nWith respect to earlier subtypes, WC9 stars genuinely possess lower stellar temperatures. However, we find a similar C/He for HD 164270 to earlier WC subtypes, based on\nidentical abundance diagnostics, contrary to the decreasing C/He ratio for later WC subtypes proposed by Smith & Maeder (1991). This is emphasised in Fig. 8 which compares\nthe carbon and neon abundances of all Galactic WC stars analysed by Dessart et al. (2000)\nto which we have added HD 164270. Chemically, WC9 stars therefore appear normal with\nrespect to earlier WC subtypes. This conclusion is supported by Smith & Houck (2005) who\nestimated Ne/He=4.1\u00d710\u22123 for another WC9 star, AS320, using ground-based spectroscopy,\nalbeit with an uncertain, radio-derived mass-loss rate. Indeed, we shall suggest below that\nthe presence of a WC dense wind intrinsically leads to a late-type WC star, so one might\nactually expect a substantial range of C/He within WC9 stars, as suggested by Williams et\nal. (2005).\nIn Fig. 8 we also include the predicted neon versus carbon enrichment during the WC\nstage for an initial 60M\u2299 star at Z=0.020 initially rotating at 300 km/s from Meynet &\nder to resolve the downward revised oxygen content of the Sun by Asplund et al. (2004) with helioseismology\nmeasurements.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nMaeder (2003). HD 164270 supports the previous results from Dessart et al. (2000) that\nmeasured Ne enrichments fall a factor of 2\u20133 times lower than predictions. During the\nearly WC phase it is 22 Ne enrichment by up to a factor of 200, rather than the initially\nmore abundant 20 Ne which dominates the predicted enrichment. This increase is dictated\nby reaction rates and is unrelated to rotation (Meynet & Meynet 2003). Considering this\npoor agreement, a Spitzer guest investigator program is presently underway to study a larger\nsample of WC and WO stars to assess whether the relatively modest Ne enrichments obtained\nto date are typical.\nCrowther et al. (2002) concluded that the defining characteristic distinguishing mid and\nearly WC subtypes was primarily due to a higher wind density in the former, rather than\nsignificantly lower stellar temperature. One would be able to readily explain the observed\npreference of WC9 stars to inhabit high metallicity regions (e.g. Hopewell et al. 2005;\nHadfield et al. 2005) if the wind strengths of WC stars increased with metallicity (Vink &\nde Koter 2005), i.e. high wind densities produce late subtypes, without the need for reduced\nstellar temperatures.\nIn contrast, radio mass-loss determinations of WC9 stars by Leitherer et al. (1997) and\nCappa et al. (2004) suggest that they possess relatively low wind densities. However, helium\nis assumed to be singly ionized in radio mass-loss rate determinations, whilst Fig. 7 indicates\nthat helium is partially recombined in the outer winds of WC9 stars. Consequently, previous\nradio mass-loss rate estimates for WC9 stars represent lower (rather than upper) limits.\nIn Fig. 9 we present the mass-loss rate versus luminosity relationship obtained for\nGalactic Wolf-Rayet stars by Nugis & Lamers (2000) for an assumed metal content of\nC/He=0.25 and C/O=5 by number, together with Galactic and LMC spectroscopic results\nfrom Crowther et al. (2002) and references therein, plus HD 164270. The generic relation\nof Nugis & Lamers is very successful at reproducing the mass-loss rates of Galactic WC5\u20137\nstars. LMC WC4 stars possess low mass-loss rates for their high luminosities and \u03b3 Vel\n(WC8+O7.5 III) and HD 164270 (WC9) possess high mass-loss rates for their low luminosities. Despite our small sample, one might conclude that late WC stars result from high wind\ndensities instead of low stellar temperatures. However, stellar temperatures of \u03b3 Vel (De\nMarco et al. 2000) and HD 164270 are the lowest of the entire sample, so the low ionization\nof WC8\u20139 stars appears to result from a combination of both high wind density and low\nstellar temperature.\nNote that there is also an apparent trend for higher luminosities (masses) at earlier\nsubtype in Fig. 9, although the reduced mass-loss rates prior to the Wolf-Rayet phase for\nthe LMC stars relative to the Milky Way counterparts probably dominates this difference.\nNevertheless, Galactic WC5\u20137 stars reveal higher present masses than WC8\u20139 stars (recall\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nall have well established distances with the exception of HD 164270).\nThe recent suggestion of severe Fe-depletion in the likely precursors of late [WC] stars\n(Herwig et al. 2003; Reiff et al. 2005) potentially impacts upon the ability of the star to\nexhibit a strong wind. Indeed, Gr\u00e4fener & Hamann (2005) and Vink & de Koter (2005)\nboth argue that winds of Wolf-Rayet stars are driven by radiation pressure with Fe-peak\nelements the principal components of the line driving. Consequently, a significant Fe depletion in BD+30 3639 might potentially reduce its wind density to significantly below that of\nHD 164270. Without the line driving from Fe-peak elements, [WC] subtypes may either be\nunlikely to occur, or possess very different wind properties from their Population I cousins.\nIn contrast, we have demonstrated quantitatively that the winds of HD 164270 (WC9) and\nBD+30 3639 ([WC9]) are remarkably similar, supporting the earlier descriptive result from\nSmith & Aller (1971), despite very different evolutionary states, arguing against a severely\ndepleted Fe-content in BD+30 3639.\nFinally, we should emphasize that the physical and wind properties derived here for\nHD 164270 and BD+30 3639 are not based on self-consistent hydrodynamical models,\ni.e. mass-loss rates are imposed. Great progress towards such fully consistent models for\nWolf-Rayet stars is now underway towards self-consistent wind models (notably Gr\u00e4fener\n& Hamann 2005). In the meantime, from our comparison between WC and [WC] stars it\nappears that the combination of a hydrogen-deficient, metal-rich composition and intense radiation field are sufficient conditions for the development of a strong stellar wind, regardless\nof the evolutionary history (or present mass) of the star.\nThanks to John Hillier for providing CMFGEN and making modifications to incorporate\nnew C ii superstructure calculations by Pete Storey.
