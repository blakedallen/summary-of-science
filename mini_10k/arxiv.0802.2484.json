CHIRAL SYMMETRY\nThe outer components of nuclear forces are dominated by pion-exchanges and involve just a few basic subamplitudes, describing pion interactions with either nucleons or other pions. The simplest process N \u2192 \u03c0N , corresponding to the emission or\nabsorption of a single pion by a nucleon, is rather well understood and gives rise to\nthe one-pion exchange NN potential (OP EP ). The scattering reaction \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c0N\ncomes next and determines both the very important two-pion exchange term in the\nNN force and the leading three-body interaction, as shown in Fig.1.\n\n(a)\nFig. 1.\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFree \u03c0N amplitude (a) and two-pion exchange two-body (b) and three-body (c) potentials.\n\nThe theoretical understanding of the \u03c0N amplitude proved to be very challenging and a suitable description was only produced by means of chiral symmetry.\nThis framework provides a natural explanation for the observed smallness of \u03c0N\nscattering lengths and plays a fundamental role in Nuclear Physics. Nowadays, the\nuse of chiral symmetry in low-energy pion-interactions is justified by QCD.\n1\n\n\fOctober 27, 2018 18:36 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nRobilotta \u0307Osaka\n\nM. R. Robilotta\n\nThe small masses of the quarks u and d, treated as perturbations in a chiral\nsymmetric lagrangian, give rise to a well defined chiral perturbation theory (ChPT).\nHadronic amplitudes are then expanded in terms of a typical scale q, set by either\npion four-momenta or nucleon three-momenta, such that q \u226a 1 GeV. This procedure\nis rigorous and many results have the status of theorems. In general, these theorems\nare written as power series in the scale q and involve both leading order terms and\nchiral corrections. The former can usually be derived from tree diagrams, whereas\nthe latter require the inclusion of pion loops and are the main object of ChPT.\nAt each order, predictions for a given process must be unique and the inclusion of\ncorrections cannot change already existing leading terms.\nThe relationship between chiral expansions of the \u03c0N amplitude and of two-pion\nexchange (T P E) nuclear forces is discussed in the sequence. For the \u03c0N amplitude,\ntree diagrams yield O(q, q 2 ) terms and corrections up to O(q 4 ) have already been\nevaluated, by means of both covariant1(CF) and heavy baryon2 (HBF) formalisms.\nIn the case of the NN potential, the leading term is O(q 0 ) and given by the OP EP .\nThe tree-level \u03c0N amplitude yields T P E contributions at O(q 2 , q 3 ) and corrections\nat O(q 4 ) are available, based on both HBF3 and CF4,5 . Tree-level \u03c0N results also\ndetermine the leading O(q 3 ) three-body force and partial corrections at O(q 4 ) begin\nto be derived 6,7 . As this discussion suggests, O(q 4 ) corrections to both two- and\nthree-nucleon forces require just the O(q 3 ) \u03c0N amplitude.\nThe full empirical content of the \u03c0N amplitude cannot be predicted by chiral\nsymmetry alone. Experimental information at low energies is usually encoded into\nthe subthreshold coefficients introduced by H\u00f6hler and collaborators8 which can,\nif needed, be translated into the low-energy contants (LECs) of chiral lagrangians.\nTherefore, in order to construct a O(q 3 ) \u03c0N amplitude, one uses chiral symmetry supplemented by subthreshold information, as indicated in Fig. 2. The first\ntwo diagrams correspond to the nucleon pole, whereas the other ones represent a\nsmooth background. The third graph reproduces the Weinberg-Tomozawa contact\ninteraction, the fourth one summarizes LEC contributions and the last two describe\nmedium range pion-cloud effects.\n\n=\n\n+\nFig. 2.\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nRepresentation of the \u03c0N amplitude at O(q 3 ).\n\n\fOctober 27, 2018 18:36 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nRobilotta \u0307Osaka\n\nNuclear Interactions: the Chiral Picture\n\n3\n\n2. TWO-BODY POTENTIAL\nWith the purpose of discussing the problem of predicted \u00d7 observed chiral hierarchies, in this section we review briefly results obtained by our goup4,5 for the\nT P E-NN potential at O(q 4 ). This component is determined by the three families\nof diagrams shown in Fig. 3. Family I begins at O(q 2 ) and implements the minimal\nrealization of chiral symmetry9 , whereas family II depends on \u03c0\u03c0 correlations and\nis O(q 4 ). They involve only the constants gA and f\u03c0 and all dependence on the\nLECs is concentrated in family III, which begins at O(q 3 ).\nI\n\n{\n\nII\n\n{\n\nIII\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\n{\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\nFig. 3.\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\nDynamical structure of the two-pion exchange potential.\n\n10\n\n0.20\n\n0\n\n0.00\n\n30\n\n1.5\n\n20\n\n1.0\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n\u2212\n\n0.40\n\nVT (MeV)\n\n20\n\n\u2212\n\nVSS (MeV)\n\nAs far as chiral orders of magnitude are concerned, on finds that the various\n+\ncomponents of the force begin as follows5 : O(q 2 ) \u2192 VSS\n, VT+ , VC\u2212 and O(q 3 ) \u2192\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nVC+ , VLS\n, VLS\n, VSS\n, VT\u2212 , where the superscripts (+) and (\u2212) refer to terms proportional to either the identity or \u03c4 (1) *\u03c4 (2) in isospin space.

THREE-BODY POTENTIAL\nThe leading term in the three-nucleon potential, known as T P E-3N P , has long\nrange and corresponds to the process shown in fig.1c, in which a pion is emitted by\none of the nucleons, scattered by a second one, and absorbed by the last nucleon.\nIs this case, the intermediate \u03c0N amplitude, which is O(q) for free pions, becomes\nO(q 2 ) and the three-body force begins at O(q 3 ). The first modern version of this\ncomponent of the force was produced by Fujita and Miyazawa12, its chiral structure\nhas bee much debated since the seventies13 and, nowadays, a sort o consensus has\nbeen reached about its form14 . The leading T P E-3N P has a generic structure given\nby\no\n\u0003\n\u03bc n \u0002\n\u03b4ab a \u03bc \u2212 b \u03bc3 \u220712 *\u220723 + d \u03bc3 i \u01ebbac \u03c4c(2) i \u03c3(2) *\u220712 \u00d7 \u220723\nVL (123) = \u2212\n2\n(4\u03c0)\ni\ni h\nh\n(3)\n\u00d7 (gA \u03bc/2 f\u03c0 ) \u03c4a(1) \u03c3 (1) *\u220712 (gA \u03bc/2 f\u03c0 ) \u03c4b \u03c3 (3) *\u220723 Y (x12 ) Y (x23 ) ,\nwhere \u03bc is the pion mass and a, b and d are strength parameters, determined by\neither LECs or subhtreshold coefficients.\nThe evaluation of O(q 4 ) corrections requires the inclusion of single loop effects\nand is associated with a large number of diagrams, which are being calculated by\nEpelbaum and collaborators7. In order to produce a feeling for the structure of\nthese corrections, we discuss a particular set of processes belonging to the T P E3N P class, considered recently6 . Full results involve expressions which are too long\nand cumbersome to be displayed here. However, their main qualitative features can\nbe summarized in the structure V (123) = VL (123) + [V\u03b4L (123) + \u03b4V (123)], where\nVL is the leading term shown above and the factors within square brackets are\nChPT corrections. The function V\u03b4L can be obtained directly from VL , by replacing\n(a, b, c) \u2192 (\u03b4a, \u03b4b, \u03b4c), where the \u03b4s indicate changes smaller than 10%. This part\nof the ChPT correction corresponds just to shifts in the parameters of the leading\ncomponent. The term \u03b4V (123), on the other hand, represents effects associated with\nnew mathematical functions involving both non-local operators and complicated\npropagators containg loop integrals, in place of the Yukawa functions. The strengths\nof these new functions are determined by a new set of parameters ei , which are also\ntypically about 10% of the leading ones.\nIn summary, ChPT gives rise both to small changes in already existing coefficients and to the appearance of many new mathematical structures. The latter are\nthe most interesting ones, since they may be instrumental in explaining effects such\nas the Ay puzzle.\n4. THE CHIRAL PICTURE\nChiral symmetry has already been applied to about 20 components of nuclear forces,\nallowing a comprehensive picture to be assessed. According to ChPT, the various\neffects begin to appear at different orders and the predicted hierarchy is displayed\nin the table below.\n\n\fOctober 27, 2018 18:36 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n6\n\nRobilotta \u0307Osaka\n\nM.

In general, convergence at distances\nof physical interest is satisfactory, except for VC+ , where the ratio between O(q 4 )\nand O(q 3 ) contributions is larger than 0.5 for distances smaller than 2.5 fm.\nAs far as the relative sizes of the various dynamical effects are concerned, one\nfinds strong violations of the predicted hierarchy when one compares VC+ with VC\u2212\n+\nand VD+ with VLS\n, as discussed above. It is interesting to note that, in both cases, the\nunexpected enhancements occur in the isoscalar sector. The numerical explanation\nfor this behavior is that some of the LECs used in the calculation are large and\ngenerated dynamically by delta intermediate states. However, it is also possible\nthat perturbation theory may not apply to isoscalar interactions at intermediate\ndistances. This aspect of the problem is explored in the next section.\n5. SCALAR FORM FACTOR\nThe structure of VC+ was scrutinized in Ref.5 and found to be heavily dominated\nby a term of the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\nVC+ (r) \u223c \u2212 (4/f\u03c02) (c3 \u2212 2c1 ) \u2212 c3 \u22072 /2 \u03c3\u0303NN (r) ,\n\nwhere the ci are LECs and \u03c3\u0303NN is the leading contribution from the pion cloud to the\nnucleon scalar form factor. This close relationship between \u03c3\u0303NN and VC+ indicates\nthat the study of the former can shed light into the properties of the latter.\nThe nucleon scalar form factor is defined as\nhN (p\u2032 )|\u2212Lsb |N (p)i = \u03c3N (t) \u016b(p\u2032 ) u(p) ,\n\nwhere Lsb is the symmetry breaking lagrangian. It has already been expanded1 up\nto O(q 4 ) and receives its leading O(q 2 ) contribution from a tree diagram associated\nwith the LEC c1 . Corrections at O(q 3 ) and O(q 4 ) are produced by two triangle\ndiagrams, involving nucleon and delta intermediate states. In configuration space15 ,\nthe scalar form factor is denoted by \u03c3\u0303 and one writes\n\u03c3\u0303N (r) = \u22124 c1 \u03bc2 \u03b4 3 (r) + \u03c3\u0303NN (r) + \u03c3\u0303N\u2206 (r) ,\nwhere \u03c3\u0303NN and \u03c3\u0303N\u2206 are the finite-range triangle contributions.\nThe symmetry breaking lagrangian can be expressed in terms of the chiral angle \u03b8\nas Lsb = f\u03c02 \u03bc2 (cos \u03b8\u22121). The ratio \u03c3\u0303N (r)/(\u03bc2 f\u03c02 ) = (1\u2212cos \u03b8) describes the density\n\n\fOctober 27, 2018 18:36 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nRobilotta \u0307Osaka\n\nNuclear Interactions: the Chiral Picture\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u03c3\u039d\n\n\u039d\n\n1.8\n\n\u03c3\u039d\n\n\u03c3\u039d\n\n2\n\u039d\n\n1.4\n1.2\n\n\u03c3N /\u03c3N\n\n1\n\n\u2206\n\n2 2\n\n2.5\n\n\u2206\n\n1.6\n\u03c3/(f\u03c0 \u03bc )\n\n7\n\n0.8\n\n1.5\n1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\nr(fm)\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nr(fm)\n\nFig. 7.

One notes that\nit vanishes at large distances and increases monotonically as one approaches the\ncenter. This means that the function \u03c3\u0303N (r) becomes meaningless beyond a critical\nradius R, corresponding to \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, since the physical interpretation of the quark\ncondensate requires the condition q q\u0304 > 0. In Ref. 15, the condensate was assumed\nto no longer exist in the region r < R and the \u03c0N sigma-term was evaluated using\nthe expression\nZ \u221e\n4\ndr r2 \u03c3\u0303N (r) .\n\u03c3N = \u03c0R3 f\u03c02 \u03bc2 + 4\u03c0\n3\nR\nThis procedure yields 43 MeV< \u03c3N < 49 MeV, depending on the value adopted\nfor the \u03c0N \u2206 coupling constant, in agreement with the empirical value 45\u00b18 MeV.\nThis picture of the nucleon scalar form factor is sound and can be used to gain\ninsight about VC+ .\nInspecting Fig. 7 (right), one learns that the hierarchy predicted by ChPT is\nsubverted for distances smaller than 1.5 fm, since the O(q 4 ) delta becomes more\nimportant than the O(q 3 ) nucleon. On the other hand, the good prediction obtained\nfor the nucleon \u03c3-term (and also for the \u2206 \u03c3-term15 ) indicates that the functions\n\u03c3\u0303NN (r) and \u03c3\u0303N\u2206 (r) can be trusted up to the critical radius R \u223c 0.6 fm. Just outside\nthis radius, the chiral angle is close to \u03c0/2, indicating that the pion cloud is nonperturbative in that region. This picture is supported by Fig. 5 (right) since, at least\nup to 1 fm, the prediction for VC+ agrees well with the Argonne phenomenological\npotentials. This leads to our main conclusion, namely that the range of validity\nof calculations based on nucleon and delta intermediate states is wider that that\npredicted by ChPT.\nAcknowledgments\nIt was a great pleasure participating in the Chiral 2007 meeting and I would like\nto thank the organizers for the very nice conference, for the warm and friendly\nhospitality, and for supporting my stay in Osaka.\n\n\fOctober 27, 2018 18:36 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n8\n\nRobilotta \u0307Osaka\n\nM.
