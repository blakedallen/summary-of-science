In addition, we are encouraged by the rapid\nand reliable compound synthesis as well as the commercial availability MgB2 powders\nfor the technological applications such as MgB2 wires/ribbons.\n\nThe Bi-cuprates were\n\nthe first to be fabricated into wires/ribbons in lengths with enough texture to provide\ngood intergrain current transport.\n\nThe ir application, however, is restricted because\n\nthey have a low lying irreversibility line Hirr(T). In developing MgB2 wires/ribbons,\nrecently Jin et al. 8 showed the fabrication of dense and metal-clad MgB2 superconductor\nwire with transport Jc of greater than 36,000 A/cm2 . The critical current density Jc\nevaluated by magnetization measurement was reported to be 105 ~ 106 A/cm2 in dense\nbulk MgB2 ,2,10 ~ 5 \u00d7 105 in dense MgB2 wire,5 and ~ 6 \u00d7 106 in thin films of MgB2 ,6 at\nliquid helium temperature. To progress in the development of MgB2 wires/ribbons\nwith high Jc for industrial applications, it will be necessary to find optimum conditions\nfor fabrication. Because of hampering properties such as the volatility and reactivity\nof magnesium, however, forming practical products, MgB2 wires/ribbons, presents some\nchallenges for us.\nIn this letter, we report the successful fabrication of single-filament composite\nMgB2 /SUS ribbons, as an ultra-robust conductor type, employing the powder-in-tube\n\n2\n\n\f(PIT) process.\n\nIn addition to describing the fabrication by swaging and cold rolling\n\nonly, we report the superconducting results of both a sintered and a non-sintered singlefilament composite MgB2 /SUS ribbon.\n\nThe SUS-304 used as a metal cladding is an\n\naustenitic stainless steel. It is very critical point to pick a good complementary clad\nmaterial for the MgB2 superconductor.\n\nThe synthesized or commercially available\n\nMgB2 powders are fine grain polycrystalline superconductors that are mechanically hard,\na bit brittle, and crumbling. When we fabricate the metal-clad MgB2 wires/ribbons,\nhard, but ductile and malleable metals are essential. They have to play a key role as a\ndiffusion barrier for the volatile and reactive magnesium.\n\nFurthermore, they should be\n\nstrong clad materials to form dense and tiny grain superconducting wires/ribbons, due to\npressure on processes such as swaging and rolling.\nAfter careful consideration of many possible materials, we decided to use SUS-304\n(a type of stainless steel) tubes as a clad metal for MgB2 ribbons as well as a diffusion\nbarrier for sintering at high temperature near 900o C.\n\nThe SUS-304 tube had an\n\noutside diameter of 10.5 mm, a wall thickness of 2.4 mm, and a length of 150 mm.\nFirst, one end of the SUS-304 tube was sealed by plugging it with a short tight-fitting\nSUS-304 rod. The commercially available MgB2 powder (from Alfa Aesar) was then\nfilled and packed inside the tube by pressing the SUS-304 rod with a hammer, in argon\natmosphere. The other end of the tube was sealed by plugging it with a rod, as well.\nThe MgB2 powder inside the tube had an initial packing density of approximately 1.47\ng/cm3 (sintering sample) and 1.64 g/cm3 (non-sintering sample). The tube filled with\nMgB2 powder was then swaged down to a 2 ~ 3 mm diameter rod step by step, with\ncooling the composite tube by water. This swaging was followed cold rolling of many\nsteps, each with a thickness reduction of ~ 10 %.\n\n3\n\nFinally, the single-filament\n\n\fcomposite MgB2 /SUS ribbons reached a ribbon geometry with a thickness of ~ 0.8 mm,\na width of ~ 5 mm, and a length of ~ 1 m. Without cutting, one of the prototype\nribbons (initial packing density of 1.47 g/cm3 ) was given a sintering treatment at 900o C\nfor 1 hour in an argon atmosphere, with additional sealing both ends of ribbons by Ararc soldering. We estimate that the loss of mass during sintering is almost zero, except\nvery small areas of reaction between MgB2 and SUS-304 tube.\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer\n(EPMA-1600) investigations for both the sintered and the non-sintered MgB2 /SUS\nribbons are shown in Fig. 1-(a) ~ (d). Fig. 1-(a) and -(b) show the typical transverse\ncross sections.\n\nIn Fig. 1-(c) and -(d) are shown the EPMA line profiles of the regions\n\nmarked in Fig. 1-(a) and -(b), for both the sintered and the non-sintered MgB2 /SUS\nribbons, respectively. The superconductor core cross section areas of the composite\nMgB2 /SUS ribbons that show irregular forms are about 0.67 and 1.13 mm2 for the\nsintered and the non-sintered one, with the superconductor filling factor of about 19.5\nand 30.0 %, respectively.\n\nUsual SUS-304 consists of 20 % Cr, 10 % Ni, 2 % Mn, 1 %\n\nSi, very small potions of other elements, and the remainder is Fe. No evidence of\nsignificant diffusion and reaction between MgB2 and SUS-304 tube is found in the\nEPMA spectra. As shown in Fig. 1-(c) and (d), where the numbers are the counts of\neach element for the line profiles, however, there are a bit reacted traces with oxygen\ninto MgB2 core for both the composite ribbons. An impurity phase, such as a MgO,\nmight be generated inside the superconductor MgB2 core during fabrication.\nFor the resistivity (\u03c1) and the transport critical current (I c) measurements, we cut\nsegments of both sintered and non-sintered composite MgB2 /SUS ribbons with the\nlength of 4 ~ 5 cm long.\n\nTheir characteristic curves, R(T) as well as V(I), were\n\n4\n\n\fmeasured by using a standard dc four-probe method.\n\nThe normalized resistivity curves\n\nshown in Fig. 2 for both prototype composite ribbons were obtained with directly\nsoldered voltage contacts separated by the distance of ~ 10 mm, using a 30 mA current.\nThe normalized resistivity curves at self field, measured over a wide temperature range\nfrom 300 to 10 K, show a sharp superconducting transition at Tc (onset) = 38.5 K and 36\nK for the sintered and the non-sintered one, respectively. The sintered one was found\nto slightly increase the Tc as compared to the non-sintered one that exhibited about 2.5\nK lower Tc.\n\nThe non-sintered one, however, presents much sharper transition and\n\nhigher Tc than those of the pellet type sample, that was pressed with 3 GPa without any\nheat treatment, of commercially available MgB2 powder.11\n\nThe transport critical\n\ncurrent of the non-sintered composite MgB2 /SUS ribbon was obtained from V(I) curve,\nemploying AR4800 (32-channel, Yokogawa), with directly soldered voltage contacts\nseparated by the distance of ~ 10 mm, by sweeping the current of up to ~ 400 amperes.\nOn determining Ic with the ~ 1 \u03bcV/cm criterion, we have taken care of the superimposed\nvoltages of the superconductor MgB2 core and the clad SUS-304. As shown in Fig. 3,\ntransport critical currents Ic ~ 316 A at T = 4.2 K and ~ 82 A at 20 K were measured at\nself-field for the\n\nnon-sintered composite\n\nMgB2 /SUS ribbon.\n\nBy using a\n\nsuperconductor MgB2 core cross section areas of ~ 1.13 mm2 , we can estimated the\ntransport critical current densities of ~ 2.8 \u00d7 104 and of ~ 7.3 \u00d7 103 A/cm2 at 4.2 K and\n20 K, respectively.\n\nIn addition, we measured the field dependence of Ic for the non-\n\nsintered one at T = 4.2 K, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. All of data followed an\nexponential fall of Ic with H, except H = 3 T. The deviation at H = 3 T seems to be due\nto shielding effect of the clad SUS.\n\nIt, however, is hard to compare directly the\n\ntransport critical current of both the sintered and the non-sintered composite MgB2 /SUS\n\n5\n\n\fribbons.\n\nNot only, do they have different superconductor filling factors, but also\n\ndifferent reacted traces on the boundaries, shown in Fig. 1-(a) and -(b), between the core\nMgB2 and the clad SUS of the composites.\nFor magnetization study, we cut the ribbon into pieces with dimensions of about 0.5\n\u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.08 mm3 . Unfortunately, it was very hard to measure the superconductive\nmagnetization of the non-sintered composite MgB2 /SUS ribbon, because of the\nferromagnetism induced in the cladding by swaging and rolling. The ferromagnetic\nbehavior, however, faded and the SUS clad became less magnetic while sintering the\ncomposite MgB2 /SUS ribbons at 900o C for 1 hour. We, therefore, can measure and\nstudy the magnetization for the composite structures of the sintered composite\nMgB2 /SUS ribbon. Using a PPMS-9 (Quantum Design), the isothermal magnetization\nM(H) was measured at temperatures T between 5 and 50 K in magnetic fields up to 6 T.\nValues of magnetization M were corrected for the background M, measured above Tc.\nThe inset in Fig. 4 shows the zero-field-cooled curve for H perpendicular to platelet\nplane. Measurement of the low-field susceptibility \u03c7 in H = 10 G revealed Tc's of 38.5\nK for H perpendicular to the platelet plane. The persistent current density Jp was\nobtained from the irreversible magnetization using the Bean critical state model. The\nBean formula to estimate the persistent current density is Jp ~ 30 \u2206M/d with J in A/cm2 ,\nwhere \u2206\u039c is the difference of magnetization M between the increasing field and the\ndecreasing field branches, in units of emu/cm3 = G, and d is the transverse width of the\nsuperconductor core, in the sintered ribbon. Fig. 4 shows the persistent current density\nJp versus magnetic field H for each temperature. As shown in Fig. 4, Jp values were\nestimated to be more than ~ 7 \u00d7 105 A/cm2 at H = 0 T, and ~ 6 \u00d7 105 A/cm2 at 1 T, for\nthe sintered ribbon at T = 5 K.\n\nIn addition, Jp ~ 1.2 \u00d7 105 at H = 0 and ~ 2 \u00d7 104 at 1 T\n\n6\n\n\fwere estimated at 30 K.\nLet us recall the remarkable transport critical current (Ic ) for the non-sintered\ncomposite MgB2 /SUS ribbon, as an unexpected result. During the swaging and cold\nrolling processes, the superconductor core has suffered a deformation by high pressure\non every step, because of the hard clad SUS-304.\n\nThe composite MgB2 /SUS ribbons,\n\ntherefore, can maintain the fine MgB2 particles in intimate contact inside hard SUS-304\ntube on every swaging and rolling cycle than the starting MgB2 powder. In contrast\nwith the prominent weak-linkage between grains in high-Tc cuprate superconductors,\npolycrystalline forms of superconducting MgB2 have shown strongly linked current\nflow between misoriented grains, as observed by Larbalestier, et al..9\n\nTherefore, the\n\nfiner superconductor MgB2 , that has the striking feature of strong-linkage between\ngrains, might be a factor for vortex pinning enhancement. On the contrary, there is a\npossibility of some reaction between the MgB2 and the SUS-304 clad at high\ntemperature. So, some non-superconducting phases, such as MgO or others, could be\na barricade to current flow between grains.\n\nThe composite MgB2 /SUS ribbons,\n\nhowever, offer a positive vision of reaching much higher persistent critical densities, by\nbetter controlling of contamination and stabilizing of the superconductor during\nfabrication, of the composite MgB2 /SUS ribbons or other metal or non-metal\nclad/sheath MgB2 ribbons.\n\nThere are still large open areas to understand and to\n\nimprove the superconductivity for metal-clad MgB2 wires/ribbons.\nIn summary, we successfully have fabricated a single-filament composite\nMgB2 /SUS ribbon, as an ultra-robust conductor type, employed the powder-in-tube\n(PIT) process that was swaging and cold rolling only.\n\nIn addition, we report a\n\nremarkable transport critical current (I c) of the non-sintered composite MgB2 /SUS\n\n7\n\n\fribbon, as a striking result. The transport critical current Ic ~ 316 A at T = 4.2 K and I c\n~ 82 A at T = 20 K were observed at self-field, for the non-sintered one. Sharp\nsuperconducting transitions at Tc (onset) = 38.5 K and 36 K were observed from\nresistivity curves for the sintered and the non-sintered composites, respectively. The\nsintered composite was found to have a slightly higher Tc as compared to the nonsintered composite one that exhibited a Tc about 2.5 K lower. On the other hand, for\nthe sintered composite one, the persistent current density Jp values, that were estimated\nby Bean formula, were more than ~ 7 \u00d7 105 A/cm2 at H = 0 G, and ~ 6 \u00d7 105 A/cm2 at H\n= 1 T, at T = 5 K, respectively.\n\nAt 30 K, Jp ~ 1.2 \u00d7 105 at H = 0 G and Jp ~ 2 \u00d7 104 at 1\n\nT, as well. We are still optimizing the processes for forming single or multi-filament\ncomposite MgB2 /SUS ribbons.\n\nThe author (K. J. Song) wishes to acknowledge valuable discussions with J. R.\nThompson.
