Stellar dynamics-hydrodynamics, instabilities\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIt is striking to observe that self-gravitating systems follow a kind of organization despite the diversity of their initial conditions and their environment. This organization\nis illustrated by morphological classification schemes such\nas the Hubble sequence for galaxies and by simple rules\nwhich govern the structure of individual self-gravitating\nsystems. For example, elliptical galaxies display a quasiuniversal luminosity profile described by de Vaucouleur's\nR1/4 law and most of globular clusters are well-fitted by\nthe Michie-King model. On the other hand, the rotation\ncurves of spiral galaxies appear to be flat and this striking\nobservation can be explained by the presence of a dark\nmatter halo with a density profile decreasing as r\u22122 at\nlarge distances (Binney & Tremaine 1987).\n\nThe question that naturally emerges is what determines the particular configuration to which a selfgravitating system settles. It is possible that their actual configuration crucially depends on the conditions that\nprevail at their birth and on the details of their evolution. However, in view of their apparent regularity, it is\ntempting to investigate whether their organization can\nbe favoured by some fundamental physical principles like\nthose of thermodynamics and statistical physics. We ask\ntherefore if the actual states of self-gravitating systems\nare not simply more probable than any other possible configuration, i.e. if they cannot be considered as maximum\nentropy states (Chavanis 2002a).\nThis thermodynamical approach may be particularly\nrelevant for globular clusters and elliptical galaxies whose\ndistribution function is close to the isothermal one (at\nleast in the inner region of the system). In the case of\n\n\f2\n\nP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\nglobular clusters, the relaxation proceeds via two-body\nencounters and this \"collisional\" evolution is governed by\nthe Fokker-Planck-Landau kinetic equation for which a\nH-theorem is available (see Kandrup 1981 for a precise\ndiscussion). This collisional evolution can lead to the establishment of a statistical equilibrium state. This equilibrium state is usually described by the Michie-King model,\na truncated isothermal, which takes into account the escape of high energy stars due to tidal forces (Michie 1963,\nKing 1966). In fact, such equilibria are only metastable\n(Antonov 1962) and the evolution continues for longer\ntimes with the formation of binaries (H\u00e9non 1961). By\ncontrast, for elliptical galaxies, two-body encounters are\ncompletely negligible (the corresponding relaxation time\ntcoll exceeds the age of the universe by many orders\nof magnitude) and the galaxy dynamics is described by\nthe Vlasov equation, i.e. collisionless Boltzmann equation.\nYet, collisionless stellar systems can reach a metaequilibrium state as a result of a violent relaxation (Lynden-Bell\n1967). The statistical prediction of this metaequilibrium\nstate is complicated and depends on the initial conditions (Lynden-Bell 1967, Chavanis 2003a). Furthermore,\nthe metaequilibrium state actually reached by the system may differ from the statistical prediction due to incomplete relaxation. Therefore, H-functions must be constructed to account for the structure of elliptical galaxies\n(Tremaine, H\u00e9non & Lynden-Bell 1987, Hjorth & Madsen\n1993, Chavanis 2003a,c).\nThe thermodynamics of self-gravitating systems\nstarted with the discoveries by Emden (1907), Bonnor\n(1956) and Antonov (1962) that a self-gravitating isothermal gas can be in hydrostatic equilibrium only in a limited\nrange of thermodynamical parameters (energy, temperature and external pressure). Outside this range, the thermodynamical potential (entropy, free energy or Gibbs energy) has no extremum and the system is expected to collapse under its own gravity (Lynden-Bell & Wood 1968).\nA \"core-halo\" phase halting the collapse can be evidenced\nif we introduce appropriate small-scale cut-offs. Different\nregularizations have been proposed such as quantum degeneracy, hard spheres, soften potential,... Then, the shape\nof the caloric curve T (E) depends on an additional parameter \u03bc related to the inverse of the small-scale cut-off (see\nChavanis 2002b). For \u03bc \u2192 +\u221e, one recovers the classical\nresults of Emden, Bonnor and Antonov. As the cut-off increases, it is possible to describe phase transitions between\na \"gaseous\" phase (independent on the small-scale cut-off)\nand a \"condensed\" phase with a core-halo structure. It is\nimportant to stress that statistical ensembles are not interchangeable for self-gravitating systems (Thirring 1970,\nLynden-Bell & Lynden-Bell 1977, Padmanabhan 1990)\nand that phase transitions occur not only in the canonical ensemble but also in the microcanonical ensemble if\nthe cut-off is sufficiently small (Stahl et al. 1994, Chavanis\n2002b, Chavanis & Ispolatov 2002). Microcanonical phase\ntransitions are a rather new phenomenon associated with\nthe existence of metastable states (local entropy maxima).\n\nIn the previous studies, the system is supposed to\nbe non-rotating. The thermodynamics of rotating stellar\nsystems was studied by Lagoute & Longaretti (1996) in\nthe framework of Michie-King models describing globular clusters. The case of a slowly rotating isothermal gas\nconfined within a spherical box was treated by Chavanis\n(2002c) using analytical methods introduced by Milne\n(1923) and Chandrasekhar (1933) for distorted polytropes. Recently, Fliegans & Gross (2002) and Votyakov\net al. (2002) have considered the statistical mechanics of\na rapidly rotating self-gravitating gas in relation with the\nprocess of star formation. They showed that phase transitions from axisymmetric to non-axisymmetric structures\n(\"double stars\") occur at sufficiently high values of angular momentum. These authors provide an interesting\nphase diagram of rotating self-gravitating systems for arbitrary values of angular momentum and energy. They\ntreat the particles as hard spheres (of size a) and consider a relatively large value of the small-scale cut-off.\nFliegans & Gross (2002) evaluate the density of state\ng(E, L) numerically for a finite number N of particles\nin two-dimensions. Votyakov et al. (2002) use a meanfield approximation N \u226b 1 and adopt a distribution\n\u03c1(\u03a6) corresponding to a Fermi-Dirac statistics in configuration space. This model is expected to take into account\nhard sphere effects, where the hard spheres are introduced\nheuristically to fix an upper limit to the local density.\nIn this paper, we shall study the structure of rotating\nself-gravitating systems described by a Fermi-Dirac distribution function f = f (\u01eb) in phase space. This is the usual\ndistribution function of quantum particles (fermions) due\nto Pauli's exclusion principle. This distribution function\ndescribes electrons in white dwarf stars (Chandrasekhar\n1942), neutrons in neutron stars (Hertel & Thirring 1971)\nand massive neutrinos in dark matter models (Bilic &\nViollier 1997). Incidentally, this distribution function also\noccurs in the context of the violent relaxation of collisionless stellar systems (Chavanis & Sommeria 1998). In the\nlatter, the statistical approach refers to a coarse-graining\nof the distribution function and the effective exclusion\nprinciple is a consequence of the Liouville theorem associated with the collisionless nature of the evolution (LyndenBell 1967, Chavanis 2002d).\nThe distinction between the distribution used by\nVotyakov et al. (2002) and the ordinary Fermi-Dirac distribution function in phase space is crucial, regarding the\nstructure of the condensed phase, when the system is rotating. At T = 0 (or E = Emin ), the former leads to\na homogeneous body (\u03c1 = Cst.) while the latter leads\nto a polytrope with index n = 3/2 corresponding to a\nclassical white dwarf star (p = K\u03c15/3 ). Now, it is wellknown that a uniformly rotating homogeneous mass is\naxisymmetric (spheroidal) for slow rotations (Maclaurin\nsequence) but bifurcates to non-axisymmetric configurations at sufficiently high rotations (Chandrasekhar 1969).\nThese non-axisymmetric structures are usually ellipsoidal\n(Jacobi sequence) but more complex structures (pearshaped, dumbbell,...) have also been found. The fission of\n\n\fP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\nthe self-gravitating fluid into a binary state is also possible\n(Hachisu & Eriguchi 1984) and these binary states appear\nin the study of Votyakov et al. (2002) at low temperatures\nand high rotations. On general grounds, the fission instability has been extensively discussed in relation with the\nformation of binary stars and the formation of the moon\n(in the non-symmetrical case). However, the fission scenario may not be the relevant mechanism and it is almost\nabandoned at present. Binary stars are more likely to result from the fragmentation of the molecular cloud (Boss\n1988) and the moon has probably been detached from\nthe protoearth after a collision with a Mars-sized body\n(Boss 1986). In contrast to incompressible fluid masses, a\npolytropic configuration with index n > 0.808 does not\nbifurcate to non-axisymmetric structures when angular\nvelocity is increased; it remains axisymmetric until the\nKeplerian limit is reached (James 1964). At that point\nthere is mass shedding at the equator (with the formation\nof a cusp) and disruption of the system. This concerns\nin particular polytropes of index n = 3/2 (white dwarfs)\nwhich are the zero temperature limit of the Fermi distribution (Fowler 1926). This picture probably persists at\nfinite temperature where we have, typically, a Fermi condensate surrounded by a \"vapour\". Therefore, the phase\ndiagram corresponding to the Fermi-Dirac statistics in\nphase space is expected to differ from the one calculated\nby Votyakov et al. (2002). In this paper, we propose to\ncompute this phase diagram for arbitrary rotation and degeneracy parameter (or system size) in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We shall restrict ourselves\nto axisymmetric single-cluster configurations because our\ncode is limited to such configurations. According to James'\nresult, if other structures exist (double-clusters, rings,...),\nthey should bifurcate discontinuously from the spheroidal\nsequence as rotation increases. Such bifurcations will not\nbe considered in this paper. The present study completes the description of non-rotating or slowly rotating\nfermionic structures discussed by Chavanis (2002b,c).\n\n2.

Let\nf (r, v, t) denote the distribution function of the system,\ni.e. f (r, v, t)d3 rd3 v gives the mass of particles whose position and velocity are in the cell (r, v; r + d3 r, v + d3 v) at\ntime t. The integral of f over the velocity determines the\nspatial density\nZ\n\u03c1 = f d3 v.\n(1)\nThe mass and angular momentum of the configuration are\ngiven by\nZ\nM = \u03c1d3 r,\n(2)\n\nL=\n\nZ\n\nf r\u00d7v d3 rd3 v.\n\n3\n\n(3)\n\nOn the other hand, in the mean-field approximation, the\nenergy can be expressed as\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n2 3 3\nf v d rd v +\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r = K + W,\n(4)\nE=\n2\n2\nwhere K is the kinetic energy and W the potential energy.\nThe gravitational potential \u03a6 is related to the density by\nthe Newton-Poisson equation\n\u2206\u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1.\n\n(5)\n\nLet us consider different systems of astrophysical interest that can be approached by statistical mechanics. (i)\nThe equilibrium states of collisional stellar systems (e.g.,\nglobular clusters), reached for t > trelax \u223c lnNN tD (where\ntD is the dynamical time), are obtained by maximizing the\nBoltzmann entropy (Antonov 1962, Ogorodnikov 1965,\nLynden-Bell & Wood 1968)\nZ\nS = \u2212 f ln f d3 rd3 v,\n(6)\nat fixed mass M , energy E and angular momentum L.\nThis is a condition of thermodynamical stability for the\nHamiltonian N-stars system. For globular systems, only\nthe microcanonical ensemble makes sense and equilibrium\nstates exist only above the Antonov energy. Furthermore,\nthese equilibria are only metastable (but long-lived) since\nthe Boltzmann entropy has no global maximum. (ii)\nCollisionless stellar systems (e.g. elliptical galaxies) can\nreach a metaequilibrium state on a very short time scale\n\u223c tD as a result of a violent relaxation. This metaequilibrium state is a stationary solution of the Vlasov equation. Lynden-Bell (1967) has tried to predict this metaequilibrium state by resorting to a new type of statistical\nmechanics. Unfortunately, his prediction is limited by the\nproblem of incomplete relaxation (e.g., Hjorth & Madsen\n1993). Therefore, H-functions must be introduced to account for the structure of galaxies (Tremaine, H\u00e9non &\nLynden-Bell 1987, Chavanis 2003a,c). It can be shown that\nthe maximization of a H-function\nZ\nS = \u2212 C(f )d3 rd3 v,\n(7)\nat fixed M , E and L, where C(f ) is a convex function (i.e. C \u2032\u2032 (f ) > 0) determines nonlinearly dynamically\nstable stationary solutions of the Vlasov equation (Ipser\n& Horwitz 1979). This is similar to a condition of microcanonical stability in thermodynamics where S plays\nthe role of a generalized entropy (Chavanis 2003a). Note\nthat according to the Jeans theorem (Binney & Tremaine\n1987), other solutions of the Vlasov equation can be constructed which do not satisfy this criterion. (iii) The equilibrium properties of stars are obtained by coupling the\nhydrostatic equations to a local equation of state. In simplest models, it is assumed that the star is barotropic, i.e.\n\n\f4\n\nP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\np = p(\u03c1). We introduce the energy functional\nZ Z \u03c1\nZ\np(\u03c1\u2032 ) \u2032 3\n1\nW[\u03c1] = \u03c1\nd\u03c1 d r +\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r\n\u03c1\u20322\n2\n0\nZ\nZ\nu2 3\n+ \u03c1 d r \u2212 \u03a9 \u03c1 r \u00d7 u d3 r,\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the first term is the internal energy, the second the\ngravitational energy, the third the kinetic energy of the\nbulk motion and the third the energy of rotation. It can\nbe shown that the minimization of W[\u03c1] at fixed mass M\nand angular velocity \u03a9 determines nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solutions of the Euler-Jeans equations. This is similar to a condition of canonical stability in\nthermodynamics where W plays the role of a generalized\nfree energy (Chavanis 2003a). (iv) Finally, the interstellar\nmedium can be considered as a gas in thermal equilibrium with a radiation background (de Vega & Sanchez\n2002). Therefore, for this system, the canonical description makes sense. The stability of the gas against gravitational collapse can be studied thermodynamically by\nminimizing the free energy F = E \u2212 T S associated with\nthe Boltzmann entropy (6) or dynamically by using the\nJeans instability criterion (see Chavanis 2002e). This is\nthe traditional approach to understand star formation.\nIn this paper, we shall consider a system of selfgravitating fermions. They can be electrons in white dwarf\nstars, neutrons in neutron stars or massive neutrinos in\ndark matter models. Their statistical equilibrium state is\nobtained by maximizing the Fermi-Dirac entropy\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\nZ \u001a\nf\nf\nf\nf\nS=\u2212\nln 1 \u2212\nd3 rd3 v, (9)\nln\n+ 1\u2212\n\u03b70 \u03b70\n\u03b70\n\u03b70\nat fixed mass, energy and angular momentum. In this formula \u03b70 = (2s + 1)m4 /(2\u03c0h\u0304)3 is the maximum allowable\nvalue of the distribution function fixed by Pauli's exclusion principle (s is the spin). For the quantum gas, we\nshall consider either microcanonical or canonical equilibria. Incidentally, the Fermi-Dirac entropy (9) also occurs\nin the statistical theory of violent relaxation for collisionless stellar systems developed by Lynden-Bell (1967). It\ncorresponds to the two-levels approximation f0 \u2208 {0, \u03b70 }\nof his theory, where f0 is the initial distribution function (Chavanis & Sommeria 1998). In the non degenerate\nlimit f \u226a \u03b70 , the Fermi-Dirac distribution (9) returns the\nBoltzmann entropy (6) as a special case. Therefore, our\nstudy can apply either to quantum particles, stellar systems or to the interstellar medium. Of course, each system\ncorresponds to a different limit of the theory characterized\nby a different degree of degeneracy and rotation.\nLooking for critical points of entropy (9) at fixed mass,\nenergy and angular momentum and introducing Lagrange\nmultipliers \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u2212\u03b2\u03a9 for each constraint, we obtain\nthe Fermi-Dirac distribution function\n\u03b70\n,\n(10)\nf=\n1 + \u03bbe\u03b2(\u01eb\u2212\u03a9*j)\n2\n\nwhere \u01eb = v2 + \u03a6 and j = r\u00d7v are the energy and the angular momentum of a particle by unit of mass and \u03b2 = 1/T\n\nis the inverse temperature (we include m or \u03b70 in the definition of T ). The same distribution (10) is obtained by\nextremizing the free energy J = S \u2212\u03b2E +\u03b2\u03a9*L at fixed \u03b2,\n\u03a9 and M . However, the second order variations of S and J\n(under respective constraints) can have a different sign implying an inequivalence of statistical ensembles (Chavanis\n2003c). Introducing the Jacobi energy \u01ebJ \u2261 \u01eb \u2212 \u03a9 * j and\n2\nnoting that \u01ebJ = w2 + \u03a6ef f , where w = v \u2212 \u03a9\u00d7r is the\nrelative velocity and \u03a6ef f = \u03a6 \u2212 21 (\u03a9\u00d7r)2 is the effective\npotential accounting for inertial forces, we can rewrite Eq.\n(10) in the form\n\u03b70\n.\n(11)\nf=\nw2\n1 + \u03bbe\u03b2( 2 +\u03a6ef f )\nWe note that the \"most probable\" form of rotation is a\nrigid rotation \u03a9. The gravitational potential \u03a6 is defined\nwithin an arbitrary gauge constant. We shall take the ordinary convention \u03a6 \u2192 0 at infinity.\nBy integrating Eq. (11) over the velocity, we find that\nthe density is given by\n\u221a\n4\u03c0 2\u03b70\nI1/2 (\u03bbe\u03b2\u03a6ef f ),\n(12)\n\u03c1=\n\u03b2 3/2\nwhere In is the Fermi integral\nZ +\u221e\nxn\ndx.\nIn (t) =\n1 + tex\n0\n\n(13)\n\nThe equilibrium configuration is then obtained by solving\nthe Fermi-Poisson equation\n\u221a\n16\u03c0 2 2G\u03b70\n\u2206\u03a6 =\nI1/2 (\u03bbe\u03b2\u03a6ef f ),\n(14)\n\u03b2 3/2\nand relating the Lagrange multipliers \u03bb, \u03b2 and \u03a9 to the\nconstraints M , E and L. We stress that, for long-range\nsystems, the mean-field approximation is exact in a suitable thermodynamic limit (see Sec. 2.4) so that our \"thermodynamical\" approach based on the maximization of\nthermodynamical potentials is rigorous and simpler than\nthe \"statistical\" approach based on functional integration\n(Laliena 1999, Votyakov et al. 2002). The relation between\nthe two points of view is discussed in Chavanis (2003a).\n\n2.2. The box model\nIt is easy to see that Eq. (14) has no physical solution.\nIndeed, the density decreases as r\u22122 at large distances\nso that the total mass of the configuration is infinite in\ncontradiction with our starting hypothesis. This means\nthat there is no maximum entropy state in an unbounded\ndomain. A self-gravitating system at non-zero temperature has the tendency to \"evaporate\". Therefore, the\nstatistical mechanics of self-gravitating systems (classical\nor quantum) is essentially an out-of-equilibrium problem.\nHowever, evaporation is a slow process and, in practice,\nthe system is found in a quasi-equilibrium state with a\n\"core-halo\" structure. The core of the system is approximately isothermal while the halo departs from isothermality. Therefore, the distribution function (10) must be\n\n\fP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\nmodified at high energies. Some modified isothermal distributions have been introduced in the case of globular\nclusters (Michie 1963, King 1966) subject to the tides of\na nearby object (typically a spiral galaxy) and in the case\nof elliptical galaxies undergoing incomplete violent relaxation (Hjorth & Madsen 1993).\nAnother astrophysically plausible distribution function\nwhich takes into account Pauli's exclusion principle and\ntidal effects is given by (Chavanis 1998)\ne\u2212\u03b2\u01eb \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u01ebm\nf = \u03b70\n,\n\u03bb + e\u2212\u03b2\u01eb\n\n(15)\n\nfor \u01eb \u2264 \u01ebm and f = 0 for \u01eb \u2265 \u01ebm (where \u01ebm is the escape\nenergy). This distribution function can be derived from\na Fokker-Planck equation appropriate to self-gravitating\nfermions. It can describe dark matter halos limited in extension by tidal effects (and, possibly, certain collisionless\nstellar systems). In the classical limit, it reduces to the\nMichie-King model. The distribution function (15) will be\nstudied specifically in another paper. For the present, we\nshall keep the full Fermi-Dirac distribution function (11)\nand confine the system within a spherical box of radius\nR so as to avoid the infinite mass problem while preserving the rotational symmetry of the system. Typically, the\nsize of the box delimitates the physical extent of the system under consideration. Putting the system in a box is a\nsimple and crude way of handling the infinite mass problem. This is sufficient, in a first step, if we are just interested in describing phase transitions between gaseous\nand \"core-halo\" states. If, on the other hand, we wish to\nmake more realistic models of self-gravitating systems, the\nspatial confinement must be given further consideration.\n\n2.3. Asymptotic limits T = 0 and T \u2192 +\u221e\nIt will be convenient in the following to work with dimensionless variables defined by\n\u03a6\n,\n(GM/R)\n\u0012 3 \u00131/2\n\u03b2GM\nR\nER\n\u2032\n,\n, \u03b7=\n, \u03a9 =\u03a9\n\u039b=\u2212\nGM 2\nR\nGM\n\u221a\nL\n, \u03bc = \u03b70 512\u03c0 4 G3 M R3 .\nL\u2032 = \u221a\nGM 3 R\nx=\n\nr\n,\nR\n\nn=\n\n\u03c1\n,\n(M/R3 )\n\n\u03c6=\n\n(16)\n\nThis is equivalent to setting M = R = G = 1 in the\ndimensional equations and we shall adopt this convention\nin the following.\nThen, the degeneracy parameter is \u221a\ngiven\n\u221a\nby \u03bc = 16 2\u03c0 2 \u03b70 . We also define \u03c8 = \u03b2\u03a6 and \u03c9 = \u03b2\u03a9.\nDenoting by \u03c80 the value of \u03c8 at r = 0 and introducing\nthe uniformizing variable k = \u03bbe\u03c80 , the Fermi-Poisson\nequation (14) becomes\n\u221a\n1 2 2\u0001\n(17)\n\u2206\u03c8 = \u03bc T I1/2 ke\u03c8\u2212\u03c80 \u2212 2 \u03c9 s ,\nwhere s = r sin \u03b8 denotes the distance to the axis of rotation. Equation (17) must be solved with the condition\n\u03c8 \u2192 0 at infinity. Before solving this equation in the general case, we first discuss important asymptotic limits.\n\n5\n\nFor k \u2192 +\u221e, we can use the limiting form of the Fermi\nintegral\nIn (t) \u223c\n\n1\n\u0393(n + 1),\nt\n\n(t \u2192 +\u221e),\n\nand we obtain the Boltzmann-Poisson equation\n\u221a\n\u03bc \u03c0T \u2212\u03c8+\u03c80 + 1 \u03c92 s2\n2\n,\n\u2206\u03c8 =\ne\n2k\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nfor a rotating isothermal gas. This corresponds to the high\ntemperature limit of the Fermi distribution. Indeed, for\nT \u226b 1 the distribution function (11) is Maxwellian\nf=\n\n\u03b70 \u2212\u03b2( w2 +\u03a6ef f )\n2\n.\ne\n\u03bb\n\n(20)\n\nAlternatively, for k \u2192 0, we can use the limiting form of\nthe Fermi integral\nIn (t) \u223c\n\n(\u2212 ln t)n+1\n,\nn+1\n\n(t \u2192 0),\n\nand obtain the Lane-Emden equation\n\u00013/2\n2 \u221a\n1\n,\n\u2206\u03c8 = \u03bc T \u2212 ln k \u2212 \u03c8 + \u03c80 + \u03c9 2 s2\n3\n2\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nfor a rotating polytrope of index n = 3/2. This corresponds to the low temperature limit of the Fermi distribution in which the structure is completely degenerate\n(white dwarf). Indeed, for T = 0, the distribution function (11) is a step function\nf = \u03b70 H(\u01ebJ \u2212 \u01ebF ),\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u01ebJ is the Jacobi energy, \u01ebF = \u2212(1/\u03b2) ln \u03bb is the\nFermi energy and H is the Heaviside function. Therefore,\nthe Fermi-Dirac distribution function connects continuously isothermal and polytropic distributions for high and\nlow temperatures.\nWe recall that for the self-gravitating Fermi gas at T =\n0 (white dwarf), the density vanishes at a finite radius R\u2217 .\nThe mass-radius relation can be written (Chandrasekhar\n1942)\n\u03c7\n(24)\nM R\u22173 = 2 3 ,\n\u03b70 G\nwith \u03c7 \u2243 5.9723 10\u22123 . The condition R\u2217 \u2264 R is equivalent\nto\np\n\u03bc \u2265 \u03bc\u2217 \u2261 512\u03c0 4 \u03c7 \u2243 17.259.\n(25)\nMore generally, we have\n\u0012 \u00133/2\nR\n.\n\u03bc = \u03bc\u2217\nR\u2217\n\n(26)\n\nTherefore, the degeneracy parameter \u03bc is related to the\nratio of the system size R to the radius R\u2217 of a white\ndwarf star with mass M . Accordingly, a small value of \u03bc\ncorresponds to a large \"effective\" cut-off (played by Pauli's\nexclusion principle) or, equivalently, to a small system size.\nAlternatively, a large value of \u03bc corresponds to a small\n\"effective\" cut-off or a large system size.\n\n\f6\n\nP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\n2.4. The thermodynamic limit\nBefore going further, we shall discuss the thermodynamic\nlimit of self-gravitating systems. In order to precisely define the thermodynamic limit, we must introduce a smallscale regularization otherwise the density of states g(E)\ndiverges (Padmanabhan 1990). The most physical regularization is to consider quantum mechanics effects. Indeed,\ncompact objects such as white dwarf stars and neutron\nstars owe their stability to quantum mechanics. The thermodynamic limit corresponds to N \u2192 +\u221e such that \u039b =\n2 2\n\u2032\n\u2212ER/GN\n\u03a9(R3 /GN m)1/2 ,\n\u221a m , \u03b7 = \u03b2GN m/R, \u03a9 = \u221a\n\u2032\n4\n3\nL = L/ GN 3 m3 R and \u03bc = (gm /h ) 512\u03c0 4 G3 N mR3\nare kept fixed. It is natural to fix m, h and G. Then, the\nstrict thermodynamic limit is N \u2192 +\u221e with\nR \u223c N \u22121/3 , E \u223c N 7/3 ,\n\u03a9 \u223c N, L \u223c N 4/3 .\n\n\u03b2 \u223c N \u22124/3 ,\n\n(27)\n\nThis scaling was indicated in a previous paper (Chavanis\n2002b). When this limit is taken, S \u223c N , J \u223c N and the\nmean-field approximation is exact (note that the usual free\nenergy F = E \u2212 T S = \u2212J/\u03b2 scales as N 7/3 ). The scaling\nM R3 \u223c 1 corresponds to the \"white dwarf\" mass-radius\nrelation (24). The fact that R \u2192 0 as N \u2192 +\u221e accounts\nfor the natural tendency of self-gravitating systems to collapse (note that when M reaches Chandrasekhar's limiting\nmass, Newtonian mechanics loses its relevance). We shall\ncall (27) the quantum, or white dwarf, thermodynamical\nlimit (QTL). It is particularly relevant for compact objects\nforming the condensed phase.\nIf we now consider the classical limit h = 0, we see that\n\u03bc becomes infinite so that it disappears from the problem.\nThen, the classical thermodynamic limit (CTL) is N \u2192\n2 2\n+\u221e with fixed \u039b = \u2212ER/GN\nm , \u03b7 = \u03b2GN m/R, \u03a9\u2032 =\n\u221a\n3\n1/2\n\u2032\n\u03a9(R /GN m) , L = L/ GN 3 m3 R. We note that there\nis a freedom since we have to fix a parameter in order to\ndetermine the others. If we assume \u03b2 \u223c 1, the classical\nthermodynamic limit is N \u2192 +\u221e with\nR \u223c N,\n\n\u03a9\u223cN\n\nE \u223c N,\n\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n\u03b2 \u223c 1,\n\nL \u223c N 2.\n\n(28)\n\nThis has been called the \"dilute limit\" by de Vega &\nSanchez (2002). Again, S \u223c N , J \u223c N (and now F \u223c N )\nso that the mean-field approximation is exact in that\nlimit. We recall that for h = 0, the density of state diverges due to the existence of collapsed configurations.\nHowever, for sufficiently large T and E/N , we know that\nthere exists long-lived metastable gaseous states (local entropy maxima). For N \u226b 1, these metastable states have\na very long lifetime, increasing as exp(N ), so they constitute the most relevant astrophysical structures (Katz\n& Okamoto 2000, Chavanis & Ispolatov 2002, Chavanis\n2003a). Globular clusters are in such metastable states.\nThese gaseous states are independent on the small-scale\ncut-off so they are described adequately by the dilute limit\n(28). The consideration of these metastable states may\nsolve the problems raised by Laliena (2003). Collapsed\n\nconfigurations (binaries in MCE and Dirac peaks in CE),\nwhich correspond to global maxima of entropy or free energy (i.e., true equilibrium states) must be discarded \"by\nhands\" because they are reached for unphysically large\ntimes t \u2192 +\u221e. They can be reached for accessible times\nonly if the temperature and the energy are sufficiently\nsmall (T < Tc or E < Ec ) because, in that case, the\ngaseous phase ceases to exist and the system undergoes\ngravitational collapse. Clearly, the end-state of the collapse depends on the nature of the small-scale cut-off (e.g.,\nquantum degeneracy) and we must consider the thermodynamical limit (27) if we want to describe these condensed states.\nIf instead of fermions we consider a hard sphere gas,\nthe filling factor is \u03bc = R/aN 1/3 where a is the hard\nsphere radius (see Chavanis 2002). Then, fixing a, m and\nG, the strict thermodynamic limit is N \u2192 +\u221e with\nR \u223c N 1/3 , E \u223c N 5/3 ,\n\u03a9 \u223c 1, L \u223c N 5/3 .\n\n\u03b2 \u223c N \u22122/3 ,\n\n(29)\n\nFinally, if we consider a soften potential with soften\nparameter r0 , the cut-off parameter is \u03bc = R/r0 (see\nChavanis & Ispolatov 2002). Then, fixing r0 , m and G,\nthe strict thermodynamic limit is N \u2192 +\u221e with\nR \u223c 1, E \u223c N 2 , \u03b2 \u223c N \u22121 ,\n\u03a9 \u223c N 1/2 L \u223c N 3/2 .\n\n(30)\n\nThe dilute limit (28) is of course unchanged and it describes gaseous metastable states independent on the\nsmall-scale cut-off. Note that other combinations keeping\n\u039b, \u03b7, \u03a9\u2032 and L\u2032 fixed can be considered (e.g., G \u223c 1/N for\nfixed m, R, \u03b2, E/N , \u03a9 and L/N or m \u223c 1/N for fixed G,\nR, \u03b2, E, \u03a9 and L). Of course, the limits considered above\nare only formal. In reality, one does not have to make N ,\nR,... go to +\u221e or 0. The precise values taken by these\nparameters are fixed by the physics of the system under\nconsideration (molecular clouds, globular clusters, white\ndwarfs, neutron stars, dark matter halos,...). Note that\neven for small values of N , the mean-field approximation\nis accurate so that the thermodynamic limit makes sense\neven if we are not in the strict, mathematical, conditions\nof its application.\n\n2.5. Integral constraints\nAccording to the classical work of James (1964), rotating polytropes with index n > 0.808 do not bifurcate to\nnon-axisymmetric structures when rotation is increased.\nInstead, they develop a cusp at the equator. Since the\nFermi gas at T = 0 is equivalent to a polytrope of index n = 3/2, it is not expected to bifurcate to nonaxisymmetric structures (in contrast to homogeneous bodies). We expect this property to persist at non-zero temperature since, at T 6= 0, we have essentially a polytrope 3/2 surrounded by a dilute halo. We do not exclude the possibility of discontinuous bifurcations to nonaxisymmetric structures or rings. However, in this paper,\n\n\fP.H. Chavanis and M.

(17) depends only on three parameters \u03bc,\n\u03a9 and k. The degeneracy parameter \u03bc and the angular\nvelocity \u03a9 specify a series of equilibria parameterized by\nthe uniformizing variable k. Given these three parameters, the Fermi-Poisson equation (17) can be solved by an\niterative procedure. For that purpose, the radial components of the potential, i.e. \u03c8lm (r), are discretized on the\n\n7\n\nGauss-Lobatto grid which ensures spectral convergence.\nTypically, the resolution used for the following numerical\nresults was 100 radial grid points and a decomposition on\n16 spherical harmonics.\nThe temperature T (\u03bc, \u03a9, k), the energy E(\u03bc, \u03a9, k) and\nthe angular momentum L(\u03bc, \u03a9, k) are determined by Eqs.\n(39), (32) and (31). It is then possible to compute the\ncaloric curves E(T ) for given \u03bc and \u03a9 (or L) by eliminating\nk from the previous relations.\n\n3. Caloric curves for low values of the degeneracy\nparameter (high cut-off/small system)\nWe first describe the figures of equilibrium of the rotating self-gravitating Fermi gas for a degeneracy parameter\n\u03bc = 100. This value is smaller than the microcanonical\ncritical point \u03bcMT P = 2670 above which a first order microcanonical phase transition appears (Chavanis 2002b).\nHence, for \u03bc = 100 (small system), the influence of the\nsmall-scale cut-off (played here by the exclusion principle) is strong in average and stabilizes the system with\nrespect to the gravothermal catastrophe (Lynden-Bell &\nWood 1968).\n\n3.1. Non-rotating configurations\nThe caloric curve of non-rotating self-gravitating fermions\nhas been discussed by Chavanis (2002b) in both canonical\nand microcanonical ensembles and for arbitrary values of\nthe degeneracy parameter \u03bc (or system size R). This completes the work of Hertel & Thirring (1971) who worked in\ncanonical ensemble and considered small system sizes. For\nnon-rotating systems, the results obtained with fermions\nare similar to those obtained with other small-scale regularizations, the small-scale cut-off playing the same role as\nthe inverse of the degeneracy parameter (Stahl et al. 1994,\nFollana & Laliena 2000, Chavanis & Ispolatov 2002).\nWe first discuss the microcanonical ensemble corresponding to an isolated system with fixed energy. For\n\u03bc < \u03bcMT P = 2670, there exists only one extremum of\nentropy for each energy and it is a global entropy maximum (GEM). The caloric curve is plotted in Fig. 1 (in\nthis figure \u03bc = 1000). For high energies, the density is\nalmost homogeneous (Fig. 2g). This forms the \"gaseous\"\nphase. For energies close to the minimum accessible energy Emin = \u22126.42 10\u22122 \u03bc2/3 (ground state), the temperature goes to zero and the system is completely degenerate (Fig. 2a). It has the same structure as a classical\nwhite dwarf star, i.e. a polytrope of index n = 3/2. This\nforms the \"condensed\" phase. For intermediate energies\n(Econd < E < Egas ), corresponding to the region of negative specific heats C = dE/dT < 0, the system has a\n\"core-halo\" structure with a degenerate nucleus (fermion\nball) and a dilute isothermal atmosphere (Fig. 2d) . This is\nlike a solid condensate embedded in a vapor in usual phase\ntransitions. This \"mixed phase\" is intermediate between\nthe pure condensed phase and the pure gaseous phase.\n\n\f8\n\nP.H.

The caloric curve for a non-rotating system with\n\u03bc = 1000 < \u03bcMT P = 2670. In the microcanonical ensemble (fixed E), the system slowly evolves from the gaseous\nphase to the condensed phase, passing by a mixed phase,\nas energy decreases. In the canonical ensemble (fixed T ),\nthe system undergoes a sharp phase transition at a critical temperature (see text). Below Tc , the gaseous states\nundergo a gravitational collapse (Jeans instability); above\nT\u2217 , the condensed states undergo an explosion. Between,\nTt and Tc (resp. T\u2217 ) the gaseous (resp. condensed) states\nare metastable. By varying the temperature of the system\nbetween T\u2217 and Tc (spinodal points), we can generate an\nhysteretic cycle between the gaseous and the condensed\nphase.\n\nWe now describe the canonical ensemble in which the\ntemperature T is fixed instead of the energy E. Thus, we\nneed to find maxima of free energy J = S \u2212 \u03b2E at fixed\n\u03b2 and M . We recall that, for an isolated self-gravitating\nsystem, the validity of using the canonical ensemble to describe the statistics of a sub-system cannot be established\nfrom the microcanonical ensemble since energy is not additive (Padmanabhan 1990). Therefore, the notion of thermostat has to be defined carefully. The canonical ensemble can make sense for self-gravitating systems subject to\nadditional short-range interactions. They can constitute\na thermostat imposing a temperature. In that case, the\nusual canonical ensemble interpretation holds. For example, a self-gravitating system in contact with a radiation\nbackground (e.g., a molecular cloud) is usually treated\nin the canonical ensemble. This is the traditional way of\nstudying stellar formation in relation with Jeans instability. Note that there exists a precise theoretical model\nwhere the canonical ensemble is rigorously justified. This\nis the self-gravitating Brownian gas model (Chavanis et\nal. 2002, Sire & Chavanis 2002, 2003). In this model, the\ntemperature has a precise physical interpretation since it\nis related to the strength of the stochastic force (\"kicks\")\nacting on the particles.\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, the region of negative specific heat is unstable as it corresponds to saddle points\n(SP) of free energy (Katz 1978, Chavanis & Sommeria\n1998). It is replaced by a canonical first order phase transition connecting the gaseous phase for T > Tt (\u03bc) to the\ncondensed phase for T < Tt (\u03bc). Therefore, the mixed\n\"core-halo\" states with C < 0 are thermodynamically forbidden in the canonical ensemble. The gaseous states with\ntemperature Tc < T < Tt are metastable (local maxima\nof free energy LFEM) but they are long-lived. They can\nplay an important role reminiscent of a supercooled state\nof the Van der Waals gas. At T < Tc they undergo a gravitational collapse (zeroth order phase transition) coinciding with Jeans instability criterion (Chavanis 2002e). For\nquantum particles, the outcome of this collapse is the formation of a \"fermion ball\" containing almost all the mass.\nIn the classical limit \u03bc \u2192 +\u221e, the isothermal collapse\nleads to a Dirac peak (see Sec. 5). The condensed states\nwith temperature Tt < T < T\u2217 are also metastable and\nlong-lived (if they are initially prepared in such states).\nThey will undergo an \"explosion\", reversed to the collapse, if they are heated above T\u2217 . This explosion transforms the dense core into a relatively uniform mass distribution. By varying the temperature between T\u2217 and Tc\nwe can generate an hysteretic cycle in the canonical ensemble. This hysteretic cycle was described qualitatively\nin Chavanis (2003b). Recently, it has been followed numerically by using a model of self-gravitating Brownian\nfermions (Chavanis et al. 2003). The turning points of\ntemperature where the metastable states terminate are\ncalled (canonical) spinodal points in the langage of phase\ntransition. The first order canonical phase transition disapears for \u03bc < \u03bcCT P = 83 (canonical critical point), i.e. for\nvery high cut-off values. This is simply because the smallscale \"repulsion\" prevails over gravity. More details on\nphase transitions in self-gravitating systems can be found\nin Chavanis (2002b).\n\n3.2. Slowly rotating configurations\nThe slowly rotating configurations of an isothermal gas\n(possibly degenerate) can be determined semi-analytically\nby using perturbative expansions of the BoltzmannPoisson or Fermi-Poisson equations in terms of the dimensionless rotation parameter v = \u03a92 /2\u03c0G\u03c10 (Chavanis\n2002c). To lowest order in the expansion, the effect of rotation is just to flatten the system and to shift the onset\nof instability (see Sec. 5). For T = 0 (or E = Emin ), we recover the distorted polytrope of index n = 3/2 studied by\nMilne (1923) and Chandrasekhar (1933). In the region of\nnegative specific heats, this \"rotating fermion ball\" is surrounded by a gaseous halo. For high energies, the system is\nnon degenerate. Hence, the description of the equilibrium\nphase diagram is very similar to that of the non-rotating\nFermi gas.\n\n\fP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\n9\n\nFig. 2. Plot of the density (logarithmic scale) in a meridional section of the box. The solid line marks the level where\ndensity is 0.05, the central density being unity. The first row shows configurations at very low temperature/energy\n(condensed phase). The second row shows configurations in the region of negative specific heats (mixed phase). Such\nstructures are forbidden (unstable) in the canonical ensemble. The third row shows configurations at high temperature/energy (gaseous phase). Alternatively, the first column corresponds to non-rotating systems, the second column\nto slowly rotating systems and the third column to systems rotating close to the Keplerian limit.\n\n3.3. Spheroidal structures\nFor higher values of rotation, the flattening increases and\nthe system takes a spheroidal structure. For E \u2192 Emin ,\nwe have a rapidly rotating \"fermion spheroid\" (Fig. 2b).\nThis structure is completely degenerate and highly concentrated. In particular, it is insensitive to the confining box. As energy increases further, the spheroid is only\npartially degenerate and extends to larger and larger distances (Fig. 2e). The rotation affects in priority the low\ndensity external region while the dense core of the configuration remains almost spherical. In the region of negative specific heats (Econd < E < Egas ), the \"spheroid\"\nis surrounded by a diffuse halo. This corresponds to a\n\nmixed phase. This \"spheroid-halo\" structure generalizes\nthe \"core-halo\" structure of non-rotating systems. For\neven larger values of energy, the spheroid would extend\noutside the box so that the system becomes almost onedimensional and depends only on the axial coordinate z\n(Fig. 2h). Note, however, that the density contrast is extremely low (R = \u03c1(0)/\u03c1(R) \u2243 1.00022) so that the structure is essentially homogeneous.\n\n3.4. Keplerian limit\nFor E = Emin , the temperature drops to zero and the system is equivalent to a pure polytrope with index n = 3/2.\nThe structure of rapidly rotating polytropes is well-known\n\n\f10\n\nP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\n(James 1964). For rigid polytropes with index n < 0.808,\nthe system is sensitive to non-axisymmetric instabilities\nof various forms. Therefore, at sufficiently high rotations,\nthe spheroidal sequence bifurcates continuously to more\ncomplicated structures (Chandrasekhar 1969). However,\nfor n > 0.808, non-axisymmetric instabilities are inhibited and the series of equilibria has a different evolution.\nThe polytrope develops a cusp at the equator at a point\nwhere the gravitational force balances the centrifugal force\n(Fig. 2c). This is the so-called Keplerian (or break-up)\nlimit corresponding to a critical angular velocity \u03a9max\nsuch that \u03a92max Re3 = GM , where Re is the equatorial radius. There is no equilibrium state for \u03a9 > \u03a9max as mass is\nejected from the equatorial surface by the centrifugal force\n(mass shedding). The tendency to expulse some mass far\naway may be related to the formation of a Keplerian disk\nabove \u03a9max . In that case, we must allow for differential\nrotation. Mathematically, above \u03a9max , the maximization\nproblem leading to Eq. (11) has no solution that are everywhere differentiable. The formation of an equatorial cusp\nat \u03a9 = \u03a9max marks the break-up of differentiability and\nthe complete change of structure. For \u03a9 > \u03a9max , the system may resemble a \"cuspy condensate\" + some matter\naccumulating at the box (ejected by the central body). We\ncan also wonder whether non-axisymmetric structures can\nform above \u03a9max . Indeed, there exists \"double-cluster\"\nsolutions for polytropes with index n > 0.808 (Hachisu\n& Eriguchi 1984) that bifurcate discontinuously from the\nspheroidal sequence. On general grounds, it would be of\ninterest to compare the entropy of the single cluster to\nthe entropy of the double cluster. This problem is left for\nfuture investigations.\nFor E = Emin and \u03a9 = \u03a9max , all the mass is in the\ncuspy polytrope. As E increases along the line of maximum rotation, the polytrope extends in size and is embedded in a disk-like halo (Fig. 2f). The maximum angular velocity \u03a9max (E) decreases with E. This is because\nthe size of the polytrope increases so that it is more easily affected by rotation. At high energies, the polytrope is\nvery extended and the cusp would form outside the confining box. Therefore, the structure of the system is highly\naffected by the wall and this makes possible to achieve\narbitrary large values of angular velocity. As a result, the\nmaximum angular velocity increases with the energy when\nE is large. For high rotations and high energies, the matter accumulates on the wall due to the centrifugal force\n(Fig. 2i). The density profile is close to the law\n1\n\n2 2\n\n\u03c1 = Ae 2 \u03b2\u03a9\n\ns\n\n,\n\n(40)\n\nwhich corresponds to the density of a rotating gas without\nself-gravity. Note that the iso-density lines are axial so that\na complete change of symmetry has occurred from Fig. 2h\nto Fig. 2i.\n\n3.5. Equilibrium phase diagram\nThe caloric curve T (E) is plotted in Fig. 3 for different\nvalues of angular velocity \u03a9. It has the typical \"N -shape\"\n\nstructure previously found for non-rotating and slowly rotating systems with high cut-off. The onset of instability can be determined by a turning point criterion (Katz\n1978). For \u03bc = 100, the equilibrium states are always stable in the microcanonical ensemble (they are maxima of\nentropy at fixed mass, energy and angular momentum) but\nthey are unstable in the canonical ensemble in the region\nof negative specific heats (they are saddle points of free\nenergy at fixed mass, temperature and angular velocity).\nWe see that, for moderate rotations, the structure of the\ncaloric curve does not change dramatically with respect\nto the non-rotating case. It is just a natural continuation\nof previously reported results. However, at high rotations,\nthe system is sensitive to mass shedding and there exists a\nmaximum angular velocity \u03a9max for each value of energy\nand temperature (Keplerian limit).\n\nFig. 3. The caloric curve of a rotating system with \u03bc =\n100. It has a N -shape structure characteristic of selfgravitating systems with large cut-off (\u03bc \u2264 \u03bcMT P =\n2670). The \"gaps\" in energy and temperature at high rotations are due to the absence of uniformly rotating solution above the Keplerian limit. The thin full line shows\nthe \u03a9 = 0 case while the thick line marks the entry in the\nKepler zone (shaded region in Figs. 4 and 5). In between\nlines show some intermediate cases.\nThe phase diagram in the (E, \u03a9) plane is plotted in\nFig. 4. Since the energy is assumed to be fixed, this diagram corresponds to the microcanonical description 1 .\nIn continuity with the non-rotating case, the horizontal\n1\n\nWe have used the angular velocity as a control parameter\ninstead of the angular momentum for commodity but also because it is the most natural variable to characterize a rotating\nsystem. Indeed, the conservation of angular momentum should\nnot be taken in a strict sense because it can always be satisfied by ejecting a small amount of mass far away with weak\ninfluence on the other constraints. For similar remarks con-\n\n\fP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\nFig. 4. Microcanonical phase diagram in the (E, \u03a9) plane\nfor \u03bc = 100. The maximum angular velocity \u03a9max (E)\ndepends on the energy. It is maximum for the T = 0 configuration (which corresponds to a n = 3/2 polytrope).\nThe parameters of this terminal point are \u03a9max = 3.06\nand Emin = \u22121.37.\nstructure of the diagram consists of three regions: a pure\n\"condensed\" phase for E < Econd , a pure \"gaseous\" phase\nfor E > Egas and a mixed \"core-halo\" phase for intermediate energies. Vertically, the diagram proceeds with increasing flattening until the Keplerian limit is reached for\n\u03a9 = \u03a9max (E). Above this line, the system is expected to\nexpulse matter far away and, possibly, create a Keplerian\ndisk or break into fragments.\nThe phase diagram in the (T, \u03a9) plane is plotted in\nFig. 5. Since the temperature is assumed to be fixed, this\ndiagram corresponds to the canonical description. The\nmixed phase with negative specific heats allowed in the\nmicrocanonical ensemble is replaced by a phase transition\nconnecting the \"gaseous\" phase to the \"condensed\" phase.\nBetween Tc and T\u2217 the system can be in a metastable\nstate. If it is initially prepared in a gaseous state, it will remain gaseous until the minimum temperature Tc at which\nit will collapse and become condensed. Inversely, if the\nsystem is initially prepared in a condensed state, it will\nremain condensed until the maximum temperature T\u2217 at\nwhich it will explode and become gaseous (see Fig. 1).\nTherefore, the configuration of the system in the H-zone\ndepends on its history. This is like a hysteretic cycle in\nmagnetism.\nLet us comment again on the distinction between L\nand \u03a9. If we restrict ourselves to single-cluster axisymmetric solutions, as we do, we do not expect qualitative\ndifference in the phase diagram according as we fix angular\ncerning the role of angular momentum in the context of vortex\ndynamics, see Brands et al. (1999).\n\n11\n\nFig. 5. Canonical phase diagram in the (T, \u03a9) plane for\n\u03bc = 100. The H-zone corresponds to an hysteretic zone\nwhere the actual phase depends on the history of the system.\n\nmomentum or angular velocity. Indeed, there is a one-toone correspondance between \u03a9 and L. This is very different if we allow for non-axisymmetric, or disconnected,\nsolutions (such as double clusters, rings,...) that are beyond the scope of the present paper. In that case, there is\nno one-to-one correspondance between \u03a9 and L and the\nchoice of the control parameter is crucial. The thermal energy Kth = E \u2212 W \u2212 12 I\u03a92 is for a single central cluster\nat the same E, \u03a9 much greater than for a double cluster with larger I and W . Thus, in (E, \u03a9) ensemble, the\ncentral system has more entropy (thermal random motion) than the double cluster. Hence, the single cluster\nwill overshadow the probability of the binary state (we\nthank the referee for this comment). On the other hand,\na double cluster rotates more slowly than a single central cluster with same L. Therefore, in (E, L) ensemble, a\nsingle cluster could avoid forming an equatorial cusp by\nsplitting in two pieces. Depending on L and E, the double\ncluster solution may have more entropy than the single\none. It would be of interest to consider this problem in\ndetail in the case of self-gravitating fermions. We do not\nknow if \"binary fermion balls\" have been introduced in\ndark matter models. We can wonder whether the transition from single to double clusters (if any) occurs at or\nbefore the Keplerian limit. Again, we emphasize that in\nthe case of self-gravitating fermions (similar to polytropes\nn = 3/2 > 0.808), this transition would be discontinuous\nwith respect to the spheroidal sequence.\n\n\f12\n\nP.H.

Therefore, the physical caloric curves must\ntake these metastable states into account and this gives rise to\nwhat we have nicknamed \"dinosaur's necks\". We recall that\nthese metastable states appear only for sufficiently small cutoffs. For large cut-offs (see Fig. 1), there is only one global\nentropy maximum for each energy and the \u03b2(E) curve is univalued. This is the situation considered by Votyakov et al.

By varying the energy of the system between E\u2217 and Ec (spinodal points), we can generate\nan hysteretic cycle in the microcanonical ensemble.\ntems (Chavanis & Sommeria 1998, Chavanis 2002b,c).\nThe upper branch corresponds to non-degenerate states\n(gaseous phase) and the lower branch corresponds to corehalo states (condensed phase). A first order microcanonical phase transition is expected to occur at Et (\u03bc) since at\nthis energy the two phases have the same entropy (Fig. 7).\nThis gravitational phase transition is marked by a discontinuity of temperature and specific heats. If Et > Egas\n(where Egas is the first turning point of temperature), the\nspecific heats passes from positive to negative values. If\nEt < Egas , the specific heats is always negative at the\ntransition (the crossing point occurs for \u03bc \u2243 1.10 104 ).\nHowever, this first order phase transition may not take\nplace in practice because the gaseous states with energy\nEc < E < Et are metastable (local entropy maxima) and\nlong-lived (Katz & Okamoto 2000, Chavanis & Ispolatov\n2002). The collapse (gravothermal catastrophe) will set in\nat, or near, the critical energy Ec (Antonov energy) at\nwhich the gaseous phase disapears. This corresponds to\na zeroth order microcanonical phase transition accompanied by a discontinuity of temperature and entropy. The\ncollapse stops when the central region becomes degenerate and forms a dense nucleus. The resulting configuration\nhas a \"core-halo\" structure. Contrary to the collapse in the\ncanonical ensemble, the nucleus contains only a moderate\nfraction of mass. In the classical limit \u03bc \u2192 +\u221e, it reduces\nto a single binary (see Sec. 5). The rest of the mass is diluted in a hot envelop (with almost uniform density) that\nis held by the walls of the box.

The condensed states with\nenergy Et < E < E\u2217 are also metastable and long-lived.\nAn \"explosion\", reversed to the gravothermal catastrophe,\nwill occur above E\u2217 if the system is initially prepared in\nthe condensed phase (see Fig. 7). By varying the energy\nbetween E\u2217 and Ec (microcanonical spinodal points) we\ncan generate an hysteretic cycle in the microcanonical ensemble (Chavanis 2003b).\nThe phase diagram describing the microcanonical\nphase transition is represented in Fig. 8. It can be compared with the phase diagram describing the canonical\nphase transition for \u03bc = 100 (see Fig. 5), the role of energy\nE and temperature T being reversed. In particular, there\nexists a H-zone in which the structure of the system (gas\nor condenstate) depends on its history. For smaller energies (E < Ec ), the system is in a mixed phase with negative specific heats. For even lower energies Econd \u223c \u2212117\n(not represented on the diagram), we leave the region of\nnegative specific heats and enter the pure condensed phase\nas in Fig. 4. More details on these phase transitions can be\nfound in Chavanis (2002b). It is shown in particular that\nthe microcanonical first order phase transition disapears\nfor \u03bc < \u03bcMT P = 2670.\n\n5. Gravothemal catastrophe for classical\nself-gravitating particles (no cut-off)\nWe now consider the limit \u03bc = +\u221e (or h = 0) corresponding to classical particles. In that limit, the particles do not\nfeel any kind of exclusion or small-scale cut-off. This is the\nsituation relevant for globular clusters for which the size\nof the stars does not matter.\n\n13\n\nIn the non degenerate limit, the caloric curve has a\nclassical spiral shape (Fig. 9). We recall that, in the absence of small-scale cut-off, the equilibrium states are\nonly metastable as they correspond to local maxima of\nthe thermodynamical potential (entropy or free energy).\nThese metastable states play however an important role\nas they correspond to the observed structures (see discussion in Chavanis 2003a). In the microcanonical ensemble, the gravothermal catastrophe sets in at the Antonov\nenergy Ec . The microcanonical phase diagram in (E, \u03a9)\nplane is drawn in Fig. 10 and shows in particular the evolution of the Antonov critical energy Ec (\u03a9) with the rotation. The critical energy Ec (\u03a9) increases with rotation so\nthat gravitational collapse occurs sooner than in the nonrotating case. This confirms the results of the perturbative\napproach (Chavanis 2002c). Qualitatively, the critical energy increases due to the rotational term 12 I\u03a92 > 0 in\nthe expression of E (see Sec. 2.5). The result of the collapse is to form a binary star with large binding energy.\nSince total energy is conserved, the gravitational energy\nreleased by the binary is redistributed in a dilute halo\nin the form of thermal energy. This evolution is natural\nin the microcanonical ensemble since it can produce very\nhigh (ideally diverging) values of entropy due to the divergence of the temperature. It is also vindicated by numerical simulations of the orbit averaged Fokker-Planck\nequation (Cohn 1980) or fluid equations (Lynden-Bell &\nEggleton 1980). These simulations show that the collapse\nof globular clusters is self-similar and leads to a finite time\nsingularity with a density profile \u03c1 \u223c r\u2212\u03b1 with \u03b1 \u2243 2.2.\nThe mass contained in the core goes to zero (indicating\nthat the collapse is halted by the formation of binaries\nwith mass 2m \u226a M ) while the central temperature raises\nto +\u221e since \u03b1 > 2. Binary-like structures are also found\nin the microcanonical model of self-gravitating Brownian\nparticles (Sire & Chavanis 2003).\nIn the canonical ensemble, the collapse sets in at\nthe critical temperature Tc . The evolution of this critical temperature with the angular velocity is represented\nin Fig. 10. It is found that Tc (\u03a9) decreases with \u03a9 so that\ngravitational collapse is delayed in the canonical ensemble.\nThis corroborates the results found with the perturbative\napproach (Chavanis 2002c). The result of the collapse is\nto form a Dirac peak, i.e. a state where all the mass is concentrated at the center (\"black hole\"). This evolution is\nnatural in the canonical ensemble since it can produce very\nhigh (in fact diverging) values of free energy J = S \u2212 \u03b2E\ndue to the divergence of the potential energy. This isothermal collapse can be followed dynamically by solving the\nEuler-Jeans equations for a gaseous system with an equation of state p = \u03c1T where T is fixed (Penston 1969). It\ncan also be studied analytically in the canonical model of\nself-gravitating Brownian particles (Chavanis et al. 2002).\nIn this model, there is first a finite time singularity leading to a r\u22122 density profile. Then, the collapse continues\nafter the singularity is formed and the Dirac peak appears\nin the post-collapse regime due to the accretion of mass\n(Sire & Chavanis 2002,2003). We expect this two-stage\n\n\f14\n\nP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\nFig. 10. Dependence of the Antonov critical energy and critical temperature with rotation. For high energies or\nhigh temperatures, the system is in a gaseous (metastable) phase. Below a critical energy or temperature, it enters\nin the collapsed phase. In the microcanonical ensemble (fixed E), the collapse leads to a single binary (or a small\ngroup of stars) surrounded by a hot dilute halo. In the canonical ensemble (fixed T ), the collapse leads to a Dirac\npeak containing all the mass (\"black hole\"). This Dirac peak forms in the post-collapse regime of the dynamical\nevolution. For small rotations, the critical energy and critical temperature behave as Ec (\u03a9) = Ec (0) + 0.175\u03a92 and\n1/Tc(\u03a9) = 1/Tc(0) + 0.552\u03a92 (dotted lines). This scaling is valid typically for \u03a9 \u2264 0.5.\nbehaviour to persist in the case of more relevant dynamical models. This may be an important point for numerical\nsimulations in astrophysics and cosmology because if we\nonly consider the first regime we conclude that the core\ncontains no mass (while its density is high and scales as\nr\u22122 ). However, in a post-collapse regime, a Dirac peak\nis formed which contains a macroscopic mass at a single\npoint. We can wonder whether this mechanism (apparently not reported before) is related to the existence of\nblack holes at the center of galaxies. In reality, small-scale\ncut-offs must be introduced (e.g., quantum degeneracy)\nand the black hole singularity is replaced by a \"fermion\nball\" with a high mass. Note that in the microcanonical\nensemble, there is no black hole singularity for classical\npoint masses (the Dirac peak is replaced by a binary).\nInterestingly, for self-gravitating fermions, the condensate\n(fermion ball) contains a moderate but macroscopic fraction of mass (Chavanis & Sommeria 1998). This may explain the formation of massive objects at the center of\ngalaxies in a microcanonical framework. The microcanonical description is the most relevant as it accounts for the\ntransfers of energy between the core and the halo contrary\nto isothermal models.\nThe divergence of entropy in the microcanonical ensemble due to the formation of a binary embedded in a hot\nhalo is implicit in the work of Antonov (1962). It is also\nclear from the arguments given by Padmanabhan (1990)\n\nto show that the density of state diverges as we approach\ntwo particles to each other provided that thermal energy\ncan be redistributed in a halo (this demands N \u2265 3).\nThe divergence of free energy in the canonical ensemble\nby forming a Dirac peak has been shown rigorously by\nKiessling (1989) and heuristically by Chavanis (2002e).\nThe inequivalence of statistical ensembles regarding the\nformation of binaries or Dirac peaks is further discussed\nin Appendices A and B of Sire & Chavanis (2002). In\nthis approach, a family of distributions functions is constructed which provokes the divergence of entropy or free\nenergy when a physical parameter is varied. These results\ncan also be obtained by considering the small cut-off limit\n\u03bc \u2192 +\u221e in the analytical model of phase transitions for\nself-gravitating systems proposed by Chavanis (2002b).\n\n6. Phase diagram of non-rotating systems\nIn previous sections, we have presented the equilibrium\nphase diagram of self-gravitating fermions as a function\nof angular velocity \u03a9 for a fixed value of degeneracy parameter \u03bc. We shall now discuss the equilibrium phase\ndiagram of self-gravitating fermions (or hard sphere systems) as a function of \u03bc for \u03a9 = 0. These phase diagrams\nhave not been published before.\nThe deformation of the caloric curve T (E) as a function of the degeneracy parameter \u03bc is described in detail\n\n\fP.H. Chavanis and M.

Below\nTc , the isothermal collapse generates a Dirac peak (canonical ensemble).\n\nby Chavanis (2002b). This work completes earlier studies\non phase transitions in self-gravitating systems by showing\nthe small cut-off limit, characterized by an unwound spiral\n(\"dinosaur's neck\"), leading to a first order microcanonical phase transition (earlier works essentially described the\ncanonical first order phase transition). Typical curves illustrating first order canonical and first order microcanonical phase transitions are shown in Figs. 1 and 7. The equilibrium phase diagram of self-gravitating fermions can be\ndirectly deduced from these results by identifying characteristic energies and temperatures. In the canonical ensemble, we note Tt the temperature of transition (determined\nby the equality of the free energies of the two phases),\nTc the end point of the metastable gaseous phase (first\nturning point of temperature) and T\u2217 the end point of the\nmetastable condensed phase (last turning point of temperature). The temperature of transition Tt is determined by\na horizontal Maxwell construction (Chavanis 2003b). The\ncanonical phase diagram is shown in Fig. 11. It shows in\nparticular the canonical critical point \u03bcCT P = 83 at which\nthe canonical first order phase transition disappears and\nis replaced by a localized second order phase transition.\nIn the microcanonical ensemble, we note Et the energy of transition (determined by the equality of the entropy of the two phases), Ec (Antonov energy) the end\npoint of the metastable gaseous phase (first turning point\nof energy) and E\u2217 the end point of the metastable condensed phase (last turning point of energy). The energy\nof transition Et is determined by a less standard vertical Maxwell construction (Chavanis 2003b). We also de-\n\nnote by Egas the energy at which we enter in the mixed\nphase with negative specific heat (first turning point of\ntemperature) and Econd the energy at which we leave the\nmixed phase and enter the condensed phase (last turning point of temperature). We also introduce the minimum energy Emin (ground state). The microcanonical\nphase diagram is shown in Fig. 12. It shows in particular\nthe microcanonical critical point \u03bcMT P = 2670 at which\nthe microcanonical first order phase transition disappears.\nThe structure of the equilibrium phase diagrams can be\neasily understood in the light of the preceding discussion\n(see Chavanis 2002b for more details). We note that the\nmicrocanonical phase diagram is more complex than the\ncanonical one due to the existence of a negative specific\nheat region. We recall that canonical stability (maximum\nof J at fixed M , \u03b2) is a sufficient, albeit not necessary, condition of microcanonical stability (maximum of S at fixed\nM , E). Since canonical equilibria are always realized as\nmicrocanonical equilibria, they constitute a sub-domain\nof the microcanonical phase diagram. Hence, the microcanonical ensemble is richer than the canonical one, as is\nwell-known.\n\n7. Conclusion\nWe have calculated single-cluster axisymmetric statistical equilibrium states of self-gravitating fermions for arbitrary values of rotation and temperature (or energy).\nThe problems associated with the divergence of the gravitational potential as r \u2192 0 have been avoided by considering quantum effects. This small-scale regularization\nis a physical one because the Pauli exclusion principle is\na fundamental concept and fermionic matter is relevant\nin astrophysics. Isothermal and polytropic configurations\n(with index n = 3/2) are obtained as particular limits of\nour model (T \u2192 +\u221e and T = 0). On the other hand, depending on the importance of rotation, we have obtained\n\n\f16\n\nP.H. Chavanis and M.

The phase diagram in MCE is more complex than\nin CE due to the existence of the negative specific heat\nregion that is forbidden in CE.\n\ndifferent types of structures such as fermion balls, fermion\nspheroids and cuspy structures. In the mixed phase, these\ncondensed objects are surrounded by a diffuse isothermal\nhalo. Clearly, the main drawback of our study is the necessity to enclose the system within an artificial box so\nas to prevent its complete evaporation (which is the true\nstatistical equilibrium state for self-gravitating systems).\nA future extension of our study is to consider more realistic truncated models in order to avoid the artifice of a\nmaterial box and take into account incomplete relaxation\nor tidal effects. We note, in passing, that the distribution\nfunction f = f (\u01ebJ ) predicted by statistical mechanics cannot account for the triaxial structure of elliptical galaxies since no bifurcation from axisymmetric (spheroidal)\nto non-axisymmetric (ellipsoidal) structures are expected\nfor uniformly rotating compressible bodies. The distribution function must depend on isolated integrals different\nfrom the single Jacobi integral (Contopoulos 1960). This\nis clearly a manifestation of incomplete relaxation but the\nconstruction of such isolated integrals is a highly complicated task and demands a very delicate analysis of the\nprocess of formation of elliptical galaxies.\nWe emphasize that the nature of the small-scale cutoff is of considerable importance for rotating objects, regarding the structure of the condensed phase, because\nit can generate or inhibit non-axisymmetric instabilities.\nFor example, the ordinary Fermi-Dirac distribution used\nin this paper and the model of Votyakov et al. (2002)\nhave the same high temperature limit (an isothermal gas\nwith p = \u03c1T ) but a different low temperature limit. The\nFermi gas at T = 0 corresponds to the equation of state\np = K\u03c15/3 (polytropic core). The equation of state corresponding to a Fermi-Dirac distribution in configuration\nspace \u03c1 = \u03c1max /[1+\u03bbexp(\u03b2\u03a6ef f )] is p = T ln(1\u2212\u03c1/\u03c1max),\nas can be obtained from the condition of hydrostatic equi-\n\nlibrium 3 . For T = 0, \u03c1 is a step function with \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1max\nfor r < R\u2217 (solid core) and \u03c1 = 0 otherwise. In the\nformer case (fermions), there is no bifurcation to nonaxisymmetric structures at high rotations in continuity\nwith the spheroidal sequence. Instead, the system develops an equatorial cusp (the possibility of discontinuous\nbifurcations to non-axisymmetric structures will be considered in a future work). This cusp does not exist for\nhomogeneous bodies (or hard sphere systems) and nonaxisymmetric bifurcations occur continuously at high rotations. It is surprising that the equation of state corresponding to the model of Votyakov et al. (2002) does not\ncoincide with the Van der Waals equation of state, as in\nthe work of Aronson & Hansen (1972), since these authors\ntreat their system as a hard sphere gas 4 . It is also surprising that they do not obtain a richer variety of structures in\nthe low temperature/energy regime (pear shaped, dumbbell,...) since rotating homogeneous bodies possess a rich\nbifurcation diagram as investigated since the 19-th century (Chandrasekhar 1969). These remarks show that the\nsmall-scale regularization must be given precise consideration depending on the situation contemplated.\nThe self-gravitating Fermi gas has several astrophysical applications: (i) Lynden-Bell's type of degeneracy may\nbe relevant for galactic nuclei and dark matter (LyndenBell 1967, Kull et al. 1996, Chavanis & Sommeria 1998,\nStiavelli 1998, Leeuwin & Athanassoula 2000). (ii) Pauli's\nexclusion principle is relevant for white dwarfs and neutron stars (Chandrasekhar 1942, Hertel & Thirring 1971).\nIn that context, the Fermi gas at non-zero temperature\nprovides a simple theoretical model describing a phase\ntransition from a \"gaseous star\" (for T > Tc ) to a\nwhite dwarf or a neutron star (for T < Tc ). To obtain\na better description of these objects, special relativity\nmust be taken into account for massive white dwarf stars\n3\n\nA Fermi-Dirac distribution in configuration space also\narises in the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional vortices\n(see Chavanis 2002a for a review on the analogy between stellar\nsystems and 2D vortices). In that respect, it may be relevant to\nmention the work of Chen & Cross (1996) who found \"doublevortex\" equilibrium solutions in a circular domain when the\nconservation of angular momentum is accounted for. This can\nbe viewed as the 2D hydrodynamical version of the \"doublestar\" structure found by Votyakov et al. (2002). Note that the\npresence of a confining box is crucial to maintain the doublevortex solution. Similarly, for self-gravitating systems at nonzero temperature, an artificial box is needed to maintain the\ndouble-star structure.\n4\nIn fact, Votyakov et al (2002) prevent overlapping of particles in physical space, as in a lattice gas model. This is a simple way to limit the local density \u03c1(r) of the self-gravitating\ngas. Hence, their model is expected to represent stars at densities up to the ignition of their hydrogen burning, when further\ngravitational collapse is halted for a while (Gross 2003). In\nthis context, it may be relevant to consider a large small-scale\ncut-off, as they do. Note that their model does not correspond\nto the Lynden-Bell (1967) statistics, which is a Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution in phase space appropriate to collisionless stellar\nsystems (e.g., Chavanis 2002d).\n\n\fP.H. Chavanis and M. Rieutord: Rotating self-gravitating fermions\n\n(Chandrasekhar 1931) and general relativity is required\nin the case of neutron stars (Oppenheimer & Volkoff\n1939). (iii) It has been proposed recently that dark matter could be made of a collisionless gas of massive neutrinos. Therefore, the relevant distribution function is again\nthe Fermi-Dirac distribution (see, e.g., Chavanis 2002f).\nThe degeneracy is due either to the Liouville theorem (in\nthe context of violent relaxation) or to Pauli's exclusion\nprinciple (if quantum effects are relevant). By cooling below a critical temperature, this neutrino gas is expected\nto undergo a phase transition to a compact object called\na \"fermion ball\". It has been proposed that fermion balls\ncould provide an alternative to black holes at the center of\ngalaxies (Bilic & Viollier 1997). (iv) Incidentally, our study\ncan also be connected to models of rotating stars (e.g.,\nRoxburgh et al. 1965). Low mass stars (M <\n\u223c 1.5 M\u2299 ) of\nthe main sequence have a radiative core and a convective\nenvelope. Massive stars (M > 1.8 M\u2299 ) have the opposite\nconfiguration. Now, the convective region corresponds to\na polytrope of index n = 3/2. Coincidentally, this case is\nprecisely covered by our study.\nOn the other hand, hard spheres models have less direct applications in astrophysics because the inter-particle\ndistance is always considerably larger than their size.\nIndeed, globular clusters can be either in dilute metastable\nequilibrium states (Michie 1963, King 1966) or in a collapsing phase ending up with the formation of binaries\n(H\u00e9non 1961). These binaries can release sufficient energy\nto drive a re-expansion of the system (Inagaki & LyndenBell 1983, Bettwieser & Sugimoto 1984) so that complete\ncollapse is prevented in practice. In each case, the size\nof the stars does not matter. The size of the atoms in\nstars does not matter neither because radiative transfers\nkeep the star in a gaseous phase far from condensation.\nWhen a star collapses (because it has burned its nuclear\nfuel), gravity is balanced by quantum pressure not by the\npressure of a hard sphere gas. In that respect, it may be\nuseful to recall that the hard sphere model of Aronson &\nHansen (1972) was presented as a crude model for neutron\nstars where the hard spheres were introduced to mimick\nquantum degeneracy. The hard-sphere model can however\nfind physical applications in the context of planet formation resulting from the gravitational collapse of dust particles in the solar nebula (Chavanis 2000). It has also been\nused by Stahl et al. (1994) to describe the formation of\nstars or planetoids (considered as the solid phase) resulting from the condensation of a molecular cloud (considered as the gaseous phase). In this context, the explosion,\nreverse to the collapse, may be related to the supernova\nphenomenon.\nFinally, our study has a direct relevance in terms of\nfundamental statistical mechanics. Indeed, the different\ntypes of phase transitions arising in the self-gravitating\nFermi gas (Chavanis 2002b) display a very rich structure:\ninequivalence of statistical ensembles, negative specific\nheats, convex intruder in the entropy-energy curve, canonical and microcanonical first order phase transitions, second order phase transition, zeroth order phase transition,\n\n17\n\ncanonical and microcanonical critical points, metastable\nstates, hysteretic cycles,... Such properties are probably\ncommon to other systems with long-range interactions. In\nfact, the self-gravitating Fermi gas forms a generic example of systems displaying codimensions 0 and 1 singularities in the classification of phase transitions (for longrange interactions) recently proposed by Bouchet & Barr\u00e9\n(2003). Therefore, the detailed study of phase transitions\nin the self-gravitating Fermi gas at non-zero temperature\nis of interest both for statistical mechanics and astrophysics. This point is important because the statistical\nmechanics of self-gravitating systems was considered until\nrecently, as a curiosity, not to say a fallacy, by statistical\nmechanicians.\nAn extension of our study would be to compute more\ncomplex configurations of rapidly rotating self-gravitating\nfermions and n = 3/2 polytropes (double clusters, rings\nand core-ring sequences) in both microcanonical (fixed E,\nM and L) and canonical (fixed T , M and \u03a9) ensembles.\nThese solutions are expected to bifurcate discontinuously\nfrom the spheroidal sequence in contrast to hard sphere\nsystems and homogeneous bodies (n = 0). It would be important (but difficult) to investigate the stability of these\nvarious configurations. For rigid bodies (n < 0.808 polytropes and hard sphere systems at low temperature), the\nspheroidal sequence becomes unstable (saddle points of\nS or J) above a certain rotation at which the branch\nof non-axisymmetric structures appears. For high rotations, double clusters are global maxima of S or J and\nthe ring sequence is always unstable (saddle points of S\nor J). For compressible bodies (n > 0.808 polytropes and\nfermionic matter at low temperature), the spheroidal sequence is expected to remain stable (maxima of S or J)\nuntil the Keplerian limit since no continuous bifurcations\nexist. However, it is possible that, for high rotations, the\nsingle cluster structures computed in this paper are only\nmetastable (local maxima of S or J) and that the true\nequilibrium states (global maxima of S or J) are double\nclusters or core-ring configurations. In case when several\nstable solutions exist for the same values of E, L (or \u03b2,\n\u03a9), it may be important to compare their entropy and\nfree energy. However, the selection of the physical equilibrium state will depend more on a notion of basin of attraction (see, e.g., Chavanis et al. 2002 in a related context)\nthan whether it is a global or a local maximum of S or\nJ. Thus, a dynamical study is required. We hope to come\nto these problems in future communications. The present\npaper is only a first step in that direction. To be more realistic, the box could be avoided by using the distribution\nfunction (15) which provides a more physical confinement\nof the system. We also emphasize that in a large domain,\nthe conservation of angular momentum can be satisfied by\nejecting a weak amount of mass at large distances, for example in the form of a Keplerian disk. This is the typical\nstructure of a protoplanetary nebula. Indeed, during the\nformation of a (single) star by gravitational collapse of a\nmolecular cloud, about 99% of the intial angular momentum is spread in a protoplanetary disk while 99% of the\n\n\f18\n\nP.H.
