INTRODUCTION\n\nMeasuring the redshift evolution of the mass function\nof galaxy clusters provides powerful constraints on cosmological parameters, complementary to those obtained\nfrom different measurements, such as the angular power\nspectrum of the cosmic microwave background (e.g.,\nKomatsu et al. 2010) or luminosity distances of Type Ia\nsupernovae (e.g., Hicken et al. 2009). The potential of\ncluster surveys as a cosmological probe has recently been\ndemonstrated through the analysis of large X-ray and\noptically selected cluster samples spanning a wide range\nin redshift (e.g., Vikhlinin et al. 2009; Mantz et al. 2010;\nRozo et al. 2010).\nA powerful method for cluster detection and characterization is provided by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(SZ) effect. The SZ effect is the process by which energy is transferred from the hot intra-cluster medium\n(ICM) of galaxy clusters to the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) through inverse Compton scattering (Zel'dovich & Sunyaev 1969; Sunyaev & Zel'dovich\n1970). The overall effect is to distort the thermal\nspectrum of the CMB. In the case of the present\nstudy at 148 GHz, the SZ distortion produces a roughly\narcminute-scale temperature decrement along the line\nof sight to a galaxy cluster. The SZ distortion is proportional to the pressure of the ICM integrated along\nthe line of sight, providing a unique probe of cluster physics. The integrated SZ flux therefore scales as\nthe thermal energy content of the cluster, which is expected to scale with cluster mass for cluster gas hydrostatically supported by thermal pressure. The amplitude of the SZ distortion is approximately independent\nof the cluster redshift, in marked contrast to the observed cluster brightness in other wave bands. Therefore, the SZ effect is particularly suited for inventorying the distant universe. Galaxy cluster surveys are\none of the few methods that probe the growth of structure and interpretation of survey yields has the potential to precisely constrain the equation of state of\ndark energy (e.g., Bartlett & Silk 1994; Holder et al.\n2000; Haiman et al. 2001; Majumdar & Mohr 2004). For\na full description of the SZ effect, historical perspectives, and applications to cosmology, see the review articles by Bernstein & Dodelson (1990), Birkinshaw (1991),\nRephaeli (1995), Birkinshaw (1999), and Carlstrom et al.\n(2002).\nThe history of successful targeted observations of\nthe SZ effect in previously known galaxy clusters goes\nback two decades. Pioneering measurements were made\nwith the OVRO 40m telescope (Birkinshaw et al. 1991),\nthe Ryle Telescope (Jones et al. 1993), the OVRO 5m\ntelescope (Herbig et al. 1995; Myers et al. 1997), the\nOVRO/BIMA interferometers (Carlstrom et al. 1996),\nthe bolometric SUZIE receiver on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (Holzapfel et al. 1997), and\nthe Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope\n(Komatsu et al. 1999). Scientifically these original studies put special emphasis on deriving the Hubble parameter from angular diameter distances to clusters mea31 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA 02138\n32 Department of Astronomy, University of Massachusetts,\nAmherst, MA, USA 01003\n\nsured through a combination of SZ and X-ray data.\nIn the last decade, these geometric measurements have\nbeen expanded to statistically significant samples of\nclusters (e.g., the OVRO/BIMA studies by Reese et al.\n2002 and Bonamente et al. 2006) and serve as an independent check on estimates that rely on the conventional extragalactic distance ladder (e.g., Freedman et al.\n2001; Riess et al. 2009). Beyond distance scale studies, targeted SZ work has focused on understanding\nthe SZ correlation to other cluster observables, especially those which trace mass (e.g., Benson et al.\n2004; Bonamente et al. 2008; McInnes et al. 2009;\nMarrone et al. 2009; Melin et al. 2010; Huang et al.\n2010; Plagge et al. 2010; Culverhouse et al. 2010). The\nSZ/X-ray and SZ/optical lensing correlations provide the\nmass calibration necessary for understanding the cluster mass function through cosmic time. By measuring the redshift evolution of the cluster mass function,\nconstraints can be put on the matter density field and\ndark energy. Thus proper mass calibration is essential\nfor studying cosmology with clusters (e.g., Francis et al.\n2005). Finally, targeted SZ observations are expanding\nour knowledge of the physics of the ICM by probing the\ncluster gas pressure at large radius (Mroczkowski et al.\n2009; Plagge et al. 2010; Komatsu et al. 2010) as well\nas at high resolution (Komatsu et al. 2001; Mason et al.\n2010).\nThe first blind detections of galaxy clusters through\ntheir Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect were reported by\nStaniszewski et al. (2009) for the South Pole Telescope (SPT; Carlstrom et al. 2009). Three of the clusters from Staniszewski et al. (2009) were previously unknown. Hincks et al. (2009) reported on the cluster detections for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT;\nFowler et al. 2007; Swetz et al. 2010). While the clusters from Hincks et al. (2009) were previously known,\nthey were blindly detected in the survey data. SPT\nand ACT have been able to realize blind detections from\ncosmologically significant surveys because they combine three essential design features: arcminute resolution matched to the size of clusters, degree-scale fields\nof view for efficient surveying, and the unprecedented\nsensitivity of 1000-element bolometric detector arrays.\nIn Vanderlinde et al. (2010), the SPT collaboration reported on twenty-one cluster candidates, twenty of which\nwere optically confirmed (High et al. 2010). In a followup study, Andersson et al. (2010) presented the X-ray\nproperties of the SPT sample and derived SZ/X-Ray\ncorrelations. Furthermore, Vanderlinde et al. (2010) obtained cosmological constraints from an SZ-selected sample of clusters.\nIn this work, the ACT collaboration reports on\ntwenty-three clusters detected in a subset of the data\ntaken during the 2008 observing season. This paper describes the detection and millimeter properties\nof the clusters.

The\ndetections and their properties are discussed in Section 3.\nAn estimate of purity and completeness of the sample is\nderived from simulations in Section 4. Finally, in Section\n5, the SZ signal is compared to X-ray-derived mass for a\nhigh significance subset of the cluster sample.\n2. FROM OBSERVATIONS TO CLUSTER DETECTION\n\nThe observations and methods to reduce the raw data\nto maps for this work are the same as used in the 2008\npower spectrum study (Fowler et al. 2010) and extragalactic source study (Marriage et al. 2010). The primary difference between the source and cluster study\nlies in the compact signal profile used in the implementation of the matched filter-based detection. Therefore,\nwe restrict our discussion here to a short summary of the\nobservations and data reduction, and refer the reader to\nFowler et al. (2010) and Marriage et al. (2010) for a more\ncomplete description. We describe in detail the particular implementation of the matched filter for clusters. For\na description of the ACT receiver and instrumentation\nsee Swetz et al. (2010).\n2.1. Observations and Data Reduction\n\nACT is a six-meter telescope operating at 5200 m in\nthe Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The site was chosen for its excellent atmospheric transparency and access\nto both southern and northern skies. The telescope has\nthree 1024-element arrays of transition edge sensors operating at 148 GHz, 218 GHz, and 277 GHz. This study\nuses 148 GHz data from a 455 square-degree subregion of\nthe 2008 southern survey. The subregion lies between\nright ascensions 00h12m and 07h 08m and declinations\n\u221256\u25e6 11\u2032 and \u221249\u25e6 00\u2032 . Figure 1 is a map of the sensitivity across the subregion along with the locations of\nthe clusters reported in this study. The median rms of\nthe map optimally filtered for detecting a \u03b2-model profile\n(\u03b2 = 0.86, \u03b8c = 1.00\u2032 ) is 36\u03bcK.\nThe data for this study were calibrated to the temperature of Uranus with a precision of 6%. The absolute positional uncertainty in the maps is established\n\nat 3.5\u2032\u2032 by comparison of ACT radio source locations\n(Marriage et al. 2010) to cross-identified sources in the\nAustralia Telescope 20 GHz Survey (Murphy et al. 2010).\nNote, however, that reported cluster locations have an\nadditional uncertainty due to the effect of noise on the\nestimate of the cluster center. Considering the positional uncertainty for sources detected between signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) 5.5 and 10 reported in Marriage et al.\n(2010), we expect estimates of the ACT cluster center\npositions to scatter with an rms of roughly 10\u2032\u2032 . Additional ambiguity in the cluster position arises in the\ncase of an extended, non-spherical (e.g., disturbed) system. In such cases, the positional uncertainty can rise to\narcminute scales.\nWith calibration and astrometry solved, the final step\nin the data reduction is map making. We iteratively\nsolve for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the\nmap using a custom preconditioned conjugate gradient\ncode (e.g., Press et al. 1992). Because ACT samples the\nsky along multiple scan directions (i.e., the data is crosslinked), we are able to produce an unbiased ML map\nof the microwave sky with a faithful representation of\nstructure from degree to arcminute scales.\n2.2. Filtering and Cluster Extraction\nFor cluster detection we use matched filters\n(Haehnelt & Tegmark 1996; Herranz et al. 2002;\nMelin et al. 2006). We model the sky temperature\nfluctuation at a point x as\nX\n\u03b4T0,i B\u03b8c ,i (x \u2212 xi ) + \u03b4Tother (x)\n(1)\n\u03b4T (x) =\ni\n\nwhere \u03b4T0,i and B\u03b8c ,i are the amplitude and unitnormalized profile of the ith cluster. In what follows we\nchoose B\u03b8c to be the isothermal \u03b2-model ( \u03b2 = 0.86 ) with\ncore radius \u03b8c ranging from 0.25\u2032 to 4.0\u2032 and convolved\nwith an isotropic ACT 148 GHz beam from Hincks et al.\n(2009). The profile is tapered to zero by multiplication\nwith a cosine in the range 0.5\u20135.5\u03b8c. The choice of \u03b2\nis motivated by the best fit to an average SZ profile in\nPlagge et al. (2010) who found consistency between the\n\u03b2-model fit and the Generalized NFW profile fit to YX in\n\n\f4\n\nMarriage et al.\n\n-52\n\n400\n\n10\n10\n\n-53\b\n\n10\n\nDec.

This weighting levels the amplitude of white noise across the map to that corresponding to the deepest data. The data is then\nmatch-filtered with a \u03b2-profile (\u03b8c = 1.0\u2032 ). The coverage becomes shallower toward the bottom-left of the map causing a visible increase in\nthe rms. The inset shows the flux density distribution across the data weighted by the square-root of the number of data per pixel. The\ndata distribution is shown as a gray histogram on which is plotted a dashed Gaussian distribution with standard deviation 24\u03bcK. Sources\nwere removed prior to filtering. Three clusters are recognizable from left to right: the Bullet Cluster (bottom-left), A3404 (middle), and\nAS0592 (middle-right).\n\nArnaud et al. (2009). The temperature field \u03b4Tother (x)\nconsists of noise modeled from difference maps, primordial CMB fluctuations with power spectrum from\nNolta et al. (2009), as well as sources and undetectable\n(i.e., low mass) clusters. The spectral signature of the\nsource and cluster contribution to \u03b4Tother (x) is modeled from fits to ACT data in Fowler et al. (2010). See\nMarriage et al. (2010) for a full discussion of \u03b4Tother(x).\nBefore filtering, bright (SNR > 5) sources are inpainted with sky temperature in the neighborhood of the\nsource. Furthermore, the map is weighted by the inverse\nsquare root of the number of observations. This has the\neffect of flattening the white noise across the map. The\nmap is filtered in the Fourier domain using a matched\nfilter:\n\u03b4Tfilt (k) = R\n\nf other (k) |\u22122 \u03b4T (k)\ne \u2217 (k) | \u03b4T\nB\n\u03b8c\nf other (k\u2032 ) |\u22122 B\ne\u03b8 (k\u2032 )dk\u2032\ne \u2217 (k\u2032 ) | \u03b4T\nB\n\u03b8c\n\n(2)\n\nc\n\nf other (k) are the Fourier transforms\ne\u03b8c (k) and \u03b4T\nwhere B\n\nof B\u03b8c and \u03b4Tother , respectively. The map is filtered using \u03b2-models with core radii from 0.25\u2032 to 4.0\u2032 in 0.25\u2032\nsteps. These core radii were chosen to span the range of\nangular scales characterizing massive clusters from low\nto high redshift. In a given map, the SNR of a detection\nis defined as the ratio of the extremum of the cluster\ndecrement to the rms of the filtered map. The reported\nSNR for a given detection is the maximum SNR from the\nset of filtered maps. Figure 2 shows a subsection of the\nsource-masked and filtered map containing three known\nclusters. Shown in an inset of this figure is the pixel\nflux distribution of the filtered map. The flux distribution suggests the filtered map is dominated by Gaussian\nnoise.\nThe filter in Eq. 2 is normalized such that the central\ndecrement in the filtered map is an estimate of the central decrement value in \u03bcK. It is this value, recovered\nfrom the filtered map, which we use as our decrement\nestimate. As discussed in Marriage et al. (2010), this estimate suffers from increased error and bias due to the\n\n\fSZ-Selected Galaxy Clusters from ACT\n\n5\n\nJ0658-5557\n\nJ0638-5358\n\nJ0245-5302\n\nJ0102-4915\n\nJ0438-5419\n\nJ0645-5413\n\n1E0657-56\nJ0546-5345\n\nAS0592\nJ0235-5121\n\nAS0295\nJ0330-5227\n\nNew\nJ0616-5227\n\nNew\nJ0559-5249\n\nA3404\nJ0215-5212\n\nSPT-0547-5345\nJ0509-5341\n\nNew\nJ0641-4949\n\nA3128(NE)\nJ0232-5257\n\nNew\nJ0516-5430\n\nSPT-J0559-5249\nJ0346-5438\n\nNew\nJ0217-5245\n\nSPT-0509-5342\nJ0145-5301\n\nA3402\nJ0237-4939\n\nNew\nJ0304-4921\n\nAS0520\nJ0707-5522\n\nNew\nJ0528-5259\n\nRXC J0217-5244\n\nA2941\n\nNew\n\nNew\n\nNew\n\nSPT-0528-5300\n\nFig. 3.- Temperature decrements at 148 GHz of twenty-three clusters. Each thumbnail is approximately 8\u2032 on a side and is excised\nfrom the source-removed, filtered map. The grayscale of each thumbnail is symmetric about zero with a range set to the depth of the\ndecrement. The ordering of the clusters is according to decreasing SNR from left to right and top to bottom. The structure northeast\nof ACT-CL J0641-4949 may be part of the cluster or may be contamination: the decrement of this nearby cluster may be noise boosted.\nACT designations are at the top of each thumbnail and alternate names at the bottom, denoted \"New\" if newly discovered by ACT.\n\n0.5\u2032 pixel size of the ACT maps. In order to mitigate\nthese errors, the pixel size of sub-maps around each detection is decreased by Fourier transforming the map and\nadding extra zeros to the boundary of the Fourier transform. The inverse of this zero-padded transform is then\nthe original submap with smaller pixels. For this study,\nthe pixel size is changed to 0.0625\u2032 which reduces the errors associated with the discrete approximation of Eq. 2\nto less than 1%. The errors we quote for the map-derived\ndecrements are simply the decrement amplitude divided\nby the SNR.\n3. CLUSTER DETECTIONS AND PROPERTIES\n\nTable 1 lists clusters detected by ACT. All detections\nin the table have been confirmed through optical followup imaging of a larger catalog of all SZ candidates from\nthe ACT data (Menanteau et al. 2010). The table is divided into two groups of candidates: candidates detected\nat SNR > 6 and candidates detected at lesser significance. The optical follow-up showed that for candidates\ndetected at SNR > 6, the larger catalog of all SZ candidates is 100% pure (See also Section 4.). Of the nine\ndetections at SNR > 6, three are newly discovered systems. Among the fourteen candidates confirmed at lower\nSNR, seven are new detections. Thumbnails of the cluster decrements are shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe multifrequency properties of the clusters covered\nin this work are discussed at length in Hincks et al.\n(2009) and Menanteau et al. (2010). Paraphrasing these\nstudies, X-ray luminosities were computed from Chandra and XMM observations where available and supplemented by ROSAT All Sky Survey for the remaining\nclusters. These luminosities suggest that the full sample\nis composed of high mass clusters with a characteristic\nmass of M500c \u223c 6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 , where M500c is defined as\nthe mass of the cluster at five hundred times the critical density of the universe at the cluster redshift. The\nsample has a median redshift of 0.44. All but one of the\nclusters at z > 0.35 in the sample were discovered via\nthe SZ.\nOf the new ACT clusters, the most notable is ACTCL J0102-4915. This cluster has a decrement amplitude\n(\u03b4T \u2032 = \u22121046\u00b1116\u03bcK) comparable to that of the Bullet\nCluster (\u03b4T \u2032 = \u2212734\u00b164\u03bcK) as well as a smaller angular\ncore radius, consistent with its higher redshift (zphoto =\n0.75). The X-ray luminosity (0.1\u20132.4 keV) derived from\nROSAT observations is 18.39 \u00b1 6.49 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 which\nis also comparable to that of the Bullet as well as the\nother massive clusters in our sample (Menanteau et al.\n2010). The cluster richness is also consistent with that\nof a massive cluster (Ngal \u2248 50). The strength of this\ndecrement may result from merger activity, elongation\n\n\fMarriage et al.\n\nACT-CL J0102-4915\n\n600\n\n10\n\n7\n\n\u0014 540\n\n6\n\n520\n\n5\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u0016c (')\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.04\n\nT0 ( K)\n\n560\n\n5000.0\n\n160\n\n8\nSNR\n\nT0 ( K)\n\n\u0015\n\n4.4\n\n170\n\n9\n\n580\n\nACT-CL J0346-5438\n\n180\n\n\u0018\n\u0017\n\n4.2\n\n150\n\nSNR\n\n6\n\n140\n\n4.0\n\n130\n\n3.8\n\n120\n110\n1000.5\n\n3.6\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u0019c (')\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nFig. 4.- Decrement amplitude and SNR versus the filter core radius for two newly discovered clusters. The solid curve corresponds to\nthe decrement while the dotted curve corresponds to the SNR. A vertical dashed line marks the maximum SNR identified by the extraction\nalgorithm.\n\nalong the line of sight, or other decrement-enhancing effects. Planned spectroscopic and IR follow-up observations will determine the true nature of the decrement.\nTable 1 contains estimates of the cluster decrement amplitudes \u03b4T0 based upon the matched filter described in\nSection 2.2. Also listed is the core radius \u03b8c corresponding to the filter that exhibits the largest SNR for each\ncluster. Figure 4 shows the temperature decrement and\nSNR of two newly discovered clusters plotted as a function of filter scale (i.e., the core radius). For some of the\nclusters, such as ACT-CL J0346-5438 shown in the figure, the SNR is a relatively broad function of core radius.\nThe corresponding uncertainty in the size of the cluster\nresults from the blending of the cluster decrement with\nthe background (e.g., CMB). This confusion for singlefrequency data was observed by Melin et al. (2006) as\nwell as Vanderlinde et al. (2010). For clusters with a\nmore compact and pronounced core, like ACT-CL J01024915, the cluster-background confusion is smaller and so\nthe optimal filter scale is easier to determine from the\ndata. Confusion with the background inflates \u03b8c while\ncontamination by detector white noise causes a cluster\nto appear more compact than it actually is. The latter\neffect can be explained by the fact that most of the power\nin the white noise field is at the smallest scales. Simulations (See Section 4.) show contamination for clusters detected outside the range \u03b8c = 0.75\u2032 \u2212 1.75\u2032 . For\nthis reason, \u03b8c estimates reported below 0.75\u2032 or above\n1.75\u2032 are suspect. Incorporation of ACT's multiple frequencies will help distinguish clusters from background.\nAdditional years of data will help reduce the fraction of\nwhite-noise-boosted detections.\nThe \u03b4T0 recovered from the filter is the amplitude of\nthe cluster decrement in the ACT map. As such, it is the\namplitude of the intrinsic cluster profile convolved with\nthe ACT beam. In Table 1 we also include an estimate\nof the decrement \u03b4T0\u2032 = \u03b4T0 C \u22121 (\u03b8c ) where we have corrected the raw \u03b4T0 by the smearing effect of the beam on\nthe height of the corresponding \u03b2-profile. This correction for a \u03b2-profile with \u03b8c = 1\u2032 is 1.67. The correction\nis larger for smaller core radii. To estimate the uncer-\n\ntainty in the recovered \u03b4T0\u2032 , the cluster extraction algorithm was run on a simulation with realistic ACT noise,\nCMB and clusters with symmetric \u03b2-model profiles. The\nmore realistic simulations of Sehgal et al. (2010b) were\nnot used as they were not provided an estimate of the\ndecrement amplitude. As the \u03b2-model profiles in this\nsimulation are matched to our filters, the error estimate\nfrom these simulations should be taken as a lower limit.\nWith those caveats, the mean error on \u03b4T0\u2032 from the simulations is 20% greater than the statistical error inferred\nfrom the SNR (i.e., systematic errors are 40% of the total\nerror budget). This modest increase in the error budget\nwas accompanied by a large scatter in recovered scale\n(\u223c30% with respect to the input scale value) with a nonGaussian tail towards larger recovered radii. This implies\nthat while the physical scale of the cluster may be confused with the background the amplitude of the peak\nis relatively immune to this confusion. When the cluster\nextraction algorithm was run on the \u03b2-model simulations\nwith prior knowledge of the scale, the resulting scatter in\nrecovered \u03b4T0\u2032 values was consistent with the statistical\nerror inferred from the SNR. Thus we infer that, in the\nideal case of \u03b2-model cluster profiles, uncertainty in scale\nadds 20% scatter to our uncertainty in \u03b4T0\u2032 . For more\nrealistic cluster profiles (e.g., asymmetric), this scatter\nshould be larger.\nBecause the cluster counts are a falling function of\nmass (and there for of decrement amplitude), clusters detected at low significance are more likely to be lower mass\nsystems with a noise-boosted decrement than a higher\nmass system with a noise-suppressed decrement. In particular, members of the lower significance (SNR < 6)\nfraction of the ACT detections are likely to have their\n\u03b4T0\u2032 overestimated due to noise-boosting. In this work,\nno correction has been made for this bias. An additional\nbias arises from optimizing the detection significance over\nthe two celestial coordinates and \u03b8c . Vanderlinde et al.\n(2010) show that this\n\u221a latter bias, when referred to SNR,\ncan be shown to be SN R2 \u2212 3. In the case of SNR = 4,\ntherefore, the optimization over location and core radius\nincreases the raw decrement estimate by 10% on average.\n\n\fSZ-Selected Galaxy Clusters from ACT\n\nIn this equation x = h\u03bd/kB TCMB and Te is the temperature of the electron gas. In this equation, we have\nomitted the \u223c 10% contribution of the kinetic SunyaevZel'dovich (kSZ) effect which arises due to the peculiar\nvelocity of the cluster (Sunyaev & Zel'dovich 1970). Because we do not know the bulk velocity of the clusters, we\ndo not account for the contribution of the kinetic effect\nwhich adds to the uncertainty in the derived y parameter. The y parameter itself is the product of the optical\ndepth through the cluster and kB Te /me c2 where me is\nthe electron mass:\nZ\nkB Te\nne \u03c3T dl\n(4)\ny0\u2032 =\nme c2\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thomson cross section and isothermality of the cluster is assumed. The relativistic correction\n\u03b4SZE (x, Te ) at 148 GHz varies from -0.03 to -0.10 for the\nACT sample, corresponding to cluster temperatures in\nthe range 5\u201315 keV (Nozawa et al. 2006). We have used\nX-ray temperatures tabulated in Menanteau et al. (2010)\nas input to the relativistic correction for a subset of the\nclusters. For clusters without an X-ray temperature, we\nuse a correction of -0.05 which roughly corresponds to a\ntemperature of 7.5 keV, characteristic of our sample.\nFor all but one case, there is no obvious correlation of the cluster decrements with strong sources.\nThe one exception is Abell S0295. Approximately\n4\u2032 north-east of the cluster is ACT-S J024539-525756\n(Marriage et al. 2010) with a 148 GHz flux density of\n18.4 mJy (SNR=7.6). The source is also identified at\n0.84 GHz in the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) catalog (Mauch et al. 2003). Therefore\nthe source flux density is most likely dominated by synchrotron emission. From simple geometric arguments,\nthere is approximately a 10% chance that one of the the\nACT sources would randomly fall within 4\u2032 of one of\nthe twenty-three clusters, so the source-cluster proximity may be a projection effect. Furthermore, the source's\nlarge angular displacement from the cluster implies that\nit is unlikely a lensed background galaxy. Finally, note\nthat this source does not appear near Abell S0295 in Figure 3 because the source was removed from the data prior\nto filtering.\nThere are slight differences between the cluster properties as presented in Table 1 and in Menanteau et al.\n(2010). The SNR and, to a lesser degree, position differ\n\ndue primarily to two facts. First, the data reduction (i.e.,\nthe map) used for Menanteau et al. (2010) was a preliminary version of that used for this work. The map used for\nthis work corresponds to that used in Fowler et al. (2010)\nand Marriage et al. (2010). Second, the signal and noise\nterms used in the matched filter for the candidate selection in Menanteau et al. (2010) are different from those\nused in this study. These differences in analysis arose\nfrom the need to execute the optical follow-up before the\nACT pipeline and cluster extraction algorithm were fully\nmature. The differences in SNR generally correspond to\napproximately 1\u03c3 fluctuations between the reductions.\n4. SIMULATED PURITY AND COMPLETENESS\n\nIn order to assess the ratio of true detections to total\ndetections (purity) and the fraction of clusters recovered\n(completeness), we run our filtering and extraction algorithm on simulations of the ACT data. The simulations were constructed using the millimeter signal (SZ,\nCMB, etc.) from Sehgal et al. (2010b) and noise from\nACT difference maps. In order to avoid confusion due to\nsource-SZ correlations included in Sehgal et al. (2010b),\nthe source component of those simulations was not included. The undetected/unmasked sources in the data\ncontribute a small fraction of the rms of the filtered map\nwhich is dominated by white detector and photon shot\nnoise (Marriage et al. 2010).\n\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\nPurity\n\nDecrement measurements at 150 GHz have been published for a number of the known clusters in the current\nACT sample. Halverson et al. (2008) using the APEX\ntelescope reported a decrement for the Bullet Cluster\n\u2212771 \u00b1 71\u03bcK while Plagge et al.

Purity is defined as fraction of\ntrue detections in the sample. The four-pixel candidate selection, which was used to produce the sample in Menanteau et al.\n(2010), requires cluster candidates to have at least four pixels with\nSNR > 4.0. The dashed line gives the simulated purity associated\nwith the four-pixel selection function. The solid line is the purity\nfunction corresponding to a selection function based on the single\nhighest SNR cluster pixel. As expected the four-pixel purity of the\nsimulated sample is in reasonable agreement with that derived from\noptical follow-up of candidates from the data Menanteau et al.\n(2010). The sample is essentially pure at SNR > 6.\n\nAlthough it is expected that, from a noise power perspective, omitting the sources in this study will not significantly impact the analysis, there remains concern that\nmillimeter sources may be correlated with clusters, either\nas cluster members or as lensed backgrounds.

The completeness degrades at the\nedges of the map: taking the cleanest 230 sq-deg from Fowler et al.\n(2010), the completeness rises to 90%.\n\nVLA Sky Survey, Lin & Mohr (2007) found that the fraction of BCGs being radio-loud is higher compared to\nthat of cluster galaxies of similar luminosity. Extrapolating in frequency and redshift, this study concluded that\nroughly 10% of clusters may have 150 GHz decrements\n\"filled in\" by synchrotron emission from resident AGN.\nMarriage et al. (2010) included a cross-comparison of the\n150 GHz bright source population detected by ACT and\nthe 23 REFLEX X-ray clusters (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2004)\nwhich fall within the survey area. The study crossidentified three clusters with 150 GHz sources. These\nthree clusters were all at redshifts below z = 0.06 in contrast to the higher redshift sample of this work. Lensed\nbackground dusty star-forming galaxies may also contaminate the SZ signal. Wilson et al. (2008) found a\nbright, lensed, dusty source at 1.1 mm behind the Bullet\nCluster. Vieira et al. (2010) found that the lensed dusty\npopulation were characterized my maximum 150 GHz\nflux densities below 5 mJy range. This finding is consistent with the Wilson et al. (2008) bright Bullet Cluster\nlensed source flux of 15.9 mJy at 1.1 mm (\u223c 4 mJy at 150\nGHz assuming a spectral index of 2). Filtered at characteristic scale (.75') of this work, such sources would\nproduce a peak brightness of 10 \u03bcK. As the decrements\nin this work measure of order 100 \u03bcK, contributions from\ndusty sources may affect the purity and completeness of\nfaint end of the sample, but the bright end (SNR > 6)\nshould be relatively immune to detection problems due\nto dusty sources.\nIn order to build simulated catalogs to compare to\nthat from the data, we run the filtering and detection\npipeline described in Section 2.2 on each of six simulations extracted from the Sehgal et al. (2010b) sky. We\nidentify decrements with clusters from the simulated catalog with M500c > 2 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 and at redshifts z > 0.1.\nThe identification radius is 3\u2032 . This radius was chosen\nby studying significant decrements detected in the simulations and their offset from the position reported in\nthe simulated catalog. By coincidence, this is also ap-\n\nproximately the size of the optical fields of view used\nin the Menanteau et al. (2010) follow-up work. In nearly\nall cases, the arcminute scale displacements resulted from\nextended non-spherical, often double peaked, clusters. In\nthese cases it was easier for noise fluctuations to move the\ndetection position away from the minimum of the cluster\npotential as reported in the catalogs from Sehgal et al.\n(2010b).\nFigure 5 shows the purity as derived from the simulations. In order to reproduce the original selection\nfunction from Menanteau et al. (2010) we require that\na cluster candidate have four conjoined map pixels with\nSNR > 4.0. This requirement is intended to boost the\npurity of the sample with respect to a sample drawn with\nthe requirement that only a single pixel have a high SNR.\nFigure 5 shows the purity versus SNR for both of these\nselection effects. As expected, the four-pixel requirement\nincreases the purity as determined by the simulations.\nFurthermore the four-pixel purity agrees reasonably well\nwith the purity measured in Menanteau et al. (2010).\nThe simulations imply that the purity of the sample with\nSNR > 6 is 95%, consistent with the finding that all these\nclusters have optical counterparts. Furthermore, both\nthe four-pixel and single-pixel selection process yield the\nsame purity for the high SNR sample. Below SNR = 6,\nsimulations show that the four-pixel purity falls off in a\nmanner consistent with the purity determined from the\noptical follow-up. The single-pixel purity falls significantly faster with decreasing SNR compared to that of\nthe four-pixel or optically-measured purity. We therefore choose the four-pixel selection function to evaluate\nthe completeness of the sample below.\nIt is straightforward to simulate the cumulative completeness as a function of cluster mass for the pure population at SNR > 6. As shown in Figure 6 with the dashed\ncurve, we count the simulated clusters above a given mass\nand detected at SNR > 6. We then divide the number of\ndetected clusters by the total number of clusters in the\nsame mass range. The resulting cumulative completeness\nshows that the high SNR sample is approximately \u223c45%\ncomplete for M500c > 6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 and rises to 80% complete for M500c > 1.0 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 . One reason for incompleteness among the high mass population is that clusters\nat z < 0.3 are characterized by larger angular scales than\ntheir high-redshift counterparts and start blending with\nthe fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.\nDividing the simulated sample in redshift bins of \u03b4z = 0.2\nbins between z = 0.1 and z = 1.1, the completeness of this\nsample, in the mass range M500c > 6\u00d71014M\u2299 , increased\nsmoothly from 30% in the lowest redshift (z = 0.1\u20130.3)\nbin to 70% complete in the highest bin (z = 0.9\u20131.1).\nIt is not so straightforward to reproduce the cumulative completeness function for the entire sample presented in Menanteau et al. (2010) which is based on a\nprevious reduction of the data. As shown in Figure 13\nof Menanteau et al. (2010), the follow-up observations\nwere completed for a preliminary candidate list down to\nSNR = 4.2. Below SNR = 4.8, the follow-up was performed for a decreasing fraction of candidates such that,\nby SNR = 4.2, the fraction of the total candidates followed up was 50%. In order to approximately simulate\nthe smoothly declining selection function of the followup for candidates in the range SNR = 4.2-4.8, we simply\nintroduce a hard cut at SNR = 4.5 where the sampling\n\n\fSZ-Selected Galaxy Clusters from ACT\n\n5. SZ-MASS CORRELATION\n\nIn this section, we perform a largely illustrative, preliminary study of the correlation of the SZ signal with\nmass for the more significant (SNR > 5) half of the\nSZ detections. For the SZ signal we use the central y0\u2032\nas described in Section 3 and listed in Table 1. For\nthe total mass, we derive M500c using X-ray luminosities from Menanteau et al. (2010) and the Lx \u2212 M relation from Vikhlinin et al. (2009). For all clusters but\nAbell 3128(NE), the X-ray luminosities were derived\nfrom the ROSAT All Sky Survey. For Abell 3128(NE),\nthe available higher resolution Chandra results from\nMenanteau et al. (2010) were used to help separate the\nflux from the more massive background cluster from\nthe less massive cluster at low redshift (Werner et al.\n2007). An additional scale factor of \u223c 1.6 was needed\nto convert the luminosities from the 0.1-2.4 keV band\nin Menanteau et al. (2010) to the 0.5-2.0 keV band required by the correlation in Vikhlinin et al. (2009). The\nresulting M500c estimates are shown in Table 2. The\nerror given for M500c only includes statistical error propagated from error on LX . Additional scatter about this\nrelation was measured to be 48% (Vikhlinin et al. 2009).\ndue to evolution and non-trivial processes in the ICM as\nwell as Ongoing optical and X-ray follow-up of the ACT\ncluster sample will improve these mass estimates in the\nnear future.\nFor self-similar evolution, the central y0\u2032 is expected to\nscale as M E 2 (z) where E 2 (z) = \u03a9M (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b\nfor a flat \u039bCDM universe. The conventional argument\nbehind this scaling is given in Appendix A. Anticipating such a scaling, in Figure 7 we plot y0\u2032 values scaled\nby E \u22122 (z) against their corresponding M500c estimates.\nValues used for \u03a9M and \u03a9\u039b are 0.26 and 0.74, respectively (Komatsu et al. 2010). The errors plotted for y0\u2032\nare purely statistical. As discussed in Section 3, systematic errors, primarily due to uncertainty in the core\nradius, would increase the errors on y0\u2032 by at least 20%.\nBecause of systematic uncertainties associated with the\nestimators for y0\u2032 and M500c no attempt has been made\nto fit scaling relations to these data. Given this pre-\n\n4.0\n\n(z)x10\n\n4\n\n2.0\n\n2\n\n\u001d\n\n1.0\n\n0 E\n\n\u001c\n\n0.5\n\ny\n\ngoes from 100% to 0%.\nWith this prescription for modeling the entire sample,\nthe simulations suggest that \u223c80% of all clusters with\nM500c > 6\u00d71014M\u2299 are detected. Figure 6 shows the full\ncumulative completeness function with a solid curve. Unlike in the case of the high SNR sample discussed above,\nthe simulations suggest that completeness of the full sample in the range M500c > 6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 is not a strong\nfunction of redshift (z = 0.1\u20131.1). Another important\nreason for the incompleteness is that a fraction of massive clusters are disturbed, showing elongated structure\nin the plane of the sky, and thus are not well matched to\nour \u03b2-model filter. Conversely, the simulations suggest\nour sample likely includes high-redshift relaxed, spherical clusters of lower mass (e.g., 4 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 ). Another\nfeature of the data which drives the overall completeness\ndown is the high level of noise towards the edge of the\nmap. If the region under consideration is restricted to the\ncentral 230 square degrees used for the power spectrum\nstudy in Fowler et al. (2010), then the completeness estimate for clusters with M500c > 6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 increases\nto \u223c90%.\n\n9\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nc\n\nM500 (x10\n\nM\u001b\n\n0.8\n15\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n)\n\nFig. 7.- SZ-Mass Correlation. Estimated Compton y parameter\nestimates (Table 1) are plotted, scaled for self-similar evolution,\nagainst X-ray luminosity-derived mass estimates (Table 2) for the\nmore significant half (SNR > 5) of the cluster sample. The line\nplotted is the self-similar model y0\u2032 \u221d M E 2 (z) (See Appendix A.).\nThe model, which is not fit to the data, agrees reasonably well with\nthe ACT data. For comparison, the dashed line shows a simulationmotivated model with logarithmic slope 3/2 (Motl et al. 2005).\n\ncaution, however, the data appear consistent with the\nself-similar model plotted as a solid line in the figure.\nAn additional dashed line with y0\u2032 \u221d M 3/2 E 2 (z) approximates the y0 \u2212 M relation from numerical simulations\nincluding star formation and supernova feedback from\nMotl et al. (2005). The data also appear consistent with\nthis model.\nThe SZ-Mass relation presented here is for illustrative\npurposes using central y parameter estimates and a mass\nproxy that are available now for all clusters but which\nhave a large scatter. The SZ signal estimate will be improved in future analyses using additional ACT bands as\nwell as additional information on cluster gas and temperature profiles from the X-ray (e.g., Andersson et al.\n2010). The precise relationship between the SZ signal\nand mass needs to be determined from more precise mass\nproxies such as X-ray temperature, galaxy velocity dispersion, and weak lensing. This work is in progress and\nwill be reported in future publications.\n6. CONCLUSION\n\nACT has identified the SZ signatures of twenty-three\noptically-confirmed galaxy clusters at a frequency of\n148 GHz in data taken during the 2008 observing season. Of these clusters, ten are new discoveries. Together, ACT and SPT have reported twenty-five newly\ndiscovered systems. The Planck Satellite will soon add\nits complementary detections to the growing sample of\nSZ cluster discoveries. Due to the unique nature of the\nSZ effect, the sample is biased towards high-mass clusters\nat high redshifts. As such the sample complements current X-ray and optically-selected catalogues. Among the\nclusters discovered by ACT, ACT-CL J0102-4915 stands\nout as a high redshift cluster having an SZ temperature decrement comparable to that of the most massive\nknown clusters. Purity estimates from simulations of the\ncluster extraction agree with the sample purity derived\nfrom optical follow-up in Menanteau et al. (2010). The\nsimulations also estimate completeness of the sample at\nroughly 80% for M500c > 6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 . Over the same\nmass range, the completeness increases to greater than\n\n\f10\n\nMarriage et al.\n\n90% if only the lowest noise half of the survey area is considered. A comparison of the clusters' central Compton\ny parameters with X-ray luminosity-derived masses is in\nagreement with both self-similar scaling as well as scalings based on simulations which include star formation\nand supernova feedback.\nFuture work with the SZ effect from galaxy clusters will\ninclude ACT data from multiple seasons and multiple\nmillimeter bands. In addition to the southern survey\ndescribed in this work, ACT is also surveying the celestial\nequator to complement extant and future multifrequency\ncluster work in this highly accessible strip of sky.\nThe ACT project was proposed in 2000 and funded\nby the U.S. National Science Foundation on January 1,\n2004.

The total density is referenced to\nthe background critical density (\u03c1 \u221d \u03c1c ) which evolves with redshift as E 2 (z) = \u03a9M (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b in a flat \u039bCDM\nuniverse. Furthermore, the cluster radius is a function of the mass and density such that\n\u0012 \u00131/3 \u0012\n\u00131/3\nM\nM\nR\u221d\n\u221d\n.\n(A2)\n\u03c1\nE 2 (z)\nUnder the assumptions of virialization and hydrostatic equilibrium, the temperature can be related to M and E(z)\n(e.g., Bryan & Norman 1998):\nT \u221d M 2/3 E 2/3 (z).\n\n(A3)\n\ny0 \u221d M E 2 (z).\n\n(A4)\n\nCombining these relations, the central Compton y parameter is seen to scale with mass and redshift as\n\n\f"}
