In this work, we identify those three-qubit states from the set\nof the new class of W -states which are most efficient or suitable for quantum\n\u221a teleportation. We show that with some probability |W1 i = 12 (|100i + |010i + 2|001i)\nis best suited for teleportation channel in the sense that it does not depend on the\ninput state.\n\nPACS Numbers: 03.67.-a, 03.65.Bz,42.50.Dv\nQuantum teleportation [1] involves the transmission of an arbitrary qubit from one\nparty to another distant party by sending two classical bits. However they must initially share one entangled state. It can also be combined with other operations to\nconstruct advanced quantum circuits useful for information processing [2]. The first\nexperimental demonstration of quantum teleportation was reported by Bouwmeester\net.al. [3]. Quantum teleportation is also possible in systems corresponding to infinite\ndimensional Hilbert spaces [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nThe teleportation of quantum entanglement is also known as entanglement swapping\n[29, 30, 2, 4]. It enables two parties (having no common past) to share quantum entanglement. This protocol may be useful in making nonlocal correlations over long\ndistances. Therefore it can play a significant role in quantum communication.\nQuantum entanglement [12], the heart of quantum information theory, plays a crucial\nrole in computational and communicational purposes. Therefore as a valuable resource\nin quantum information processing, quantum entanglement has been widely used in\nquantum cryptography [13, 14], quantum superdense coding [15], quantum teleportation\n[1], remote state preparation of special qubits and arbitrary quantum states [16, 17], and\nteleportation of an unitary operator [18]. Along with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\n\u2217\n\nCorresponding Author: Satyabrata Adhikari, e-mail:satyabrata@bose.res.in\n\n1\n\n\f2\nstate and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, there exists other entangled states\nsuch as W -class states and zero sum amplitude (ZSA) states [19] which have substantial importance in quantum information theory. Tripartite ZSA state may be related to\nW -class state under stochastic LOCC [20].\nIn [28], it was shown that an unknown qubit can be teleported using a three particle GHZ state. Joo et.al. [21] proposed quantum key distribution (QKD) and partial\nquantum secret sharing protocols based on W -states of three qubits. Further, V.N.\nGorbachev et.al. [22] showed that in contrast to |W i = \u221a13 (|100i + |010i + |001i),\n\u221a\n|W\u0303 i = 12 ( 2|100i + |010i + |001) can be used as a quantum channel for teleportation\nof an entangled state and superdense coding. Recently, Agarwal and Pati [23] defined\na large class of W -states that can also be used as an entanglement resource for teleportation protocol and superdense coding. Therefore, keeping in mind the importance\nof W -states, there have been various proposals to prepare these states in the literature\n[24, 25, 26].\nIn this work, we estimate the efficiency of the quantum channel |Wn i defined in [23].\nTo do this we proceed in the following way. First we consider a two-qubit entangled\nstate (pure or mixed) in Alice's place. Alice then send a qubit from her entangled state\nto Bob using the special class of three-qubit quantum channel (|Wn i) shared by them.\nAfter the completion of the protocol, if it turns out that the amount of entanglement\nin Alice's two-qubit state is retained in the final two-qubit state shared by both Alice\nand Bob, then we can say that the efficiency of the teleportation channel is unity. If\nthe amount of entanglement decreases after completing the teleportation protocol then\nthe efficiency of the channel is less than unity. To quantify the above statement, we\ncompute the concurrence [27] which gives a measure of entanglement. Hence, as it goes\ntowards zero, one can say that the efficiency of the channel decreases.\nLet us consider an arbitrary two qubit state\n|\u03c8i12 = \u03b1|00i + \u03b2|11i\n\n,\n\n\u03b12 + \u03b2 2 = 1 .\n\n(1)\n\nFor simplicity we assume that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are real. As we have mentioned earlier, the\nabove two qubit entangled state is in Alice's place, i.e. Alice holds both the particles.\nThe special class of W -state is given by [23]1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(2)\n|Wn i345 = f (n)(|100i + n|010i + n + 1|001i)\nwhere, n is a positive real number and f (n) is the normalization constant given by\n1\n.\nf (n) = p\n(2 + 2n)\n\n(3)\n\nThe above three-qubit entangled state serve as a quantum channel and it is also shared\nby Alice and Bob. Let us assume that particle-3 is in Alice's possession and the remaining two particles (i.e. particles 4 and 5) are with Bob. Our task is to see the efficiency\n1\n\nOriginally there are two phase factors in |Wn i but for simplicity we have ignored them here.\n\n\f3\nof this quantum channel in the teleportation protocol.\nThe combined system of five particles can be written as a tensor product of |\u03c8i12 and\n|Wn i345 :\n|\u03c7i12345\n\n= |\u03c8i12 \u2297 |Wn i345\n\u221a\n\u221a\nf (n) h +\n= \u221a\n|\u03a6 i23 ( n\u03b1|010i145 + n + 1\u03b1|001i145 + \u03b2|100i145 )\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212\n+|\u03a6 i23 ( n\u03b1|010i145 + n + 1\u03b1|001i145 \u2212 \u03b2|100i145 )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+|\u03a8+ i23 (\u03b1|000i145 + n\u03b2|110i145 + n + 1\u03b2|101i145 )\ni\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+|\u03a8\u2212 i23 (\u03b1|000i145 \u2212 n\u03b2|110i145 \u2212 n + 1\u03b2|101i145 .\n\n(4)\n\nThereafter, Alice performs the measurement on the qubits 2 and 3 in the Bell-basis\n{|\u03a6+ i, |\u03a6\u2212 i, |\u03a8+ i, |\u03a8\u2212 i}. If the measurement outcome is |\u03a6\u00b1 i23 , then it indicates\n\u221a\nthat\n\u221a the five-qubit state |\u03c7i12345 collapsed to the three-qubit state ( n\u03b1 |010i145 +\nn + 1\u03b1 |001i145 \u00b1 \u03b2 |100i145 ). Alice then sends the measurement result to her partner\nBob by spending two classical bits. After receiving the classical message from Alice,\nBob performs a von-Neumann measurement on the qubit-5 in the computational basis {|0i, |1i}. As a result of this one-qubit measurement, the three-qubit state reduces\nto two-qubit state. Without any loss of generality, let us assume that von-Neumann\nmeasurement outcome is |0i5 . Then the reduced two-qubit state is of the following form\n\u221a\n(5)\n|\u03bei14 = N ( n\u03b1|01i \u00b1 \u03b2|10i)\nwhere, N = \u221a\n\n1\n.\nn\u03b12 +\u03b2 2\n\nNow our task is to calculate the entanglement between the particles 1 and 4. This\ncalculation of the entanglement gives us insight about the efficiency of the quantum\nchannel |Wn i in the teleportation protocol.\nTo do this, we recall that the concurrence of a pure state of two qubits is defined as [27]\nC(|\u03b7i) = |h\u03b7|\u03b7\u0303i|\n\n(6)\n\nwhere, |\u03b7\u0303i denotes the spin flip of two-qubit pure state and is defined by\n|\u03b7\u0303i = (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )|\u03b7 \u2217 i\n\n(7)\n\nwith |\u03b7 \u2217 i being the complex conjugate of |\u03b7i when it is expressed in the computational\nbasis {|0i, |1i} and\n\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y = |11ih00| \u2212 |01ih10| \u2212 |10ih01| + |00ih11| .\n\n(8)\n\nWith the above definitions at our disposal, we compute the concurrence for the state\n|\u03bei14 (5) and get\n\"\n#\np\n\u221a\nn\n2\u03b1 n(1 \u2212 \u03b12 )\n= C(|\u03c8i12 )\nC(|\u03bei14 ) =\n(9)\n(n \u2212 1)\u03b12 + 1\n(n \u2212 1)\u03b12 + 1\n\n\f4\n\u221a\nwhere, C(|\u03c8i12 ) = 2\u03b1 1 \u2212 \u03b12 .\nNote that the concurrence C(|\u03bei14 ) depends on the input entangled state parameter \u03b1\nand n. For any fixed real positive number n, it can be easily observed that as \u03b12 varies\nfrom 0 to 1, the concurrence first increases (from C(|\u03bei14 ) = 0), attains the maximum\nvalue (C(|\u03bei14 ) = 1) and again decreases to zero.\nNext we make the following interesting observations for the case when Alice gets the\nBell-state measurement result |\u03a6\u00b1 i23 and Bob gets the von-Neumann measurement\nresult |0i :\n1. For n = 1, the final concurrence C(|\u03bei14 ) (i.e. concurrence after completing the\nprotocol) is exactly equal to the initial concurrence C(|\u03c8i12 ). This means |W1 i serve\nas the best teleportation channel for any arbitrary input state (1). For n 6= 1, one can\nonce again have\u221a C(|\u03bei14 ) = C(|\u03c8i12 ) for some specific states with parameter \u03b1 taking\nn\u22121\n.\nthe form \u03b12 = n\u22121\n2. There also exist other three-qubit quantum channels |Wn i (which can be used for\nteleportation) for which C(|\u03bei14 ) < C(|\u03c8i12 ) and hence are not as much efficient as\nthe state independent quantum\nchannel |W1 i or the state dependent quantum channels\n\u221a\nn\u22121\n2\n|Wn i (n 6= 1) with \u03b1 = n\u22121 . We now classify those states as follows :\n(i) For 0 < n < 1, the range for \u03b12 is given by 0 < \u03b12 <\n(ii)For n > 1, the range for \u03b12 is given by\n\n\u221a\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n\n\u221a\nn\u22121\nn\u22121 .\n\n< \u03b12 < 1.\n\nApart from the above observations, we also note that whatever be the Bell-state measurement result (obtained by Alice on qubits 2 and 3), the final concurrence (i.e. the\nentanglement of the final state) vanishes if Bob gets the von-Neumann measurement\nresult |1i5 . This indicates that the special class of W -states does not act as a good\nteleportation channel at all. Furthermore, the concurrence of the final state (when\nthe Bell-state measurement result of Alice is |\u03a8\u00b1 i23 followed by Bob's von-Neumann\nmeasurement result |0i5 ) is given by :\n\"\n#\np\n\u221a\nn\n2\u03b2 n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\nC(|\u03bei14 ) =\n= C(|\u03c8i12 )\n.\n(10)\n(n \u2212 1)\u03b2 2 + 1\n(n \u2212 1)\u03b2 2 + 1\n\nNext we extend our idea to the case of mixed state. We want to investigate the performance of |Wn i as a teleportation channel when teleporting a single-qubit mixed state.\nIn particular, we start with the family of Werner state which is of the form\n1\u2212p\nI\n\u03c112 = p |\u03a6+ ih\u03a6+ | +\n4\uf8f6\n\uf8eb (1+p)\np\n0\n0\n4\n2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(1\u2212p)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n0\n4\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\n(11)\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n(1\u2212p)\n0\n0\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0\n4\n(1+p)\np\n0\n0\n2\n4\nNote that the concurrence of the above state is C(\u03c112 ) = (3p\u22121)/2. Now considering the\nabove state (11) as an input state and then teleporting a qubit from it using the same\n\n\f5\nprocedure discussed for pure state, we measure the efficiency of the quantum channel\n|Wn i by computing the concurrence. Based on the two-particle followed by one-particle\nmeasurement results, we discuss the following two cases below:\nCase I: If the Bell-state measurement outcome is |\u03a6\u00b1 i23 and the von-Neumann measurement result is |0i5 , then after completion of the teleportation protocol, the two-qubit\nstate will read\n\n\u03c114\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(1\u2212p)\n8\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nn(1+p)\n8\n\u221a\n\u00b1 np\n4\n\n\u221a\n\u00b1 np\n4\nn(1+p)\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\nn(1\u2212p)\n8\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(12)\n\nThe concurrence for the above state described by the density matrix \u03c114 is therefore\ngiven by\nC(\u03c114 ) =\n\n(\n\n\u221a\n4 n(3p\u22121)\n(n+1)2\n\n\u221a\n\n8 n\n= C(\u03c112 ) (n+1)\n2 ,\n\n=0,\n\nif p > 31\nif p \u2264 31 .\n\n(13)\n\nNow since C(\u03c114 ) \u2264 C(\u03c112 ), hence we have the following inequality satisfied by n\nn4 + 4n3 + 6n2 \u2212 60n + 1 \u2265 0.\n\n(14)\n\nThe above relation explicitly gives us information about those three-qubit quantum\nchannels |Wn i which can be used as a teleportation channel for family of Werner states\nwith parameter p > 31 . If the inequality (14) becomes an equality then it provides us\ninformation about the quantum channel with unit efficiency . If p \u2264 13 , then it can be\neasily checked that the concurrence vanishes and hence the |Wn i quantum channel fails\nto teleport.\nCase II: If the Bell-state measurement outcome is |\u03a8\u00b1 i23 and the von-Neumann measurement result is |0i5 , then after completion of the teleportation protocol, the two-qubit\nstate will read\n\n\u03c1\u203214\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(1+p)\n8\n\n0\n0\n\u221a\n\n\u00b1 np\n4\n\n0\nn(1\u2212p)\n8\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n(1\u2212p)\n8\n\n0\n\n\u221a\n\u00b1 np\n4\n\n0\n0\nn(1+p)\n8\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(15)\n\nIn this case, the concurrence is exactly equal to the concurrence given in equation (13)\nand hence the fact about the quantum channel |Wn i remains the same as in Case I.\nBut unlike the above two cases, we observe that for any Bell-state measurement made\nby Alice on qubits 2 and 3, if the von-Neumann measurement result (made by Bob)\nis |1i5 , then the concurrence of the resultant state vanishes and hence once again the\n\n\f6\n|Wn i-state fails to act as a teleportation channel.\nTo summarize, we have presented a protocol that measures the efficiency of the class\nof W -state defined in [23]. We observe that there exists two types of |Wn i-state which\ncan serve as a quantum channel for entanglement swapping. They can be classified as:\n(i) State independent channel and (ii) State dependent channel. |W1 i is regarded as a\nstate independent channel because with some probability it helps in swapping the initial\nentanglement to the final two-qubit state for any arbitrary two-qubit input states. On\nthe other hand, there exist quantum channels which retains the initial entanglement in\nthe final two-qubit state only for few input two-qubit states. Hence we call these type\nof channels as state dependent channel. We finally extend our analysis to the mixed\nstate also.\n\nReferences\n[1] C. H.
