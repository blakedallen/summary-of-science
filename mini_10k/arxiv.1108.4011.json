INTRODUCTION\n\nThe neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm (1420.405752 MHz) spinflip transition has long been employed as an emission line\ntracer of the neutral gas content, surface density profile, kinematics, and dark matter halos of spiral galaxy disks in the\nlocal universe. HI 21 cm absorption, however, is rarely observed at low redshift outside of the Galaxy because it relies\non the chance alignment of a bright radio source with foreground gas, and the covering fraction of cold neutral gas is\nlow. The very slow Einstein rate coefficient for spontaneous\nemission, A21cm = 2.87 \u00d7 10\u221215 s\u22121 , means that a detectable\n21 cm line requires either a large gas mass for emission or\na high column density for absorption; the latter operationally\nlimits HI 21 cm absorption line studies to damped systems\n(NHI > 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ). But the comoving density of Damped\nLy\u03b1 (DLA) absorption systems is only dN/dz = 0.045\u00b10.006\nper unit redshift at z = 0 (Zwaan et al. 2005), so identifying\nsuch systems in the local universe (z . 0.1) requires examination of many hundreds of sightlines. If they can be found,\nHI 21 cm absorption lines complement emission lines; while\n1 Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy, Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences, University of Colorado, 389 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309-0389; jdarling@colorado.edu.\n2 NASA Lunar Science Institute, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA.\n3 Institute for Gravitational Research, School of Physics and Astronomy, Kelvin Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK G12 8QQ;\ne.macdonald@physics.gla.ac.uk.\n4 Center for Radiophysics and Space Research, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA; haynes@astro.cornell.edu, riccardo@astro.cornell.edu.\n5 National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, Cornell University,\nIthaca, NY 14853, USA.

HI\n21 cm absorption line surveys can potentially identify primordial atomic gas, infalling or out-going gas in the vicinity of\ngalaxies, or spiral disks themselves in a distance- and dust\nextinction-independent fashion.\nThe Arecibo6 Legacy Fast Arecibo L-Band Feed Array\n(ALFALFA) Survey is a 7000 deg2 extragalactic HI 21 cm\nemission line survey. Compared to the HI Parkes All Sky\nSurvey (HIPASS; Meyer et al. 2004), the ALFALFA survey\nis 8 times more sensitive, has 4 times the angular resolution,\n3 times the spectral resolution, and a factor of 1.4 more bandwidth (Giovanelli et al. 2005), and provides the first data set\napproaching the sensitivity and areal coverage required for a\ntruly \"blind\" HI 21 cm absorption line search. Such a search is\neffectively a search for DLAs that does not rely on UV-bright\nquasar sightlines (and thus can detect dusty DLAs).\nIn this paper, we describe the ALFALFA HI 21 cm absorption pilot survey, a test of the notion that damped Ly\u03b1\nsystems can be detected \"blindly\" in the local Universe in\na shallow, large area spectroscopic survey for HI emission\nfrom galaxies. We present the methods and results of our\nsurvey, along with follow-up observations conducted at the\nGreen Bank Telescope7 (GBT), and demonstrate that it is possible to place meaningful upper limits on the column density\nfrequency distribution function.

SEARCHING FOR ABSORPTION LINES IN THE ALFALFA\nSURVEY\n\nThe ALFALFA survey offers the combined sensitivity, areal\ncoverage, and redshift span to make a \"blind\" HI 21 cm absorption line search feasible and astrophysically interesting.\nThe complete ALFALFA survey will cover \u223c7000 deg2 and\nis expected to detect more than 25,000 galaxies in HI 21 cm\nemission (Giovanelli et al. 2005). The data products of the\nsurvey are dual-polarization 2.4\u25e6 \u00d72.4\u25e6 1024-channel spectral data cubes spanning 25 MHz each. There are four spectrally overlapping cubes per sky position spanning the range\n\u22122000 < cz < 17, 900 km s\u22121 (Giovanelli et al. 2005). The\nrms noise per spectral channel after smoothing to 10 km s\u22121\nis 2.2 mJy (Saintonge 2007).\nOur ALFALFA HI absorption pilot survey examines a 517\ndeg2 subset of the mature ALFALFA data product in the\nnorthern Virgo Cluster region, spanning 10.9h < \u03b1 < 14.95h\nand +7.7\u25e6 < \u03b4 < +16.3\u25e6 (122 spectral cubes). We omit a 1.6\ndeg2 region centered on M 87; the strong radio source in M 87\n(220 Jy at 1.4 GHz) creates spectral standing waves that render this region inaccessible to weak line spectroscopy with\nArecibo (Giovanelli et al. 2007).\nFigure 1 shows the survey area and distribution of radio\nsources with 8.4 mJy < S(1.4 GHz) < 5.3 Jy. We searched a\nvelocity range \u2212650 km s\u22121 < cz < 17, 500 km s\u22121 , with notable gaps due to radio frequency interference or Galactic HI\nemission at cz = 0, 2200, 3300, and 8800 km s\u22121 of about\n200 km s\u22121 width plus a large gap at 15,000\u201316,000 km s\u22121\n(Giovanelli et al. 2007). The gaps in the spectral coverage\nrender \u223c10% of the velocity range unsearchable. The net\nsearch covers \u2206z = 0.054 along each line of sight plus the\nrange \u2212650 km s\u22121 < cz < \u2212100 km s\u22121 . This translates into a\ncomoving path length of \u2206X = 0.05718.\nOur line search relies on the optimized matched filter detection methods developed by Saintonge (2007): we multiply\nthe continuum-subtracted data cubes by \u22121 and run the linefinding algorithm as if we were searching for narrow Gaussian\nHI emission lines. Saintonge (2007) obtains matched filter\n8 We assume a \u03a9 = 0.73 and \u03a9 = 0.27 cosmology (Komatsu et al. 2011).\nm\n\u039b\nMaking no assumptions about global curvature,\np \u03a9k = 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b \u2212 \u03a9m , the coR z2\nmoving path length is \u2206X = z dz(1 + z)2 / (1 + z)2 (1 + z\u03a9m ) \u2212 z(z + 2)\u03a9\u039b .\n1\nWe use the \u2206X quantity only in the calculation of the column density frequency distribution function (Sec. 5); otherwise, \u2206z is used to describe the\nsurvey.\n\n(not single-channel) signal-to-noise (S/N) thresholds for both\nreliability (detections are reliably not spurious) and completeness (all lines are detected) of 5.5 and 6.5, respectively, for\nnarrow lines in the ALFALFA survey. Our absorption line\nsearch used the conventional ALFALFA matched filter S/N of\n4.6 to search for lines with central depth greater than 7.7 mJy\ntoward continuum9 sources with flux densities greater than\n8.4 mJy (this continuum threshold corresponds to a line center optical depth of 2.5 and a neutral hydrogen column density\nof 1.4 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 assuming hydrogen spin [21 cm line excitation] temperature Ts = 100 K, a source covering fraction f of\nunity, and a 30 km s\u22121 FWHM line width). We chose this continuum threshold to allow for the possibility of detecting very\nlarge column densities; while expected to be very rare, the\nnumber of sources probing such regimes on the sky is large.\nOur low S/N threshold does identify many spurious absorption lines, which we subsequently assess using five criteria:\n(1) association with NVSS radio sources (the 45\u2032\u2032 NVSS beam\nis well-matched to the 1\u2032 ALFALFA pixels); (2) similar line\nproperties in both linear polarizations; (3) unresolved angular size; (4) no association with radio frequency interference;\nand (5) no association with spectral standing waves. Possible\nabsorption lines that meet these criteria were subsequently reobserved with the GBT (Section 3).\nThe vast majority of lines detected using our S/N threshold of 4.6 were obviously spurious, in large part because we\nwere searching below the reliability threshold. For the calculation of column density statistics (Section 5), we require\nconfidence that detected lines are real (reliability) and that a\nnon-detection is in fact a non-detection (completeness), so we\nimpose the more severe S/N cut of 6.5, corresponding to the\nSaintonge (2007) estimate of the 90% completeness limit. For\nthe gaussian narrow line template with FWHM of 30 km s\u22121 ,\nthis corresponds to a line peak of 11.0 mJy. Allowing for\nopaque lines, we make a continuum cut at the same level.\nFor the full line search, there are 8983 radio sources with\nS(1.4 GHz) > 8.4 mJy, but for the restricted column density statistics, we reduced the sample to 7296 sources with\nS(1.4 GHz) > 11.0 mJy. The distribution of continua for the\nfull sample is shown in Figure 2.\nSupplemental observations were required for two samples: candidate HI absorption systems, and strong continuum sources.

But in the meantime, it was necessary to observe\nstrong continuum sources, S(1.4 GHz) > 220 mJy, individually (Section 3). The strong sources in our sample span the\nrange 220 mJy< S(1.4 GHz) < 5.3 Jy (and exclude M 87 at\n220 Jy), but the majority fall in the range 220\u2013500 mJy.\n3. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nWe observed 13 candidate absorption systems and 250\n\"strong\" sources (NVSS flux density greater than 220 mJy)\nwith the GBT in April through August, 2008. The GBT is\nparticularly well-suited to weak spectral line detection toward\nstrong continuum sources thanks to its unblocked aperture.\nObservations of all sources were designed to mimic the spectral resolution, spectral coverage, and sensitivity of the ALFALFA survey.\nFor the follow-up observations of line candidates, we observed for a total of 10 minutes on-source in a 5-minute\nposition-switched mode using two linear polarizations, 9level sampling, 6-second records, and a 50 MHz bandwidth\ncentered on the tentative line. The strong sources were observed in a search mode using two overlapping 50 MHz bands\nspanning 95 MHz from 1335.4 to 1430.4 MHz (cz = \u22122090 to\n19,080 km s\u22121 ) for 5 minutes on-source with a reference \"Off\"\nspectrum recorded roughly every fifth source. We used two\nlinear polarizations, 9-level sampling, and 3-second records.\nFor all observations, a calibration diode signal was injected\nfor half of each record.\nEach individual off-source-flattened and calibrated spectral\nrecord was manually examined and flagged for RFI, then averaged in time and polarization. After polynomial baseline\nsubtraction, we achieved 1.3 mJy rms noise in 10.4 km s\u22121\nchannels (at 1400 MHz) toward the candidate absorbers after Hanning and Gaussian smoothing and averaging polarizations. We reached 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 mJy rms noise toward the\n151 strong sources with continua in the range 220\u2013370 mJy,\n2.5 \u00b1 0.3 mJy toward the 83 sources of 370\u20131000 mJy, 2.8 \u00b1\n0.3 mJy toward the 12 sources of 1.0\u20132.0 Jy, and 4.3\u00b11.2 mJy\ntoward the 4 sources of 2.0\u20135.3 Jy (the quoted uncertainties\nspan the range of rms noise values in each source grouping). All GBT data reduction and analysis was performed\nwith GBTIDL10 .\n4.

Each\ncolumn density bin indicates the lower bound on the column density detectable toward the sources in that bin. This distribution represents the reliable and complete sample with a flux density cut of S(1.4 GHz) > 11 mJy\n(as opposed to the 8.4 mJy cut for the sources displayed in Figures 1 and\n2). The black, blue, and red histograms indicate the distributions for spin\ntemperature modulo covering factor (Ts / f ) values of 100, 500, and 1000 K,\nrespectively.\n\n4.1. Column Density Limits\nWe made no new detections of HI 21 cm absorption (intrinsic or intervening) in the pilot survey: no ALFALFA absorption line candidates were confirmed by GBT observations,\nand no strong sources observed with the GBT show absorption lines. Despite the lack of new detections, the uniform\ndata set and large number of continuum sources in the survey allow us to place limits on the column density frequency\ndistribution function f (N, X) (Section 5). Each non-detection\nof HI absorption toward a radio continuum source places an\nupper limit on the HI column density of\n\nN(HI) < 1.8 \u00d7 1018 (Ts / f ) 1.064 FWHM * \u03c4 cm\u22122\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the limit on optical depth is set by S/N= 6.5 corresponding to the completeness limit,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n11 mJy\n,\n(2)\n\u03c4 < \u2212 ln 1 \u2212\nS(1.4 GHz)\nand we assume the minimum FWHM matched filter template\nline width used for the search, 30 km s\u22121 . For the strong\nsources observed independently at the GBT, we adjust the\n11 mJy line limit above according to the rms noise: it is unchanged for the 220\u2013370 mJy sources (2.2 mJy rms), but increases to 28 mJy for the strongest source at 5.3 Jy. We can\ngenerally detect any DLA toward the strong sources. Figure\n3 shows the redshift path searched for each column density\nlimit.\nFor a source covering fraction of unity and a spin temperature Ts = 100 K, the total redshift interval sensitive to\nall damped Ly\u03b1 (DLA) systems (NHI \u2265 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ) is\n\u2206z = 7.0 (129 objects); for super-DLAs (NHI \u2265 2 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 )\nit is \u2206z = 128.2 (2353 objects). The lowest detectable column\ndensity under these assumptions is 3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (but see Figure 3).\n4.2. Re-detection of Intrinsic HI Absorption in UGC 6081\n\nWe have re-detected the strong intrinsic HI absorption line\nin the interacting system UGC 6081 at cz \u2243 10, 800 km s\u22121 ,\npreviously detected by Bothun & Schommer (1983) and\nWilliams & Brown (1983). Gaussian fits to the ALFALFA HI\nabsorption spectrum (Figure 4) are listed in Table 1. A twocomponent fit produces a residual spectrum nearly consistent\n\n\fDarling, Macdonald, Haynes, & Giovanelli\n\nwith the rms noise (a three-component fit is not warranted by\nthe data).\nUGC 6081 lies in a region not covered by IRAS, but it does\nappear in the 2MASS catalog as multiple sources (Ks = 12.8\u2013\n13.5, Skrutskie et al. 2006) and is likely a luminous infrared\ngalaxy (LIRG). Despite the strong HI absorption, the main\n18 cm OH lines were not detected in this system at the level\nof 5.2 mJy rms in 9 km s\u22121 channels (Kaz\u00e8s & Dickey 1985).\nThe FIRST survey resolves this system into two radio sources:\nthe NW component is the stronger at 140.3(0.1) mJy; the SE\ncomponent has an integrated flux density of 30.8(0.1) mJy\n(White et al. 1997, Figure 5). Bothun & Schommer (1983)\nand Williams & Brown (1983) assumed that the radio continuum was a single source and incorrectly used the aggregate flux density at 1370 or 1400 MHz to compute the optical depth and HI column density. Since no interferometric\nspectral line observations have been conducted of this system to date, and the 16\u2032\u2032 separation of the two continuum\nsources is not resolved by the ALFALFA survey (the ALFA\nbeam is 3.3\u2032 \u00d73.8\u2032), the source(s) of the HI absorption remains\nsomewhat ambiguous. Note that the measured redshifts of the\ntwo merging components are consistent with both HI absorption lines and cannot resolve the HI provenance (Geller et al.\n1984). The stronger HI component must originate in the\nstronger (NW) component of UGC 6081 because the line is\ndeeper than the flux density of the SE continuum source. The\nweaker, blueshifted HI component, however, could arise in\neither radio continuum source. We compute optical depths\nassuming that all HI absorption originates in the NW radio\nsource, and we obtain a very large total HI column density of\nN(HI) = 1.13(1) \u00d7 1022 (Ts /100 K) (1/ f ) cm\u22122 by direct integration of the observed spectrum (rather than from the Gaussian fits). This column density is a factor of 1.4 and 2.8 larger\nthan the values obtained by Williams & Brown (1983) and\nBothun & Schommer (1983), respectively, due in large part\nto larger and confused continua employed in the previous calculation of optical depths. Note that if Ts > 100 K, f < 1, or\nthe blue line were associated with the SE component, then the\nalready very large column density would be even larger.\nOur re-detection of HI absorption in UGC 6081 illustrates\nthe power of the ALFALFA survey - designed as an HI emission line survey - to detect HI absorption (intrinsic and intervening) in a new completely \"blind\" survey mode.\n5. ANALYSIS\n\nWe compute the column density frequency distribution\nfunction f (NHI , X) following Cooksey et al. (2010) using the\nlimiting column density sensitivity estimates shown in Figure\n3:\n\u03bbmax\nf (NHI , X) <\n(3)\n\u2206NHI \u2206X\nwhere \u03bbmax is the Poisson upper limit on the detection rate of\nabsorption systems with column density NHI in interval \u2206NHI\nand \u2206X is the comoving absorption path length searched. In\nthis case, the search interval is uniform for all sources, so\n\u2206X = \u03b4X nsens , where \u03b4X = 0.0571 is the corrected redshift interval \u03b4z = 0.0545, and nsens is the number of sources toward\nwhich observations were sensitive enough to detect a column\ndensity equal to or greater than NHI (Figure 3 shows the nearly\nidentical quantity \u2206z = \u03b4z nsens versus the column density sensitivity). A 95% confidence upper limit on the Poisson rate is\n\u03bbmax = 3.00 when no detections are made.\nFigure 6 shows the column density frequency distribution\n\nF IG . 4.- HI absorption spectrum of UGC 6081. The dotted lines show\nthe two Gaussian fits to the spectrum, and the upper spectrum shows the\nresidual spectrum (data\u2212model) offset by +15 mJy for clarity.

Red, green, and blue correspond to Sloan z, i, and r. The\nALFA beam is larger than the displayed image, but the centroid of the line is\nwell-matched to the continuum sources.\n\n95% confidence limits calculated for a range of Ts / f values,\nbut in each case a single value is assumed for the entire survey.\nTo address this, we also calculated the 95% confidence limits\non f (NHI , X) for 1000 trials in which Ts / f is uniformly randomly distributed for each sight line in the range 100\u20131000 K.\nFigure 7 compares the result of a randomly distributed Ts / f to\nthe mean of the distribution (550 K), showing little difference\nbetween the two distributions except in the lowest column\ndensity bins. This demonstrates that despite the unconstrained\nnature of the spin temperature and covering factor, a distribution of values is well-represented in the f (NHI , X) upper limit\nlocus by a mean value. Also, although Ts / f is unconstrained\nsource-by-source, the prior on this quantity can still produce a\nuseful constraint on f (NHI , X), increasingly so as surveys get\nlarger or more sensitive (Section 6).

The dash-dot\nline shows the gamma distribution fit for DLAs in z = 0 galaxies mapped in\nHI 21 cm emission by Zwaan et al. (2005). The black, blue, and red upper\nlimits assume spin temperatures modulo covering factor (Ts / f ) of 100, 500,\nand 1000 K, respectively. The effect of increasing spin temperature is to shift\nthe locus down and to the right because the column density increases linearly\nwith Ts (Eqn. 1).\n\nf (NHI , X) distributions from the Zwaan et al.

(2009) and show them to be consistent in\nall cases.\nThe calculation of f (NHI , X) is influenced by the choice\nof column density interval \u2206NHI because we are calculating\nupper limits: the numerator in Equation 3 is independent of\nthe number of sources whereas the denominator grows with\n\u2206NHI . We chose \u2206NHI = 0.5 dex as a compromise between\ngood statistics in most bins and resolution of f (NHI , X) along\nthe column density axis, but it should be borne in mind that\nthese limits do depend on this choice. With coarser sampling, f (NHI , X) moves lower but does not become inconsistent with the fits to f (NHI , X) obtained by Zwaan et al. (2005),\nProchaska & Wolfe (2009), and Noterdaeme et al. (2009).\nThe column density sensitivity is proportional to the combination of factors FWHM*Ts / f ; if this quantity decreases, the\nsources are redistributed into lower column bins, driving the\nf (NHI , X) values lower. A line FWHM smaller than the assumed 30 km s\u22121 is likely in many DLAs, suggesting that an\naverage value of Ts / f = 100 K is probably too low (Figure 6).\nA source of systematic uncertainty in our calculation of\nf (NHI , X) is the unknown redshift distribution of the illuminating radio sources. We have assumed for this analysis that\nall radio sources lie at cz > 17, 500 km s\u22121 , but there are\n\nF IG . 7.- The column density frequency distribution function, f (NHI , X),\ncalculated from a uniform random distribution of spin temperatures (modulo covering factor) in the range Ts / f = 100\u20131000 K.

The long-dashed line indicates the broken power law fit by\nProchaska & Wolfe (2009) for absorption systems at z = 2\u20134, and the dotted\nline indicates a revised fit by Noterdaeme et al. (2009). The dash-dot line\nshows the gamma distribution fit for DLAs in z = 0 galaxies mapped in HI\n21 cm emission by Zwaan et al. (2005).\n\ncertainly cases to the contrary (e.g., UGC 6081). This error operates in one direction: it diminishes the total redshift\nsearch path of the survey, driving our f (NHI , X) limit upward.\nThe size of this effect, however, is very small: using the redshift distribution of NVSS sources with S(1.4 GHz) > 10 mJy\ndetermined by Brookes et al. (2008) and fit by de Zotti et al.\n(2010), we calculate that no more than about 60 sources in the\n517 deg2 pilot survey lie within the observed redshift range,\nwhich is 0.8% of the sample. The redshift distribution of these\nsources will also be skewed toward the high redshift side of\nthe survey, so the effect of this incomplete redshift coverage\nis truly negligible.\nSince we obtain only upper limits on the column density\nfrequency distribution f (NHI , X), its moments, such as the HI\nmass density (\u03c1HI or equivalently \u03a9HI ) and the comoving covering fraction l(X), are dominated by the endpoint limits and\nthus not well constrained by our observations. It is likely that\nsuch moments can be computed from future surveys (Section\n6.1). Our lack of detections is perfectly consistent with expectations and recent work on damped Ly\u03b1 lines and HI 21 cm\nemission (Section 6).\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nOur upper limits on the column density frequency distribution function are consistent with previous determina-\n\n\f6\n\nDarling, Macdonald, Haynes, & Giovanelli\n\ntions of f (NHI , X), both at high redshift (Prochaska & Wolfe\n2009; Noterdaeme et al. 2009, via Ly\u03b1 absorption) and low\n(Zwaan et al. 2005, via HI 21 cm emission). Figures 6 and 7\nshow that an expanded survey would either start making absorption line detections or will place a strong statistical limit\non the hydrogen spin temperature to source covering fraction\nratio (Ts / f ). We suspect that it will be the latter, but in any\ncase, our results provide strong motivation for a more sensitive or a larger area survey. For example, a search for absorption lines in the full ALFALFA survey would increase the\ncomoving search path \u2206X by a factor of 14 (1.15 dex) in each\nNHI bin, which will place the f (NHI , X) 95% confidence limits in conflict with previous measurements of the distribution\nover the range 1020 cm\u22122 . NHI . 1022 cm\u22122 unless either\nDLAs are detected or Ts / f & 500 K on average.\nClearly a more productive approach to obtain the column\ndensity frequency distribution f (NHI , X) at z = 0 is via HI\n21 cm emission lines (e.g., Zwaan et al. 2005), but beyond\nz\u223c 0.2, where the emission line flux density becomes prohibitively weak for anything less than a square kilometer of\ncollecting area, one would use a distance-independent absorption line survey such as the pilot survey presented here. Furthermore, \"blind\" 21 cm-based detections of DLAs can identify dusty sightlines that would otherwise be missed by optical/UV surveys, which is key to identifying exceptionally rare\nmolecular absorption systems and addressing the fraction of\ndusty DLAs.\n6.1. Future Surveys\n\nAs Figures 3, 6, and 7 demonstrate, even incremental improvements in survey sensitivity would lead to large improvements in column density sensitivity and statistics because the\nsource population grows as a power law as the 1.4 GHz flux\ndensity decreases (Figure 2). But for strong sources, which\nprovide probes of low column density, areal coverage remains\nimportant.\nThe first step should be to search the full ALFALFA survey\nfor 21 cm absorption lines; this pilot survey covered 7% of\nthe full survey, so an order of magnitude increase in search\npath is possible using extant data. This will either produce\ndetections of intervening absorption line systems or lower the\nlimits on the column density frequency distribution function,\nindicating a statistical lower bound on spin temperature (modulo covering fraction). It is already clear from Figure 6 that\nthe typical spin temperature of HI gas at z \u223c 0 cannot be less\nthan Ts / f \u2243 100 K.\nFuture facilities that could perform commensal or dedicated\n21 cm absorption line surveys include Square Kilometer Array (SKA) prototypes, including the 256-element Allen Telescope Array, the SKA Molonglo Prototype, the Australian\nSKA Pathfinder, and the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT),\nas well as Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Dark Ages telescopes, such as a lunar far-side array, the Low Frequency\nArray (LOFAR), the Precision Array to Probe the EoR, and\nthe Murchison Widefield Array. These facilities will provide\nvarious combinations of areal coverage, bandwidth (\u03b4z per\nsource), and sensitivity. As we have demonstrated here, sensitivity is key because it determines the number of sightlines\navailable per solid angle of sky surveyed, and the power-law\nincrease in radio source counts with decreasing flux density\nmeans that even slight improvements in sensitivity will lead to\nlarge gains in the size of absorption line surveys. Bandwidth\nand areal coverage, in comparison, grow absorption line sur-\n\nveys linearly.\nWhile absorption line detection is distance independent,\nwhich is an enormous advantage over redshifted emission line\nsurveys, future HI absorption line surveys will have to contend with the issue of unknown redshifts of the continuum\npopulation and the loss of foreground sources in the total redshift search path.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nOur \"blind\" pilot survey for HI 21 cm absorption lines\nin a 517 deg2 section of the ALFALFA survey spanning\n\u2212650 km s\u22121 < cz < 17, 500 km s\u22121 detected no new absorption line systems, but re-detected the intrinsic absorption in\nUGC 6081. We calculate column density sensitivity limits\ntoward a sample of 7296 radio sources and construct upper limit envelopes for the column density frequency distribution function f (NHI , X) that are consistent with previous work at high and low redshift (e.g., Zwaan et al. 2005;\nProchaska & Wolfe 2009; Noterdaeme et al. 2009). Our results suggest that higher redshift, larger solid angle, larger\nbandwidth, and especially more sensitive surveys will be an\nastrophysically worthwhile pursuit in terms of constraining\nthe 21 cm spin temperature and detecting dusty damped Ly\u03b1\nsystems as well as DLAs toward optically faint but radioloud illumination sources. A subset of these HI 21 cm absorption systems will also host the exceptionally rare and elusive molecular absorption systems, which can be employed to\nstudy cold molecular gas at high redshift and to constrain the\ncosmic evolution of fundamental physical constants.\nThe authors thank the many members of the ALFALFA\nteam who have contributed to the acquisition and processing\nof the ALFALFA data set, especially Amelie Saintonge and\nBrian Kent for the software they developed for general implementation within in the ALFALFA data processing software package.
