In some scenarios, the bits\nare kept secret from an eavesdropper while in others, they are kept secret from the participants\nthemselves. Perhaps the simplest such example is the quantum generalization of the one-time\npad, known as a private quantum channel [1, 2]. In this setting, two parties make use of shared\nrandom bits to create a secure quantum channel between them. In this case, the message is kept\nsecret from an eavesdropper with access to the output of the quantum channel. In contrast, the\ngoal in quantum secret sharing [3] is to share a secret, in the form of classical or quantum bits, between many parties. Certain prescribed combinations of the parties, known as authorized sets, are\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: divince@watson.ibm.com\nElectronic address: patrick@cs.caltech.edu\n\u2021\nElectronic address: terhal@watson.ibm.com\n\u2020\n\n\f2\ncapable of fully reconstructing the secret using quantum communication while the other unauthorized combinations of parties can learn nothing at all about the secret, even if they act jointly\non their shares. A third example, which will be the focus of this paper, is known as quantum data\nhiding. This task, introduced in Refs. [4, 5] for the bipartite setting and generalized to multiple\nparties in Ref. [6], imposes a stronger security criterion than quantum secret sharing. Whereas\nin quantum secret sharing an authorized set may be able to extract information about the secret\nby performing local operations in addition to classical communication, in quantum data hiding\nthe authorized set needs to communicate quantum data in order to get substantive information\nabout the secret. So in quantum data hiding one allows all parties to communicate classical data\nto one another in an effort to reveal the secret. Quantum communication within an unauthorized\nset, supplemented with classical communication between all parties, reveals nothing. (Or, rather,\nnext to nothing; one of the results of Ref. [5] is that perfect quantum data hiding is impossible.)\nThe main result of this paper is the first construction of quantum data hiding protocols for\nhiding qubits; the protocols of Refs. [5] and [6] only work for hiding classical bits. Our method\nis to build on top of the earlier work, converting any method for hiding 2n bits into a method for\nhiding n qubits. For symmetry, we will also demonstrate how any n-qubit data hiding scheme can\nbe converted into a 2n-bit hiding scheme. The connection, which is closely related to the duality\nbetween superdense coding [7] and teleportation [8], is largely independent of the setting of the\nproblem. Indeed, the basic idea, as sketched in Fig. 1, can actually be applied just as well to the\nprivate quantum channel and quantum secret sharing as to quantum data hiding.\nWe begin section II by defining bipartite data hiding and describing the method for converting\nbetween bit and qubit hiding schemes. In sections II A and II B we provide security proofs for the\nresulting schemes under the idealized assumption that the original schemes were perfectly secure\nbefore relaxing to approximate hiding in sections II C and II D. The additional complications that\narise in multipartite hiding are dealt with in section III, where our main result is that the only\nconstraints on the authorized sets are the same as those for quantum secret sharing [9]. Section\nIV demonstrates how the duality imposes limits on the resources required for hiding. As an\napplication, we provide a simple, conceptual proof that 2n bits of shared key are required for an\nn-qubit private quantum channel.\nAs the reader has probably already noticed, the term quantum data hiding refers to the methods\nused rather than the data stored. Rather than resorting to contorted phrases like 'quantum hiding\nof quantum data', we will henceforth omit the first 'quantum' and refer to qubit-hiding schemes or\nbit-hiding schemes. Hopefully, this will simultaneously keep both confusion and redundancy to a\nminimum. In this paper we will denote the density operator corresponding to a pure state |\u03c6i as \u03c6.\nThe phrase 'Trace-preserving Completely Positive map' will be abbreviated to 'TCP map'. A TCP\nmap that can be implemented by Local Operations supplemented by Classical Communication is\ncalled\n\u221a an LOCC map or operation. The trace norm ||A||1 of an operator A is defined as ||A||1 =\nTr A\u2020 A.\nII.\n\nBIPARTITE HIDING\n\nFormalizing the description of data hiding used in the introduction, we define an n-bit data\nhiding scheme for two parties Alice (A) and Bob (B) to consist simply of a set of orthogonal bipartite hiding states {\u03c1AB\nI }, where I = i1 i2 . . . in is an n-bit string. Since these states are orthogonal,\nwe can define a physical encoding map Ec (|IihI|) = \u03c1I . The orthogonality condition guarantees\nthat, if allowed quantum communication, Alice and Bob can perfectly recover I by some decoding\noperations D. The scheme is said to be perfectly secure if Alice and Bob are incapable of learning\nanything using only LOCC operations. Equivalently, the scheme is perfectly secure if, for all I, J\n\n\f3\n\nQuantum Data\n\nA. Quantum from classical hiding\n\nBell\nM\n\nEc\nEncoded Quantum Data\n\nClassical Data\n\nB.

Using the classical hiding scheme Ec\nvia teleportation to get a quantum hiding scheme. B. Using the quantum hiding scheme Eq via superdense\ncoding to get a classical hiding scheme. Double lines denote classical data and solid lines multi-qubit\nquantum data. The gate \u03c3 applies a (tensor product) of Pauli operations as a controlled unitary. Bell M\ndenotes a Bell measurement [8]. Note that in the 'teleportation' circuit in A, the corrective Pauli operations\nare omitted.\n\nand LOCC operations L,\nTrA L(\u03c1I ) = TrA L(\u03c1J ).\n\n(1)\n\nAs noted in the introduction, this perfect security is not actually possible. We say that the scheme\nis \u01eb-secure if, for all I, J and LOCC operations L,\nkTrA L(\u03c1I ) \u2212 TrA L(\u03c1J )k1 < \u01eb.\n\n(2)\n\nIf \u01eb = 0 this definition reduces to perfect security.\nExtending this approach to the case of quantum data, we say that a bipartite n-qubit hiding\nscheme consists of an encoding map Eq taking n-qubit states \u03c6 to bipartite hiding states Eq (\u03c6) on\nAB such that there exists a TCP decoding map D satisfying D(Eq (\u03c6)) = \u03c6 for all \u03c6. The scheme\nis \u03b4-secure if for all \u03c60 and \u03c61 as well as LOCC operations L,\nkTrA L(Eq (\u03c60 )) \u2212 TrA L(Eq (\u03c61 ))k1 < \u03b4.\n\n(3)\n\nHenceforth we will restrict our attention to pure state inputs \u03c60 and \u03c61 . This is sufficient because\nthe convexity of the trace norm ensures that the most distinguishable states will always be pure.\nFor the rest of the paper, we will also impose the additional requirement that the map Eq correspond to a physical operation, meaning that it will be TCP. For the qubit-hiding schemes we\nconstruct, the condition will be satisfied automatically. When we attempt to construct bit hiding\nschemes from qubit-hiding schemes however, our method would fail without the extra condition.\nNow we are ready to explain how to construct secure hiding schemes for sets of n qubits\nstarting from secure hiding schemes for 2n classical bits.\nAssume we have a classical hiding scheme for 2n bits with encoding map Ec . The hiding states\nare \u03c1I , where I = i1 i2 * * * in is a string of length n, each position taking an integer value between 0\n\n\f4\nand 3. Let \u03c6 be an n-qubit state. We define a TCP encoding map Eq by\nEq (\u03c6) =\n\n1 X AB1\n1 X\nB2\nAB1\nE\n(|IihI|)\n\u2297\n\u03c3\n\u03c6\u03c3\n=\n\u03c1I \u2297 \u03c3I \u03c6\u03c3IB2 ,\nc\nI\nI\n22n\n22n\nI\n\n(4)\n\nI\n\nwhere \u03c3I = \u03c3i1 \u2297 \u03c3i2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3in is a tensor product of Pauli operators, adopting the convention\nthat \u03c30 = I. It is clear that if \u03c1I are a set of orthogonal states, there exists a decoding operation\nD such that D \u25e6 Eq (\u03c6) = \u03c6. Notice that Bob's register is divided into two parts, the first storing\nhis half of the bit-hiding states \u03c1I and the second a Pauli-conjugated version of \u03c6. Equivalently, a\nmore operational way of thinking about Eq (\u03c6) is as the output of the circuit illustrated in Fig. 1A.\nUsing a dual construction, any perfectly secure n-qubit hiding scheme can be used to build a\nperfectly secure 2n-bit hiding scheme. Let Eq be some TCP encoding map, not necessarily of the\nform of Eq. (4), hiding states of an n qubit register B1 on a bipartite system AB1 . (We will assume\nwithout loss of generality when discussing this 'superdense coding scheme' that the initial state\nis stored on Bob's system.) Our method of hiding 2n classical bits combines the quantum hiding\nscheme and superdense coding, see Fig. 1B. Let\n|\u03a6I iB1 B2 = (\u03c3I \u2297 IB2 )|\u03a6iB1 B2 ,\n\n(5)\n\nPn\nwhere |\u03a6iB1 B2 = 2\u2212n/2 2k=1 |kiB1 |kiB2 is a maximally entangled state between the registers B1\nand B2 . We define the hiding states for the classical bits to be\n1 B2\n\u03c1I = (Eq \u2297 IB2 )(\u03a6B\n).\nI\n\n(6)\n\nSince Eq is a qubit-hiding scheme there exists a decoding operation D such that D \u25e6 Eq = I. This\nimplies that the classical hiding states \u03c1I are orthogonal since they can be mapped by an operation\nD \u2297 I onto the orthogonal states \u03a6I .\nIn the next few sections we will prove the security of a qubit hiding scheme from the security\nof the bit-hiding scheme and vice-versa.\nA. Perfect Hiding: Classical \u2192 Quantum\n\nOur goal is to show that if the \u03c1I are perfectly secure 2n-bit hiding states then the states Eq (\u03c6),\ndefined in Eq. (4), are, likewise, perfectly secure n-qubit hiding states. By construction, some\nsimple-minded approaches to cheating by Alice and Bob will fail to yield any information about \u03c6.\nFirst, because the reduced state on the B2 register is always maximally mixed, no measurement by\nBob on B2 alone will yield any information about the input state. Similarly, since the AB1 register\nstarts independent of \u03c6, any LOCC protocol applied to it alone will have output independent of\n\u03c6. Moreover, since the \u03c1I form a set of perfect hiding states, Bob's final reduced density operator\non B1 will be independent of I so he can't learn anything that would help him to undo the Idependent Pauli rotations on B2 . This doesn't prove security, however. It is conceivable that by\nacting on B1 and B2 together in an LOCC protocol that Bob might be able cheat by a strategy we\nhaven't yet considered. We now give a formal proof that this is not possible.\nSuppose, on the contrary, that the proposed n-qubit hiding scheme is not secure against arbitrary LOCC cheating. That is, there is a choice of input states \u03c60 and \u03c61 and an LOCC operation\nL such that\nTrA L(Eq (\u03c60 )) 6= TrA L(Eq (\u03c61 )).\n\n(7)\n\nIn words, Bob's output density operator at the end of the LOCC protocol depends on the input\nstate, meaning that he can perform a local measurement that will distinguish to some degree\n\n\f5\nbetween inputs \u03c60 and \u03c61 . Our goal in what follows will be to prove that if this were true, the \u03c1I\ncould not be perfect hiding states.\nFor convenience, we'll adopt the more compact notation L = TrA \u25e6 L. We can then introduce\nthe operations\n1\nLI (\u03c4 B2 ) = L(\u03c1AB\n\u2297 \u03c4 B2 )\nI\n\n(8)\n\nwhich represent the action of the LOCC operation L given a particular value of the hiding state\n\u03c1I . Note that LI , while it is TCP, is not necessarily itself an LOCC operation because it involves the\n1\npreparation of a potentially entangled ancilla \u03c1AB\n. We can then write\nI\n1 X\nLI (\u03c3I \u03c6\u03c3I )\n(9)\nL(Eq (\u03c6)) = 2n\n2\nI\n\nfor the output of the 'cheating' operation on an n-qubit hiding state. From this identity, we can\nconclude that not all the LI are identical to L0 , however; if they were, then by linearity,\n!\n1 X\n\u03c3I \u03c6\u03c3I\nL(Eq (\u03c6)) = L0\n22n\nI\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n= L0\nIB\n(10)\n2n 2\n\nwould be independent of the input state \u03c6, violating Eq. (7).\nThe non-constancy of the LI can then be converted into a method for breaking the 2n-bit hiding\n1\nscheme. Supplied with a state \u03c1AB\nfrom which they would like to learn about I, Alice and Bob\nI\nimplement the following LOCC protocol. First, Bob prepares a maximally entangled state\nn\n\nB2 B3\n\n|\u03a6i\n\n2\n1 X B2 B3\n\u221a\n|ki |ki\n=\n2n k=1\n\n(11)\n\nbetween two local registers B2 and B3 . Alice and Bob then together apply the LOCC operation\n1\nL \u2297 IB3 to the state \u03c1AB\n\u2297 \u03a6B2 B3 , resulting in the outcome (LI \u2297 IB3 )(\u03a6) on Bob's system alone.\nI\nBy the Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism between operations and states [10], the non-constancy of the\nLI implies that the outcome cannot be independent of I. Hence, Bob can perform a local measurement whose outcome will be I-dependent and the 2n bit hiding scheme based on the \u03c1I cannot\nbe secure.\nB.\n\nPerfect Hiding: Quantum \u2192 Classical\n\nConsider the definition of the bit-hiding states in Eq. (6). Because we can choose an operator\nbasis consisting of density operators \u03c4J , there is an expansion\nX\n|\u03a6ih\u03a6|B1 B2 =\n\u03b1JK \u03c4J \u2297 \u03c4K\n(12)\nJK\n\nof the projector for the maximally entangled state in terms of density operators for product states.\n(The \u03b1JK , of course, will not all be positive.)\nNow let's try cheating on our 2n-bit hiding scheme. If L = TrA \u25e6 L is again an LOCC operation\nwith output on Bob's system, then substituting Eq. (12) into (6) shows that\n1 B2\nL(\u03c1I ) = L((Eq \u2297 IB2 )(\u03a6B\n))\nI\nX\nB2\n=\n\u03b1JK L(Eq (\u03c3I \u03c4J \u03c3I )AB1 \u2297 \u03c4K\n).\n\nJK\n\n(13)\n\n\f6\nThe operation of first preparing \u03c4K on B2 and then applying L is itself LOCC so by the perfect\nB2\nsecurity of the n-qubit hiding scheme, we can conclude that L(Eq (\u03c3I \u03c4J \u03c3I )AB1 \u2297 \u03c4K\n) is independent of \u03c3I \u03c4J \u03c3I for all I and J. Consequently, L(\u03c1I ) is independent of I, meaning that the 2n-bit\nhiding scheme is perfectly secure.\nC.\n\nImperfect Hiding: Classical \u2192 Quantum\n\nAs was shown in Ref. [5], while a bit-hiding scheme can be made \u01eb-secure for all \u01eb > 0, perfect\nsecurity is not possible. So, we need to investigate whether a nearly secure bit-hiding scheme\nleads to a nearly secure qubit-hiding scheme. We show that an \u01eb-secure 2n-bit hiding scheme can\nbe converted into a \u03b4-secure n-qubit hiding scheme, for \u03b4 = \u01eb2n+1 . The exponential factor 2n+1 ,\nwhile undesirable, needn't cause practical difficulties: for the bit-hiding schemes presented in\nRefs. [5] and [6], \u01eb decreases exponentially with the size of the hiding state. Therefore, the factor\n2n+1 can be suppressed at a cost of increasing the size of the hiding state by a factor polynomial\nin n. Furthermore, it could very well be that the estimates we present here are not tight and that\nthe factor is only an artifact of our analysis. In any case, the idea behind the proof of security is\nthe same as in the perfect case but the details, unfortunately, become significantly more technical.\nSo as not to repeat ourselves, we will adopt the notation of section II A.\nIn the perfect case, we proceeded by making a connection between the behavior of L \u25e6 Eq and\n(LI \u2297 IB3 )(\u03a6B2 B3 ). Name this last operator \u03c9I and introduce \u2206I = \u03c9I \u2212 \u03c90 . Recall also that the\nencoding operation Eq takes B2 , an n-qubit system, to AB1 B2 while the LOCC L takes AB1 B2 to\na Bob-only system. Since we don't want to make any assumptions yet about it's structure, we will\ncall this system Bf . We define the state\n\u03be Bf B3 = ((L \u25e6 Eq ) \u2297 IB3 ) (\u03a6B2 B3 ).\n\n(14)\n\nThe state \u03be can be related to the action of the map L \u25e6 Eq on a state \u03c6 by the identity\n\u03c6 = 2n Tr2 ((I \u2297 \u03c6\u2217)\u03a612 ),\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2217 is the complex conjugate of the density matrix of \u03c6 and the numbers 1 and 2 are general\nsystem labels. Now, as in the perfect hiding case, assume that the n-qubit hiding scheme is not\n\u03b4-secure, meaning that there exist states \u03c60 and \u03c61 such that\n\u03b4 < k(L \u25e6 Eq )(\u03c60 ) \u2212 (L \u25e6 Eq )(\u03c61 )k1 .\n\n(16)\n\nUsing the identity in Eq. (15) and the definition of \u03be, we find that\n\u03b4 < 2n kTrB3 (I \u2297 \u03c6\u22170 )\u03be Bf B3 \u2212 TrB3 (I \u2297 \u03c6\u22171 )\u03be Bf B3 k1 .\n\n(17)\n\nIn order to relate \u03b4 to \u2206I , we rewrite \u03be in the following manner:\n\u03be Bf B3 = ((L \u25e6 Eq ) \u2297 IB3 ) \u03a6B2 B3\n\u0001\n1 X\n(LI \u2297 IB3 ) (\u03c3I \u2297 IB3 )\u03a6B2 B3 (\u03c3I \u2297 IB3 )\n= 2n\n2\nI\n1 X\n(IBf \u2297 \u03c3I )\u03c9I (IBf \u2297 \u03c3I )\n= 2n\n2\nI\n1 X\n1\n(IBf \u2297 \u03c3I )\u2206I (IBf \u2297 \u03c3I ),\n= TrB3 \u03c90 \u2297 n IB3 + 2n\n2\n2\nI\n\n(18)\n\n\f7\nwhere we have used the fact that (I \u2297 \u03c3I )|\u03a6i = \u00b1(\u03c3I \u2297 I)|\u03a6i. When inserting this in Eq. (17) we\nobserve that the term involving TrB3 \u03c90 \u2297 21n IB3 makes no contribution so we need only keep the\nsum over (I \u2297 \u03c3I )\u2206I (I \u2297 \u03c3I ). In the following derivation we will need the inequality\n||P A||1 \u2264 ||A||1 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere P is a projector. This can be proved as follows. Let \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . . . be the singular values of\nA. Let P be a k-dimensional projector. We have\n||P A||1 = max Tr(P AU ) \u2264 max Tr(QAU ) =\nU\n\nU,Q\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi \u2264 ||A||1 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we used that Q is k-dimensional projector.\nWe insert the result of Eq. (18) in Eq. (17) and apply Eq. (19), the monotonicity under partial\ntrace and subadditivity of the trace norm to find\n1 X\nk(I \u2297 \u03c6\u22170 )(I \u2297 \u03c3I )\u2206I (I \u2297 \u03c3I )k1\n\u03b4 < n\n2\nI\n1 X\n+ n\nk(I \u2297 \u03c6\u22171 )(I \u2297 \u03c3I )\u2206I (I \u2297 \u03c3I )k1\n2\nI\n1 X\nk(I \u2297 \u03c3I )\u2206I (I \u2297 \u03c3I )k1\n\u2264 n\u22121\n2\nI\n1 X\nk\u2206I k1 .\n(21)\n= n\u22121\n2\nI\n\nReading this inequality as an average over the 22n possible values of I, there must exist a particular choice for I for which k\u03c9I \u2212 \u03c9I=0 k1 = k\u2206I k1 > \u03b4/2n+1 . As in the perfect hiding argument,\nthis provides a cheating operation for the classical scheme that will distinguish the hiding states\nof the particular I and I = 0. The classical scheme, therefore, cannot be \u03b4/2n+1 -secure.\nD.\n\nImperfect Hiding: Quantum \u2192 Classical\n\nWe suppose that there is some quantum hiding scheme Eq that is \u03b4-secure, i.e. for all pairs of\nquantum states \u03c60 and \u03c61 and LOCC operations L we have\nk(L \u25e6 Eq )(\u03c60 ) \u2212 (L \u25e6 Eq )(\u03c61 )k1 \u2264 \u03b4.\n\n(22)\n\n\u00bfFrom this we will deduce the quality of the derived bit-hiding scheme, that is, we study\nkL(\u03c1I ) \u2212 L(\u03c1J )k1 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03c1I and \u03c1J are given in Eq. (6). We will use an explicit operator expansion of the maximally\nentangled projector Eq. (12) [5, Eq. (24)]:\nn\n\n4 \u22121\n1 X\n(\u22121)N (11) \u03c3M \u2297 \u03c3M .\n\u03a6= n\n4\n\n(24)\n\nM =0\n\nHere N (11) counts the number of \u03c3y operators in the product \u03c3M . Note also that \u03c3M , for any M ,\nhas 2n\u22121 positive eigenvalues (\u03bb = +1), and the same number of negative eigenvalues ( \u03bb = \u22121);\ntherefore, it can be written as the difference of two density operators using\nM\n\u03c3M = 2n\u22121 (\u03c1M\n+ \u2212 \u03c1\u2212 ),\n\n(25)\n\n\f8\nIM I =\nwhere \u03c1M\n\u00b1 are separable.

(22).\nEq (\u03c1+\n) from Eq (\u03c1KM\n\u2212\nSo, we get a bound on the quality of the bit-hiding scheme, although one suffering the same\nexponential deficiency as the bound of section II C.\nIII.\n\nMULTIPARTY HIDING & QUANTUM SECRET SHARING\n\nWe now consider the task of hiding quantum data in a multiparty setting. Generalizations\nof bipartite bit-hiding schemes to multipartite situations have been developed by Eggeling and\nWerner [6]. Unfortunately, there is a problem with combining these bit-hiding schemes with the\nqubit-hiding construction of Eq. (4): the qubit-hiding scheme places the hidden quantum state\nentirely in the possession of a single party since register B2 belongs to Bob. In the direct generalization of the scheme to the multiparty setting, the privileged holder of the hidden quantum state\nwould, therefore, necessarily have to be a member of every authorized set. This would eliminate\nthe possibility of threshold schemes, for example, in which any sufficiently large subset of the\nparties should be able reconstruct the secret. The solution is to hide distributed quantum data,\nusing quantum error correcting codes to share the hidden quantum state between the parties in a\nmore symmetrical fashion.\nAn application involving such distributed hiding has been considered in the literature: quantum secret sharing [3]. In quantum secret sharing, the identity of a distributed quantum state,\n\n\f9\nheld by a set of parties, is unobtainable by these parties if they do only local operations. There\nare authorized sets of parties who, with quantum communication among each other, can reconstruct (i.e., put the full state in the possession of any single party) the quantum state, and there are\nunauthorized sets, for whom no reconstruction is possible even with quantum communication.\nSuch quantum secret sharing schemes are implementable with quantum error correcting codes;\nfor example, there is a five-qubit error correcting code for which any three out of the five parties\nconstitute an authorized set, while any set of two is unauthorized. With such error correction\ncodes, quantum secret sharing schemes with any \"access structure\" are realizable. This access\nstructure need only be consistent with monotonicity and the quantum no-cloning theorem, meaning that any superset of an authorized set is authorized, and the complement of an authorized set\nis unauthorized [9].\nThe capabilities of quantum secret sharing can be strengthened by the techniques of this paper. The quantum secret sharing protocol does not specify the status of the secret if the parties\ncan perform LOCC operations, rather than just local operations. In fact, for the implementation\nof quantum secret sharing using quantum error correcting codes, LOCC operations between the\nparties can, and often do, result in the parties obtaining partial information about the secret. However, by wrapping the quantum state of quantum secret sharing inside a multipartite version of\nour qubit-hiding protocol, we can guarantee that the quantum secret is impervious to attack by\nLOCC operations of the parties; we illustrate the idea in Fig. 2. This requires some generalization\nof the protocol given above, and of its security analysis.\n\nFIG. 2: If five parties each have shares of a state in a five-qubit error correcting code, then the identity of\nthe state cannot be obtained by two parties in quantum communication [9]. But if all parties are in addition\nin classical communication with one another (dotted lines), then the parties can obtain some information\nabout the state. If, however, the secret-sharing state is encoded using a bit-hiding state holding 2 \u00d7 5 bits\n(Eq. (27)), then the parties can obtain only a negligible amount of information about the hidden quantum\nstate.\n\nSuppose we have a p-party quantum secret sharing state \u03c6, and that k qubits distributed\namong these parties are sufficient to hold this state. (For quantum secret sharing schemes, k\nis polynomially related to the number of logical qubits n that can be hidden in such a state,\nk = poly(n, p).) Now, we can create a new state with stronger security properties using the map\nE(\u03c6) =\n\n1 X 1\n\u03c1I \u2297 (\u03c3I \u03c6\u03c3I )2\n22k\nI\n\n(27)\n\n\f10\nHere the quantum secret lives in subsystem \"2\", which is an k-qubit multipartite Hilbert space\ndistributed among the p parties HA2 \u2297 HB2 \u2297 HC2 \u2297 .... The dimensions of these local spaces need\nnot be the same, since some parties may get larger shares of the secret than others. Each party also\nhas a register of subsystem \"1\", comprising s qubits in total, which contains the data hiding state\n\u03c1I , and which is capable of hiding the 2k-bit string I. Note that, although the secret-sharing state\n\u03c6 may only occupy a subspace of the \"2\" subsystem (as when it is a quantum error correcting\ncode state), \u03c3I acts on the entire \"2\" Hilbert space, not just on the code subspace in which the\nquantum secret may be contained.\nAs Eggeling and Werner have recently shown, there exist multipartite data-hiding states \u03c1I\nwith any desired access structure, and with hiding security that is exponential in s/k [6]. (Unlike\nthe bipartite states used in Ref. [5], however, these states are not orthogonal, just nearly so. This\ngives rise to a small probability of error when authorized sets reconstruct the secret but otherwise\nhas no effect on the analysis for our purposes.) If we choose the access structure of the \u03c1I states\nand the \u03c6 quantum secret sharing states to be identical, then the quantum state can obviously still\nbe reconstructed by quantum communication within an authorized set; first \u03c1I is measured to\nidentify I, then the Pauli rotation \u03c3I is done by the authorized parties, so that they have the state\n\u03c6 \"in the clear\", permitting them to reconstruct it by whatever operations the original quantum\nsecret sharing protocol prescribed. Of course, it does not matter whether the Pauli rotations are\ndone by the parties outside the authorized set, since these parts of the quantum state \u03c6 are not\nneeded for the reconstruction anyway.\nIn the rest of this section, we demonstrate the other part of the desired security of the protocol:\nan unauthorized set cannot reveal the quantum state even when all parties can perform LOCC\nand quantum communication can be performed within the unauthorized set. The proof relies on\nthe fact, as in the bipartite case, that with these resources, the parties cannot decode the classical\nhiding states \u03c1I .\nSo, we suppose that in the given \"unauthorized\" setting, the 2k-bit hiding scheme is \u01eb-secure;\nwe will show that the quantum-state hiding is guaranteed to be \u03b4-secure, for \u03b4 = \u01eb23k+5 . The first\npart of the demonstration closely follows the reasoning of Section II C. We consider \"cheating\"\noperations L+ = Tr\u2032 \u25e6 L+ , where L+ is a member of the set of LOCC operations + quantum\noperations among members of the unauthorized set, and Tr\u2032 indicates a tracing out of all parties\n2\n+ 1\n2\nexcept one. We will also need the multipartite version of Eq. (8), L+\nI (\u03c4 ) = L (\u03c1I \u2297 \u03c4 ). Given\n+\n1\nthat the parties are supplied with the state \u03c1I , LI can be implemented with the same limited\ncommunication resources as L+ can. We introduce ancilla subsystem \"3\", which has the same\ndimension and the same multipartite structure as subsystem \"2\". Each party locally creates a\nmaximally entangled state \u03a6 between its part of system 2 and 3. Let us denote the tensor product\nof all these local maximally entangled states as a big maximally entangled state \u03a623 . Then the\nparties can create the state\n23\n\u03c9I = (L+\nI \u2297 I3 )(\u03a6 ).\n\n(28)\n\nNow the proof begins by contradiction as in Section II C: suppose the qubit-hiding scheme\nis not \u03b4-secure, meaning that there are secret sharing states \u03c60 and \u03c61 and a cheating operation\nL+ such that Eq. (16) is true. Then by following without change the analysis after Eq. (16), we\nconclude that there must exist a bit string I for which (cf. below Eq. (21))\nk\u03c9I=0 \u2212 \u03c9I k1 = k\u2206I k1 > \u03b4/2k+1 .\n\n(29)\n\nUnlike in the previous case, we cannot use this equation immediately to bound \u01eb and end the\nargument; the trace norm is only directly related to the distinguishability when any quantum\noperation can be done on the state. In this case \u03c9I is a state shared by all parties who can perform\n\n\f11\nLOCC operations and some additional quantum communication depending on the protocol. In\nother words, we can only bound the distinguishability \u01eb of the classical message by (see Eq. (2))\n\u01eb \u2265 max DistL+ (\u03c9I , \u03c9K ) \u2265 max DistLLOCC (\u03c9I , \u03c9K ) = max max kLLOCC (\u03c9I ) \u2212 LLOCC (\u03c9K )k1 .\nI, K\n\nI, K\n\nI, K LLOCC\n\n(30)\nHere DistX denotes the distinguishability of two states under the set of operations X. We restrict\nto only LOCC operations here because we can use a known relationship between the LOCC distinguishability of two states and their trace-norm distance, using the tomography arguments of\nRef. [5]. Of course, this LOCC distinguishability may be very much less than k\u03c9I=0 \u2212 \u03c9I k1 , precisely because of the data-hiding effect that is the subject of this paper, which sometimes prevents\nthe distinguishability of states from being detectable by LOCC operations. The effect is never\nperfect, however, a fact which we now use.\nSuppose the states \u03c9I are written as [5, Eq. (105)]\n\u03c9I =\n\n1X\naIJ \u03c3J ,\nd\n\n(31)\n\nJ\n\nwhere d is the dimension of the space supporting \u03c9I . The \"3\" register in Eq. (28) supports k\nqubits whereas the map LI can be taken to output a single qubit [13]. Therefore, d = 2k+1 . Then\nAppendix B of Ref. [5, Eq. (110)] shows that\nDistLOCC (\u03c9I , \u03c9K ) \u2265\n\n1\nmax |aIJ \u2212 aKJ |.\n2 J\n\n(32)\n\nWe apply a chain of inequalities:\nk\u03c9I \u2212 \u03c9K k1 \u2264\n=\n\nX\nJ\n\n1X\n1X\nk(aIJ \u2212 aKJ )\u03c3J k1 \u2264\nkaIJ \u2212 aKJ k1 k\u03c3J k1\nd\nd\nJ\n\nJ\n\n2\n\n|aIJ \u2212 aKJ | \u2264 d max |aIJ \u2212 aKJ |.\nJ\n\n(33)\n\nWe have used ||\u03c3J ||1 = d. Note also that there are d2 terms in the J-sum. Combining (30), (32)\nand (33):\n\u01eb\u2265\n\n1\n||\u03c9I=0 \u2212 \u03c9I ||1 .\n2d2\n\n(34)\n\nSo, combining this with Eq. (29), we find that\n\u01eb\u2265\n\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n= 3k+5 .\n3\n4d\n2\n\n(35)\n\nBut since the classical hiding can be chosen such that \u01eb = c1 2\u2212c2 s/k , there is always a choice of\ns that will guarantee that \u03b4 is as small as desired. So, at the price of a worse bound (but only\npolynomially worse), we prove security of the multipartite case.\nIV.\n\nHOW MANY CLASSICAL BITS ARE NEEDED IN QUANTUM HIDING\n\nIn the previous sections we have seen that any 2n-bit hiding scheme can be used to construct an\nn-qubit hiding scheme and vice-versa. This duality has immediate implications for the resource\n\n\f12\nrequirements of quantum data hiding schemes. In particular, suppose that {\u03c1I } is a set of perfectly\nsecure hiding states for the string I, representing k bits of data and that\n1 X AB1\n\u03c1I \u2297 TI (\u03c6)B2 ,\n(36)\nEq (\u03c6) = k\n2\nI\n\nwhere TI is a TCP map and \u03c6 is an n-qubit state. We do not know whether all n-qubit hiding\nschemes will have this form but it is a significant generalization of the construction we described\nin section II. We will show that in order for this to be a secure qubit hiding scheme k \u2265 2n.\nLet us assume that this provides a perfectly secure n-qubit hiding scheme for \u03c6, and use the\nencoding Eq to hide bits by means of our superdense coding construction. We will get a secure\n2n-bit hiding scheme by applying Eq \u2297 I to the appropriate maximally entangled states. We could\ninterpret this construction as a way of hiding a message of 2n bits by means of a key I of k\nbits. We will now prove that this implies that k \u2265 2n, using an argument nearly identical to the\none Shannon used to show that one-time pad encryption of a 2n-bit message requires 2n shared\nrandom key bits [11]. The only difference here is that we substitute quantum entropy functions\nfor their classical counterparts and then have to verify in a couple of places that these quantum\nfunctions are nonnegative, a property guaranteed for their classical versions. For definitions of\nthe functions we use below, see, for example, Ref. [12].\nConsider the density operator\nX\n1\npm |mihm|M \u2297 |IihI|K \u2297 \u03c1AB\n\u2297 (TI \u2297 I)(|\u03a6m ih\u03a6m |)B2 B3 .\n(37)\nI\nm,I\n\nHere M is a register storing the message m, K a register storing the key I and the set {\u03a6m }\nis a set of mutually orthogonal maximally entangled states. Because the message and key are\nindependent, S(M : K) = 0. Likewise, because the bit-hiding scheme is perfectly secure, S(M :\nB2 B3 ) = 0. Once the key is known, however, the classical message can be reconstructed from\nregister B2 B3 so that\nS(M : B2 B3 |K) = S(M : K|B2 B3 ) = S(M ).\n\n(38)\n\nEquivalently, S(K|B2 B3 ) \u2212 S(K|B2 B3 M ) = S(M ). Because the multipartite density operator is\nseparable across the M/K/AB1 /B2 B3 cuts, S(K|B2 B3 M ) \u2265 0, and we can conclude that S(K) \u2265\nS(M ). In particular, applying this inequality for the uniform distribution over 2n bit messages\nyields k \u2265 2n. Our conclusion is that if an n-qubit hiding scheme is constructed from a k-bit\nhiding scheme in the manner of Eq. (36) then k, the number of bits, must be at least twice the\nnumber of qubits being hidden.\nThese arguments can also be applied to the case of a private quantum channel. In this scenario,\nthe analog of an k-bit hiding scheme is just k secret random bits shared between two parties Alice\nand Bob. A general private quantum channel then has the form\n1 X\n|I, IihI, I|AB \u2297 TI (\u03c6)C ,\n(39)\nE(\u03c6) = k\n2\nI\n\nwhere TI is a general TCP map with output on the channel system C. The requirements for\nthe task are that, using their access to I, Bob (or Alice) can reconstruct \u03c6 but an eavesdropper\nwith access only to the channel C can learn nothing. Assume that one can encrypt an n-qubit\nquantum state \u03c6 in this manner. Such a private quantum channel can be converted into a secure\n2n-bit one-time pad using the superdense coding construction of section II B \u2013 the proof goes\nthrough unchanged. Likewise, the resource considerations developed above imply that k \u2265 2n\nbits of shared secret key are necessary and sufficient to build the n-qubit private quantum channel,\nconfirming the main result of Refs. [1] and [2].\n\n\f13\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOur main goal in this paper was to show how the duality between superdense coding and\nteleportation can be used to construct new cryptographic protocols. From a constructive point\nof view, our main results are a protocol for hiding qubits given a protocol for hiding twice as\nmany bits and a method for strengthening quantum secret sharing protocols such that they are\nnot vulnerable to cheating by LOCC.\nIn our analyses of imperfect hiding, however, we could only guarantee a quality of hiding\ndecreasing exponentially in the number of qubits, or bits, being hidden. Because the quality\ntypically improves exponentially with the size of the hiding state measured in qubits, our security\nproofs could still be useful. Nonetheless, it seems possible that a more careful analysis of the\nhiding quality of the new protocols would reveal that the exponential factor, in fact, disappears.\nWe leave that possibility open for future work.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dave Bacon, Debbie Leung and Andreas Winter for discussions of this work.
