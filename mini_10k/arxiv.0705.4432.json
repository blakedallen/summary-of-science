We prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1 (Shimura curves in the Schottky locus). Given an integer\ns \u2265 0, there is a natural number B = B(s), depending only on s, such that a\nrational Shimura curve, whose Higgs field is strictly maximal and whose bad\nlocus S contains at most s points, cannot lie in the closure of the Schottky\nlocus Mg for g > B.\nThe Schottky locus is the image of the moduli space Mg of curves of genus\ng in Ag - the moduli space of principally polarized g-dimensional Abelian\nvarieties (with a suitable level structure). We say that a Shimura curve in Ag\nlies in the closure of the Schottky locus if it generically intersects the image\nof Mg in Ag . So, in particular, it should not lie entirely in the boundary of\nthe closure of Mg in Ag .\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\nBy Shimura variety we mean a Shimura variety of Hodge type which is an\n\u00e9tale covering of a certain moduli space of Abelian varieties with prescribed\nMumford-Tate group and a suitable level structure as defined in [Mu66]. A\nShimura curve is a one-dimensional Shimura variety.\nLet f : A\u2192Y be a semistable family of Abelian varieties over a complex\nprojective curve Y , U = Y \u2212 S the smooth locus and V = f \u22121 (U ) so\nthat f : V \u2192U is an Abelian scheme. Consider the Higgs bundle (E, \u03b8)\ngiven by taking the graded sheaf of the Deligne extension of R1 f\u2217 CV \u2297 OU\nwhere R1 f\u2217 CV is the weight 1 variation of Hodge structures. We have a\ndecomposition E = F \u2295N into an ample part F and a flat part N . Following\n[VZ03] we say that the Higgs field is maximal if\n\u03b8 1,0 : F 1,0 \u2212\u2192 F 0,1 \u2297 \u03a91Y (log S)\nis an isomorphism, and that the Higgs field is strictly maximal if additionally\nN = 0.\nViehweg and Zuo showed in [VZ04] that if each irreducible and nonunitary sub-variation V of Hodge structures in R1 f\u2217 CV has a strictly maximal Higgs field, then there is an \u00e9tale covering U \u2032 \u2192U such that U \u2032 is a\nShimura curve and f \u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192U \u2032 is the corresponding universal family. Moreover, M\u00f6ller showed in [M\u00f605] that the converse also holds. Hence we have\na characterization of Shimura curves by the maximality of the Higgs field of\nthe corresponding universal family.\nCombining the results of Viehweg and Zuo [VZ06] which say that a\nShimura curve U in Mg has to be non-compact with the techniques of\nM\u00f6ller shows that U has also to be a Teichm\u00fcller curve. Then from [M\u00f605]\nit follows that there are no such curves in Mg unless g = 3. See also the\ndiscussion in [MVZ05].\nObserve that this result deals with the occurrence of Shimura curves in\nMg rather than its closure in Ag . So it does not answer the question if there\nare Shimura curves in the closure of the Schottky locus.\nWe remark that the conjecture of Andr\u00e9-Oort, saying that a Shimura variety is characterized by having a dense set of CM-points, and the conjecture\nof Coleman, saying that there are only finitely many CM-points in Mg for\nhigh genus g, suggest that there are no Shimura varieties in the closure of\nthe Schottky locus for g sufficiently large.\nIn [Ha99], Hain studied families of compact Jacobians over locally symmetric domains U satisfying an additional technical condition. Based on his\nmethods, de Jong and Zhang [dJZ06] were able to exclude certain types of\nhigher-dimensional Shimura varieties.\nReturning to Shimura curves, we will prove Theorem (1.1) as follows. Let\nC\u2192Y be a family of complex curves whose family of Jacobians J\u2192Y has\na strictly maximal Higgs field. If Y = P1C , then a further result of Viehweg\nand Zuo from [VZ04] says that J\u2192Y is Y -isogenous to the g-fold product\nE \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E of a modular family of elliptic curves E\u2192Y . So Theorem\n\n\fON SHIMURA CURVES IN THE SCHOTTKY LOCUS\n\n3\n\n(1.1) will follow from the following theorem, which holds for an arbitrary\nbase curve Y .\nTheorem 1.2 (Bound for the genus). Let C\u2192Y be a family of curves of\ngenus g whose Jacobian J\u2192Y is Y -isogenous to the g-fold product of a nonisotrivial family of elliptic curves E\u2192Y which can be defined over a number\nfield. Then the genus g is bounded, i. e. there is a number B = B(E/Y ),\ndepending only on E\u2192Y , such that g is smaller than d.\nMind that modular families of elliptic curves can be defined over number\nfields. We will prove Theorem (1.2) by reducing the situation from C to a\nnumber field F . Then we reduce to a finite field by selecting a suitable finite\nprime of F . Finally, we prove that the genus g of the fibers of a family of\ncurves C\u2192Y , defined over a finite field and whose family of Jacobians is\nisogenous to the g-fold product of a family of elliptic curves, is bounded.\nWe achieve this by counting the number of singularities \u03b4 in the fibers\nof C\u2192Y . Combining the Weil conjectures for the fibers with the Sato-Tate\nconjecture about the distribution of Frobenius traces in a family of elliptic\ncurves, we will get a lower bound for \u03b4. On the other hand, the geometry of\nthe total space C of C\u2192Y will give an upper bound. For large g, the lower\nbound will exceed the upper bound. Thus, the genus has to be bounded.\nI would like to thank my adviser Eckart Viehweg for his continuous support and encouragement while writing this paper. I would also like to thank\nGebhard B\u00f6ckle, Martin M\u00f6ller and Pooji Singla for pointing out several\nmistakes. This work was financially supported by the DFG.\n2. Shimura curves and maximal Higgs fields\nLet Y be an irreducible smooth projective curve over the field of complex\nnumbers C and let f : A\u2192Y be a semistable family of g-dimensional Abelian\nvarieties, i. e. f : A\u2192Y is a flat, projective C-morphism whose generic fiber\nis an Abelian variety of dimension g. Let U \u2282 Y be the smooth locus of\nA\u2192Y , i. e. the restriction of A\u2192Y to U is an Abelian scheme A0 \u2192U while\nthe fibers over the set S = Y \u2212 U are all singular. Consider the weight\n1 variation of Hodge structures R1 f\u2217 ZA0 and let F be the non-flat part of\nthe Higgs bundle (E, \u03b8) given by taking the graded sheaf of the Deligne\nextension of R1 f\u2217 ZA0 \u2297 OU to Y which carries a Hodge filtration. Then the\nArakelov inequality for families of Abelian varieties [JZ02] says that\n\u0001\n0 < 2 * deg(F 1,0 ) \u2264 g0 * 2q \u2212 2 + #S\n\nwhere q denotes the genus of the base curve Y and g0 is the rank of F 1,0 . We\nsay that the family of Abelian varieties A\u2192Y reaches the Arakelov bound\nif the above inequality becomes an equality. Viehweg and Zuo showed in\n[VZ04] that this property is equivalent to the maximality of the Higgs field\nfor F , i. e. the map \u03b8|F 1,0 : F 1,0 \u2192F 0,1 \u2297 \u03a91Y (log S) is an isomorphism.\n\n\f4\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\nMoreover, the Higgs field is called strictly maximal if in addition the Higgs\nbundle has no flat part.\nAssume that V \u2192U is a Shimura curve, i. e. U is an \u00e9tale covering of\na certain moduli space of Abelian varieties with prescribed Mumford-Tate\ngroup and a suitable level structure, and V \u2192U is the corresponding universal family, see [M\u00f605]. Then M\u00f6ller showed that U \u2192V has a maximal Higgs\nfield.\nTheorem 2.1 (Shimura implies maximal Higgs). If V \u2192U is the universal\nfamily over a Shimura curve, then its Higgs field is maximal.\nProof. See [MVZ05, Thm.0.9] or [M\u00f605, Thm.1.2].\n\n\u0003\n\nThe converse was shown by Viehweg and Zuo in [VZ04], see also [MVZ05].\nSo we have a Characterization of Shimura curves by its corresponding Higgs\nfield. Moreover, Viehweg and Zuo showed that after an \u00e9tale extension the\nfamily A\u2192Y decomposes in the following way.\nTheorem 2.2 (Decomposition Theorem). If V \u2192U has a maximal Higgs\nfield and S 6= \u2205, the there is an \u00e9tale covering Y \u2032 \u2192Y such that the pull-back\nfamily A\u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is Y \u2032 -isogenous to a product\nE \u00d7Y \u2032 * * * \u00d7Y \u2032 E \u00d7C B\nwhere B/C is an Abelian variety of dimension g\u2212g0 and E\u2192Y \u2032 is a modular\nfamily of elliptic curves.\nProof. See [VZ04, Thm.0.2] or [MVZ05, Cor.0.10].\n\n\u0003\n\nModular means that the smooth locus U \u2032 of E\u2192Y \u2032 is the quotient \u0393\\H of\nthe upper half-plane H by a subgroup \u0393 \u2282 SL2 (Z) of finite index and E\u2192Y \u2032\nis over U \u2032 the quotient of H \u00d7 C by the semi-direct product of \u0393 and Z2 .\nIf the Higgs field is strictly maximal so that g0 = g, then there is no\nconstant part. Hence, A\u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is Y \u2032 -isogenous to a product E \u00d7Y \u2032 . . . \u00d7Y \u2032 E\nwith E\u2192Y \u2032 modular.\nNow let C\u2192Y be a semistable family of curves of genus g with J\u2192Y its\ncorresponding family of Jacobians. Let V \u2192U be the the smooth part of\nJ\u2192Y and S = Y \u2212 U the bad locus - as before with A\u2192Y instead of J\u2192Y .\nAssume that V \u2192U is a Shimura curve so that its Higgs field is maximal.\nIf Y = P1C , then the Arakelov inequality above tells us that S 6= \u2205. If we\nfurther assume that the Higgs field of V \u2192U is not only maximal but strictly\nmaximal, then the Jacobian has the following decomposition.\nCorollary 2.3 (Structure of the Jacobian). Let C\u2192Y be a semistable family\nof curves of genus g whose Jacobian J\u2192Y has a strictly maximal Higgs field.\nIf Y = P1C , then J\u2192Y is Y -isogenous to the g-fold product E \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E\nof a modular family of elliptic curves E\u2192Y .\n\n\fON SHIMURA CURVES IN THE SCHOTTKY LOCUS\n\n5\n\nProof. Because of the Arakelov inequality we have S 6= \u2205. So we may apply\nTheorem (2.2). Since Y = P1C has no other \u00e9tale coverings than automorphisms, the splitting takes place over Y .\n\u0003\nWe will show that for a fixed modular family E\u2192Y there cannot exist\nfamilies of curves C\u2192Y of arbitrary large genus whose Jacobian is a g-fold\nproduct of E\u2192Y .\n3. Reduction to number fields\nWe want to show that a family of curves C\u2192Y whose Jacobian J\u2192Y\nis Y -isogenous to the g-fold product of a modular family of elliptic curves\nE\u2192Y is (after a base change) defined over a number field F which depends\nonly on E\u2192Y and not on g.\nWe say that a family of curves or group schemes X\u2192Y is defined over\na number field F if there is a curve Y0 /F and a family of curves or group\nschemes X0 \u2192Y0 over F such that Y0 \u00d7F C \u2243 Y over C and the pull-back\nfamily X0 \u00d7F C\u2192Y0 \u00d7F C \u2243 Y is Y -birational to X\u2192Y , i. e. the families\nhave isomorphic generic fibers.\nWe say that a Y -morphism f between two families X\u2192Y and Z\u2192Y is\ndefined over a number field F if X\u2192Y and Z\u2192Y are defined over F and\nthere is a Y0 -morphism f0 : X0 \u2192Y0 which coincides generically with the\nY -morphism f : X\u2192Y after the base change Spec C\u2192Spec F .\nAs we will see, the reason why C\u2192Y descends to a number field is that\nmodular families of elliptic curves E\u2192Y are defined over number fields. We\nstart by describing the torsion structure of families of elliptic curves E\u2192Y\nvia Galois representations.\nLet K := C(Y ) be the function field of Y and Kv be the v-adic completion\nof K where v denotes a normalized discrete\nvaluation of K induced by some\n\u0001\npoint y \u2208 Y (C). Let Gv = Gal Kv /Kv be the absolute Galois group of Kv .\nBy jE we denote the j-invariant of an elliptic curve.\nProposition 3.1 (Galois action on torsion of Tate curves). Let Kv be a\nv-adic complete field with residue field C and absolute Galois group Gv , and\nlet E/Kv be a Tate curve.\u0001 Then for any prime power ln , we can find a\n\u2032\nbasis (P1 , P2 ) of E[ln ] Kv such that for any integer n\u2032 with ln +1 \u2224 v(jE ),\n\u0001\nthere is an element \u03c3 \u2208 Gv which acts on E[ln ] Kv with respect to the basis\n(P1 , P2 ) like\n\u0012\n\u2032 \u0013\n1 ln\n\u2208 GL2 (Z/ln Z).\n0 1\nIn particular, for almost all prime powers ln there is a transvection, i. e.\nn\u2032 = 0.\nFurthermore, the basis (P1 , P2 ) can be chosen as follows: for P1 we may\ntake any ln -torsion point which specializes into the connected component of\none, while for P2 we may take any other point such that (P1 , P2 ) forms a\nbasis.\n\n\f6\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\nProof. Mimic the proof of [Si94, V.6.1] using Tate's v-adic Uniformization\nTheorem.\n\u0003\nFrom this we can conclude\n\u0001 that the image of the action of the\u0001 absolute\nGalois group G = Gal K/K acting on N -torsion points E[N ] K of E\u2192Y\nis huge.\nCorollary 3.2 (Galois action on torsion points of E). Let E\u2192Y be a nonisotrivial family of elliptic curves and K = C(Y ) the function field of Y .\nThen for any prime number l there is a non-negative integer n(l) such that\nfor all prime powers ln , there are elements \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 of G which act like\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n0\n1 ln(l)\nand\n0\n1\nln(l) 1\n\u0001\non E[ln ] K with respect to a suitable basis. Moreover, for almost all l, we\nmay choose n(l) = 0.\nProof. We argue as in [Ig59]. We may assume that E\u2192Y has everywhere\nsemistable reduction and a full level-ln -structure, i. e. there is an isomorphism of Y -group schemes (Z/ln Z)2Y \u2192E[ln ]. This can always be achieved\nafter a finite base change.\nChoosing a point y \u2208 Y (C) such that E\u2192Y has bad reduction in y, we\nfind by Proposition (3.1) a basis (P1 , P2 ) of E[ln ](K) such that there is an\nelement \u03c3 \u2208 G which acts with respect to (P1 , P2 ) like\n\u0012\n\u2032 \u0013\n1 ln\n\u2208 GL2 (Z/ln Z)\n0 1\n\u2032\n\nfor n\u2032 with ln +1 \u2224 v(jE ) where v is the valuation at y. Furthermore, P1\nspecializes into the connected component of one while P2 does not. So we\nmay find another point y \u2032 \u2208 Y (C) such that P2 will specialize into the\nconnected component of one, since having a full level-ln -structure E\u2192Y is\nthe pull-back of the universal elliptic curve E(ln )\u2192X(ln ) parameterizing\nfull level-ln -structures (we may assume that ln > 2 because if the statement\nis true for ln , it is also true for ln\u22121 ). So using again (3.1) we will find an\nelement \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 G which acts with respect to the basis (P2 , P1 ) like\n\u0012\n\u2032\u2032 \u0013\n1 ln\n\u2208 GL2 (Z/ln Z)\n0 1\n\u2032\u2032\n\nfor n\u2032\u2032 with ln +1 \u2224 v \u2032 (jE ) where v \u2032 is the valuation in y \u2032 . Of course upper\ntriangle matrices with respect to (P2 , P1 ) will be lower triangle matrices\nwith respect to (P1 , P2 ). So choosing n(l) such that ln(l)+1 \u2224 v(jE ) and\nln(l)+1 \u2224 v \u2032 (jE ), we find two elements \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 of GK\u0304/K which act with\nrespect to (P1 , P2 ) like\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1\n0\n1 ln(l)\n.\nand\nln(l) 1\n0\n1\n\n\fON SHIMURA CURVES IN THE SCHOTTKY LOCUS\n\n7\n\nIn particular, n(l) does only depend on l or ln and for almost all l, we may\nchoose n(l) = 0 because l \u2224 v(jE ) and l \u2224 v \u2032 (jE ).\n\u0003\nWe can conclude the shape of endomorphisms on torsion groups of E\u2192Y .\nCorollary 3.3 (Endomorphisms of torsion groups E[N ]). Let E\u2192Y be a\nnon-isotrivial family of elliptic curves. Then for any prime number l, there\nis a non-negative integer n(l) such that for all prime powers ln , every Y endomorphisms of E[ln ] is the sum of a multiplication-by-m map and a composition of the multiplication-by-ln\u2212n(l) with an endomorphism of E[ln(l) ].\nMoreover, for almost\nall l we may choose n(l) = 0 so that the endomor\u0001\nphisms EndY E[ln ] consist only of multiplication-by-m maps.\nProof. Any endomorphism of E[ln ] is invariant under the action of Galois so\nthat it has to lie in the center of the action of Galois on E[ln ]. In particular,\nan endomorphism must commute with the two matrices from Corollary (3.2).\nAn elementary matrix calculation shows that any such endomorphism has\nto be represented by a matrix of the form\nA = m * I + ln\u2212n(l) * M \u2208 Ml (Z/ln Z)\nwhere m is an integer, I is the identity matrix and M is some other matrix.\nThe interpretation is the following. m * I corresponds to the multiplicationby-m map, while ln\u2212n(l) * M is the composition of the multiplication-byln\u2212n(l) map E[ln ]\u2192E[ln(l) ] with an endomorphism of E[ln(l) ].\nMoreover, Corollary\n(3.2) says that for almost all l we have n(l) = 0 so\n\u0001\n\u0003\nthat EndY E[ln(l) ] = {0}.\nThis tells us that if the family E\u2192Y is defined over some number field,\nthen the same is true for the endomorphisms of E[N ].\n\nCorollary 3.4 (Endomorphisms of torsion groups descend). Let E\u2192Y be\na non-isotrivial family of elliptic curves defined over some number field F .\nThen there is a finite extension F \u2032 of F such that for all natural numbers N\nthe Y -endomorphisms of E[N ] are defined over F \u2032 . In particular, the field\nF \u2032 depends only on E\u2192Y .\nProof. It is enough to consider prime powers\u0001 ln . By Corollary (3.3) for almost all l the endomorphisms EndY E[ln(l) ] consist only of multiplicationby-m maps which are clearly defined over F .\nFor the finitely many remaining l, we also have to consider endomorphisms of E[ln(l) ]. Since these are finite in number, they will be defined\nover some finite extension F \u2032 of F depending only on E\u2192Y .\n\u0003\nIn particular, any family of Abelian varieties A\u2192Y which is isogenous to\na g-fold product of E\u2192Y can be defined over the number field F \u2032 .\n\n\f8\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\nProposition 3.5 (Isogenies and Abelian varieties descend). Let E\u2192Y a\nnon-isotrivial family of elliptic curves defined over some number field F .\nThen there is a finite covering Y \u2032 \u2192Y and a finite extension F \u2032 of F such\nthat for every Y -isogeny h from any g-fold product of E\u2192Y to any family\nof Abelian varieties A\u2192Y , the Y \u2032 -isogeny h\u2032 = h \u00d7Y idY \u2032 is defined over F \u2032 .\nIn particular, Y \u2032 and F \u2032 depend only on E\u2192Y and not on g.\nProof. Let H be the kernel of h. For a suitable number N , the group scheme\nH is contained in E[N ]\u00d7Y * * *\u00d7Y E[N ]. After a suitable base change Y \u2032 \u2192Y ,\nwhich may be chosen independently from H because of the finiteness result\nCorollary (3.3), we can describe H \u2032 as the kernel of an endomorphism of\nE \u2032 [N ]\u00d7Y \u2032 * * *\u00d7Y \u2032 E \u2032 [N ]. Corollary (3.4) shows that H \u2032 will be defined over F \u2032 ,\ni. e. H \u2032 is the pull-back of a subgroup scheme H0\u2032 of E0\u2032 [N ] \u00d7Y0\u2032 * * * \u00d7Y0\u2032 E0\u2032 [N ]\nwith respect to the base change Spec C\u2192Spec F \u2032 .\nNow let A\u20320 \u2192Y0\u2032 be the quotient of the g-fold product of E0\u2032 \u2192Y0\u2032 by H0\u2032\nand let h\u20320 be the quotient map. Clearly, h\u2032 and A\u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 coincide generically\nwith the pull-backs of h\u20320 and A\u20320 under the base change Spec C\u2192Spec F \u2032 .\nAlso Corollary (3.4) says that F \u2032 depends only on the family E \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 and,\ntherefore, on E\u2192Y .\n\u0003\nMoreover, we can say something about the isogenies which will occur.\nProposition 3.6 (Divisibility of the degree of isogenies). Let E\u2192Y be a\nnon-isotrivial family of elliptic curves. Then there is a finite set of primes\nS = S(E/Y ), depending only on E\u2192Y , such that for every family of Abelian\nvarieties A\u2192Y , which is Y -isogenous to a g-fold product of E\u2192Y , there is\na Y -isogeny between the g-fold product of E\u2192Y and A\u2192Y whose degree has\nonly prime divisors contained in S. In particular, the set S does not depend\non g.\nProof. Let S = S(E/Y ) be the set of primes l such that the integers n(l)\nfrom Corollary (3.2) are non-zero. Let h : E \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E\u2192A be an isogeny\nand H \u2282 Ker(h) a non-trivial simple subgroup scheme so that the order of\nG is some prime power ln .\nLet l \u2208\n/ S. If g = 1, then H \u2243 E[l] since E[l] is irreducible by Corollary\n(3.3). Thus h : E\u2192A factorizes through E \u2243 E/H\u2192A. Proceeding like\nthis, we can find an isogeny prime to all l \u2208\n/ S.\nIf g > 1, then using Corollary (3.3) we see that H maps into a factor of\nE \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E by a multiplication-by-m map. So after applying a suitable\nautomorphism of E \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E, the subgroup H lies in a g \u2212 1-dimensional\nfactor of the product. By induction we see that (E \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E)/H is\nisomorphic to E \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E.\n\u0003\nSo far, we have seen that a family of Abelian varieties which is isogenous\nto a product of a modular family of elliptic curves can be defined over a\nnumber field. Now we want to have this result for a family of curves whose\nJacobian is isogenous to a product of a modular family of elliptic curves.\n\n\fON SHIMURA CURVES IN THE SCHOTTKY LOCUS\n\n9\n\nProposition 3.7 (Curves descend). Let E\u2192Y be a non-isotrivial family\nof elliptic curves defined over a number field F . Then there is a finite\nfield extension F \u2032 of F and a curve Y \u2032 covering Y , both depending only\non E\u2192Y , such that for any family of curves C\u2192Y , whose Jacobian J\u2192Y\nis Y -isogenous to a g-fold product of E\u2192Y , there is finite covering Y \u2032\u2032 \u2192Y \u2032\nof degree at most 2, such that C \u00d7Y Y \u2032\u2032 \u2192Y \u2032\u2032 is defined over F \u2032 . In particular,\nY \u2032 and the degree of Y \u2032\u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 do not depend on g.\n\nProof. Let S = S(E/Y ) be the set of primes from Proposition (3.6) about\nthe divisibility of the degree of isogenies. Let N \u2265 3 be an integer which is\nnot divisible by any prime in S. (The choice of N will later ensure that the\nJacobian is equipped with a level-N -structure, see below.)\nAfter a finite extension Y \u2032 \u2192Y , we may assume that E \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is equipped\nwith a level-N -structure \u03b1\u2032 . By further extending Y \u2032 \u2192Y we may also assume that the conclusion of Proposition (3.5) about descending isogenies\nand Abelian varieties holds. The extension Y \u2032 \u2192Y depends only on E\u2192Y .\nNow let C\u2192Y be a curve whose Jacobian J\u2192Y is Y -isogenous to a g-fold\nproduct of E\u2192Y . We may assume by Proposition (3.6) that there is a Y isogeny h from E \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E to J whose degree has only prime divisors in\nS. Thus, the level-N -structure \u03b1\u2032 will be mapped under h\u2032 injectively into\nJ \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 so that J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 itself is equipped with a level-N -structure which we\nwill call \u03b2 \u2032 .\nBy Proposition (3.5) and the choice of Y \u2032 , we see that J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 together\nwith its principal polarization \u03b8 \u2032 (which is just a special kind of isogeny)\nare defined over F \u2032 . Also the level-N -structure \u03b2 \u2032 on J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is defined over\nF \u2032 since it is the image of the level-N -structure \u03b1\u2032 of E \u2032 \u00d7Y \u2032 * * * \u00d7Y \u2032 E \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032\nunder h\u2032 . So, the triple (J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 , \u03b8 \u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 ) is defined over F \u2032 .\nThe canonical morphism between fine moduli spaces\n(N )\n\n)\nj (N ) : M(N\ng \u2192Ag,1\n\nwhich sends a curve with level-N -structure to its principally polarized Jacobian with the same level-N -structure is 2-to-1 over its image for g \u2265 3\nrespectively 1-to-1 for g = 2, see [OS80]. Hence, the curve C \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 can be\ndefined over F \u2032 after applying a base change Y \u2032\u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 of degree at most 2.\nAs mentioned above, the choice of Y \u2032 and F \u2032 depend only on the family\nof elliptic curves E\u2192Y .\n\u0003\nSo we see that a family of curves, whose Jacobian is isogenous to the g-fold\nproduct of a modular family of curves, can be defined over a number field\nafter a finite base change of degree at most 2. And the number field does\nnot depend on the given family of curves but only on the modular family of\nelliptic curves.\n\n\f10\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\n4. Reduction to finite fields\nLet C\u2192Y be a family of curves, i. e. a flat, projective morphism whose\ngeneric fiber is smooth and geometrically connected. Assume that the Jacobian J\u2192Y is Y -isogenous to the g-fold product E \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E of a modular\nfamily of elliptic curves E\u2192Y .\nBecause of Theorem (3.7) we may assume that our base field is a number\nfield F . We want to show that there is a finite prime of F such that the\ne Ye obtained by reduction modulo this prime has a also a smooth\nfamily C\u2192\ngeneric fiber. It is clearly possible to find such a prime depending on the\ngiven family C\u2192Y . But we want to show that there is a choice of this\nprime which depends only on E\u2192Y and not on C\u2192Y or g, so that for any\nfamily C\u2192Y of arbitrarily large genus g, whose Jacobian is Y -isogenous to\ne Ye will still be generically smooth.\nE \u00d7Y * * * \u00d7Y E, its reduction C\u2192\nTherefor we need a criterion for the generic smoothness of a family of\ncurves C\u2192Y after reduction modulo a prime. The characterization is given\nin terms of the existence of certain endomorphisms on the principally polarized Jacobian J\u2192Y of C\u2192Y .\nIn this section we consider all schemes, morphisms and fiber products to\nlive over an at most 1-dimensional base scheme S which is suppressed from\nthe notation.\nDefinition 4.1 (Split principally polarized Abelian variety). A principally\npolarized Abelian variety (A, \u03bbA ) splits if there are two positive-dimensional\nprincipally polarized Abelian varieties (B, \u03bbB ) and (C, \u03bbC ) such that (A, \u03bbA )\nis isomorphic to (B \u00d7 C, \u03bbB \u00d7 \u03bbC ) as a principally polarized Abelian variety.\nFor the next proposition, we assume that S is the spectrum of an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic.\nNote that a smooth curve C has a proper Jacobian J. But the converse\nis not true, since e. g. two smooth curves intersecting transversally in one\npoint also have a proper Jacobian. So we need a criterion to distinguish\nbetween these cases.\nProposition 4.2 (Reducibility criterion for curves). Let C be a curve with\nproper Jacobian (J, \u03bb). Then C is reducible if and only if (J, \u03bb) splits as a\nprincipally polarized Abelian variety.\nProof. If C has a proper Jacobian then it is either smooth or it consists of\nsmooth irreducible components Ci intersecting in a way such that they form\na tree. Hence, if C is reducible, then (J, \u03bb) is the product of the Jacobians\n(Ji , \u03bbi ) of the smooth components Ci .\nIt remains to show the converse that C is reducible if (J, \u03bb) splits. Assume\nthat (J, \u03bb) = (A1 \u00d7 A2 , \u03bb1 \u00d7 \u03bb2 ) where (Ai , \u03bbi ) are positive-dimensional\nprincipally polarized Abelian varieties and that C is smooth.

To show that it is\nalready split before reduction we want to lift the endomorphism.\nLet S = Spec R be the spectrum of a henselian discrete valuation ring\nwith quotient field K and residue field k. We use the following notational\nconvention. A small subscript denotes the base scheme. So the schemes XK\nand Xk are schemes over Spec K and Spec k, respectively. A Scheme over S\nis simply denoted by X instead of XS . Then XK is its general fiber and Xk\nis its special fiber. Let A\u2192S be an Abelian scheme. The question we will\nstudy is when does an endomorphism of Ak lift to an endomorphism of AK .\nDefinition 4.4 (The lifting property). We say that every endomorphism of\nAk lifts if the restriction map\nEndS (A) \u2212\u2192 Endk (Ak )\nf\n7\u2212\u2192 fk := f|Ak\nis an isomorphism.\nExample 4.5. If E \u2192 S is a relative elliptic curve such that EK and Ek\nare both elliptic curves without complex multiplication so that the endomorphism rings EndS (E) and Endk (Ek ) are isomorphic to Z, then the restriction\nmap is an isomorphism because the endomorphisms are the multiplicationby-m maps.\nThe same is true for the g-fold product of the elliptic curve E since in this\ncase any endomorphism is build up from multiplication-by-m maps which\nlift.\nThe lifting property is invariant under \u00e9tale isogenies.\n\n\f14\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\nProposition 4.6 (The lifting property and \u00e9tale isogenies). Let A and B\nbe two principally polarized Abelian schemes over S and h : A\u2192B an \u00e9tale\nS-isogeny. If every endomorphism of Ak lifts, then every endomorphism of\nBk lifts too.\nProof. Look at the commutative diagram\nEndS\u007f (B) \u001f\n\nh\u2217\n\n\u007f\n\n_\n\n/ EndS (A)\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u000f\n\nEndk (Bk ) \u001f\n\n\u007f\n\nh\u2217k\n\n\u000f\n\n/ Endk (Ak )\n\nwhere h\u2217 is given by f 7\u2192 h\u2217 f := h\u2020 \u25e6 f \u25e6 h and h\u2217k is the analogous map for\nendomorphisms of the special fiber. Let fk \u2208 Endk (Bk ) be an endomorphism\nof Bk . We want to lift fk to an endomorphism f \u2208 EndS (B) so that f|Bk =\nfk . Look at the map h\u2217k fk \u2208 Endk (Ak ). Since A has the lifting property,\nu\nthe map h\u2217k fk lifts to a map A \u2192 A so that uk = h\u2217k fk . If we can show\nu\nthat A \u2192 A lies in the image of h\u2217 , i. e. there is a map f \u2208 EndS (B)\nwith h\u2217 f = h\u2020 \u25e6 f \u25e6 h = u, then the map f is a lifting of fk because of the\ncommutativity of the diagram above.\nWe know that uk = h\u2217k fk = h\u2020k \u25e6 fk \u25e6 hk factorizes through hk so that\nKer(hk ) is a subgroup scheme of Ker(uk ). Since our base S is henselian\nand Ker(hk ) \u00e9tale, there is a subgroup scheme G \u2282 Ker(u) such that Gk =\nKer(hk ). But then, being a subgroup scheme of A, the group scheme G\nhas to coincide with Ker(h) since finite \u00e9tale schemes over S are uniquely\ndetermined by their special fiber [Mi80, p.34]. Hence, u factorizes through\ng\nh, i. e. there is a map B \u2192 A such that u = g \u25e6 h holds.\nAnalogously one shows that the dual b\ng of g factorizes through the dual hb\u2020\nf\n\nof h\u2020 . Hence, there exists an endomorphism B \u2192 B such that g = h\u2020 \u25e6 f is\nvalid. Therefore, we get the identity u = h\u2217 f and f becomes a lifting of fk .\nThis implies that the Abelian scheme B also has the lifting property.\n\u0003\n\nIn particular, Abelian schemes isogenous to a g-fold product of a relative\nelliptic curve without complex multiplication have the lifting property.\nLet us return to our situation in the beginning of this section.

Of course, also EK \u2192 Spec K extends to a\n(N\u00e9ron) model E \u2192 Spec R with special fiber Ek \u2192 Spec k.\nWith a view towards Proposition (3.7), we want to allow our curve C to\nbe defined over some finite field extension K \u2032 of K rather than over K itself.\nTherefore, let Y \u2032 \u2192Y be the map of minimal arithmetic surfaces induced by\nSpec K \u2032 \u2192Spec K, so that K \u2032 is the function field of Y \u2032 . Let YF\u2032q be the fiber\nof Y \u2032 \u2192Spec OF over the point Spec Fq \u2192Spec OF , k\u2032 the function field of an\nirreducible component of YF\u2032 q and R\u2032 the local ring of Y \u2032 at this irreducible\ncomponent. We can extend CK \u2032 to a model C \u2032 \u2192Spec R\u2032 and denote its\nspecial fiber by Ck\u2032 .\nTheorem 4.7 (Reduction to finite fields). Let EK be a non-isotrivial elliptic\ncurve.

Let K \u2032 be a finite extension of K such that JK \u2032 becomes the Jacobian\nof a projective and geometrically connected curve CK \u2032 . Then CK \u2032 is smooth\nover K \u2032 if and only if its reduction Ck\u2032 with respect to Spec Fq \u2192Spec OF is\nsmooth over k\u2032 .\nProof. First, we start with the case K \u2032 = K. We choose a finite point\nSpec Fq \u2192 Spec OF of residue characteristic p such that the following properties are fulfilled.\n\n\f16\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\n(1) YF has good reduction at Spec Fq , i. e. the fiber YFq is a smooth curve.\nThis depends only on K \u2013 the function field of YF \u2013 and is true for\nalmost all points of Spec OF .\n(2) EK \u2192 Spec K extends to a smooth proper model E \u2192 Spec R such\nthat Ek \u2192 Spec k is a non-isotrivial elliptic curve.

Using Proposition (3.6) we see that this is true for almost\nall points of Spec OF and depends only on EK . Together with (2) this\nproperty will enable us to lift endomorphisms of Jk to endomorphisms\nof JK with the help of Proposition (4.6).\nSince the three conditions above hold separately for all but finitely many\npoints of Spec OF , we can find a point Spec Fq \u2192 Spec OF fulfilling all\nconditions simultaneously. The choice of this point depends only on EK .\nAs explained above, let R be the local ring of Y at YFq . Extend the curve\nCK \u2192 Spec K to a minimal model C \u2192 Spec R.

By Proposition (4.2), the reducibility of the curve is equivalent to the splitting of its\nJacobian. By Proposition (4.3), the splitting is equivalent to the existence\nof a symmetric idempotent endomorphism of the Jacobian.\nSince Proposition (4.6) tells us that JKb has the lifting property, a symmetric idempotent endomorphism exists on JKb if and only if it exists on\nb if necessary). Hence CK is\nJk (apply a finite base change Spec Sb \u2192 Spec R\nsmooth over K if and only if Ck is smooth over k.\nNow, if K \u2032 is a finite extension of K, with the same choice of prime\nSpec Fq \u2192Spec OF , as above, the Jacobian JK\nc\u2032 still has the lifting property.\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nSo, replacing K, R, k by K , R , k , respectively, verbatim the same argument,\nas before, shows that CK \u2032 is smooth over K \u2032 if and only if Ck\u2032 is smooth\nover k\u2032 .\n\u0003\ne of Ck over Ye = YFq , the generIn particular, taking the minimal model C\nically smooth family of curves C\u2192Y induces a corresponding generically\ne Ye over a suitable finite field Fq , which does not\nsmooth family of curves C\u2192\ndepend on C\u2192Y .

Then any\nFqn -rational point of Y has at least one Fqrn -rational preimage with r \u2264 d.\nSo applying the Sato-Tate-conjecture on E \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 , which is the extension of\nE\u2192Y with respect to the base change Y \u2032 \u2192Y , we see that\nn\nn\n\u03c0o\n\u03c0o\n\u2265 # y \u2208 Y (Fqn ) 0 \u2264 \u0398(y) <\n> \u03b5q n\n# y \u2208 Y \u2032 (Fqdn ) 0 \u2264 \u0398(y) <\n2\n2d\nwhere \u03b5 > 0 is some constant depending only on d. Now verbatim the same\ncounting as above gives us a constant c = c(E/Y, d), depending only on\nE\u2192Y and d, such that C \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 has at least c * logloglogg g singularities.\n\u0003\nIt follows that the genus g of such families of curves has to be bounded.\nTheorem 5.6 (The genus is bounded). Let E\u2192Y be a non-isotrivial family\nof elliptic curves and C \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 a family of curves of genus g defined over a\ncovering Y \u2032 \u2192Y of degree at most d. Assume that the Jacobian J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 of\nC \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is Y \u2032 -isogenous to the g-fold product of E \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 . Then the genus of\nC \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is bounded, i. e. there is a constant B = B(E/Y, d), depending only\non E\u2192Y and d, such that g is smaller than B.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that E\u2192Y has semistable\nreduction everywhere. If not, we can achieve this after a finite base change\nusing the semistable reduction theorem.\nLet J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 be the family of Jacobians of C \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 . By assumption J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is\n\u2032\nY -isogenous to the g-fold product of E \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 . Hence, J \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 has semistable\nreduction and, therefore, the family of curves C \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032 is semistable. So by\n(5.5) and (5.2) the number \u03b4 of singularities in the geometric fibers of C\u2192Y\nsatisfies (notice that h(E \u2032 ) \u2264 d * h(E))\nc0\n\nlog g\n* g \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 12d * h(E) * g\nlog log g\n\n\fON SHIMURA CURVES IN THE SCHOTTKY LOCUS\n\n21\n\nwhere the constant c0 > 0 depends only on E\u2192Y and d. But then g cannot\nbe arbitrarily large, since the left hand side is not linearly bounded by g. So\nthere is a constant B depending only on E\u2192Y and d such that g is smaller\nthan B.\n\u0003\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe come to the results announced in the introduction. Our base field is\nnow C again.\nTheorem 6.1 (Bound for the genus). Let C\u2192Y be a family of curves of\ngenus g whose Jacobian J\u2192Y is Y -isogenous to the g-fold product of a nonisotrivial family of elliptic curves E\u2192Y which can be defined over a number\nfield. Then the genus g is bounded, i. e. there is a number B = B(E/Y )\ndepending only on E\u2192Y such that g is smaller than B.\nProof. Using Proposition (3.7) we see that after replacing Y by a finite\ncovering, there is a covering Y \u2032 \u2192Y of degree at most 2 such that C \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032\ncan be defined over a number field F which depend only on E\u2192Y .\nTheorem (4.7) tells us that there is a finite prime Spec Fq \u2192Spec OF ,\nwhose choice depends only on E\u2192Y , such that the reduction of C \u2032 \u2192Y \u2032\nf\u2032 \u2192Y\nf\u2032 of curves of genus g over Fq whose\nmodulo this prime yields a family C\nf\u2032 -isogenous to the g-fold product of the reduction E\nf\u2032 \u2192Y\nf\u2032 of\nJacobian is Y\nE\u2192Y .\nf\u2032 \u2192Y\nf\u2032 there is a number B, depending only\nBy Theorem (5.6) applied to C\non E\u2192Y , such that g is smaller than B.\n\u0003\nComing to Shimura curves, we first give a finiteness statement about\nmodular families of elliptic curves.\nProposition 6.2 (Finiteness of modular families of elliptic curves). Fix\ntwo integers q and s. Then there are only finitely many semistable modular\nfamilies of elliptic curves E\u2192Y defined over a base curve Y of genus at\nmost q and smooth outside a set S \u2282 Y of cardinality at most s.\nj\n\nE\nProof. Let E\u2192Y be a modular family as in the proposition and let Y \u2212\u2192\nP1C\nbe the j-map corresponding to the family E\u2192Y . Because of the semistability of E\u2192Y , an application of the ABC-conjecture for function fields yields\n\ndeg(jE ) \u2264 6 * (2q \u2212 2 + s) =: d.\nSo, in particular, the degree of the j-map is absolutely bounded by d. Therefore, the modular family of elliptic curves E\u2192Y is given by a subgroup\n\u0393 \u2282 SL2 (Z) of index at most d.\n\n\f22\n\nS. KUKULIES\n\nSince SL2 (Z) is finitely generated, there are only finitely many subgroups\n\u0393 of SL2 (Z) of index at most d. Thus, we have only finitely many semistable\nmodular families of elliptic curves E\u2192Y over a curve of genus at most q and\nsmooth outside a set of cardinality at most s.\n\u0003\nExample 6.3. Let q = 0 so that Y = P1C . Beauville showed that for s \u2264 3\nthere are no non-isotrivial semistable families of elliptic curves at all. And for\ns = 4, Beauville showed that there are exactly six non-isotrivial semistable\nfamilies of elliptic curves, all modular, corresponding to the congruence subgroups \u0393(3), \u03931 (4) \u2229 \u0393(2), \u03931 (5), \u03931 (6), \u03930 (8) \u2229 \u03931 (4) and \u03930 (9) \u2229 \u03931 (3), see\n[Be82].\nSo, if the family of Jacobians is Y -isogenous to the g-fold product of\na modular family of elliptic curves, then we get the following result from\nTheorem (6.1).\nCorollary 6.4 (Uniform bound for modular families). Fix two integers q\nand s. Then there is a constant B = B(q, s) such that for any semistable\nfamily of curves C\u2192Y , which is defined over a base curve Y of genus at\nmost q and whose family of Jacobians J\u2192Y is smooth outside a set S \u2282 Y\nof cardinality at most s and Y -isogenous to the g-fold product of a modular\nfamily of elliptic curves E\u2192Y , the genus g of the fibers of C\u2192Y is bounded\nabove by B. In particular, B depends only on q and s.\nProof. By Proposition (6.2), there are only finitely many semistable modular\nfamilies of elliptic curves E\u2192Y over a curve of genus at most q and smooth\noutside a set of cardinality at most s. Because of the modularity, each one\ncan be defined over some number field [De79].\nSo Theorem (6.1) gives for each E\u2192Y , a bound B(E/Y ) such that for\ng larger than B(E/Y ), the g-fold product of E\u2192Y is not Y -isogenous to\na Jacobian. Thus, taking B = B(q, s) to be the maximum of these finitely\nmany numbers B(E/Y ) proves the corollary.\n\u0003\nWe derive the following corollary.\nCorollary 6.5 (Curves over P1C with strict maximal Higgs field). Given an\ninteger s \u2265 0, there is a natural number B = B(s), depending only on s,\nsuch that for any semistable family of curves C\u2192P1C , whose Jacobian J\u2192P1C\nis smooth outside a set S \u2282 P1C of cardinality at most s and has a strictly\nmaximal Higgs field, the genus g of the fibers of C\u2192P1C is bounded above by\nthe number B.\nProof. Because of Corollary (2.3), we may choose B = B(s) to be the constant B(0, s) from Corollary (6.4).\n\u0003\nIn particular, a given rational Shimura curve parameterizing a family of\nhigh-dimensional Abelian varieties with strictly maximal Higgs field does\nnot lie in the closure of the Schottky locus. This proves Theorem (1.1).\n\n\fON SHIMURA CURVES IN THE SCHOTTKY LOCUS\n\n23\n\nReferences\nBeauville, A.: Les familles stables de courbes elliptiques sur P 1 admettant quatre fibres singuli\u00e8res.
