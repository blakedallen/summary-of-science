As the model example, the measurement of\ndichotomic S observable \u039b is considere for two S ensembles; first one include\nthe pure states which are the superposition of \u039b eigenstates |\u03bb1,2 i, other one\nis the probabilistic mixture of this states. It is shown that the information\nconstraints induced by Heisenberg commutation relations bloke the transfer of\ninformation about the purity of S state, for the studied ensembles it is characterized by the expectation value of \u039b\u2032 observable conjugated to \u039b. Due to\nthese restrictions, O can't discriminate the pure and mixed S ensembles with\nthe same \u039b\u0304. It demonstrated that these information losses result in the appearance of stochasticity in the measurement of S pure state, so that in the\nindividual events O would detect the random 'pointer' values O1,2 , which correspond to the outcomes for O measurement of incoming |\u03bb1,2 i. The influence\nof O decoherence by its environment is studied, it's shown that the account of\nits effects doesn't change these results principally.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuantum mechanics (QM) after more than 90 years of its development achieved the\ntremendous success in the description of nature. However, its foundations are still disputed extensively and seems to contain some unsettled questions [1, 2, 3]. The most\nfamous and oldest of them is the State collapse or Quantum measurement problem\n[4, 5, 6]. In our paper this problem will be considered mainly within the framework\n1\n\n\fof information theory [7, 8]. Really, the measurement of parameters characterizing\nan arbitrary system S includes the transfer of information from S to the information\nsystem O (Observer) which processes and memorizes it. Correspondingly, in information theory any measuring system (MS) can be described as the information channel\nwhich transfers the information about S state to O [7, 8].\nPlainly, if some restrictions on the information transfer via such channel exist, such\nlosses can influence the content of signals percepted by O after the measurement.\nIt was shown earlier that such constraints, which induced formally by Heisenberg\ncommutation relations, influence essentially the functioning of typical information\nchannels [11, 13]. However, until now the influence of this effect on the outcome of\nquantum measurements wasn't analyzed at the proper mathematical level. In our\nprevious papers for the simple MS model it was shown that such restrictions result\nin the loss of information characterizing the rate of S state purity, so it becomes\nimpossible for O to discriminate the pure and mixed ensembles of incoming S states.\nIt was demonstrated that for individual events such information losses result in the\nunavoidable stochasticity of the measurement outcomes for S pure states [9, 10].\nThe information-theoretical approach of system self-description or 'measurement\nfrom inside' is applied to the description of information acquisition by O in quantum\nmeasurements [6, 8]. In Schroedinger QM framework, it realized by means of the formalism of restrictive maps in MS Hilbert space [5, 6]. Here we develop our formalism\nand discuss its main features in detail. In particular, the influence of O decoherence\nby its environment will be considered briefly for simple MS model. As the result, we\nshall argue that such approach allows to construct the consistent measurement theory,\nin which the stochasticity appears without exploit of axiomatic reduction of quantum\nstates in Schroedinger QM scheme. Below such formalism without reduction axiom\nis called linear QM formalism.\nIt's acknowledged now that Operator algebra called also Algebraic QM is the most\ndeep and universal theory, which in the same mathematical setting describes successfully classical physics, QM and QFT [4]. However, C \u2217 -algebra formalism exploited\nin it is complicated and abstract which makes the discussion of QM fundamental\naspects in its framework rather difficult. Because of it, in this paper Schr\u00f6dinger QM\nformalism is used for the description of information transfer in quantum measurements. We plan to reconsider these problems in C \u2217 -algebra formalism in forcoming\npaper, some results on it can be found in [9]. It was proposed earlier in general\nphilosophical and logical setting that the incompleteness of O information can be the\npossible reason of wave function collapse, but no consistent proof of this hypothesis\nor model calculations weren't published ([5, 6] and refs. therein). It's worth to notice beforehand that even if O is taken to be the human brain, in our approach the\nobserver's consciousness doesn't play any role and will not be referred to at all. We\nassume that the brain obeys the standard QM laws; some aspects of this problem\nwill be discussed in conclusion. However, for the illustrative purposes some terms\ncharacteristic for conscious analysis of signals will be used in the description of our\ntheory.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nModels of Quantum Measurements\n\nHere our measurement model will be described and some aspects of QM measurements\ntheory will be reviewed. We shall also formulate the main ideas of our approach\nin semi-qualitative form, the corresponding detailed formalism is presented in the\nnext section. Our analysis will be concentrated on the study of individual quantum\nmeasurements, so it's worth to remind the properties of individual quantum states.\nWe shall consider here only such states, which can be prepared 'event by event' by the\nexperimentalist in the ideal scheme of state preparation. For the finite-dimensional\nsystem S they are the pure states (rays) in S Hilbert space HS [1]. Only such state\ncan't be decomposed as the probabilistic mixture of two or more other individual\nstates. For the statistical or ensemble quantum states such restriction is absent, their\neffects are described by the density matrix \u03c1, i.e. the positive trace one operator\non HS . In case when the procedure of such ensemble preparation is well-defined,\nits statistical states admits the objective decomposition into the individual states in\nform of gemenge [1]. The quantum observables, which will be considered here, are\nthe linear, self-adjoint (PV) operators on H; POV generalization of QM observables\nis unimportant for our approach and will not be used here.\nIt's worth to remind also how the individual measurements are characterized in\ninformation theory. In this case the amount of information transferred from S to\nO is practically unimportant, and their analysis is concentrated on the distinctions\nbetween the individual signals. In the simplest case the signal \u0398O induced by the\nmeasured state of S and detected by O in event n is described by the array of real\nparameters called the information pattern (IP) J(n) = {e1 , ..., el } [16]. The difference\nbetween two individual measured S states for O is reflected by the difference of their\nIPs, their complete set called IP space. J(n) is the set of subjective O parameters,\nin general their relation with S, O dynamical parameters isn't straightforward and\nunambiguous, in particular, J(n) can be their stochastic function [8]. It supposed\nthat the corresponding sequence of logical operations stipulates O recognition of S\nsignals described by J(n). Usually, it is admitted implicitly that O physical structure\npermits to perform such operations, but for quantum O models studied here this is\nthe additional assumption. Of course, if such simple description of O quantum signals\nby IPs will turn out to be incomplete, it can be changed to more complicated one.\nIn particular, for quantum objects S and O some of IP parameters, in principle, can\nbe uncertain, yet as will be shown, this possibility is unimportant for the studied\nproblem.\n\n2.1\n\nMicroscopic MS Model\n\nThe quantum measurements are theoretically studied by means of specific microscopic models; despite the significant simplifications in comparison with the practical\ndevices, such models successfully reproduce some their important features [1, 15]. In\nthis approach the elementary system S during its measurement interacts with the\nmodel detector D, which is the quantum object with a few (usually one) degrees\nof freedom (DF). In our model MS consists of S, detector D and the information\n3\n\n\fgaining and utilizing system (IGUS) O, which processes and stores the incoming D\nsignals. In general, O can be supposedly treated as the quantum object, and so MS\nis described by the quantum state \u03c1(t) in arbitrary reference frame (RF). It will be\nargued that the effects of MS decoherence by the environment [15] aren't principal\nfor our theory, so they will be considered in the final part of our paper. S is taken\nto be the particle with the spin 21 and the measurement of its projection Sz will be\nstudied. Its u, d eigenstates denoted |s1,2 i, so that the measured S pure state is:\n\u03c8s = a1 |s1 i + a2 |s2 i\n\n(1)\n\nFor the comparison the measurement of incoming u, d 'test' mixed ensemble with\nthe same S\u0304z will be studied also. Such S ensemble is described by the gemenge\nW s = {|si i, Pi }, where Pi = |ai |2 are the probabilities of |si i in this ensemble [1], its\ndensity matrix denoted \u03c1smix . Normally, the detector amplifies S amplitude to the\nlevel accessible for O processing, here for the simplicity it just doubles it. D states are\nalso described by Dirac vector |Di in two-dimensional Hilbert space HD . Its basis is\nconstituted by |D1,2 i eigenstates of Q 'pointer' observable; the auxiliary observables\nare denoted Qx,y . The initial D state is:\n1\n|D0 i = \u221a (|D1 i + |D2 i)\n2\nIt is supposed that S, D interaction starts at t0 and finishes effectively at some\nt1 = t0 + \u03c4 . For Zurek S, D hamiltonian HS,D with the parameters tuned optimally\nfor given \u03c4 the measurement of S eigenstate |s1,2 i induces the final product state:\n\u03a81,2\nC = |s1,2 i|D1,2 i\n\n(2)\n\nin which D 'pointer' observable Q has the eigenvalues q1,2 . From the linearity of\nSchr\u00f6dinger evolution it follows that for arbitrary \u03c8s such S, D interaction will result\nin S, D entangled final state [15]:\n\u03a8S,D =\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\nai |si i|Di i\n\n(3)\n\nIf a1,2 6= 0, then D separate state \u2206D also can be formally defined, however, due to\nS, D entanglement, D and S properties can't be completely factorized. It admitted\nusually that \u2206D coincides with D reduced state, i.e. the partial trace over 'external'\nDFs, which for \u03a8S,D is equal to:\ne\nRD\n\n=\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\n|ai |2 |Di ihDi |\n\n(4)\n\nin terms of density matrixes. This expression is rather obvious for D statistical state,\nbut for the individual state such definition seems to be controversial, first of all,\ne\nbecause RD\nisn't the pure state in HD . This formal difficulty, in fact, is unimportant,\nbecause in all calculations \u03a8S,D can be used in place of \u2206D . The proper ansatz\n4\n\n\ffor the separate states will be discussed below, until then it will be no need to use\nit. D, O interaction and the resulting O information acquisition will be considered\nin detail in the next section, for the moment it will be enough to suppose that its\nperformance corresponds to common sense notions about observers and signals. To\nillustrate it, let us consider the measurement of S eigenstate |s1,2 i, which results in the\nfactorized S, D state \u03a81,2\nC of (2). For them Q eigenvalues q1,2 are D real (objective)\nproperties independent of further measurements [1]. It means that the difference\nbetween such D states is also objective and is equivalent to the one between the\nvalues 1/0 of some parameter Lg , which in this case corresponds to the eigenvalues\nof Q orthogonal projector \u03a0D\n1 . Therefore, it is natural to suppose that for suitable\nO\nchoice of D, O interaction O can percept |D1,2 i states as IP J1,2\ncomponent e1 = q1,2 ,\n\u2032\nor some qi function with the corresponding values q1,2 ; it can be called the objective\ndiscrimination of individual D states. In principle, IP J O can include also some other\n1,2\nparameters ei which has the same values both for \u03a8C\n, so here they are unimportant.\nNote that in the regarded set-up O directly measures not Sz , but D observable Q,\nwhich expectation value Q\u0304 for arbitrary S state is equal to S\u0304z ; it means that such\nmeasurement has the hierarchic structure.\n\n2.2\n\nMeasurement of eigenstate superposition\n\nNow let's consider Sz measurements when both a1,2 6= 0, i.e. \u03c8s of (1) is |si i superposition. The entangled state \u03a8S,D of (3) includes the terms proportional to both\n|D1,2 i components, which correspond to the positions q1,2 of detector pointer. Thus,\nsuch final state isn't Q eigenstate and it's not clear what is the measurement outcome\nin this case. The first thorough study of this situation was done by Schroedinger in\nhis seminal paper [14]. To illustrate it, he has compared such macroscopic states\nwith the states of alive and dead cat. He formulated notorious 'Schroedinger cat'\nparadox as following: '\u03a8-function of the whole system describes the situation when\nthe dead and alive cats, if it possible to tell so, are mixed simultaneously in the equal\nproportions'(here 'mixed' is understood in nonprobabilistic sense). Basing on this\nconsiderations, Schroedinger has concluded that to avoid such confusing and controversial outcomes the Reduction postulate (RP) should be added to QM formalism\n[14]. The similar train of arguments repeated in many books and reviews, however,\nto our knowledge the consistent proof of RP necessity never was presented in detailed\nmathematical form. We shall consider it here in the information-theoretical framework starting from the following question: given that such superpositon of dead and\nalive cat can be percepted by O, how exactly it would look like ? In particular, what\nis the quantitative difference between its signal detected by O, and the signals from\nthe eigenstates which are the superposition components?\nIn our model such Q eigenstates are \u03a81,2\nC of (2), the state \u03a8S,D of (3) which describes D1 , D2 superposition is truly different from this states, but it doesn't mean\nautomatically that they can be discriminated by O as the different signals. To demonstrate it, let us suppose that, on the opposite, O really percepts \u03a8S,D as the superposition of |D1,2 i. It supposes that O would acquire \u03a8S,D signal \u0398\u2032O , which for\nO is somehow different from both \u03a81,2\nC signals. As was admitted above, the sig5\n\n\fO\nnals of Q eigenstates are identified by O as IP J1,2\n, i.e. as the set of real paramei\nters e in each event. In the framework of Boolean logic, the signal different from\nO\nthem: \u0398\u2032O = .not.J1,2\ncan be also characterized as some set of real parameters or\nO\nO\nIP Js 6= J1,2 . To obey this condition, JsO should include at least one parameter ei ,\n1,2\nwhich value g0 for \u03a8S,D is different from its values g1,2 for \u03a8C\n. At its best, it should\nbe such parameter ei which is equal to 1 or 0 depending on the presence/absence of\n|Di i superpositions. Meanwhile, in QM all variable parameters of the system, i.e.\nobservables correspond to the self-adjoint (PV) operators. Therefore, if O performs\nthe objective discrimination of described D states, such ei should correspond to the\neigenvalue of some S, D observable G. Hence one should search the set (algebra) of\nS, D observables looking for the suitable candidates [9]. Since O interacts directly\nonly with D, it is reasonable to start this check from D observables. |D1,2 i exhaust\nall Q eigenstates spectra, so it can't be some other Q eigenvalue different from q1,2 ,\nthen such D observable G 6= Q. For any other G candidate the following equations\nshould hold [10]:\n\n\u011c\u03a8S,D = a1 \u011c|s1 i|D1 i + a2 \u011c|s2 i|D2 i = g0 \u03a8S,D\n\n1,2\n1,2\n= g1,2 \u03a8C\n\u011c\u03a8C\n\n(5)\n\nP\n\nand g0 6= g1,2 . In this case \u03a8S,D = ai \u03a8iC , so the second equation can be substituted\ninto first one. It follows that such equations can't be fulfilled simultaneously not only\nfor any nontrivial D observable but also for arbitrary joint S, D observable. Hence\neven if to admit that O can measure an arbitrary D observable G simultaneously\n1,2\nwith Q, no such measurement would permit to discriminate \u03a8C\nfrom \u03a8S,D of (3), at\nleast, in the same sense as \u03a81C is discriminated from \u03a82C , i.e. to perform their objective discrimination. The hypothetic parameters, which values for such states would\nreflect such difference, correspond to the nonlinear operators, yet their observation\ncontradicts to QM axiomatic.\nThus, contrary to the naive expectations there is no D signals, which permit O\nto detect the superpositions of Sz eigenstates simultaneously with Sz measurement.\nO\nMoreover, in this approach any IP, which differs from J1,2\n, doesn't correspond to\nphysically consistent final S, D states in Sz measurement. Yet any Sz measurement\nshould have some outcome for O, in addition, for large ensemble of events N \u2192 \u221e\nthe expectation value of JsO should converge to some realistic limit. It seems that\nunder this circumstances the only sensible solution is to suppose that for arbitrary\n\u03c8s after Sz measurement IP JsO for O will be equal at random to one of q1,2 . Hence\nafter such individual Sz measurement O can't find any difference between \u03a8S,D state\nand the stochastic state:\n\u03a6S,D = \u03a81C \u222a \u03a82C\nOf course, at this stage this is just plausible hypothesis which still to be proved. To\nagree with Born rule for \u03c8s ensemble O should observe q1,2 outcomes at random with\nprobabilities P1,2 = |a1,2 |2 . Concerning with S, D observables, which aren't just D\nobservables, no S observable, except Sz , can be measured by O, because in this set-up\nS doesn't interact with O. From the same reason the joint S, D observables are also\nunavailable for the measurement by O simultaneously with Sz . But even if they are\n6\n\n\favailable, as follows from (5), no one of them can be discriminated by O as g0 6= g1,2 .\nIn particular, for arbitrary a1,2 the considered \u03a8S,D is the degenerate eigenstate of\nS, D observable Sz \u2217 Q, but in this case g0 = g1,2 . The role of joint S, D observables\nin the measurements will be discussed below in detail.\nThis semi-qualitative analysis reveals the weak points of standard arguments in\nfavor of axiomatic state reduction in QM formalism. It turns out that even without\nRP the detection of Sz eigenstate superposition during Sz measurements is at least\nquite doubtful possibility. Of course, this considerations still don't prove the opposite\nstatement, rather they demonstrate the need of careful study of measurement process\nunder the different angles, first of all, concerned with the proper inclusion of O\ninto MS scheme at the quantum level. In the next section this question will be\nconsidered in detail, in particular, the consistency of objective discrimination used\nhere. Meanwhile, the main method of the derivations will be the same as was used\nhere: to explore whether MS observable algebra contain PV operators which can\ndiscriminate the pure and mixed MS states after the measurement.\nFor our study it's worth to have the statistical estimate of state discrimination\nin the measurement of particular observable. Such statistical measure for two finitedimensional states \u03c11,2 and observable \u039b can be described as the intersection (overlap)\nof their \u03bbi eigenvalue distributions:\nK(\u039b) =\n\nX\n\n1\n\n[w1 (\u03bbi )w2 (\u03bbi )] 2\n\n(6)\n\nhere w1,2 (\u03bbi ) = T r\u03c11,2 \u03a0(\u03bbi ) where \u03a0(\u03bbi ) is the orthogonal projector on \u03bbi . In particular, the difference between the pure and mixed S states is indicated by S observables,\nwhich expectation value is sensitive to the presence of the component interference.\nFor the regarded S pure/mixed states with the same S\u0304z they are Sx,y linear forms.\nFor example, if aa21 is real, the maximal distinction reveals Sx observable, for which\n|S\u0304x | = |a1 ||a2 | for the pure states and S\u0304x = 0 for the mixture. In this case their\noverlap\nK(Sx ) = 1 \u2212 |a1 ||a2 |\nFor the arbitrary a1,2 the maximal discrimination of pure and mixed S states gives\nthe expectation value of observable:\nSa = Sx cos \u03b3 + Sy sin \u03b3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is \u03c8s quantum phase between |s1,2 i components. The value of rp = 2|S\u0304a |,\nwhich lays between 0 and 1, can be chosen as S purity rate. These estimates indicate\nthat even the incoming pure and mixed S states with the same S\u0304z differ, in fact,\nonly statistically with the minimal overlap 50%, but not on 'event by event' basis.\nLet's consider the final state \u03a8S,D of (3) and corresponding mixed ensemble induced\nby gemenge W s with the same S\u0304z . For all conjugated D observables Q, Qx , Qy their\noverlap between pure and mixed states K(Q), K(Qx,y ) is equal to 1, the same is true\nfor Q, Qx,y linear forms. Hence even statistically no information about S state purity\nis transferred to D via MS information channel, which is tuned to the optimal Sz\nvalue measurement. S\u0304z value is transferred to D as Q\u0304, whereas for Sa and other\n7\n\n\fSx,y linear forms their expectation values aren't transferred to D, these constraints\nare induced by Heisenberg commutation relations. Below the similar information\nconstraints will be considered for the individual S, D states also.\n\n3\n\nMeasurements and Information Acquisition\n\n3.1\n\nSystem Self-Description and Measurements\n\nNow the information system (IGUS) O will be consistently treated as the quantum\nobject, therefore in this setting our aim is to find the relation between MS state and\nthe information acquired by O during the measurement. As was noticed above, in the\ninformation-theoretical framework S, D, O system can be described as the informational channel. However, the standard calculations of information transfer via quantum channels describe only its statistical characteristics [11, 12], the novel features,\nwhich appear in the analysis of individual states, weren't studied. In information theory the most general and mathematically powerful approach to the measurements is\nintroduced by the formalism of system self-description [8]. To illustrate its meaning,\nlet's consider some information system O, which measures the parameters of arbitrary object \u03a9. Plainly, O can be considered formally as the subsystem of 'global'\nsystem \u039e = {\u03a9,O} with the state set NT , so that NO \u2286 NT where NO is the set of O\nstates. When \u03a9, O interaction is finished, \u039e will be in some final state \u0393, which for\nthe effective measuring set-up is correlated with the initial \u03a9 state \u03c6in . Therefore,\nthe measurement of \u03a9 state by O in this approach is equivalent to \u0393 measurement\nby \u039e subsystem O. In this approach it can be described as the mapping of \u039e set NT\nto its subset NO , i.e. to itself, so such process can be called \u039e measurement from\ninside [6]. The restrictive map MO \u0393 \u2192 RO describes the restriction of \u039e state to O,\nby the slight abuse of definitions, RO called also O restricted state. In practice, the\ninformation acquisition by O always correlates with the change of its internal state,\ncorrespondingly, in our approach RO should be correlated with \u0393. For example, if\nO is the atom, RO can be the state of its electronic shells, their excitations would\n'record' the incoming signals.\nSuch complicated formalism is useful when the final \u039e state isn't factorizable,\ni.e. \u0393 6= \u03c6f \u2297 RO where \u03c6f is the final \u03a9 state; this is just the case for quantum\nmeasurements. For the start our formalism is supposed to be minimal in a sense that\nO can discriminate as the different entities all restricted O individual states if for\n\u2032\nholds. If it fails, the formalism can be corrected so that\nthem the relation RO 6= RO\n\u2032\nRO would denote the corresponding equivalence classes. In the simplest case RO , RO\ndistinguishability by O assumes that at least for one of O internal parameters LO\n\u2032\n(or LO expectation values\nits values 0/1 can be put in correspondence to RO , RO\nfor statistical states) [8]. The important property of \u039e restrictions is formulated by\n\u2032\nBreuer Theorem: if for two arbitrary \u039e states \u0393, \u0393\u2032 their restrictions RO , RO\ncoincide,\nthen for O this \u039e states are indistinguishable [5]. It seems that for any nontrivial\n\u039e, O at least one pair of such \u039e states exists. For classical systems the incompleteness\nof \u039e description by O has the obvious reason: O is only the part of \u039e, but it should\n8\n\n\fdescribe its own state RO plus the state of \u039e 'residual', hence NT mapping to NO\ncan't be unambiguous [6]. The map MO\u2212 , which put in correspondence to RO some \u039e\nstate \u0393 which restriction to O is equal to RO , i.e. MO\u2212 RO \u2192 \u0393, is called the inference\nmap; as follows from Breuer theorem such mapping can be ambiguous.\nConstructing the quantum self-description formalism, we shall exploit standard\nQM axiomatic if no direct contradiction to it will appear. Namely, it will be supposed\nthat linear QM formalism is correct relative to quantum O considered as RF, in\nparticular, the corresponding observables are linear, self-adjoint operators. In general,\nMO derivation for arbitrary quantum \u039e is the difficult problem which, probably, can\nbe solved only by use of C \u2217 -algebra formalism. Therefore, it's instructive to start\nits consideration here from simple MS model with the hope to find the solution for\nthis particular case. It turns out that it doesn't demand to exploit the complete\nself-description formalism, but only its most obvious features.\n\n3.2\n\nQuantum O model\n\nIn our approach MS as the whole is considered as the quantum object, which is\ndescribed by the quantum state \u03c1M S (t) relative to some external RF O \u2032 . S, D are\ntaken to be the same as in the previous section, with the same state \u03a8S,D of (3)\ninteracting with IGUS O. We shall suppose that in our MS model O states are also\ndefined on two-dimensional Hilbert space HO and O initial state:\n1\n|O0 i = \u221a (|O1i + |O2 i)\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere |O1,2 i are eigenstates of O 'internal pointer' observable V with eigenvalues v1,2 .\nD, O interaction starts at some t2 > t1 and finishes at t3 = t2 + \u03c4 where \u03c4 is the same\nas for HS,D , during this time interval the information about D state is transferred\nto O. D, O interaction is also described by Zurek hamiltonian HD,O with the same\nparameters as HS,D . Under this conditions the interaction of \u03a8S,D , |O0i states will\nresult in:\n\u03a8M S =\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\nai |si i|Di i|Oi i\n\n(9)\n\nrelative to external O \u2032. Such triple decomposition is unique and in this sense defines\n|O1,2 i as the preferred basis (PB) of O states. Such PB has only formal meaning and\ndoesn't suppose any physical preferencies, so it differs principally from dynamical PB\nof decoherence theory [22]. In principle, O can include other DFs which participate\nin information processing, yet we shall suppose that during D, O interaction they\ndon't interact with O DFs described by HO .\n\n3.3\n\nRestrictions of MS quantum states\n\nWe shall start our study from the restrictions of \u039e statistical states \u0393st , because their\nderivation is more simple. Since RO is O internal state, let's suppose for the start\nthat it defined on HO only, below this assumption will be reconsidered. It's also\n9\n\n\fplausible to admit that the expectation values of all O observables should be the\nsame both for given \u0393st and its O restriction Rst . Then, from QM correspondence\nbetween this set of expectation values and the statistical states of given system it\nfollows that the only consistent solution for Rst is the partial trace of \u039e state over \u03a9\nDFs, i.e. is O reduced state. For our MS model \u03a9 formally corresponds not to S,\nbut to S, D subsystem, hence the statistical restriction corresponding to MS state of\n(9) is equal to:\nX\nRst = T r\u03a9 \u03c1M S =\n|ai |2 |Oi ihOi |\n(10)\nwhere \u03c1M S = |\u03a8M S ih\u03a8M S |. Let's start the study of individual \u039e restrictions from\nthe situations when \u039e final state is the tensor product of \u03a9, O states. For our MS\nmodel they appear in the measurements of Sz eigenstates |si i. In this case, the final\nMS state is equal to:\n\u03a8i = |si i \u2297 |Di i \u2297 |Oi i\n(11)\nPlainly, due to the factorization of S, D and O states defined on their own Hilbert\nspaces \u03a8i restriction \u03bei = |Oi i. The same conclusion follows from (10), because\nfor the pure ensembles the statistical and individual states are equivalent. For this\nMS restrictions \u03bei their V eigenvalues vi are O real (objective) properties [1], so the\ndifference between the restricted states \u03bei is also objective. Therefore, it's reasonable\nto admit that in such measurement from inside O can identify them as the different\nstates characterized by IP JiO = vi . Due to such unambiguous correspondence with\nparticular IPs, |O1,2 i constitute the 'information' basis, the comparison with it will\nhelp to derive the measurement outcomes for other S states.\nConsider now the individual measurements of S mixed ensemble W s described\nin the sect. 2. By preparation, this is probabilistic mixture of |s1,2 i states, for each\nof them S, D and D, O interactions results in appearance of orthogonal MS states\n\u03a8i of (11). Thus, such MS ensemble is described by the gemenge W M S = {\u03a8i , Pi }.\nThe corresponding individual MS state is stochastic, i.e. it can change from event to\nevent:\n\u03a5M S = \u03a81 \u222a \u03a82\n(12)\nwhere the frequencies of \u03a81,2 appearance are described by the same probabilities P1,2 .\nThe restriction to O of \u03a81,2 were obtained above, so O restriction of this stochastic\nMS state is equal to:\nRmix = \u03be1 \u222a \u03be2\n(13)\nEach \u03bei appears with the corresponding probability Pi , so that the resulting ensemble\nof O restricted states is described by the gemenge W O = {\u03bei , Pi }.\nFor nonfactorized individual \u039e states Breuer assumed phenomenologically that,\nanalogously to the statistical states, their restrictions are equal to O reduced states\n[6]. For our MS and \u03a8M S of (9) it gives:\nRB = T r\u03a9 \u03c1M S =\n\nX\n\n|ai |2 |Oi ihOi |\n\n(14)\n\nPlainly, this ansatz excludes beforehand any kind of stochastic behavior for MS restriction. The resulting RB differs from Rmix of (13) which describes the restriction\n10\n\n\fof corresponding mixed MS ensemble W M S . It follows that, in principle, O can discriminate the individual pure/mixed MS states 'from inside', because the condition\nof Breuer theorem is violated. Yet it will be argued below that the informationtheoretical analysis of individual measurements permits to derive the MS restrictions\nto O unambiguously without any ad hoc assumptions, and the obtained results will\ndisagree with the former conclusion. Note also that even for this simple ansatz the\ninference map MO\u2212 is ambiguous: all MS states of (9) with the same |a1,2 | has the\nsame restriction RB of (14), so it's not possible, in principle, to choose just one of\nthem from the knowledge of RB only.\n\n3.4\n\nDiscrimination of Restricted States\n\nAs was shown, the measurement of Sz eigenstates |s1,2 i produces final MS states \u03a81,2 ,\nwhich O restrictions \u03be1,2 are equal to |O1,2 i. Let's compare with this 'information'\nbasis the measurement of |s1,2 i superposition of (1). In this case MS final state of (9)\n\u03a8M S 6= \u03a81,2 of (11), but by itself, the formal difference of two MS individual states is\nthe necessary but not sufficient condition for their discrimination by O. In addition,\nthere should exist the particular MS measurement from inside which would permit\nO to detect the difference between the restrictions of this MS states to O. In our\nO\nformalism \u03be1,2 are identified by O as IP J1,2\n, i.e. as some set of real parameters {el } in\neach event. Previously, JiO was expressed as e1 = vi , in principle, it can include also\nother parameters e2 , ..., em , which values are identical for \u03be1,2 . According to Boolean\nlogic, if for O MS restriction RO differs from \u03be1,2 , then RO can be identified by O in\nO\nthe event of measurement as the different set of real parameters, i.e. as IP JRO 6= J1,2\n.\nO\nTherefore, JRO , J1,2\nshould include at least one parameter ej , which value g0 for RO is\ndifferent from its values g1,2 for \u03be1,2 . In QM framework such ej should be some MS\nobservable G to which corresponds the linear, self-adjoint operator \u011c. In this case\nRO , \u03be1,2 will be G eigenstates with the eigenvalues g0,1,2 ; O would discriminate RO\nfrom \u03be1,2 if g0 6= g1,2 . It was supposed earlier that MS restrictions to O are defined\non HO , so it follows that G should belong to the set (algebra) of O observables UO .\nIn our MS model UO is equivalent to observable algebra of spin 21 object, so any O\nnontrivial observable can be expressed as [4]:\nA = d0 V + d1 V x + d2 V y\nwhere arbitrary real di coefficients are normalized as\nare conjugated to Q and obey the standard relations:\n\nP\n\nd2i = 1. O observables V x,y\n\n[V, V x,y ] = 2i\u03b2V y,x\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 for V x commutator, \u22121 for V y one. \u03be1,2 exhaust the spectra of Q\neigenstates and so G 6= V . As easy to check, \u03bei can't be the eigenstate of any other\nG 6= V , hence there is no O observable G which can satisfy to all necessary demands\nsimultaneously.\nThus, only \u03be1,2 states can be unambiguously discriminated by O in such MS\nO\nmeasurement from inside, there is no IP JRO 6= J1,2\nwhich can be correctly ascribed\n11\n\n\fto RO . Since any alternative outcomes for MS measurement by O are supposedly\nimpossible in our formalism, in particular, 'undefined outcome', the only consistent\nansatz for JRO is equal to:\nJRO = v1 \u222a v2\nAs the result, O can't distinguish RO and \u03bei states and O restriction of \u03a8M S of (9)\nis equivalent to:\nRO = \u03be1 \u222a \u03be2\n(15)\ni.e. it coincides with Rmix of (13). It means that MS restrictive map MO is stochastic,\nand because of it, the corresponding inference map MO\u2212 is ambiguous. Only O observables corresponding to the nonlinear operators can reveal the difference between\n\u03a8M S and \u03a81,2 restrictions to O, but their measurability contradicts to standard QM\naxiomatic. From the properties of O statistical restrictions Rst which describe RO\nensembles, it's reasonable to assume that O should observe the collapse of pure S\nstate to one of vi at random with probability Pi = |ai |2 . Really, the statistical O\nstate Rst should give the correct expectation value V\u0304 for large ensemble of events.\nHowever, the assumption that the probabilities of vi outcomes follow Born rule\nisn't self-obvious, it should be verified in any new theory of measurement [1, 19].\nLeaving for the future the detailed proof, here we notice that for our MS, which\nconsists of spin 21 objects only, such relations can be derived from QM invariance\nrelative to the space reflections and rotations. For example, as easy to check, for\na1 = a2 ei\u03b3 , the equality P1 = P2 for arbitrary \u03b3 follows directly from QM reflection\ninvariance. In this case the quantum phase \u03b3 defines S spin orientation ~n, which is\nconfined in X, Y plane. Hence if P1 6= P2 for some \u03b3, it will mean the violation of\nQM reflection invariance relative to this plane.\nIn this calculations it was supposed that O restrictions of MS states can be discriminated by O observables only which seems quite reasonable. However, such assumption can be proved only in C \u2217 algebra formalism. Hence in linear QM formalism\none should check MS observable algebra in search of observables which can discriminate the pure and mixed MS ensembles described above. Basing on the properties\nof statistical restrictions considered in sect. 3, we suppose that if the restriction RO\nof some MS state \u03a8a is the eigenstate of some observable \u039ba , then \u03a8a is also \u039ba\neigenstate. In this framework MS states can be used in search of suitable observable\nG, so that for it the following relations should be fulfilled simultaneously:\n\u011c\u03a8M S = g0 \u03a8M S\n\u011c\u03a81,2 = g1,2 \u03a81,2\n\n(16)\nP\n\nand g0 6= g1,2 . However, analogously to sect. 2, \u03a8M S = ai \u03a8i , and the substitution\nof second equation into the first one gives: g0 = g1 = g2 . Hence no MS observable G\npossesses the different eigenvalues for \u03a8M S of (9) and \u03a81,2 of (11), so even if all MS\nobservables would be available for O measurement from inside, it will not permit O\nto discriminate such MS states. Since these calculations are applicable to arbitrary\nMS observable, the same conclusion should be true also for the measurements of MS\nobservables by external O \u2032 which will be considered below.\n12\n\n\fIt's well known that the decoherence of pure states by its environment E is the\nimportant effect in quantum measurements [15], so it's instructive to consider its\npossible influence on our results. In the simplified version of decoherence dynamics it\nsupposed that MS, E start to interact only at the final stage of S measurement. Hence\nif D, O start to interact with E at t > t3 , for the typical decoherence hamiltonian it\nfollows that \u03a8M S of (9) will evolve into MS, E final state:\n\u03a8M S,E =\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\na|si i|Di i|Oi i\n\nN\nE\nY\nj\n\n|Eij i\n\n(17)\n\nwhere E j are E elements, NE is their total number. If an arbitrary O pure state\n\u03a8O is prepared, it will also decohere in a very short time into the analogous |Oi i\ncombinations entangled with E. Thus, of all pure O states, only |Oi i states are\nstable relative to E decoherence. Therefore it supports their choice as O information\nPB, since in such environment O simply can't percept and memorize any other O pure\nstate during any sizable time interval. Yet by itself it doesn't result into MS state\ncollapse, because |Oi i superpositions are conserved. Therefore, this considerations\ndon't change principally our previous results, the only novel feature is that now the\nrestrictions of MS, E joint state to O should be studied.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nGeneral Properties of Quantum Measurements\nRestrictions and Joint MS Observables\n\nThe presented calculations, in our opinion, demonstrate the principal stochasticity of\nmeasurement outcomes for considered MS model. The considered Sz measurement\nformally corresponds to the information transferred via the channel C1 which scheme\ncan be expressed as :\nS\u2192D\u2192O\n\nhere for the simplicity the decoherence is neglected. In this section we shall discuss\nsome features of quantum measurements, which can be important for our formalism.\nWe shall consider first the question whether the difference between the pure and\nmixed final MS states can be detected by external O \u2032 . It's argued often that if it\ncan be shown that MS state is pure, then it excludes the possibility of stochastic\noutcomes for O in any theory [2]. As was shown above, this is, in fact, untrue for\nMS measurement from inside, yet such reasoning results in frequent confusions, so\nit's instructive to consider it here.\nFor MS the difference between the pure and mixed ensembles with the same S\u0304z\ncan be revealed by interference terms (IT), which are the joint S, D, O observables\n[1]; the similar observables for S state superposition were considered in sect. 2. Their\ntypical ansatz can be written as:\nB(c) = c1 |O1 ihO2|D1 ihD2 ||s1 ihs2 | + c2 |O2 ihO1|D2 ihD1 ||s2 ihs1 |\n\n(18)\n\nwhere c1 = c\u22172 and |ci | = 1. B can't be measured by O 'from inside', at least for the\ndescribed set-up, which tuned to the optimal Sz measurement. Being measured by\n13\n\n\fexternal O \u2032 via its interaction with S, D, O, for all ci it gives B\u0304 = 0 for arbitrary\n\u03a81,2 probabilistic mixture, but for any MS state \u03a8M S of (9) there are some ci values\nfor which B\u0304 6= 0. We shall start their study from symmetric B with c1,2 = 1, then\nfor symmetric S state \u03c8s of (1) with a1,2 = \u221a12 , the resulting \u03a8M S is B eigenstate\nwith eigenvalue b1 = 1; B possesses also other eigenvalues, but only b2 = \u22121 is\nimportant for our case. For the comparison the probability PB (b1,2 ) = .5 for W M S\nmixture with S\u0304z = 0, the intersection of its b distribution with the one for \u03a8M S\nresults in their overlap K(B) = .5 of (6). Hence the pure/mixed MS states with\nthe same S\u0304z can be discriminated even by external O \u2032 only statistically, because the\ncorresponding distributions of B values (or other ITs) essentially overlap. From the\ncomparison with the results of previous section it follows that the information about\nS state purity, which in this case is characterized by the rate rp = 2|S\u0304x |, is mapped\nto the expectation value of joint MS observable B, but not of any O observable. The\nproperties of ITs for other ci values and different \u03a8M S are similar to the symmetric\none, so we shall not describe them here. In particular, being measured by O \u2032 for such\nci range it gives the minimal overlap:\nK(B) = 1 \u2212 |a1 ||a2 |\nbetween the pure and mixed ensembles with the same S\u0304z . B(c) measurement or\nany other measurement of MS state purity corresponds formally to the information\ntransfer via the channel C2 which scheme can be expressed as:\nS \u2192 (S, D) \u2192 (S, D, O) \u2192 O \u2032\nit differs principally from C1 structure, which describes the information transfer in S\nto O. Plainly, the similar ITs for S, D subsystem are equal to:\nB S,D = c1 |D1 ihD2 ||s1 ihs2 | + c2 |D2 ihD1 ||s2 ihs1 |\n\n(19)\n\nwith the same ci range, as above. In principle, they can be measured by O via the\nsimultaneous interaction with S and D, but it would mean the principal modification\nof MS set-up and corresponding hamiltonians, which tuned to the optimal measurement of Sz . Other properties of S, D ITs are analogous to considered MS ITs, so\nwe shall not describe them here. The account of D, O decoherence by E makes the\ncorresponding ITs quite complicated, but their studies show that, in principle, the\nmain conclusions about their role in the measurements don't change [1, 2].\nThe proposed theory admits that in general the same MS state can be stochastic\nfor O measuring it from inside, but in the same time can evolve linearly relative to\nsome external O \u2032 RF. However, such situation by itself doesn't lead to any experimentally observed inconsistency for the results of measurements which can be performed\nby O and O \u2032 . Really, for the symmetric \u03c8s state prepared by O \u2032 it follows that O\ncan perform Sz measurement with some outcome s\u0303, whereas O \u2032 can infer that MS\nis in the quantum pure state with B eigenvalue b1 = 1. It means that O \u2032 can be\naware that O has obtained in Sz measurement some definite result, but can't know\nits value s\u0303, i.e. Sz value is still uncertain for O \u2032. This conclusion looks reasonable,\n14\n\n\fbecause in this set-up O \u2032 doesn't interact with MS at all, and so there is no possibility\nto transfer any information about MS state to O \u2032 , so that O \u2032 can use only this one,\nwhich it (he) has possessed before Sz measurement was started. In this case Sz value\nin given event will be subjective for O, until O \u2032 would measure it separately, then O \u2032\nwill percept the same s\u0303 value as O. Therefore, such formalism is compatible with the\nnonapplicability of ignorance interpretation to standard QM [1].\nThe consistent description of this situation can be given by the formalism of unitarily nonequivalent representations developed in Algebraic QM [4]. Here we notice\nonly that O and O \u2032 deal with different sets of available MS observables, so the transformation of states between O and O \u2032 , in principle, is nonunitary. Note that earlier\nC \u2217 algebras were applied to the description of quantum measurements in the infinite\nsystems [1], however, the practical measurement devices are finite and it seems that\nfor the measurement process their finiteness is quite essential feature.\n\n4.2\n\nInformation Transfer in Hierarchic Measurements\n\nIn our approach to self-description we exploited Boolean structure of S signal recognition by IGUS O; it is fulfilled, in particular, if O IP space or each of its components\nei is the ordered set. Such structure reflects, in fact, the essence of any measurement\nprocedure: as its result O puts in unambiguous correspondence to the individual\nevent n the array of real numbers J(n). In particular, if there are some well-defined,\nbasic IPs (JiO for our MS model), then for any new event O can infer whether its\noutcome is equal to one of them or differs from all of them. In our MS model quantum\nO can identify |si i as IP JiO = vi , this is the objective difference and such O state for\nexternal O \u2032 is described by |Oi i. The considered dichotomic Boolean template for O\nrecognition of Sz eigenstates is induced by O quantum dynamics described by HD,O ,\nit is similar to the state of yes/no logical unit of macroscopic information system. If\nO recognition is universally Boolean, then an arbitrary entangled MS state \u03a8M S of\n(9) should induce IP JRO , which either can be equal to one of JiO or to differ from both\nof them. Boolean structure of recognition is rather obvious for the signal recognition\nin macroscopic information systems [8]; our studies demonstrate that QM observable\nalgebra induces such structure for simple model of quantum IGUS O.\nNow we shall explore whether the results for Sz measurement by O can be derived\nfrom this premises avoiding the direct use of self-description formalism or, at least,\nits most sophisticated part. For that purpose let us reconsider the arguments of sect.\n2 in more detailed way, which is provided by our previous calculations. Remind that\nin our MS model after some time moment t1 S and D stop to interact, whereas D\nand O start to interact at t2 > t1 , so that even for arbitrary HD,O interaction O can\nmeasure directly only D observables. Really, at t > t2 the object S can be miles away\nfrom D and O, in this case S and S, D observables surely will be unavailable for O\ndirectly. Thus, for our HD,O interaction tuned to optimal Q measurement, we can\nformally regard MS as the information channel C1 described above, it transfers first\nS signal to D, and after that D signal to O. In our MS model the measurement of Sz\neigenstates |si i induces factorized MS state \u03a8i of (11); in this case O interacts with\nO\nD separate state \u2206D = |D1,2 i and, as was shown, O percepts it as IPs J1,2\n= v1,2 .\n15\n\n\fLet's consider Sz measurement for the incoming |si i probabilistic mixture (gemenge)\nW s with some S\u0304z . When S, D interaction is finished at t1 , it becomes the mixture\n(gemenge) of \u03a81,2\nC of (2) with Q\u0304 = S\u0304z . As was shown above, at t > t3 when D\nmeasurement by O is finished, its result will be percepted by O as J1O or J2O with the\nprobabilities P1,2 defined by S\u0304z . In the same vein, consider the possible outcome for\npure S state \u03c8s of (1) with the same S\u0304z . In this framework at the final stage of Sz\nmeasurement, D separate state \u2206D interacts with O, which results in appearance of\nO\nsome O IP JsO , which can either coincide with one of the basic O IPs J1,2\nor differ\n1,2\nfrom them. As was shown in sect. 2, \u03a8S,D of (3) and \u03a8C can't be the nondegenerate\neigenstates of some D observable G. Thus, even if O can measure all D observables\nsimultaneously, it wouldn't permit O to detect the difference between such pure and\nmixed S ensembles; so for such pure ensemble O would percept in the individual\nevents IP:\nJsO = J1O .or.J2O\nwith probabilities P1,2 correspondingly. Really the opposite result, i.e the observation\nby O of such difference would mean that O can measure D observable which corresponds to the nonlinear operator, but this is beyond the realm of standard QM. It\nevidences that in this set-up D state doesn't contain the information about S purity\nand so it principally can't be dispatched to O. This conclusion doesn't change even\nif suppose that O can somehoq measure the joint S, D observables in this set-up.\nIf the information about S purity isn't transferred by D, then O performance by\nitself doesn't play any role in the appearance of the outcome stochasticity for u, d\nsuperposition. The only feature which O should possess is the proper discrimination\nO\nof |D1,2 i states as J1,2\n. The obtained results don't mean that in the pure case the\nseparate D state \u2206D is the objective probabilistic mixture of |D1,2 i, rather \u2206D can\nbe characterized as their 'weak' superposition stipulated by the entanglement of S,\ne\nD states. In this framework RD\nof (4) can be regarded as the symbolic expression\nof this difference. Yet the complete description of D properties is performed only\nby S, D state as the whole, so that some of them are described by the nonlocal\nS, D observables. No measurement performed on D only can reveal the difference of\n\u03a8S,D from the corresponding \u03a8iC mixture. Only the measurement of some joint S, D\nobservables, like B S,D , can reveal it, but also only statistically [1].\nIn this framework we consider also the information content of individual S states\nat the input of C1 channel. Plainly, Sz eigenstates |si i transfer 1 bit of information in\nSz measurement; correspondingly, the overlap (6) of such states K(Sz ) = 0. Consider\nnow the information about S state purity characterized by the purity rate rp for the\nsymmetric |si i superposition \u03c8s with a1,2 = \u221a12 . As was shown in sect. 2, the\nminimal overlap with the corresponding u, d mixture W s is dispatched by Sx and\ngives K(Sx ) = .5. Hence one can tell metaphorically that S state purity is described\nonly by 'half-bit' of information at the channel input. Yet even this incoming 'half-bit'\nisn't transferred to D, because, as was shown in sect. 2, for any D observable there is\nthe complete overlap between the resulting pure and mixed D states. This example\ndemonstrates that S individual state, in principle, doesn't contain the information\nabout its purity on 'event by event' basis, because the operational difference between\n16\n\n\fthe considered pure and mixed S states is too small for that. Such information\nis contained only in S statistical state, which describes the properties of large S\nensemble, but even it can't transfer such information to O via MS channel. For\nindividual states the difference between such pure and mixed S states can be described\nonly by the observables related to the nonlinear operators.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nAny consistent physical theory should not contain the logical contradictions, in particular, it should be true for its predictions of measurement results. In his notorious\npaper devoted to the role of information and observers in quantum measurements\nWigner has claimed: 'The simultaneous observation of two opposite outcomes of\nquantum experiments is nonsense' [18]. However, this statement wasn't consistently\nproved and is, probably, erroneous for the measurement of quantum objects. Meanwhile, as follows from our analysis, the structure of QM Observable algebra, which\nincludes only the self-adjoint operators, by itself excludes such controversial outcomes. It follows that for simple models this structure corresponds to Boolean logics\nof signals recognition. It demonstrates that the independent axiom of reduction is\nunnecessary in QM; all the measurement features supposedly can be deduced from\nQM axiom, which settles QM observables to be the linear, self-adjoint operators.\nNote also that the absence of quantum observables described by nonlinear operators\nfinds its explanation in fuzzy methods of quantization [20].\nIn this approach the stochasticity in quantum measurements is related to the\nincompleteness and undecidability aspects of information theory, which studies was\ninitiated be notorious theorem by G\u00f6del [8]. Our approach concerns also with the\nself-reference of information theory, its consistency for the case of quantum measurements was shown in [5]. The described measurement mechanism can be called the\nsubjective collapse, because MS as the whole is in the pure state throughout the measurement relative to some external observer O \u2032 . The studies of relativistic formalism\nof quantum measurements support the subjective character of state collapse, only in\nthis case its consistent covariant description can be formulated [21]. In addition, the\nformalism of system self-description permits to resolve the old problem of Heisenberg\ncut in quantum measurements by the inclusion of the information system into our\nformalism properly and on equal terms with other MS elements. The similar ideas\nabout the measurement process and its relation to the information acquisition were\nproposed in Existential interpretation of QM by Zurek [22]. Also the analogous subjective approach to the measurement problem, but in phenomenological form, was\nproposed in so-called Relational QM, yet it demands the modification of standard\nQM formalism [23].\nThis considerations are closely related to the question whether this theory is\napplicable to the observations made by human observer O, in particular, whether in\nthis case IP J O describes the true O 'impressions' about their outcomes ? This is\nopen problem, but at the microscopic level the human brain should obey QM laws as\nany other object, so we don't see any serious reasons to make the exceptions. In our\n17\n\n\fmodel the detection of eigenstate |Di i by O can be associated with the excitation of\nsome O internal levels. This process is supposedly similar to the excitation of brain\nmolecules during the acquisition of external signal. Note also that in our theory the\nbrain or any other processor O plays only the passive role of signal receiver. As was\nargued the real effect of information loss essential for collapse occurs 'on the way'\nwhen the quantum signal passes through the information channel.\nWe conclude that standard Schr\u00f6dinger QM formalism together with the informationtheoretical considerations permit to derive the 'subjective' collapse of pure states\nwithout implementation of independent Reduction axiom into QM axiomatic. In our\napproach the source of stochasticity is the principal constraint on the transfer of specific information in S \u2192 O information channel. This information characterizes the\npurity of S state, because of its loss, O can't discriminate the pure and mixed S states.\nAs the result of this information incompleteness, the stochasticity of measurement\noutcomes appear.\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
