Although various implementations of this general measurement procedure have been realized, the aim is always that of\nestimating the relative phase of the two \"arms\" of the interferometer and great efforts have\nbeen pursued to enhance the sensitivity of this phase determination [1, 2].\nThe accuracy of the whole estimation procedure [3]-[6] depends on the number of resources\nat disposal, i.e. on the total number N of particles involved in the interferometric measure.\nIt turns out that the minimum uncertainty in the phase estimation that can be achieved by\nfeeding the interferometer with \"classical\" states can not exceed the\n\u221a shot noise limit, also\ncalled the standard quantum limit, where the precision scales as 1/ N.\nVarious strategies have been devised in order to beat this limit, typically adopting nonstandard measurement protocols that make use of quantum correlated (entangled), nonclassical states.1 In this way, at least in line of principle, the so called Heisenberg limit in\n1\n\nThe literature on the subject is vast, dealing both with optical as well as atom interferometers; for a\npartial list, see [7]-[33] and references therein.\n\n1\n\n\faccuracy\u221acan be reached, where the uncertainty in the phase estimation scales as 1/N rather\nthan 1/ N .\nA particularly promising implementation of an interferometer that could reach such a high\nsensitivity is that of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [34]-[37] trapped in a double-well\noptical potential. Although similar to more traditional constructions that use beams of\nparticles travelling along separate paths, this new realization of the interferometry paradigm\nallows a precise control on the preparation and dynamics of the system.\nThe clear advantage in using BEC-based interferometers is that all particles in the apparatus, being in a condensed phase, share the same quantum state; this fact, together with\nthe possibility of preparing them in a suitably entangled state, have been shown to lead to\nthe possibility of phase estimation with sub-shot-noise accuracy [22]-[32]. However, these\nparticles, being spatially confined bosons, behave as identical particles, a fact that seems to\nhave not been properly taken into account in the derivation of the above mentioned results.\nPurpose of the present investigation is to study the effects of particle indistinguishability\nin relation to the metrological use of BEC-based interferometers for phase estimation. Since\nentanglement appears to be a fundamental resource in reaching sub-shot-noise accuracies, one\nfirst needs to generalize this notion to states describing identical particles. This is presented\nin Section 2; there, we shall see that one needs to abandon the usual definition of separability\nexpressed in terms of tensor product of one-particle Hilbert spaces, in favor of a more general\ndefinition based on the choice of commuting algebras of observables. In Section 3 we shall\nexplicitly discuss how this generalized notion of entanglement, based on a dual description in\nterms of operators rather than states, works in the case of a BEC confined in a double-well\ntrap. Finally, in the light of this discussion, in Section 4 we shall critically re-examine the\ntheoretical results concerning the use of the notion of quantum Fisher information in getting\nsub-shot-noise accuracies in quantum metrological phase estimation. The final Section 5\ncontains further discussions and remarks.\n\n2\n\nIdentical particles entanglement\n\nThe usual notion of entanglement for states of a system of N distinguishable particles makes\nuse of the natural tensor product structure of the N-body system. The total Hilbert space\nH of the system can in fact be decomposed as H = H1 \u2297 H2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 HN in terms of the\nvarious single-particle Hilbert spaces Hi , i = 1, 2 . . . , N. Then a state for the N-body system,\nrepresented by a density matrix \u03c1 acting on H, is said to be separable if it can be written\nas a convex combination of single-particle states,\nX\nX\n(1)\n(2)\n(N )\n\u03c1=\npk \u03c1k \u2297 \u03c1k \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c1k ,\npk \u2265 0 ,\npk = 1 ,\n(1)\nk\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03c1(i) represents a density matrix for the i-th particle; otherwise, the state \u03c1 for the N\ndistinguishable particles is said to be entangled.\n2\n\n\fThe tensor product structure used in (1) reflects on one hand the natural multi-partition\nof the system into its N parts, and on the other the possibility of identifying linear local\noperations on the system, i. e. maps of the form2\n\u039b = \u039b(1) \u2297 \u039b(2) \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u039b(N ) ,\n(2)\n\u0002 \u0003\nwhere the linear map \u039b(i) : \u03c1(i) 7\u2192 \u039b(i) \u03c1(i) affects only the i-th particle density matrix.\nComing now to the case of a system of N identical particles, one easily realizes that states\nof the form (1) are not allowed quantum states for the system. Indeed, if one could assign a\ndensity matrix \u03c1(1) to the first particle, \u03c1(2) to the second one and so on, we would have a\nway to distinguish them by means of their identifying states.\nOn the other hand, recalling the standard rules of quantum mechanics, a pure state |\u03c8i of\nN identical particles must be a symmetric or antisymmetric combination of tensor products\nof N-single particle vector states, while a mixed state, i.e. a density matrix, must be a\nlinear convex combination of projections |\u03c8ih\u03c8| onto such symmetrized or antisymmetrized\nvectors [41, 42].3\nIn particular, this result excludes the possibility of curing the intrinsic distinguishability of\nthe particles when described by states as in (1), by symmetrizing or antisymmetrizing them:\nindeed, in the end, this would always be a mixture of states where particles can be effectively\ndistinguished. In other words, density matrices describing identical particles must be made\nof projections onto pure states of the appropriate (symmetrized or antisymmetrized) Hilbert\nspace. As a consequence, not even the so-called \"symmetric states\" of the form\nX\n\u03c1=\npk \u03c1k \u2297 \u03c1k \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c1k ,\n(3)\nk\n\nwhere, unlike in (1), all particles in each term of the convex combination are described by the\nsame one-particle density matrix, are in general admissible states for a system of identical\nparticles.\nThe example of a system of two qubits can further clarify these points. The Hilbert space\nof two distinguishable qubits is C2 \u2297 C2 \u2261 C4 , and therefore four-dimensional. Instead, the\nHilbert space for two identical qubits is a symmetric three-dimensional subspace of C4 in\nthe case of bosons, or an antisymmetric one-dimensional subspace for fermions. Given an\northonormal basis in C4 , |+, +i, |+, \u2212i, |\u2212, +i, |\u2212, \u2212i, where + and \u2212 indicates the two\nsingle-qubit levels,\u221athe symmetric sector is spanned by |+, +i, |+, +i, and the combination\n\u221a\n(|+, \u2212i + |\u2212, +i)/ 2, while the antisymmetric one is generated by (|+, \u2212i \u2212 |\u2212, +i)/ 2. It\nP\n(1)\n(2)\nis now easy to realize that density matrices of the type (1), \u03c1 = k pk \u03c1k \u2297 \u03c1k , can not\n(i)\ndescribe states of two identical qubits. Indeed, a qubit state \u03c1k is represented by a 2 \u00d7 2\n2\n\nIn order to be physically meaningful, these linear transformations must be realized by trace-preserving,\ncompletely positive maps [38, 39]; only in this case, normalization, Tr[\u03c1] = 1, and positivity, \u03c1 \u2265 0, of the\nstates \u03c1 of the N -body system are assured in any situation (for a discussion, see [40]).\n3\nSimilarly, also the observables must be symmetric or antisymmetric under the permutation of all particles;\nin particular, collective, N -body operators are surely admissible observables (see also the note on page 9).\n\n3\n\n\f(1)\n\n(2)\n\ndensity matrix, so that any element \u03c1k \u2297 \u03c1k in the previous convex sum is a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix,\nas is the resulting combination \u03c1. As such, it can not be written in general as a convex\ncombination of solely projections onto symmetric states or in terms of the projection onto\nthe antisymmetric one, as it would be instead required for density matrices describing two\nidentical\nqubits. Clearly, the same conclusion applies also for two qubit states of the form\nP\nk pk \u03c1k \u2297 \u03c1k .\nGiven that the notion of separability based on the decomposition (1) is no longer applicable in the case of a system of identical particles, one is forced to generalize it. This problem\nhas already been addressed and discussed in the literature, although in different physical\ncontexts, e.g. see [43]-[56]. The way out seems to reside in a \"dual\" point of view, where\nemphasis is given to the algebra of observables, instead of the set of states; the connection\nbetween these two \"points of view\" is given by the expectation value map that allows to\nexpress the average of an observable O as its trace with the corresponding density matrix,\nhOi = Tr[\u03c1 O]. We shall first give an abstract definition of this generalized notion of separability and then, in the next Section, apply it to the specific case of condensed bosons trapped\nin a double-well potential.\nLet us consider a system of particles whose pure states span the Hilbert space H and\ndenote by B(H) the algebra of all bounded operators on it; the observables of the system\nclearly belong to this algebra. We shall introduce the notion of (bipartite) separability by\nconsidering couple of commuting subalgebras of B(H) instead of focusing on partitions of\nthe system quantum states. We then introduce the following definitions:\n\u2022 An algebraic bipartition of the algebra B(H) is any pair (A1 , A2 ) of commuting subalgebras of B(H).4\n\u2022 An element (operator) of B(H) is said to be local with respect to the bipartition\n(A1 , A2) if it is the product A1 A2 of an element A1 of A1 and another A2 of A2 .\n\u2022 A state \u03c9 on the algebra B(H) will be called separable with respect to the bipartition\n(A1 , A2) if the expectation \u03c9(A1 A2 ) of any local operator A1 A2 can be decomposed\ninto a linear convex combination of products of expectations:\nX\nX\n(1)\n(2)\n\u03c9(A1 A2 ) =\n\u03bbk \u03c9k (A1 ) \u03c9k (A2 ) ,\n\u03bbk \u2265 0 ,\n\u03bbk = 1 ,\n(4)\nk\n\n(1)\n\nk\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9k and \u03c9k are states on B(H); otherwise the state \u03c9 is said to be entangled\nwith respect the bipartition (A1 , A2).\nAs we shall see in the following, this generalized definition of separability results meaningful\nboth for systems composed of distinguishable particles and for those made of identical ones.\n4\n\nNotice that the two subalgebras A1 and A2 need not reproduce the whole algebra B(H), i.e. in general\nA1 \u222a A2 \u2282 B(H). In this respect, the term \"bipartition\" is not strictly appropriate and has been adopted\nfor sake of simplicity. However, in the case of the system discussed below, the considered mode partitions\nactually generate the whole algebra B(H).\n\n4\n\n\fIn particular, in the case of two finite-level systems, as the two qubits example discussed\nbefore, the above definition reduces to the usual notion of separability. Indeed, it is enough\nto choose the subalgebras A1 and A2 to coincide with the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix algebras of the singlequbits and take as operation of expectation the usual trace operator over the corresponding\ndensity matrix, \u03c9(A1A2 ) = Tr[\u03c1 A1 \u2297 A2 ]; clearly, this expectation can be written as in (4)\nonly if the system state \u03c1 is as in (1) with N = 2. Finally, generalization of the above\ndefinition to the case of more than two partitions is straightforward.\n\n3\n\nIdentical bosons in a double-well trap\n\nWe shall henceforth focus on the study of a system of ultracold bosonic atoms trapped in an\noptical lattice. As mentioned in the Introduction, the high degree of accuracy and sophistication reached in manipulating such systems allow very accurate interferometric measurements,\nmaking them a very attractive set-up for exploring and testing new paradigms in quantum\nmetrology and many-body physics [57, 58].\nThe dynamics of cold atoms confined in an optical trap can be very well approximated by\na Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonian [59, 60]; in the case of a double-well potential, it reads:\nh\ni\nHBH = \u03b51 a\u20201 a1 + \u03b52 a\u20202 a2 + U (a\u20201 a1 )2 + (a\u20202 a2 )2 \u2212 J (a\u20201 a2 + a1 a\u20202 ) ,\n(5)\nwhere a1,2 , a\u20201,2 annihilate and create atom states in the first, second well, respectively, and\nsatisfy the Bose commutation relations [ai , a\u2020j ] = \u03b4ij , i, j = 1, 2. Of the contributions to\nHBH , the last one corresponds to a hopping term depending on the tunneling amplitude J,\nthe first two are due to the trapping potential and are proportional to the depth \u03b51,2 of the\nwells. Finally, the third term, quadratic in the number operators a\u2020i ai , takes into account\nrepulsive Coulomb interactions inside each well.\nWe are using here a formalism of second-quantization, where the creation operator \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x)\nof an atom at position x can be decomposed in general as\n\u2020\n\n\u03c8\u0302 (x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c6\u2217i (x) a\u2020i ,\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nand a\u2020i creates an atom in the state |\u03c6i i = a\u2020i |0i with wavefunction \u03c6i (x) = hx|\u03c6i i; the set\n{|\u03c6i i}\u221e\ni=1 is therefore a complete set of orthonormal single-particle atom states. The BoseHubbard Hamiltonian (5) results from a tight binding approximation, where only the first\ntwo of the basis vector are relevant; in this case \u03c61,2 (x) are orthogonal functions, \u03c61 localized\nwithin the first well, \u03c62 within the second one.\nThe total number N of atoms is conserved by (5). Therefore, the Hilbert space of the\nsystem is N + 1-dimensional and can be spanned by Fock states of the form\n(a\u20201 )k (a\u20202 )N \u2212k\n|k, N \u2212 ki := \u221a p\n|0i ,\nk! (N \u2212 k)!\n5\n\n0\u2264k\u2264N ,\n\n(7)\n\n\fdescribing the situation in which the first well is filled with k atoms, while the other one\ncontains N \u2212 k particles. They are obtained by the action of the creation operators on the\nvacuum. These states turn out to be eigenstates of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian when\nthe tunneling term can be neglected.\nNotice that in this formalism, symmetrization of the elements of the Hilbert space, as\nrequired by the identity of the particles filling the two wells, is automatically guaranteed by\nthe commutativity of the two creation operators [41]. Furthermore, all polynomials in a1 , a\u20201\nand similarly all polynomials in a2 , a\u20202 (together with their respective norm closures), form\ntwo algebras, A1 , respectively A2 , that result commuting: [A1 , A2 ] = 0; they are subalgebras\nof the algebra A of all operators on the Fock space spanned by the states (7).5 According to\nthe definition introduced at the end of the previous Section, they define a bipartition of A\nand therefore can be used to provide the notion of separability for the states describing the\nidentical atoms in the trap, generalizing the one usually adopted for distinguishable particles.\nWith respect to this natural mode bipartition, (A1 , A2 ), the Fock states (7) turn out to be\nseparable states. Indeed, for any polynomial operator A1 (a1 , a\u20201 ) \u2208 A1 and A2 (a2 , a\u20202 ) \u2208 A2 ,\nthe expectation value of the product A1 A2 on such states can always be written as the\nproduct of the separate averages of A1 and of A2 ; explicitly, one has:\n1\nh0|ak1 A1 (a\u20201 )k |0i h0|a2N \u2212k A2 (a\u20202 )N \u2212k |0i\nk!(N \u2212 k)!\n= hk|A1 |ki hN \u2212 k|A2 |N \u2212 ki ,\n(8)\np\n\u221a\nwhere |ki := (a\u20201 )k / k!|0i and |N \u2212ki := (a\u20202 )N \u2212k / (N \u2212 k)!|0i are single-mode Fock states.\nAs a consequence, separable with respect to the bipartition (A1 , A2 ) are also those mixed\nstates that are diagonal with respect to the Fock basis (7), i.e. density matrices of the form:\nhk, N \u2212 k|A1 A2 |k, N \u2212 ki =\n\n\u03c1=\n\nN\nX\nk=0\n\npk |k, N \u2212 kihk, N \u2212 k| ,\n\npk \u2265 0 ,\n\nN\nX\n\npk = 1 .\n\n(9)\n\nk=0\n\nActually, all states separable with respect to the bipartition (A1 , A2 ) must be in diagonal\nform with respect to the Fock basis. An abstract proof of this fact can be easily given. In\nfact, one first observes that the algebra generated by the polynomials in the operators a1 , a\u20201\nand a2 , a\u20202 coincides with the whole algebra of operators A. Then, being pure projections,\nthe states |k, N \u2212kihk, N \u2212k| are the only extremal ones in the convex set of states satisfying\nthe separability condition (4); thus, all others are necessarily a convex combination of them.\nNevertheless, a more direct proof can also be explicitly worked out. A generic density\nmatrix representing a state for a two-mode system of N identical bosons is of the form:\n\u03c1=\n\nN\nX\n\nk,l=0\n\n\u03c1kl |k, N \u2212 kihl, N \u2212 l| ,\n\n5\n\n\u03c1kk \u2265 0 ,\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c1kk = 1 .\n\n(10)\n\nk=0\n\nStrictly speaking, polynomials in bosonic creation and annihilation operators are not bounded, and the\nso-called Weyl algebras of the corresponding exponentials should be used; however, the following discussion\nis not affected by working with algebras of unbounded operators.\n\n6\n\n\fAssume now the state \u03c1 to be separable with respect to the bipartition (A1 , A2 ); this means\nthat for any local operator A1 A2 , with A1 \u2208 A1 and A2 \u2208 A2 , one must have:\nX\n(2)\nTr[\u03c1 A1 A2 ] =\n\u03bbm Tr[\u03c1(1)\n(11)\nm A1 ] Tr[\u03c1m A2 ] ,\nm\n\n(i)\n\nwhere \u03c1m , i = 1, 2, are density matrices of the generic form (10). Choose now A1 = (a\u20201 )m an1 ,\nwith m < n and A2 = (a\u20202 )r as2 , with s < r and m + r = n + s; then, each factor in the sum\nabove identically vanish. Indeed, one finds:\nTr[\u03c1(1)\nm A1 ] =\n\nN\nX\n\nk,l=0\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c1m,kl hk, N \u2212 k|A1 |l, N \u2212 li =\n\nN\nX\nk=0\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c1m,kk hk|A1 |ki \u2261 0 ,\n\n(12)\n\n(2)\n\nand similarly, Tr[\u03c1m A2 ] \u2261 0. However, using (10), one also have:\nTr[\u03c1 A1 A2 ] =\n\nN\nX\n\nk,l=0\n\n\u03c1kl hk|A1 |li hN \u2212 k|A2 |N \u2212 li =\n\nN\n\u2212s\nX\n\n\u03c1k,k\u2212n+m \u03b1m,n (k) \u03b2r,s (k) ,\n\n(13)\n\nk=n\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 are explicitly given by:\nh\ni1/2\n\u03b1m,n (k) = k(k \u2212 1) * * * (k \u2212 n + 1) * (k \u2212 n + 1)(k \u2212 n + 2) * * * (k \u2212 n + m)\n,\nh\n\u03b2r,s (k) = (N \u2212 k)(N \u2212 k \u2212 1) * * * (N \u2212 k \u2212 s + 1)\ni1/2\n\u00d7(N \u2212 k \u2212 s + 1)(N \u2212 k \u2212 s + 2) * * * (N \u2212 k \u2212 s + r)\n.\nSince Tr[\u03c1 A1 A2 ] vanishes by hypothesis, by choosing n = N \u2212s, one finally gets the condition:\nh\ni1/2\n\u03c1nm m! n! (N \u2212 m)! (N \u2212 n)!\n= 0,\nm<n;\n(14)\na similar condition holds for the case m > n. As a consequence, \u03c1mn = 0 for all m 6= n, and\nthus the original density matrix in (10) results diagonal in the Fock representation.6\nHowever, most observables of physical interest are non-local with respect to the bipartition\n(A1 , A2 ) given above. As we shall see in the next Section, the approach to phase estimation with BEC-based double-well interferometers is mainly based on the following collective\nbilinear operators:\nJx =\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2020\na1 a2 + a1 a\u20202 ,\n2\n\nJy =\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2020\na1 a2 \u2212 a1 a\u20202 ,\n2i\n\nsatisfying the su(2) algebraic relations:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nJx , Jy = iJz ,\nJy , Jz = iJx ,\n6\n\nJz =\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2020\na1 a1 \u2212 a\u20202 a2 ,\n2\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nJz , Jx = iJy .\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nFurthermore, one easily checks that the states (9) satisfy the separability criterion for continuous variable\nsystems introduced in ([61]).\n\n7\n\n\fThe effect of phase accumulation inside the interferometer can in fact be modeled through\nthe action of the exponential of a linear combination of these operators. It is interesting to\nnotice that, although the operators in (15), being linear combinations of both a1 , a\u20201 and a2 ,\na\u20202 , are clearly non-local with respect to the bipartition (A1 , A2 ), their exponentials are not\nall so. While ei\u03b8Jx and ei\u03b8Jy , \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], are non-local, the exponential of Jz turns out to be\nlocal:\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nei\u03b8Jz = ei\u03b8a1 a1 /2 * e\u2212i\u03b8a2 a2 /2 ,\nei\u03b8a1 a1 /2 \u2208 A1 , e\u2212i\u03b8a2 a2 /2 \u2208 A2 .\n(17)\n\nFurther, by changing the bipartition of the algebra of all operators A, one can transfer\nthis property to another of the operators in (15). For instance, let us introduce a new\nset of creation and annihilation operators b\u2020i , bi , i = 1, 2 through the following Bogolubov\ntransformation:\na1 \u2212 a2\na1 + a2\n,\nb2 = \u221a\n,\n(18)\nb1 = \u221a\n2\n2\nand their hermitian conjugates. Correspondingly, the three operators in (15) can be equivalently rewritten as:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\nJx = b\u20201 b1 \u2212 b\u20202 b2 ,\nJy =\nb1 b\u20202 \u2212 b\u20201 b2 ,\nJz = b1 b\u20202 + b\u20201 b2 .\n(19)\n2\n2i\n2\nIn analogy with what has been done before, one can now define a bipartition (B1 , B2 ) of\nthe full algebra A using the mode operators b\u2020i , bi instead of a\u2020i , ai . In this case, it is the\nexponential of the operator Jx that now turns out to be local:\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nei\u03b8Jx = ei\u03b8b1 b1 * e\u2212i\u03b8b2 b2 ,\n\n\u2020\n\nei\u03b8b1 b1 \u2208 B1 ,\n\n\u2020\n\ne\u2212i\u03b8b2 b2 \u2208 B2 .\n\n(20)\n\nThis explicitly shows that an operator, local with respect to a given bipartition, can result\nnon-local if a different algebraic bipartition is chosen.\nFrom the point of view of the states, the above Bogolubov transformation corresponds\nto a change of basis in the Hilbert space, from the one consisting of spatially localized\nstates (a\u2020i and ai create and destroy particles in the two wells), to\n\u0002 the one spanned\n\u0003 \u221a by\ntheir (spatially non-local) superpositions, as, for instance, b\u20201 |0i = a\u20201 |0i + a\u20202 |0i / 2 and\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u221a\nb\u20202 |0i = a\u20201 |0i \u2212 a\u20202 |0i / 2, which are energy eigenstates of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian\nin the limit of a highly penetrable barrier. As a consequence, the Fock states in (7) result\nentangled with respect to this new bipartition (B1 , B2 ); indeed, one finds:\n\u0013\nk N\n\u2212k \u0012 \u0013\u0012\nX\nX\n\u0001r+s \u2020 \u0001N \u2212r\u2212s\n1\nk N \u2212k\n1\n(\u22121)N \u2212k\u2212s b\u20201\nb2\n|0i , (21)\n|k, N \u2212ki = N/2 p\ns\n2\nk!(N \u2212 k)! r=0 s=0 r\nso that |k, N \u2212 ki is a combination of (B1 , B2 )-separable states. A similar conclusion applies\nto the mixed states (9). This explicitly shows that in the case of systems of identical particles,\nthe notion of separability can not be given abstractly, but must be associated to a specific\nbipartition of the full algebra A of operators. Because of their physical meaning, in the\nfollowing we shall refer to the (B1 , B2 ) bipartition as the energy bipartition, and call spatial\nbipartition the original (A1 , A2 ) one. We shall now apply these considerations to the problem\nof phase estimation in quantum interferometry with systems of identical particles.\n8\n\n\f4\n\nQuantum metrology with identical particles\n\nUltracold atoms trapped in a double-well optical potential realize a very accurate interferometric device: indeed, state preparation and beam splitting can be precisely achieved by\ntuning the interatomic interaction and by acting on the height of the potential barrier. The\ncombination of standard Mach-Zhender type interferometric operations, i.e. state preparation, beam splitting, phase shift and subsequent beam recombination, can be effectively\ndescribed as a suitable \"rotation\" of the initial state \u03c1in by a unitary transformation [9, 11]:\n\u03c1in 7\u2192 \u03c1\u03b8 = U\u03b8 \u03c1in U\u03b8\u2020 ,\n\nU\u03b8 = ei\u03b8 Jn .\n\n(22)\n\nn2x + n2y + n2z = 1 ,\n\n(23)\n\nThe phase change is induced by the generator\nJn \u2261 nx Jx + ny Jy + nz Jz ,\n\ni.e. by a general combination of the collective operators introduced in (15). In practice,\nthe state transformation \u03c1in 7\u2192 \u03c1\u03b8 inside the interferometer can be effectively modeled as\na pseudo-spin rotation along the unit vector ~n = (nx , ny , nz ), whose choice depends on\nthe specific realization of the interferometric apparatus and of the adopted measurement\nprocedure.\nGeneral quantum estimation theory allow a precise determination of the accuracy on which\nthe phase change can be measured in such devices: the accuracy \u2206\u03b8 with which the phase\n\u03b8 can be obtained in a measurement involving the operator Jn and the initial state \u03c1in is\nlimited by the following inequality [3]-[6]:\n\u2206\u03b8 \u2265 p\n\n1\nF [\u03c1in , Jn ]\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the quantity F [\u03c1in , Jn ] is the so-called quantum Fisher information. One can show\nthat in general [62]\n\u0010\n\u00112\nF [\u03c1in , Jn ] \u2264 4 \u2206\u03c1in Jn ,\n(25)\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\nwhere \u2206\u03c1in Jn \u2261 hJn2 i \u2212 hJn i2\nis the variance of the operator Jn in the state \u03c1in , the\nequality holding only for pure initial states, \u03c1in = |\u03c8ih\u03c8|.\nGiven the interferometer, i.e. given the operator Jn to be measured, one can optimize\nthe precision with which \u03b8 is determined by choosing an initial state that maximizes the\ncorresponding quantum Fisher information.\nIn the case of distinguishable particles,7 it has been shown that for any separable state\n7\n\nIndeed, the inequality involving F [\u03c1in , Jn ] given below (and similarly the set of inequalities discussed\nin [32]) has been proved by using the decomposition of the collective operators J\u03b1 , \u03b1 = x, y, z, in terms\nP (i)\n(i)\nof single-particle pseudo-spin: J\u03b1 = i J\u03b1 , where J\u03b1 refers to the i-th particle inside the trap. This is\npossible only if the particles are distinguishable. In the case of identical particles, single-particle operators\n(i)\nlike J\u03b1 are not addressable, otherwise one would be able to distinguish the particles by mean of them: only\nobservables that are symmetric with respect to all permutations of the N bosons, like the J\u03b1 's, are in fact\npermitted.\n\n9\n\n\f\u03c1sep the quantum Fisher information is bounded by N [25]:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF \u03c1sep , Jn \u2264 N .\n\n(26)\n\nThis means that by feeding the interferometer with separable initial states, the best achievable precision in the determination of the phase shift \u03b8 is bounded by the so-called shotnoise-limit (also called the standard-quantum-limit):\n1\n\u2206\u03b8 \u2265 \u221a .\nN\n\n(27)\n\nOn the other hand, quite in general, one finds\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF \u03c1, Jn \u2264 N 2 ,\n\n(28)\n\nso that an accuracy in phase estimation better than the shot-noise-limit is in principle\nallowed, eventually reaching the so-called Heisenberg limit, \u2206\u03b8 \u2265 1/N, obtained when in\n(28) the equality holds. And indeed, many efforts have been devoted in order to find suitable\ninput states \u03c1in and detection protocols that would allow such an ultimate sensitivity [7][33]. Notice that, because of (26), these states must be entangled. Actually, one can turn\nthe argument around and use the quantum \u0002Fisher\n\u0003 information for entanglement detection\n[25]; indeed, if for a state \u03c1 one finds that F \u03c1, Jn > N, than the state is surely entangled.\nWhen dealing with identical particles, as in the case of the condensed bosonic atoms confined in a double-well optical trap,8 these conclusions need to be re-qualified. As discussed\nin the previous Sections, the notion of separability requires the choice of an algebraic bipartition; for the case at hand, the spatial bipartition (A1 , A2 ) is a natural one: local operators\nare those that can be expressed as the product of polynomials in the creation and annihilation operators referring to the two wells. As shown earlier, with respect to this bipartition,\na generic separable mixed state \u03c1 is diagonal in the Fock basis (7), and can thus be written\nas in (9). For such a state, the quantum Fisher information can be explicitly computed:\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\nF \u03c1, Jn =\n\n(n2x\n\n+\n\nn2y )\n\n\u0014\n\nN +2\n\nN\nX\nk=0\n\n\u0015\nN\nX\npk pk+1\npk k(N \u2212 k) \u2212 4\n(k + 1)(N \u2212 k) .\npk + pk+1\n\n(29)\n\nk=0\n\nIn particular, in the case of a pure state, \u03c1k = |k, N \u2212 kihk, N \u2212 k|, this expression results\nproportional to the variance of Jn (cf. (25)),\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF \u03c1k , Jn = (n2x + n2y ) N + 2k(N \u2212 k) ,\n(30)\nand can always be made greater than N with a suitable choice of k. More specifically,\nwhen ~n lays in the plane orthogonal to the z direction, so that n2x + n2y = 1, one finds\n8\n\nWhen identical bosons are enough far away from each other so that their wavefunction do not spatially\noverlap, they effectively behave as distinguishable particles, and no symmetrization of the total wavefunction\nis needed [42]. However, this situation is hardly applicable to a gas of condensed ultracold atoms, where all\nparticles share the same quantum state.\n\n10\n\n\f\u0002\n\u0003\nthat F \u03c1k , Jn > N for all k. Recalling (24), this implies that in this case the phase un\u221a\ncertainty is smaller than 1/ N, thus beating the shot-noise-limit. Actually, when the\ntwo wells are filled by the same number of particles, so that the system is in the state\n\u03c1N/2 = |N/2, N/2ihN/2, N/2|, one can even get close to the Heisenberg limit, since in this\ncase:\n\u0002\n\u0003 N2\n+N .\n(31)\nF \u03c1N/2 , Jn =\n2\nTherefore, unlike in the case of distinguishable particles, the quantum Fisher information\ncan attain a value greater than N even with initial states that are separable with respect to\nthe spatial bipartition. As a consequence, in general, the inequality (26) does not play any\nmore the role of a separability condition when dealing with systems of identical particles.\nIn spite of this, we have just seen that the accuracy with which the phase change can\nbe determined in interferometers fed with such separable states can still beat the shotnoise-limit, provided that the rotation involved in the apparatus is not directed along the z\naxis.9 As observed before, such rotations are realized by operators that are non-local with\nrespect to the spatial bipartition.10 Therefore, given the (A1 , A2 ) bipartition, it is not the\nentanglement of the states fed into the interferometer that help overcoming the shot-noiselimit in the phase estimation accuracy; rather, it is the non-local character of the rotations\noperated\nby the apparatus on initially separable states that allows \u2206\u03b8 to be larger than\n\u221a\n1/ N, with the possibility of closely approaching the Heisenberg 1/N limit.\nThis result can be physically interpreted in another, equivalent way, which will shed further\nlight on the notion of separability when dealing with identical particles. The idea is to change\ndescription (and thus bipartition) through a suitable Bogolubov transformation, following\nthe discussion at the end of the previous Section.\nTake the unit vector ~n to lay in the plane orthogonal to the z axis, so that one can write\n~n = (cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6, 0), \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. Then, the generator Jn in (23) assumes the form:\nJn =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u2212i\u03c6 \u2020\ne a1 a2 + ei\u03c6 a1 a\u20202 ,\n2\n\n(32)\n\nwhich clearly shows that its exponential is non-local in the (A1 , A2 ) bipartition. Nevertheless,\nit can become local in a different, suitably chosen bipartition. To this aim, let us introduce\na new set of mode operators b\u2020i , bi , i = 1, 2 through the following Bogolubov transformation,\nthat slightly generalizes the one in (18):\nb1 =\n\na1 + e\u2212i\u03c6 a2\n\u221a\n,\n2\n\nb2 =\n\n9\n\na1 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03c6 a2\n\u221a\n,\n2\n\n(33)\n\nWhen ~n = (0, 0, 1), the quantum Fisher information (29) vanishes. From the physical point of view,\nthis results follows from the fact that the Fock states in (7) are eigenstates of the operator Jz , so that\nseparability is preserved by rotations generated by it: ei\u03b8Jz |k, N \u2212 ki = ei\u03b8(2k\u2212N ) |k, N \u2212 ki. In other words,\nin order to take advantage of the improvement in the accuracy of the phase determination, one has to use\nan experimental setup for which ~n 6= (0, 0, 1).\n10\nIn fact, only the exponential of Jz happens to be a (A1 , A2 )-local operator, as shown in (17).\n\n11\n\n\ftogether with their hermitian conjugates. In this new representation, one has:\nJn =\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2020\nb1 b1 \u2212 b\u20202 b2 ,\n2\n\n(34)\n\nso that the unitary operator that implements the rotation around ~n,\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nei\u03b8Jn = ei\u03b8b1 b1 /2 e\u2212i\u03b8b2 b2 /2 ,\n\n\u2020\n\nei\u03b8b1 b1 /2 \u2208 B1 ,\n\n\u2020\n\ne\u2212i\u03b8b2 b2 /2 \u2208 B2 ,\n\n(35)\n\nis indeed local with respect to the new bipartition (B1 , B2 ), where B1 is the subalgebra of\npolynomials in b\u20201 , b1 , while B2 is the one of polynomials in b\u20202 , b2 . In this new language,\nthe state |N/2, N/2i representing the situation of equal filling of the two wells, is no longer\nseparable with respect to this new bipartition; in fact, one finds (cf. (21)):\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\nN/2 \u0012\n\u0001k+l \u2020 \u0001N \u2212k\u2212l\neiN \u03c6/2 X N/2 N/2\n(\u22121)N/2\u2212l b\u20201\nb2\n|0i ,\n|N/2, N/2i = N/2\nl\nk\n2 (N/2)! k,l=0\n\n(36)\n\nwhile, as seen in the previous Section, any pure (B1 , B2 )-separable state must be a Fock state\nn\nm\nof the form b\u20201 b\u20202 |0i.\nDespite these changes, the value of the quantum Fisher information for the initial state\n|N/2, N/2i and the observable Jn is unchanged and still given by (31), since it does not\ndepend on the representation used to compute it. This means that if one is able to build an\nexperimental setup, together with a suitable measure procedure, which can be modelled in\nterms of the \"energy\" modes b\u2020i , bi instead of the original \"spatial\" modes a\u2020i , ai , then the\naccuracy \u2206\u03b8 with which the phase \u03b8 may be determined can still approach the Heisenberg\nlimit. In such a case, the improvement in sensitivity with respect to the standard shotnoise-limit is due to the (B1 , B2 )-entanglement of the initial state |N/2, N/2i and not to the\nnon-locality of the transformation that takes place inside the apparatus.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe standard notion of separability for a many-body system made of N distinguishable\nparticles is based on the natural tensor product structure of the Hilbert space in terms of\nthe single-particle Hilbert spaces: a state (density matrix) of the N-body system is separable\nif it can be written as the convex combinations of products of single-particle density matrices.\nIn the case of a system of identical particles, due to the symmetrization (or antisymmetrization, for fermions) principle, this definition becomes meaningless. It can be replaced\nby a generalized one, that makes use of a \"dual\" language, focusing on the algebra A of\noperators of the system instead of the set of its quantum states. One fixes a partition of A\nin terms of a set of commuting subalgebras and defines as separable those states for which\nthe associated expectation values of any factorized element of this partition can be written\nas a convex combination of products of expectation values. The notion of separability is thus\n12\n\n\flinked to a specific partition of A, so that a given many-body state can be separable with\nrespect to one partition, but result entangled with respect to a different one. Nevertheless,\nthis generalized definition of separability reduces to the familiar one expressed in terms of the\nsingle-particle tensor product structure in the case of a system of distinguishable particles.\nWe have applied these considerations to the specific case of a system of N ultracold atoms\ntrapped in an optical double-well potential, whose dynamics is very well captured by a twomode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. As we have seen, the second quantized language makes\nthe application to this case of the new, generalized notion of separability very transparent\nand further allows the discussion of various related issues in quantum metrology. In fact,\nthrough state preparation and trapping potential control, this system has been shown to\nrealize a highly sensitive Mach-Zhender interferometer, able to measure phase differences\nwith a very high accuracy.\nQuite in general, the square error (\u2206\u03b8)2 in the determination of the phase difference \u03b8\naccumulated inside the interferometer is bounded by the inverse of the quantum Fisher\ninformation F , whose value can not exceed N 2 . This gives the smallest possible error in\nthe estimation of the phase, \u2206\u03b8 \u2265 1/N, the Heisenberg limit, which,\u221afor large N, is a huge\nimprovement with respect to the standard shot-noise-limit, \u2206\u03b8 \u2265 1/ N.\nIn the case of a system of distinguishable particles, it has been proven that in order to\nbeat the shot-noise-limit in the accuracy of the phase determination one needs to feed the\ninterferometer with suitably N-body entangled states. Indeed, one can show that for all\nseparable states one has: F \u2264 N; as a consequence, the condition F > N \u221a\nsignals the\npresence of entanglement and at the same time allows \u2206\u03b8 to be smaller than 1/ N .11\nWhen the interferometer is filled with identical particles, the condition F > N is no longer\na univocal signal of state entanglement. Indeed, we have explicitly seen that in this case a\nquantum Fisher information larger than N may be obtained either via a non-local operation\non separable states or via local operations on entangled states. Notice, however, that the\nnotion of locality vs. non-locality and that of separability vs. entanglement need always to\nbe referred to given algebraic bipartitions of the full algebra of observables.\nMore specifically, in relation to the actual realization of a BEC-based interferometric experiment with a double-well optical trap, beam-splitting is usually implemented through\nlowering and raising of the inter-well potential barrier, while the subsequent phase estimation is obtained through number counting of particles inside the two wells. The algebraic\nbipartition that is relevant in this case is thus the spatial bipartition (A1 , A2 ), where local\n11\n\nMany-body entanglement has also been related to spin squeezing [27]-[33]. For instance, in the case\nof distinguishable particles, a state for which the inequality N (\u2206Jz )2 \u2265 hJx i2 + hJy i2 is violated is surely\nentangled and spin squeezed, since the variance of Jz is smaller than the standard quantum limit. Actually,\na complete set of inequalities obeyed by all separable states have been discussed in [32]: violation of just one\nof them is enough to signal entanglement. Let us remark that in the case of a system of identical particles,\nsome of these inequalities are violated even for separable states, thus loosing their role as entanglement\nwitness. In this respect, when dealing with systems of identical particles, spin squeezing does not seem an\nunambiguous, useful resource for quantum metrology. A detailed discussion of these points will be reported\nelsewhere.\n\n13\n\n\fobservables are those that can be expressed as the product of operators pertaining to the first\nand second well, respectively. A sub-shot-noise accuracy in the determination of the phase\ndifference \u03b8 can then be obtained by acting with a non-local operation, i.e. a transformation\ngenerated by Jx or Jy , on mode-separable states, e.g. the balanced Fock state |N/2, N/2i.\nNevertheless, as shown at the end of Section 4, a different point of view can be equivalently\nadopted: it is based on an alternate measurement protocol, in which the energy bipartition\n(B1 , B2 ) becomes relevant. In this case, a local operation suffices to get a sub-shot-noise phase\nestimation accuracy, provided it acts on an entangled initial state. The practical realization of\nsuch a new type of BEC-based interferometer is surely an interesting experimental challenge.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.C. Gerry and P.
