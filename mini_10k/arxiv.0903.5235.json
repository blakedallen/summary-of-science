In the special case n = 6 we determine an explicit formula for the (intersection) Betti numbers of a quotient variety,\ndepending only on the combinatorics of the weights of the polarization\nm \u2208 Z6>0 .\n\nIntroduction\nGeometric Invariant Theory gives a method for constructing \"quotients\" varieties for any linear action of a complex reductive algebraic group G on a projective variety X (see [6] and [1] for the general setting). The quotients depend\non the choice of an ample linearized line bundle L: in particular Dolgachev-Hu\n[2] and Thaddeus [7] proved that only a finite number of GIT quotients can be\nobtained when L varies and gave a general description of the maps relating the\nvarious quotients.\nIn this paper we restrict our attention to the case when G = PSL3 (C) acts\ndiagonally on X, the n-fold product of P2 (C), P2 (C)n (that we have already\nstudied in [5]) and describe the topology of an arbitrary quotient variety, both\ngeometric and categorical: as a main result we describe an algorithm to compute the (intersection) Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of any quotient variety. Moreover\nin the special case n = 6 we obtain an explicit formula for the (intersection)\nBetti numbers of a quotient variety, depending only on the combinatorics of the\nweights of the polarization m \u2208 Z6>0 .\nThe contents of the paper are more precisely as follows.\nSection 1 is concerned with the main features of the quotients of G =\nPSL3 (C) acting on X = P2 (C)n : we remind the main features of a categorical quotient X SS (m)//G and we describe the G ample cone C G (X). At the\nend we discuss the birational maps \u03b8\u00b1k that can relate different quotients.\nSection 2 discusses small resolutions: we give conditions for a birational map\n1\n\n\f\u03b8+k to be a small map, and we discuss the problem of the existence of a small\nresolution.\nIn Section 3 we give an algorithm that permits to compute the (intersecion)\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial of any quotient. The main key is the decomposition theorem of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne.\nSection 4 contains the special case n = 6: Theorem 4.2 contains an explicit formula for the (intersection) Betti numbers of any quotient: this formula\ndepends only on the combinatorics of the polarization m \u2208 Z6>0 .\n\n1\n\nG = PSL3 (C) acting on X = P2 (C)n\n\nFirst of all remind that PicG (X) \u223c\n= Zn : an ample line bundle L over X\nis determined by L = L(m) := L(m1 , . . . , mn ), where mi \u2208 Z>0 , \u2200i (supp.\nmi \u2265 mi+1 for all i : 1, . . . , n \u2212 1). Then the set of semi-stable points X SS (m) is\ndescribed byPthe Hilbert-Mumford numerical criterion; let x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 X\nand |m| := ni=1 mi :\n\uf8f1 P\n|m|\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nk,xk =y mk \u2264 3\nx \u2208 X SS (m) \u21d4\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n|m|\n\uf8f3 P\nm\n\u2264\n2\nj\nj,xj \u2208r\n3\nfor every point y \u2208 P2 (C) and for every line r \u2282 P2 (C). Moreover x is a\nstable point, x \u2208 X S (m), iff the numerical criterion (1) is verified with strict\ninequalities.\nThe numerical criterion can be restated as follows: if K and J are subsets\nof {1, . . . , n}, then we can associate them with the numbers:\nX\nX\nC\n\u03b3K\n(m) = |m| \u2212 3\nmk ,\n\u03b3JL (m) = 2|m| \u2212 3\nmj .\nk\u2208K\n\nj\u2208J\n\nIn particular we have: \u03b3JC (m) = \u2212\u03b3JL\u2032 (m) where J \u2032 = {1, . . . , n} \\ J.\nNow consider K \u2282 {1, . . . , n} with |K| \u2265 2 and the set VKC of configurations\n(x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 X where the points indexed by K are coincident and there are no\nfurther coincidences and no non-implied collinearities; in the same way, if J \u2282\n{1, . . . , n}, |J| > 2 consider the set VJL of configurations (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 X where\nthe points indexed by J are collinear and there are no further collinearities.\nIn order to study X SS (m) and X S (m), it is sufficient to consider the subsets\nVKC and VJL : in fact\nVKC \u2286 X SS (m) \u21d4 mi \u2264\n\n|m|\nC\nfor all i and \u03b3K\n(m) \u2265 0 ,\n3\n\nand\n\n|m|\nfor all i and \u03b3JL (m) \u2265 0 ,\n3\nwith similar statements for X S (m) (for more details, see [5]).\nMoreover we observe that if mi < |m|/3 for all i, then the number of coincident\nVJL \u2286 X SS (m) \u21d4 mi \u2264\n\n2\n\n\fpoints is at most n \u2212 3.\nNow consider a point\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03be \u2208 Z(m) := X SS (m)//G \\ X S (m)/G ;\n\nthis is the image in X SS (m)//G of different, strictly semi-stable orbits, that\nall have in their closure a closed, minimal orbit Gx, for a certain configuration\nx that has |K| coincident points, and the others n \u2212 |K| collinear; by the nuC\nL\nmerical criterion, we get \u03b3K\n(m) = 0 and \u03b3K\n\u2032 (m) = 0, where K indicates the\n\u2032\ncoincident points, while K = {1, . . .} \\ K indicates the collinear ones. In this\ncase \u03c6(VKC \u222a VKL\u2032 ) has dimension n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3, where \u03c6 is the projection map to\nthe quotient: \u03c6 : X SS (m) \u2192 X SS (m)//G.\nSome quotients are particularly easy to compute: let's consider two examples.\nExample 1.1. Consider a polarization m = (s, s, s, s, 1, 1, . . . , 1, 1) such that\n\uf8f1\n0 < s < 13 (4s + n \u2212 4)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n2\n1\n\u21d2 s > 2(n \u2212 4) .\n3 (4s + n \u2212 4) < 2s < 3 (4s + n \u2212 4)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n3s > 32 (4s + n \u2212 4)\n\nIn this case the quotient X SS (m)//G is isomorphic to the product of (n \u2212 4)\ncopies of P2 (C).\nExample 1.2. Consider the polarization m = (s, s, 1, 1, . . . , 1) such that\n\uf8f1\n0 < s < 31 (2s + n \u2212 2)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n7\n1\n(2s + n \u2212 2) < 2s < 32 (2s + n \u2212 2)\n\u21d2 n\u2212 < s < n\u22122.\n3\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1\nn \u2212 3 < 3 (2s + n \u2212 2)\n\nIn this case the quotient X SS (m)//G is isomorphic to the product of Pn\u22124 (C) \u00d7\nPn\u22124 (C).\nDolgachev and Hu proved in [2] that varying the line bundle L only a finite\nnumber of different quotients can be obtained: the space that parametrizes\nthese quotients is the G-ample cone C G (X), the convex cone in N S G (X) \u2297 R\nspanned by ample G-linearized line bundles L with XLSS 6= \u2205, where N S G (X)\nis the (N\u00e9ron-Severi) group of G-line bundles modulo homological equivalence.\nThis cone is subdivided in walls and chambers: a polarization L lies on a wall if\nand only if XLS ( XLSS . A chamber is a connected component of the complement\nof the union of walls: all the polarizations in a chamber define the same set of\nstable points.\n\n3\n\n\fIn our case\nC G (X) = {(m1 , . . . , mn ; \u03bb) \u2208 Rn \u00d7 R+ :\n\nn\nX\n\nmi = 3\u03bb, 0 \u2264 mi \u2264 \u03bb, i = 1, . . . , n}.\n\ni=1\n\nMoreover X S (m) ( X SS (m) if and only if there exists a subset K \u2282 {1, . . . , n}\nsuch that\nX\n|m|\nmi =\n;\n3\ni\u2208K\n\nthis is equivalent to the condition that L(m) belongs to the\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\nX\n|m| X\n|m|\n) \u2208 C G (X) :\n,\nmi =\nmj =\nHCK ,LK \u2032 = (m;\n\uf8f3\n3\n3\n\u2032\ni\u2208K\n\nj\u2208K\n\nThis is a codimension\u22121 wall.\n\nhyperplane\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n2\n|m|, K \u2282 {1, . . . , n} .\n\uf8fe\n3\n\nNow we want to introduce the birational maps that may be constructed\nbetween two quotients: they will be crucial in determining the Betti numbers\nof the quotients.\nLet m be a polarization such that 3 divides |m| and X S (m) 6= \u2205, X S (m) (\nX SS (m); let us consider \"variations\" of m as follows:\nm\nb = m \u00b1 (0, . . . , 0, |{z}\n1 , 0, . . . , 0) .\nk\n\nThen applying the numerical criterion we get X SS (m) \u2282 X S (m)\nb = X SS (m)\nb \u2282\nSS\nX (m): these inclusions induce a morphism\n\u03b8\u00b1k : X S (m)/G\nb\n\u2212\u2192 X SS (m)//G ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is an isomorphism over X S (m)/G, while over Z(m) is a contraction of\nsubvarieties. Moreover if the quotient X SS (m)//G is singular (possible for\nn \u2265 6), then \u03b8\u00b1k is a resolution of singularities: from now on we assume n \u2265 6.\nConsider a point \u03be \u2208 Z(m): for what we have already observed, \u03be is determined by a closed, minimal orbit Gx for a certain configuration x that has |K|\nC\nL\ncoincident points and the other n \u2212 |K| collinear (\u03b3K\n(m) = \u03b3K\n\u2032 (m) = 0).\n\u22121\nNow we want to calculate d, the dimension of \u03b8\u00b1k\n(\u03be): by the numerical criterion, only one between VKC and VKL\u2032 is included in X S (m).\nb\n+1\n\nk\nDealing with an elementary transformation of \"plus\" type (m\nb \u2212\u2192\nm), then\n\n- if k \u2208 K \u21d2\n\n\u22121\n\u03b8+k\n(\u03be) \u223c\n= Pn\u2212|K|\u22123 (C) ,\n\n- if k \u2208 K \u2032 \u21d2\n\n\u22121\n\u03b8+k\n(\u03be) \u223c\n= P2|K|\u22123 (C) ,\n\n4\n\nd = n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3;\n\n(3)\n\nd = 2|K| \u2212 3 .\n\n(4)\n\n\f\u22121\n\nk\nSimilarly, with an elementary transformation of \"minus\" type (m\nb \u2212\u2192\nm), we\nhave\nk \u2208 K \u21d2 d = 2|K| \u2212 3 ;\nk \u2208 K \u2032 \u21d2 d = n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3 .\n(5)\n\nFrom now on we will consider only elementary transformation of \"plus\" type,\n\u03b8+k ; in particular we want to study the properties of \u03b8+k : when \u03b8+k is a blow-up\nmap? When a small map?\n\n2\n\nSmall resolutions\n\nDefinition 2.1. A proper surjective algebraic map f : Y1 \u2192 Y2 between irreducible complex N -dimensional algebraic varieties is small if Y1 is nonsingular\nand, for all r > 0,\ncodimC {y \u2208 Y2 | dimC f \u22121 (y) \u2265 r} > 2r .\nA small resolution is a resolution of singularities which is a small map.\nSmall maps are particularly relevant, because they preserve intersection homology.\nProposition 2.2. Let X SS (m)//G be a quotient such that m lies on a 1 codimension wall of C G (X) and consider a variation of the weights m;\nb then the\nbirational map\n\u03b8+k : X S (m)/G\nb\n\u2192 X SS (m)//G ,\n\nis a small resolution if for each \u03be \u2208 Z(m), determined by a minimal closed orbit\nin VKC \u222a VKL\u2032 (2 \u2264 |K| \u2264 n \u2212 3),\n\uf8f1\nif 2 \u2264 |K| < n+1\n\uf8f2 2|K| \u2212 3\n3 ,\n\u22121\ndim(\u03b8+k (\u03be)) =\n(6)\n\uf8f3\nn \u2212 |K| \u2212 3\nif n\u22121\n3 < |K| \u2264 n \u2212 3 .\n\nRemark 2.3. Studying the subdivision in chambers and walls of the G-ample\ncone C G (X), the existence of a small resolution appears quite natural: consider\na polarization m that determines a singular quotient X SS (m)//G and lies on a\ncodimension\u22121 wall: each singularity of the quotient, determined by a certain\n\u03c6(VKC \u222a VKL\u2032 ), can be solved by the birational morphisms\n\u03b8+k : X S (m+ )/G \u2192 X SS (m)//G\n\nand\n\n\u03b8\u2212k : X S (m\u2212 )/G \u2192 X SS (m)//G\n\nwhere the polarizations m+ and m\u2212 lie on opposite chambers. In order to have\na small resolution we have to choose the \"right side\" of each wall.\nProof. The demonstration is based on the definition of small map: in order\nto verify the definition in our case, we have to consider the codimension of the\nsets\n\b\n\u22121\n\u03be \u2208 Z(m) | dim(\u03b8+k\n(\u03be)) \u2265 r\nfor r > 0. We have to distinguish two different cases:\n5\n\n\f\u22121\n1. if dim(\u03b8+k\n(\u03be) = 2|K| \u2212 3, then\n\n\b\n\u22121\ncodim \u03be \u2208 Z(m) | dim(\u03b8+\n(\u03be)) \u2265 2|K| \u2212 3\n> 2(2|K| \u2212 3)\n2(n \u2212 4) \u2212 (n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3) > 4|K| \u2212 6\n3|K| < n + 1 .\n\u22121\n2. if dim(\u03b8+k\n(\u03be) = n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3, then\n\n\b\n\u22121\ncodim \u03be \u2208 Z(m) | dim(\u03b8+k\n(\u03be)) \u2265 n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3\n>\n2(n \u2212 4) \u2212 (n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3) >\n3|K| >\n\n2(n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3)\n2n \u2212 2|K| \u2212 6\nn\u22121.\n\nIn other words \u03b8+k : X S (m)\nb \u2192 X SS (m)//G is a small map if for every \u03be \u2208\n\u22121\nZ(m), \u03b8+k (\u03be) has minimum dimension between 2|K| \u2212 3 and n \u2212 |K| \u2212 3.\nRemark 2.4. Combining the previous result and formulas (3) and (4), we can\nrestate Proposition 2.2 as follows: in the same hypothesis of 2.2, the birational\nmap \u03b8+k is a small resolution if for each \u03be \u2208 Z(m), determined by a minimal\nclosed orbit in VKC \u222a VKL\u2032 (2 \u2264 |K| \u2264 n \u2212 3),\n\u001a\n\u001a\nk \u2208 K\u2032\nk\u2208K\nor\n(7)\nn\u22121\n,\n2 \u2264 |K| < n+1\n3\n3 < |K| \u2264 n \u2212 3 .\nExample 2.5. Let us consider an example: n = 7, m = (9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1), |m| =\n30; this polarization lies on the codimension\u22121 wall HC17 ,L23456 .\nThe map \u03b8+6 : X S (9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 1)/G \u2192 X SS (m)//G is a small map, while\n\u03b8+1 : X S (8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1)/G \u2192 X SS (m)//G is not a small map.\nAs an immediate consequence we have IH\u2022 (X SS (m)//G) is isomorphic to\nH\u2022 (X S (m))\nb if \u03b8+k is a small map.\nIn general we have the following stronger result regarding the existence of small\nresolutions whose proof is the same of [4] Theorem 2.5, in the case of a torus\naction; in \u0001fact using the Gelfand-MacPherson correspondence, the moduli space\nP2 (C)SS (m)//SL3 (C) can be identified with a quotient in the Grassmannian\nGr(3, Cn ) acted on by the torus (C\u2217 )n\u22121 .\nTheorem 2.6. For every singular quotient X SS (m)//G, there exists a polarization m\nb such that m\nb lies on a chamber close enough to m and \u03b8 : X S (m)/G\nb\n\u2192\nSS\nX (m)//G is a small resolution.\nRemark 2.7. We have already proved the result for m lying on a codimesion\u22121\nwall; for higher codimension cases, the proof is based on the observation that a\ncodimension\u2212N wall is the intersection of N codimension\u22121 walls Hi and for\neach wall Hi (i = 1, . . . , N ) C G (X) \\ Hi has two connected components lying in\ntwo sides of Hi ; one of these components, named Ci,s , defines a small resolution\naccording to the previous result. Then the proof examines each wall, detects the\nright component Ci,s and studies their intersection for i = 1, . . . , N .\n6\n\n\fExample 2.8. Consider n = 8 and the polarization m = (19, 16, 7, 7, 6, 2, 2, 1):\nit lies on a codimension\u22123 wall, given by\nHC18 ,L234567 \u2229 HC267 ,L13458 \u2229 HC345 ,L12678 .\nA polarization m\nb such that \u03b8 : X S (m)/G\nb\n\u2192 X SS (m)//G is a small map is\nS\nm\nb = (19, 16, 7, 6, 6, 2, 1, 1): in fact X (m) \u2282 X S (m)\nb \u2282 X SS (m) and \u03b8\u22121 (\u03be)\nhas the correct dimension for each \u03be \u2208 Z(m). The polarization m\nb is obtained\nstudying the three codimension\u22121 walls in order to detect the right components\nand their intersection.\n\n3\n\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial\n\nLet us consider a quotient Y = Y (m) = X SS (m)//G and define the intersection Betti numbers of X SS (m)//G as\nibi (Y ) := dim IHi (Y, Q),\n\ni : 0, . . . , 4(n \u2212 4) .\n\nIf Y is non-singular, this definition coincides with the classical one.\nIn what follows we will use\nX\nti dim(Hi (Y ))\nP (Y ) =\ni\n\nto denote the ordinary Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of a variety Y and use\nX\nti * ibi (Y )\nIP (Y ) =\ni\n\nto denote the intersection Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of Y .\nWe have already stressed that small maps preserve intersection homology:\n\u223c\nif \u03b8\u00b1k : X S (m)/G\nb\n\u2192 X SS (m)//G is a small map, then H\u2022 (X S (m)/G)\nb\n=\nSS\nIH\u2022 (X (m)//G), and as a consequence the Betti numbers and the Poincar\u00e9\npolynomial are preserved.\nIn the previous section we have determined the conditions for a \u03b8+k map\nto be small, but in the general case \u03b8+k is not small. In this way in order\nto compute the Betti numbers for a general quotient it is necessary to use\nthe decomposition theorem of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne (in particular we will\nconsider the simplified version of [4]):\nTheorem 3.1.

The answer\nis at most four and there are two possible sets of points:\nO456 ,\nO456 ,\n\nO356 ,\nO356 ,\n\nO256 ,\nO346 ,\n\nO156 ,\nO345 .\n\nor\n\nFor example if m = (666621) then O156 , O256 , O356 , O456 \u2208 X SS (m)//G (this\nquotient is particularly easy to compute: it is P2 (C) \u00d7 P2 (C)).\nIn this way, in order to compute the intersection Betti numbers of a quotient\n12\n\n\fY (m) (both geometric and categorical) it is sufficient to know the intersection\nBetti numbers for a quotient Y (m\u2032 ) and then check how many VKL sets (with\n|K| = 3) are NOT included in X S (m): in fact for what we have just observed,\nwe can always \"connect\" two quotients by a finite sequence of maps that change\nthe Betti numbers if and only if they are blow-ups or blow-down of at most four\ncopies of P3 (C). These copies of P3 (C) are detected by the sets VKL that are\ncontained in X S (m), where K is one of the following:\n456, 356, 256, 156 or 456, 356, 346, 345 .\nConsider now the chamber of C G (X) that contains the polarization (5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1);\nthen for every polarization m in this chamber we have Y (m) = P2 (C) \u00d7 P2 (C)\nand moreover there are four sets VKL that are not included in X S (m). Its intersection Betti numbers are well-known and now we are able to compute all the\nBetti numbers:\n- if m\u2032 is such that X S (m\u2032 ) does NOT contain four sets VKL then its intersection Betti numbers are the same of P2 (C) \u00d7 P2 (C),\n- if m\u2032 is such that X S (m\u2032 ) does NOT contain three sets VKL then its intersection Betti numbers are the same of P2 (C) \u00d7 P2 (C) blown-up in one\npoint,\n- if m\u2032 is such that X S (m\u2032 ) does NOT contain two sets VKL then its intersection Betti numbers are the same of P2 (C) \u00d7 P2 (C) blown-up in two\npoints,\n- if m\u2032 is such that X S (m\u2032 ) does NOT contain one sets VKL then its intersection Betti numbers are the same of P2 (C) \u00d7 P2 (C) blown-up in three\npoints,\n- if m\u2032 is such that X S (m\u2032 ) contains all sets VKL then its intersection Betti\nnumbers are the same of P2 (C) \u00d7 P2 (C) blown-up in four points.\nThe relations of Theorem 4.2 compute the number of VKL sets that are included\nin X S (m).\n\nReferences\n[1] I.V.
