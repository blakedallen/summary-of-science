On the other hand,\n< 0.1). So the\nthe CHOOZ result 4 tells us that |\u03b813 | has to be small (sin2 2\u03b813 \u223c\nMNSP matrix looks like\n\nUMN SP\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nc\u2299 \u221a\ns\u2299\u221a\n\u01eb\u221a\n\u2243 \uf8ed \u2212s\u2299 /\u221a 2 c\u2299 / \u221a2 1/\u221a2 \uf8f8 ,\ns\u2299 / 2 \u2212c\u2299 / 2 1/ 2\n\nwhere I have used \u03b823 \u2243 \u03c0/4, sin2 2\u03b812 \u2261 sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 \u2243 0.8 and |\u01eb| \u226a 1.\nThe next thing to do is to determine \u03b813 , the sign of \u2206m232 and the CP\nphase \u03b4. During the past few years a lot of research have been done on the possibilities of future long baseline experiments. One is a super-beam experiment\nand the other one is a neutrino factory. The former is super intense conventional neutrino beam which is obtained from pion decays while the latter is\nfrom muon decays in a storage ring. The background fraction fB in the case\nof super-beams 7 is of order 10\u22122 , while in the case of a neutrino factory 8 it\nis or order 10\u22125 . The advantage of a neutrino factory is such low background\nfraction and neutrino factories are expected to enable us to determine \u03b813 and\n> 10\u22125 (10\u22123 ), respectively.\nthe sign of \u2206m232 (\u03b4) for sin2 2\u03b813 \u223c\nIn this talk I will mainly discuss measurements of the CP phase \u03b4 at\nneutrino factories and will try to clarify the reason why some group obtains\ndifferent results for the optimized muon energy and baseline.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMeasurements of the CP phase at neutrino factories\n\nMeasurement of the CP phase in neutrino oscillations is difficult not only because CP violating contribution in the oscillation probability is in general small\nbut also because there is matter effect. Namely, the dependence of the probabilities for \u03bd and \u03bd\u0304 on \u03b4 and A is given by P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) = f (E, L; \u03b8ij , \u2206m2ij , \u03b4; A)\nand P (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) = f (E, L; \u03b8ij , \u2206m2ij , \u2212\u03b4; \u2212A), where f is a certain func\u221a\ntion and A \u2261 2GF Ne stands for the matter effect. The quantity obtained\nfrom experiments on \u03bd\u0304 is not f (* * * , \u2212\u03b4; A), so that direct comparison between f (* * * , \u03b4; A) and f (* * * , \u2212\u03b4; A) is impossible in a strict sense. The situation here is different from the the K 0 \u2212 K\u0304 0 system where the quantity\nN (KL \u2192 2\u03c0)/N (KL \u2192 3\u03c0) immediately gives us evidence for CP violation.\nHence I have to compromise and adopt a kind of indirect measurement of CP\nviolation, i.e., I deduce the values of \u03b4 etc. by comparing the energy spectra of\nthe data and of the theoretical prediction with neutrino oscillations assuming\nthe three flavor mixing. In determining \u03b4, there are other oscillation parameters as well as the density of the Earth whose values are not exactly known,\nso that I have to take into account correlations of errors of these parameters.a\nThus I introduce the following quantity to see the significance of the case with\nnonvanishing \u03b4:\n(\u0002\n\u00032\nX\nNj (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) \u2212 N\u0304j (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc )\n2\n\u2206\u03c7 \u2261\nmin\n\u03c3j2\n\u03b8kl ,\u2206m2 ,A\nj\nkl\n\u0002\n\u00032\nNj (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) \u2212 N\u0304j (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc )\n+\n\u03c3j2\n\u0002\n\u00032\nNj (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) \u2212 N\u0304j (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc )\n+\n\u03c3j2\n\u0002\n\u00032 )\nNj (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) \u2212 N\u0304j (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc )\n,\n(1)\n+\n\u03c3j2\nwhere Nj (\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) \u2261 Nj (\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ; \u03b8kl , \u2206m2kl , \u03b4, A), N\u0304j (\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) \u2261 N\u0304j (\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\n\u03bd\u03b2 ; \u03b8kl , \u2206m2kl , \u03b4\u0304 = 0, \u0100) stand for the numbers of events of the data and of the\ntheoretical prediction with a vanishing CP phase, respectively, and \u03c3j2 stands\nfor the error which is given by the sum of the statistical and systematic errors.\nAt neutrino factories appearance and disappearance channels for \u03bd and \u03bd\u0304 are\nobserved, and I have included the numbers of events of all the channels in\na Correlations\n\nof errors at neutrino factories were studied in Ref. 9,10,11,12,13 .\n\n2\n\n\f(1) to gain statistics. In the present analysis, Nj (\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) is substituted by\ntheoretical prediction with a CP phase \u03b4 and \u2206\u03c72 obviously vanishes if \u03b4 = 0.b\nThe quantity \u2206\u03c72 reflects the strength of the correlation of the parameters, i.e.,\nif \u2206\u03c72 turns out to be very small for a certain value of \u0100 then the correlation\nbetween \u03b4 and A would be very strong and in that case there would be no way\nto show \u03b4 6= 0. To reject a hypothesis \"\u03b4 = 0\" at the 3\u03c3 confidence level I\ndemand\n\u2206\u03c72 \u2265 \u2206\u03c72 (3\u03c3CL)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the right hand side stands for the value of \u03c72 which gives the probability\n99.7% in the \u03c72 distribution with a certain degrees freedom, and \u2206\u03c72 (3\u03c3CL)=20.1\nfor 6 degrees freedom. From (2) I get the condition for the detector size to\nreject a hypothesis \"\u03b4 = 0\" at 3\u03c3CL.\nOn the other hand, Koike et al.11 claim that another quantity\n\u2206\u03c7\u03032 \u2261\n\nmin\n\u03b8kl ,\u2206m2\nkl\n\nX 1 \u0014 Nj (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) N\u0304j (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) \u00152\n\u2212\n\u03c3j2 Nj (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) N\u0304j (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc )\n,A\nj\n\n(3)\n\nshould be used since this particular combination improves the correlation between \u03b4 and A. In my opinion, however, both analyses with \u2206\u03c72 and \u2206\u03c7\u03032 are\nbased on indirect measurements of CP violation anyway and there is no reason\nwhy one has to discard other information on \u03b4. In fact it turns out that (3)\nis a combination in which the correlation between \u03b4 and A improves for low\nenergy and worsens at high energy.\nIt should be pointed out here that indirect measurements of CP violation\nare also considered in the B 0 \u2212 B\u0304 0 system.c To measure the phase \u03c61 , direct\nCP violating process B(B\u0304) \u2192 J/\u03c8 Ks is used 14,15 , while those to measure \u03c62\nand \u03c63 are B \u2192 2\u03c0 16 and B \u2192 DK 17 , which are not necessarily CP\u2013odd\nprocesses. Their strategy is to start with the three flavor framework, to use\nthe most effective process, which may or may not be CP\u2013odd, to determine the\nCP phases and to check unitarity or consistency of the three flavor hypothesis.\nThe optimized muon energy E\u03bc and baseline L for the measurement of\nCP the phase at a neutrino factory have been investigated by several groups\nby taking into consideration the correlations of \u03b4 and all other parameters\nand the results are summarized in Table 1. The results in Ref.13 are given\nin Fig. 2, which shows that the more uncertainty I have in the density, the\nshorter baseline I have to choose because the correlation between \u03b4 and A\nb This\n\nis the reason why the quantity in (1) is denoted as \u2206\u03c72 instead of absolute \u03c72 . \u2206\u03c72\nrepresents deviation from the best fit point rather than the goodness of fit.\nc The term \"indirect\" in the B system is different from that in neutrino oscillations.\n\n3\n\n\f\u03c62 : from B \u2192 2\u03c0\n\u260e\u2745\n\u260e \u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u03c6\n\u03c61 : from B(B\u0304) \u2192 J/\u03c8 Ks\n2\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n(direct)\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u03c63\n\u03c61 \u2745\n\u260e\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\u260e\n\u2745\n\n\u03c63 : from B \u2192 DK\nFigure 1: Unitarity triangle in the B meson system.

The works 12,13,18 ,\nwhich basically used \u2206\u03c72 in (1), agree with each other to certain extent (there\nare some differences on the reference values for the oscillation parameters) while\nthe result by Koike et al.11 is quite different from others. This discrepancy is\ndue to the fact that they adopted \u2206\u03c7\u03032 in (3) as was mentioned above. There\nare slight differences between the results by the group 12,18 and those by the\nother 13 and this appears to come from different statistical treatments. In the\nfuture it should be studied what makes a difference to get the optimum set\n(E\u03bc , L). The detector size required to reject a hypothesis \"\u03b4=0\" as a function\nof \u03b813 is given in Figure 3 (taken from Ref.19 ). Figure 3 shows the sensitivity\nof neutrino factories to the CP phase.\n3\n\nHigh energy behaviors of \u2206\u03c72\n\nSome people have questioned whether the sensitivity to the CP phase at a\nneutrino factory increases infinitely as the muon energy increases, and Lipari20\nconcluded that the sensitivity is lost at high energy. In the work 13 the behaviors of \u2206\u03c72 in (1) was studied analytically for high muon energy and it was\nshown after the correlations between \u03b4 and any other oscillation parameter or\n6\n\n\fD/kt\u2022yr\n\n10000\n\nE\u03bc=20GeV, L=1000km\nE\u03bc=20GeV, L=2000km\nE\u03bc=20GeV, L=3000km\nE\u03bc=20GeV, L=4000km\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n0.1\n\n1\n\n\u03b813/degrees\n\n10\n\nD/kt\u2022yr\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n0.1\n\nE\u03bc=50GeV, L=1000km\nE\u03bc=50GeV, L=2000km\nE\u03bc=50GeV, L=3000km\nE\u03bc=50GeV, L=4000km\n1\n\n\u03b813/degrees\n\n10\n\nFigure 3: Data size (kt*yr) required to reject a hypothesis of \u03b4 = 0 at 3\u03c3 when the true value\nis \u03b4 = \u03c0/2, in the case of a neutrino factory with 1021 useful muon decays per year and a\nbackground fraction fB = 10\u22123 .\n\n7\n\n\fA is taken into account that\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u00132\n\u0012\nJ\n1\n\u2206m232 L\n\u2206\u03c72 \u221d\ncos \u03b4\nsin \u03b4 + const\nsin \u03b4\nE\u03bc\nE\u03bc\n\n(4)\n\nfor large E\u03bc , where J \u2261 (c13 /8) sin 2\u03b812 sin 2\u03b813 sin 2\u03b823 sin \u03b4 stands for the\nJarlskog parameter. The behavior (4) is the same as that for \u2206\u03c7\u03032 in (3) and\nit is qualitatively consistent with the claim by Lipari 20 . It is remarkable that\n(4) is different from a naively expected behavior\n\u2206\u03c72naive \u221d E\u03bc (cos \u03b4 \u2212 1)2 .\nThis is because the correlation between \u03b4 and other parameters is taken into account. Koike et al.11 criticize the analysis with \u2206\u03c72 by saying that this quantity\n< E\u03bc \u223c\n< 50GeV).\nlooks mainly at the CP conserving part at high muon energy (10GeV \u223c\nThe behavior (4) indicates, however, that CP violating part becomes dominant\nafter the correlation between \u03b4 and other parameters is taken into consideration\nand the criticism by Koike et al.11 does not apply.\n4\n\nParameter degeneracy\n\nThe discussions in the previous sections have been focused on rejection of a\nhypothesis \"\u03b4 = 0\". Once \u03b4 is found to be nonvanishing, it becomes important\nto determine the precise value of \u03b4. It has been pointed out that various kinds\nof parameter degeneracy exist. Burguet-Castell et al.21 found degeneracy in\n(\u03b4, \u03b813 ), Minakata and Nunokawa 22 found the one in the sign of \u2206m232 , and\nBarger et al.23 found the one in the sign of \u03c0/4 \u2212 \u03b823 . To understand the\nfour-fold ambiguity it is instructive to draw a trajectory in the P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde )\n\u2013 P (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) plane (See Figure 4 taken from Ref.24 ). From Figure 4 it is\nobvious that there exists four-fold ambiguity for a given set of the oscillation\nparameters. Also the position of the ellipse has degeneracy in interchanging\n\u03b823 \u2194 \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b823 , so that in general eight-fold degeneracy is expected. 23 It was\nproposed 21,22,23 to do experiments at two baselines to remove this degeneracy.\nIn reality one has to evaluate numbers of events for \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e\n(Notice that Figure 4 deals with the probabilities only), and the correlations\nof errors have to be taken into consideration as well, so determination of the\noscillation parameters is even more difficult than what Figure 4 indicates.\n5\n\nSummary\n\nPeople in the field reached consensus that neutrino factories can measure the\n> 10\u22123\nCP phase \u03b4 with the detector size larger than 1021 \u03bc*100kt*yr for sin2 2\u03b813 \u223c\n8\n\n\fL = 295 km, <E> = 1.5 GeV\n1.6\n0.05, +\n0.05, \u2212\n0.0423, +\n0.041, \u2212\n\n1.5\n1.4\n\n<P(\u03bd)>\n\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1.0\n0\n\u03c0/2\n\u03c0\n3\u03c0/2\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n1.2\n<P(\u03bd)>\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of the clover-leaf ambiguity in terms of CP trajectory diagram.\n\nFour solutions exist for given values of P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) and P (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ).\n\nunless |\u03b4| is small.
