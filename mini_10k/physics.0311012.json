This network, also\nknown as the cytoskeleton, is formed primarily by filaments (actin filaments, microtubules\nand intermediate filaments), linked together by a large collection of accessory proteins [1].\nA complete description of the structural and mechanical properties of these filaments is\ntherefore essential in order to unveil the mechanical properties of the entire cell. Advances\nin the field have been significantly promoted by a unique set of optical and mechanical techniques which allow to visualize and manipulate single cytoskeletal filaments [2, 3, 4] and\nDNA [5]. Fluorescence videomicroscopy [6] and nano-manipulation [7] can be conveniently\nused to obtain quantities as the distribution function of the end-to-end distance [6] or the\nmechanical response to an external force in great detail and at the single molecule level.\nThese quantities are amenable to a direct comparison with theoretical models.\nThe main material parameter in the description of a polymer filament is its persistence\nlength, lp . It is defined as the typical length over which correlations of the tangent vectors\nof the filament contour decay. Polymers are considered to be flexible when their persistence\nlength is small compared to their total length L, or t := L/lp & 10. In this limit, they can\nbe well described by the minimal model of the Gaussian Chain [8]. Polymers of biological\nimportance, e.g. F-actin, are often semiflexible, meaning that their persistence length is\ncomparable to their total length. While flexible polymers are dominated by entropic effects,\nthe statistical mechanics of semiflexible polymers is strongly affected by their bending energy\nand the close vicinity of the classical Euler instability for buckling a rigid beam [9].\n~ of the end-to-end vector R,\n~ a simple Gaussian for a\nThe distribution function P (R)\nflexible polymer, is peaked towards full stretching and is completely non-Gaussian [10].\nThe mechanical response of a semiflexible polymer is highly anisotropic, depending on the\ndirection in which the force is applied [11]. These findings result in bulk properties of\nsolutions and networks that are completely different from the isotropic elasticity of flexible\npolymer solutions [12, 13]. In addition, the inextensibility constraint becomes crucial in\ndetermining the approach to full stretching upon the application of a force f , as reported\nby Marko and Siggia [5] for double\u2013stranded DNA.\nHere we investigate the mechanical and statistical properties of a single chain grafted\nat one end, a problem of direct relevance for force generation in cellular systems. The\nother end is either free, or subject to a constant transverse force, whose magnitude extends\n2\n\n\finto the non\u2013linear regime. We restrict ourselves to a two\u2013dimensional embedding space,\nsince in most experiments, fluctuations in one direction are severely restricted, or cannot be\nobserved. The generalization to a three\u2013dimensional space is straightforward and will be\nreported elsewhere [14].\nWe refer to the Wormlike Chain Model (WLC) introduced by Kratky and Porod [15].\nIn this framework, a polymer conformation is represented by a succession of N segments ~ti ,\nwhose direction is tangent to the polymer contour at the ith segment. Since the polymer\nis assumed to be inextensible, all segments ~ti have a prescribed length a = L/N. The\nHamiltonian is given by:\nH = \u2212\u03b5\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n~ti * ~ti+1 \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nf~ * ~ti ,\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the energy associated to each bond and f~ is a force eventually applied to the\nsecond end. It is also possible to define a continuum limit for a \u2192 0, N \u2192 \u221e, with Na = L\nand \u01eb = \u03b5a2 /N held fixed. The Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 is then equivalent to the following\nfunctional [16, 17]:\n\u03ba\nHf =\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nL\n\nds\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202~t(s)\n\u2202s\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212 f~ *\n\nZ\n\nL\n\nds ~t(s) ,\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03ba = \u01ebL and ~t(s) is the tangent vector of the space curve ~r(s) parametrized in terms\nof the arc length s. The inextensibility of the filament is imposed by the local constraint\n~t(s) = 1. The continuous version of the wormlike chain has been successfully used to\nobtain various statistical quantities, as the tangent-tangent correlation function or moments\nof the end-to-end distance distribution [16, 18]. It has been recently used to obtain the\nradial distribution function [10], and force-extension relations [5, 11, 19].\nWe have developed a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the behavior of a semiflexible\npolymer in the proximity of the limit t \u2192 1. The rationale behind this choice is the search\nfor clear hallmarks of the onset of the \"semiflexible\" nature of a filament. In this intermediate limit, analytical results are difficult to obtain: typical approximation schemes that\nbuild on either Gaussian chains or rigid rods are outside their validity range; hence, computer simulations become crucial. The first end of the filament is assumed to be clamped,\ni.e. the orientation of its tangent vector is held fixed along a direction, named the x-axis.\nThe second end is left free to assume any possible orientation. The initial configuration has\nbeen randomly chosen in the proximity of the full stretching condition, thus ensuring a fast\nconvergence to equilibrium. A new configuration is generated by changing the orientation of\n3\n\n\fone segment and accepted according to the standard Metropolis algorithm and the discrete\nHamiltonian, Eq. 1. Effects resulting from self\u2013avoidance are not considered, but we notice\nthat configurations where the chain folds back onto itself are strongly energetically suppressed for sufficiently stiff polymers. Results ceased to depend on the number of segments\nfor N = 50. On the order of 106 Monte Carlo steps per segment were performed, and results\nwere averaged over different runs, obtaining a perfect agreement between measured expectation values of the end-to-end distance hR2 i and hR4 i with known exact expressions. The\nradial distribution function was calculated and coincided with the analytic results in [10]\nwithin the accuracy thereby reported.\nHere we are interested in the probability distribution function P (x, y) of the free end\nin the plane determined by the direction of the clamped end (x-axis) and the transverse\none (y-axis). This quantity is directly accessible to experiments allowing for a quantitative\ncomparison with our predictions. We will also consider the reduced distribution functions\nP (x) and P (y), obtained by integrating P (x, y) over the variables y and x, respectively.\nIt is important to notice that when both ends are free, the radial distribution function is\nrotationally invariant and is therefore only a function of the distance R between the ends.\nClamping one end breaks rotational symmetry and leads to distinctly different longitudinal\nand transverse distribution functions, P (x) and P (y). Nonetheless, the broken rotational\nsymmetry does not affect the total energy of the configuration. This implies, and is in fact\nconfirmed by our simulations (data not shown), that the longitudinal distribution function\nP (x) coincides with the radial distribution function P (R) of the end-to-end distance, apart\nfrom a constant normalization factor. The characteristic feature of this function is a crossover\nfrom a universal Gaussian shape centered at the origin with a characteristic width determined\nby the radius of gyration, to yet another universal shape [10], whose peak is shifted towards\nfull stretching and whose width is determined by a new longitudinal length scale Lk \u221d L2 /lp .\nThis has to be contrasted with the transverse distribution function. Not surprisingly,\ngiven the intrinsic isotropy of flexible polymers, the distribution P (y) is a Gaussian and\nidentical to P (x) for high values of t. In the stiff limit, P (y), at variance with P (x),\nis again a Gaussian centered at y = 0, whose width is now given by a new transverse\np\nlength scale L\u22a5 = 2L3 /3lp [20, 21]. Surprisingly, at intermediate values the probability\n\ndistribution function is not a smooth interpolation between these two Gaussian limits but\nshows interesting and qualitatively new features.

Lengths are measured in units of L. Errors are comparable\nto the point size in the insets. (a) Appearance of double peaks for t . 2.5. (b) Re-entrance from\nthe double peaks to a flat distribution in the stiff limit t . 0.75. Insets show details of the crossover\nregions.\n\n(flexible side), the Gaussian peak is first smeared out into an intrinsically non-Gaussian\nflat distribution (see Fig. 1a). At t = 2.8 (see inset), the distribution contains three local\nmaxima, but as t is decreased, the central peak at y = 0 loses weight to the two symmetric\npeaks off the x axis. The double-peak structure is most pronounced around t \u2248 1.5, i.e.\nL \u2248 1.5lp .\nAs the stiffness is increased, P (y) recovers its flat structure, as shown in Fig. 1b. Notice\nalso (inset of Fig. 1b) that at t = 0.75 the two peaks start to compete with a growing peak\ncentered at y = 0, such that one finds a triple maxima shape again. Although intrinsically\nnon\u2013Gaussian, this central peak will eventually tend to a Gaussian distribution in the stiff\nlimit. The re-entrance from the double peak structure to a flat distribution is a genuine\n5\n\n\fhallmark of semiflexibility. This effect cannot be explained by analytical calculations using\na harmonic (or weakly bending rod) approximation, whose prediction for P (y) would be a\nGaussian centered at 0 [20]. Higher order cumulant expansions about a Gaussian distribution\nhave also failed to provide a fast convergence to our P (y). An entirely analytical solution\ncan be provided by the eigenfunction approach described in [22] for persistent random walks,\nalthough the connection to our probability distributions would only be numerical.\nFinally, let us emphasize that the double-peak structure of P (y) does not indicate a\nbistability in the constant force ensemble. As shown below, linear response theory leads to\npositive force constants in this regime. What actually happens under the application of an\nexternal force is that the distribution function becomes asymmetric and weight is shifted\nfrom one peak to the other. In an experimental setting with a fixed transverse distance y\nand a correspondingly adjusting force, one would probe P (y) directly and be able to observe\na kind of \"bistability\".\nFurther insight can be gained by the inspection of the joint distribution function P (x, y),\nrepresented with density plots in Fig. 2. In the stiff limit, P (x, y) should be confined to the\n\nFIG. 2:\n\nDensity plots obtained by Monte Carlo simulations: dense regions are colored in red,\n\nscarcely populated in blue on a color scale appropriately chosen to enhance the contrast. (a) t =\n2/3; (b) t = 1; (c) t = 2; (d) t = 20.\n\nclassical contour obtained by applying the elasticity equations to a rigid rod. This contour\ncan be approximated by a parabola in the proximity of full stretching and is obtained through\n6\n\n\felliptic functions for any deformation [9]. In Fig. 2a the classical contour coincides with the\nridge of the probability distribution function. As we relax the stiffness, thermal fluctuations\nwill make the tip of the filament explore the configuration space in the vicinity of the classical\ncontour. Roughly speaking, transverse (bending) fluctuations enhance fluctuations along the\nclassical contour and shift weight from the center to the upper and lower wings in Fig. 2a\u2013b.\nIn contrast, longitudinal fluctuations widen the distribution function perpendicular to the\nclassical contour. Since for a semiflexible polymer, the corresponding lengths Lk and L\u22a5\nscale differently (transverse fluctuations are much \"softer\" than longitudinal ones), upon\nlowering the stiffness P (x, y) gains more weight in the wings rather than in the center. It is\nprecisely this effect that gives rise to the double peak distribution, when P (x, y) is projected\nin the transverse direction (see Fig. 2b). Eventually, in the flexible limit, where transverse\nand longitudinal fluctuations become comparable, P (x, y) is spread so as to cover almost all\nthe available space (Fig. 2c), before the isotropic Gaussian distribution is recovered (Fig. 2d).\nWe have also explored the transverse response of semiflexible polymers by applying a\nconstant force f in the transverse direction. The effect of a small applied force on the\naverage end-to-end distance (or force extension relation) has been studied within linearresponse in [11]. In this work, we will consider the effect of an external transverse force of\narbitrary magnitude on the average position hxif and hyif of the free end.\nIn general, we expect hyif to have the same parity of the applied force, and hence to be\nodd, while hxif should not depend on the sign of the force and hence should be even. In\nthe continuum limit, it is possible to write down the exact expressions for hxif and hyif and\nto show that the expected parities hold on very general grounds and that the response of\nthe longitudinal extension to a transverse force is intrinsically nonlinear in the small force\nregime. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these predictions, as shown in Fig. 3. The response\nin the direction of the clamped end is even in f and it can be approximated by a parabola\ncentered on the f = 0 axis. The response in the transverse direction is odd in f and shows\nthe same re-entrance phenomenon reported in [11] for the linear response coefficient.\nNote that while in the case of a longitudinal force, the approach towards full stretching\n(or saturation) can be calculated within the weakly bending rod approximation, this is\nno longer true for transverse forces. The position of the free end can be calculated from\nclassical elasticity theory [9] and expressed by means of elliptic functions. Only in the high\nforce regime or in the stiff limit, when fluctuations become unimportant, results from our\n7\n\n\fsimulations coincide with classical elasticity theory.\nhxif 0.8\n\nt=5\nt=2\nt=1\nt=0.5\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nf\nhyif 0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\nt=5\nt=2\nt=1\nt=0.5\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nf\nFIG. 3: Response to a transverse force, obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. Forces are measured\nin units of kB T /L, lengths in units of L. Error bars are shown. (Above) Response in the clamping\ndirection. (Below) Response in the transverse direction is odd with f : only part of the explored\nparameter region is shown for clarity.\n\nThe effects hereby reported are amenable to a direct comparison with experiments regarding cytoskeletal filaments, or even DNA. For instance, optical systems might be used to get\nthe x or y projection of the radial distribution function for a particular class of semiflexible\npolymers. For F-Actin with lp \u2248 16 \u03bcm [6], the double peak effect should be well visible for\na range of lengths, 12 \u03bcm . L . 43 \u03bcm. In this parameter range the difference between the\ncentral relative minimum and the double peaks maxima results in 10% of the total length\n(see Fig. 1), in the range 1 \u00f7 4 \u03bcm that is well above the experimental precision of 0.05 \u03bcm\nreported by [6]. Hence F-Actin would provide an ideal benchmark for the effects we report.\nWe emphasize that the double peak structure is a clear hallmark of semiflexibility and hence\n8\n\n\fit might be used to obtain a rough estimate of the persistence length of a particular polymer\nfilament, as for instance the nanometer sized stalks of kinesins and myosins.\nIn summary, we have presented evidence from extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the\nparameter region corresponding to semiflexible polymers is hallmarked by the appearance\nof a series of effects in the radial distribution function and in the response of the clamped\npolymer to an external transverse force. A semiflexible polymer shows a distinct anisotropy\nin the probability distribution function of the free end along the direction of the clamped\nend. At intermediate stiffness, L \u2248 lp , the distribution function shows a pronounced double peak structure in the transverse direction. Semiflexible polymers have been previously\nreported [11] to be anisotropic objects, i.e. to respond in different ways to forces applied\nin the clamping or transverse direction. Here we have shown that even their response to\na force along the transverse direction alone is intrinsically anisotropic, being linear in the\ntransverse direction and non-linear along the direction of the clamped end in the small force\nregime.\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with P.
