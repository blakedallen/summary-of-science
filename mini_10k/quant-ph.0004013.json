I think in fact that the word \"measurement\" has been so\nabused in quantum mechanics that it would be good to avoid it altogether\"\nJohn S. Bell, 1985.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Heisenberg's (or uncertainty) Relations (HR) have a large popularity, being frequently regarded as crucial formulae of physics or (Martens 1991) even as expression of \"the\nmost important principle of the twentieth century physics\". Nevertheless today one knows\n(Bunge 1977) that HR \"are probably the most controverted formulae in the whole of the\ntheoretical physics\". The controversies originate in the association of the (supposed special)\ncharacteristics of measurements at atomic scale with HR respectively with the foundation\n\n2\n\n\fand interpretation of quantum theory. The respective association was initiated and especially sophisticated within the Traditional ( conventional or orthodox) Interpretation of HR\n(TIHR). Very often the TIHR is amalgamated with the so-called Copenhagen interpretation\nof quantum mechanics.\nElements of the alluded association were preserved one way or another in almost all\ninvestigations of HR subsequent to TIHR. It is notable that, in spite of their number and\nvariety, the mentioned investigations have not yet solved in essence the controversies connected with TIHR. But, curiously, today, large classes of publications and scientists seem\nto omit (or even to ignore) discussions about the controversies and defects characterizing\nthe TIHR. So, tacitly, in our days TIHR seems to remain a largely adopted doctrine which\ndominates the questions regarding the foundation and interpretation of quantum theory.\nFor all that (Piron 1982) \"the idea that there are defects in the foundations of orthodox\nquantum theory is unquestionable present in the conscience of many physicists\".\nNo doubt, first of all, the above quoted idea regards questions connected with TIHR.\nThen the respective questions require further studies and probably new views. We believe\nthat a promising strategy to satisfy such requirements is to develop an investigation guided\nby the goals presented under the following Points (P):\nP \u2212 1.1 : From the vague multitude of sophisticated statements of TIHR to identify its\nmain elements (hypotheses, arguments/motivations and assertions).N\nP \u2212 1.2 : To add together the significant defects of TIHR located in connection with the\nabove mentioned elements.N\nP \u2212 1.3 : To examine the verity of the respective defects as well as their significance\nwith respect to TIHR.N\nP \u2212 1.4 : To see if such an examination defends TIHR or irrefutably pleads against it.N\nP \u2212 1.5 : In the latter case to admit the failure of TIHR and to abandon it as an incorrect\nand useless doctrine.N\nP \u2212 1.6 : To see if HR are veritable physical formulae.N\nP \u2212 1.7 : To search for a genuine reinterpretation of HR.N\n3\n\n\fP \u2212 1.8 : To give a (first) evaluation of the direct consequences of the mentioned\nreinterpretation.N\nP \u2212 1.9 : To note a few remarks on some adjacent questions.N\nIn this paper we wish to develop an investigation of the HR problematic in the spirit of\nthe above mentioned points P \u2212 1.1 - P \u2212 1.8. For such a purpose we will appeal to some\nelements (ideas and results) from our works published in last two decades (Dumitru 1974 a,\n1974 b, 1977, 1980, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1996, 1999; Dumitru and Verriets\n1995). But here we strive to incorporate the respective elements into a more argued and\nelaborated approach. Also we try to make our exposition as self-contained as possible so\nthat the reader should find it sufficiently meaningful and persuasive without any important\nappeals to other texts.\nThrough the announced investigation we shall find that all the main elements of TIHR\nare affected by insurmountable defects. Therefore we shall reveal the indubitable failure\nof TIHR and the necessity of its abandonment. Then it directly follows that in fact HR\ndo not have any significance connected with the (measuring) uncertainties. That is why\nin this paper for the respective relations we do not use the wide-spread denomination of\n\"uncertainty relations\".\nA consequence of the above alluded revelations is the fact that HR must be deprived of\ntheir quality of crucial physical formulae. So we come in consonance with the guess (Dirac\n1963) that: \"uncertainty relations in their present form will not survive in the physics of\nfuture\".\nThe failure of TIHR leaves open a conceptual space which firstly requires justified answers\nto the questions from P \u2212 1.6 and P \u2212 1.7. The respective answers must be incorporated\nin a concordant view about the subjects of the following points:\nP \u2212 1.10 : The genuine description of the measurements.N\nP \u2212 1.11 : The foundation and the interpretation of the actually known quantum\ntheory.N\n\n4\n\n\fThe above mentioned subjects were amalgamated by TIHR trough a lot of assertions/assumptions which now appear as fallacious. That is why we suggest that an useful\nview to be built on a natural differentiation of the respective subjects.\nIn such a view the actual quantum theory must be considered as regarding only intrinsic\nproperties of the entities (particles and fields) from the microworld. The aspects of the\nrespective properties included in the theoretical version of HR refer to the stochastic characteristics of the considered entities. But note that stochastic attributes are specific also in\nthe case some macroscopic physical systems (e.g. thermodynamical ones), characterized by\na class of macroscopic formulae similar with HR. Also the Planck's constant ~ (involved in\nquantum HR) proves itself to be similar with the Boltzmann's constant k (involved in the\nmentioned macroscopic formulae). Both mentioned constants appear as generic indicators\nof stochasticity.\nIn the spirit of the above suggested view the description of the measurements remains\na question which is extrinsic as regards the properties of the considered physical systems.\nAlso it must be additional and independent from the actually known branches of theoretical physics (including the quantum mechanics). The respective branches refer only to the\nintrinsic properties of the considered systems. Then the measurements appear as processes\nwhich supply out-coming (received) information/data about the intrinsic properties of the\nmeasured systems. So regarded the measurements can be described through some mathematical models. In such models the measuring uncertainties can be described by means of\nvarious estimators.\nThe above announced views about the HR problematic facilitate reconsiderations and\n(we think) nontrivial comments about some questions regarding the foundations of quantum\nmechanics.\nFor developing our exposition in the next sections we will quote directly only a restricted\nnumber of references. This because our goal is not to give on exhaustive review of the\nliterature dealing with TIHR. The readers interested in such reviews are invited to consult\nthe known monographical and bibliographical publications (e.g.: Jammer, 1966; De Witt and\n5\n\n\fGraham, 1971; Jammer, 1974; Nilson, 1976; Yanase et. al. 1978; Primas, 1981; Ballentine,\n1982; Cramer, 1986; Dodonov and Man'ko, 1987; Martens, 1991; Braginski and Khalili,\n1992; Omnes 1992,1994; Bush et. al., 1996).\n\nII. THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF T I H R\n\nIn spite of its popularity, in its promoting literature, TIHR is reported rather as a vague\nmultitude of sophisticated statements but not as a systematized ensemble of clearly defined\nmain elements (hypotheses, arguments/motivations and assertions). However, from the\nrespective publications there can be identified and sorted out such on ensemble which, in\nour opinion, can be presented as follows:\nOn the best authority (Heisenberg, 1977) today it is known that the TIHR story originates in the search of general answers to the primary questions mentioned under the following\npoints:\nP \u2212 2.1 :Are all measurements affected by measuring uncertainties ?N\nP \u2212 2.2 :How can the respective uncertainties be represented quantitatively in a mathematical scheme ?N\nIn connection with P \u2212 2.1,TIHR adopted the following hypotheses:\nP \u2212 2.3 :The measuring uncertainties are due to the perturbations of the measured\nsystem as a result of its interactions with the measuring instrument.N\nP \u2212 2.4 :In the case of macroscopic systems the mentioned perturbations can be made\narbitrarily small and, consequently, always the corresponding uncertainties can be considered\nas negligible.\nP \u2212 2.5 :In the case of quantum systems (microparticles of atomic size) the alluded\nperturbations are essentially unavoidable and consequently for certain measurements (see\nbelow P \u2212 2.12) the corresponding uncertainties are non-negligible.N\nIn the shadow of the hypotheses mentioned in P \u2212 2.4 and P \u2212 2.5 the TIHR attention\nwas limited only to the quantum cases. For approaching such cases with respect to P \u2212 2.4\n6\n\n\fTIHR restored to the following motivation resources:\nP \u2212 2.6 :Analysis of some thought (gedanken) measuring experiments.N\nP \u2212 2.7 : Appeal to some theoretical formulae from the existing quantum mechanics.N\nThe two resources were used in undisguised association. So, from the starting-point, in\nTIHR the questions regarding the description of the measurements, respectively the foundation and interpretation of the existing quantum theory, were explicitly amalgamated..\nFor accuracy of the discussions in the following we shall use the term variable in order to\ndenote a physical quantity which describes a specific property/characteristic of a physical\nsystem. With adequate delimitations the respective term will be used in both theoretical\nand experimental sense. In the former case it is connected with the theoretical modeling\nof system. In the latter case it is related with the data given by measurements about the\nsystem.\nIn connection with P \u2212 2.6 there was considered (Heisenberg, 1927, 1930) the case of\nsimultaneous measurements of two (canonically) conjugated quantum variables A and B\n(such are coordinate q and momentum p or time t and energy E). The correspondingly\nThought Experimental (TE) uncertainties are \u2206T E A and \u2206T E B. They were found to be\ninterconnected trough the following A-B formula\n\u2206T E A * \u2206T E B \u2248 ~\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere ~ is the quantum Planck's constant.\nAs regards P \u2212 2.7 firstly there was introduced (Heisenberg 1927, 1930) the following\nq-p theoretical formula:\n\u2206\u03a8 q * \u2206\u03a8 p \u2265\n\n~\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\n(with equality only for Gaussian wave function \u03a8). Afterwards, TIHR partisans replaced\nEq. (2.2) by the more general A-B theoretical formula\n1\n\u2206\u03a8 A * \u2206\u03a8 B \u2265 *\n2\n\n\u001ch\ni \u001d\nbB\nb\nA,\n\u2212\n\n7\n\n\u03a8\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fh\ni\nh\ni\nbB\nb denotes the commutator of the quantum operators A\nb and B,\nb with A,\nbB\nb =\nHere A,\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00b1i~ in the case of conjugated variables. (For further details about the quantum notations,\nin actual usance version, see below the Sec. V).\n\nEquations (2.1) - (2.2)/(2.3) were taken by TIHR as motivation supports. Based on the\nsuch supports TIHR partisans promoted a whole doctrine (vision). The main (essential)\nelements of the respective doctrine come down to the following points, grouped in pairs of\nAssertions (A) and Motivations (M):\nP \u2212 2.8/A : The quantities \u2206T E A and \u2206\u03a8 A from Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2)/(2.3) denoted\nby an unique symbol \u2206A, have an identical significance of measuring uncertainty for the\nquantum variable A.N\nP \u2212 2.8/M : The above mentioned TIHR presumptions about \u2206T E A and the (formal)\nresemblance between Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2).N\nP \u2212 2.9/A : Equations (2.1) and (2.2)/(2.3) admit the same generic interpretation of\nuncertainty relations for simultaneous measurements of the variables A and B.N\nP \u2212 2.9/M : The presumed significance for \u2206T E A and \u2206T E B from Eq. (2.1) and the\nresemblance between Eqs. (2.1) and (2.12/(2.3).N\nP \u2212 2.10/A : A solitary quantum variable A can be measured without any uncertainty\n(with unlimited accuracy).N\nP \u2212 2.10/M : For such a variable, considered independently from other variables, the\nEqs. (2.1) - (2.3) do not impose a lower bound for the uncertainty \u2206A.N\nP \u2212 2.11/A : Two commutable variables A and B can be measured simultaneously with\narbitrarily small (even null) uncertainties \u2206A and \u2206B.N\nh\ni\nbB\nb = 0 and in Eq. (2.3) the product \u2206A * \u2206B\nP \u2212 2.11/M : For such variables A,\n\u2212\n\nhas not a lower bound.N\n\nP \u2212 2.12/A : Two non-commutable variables A and B can be measured simultaneously\nonly with non-null and interdependent uncertainties \u2206A and \u2206B.N\nh\ni\nbB\nb 6= 0 and in Eq. (2.3) as well as in Eq. (2.1) the\nP \u2212 2.12/M : In such a case A,\n\u2212\n\n8\n\n\fproduct \u2206A * \u2206B of the corresponding simultaneous uncertainties has as a lower bound a\nnon-null quantity.N\nP \u2212 2.13/A : The HR defined by Eqs. (2.1) - (2.3) (and named uncertainty relations) are\ntypically quantum formulae and they have no similar in classical (non-quantum) physics.N\nP \u2212 2.13/M : Presence of the quantum (Planck) constant ~ in Eqs. (2.1) - (2.3) and its\nabsence in all known formulae of classical physics.N\nThe above mentioned points P 99K 2.8 \u2212 P \u2212 2.13 can be regarded as main elements of\nTIHR. This because any piece of the variety of TIHR statements is obtained and advocated\nby means of some combinations of the respective elements.\nAmong the alluded pieces we mention here the ones regarding the mutual relations of\nquantum variables. TIHR adopted the idea:\nP \u2212 2.14 : A variable exists /(can be defined) only when it is measurable with absolute\naccuracy (without uncertainty).N\nBy combining this idea with P \u2212 2.11 and P \u2212 2.12 in the TIHR literature it is often\npromoted the statement:\nP \u2212 2.15 : Two quantum variables are compatible respectively incompatible as their\noperators are respectively are not commutable. Consequently a complete description of a\nquantum system must be made in terms of a set of mutually compatible variables.N\nIn the same literature one finds also the opinion that:\nP \u2212 2.16 : Two incompatible variables (especially the canonically conjugated ones) are\ncomplementary (i.e. mutually exclusive) - similarly as in the complementarity relation for\nthe corpuscular and wave characteristics of microparticles of atomic size.N\n\nIII. A FEW REMARKS ON T I H R HISTORY\n\nTIHR was initiated by Heisenberg but later on it was developed and especially promoted\nby the Copenhagen School guided by N. Bohr. In a first stage TIHR had a relatively\nmodest motivation, based only on the Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2). However it was largely accepted\n\n9\n\n\fin scientific and academic communities, partly due to the authority of its promoters. So,\nthe establishing of TIHR as a doctrine started.\nIn a second stage TIHR partisans introduced a multitude of thought-experimental or\ntheoretical formulae which resemble more or less the Eqs. (2.1)-(2.3). In spite of their (conceptual and/or mathematical) diversity the respective formulae were declared as uncertainty\nrelations and their existence and interpretation were regarded as supports for an extended\nmotivation of TIHR. So, for its partisans, TIHR was viewed as a well established and irrefutable doctrine. Such a view was widely promoted in leading publications (especially in\ntextbooks).\nIn the meantime the alluded view was confronted with the notification of some defects\nof TIHR. But, as a rule, the respective notifications appeared disparately, sometimes in\nmarginal publications and from non-leading authors. So the mentioned defects were not presented as a systematized ensemble and TIHR was criticized on certain points but not in its\ntotality. An appreciation viewing somehow the alluded totality was noted altogether solitarily (Primas 1981). Referring to the post-Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics\nit says: \"Heisenberg \u0301s uncertainty relations are no longer at the heart of the interpretation\nbut are simple consequences of the basic mathematical formalism\". Here one should remark\nthat, as we know, such an appreciation has never been used in order to elucidate the shortcomings of the TIHR doctrine. Moreover it seems that, even in the our-days publications\nregarding the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the respective appreciation is not taken\nproperly into account.\nIn the presented circumstances the TIHR partisans ignored or even denied the alluded\ndefects. Such an attitude was sustained mainly by putting forward thought experiments\nand/or the authority of the mentioned partisans. But note that, in this way, for most of the\ncases, the notifications of TIHR defects were not really counteracted and the corresponding\ncontroversies were not elucidated. For all that TIHR survived over the decades with the\nappearance of an uncontroversial doctrine and became a veritable myth. Undoubted signs\nof the respective myth are present even today in publications (especially in textbooks) and\n10\n\n\fin the thinking of peoples (particularly in academic communities).\nHere, it is interesting to observe Heisenberg \u0301s own attitude towards TIHR story. It\nis surprising to see in the afferent literature that, although he was the initiator of TIHR\ndoctrine, Heisenberg was not involved in the subsequent history of the respective doctrine. So\nhe did not develop mathematical generalizations or interpreting extensions/sophistications\nof the Eqs. (2.1)-(2.3). Also he did not participate in the controversies regarding the TIHR\ndefects. Probably that was the reason why in one of his last publications on HR (Heisenberg,\n1977) he did not refer to such developments and controversies but reminded only his thoughts\nconnected with the beginning of the TIHR history. Can the alluded attitude be regarded as\nan evidence of the supposition that in fact Heisenberg was conscious of the insurmountable\ndefects of TIHR ? A pertinent answer to such a question is expected to be (eventually)\nknown by the publication of all volumes of a planned monography (Mehra and Rechenberg,\n1982) due, in part, to one of Heisenberg \u0301s last collaborators.\nWith the Heisenberg case one discloses a particularity in the attitude of many scientists\nwho promoted TIHR. As individuals, each of the respective scientists did not regard the\nTIHR as a whole doctrine but argued for only a few of its elements and ignored almost all of\nthe defects. Often their considerations were amalgamated with ideas which do not pertain\nstrictly to TIHR. That is why, probably, by the term TIHR-partisans it is more adequate\nto understand a fuzzy class of people rather than a rigorously delimited group of scientists.\nNow looking back over the time, we believe that the verity and true significance of TIHR\ndefects still remain open questions which require to be elucidated.. Such a requirement\nimplies the necessity of an argued and complete revaluation of TIHR. Then, there directly\nappears the need for a search of a genuine reinterpretation of HR. The alluded beliefs will\nguide our investigations in the following sections.\n\n11\n\n\fIV. STARTING CONSIDERATIONS OF T I H R\n\nTIHR introduced its main elements presented in P \u2212 2.8 - P \u2212 2.13 by appealing to\nsome starting considerations about the Eqs. (2.1)-(2.3). The appeals viewed the scientific\nachievements from the first years of quantum mechanics.. Here, for a correct (re)evaluation\nof TIHR, it is the place to remember briefly the respective considerations.\nFirstly it must be noted that the Eqs. (2.1) were introduced by using the wave characteristics of quantum microparticles. Consequently the quantum measurements were regarded\nby similitude with the optical ones. But in the mentioned years the performances of the\noptical measurements were restricted by the classical limitative criteria of resolution (due to\nAbbe and Rayleigh). Then TIHR promoted as starting consideration the following point:\nP \u2212 4.1: The estimation of performances respectively of uncertainties for the quantum\nmeasurements must be done by using the alluded limitative criteria, transposed in quantum\nframework through de Broglie formula \u03bb = h/p (\u03bb = wave lenght).N\nBy means of this consideration TIHR partisans obtained some relations similar with Eqs.\n(2.1), for all the thought-experiments promoted by them.\nReferring to the Eqs. (2.2)-(2.3) the starting considerations promoted by TIHR can be\nresumed as follows. The state of a quantum microparticle is described by the wave function\n\u03a8 = \u03a8(q) regarded as a vector in a Hilbert space (q denotes the set of specific orbital\nvariables). In the respective vectorial space the scalar product (\u03a8a , \u03a8b ) of two functions \u03a8a\nand \u03a8b is given by\n(\u03a8a , \u03a8b ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a8\u2217a \u03a8a d\u03a9q\n\n(4.1)\n\n\u03a9q\n\nwhere \u03a8\u2217a =the complex conjugate of \u03a8a , whereas \u03a9q and d\u03a9q denote the accessible respectively infinitesimal domains in q-space. A quantum variable A is described by the operator\nb and its expected (mean) value hAi is defined by\nA\n\u03a8\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb\nhAi\u03a8 = \u03a8, A\u03a8\n\nThe quantity \u2206\u03a8 A from Eqs. (2.2)-(2.3) is defined as follows:\n12\n\n(4.2)\n\n\f\u0010\n\u0011\nb \u03b4\u03a8 A\u03a8\nb\nD\u03a8 A = \u03b4\u03a8 A\u03a8,\n,\n\u2206\u03a8 A =\n\np\n\nb=A\nb \u2212 hAi\n\u03b4\u03a8 A\n\u03a8\n\nD\u03a8 A\n\n(4.3)\n\nThen for two variables A and B the following evident relation was appealed\n\u0010\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011 \u0011\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\u03b1\u03b4\u03a8 A \u2212 i\u03b4\u03a8 B \u03a8, \u03b1\u03b4\u03a8 A \u2212 i\u03b4\u03a8 B \u03a8 \u2265 0\n\n(4.4)\n\nwith \u03b1 an arbitrary and real parameter. In the TIHR literature this relation is transcribed\ninto the formula\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011 \u0011\nb\nb\nb\n\u03a8, \u03b1\u03b4\u03a8 A + i\u03b4\u03a8 B \u03b1\u03b4\u03a8 A \u2212 i\u03b4\u03a8 B \u03a8 \u2265 0\n\nwhich is equivalent with the relation\n\u001c h\ni \u001d\n2\n2\nbB\nb\n\u03b1 (\u2206\u03a8 A) \u2212 \u03b1 i A,\n+ (\u2206\u03a8 B)2 \u2265 0\n\u2212\n\n(4.5)\n\n(4.6)\n\n\u03a8\n\nh\ni\nbB\nb =A\nbB\nb\u2212B\nbA\nb is the commutator of the operators A\nb and B.\nb As Eq. (4.6) is\nwhere A,\n\u2212\n\nsatisfied for any value of \u03b1 it directly results.\n\n1\n(\u2206\u03a8 A) * (\u2206\u03a8 B) \u2265\n4\n2\n\n2\n\nor\n1\n\u2206\u03a8 A * \u2206\u03a8 B \u2265\n2\nThis latter formula is just the Eq. (2.3).\n\n\u001c h\ni \u001d2\nb\nb\ni A, B\n\u2212\n\n\u001ch\ni \u001d\nb\nb\nA, B\n\u2212\n\n(4.7)\n\n\u03a8\n\n(4.8)\n\u03a8\n\nNow we point out here the following notable facts. The above mentioned starting considerations were founded on old scientific achievements. For all that, they are preserved and\npromoted in an unchanged form even in today \u0301s literature (especially in textbooks).\n\nV. ULTERIOR SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nFor an up-to-date re-evaluation of TIHR the above mentioned starting considerations\nmust be supplemented with elements regarding some ulterior scientific achievements. The\n13\n\n\frespective elements were reported in the decades after the debut of quantum mechanics but,\nsurprisingly, even today they seem to have little popularity. Our alluded supplement regards\nthe following things.\nFirstly let us refer to the thought-experimental Eqs. (2.1) and, correspondingly, to\nthe limitative criteria involved in the starting consideration mentioned in P \u2212 4.1. In the\nlast decades, in optical measurements, some super-resolution techniques have been achieved\n(Roychoudhuri, 1978; Scheer et. al., 1989; Croca et al., 1996). The performances of the\nrespective techniques overstep the alluded limitative criteria. Then it seems to be possible\nthat instead of P \u2212 4.1 one should operate with the following up-to-date consideration:\nP \u2212 5.1 : The accuracies and uncertainties of the quantum measurements can be estimated by transposition in adequate terms (by means of de Broglie formula \u03bb = h/p)of the\nmentioned super-resolution performances.N\nBased on this consideration, it is easy to imagine some Super-Resolution Thought\nExperiments (SRTE). Then for the measurement of two variables A and B the corresponding uncertainties are \u2206SRT E A and \u2206SRT E B. By rationating similarly as in the case of Eq.\n(2.1) one finds\n\u2206SRT E A * \u2206SRT E B < ~\n\n(5.1)\n\nThis SRT E - relation must be taken into account for un up-to-date re-evaluation of TIHR.\nNow let us refer to some ulterior achievements connected with the theoretical Eqs. (2.2)(2.3) or (4.8). The respective achievements regard mathematical generalizations of the Eq.\n(4.8). Note that there is known (Dodonov and Man \u0301ko, 1987; Dumitru, 1988) a large variety\nof such generalized relations. But here we shall consider only a few of the respective relations\nwhich are of direct significance for the questions approached in this paper.\nThen we consider a quantum microparticle for which the orbital state and variables are\nbk (k = 1, 2, .....n). With the\ndescribed by the wave function \u03a8 respectively by the operators A\n\nsame significance of notations as in Eqs. (4.1)-(4.4), we can define the correlations:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nbj \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 A\nbk \u03a8\nC\u03a8 (Aj Ak ) = \u03b4\u03a8 A\n14\n\n\fD\u03a8 Aj = C\u03a8 (Aj Aj ) , \u2206\u03a8 Aj =\n\np\n\nD\u03a8 Aj\n\n(5.2)\n\nIf \u03b1k (k = 1, 2, ....., n) are a set of arbitrary and complex parameters we can write the evident\nrelation\nn\nX\nk=1\n\nbk \u03a8,\n\u03b1k \u03b4\u03a8 A\n\nn\nX\n\nwhich can be transcribed directly as:\nXX\nk\n\nThe quantities\n\n\u0010\n\nl\n\n\u0011\n\nl=1\n\nbl \u03a8\n\u03b1l \u03b4\u03a8 A\n\n!\n\n\u22650\n\n(5.3)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nbk \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 A\nbl \u03a8 \u2265 0\n\u03b1k\u2217 \u03b1l \u03b4\u03a8 A\n\n(5.4)\n\nbk \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 A\nbl \u03a8 (k; l = 1, 2, ..., n) represents the correlation matrix of the\n\u03b4\u03a8 A\n\nset of variables Ak . It is obvious that\n\u0010\n\nbk \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 A\nbl \u03a8\n\u03b4\u03a8 A\n\n\u0011\u2217\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb\nb\n= \u03b4\u03a8 Al \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 Ak \u03a8\n\n(5.5)\n\ni.e. the correlation matrix is Hermitian. Equation (5.4) shows that the respective matrix\nis also non-negative definite. Then from the matrix algebra (see Korn and Korn, 1968) it\nresults\ndet\n\nh\u0010\n\nbk \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 A\nbl \u03a8\n\u03b4\u03a8 A\n\n\u0011i\n\n\u22650\n\n(5.6\n\nCR )\n\nwhere det [akl ] denotes the determinant with the elements akl . Here, and in the following\nnotations, the index CR added to the number of a formula shows the belonging of the\nrespective formula to a general family of similar correlation relations (CR).\nb1 = A\nb and A\nb2 = B\nb from Eq. (5.6) one obtains\nFor two operators A\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\nb\nb\nb \u03b4\u03a8 B\u03a8\nb \u03b4\u03a8 B\u03a8\nb\nb \u03b4\u03a8 A\u03a8\n\u2265 \u03b4\u03a8 A\u03a8,\n* \u03b4\u03a8 B\u03a8,\n\u03b4\u03a8 A\u03a8,\n\n2\n\n(5.7\n\nCR )\n\nIf the two operators satisfy the conditions\n\u0010\n\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nbk \u03a8, A\nbl \u03a8 = \u03a8, A\nbk A\nbl \u03a8 (k = 1, 2; l = 1, 2))\nA\n\nequation (5.6) gives directly\n\n15\n\n(5.8)\n\n\fD\n\n\u2206\u03a8 A * \u2206\u03a8 B \u2265\nWhen Eq.

So if\nfor an electron the spin state and the spin variables are described by the spinor \u03c7 (spin\nbj the alluded relations can be\nwave function) respectively by the matrices (operators) A\n16\n\n\fintroduced as follows. With the usual notations (see Bransden and Joachain, 1994) the\nexpected values are hAj i\u03c7 = \u03c7+ Aj \u03c7 while the correlations C\u03c7 (Aj Ae ) , dispersions D\u03c7 Aj ,\nand standard deviation \u2206\u03c7 Aj are given by\n\u0010\n\n\u0011+ \u0010\n\u0011\nb\nb\nC\u03c7 (Aj Al ) = \u03b4\u03c7 Aj \u03c7 * \u03b4\u03c7 Al \u03c7 ,\nD\u03c7 Aj = C\u03c7 (Aj Aj ) ,\nSimilarly to the orbital Eqs.\n\nbj = A\nbj \u2212 hAj i\n\u03b4\u03c7 A\n\u03c7\n\n\u2206\u03c7 Aj =\n\np\nD\u03c7 Aj\n\n(5.15)\n\n(5.3)-(5.6) it is easy to see that the spin-correlations\n\nC\u03c7 (Aj Al )satisfy the relation\ndet [C\u03c7 (Aj Al )] \u2265 0\n\n(5.16\n\nCR )\n\nFor two variables A1 = A and A2 = B, which satisfy conditions similar to (5.8), from (5.16)\none obtains\n\u2206\u03c7 A * \u2206\u03c7 B \u2265\n1\n\u2206\u03c7 A * \u2206\u03c7 B \u2265\n2\n\nD\n\nb \u03c7B\nb\n\u03b4\u03c7 A\u03b4\n\nE\n\n\u001ch\ni \u001d\nbB\nb\nA,\n\u2212\n\n(5.17CR )\n\n\u03c7\n\n(5.18\n\nCR )\n\n\u03c7\n\nEquations (5.18) and (5.16) are nothing but spin similars of orbital HR and of their generalizations given by Eqs. (5.13) respectively (5.6).\nTheoretical versions of HR (as well as their generalizations) imply, for the variables of the\nquantum microparticles, a lot of probabilistic parameters such as: expected/mean values,\ndispersions, standard deviations and correlations. This means that the respective variables\nhave stochastic (or random) characteristics. Then there follows directly the question: are\nthere similars of HR for other physical systems, different from quantum microparticles, which\nhave also variables with stochastic characteristics ? The answer to the mentioned questions\nis affirmative and it regards macroscopic systems studied in both classical and quantum\nstatistical physics. Here we shall illustrate the respective answer by taking over some ideas\nfrom our earlier works (Dumitru, 1974a, 1977, 1988, 1993).\n17\n\n\fFirstly let us refer to a macroscopic system, consisting of a large number of microparticles,\nconsidered in a thermodynamic equilibrium state. In the framework of classical (nonquantum) statistical physics such a system can be approached in terms of: (a) phenomenological\n(quasithermodynamic) fluctuations theory respectively (b) classical statistical mechanics. In\nthe mentioned approaches the state of the system is described (Landau and Lifchitz, 1984;\nZubarev, 1971; Ruppeiner, 1995) by the distribution function w = w(x). The variable x\ndenotes in the two cases: (a) the set of independent macroscopic variables of the system as\na whole, respectively (b) the phase space coordinates of the microparticles constituting the\nsystem. In both cases a specific variable A characterizing the system is a real stochastic\n(random) quantity with a continuous spectrum of values which depends on x, i.e. A = A(x).\nThe mean (or expected) value of A(x) is given by\nhAiw =\n\nZ\n\nA (x) w (x) d\u03a9x\n\n(5.19)\n\n\u03a9X\n\nwhere \u03a9x and d\u03a9x denote the accessible respectively infiniesimal domains in the x-space.\nThen, in the case of such a macroscopic system, for a set Aj (j = 1, 2, ..., n) of specific\nvariables, the thermal fluctuations are described by the correlations Cw (Aj Ae ), dispersions\nDw Aj and standard deviations \u2206w Aj given by\nCw (Aj Al ) = h\u03b4w Aj \u03b4w Al iw ,\nDw Aj = Cw (Aj Aj ) ,\n\n\u03b4w Aj = Aj \u2212 hAj iw\n\u2206w Aj =\n\np\nDw Aj\n\n(5.20 )\n\nBy relations similar to Eqs.(5.3)-(5.5) it is easy to see that the correlations h\u03b4w Aj \u03b4w Al i are\nthe elements of a non-negative real matrix. Then similarly with Eq. (5.6) one can write\n\u0003\n\u0002\ndet h\u03b4w Aj \u03b4w Al iw \u2265 0\n\n(5.21CR )\n\nParticularly for two variables A1 = A and A2 = B one obtains\nDw A * Dw B \u2265 h\u03b4w A * \u03b4w Bi2w\n18\n\n(5.22\n\nCR )\n\n\f\u2206w A * \u2206w B \u2265 |h\u03b4w A * \u03b4w Biw |\n\n(5.23\n\nCR )\n\nEquations (5.20)-(5.22) can be called thermal correlation relations. Some examples of such\nrelations are given below in Sec. VI. K. (see also Dumitru, 1974a, 1988, 1993).\nOne observes that Eqs. (5.23) and (5.21) are the macroscopic similars of microscopic HR\nand of their generalizations defined by Eqs. (2.3)/(4.8)/(5.13) respectively (5.6). Here it\nmust be noted that there are also other macroscopic similars of HR, namely relations from the\nframework of quantum statistical mechanics. Such relations can be obtained as follows: The\nstate respectively the specific variables of a macroscopic system in the mentioned framework\nare described by the statistical operator (density matrix) \u03c1b respectively by the operators\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb\nb\nAj (j = 1, 2, ..., n). With the expected values defined as hAj i\u03c1 = Tr Aj \u03c1b the macroscopic\ncorrelations C\u03c1 (Aj Ae ) , dispersions D\u03c1 Aj and standard deviations \u2206\u03c1 Aj are given by\nD\n\nbj * \u03b4\u03c1 A\nbl\nC\u03c1 (Aj Ae ) = \u03b4\u03c1 A\nD\u03c1 Aj = C\u03c1 (Aj Aj ) ,\n\nE\n\n\u03c1\n\nbj = A\nbj \u2212 hAj i\n\u03b4\u03c1 A\n\u03c1\n\n,\n\n\u2206\u03c1 Aj =\n\np\n\nD\u03c1 Aj\n\n(5.24)\n\nIn sufficiently general circumstances (among them the most important being some conditions\nsimilar with Eq.(5.8)) the quantities from Eqs.(5.24) satisfy the relations\ndet\n\n\u0014D\n\nbj \u03b4\u03c1 A\nbl\n\u03b4\u03c1 A\n\nE \u0015\n\u03c1\n\n\u22650\n\n(5.25)\n\n2\n\nD\u03c1 A * D\u03c1 B \u2265 h\u03b4\u03c1 A * \u03b4\u03c1 Bi\u03c1\n\n(5.26\n\n\u2206\u03c1 A * \u2206\u03c1 B \u2265 h\u03b4\u03c1 A * \u03b4\u03c1 Bi\u03c1\n\nCR )\n\n(5.27CR )\n\nb = A\nb1 , B\nb = A\nb2 . From Eq.(5.27) one obtains also the following truncated (less\nwith A\n\nrestrictive) relations\n\n1\n\u2206\u03c1 A * \u2206\u03c1 B \u2265\n2\n\n\u001ch\ni \u001d\nb \u03b4\u03c1 B\nb\n\u03b4\u03c1 A,\n+\n\n19\n\n(5.28CR )\n\u03c1\n\n\f\u001ch\ni \u001d\nb\nb\nA, B\n\n1\n\u2206\u03c1 A * \u2206\u03c1 B \u2265\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n(5.29\n\nCR )\n\n\u03c1\n\nThe latter relation is exactly a macroscopic similar of HR defined by Eqs. (2.3)/(4.8)/(5.13).\nThe above discussed relations are unitemporal in the sense that the implied probabilistic\nparameters (correlations, dispersions, standard deviations) of the stochastic variables Aj are\nconsidered for the same moment of time. But it easy to see that similar relations can be\nwritten if the mentioned parameters are taken into account for different time moments. So,\nif the orbital quantum state of a microparticle is described by the time t dependent wave\nfunction \u03a8 (q, t), instead of unitemporal Eq. (5.14) one can write the following bitemporal\nrelation:\n\u2206\u03a81 A * \u2206\u03a82 B \u2265\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb 1 , \u03b4\u03a82 B\u03a8\nb 2\n\u03b4\u03a81 A\u03a8\n\n(5.30)\n\nwhere \u03a81 = \u03a8 (q, t1 ) and \u03a82 = \u03a8 (q, t2 ) with t1 6= t2 .\n\nAnother well-known way of introducing the theoretical HR for orbital variables is based\non Fourier analysis as follows. Let be f (x) a continuous and quadratically integrable function\nin the range x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). Then its Fourier transforms fe(k) is defined by:\nIf |f (x)|2 and fe(k)\n\n2\n\n1\nfe(k) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nf (x) e\u2212ikx dx\n\n(5.31)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nare normalized to unity by using the Parseval formula one can write\nZ\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThen |f (x)|2 and fe(k)\n\n2\n\n|f (x)| dx =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n|f (k)|2 dk = 1\n\n(5.32)\n\ncan be interpreted as probability densities for the variables x\n\nrespectively k. Consequently the mean (expected) values of functions like A(x) or B(k) are\ngiven by\nhA (x)i =\n\nZ\n\nhB (k)i =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\nA (x) |f (x)|2 dx\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\nB (k) fe(k) dk\n20\n\n(5.33)\n\n(5.34)\n\n\fWith the above mentioned elements one can demonstrate (De Bruijn, 1967) the following\nrelation\n(x \u2212 a)2 * (k \u2212 b)2 \u2265\n\n1\n4\n\n(5.35)\n\nwith a and b as two arbitrary constants.\nOne observes that from Eq. (5.35) it results directly the HR defined by Eq. (2.2), for\nthe Cartesian coordinate x and momentum p. For such a result one must take f (x) as the\nwave function \u03a8 (x) and respectively a = hxi, b = hki and k = p/~.\nIf f (x) is periodic in x, with the period \u039b, or is defined in the range x \u2208 [x0 , \u039b] with the\nsame values on the boundaries, it satisfies the relation\nf (x0 ) = f (x0 + \u039b)\n\n(5.36)\n\nThen instead of fe(k) from Eq. (5.31) we have the Fourier coefficients\n1\nfen = \u221a\n\u039b\n\nZ\n\nx0 +\u039b\n\nf (x) e\u2212ikn x dx\n\n(5.37)\n\nx0\n\nwith kn = n * 2\u03c0/\u039b and n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...... Similarly with Eq. (5.33) we can take:\nZ\n\nx0 +\u039b\n\nx0\n\n2\n\n|f (x)| dx =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nfen\n\n2\n\n=1\n\n(5.38)\n\nThis means that |f (x)|2 can be interpreted as probability density for the continuous variable\nx while fen\n\n2\n\nsignify the probabilities associated with the discrete variable kn . In such a case\n\ninstead of Eqs. (5.33) and (5.34) one must write\nhA (x)i =\n\nhB (k)i =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nand instead of Eq. (5.35) one obtains\n\nx0 +\u039b\n\nx0\n\nA (x) |f (x)|2 dx\n2\u03c0\n\u039b\n\n(5.40)\n\n1\n|(\u039bf (x0 ) \u2212 1)|2\n4\n\n(5.41CR )\n\n2\n\nB (kn ) fen ,\n\n(x \u2212 a)2 * (k \u2212 b)2 =\n\n(5.39)\n\n21\n\nkn = n\n\n\fThis latter formula is applicable in some cases for the variables azimuthal angle \u03c6 and\nangular momentum Lz (see below the Sec. VI.F). In such cases f (x) is the periodic wave\nfunction \u03a8 (\u03c6)and respectively a = hxi , b = hki with x = \u03c6, k = Lz /~ and \u039b = 2\u03c0.\nWe end this section with a notification regarding the relations expressed by Eqs.: (5.6),\n(5.9), (5.11)-(5.14), (5.16)-(5.18), (5.21)-(5.23), (5.25)-(5.29), (5.30), (5.35) and (5.41). From\na mathematical viewpoint all the respective relations refer to variables with stochastic characteristics. Also, by their mathematical significances, they belong to the same family of\nsimilar formulae which can be called correlation relations (CR). That is why we added the\nindex CR to the numbers of all the respective relations.\n\nVI. DEFECTS OF T I H R\n\nWith the above mentioned facts now we can proceed to present the defects of TIHR.\nNote that the respective defects appear not as a systematized ensemble but rather as a\ndispersed set of (relatively) distinct cases. That is why our approach aims not at a precisely\nmotivated order of exposition. We mostly wish to show that taken together the set of the\nalluded defects irrefutably incriminate all the main elements of TIHR reviewed in Sec. II.\nThen our presentation includes the defects revealed in the following sub-sections:\n\nA. Groundlessness of the term \"uncertainty\"\n\nTrough the assertion P \u2212 2.8/A of TIHR the thought respectively theoretical quantities\n\u2206T E A and \u2206\u03a8 A from HR are termed measuring uncertainties. But the respective term\nappears as groundless if it is regarded comparatively with a lot of facts which we present\nhere.\nFirstly note that a minute examination of all thought experiments referred in connection\nwith Eq. (2.1) does not justify the mentioned term for one of the implied quantities \u2206T E A\nand \u2206T E B. So \u2206T E p (in the coordinate q -momentum p case) and \u2206T E E (in the time t energy E case) represent the jumps of the respective variable from an initial value (before\n22\n\n\fthe measurements) to a final value (after the measurements). Then it results that \u2206T E p and\n\u2206T E E can not be regarded as uncertainties (i.e. measuring parameters) with respect to the\nmeasured state which is the initial one. This because (Albertson, 1963): \"it seems essential\nto the notion of a measurements that it answer a question about the given situation existing\nbefore measurement. Whether the measurement leaves the measured system unchanged or\nbrings about a new and different state of that system is a second and independent question\".\nThe remaining quantities \u2206T E q and \u2206T E t from Eq. (2.1) are also in the situation of infringing the term \"measuring uncertainties\" in the sense attributed by TIHR. The respective\nsituation is generated by the same facts which will be presented below in the Sec. VI.B.\nAs regards the theoretical quantity \u2206\u03a8 A the following observations must be taken into\naccount. \u2206\u03a8 A depends only on the theoretical model (wave function \u03a8) of the considered microparticle but not on the characteristics of the measurements on the respective\nmicroparticle. Particularly note that the value of \u2206\u03a8 A can be modified only by changing\nthe microparticle state (i.e. its wave function \u03a8). Comparatively the measuring uncertainties can be modified by improving (or worsening) the performances of the experimental\ntechniques, even if the state of the measured microparticle remains unchanged.\nIn connection with the term \"uncertainty\" it is here the place to point out also the following remarks. In quantum mechanics a variable A is described by an adequate operator\nb which (Gudder, 1979) is a generalized stochastic (or random) quantity. The probabilistic\nA\n\n(stochastic) characteristics of the considered microparticle are incorporated in its wave function \u03a8. Then the expected value hAi\u03a8 and the standard deviation \u2206\u03a8 A appears as quantities\nwhich are exclusively of intrinsic nature for the respective microparticle. In such a situation\na measurements must consist of a statistical sampling but not of a solitary detection (determination). The respective sampling give an output-set of data on the recorder of the measuring\ninstrument. From the mentioned data one obtains the out-mean hAiOU T and out-deviation\nq\n\u2206OU T A =\n(A \u2212 hAiOU T )2 OU T . Then it results that in fact the measuring uncertainties\n\nmust be described by means of the differences hAiOU T \u2212 hAi\u03a8 and \u2206OU T A \u2212 \u2206\u03a8 A but not\nthrough the quantity \u2206\u03a8 A. (For other comments about the measurements regarded as here\n23\n\n\fsee below the Sec. IX).\nThe above mentioned facts prove the groundlessness of the term \"uncertainty\" in connection with the quantities \u2206T E A and \u2206\u03a8 A. But such a proof must be reported as a defect\nof TIHR.\nObservation: Sometimes, particularly in old texts, the quantities \u2206T E A and \u2206\u03a8 A are\ntermed \"indeterminacy\" of the quantum variable A. If such a term is viewed to denote the\n\"\u0144on-deterministic\" or \"random\" character of A it can be accepted for a natural interpretation of \u2206\u03a8 A. So the HR given by Eqs. (2.3)/(4.8)/(5.13) and their generalizations from\nEq. (5.6) appear to be proper for a denomination of \"indeterminacy relations\". But then\nit seems strange for the respective relations to be considered as \"crucial and fundamental\nformulae\" (as in TIHR conception). This because in non-quantum branches of probabilistic sciences an entirely similar \"indeterminacy relation\" is regarded only as a modest, and,\nby no means a fundamental formula. The alluded non-quantum \"indeterminacy relation\"\nexpresses simply the fact that the correlation coefficient (\u03b3AB = h\u03b4A * \u03b4Bi /\u2206A * \u2206B) takes\nvalues within the range [\u22121, 1] . (Schilling, 1972; Gellert et.al., 1975). One can see that such\na non-quantum relation is also Eq. (5.23).\n\nB. The nature and the performances of the referred experiments\n\nAs it was shown in Sec. II one of the major supports of TIHR is the reference to\nexperiments of \"thought\" nature. In such a reference, by means of \"thought motivations\",\nthe results (ideas) from known real experiments were transplanted in a new context. But\nsuch a transplantation seems to be inadequate for a true scientific acceptance, mainly if the\nnew context is practically and conceptually different from the old one. Also it is known that\nthe alluded acceptance must be founded only on two pieces of resistance: (a) concrete data\nfrom the real and specially designed experiments, and (b) correct rigorous mathematical\n(logical) reasonings.\nOne must add another less known observation about the nature of the experiments re-\n\n24\n\n\fferred by TIHR. Practically all the respective experiments are of \"thought\"-type and (Jammer, 1974, p.81) there are not known any real experiments capable of attesting (verifying)\nthe TIHR with a convincing accuracy.\nThe above presented facts reveal the uselessness respectively the incorrectness of the main\nelements P \u2212 2.6 and P \u2212 2.8 of TIHR. This means that by their existence the mentioned\nfacts evidentiate a defect of TIHR.\nThe thought experiments referred by TIHR operate with the limitative criteria included\nin P \u2212 4.1 and consequently with Eq. (2.1). But, as it was mentioned in Sec. V, today\nthere are known real experiments with super- resolutions which overstep the respective\ncriteria. Then it is easy to imagine some Super-Resolution-Thought-Experiments (SRTE)\nfor which instead of Eq. (2.1) is satisfied the SRTE relation given by Eq. (5.1). One observes\nnow directly that the existence of the respective SRTE relation incriminates the assertion\nP \u2212 2.12/A of TIHR. Such an incrimination must be reported also as a defect of TIHR.\nC. Inaccuracy of the referred theoretical formulae\n\nAmong the main supports of TIHR we find the theoretical Eqs. (2.3)/(4.8). But, mathematically, the respective formula is incompletely accurate because it fails if the condition\nexpressed by Eq. (5.8) is not satisfied. The complete accuracy is given by the more general\nEqs. (5.7) and (5.14).\nThe mentioned incompleteness seems to be regarded as entirely unnatural by the TIHR\nbz and\npartisans - e.g. when they consider the case of the variables angular momentum L\n\nazimuthal angle \u03c6 (see also below Sec. VI.F.). So, instead of the failing Eqs. (2.1)/(4.8),\n\nin order to preserve at any price the elements like P \u2212 2.12 and P \u2212 2.13, the respective\npartisans use a strange lot of unnaturally \"adjusted\" relations. But one can easily see that\nthe natural attitude in the alluded case is to refer to the Eqs. (5.7)/(5.14) or, equivalently,\nto Eq. (5.41). Of course that in the discussed case the respective equations degenerate\ninto trivial equality 0=0 which is evidently in contradiction with the elements P \u2212 2.12 and\n25\n\n\fP \u2212 2.13 of TIHR.\nThen one finds that one way or another TIHR is incompatible with the absolute accuracy\nof the referred theoretical equations: This fact constitutes a notable defect of TIHR\n\nD. Solitary variables\n\nBy P \u2212 2.10/A; M TIHR states that in a measurement for a solitary variable the quantity \u2206A can be taken as unlimitedly small. But if \u2206A is identified with \u2206\u03a8 A the respective\nquantity has a precisely defined value (dependent on the wave function \u03a8 describing the\nstate of the considered microparticle) which can not be diminished in a measurement. Then\nit results that P \u2212 2.10/A; M are incorrect. The respective results points another defect of\nTIHR.\n\nE. Commutable variables\n\nThe main idea of TIHR about the commutable variables is asserted in P \u2212 2.11/A; M.\nIt is based on the fact that in Eq. (2.3) the product of the corresponding quantities \u2206\u03a8 A\nand \u2206\u03a8 B has not a non-null lower bound. But besides the Eq. (2.3), the respective product\n\u001ch\ni \u001d\nb \u03b4\u03a8 B\nb\ncan be a non-null quantity.\n\u03b4\u03a8 A,\nsatisfies also the Eq. (5.12) where the term\n+\n\n\u03a8\n\nIn this respect we quote the following example (Dumitru, 1988):\n\nLet be a quantum microparticle moving in a two-dimensional potential well, characterized by the potential energy V =0 for 0 < x < a, 0 < y < b and V =\u221e otherwise.

(5.12) is satisfied with non-null quantity\nin the right-hand term. But such a result shows that the main idea of TIHR about the\ncommutable variables is doubtful. So we find another defect of TIHR.\n\nF. The Lz \u2212\u03c6 case\n\nThe situation of the variables Lz and \u03c6 (z-component of angular momentum and azimuthal angle) represents one of the most controverted case in connection with TIHR.\nFirstly, it was noted that the respective variables are canonically conjugated their quanbz = \u2212i~ \u2202 and \u03c6\ntum operators being L\nb = \u03c6 * . Then it was supposed that for Lz \u2212\u03c6 case\n\u2202\u03c6\n\nthe TIHR must be applicable similarly as for other pairs of conjugated variables-e.g. for px\n\nand x (Cartesian momentum and coordinate). Consequently it was expected to have the\nfollowing ordinary Lz \u2212\u03c6 theoretical HR\n\u2206\u03a8 Lz * \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 \u2265\n\n~\n2\n\n(6.4)\n\nAlso one knows attempts (Kompaneyets, 1966) for introducing a thought-experimental Lz \u2212\u03c6\nrelation of the form\n\u2206T E Lz * \u2206T E \u03c6 \u2248 ~\n27\n\n(6.5)\n\n\fwhich is similar with the px \u2212 x version of Eq. (2.1). But note that in fact Eq. (6.5) is only\nan unmasked conversion of Eq.. (2.1).\nSecondly, for the Lz \u2212\u03c6 case the inapplicability of TIHR in its usual form (presented\nin Sec. II) was remarked. Such remarks were signaled in a lot of debating works (Judge,\n1963; Judge and Lewis, 1963; Judge, 1964; Bouten et al, 1965; Evett and Mahmoud, 1965;\nKrauss, 1965, 1968; Carruthers and Nietto, 1968; Levy-Leblond, 1976; Harris and Strauss,\n1978; Hasse, 1980; Holevo, 1981; Yamada, 1982; Galitski et al., 1985). The mentioned\ninapplicability regards mainly from the HR Eq. (6.4) referred to some known systems such\nas: an atomic electron, a rotator or a bead shifting on a ring. Note that by their properties\nall the respective systems are \u03c6-circular (or azimuthally finite). This means that for them:\n(i) \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] , (ii) the states with \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = 2\u03c0 coincide and (iii) the states with \u03c6 & 0\nand \u03c6 . 2\u03c0 are closely adjacent. Moreover for the mentioned systems one considers only\nthe states which are nondegenerate in respect with Lz . This means that each of such state\ncorrespond to a distinct (eigen-) value of Lz . The alluded states are described by the wave\nfunctions:\n1\n\u03a8m (\u03c6) = \u221a eim\u03c6\n2\u03c0\n\n(m = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ......)\n\n(6.6)\n\n\u221a\nThen, for the demarcated states, one finds \u2206\u03a8 Lz = 0, \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 = \u03c0/ 3 and (6.4) gives the\nabsurd results 0 \u2265 ~/2. Such a result drives TIHR in a evident deadlock.\nFor avoiding the alluded deadlock the THR partisans advocated the following idea: In the\nLz \u2212\u03c6 case the theoretical HR must not have the ordinary form of Eq. (6.4) but an \"adjusted\nversion\", concordant with TIHR vision. Thus the following lot of \"adjusted Lz \u2212\u03c6 HR\" was\ninvented:\n\u2206\u03a8 Lz * \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6\n\u2265 0.16~\n1 \u2212 3 (\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6/\u03c0)2\n(\u2206\u03a8 Lz )2 * (\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6)2\n~2\n\u2265\n4\n1 \u2212 (\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6)2\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00131/2\n\u0012 \u00132\n9\n~2\n3\n~\u03c9\n2\n2\n2\n+\u03c9\n(\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6) \u2265\n\u2212 2\n(\u2206\u03a8 Lz ) +\n2\n2\n\u03c02\n\u03c0\n28\n\n(6.7)\n\n(6.8)\n\n(6.9)\n\n\f2\n\u2206\u03a8 Lz * \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6\n2 \u2265 ~\n3\n1 \u2212 3 (\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6/\u03c0)\n2\n\n2\n\n(\u2206\u03a8 Lz ) * (\u03b4\u03a8 f (\u03c6))\n\n\u03a8\n\nVmin\nVmax\n\n~2\n\u2265\n4\n\n\u001c\n\n\u0013\n\ndf\nd\u03c6\n\n(6.10)\n\u001d2\n\n(6.11)\n\n\u03a8\n\n~\n2\n\n(6.12)\n\n~\n|hE (\u03c6)i\u03a8 |\n2\n\n(6.13)\n\n~\n1 \u2212 2\u03c0 |\u03a8 (2\u03c0)|2\n2\n\n(6.14)\n\n\u2206\u03a8 Lz * \u2206\u03a8 \u03c61 \u2265\n\u2206\u03a8 Lz * \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 \u2265\n\u2206\u03a8 Lz * \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 \u2265\n\n\u0012\n\nIn Eq. (6.9) \u03c9 is a real nonnegative parameter. In Eq. (6.10) Vmin and Vmax represents\nR\u03c0\nthe minimum respectively the maximum values of V (\u03b8) = \u2212\u03c0 \u03b8 |\u03a8 (\u03c6 + \u03b8)|2 d\u03c6, where\n\u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] .

(6.12) \u03c61 = \u03c6 + 2\u03c0N, \u2206\u03a8 \u03c61 =\n\u0001\u00031/2\n\u0002 2 1\nand N, N1 =two arbitrary integer numbers with N 6= N1 .\n2\u03c0 12 + N 2 \u2212 N12 + N \u2212 N1\n\nIn Eq. (6.13) E(\u03c6)is a complicated expression of \u03c6.\n\nConnected with the Eqs. (6.7)-(6.14) and the afferent TIHR debates the following facts\nare easily observed. From a subjective view, in TIHR literature, none of the Eqs. (6.7)(6.14) is unanimously accepted as the true version for theoretical Lz \u2212\u03c6 HR. In a objective\nview the Eqs. (6.7)-(6.14) appear as a set of completely dissimilar formulae. This because\nthey are not mutually equivalent and each of them is applicable only in particular and\ndifferent \"circumstances\". Moreover it is doubtful that in the cases of Eqs. (6.7)-(6.13) the\nrespective \"circumstances\" should have in fact real physical significances. Another aspect\nfrom an objective view is the fact that the Eqs. (6.7)-(6.13) have no correct support in the\nnatural (non-adjusted) mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. Only Eq. (6.14)\nhas such a support through the Eq. (5.41). The alluded observations evince clearly the\npersistence of TIHR deadlock as regards the Lz \u2212\u03c6 case. But in spite of the mentioned\nevidence, in our days almost all of the publications seem to cultivate the belief that the\n29\n\n\fproblems of Lz \u2212\u03c6 case are solved by the adjusted Eqs. (6.7)-(6.14). In the TIHR literature\nthe mentioned belief is often associated with a more inciting opinion. According to the\nrespective opinion the ordinary theoretical HR expressed by Eq. (6.4) is incorrect for any\nphysical system and, consequently, the respective relation must be prohibited. Curiously,\nthrough the alluded association, TIHR partisans seem to ignore the thought experimental\nEq. (6.5). But note that the simple removal of the respective ignorance can not solve the\nTIHR deadlock regarding the Lz \u2212\u03c6 case. Moreover, such a removal is detrimental for TIHR\nbecause the Eq. (6.5) is only a conversion of Eq. (2.1) which is an unjustified relation (see\nSec. VI.B)\nAs regards the TIHR attitude towards the Eq. (6.4) there is another curious ignorance/omission. In the afferent literature it is omitted any discussion on the Lz - degenerate\nbZ and\nstates of the circular systems. Such a state is associated with a set of eigenvalue of L\nbZ . As example can be taken\nit is described by a linear superpositions of eigenfunctions of L\n\nthe state of a free rigid rotator with a given energy El = ~2 l(l + 1)/2J (l = orbital quantum\nnumber, J = moment of inertia). The respective state is described by the wave function\n\u03a8l (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\nl\nX\n\nCm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(6.15)\n\nm=\u2212l\n\nwhere Ylm (\u03b8) are the spherical functions, l and m denote the orbital respectively magnetic\nquantum numbers while Cm are arbitrary complex constants which satisfy the condition\nP\n2\nm |Cm | = 1. In respect with the wavefunction given in Eq. (6.15) for the operators\n\nbZ = \u2212i~ \u2202 and \u03c6\nL\nb = \u03c6 one obtains\n\u2202\u03c6\n(\u2206\u03c6 LZ )2 =\n\nX\nm\n\n|Cm |2 ~2 m2 \u2212\n\n(\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6)2 =\n\nXX\nm\n\n\u2212\n\n\"\nXX\nm\n\nm \u0301\n\nX\nm\n\n!2\n\n|Cm |2 ~m\n\n(6.16)\n\n\u0001\n\u2217\nCm\nCm \u0301 Ylm , \u03c62 Ylm \u0301\n\n\u2217\nCm\nCm \u0301 (Ylm , \u03c6Ylm \u0301)\n\nm \u0301\n\n30\n\n#2\n\n(6.17)\n\n\fWith the expressions \u2206\u03a8 LZ and \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 given by Eqs. (6.16) and (6.17) it is possible that the\nHR from Eq. (6.4) to be satisfied (For more details see below the discussions about the Eq.\n(8.3) in Sec. VIII). But surprisingly such a possibility was not examined by TIHR partisans\nwhich persevere to opine that Eq. (6.4) must be prohibited as incorrect in respect with any\nphysical situation. We think that such an attitude has to be considered as a defect of TIHR\ndoctrine.\nContrary to the TIHR partisans opinion about the HR given by Eq. (6.4) it is easy to\nsee (Dumitru, 1988, 1991), that the respective relation remains rigorously valid at least in\nthe case of one quantum system. The respective system is a Quantum Torsion Pendulum\n(QTP) oscillating around the z-axis. Such a QTP is completely analogous with the wellknown (recti)linear oscillator.\nThe states of the QTP are described by the wave functions:\n\u0012 \u00131/4\n\u03be2\n1\nJ\u03c9\np\n\u03a8n (\u03c6) = \u03a8n (\u03be) =\ne\u2212 2 Hn (\u03be)\n(6.18)\n\u221a\n\u03c0~\n2n n! \u03c0\np\nwith \u03be = \u03c6 * J\u03c9/~, \u03c6=azimuthal angle, J=moment of inertia, \u03c9=angular frequency,\n\u0010 \u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nn\n\u03be2\nn \u2212\u03be 2\nn\nn=0,1,2,...=the oscillation quantum number and Hn (\u03be) = (\u22121) e * d e /d\u03be are the\nHermite polynomials.. By its properties, QTP is \u03c6-torsional (\u03c6\u2212non-circular or azimuthally\ninfinite). This means that for it: (i) \u03c6 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) , (ii) the states with \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\ndo not coincide and (iii) the states with \u03c6 & 0 and \u03c6 . 2\u03c0 are not closely adjacent.\nbz = \u2212i~ \u2202\nIn the case of QTP for the variables Lz and \u03c6, described by the operators L\n\u2202\u03c6\n\nand \u03c6\nb = \u03c6*, one obtains the expression:\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n,\n\u2206\u03a8 Lz ~J\u03c9 n +\n2\n\n\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 =\n\ns\n\n~\nJ\u03c9\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nn+\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(6.19)\n\nWith these expressions one finds that for QTP the Lz \u2212\u03c6 theoretical HR is satisfied in the\nordinary/common form given by Eq. (6.4). So the existence of QTP example invalidate\nthe above mentioned opinion of TIHR partisans about the HR from Eq. (6.4).The alluded\ninvalidation makes even deeper the deadlock of TIHR with respect to the Lz \u2212\u03c6 case.\nAll the above mentioned deadlooks of TIHR-doctrine in connection with the pair Lz \u2212\u03c6\nmust be reported as indubitable defects of the respective doctrine.\n31\n\n\fG. The N-\u03a6 case\n\nAnother case which drived TIHR in deadlock is that of pair N-\u03a6 (number-phase) connected with the study of quantum oscillator. N represents the quantum oscillation number,\nb =b\ndescribed by the operator N\na+b\na (where b\na+ and b\na are the known ladder operators) while\n\n\u03a6 is taken as variable conjugated with N. Often, if the oscillator is considered as radiative,\n\nN and \u03a6 are regarded as number respectively phase of the radiated particles (photons or\nphonons). In the \u03a6 - representation we have\nh\ni\nb\nb\nN, \u03a6 = i\n\nb =i \u2202 , \u03a6\nb = \u03a6* ,\nN\n\u2202\u03a6\n\n\u2212\n\n(6.20)\n\nNote that in the mentioned representation the states under the considerations are \u03a6\u2212circular\n(in a similar way with the \u03c6-circular states discussed above in connection with the Lz \u2212\u03c6\ncase). The respective states are described by the wave functions\n1\n\u03a8N (\u03a6) = \u221a eiN \u03a6\n2\u03c0\n\n(N = 0, 1, 2, ........)\n\n(6.21)\n\nFor the N \u2212 \u03a6 case the TIHR doctrine requires that through the Eq. (2.3) one should have\nthe ordinary relation:\n\u2206\u03a8 N * \u2206\u03a8 \u03a6 \u2265\n\n1\n2\n\n(6.22)\n\nBut it is easy to see that this relation is incorrect because with (6.20) and (6.21) one obtains\n\u221a\n\u2206\u03a8 N = 0 and \u2206\u03a8 \u03a6 = \u03c0/ 3.\nThe incorrectness of the Eq. (6.22) derives TIHR in another deadlock. With the aim\nof avoiding the respective deadlock TIHR partisans promoted the idea to replace the Eq.\n(6.22) with some adjusted relations, concordant with TIHR doctrine. So in literature (Fain\nand Khanin, 1965; Carruthers and Nieto, 1968; Davydov, 1973; Opatrny, 1995; Lindner et\nal., 1996) were promoted a few adjusted relations such as:\n\u2206\u03a8 N * \u2206\u03a8 C \u2265\n\n1\nhSi\n2\n\n(6.23)\n\n\u2206\u03a8 N * \u2206\u03a8 S \u2265\n\n1\nhCi\n2\n\n(6.24)\n\n32\n\n\f\u0013 D E\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012D E\n~2\n3\n1\n2\nb\nb\n\u2212 L \u0301z \u2265\n1 \u2212 2 (\u2206\u03a8 \u03a6)\n(\u2206\u03a8 \u03a6) * (\u2206\u03a8 N \u0301) +\nN \u0301 +\n2\n4\n\u03c0\n\u03a8\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\n(6.25)\n\nThe new quantities appearing in Eqs.(6.23)-(6.25) are defined through the relations:\n\u0011\n1 \u0010b\nb\nb\nC=\nE\u2212 + E+ ,\n2\nb\u2212 (N + 1)\u22121/2 b\nE\na\n\nb IbL\nb \u0301z \u2212 1\nN \u0301=\n2\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010b\nb\nb\nS=\nE\u2212 \u2212 E+\n2i\nb+ = b\nE\na+ (N + 1)\u22121/2\n\n,\n\nb \u0301z = \u2212i~ \u2202\nL\n\u2202\u03a6\n\n,\n\n(6.26.a)\n\n(6.26.b)\n\n(6.27)\n\nIt is the place here to note the following observations. The replacement of the ordinary\nEq. (6.22) with the adjusted Eqs. (6.23)-(6.25) is only a redundant mathematical operation\nwithout any true utility for physics. This happens because for the interests of physics those\nof real utility are the observables N and \u03a6 but not the above mentioned adjusted quantities\nN \u0301, C or S. So if the interest of physics are connected on the particles (photons or phonons)\nradiated by quantum oscillators the real measuring instruments are counters respectively the\npolarizers. Such instruments measure directly N and \u03a6 but not N \u0301, C or S. So the measuring\nuncertainties, appealed by TIHR as corner-stone pieces, must regard N and \u03a6 but not N \u0301, C\nor S.\nThe above noted observations show that the relations like Eqs. (6.23)-(6.24) (or other\nadjusted formulae) do not solve the nonconformity of the pair N \u2212 \u03a6 with TIHR doctrine.\nThe respective nonconformity remains an open question which can not be solved by means\nof inner elements of TIHR. This means that the N \u2212 \u03a6 case appears as an irrefutable defect\nof TIHR.\n\nH. The energy - time case\n\nThe pair energy E - time t was and still is the subject of many debates in the literature\n(Aharonov and Bohm, 1961, 1964; Fock, 1962; Alcook, 1969; Bunge, 1970; Fujivara, 1970;\n\n33\n\n\fSurdin, 1973; Kijovski, 1974; Bauer and Mello, 1978; Voronstov, 1981; Kobe and AquileraNavaro, 1994). The respective debates originate in the following facts:\nOn the one hand E and t are considered as (canonically) conjugated variables whoose\nh\ni\nb = i~ \u2202 and b\nb b\nordinary operators E\nt\n=\nt*\nsatisfy\nthe\ncommutation\nrelation\nE,\nt\n= i~. Then\n\u2202t\n\nfor these variables the theoretical HR expressed by Eq. (2.3) should take the ordinary form\n\u2206\u03a8 E * \u2206\u03a8 t \u2265\n\n~\n2\n\n(6.28)\n\nOn the other hand as t is not a random but a deterministic variable \u2206\u03a8 t \u2261 0 for any\nb\nstate (wave function). Moreover the energy is described by the Hamiltonian operator H\n\nand then \u2206\u03a8 E = \u2206\u03a8 H. Or \u2206\u03a8 H is a null quantity (in the case of stationary states which\nb or a non-null but finite quantity in the case of nonstationary\nare pure eigenstates of H)\n\nb Then one finds that\nstates or of stationary ones which are mixtures of eigenstates of H).\n\nin fact for the pair E \u2212 t the theoretical HR given by Eqs. (2.3)/(6.28) degenerate into\n\nthe absurd result 0 \u2265 (~/2) . With such a result the E \u2212 t case radically deviates from the\nTIHR stipulations. For avoiding the respective deviation the TIHR partisans invented a lot\nof adjusted E \u2212 t relations destined to replace Eq. (6.28) and to remain concordant with\nthe alluded stipulations. More of the mentioned relations have the following generic form:\n\u2206v E * \u2206v t \u2265\n\n~\n2\n\n(6.29)\n\nwhere \u2206v E and \u2206v t have various significances such as: (i) \u22061 E = the line breadth characterizing the decay of an excited quantum state and \u22061 t = the duration life of the respective state\n(ii) \u22062 E = ~\u22062 \u03c9 = the energetic width of a wave packet and \u22062 t = temporal width of the\npacket (while Eq. (6.29) is introduced by means of Eq.(5.35) with x = t and k = \u03c9 = E/~).\n(iii) \u22063 E = \u2206\u03a8 H and \u22063 t = \u2206\u03a8 A * (d hAi\u03a8 /dt)\u22121 with A as an arbitrary variable.\nOther substitutions of Eq.

(6.28) the following major\nshortcomings must be notified: (i) The Eqs. (6.29)-(6.32) do not result from the standard\nmathematical procedures specific for the true theoretical HR (as presented in sections III,\nIV, and V), (ii) The variety of significances for \u2206v E and \u2206v t from Eq. (6.29) still generates\npersistent disputes among TIHR partisans, (iii) None of the substitution alternatives for Eq.\n(6.28) was ratified until now by natural and credible arguments.\nThe above notifications together with the presented observations about Eq. (6.28) clearly\ndisclose an important and persistent defect of TIHR.\n\nI. Bitemporal relations\n\nThe bitemporal relation given by Eq. (5.30) facilitates the detection of another defect of\nTIHR. If in the respective relation one takes |t2 \u2212 t1 | \u2192 \u221e in the TIHR vision the quantities\n\u2206\u03a81 A and \u2206\u03a82 B refer to two variables A and B each of them considered as solitary. In\nsuch a case the TIHR assertion P \u2212 2.10/A claims that both \u2206\u03a81 A and \u2206\u03a82 B should be\nboundlessly small quantities. But from Eq. (5.30) one can see that such a claim is refuted\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb 1 , \u03b4\u03a82 A\u03a8\nb 2 6= 0. An example of such a case can be provided as\nin the cases when \u03b4\u03a81 A\u03a8\n\nfollows.\n\nFor a QTP the time-dependent wave functions describing its states are\n\u03a8nt = \u03a8n (\u03be, t) = exp\n\n\u0012\n\n35\n\n\u0013\n\u2212iEn\nt \u03a8n (\u03be)\n~\n\n(6.33)\n\n\fwhere \u03a8n (\u03be)are given by Eq.

(5.30)/(6.34) must be notified as a clear defect of TIHR. Various attempts (LevlyLeblond 1967; Ghanapragasam and Srinivas, 1979) of extrapolating TIHR vision onto the\nrelations of Eq. (5.30) type seem to us to be without any real physical foundation.\n\nJ. Multivariable relations\n\nIn Sec. V we have shown that the multivariable relations from Eqs.(5.6) belong to the\nsame family of theoretical formulae as the primary HR given by Eqs. (2.2)/(2.3). For an\nexample of such a multivariable relation we can consider the QTP described by (6.18) and\nthe following set of three variables: A1 = Lz , A2 = \u03c6 and A3 = T = L2z /2J =the kinetic\nenergy. Then from Eq. (5.6) one obtains:\n\u0010\n\u00112\nb\nb \u03b4\u03a8 T \u03a8 +\n(\u2206\u03a8 Lz ) * (\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6) * (\u2206\u03a8 T ) \u2265 (\u2206\u03a8 Lz ) * \u03b4\u03a8 \u03c6\u03a8,\n2\n\n+ (\u2206\u03a8 \u03c6)2 *\n\u22122 Re\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u00112\nbz \u03a8\nbz \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 \u03c6\u03a8\n\u03b4\u03a8 Tb\u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 L\n+ (\u2206\u03a8 T )2 * \u03b4\u03a8 L\nb\n\u2212\n\nn\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011o\nbz \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 \u03c6\u03a8\nbz\n\u03b4\u03a8 L\nb\n* \u03b4\u03a8 \u03c6\u03a8,\nb \u03b4\u03a8 Tb\u03a8 * \u03b4\u03a8 Tb\u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 L\n\nwhere Re f = real part of f, \u2206\u03a8 Lz respectively \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 are given by Eq.(6.19) and\n36\n\n(6.37)\n\n\f~\u03c9\n\u2206\u03a8 T =\n2\n\nr\n\n\u0010\n\nn2 + n + 1\n,\n2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b4\u03a8 \u03c6,\nb \u03b4\u03a8 Tb\u03a8 = 0,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n~\nb\n\u03b4\u03a8 Lz \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 \u03c6\u03a8\nb\n= \u2212i\n2\n\n\u0011\nbz \u03a8 = 0\n\u03b4\u03a8 Tb\u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 L\n\n(6.38)\n\nThe alluded relationship of the multivariable Eqs. (5.6), (6.37) with the HR from Eqs.\n(2.9)/(2.10) naturally requires an argued answer to the question: In what rapports must\nbe the (physical) interpretation of the respective relations with TIHR? The question was\napproached (Synge, 1971) from a viewpoint of extrapolating TIHR vision. In the spirit\nof such a view there was promoted the idea that a 3-variable relation of Eq. (5.6) type\n(obtained by Synge on a different way) must be interpreted as describing a fundamental\ninterconnection among the uncertainties characterizing the simultaneous measurements for\nthe corresponding variables. Other scientists (Dodonov and Man'ko, 1987), who investigate\nfrom a mathematical viewpoint the generalizations of HR given by Eq. (2.2)/(2.3), have\ndeliberately (and declaratively) omitted any approach of the above mentioned question.\nA careful examination of the facts shows that the above mentioned extrapolation of\nTIHR is unjustifiable at least because of the following reasons: (i) It cannot be sustained by\nreal (nonfictitious) arguments regarding the true characteristics of the measurements, (ii) As\nit was pointed out in Sec. VI.A the theoretical quantities implied in Eqs. (5.6) and (6.37)\nbj \u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 Ae \u03a8)) have not significance of measuring uncertainties. Then it\n(like \u2206\u03a8 Aj or (\u03b4\u03a8 A\n\nresults that, although mathematically the multivariable relations are closely related with\nHR, they cannot be interpreted in a manner consonant with TIHR. But such a result must\nbe notified as another defect of TIHR regarded as a comprehensive doctrine.\n\nK. Thermal relations\n\nTIHR was promoted in connection with the quantum HR given by Eqs. (2.2)/(2.3).\nBut we have shown that, mathematically, the respective HR are completely similar with\nthe thermal relations from Eqs. (5.21)-(5.23). Firstly, we shall present here some concrete\nexamples of such thermal relations.\n37\n\n\fSo from the phenomenological (quasithermodynamic) theory of fluctuations we can quote\n(Dumitru, 1974 a, 1988) the following P-V (pressure-volume) formula\n\u2206w V * \u2206w P \u2265 |h\u03b4w V \u03b4\u03c9 P iw |\n\n(6.39)\n\nwhere\n\u2206w V =\n\ns\n\n\u2212kT\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202V\n\u2202p\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u2206w P =\n\nT\n\ns\n\n\u2212kT\n\nh\u03b4w V \u03b4w P iw = \u2212kT\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202p\n\u2202V\n\n\u0013\n\nS\n\n(6.40)\n\nwith A = hAiw , k = Boltzmann's constant and S = entropy.\nAlso we can quote a formula of Eq. (5.23) type from classical statistical physics. For\nthis let us consider an ideal gas situated in a cylindrical recipient of height b on the Earth\nsurface. The gas is supposed to be in a thermodynamical equilibrium state described by\nthe canonical distribution w \u223c exp {\u2212H/kT }, with H = the Hamiltonian of the molecules.\nIf the molecules are considered as identic point particles, we can take H of the form H =\nPN\nP3N 2\ni=1 mgzi (N, pi and zi represent respectively the number, linear momenta\ni=1 (pi /2m) +\n\nand altitude of the molecules; m denotes the mass of a molecule and g is the gravitational\nacceleration). As stochastic variables for the gas regarded as a statistical system we consider\n\nA = H = Hamiltonian and B = Zc = the altitude of the centre of mass. For such variables\nEq. (5.23) transcribes as\n\u2206w H * \u2206w Zc \u2265 |h\u03b4w H\u03b4w Zc iw | *\n\n(6.41)\n\nThe terms from this relation are given by\n2\n\n(\u2206w H) = k\u03bdRT\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n5\n\u2212 a2 f (a)\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nb2 1\n\u2212 f (a)\n(\u2206w Zc ) = k\n\u03bdR a2\n\u0002\n\u0003\nh\u03b4w H * \u03b4Zc i = kT b (ea \u2212 1)\u22121 \u2212 f (a)\n38\n\n(6.42a)\n\n(6.42b)\n\n(6.42c)\n\n\fwhere \u03bd = number of moles, f (a) = ea (ea \u2212 1)\u22122 and a = (\u03bcgb/RT )with \u03bc = molar mass\nof the gas, R = universal gas constant.\nAnother nontrivial exemplification of Eq. (5.22) is given by the early known F\u0171rth \u0301s\nformula from the theory of Brownian motion (F\u0171rth, 1933). In the respective formula A = x\nand B = v i.e. the coordinate and velocity of a Brownian particle, whereas h\u03b4w A\u03b4w Biw =\nh\u03b4w x * \u03b4w viw = D diffusion coefficient of the particle. Then the F\u0171rth \u0301s formula is:\n\u2206w x * \u2206w v > D\n\n(6.43)\n\nNow let us return to the mentioned mathematical similarity between thermal relations given\nby Eqs. (5.21)-(5.23), (6.39), (6.41), (6.43) and HR from Eqs. (2.2)/(2.3). The respective\nsimilarity suggests an investigation of the possible connections between the interpretation of\nthe alluded thermal relations respectively the TIHR. Such an investigation was approached\nby some traditionalist-scientists (Frank-Kamenetsky, 1940; Bohm, 1957; Rosenfeld, 1961\nand 1962; Terletsky, 1974). Mainly, they promoted the idea that the mentioned thermal\nrelations must be interpreted in terms of a macroscopic complementarity. Consequently, by\nextrapolation of the TIHR statements P \u2212 2.15 and P \u2212 2.16, in Eq. (5.23) the variables\nA and B must be regarded as complementary (i.e. mutually exclusive) while \u2206w A and\n\u2206w B have to be interpreted as uncertainties in simultaneous measurements. The mentioned\ntraditionalist idea was partially reviewed from various perspectives (Shaposhnikov, 1947;\nBazarov, 1979; Uffink and van Lith, 1999). But in the alluded reviews there are not pointed\nout explicitely the facts that the quantities like DwA and DwB describe the thermal fluctuations respectively that such fluctuations are inrinsic properties of tehe thermodynamic\nsystems.\nOur opinion is that the alluded idea of macroscopic complementarity must be rejected\ndue to the following reasons: (i) The quantity \u2206w A is not a measuring uncertainty but a\nparameter (standard deviation) characterizing the thermal fluctuations. (ii) The value of\n\u2206w A can be modified only by changing the inner state (i.e. the distribution function w)\nof the considered system but not by means of improvements of measuring precision. (iii)\n39\n\n\fRegarded as fluctuation parameter \u2206w A can be measured without restriction of principle.\nSo in noise spectroscopy (Weissmann, 1981) it is possible to measure even the \"constitutive\"\n(i.e. spectral) components of \u2206w A. (iv) In classical physics the variables characterizing a\nmacroscopic system are not mutually exclusive (i.e. complementary), (v) The true conception about the macroscopic measurements does not include any reference to the mutual\nunavoidableness of simultan uncertainties for two (or more) variables.\nThe above mentioned reasons clearly guide us to the following conclusion. In spite of\nthe mathematical similarity between HR and the discussed thermal relations, TIHR can\nnot be extended (by similitude) to the interpretation of the respective relations. But as the\nmentioned mathematical similarity is of a conceptually fundamental nature the concluded\ninextensibility must be notified as a true defect of TIHR.\n\nL. The so-called macroscopic operators\n\nControversies about TIHR also included several discussions regarding the macroscopic\nrelation given by Eq. (5.29) (see Jancel, 1973 and references). The respective discussions\nwere generated by the following conflicting findings: (i) On the one hand the respective\nrelation appears within quantum theory and, mathematically, it is completely similar with\nHR expressed by Eqs. (2.2)-(2.3). Then by extrapolating TIHR the Eq. (5.29) should be\ninterpreted as an interconnection of the macroscopic uncertainties \u2206\u03c1 A and \u2206\u03c1 B regarding\nthe simultaneous measurements of the variables A and B afferent to a macroscopic system.\n(ii) On the other hand, according to P \u2212 2.4, TIHR operates with the hypothesis that\na macroscopic variable can be measured without any uncertainty (i.e. with unbounded accuracy), irrespective of the fact that it is measured solitary or simultaneously with other\nvariable. Then, of course, it is useless to speak of an interconnection between the uncertainties of two macroscopic variables-even if, in theoretical framework, they are described\nby quantum statistical operators.\nTo elude the mentioned conflict the TIHR partisans promoted the strange idea to abro-\n\n40\n\n\fgate the Eq. (5.29) and to replace it by an adjusted macroscopic formula concordant with\nb and B\nb from Eq. (5.29) were substiTIHR vision. With this aim, the common operators A\n\nbM and B\nbM which (in any representation?)\ntuted by the so-called \"macroscopic operators\" A\nh\ni\nbM , B\nbM\ncan be pictured as quasi-diagonal matrices. Then one supposes that A\n= 0 and\n\u2212\n\ninstead of Eq. (5.29) one obtains\n\n\u2206\u03c1 AM * \u2206\u03c1 BM \u2265 0\n\n(6.44)\n\nIn this relation TIHR partisans view the fact that, simultaneously, the uncertainties \u2206\u03c1 A\nand \u2206\u03c1 B can be arbitrarily small. Such a view is concordant with the main concept of\nTIHR. Today many scientists believe that the adjusted Eq. (6.44) solves all the troubles of\nTIHR generated by the Eq. (5.29).\nIt is easy to remark that the mentioned belief proves to be unfounded if one takes into\naccount the following observations:\n(i) Equation (5.29) can not be abrogated unless the entire mathematical apparatus of\nquantum statistical physics is abrogated too. More exactly, the substitution of the common\nbM and B\nbM with macroscopic operators A\nbM and B\nbM is a useless invention. This\noperators A\n\nbecause in the practical domain of quantum statistical physics (see for example Tyablikov,\n1975) the common operators but not the macroscopic ones are used.\n\n(ii) The above mentioned substitution of operators does not metamorphose automatically\nEq. (5.29) into Eq. (6.44). This because, if two operators are quasi-diagonal (in the sense\nrequired by the TIHR partisans) they can be non-commutable. As an example in this\nsense we refer to a macroscopic system formed by a large number N of independent 12 -spins\n(Dumitru, 1988, 1989). The hinted macroscopic variables are components Mj (j = x, y, z)of\n\u2212\n\u2192\nthe magnetization M . The corresponding operators are\n\u03b3~ (2)\n\u03b3~ (N )\n(1)\nbj = M\ncj = \u03b3~ \u03c3\nA\nbj \u2295\n\u03c3\nbj \u2295 ...... \u2295\n\u03c3\nb\n2\n2\n2 j\n\n(6.45)\n\n(n)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = magneto-mechanical factor, \u03c3\nbj = Pauli matrices associated with the \"n-th\" spin\n\n(microparticle). One can see that the operators defined by Eqs. (6.45) are quasidiagonal\n41\n\n\fin the sense required for \"macroscopic operators\", but they are not commutable among\nh\ni\ncx , M\ncy = i~\u03b3 M\ncz . Consequently one can say that by the\nthem, as we have for example M\nmentioned substitution of operators the Eq. (5.29) is transposed in fact not in (6.44) but\ninto the formula\n\u2206\u03c1 AM * \u2206\u03c1 BM \u2265\n\n\u001ch\n\nBut such a formula is not helpful for TIHR if\ndefined by Eqs. (6.45).\n\nbM , B\nbM\nA\n\ni \u001d\n\u2212\n\n(6.46)\n\n\u03c1\n\nDh\niE\nbM , B\nbM\nA\n6= 0, as in the case of operators\n\u03c1\n\n(iii) The alluded substitution of operators does not solve the troubles of TIHR even if\nthe macroscopic operators are commutable. This because Eq. (5.29) is only a truncated\nversion of the more general Eq. (5.27). Then by the mentioned substitution, in fact, one\nmust consider the methamorphosis of Eq. (5.27) which gives\n\u2206\u03c1 AM * \u2206\u03c1 BM \u2265\n\nD\nE\nbM * \u03b4\u03c1 B\nbM\n\u03b4\u03c1 A\n\n(6.47)\n\n\u03c1\n\nh\ni\nD\nE\nb\nb\nb\nb\nIn this formula, if AM , BM = 0, one obtains \u2206\u03c1 AM * \u2206\u03c1 BM =\n\u03c1\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u001ch\ni \u001d\nbM , \u03b4\u03c1 B\nbM\n\u03b4\u03c1 A\n+\n\n\u03c1\n\ni.e. a quantity which can have a non-null value. Then it results that the macroscopic product\n\u03b4\u03c1 AM * \u03b4\u03c1 BM can have a non-null lower bound. But such a result opposes to the agreements\nof TIHR.\nSo we conclude that in fact the mentioned macroscopic operators cannot solve the TIHR\ndeficiencies connected with the Eq. (5.29). This means that the respective deficiencies\nremain unsolved and they must be reported as another insurmountable defect of TIHR.\n\nVII. INDUBITABLE FAILURE OF TIHR\n\nA mindful examination of all the details of the facts discussed in the previous section\nguide us to the following remarks:\nP \u2212 7.1 : Taken together, in an ensemble, the above presented defects incriminate and\ninvalidate each of the main elements of TIHR.N\n42\n\n\fP \u2212 7.2 : The mentioned defects are insurmountable for the TIHR doctrine, because\nthey cannot be avoided or refuted by means of credible arguments from the framework of\nthe respective doctrine.N\nThe two remarks reveal directly the indubitable failure of TIHR which now appears as\nan unjustified doctrine. Then the sole reasonable attitude is to abandon TIHR and, as a first\nurgency, to search the genuine significance (interpretation) of the HR. As second urgency,\nprobably, it is necessary a re-evaluation of those problems in which, by its implications,\nTIHR persists as a source of misconceptions and confusions.\n\nVIII. THE GENUINE SIGNIFICANCE OF H R\n\nA veritable search regarding the genuine significance of HR must be founded on the true\nmeaning of the elements implied in the introduction of the respective relations. Then we\nhave to take into account the following considerations.\nFirstly, we opine that thought-experimental HR of the type given by Eq. (2.1) must be\nomitted from discussions. This because, as it was pointed out (see Sec. VI.B and comments\nabout the Eq. (5.1)), such a type of relations has a circumstantial character dependent on\nthe performances of the supposed measuring-experiment. Also in the respective relations\nthe involved variables are not regarded as stochastic quantities such are the true quantum\nvariables. So the equations of (2.1) - type have not a noticeable importance for the conceptual\nfoundation of quantum mechanics. Moreover the usages of such relations in various pseudodemonstration (Tarasov, 1980) have not a real scientific value. That is why we opine that\nthe thought-experimental HR of the type given by Eq. (2.1) must be completely excluded\nfrom physics.\nWe resume the above opinions under the following point:\nP \u2212 8.1: The thought-experimental HR like Eq. (2.1) must be disregarded being fictitious formulae without a true physical significance.N\nAs regard the theoretical HR of the kind illustrated by Eqs. (2.2)/(2.3) the situation is\n\n43\n\n\fcompletely different. The respective HR are mathematically justified for precisely defined\nconditions within the theoretical framework of quantum mechanics. This means that the\nphysical significance (interpretation) of the theoretical HR is a question of notifiable importance. Now note that the mentioned HR belong to the large family of correlation relations\nreviewed in Sec. V. This fact suggests that the genuine significance (interpretation) of the\ntheoretical HR must be completely similar with that of the mentioned correlation relations.\nWe opine that the alluded suggestion must be taken into account with maximum consideration. Then, firstly, we remark that all of the mentioned correlation relations refer to the\nvariables with stochastic characteristics. Such variables are specific both for quantum and\nnon-quantum (i.e. classical) physical systems. Secondly, let us regard the quantities like\n\u2206w A or h\u03b4w A\u03b4w Biw which appear in the corresponding correlation relations from classical\nstatistical physics. In our days science the respective quantities are unanimously interpreted\nas fluctuation parameters of the considered variables A and B. Also it is clearly accepted the\nfact that the respective parameters describe intrinsic properties of the viewed systems but\nnot some characteristics (i.e. uncertainties) of the measurements on the respective properties. In this sense in some scientific domains, such as noise spectroscopy (Weissman, 1981),\nthe evaluation of the quantities like \u2206w A is regarded as a tool for investigation of the intrinsic properties of the physical systems. In classical conception the description of the intrinsic\nproperties of the physical systems is supposed to be not amalgamated with elements regarding the measuring uncertainties. The alluded description is made, in terms of corresponding\nphysical variables, within the framework of known chapters of classical physics (i.e. mechanics, electrodynamics, optics, thermodynamics and statistical physics). For the mentioned\nvariables, when it is the case, the description approaches also the fluctuations characteristics.\nOtherwise, in classical conception the measuring uncertainties /errors are studied within the\nframework of error analysis. Note that the respective analysis is a scientific branch which\nis independent and additional with respect to the mentioned chapters of physics (Worthing\nand Geffner, 1955).\nThe above mentioned aspects about the classical quantities \u2206w A and h\u03b4w A\u03b4w Biw must\n44\n\n\fbe taken into account for the specification of the genuine significance (interpretation) of the\nquantum quantities \u2206\u03a8 A and h\u03b4\u03a8 A\u03b4\u03a8 Bi\u03a8 , as well as of the theoretical HR. We think that\nthe respective specification can be structured through the following points:\nP \u2212 8.2 : The quantum variables (operators) must be regarded as stochastic quantities\nwhich admit fluctuations.N\nP \u2212 8.3 : Acording to the usual quantum mechanics, the time is not a stochastic variable\nbut a deterministic quantity which does not admit fluctuations.N\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u001ch\ni \u001d\nb\nb\nb\nb\nP \u2212 8.4 : The theoretical quantities \u2206\u03a8 A, \u2206\u03a8 B, \u03b4\u03a8 A\u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8 B\u03a8 or\nA, B\nmust\n\u2212\n\n\u03a8\n\nbe interpreted as parameters referring to the fluctuations regarded as intrinsic properties of\nquantum microparticles.N\nP \u2212 8.5 : The theoretical HR of the kind illustrated by Eqs (2.2)/(2.3) must be considered through their accurate and complete forms presented in Sec.V. In such forms\nthey have to be interpreted as fluctuation formulae regarding intrinsic characteristics of\nmicroparticles.N\nP \u2212 8.6 : The quantities mentioned in P \u2212 8.4 as well as the theoretical HR have no\nconnection with the description of measuring uncertainties.N\nP \u2212 8.7 : The description of measurements, characteristics (e.g. of measuring uncertainties) for quantum microparticles must be made in the frame of a scientific branch which is\nindependent and additional with respect to the usual quantum mechanics.N\nA persuasive argumentation of these points results directly form the above presented\nconsiderations. For P \u2212 8.4 and P \u2212 8.6 the respective argumentation can be improved\nby the following observations: (i) the values of the quantities discussed in P \u2212 8.4 depend\n(through the wave function \u03a8) only on the considered microparticle state, (ii) the respective\nvalues are independent of the measuring uncertainties which, for the same measured state,\ncan be modified (by changing the accuracy of experimental instruments).\nThe above presented points P \u2212 8.1 - P \u2212 8.6 can be regarded as the main elements\nof a genuine reinterpretation of HR. It is easy to see that the respective reinterpretation is\ncompletely concordant with the working procedures of usual quantum mechanics (which, of\n45\n\n\fcourse, include the theoretical HR as particular formulae).\nThe mentioned reinterpretation assures a vision where all the defects of TIHR presented\nin Sec. VI. A -VI. L are eliminated as inadequate and unfounded statements. So the\ndefect discussed in Sec. VI. A. loses any sense if one takes into account P \u2212 8.1, P \u2212 8.4\nand P \u2212 8.6. Also the defect revealed in Sec. VI. B has no value if we accept P \u2212 8.1.\nThe facts presented in Sec. VI. C can be elucidated by considering P \u2212 8.6. For the case\nof solitary variables approached in Sec. VI. D a pertinent answer is given by P \u2212 8.4\nand P \u2212 8.6. The same points P \u2212 8.4 and P \u2212 8.6 offer a natural vision on the case of\ncommutable variables approached in Sec.VI. E.\nThe cases of the pairs LZ \u2212 \u03c6 and N \u2212 \u03a6 discussed in Secs. VI. F and VI. G can be\nbrought in concordance with the proposed reinterpretation of HR as follows.\nIn the situations described by the wave functions given by Eqs.(6.6) and (6.21) the\nconditions expressed by Eqs. (5.8) are not satisfied. Then, according to P \u2212 8.5, in such\nsituations the discussions must refer to the complete and general correlation relations given\nby Eqs. (5.7) or (5.14) but not to the restrictive formulae like Eqs. (2.3)/(5.13)/(6.4).\nNote that, from a general perspective, the situations described by the wave functions \u03a8\nnoted in Eqs. (6.6) or (6.21) refer to the cases which regard the uni-variable eigenstates.\nb = a\u03c8 and B\u03c8\nb 6= b\u03c8 respectively\nIn such a state for two variables A and B we have A\u03c8\n\u001ch\ni \u001d\nbB\nb\n\u2206\u03c8 A = 0 and 0 < \u2206\u03c8 B 6= \u221e. But if\nA,\n\u03a8 6= 0 for the pair A \u2212 B the HR from\n\u2212\n\nEq. (2.3) and the related TIHR assertions are not applicable. It must be reminded that an\n\nearly modest notification (Davidson, 1965) of the TIHR shortcomings in respect with the\nuni-variable eigenstates seem to be ignored by the TIHR partisans.\nNow we can see that the alluded inapplicability of Eq. (2.3) is generated by the fact that\nfor the mentioned uni-variable eigenstates the Eqs. (5.8) are not satisfied. This because if\nfor such states Eqs. (5.8) are satisfied we must admit the following row of relations.\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nb\nb B\u03a8\nb\nbB\u03a8\nb\na < B >\u03a8 = a \u03a8, B\u03a8\n= A\u03a8,\n= \u03a8, A\n=\n46\n\n\f=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 \u0010\nh\ni\n\u0011 \u001ch\ni \u001d\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\u03a8, AB \u03a8 + \u03a8, B A\u03a8 = AB\n+ < B >\u03a8 *a\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\ni.e. the absurd result a < B >\u03a8 =\n\n(8.1)\n\n\u03a8\n\nDh\ni E\nbB\nb\n+ a hBi\u03a8 with [A, B]\u2212\nA,\n\u03a8\n\n\u03a8\n\n6= 0.\n\nAdd here the fact that for the discussed states instead of Eq. (2.3) the more general Eq.\n(5.7) remain valid (in the trivial form 0 = 0).\nIt is quite evidently that the situations of uni-variable eigenstates come into the normality\nif \u2206\u03a8 A and \u2206\u03a8 B are regarded as parameters which describe the quantum fluctuations.\nThen in such situations A and B have respectively have not fluctuations (i.e. stochastic\ncharacteristics).\nThe situation described by the wave function given by Eqs. (6.15) must be discussed\nseparately. Firstly it necessitates a confrontation with the conditions expressed by Eqs.\n(5.8). In this sense we note that for the respective situation one obtains the relation\n\u0010\n(\n\nL\u0302Z \u03a8l , \u03c6\u0302\u03a8l\n\n= i~ 1 + 2 Im\n\n\u0011\n\n\"\nXX\nm\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb\n\u2212 \u03a8l , Lz \u03c6\u0302\u03a8l =\n+\nCm \u0301m (Ylm , \u03c6\u0302Ylm \u0301)\nCm\n\nm \u0301\n\n#)\n\n(8.2)\n\nWhere Im \u03b1 denote the imaginary part of the complex quantity \u03b1. Then one observes that\nin the cases when the right hand term in Eq. (8.2) is null the variables LZ and \u03c6 satisfy the\nEqs.s (5.8). In such cases the Eqs. (2.3)/(5.13)/(6.4) are applicable. In other cases (when\nthe mentioned term from Eq. (8.2) is non-null) the Eqs. (5.8) are infringed and for the pair\nLZ \u2212 \u03c6 it must apply only the Eqs. (5.7) or (5.14).\nNote that the LZ \u2212 \u03c6 case in the situation described by wave functions from Eqs.(6.15)\ncan be approached also by using the Fourier analysis procedures. So for the mentioned case\nand situations, similarly with Eq. (5.41), one obtains\n)\n(\nXX\n\u2217\nCm\nCm\u2032 * m (Ylm , \u03c6Ylm\u2032 )\n\u2206\u03a8 LZ * \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 \u2265 Im\nm\n\n(8.3)\n\nm \u0301\n\nAs regards the case of QTP described by the wave functions given by Eqs. (6.18) we\nnote the following observations. In such a case the variables LZ and \u03c6 satisfy the conditions\n47\n\n\fexpressed by Eqs. (5.8). Consequently for the respective variables are applicable the Eqs.\n(2.3)/(5.13)(6.4). But the mentioned equations must be considered as resulting from more\ngeneral Eqs. (5.7) or (5.14) which are referring to the quantum fluctuations.\nThe problems with the pair energy-time mentioned in Sec. VI. H become senseless if it\nis accepted P \u2212 8.3. According to P \u2212 8.5 the relations mentioned in sections VI. I and VI.\nJ become simple generalizations of he theoretical HR without interpretational shortcoming.\nThe relations discussed in Sec. VI. K and VI. L are nothing but macroscopic similars of\nthe quantum theoretical HR. Also the respective relations do not imply any interpretational\nshortcoming. Moreover, the so-called macroscopic operators discussed in Sec. VI. L appear\nas pure inventions without any physical utility or significance.\n\u0007A reply addendum regarding the Lz \u2212\u03c6 pair\nOur first opinions about the Lz \u2212 \u03c6 pair in connection with TIHR were presented in\nearlier works (Dumitru 1977, 1980). Perhaps the respective presentations were more modest\nand less complete - e.g. we did not use at all the arguments resulting from the above\nmentioned examples of Lz - degenerate states or of QTP. Newertheless, we think that the\nalluded opinions were correct in their essence. However, in a review (Schroeck Jr., 1982) the\nrespective opinions were judged as being erroneous. In this addendum, by using some of the\nabove discussed facts, we wish to reply to the mentioned judgements.\nThe main error reproached by Prof. Schroeck to us is: \"most of the results stated concerning angular momentum and angle operators (including the supposed canonical commutation relations) are false, this being a consequence of not using Rieman-Stieljes integration\ntheory which is necessitated since the angle function has a jump discontinuity\". In order\nto answer to this reproach we resort to the following specifications: (i) One can see that\nthe respective reproach is founded, in fact, on the idea that the variable \u03c6 has a jump (of\nmagnitude 2\u03c0 at \u03c6 = 0 or, equivalently at \u03c6 = 2\u03c0) and, consequently, on the commutation\nh\ni\nbz , \u03c6\nrelation is L\nb = \u2212i~ + i~2\u03c0\u03b4 (where \u03b4 = Dirac delta function at the boundary \u03c6 = 0\n\u2212\n\nor \u03c6 = 2\u03c0). Note that the respective idea (confessed explicitly to us by Prof. Schroeck in\ntwo letters dated September 16, 1981 and April 2, 1982) can also be found in most TIHR\n48\n\n\fpublications. (ii) The mentioned idea refers, in fact, only to the systems which are \u03c6 circular and non-degenerate in respect with Lz (defined in the sense precised above in Sec.\nVI. F). But, strangely, it is associated with the supposition that the range of \u03c6 is the whole\ndomain (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), but not the finite interval [0, 2\u03c0]. (iii) Here is the place to add also the\ncases presented in Sec. VI. F of QTP and of the Lz - degenerate states (the last ones for\nthe situations with non-null term in the right hand side of Eq. (8.2)). For the respective\nh\ni\nbz , \u03c6\ncases we must consider, another commutation relation, namely L\nb = \u2212i~. (iv) Then in\nthe spirit of the mentioned idea for the same pair of variables Lz \u2212 \u03c6 one must tolerate two\nh\ni\nh\ni\nb\nb\ncompletely dissimilar commutation relations: Lz , \u03c6\nb = \u2212i~ + i~2\u03c0\u03b4 and Lz , \u03c6\nb = \u2212i~.\nBut such a toleration seems to be senseless and without any real (physical) substantion. (v)\n\nbz \u2212 \u03c6\nOur opinion about the L\nb pair remains, as it was announced in previous works, and\n\nargued with more details in the present paper. It is founded on the necessity to approach in\n\na unique manner all the alluded cases. In essence we think that, in all the respective cases,\nh\ni\nb\nfor the Lz \u2212 \u03c6 pair we must have an unique commutation relation, namely Lz , \u03c6\nb = \u2212i~.\n\u2212\n\nThe implementation of the respective relation in the mentioned cases for obtaining theoret-\n\nical formulae of HR-type must be made by taking into account the natural (physical) range\nof \u03c6 as well as the fulfillment of the Eqs. (5.8).\nThe ensemble of the above noted specifications proves as unfounded the reproaches of\nProfessor F.E. Schroeck Jr. regarding our opinions about the Lz \u2212 \u03c6 pair.\u0007\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nThe facts presented in this section show that all the problems directly connected with\nthe interpretation of HR can be solved by the here-proposed genuine reinterpretation of the\nrespective relations. But, as it is known, TIHR generated also disputes about the topics\nwhich are adjacent or additional with respect to the alluded problems. Several such topics\nwill be briefly approached in next sections.\n\n49\n\n\fIX. A RECONSIDERATION REGARDING THE MEASUREMENTS\n\nAs it was mentioned in Sec. II the story of HR started with the primary questions regarding the measuring uncertainties. During the years the respective questions and more\ngenerally the description of the measurements generated a large number of studies (a good\nlist of references, in this sense, can be obtained from the works: Yanase et al., 1978; Braginsky and Khalili 1992; Bush et. al., 1996; Hay and Peres, 1998; Sturzu, 1999 and surely from\nthe bibliographical publications indicated in the end of Sec. I). It is surprising to see that\nmany of the above alluded studies are contaminated one way or another by ideas pertaining\nto the TIHR doctrine. After the above exposed argumentation against TIHR, here we wish\nto present a few elements of a somewhat new reconsideration of the problems regarding the\ndescription of measurements (including of measuring uncertainties). We think that, even\nmodestly limited, such a reconsideration can be of non-trivial interest for our days \u0301science.\nThis because we agree with the opinion (Primas and M\u0171ller - Herold, 1978) that, in fact,\n\"there exists not yet a fundamental theory of actual measuring instruments\".\nFirstly, we note that, in our opinion, the questions P \u2212 2.1 \u2212 P \u2212 2.2 are of real significance for the studies of the physical systems. This fact is due to the essential role of measurements (i.e. of quantitatively evaluated experiments) for the mentioned studies. Moreover,\nwe think that, in principle, the alluded role appears both in quantum and non-quantum\nphysics.\nThen in our announced reconsideration we must try to search for natural answer to the\nquestions.. P \u2212 2.1 \u2212 P \u2212 2.2 as well as to some other (more or less) directly connected\nproblems. For such a purpose we shall note the remarks under the following points:\nP \u2212 9.1 : As a rule, all the measurements, both from macroscopic and microscopic\nphysics, are confronted with measuring uncertainties.N\nP \u2212 9.2 : The respective uncertainties are generated by various factors. Among such\nfactors the most important ones seem to be the intrinsic fluctuations within the experimental\ndevices and the measuring perturbations (due to the interactions of the respective devices\n\n50\n\n\fwith the measured systems).N\nP \u2212 9.3 : A quantitative description of the measuring uncertainties must be made in the\nframework of an authentic theory of measurements. The respective theory must be independent and additional with respect to the traditional chapters of physics (which describe\nthe intrinsic properties of physical systems).N\nP \u2212 9.4 : The measurement of a stochastic variable should not be reduced to a sole\ndetection. It must be regarded and managed as a statistical sampling (i.e. as a statistical\nensemble of detections). Therefore, for such a variable, the finding of a single value from\na sole detection does not mean the collapse of the corresponding stochastic characteristics\n(described by a wave function or by a probability density).N\nP \u2212 9.5 : In the spirit of the above remark the measuring uncertainties of stochastic\nvariables must be described in terms of quantities connected with the afferent statistical\nsampling but not with solitary detections.N\nP \u2212 9.6 : As regards the above alluded theory of measurements we agree with the idea\n(Bunge, 1977b) that it must include some specific elements, but not only generic-universal\naspects. This because every experimental apparatus, used in real measurements, has a\nwell-defined level of performance and a restricted class of utilizations - i.e. it is not a\ngeneric-universal (for all-purpose) device.N\nP \u2212 9.7 : Togheter with the mentioned agreement we opine that the measurements\ntheory can include also some elements/ideas with generic-universal characteristics. One\nsuch characteristic is connected with the fact that, in essence, every measurement can be\nregarded as an acquisition of some information about the measured system.N\nIn the spirit of the latter remark we think that from a generic-universal viewpoint a\nmeasurement can be described as a process of information transmission, from the measured\nsystem to the receiver (recorder or observer). In such a view, the measuring apparatus\ncan be represented as a channel for information transmission, whereas the measuring uncertainties can be pictured as an alteration of the processed information. Such informational\napproach is applicable for measurements on both macroscopic and microscopic (quantum)\n51\n\n\fsystems. Also the mentioned approach does not contradict to the idea of specificity as regards the measurements theory. The respective specificity is implemented in theory by the\nconcrete models/descriptions of the measured system (information source), of the measuring\napparatus(transmission channel), and of the recorder/observer (information receiver).\nFor an illustration of the above ideas let us refer to the description of the measurement of a single stochastic variable x having a continuous spectrum of values within the\nrange (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). The respective variable can be of classical kind (such are the macroscopic\nquantities discussed in connection with Eqs. (5.19)-(5.23)) or of a quantum nature (e.g. a\nCartesian coordinate of a microparticle).\nThe alluded measurement, being regarded as a statistical sampling, its usual task is to\nfind certain global probabilistic parameters of x such as: mean/expected value, standard\ndeviation, or even higher order moments. But the respective parameters are evaluated by\nmeans of the elementary probability dP = w (x) dx of finding the value of x within the\ninfinitesimal range (x, x + dx) . Here w (x) denotes the corresponding probability density.\nThen the mentioned task can be connected directly to w (x) .\nRelated to the measured system \u0301s own properties, w (x) has an IN (input) expression\nwIN (x).So viewed wIN (x) is assimilable with: (a) a usual distribution from classical statistical physics - in the case of a macroscopic system, respectively (b) the quantity |\u03a8 (x)|2 ;(\u03a8 (x)\n= the corresponding wave function) - in the case of a quantum microparticle.\nThe fact that the measuring apparatus distorts (alters) the information about the values\nof x means that the respective apparatus records an OUT (output) probability density\nwOU T (x) which generally differs from wIN (x). So, with respect to the measuring process,\nwIN (x) and wOU T (x) describe the input respectively the output information. Then it results\nthat the measuring uncertainties (alterations of the processed information) must be described\nin terms of several quantities depending on both wOU T (x) and wIN (x) .\nA description of the mentioned kind can be obtained, for instance, if one uses the following\nmean values:\n\n52\n\n\fhf iA =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nf (x) wA (x) dx, (A = IN; OUT )\n\n(9.1)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwith f (x) = an arbitrary function of x. Then a possible quantitative evaluation of the\nmeasuring disturbances can be made in terms of both the following parameters:\n(i) the mean value uncertainty given by\n\u03b4 (hxi) = hxiOU T \u2212 hxiIN\n\n(9.2)\n\n(ii) the standard deviation uncertainty defined as\n\u03b4 (\u2206x) = \u2206OU T x \u2212 \u2206IN x\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\nwhere \u2206A x = hx2 iA \u2212 hxA i2\n,\n\n(9.3)\n\n(A = IN; OUT ).\n\nThe mentioned evaluation can be enriched by also using the higher order probabilistic\n\nmoments/correlations (in the sense discussed by Dumitru (1999)).\nAnother evaluation of the measuring uncertainties can be made by means of the informational entropy uncertainty\n\u03b4H = HOU T \u2212 HIN\n\n(9.4)\n\nHere the informational entropies HA (A = IN; OUT ) are defined by\nHA = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nwA (x) ln [1x wA (x)] dx\n\n(9.5)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere 1x = the unit of the physical variable x.\nDue to the fact that, in the present considerations, a measurement is regarded as a\nstatistical sampling, the parameters defined by Eqs. (9.2)-(9.4) can be called statistical\nuncertainties.\nThe uncertainty parameters introduced by Eqs. (9.2)-(9.4) can be detailed if one takes\ninto account more elements regarding the characteristics of the measuring apparatus and/or\nof the measured system. So we can refer to an apparatus modeled as an (information)\ntransmission channel with stationary and linear characteristics.. Then we can write\n53\n\n\fwOU T (x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nG (x, x \u0301) wIN (x \u0301) dx \u0301\n\n(9.6)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the kernel G (x, x \u0301) must satisfy the normalization conditions\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nG (x, x \u0301) dx =\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nG (x, x \u0301) dx \u0301= 1\n\n(9.7)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe measurement is ideal or real (non-ideal) in the cases when wOU T (x) = wIN (x) respectively wOU T (x) 6= wIN (x). In the above model such cases appear if we take G (x, x \u0301) =\n\u03b4 (x \u2212 x \u0301) respectively G (x, x \u0301) 6= \u03b4 (x \u2212 x \u0301), with \u03b4 (x \u2212 x \u0301) as Dirac \u03b4 function of x \u2212 x \u0301. Then\nby using Eqs. (9.4)-(9.6) and by taking into account the relation ln y \u2264 y \u2212 1, (y > 0) , one\nobtains\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nwOU T (x)\n\u03b4H = \u2212\ndx\ndx \u0301G (x, x \u0301) wIN (x \u0301) ln\n\u2265\nwIN (x \u0301)\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0015\nwOU T (x)\n\u22121 = 0\n\u2265\u2212\ndx\ndx \u0301G (x, x \u0301) wIN (x \u0301)\nwIN (x \u0301)\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(9.8)\n\n\u03b4H = HOU T \u2212 HIN \u2265 0\n\n(9.9)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\n\u221e\n\nSo we find\n\nThis relation shows that for the processed information (measurement of x) the entropy H\nat the recorder is greater (or at least equal) than at the measured system. In terms of\nthe entropy uncertainty we can speak of ideal respectively real (non-ideal) measurement as\n\u03b4H = 0 or \u03b4H 6= 0.\nWe can detail even more the above ideas by the following example. Let us consider x\nas coordinate of a rectilinear quantum oscillator situated in its lowest energy state.

(9.10). As it is\nknown the respective wave function is given in x -representation. But it can be transcribed\nin p-representation in the form:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\u0010\u221a\np2\n2\u03c0\u03bcIN\nexp \u2212\n\u03a8 (p) =\n4\u03bcIN\n\n(9.21)\n\nwith \u03bcIN = (~m\u03c9/2) . So all the above considerations can be transcribed from a x-variable\nversion in a p-variable form.\nThen the IN- expressions for the probability distribution respectively for mean value\nand standard deviation of p are\n2\n\nwIN (p) = |\u03a8 (p)| =\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\n2\u03c0\u03bcIN\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\np2\nexp \u2212 2\n2\u03bcIN\n\nhpiIN = 0\n\u2206IN p = \u03bcIN =\n\n(9.22)\n\n(9.23)\n\nr\n\n~m\u03c9\n2\n\n(9.24)\n\nIf the p-measuring device is also characterized by small errors it can be described by the\nkernel\n\u2032\n\nG (p, p ) =\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\n2\u03c0\u03bcD\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\n(p \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212 p\u2032 )\nexp \u2212\n2\u03bc2D\n\n(9.25)\n\nwith \u03b7 and \u03bcD as precision indices of the device. Similarly with the x-variable case for\nthe momentum p one finds that the distribution wOU T (p)characterizing the output of the\nmeasuring process is given by\nwOU T (p) =\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\n2\u03c0 * \u03bcOU T\n\n\u0011\u22121\n56\n\n(\n\n(p \u2212 \u03b7)2\nexp \u2212\n2\u03bc2OU T\n\n)\n\n(9.26)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03bc2OU T = \u03bc2IN + \u03bc2D\n\n(9.28)\n\nThen the OUT -expression of the mean value and standard deviation for p are\nhpiOU T = \u03b7\n\u2206OU T p = \u03bcOU T\n\n(9.29)\n\nq\n= (\u2206IN p)2 + \u03bc2D\n\n(9.30)\n\nCorrespondingly, the uncertainties of the mean value and standard deviation of p are\n\u03b4 (hpi) = \u03b7\n\n\u03b4 (\u2206p) = \u2206IN p\n\n\uf8f1s\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\n(9.31)\n\n\u03bcD\n\u2206IN p\n\n\u00132\n\n\u22121\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n(9.32)\n\n\uf8fe\n\nAlso for the uncertainty regarding the informational entropy for the p variable one obtains\ns\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00132\n\u03bcD\n\u03bcOU T\n\u03b4Hp = ln\n= ln 1 +\n(9.33)\n\u03bcIN\n\u2206IN p\nNow, the above presented statistical uncertainties for x and p can be regarded together\nfor a possible comparison with some supposed ideas from the TIHR doctrine. For such a\npurpose we consider the following products:\n\u03b4 (hxi) * \u03b4 (hpi) = \u03b5 * \u03b7\n\n(9.34)\n\n\u03b4 (\u2206x) * \u03b4 (\u2206p) = \u2206IN x * \u2206IN p*\n\nx\n\n\uf8f1s\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3D\n\u2206IN x\n\n\u03b4Hx * \u03b4Hp = ln\n\ns\n\n\u00132\n\n\uf8fc \uf8f1s\n\uf8fc\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\uf8fd \uf8f2\n\uf8fd\n\u03bcD\n\u22121 *\n\u22121\n1+\n\uf8fe \uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n\u2206IN p\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3D\n\u2206IN x\n\n\u00132\n\n57\n\n* ln\n\ns\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bcD\n\u2206IN p\n\n\u00132\n\n(9.35)\n\n(9.36)\n\n\fAs we have discussed in sections II and VI, TIHR supposes that the product of the\nuncertainties for x and p has a non-null inferior limit. The respective limit is expressed\nonly in terms of the fundamental constant ~, and it is completely independent of certain\ncharacteristics regarding the measuring device. Comparatively, from Eqs. (9.34)-(9.36) it\nresults that the products of the statistical uncertainties for x and p are directly dependent\non the precision parameters \u03b5, \u03b7, \u03c3D and \u03bcD of the measuring devices. If all the respective\nparameters are null (case of ideal measurements) the mentioned products are also null. This\nmeans that the products of the mentioned statistical uncertainties for x and p have not a\nnon-null inferior limit.\nNow note that, in the here-proposed model for describing the measurements, the x - and\np - devices are considered as completely independent. In principle, the respective devices can\nbe coupled in a more complex x & p - instrument. A theoretical model for the description\nof measurements with such an instrument can be obtained only by using a set of adequately\njustified hypotheses. In such a model probably that the above presented kernels G (x, x \u0301)\nand G (p, p \u0301)must be regarded as resulting from a more complex quantity dependent on both\npairs x \u2212 x \u0301 and p \u2212 p \u0301. But a x \u2212 p couplage of the mentioned kind still requires further\ninvestigations. Then, probably, the problem of the product of adequate x-and p-uncertainties\nwill be also discussed.\n\nX. THE SIMILAR STOCHASTIC SIGNIFICANCES OF PLANCK'S AND BOLTZMANN'S\nCONSTANTS\n\nIn sectionsV, VI, and VII we have argued that the theoretical HR from quantum mechanics given by Eqs. (2.2)-(2.3) have authentic nonquantum analogs. But the mentioned\nHR are commonly associated with Planck \u0301s constant ~. Then there naturally arises the\nquestion whether ~ also has an authentic analog in nonquantum physics. Now, in this section we shall present a lot of elements which reveal that the answer to the above question\nis affirmative. The alluded analog of ~ is shown to be the Boltzmann \u0301s constant k. The\n\n58\n\n\fviewed analogy is given by the fact that ~ and k have similar roles of generic indicators of\nthe onefold stochasticity (randomness) for well-specified classes of physical systems (i.e. for\nindividual quantum microparticles and macroscopic nonquantum systems, respectively).\nA physical system is considered to have stochastic respectively nonstochastic characteristics depending on the probabilistic nature of its specific variables. For a system, the\nlevel (degree) of stochasticity depends on the frame (approach) in which it is studied. So,\nfor a macroscopic system consisting of a large ensemble of molecules, the stochasticity is\nsignificant in statistical physics approach but it is completely unimportant in the frame of\ncontinuous mechanics or of thermodynamics.. Also, in the case of a microparticle of atomic\nsize, the stochastic characteristics are essential from a quantum mechanics view, but they\nare negligible from a classical mechanics perspective. Of course, the level of stochasticity can\nbe described by means of certain fluctuation quantities such as the ones defined/implied in\nEqs. (4.3), (5.4), (5.6), (5.15), (5.20) and (5.24). But the respective quantities take particular expressions (and values) for diverse variables or various systems. Therefore, they cannot\nbe considered as generic indicators of stochasticity, i.e. as parameters indicating generically\nthe stochasticity level for a set or variables or for a whole class of systems. Below we shall\nshow that the roles of such generic indicators of stochasticity are played, in similar ways,\nby the constants k and ~ for the macroscopic nonquantum systems and individual quantum\nmicroparticles, respectively.\nFirstly, let us discuss the alluded role for k with respect to the macroscopic systems.\nIf such a system is studied in the framework of phenomenological (quasithermodynamic)\ntheory of fluctuations (Munster, 1960, 1969; Dumitru, 1974a; Landau and Lifschitz, 1984),\nits microscopic-molecular structure is completely neglected. Also, its specific variables are\nglobal macroscopic quantities regarded as real stochastic variables with continuous spectra\nof values. For such a system, in the mentioned approach, the fluctuations of the variables\nas pressure P and volume V are described by the quantities \u2206w V, \u2206w P and h\u03b4w V \u03b4w P iw\ngiven in Eq. (6.40). More generally, for the same system we can consider two arbitrary\nvariables A = A (Xj )and B = B (Xj )regarded as functions of certain independent variables\n59\n\n\fXj (j = 1, 2, ...., n) . Then the correlation h\u03b4w A\u03b4w Biw describing the fluctuations of A and\nB is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\nn X\nn\nX\n\u2202A \u2202B\n\u22022S\nh\u03b4w A\u03b4w Biw = k\n\u2202Xj \u2202Xl \u2202Xj \u2202Xl\nj=1 l=1\n\n(10.1)\n\nwhere A = hAiw , [ajl ]\u22121 denotes the inverse of the matrix ajl and S = S (Xj )is the entropy\nof system.\nAs an example from classical statistical physics we can consider the system referred in\nconnection with the Eqs. (6.41)-(6.42). The corresponding stochastic variables are H and\nZc . Their fluctuations are described by the quantities \u2206w H, \u2206w Zc and h\u03b4w H\u03b4w Zc iw whose\nexpressions are given by Eqs. (6.42).\nNow we can proceed to a direct examination of the expressions from Eqs. (6.40), (10.1)\nand (6.42) of the quantities \u2206w A and h\u03b4w A\u03b4w Biw which describe the thermal fluctuations in\nmacroscopic systems. One can observe that all the respective expressions are structured as\nproducts of k with terms which are independent from k. The alluded independence is ensured\nby the fact that the mentioned terms are expressed only by means of macroscopic nonstochastic quantities. (Note that the mean values A from the respective terms must coincide\nwith deterministic (i.e. nonstochastic) quantities from usual thermodynamics). Due to the\nabove observed structure, the examined fluctuation quantities are in a direct dependence\nof k. So they are significant respectively negligible as we take k 6= 0 or k \u2192 0. Because\nk is a constant, the limit k \u2192 0 must be regarded in the sense that the quantities directly\nproportional with k are negligible comparatively with other terms of the same dimensionality\nbut not containing k. However, the fluctuations reveal the stochastic characteristics of the\nphysical systems. Then we can conclude that the thermal stochasticity, for the system\nstudied in nonquantum statistical physics, is an important respectively insignificant property\nas we consider k 6= 0 or k \u2192 0.\nThe mentioned features vis-a-vis the values of k are specific for all the macroscopic\nsystems (e.g. gases, liquids and solids of various inner compositions) and for all their specific\nglobal variables. But such a remark reveals the fact that k has the qualities of an authentic\n60\n\n\fgeneric indicator for thermal stochasticity (i.e. for the stochasticity evidenced through the\nthermal fluctuations).\nNow let us approach questions connected with the quantum stochasticity which is specific\nfor the individual, nonrelativistic microparticles of atomic size. Such a kind of stochasticity\nis revealed by the specific quantum fluctuations of the corresponding variables (of orbital and\nspin nature). The respective fluctuations described by means of quantities like the standard\ndeviations and correlations defined in Eqs. (5.2) and (5.15). Some expressions, e.g. those\ngiven by Eqs. (6.19) and (6.38), for the mentioned fluctuation quantities show the direct\ndependence of the respective quantities on the Planck \u0301s constant ~. Then, there results\nthat ~ can play the role of generic indicator for quantum stochasticity. Corespondingly, as\n~ 6= 0 or ~ \u2192 0 the mentioned stochasticity appears as a significant respectively negligible\nproperty.\nThe above mentioned connection between the quantum stochasticity and ~ must be\ncomplemented with certain deeper considerations. Such considerations regard (Dumitru\nand Veriest, 1995) different behaviour patterns of various physical variables in the limit\n~ \u2192 0, usually called Quantum \u2192Classical Limit (QCL).\nFirstly, let us refer to the spin variables. We consider an electron whose spin state is\ndescribed by the function (spinor) \u03c7 given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec cos \u03b1 \uf8f7\n\u03c7=\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nsin \u03b1\n\nh \u03c0i\n\u03b1 \u2208 0,\n2\n\n(10.2)\n\nFor a specific variable we take the z-component of the spin angular moment Sbz = (~/2) \u03c3bz\n\n(b\n\u03c3z being the corresponding Pauli matrix). For the respective variable in the mentioned\nstate we find\n\u2206\u03c7 Sz =\n\n~\nsin 2\u03b1\n2\n\n(10.3)\n\nThe quantity \u2206\u03c7 Sz describes the quantum fluctuations of spin kind i.e. the spin quantum\nstochasticity. The presence of ~ in Eq. (10.3) show that the respective stochasticity is\n61\n\n\fsignificant or not as ~ 6= 0 or ~ \u2192 0. This means that ~ plays the role of generic indicator\nfor the respective stochasticity. But in the state described by Eq. (10.2) one finds also\nhSz ix = (~/2) cos \u03b1. This additional results shows that, in fact, for ~ \u2192 0 the variable Sz\ndisappears completely. Then we can note that for spin variables the behaviour pattern in\nquantum \u2192classical limit consists of an annulment of both stochastic characteristics and\nmean values (i.e. in a complete disappearance).\nIn the case of orbital quantum variables the quantum \u2192classical limit implies not only the\ncondition ~ \u2192 0 but also the requirement that certain quantum numbers grow unboundedly..\nThe mentioned requirement is due to the fact that certain significant variables connected\nwith the orbital motion (e.g. the energy) pass from their quantum values to adequate\nclassical values. So, with respect to the mentioned limit the orbital variables have two kinds\nof behaviour patterns.\nAs an example of the first kind we refer to the coordinate x of a harmonic rectilinear\noscillator considered in its n-th energy level. Then similarly with \u2206\u03a8 \u03c6 from Eq. (6.19) we\nhave:\n\u0014\n\n~\n\u2206\u03a8 x =\nm\u03c9\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u00151/2\n1\nn+\n2\n\n(10.4)\n\nwhere m, \u03c9 and n denote the mass, the angular frequency respectively the oscillation quantum number. For the mentioned example the quantum \u2192classical limit means not only\n~ \u2192 0 but also n \u2192 \u221e. This because the energy must pass from the quantum expression\n\u0001\nE = ~\u03c9 n + 21 to the corresponding classical expression Ecl = 12 m\u03c9 2 x20 , where x0 is the\n\ncoordinate amplitude. Then the standard deviation of x passes from the quantum value\ngiven by Eq. (10.4) to the classical value\nx0\n\u2206cl x = \u221a\n2\n\n(10.5)\n\nBut \u2206\u03a8 x and \u2206cl x are fluctuation parameters which describe the stochastic characteristics of\nx in quantum respectively classical contexts. Then one can say that in quantum \u2192classical\nlimit the above considered coordinate x preserves both its role of significant variable and its\nstochasticity.\n62\n\n\fAs an example of the second kind of orbital variable we consider the distance r between\nthe electron and nucleus in a hydrogen atom. We refer to an electron in a state described\nby the wave function \u03a8nlm with l = n \u2212 1 (where n.l and m are respectively the principal,\norbital and magnetic quantum numbers). Then for \u2206\u03a8 r = \u2206r we can use the expression\ngiven by Schwabl (1995), rewritten in the form\n\u2206r =\n\n2\u03c0\u03b50 2\n~ n (n + 1)1/2\nm0 e\n\n(10.6)\n\nwith m0 and e denoting the mass respectively the change of the electron. The energy of the\nelectron is\nm0 e4\nEn = \u2212\n32\u03c0 2 \u03b520 ~2 n2\n\n(10.7)\n\nThe quantum\u2192classical limit requires that En \u2192 Ecl with Ecl denoting the classical value\nof the energy. Then from Eqs. (10.6) and (10.7) it results that in the respective limit we\nhave\n\u2206r \u2192\n\n\u0012\n\n~e4\n16\u03c0\u03b50\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(\u22122m0 Ecl )\u22121/4\n\n(10.8)\n\nIn the same circumstances we obtain\nhri\u03a8 \u2192 rcl = \u2212\n\ne2\n8\u03c0\u03b50 Ecl\n\n(10.9)\n\nSo it results that in the quantum\u2192classical limit (when ~ \u2192 0 and En \u2192 Ecl ) we have\n\u2206r \u2192 0 and hri\u03a8 \u2192 rcl 6= 0. This means that r preserves its role of significant variable but\nloses its stochasticity.\nThe above considerations can be concluded with the following remark:\nP \u2212 10.1 : In the quantum\u2192classical limit the physical variables display the following\ndifferent behaviour patterns:\n(i) The complete disappearance of both stochastic characteristics and mean values, as in\nthe case of spin variables.\n(ii) The preservation of both the role of significant variable and of stochastic characteristics, as in the case of oscillator coordinate\n63\n\n\f(iii) The preservation of the role of significant variable but the loss of stochastic characteristics as in the case of electron-nucleus distance.N\nIt is clear that the above remark corrects the traditional belief of a unique behaviour\npattern compulsorily associated with the disappearance of the \"uncertainties\" (i.e. of the\nstandard deviations \u2206\u03a8 A).\nNow let us return to the quantum stochasticity, specific for the variables of individual\nmicroparticles. We think that, in spite of the peculiarities mentioned in P \u2212 10.1, the Planck\nconstant ~ can be considered as a generic indicator of such a stochasticity. Moreover, we\nconsider that the respective role of ~ is completely similar with that the Boltzmann constant\nk with respect to the macroscopic thermal stochasticity (see above).\nRegarding the mentioned roles of ~ and k another observation must be added. In the\ndiscussed cases, ~ and k appear independently and singly. That is why one can say that\nthe stochasticity of the corresponding systems (microparticles and classical macroscopic\nsystems) has a onefold character. But there are also physical systems endowed with a\ntwofold stochasticity characterized by a simultaneous connection with both ~ and k. Such\nsystems are those studied in quantum statistical physics, i.e., the bodies of macroscopic\nsize considered as statistical ensembles of quantum microparticles. The stochasticity of the\nrespective systems is revealed by corresponding fluctuations described by the quantities given\nby Eqs. (5.24) which depend simultaneously on both ~ and k. The respective dependence\nis revealed by the so-called fluctuation-dissipation theorem. According to the respective\ntheorem (Kubo 1957; Zubarev 1971; Balescu 1975) one can write\nD\nE\nD\nE\nb \u03c1B\nb + \u03b4\u03c1 B\u03b4\nb \u03c1A\nb =\n\u03b4\u03c1 A\u03b4\n\u03c1\n\ni\n=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n~ coth\n\n\u0012\n\n~\u03c9\n2kT\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c1\n\n[\u03c7\u2217AB (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c7BA (\u03c9)] d\u03c9\n\n(10.11)\n\nwith \u03c7\u2217AB (\u03c9) as complex conjugate of \u03c7AB (\u03c9) .\nIn Eq. (10.11) \u03c7AB (\u03c9) represent the generalized susceptibilities which appears also in the\ndeterministic framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics (De Groot and Mazur, 1962).\n64\n\n\fBut it is a known fact that in the respective framework all the stochastic characteristics of\nphysical variables are neglected and no miscroscopic (i.e. atomic or molecular) structure\nof the systems is taken into account. Another fact is that \u03c7AB (\u03c9) are directly connected\n(Landau and Lifschitz, 1984) with the macroscopic nonstochastic expression of the energy\ndissipated inside the thermodynamic systems actioned by external deterministic and macroscopic perturbations. The mentioned facts show that the susceptibilities \u03c7AB (\u03c9) do not\ndepend on the constants ~ and k.\nThe above mentioned property of \u03c7AB (\u03c9) combined with Eq. (10.11) shows that the\nsole significant dependence of fluctuation quantities given by Eq. (5.24) on the constants k\nand ~ is given by the factor ~ coth (~\u03c9/kT ). For the respective factor one can write\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n~\u03c9\nlim lim ~ coth\nk\u21920 ~\u21920\n2kT\n\n\u0013\u0015\u001b\n\n=0\n\n(10.12)\n\nThis means that when both ~ and k tend to zero the fluctuation quantities defined by Eq.\n(5.24) become null. So it results that in the mentioned limit the fluctuations in quantum\nstatistical systems cease to manifest themselves. Consequently, for such a limit the respective\nsystems lose their stochastic characteristics. Then in the spirit of the above presented\nopinions one can state that quantum statistical systems can be considered as endowed with\na twofold stochasticity of the thermal and quantum type, revealed respectively by k and ~\nas generic indicators.\nIn the above considerations the stochasticity appears as a property of exclusively intrinsic\ntype. This means that it is connected only with the internal (inner) characteristics of\nthe considered systems and does not depend on external (outside) factors. Moreover the\nmentioned stochasticity is directly and strongly associated with ~ and k as generic indicators.\nBut the stochasticity can be also of extrinsic type. In such cases it is essentially connected\nwith factors from the outside (surroundings) of the considered physical systems. Also the\nextrinsic stochasticity is not (necessarily) associated with ~ and k. As examples of system\nwith stochasticity of exclusively extrinsic type can be considered an empty bottle floating\non a stormy sea or a die in a game.\n65\n\n\fIn practice one finds also systems endowed with stochasticity of both the intrinsic and\nextrinsic types. Such are for example, the electric and electronic circuits. For a circuit\nthe intrinsic stochasticity is caused by the thermal agitation of the charge carries and/or\nof elementary (electric or magnetic) dipoles inside of its constitutive elements (i.e. inside\nof resistors, inductances, condensers, transistors, integrated circuits, etc.). The respective\nagitation is responsible for fluctuations of macroscopic voltages and currents. Such fluctuations are known (Robinson, 1974) as thermal (or Nyquist) noises. Note that in the case\nof circuits the intrinsic stochasticity is characterized by generic indicators. Such indicators\nare k alone, if the circuit is considered as a classical (nonquantum) statistical system, and\nk together with ~ when the circuit is viewed as a quantum statistical system. Otherwise,\nthe stochasticity of a circuit can also be of extrinsic type when it is under the influence\nof a large variety of factors. Such factors can be: thermal fluctuations in the surrounding\nmedium, accidental outside discharges and inductions, atmospheric (or even cosmic) electrical phenomena. The mentioned extrinsic stochasticity is also responsible for the noises in\nmacroscopic currents and voltages in the circuits. But it must be noted that even for circuits,\nthe extrinsic stochasticity is not connected in principle with generic indicators dependent\non fundamental physical constants (such as ~ and k). As an interesting case which implies\nstochasticity of both intrinsic and extrinsic type can be considered a measuring process\nviewed as in Sec. IX. In such a case the intrinsic stochasticity regards the inner properties\nof the measured system while the extrinsic one is due to the measuring apparatus. The\ncorresponding intrinsic stochasticity is connected with ~ and k as generic indicators in the\nabove discussed sense. However, the extrinsic stochasticity, due to the apparatus, seems\nto be not connected with certain generic indicators. This because of the large diversity of\napparata as regards their own structure and accuracy.\n\n66\n\n\fXI. A FEW REMARKS ON SEVERAL ADJACENT QUESRTIONS\n\nWith respect to problematics of HR proper, in literature (see the bibliographical publications mentioned in the end of Sec. I) one knows of a large variety of adjacent questions\nwhich, one way or another, are allied with the subjects discussed in the previous sections of\nthis paper. Now, we wish to note a few remarks on several such questions.\n\u0007 Firstly, let us refer to the consequences of the here-proposed reconsideration of HR\nfor both lucrative procedures and interpretational frame of quantum mechanics. Note that\nour reconsideration does not prejudice in any way the authentic version of the mentioned\nlucrative procedures, which, in fact, have met with unquestionable successes in both basic\nand aplicative researches. As regards the alluded interpretational frame, our reconsideration,\nmainly by the abandonment of TIHR, generates major and important changes. But such\nchanges must be regarded as benefic, since they can offer a genuine elucidation to the\ncontroversial questions introduced in the frame of science by TIHR.\u0004\n\u0007 By reinterpreting HR in the sense presented in Sec.VIII the respective relations lose\ntheir quality of crucial physical formulae. So, one can find a consonance with the prediction\n(Dirac, 1963): \"I think one can make a safe guess that uncertainty relations in their present\nform will not survive in the physics of future\". Note that the above prediction was founded\nnot on some considerations about the essence of HR but on a supposition about the future\nrole of ~ in physics. So it was supposed that ~ will be a derived quantity while c and e\n(speed of light and elementary charge) will remain as fundamental constants. That is why\nwe wish to add here that our view about HR does not affect the actual position of ~ as a\nphysical constant. More precisely, our findings cannot answer the question whether ~ will\nbe a fundamental constant or a derived quantity (e.g. expressed in terms of c and e).\u0004\n\u0007 As it was pointed in Sec.X the Planck's constant ~ has also the significance of estimator\nfor the spin of microparticles (like the electron). So the spin appears to be a notable\nrespectively absent property as ~ 6= 0 or ~ \u2192 0. On the other hand with the reference to the\nspin there are also some intriguing questions related to its relativistic justification. Usually\n67\n\n\f(Dirac, 1958; Blochintsev,1981) for electrons the spin is regarded to be essentially explicable\nas consequence of relativistic theory. But, as it is known, the relativistic characteristics of a\nparticle are evidenced by the relative value v/c of its velocity v comparatively with the light\nvelocity c. Particularly, the respective characteristics must be insignificant when v/c \u226a 1\nor c \u2192 \u221e. Then the absence of the factor v/c (or of some other equivalent factors) in the\ndescription of the electron spin variable appears at least as intriguing fact. Is such a fact a\nsufficient reason to consider ~ as a derived quantity in the sense guessed by Dirac (1963). In\nsuch a sense ~ =\n\ne2\n4\u03c0*\u03b50 *c*\u03b1\n\n(\u03b5o = the permittivity of vacuum and \u03b1 =\n\n1\n137\n\n= the fine structure\n\nconstant) and the situations with ~ \u2192 0 appear when c \u2192 \u221e. So the significance of ~ as\nspin estimator can be apparently related with some aspects of relativity. But here it must be\nnoted the surprising fact that even in the nonrelativistic limit (i.e. when v/c \u226a 1 or c \u2192 \u221e)\nthe spin remains a significant variable of the electron. It is known (Ivanov, 1989) that the\nelectron spin plays a decisive role (as a fourth quantum variable/number) in the electronic\nconfiguration of many-electronic atoms, in spite of the fact that for atomic electrons v/c \u226a 1.\nDue to the here mentioned features we think that the relativistic justification of the spin\nappears as a intriguing question witch requires further investigations.\u0004\n\u0007 Our findings facilitate also a remark in connection with another supposition about\n~. The respective supposition regards the possible existence of multiple Planck constants\nassociated with various kinds of microparticles (e.g. with electrons, protons, neutrons).\nCurrently, (Whichman, 1971; Fischbach et. al. 1991), the tendency is to contest such\na possibility and to promote the idea of a unique Planck constant. For this one appeals\neither to experimental data or to some connection with the fundamental conservation laws.\nWe think that our view about ~ pleads somewhat for the alluded idea of uniqueness.. So,\nregarding ~ as generic indicator of quantum stochasticity, this one must have the same value\nfor various kinds of microparticles. This because, similarly, the Boltzman constant k in its\nrole of generic indicator for thermal stochasticity has a unique value for various kinds of\nmacroscopic systems (e.g. hydrogen gas, liquid water or crystallin germanium ).\n\u0007 The revealed stochastic similarity among quantum microparticles and macroscopic\n68\n\n\fsystems facilitates another remark. In the macroscopic case the stochastic characteristics\nfor an individual system is incorporated in the probability distribution w (see sections V\nand VI. K). As we have shown, the quantum similar of w(x) is the wave function \u03a8 (or the\nsquare |\u03a8|2 of its module). Such a w \u2212 \u03a8 similarity motivates us to agree the idea (Van\nKampen 1978) that \u03a8 refer to a single system (microparticle). Simultaneously, we incline to\na circumspect regard about the opinions that \u03a8 belongs to an \"ensemble of equally prepared\nsystems\" (Tschudi, 1987) or to an \"abstract physical object\" (Mayants,1984). Moreover, our\nagreement and opinion are also motivated by the observation that in practical applications\nboth \u03a8 and w are calculated for individual systems (e.g. for an electron in a hydrogen atom\nor, respectively for an ideal gas).\u0004\n\u0007A distinct group of remarks regards the reduction of stochasticity to subjacent elements of deterministic nature, for both cases of thermodynamic systems and quantum\nmicroparticles. In the first case the stochasticity refers to the macroscopic variables which\ncharacterize each system as a whole. But according to the classical statistical mechanics the\nrespective variables are expressible in terms of subjacent molecular quantities (coordinates\nand momenta) which are considered as deterministic elements. In the case of quantum microparticles a similar problem was taken into account. So it was promoted the idea that\nthe stochastic quantum variables (characterizing each microparticle as a whole) would be\nexpressible in terms of some sujacent elements of deterministic nature, called \"hidden variables\". Viewing comparatively the two mentione d cases we think that is of nontrivial\ninterest ti note the foolowing observations:\n(i) In the case of thermodynamic systems the subjacent molecular quantities can be\njustfied in essence only by adequate experimental facts.\n(ii) The mentioned molecular quantities are deterministic (i. e. depresionfree) only\nfrom a microscopic perspective, connected with the characteristics of the molecules. From\na macroscopic perspective, coonected with a thermodynamic systems as a whole, they are\nstochastic variables. That is why, for example, in respect with a thermodynamic system\nlike an ideal gas one speaks about the mean value and non-null dispersion of the molecular\n69\n\n\fvelocity.\n(iii) Even by taking into account the existence of sujacent molecular quantities the macroscopic variables, characterizing a thermodynamic system as a whole, keep their stochastic\ncharacteristics. Particularly the mentioned existence does not influence the verity or the\nsignificance of the macroscopic relations frim the family of Eqs. (5.21) - (5.23).\n(iv) The above observations (i) - (iii) reveal as unfounded the idea (uffink and Van Lith\n1999) that the sole examination of some theoretical formulas, from the mentioned family,\ncan give a light on the problem of reduction of thermodynamic stochasticity to subjacend\ndeterministic elements.\n(v) By analogy with the fact noted in (i), in the case of quantum microparticles, the\nexistence of the \"hidden variables\" must be proved firstly by indubitable experimental facts.\nBut, as far as we know, until now such an experimental proof was not ratified by scientific\nresearch.\n(vi) The existence of the mentioned \"hidden variables\" cannot be asserted only by means\nof considerations on some theoretical formulas regarding the global stochasticity of quantum\nmicroparticles, such are the HR.\n(vii) The global description of a quantum microparticle remain equally probabilistic in\nboth cases, with or without \"hidden variables\". More exactly in both casses for a variable refering to a quantum microparticle as a whole the theoretical predictions must be\ndone in probabilistic terms while the experimental informations can be obtained only from\nmeasurements consisting in statistical samplings.\n\u0007 The discussions from Sec. X about the stochasticity suggest a remark connected with\nthe Boltzmann \u0301s constant k. As we have shown k plays a major role in the evaluation of\nthe level of the thermal stochasticity. But the respective stochasticity must be regarded\nas an important property of the macroscopic systems. So one finds as unfounded the idea,\npromoted in some publications (Wichman, 1971; Landau and Lifschitz, 1984; Storm, 1986)\nthat, in physics k has only a minor role of conversion factor between temperature scales\n(from energetic units into Kelvin degrees).\u0004\n70\n\n\fXII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe started the paper reminding the fact that even in our days TIHR persists as a\nsource of unelucidated controversies about it defects. Motivated by the respective fact we\nproposed an investigation in the very core of the alluded controversies and defects. For such\na purpose firstly we identified the main elements (assertions and arguments) of TIHR. Then,\nin reference with the mentioned elements, we localized the most known and critical defects\nof TIHR.\nIn such a reference frame we analyzed the reality of the respective defects. We found that\nall of them are veridical. Moreover, for TIHR, they are insurmountable and incriminate each\nof its main elements. So we can conclude that the sole reasonable attitude is to abandon\nTIHR as an unjustified doctrine.\nThe mentioned abandonment must be accompanied with a search for a new and genuine reinterpretation of HR. On this direction we opine that HR of troughs-experimental\nnature must be disregarded because they are fictitious formulae without a true physical\nsignificance. On the other hand we think that the theoretical HR are authentic physical\nformulae regarding the quantum fluctuations. So regarded the theoretical HR belong to\na large class of formulae specific for systems, of both quantum and non-quantum nature,\nendowed with stochastic characteristics. By adopting the mentioned regards about HR all\nthe controversies connected with the TIHR are elucidated on a natural way.\nIn the mentioned regard HR lose their traditional role of crucial physical formulae connected with the description of measurement characteristics (uncertainties). In the here\npromoted view the respective description must be done in terms (and formulae) which do\nnot belong to the traditional chapter of physics (including the quantum mechanics). We suggested that a promising version for the description of measurements can be done in terms\nof information theory. So a measurement can be considered as an information transmission,\nfrom the measured system (information source) through the measuring device (transmission\nchannel) to the device recorder (information receiver). Then the measuring uncertainties\n\n71\n\n\fappear as alternations of processed information. In the Sec. IX we illustrated the alluded\ninformational model with some concrete considerations.\nIn our opinion the theoretical HR and their classical (non-quantum) similars are connected with the stochasticity regarded as an important property of physical systems. We\nshowed that the respective property is characterized by generic indicators which are:\n(i) the Planck's constant ~ (for quantum microparticles),\n(ii) the Boltzmann's constant k (for classical thermodynamical system), respectively\n(iii) both ~ and k (for quantum statistical systems).\nIn the end, in Sec. XI, we presented remarks on some questions which are adjacent with\nthe subjects discussed in the other parts of the paper.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n\u0007 Several publications studied by me in connection with this and other previous papers\nof mine were put at my disposal by their authors (often in a preprint or amended-reprint\nform). To all the respective authors I express my sincere thanks.\n\u0007 Refering to my own views, during the years, I have received many comments which\nstimulated my work. I remain profoundly grateful to the corresponding commentators (referees and readers of my papers, colleagues). But, of course, that for all the shortcomings of\nmy views I assume the entire responsibility.\n\u0007 The work involved in the long-standing studies reported here took me away from some\nfamily duties. For the evinced agreement as well as for the permanent aid I am deeply\nindebted to all my family.\n\u0007 In the end I mention that the research reported here was finalized with a partial\nsupport from the Roumanian Ministry of National Education under a grant.\n\n72\n\n\fLIST OF ACRONYMS\n\nCR\n\ncorrelation relation(s)\n\nHR\n\nHeisenberg's relation(s)\n\nP\n\npoint\n\nP.../A\n\nassertion point\n\nP.../M\n\nmotivation point\n\nQCL\n\nquantum\u2212\u2192classical limit\n\nQTP\n\nquantum torsion pendulum\n\nSRTE\n\nsuper-resolution thought experiment(s/al)\n\nTE\n\nthought experiment(s/al)\n\nTIHR\n\ntraditional interpretation of Heisenberg's relations\n\n73\n\n\fREFERENCES\nAharonov Y. and Bohm D., 1961, Phys.
