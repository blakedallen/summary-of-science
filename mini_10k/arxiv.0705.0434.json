Our analysis thus unmasks the true, shortranged nature of the magnetic properties of the LiHox Y1\u2212x F4 system, validating recent theoretical\ninvestigations suggesting the lack of phase transition in this system.\nPACS numbers: 75.50.Lk, 75.10.Nr, 75.40.Cx\n\nThe system LiHox Y1\u2212x F4 (x \u2264 0.25) in a transverse\nfield has been considered as the textbook example of the\nrealization of the quantum Ising spin-glass model[1, 2].\nIndeed, a huge uniaxial crystal-field anisotropy gives\na strong Ising character to the system, and dipolar[3]\ninteractions between Ho3+ ions insure the presence of\nmagnetic couplings of different signs. Furthermore, this\nglassy system can be obtained in the form of high quality single crystals where Ho3+ ions randomly substitute\nY3+ ones without any modification of the structure (body\ncentered tetragonal lattice with scheelite structure, space\ngroup I41 /a[4]), so that its intrinsic static and dynamical\nmagnetic properties can be investigated. The quantum\nand classical spin-glass transitions of these Ho:LiYF4 alloys (with or without transverse field) have been extensively studied in the past, particularly for x = 0.167 and\n0.045[1, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However, the divergence of the nonlinear susceptibility \u03c7nl [9] confirming the occurrence of\nthe spin-glass phase transition and allowing the determination of the spin-glass critical exponent \u03b3 [10, 11], has\nnever been analyzed in detail. This sceptical view is also\nsupported by the fact that the ferromagnetic correlation\nlength of the much simpler LiHoF4 in a transverse field\nis dramatically quenched by hyperfine interaction of the\nHo3+ ions[12]. The generic influence of these interactions\non the quantum dynamics of Ho:LiYF4 has been previously demonstrated[13].\nRecent theoretical developments predict that due to\nthe presence of off-diagonal hyperfine[14] and dipolar[14,\n15, 16, 17] terms, the Hamiltonian becomes equivalent\nto that of a ferromagnet with random fields. This is\nparticularly true at low, but non-zero, transverse field\nwhere quantum fluctuations are small while the effective\nrandom field can be appreciable[18].\nIn this letter, we show that the linear and non-\n\nlinear susceptibility of high-quality single crystals of\nLiHox Y1\u2212x F4 with x = 0.165 and 0.045, accurately determined from micro-SQUID measurements, does not diverge in the presence nor in the absence of a transverse\nfield, showing that this system is neither a ferromagnet\nnor a spin-glass, in the classical or quantum regimes. Although the possibility of a zero Kelvin transition cannot\nbe excluded, a simple, non-critical, model is proposed to\ndepict the magnetic behavior of the low-doped Ho:LiYF4\ncrystals.\nHigh-quality LiHox Y1\u2212x F4 crystals with x = 0.165\nand 0.045 were grown in platinum crucibles by the\nCzochralski method[19]. The Holmium concentration\nwas accurately determined by x-ray spectral analysis\nwith a CAMEBAX electron-probe micro-analyzer. The\nmagnetization measurements were performed on the\nmicro-SQUID magnetometer[20], between 0.035 K and\n0.5K in longitudinal or transverse fields up to 0.5 T.\nThe size of the crystals (330 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 500 \u03bcm3 for the\n16.5% doped) and the field sweep rates (1\u201350 Oe/s) were\nsmall enough to maximize thermal contact and equilibrium with the cryostat. The longest axis of the crystals\ncorresponds to the c-axis, which is the easy axis of the\nmagnetization M . Additional measurements were performed on a conventional SQUID magnetometer for reference.\nThe M (H) curves of LiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 , measured with\nthe field H applied along the easy c-axis at temperatures between 35 and 600 mK, saturate at 6.52 \u03bcb /Ho.\nThey are hysteretic at low temperatures with a weak Slike shape (see top panel of Fig. 1) suggesting residual\nphonon bottleneck[21], while above 0.18 K they are fully\nreversible. As seen in the inset, the inverse susceptibility displays a linear T -dependence with a paramagnetic\nCurie temperature \u03b8 = 0.42 K, indicating that ferro-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Top panel: Hysteresis loop of\nLiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 measured along the easy c-axis at the temperature T = 35 mK at the sweep rate of 35 Oe/s. The insert\nshows the T -dependence of the inverse susceptibility H/M\nmeasured in H=1000 Oe on a conventional SQUID magnetometer. Bottom panel: Temperature dependence of the initial susceptibility \u03c71 of M (H) curves for different superimposed transverse magnetic fields HT\n\nmagnetic interactions are dominant. Note that a rough\nevaluation of dipolar interactions yields an energy scale\n\u223c 0.5 K.\nThe linear susceptibility \u03c71 [9] exhibits a broad maximum near 0.16 K, at which \u03c71 amounts to \u223c 0.41\nemu/cm3 /Oe (see Fig. 1). This value is not very different from the inverse demagnetization factor of the crystal (shaped as a rectangular prism with the longest dimension parallel to the c-axis) 1/N \u223c 0.66. Yet, it is\nneither much smaller nor comparable to 1/N , as this is\nrespectively expected for canonical spin-glasses and ferromagnets. There might thus not exist any long-ranged\nmagnetic order in LiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 . In the presence of a\ntransverse field, \u03c71 is slightly suppressed, unless the field\nbecomes large. This conventional behavior confirms the\nabsence of ferromagnetic phase transition in this system\nin zero and finite HT .\nIn order to investigate the effect of temperature and\ntransverse field on the non-linear susceptibility, \u03c7nl =\n\u03c71 \u2212 M/H is plotted as a function of H 2 , as shown in\nFig. 2 (top panel). This allows us to estimate the lowest order term of \u03c7nl , \u03c73 , for different transverse fields\n(see Fig. 2, top panel). Unlike \u03c71 , \u03c73 is greatly affected\nby small transverse fields (< 70 mT) and is suppressed\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Top panels: measured M (H) curves\nor LiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 at selected temperatures (left) and corresponding non-linear susceptibility \u03c7nl = \u03c71 \u2212 M/H plotted\nas a function of H 2 for HT =0 and T = 0.2-0.32 K; the initial slopes taken to derive the \u03c73 are indicated by thick lines\nand the dotted line marks the largest H 2 values which are\nconsidered (right). Bottom panel: temperature dependence\nof \u03c73 for different transverse fields HT . Note that \u03c71 and \u03c73\nare correctly determined only in the reversible region which\nis, more or less, above the peak in \u03c71 . In the low temperature\nside the ascending and descending branches of the hysteresis loops were averaged in order to approach the metastable\nequilibrium M (H) curve. The inset displays a HT -T diagram\nwhere the Tmax is the temperature at which the maximum of\n\u2212\u03c73 occurs. Dotted lines are only guides to the eye.\n\nat larger fields. In zero transverse field, \u03c73 (T ) exhibits a\nrather sharp peak, as seem in Fig. 2 (lower panel). Wu et\nal[6], who also measured this peak, attributed this sharpness to the divergence of the spin-glass phase transition.\nDespite the suppression of \u03c73 , the same conclusion was\nreached in the presence of a transverse fields. In their\nanalysis, these authors assumed that Tg corresponds to\nthe susceptibility peak and they erroneously[22] used all\nthe data points available above this temperature, even\nthose where dynamical effects are present, within the\npeak rounding. In order to clarify this controversial situation, the critical T -dependence of \u03c73 should be analyzed\nwithout making any assumption on the value of Tg and\nat temperatures slightly above the peak, where \u03c73 is fully\nreversible.\nPhase transition theories and experimental studies of\nthe spin-glass phase transition show that \u03c73 should diverge as \u03c73 \u221d [(T \u2212 Tg )/T ]\u2212\u03b3 , where \u03b3 is a critical\nexponent[10, 11].

The plot of the\ndata according to this expression is roughly linear above\n\u223c 0.25K (where \u03c73 is fully reversible, see Fig. 3, top\nleft panel). However, the positive slope gives unphysical\nnegative \u03b3 and much too large Tg . Another, slightly improved expression in which \u03c73 vanishes at high temperatures was also considered: \u03c73 = \u03c73 (0).([(T \u2212 Tg )/T ]\u2212\u03b3 \u2212\n1). The corresponding dT /[T.d log(\u03c73 /\u03c73 (0) + 1)] was\nplotted vs T for all possible values of \u03c73 (0). When\nthis parameter increases, the slope becomes progressively\npositive, but the linearity is lost unless \u03b3 is very large\n(\u03b3=13.6 and Tg =0.06 K, as exemplified in Fig. 3, top\nright panel). As the fits based on both expressions, performed without any assumption on Tg , lead to unphysical\nresults, we conclude to the absence of a spin-glass phase\ntransition at finite Tg in LiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 . The evolution of the maximum of \u03c73 (T ) with HT shown in Fig. 2\n(lower panel), shows clearly the suppression of \u03c73 . A similar suppression was observed in another series of experiments (not shown) using smaller transverse fields. They\nboth confirm that the maximum value of \u03c73 remains finite in zero applied HT . According to the present study,\nthe line Tg vs HT shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (lower\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Main frames: Temperature dependence of the linear and non-linear susceptibilities \u03c71 and\n\u03c73 for (left) LiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 and (right) LiHo0.045 Y0.955 F4\nwithout transverse field. The continuous lines represent\nexp(\u2212T /T0 ) fits (see main text), obtained from the T -linear\nfits of log(\u03c71 )) and log(\u03c73 )) shown in the insets of each panel.\n\npanel), is not critical and may simply represent a crossover between blocked and reversible magnetization when\nthermal and quantum fluctuations are of the order of long\nrange dipolar interactions (see below).\nNext we investigate the possibility of a phase transition\nat Tg = 0. A first order expansion of the logarithm of\nthe above form, \u03c73 = \u03c73 (0).([(T \u2212 Tg )/T ]\u2212\u03b3 \u2212 1), was\nperformed for Tg /T << 1. This yields the characteristic\nexponential divergence of zero-Kelvin phase transitions:\nlog(\u03c73 /\u03c73 (0) + 1) = \u03b3Tg /T . Plots of the data according\nto log(\u03c73 /\u03c73 (0) + 1) with 1/T are poorly linear for any\nvalue of \u03c73 (0), except may be for \u03c73 (0) \u223c 10\u22129 where a\nrather small linear portion extrapolates to (0,0), as seen\nin Fig. 3. This suggests that even a zero-Kelvin phase\ntransition is questionable in LiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 . However\none cannot totally exclude it.\nIn order to define the magnetic behavior of the system,\none may consider the following, very simple, non-critical\napproach in which the time-dependent magnetization results from the integration of a uniform distribution of\nenergy barriers with anR exponential cut-off at largest\nenergies EM , as M = exp[\u2212y(E)]dE, where y(E) =\n(t/\u03c40 ) exp(\u2212E/kB T ) + E/EM . Maximizing the rate of\nmagnetization reversal (dy(E)/dE=0) gives the most effective energy scale Eeff = kB T log[(EM /kB T ).(t/\u03c40 )] (\u223c\n30 kB T for quasi-static measurements). This implies\nthat Mmax \u223c exp(\u2212ymax ) \u223c exp(\u2212T /T0 ) where T0 \u223c\n\n\f4\nEM /(30kB ) represents the measured magnetization. As\nthe magnetic field does not enter explicitly in this expression, it should describe both linear and non-linear\nsusceptibilities (albeit may be with different T0 ). The T linear fits of log(\u03c71 ) and log(\u03c73 ) and resulting \u03c71 (T ) and\n\u03c73 (T ) curves are excellent, as seen in Fig. 4 (left panels). Thus \u03c71 and \u03c73 appear to follow the above derived\nM \u223c exp(\u2212T /T0) form with T0 \u223c 0.31 K and 0.063 K\nrespectively.\nSimilar experiments were also performed on a crystal\nwith lower Ho doping (4.5 %), i.e. LiHo0.045 Y0.955 F4 .\nExcept for a temperature shift of the \u03c73 (T ) curve in the\nsame ratio as the concentrations, the magnetic behavior\nof this sample was found to be identical to that of the 16.5\n% sample: The maximum value of \u03c71 is slightly smaller\nthan 1/N ; \u03c73 (T ) does not diverge at finite temperature\nand is suppressed by a transverse field: scaling plots of\nthe type shown in Fig. 3 are also rather poor, indicating\nthe lack of phase transition also in this case. As seen\nin Fig. 4 (right panels) exp(\u2212T /T0 ) fits are excellent for\nboth \u03c71 (T ) and \u03c73 (T ) suggesting as for the 16.5 % sample, a simple and conventional behavior determined by\nthe highest energy scales. The corresponding values of\nT0 are respectively \u223c 0.18 K and 0.043 K, i.e. almost the\nsame as for LiHo0.165 Y0.835 F4 . The energy scale EM \u223c\n30 kB T0 , being independent on the concentration, should\nalso be independent of the strength of dipolar interactions. This is not surprising because the relevant energy\nscale is here determined by hyperfine interactions rather\nthan by dipolar interactions. Indeed, the only way for the\nmagnetization to switch is by thermally activated tunneling on electro-nuclear states distributed over the hyperfine energy, suggesting that EM \u223c 1.8 K. This value is\nclose to the one derived from the concentration independent T0 extracted from the \u03c73 (T ) curves of both samples,\nwhich is EM \u223c 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 K on average. However the energy derived from the fit of \u03c71 (T ) is significantly larger\n(7 \u00b1 2 K), showing the limits of our simple model.\nIn conclusion, accurate magnetization measurements\nperformed on single crystals of LiHox Y1\u2212x F4 with\nx=16.5% and x=4.5% down to 35 mK and their analysis show that both compositions have the same behavior: (i) absence of spin-glass phase transition in a transverse field, as predicted recently[14, 15, 16, 17, 18], (ii)\nsame absence of phase transition without transverse field\nas well, at finite temperature; (iii) at zero Kelvin the\nnon-linear susceptibility may be divergent, although the\nexcellent fits of the linear and non-linear susceptibilities of the exp(\u2212T /T0 ) form tend to suggest ordinary\nthermally activated dynamics in the quantum regime,\nwith log(M ) = \u2212T f (H, T ) (f is a functional form).\nOne should note that for low Ho concentrations, WangLandau Monte Carlo simulations have predicted a spinglass transition at zero Kelvin only[15]. The lack of phase\ntransition at finite temperature (and may be at zero\nKelvin as well) should be associated with the disorder\n\ninherent to long-ranged dipolar interactions in a diluted\nsystem with strong hyperfine interactions. All these finding are in good agreement with recent theoretical and\nexperimental investigations[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23], and\nin sharp contrast with earlier studies of LiHox Y1\u2212x F4 [5,\n6, 7, 8]. In particular, the the existence of the so-called\nantiglass state in the x = 0.045 sample [5] may now be\nquestioned since both the specific heat [23] and magnetization (this work) data do not show any marked difference between the x = 0.16 and x = 0.045 samples.\nWe thank J.
