Phys. A: Math. Gen. , QFEXT'07 special issue\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Casimir force [1] is a remarkable prediction of quantum field theory. As the most\neasily accessible effect of vacuum fluctuations in the macroscopic world, it deserves\ncareful experimental tests [2, 3, 4]. After tests which confirmed its existence and main\nproperties [5], experiments have been largely improved by technological achievements\nmastered over the last decade [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Meanwhile, it was realized that\nthe Casimir force, a dominant force at micron or sub-micron distances, was clearly an\nimportant aspect of the study of micro- and nano-oscillators (MEMS, NEMS) [14, 15].\nThese recent advances have been reviewed in a number of papers, for example\n[16, 17, 18] and in a special issue of the New Journal of Physics [19]. In the next\nparagraphs, we emphasize arguments which plead for careful comparisons between\nexperimental measurements and theoretical predictions of the Casimir force [20].\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n2\n\nWhy testing the Casimir force\nA precise knowledge of the Casimir force is a key point for the tests of gravity at\nsub-millimeter ranges [21, 22, 23]. A strong constraint has been obtained recently in\nshort range Cavendish-like experiments [24]. Should an hypothetical new force have\na Yukawa-like form, its strength could not be larger than that of gravity for Yukawa\nranges larger than 56 \u03bcm.\nTests performed at shorter ranges essentially amount to comparisons with theory\nof Casimir force measurements. In other words, the looked for hypothetical new\nforce would correspond to an observable given by the difference Fexp \u2212 Fth between\nexperiment and theory. This implies that the theoretical prediction Fth and the\nexperimental measurement Fexp have to be treated independently from each other\nand with the same accuracy and reliability requirements.\nTo sum up the argument, the fact that Casimir force experiments could be a\nwindow on hypothetical deviations from standard physics forbids one to use theoryexperiment comparison as an argument for proving (or disproving) some specific\nexperiment or theoretical model. In this context, it is important to use a theoretical\nformalism having the ability to take into account the significant differences between\nthe real experimental conditions and the ideal situation studied by Casimir [4, 17, 20].\nCasimir calculated the force between a pair of perfectly smooth, flat and parallel\nplates in the limit of zero temperature and perfect reflection. He found expressions\nfor the force FCas and energy ECas which only depend on the distance L, the area A\nand two fundamental constants, the speed of light c and Planck constant h\u0304\ndECas\nh\u0304c\u03c0 2 A\nh\u0304c\u03c0 2 A\n=\n(1)\n,\nE\n=\n\u2212\nCas\n240L4\ndL\n720L3\nThis universality property of the Casimir expression is related to the assumption\nof perfect reflection that is also to the saturation of the optical response of the\nmirrors when they reflect 100% of the incoming light. However, no real mirror can be\nconsidered as a perfect reflector at all field frequencies. The most precise experiments\nare performed with metallic mirrors which are good reflectors only at frequencies\nsmaller than their plasma frequency. It follows that the Casimir force can obey the\nCasimir expression only at distances L larger than the plasma wavelength \u03bbP .\nAs this effect of imperfect reflection is large, a precise knowledge of its frequency\ndependence is essential for obtaining an accurate theoretical prediction of the Casimir\nforce [25]. This is also true for another correction to the ideal Casimir formula\nassociated with temperature effect. For discussions of this effect, we refer to discussions\nin [26, 27] and the recent review [28]. We focus now our attention on the effects of\ngeometry which are also important in this context.\nFCas =\n\nWhy testing the effects of geometry\nIt has been repeatedly stated over the years that the connection between the Casimir\neffect and geometry should show a rich variety of sensitive dependences [30, 31, 32].\nThe basis for this statement is the important fact that the Casimir forces cannot be\nadditive, except in the specific case of interaction between very dilute media.\nMeanwhile, most experiments are performed between a plane and a sphere with\nthe Casimir force in this geometry calculated using the Proximity Force Approximation\n[33], though the latter amounts to a mere averaging over the distribution of local interplate distances. The PFA is expected to be valid in the plane-sphere geometry when\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n3\n\nthe radius R is much larger than the separation L [34, 35] and it is used to analyze\nmost present day experiments. Results going beyond this approximation have been\nobtained recently [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Some of these theoretical\nmodels involve scalar fields reflected on perfect boundary conditions and can hardly\nbe compared with experiments but those dealing with electromagnetic fields have now\nto be used for comparisons with experimental results obtained in the plane-sphere\ngeometry.\nAs the effects of geometry on the Casimir force open access to a rich and\nstimulating physics, it is also important to explore this domain through new dedicated\nexperiments. Only a few experiments have been designed to this aim which use a\nspecific geometry with periodic corrugations imprinted on metallic surfaces. In this\ncase, the Casimir force contains a lateral component since lateral translation symmetry\nis broken [46]. The lateral Casimir force is smaller than the normal one, but it has\nnevertheless already been measured in experiments [47]. The results have been found\nto agree within a bar of \u00b124% with PFA calculations.\nCalculations beyond the PFA have also been performed by using more elaborate\ntheoretical methods. The lateral force has been evaluated for perfectly reflecting\nmirrors using a path-integral formulation in a perturbative [48] or non perturbative\napproach [49]. As the experiments are performed at distances L not much larger than\nthe plasma wavelength \u03bbP , it is essential to account for the optical properties of the\nmetals [25, 26]. Below we will present results obtained for corrugated metallic mirrors\nin the limiting case where the corrugation can be treated as a small perturbation\n[50, 51, 52]. As expected, the PFA is found to be valid when the corrugated surfaces\nappear as nearly plane to the vacuum fields involved in the calculation of the Casimir\nenergy, that is to say when the corrugation wavelength \u03bbC is larger than the other\nrelevant length scales.\nOutline of the paper\nWe review below the theory of Casimir effect within scattering theory. We will in\nparticular present the formula giving the (QED) theoretical prediction for the Casimir\nforce between scatterers placed in vacuum, or more generally at thermodynamical\nequilibrium with T 6= 0. This formula has been written years ago for plane and\nparallel mirrors showing specular reflection [53]. It has been used to discuss in a\nqualitative manner the effect of reflection properties of the mirrors on the Casimir\nforce [17, 25, 26, 54]. Its applicability domain has been enlarged up to the point where\nit is now capable of dealing with non planar geometries with non specular reflection\nmixing field polarizations and transverse wave-vectors [20]. We will recall below the\napplication of this method to the calculation of the lateral Casimir force between\ncorrugated plates [51, 52].\nNote that similar discussions have been devoted to the discussion of the effect of\nsurface roughness on the Casimir force. This description is commonly given within\nthe PFA [55] which cannot remain valid for arbitrary roughness wavelengths [56].\nAs the effect of roughness is only a small correction of the Casimir force, one can\nhowever hardly expect quantitative theory-experiment comparisons in this case. This\nis why we will not discuss it below. Other applications have also been presented for\nthe Casimir torque appearing between misaligned corrugation plates [57] and for the\nCasimir-Polder force between an atom or a cloud of atoms (BEC) and a corrugated\nmetallic plate [58].\n\n\f4\n\nCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n2. Specular scattering\n\nWe first consider the geometry with perfectly plane and parallel mirrors aligned along\nthe directions x and y. As the configuration obeys a symmetry with respect to\ntime translation as well as lateral space translations (along directions x and y), the\nfrequency \u03c9, transverse vector k \u2261 (kx , ky ) and polarization p = TE, TM are preserved\nby the scattering processes which couple field modes having the same values for the\npreserved quantum numbers but a different sign for the longitudinal wavevector kz .\nThe two mirrors j = 1, 2 are described by reflection and transmission amplitudes\nwhich depend on frequency, incidence angle \u03b8 = arccos (ckz /\u03c9) and polarization p.\nScattering formulas\nThe important result is that the Casimir force can be written in terms of the reflection\namplitudes rj of the two mirrors, as seen from inside the Fabry-Perot cavity formed\nby the two mirrors [53]. In order to write this relation, we introduce two functions\nwhich characterize the optical response of the cavity to an input field (dependences\nwith respect to \u03c9, k and p are omitted)\nf=\n\nr1 r2 e2ikz L\n1 \u2212 r1 r2 e2ikz L\n\n,\n\ng = 1 + f + f\u2217 =\n\n1 \u2212 r1 r2 e2ikz L\n\n2\n\n|1 \u2212 r1 r2 e2ikz L |\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\nf is the closed-loop function describing the cavity (L is the length of the cavity) and,\ntherefore, obeys analyticity properties. Meanwhile g is the ratio of energy inside the\ncavity to energy outside the cavity, that is also the ratio of spectral density inside\nthe cavity to spectral density outside the cavity for a given mode. Its expression\nis valid for lossy as well as lossless mirrors as was demonstrated with an increasing\nrange of validity in [53], [59] and [54]. For lossy mirrors, it accounts for the additional\nfluctuations accompanying losses inside the mirrors.\nAssuming thermal equilibrium for the whole \"cavity + fields\" system, we obtain\nthe radiation pressure exerted by the field fluctuations upon the mirrors. This leads\nto the following expression of the Casimir force as the sum over all field modes m of\nthis radiation pressure (m gathers the parameters \u03c9, k and p)\n\u0013\nX \u00121\nF =\n+ n h\u0304\u03c9 cos2 \u03b8 {1 \u2212 g}\n2\nm\n\u0013\nX \u00121\n+ n h\u0304\u03c9 cos2 \u03b8 {f + f \u2217 }\n= \u2212\n(3)\n2\nm\n\u0001\nHere 12 + n h\u0304\u03c9 is the mean energy per mode at temperature T with n the mean\nnumber of photons per mode (n = 0 at T = 0, n > 0 otherwise)\n1\nh\u0304\u03c9\n1\n+ n = coth\n2\n2\n2kB T\n\n(4)\n\nMeanwhile cos2 \u03b8 is a projection factor appearing in the translation from energy density\nto pressure; finally {1 \u2212 g} represents the difference between pressures on the outer\nand inner sides of the mirrors respectively. Equation (3) contains the contribution\nof ordinary modes freely propagating outside and inside the cavity (\u03c9 > c|k|), which\nmerely reflects the intuitive picture of a radiation pressure of field fluctuations on the\nmirrors [53]. But it also includes the contribution of evanescent waves (\u03c9 < c|k|)\nwhich propagate inside the mirrors with an incidence angle larger than the limit angle\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n5\n\n[54]. The properties of the latter are described through an analytical continuation of\nthose of ordinary waves, using the well defined analytic behavior of the function f .\nEquation (3) can be equivalently written as a differential with respect to length\nof a free energy\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 r1 r2 e2ikz L\n\u2202F\nh\u0304c X 1\nF =\n(5)\n, F=\n+ n ln\n\u2202L\ni m 2\n1 \u2212 r1\u2217 r2\u2217 e\u22122ikz L\nUsing analyticity properties, as well as high frequency transparency to neglect the\ncontribution of large frequencies, both equations (3) and (5) can be transformed into\nintegral over imaginary frequencies \u03c9 = i\u03be. We will write below more general forms\nof these relations, valid also for non specular scattering.\nThe Lifshitz formula as a particular case\nEquations (3) and (5) reproduce the Casimir formulas (1) in the limits of perfect\nreflection r1 r2 \u2192 1 and null temperature T \u2192 0. They are regular for any optical\nmodel of mirrors obeying causality and high frequency transparency properties,\nwithout needing any further regularization. They can thus be used for calculating\nthe Casimir force between arbitrary mirrors, as soon as the reflection amplitudes\nare specified. These amplitudes are commonly deduced from microscopic models of\nmirrors, the simplest of which is the well known Lifshitz model [60].\nThis model corresponds to plates having a large optical thickness, and\ncharacterized by a local dielectric function \u03b5 (\u03c9). The reflection amplitudes are thus\ngiven by the Fresnel law written at the vacuum-bulk interface\nKz \u2212 \u03b5kz\nkz \u2212 Kz\n, rTM =\nrTE =\nk + Kz\nKz + \u03b5kz\np\npz\n(6)\nckz = \u03c9 2 \u2212 c2 kz2 , cKz = \u03b5\u03c9 2 \u2212 c2 kz2\nkz and Kz correspond to the longitudinal wavevector in vacuum and in the bulk\nrespectively. Taken with equations (3) and (5) (possibly translated to the domain of\nimaginary frequencies), these relations (6) reproduce the Lifshitz expression for the\nCasimir force [60]. The latter tend to the original Casimir expression in the limit\n\u03b5 \u2192 \u221e which produces perfectly reflecting mirrors [61].\nAt this stage, several remarks are worth being emphasized :\n\n\u2022 The expression of the force was not written in this manner by Lifshitz. To our\nbest knowledge, Kats [62] was the first to notice that Lifshitz expression could be\nwritten in terms of the reflection amplitudes.\n\u2022 The Lifshitz expression is valid for the cases for which it was derived. Its\nextension to more general situations can only be considered as valid after a careful\nexamination of the derivation.\n\u2022 In the most general case, the optical response of the bulk material cannot be\ndescribed by a local dielectric function. In this case, the description in terms of\nreflection amplitudes, which necessarily differ from the specific expressions (6), is\nstill valid [53, 54, 20].\nDescription of real mirrors\nIn order to obtain a quantitative description of the effect of finite conductivity, we may\nin a first approach use the expressions (6) with the dielectric function corresponding\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n6\n\nto the plasma model (\u03c9P the plasma frequency)\n2\n2\n\u03c9P\n\u03c9P\n,\n\u03b5\n(i\u03be)\n=\n1\n+\n(7)\n\u03c92\n\u03be2\nWhen performing these calculations, one recovers as expected the Casimir formula at\nlarge distances (F \u2192 FCas when L \u226b \u03bbP ). At distances smaller than \u03bbP in contrast,\na significant reduction is obtained with the asymptotic law of variation read as\nF\nL\nL \u226a \u03bbP \u2192\n\u2243 1.193\n(8)\nFCas\n\u03bbP\nThis can be understood as the result of the Coulomb interaction of surface plasmons\nat the two vacuum/metal interfaces [63, 64]. The generalization of this idea at\narbitrary distances is more subtle since it involves a full electromagnetic treatment\nof the plasmon as well as ordinary photon modes [65].\nThe plasma model cannot provide a fully satisfactory description of the optical\nresponse of metals. A more realistic representation of the metals includes the\ndescription of the relaxation processes of conduction electrons as well as that of\ninterband transitions. The reader is referred to [25] for a more detailed discussion\n[66]. The values of the complex index of refraction for different metals, measured\nthrough different optical techniques, are tabulated in several handbooks [67]. Optical\ndata may vary from one reference to another, leading to different estimations of the\nCasimir force [68]. Let us emphasize that the problem here is neither due to a lack of\nprecision of the calculations nor to inaccuracies in experiments. The problem is that\ncalculations and experiments may consider physical samples with different optical\nproperties. This difficulty should be solved by measuring the reflection amplitudes of\nthe mirrors used in the experiment and inserting these informations in the formula\ngiving the predicted Casimir force.\n\n\u03b5 (\u03c9) = 1 \u2212\n\nTemperature correction\nThe Casimir force between metallic mirrors at non zero temperature has given rise to\ncontradictory claims which have raised doubts about the theoretical expression of the\nforce. We do not repeat here the discussions which have been devoted to the topic\nin [26, 27, 20] (see also the recent review [28] and contributions on the topic in the\npresent volume [29]). We only want to stress again that the running controversy can\nonly be solved through an improvement of the knowledge of the reflection amplitudes,\nparticularly at low frequencies. As already discussed, the best manner to do that is\nto measure these amplitudes on the mirrors used in the experiment\n3. Non specular scattering\nWe will now present a more general formalism where the Casimir force and energy are\ncalculated between two objects with non planar shapes. This formalism is an extension\nof what has already been presented with the scattering amplitudes now accounting\nfor non-specular reflection. The non-specular case is of course the generic one while\nspecular reflection can only be an idealization. After an introduction to this general\nformalism, we will discuss applications to the lateral force between corrugated mirrors\nand we will in particular emphasize deviations from the PFA.\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n7\n\nGeneral scattering formulas\nIn order to introduce the general formalism, let us first rewrite expression (5) of the\nCasimir free energy between two parallel plane plates as the sum over modes\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n\u2202F\nd\u03c9 1\nF =\n, F = ih\u0304\n+ n ln det S\n\u2202L\n2\u03c0 2\n0\nd\u2217\n, d \u2261 1 \u2212 r1 r2 e2ikz L\n(9)\nln det S = Tr ln S = Tr ln\nd\nThese equations correspond to the following interpretation [53] : The force F is the\nchange of the free energy F when the scatterers are being displaced. The free energy\nF is described by a storage of vacuum energy due to the scattering process, and it\nis written in terms of the S-matrix associated with the cavity. As the scattering on\nstationary objects preserves frequency, this S-matrix is defined at a given value of\n\u03c9. As the surfaces are plane and parallel, the scattering also preserves the transverse\nwavevector k and polarization p (it only couples modes with opposite values of the\nlongitudinal wavevector). The symbol Tr in (9) refers to a trace over the modes\ncorresponding to different values of k and p at a fixed frequency. The quantity\nln det S can be written in terms of the matrix d which is diagonal on the basis of plane\nwaves, so that equation (9) is effectively equivalent to (5). This \"scattering formula\"\nor \"phaseshift formula\" [53] can equivalently be written as a sum over imaginary\nfrequencies \u03c9 = i\u03be\nZ \u221e\nd\u03be\nF = h\u0304\n(10)\n(1 + 2n) ln det d\n2\u03c0\n0\n\u0010 p\n\u0011\nd \u2261 1 \u2212 r1 r2 exp \u22122 k2 + \u03be 2 L\nd is the denominator of the loop function (2) here written for imaginary frequencies.\nAs a consequence of this interpretation, it is clear that a more general formula\nof the Casimir energy can be written in a similar manner for the case of stationary\nbut non-specular scattering [50, 20]. It can be expressed either as a sum over real\nfrequencies, including ordinary and evanescent waves, or as a sum over imaginary\nfrequencies\nZ \u221e\nd\u03be\n(11)\nF = h\u0304\n(1 + 2n) ln det D\n2\u03c0\n0\nD \u2261 1 \u2212 R1 exp (\u2212KL) R2 exp (\u2212KL)\n\nThe matrices D, R1 and R2 are no longer diagonal on the basis of plane waves since\nthey describe non specular reflection on the two mirrors. The propagation factors\ncontained in K remain diagonal on the basis of plane waves with their diagonal values\nwritten as in (10). Clearly the expression (11) does not depend on the choice of this\nspecific basis. Note that the matrices in (11) do not commute with each other. In\nparticular, the two propagation matrices exp (\u2212KL) appearing in D can be moved\nthrough circular permutations in the product but not adjoined to each other.\nThis equation takes a simpler form at the limit of null temperature (note the\nchange of notation from the free energy F to the ordinary energy E)\nZ \u221e\ndE\nd\u03be\nF =\n, E = h\u0304\nln det D\n(12)\ndL\n2\u03c0\n0\nFormula (12) has already been used to evaluate the effect of roughness [50] or\ncorrugation [51, 52] of the mirrors. To this aim, it was dealt with in a perturbative\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n8\n\nmanner at second order in the roughness or corrugation amplitudes, recalled in the\nforthcoming paragraphs. It is clear that it has a larger domain of application, not\nlimited to the perturbative regime, as soon as some technique is available for exploiting\nits general form for specific problems of physical interest. Such a technique has been\ndeveloped recently by Emig, Graham, Jaffe and Kardar [42], through a multipole\nexpansion well adapted to the treatment of \"compact\" objects, typically two spheres\nnot too close to each other. The general formula used as the starting point of the\nexpansion is equivalent to our formula (12) with D given in (11). In particular, the\nT \u2212matrices in [42] are identified as the non-specular reflection matrices R of [50].\nMeanwhile the U \u2212matrices in [42] correspond to the propagation matrices exp (\u2212KL)\nof [50], the difference in their explicit expression arising from the fact that they are\nwritten in different basis.\nScattering formula for the lateral Casimir force\nWe now come to the discussion of the effect of non-planar geometries and particularly\nof the deviation from the PFA which could be seen in experiments. As already\nstated, we thus focus our attention on the lateral Casimir force appearing between\ncorrugated plates. In this case, the deviation of PFA should indeed be visible as\na factor in front of the whole effect. This situation is clearly more favorable to\ntheory/experiment comparison than that met when studying the roughness correction\nto the normal Casimir force, with this correction being only a small part of the\nforce [50]. Stated differently, the lateral Casimir force could allow for a new test\nof a prediction of Quantum ElectroDynamics, namely the dependence with respect to\ncorrugation wavevector discussed below [51, 52].\nHere, we consider two parallel plane mirrors, M1 and M2, with corrugated surfaces\ndescribed by uniaxial sinusoidal profiles (see Fig. 1 in [52])\n2\u03c0\n(13)\nh1 = a1 cos(kC x) , h2 = a2 cos (kC (x \u2212 b)) , kC =\n\u03bbC\nThe functions h1 (x, y) and h2 (x, y) measure the local height with respect to mean\nplanes z1 = 0 and z2 = L. They are defined so that h1 and h2 have null spatial\naverages, L thus representing the mean distance between the two surfaces; h1 and h2\nare both counted as positive when they correspond to separation decreases; \u03bbC is the\ncorrugation wavelength, kC the corresponding wave vector, and b the spatial mismatch\nbetween the corrugation crests.\nIn the following, we will suppose that the corrugation amplitudes are smaller than\nthe other length scales, namely the corrugation wavelength \u03bbC , the plasma wavelength\n\u03bbP and the interplate distance L\na1 , a2 \u226a \u03bbC , \u03bbP , L\n\n(14)\n\nUsing the PFA, the Casimir energy is thus obtained by adding the contributions of\nvarious surface elements calculated for distributed local distances. Using the condition\n(14) and expanding up to second order in the corrugation amplitudes, we find the\nlowest-order correction to energy within the PFA\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2202 2 EPP a21 + a22\n+ a1 a2 cos(kC b)\n(15)\n\u03b4EPFA =\n2 \u2202L2\n2\nwith EPP the energy calculated between two parallel plane plates. As the energy\ncorrections proportional to a21 and a22 do not depend on the lateral mismatch b, they\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n9\n\ndo not contribute to the lateral force which is simply read as\n1 \u2202 2 EPP\n\u2202\u03b4EPFA\nkC a1 a2 sin(kC b)\n(16)\n=\n\u2202b\n2 \u2202L2\nWe will now write the scattering formula for the lateral Casimir force, in a perturbative\nexpansion with respect to the corrugation amplitudes. As in (16), the correction of the\nCasimir energy will arise at second order in the corrugation amplitudes, with crossed\nterms of the form a1 a2 which have the ability to induce lateral forces. The main\ndifference with (15,16) will be the appearance of a more complicated dependence in\nthe corrugation wavevector kC .\nFor this purpose, we expand the non-specular reflection matrix Rj as the sum\n(0)\nRj + \u03b4Rj of a zero-th order contribution identified as the specular reflection and of a\nfirst-order contribution induced by the reflection on the corrugation [50]. The lowest\norder modification of the Casimir energy (12) able to produce a lateral force (cross\nterms \u221d a1 a2 ) is thus read as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nd\u03be\nexp (\u2212KL)\nexp (\u2212KL)\n\u03b4E = \u2212h\u0304\nTr\n(17)\n\u03b4R1\n\u03b4R2\n2\u03c0\nD(0)\nD(0)\n0\nlat\nFPFA\n=\u2212\n\nD(0) is the matrix D evaluated at zeroth order in the corrugation. It is diagonal on\nthe basis of plane waves and therefore commutes with K.\nExplicit results for the plasma model\nIn order to obtain explicit expressions, it is then necessary to use some microscopic\nmodel. To this aim, we study the case of bulk metallic plates described by the plasma\ndielectric function. The non specular reflection amplitudes are then calculated in\nthe Rayleigh approximation using techniques which have been developed for treating\nscattering on rough plates [69, 70]. We want to emphasize that this microscopic model\nallows one to calculate the lateral Casimir force for arbitrary relative values of the three\nparameters \u03bbP , \u03bbC and L, the corrugation amplitudes remaining the smallest length\nscale for perturbation theory to hold (see conditions 14).\nThis calculation leads to the following expression of the lateral Casimir force\nA\n\u2202\u03b4E\n, \u03b4E = GC (kC )a1 a2 cos(kC b)\n(18)\nF lat = \u2212\n\u2202b\n2\nwith the function GC (kC ) calculated in [52]. It is worth emphasizing that the PFA is\nrecovered in equation (18) as the limiting case kC \u2192 0, that is also for long corrugation\nwavelengths. This follows from a properly formulated \"Proximity Force Theorem\"\nd2 EPP\n(19)\nkC \u21920\ndL2\nThis property is ensured, for any model of the material medium, by the fact that\nGC (kC \u2192 0) is given by the specular limit of non specular reflection amplitudes [52].\nThis theorem has to be distinguished from the approximation (PFA) which consists in\nan identification between GC (kC ) and its limiting value GC (0). For arbitrary values\nof kC , the deviation from the PFA is described by the ratio\nlim AGC (kC ) =\n\n\u03c1C (kC ) =\n\nGC (kC )\nGC (0)\n\n(20)\n\nThe variation of this ratio \u03c1C with the various parameters has been described in a\ndetailed manner in [51, 52]. Some curves are drawn as examples in the Fig. 1 of [51]\n\n\fCasimir energy and geometry beyond the PFA\n\n10\n\nwith \u03bbP = 137nm chosen to fit the case of gold covered plates. An important feature\nis that \u03c1C is smaller than unity as soon as kC significantly deviates from 0. For large\nvalues of kC , it even decays exponentially to zero.\n4. Concluding remarks\nWe have studied the lateral Casimir force between two corrugated metallic plates.\nTo this aim, we have used a general scattering formula in a perturbative regime\ncorresponding to corrugation amplitudes smaller than the other length scales L, \u03bbC\nand \u03bbP . The result describes a variety of situations where these three scales have\narbitrary relative values. The results known for perfect mirrors [49] are recovered\nwhen \u03bbP \u226a \u03bbC , L. The Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) is recovered at the\nlimit of smooth plates L, \u03bbP \u226a \u03bbC . A third limiting case has been studied in [52]\nwhich corresponds to the opposite case of rugged corrugations \u03bbC \u226a L, \u03bbP . This case\ncorresponds to evaluations far beyond the PFA regime and is particularly interesting as\nit constitutes a non trivial interplay between geometry and the Casimir effect [32]. It is\nalso of great interest for applications to surfaces with structurations at the nanometric\nscale.\nThe numerical figures presented in [51, 52] suggest that non trivial effects of\ngeometry, i.e. effects beyond the PFA, could be observed with dedicated lateral force\nexperiments. Existing experiments by Chen et al [47] have used large corrugation\namplitudes a1 , a2 in order to increase the magnitude of the force. As they do not\nmeet the conditions of validity of our perturbative expansion, it is not possible to\ncompare directly the experimental and theoretical results. Chen et al have found their\nmeasurements to agree with PFA to within \u00b124%. Considering smaller amplitudes\na1 , a2 with the same values for the parameters L, \u03bbC and \u03bbP , we have obtained a\ndeviation from the PFA of the order of 40%, which means that these parameters do\nnot belong to the domain of validity of the PFA, at least at the perturbative limit.\nMore work is clearly needed in order to settle this potential concern in the theoryexperiment comparison [71, 72, 52]. Progress on this question could be achieved\nby calculating higher order corrections for metallic mirrors beyond the PFA. These\ncorrections would affect the theoretical predictions, but it seems unlikely that they\nwould compensate exactly the deviation from PFA which has been obtained in\nthe perturbative theory. Progress could alternatively come from experiments with\nsmaller corrugation amplitudes, allowing for a direct comparison with the perturbative\ntheory. A better experimental accuracy would also be very valuable, allowing one to\ndistinguish more easily between alternative predictions. Of course, this program raises\nserious experimental challenges, given the minuteness of the lateral force effect. But\nthe reward would be remarkable with potentially the first experimental demonstration\nof a nontrivial interplay between geometry and the Casimir effect.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank M.T.
