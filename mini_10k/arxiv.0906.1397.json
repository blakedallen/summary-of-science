These results are tight in two ways. First, the condition on p essentially cannot be\nrelaxed. Second, it is impossible to improve the constant 1/2 in the assumption for the minimum\ndegree. We also prove corresponding results for pseudo-random graphs.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA typical result in graph theory can be stated as \"Under certain conditions, a graph G possesses\na property P\". Once this type of a result is established, it is natural to ask \"How strongly does\nG possess P?\". In fact, several important results in extremal graph theory can be viewed as an\nanswer to this question for various graph properties (we will provide some concrete examples after\nintroducing necessary definitions). In this paper we will study this question in the context of random\nand pseudo-random graphs. The random graph model we consider is the binomial random graph\nG(n, p). The random graph G(n, p) denotes the probability space whose points are graphs with vertex\nset [n] = {1, . . . , n} where each pair of vertices forms an edge randomly and independently with\nprobability p. We say that G(n, p) possesses a graph property P asymptotically almost surely, or\na.a.s. for brevity, if the probability that G(n, p) possesses P tends to 1 as n goes to infinity. The\npseudo-random graphs we will study are (n, d, \u03bb)-graphs with \u03bb = o(d), where an (n, d, \u03bb)-graph is\na d-regular graph on n vertices whose second largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of the adjacency\nmatrix is bounded by \u03bb. The abundance of structure and results arising from this simple looking\ndefinition is quite surprising (see, e.g., [13] for more details). A graph property is called monotone\nincreasing (decreasing) if it is preserved under edge addition (deletion).\nThe main concept studied in this paper and briefly outlined above is that of resilience. Formally,\nfollowing [16], we define:\nDefinition 1. Let P be a monotone increasing (decreasing) graph property.\n\u2217\n\nSchool of Mathematical Sciences, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel\nAviv, 69978, Israel.

Another\nclassical theorem, that of Dirac (see, e.g., [7]) can be rephrased as \"Kn has local resilience \u230an/2\u230b with\nrespect to Hamiltonicity\". As these examples suggest, the notion of resilience lies in the center of\nextremal graph theory. In [16], Sudakov and Vu have initiated the systematic study of global and\nlocal resilience of random and pseudo-random graphs. They obtained resilience results with respect to\nvarious properties such as perfect matching, hamiltonicity, chromatic number and having a nontrivial\nautomorphism (this result appeared in their earlier paper with Kim [12]). For example, they showed\nthat if p > log4 n/n then a.a.s. any subgraph of G(n, p) with minimum degree (1/2 + o(1))np is\nhamiltonian. An interesting thing to notice is that this result can be viewed as a generalization of\nDirac's Theorem mentioned above as a complete graph is also a random graph G(n, p) with p = 1.\nAs we will see, this connection is very natural and most of the resilience results can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of classic graph theory results to random and pseudo-random graphs.\nThere are several other papers that obtained resilience type results. Krivelevich and Frieze [8]\ngave a lower bound (not tight) on resilience of G(n, p) with respect to being Hamiltonian in the\nrange of p not covered by the above mentioned result of Sudakov and Vu. Dellamonica, Kohayakawa,\nMarciniszyn and Steger [6] studied the global resilience of random graphs with respect to containing a\ncycle of length at least (1\u2212\u03b1)n for a fixed \u03b1 as a generalization of a theorem of Woodall [18]. Recently,\nBen-Shimon, Krivelevich and Sudakov [2] investigated the resilience of random regular graphs with\nrespect to being hamiltonian.\nA graph on n vertices is called pancyclic if it contains cycles of length t for all 3 \u2264 t \u2264 n. In this\npaper, we study the resilience of random and pseudo-random graphs with respect to this property.\nSimilarly to the above mentioned results, our result can also be viewed as a generalization of a classical\nresult in graph theory \u2013 that by Bondy [3]. It says that if G is a graph on n vertices with minimum\ndegree greater than n/2, then G is pancyclic. The corresponding theorems we prove are,\nTheorem 1.1. If p \u226b n\u22121/2 then G(n, p) asymptotically almost surely has local resilience (1/2 +\no(1))np with respect to being pancyclic.\nTheorem 1.2. Let G = (V, E) be a (n, d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying d2 /n \u226b \u03bb. Then G has local resilience\n(1/2 + o(1))d with respect to being pancyclic.\nOur results are asymptotically tight in two ways. First, one cannot improve the constant 1/2 since\nboth random and pseudo-random graphs can be made bipartite by randomly partitioning the graph\ninto two equal size parts. In this way we typically have a subgraph with minimum degree about one\nhalf of the original degree which does not contain any odd cycles. Second, the restrictions on the\nparameters are also essentially tight. To see this for random graphs, note that if p \u226a n\u22121/2 then\ntypically each vertex has degree (1 + o(1))np and the number of triangles containing each vertex is at\nmost O(n2 p3 ) \u226a np. Therefore deleting edges of all triangles leaves all degrees essentially unchanged.\n2\n\n\fFor pseudo-random graphs this can be derived from a variant of the construction of Alon [1] (see, e.g.,\n[13]) which gives a triangle-free (n, d, \u03bb)-graph with d3 /\u03bb2 = \u0398(n).\nWe can also prove more general results for sparser graphs. Let the girth of a graph be the length\nof its shortest cycle and the circumference be the length of its longest cycle. Brandt, Faudree and\nGoddard [5] called a graph weakly pancyclic if it contains cycles of length t where t ranges from its girth\nup to its circumference. The following theorems, generalizing Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, are motivated by\nthis concept of weak pancyclicity.\nTheorem 1.3. For any fixed integer l \u2265 3, if p \u226b n\u22121+1/(l\u22121) then G(n, p) asymptotically almost\nsurely has local resilience (1/2 + o(1))np with respect to containing cycles of length t for all l \u2264 t \u2264 n.\nTheorem 1.4. Let k be either 3 or an even integer satisfying k \u2265 4 and let G = (V, E) be a (n, d, \u03bb)graph satisfying dk\u22121 /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 . Then G has local resilience (1/2 + o(1))d with respect to containing\ncycles of length t for all k \u2264 t \u2264 n.\nThe above results are not exactly weak pancyclicity results since if we allow the adversary to\ndelete half of the edges at each vertex he might decide not to remove a 3-cycle and then remove every\nother cycle of length 4 up to l \u2212 1. But still it is best to view these results in the context of weak\npancyclicity. Similarly as before, the result for random graphs is asymptotically tight. Indeed, note\nthat if p \u226a n\u22121+1/(l\u22121) then typically each vertex of the random graph has degree (1 + o(1))np and the\nnumber of cycles of length l containing each vertex is at most O(nl\u22121 pl ) \u226a np. Therefore we can delete\nfew edges from each vertex to remove every l-cycle. We suspect that our result for pseudo-random\ngraphs is asymptotically tight as well. Note that the assumption dk\u22121 /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 in particular implies\n\u03bb = o(d) since dk\u22122 \u2265 dk\u22121 /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 , so even when we do not explicitly mention \u03bb = o(d), we are\nalways in this situation. Although odd integers k > 3 are omitted from the result of pseudo-random\ngraphs, nevertheless in this case dk\u22121 /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 implies dk /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22121 and so by using the result for\nk + 1 (which is now even) we can find cycles of length t for all k + 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n. We believe that the\nresult of Theorem 1.4 is valid also for odd k \u2265 5, but at present we do not have enough tools to verify\nit. We will address this point in more details in concluding remarks.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we collect some known results which\nwe need later to prove our main theorems. In Section 3 we establish properties of random graphs and\nuse them in Section 4 to prove Theorem 1.3. In Sections 5, 6 we follow the same pattern to prove the\npseudo-random graph analog, Theorem 1.4. The last section contains some concluding remarks and\nopen problems.\nNotation. G = (V, E) denotes a graph with vertex set V and edge set E. We use v \u223c w to\nindicate that v, w are adjacent. \u2206(G), \u03b4(G) denote the maximum degree and the minimum degree of\nG, respectively. For a set X \u2282 V , let N (X) be the collection of all vertices v which are adjacent to\nat least one vertex in X. If X = {u} is a singleton set we denote its neighborhood by N (u). Let\nN (0) (v) := {v} and N (k) (v) be the vertices at distance exactly k from v. This can also be recursively\ndefined as N (k) (v) = N (N (k\u22121) (v))\\(N (k\u22121) (v) \u222a N (k\u22122) (v)). Note that N (1) (v) = N (v). For a set X,\nwe denote by E(X) the set of edges in the induced subgraph G[X] and by e(X) = |E(X)| its size.\nSimilarly, for two sets X and Y , we denote by E(X, Y ) the set of ordered pairs (x, y) \u2208 E such that\nx \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y , also e(X, Y ) = |E(X, Y )|. Note that e(X, X) = 2e(X). If we have several graphs,\n(k)\nthen the graph we are currently working with will be stated as a subscript. For example NG (v) is\nthe k-th neighborhood of v in graph G. A cycle of length l is denoted by Cl .\n3\n\n\fWe also utilize the following standard asymptotic notation. For two functions f (n) and g(n),\nwrite f (n) = \u03a9(g(n)) if there exists a constant C such that lim inf n\u2192\u221e f (n)/g(n) \u2265 C. If there is a\nsubscript such as in \u03a9\u01eb this means that the constant C may depend on \u01eb. We write f (n) = o(g(n))\nor f (n) \u226a g(n) if lim supn\u2192\u221e f (n)/g(n) = 0. Also, f (n) = O(g(n)) if there exists a positive constant\nC > 0 such that lim supn\u2192\u221e f (n)/g(n) \u2264 C. Throughout the paper log denotes the natural logarithm.\nTo simplify the presentation, we often omit floor and ceiling signs whenever these are not crucial and\nmake no attempts to optimize absolute constants involved. We also assume that the order n of all\ngraphs tends to infinity and therefore is sufficiently large whenever necessary.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we collect various results to be used later in the proofs of the theorems.\n\n2.1\n\nResilience\n\nThe local resilience of random graphs with respect to being hamiltonian [16] and containing fixed\ncycles ([9], [10], [15]) have been studied before and our arguments for the proof of the main theorems\nwill use these results. The following results about the local resilience of random and pseudo-random\ngraphs with respect to hamiltonicity were proved in [16].\nTheorem 2.1. For every fixed \u01eb > 0, if p \u2265 log4 n/n then the random graph G(n, p) with probability\n1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ) has local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np with respect to being hamiltonian.\nRemark. The above formulation is stronger than the original statement since it explicitly states the\nsuccess probability to be 1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ). But this conclusion follows from the original argument if one\ncarefully performs the error probability calculations. We will need this stronger estimate on success\nprobability for our application.\nDuring the proof we will work with graphs that are similar to (n, d, \u03bb)-graphs but are not necessarily\nregular. The particular graphs we will encounter are graphs G = (V, E) on n vertices that have\nminimum degree at least (1 \u2212 \u01eb)d and satisfy the constraint\ne(X, Y ) \u2212\n\np\nd\n|X||Y | \u2264 \u03bb |X||Y | for all X, Y \u2282 V\nn\n\non the number of edges between sets. We will call such graphs (n, \u01eb, d, \u03bb)-graphs. Observe that\n(n, 0, d, \u03bb)-graphs are a more general/flexible concept than that of (n, d, \u03bb)-graphs, as it does not put\nspecific assumptions on graph eigenvalues.\nTheorem 2.2. Fix \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 such that 0 \u2264 5\u01eb\u2032 < \u01eb, k \u2265 3 and let G be an (n, \u01eb\u2032 , d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying\ndk\u22121 /n = \u03c9(n)\u03bbk\u22122 for an arbitrary function \u03c9(n) increasing to infinity. Then for large enough n, G\nhas local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d with respect to being hamiltonian.\nRemark. The theorem above does not appear in the original paper [16] and unfortunately we cannot\ndirectly apply the result from Sudakov and Vu. But in fact, they proved a general theorem which can\nbe modified to work under the assumption above. The necessarily modification will be given in the\nAppendix.\n4\n\n\fNext we state the results of Haxell, Kohayakawa and Luczak ([9], [10]) about the local resilience of\nrandom graphs with respect to containing a fixed cycle Cl , and of Sudakov, Szab\u00f2 and Vu [15] about\nthe local resilience of pseudo-random graphs with respect to containing a triangle.\nTheorem 2.3. For any fixed integer l \u2265 3 and \u01eb > 0, there exists a constant C = C(l, \u01eb) such that, if\np \u2265 Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) then G(n, p) a.a.s. has local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np with respect to containing\nCl .\nTheorem 2.4. Let G be a (n, d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying d2 /n \u2265 \u03c9(n)\u03bb for an arbitrary function \u03c9(n)\ntending to infinity. Then G has local resilience (1/2 + o(1))d with respect to containing a triangle.\nRemark. Both theorems are originally stated in a global resilience form but for convenience we stated\nit as above in a slightly weaker local resilience form. Also the conclusion of Theorem 2.3 (as stated)\nfor even cycles is weaker than in the original paper.\n\n2.2\n\nExtremal Graph Theory\n\nThe following simple but useful lemma allows one to find a large minimum degree subgraph in a graph\nwith large average degree. (See, e.g., [7], Proposition 1.2.2)\nLemma 2.5. Let G = (V, E) be a graph on n vertices with at least dn/2 edges. Then G contains a\nsubgraph G\u2032 \u2282 G with minimum degree at least d/2.\nNext theorem is a classical result by Bondy and Simonovits [4] about even cycles in graphs.\nTheorem 2.6. Let k be a positive integer and G = (V, E) be a graph on n vertices satisfying |E| >\n90kn1+1/k . Then G contains a cycle of length 2k.\nWe will also need the celebrated P\u00f2sa rotation-extension lemma (see [14], Ch. 10, Problem 20).\nThis lemma will help us in finding long paths in a graph with expansion properties.\nLemma 2.7. Let G = (V, E) be a graph such that |N (X) \\ X| \u2265 2|X| \u2212 1 for all X \u2282 V with |X| \u2264 t.\nThen for any vertex v \u2208 V there exists a path of length 3t \u2212 2 in G that has v as an end point.\n\n2.3\n\nConcentration\n\nThe following two well-known concentration results (see, for example [11], Theorems 2.3 and 2.10)\nwill be used several times during the proof. We denote by Bi(n, p) a binomial random variable with\nparameters n and p.\nTheorem 2.8. (Chernoff inequality) If X \u223c Bi(n, p) and \u01eb > 0, then\n\u0001\nP |X \u2212 E[X]| \u2265 \u01ebE[X] \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (E[X]) .\n\nLet m, n and N be positive integers with m, n < N , let X = [N ], X \u2032 = [n], and let A be a\nm-element subset of X chosen uniformly at random. Then the distribution of the random variable\n|A \u2229 X \u2032 | is called the hypergeometric distribution with parameters N, n and m.\nTheorem 2.9. Let X have the hypergeometric distribution with parameters N, n and m. Then,\n\u0001\nP |X \u2212 E[X]| \u2265 \u01ebE[X] \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (E[X]) .\n5\n\n\f3\n\nProperties of Random Graphs\n\nIn this section we establish properties of random graphs to be used later to prove Theorem 1.3.\nFirst we show formally a rather expected monotonicity property \u2013 (relative) local resilience with\nrespect to cycles can only grow with the edge probability p(n).\nProposition 3.1. Let l be fixed and let p\u2032 = p\u2032 (n) satisfy: 0 < p\u2032 \u2264 p \u2264 1 and np\u2032 \u226b log n. If G(n, p\u2032 )\na.a.s. has local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)np\u2032 with respect to containing cycles of length t for all\nl \u2264 t \u2264 n then G(n, p) a.a.s. has local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np with respect to the same property.\nProof. Let P be the property of having local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)np\u2032 with respect to\ncontaining every cycles of length t for all l \u2264 t \u2264 n. Define q = p\u2032 /p and consider the following\ntwo round process of exposing the edges of G(n, p\u2032 ). In the first round, every edge appears with\nprobability p (call this graph G1 ). Then at the second round, every edge that appeared in the first\nround will remain with probability q and will be deleted with probability 1 \u2212 q (call this graph G2 ).\nThen G1 has the same distribution as G(n, p) and G2 has the same distribution as G(n, p\u2032 ). By our\nassumption we know that G2 a.a.s. has property P. Now define X to be the event that G1 satisfies:\nP (G2 \u2208\n/ P|G1 ) \u2265 1/2. Then (1/2)P (X) \u2264 P (G2 \u2208\n/ P) = o(1) and therefore P (X) = o(1). Thus a.a.s.\nin G(n, p), P (G2 \u2208\n/ P|G1 ) < 1/2 or in other words P (G2 \u2208 P|G1 ) \u2265 1/2. Let A be the collection of\ngraphs G1 \u2208 G(n, p) having this property.\nNow given any subgraph H of G1 with maximum degree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np, select every edge\nwith probability q to get a graph H \u2032 . Then by Chernoff inequality, each vertex of H \u2032 has maximum\n\u2032\ndegree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)np\u2032 with probability at least 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (np ) = 1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ). Therefore H \u2032 has\nmaximum degree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)np\u2032 with probability at least 1 \u2212 o(1).\nFinally to put things together, condition on the event that G1 = G(n, p) \u2208 A. By the first part of\nthe proof a.a.s. G \u2208 A so if we can prove the claim under this assumption then we are done. Given a\nsubgraph H \u2282 G with maximum degree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np, sample every edge of G with probability\n\u2032\nq to obtain subgraphs H \u2032 \u2282 G\u2032 \u2282 G. Since G \u2208 A, we know that\n\u0001 P (G \u2208 P|G) \u2265 1/2 and by the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsecond part of the proof we know that P \u2206(H ) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)np \u2265 1 \u2212 o(1). Thus, these two events\nhave a non-empty intersection and therefore it is possible to find subgraphs H \u2032 \u2282 G\u2032 \u2282 G such that\nG\u2032 \u2208 P and \u2206(H \u2032 ) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)np\u2032 . Then G\u2032 \u2212 H \u2032 (and hence G \u2212 H) must contain cycles of length\nt for all l \u2264 t \u2264 n.\nRemark. Note that there is nothing special about the property of \"containing cycles\" and in fact if\nfor some log n/n \u226a p\u2032 \u2264 p and \u03b1 > 0, we have a monotone increasing graph property Q such that\nG(n, p\u2032 ) a.a.s. has local resilience at least (\u03b1 + o(1))np\u2032 with respect to having property Q then G(n, p)\na.a.s. has local resilience at least (\u03b1 + o(1))np with respect to having property Q.\n\nFrom now on we may assume that p = Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) instead of p \u2265 Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) since if we can\nprove the theorem under this condition then we can extend it to the whole range using the previous\nproposition. Moreover we will assume that the constant C is large enough without further mentioning.\nIn the next two lemmas we establish some expansion properties of random graphs.\nLemma 3.2. Fix a positive integer l and 0 < \u01eb < 1 and let G = (V, E) be a random graph G(n, p)\nwith p = Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) . Then a.a.s. every subset X \u2282 V of size |X| \u2264 (2C)l\u22121 n\u22121 p\u22122 satisfies\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)|X|np \u2264 |N (X)| \u2264 (1 + \u01eb)|X|np.\n6\n\n\fProof. Fix a set X \u2282 V of size |X| \u2264 (2C)l\u22121 n\u22121 p\u22122 . For each v \u2208 V let Yv be indicator random\nvariable of the event that v \u2208 N (X). Since |X|p = o(1), we have P (Yv = 1) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)|X| =\nP\n(1 + o(1))|X|p. Consider the random variable Y = v\u2208V \\X Yv = |N (X) \\ X| and note that\nE[Y ] =\n\nX\n\nv\u2208V \\X\n\nP (Yv = 1) = (n \u2212 |X|)(1 + o(1))|X|p = (1 + o(1))|X|np.\n\nMoreover if v \u2208 V \\X then Yv are mutually independent so we can apply the Chernoff inequality to\nget\n\u0001\nP |Y \u2212 E[Y ]| \u2265 (\u01eb/3)E[Y ] \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (E[Y ]) .\n\nCombine this with the estimate on E[Y ] and we have,\n\n\u0001\nP (1 \u2212 2\u01eb/3)|X|np \u2264 Y \u2264 (1 + 2\u01eb/3)|X|np \u2265 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (E[Y ]) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (|X|np)\n\nfor large enough n. Finally, note that |N (X) \u2212 Y | \u2264 |X| = o(|X|np) and thus for large enough n, we\nhave (1 \u2212 \u01eb)|X|np \u2264 |N (X)| \u2264 (1 + \u01eb)|X|np with probability at least 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (|X|np) .\nTaking the union bound over all choices of X, we get\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0011k\n\u0010 en\nX\nX\nX\nn \u2212\u03a9\u01eb (knp)\n\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (|X|np)\ne\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (np)\ne\n=\ne\n\u2264\nk\nk\n1\u2264|X|\u2264(2C)l\u22121 n\u22121 p\u22122\n1\u2264k\u2264(2C)l\u22121 n\u22121 p\u22122\n1\u2264k\u2264(2C)l\u22121 n\u22121 p\u22122\nX\n\u2264\nne\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (np) \u2264 n2 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (np) = o(1).\n1\u2264k\u2264(2C)l\u22121 n\u22121 p\u22122\n\nThis implies the assertion of the lemma.\nLemma 3.3. Fix a positive integer l and 0 < \u01eb < 1 and let G = G(n, p) be a random graph with\np = Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) . Then a.a.s. G has the following property . If H is a subgraph of G with maximum\ndegree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np and G\u2032 = G \u2212 H, then every set X with |X| \u2265 2\u2212l (np)l\u22122 satisfies\n|NG\u2032 (X)| \u2265 (1/2 + \u01eb/2)n.\nProof. It is enough to show that a.a.s. for any H as above the claim holds for every set X with\nsize exactly |X| = 2\u2212l (np)l\u22122 . Fix a set X of size 2\u2212l (np)l\u22122 and let Y \u2282 V be a set of size |Y | \u2265\n(1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)n disjoint from X. Then we have E[eG (X, Y )] = |X||Y |p > 2\u2212l\u22122 (np)l\u22121 = 2\u2212l\u22122 C l\u22121 n\nand by the Chernoff inequality,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212l\u22122 C l\u22121 n)\nP eG (X, Y ) \u2212 |X||Y |p \u2265 (\u01eb/4)|X||Y |p\n< e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (|X||Y |p) \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (2\n.\n(1)\nThus with probability at least the right hand side of (1) we have eG (X, Y ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb/4)|X||Y |p \u2265\n( 12 \u2212 3\u01eb/4)|X|np. Since there are at most 22n possible choices of the pairs X, Y and the right hand\nside of (1) is \u226a 2\u22122n for large enough C, we a.a.s. have eG (X, Y ) > ( 12 \u2212 \u01eb)|X|np for every pair X, Y\nas above.\nOn the other hand, we know that eH (X, Y ) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np|X|. Therefore a.a.s. eG\u2032 (X, Y ) \u2265\neG (X, Y ) \u2212 eH (X, Y ) > 0. This implies that NG\u2032 (X) \u2229 Y 6= \u2205 for all Y with |Y | \u2265 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)n. Thus\n|NG\u2032 (X)| \u2265 n \u2212 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)n = (1/2 + \u01eb/2)n.\nWe also need the following lemma that proves expansion property for subgraphs of G(n, p) with\nlarge minimum degree.\n7\n\n\fLemma 3.4. If p = Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) and \u01eb\u2032 > 0 then a.a.s. every subgraph G\u2032 \u2282 G(n, p) with minimum\n1 \u2032\n\u01eb n,\ndegree at least \u01eb\u2032 np satisfies the following expansion property.

Assume to the contrary that there exists a set X \u2282 V such that |X| \u2264 80\n1\n\u2032\n2|X|, and let Y = X \u222a NG\u2032 (X) so that |Y | \u2264 3|X| \u2264 20 \u01eb n.

Now we will estimate the probability that such event\n1 \u2032\n\u01eb n since G\u2032 has\ncan happen for a set Y with |Y | = a. We can restrict the range to \u01eb\u2032 np \u2264 a \u2264 20\n\u2032\nminimum degree at least \u01eb np.

First we need an additional lemma which gives us more properties\nof a random graph with deleted edges.\nLemma 4.1. For every integer l \u2265 3 and \u01eb > 0 there exists C = C(\u01eb) such that if p = Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121)\nthen G = G(n, p) a.a.s. has the following properties.

Let v be a vertex of G and for simplicity of notation let Yj = NG\u2032 (v) for j = 1, . . . , l \u2212 2.\n(a) By using induction we will show that 2\u2212i (np)i \u2264 |Yi | \u2264 (1 + \u01eb)i (np)i for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l \u2212 2.\n(1)\nFor the initial case i = 1 by Lemma 3.2 we have |Y1 | \u2264 |NG (v)| \u2264 (1 + \u01eb)np. By the same lemma\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nwe also know that |NG (v)| \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)np. Therefore |Y1 | \u2265 |NG (v)| \u2212 |NH (v)| \u2265 np/2. Now\nassume that we have established the claim up to some i \u2264 l \u2212 3 and let us look at the case i + 1.\nFirst notice (1 + \u01eb)l\u22123 (np)l\u22123 \u2264 (2C)l\u22121 n\u22121 p\u22122 so that we can apply Lemma 3.2.

To obtain the lower bound, we use that |NH (Yi )| \u2264 \u2206(H)|Yi | and that\n|NG (Yi )| \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb/2)np|Yi | by Lemma 3.2 (where we substitute \u01eb/2 instead of \u01eb).

Thus we can bound the probability that w has degree\n(l\u22122)\nat least log n in NG (v) as follows:\n\u0012\n\n\u0012 l\u22122\n\u0012 l\u22122 l\u22121 \u0013log n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n(l\u22122)\n(l\u22122)\ne|NG (v)|p log n\n|NG (v)| log n\ne2 (np)l\u22122 p log n\ne2 C\n<\n=\n.\np\n<\nlog n\nlog n\nlog n\nlog n\n\nSince the last estimate is o(n\u22122 ), a.a.s. every pair of vertices as above satisfies the claim.\nNow we are ready to prove Theorem 1.3. First we restate it in a more accurate and general form.\nTheorem 4.2. For every \u01eb > 0 there exists C such that if p \u2265 Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) then G(n, p) almost surely\nhas local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)np with respect to being pancyclic.\nProof. By Proposition 3.1 we may assume that p = Cn\u22121+1/(l\u22121) where C is taken to be the maximal\nof the corresponding constants in Theorem 2.3 and Lemma 4.1. Let G = G(n, p), H be a subgraph of\nmaximum degree \u2206(H) \u2264 ( 21 \u2212 \u01eb)np, and G\u2032 = G \u2212 H. The proof consists of three parts. In each part\nwe will show the existence of short, medium length, and long cycles, respectively, in G\u2032 .\nShort Cycles. The existence of cycles of length l to 2l \u2212 2 in G\u2032 is a direct corollary of Haxell,\nKohayakawa and Luczak's Theorem 2.3.\nMedium Length Cycles. Now we show the existence of cycles of length 2l \u2212 1 up to\n(l\u22121)\nNG\u2032 (v).\n\n1\n320 \u01ebn.\n\nFix\n\n( 12\n\na vertex v \u2208 V and let Y =\nThen by Lemma 4.1 part (b) a.a.s. |Y | \u2265\n+ \u01eb/3)n. By\napplying the Chernoff inequality and then\ntaking\nthe\nunion\nbound\nover\nsets\nY\nof\nappropriate\nsizes, we\n\u0001\n|Y |\n1\nknow that a.a.s. eG (Y ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb/6) 2 p \u2265 4 |Y |np. And by the restriction on the maximum degree\nof H we know that eH (Y ) \u2264 21 ( 12 \u2212 \u01eb)|Y |np. Therefore,\neG\u2032 (Y ) \u2265 eG (Y ) \u2212 eH (Y ) \u2265\n\n1\n1\n\u01eb|Y |np \u2265 \u01ebn2 p.\n2\n4\n\nThus by Lemma 2.5, we can find a subgraph G1 \u2282 G\u2032 [Y ] with minimum degree at least 41 \u01ebnp. Fix any\n(i)\n\nvertex vl\u22121 \u2208 V (G1 ) and let vi \u2208 NG\u2032 (v) for i = 1, . . . , l \u22122 be the vertices of a path vv1 v2 . . . vl\u22121 in G\u2032\n9\n\n\f(l\u22122)\n\n(l\u22121)\n\n(l\u22121)\n\nfrom v to vl\u22121 . Delete every vertex in NG\u2032 (v1 )\u2229NG\u2032 (v) \u2282 NG\u2032 (v) except vl\u22121 from G1 to obtain\nG2 . Then by Lemma 4.1 part (c), \u03b4(G2 ) \u2265 \u03b4(G1 ) \u2212 log n, and so for large enough n, G2 has minimum\n1\n\u01ebn\ndegree at least 18 \u01ebnp. Now by Lemma 3.4, G2 has the property that every subset X of size |X| \u2264 640\nsatisfies |NG2 (X)\\X| \u2265 2|X|. Therefore by P\u00f2sa's rotation-extension Lemma 2.7 we can find a path\n1\n\u01ebn starting at vl\u22121 inside G2 . Let this path be P = vl\u22121 w1 . . . w\u01eb\u2032 n where\nP of length at least 320\n1\n\u2032\n\u01eb \u2265 320 \u01eb. Finally observe that for any vertex wt (t > 0) there is a path vz1 z2 . . . zl\u22122 wt in G\u2032 such that\n(j)\n\nzj \u2208 NG\u2032 (v) for j = 1, . . . l \u22122. Moreover since we deleted vertices that can be reached from v1 , vj 6= zj\nfor all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l \u2212 2. Thus we have a cycle vv1 . . . vl\u22121 w1 . . . wt zl\u22122 . . . z1 v which has length t + 2l \u2212 2.\nSince t can be arbitrarily chosen in the range 1 \u2264 t \u2264 \u01eb\u2032 n, we are done with the second part of the proof.\n\n1\nLong Cycles. Let \u03b1 = 320\n\u01eb. In this part we will show how to find all cycles of length from \u03b1n to n\nin G\u2032 . For a fixed integer n\u2217 satisfying \u03b1n \u2264 n\u2217 \u2264 n choose uniformly at random n\u2217 vertices V \u2217 out\nof V and let G\u2217 = G[V \u2217 ], H \u2217 = H[V \u2217 ]. Let P be the graph property of a graph on n\u2217 vertices having\nlocal resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)n\u2217 p with respect to hamiltonicity. We claim that with probability\n1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ), P (G\u2217 \u2208 P|G) \u2265 1/2. First note that G\u2217 has distribution G(n\u2217 , p) and apply Sudakov\nand Vu's Theorem 2.1 to get P (G\u2217 \u2208\n/ P) = o(n\u22121 ). Let A be the event in the probability space\nG(n, p) such that P (G\u2217 \u2208\n/ P|G) \u2265 1/2. Then we have (1/2)P (A) \u2264 P (G\u2217 \u2208\n/ P) = o(n\u22121 ). Therefore\n\u22121\n\u2217\nP (A) = o(n ), or in other words P (G \u2208 P|G) \u2265 1/2 with probability at least 1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ). Let An\u2217\nbe the collection of graphs G having this property.\nOn the other hand, observe that the degree of a vertex in H \u2217 follows the hypergeometric distribution\nand thus we can apply Lemma 2.9. Hence for a vertex v \u2208 V \u2217 ,\n\u0001\n\u2217\nP | degH \u2217 (v) \u2212 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)n\u2217 p| \u2265 \u01ebn\u2217 p/2 \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (n p) \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (np) ,\n\nthus a.a.s. every vertex in V \u2217 has degree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)n\u2217 p in H \u2217 . We can conclude that if\nG \u2208 An\u2217 then there exists a set V \u2217 of size n\u2217 such that G\u2217 \u2208 P and \u2206(H \u2217 ) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)n\u2217 p. This\ngives a hamilton cycle inside G\u2217 \u2212 H \u2217 which is a cycle of length n\u2217 inside G\u2032 = G \u2212 H.\nFinally note that since G \u2208 An\u2217 with probability at least 1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ), cycles of length n\u2217 exist with\nprobability at least 1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ) for any fixed n\u2217 by the previous observation. Therefore by taking the\nunion bound we can see that a.a.s. G\u2032 simultaneously contains cycles of length n\u2217 for all \u03b1n \u2264 n\u2217 \u2264 n.\nThis concludes the proof.\n\n5\n\nProperties of pseudo-random graphs\n\nHere we collect properties of pseudo-random graphs which we will use later to prove Theorem 1.4.\nThe main fact that we use about (n, d, \u03bb)-graphs is the following formula established by N. Alon (see,\ne.g., [13]) which connects between eigenvalues and edge distribution.\nLemma 5.1. If G = (V, E) is an (n, d, \u03bb)-graph, then for any X, Y \u2282 V we have,\ne(X, Y ) \u2212\n\np\nd\n|X||Y | \u2264 \u03bb |X||Y |.\nn\n\nAs in Section 3 we will prove several lemmas that establish some expansion properties of pseudorandom graphs. These lemmas correspond to Lemma 3.2, Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.4 in the random\ngraph case.\n10\n\n\fLemma 5.2. Let \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 be such that 0 \u2264 5\u01eb\u2032 < \u01eb, k \u2265 3, and let G = (V, E) be an (n, \u01eb\u2032 , d, \u03bb)-graph with\ndk\u22121 /n = \u03c9(n)\u03bbk\u22122 where \u03c9(n) \u2192 \u221e. Then G has the following property. If H is a subgraph of G\nwith \u2206(H) \u2264 (1/2\n\u2212 \u01eb)d and G\u2032 = G \u2212 H, then every set X with |X| \u2264 \u01ebn/4 satisfies |NG\u2032 (X)| \u2265\n\u0001\n2\nd\nmin \u01ebn/2, 4\u03bb\n2 |X| .\n\nProof. Let Y = NG\u2032 (X) and assume that |Y | \u2264 \u01ebn/2 as otherwise we are done. Since G\u2032 has minimum\ndegree at least (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 )d \u2212 \u2206(H) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 )d \u2212 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d \u2265 (1/2 + 4\u01eb/5)d, we have\neG\u2032 (X, Y ) \u2265 (1/2 + 4\u01eb/5)d|X| \u2212 2eG (X) \u2265 (1/2 + 4\u01eb/5)d|X| \u2212 (d|X|2 /n + \u03bb|X|)\n\u2265 (1/2 + 4\u01eb/5)d|X| \u2212 (\u01ebd/4 + \u03bb)|X| \u2265 (1/2 + \u01eb/2)d|X|.\n\n(2)\n\nOn the other hand, since |Y | \u2264 \u01ebn/2, we have:\neG (X, Y ) \u2264\n\np\np\nd|X||Y |\n+ \u03bb |X||Y | \u2264 (\u01eb/2)d|X| + \u03bb |X||Y |.\nn\n\nTherefore by (2),(3) and eG\u2032 (X, Y ) \u2264 eG (X, Y ) we have, (1/2 + \u01eb/2)d|X| \u2264 (\u01eb/2)d|X| + \u03bb\nd2\nwhich implies |Y | \u2265 4\u03bb\n2 |X|.\n\n(3)\np\n\n|X||Y |\n\nLemma 5.3. Let k \u2265 3 and let G = (V, E) be an (n, \u01eb\u2032 , d, \u03bb)-graph with dk\u22121 /n = \u03c9(n)\u03bbk\u22122 where\n\u03c9(n) \u2192 \u221e. Then for any function \u03b4 = \u03b4(n) such that 1 \u226a \u03b4 \u226a d2 /\u03bb2 , G has the following property. If\nH is a subgraph of G with \u2206(H) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d and G\u2032 = G \u2212 H, then every set X with |X| \u2265 \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d2 )n\nsatisfies |NG\u2032 (X)| \u2265 (1/2 + \u01eb/2)n.\n\nProof. We only have to verify this for sets of size exactly \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d2 )n, so assume for the contrary\nthat there exists X \u2282 V of size |X| = \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d2 )n which has |NG\u2032 (X)| < (1/2 + \u01eb/2)n and define\nY = V \\(X \u222a NG\u2032 (X)). Since |X| = o(n), we have |Y | > (1/2 \u2212 2\u01eb/3)n. Therefore by Lemma 5.1,\neG (X, Y ) \u2265\n\np\nd|X||Y |\n\u2212 \u03bb |X||Y | \u2265 (1/2 \u2212 2\u01eb/3)\u03b4(\u03bb2 /d)n \u2212 \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d)n > (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b4(\u03bb2 /d)n.\nn\n\nOn the other hand by the maximum degree restriction, eH (X, Y ) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d|X| = (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b4(\u03bb2 /d)n.\nBut since there are no edges between X and Y we must have 0 = eG\u2032 (X, Y ) \u2265 eG (X, Y )\u2212eH (X, Y ) > 0\nwhich gives us a contradiction.\nThe next lemma proves expansion property for subgraphs of (n, d, \u03bb)-graphs with large minimum\ndegree.\nLemma 5.4. Let G = (V, E) be an (n, d, \u03bb)-graph with \u03bb = o(d), and let G\u2032 be a subgraph of G\nwith \u03b4(G\u2032 ) \u2265 \u01ebd for some fixed constant \u01eb > 0. Then every X \u2282 V (G\u2032 ) with |X| \u2264 \u01ebn/10 satisfies\n|N (X)\\X| \u2265 2|X|.\n\nProof. Assume to the contrary that there exists a set X \u2282 V (G\u2032 ) with |X| \u2264 \u01ebn/10 and |N (X)\\X| <\n2|X|. Let A = X \u222a N (X) and note that |A| < 3|X|.

As in the random graph case, we need an additional lemma\nwhich gives us more properties of a pseudo-random graph with deleted edges.\nLemma 6.1. Fix \u01eb > 0, k \u2265 3 and let G = (V, E) be a (n, d, \u03bb)-graph with dk\u22121 /n = \u03c9(n)\u03bbk\u22122 where\n\u03c9(n) \u2192 \u221e. Let H be a subgraph of G with \u2206(H) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d, G\u2032 = G \u2212 H and v \u2208 V . Then there\nexist l, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 \u230a(k \u2212 1)/2\u230b and sets Xi (v), Yi (v) for i = 0, 1, . . . , l such that,\n(a) X0 (v) = Y0 (v) = {v}, Xi (v) \u2229 Yi (v) = \u2205, |Xi (v)| = |Yi (v)| for all i 6= 0;\n2\n\nd\n(b) |Xi+1 (v)| \u2265 16\u03bb\n2 |Xi (v)|, |Yi+1 (v)| \u2265\n(\u01eb/(8k))n for all i = 0, 1 . . . , l;\n\nd2\n|Y (v)|\n16\u03bb2 i\n\nfor all i = 0, . . . l \u2212 2 and |Xi (v)| = |Yi (v)| \u2264\n\n(c) Let Zi (v) = \u222aij=0 (Xj (v)\u222aYj (v)).

Let \u03b4 = \u03b4(n) = min(d/\u03bb, (\u03c9(n))1/2 ) and note that indeed \u03b4 \u2192 \u221e. Given a vertex v \u2208 V , we\nwill inductively construct sets Xi = Xi (v), Yi = Yi (v) satisfying the condition above. Since G\u2032 has\nminimum degree at least (1/2+\u01eb)d, put d/4 vertices of NG\u2032 (v) into X1 and put another d/4 vertices into\nY1 . Suppose that for some i \u2264 \u230a(k \u2212 1)/2\u230b \u2212 1 we have already constructed X0 , Y0 , . . . , Xi , Yi satisfying\nconditions (a), (b), (c), (d). Next we show how to construct Xi+1 , Yi+1 . Let Zi = \u222aij=0 (Xj \u222a Yj )\nand note that Zi \u2264 2i|Xi | \u2264 k|Xi |. If |Xi | = |Yi | \u2265 \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d2 )n then define l = i and stop the\nprocess. Otherwise |Xi | = |Yi | < \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d2 )n \u2264 (\u03bb/d)n = o(n) and by Lemma 5.2 we have that\nd2\n|N (Xi )|, |N (Yi )| \u2265 min(\u01ebn/2, 4\u03bb\n2 |X|). Thus\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd2\nd2\nN (Xi )\\Zi \u2265 min \u01ebn/2 \u2212 k|Xi |, 2 |Xi | \u2212 k|Xi | \u2265 min \u01ebn/4, 2 |Xi |\n4\u03bb\n8\u03bb\nand a similar inequality also holds for N (Yi ). Therefore, by splitting the vertices of N (Xi ) \u2229 N (Yi )\nbetween Xi+1 and Yi+1 we can always choose Xi+1 \u2282 N (Xi )\\Zi and Yi+1 \u2282 N (Yi )\\Zi so that Xi+1 \u2229\nd2\nd2\nYi+1 = \u2205 and |Xi+1 | = |Yi+1 | \u2265 (1/2) min(\u01ebn/4, 8\u03bb\n2 |Xi |). If \u01ebn/4 \u2264 8\u03bb2 |Xi | then |Xi+1 |, |Yi+1 | \u2265 \u01ebn/8,\nd2\nso stop the process and define l = i + 1. Otherwise we can make |Xi+1 |, |Yi+1 | \u2265 16\u03bb\n2 |Xi | and continue.\nNote that (b) holds in this case. If the process does not terminate after constructing X1 , . . . , X\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b\n2\nd2 \u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b\u22121\n\u2264 X\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b < \u03b4 \u03bbd2 n. This\nand Y1 , . . . , Y\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b then by property (b) we get that d4 ( 16\u03bb\n2)\nimplies:\nd\n\u03bb2\n\u03b4 2n >\nd\n4\n\n\u0012\n\nd2\n16\u03bb2\n\n\u0013\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b\u22121\n\nd\n\u2265\n4\n\n\u0012\n\nd2\n16\u03bb2\n\n\u0013k/2\u22122\n\n=\n\ndk\u22123\n\u03c9(n) \u03bb2\n=\n* n\n4k\u22123 \u03bbk\u22124\n4k\u22125 d2\n\nwhich is a contradiction, since \u03b4 \u226a \u03c9(n). Finally note that we can always shrink final sets Xl , Yl so\nthat they become smaller than (\u01eb/(8k))n. Since |Xl\u22121 | = |Yl\u22121 | < \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d2 )n \u226a (\u01eb/(8k))n, (b) holds\nfor all i = 0, 1 . . . , l. Thus we can find sets as claimed.\nWe are ready to prove Theorem 1.4. First we restate it here with more quantifiers.\n\n12\n\n\fTheorem 6.2. Fix \u01eb > 0 and let k be either 3 or an even integer satisfying k \u2265 4, and let G = (V, E)\nbe a (n, d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying dk\u22121 /n = \u03c9(n)\u03bbk\u22122 where \u03c9(n) \u2192 \u221e. Then for large enough n, G has\nlocal resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d with respect to containing cycles of length t for k \u2264 t \u2264 n.\n\nProof. Let H be a subgraph of G with \u2206(H) \u2264 (1/2\u2212\u01eb)d and let G\u2032 = G\u2212H. If d > (1\u2212\u01eb)n, then G\u2032\nhas minimum degree larger than (1/2+ \u01eb)d > (1/2+ \u01eb)(1\u2212 \u01eb)n > n/2 for small enough \u01eb > 0. Hence by\n\u2032\nBondy's theorem, mentioned\n\u221a in the introduction, G is pancyclic. Assume therefore that d \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)n.\nThis implies that \u03bb = \u03a9( d). Indeed, let A be the adjacency matrix of G and d = \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn be its\neigenvalues. The trace of A2 is the number of ones in A, which implies that\n2|E(G)| = nd = T r(A2 ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bb2i \u2264 d2 + (n \u2212 1)\u03bb2 .\n\nSolving the above inequality for \u03bb establishes the claim.\nA proof of the theorem consists of three parts. In each part we will show the existence of short,\nmedium length and long cycles respectively.\nShort Cycles. For k = 3, the existence of 3-cycles is a direct corollary of Sudakov, Szab\u00f3 and Vu's\nTheorem 2.4. Also in this case we have that d3 /\u03bb2 \u2265 d2 /\u03bb \u226b n. Therefore for k = 3 the existence of\ncycles of length 4, . . . ,\u221an follows from the proof of case k = 4. So from now on we assume that k = 2k\u2032\nis even. Since \u03bb = \u03a9( d), we have dk\u22121 = \u03c9(n)\u03bbk\u22122 n = \u03c9(n)\u03a9(dk/2\u22121 )n. Therefore d \u226b n2/k and by\nBondy and Simonovits' Theorem 2.6 G\u2032 must have a k-cycle.\nMedium Length Cycles. The next step is to prove the existence of cycles of length from k + 1\nup to \u01ebn/20. Fix a vertex v and apply Lemma 6.1 to find sets X1 = X1 (v), . . . , Xl = Xl (v), Y1 =\nY1 (v), . . . , Yl = Yl (v) where l \u2264 k\u2032 \u2212 1 with |Xl | = |Yl | \u2265 \u03b4(\u03bb2 /d2 )n and |Xi | = |Yi | \u2264 (\u01eb/(8k))n for\nall i = 1, . . . , l. Then | \u222ali=0 Xi \u222a Yi | \u2264 \u01ebn/4.\u0001 By Lemma 5.3 we know that |NG\u2032 (Xl )| \u2265 (1/2 + \u01eb/2)n\nand so if we let Z = NG\u2032 (Xl )\\ \u222ali=0 Xi \u222a Yi then |Z| \u2265 (1/2 + \u01eb/4)n. Since \u03bb = o(d), by Lemma 5.1,\nwe have eG (Z) \u2265 d|Z|2 /(2n) \u2212 \u03bb|Z|/2 \u2265 d|Z|/4. On the other hand eH (Z) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d|Z|/2.\nHence eG\u2032 (Z) \u2265 eG (Z) \u2212 eH (Z) \u2265 \u01ebd|Z|/2. This implies by Lemma 2.5 that inside G\u2032 [Z] we\ncan find a subgraph G1 \u2282 G\u2032 which has minimum degree at least \u01ebd/2. Then using Lemma 5.1\nit is easy to check that |V (G1 )| \u2265 \u01ebn/3 and so we can choose a set W \u2282 V (G1 ) \u2282 Z of size\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u01ebn/8. Then by Lemma\n\u0001 5.3, we have \u0001that both |NG (W )|, |NG (Yl )| \u2265 (1/2 + \u01eb)n. Therefore the\n2\u01ebn\n\u2212\n\u01ebn/4 > 0. In particular, there must\nset NG\u2032 (W ) \u2229 NG\u2032 (Yl ) \\ \u222ali=0 Xi \u222a Y\u0001i has size at least\n\u0001\nl\nexist a vertex p \u2208 NG\u2032 (W ) \u2229 NG\u2032 (Yl ) \\ \u222ai=0 Xi \u222a Yi , and let yl \u2208 Yl , w \u2208 W be neighbors of p in\nG\u2032 . Since yl \u2208 Yl , by the definition of Yl , there exists a path vy1 y2 . . . yl in G\u2032 from v to yl such that\nyi \u2208 Yi for i = 1, . . . l. If p \u2208 V (G1 ) then let G2 = G1 \\{p} and note that G2 has minimum degree at\nleast \u01ebd/4. Now by Lemma 5.4 every set X \u2282 V (G2 ) of size |X| \u2264 \u01ebd/40 satisfies |NG2 (X)\\X| \u2265 2|X|.\nThen by P\u00f2sa's rotation-extension Lemma 2.7 we know that there exists a path P = v0 v1 . . . vt starting at v0 = w which has length at least t \u2265 \u01ebn/20 inside G2 . For an arbitrary vi \u2208 P, i \u2265 0 since\nvi \u2208 V (G2 ) \u2282 NG\u2032 (Xl ), there is a path vx1 . . . xl vi in G\u2032 such that xi \u2208 Xi for i = 1, . . . , l. Thus we\nhave a cycle vx1 x2 . . . xl vi vi\u22121 . . . v0 pyl yl\u22121 . . . y1 v which has length 2(l + 1) + i + 1 \u2264 k + i + 1. Since\ni can be arbitrarily chosen in the range 0 \u2264 i \u2264 \u01ebn/20, we are done with the second part of the proof.\nLong Cycles. The final step is to prove the existence of cycles of length \u01ebn/20 to n. Pick \u01eb/20 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1\nsuch that n\u2217 = \u03b1n is an integer. Let V \u2217 \u2282 V be a set of size n\u2217 chosen uniformly at random and\n13\n\n\fG\u2217 = G[V \u2217 ], H \u2217 = H[V \u2217 ] be the induced subgraph of G, H respectively. Since d \u226b n2/k , by the\nconcentration of the hypergeometric distribution (Lemma 2.9), for every vertex v \u2208 V \u2217 we have that\n\u0001\n2/k\nP degH \u2217 (v) \u2265 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)\u03b1d \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (\u03b1d) \u2264 e\u2212\u03a9\u01eb (n ) .\n\nSimilarly, with probability 1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ), the graph G\u2217 has minimum degree (1 \u2212 \u01eb/6)\u03b1d and therefore if\nn is large enough, for every \u01ebn/20 \u2264 n\u2217 \u2264 n there exists a choice of V \u2217 where \u2206(H \u2217 ) \u2264 (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)\u03b1d\nand \u03b4(G\u2217 ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb/6)\u03b1d. Moreover since G\u2217 is an induced subgraph of G, its edge distribution is\nstill governed by the estimate from Lemma 5.1. Therefore G\u2217 is an (\u03b1n, \u01eb/6, \u03b1d, \u03bb)-graph. Now by\nSudakov and Vu's Theorem 2.2, for large enough n, G\u2217 has local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)\u03b1d with\nrespect to being hamiltonian. Thus for the choice of V \u2217 as above, G\u2217 \u2212 H \u2217 must contain a hamilton\ncycle which is a cycle of length n\u2217 in G\u2032 . This concludes the proof.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nConcluding Remarks\nCycles through a given vertex\n\nIn this paper we found cycles inside a subgraph of random and pseudo-random graphs. We proved\nthat under certain conditions there exist cycles of various lengths somewhere in the subgraph. In fact,\nwe can find most of these cycles even if we fix a vertex v and insist that a cycle of desired length passes\nthrough this vertex.\nTheorem 1.3 says that for any fixed integer l \u2265 3, if p \u226b n\u22121+1/(l\u22121) then G(n, p) almost surely has\nlocal resilience (1/2 + o(1))np with respect to containing cycles of length t for l \u2264 t \u2264 n. By carefully\nexamining the proof, one can realize that when finding middle length and long cycles, we can insist\non the cycle to pass through a fixed vertex. Thus we have that for any fixed vertex v, there is a cycle\nof length t for 2l \u2212 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n which passes through v. Observe in addition that for every odd integer\nl \u2264 t < 2l \u2212 1, we cannot guarantee a cycle of length t through a fixed vertex v as can be seen using\n(i)\nLemma 3.2. Let G = G(n, p). This lemma implies that for any fixed vertex v, |NG (v)| = o(n) for all\n(i)\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 l \u2212 2. Therefore typically the degrees inside NG (v) are all o(np), and we can delete every\nedge inside these sets without violating the maximum degree condition on H to get a graph G \u2212 H\nwhich does not contain a cycle of length t through v.\nSimilarly, Theorem 1.4 says that if k is either 3 or an even integer satisfying k \u2265 4 and G = (V, E)\nis a (n, d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying dk\u22121 /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 , then G has local resilience (1/2 + o(1))d with respect to\ncontaining cycles of length t for k \u2264 t \u2264 n. Again even if we fix a vertex we can force all the middle\nlength and long cycles to contain it. Namely, for any fixed vertex v, there exists a cycle of length k + 1\nup to n passing through v.\n\n7.2\n\nPaths through a given pair of vertices\n\nAnother possible and rather straightforward extension of our results is to show that random and\npseudo-random graphs are locally resilient with respect to the following property: for every given\npair of vertices u, v and for every given length l \u2265 t (where t is a constant depending on our choice of\nparameters, quite similarly to the situation in Theorems 1.3 and 1.4) there is a path of length l between\nu and v. We do not provide much details here, but here is a very short sketch of the argument. For\nmedium length paths (between t and \u03b4n, for some constant \u03b4 > 0) the proof is obtained by a rather\n14\n\n\ftrivial modification of the corresponding proofs for medium length cycles in Theorems 1.3 and 1.4. For\nexample, in the pseudo-random case, instead of growing sets Xi (v), Yi (v) as in the proof of Theorem\n1.4, we grow disjoint sets Xi (u) and Xi (v) till they reach substantial size, and then find a subgraph\nG1 with large minimum degree on at least (1/2 + \u03b4)n vertices in the neighborhood of Xi (u). Since\n|V (G1 )| \u2265 (1/2 + \u03b4)n, the set Xi (v) has a neighbor w in G1 . Due to expansion properties of G1 , there\nis a path of linear length in it starting from w. This path can be used to find paths of medium length\nbetween u and v. For paths of linear length, the key is the ability to find a Hamilton path through\na given pair of vertices u, v in an edge deleted random or pseudo-random graph. Here we can argue\nas follows. First, if e = (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G) \\ E(H) (where G is the original (pseudo-)random graph, and\nH is the graph of deleted edges meeting the imposed condition on maximum degree), add e to the\ngraph; clearly nothing really changes in its edge distribution. Then, find a path P of linear length\nwith e in somewhere in the middle (i.e., some sizable distance from both ends), and then grow P and\nclose it to a Hamilton cycle through rotations and extensions as usually, each time forbidding to touch\nan interval of constant length surrounding P ; our expansion assumptions enable easily to meet this\nrestriction. The so obtained Hamilton cycle C is guaranteed to contain e. Finally, omit e from C,\nthus getting a Hamilton path between u and v.\n\n7.3\n\nOpen Problems\n\nWe believe that Theorem 2.4 can be extended (with appropriate adjustments) to cycles of an arbitrary\nbut fixed odd length. More specifically, it is plausible that for an odd k \u2265 5, if G is an (n, d, \u03bb)-graph\nand dk\u22121 n/ \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 , then the local resilience of G with respect to containing a cycle of length k is\n(1/2 \u2212 o(1))d. The validity of this conjecture would allow to extend the assertion of Theorem 1.4 to\nall k \u2265 3.\nA more natural generalization of Theorem 2.4 (actually, of its original global resilience form as in\n[15]) is the following conjecture.\nConjecture 7.1. Let k \u2265 5 be an odd integer and G be a (n, d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying dk\u22121 /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 .\nThen G has global resilience (1/4 + o(1))nd with respect to being Ck -free.\n\nA\n\nProof of Theorem 2.2\n\nIn this appendix, we illustrate how the proof Theorem 2.2 follows from the results of Sudakov and Vu\n[16]. First we repeat the statement of the theorem here.\nTheorem A.1. Fix \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 such that 0 \u2264 5\u01eb\u2032 < \u01eb, k \u2265 3 and let G be an (n, \u01eb\u2032 , d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying\ndk\u22121 /n \u226b \u03bbk\u22122 . Then for large enough n, G has local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d with respect to\nbeing hamiltonian.\nAs mentioned above, this theorem is not part of the original paper. In fact, they proved the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem A.2. Let \u01eb > 0 be fixed and G be a (n, d, \u01eb)-graph such that d/\u03bb > log2 n. Then for large\nenough n, G has local resilience at least (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d with respect to being hamiltonian.\n\n15\n\n\fUnfortunately we cannot directly apply this result as our graph is not regular and we don't have\na bound on d/\u03bb. But Sudakov and Vu proved this result as a corollary of the following two results\nwhich can be modified to work in our situation,\nTheorem A.3. For any fixed \u01eb > 0 and sufficiently large n, the following holds. Let G be a connected\n4\ngraph of order n such that every subset U of G of size at most n/ log4 n satisfies |NG (U )| \u2265 log15 n * |U |\nand every subset W of size at least n/ log3 n has |NG (W )| \u2265 1+\u01eb\n2 n. Then G contains a Hamilton cycle.\nLemma A.4. For any fixed \u01eb > 0 and sufficiently large n the following holds. Let G be a (n, d, \u03bb)graph with d/\u03bb > log2 n and let H be a subgraph of G with maximum degree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d. Then\nthe graph G\u2032 = G \u2212 H is\n\u2022 connected;\n\u2022 every subset U of G\u2032 of size at most n/ log4 n satisfies |NG\u2032 (U )| \u2265\n\u2022 every subset W of size at least n/ log3 n has |NG\u2032 (W )| \u2265\n\nlog4 n\n15\n\n* |U |.\n\n1+\u01eb\n2 n.\n\nBy applying Lemma 5.2 and Lemma 5.3 we have the following result similar to Lemma A.4.\nLemma A.5. Fix \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 such that 0 \u2264 5\u01eb\u2032 < \u01eb, k \u2265 3 and let G be an (n, \u01eb\u2032 , d, \u03bb)-graph satisfying\ndk\u22121 /\u03bbk\u22122 \u226b n and let H be a subgraph of G with maximum degree at most (1/2 \u2212 \u01eb)d. Then the\ngraph G\u2032 = G \u2212 H is\n\u2022 connected;\n\u2022 every subset U of G\u2032 of size at most (\u03bb2 /d2 )n satisfies |NG\u2032 (U )| \u2265\n\n\u01ebd2\n4\u03bb2\n\n* |U |.\n\n\u2022 for an arbitrary function \u03b4(n) growing to infinity, every subset W of size at least \u03b4(n)(\u03bb2 /d2 )n\nhas |NG\u2032 (W )| \u2265 1+\u01eb\n2 n.\nTherefore we only need to prove the following theorem which is a variant of Theorem A.3.\nTheorem A.6. Let \u01eb > 0, k \u2265 3 be fixed dk\u22121 /\u03bbk\u22122 \u226b n. Then for sufficiently large n the following\nholds. Let G be a connected graph of order n such that every subset U of G of size at most (\u03bb2 /d2 )n\n\u01ebd2\n1+\u01eb\n2 2\nsatisfies |NG (U )| \u2265 4\u03bb\n2 * |U | and every subset W of size at least \u03b4(n)(\u03bb /d )n has |NG (W )| \u2265\n2 n.\nThen G contains a Hamilton cycle.\nWe omit the proof which is a word by word translation of the proof of Theorem A.3. (Actually we\nare in a more simple situation since we only need k/2 rotations compared to log n/ log log n as in the\noriginal proof.)\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
