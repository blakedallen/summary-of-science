They have the highest typical\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and will be observable out\nto redshifts of z \u223c 10 or greater [1\u20133], making MBHBs\nthe most distant sources that LISA will observe. Observations of MBHBs figure prominently in LISA's science\ngoals [4] and may provide particularly rich opportunities\nfor multi-messenger observation in conjunction with electromagnetic instruments. The potential for such observations depends particularly on LISA's ability to localize\nthe gravitational-wave sources on the sky and thereby\nfacilitate simultaneous or follow-up electromagnetic observation [5].\nLISA is an all-sky instrument in the sense that, at any\none instant, it is sensitive to sources at most points on\nthe sky. While this is advantageous from the perspective of detection of unknown sources, it is not helpful\nfor locating these sources on the sky. To build localization information, LISA takes advantage of the fact that\nMBHBs are observable for months or even years prior to\nmerger. During this time, LISA's orbit around the Sun\nintroduces both frequency and amplitude modulations to\nthe signal that can be used to determine source location\n[6]. The majority of studies of LISA's source location\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: sean@astro.columbia.edu\n\nabilities [6\u201315] focus on this mechanism and neglect the\nfinal merger-ringdown portion of the MBHB waveform,\nwhich is difficult to model and too brief to experience any\nmodulation from LISA's orbit.\nRecent work [16, 17] has shown that the mergerringdown portion of the MBHB signal, which is shortlived but has more power and occurs at higherfrequencies, can achieve sky localization comparable to\nthe long inspiral portion without any additional information from LISA's orbital modulation. The mechanism\nfor extracting this information is believed to be related\nto the complex response of LISA to gravitational waves\nat the upper end of the measurement band (above \u223c 3\nmHz, where finite arm length effects begin to become important [18]). In this paper, we investigate the combined\neffect of both localization mechanisms. Specifically, we\nexpand our previous analysis to include the full inspiral\nsignal, including orbital effects. We also include a third\nsignal channel, T\u0304 , relevant only at higher frequencies,\nwhich was excluded from the earlier analysis for technical reasons.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: In Section II,\nwe review our methodology, which closely follows [17].\nSection II A describes the construction of the inspiralmerger-ringdown (IMR) waveform using the \"IRS-EOB\"\nmodel [19]. Section II B describes our model for the LISA\ninstrument, including the response function and noise.\nFinally, Section II C explains how we calculate parameter\nerrors using the standard Fisher matrix formalism.\nIn Section III, we examine LISA's ability to localize\nsources, including the improvements that are gained as\ndifferent levels of realism are added. We find that for an\n\n\f2\nensemble of systems with total rest mass of 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299\nat a redshift of z = 1, observing the IMR signal with\na stationary detector (and therefore without the benefit\nof orbital modulation) provides better sky localization\nthan observing the inspiral signal with an orbiting detector. We then consider the observation of a complete IMR\nsignal with an orbiting detector and find the final error\nto be only a modest improvement over the IMR signalstationary detector result. Measuring the long-duration\ninspiral is essentially irrelevant to achieving LISA's localization potential. Nevertheless, the orbital information contained in the inspiral is still important for localizing signals in advance of merger, which may be critical for conducting counterpart searches. We find, in\nagreement with previous results, that LISA can localize most MBHBs to within the Large Synoptic Survey\nTelescope (LSST) field of view (FOV) several months\nbefore merger. With the complete IMR signal, \u223c 50%\nof MBHBs in our ensemble can be localized into the\nmuch smaller FOV of the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). This is possible mainly because of the extra\ninformation provided by the T\u0304 channel.\nIn Section IV, we demonstrate that the mergerringdown (MR) portion of the waveform provides additional information beyond the inspiral for all parameters.\nWe summarize and conclude in Section V, focusing on\nhow our results may impact alternative designs for LISA.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe procedure used to estimate the errors with which\nLISA will measure astrophysical source parameters of\nMBHBs closely follows that of our previous studies\n[16, 17]. We will provide a brief overview; those interested in more detail should consult [17]. To assess parameter accuracy, we require a model for the emitted\nwaveform, a model for the detector response and noise,\nand a method for converting these pieces of information\ninto a theoretical limit on the achievable accuracy in measuring parameters with LISA.\n\nA.\n\nWaveform Model\n\nWe use a complete IMR waveform model [19] tuned to\nmatch the available numerical simulations for nonspinning black hole binaries. This model, referred to as the\nIRS-EOB model, uses a conventional effective-one-body\n(EOB) Hamiltonian formalism to model the adiabatic inspiral [20]. The merger-ringdown is modeled using the\n\"implicit rotating source\" (IRS) formalism, which treats\nthe radiation source as a shrinking rigid rotator [19].\nThe waveform amplitude is calculated using a flux\nmodel that is constrained both to be consistent with the\ninspiral flux through 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order and\nalso to vanish as it approaches the ringdown frequency\n(referred to as \"Model 2\" and given by Eq. 19 in [19]).\n\nThe waveform phase is fit to a physically motivated functional form (see Eq. 9 in [19]).\nWorking in geometrized units where G = c = M =\nm1 + m2 = 1, the source model depends only on the\nmass ratio q \u2261 m1 /m2 (where m1 < m2 ) and the spins.\nWe generate a waveform time series using the IRS-EOB\nmodel with a signal cadence corresponding to a quarter\nwavelength at the highest frequency reached by the l = 4,\n+ 4 harmonics1 . After the source calculation, we\nm = \u2212\ntransform the waveform from the source coordinates to\nthe solar system barycenter (SSB). The SSB waveform\nhB is given by:\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013#\nX\nGM\ntc \u2212 t\n2i\u03c8\n\u22122\nhB = 2\n, (1)\ne\nYlm (\u03b9, \u03c6o ) hlm\nc DL\nM\nlm\n\nwhere \u22122 Ylm are the spherical harmonics of spin-weight\n\u22122 [21] and hlm is the dimensionless strain decomposed\nin that basis in the source frame. This transformation\ndepends on six parameters: the redshifted total system\nmass M = Mo (1 + z), the luminosity distance DL , the\ncoalescence time tc , and three angles describing the orientation of the binary. The coalescence time, tc , is defined\nas the time at which the peak of the waveform reaches\nthe solar system barycenter. For the angles, we use the\ninclination \u03b9 (with the convention that \u03b9 = 0 corresponds\nto the line of sight being coincident with the orbital axis\nof the binary), initial orbital phase \u03c6o , and polarization\nphase \u03c8.\nWe focus on a specific case that has appeared elsewhere\nin the literature (e. g. [7, 8]): an equal-mass, nonspinning\nMBHB with rest mass Mo = 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 at z = 1,\nobserved for the final year prior to merger. This mass is\ninteresting because it lies near the most sensitive range\nof the LISA instrument [3], merger-tree models predict\nLISA will observe a significant number of events in this\nrange [22], and excellent observational evidence exists for\nblack holes of this size [23\u201325].\nThe sky location of the binary, described by the ecliptic\nlatitude \u03b2 and longitude \u03bb, is applied by the instrument\nresponse, which we discuss below. We use the vector\n\u039ba \u2261 (ln M, ln DL , \u03b2, \u03bb, \u03b9, \u03c6o , \u03c8, tc ) to denote the complete set of variable parameters. We exclude the mass\nratio q from \u039ba , as it is not varied when computing parameter uncertainties, a procedure consistent with that\nused in [16, 17, 26].\n\nB.\n\nInstrument Model\n\nThe instrument model includes the transformation of\nthe SSB waveform hB to the LISA instrument outputs as\nwell as a model of the instrument noise. The instrument\n\n1\n\nWe oversample to accommodate interpolation when applying the\nresponse.\n\n\f3\noutputs are the {\u0100, \u0112, T\u0304 } TDI combinations described in\n[17] and based on the orthogonal {A, E, T } combination\n[27]. The response is computed by employing Synthetic\nLISA [28] to generate the {X, Y , Z} TDI combinations\n[29] and then converting to {\u0100, \u0112, T\u0304 } using\nZ \u2212X\n\u221a ,\n2 2\nX +Z \u22122Y\n\u221a\n,\n\u0112 =\n2 6\nX +Y +Z\n\u221a\n.\nT\u0304 =\n2 3\n\nWe use an analytic model of the noise in the {\u0100, \u0112, T\u0304 }\nTDI channels, obtained following the procedure in [30].\nThe expressions for the one-sided spectral densities are\n\n\u0100 =\n\n(2)\n\nS\u0100,\u0112 = 2 sin2 (\u03a6) [2 (3 + 2 cos(\u03a6) + cos(2 \u03a6)) Spm + (2 + cos(\u03a6)) Sop ] ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nST\u0304 = 8 sin2 (\u03a6) sin2 (\u03a6/2) 4 sin2 (\u03a6/2)Spm + Sop ,\nwhere \u03a6 \u2261 2\u03c0f L/c, f is the frequency, L is the arm\nlength, and Spm and Sop are the one-sided spectral densities of the proof-mass acceleration and optical pathlength noises,\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22122 s\n\u0013\u22122\nf\nf\n\u221248\n1+\nSpm = 2.5 \u00d7 10\n,\n1 Hz\n0.1 mHz\n\u00132\n\u0012\nf\n.\n(4)\nSop = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221237\n1 Hz\nIn our prior studies [16, 17], we neglected the T\u0304 channel due to inconsistencies that were observed between the\nanalytic noise model for ST\u0304 in (3) and the noise spectrum\nobtained from a time-domain simulation of ST\u0304 performed\nwith Synthetic LISA. We have now verified that the\ntwo models are consistent for f \u2265 0.5 mHz. Where noted,\nwe include contributions from the T\u0304 channel at these frequencies. We expect this to be a reasonably accurate approach since the response of the T\u0304 channel should vanish\nat low frequencies.\nFor the foreground of gravitational waves from unresolved compact binaries, we use the model developed in\n[31], by adding\nSgal = [4\u03a6 sin(\u03a6)]2 Sconf\n\n(5)\n\nto the expressions for S\u0100,\u0112 . Sconf is a signal confusion\nnoise estimate for a related measurement variable, taken\nfrom Eq. 14 of [31]. No gravitational-wave foreground is\nadded to the T\u0304 channel since Sconf \u226a ST\u0304 at the frequencies where T\u0304 is included.\nC.\n\nError estimation\n\nTo approximate the achievable measurement accuracy\nfor LISA, we apply the Fisher matrix formalism. While\n\n(3)\n\nnot as robust or informative as more sophisticated methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo [32], the computational efficiency of the Fisher matrix approach is well\nsuited for this type of performance estimation work.

The\nindividual Fisher matrices for each TDI channel to be\nincluded in the analysis are summed to form the total\nFisher matrix. Throughout this work, we calculate the\nparameter derivatives in (6) using second-order centered\ndifferencing (rather than one-sided as in [17]), with a fractional step size \u03b5a = \u2206\u039ba . We set \u2206 = 10\u22124 for the\ncoalescence time and \u2206 = 10\u22126 for all other parameters.\nThe covariance matrix, \u03a3ab , is well approximated by\nthe inverse of the Fisher matrix for signals with large\nSNR:\n\u0001\u22121 \u0002\n\u0003\n1 + O(SNR\u22121 ) ,\n(8)\n\u03a3ab = \u0393ab\n\u221a\nso that \u03c3 a \u2261 \u03a3aa is the standard deviation of parameter\n\u039ba . Because we use ln M and ln DL as parameters, the\nresulting uncertainties are fractional:\n\u03c3 ln M = \u03c3 M /M ,\n\u03c3 ln DL = \u03c3 DL /DL .\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\nThe uncertainty of the other dimensionful parameter, tc ,\nis not expressed fractionally, as one is generally interested\nin the absolute timing error, but we emphasize that one is\nfree to make either choice. We note that a poor choice of\nunits for tc could cause the Fisher matrix to have a large\ndynamic range and be ill conditioned for inversion. We\nfind that expressing tc in seconds yields computationally\ninvertible Fisher matrices for the cases we consider.\n\nIII.\n\nSKY LOCALIZATION\n\nAs mentioned in Section I, the localization of a particular MBHB source on the sky is critical for enabling\ncoordinated observations with electromagnetic observatories. One goal might be to locate the host galaxy in\nwhich the MBHB merger occurred. If the galaxy can\nbe identified and the redshift obtained, it can be combined with the luminosity distance determined from the\ngravitational waveform for use as a cosmological probe\n[5, 34]. The simplest way to identify a host galaxy would\nbe for LISA to generate an error volume that only contained a single galaxy. Unfortunately, even the most optimistic estimates of LISA's localization ability suggest\nthat this will not generally be possible [5]. Identifying\nthe host galaxy within LISA's error volume will then require other information, perhaps the detection of a transient electromagnetic signal associated with the merger\nitself. The nature of this possible signal is a subject of active research [35, 36], and it is unclear if it exists, when\nit might peak relative to the GW signal, and what its\nspectral content will be.\nThe observational effort needed to search for an EM\ncounterpart to an MBHB merger will depend on the ratio between LISA's sky localization error box and the\nfield of view (FOV) of the EM asset used to perform the\nsearch. Roughly speaking, this ratio will determine the\nnumber of telescope pointings that are needed to cover\nthe LISA error box. While some counterpart scenarios\ninvolve afterglows that persist long after coalescence, others involve signals that peak at or before coalescence and\nmay fade quickly. For these signals, it is important to\nhave some advance warning as to where on the sky (and\nwhen) the merger will occur, allowing for appropriate\nEM resources to be scheduled and pointed in advance.\nThe sky localization information produced by LISA's orbit accumulates with time over the months or years that\nthe MBHB is observed, allowing for such advance notices\nto be issued.\nFigure 1 summarizes various estimates for the development of precision in ecliptic latitude over time for a\nLISA observation of two equal-mass, nonspinning black\nholes with a combined rest mass Mo = 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 at\nz = 1. All of the curves show the median results from\nan ensemble of 100 systems with random sky locations\nand orientations. Except where noted, the low-frequency\nlimit of the inner product (7), flow , was set to 0.03 mHz.\nThe precise placement of this cutoff and the model of the\n\ninstrument noise between the cutoff and the lower limit\nof the \"official\" LISA measurement band at 0.1 mHz can\nhave a significant effect on the results [5, 8]. The curves\nare all shown as functions of time before tc , defined as\nthe peak of the waveform. In addition, we also show to\nthe right the final error achieved with the complete MR\nsignal.\nThe purple dot-dashed curve with square markers utilizes PN waveforms and a simplified model of the LISA\ninstrument response known as the low-frequency approximation (LFA). This approximation produces two channels of information which can be compared to the \u0100 and\n\u0112 TDI channels discussed in Section II B. The estimate\nis generated by the same code used in [11, 13], with the\nexception that here we ignore the effects of spin precession. We include it primarily for comparison with our\nown method described in Section II. Due to the breakdown of the post-Newtonian approximation, this curve is\ntruncated at the time corresponding to the Schwarzschild\ninnermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Therefore, this\nestimate is sensitive to sky localization information encoded in the waveform by LISA's orbital motion but is\nnot sensitive to localization information resulting from\ninclusion of the MR waveform or from the high-frequency\nresponse of the instrument.\nThe red dotted curve with diamond markers, based\non our previous work [17], uses the IRS-EOB waveform\nmodel, as described in Section II A, and the Synthetic\nLISA instrument response described in Section II B. Due\nto the aforementioned problem (now solved) of spurious\ninformation in the T\u0304 channel, only the \u0100 and \u0112 TDI\nchannels are included. In addition, the instrument response uses a stationary, non-orbiting constellation lying\nin the ecliptic plane instead of the usual LISA orbits.\nThis estimate is therefore only sensitive to the sky localization information provided by the interaction of the\nMR signal with the high-frequency response of the detector. Lacking the orbital contribution, we can safely\nremove a large portion of the inspiral by setting the lowfrequency limit to flow = 0.1 mHz for this single estimate\nonly. This helps reduce computation time.\nFor times before the ISCO, the errors in the orbits-only\nestimate (purple, dot-dashed, squares) are far less than\nthose in the stationary-LISA estimate (red, dotted, diamonds), suggesting that the orbital mechanism for sky localization dominates over these time periods. The dotted\ncurve only \"catches up\" to the dot-dashed curve \u223c 100\nseconds before the merger. However, by the time the\nfull signal is considered, the stationary-LISA errors have\nbecome \u223c 4 times smaller than the orbits-only errors at\nISCO. In other words, for nonspinning, equal-mass binaries in this mass range, observing the MR signal alone\ngives better localization information than observing the\nentire inspiral.\nThe remaining curves are new results, estimates which\ninclude both the complete IMR (IRS-EOB) waveform\nand a realistic, orbiting (Synthetic LISA) model of\nthe instrument.

The purple dot-dashed curve with square markers (based on [11, 13]) uses a post-Newtonian inspiral (I)\nwaveform and a low-frequency approximation (LFA) to the detector response that includes LISA's orbit. The red dotted curve\nwith diamond markers (based on [17]) uses the complete inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveform and Synthetic LISA (SL)\nfor the response function but neglects LISA's orbit, all frequencies below 0.1 mHz, and the T\u0304 channel. The green dashed curve\nwith triangle markers uses the IMR waveform, the SL response, and orbital effects, but neglects the T\u0304 channel. The blue solid\ncurve with circle markers includes all effects: the IMR waveform, the SL response with orbits, and all three TDI channels. The\nFOVs of LSST and JWST, as well as the location of the Schwarzschild ISCO, are shown for reference.\n\nbeen restored to 0.03 mHz in order to take advantage of\nthe orbital modulation. The green dashed curve with triangle markers includes only the \u0100 and \u0112 TDI channels,\nwhile the blue solid curve with circle markers includes\nthe T\u0304 channel as well.\nThe \u0100 , \u0112 estimate (green, dashed, triangles) tracks\nthe orbits-only estimate (purple, dot-dashed, squares) at\ntimes well before merger, thus confirming that our calculation is consistent with that of Lang and Hughes [11, 13]\nin the inspiral regime. It also tracks the stationaryLISA estimate (red, dotted, diamonds) as the MBHB\napproaches merger. When the entire IMR waveform is\nincluded, the orbiting and non-orbiting \u0100 , \u0112 estimates\ndiffer by only \u223c 10%. The dashed curve contains both\nmechanisms for localizing a source (orbits and highfrequency detector response to merger-ringdown), but\nit ultimately does not do significantly better than the\nstationary-LISA response alone. Our ability to localize\nsources well in advance of merger depends critically on\nthe orbital information. However, for the final achievable sky location accuracy in these systems, the inspiral\nis essentially irrelevant and only the MR signal need be\ntaken into account.\nThe estimate with all three TDI channels (blue, solid,\ncircles) begins to diverge from the orbits-only estimate\n(purple, dot-dashed, squares) at earlier times than the\n\u0100 , \u0112 estimate and reaches a value at coalescence that is\nabout half that of the \u0100 , \u0112 estimate. This represents the\nadditional contribution of the T\u0304 channel, which is concentrated at high frequencies. It is neglected implicitly in\nthe orbits-only estimate through the use of the LFA and\n\nexplicitly in the other two estimates. While all three TDI\nchannels are available in a fully operational, 6-link LISA,\nonly two channels are available if one link is down [38].\nUsing the green dashed line as a proxy for a 5-link LISA\nand comparing to the blue solid line, we can see roughly\nhow much the sky position determination is affected by\na non-optimal detector.\nFigure 1 also includes the FOV of two representative\nEM instruments that could be used for locating counterparts. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)\n[39] has a FOV of 9.6 deg2 , which we have modeled as a\nsquare aperture \u223c 186 arcmin on a side, and is designed\nto rapidly and repeatedly scan large areas of the sky.\nThe figure demonstrates that LISA will localize a typical equal-mass, nonspinning MBHB source of this mass\nand redshift within a single LSST field several months in\nadvance of merger. This will allow multiple exposures of\nthe target area to be made throughout the event in an\neffort to detect an optical transient.\nIf a transient signal is not bright enough to be visible\nwith a survey telescope such as LSST, then a more sensitive instrument with a narrower field of view may be required. In Fig. 1 we plot the 2.2 arcmin\u00d74.4 arcmin FOV\nof the NIRCam instrument on the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) [40] as an example of such an instrument. Our most complete estimate of LISA's localization\ncapabilities (IMR waveform, orbiting detector with Synthetic LISA response, all TDI channels) has a median\nlatitude error of 2.6 arcmin. This suggests that a single\nJWST exposure might be sufficient to cover the LISA\nerror box for this system.

The results in\nFig. 1 suggest that unlike the situation with LSST, in\nwhich a number of pre-merger images could be obtained,\na coordinated observation with JWST (or any other instrument with a similar FOV) will have to be a follow-up,\nas LISA requires the complete IMR waveform to provide\nprecise localization information. For example, at ISCO,\nthe best estimate for median latitude error exceeds the\nJWST FOV by roughly half an order of magnitude.\nAll of the curves in Fig. 1 represent the median LISA\nlatitude error for an ensemble of MBHB mergers. Figures 2 and 3 also show the distribution of both latitude and longitude errors, based on estimates with the\ncomplete IMR waveform and LISA's orbital modulation.\nSeparate panels show results including just \u0100 and \u0112 and\nresults including all three TDI channels. In each panel,\nthe solid line represents the median values (equivalent to\nwhat is plotted in Fig. 1), while the shaded area shows\nthe region spanned by the middle three quintiles of the\ndistribution. The left panels (\u0100, \u0112 only) show that the\nfinal LISA error box will lie within the FOV of JWST for\nsystems in the 80th percentile of sky localization precision. That is, both latitude and longitude are measured\nto within \u223c 4.4 arcmin or better for the top 20% of systems. When T\u0304 is included, the situation is better still,\nwith a full 50% of binaries in our ensemble fitting within\n\nthe JWST FOV2 . These figures show just how important\nT\u0304 is for computing final localization errors. Not only do\nthe medians drop for both parameters, but the width of\nthe distribution decreases as well. Although a 5-link and\n6-link LISA are indistinguishable at early times, complete functionality can have important effects for the full\nsignal.\nFor completeness, in Fig. 4 we show errors in luminosity distance, \u03c3 DL /DL , for IMR signals with orbital\nmodulation. Distance is the third axis of the 3D localization \"voxel.\" Given an assumed cosmological model, a\nmeasurement of distance is equivalent to a measurement\nof redshift. This approximate redshift can help decide between potential host galaxies located within the 2D error\nbox. We see that the median distance error drops below\na percent within the last day, reaching a minimum of less\nthan 0.1%. Unfortunately, this \"intrinsic LISA error\"\nis not the limiting uncertainty for measuring luminosity\ndistance. Weak lensing from matter between the source\nand the detector will slightly magnify or demagnify the\nGW signal in an unknown way, adding significant error\n\n2\n\nThese assertions are somewhat crude: The plot does not actually\nshow whether individual binaries meet the criterion. It is possible that some systems are well localized in latitude but poorly\nlocalized in longitude, and vice-versa.

In this section,\nwe explore the nature of this information. Throughout\nthis section, we always use the complete IMR waveform\nwith orbital modulation and all three TDI channels.\nOne question of interest is whether the information\nprovided by the MR signal is tightly coupled to just one\nor two of the elements in \u039ba or if it generally improves\nthe knowledge of all parameters. Figure 5 shows the time\nevolution of the median eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix\nfor the ensemble of systems studied in Section III. At\neach time step, \u0393ab was calculated using the \u0100, \u0112, and\nT\u0304 observables for every case in the ensemble using the\nprocedure described in Section II. These matrices were\nused to compute the eigenvalues for every case in the\nensemble, and the median values are plotted. A similar\nprocedure was used to compute the median eigenvectors\ncorresponding to these eigenvalues.\nAs (8) indicates, the Fisher matrix is a measure of\ninverse error or \"information.\" The increasing trends in\nthe curves in Fig. 5 represent information accumulating\nin the LISA observables as the signal evolves, just as\nthe decreasing trends in Figs. 1-4 represent a decrease\nin measurement error. The largest eigenvalue in Fig. 5\n(solid curve) corresponds to an eigenvector that mostly\nconsists of one parameter, ln M . The majority of the\ninformation in this eigenvalue accumulates early in the\ninspiral phase of the signal.

By comparison, the increase in SNR2 ,\nwhich one might naively expect to be proportional to\nFisher matrix eigenvalues, is \u223c 100 over this period.\nThe band of eigenvalues in the middle of Fig. 5 (dashed\ncurves) represent a mix of the five angular parameters in\n\u039ba and ln DL . The increase in these eigenvalues from\nISCO through ringdown is much more significant than\nthat for ln M , ranging from two to three orders of magnitude.\nThe smallest eigenvalue (dotted curve) corresponds to\nan eigenvector that mostly consists of tc . The small size\nof this eigenvalue is partly due to the intrinsic scale of the\nparameter, which was the only one in \u039ba to be expressed\nin physical units (seconds). It increases by a factor of\n\u223c 30 between ISCO and the end of ringdown.\nThe fact that all of the eigenvalues increase post-ISCO\n\n\f8\nindicates that the MR portion of the waveform, coupled\nwith the high-frequency response of the LISA instrument,\nprovides information in all directions of parameter space.\nWe might have expected that the merger, with its pronounced peak, would provide a very accurate measurement of tc and only affect other parameters by decreasing their degeneracy with tc . However, Figure 5 demonstrates that this is not the case. If we were to assume\nthat sky localization results primarily from the modulation imposed by LISA's orbit, then we would expect\nthat the merger cannot provide any intrinsic information\nabout sky position, since the LISA constellation remains\neffectively stationary during merger. Figure 5 demonstrates that the interaction between the MR signal and\nthe complex response of the LISA instrument provides\ninformation about every parameter independently. This\nis in addition to any contribution from degeneracy breaking which may occur.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented the first estimates of LISA's ability\nto measure the source parameters of nonspinning, equalmass MBHBs that include a complete inspiral-mergerringdown waveform, realistic LISA orbits, and the full\nhigh-frequency response of the LISA instrument. For systems with Mo = 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 at z = 1, we find that LISA\ncan locate the source on the sky with an error of \u223c 3\narcminutes in the median case at the end of the MBHB\nevent. We have also studied how the sky localization information for these systems evolves with time and find\nthat, at ISCO, the sky localization errors are typically\ntens of arcminutes.\nInspired by the potential for multi-messenger astronomy enabled by combined observations of MBHB mergers\nwith gravitational-wave detectors and electromagnetic\ntelescopes, we have compared the source-localization capabilities of LISA with the FOVs of two future telescopes: LSST and JWST. We find that most systems\nin our ensemble are located within the LSST FOV several months prior to coalescence. Localization within the\nsmaller FOV of JWST requires information from the MR\nwaveform.\nWhile the results in this paper focus on a particular\ninstrument (LISA) and a particular source class (equalmass, nonspinning, Mo = 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , z = 1) they can\nprovide insight for other scenarios as well. For example,\nproposals for lower-cost variants of LISA often involve a\nconstellation with shorter arm lengths [43]. This has the\ngeneral effect of shifting the response of the instrument to\nhigher frequencies. We have asserted that the improve-\n\n[1] E. E. Flanagan and S. A. Hughes, Phys. Rev. D 57, 4535\n(1998).\n\nment in parameter estimation that we observe post-ISCO\nis due in part to the complexity of the high-frequency response of the instrument. If this is true, shortening the\narms could have a significant impact on the ability to\nlocalize systems in the mass range studied. Specifically,\nthe improvement in sky localization from observing the\nmerger-ringdown of a system with Mo \u223c 106 M\u2299 may\nnot be as dramatic as that presented in Section III. At\nthe same time, the decrease in strain sensitivity associated with shorter arms would reduce the duration of the\ninspiral signal that is observed, further degrading measurement performance for these systems. For systems\nwith larger Mo , the situation would be worse.\nFor lower-mass systems, shortening the arms (if the interferometric measurement system is not simultaneously\ndegraded) may actually increase the benefits of observing the merger by increasing the SNR for the mergerringdown portion of the signal. Since these lighter systems have higher merger frequencies, they will still experience a complex response in the detector, even with\nshorter arms. Determining whether this effect can overcome the lower intrinsic SNR of less massive systems will\nrequire a more detailed calculation.\nFinally, we note that while the addition of the mergerringdown signal and a complete detector response is an\nimportant step towards realizing the full potential of\nLISA and other space-based gravitational-wave detectors, we still do not have a complete picture. Other potential sources of information in the MBHB waveform,\nparticularly spin and the associated precession effects,\nhave been demonstrated to significantly improve LISA's\nlocalization ability in the inspiral-only case [7]. It remains to be seen what impact combining spin precession\nand merger will have on LISA sky localization estimates.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Tuck Stebbins for helpful discussions and\nBernard Kelly for his thorough review of the manuscript.\nWe acknowledge the support of NASA grant 08-ATFP080126.
