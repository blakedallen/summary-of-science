[1] and [2]). Because\nof the strong electron phonon coupling in these systems,\nthe experimental signal is usually dominated by phonondrag, hence, apart from the desired electronic transport\ncontributions, the signal also contains a very significant\ncontribution due to details of the electron-phonon interaction. In order to extract the true electronic or \"diffusion\" thermopower, usually drastic approximations have\nto be made [1, 2]. It would thus be very desirable to\nhave an experimental approach that is not influenced by\nphonon-drag effects and directly yields the diffusion thermopower. In this paper we describe the development of\nsuch an experiment.\nWe present direct measurements of the magnetic field\ndependence of the diffusion thermopower using current\nheating techniques in specially designed micro-Hall bar\nstructures. The samples were fabricated from high mobility GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures [\u03bc \u2248 100 m2 /(Vs)]\nusing split-gate techniques. A current passing through an\nelectron channel adjoining the Hall structure is used to\nexclusively heat the electron gas, leaving the lattice temperature unchanged. This current-heating technique has\npreviously been successfully used to determine the diffusion thermopower of mesoscopic systems such as quantum point contacts [3] and quantum dots [4, 5, 6]. The\npresent sample design allows the direct measurement of\nthe tensor components of the thermopower both parallel\n(Sxx ) and perpendicular (Syx ) to the temperature gradient in x-direction. The results are discussed in the\nframework of theoretical models developed for the mag-\n\nnetic field regime where the formation of Landau levels\nleads to a modulation of the density of states [7], but\ndoes not yet induce the formation of edge states. Therefore, the magnetic field in the present study is restricted\nto the low field regime (B \u2264 1.2 T) where the influence\nof the quantum Hall effect can be neglected.\nFig. 1 shows an SEM-photograph of the sample structure, including a schematic diagram of the measurement.\nThe micro-Hall bar and the electron heating channel\nare defined by Schottky-gates, thus forming the quantum point contacts (QPCs), which are used as voltage\nprobes. Gates A, D, E and F form the micro-Hall bar\nand gates A, B, C and D the heating channel. Utilizing\nthe fact that the thermopower of a QPC is quantized\n[3], QPC4 and QPC5 are used to determine the electron temperature in the channel Tch by measuring the\nvoltage drop V25 \u2261 V5 \u2212 V2 across the electron channel, while gates E and F are not defined. We then have\nV25 = (SQP C5 \u2212 SQP C4 )\u2206Tch , where \u2206Tch equals the\ntemperature difference between the electrons in the channel (Tch ) and in the surrounding 2DEG (Tl \u2248 1.6 K),\nwhich is in thermal equilibrium with the crystal lattice:\n\u2206Tch = Tch \u2212 Tl [8]. Note that the temperature difference \u2206Tch enters here rather than a gradient, since\nthe thermovoltage across a QPC can only be measured\nglobally. Experimentally, one observes that \u2206Tch \u221d I 2 ,\nwhere I is the net heating current, as expected from a\nsimple heat balance equation that is valid for not too\nlarge current values [9]. Fig. 2 shows the experimentally\ndetermined thermovoltage as a function of the channel\nheating current. It can be seen that the parabolic dependence is valid for currents up to 12 \u03bcA.

The temperature calibration is given on the right axis of Fig. 2.\nFor a thermopower experiment on the micro-Hall bar,\nQPC4 was adjusted into the tunneling regime (GQP C4 \u2248\n3 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03a9\u22121 < e2 /h). QPC1 , QPC2 and QPC3 were set\nto higher conductance values (GQP C \u2248 10 \u00d7 2e2/h) in order to keep their thermopower minimal (SQP C1,2,3 \u2248 0).\nThe channel current was set to \u223c10 \u03bcA which yields an\nelectron temperature in the channel of Tch \u2248 6.6 K [c.f.\nFig. 2]; this current value gave a good compromise between pronounced thermovoltage signals and the avoidance of lattice heating effects. The inset of Fig. 2 shows\nthe longitudinal resistance of the channel at this current\nlevel of 10 \u03bcA; evidently the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are nearly suppressed, which ensures an approximately constant heat dissipation over the field range\nstudied.\nThe experiments were carried out at a temperature\nof about 1.6 K in an 4 He cryostat equipped with a\n10 T superconducting magnet. The 2DEG carrier density (2.8 \u00d7 1015 m\u22122 ) and mobility (\u2248 100 m2 (Vs)\u22121 )\nwere obtained from Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)\nmeasurements. Standard lock-in amplifier measurement\ntechniques were used to measure the thermoelectric effects. As mentioned above, the 2DEG heating is proportional to I 2 . Using ac-currents (I = i0 cos(\u03c9t)) and\na lock-in detection of the second harmonic (2\u03c9), the\nmeasured signal solely depends on the thermovoltage\n2\n[Vth \u221d I 2 = (i0 cos(\u03c9t)) \u221d i20 cos(2\u03c9t)].\nFig. 1 indicates how the two tensor components of the\n\nFIG. 2: Electron temperature as a function of the channel\nheating current. The solid line with squares represents the\nmeasured data; the dotted line is a parabolic fit. Inset: Suppression of the SdH oscillations in the channel at a heating\ncurrent of 10 \u03bcA. The difference between the dotted line and\nthe minimum of the SdH is about 15%.\n\nthermopower can be obtained in our current heating experiment. First, we note that the thermopower of a 2\nDEG in a magnetic field is a local property, so that the\nthermovoltages we measure are proportional to a temperature gradient, Vth = S\u2207x T dx. We assume that\nthe temperature gradient across the micro-Hall bar coincides with the line 4-2 connecting QPC4 and QPC2\ndefining the x-direction. An important parameter for\nthe experiment is the electron temperature at the crossing of line 4-2 and the line connecting QPC1 and QPC3\n(line 1-3 defining the y-direction). If the electron temperature outside the micro-Hall bar is assumed to be\nequal to the lattice temperature, a temperature gradient is expected to develop between the side which is in\ncontact with the heating channel (Temax \u2248 Tch ) and the\nsurrounding 2DEG (Tl ). In zero order approximation\na constant temperature gradient along the line connecting QPC2 and QPC4 would have the following form:\n\u2207x Te = (Temax \u2212 Tl )/x0 \u2248 5 K/8 \u03bcm = 0.625 K/\u03bcm,\nwhere x0 is the extension of the micro-Hall bar in xdirection (x0 = 8 \u03bcm).\nth\nFrom Fig. 1, it is clear that Vyx\n, the thermovoltage\nperpendicular to the temperature gradient, can be determined by measuring the voltage difference between the\nth\n\u2261 V13 \u2261 V3 \u2212V1 , provided the intrinsic\nareas 1 and 3, Vyx\nthermopower of QPC1 and QPC3 can be neglected. For\nth\nVxx\nhowever, the required voltage probe at the crossing\npoint of the lines 1-3 and 4-2 is not available. Instead,\nth\nwe can obtain Vxx\nfrom measuring the signals present at\nV12 \u2261 V2 \u2212 V1 and V32 \u2261 V2 \u2212 V3 . Since V12 and V23\nth\nth\nth\ncan\n, Vxx\ncontain contributions from Vxx\nas well as Vyx\nbe determined by adding V12 and V23 and subtracting\nth\nth\nth\nV13 \u2261 Vyx\n. This allows us to compare Vxx\nand Vyx\ndirectly without an exact knowledge of \u2207x Te in the micro-\n\n\f3\n4.0\n2.0\n\n0.02\n\nSyx / (mV/K)\n\nSxx / (mV/K)\n\n0.04\n\n0.00\n\n0.0\n-2.0\n\n-0.02\n\n-4.0\n\n-0.04\n\n-6.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nB/T\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0\n\nFIG. 3: Thermopower Sxx parallel to the temperature gradient: The solid line corresponds to the experimental data for\n\u2206T =2.5 K and the dashed dotted line represents the calculation according to Eq. 3.\n\nHall structure.\nFor both components, the experiments show clear oscillations in the thermopower with magnetic field (Figs. 3\nand 4). The thermopower signal has been calculated\nfrom the thermovoltage measurement assuming the linear temperature gradient as mentioned above. The presented field range studied can be separated into two\nparts: First, B < 0.3 T; the electrons are considered as\nclassical particles which are deflected by the applied magnetic field and scattered elastically at the device boundaries (mean free path lmf p \u2248 8 \u03bcm) [10], and second,\n0.3 < B < 1.2 T where the oscillations correspond to the\nformation of Landau levels in the 2DEG and hence to the\nmagnetic field dependent modulation of the density of\nstates. In the following, we will present a detailed quantitative discussion of the second magnetic field regime\n(0.3 < B < 1.2 T).\nAccording to Ref. [7] the magnetic field behaviour of\nthe thermopower oscillations can, in the regime of Landau level formation, be described by the following equations:\n\nSxx\n\nSyx\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c0kB\n=\nD\u2032 (X)\n1 + \u03c9c2 \u03c4 2\ne\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0 2 kB TD\n2\u03c0f\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\nsin\n\u2212\u03c0\nh\u0304\u03c9c\nB\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c0kB\n4\u03c9c \u03c4\nD\u2032 (X)\n=\n1 + \u03c9c2 \u03c4 2\ne\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0 2 kB TD\n2\u03c0f\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\nsin\n\u2212\u03c0\nh\u0304\u03c9c\nB\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere TD is the Dingle temperature, \u03c9c the cyclotron\nfrequency, \u03c4 the transport relaxation time, and f is the\nfrequency of the oscillations (f /B = EF /h\u0304\u03c9c , where EF\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nB/T\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nFIG. 4: Thermopower Syx perpendicular to the temperature\ngradient: The solid line corresponds to the experimental data\nfor \u2206T =2.5 K and the dashed dotted line represents the\ncalculation according to Eq. 4.\n\nis the Fermi energy). The quantity D\u2032 (X) is the derivative of the thermal damping factor D(X), defined by\nD(X) = X/ sinh X where X = 2\u03c0 2 kB T /h\u0304\u03c9c . These\nequations were originally [7] derived for conditions where\n\u03c9c \u03c4 < 1, which would restrict the validity in our case to\nmagnetic fields up to B \u223c 20 mT. However, Coleridge\net al. [12] have shown that Eqs. (3) and (4) are valid up\nto much higher field values (B \u223c 1 T) when localization\neffects can be neglected (as it is the case for high mobility\n2DEGs).\nThe results of the measurements up to 1.2 T are presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 together with fits using\nEqns. (1) and (2). For the fits, the carrier density n\nand the mobility \u03bc were taken from the transport characterization. The Dingle temperature was obtained from\nthe assumption that the quantum mobility is approximately 10 times lower than the electron mobility i.e.\nTD \u2248 10\u03c0/\u03bc \u2248 0.4 K [7, 12]. The thermal smearing was\nfitted by a free parameter T e , which can be interpreted\nas the average electron temperature in the micro-Hall\nbar. The best fits for an average electron temperature of\nT e = 4 K is in very good agreement with the estimates\nmade above concerning the temperature gradient.\nBoth Sxx and Syx can be fitted satisfactorily using\nthe same set of parameters, even though the amplitudes\nare very different. According to Eqns. (3) and (4), the\nratio of the thermopower perpendicular and parallel to\nthe temperature gradient is given by Syx /Sxx = 2\u03c9c \u03c4 .\nFor the present sample, the measured ratio at B = 1\nT is \u2248 120. Again, this value agrees well with the\nexpected value of 160. To our knowledge this is the first\nsuccessful measurement of the diffusion thermopower\nfor a semiconductor 2DEG system. The current heating\napproach allows us to avoid the influence of phonon-drag\neffects [7, 14, 15]. From the consistency of the average\n\n\f4\ntemperatures and the temperature gradients, which are\nobtained from the fitting and the channel temperature\ncalibration, it can be concluded that the chosen geometry and the measurement configuration are suitable for\ninvestigating the diffusion thermopower of high mobility\nsamples.\nSummarizing, the results presented here demonstrate\nthat electron heating techniques can be used to measure\ndirectly the longitudinal and transverse components of\nthe diffusion thermopower. For low magnetic fields, thermopower fluctuations are observed which originate from\nquasi-ballistic electrons; for higher fields, the modulation of the electron density of states due to Landau level\nformation determines the oscillatory part of the diffusion thermopower. Current theories [2, 7] describe this\noscillatory behavior to a large extent and can be used\nto independently gauge the electron temperature. The\nconsistency of these measurements with theory opens up\nthe way for an alternative method for studying the diffusion thermopower in the QHE as well as in the fractional\nquantum Hall effect regime, where currently, experimental data are discussed controversially [1, 16, 17, 18].\nThis work performed with financial support from the\nDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Mo 771/5-2).\n\n[1] R.
