Introduction\nFor a pair of metric spaces (X, dX ) and (Z, dZ ), a mapping h : X \u2192 Z, and a subset\nS \u2286 X, the Lipschitz constant of h on S is denoted\ndZ (h(x), h(y))\ndef\nLipS (h) = sup\n.\ndX (x, y)\nx,y\u2208S\nx6=y\n\nGiven a closed subset Y \u2286 X and a Lipschitz mapping f : Y \u2192 Z, a Lipschitz mapping\nfe : X \u2192 Z is called an absolutely minimal Lipschitz extension (AMLE) of f if its\nrestriction to Y coincides with f , and for every open subset U \u2286 X r Y and every Lipschitz\nmapping h : X \u2192 Z that coincides with fe on X r U we have\n\u0010 \u0011\nLipU (h) > LipU fe .\n(1)\n\nIn other words, fe extends f , and it is not possible to modify fe on an open set in a way that\ndecreases the Lipschitz constant on that set.\nOur main result is:\nTheorem 1. Let X be a locally compact length space and let T be a metric tree. For every\nclosed subset Y \u2286 X, every Lipschitz mapping f : Y \u2192 T has a unique AMLE fe : X \u2192 T .\n\nRecall that a metric space (X, dX ) is a length space if for all x, y \u2208 X, the distance\ndX (x, y) is the infimum of the lengths of curves in X that connect x to y. By a metric tree\nwe mean the one-dimensional simplicial complex associated to a finite graph-theoretical tree\nwith arbitrary edge lengths (i.e., a finite graph-theoretical tree whose edges are present as\nactual intervals of arbitrary length, equipped with the graphical shortest path metric). We\ndid not investigate here the greatest possible generality in which Theorem 1 holds true; in\nparticular, we conjecture that the assumption that X is locally compact can be dropped,\nand that T need not correspond to a finite graph-theoretical tree, but rather can belong to\nthe more general class of bounded R-trees (see [14, 15]). The requirement that X be locally\ncompact is not used in our proof of the uniqueness assertion of Theorem 1.\nA.

The existence part of Theorem 1 was generalized to arbitrary length spaces X and\nT = [a, b] in [37]; see also [21] and [29] for different proofs of this existence result with the\nadditional assumptions that the length space X is separable or compact, respectively. The\nuniqueness part of Theorem 1 was proved in [42] for X a general length space and T = [a, b].\nAdditionally, [42] contains a new (game theoretic) proof of the existence part of Theorem 1\nwhen T = [a, b] and X is a general length space.\nThe purpose of the present article is to initiate the study of absolutely minimal Lipschitz\nextensions of mappings that are not necessarily real-valued, the tree-valued case being the\nfirst non-trivial setting of this type where such theorems can be proved. Our proofs overcome\nvarious difficulties that arise since we can no longer use the order structure of the real line,\nwhich was crucially used in [17, 37, 21, 29, 42]. We also introduce a stochastic game called\nPolitics, related to tree-valued AMLE, that generalizes the stochastic game called Tug of\nWar that was introduced and related to real-valued AMLE in [42].\nIn the remainder of this introduction we explain the relevant background from the classical\ntheory of Lipschitz extension and \u221e-harmonic functions, and also describe the main steps\nof our proof.\n1.1. Background on the Lipschitz extension problem. The classical Lipschitz extension problem asks for conditions on a pair of metric spaces (X, dX ) and (Z, dZ ) which ensure\nthat there exists K \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that for all Y \u2286 X and all Lipschitz mappings f : Y \u2192 Z,\nthere exists fe : X \u2192 Z with fe = f and\nY\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nLipX fe 6 K * LipY (f ).\n\n(2)\n\nStated differently, in the Lipschitz extension problem we are interested in geometric conditions ensuring the existence of fe : X \u2192 Z such that the diagram in (3) commutes, where\n\u03b9 : Y \u2192 X is the formal inclusion, and the Lipschitz constant of fe is guaranteed to be at\nmost a fixed multiple (depending only on the geometry of the spaces X, Z) of the Lipschitz\nconstant of f .\nX\n\u273b\n\nfe\n\n\u03b9\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\u2732\n\nf \u2732\nY\nZ\nNote that if (Z, dZ ) is complete then we can trivially extend f to the closure of Y .\nWhen K = 1 in (2), i.e., when one can always extend functions while preserving their\nLipschitz constant, the pair (X, Z) is said to have the isometric extension property.\nWhen K \u2208 (1, \u221e) the corresponding extension property is called the isomorphic extension\nproperty. The present article is devoted to the isometric extension problem, though we will\nbriefly discuss questions related to its isomorphic counterpart in Section 1.4. We refer to\nthe books [47, 7] and the references therein, as well as the introductions of [30, 40] (and the\nreferences therein), for more background on the Lipschitz extension problem.\n\n\fIt is rare for a pair of metric spaces (X, Z) to have the isometric extension property.\nA famous instance when this does happen is Kirszbraun's extension theorem [24], which\nasserts that if X and Z are Hilbert spaces then (X, Z) have the isometric extension property.\nAnother famous example is the non-linear Hahn-Banach theorem [34], i.e., when Z = R and\nX is arbitrary; this (easy) fact follows from the same proof as the proof of the classical\nHahn-Banach theorem (i.e., by extending to one additional point at a time; alternatively,\none can construct the maximal and minimal isometric extensions explicitly).\nMore generally, one may consider metric spaces Z such that for every metric space X\nthe pair (X, Z) has the isometric extension property (i.e., Z is an injective metric space in\nthe isometric category). This is equivalent to the fact that there is a 1-Lipschitz retraction\nfrom any metric space containing Z onto Z (see [7, Prop. 1.2]); such spaces are called in\nthe literature absolute 1-Lipschitz retracts. It is a well known fact (see [7, Prop. 1.4])\nthat (Z, dZ ) is an absolute 1-Lipschitz retract if and only if (a) Z is metrically convex,\ni.e., for every x, y \u2208 Z and \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] there is z \u2208 Z such that dZ (x, z) = \u03bbdZ (x, y) and\ndZ (y, z) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)dZ (x, y), and (b) Z has the binary intersection property, i.e., if every\ncollection of pairwise intersecting closed balls in Z has a common point. Examples of absolute\n1-Lipschitz retracts are l\u221e and metric trees (see [23, 19]). Additional examples are contained\nin [16] (see also [7, Ch. 1]).\nIf (X, dX ) is path-connected and the pair (X, Z) has the isometric extension property,\nthen the AMLE condition (1) is equivalent to the requirement:\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u2200 open U \u2286 X r Y, LipU fe = Lip\u2202U fe .\n(4)\nWhen Z = R and X = Rn , the AMLE formulation (4) was first introduced by Aronsson [3],\nin connection with the theory of \u221e-harmonic functions. Specifically, it was shown in [3] that\nif fe : Rn \u2192 R is smooth then the validity of (4) is equivalent to the requirement that\nn X\nn\nX\n\u2202 fe \u2202 fe\n\u2202 2 fe\n*\n*\n= 0 on Rn r Y.\n\u2202xi \u2202xj \u2202xi \u2202xj\ni=1 j=1\n\n(5)\n\nIf one interprets (5) in terms of viscosity solutions, then it was proved in [17] that the\nequivalence of (4) and (5) (when Z = R and X = Rn ) holds for general Lipschitz fe. We\nrefer to the survey article [4] and the references therein for more information on the many\nworks that investigate this remarkable connection between the classical Lipschitz extension\nproblem and PDEs.\nExistence of isometric and isomorphic Lipschitz extensions has a wide variety of applications in pure and applied mathematics. Despite this rich theory, the issue raised by Aronsson's seminal paper [3] is that even when isometric Lipschitz extension is possible, many such\nextensions usually exist, and it is therefore natural to ask for extension theorems ensuring\nthat the extended function has additional desirable properties. In particular, the notion of\nAMLE is an isometric Lipschitz extension which is locally the \"best possible\" extension. In\nthis context, one can ask for (appropriately defined) \"AMLE versions\" of known Lipschitz\nextension theories. As a first step, in light of Theorem 1 it is tempting to ask the following:\nQuestion 1. Let Z be an absolute 1-Lipschitz retract. Is it true that for every length space\nX and every closed subset Y \u2286 X, any Lipschitz f : Y \u2192 Z admits an AMLE fe : X \u2192 Z?\n3\n\n\fNote that unlike the situation when Z is a metric tree, in the setting of Question 1 one\ncannot expect in general that the AMLE will be unique: consider for example Z = l2\u221e , i.e.,\nthe absolute 1-Lipschitz retract R2 , equipped with the l\u221e norm. Let X = R and Y = {0, 1}.\nThe 1-Lipschitz mapping f : Y \u2192 l2\u221e given by f (0) = (0, 0), f (1) = (1, 0) has many AMLEs\nfe : R \u2192 l2\u221e , since for every 1-Lipschitz function g : R \u2192 R with g(0) = 0, g(1) = 1, the\nmapping x 7\u2192 (x, g(x)) will be an AMLE of f . At the same time, by using the existence\nof real-valued AMLEs coordinate-wise, the answer to Question 1 is trivially positive when\nZ = l\u221e (\u0393) for any set \u0393.\nWhile we do not give a general answer to Question 1, we show here that general absolute\n1-Lipschitz retracts Z do enjoy a stronger Lipschitz extension property: Z-valued functions\ndefined on subsets of vertices of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes associated to unweighted\nfinite graphs admit isometric Lipschitz extensions which are \u221e-harmonic. This issue, together with the relevant definitions, is discussed in Section 1.2 below. In addition to being\ncrucially used in our proof of Theorem 1, this result indicates that absolute 1-Lipschitz retracts do admit enhanced Lipschitz extension theorems that go beyond the simple existence\nof isometric Lipschitz extensions (which is the definition of absolute 1-Lipschitz retracts). At\nthe same time, we describe below a simple example indicating inherent difficulties in obtaining a positive answer to Question 1 beyond the class of metric trees (and their l\u221e -products).\n1.2. \u221e-harmonic functions and AMLEs on finite graphs. Let G = (V, E) be a finite\nconnected (unweighted) graph. We shall consider G as a 1-dimensional simplicial complex,\ni.e., the edges of G are present as intervals of length 1 joining their endpoints. This makes G\ninto a length space, where the shortest-path metric is denoted by dG . Given a vertex v \u2208 V\ndenote its neighborhood in G by NG (v), i.e., NG (v) = {u \u2208 V : uv \u2208 E}.\nLet (Z, dZ ) be a metric space. We shall say that a function f : V \u2192 Z is \u221e-harmonic at\nv \u2208 V if there exist u, w \u2208 NG (v) such that\ndZ (f (u), f (v)) = dZ (f (w), f (v)) = max dZ (f (z), f (v)),\n\n(6)\n\ndZ (f (u), f (w)) = 2 max dZ (f (z), f (v)).\n\n(7)\n\nz\u2208NG (v)\n\nand\nz\u2208NG (v)\n\nf : V \u2192 Z is said to be \u221e-harmonic on W \u2286 V if it is \u221e-harmonic at every v \u2208 W .\nThe connection to AMLEs is simple: for \u03a9 \u2286 V and f : \u03a9 \u2192 Z, if fe : G \u2192 Z is an\nAMLE of f then fe must be geodesic on edges, i.e., for u, v \u2208 V with uv \u2208 E, if x \u2208 G is\na point on the edge uv at distance \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] from u, then dZ (f (x), f (u)) = \u03bbdZ (f (u), f (v))\nand dZ (f (x), f (v)) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)dZ (f (u), f (v)) (apply (4) to the open segment joining u and\nv). Moreover, if G is triangle-free, then fe is \u221e-harmonic on V r \u03a9. This follows from\nconsidering in (4) the open set U \u2286 G consisting of the union of the half-open edges incident\nto v \u2208 V r \u03a9 (including\n\u0010 \u0011 v itself). The vertices u, w \u2208 NG (v) = \u2202U in (6) will be the\npoints at which Lip\u2202U fe is attained. The restriction that G is triangle-free implies that\n\ndG (u, w) = 2, using which (7) follows from (4).1\n1In\n\nthe above reasoning the assumption that G is triangle-free can be dropped if Z is a metric tree. But,\nthis is not important for us: we only care about G as a length space, and therefore we can replace each\nedge of G by a path of length 2, resulting in a triangle-free graph whose associated 1-dimensional simplicial\ncomplex is the same as the original simplicial complex, with distances scaled by a factor of 2.\n4\n\n\fThe converse to the above discussion is true for mappings into metric trees. This is\ncontained in Theorem 2 below, whose simple proof appears in Section 4. A local-global\nstatement analogous to Theorem 2 fails when the target (geodesic) metric space is not a\nmetric tree, as we explain in Remark 1 below.\nGiven a metric tree T , a finite graph G = (V, E) and a function f : V \u2192 T , the linear\ninterpolation of f is the T -valued function defined on the 1-dimensional simplicial complex\nassociated to G as follows: given an edge e = uv \u2208 E and x \u2208 e with dG (x, u) = \u03bbdG (u, v) and\ndG (x, v) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)dG (u, v), the image f (x) \u2208 T is the point on the geodesic joining f (u) and\nf (v) in T with dT (f (x), f (u)) = \u03bbdT (f (u), f (v)) and dT (f (x), f (v)) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)dT (f (u), f (v)).\nTheorem 2. Let T be a metric tree and G = (V, E) a finite connected (unweighted) graph.\nAssume that \u03a9 \u2286 V and that f : V \u2192 T is \u221e-harmonic on V r \u03a9. Then the linear\ninterpolation of f is an AMLE of f |\u03a9 .\nRemark 1. Consider the example depicted in Figure 1, viewed as a 12 vertex graph G with\nvertices\nV = {A, B, C, X, Y, Z} \u222a {Si }6i=1\nand edges\nE = {XS3 , S3 A, AS2 , S2 B, AS4 , S4 C, BS6 , S6 C, ZS5 , S5 C, Y S1 , S1 B}.\n\n(The role of the vertices {Si }6i=1 is just to subdivide edges so that the graph will be trianglefree.) The picture in Figure 1 can also be viewed as a mapping f : V \u2192 R2 . Denoting\n\u03a9 = {X, Y, Z}, this mapping is by construction \u221e-harmonic on V r \u03a9. In spite of this fact,\nthe linear interpolation of f is not an AMLE of f |\u03a9 . Indeed, consider the open set U = Gr\u03a9.\nSince the planar Euclidean distance between any two of the points f (X), f (Y ), f (Z) is\nstrictly less than 3 (=the distance between any two of the vertices {X, Y, Z} in G), we have\nLip\u2202U (f ) = Lip{X,Y,Z}(f ) < 1. At the same time, by considering the vertices A, B, C we see\nthat LipU (f ) = 1.\nX\nS3\n\n1\nA\n\n1\n\nY\n\nS1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nS2\n\nS4\nS6\n\nB\n\nC\n\n1\nS5\n\n1\nZ\n\nFigure 1. An example of an \u221e-harmonic function which isn't an AMLE.\nIn Section 4 we show that absolute 1-Lipschitz retracts have a stronger Lipschitz extension\nproperty, namely they admit \u221e-harmonic extensions for functions from finite graphs:\n5\n\n\fTheorem 3. Assume that (Z, dZ ) is an absolute 1-Lipschitz retract and that G = (V, E)\nis a finite connected (unweighted) graph. Fix \u03a9 \u2286 V and f : \u03a9 \u2192 Z. Then there exists a\nmapping fe : V \u2192 Z which is \u221e-harmonic on V r \u03a9 such that\n\u0010 \u0011\nfe = f and LipV fe = Lip\u03a9 (f ).\n\u03a9\n\nThe existence part of Theorem 1 is deduced in Section 5 from Theorem 3 via a compactness\nargument that relies on a comparison-based characterization of AMLE that we establish in\nSection 2. The uniqueness part of Theorem 1 is proved via a topological argument (and the\nresults of Section 2) in Section 3.\n1.3. Tug of War and Politics. In the special case when T \u2286 R is an interval, Theorem 1\nwas proved in [42] without the local compactness assumption using a two-player, zero-sum\nstochastic game called Tug of War. We expect that one could adapt the arguments in [42]\nand the game called Politics (introduced below) to give a proof of Theorem 1 that does\nnot use local compactness; however, this would involve rewriting large sections of [42] in a\nsignificantly more complicated way, and we will not attempt to do this here.\nTug of War is a two-player, zero-sum stochastic game. In this game, one starts with\nan initial point x0 \u2208 X r Y ; then at the kth stage of the game, a fair coin is tossed and\nthe winner gets to choose any xk \u2208 X with |xk \u2212 xk\u22121 | < \u03b5. Informally, the winning player\n\"tugs\" the game position up to \u03b5 units in a direction of her choice. The game ends the first\ntime K that xK \u2208 Y , and player one collects a payoff of f (xK ) from player two. It was\nshown that as \u03b5 \u2192 0, the value of the game (informally, the amount the first player wins in\nexpectation when both players play optimally; see Section 6) tends to fe(x0 ). In addition to\nits usefulness in proofs, the game theory provides a deeper understanding of what an AMLE\nis. Although AMLEs are often difficult to compute explicitly, one can always provide upper\nand lower bounds by giving explicit strategies for the game and showing that they guarantee\na certain expected payoff for one player or the other. It is therefore natural to ask for an\nanalog of Tug of War that makes sense when T is not an interval.\nSince fe(x0 ) is a point in T , however, and not in R, it is not immediately obvious how\nfe(x0 ) can represent a value for either player. We will solve this problem by augmenting the\nstate space of the game to include declared \"targets\" tk , ok \u2208 T as well as \"game positions\"\nxk \u2208 X. Before explaining this, we remark that one obtains a slight generalization of Tug\nof War by letting xk be vertices of any (possibly infinite) graph with vertex set X and\nY \u2286 X. One then requires that xk and xk\u22121 be adjacent in that graph (instead of requiring\n|xk \u2212 xk\u22121 | < \u03b5). We now introduce the game of Politics in a similar setting.\nLet G = (V, E) be an unweighted undirected graph which may have self loops. Fix Y \u2286 V\nand a mapping f : Y \u2192 T . Begin with an initial game position x0 \u2208 V r Y and an initial\n\"target\" t0 \u2208 T . At the kth round of the game, the players determine the values (xk , tk ) as\nfollows:\n(1) Player I chooses an \"opposition target\" ok \u2208 T and collects dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) units from\nplayer II.\n(2) Player II chooses a new target tk \u2208 T and collects dT (ok , tk ) units from player I.\n(3) A fair coin is tossed and the winner of the toss chooses a new game position xk \u2208 X\nwith {xk\u22121 , xk } \u2208 E.\n6\n\n\fThe total amount player I gains at each round is dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) \u2212 dT (ok , tk ). Similarly, player\nII gains dT (ok , tk ) \u2212 dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) at each round. The game ends after round K, where K\nis the smallest value of k for which xk \u2208 Y . At this point player I collects an additional\ndT (f (xk ), tk ) units from player II. (If the game never ends, we declare the total payout for\neach player to be zero.)\nThe game is called \"Politics\" because we may view it as a model for a rather cynical zerosum political struggle in which f (xK ) represents a \"political outcome,\" but both parties care\nonly about their own perceived political strength, and not about the actual outcome. We\nthink of the target as representing the \"declared political objective\" of player II; the terminal\npayoff rule, makes it clear that player II would prefer f (xK ) be close to this declared target\n(in order to \"appear successful\"). Player II is allowed to adjust the target during each\nround, but loses points for moving her target closer to the declared opposition target ok\n(because \"making a concession\" makes her appear weak) and gains points for moving her\ntarget further from the opposition target because \"taking a harder line\" makes her appear\nstrong). 2\nWe will prove the following for finite graphs:\nProposition 4. Fix a finite graph G = (V, E), some Y \u2286 V , a metric tree T , and a function\nf : Y \u2192 T . View G as a length space (with all edges having length one) and let fe : G \u2192 T\nbe the AMLE of f . Then the value of the game of Politics with these parameters and initial\nvertex x0 \u2208 V r Y is given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndT fe(x0 ), t0 .\n\nProposition 4 will be proved in Section 6. An extension of Proposition 4 to infinite graphs\n(via the methods of [42]) is probably possible, but we will not attempt it here.\n\n1.4. Some open questions and directions for future research. It would be of interest\nto understand known isometric extension theorems in the context of the AMLE problem.\nSpecifically, we ask:\nQuestion 2. Is there an AMLE version of Kirszbraun's extension theorem, i.e, is it true\nthat for every pair of Hilbert spaces H1 , H2 and every closed subset Y \u2286 H1 , any Lipschitz\nmapping f : Y \u2192 H2 admits an AMLE fe : H1 \u2192 H2 ?\nWe refer to the manuscript [44] for a discussion of subtleties related to Question 2, as\nwell as some partial results in this direction. Examples of additional isometric extension\ntheorems that might have AMLE versions are contained in [45, 46, 47, 27, 39].\nThe study of isomorphic extensions in the context of the AMLE problem is wide open.\nSince when Lipschitz extension is possible a constant factor loss is usually necessary, and\nsince isomorphic extensions suffice for many applications, it would be of interest if some\nisomorphic extension theorems had \"almost locally optimal\" counterparts. For example, one\n2There\n\nis a more player-symmetric variant of this game in which each player, upon moving a target, earns\nthe net change in the distance from the opponent's target. That is, player II earns dT (ok , tk ) \u2212 dT (ok , tk\u22121 )\nwhen choosing tk (so player I earns dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) \u2212 dT (ok , tk )) and player I earns dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) \u2212 dT (ok\u22121 , tk\u22121 )\nwhen choosing ok . In fact, by combining like terms, modifying the end-of-game payout function, and defining\no0 = t0 , one can make this game equivalent to the one described above but with twice the total payout.\n7\n\n\fmight ask for the existence of a constant K > 0 such that one can extend any mapping\nf : Y \u2192 Z to a mapping fe : X \u2192 Z so that for every open U \u2286 X r Y we have\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0011\nLipU fe 6 K * Lip\u2202U fe .\n(8)\n\nExamples of isomorphic extension results that could be studied in the context of the AMLE\nproblem include [31, 32, 18, 20, 5, 43, 25, 9, 30, 40, 8, 36, 22, 26]. Unlike isometric extension theorems, isomorphic extension theorems cannot be done \"one point at time\", since\nna\u0131\u0308vely the constant factor losses at each step would accumulate. For this reason, isomorphic extension theorems usually require methods that are very different from their isometric\ncounterparts. One would therefore expect that entirely new approaches are necessary in\norder to prove AMLE versions of isomorphic extension.\n\n1.5. Possible applications. The image processing literature makes use of real-valued AMLEs as a technique for image inpainting and surface reconstruction - see [11, 1, 35, 10].\nSince many data sets in areas ranging from computer science to biology have a natural tree\nstructure, it stands to reason that problems involving reconstruction/interpolation of missing\ntree-valued data could be similarly approached using tree valued AMLEs.\nTree-valued AMLEs may also be useful for problems that do not involve trees a priori.\nTo give a simple illustration of this, suppose we have a two-dimensional surface S embedded\nin R3 that separates an \"inside\" from an \"outside,\" but such that on some open W \u2286 R3\nthe shape of the surface is not known. Let d(x) be the signed distance of x from S (i.e., the\nactual distance if x is on the outside and minus that distance if x is on the inside). If we\ncan compute or approximate d(x) outside of of W , then the extension of d(x) to W has a\nzero set that can be interpreted as a \"reconstructed\" approximation to S. This approach\nand related methods are explored in [10].\nIf instead of a single \"inside\" and \"outside\" there were three or more regions of space\nmeeting at a point v, and the union S of the interfaces between these regions was unknown\nin a neighborhood\nW of v, then we could use the same approach but replace R with the\nS\nmetric tree \u03c9i [0, \u221e) \u2286 C for some complex roots of unity \u03c9i , and let d(x) be \u03c9i (when x\nis in the ith region) times the distance from x to S. A similar technique could be used for\ninpainting a two-dimensional image comprised of a small number of monochromatic regions.\nIndeed, for such problems, it is not clear how one could apply the AMLE method without\nusing trees.\n2. Comparison formulation of absolute minimality\nWe take the following definition from [12] (see also [17, 13] for the case X = Rn ). Let U\nbe an open subset of a length-space (X, dX ) and let f : U \u2192 R be continuous. Then f is\nsaid to satisfy comparison with distance functions from above on U if for every open\nW \u2286 U, z \u2208 X r W , b > 0 and c \u2208 R we have the following:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2200 x \u2208 \u2202W f (x) 6 b dX (x, z) + c =\u21d2 \u2200 x \u2208 W f (x) 6 b dX (x, z) + c .\n(9)\nThe function f is said to satisfy comparison with distance functions from below on\nU if the function \u2212f satisfies comparison with distance functions from above on U, i.e., for\n8\n\n\fevery open W \u2286 U, z \u2208 X r W , b > 0 and c \u2208 R we have the following:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2200 x \u2208 \u2202W f (x) > \u2212b dX (x, z) + c =\u21d2 \u2200 x \u2208 W f (x) > \u2212b dX (x, z) + c .\n\n(10)\n\nFinally, f satisfies comparison with distance functions on U if it satisfies comparison\nwith distance functions from above and from below on U. We cite the following:\nProposition 5 ([12]). Let U be an open subset of a length space. A continuous f : U \u2192 R\nsatisfies comparison with distance functions on U if and only if it is an AMLE of f |\u2202U .\nRemark 2. The definition of comparison with distance functions from above would not\nchange if we added the requirement that z 6\u2208 \u2202W ; if (9) or (10) fails and z \u2208 \u2202W , then it\nwill fail (with a modified c) when W is modified to include some neighborhood of z. The\ndefinition would also not change if we required b > 0. If (9) or (10) fails with b = 0, then it\nfails for some sufficiently small b\u2032 > 0.\nWe will need to have an analog of the above definition with the real line R replaced with\nT . The definition makes sense when T is any metric space, but we will only use it in the\ncase when T is a metric tree. We say f : U \u2192 T satisfies T -comparison on U if for every\nt \u2208 T , the function x 7\u2192 dT (t, f (x)) satisfies comparison with distance functions from above\non U. This generalizes comparison with distance functions:\nProposition 6. If T is the closed interval [t1 , t2 ] \u2286 R, then f : U \u2192 T satisfies T -comparison\non U if and only if it satisfies comparison with distance functions on U.\nProof. If f satisfies T -comparison on U, then the mappings x 7\u2192 dT (t1 , f (x)) = f (x) \u2212 t1\nand x 7\u2192 dT (t2 , f (x)) = t2 \u2212 f (x) satisfy comparison with distance functions from above on\nU, hence f and \u2212f both satisfy comparison with distance functions from above. Conversely,\nif f satisfies comparison with distance functions on U, then for all t \u2208 [t1 , t2 ] the mapping\nx 7\u2192 dT (f (x), t) = (f (x) \u2212 t) \u2228 (t \u2212 f (x)) satisfies comparison with distance functions from\nabove because it is a maximum of two functions with this property.\n\u0003\nProposition 5 also has a natural generalization, which is contained in Proposition 7 below.\nNote that the proof of this generalization uses the assumption that T is a metric tree in the\n\"only if\" direction; for the \"if\" direction T can be any metric space.\nProposition 7. Let U be an open subset of a length space (X, dX ), and let (T, dT ) be a\nmetric tree. A continuous function f : U \u2192 T satisfies T -comparison on U if and only if it\nis an AMLE of f |\u2202U .\nProof. We will first suppose, to obtain a contradiction, that f is not an AMLE of f |\u2202U , but\nsatisfies T -comparison. Then there is an open W \u2286 U such that LipW (f ) > Lip\u2202W (f ). That\nis, there is a path P in X connecting points x and y in W whose length L satisfies\ndT (f (x), f (y))\n> Lip\u2202W (f ).\nL\n\n(11)\n\nIf y1 and y2 are the first and last times P hits \u2202W , dT (f (y1 ), f (y2)) 6 Lip\u2202W (f ) * dX (y1 , y2 );\nhence the property (11) holds for either the portion of P between x and y1 or the portion\nbetween y2 and y. Thus, we may take P to be entirely contained in W ; replacing P with a\n9\n\n\fslightly shorter sub-path of P , we may assume the endpoints of P are both in W as well,\nand that P is some positive distance \u03b4 from \u2202W . Set\ndT (f (x), f (y))\n> Lip\u2202W (f ).\nL\nWe may then find x1 arbitrarily close to some fixed point x0 along P satisfying\ndef\n\nm=\n\ndT (f (x0 ), f (x1 ))\n> m > Lip\u2202W (f ).\ndX (x0 , x1 )\nNow we consider the distance function mdX (x0 , *). We will compare it to the function\ndT (f (x0 ), f (*)). Since the latter is at least as large as the former at the point x1 , T -comparison\nimplies that it must be at least as large at some point on \u2202W . This implies that for any\n\u03b5 > 0 we may find a z \u2208 \u2202W where\ndef\n\nm\u2032 =\n\ndT (f (x0 ), f (z))\n> m \u2212 \u03b5.\ndX (x0 , z)\n\n\u0001\nIn particular, we may assume m\u2032 > Lip\u2202W (f ). Next choose m\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Lip\u2202W (f ), m\u2032 . Consider\nthe distance function m\u2032\u2032 dX (z, *) and compare it to dT (f (z), f (*)). Since the functions are\nequal at z and the latter is larger than the former at x0 , the latter must be larger than the\nformer at some point w \u2208 (\u2202W ) r {z}. But this implies\ndT (f (z), f (w))\n> Lip\u2202W (f ),\ndX (z, w)\na contradiction.\nWe now proceed to the converse. Note that since T is a bounded metric space, by intersecting U with a large ball it suffices to prove the converse when U is bounded. Suppose, to\nobtain a contradiction, that f is an AMLE of f |\u2202U and does not satisfy T -comparison on U.\nSince f does not satisfy T -comparison on U, there exists an open W \u2286 U, a point x0 \u2208\n/W\nand c \u2208 R, b > 0, such that for some t \u2208 T we have dT (t, f (x)) 6 bdX (x0 , x) + c for all\nx \u2208 \u2202W , yet dT (t, f (y)) > bdX (x0 , y) + c for some y \u2208 W . Write F (z) = bdX (x0 , z) + c. We\nmay replace W with the connected component of {x \u2208 W : dT (t, f (x)) > F (x)} containing\ny, so that one has dT (t, f (x)) = F (x) at the boundary of W . By looking at a nearly-shortest\npath from y to x0 , we deduce that LipW (f ) > b. If we could also show that Lip\u2202W (f ) = b\n(which is trivially the case when T \u2286 R, but not for a more general metric tree T ) we would\nhave a contradiction to the AMLE property of f . Instead of proving this for the particular\nW constructed above, we will show that there exists a smaller W for which the analogous\nstatement holds.\nConsider the function\ndef\nG(s) =\nsup dT (t, f (x)),\nx\u2208W\ndX (x0 ,x)=s\n\nwhich is defined on the interval [s1 , s2 ], where s1 and s2 are the infimum and supremum of\nthe set {dX (x0 , x) : x \u2208 W }, respectively. By assumption G(s) lies above the line bs + c for\nsome s \u2208 [s1 , s2 ], though not for s1 and s2 . Hence, if we define\n\b\ndef\nM = sup G(s) \u2212 bs \u2212 c : s \u2208 [s1 , s2 ]\n10\n\n\fthen M > 0. Write\ndef\n\nS =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n\u0001\n\u03c3 \u2208 [s1 , s2 ] : lim sup G(s) \u2212 bs \u2212 c = M\ns\u2192\u03c3\ns\u2208[s1 ,s2 ]\n\ndef\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n\n,\n\nand note that S is a nonempty closed subset of [s1 , s2 ], so that s0 = inf S \u2208 S.\nFor \u03b5 > 0 and x \u2208 X define\ndef\n\nF\u03b5 (x) = (b + \u03b5)dX (x0 , x) + M + c \u2212 \u03b5s0 \u2212 \u03b52 ,\n\nand\n\ndef \b\nW\u03b5 = x \u2208 W : dT (t, f (x)) > F\u03b5 (x) .\n\nObserve that W\u03b5 6= \u2205 for all \u03b5 > 0. To see this fix \u03b4 > 0. Since s0 \u2208 S there exists s \u2208 [s1 , s2 ]\nsuch that |s \u2212 s0 | 6 \u03b4 and G(s) \u2212 bs \u2212 c > M \u2212 \u03b4. By the definition of G(s), there is\nz0 \u2208 W satisfying dX (z0 , x0 ) = s and G(s) 6 dT (t, f (z0 )) + \u03b4. Since f is continuous at z0 ,\nthere is \u03b7 \u2208 (0, \u03b4) such that if dX (z, z0 ) < \u03b7 then dT (f (z), f (z0 )) < \u03b4. Take z \u2208 W with\ndX (z, z0 ) < \u03b7.

The following claim contains additional properties\nof the sets W\u03b5 that we will use later.\nClaim 8. The open sets {W\u03b5 }\u03b5>0 have the following properties:\n(1) If 0 < \u03b51 < \u03b52 then W\u03b51 \u2286 W\u03b52 ,\n(2) lim\u03b5\u21920 supx\u2208W\u03b5 dX (x0 , x) \u2212 s0 = 0,\n(3) lim\u03b5\u21920 supx\u2208W\u03b5 dT (t, f (x)) \u2212 (M + bs0 + c) = 0.\n\nProof. Fix 0 < \u03b51 < \u03b52 and x \u2208 W\u03b51 . Write s = dX (x0 , x). Since dT (t, f (x)) > F\u03b51 (x), we\nhave G(s)\u2212bs\u2212c > \u03b51 s+M \u2212\u03b51 s0 \u2212\u03b521 . By the definition of M, this implies that s 6 s0 +\u03b51 .\nHence,\ndT (t, f (x)) > (b + \u03b51 )s + M + c \u2212 \u03b51 s0 \u2212 \u03b521 = F\u03b52 (x) + (\u03b52 \u2212 \u03b51 )s0 + \u03b522 \u2212 \u03b521 \u2212 (\u03b52 \u2212 \u03b51 )s\n> F\u03b52 (x) + (\u03b52 \u2212 \u03b51 )s0 + \u03b522 \u2212 \u03b521 \u2212 (\u03b52 \u2212 \u03b51 )(s0 + \u03b51 ) = F\u03b52 (x) + \u03b52 (\u03b52 \u2212 \u03b51 ) > F\u03b52 (x).\n\nThus x \u2208 W\u03b52 , proving the first assertion of Claim 8.\nTo prove the second assertion of Claim 8, note that we have already proved above that if\nx \u2208 W\u03b5 then dX (x0 , x) 6 s0 + \u03b5. Thus, if the second assertion of Claim 8 fails there is some\n\u03b4 > 0 and a sequence {\u03b5n }\u221e\nn=1 \u2286 [0, 1] with limn\u2192\u221e \u03b5n = 0, such that for each n \u2208 N there is\n11\n\n\fzn \u2208 W\u03b5n with dX (zn , x0 ) 6 s0 \u2212 \u03b4. Write \u03c3n = dX (zn , x0 ), and by passing to a subsequence\nassume that limn\u2192\u221e \u03c3n = \u03c3\u221e exists. Then \u03c3\u221e 6 s0 \u2212 \u03b4 and,\n\u0001\nlim sup G(\u03c3n ) \u2212 b\u03c3n \u2212 c > lim sup dT (t, f (zn )) \u2212 b\u03c3\u221e \u2212 c > lim sup F\u03b5n (zn ) \u2212 b\u03c3\u221e \u2212 c\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u0001\n= lim sup (b + \u03b5n )\u03c3n + M + c \u2212 \u03b5n s0 \u2212 \u03b52n \u2212 b\u03c3\u221e \u2212 c = M.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThus \u03c3\u221e \u2208 S. But since \u03c3\u221e 6 s0 \u2212 \u03b4, this contradicts the choice of s0 as the minimum of\nS. The proof of the second assertion of Claim 8 is complete. The third assertion of Claim 8\nnow follows, since if x \u2208 W\u03b5 then by writing s = dX (x, x0 ) we see that\nb(s \u2212 s0 ) > [(G(s) \u2212 bs \u2212 c) \u2212 M] + b(s \u2212 s0 ) > dT (t, f (x)) \u2212 (M + bs0 + c)\n\n> F\u03b5 (x) \u2212 (M + bs0 + c) = b(s \u2212 s0 ) + \u03b5s \u2212 \u03b5s0 \u2212 \u03b52 .\n\nThus\nsup dT (t, f (x)) \u2212 (M + bs0 + c) 6 b sup dX (x0 , x) \u2212 s0 + \u03b5s0 + \u03b52 ,\nx\u2208W\u03b5\n\nx\u2208W\u03b5\n\nand therefore the third assertion of Claim 8 follows from the second assertion of Claim 8. \u0003\nWe are now in position to conclude the proof of Proposition 7. Let V be the the set\nof vertices of the metric tree T . We claim that for all \u03b5 > 0 such that \u03b5s0 + \u03b52 6 M we\nhave f (W\u03b5 ) \u2229 V 6= \u2205 (recall that by our assumption we have M > 0). Indeed, if x \u2208 \u2202W\u03b5\nthen either dT (t, f (x)) = F\u03b5 (x) or x \u2208 \u2202W . In the latter case, by assumption we have\ndT (t, f (x)) 6 bdX (x0 , x) + c 6 F\u03b5 (x), where the last inequality follows from \u03b5s0 + \u03b52 6 M.\nThus, by the definition of W\u03b5 , the function f does not satisfy T -comparison on W\u03b5 . Since\nf is an AMLE of f |\u2202U , Proposition 5, combined with Proposition 6, now implies that f |W\u03b5\nmust take values in V .\nT\nDue to part (1) of Claim 8, there exists v \u2208 V such that v \u2208 \u03b5>0 W\u03b5 . Let W\u03b5\u2032 be\nthe connected component of W\u03b5 whose image under f contains v. By part (3) of Claim 8,\nfor \u03b5 small enough we have f (W\u03b5\u2032 ) \u2229 V = {v}. Since, by the definition of W\u03b5 and the\nconnectedness of W\u03b5\u2032 , for x \u2208 \u2202W\u03b5\u2032 we have dT (t, f (x)) = F\u03b5 (x), by considering a nearlyshortest path from a point in W\u03b5\u2032 to x0 we see that LipW\u03b5\u2032 (f ) > b + \u03b5. Since f is an\nAMLE of f |\u2202U , it follows that Lip\u2202W\u03b5\u2032 (f ) > b + \u03b5. This implies that there are distinct\nx\u03b5 , y\u03b5 \u2208 \u2202W\u03b5\u2032 such that dT (f (x\u03b5 ), f (y\u03b5)) > (b + \u03b5)dX (x\u03b5 , y\u03b5 ). But, since dT (t, f (x\u03b5 )) = F\u03b5 (x\u03b5 )\nand dT (t, f (y\u03b5 )) = F\u03b5 (y\u03b5 ), it must be the case that the\nfrom t of both f (x\u03b5 ) and\nT distance\n\u2032\nf (y\u03b5 ) is at least their distance from v. Indeed, if t \u2208 \u03b5>0 f (W\u03b5 ) then it would follow from\npart (3) of Claim 8 that t = v, and there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, for \u03b5 small enough\nt\u2208\n/ f (W\u03b5\u2032), and therefore, since T is a tree, if at least one of the points f (x\u03b5 ), f (y\u03b5) is closer\nto t than to v then the points t, f (x\u03b5 ), f (y\u03b5 ) all lie on the same geodesic in T , implying that:\ndT (f (x\u03b5 ), f (y\u03b5)) = dT (t, f (x\u03b5 )) \u2212 dT (t, f (y\u03b5 )) = |F\u03b5 (x\u03b5 ) \u2212 F\u03b5 (y\u03b5 )|\n\n= (b + \u03b5) dX (x0 , x\u03b5 ) \u2212 dX (x0 , y\u03b5 ) 6 (b + \u03b5)dX (x\u03b5 , y\u03b5 ),\n\na contradiction to the choice of x\u03b5 , y\u03b5 .\nHaving proved that both f (x\u03b5 ) and f (y\u03b5) lie further away from t than v, if we consider a\nnearly shortest-path between x\u03b5 and y\u03b5 , it must include points x1 , x2 \u2208 W\u03b5\u2032 such that f (x1 )\n12\n\n\fand f (x2 ) lie on the same component I of T r V - on the other side of v from t - and\nsatisfy\ndT (f (x1 ), f (x2 ))\n> (b + \u03b5).\n(12)\ndX (x1 , x2 )\nSuppose that f (x1 ) is closer to t that f (x2 ). Note that\ndT (f (x1 ), f (x\u03b5 )) = dT (t, f (x\u03b5 )) \u2212 dT (t, f (x1 )) 6 F\u03b5 (x\u03b5 ) \u2212 F\u03b5 (x1 )\n\n\u0001\n= (b + \u03b5) dX (x0 , x\u03b5 ) \u2212 dX (x0 , x1 ) 6 (b + \u03b5)dX (x\u03b5 , x1 ).\n\nMoreover, if f (x) = x1 then trivially dT (f (x1 ), f (x)) 6 (b + \u03b5)dX (x1 , x). Thus, if we let\nJ \u2286 I be the open interval joining f (x\u03b5 ) and f (x1 ), then dT (f (x1 ), f (*)) 6 (b + \u03b5)dX (x1 , *)\non \u2202 (f \u22121 (J) \u2229 W\u03b5\u2032 ). By (12) we now have a violation of T -comparison on f \u22121 (J), which\ncontradicts Proposition 5.\n\u0003\n3. Uniqueness\nIn this section we prove the uniqueness half of Theorem 1 (which does not require the\nlocally compact assumption) as Lemma 12 below. Before doing so, we prove some preliminary\nlemmas.\nLemma 9. Suppose that X is a length space, that Y \u2286 X is closed, that f : Y \u2192 R is\nLipschitz and bounded, and that fe : X \u2192 R is the AMLE of f . (Existence and uniqueness of\nfe are proved in [42].) Suppose that g : X \u2192 R is another bounded and continuous extension\nof f , and that for some fixed \u03b4 > 0, this g satisfies comparison with distance functions from\nabove on every radius \u03b4 ball centered in X r Y . Then g 6 fe on X.\n\nProof. This is proved (though not explicitly stated) in [42]. Precisely, it is shown there that\nfor \u03b5 > 0, the comparison with distance functions from above on balls of radius larger than\n2\u03b5 implies that the first player in a modified tug of war game (with game position vk and\nstep size \u03b5) can make g(vk ) a submartingale until the termination of the game, which in turn\nimplies that g 6 f\u03b5 where f\u03b5 is the value of this game. It is also shown that lim\u03b5\u21920 f\u03b5 = fe\nholds on X. Taking \u03b5 \u2192 0 (and noting 2\u03b5 < \u03b4 for small enough \u03b5) gives g 6 fe.\n\u0003\nThe following was proved in [2, Lem. 5]. The statement in [2] was only made for the special\ncase X \u2286 Rn , but the (short) proof was not specific to Rn . For completeness, we copy the\nproof from [2], adapted to our notation. We will vary the presentation just slightly - using\nsuprema over open balls instead of maxima over closed balls - because in our context (since\nwe do not assume any kind of local compactness) maxima of continuous functions on closed\nballs are not necessarily obtained.\n\nLemma 10. Let (X, dX ) be a length space, x0 \u2208 X and \u03b5 > 0.

First we claim that M is path-length preserving. That is, if b\n\u03b3 is any rectifiable path\ndef\nb\nin X then \u03b3 = M \u25e6 b\n\u03b3 is a rectifiable path of the same length in X.

Since the length of \u03b3b is the total variation of L \u25e6 b\n\u03b3 (and the latter is finite), the\ngeneral statement can be derived by approximating b\n\u03b3 with paths for which L \u25e6 b\n\u03b3 is piecewise\nmonotone. To do this, first note that one can take an increasing set of times 0 = t0 , t1 , . . . , tk\nsuch that the total variation of L \u25e6 \u03b3b restricted to those times is arbitrarily close to the\nunrestricted total variation. Then the length of \u03b3 traversed between times tj and tj+1 is at\ndef\nleast r = |L \u25e6 b\n\u03b3 (tj ) \u2212 L \u25e6 \u03b3b(tj+1 )| - this is because the longer of the two paths b\n\u03b3 (tj ) and\n\u03b3 (tj+1 ) contains a segment of length at least r that is not part of the other, and \u03b3 must\nb\ntraverse all the points of that segment in order (or in reverse order) somewhere between\ntimes tj and tj+1 .\n\u0010 \u0011\nc\u2286X\nb r Yb and note that W def\nc is also open.

The pair (g(*), h(*))\nmay then be viewed as a map from X r Y to\ndef\n\nT = {(t1 , t2 ) \u2208 T \u00d7 T : t1 6= t2 }.\nWe will use this map to define a certain pair of real-valued functions on X.\nTo this end, consider an arbitrary continuous function P : [0, 1] \u2192 T . Define functions\nt1 , t2 : [0, 1] \u2192 T by writing (t1 (s), t2 (s)) = P (s). Let I((t1 , t2 )) denote the geodesic joining\nt1 and t2 in T . For every s \u2208 [0, 1], we will define an isometry \u03a8Ps from I(P (s)) to an interval\n(a1 (s), a2 (s)) of R, sending t1 to a1 (s) and t2 to a2 (s). Clearly, the values of a1 (s) and a2 (s)\ndetermine the isometry, and for each s, we must have\na2 (s) \u2212 a1 (s) = dT (t1 (s), t2 (s)).\nHowever, the latter observation only determines a1 (s) and a2 (s) up to the addition of a single\nconstant to both values. This constant is determined by the following requirements:\n(1) a1 (0) = 0.\n(2) For each fixed t \u2208 T , the function s 7\u2192 \u03a8Ps (t) is constant on every connected interval\nof the (open) set {s \u2208 [0, 1] : t \u2208 I(P (s))}.\n\nInformally, at each time s, the geodesic I(P (s)) is \"glued\" isometrically to the interval\n(a1 (s), a2 (s)) \u2286 R. As s increases, if t1 and t2 move closer to each other, then points are\nbeing removed from the ends of I(P (s)), and these points are \"unglued\" from R. As t1 and\nt2 move further from each other, new points are added to the geodesic and these new points\nare glued back onto R.\nWhen P \u2032 and P are paths in T as above, write P \u223c P \u2032 if P (0) = P \u2032 (0) and P (1) = P \u2032(1)\n\u2032\nand for each s \u2208 [0, 1] we have I(P (s)) \u2229 I(P \u2032(s)) 6= \u2205. We claim that in this case \u03a8P1 = \u03a8P1 .\nNote that given s and t \u2208 I(P (s)) \u2229 I(P \u2032(s)), requirement (2) above implies that \u03a8Ps and\n\u2032\n\u03a8Ps agree up to additive constant on a neighborhood of s; namely, they must agree on the\n\u2032\nconnected component of {s\u2032 : t \u2208 I(P (s)) \u2229 I(P \u2032 (s))} containing s. Since \u03a8Ps and \u03a8Ps agree\nup to additive constant on an open neighborhood of every s \u2208 [0, 1], they must be equal up\nto additive constant throughout the interval, and requirement (1) above implies that this\nconstant is zero.\n\u2032\nA corollary of this discussion is that \u03a8P1 = \u03a8P1 whenever P and P \u2032 are homotopically\nequivalent paths in T . To obtain this, it is enough to observe that if P r is a homotopy, with\n\u2032\nr \u2208 [0, 1] and P = P 0 , P \u2032 = P 1 , then for each r \u2208 [0, 1] we have P r \u223c P r for all r \u2032 in some\nr\nneighborhood of r. This implies that \u03a8P1 (as a function of r) is constant on a neighborhood\nof each point in [0, 1], hence constant throughout [0, 1].\nSince we are assuming X r Y is simply connected, we can fix a point x0 \u2208 X r Y\nand define the pair (a1 (x), a2 (x)) to be the value (a1 (1), a2 (1)) obtained above by taking\nP (s) = (g(p(s)), h(p(s))) where p : [0, 1] \u2192 X is any path from x0 to x. For y in some\nneighborhood of each x \u2208 X rY , and for some t \u2208 T , we have that a1 (y) is an affine function\nof dT (t, f (y)). For this, it suffices to take a neighborhood and a t such that t \u2208 I(P (s))\nthroughout that neighborhood and use requirement (2) above. In this neighborhood, T comparison implies that a1 satisfies comparison with distance functions from below and a2\nsatisfies comparison with distance functions from above.\n17\n\n\fNow let C be the Lipschitz constant of f , and for \u03b4 > 0 write\ndef\n\nU\u03b4 = {x : a1 (x) < a2 (x) + 2C\u03b4} .\nWe claim that the argument in the paragraph just above implies that a2 satisfies comparison\nwith distance functions from above on B(x, \u03b4) for any x \u2208 U\u03b4 . To see this, first observe that\nthe fact that a2 is Lipschitz with constant at most C implies that B(x, \u03b4) \u2286 X r Y , and\nthen take t to be the midpoint in T between g(x) and h(x), noting that since g and h are\nboth Lipschitz with constant C, we have that t is on the geodesic between g(x\u2032 ) and h(x\u2032 )\nfor all x\u2032 \u2208 B(x, \u03b4).\nWe may now apply Lemma 9 (where the Y of the lemma statement is chosen so that\nU\u03b4 = X r Y ) to see that a2 6 e\na2 on U\u03b4 , where e\na2 is the AMLE of the restriction of a2 to\n\u2202U\u03b4 . By symmetry, we may apply the same arguments to \u2212a1 to obtain that a1 > e\na1 on U\u03b4 .\nSince a1 < a2 by construction, we now have\ne\na1 6 a1 < a2 6 e\na2 .\n\n(19)\n\nNow it is a standard fact (see [4]) about AMLE that the suprema and infima of a difference\nof AMLEs (in this case e\na2 \u2212 e\na1 ) is obtained on the boundary set (in this case \u2202U\u03b4 ). This\nimplies that e\na1 6 e\na2 6 e\na1 + 2C\u03b4 throughout the set U\u03b4 . By (19), we now have that\nsup |a1 (x) \u2212 a2 (x)| 6 2C\u03b4\n\nx\u2208U\u03b4\n\nThis implies supx\u2208X |a1 (x) \u2212 a2 (x)| 6 2C\u03b4, and since this holds for all \u03b4 > 0, we have a1 = a2\nthroughout X, a contradiction.\n\u0003\n4. Proofs of Theorem 2 and Theorem 3\nWe first present the simple proof of Theorem 2, i.e, the local-global result for tree-valued\n\u221e-harmonic functions. The proof is a modification of an argument in [42] from the setting\nof real-valued mappings to the setting of tree-valued mappings.\nProof of Theorem 2. Let U \u2286 G r \u03a9 be an open subset of G. Denote\nL = LipU (f ) = max\n\nx,y\u2208U\nx6=y\n\ndT (f (x), f (y))\n.\ndG (x, y)\n\n(20)\n\nLet x, y \u2208 U be points at which the maximum in (20) is attained and dG (x, y) is maximal\namong all such points. We will be done if we show that x, y \u2208 \u2202U. Assume for the sake of\ncontradiction that x \u2208 U (the case y \u2208 U being similar).\nIf x is in the interior of an edge of G, we could move x slightly along the edge and increase\ndG (x, y) without decreasing dT (f (x), f (y))/dG(x, y). So, assume that x \u2208 V . The fact that f\nis \u221e-harmonic on V r\u03a9 \u2287 {x} means that there exist u, v \u2208 NG (x) with dT (f (u), f (v)) = 2L\nand f (x) is a midpoint between f (u) and f (v) in T . Since x \u2208 U (and f is linear on the\nedges of G) there exists \u03b5 > 0 and zu , zv \u2208 U such that zu \u2208 xu \u2208 E, zv \u2208 xv \u2208 E,\ndG (x, zu ) = dG (x, zv ) = \u03b5 and f (zu ) (resp. f (zv )) is the point on the geodesic in T joining\nf (x) and f (u) (resp. f (v)) at distance L\u03b5 from f (x). Because T is a metric tree, either\ndT (f (x), f (zu )) = dT (f (x), f (y)) + L\u03b5 or dT (f (x), f (zv )) = dT (f (x), f (y)) + L\u03b5. Assume\nwithout loss of generality that dT (f (x), f (zu )) = dT (f (x), f (y))+L\u03b5 = L(dG (x, y)+\u03b5). Then\n18\n\n\fdG (zu , y) = dG (x, y) + \u03b5 and dT (f (zu ), f (y))/dG(zu , y) = L, contradicting the maximality of\ndG (x, y).\n\u0003\nAs in the classical proof that metric convexity and the binary intersection property implies\nthe isometric extension property (see [7, Prop. 1.4]), for the proof of Theorem 3 we shall\nconstruct fe by extending to one additional point at a time. The proof of Theorem 3 relies\non a specific choice of the ordering of the points for the purpose of such a point-by-point\nconstruction. Our argument uses a variant of an algorithm from [28].\nProof of Theorem 3. Write |V r \u03a9| = n. We shall construct inductively a special ordering\nw1 , . . . , wn of the points of V r \u03a9, and extend f to these points one by one according to this\nordering. Assume that w1 , . . . , wk have been defined, as well as the values fe(w1 ), . . . , fe(wk ) \u2208\nZ (if k = 0 this assumption is vacuous).\nWrite \u03a90 = \u03a9 and \u03a9k = \u03a9 \u222a {w1 , . . . , wk }. Given distinct x, y \u2208 V we shall say that\nx0 , x1 , . . . xl \u2208 V is a path joining x and y which is external to \u03a9k if x0 = x, xl = y, and for\nall i \u2208 {0, . . . , l \u2212 1} we have xi xi+1 \u2208 E and {xi , xi+1 } 6\u2286 \u03a9k . Let dk (x, y) be the minimum\nover l \u2208 N such that there exists a path x0 , x1 , . . . xl \u2208 V joining x and y which is external to\n\u03a9k . If no such path exists we set dk (x, y) = \u221e. We also set dk (x, x) = 0 for all x \u2208 V . Then\ndk : V \u00d7 V \u2192 {0} \u222a N \u222a {\u221e} clearly satisfies the triangle inequality and dk (*, *) > dG (*, *)\npointwise.\nWe distinguish between two cases:\nCase 1. For all distinct x, y \u2208 \u03a9k we have dk (x, y) = \u221e. In this case order the points\nof V r \u03a9k arbitrarily, i.e., V r \u03a9k = {wk+1 , . . . , wn }. If w \u2208 {wk+1, . . . , wn } then by the\nconnectedness of G, there exists a path in G joining w and some point xw \u2208 \u03a9k . Note that\nxw is uniquely determined by w, since if there were another path joining w and some point\nyw \u2208 \u03a9k which isn't xw then dk (xw , yw ) < \u221e, contradicting our assumption in Case 1. We\ncan therefore define in this case fe(w) = fe(xw ).\nCase 2. for some distinct x, y \u2208 \u03a9k we have dk (x, y) < \u221e. In this case define\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndZ fe(x), fe(y)\nLk = max\n.\nx,y\u2208\u03a9k\ndk (x, y)\n\n(21)\n\nx6=y\n\nOur assumption\u0010 implies that\n\u0011 Lk > 0. Choose x, y \u2208 \u03a9k that are distinct and satisfy\nLk dk (x, y) = dZ fe(x), fe(y) . Write l = dk (x, y) and let x0 , x1 , . . . xl \u2208 V be a path joining\nx and y which is external to \u03a9k . Then x1 \u2208\n/ \u03a9k , so we may define wk+1 = x1 .

We\nclaim that fe is \u221e-harmonic on V r \u03a9. To see this note that for all x, y \u2208 V the sequence\n{dk (x, y)}nk=1 \u2286 {0} \u222a N \u222a {\u221e} is non-decreasing.

If a, b \u2208 \u03a9k then it follows from\nthe definition of Lk that Lk+1 6 Lk , since dk+1 (a, b) > dk (a, b). By symmetry, it remains to\ndeal with the case\n\u0010 a \u2208 \u03a9k and b =\u0011wk=1 . In\u0010 this case, since by our\n\u0011 construction we have\ne\ne\ne\nf (wk+1) \u2208 BZ f (a), Lk dk (a, wk+1 ) \u2286 BZ f (a), Lk dk+1(a, wk+1 ) , it follows once more\nthat Lk+1 6 Lk .\nFix k \u2208 {0, . . . , n\u22121}. If fe(wk+1) was defined in Case 1 of our inductive construction, then\nfe is constant on NG (wk+1 ) \u222a {wk+1 }, in which fact the \u221e-harmonic conditions (6), (7) for fe\nat wk+1 hold trivially. If, on the other hand, fe(wk+1 ) was defined in Case\u00102 of our inductive\n\u0011\nconstruction, then there exist distinct x, y \u2208 \u03a9k with Lk dk (x, y) = dZ fe(x), fe(y) , such\nthat for l = dk (x, y) there are x0 , x1 , . . . xl \u2208 V which form a path joining x and y which is\nexternal to \u03a9k , and x1 = wk+1 .

(33)\n\nBy uniform convergence, for every \u03b4 > 0 there exists n0 \u2208 N such that for every n > n0 if\nfor every x \u2208 \u2202W we have\ndT (t, f \u2217 (x)) 6 bdX (x, z) + c,\n\n(34)\n\n\u0001\ndT t, f\u03b5\u2217n (x) 6 bdX (x, z) + c + \u03b4.\n\n(35)\n\nthen for every x \u2208 \u2202W we have\n\nAssume from now on that (34) holds for all x \u2208 \u2202W . Let V\u03b5n \u2286 N\u03b5n be the set of\n\u221a\nu \u2208 N\u03b5n \u2286 \u039b\u03b5n for which there exists w \u2208 W such that dX (u, w) 6 \u03b5n . Define W\u03b5n to\nbe the open subset of the 1-dimensional simplicial complex corresponding to the graph G\u03b5n\nconsisting of the union of all the half-open intervals [u, v), where u, v \u2208 \u039b\u03b5n , uv is an edge\nof G\u03b5n and u \u2208 V\u03b5n . Any point v \u2208 \u2202W\u03b5n of the boundary of W\u03b5n in G\u03b5n is at dX -distance\n\u221a\n\u221a\ngreater than \u03b5n from W , but at dX -distance at most \u03b5n from some point of N\u03b5n whose\n\u221a\ndX -distance from W is at most \u03b5n . Thus\n\u221a\nv \u2208 \u2202W\u03b5n =\u21d2 dX (u, \u2202W ) 6 2 \u03b5n .\n\n(36)\n\nLet z\u03b5n be any one of the dX -closest points of z in N\u03b5n . By (30) and the definition of N\u03b5n\nwe have\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(37)\ndX (z\u03b5n , z) 6 \u03b5n + \u03b5n 6 2 \u03b5n .\n22\n\n\fSince f\u03b5\u2217n is Lipschitz with constant LipY (f )(1 + C), for every v \u2208 \u2202W\u03b5n we have\ndT t, f\u03b5\u2217n (v)\n\n\u0001\n\n(35)\u2227(36)\n\n6\n(37)\n\n6\n(31)\n\n6\n6\n\n\u221a\nbdX (v, z) + c + \u03b4 + 2LipY (f )(1 + C) \u03b5n\n\u221a\nbdX (v, z\u03b5n ) + c + \u03b4 + 2(LipY (f )(1 + C) + b) \u03b5n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nb \u03b5n dG\u03b5n (v, z\u03b5n ) + c + \u03b4 + (2LipY (f )(1 + C) + 2b + bC) \u03b5n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nb \u03b5n dG\u03b5n (v, z\u03b5n ) + c + \u03b4 + K \u03b5n ,\n(38)\n\n/ W we have\nwhere K > 0 is independent of n. Observe that if z\u03b5n \u2208 W\u03b5n then since z \u2208\n\u221a\ndX (z\u03b5n , \u2202W ) 6 6 \u03b5n . In this case the same argument as above shows that (38) holds for\nv = z\u03b5n as well (with a different value of K). Thus, the bound (38) holds for all v \u2208\n\u2202(W\u03b5n r {z\u03b5n }). By Theorem 2 and Proposition 7, it follows that for every v \u2208 W\u03b5n r {z\u03b5n },\nand hence also for all v \u2208 V\u03b5n , we have\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndT t, f\u03b5\u2217n (v) 6 b \u03b5n dG\u03b5n (v, z\u03b5n ) + c + \u03b4 + K \u03b5n\n\n\u221a\nbdX (v, z) + c + \u03b4 + (K + Cb + 2b) \u03b5n . (39)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nSince any point of W is at dX -distance at most \u03b5n + \u03b5n 6 2 \u03b5n from V\u03b5n , and since f\u03b5\u2217n is\nLipschitz with constant independent of n, we see from (39) that for some K \u2032 > 0 independent\nof n, for all x \u2208 W we have:\n\u0001\n\u221a\ndT t, f\u03b5\u2217n (x) 6 bdX (x, z) + c + \u03b4 + K \u2032 \u03b5n .\n(40)\n(31)\u2227(37)\n\n6\n\nLetting n tend to \u221e in (40), it follows that\n\ndT (t, f \u2217 (x)) 6 bdX (x, z) + c + \u03b4.\n\n(41)\n\nSince (41) holds for all \u03b4 > 0, we have proved the desired implication (33).\nWhen X is locally compact but not necessarily compact, the proof of Theorem 13 follows\nfrom a direct reduction to the compact case. Indeed, by Remark 2 it suffices to prove (33)\nwhen b > 0. In this case, since T is bounded, the upper bounds in (33) are trivial if dX (x, z)\nis sufficiently large. Thus, it suffices to prove (33) for the intersection of W with a large\nenough ball centered at z.\n\u0003\n6. Politics\nIn this section we prove Proposition 4. We require some notation (in particular, a definition\nof value) to make the statement of Proposition 4 precise.\nA strategy for a player is a way of choosing the player's next move as a function of all\npreviously played moves and all previous coin tosses. It is a map from the set of partially\nplayed games to moves (or in the case of a random strategy, a probability distribution\non moves). We might expect a good strategy to be Markovian, i.e., a map from the current\nstate to the next move, but it is useful to allow more general strategies that take into account\nthe history.\nGiven two strategies SI , SII , let F (SI , SII ) be the expected total payoff (including the\nrunning payoffs received) when the players adopt these strategies. We define F to be some\nfixed constant C if the game does not terminate with probability one, or if this expectation\ndoes not exist.\n23\n\n\fThe value of the game for player I is defined as supSI inf SII F (SI , SII ). The value for\nplayer II is inf SII supSI F (SI , SII ). The game has a value when these two quantities are\nequal. It turns out that Politics always has a value for any choice of initial states x0 \u2208 V and\nt0 \u2208 T ; this is a consequence of a general theorem (since the payoff function is a zero-sum\nBorel-measurable function of the infinite sequence of moves [33]; see also [41] for more on\nstochastic games).\nProof of Proposition 4. First we introduce some notation: when the game position\nis at x\u0011k ,\n\u0010\ne\nwe let yk and zk denote two of the vertices adjacent to xk that maximize dT f (xk ), fe(*) ,\nchosen so that fe(xk ) is the midpoint of fe(yk ) and fe(zk ). Write for x \u2208 V ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndef\n\u03b4(x) = sup dT fe(x), fe(y) ,\ny\u2208NG (x)\n\nand\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne\ne\ne\ne\nMk = \u03b4(xk ) = dT f (xk ), f (yk ) = dT f (xk ), f (zk ) .\n\u0010\n\u0011\nUsing this notation, we now give a strategy for player II that makes d fe(xk ), tk plus the\ntotal payoffnthus far for Player\no I a supermartingale. Player II always chooses tk to be the\nelement in fe(yk\u22121), fe(zk\u22121 ) on which dT (*, ok ) is largest; if she wins the coin toss, she then\nchooses xk to be so that fe(xk ) is that element. To establish the supermartingale property,\nwe must show that, regardless of player I's strategy, we have\nh\ni\nh \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011i\ne\ne\nE dT (ok , tk ) \u2212 dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) > E dT f (xk ), tk \u2212 dT f (xk\u22121 ), tk\u22121 .\n(42)\ndef\n\nIt is not hard to see that we have deterministically\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne\ne\ndT (ok , tk ) \u2212 dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) > dT f (xk\u22121 ), tk \u2212 dT f (xk\u22121 ), tk\u22121 .\n\n(43)\n\nn\no\ne\nIndeed, if ok and tk\u22121 are in distinct components of T r f (xk\u22121 ) , then the same will be\ntrue n\nof ok andotk , and (43) holds as equality; if ok and tk\u22121 are in the nsame component\nof\no\nT r fe(xk\u22121 ) then ok and tk will be in opposite components of T r fe(xk\u22121 ) , and the\nleft hand side minus the right hand side of (43) becomes twice the distance from fe(xk\u22121 ) of\nthe least common ancestor of ok and and tk\u22121 in the tree rooted at fe(xk\u22121 ).\nDue to (43), in order to prove (42) it is enough to show that\nh \u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011i\nE dT fe(xk ), tk \u2212 dT fe(xk\u22121 ), tk 6 0,\nwhich is clear since if player II wins the coin toss this quantity will be \u2212Mk and if player I\nwins the coin toss it will be at most Mk .\n\u0010\n\u0011\nNext we give a very similar strategy for player I that makes dT fe(xk ), tk plus the total\npayoff thus far for Player\nI a submartingale.\nIn this strategy, Player I always chooses ok\nn\no\nto be the element in fe(yk\u22121 ), fe(zk\u22121 ) on which dT (*, tk\u22121 ) is largest; if he wins the coin\n24\n\n\ftoss, he then chooses xk to be so that fe(xk ) is that element. To establish the submartingale\nproperty, we must now show that\nh\ni\nh \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011i\nE dT (ok , tk ) \u2212 dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) 6 E dT fe(xk ), tk \u2212 dT fe(xk\u22121 ), tk\u22121 .\n(44)\n\ne\nNote that by strategy definition\n\u0010 ok is on the\n\u0011 opposite side of f (xk\u22121 ) from tk\u22121 , so we may\nwrite dT (ok , tk\u22121 ) = Mk + dT fe(xk\u22121 ), tk\u22121 . Plugging this into (44), what we seek to show\nbecomes\nh\ni\nh \u0010\n\u0011i\nE dT (ok , tk ) \u2212 Mk 6 E dT fe(xk ), tk ,\n(45)\n\nwhich we see by noting that the right hand side of (45) is equal to dT (ok , tk ) when player I\nwins the coin toss (and\u0010makes fe(x\n\u0011 k ) = ok ) and at least dT (ok , tk ) \u2212 2Mk when player II wins\nthe coin toss, since dT fe(xk ), ok 6 2Mk for any valid choice of xk .\nTo conclude the proof, we need to modify the strategy in such a way that forces the game\nto terminate without sacrificing the payoff\n\u0010 expectation. \u0011If both players adopt the above\nstrategy, it is clear that the increments dT fe(xk\u22121 ), fe(xk ) are non-decreasing, and that the\ndistance from any fixed endpoint of the tree has at least probability 1/2 of increasing at each\nstep; from this, it follows that the length of game play is a random variable with exponential\ndecay. If the other player makes other moves, which are not optimal from the point of view\nof optimizing the payoff, then we can wait until the cumulative amount the other player\nhas \"given up\" is greater that twice the diameter of T , and then force the game to end by\nplacing a target at a single point and subsequently always moving xk closer to that point\nwhen winning a coin toss. (The loss from the sub-optimality of this strategy is less than the\ngain from the amount the other player gave up.) If a player adopts this strategy, then the\ntotal time duration of the game is a random variable whose law decays exponentially; this\nyields the uniform integrability necessary for the sub-martingale optional stopping theorem,\nwhich implies Proposition 4.\n\u0003\nReferences\n\n[1] A.
