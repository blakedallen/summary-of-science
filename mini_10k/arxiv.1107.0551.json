The carbons atoms\nin graphene are arranged into a honeycomb structure which is consistent of the two inequivalent\ntriangular sublattices, say A and B [2]. Electrons in graphene can hop to the nearest neighbours\natoms which leads to the formation of the two energy bands, each containing the same number of\nstates [3] and touching each other at the two inequivalent points called Dirac points, say K+ and K\u2212 .\nAround these points the energy dispersion relation of graphene is linear in momentum which implies\nthat its low energy excitations mimic the ultra relativistic massless particles. Thus, the low energy\nexcitations of graphene are described by the following Dirac-like equation:\nH = vF \u03c3.p\n\n(1)\n\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity and \u03c3=(\u03c3x , \u03c3y ) is the Pauli matrices vector with \u03c3i , i = x, y, z, the i\nPauli matrix. The above equation implies that the electrons in graphene behave as massless charged\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nElectronic mail: rezakord@ipm.com\nElectronic mail: Dariush110@gmail.com\n\n1\n\n\fDirac fermions confined in a 2D space, an interesting feature that real particles do not exhibit because\nall the massless elementary particles happen to be electrically neutral. These massless electrons shows\npeculiar properties which massive relativistic carriers do not exhibit [4]. In fact the first experimental\nevidence that revealed the charged carriers in graphene mimic massless electrons was an unusual\nquantum Hall effect reported in 2005 [5]. In spite of this fact that charge carriers in graphene exhibit\na four fold degeneracy (which comes from the real spin of electrons in addition to another factor of\ntwo, due to the equal contributions of the K-valleys, i.e. K+ and K\u2212 ) we see that in experiments\ninstead of quantization of the Hall conductivity in multiples of\n\u03c3xy = 4n\n\ne2\nh\n\nn \u2208 {..., \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, ...}\n\n(2)\n\nit is observed that Hall conductivity is:\n1 e2\ne2\n\u03c3xy = 4(n + ) = 4\u03bd ,\n2 h\nh\n\n1\n\u03bd = (n + ),\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhich shows that the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE), appears in half-integers. It is also observed that unlike to the quantum Hall effect for 2D conventional systems which appears in the strong\nmagnetic field and low temperature limit, the IQHE in graphene can be observed even at the room\ntemperature [6]. This is because of ultra-relativistic nature of its charge carriers which mimic the\nmassless Dirac fermions. These massless charge carriers as we'll show later, contrary to the conventional 2D systems, show interesting results under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We, before\ndiscussing the effect of a constant magnetic field B = Bz perpendicular to the graphene's plane, note\nthat even for conventional 2D systems, the periodic potential due to the host lattice is of no relevance\nto the quantum Hall problem because the size of the electron wave packet in a magnetic field is much\nlarger than the lattice period. The periodic potential due to the lattice is, therefore, neglected in\nstudies of the quantum Hall effect, however if one considers to calculate the Landau levels based on\nthe tight-binding model, the commensurability problem between the magnetic flux and lattice unit\ncell is needed to be considered. This problem is known to inevitably occur in the two dimensional\nelectron system [7-9]. However, interestingly for graphene the periodic potential of the honeycomb\nlattice is already built-in and therefore it is counted in the massless Dirac-like equation. Thus, we do\nnot really need to incorporate explicitly the periodic potential term into the Dirac equation.\nNow, in order to obtain the energy spectrum of graphene in the presence of a uniform magnetic field\nwhich is considered to be perpendicular to the garphene's plane, by choosing the symmetric gauge\nand taking the units such that c = 1, the single valley Hamiltonian of graphene can be written as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\n\u03a0x \u2212 i\u03a0y\nH = vF\n,\n(4)\n\u03a0x + i\u03a0y\n0\nwhere\n\u03a0 = \u2212ih\u0304(\u2202x \u2212\n\niy\nix\n, \u2202y + 2 ),\n2\n2l\n2l\n\nl2 =\n\nh\u0304\nB|e|\n\n(5)\n\nThen, one may write the equation (4) in the form of the following eigenvalue equation:\n(ih\u0304\u2202t + ih\u0304vF \u03c3x \u03a0x + ih\u0304vF \u03c3y \u03a0y )\u03a8K+ (r, t) = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nNext, multiplying the above equation by \u03c3z (the z-component of Pauli matrix) gives:\n(ih\u0304\u03b3\u0302 0 \u2202t + ih\u0304vF \u03b3\u0302 1 \u03a0x + ih\u0304vF \u03b3\u0302 2 \u03a0y )\u03a8K+ (r, t) = 0,\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\fwith the \u03b3\u0302 matrices as:\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3\u0302 =\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\n, \u03b3\u0302 =\n\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n, \u03b3\u0302 =\n\n0 \u2212i\n\u2212i 0\n\n\u0013\n.\n\nHere in order to solve the equation (7), we split the 2-spinor \u03a8K+ into its sublattice parts:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE\n\u03c6\n\u03a8K+ (r, t) =\nei h\u0304 t ,\n\u03c8\nwhich inserting it into the equation (7) leads us to the following expression:\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u03c6\n0 S\n,\n=\n\u03c8\nD 0\n\u2212\u03c8\u0307\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere S and D are given by:\nS = \u2212vF (\u2202x \u2212\n\niy\nix\n) + ivF (\u2202y + 2 ),\n2\n2l\n2l\n\n(11)\n\niy\nix\n) + ivF (\u2202y + 2 ).\n(12)\n2\n2l\n2l\nThere is no need to say that from equation (10) one can obtain the following second order differential\nequations:\nD = vF (\u2202x \u2212\n\n\u03c6\u0308 = \u2212SD\u03c6,\n\n(13)\n\n\u03c8\u0308 = \u2212DS\u03c8,\n\n(14)\n\nwhich by introducing the following dimensionless quantities:\nx\u2192x\ne=\n\nx\n,\nl\n\ny \u2192 ye =\n\ny\n,\nl\n\n(15)\n\nwe can solve the them with respect to \u03c6 and \u03c8. In order to do so, we first need to make the following\nansatz:\n\u03c6(r, t) = e\u2212iEt/h\u0304 \u03c6(r),\n\n(16)\n\n\u03c8(r, t) = e\u2212iEt/h\u0304 \u03c8(r),\n\n(17)\n\nand\n\nwhich plugging them in the equations (13) and (14) yields:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh\u03042 vF2\nye 2\nx\ne 2\n1\n2\n(\u2212i\u2202xe \u2212 ) + (\u2212i\u2202ye + ) \u00b1 2 .\nE = 2\nl\n2\n2\nl\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the positive (minus) sign corresponds to the solution for \u03c6 (\u03c8). Transforming to the complex\ncoordinates:\nz=x\ne \u2212 ie\ny , z\u0304 = x\ne + ie\ny,\n(19)\n3\n\n\fgives the equation (18) as follows:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh\u03042 vF2\n1\nE = 2\n\u22124\u2202z \u2202z + zz + z\u2202z \u2212 z\u2202z \u00b1 1\nl\n4\n2\n\n(20)\n\nAt this point, we can define the ladder operators \u00e2\u2020 and \u00e2 as:\n1 z\u0304\n\u00e2\u2020 = \u221a ( \u2212 2\u2202z ),\n2 2\n\n1 z\n\u00e2 = \u221a ( + 2\u2202z\u0304 ),\n2 2\n\n(21)\n\nwhich from them, one can write the solution for \u03c6 in the following form:\nE2 =\n\ni\n2h\u03042 vF2 h \u2020\n\u00e2\n\u00e2\n+\n1\n,\nl2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere N\u0302 = \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2, with the eigenvalues n=0,1,..., is the number operator. While for \u03c8, we obtain the\nfollowing solution:\nE2 =\n\n2h\u03042 vF2 \u2020\n\u00e2 \u00e2.\nl2\n\n(23)\n\nHere, the two solutions could be packed in one equation as:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh\u03042 vF2\n1\n2\nE = 2\n2(n + ) \u00b1 1\nl\n2\n\n(24)\n\nAt this point one can express the square of the Hamiltonian (4) in terms of the number operator N\u0302 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2h\u03042 vF2\nN\u0302 + 1 0\n2\nH =\n,\n(25)\nl2\n0\nN\u0302\nwith the following eigenstates and eigenvalues for H:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n|n \u2212 1i\n\u03a8n,K+ = \u221a\n,\n\u00b1|ni\n2\n\nEn = \u00b1\n\nh\u0304vF \u221a\n2n\nl\n\n(26)\n\nIt is clear that for n 6= 0 we have one pairs of eigenstates and eigenvalues but for n = 0 (corresponding\nto E = 0) we have:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\n\u03a80,K+ =\n(27)\n|0i\nIt is clear that the solution corresponding to the K+ (K\u2212 ) point1 shows that the probability for the\nelectrons to be on the sublattice A (B) is zero. Thus, the zero solution corresponding to K+ (K\u2212 )\nimplies the localization of Dirac fermions on the B (A) sublattice. In the original experimental paper\nit is argued that since in all the n 6= 0 energy levels both pseudospin states are filled, whereas in the\nn = 0 level only one is, the density of states in the latter case is 1/2 that of the other levels and\ne2\ntherefore it contributes only 2h\nper spin/valley.\nThe above argument does not seem entirely satisfactory, since, as it is clear from general solutions\n1\n\nThe corresponding eigenstate for K\u2212 is \u03a80,K\u2212 =\n\n\u0012\n\n|0i\n0\n\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n\f(26), any given eigenstate is normalized to one irrespective of whether one pseudospin component is\ne2\nzero or not. Hence the half contribution ( 2h\n) of the zero energy mode corresponding to the single\nvalley index could not be explained in this way because, as we see from the normalized eigenstates,\nelectrons localize on just one sublattice, instead of being contributed half on the sublattice A and half\non the sublattice B.\nThere are another explanation for observation of half-integer quantum Hall effect that says since for\nn = 0 we have only one solution (as there is no difference between +|0i and \u2212|0i) the degeneracy of\nthis level is half of the other energy levels for which there exist two solutions. What is wrong about\nthis conclusion is that existence of just one solution for n = 0 level (and two for others), does not\nsimply mean that its degeneracy is twice smaller because one of the two solutions corresponds to the\nnegative energy states (holes) and another to the positive energy states (electrons). Therefore this\nassumption could be disregarded.\nAnother explanation might be based on this assumption that the level n = 0 is equally shared by\nelectrons and holes, meaning that it is half filled with electrons and half with the holes, since there\nis no difference between +|0i and \u2212|0i in this level [10]. In the other words the ground state energy\nlevel is completely filled with the same types of fermions except the fact that they only differ by their\ncharge which does not prevent them from being subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. It is by now\nthat one can say the n = 0 energy level contributes 1/2(e2 /h). Hence, as for the other levels two kind\nof fermions (holes and electrons) with the same number of states contribute in the conductance, they\ncontribute twice of 1/2(e2 /h) per spin/valley.\nThe interesting feature that zero energy solutions exhibit, motivate us to seek zero energy modes by\nexamining the effect of other types of magnetic fields on graphene's energy spectrum. In fact, when\nthe strength of the magnetic field is high the ground state energy level is occupied by more and more\nelectrons because the degeneracy of the levels increase and therefore the lowest levels play significant\nrole in this case. In this paper, we examine the effect of an inhomogeneous magnetic field which varies\nas B = (0, 0, 1/x) on the lowest energy level and show that it exhibits zero energy solutions which\nis different from those obtained for the case of the constant magnetic field discussed above. As it\nis well-known, this magnetic field occurs around a straight long current-carrying wire (see Fig. 1).\nWe first, in the next section briefly discuss the supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the shape\ninvariant method [11-14] which turns out to be useful for our investigation.\n\n2\n\nSupersymmetric quantum mechanics\n\nOne of the methods for solving the quantum mechanical problems is based on finding the relation\nbetween ground state wave function and the corresponding potential. Considering the Hamiltonian\nH(x) as:\nd2\nH(x) = \u2212 2 + V (x),\n(28)\ndx\nwith associated eigenfunctions and eigenvalues \u03c8n (x) and En , respectively, we can write:\nH(x)\u03c8n (x) = En \u03c8n (x)\n\n(29)\n\nH1 (x)\u03c8n (x) = H(x) \u2212 E0 ,\n\n(30)\n\nNow, if one defines H1 (x) as:\n\n5\n\n\fso that its ground state energy become zero (E0 is the ground state energy of H(x)), we can write:\nH1 (x) = \u2212\n\nd2\nd2\n+\nV\n(x)\n=\n\u2212\n+ V (x) \u2212 E0 ,\n1\ndx2\ndx2\n\n(31)\n\nIt is clear that the two Hamiltonians H(x) and H1 (x) have the same eigenfunctions. Denoting the\neigenfunctions and eigenvalues of H1 (x) with \u03c8n1 (x) and En1 , respectively, we can write:\nH1 (x)\u03c8n (x) = (En \u2212 E0 )\u03c8n (x) \u2192 \u03c8n (x) = \u03c8n1 (x),\n\nEn1 = En \u2212 E0\n\n(32)\n\nNow with defining the ladder operators \u00c2 and \u00c2\u2020 as:\n\u00c2 =\n\nd\n+ W (x),\ndx\n\n\u00c2\u2020 = \u2212\n\nd\n+ W (x),\ndx\n\n(33)\n\nwhere W (x) is called superpotential, one can write H1 (x) in terms of the above operators as:\nH1 (x) = \u00c2\u2020 \u00c2 = \u2212\n\nd2\n+ V1 (x),\ndx2\n\n(34)\n\nHere we see that from the relations (31) and (33) one can arrive at the following relation for V1 (x):\nV1 (x) = W 2 (x) \u2212\n\ndW (x)\ndx\n\n(35)\n\nand keeping in mind that the ground state energy of H1 (x) is zero, we arrive at:\nH1 (x)\u03c801 (x) = \u00c2\u2020 \u00c2\u03c801 (x) = 0,\n\n(36)\n\nwhich means that \u00c2 annihilates the ground state wave function \u03c801 (x), i.e.:\n\u00c2\u03c801 (x) = 0\n\n(37)\n\nNow it is obvious that from equations 34-36 one can write the ground state wave function with respect\nto the superpotential W (x) and vise versa:\n\u03c80 (x) = N e\u2212\n\nRx\n\nW (x)dx\n\n\u2194 W (x) = \u2212\n\nd\n1 d\u03c80 (x)\nln \u03c80 (x) = \u2212\ndx\n\u03c80 (x) dx\n\n(38)\n\nIt is by now that we can define Hamiltonian H2 (x), partner of H1 (x), which we denote them with\nH+ (x) and H\u2212 (x) from now on, respectively, as follows:\nH+ (x) = \u00c2\u00c2\u2020 = \u2212\nwith\n\nd2\n+ V+ (x),\ndx2\n\n(39)\n\ndW (x, a0 )\n(40)\ndx\nare supposed to be shape invariant if they satisfy\n\nV+ (x) = W 2 (x, a0 ) +\n\nThe supersymmetric partner potential V\u2212 and V+\nthe following equation:\nV+ (x, a0 ) = V\u2212 (x, a1 ) + R(a0 ),\n6\n\n(41)\n\n\fwhich means that two supersymmetric partner potentials have the same form, but are characterized\nby the different values of parameters a0 and a1 . To be more specific, the parameter a1 is a function of\na0 , namely, a1 = R(a0 ) with R an independent function of x. Now one can obtain the energy spectrum\nassociated to V\u2212 (x, a0 ) simply from the shape invariance condition as:\nEn\u2212 (a0 )\n\n=\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nR(ai ),\n\n(42)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere for n > 0:\nE0\u2212 (a0 ) = 0\n\n(43)\n\nwhile the corresponding wave functions are given by:\n\u03c8n\u2212 (x, a0 ) \u223c \u00c2\u2020 (x, a0 )\u00c2\u2020 (x, a1 )...\u00c2\u2020 (x, a0 )(x, a1 )\u03c80\u2212 (x, an )\n\u2212\n(x, a1 ).\n= \u00c2\u2020 (x, a0 )\u03c8n\u22121\n\n(44)\n\nNote that there are only a few problems that satisfy the shape invariant condition (41). As we show\nin the next section, although the ground state energy level can be obtained analytically, the shape\ninvariant condition is not satisfied.\n\n3\n\nZero energy modes corresponding to effect of a varying magnetic\nfield\n\nAs we'll show in what follows, graphene spectrum under the influence of a magnetic field which varies\nas inverse of distance, i.e. B = (0, 0, 1/x) exhibits zero energy modes. This magnetic field occurs\noften, as it is the magnetic filed around a long, straight current-carrying wire. In fact because of the\nsymmetry of the wire the magnetic lines are circles concentric with it and lie in the planes perpendicular\nto the wire. The magnetic field B is constant on any circle of radius R and is given by:\nB=\n\n\u03bc0 I\n2\u03c0R\n\n(45)\n\nwhere I is the current of the wire and \u03bc0 is the magnetic constant. Now if we consider a graphene\nsheet which lies parallel to the axis of wire so that the lines of the magnetic field intersect the graphene\nsheet which is assumed to be in xy-plane, the corresponding vector potential can be written as:\n1\nA = (0, q ln x, 0), \u2192 B = (0, 0, q ),\nx\n\n(46)\n\nwhere we have used the Landau gauge and defined q to be:\nq=\n\n\u03bc0 I\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(47)\n\nAt this point, if we go through the same procedure as the case of the constant magnetic field (see\nsection 1), in this case, we'll obtain for the S and D (with taking vF = 1 in our evaluations):\nS = \u2212\u2202x + i(\u2202y \u2212 iqe ln x),\nD = \u2202x + i(\u2202y \u2212 iqe ln x).\n7\n\n(48)\n\n\fIn the next step by taking the units such that h\u0304 = c = 1, we can make the following ansatz:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6\n\u03a8(r, t) =\neiEt ,\n\u03c8\nwhich leads us to the following equation:\nn\nqe o\nE 2 \u03c8(r) = \u2212\u22072 + q 2 e2 ln2 x + 2iqe ln x\u2202y +\n\u03c8(r).\nx\n\n(49)\n\n(50)\n\nWe then make the following ansatz for \u03c8(r) as:\n\u03c8(r) = eiky y f (x),\nwhich plugging it into (50) gives:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd2\nqe\n2\n2 2 2\nf (x) = E 2 f (x)\n\u2212 2 + ky + q e ln x \u2212 2qeky ln x +\ndx\nx\n\n(51)\n\n(52)\n\nThe above equation is an eigenvalue equation that can be written as:\n\u000f = E2\n\nH(x)f (x) = \u000ff (x),\n\n(53)\n\nIt is by now that we can write the superpotential W (x) in the form:\nb\nW (x) = \u2212a ln x + .\na\n\n(54)\n\nThen we define Hamiltonian H1 (x) as:\nH1 (x) = \u2212\n\nd2\nd2\n+\nV\n(x)\n=\n\u2212\n+ V (x) \u2212 \u000f0 ,\n1\ndx2\ndx2\n\n(55)\n\nwhere \u000f0 is the ground state energy of H(x) and V1 (x) by the use of the relation:\nV1 (x) = W 2 (x) \u2212\n\ndW (x)\n,\ndx\n\n(56)\n\nis given by:\na\nb2\n+ 2.\nx a\nNow by comparing the two Hamiltonians H(x) and H1 (x), one can get a and b as:\nV1 (x) = a2 ln2 x \u2212 2b ln x +\n\na = qe,\n\nb = qeky ,\n\n(57)\n\n(58)\n\nwhich reveals that they are just the same and, therefore, we obtain:\n\u000f0 = 0,\n\n(59)\n\nmeaning that the ground state energy level, E0 , is zero. Here we should note that the other energy\nlevels can not be derived analytically because the shape invariant condition (41) is not satisfied. We\nalso note that for \u03c6(r) the same result is obtained, since we the commutation relation:\n[S, D] = 0,\n8\n\n(60)\n\n\fis satisfied, meaning that the x and y components of dynamical momentum do not commute with each\nother. Thus, we have arrived at a very important result. For graphene under a varying magnetic field\ndiscussed above, there exists two zero energy modes for which the probability for Dirac fermions to be\non the sublattice A is the same as sublattice B. However this does not mean that these zero energy\nare different to those obtained for uniform magnetic field in the sense of living electrons on the two\nsublattices. It is because, as we pointed out in the first section, the wave function for the other Dirac\npoint are swapped for a constant magnetic field and therefore in an uniform magnetic field electrons\nare present on both triangular sublattices as well as the electrons in a varying magnetic field. The\nwhole argue is about the single valley Hamiltonian which One can also obtained f0 (x) as follows:\nf0 (x) = N exp(eqx ln x \u2212 eqx \u2212 ky x)\n\n(61)\n\nwhere N is the normalization constant and subscribe 0 shows that f0 (x) is the wave function associated to the lowest energy level. Note that, here x takes its positive values (x > 0). It may be\nassumed that the existence of the two Dirac points has completely fixed the zero of the energy at\nthese points, however, interestingly, for a magnetic field which varies inversely as square of distance,\ni.e. B=(0, 0, \u03bb/x2 ) (where \u03bb is a constant), the energy spectrum can be obtained analytically using\nthe shape invariant method as [15]:\ns\n\u03bb2 e2 ky2\np\nEn = \u00b1vF ky2 \u2212\n,\n(62)\n(n + 1/2 + 1/4 + \u03bbe(\u03bbe \u2212 1))2\nwhich shows that for ky 6= 0, the n = 0 energy level (E0 ) is not zero, unlike the ground state energy due\nto the effect of the magnetic field from a long current-carrying wire which revealed (even for nonzero\nvalues for ky ) to be zero.\n\n4\n\nImplications for experiment\n\nNo zero energy modes are observed when a magnetic field is applied to a system consistent of electrons\nconfined in a conventional two dimensional structure, since charge carriers in conventional 2D systems\nobey the schr\u00f6dinger equation of motion and therefore no massless carriers are imagined for them.\nHowever, it does not mean that strong magnetic field can not be applied to these systems which give\nrise to the observation of conventional quantum Hall effect. The problem is about the magnetic field\ndiscussed in the previous section. In fact, one arrives at no analytical solution when the effect of the\nmagnetic field B = (0, 0, q/x) (see Eq. (46)) is examined on the massive carries no mater whether they\nbehave relativistically or not. This may be the reason why no investigations has been reported up to\nnow concerning the effect that this kind of magnetic field might have on conventional 2D system.\nFrom the above discution we see that graphene could be considered as the only 2D structure that\ninvestigation regarding the effect of the magnetic field (46) - both from the theoretical and experimental\npoint of view - is worth noting. As it is shown in Fig.1, the magnetic lines lie in the planes perpendicular\nto the wire and intersect the graphene's plane. The magnetic field B which is constant on any circle\nof radius R, decrease inversely as the distance increases in the x-direction.\nHere, there is no need to say that the result reported in this paper regarding the existence of zero\nenergy modes could be put to the test in contrast with other types of nonuniform magnetic fields such\nas that varies inversely as square of the distance x (see equation 62) and those investigated in [16].\n9\n\n\f0.12\n\nspacial density ditribution\n\n0.1\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0\n-100\n\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nx nm\n\nFigure 1: Left: The lines of the magnetic field from a current carrying wire which in the xy-plane\ndecreases as 1/x, lie in the planes perpendicular to the wire and intersect the graphene's sheet. Right:\nThe density distribution associated with the f0 (x) for currents I1 (green line) and I2 (red line) for\nwhich I2 = 2I2 . As it is expected the width of the wave-packet grows as the current I -and therefore\nthe magnetic field- decreases.\n\n10\n\n\fIn the end of this section, we should note that the magnetic field created by a toroid for a special case\nvaries inversely as distance as well. However, it is often used to create an almost uniform magnetic\nfield in some enclosed area. One can use Amperes law to obtain the magnetic field inside of a toroid\nwith N turns of wire as:\n\u03bcN I\nB=\n(63)\n2\u03c0r\nwhere r which is measured from the center of the toroid is the radius of a circle to which the direction\nof the magnetic field is tangent. In fact the magnetic filed is approximately uniform inside the torus,\nif the radius of toroid, r, is very large compared with the cross-sectional radius of it. But for small\nvalues of r the magnetic field falls off inversely as r. So our results can also hold for this case as well.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this work, we examined the effect of a magnetic field varying inversely as distance on the ground\nstate energy level of graphene. One important reason for studying this type of magnetic field- apart\nfrom this fact that it occurs often-is that it is . In fact it is the magnetic field of a long carryingcurrent wire and, therefore, it can be important when it comes to applications of carbon nanotubes\nand nanowires with graphene. We also showed that graphene under the influence of such a magnetic\nfield exhibits zero energy modes which is kind of different from the zero energy modes corresponding to\nthe uniform magnetic filed (counted for the observation of the unconventional quantum Hall effect in\ngraphene). In fact, contrary to the former case, the zero energy solutions associated to the magnetic\nfield B = (0, 0, q x1 ) do not show the localization of Dirac fermions on just one sublattice but they\nimply that the probability to find electrons on one sublattice, say A, is the same as other one, say B.\nWe also discussed the original interpretation of observation of the half-integer quantum Hall effect in\ngraphene which does not seem to be complectly satisfactory because the localization of electrons on\none sublattice does not imply that the density of states due to the n = 0 Landau level is half of the\nothers. We also discussed about how the effect of the two kind of magnetic field which varied as 1/x2\nand 1/x on the graphene spectrum could lead to the different results.\nIn this work we investigated the effect of a the latter case on the massless Dirac fermions of undoped\ngraphene, leading to observation of two zero energy modes which, as we said, are different in the sense\nof living the electrons on the different sublattices (per valley/spin). As we pointed out, considering\nthe massive relativistic particles no analytical solution for the lowest energy level is obtained and it\nmight be the reason that the potential (45) have not been considered up to now.\nIn the end, we should note that at the first sight it might seem strange that the localization of charge\ncarriers differs for the varying and constant magnetic field. However, by considering the two Dirac\npoints we see that one indicates the localization of electrons on B and another on the A sublattice\nand therefore the equivalency of carbon atoms is not broken.\nAnother point which is worth noting here is that the magnetic energy levels obtained from the tightbinding model agrees well with that calculated from the kp model [17].\n\nReferences\n[1] K.S.
