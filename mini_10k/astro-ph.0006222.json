Fortunately, the technological advances that are giving rise to the increasing background of radiation \u2013 through increased\ntelecommunications and wide-spread use of high\nspeed electronics \u2013 are also providing some of the\ntools necessary for separating astronomical signals from undesirable RFI contamination. New\nradio telescopes will necessarily have RFI suppres-\n\n1\n\n\fthe instrument reception pattern in the directions of sources of RFI (Hampson et al. 1998;\nEllingson & Hampson 2000; Leshem et al. 2000;\nSmolders & Hampson 2000; Kewley et al. 2000),\n(2) parametric signal modeling techniques, where\nthe RFI signal is received and decoded to obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reference\nsignal for subtraction from the astronomical data\n(Ellingson et al. 2000; Leshem & van der Veen 1999a;\nLeshem & van der Veen 1999b), and (3) adaptive filtering using a reference horn to obtain a\nhigh SNR copy of the RFI for real-time cancellation from the signal path ahead of the\nstandard radio astronomical backend processors\n(Barnbaum & Bradley 1998).\nThis paper describes an intuitive but powerful RFI cancellation technique that is suitable\nfor radio spectroscopy where time-averages are\nrecorded. The method requires computation of\ncross power spectra between the RFI contaminated astronomical signals and high signal-tonoise ratio RFI \"reference signals\" obtained from\na receiving system that senses the RFI but not\nthe astronomical signal. The correction term that\nremoves the unwanted RFI is computed from closure relations obeyed by the RFI signal. The test\napplications reported here derived the reference\nsignal either from a separate horn antenna aimed\nat the RFI source or from a second feed horn at\nthe focus of the Parkes telescope, as illustrated in\nFig 1. For these experiments, we recorded digitally\nsampled baseband signals from two polarizations\nfor both the reference and astronomy feeds, and\nthen we performed the cross correlations in software off-line. However, the method could use correlation spectrometers of the sort already in use at\nradio observatories. With minor design enhancements, future generation correlators could incorporate this technique with the additional benefit\nof the faster electronics, greater digital precision,\nand higher data rates that technological advance\npromises.\nThere are a number of advantages to performing the RFI in a \"post-correlation\" stage. Foremost is that the RFI subtraction remains an option in the data reduction path, rather than a commitment made online and permanently. Furthermore, the correlation method is effectively a coherent subtraction, since the correlation functions\nretain the information describing relative phase\n2\n\nFig. 1.- Three configurations applicable to the\nanalysis in this paper. Top The four basebands\nare recorded from the 2 polarizations of the Parkes\ntelescope feed and 2 polarizations of a reference\nhorn directed at the RFI source. Center The\nfour basebands correspond to 2 polarizations from\neach of two Parkes feeds. Bottom A proposed system for optimal application of the RFI subtraction\ntechnique described here.\n\n\fbetween the RFI entering in the astronomy data\nstream and the RFI entering the reference antenna. As we show in this paper, this means that\nthe RFI noise power is largely subtracted, leaving\nonly the usual components of system noise.\nThis paper provides a description of the postcorrelation RFI cancellation technique and illustrates its success with data from the Parkes telescope. A mathematical overview shows (1) why\nunknown multipaths do not cause the algorithm to\nbreak down, (2) how to simply construct a suitable\nRFI reference spectrum, and (3) how to build an\ninverse filter to obtain immunity to low signal levels at frequencies that suffer destructive interference by multipathing in the reference horn signal\npath.\n2.\n\nHere HA (t) and H1 (t) are impulse responses for\nthe astronomy signal path and interference respectively, and \u22c6 is the convolution operator.\nFor many purposes, an intuitive picture of the\nmultipathing results from considering the scattering sites to be achromatic mirror-like scatterers\neach with relative effective areas GA,j and G1,k ,\nand attaching the path delay to each separate version\nand RFI signals, s1 (t) =\nP of the astronomy P\nG\na\n(t\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n)\n+\n1,j\nk G1,k i(t \u2212 \u03c41,k ) + n1 (t).\nj A,j A\nThe time delays \u03c4 are determined by the different\npath lengths L1,j to give \u03c41,j = L1,j /c, where c is\nthe speed of light.\nAll the signal paths are vulnerable to corruption by stochastic noise. The noise terms n1 (t),\nn2 (t), n3 (t), and n4 (t) should ideally be uncorrelated among the different data paths. Unfortunately, in real astronomical systems, there is likely\nto be low level coupling between the two orthogonal polarizations of a feed horn or common stray\nradiation pickup from spillover that will make a\nweakly correlated noise floor in some of the cross\npower spectra. This will form a systematic limitation to the accuracy of the subtraction.\nIn this experiment, the goal is to explore the\nusefulness of cross-correlation spectra to correct\nfor the effects of RFI in time-averaged spectra.\nThese spectra are products of scaled sums of the\nof the Fourier transforms of the astronomy signals,\nthe RFI and noise. In the tests with real data in\nsection 4, we compute estimates of the complex\nspectra\n\nMathematical description of the method\n\nIn our mathematical model, we make the assumption that the RFI source emits a single signal\ni(t). (At the RFI source, the signal from a single power amplifier feeds an antenna of unknown,\nbut irrelevant, polarization.) The RFI that appears differently in the recorded data channels at\nParkes has experienced scatterings with different\npath lengths and amplitudes, so that the received\nsignals are linear sums of time delayed versions of\nthe original broadcast i(t).\nIn fact, the model is applicable to multiple interferers within the spectrometer band, provided\nthey do not overlap in frequency.\nConsider for the moment a single interferer,\nwhich propagates through the four signal paths s1 ,\ns2 , s3 , and s4 that will be processed: there are two\nastronomical channels, s1 (t) and s2 (t), which convey the voltages aA (t) and aB (t) from the celestial\nsources for the two independent polarizations from\nthe Parkes Telescope receiver along with contamination from the RFI signal i(t). Radiation from\nastronomical sources may be partially polarized,\ncausing aA (t) and aB (t) to be correlated to some\ndegree. The two reference channels carry s3 (t) and\ns4 (t), containing the representations of i(t) but\nnegligible signal from the celestial sources. For example, the measured signal in channel 1 comprises\nchannel noise n1 (t), plus the convolutions of the\nimpulse responses for the multiple scattering paths\nfor the interference signal and the true astronomy\nsignal: s1 (t) = HA (t)\u22c6aA (t)+H1 (t)\u22c6i(t)+n1 (t).\n\nS1 (f ) =\n\ngA AA + g1 I + N1\n\nS2 (f ) =\nS3 (f ) =\n\ngB AB + g2 I + N2\ng 3 I + N3\n\nS4 (f ) =\n\ng 4 I + N4\n\n(1)\n\nfrom Fourier transforms of finite length time series of discrete samples of the four signals. The\ntransforms contain contributions from the celestial sources AA (f ) and AB (f ), the RFI I(f ), and\nthe noise in each channel Ni (f ), modulated by the\nassociated complex voltage gains, which are the\nFourier transforms of the impulse responses H(t).\nThe gains for each channel separate into dependencies on (1) the path delay L/c, which appears\nin a frequency dependent phase term, according to\nthe Shift Theorem of Fourier transforms, and (2)\na possible additional frequency dependence g(f )\n3\n\n\fof each delay path:\nX\ng1 (f ) =\ng1,k (f )ei2\u03c0f L1,k /c\n\nthe RFI signal to the telescope feed will change,\nresulting in loss of precision in the cancellation\nscheme and and leading to substantial residuals in\nthe corrected spectra.\nThe complex cross power spectra for all combinations of the four data channels have the following form when the leading contributions are\nretained:\n\n(2)\n\nThese complex gain and delay factors are sufficiently general to include complicated scatterers\nand propagation through dispersive and lossy media.\nThe real power spectra for the four data channels have the following form, once terms that average toward zero are omitted and the complex gains\nare assumed to be constant over the time span for\nwhich the spectra are computed:\nP1 (f ) =\n=\nP2 (f ) =\n=\n\n< S1 S1\u2217\n|gA |2 <\n\nC12 (f ) = < S1 S2\u2217 >\n\u2217\n= gA gB\n< AA A\u2217B >\n+ g1 g2\u2217 < |I|2 >\n\n+ g1 < IN2\u2217 > +g2\u2217 < N1 I \u2217 >\n+ < N1 N2\u2217 >\n\n>\n|AA |2 >\n\nCij (f ) = < Si Sj\u2217 >\n\n+ |g1 |2 < |I|2 > + < |N1 |2 >\n\n=\n\n< S2 S2\u2217 >\n|gB |2 < |AB |2 >\n\nP3 (f ) =\n\n+ |g2 |2 < |I|2 > + < |N2 |2 >\n< S3 S3\u2217 >\n\n=\nP4 (f ) =\n\n|g3 |2 < |I|2 > + < |N3 |2 >\n< S4 S4\u2217 >\n\n=\n\n|g4 |2 < |I|2 > + < |N4 |2 >\n\n+ gi < INj\u2217 > +gj\u2217 < Ni I \u2217 >\n+ < Ni Nj\u2217 >\nfor i 6= j, j > 2\n\n(5)\n\nIn order to cancel the dominant RFI terms in\nthe power spectra Eqns 3, we need to compute\nquantities of the form |g1 |2 < |I|2 >, which can\nbe subtracted from the measured < |S1 |2 >.

Whenever \u03c8(f ) becomes small compared to C34 (f ), the expressions\nEqns 10-12 revert to Eqns 7-9. When the noise exceeds the signal power in C34 , the computed correction tends to zero. In practice, during the test\ndescribed here, a constant \u03c80 was used in place\nof \u03c8(f ).

For use\nin correction schemes, the cross power spectrum\nC34 (f ) has the advantage that it is not contaminated by the positive bias of the receiver noise\ntotal power that is seen in the autocorrelation\npower spectra. In practice, the low level correlated signal in C34 (f ), due to actual cross correlated broadband power or due to correlated quantization noise, may limit the accuracy of the cross\npower spectrum as an estimate of the RFI.\nFig 7 compares uncorrected and corrected spectra for two scans. For the purposes of display,\nthe spectra have been crudely passband calibrated\nby dividing the spectra by gain templates formed\nfrom the scan average of the total power spectra\nof scan SRT00601, which was recorded while the\nsky frequency for the Parkes data channels was\ntuned off the RFI frequency. Since this gain template is in common to the processing for both scans\nSRT00501 and SRT00502, some of the common\nstructure in the spectra in Fig 7 results from this\ncommon gain template.\n\nThe time dependence of the RFI sensed by the\nParkes telescope is displayed in image format in\nFig 8, side by side with the spectra after the RFI\nsubtraction. These spectra received the same processing as described for the averages in Fig 7, with\nthe additional step of subtracting a third order\npolynomial spectral baseline from each time step.\nThis additional step was done to remove some\nfaint variations in the total power level that occurred from one integration to the next.\nThe cross polarized spectrum from the Parkes\nA\u00d7B is shown in Fig 9. The figure includes the\nraw spectrum and the corrected spectrum after\nsubtraction of the correction shown in Fig 5. Remaining in the corrected spectrum, there is a slow\nmodulation of the power across the 5 MHz band,\nprobably indicating that this power represents\nbroad band noise signal that is scattered within\nthe Parkes telescope structure with the same delay\npath lengths associated with traditional standing\nwaves and path lengths of a few hundred feet.\nThe integration time over which the RFI corrections are applied is a critical parameter when\nthe signal to noise ratio of the reference signal data\n\n9\n\n\fFig. 9.- Raw and Corrected Parkes A\u00d7B cross\npower spectra.

A third order polynomial spectral\nbaseline was fitted to channels 30-235, 370-405 and\n420-500 and subtracted for each time step.\n\nFig. 10.- The effect of varying the time interval on which algorithm described in Eqns 10-12 is\napplied. The interval varies from 8 msec to 8 sec\nin factors of 10. In each panel, the upper spectrum shows the corrected, calibrated, baselined\nspectrum; the lower spectrum is the RMS scatter about the mean spectrum for each channel as\na function of time.\u221a The typical value for RMS\nshould decrease by 10 for each increase in factor\n10 in integration time.\n\n10\n\n\fpath is low. If the integration time is too short,\nthen some of the derived correction will be noise,\nand this will be folded into the resulting spectrum.\nOn the other hand, if the integration time is long,\nthe impulse response functions that couple the astronomy and RFI signals to the receiver will vary,\nand the mathematics in Eqn 4 and Eqns 7-9 will\nbreak down. Fig 10 shows a series of tests with\na range of integration times (tint \u223c 8 msec to 8\nsec) for application of the RFI subtraction. In all\ncases, the plots give the grand averages of the entire 25 seconds of the scan after application of the\nalgorithm on the shorter data segments. The parameter \u03c8o has an appropriate value in each case\nto produce a stable noise level and representation\nof spectral features in the frequency range away\nfrom the RFI contamination. For these data, the\nalgorithm was most effective for integration times\nof only a \u223c 1 sec or less. When treated on 8 sec\naverages, substantial RFI remains unsubtracted.\n5.\n\nthe distance, can be scattered into the Parkes Telescope signal paths without being sensed by the\nreference horn.\nThe coarse digitization of the RFI reference signals will eventually form a limitation to the precision of the subtraction. Crude quantization generates an artificial noise floor throughout the spectrum, effectively scattering power out of the narrow band RFI. Since both polarizations from the\nreference horn are recorded at relatively high signal to noise ratio, the quantization noise is also\ncorrelated between the two data channels, so that\nthere is corruption of the cross power spectrum as\nwell as for the autocorrelation spectra. (The implication is that the term < N3 N4 > in Eqn 5 will\nnot average to zero with increased integration.)\n6.\n\nThe Toxicity Test\n\nA crucial requirement of an RFI subtraction\nalgorithm is that it must leave the astronomical\nsignal of interest unaltered. To test the current\nmethod, we added simulated galaxy signals to the\ntwo Parkes input data streams. Independent gaussian noise was filtered with a double-horned galaxy\nprofile and the instrumental IF filter passbands\nand then injected into the data pipeline just before\nthe correlation stage. Fig 11 shows a comparison\nbetween the RFI corrected spectra both with and\nwithout the galaxy. To highlight the difference between the injected signal and the output after RFI\nsubtraction, the bottom panel shows (1) the difference between the output with and without the\nadded signal and (2) the ratio of this difference\nto the synthetic galaxy profile added to the input. The RMS deviation of the ratio about unity\nis 0.005 for polarization A and 0.006 for polarization B. No systematic deviations are seen across\nthe band, other than rises in noise level at the\nedges where the galaxy profile is approaching zero\nat the edge of the profile. The conclusion is that\nthis method does no systematic harm to the astronomical signals.\n\nDiscussion of Limitations\n\nThe wide range of delays for the scattered\nRFI led to problems in our initial experiments,\nwhich simulated an FX correlator with 2048 sample transforms. The RFI illustrated in Fig 4 has\ntwo strong components that are delayed by 15 and\n60 time steps. A 60 time step delay is \u223c3% of\nthe time block being processed, so that the cross\ncorrelation is not being performed on fully overlapped data streams. Increasing the window to\n8192 was adequate to reduce the residuals to a\nlevel that was barely visible above the noise in\nthe corrected spectra. An additional but less significant improvement resulted from applying an\nconstant delay offset of 35 time steps to the reference signal at the input to the \"FX correlator\" to\nmake it closer to the average of the principal delays\nin the Parkes data channels. A traditional timedomain lag correlation spectrometer would not encounter this problem, provided a sufficient number\nof lags are allocated to fully cover the range of delays experienced by the RFI.\nIn these tests at Parkes, there is a possibility\nthat some uncancelled signal may be present due\nto a second transmitter operating at these same\nfrequencies. The reference horn was pointed at\nthe stronger, nearby transmitter, while the second\ntransmitter, located at approximately three times\n\n7.\n\nThe Parkes Two Feed Experiment\n\nThe mathematical description (Eqns. 3 to 12)\ncan be equally well applied to a case that uses\na second feed from the Parkes Telescope as the\n\"reference horn.\" Both feeds may receive astronomical signals, but since the feeds point different\n11\n\n\fdirections in the sky, these are independent astronomical signals, which will not correlate and\ntherefore will not be subtracted from each other\nby this algorithm. The two feeds do sense the\nsame RFI signal i(t), although through different\nscattering paths. This is sufficient commonality\nthat the cross power spectral approach should permit each feed to serve as the reference antenna for\nthe other. Similar experiments have been reported\n(Sault 1997; Kewley et al. 1999).\n\nFig. 12.- The autocorrelation spectra for both\npolarizations of two feeds of the Parkes Multibeam System before and after rfi subtraction. An\nattempt was made to apply a passband calibration using the same passbands determined from\nthe scan SRT006 01 for the reference horn experiment. The data were treated in \u223c82 msec averages, which in turn were integrated over the 20\nsecond duration of the scan.\n\nFig. 11.- Survival of an injected synthetic galaxy\nsignal in the astronomy channels through the RFI\nsubtraction process.

There is noticeable difference among the\nfour channels in the effectiveness of the RFI subtraction. This probably results from hte bias\nbreated by the broadband polarized flux or correlated noise in the cross polarized spectra 3\u00d74\nthat is being used as the \"reference\" for data channels 1 and 2. As shown in Fig. 13, this noise\nfloor is higher in feed 2 (IN R \u223c 35:1) than in\n12\n\n\ffeed 1 (IN R \u223c 100:1), causing the rfi template\nspectra derived from the cross power spectra to be\nless faithful, which in turn leads to larger error in\nthe correction spectra to be subtracted from feed\n1. For comparison, the reference horn spectrum\nC34 (f ) in Fig 4 has IN R \u223c 1000:1\n8.\n\nConclusions\n\nRFI subtraction can be performed using cross\npower spectra between the astronomy data channels and RFI \"reference\" channels. In principle,\nthe reference channel can also be an astronomy\nchannel provide it carries an astronomy signal that\nis uncorrelated with the astronomy in the channel\nthat is being corrected.\nThe tests made at Parkes demonstrate that a\nspecifically designed reference sensor provided a\nhigher signal-to-noise ratio reference signal \u2013 and\nconsequently cleaner cancellation \u2013 than that obtained from a second horn feed at the Parkes Telescope focus, whose principal function is to illuminate the Parkes dish.\nA refinement will be to implement this scheme\nusing two reference antennas that are spatially\nseparated (as in the lower diagram of Fig 1) in order to avoid correlated noise contributions, while\nstill obtaining as clear and stable path to the RFI\nsource as possible. The cross power spectra from\nthe two spatially separated antennas would form\nan optimal RFI reference spectrum C34 for use in\nthe Eqns 10-12. To avoid problems with differential delay causing loss of coherence in the reference\nsignal, the spectrometer would need to operate\nwith spectral resolution \u2206f = (\u2206\u03c6/2\u03c0)c/L <<\nc/L where \u2206\u03c6 is the allowable phase rotation\nacross a spectrometer channel and L is the spatial\nseparation of the sensors. The 2.4 kHz spectrometer resolution emulated in software for the study\nreported here would allow spatial separations of\nup to 1200m, if \u2206\u03c6 is required to be less than\n0.02\u03c0 radians.\nThere are a number of advantages to performing this type of \"post-correlation\" RFI subtraction:\n1. Provided the required correlation products are\nrecorded (i.e. the online system is capable of\nrecording correlation functions with a sufficiently\nlarge number of delay lags), the RFI subtraction\ncan be performed offline, where it remains an op-\n\nFig. 13.- The cross polarization spectra for two\nfeeds of the Parkes Multibeam System before and\nafter rfi subtraction for scan SRT00108. An attempt was made to apply a passband calibration using the same passbands determined from\nthe scan SRT006 01 for the reference horn experiment. The data were treated in \u223c82 msec averages, which in turn were integrated over the 20\nsecond duration of the scan. Dotted lines show\nthe spectra amplified by a factor 10.\n\n13\n\n\ftion in the data reduction path, rather than a commitment made online and permanently.\n2. The method is not vulnerable to the effects\nof sporadic RFI, which hurt many algorithms that\nhave an initialization period while they acquire the\nRFI signal and optimize their cancellation parameters.\n3. Nor is the result influenced by changes in beam\nshape during adaptive nulling.\n4. The correlation method is effectively a coherent\nsubtraction, since the correlation functions retain\nthe information describing relative phase between\nthe RFI entering in the astronomy data stream\nand the RFI entering the reference antenna. We\nshowed in section 3, this means that the RFI noise\npower is largely subtracted, leaving only system\nnoise.\n5. Generalization of the method to an array\nof telescopes is straightforward but demands additional correlator capacity. If there are two\nreference signal sensors, labeled \"x\" and \"y,\"\nthat sense negligible astronomical signal, then\ntheir cross power spectrum Cxy (f ) containing a\nhigh INR signal can be used to correct any other\npower spectrum Cij (f ) through the closure rela\u2217\n\u2217\n/Cxy\n. The i, j indices can denote ortion Cix Cjy\nthogonal or parallel polarizations drawn from any\ncombinations of antennas in the array or auto correlation, when i = j.\n6. A modification of the method can be applied\nto pulsar data streams in which a digital correlator replaces the narrow band filter bank used\nin compensating for pulse dispersion. One possible implementation would construct cross-power\n\"coupling spectra\" X(f ) that are valid for the time\ninterval tint during which the \"g factors\" of Eqn 1\nare stable. The coupling spectrum is\n\nsubtracting the correction\n\u2217\n\u2217\nSX1 = g1 I = X13\ng3 I \u2248 X13\nS3\n\nfrom S1 (f ) and inverse Fourier transforming to obtain an RFI cancelled version of s1 (t). Computationally efficient schemes could be implemented\nthat include coherent dedispersion (Hankins 1974)\nin the same transform operations as the RFI cancellation.\n7. The method can be generalized to removal of\nsolar radiation whose multi-path scattering effects\ngive rise to the spectral \"standing wave\" problem. The important difference that the Sun generates a dual polarized signal with a variable polarized component; this will necessitate a processing\npath more akin to the sub-space decomposition\n(Ellingson 1999; Leshem et al. 2000), in order to\nidentify orthogonal components of the solar \"rfi\"\nsignals.\n8. The present generation of digital correlators,\nwhich typically operate with single bit to 9 level\nprecision, could implement this method for use in\nmoderate levels of RFI for testing and astronomical observation in the near future.\nThe disadvantages of the method are: (1) The\ndata rates will be high, since the method requires\na full-scale cross correlator, preferably with multibit precision to accept large SNR RFI reference\nsignals, that must dump spectra after relatively\nshort integrations of less than \u223c1 sec. Of course,\nthese data rates are lower than recording the full\nbaseband, but they are substantially higher than\na real-time adaptive filter approach, which would\nallow long spectral integrations once the RFI has\nbeen canceled. (2) When the interference is much\nstronger than the astronomical signal, a 1 or 2\nbit sampler is \"captured\" so that the data stream\nconsists primarily of \u00b12, and the zero crossings\n\u2217\nare determined by the phase of the interferer.
