The dark matter self-interaction would\nproduce isothermal cores in halos and expel the dark matter particles from dwarfs\norbiting in large halos. Another consequence of the model is that halos should\nbecome spherical once most particles have interacted. Several observations show\nthat the mass distribution in relaxed clusters of galaxies is elliptical. Here, I\ndiscuss in particular gravitational lensing in the cluster MS2137-23, where the\nellipticity of the dark matter distribution can be measured to a small radius,\nr \u223c 70 kpc, suggesting that most dark matter particles in clusters outside this\nradius do not collide during the characteristic age of clusters. If true, this implies\nthat any dark matter self-interaction with a cross section independent of velocity\nis too weak to have affected the observed density profiles in the dark-matter\ndominated dwarf galaxies, or to have facilitated the destruction of dwarf satellites\nin galactic halos.

Whereas the observations show linearly rising\nrotation curves out to core radii greater than 1 kpc in certain dwarf galaxies where the density\nis dominated by dark matter everywhere (indicating that the dark matter has a constant\ndensity core), the simulations predict that the collapse of collisionless particles of cold dark\nmatter produces cuspy halo density profiles, with a logarithmic slope \u2212d log \u03c1/d log r > 1\ndown to the smallest resolved radius. A second problem is that the number of dwarf galaxies\nobserved in the Local Group is much smaller than the total number predicted from numerical\nsimulations ((Klypin et al. 1999); (Moore et al. 1999b)).\nA solution to this discrepancy has been proposed by Spergel & Steinhardt (2000): if\nthe dark matter is self-interacting, with large enough cross section to make most particles\nin the inner core of a dwarf galaxy interact among themselves over a Hubble time, then an\nisothermal core will be produced. A clear prediction of this hypothesis is that when most\nof the particles of a halo within some radius rc have interacted, then the halo should be\nclose to spherical inside rc , or else be supported by rotation, because the velocity dispersion\ntensor should become isotropic. This paper examines the consequence of this prediction for\nthe inner parts of rich clusters of galaxies, where highly magnified images of background\ngalaxies are occasionally observed. We will find that severe restrictions on the collisional\ndark matter hypothesis are obtained.\n\n2.\n\nThe Collisional Radius in Dwarf Galaxies and in Galaxy Clusters\n\nWe assume that a halo of self-interacting dark matter has an initial density profile equal\nto the one for the case of collisionless dark matter, and is thereafter modified by the effects\nof the collisions. Numerical simulations of collisionless CDM models have shown that halos\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nhave a characteristic density profile, with a logarithmic slope that increases gradually with\nradius (Navarro, Frenk, & White 1996, 1997; Moore et al. 1999b). We define the radius\nrh where the logarithmic slope is equal to 2, so that |d log \u03c1/d log r| < 2 at r < rh , and\n|d log \u03c1/d log r| > 2 at r > rh . The particles closest to the center will be the first ones\nto collide, owing to the higher density. We define the collisional radius, rc , as the radius\nwithin which more than half the particles have interacted. The effects of the collisions will\nbe to change the velocity distribution of the particles inside the collisional radius toward\na Maxwellian distribution, with constant velocity dispersion. This implies that the density\nprofile within the collisional radius will be altered toward that of an isothermal sphere with\nfinite core. The core radius produced by the collisions can obviously not be larger than the\ncollisional radius, but it can be much smaller than the collisional radius if the initial slope\nof the halo profile inside rc was already close to isothermal, because the total energy needs\nto be conserved. Several numerical simulations have recently been done to model this effect\n(e.g., Burkert 2000, Yoshida et al. 2000, Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001).\nIn the initial density profile, the velocity dispersion should clearly decrease toward the\ncenter at r < rh : as long as the density profile has a central power-law cusp, and the orbits\nare not all highly radial near the center, then \u03c3 2 (r) \u221d \u03c1(r)r 2 . The collisions will therefore\ntransport heat to the colder central particles from the hotter exterior, destroying the cusp\nand slowly increasing the core of the isothermal sphere as the collisional radius increases.\nHowever, the particles at r > rh should have a decreasing velocity dispersion with radius\nin their initial configuration, so when rc > rh heat starts to be transported outward and\nthe isothermal core shrinks as more particles are slung to the outer parts of the halo (or to\nunbound orbits), leading eventually to core collapse. As discussed by Spergel & Steinhardt\n(2000), the cross section should be low enough so that the core collapse of the dark matter\nhas not taken place in any halos up to the present time.\nHow should the collisional radius vary with the velocity dispersion of a dark matter halo?\nWe assume that the cross section for the elastic collisions in the dark matter is independent\nof velocity, as expected in the low energy limit when the cross section is dominated by\nthe s-wave contribution (e.g., Landau & Lifshitz 1977). Then, the rate of interaction of\na particle is proportional to the dark matter density, \u03c1, times the velocity dispersion \u03c3.\nHence, \u03c1 \u03c3 t = constant, where t is the age of the halo (or the time since the last merger\nwhich determined an initial density profile). Assuming that the core of the halo is not larger\nthan the collisional radius, dynamical equilibrium implies \u03c1(rc ) \u221d \u03c3 2 /rc2 , and therefore,\nrc \u221d \u03c3 3/2 t1/2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThis implies that if the core radii in dwarf galaxies are caused by dark matter collisions\nwithin a larger collisional radius, then all the galactic and cluster dark matter halos should\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nhave much larger collisional radii as their velocity dispersion increases.\nTypically, the constant density cores of dwarf galaxy halos measured from the kinematics\nof the HI gas extend out to a few kpc, and a typical velocity dispersion is 50 km s\u22121 . As a\nfew examples, the rotation curves of the dwarfs DDO 154, DDO 170, and DDO 236 yield fits\nfor their dark matter halos with velocity dispersion \u03c3 = (28, 52, 45) km s\u22121 , and core radii\n(3, 2.5, 6) kpc ((Carignan & Beaulieu 1989); (2); (Jobin & Carignan 1990)), with assumed\ndistances of (4, 15, 1.7) Mpc, respectively.\nIf we wish to explain the sizes of these dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies as the result of\ncollisional dark matter, then the collisional radii of the halos of these dwarfs must be larger\nthan the observed core radii, and the collisional radii in rich clusters of galaxies must be\nmuch larger, according to (1). Using the conservative values of rc = 2 kpc and \u03c3 = 50 km s\u22121\nfor a typical dwarf galaxy, and assuming that a typical rich cluster is about a third as old\nas a dwarf galaxy (since massive halos have collapsed more recently than dwarf galaxies; see\nFig. 10 of Lacey & Cole 1993), we infer that the collisional radius of a typical rich cluster\nwith velocity dispersion \u03c3 = 1000 km s\u22121 should be at least rc > 100 kpc.\nWithin the collisional radius, the halo potential should be very nearly spherical because\nthe collisions should make the velocity dispersion tensor of the dark matter particles isotropic\n(unless the core is rapidly rotating, which is highly unlikely as will be discussed in \u00a74). This\nis most easily seen for a finite system, using the tensor virial theorem: the potential energy\ntensor (which reflects the shape of the mass distribution) will become diagonal over the\nsame timescale as the kinetic energy tensor. The next section discusses the evidence from\ngravitational lensing showing that cluster cores are elliptical in their inner parts, focusing in\nparticular on the example of MS2137-23.\n\n3.\n\nThe core of the cluster MS2137-23 is elliptical\n\nHighly magnified images of background galaxies (or \"arcs\") produced by gravitational\nlensing have been observed in many clusters of galaxies. In general, models that reproduce\nthe positions and shapes of these images assume the presence of elliptical clumps of dark matter centered on the most luminous galaxies in the cluster, with the ellipticity being oriented\nalong the same axis as the optical light. Examples of clusters that have been modeled in\nthis way include A370 ((Kneib et al. 1993)), A2218 ((Kneib et al. 1995)), MS2137-23 ((3)),\nand A2390 ((Pierre et al. 1996)). It should be noted that the optical isophotes of the central\ncluster galaxies generally extend out to the radius where the gravitationally lensed images\nare observed, where the potential is strongly dominated by the dark matter. The regular\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nelliptical isophotes of the distribution of stars implies that the gravitational potential has\nthe same shape, and this is confirmed by the lensing models that reproduce the positions\nand shapes of the multiple images of background galaxies.\nWe note here the intriguing fact that the isophotes of central cluster galaxies tend to\nshow a decrease of the ellipticity toward the center, within radii . 10 kpc (Porter et al.\n1991). This might plausibly be an indication of the effects of self-interacting dark matter\nat this small radius, making the potential more spherical; however, other dynamical effects\nassociated with the formation of these galaxies from mergers might also explain this if the\ndark matter is collisionless. In this paper, we will discuss the evidence that if there is selfinteracting dark matter, the collisional radius in rich clusters of galaxies should be smaller\nthan \u223c 100 kpc, leaving the question of whether there might a smaller collisional radius for\nfuture work.\nHere, we shall focus on the cluster MS2137-23. This cluster has several characteristics\nthat make it particularly useful for our purpose. First, the central region of the cluster\nappears to be well relaxed as shown from both the optical image, dominated by the central\ngalaxy, and the X-ray emission, centered on the galaxy and with an ellipticity and position\nangle similar to that of the central galaxy ((Hammer et al. 1997)). In clusters with substructure, the presence of multiple mass clumps requires models of the mass distribution\nwith many parameters, making it difficult to constrain the ellipticity of each mass clump.\nSecond, a total of five gravitationally lensed images arising from two sources are observed\nin MS2137-23, providing many constraints for the lensing model. Although redshifts for\nthese five images have not yet been measured, their morphologies and colors provide strong\nevidence for the lensing interpretation ((Hammer et al. 1997)). One source produces a long,\ntangential arc and two other arclets, and the second source gives rise to a radially elongated image near the center and another arclet (where \"arclet\" refers to images that are\nnot magnified by very large factors, but still show a characteristic stretching effect due to\nlensing).\nThe positions and relative sizes and shapes of these five images can be reproduced in an\nextremely simple model: an elliptical mass clump centered on the central galaxy, with the\nsame ellipticity and position angle ((3); (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1995)). This model needs only two\nfree parameters for the radial density profile (the velocity dispersion of the cluster and the\ncore radius). Since the positions of the five images alone already provide 6 constraints (ten\ncoordinates of the five images minus 4 for the unknown positions of the two sources), and\nin addition the relative sizes and orientations of each image are also reproduced, this should\nbe considered as strong evidence that the potential of the dark matter is elliptical, just like\nthe stellar isophotes, and has not been significantly circularized by dark matter collisions at\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe radius where the images are observed. This radius is 15\" for the longest tangential arc,\nwhich corresponds to 70 kpc (for H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). The radially elongated image is\nonly 5\" from the cluster center; however, if the potential became spherical only at this small\nradius, this radial image would not be significantly altered.\nCould other perturbations to the potential, arising from substructure (which causes\nexternal shear), mimic the effect of ellipticity if the true potential was spherical within\n\u223c 100 kpc? There are two arguments against this possibility. First, an external shear would\nbe roughly constant within the region of the multiple images, whereas an elliptical potential\ncauses a variable shear and convergence that depend on the density profile (see eqs. 2 to 8\nbelow). Second, there would be no reason why the external shear should be aligned with the\nmajor axis of the galaxy. While substructure is common in many clusters, the central parts\nof MS2137-23 appear relaxed, as discussed above.\nAlthough the fact that the simple elliptical potential, with constant ellipticity as a\nfunction of radius, fits the observed positions and shapes of the five images can already be\nconsidered as persuasive evidence that the potential cannot be spherical within \u223c 100 kpc,\nit will be useful to show analytically why an ellipticity is required in a model-independent\nmanner. We will focus here on the radial image and its counterimage. These two images\nof the same source are labeled as A1 and A5 in Mellier et al. (1993), and in Figure 1 of\nMiralda-Escud\u00e9 (1995), and as AR and A5 in the HST image presented in Hammer et al.\n(1997).\nA schematic representation of the lensing of the source on the radial caustic is shown in\nFigure 1, which defines the notation that will be used here. The point labeled C is the center\nof the cluster, and S is the position of the source that gives rise to the radial image at R and\nthe counterimage at I (the entire lensing configuration in this system, with the critical lines\nand caustics of a simple elliptical potential, is shown in Fig. 1 of Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1995). We\nuse polar coordinates on the image plane: \u03b8, the angular distance from the center C, and \u03c6,\nthe azimuthal angle. The light ray observed at R is deflected by an angle \u03b1\u03b8R in the radial\ndirection, and \u03b1\u03c6R in the azimuthal direction, and the same for the light ray observed at I.\nThe specific observed quantity that we will relate to the ellipticity of the potential is\nthe angle \u03b3 of misalignment between the images R and I, relative to the center of the lens.\nIn a spherical potential, the images R and I should lie on a straight line passing through C.\nThe observed angle is \u03b3 = 19\u25e6 , indicating that the potential is elliptical. In principle, this\nmisalignment could also be caused by substructure in the cluster, but this is unlikely in view\nof the relaxed appearance of the cluster.\nWe now relate the angle \u03b3 to the ellipticity and the density profile of the potential. If the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Schematic representation of the lensing configuration in the cluster MS2137-23\ndiscussed in \u00a73. The lens center is at C, the source is located at S, and its two images\nare observed at R (which is the image on the radial critical line) and I. The angle of\nmisalignment \u03b3 between the two images relative to the center would be zero for a spherical\npotential.

For this purpose, it will be convenient to replace the function \u03c81 (\u03b8)/\u03b8) by an\nupper limit. Using equation (5), we find that if the \u03ba0 is constant within \u03b8, then \u03c81 (\u03b8)/\u03b8 =\n\u03b8 \u03ba\u03040 (\u03b8)/2, while in any profile where \u03ba0 decreases with radius, we have \u03c81 (\u03b8)/\u03b8 < \u03b8 \u03ba\u03040 (\u03b8)/2,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nbecause the integral of equation (5) weights more heavily the surface density near \u03b8 than at\nsmaller angular radius.

Because the\ntwo images R and I result from radial (rather than tangential) magnification, there is no\nreason why \u03ba\u0304 needs to be particularly close to unity at either image. Given the relation\n[\u03ba\u03040 (\u03b8R ) \u2212 1]/[1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03040 (\u03b8I )] = \u03b8I /\u03b8R = 4.3, the quantity 1 \u2212 \u03ba\u0304(\u03b8I ) could be very small only if\nthe surface density profile was very flat between the angular radii \u03b8R and \u03b8I . This is very\nunlikely because the velocity dispersion implied for the cluster for an Einstein radius close\nto \u03b8I = 22\u2032\u2032.5 is already larger than 1000 km s\u22121 (see (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1995), Figs. 8 and 9),\nand it would increase to a much higher value at large radius if the slope of the density profile\nwas much shallower than isothermal at \u03b8 \u223c \u03b8I .\nAs a reasonable limit on how flat the \u03ba\u0304 profile could be from \u03b8R to \u03b8I , we will assume\nhere \u03ba\u0304(\u03b8R )/\u03ba\u0304(\u03b8I ) > 2 (remember that \u03b8I /\u03b8R = 4.3). This corresponds to 1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03040 (\u03b8I ) > 0.16,\nimplying that the image I is not tangentially magnified by more than a factor 6, which is\nreasonable given the length of the image I (called A5 in (Hammer et al. 1997)), \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 , and\nits axis ratio of \u223c 3.\nWith this condition, and using also cos(2\u03c6I ) \u2243 0.7 (e.g., Mellier et al. 1993; we assume\nthe major axis of the potential is aligned with that of the central galaxy), and \u03b3 = 0.33, the\nlower limit on the ellipticity from equation (12) is\n\u01eb > 0.77 [1 \u2212 \u03ba\u0304(\u03b8I )] & 0.1 .\n\n(13)\n\nThis is only a lower limit that we have obtained using only one observational constraint,\nthe misalignment of two images relative to the center. The models that reproduce also the\nthree images of the other source require an ellipticity \u01eb \u2243 0.2.\nThere are other clusters that show little substructure in their inner parts and are well\nmodelled by an elliptical potential with the major axis coinciding with that of the central\ngalaxy: one is A2218 (Kneib et al. 1995), which requires two clumps in the model, but with\nthe dominant agreeing in position and ellipticity with the central cluster galaxy. Another is\nA963, which shows two tangential arcs around the central giant elliptical (Lavery & Henry\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n1988). In the case of A963 the ellipticity is difficult to constrain because there are only two\nimages which could be from the same source or two different sources.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe modeling of multiple images of background galaxies produced by gravitational lensing in clusters of galaxies require elliptical models of the mass distribution in order to reproduce their positions and magnifications successfully ((Kneib et al. 1993); (3); (Kneib et al. 1995)).\nThe last section discussed the specific example of MS2137-23, where the misalignment in the\nposition of two images relative to the cluster center can be used to constrain the ellipticity in a model-independent way: the ellipticity of the dark matter halo around the central\ngalaxy must be greater than 0.1 within the image I, which is at 22\u2032\u2032.5 from the cluster center,\ncorresponding to a distance of 65h\u22121 kpc. The fact that the dark matter halos of galaxy\nclusters are elliptical within this small radius implies that the dark matter particles have not\ncollided over the age of the cluster. As shown in \u00a72, this also implies that the observed cores\nof the dark matter halos in dwarf galaxies are too big to have been caused by dark matter\nself-interaction, as proposed by Spergel & Steinhardt (2000).\nFurther evidence supporting that cluster dark matter halos are elliptical at radii \u223c 100\nkpc comes from the similarity with the ellipticity of the optical isophotes of the central\ncluster galaxies in both the magnitude of the ellipticity and the orientation of the major axis\n((3); (Kneib et al. 1993); (Kneib et al. 1995)). If the underlying dark matter distribution\nbecame spherical due to the collisions, the ellipticity of the stellar distribution would be\nreduced (although not eliminated, owing to the anisotropy in the velocity dispersion tensor).\nAccording to Hammer et al. (1997), the central galaxy in MS2137-23 has ellipticity \u01eb =\n0.16 \u00b1 0.02 beyond the radius of the radial arc, and the best fit ellipticity for the lens model\nis \u01eb = 0.18 (see also (Kneib et al. 1995) for similar conclusions obtained in the cluster A2218).\nWe note again that the ellipticities of the optical isophotes decline at a radius smaller than\nthat probed by gravitational lensing (Porter et al. 1991).\nThe ellipticity of the cluster halo can be used to place an upper limit on the interaction\nrate of the dark matter, in terms of the cross section sx and mass mx of the dark matter\nparticle. We assume here that the collisional radius must be smaller than the distance from\nthe center to the long tangential arc and two other arclets (these images are A01-A02, A2\nand A4 in (Hammer et al. 1997), and they also require an ellipticity similar to that of the\ncentral galaxy in the lensing models), which is about 70 kpc. The dark matter density at this\nradius is \u03c1 \u2243 \u03a3crit /2r, where the critical surface density is \u03a3crit \u2243 1 g cm\u22122 for a source at\nzs = 1. Assuming also a cluster velocity dispersion \u03c3 = 1000 km s\u22121 (roughly the minimum\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nvalue required given the Einstein radius of the cluster), and a cluster age tc = 5 \u00d7 109 years,\nwe obtain the upper limit\n2\nsx\n1\ncm2\n\u221225.5 cm\n<\n\u2243\n10\n\u2243\n0.02\n.\nmx\n\u03c1 21/2 \u03c3 tc\nmp\ng\n\n(14)\n\nFor the dwarf galaxies DDO 154, DDO 170, and DDO 236 mentioned in \u00a72, with velocity\ndispersion \u03c3 = (28, 52, 45) km s\u22121 , and core radii (3, 2.5, 6) kpc, the time it would take for the\ncollisional radius to reach the value of their core radii if sx /mx were equal to the above upper\nlimit is t = (40, 5, 40) \u00d7 1010 years, respectively [where we have used the relation t \u221d \u03c3 3 /rc2 ,\nfrom eq. (1) ].\nThe limit we have obtained on the self-interaction of the dark matter also rules it out as\nan explanation for the low abundance of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, compared to the\npredictions of halo satellites abundances from numerical simulations ((Klypin et al. 1999);\n(Moore et al. 1999a)). In order to strike out the dark matter particles, the satellite halos\nmust be moving in an orbit inside the collisional radius. For example, in the Milky Way\nhalo (with \u03c3 \u2243 150 km s\u22121 ), the collisional radius cannot be greater than about 6 kpc, if\nrc < 100 kpc in a cluster with \u03c3 = 1000 km s\u22121 (where we use the scaling rc \u221d \u03c3 3/2 ).\nFinally, we mention three ways by which the collisional dark matter hypothesis might\nstill remain viable as an explanation of the constant density cores observed in some dwarf\ngalaxies. A first possibility is that the presence of substructure in the mass distribution of\nMS2137-23, or of other massive structures projected on the line of sight of the cluster, introduces an external shear that would modify the positions of the images. However, this seems\nunlikely as discussed in \u00a73, because elliptical models fit the observed positions and shapes\nof the images remarkably well with fewer model parameters than observational constraints,\nand an external shear induces a lensing potential different than a constant ellipticity, and\nwould not generally be aligned with the major axis of the galaxy. The second possibility is\nthat the ellipticity of the dark matter could be supported by rotation, instead of anisotropic\nvelocity dispersion. However, halos formed by collisionless collapse are known to rotate very\nslowly ((Barnes & Efstathiou 1987); (Warren et al. 1992)), and the collisions would further\nslow down the rotation of the central parts of the halo by enforcing solid body rotation. Finally, there is the possibility that the cross section for the dark matter interaction decreases\nwith velocity. Here we have assumed the cross section to be constant; if it were proportional\nto v \u22121 (see, e.g., Firmani et al. 2000), then the constraints we have used here from gravitational lensing in clusters of galaxies would allow a large enough collisional radius in dwarfs\nto explain their dark matter core radii.\nI am grateful to Andy Gould, Paul Steinhardt and David Weinberg for discussions and\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nfor their encouragement.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nBahcall, N., Ostriker, J.
