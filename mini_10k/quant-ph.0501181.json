Lett. 77, 2154 (1996)].\nPACS numbers: 42.50.-p, 32.80.Lg, 03.65.Ud\n\nYoung's double-slit experiment may be considered as an emblematic example to introduce the wave-particle duality,\nwhich, to quote Feynman [1], is the basic mystery of Quantum Mechanics (QM). This experiment is frequently\ndiscussed in the introductory part of QM textbooks [2] to explain how the interference pattern and the which-way\ninformation on the particle trajectory are mutually exclusive behaviors in QM. Moreover, this wave-particle dualism\nbelongs to the enlarged contest of complementarity [3, 4], which has its root in the superposition principle. Coherent\nsuperposition of two states or, more generally, of two quantum paths leads to interference effects which may manifest\nitself as probability oscillations of some \"populations\". For example, when a two-level atom interacts with the field\nof an optical cavity, the atomic level populations undergo to the well known Rabi oscillations. But, what is the\ninterference effect underlying this phenomenon? In other words, which paths do interfere?\nWhen the atomic external degrees of freedom are included in the model, the internal dynamics of the atom correlates\nwith the translational variables. This information transfer towards the atomic external variables is at the origin of an\nintrinsic decoherence effect, that is, it causes a non dissipative damping of the Rabi oscillations [5, 6]. Non dissipative\ndamping of Rabi oscillations has been observed experimentally [7, 8] and it has also been analyzed by Bonifacio et.\nal. who consider the evolution time as random variable [9]. In this letter we will show that a damping also affects all\nthe correlations functions which are involved in the Bell inequality [10] and in the separability criterion [11, 12] for\nthe field and atomic internal variables. Can this decoherence be interpreted as a \"which-way\" information effect? In\nthis Letter we will try to throw light on these questions.\nLet us consider a two-level atom interacting with the field of an optical cavity. In the rotating wave approximation\n(RWA) the atom-field interaction is described by the Hamiltonian ~\u01eb sin kx\u0302(\u00e2\u2020 \u015c\u2212 + \u00e2 \u015c+ ) , where the usual spin\n1/2 operators refer to the internal dynamics of the two-level atom, while \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 are the annihilation and creation\noperators for the photons of k-mode of the cavity standing wave and \u01eb is the atom-field coupling constant. The atom\nenters the cavity moving prevalently along a direction orthogonal to the x-cavity axis, and we assume that the atomic\nvelocity along this direction is large enough to treat classically this component of the motion. This interaction is at\nthe heart of the optical Stern-Gerlach effect [13], and it takes a form very similar to the magnetic case introducing a\nnew set of \"spin\" operators\n(\u03bc\u0302x , \u03bc\u0302y , \u03bc\u0302z ) = (\n\n\u00e2\u2020 \u015c\u2212 + \u00e2\u015c+ \u00e2\u2020 \u015c\u2212 \u2212 \u00e2\u015c+ \u02c6\np\np\n,i\n, Sz ),\n2 N\u0302\n2 N\u0302\n\n(1)\n\nwhich satisfy in fact the algebra of a spin 1/2, [\u03bc\u0302x , \u03bc\u0302y ] = i\u03bc\u0302z et cycl., where N\u0302 = \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u015cz + 12 . We assume that the\ntransverse spatial distribution of the incoming atom is given by a packet of width \u2206x0 narrow with respect to the\nwavelength \u03bb of the resonant mode, and centered near a nodal point of the cavity function. In these conditions the\nsinusoidal mode function of the cavity standing-wave can be approximated by the linear term [14]. In the resonance\nconditions the optical Stern-Gerlach Hamiltonian reads\n\u0124 =\n\np\u03022\n+ ~\u03c9 N\u0302 + ~\u03a9\u0302x \u03bc\u0302x ,\n2m\n\n(2)\n\np\nwhere p\u0302 is the conjugate momentum of the position observable x\u0302, m is the mass of the particle and \u03a9\u0302x = 2\u01ebk N\u0302 x\u0302.\nThe kinetic term of this Hamiltonian accounts for the atomic translational degree of freedom along the x-direction.\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Momentum distribution (Eq.(7)) for a two-level atom entering the cavity in the state |\u03c6(0)i |ei and interacting with\nthe vacuum state |0i of the cavity field; \u03c6(p, 0) is a Gaussian packet of minimum uncertainty, with zero mean value of p\u0302 and\n\u2206p0 /~k = 25/2\u03c0 , corresponding to \u2206x0 /\u03bb = 1/50 .

A similar damping affects the correlation functions of Eqs.(12) and (13), which state the conditions\nfor the violation of the Bell's inequality and for the separability, respectively.\n\nGerlach effect. The mechanical action of the light causes the splitting of the atomic packet into two peaks which\nbecome distinguishable for interaction time sufficiently large (a few period of the Rabi frequency). This behaviour\nowns some interesting and quite surprising features. The exchange of momentum (through the photons exchange)\nbetween the atom and the cavity walls cannot be a full random process since, in this case, we would expect a single\npeak, centered in the initial mean value of p\u0302. On the contrary, both the Fig.1 and the Eqs.(4) and (5) suggest that\nthis exchange can follow, in a single experiment, only one of two mutually exclusive quantum paths. The momentum\nexchange behaves as only one cavity side or the other should be involved with the same probability (because of the\nparticular initial state), and the Rabi oscillations do emerge as a consequence of a coherent superposition of these\ntwo quantum paths. According to this scenario, it has been recently shown [6] that the one-sided atomic deflection\naccompanies with the so-called atomic coherent trapping [15], in which the atomic internal population is trapped into\nits initial value. In this extreme case the particular initial configuration will cause the disappearing of one of the two\nquantum paths, and the Rabi oscillations are absent since the beginning. Certainly, the which-way information on\nthese two possibilities cannot be acquired by looking at the walls of the cavity, which are absent from the model (2)\n(this is equivalent to assume an infinite mass for the walls). However, we can obtain an indirect which-path information\nby looking at the momentum distribution of the deflected atom. For interaction times sufficiently large, the two peaks\nof the atomic momentum are distinguishable (see curves (c) and (d) of Fig.1), and, in the single experiment, one may\nbe acquainted with the quantum path the system has followed. At the same time, the interference effects go to zero,\nas the damping of the Rabi oscillations shows (see Fig.2).\nThe correlations between the internal and the translational atomic dynamics as displayed in Eq.(4) lead to a drastic\nchange in the time behavior of the internal variables with respect to the usual Jaynes-Cummings model, in which the\natomic external variables are disregarded.

For example, if the initial translational state is given by a\nGaussian distribution of minimum uncertainty \u2206x0 \u2206p0 = ~/2, centered in x0 and with zero mean velocity along the\ncavity axis, for the scalar product of Eq.(8) we have\n\u001b\n\u001a\n[p+ (t) \u2212 p\u2212 (t)]2\n[x+ (t) \u2212 x\u2212 (t)]2\n,\n(9)\n\u2212\n\u03c6\u2212 (t)|\u03c6+ (t) = e\u2212i \u03a9 t exp \u2212\n8\u2206x20\n8\u2206p20\nwhere x\u00b1 (t) = x0 \u2213 a t2 /2, p\u00b1 (t) = \u2213m a t and \u03a9 = 2 m a x0 /~. As Eq.(9) shows, the scalar product between the\ntwo translational components |\u03c6\u00b1 (t)i depends on the distance in the phase space of the same components. When\nthe distance is sufficiently large the scalar product goes to zero, the two paths become distinguishable and their\ninterference effects vanish. We wish to outline that this non dissipative damping of the Rabi oscillations shown in\nFig.2, may be considered as an intrinsic decoherence effect: It originates inside the optical Stern-Gerlach model of\nEq.(2), without claiming any sort of reservoir action. It is to notice that the modulus of the scalar product (9)\nessentially measures the visibility V (of the Rabi oscillations) as given by Englert [16]. We recall that, in our case,\n(i)\nthe translational dynamics plays the role of the detector, i.e., with the notation of Ref.[16], \u03c1D = |\u03c6(0)i h\u03c6(0)|,\n\n\f4\n(+)\n\n(\u2212)\n\n\u03c1D = |\u03c6+ i h\u03c6+ | and \u03c1D = |\u03c6\u2212 i h\u03c6\u2212 |. Similarly it is possible to obtain the complementary quantity\n\u00111\n\u0010\n2 2\n.\nD = 1 \u2212 \u03c6+ |\u03c6\u2212\n\n(10)\n\nThe distinguishability D assumes a very simple form because the initial state of the detector is a pure state. As\npointed by Englert, \"the ways cannot be distinguished at all if D = 0\" (when V =1) \"and they can be held apart\ncompletely if D = 1\" (when V =0). Due to the purity of the initial state, the equality\nD2 + V2 = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03c6+ |\u03c6\u2212\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03c6+ |\u03c6\u2212\n\n2\n\n=1\n\nis satisfied at any time. In this contest the appearance of the damping of the Rabi oscillations can be related\nto a visibility degradation. On the other hand, since the quantum paths become distinguishable and a which-way\ninformation is accessible, the quantum nature of the atom-field correlations is vanishing. Consider the reduced density\noperator describing the field and the atomic internal dynamics. Giving up the information about the external variables\nby tracing the density operator of the state Eq.(4) over the translational variables we get\n\u0001\u0003\n1 \u0002 +\n\u03c1=\n(11)\n\u03c7+ + \u03c7\u2212 \u03c7\u2212 + \u03c6\u2212 (t)|\u03c6+ (t) \u03c7+ \u03c7\u2212 + h.c. .\n\u03c7\n2\nWe now investigate the nature of the atom-field correlations in terms of the Bell's inequality. Because of its simplicity,\nwe consider the Horodecki family formulation [17], which is equivalent to the standard Clauser, Horne, Shimony,\nHolt, (CHSH) formulation [18], when a bipartite system of spin 1/2 is involved, as in our case. The test reads: A\ndensity matrix \u03c1 describing a system composed by two spin 1/2 subsystems violates some Bell's inequality in the CHSH\nformulation if and only if the relation M (\u03c1) > 1 is satisfied. The quantity M (\u03c1) can be defined as follows. Consider\nthe 3 \u00d7 3 matrix T\u03c1 with coefficients tn,m = tr(\u03c1 \u03c3n \u2297 \u03c3m ), where \u03c3n are the standard Pauli matrices. Diagonalizing\nthe symmetric matrix U\u03c1 = T\u03c1T * T\u03c1 (T\u03c1T is the transpose of T\u03c1 ), and denoting two greater eigenvalues of U\u03c1 by \u03bb1 and\n\u03bb2 , then M (\u03c1) = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 . In our case we find\n\u0002\n\u0001\u00032\nM (\u03c1) = 1 + Im \u03c6\u2212 (t)|\u03c6+ (t)\n.\n(12)\nLooking at the Eqs. (3) and (9) it is evident that our system, which is initially non correlated, becomes, as the\natom-field interaction time increases, non-locally correlated. Quite interestingly, at the same time the atomic external\ndynamics, which makes accessible the which-way information, starts to damp this non-locality. Since the violation of\nthe Bell's inequality is just a sufficient condition for non-locality, it may be useful to consider the separability [11, 12]\nof the density matrix because it is a sufficient condition for both the locality and the classical correlation. After a few\nperiods of Rabi oscillations the damping factor involved in the scalar product (9), determines the separability of the\nP\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\nsystem in the sense that it is possible to set it in the form \u03c1 = \u221e\nand Wr are states\nr Wr \u2297 Wr , where Wr\nr=1\nPp\u221e\ncorresponding to the single subsystems and pr are probabilities ( r=1 pr = 1). To test this possibility in a more\nquantitative way we consider the eigenvalues of the partial transpose [11] \u03c3\u03c1 of the matrix \u03c1. A necessary and sufficient\ncondition for separability reads [11, 19]: \u03c1 is separable if and only if all the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u03c1 are non-negative. In our\ncase the test writes\n\u0001\nIm \u03c6\u2212 (t)|\u03c6+ (t)\n\u2264 0.\n(13)\n\nBecause of the correlations with the atomic external variables the classicality of the correlations between the field and\nthe atomic internal variables is recovered, as explicitly shown by the diagonal form \u03c1 = 21 (|ei he|\u2297|0i h0|+|gi hg|\u2297|1i h1|)\nthat the density matrix (11) assumes after a few Rabi periods (when h\u03c6\u2212 (t)|\u03c6+ (t)i \u2192 0). It is intriguing the fact that\nthe which-way information can be accessible just when the quantum nature of the atomic translational dynamics is\ntaken into account.\n\nIn conclusion, the interaction between the cavity field and the internal atomic variables can pursue two mutually exclusive quantum paths. Due to the correlation with the atomic external variables, these two paths cause the\nwell known optical Stern-Gerlach effect, that is, the atomic translational packet splits into two parts. When these\nare sufficiently separate, a which way information becomes accessible, and all the correlations functions involved in\nthe Bell's inequality, in the separability criterion, and in the Rabi oscillations go exponentially to zero, showing a\npropensity towards a classical behavior. In a forthcoming paper we will use the same model to prove how the atomic\ntranslational effects make more difficult the violation of Bell's inequality for massive particles.\n\n[1] R. Feynman, R.
