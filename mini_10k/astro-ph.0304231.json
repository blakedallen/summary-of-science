However, X-rays from several young BDs with ages t \u223c1 Myr old were discovered with ROSAT in nearby star forming regions (Neuh\u00e4user & Comer\u00f3n 1998; Neuh\u00e4user,\nBriceno & Comer\u00f3n. 1999, Mokler & Stelzer 2002). After the launch of the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory, the number of X-ray-detected young BDs has increased an order of magnitude\n(Garmire et al. 2000, Imanishi, Koyama & Tsuboi 2001, Imanishi, Tsujimoto & Koyama\n2001, Preibisch & Zinnecker 2001, Feigelson et al. 2002a). In young stellar clusters around\n1 Myr old, hard and variable X-rays are now detected from about 1/4 of the BD population\nnear the 'saturation level' of log LX /Lbol \u2243 \u22123. These properties are indistinguishable from\nthose of higher mass young objects which will evolve into dM stars.\nNearly all field L- and T-type older BDs with ages t \u2243 500\u20131000 Myr lack H\u03b1 emission,\na classical signature of active regions and plage, but exhibit radio flares (Gizis et al. 2000,\nBerger 2002). The weak H\u03b1 in field BDs is particularly surprising in light of their rapid\nrotation (Basri 2001). One field BD at age t \u2243 500 Myr, however, is clearly magnetically\nactive. LP944-20 showed a 1\u20132 hr flare during a Chandra observation with a peak luminosity\nLX = 1 \u00d7 1026 erg s\u22121 (log LX /Lbol \u2243 \u22124.1) with a surprisingly soft spectrum, while it\nexhibited no detectable quiescent X-rays before the flaring (Rutledge et al. 2000). This BD\nalso has exceptionally strong radio emission (Berger et al. 2001) and shows H\u03b1 emission of\nEW \u223c 1 \u00c5 (Tinney 1998). At the intermediate age of t \u2243 100 Myr, three probable BDs in\nthe Pleiades have been observed with XMM \u2212 Newton of which one, Roque 9, may have\nbeen detected at log LX /Lbol \u2243 \u22122.6 (Briggs & Pye 2002, Stelzer & Neuh\u00e4user 2002).\nThe evolution of magnetic activity in BDs thus appears confusing: H\u03b1 and X-rays\nappear to decay as they descend the Hayashi tracks and cool, while radio emission does\nnot. The nonthermal radio emission is particularly puzzling with both flare and persistent\ncomponents far stronger than expected from the well-established G\u00fcdel-Benz radio/X-ray\nrelationship that holds for all other late-type stars (Berger 2002). This contrasts with the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ntheoretical expectation that BD surface magnetic activity should decay with age due to\nincreased resistivity of the atmosphere (Mohanty et al. 2002). The evolution of magnetic\nactivity in higher mass late-type stars is also not fully understood. Various multiwavelength\nmanifestations of magnetic activity (X-ray flares, radio flares, H\u03b1 emission, large starspots,\nstrong surface fields, etc.) are consistently seen at high levels in T Tauri stars, but do not\nappear to depend on rotation as seen in main sequence stars (Feigelson & Montmerle 1999,\nFeigelson et al. 2003).\nWe introduce to this issue the Chandra detection of TWA 5B, a BD at the intermediate\nage of t \u2243 12 Myr. TWA 5B is a faint red object (H = 12 mag) located 2\u2032\u2032 north of\nand co-moving with TWA 5A which itself is a spectroscopic binary (Lowrance et al. 1999,\nWebb et al. 1999, Neuh\u00e4user et al. 2000). This system is part of the dispersed TW Hydra\nAssociation (TWA) of T Tauri stars, all of which are likely outliers of the giant Sco-Cen\nOB association (Kastner et al. 1997, Mamajek et al. 2000). TWA 5 is the first identified\nPMS star-BD binary system with an estimated age of 12 \u00b1 6 Myr (Weintraub et al. 2000).\nWe assume here the mean Hipparcos distance to the 4 brightest TWA members of 55 pc.\nOptical and near-infrared photometry of TWA 5B gives a spectral type of M8.5\u2212M9 and\nbolometric luminosity log Lbol /L\u2299 \u2243 \u22122.6 \u00b1 0.3, giving an inferred mass between 15 and 40\nMjup (Neuh\u00e4user et al. 2000). The equivalent width of H\u03b1 \u223c20\u00c5 lies between those of young\nBDs (10\u2013100 \u00c5 at \u223c1 Myr old) and those of field BDs (. 1 \u00c5 at \u223c500\u20135000 Myr). TWA\n5B is thus clearly an intermediate-age BD and may be near the end of its brief deuterium\nburning phase (Weintraub et al. 2000). The inferred mass is not far from the boundary\nbetween a brown dwarf and a planet of about 12 Mjup .\n\n2.\n\nObservations and results\n\nTWA 5B was observed on 2001 April 15 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory for 10.3\nks using the ACIS-S detector (see Weisskopf et al. 2002 for a description of the satellite and\ninstrument). The S3 CCD chip was operated in a rapid readout subarray mode to reduce\nphoton pileup of the primary TWA 5A which was known from ROSAT studies to be very\nbright (Webb et al. 1999). The more frequent readouts resulted in a net on-target exposure\nof 9.3 ks. Image analysis started with Level 1 events from which we removed a \u00b1 0\u2032\u2032 .25\npositional randomization, filtered with Good Time Intervals, and corrected charge transfer\ninefficiency problem as described by Townsley et al. (2000). To achieve the highest possible\nspatial resolution, we applied a correction to estimate the arrival location of each photon\nwithin each 0\u2032\u2032 .5 pixel based on the precise distribution of charge received in adjacent pixels\n(Tsunemi et al. 2001, Mori et al. 2001). Spectral analysis was performed using Level 2 events\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nprovided by the standard satellite pipeline processing.\nVisual examination of the raw (Level 2) ACIS S3 CCD image shows very strong emission\nwith about 6200 counts from TWA 5A, a CCD readout stripe oriented NE/SW, and a faint\nexcess of events 2\u2032\u2032 to the north where TWA 5B lies. The TWA 5B emission becomes much\nclearer after the special processing steps outlined above. Figure 1 (center) shows this X-ray\nimage in a very soft 0.1\u20131.2 keV band that highlights the emission from the BD companion.\nNote that a resolution of \u2243 0\u2032\u2032 .3 FWHM is achieved using the subpixel process, while the\noriginal data has \u2243 0\u2032\u2032 .5 FWHM (these FWHM values are measured from radial profile\nbinned by 0.05 pixel.)\nWe extracted 35 photons from standard Level 2 event list around TWA 5B in the 0.1\u20138\nkeV band using a 0\u2032\u2032 .7 radius circle after removal of background from an annulus around\nTWA 5A (see Figure 1, right panel). Since the extracted region is smaller than the standard\nChandra point spread function at this position, a modified 'auxiliary reference file' was\ncreated. The background-subtracted spectrum of TWA 5B was fitted with an optically\nthin MEKAL thermal plasma model with elemental abundances fixed at 0.3 times of the\nsolar value, based on the fitting results of other young stellar objects (YSOs) detected by\nChandra and ASCA (e.g. Imanishi, Koyama, & Tsuboi 2001). The resulting spectrum,\nshown in Figure 2, is unusually soft with peak emission at 0.7 keV and no photons above\n1.5 keV. Best-fit parameters with 90% confidence levels are: temperature kT = 0.3+0.2\n\u22120.1 keV,\n20\n\u22122\n50\nline-of-sight column density NH < 6 \u00d7 10 cm , emission measure 4 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10 cm\u22123 , and\nluminosity LX = 4 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 in the 0.1\u20138 keV band. The spectral fit was essentially\nperfect with reduced chi-squared of 0.5 for 3 degrees of freedom. The plasma temperature and\nthe luminosity are close to typical plasma conditions in the Sun today: at solar maximum,\ntypical temperatures are kT \u2243 0.2\u20130.5 keV with LX \u2243 1 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 (Peres et al. 2000).\nDuring a powerful solar flare, the typical temperatures rise to T \u2243 1\u20132 keV, much hotter\nthan seen in TWA 5B but typical of other PMS stars and BDs (e.g. Feigelson et al. 2002a).\nA light curve of the photon arrival times was examined and no significant variations\nwere found during the 11 ks duration of the observation. We can exclude variations greater\nthan 50% in amplitude over the 10 ks observation.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nEvolution of X-ray emission\n\nAs outlined in the Introduction, there is considerable confusion in our understanding of\nthe evolution of BD magnetic activity. Figure 3 shows our current knowledge of the rela-\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ntionship between X-ray emission, parameterized as LX /Lbol and the age of BDs. The X-ray\nproperties for BDs in the Orion Nebula, \u03c1 Ophiuchi and IC 348 are obtained from Chandra\nACIS data by Feigelson et al. (2002a), Imanishi, Tsujimoto & Koyama (2001), and Preibisch\n& Zinnecker (2001), respectively. The field BD LP 944-20 detection is from Rutledge et al.\n(2000). Individual BD ages are distributed randomly for one order of magnitudes centered\non 0.4 Myr (\u03c1 Oph, Orion) and 1.5 Myr (IC348) based on Luhman et al. (2000). For Orion,\nthe upper-limits of X-ray undetected brown dwarfs were obtained as described in Feigelson\net al. (2002a, equations 7 and 10) assuming negligible absorbing column and bolometric\nluminosities from Hillenbrand and Carpenter (2000). The data of LP 944-20 are separately\nshown for the flare, the upper limit at the quiescent (pre-flare) phase and the time-average\nduring full observation, while the others are shown only for the last one (full observations).\nExcept for LP 944-20, only two sources in \u03c1 Oph and one in IC348 have clear flares with\namplitudes less than a factor of ten, which are within the range of the data scattering of\neach field. TWA 5B at log LX /Lbol = \u22123.4 lies just below the \u22123.0 saturation limit in main\nsequence clusters and is consistent with the BDs seen in younger clusters.\nAlthough a clear conclusion cannot be made from one object, this result is consistent\nwith a continued high level of BD X-ray surface activity through t \u2243 12 Myr. The decay to\nlower levels would then occur during the 107 \u2013108 yr phase, considering the averaged level of\nLP 944-20. This is consistent with the nearly constant (or even slightly rising; see Feigelson\net al. 2003) log LX /Lbol distribution from t < 1 Myr through t \u2243 20 Myr seen in higher\nmass late-type stars. The high level in log LX /Lbol in younger phase might be related to the\ndeuterium burning, with the fact that TWA 5B lies just at the end of the burning phase\n(Weintraub et al. 2000).\nA somewhat different result emerges from consideration of the relationship between Xray plasma temperature and age in BDs (Figure 4). Here the temperatures are derived from\nspectral fits to Chandra ACIS data by the authors listed above. While very young BDs\nhave hotter temperatures above 1 keV, the intermediate-age BD TWA 5B is significantly\ncooler at kT \u2243 0.3 keV similar to the temperature found in the flare of the older LP 944-20\n(Rutledge et al. 2000). However, the low temperature in TWA 5B, combined with the lack of\nvariability, suggests that its X-ray emission arises more from a 'corona' than a single 'flare'.\nWhile a similar trend from hotter plasma to cooler plasma is seen in higher-mass YSOs,\nthe timescale for this transition is much longer than implied for BDs. X-ray temperatures\nare typically kT \u2243 6 keV for protostars (e.g. Imanishi, Koyama, & Tsuboi 2001) and\nkT \u2243 1 \u2212 4 keV for typical T Tauri stars (e.g. Feigelson et al. 2002a), with highly variable\nflare-dominated lightcurves. This hotter plasma is dominated by cooler coronal plasma only\nafter \u2243 500 Myrs (G\u00fcdel, Guinan & Skinner 1997).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nIt is interesting that the plasma temperature in LP 944-20 flaring is similar to that in\nTWA 5B quiescent. Considering that the X-ray luminosity of the LP 944-20 flaring is at\nleast an order of magnitudes less than that of TWA 5B quiescent, the X-rays of TWA 5B,\nwhich appear like coronal emission, might be explained by a superposition of a number of\nsuch small flares. The similar possibility has been suggested and examined for the solar\ncorona (Parker 1988, Shimizu & Tsuneta 1997).\n\n3.2.\n\nComments on the relationship between X-ray and H\u03b1 emissions\n\nFigure 5 shows our current knowledge of the relationship between X-ray emission, parameterized as LX /Lbol and the H\u03b1 equivalent widths of BDs. In this plot, the ordinate indicates the X-ray surface brightness at the BD surface, while the abscissa represents the H\u03b1\nsurface brightness, in the zero's order. Here the H\u03b1 properties are obtained from Jayawardhana, Mohanty & Basri (2002) for BDs in the \u03c1 Ophiuchi, Luhman (1999) and Herbig (1998)\nfor those in IC 348, and Tinney (1998) for the field BD LP 944-20. For the time-averaged\nX-rays of detected BDs, we obtained a correlation of log(LX /Lbol ) = 1.5 \u00d7 log(H\u03b1) \u2212 5.3.\nSuch correlation has been already known in higher mass weak-lined T Tauri stars (for a recent example; Preibisch & Zinnecker 2002), which is interpreted by the hypothesis that the\nchromosphere (traced by the H\u03b1 activity) is heated by a sufficient overlying corona (X-ray\nactivity) (Cram 1982).\nFigure 5 also shows that the strongest six (\u223c100 \u00c5) in the H\u03b1 equivalent width were not\ndetected in X-rays. As with higher mass classical T Tauri stars, these strong emission lines\nwould be accompanied by IR disks. The relation given in Figure 5 is thus straightforwardly\ninterpreted by the scenario that X-rays are mainly due to the coronal activity while H\u03b1 is\ndominated by the chromospheric activity (. a few tens \u00c5) and by the disk activity (& a few\ntens \u00c5). These nondetections also suggest that BD X-ray activity does not likely originate\nfrom star-disk interaction but from the solar-like magnetic activity.\n\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe report the detection of X-rays from an intermediate-age (t \u2243 12 Myr) BD at a level\nof LX \u2243 4 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 (0.1\u201310 keV band) or log LX /Lbol = \u22123.4. The X-ray spectrum is\nvery soft; the dominant plasma temperature is only 0.3 keV. No variability is seen during\nthe 10.3 ks observation. Those characteristics are common to those in the solar corona.\nOur observation provides a link between the active state seen in younger t \u2243 1 Myr stellar\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nclusters, and a relatively inactive state, showing continuity in the evolution of both X-ray\nluminosity and plasma temperature: log LX /Lbol has not yet decayed by t \u2243 12 Myr while\nkT has already substantially cooled. The correlation between X-rays and H\u03b1 implies the\nidea that the X-rays are mainly due to the coronal activity while H\u03b1 is dominated by the\nchromospheric activity (. a few tens \u00c5) and by the disk activity (& a few tens \u00c5). Finally,\nwe note that since TWA 5B is not far from the boundary between BDs and the most massive\nplanets found orbiting nearby stars, it raises the possibility that massive planets might emit\nX-ray during their youth.\nWe express our thanks to all the Chandra team for many efforts of the fabrication of\nsatellite, launching, daily operation, software developments and calibrations. We also thank\nLeisa Townsley for supplying the CTI corrector of ACIS and Kensuke Imanishi the referee\nGibor Basri for useful comments on brown dwarf flares and coronae.
