Surveys \u2013 Catalogs \u2013 Techniques: photometric\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is the largest photometric and spectroscopic survey in the optical wavelength\nrange. The SDSS is mapping one quarter of the entire sky and\nis measuring positions and magnitudes for over 100 million\ncelestial objects (York et al. 2000; Grebel 2001). The SDSS\nphotometric system was specifically designed for the survey\n(Fukugita et al. 1996; Smith et al. 2002), but many observatories worldwide have since purchased SDSS filters as well.\nThe five SDSS ugriz filters are a modified Thuan-Gunn system (Thuan & Gunn 1976). Their most prominent feature are\nthe wide passbands, which cover an effective wavelength range\nof \u223c 380 nm to \u223c 920 nm, and the lack of overlap between\nneighboring passbands. These properties ensure a high efficiency for faint object measurements, independent spectral information in each band, and coverage of essentially the entire\noptical wavelength range accessible from the ground.\n\u22c6\n\nGuest User, Canadian Astronomy Data Centre, which is operated\nby the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory for the National Research\nCouncil of Canada's Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.\n\nThe SDSS provides a photometric catalog of unprecedented\ndepth, homogeneity, and quality. Owing to the magnitude of\nthe data that are becoming publicly available in this new photometric system (Stoughton et al. 2002; Abazajian et al. 2003,\n2004, 2005; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2006), it is important to\nhave well-calibrated transformation relations between this system and traditional photometric systems such as the JohnsonCousins system (Johnson & Morgan 1953; Cousins 1976). It\nis easy to imagine situations where one wishes to know, e.g.,\nthe V-band magnitude of a star of interest that happens to\nbe in the SDSS database and for which no other photometry\nis available. Moreover, the large area coverage of the SDSS\nand the high quality of its drift-scan photometry make it also\nsuitable as a source of 'tertiary standards', although there is\nno information on variability for the majority of the SDSS\nobjects. This disadvantage is compensated by the large number of photometered sources even within a small patch of the\nsky. Thus a few variable objects will merely appear as outliers and will not have a major effect on a photometric transformation. Also, if observations in a traditional photometric\nsystem are being obtained during a non-photometric night,\nexisting transformable SDSS photometry of the same field\n\n\f2\n\nK. Jordi et al.: Empirical Color Transformations Between SDSS Photometry and Other Photometric Systems\n\nwill prove very useful for at least an approximate photometric calibration (Koch et al. 2004a,b). Other large-area photometric survey catalogs are already being used in this manner;\nfor instance, Udalski et al. (1998, 2000, 2002); Epchtein et al.\n(1999); Zaritsky et al. (2002, 2004); Skrutskie et al. (2006).\nPrior to the start of SDSS observations, Fukugita et al.\n(1996) derived theoretical transformation relations between\nthe Johnson-Cousins system and the SDSS u\u2032 g\u2032 r\u2032 i\u2032 z\u2032 system.\nThe primes refer to the filter-detector combination envisioned\nto be used at the 20\u2032\u2032 photometric monitoring telescope at\nApache Point Observatory. This auxiliary telescope observes\nSDSS photometric standards while the science observations\nare done in drift-scan mode with the actual SDSS survey telescope, a dedicated 2.5-m telescope at the same site (see, e.g.,\nYork et al. (2000); Stoughton et al. (2002); Gunn et al. (2006)).\nFukugita et al. (1996) calculated synthetic magnitudes using\nthe planned filter-detector combinations and spectral energy\ndistributions of stars from the Gunn & Stryker (1983) spectrophotometric atlas. These synthetic magnitudes were then\nused to determine photometric transformations.\nSmith et al. (2002) calculated transformations between the\nSDSS u\u2032 g\u2032 r\u2032 i\u2032 z\u2032 system and the Johnson\u2013Cousins photometric\nsystem based on actual observations in u\u2032 g\u2032 r\u2032 i\u2032 z\u2032 filters. In this\ncontext the primes refer to the SDSS filter-detector combination used at the 1.0-m telescope at the US Naval Observatory\n(USNO), Flagstaff Station. These observations were used to set\nup a system of 158 bright standard stars that define the u\u2032 g\u2032 r\u2032 i\u2032 z\u2032\nsystem and to derive the above mentioned transformation equations. Smith et al. (2002) point out that there are \"small but\nsignificant\" differences between the USNO SDSS filters and\nthe SDSS filters used at the 2.2-m telescope at Apache Point\nObservatory, leading to expected systematic differences between the USNO magnitudes and the final SDSS magnitudes.\nSimilarly, Karaali et al. (2005) used observations obtained\nin u\u2032 g\u2032 r\u2032 filters at the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) at La\nPalma, Spain. These filters were designed to reproduce the\nSDSS system. These data were complemented by Landolt\n(1992) UBV standard star photometry and used to calculate transformations between the INT SDSS u\u2032 g\u2032 r\u2032 filterdetector combination and standard Johnson\u2013Cousins photometry. Karaali et al. (2005) presented for the first time transformation equations depending on two colors. Since the INT filters\nand detector differ from the actual filter-detector combinations\nused by the SDSS, again systematic deviations are to be expected.\nDirect empirical transformations between SDSS pointsource photometry from the \"early data release\" (EDR;\nStoughton et al. (2002)) and certain Johnson-Cousins filters\nwere calculated by Odenkirchen et al. (2001) and by Rave et al.\n(2003). Rave et al. (2003) based their transformations on resolved stellar photometry of the Draco dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy obtained with the SDSS as well as with various other\ntelescopes in different variants of the Johnson-Cousins system. The SDSS EDR photometry was then superseded by\nlater SDSS data releases (Abazajian et al. 2003, 2004, 2005;\nAdelman-McCarthy et al. 2006).\nA recent theoretical transformation was carried out by\nGirardi et al. (2004). These authors used the actual SDSS\n\nFig. 1. Comparison of the (normalized) filter curves of the\nJohnson-Cousins UBVRI passbands (upper panel, the SDSS\nugriz passbands (middle panel), and Becker's RGU photometry in the lower panel.\npassbands and CCD sensitivity curves of the SDSS camera\n(Gunn et al. 1998) employed at the 2.5-m SDSS telescope\nat Apache Point Observatory to transform theoretical stellar\nisochrones into the SDSS ugriz system.\nThe third photometric system that we are considering here\nis the RGU system by Becker (Becker 1946), a broad-band\nphotometric system that was initially introduced with the goal\nof measuring stellar parameters and Galactic structure. No earlier transformations between SDSS photometry and RGU photometry have been published. For transformation relations between RGU and UBV see Steinlin (1968a,b); Bell (1972);\nBuser (1978a,b). While RGU photometry is not widely used,\nit plays a continuing role due to the existence of the \"new\nBasel high-latitude field star survey\" (Buser & K\u00e4ser 1985;\nBuser et al. 1998). The goal of this single-epoch photographic\nsurvey is to map the Galactic density structure and the metallicity distribution in the various components of the Milky Way.\nFor this purpose, 14 intermediate and high-latitude fields were\nobserved, in which three-color RGU photometry of over 18 000\nstars was measured. The limiting magnitude of this Galactic\nsurvey is approximately G \u223c 19 or V \u223c 18. This survey\nmay seem to be obsolescent by modern standards due to its\nsmall number of stars, the shallow exposures, the limited photographic resolution, and the availability of much deeper, more\nhomogeneous, and much larger CCD surveys. On the other\nhand, this photographic survey has played an important role\nin uncovering the structure of our Galaxy (e.g., Buser et al.\n(1999)). Transformation relations between SDSS and RGU\n\n\fK. Jordi et al.: Empirical Color Transformations Between SDSS Photometry and Other Photometric Systems\n\nphotometry help to evaluate the earlier findings with respect\nto modern explorations of the structure of the Milky Way (e.g.,\nChen et al. (2001); Juric et al. (2005)). The Basel survey provides star counts (or space densities) also for distances relatively close to the Sun, whereas there is a gap at these distances in studies carried out using SDSS data due to the saturation limit at r \u223c 14. Space densities for stars with brighter\napparent magnitudes can be combined with Hipparchos parallaxes, thus providing reliable Galactic model parameters.\nMoreover, the metallicity sensitivity of the RGU system (e.g.,\nBuser & Fenkart (1990)) adds continuing value to the Basel\nhigh-latitude field star survey. Finally, this survey comprises\na number of important Galactic sight lines that are not included\nin the currently available wide-field CCD surveys, and the analysis of these sight lines is continuing.\nHere we present empirical color transformations between\nthe SDSS ugriz photometric system using point-source photometry obtained with the SDSS 2.5-m telescope at Apache\nPoint Observatory, and the Johnson-Cousins UBVRI system as\nwell as the RGU system, respectively. These empirical colors\nhave the advantage of not having to rely on synthetic colors or\non passband-detector combinations of other telescopes. Hence,\nthey provide the most direct transformations possible. In Sect.\n2 we present the sources of our star samples and the criteria\napplied to choose the stars. Section 3 contains our calculations\nand the resulting transformation equations. In Sect. 4 we discuss our results and some possible future developments.\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Data\nOur goal is to derive empirical transformations between the\nSDSS photometry as defined by the public SDSS data and the\ntwo other aforementioned photometric systems while minimizing the dependence on specific filter-detector combinations that\ndeviate from the generic ones. The data used for our transformations were taken from the four different sources described\nbelow.\nThe\nSDSS\ndata\nrelease\n4\n(SDSS\nDR4;\nAdelman-McCarthy et al. (2006)) comprises stellar pointsource magnitudes provided by the SDSS photometry pipelines\n(Lupton et al. 2001; Stoughton et al. 2002). This point-source\nphotometry is not expected to change anymore between DR4\nand later releases (e.g., Adelman-McCarthy et al. (2006)).\n\n2.1. Johnson-Cousins photometry\nFor Johnson-Cousins photometry the most generic standard\nstar database available that lends itself to a comparison is the\nsystem of standard stars set up by A. Landolt, in particular\nthe catalog published by Landolt (1992). This catalog contains\nan extensive set of mainly equatorial fields observed repeatedly with photoelectric aperture photometry. A number of the\nLandolt fields overlap with the area scanned by the SDSS. The\nLandolt photometry is widely used to transform and calibrate\nimaging data. The Landolt stars cover a V-magnitude range of\napproximately 11.5 to 16.0. With respect to SDSS photometry, the Landolt standard stars have one drawback: Many of\nthem are brighter than the saturation cutoff in the SDSS system\n\n(r \u2248 14). Nonetheless, the Landolt stars are valuable particularly for the transformation of the U-band photometry as we\nwill see later.\nThe problem of the reduced number of stars in common\nbetween the Landolt catalog and the SDSS due to saturation\nis alleviated by the extension of Landolt's standard stars to\nfainter magnitudes by Stetson (2000). Stetson used a large set\nof multi-epoch CCD observations centered on Landolt fields\nand other regions in the sky and reduced them in a homogeneous manner tied to the Landolt UBVRI system. The larger\narea coverage and greater sensitivity of the CCD observations\nas compared to the earlier photomultiplier observations permitted Stetson to include stars down to V \u2248 19 or 20. Since\n2000, Stetson has been publishing a gradually growing list\nof suitable faint stars (Stetson 2000) with repeat observations\nat the website of the Canadian Astronomy Data Center1 . The\nStetson catalog contains only stars that were observed at least\nfive times under photometric conditions and the standard error of the mean magnitude is less than 0.02 mag in at least\ntwo of the four filters. Stetson's data base also contains fields\nnot covered by Landolt, e.g., fields in globular clusters and in\nnearby resolved dwarf galaxies. While Landolt's original fields\ncontained mainly Population I stars, Stetson's new fields also\ninclude a sizable fraction of Population II stars.\nFor our work the Stetson fields published as of January\n2005 were used. As most of the SDSS DR4 sky coverage is\n1\n\nhttp://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/standards/\n\n\f4\n\nK. Jordi et al.: Empirical Color Transformations Between SDSS Photometry and Other Photometric Systems\n\nin the northern part of the sky, it was straightforward to select\nthose fields from the Stetson catalog that overlap with the SDSS\nDR4: 30 fields were identified and all stars available from the\nSDSS DR4 database within these fields were downloaded. For\nthe subsequent matching and calculation of transformation relations only SDSS stars with clean photometry were used. The\ncombination of flags describing the clean photometry can be\nfound on the SDSS DR4 webpage2. This flag combination excludes stars whose photometry may be questionable for a number of reasons, e.g., due to saturation, overlaps with other objects (blends), location at the edge of a frame, large errors in\nfitting a point spread function, etc.\nWe then matched the Stetson stars and the SDSS stars by\ntheir coordinates. The coordinates of the stars in DR4 are measured with an accuracy of less than 0.1\u2032\u2032 rms per coordinate\n(Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2006). In the Stetson catalog the coordinates are published with an accuracy of 0.15\u2032\u2032 for the right\nascension and 0.1\u2032\u2032 for the declination. Two stars \u2013 one from\neach sample \u2013 are considered\nequal if their angular separation\np\n\u2032\u2032\nis smaller than 0.5 : (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )2 cos(\u03b41 )2 + (\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 )2 \u2264 0.5\u2032\u2032 ,\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b4 stand for the right ascension and declination of\nthe stars in arcsec.\nAlthough the matching radius was chosen generously we\ndo not find a matching SDSS star for each Stetson star (see\nTable 1). The clean photometry rule removes between 30 and\n40 percent of our initial star sample. Furthermore, the SDSS\nphotometric pipeline only detects a reduced number of stars\nin crowded fields. This affects in particular fields in globular clusters such as NGC 2419, NGC 5272, NGC 5466, NGC\n7078, and NGC 7089, and fields with luminous extended galaxies such as NGC 2683. For fields with a very high degree of\ncrowding, no SDSS data are available since these fields were\nintentionally omitted during the pipeline reduction process.\nOwing to these limitations, our original number of 30 common\nfields is actually reduced to 23 fields in which common stars\nin Stetson's and the SDSS catalogs could be identified. Fields\nwithout any common stellar objects with clean photometry include regions centered on the galaxies M81, NGC 4526, and\nNGC 4736, on the globular clusters M5 and M13, and on fields\nwith stars that are all saturated in the SDSS like L114-750. In\nTable 1 the number of matches for each of the remaining 23\nfields is listed. In Fig. 2 we plot the R magnitude of Stetson stars\nagainst their photometric error and the r magnitude of SDSS\nstars against their photometric error in order to illustrate how\nmany stars we lose in the matching process. The Stetson stars\nare all brighter than 20th magnitude, but at the same time the\nbrightest SDSS stars with clean photometry are of 14th magnitude. Possible matches between stars in the Stetson and in the\nSDSS database will therefore lie within this magnitude interval\n(see dashed vertical lines in Fig. 2).\nSince Stetson's fields do not include U-band photometry in\nthe fields that overlap with the SDSS, we complemented the\nStetson data by standard stars from Landolt (Landolt 1992),\nour third data source. Only 54 stars from the Landolt catalog\noverlap with the DR4 sky coverage and have clean photometry\n2\n\nhttp://cas.sdss.org/astrodr4/en/help/docs/sql help.asp#clean\n\nFig. 2. For field L95 we plot the R magnitude of Stetson's standard stars (dark gray triangles) and the r magnitude of the\nSDSS stars (black crosses) against their photometric errors.\nThe light gray crosses are those SDSS stars with clean photometry. The vertical dashed lines indicate the magnitude intervall\nin which possible matches in field L95 will lie.\nin the SDSS, hence transformations involving U are necessarily\nbased on a small subsample of stars.\n\n2.2. Becker's RGU system\nOur fourth source of data is the \"new Basel high-latitude\nfield star survey\" (Buser & K\u00e4ser 1985; Buser et al. 1998). The\nfourteen fields of the Basel high-latitude field star survey are all\nspecified by a pair of galactic coordinates (Buser et al. 1998).\nThese coordinates are not consistently defined and do not necessarily mark the center of the field. In most of the fields, they\nmark one of the corners. Three fields completely overlap with\nthe SDSS DR4 sky coverage and six others have a partial overlap. The other five fields do not lie in the region of the sky\nthat the SDSS DR4 has scanned. For deriving transformations,\nthose two of the completely overlapping fields were used that\nhad the best photometric quality. Table 2 lists the two fields and\nthe number of found matches. The sample for the second set of\ntransformations contained a total of 775 stars.\nThe Basel survey does not list coordinates of the stars in its\nfields, so they were matched visually using the Basel finding\ncharts. In these prints of the photographic plates each measured\nstar is marked with its catalog number, making the identification of stars in common with the SDSS a rather tedious enterprise. Not for all Basel stars a matching partner was found. The\nSDSS CCD photometry has higher resolution than the photographic plates of the Basel survey. In some cases, the SDSS\nrecognized an object as a galaxy, whereas in the Basel survey\n\n\fK.

In other cases, there was simply no star\nin the SDSS where Basel detected one. Occasionally the SDSS\ndetected a fainter object within a radius of 1\u2032\u2032 to 3\u2032\u2032 of the dominant star, whereas in the Basel catalog only one source was\ndetected. In all those cases these stars were deleted from our\nsample in order to ensure that only reliable photographic photometry was included. Moreover, we only used SDSS sources\nwith clean photometry.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Transformations between SDSS and\nJohnson\u2013Cousins Photometry\nThe transformation between the Johnson\u2013Cousins UBVRI photometry system and the SDSS ugriz system was carried out using the following eight general equations:\ng \u2212 V = a1 (B \u2212 V) + b1\n\n(1)\n\nr \u2212 i = a2 (R \u2212 I) + b2\nr \u2212 z = a3 (R \u2212 I) + b3\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nr \u2212 R = a4 (V \u2212 R) + b4\nu \u2212 g = a5 (U \u2212 B) + b5 (B \u2212 V) + c5\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\ng \u2212 B = a6 (B \u2212 V) + b6\ng \u2212 r = a7 (V \u2212 R) + b7\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\ni \u2212 I = a8 (R \u2212 I) + b8\n\n(8)\n\nNot for all of the standard stars in Stetson's catalog measurements in all four bands (BVRI) are available, hence the\nnumber of stars used differed somewhat depending on the filters used in the transformation equation. We calculate in all but\none case transformations depending on one color only. For the\nu \u2212 g equation two colors are used since the SDSS g passband\noverlaps with the Johnson B and V passband, so a dependence\non (B \u2212 V) can be expected, and more importantly, the variation\nin position of the stellar locus owing to temperature, surface\ngravity, and metallicity is particularly large in this wavelength\nrange (e.g., Grebel & Roberts (1995); Lenz et al. (1998)).\n\n3.1.1. 'Global' transformations between UBVRI and\nugriz\nIn Fig. 3 the colors specified on the left-hand side and on\nthe right-hand side of our transformation equations are plotted\nagainst each other for all the stars used in each of the transformations. The resulting linear relations are plotted as solid lines.\n\n5\n\nWith the exception of the (r \u2212 R),(V \u2212 R) transformation (equation 4), which exhibits a pronounced slope change (see also\nFukugita et al. (1996)), the relations are linear to first order. In\nTable 3 the resulting coefficients for the 'global' transformations are listed.\nHere 'global' means that the entire star sample described\nabove was used for the calculation without differentiating between potential Population I and Population II stars. The coefficients were calculated using least-squares minimization. The\nindividual stars are weighted according to their formal photometric error. In Fig. 4 the deviations between the measured and\nthe calculated magnitudes and colors are shown. The deviations\nget bigger for fainter magnitudes.\n\n3.1.2. Metallicity-dependent transformations between\nBVRI and griz\nThe influence of metallicity on the transformation was investigated to the extent possible with the available standard\nstar fields. One of the Stetson fields covers part of the Draco\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy. The majority of the stars from this\nMilky Way companion has a very low metallicity: Draco's\nmean metallicity is [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122.0 dex (Grebel et al. 2003).\nMoreover, Stetson and the SDSS provide photometry for\nthe surroundings of the similarly metal-poor globular clusters NGC 2419 (\u22122.12 dex according to Harris (1996)) and\nNGC 7078 (\u22122.26 dex; Harris (1996)). Probable member stars\nof these three objects were selected based on their colormagnitude diagrams. This provides us with a metal-poor sample of ancient Population II stars. We may assume that the ages\nof the three old objects are comparable within the measurement\naccuracy (see also Grebel & Gallagher (2004)).\nIn contrast, the metallicity of the stars in Landolt's equatorial fields is not known. We may assume that many of them belong to the Galactic disk, that Population I stars dominate, and\nthat they have a range of metallicities. Presumably the metallicity of these stars is comparatively high and may reach values up\nto solar. Our old, metal-poor Population II subsample and our\nmore metal-rich Population I subsample allow us to empirically\nassess a possible impact of metallicity on photometric transformations. Here our calculations involve only BVRI (equations 1\nto 4 and 6 to 8). For equation 5, a distinction between metalpoor and metal-rich stars was not possible because of the lack\nof U-band photometry. This is unfortunate since colors including U or u are particularly sensitive to stellar parameters including metallicity (see, e.g., Grebel & Roberts (1995); Lenz et al.\n(1998); Helmi et al. (2003)).\nIn Table 4 the resulting equations are listed. The resulting\nlinear relations are plotted in Fig. 5. While the metal-rich stars\nare distributed fairly evenly across a wide range of colors, the\nmetal-poor stars are concentrated within a fairly small range\nof colors corresponding mainly to the locus of the red giant\nbranch. There are no metal-poor stars in our Population II sample with colors redder than (V \u2212 R) = 0.93. In the diagrams\nincluding (R \u2212 I) the locus of the Population I stars is shifted\ntowards somewhat bluer (r \u2212i) and (r \u2212z) colors as compared to\nthe Population II stars.

At the main stellar\nlocus, these deviations are less than the observed scatter in the\ncolors of the stars in the two samples. Owing to the large scatter in the (r \u2212 R),(V \u2212 R) and (i \u2212 I),(R \u2212 I) diagrams, little can\nbe said about possible trends here.\n\n3.1.3. Comparison between our transformations and\nearlier work\nWe compared our 'global' transformations with transformations published by Fukugita et al. (1996), Smith et al. (2002)\nand Karaali et al. (2005). Fukugita et al. (1996) used synthetic magnitudes from the spectrophotometric atlases of\nGunn & Stryker (1983) and of Oke (1990) for their transformations. Smith et al. (2002) presented transformations based\non actually measured magnitudes of 158 SDSS standard stars.\nTheir measurements were not done with the 2.5-m SDSS\ntelescope, but with the 1.0-m telescope at the US Naval\nObservatory, Flagstaff Station. Karaali et al. (2005) were the\nfirst to do transformations depending on two colors. For their\ntransformations they used 251 stars of Landolt (1992) for the\nUBV data and data from the CASU INT Wide Field Survey\nmeasured in filters close to the SDSS ugr passbands. In Fig. 6\nthe color-color plots show our transformation relations, which\nare based directly on the 2.5-m SDSS data, in comparison with\nthe previously published transformations listed above.\nAs Fig. 6 demonstrates, for the (B \u2212 V) transformation (upper left panel and equation 1) the earlier transformations lie\nbelow our star distribution and have a slightly different slope.\nFor the (R \u2212 I) transformation in equation 2 (upper right panel)\nour data do not support a change of slope for red colors as suggested in the previous studies. The distribution gets broader for\nR \u2212 I > 1.15, and the Fukugita et al. (1996) and Smith et al.\n(2002) transformations represent the upper half of the distribution whereas our fit reproduces the average of the stellar locus.\nFor equation 3 (lower left panel) the earlier studies and our\nwork show close agreement. Transformations for (u \u2212 g) (equation 5) were calculated by Smith et al. (2002), Karaali et al.\n(2005), and by us. Smith et al.'s equation differs from the others\nbecause it only depends on one color. The lower right diagram\nin Fig. 6 shows the deviation between the measured (u\u2212g) color\nand the calculated (u \u2212 g) color. The one-color transformations\nby Smith et al. do not reproduce the colors of the combined\nLandolt and Stetson samples very well.

Transformations between SDSS and RGU\nPhotometry\nFor the transformation between the RGU system and the SDSS\nugriz system we defined the following three equations:\nU \u2212 G = a1 (u \u2212 g) + b1\n\n(9)\n\nG \u2212 R = a2 (g \u2212 r) + b2\nG = a3 g + b3\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nThe stars of our SDSS\u2013RGU sample show a relatively large\nscatter in the color planes. One of the reasons for the scatter\nis the lower photometric accuracy of the photographic data as\ncompared to modern CCD data, namely typical internal uncertainties of \u03c3G = 0.05, \u03c3G\u2212R = 0.07, and \u03c3U\u2212G = 0.08\n(Buser et al. 1998). Some of our 775 common stars lie far off\nthe broad, mean stellar loci. Since the resolution of the photographic data is relatively low, these deviant points are most\nlikely false matches or blends in the photographic photometry.\nWe thus removed them from our sample before we calculated\nthe transformation relations. For this set of transformations we\nused the same procedure as before. The coefficients are listed\nin Table 5.\nIn Fig. 7 in the upper three panels the distribution of the\nstars in the color planes is shown, and the calculated transformations are plotted as straight lines. Given the larger scatter,\nit is not surprising that the uncertainties of the coefficients are\nnow larger than for the UBVRI transformations. Moreover, the\nstellar data exhibit some wiggles, which we attribute to a nonlinear response of the photographic plates used in the Basel survey. Especially for the (u \u2212 g) transformation the nonlinearity\nappears to be a problem. We investigated whether we could improve the transformation relations by making them dependent\non two color terms instead of one, but this yielded no noticeable\nimprovement.\n\n4. Discussion\nWe presented empirical color transformations for the conversion of the SDSS ugriz photometric system into the JohnsonCousins UBVRI system and into Becker's RGU system, respectively. These are the first transformations between the SDSS\n\n\fK. Jordi et al.: Empirical Color Transformations Between SDSS Photometry and Other Photometric Systems\n\n7\n\nFig. 3. The 'global' transformations between UBVRI and ugriz. The solid black line is the best-fit relation. Its coefficients are\nlisted in Table 3.\nand the Becker system, whereas several earlier transformations between variants of the SDSS and of the Johnson-Cousins\nsystem have been published. For the Johnson-Cousins conversions, the novelty of our approach lies in the use of actual SDSS\ndata obtained with the 2.5-m SDSS telescope at Apache Point\nObservatory and the use of well-defined Johnson-Cousins standard stars taken from the lists of Landolt (1992) and Stetson\n(2000). For all transformations linear relations were found to\nbe sufficient, with a slope change in transformations involving\n(V \u2212 R).\nA comparison with previously published transformations\nshows that they qualitatively reproduce our transformations,\nbut that they show systematic differences that may amount to\n\u223c 0.1 mag. This is due to the fact that the earlier transformations were either done with data that used other filter\u2013detector\u2013\ntelescope combinations than that of the actual 2.5-m SDSS telescope and therefore differ intrinsically from the actual SDSS\n\ndata, or that the data are based on early versions of the SDSS\nphotometry catalogs before the SDSS photometry was in its final form, or that non-standard Johnson-Cousins data were used.\nFor conversions between the SDSS and the JohnsonCousins systems, we tested the transformations for a possible\nmetallicity dependence. Some of the Stetson standard stars lie\nin a field centered on the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy or on\nmetal-poor (\u223c \u22122.0 dex) globular clusters. Most of the stars\nin these fields are Population II stars and have much lower\nmetallicities than the majority of the stars in Landolt's equatorial standard fields, where Population I stars dominate. The\nlatter sample necessarily comprises stars with a range of ages\nand abundances, while our Population II sample is essentially\nlimited to very old and very metal-poor stars. The calculated\ncoefficients for the metal-poor stars result in slightly different\nslopes as compared to the more metal-rich stars, which affect\nvery blue and very red stars most. Although our metallicity\n\n\f8\n\nK. Jordi et al.: Empirical Color Transformations Between SDSS Photometry and Other Photometric Systems\n\nFig. 4.
