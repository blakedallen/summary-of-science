Entanglement also reveals a fundamental difference between the quantum and\nclassical world which may be detected by Bell inequallity and other means [4]. In spite of these striking facts, it is a\nhard problem to decide whether a given quantum state is entangled [18].\nA non-entangled state, also known as a separable state, is by definition a convex sum of product states [37]. For a\nbipartite state \u03c1 acting on the Hilbert space H\nP:= HA \u2297 HB , the partial transpose computed in an orthonormal (o.n.)\nbasis {|ai i} of system A, is defined by \u03c1\u0393 = ij |aj ihai | \u2297 hai |\u03c1|aj i. The dimensions of HA and HB are denoted by\nM and N , respectively. (We assume that M, N \u2265 2.) We say that \u03c1 is a k \u00d7 l state if its local ranks are k and l, i.e.,\nrank \u03c1A = k and rank \u03c1B = l. We say that \u03c1 is a PPT [NPT] state if \u03c1\u0393 \u2265 0 [\u03c1\u0393 has at least one negative eigenvalue].\nEvidently, a separable state must be PPT. The converse is true only if M N \u2264 6 [24, 33]. The first examples of\ntwo-qutrit PPT entangled states (PPTES) were constructed (in purely mathematical context) by Choi and St\u00f8rmer\nin the 1980s [12, 36]. They were introduced in 1997 [25] into quantum information theory. The Choi's example has\nbeen generalized in [19]. The PPTES can be used for many tasks, e.g. the extraction of distillable key [23].\nA systematic method of constructing two-qutrit PPTES \u03c1 of rank four was proposed in 1999 [3] by using the\nunextendible product bases (UPB). This construction is indeed universal: it was proved in 2011 [9, 35] that any\nsuch \u03c1 can be constructed by using a UPB. Any such \u03c1 can be converted by stochastic local operations and classical\ncommunications (SLOCC) into a canonical form depending on for positive parameters, see Eq. (7) and the subsequent\nparagraph. This canonical form is a minor modification of the one constructed in [9, Eq. (108)]. We demonstrate\nour result by using the well-known Pyramid and Tiles UPB [14]. The set of SLOCC equivalence classes of two-qutrit\nPPTES carries the natural quotient topology. We show that this topological space is homeomorphic to the quotient\nof the open rectangular box R \u2282 R4 by an action of the alternating group A5 . The checkerboard family of PPTES is\nan early well-known example of an infinite family of two-qutrit PPTES of rank four [6]. We show that, under SLOCC,\nthe checkerboard PPTES can be parametrized by only two real parameters. These results clarify the structure of\n3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four.\nWe say that a PPT state \u03c1 is extreme if it is an extreme point of the compact convex set of all normalized PPT states.\nEvery PPT state is a convex linear combination of extreme states. For convenience we say that a non-normalized\nstate is extreme if its normalization is extreme.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: cqtcl@nus.edu.sg (Corresponding \u0303Author)\n\n\f2\nWe say that a PPT state \u03c1 is an edge state if there is no product vector |a, bi \u2208 R(\u03c1) such that |a\u2217 , bi \u2208 R(\u03c1\u0393 ).\nThus an edge state must be a PPTES. It is easy to see that any entangled extreme state is an edge state, but the\nconverse is false. It has been proved that any 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four is an extreme state [9]. They are PPTES\nof lowest rank. Both extreme and edge states in higher dimensions have been extensively studied in recent years\n[9, 11, 30, 35]. Among them, 3 \u00d7 3 extreme and edge states have the simplest structure. We will give a summary of\nthe recent progress on these states, and point out some unknown cases. We explicitly construct states for these cases,\nincluding extreme PPTES of birank (5, 6) and (5, 7), as well as non-extreme edge states of birank (6, 6), (5, 6) and\n(5, 7). (We refer to the ordered pair (rank \u03c1, rank \u03c1\u0393 ) as the birank of \u03c1.)\nThe content of our paper is as follows. In Sec. II we provide the technical tools used in the paper. In Sec. III\nwe consider the set E \u2032 of 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four, which is invariant under the natural action of the group G of\nlocal invertible transformations. In Theorem 7 we prove that any \u03c1 \u2208 E \u2032 can be converted under SLOCC into the\ncanonical form. We also prove, see Theorem 9, that the quotient spaces E \u2032 /G and R/A5 mentioned in the abstract are\nhomeomorphic. In Sec. IV, we construct a family of checkerboard PPTES depending on two positive parameters u\nand v, see Proposition 14. We show that any checkerboard PPTES is SLOCC equivalent to a member of this family.\nBy using invariants, we find a simple characterization of checkerboard PPTES (see Proposition 15). In Sec. V we\nsummarize the recent progress on 3 \u00d7 3 extreme and edge states. We examine some of the known states of this type\nto find out what other properties they may have. E.g. we observe that there exist extreme states of birank (r, s) with\nr 6= s. Apparently, this observation is new. The results are presented in Table I at the end of this section. We also\npropose several open problems.\nII.\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n\nWe shall write Ik for the identity k \u00d7 k matrix. We denote by R(\u03c1) and ker \u03c1 the range and kernel of a linear\nmap \u03c1, respectively. From now on, unless stated otherwise, the states will not be normalized. We shall denote by\n{|iiA : i = 0, . . . , M \u2212 1} and {|jiB : j = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1} o.n. bases of HA and HB , respectively. The subscripts A and\nB will be often omitted. Any state \u03c1 of rank r can be represented as\n\u03c1=\n\nM\u22121\nX\n\ni,j=0\n\n|iihj| \u2297 Ci\u2020 Cj ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the Ci are R \u00d7 N matrices and R is an arbitrary integer \u2265 r. In particular, one can take R = r. We shall often\nconsider \u03c1 as a block matrix \u03c1 = C \u2020 C = [Ci\u2020 Cj ], where C = [C0 C1 * * * CM\u22121 ] is an R \u00d7 M N matrix. Thus Ci\u2020 Cj is\nthe matrix of the linear operator hi|A \u03c1|jiA acting on HB .\nIn physics, the density matrix \u03c1 describes the systems AB. In many cases we only need to describe one system by\nthe reduced density matrices \u03c1A = TrB \u03c1 and \u03c1B = TrA \u03c1. For these matrices, using Eq. (1) we have the formulae\n\u03c1B =\n\nM\u22121\nX\n\nCi\u2020 Ci ;\n\n\u03c1A = [Tr Ci\u2020 Cj ],\n\ni=0\n\ni, j = 0, . . . , M \u2212 1.\n\nIt is easy to verify that the range of \u03c1 is the column space of the matrix C \u2020 and that\n)\n(M\u22121\nM\u22121\nX\nX\nCi |yi i = 0 .\n|ii \u2297 |yi i :\nker \u03c1 =\ni=0\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\ni=0\n\nIn particular, if Ci |ji = 0 for some i and j then |i, ji \u2208 ker \u03c1.\nFor any bipartite state \u03c1 we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c1\u0393 B = TrA \u03c1\u0393 = TrA \u03c1 = \u03c1B ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c1\u0393 A = TrB \u03c1\u0393 = (TrB \u03c1)T = (\u03c1A )T .\n(The exponent T denotes transposition.) Consequently,\n\u0001\nrank \u03c1\u0393 A,B = rank \u03c1A,B .\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nIf \u03c1 is an M \u00d7 N PPT state, then \u03c1\u0393 is too. If \u03c1 is a PPTES so is \u03c1\u0393 , but they may have different ranks.\nLet us now recall some basic results from quantum information regarding the separability and PPT properties of\nbipartite states. Let us start with the basic definition.\n\n\f3\nDefinition 1 We say that two bipartite states \u03c1 and \u03c3 are equivalent under stochastic local operations and classical\ncommunications (SLOCC-equivalent, or just equivalent) if there exists an invertible local operator (ILO) V = VA \u2297VB\nsuch that V \u03c1V \u2020 = \u03c3 [16].\nThis is the physical realization of ILO. Thus the equivalence classes of states are just the orbits under the action of\nthe group G := GL3 (C) \u00d7 GL3 (C). It is easy to see that any ILO transforms PPT, entangled, or separable state into\nthe same kind of state. We shall often use ILOs to simplify the density matrices of states.\nLet us recall from [8, Theorem 22] and [9, Theorems 17,22] the main facts about the 3 \u00d7 3 PPT states of rank four.\nLet M = N = 3 and let U denote the set of unextendible product bases in H. For {\u03c8} \u2208 U we denote by \u03a0{\u03c8} the\nnormalized state (1/4)P , where P is the orthogonal projector onto {\u03c8}\u22a5 . We say that a subspace of H is completely\nentangled (CES) if it contains no product vectors. (We require product vectors to be nonzero.) For counting purposes\nwe do not distinguish product vectors which are scalar multiples of each other.\nWe give a formal definition of the term \"general position\" [11, Definition 7].\nDefinition 2 We say that a family of product vectors {|\u03c8i i = |\u03c6i i \u2297 |\u03c7i i : i \u2208 I} is in general position (in H) if for\nany J \u2286 I with |J| \u2264 M the vectors |\u03c6j i, j \u2208 J, are linearly independent and for any K \u2286 I with |K| \u2264 N the vectors\n|\u03c7k i, k \u2208 K, are linearly independent.\nTheorem 3 (M = N = 3) For a 3 \u00d7 3 PPT state \u03c1 of rank four, the following assertions hold.\n(i) \u03c1 is entangled if and only if R(\u03c1) is a CES.\n(ii) If \u03c1 is separable, then it is either the sum of four pure product states or the sum of a pure product state and a\n2 \u00d7 2 separable state of rank three.\n(iii) If \u03c1 is entangled, then\n(a) \u03c1 is extreme;\n(b) rank \u03c1\u0393 = 4;\n(c) \u03c1 = V \u03a0{\u03c8} V \u2020 for some V \u2208 G and some {\u03c8} \u2208 U;\n(d) ker \u03c1 contains exactly 6 product vectors, and these vectors are in general position.\nThe first assertion of the following proposition is [9, Theorem 23].\nProposition 4 (M = N = 3) Any \u03c1 \u2208 E \u2032 is SLOCC equivalent to one which is invariant under partial transpose,\ni.e., there exist A, B \u2208 GL3 (C) such that \u03c3 := A \u2297 B \u03c1 A\u2020 \u2297 B \u2020 satisfies the equality \u03c3 \u0393 = \u03c3. Moreover, we may\nassume that \u03c3 = C \u2020 C where C = [C0 C1 C2 ] and\n0\n\uf8ef0\nC0 = \uf8f0\n0\n0\n\uf8ee\n\na\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f9\nb\n1\uf8fa\n,\n0\uf8fb\n0\n\n0\n\uf8ef0\nC1 = \uf8f0\n0\n1\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n0 0\n0\nc \uf8fa\n,\n0 1 \uf8fb\n0 \u22121/d\n\n\uf8f9\n0 \u22121/b 0\n\uf8ef0 1 0\uf8fa\n;\nC2 = \uf8f0\n1 \u2212c 0 \uf8fb\nd 0 0\n\uf8ee\n\na, b, c, d > 0.\n\n(7)\n\nThe weaker form of the second assertion, with a being just real and nonzero, follows from the proof of [9, Theorem\n23] and [10]. The stronger claim that (like b, c, d) a can also be chosen to be positive will be proved in Theorem 7.\nFor convenience, we say that any state \u03c3 = C \u2020 C, where C is defined as in this proposition with a, b, c, d > 0, is in the\ncanonical form.\nAs an application, let us recall the following result [9, Theorem 24].\nProposition 5 (M = N = 3) If the normalized states \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 are 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four with the same range,\nthen \u03c1 = \u03c1\u2032 .\nIII.\n\nEQUIVALENCE CLASSES OF 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES OF RANK FOUR\n\nThe main objective of this section is to show that the set of equivalence classes of 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four,\nequipped with the quotient topology, is homeomorphic to the quotient R/A5 where R \u2282 R4 is a product of four open\nintervals and A5 is the alternating group of order 60 acting on R by rational transformations. We also formulate a\ntest for checking the equivalence of two 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four.\nRecall that E \u2032 is the set of 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four, and that E \u2032 is G-invariant. The quotient space E \u2032 /G\nparametrizes the set of equivalence classes of 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four. We equip E \u2032 /G with the quotient topology\nand let \u03c0 : E \u2032 \u2192 E \u2032 /G be the projection map.\n\n\f4\nLet \u03a9 = {(a, b, c, d) : a, b, c, d > 0} be the positive orthant of R4 . Define the map \u03c9 : \u03a9 \u2192 E \u2032 by the formula\n\u03c9(a, b, c, d) = C \u2020 C, where C = [C0 C1 C2 ] and the blocks Ci are 4 \u00d7 3 matrices given by Eq. (7). Our first objective is\nto prove that the map \u03c0\u03c9 : \u03a9 \u2192 E \u2032 /G is onto. This was proved in our previous paper [9] apart from the fact that the\nsign of the parameter a was left ambiguous. The proof uses the G-invariants of quintuples of product vectors which\nwe now briefly recall.\nLet (|\u03b1i i)4i=0 be an (ordered) quintuple of vectors in HA such that any three of them are linearly independent. To\nany such quintuple we assign three invariants (J1A , J2A , J3A ). These are certain complex numbers, different from 0 and\n1, subject to the relation J1A J2A J3A = 1. They are defined by the formulae\nJ1A =\n\n\u22062,0,4 \u22060,1,3\n,\n\u22062,0,3 \u22060,1,4\n\nJ2A =\n\n\u22060,1,4 \u22061,2,3\n,\n\u22060,1,3 \u22061,2,4\n\nJ3A =\n\n\u22061,2,4 \u22062,0,3\n,\n\u22061,2,3 \u22062,0,4\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u2206i,j,k = det[|\u03b1i i |\u03b1j i |\u03b1k i]. If two quintuples, say (|\u03b1i i) and (|\u03b1\u2032i i), have the same invariants then there exists\nan invertible linear operator VA on HA such that VA |\u03b1i i \u221d |\u03b1\u2032i i for each index i. (The proportionality constants may\ndepend on the index.) The converse is also valid.\nTo any quintuple of product vectors (|\u03c6i i = |\u03b1i , \u03b2i i)4i=0 in H, which are in general position, we assign six invariants\n(J1A , J2A , J3A , J1B , J2B , J3B ), where the (J1A , J2A , J3A ) are the invariants of the quintuple (|\u03b1i i) and (J1B , J2B , J3B ) are those\nof the quintuple (|\u03b2i i). If two quintuples of product vectors, say (|\u03c6i i) and (|\u03c8i i), have the same invariants then there\nexists an ILO, say V , such that V |\u03c6i i \u221d |\u03c8i i for each index i, and the converse holds.\nFor \u03c1 \u2208 E \u2032 , ker \u03c1 contains exactly six product vectors, say |\u03c6i i, i = 0, . . . , 5. Moreover, these six product vectors\nare in general position, see [9, Theorem 22]. There are in total 720 different sextuples (|\u03c6\u03c0i i), where \u03c0 \u2208 S6 is a\npermutation of the set {0, 1, . . . , 5}. We define the six invariants of such sextuple to be the invariants of the quintuple\nwhich is obtained from the sextuple by truncation, i.e., by omitting the last product vector |\u03c6\u03c05 i. It follows from\n[9, Theorem 25] that, for all sextuples (|\u03c6\u03c0i i), all six invariants are real. Hence, each of the invariants belongs to\none of the open intervals p = (0, 1), P = (1, +\u221e) and N = (\u2212\u221e, 0). To each of the sextuples we associate a six\nletter symbol, with letters chosen from the set {p, P, N }. The symbol is constructed from the sequence of invariants\n(J1A , J2A , J3A , J1B , J2B , J3B ) by replacing each number by the letter designating the open interval p, P, N containing it.\nIn the generic case, the 720 sextuples of product vectors will have pairwise different sextuples of invariants. However,\nonly 12 different symbols arise. We refer to these particular symbols as the UPB symbols (see [9, Table I]. Each of\nthe 12 UPB symbols arises exactly 60 times. For convenience we single out one of the 12 UPB symbols, namely the\nsymbol ppPNNp.\nWe assume (as we may) that the chosen sextuple (|\u03c6i i) is of type ppPNNp. The set of all permutations \u03c0 \u2208 S6 for\nwhich (|\u03c6\u03c0i i) is of type ppPNNp is a subgroup of S6 isomorphic to the alternating group A5 of order 60. We shall\nrefer to this subgroup as the stabilizer of the symbol ppPNNp. One defines similarly the stabilizers for other UPB\nsymbols. All these stabilizers are isomorphic to A5 and are pairwise distinct. For the symbol ppPNNp, the stabilizer\nis generated by the 5-cycle \u03b1 = (0, 1, 2, 3, 5) and the involution \u03b2 = (1, 2)(4, 5). Note that it permutes transitively the\nsix product vectors |\u03c6i i. From now on we set A5 = h\u03b1, \u03b2i.\nSince J1A J2A J3A = 1 and J1B J2B J3B = 1, it suffices to work with the following four invariants J1A , J2A , J2B , J3B . For\neach \u03c0 \u2208 A5 , the sextuple (|\u03c6\u03c0i i) has symbol ppPNNp and so the quadruple of its invariants (J1A , J2A , J2B , J3B ) belongs\nto the open infinite rectangular box R = p \u00d7 p \u00d7 N \u00d7 p (a product of four open intervals in the Euclidean space\nR4 ). We shall see that R parametrizes the set of equivalence classes of 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES \u03c1 of rank four. However, this\nparametrization is not one-to-one; generically it is sixty-to-one. The action of A5 on sextuples of product vectors\nin ker \u03c1 induces an action of A5 on R, and the equivalence classes are represented by the orbits of A5 in R. Let us\ndescribe explicitly the action of \u03b1 and \u03b2 on the quadruple of invariants (a, b, c, d) := (J1A , J2A , J2B , J3B ):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(1 \u2212 c)(1 \u2212 acd)\n1 (1 \u2212 b)(1 \u2212 acd) (1 \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 abd)\n(1 \u2212 d)(b \u2212 c)\n;\n(9)\n\u03b1 : (a, b, c, d) \u2192\n, b*\n, \u2212 *\n,\n(1 \u2212 c)(1 \u2212 abd)\n(1 \u2212 cd)(b \u2212 c)\nd (1 \u2212 a)(b \u2212 c)\n(1 \u2212 ab)(1 \u2212 acd)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\u2212c\n(1 \u2212 ab) \u2212 ce\nb\n(1 \u2212 ab) \u2212 ce\n(1 \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 abd)\n\u03b2 : (a, b, c, d) \u2192 d *\n,\n(10)\n,\n, *\n, \u2212c*\n1 \u2212 cd (1 \u2212 c)(1 \u2212 abd) c (1 \u2212 b)(1 \u2212 abd)\n(1 \u2212 ab) \u2212 ce\nwhere e = (1 \u2212 a) + ad(1 \u2212 b). The meaning of, say, the first formula is that its right hand member is the quadruple\nof invariants of the sextuple (|\u03c6\u03b1i i) = (|\u03c65 i, |\u03c60 i, |\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i, |\u03c64 i, |\u03c63 i).\nFrom the preceding discussion we obtain the following test for equivalence.\nTheorem 6 Let \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 \u2208 E \u2032 and let (|\u03c6i i) and (|\u03c6\u2032i i) be sextuples of product vectors in ker \u03c1 and ker \u03c1\u2032 , respectively.\nThen \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 are SLOCC equivalent if and only if there exists a permutation \u03c0 \u2208 S6 such that the sextuples (|\u03c6\u03c0i i)\nand (|\u03c6\u2032i i) have the same invariants.\n\n\f5\nProof. Necessity. Let \u03c1\u2032 = V \u03c1V \u2020 , where V is an ILO. Since \u03c1|\u03c6i i = 0 and ker \u03c1 = V \u2020 ker \u03c1\u2032 , we have V \u2020 |\u03c6\u2032i i = ci |\u03c6\u03c0i i\nfor some permutation \u03c0 and some nonzero scalars ci . It follows that the sextuples (|\u03c6\u03c0i i) and (|\u03c6\u2032i i) have the same\ninvariants.\nSufficiency. Since (|\u03c6\u03c0i i) and (|\u03c6\u2032i i) have the same invariants, there exists an ILO, say V , such that V \u2020 |\u03c6\u2032i i = ci |\u03c6\u03c0i i\nfor some permutation \u03c0 and some nonzero scalars ci . Since the |\u03c6\u2032i i span ker \u03c1\u2032 and the |\u03c6i i span ker \u03c1, we have\nV \u2020 ker \u03c1\u2032 = ker \u03c1 = V \u2020 ker(V \u03c1V \u2020 ). It follows that the states \u03c1 and V \u03c1V \u2020 have the same kernel and range. By\nProposition 5 these two states are equivalent, and so are \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 .\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe shall now prove that each point of R is the quadruple of invariants of some \u03c1 \u2208 E \u2032 and that we can indeed\nrequire in Proposition 4 that a > 0. In view of Theorem 6 this implies that the map \u03c0\u03c9 : \u03a9 \u2192 E \u2032 /G is onto.\nTheorem 7 Every \u03c3 \u2208 E \u2032 is SLOCC equivalent to a state \u03c1 = \u03c9(a, b, c, d) (where all a, b, c, d > 0). For each point\n(x, y, z, w) \u2208 R there exists a state \u03c1 \u2208 E \u2032 such that (x, y, z, w) = (J1A , J2A , J2B , J3B ) for some sextuple of product vectors\nin ker \u03c1.\nProof. To prove the first assertion we choose a sextuple of product vectors (|\u03c6i i)5i=0 in ker \u03c3 with invariants of type\nppP N N p. Thus we have (J1A , J2A , J2B , J3B ) \u2208 R. Let us define the positive numbers b, c, d by\nb2 = \u2212\nc2 = \u2212\n\n(1 \u2212 J2A )(1 \u2212 J1A J2A )\nJ2B J3B\n,\n*\nA\nJ2\n(1 \u2212 J2B J3B )(1 \u2212 J1A J2B J3B )\n1 (1 \u2212 J1A J2B )(J2A \u2212 J2B J3B )\n,\n*\nJ2B\n(1 \u2212 J3B )(1 \u2212 J1A J2A )\n\nd2 = J1A *\n\n(1 \u2212 J2B )(1 \u2212 J3B )\n.\n(1 \u2212 J1A )(1 \u2212 J1A J2B J3B )\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\n(It is easy to see that the right hand sides are positive.)\nWe can now define a > 0 by the formula\na =\n\nbcd (1 \u2212 J1A )(1 \u2212 J1A J2B J3B )(J2A \u2212 J2B J3B )\n*\n.\nJ3B\n(1 \u2212 J2A )(1 \u2212 J1A J2B )2\n\n(14)\n\nWe claim that \u03c1 := \u03c9(a, b, c, d) and \u03c3 are equivalent. It suffices to show that we can choose a sextuple of product\nvectors in ker \u03c1 having the same invariants as the sextuple (|\u03c6i i). We observe that ker \u03c1 contains the product vectors\n|iii for i = 0, 1, 2. We have to find the remaining three product vectors in this kernel. We proceed as in the proof of\n[9, Theorem 25]. We introduce the cubic polynomial\nf (z) = abz(cz \u2212 1 \u2212 d2 )(c \u2212 (1 + c2 )z) + d(cz \u2212 1)(b2 c \u2212 (1 + b2 + b2 c2 )z).\n\n(15)\n\nIt has three real roots z1 , z2 , z3 such that\nz3 < 0,\n\n\u03bb < z1 < c/(1 + c2 ),\n\n1/c < z2 < (1 + d2 )/c,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03bb = b2 c/(1 + b2 + b2 c2 ). Explicitly, they are given by the formulae\nz1 =\nz2 =\n\nJ3B\n1 \u2212 J1A J2B\n*\n,\nc (1 \u2212 J1A J2B J3B )\n1 \u2212 J1A J2B\n1\n*\n,\nc (1 \u2212 J1A J2B J3B )\n\n1 (1 \u2212 J2A )(1 \u2212 J1A J2B )\n.\nz3 = \u2212 *\nc (1 \u2212 J1A )(J2A \u2212 J2B )\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n\n[The verification that these are indeed the roots of f (z) is a very tedious job if done by hand, but it is trivial for a\npackage for symbolic algebraic computations such as Maple.]\nThe three additional product vectors in the kernel of \u03c1 are |\u03c8i i (i = 1, 2, 3) defined by [9, Eq. (110)]. By using\nthe above expressions for a, b, c, d and z1 , z2 , z3 and the formulae [9, Eqs. (119-120)], we can compute the invariants\nof the sextuple (|00i, |11i, |22i, |\u03c81i, |\u03c82 i, |\u03c83 i). We obtain that they are the same as the invariants of the sextuple\n(|\u03c6i i). This proves our claim and completes the proof of the first assertion.\nTo prove the second assertion, let us define a smooth map \u03a6 : R \u2192 \u03a9. We set \u03a6(x, y, z, w) = (a, b, c, d), where\na, b, c, d are defined by the formulae (11)-(14) in which we replace J1A , J2A , J2B , J3B with x, y, z, w, respectively. The proof\n\n\f6\nof the first assertion shows that the quadruple of invariants of the state \u03c1, constructed above, is exactly (x, y, z, w).\nHence, the second assertion is proved.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nIt is not hard to show that the above map \u03a6 is a local diffeomorphism. We believe that it is a (global) diffeomorphism,\nbut this question is beyond the scope of this paper. However, let us observe that if (x, y, z, w) \u2208 \u03a6\u22121 (a, b, c, d), then\n(x, y, z, w) is a quadruple of invariants of some ordered sextuple of the six product vectors in the kernel of \u03c9(a, b, c, d).\nMoreover, the type of this sextuple is ppPNNp. Consequently, the fibre \u03a6\u22121 (a, b, c, d) is finite of cardinality at most\n60.\nCorollary 8 The set, E, of all normalized 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four on H has dimension 36.\nProof. This set is a real semialgebraic set and so it has a well defined dimension, see e.g. [5]. For convenience\nwe shall work with non-normalized states, and so the dimension will increase by one. More precisely, we have\nE \u2032 = {\u03bb\u03c1 : \u03bb > 0, \u03c1 \u2208 E}. Denote by X the image of \u03c9, X = {\u03c9(a, b, c, d) : (a, b, c, d) \u2208 \u03a9} \u2286 E \u2032 . Each equivalence\nclass E \u2286 E \u2032 is an orbit of G. It follows from [9, Proposition 27] that the identity component of the stabilizer of \u03c1 \u2208 X\nis the 3-dimensional subgroup {(z1 I3 , z2 I3 ) : |z1 z2 | = 1} of G. Hence, Dim E = Dim G \u2212 3 = 33. Each equivalence\nclass E intersects X in at least one and at most 60 points. Consequently, Dim E \u2032 = Dim X + Dim E = 37. The\nnormalization decreases the dimension by 1, thus Dim E = 36.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe point out that this agrees with the computation performed in [22].\nLet p : R \u2192 R/A5 be the canonical projection map onto the quotient of R by the action of A5 . As usual, the quotient\nspace R/A5 is equipped with the quotient topology. We cannot define a map E \u2032 \u2192 R because there is no natural\nchoice of ordering the six product vectors in the kernel of a state \u03c1 \u2208 E \u2032 . However, this ambiguity disappears when we\nreplace R by R/A5 and specify that the sextuple of product vectors in ker \u03c1 is chosen to be of type ppPNNp. Thus\nwe obtain a continuous map q : E \u2032 \u2192 R/A5 . We now use the universal property of the quotient maps \u03c0 : E \u2032 \u2192 E \u2032 /G\nand p : R \u2192 R/A5 to prove the following.\nTheorem 9 The quotient spaces E \u2032 /G and R/A5 are homeomorphic.\nProof. Since the map q : E \u2032 \u2192 R/A5 is continuous and is constant on the fibers of the map \u03c0 : E \u2032 \u2192 E \u2032 /G, there\nexists a unique continuous map f : E \u2032 /G \u2192 R/A5 such that q = f \u03c0. At the end of the proof of the previous theorem,\nwe have introduced the smooth map \u03a6 : R \u2192 \u03a9. Since the map \u03c0\u03c9\u03a6 : R \u2192 E \u2032 /G is continuous and constant on the\nfibers of the map p : R \u2192 R/A5 , there exists a unique continuos map g : R/A5 \u2192 E \u2032 /G such that \u03c0\u03c9\u03a6 = gp. The\nuniversal property also implies that f g and gf are the identity maps. Hence, f is a homeomorphism.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe shall now examine the two classical examples of UPB, namely Pyramid and Tiles.\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nExample 10 The quadruple of invariants for the Pyramid UPB is (\u2212( 5 \u2212 1)/2, (3 + 5)/2, (3 \u2212 5)/2, ( 5 + 1)/2)\nwith symbol\n\u221a NPNPpP.\u221aIf we rearrange\n\u221a the five vectors\n\u221a of this UPB in order [2, 1, 4, 3, 5], the quadruple of invariants\nbecomes (( 5 \u2212 1)/2, ( 5 \u2212 1)/2, \u2212( 5 + 1)/2, (3 \u2212 5)/2). So it has the desired symbol ppPNNp and the point with\nthese coordinates is in the region R.\nWe claim that this point is the unique fixed point of the transformation \u03b1 as given by Eq. (9). Indeed, by equating\nthe two members of Eq. (9), we obtain a system of four equations. The first two equations can be solved easily and\ngive\nc=\n\n1 \u2212 b \u2212 ab + a2 b2\n,\n(1 \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 a \u2212 b)\n\nd=\n\na+b\u22121\n.\n1 \u2212 b(1 \u2212 ab)\n\n(20)\n\nThen the remaining two equations factorize, and after droping the factors that cannot vanish when a, b \u2208 (0, 1), we\nobtain the system of two equations:\na2 b3 \u2212 ab2 + ab \u2212 a \u2212 b + 1 = 0,\na2 b3 \u2212 a2 b2 \u2212 a2 b \u2212 2ab2 + 3ab + b \u2212 1 = 0.\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nThe resultant of these two polynomials\u221awith respect to the variable a is b(1 + b2 )(1 \u2212 b)3 (1 \u2212 b \u2212 b2 ). It has a unique\nroot in the interval (0, 1) namely b = ( 5 \u2212 1)/2. The proof of our claim can now be completed easily.\nMoreover, one can verify that the transformation \u03b2 fixes the unique fixed point of \u03b1. Hence, this point is fixed by\nall elements of A5 . Note that this observation agrees with the fact mentioned in [9] that the stabilizer of Pyramid\nPPTES in the group PGL3 \u00d7 PGL3 is the alternating group A5 .\n\u0003\nExample 11 Let us now consider the Tiles UPB. The quadruple of its invariants is (\u22121/2, 2, 1/3, 3/2) again\nwith symbol NPNPpP. By rearranging the five vectors in order [2, 1, 4, 3, 5], we obtain the quadruple of invariants\n\n\f7\n(1/2, 2/3, \u22121, 1/2) having the desired symbol ppPNNp. The orbit of A5 containing the point (1/2, 2/3, \u22121, 1/2) \u2208 R\nhas size five. The other four points of this orbit are (1/2, 1/2, \u22122, 1/4), (2/3, 1/2, \u22122, 1/2), (2/3, 3/4, \u22123, 1/3) and\n(3/4, 2/3, \u22121, 1/3). Each of these five points (x, y, z, w) gives the parameters (a, b, c, d) = \u03a6(x, y, z, w) \u2208 \u03a9 such that\nthe state \u03c9(a, b, c, d) \u2208 E \u2032 is equivalent to the PPTES obtained from Tiles.

The parameter \u03bb is assumed to be positive and different from 1. For simplicity, we\nshall assume that 0 < \u03bb < 1. The six product vectors in ker \u03c1\u03bb are the tensor products of the corresponding columns\nin the following two 3 \u00d7 6 matrices\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 0 \u03bb 1 0 \u2212\u03bb\n\u2212\u03bb 0 1 \u03bb 0 1\n\uf8f0 \u03bb 1 0 \u2212\u03bb 1 0 \uf8fb , \uf8f0 1 \u2212\u03bb 0 1 \u03bb 0 \uf8fb .\n(24)\n0 \u03bb 1 0 \u2212\u03bb 1\n0 1 \u2212\u03bb 0 1 \u03bb\n\nThis sextuple of product vectors has symbol pNNPpp. After interchanging the third and fourth columns of both\nmatrices, the symbol becomes ppPNNp and a computation shows that the quadruple of invariants of the reordered\nsextuple is given by\nJ1A =\n\n1 + \u03bb3\n,\n2\n\nJ2A =\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3\n,\n1 + \u03bb3\n\nJ2B = \u2212\n\n1 + \u03bb3\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3\n\nJ3B =\n\n2\u03bb3\n.\n1 + \u03bb3\n\n(25)\n\nBy applying the formulae (11)-(14), we conclude that \u03c1\u03bb is equivalent to the state \u03c3 defined in Proposition 4, with\na, b, c, d > 0 given by\nb2 =\n\n2\u03bb6\n,\n1 + \u03bb6\n\nc2 =\n\n(3 + \u03bb6 )(1 + 3\u03bb6 )\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb6 )2\n\nd2 =\n\n2\n,\n1 + \u03bb6\n\na=\n\nbcd (1 \u2212 \u03bb12 )(1 + 3\u03bb6 )\n*\n.\n2\u03bb6\n(3 + \u03bb6 )2\n\n(26)\n\u0003\n\nFinally we show a simple result on PPTES.\nLemma 13 Given \u03c1 \u2208 E \u2032 , there is no 3 \u00d7 3 extreme state \u03c3 of rank five, such that R(\u03c3) = ker \u03c1.\nProof. Suppose such \u03c3 exists. We may assume that \u03c1 = \u03c9(a, b, c, d) for some a, b, c, d > 0. Using Eq. (7), the\nproduct vector |00i belongs to R(\u03c3) and R(\u03c3 \u0393 ). So \u03c3 is not an edge state, and we have reached a contradiction. \u2293\n\u2294\nIV.\n\nCHECKERBOARD STATES\n\nOne of the early examples of PPTES was the multi-parameter family of checkerboard states constructed in [6],\nsee also [15]. We will show that, up to equivalence, all checkerboard PPTES can be parametrized by just two real\nparameters. By using invariants, we have devised a test for checking whether an arbitrary 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four\nis equivalent to a checkerboard state.\n\n\f8\nWe define the checkerboard states (see [8, section 7]) to be the states \u03c1 which can be written as \u03c1 = C \u2020 C, where\nC = [C1 C2 C3 ] and the Ci are complex matrices having the following form:\na\n\uf8ec0\nC1 = \uf8ed\nj\n0\n\n0\ng\n0\nq\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nd\n0 \uf8f7\n,\nm\uf8f8\n0\n\n0\n\uf8ecf\nC2 = \uf8ed\n0\np\n\uf8eb\n\nc\n0\nl\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\ni\uf8f7\n,\n0\uf8f8\ns\n\nb\n\uf8ec0\nC3 = \uf8ed\nk\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nh\n0\nr\n\n\uf8f6\ne\n0\uf8f7\n.\nn\uf8f8\n0\n\n(27)\n\nProposition 14 Every checkerboard PPTES is equivalent to one with\n1\n\uf8ec0\nC1 = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nu\n0\n0\n\n0\n\uf8ec1\nC2 = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n,\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\nu\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n\uf8ec0\nC3 = \uf8ed\nv\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n,\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nv\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n,\n1\uf8f8\n0\n\nu, v > 0.\n\n(28)\n\nConsequently, there exist 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four not equivalent to any checkerboard state.\nProof. Let \u03c1 = C \u2020 C be a 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four, where C = [C1 C2 C3 ] with the Ci given by (27). Then any\nlinear combination of the Ci must have rank at least two. By replacing C1 with a suitable linear combination of C1\nand C3 , we can assume that am = dj. By applying an ILO and premultiplying C by a unitary matrix, we may assume\nthat\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\nb 0 e\n0 c 0\n1 0 0\n\uf8ec0 h 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ecf 0 i\uf8f7\n\uf8ec0 1 0\uf8f7\n.\n(29)\n, C3 = \uf8ed\n, C2 = \uf8ed\nC1 = \uf8ed\nk 0 n\uf8f8\n0 l 0\uf8f8\n0 0 0\uf8f8\n0 r 0\np 0 s\n0 0 0\nSince \u03c1\u0393 \u2265 0, we must have e = i = 0. By using another ILO, we can further simplify these matrices to obtain\n1\n\uf8ec0\nC1 = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n,\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\n0\n\uf8ec1\nC2 = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\nc\n0\nl\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n,\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n0\n\uf8ec0\nC3 = \uf8ed\nk\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nh\n0\nr\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n.\n1\uf8f8\n0\n\n(30)\n\nAs \u03c1 is entangled, R(\u03c1) must be a CES and so chlr 6= 0. By using an argument from the proof of [8, Theorem 28],\nwe obtain that h = rk \u2217 , |c| = 1 and l = cr\u2217 k/k \u2217 . Thus\n1\n\uf8ec0\nC1 = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n,\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\n0\nc\n0\n\uf8ec1\nC2 = \uf8ed\n0 cr\u2217 k/k \u2217\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n,\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n0 0\n\uf8ec 0 rk \u2217\nC3 = \uf8ed\nk 0\n0 r\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n.\n1\uf8f8\n0\n\n(31)\n\nLet us choose u2 such that u22 = c and premultiply C with the unitary matrix diag(1, u2 , u3 , u4 ), where u3 = |r|k \u2217 /r\u2217 k\nand u4 = u2 |k|/k. Next we postmultiply each Ci with diag(1, u\u22172 /|r|, |k|/k \u2217 ), and multiply C2 and C3 with u\u22172 and\n|rk|/rk \u2217 , respectively. (Note that these transformations form an ILO.) Now we have\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 1/|r| 0 \uf8f7\n,\nC1 = \uf8ed\n0 0 0\uf8f8\n0 0 0\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 1/|r| 0\n\uf8ec1 0 0\uf8f7\n,\nC2 = \uf8ed\n0 1 0\uf8f8\n0 0 1\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec 0\nC3 = \uf8ed\n|k|\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n|k|\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n.\n1\uf8f8\n0\n\n(32)\n\nThus the first assertion is proved, and the second follows from the first because the matrices (28) depend only on two\npositive parameters.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe can now characterize the checkerboard PPTES up to equivalence.\nProposition 15 A 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four is equivalent to a checkerboard state if and only if, for some ordering of\nthe product vectors in its kernel, its invariants are of type PNNpPP and satisfy the equations J2A = J3A and J2B = J3B .\nProof. Necessity. Let \u03c1 be a 3 \u00d7 3 checkerboard PPTES of rank four and (J1A , J2A , J3A , J1B , J2B , J3B ) its invariants\nwith symbol PNNpPP. By Proposition 14 we have \u03c1 = C \u2020 C where C = [C1 C2 C3 ] and the Ci are given by (28). We\n\n\f9\nhave to find the six product vectors in ker \u03c1. First observe that the product vectors |\u03c60 i = |02i and |\u03c65 i = |20i \u2212 v|22i\nbelong to ker \u03c1. Let us exhibit the remaining four.\nLet \u00b1x1 , \u00b1x2 be the roots of the biquadratic polynomial f (x) = u2 (1 + v 2 )x4 \u2212 (u2 v 2 + 2u2 + v 2 )x2 + u2 . Since\nf (1) = \u2212v 2 < 0, we may assume that 0 < x1 < 1 < x2 . For any real t let |\u03c6(t)i = |\u03b1(t)i \u2297 |\u03b2(t)i, where\n|\u03b1(t)i = v|0i + tv|1i + u(t2 \u2212 1)|2i and |\u03b2(t)i = uvt2 |0i \u2212 tv|1i + (t2 \u2212 1)|2i. One can easily verify that the product\nvectors |\u03c61 i = |\u03c6(x1 )i, |\u03c62 i = |\u03c6(\u2212x1 )i, |\u03c63 i = |\u03c6(x2 )i, |\u03c64 i = |\u03c6(\u2212x2 )i belong to ker \u03c1.\nA computation shows that the invariants of the sextuple (|\u03c6i i)5i=0 are (1/\u03bc2 , \u2212\u03bc, \u2212\u03bc, 1/\u03bb2 , \u03bb, \u03bb), where \u03bb = (x2 +\nx1 )/(x2 \u2212 x1 ) > 1 and \u03bc = \u03bb(1 \u2212 x1 x2 )/(1 + x1 x2 ) < \u03bb. As x21 x22 = 1/(1 + v 2 ) < 1, we have \u03bc > 0. From the equality\nx21 = (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc)(\u03bb \u2212 1)/(\u03bb + \u03bc)(\u03bb + 1) we deduce that \u03bc < 1. Hence, the invariants indeed have the required symbol\nPNNpPP and the equalities J2A = J3A and J2B = J3B hold.\nSufficiency. Now assume that \u03c3 is a 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of rank four and that (J1A , J2A , J3A , J1B , J2B , J3B ) are the invariants,\nhaving the symbol PNNpPP, of some sextuple of product vectors in ker \u03c3. We also assume that J2A = J3A and J2B = J3B ,\nand so we can write these invariants as (1/\u03bc2 , \u2212\u03bc, \u2212\u03bc, 1/\u03bb2, \u03bb, \u03bb), where \u03bb > 1 and \u03bc > 0. Since the first letter of the\nabove symbol is P, we have \u03bc < 1. We set\n\u221a\n2 \u03bb\u03bc\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc \u03bb2 + 1\nv=\n> 0, w = 2 *\n*\n.\n(33)\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bc\n\u03bb + \u03bc \u03bb2 \u2212 1\nIt is not hard to verify that\n(1 + v 2 )(w \u2212 1) \u2212 1 =\n\n4\u03bb2 (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )\n> 0,\n\u2212 1)(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc)2\n\n(\u03bb2\n\n(34)\n\nand so we can define u > 0 by the equation u2 ((1 + v 2 )(w \u2212 1) \u2212 1) = v 2 .\nLet \u03c1 = C \u2020 C be the checkerboard state where C = [C1 C2 C3 ] and the Ci are given by (28) with the parameters\nu and v as defined above. The biquadratic polynomial f (x) = u2 (1 + v 2 )x4 \u2212 (u2 v 2 + 2u2 + v 2 )x2 + u2 has roots\n\u00b1x1 , \u00b1x2 , where x1 , x2 > 0 are given by\nx21 =\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc)(\u03bb \u2212 1)\n,\n(\u03bb + \u03bc)(\u03bb + 1)\n\nx22 =\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc)(\u03bb + 1)\n.\n(\u03bb + \u03bc)(\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n(35)\n\nThe computation performed in the first part of the proof shows that (1/\u03bc2 , \u2212\u03bc, \u2212\u03bc, 1/\u03bb2, \u03bb, \u03bb) are also the invariants\nof a sextuple of product vectors in ker \u03c1. Hence, \u03c1 and \u03c3 are equivalent.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe remark that if we use the invariants of type ppPNNp (instead of PNNpPP) then the two equations in the\nproposition should be replaced by J2A + J3A = 2J2A J3A and J2B + J3B = 2J2B J3B . Since in Theorems 6,7 we use only the\ninvariants J1A , J2A , J2B and J3B , we mention that the former equation can be rewritten as J2A (1 \u2212 J1A J2A ) = 1 \u2212 J2A .\nV.\n\nEXTREME AND EDGE 3 \u00d7 3 STATES\n\nIn recent years extreme and edge 3 \u00d7 3 states have been extensively studied. A primary reason is that PPTES do\nnot exist in any bipartite space of smaller dimension [24, 26, 27]. On the other hand, many important problems are\nopen for 3 \u2297 3 systems. For example, a 3 \u00d7 3 PPT state of rank four is separable if and only if there is a product vector\nin the range of this state [8]. But there is no analytical criterion for deciding which 3 \u00d7 3 states of rank larger than\nfour are separable. It is also unknown whether two-qutrit entangled states of rank larger than three are distillable\n[7, 8]. Characterizing 3 \u00d7 3 extreme and edge PPTES may provide a better understanding of these problems.\nWe begin with extreme states. There is a simple necessary condition for extremality of states [31].\nProposition 16 Let \u03c1 be an M \u00d7 N PPT state of birank (r, s). If r2 + s2 > M 2 N 2 + 1 then \u03c1 is not extreme.\nBy this proposition, the birank of an extreme 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES \u03c1 must be (up to ordering) one of the following five\npairs:\n(4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7).\n\n(36)\n\nExamples for the first three pairs have been known for some time. First, the extreme states \u03c1 of birank (4, 4) were\nthoroughly analyzed and characterized by UPB [9, 35]. Second, the edge states \u03c1 of biranks (5, 5) and (6, 6) have\nbeen analytically constructed [13]. They were proved to be extreme in Ref. [20, 28]. Third, families of edge states \u03c1\nfor the remaining two pairs, (5, 6) and (5, 7), have been constructed very recently [30]. In Table I at the end of this\nsection, we will show that for suitable parameter values, these edge states turn out to be extreme. They are the first\n\n\f10\nexamples of extreme states \u03c1 with rank \u03c1 6= rank \u03c1\u0393 . Hence, each of the pairs (36) is the birank of some 3 \u00d7 3 extreme\nstate.\nNext we consider the 3 \u00d7 3 edge states \u03c1 of birank (r, s).\nBy [9] we have r = 4 if and only if s = 4. It is known that r + s \u2264 14 [29, 30]. (It has been claimed in [34] that\nr + s \u2264 13. However, it was shown in [29, 30] that this claim is false.) The birank (r, s) cannot be equal to (5, 9)\nbecause any 5-dimensional subspace of H contains at least one product vector.\nWe conclude that, up to ordering, (r, s) must be one of the following eight pairs:\n(4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8).\n\n(37)\n\nRecall that there exist extreme states for the first five pairs. As any extreme state of rank bigger than one is also\nan edge state, it remains to consider only the last three pairs in this list. Such edge states have been constructed\nrecently in [30]. Since the examples for the first five pairs in (37) are extreme states, it is an interesting question to\nask whether in these five cases there exist 3 \u00d7 3 edge states \u03c1 which are not extreme.\nWe have constructed such states \u03c1 (see Table I) for pairs (6, 6), (5, 6) and (5, 7). Since every PPTES of birank\n(4, 4) is extreme, only the case (5, 5) remains in doubt. We have tested a few known 3 \u00d7 3 edge states of birank (5, 5),\nbut all of them turned out to be extreme (see Table I). We conjecture that any 3 \u00d7 3 edge state of birank (5, 5) is\nextreme. This should be compared with the known result that any 2 \u00d7 4 PPTES of birank (5, 5) is extreme [1]. The\n3 \u00d7 3 case is more challenging because there exist 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of birank (5, 5) which are not edge states. An example\nis \u03c1 = \u03c3 + \u01eb|00ih00| where \u03c3 is a 3 \u00d7 3 PPTES of birank (4, 4), and \u01eb > 0 is sufficiently small.\nAnother interesting problem is whether our results can be extended to higher dimensions. For instance, examples of\nextreme M \u00d7 N PPTES of rank M + N \u2212 2 have been constructed recently [11].
