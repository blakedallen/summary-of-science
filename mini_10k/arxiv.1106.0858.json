This provides an avenue for obtaining\nthese bounds when Neumann boundary conditions are imposed.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet (\u03a9, g) be a Riemannian manifold with boundary of dimension n \u2265 2, and let\nu(t, x) : [\u2212T, T ] \u00d7 \u03a9 \u2192 C be the solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n(1.1)\n\n(Dt + \u2206g )v(t, x) = 0 ,\n\nv(0, x) = f (x) ,\n\nwhere \u2206g is assumed to be positive and Dt = \u2212i\u2202t . We assume in addition that v\nsatisfies either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions\n(1.2)\n\nv(t, x)\n\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\n=0\n\nor\n\n\u2202\u03bd v(t, x)\n\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\n= 0,\n\nwhere \u2202\u03bd denotes the normal derivative along the boundary.\nIn recent years there has been a great deal of interest in establishing space-time\nintegrability estimates for solutions to (1.1). One family of particular interest are\nthe Strichartz estimates, which state that for certain triples (p, q, s) with 2 < p \u2264 \u221e,\n2 \u2264 q < \u221e, and s \u2265 0\n(1.3)\n\nkvkLp ((\u2212T,T );Lq (\u03a9)) . kf kH s (\u03a9) .\n\nHere H s (\u03a9) denotes the L2 Sobolev space of order s, defined with respect to the\nspectral resolution of either the Dirichlet or Neumann Laplacian (cf. the concluding\nremark in [4, \u00a71]). Strichartz inequalities provide one of the most efficient ways of\nhandling the perturbative theory for many nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations. The\nnonlinearity appearing in these equations often involve powers of the solution on\nthe right hand side, and as such these inequalities such as (1.3) provide an effective\navenue for controlling the strength of the nonlinearity.\nAny solution to (1.1) in Euclidean space (\u03a9 = Rn , gij = \u03b4ij ) can be rescaled to\nproduce a new solution to the same equation. This gives rise to the admissability\nThe author was supported by the National Science Foundation grants DMS-0801211, DMS1001529.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMATTHEW D. BLAIR\n\ncondition on the triple (p, q, s)\nn\n2 n\n+ \u2265 \u2212 s.\np\nq\n2\nAnalogous considerations show that this restriction must also hold for any equation\nposed on a manifold. When equality holds in (1.4), the estimate is said to be scale\ninvariant. Otherwise, we say there is a loss of derivatives in the estimate as it\ndeviates from the optimal regularity predicted by scaling.\nStrichartz estimates are best understood for the equation posed on Euclidean\nspace see [24], [9], [14] and references therein. In this case, the scale invariant\nestimates hold for any triple with s = 0 and one can take T = \u221e. Sobolev\nembedding then implies estimates for any s > 0. We therefore refer to exponents\np, q satisfying 2p + nq < n2 as subcritical since the proof of scale invariant estimates\nin this case does not use the full rate of dispersion for solutions to (1.1). Otherwise\nif 2p + nq = n2 , the exponents are considered to be critical.\nThe issue is considerably more difficult when one begins to consider boundary\nvalue problems in Rn . This is due to several reasons, the most notable of which\nis that boundary conditions begin to affect the flow of energy, which in turn can\ninhibit dispersion, complicate parametrix constructions, or both. In spite of this,\nthere has been some partial progress in this area. To date, the strongest results are\nfor solutions in nontrapping exterior domains \u03a9 = Rn \\K, gij = \u03b4ij where K is taken\nto be a compact obstacle whose boundary forms a smooth embedded hypersurface\nin Rn . An exterior domain is said to be nontrapping if every unit speed broken\nbicharacteristic escapes a compact set in \u03a9 in finite time. In this case, one has the\nfollowing local smoothing estimate of Burq-G\u00e9rard-Tzvetkov [5]\n(1.4)\n\n(1.5)\n\nk\u03c6vk\n\n1\n\nL2 ((\u2212T,T );H s+ 2 (\u03a9))\n\n\u2264 Ckf kH s (\u03a9) ,\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 Cc\u221e (\u03a9).\n\nLocal smoothing estimates have a long tradition in the analysis of Schr\u00f6dinger\nequations on Rn and originate in the work of Constantin and Saut [7], Sj\u00f6lin [20],\nVega [26], and others. One heuristic argument for the estimate (1.5) follows by\nwave packet analysis. A coherent wave packet supported at a large frequency scale\n\u03bb should propagate at speed \u2248 \u03bb and hence spend time \u2248 1/\u03bb within the support\nof \u03c6. Taking the square integral in time should thus yield a gain of one half a\nderivative.\nThe connection between local smoothing bounds and Strichartz estimates was\nobserved by Journ\u00e9-Soffer-Sogge [13], who considered Schr\u00f6dinger equations on Rn\ninvolving a potential term. They observed that local smoothing bounds control the\nerror which arises by taking the free evolution to be a parametrix for the equation.\nA similar approach was used by Staffilani-Tataru [23] to establish scale invariant\nStrichartz estimates in certain nontrapping metric perturbations of the Laplacian\non Rn . Here the idea is that local smoothing bounds control the errors which arise\nin localizing the problem in space, which can be accomplished by using smooth\ncutoff functions. This in turn reduces matters to establishing a parametrix for the\nequation which may only invert the equation locally, say within the domain of a\nsuitable local diffeomorphism. This approach was then adapted to exterior domain\nproblems by Burq-G\u00e9rard-Tzvetkov [5] and Anton [1]. However in each case, the\nparametrix construction involved did not yield scale invariant estimates.\nRecently, there have been a few results which have improved the losses coming\nfrom these parametrix constructions. The works of Planchon and Vega [19] and\n\n\fREFINED LOCAL SMOOTHING FOR THE SCHR\u00d6DINGER EQUATION IN DOMAINS\n\n3\n\nthe author with Smith and Sogge [4] prove scale invariant estimates for equations\nin any nontrapping exterior domain, but have restrictions on the admissibility of\nthe Lebesgue exponents p, q. That is, the estimates are only valid for a subset\nof the exponents p, q satisfying (1.4). However, when the obstacle K is strictly\nconvex, Ivanovici [10] showed that the full range of Strichartz estimates hold for\nthe Dirichlet problem. She showed that the Melrose-Taylor parametrix inverts the\nequation locally and then used it to prove the desired estimates.\nIn this work, we consider an alternative approach to Strichartz estimates in\ndomains exterior to a strictly convex obstacle. It uses refinements of the local\nsmoothing estimates to control the error terms which arise in the wave packet\nparametrix construction of [4]. Such an approach has already been considered in\ntwo contexts. One is the work of Tataru [25], who once again considered variable\ncoefficient Schr\u00f6dinger equations, but treated a more general family of asymptotically flat metrics. Here a wave packet parametrix is used, but in order to control the\nerror terms, a local smoothing estimate is needed on frequency dependent scales.\nAn improved estimate is obtained by restricting the solution to annuli whose size\nmay depend on the frequency of the solution. A related approach was considered\nin other works of Ivanovici [11], [12], who proved frequency dependent estimates for\ndomains which are exterior to the unit ball in Rn (cf. Theorem 1.2 below). Here\nthe solution is restricted to a frequency dependent collars about the boundary. It\nwas then shown that when such an estimate is combined with Sobolev embedding,\nStrichartz estimates with a loss of derivatives follow as a result.\nIn order to describe the refined local smoothing estimates considered here, we let\n\u03b2 be a smooth bump function compactly supported in the interval (0, 4). Given a\nsolution v to (1.1), (1.2) with f \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) and a frequency scale \u03bb \u226b 1, we may define\n\u03b2(\u2212\u03bb\u22122 Dt )v as the tempered distribution F\u22121 {\u03b2(\u2212\u03bb\u22122 *)Fv}, where F denotes the\npartial Fourier transform in time. We now let d(x, \u2202\u03a9) denote the distance from x\nto the boundary of \u03a9 and let \u03c7j be a bump function satisfying\n(1.6)\n\nsupp(\u03c7j ) \u2282 {x : 0 \u2264 d(x, \u2202\u03a9) \u2264 2\u2212j+1 },\n\n\u03c7j\n\n{x:d(x,\u2202\u03a9)\u2208[0,2\u2212j ]}\n\n\u2261 1.\n2\n\nThe local smoothing estimates we examine state that if \u03bb \u226b 1 and 1 \u2265 2\u2212j \u2265 \u03bb\u2212 3 ,\n(1.7)\n\n1\n\nj\n\nk\u03b2(\u2212\u03bb\u22122 Dt )\u03c7j vkL2 (R\u00d7\u03a9) \u2264 C\u03bb\u2212 2 2\u2212 4 kf kL2(\u03a9) ,\n\nwith C independent of \u03bb, j and v. Our main theorem states that whenever these\nestimates are valid, they imply scale invariant Strichartz estimates for subcritical\n(p, q).\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose K \u2282 Rn is any smooth, compact, strictly convex obstacle\nand \u03a9 = Rn \\ K. If the estimates (1.7) are satisfied for solutions v to (1.1),\n(1.2) then the scale invariant Strichartz estimates (1.3) are valid provided (p, q) are\nsubcritical, that is p2 + nq < n2 . Moreover, if p2 + nq = n2 , then the estimates (1.3) are\nvalid for any s > 0 (i.e. they hold with an arbitrarily small loss of derivatives).\nIt is expected that the local smoothing bounds (1.7) should hold for any domain\nwhich is exterior to a strictly convex obstacle. Indeed, any wave packet at frequency\nj\n\u03bb concentrated along a glancing ray should spend a time comparable to \u03bb\u22121 2\u2212 2 in\nthe support of \u03c7j . Taking the square integral in time should thus yield a gain of\nj\n1\n\u03bb\u2212 2 2\u2212 4 . It appears to be difficult to prove these estimates in general. However,\nas alluded to above, they are valid in the exterior of a ball.\n\n\f4\n\nMATTHEW D. BLAIR\n\nTheorem 1.2 (O. Ivanovici). Suppose K is the unit ball in Rn and \u03a9 = Rn \\ K.\nLet \u2206 be the Dirichlet or Neumann Laplacian. Then given any solution v to (1.1),\n(1.2) with f \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) satisfies the estimates (1.7). Moreover, if F (s, x) \u2208 L2 (R \u00d7 \u03a9)\n\u0001\nRt\nand u(t, *) = \u2212\u221e e\u2212i(t\u2212s)\u2206 \u03b2(\u2212\u03bb\u22122 Ds )\u03c7j F (s, *) ds, we have\n(1.8)\n\nj\n\nk\u03b2(\u2212\u03bb\u22122 Dt )\u03c7j ukL2 (R\u00d7\u03a9) \u2264 C\u03bb\u22121 2\u2212 2 k\u03c7j F kL2 (R\u00d7\u03a9) .\n\nThis theorem is essentially due to Ivanovici [11], [12]. Since (1.7), (1.8), involve\na slight restatement of the estimates in her work, we make some remarks on the\nproof of Theorem 1.2 in the appendix.\nAny Strichartz estimate that results from Theorem 1.1 will not be new for Dirichlet boundary conditions. As mentioned above, they follow from a different result\nof Ivanovici [10], which shows that the full range of estimates are valid. However,\nwhen Neumann boundary conditions are imposed in the exterior of a ball, they expand the range of exponents (p, q) for which the scale invariant estimates are valid\nwhen compared to [4]. The approach in [10] uses the Melrose-Taylor parametrix,\nwhich yields Strichartz estimates in the Dirichlet case. However, at the time of this\nwriting, it is unclear that this approach can be effective for Neumann boundary\nconditions. In the present work, we instead use the parametrix construction in\n[4], which is based on one used for the wave equation by Smith and Sogge in [22].\nOne of the main steps here is to localize the solution to coordinate charts which\nflatten the boundary, giving rise to a variable coefficient problem. The solution\nand coefficients are then reflected in the boundary, which creates a problem with\nrough coefficients. Wave packets can then be used to construct a parametrix for\nthe equation. In previous works, the virtue of this approach is that it is effective in\nhandling points of convexity and inflection in the boundary of \u03a9. This even resulted\nin sharp Lp estimates on spectral clusters defined on compact domains (see [22]).\nIn the present work, the idea is that since the construction deals with the boundary\nconditions in a very direct fashion, it can be effective in treating both Dirichlet and\nNeumann conditions.\nNotation.

We focus mainly on the case of Neumann\nconditions as the adjustments needed for the Dirichlet condition are minor.\n2.1. Preliminary reductions. Here we reduce the Strichartz estimates of Theorem 1.1 to proving inequalities for solutions to a variable coefficient Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation on Rn . The approach here draws from the arguments in [22, \u00a72]. In future\nsections, we will see how wave packets can be used to prove the desired estimates.\n\n\fREFINED LOCAL SMOOTHING FOR THE SCHR\u00d6DINGER EQUATION IN DOMAINS\n\n5\n\nIt suffices to prove Theorem 1.1 under the assumption that 0 < s < 12 . This is\nclear when p, q are critical and when p, q are subcritical the full range of desired\nestimates follows from combining these cases with Sobolev embedding.\nLet {\u03c6j }kj=0 be a smooth partition of unity on \u03a9 such that d(supp(\u03c60 ), \u2202\u03a9) > 0\nand identically one on a large ball containing K. Thus when j \u2265 1, we assume \u03c6j is\nsupported in a suitable coordinate chart near the boundary. Since \u03c60 vanishes in a\nneighborhood of \u2202\u03a9, \u03c60 v solves the following inhomogeneous initial value problem\non all of Rn\n(Dt + \u2206)(\u03c60 v) = [\u2206, \u03c60 ]v,\n\u03c60 v|t=0 = \u03c60 f.\nThroughout this work, we will interpret operations such as [\u2206, \u03c60 ] as the commutator of \u2206 with the multiplication operator v 7\u2192 \u03c60 v. By [5, Proposition 2.10],\nStrichartz estimates on \u03c60 u follow from the inequalities on Rn and the local smoothing estimates on the unit scale (1.5).\nFix any j \u2265 1 and let \u03c6 = \u03c6j , suppressing j in the notation below. We may assume that \u03c6 is supported in a neighborhood of \u2202\u03a9 inside the domain of a boundary\nnormal coordinate chart. Hence we suppose that x = (x\u2032 , xn ) forms a coordinate\nsystem over supp(\u03c6) with xn = 0, xn > 0 defining the boundary and interior respectively. In these coordinates, we let gij denote the coefficient of the metric tensor\nformed by pulling back the flat metric. The boundary normal structure means that\ngin = \u03b4in and hence xn = d(x, \u2202\u03a9). We denote the Laplace operator acting on a\nfunction h(x) in\np these coordinates as \u2206g . Using the summation convention and\nsetting \u033a(x) = det glk (x), Di = \u2212i\u2202i , it takes the form\n\u0001\n(2.1)\n\u2206g h = \u033a\u22121 (x)Di gij (x)\u033a(x)Dj h .\n\nTaking a sufficiently fine partition of unity above and applying linear transformations if necessary, we may also assume that \u03c6 is supported in {x \u2208 Rn+ : |x| < 1}\nand that the domain of the local diffeomorphism defining the coordinates contains\n{x \u2208 Rn+ : |x| < 3}. However, we want the gij to be defined on all of Rn+ . To this\nend, we may assume that gij remains unchanged in the set {x \u2208 Rn+ : |x| \u2264 2} but\nthat gij (x) = \u03b4ij for |x| \u2265 3, as this does not alter the equation for \u03c6v. Furthermore,\nwe may assume that for some N large and c0 sufficiently small\nkgij \u2212 \u03b4ij kC N (Rn+ ) \u2264 c0 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nk\u033a \u2212 1kC N (Rn+ ) \u2264 c0 .\n\nSince we may assume that \u03c6 is independent of xn near the boundary, the function\n\u03c6v(t, *) satisfies the Neumann boundary condition \u2202n (\u03c6v)(t, x\u2032 , 0) = 0. The structure of the boundary normal coordinates allows us to extend \u03c6v(t, x), \u2206g (\u03c6v)(t, x)\nand the coefficients gij (x), \u033a(x) to all of Rn in an even fashion with respect to\nthe boundary hypersurface xn = 0 (take an odd extension of \u03c6v and \u2206g (\u03c6v) for\nDirichlet conditions). Given the boundary condition, the extension defines \u03c6v as a\nC 1,1 function on Rn and gij (x), \u033a(x) as Lipschitz functions on Rn .\nWe next claim that it suffices to show that\n(2.3)\n\nk\u03c6vkLpT Lq (Rn ) . k\u03c6vk\n\n1\n\nL2T H s+ 2 (Rn )\n\n+ k(Dt + \u2206g )(\u03c6v)k\n\n1\n\nL2T H s\u2212 2 (Rn )\n\n,\n\nwhere the Sobolev spaces in Rn on the right are the usual ones defined using the\nFourier transform.

The middle term is \u2248 k(1 + \u2206g )hkL2 (Rn+ ) which gives khkH 2 (Rn ) \u2248 khkH 2 (\u03a9) .\nWe now observe that this implies\nkhkH r (Rn ) \u2248 khkH r (\u03a9)\n\nfor 0 \u2264 r \u2264 2.\n\nIndeed, interpolating the H 2 estimates with the trivial L2 bounds shows this for\nany 0 \u2264 r \u2264 2.

Multiplication by the function \u033a\u22121 (\u2202i \u033a)gij is\nbounded on H r (Rn ) for any 0 \u2264 r < 12 . This can be seen by the fact that \u2202i \u033a\n1\ndefines a Calderon-Zygmund type multiplier in xn and h\u03bei 2 \u2212\u03b5 defines an A2 weight\nin one dimension and that the other factors are Lipschitz. By duality and the\nassumption that \u2212 21 < s \u2212 21 < 0, we have the desired bound (2.15).\nFor (2.13) and (2.14) we will use Khinchin's inequality and the following fact\nabout the commutator of a Lipschitz function a with a Fourier multiplier R whose\nz\nsymbol lies in S1,0\n[a, R] : H z\u22121 (Rm ) \u2192 L2 (Rm ),\nz\n\nm\n\n1\n\nm\n\n[a, R] : H (R ) \u2192 H (R ),\n\n0 \u2264 z \u2264 1,\n\u22121 \u2264 z \u2264 0.\n\nThis was observed in [2, (2.11), (2.12)] as a consequence of the Coifman-Meyer\ncommutator theorem.

Indeed, each vd\nk,l (t, *) is supported in\na cone |\u03be \u2032 | \u2264 23 |\u03ben | and hence a semiclassical rescaling t 7\u2192 2\u2212l t shows that (2.12)\nshows that follows by taking \u03bc = 2l in that lemma (in fact, this bound holds for\nany s \u2265 0).\nThe remainder of this work thus develops the bounds (2.11) on vk . We label \u03bb =\n2k as the frequency scale where vk is localized. We similarly perform a semiclassical\nrescaling t 7\u2192 \u03bb\u22121 t and set u\u03bb (t, x) = vk (\u03bb\u22121 t, x), u(t, x) = \u03c6v(\u03bb\u22121 t, x).

The tangential/nontangential decomposition. We now begin the discussion of the proof of (2.16). We are now solely concerned with estimates on u\u03bb , so\nthe notation v, w, vj will take on a new meaning for the remainder of the paper. A\ncrucial step will be a decomposition of the solution u\u03bb = v + w where the microlocal\nsupport of v(t, *) is concentrated in the set\n(2.20)\n\n{ |\u03ben | . \u03bb(\u03bb\u22122\u03b1 + x2n )1/4 },\n\nand the microlocal support of w(t, *) is concentrated in the set\n(2.21)\n\n{ |\u03ben | \u226b \u03bb(\u03bb\u22122\u03b1 + x2n )1/4 }.\n\nHere \u03b1 < 2/3 is a parameter which will be chosen below in (2.23). The motivation\nfor such a decomposition comes from the bicharacteristics of the equation, that is,\nthe solutions to\n\u1e8bj (t) = 2gij \u03bei ,\n\u03be \u0307l (t) = \u2212\u2202l gij \u03bei \u03bej .\nIf a generalized bicharacteristic curve intersects the set (2.21), it will essentially\nbehave linearly within that set (up to reflections) in the sense that its linear approximation is reasonably accurate. On the other hand, since the boundary of \u03a9 is\nconcave, \u2212\u2202n gij defines a positive definite form on vectors (\u03be1 , . . . , \u03ben\u22121 ). Therefore\nas curves pass through (2.20) they will more or less display parabolic behavior. By\nthis we mean that xn (t) is convex and that its acceleration is nontrivial.\nThe function v will be well-suited for a decomposition with respect to distance\nto the boundary. Here a key observation is that components of the function which\nare separated from the boundary will satisfy better Strichartz estimates than those\nclose to the boundary. This will be counterbalanced by the local smoothing estimates in Proposition 2.2, which are arranged so that components of the solution\nclose to the boundary satisfy better smoothing estimates. On the other hand, w\nwill be well suited for a further decomposition in frequency. Each component will\n\n\fREFINED LOCAL SMOOTHING FOR THE SCHR\u00d6DINGER EQUATION IN DOMAINS\n\n11\n\nbe microlocalized to a cone of direction vectors, all of which more or less form a\ncommon angle to the boundary. This was a key feature of the approach in [22]\nand subsequently [4]. The main idea here is that components whose momentum is\nconcentrated along rays which form a large angle to the boundary satisfy better estimates than components concentrated along rays forming a smaller angle. However,\nthe losses will once again be counterbalanced by the local smoothing estimates.\nFor reasons which will be evident later on (see (2.47)), we define \u03c3(p, q)\n(\n2\n2\nn\nn\nn\n\u2212 n \u2212 p2 , when n\u22121\n2 (1 \u2212 q ) \u2264 p \u2264 2 \u2212 q ,\n(2.22)\n\u03c3(p, q) := 12 1q\n2\nn\u22121\n2\nwhen p \u2264 2 (1 \u2212 q ).\n2 \u2212 q,\nThe precise form of \u03c3(p, q) is not all that important in the present work; the crucial\nfeature is that \u03c3(p, q) > 0 if and only if p2 + nq < n2 . In this case, we choose \u03b1\nstrictly less than, but sufficiently close to, 2/3 so that\n1\n1\n\u2212 < \u03c3(p, q).\n3\u03b1 2\nWhen p2 + nq = n2 , the difference 16 \u2212 \u03b14 will dictate the loss of derivatives in the\nestimate, hence we take \u03b1 < 32 to make this difference as small as desired. Taking\n\u03b1 < 2/3 (rather than \u03b1 = 2/3) will allow us to easily estimate the error which\narises by commuting the equation with the microlocal cutoffs to (2.20) and (2.21).\nIt also ensures that the wave packet parametrix in \u00a72.4 has a bounded error term.\nTo this end, we pause to observe that taking \u03b4 = 1 \u2212 3\u03b1\n2 > 0 means that\n(2.23)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03bb\u03b83 \u2265 \u03bb\u03b4\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhenever \u03b8 \u2265 \u03bb\u2212 2 .\n\nLet J\u03b1 be the largest integer such that 2\u2212J\u03b1 \u2265 \u03bb\u2212\u03b1 .

The\nonly difference is that the angular parameter \u03b80 is larger than what is used in that\n1\nwork (there it is assumed that \u03b80 = \u03bc\u2212 2 ). However, the proof is easily modified\nto handle this situation. We motivate the main idea here using the principle of\nstationary phase. However, since the derivatives of phase and amplitudes involved\ndepend on \u03bc, the precise arguments from [4, \u00a74] are required.\n\n\f16\n\nMATTHEW D. BLAIR\n\nAs observed in [4, \u00a74], [3, p.254], \u2212\u2202\u03b6i \u03c8(r \u2212 t, x, \u03b6) + \u03b6t,r * \u2202\u03b6i zt,r = 0 for any\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Therefore applying \u2212id\u03b6 to the phase in (2.48) gives\nx \u2212 z \u2212 d\u03b6 \u03b6t,r * (y \u2212 zt,r (z, \u03b6)).\n1\n2\n\nSince g(\u03bc (x \u2212 z)) is highly concentrated near x = z, this differential can be well\napproximated by\n\u2212d\u03b6 \u03b6t,r * (y \u2212 zt,r (x, \u03b6)),\nwhich has a critical point when y = zt,r (x, \u03b6) for some \u03b6. The Hessian is now\napproximately\n\u2212 d2\u03b6 \u03b6t,r * (y \u2212 zt,r (x, \u03b6)) + d\u03b6 \u03b6t,r * d\u03b6 zt,r (x, \u03b6).\n\n(2.50)\n\nIt can then be reasoned that zt,r (x, \u03b6) \u2248 z + 2\u03bc\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\u03b6 and that \u03b6t,r (z, \u03b6) \u2248 \u03b6\nand this approximation behaves well under differentiation. Hence the first term\nin (2.50) is small relative to the second, which is essentially \u22122\u03bc\u22121 (t \u2212 r)I. This\nillustrates why the critical point is nondegenerate.\nTo see (2.49), treat the cases 0 \u2264 |t \u2212 r| \u2264 \u03bc\u22121 , \u03bc\u22121 \u03b80\u22122 \u2264 |t \u2212 r| \u2264 \u03b5, and\n\u03bc\u22121 \u2264 |t \u2212 r| \u2264 \u03bc\u22121 \u03b80\u22122 separately. In the first case, 0 \u2264 |t \u2212 r| \u2264 \u03bc\u22121 , we see that\n|K(r, x; t, y)| . \u03bcn \u03b80 ,\nwhich is sufficient and does not use the oscillations of the phase. It just uses that\nthe integral in z is uniformly bounded and the integral over \u03b6 gives the volume of\nthe set in (2.40), which is \u2248 \u03bcn \u03b80 . When \u03bc\u22121 \u03b80\u22122 \u2264 |t \u2212 r| \u2264 \u03b5, it suffices to show\nn\n\nn\n\n|K(r, x; t, y)| . \u03bc 2 |t \u2212 r|\u2212 2 .\nSince the Hessian behaves like \u22122\u03bc\u22121 (t \u2212 r)I, this is a typical application of the\nprinciple of stationary phase. In the final case \u03bc\u22121 \u2264 |t \u2212 r| \u2264 \u03bc\u22121 \u03b80\u22122 , we obtain\nbetter estimates by applying stationary phase in the variables \u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6n\u22121 and\nignoring any oscillations in \u03b6n . The structure of the Hessian is amenable to such\nan approach. Since the \u03b6n support of the set (2.40) has volume \u2248 \u03bc\u03b80 , we obtain\n|K(r, x; t, y)| .

The bound (2.61) follows similarly. This shows\nthat the parametrix has bounded error relative to the spaces on the right hand side\nof (2.57).\nThe estimate (2.57) now follows similarly to the one in (2.36). Indeed, it now\nj\nsuffices to define the map W as in (2.41) and prove (2.43) with \u03b8 = 2\u2212 2 replacing \u03b80 .\nThe latter estimate is now a consequence of (2.49) with the same replacement, which\nin turn follows from the same considerations as before. Indeed, since we can take\nthe \u03b6 integral in (2.48) to be supported in a region of the form {|\u03b6| \u2248 \u03bc, |\u03b6n | . \u03bc\u03b8},\nthe desired estimates are a consequence of the arguments in [4].\nThe estimates (2.28) follow more directly from the results in [4]. Indeed, since\nj\nthe frequency support of the wj are localized to a set where |\u03ben | \u2248 \u03bb2\u2212 2 , this is a\nconsequence of [4, (23), (25)], the latter estimate following from [22, \u00a76]. Strictly\nspeaking, the power \u03c3 appearing there is stated only for certain values of p, q.\nHowever, as motivated above, it also holds for the value of \u03c3(p, q) determined\nby (2.22) since an estimate of the form (2.44) is established there.\n\n\fREFINED LOCAL SMOOTHING FOR THE SCHR\u00d6DINGER EQUATION IN DOMAINS\n\n19\n\nAppendix A. Remarks on the proof of Theorem 1.2\nHere we provide a brief outline of Ivanovici's proof of Theorem 1.2 and make some\nadditional remarks. As in \u00a72, attention will be restricted to Neumann conditions.\nThe estimates in (1.7), (1.8) involve localization with respect to the Fourier variable\ndual to t, as opposed to the localization with respect to the spectrum of boundary\nLaplacian appearing in Ivanovici's work, but by the functional calculus these are\nessentially equivalent. By a duality argument, it suffices to prove (1.8), leading one\nto consider solutions w : \u03a9 \u2192 C to the Helmholtz equation\n(\u2206 \u2212 \u03bb2 )w = \u03c7j g,\n\n\u2202\u03bd w\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\n= 0,\n\nsatisfying the (outgoing) Sommerfeld radiation condition\n(A.1)\n\nlim r\n\nn\u22121\n2\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(\u2202r w \u2212 i\u03bbw) = 0,\n\n|x| = r.\n\nIn [11, \u00a72.3], [12, \u00a73.1] and the estimates in Theorem 1.2 are reduced to the bounds\n(A.2)\n\nj\n\nk\u03c7j wkL2 (\u03a9) . \u03bb\u22121 2\u2212 2 k\u03c7j gkL2 (\u03a9) .\n\nThis reduction follows from taking the Fourier transform in the time variable (via\na limiting procedure) and then observing standard results on existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation. For the latter, the interested reader can find a\nsupplemental treatment in Theorems 4.37 and 4.38 in [15], which works for homogeneous Neumann (and Dirichlet) conditions.\nThe bounds (A.2) then follow by taking polar coordinates (r, \u03c9) \u2208 [1, \u221e) \u00d7 Sn\u22121\non \u03a9 so that the Laplace operator takes the form\nn\u22121\n1\n\u2206 = \u2212\u2202r2 \u2212\n\u2202r + 2 \u2206Sn\u22121 ,\nr\nr\nwith \u2206Sn\u22121 denoting the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Sn\u22121 .

BLAIR\n\nof H\u03bd (\u03bbs) in (A.5) has modulus one. The desired L2 estimates on the H\u03bd (\u03bb*), then\nfollow as in Propositions 2.5 and 2.6 in [12]. Indeed, one can take 2\u2212j \u2248 \u03bb\u2212\u03b1 in\nthat proof and by suitable bounds on the Hankel functions, the implicit constants\nthere will be independent of j.\nStrictly speaking, in the case \u03bb < \u03bd, the Neumann case requires some additional\ncare when the ODE (A.3) transitions from elliptic to non-elliptic behavior. This is\nbecause one needs to use the coefficient of the H\u03bd (\u03bbs) in (A.5) to counterbalance\nthe exponential growth of this function when \u03bbs decreases away from \u03bd. To this\nend, we observe bounds on Bessel functions J\u03bd (\u03bdz), Y\u03bd (\u03bdz) of the first and second\nkinds (which satisfy H\u03bd (\u03bdz) = J\u03bd (\u03bdz) + iY\u03bd (\u03bdz) when z \u2208 R) and their derivatives.\n2\nWhen 0 < z \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03bd \u2212 3 , we have\n(A.6)\n|Y\u03bd (\u03bdz)| \u2248\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03bd 2 (1 \u2212 z 2 ) 4\n\nexp\n\n(A.7)\n1\n\n|Y\u03bd\u2032 (\u03bdz)|\n\n\u2248\n\n(1 \u2212 z 2 ) 4\n1\n\n\u03bd2z\n\nexp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n2 3\n\u03bd\u03b6 2\n3\n\n2 3\n\u03bd\u03b6 2\n3\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2 3\n2\n|J\u03bd (\u03bdz)| \u2248 1\n,\n\u2212 \u03bd\u03b6\n1 exp\n3\n\u03bd 2 (1 \u2212 z 2 ) 4\n1\n\n1\n\n,\n\n|J\u03bd\u2032 (\u03bdz)|\n\n\u2248\n3\n\n(1 \u2212 z 2 ) 4\n1\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 3\n2\nexp \u2212 \u03bd\u03b6\n.\n3\n\n\u03bd2z\nR 1 \u221a1\u2212t2\n\nwhere \u03b6 is the decreasing function defined by 32 \u03b6 2 = z\ndt. This is a cont\nsequence of results of Olver, which proves asymptotic bounds on Bessel functions\nwhich are uniform in z and can be differentiated (see e.g. Theorem 3.1, Chapter\n11 in [18], the observations (10.18) and Ex. 10.1 in \u00a710 there, and combine these\nwith typical asymptotics on Airy functions).
