Introduction\nMicrowave technology has made remarkable progress, along with development\nof advanced communications systems that include global positional systems. This\ntechnology needs the use of stable high-dielectric ceramics. HfTiO4 and ZrTiO4 are\nused for these applications and therefore their structural and electrical properties at\nambient pressure have been widely studied [1, 2]. It is known that HfTiO4 and ZrTiO4\nhave a columbite-type ( -PbO2) structure. It has orthorhombic symmetry, space group\nPbcn, with the Hf (Zr) and Ti atoms randomly distributed on the octahedral site of the\n-PbO2 structure [3]. The temperature effects on the crystalline structure of ZrTiO4 have\nalso been studied [4]. Upon cooling it undergoes a lattice contraction and a cationpositional ordering. It is also known that the application of an electric field affects these\nstructural changes [5]. On the contrary nothing is known yet about how the application\nof pressure affects the structural properties of HfTiO4 and ZrTiO4. This information is\nrelevant in several areas of materials research and it necessary to better understand their\nmechanical properties. The importance of high-pressure structural studies has been\nshown in the case of related ABO4 oxides; e.g. arsenates [6], germanates [7],\nmolybdates [8], phosphates [9], tungstates [10], and vanadates [11]. In order to shed\nsome light on the understanding of the mechanical properties of titanate ceramics, we\nreport high-pressure x-ray diffraction studies of HfTiO4 and ZrTiO4 up to a pressure of\n17 GPa. The bulk and axial compressibilities of their structures are reported. In\naddition, we report by the first time the finding in both titanates of a pressure-induced\nphase transition to a monoclinic structure. The present work contributes to achieve a\ndeeper understanding of pressure effects on the crystal structure of ABO4 oxides of\ntechnological importance [12].\n\n2\n\n\fII. Experimental details\nCeramics with the ZrTiO4 and HfTiO4 compositions were prepared by the\nconventional mixed metal-oxide method. Briefly, stoichiometric molar mixtures of TiO2\nand ZrO2 (HfO2) powders were pressed at 180 bar to produce pellets with diameter 8\nmm and height 4 mm. The pellets were heated to 1300 oC and calcinated in air at the\nmentioned temperature for 6 h. After regrinding and repressing, in order to attain a\nbetter homogeneity of the products obtained, a second heating treatment at 1700 oC was\napplied for 24 h. The samples used in our experiments were pre-pressed pellets prepared\nusing a finely ground powder obtained from the synthesized titanates. Before loading\nthe samples into the diamond-anvil-cell (DAC), their phase purity was tested with x-ray\ndiffraction. The diffraction lines for HfTiO4 (ZrTiO4) collected at ambient pressure\n(0.0001 GPa = 1 bar) showed only a single columbite-type phase with unit-cell\nparameters a = 4.746 \u00c5, b = 5.558 \u00c5, and c = 5.038 \u00c5 (a = 4.795 \u00c5, b = 5.444 \u00c5, and c\n= 5.022 \u00c5), in agreement with reported literature values [13, 14].\nHigh-pressure angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction (ADXRD) measurements on\nHfTiO4 and ZrTiO4 have been carried out with an Xcalibur diffractometer (Oxford\nDiffraction Limited). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a 135-mm Atlas CCD\ndetector placed at 110 mm from the sample using K 1: K\n\n2\n\nmolybdenum radiation. The\n\nx-ray beam was collimated to a diameter of 300 \u03bcm. High-pressure measurements on\nHfTiO4 and ZrTiO4 were performed at room temperature (RT) in a modified MerrillBassett diamond-anvil cell (DAC) up to 9 and 17 GPa, respectively. The diamond anvils\nused have 500-\u03bcm-size culet. The titanates powders were placed in the 150- mdiameter hole of the stain-steel gasket preindented to a thickness of 60\n\nm. A 4:1\n\nmethanol:ethanol mixture was used as quasi-hydrostatic pressure-transmitting medium\n[15, 16] and ruby chips evenly distributed in the pressure chamber were used to measure\n\n3\n\n\fthe pressure by the ruby fluorescence method [17]. Exposure times were typically of 80\nminutes. The DAC used for the experiments allows access to an angular range 2\u03b8 = 25o.\nAn exposure on the starting material, at room conditions, in a 0.3-mm glass capillary\nwas obtained using the same installation with the sample to CCD distance of 110 mm.\nThe observed intensities were integrated as a function of 2\u03b8 in order to give\nconventional one-dimensional diffraction profiles. The CrysAlis software, version\n171.33.55 (Oxford Diffraction Limited), was used for the data collections and the\npreliminary reduction of the data. The indexing and refinement of the powder patterns\nwere performed using the POWDERCELL [18] and FULLPROF [19] program\npackages.\n\nIII. Results and Discussion\nThe in situ ADXRD data of HfTiO4 measured at different pressures are shown in\nFig. 1. The x-ray patterns could be indexed with the orthorhombic structure (phase I),\nstable at normal conditions, up to 2.7 GPa. At this pressure the appearance of an\nadditional peak (depicted by an arrow) is seen near 2 = 13o. Upon further compression\nadditional peaks appears and the diffraction peaks of the low-pressure phase gradually\nlost intensity. These facts indicate the onset of a phase transition to a phase we will\ndenote as phase II. The transition is completed at 8.4 GPa and is not fully reversible\nupon decompression. The diffraction patterns of the high-pressure phase suggest a\ndecrease of the crystal symmetry. The most distinctive reflections of phase II are those\ndepicted by arrows in the figure. Another distinctive feature of the high-pressure phase\nis the broadening and splitting of the peak located around 2 = 11o. From the diffraction\npatterns collected at different pressures we extracted the pressure evolution of the lattice\nparameters of orthorhombic HfTiO4. We also propose a crystalline structure for the\n\n4\n\n\fhigh-pressure phase. The x-ray diffraction patterns are plotted together with the refined\nstructure model to illustrate the quality of the structural refinements. The obtained\nevolution for the unit-cell parameters and the cell volume are shown in Fig. 2. There it\ncan be seen that the most compressible axis is the b-axis. In addition, the a-axis is\nnearly uncompressible, showing a tendency to slightly increase upon compression. As a\nconsequence of these facts the anisotropy of the crystal is reduced by pressure. This is\nbasically visualized by the merging under compression of the (021) and (200) Bragg\npeaks. The pressure\u2013volume curve shown in Fig. 2 was analyzed in the standard way\nusing a third-order Birch\u2013Murnaghan equation of states (EOS) [20]. The bulk modulus\n(B0), its pressure derivative (B0'), and the atomic volume (V0) at zero pressure obtained\nfor the low-pressure phase are B0 = 147(5) GPa, B0' = 4.5(9), and V0 = 133.1(5) \u00c53. The\nfitted EOS is shown as a solid line in Fig. 2.\nSince the low-pressure phase of ZrTiO4 and HfTiO4 can be viewed as a\nsuperstructure of ZrO2 [19], in order to propose a crystalline structure for the highpressure of HfTiO4 we have considered all the known phases of ZrO2 and TiO2 [20, 21].\nAmong these structures, the cubic pyrite and fluorite, tetragonal anatase and rutile, and\northorhombic cotunnite cannot explain all the Bragg peaks of the high-pressure phase.\nIn contrast we can explain them considering a monoclinic baddeleyite-type structure\n(space group P21/c); see Fig. 1. For this structure at 8.65 GPa we obtain the following\nunit-cell parameters: a = 4.838(8) \u00c5, b = 4.945(8) \u00c5, c = 5.060(9) \u00c5, and\n\n= 98.2(2)o.\n\nOn it the Hf and Ti atoms are randomly distributed at Wyckoff position 4e (0.2759,\n0.0395, 0.2086). Both cations are seven coordinated by oxygen atoms. This structure\nimplies a volume collapse of 5% at the transition and an increase of the Ti-O\ncoordination from 6 to 7. The orthorhombic-monoclinic transition is of first-order type.\nBoth facts are consistent with the high-pressure behaviour of related oxides [16, 22].\n\n5\n\n\fThe proposed transition is also consistent with the rutile-columbite-baddeleyite highpressure structural sequence of TiO2 and isomorphic oxides [24].\nAs we mentioned above there is a 5 GPa coexistence region between phases I\nand II. The percentage of each of the two phases present in the sample can be estimated\nfrom the relative intensity of the main peaks of phases I and II that do not overlap [25].\nFig. 3 shows the relative fractions of monoclinic HfTiO4 as estimated from III / (II III ) ,\nwhere II and III are the integrated area of the (111) reflection of phase I and the ( 111 )\nreflection of phase II, respectively. These data show that the monoclinic/orthorhombic\nratio gradually increases with pressure, reaching 1 at 8.4 GPa when the transition is\ncompleted.\nFig. 4 shows a selection of the diffraction patterns we collected for ZrTiO4.\nQualitatively, this ceramic material follows the same trend under compression that\nHfTiO4. In this case new Bragg peaks appear at 10.7 GPa. Upon further compression\nadditional peaks appear (depicted by arrows in the figure), other peaks broaden, and the\npeaks of the low-pressure phase gradually lost intensity. Clearly, the onset of a phase\ntransition takes place at 10.7 GPa. The high-pressure phase can be explained by the\nsame baddeleyite-type structure that describes the high-pressure phase of HfTiO4. For\nthis structure at 14.2 GPa we obtain the following unit-cell parameters: a = 4.836(8) \u00c5,\nb = 4.995(8) \u00c5, c = 5.075(9) \u00c5, and\n\n= 99.0(2)o. This structure implies a volume\n\ncollapse of 2% at the transition. It explains all the new diffraction peaks present in the\ndiffraction pattern and also the broadening of the (110) peak of phase I, which occurs\nbecause of the splitting of the (011) and (110) peaks of phase II. On decompression we\nhave found that the phase transition is reversible, but the low-pressure phase is fully\nrecovered only below 6.9 GPa. This large hysteresis and the volume collapse observed\nat the transition indicate that this has a first-order character. The hysteresis observed in\n\n6\n\n\fZrTiO4 also explain why the transition in not fully reversible in HfTiO4, in which the\ntransition onset is at a lower pressure (2.7 GPa).\nThe obtained evolution for the unit-cell parameters and the cell volume for\nZrTiO4 is shown in Fig. 5. There it can be seen that, as happens in HfTiO4, the most\ncompressible axis is the b-axis. Again, the a-axis is nearly uncompressible, showing a\ntendency to slightly increase upon compression. As a consequence of these facts at 16\nGPa the difference between the a- and c-axes is smaller than 2%, i.e. the crystal under\ncompression becomes pseudo-tetragonal. The pressure\u2013volume curve shown in Fig. 5\nwas analyzed in the standard way using a third-order Birch\u2013Murnaghan equation of\nstates (EOS) [18]. The bulk modulus (B0), its pressure derivative (B0'), and the atomic\nvolume (V0) at zero pressure obtained for the low-pressure phase are B0 = 144(5) GPa,\nB0' = 3.6(9), and V0 = 131.1(5) \u00c53. The fitted EOS is shown as a solid line in Fig. 5. It\nis important to note that both titanates have a quite similar bulk modulus. This\nparameter is 40% smaller than that of columbite-type HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 [22, 23,\n26], suggesting that the disorder of cations in HfTiO4 and ZrTiO4 could favour the\nvolume reduction of the crystal under compression.\nRegarding the coexistence of phases I and II in ZrTiO4, we have applied to this\nceramic the same criterion that in HfTiO4 to determine the proportion of the highpressure phase present at different pressures. In Fig. 3 it can be seen that both materials\nfollows the same trend with the only difference that the transition onset is at lower\npressure in HfTiO4. The extrapolation of the data we have for ZrTiO4 suggests that for\nthis material the transition will be completed at 20 GPa.\n\n7\n\n\fIV. Summary\nWe have studied the structural properties of HfTiO4 and ZrTiO4 under highpressure. We found that both ceramics follow a qualitatively similar behaviour. The\ncompression of the low-pressure phase is highly anisotropic being the b-axis the most\ncompressible one. In addition, compression induces a first-order transition from the\nlow-pressure columbite-type structure to a high-pressure baddeleyite-type structure. The\ntransition involves a volume collapse, a Ti-O coordination increase, and a decrease of\nthe crystal symmetry from orthorhombic to monoclinic. Finally, the EOS for the lowpressure phase is determined being the bulk modulus of HfTiO4 (ZrTiO4) 147 (144)\nGPa.\n\nAcknowledgements: Financial support from Spanish Consolider Ingenio 2010 Program\n(Project No. CSD2007-00045) is acknowledged.

Pressures are indicated in the plot.\nIn the ADXRD patterns at 1 bar and 8.65 GPa we show the refined profile (dotted\nlines). The bars and Miller indexes indicate the calculated positions of the Bragg\nreflections.\nFigure 2: Pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters and volume in orthorhombic\nHfTiO4. In the upper plot the solid line represents the EOS fitted. In the lower plot the\nlines are a guide to the eye.\nFigure 3: Relative amount of monoclinic phase I to orthorhombic phase II.\nFigure 4: Selection of RT ADXRD data of ZrTiO4 at different pressures up to 14.2\nGPa. In all diagrams, the background was subtracted. Pressures are indicated in the plot.\nIn the lowest trace the peaks of the orthorhombic phase are labeled. Most distinctive\npeaks of the monoclinic phase are indicated at 11.4 GPa.\nFigure 5: Pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters and volume in orthorhombic\nZrTiO4.
