We analyze the counts of low-redshift quasar candidates selected using nine-epoch SDSS imaging data. The co-added catalogs are\nmore than 1 mag deeper than single-epoch SDSS data, and allow the selection of low-redshift quasar candidates using UV-excess and also variability techniques. The counts of selected candidates are robustly determined\ndown to g=21.5. This is about 2 magnitudes deeper than the position\nof a change in the slope of the counts reported by Boyle et al. (1990,\n2000) for a sample selected by UV-excess, and questioned by Hawkins\n& Veron (1995), who utilized a variability-selected sample. Using SDSS\ndata, we confirm a change in the slope of the counts for both UV-excess\nand variability selected samples, providing strong support for the Boyle\net al. results.\n1.\n\nA Controversy About Quasar Counts\n\nThe quasar luminosity function, \u03a6(L), provides fundamental information about\ntheir nature. Boyle et al. (1990, 2000) found that \u03a6(L) for quasars at redshifts\nz < 2.3 resembles a \"broken\" power law which becomes flatter at the faint end.\nThey also demonstrated that the \"break\" luminosity at which the slope changes\nincreases with redshift, and between z = 0.8 and z = 2.2 becomes more luminous by 1.9 mag. A peculiar aspect of this result is that the apparent magnitude\ncorresponding to the \"break\" luminosity changes by only 0.8 mag. over this redshift range (B=18.6\u201319.4; that is, the differential distribution of quasar apparent\nmagnitudes has a shape very similar to the shape of their luminosity function).\nFurther, this apparent magnitude range is only \u223c 1-2 mag. above the photographic plate limit used for selection. Therefore, it is possible that the flattening\nof the luminosity function is due to a systematic underestimate of the increasing\nincompleteness at the faint end of the UV-excess selection technique employed\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIvezi\u0107 et al.

The\nbottom two panels show differential counts for sources from three regions in the g \u2212 r vs. u \u2212 g color-color diagram: quasar candidates\n(circles, u \u2212 g < 0.6, \u22120.15 < g \u2212 r < 0.8), hot stars (triangles,\nu \u2212 g < 0.6, < g \u2212 r < \u22120.15), and quasar-star transition region\n(squares, 0.6 < u \u2212 g < 0.8). The dashed lines, with slopes of 0.75 and\n0.30, are added to guide the eye (same lines in both panels).\nby Boyle et al. Indeed, Hawkins & Veron (1995), using a variability-selected\nsample with 300 objects, argued that \"The luminosity functions for redshifts of\nless than 2.2 show a featureless power law, with no sign of a 'break'.\"\n2.\n\nCan SDSS Resolve the Controversy?\n\nThe z < 3 SDSS (York et al. 2000) spectroscopic quasar sample is limited to\ni < 19.1, and thus not deep enough to reliably constrain the faint end of the\nluminosity function. The color selection by UV excess from the SDSS photometric sample (essentially based on SDSS u \u2212 g color, see Richards et al. 2002\nand references therein) is limited by the photometric accuracy in the u band to\nu \u223c 21, which would be just barely sufficient to detect a change of the slope\nof counts at i \u223c 20. However, the coadding of SDSS multi-epoch photometry\nproduces >1 mag. deeper u-band measurements at a given accuracy, and allows\na robust identification of UV-excess selected candidates to u \u223c 22. Furthermore,\nmulti-epoch data can also be used to select quasar candidates by variability, using techniques similar to those employed by Hawkins & Veron. This is the first\ntime that it is possible to contrast the conflicting results of Boyle et al. and\nHawkins & Veron using the same homogeneous data set.\n\n\fCounts of Low-redshift SDSS Quasar Candidates\n3.\n\n3\n\nColor Selection\n\nWe selected low-redshift quasar candidates by requiring u\u2212g < 0.6 and \u22120.15 <\ng \u2212 r < 0.7 (based on the criteria of Richards et al. 2002). Their counts, and\ncounts for two control samples, are shown in Fig. 1. The differential counts of\nselected candidates rise steeply (log(N ) vs. m slope \u223c0.75) at the bright end\n(u < 19.5, or r < 19), and then the slope changes to \u223c0.30. This behavior\nis in agreement with the results of Boyle et al., who used a similar selection\ntechnique. It is worth emphasizing that SDSS photometric catalogs based on\ndigital data are much more accurate (0.02 mag. errors, see Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2003)\nthan the catalogs used by Boyle et al. which were derived from a photographic\nsurvey. In particular, the gap between the distribution of quasars and more\nnumerous blue thick disk and halo stars (centered on u \u2212 g \u223c 0.7, see the top\nleft panel in Fig. 1) cleanly separates the two populations.\nWe note that some of the UV-excess selected candidates are not quasars:\nthe results of SDSS spectroscopic follow-up (i < 19) indicate that \u223c 20% are\nstars (dominated by white dwarfs). This correction, however, has no effect on\nthe conclusion that the slope of differential counts changes because there are\nabout 10 times fewer quasar candidates at r \u223c 21.5 than predicted by extrapolating the counts for r < 19. Similarly, star/galaxy separation is not an issue:\neven if resolved sources were added to the point sources, the counts would be\nqualitatively unchanged (i.e. the UV-excess sources are heavily dominated by\npoint sources).\n4.\n\nVariability Selection\n\nQuasars are variable sources with amplitudes of several tenths of a magnitude\nfor time scales longer than a few months (e.g. Hawkins & Veron 1995). The top\nleft panel in Fig. 2 shows the correlation between variability in the g band, |\u2206g|,\nand u\u2212g color for point sources observed twice two years apart. A large majority\nof variable sources, defined by |\u2206g| > 0.15, show UV excess (84% for u < 21.5).\nEven without accounting for the fact that some variable sources are stars (which\nwould further increase this fraction), this high fraction implies that UV-excess\nand variability selection techniques yield similar samples (see the two bottom\npanels in Fig. 2). Alternatively, 47% of sources selected by UV-excess have\n|\u2206g| > 0.15. It is therefore not surprising that the counts of variability-selected\nquasar candidates, which we define as all sources with \u2206(g) > 0.15, also show\na change of slope at r \u223c 19. Of course, this selection could be further refined;\nfor example, RR Lyrae stars, which dominate the variable star population, can\nbe easily removed due to their distinctive colors and much shorter variability\ntime scale (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2000). Such improvements would only further increase\nthe similarity of differential counts for UV-excess and variability selected quasar\ncandidates.\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe counts of quasar candidates selected by both UV-excess and variability\ntechniques using multi-epoch SDSS imaging data change slope around r = 19.\nThis result provides strong support for the quasar luminosity function and its\nevolution advocated by Boyle et al., and demonstrates that both techniques\nproduce similar samples when applied to high-quality data.\n\n\f4\n\nIvezi\u0107 et al.

The vertical full line illustrates the\nUV-excess selection of low-redshift quasar candidates from Figure 1\n(u \u2212 g < 0.6), and the horizontal line shows the adopted limit for\nthe selection of variable sources (|\u2206g| > 0.15 mag). 84% of variable\nsources show UV-excess, and 47% of UV-excess selected sources have\n|\u2206g| > 0.15 mag. The top right panel compares the counts of sources\nselected by UV-excess (circles, same as bottom left panel in Fig. 1), and\nthose selected by variability (triangles, renormalized at the bright end,\nu = 19). The dashed lines are the same as those in bottom left panel\nin Fig. 1.
