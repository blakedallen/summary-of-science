Introduction\n\"Notice that the classification of fibrations of spheres by great circles is an interesting but almost untouched subject. . . \" Arthur L.\nBesse [1] pg. 135.\nIn studying the Blaschke conjecture [1] and in the theory of elliptic partial differential equations [11], one encounters fibrations of the standard round sphere by great\ncircles.1 The best known example is the Hopf fibration\nS1\n\nS 2n+1\nCPn\n\ngiven by the circle action\nei\u03b8 (z0 , . . . , zn ) = ei\u03b8 z0 , . . . , ei\u03b8 zn\n\n\u0001\n\non the unit sphere inside Cn+1 .\nYang's conjecture [16] states that for any smooth great circle fibration of a sphere,\nthere is a diffeomorphism of the sphere carrying it to the Hopf fibration. Sato proved\nYang's conjecture for PL-homeomorphism rather than diffeomorphism [14]. Yang\n[16, 17] stated that Sato's proof is flawed, and proved his conjecture for spheres of\ndimension at least seven, missing the 3-sphere and 5-sphere, although he claimed\nthat his proof works on the 5-sphere modulo the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Ballmann\nand Grove (personal communication from Grove) stated that Yang's proof is flawed.\nGluck & Warner [6] proved Yang's conjecture for the 3-sphere. In an earlier version\nof this paper, I attempted to prove Yang's conjecture in any dimension. Yang's\nproof of his conjecture is quite difficult, involving a mixture of differential geometry\nand surgery, and employing the h and s cobordism theorems and the signature\ntheorem; the diffeomorphism is not explicit. For great circle fibrations which are,\nin a suitable sense, nondegenerate, I will give an explicit diffeomorphism, which can\nbe written in algebraic functions of the first and second derivatives of the functions\ncutting out the great circle fibration, in any local coordinates. Our diffeomorphism\nis \"linear\" on each fiber, i.e. a linear fractional transformation of each circle. The\nnondegeneracy is satisfied by the Hopf fibration, and by every great circle fibration\nnear the Hopf fibration, but I do not know if there are degenerate great circle\nfibrations.\nA Blaschke manifold is a Riemannian manifold whose injectivity radius equals\nits diameter. Every Blaschke manifold has the cohomology of a unique compact\nrank one symmetric space, its model. The Blaschke conjecture claims that every\n1Gluck, Warner and Yang [5] is a nice introduction to great sphere fibrations of spheres.\n\n\f3\n\nBlaschke manifold is isometric to its model, up to a constant rescaling. The conjecture above has the corollary that every Blaschke manifold modelled on a complex\nprojective space is homeomorphic to its model. Yang [16] claims diffeomorphic, but\nI cannot see how to prove such a result, even after a careful reading of Yang's paper,\nnor can Karsten Grove, and even modulo Yang's conjecture. An abridged version\nof the paper you have before you has appeared in the American Journal of Mathematics, with an attempt at a proof of Yang's conjecture. In 2016, I rewrote parts\nof this paper to clarify the proofs, correct errors discovered by Karsten Grove and\nWerner Ballmann, and to improve the citations. Below I give credit to Reznikov\nfor discovery of invariants of great circle fibrations, and I remove the claim that\nevery Blaschke manifold modelled on a complex projective space is diffeomorphic,\nor even homeomorphic, to its model.\n\n2. Overview\nSection 3 presents a review of some results on the topology of circle fibrations of\nspheres, which are intended for the reader's interest, but are not employed subsequently.\nThe long section 4 develops a description of a great circle fibration in terms of\nlocal data, following Cartan's method of the moving frame. This associates to each\ngreat circle fibration of a sphere a principal bundle over the sphere, with a collection\nof differential forms on it representing the local data of the great circle fibration.\nThe idea is to succesively determine subbundles of this bundle, by algebraic equations among those differential forms. This process is also a part of Cartan's method.\nIn order to make it work, one needs to find algebraic relations among the coefficients of the various differential forms, and then show that the functions expressing\nthese relations (called the torsion functions), which are differential invariants of the\ngreat circle fibration, satisfy regularity hypotheses. These regularity hypotheses are\nstrong enough that the subset on which the torsion satisfies some algebraic condition is a submanifold. Recall that the original bundle is a principal bundle-we\nwill see that these coefficients vary according to an action of the structure group\nof that bundle. This will force the subbundle on which the torsion satisfies an\nappropriately chosen algebraic equation to be a principal subbundle.\nThe first torsion to show up is essentially an endomorphism of the normal bundle\nof each great circle. (It is an endomorphism twisted by a real line bundle, but this\nis irrelevant.) Subsection 4.6 shows that this endomorphism satisfies an ordinary\ndifferential equation as we move along the great circles (using the Levi\u2013Civita connection to differentiate). This ordinary differential equation is explicitly integrated,\nand we find that consistent initial data for it which will remain finite as we tranverse\nthe great circle consists in endomorphisms with no real eigenvalues.\nThis leads to a digression: section 4.7 shows that an endomorphism of a vector\nspace which has no real eigenvalues determines invariantly a complex structure\nwhich commutes with it. Applied to the endomorphism of the normal bundle,\nwe obtain an almost complex structure on the base manifold of the great circle\nfibration. In subsection 4.8 on page 18, I change bases for the differential forms,\nsplitting forms into complex linear and conjugate linear parts, and find that the\nCayley transform of our endomorphism is a complex linear matrix with eigenvalues\nin the unit disk. The structure group of our principal bundle acts on this matrix,\n\n\f4\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nmoving its spectrum around. Section 4.9 on page 20 finds that one can normalize\nit to have vanishing trace.\nIn section 4.10 on page 24, an elementary step enables reduction of the structure\ngroup of our original principal bundle to a group \u03930 . This group is the same group\nwhich appears as structure group for the Hopf fibration. But this is exactly the\nisotropy group of a point of the base manifold in the Hopf fibration, signalling an\nend to the method of the moving frame, since there can in general be no further\nreduction, as the Hopf fibration admits no invariant subbundle contained in this\none.\nSection 5 on page 26 shows that the structure equations satisfied by our differential forms now appear similar to those of complex projective space. Section 6 on page 28 proves that the Hopf fibration is precisely the great circle fibration\nwith maximal symmetry group.\nSection 7 on page 29 turns to another description of a great circle fibration: every great circle in a sphere spans a 2-plane in the ambient vector space containing\nthe sphere, so a family of great circles is a family of 2-planes. More precisely, the\nbase of a great circle fibration is an embedded compact connected submanifold of\nthe Grassmannian of 2-planes. Section 8 on page 29 characterizes the submanifolds\nof the Grassmannian which represent great circle fibrations as being precisely those\nwhich are compact, connected, and elliptic. Ellipticity is a local condition on an\nimmersed submanifold of the Grassmannian; ellipticity is a first order partial differential inequality. I believe that this inequality satisfies the h-principle of Gromov;\nI explain in section 10 on page 34 why one is apparently unable to use Gromov's\ntechniques to prove the h-principle. The space of all great circle fibrations, viewed\nas the space of all compact, connected, elliptic submanifolds of the Grassmannian,\nis straightforward to parameterize locally, and shows itself as an infinite dimensional\nmanifold. Its topology is unknown; for example it is not known to be connected.\nIn section 11 on page 35, the geometry of the principal bundle we have constructed is used to determine an osculating complex structure at each point of\nthe base manifold of the great circle fibration. This is a complex structure whose\nassociated Hopf fibration has base manifold sitting inside the Grassmannian just\ntouching the base manifold of our given great circle fibration, and is in some sense\nthe best approximating Hopf fibration.\nAll of the theory developed in this article is based on the conviction that great\ncircle fibrations provide a very natural mechanism for deforming complex geometry.\nThis article is a contribution to the microlocal theory of such deformations. So a\ngreat circle fibration of a sphere should be thought of as a kind of nonlinear complex\nstructure on the vector space containing the sphere. The base of the great circle\nfibration is a kind of deformed complex projective space. The next step is to define\ncomplex hyperplanes in that space. We do this by looking at hyperspheres in our\nsphere, and asking for the family of great circles from our fibration which lie entirely\ninside the hypersphere. We prove that this \"hyperplane\" is a smooth submanifold in\nthe base manifold, of real codimension 2. It is not an almost complex submanifold\nin general.\nHajime Sato [14] attempted to prove part of the topological Blaschke conjecture\nusing a map, which was perhaps not well defined [16]. Therefore the next step is\nto define Sato's map. This map embeds the base of a great circle fibration into a\ncomplex projective space of much higher dimension. A diffeomorphism from the\n\n\f5\n\nbase manifold to a complex projective space is constructed out of the Sato map,\nessentially using linear projections, assuming a nondegeneracy condition. We carry\nover this map into an isomorphism of the given great circle fibration with the Hopf\nfibration, achieving our main result.\nThe analogy between great circle fibrations of spheres and complex structures of\nvector spaces is significantly strengthened in section 16 on page 46. We describe the\nnotion of twisted complex structure, or nonlinear J. To each great circle fibration,\nwe assign a nonlinear J, using local invariants. To each nonlinear J, we associate\na great circle fibration. However, the two concepts are not equivalent: rather\nthe set of nonlinear J form an infinite dimensional fiber bundle with contractible\nfibers over the infinite dimensional manifold of great circle fibrations. There is a\ncanonical section of this bundle. This picture tells us that these nonlinear J are\nreally superfluous, and that the real object of our theory, generalizing the concept\nof complex structure, is the great circle fibration.\n3. Elementary topology\nA sphere of even dimension does not admit a circle fibration. A circle fibration\ndetermines a unit vector field up to sign, and therefore determines a unit vector field\non a 2-1 cover. Because spheres of dimension two or more are simply connected, this\ndetermines two unit vector fields, and therefore shows the vanishing of the Euler\ncharacteristic. The Euler characteristic of a sphere is zero just when the dimension\nof the sphere is odd. Therefore we restrict our attention to the odd dimensional\nspheres.\nFix a smooth foliation of S 2n+1 by great circles. The foliation is a principal circle\nbundle, say S 1 \u2192 S 2n+1 \u2192 X, since the fibers can be consistently oriented, and\nthen we can apply rotations by various angles (measured in the usual Riemannian\ngeometry on the sphere S 2n+1 ) to implement a circle action. (We will see this from\nanother point of view below.) The compactness of S 2n+1 forces X to be compact.\nUsing the orientations of the circles and of the sphere, we have a quotient orientation on X. Chasing through the relevant exact sequences [4] p. 230, [10] p.\n134, the homotopy groups, Whitehead products and cohomology ring of X (with\ncoefficients in any ring; see McCleary [10], page 134) are those of CPn . (These\nauthors carry out their calculations with the hypotheses that the base manifold X\nis CPn and that the fibration is the Hopf fibration. However, they do not use these\nhypotheses. All they require is that the total space be a homotopy sphere, and that\nthe fiber be a circle.) Turning to characteristic classes [10] p. 199, follow the Leray\nspectral sequence to see that the Chern class of the bundle S 2n+1 \u2192 X (i.e. the\ntransgression of the S 1 generating class), which we write as \u2212[H], generates the\ncohomology. Keeping track of signs (using the Hopf fibration as our guide), find\nthat [H]n is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the fundamental class [X].\n4. The moving frame\n4.1. Structure equations of a flat projective structure. For my purposes, the\nsphere S 2n+1 and the real projective space RP2n+1 are equally reasonable spaces\nto work on, since a great circle fibration of a sphere is the same thing as a fibration\nof the [antipodal quotient] projective space by projective lines: choose the sphere.\nThe group of symmetries of a fiber bundle is always infinite dimensional, but in our\ncase we want the concept of great circle to be preserved.\n\n\f6\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nTheorem 1. Every invertible (not necessarily continuous) map of real projective\nspace of dimension 2 or more to itself taking projective lines to projective lines is\nthe action of a projective linear transformation.\nProof. The result is well known for projective planes [8] p. 48 theorem 3.13. Assume\nby induction that n \u2265 3 and that we have proven the result for all dimensions less\nthan n. Take an invertible map f : RPn \u2192 RPn taking lines to lines. Recall that a\nset of points of projective space is in general position if any k of them lie in a unique\nprojective subspace of dimension k\u22121 for an integer k with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Note that the\nprojective general linear group acts transitively on (n+2)-tuples of points in general\nposition. Take n + 2 vectors v0 , v1 , . . . , vn , vn+1 in Rn+1 whose images in RPn are\nin general position. For example, we can\nPassume that v0 = e0 , . . . , vn = en are the\nstandard basis vectors and that vn+1 = ei . Composing f with a projective linear\ntransformation, we can assume that f fixes the images of these points in projective\nspace. So f leaves invariant the projective subspaces of all dimensions spanned by\nany subset of these points. By induction on dimension, f is projective linear on\neach of those projective subspaces. In particular, any n of our points lie in a unique\nprojective subspace of dimension n \u2212 1, on which we find that f is projective linear\nfor a linear transformation with the various vi as eigenvectors:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX\nX\nf\uf8f0\nai e i \uf8fb = \uf8f0\nai \u03bbi ei \uf8fb\ni6=j\n\ni6=j\n\nfor some numbers \u03bbi .

Any point\nof projective space is the intersection point of a pair of lines through points of\ncoordinate hyperplanes.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1. Any continuous bijection of a sphere taking great circles to great\ncircles is the action of a linear transformation.\nProof. Any such map of the sphere takes antipodal points to antipodal points, since\nthese are intersection points of great circles. So it quotients to a map of real projective space taking lines to lines, a projective linear automorphism. After composing\nwith a linear transformation, we arrange that this projective transformation is the\n\n\f7\n\nidentity, so our continuous bijection induces the trivial projective automorphism,\nso each point is preserved or reflected to its antipode. By continuity, our bijection\nis either the identity or minus the identity.\n\u0003\nLet V = R2n+2 have basis e0 , . . . , e2n+1 . Let G = SL(V ) act on the sphere\nS 2n+1 = (V \\0) /R+ .

Lets write he0 i for the line in V through e0 .

Therefore this description of the tangent space to the\nsphere is certainly not G0 -equivariant, and it will only become scale invariant if we\nrewrite it as\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n0 \u2192 he0 i \u2297 he0 i \u2192 he0 i \u2297 V \u2192 T[e0 ] S 2n+1 \u2192 0\nwith the first map just an inclusion, and the second map defined by\n\u03be \u2297 v 7\u2192 \u03be (e0 ) v/ he0 i \u2208 V / he0 i = T[e0 ] S 2n+1 .\nWe have to check that this map is G0 -equivariant, invariant under positive rescaling,\nbecause this cancels out from each factor.

Structure equations of a geodesic foliation in a flat projective structure. Let the Roman indices i, j, k, l run from 2 to 2n + 1. Inside G we have a\nsubgroup Gcircle consisting of matrices of the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 0\ng0 g10 gj0\n\uf8edg01 g11 gj1 \uf8f8\n0 0 gji\nwith det = 1 and\n\ndet\n\n\u0012\n\ng00\ng01\n\ng10\ng11\n\n\u0013\n\n> 0.\n\nThis is the subgroup of all elements of G which preserve the oriented plane spanned\nby e0 and e1 . Under the map G \u2192 S 2n+1 , this subgroup projects to the oriented\ngreat circle which is the image of the e0 , e1 plane. This subgroup satisfies \u03c9 i = \u03b31i =\n0 as do all of its left translates, by left invariance of the Maurer\u2013Cartan 1-form.\nThus the geodesics (the great circles) are the curves in the sphere which are the\nprojections of the integral manifolds of \u03c9 i = \u03b31i = 0 in G. The manifold G/Gcircle\nis the manifold of all oriented great circles on the sphere S 2n+1 .\nSimilarly, any pointed great circle on the sphere is the projection of a left translate of the subgroup G1 of matrices of the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 0\ng0 g10 gj0\n\uf8ed 0 g11 gj1 \uf8f8\n0 0 gji\n\u0001\nwhere g00 , g11 > 0 and g00 g11 det gji = 1 (the subgroup of G preserving not only the\noriented e0 , e1 plane, but also fixing the point e0 , up to positive factor). The left\ntranslates of G1 are precisely the leaves of the foliation of G given by the equations\n\u03c9 1 = \u03c9 i = \u03b31i = 0. Hence the quotient space G/G1 is the space of pointed great\ncircles.\nStarting with a foliation F by curves, look inside G and consider the subbundle\nB1 whose fiber above any point x \u2208 S 2n+1 consists of the linear maps g : V \u2192 R2n+2\nwhich identify our point x of the sphere, i.e. a ray in V , with a given ray in R2n+2 ,\nsay the ray through e0 , and which identify the tangent line to the F curve through\nx with a given 2-plane in R2n+2 , say the span of e0 , e1 . The map B1 \u2192 S 2n+1 is\nthe pullback\nB1\n\nG\n\nS 2n+1\n\nG/G1\n\nabove the map S 2n+1 \u2192 G/G1 (taking any point p \u2208 S 2n+1 to the great circle\nwhich is tangent at p to the leaf of F through p) and so B1 \u2192 S 2n+1 is a smooth\nright principal G1 bundle. The fibers of the bundle B1 are cut out by the equations\n\u03c9 1 = \u03c9 i = \u03b31i = 0. But the \u03c9 1 , \u03c9 i are linearly independent 1-forms on the bundle\nB1 (since we have made no restriction on motions in the base manifold, the sphere\nS 2n+1 ). Therefore on this bundle B1 \u03b31i = ti1 \u03c9 1 + tij \u03c9 j for some functions ti1 and\ntij . The equation \u03c9 i = 0 cuts out a foliation F1 of B1 , by the Frobenius theorem.\nIndeed the leaves of F1 are precisely the preimages in B1 of the leaves of F down\non the sphere. To have F constitute a foliation by geodesics, we will need each\n\n\f12\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nleaf of F1 to sit inside a right translate of a subgroup of G satisfying \u03c9 i = \u03b31i = 0.\nTherefore we need ti1 = 0, and henceforth we will assume this; i.e. on B1 :\n\u03b31i = tij \u03c9 j .\n\n(1)\n\n\u0001\nThe Reznikov invariant is t = tij [13] p. 89.\nDifferentiating this last equation gives an expression for the derivatives of the\nReznikov invariant\n\u2207tij = dtij \u2212 tij \u03b311 + \u03b3ki tkj \u2212 tik \u03b3jk \u2212 \u03b4ji \u03c91\n\nand we can calculate that\n(2)\n\n\u2207tij = \u2212tik tkj \u03c9 1 + tijk \u03c9 k\n\nwhere tijk = tikj .\nNote that this \"covariant derivative\" is determined not with a connection on the\ntangent bundle, but using the flat projective connection on the sphere.\nLemma 2. Suppose that S 2n+1 \u2192 X 2n is a great circle fibration. The tangent\nbundle to X 2n is soldered by\n\u03b3ji = \u03c9ji \u2212 \u03b4ji \u03c900 .\nProof. The proof is essentially the same as that of lemma 1 on page 9, except that\nwe use the representation\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2217\n\u2217\nhe0 i \u2297 V / he0 i \u2297 he0 , e1 i\nwhere he0 , e1 i is the span of e0 , e1 .\n\n\u0003\n\n4.4. Structure equations of the Hopf fibration. To fix the Hopf fibration\nas well as the flat projective structure, transformations must take complex lines to\ncomplex lines, since the Hopf fibration on the sphere is the quotient (by rescaling by\npositive numbers) of the fibration of Cn+1 \\0 into complex lines through the origin.\nThe circle fibers can be oriented by using the natural orientation on complex lines,\nand we will take them to be thus oriented.\nLemma 3. Let V be a complex vector space of dimension at least two. Every\ninvertible real linear map of V which takes complex lines to complex lines, preserving\nthe natural orientation of complex lines, is complex linear.\nThe result is not true for V of one complex dimension.\nProof. Take e1 , e2 \u2208 V any two vectors which are linearly independent over the\ncomplex numbers. Then ge1 , ge2 must still be linearly independent over the complex\nnumbers, because e1 , e2 belong to distinct complex lines, so g must take these to\ndistinct complex lines. Take h any complex linear transformation taking ge1 7\u2192\ne1 , ge2 7\u2192 e2 . To show that g is complex linear on the complex 2-plane spanned by\ne1 , e2 it suffices to show that hg is. So without loss of generality, we can assume\nge1 = e1 and ge2 = e2 . Consequently there must be real constants aj , bj so that\n\u221a\n\u221a\ng \u22121ej = aj ej + bj \u22121ej .\nThe map g also must preserve the complex line spanned by e1 + e2 ,\u221awhich forces\na1 = a2 , b1 = b2 . Preserving the complex linear spanned by e1 + \u22121e2 forces\na1 = 0, b1 = 1.

Structure equations of the standard round metric on the sphere. It\nis helpful to compare the structure equations of a geodesic foliation on the sphere to\nthe equations we obtain with the standard metric in place. We obtain the structure\nequations of SO(2n + 2) from those of GL(2n + 2, R) by imposing the relations\n(3)\n\n\u03c9\u03bc = \u2212\u03c9 \u03bc\n\n\u03b3\u03bd\u03bc = \u2212\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n\f15\n\nIn other words, SO(2n + 2) is the connected subgroup of GL(2n + 2, R) of largest\ndimension on which these equations are satisfied.\nLemma 4. The integral manifolds of the equations 3 on the facing page are precisely the left translates of SO(2n + 2) inside GL(2n + 2, R).\nProof. The Lie algebra of SO(2n + 2) satisfies these equations, so all of SO(2n + 2),\nas do all left translates of SO(2n + 2) by left invariance of the equations. The left\ntranslates form a foliation of GL(2n + 2, R) and by the Frobenius theorem, they\nare all of the integral manifolds.\n\u0003\nConsider the equations\n(4)\n\n\u03c91 = \u2212\u03c9 1\n\n\u03c9i = \u03c9 i = 0 for i > 1\n\u03b3 = 0.\n\nThese are also the equations of a subgroup-in this case the circle subgroup of\nSO(2n + 2) which turns the e0 , e1 plane and fixes the perpendicular directions.\nLemma 5. The integral curves of equation 4 are precisely the left translates of this\ncircle subgroup of SO(2n + 2). In particular these integral curves are compact and\nZ\n\u03c9 1 = 2\u03c0\nwhen integrating over any of the integral curves.\n4.6. Following the invariants around the circles. Consider the behaviour of\nour invariant t on a circle subgroup left translate. Imposing the relations\n\u0001 satisfied\nby a circle subgroup translate given in equation 4, we find that, if t = tij is treated\nas a matrix then\n\u0001\ndt = \u2212 I + t2 \u03c9 1 .\n\nSuch a circle subgroup translate lives inside our bundle B1 above each of our great\ncircles, by construction of B1 , since above each circle on the sphere, B1 contains a\nleft translate of the subgroup G1 which contains a circle subgroup. Writing \u03c9 1 = d\u03b8\nwe have the ordinary differential equation\n\u0001\ndt\n= \u2212 I + t2 .\nd\u03b8\nConsider first how solutions of this ordinary differential equation behave if t\nis just a complex number. \u221a\nThe solutions are t = \u2212 tan(\u03b8 + c), except for the\ntwo singular solutions t = \u00b1 \u22121. So all solutions have period \u03c0. Indeed on the\nRiemann\nsphere, this equation is a rotation, and has the two exceptional points\n\u221a\n\u00b1 \u22121 as rotational fixed points.\n\u221a\n\u22121\n\u221e\n0\n\u221a\n\u2212 \u22121\n\n\f16\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nTo have our complex number t remain finite, it can never be real-valued, since it\nwould then go to infinity in time at most \u03c0/2 in one direction or the other.\nFor a matrix t the solution is\nt(\u03b8) = (t(0) \u2212 tan(\u03b8)I) (I + tan(\u03b8)t(0))\n\n\u22121\n\nand this tells us that t has no real spectrum. Since t is a real matrix, the eigenvalues\nand eigenspaces of t come in conjugate pairs. Since the equation is invariant under\nchange of linear coordinates, the eigenspaces will remain invariant under the flow,\nwhile the eigenvalues will change. For any initial conditions t(0) with no real\neigenvalues, we find that t will remain defined as a function of \u03b8 for any positive or\nnegative \u03b8. For generic initial conditions, for example for t diagonalizable at \u03b8 = 0,\nwe find that t is \u03c0 periodic. Therefore T is also \u03c0 periodic for any initial conditions\nwith no real eigenvalues.\nNotice that we have not so far invoked the hypothesis that the sphere has odd\ndimension. In fact, this is an immediate consequence of the Reznikov invariant\nhaving no real eigenvalues, since t is a square matrix whose size is one less than the\ndimension of the sphere. If t had odd size, then its characteristic polynomial would\nhave odd degree, and so would have a real root-hence a real eigenvector.\n4.7. Linear transformations without real eigenvalues. Take any linear transformation T : V \u2192 V of a real vector space V , with no real eigenvalues. We will\nalso write V as VR to emphasis that we are studying its real points, and write VC\nfor V \u2297R C. We naturally have VC split into generalized eigenspaces of T , say\n\b\nE\u03bb T = v \u2208 VC | (T \u2212 \u03bbI)k v = 0, for some k > 0 .\nSince T is real, E\u03bb T = E\u03bb\u0304 T. Pick the eigenspaces E\u03bb T of T where the eigenvalues\n\u03bb have positive imaginary parts, and define a subspace\nM\nVT1,0 ..=\nE\u03bb T \u2282 VC .\nIm \u03bb>0\n\nLet V\nbe the conjugate of V , i.e. the sum of the eigenspaces whose eigenvalues\nhave negative imaginary part. Note that V 1,0 and V 0,1 are complex subspaces of\nVC and are complementary:\n0,1\n\n1,0\n\nV 1,0 \u2229 V 0,1 = 0, VC = V 1,0 \u2295 V 0,1 .\n\n\u221a\nDefine\nJ : VC \u2192 VC by letting J act via \u22121 on V 1,0 and\n\u221a a linear transformation\nby \u2212 \u22121 on V 0,1 . This J is real, i.e. acts as a real linear transformation on VR ,\nsince J is conjugation invariant, with J 2 = \u2212I, since this equation holds on V 1,0\nand on V 0,1 by construction. Write J as JT .\nLemma 6. Let HV be the set of linear transformations of a finite dimensional real\nvector space V which have no real eigenvalues (think of it as a \"generalized upper\nhalf plane\"), and JV be the subset of real linear transformations J which satisfy\nJ 2 = \u2212I (the complex structures). Then the map\nT \u2208 HV 7\u2192 JT \u2208 JV\n\nis a smooth fiber bundle, with the inclusion JV \u2282 HV as a section. This fiber\nbundle is GL(V )-equivariant: JgT g\u22121 = gJT g \u22121 for any g \u2208 GL(V ). Its fiber\nabove any point J consists precisely of the J-complex\nlinear maps T : V \u2192 V , i.e.\n\u221a\nT J = JT , all of whose eigenvalues on (J = \u22121) \u2282 VC have positive imaginary\npart. If c 6= 0 is a real number, then JT +cI = JT and JcT = sign(c)JT .\n\n\f17\n\nProof. Notice that if V has odd dimension, then (looking at the characteristic polynomial, which is of odd degree) we find HV is empty. Similarly, taking determinant,\nwe find that JV is empty. So we can assume V has even dimension.\nThe equivariance of T 7\u2192 JT under GL(V ) is elementary.\nFirst, we construct the space Z \u2282 HV \u00d7 JV which consists of pairs (T, J)\nsatisfying\nT J = JT, J 2 = \u2212I\n\nand with T having no real eigenvalues. We have maps\nZ\n\nHV\n\nJV\n\ngiven by taking a pair (T, J) and either forgetting J or forgetting T . Now given any\nT \u2208 HV , we know how to construct a J = JT commuting with it so that J 2 = \u2212I,\ni.e. the map T 7\u2192 JT has graph lying in Z.\nOn the other hand, if we take any T with no real eigenvalues, i.e. T \u2208 HV , then\nwe can could also have constructed a J commuting with it in other ways; in fact\nif we just put any collection of eigenspaces of T together and call their sum V 1,0\n0,1\nand call the sum of their conjugates\nthat every\n\u221a V , so1,0\n\u221a eigenspace is in one or the\nother, then we can define J to be \u22121 on V\nand \u2212 \u22121 on V 0,1 . Because T has\nno real eigenvalues, this procedure unambiguously determines J, up to the choices\nof which eigenspaces of T go to V 1,0 and which go to V 0,1 .\nConversely, if we pick a pair (T, J) in Z, the fact that T and J commute ensures\nthat each one leaves the eigenspaces of the other invariant. Looking at the minimal\npolynomial of J,\u221ax2 + 1, we see that J has exactly\n\u221a two eigenspaces, and we call\nthem V 1,0 (the \u22121-eigenspace) and V 0,1 (the \u2212 \u22121-eigenspace). The map T\ntakes V 1,0 to itself, and takes V 0,1 to itself, because T commutes with J, and T\nis complex linear on each. Decomposing V 1,0 into complex eigenspaces of T , and\ndecomposing V 0,1 into the conjugates of those eigenspaces, we find VC = V 1,0 \u2295V 0,1\ndecomposed into conjugate eigenspaces of T . Because T is real, its eigenspaces are\nconjugate, with half of them in V 1,0 and half in V 0,1 . Therefore J comes about\nfrom T by the construction outlined in the last paragraph.\nThus the map Z \u2192 HV has finitely many points in each stalk-each point\ncorresponds to a choice of which eigenspaces of T go into V 1,0 . We want to show\nthat the points which make up the graph of T 7\u2192 JT form a smooth subvariety of\nZ. We have only to show that they are transverse to the fibers of the map\nHV \u00d7 JV \u2192 HV\ngiven by (T, J) 7\u2192 T .\nThe algebraic equations cutting out Z are T J = JT and J 2 = \u2212I. Differentiating these in motions up the fiber, we find that the equations of a vertical tangent\n \u0307 and JJ\n \u0307 + J J \u0307 = 0. The first equation tells us that J \u0307 preserves\nvector are T J \u0307 = JT\nthe eigenspaces of T , while the second tells us that J \u0307 swaps the eigenspaces of\nJ. But the eigenspaces of T are entirely contained inside those of J. Therefore\nJ \u0307 = 0, and there are no vertical tangent vectors. This shows that Z is smooth and\ntransverse to the fibers of HV \u00d7 JV \u2192 JV . So the map T 7\u2192 JT is smooth, being\n\n\f18\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\njust a single branch of Z, and JT = T for any T with T 2 = \u2212I. Hence this map\nT 7\u2192 JT is a smooth surjection HV \u2192 JV .\nTo find the rank of the map T 7\u2192 JT differentiate the equations J 2 = \u2212I and\nJT = T J to find\n \u0307 + J J \u0307 = 0 and JT\n \u0307 + J \u1e6a = \u1e6a J + T J.\n \u0307\nJJ\nThe kernel of the derivative of T 7\u2192 JT is the set of \u1e6a satisfying J \u1e6a = \u1e6a J, i.e.\nthe J complex linear maps. Since the real general linear group acts transitively on\ncomplex structures, we find that the space of such \u1e6a has dimension independent of\nJ. Indeed if dimR V = 2n, then the derivative of the map T 7\u2192 JT has kernel of\ndimension 2n2 , and so fibers of dimension also 2n2 . The dimension of the base is\nalso 2n2 , so the map T 7\u2192 JT is a smooth submersion.\nNext we want to show that this map is locally trivial, so that it will be a fiber\nbundle. First, we note once again that JV is a homogeneous space under the\naction of GL(V ). So if we pick a particular J0 \u2208 JV then we have the fiber bundle\nGL(V, J0 )\n\nGL(V )\n\nJV .\nEvery homogeneous space is the base spaces of a fiber bundle, with total space\ngiven by the transitively acting group. Thus this bundle is locally trivial, i.e. to\nevery sufficiently small open set U \u2282 JV we can associate a map U \u2192 GL(V ), say\ng(J), so that if g = g(J) then gJg \u22121 = J0 .\nWe map the fiber HV,J0 above J0 to the fiber HV,J above J by\nT0 7\u2192 T = T (J, T0 ) = gT0 g \u22121 .\n\nBy GL(V )-equivariance, this is a local trivialization of HV \u2192 JV , so that this\nmap is a fiber bundle.\n\u0003\nThe reader who wishes to understand this lemma might work out the whole story\nin matrices for V = R2 . This complex structure is J due to Reznikov [13] p. 89.\n4.8. Back to the great circle fibration. Inside SO(2n + 2) we do not have\nenough room to put the Reznikov invariant t into a normal form.

Henceforth we employ s instead of t and\ncall s the Reznikov invariant. The condition that t have all of its eigenvalues in the\nupper half plane is equivalent to its image s = C(t) under the Cayley map having\nall of its eigenvalues inside the unit disk. In particular, for the Hopf fibration, on\nthe subbundle \u0393 \u2282 B2 we find s = 0.\nConsider the ordinary differential equation\n\nIf we set s = C(t), then\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0001\ndt\n= \u2212 1 + t2 .\nd\u03b8\n\u221a\nds\n= \u22122 \u22121s\nd\u03b8\n\nso that s(\u03b8) = s(0)e\u22122 \u22121\u03b8 evolves by rotation.

The Cayley map identifies the upper half plane with the\nunit disk, identifying Aut D with SL(2, R). There is a (unique up to conjugation)\nconnected 2-dimensional subgroup of SL(2, R); it is nilpotent and consists of the\nmatrices of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\nb\n\u2208 SL(2, R)\n0 1/a\n\nwith a, b \u2208 R and a > 0.

One can readily conjugate with the Cayley mapping to calculate that\nthe elements of N are precisely the elements of P SL(2, C) of the form\n\uf8ee\n\u0001\uf8f9\n\u221a\n\u221a\nb + \u22121 a \u2212 a1\na + a1 + \u22121b\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n(8)\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\na + a1 \u2212 \u22121b\nb \u2212 \u22121 a \u2212 a1\n\nwhere a, b \u2208 R and a > 0. This group N acts transitively on the unit disk D,\nbecause its conjugate under the Cayley map acts transitively on the upper half\nplane. In particular, the Lie algebra of N , call it n, consists of matrices of the form\n\uf8eb\u221a\n\uf8f6\n\u0001\n\u22121\nQ\n+\nQ\u0304\nQ\n\uf8ed 2\n\u221a\n\u0001\uf8f8\nQ\u0304\n\u2212 2\u22121 Q + Q\u0304\n\nwhere Q can be any complex number.

A 1-parameter family of motions of a matrix s by\nelements of N is the same as an ordinary differential equation like\n\u221a\n\u0001\nds\n= Q \u2212 \u22121 Q + Q\u0304 s \u2212 Q\u0304s2\ndt\n\nwhere the Q(t) is any smooth complex-valued function of a real variable t.\nWe will henceforth orient the group N using the orientation of the Lie algebra\ngiven by the usual orientation of the Q complex plane.

Any element of\nN arises in this manner, since N is a connected Lie group, as is obvious from\nequation 8 on the previous page.\nLemma 7. Suppose that s is a square matrix with complex entries, and that the\nspectrum of s is contained in the unit disk. Then there is a unique linear fractional\ntransformation belonging to the group N , say\n\uf8ee\n\u0001\uf8f9\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\nb + \u22121 a \u2212 a\na + a + \u22121b\n\uf8fb\ng=\uf8f0\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\nb \u2212 \u22121 a \u2212 a\na + a1 \u2212 \u22121b\n\nso that g(s) has trace zero. This transformation g depends analytically on s.\n\nProof. Assume s is an n \u00d7 n matrix. First, suppose that s has trace zero, with\neigenvalues \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbn . Then infinitesimal motions under the group N affect the\ntrace by\n1 p\n1\nds = \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304 spq sqp .\nn p\nn\nThe first term has larger complex coefficient than the second, since having spectrum\nin the unit disk forces\n1 p q\n1\nsq sp = \u03bb2p = average squared eigenvalue\nn\nn\ninside the unit disk. Therefore the differential dspp as a linear map from the tangent\nspace of N to C is orientation preserving, and has full rank, at every zero of spp . In\nparticular, all zeros of spp are nondegenerate and positively oriented, and the set of\nelements g \u2208 N at which tr(g(s)) = 0 is discrete, for any matrix s with spectrum\nin the unit disk.\nSince N acts transitively and via isometries of the hyperbolic metric on the unit\ndisk, we can arrange that the center of mass of the spectrum, in the hyperbolic\nmetric, sits wherever we like. The problem of arranging a vanishing trace is that\n\n\f23\n\nwe have to get the center of mass in the Euclidean metric to vanish, and it is not\nobvious that this is possible.\nWe will analyze the behaviour of elements of N \"near infinity,\" i.e. far away from\nthe identity element. The points of the spectrum retain their hyperbolic distances\nunder maps from N , because the elements of N are hyperbolic isometries, but the\npoints of the spectrum become very close in Euclidean norm if any one of them\napproaches the boundary of the unit disk, since near the boundary of the disk, the\nhyperbolic balls of fixed radius are contained in Euclidean balls of very small radius.\nHence we can easily control the average of the eigenvalues of s, to get the average\nof the eigenvalues close to any number ei\u03b8 on the boundary of the unit disk, using\nlinear fractional transformations from N .\nUsing the coordinates a, b for the group N , we can see that elements\n\u221a of N with\na close to zero (but positive) are close to the constant map z 7\u2192 \u2212 \u22121 given by\nthe matrix\n\uf8ee\n\u221a \uf8f9\n1\n\u2212 \u22121\n\uf8fb.\n\uf8f0\u221a\n\u22121\n1\nThis matrix is not an invertible matrix, and obviously the map it generates is not\neither. Nonetheless, applying elements of N near a\u221a= 0 to our matrix s, we can\narrange that the entire spectrum of s lies close to \u2212 \u22121.\nb\n\na\n\nConsider the half circle\na = r cos \u03b8, b = r sin \u03b8\nfor values of \u03b8 from a little above \u2212\u03c0/2 to a little less than \u03c0/2. We find that for r\na large positive number, the origin of the unit disk is taken by this linear fractional\ntransformation to\n\u0001\n\u221a\nr2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u22121 1 \u2212 r2 cos2 \u03b8\n\u221a\n(1 + r2 cos \u03b8) \u2212 \u22121r2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhich,\nfor large r,\u221ais close to \u22121 for all values of \u03b8. Now try the path a = 1/ r, b =\n\u221a\n\u221a\nrt, \u2212 r \u2264 t \u2264 r. The origin is taken to the point\n\u0001\u221a\nt + r1 \u2212 1 \u22121\n\u221a\n1 + 1r \u2212 t \u22121\nwhich, for large r, is very close to the point\n\u221a\nt \u2212 \u22121\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 t \u22121\n\nwhich traverses the unit circle as t runs from \u2212\u221e to \u221e.\n\n\f24\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nConsider any 1-parameter family g\u03b8 of linear fractional transformations from N\nwhich stays close to the contour\na = r cos \u03b8, b = r sin \u03b8,\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2 + \u03b5 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b5\n\n(some small \u03b5) and then approaches a vertical\nline in the a, b plane, close to, but\n\u221a\njust to the right of a = 0, say at a = 1/ r, completing a loop. Applying g\u03b8 to a\nmatrix s, we find that (if the radius r of the half circle in our contour is set large\nenough) the average of the eigenvalues of g\u03b8 (s) travels quite near the boundary\nof the unit disk, through a single rotation. In fact, since the hyperbolic distance\nbetween eigenvalues is preserved by these linear fractional transformations, the\nEuclidean distance shrinks as we approach the boundary of the unit disk, and all of\nthe eigenvalues are very close to the average. This ensures that there must be a zero\nof the average of the eigenvalues of g(s) for some value of a, b inside the semicircle\nof radius r, since otherwise the winding number of the average eigenvalue would be\nunchanged as we shrunk the contour down to a point.\nThe winding number of the average eigenvalue around the loop is 1, and the\nzeros of tr(g(s)) are positively oriented, so there can only be one such zero, and it\nmust depend analytically on s by the implicit function theorem.\n\u0003\nFor example, consider the transformations g which take s = 0 to a traceless\nmatrix.

However, when we include the s functions, we find that they are\nnot the structure equations of a projective structure at all-in fact the base manifold\nis only equipped with an almost complex structure, which we will soon see.\n5.1. Invariantly defined vector bundles on the base of a great circle fibration.\n\n\f27\n\nLemma 8. Suppose that S 2n+1 \u2192 X 2n is our great circle fibration. The bundle\nB \u2192 X is a principal \u03930 bundle where (as in subsection 4.4 on page 12) \u03930 is the\ngroup of matrices of the form\n\u0012 0\n\u0013\ng0 gq0\n0 gqp\n\u0001\nwhere all entries are complex numbers and |g00 det gqp |2 = 1. The representation\n\u0013\n\u0012 p\n\u0393q 0\n0 \u0393p\u0304q\u0304\nsolders the tangent bundle of X 2n . There is an invariantly defined almost complex\nstructure on X whose holomorphic tangent space T 1,0 X is soldered by \u0393pq . The\n1-form \u03a900 solders the principal bundle S 2n+1 \u2192 X.\n\nProof. We need to show that the fibers of B \u2192 X are connected. But this factors\nas B \u2192 S 2n+1 \u2192 X so that the fibers of the first map are copies of \u03931 , which is\nconnected, and the fibers of the second map are circles, hence connected.\nThe 1-forms \u03a9p are semibasic for the projection to X. On the fibers of B \u2192 X the\nstructure equations reduce to the structure equations of \u03930 and its left translates.\nAs before, this shows by connectedness of \u03930 and of the fibers of B \u2192 X that the\nfibers are in fact left translates of \u03930 . Therefore B \u2192 X is a principal right \u03930\nbundle.\nThe soldering forms of the tangent bundle of X are unchanged from lemma 2 on page 12,\nbut rewritten in complex notation. The almost complex structure on X is immediately visible from the structure equations, since the \u0393pq 1-forms solder in a complex\nrepresentation.\nI have not explained what it means to solder a principal bundle out of another\none, but it should be obvious. The soldering of \u03a900 is just the quotient by \u03931 of the\nsoldering of \u03930 , which is just S 2n+1 \u2192 X.\n\u0003\nThe base manifold X is analogous to a complex projective space, and the circle\nfibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X analogous to the Hopf fibration. Therefore henceforth we will\nrefer to the complex line bundle soldered (on the bundle B \u2192 X) by \u03a900 as O (\u22121),\nand similarly define the line bundles\n\u2297(\u2212p)\n\nO (p) ..= O (\u22121)\n\n.\n\nBe careful to note that these are bundles on X and are complex line bundles. We\nwill never again refer to the similarly named real line bundles on S 2n+1 , which\nwere introduced simply to encourage an analogy between the soldering of these\nO (p) \u2192 X bundles with the similarly named bundles on projective spaces.\nFrom here on, we will use the notation W\u0303 for any complex representation W of\n\u03930 to mean the vector bundle W\u0303 \u2192 X given as\nW\u0303 = B \u00d7\u03930 W = (B \u00d7 W ) /\u03930 .\n\nconstructed in the same manner as in subsection 4.2 on page 8.

But the \u03a90q factor is not semibasic,\nso this is not actually soldering any line bundle.\n6. Homogeneous great circle fibrations\nA symmetry of a great circle fibration which preserves the flat projective structure on the sphere acts as a symmetry of the right principal bundle B \u2192 X.\nSuppose that the symmetry group acts transitively on B. Then the invariantly\ndefined functions s0q , spq etc. are all constant on B. Plugging this hypothesis into\nour equations for covariant derivatives, we find that all of the invariants vanish,\nand applying the Frobenius theorem, along with simple connectivity of X, we see\ndirectly that the great circle fibration is a Hopf fibration.\nTheorem 2. The symmetry group of a great circle fibration acts transitively on\nthe adapted frame bundle precisely if the fibration is a Hopf fibration.\nTheorem 3. The symmetry group of a great circle fibration injects into the bundle\nB, so that it is always of dimension at most that of B, i.e.\ndim Aut \u2264 2(n + 1)2 \u2212 1.\nEquality occurs only for the Hopf fibration.\nProof. If \u03c6 : B \u2192 B is a symmetry, then by definition it preserves great circles, so\n\u03c6 = g \u2208 SL(V ). If we arrange that the identity element I \u2208 SL(V ) belongs to B,\nthen gI = g \u2208 B, so in fact the diffeomorphism \u03c6 is an element of B. Therefore the\nsymmetry group is actually a subgroup of SL(V ) sitting inside B. The symmetry\ngroup is closed, since the condition of being a symmetry is a closed condition.\nTherefore it is a Lie subgroup of SL(V ) lying inside B.\nIf the symmetry group has the same dimension as B, then it is an open subset\nof B, say U , and a closed subgroup of SL(V ). But B \u2282 SL(V ) is also closed, so U\nis both open and closed in B, and therefore a union of path components of B. But\nB is connected, since it is a bundle\n\u03931\n\nB\nS 2n+1\n\nwith connected fibers and base. Therefore the symmetry group is precisely B. This\nforces all of the invariant functions s on B to be constants, and then the structure\nequations force them to vanish.\n\u0003\n\n\f29\n\n7. Embedding into the Grassmannian of oriented 2-planes\nRecall that G = SL(V ) and Gcircle is the subgroup preserving the oriented great\ncircle on S 2n+1 passing from e0 through to e1 . The space G/Gcircle is naturally\nidentified with the space of all oriented great circles on the sphere, or with the space\nof oriented 2-planes in V :\n2\nfV .\nG/Gcircle = Gr\nWe find that \u03930 \u2282 Gcircle so that a fiber bundle\n\n2\n\nf\nG/\u03930 \u2192 G/Gcircle = Gr\nV\n\nis defined, with fibers being homogeneous spaces of Gcircle -equivariantly diffeomorphic to Gcircle /\u03930 which is the space of all complex structures on V which have the\noriented 2-plane he0 , e1 i as a complex line.\nWe can map\n2\nf .\nX = B/\u03930 \u2192 G/\u03930 \u2192 G/Gcircle = Gr\nV\n\nLemma 10. This map X \u2192\n\nf2\nGr\nV\n\nis an embedding.\n\nProof. If two points x, y \u2208 X get mapped to the same place, then they correspond\nto the same great circle, since X parameterizes the great circles of our fibration,\nf 2 is parameterizing all great circles. So the map is injective.\nand Gr\nV\nWe have to differentiate to see that the map is an immersion. Pull back a local\n2\nf to X and show that it contains a coframing for\ncoframing by 1-forms on Gr\nV\nX. But then it is sufficient to pull the coframing back to B and show that on B\nevery semibasic 1-form for the bundle map B \u2192 X can be expressed as a linear\ncombination (with real functions as coefficients) of the 1-forms from the coframing\n2\nf .\nfrom Gr\nV\n\n2\n\nf are precisely those complimentary\nThe semibasic 1-forms for the map G \u2192 Gr\nV\nto the Lie algebra of Gcircle , i.e. they are the 1-forms \u03a9p0 , \u03a9p0\u0304 and their complex\n2\nf pulls back to G to be a combination of\nconjugates. Therefore any coframing on Gr\nV\nthese 1-forms, and conversely they are combinations of the 1-forms from the coframing. But pulling back to B, we find only the relations \u03a9p0\u0304 = spq \u03a9q0 . The remaining\nsemibasic 1-forms \u03a9p0 span the semibasic 1-forms on X. Therefore the map is an\nimmersion. An injective immersion of a compact manifold is an embedding.\n\u0003\n\nA consequence of the proof is that these spq invariants can be expressed in terms\n2\nf . The embedding determines\nof the first derivative of the embedding X \u2192 Gr\nV\nthe great circle fibration. This embedding is a more useful way to examine great\ncircle fibrations than looking directly at the sphere, because a perturbation of great\ncircles on the sphere can never be local, while it can be local on X, as a small\nmotion of X inside the Grassmannian.\n8.

The characteristic variety does intersect RP(P ), so consists\nin a finite set of points lying on that half, and their conjugates on the other half.\nThe linear fractional transformations we used are just real reparameterizations of\nP .

If X \u2282 Gr\nV\nelliptic at every point.\n\nProof. Pick a point P \u2208 X and a point g \u2208 B which is taken by B \u2192 X to P.\nAs expressed in terms of \u03c90i , \u03c91i above, we found earlier that a great circle fibration\nsatisfies \u03c91i = tij \u03c90j , with tij a real 2n \u00d7 2n matrix with no real eigenvalues. For\neach vector u \u2208 TP X we can write its components in the coframe \u03c90i as ui . (The\nreader who is keeping track of what spaces we are working in will be puzzled to\nread that the \u03c90i are a coframe on X. What we mean of course is that since the\n\u03c90i are semibasic, at each point g \u2208 B we can form the coframe \u03c9 i0 on TP X from\nwhich these \u03c90i are pulled back. These \u03c9i0 \u2208 \u039b1 (TP X) change as we move up the\nfibers of B \u2192 X.) Each point a0 e0 + a1 e1 \u2208 he0 , e1 i is carried by g to an element of\nP and we identify these. We find that in terms of equation 12, the map \u03b1P defined\nin equation 11 on page 30 is given, up to factors of g and g \u22121 (which won't affect\nthe vanishing of the relevant determinant) by\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b1 a0 e0 + a1 e1 (u) = a0 ui + tij a1 ui = a0 \u03b4ji + a1 tij uj .\nTherefore the polynomial \u03beP is\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03beP a0 , a1 = det a0 \u03b4ji + a1 tij .\n\nIf a1 = 0 then a zero of \u03beP can only occur at a0 = 0.

Consequently, if X arises from a great circle fibration, then X is elliptic.\n\u0003\n2\n\nf and apply the\nWe will now take an elliptic immersed submanifold X \u2282 Gr\nV\nmethod of the moving frame to calculate its structure equations.\n2\n\nf is an immersion of an elliptic submanifold.\nLemma 12.

Consider the bundle\n\u03b9\u2217 G\n\nG\n\nX\n\nf .\nGr\nV\n\n2\n\nAs before we will write \u03c6g (v) = g \u22121 v + he0 , e1 i giving a map\n\u03c6g : V \u2192 V / he0 , e1 i\n\nwith kernel P = g he0 , e1 i . Again we have the equation\n\u0001\n\u2212\u1e21 \u22121 \u03c6\u0304\u22121 d \u03c6|P ga = \u03c90i a0 + \u03c91i a1\n\nfor a \u2208 he0 , e1 i . We know that the V / he0 , e1 i valued 1-form \u03c90i a0 + \u03c91i a1 is a\ncoframing on TP X for each a 6= 0, precisely expressing ellipticity. So \u03c91i is a\ncoframing, as is \u03c90i . Consequently there is an invertible linear transformation tij so\nthat \u03c91i = tij \u03c90i . We must have\n\u0001\n\u03c90i a0 + \u03c91i a1 = a0 \u03b4ji + a1 tij \u03c90i\n\nalso a coframing, as long as a 6= 0. This says precisely that tij has no real eigenvalues.\nAfter this, we have obtained exactly the same structure equations as in equation 1 on page 12. Then we repeat the entire development of those structure equations, identically.\nGiven the resulting structure equations, we wish to construct a local great circle\nfibration out of a portion of X. Consider the circle bundle \u03a3 \u2192 X consisting of\npairs (P, [v]) where P \u2208 X and v \u2208 P \u2282 V with v 6= 0 and as usual [v] means v\nup to positive rescaling. Consider the map \u03a6 : \u03a3 \u2192 S 2n+1 given by \u03a6 (x, [v]) = [v] .\nWe wish to show that \u03a6 is a local diffeomorphism. This \u03a3 is the principal circle\nbundle associated to the complex line bundle O (\u22121)X . The isotropy group of a\npoint of \u03a3 inside the structure group of B \u2192 X is precisely the group \u03931 . We have\nmaps\nB\n\nG\n\n\u03a3\n\nS 2n+1\n\nX.\nWorking out the semibasic 1-forms for the maps G \u2192 S 2n+1 and B \u2192 \u03a3, we\nfind they are identical. Therefore the map is a local diffeomorphism. The fibers\nof B \u2192 \u03a3 are contained in the left translates of the group Gcircle by structure\nequations, so these fibers sit in great circles on the sphere.\n\u0003\nTaking any matrix tij with no real eigenvalues, build the subspace of linear maps\nof the form\n\u0001\na \u2208 R2 7\u2192 a0 \u03b4ji + a1 tij uj\n\n\f34\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\u2217\n\nfor u \u2208 R2n and you have a linear subspace inside R2 \u2297 R2n , which you think of\nas a subspace of some tangent space to a Grassmannian. Then you can take any\nsubmanifold of the Grassmannian with that tangent space at that point, and you\nhave (at least near this point of the submanifold) an elliptic submanifold. So there\nare lots of elliptic submanifolds, locally.\nProposition 1. A submanifold of the Grassmannian is the base of a great circle\nfibration precisely if it is elliptic, compact and connected.\nProof. We have seen that the base of a great circle fibration is elliptic, compact\nf 2 be elliptic, compact and connected. The map\nand connected.

The space \u03a3 is the total space of circle bundle over\nX, so compact. Because the sphere S 2n+1 is simply connected, this forces \u03a6 to\nbe a diffeomorphism. The map S 2n+1 \u2192 X is therefore defined, and satisfies our\nstructure equations, so is a global great circle fibration.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5. Given a great circle fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X, every C 1 small motion of\n2\nf is the base of a great circle fibration. So there are lots of great circle\nX inside Gr\nV\nfibrations, and they admit lots of deformations.

So \u03bdX = T 0,1 X. The great circle fibrations near a given great circle\nfibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X are \"parameterized\" by sections of \u03bdX close to the zero section\n2\nf ). Hence the general great circle\n(for example, by using a Riemannian metric on Gr\nV\nfibration depends on 2n real functions of 2n real variables.\nCorollary 6.

Another approach: consider\npseudocomplex manifolds, as in section 16 on page 46.\n10. Inapplicability of methods to prove the h-principle\nThe relation of ellipticity for a submanifold of the Grassmannian is open but\nnot ample in the sense of Gromov's theory of convex integration. This makes it\nunlikely that convex integration can be applied here.\nBecause the relation is open, it is microflexible. I believe that some deformations\nof elliptic submanifolds nowhere parallel to a given hinge (see section 15 on page 41)\nare not microcompressible (see page 81 of Gromov [7]); if so this makes the sheaf\nof elliptic submanifolds with given hinge not flexible, and then the same is true for\n\n\f35\n\nthe sheaf of all elliptic submanifolds. So probably we can not apply the method of\nsheaves.\nThe ellipticity relation is not the complement of a hypersurface in the 1-jet\nbundle, so we can not apply the method of elimination of singularities. It is not\ndefined by a differential operator, so we can not apply the method of inversion of\ndifferential operators.\n11. The osculating complex structure\nRecall that J0 is our fixed complex structure on V .

Then we can map\nX = B/\u03930 \u2192 G/\u03930\nto this space. When X is the base manifold of a great circle fibration, this map is\nan embedding, since B \u2282 G is embedded. More generally, it is an immersion. We\nwill write for P \u2208 X the corresponding point in JV (i.e. complex structure on V )\nas JP .

We thereby obtain two complex projective subspaces\n\u0001\n\u0001\nCP V 1,0 , CP V 0,1 \u2282 CP (VC ) .\nWe can identify V with V 1,0 by\n\nv \u2208 V 7\u2192 v \u2212\n\nand projectivize this map to identify\n\n\u221a\n\u22121Jv \u2208 V 1,0\n\nCP (V ) = CP V 1,0\n\n\u0001\n\n(where the left hand side means the space of J complex lines in V ). The copies\nof CPn inside CP (VC ) that occur this way are precisely those with no real points,\nnot intersecting RP(V ). So the generic CPn \u2282 CP (VC ) occurs in this way. We will\nnow imitate this story in the context of a general great circle fibration.\nConsider a great circle fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X. Take any x \u2208 X. This x may\n2\nf . There is a complex\nbe identified with an oriented 2-plane x \u2282 V since X \u2282 Gr\nV\nstructure Jx on V for which x is a complex line, defined in section 11 on page 35.\nMap x \u2192 VC by\n\u221a\n\u03c3 : v \u2208 x 7\u2192 v \u2212 \u22121Jx v \u2208 VC .\nSince the fiber of O (\u22121) \u2192 X above x is just x \u2282 V itself, the Sato map \u03c3 is\ndefined on the total space of O (\u22121).\n\u221a\nLemma 16. The Sato map satisfies \u03c3 (Jx v) = \u22121\u03c3(v) for any v \u2208 x \u2208 X.\nProof.\n\n\u221a\n\u03c3 (Jx v) = Jx v \u2212 \u22121Jx Jx v\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001\n= \u22121 v \u2212 \u22121Jx v .\n\n\u0003\n\nAs a consequence, \u03c3 takes the Jx complex line x to a complex line \u03c3(x) in VC .\nDefine the Sato map \u03c3 : X \u2192 CP (VC ) to be the map that assigns to x the line\n\u03c3(x). This gives a morphism of bundles\nO (\u22121)X\nX\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\n\nO (\u22121)CP(VC )\nCP (VC )\n\nwhich is complex linear on the fibers and SL(V )-equivariant. The action of SL(V )\non CP (VC ) is by biholomorphisms (indeed, by projective automorphisms).\nLemma 17. The Sato map X \u2192 CP (VC ) is injective.\n\n\f39\n\nProof. Suppose that \u03c3(x) = \u03c3(y). Then for any v \u2208 x and w \u2208 y we must find \u03c3(v)\nand \u03c3(w) on the same complex line in VC . Therefore,\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03c3(v) = v\u2212 \u22121Jx v = a + b \u22121 w \u2212 \u22121Jy w = (a + bJy ) w+ \u22121 (b \u2212 aJy ) w\n\nwhich implies that\n\nv = (a + bJy ) w \u2208 y.\n\nBut the fiber above y is Jy invariant, so v and w lie on the same great circle fiber,\nand therefore x = y.\n\u0003\nLet us look at the locus of points z \u2208 VC so that z \u2227 z\u0304 = 0 \u2208 \u039b1,1 (VC ). This\nprojects to a variety \u2206 \u2282 CP (VC ) . We can parameterize this variety as\n\u221a follows: a\nvector z \u2208 VC satisfies z \u2227 z\u0304 precisely when it has the form z = v + \u22121w with\nv and w belonging to the same real line in V . Multiplying by a suitable complex\nnumber, we can get z = v \u2208 V . So we can identify each element of \u2206 with a vector\nin V up to real multiples: \u2206 = RP (V ) i.e. \u2206 consists in the real points of CP (VC ) .\nLemma 18. The space SV = CP (VC ) \\RP(V ) is canonically identified with the\nspace of pairs (P, j) where P \u2282 V is a 2-plane, and j : P \u2192 P is a complex\nstructure.\nProof. Membership in RP(V ) is precisely given by the equation z\u221a\u2227 z\u0304 = 0 and\ntherefore the solutions in VC consist precisely in vectors z = v + \u22121w so that\nv \u2227 w = 0, i.e.\u0002 v, w\n\u221a \u2208 V\u0003 belong to the same real line. Therefore away from\nRP(V ), points\nv\n+\n\u0003 \u22121w \u2208 CP (VC ) \\RP(V ) map to 2-planes P = [v \u2227 w]. To\n\u0002\n\u221a\na point v + \u22121w \u2208 SV = CP (VC ) \\RP(V ), attach the complex structure j\nwhich maps jv = \u2212w, jw = v. On the other hand, given an oriented\nP\n\u0001\n\u221a 2-plane\nwith complex structure j and a point v \u2208 P \\0, map it to C\u00d7 v \u2212 \u22121jv . This\ngives continuous maps in each direction between SV and the space of 2-planes with\ncomplex structures, and these maps are easily seen to be inverses of one another.\nSince the space of 2-planes with complex structures is a homogeneous space of\nSL(V ), and the maps are SL(V )-invariant, both sides are homogeneous spaces and\nthese maps are equivariant diffeomorphisms.\n\u0003\nf 2 is thus the set of complex structures on a given oriented\nEach fiber of SV \u2192 Gr\nV\n2-plane P , forming a copy of the hyperbolic plane. We can look at the same 2-plane\nP with the opposite orientation, and find another such hyperbolic plane. These\ntwo planes are glued together inside CP (VC ) along the real locus of points of the\nprojectivization of P . In other words, the points of these two hyperbolic planes are\n2\nf are\nthe complex points of the projectivization of P . Thus the fibers of SV \u2192 Gr\nV\nopen subsets (\"halves\") of the complex points of real projective lines in CP (VC ) .\nWe can write out the structure equations for G \u2192 SV : the 1-forms \u03a9p0 , \u03a9p\u03040 , \u03a90\u03040 are\nsemibasic (because they are independent on G but vanish on the structure group)\nand they satisfy\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb q\uf8f6\n\uf8eb p\uf8f6\n\uf8eb p\n\uf8eb p\uf8f6\n\u03a9q \u2212 \u03b4qp \u03a900\n\u03a9pq\u0304\n0\n\u03a90\n\u03a90\n\u03a90\u0304\np\u0304\np\u0304\np\u0304\nq\u0304\n0\u0304\np\u0304\n0\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\u03a9\n0\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u2212\n\u03b4\n(13) d \u03a90 = \u2212\n\u2227 \u03a90 + \u03a90 \u2227 \u03a9p\u03040\u0304 \uf8f8 .\nq\u0304\nq\u0304 0\nq\n0\n\u03a90\u03040\n\u03a90\u03040\n\u03a90\u03040\u0304 \u2212 \u03a900\n\u03a90\u0304q\u0304\n\u03a90\u0304q\n{z\n}\n|\ntorsion\n\n\f40\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nFrom this expression, we find that the 1-forms \u03a9p0 , \u03a9p\u03040 , \u03a90\u03040 vary in a complex linear\nrepresentation under the action of the structure group. Declaring them to be (1, 0)forms for an almost complex structure, the torsion consists of (1, 1) forms, so the\nalmost complex structure is a complex structure: SV is a complex manifold.\nLemma 19. The complex structure on SV given by the structure equations 13 on the preceding page\nis the same as that given by the embedding SV \u2282 CP (VC ).\n\nProof. The generic CPn \u2282 CP (VC ) lies in SV and occurs as the base of a Hopf\nfibration. From the structure equations of a Hopf fibration we see that these are\ncomplex submanifolds in that complex structure. But they are obviously complex\nsubmanifolds in the CP (VC ) complex structure. The complex structures on these\nCPn submanifolds agree, as we can see directly looking at the construction of the\nHopf fibration. Since the tangent planes to these CPn form an open subset of n\ndimensional complex tangent planes, they force both complex structures on SV to\nagree.\n\u0003\n\nThe two zeroes in these structure equations, in the expressions for d\u03a9p0 and d\u03a9p\u03040 ,\nshow that this manifold is fibered by complex curves, defined by the equations\n2\nf since the 1-forms\n\u03a9p = \u03a9p\u0304 = 0 and these are of course the fibers of SV \u2192 Gr\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\nV\n\nf is not a holomorphic map for\n\u03a9p0 , \u03a9p\u03040 are semibasic for this map.

The complex\nline bundle O (\u22121)X is the pullback of the complex line bundle O (\u22121)CP(VC ) by \u03c3.\nThe image of the Sato map determines the great circle fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X.\n2\n\n2\n\nf is an embedding, and the map SV \u2192 Gr\nf is an SL(V )Proof. The map X \u2192 Gr\nV\nV\nequivariant fiber bundle.\n\u0003\nCorollary 9. The \"hyperplanes\" in X which were discussed in section 13 on page 37\nare the intersections of X with complex hyperplanes in CP (VC ).\nProof. This is just saying that since O (\u22121)X is the pullback of O (\u22121)CP(VC ) , therefore the dual of the pullback, i.e. O (1)X , is the pullback of the dual.\n\u0003\nConsider the requirement that the 1-forms used to cut out the hyperplanes are\nreal valued. Take a real valued 1-form \u03be \u2208 V \u2217 and split it into complex linear and\nconjugate linear parts on VC by\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03be 1,0 v + \u22121w = \u03be(v) + \u22121\u03be(w)\n\nand\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u22121w = \u03be(v) \u2212 \u22121\u03be(w).\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThen the \u03be 1,0 part cuts out a hyperplane of v + \u22121w so that \u03be(v) + \u22121\u03be(w) = 0,\ni.e. where both \u03be(v) and \u03be(w) vanish.\nThe Sato map is given by taking elements of VC\u2217 and using them as sections of\nO (\u22121)X and then using that to make an embedding\n\u03be 0,1 v +\n\nP 7\u2192 [\u03c30 (P ) : * * * : \u03c32n (P )] .\n\n\f41\n\n15.

Any complex structure on P arises this way, for\na suitable choice of tangent space by SL(V )-equivariance. Hence if we can slightly\nperturb the tangent planes of two great circle fibrations at their intersection points,\nthen they will be nowhere parallel. Another way to phrase parallelism: points of\nparallelism are intersection points in the image of the Sato map inside CP (VC ).\nParallelism of great circle fibrations X0 , X1 at a point x clearly implies that the\nosculating complex structures J1,x , J2,x agree on the 2-plane P = Px , and so\n0 = det (J1,x \u2212 J2,x ) .\n\nIn particular, if we can find some constant complex structure J \u2208 V \u2217 \u2297 V whose\n2\nf V satisfies\nHopf fibration base XJ = CPnJ \u2282 Gr\n0 6= det (J \u2212 Jx )\n\nfor all Jx \u2208 K, i.e. for all osculating complex structures to X then XJ and X are\nnowhere parallel.\nf 2 .

If f is a local diffeomorphism of V \\0 then it descends to a diffeomorphism\nX \u2192 XJ \u2032 = CPnJ\u2032 to a Hopf fibration, linear on the fibers of the Hopf fibration.\nProof. Take a vector v \u2208 V \\0 and let x = hv, Jx vi \u2208 X be the associated oriented\n2-plane. If f (v) = 0 then one easily checks that Jx v = Jv and so X and XJ are\nparallel at x.

By dimension count, we see that these XJ \u2282 CP (VC ) (which are in one\nto one correspondence with complex structures J on V ) have the same dimension\nas the space of all CPn linear subspaces in CP (VC ), so they form an open subset.\nIndeed the XJ subspaces are precisely those CPn linear subspaces with no real\npoints on them.\n\u0003\n\nCPn+1\n\nX\nCPn0\n\n\f45\n\nNow that we can map the base of our great circle fibration to a complex projective\nspace, we have to map the great circles to the fibers of the Hopf fibration. Consider\nfirst how to do this for a pair Hopf fibrations, given by complex structures J1 and\nJ2 . We take any other Hopf fibration, given by a complex structure J0 , so that if\nthe associated fibrations are S 2n+1 \u2192 Xk for k = 0, 1, 2, then X0 \u2282 CP (VC ) will\nnot be parallel to X1 or to X2 , i.e. X0 is a hinge for X1 and also for X2 . Of course,\nthese Xk are all CPn linear subspaces inside CP2n+1 = CP (VC ) given by linear\nequations\n\u221a \u0001\nXk = Jk = \u22121 .\n\nOur map X1 \u2192 X2 is constructed by taking all linear CPn+1 subspaces containing X0 and matching the point CPn+1 \u2229 X1 to the point CPn+1 \u2229 X2 .\nFirst, we need to lift the entire picture up to a linear picture in VC . Then we will\nsee what is happening in V itself. Up in VC we have 3 complex linear subspaces\nV0 , V1 , V2 , all isomorphic to Cn+1 , which are just the preimages of the X0 , X1 , X2\nlinear subspaces in CP (VC ) . Another way to say this:\n\u221a\n\b\nVk = v | Jk v = \u22121v .\n\nSince the V0 has no vectors in common with V1 or with V2 , every vector in VC can\nbe written as a combination w = w0 + w1 of vectors from V0 and V1 . The vectors\nin Vk are of the form\n\u221a\nv \u2212 \u22121Jk v\nfor vectors v \u2208 V . The equation\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nv2 \u2212 \u22121J2 v2 = v0 \u2212 \u22121J0 v0 + v1 \u2212 \u22121J1 v1\n\nfor v0 , v1 , v2 \u2208 V breaks into real and imaginary parts:\nv2 = v0 + v1\nJ2 v2 = J0 v0 + J1 v1\n\nand has the solution\n\u22121\n\nv0 = (J2 \u2212 J0 )\n\nv2 = v0 + v1\n\n(J1 \u2212 J2 ) v1\n\n\u221a\nso taking v1 \u2208 V \u2192 v2 \u2208 V by a linear isomorphism, taking the \u22121 eigenspace of\nJ1 to that of J2 . The equation J2 v2 = J0 v0 + J1 v1 ensures us that this map takes\nJ1 v1 to J2 v2 . So it is a complex linear map\n(V, J1 ) \u2192 (V, J2 ) .\n\nBy construction it matches the 2-planes P1 and P2 in V , just looking back at the\nconstruction of the Sato map.\nAs before, we can apply the same idea to a great circle fibration as follows: we\ntake S 2n+1 \u2192 X our great circle fibration, and S 2n+1 \u2192 X2 a Hopf fibration, given\nby a complex structure J2 . Now we pick another Hopf fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X0 given\nby a complex structure J0 , so that X0 is nowhere parallel to X and to X2 . For\neach 2-plane P \u2208 X we take the osculating complex structure JP and use the above\nprocess to produce a complex linear map (V, JP ) \u2192 (V, J2 ) . This will map P to a\n2-plane P2 complex linearly:\n(V, P, JP ) \u2192 (V, P2 , J2 ) .\n\n\f46\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nHence it identifies the great circle fibrations. We have proven:\nTheorem 4. If a great circle fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X admits a hinge, then the base\nmanifold X is diffeomorphic to CPn by a diffeomorphism which lifts to a diffeomorphism S 2n+1 \u2192 S 2n+1 linear on the fibers. For each choice of hinge XJ0 \u2282 CP (VC )\nfor X we obtain an isomorphism\nS 2n+1\n\nS 2n+1\n\nX\n\nCPn\n\nidentifying the great circle fibration with a Hopf fibration. This isomorphism depends smoothly on the choice of hinge.\nCorollary 10. Given any two great circle fibrations S 2n+1 \u2192 X0 and S 2n+1 \u2192 X1 ,\nf 2 are homotopic\nboth admitting a hinge, the embedded submanifolds X0 , X1 \u2282 Gr\nV\n\n2\n\nf .\ninside Gr\nV\n\nProof. We pick a hinge for each Xj and an orientation preserving linear isomorphism identifying the hinges. The linear isomorphism lies on a path inside the\ngeneral linear group. So we can assume that the two hinges are the same. Deform\nX0 to X1 along the straight lines contained in each CPn+1 \\CPn0 = Cn+1 . Then\n2\nf .\ntake the image in Gr\n\u0003\nV\n\n16. Nonlinear J: twisted complex structures\n\nA great circle fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X determines a 2-plane P through each point\nv \u2208 V \\0, and a complex structure JP : V \u2192 V for which P is a complex line.\nDefine the map JX : V \\0 \u2192 V \\0 by JX v = JP v. Clearly JX is a smooth map, and\n2\nsatisfies JX\n= \u22121. The map JX is linear precisely if the great circle fibration is a\nHopf fibration.\nA twisted complex structure is a map J : V \\0 \u2192 V \\0 which\n(1) is continuous,\n(2) satisfies J 2 = \u22121\n(3) leaves invariant each 2-plane span hv, Jvi and\n(4) is linear on those 2-planes.\nA real vector space V equipped with a twisted complex structure is a twisted complex\nvector space. (Twisted complex structures were discovered simultaneously by the\nauthor [12] and by Jean-Claude Sikorav [15].)\nExtend our twisted complex structures from V \\0 to V by defining J0 = 0, so\nthat J : V \u2192 V is a homeomorphism, but not differentiable at 0 unless J is linear,\ni.e. a complex structure. A twisted complex structure is smooth if J is smooth on\nV \\0. Note that a twisted complex structure extends to 0 to be smooth at 0 just\nwhen it is linear.\nGiven a smooth or topological twisted complex structure J, define a smooth or\n2\nf to be the set of oriented\ntopological great circle fibration by taking X(J) \u2282 Gr\nV\n2-planes of the form hv, JX vi for v \u2208 V , oriented by setting v \u2227 JX v to be positive,\ntaking the great circles in S 2n+1 = (V \\0)/R+ to be the quotients by R+ of the\nJ-invariant 2-planes.\n\n\f47\n\nLemma 23. For any smooth great circle fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X, X (JX ) = X.\nProof. The 2-planes which are JX -invariant are precisely those belonging to X, with\nthe required orientation. So it is the same submanifold of the Grassmannian. \u0003\nA twisted complex structure J is a pseudocomplex structure if it satisfies J = JX\nfor S 2n+1 \u2192 X a great circle fibration.\nLemma 24. The generic smooth twisted complex structure J is not pseudocomplex,\ni.e. JX(J) 6= J.\nProof. Let X = X(J) and J \u2032 = JX(J) . Clearly J \u2032 leaves a 2-plane invariant precisely when J does. These 2-planes have the same orientation, so they determine\nthe same great circle fibration, X. Each of J and J \u2032 also determine sections of\n2\nf . Recall that SV is the space of pairs (P, j) so that P \u2282 V is a 2-plane and\nSV \u2192 Gr\nV\nj : P \u2192 P is a complex structure on P . Define \u03c3J : X \u2192 SV by \u03c3J (P ) = (P, J|P )\n2\nf over\nrestricting J to P . But we can vary J to an arbitrary section of SV \u2192 Gr\nV\nthe same X, while J \u2032 is fixed by the choice of X.\n\u0003\nCorollary 11. The space of smooth twisted complex structures retracts to the space\nof great circle fibrations, i.e. to the space of pseudocomplex structures.\nProof. Indeed, using the notation of the preceding lemma, J = J \u2032 precisely when\nthe sections X \u2192 SV |X agree. Note that these are disk bundles, so the space of J\nwith fixed X(J) is contractible. Or, more canonically, just take J \u2192 X(J).\n\u0003\nIf vector spaces V0 , V1 have twisted complex structures J0 , J1 , then the sum of\nthese is V = V0 \u2295 V1 with twisted complex structure\nJ (v0 , v1 ) = (J0 v0 , J1 v1 ) .\nAn obvious result:\nProposition 2. The sum of twisted complex vector spaces is twisted complex. The\nsum is smooth just when one of the summands is linear, i.e. a complex structure.\nIt appears that Yang's proof of the topological Blaschke conjecture for Blaschke\nmanifolds with the cohomology of complex projective spaces involves proving that\nevery such Blaschke manifold is the base manifold of a sum of two great circle\nfibrations.\n17. The space M\nConsider the homogeneous SL(V ) space MV which consists of choices of pairs\n(P, J) of 2-plane P \u2282 V and complex structure J : V \u2192 V so that P is a complex\nJ-line. We have described a map X \u2192 MV from the base manifold X of any great\ncircle fibration S 2n+1 \u2192 X. Indeed the structure group of our bundle B \u2192 X is\nprecisely the isotropy group of a point of MV . There are obvious maps\nMV\nf2\nGr\nV\n\nJV .\n\n\f48\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nThe fibers of the map MV \u2192 JV are copies of CPn . From the structure equations,\nwe see that MV is a complex manifold. In fact it is possible to see this from a\ndifferent point of view: since the complex structures on V are identified with the\ncomplex linear subspaces W \u2282 VC with no real points, i.e. W \u2229 V = 0, this is an\nn+1\nopen subset of the Grassmannian Grn+1\nC,2n+2 . Above GrC,2n+2 we have the universal\nn+1\nn+1\nbundle U \u2192 GrC,2n+2 whose fiber above W \u2208 GrC,2n+2 is W itself. Projectivizing\nthis bundle, we have the bundle\nCP(U) \u2192 Grn+1\nC,2n+2\n\nof complex projective spaces. A choice of (P, J) \u2208 MV is precisely a choice of\ncomplex subspace W \u2208 Grn+1\nC,2n+2 not containing any real vectors: W \u2229 V = 0, and\na choice of complex line inside W : the line consisting of the vectors\n\u221a\nv \u2212 \u22121Jv\nfor v \u2208 P . Consequently, MV is just the pullback\nMV\n\nCP(U)\n\nJV\n\nGrn+1\nC,2n+2 .\n\nWe can also identify MV with the homogeneous space\nMV = SL(V ) /\u03930 .\nSince a great circle fibration\nS1\n\nS 2n+1\nX 2n\n\ngives rise to a right principle \u03930 bundle\n\u03930\n\nB\n\nX\nwith B \u2282 SL(V ), we have\n\u03930\n\nB\n\nSL(V )\n\nX\n\nMV .\n\n\u03930\n\nConsider also the map\nX \u2192 MV \u2192 JV \u2282 Grn+1\nC,2n+2 .\nPicking a hinge, i.e. a choice of complex subspace W0 \u2208 Grn+1\nC,2n+2 \u2229JV which is\nn+1\ntransverse to every complex subspace W \u2208 GrC,2n+2 \u2229JV arising as osculating\ncomplex structure to X, we can then trivialize the universal bundle over the part of\n\n\f49\n\nGrn+1\nC,2n+2 consisting of subspaces transverse to W0 . We do that by taking complex\ncoordinates z, w on VC so that the complex n + 1 plane z = 0 is the hinge.\u0001 Then\nall of the other complex n + 1 planes have the form w = pz so that p = pP\nQ is our\nPl\u00fccker coordinate system. Given two n + 1 planes, say with Pl\u00fccker coordinates\np0 and p1 , use the map\n(z, p0 z) 7\u2192 (z, p1 z)\n\nto identify them. This is a complex linear map, so it identifies complex lines with\ncomplex lines.\nOn X \u2282 M , map\n(z, pz) \u2208 X 7\u2192 (z, 0) \u2208 X0\n\nwhere X0 is the subspace associated to some Hopf fibration. This map takes complex lines to complex lines, and therefore identifies the complex structures on the\n2-planes belonging to X with those on X0 .\nX\nCP(U)\n\nGrC (n + 1, 2n + 2)\n18. Further remarks\nFor applications to pseudoholomorphic curves, one would like to define a concept\nof totally real subspace R \u2282 V , dimR R = n+1. This should be precisely a subspace\nof V which, thought of as a great n sphere in S 2n+1 , has no great circles in it from\nour fibration. Generic R should have this property.\nThe general story of great sphere fibrations (the topological Blaschke theory)\ncan probably be studied as follows: each Hopf fibration\nSk\n\nSN\n\nXHopf\nhas a symmetry group \u0393 \u2282 SL(N + 1, R), and a point of XHopf has an isotropy\nsubgroup \u03930 \u2282 \u0393. This gives an embedding of homogeneous SL(N + 1, R) spaces\nXHopf = \u0393/\u03930 \u2282 SL(N + 1, R) /\u03930 .\nThen SL(N + 1, R) acts on this picture to move the embedded submanifold around\nin a fibration, with base SL(N + 1, R) /\u0393.\n\u0393/\u03930\n\nSL(N + 1, R) /\u03930\nSL(N + 1, R) /\u0393.\n\n\f50\n\nBENJAMIN MCKAY\n\nNow any great sphere fibration\nSk\n\nSN\n\nX\nprobably gives, via moving frame calculations similar to those above, an embedding\nX \u2282 SL(N + 1, R) /\u03930\n\nwhich is \"close\" to vertical. Locally trivializing the fiber bundle\n\u0393/\u03930\n\nSL(N + 1, R) /\u03930\nSL(N + 1, R) /\u0393\n\nin some \"nice\" way, one will probably find that this gives an explicit diffeomorphism\nX \u2192 XHopf .\nTaking M a manifold and SM = (T M \\0) /R+ , the tangent sphere bundle, one\ncould consider a great sphere fibration of each sphere in SM . Call this a Blaschke\nsystem. We can interpret such a system as a first order system of partial differential\nequations, so that a solution to such an equation is an immersed submanifold of M\nwhose tangent spaces project via T M \\0 \u2192 SM to be great spheres belonging to\nour fibration. If there are involutive differential equations constructible in this way,\nwith a suitable notion of taming, then this will provide a theory of pseudoquaternionic curves and pseudo-octave curves, and perhaps a theory of Gromov\u2013Witten\ninvariants for hyper-K\u00e4hler and octavic spaces.\nFor applications to elliptic partial differential equations, the most important\nresult one would like to prove is probably the existence of a taming symplectic\nstructure. Here that means an element \u03c9 \u2208 \u039b2 (V \u2217 ) so that \u03c9 > 0 on each 2-plane\nin X. In local complex coordinates z, w on V , we can write 2-planes as\ndwi = pi dz + q i dz\u0304\nand then the symplectic form\n\u03c9=\nbecomes on that 2-plane\n\n\u221a\n\u0011\n\u22121 \u0010\ndz \u2227 dz\u0304 + dwi \u2227 dw\u012b\n2\n\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u03c9=\n1 + |p|2 \u2212 |q|2 dz \u2227 dz\u0304.\n2\n\n2\n\nf . When we look\nTherefore the null 2-planes for \u03c9 form a real hyperquadric in Gr\nV\nup in SV we find two more dimensions to the space, and to the subspace of null\n2-planes. It is still a real hyperquadric. The problem is then to show that this\nhypersurface does not intersect the base manifold of a great circle fibration, after\nsuitable linear transformation.\nIn studying families of great circle fibrations, it would be helpful to have a\nretraction from the space of great circle fibrations to the space of complex structures,\ni.e. Hopf fibrations. Such a retraction is most likely to be found using a parabolic\nheat flow.\n\n\f51\n\nRight principal bundle\nB \u2192 S 2n+1\n\nSemibasic 1-forms Structure group\n\u001a\u0012 0\n\u0013\n\u001b\ng0 gq0\np\n0\u0304\n0\n0\n\u03930 =\n; g0 \u2208 R\n\u03a90 , \u03a90\u0304 + \u03a90\n0 gqp\n\u03a9p0\n\nB\u2192X\n\nG \u2192 S 2n+1\n2\n\n\u03931 =\n\n\u03a9p0 , \u03a900\u0304\n\n\u0012 0\ng0\n0\n\ngq0\ngqp\n\n\u0013\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\ng00 g10 gj0\nG0 = \uf8ed 0 g11 gj1 \uf8f8\n0 g1i gji\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 0\ng0 g10 gj0\nGcircle = \uf8edg01 g11 gj1 \uf8f8\n0 0 gji\n\nf\nG \u2192 Gr\nV\n\n\u03a9p0 , \u03a9p0\u0304\n\nG \u2192 JV\n\n\u03a900\u0304 , \u03a9p0\u0304 , \u03a90p\u0304 , \u03a9pq\u0304\n\nGL(V, J0 )\n\nG \u2192 SV\n\n\u03a900\u0304 , \u03a9p0 , \u03a9p0\u0304\n\n\uf8eb 0\ng0\n\uf8edg01\n0\n\nG \u2192 MV\n\n\u03a9p0 , \u03a9p\u03040 , \u03a90\u03040 , \u03a90\u0304p , \u03a9p\u0304q\n\n\u03930\n\n\u2212g01\ng00\n0\n\n\uf8f6\ngj0\ngj1 \uf8f8\ngji\n\nTable 1.
