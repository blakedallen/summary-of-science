It is known\nthat, with few important exceptions, the amorphous and crystalline phases of the same\nmaterial do not differ very much magnetically. In the last three decades, the discovery\nand large scale investigation of rapidly solidified alloys have made possible a new scenario\nin basic and applied magnetism. The unusual behaviour of the bulk metallic magnetic\nglasses (BMMGs) - formed by supercooling the liquid state of certain metallic magnetic\nalloys - usually occurs for systems containing atoms that exhibit a well-known sensitivity\nto the immediate neighbourhood [1, 2]. However, despite the large number of technological\napplications of BMMGs, the detailed origin of the links between structural and magnetic\nproperties has yet to be established, but is strongly dependent on the atomic short-range\norder [3].\nNowadays, atomic-scale simulations of solids based on interatomic potentials are routinely\nperformed to explore the short-range order of BMMGs [4, 5] as a precursor to the study of\nthe magnetic ordering, which is evidently beyond such methods. However, the construction\nof realistic n-body potentials is mandatory to any simulations. When applied to metals and\nalloys, several major methods and extensions of construction of such potentials have been\nestablished from density functional theory, i.e., the embedded-atom method (EAM) [6] or\ntight-binding second moment approximation, i.e., the Finnis-Sinclair (FS) model [7] and\nrelated models [8, 9]. The two models have very similar computational requirements, and\nthe names are often used interchangably, however there are some distinctions which come to\nthe fore when considering multicomponent alloys [10]. Because of the parameters involved\nin these model potentials, the EAM method was first used to study simple metals in their\nrelevant crystalline structures [11, 12]. Extensions to binary alloys were formulated [13] with\nspecial attention to hcp-fcc [14] and hcp-bcc [15] systems. Because they are often based on\nspin-less approximations of electronic density, such effective model potentials traditionally\nneglect the magnetic ordering [7, 10, 16, 17]. Notable exceptions have been published\nrecently by Dudarev et al. [18] and Ackland et al. [19, 20], but such methods are still in their\ninfancy. Even in spin-less schemes, these effective potentials may be able to represent the\ncompositional ordering which is, at least in the localised magnetism picture, a prerequisite\nfor understanding the magnetic behaviour. Existing magnetic potentials concentrate on the\n2\n\n\fone-site magnetism, for which the energetics reduces in form to a simple embedded-atomtype potential, explaining the success of standard EAM schemes on magnetic materials.\nSupercooled Co1\u2212x Nbx and Co1\u2212x Zrx magnetic metallic glasses in the cobalt-rich region\nrepresent test cases for both hcp-bcc and hcp-hcp metal sub-systems. These compounds\nhave been experimentally studied because they are strong ferromagnets, as revealed by a\nhigh value of the exchange constant [21]. Consequently, large short-range compositional\ninhomogeneities should induce significant variations of the long-range magnetic order. The\npresent work considers both the construction of embedded-atom potentials for such materials, as well as the application to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to assess one\nof the issues in the large field of these BMMGs, namely short-range order quasicrystallinity.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODOLOGY FOR POTENTIALS\n\nIn the FS method, the total internal energy E of a N-atom system and the electron\ndensity, \u03c1(Ri ), for an atom located at Ri due to all other atoms are given as;\nN\nN\nX\n1 X\n\u03c6(rij ) \u2212\nF (\u03c1(Ri)),\nE=\n2\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\ni,j,(i6=j)\n\n\u03c1(Ri ) =\n\nN\nX\n\nf (rij ),\n\n(2)\n\nj6=i\n\nwhere f (rij ) is the electron density at atom i due to atom j as a function of the distance\nbetween them, rij = kRi \u2212Rj k is the separation distance between atoms i and j, F (\u03c1(Ri )) is\nthe energy to embed atom i in an electron density \u03c1(Ri ), and \u03c6(rij ) is a two-body potential\nbetween atoms i and j. As long as an angular independent formulation is considered, the\nelectron density is a radial function only. For an alloy model, an embedding function, F , has\nto be specified for each atomic species supplemented by an atomic electron-density function,\nf , and a two-body potential, \u03c6, specified for each possible combination of atomic species.\nFor uncompressed metals, Gupta [22] and Tom\u00e0nek et al. [23] have shown that the host\nelectron density can be represented as an exponentially decreasing function of the distance\nto better account for atomic relaxation near impurities and surfaces. In this approximation,\nf is given as;\nf (r) = fe exp(\u2212\u03c7(r/re \u2212 1)),\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere fe is a scaling factor determined by the cohesive energy, Ec , and the atomic volume,\nre is the nearest-neighbour distance in the relevant pair of atoms and \u03c7 is an adjustable\nparameter. Analysing the interatomic interactions in effective-medium theory, Jacobsen et\nal. [24] have shown that if an exponential form is chosen for the density function, then the\ninteratomic potential, \u03c6, should also be an exponential function of the distance. In this\nstudy, the interatomic potentials of all the pairs considered are defined by a potential of the\nform;\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nA exp(\u2212r/r0 ) 0 \u2264 r \u2264 r1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n5\n\uf8f2X\n\u03c6(r) =\nai r i\nr1 \u2264 r \u2264 rm ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ni=0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\nrm \u2264 r,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the interaction is designed so as to go smoothly to zero at the distance rm according\nto a polynomial spline function. The potentials are constructed subject to the constraints\nthat the radial functions and their first and second derivatives must be continuous at the\nboundary points, and also that the function must have a stationary point at rm . Once\nA, r0 , r1 and rm are fixed, this procedure ensures that the coefficients, {ai }, are uniquely\ndetermined by solving a simple 6 \u00d7 6 linear system of equations. These coefficients are\nreported in Table I for completeness. For all the pairs of atoms, r1 = 2.5\u00c5 is kept fixed\nand corresponds to a typical radius where the stiff repulsive part of the potential ends in\nmetals [25, 26, 27]. Because of the screening in metals, the stationary point is located at\nleast between the second and third nearest neighbours for the lowest energy crystal phases\nas previously noted [28]. Since the embedding energy is assumed to be independent of the\nsource of the electron density and the hopping integrals are a function only of a radial\ndistance between atoms, the embedding functional F is taken as\nF [\u03c1(r)] =\n\np\n\n\u03c1(r).\n\n(5)\n\nThis functional form gives a band energy proportional to the square root of the second\nmoment of the electron density of states [22]. However, moments of higher order cannot\nbe expressed in such a simple analytical form and a more complex method must be applied\n[29]. Johnson [13] has considered that since the electron density at any location is taken\nas a linear superposition of atomic electron densities, this function should be taken directly\nfrom monoatomic models with a relative scaling factor between elements for an alloy model.\n4\n\n\fOn the other hand, Finnis and Sinclair [7] and Cleri and Rosato [30] have considered mixed\npair electron-density functions not necessarily connected to the atomic ones, removing the\nalloy scaling factors.\nFor hcp-Co and hcp-Zr, the parameters for the atomic electron-density and the interatomic potential are fitted in order to reproduce the experimental cohesive energies, the\nunit cell parameters and the five independent elastic constants of these systems as given by\nCleri and Rosato [30]. Moreover, cell parameters and elastic constants of fcc-Co and bccZr are also included during the fitting procedure as taken from references [31, 32, 33] and\nreferences therein. Generally, for a small cutoff distance the largest number of interacting\nneighbours per atom in the crystalline structure leads to the more stable phase. Ducastelle\n[34] has shown that in the second-moment approximation, with interactions restricted to the\nnearest neighbours, the cohesive energy for the hcp and fcc phases is the same and the c/a\nratio is equal to the ideal value. Hence, it is necessary to go up to at least the fourth-moment\napproximation to discriminate between the fcc and hcp phases and to give a value of c/a\np\ndifferent from 2 2/3. In our case, since the c/a ratios are not taken to be the ideal one and\nbecause the potentials have a very short range, the cutoff distance of atomic electron density\nshould be larger than that of the potential. So for the electron density, the cutoff distance\nis taken to be 4.87\u00c5, thus including up to seven shells of neighbours within hcp-Co, and\nthree for both hcp-Zr and bcc-Nb, which are all the stable phases for each pure element. A\ncheck is also performed to ensure that at least three shells of neighbours have been included\nfor the high pressure/high temperature structures since this is necessary to keep the relative\nenergies of each phases in the correct order [33]. Moreover, it has been observed that in\nincorporating the elastic constants of the bcc-Zr phase in the database, the fitting of both\nthe cell parameters and cohesive energy of the hcp-Zr is rather poor with this cutoff radius,\nso only the hcp-Co, fcc-Co, hcp-Zr and bcc-Nb elastic constants are included during the\nfit. For Nb, the cohesive energy, the lattice parameter and the three independent elastic\nconstants of the bcc-Nb phase are taken from reference [35] and the theoretical fcc-Nb cell\nparameter and cohesive energy are also included [36]. No elastic constants of the fcc-Nb\nwere found to incorporate into the training set of observables.\nThe selection of the functional form taken in Eq.(1)-(2) is extended to AB alloys based\non the second-moment form that has been applied to Zr [33, 37]. The embedding function,\natomic electron-density function and two-body potential are assumed to be of the same\n5\n\n\fform as in Eq.(3)-(4), with \u03c6AB and \u03c6BA assumed to be equal. The alloy potentials and\natomic electron-density functions are determined independently of the monoatomic counterparts if sufficient data are available. However, it is known that for equilibrium immiscible\nsystems it is a challenging task to fit cross potentials, since there is often insufficient experimental data related to the respective alloy compounds. In order to circumnavigate\nthis problem, density functional calculations have been performed on selected intermetallic structures using the Quantum-ESPRESSO package [38]. For these calculations, nonlocal ultrasoft pseudo-potentials are employed in combination with a plane-wave basis set.\nThe generalized-gradient approximation, as parametrized by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof\n[39], is selected for the exchange and correlation term. For the Brillouin zone sampling, a\n12\u00d712\u00d712 Monkhorst-Pack mesh is used for the k-point summation in the self-consistent\ncalculations [40] for all the primitive cells, which leads to converged structural parameters\nto within 0.1% of the cell parameter. Thus the lattice constants and cohesive energies of\nseveral Co-(Zr,Nb) and Zr-Nb crystalline structures reported in Table (III) are obtained and\nthen included in the fitting procedure for the Co-(Zr,Nb) and Zr-Nb cross potentials and\natomic electron-density functions.

First, the densities\nand potentials are derived for the simple metals. Once the corresponding parameters are\nobtained, the fit is applied to selected binary metals for cross-densities and potentials without\naltering the terms for the simple metals. The same cutoff radius is kept constant during all\nthe steps and the calculations are performed within the GULP computer code [41].\nIn Table II, a list of some basic physical properties as computed by the present set\nof potentials and the corresponding experimental values are shown for Co, Nb and Zr.\nThe fit correctly reproduces the structures and properties of hcp-Co, fcc-Co, hcp-Zr and\nbcc-Nb. The absolute average percentage difference between calculation and experiment is\nfound to be 0.6%, 0.7% and 8%, for the cell parameters, cohesive energies elastic constants,\nrespectively. However, the elastic constants of fcc-Nb produced a negative Young's modulus,\nas expected, in this excited locally unstable structural phase [44]. The properties of bccZr are reproduced with a sufficient accuracy, except for the C44 elastic constant where the\nlargest percentage error of 45% occurs. The potentials fitted by Willaime et al. [33] also\nexhibit such a discrepancy though with a much larger error. This may be corrected by\nrelaxing the constraint of the square-root form of the embedding functional and considering\nmore neighbours [12] or by including explicit angularly dependent terms in the potentials\nat a cost of additional parameters [45].\nIn Table III, a list of some basic physical properties fitted from these potentials and\nthe corresponding ab initio calculated values for selected binary alloys is shown. The B2,\nC15 and L12 denominations are relative to the strukturbericht structural types classification\n[48], such as B2 is the CsCl structure type, C15 is the MgCu2 structure type and L12 is\nthe Cu3 Au type. The fitting procedure appears to correctly reproduce the ab initio derived\nphase stability order and lattice parameters. However, the absolute cohesive energies are\nreproduced to a lesser extent. This may be also improved consistently by increasing the\ncutoff radius on Zr and Nb electron density terms, which includes more neighbours in the\ntotal energy sums of Eq.(1).\n\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATION TO SIMPLE METALS\n\nThe validity of this potential in describing the atomic interactions can be illustrated\noutside the original systems used for parametrisation by considering liquid cobalt.

For all the calculated radial functions,\na third-degree, five-point smoothing procedure is applied several times on the data until\nconvergence [49]. MD simulations are repeated on three different atomic configurations at\nthe same temperature in order to sample more accurately the configurational space and\nan overall averaged RPDF is computed. This averaged RPDF compares very well to the\nexperimental data [50] as shown in Fig. 1. The agreement is similar to that presented by\nBhuiyan et al. [51] and more recently by Han and coworkers [52] using much more elaborate\nEAM potentials, but in these works no quantitative analysis of the RPDFs was performed.\nHowever, the first peak of the RPDF g(r) appears to be asymmetric and might be composed of more than one atomic shell. Following Kita et al. [53], a decomposition of rg(r)\nin consecutive Gaussian functions is applied. The insert in Fig. 1 shows the decomposition\nof rg(r) at 1670 K in six Gaussian functions where all 18 parameters are allowed to vary\nfreely during the fit. The first coordination shell is defined by a cutoff distance rc , which is\ntaken to be the first minimum of g(r). For this temperature, rc = 3.46\u00c5. The first peak is\n\n9\n\n\fcomposed of three Gaussian subpeaks located at r1 = 2.407\u00c5, r2 = 2.645\u00c5 and r3 = 3.095\u00c5,\nrespectively. The coordination number Nc is calculated by integrating the Gaussian function\naccording to Nc = 4\u03c0 3/2 n0 A\u03c3ri , where n0 is the atomic density, A is the amplitude of the\nGaussian function, \u03c3 is the square root of the variance, and ri is the maximum radius. For\neach subpeak, Nc is equal to 3.46, 4.71 and 3.81 with a sum of 11.98. For a temperature of\n1800K, which is slightly greater than the experimental melting point, the sum decreases to\n11.57. These coordination numbers are close to the experimental ones found in liquid Co [50]\n(12.5\u00b10.5 at 1670 K and 12.1\u00b10.5 at 1800 K) and consistent with those calculated for other\nmetallic systems [54]. Such a high value of the coordination number and the possibility of\ndecomposing the first peak of g(r) is an indication that the short-range order of the liquid Co\nis more complex than the one given by a simple icosahedral ordering as suggested by Holland\net al. [50]. Moreover, performing MD simulations for these two temperatures allows us to\npredict a variation of the density with the temperature of d\u03c1/dT = \u22129.68 10\u22124 gcm\u22123 K\u22121 in\n\ngood agreement with the experimentally reported value of d\u03c1/dT = \u22129.88 10\u22124 gcm\u22123 K\u22121\nvalue [48].\n\nMD simulations were repeated under the same conditions for pure Zr to a higher temperature of 2290 K, above the experimental melting point. The experimental RPDF is\ncompared against the simulation of this liquid state, shown in Fig. 2. For this metal at that\ntemperature, the first peak is composed of two Gaussian functions located at r1 = 3.091\u00c5\nand r2 = 3.574\u00c5, respectively. The ratio r2 /r1 = 1.156 is close to that of the two first\n\u221a\nnearest-neighbour distances for a bcc lattice 2/ 3 = 1.1547. The coordination number Nc\nfor each subpeak is 6.10 and 5.59 with a sum of 11.69. This value is close to the experimental\none of 11.9 \u00b1 0.5 found in liquid Zr [55]. Even if the ratio of the radii tends to favour a bcc\nlattice, the corresponding coordination is very different.\nMD simulations are repeated under the same conditions for pure Nb to a higher temperature of 2750 K, which is the experimental melting point. The simulated RPDF of this\nliquid state is shown in Fig. 3. For this metal, the first peak of rg(r) is strongly asymmetric and is composed of three Gaussian functions up to rc = 4.0\u00c5, located at r1 = 2.691\u00c5,\nr2 = 3.141\u00c5 and r3 = 3.840\u00c5. The ratio r2 /r1 = 1.167 is greater than that of the two first\nnearest-neighbour distances for a bcc lattice. The coordination number Nc for each subpeak\nis 2.95, 7.06 and 3.10 with a sum of 13.11. To our knowledge, no experimental data on the\nradial distribution function of pure Nb is available in order to compare with.\n10\n\n\fThe short-range order can also be examined by calculating the bond angle distribution\nfunctions g(\u03b8) that represent the angle between the bonds connecting a central atom to\ntwo neighbouring atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 4 for liquid cobalt, zirconium and niobium.\nThe angle is calculated for pairs of interatomic distances given by a cutoff corresponding to\nthe first minimum of the RPDF (i.e. 3.5\u00c5 for Co, 4.3\u00c5 for Zr and 4.1\u00c5 for Nb). In the\ncase of Zr, the calculated distribution exhibits a prominent peak near \u03b8 = 57\u25e6 (close to an\nequilateral triangle), a broader maximum near \u03b8 = 109\u25e6 and a rather flat maximum near\n\u03b8 = 150\u25e6. In the case of Co, the first peak is broader and close to 55\u25e6 whereas the second\npeak enlarges but remains at 109\u25e6 . For Nb, the situation is different with two broader peaks\nnear 50\u25e6 and 99\u25e6 . Viewing the structure in terms of dominant clusters, the bond angle with\nthe highest density at the nearest neighbour distance are for a regular icosahedron 63.4\u25e6 and\n116.4\u25e6 , while for fcc the prominent angles are 60\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 and 120\u25e6. For hcp, angles of 109.471\u25e6\np\nand 146.443\u25e6 are added when the ratio c/a = 2 2/3 but they are less frequent. For a bcc\n\nlattice, the prominent angles are 70.53\u25e6 and 109.471\u25e6. In the Zr structure, the first peak\ntends to favour the fcc and hcp structures while the second peak tends to favour the hcp\nand bcc. This means that the dominant structure should be hcp. However, the angles of\n90\u25e6 and 120\u25e6 are not so strong whereas some defective icosahedron angles should be there\ntoo. This suggests a predominantly distorted icosahedral character. For the same reasons,\nthe case of Co also favours defective icosahedron as well. For Nb as the first peak is much\nmore located near 50\u25e6 , this suggests much more intriguing short-range structures with less\nneighbours.\nTo assess more quantitatively the local structures in amorphous alloys, Honeycutt and\nAndersen (HA) analysis has been proven to successfully differentiate face-centered cubic,\nhexagonal close packed, icosahedron and binary bcc structures [56, 57]. To perform such\nanalysis, a set of four indices is constructed for each pair: (i) the first index denotes to\nwhat peak of the RPDF, g(r), the pair under consideration belongs; (ii) the second index\nrepresents the number of near neighbours shared by this pair; (iii) the third index counts the\nnumber of nearest-neigbour bonds among the shared neighbours; (iv) and a fourth index is\nused to differentiate configurations with the same three indices, but with a different topology.\nFor instance, fcc crystals are fully described by four pairs, such as 1421, 2101, 2211 and 2441,\nwhereas hcp crystals also contains the 1422 and 2331 pairs in addition. Moreover, the 1441,\n1661, 2101, 2211, and 2441 are the only pairs in a perfect bcc crystal. Icosahedral order is\n11\n\n\fdescribed by Mackay icosahedra, composed of twinned, distorted fcc tetrahedra with an index\nof 1551, whereas the 1541 and 1431 indices are more characteristic of a distorted icosahedral\nlocal order.

The high value of the 2331 pairs is also\nan indication of the icosahedral order. The small distortion from perfect icosahedral order\nobserved in the angular distributions of these liquids suggests that the local icosahedral\norder should dominate. However, small distortion form a perfect tetrahedron does not form\ndifferent HA indices from those for a perfect icosahedron. Our HA analysis shows that the\nicosahedral distortion is larger than reported by the bond angle distribution curves. This\n12\n\n\fresult is in agreement with the experimental investigation on liquid Ti, Zr and Ni conducted\nby Kim and Kelton [58]. Using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, Jakse and\nPasturel [59] have concluded there exists competition between a polyhedral and bcc-type\nshort-range order in liquid and supercooled Zr, whereas Kim and Kelton [58] have reported\nno regular dominant cluster type that can describe the experimental liquid structure of\ntransition metals, including Zr. This is supported by the values of the HA indices reported in\nTable IV which are not very different from each element in the liquid state. The abundance\nof the 1661 pairs indicates that bcc order is very low, but slightly increases when going\nfrom Co to Nb. Interestingly, the lowest energy geometrical structures of magnetic cobalt\nclusters mainly follow an icosahedral growth pattern with some cubic-type structures at\nsome particular sizes [60].\nFor liquid Zr, these low values have been reported both experimentally [58] and using\nfirst-principles molecular dynamics simulations [59]. Furthermore for liquid Zr, Jakse and\nPasturel have performed HA analysis on the inherent structures and found an abundance of\nthe 1551 pairs in the liquid state that is twice the value found here. Such structures indicate\nthe presence of perfect icosahedra as a local minima of the potential energy surface. For\ninstance on liquid Nb, the 1551 index goes to 0.30\u00b10.01 on inherent structure.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPLICATION TO BINARY ALLOYS\n\nTo validate the quality and transferability of our potentials, lattice constants and atomic\ninternal positions of several crystal structures not entering in the fit have been calculated\nminimising the free energy at T=300K, and compared with the experimental values [61, 62].\nThe results are summarised in Table V for the varying degrees of freedom according to the\ncorresponding space group and the agreement is generally good with an average absolute\nerror of 1.76%. To complete the validation, the elastic constants of CoNb and Co3 Nb\nare calculated ab initio applying finite differences to the stress tensor and compared with\nthose calculated analytically by our potentials. The results are shown in Table VI and the\nagreement is satisfying. As for liquids, MD simulations are performed on Co0.9 Zr0.1 for a\n300 atom system with periodic boundary conditions. First, the atoms are placed randomly\ninto the simulation cell using a hard sphere criterion based on their atomic radii and the\ncell volume is then adjusted according to the phenomenological Miedema theory [63], which\n13\n\n\fCo7 Nb6\n\nCo23 Zr6\n\nexp.[61] EAM(300K)\n\nexp.[62] EAM(300K)\n\na(\u00c5) 5.01\n\n5.019(+0.18%) a(\u00c5) 11.516 11.484(-0.28%)\n\nc(\u00c5) 26.5\n\n24.66(-6.95%)\n\nxCo1 0.5\n\n0.5005(+0.10%) xCo4 0.178\n\n0.1732(-2.71%)\n\nyCo1 0.5\n\n0.4995(-0.10%) xZr1 0.208\n\n0.2075(-0.26%)\n\nzCo1 0.59\n\n0.5801(-1.67%)\n\nzN b1 0.167\n\n0.1664(-0.34%)\n\nzN b2 0.346\n\n0.3211(-7.19%)\n\nzN b3 0.448\n\n0.4359(-2.71%)\n\nxCo3 0.378\n\n0.3791(+0.30%)\n\nTABLE V: Lattice constants and atomic internal positions of Co7 Nb6 and Co23 Zr6 calculated with\nour potentials at 300K and compared to the experimental values [61, 62].\n\nCoNb (D2 )\n\nCo3 Nb (L12 )\n\nab initio EAM ab initio EAM\nC11 (GPa)\n\n251\n\n242\n\n368\n\n357\n\nC12 (GPa)\n\n173\n\n143\n\n164\n\n194\n\nC44 (GPa)\n\n60\n\n71\n\n160\n\n131\n\nTABLE VI: ab-initio elastic constants of selected binaries as compared to the present set of potentials.\n\ngives good estimates for the experimental volume of glasses of these alloys. Then at constant\npressure and a temperature of 1800 K (higher than the liquidus phase boundary for this alloy\ncomposition), MD has been run for 200 ps to simulate the liquid phase. The sample is then\nquenched at a rate of 7.5 \u00d7 1014 Ks\u22121 and maintained at 300 K for at least a further 200 ps.\nIn Fig. 5, the simulated RPDFs are computed and compared against experiment [64]. The\nsimulated partial distribution functions for cobalt compare well to experiment including the\nposition of the first and second peaks. However, the experimental Zr-Zr RPDF does not\nexhibit a structural trend, whereas our simulation does. R\u00f6\u00dfler and Teichler have reported\nsimilar results in their study of atomic mobilities and structural properties of supercooled\n14\n\n\famorphous Co1\u2212x Zrx using very different interatomic potentials [4]. This suggests a possible\nlack of resolution both in X-ray diffraction and EXAFS because of a low contribution in the\nspectra of these minority atoms, as previously anticipated [4]. However, our potentials seem\nto reproduced correctly the position of the first peak for Zr-Zr and the double peak character\nof the second peak in the Co-Co and Co-Zr distributions in comparison with ref.[4]. The\nmaximum of the Co-Co peak is simulated to occur at 2.44\u00c5, compared with an experimental\nresult of 2.42\u00c5 [64]. Using the Gaussian subpeak analysis, this first peak is found to be\ncomposed of 3 shells at 2.43\u00c5, 2.55\u00c5 and 2.88\u00c5 with coordination numbers of 4.42, 4.83\nand 2.30. The total coordination number up to rc = 3.12\u00c5 is equal to 11.55 in comparison\nwith 10.90 found experimentally. In our simulations a narrower scattering of the positions of\nthe first 3 subpeaks is observed, in contrast to the liquid state, which is anticipated during\nthe cooling. In the closest crystalline form, Co23 Zr6 , the highest coordination number is\nobtained for a pair of cobalt atoms located at 2.4334\u00c5 in a cubic cluster and other local\nstructures with 4 and 3 neighbours are also found at 2.36\u00c5, 2.51\u00c5, 2.51\u00c5 and 2.81\u00c5 [62]. This\nsuggests tetrahedral clustering below rc or defective icosahedra up to rc in this supercooled\nalloy. On the other hand, the maximum of the first peak in Co-Zr is simulated to be at\n2.79\u00c5, in excellent agreement with the reported experimental distance of 2.79\u00c5 [64]. The\nanalysis through Gaussian functions reveals 2 subpeaks located at 2.71\u00c5 and 3.00\u00c5 with a\ncoordination number of 8.68 and 8.40, respectively. This also suggests a clustering of the\nbcc-type at very short range.\nMD simulations have also been performed for Co0.9 Nb0.1 under the same conditions. The\nreported RPDFs are shown in Fig. 6. In Co0.9 Nb0.1 and Co0.9 Zr0.1 , the Co-Co first peak\ndistance is calculated to be at 2.437\u00c5 and is not affected by the non-magnetic added atoms\nat such a low concentration. The situation changes for the second and third peaks with\na much more distinct third shell in Co0.9 Nb0.1 than in Co0.9 Zr0.1 . Interestingly, the Co-Nb\n(resp.Co-Zr) first neighbour equilibrium distance is 2.49\u00c5 (resp.2.79\u00c5). This is lower than\nthe simple prediction related to their corresponding atomic radii (2.70\u00c5 (resp.2.85\u00c5)) [65].\nHowever, Jamet et al. [66] have reported a Co-Nb distance of 2.58\u00c5 in studying cobalt\nnanoparticles embedded in a niobium matrix. The simulated correlation in the minority\npairs is structured in the Co-Nb system, as for Co-Zr. However, in both cases the first shell\nof neighbours seems to be depleted of their atoms to fill the second or third shells. It is\ndoubtful that these structures are an artefact of the low number of atoms considered in our\n15\n\n\fsimulations because R\u00f6\u00dfler and Teichler have simulated systems more than twice the size\nof ours and found the same behaviour. Up to rc = 3.1\u00c5, the bond angular distributions\nof these two systems are calculated and shown in Fig. 7. These distributions exhibit wellstructured peaks suggesting more crystalline environments including a 150\u25e6 distinct angle\nin the Co0.9 Nb0.1 . As the concentration of minority atoms is low, these distributions are\ndominated by hcp-like Co clusters upon cooling. This trend is more pronounced for added\nNb atoms than Zr atoms probably because of their corresponding atomic radii. To assess\nsuch hypothesis, the HA indices are calculated and reported in Table VII.

The absolute error bars of the abundances are 0.01.\n\ndominant pairs are 1551 and 1541 exhibiting more icosahedral than distorted icosahedral\norder. This tendency is inverted in Co0.9 Nb0.1 system with a larger amount of 1431 pairs\nfavouring distorted icosahedral order. This is explained by a smaller difference in atomic\nradii between Co and Nb than Co and Zr because an atomic size difference of approximately\n10% can relieve spatial frustration and stabilise the icosahedral structure [67]. In Co0.9 Nb0.1\n16\n\n\fthe 1422 pairs are abundant indicating an hcp order which is less present in Co0.9 Zr0.1 system.\nEven if the value is rather low, the 1661 pairs are of importance indicating a slight bcc order,\nas anticipated. It is observed that while useful for gaining understanding of the evolution of\nthe dominant short-range order, the single cluster model cannot capture the richness of the\nsupercooled binary alloys structures.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA fitting procedure has been performed to consistently derive a self-consistent set of manybody parameters for Co, Zr and Nb simple metals and selected alloys, including validation\nagainst first principles results where there are gaps in the experimental data. Combined\nwith MD simulations, these parameters allow us to calculate RPDFs and bond angular\ndistributions in the liquid phase for Co, Zr and Nb. Applied to supercooled binary alloys,\nclear short-range order is shown in agreement with available experiments for the majority\npairs. The situation is different for the minority pairs within the Co-rich region. In this\nregion, both simulated Zr-Zr and Nb-Nb RPDFs are correlated and exhibit transfers of\natoms from the first shells of neighbours to the second and third. The Honeycutt-Andersen\nanalysis exhibits mainly both distorted and pure icosahedral orders of various degrees in\ncompetition with other crystalline orders in the liquid phases and supercooled alloys.\nJDG would like to thank the Government of Western Australia for a Premier's Research\nFellowship.\n\n[1] A.
