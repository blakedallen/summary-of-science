Let X \u2286 PN = P2n\nK be a subvariety of dimension n and P \u2208 P\nN\na generic point. If the tangent variety Tan X is equal to P then for generic\npoints x, y of X the projective tangent spaces tx X and ty X meet in one point\nP = P (x, y). The main result of this paper is that the rational map (x, y) 7\u2192\nP (x, y) is dominant. In other words, a generic point P is uniquely determined\nby the ramification locus R(\u03c0P ) of the linear projection \u03c0P : X \u2192 PN\u22121 .\n\n1. Introduction\nN\n\nLet X \u2286 P =\nbe a subvariety of dimension n and \u039b \u2286 PN a linear subspace\nof codimension k + 1 with k \u2265 n. In [FM2] we studied the question how the\nramification locus R(\u03c0\u039b ) of the linear projection \u03c0\u039b : X \u2192 Pk with center \u039b varies\nwith \u039b. More precisely we considered the problem as to how \u039b is determined by\nR(\u03c0\u039b ).\nThe motivation for this question P\ncomes from the study of the St\u00fcckrad-Vogel\ncycle. If we denote by v = v(X, X) = i vi the St\u00fcckrad-Vogel selfintersection cycle\nof X then by [vGa, FM1] the cycle v2n\u2212k\u22121 may be interpreted as a ramification\n\u2286 PN\ncycle of the generic projection \u03c0\u039bU : X \u2192 Pk , where \u039bU P\nL is the generic linear\nsubspace of codimension k + 1 given by the equations j Uij xj = 0, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\nover the purely transcendental extension field L := K(Uij ).\nIn [FM2] we proved that the cycle v2n\u2212k\u22121 has maximal transcendence degree if\nand only if the rational map \u039b 7\u2192 R(\u03c0\u039b ) from the Grassmannian G(N \u2212 k \u2212 1, N )\nof (N \u2212 k \u2212 1)-planes in PN to the Hilbert scheme Hilb X of X is generically finite.\nIn particular we treated in that paper the case of smooth surfaces in P4 and the\nprojection from a point, i.e. n = 2, N = 4 and \u039b = {P }. Under a suitable positivity condition on the normal bundle NX/P4 (\u22121) we showed that R(\u03c0P ) uniquely\ndetermines P , and from this we deduced that v0 (X, X) has maximal transcendence\ndegree.\nIn a letter to the second author C. Ciliberto improved this by showing that\nfor any nondegenerate smooth surface X in P4 the same result remains true. His\nessential idea was to use the second fundamental form of the surface to conclude\nthat the rational map\n(\u2217)\n\nPN\nK\n\nX \u00d7X\n(x, y)\n\n\u2732 P4\n\u2732 tx X \u2229 ty X\n\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

More precisely we show that if Tan X = P2n\nthen the map (\u2217) is again surjective, where Tan X denotes the tangent variety of X,\ni.e. the closure of the union of all projective tangent spaces tx X at smooth points\nof X. Note that if X is smooth then by a result of Fulton and Lazarsfeld [FL]\nTan X = P2n if and only if Sec X = P2n , where Sec X is the secant variety of X\n(see also [FOV, 1.3 and 4.3.12]). As a corollary we obtain that the St\u00fcckrad-Vogel\ncycle vo (X, X) has maximal transcendence degree under the assumptions above.\nThroughout this paper we work over the field K = C of complex numbers. We\nnote that the results remains valid over any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 by standard arguments. In the following we will use the notations of our\nprevious paper [FM2]. As a general reference on the St\u00fcckrad-Vogel cycle we refer\nthe reader to [FOV].\n2. Transcendence degree of the St\u00fcckrad-Vogel cycle\nLet X be an n-dimensional subvariety of PN with N = 2n. Let x \u2208 X be a\ngeneric point and let U \u223c\n= CN be an affine neighbourhood of x in PN such that x\ncorresponds to 0 \u2208 CN . After a linear change of coordinates we can write X in a\ncomplex neighbourhood V of x=0\n\u02c6 as a graph\nW \u220b u 7\u2192 (u, f (u)) \u2208 V\nwith fu (0) = f (0) = 0, where W is a neighbourhood of 0 in CN .\nWith these notation we will show the following explicit criterion as to when\nTan X has maximal dimension.\nLemma 2.1. The following are equivalent.\n(a) Tan X = PN ;\n(b) fuu (0) * u is a nondegenerate matrix for a generic point u \u2208 Cn .\nProof. Assume (a) is satisfied. Consider the map\nW \u00d7 Cn \u223c\n=T (X \u2229 V )\n(u, \u03be)\n\ncan\n\n\u2732 CN\n\n\u2732 (u + \u03be, f (u) + fu (u) * \u03be),\n\nwhere T (X \u2229 V ) denotes the tangent bundle of X \u2229 V . By (a) the differential of\nthis map has maximal rank, i.e. the matrix\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\nEn\nEn\nEn\nEn\n=\nfuu (0) * \u03be 0\nfu (0) + fuu (0) * \u03be fu (0)\nhas maximal rank, where En is the n-dimensional identity matrix. Hence (b) follows, and by reversing the argument it also follows that (b) implies (a).\n\u0003\nWe can now formulate the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 2.2. Let X be an n-dimensional subvariety of PN with N = 2n. If the\ntangent variety Tan X is equal to PN , then a generic point P \u2208 PN is uniquely\ndetermined by the ramification locus R(\u03c0P ) of the linear projection from P .\nProof. By assumption, Tan X = PN and so in particular Sec X = PN . Thus,\nusing Terracini's lemma [FOV, Proposition 4.3.2], for general points x, y \u2208 X the\n\n\fA NOTE ON GENERIC PROJECTIONS\n\n3\n\nintersection tx X \u2229 ty X consists of just one point P = P (x, y). We need to show\nthat the rational map\n\u2732 PN\nX \u00d7X\n(\u2217)\n(x, y) \u2732 P (x, y)\nis dominant. Let x be a general point of X. Clearly it suffices to prove that the\nrational map\n\u2732 Tx X\nX\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\u2732 P (x, y)\ny\nis dominant. We may assume that x = [1 : 0 : . . . : 0] so that the affine open\nset U = {x0 = 1} \u223c\n= CN is an affine open neighbourhood of x; note that x then\ncorresponds to the origin in CN . After a linear change of coordinates we can write\nX in a (complex) neighbourhood of x =\n\u02c6 0 as a graph\nu 7\u2192 (u, f (u)) \u2208 CN\nwith f (0) = 0, fu (0) = 0. With y = (u, f (u)) the point\nP = P (0, y) = (p(u), 0) \u2208 Tx X,\nis the intersection of the linear subspaces CN \u00d70 and the image of \u03be 7\u2192 (u+\u03be, f (u)+\nfu (u) * \u03be). This leads to u + \u03be = p(u), i.e. \u03be = p(u) \u2212 u and\n0 = f (u) + fu (u) * \u03be = f (u) + fu (u)(p(u) \u2212 u).\nBy 2.1 the matrix fuu (0) * u is nondegenerate. As\nfu (u) = fuu (0) * u + higher order terms\nthe matrix fu (u) is invertible for a general and sufficiently small point u. Thus we\ncan write\np(u) = u \u2212 fu (u)\u22121 f (u).\nWe need to show that u 7\u2192 p(u) has maximal rank. The differential of this map is\n\u03b7\n\n7\u2192 \u03b7 \u2212 fu (u)\u22121 fu (u)\u03b7 + fu (u)\u22121 fuu (u)fu (u)\u22121 \u03b7\n= fu (u)\u22121 fuu (u)fu (u)\u22121 \u03b7.\n\nThus this map has maximal rank, since \u03b7\u0303 = fu (u)\u22121 \u03b7 is a vector in general position,\nso by the lemma fuu (0) * \u03b7\u0303 has maximal rank. As\nfuu (u)\u03b7\u0303 = fuu (0)\u03b7\u0303 + higher order terms\nit follows that also fuu (u)\u03b7\u0303 has maximal rank for u sufficiently small.\n\n\u0003\n\nUsing [FM2, Lemma 3.3] we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 2.3. Let X be an n-dimensional subvariety of PN with N = 2n. If the\ntangent variety Tan X is equal to PN , then the St\u00fcckrad Vogel cycle v0 = v0 (X, X)\nhas maximal transcendence degree.\nIn the case of surfaces in P4 we recover the result of Ciliberto mentioned in the\nintroduction.\nCorollary 2.4. (C.Ciliberto) If X \u2286 P4 is a nondegenerate smooth surface, then\na general point P \u2208 PN is uniquely determined by the ramification locus R(\u03c0P ) of\nthe linear projection from P .\n\n\f4\n\nHUBERT FLENNER AND MIRELLA MANARESI\n\nProof. If Tan X 6= P4 then dim Tan X = dim Sec X = dim X + 1 and so by [FOV,\n4.6.6(1)] Sec X is a linear subspace of dimension 3, which contradicts the fact that\nX is nondegenerate. Thus 2.2 implies the result.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5. We note that Ciliberto's argument is different from our proof. He uses\nthe fact that for a nondegenerate surface which is not a cone the second fundamental\nform is nondegenerate.\nRemark 2.6. The example 4.8 given in [FM2] is not a counterexample to the maximality of the transcendence degree of the St\u00fcckrad-Vogel cycle as was claimed\nthere. The mistake comes from the fact that the dimension of the family of lines\nP1 \u0592\u2192 P1 \u00d7 Pm of bidegree (1,1) was not calculated correctly. It is 2m + 1 (and not\n2m \u2212 2), since such a map is given by (\u03b1, j), where \u03b1 is an automorphism of P1 and\nj : P1 \u0592\u2192 Pm is the embedding of a line.\nReferences\n[Ci]\nCiliberto, C.: Letter dated from April 2001\n[FM1] Flenner, H.; Manaresi, M.: Intersections of projective varieties and generic projections.\nManuscripta Math. 92, 273-286 (1997)\n[FM2] Flenner, H.; Manaresi, M.: Variation of ramification loci of generic projections.
