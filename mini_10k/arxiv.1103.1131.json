In this paper we prove a general, abstract\ntheorem which applies to most of the situations analyzed in the mentioned\npapers.\nIn section 2 we give an abstract definition of soliton. Section 3 is devoted to\nthe main result, namely an existence result for hylomorphic solitons (Theorem\n11). These solitons are minimizers, satisfying suitable stability properties, of a\nconstrained functional. The proof of Theorem 11 is carried out in two steps: in\nthe first step the research of the minimizers of a constrained functional is reduced\nto the study of the minimizers of a suitable free functional (Theorem 15). In\nthe second step stability properties of these minimizers are proved (subsection\n3.2).\nIn section 4 we give an idea (the complete proofs being contained in the\nquoted papers) of how the abstract theorem 11 can be used to prove the existence\nof solitons in some dynamical systems, namely for the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, the nonlinear wave equation, the nonlinear beam equation and the\nKlein-Gordon-Maxwell equation. In a forthcoming paper we shall use theorem\n11 to study new situations.\n\n2\n\nAn abstract definition of solitons\n\nSolitons are particular states of a dynamical system described by one or more\npartial differential equations. Thus, we assume that the states of this system\nare described by one or more fields which mathematically are represented by\nfunctions\nu : RN \u2192 V\n(1)\nwhere V is a vector space with norm | * |V which is called the internal parameters\nspace. We assume the system to be deterministic; this means that it can be\ndescribed as a dynamical system (X, \u03b3) where X is the set of the states and\n\u03b3 : R \u00d7 X \u2192 X is the time evolution map. If u0 (x) \u2208 X, the evolution of the\nsystem will be described by the function\nu (t, x) := \u03b3t u0 (x).\n\n(2)\n\nWe assume that the states of X have \"finite energy\" so that they decay at \u221e\nsufficiently fast. Roughly speaking, the solitons are \"bump\" solutions characterized by some form of stability.\n2\n\n\fTo define them at this level of abstractness, we need to recall some well\nknown notions in the theory of dynamical systems.\nDefinition 1 A set \u0393 \u2282 X is called invariant if \u2200u \u2208 \u0393, \u2200t \u2208 R, \u03b3t u \u2208 \u0393.\nDefinition 2 Let (X, d) be a metric space and let (X, \u03b3) be a dynamical system.\nAn invariant set \u0393 \u2282 X is called stable, if \u2200\u03b5 > 0, \u2203\u03b4 > 0, \u2200u \u2208 X,\nd(u, \u0393) \u2264 \u03b4,\nimplies that\n\u2200t \u2265 0, d(\u03b3t u,\u0393) \u2264 \u03b5.\nFor every z \u2208 ZN , and u \u2208 X, we set\n(gz u) (x) = u (x \u2212 Az) .\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A is an inverible matrix; such a gz will be called lattice transformation.\nWe set\nG = {gz | z \u2208 G} ;\n(4)\n\u0001\nN\nwhere G is a subgroup of Z , + . G is a group of transformations acting on\nthe space X; actually it is a linear representation of the group G.\nDefinition 3 A non-empty subset \u0393 \u2282 X is called G-invariant if\n\u2200u \u2208 \u0393, \u2200z \u2208 ZN , gz u \u2208 \u0393.\nDefinition 4 A closed G-invariant set \u0393 \u2282 X is called G-compact if for any\nsequence un (x) in \u0393 there is a sequence gn \u2208 G, such that un (gn x) has a converging subsequence.\nNow we are ready to give the definition of soliton:\nDefinition 5 A state u(x) \u2208 X is called soliton if there is an invariant set \u0393\nsuch that\n\u2022 (i) \u2200t, \u03b3t u(x) \u2208 \u0393,\n\u2022 (ii) \u0393 is stable,\n\u2022 (iii) \u0393 is G-compact.\nRemark 6 The above definition needs some explanation. For simplicity, we\nassume that \u0393 is a manifold (actually, in many concrete models, this is the\ngeneric case). Then (iii) implies that \u0393 is finite dimensional. Since \u0393 is invariant, u0 \u2208 \u0393 \u21d2 \u03b3t u0 \u2208 \u0393 for every time. Thus, since \u0393 is finite dimensional,\nthe evolution of u0 is described by a finite number of parameters. The dynamical system (\u0393, \u03b3) behaves as a point in a finite dimensional phase space. By\nthe stability of \u0393, a small perturbation of u0 remains close to \u0393. However, in\nthis case, its evolution depends on an infinite number of parameters. Thus, this\nsystem appears as a finite dimensional system with a small perturbation.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nExistence of hylomorphic solitons\n\nWe now assume that the dynamical system (X, \u03b3) has l + 1 integrals of motion.\nOne of them will be called energy and it will be denoted by E; the set of the\nother integrals can be considered as a functional\nC : X \u2192 Rl\nand it will be called hylenic charge. At this level of abstractness, the name\nenergy and hylenic charge are conventional, but E and C need to satisfy different\nassumptions see assumption (EC-3) below. In our applications to PDE, E will\nbe the usual energy. The name hylenic charge has been introduced in [4], [1],\n[2] and here this name will denote just a set of other integrals.\nThe presence of E and C allows to give the following definition of hylomorphic soliton.\nDefinition 7 A soliton u0 \u2208 X is hylomorphic if \u0393 (as in Def. 5) has the\nfollowing structure\n\u0393 = \u0393 (e0 , c0 ) = {u \u2208 X | E(u) = e0 , C(u) = c0 }\nwhere\ne0 = min {E(u) | C(u) = c0 }\n\n(5)\n\nl\n\nfor some c0 \u2208 R .\nNotice that, by (5), we have that a hylomorphic soliton u0 satisfies the\nfollowing nonlinear eigenvalue problem:\nE \u2032 (u0 ) =\n\nl\nX\n\n\u03bbj Cj\u2032 (u0 )\n\nj=1\n\nwhere we have set C(u) = (C1 (u), ..., Cl (u))\nClearly, for a given c0 , the minimum of E might not exist; moreover, even if\nthe minimum exists, it is possible that \u0393 does not satisfy (ii) or (iii) of def. 5.\nIn order to prove an existence result for hylomorphic solitons, we impose\nsome assumptions to E and C; to do this we need some other definitions:\nDefinition 8 We say that a functional F on X has the splitting property if\ngiven a sequence un = u + wn \u2208 X such that wn converges weakly to 0, we have\nthat\nF (un ) = F (u) + F (wn ) + o(1)\n(6)\n\n4\n\n\fRemark 9 Every quadratic form satisfies the splitting property; in fact, in this\ncase, we have that F (u) := hLu, ui for some continuous selfajoint operator L;\nthen, given a sequence un = u + wn with wn \u21c0 0 weakly, we have that\nF (un ) = hLu, ui + hLwn , wn i + 2 hLu, wn i\n= F (u) + F (wn ) + o(1)\nNow we can formulate the properties we require:\n\u2022 (EC-1) there are l + 1 prime integrals E(u) and C(u) = (C1 (u), ..., Cl (u))\nof the dynamical system (X, \u03b3) such that\nE(0) = 0, C(0) = 0; E \u2032 (0) = 0; C \u2032 (0) = 0\n\u2022 (EC-2) E(u) and C(u) are G-invariant.\n\u2022 (EC-3)(coercivity assumption) suppose that there exists a \u2265 0, and s \u2265 1\nsuch that\ns\n\n\u2013 (i) E(u) + a |C(u)| \u2265 0;\ns\n\n\u2013 (ii) if kuk \u2192 \u221e, then E(u) + a |C(u)| \u2192 \u221e\ns\n\n\u2013 (iii) for any sequence un in X such that E(un ) + a |C(un )| \u2192 0, we\nhave that un \u2192 0\n\u2022 (EC-4) E and |C| satisfy the splitting property.\n\nDefinition 10 A norm (or a seminorm) k*k\u266f is called a auxiliary norm (or\nseminorm) on X if it satisfies the following property:\n\u2022 given any sequence kun k bounded in X such that kun k\u266f \u2265 \u03b4 > 0, we can\nextract a subsequence unk and we can take a sequence gk \u2208 G such that\ngk unk is weakly convergent to some \u016b 6= 0.\nThe notion of auxiliary norm is related to a result obtained by Lieb in [12].\nIn our abstract scheme, this norm allows to define the following number:\nE(u)\n.\nkuk\u266f \u21920 |C(u)|\n\n\u039b0 := lim inf\nNow we can state the main result:\n\n5\n\n(7)\n\n\fTheorem 11 Assume that the dynamical system (X, \u03b3) satisfies (EC-1),...,(EC4). Moreover assume that\nE(u)\ninf\n< \u039b0 .\n(8)\nu\u2208X |C(u)|\n\u0001\nThen, the dynamical system (X, \u03b3) admits a continuous family u\u03b4 (\u03b4 \u2208 0, \u03b4\u0304 ,\n\u03b4\u0304 > 0) of independent, hylomorphic solitons (two solitons u\u03b41 , u\u03b42 are called\nindependent if u\u03b41 6= gu\u03b42 for every g \u2208 G).\nWe will prove Theorem 11 in two steps:\n\u2022 first step: existence of a set of minimizers \u0393 as in def. 7\n\u2022 second step: proof of the stability of \u0393\n\n3.1\n\nAn existence result for constrained minimizers\n\nIn this section, we will be concerned with the first step. We need some definitions. These definitions are related to a couple (X, G) where G is a group acting\non X. In our applications G will be the group (3), but these results hold also in\nan abstract framework.\nDefinition 12 Let G be a group acting on X. A sequence un in X is called\nG-compact if we can extract a subsequence unk such that there exists a sequence\ngk \u2208 G such that gk unk is convergent.\nDefinition 13 A functional J on X is called G-invariant if\n\u2200g \u2208 G, \u2200u \u2208 X, J (gu) = J (u) .\nDefinition 14 A functional J on X is called G-compact if any minimizing\nsequence un is G-compact.\nNotice that a G-compact functional has a G-compact set of minimizers (see\ndef. 4).\nNow, we will prove the following existence result:\nTheorem 15 Assume that E and C satisfy (EC-1),...,(EC-4) and\n\u0001 (8).

Then, since\n\u016b+wn is a minimizing sequence for J\u03b4 , also E(\u016b + wn ) and \u03a6(\u016b + wn ) converge\nto 0.

Thus J\u03b4 is G-compact\nand the set of minimizer \u0393\u03b4 is not empty.

For completeness, we give a proof of this well known result. Arguing\nby contradiction, assume that \u0393, satisfying the assumptions of Th. 16, is not\nstable. Then there exists \u03b5 > 0 and sequences un \u2208 X and tn > 0 such that\nd(un , \u0393) \u2192 0 and d(\u03b3tn (un ) , \u0393) > \u03b5.\n\n(25)\n\nThen we have\nd(un , \u0393) \u2192 0 =\u21d2 V (un ) \u2192 0 =\u21d2 V (\u03b3tn (un )) \u2192 0 =\u21d2 d(\u03b3tn (un ) , \u0393) \u2192 0\nwhere the first and the third implications are consequence of property (c). The\nsecond implication follows from property (b). Clearly, this fact contradicts (25).\n\u0003\nThe following Theorem holds:\nTheorem 17 Assume (EC-1) and (EC-2). For u \u2208 X and e0 , c0 \u2208 R, we set\n2\n\n2\n\nV (u) = (E (u) \u2212 e0 ) + (C (u) \u2212 c0 ) .\n\n(26)\n\nIf V is G-compact and\n\u0393 = {u \u2208 X : E(u) = e0 , C(u) = c0 } 6= \u2205,\nthen every u \u2208 \u0393 is a soliton.\n10\n\n(27)\n\n\fProof : We have to prove that \u0393 in (27) satisfies (i),(ii) and (iii) of Def. (5).\nThe property (iii), namely the fact that \u0393 is G-compact, is a trivial consequence\nof the fact that \u0393 is the set of minimizers of a G-compact functional V. The\ninvariance property (i) is clearly satisfied since E and C are constants of the\nmotion. It remains to prove (ii), namely that \u0393 is stable. To this end we shall\nuse Th. 16. So we need to show that V (u) satisfies (a), (b) and (c). Statements\n(a) and (b) are trivial. Now we prove (c). First we show the implication \u21d2 .\nLet un be a sequence such that V (un ) \u2192 0. By contradiction we assume that\n\u2032\nd(un , \u0393) 9 0, namely that there is a subsequence un such that\nd(u\u2032n , \u0393) \u2265 a > 0.\n\n(28)\n\nSince V (un ) \u2192 0 also V (u\u2032n ) \u2192 0, and, since V is G compact, there exists a\nsequence gn in G such that, for a subsequence u\u2032\u2032n , we have gn u\u2032\u2032n \u2192 u0 . Then\nd(u\u2032\u2032n , \u0393) = d(gn u\u2032\u2032n , \u0393) \u2264 d(gn u\u2032\u2032n , u0 ) \u2192 0\nand this contradicts (28).\nNow we prove the other implication \u21d0 . Let un be a sequence such that\nd(un , \u0393) \u2192 0, then there exists vn \u2208 \u0393 s.t.\nd(un , \u0393) \u2265 d(un , vn ) \u2212\n\n1\n.\nn\n\n(29)\n\nSince V is G-compact, also \u0393 is G-compact; so, for a suitable sequence gn ,\nwe have gn vn \u2192 w\u0304 \u2208 \u0393. We get the conclusion if we show that V (un ) \u2192 0. We\nhave by (29), that d(un , vn ) \u2192 0 and hence d(gn un , gn vn ) \u2192 0 and so, since\ngn vn \u2192 w\u0304, we have gn un \u2192 w\u0304 \u2208 \u0393. Therefore, by the continuity of V and since\nw\u0304 \u2208 \u0393, we have V (gn un ) \u2192 V (w\u0304) = 0 and we can conclude that V (un ) \u2192 0.\n\u0003\nIn the cases in which we are interested, X is an infinite dimensional manifold;\nthen if you choose generic e0 and c0 , V is not G-compact since the set \u0393 =\n{u \u2208 X : E(u) = e0 , C(u) = c0 } has codimension 2. However, Th. (15) allows\nto determine e0 and c0 in such a way that V is G-compact and hence to prove\nthe existence of solitons by using Theorem 17.\nProof of Th. 11. In order to prove Th. 11, we will use Th. 17 with e0 = e\u03b4\nand c0 = c\u03b4 where e\u03b4 and c\u03b4 are given by Th. 15.\nWe set\n2\n2\nV (u) = (E (u) \u2212 e\u03b4 ) + (C (u) \u2212 c\u03b4 ) .\n(30)\nWe show that V is G-compact: let wn be a minimizing sequence for V, then\nV (wn ) \u2192 0 and consequently E (wn ) \u2192 e\u03b4 and C (wn ) \u2192 c\u03b4 . Now, since\nmin J\u03b4 =\n\ne\u03b4\n+ \u03b4 [e\u03b4 + acs\u03b4 ] ,\nc\u03b4\n\nwe have that wn is a minimizing sequence also for J\u03b4 . Then, since J\u03b4 is Gcompact, we get\nwn is G-compact.\n(31)\n11\n\n\fSo we conclude that V is G-compact and hence the conclusion follows by using\nTheorem 17.\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nSome applications\n\nIn this section we show how the abstract theorem 11 can be used to prove existence of solitons in some dynamical systems, namely for the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, the nonlinear wave equation, the nonlinear beam equation and the\nKlein-Gordon-Maxwell equation.
