Spectroscopic techniques are powerful tools to\nobtain information about these properties, since they\nprovide direct information on the electronic and magnetic elementary excitations, which are related to the energy spectra, the crystal structure, and so on. Among\nthe spectroscopic techniques used to probe magnetic excitations in cuprates, Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) has gained much interest because of the recent increases in energy and momentum resolution, due\nto the enhanced brilliance of synchrotron x-ray sources\nand the advances in instrumentations. This has placed\nRIXS at the forefront in the study of the momentum dependent electronic and magnetic responses over a wide\nenergy range.1\u201315\nIn the RIXS process, x-ray radiation is inelastically\nscattered by the matter and the change in energy, momentum and polarization can be related to intrinsic excitations in the material. This process is resonant because\nthe energy of an incoming photon is tuned to match an\nelement absorption edge, thus allowing a large enhancement of the scattered intensity. In this way the x-ray\nphotons can couple to charge, spin and orbital degrees of\nfreedom.16\u201330\nIn the context of the cuprates, it is by now wellestablished that RIXS can detect the momentum dependence of charge excitations that are related to the electrons and holes in the d shell,2,24,25 , but it has also been\nproved, both experimentally and theoretically, that RIXS\nis sensitive to the magnetic excitations of cuprates.\nTypeset by REVTEX\n\nA.\n\nMagnetic RIXS in cuprates\n\nIn the magnetic sector, RIXS can both create single\nand double spin flip excitations, corresponding to singleand bi-magnon excitations in ordered Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFM). Moreover, it has been also predicted\nthat three-magnon scatterings contribute substantially to\nthe magnetic spectral weight,31 whereas single-magnon\nexcitations were observed in direct RIXS experiments at\nthe Cu L3 edge on a thin film of La2 CuO4 ,19\u201321,28 and\nalso on small crystals of Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 .23\nFrom a theoretical point of view, when the magnetic\nmoment lies in the plane of the x2 \u2212 y 2 orbital, direct\nspin-flip scattering in cuprates is allowed for symmetry\nreasons. Thus, at least for this class of materials, L-edge\nRIXS can be placed on the same footing as neutron scattering, and both are related to the two-spin dynamical\ncorrelation function.19\nAt the Cu K-edge, the RIXS process is indirect and\nsingle-magnon scattering is forbidden. In this case,\nmagnetic excitations turn out to be due to bi-magnon,\nas observed in insulating and doped La2\u2212x Srx CuO4\nand Nd2 CuO4 .16,22 Subsequently, excitations with a bimagnon-like dispersion have been observed in cuprates\nwith high-resolution L-edge RIXS,17,18 and M-edge\nRIXS.32 This makes RIXS thus complementary to optical\nRaman scattering, which also measures the bi-magnon,\nbut only at zero momentum transfer.33\u201337 .\nThe microscopic mechanism by which the bi-magnons\ncouple to the intermediate state core-hole in Cu Kedge RIXS is by the core-hole locally modifying the superexchange constant. This leads to the measurement\nof a four-spin correlation function that can be derived\nin detail via the Ultrashort Core-hole Lifetime (UCL)\nexpansion.26,27,38,39 This approach yields a momentum\ndependence of the cross section in agreement with ex-\n\n\f2\nperiments on undoped cuprates in the N\u00e8el state. In\nparticular it reproduces the lack of intensity at q=(0,0)\nand (\u03c0, \u03c0).16,22 At the Cu L- and M-edges, the coupling\nmechanism to bi-magnon excitations is similar, resulting\nin the same cross section to lowest order in the perturbing effective potential between the spin and the core-hole,\ndue to the fact that the superexchange in the intermediate state is, in this case, not just altered but completely\nblocked locally.17\nDespite the success in describing undoped cuprates,\nthe doping dependence of both single- and multi-magnon\nmeasured by RIXS is rather little unexplored, however\nwith the first data available showing intriguing behavior. For K-edge measurements on La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 , the\nintensity of the spectral features is found to generally decrease as x increases.16,22 The persistence of the highest\npeak at (\u03c0, 0), located around 500 meV, for doping values x = 0.07, well into the superconducting phase, shows\nthat this excitation survives even if long-range magnetic\norder is absent, as long as significant short-range magnetic correlations are present, which is well-known to be\nthe case in the superconducting state of LSCO.40,41 The\nevolution upon doping observed in L-edge RIXS measurements on LSCO is even more captivating, showing\nthe existence of a high energy \"undoped\" branch in addition to the lower-energy dispersive features measured in\nneutron scattering, which can be related to the presence\nof a stripe liquid21 .\n\nB.\n\nAim and Outline\n\nIn this paper we analyze the doping dependence of\nmagnetic RIXS in cuprates, and particularly we explore\nthe evolution of the magnetic excitations with doping.\nWe focus on 1D systems because i) strong quantum fluctuations are present, that maximally effect the magnetic\nordering, ii) the existence of an exact theoretical results\nfor magnetic excitations in the undoped 1D Heisenberg\nAFM, formulated in the spinon language, provides a\nstringent reference test for our numerical spectra, iii) the\nsampling of the Brillouin Zone (BZ) is much more dense\nthan in the 2D case, and iv) the results are directly relevant for RIXS on 1D cuprates, such as Sr2 CuO3 , where\nexperiments probing the low-energy magnetic excitations\nare entirely feasible.42 These 1D spin liquid states may be\nrelevant to the proposed stripe liquid behavior in hightemperature superconductors.\nWe present numerical calculations of different-time\nTwo-Spin (TS) and Four-Spin (FS) correlation functions,\nevaluated on 22 sites chain for the Heisenberg model and\n16 sites chain for the t \u2212 J model, in the low doping\nregime with a doping concentration up to 1/8. Even if\nthe analysis is limited by the finite length of the system,\none can extract relevant information about the intensity\nand the dispersion of the magnetic features by quantitative analysis of total spectral weight (W0 ), and its first\nmoment (W1 ), corresponding to the average energy peak\n\nposition. Besides, the higher energy features are expected\nto be less affected by finite size effects.\nWe firstly consider the undoped case assuming a description based on the nearest-neighbour AFM Heisenberg model on a chain. It turns out that both TS and FS\ncorrelation functions detect two-spinon excitations, with\na spectral weight that is concentrated at the lower boundary of the continuum of excitations. We point out that\nTS and FS access excitations belonging to orthogonal\nsubspaces, having total spin S=1 and S=0, respectively.\nMoreover, we recover crucial differences about momentum dispersion and selection rules: TS is peaked at \u03c0\nwhere FS vanishes, whereas the latter is peaked at \u03c0/2.\nThis result highlights the different length-scale between\nthe TS and the FS excitation. The latter has a characteristic length-scale of 2a, where a is the lattice spacing,\nas two (neighboring) exchange bonds are broken in the\nintermediate state. This shifts the maximum from \u03c0 towards \u00b1\u03c0/2. These results are consistent with recent\nBethe Ansatz calculations43 . We subsequently study the\nspectral evolution upon doping, by using the same approach on a t \u2212 J chain containing mobile holes. The\nmagnetic response is found to soften and broaden as a\nfunction of the doping concentration. Nevertheless, both\nthe momentum dispersion and the total spectral weight\nare only slightly affected by a doping of 1/16 and 1/8.\nOnly the two-spin response at \u03c0 changes strongly, with\na large reduction of its spectral weight and an enhancement of the excitation energy. At other momenta the\nhigher-energy, generic features of the magnetic response\nare robust against doping. This shows that the strong\nshort-range antiferromagnetic correlations that are still\npresent after doping give rise to higher energy, damped\nmagnetic excitations with considerable spectral weight.\n\nII.\n\nMAGNETIC EXCITATIONS IN THE 1D t \u2212 J\nMODEL\n\nThe t\u2212J Hamiltonian is one of the most studied model\nHamiltonians in the context of high temperature superconductivity in doped, quasi-2D cuprates. Naturally, it\nis directly relevant to quasi-1D cuprates as well, among\nwhich edge-sharing 1D spin chains in Li2 CuO2 and\nGeCuO3 and corner sharing in SrCuO2 and Sr2 CuO3 .\nCharge excitations have been extensively studied by exact diagonalization of Hubbard or charge-transfer models relevant for these systems, also in the context of\nRIXS44,45 . In a Hubbard-type model for an undoped\nchain the presence of singlet excitations of spinon pairs\nwas identified, which is due to the presence of doubly\noccupied sites46 . Very recently the RIXS response of\nthe undoped spin-only chain was computed by Bethe\nAnsatz, which will serve as a benchmark for the present\nexact diagonalization study.43 . However, the magnetic\nresponse of doped t \u2212 J chains has received remarkably\nlittle attention in the literature so far. Studies of spin dynamics in the 1D t \u2212 J model have considered the limit\n\n\f3\n\nA.\n\nTwo-spinon Continuum\n\n\u03a9\u0090J\n\nof quarter-filling, with a hole concentration of 3/4, by\nMonte-Carlo47,48 , exact-diagonalization49 and recursion\nmethods50 , focusing on the regime of weak and strong\ncoupling, comparing one- and two-dimensional features,\nas well as determining the evolution of the spinon spectrum in presence of magnetic anisotropy. Here we consider the weakly doped chain, with doping concentrations\nwhere in the 2D cuprates superconductivity appears and\nwe concentrate on the specific question how far the different types of magnetic excitations to which RIXS is\nsensitive are affected by the presence of mobile charge\ncarriers.\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n0\n\n3\u03a0\n2\n\n\u03a0\nq\n\nFour-spinon Continuum\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2\u03a0 0\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n\u03a0\n\n3\u03a0\n2\n\n2\u03a0\n\nq\n\nFIG. 1. Two-spinon (left panel) and four-spinon (right panel)\ncontinua, stemmed in the colored regions. Color scale is not\nrelated to the spectral weight.\n\nZero doping Heisenberg limit\n\nWithout doping the 1D t \u2212 J model reduces to the\nHeisenberg AFM, which is one of the few many-body\nproblems where the ground state, which is a SU(2) singlet, and the lowest excited states are known exactly.51\nIt is described by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian\nHHeis = J\n\nX\n\nSi * Sj ,\n\n(1)\n\nhi,ji\n\nwhere J is the exchange coupling and Si is the spin operator at the i-site. It is well-known that this model fails\nto develop long-range N\u00e8el ordering (where neighbouring spins point anti-parallel to each other) even at the\nlowest temperatures but rather it has an algebraically\ndecaying spin-spin correlation.52,53 Moreover, the basic\nexcitations are spinons,54\u201356 which are topological excitations that can be visualized as twists of \u03c0 in the spin\norder. Spinons are fractional particles that possess spin\nvalues of S = 1/2, whose dispersion relation is given by\ne(p) = \u03c0/2| sin p|, p \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, 0] in unit of J. Because of\nquantum mechanics constraints, only an even number of\nspinons can be created.\nThe lowest energy excitations are made of two spinon\nstates, that live within a continuum in (k, \u03c9) defined by\nthe kinematic constraints of momentum and energy conservation: k = \u2212p1 \u2212 p2 and \u03c9 = e(p1 ) + e(p2 ). Hence,\nfor a fixed external momentum, there exists an interval\nin frequency given by the conditions:\n\u03c9 \u2265 \u03c92,L (k) = \u03c0/2| sin k|; \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c92,U (k) = \u03c0| sin k/2| ,\n(2)\nwith k \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. Here, \u03c92,L (k) and \u03c92,U (k) correspond to\nthe lower and upper bands, respectively. This behavior\nobviously very different from 2D and 3D systems, where\nthe excitations in the ordered state are spin-waves, which\npossess a spin value equal to one and follow a well-defined\ntrajectory in energy and wave-vector space in complete\ncontrast to the multi-spinon continuum.\nTwo-spinon excitations are routinely measured by inelastic neutron scattering57\u201360 , but the same response\nfunction can also be measured with RIXS. A wealth of\ntheoretical work has been done on the TS correlation\n\nfunction related to neutron structure factor and the exact theoretical spectrum perfectly matches with experimental results.61\u201363\nThe two-spinon part of the TS function is finite inside\nthe two-spinon continuum, and by construction it vanishes identically outside of it. It has been demonstrated\nthat approximately two thirds of the excitations in this\nband are indeed of the two-spinon type. The remaining part has a rather small spectral weight and is carried mostly by four-spinon excitations.64 In Fig.1, these\ntwo-spinon and four-spinon bands are schematically represented. Recently it was proven for the FS response\nfunction, even if it involves the excitation of two spins,\noverwhelmingly fractionalizes into two-spinon states.43\nWithin this context, we now start a systematic comparison of the numerical spectra related to the TS and\nFS correlation functions. We will demonstrate that our\nresults recover the main features (e.g., dispersion and selection rules) of the exact theoretical results, providing\nthe starting point for the subsequent discussion about\ndoping evolution.\n\nB.\n\nCross section for magnetic RIXS\n\nIn the Introduction we mentioned that both direct\nand indirect RIXS can probe magnetic excitations. In\ndirect RIXS, single spin-flip excitations can be made at\nthe 2p \u2192 3d edges of Cu because of the large spin-orbit\ncoupling of the 2p core-hole.19 Since in the intermediate\nstate spin and orbital angular momentum separately\nare no longer good quantum numbers, orbital and spin\ncan be exchanged and direct spin-flip processes can\nin principle be allowed. As in the neutron scattering,\nthe RIXS cross section consists of a local structure\nfactor (depending on the polarization, the experimental\ngeometry and the excitation mechanism) multiplied by\nthe appropriate spin susceptibility19\nS(q, w) \u221d\n\nX\nf\n\n|h0|S(q)|f i2 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9f i ) ,\n\n(3)\n\n\f4\nS(q, w ) Two-spin response\n\nTwo Spin Response\nnh=0\n\nnh=0\n\ninitial state\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\n\nsingle spin flip\n\nO(q, w ) Four-spin response\n\n0\n\n0\nnh=1\u009016\n\nnh=1\u009016\n\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\n\nSHq,\u03a9L\n\npropagating spinons\nwith parallel spin\n\n0\n\n0\n\ninitial state\n\nnh=1\u00908\n\nnh=1\u00908\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\n\ndouble spin flip\npropagating spinons\nwith opposite spin\n\nwhere |0i is the ground state, |f i an excited\nP state, \u03c9f i\nthe energy lost by the photon, and S(q) = i expiqRi Szi\nis the single-spin form factor. It was shown both\ntheoretically,19,28 and experimentally21 that spin-flip excitations are a result of the effect of Lz Sz operator in the\ncore hole spin-orbit coupling, so one can get a pure spinflip transition for a Cu2+ ion with a hole in the 3dx2 \u2212y2\norbital only if the spin is not parallel to the z-axis.\nFor indirect RIXS at Cu K-edges (1s \u2192 4p), the core\nhole couples to the spin degree of freedom locally modifying the superexchange interactions.26,27 In this process, the total spin of the valence electrons is conserved,\nand only excitations with at least two spins flipped\n(with total Sz = 0) are allowed.16,22 Detailed calculations of the magnetic response functions within the UCL\nexpansion38,39 demonstrated that the magnetic correlation function, measured by indirect RIXS, is a four-spin\ncorrelation one,\nX\nO(q, w) \u221d\n|h0|O(q)|f i2 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9f i ) ,\n(4)\nf\n\nP\n\nP\nwhere O(q) = i expiqRi ( \u03b4 Si * Si+\u03b4 ) is the two-spin\nform factor. At the transition metal L-edges, a similar\nmechanism occurs (in addition to the direct single spinflip scattering discussed above) because the photo-excited\nelectron in the 3d subshell frustrates the local superexchange bonds.17\nTo calculate S(q, \u03c9) and O(q, \u03c9), we apply the Lanczos\nalgorithm to a 22-sites Heisenberg chain and we employ\neigenvectors and eigenvalues for the evaluation of the correlation functions as in Eqs. 3-4.

Note\nthat these outcomes are possibly easier to compare with\nexperiments, with respect to the differential cross-section\nitself. The reason is twofold: i) the presence of statistical\nerrors in experiments is less relevant for the integrated\nquantities, so a direct comparison with theory is feasible;\nii) since lineshapes of the theoretical spectra are typically\nnot Lorentzian, the average excitation energy of the calculated spectra is expected to be the most representative\ntheoretical result.\nBefore describing the results obtained within our simulation, we would like to point out that the magnetic\nexcitations described by Eqs. 3-4 belong to orthogonal\nsubspaces, as illustrated in Fig.2. The figure aims to\nclarify that the S(q, \u03c9) TS response is related to a single\nspin-flip that gives rise to a two spinons carrying parallel\nspin. Instead O(q, \u03c9) FS response function is due to a\ndouble spin-flip that fractionalize into two spinons, having opposite spin. Starting from the SU(2) singlet ground\nstate, the excitation governing S(q, \u03c9) thus carries S=1\nwhile for O(q, \u03c9) the excitation has S=0. This crucial\naspect allows to distinguish between 'polarized' and 'unpolarized' excitations and suggests that the two magnetic\nresponses can have a different sensitivity to for example\nspinon-spinon interactions or an external magnetic field.\nIn the top panels of Figs. 3-4, we report the undoped\ninelastic intensity evaluated numerically starting from\nTS and FS correlation functions, respectively. There\nare several common features emerging: the dispersions\nshow similar behavior, the excitation spectrum is mainly\nlocated in the two-spinon band, both for S(q, \u03c9) and\nO(q, \u03c9), with an energy scale \u03c92,L < \u03c9 < \u03c92,U . Moreover, the intensity is dominated by the spectral weight at\nthe lower threshold of the two-spinon continuum. These\nresults confirm that both S(q, \u03c9) and O(q, \u03c9) mainly fractionalize in two-spinon excitations43 . From a closer inspection at the energy region comprised between the upper boundary of the two-spinon continuum and the upper boundary of the four-spinon continuum, high energy\ntails emerge as consequence of the four-spinon part of\nthe structure factors, that are finite but very small and\nrapidly approaching to zero.\nNevertheless, spectra do show differences in dispersion.\nLooking at the white circles of Fig. 5, we infer that for\nthe correlation function O(q, \u03c9) the spectrum disperses\nfrom zero at q = 0, up to a maximum of \u223c 2J at \u03c0/2, the\nintensity is suppressed at \u03c0 and nearby, a fact that is due\nto structure factor eiqRi and not to the density of states,\nas reported in lower panel of Fig. 5 where the moment W1\nis plotted. The vanishing of the RIXS intensity described\nby O(q, \u03c9) at the antiferromgnetic wavevector \u03c0 is due to\nthe cancellation of the sums over the two sublattices in\n\n\u03a0\n4\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n3\u03a0\n4\n\n\u03a0\n4\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n3\u03a0\n4\n\n\u03a0\n\nq\n\nq\n\nFIG. 5. Total weight (upper panel) and first moment (lower\npanel) of the TS (left side) and FS (right side) correlation\nfunction on a 16-sites chain, for different doping concentrations. For convenience of graphical representation, W0 is\nscaled to the total weight at \u03c0. Missing points for W1 are\ndue to vanishing spectral weights.\n\nan antiferromagnetic order. A more detailed explanation\ncan be found in Ref.27 . On the contrary, S(q, \u03c9) has its\nmaximum at \u03c0 (see Fig. 5). The appearance of a satellite\npeak at the AFM point located at higher energies can also\nbe noticed. Finally, we remark that, as long as the bare\ncorrelation functions are considered, the total weight is\nlarger in the FS case, almost all over the BZ (away from\n\u03c0), while the highest peak intensities are comparable.\n\nC.\n\nDoping dependence\n\nThe doped Heisenberg model is here considered in\nterms of the single-band t \u2212 J model,65\n\u0013\nX \u0012 \u2020\ne\ne\ndi,\u03c3 di+\u03b4,\u03c3 + h.c.\nHt\u2212J = \u2212 t\nhi,\u03b4i,\u03c3\n\n+J\n\nX\n\nSi * Sj ,\n\n(5)\n\nhi,ji\n\nwhere the sums run over all the hi, ji bonds, counted\nonce, and de operators describe electrons in the d electronic levels with the constraint of no double occupancy.\nBy following the same procedure described in the previous section, we analyze the evolution upon doping of\nthe TS and FS spectra. Two cases are considered: the\nhole concentration nh =1/16 and nh =1/8, respectively.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4 we report the spectra for t/J = 3, a ratio that is typical for corner-sharing cuprate perovskites.\nAs one can see, the spectra are generally softened and\n\n\f6\nbroadened and the intensity of the highest peaks is reduced as nh is increased. This effect is more dramatic at\n\u03c0 for TS, where the peak is strongly damped. In contrast, the doping does not affect substantially the dispersion of the excitation continuum, the only effect being a\ntransfer of spectral weight towards the upper threshold of\nthe two-spinon continuum, with tails in the four-spinon\nregion. Concerning the selection rules, the inelastic intensity is vanishing at q = 0 for both TS and FS, and it\nis suppressed at \u03c0 for O(q, \u03c9).\nConsidering the frequency moments reported in Fig. 5,\ninteresting features come out. Namely, as long as the TS\nis concerned, major differences occur around the AFM\nwave-vector, where W0 strongly decreases with the increases of the doping. This result is somewhat expected\nsince AFM correlations are weakened by doping. The\nevolution of W1 suggests that the average peak position\nstays almost unchanged upon doping; nevertheless it is\nshifted to \u03c9 \u223c 2J approaching \u03c0. As compared to the TS\ncorrelation function, the intensity of the FS appears to be\nrenormalized in a less dramatic way. The total weight is\neven increased in the first half of the BZ (see Fig. 5) and\nthe intensity of the highest peak at \u03c0/2 is much less softened than the corresponding TS at \u03c0. A further look at\nW1 allows to conclude that nh =1/16 leaves the dispersion\nof the average peak position unmodified while, by increasing nh , the dispersion is shifted to slightly higher energies\n(\u03c9 \u223c 2.5J). From these outcomes, we can conclude that\nboth the magnetic dispersions mapped by S(q, \u03c9) and\nO(q, \u03c9) are quite robust against the doping, as long as\nthe lightly doped regime is considered, and we also infer\nthat the robustness of the two-spinon feature is directly\nlinked to the existence of short-range AFM correlations,\nirrespective of doping concentration.\nFinally, concerning the transfer of spectral weight towards the upper threshold of the two-spinon continuum,\nwe may deduce that it can be related to an 'itinerancy\neffect' due to the fact that the introduction of mobile\ncarriers induces charge fluctuations that couple to spin\nexcitations. We note that an analogue effect is known to\nbe played by correlation energy. For a single-band 1D\nHubbard model at half filling, it has been showed that\nfor large values of the on-site repulsion U , the spin correlations are dominated by virtual hopping processes of\nelectrons and are described in terms of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain; in this limit, the spectral weight of spin structure factor S(q, \u03c9) is concentrated at the lower spinon\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nC. -C.

The electron itinerancy may influence the\nmagnetic correlations, and it is found that the spin structure factor of the Hubbard model differs from the spectrum of the Heisenberg model since a significant spectral\nweight is concentrated on the upper spinon boundary.66\nWe therefore infer that in our case those 'itinerancy corrections' arising from charge excitations may be driven\nby doping with holes, both on TS and FS functions.\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFor finite Heisenberg and t \u2212 J chains we have calculated the two-spin (TS) and four-spin (FS) correlation\nfunctions, which determine the magnetic RIXS spectra of\ncuprates. The calculation is performed by means of the\nLanczos algorithm applied to 22-sites Heisenberg and 16sites t \u2212 J models. We firstly show that both functions\nmeasure multi-spinon excitations, and we find that the\ndominant contribution arises from the two-spinon continuum. Depending on which function is considered, one\ncan access to 'polarized' (S = 1) or 'unpolarized' (S = 0)\nexcitations, resulting also in a different momentum dispersion. Then, as long as the Heisenberg model is concerned, one observes that O(q, \u03c9) peaks at \u03c0/2 while\nS(q, \u03c9) peaks at \u03c0, where O(q, \u03c9) vanishes; away from \u03c0,\nthe first has a total weight lower than the latter. When\ndoping is introduced, both the TS and FS spectra are\nsoftened and spread out. The maximum peak intensities\nare strongly renormalized, but the total integrated intensity is slightly modified: the spectra tend to broaden.\nThe TS and FS spectra show a general transfer of spectral weight towards the higher energy sectors of the twospinon band. The main features of the TS and FS spectra, however, exemplified by for instance their zeroth and\nfirst moment, show a remarkable robustness against to\ndoping.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement N.\n264098 - MAMA.
