Introduction\nHeavy-ion collisions at the Relativistc Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) indicate the\nproduction of an opaque (i.e. strongly jet-suppressing) [1], fast-thermalizing medium.\nHowever, so far neither the initial conditions of the collisions nor the microscopic\ndynamics of the jet-energy loss are conclusively understood.\nTo characterize the initial conditions, one usually uses either the Glauber model,\ndescribing incoherent superpositions of proton-proton collisions, or the \"Color Glass\nCondensate\" (CGC), given e.g. by the KLN model, where saturation effects are taken\ninto account [2]. On the other hand, the jet-energy loss can either be described as\nmultiple scatterings of the hard parton [3], specific of a weakly-coupled pQCD medium,\nor using the AdS/CFT correspondence where the problem of a parton stopped in a\nthermal medium is related to the problem of a string falling into a 5-dimensional black\nhole [4].\nFocussing on the different path-length dependences of dE/dx \u223c l for pQCD [3] (as\nit occurs in the presence of coherence effects like in the high-density LPM limit) and\ndE/dx \u223c l2 for AdS/CFT calculations [4], the first simple jet absorption model that\nsimultaneously describes the RAA (Npart ) and the v2 (Npart ) at RHIC energies for high-pT\nparticles was given in Refs. [5]. It showed that after fixing the coupling such that the\n\n\f2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\nv2\n\nv2\n\nJet Tomography and Fluctuating Initial Conditions\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n1.0 0\n0.8\n\n100\n200\n300\nGl., \u03c40=1.00fm\nGl., \u03c40=0.01fm\n\n0\n1.0 0\n0.8\n\n400\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nRAA\n\nRAA\n\nPHENIX\nJia CGC\n\n0.2\n\n100\n200\n300\nKLN, \u03c40=1.00fm\nKLN, \u03c40=0.01fm\n\n400\n\n100\n\n400\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nNpart\n\n300\n\n400\n\n0\n\n200\nNpart\n\n300\n\nFigure 1. RAA and v2 as a function of Npart at a pT = 10 GeV and RHIC energies\nfor Glauber (red lines) and KLN (blue lines) initial conditions. The initialization time\nis either \u03c40 = 1 fm (solid lines) or \u03c40 = 0.01 fm (dashed lines). The data and the black\ndashed-dotted line are taken from Refs. [5].\n\nmost central data point for RAA is reproduced, the RAA (Npart ) can be described for\nboth pQCD and AdS/CFT-like energy loss. However, in case of a pQCD-like energy\nloss, the v2 (Npart ) is underpredicted for both Glauber and CGC initial conditions, while\nfor an AdS/CFT-like energy loss and CGC initial conditions, the v2 (Npart ) can be well\ndescribed.\nHere we want to examine if a generic energy-loss ansatz that includes both a pathlength and an energy dependence confirms the above conclusion that only CGC/KLN\ninitial conditions and an AdS/CFT energy-loss can describe both the RAA (Npart ) and\nthe v2 (Npart ) appropriately.\n2. Jet Tomography\nSince all dependences on the intrinsic scales of the system (Tc , \u039bQCD , etc.) disappear\nin the high-temperature limit, a generic energy-loss rate dE/dx is given by an arbitrary\ncombination of dimensionful parameters constrained by the total dimension of the\nobservable and the requirement that faster particles and hotter media result in a bigger\nsuppression. We choose [6]\ndE\n(~x0 , \u03c6, \u03c4 ) = \u2212 \u03baP a \u03c4 z T z\u2212a+2 [~x0 + n\u0302(\u03c6)\u03c4, \u03c4 ],\n(1)\ndx\nwhere \u03ba is the coupling, P is the momentum of the jet(s) considered and a, z\nare parameters controlling the jet energy (momentum) and path-length dependence,\nrespectively. In the Bethe-Heitler limit a = 1 and z = 0, while in the deep LPM pQCD\n\n\fJet Tomography and Fluctuating Initial Conditions\n\n3\n\nlimit a \u223c 0 and z \u223c 1. If a = 0 and z = 2, our model coincides with the model referred\nto as \"AdS/CFT\" in Refs. [5]. However, on-shell AdS/CFT calculations [4] show that\na = 1/3 and z = 2, thus we are going to consider a = 1/3 throughout the whole\npaper. In a static medium, dE/dx \u223c \u03c4 z , while in a dynamic medium, dE/dx will aquire\nadditional powers of \u03c4 due to the dependence of temperature on \u03c4 . Here, we assume\na 1D Bjorken expansion. In contrast to Refs. [5], \u03ba is a dimensionless parameter. It is\nalways fitted to reproduce the most central value for RAA at RHIC energies.\nChoosing \u03c40 = 1 fm, in line with recent hydrodynamic calculations [7], we see (cf.\nFig. 1) that CGC/KLN initial conditions get close to the RHIC data for both pQCD\nand AdS/CFT-like energy loss, while Glauber initial conditions underpredict the data.\nHowever, choosing a much smaller \u03c40 (in Refs. [5], \u03c40 = 0 fm), the v2 (Npart ) is reduced\nfor both pQCD and AdS/CFT-like energy loss, increasing the difference between the\npQCD and AdS/CFT results as seen in Refs. [5], and raising the question of the physical\nmeaning of \u03c40 .\nSetting \u03c40 = 1 fm means to assume that there is no energy loss within the first fm.\nPQCD does not give any excuse for this assumption and thus \u03c40 = 0 fm would be a\nnatural assumption. However, \u03c40 also describes the formation time of hydrodynamics\nwhich seems to be \u03c40 \u223c 1 fm [7]. On the other hand, setting \u03c40 = 1 fm is also equivalent\nto the AdS/CFT result that the energy loss is suppressed at early times. Please note\nthat for AdS/CFT the dE/dx \u223c l2 \u223c \u03c4 2 dependence leads to a suppressed energy loss at\nearly times where the suppression is larger than in the pQCD case with dE/dx \u223c l \u223c \u03c4 .\nThus, it is important to see that the v2 of high-pT particles is sensitive to shortdistance properties, suggesting that there is either weak coupling with a \u03c40 \u223c 1 fm or\nstrong coupling which in itself features the suppression of energy loss at early times.\nCalculating the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow for pions at LHC\nenergies while keeping the values for a and \u03ba fixed compared to RHIC energies, leads\nto an underprediction of the RAA as a function of centrality as shown in Fig. 2 for both\npQCD and AdS/CFT-like energy loss and different values of the initialization time \u03c40 .\nThis is a puzzle common to all density-dependent energy-loss prescriptions [cf. Eq. (1)],\nas discussed in Ref. [9].\nAcknowledgments\nB.B. is supported by the Alexander von Humboldt foundation via a Feodor Lynen\nfellowship.\nM.G. and B.B. acknowledge support from DOE under Grant No.\nDE-FG02-93ER40764.
