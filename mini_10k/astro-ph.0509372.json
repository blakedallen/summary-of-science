Identification of three candidate cataclysmic variables (CVs) based on HST data (Cool et al. 1995; Grindlay\net al. 1995) was followed by detection of 25 X-ray sources\nwith the Chandra observatory (Grindlay et al. 2001). The\nChandra sources include 8 candidate or confirmed CVs, a\nquiescent low mass X-ray binary and a millisecond pulsar\nPSR J1740 \u2212 5340. The sample of variable stars known in\nthe cluster field contains several pulsating SX Phe stars and\ncontact binaries (Kaluzny 1997; Kaluzny & Thompson 2003,\nhereafter KT03).\nIn this paper, we report the results of a new photometric survey aimed mainly at the identification of detached\neclipsing binaries in the central part of NGC 6397. Such\nobjects can potentially serve as distance and age indicators\nfor the cluster itself (Paczy\u0144ski 1997). The reported survey\n\nis a part of the long-term CASE project, which has been\nconducted for several years at Las Campanas Observatory\n(Kaluzny et al. 2005). Secondary goals of the reported observations included detection of optical variability and a search\nfor possible outbursts of CVs candidates and examination of\nthe stability of the light curve of an optical counterpart to\nthe millisecond pulsar (Ferraro et al. 2001).\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nAll images were taken at Las Campanas Observatory with\nthe 2.5-m duPont telescope. A field of 8.65 \u00d7 4.33 arcmin2\nwas observed with the TEK No. 5 CCD camera at a scale\nof 0.259 arcsec/pixel. The cluster core was positioned 32\narcsec West of the field center. Observations were made on\n14 nights during 4 observing runs conducted from May 2003\nto June 2004. Images were taken in two bands with exposure\ntimes 10-20 s for the V and 20-40 s for the B filters. During\nthe 2003 season observations were limited to the V band\nonly. In total, 1951 frames in V and 288 frames in B were\ncollected and the field was monitored for 55 hours.\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Kaluzny et. al.\n\nThe raw data were pre-processed with the IRAFCCDPROC package.1 Groups of 3-5 consecutive frames were\nco-added, and the total number of stacked images used in\nthe present study was 375 and 85, for V and B bands respectively. The resultant time resolution of our photometry\nbased on combined images is about 5 minutes. The median\nvalue of seeing was 1.01 and 1.02 arcsec for the V and B\nband, respectively.\n\n3\n\nPHOTOMETRY AND IDENTIFICATION OF\nVARIABLES\n\nTo search for variable objects we used the ISIS-2.1 image\nsubtraction package (Alard & Lupton 1998; Alard 2000).\nOur procedure followed closely that described in some detail by Mochejska et al. (2002). Instrumental magnitude zero\npoints for the ISIS differential light curves were measured\nfrom the template images, using the DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR\npackage (Stetson 1987), and aperture corrections were measured with the DAOGROW program (Stetson 1990). Instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the standard\nBV system using a large assembly of local standards established during our earlier study of the same cluster (Kaluzny,\nRuci\u0144ski & Thompson 2003). The monitored field includes 6\nstars from the Stetson (2000) photometric catalog; standard\nV magnitudes are available for all of them. We find mean difference \u2206V = 0.036\u00b10.006, in the sense that our magnitudes\nare brighter. B \u2212 V colors are available for only two Stetson\nstars located in our field. We obtained \u2206(B \u2212 V ) = \u22120.031\nand \u2206(B \u2212 V ) = \u22120.032 for Stetson objects #86 and #88,\nrespectively (our colors are redder). Consequently we have\napplied corrections of \u2206V = 0.036 and \u2206(B \u2212 V ) = \u22120.031\nto our photometry. All photometric quantities listed below\ninclude these corrections.\nTwo methods were used to detect variable objects. The\nfirst method relies on examination of the light curves for\nall stellar objects detectable with the profile photometry on\nthe reference image for the V band. The PHOT procedure in\nthe ISIS package was used to extract differential light curves\nat the position corresponding to each stars detected with\nDAOPHOT/ALLSTAR. The light curves were then transformed to magnitudes and checked for variability using the\nTATRY program written by ASC. This program is suitable\nfor detection of various types of variable stars and in particular uses the AoV algorithm (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996) to\nsearch for the presence of any periodic signal in the analyzed\nlight curves. The second method is based on examination of\nresidual images produced by the ISIS package. In particular\nit allows searching for unresolved variables which were not\ndetected with the profile photometry.\nA total of 30 variables were identified. Their equatorial coordinates are listed in Table 1. The astrometric frame\nsolution was derived using the coordinates of 547 stars extracted from the GSC-2 catalog with the help of the Skycat2.7.3 interface. Names listed in column (1) of Table 1 follow\nClement et al. (2001) for objects V4-24. Variables V25-36\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with\nthe NSF.\n\nFigure 2. Color-magnitude diagram for NGC 6397, with positions of the variables marked. Triangles indicate eclipsing binaries,\ncircles pulsating stars, asterisks CVs, and squares the remaining\nvariables.\n\nare new identifications. Column (2) gives alternate designations used in Grindlay et al. (2001). Columns (5-9) list some\nbasic photometric properties of variables deduced from our\nphotometry. Most of the objects can be classified as periodic\nvariables. For objects V4-24 the listed periods were derived\nfrom photometry including observations from the 2002 season reported in KT03.\nThe finding charts for variables V33=CV3 and\nV34=CV2 can be found in Cool et al. (1995). Variable\nV31 can be unambiguously identified as an object located\nat (X, Y ) = (475, 241) on the HST/WFPC2-PC1 image\nu5dr0401r. The finding charts for the remaining new variables are shown in Fig. 1.\nPositions of the variables on the cluster color-magnitude\ndiagram are shown in Fig. 2.\n3.1\n\nChandra sources\n\nBased on Chandra deep-imaging observations, Grindlay et\nal. (2001) detected 25 X-ray sources within 2\u2032 of the cluster\ncenter. Five of the variables listed in Table 1 can be unambiguously identified as optical counterparts to the Chandra\nsources. These are cataclysmic variables CV1-3 and CV6,\nand an optical companion to the millisecond pulsar PSR\nJ1740-5340 (Ferraro et al. 2001). For these objects we find\nmean difference of equatorial coordinates \u2206\u03b1 = 0.09 \u00b1 0.04\u2032\u2032\nand \u2206\u03b4 = 0.60 \u00b1 0.06\u2032\u2032 , in the sense that Chandra positions\nare to West and South of positions derived from our frame\nsolution. We have added the above listed offsets to coordinates of other sources reported in Grindlay et al. (2001) and\nlooked for their possible counterparts on the list of detected\nvariables. Variable V30 can be considered as a very likely\ncounterpart of the Chandra source U5.

Kaluzny et. al.\n\nwith BY Dra candidate or possible millisecond pulsar based\non analysis of HST/WFPC2 images.\nWe also performed a search for possible variables by\nextracting, with ISIS, light curves at locations corresponding to the Chandra sources. This procedure gave a positive\nresult only for U21=CV4. A clearly variable non-periodic\nobject was detected at the predicted location of that source.\nHowever, due to crowding problems it was impossible to derive profile photometry for it and to transform its light curve\nfrom differential count units into magnitudes. We may only\nnote that Piotto et al. (2002) obtained for CV4 V = 20.68\nand B = 21.49 based on HST/WFPC2 imaging. We did\nnot detect any variable sources at positions corresponding to candidate CVs U22=CV5, U11=CV7, U13=CV8 and\nU28=CV (Grindlay et al. 2001). Source U13 is located 0.8\u2032\u2032\nfrom an SX Phe variable V11, while sources U22 and U28\nare located very close to bright non-variable stars.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nPROPERTIES OF VARIABLES\nCataclysmic variables\n\nPlots of V magnitude against time for cataclysmic variables\nCV1-3 and CV6 for the observing seasons 2002-2004 are\nshown in Fig. 3. Stars V12=CV1 and V13=CV6 were identified as eclipsing CVs in KT03. The light curves of both of\nthem exhibit two distinct minima per orbital period. The\nshape and mean level of the optical light curve of CV6 was\nremarkably stable over three observing seasons. Figure 4\nshows its phased light curve for the 2004 season. It is evident\nthat the accretion rate in this system was roughly constant\nover the last 3 years. Also, the light curve seems to be dominated by ellipsoidal variations. The light curve of variable\nV12=CV1 is less stable than that of CV6. The average V\nmagnitude of the variable increased by about 0.5 mag between the 2002 and 2004 seasons. The unstable character of\nthe light curve of CV1 is demonstrated in Fig. 5, which shows\nphased light curves for 4 selected nights from the 2004 season. These light curves were extracted from individual images and subsequently were smoothed using a box-car filter\nwith N = 3. Effective time resolution is about 80 seconds.\nBesides overall changes of the shape of the eclipse, one may\nnotice the presence of non-periodic oscillations and/or flickering with \u2206V reaching about 0.15 mag. Such oscillations\nwere not observed during the 2002 season. Our photometry\nof CV1 and CV6 fails to reveal any periodicities other than\nthose related to the orbital periods. However, the limited\ntime resolution of our data does not allow us to rule out the\noccurrence of short period oscillations with a time scale of\nthe order of 10s like those observed in DQ Her type CVs or\nin some dwarf novae.\nThe light curve of variable V34=CV2 does not show\nany periodicity although changes of V magnitude exceeding\n1 magnitude were observed on several nights. The variable\nexhibited a likely dwarf nova type outburst in the first half of\nMay 2003. At that time it reached < V >\u2248 16.5, which corresponds to MV \u2248 4.3 for an assumed cluster membership.\nThere is no evidence for the presence of any superhumps\nduring the event. Unfortunately we have failed to obtain\nany color information during the outburst.\nThe variable V33=CV3 was observed at 19.1 < V <\n\nFigure 4. Phased V light curve of V13=CV6 for the observing\nseason 2004.\n\n19.9 in 2002 and at 18.3 < V < 19.5 in 2004. On some nights\nnon-periodic changes of V exceeding 0.8 mag were seen. In\nMay 2003 the star was found in a low state with V > 22.0.\nSeveral measurements for that run indicate V > 22.5 mag,\nalthough with formal errors exceeding 0.4 mag. Still, one\nmay conclude that in May 2003 the variable was certainly\nbelow V = 22.0, corresponding to MV > 9.8.\nGrindlay et al. (1995) reported spectroscopic observations of CV1-3 obtained with the HST Faint Object Spectrograph. They noted in particular the presence of He II\n\u03bb4686 emission lines in all three objects. That, in turn, lead\nto the conclusion that CV1-3 are likely magnetic CVs. Our\ndata are insufficient to rule out the possibility that these\nsystems indeed belong to the DQ Her type magnetic systems. However, the presented light curves do not support\nthe hypothesis that any of the observed systems belongs to\npolars or intermediate polars.\n4.2\n\nEclipsing binaries\n\nThe main objective of our observing program was the detection of detached eclipsing binaries belonging to the clusters.\nWe hardly succeeded in that respect despite quite extensive\ntime coverage (87 hours for the inner 8.65 \u00d7 2.6 armin2 field\nand 55 hours for the larger 8.65 \u00d7 4.3 armin2 field). Two\nnew eclipsing systems were identified. A single eclipse event\nwith \u2206V = 0.5 mag was observed for the variable V31.\nThis object, possessing an X-ray counterpart, is most likely\na foreground binary of late spectral type. With Vmax = 17.4\nand B \u2212 V = 1.28 it is located far to the red of the main\nsequence on the cluster color-magnitude diagram.\nA very likely eclipsing event with \u2206V \u2248 0.03 mag was detected for the variable V32. As one can see in Fig. 6 a flatbottomed part of eclipse and egress were observed on the\nnight of 11 April 2004. We checked carefully that the observed event was not caused by any sort of instrumental effects. There is also no evidence in our data that the photometry of variable is affected by any unresolved blends reducing\nthe observed depth of a possible eclipse. Unfortunately, the\nvariable is located outside the fields covered by HST images currently available publicly. Hence, we cannot exclude\nthe possibility that, in fact, the shallowness of the observed\n\n\fVariable stars in NGC 6397\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Time domain V light curves of observed CVs for the period 2002-2004. Each box covers the time interval of 10 days.\n\neclipse like event is due to the presence of more than one star\ninside the fitted profile of V32. The variable is located right\nat the top of the cluster turnoff on the color-magnitude diagram (see Fig. 2). The light curve of V32, including 32 hours\nof photometry from the 2002 season, can be phased with a\nwide range of periods but 10 shortest of them are within a\nrange 1.011038-1.060271 d. Other possible short periods are\ngrouped near 2.05 and 4.15 d. It is tempting to speculate\nthat the shallow transit like event observed in V32 is caused\nby a large planet or brown dwarf orbiting the turnoff star\nfrom NGC 6397. Such a possibility can be tested by spectroscopic observations as well as by further photometry aimed\nat determination of the orbital period and detailed analysis\nof shape of the eclipse. In particular, determination of the\norbital period at P \u2248 1 d would rule out a planetary transit\nhypothesis as it implies too wide eclipses lasting about 0.1P.\nSpectroscopic observations could on the other hand eliminate the possibility that V32 is a hierarchical triple system\nincluding an eclipsing binary (eg. Torres et al. 2004).\n\n4.3\n\nThe optical companion to PSR J1740-5340\n\nThe variable V16 is an optical companion to the millisecond\npulsar PSR J1740-5340 (D'Amico et al. 2001; Ferraro et al.\n2001). Its variability is explained by the ellipsoidal effect.\n\nThe star has been recently a subject of detailed photometric\nand spectroscopic studies (Kaluzny, Rucinski & Thompson\n2003; Ferraro et al. 2003; Orosz & van Kerkwijk 2003; Sabbi\net al. 2003). In particular, modeling of the light curve served\nas a basis for constraining the orbital inclination of the system. It has been noted in Kaluzny et al. (2003) that the\noptical light curve of V16 exhibits some seasonal changes of\nits shape and amplitude. That claim is further supported by\nour new data. The phased V light and color curves of V16\nincluding the data from 2002-2004 seasons are shown in Fig.\n7. Changes of the light curve level reaching 0.03 mag at a\ngiven phase are clearly visible. In particular we observed the\noccurrence of changes with \u2206V \u2248 0.03 mag within the 2004\nobserving season spanning about 100 days. The color curve\nshows small orbital variations and the color becomes redder at the upper and lower conjunctions (at phase 0.5 the\nobserver sees the side of the optical companion facing the\npulsar). As was already noted in Ferraro et al. (2003), the\nlack of pronounced orbital variations of the color index is\npuzzling, considering detection of high excitation He I absorption lines in the spectrum of V16.\n\n\f6\n\nJ.

We decided,\nhowever, to provide a list of periods detectable in our time\nseries photometry. As it turns out, all the objects show\nmulti-periodic pulsations which is a very common property\nof low amplitude SX Phe stars (eg. Rodr\u00edguez & Breger\n2001).\nAnalysis of observations of SX Phe stars was repeated in\ntwo different ways: either by iterations involving alternative\nperiod search and prewhitening of the original data with\nall periods identified so far, or by successive prewhitening\nof one period at a time and period search in the residuals.\nFor period search we employed the multi-harmonic analysis\nof variance periodogram (mhAoV, Schwarzenberg-Czerny,\n1996). The periodogram is based on fitting data with an\northogonal Fourier series. In the present case the series involved the fundamental frequency and its first harmonic.\nThis aided in identification of the stronger, non-sinusoidal\nmodes without much affecting detection of the faint, sinusoidal modes. The advantage in employing Fourier series, as\nopposed to a plain sinusoid, is two-fold: harmonics tend to\nincrease the detected power and they no longer contribute to\nthe residual noise. Fourier series or phase binning in any pe-\n\n\fVariable stars in NGC 6397\n\n7\n\nFigure 9. Phased light curves of variables V28 and V36.\n\n5\n\nFigure 8. Phased light curves of new candidate ellipsoidal variables.\n\nriodogram produce sub-harmonics as their side effect. These\npose no practical difficulty as they stand-out by their tight\nspacing of aliases.\nResults of the analysis are presented in Table 2 which for\neach star lists an amplitude for the strongest mode of pulsation along with all detected frequencies.\n\n4.5\n\nOther variables\n\nThe old variable V22 can be now classified as a double\nmode RRd variable located in the cluster background. The\navailable data allow preliminary determination of the fundamental period and its first overtone at P 0 = 0.52 d and\nP 1 = 0.344 d, respectively.\nFour objects from the sample of newly detected variables\nwere classified preliminarily as ellipsoidal variables. Their\nlight curves show periodic sinusoidal modulations. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 8, which shows phased light curves for the\nrelevant stars. In the case of V31 the observed scatter reflects mainly the change of average magnitude between 2003\nand 2004 seasons. Spectroscopic data are needed to verify\nthe proposed classification and to establish the membership\nstatus of these stars.\nFigure 9 shows light curves of V28 and V36 phased with the\nperiods listed in Table 2. These two stars are preliminarily classified as pulsating variables as stability of their light\ncurves seems to exclude belonging to spotted variables.\nThe light curve of V25 for the 2004 observing season showed\nperiodic modulation with P = 1.2306 d. However, this periodicity is absent in the data from the 2003 season.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOur observing program was focused on the detection of detached eclipsing binaries in NGC 6397. Although two such\nobjects were identified, none of them can serve as an age or\ndistance indicator for the cluster. The binary V30 is most\nlikely a foreground field star. The second object, V32, has a\ngood chance of being a cluster member but showed a single,\nvery shallow eclipse. It could be composed of a cluster upper\nmain sequence star orbited by a dim companion being a large\nplanet or brown dwarf. Another possibility is that we have\nobserved a grazing eclipse in an otherwise normal binary.\nHowever, the shape of the light curve inside the observed\neclipse does not favor the latter alternative. At V = 16.1\nthe star is sufficiently bright for spectroscopic follow-up observations.\nOur sample includes several candidates for ellipsoidal variables. Some of them, primarily these located among blue\nstragglers or close to the cluster main sequence, are also interesting candidates for spectroscopic follow-up. Because of\ntheir location in post-core-collapse cluster some of them may\nbe detached binaries with degenerate components.\nBased on observations from 3 observing seasons we have\nrefined the determination of orbital periods for two cataclysmic variables, CV1 and CV6. A very likely dwarf nova\ntype outburst was detected for the variable CV4. None of\nthe four observed CVs showed any evidence of photometric\nvariability pointing to its association with magnetic systems.\nFinally, our extensive and homogeneous photometry shows\nunambiguously that the light curve of the optical companion\nto the millisecond pulsar PSR J1740-5340 exhibits seasonal\nchanges of its amplitude.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nJK was supported by the grant 1 P03D 024 26 from the\nMinistry of Scientific Research and Informational Technology, Poland.\n\nREFERENCES\nAlard C., Lupton R.
