We update our previous constraints on two-component hot dark matter\n(axions and neutrinos), including the recent WMAP 5-year data release. Marginalising\nP\nover\nm\u03bd provides ma < 1.02 eV (95% C.L.) for the axion mass. In the absence of\nP\naxions we find\nm\u03bd < 0.63 eV (95% C.L.).\n\n\fCosmological constraints on neutrino plus axion hot dark matter\n\n2\n\nVery recently the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) experiment has\npublished its 5-year result for the angular power spectra of the temperature and the\npolarisation variations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, superseding their\nprevious 3-year measurements [1, 2]. We use this opportunity to update our previous\nlimits on the cosmological abundance of hot dark matter in the form of ordinary\nneutrinos as well as axions [3]. We recall that axions in the eV mass range thermally\ndecouple after the QCD phase transition and thus form a hot dark matter component.\nCold dark matter axions, on the other hand, have much smaller masses, corresponding\nto a much larger Peccei\u2013Quinn scale. These axions are produced nonthermally before\nand during the QCD phase transition. Our update concerns the former variety of hot,\nthermal axions, and is performed for the benefit of those interested in limits based on\nthe latest set of data.\nThe analysis of the WMAP 5-year data (WMAP-5) is performed using version 3\nof the likelihood calculation package provided by the WMAP team on the LAMBDA\nhomepage [4], and follows closely the analyses of references [5, 6]. Other data sets used\nin this work and our parameter estimation methodology are described in our previous\npaper [3], in which we also provide references to the literature.\nWe consider here only the \"baseline case\" of our previous study: We do not include\ninformation from the Lyman-\u03b1 forest, and use only standard axion couplings to pions.\n\nP\nFigure 1. 2D marginal 68% and 95% contours in the m\u03bd -ma plane derived from the\nstandard data set of our previous paper (excluding Lyman-\u03b1 forest). The blue/solid\nlines correspond to our new results using WMAP-5, while the red/dashed lines are our\nprevious constraints derived from WMAP-3.\n\n\fCosmological constraints on neutrino plus axion hot dark matter\n\n3\n\nFigure 1 shows our results in the form of 2D marginal 68% and 95% contours in the\nP\nm\u03bd -ma plane. The blue/solid lines are our updated contours, the red/dashed lines\nare our previous results using the WMAP 3-year data (WMAP-3). The modifications\nare very minor. Marginalising over neutrino masses, our new axion mass limit is\nma < 1.02 eV (95% C.L.),\n\n(1)\n\nabout 20% tighter than our previous limit. Conversely, the neutrino mass limit after\nmarginalisation over the axion mass is\nX\n\nm\u03bd < 0.59 eV (95% C.L.),\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is identical to our old result.\nThese changes are also reflected in the 2D contours in Fig. 1, where a shrinkage in\nP\nthe allowed region in the ma direction, but not in the m\u03bd direction, is apparent. The\nreason for this is a better measurement of the early integrated Sachs\u2013Wolfe effect by\nWMAP-5, which in turn limits any nonstandard effect due to extra light free-streaming\nspecies around the epoch of matter\u2013radiation equality. For comparison, we also derive\na new neutrino mass limit assuming a complete absence of axions,\nX\n\nm\u03bd < 0.63 eV (95% C.L.).\n\n(3)\n\nThese limits are expected to become more restrictive with the inclusion of smallerscale data such as the Lyman-\u03b1 forest which, however, we consider too vulnerable to\nsystematic uncertainties. We also note that the WMAP-5 favoured value of \u03c38 is slightly\nlarger than the WMAP-3 value [6]. The very strong neutrino mass bound obtained in\nreference [7] from the inclusion of Lyman-\u03b1 arose partially because the \u03c38 value inferred\nfrom the SDSS Lyman-\u03b1 data is significantly higher than that from WMAP-3. Therefore\nthe fact that the WMAP-5 and the SDSS Lyman-\u03b1 measurements of \u03c38 are in better\nagreement presumably will relax the hot dark matter mass bound from CMB+Lyman-\u03b1\ndata to some extent.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge use of computing resources from the Danish Center for Scientific\nComputing (DCSC) and partial support by the European Union under the ILIAS\nproject (contract No. RII3-CT-2004-506222), by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\nunder the grant TR-27 \"Neutrinos and Beyond\" and by The Cluster of Excellence for\nFundamental Physics \"Origin and Structure of the Universe\" (Garching and Munich).\nA.M. is supported by a grant of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\nReferences\n[1] G.
