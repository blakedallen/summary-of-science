Resulting models, even\nthough much simpler than the original field theories, can be rather complex\nand with nontrivial solution. In the programme proposed in [3], the hamiltonian is diagonalized in the limited Hilbert space providing the complete\nspectrum of the system with a cutoff. Then the cutoff is gradually removed\nand convergence towards the exact (i.e. the infinite Hilbert space) spectrum\nis observed. Interestingly, even for quite complex systems with 15 degrees\nof freedom the convergence occurs before the size of the basis grows out of\ncontrol [4, 5, 6].\nAbove method, which is essentially numerical, raises a number of theoretical questions about exact solutions of quantum mechanics in a limited\nHilbert space. Some of them will be addressed in this paper. In the next\nSection we define the cutoff as the maximal number of harmonic oscillator\nquanta, N. Then we solve analytically for the spectrum of the momentum\nand coordinate operators at arbitrary finite N. In Section 4 the asymptotic\nbehaviour for large N is derived and the new scaling law required to recover\nthe infinite Hilbert space limit is formulated. The universality of the above\nscaling and similarity of the whole procedure to the familiar continuum limit\nin lattice field theories is discussed. It is also shown that present results prove\nthe assertion of Ref.[3] that the continuous spectrum in quantum mechanics\ngives rise to the power-like dependence on the cutoff. On the other hand, it\nwas found numerically, that the eigenenergies of the discrete, localized states\nhave much faster convergence. This correlation between the nature of the\nspectrum and the cutoff dependence is very useful in studying supersymmetric systems where the distinction between continuous and discrete spectra is\nan important issue [7, 8].\nA general idea of increasing the number of states in a trial wave function\nis of course not new and is closely connected with the classical variational\ncalculations1 . However we are not aware of any systematic studies of the\ncutoff dependence based on the exact solutions of cut systems, especially in\nthe context of contrasting the discrete and continuous spectra.\n1\n\nFor some applications for gauge systems see e.g. [9, 10, 11, 12].\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nA cut Fock space\n\nEvery quantum hamiltonian can be written in terms of the creation and\nannihilation operators of a simple, normalized harmonic oscillator\nH(Q, P ) = H(a, a\u2020 ),\nwhere\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nQ = (a + a\u2020 )/ 2, P = (a \u2212 a\u2020 )/i 2,\n\n(1)\n[a, a\u2020 ] = 1.\n\n(2)\n\nAnd similarly for the fermionic degrees of freedom if required. It follows that\na large class of polynomial hamiltonians has a simple representation in the\neigenbasis {|n >} of the occupation number operator a\u2020 a.\nn\n\na\u2020\n|n >= \u221a |0 > .\nn!\n\n(3)\n\nApart from the theoretical simplicity, this basis has an important practical\nadvantage. It is labeled by a discrete index n and consequently is well suited\nfor numerical applications.\nTherefore a straightforward method for numerical solution of any quantum problem consists of: a) limiting the basis, Eq. (3), to e.g. n \u2264 N; b)\ncalculating the finite matrix representation of the hamiltonian (1) in such\na cut basis; and c) numerically diagonalizing above finite matrix to obtain\ncomplete spectrum and the eigenstates of the system. Moreover, changing\nthe cutoff N provides the model independent way to estimate the systematic\nerrors introduced by limiting the number of allowed quanta.\nIt is evident that theoretical understanding of the cutoff dependence for\nvarious quantum mechanical systems would further extend applicability of\nthis approach. In particular, the knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe eigenvalues of a cut hamiltonian for large N could be used to perform\nquantitative extrapolation to the infinite cutoff limit. We begin studying\nthese questions with the simplest building blocks of any hamiltonian, i.e. the\nP and Q operators.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nThe spectrum of cut momentum and coordinate operators\n\nStandard expressions for the matrix elements of the P and Q operators in\nthe occupation number basis read.\n1\nhn | P | ki =\ni\nhn | Q | ki =\n\ns\n\ns\n\n1\nk\n\u03b4n,k\u22121 \u2212\n2\ni\n\nk\n\u03b4n,k\u22121 +\n2\n\ns\n\ns\n\nk+1\n\u03b4n,k+1,\n2\n\nk+1\n\u03b4n,k+1.\n2\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nIn the Hilbert space, limited to maximum N quanta, P and Q become (N +\n1) \u00d7 (N + 1) matrices. Hence, the eigenvalues, \u03bb, of e.g. momentum, are\ngiven by the zeros of the following determinant\n\u221a\n\u2212\u03b7\n1 \u221a0 . .\n.\n\u221a\n\u2212 1 \u2212\u03b7\n2. .\n.\n\u221a\n.\n0 \u2212 2 \u2212\u03b7 . .\n,\n(6)\nIN +1 =\n.\n.\n. . . \u221a.\nN\n.\n.\n. . \u2212\u03b7\n\u221a\n.\n.\n. . \u2212 N \u2212\u03b7\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b7 = i 2\u03bb. Laplace expansion gives, for the simpler variable Jn =\nIn /n!, the following recursion relation\n1\n(n + 2)Jn+2 + \u03b7Jn+1 \u2212 Jn = 0, J1 = \u2212\u03b7, J2 = (\u03b7 2 + 1),\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is closely related to the well known recursion for the Hermite polynomials. We find\nn\n(8)\nIn (\u03bb) = 2\u2212 2 in Hn (\u2212\u03bb).\nIt follows that the spectrum of the momentum in the cut Hilbert space\nwith maximum N quanta is given by the zeroes of the Hermite polynomials\nHN +1 (z)\n(N +1)\npN\n,\nm = zm\n\nwhere\n\n(N +1)\nHN +1 (zm\n) = 0,\n\nThis constitutes the main result of present paper.\n4\n\nm = 1, 2, . . . , N + 1.\n\n(9)\n\n\fCalculations for the coordinate operator Q are very similar. Resulting\nN\neigenvalues, qm\n, are identical\nN\n(N +1)\nqm\n= zm\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich could have been expected from the duality between P and Q. It is\nimportant that this duality is not violated by our cutoff. Of course the\neigenvectors of P and Q are different. Since the eigenvalues are symmetric\nwith respect to the origin, we will use only positive ones. Hence, we introduce\na slightly different enumeration\nN\nN\nN\nN\npN\n0 < p1 < p2 < . . . < pm < . . . \u2264 pN/2 , N \u2212 even,\n\npN\n1\n\n<\n\npN\n2\n\n< ... <\n\npN\nm\n\n< ... \u2264\n\npN\n(N +1)/2 ,\n\nN \u2212 odd.\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwhich will be used in the next Section.\n\n4\n\nContinuum limit - scaling\n\nRestricting the infinite Hilbert space by artificially cutting off the basis of\nthe Fock states has some resemblance to the familiar discretization in a lattice field theory. In both situations a cutoff makes a problem numerically\ntractable and in the end it has to be removed to reach a physical description\nof the continuous world. In lattice calculations this is much more delicate due\nto the infinite number of degrees of freedom, and must be accompanied with\na nontrivial adjustment (scaling) of bare parameters. Interestingly, similar\nphenomenon is observed when we increase the size of the Hilbert space in\nour cut quantum mechanics in order to recover standard quantum system.\nTo see this, consider the large N limit of the spectrum of the momentum\noperator derived in the previous Section. From the known asymptotics of\nthe roots of Hermite polynomials [13] we obtain (see Appendix)\npN\nm = \u221a\n\n\u03c0m\n2N + 3\n\nv\nu\nu\nt1 +\nv\n\n1 u\n)u\n2 t\n\n\u03c0(m \u2212\npN\nm = \u221a\n2N + 3\n\n1+\n\n\u03c0 2 m2 \u2212 3/2\n+ O(N \u22124.5 ),\n2\n3(2N + 3)\n\n(13)\n\n\u03c0 2 (m \u2212 12 )2 \u2212 3/2\n+ O(N \u22124.5 ),\n3(2N + 3)2\n\n(14)\n\nwith m and N as in (11) and (12) respectively. Therefore an infinite N limit\nat fixed m is trivial and does not reproduce the spectrum of the P operator in\n5\n\n\fthe infinite Hilbert space. On the other hand varying the \"principal quantum\nnumber\" m with the cutoff N according to the following prescription\n\u221a\n2N\nm=\np,\n(15)\n\u03c0\ndefines the scaling limit of our quantum system\nlimN \u2192\u221e pN\nm(N,p) = p,\n\n(16)\n\nwhich reproduces the known spectrum of the momentum for any real eigenvalue p. Because of the above analogy with the lattice approach, the adjustment (15) will be called scaling and we will refer to the scaling limit, Eq.(16),\nas the continuum limit.\nA number of comments is in order here. First, for finite\n\u221a cutoff N, the N +1\neigenvalues, Eq.(14),\u221a\nspan the interval of the length O( N) and are separated\nby the distance O(1/ N ). When N tends to infinity they spread out covering\nthe whole real axis and, at the same time, become more dense approximating\nany real number p with arbitrary precision. In another words, limiting the\nnumber of quanta can be thought of as regularizing the system both in the\ninfrared and in the ultraviolet. This means that the single dimensionless\nparameter N controls both the continuum limit and the infinite volume limit\nat the same time.\nSecond, the scaling, Eq.(15), is universal, i.e. it applies to the spectrum\nof any operator which commutes with P . For example, it was found [14] that\nthe spectrum of a cut free particle hamiltonian, H = P 2 /2, behaves at large\nN as\n\u03c0 2 (m \u2212 1/2)2\n,\n2 2N + 5\n\u03c0 2 m2\n=\n,\n2 2N + 5\n\nN\nEm\n=\nN\nEm\n\n(17)\n\nfor N even and odd respectively. This implies, together with (15), the standard spectral relation E(p) = p2 /2 in the continuum limit. Note that the\nscaling deduced only from the momentum variable was sufficient to derive\nthe continuum limit of the energy 2 .\n2\n\nOf course we also needed the solution of the free particle problem in a cut Fock space.\n\n6\n\n\fThird, this universality should also extend to any scattering problem in\nquantum mechanics, that is to less trivial hamiltonians with continuous spectra, provided the momenta can be defined asymptotically. This observation\nis particularly useful for studying nonlocalized solutions of supersymmetric\nsystems.\nFinally we stress the difference in the cutoff dependence between the\neigenenergies of the localized and nonlocalized states. Results (14) and (17)\nprove that for the continuous spectrum the eigenenergies fall as a power of\nthe cutoff. On the other hand there is a strong numerical evidence that in\nthe case of the discrete, localized eigenstates the convergence of the eigenenergies is much faster, probably exponential or even stronger . The difference\nbetween the two is so dramatic that it was successfully used to distinguish\nbetween both classes of solutions from the finite N data alone [3, 4, 5, 6].\nThe scaling (15) applies only to the continuous spectrum. Continuum limit\nof the eigenenergies from the discrete spectrum is achieved simply by taking\nlarge N at fixed m.\nTo conclude this Section we derive the form of the large N corrections to\nthe continuous spectrum. Let us use a slightly more general form of (15)\n\u221a\n2N\nm=\np + b,\n(18)\n\u03c0\nwith arbitrary real b. Inserting Eq.(18) into (13) and regrouping terms according to their N dependence gives\n1\n1\n1 1\n+ p(p2 \u2212 9)\npN\nm = p + \u03c0(b \u2212 ) \u221a\n2 2N\n6\n2N\n\u03c0\n1 2\n1\n+ (b \u2212 )( p2 \u2212 3)\n3 + ...\n2\n2 3\n(2N) 2\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nThe parameter b can be used to speed up the convergence. Obviously b = 1/2\nis optimal in this case, however this choice is not universal in general. In\nfact we readily see this even in our example. For even number of quanta,\nEq.(13), the best choice is b =\nremark applies if one improves\n\u221a 0. The same \u221a\nthe convergence by replacing 2N by , e.g. 2N + 3 in (15). Of course the\nlimiting value of the momentum is independent of b in agreement with the\nuniversality.\n\n7\n\n\f5\n\nSummary and outlook\n\nQuantum mechanics in a cut Hilbert space is an interesting theoretical framework admitting a number of exact solutions which, to our knowledge, have\nnever been obtained before. Apart from its theoretical and pedagogical significance, analytical understanding of the cutoff dependence of the solutions\nprovides the useful practical tool to study more complex systems.\nScaling found in the spectrum of the cut momentum operator seems to\nbe a general property of nonlocalized states. It was confirmed in the simple case of a free particle in one dimension and we are currently extending\nthis to higher dimensions. Many other applications, with various degree of\ncomplexity, are possible. One of the most interesting is the study of the\nscattering states in the family of supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum mechanical systems with the flat valleys potentials (SYMQM). Reduced from\nthe two dimensional space-time (D=2) theory, SYMQM is essentially the\nquantum mechanics of a free particle in three (color) dimensions with a constraint [6]. Thus it can be readily analyzed with the present method. The\nD=4 system is already nontrivial, revealing both the discrete and continuum spectrum [3]. Since one can assign a momentum along the valley to the\nasymptotic scattering sates, we expect that above scaling should also work in\nthis case. Recent numerical progress in solving this system in a cut Hilbert\nspace makes this programme rather feasible now. Finally, in the most complex D=10 SYMQM, with its threshold bound state and the continuum of\nthe scattering states, one can also assign an asymptotic momentum to these\nstates [15, 16]. Hence the momentum scaling found here should be used in\nextracting the continuum limit of this model from its cut formulation.\nAcknowledgments JW thanks the Theory Group of Pisa University for their\nhospitality.
