As shown by Bell [1] and Kochen-Specker [2], quantum mechanics portrays\na picture of the world in which reality loses its objectivity and is in fact created by observation. Quantum mechanics predicts phenomena which cannot be\nexplained by any theory with objective realism, although our everyday experience supports the hypothesis that macroscopic objects, despite being made\nof quantum particles, exist independently of the act of observation; in this paper we identify this behavior as classical. Here we show that this seemingly\nobvious classical behavior of the macroscopic world cannot be experimentally\ntested and belongs to the realm of ontology similar to the dispute on the interpretations of quantum mechanics [3, 4]. For small systems such as a single\nphoton [5] or a pair [6], it has been experimentally proven that a classical description cannot be sustained. Recently, there have also been experiments that\nclaim to have demonstrated quantum behavior of relatively large objects such as\ninterference of fullerenes [7], the violation of Leggett-Garg inequality in Josephson junction [8], and interference between two condensed clouds of atoms [9],\nwhich suggest that there is no limit to the size of the system on which the\nquantum-versus-classical question can be tested. These behaviors, however, are\nnot sufficient to refute classical description in the sense of objective reality. Our\nfindings show that once we reach the regime where an Avogadro number of\nparticles is present, the quantum-versus-classical question cannot be answered\nexperimentally.\nThere is only one known experimental test capable of distinguishing between classical\n(objective realistic) theories and non-classical ones. This test is based on the celebrated\npaper by Kochen and Specker [2] and exploits a simple observation that is at the root of\nthe discrepancy between classical and non-classical behavior. Imagine a physical system on\nwhich a set of N measurements can be performed that are represented by some physical\n(i)\n\nobservables A1 , A2 , . . . , AN . Each observable yields outcomes of measurements aj\nprobability distribution\n\n(i)\np(aj ).\n\nwith\n\nThe physical system is classical if and only if there exists a\n\njoint probability distribution of the outcomes of measurements for all involved observables\n2\n\n\f(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(N )\n\np(aj , aj 0 , . . . , aj 00 ) [10]. Indeed, known classical theories such as Maxwell electrodynamics\nand general relativity satisfy this property. One can immediately have doubts whether this\nis true in quantum theory because some observables in this theory are incompatible. For\ninstance, observables position X and momentum P cannot be measured simultaneously as\nis neatly expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. However, this does not prevent\none from constructing a joint probability distribution for X and P as P rob(X = x, P =\np) = P rob(X = x)P rob(P = p). This probability distribution directly reproduces observed\nmarginal probabilities for both position and momentum measurements P rob(X = x) =\nR\nR\ndpP rob(X = x, P = p), P rob(P = p) = dxP rob(X = x, P = p). This simple example\nteaches us that we need more than incompatibility of measurements to demonstrate the\nnon-existence of a joint probability distribution. We require measurements that can be\nperformed in different contexts, the simplest example being an observable A that can be\nmeasured together with an observable B or with C such that B and C cannot be measured\nsimultaneously. In quantum mechanics, this is written as [A, B] = [A, C] = 0 and [B, C] 6= 0,\nwhere B and C are understood to provide two different contexts for the measurement of\nA (Fig. 1). In any non-contextual theory, the outcome of the measurement of A does not\ndepend on whether it was co-measured with B or with C. To show that quantum theory\nis a contextual theory, i.e., it does not allow for a joint probability distribution, one needs\nmore than two contexts as shown in [2]. For a spin-1 system, the lack of the joint probability\ndistribution has been experimentally confirmed in [5, 11]. If one wants to perform a similar\nexperiment on a macroscopic system it is necessary to find a set of observables such that\nsome of them commute and some do not.\nHowever in the macroscopic regime, the class of measurements that can be performed is\nlimited to a small set of feasible measurements. For simplicity, let us consider a magnetic\nsystem consisting of N spin-s particles. Despite the generalized spin measurement proposal\nin [12], when the number of spins becomes too large (N \u2248 1023 ), feasible measurements will\nbe limited to measurements of magnetization in some direction ~n. These are given by a set\nof projectors of the form\nPm (~n) =\n\nX\n\nPk1 (~n) \u2297 * * * \u2297 PkN (~n),\n\n(1)\n\nk1 +***+kN =m\n\nwhere each ki = \u2212s, \u2212s + 1, . . . s and m corresponds to different degrees of magnetization.\nThis limitation on the set of measurements that can be performed is imposed by the following\n3\n\n\fFIG. 1: Each ellipsoid denotes a set of mutually commuting observables. The observable \u039b belongs\nto all three sets. Observables in different sets do not commute. The observable \u039b can be measured\nin three different contexts, for instance it can be measured either with Ak or with B1 or with C3 .\nWe say that the three observables Ak , B1 , C3 provide contexts for the measurement of \u039b. Note\nthat the proof of KS requires both commutativity that provides contexts and non-commutativity\nthat makes it impossible to perform simultaneous measurements in different contexts.\n\ntwo factors.\nThe first restriction is imposed by the fact that a physical description for a system consisting of a large number of particles N can only be done by statistical theories. The basic\nassumption in these theories is that one cannot know the exact micro-state of the system\nand is hence forced to assume a priori that all micro-states leading to the same macro-state\nare equally probable. One of the consequences of this assumption is that any observable that\ncan be measured must not distinguish between micro-states having the same macroscopic\nproperty. Indeed, all states corresponding to a given property belong to a permutationally invariant subspace; this in turn implies effective indistinguishability of the particles\nand yields the form of the projectors in equation (1). This permutational invariance of the\nprojectors is therefore a key feature of feasible measurements on any macroscopic system.\nThe second restriction is due to the fact that, for spin systems, magnetization dominates\nmore exotic multipole moments. In principle it is possible to measure the k-pole moment of\n\n4\n\n\fmagnetization for a spin-s particle, where k \u2264 2s + 1 [12]. Therefore, there is no theoretical\nlimitation to measuring a macroscopic k-pole observable that, analogous to magnetization,\nis a sum of k-pole moments of all spins in the system. However, the electromagnetic fields\nrequired for measuring the k-pole moments are infeasible to implement in practice. Moreover,\nhigher moments such as susceptibility are not suitable observables to study contextuality\nas they deal with states that are varying in time. Hence, the feasible measurements for\nmacroscopic spin systems are restricted to magnetization.\nThe main result of this work is that for macroscopic systems the question of quantumversus-classical is undecidable, i.e., is not experimentally testable. This is because for macroscopic measurements there is no context. We show that [Pm (~n), Pm0 (~n0 )] = 0 if and only if\n~n = \u00b1~n0 (Fig. 2). Details of the proof can be found in the supplementary material. The\nproof holds mainly due to the fact that the restrictions on the feasible measurements force\nthe measurable obeservables to be related by three-dimensional spatial rotations instead of\nmuch more complex rotations in the Hilbert space. This undecidability sheds new light on\nthe quantum-versus-classical question suggesting that it may be forever unanswerable.\nInterestingly, it was shown in [13] that the quantumness of the correlations between\ncomposite macroscopic objects is experimentally testable and conforms with (local) realism.\nThis situation resembles the case of a single qubit versus a pair of qubits. The quantumness\nof a single qubit is fundamentally undecidable [14, 15] because no contexts can be found\nfor any measurements, whereas the correlations between two qubits are decidable and for\nentangled states can be shown to be quantum [6].\nIt is important to note that the various notions of quantumness, such as interference and\nthe violation of Leggett-Garg inequality [7\u20139], have been introduced in the literature. The\nexperiments mentioned in the introductory paragraph may confirm the quantumness of physical systems according to one of these notions. They do not, however, involve measurements\nof different contexts and hence do not refute the existence of objective reality.\nTo conclude, we showed that the restricted set of measurements in macroscopic systems\nleads to a simplification of quantum theory that prevents the testability of certain nonintuitive features such as contextuality while still preserving other features such as entanglement [13, 16]. Similar behavior was observed in a toy model of quantum theory proposed in\n[17]. An interesting open question is to investigate the complexity of measurements needed\nfor contextuality to emerge. A further question could be to identify the exact trade-off be5\n\n\fFIG. 2: Graphical representation of spin-1 (the smallest contextual system) states along two dif\u221a\nferent directions ~n, ~n0 . Spin-1 can be represented as a vector of length 2 in three dimensional\nspace and has three values along any measurement direction, +1, 0, \u22121, therefore we have three\narrows per direction. Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty only one coordinate of the spin vector\ncan be determined, namely the one along the measurement direction. The other two coordinates\nremain undetermined hence for each measurement outcome along direction ~n (or ~n0 ) the tip of the\nspin vector is spread over the rim of the corresponding circle. Red circles depict the projectors\nP\u22121 (~n), P0 (~n), P+1 (~n) and blue ones depict P\u22121 (~n0 ), P0 (~n0 ), P+1 (~n0 ). [Pm (~n), Pm0 (~n0 )] = 0 if and\nonly if the two vectors are parallel. Similar results hold for systems composed of a large number\nof spins of any dimension.\n\ntween the size of the system and the complexity of the measurements that can be performed\non it.\nAcknowledgments This work is supported by the National Research Foundation and Ministry of Education in Singapore.

Let us denote\nprojectors of the first measurement, that defines the Z axis, as Pm , where m labels eigenvalues\nof magnetization operator along Z. The projectors of the second measurement (along a\ndirection that defines the XZ plane) are denoted by P\u0303n and are related to Pn via rotation\noperator D(\u03b2), i.e., P\u0303n = D(\u03b2)Pn D\u2020 (\u03b2). Since we are dealing with N \u001d 1 particles, there\nare two different representations of Pm . The first one is given via the tensor product of spin\nstates corresponding to different particles\nX\n\nPm =\n\n(|k1 i \u2297 * * * \u2297 |kN i) (hk1 | \u2297 * * * \u2297 hkN |) ,\n\n(2)\n\nk1 +***+kN =m\n\nwhereas the second is given via a direct sum of spin states corresponding to different values\nof total angular momentum\nPm =\n\nX\n\n|j, \u03bbj , mihj, \u03bbj , m|,\n\n(3)\n\nj,\u03bbj\n\nwhere j runs over all values allowed by standard angular momenta addition rules and \u03bbj\ndenotes the degeneracy of j, i.e., the number of different realizations of spin j with N\nparticles. Note, that N \u001d 1 leads to a high degeneracy of Pm and as a result guarantees\nthat the sum in (3) runs over many different values of j. In this proof we exploit the\nproperties of the second representation.\nThe general form of the rotation matrix (often referred to as the Wigner d-matrix) is the\nfollowing\nX\n\nD(\u03b2) =\n\nj,\u03bb\n\nj\ndm\u0303,m\n(\u03b2)|j, \u03bbj , m\u0303ihj, \u03bbj , m|.\n\n(4)\n\nj,\u03bbj ,m,m\u0303\n\nIt follows that\nP\u0303n =\n\nj,\u03bb\n\nX\nj,\u03bbj\n\nj,\u03bb\n\nj\ndm\u0303,nj (\u03b2)dm\u03030 ,n\n(\u03b2)|j, \u03bbj , m\u0303ihj, \u03bbj , m\u03030 |,\n\n(5)\n\n,m\u0303,m\u03030\n\nand\n[Pm , P\u0303n ] =\n\nX\n\nj,\u03bb\n\nj\nj\ndj,\u03bb\nm,n (\u03b2)dm\u0303,n (\u03b2) (|j, \u03bbj , mihj, \u03bbj , m\u0303| \u2212 |j, \u03bbj , m\u0303ihj, \u03bbj , m|) .\n\nj,\u03bbj ,m\u0303\n\n7\n\n(6)\n\n\fThe above commutator equals zero if all terms of the corresponding matrix vanish. Let us\ndefine\nj,\u03bb\n\n\u0393k,kj0 = hj, \u03bbj , k|[Pm , P\u0303n ]|j, \u03bbj , k 0 i.\n\n(7)\n\nIn the above we do not consider off-diagonal terms corresponding to different j's and \u03bb's,\nsince they are trivially equal to zero. One easily finds\n\u0010\n\u0011\nj,\u03bb\nj,\u03bbj\nj,\u03bbj\nj\n0\n\u0393k,kj0 = dj,\u03bb\n(\u03b2)\n\u03b4\nd\n(\u03b2)\n\u2212\n\u03b4\nd\n(\u03b2)\n.\nk,m k0 ,n\nk ,m k,n\nm,n\n\n(8)\n\nj,\u03bb\n\nThe commutator vanishes if \u0393k,kj0 = 0 for all allowed j, \u03bbj , k, k 0 . Since there is no dependency on \u03bbj , from now on we skip this superscript. Below we show that there always exist a\nset of j, k, k 0 for which \u0393jk,k0 6= 0. First, let us note that \u0393jk,k0 can be nonzero only for k = m\nand k 0 6= m, or for k 6= m and k 0 = m. Effectively, without loosing generality, it is enough\nto show that there exist j and k 6= m for which\ndjm,n (\u03b2)djk,n (\u03b2) 6= 0.\nAt this stage let us write explicitly\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212m\u2212m0 \u0012\n\u00132j+m+m0\n(j + m0 )!(j \u2212 m0 )!\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n0\nj\ncos\n(\u22121)j+m \u00d7\nsin\ndm0 ,m (\u03b2) =\n(j + m)!(j \u2212 m)!\n2\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u00132\u03bd \u0012\n\u0013\u22122\u03bd\n\u0012\nX\nj+m\nj\u2212m\n\u03b2\n\uf8f8,\n\uf8ed(\u22121)\u03bd \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 cos \u03b2\nsin\n\u00d7\n0\n2\n2\n\u03bd\nj+m \u2212\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03bd goes over all integer values \u03bd \u2265 0 for which the binomial coefficients do not vanish.\nWe are going to find conditions under which djm0 ,m (\u03b2) is nonzero. Let us note that in\ncase of two nonparallel magnetization directions (0 < \u03b2 < \u03c0) all trigonometric functions in\nthe above formula are nonzero. Let us consider two cases. First, let us assume that both\nm0 = m = 0. In such a case\ndj0,0 (\u03b2) = Pj (cos \u03b2),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere Pj (x) is the Legendre polynomial that obeys\n\u221e\nX\n\nPj (x)tj = \u221a\n\nj=0\n\n1\n,\n1 \u2212 2xt + t2\n\n(12)\n\nand the recursion relation\n(j + 1)Pj+1 (x) = (2j + 1)xPj (x) \u2212 jPj\u22121 (x).\n8\n\n(13)\n\n\fWe claim that in the allowed range of j for any \u22121 < x < 1 there exists j for which\nPj (x) 6= 0. Otherwise, recursion relation would imply that Pj (x) 6= 0 for at most a finite set\nof j, but this is inconsistent with (12), hence it is not possible. Next, consider a case when\nat least one of labels (m or m0 ) differs from zero. In this case we set j = max{|m|, |m0 |} and\nit is easy to see that the sum in (10) has only one nonzero term.\nFinally, let us show that the product of two coefficients djm,n (\u03b2)djk,n (\u03b2) differs from zero.\nSince in this case j is the same for both coefficients and m and n are fixed, let us again\nconsider two cases. Following the above discussion, if both m = n = 0 we set j such that the\nfirst coefficient is nonzero and then we set k = j. On the other hand, if m or n are nonzero\nwe can guarantee that the first coefficient does not vanish by fixing j = max{|m|, |n|}. For\nthe second coefficient note that k 6= m. In case |m| \u2264 |n| it is possible to set k such that\n|k| \u2264 |n| and k 6= m. Since j = max{|m|, |n|} = |n| both coefficients are nonzero. In case\n|m| > |n| we set k = \u2212m and j = max{|m|, |n|} = |m| prevents both coefficients from being\nzero. This ends the proof.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: phykd@nus.edu.sg\n\n[1] J. S.
