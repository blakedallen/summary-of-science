THE TUNGUSKA SPACE BODY\nOn June 30th, 1908, a bollide triggered a massive explosion over Tunguska, in Central Siberia\n(Foschini, 2001). Over the last century several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the\nTunguska Phenomenon (Foschini 2001; Napier 2009; Vasilyev 1998); one of the frontrunners\nincludes the 1932 hypothesis of Vladimir Vernadskiy. Vernadskiy proposed that the Tunguska\nPhenomenon could have been due to the tangential passage of a body that grazed the Earths'\natmosphere, underwent a partial explosion and later entered a heliocentric orbit (Drobyshevski et\nal., 2009). A part of the Tunguska Space Body (TSB) exploded at an altitude of ~5\u00f710 km thereby\nreleasing energy equivalent to about 10 Mt of TNT, with the explosive power of hydrogen nuclear\nbombs, and leveling ~2,150 square kilometers of Siberian forest. Importantly, if the TSB explosion\nhad occurred 4h47' later then it would have proved catastrophic for the city of St.-Petersburg and\nwould have left over a million people dead (Lewis 1996).\n\nIt has suggested that comet Encke may have been responsible (Joseph 2009a). Comet Encke made\nextremely close approaches to Earth on June 16, 1908 and shed ice, rock and dust which streaked\nthrough the atmosphere of the Earth. According to Joseph, a large piece of Comet Encke may have\nbroken off, fell to Earth, and exploded above Tunguska thereby leveling forests for hundreds of\nmiles. Hence, comet Encke is yet another candidate for the TSB.\n\nTwo major mechanisms have been suggested to explain the breakup of the TSB. 1) It was an\n\"explosion in flight\" whereby air pressure caused the disintegration of the fast moving TSB\n(composed of rock and ice). 2) It was a \"chemical explosion\" whereby the cometary ices saturated\nwith the solid solution of 2H2+O2, the products of ice electrolysis, exploded (Drobyshevski et al.,\n2009).\n\n2\n\n\fStatistical analysis has shown a \u224883% probability that the TSB might be an asteroid and \u224817%\nprobability of a short period (SP) comet (Farinella et al., 2001). Most researchers have been\ninclined to believe that the TSB was an icy body rather than a rocky asteroid which exploded in\nflight (Napier 2009). This is because ice breaks up easier then rocks and leaves no rocky fragments,\nas observed on the site of the Tunguska Phenomenon (Drobyshevski et al., 2009).\n\n1.1. TSB and New Explosive Cosmogony (NEC) of Minor Bodies\nThe New Explosive Cosmogony (NEC) of minor bodies concept explains formation of SP\ncometary nuclei as due to extremely rare global explosions of thick (~800 km) electrolyzed icy\nenvelopes of distant moonlike bodies, similar to Ganymede or Titan. The NEC holds that the\nTunguska meteoroid belonged to these the SP cometary nuclei.\n\nIn the light of NEC, TSB has been deduced to be an icy cometary nucleus (whose ices contained\nproducts of its electrolysis, 2H2+O2) with a mass ~ 1013\u00f71014 g, ~ 200\u00f7500 m in diameter, and\nwhich was moving at a horizontal (\u03b4 = 0o) velocity ~ 20\u00f730 km/s. NEC also helps to explain the\npeculiar final turn in trajectory of the TSB (by \u0394\u03c6 ~ 10o to the west in the horizontal plane high in\nthe atmosphere: H \u2265 10 km, possibly, even H > 50 km (Drobyshevski 2009 and refs therein).\n\nThe NEC based approach offers a satisfactory explanation of the Tunguska Phenomenon. However\nsome minor aspects remain to be understood, like the mechanisms which produced nanodiamonds\n(Drobyshevski 2009).\n\n1.2. Return of the Tunguska Space Body\nThe Tunguska Space Body (TSB) lost up to 1012 g mass during the explosive interaction with the\nEarths' atmosphere and managed to escape into space, falling in an orbit around the Sun. So, if the\nTSB has not entered the gravitational sphere of other planets then it may well return for another\nclose encounter with Earth. Therefore it is reasonable to identify a possible candidate for the TSB\n(Drobyshevski et al., 2009; Foschini 2001; Lewis, 1996).\n\n3\n\n\fIn a bold and speculative effort, the search for the TSB began amongst the Potentially Hazardous\nAsteroids (PHAs) for bodies which might approach Earth to within \u0394 \u2264 0.05 AU in the time period\nfrom the present to the year 2178. This was based on back integration of orbits; a TSB candidate\nshould cross the Earth's orbit sometime around June 30, plus/minus a few days to account for the\nperturbations caused by other planets and probably non-gravitational forces.\n\nLater the search for the TSB was extended to Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Integration of the\nequations of motion (based on 19-order method of Everhart) of the 6077 known NEAs back to\nJanuary 1, 1908 was undertaken. The model included the effects of all large planets, Pluto and the\nMoon on the trajectory and orbit of this object. The coordinates of the perturbing bodies were\ncalculated on the basis of the DE405 ephemerises (Drobyshevski et al., 2009).\n\nOf the NEAs, 2005MB (\u0394 = 0.0971 AU, 26.06.1908) and 2005NB56 (\u0394 = 0.06945 AU,\n27.06.1908) while of the PHAs, 25143 Itokawa (\u0394 = 0.2728 AU, 30.06.1908) and 65909 1998\nFH12 (\u0394 = 0.1746AU, 30.06.1908) were found to be candidates for the TSB.\n\nBased on the data, the closest match for the TSB was NEA 2005NB56. This is because of 1) the\ncloseness of the date (June 27, 1908) to the time of the Tunguska Phenomenon 2) closest of the\nfour potential TSB candidates \u0394 = 0.06945 AU 3) orbital parameters being closest to those of\ncomet Encke and of the \u03b2-Taurid stream 4) of the four potential TSB candidates its size (\u2248170 m)\nclosely matches the lower estimate derived from the angle of turn of the TSB (Drobyshevski et al.,\n2009 and refs therein).\n\nNEA 2005NB56 might be the TSB. However it is not definite; for instance, it does not terminate at\nthe exact location of the TP event unless one takes into consideration the possible effects of\nnongravitational forces. Interestingly, NEA 2005NB56 is slated for additional rendezvous with\nEarth, the first of them on July 11, 2045, at a distance of 0.04249 AU (Drobyshevski et al., 2009).\n\n4\n\n\f2. TRANSFER OF MICROORGANISMS FROM EARTH TO OUTER SPACE\n\nThe Tunguska Space Body (TSB) is the only known body to have had an extremely close\ninteraction with Earth; just about ~5\u00f710 km above the Earth's surface, only to escape into space\n(Napier 2009). We are aware of the impact TSB left on Earth. However we are not aware of the\nimpact the interactions left on the TSB. It would be interesting to investigate if any of Earth's\natmospheric gasses or microorganisms became incorporated into the TSB when it bounced off the\nupper atmosphere.\n\nIt is known that microorganisms exist in significant concentrations in Earths' atmosphere (Burrows\net al., 2009; Griffin 2004; Wainwright et al., 2010). Microorganisms have been found in air\nsamples collected at heights ranging from 41 km (Wainwright et al., 2010) to 77 km (Imshenetsky\n1978). The natural mechanisms which transport microorganisms to the atmosphere are storm\nactivity, volcanic activity, monsoons, and impact events (Joseph and Schild 2010; Wainwright et\nal., 2010).\n\nIn fact, a particular long term study conducted close to the Tunguska Phenomenon site, in the skies\nof southwestern Siberia, found significant concentrations of culturable microorganisms over an\naltitude range of 0.5\u20137 km (Andreeva et al., 2002; Borodulin et al., 2005). This height range is\nsimilar to the height range of ~5\u00f710 km where the TSB interacted with Earth's atmosphere. Of\ncourse, the TSB-Earth interaction was fierce and explosive. However there is a possibility of\ncontamination, either of Earth's microorganisms into the TSB, or organisms which may have\nresided in the TSB being deposited on Earth, or both.\n\n5\n\n\f3. DISEASES FROM SPACE?\nHoyle, Wickramasinghe, Napier and others (Hoyle and Wickramasinghe 2000, Napier and\nWickramasinghe 2010; Wickramasinghe 2010; Wickramasinghe et al., 2009) have provided\nconsiderable evidence indicating microbial life can flourish within the heart of comets and may be\ndeposited on other planets including Earth. Wainwright et al., (2010), based on evidence of bacteria\nin the upper atmosphere and stratosphere, argue that life may be continually incoming from space\nand outgoing from Earth. Joseph (2009b; Joseph and Schild 2010) has developed a detailed model\nexplaining how microbes can be lofted into the stratosphere and periodically ejected into space\nduring particularly powerful solar storms. Joseph (2009b; Joseph and Schild 2010) has also\nprovided and reviewed evidence that microbes can travel from planet to planet and solar system to\nsolar system encased in asteroids, comets and other stellar debris, and that they can survive the\nimpact and heat of ejection and reentry into the atmosphere. Therefore, there is good reason to\nsuspect that a stellar object striking and skimming along the upper atmosphere could eject microbes\ninto the atmosphere of Earth and become contaminated with microbes already present at these\nheights.\n\nJoseph (2000, 2009c; Joseph and Schild 2010) has developed a detailed genetic model of cosmic\nevolution, and has argued that as microbes and viruses are transferred from planet to planet, they\nexchange and acquire DNA. According to Joseph (2000, 2009c) these genes were then transferred\nto the eukaryotic genome, contributing to the evolution of multi-cellular life leading to humans.\nLikewise, Wainwright et al., (2010) propose that incoming and outgoing microbes may exchange\nDNA via horizontal gene transfer, and this genetic exchange contributes to the evolution of life on\nEarth.\n\nWickramasinghe (2010) also believes that space-traveling microbes and viruses contribute to\nevolution, but are also responsible for \"errors\" introduced into the genome. These \"errors\" result in\ndisease, disability, and death. Hoyle and Wickramasinghe (1979, 1986) have referred to this as\n\"diseases from space.\"\n\n6\n\n\fIs there any evidence that microbes and viruses were deposited on Earth by the TSB or following\nthe Tunguska impact in 1908? The evidence is indirect at best, i.e. the 1918 flu epidemic which\nkilled over 20 million people world wide (Joseph 2009a). It is unknown if the TSB is comet Encke.\nHowever, Comet Encke made extremely close approaches to Earth on June 16, 1908, and again on\nOctober 27 1914, and was at perihelion on 1918. And with each approach, Comet Encke shed ice,\nrock and dust which streaked through the atmosphere of Earth.\n\nAccording to Hoyle and Wickramasinghe (1979, 1986, 2000; Wickramasinghe 2010;\nWickramasinghe et al., 2009) under these circumstances microbes and viruses would be shed from\nthe comet and would be deposited on Earth and could induce disease. Wainwright et al., (2010)\nargue that microbes from space would exchange DNA with microbes of Earth, and the same has\nbeen said of viruses (Joseph and Schild 2010). There is also considerable evidence that the 1918 flu\nepidemic was due to gene mixing between an already established virus and a completely unknown\n\"new\" virus (Joseph 2009a).\n\nAs detailed by Joseph (2009a):\n\n\"In 2005, scientists from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, D.C.,\nresurrected the 1918 virus from bodies that had been preserved in the permanently frozen\nsoil of Alaska. They soon discovered that a completely new virus had combined with an\nold virus, exchanging and recombining genes, creating a hybrid that transformed mild\nstrains of the flu virus into forms far more deadly and pathogenic. They also confirmed that\nthe 1918 Spanish flu virus originated in the sky, first infecting birds and then spreading and\nproliferating in humans.\"\n\n7\n\n\f4. VERNADSKIY MISSION\nNEA 2005NB56 has been identified as a close match to the TSB. It will make its next close\napproach to Earth in 2045. This provides us a unique opportunity to send a mission to NEA\n2005NB56. This proposed mission, tentatively called as Vernadskiy Mission, should have a design\nsimilar to the Stardust mission which captured material from comet 81P/Wild 2 in 2004, which was\nsubsequently analyzed (Brownlee et al., 2006).\n\nAnalysis of material from NEA 2005NB56 will possibly help us to establish if NEA 2005NB56 is\nindeed the TSB and if it played any role in \"diseases from space.\" The scientific community will\nhave to identify and search for some tell-tale components of Earth's atmospheric components and\nalso for microorganisms and viruses, viable or otherwise.\n\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nVernadskiy Mission will help us analyze the material from NEA 2005NB56. If we are able to\nestablish that NEA 2005NB56 is indeed the TSB then one of the greatest mysteries of our times\nwill be solved. The bonus might be that we may find microorganisms. This would for the first time\nestablish beyond doubt the transfer of life via mechanisms of panspermia and may shed light on the\npossibility that diseases may originate in space.\n\n8\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author is grateful to his friend, Kapil Mayekar, for his cushioning support.\n\nREFERENCES\nAndreeva, I., and 25 colleagues.
