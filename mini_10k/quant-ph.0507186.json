In the\nultracold regime, atomic collisions are dominated by swave scattering, and interactions can be accurately modeled by the Fermi-Huang pseudopotential [1, 2]. The\nsituation changes, however, in the presence of scattering resonances, which can strongly enhance the contribution from higher partial waves. Such possibility has\nbeen demonstrated in recent experiments by employing\nFeshbach resonances to tune the interactions of identical\nfermions in p-wave [3, 4]. In this context, the development of pseudopotentials for higher partial wave scattering is of crucial importance for the theoretical description\nof ultracold gases with l 6= 0 interactions.\nThere are several approaches in the literature to derive pseudopotential valid for all partial waves. The first\nderivation comes from Huang and Yang [2]. Their pseudopotential, however, is incorrect with respect to l > 0\nwaves, as recently shown in [5]. Several alternatives have\nbeen proposed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], which have specific limitations. For instance, [5] entails no regularization and is\nonly applicable to mean-field theories; [6] requires knowledge of the wave function in the inner region of the shell\npotential, and taking the limit of shell radius going to\nzero in the final step of the calculation.\nIn this Letter we address the problem of interactions\nin all partial waves. We correct the original derivation\nof Huang and Yang and obtain a comparatively simple\npseudopotential. Next, we derive explicit pseudopotential forms for p- and d-wave interactions, that are are\nvery convenient in calculations involving anisotropic external potentials. We illustrate this by solving analytically the problem of two identical fermions confined in\nan anisotropic harmonic trap. We finally turn to interactions of atoms in low dimensional systems. We apply our\np-wave pseudopotential to analyze the p-wave scattering\nin quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) system, and show the\noccurrence of confinement-induced resonances analogous\nto s-wave scattering [10, 11], and p-wave scattering in\nQ1D [12]. Our analysis is of direct interest for studies of\ncontrolled interactions between tightly confined fermionic\natoms, relevant for applications to quantum information\nprocessing.\n\nFirst, we derive the pseudopotential for interactions in\nall partial waves. We start from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor the relative motion\n~2\n(\u2206 + k 2 )\u03a8(r) = V (r)\u03a8(r),\n2\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k 2 = 2\u03bcE/~2 , and \u03bc denotes the reduced mass.\nWe assume that the potential V (r) is central and has a\nfinite range. Outside the range of the potential, the wave\nfunction exhibits the following asymptotic behavior\n\n\u03a8a (r) =\n\n\u221e X\nl\nX\n\nRl (r)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(2)\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nwhere Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) are spherical harmonics, the radial wave\nfunctions Rl = Clm [jl (kr) \u2212 tan \u03b4l nl (kr)] are linear combinations of spherical Bessel and Neumann functions\njl (r) and nl (r), Clm are coefficients that depend on the\nboundary condition for r \u2192 \u221e, and the phase shifts\n\u03b4l are determined by the potential V (r). Our goal is\nto replace V (r) by contact potential Vps (r), which acts\nonly at r = 0 and gives the same asymptotic function \u03a8a (r) as the real potential V (r). Following Huang\nand Yang [2], we determine the pseudopotential from\nVps (r)\u03a8a (r) = ~2 /(2\u03bc)(\u2206 + k 2 )\u03a8a (r). Since jl (kr) is\nregular at r = 0, the only contribution to the pseudopotential comes from the behavior of nl (kr) for small r:\nnl (x) \u223c \u2212(2l \u2212 1)!!/xl+1 . Hence\nVps (r)\u03a8a (r) =\n\n\u221e\nl\n~2 X X\n(2l \u2212 1)!!Clm tan \u03b4l Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n2\u03bc\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nd\n2 d\n1\nl(l + 1)\n\u00d7\n+\n. (3)\n\u2212\n2\n2\ndr\nr dr\nr\n(kr)l+1\n\nTo calculate the action of the radial part of the Laplace\noperator on the function 1/rl+1 at r = 0, one has to resort to the theory of generalized functions. By applying\nthe Hadamard finite part regularization of the singular\nfunction 1/rk [13, 14], one can prove the following iden-\n\n\f2\ntity\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\n(\u22121)l+1 (2l + 1) \u03b4 (l) (r)\n2 d\nl(l + 1) 1\nd\n=\n,\n+\n\u2212\ndr\nr dr\nr2\nrl+1\nl!\nr2\n(4)\nwhere \u03b4 (n) (r) denotes the n-th derivative of the delta\nfunction. In comparison, Huang and Yang calculate (4)\nby mapping on \u03b4(r)/rl , which leads them to the incorrect result. In the final step of the derivation we\nexpress the coefficients Clm in terms of the regularization operator \u2202r2l+1 rl+1 : Clm = (2l + 1)!!/[k l (2l +\n1)!][\u2202r2l+1 rl+1 Rl (r)]r=0 . In this way we obtain the following form of the pseudopotential:\n\u221e\n\nVps (r)\u03a8(r) =\n\n~2 X (\u22121)l+1 [(2l + 1)!!]2 tan \u03b4l \u03b4 (l) (r)\n2\u03bc\n4\u03c0(2l)! l!\nk 2l+1 r2\nl=0\n\u0015\n\u0014 2l+1\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2032 l+1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nr\nd\u03a9\nP\n(n*n\n)\u03a8(r\n)\n,\n\u00d7\nl\n\u2202r\u2032 2l+1\nr\u2032 =0\n(5)\n\u2032\n\nwhere the angular integral over \u03a9 acts as a projection\noperator on a state with a given quantum number l.\nHere, Pl (x) is the Legendre polynomial, n = r/r, and\nn\u2032 = r\u2032 /r\u2032 . We note that in the calculation of the matrix\nelements of Vps (r) the differentiation of the delta function is equivalent to differentiation of the function that\nacts on the l.h.s. of the pseudopotential, with a proper\nchange of sign. Moreover, for functions behaving like\nrl for small r, one can substitute \u03b4 (l) (r) = (\u22121)l l!\u03b4(r)/rl\nand \u03b4(r) = 4\u03c0r2 \u03b4(r) which shows that the s-wave component of (5) is equivalent to Fermi-Huang pseudopotential:\n\u22122\u03c0~2 tan \u03b40 /(\u03bck)\u03b4(r), whereas components with l > 0\ndiffer from the pseudopotential of Huang and Yang [2] by\na prefactor.\nNow we derive an alternative form of the pseudopotential, with projection operators expressed in terms of\nthe differential operators. Such representation is particularly useful for problems involving anisotropic external\npotentials, since in this case the wave function, containing several components of the angular momentum, has\nto be projected on a given partial wave interaction. Let\nus first focus on p-wave interactions. Expressing radial\nderivatives in terms of the gradient operator \u2202r = n*\u2207,\nwhere \u2207 = (\u2202x , \u2202y , \u2202z ), and performing the angular integration in the projection operator, we obtain the following form of the pseudopotential for p-wave interactions\n\nVp (r) =\n\n\u2192\n\u03c0~2 ap (k)3 \u2190\n\u22023 2\n\u2207 \u03b4(r) \u2207 r 3 r ,\n\u03bc\n\u2202r\n\n(6)\n\nwhere ap is the p-wave scattering length: ap (k)3 =\n\u2190\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2212 tan \u03b41 (k)/k 3 , and the symbol \u2207 (\u2207) denotes the gradient operator that acts to the left (right) of the pseudopotential. To derive (6), in the operator acting to the\nr.h.s. of the pseudopotential, we introduced an additional multiplication by r: \u2202r3 r2 \u2192 \u2202r r\u2202r3 r2 = n*\u2207r\u2202r3 r2 ,\n\nwhich is equivalent for terms of the order of r, giving\nthe contribution to the matrix elements. In this way we\npreserve the form of the regularization operator, which is\ncrucial for an exact treatment of the interacting atoms.\nWe note that the pseudopotential for p-wave interactions\nin the form containing a scalar product of gradients has\nbeen derived for the first time by Omont [7], however,\nin [7] it contained an incorrect prefactor, and did not\ninclude the regularization operator. We stress that the\npresence of the full regularization operator \u2202r3 r2 on the\nr.h.s. of the pseudopotential (6) is important, since for\nanisotropic external potentials the exact wave functions\nobtained in the pseudopotential method contains terms\nbehaving like xi /r for small r. Such terms, for instance,\nare not removed by the operator \u2207\u2202r2 r2 [8].\nA similar procedure can be repeated for d-wave interactions. In this case we obtain the following pseudopotential\n\u0011\u2192 \u2202 5\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n\u2190\u0010\nVd (r) = gd\nDijkl \u2202x2i xj \u03b4(r) \u2202x2k xl r2 5 r3 , (7)\n\u2202r\ni,j,k,l\n\nwhere Dijkl = \u03b4ik \u03b4jl \u2212 31 \u03b4ij \u03b4kl , gd = \u03c0~2 ad (k)5 /(8\u03bc)\nand ad (k) is the d-wave scattering length: ad (k)5 =\n\u2212 tan \u03b42 (k)/k 5 . As can be easily verified, the pseudopotential (7) does not give any contribution for functions\nexhibiting s- and p-wave symmetries, which results from\nthe implicit projection on d-wave contained in (7).\nTwo interacting spin-polarized fermions in a harmonic\ntrap.- We start from the integral form of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for the relative motion of atoms\nZ\n\u03a8(r) = d3 r\u2032 G(r, r\u2032 )Vp (r\u2032 )\u03a8(r\u2032 ),\n(8)\nwhere G(r, r\u2032 ) = hr|(E \u2212 \u0124)\u22121 |r\u2032 i is the single-particle\nGreen function, and \u0124 is the Hamiltonian including the\nexternal potential.

As it can be\neasily verified, for the case of spherically symmetric trap\n(\u03b7 = 1), Eqs. (10)-(11) coincide with the result of Refs.\n[6, 8]. We note that in the presence of an anisotropic the\ndegeneracy between states with m = 0 and m = \u00b11 is\nlifted. We have derived similar closed analytic formulas\nfor cigar-shape traps with \u03b7 = n [15], however, we do\nnot present them in the present letter because of their\nrather complicated form. In general, when \u03b7 6= 1/n and\n\u03b7 6= n, the energy levels can be determined from an implicit equation involving the integral representation (9)\n[21].\nFigs. 1(a) and 1(b) show the energy levels in harmonic traps with \u03b7 = 1/10 and \u03b7 = 10, for different\nvalues of the quantum number m. We observe that for\nsmall and positive values of the scattering volume, the\nsystem does not have eigenstates with energies smaller\nthan the lowest eigenenergy for noninteracting atoms,\nThis particular behavior results from the properties of\nthe p-wave pseudopotential. In this regime of energies,\nhowever, it is necessary to include in the calculation the\nenergy-dependence of the pseudopotential. To this end\nit is sufficient to insert in the pseudopotential (6) the energy dependence of the phase-shift \u03b41 (k), and calculate\nthe energy spectrum in a self-consistent way. This extends the applicability of the pseudopotential method to\nthe large scattering lengths and tight confining potentials\nand allows to describe the entire molecular spectrum of\nthe realistic potential [6, 17].\nTo illustrate this procedure we calculate the energy\nspectrum for a square-well model interaction, assuming for simplicity spherically symmetric harmonic trap.\nFig. 1(c) presents the energy levels of p-wave interacting particles as a function of the square-well depth U\ncalculated for the square-well radius R0 = 0.05d. The\ndepth U is varied close to the resonance scattering for\np-wave, related to the appearance of a bound state\nat U = \u22121974~\u03c9. The exact energy levels are compared with predictions of the pseudopotential method\ngiven by Eq. (10), and with the energy spectrum calculated in a self-consistent way from Eq. (10) with a3p\nreplaced by ap (k)3 = \u2212 tan \u03b41 (k)/k 3 . For comparison,\nFig. 1(d) shows the energy levels of s-wave interacting\natoms, given in the pseudopotential approximation by\nd/as = 2\u0393( 43 \u2212 E2 )/\u0393( 41 \u2212 E2 ) [18], where E = E/(~\u03c9) and\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n20\n\nm = 0\n\n(b)\n\n= 10\n\n-0.5\n\nm = +1,-1\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n(a /d )\n\nz\n\np\n\n10\n\nE/\n\nn\u22121\nk+1/2\nd3z\n8 X \u0393( n \u2212\n=\n\u2212\nk+1/2\na3p\nn\n\u2212\nk=0 \u0393( n\n\n2\n\nE/\n\nA(E)\u2212 I.

The atoms are confined in an isotropic harmonic\npotential and interact in p-wave (c) and s-wave (d).\n\nas is the s-wave scattering length.\nOne observes that self-consistent calculation with\nenergy-dependent pseudopotential (EDP) provides very\naccurate results for the energy spectrum. On the other\nhand, the ordinary pseudopotential method fails for large\nscattering volumes, and for energies where the bound\nstate of the square well potential appears. Moreover, its\nrange of applicability decreases for higher energy levels.\nFor comparison, the ordinary s-wave pseudopotential is\nincorrect only with respect to deep bound-states.\nThis behavior can be explained by analyzing the effective range expansion: k 3 cot \u03b41 (k) = \u22121/a3p \u2212 k 2 /(2R\u2217 ) +\nO(k 4 ), where R\u2217 can be interpreted as effective range for\np-wave (for square-well R\u2217 = R0 /3). The second term in\nthe expansion can be neglected when k|ap | \u226a (kR\u2217 )1/3 ,\nwhich combined with the condition for the applicability of the pseudopotential: kR\u2217 \u226a 1, gives k|ap | \u226a 1.\nTherefore, the regime where one can apply the ordinary,\nenergy-independent pseudopotential for p-waves is quite\nnarrow. This can be compared to the s-wave, where the\nanalogous condition takes form k|a| \u226a (k R\u0303)\u22121 , where R\u0303\nis the effective range for s-wave scattering and (k R\u0303)\u22121 is\nlarge.\nScattering of spin-polarized fermions in Q2D\nsystems.- The scattering solution can be found\nfrom the Lippmann-Schwinger equation:\nZ\n\u03a8(r) = \u03a80 (r) + d3 r\u2032 G+ (r, r\u2032 )Vp (r\u2032 )\u03a8(r\u2032 ),\n(12)\nwhere \u03a80 (r) represent the wave function of the incoming\n\n\f4\nE = 0.501\n\n100\n\nz\n\nz\n\n3\n\n15\n\n10\n\nV\n\n2\n\n| f (0)| /d\n\nz\n\nC\n\n/d\n\nE = 0.508\nE = 0.516\n\n-100\n\nE = 0.525\n\n0.50\n\n0.52\nE/\n\n5\n\n0\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0.54\n\nz\n\n20\n\n\u0014\u221a 3\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n1\nE\n\u03c0dz\n,\n\u2212\nW\n\u2212\na3p\n2\n4\n\n(14)\n\nz\n\nz\n\n0\n\n2\n3\u03c0k 2 d2z\n\nz\n\n0.56\n\n40\n\n3\n\n(a /d )\np\n\ncot \u03b41 = \u2212\n\nz\n\nFIG. 2: Two-dimensional differential cross section in forward\ndirection |f (0)|2 in the scattering of two fermions in a quasi2D system as a function of p-wave scattering volume a3p , for\ndifferent relative energies E of the particles.

When cot \u03b41 = 0, the system\nexhibits confinement-induced resonance,\nwhich occurs at\n\u221a\nthe scattering volume Vc (E) = \u03c0d3z /W(E/2 \u2212 1/4). At\nlow energies (E \u2192 21 ) function W(x) has a well defined\nlimit: W(0) \u2248 0.325, and Vc (0) \u2248 5.4d3z . This qualitatively differs from s-wave interactions, where cot \u03b40\nexhibits logarithmic behavior for small k [11] and the\nresonance condition for k \u2192 0 depends on the relative\nkinetic energy of the scattered particles. Fig. 2 shows\nthe dependence of the differential cross section |f (\u03c6)|2 at\n\u03c6 = 0 on the scattering volume a3p for different values\nof the energy. We observe that at low energies of the\nscattered particles the curve is strongly peaked around\nVc . For higher energies the resonance is broader and finally for E \u2248 0.525 disappears. In this regime of energies\nthe resonance is present for positive values of the scattering volume, which can be observed in the inset of Fig. 2\npresenting Vc (E).\nIn summary, we presented the zero-range pseudopotential applicable for all partial wave interactions. For pand d-waves we derived an alternative representation of\nthe pseudopotential, in which the projection on spherical harmonics is replaced by an appropriate differential\noperator. The p-wave pseudopotential has been applied\nto calculate analytically the spectrum of two interacting\nfermions in a harmonic trap, and to study the scattering\nof identical fermions in a quasi-two-dimensional system.\nAfter completing this paper we learned of recent work\nof Derevianko [20] in which the pseudopotential equivalent to (5) is derived.\nWe thank L.P.
