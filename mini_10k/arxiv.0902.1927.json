This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated [2] and\nsubsequently observed [3]. Recently, jet quenching [4]\nhas been discovered in heavy-ion collisions at Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider\n(RHIC). In this context, very exciting jet-associated particle correlations [5] have been observed, which indicates\nthe formation of shock waves in form of Mach cones [6] induced by supersonic partons moving through the quarkgluon plasma (QGP). If true, it could give a direct access\nto the equation of state of the QGP, because the Mach\ncone angle is given by \u03b1 = arccos(cs /vjet ), where cs is\nthe velocity of sound of the QGP. The velocity of sound\nis related to the equation of state via c2s = dP/de, where\nP is the pressure and e the energy density.\nShock waves can form and propagate only if matter behaves like a fluid. The large measured elliptic flow coefficient v2 [7] indicates that the QGP created at the RHIC\ncould even be a nearly perfect fluid. This is confirmed\nby recent calculations within viscous hydrodynamics [8]\nand microscopic transport theory [9] which estimate the\nshear viscosity to entropy density ratio \u03b7/s to be less\nthan 0.4 in order to not spoil the agreement with the v2\ndata. However, it is an important question whether the\n\u03b7/s value deduced from v2 data is sufficiently small to\nallow for the formation of shock waves.\nIn this Letter we make an effort to answer this question by considering the relativistic Riemann problem in\nviscous gluon matter. Using the BAMPS microscopic\ntransport model (BAMPS denotes the Boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings) [10] we demonstrate\nthe transition from ideal shock waves with zero width, to\nviscous shock waves with nonzero width, to free diffusion\nby varying the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio\n\u03b7/s from zero to infinity. We estimate the upper limit\nof the \u03b7/s ratio, for which shocks can still be observed\nexperimentally on the time scale of an ultrarelativistic\nheavy-ion collision.\nThe initial condition for the relativistic Riemann problem consists of two regions of thermodynamically equili-\n\n0.70\n0.60\n0.50\n\nt = 3.2 fm/c\n\n0.40\n0.20\n0.15\nv\n\narXiv:0902.1927v2 [hep-ph] 22 Jul 2009\n\nWe solve the relativistic Riemann problem in viscous gluon matter employing a microscopic parton\ncascade.

The upper panel shows the\npressure and the lower panel the velocity at time t = 3.2 fm/c.\n\n(x, y) direction so that the further evolution of matter\nbecomes (1 + 1)-dimensional. For a perfect fluid, i.e.,\n\u03b7 = 0, this problem has an analytical solution [11], given\nby the solid curves in Fig. 1. For a thermodynamically\nnormal medium, there is a shock wave travelling into\nmatter with the lower pressure (on the right) with velocity vshock larger than the velocity of sound cs . The\n\n\f2\nregion of constant pressure behind the shock wave is the\nso-called shock plateau. Here, matter moves collectively\nwith a constant velocity vplat as shown in the bottom\npanel of Fig. 1. Simultaneously with the creation of the\nshock wave, a rarefaction wave travels with velocity cs\ninto matter with the larger pressure (on the left). For\nan ideal fluid, the solution of the Riemann problem is\nself-similar in the variable \u03b6 = z/t, i.e., the solution as a\nfunction of \u03b6 does not change with time.\nThe velocity of the shock front is determined from the\nrelativistic Rankine-Hugoniot-Taub equations [12] and is\ngiven by [11]\nvshock\n\n\u0014\n\n(P3 \u2212 P4 )(e3 + P4 )\n=\n(e4 + P3 )(e3 \u2212 e4 )\n\n\u00151/2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P3 and e3 (P4 and e4 ) are the pressure and energy\ndensity on the left (right) side of the shock front. For noninteracting ultrarelativistic gluon matter the equation of\nstate is e = 3P . For the situation depicted in Fig. 1,\nvshock = 0.645.\nThe extreme opposite of an ideal fluid (i.e., \u03b7 =\n0) is a gas of free-streaming particles (i.e., \u03b7 = \u221e).\nThe solution of the Riemann problem for free-streaming\nparticles is given by the short-dashed lines in Fig. 1,\nwhich can also be calculated analytically [13]. From\nthe solution for the single-particle distribution function f (x, p), Rone computes the energy-momentum tensor T \u03bc\u03bd = (d3 p/E) p\u03bc p\u03bd f (x, p), where p\u03bc = (E, p)\nis the four-momentum. The energy density defined as\ne = u\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd u\u03bd is the largest eigenvalue of T\u03bd\u03bc . The eigenvector u\u03bc is then the four velocity in Landau's definition [14]. In our case u\u03bc = \u03b3(1, 0, 0, v), where v =\nT 03 /(e + T 33 ) and \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 v 2 )\u22121/2 . The pressure is defined as P = \u2212\u2206\u03bc\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd /3, where \u2206\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 u\u03bc u\u03bd and\ng \u03bc\u03bd = (1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) is the metric tensor. For systems\nof massless particles T\u03bd\u03bc is traceless and thus P = e/3. In\nthe free-streaming case the characteristic structure of the\nsolution of the Riemann problem for an ideal fluid is completely washed out, and a clear distinction between the\nshock wave and the rarefaction fan is no longer possible.\nIn the following, we study the influence of the \u03b7/s ratio\non the formation and evolution of shock waves by solving\nthe Riemann problem with the parton cascade BAMPS\n[10]. BAMPS is a microscopic transport model which\nsolves the Boltzmann equation p\u03bc \u2202\u03bc f (x, p) = C(x, p) for\non-shell gluons with the collision integral C(x, p). In this\nstudy, we consider only binary gluon scattering processes\nwith an isotropic cross section. We remark that, although\nperturbative QCD (pQCD) favors small angles in binary\ngluon scatterings, the use of an isotropic cross section effectively implements pQCD gluon bremsstrahlung, which\nhas a broader angular distribution due to the suppression\nof soft collinear radiation [10].\nIn our calculations we use a constant \u03b7/s value. In\norder to achieve this, we have to locally adjust the cross\n\nsection \u03c3, since the particle density n is not constant.\nThe shear viscosity \u03b7 is given by \u03b7 = 4e/(15Rtr) [15],\nwhere the transport collision rate Rtr = n\u03c3 tr = 2n\u03c3/3\nfor isotropic scattering processes\n[16]. n is calculated via\nR\nn = N \u03bc u\u03bc , where N \u03bc = (d3 p/E)p\u03bc f (x, p). We obtain\n\u03b7=\n\n2\ne\u03bbmfp ,\n5\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bbmfp = 1/(n\u03c3) is the gluon mean-free path. Binary\ncollisions imply that we cannot maintain chemical equilibrium. In this case, in kinetic equilibrium the entropy\ndensity is calculated approximately via s = 4n \u2212 n ln \u03bb,\nwhere \u03bb = n/neq is the gluon fugacity measuring the\ndeviation from chemical equilibrium. For a nonvanishing shear viscosity, the system will deviate from initial\nkinetic and chemical equilibrium during the evolution\n[17]. Gluons are regarded as Boltzmann particles, so that\nthe number density in thermal equilibrium is given by\nneq = dG T 3 /\u03c0 2 with dG = 16 for gluons and T = e/(3n)\ndenotes the temperature. Sending \u03b7/s to zero the cross\nsection will be unphysically large. However, it serves as\na useful test of the parton cascade in the ideal hydrodynamical limit.\nIn Fig. 1, we show the results for various \u03b7/s values\nas computed with BAMPS, demonstrating the gradual\ntransition from the ideal hydrodynamical limit to free\nstreaming of particles. Remarkably, the ideal solution is\nreproduced to very high precision by the BAMPS calculation for a small \u03b7/s = 0.001. In this sense, BAMPS\ncan compare with state-of-the-art numerical algorithms\nused to solve the ideal hydrodynamical equations [11]. A\nlarger \u03b7/s value results in a finite transition layer where\nthe quantities change smoothly rather than discontinuously as in the case of a perfect fluid. The width of the\nshock front is proportional to the shear viscosity [18].\nAs seen in Fig. 1, a nonzero viscosity smears the pressure and velocity profiles and impedes a clean separation\nof the shock front from the rarefaction fan. A criterion\nfor a clear separation, and thus the observability of a\nshock wave, is the formation of a shock plateau, as in\nthe ideal-fluid case. The formation of a shock plateau\ntakes a certain amount of time, as demonstrated in Fig.\n2 where we show the pressure and velocity profiles at\ndifferent times for \u03b7/s = 0.1. Formally, we define the\ntime of formation of the shock plateau when the maximum of the velocity distribution v(z) reaches the value\nvplat of the ideal-fluid solution. From the bottom part of\nFig. 2, we see that this happens at t = 3.2 fm/c. This\nagrees with what we obtained in the bottom part of Fig.\n1. From this figure we also infer that, for \u03b7/s > 0.1,\na shock plateau has not yet developed at t = 3.2 fm/c,\nwhereas for \u03b7/s < 0.1, it has already fully formed.\nIn order to understand the timescale of formation of a\nshock wave, we define the quantity [16, 17, 19]\nK=\n\n\u03bbmfp\n,\nL\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\n\ninitial condition\nt = 0.64 fm/c\nt = 3.20 fm/c\nt = 6.40 fm/c\n\n1.00\n0.90\n\n10\n8\ntf (fm/c)\n\nwhere L \u2261 t (vshock + cs ) is the width of the region\nbounded by the rarefaction wave travelling to the left\nand the shock front moving to the right (in the ideal-fluid\ncase). Note that \u03bbmfp is not constant; we approximate\nit by its maximum value which is assumed on the lowpressure side (the undisturbed medium) in front of the\nshock wave. The quantity K can be viewed as a \"global\"\nKnudsen number for the Riemann problem. K goes to\nzero at late times, which implies that the medium behaves more and more like an ideal system.\nWe find a scaling behavior for the solution of the Rie-\n\n6\n4\n\nP4/P0 : 0.02\n0.06\n\n2\n\n0.15\n0.41\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\u03b7/s\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Formation time of shock waves as a\nfunction of \u03b7/s.\n\nP/P0\n\n0.80\n\nuntil 6\u22127.2 fm/c, which most likely exceeds the lifetime\nof the QGP at the RHIC. Vice versa, if shock phenomena\nare discovered at RHIC, this could be an indication that\nthe QGP has a small \u03b7/s ratio, probably smaller than\n0.2. For a more viscous QGP no shock waves and thus\nno Mach cones will be formed. In a relativistic heavy-ion\ncollision, the temperature is decreasing during the expansion. Thus, according to Eq. (4), tf is even larger and\nshock waves may be even harder to observe.\nTo confirm our results calculated with BAMPS, we\nsolve the Riemann problem within relativistic dissipative\nfluid dynamics. To this end, we use the Israel-Stewart\n(IS) equations [20] (see Ref. [21] for different approaches).\nWe neglect heat conductivity and bulk viscosity (thus assuming local chemical equilibrium).

The value of K at which the shock wave\nforms, called Kf , is universal for a given P4 /P0 . With\nEq. (2) we obtain \u03bbmfp = 10/(3T4)\u03b7/s in the undisturbed\nmedium with the lower pressure.

The laboratory frame\nenergy and momentum density are given by T 00 = (e +\nP + \u03c0\u0303)\u03b3 2 \u2212 (P + \u03c0\u0303), and T 0z = (e + P + \u03c0\u0303)\u03b3 2 v, while the\nsystem is closed by a massless gluon equation of state.\nFor vanishing shear viscous pressure, \u03c0\u0303, Eqs. (5) and (6)\nreduce to the equations of ideal hydrodynamics.\nThe first-order theory of relativistic dissipative fluid\ndynamics defines the viscous pressure algebraically by the\nrelativistic Navier-Stokes value \u03c0N S = \u2212(4/3)\u03b7\u03b8 [14, 22].\nIn the IS equations, the local shear pressure relaxes to\nthe Navier-Stokes value on a timescale comparable to the\nmean-free time between collisions, given by the relaxation\ntime \u03c4\u03c0 = 2\u03b7\u03b22 , where \u03b22 = 3/(4P ) [20].\nThe IS equations (5)-(7) are solved numerically using the viscous sharp and smooth transport algorithm\n(vSHASTA) approach [23]. Figure 4 shows comparisons\nbetween the results from BAMPS and vSHASTA calculations for \u03b7/s = 0.01 and 0.2.

Results obtained from\nvSHASTA and BAMPS calculations are compared.\n\nfor \u03b7/s = 0.01, whereas for the larger value \u03b7/s = 0.2\nsmall deviations in the region around the shock front\nand the rarefaction fan are found. The reason can be understood considering the Knudsen number K\u03b8 \u2261 \u03bbmfp \u03b8.\nThe IS equations contain terms of second order in K\u03b8\n[24]. However, at the shock front, the macroscopic scale\nover which the fluid velocity varies is comparable to the\nmicroscopic scale \u03bbmfp , such that K\u03b8 \u223c 1, and one would\nneed higher powers of K\u03b8 in the IS equations to improve\nthe description. Wherever K\u03b8 is large, the applicability\nof the IS theory is questionable. Microscopic transport\ncalculations do not suffer from this drawback.\nIn summary, employing the parton cascade BAMPS\nwe have solved the relativistic Riemann problem. The\ntransition from ideal-fluid behavior to free streaming is\ndemonstrated. Numerical results from BAMPS agree\nwell with those obtained from viscous hydrodynamical\ncalculations. We found that the formation of shock waves\nin gluon matter with \u03b7/s > 0.2 probably takes longer\nthan the lifetime of the QGP at the RHIC. Whether\nMach cones from jets [25] can be observed within nuclear collisions will be studied in the future within the\nBAMPS approach.\nThe authors are grateful to B. Betz, L.P. Csernai,\nJ.A.
