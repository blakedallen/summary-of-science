The method orre tly lo ates the phase transitions between gapped and non-gapped\nphases.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\ndilemma in the resear h of a ura y\n\nThe idea that one may see a periodi latti e as built\nfrom intera ting blo ks of sites, rather than as intera ting\nsites, is omputationally and intelle tually attra tive and\nhas re eived several exploitations. This pro ess onsists\nin a s ale hange. Wilson's bright proposal of real spa e\nrenormalization group (RSRG) is ertainly the most elegant illustration of this idea, sin e it an be in\u001cnitely iterated and asymptoti ally onverges on physi ally meaningful a umulation points. The method in its original\nversion onsists in a simple and severe trun ation of the\nHilbert spa e by onsidering only the lowest states of ea h\nblo k and the produ ts of the sele ted blo k eigenfun tions to approa h the eigenfun tions of blo ks of blo ks.\nThe method happened to be numeri ally ine\u001e ient. Reent works have shown that its performan es an be dramati ally improved when one de\u001cnes e\u001be tive intera tions between the blo ks. These e\u001be tive intera tions are\nal ulated from the knowledge of the exa t spe trum of\nthe dimers (or trimers) of blo ks using Blo h's theory\nof e\u001be tive Hamiltonian. The so- alled ontra tor renormalization (CORE) te hnique\nonsiders blo ks, retains a few eigenstates |IA i of ea h blo k A and de\u001cnes\ninter-blo k e\u001be tive intera tions hIA JB |H ef f |KA LB i, using the spe trum of the AB problem and the Blo h's\ntheory of e\u001be tive Hamiltonians. In most appli ations\nthe size of the blo ks remains small, several states per\nblo ks are kept, and three and / or four blo ks e\u001be tive intera tions are introdu ed from the knowledge of\nthe spe trum of trimers and / or tetramers of blo ks. A\nspe i\u001c variant of the method has been proposed by two\nof the authors under the name of RSRG-EI\n(RSRG\nwith e\u001be tive intera tions) whi h treats spin latti es by\nonsidering blo ks with an odd number of sites and a\ndoublet ground state whi h is the only one to be expli itily retained. The blo ks are then quasi-spin. From the\nspe trum of dimers or trimers of blo ks one may de\u001cne\nan inter-blo k Heisenberg Hamiltonian. A proper design\nof the blo ks frequently results in an isomorphism between the original latti e and the latti e of blo ks. Hen e\nthe pro ess may be iterated, exhibiting riti al ratios\nof the elementary intera tions and a umulation points.\nThe methodologi al studies have examined the following\n1\n\n2\n\n3,4,5,6\n\n2\n\n7,8,9\n\n- onsider larger blo ks and only dimers of blo ks\n(i.e., two-body e\u001be tive intera tions only) or\n- onsider smaller blo ks and trimers or tetramers\n(i.e.,three and four blo ks intera tions)\nshowing that in most ases the former solution is suf\u001c ient. In a rather similar spirit one may mention the\nblo k orrelated oupled luster method whi h employs\nthe oupled luster formalism\nstarting from the\nprodu t of the ground state eigenfun tions for ea h blo k.\nA similar philosophy (with small blo ks) is present in the\nappli ations of self- onsistent perturbation formalism to\nperiodi latti es. These last two methods do not provide information on the gaps, while CORE and RSRG-EI\nbring good estimates of them.\nThe present work is losely related but is fo used on a\ndire t resear h of the gap. One starts now from blo ks\nonstituted of an even number of sites and having a nondegenerate singlet ground state. The blo ks may be identi al or not, but they must lead to a periodi pi ture\nof the latti e in terms of blo ks (hen e with larger unit\nells). The ground state will be built from produ ts of\nblo k ground states. Considering the exa t energies of\ndimers or trimers of blo ks, one will de\u001cne e\u001be tive intera tions between blo ks in their ground states, produ ing\nan additive energy systemati s.\nFor the study of ex ited states, one will also onsider the lowest states of the blo ks and of the various\ndimers and eventually trimers of blo ks. The knowledge\nof the lowest states of the dimers and trimers (energy\nand eigenve tors) enables one to de\u001cne the e\u001be tive intera tions between an ex ited blo k and neighbor ground\nstate blo ks and e\u001be tive ex itation transfer integrals\nfrom one blo k to its neighbors. These quantities will\nbe de\u001cned through the Blo h's theory of e\u001be tive Hamiltonians. Then the latti e lowest ex itations are treated\nthrough an ex itoni model that makes use of these effe tive quantities. The theory is developed in se tion\nII. Se tion III \u001crst shows the improvement brought by\nthe use of e\u001be tive intera tions rather than of bare intera tions on elementary mono-ele troni problems where\nthe original RSRG version failed. The e\u001e ien y of the\n10\n\n11,12,13\n\n14\n\n\f2\nmethod will then be illustrated on three spin latti es,\nnamely the 1-D frustrated hain, the 1/5-depleted 2-D\nsquare latti e and the plaquette latti e. The three problems exhibit phase transitions (of se ond and \u001crst order)\nwhi h are satisfa torily treated with the here-proposed\nrenormalized ex itoni method (REM).\n\nII. METHOD\nA.

It\nappeared later on that next-nearest neighbor spin ouplings are important in this material, but the simple pi ture, with Jp AF ouplings on plaquette bonds and Jd AF\nouplings between adja ent plaquettes already presents\nan interesting physi s with three phases. When the plaquettes are weakly oupled, i.e., Jp /(Jp + Jd ) = j > jc ,\nthe system, in this plaquette phase, is gapped. It is also\ngapped when the dimers onne ting the plaquettes are\nweakly oupled, i.e., when j < jc\u2032 . This phase is alled\ndimer-phase. In between, i.e., for jc < Jp /(Jp + Jd ) < jc\u2032 ,\nthe latti e keeps a N\u00e9el order and this phase is gapless.\nSeveral studies, using perturbative expansions or quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) al ulations agree on this pi ture and propose jc \u2243 0.4\u00b10.01 and jc\u2032 \u2243 0.51\u00b10.01. We\nhave tested our method on this problem. The simplest\nblo k that one may onsider is the o tagon (see s hema\n(A) of Fig. 4). It is non-degenerate whatever the Jp /Jd\nratio. A tually starting from these blo ks, REM provides\na orre t pi ture of the physi s, sin e the gap disappears\nbetween jc = 0.40967 and jc\u2032 = 0.50945 ( f. Fig. 5).

Two types of trimers (linear and perpendi ular) have to be onsidered. The results appear in Table\n1, and they deserve the following omments\n- the dependen e of the gap on the j ratio is almost\nthe same as when working with dimers only.

This may be\nseen as a signature for a \u001cnite (24 sites) luster of\nthe vi inity of the phase transition in the periodi\nlatti e. A similar phenomenon is observed for the\nlinear trimer between j = 0.40 and j = 0.41. Regarding the N\u00e9el-plaquette phase transition, a similar hange of the target ve tors appears for 0.50 <\nj < 0.51 in the perpendi ular trimer superblo k.\nThis phenomenon of dis ontinuity of H ef f does\nnot appear when working with dimers only.

It is not gapped\nfor the j = J 2-D square latti e, and phase transitions as\nexpe ted to o ur for (j/J)c = \u03bbc and for (J/j)c = 1/\u03bbc\n(this last relation being due to the intrinsi symmetry\nbetween j and J ). Several works have been devoted to\nthis problem. Third order series expansions and QMC\nal ulations suggest that \u03bbc \u2243 0.55. Extrapolations of\n\u001cnite size exa t diagonalizations fail to give a zero spingap whatever the value of \u03bb. A re ent work has used the\nCORE method together with order parameter sus eptibilities, suggesting a riti al behavior between \u03bb = 0.5\nand \u03bb = 0.6. The problem of the gap is reexamined here\nusing REM.\nTwo types of blo ks have been onsiderd.\nThe \u001crst one involves one, two or three plaquettes (n =\n4, 8 and 12 sites), fragments of a ladder (see s hema (A)\nof Fig. 6). There are two types of dimers, ollinear or\n\u2032\nside by side. If one alls \u2206EAB and \u2206EAB\nthe ex itation\nenergies for these dimers, \u2206EA the ex itation energy of\nthe blo k, our model leads to the following expression\nof the gap \u2206E(n1 , n2 ), for a blo k of n1 sites along the\nlongitudinal dire tion, n2 sites along the transverse one,\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\nOne may alternatively hange the shape of the blo ks. A\nstared 8 sites blo k with 4 dimer bonds around a plaquette pi tured in s heme (B) of Fig. 4 is expe ted to be\nrelevant for the dimer phase. The gap al ulated from\nthese blo ks almost oin ides with the previously al ulated one, with a riti al value jc = 0.40 (see Fig. 5).\nFor the plaquette phase we have onsidered blo ks with\none or two plaquettes, all atoms belonging to plaquette\nbonds. The number of sites are 8 and 10 respe tively, as\npi tured in s hemes (C\u2032 ) and (C) of Fig. 4. An extrapolation leads to the urve on the right part of Fig. 5. The\ngap is slightly smaller than from the o tagons, but the\nriti al values of disappearan e of the gap, jc\u2032 = 0.51, oin ide. We have ompared our al ulated gaps with the\nones reported (in Figure 2 of Ref. 22 ) from QMC al ulations, and the two methods pra ti ally oin ide (within\nthe un ertainties of reading of the above-mentioned Figure).\n\n\u2206E(n1 , n2 ) = 2\u2206EAB (2n1 , n2 ) + 2\u2206EAB (n1 , 2n2 )\n\u22123\u2206EA (n1 , n2 ).\n(63)\n\nFig. 7 reports the gap al ulated for n1 = 2, 3, 4 and\nn2 = 2.

The value of\n\u03bbc is somewhat larger than the ommonly a epted value\nbut it represents a onsiderable improvement over the extrapolations of \u001cnite latti es.

The method rests\non the onsideration of blo ks and a trun ation of the\nHilbert spa e to produ ts of a few eigenstates of the blo k\nas pra ti ed in the RSRG. In the past we have onsidered\n(2n + 1) sites blo ks, with spatially non-degenerate doublet ground states, in spin latti es. The blo ks an then\nbe seen as Sz = \u00b11/2 quasi-spins. Using the theory of effe tive Hamiltonians, and the exa t spe trum of dimers\n(or trimers) of blo ks, we have proposed to renormalize the intera tions between blo ks, and the so-obtained\nvariant of CORE (RSRG-EI) happens to keep the oneptual elegan e of Wilson's idea while gaining, at a very\nlow ost, numeri al relevan e.\nThe present work is losely related but di\u001berent. It\nonsiders blo ks with even number of sites, presenting a\nnon-degenerate ground state. Again the exa t treatment\nof the blo k and of the dimers or trimers of blo ks is employed to de\u001cne blo k e\u001be tive energies and inter-blo k\ne\u001be tive intera tions. However di\u001berent model spa es\nare used for the ground state and for the lowest ex ited\nstates. For the ground state \u03a80 , built from the produ t\nof ground states, the energy is a simple sum of intra and\ninter-blo k energies. The ex ited states are linear ombinations of lo ally singly ex ited fun tions, produ ts of an\nex ited state on one blo k by the ground states fun tions\non the other blo ks. This spa e is a small fra tion of those\nhandled in RSRG te hniques. The knowledge of the exited states of dimers or trimers of blo ks enables one to\nde\u001cne the e\u001be tive intera tions between an ex ited blo k\nand its ground state neighbors, as well as e\u001be tive ex itation hopping integrals, whi h delo alize the ex itations.\nThe e\u001be tive intera tions in orporate omplex pro esses,\nin luding multiple ex itations or/and inter-blo k ex ita7,8\n\n\f10\ntions. These informations are used to build an ex itoni\nHamiltonian for the in\u001cnite latti e, and to estimate the\ngap.\nThe method does not provide any information on the\nlow energy physi s of gapless phases but solves some dramati failures of the use of bare intera tions (as they\nmanifest in the original RSRG formalism). It an be applied to various Hamiltonians (Tight-binding, Hubbard,\nHeisenberg, ab-initio). The method has been presented\n(and tested) in its simplest version on spin latti es, with\nidenti al blo ks, one ex ited state per blo k, and extra tion from dimers and trimers. It is possible to generalize\nit to blo ks of di\u001berent sizes or topologies, and one may\nkeep several ex ited states per blo k. The renormalized\nex itoni method has been tested so far to the resear h of\nsinglet-triplet gaps but it is appli able as well to singlet\nto singlet ex itations.
