The main goal is to\nidentify and adopt the best tradeoff between detector's performance and computational cost. In a recent paper [1] we\nintroduced an accurate representation of the cumulative distribution function (henceforth CDF) of the supremum of a\nbank of correlators in the null hypothesis taking into account the nonzero covariance among them, extending previous\nresults by Mohanty [2]. These findings can be used to re-address the following questions: i) whether it really makes\nsense to use the largest number of correlators compatible with the available computing power, and ii) whether the\nsimple argument [3] whereby the fraction of potentially observable sources which would be lost as an effect of template\nsparsity is (1 \u2212 \u03933 ), \u0393 being the minimal match [4] is still valid when one takes into account both the dependence\nof the detection threshold on the total number of correlators, and the covariance among the correlators, at a given\nfalse-alarm level. The above issues are discussed in Sect. 3 and 4 below, while Sect. 2 is aimed at introducing the\nrelevant notation.\nII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe maximum likelihood (henceforth ML) strategy for detecting GW chirps from CBs with unknown parameters\ngoes through the following steps. First, a set of N\u2206 reduced templates[8] is set up, viz.:\nT (f, \u03be~T ) = T0 f \u22127/6 exp[j\u03c8(f, \u03be~T )],\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03c8(f, \u03be~T ) is the (post-newtonian) chirp phasing function [5], \u03be~T represents the intrinsic source parameters\n(binary companion masses and spin parameters), and T0 is a suitable constant. Second, a set of non-coherent reduced\ncorrelators\nC[A, T ] = sup Ff \u2192\u03c4 KA [f, \u03be~T ]\n\n(2.2)\n\n\u03c4\n\nis computed, where F is the Fourier-transform operator and:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 A(f )T \u2217 (f, \u03be~T )\n, f \u2208 (fi , fs )\nKA [f, \u03be~T ] = 2\n\u03a0(f )\n\uf8f3\n0,\nelsewhere.\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn eq. (2.3) A(f ) = S(f ) + N (f ) are the (spectral, noisy) data, resulting from the superposition of a (possibly null)\nsignal S(f ) and a realization N (f ) of the antenna noise, (fi , fs ) is the antenna spectral window, and \u03a0(f ) is the\n(one-sided) antenna noise power spectral density (henceforth PSD). The Fourier transform in (2.2) is implemented\nusing a discrete finite algorithm (DFT). The corresponding number of coalescency times will be henceforth denoted\nby N\u0398 ; each reduced template is thus used to compute N\u0398 (non-reduced) correlators.\nOnce all correlators have been evaluated, the final step consists in comparing the supremum\n\u039b = sup C[A, T ]\n\u03be~T\n\n(2.4)\n\n\f2\n(or any nondecreasing function thereof) to a threshold \u03b3 depending on the prescribed false-alarm probability\n\u03b1 = prob[\u039b > \u03b3|no signal].\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe threshold \u03b3 can be accordingly computed from the no-signal cumulative distribution of \u039b. Whenever \u039b > \u03b3\none declares that a signal has been observed (within false alarm probability \u03b1), and estimates the unknown source\nparameters from those of the template yielding the largest correlator.\nOn the other hand, it can be shown that the false-dismissal probability\n\u03b2 = prob[\u039b \u2264 \u03b3|nonzero signal]\n\n(2.6)\n\nis a decreasing function of the match\nM [S, T ] =\n\nZ\n\nfs\n\nfi\n\nf\n\n\u22127/3\n\ndf\n\u03a0(f )\n\n!\u22121\n\nsup Ff \u2192\u03c4 KS [f, \u03be~T ] ,\n\n(2.7)\n\n\u03c4\n\nbetween the signal S and the (most similar available) template T , where:\n\uf8f1\nn h\nio\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 f \u22127/3 exp j \u03c8(f, \u03be~S ) \u2212 \u03c8(f, \u03be~T )\n,\nKS [f, \u03be~T ] =\n\u03a0(f )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\nelsewhere.\n\nf \u2208 (fi , fs )\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe match is a measure of the similarity between S and T , and is obviously equal to one iff S = T . The reducedtemplate set should be accordingly designed so as to cope with the more or less obvious prescription\n\u2200S \u2208 S, \u2203T \u2208 L : M [S, T ] \u2265 \u0393,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere S and L are the allowed signal and template sets, respectively, and \u0393 is the minimal match [4].\nIII.\n\nMINIMAL MATCH VS. NUMBER OF TEMPLATES\n\nThe natural question is how many reduced templates one should use in practice. The standard argument suggests\nusing the largest total number N\u2206 of (reduced) templates in the allowed (reduced) parameter-space search subset,\ncompatible with the available computing power, so as to achieve the largest-minimal-match \u0393 over the class of admissible sources.\nIn this connection, it should be stressed first that a visible knee point in the \u0393 vs. N\u2206 curve invariably exists at some\nvalue N\u2206 = N\u2217 , beyond which any further increase in N\u2206 yields only a modest increase in \u0393.\nThis is illustrated in Fig.1 for the simplest case of the one-parameter family of (reduced) newtonian waveforms in the\nrange of chirp masses (0.2M\u2299 \u2264 M \u2264 10M\u2299). To compute the curve in Fig. 1 we used the (initial) LIGO noise PSD\n[6],\n(\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u0012 \u00132 )\n1\nf0\nf\n\u03a0(f ) =\n1+\n+2\n,\n(3.1)\n4\nf\nf0\nwith f0 = 300 Hz, fi = 40Hz and fs = 400Hz; we sampled the data at 3.2KHz (4-times the Nyquist rate), and let\nN\u0398 = 221 , which corresponds to the longest-lived source allowed (M = 0.2M\u2299 ).\nA knee point separating intervals of different (almost constant) slope in the \u0393 versus N\u2206 curve occurs in Fig. 1 at\nN\u2206 \u2248 5 * 103 . Except for the numerical value of N\u2217 , the existence of the above knee point is a generic feature of the\n\u0393 vs. N\u2206 curve, occurring also for more realistic, higher-order post-newtonian waveforms and templates.\nIV.\n\nUNDETECTED OBSERVABLE SOURCES VS. NUMBER OF TEMPLATES\n\nIt was first argued in [3] that (under the simplest assumption of isotropically and homogeneously distributed sources)\nthe fraction of potentially observable sources which would be undetected as an effect of template mismatch is (1 \u2212 \u03933 ).\nThis argument conceals an obvious naivety insofar as it neglects the dependence of the detection threshold \u03b3 corresponding to a given false-alarm probability \u03b1 on the total number of templates N = N\u0398 N\u2206 , and hence on \u0393 itself.\n\n\f3\nIn order to gain insight into this issue, it is expedient to work in terms of the detection probability Pd , and capitalize\non the accurate approximate representations for the no-signal cumulative distribution of the whole-bank supremum\nobtained in [1], which is needed to compute the threshold \u03b3 corresponding to a given \u03b1.\nAccordingly, let\nPd = 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 Q[\u03b3 \u2212 E(\u039b)]\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere Q(*) is an unknown CDF, whose density can be nonetheless safely assumed as being unimodal and centersymmetric, at least for meaningful values of the signal-to-noise ratio. In the worst case of minimal match,\nE(\u039b) \u2248 \u0393d,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere d is the signal deflection (signal-to-noise ratio), viz.:\nd := 2\n\nZ\n\nfs\n\nfi\n\nS(f )S \u2217 (f )\ndf\n\u03a0(f )\n\n1/2\n\n,\n\n(4.3)\n\nand we assume d \u226b 1. Let the observable sources be those for which Pd \u2265 0.5. Under the above assumptions for Q(*),\nthese correspond to:\nd\u2265\n\n\u03b3\n.\n\u0393\n\n(4.4)\n\nd=\n\nK\nR\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe deflection d on the other hand can be written\n\nwhere R is the source distance, and K is a constant depending on the antenna and source features, as well as their\nmutual orientation. Equation (4.4) allows to define the radius R of the antenna-centered sphere which contains all\nsources of a given class (seen by the same antenna, sharing the same features and orientation) producing a deflection\nd \u2265 \u03b3 (i.e., observable), viz.:\nR=\n\nK\u0393\n.\n\u03b3\n\n(4.6)\n\nHence the number of observable sources in the given class, under the most obvious hypothesis of uniform (homogeneous\nand isotropic) spatial source density \u03c1s is:\n\u0014\n\u00153\nK\u0393\n4\n.\nNs = \u03c0\u03c1s\n3\n\u03b3\n\n(4.7)\n\nLetting \u0393max , Nmax the largest achievable minimal match, and the related number of templates, and denoting as\n(max)\nNs\nthe corresponding value of Ns , one has from (4.7):\n\u03b7=\n\nNs\n(max)\n\nNs\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393\n\u0393max\n\n\u00133 \u0014\n\n\u03b3(\u03b1, Nmax )\n\u03b3(\u03b1, N )\n\n\u00153\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere the dependence of \u03b3 from \u03b1 and N has been written explicitly. The quantity 1 \u2212 \u03b7 represents the fraction\nof observable sources which would be lost due to poor minimal match (\u0393 < \u0393max ). Note that the ratio \u03b7 does not\ndepend on K.\nNeglecting the dependance of \u03b3 on N (and hence on \u0393), the second factor on the r.h.s. of (4.8) cancels, and we are\nleft with\n\u0012\n\u00133\n\u0393\n\u03b7=\n:= \u03b70 ,\n(4.9)\n\u0393max\nwhich does not depend on \u03b1. Under the same assumption, Ns in (4.7) increases monotically with \u0393, attaining its\n(max)\nsupremum Ns\nat \u0393max = 1, yielding \u03b70 = \u03933 . This is, in essence, the simplest argument introduced in [3].\nIn order to refine this reasoning one should obviously include the dependence of \u03b3 on N , which in turn is affected\nby the covariance among the correlators [1]. For illustrative purposes, we shall again stick at the simplest case of\n\n\f4\nnewtonian signals and templates, using the same parameters as in Fig. 1, and use the best available approximant\nfor the no-signal CDF of the detection statistic \u039b from [1] in order to compute the ratio \u03b3(\u03b1, Nmax )/\u03b3(\u03b1, N ) on\nthe r.h.s. of (4.8)[9]. In Fig. 2 we accordingly compare \u03b70 (eq. (4.9), dashed line), to \u03b7 (eq. (4.8), solid lines),\nfor \u03b1 = 10\u2212k , k = 2, 3, 4 (top-to bottom), as functions of N\u2206 . In Fig. 2 we assumed \u0393max = 0.99 as a bona fide\npractical limit value, and computed Nmax accordingly. From Fig. 2 it is seen that a knee-point in the curves exists at\nN\u2206 \u2248 N\u2217 \u2248 5 * 103 . It is also seen that \u03b7 exceeds by a non-negligible 5% typ. the plain estimate \u03b70 , for N\u2206 \u2248 N\u2217 , if\nthe best available approximant for the no-signal CDF of the detection statistic \u039b is used to compute the threshold[10].\nIt is also interesting to compare in terms of \u03b7 alternative (less accurate, i.e., yielding larger thresholds for the same\n(max)\n\u03b1 and N ) approximants for the no-signal CDF of the detection statistic \u039b. This is obtained by computing Ns\nusing the best available approximant, i.e., using this latter to compute \u03b3(\u03b1, Nmax ) in (4.8). The resulting curves\nare shown in Fig. 3, where again we assumed \u0393max = 0.99 as a bona fide practical limit-value, and computed\nNmax accordingly. Specifically, the (scaled) quantities \u03b7 (0,1,2) in Fig. 3 correspond to ignoring the covariance\namong the correlators (dotted line), and to including the covariance among nearest-neighbour correlators along one\n(coalescency-time, dashed line) or both (coalescency-time and chirp-mass, solid line, best available approximant)\ncoordinates of the newtonian parameter-space, respectively [1]. For each case, the \u03b7 vs. N\u2206 curves corresponding to\n\u03b1 = 10\u22122 , 10\u22123 , 10\u22124 are displayed. It is seen that the dependence of \u03b7 on \u03b1 becomes the less relevant, the better\napproximant is used.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOn the basis of the above findings, the following conclusions can be drawn. Inspection of Fig.s 1 and 2, shows a\nconsistent evidence that increasing the number of templates beyond a critical value corresponding to the knee-point\nin the curve of \u0393 vs. N\u2206 (Fig. 1), does not produce a sensible increase in the detectable fraction of potentially\nobservable sources, at the expense of a marked growth of computational load. On the other hand, using the presently\nmost accurate available representation of the no-signal cumulative distribution of the (whole-bank) detection statistic\nto compute the threshold results in a sizeable increase (\u2265 5%) in the detectable fraction of potentially observable\nsources over the naive \u221d \u03933 estimate.\nBoth findings above support the current trend [7] toward the use of hierarchical search strategies for best tradeoff\nbetween detector's performance and computational burden.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work has been sponsored in part by the European Community through a Senior Visiting Scientist Grant to\nI.M.
