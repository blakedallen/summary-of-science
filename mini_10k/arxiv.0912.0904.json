Introduction\nA Hamiltonian circle action on a compact symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) can\nbe viewed as a loop in the group Ham(M, \u03c9) of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms,\nparametrized by R/Z. We are concerned with deforming this loop, through\nloops in Ham(M, \u03c9), into a loop whose Hofer length is smaller. In short,\nwe call such a deformation \"shortening\". The reader may go directly to\nSection 3 for the precise statements of the new results that we prove in this\npaper.\nOne motivation for such a study comesRfrom Riemannian geometry, where\n1\none studies the action functional \u03b3 7\u2192 0 k\u03b3\u0307(t)k2 dt on spaces of loops or\npaths with fixed endpoints in a compact Riemannian manifold. Critical\npoints are geodesics; the index of a critical point is finite and is equal to the\nnumber (counting multiplicity) of conjugate points along the geodesic; every\nhomotopy class contains a minimal geodesic. Morse theory in this context\nhas played a major role in the study of the topology of compact Lie groups.\nSee Milnor's book [17].\nThe infinite dimensional group Ham(M, \u03c9) is a central object in symplectic geometry. It has a natural Finsler metric, introduced by Hofer, which\ninduces a non-trivial distance function. The length of a path \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192\nHam(M, \u03c9) with respect to this Finsler metric is called the Hofer length of\n\u03b3. It is equal to the sum of the positive Hofer length and the negative Hofer\nlength; see section 2.\nThere have been various attempts to extend to this setting notions that\nhad been applied successfully to the action functional of Riemannian geometry. The situation here is more difficult and it is not yet clear to what\nextent the analogy can be carried out. But the partial results that exist are\nbeautiful and deep. A main theme is to express Morse properties of Hofer's\nfunctional on a space of paths in Ham(M, \u03c9) in terms of the dynamics of the\nflows on M given by these paths.\nThere are several notions of \"geodesic path\" in Ham(M, \u03c9). With all of\nthese notions, every time-independent Hamiltonian flow is geodesic. (But\nnot every geodesic is time-independent.) Thus, every Hamiltonian circle\naction is a geodesic loop in Ham(M, \u03c9).\nStarting with a Hamiltonian circle action {\u03c6t : M \u2192 M }0\u2264t\u22641 on a compact connected symplectic manifold, here is a sample of known results. Considering the opposite circle action gives the analogous results with \"maximum\" replaced by \"minimum\" and \"positive Hofer length\" replaced by\n\"negative Hofer length\".\n(1) Suppose that the circle action is semi-free near the set where the\nmomentum map is maximal. (Semi-free means that only the trivial\ngroup and the entire circle occur as stabilizers.) Then its positive\n\n\fSHORTENING HOFER LENGTH OF CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n3\n\nHofer length is minimal among homotopic loops. See [19], the paragraph after Thm. 1.21, whose proof relies on [15, Thm. 1.9].\nIn particular, if the circle action is semi-free on M then it is lengthminimizing among homotopic loops in Ham(M, \u03c9). This was already\nshown by McDuff-Slimowitz [14, Theorem 1.4].\nAnother consequence is that, if the circle action is semi-free near\nthe set where the momentum map is maximal, then the circle action is non-contractible in Ham(M, \u03c9). This was already shown by\nMcDuff-Tolman [15, Theorem 1.1].\n(2) Suppose that the momentum map attains its maximum at an isolated\nfixed point and that the circle action is not semi-free near the maximum. Then the circle action can be deformed to a loop in Ham(M, \u03c9)\nwhose Hofer length is smaller. See Ustilovsky [24, Theorem 1.2.E].\n(3) If n is a sufficiently large integer, then the non-effective circle action\n{\u03c6nt }0\u2264t\u22641 can be deformed into a loop of smaller Hofer length. See\nPolterovich [18, p. 86].\nLet B be the set where the momentum map attains its maximum.\nIf there exists a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism g such that g(B) \u2229 B =\n\u2205, then the non-effective circle action {\u03c62t }0\u2264t\u22641 can be deformed to\na loop in Ham(M, \u03c9) of smaller Hofer length. See Polterovich [18,\nTheorem 8.2.H].\nMany results in the literature apply to spaces of paths in Ham(M, \u03c9)\nwith fixed endpoints and to geodesic loops or paths that are possibly timedependent. We refer the reader to the papers by Hofer [7], Bialy-Polterovich [3],\nYi Ming Long [12], Siburg [22], Ustilovsky [24], Lalonde-McDuff [10, 11],\nMcDuff-Slimowitz [14], McDuff [13], and Savelyev [19, 20]. Polterovich's\nbook [18] contains systematic explanations of many results in the subject.\nExample 1.1. Let e2\u03c0it \u2208 S 1 act on CP2 by [u, z, w] 7\u2192 [u, e\u22122\u03c0it z, e2\u03c0it w],\nwith the Fubini Study form normalized such that the momentum map is\n(|w|2 \u2212 |z|2 )/(|u|2 + |z|2 + |w|2 ) + constant. Take an equivariant blow-up\nat the point [0, \u22c6, 0] where the momentum map is minimal. This yields a\nHamiltonian circle action on a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) whose isotropy\nweights where the momentum map is maximal are \u22121, \u22122 and whose isotropy\nweights where the momentum map is minimal are 1, 1. It is an effective circle\naction that represents a non-trivial element of \u03c01 (M, \u03c9) (by the above item\n(1), applied to the minimum) but that can be deformed into a shorter loop\nin Ham(M, \u03c9) (by the above item (2), applied to the maximum).\nTypically, to show that a geodesic cannot be deformed to a loop of smaller\nHofer length requires \"hard\" holomorphic curve techniques, whereas to show\nthat a geodesic can be shortened is possible with \"soft\" techniques.\n\n\f4\n\nY. KARSHON AND J. SLIMOWITZ\n\nIn this paper we use \"soft\" techniques to explore the behaviour of the\nHofer length functional as we deform a Hamiltonian circle action within the\nspace of loops in Ham(M, \u03c9). Starting with a circle action is a very restrictive\nassumption, but it allows us to obtain new results that do not follow from\ngeneral existing results. Our new results are sketched in the abstract and\nstated in Section 3. In brief,\n\u22c6 Our Theorem 3.1 is the first quantitative shortening estimate for\neffective Hamiltonian circle actions.\n\u22c6 Our Theorem 3.7, Theorem 3.9, and Corollary 3.12 are the first shortening results that apply when the extrema of the momentum map\nare not necessarily displaceable and the circle action is effective.\n\u22c6 Our Theorem 3.17 gives a lower bound on the index of the Hofer\nlength functional. It confirms a prediction of Yasha Savelyev. (But\nsee Remark 1.2.)\nWe now give an overview of the paper.\nIn Section 2 we review standard background material. The purpose of this\nreview is to remind equivariant symplectic geometers of facts about timedependent Hamiltonian flows and to remind symplectic topologists of facts\nabout momentum maps. In Section 3 we state our results, give examples,\nand pose further questions.\nIn Sections 4\u20137 we develop the main tools for the later proofs of our main\nresults. We warm up by describing, in Section 4, Polterovich's shortening\ntrick for non-effective circle actions (item (3) in the above sample of known\nresults). In our later proofs we use variations of this Polterovich trick; we\ngive such variations in Section 5: take a Hamiltonian circle action with\nmomentum map H, and assume that, near the set where H is maximal,\nwe can write H = K + F where K and F also generate circle actions.\nAlso assume that the sets where K and F are maximal have non-empty\nintersection, and that there exists a symplectic isotopy that disjoins the first\nof these sets from the second. Finally, assume that the infimum of the sum\nof K and F is equal to the sum of their infima. We deduce that the circle\naction can be deformed to a shorter loop in Ham(M, \u03c9), and we estimate\nthe amount by which this loop is shorter. Our actual statement is slightly\nmore technical; see Lemma 5.1. The qualitative part of this result can be\nstrengthened if H decomposes, near its maximum, into a sum of more than\ntwo momentum maps; see Lemma 5.10. Sections 6 and 7 contain variations\non the simple fact that a disc of area A1 can be disjoined from a disc of area\nA2 inside a disc of area greater than A1 + A2 . See Lemmas 6.1 and 7.1.\nIn Section 8 we prove our first new result, Theorem 3.1: when the momentum map attains its maximum at an isolated fixed point and one of\n\n\fSHORTENING HOFER LENGTH OF CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n5\n\nthe isotropy weights has absolute value \u2265 2, we give a lower bound for the\namount of possible shortening, in terms of the gap between the two largest\ncritical values of the momentum map. The proof consists of the following\nsteps. There exists an equivariant Darboux chart whose image is the entire\nset of points where the momentum map is larger than the second-largest\ncritical value; this set can be identified with an ellipsoid in Cn . We view\nthis ellipsoid as a family of discs in C parametrized by points in a subset of\nCn\u22121 , where the circle action on the C component is non-effective. From the\nresults of Section 5 we get shortening by an amount that depends on the size\nof a family of discs that can be disjoined from another such family through\na Hamiltonian isotopy supported in the ellipsoid. Such an estimate, in turn,\nis obtained from the results of Section 7. For effective circle actions, these\nare the first shortening results that are quantitative.\nIn Sections 9 and 10 we prove our second new result (more precisely,\nset of results). We now allow the momentum map to attain its maximum\nalong a submanifold B of positive dimension. To describe a neighbourhood\nof B in M , we use Sternberg's minimal coupling procedure and Weinstein's\nsymplectic tubular neighbourhood theorem. Let E denote the normal bundle\nof B in M . In the simplest case, we may assume that E has k sections that\nare nowhere all vanishing, where k + 1 is the smallest absolute value of an\nisotropy weight in E. In the general case, we make a similar assumption for\na sub-bundle E \u2032 of E. The idea of the proof is to express the circle action\nas a composition of k + 1 circle actions on a neighbourhood of B and to\nthen apply the results of Section 5. For the precise results, and for some\nspecial cases, see Theorems 3.7 and 3.9 and Corollary 3.12. These are the\nfirst shortening results when the maximum is attained along a manifold that\nis not necessarily displaceable and the circle action is effective.\nFinally, in Section 11, we prove our third new result, Theorem 3.17: we\ngive a lower bound for the index of the Hofer length functional, assuming that\nthe momentum map attains its maximum at an isolated fixed point. Composing with an equivariant Darboux chart, we may work with a linear circle\naction on Cn that rotates the coordinates of Cn with speeds \u2212k1 , . . . , \u2212kn ,\nwhere the kj s are positive integers. We write the action on the jth coordinate as a composition of kj terms, \u03c6t \u25e6. . . \u25e6\u03c6t , where \u03c6\u2212t generates the scalar\nmultiplication circle action. We obtain a family of shortenings by applying\nPolterovich's trick of Section 4 to the different factors of these compositions:\nin each coordinate, we conjugate all but one of the \u03c6t s by a translation\nof C. Varying over the two\nPdimensional family of translations of C, independently in each one of the (kj \u2212 1)Pconjugations, we obtain a family of loops\nin Ham(M, \u03c9) that depends on 2 (kj \u2212 1) real parameters and such that\nthe original circle action corresponds to the origin in the parameter space\n\n\f6\n\nY. KARSHON AND J. SLIMOWITZ\nP\n\nR2 (kj \u22121) . An explicit computation\nthen shows that the Hofer length of\nP\nthese loops, as a function on R2 (kj \u22121) , achieves its maximum at the origin,\nand its Hessian is negative definite at the origin. This confirms one direction\nof a prediction for the index that was made by Yasha Savelyev.\nRemark 1.2. While completing this paper, we learned that Savelyev [21] can\nnow confirm his conjecture with the methods of Ustilovsky [24].\n\nThis paper is the outgrowth of a joint project that took place in the years\n1999-2001. Yael Karshon takes the responsibility for any errors that might\nbe present.\nAcknowledgement We thank Leonid Polterovich for inspiring conversations and helpful suggestions.

It follows that the flux of a closed loop\nof symplectomorphisms is a class in H 1 (M ; R) whose evaluation on elements\nof H1 (M ; Z) takes values in the countable set h\u03c9, H2 (M ; Z)i. Such classes\nmake up a countable subgroup of H 1 (M ; R).\nSuppose that {\u03c8t } is a path of symplectomorphisms and that each \u03c8t is\nHamiltonian. Then for each t the path {\u03c8\u03c4 }0\u2264\u03c4 \u2264t can be completed to a\nclosed loop of symplectomorphisms by a Hamiltonian isotopy. This completion does not effect the flux. So t 7\u2192 Flux({\u03c8\u03c4 }0\u2264\u03c4 \u2264t ) is a continuous map\nthat takes values in a countable subgroup of H 1 (M ; R). Such a map must\nbe constant. Since it is zero for t = 0, it is zero for all t.\nHamiltonian circle actions. Let (M, \u03c9) be a symplectic manifold with a\ncircle action generated by a Hamiltonian H : M \u2192 R. The momentum map\nfor the circle action is the Hamiltonian H.\nThe critical points of H are the fixed points for the circle action. Let\np \u2208 M be such a point. The linearized isotropy action on Tp M is linearly equivariantly symplectomorphic to Cn with the standard symplectic\nform and with the circle acting as a subgroup of (S 1 )n , namely, e2\u03c0it *\n(z1 , . . . , zn ) = (e2\u03c0ik1 t z1 , . . . , e2\u03c0ikn t zn ). The integers k1 , . . . , kn , which measure the speeds at which the linearized S 1 -action rotates its eigenspaces, are\ncalled the isotropy weights at p. They are unique up to permutation. This\nisomorphism Tp M \u223c\n= Cn carries the Hessian of H to the quadratic form\n2\n\u03c0k1 |z1 | + . . . + \u03c0kn |zn |2 . So if H attains its maximum at p then all the\nisotropy weights at p are non-positive.\nThe equivariant Darboux theorem asserts that a neighbourhood of p in\nM is equivariantly symplectomorphic to a neighbourhood of the origin in\nTp M . In particular, if p is an isolated fixed point then the isotropy weights\nat p are all non-zero. Thus, at least one isotropy weight at p has absolute\nvalue greater than one if and only if every neighbourhood of p contains a\npoint whose stabilizer is finite and non-trivial. Also, the set Bmax where H\nis maximal is a symplectic submanifold, and the circle acts on the fibres of\nits normal bundle with negative weights.\nThe momentum map H is a Bott-Morse function with even indices and\ncoindices. Assuming that M is compact and connected, this implies that the\nlevel sets of H are connected and that preimages of intervals are connected.\nThus, the maximum of H is attained along a connected component of the\nfixed point set. If a fixed point p is a local maximum for H then it is\nalso a global maximum. If a neighbourhood of p in M is equivariantly\n\n\fSHORTENING HOFER LENGTH OF CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n9\n\nP\nsymplectomorphic\nto the ellipsoid {z |\nkj \u03c0|zj |2 < \u01eb} with the momentum\nP\n2\nmap \u2212 kj \u03c0|zj | , then this neighbourhood contains all the points in M\nwhere H is \u01eb-close to its maximum.\nSee [1, 5].\n3. New results and further questions\nIn this section we state our main results. We prove them in Sections 8,\n10, and 11. We also give some examples, corollaries, and further questions.\nIn each of these results, we start with a Hamiltonian circle action, viewed\nas a loop in the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, and we deform it to a\nloop whose Hofer length is smaller. Moreover, throughout the deformation,\nthe negative Hofer length remains constant, and the positive Hofer length\neventually becomes smaller without ever becoming larger than the initial\none.\nShortening on a manifold with an isolated maximum.\nTheorem 3.1. Let (M, \u03c9) be a compact connected symplectic manifold with\na Hamiltonian circle action. Suppose that the momentum map attains its\nmaximum at an isolated fixed point and that at least one of the isotropy\nweights at that point has absolute value greater than one. Let d be a positive\nnumber that is smaller than the gap between the two largest critical values\nof the momentum map. Then the circle action can be deformed to a loop\nin Ham(M, \u03c9) whose Hofer length is smaller than that of the original circle\naction by 2d/9.\nRemark 3.2. In Theorem 3.1, we can choose the deformation such that the\npositive Hofer length never exceeds the initial one and the negative Hofer\nlength remains constant. Specifically, let H denote the momentum map, let\npmax denote the point where H attains its maximum, let \u03b1 denote the gap\nbetween the two largest critical values of H, and consider the subset of M\ngiven by\n{m | H(m) > H(pmax ) \u2212 \u03b1}.\n\n(3.3)\n\nWe can choose the deformation such that the normalized deformed Hamiltonians remain greater than H(pmax ) \u2212 \u03b1 on the set (3.3) and coincide with H\noutside this set.\nRemark 3.4. In Theorem 3.1, we actually obtain a better estimate than 29 d.\nIf one of the isotropy weights is even then we can shorten by 14 d. Otherwise,\nlet \u2212k1 be the weight whose absolute value is largest; then we can shorten\nby 14 (1 \u2212 k12 )d. When k1 = 3, this becomes 92 d.\n1\n\n\f10\n\nY. KARSHON AND J. SLIMOWITZ\n\nThis is the first quantitative result for shortening of loops in Ham(M, \u03c9)\nthat are effective circle actions. We prove it in Section 8.\nThe estimate of Theorem 3.1 is far from sharp, as we see in the following\nexample.\nExample 3.5. Let a, b be positive integers that are relatively prime. Let\ne2\u03c0it \u2208 S 1 act on CP2 by [u, z, w] 7\u2192 [u, e\u22122\u03c0ita z, e2\u03c0itb w], with the FubiniStudy form normalized such that the momentum map is (\u2212a|z|2 +b|w|2 )/(|u|2 +\n|z|2 + |w|2 ) + constant. The Hofer length of this action is a + b. The isotropy\nweights at the maximum are \u2212b, \u2212(a + b); the isotropy weights at the minimum are a, a + b. Applying the shortening result of Theorem 3.1 and the\nanalogous result with maximum replaced by minimum, for any \u01eb > 0 we\ncan deform the circle action to a loop of Hofer length < 7/9(a + b) + \u01eb.\nThis upper bound is greater than one. But the action can be deformed to\na loop of Hofer length one or zero, so the bound is not optimal. (To see\nthat the action can be deformed to a loop of Hofer length one or zero, notice that the action extends to an action of PU(3), that \u03c01 (PU(3)) \u223c\n= Z/3Z,\nand that the non-trivial elements of \u03c01 (PU(3)) are represented by the actions [u, z, w] 7\u2192 [u, e\u22122\u03c0it z, w] and [u, z, w] 7\u2192 [u, z, e2\u03c0it w], which have Hofer\nlength equal to one.)\nRemark 3.6. The above example is inspired by Proposition 1.3 of the paper [16] of McDuff and Tolman: if G is a compact Lie group with trivial\ncentre and M is a coadjoint orbit of G, then every non-trivial element of\n\u03c01 (G) is represented by a sub-circle of G that acts on M semi-freely.\nShortening on a manifold with an arbitrary maximum.\nRecall that, on a compact connected symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian circle action, the set where the momentum map is maximal is a\nconnected symplectic submanifold.\nIn the following theorem, a subset B of a symplectic manifold M is symplectically k-displaceable in a neighbourhood V if there exist k symplectomorphisms b1 , . . . , bk of M , each connected to the identity through a path of\nsymplectomorphisms supported in V , such that B \u2229 b1 (B) \u2229 . . . \u2229 bk (B) = \u2205.\nIn the symplectic literature, \"B is displaceable\" often means that there\nexists a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism g such that B \u2229 g(B) = \u2205. Thus,\na set can be symplectically k-displaceable in every neighbourhood without\nbeing displaceable (even when k = 1).\nTheorem 3.7. Let (M, \u03c9) be a compact connected symplectic manifold with\na Hamiltonian circle action. Let Bmax be the set where the momentum map\nis maximal. Let \u2212k1 , . . . , \u2212ks denote the distinct weights for the circle action\non the normal bundle of Bmax , and let k := min{k1 , . . . , ks } \u2212 1. Suppose\n\n\fSHORTENING HOFER LENGTH OF CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n11\n\nthat Bmax is symplectically k-displaceable in every neighbourhood. Then the\ncircle action can be deformed through loops in Ham(M, \u03c9) into a loop of\nsmaller Hofer length.\nRemark 3.8. In Theorem 3.7, we can choose the deformation such that the\npositive Hofer length never exceeds the initial one and the negative Hofer\nlength remains constant. Specifically, let H denote the momentum map. For\nevery positive number \u03b1, we can choose the deformation such that the normalized deformed Hamiltonians remain between H(Bmax ) \u2212 \u03b1 and H(Bmax )\non the set {m \u2208 M | H(m) > H(Bmax ) \u2212 \u03b1} and coincide with H outside\nthis set.\nIn practice, the easiest way to show that a symplectic submanifold is\nsymplectically k-displaceable in every neighbourhood is to show that its normal bundle has k sections that are nowhere all vanishing. (k-displaceability\nthen follows from the symplectic tubular neighbourhood theorem (9.5) and\nLemma 9.10.) More generally, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.9. Let (M, \u03c9) be a compact connected symplectic manifold with\na Hamiltonian circle action. Let Bmax be the set where the momentum map\nis maximal. Let E \u2032 \u2192 Bmax be an S 1 -invariant subbundle of the normal\nbundle to Bmax in M , and let \u2212k1\u2032 , . . . , \u2212ks\u2032 \u2032 be the distinct weights for the\ncircle action on E \u2032 . Let\nk\u2032 = min{k1\u2032 , . . . , ks\u2032 \u2032 } \u2212 1.\nSuppose that\n(3.10)\n\nE \u2032 has k\u2032 sections that are nowhere all vanishing.\n\nThen the circle action can be deformed through loops in Ham(M, \u03c9) into a\nloop of smaller Hofer length.\nRemark 3.11. In Theorem 3.9, we can choose the deformation such that\nthe positive Hofer length never exceeds the initial one and the negative\nHofer length remains constant. Specifically, let H denote the momentum\nmap. For every positive number \u03b1, we can choose the deformation such that\nthe normalized deformed Hamiltonians remain between H(Bmax ) \u2212 \u03b1 and\nH(Bmax ) on the set {m \u2208 M | H(m) > H(Bmax ) \u2212 \u03b1} and coincide with H\noutside this set.\nTheorem 3.9 has the following corollaries.\nCorollary 3.12. Let (M, \u03c9) be a compact symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian circle action. Let Bmax be the subset of M where the momentum map\nattains its maximum. Let E denote the normal bundle of Bmax in M and\n\u2212k1 , . . . , \u2212ks the distinct weights for the circle action on E. Suppose that\none of the following conditions holds.\n\n\f12\n\nY. KARSHON AND J. SLIMOWITZ\n\n(1) The normal bundle of Bmax in M has a trivial sub-bundle on which\nthe circle acts with a weight of absolute value \u2265 2.\n(In particular, this holds under the assumptions of Theorem 3.1.)\n(2) We have\ndim Bmax\nkj > 1 +\ncodim Bmax\nfor all j \u2208 {1, . . . , s}.\n(3) After a possible relabeling, assume that k1 < . . . < ks . Let Ej denote\nthe sub-bundle where the circle acts with weight \u2212kj . There exists\nj \u2208 {1, . . . , s} such that\n(kj \u2212 1) rank(Ej \u2295 . . . \u2295 Es ) > dim Bmax .\n(For j = 1, this condition amounts to case (2).)\nThen the circle action can be deformed through loops in Ham(M, \u03c9) to a loop\nof smaller Hofer length.\nMoreover, we can choose a deformation with the properties described in\nRemark 3.11.\nProof of Corollary 3.12. In each of the three cases, (3.10) holds for an appropriate choice of sub-bundle E \u2032 :\n(1) Let E \u2032 be a trivial sub-bundle of E on which S 1 acts with a weight\n\u2212k1\u2032 of absolute value k1 \u2265 2. Then k\u2032 = k1\u2032 \u2212 1 \u2265 1, and (3.10) holds\nbecause E \u2032 is trivial.\n(2) Let E \u2032 = E. Then rank E \u2032 = codim Bmax . Our assumption on the\ndim Bmax\n\u2032\n\u2032\nweights give k\u2032 > codim\nBmax . So k rank E > dim Bmax , and (3.10)\nholds for generic sections.\n(3) Let E \u2032 = Ej \u2295 . . . \u2295 Es . Then k\u2032 = kj \u2212 1. The assumption on\nthe weights gives k\u2032 rank E \u2032 > dim Bmax , and again (3.10) holds for\ngeneric sections.\nIn each of these cases, the shortening result follows from Theorem 3.9. \u0003\nRemark 3.13. Let k and k\u2032 be as in Theorems 3.7 and 3.9. Existence of k\u2032\nsections of E \u2032 that are nowhere all vanishing does not necessarily imply the\nexistence of k sections of E that are nowhere all vanishing, because k\u2032 can\nbe larger than k. So Theorem 3.9 does not follow from Theorem 3.7.\nRemark 3.14. Informally, the assumptions of Theorems 3.7 and 3.9 and\nCorollary 3.12 mean that the normal bundle is \"sufficiently untwisted\".\nRemark 3.15. There seems to be an interesting relationship with the work\nof McDuff-Tolman. In the terminology of Section 1.1 of McDuff-Tolman's\npaper [15], the component Bmax is homologically visible if and only if the\nEuler class of the obstruction bundle (E1 \u2297 Ck1 \u22121 ) \u2295 . . . \u2295 (Es \u2297 Cks \u22121 )\n\n\fSHORTENING HOFER LENGTH OF CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n13\n\nis non-zero. Here, k1 , . . . , ks are the weights of the circle action on the\nnormal bundle, and Ej is the subbundle on which the circle acts with weight\nkj . By Theorem 1.2 of [15], if Bmax is homologically visible then the circle\naction is non-contractible in Ham(M, \u03c9). (We are not sure whether Bmax\nbeing homologically visible further implies that the circle action is minimal\namong homotopic loops. Proposition 3.3 of [15] might be relevant.) The\ncondition (3.10) of our Theorem 3.9 implies that Bmax is not homologically\nvisible. (k\u2032 sections of E \u2032 that are nowhere all vanishing can be considered\n\u2032\nas a non-vanishing section of E \u2032 \u2297 Ck . Writing E \u2032 = E1\u2032 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Es\u2032 where\nthe circle acts on Ej\u2032 with weight kj , we get a nonvanishing section of (E1\u2032 \u2297\n\u2032\n\u2032\nCk ) \u2295 . . . \u2295 (Es\u2032 \u2032 \u2297 Ck ). Because k\u2032 \u2264 kj\u2032 \u2212 1 for all j = 1, . . . , s\u2032 , we get\n\u2032\n\u2032\na non-vanishing section of (E1\u2032 \u2297 Ck1 \u22121 ) \u2295 . . . \u2295 (Es\u2032 \u2032 \u2297 Cks \u22121 ). Because\nthis is a subbundle of the obstruction bundle, the obstruction bundle has a\nnon-vanishing section, and hence its Euler class is zero.)\nWe prove Theorems 3.7 and 3.9 in Section 10. These are the first shortening results that apply to situations when the maximum is not necessarily\ndisplaceable.\nExample 3.16. Let e2\u03c0it \u2208 S 1 act on CP4 by\n[z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 ] 7\u2192 [z0 , z1 , e\u22122\u03c0it z2 , e\u22122\u03c0it*2 z3 , e\u22122\u03c0it*3 z4 ],\nwith momentum map (\u2212|z2 |2 \u2212 2|z3 |2 \u2212 3|z4 |2 )/(|z0 |2 + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 +\n|z4 |2 ) + constant. The momentum map attains its maximum along the submanifold Bmax = {[z0 , z1 , 0, 0, 0]}, which is isomorphic to CP1 . The negative\nisotropy weights along Bmax are \u22121, \u22122, \u22123. The momentum map attains\nits minimum at the isolated fixed point [0, 0, 0, 0, z4 ]. The isotropy weights\nat the minimum are 1, 2, 3, 3.

Also\napplying Theorem 3.1 at the minimum, we conclude that the circle action can be deformed to a loop whose positive Hofer length and negative\nHofer length are both smaller. Nevertheless, the circle action is not contractible in Ham(M, \u03c9): it is homotopic (in PU(5)) to the circle action\n[z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 ] 7\u2192 [e\u22122\u03c0it z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 ], which is semi-free and thus\nnon-contractible (by item (1) on p. 2).\n\n\f14\n\nY.

In fact, we can choose the deformation such that the negative\nHofer length remains constant. Specifically, let H denote the momentum\nmap, and let pmax denote the point where H attains its maximum.

Then H t (m) =\nH(m) and H(m) \u2264 max H \u2212 \u01eb, so\nH t (m) \u2264 max H \u2212 \u01eb.\nNow suppose that m is in i(U ), say, m = i(u) for u \u2208 U . By (5.8),\nH t (m) = K(u) + F (u\u2032 )\nwhere u\u2032 = b\u22121 (\u03c8tK )\u22121 (u). If H t (m) is \u01eb-close to max H, then u \u2208 N\u01ebK and\nu\u2032 \u2208 N\u01ebF , that is,\n(5.9)\n\nu \u2208 N\u01ebK \u2229 \u03c8tK (b(N\u01ebF )).\n\nBecause K = K \u25e6 \u03c8tK , The set N\u01ebK is preserved under \u03c8tK , so we can\nrewrite (5.9) as u \u2208 \u03c8tK (N\u01ebK \u2229 b(N\u01ebF )). But, by assumption, N\u01ebK \u2229 b(N\u01ebF ) is\nempty. So H t (m) cannot be \u01eb-close to max H, and again we conclude that\nH t (m) \u2264 max H \u2212 \u01eb. So H t (m) \u2264 max H \u2212 \u01eb for all m \u2208 M and for all t.\nSince H t is normalized, we conclude that the positive Hofer lengths satisfy\n\u0003\nl+ ({\u03c8tH }) \u2264 l+ ({\u03c8tH }) \u2212 \u01eb, as required.\nThe second, quantitative, part of Lemma 5.1 does not automatically extend to more than two summands.

Disjoining a family of discs\nThe purpose of this section is to prove the following quantitative result,\nwhich is later used in the proof of Theorem 3.1. Recall that a function from\na topological space X to a topological space Y is proper if the preimage of\nevery compact subset of Y is a compact subset of X.\nLemma 7.1. Let W be a symplectic manifold and N : W \u2192 [0, r) a proper\nfunction. Let A1 , A2 : [0, r) \u2192 R be smooth functions such that the set\nC := {x \u2208 [0, r) | A1 (x) \u2265 0 and A2 (x) \u2265 0}\nis compact.

The symplectic isotopy moves the w coordinate but\nit does not change the value of N (w). For a fixed value of N (w), the effect\nof the isotopy on the z coordinate is independent of the w coordinate.\n\u0001\nProof. The map (z, w) 7\u2192 \u03c0|z|2 , N (w) from C \u00d7 W to [0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, r) is\nproper, hence closed. So the image of the complement of U under this map\nis a closed subset of [0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, r). This image is disjoint from the compact\nset\n{(s, x) \u2208 [0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, r) | x \u2208 C and s \u2264 A1 (x) + A2 (x)}\nso it has a positive distance from this set.

We recall\nthe statement:\nLet (M, \u03c9) be a compact connected symplectic manifold with\na Hamiltonian circle action. Suppose that the momentum\nmap attains its maximum at an isolated fixed point and that\nat least one of the isotropy weights at that point has absolute\nvalue greater than one. Let d be a positive number that is\nsmaller than the gap between the two largest critical values of\nthe momentum map. Then the circle action can be deformed\nto a loop in Ham(M, \u03c9) whose Hofer length is smaller than\nthat of the original circle action by 2d/9.\nWe can choose the deformation such that the positive Hofer\nlength never exceeds the initial one and the negative Hofer\nlength remains constant. Specifically, let H denote the momentum map, let pmax denote the point where H attains its\nmaximum, let \u03b1 denote the gap between the two largest critical values of H, and consider the subset of M given by\n\n(8.1)\n\n{m | H(m) > H(pmax ) \u2212 \u03b1}.\n\n\f26\n\nY.

If one of\nthe isotropy weights is even then we can shorten by 14 d. Otherwise, let \u2212k1 be the weight whose absolute value is largest;\nthen we can shorten by 14 (1 \u2212 k12 )d. When k1 = 3, this becomes 92 d.\n\n1\n\nProof of Theorem 3.1 and Remarks 3.2 and 3.4. Let \u2212k1 , . . . , \u2212kn be the isotropy\nweights at pmax . The equivariant Darboux theorem implies that the integers\nkj are positive. We assume that at least one of them is greater than one.\nWithout loss of generality,\n(8.2)\n\nk1 = a + b\n\nwhere a and b are positive integers.\nThe point pmax is the only critical point of H in the set (8.1), and the\nmomentum map H is proper as a map from this set to the ray (H(pmax ) \u2212\n\u03b1, \u221e). There exists an equivariant symplectomorphism from the subset of\nCn given by\nN\u03b1H = {z | \u03c0(k1 |z1 |2 + . . . + kn |zn |2 ) < \u03b1},\nwith the circle action generated by the momentum map H(z1 , . . . , zn ) =\n\u2212k1 \u03c0|z1 |2 \u2212 . . . \u2212 kn |zn |2 to the subset (8.1) of M ; denote it\ni : N\u03b1H \u2192 M.\nThis follows from [9, Proposition 2.8] (which should have been stated with\n|zj |2 instead of the typo |zj |).\nLet\nN (z2 , . . . , zn ) := \u03c0(k2 |z2 |2 + . . . + kn |zn |2 ).\nWe will apply Lemma 5.1 with U = N\u03b1H ,\nK(z1 , . . . , zn ) := H(pmax ) \u2212 \u03c0b|z1 |2 ,\nand\nF (z1 , . . . , zn ) := \u2212\u03c0a|z1 |2 \u2212 N (z2 , . . . , zn ).\nLet 0 < d < \u03b1 and let s = 29 d.

Then ab/k12 = 1/4, which\nis greater than 2/9. If k1 is odd, write k1 = a + b where b = a + 1. Then\nab/k12 = 1/4(1 \u2212 1/k12 ) which, because k1 \u2265 3, is greater than or equal to\n1/4(1\u22121/9) = 2/9. In either case, if s = 2/9d and d < \u03b1, then s < (ab/k12 )\u03b1,\nwhich is equivalent to the required inequality.\n\u0003\n9. Symplectic vector bundles\nIn this section we apply the symplectic tubular neighbourhood theorem\nto describe a neighbourhood of a fixed component in a manifold with Hamiltonian circle action in terms of a symplectic vector bundle, and we give some\nresults about symplectic vector bundles that we will use in the next section.\nLemma 9.1. Let\n\u03c0: E \u2192 B\nbe a symplectic vector bundle, i.e., a vector bundle with a fibrewise symplectic\nform.

Let 2n = rankE, and let\nG = Sp(R2n )\nbe the group of symplectic linear transformations of R2n . Let P \u2192 B be the\nprincipal G bundle (with a right G action) whose fibre Eb over a point b of\nB consists of the set of linear symplectic isomorphisms from R2n to Eb .\nWe identify E with the associated bundle\nP \u00d7G R2n ,\nin which [pa, z] = [p, az] for all p \u2208 P , z \u2208 R2n , and a \u2208 G.\nLet \u0398 \u2208 \u03a91 (P, g) be a connection one-form; use the same symbol, \u0398, to\ndenote its pullback to P \u00d7 R2n . Let \u03c90 be the standard symplectic form on\nR2n . Let \u03a6R2n : R2n \u2192 g\u2217 be the quadratic momentum map for the G-action\non R2n . Let h*, *i denote the pairing between g\u2217 and g. Then h\u03a6R2n , \u0398i is a\nG-invariant real valued one-form on P \u00d7 R2n . The difference \u03c90 \u2212 d h\u03a6R2n , \u0398i\ndescends to a closed two-form \u03c9\u0398 on P \u00d7G R2n with the desired properties.\nIf a compact Lie group K acts on E by bundle automorphisms, then, by\naveraging, we can choose the connection one-form \u0398 to be K-invariant. The\nresulting two-form \u03c9\u0398 is then K-invariant.\n\u0003\nLet (B, \u03c9B ) be a symplectic manifold, let \u03c0 : E \u2192 B be a symplectic vector\nbundle, and let a compact Lie group K act on E by bundle automorphisms\nthat descend to symplectomorphisms of (B, \u03c9B ).

Let \u03c9E be an\ninvariant closed two-form on the total space of E whose pullback to the fibres\ncoincides with the fibrewise symplectic form. Let H : E \u2192 R be the fibrewise\nquadratic momentum map for the fibrewise circle action. Then H is also a\nmomentum map for the circle action on the total space (E, \u03c9E ).\nProof. Let \u03be denote the vector field that generates the circle action. The\none-form \u03b9(\u03be)\u03c9E is closed and vanishes on the zero section, so it is exact; so\nthere exists a momentum map\nHE : E \u2192 R\nfor the circle action on (E, \u03c9E ). (\u03c9E need not be nondegenerate.) Because\n\u03be = 0 along the zero section, HE is locally constant along the zero section.\nAdding a locally constant function, we may assume that HE vanishes along\nthe zero section. Because the pullback of \u03c9E to the fibres coincides with\nthe fibrewise symplectic form, the restriction of HE to each fibre is also\na momentum map for the fibrewise circle action; because it vanishes on\nthe zero section, it must coincide with the fibrewise quadratic momentum\nmap, H.\n\u0003\nNow let B be a connected component of the fixed point set of a circle\naction on a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9), and let E be the normal bundle\nof B in M . Then B is a symplectic submanifold, and E can be identified\nwith the symplectic orthocomplement of T B in T M |B . Moreover, the circle\naction on M induces a circle action on E by bundle automorphisms. Let \u03c9E\nbe an invariant coupling form on E, as described above. In this setting, we\nhave the following symplectic tubular neighbourhood theorem.\n\n(9.5)\n\nThere exists an invariant neighbourhood U of the zero section in E and an equivariant symplectic open embedding\n(U, \u03c9E ) \u2192 (M, \u03c9) whose restriction to the zero section is\nthe identity map on B and, under the natural identification\nof T E|B with T M |B , whose differential is the identity map\nat every point of B.\n\n(This follows from the classical tubular neighbourhood theorem in differential topology, combined with Theorem 4.1 of Alan Weinstein's paper [25],\nkeeping track of a group action as explained in the last paragraph of Section\n3 of [25].)\n\n\f30\n\nY. KARSHON AND J. SLIMOWITZ\n\nLemma 9.6. Let E \u2192 B be a symplectic vector bundle with a fibrewise\ncircle action. Suppose that all the weights are negative; denote the weights\nby \u2212k1 , . . . , \u2212ks and let\nk = min{k1 , . . . , ks } \u2212 1.\nThen there exist k+1 commuting fibrewise circle actions on E, with fibrewise\nquadratic momentum maps\nH(j) : E \u2192 R\n\n,\n\n0 \u2264 j \u2264 k,\n\nwith the following properties.\n(i) The Hj are are negative outside the zero section, and their sum\nH(0) + H(1) + . . . + H(k)\nis the fibrewise quadratic momentum map for the given circle action\non E.\n(ii) There exist arbitrarily small neighbourhoods U of the zero section\nthat are invariant under the k + 1 commuting fibrewise circle actions, whose intersections with the fibres of E are connected, and\nthat satisfy\n(9.7)\n\ninf\nU\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\nH(j) =\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\ninf H(j) .\nU\n\nRemark 9.8. This lemma is about fibrewise structures. It does not require\na two-form on the total space of E.\nProof. Fix an invariant fibrewise compatible complex structure and Hermitian metric on E. (Because the weights are all negative, such a metric is\nunique.) After eliminating repetitions, we may assume that the positive\nnumbers k1 , . . . , ks are distinct. Let Ej denote the \u2212kj th weight space for\nthe circle action on E, so that E decomposes as E1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Es . The function\nz 7\u2192 \u03c0kzj k2 ,\nfor z = (z1 , . . . , zs ) \u2208 E1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Es , is a momentum map for the scalar multiplication circle action on the Ej factor.

We get a decomposition of (9.9) into the\nsum\nH(0) + H(1) + . . . + H(k) ,\n\n\fSHORTENING HOFER LENGTH OF CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n31\n\nwhere\nH(i) (z) = \u2212ai1 \u03c0kz1 k2 \u2212 . . . \u2212 ais \u03c0kzs k2\ngenerates the fibrewise circle action on E that rotates the jth coordinate\nwith speed \u2212aij . Because the numbers aij are positive, the functions H(j)\nare negative outside the zero section.\nFinally, every neighbourhood of the zero section contains a neighbourhood\ns\nT\nof the form U =\n{z | \u03c0kzj k2 < \u01eb}, and such a U satisfies the requirements\nj=1\n\nof part (ii) of the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 9.10. Let (B, \u03c9B ) be a symplectic manifold, let E \u2192 B be a symplectic vector bundle, let \u03c9E be a coupling form (see (9.2)), and let U be\nan open subset of E where \u03c9E is non-degenerate. Let k be a positive integer. Suppose that there exist k sections of E that are nowhere all vanishing.\nThen there exist smooth functions g1 , . . . , gk : U \u2192 R whose Hamiltonian\nvector fields are nowhere all tangent to the zero section of E.\nProof. Let \u03be1 , . . . , \u03bek be sections of E \u2192 B that are nowhere all vanishing.\nFix j \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. Let gj : E \u2192 R be the function whose restriction to the\nfibre over b is the linear functional \u03b9(\u03bej (b))\u03c9Eb , where \u03c9Eb is the symplectic\nform on the fibre over b. Identifying E with the vertical subbundle of T E|B ,\nthe Hamiltonian vector field of gj |U is equal to \u03bej at the points of the zero\nsection. Because \u03be1 , . . . , \u03bek are vertical and nowhere all vanishing, they are\nnowhere all tangent to the zero section.\n\u0003\nRemark 9.11. Each of the following assumptions on an oriented vector bundle E \u2192 B implies that there exist k sections that are nowhere all vanishing.\nLet e(E) denote the Euler class of the bundle.\n(a) dim B < k rank E.\n(b) dim B = k rank E and e(E)k = 0.\n(c) rank E = 2, e(E) = 0, and k \u2265 1.\nProof. If dim B < k rank E then, for any generic choice of k sections of\nE, these sections are nowhere all vanishing. This gives (a). If the rank of a\nbundle is equal to the dimension of its base, or if the rank of a bundle is equal\nto 2, then the Euler class being zero implies the existence of a non-vanishing\nsection. Applying this to the bundle |E \u2295 .{z\n. . \u2295 E} gives (b); applying it to E\nk times\n\ngives (c).\n\n\u0003\n\nIn preparation for the proof of Theorem 3.9, which involves a subbundle of the normal bundle, we now give a refinement of the minimal coupling\n\n\f32\n\nY.

In it, we view\nE \u2032 as the subset of E consisting of the set of points whose fibrewise E \u2032\u2032\ncoordinate is zero, i.e., the preimage under p\u2032\u2032 of the zero section of E \u2032\u2032 .\nLemma 9.14. Let (B, \u03c9B ) be a symplectic manifold, let E \u2192 B be a symplectic vector bundle, and let E \u2032 and E \u2032\u2032 be symplectic sub-bundles such that\nE = E \u2032 \u2295 E \u2032\u2032 . Let \u03c9E \u2032 be a coupling form on E \u2032 and let \u03c9E be a coupling\nform on E that is compatible with \u03c9E \u2032 in the sense of (9.13). Let U \u2032 be a\nneighbourhood of the zero section in E \u2032 where \u03c9E \u2032 is non-degenerate, and let\nU be a neighbourhood of the zero section in E where \u03c9E is non-degenerate\nand that is contained in p\u2032 \u22121 (U \u2032 ).\nLet g1\u2032 , . . . , gk\u2032 : U \u2032 \u2192 R be smooth functions whose Hamiltonian vector\nfields in U \u2032 are nowhere all tangent to the zero section of E \u2032 . Let g1 , . . . , gk : U \u2192\nR be their pullbacks under p\u2032 |U : U \u2192 U \u2032 . Then, at each point of the zero\nsection of E, the Hamiltonian vector fields of g1 , . . . , gk are tangent to E \u2032\nand are not all tangent to the zero section of E.\nProof. Viewing E \u2032 as a subset of E (namely, the p\u2032\u2032 -preimage of the zero\nsection of E \u2032\u2032 ), for every point q \u2208 E \u2032 we have a natural decomposition\n(9.15)\n\nT E|q = T E \u2032 |q \u2295 E \u2032\u2032 |\u03c0(q) .\n\nLet \u03be1\u2032 , . . . , \u03bek\u2032 be the Hamiltonian vector fields of g1\u2032 , . . . , gk\u2032 in U \u2032 .

The vectors p\u2032\u2032 \u2217 \u03be \u0303\u2032 j are tangent to the zero section of E \u2032\u2032 , so they are in the\nnull space of \u03c9\u03b8\u2032\u2032 .

Let E \u2032\u2032 be the fibrewise symplectic orthocomplement\nof E \u2032 in E, so E = E \u2032 \u2295 E \u2032\u2032 . Apply Lemma 9.16 to obtain k\u2032 + 1 commuting\nfibrewise circle actions on E, with fibrewise quadratic momentum maps\n\u2032\nH(j)\n:E\u2192R ,\n\n0 \u2264 j \u2264 k\u2032\n\n\u2032\nsuch that H(0)\nvanishes on the zero section of E and is negative outside it,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 +\nH(1) , . . . , H(k\u2032 ) vanish on E \u2032\u2032 and are negative outside it, the sum H(0)\n\u2032 + . . . + H\u2032\nH(1)\n(k \u2032 ) is the fibrewise quadratic momentum map for the given\ncircle action on E, and part (ii) of Lemma 9.16 holds (with \"k\" and \"H(j) \"\n\u2032 \").\nreplaced by \"k\u2032 \" and \"H(j)\nThese k\u2032 +1 circle actions, together with the given circle actions on E \u2032 and\non E \u2032\u2032 , fit together into a fibrewise action of a torus T . Apply Lemma 9.1 and\nEquations (9.2) and (9.13) to obtain T invariant coupling forms \u03c9E \u2032 on E \u2032\nand \u03c9E on E. Consider the given circle action on M and the induced circle\naction on E, and apply the symplectic tubular neighbourhood theorem (9.5)\nto obtain an invariant neighbourhood U of the zero section in E on which\n\u03c9E is nondegenerate and an equivariant symplectic open embedding\n\ni : (U, \u03c9E ) \u2192 (M, \u03c9)\nwhose restriction to the zero section is the identity map on Bmax and, under\nthe natural identification of T E|Bmax with T M |Bmax , whose differential is the\nidentity map at every point of Bmax .\nFix a positive number, \u03b1 > 0. After possibly shrinking U , we may assume\nthat i(U ) \u2282 {m \u2208 M | H(m) > H(Bmax ) \u2212 \u03b1} and that U satisfies the\nrequirements in part (ii) of Lemma 9.16: U is T invariant, the intersections\nof U with the fibres of E are connected, and\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ninf\nU\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\n\u2032\nH(j)\n\n=\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\n\u2032\ninf H(j)\n.\nU\n\nLet H : M \u2192 R denote the momentum map on M .

In this neighbourhood, the left and\nright hand sides of (10.3) are momentum maps for the same circle action\nwith the same value at the origin, so they are equal.)\nBecause the T action on E preserves \u03c9E and by Lemma 9.4, the maps\n\u2032\n\u2032 , . . ., H \u2032\n\u2032\nH(0) , H(1)\n(k \u2032 ) are momentum maps for the k + 1 commuting circle\nactions on the total space (E, \u03c9E ) and not only fibrewise. So H(0) , H(1) , . . .,\nH(k\u2032 ) generate commuting circle actions on (U, \u03c9E ).\n(0)\n\nWe are now in the setup of Lemma 5.10. The set Bmax where H(0) attains\n(j)\n\nits maximum is equal to the zero section, and, for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k\u2032 , the set Bmax\nwhere H(j) attains its maximum is the intersection of U with the image\nof E \u2032\u2032 in E. Slightly abusing notation, we write these sets as Bmax and\nas E \u2032\u2032 \u2229 U . To apply Lemma 5.10, we need to find symplectomorphisms\nb1 , . . . , bk\u2032 of U , each connected to the identity through a path of compactly\nsupported symplectomorphisms of U , such that\n(10.4)\n\nBmax \u2229 b1 (E \u2032\u2032 \u2229 U ) \u2229 . . . \u2229 bk\u2032 (E \u2032\u2032 \u2229 U ) = \u2205.\n\nLet U \u2032 be a neighbourhood of the zero section in E \u2032 where \u03c9E \u2032 is nondegenerate. By Lemma 9.10, there exist functions g1\u2032 , . . . , gk\u2032 \u2032 on U \u2032 whose\nHamiltonian vector fields are nowhere all tangent to the zero section of E \u2032 .\nFor j = 1, . . . , k \u2032 , let gj = \u03c1(gj\u2032 \u25e6 p\u2032 ) where p\u2032 : E \u2192 E \u2032 is the projection\nmap and where \u03c1 : U \u2192 R is a cutoff function that is equal to 1 near the\nzero section of E and has compact support in U . Lemma 9.14 implies that,\nat each point of Bmax , the Hamiltonian vector fields of g1 , . . . , gk\u2032 are tang\ngent to E \u2032 and are not all tangent to Bmax . Let \u03c8tg1 , . . . , \u03c8t k\u2032 be the corresponding flows. If t is a sufficiently small positive number, the intersecg\ntion Bmax \u2229 \u03c8tg1 (E \u2032\u2032 \u2229 U ) \u2229 . . . \u2229 \u03c8t k\u2032 (E \u2032\u2032 \u2229 U ) is empty. Lemma 5.10, with\ng\nb1 , . . . , bk\u2032 taken to be \u03c8tg1 , . . . , \u03c8t k\u2032 , gives the result of Theorem 3.9 and\nRemark 3.11.\n\u0003\n11. The index of the positive Hofer length functional\nIn this section we prove Theorem 3.17 and Remark 3.18. We recall the\nstatement, with slight change of notation (HM instead of H):\nLet (M, \u03c9) be a 2n dimensional compact connected manifold\nwith a Hamiltonian circle action. Suppose that the momentum map attains its maximum at an isolated fixed point.\nLet \u2212k1 , . . . , \u2212kn be the isotropy weights at the maximum,\nwith possible repetitions. Then there exists a neighbourhood\n\n\fSHORTENING HOFER LENGTH OF CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n39\n\nP\n\nD of the origin in R 2(kj \u22121) , and, for each \u03bb \u2208 D, a loop\n(\u03bb)\n{\u03c8t }0\u2264t\u22641 in Ham(M, \u03c9), such that the following proper(0)\nties hold. For \u03bb = 0, the loop {\u03c8t }0\u2264t\u22641 is the given circle\n(\u03bb)\naction. The function \u03bb 7\u2192 length({\u03c8t }) is smooth, \u03bb = 0\nis a critical point of this function, and the Hessian of this\nfunction at \u03bb = 0 is negative definite.\nIn fact, we can choose the deformation such that the negative Hofer length remains constant. Specifically, let HM\ndenote the momentum map, and let pmax denote the point\nwhere HM attains its maximum. For every positive number\n\u03b1, we can choose the deformation such that the normalized\ndeformed Hamiltonian remains between HM (pmax ) \u2212 \u03b1 and\nHM (pmax ) on the set {m \u2208 M | HM (m) > HM (pmax ) \u2212 \u03b1}\nand coincides with HM outside this set.\nProof of Theorem 3.17 and Remark 3.18. We set the following notation.\n\u03c6t : C \u2192 C ,\n\n\u03c6t (z) = e\u22122\u03c0it z\n\nfor t \u2208 R.\n\n\u03b2\u03bb : C \u2192 C , \u03b2\u03bb (z) = z + \u03bb for \u03bb \u2208 C.\nLet pmax denote the point where the momentum map HM attains its\nmaximum. By the equivariant Darboux theorem, near pmax , we can identify\nthe manifold with Cn , the action with the product action\n(\u03c6k1 t ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 (\u03c6kn t ),\n\n(11.1)\n\nand the momentum map with the function\nz 7\u2192 HM (pmax ) \u2212 N (z),\nwhere\n\u0001\nN (z) = \u03c0 k1 |z1 |2 + . . . + kn |zn |2 .\n\n(11.2)\n\n(We will use variants of the symbol N to denote variations and combinations of norm-square functions, and we will use variants of the symbol H to\ndenote momentum maps.)\nIf k is an integer greater than 1, the non-effective circle action \u03c6kt on C\nhas the deformation\n(11.3)\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n\u03c6t\n\n:= \u03c6t \u25e6 \u03b2\u03bbk\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c6t \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b2\u03bb2 \u25e6 \u03c6t \u25e6 \u03b2\u03bb1 \u25e6 \u03c6t \u25e6 \u03b2\u2212\u03bb1 \u2212...\u2212\u03bbk\u22121 ,\n\nparametrized by (\u03bb) = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk\u22121 ) \u2208 Ck\u22121 and generated by\n(\u03bb)\n\n(11.4) H t\n\n\u03c6\u22121 + . . .\n\u03c6\u22121 \u03b2\u03bb\u22121\n\u03c6\u22121 + H\u03b2\u03bb\u22121\n:= H + H\u03b2\u03bb\u22121\nk\u22121 t\nk\u22122 t\nk\u22121 t\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u03c6\u22121\n. . . + H\u03b2\u03bb\u22121\nt \u03b2\u03bb2 \u03c6t * * * \u03b2\u03bbk\u22121 \u03c6t ,\n1\n\n\f40\n\nY.

We give the details later.\nWe now turn to the relevant computation on Cn .

We will show that this function is quadratic in the real and imaginary parts of \u03bb, and that it is strictly negative\nwhen \u03bb 6= 0. This will imply that the function is smooth and that its Hessian\nat the origin is negative definite, as required.\nBy (11.6), it is enough to consider separately each of the functions (\u03bb)i 7\u2192\nR1\n(\u03bb)i\ndt.
