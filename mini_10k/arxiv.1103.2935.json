But many dynamical systems of\ninterest in physics and engineering applications are more specialized than that: they are\nof second-order type. By a dynamical system, or vector field, of second-order type, or a\nsecond-order differential equation field, we mean a vector field \u0393 on the tangent bundle\n\u03c4 : T (Q) \u2192 Q of some configuration manifold Q with the property that \u03c4\u2217y \u0393 = y for all\ny \u2208 T (Q), so that in terms of coordinates (xi , y i ) where the y i are the canonical fibre\ncoordinates corresponding to coordinates xi on Q,\n\u0393 = yi\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u0393i (x, y) i .\n\u2202xi\n\u2202y\n\nIt is of interest therefore, to find criteria for determining whether a given dynamical\nsystem, which may be represented in some arbitrary coordinates, is actually of secondorder type, in that coordinates may be found with respect to which it takes the form\nabove. This is a problem which has both a local aspect, just described, and a global one,\n1\n\n\fwhich includes the question of whether the manifold on which the dynamical system\nresides is in fact a tangent bundle.\nIn the recent article [11], Ricardo and Respondek deal with a version of the problem in\nthe context of control theory. Assume M to be an even dimensional manifold, not known\nto be the tangent manifold of some configuration manifold. Under which conditions does\na coordinate change exist such that a given nonlinear control system\n\u017c \u03b1 = F \u03b1 (z) + ur G\u03b1r (z),\n\n\u03b1 = 1, . . . , 2n,\n\nis transformed into the form of a so-called 'mechanical control system', meaning a dynamical system of the form\na\nq\u0308 a = \u0393bc\n(q)q\u0307 b q\u0307 c + Pba (q)q\u0307 b + Qa (q) + ur gra (z),\n\na = 1, . . . , n?\n\nThe solution of the problem in [11] is cast in terms of a certain vector space V, which is\na subspace of the infinite dimensional vector space of vector fields on M , with dimension\nexactly the half of the dimension of the manifold, and which, among other properties,\ncontains the control forces Gr and satisfies [V, V] = 0.\nIn this paper, we will address a more general problem. First of all, we will not assume\nthat the dimension of the manifold is even. This is mainly motivated by the observation\nthat even for a system of time-dependent second-order differential equations the manifold\non which the dynamics is described is odd-dimensional: it is the first jet manifold of a\nspacetime manifold, or event space, fibred over the real numbers (see e.g. [3, 7]). Further,\nwe will allow some of the new coordinates to play simply the role of parameters. That\nis to say, we will not require the number n of second-order equations to be exactly the\nhalf of the dimension of the manifold M .\nNext to extending the results of [11] to a broader class of manifolds, we will also make\nsome conceptual modifications. In a nutshell, the results of [11] claim that if V (which is\na vector space constructed from the given control forces Gr and from F ) satisfies certain\nconditions the vector field F = F \u03b1 \u2202/\u2202z \u03b1 (the so-called drift vector field) transforms\ninto an appropriate coordinate form, and, as a side-effect, so does also the controlled\ndynamical field F + ur Gr . We will take the space V to be the primary given object of our\nstudy, and ignore that it was constructed from some given control forces. Consequently,\nwe shift the attention to specific coordinate expressions for F , and leave the control\nsystem given by the vector field F + ur Gr out of the picture all together. A second\ndeviation is that for us V will not be a vector space of vector fields, but rather the\ndistribution it generates.\nIn Section 2 we investigate under what conditions a given vector field F can be transformed into the coordinate expression of a second-order differential equation field with\npossible parameters, in the presence of an arbitrary involutive distribution V (of arbitrary dimension). Our framework has the advantage that it leaves open the possibility\nthat the transformed dynamics become either autonomous or time-dependent. We show\nin Section 3 how one can associate various connections to F , and we argue that these\n2\n\n\fconnections provide a coordinate-independent method to express that the dynamics of\nF is of quadratic type (or of mechanical type, in the sense as above) in a yet unknown\nset of coordinates.\nWorking with a distribution V has the further advantage that it brings an associated\nalmost tangent structure (and almost jet structure) to the foreground. These geometric\nstructures find their equivalence in standard tangent bundle and jet bundle geometry,\nbut they went unnoticed in [11]. Based on results in [4, 5, 10] we further address in\nSection 4 the global issues that arise in this context, such as e.g. the affine fibre bundle\nstructure of M and the relation of F to second-order differential equation fields on a\ncertain tangent or jet manifold.\nIn the last section we illustrate the theory in the context of a Lagrangian system with an\nAbelian symmetry group, where a second-order differential equation field with multiple\nparameters naturally shows up.\n\n2\n\nLocal coordinate transformations\n\nLet M be a manifold of dimension m and V an involutive distribution on M of dimension\nn such that 2n \u2264 m.\nWe must be a little careful here about the meaning of the term distribution and related\nterms. A distribution on M is of course a choice of subspace of Tz (M ) at each z \u2208 M , of\nconstant dimension, depending smoothly on z in the sense that it admits local smooth\nbases. There is a related, but distinct, concept, which we may call a vector field system.\nA vector field system S on M is a collection of (smooth) vector fields on M which is a\nC \u221e (M ) submodule of X(M ), the module of vector fields on M . For each z \u2208 M , we\ndenote by dimz (S) the dimension of the subspace of Tz (M ) spanned by the values at z\nof the vector fields in S. Now dimz (S) need not be constant. However, if vector fields\nXa are linearly independent at z they are linearly independent in a neighbourhood of\nz, which means that dimz \u2032 (S) \u2265 dimz (S) for all z \u2032 in a neighbourhood of z. Moreover,\ndimz (S) has a maximal value on M , which we call the maximal dimension of S, and the\nset of points at which the maximal dimension is attained is an open subset of M .\nA vector field system S on M restricts to a vector field system S|U on any open subset\nU of M , considered as a submanifold. On the other hand, any vector field in SU may be\nextended to a vector field in S by multiplying it by a bump function whose support is\ncontained in U (taking advantage of the fact that we are working in the C \u221e category).\nSo it is permissible to discuss local aspects of vector field systems in coordinates.\nAn alternative definition of the term distribution is that a distribution is a vector field\nsystem S for which dimz (S) is constant, or for which the maximal dimension is attained\neverywhere.\nWe assume that V, mentioned in the opening sentence of the section, is a distribution in\n3\n\n\fthe strict sense. Now suppose that we have a vector field F on M not belonging to V.\nWe denote by V + [F, V] the collection of vector fields on M which may be written in the\nform V1 + [F, V2 ] with V1 , V2 \u2208 V. This is a vector field system, essentially because for\nany f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) and V \u2208 V, f [F, V ] = [F, f V ] (mod V). We will be concerned with this\nvector field system, for a given involutive distribution V and vector field F , throughout\nthis paper.\nProposition 1. Suppose that the vector field F is such that [F, V] \u2229 V = {0}, that is, if\nV \u2208 V and [F, V ] \u2208 V then V = 0. Then the maximal dimension of V + [F, V] is 2n, and\nthe open subset of M on which it is attained is dense, that is, its closure is M .\nProof. We denote the vector field system V + [F, V] by W for convenience. Clearly the\nmaximal dimension of W is at most 2n, and the set of points z where dimz (W) = 2n is\nopen, though it may be empty. Suppose that z is a point of M with dimz (W) < 2n. We\nshow that there can be no open neighbourhood of z such that dimz \u2032 (W) < 2n for all z \u2032\nin the neighbourhood.\nSince V is involutive there is a coordinate neighbourhood U of z and coordinates (q a , y i )\nwith a = 1, 2, . . . , m \u2212 n and i = 1, 2, . . . , n such that the coordinate fields \u2202/\u2202y i span\nV|U . We may set\n\u2202\n\u2202\nF |U = f a a + f i i\n\u2202q\n\u2202y\nfor some smooth functions f a , f i on U , so that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\n\u2202f a \u2202\nF |U , i = \u2212 i a\n\u2202y\n\u2202y \u2202q\n\n(mod V),\n\nand for any V \u2208 VU , with V = V i \u2202/\u2202y i ,\n[F |U , V ] = \u2212V i\n\n\u2202f a \u2202\n\u2202y i \u2202q a\n\n(mod V).\n\nNow since m \u2212 n \u2265 n the rank of the matrix (\u2202f a /\u2202y i ) at any point is at most n. If it\nis n at z then\n\u2202f a\nV i (z) i (z) = 0 =\u21d2 V i (z) = 0,\n\u2202y\nthe vector fields [F |U , \u2202/\u2202y i ] are linearly independent at z, and dimz (W) = 2n. So if\ndimz \u2032 (W) < 2n for all z \u2032 in a neighbourhood of z, which we can take to be a coordinate\nneighbourhood as above, then the rank of the matrix (\u2202f a /\u2202y i )(z \u2032 ) is less than n, and\nwe can find functions V i on a neighbourhood U of z, not all vanishing, such that\nVi\n\n\u2202f a\n= 0.\n\u2202y i\n\nThen the vector field V = V i \u2202/\u2202y i on U satisfies [F |U , V ] \u2208 V. So (by multiplying by\na suitable bump function) we can find a vector field V \u2032 on M , not identically zero, with\n4\n\n\fV \u2032 \u2208 V, such that [F, V \u2032 ] \u2208 V, which is a contradiction. So every neighbourhood of a\npoint z where dimz (W) < 2n must contain a point z \u2032 where dimz \u2032 (W) = 2n. Thus the\nset of points z where dimz (W) = 2n is nonempty and open, and its closure is M ; that\nis, the set of points where dimz (W) = 2n is an open dense subset of M .\nFrom now on we will assume that the vector field F does indeed satisfy the condition of\nProposition 1, and we will restrict our attention to the open subset where dimz (W) = 2n,\nthat is to say, we will effectively assume that W is a distribution. We will make the further\nassumption that the distribution W is also involutive.\nWe will work locally for the rest of this section, and drop explicit notational reference to\nthe neighbourhood on which we are working.\nIn the proof of Proposition 1 we showed that if {Vi } is a local basis of V consisting of\ncoordinate fields \u2202/\u2202y i of a local coordinate system (q a , y i ) and we set Wi = [F, Vi ] then\n{Vi , Wi } is a local basis for W. Indeed, this will be true for any local basis {Vi } of V.\nIf we change basis to \u1e7ci = Aji Vj (where the Aji are locally defined smooth functions and\n(Aji ) is nonsingular) then Wi changes to W\u0303i = Aji Wj + F (Aji )Vj . If the basis {Vi } is\nsuch that [Vi , Vj ] = 0, so that the Vi are coordinate fields, the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for {\u1e7ci } also to satisfy [\u1e7ci , \u1e7cj ] = 0 is that Ali Vl (Akj ) = Alj Vl (Aki ).\nOur next aim is to show that, under the assumptions stated earlier, one can choose a\ncommuting basis {Vi } for V such that it and the corresponding Wi satisfy [Vi , Wj ] \u2208 V.\nFor any basis {Vi } we can write\nk\n[Vi , Wj ] = \u03b1kij Vk + \u03b2ij\nWk .\n\nNotice that if [Vi , Vj ] = 0 then both coefficients are symmetric in their lower indices:\n0 = [F, [Vi , Vj ]] = [Wi , Vj ] + [Vi , Wj ] = [Vi , Wj ] \u2212 [Vj , Wi ].\nIf we change the basis of V to \u1e7ci = Aji Vj we have\n[\u1e7ci , W\u0303j ] = [Aki Vk , Alj Wl + F (Alj )Vl ]\nk\n= (Ali Vl (Akj ) + Ali Am\nj \u03b2lm )Wk\n\n(mod V).\n\nk\nSo to make [\u1e7ci , W\u0303j ] \u2208 V we want to choose Aji such that Vl (Akj ) + Am\nj \u03b2lm = 0. Note that\nk is symmetric, we will then have Al V (Ak ) = Al V (Ak ), and if the V pairwise\nsince \u03b2ij\ni\ni l\nj\nj l\ni\ncommute then the \u1e7ci will also pairwise commute.\n\nThe equations\n\u2202Akj\nk\n+ Am\nj \u03b2lm = 0\n\u2202y l\nare linear first-order partial differential equations for the unknowns Aij , and admit solutions if and only if their integrability conditions, which are\nl\n\u2202\u03b2jk\n\n\u2202y i\n\n\u2212\n\nl\n\u2202\u03b2ik\nl\nm\nl\nm\n+ \u03b2im\n\u03b2jk\n\u2212 \u03b2jm\n\u03b2ik\n= 0,\n\u2202y j\n\n5\n\n\fare satisfied. Now\n0 = [[Vi , Vj ], Wk ] = [[Vi , Wk ], Vj ] + [Vi , [Vj , Wk ]],\nand\nl\nm\nl\n)Wl\n) + \u03b2im\n\u03b2jk\n[Vi , [Vj , Wk ]] = (Vi (\u03b2jk\n\n(mod V).\n\nSo it follows from the identity [Vi , [Vj , Wk ]] \u2212 [Vj , [Vi , Wk ]] = 0 that the integrability\nconditions are indeed satisfied. If we take a solution Aij for which the matrix (Aij ) is\nnonsingular on a local cross-section of the V foliation, for example by taking Aij = \u03b4ji\nthere, then (Aij ) will be nonsingular on an open subset containing the cross-section. We\nhave shown the following.\nProposition 2. If both V and W are involutive, there is a commuting basis {Vi } of V\nsuch that for all i, j, [Vi , Wj ] \u2208 V (where Wi = [F, Vi ]).\nThe remaining freedom in the choice of commuting basis (such that [Vi , Wj ] \u2208 V still\nholds) is to take Aji to satisfy Vk (Aji ) = 0.\nThe condition [Vi , Wj ] \u2208 V says that Wj is invariant under the action of V, modulo V.\nLet us take a coordinate neighbourhood U in M , with coordinates (q a , y i ) such that\nVi = \u2202/\u2202y i ; we may suppose without essential loss of generality that U is the image\nof a product of open subsets O \u2282 Rm\u2212n and P \u2282 Rn , where 0 \u2208 P . Then y i = 0 is\na submanifold of U of codimension n, say N , and U is fibered over N with fibres the\nintegral submanifolds of V. Denote by \u03c0 : U \u2192 N the corresponding projection. Then\nthe restriction of Wj to U is projectable to N : that is to say, there is a well-defined\nvector field W\u0304j on N which is \u03c0-related to Wj . More generally, a vector field X \u2208 W, say\nX = X i Wi (mod V), is projectable if, and only if, the coefficients X i satisfy V (X i ) = 0\nfor all V \u2208 V, or indeed if Vj (X i ) = 0. Let us denote by W\u0304 the distribution on N spanned\nby the W\u0304i , in other words, the distribution consisting of the projections of projectable\nvector fields in W. Then W\u0304 is involutive, since it \u03c0-related to the involutive distribution\nW. We may therefore choose coordinates (tp , xi ) on N , where p = 1, 2, . . . , m \u2212 2n, such\nthat the integral submanifolds of W\u0304 are given by tp = constant. Then with respect to\nthe coordinates (tp , xi , y i ) on U we have\nVi =\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202y i\n\nWi = Wij (x)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xj\n\n(mod V),\n\nwhere the coefficients Wij are everywhere the components of a nonsingular matrix. We\nstill have at our disposal the freedom to change the original basis to \u1e7ci = Aji (t, x)Vj . If\nwe do so with Aki Wkj = \u03b4ij then\n\u1e7ci = Aji\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202y j\n\nW\u0303i =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n\n(mod V).\n\nIf we make a further change of coordinates to\nt\u0303p = tp ,\n\nx\u0303i = \u2212xi ,\n6\n\n\u1ef9 i = Wji (x)y j ,\n\n\fthen\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= p (mod V),\n=\u2212 i\n\u2202t\n\u2202 x\u0303i\n\u2202x\n\u2202 t\u0303p\nWe have proved the following result.\n\n(mod V),\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= Aji j\n\u2202 \u1ef9 i\n\u2202y\n\nProposition 3. With V, W, Vi , Wi as above, we can find local coordinates (tp , xi , y i )\non M , p = 1, 2, . . . , m \u2212 2n, i = 1, 2, . . . , n such that\nVi =\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202y i\n\nWi = \u2212\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n\n(mod V).\n\nWe move on now to investigate the form of F . There are two cases to consider, depending\non whether F does or does not belong to W.\nTheorem 1. Assume both V and W are involutive.\n1. Suppose that F \u2208 W, and assume that the set N \u2282 M = {z \u2208 M : F (z) \u2208 V} is\nnonempty. Then we may choose coordinates with respect to which\nF = yi\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ F i (t, x, y) i ;\n\u2202xi\n\u2202y\n\nthat is to say, F takes the form of a second-order differential equation field in terms\nof the coordinates (xi , y i ), with the tp merely behaving as parameters.\n2. Suppose that F is everywhere independent of W (so that in particular M > 2n)\nand that [F, W] \u2282 W. Then we may choose coordinates with respect to which\nF =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ y i i + F i (t, x, y) i ;\n1\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\nthat is to say, F takes the form of a time-dependent second-order differential equation field in terms of the coordinates (t1 , xi , y i ), with the tp with p > 1 merely\nbehaving as parameters.\nProof. 1. For the first case, set F = ai Vi + bi Wi with respect to a frame with [Vi , Vj ] = 0\nand [Vi , Wj ] \u2208 V. Then\nWi = [F, Vi ] = \u2212Vi (aj )Vj + bj [Wj , Vi ] \u2212 Vi (bj )Wj ,\nso we must have Vi (bj ) = \u2212\u03b4ij . Now N is the zero level set of (bi ), and the rank of the\nJacobian of the map M \u2192 Rn : z 7\u2192 (bi (z)) is n, or in other words the 1-forms dbi are\nindependent, since (Vi (bj )) is nonsingular. So N is an immersed submanifold of M of\ncodimension n, and V is transverse to it. We may choose coordinates (tp , xi , y i ) as in\nProposition 3, such that Vi = \u2202/\u2202y i , N is given by y i = 0, (tp , xi ) are coordinates on N ,\nand\n\u2202\nWi = \u2212 i (mod V).\n\u2202x\n7\n\n\fWith respect to such coordinates set\nF = f i (t, x, y)\nThen from its definition\nWi = \u2212\nand therefore\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ F i (t, x, y) i .\ni\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n\u2202f j \u2202\n\u2202y i \u2202xj\n\n(mod V),\n\n\u2202f j\n= \u03b4ij .\n\u2202y i\n\nTaking into account the fact that f i (t, x, 0) = 0 we have f i (t, x, y) = y i .\n2. For the second case, take coordinates as in Proposition 3, and suppose that\n\u2202\n(mod W).\n\u2202tp\nFrom the assumption that [F, W] \u2282 W it follows that in fact \u03c6p depends only on the tq .\nBy assumption the \u03c6p cannot vanish simultaneously, and so by a transformation of the\ncoordinates tp we may take\nF = \u03c6p (t, x, y)\n\nF =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ f i (t, x, y) i + F i (t, x, y) i .\n1\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\nArguing as above we see that\n\n\u2202f j\n= \u03b4ij .\n\u2202y i\n\nWe may only conclude now that f i (t, x, y) = y i + ki (t, x). However, a further coordinate\ntransformation y i 7\u2192 y i + ki (t, x), with tp and xi unchanged, leads to\n\u2202\n\u2202\n7\u2192 p\np\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n7\u2192\ni\n\u2202x\n\u2202xi\n\n(mod V),\n\n(mod V),\n\nwith \u2202/\u2202y i unchanged, and so leads to the required form for F .\nThe remaining freedom in transforming the coordinates (xi , y i ) in the first case, so as to\npreserve the form of F , is\n\u2202 x\u0303i j\ny .\nx\u0303i = x\u0303i (x), \u1ef9 i =\n\u2202xj\nThat is to say, the y i transform like canonical fibre coordinates on a tangent bundle.\nFrom this point of view it is natural to think of the coordinates y i in use before the final\ntransformation leading to Proposition 3 as quasi-velocities.\nThe remaining freedom in the second case is\nx\u0303i = x\u0303i (t1 , x),\n\n\u1ef9 i =\n\n\u2202 x\u0303i j \u2202xi\ny + 1.\n\u2202xj\n\u2202t\n\nHere the y i transform like the jet coordinates of the 1-jet bundle of a manifold fibred\nover R.\n8\n\n\f3\n\nInduced connections\n\nk used in the proof of Proposition 2 have the appearance of the compoThe coefficients \u03b2ij\nnents of a connection, and the integrability conditions quoted in the proof have the form\nof the vanishing of the curvature of this connection. We begin this section by explaining\nk are indeed the components of a flat symmetric connection.\nin what sense the \u03b2ij\n\nLet V be an involutive distribution on any manifold M . For any vector field X on M\ndenote by X + V the equivalence class of X modulo V, that is, the collection of vector\nfields differing from X by an element of V. For any V \u2208 V, set\nDV (X + V) = [V, X] + V.\nThis is a well-defined operator on equivalence classes, which is R-linear in both arguments, and for f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) satisfies\nDf V (X + V) = f DV (X + V),\n\nDV (f X + V) = f DV (X + V) + V (f )(X + V).\n\nThat is to say, D has connection-like properties. By the Jacobi identity, for any V1 , V2 \u2208 V\nDV1 DV2 (X + V) \u2212 DV2 DV1 (X + V) \u2212 D[V1 ,V2 ] (X + V) = 0;\nthat is to say, if D were a connection it would have zero curvature.\nMore particularly, let W be another involutive distribution on M , with V \u2282 W; then\nwe may restrict X in the construction above to lie in W. The same conclusions hold,\nmutatis mutandis. We may think of V and W as vector sub-bundles of T (M ), and vector\nfields in the distributions as sections of the corresponding bundles V \u2192 M , W \u2192 M . If\nW is a section of W \u2192 M then we may think of W + V as a section of the vector bundle\nW/V \u2192 M . Then (using the terminology of Lie algebroid theory) D is a V-connection\non W/V.\nNow take dim W = 2n, dim V = n, and suppose there is a type (1, 1) tensor field S on W\n(that is, a section of the bundle W \u2297W \u2217 \u2192 M ) with the algebraic properties of an almost\ntangent structure (so that im S = ker S), with kernel V. Then S defines an isomorphism\nbetween sections of W/V and sections of V. So we may define a V-connection on V, say\n\u2207, by\n\u2207V1 V2 = S(DV1 (W + V)) for any W \u2208 W such that S(W ) = V2 .\nThat is, \u2207V S(W ) = S(DV (W + V)) = S([V, W ]). This is well-defined as a V-connection,\nand has vanishing curvature. Since \u2207 is a V-connection on V, it makes sense to talk\nabout its torsion. But for any W1 , W2 \u2208 W,\n\u2207S(W1 ) S(W2 ) \u2212 \u2207S(W2 ) S(W1 ) \u2212 [S(W1 ), S(W2 )]\n= S[S(W1 ), W2 ] \u2212 S[S(W2 ), W1 ] \u2212 [S(W1 ), S(W2 )]\n= \u2212([S(W1 ), S(W2 )] \u2212 S[S(W1 ), W2 ] \u2212 S[W1 , S(W2 )])\n= \u2212NS (W1 , W2 ).\n9\n\n\fThat is to say, the torsion vanishes if and only if the formal Nijenhuis torsion NS of S\n(a type (2, 1) W-tensor) vanishes.\nIf S has vanishing Nijenhuis torsion in this sense, and we restrict attention to any leaf\nof the involutive distribution V, we obtain a flat symmetric connection there.\nWe now show how to construct such a W-tensor S in the case of interest.\nProposition 4. Assume both V and W are involutive. There is a unique type (1, 1)\nW-tensor field S for which\nS(V ) = 0\n\nand\n\nS([F, V ]) = \u2212V,\n\nV \u2208 V;\n\nit satisfies ker S = im S = V and NS = 0.\nProof. Let {Vi } be a basis of V, and set Wi = [F, Vi ]: then {Vi , Wi } is a basis for W. So it\nis enough to know how S acts on elements of the form V and [F, V ]. The definition above\nis consistent: if V \u2208 V, then also f V \u2208 V with f a function on M , and S([F, f V ]) =\nS(F (f )V ) + S(f [F, V ]) = f S([F, V ]) = \u2212f V . We have S 2 = 0, ker S = im S = V. The\nformal Nijenhuis torsion NS obviously vanishes for two elements in V. Moreover, for any\nV1 , V2 \u2208 V,\nNS (V1 , [F, V2 ]) = \u2212S[V1 , V2 ] = 0\nbecause of the assumed integrability of V. Likewise, by making use of the Jacobi identity\n(and because [V1 , V2 ] \u2208 V),\nNS ([F, V1 ], [F, V2 ]) = [V1 , V2 ] + S[V1 , [F, V2 ]] + S[[F, V1 ], V2 ]\n= [V1 , V2 ] + S[F, [V1 , V2 ]] = 0.\nk are the connection coefficients\nIn the case of interest, where S is as defined above, the \u03b2ij\nof this connection with respect to the basis {Vi }.\n\nSuppose we have a further distribution H on M , of dimension n, contained in W, and\neverywhere transverse to V; in other words a complement to V in W. We call such a\ndistribution horizontal. Then the restriction of S to H is a C \u221e (M )-isomorphism H \u2192 V.\nFor any V \u2208 V, denote by V H the unique element of H such that S(V H ) = V .\nWe can extend the V-connection \u2207 on V to a W-connection on V as follows: for any\nW \u2208 W and any V \u2208 V set\n\u2207W V = PV ([PH (W ), V ]) + S([PV (W ), V H ]),\nwhere PH and PV are the projectors on H and V, respectively. The right-hand side\nbelongs to V and depends R-linearly on the arguments. For f \u2208 C \u221e (M )\n\u2207f W V = PV ([f PH (W ), V ]) + S([f PV (W ), V H ])\n= f \u2207W V \u2212 V (f )PV (PH (W )) \u2212 V H (f )S(PV (W ))\n= f \u2207W V\n10\n\n\fwhile\n\u2207W (f V ) = PV ([PH (W ), f V ]) + S([PV (W ), f V H ])\n= f \u2207W V + PH (W )(f )PV (V ) + PV (W )(f )S(V H )\n= f \u2207W V + (PH (W ) + PV (W ))(f )V\n= f \u2207W V + W (f )V.\nSo \u2207 is a covariant derivative.\nIf W \u2208 V, say W = V1 , then the new definition gives \u2207V1 V2 = S([V1 , V2H ]). According\nto the old definition, \u2207V1 V2 = S([V1 , W ]) for any W such that S(W ) = V2 . But W =\nV2H is such that S(W ) = V2 ; so the two definitions agree in this case. On the other\nhand, suppose that W \u2208 H and that W is projectable in the sense that [W, V] \u2282 V\n(the horizontal projection of any projectable vector field is projectable, and the Wi are\nprojectable as we pointed out before). Then \u2207W V = [W, V ].\nAssuming as before that [F, W] \u2282 W (which is automatically the case if F \u2208 W, and is\nan assumption in Part 2 of Theorem 1 if not), it is possible to define a Lie derivative by\nF of W-tensors: for example, in the case of a type (1, 1) W-tensor T as the commutator\nof operators ad F and T :\n(LF T )(W ) = [F, T (W )] \u2212 T [F, W ].\nProposition 5. If [F, W] \u2282 W, the vector field F defines a complement H of V in W.\nProof. We show now that, with the above definition, LF S defines two projection operators on W. We first show that (LF S)2 = id. We have, for V \u2208 V,\n(LF S)(V ) = [F, S(V )] \u2212 S[F, V ] = V\nand thus (LF S)2 (V ) = V . Also,\n(LF S)([F, V ]) = [F, S[F, V ]] \u2212 S[F, [F, V ]] = \u2212[F, V ] \u2212 S[F, [F, V ]].\nSince S[F, [F, V ]] \u2208 V, we have ((LF S)(S[F, [F, V ]]) = S[F, [F, V ]], and therefore\n(LF S)2 ([F, V ]) = \u2212(LF S)([F, V ]) \u2212 S[F, [F, V ]] = [F, V ].\nThe conclusion is that PH = 12 (id \u2212LF S) and PV = 21 (id +LF S) are complementary\nprojection operators, with e.g. PV (V ) = V and PH (V ) = 0; H = im PH is therefore a\ncomplement to V in W.\nWe will use this complement from now on.\nIn the case where M is a tangent manifold T (Q), we can take V to be the canonical vertical\ndistribution, and in particular W = X(T (Q)). The connection with covariant derivative\n\u2207 is then the Berwald connection associated to a system of autonomous second-order\n11\n\n\fdifferential equations, see e.g. [2] (taking into account the fact that the current connection\nis expressed in terms of vertical vector fields rather than vector fields along the tangent\nbundle projection). A similar construction exists for the case where M is the first jet\nmanifold of a bundle E \u2192 R, and where the second-order dynamics are time-dependent,\nsee e.g. [3, 9].\nThe Berwald connection can be used to describe special classes of second-order differential\nequation fields, such as the ones of quadratic type we had encountered in the introduction.\nThe 'mixed curvature' of the V-connection \u2207 is the (1,2) V-tensor field \u03b8 given by\n\u03b8(V1 , V2 )V3 = \u2207V H \u2207V2 V3 \u2212 \u2207V2 \u2207V H V3 \u2212 \u2207[V H ,V2 ] V3 .\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nProposition 6. Let V and W both be involutive and [F, W] \u2282 W. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of coordinates in which F takes the form of a quadratic\nsecond-order differential equation field is that \u03b8 = 0.\nProof. Let V\u0302 denote the set of V \u2208 V for which the corresponding V H is projectable, i.e.\nV satisfies [V H , V2 ] \u2208 V for all V2 \u2208 V. This set defines a module over the projectable\nfunctions on M (those functions f for which V1 (f ) = 0, for all V1 \u2208 V). Alternatively,\nV2 \u2208 V\u0302 if and only if \u2207V1 V2 = 0, for all V1 \u2208 V.\nLet V1 , V2 \u2208 V\u0302. Then\n\u2207V3 \u2207V H V2 = \u2212\u03b8(V1 , V3 )V2 \u2212 \u2207[V H ,V3 ] V2 + \u2207V H \u2207V3 V2 = \u2212\u03b8(V1 , V3 )V2 ,\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nmeaning that \u2207V H V2 is again projectable if and only if \u03b8 = 0.\n1\n\nLet \u03b8 = 0. If we set, for V1 , V2 \u2208 V\u0302 ,\nDV1 V2 = \u2207V H V2 ,\n1\n\none easily verifies that the operator D satisfies connection-like properties with respect to\nthe multiplication of elements of the module V\u0302 with projectable functions f :\nDf V1 V2 = f DV1 V2\n\nand\n\nDV1 f V2 = f DV1 V2 + V1H (f )V2 .\n\nRemark that V1H (f ) is again projectable, since for any V2 \u2208 V, V2 V1H (f ) = V1H V2 (f ) +\n[V2 , V1H ](f ) = 0.\nIn the coordinates as defined in Theorem 1 (regardless of whether F lies in W or not)\nthe connection coefficients are given by\nD\n\n\u2202\n\u2202y i\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= \u0393ijk k ,\nj\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n\nwhere \u0393ij = \u2212 12\n\n\u2202\u0393ij\n\u2202f i\ni\nand\n\u0393\n=\n.\njk\n\u2202y j\n\u2202y k\n\nk , or, equivalently, that the connection D is\nIt is clear from this expression that \u0393ijk = \u0393ji\nsymmetric, in the sense that the torsion\n\nDV1 V2 \u2212 DV2 V1 \u2212 S[V1H , V2H ]\n12\n\n\fvanishes.\nWe can therefore conclude that the functions \u0393kij are projectable if and only if \u03b8 = 0.\nFor that to be the case, f k must be of the form f k = \u0393ijk y i y j + Pik y i + Qk , for some\nprojectable functions Pik (t, x) and Qk (t, x).\nThe advantage of the current description is that the criterion \u03b8 = 0 can be verified in\nany given set of coordinates on M .\n\n4\n\nGlobal properties\n\nIn this section we will address the global bundle structure of a manifold M in the context\nof a given involutive distribution and a vector field F , assuming from the start that the\nset where the dimension of V + [F, V] is maximal is the whole of M , or in other words\nthat V + [F, V] is actually a distribution.\nLet M be an m-dimensional manifold with an involutive (and thus integrable) n-dimensional\ndistribution V. The foliation of the distribution defines an equivalence relation on M\nby declaring two elements of M to be equivalent if they lie in the same leaf of V. The\nquotient of M by means of this equivalence relation, say Q, will have the structure of a\ndifferentiable manifold if for every leaf one can find a smooth embedded local submanifold N through a point of the leaf, of dimension m \u2212 n, which has the property that each\nother leaf it meets is intersected in only one point. Then \u03c01 : M \u2192 Q defines a fibration,\nfor which the fibres have dimension n, and for which the distribution V coincides with\nthe tangents to the fibres.\nWe will assume that this condition is satisfied.\nIn the case of interest, Q comes also equipped with an integrable distribution. Indeed,\na projectable vector field on M is \u03c01 -related to a vector field on Q. Those projectable\nvector fields that happen to lie in W define therefore a distribution on Q, say W\u0304, which\nis involutive by construction. As above, the corresponding equivalence relation therefore\ndefines a new quotient, T , again assumed to be a manifold. We will denote the corresponding fibration by \u03c02 : Q \u2192 T . Alternatively, we could have defined a fibration by\nquotienting out the distribution W from the beginning. This structure will coincide with\nthe composition projection \u03c02 \u25e6 \u03c01 : M \u2192 T .\nAn almost tangent structure on an even dimensional manifold is a (1,1)-tensor field S\non that manifold, for which the kernel of S at each point coincides with its image. The\nalmost tangent structure is said to be integrable if its Nijenhuis torsion vanishes. If that\nis the case then the kernel of S is an involutive distribution. We now recall a result from\n[4]. Suppose that the kernel of an integrable almost tangent structure on a manifold\ndefines a fibration over some base manifold (as above, by taking the quotient of that\ndistribution). Suppose that each fibre is connected and simply connected, and that there\n13\n\n\fexists a flat connection on each fibre, for which the fibre is geodesically complete. Then\nthe manifold is the total manifold of an affine bundle modelled over the tangent bundle\nof the base manifold.\nThis theorem can be applied to the current setting, if we take a particular leaf LW of W\nto be the even dimensional manifold of interest. The projection \u03c01 will project this leaf\nLW of W onto a corresponding leaf LW\u0304 of W\u0304. Therefore we may consider the fibration\ngiven by the restriction \u03c01 |LW : LW \u2192 LW\u0304 . Vectors that are tangent to its fibres can\nbe identified with vectors in V, and the fibres themselves can be identified with leaves\nof V. We have defined a W-tensor field S on W in Proposition 4. It restricts naturally\nto an almost tangent structure on LW (i.e. S 2 = 0, NS = 0, and ker S = im S = VLW ).\nMoreover, we have seen that the restriction of the V-connection \u2207V (V \u2208 V) to a leaf of\nV gives a flat connection on that leaf. We can conclude therefore:\nTheorem 2. Suppose that each leaf of V is connected and simply connected, and assume\nthat each leaf of V is geodesically complete with respect to the restriction of \u2207V to that\nleaf. Then, for each LW of W, \u03c01 |LW : LW \u2192 LW\u0304 is an affine bundle, modelled over the\ntangent bundle T (LW\u0304 ) \u2192 LW\u0304 . Suppose further that the set N = {z \u2208 LW : F (z) \u2208 V} is\na global cross-section of \u03c01 |LW : then LW may be identified with T (LW\u0304 ) and N with the\nzero section.\nCorollary 1. In case F \u2208 W, and under the assumptions of the previous theorem, the\nrestriction of F to a certain leaf LW \u2261 T (LW\u0304 ) will be a second-order differential equation\nfield on T (LW\u0304 ).\nProof. This follows easily from the coordinate expression of F . Restricting F to a leaf\nis the same as fixing the parameters tp to some constant values.\nFor completeness, we mention that one may find an alternative formulation of the theorem of [4] in [5], where the global conditions on an (assumed given) symmetric connection are replaced by global conditions on an (assumed given) vector field. In our current\nframework, the restriction of the vector field S(F ) to LW plays the role of that vector\nfield.\nIn case F does not belong to W, but leaves it invariant, F defines a vector field F\u0303 on T .\nThis vector field defines a 1-dimensional involutive distribution on T , leading as before\nto a fibration T \u2192 T0 . If we assume that the vector field F\u0303 is complete, an integral curve\nof F\u0303 will define a 1-dimensional submanifold T1 of T . In turn, the preimage of T1 under\n\u03c02 is a collection E of leaves of W\u0304 lying over that integral curve. We can think of the\nrestriction of \u03c02 to E as defining a fibration \u03c02 |E : E \u2192 T1 . Let's denote its 1-jet bundle\nby J 1 (E) \u2192 E.\nThe distribution WF = hF i\u2295W is also involutive. Its leaves LWF are (2n+1)-dimensional\nmanifolds that are projected by means of \u03c01 onto one of the above described manifolds\nE, corresponding to a certain integral curve (with image T1 ) of F\u0303 . The fibres of \u03c01 |LWF :\n14\n\n\fLWF \u2192 E can again be identified with V. Recall that we had defined a symmetric flat\nconnection on each leaf of V.\nBy setting S(F ) = 0 we can extend S to a WF -tensor field, which has the property that\nits restriction to a leaf of WF satisfies S 2 = 0, NS = 0 and rank S = n. These properties\nare exactly those that define, in the terminology of [10], an 'almost jet structure'. The\nabove mentioned theorem in [4] has been generalized to (2n + 1)-dimensional manifolds\nwith almost jet structures in [10], where a 1-jet bundle replaces the role played by a\ntangent bundle (see the Theorem on page 90 of [10]). We are in the situation that we\ncan apply this theorem, since each LWF is a (2n + 1)-dimensional manifold with a 2ndimensional distribution W|LWF which is completely integrable and which is such that\nim S = V|LWF \u2282 W|LWF . We may therefore conclude:\nTheorem 3. Suppose that each leaf of V is connected and simply connected, and assume\nthat each leaf of V is geodesically complete with respect to the restriction of \u2207V to that\nleaf. In case F \u2208\n/ W and [F, W] \u2282 W, each leaf LWF of WF is diffeomorphic to the 1-jet\nbundle J 1 (E) of E \u2192 T1 .\nCorollary 2. Under the assumptions of the previous theorem, the restriction of F to\na certain leaf LWF \u2261 J 1 (E) will be a time-dependent second-order differential equation\nfield on J 1 (E).\nProof. This follows again from the coordinate expression of F . Restricting F to a leaf is\nthe same as fixing all parameters tp to some constant values, except for t1 .\nThe cases of most obvious interest are those in which the dimension of M is either 2n or\n2n + 1 (n being the dimension of V). We end this section with a statement of our global\nresults in these cases, in a form which collects together the assumptions we have made.\nTheorem 4. Let V be an involutive distribution of dimension n on a manifold M of\ndimension m, m = 2n or 2n + 1; and F a vector field such that V \u2229 [F, V] = {0}. Assume\nthat\n\u2022 M is fibred over a manifold Q and the leaves of V are the fibres of this fibration;\n\u2022 each leaf of V is connected and simply connected;\n\u2022 each leaf of V is geodesically complete with respect to the flat symmetric connection\ninduced on it (as described in Section 3);\n\u2022 V + [F, V] is a distribution (necessarily of dimension 2n).\nIn the case m = 2n, assume further that\n\u2022 the set {z \u2208 M : F (z) \u2208 V} is a global cross-section of M \u2192 Q.\n15\n\n\fThen M may be identified with T (Q) and F with a second-order differential equation\nfield on T (Q).\nIn the case m = 2n + 1 assume further that\n\u2022 W = V + [F, V] is involutive;\n\u2022 F \u2208\n/ W, [F, W] \u2282 W;\n\u2022 F is complete;\n\u2022 Q is fibred over R, and the leaves of W\u0304 (the projection of W to Q) are the fibres\nof this fibration.\nThen M may be identified with J 1 (Q) and F with a time-dependent second-order differential equation field on J 1 (Q).\n\n5\n\nAn illustrative example\n\nThe cases in which dim M is 2n or 2n + 1 may be of most obvious interest, but they are\nby no means the only cases of interest, as we now show by an example.\nLet Q be the configuration space of a Lagrangian system with regular Lagrangian L\nand assume that L is invariant under the (free and proper) action of a symmetry Lie\ngroup G. In that case, the Euler-Lagrange field \u0393 \u2208 X(T (Q)) is G-invariant and it can\nbe reduced to a vector field \u0393\u030c on T (Q)/G. The corresponding equations for finding the\nintegral curves of \u0393\u030c are known in the literature as the 'Lagrange-Poincar\u00e9 equations', see\ne.g. [1]. The equations determining the reduced vector field \u0393\u030c \u2208 X(T (Q)/G) can be cast\nin terms of the reduced Lagrangian l on T (Q)/G.\nWe will follow here closely the description we have given in [8]. With the aid of a principal\nconnection on Q \u2192 Q/G one may decompose T (Q)/G into T (Q/G) \u2295 (Q \u00d7 g)/G, where\nthe action of G on g is the adjoint action. In what follows (xi , v i , wp ) are local coordinates\non T (Q)/G, where the (xi ) are coordinates on Q/G, and (v i , wp ) are fibre coordinates\ncorresponding to the decomposition.\nWe will assume that the symmetry group is Abelian. This has the advantage that the\nadjoint action is trivial. The vector field \u0393\u030c can then be determined from:\n\u0393\u030c(xi ) = v i\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202l\n\u2202l\np k \u2202l\nv\n\u2212 i = Kik\n\u0393\u030c\ni\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n\u2202wp\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202l\n= 0.\n\u0393\u030c\n\u2202wp\n\n16\n\n\fp\nHere Kik\nare the components of the curvature of the principal connection with respect\nto an invariant basis. The coordinate expression of the reduced field is therefore of the\nform \u0393\u030c = v i \u2202/\u2202xi + \u0393i \u2202/\u2202v i + \u0393p \u2202/\u2202wp , where \u0393i and \u0393p are functions on T (Q)/G.\n\nIn the assumption that the matrix (\u2202 2 l/\u2202wp \u2202wq ) is everywhere non-singular, and that\nthe relation \u2202l/\u2202wp = \u03bcp can therefore be rewritten in the form wp = \u03c1p (x, v, \u03bc), we\ncan perform a coordinate transformation (xi , v i , wp ) \u2192 (x\u0304i = xi , v\u0304 i = v i , \u03bcp = \u2202l/\u2202wp ).\nThe last equation is then simply \u0393\u030c (\u03bcp ) = 0, that is to say: the coordinates \u03bcp can\nbe regarded as parameters. In the new coordinates the reduced vector field becomes\n\u0393\u030c = v\u0304 i \u2202/\u2202 x\u0304i + \u0393i \u2202/\u2202v\u0304 i + 0\u2202/\u2202\u03bcp .\nThe first two equations determine a system of second-order ordinary differential equations\nin the variables xi with parameters \u03bcp . By introducing Routh's (reduced) function\nR\u03bc (x, v) = l(x, v, \u03c1(x, v, \u03bc)) \u2212 \u03bcp \u03c1p (x, v, \u03bc)\nthese equations, restricted to fixed values for the \u03bc s, can equivalently be rewritten as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202R\u03bc\n\u2202R\u03bc\np k\n\u0393\u030c\n= Kik\nv \u03bcp .\n\u2212\n\u2202v i\n\u2202xi\nThis equation is known as Routh's (reduced) equation for an Abelian symmetry group,\nsee e.g. [6].\nWe show that the situation described above is in agreement with the statements of\nTheorem 1 and Corollary 1. Recall first the definition of the momentum map J : T (Q) \u2192\ng\u2217 , where hJ(v), \u03bei = (\u03be\u0303 V L)(v) (for each \u03be \u2208 g, \u03be \u0303 \u2208 X(Q) is the corresponding fundamental\nvector field). It is well-known that the map T (Q) \u2192 Q \u00d7 g\u2217 , (q, v) 7\u2192 (q, J(v)) is Gequivariant, where the action of G on g\u2217 is the coadjoint action. Therefore, it reduces\nto a map J\u02c7 : T (Q)/G \u2192 (Q \u00d7 g\u2217 )/G. But for an Abelian group the adjoint action is\ntrivial, so the coadjoint action is also trivial. It follows that J is invariant, and that the\nimage of the reduced momentum J\u02c7 is Q/G \u00d7 g\u2217 . In the current coordinates J\u02c7 is simply\n(x\u0304, v\u0304, \u03bc) 7\u2192 (x\u0304, \u03bc).\nLet M = T (Q)/G and F = \u0393\u030c. The distribution V = ker T J\u02c7 is clearly involutive.\nIt has the commuting basis given by the vector fields \u2202/\u2202v\u0304 i . It is easy to see that\n[F, V] \u2229 V = {0}. The distribution W = V + [F, V] is spanned by {\u2202/\u2202 x\u0304i , \u2202/\u2202v\u0304 i } and is\ninvolutive as well. It is the distribution formed by the vector fields on T (Q)/G which\nare tangent to the level sets of momentum. A leaf of W is thus a particular level set,\n\u03bcp = \u03bc0p . The corresponding N in the statement of Theorem 1 can be identified with\nim J\u02c7 = Q/G \u00d7 g\u2217 , and is non-empty. So Theorem 1 applies.\nThe quotient space Q of Section 4 can be identified with Q/G \u00d7 g\u2217 . It is trivially fibred\nover T = g\u2217 ; W\u0304 is the distribution formed by the (projections of the) \u2202/\u2202 x\u0304i , and any\nleaf of W\u0304 can therefore be identified with Q/G. According to Theorem 2, therefore, the\nrestriction of F to a level set of momentum \u03bc = \u03bc0 is a second-order differential equation\nfield on Q/G (a leaf of W\u0304); it is of course the one which satisfies Routh's reduced equation\nwith \u03bcp = \u03bc0p .\n17\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe first author is a Postdoctoral Fellow of the Research Foundation \u2013 Flanders (FWO).\nThe second author is a Guest Professor at Ghent University: he is grateful to the Department of Mathematics for its hospitality.
