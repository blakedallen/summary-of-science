However, there is an ever increasing demand by the users for circularly\n\n27\n\npolarized FEL pulses with helicity switching frequency up to kilohertz, especially in the soft x-ray\n\n28\n\nspectral regime.\n\n1\n\nEmail: denghaixiao@sinap.ac.cn\n\n\f1\n\nOne possible solution for fast helicity switching is the technique of crossed planar undulators [7].\n\n2\n\nThe key point of crossed undulator is making the electromagnetic radiation along the horizontal and\n\n3\n\nvertical axis as identical as possible, including the amplitude and the phase. Recently, various\n\n4\n\napproaches using crossed undulators for polarization control have been reported for the LINAC-based\n\n5\n\nhigh-gain single-pass FELs [8-13] and storage ring-based FEL oscillators [14, 15]. For self-amplified\n\n6\n\nspontaneous emission (SASE) FEL, the best time to place the crossed undulators is just before its\n\n7\n\npower saturation, and then the density modulation induced by the SASE process will nearly keep the\n\n8\n\nsame while passing through the crossed undulators. However, the intrinsic spiky structure and the\n\n9\n\nshot-to-shot fluctuation of SASE will cause FEL polarization performance degradation. For the seeded\n\n10\n\nFELs, the density modulation is due to the interaction of the electrons and the external seed laser, and\n\n11\n\nresults in stable and fully coherent output radiations. Thus with the crossed undulators technique,\n\n12\n\nexcellent polarization control performances are expected in the seeded FELs.\n\n13\n\nSeeded FELs are attractive ways for fully coherent soft x-ray radiations, and thus more and more\n\n14\n\nseeded FEL projects are proposed in this regime [16-19]. Among them, Shanghai soft x-ray FEL\n\n15\n\n(SXFEL) [20, 21] is a two-stage high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) [22, 23] with the frequency\n\n16\n\nup-conversion from 270nm to 9nm. Utilizing crossed undulators with resonance at the harmonics of 9\n\n17\n\nnm radiation as 4.5nm or 3nm afterburner [24], SXFEL holds promising prospects for generating fully\n\n18\n\ncoherent radiations with variable polarization in the \"water-window\" region.\n\n19\n\nIn this paper, the designs of polarization control experiment at Shanghai deep ultraviolet FEL\n\n20\n\n(SDUV-FEL) [25], a test bed for SXFEL, are given, including the start-to-end simulations and the\n\n21\n\nexperiment preparations. It shows that 90% circular polarization degree could be achieved at\n\n22\n\nSDUV-FEL experiments, which will serve as a polarization control prototype for the future SXFEL.\n\n23\n\n2.\n\nPolarization control for SDUV-FEL\n\n24\n\nSDUV-FEL is a 160 MeV test facility. Up to now, SASE [26], HGHG [27] and echo-enabled\n\n25\n\nharmonic generation (EEHG) [28] have been experimentally demonstrated at SDUV-FEL. By using the\n\n26\n\nexisting double-modulator structure and adding some minor revisions, it is also suitable for testing the\n\n27\n\nFEL polarization control experiments. The schematic of the system layout is shown on Figure 1.\n\n28\n\n\f1\n\nFig.1. Schematic of SDUV-FEL polarization control mode. The crossed undulators include a pair of\n\n2\n\npermanent planar undulator PMU50-H and PMU50-V, where H and V indicates the horizontal and\n\n3\n\nvertical linear polarized radiation, respectively. A small chicane, so-called \"phase-shifter\" is used to\n\n4\n\nshift the path delay between the electron and the light.\n\n5\n\nThe polarization control option for SDUV-FEL is proposed to be based on a seeded approach.\n\n6\n\nFirstly, the electron beam is accelerated to 136 MeV, and passes through the first modulator EMU65\n\n7\n\nand the first dispersive section Chicane I of the EEHG structure, where the density modulation of the\n\n8\n\nelectron beam is optimized by interaction with the 10 MW peak power, 1047 nm seed laser. Then the\n\n9\n\nmicro-bunched electron beam will emit coherent 523 nm radiation with horizontal linear polarization,\n\n10\n\ni.e. the second harmonic of 1047 nm seed laser, in the second modulator PMU50-H of the EEHG\n\n11\n\nstructure. Before entering the long radiator of EEHG, a customized undulator PMU50-V is followed to\n\n12\n\ngenerate another 523 nm radiation with vertical linear polarization. The density modulation of the\n\n13\n\nelectron beam maintains when passing through the two short crossed planar undulators, thus generates\n\n14\n\ntwo linear polarized radiations with nearly equivalent power and phase, which is important for\n\n15\n\nenhancing the quality of polarized FEL. A small phase-shifter is used for fine tuning of the path\n\n16\n\ndifference between the horizontal and vertical linear polarized light, hence to switch the helicity of the\n\n17\n\ncombined circularly polarized FEL light.\n\n18\n19\n20\n\nTable 1 lists the nominal parameters of polarization control mode at SDUV-FEL, which are mainly\nfrom the start-to-end simulations and the measurements during the early commissioning stage.\nTable 1.

It\n\n11\n\ndemonstrates two Fourier-Transform-Limited output radiation pulses with horizontal and vertical linear\n\n12\n\npolarization, respectively. The full pulse length is about 5 ps and the pulse energy is 100 nJ order. For\n\n13\n\nthe combined final radiation, the total polarization degree is rather stable with a level above 90%. It is\n\n14\n\nworth stressing that one can slightly tuning the gaps of crossed undulators to obtain almost equivalent\n\n15\n\noutput FEL power, and thus further enhancing the polarization degree of final radiation. However, due\n\n16\n\nto the imperfection of the two crossed linear polarized FEL pulses and the slippage effect between the\n\n17\n\nelectron beam and FEL light, the final total polarization cannot reach 100%.\n\n18\n\nWith the phase-shifter, the relative phase difference of the two 523 nm radiations from the crossed\n\n19\n\nundulators can be adjusted, and hence achieving easy helicity switching. Moreover, one can figure out\n\n20\n\nthat, 14% peak to peak stability of the electromagnetic phase-shifter is tolerable for a requirement of\n\n21\n\ncircular polarization degree larger than 85%, which is fairly loose.\n\n\f1\n2\n\nFig. 2. Start-to-end simulation of FEL polarization control at SDUV-FEL, the upper shows the\n\n3\n\npolarization degree variation as the phase-shifter tuning; the lower illustrates the FEL pulse in the time\n\n4\n\ndomain and the frequency domain, respectively.\n\n5\n\nGenerally speaking, to achieve perfect circular polarization, the radiations from the two crossed\n\n6\n\nundulators should be identical and they should transversely and longitudinally overlap with each other.\n\n7\n\nPrevious experiments [31, 32] show a local energy spread of 0.5~2 keV for the electron beam of\n\n8\n\nSDUV-FEL, which indicates that the bunching factor of 523 nm radiation could be pretty large. Since\n\n9\n\nthe dispersion of the phase-shifter is about 2 microns and the crossed radiators are only 10 periods, the\n\n10\n\nelectron beam can be treated as a rigid micro-bunched beam. Therefore, the planar undulator PMU50-H\n\n11\n\nand PMU50-V should supply identical radiations, and we mainly consider the overlap issue, especially\n\n12\n\nthe slippage effects in the following discussions.\n\n13\n\nBecause of the electron beam slippage effects before entering the second planar undulator, the\n\n14\n\nlongitudinal overlap of FEL radiations emitted by the two crossed undulators will naturally imperfect,\n\n15\n\nwhich will degrade the polarization performance of the final combined radiation. Figure 3 shows the\n\n16\n\nELEGANT [33] results of the electron beam longitudinal distribution at the exit of LINAC. Since only\n\n17\n\nS-band accelerating tubes are used in SDUV-FEL, the residual energy chirp induced by radiofrequency\n\n18\n\ncurvature is inevitable. The beam energy chirp imprints a phase chirp in the emitted FEL radiations,\n\n19\n\nwhich will further aggravate the polarization performance together with the slippage effects.\n\n\f1\n2\n\nFig. 3. The longitudinal profiles of the electron bunch after LINAC. The solid and dashed indicate\n\n3\n\nbeam energy and beam current, respectively.\n\n4\n\nIn the current configuration of SDUV-FEL, the planar undulator PMU50-H is followed by a 2 m\n\n5\n\nlong Chicane II which serves as the second dispersion in EEHG operation mode. To clearly illustrate\n\n6\n\nthe beam energy chirp effects on the final FEL polarization performance, intensive start-to-end\n\n7\n\nsimulations have been performed for comparison study between two cases, i.e. keeping Chicane II still\n\n8\n\nand placing PMU50-V after Chicane II (Case I), and moving Chicane II backward and placing\n\n9\n\nPMU50-V before Chicane II (Case II). Actually, Case II is the optimized configuration as shown in\n\n10\n\nFigure 1.\n\n11\n\nFigure 4 gives the radiation phases of the two cases. It is clear that the accumulated polarization\n\n12\n\ndegradation induced by the relative phase difference is much smaller in Case II than in Case I. The\n\n13\n\ncalculations show that the maximum circular polarization degree is only 60% in Case I, while 92% in\n\n14\n\nCase II. If the residual energy chirp is removed, i.e. given a uniform beam energy profile, the final\n\n15\n\ncircular polarization degree would increase from 60% to 95% even for Case I. Thus it is convinced that\n\n16\n\nthe residual energy chirp, rather than the beam slippage is deleterious to the FEL polarization quality\n\n17\n\nfor SDUV-FEL.\n\n18\n\n\f1\n\nFig. 4. Radiation phase of Ex (solid line) and Ey (dash line) comparison between Case I (left) and Case\n\n2\n\nII (right).\n\n3\n\n4.\n\nThe Crossed Undulators and Phase-Shifter\n\n4\n\nThe crossed planar undulator is one of the most important components for FEL polarization control\n\n5\n\nexperiments. At present, there is a planar permanent magnetic undulator PMU50-H with alterable gap\n\n6\n\nat SDUV-FEL, which can generate FEL with linear polarization at x-direction, and a new customized\n\n7\n\nPMU50-V whose magnetic field is crossed with the PMU50-H, will generate radiation with linear\n\n8\n\npolarization at y-direction.\n\n9\n\nThe PMU50-V structure is assumed to be similar with the existing PMU50-H except the field\n\n10\n\ndirection. The magnetic poles are made of Nd-Fe-B material, and the residual magnetism is greater\n\n11\n\nthan 1.23 T. The gap of PMU50-V can be altered by a mechanical-motor from 12 to 60 mm, and the\n\n12\n\npeak field can be up to 0.9 T. The simulation results show that the final polarization performance is not\n\n13\n\nsensitive to the field error of undulator, therefore peak-to-peak field error less than 2% is ensured in the\n\n14\n\ndesign of PMU50-V.\n\n15\n\nThe phase-shifter is another key component. It is made up of 3 small electromagnetic dipoles,\n\n16\n\nchicane-like structure, with total length of 0.3 m. The dispersion of the phase-shifter is about 2 microns,\n\n17\n\nwhich enables a phase tuning ability from 0 to 4\u03c0 for 523 nm radiation.\n\n18\n\n5.\n\nOptical Diagnostics for FEL Polarization\n\n19\n\nThe FEL radiations can be extracted out of the vacuum chamber after the crossed undulators by an\n\n20\n\noptical transition radiation (OTR) target UNPRF3 which is used to observe laser-beam spatial overlap\n\n21\n\nin PMU50-H during the EEHG operation of SDUV-FEL. The reflected angle can be controlled by\n\n22\n\nrotating the OTR mirror, then the pulse energy and spectra can be measured at different angle. At the\n\n23\n\ndownstream of the reflection OTR mirror (seen in figure 5), several kinds of optical devices are placed\n\n24\n\non the optical diagnostic bench, including focusing lens, polarizer, quarter wave-plate and detectors.\n\n25\n\nOne can choose different azimuths (\u03b8c and \u03b8p) to obtain the transport matrices and the corresponding\n\n26\n\nlight intensities (measured at D2) for getting all Stokes parameters of the FEL radiation mathematically,\n\n27\n\nthen figure out the polarization degree and angle according to formulae (1) and (2). Since the accuracy\n\n28\n\nof the polarization measurement highly depends on the intensity stability of the output FEL, a reference\n\n29\n\npulse energy detector (D1) is utilized for avoiding the shot-to-shot fluctuations induced by the electron\n\n30\n\nbeam instability.\n\n\f1\n2\n\nFig.5. Illustration of the measurement of FEL polarization.\n\n3\n\nAn off-line calibration of the optical diagnostic bench could be accomplished by using a green light,\n\n4\n\ne.g., the second harmonic of the seed laser. Then the on-site measurement can be achieved by tuning\n\n5\n\nthe magnetic field of the small phase-shifter between the two radiators, and thus the polarization status\n\n6\n\ncan be switched and measured in real time. In the experiment, a movable optical aperture could be\n\n7\n\nutilized to select the region of interest from the whole transverse plane and investigate the spatial\n\n8\n\nnon-uniformity effects on the polarization performance.\n\n9\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\n10\n\nWith some modifications on the current configuration, FEL polarization control experiment can be\n\n11\n\ncarried out at SDUV-FEL. After the electron beam modulated by the 1047 nm laser, a pair of crossed\n\n12\n\nundulators will be used to generate two linear polarized 523 nm radiations, Ex and Ey, respectively.\n\n13\n\nThen the polarization status of combined FEL can be controlled with an electromagnetic phase-shifter.\n\n14\n\nAt the end of the crossed undulators, optical diagnostic station can provide on-site characterizations,\n\n15\n\nincluding spectra, pulse energy and the polarization parameters of the output FEL. Start-to-end\n\n16\n\nsimulations show that, the total polarization degree can be up to 95% and the circular polarization can\n\n17\n\nbe no less than 90% with FEL pulse energy of 100 nJ level.\n\n18\n\nMoreover, the polarization control experiment at SDUV-FEL serves as a prototype experiment for\n\n19\n\nthe Shanghai soft x-ray FEL, in which, high brilliance, short-pulse, fully coherent FEL radiations with\n\n20\n\nvariable polarization is expected in the \"water-window\" spectral regime, which may open up new\n\n21\n\nscientific opportunities in various research fields.\n\n22\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n23\n\nThe authors would like to thank Yuhui Li, Bart Faatz and Zhirong Huang for useful discussions.
