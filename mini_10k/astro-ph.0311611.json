USA\n\nAbstract\nThe Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) Long\nwavelength Spectrometer (LWS) has been used to\nmap distribution of the emission from a sample of 22\natomic, molecular and ionised lines toward the\nCircumnuclear Disk (CND) at the Galactic Centre.\nThe CND disc is clearly seen in the maps of\nmolecular lines such as CO and OH, whilst the\ncentral region dominates in other atomic and ionised\nlines such as OIII and NIII. The spectrum toward Sgr\nA* is best represented by the sum of a 58 K\nblackbody, superposed with 22 identifiable emission\nor absorption features, including four lines each\nattributed to CO and OH, two broad features that\nmay be indicative of a complex of solid state\nfeatures, two H2O lines, and the rest being various\natomic or ionised atomic lines. The CO emission is\nbest fit by gas having Tkin ~ 900 - 1400 K and nH2 ~\n104 \u2013 104.5 cm-3.\nIntroduction\nThe nucleus of our Galaxy is located ~ 8.5 kpc from\nthe Earth, more one hundredth of the distance to the\nnearest large external galaxy, or one thousandth that\nto the nearest active galaxy. Due to relatively high\nspatial resolution achievable, it provides a unique\ninsight into the structures of more distant nuclei and\nis our nearest template for the conditions that pust\nexist in many other similar galactic nuclei. The\ndistribution of atomic molecular and ionised gas\ntoward the Galactic Centre (GC) has been\nsummarised by many authors, including Genzel\nTownes (1987), Genzel, Hollenbach Townes (1994),\nShields & Ferland (1994), Zylka et al (1994, 1995),\nand Coil & Ho (2000). An unusual compact (size ~ 1\nAU - Krichbaum et al 1993, Rogers et al 1994)\nvariable radio source lying close to the dynamical\ncentre of the Galaxy, Sgr A* has been suggested to\nbe either a quiescent black hole. Within 1\u2032\u2032 (0.2 pc) of\nSgr A* is the bright infrared complex, IRS16, which\ncontains at least 15 components, and is probably the\nsource of the strong stellar wind which has velocities\nof up to \u2265 700 km s-1. Surrounding this is a cavity dominated by atomic and ionised gas, containing a\nmass \u2265 2 106 M~, and luminosity ~ 7 106 - 2.3 107\nL~. Most of this energy is absorbed by the\nsurrounding material, and then re-emitted as IR\ncontinuum, and by atomic and molecular line\nemission. Zylka et al (1995) show the column density\nof warm (T ~ 200 - 400 K) absorbing dust in the\ncentre of the cavity is less than that of the\nsurrounding CND molecular gas and dust torus.\n\n1\n\nThe CND is a ring of gas and dust, rotating around\nthe central ionised cavity with a velocity ~ 110 km s-1\nand having a mass ~ 104 M~ of clumpy material.\nFirst recognised from the far-infrared observations by\nBecklin, Gatley & Werner (1982) it extends from a\nradius of 1.5 - 2 pc out to ~ 6 - 8 pc, and may be\nconnected to the gravitational potential of material in\nthe GC (Duschl 1989). Molecular line studies shows\nthe CND to be composed predominantly of highly\nexcited gas, co-rotating in the same general direction\nas the rest of the Galaxy (positive vlsr at positive I,\ninclined at 20 \u2013 30o to the Galactic Plane, and 20 \u2013\n25o to the line of sight - Fukui et al 1977, Genzel et al\n1982, Harris et al 1985, Sandqvist & Loren 1985,\nSerabyn et al 1986, G\u00fcsten et al 1987 a,b). Although\ndensest at the inner edge (radial distances ~ 2 pc), it\nextends at least ~ 8 pc north and south of Sgr A*. It\nmay be a transient feature, where material in the Sgr\nA East dust shell has interacted with the central\nstellar cluster. The neutral material in this ring is\nbelieved to be hot (T ~ 150-450K), dense (nH2 ~ 103-7\ncm-3), and fragmented (Genzel et al 1982, 1988 with a filling factor ~ 10%, Zylka et al 1995, McGary\net al 2001, Wright et al 2001). The ring contains \u2265\n104 M~ of gas (Mezger et al 1989), based on 1.3\nmm continuum and CO observations. It has a clumpy\nand filamentary (Yusef-Zadeh et al 2001) structure\nthat allows ultraviolet radiation from the central\nionised region to penetrate into the neutral ring,\nheating and photoionising the gas. The likely source\nof this radiation is the cluster of hot, luminous stars,\nsome of which are the HeI/HI stars detected by\nKrabbe et al (1991). The presence of hot gas was\nindependently inferred from the detection of near-IR\nH2 emission, which suggested that the material was\nshock excited at the edge of the ionised region\n(Gatley et al 1984). The neutral gas in the ring\nappears to be dynamically coupled to the gas in the\ncentral cavity of ionised and atomic gas, and has its\nrotational axis close to that of the larger scale\nGalactic rotation. The sharp edge of the CND abuts\ndirectly against the ionised arc-like filaments (The\nMini-spiral), which has led to speculation that\nmaterial from the CND may be falling towards the\nCentre along the ionised arms of the mini-spiral.\nMid-IR and submillimetre continuum data (Zylka et\nal 1995, Latvakoski et al 1999) show that the central\n~ 30\u2032\u2032 diameter cavity contains ~ 400 M~of dust at T\n~ 40 K, 4 M~ at ~ 170 K and ~ 0.01 M~ at ~ 400K.\nThe Galactic Centre is viewed through a foreground\nvisual extinction, Av ~ 31 magnitudes (Scoville et al\n2003). The luminosity of the emitted radiation for\n\n\fthese three phases is ~ 2 106 L~, 4 106 L~ and 5 105\nL~ respectively. The hottest gas lies close to Sgr A*,\nwhilst the brightest far-infrared emission comes from\nthe transition region between the neutral CND and\nsurrounding HII regions such as Sgr A East (a\nsynchrotron shell-like source lying behind the central\nHII region (Pedlar et al 1989) - probably formed\nfollowing an explosive event inside its core, and Sgr\nA West - the central HII region within which Sgr A*\nis embedded (Dent et al 1993). Lying further out are\ntwo molecular clouds, M-0.02-0.07 (also known as\nthe 50 km s-1 cloud) and M-0.13-0.08 (also known as\nthe 20 km s-1 cloud). These two clouds are believed\nto be connected together with the core of Sgr A East\n(Mezger et al 1989, Okumura et al 1991, Ho 1994).\nObservations\nIn this paper we report new observations of the CND\nregion around Sgr A*, including a 40 position, half\nbeam sampled map made using the Long wavelength\nspectrometer (LWS - spectral range 45-195 \u03bcm) on\nthe Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) satellite. This\nis supported by observations of submillimetre\nwavelength continuum and line emission obtained\nwith the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in\nHawaii. The grid observed with ISO covered the\ncomplete CNR region, and the nearby Sgr A West\nsource. The observations were made in the LWS full\nrange grating scan observing mode, and were\nanalysed using the ISAP 1.6 / LIA 1.7 standard\nsoftware tools. In addition to the normal data product\nprocessing, we applied an additional strong source\ncorrection, designed to correct for non-linear\nbehaviour in the detector response. Fig. 1 shows the\nISO LWS spectrum observed towards Sgr A*. The\nspectrum is dominated by the 63 mm OI line, with a\nfurther 21 spectral line features that can be\ndistinguished - some of which are blended with other\nfainter lines. Several of the lines are seen in\nabsorption against the continuum emission - notably\ntransitions of OH, H2O and CH.\nThe lines are superimposed on top of the strong\ncontinuum from Sgr A*, making the weaker ones\ndifficult to see on this scaling. A blackbody fit to the\ncontinuum emission gives a best fit dust temperature\nof 58 K - which is somewhat lower than the midinfrared colour temperatures that range from 140 300 K estimated by Telesco et al (1996), Chan et al\n(1997), and Latvakoski et al (1999) with smaller\nbeams. The 75 \u03bcm continuum emission peaks\ncentrally at the location of Sgr A*, and shows some\nevidence for extended emission running SW-NE\nalong the Galactic Plane.\nThe spectrum shown in Fig, 2 has had a 58 K\nblackbody spectrum subtracted from it to emphasise\nthe line emission.\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. LWS spectrum from 40 to 195 microns.\nThe vertical scale is in units of W cm-2 \u03bcm-1.\n\nFigure 2. LWS spectrum from 40 to 195 microns.\nWith a 58K blackbody curve removed. The vertical\nscale is in units of W cm-2 \u03bcm-1.\n\n\fThe CND can be clearly seen in a number of the\nmolecular lines, including CO and OH - examples\nare shown in Fig 3.\n\nFigure 4 CO line intensities modeled using an LVG\ncode, for different excitation temperatures.\nOther lines\nMaps of the atomic and ionic emission lines are\nshown in Fig 5.\nFigure 3 Maps in the CO J= 4-3, 14-13, 15-14 and\n16-15 transition, showing the shape of the CND. The\nrespolution of the J= 4-3 data is 10\u2032\u2032, and for the\nothers is 70\u2032\u2032.\nWe have modeled the CO transitions mapped by\nISO, along with CO J = 3-2 and 4-3 maps obtained\nusing the JCMT, in Fig 4. Since the CO J = 3-2, and\nJ = 4-3 lines were observed with beam sizes of 15\nand 10 arcsec respectively, it was necessary to\nconvolve the maps with a gaussian smoothing beam\nto achieve the same angular resolution as the ISO\ndata. These data were modeled using a large velocity\ngradient transfer code. In this model, the opacity\neffects in the lines are taken into account by\nintroducing an escape probability formalism. A weak\ndiffuse radiation field was introduced by including\nthe thermal continuum of a dust at a temperature Tdust\n= 58 K, since this was typical of blackbody fits to the\nshape of the continuum emission observed with the\nLWS. The molecular abundance of CO relative to H2,\nX(CO), was assumed to be 8 10-5. The LVG code\nwas run for a 40 level model, varying the kinetic\ntemperature Tkin in 100K steps between 300 and\n2200K, for a range of densities nH2 ~ between 103\nand 108 cm-3. The collisional rate coefficients used\nare described by Larsson, Liseau & Men'shchikov\n(2002).\nFigure 4 Maps of the CND running clockwise from\ntop right; OI 145, OIII 88, OH 79, NIII 57, NII 121,\nCII 157, OII 51 and OI 63 \u03bcm lines.\n\n3\n\n\fConclusions\n\nFrancisco: Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 1994.\n\nThe spectrum toward Sgr A* is best represented by\nthe sum of a 58 K blackbody, superposed by 22\nidentifiable emission or absorption features,\nincluding four lines each attributed to CO and OH,\ntwo broad features that may be indicative of a\ncomplex of solid state features, two H2O lines, and\nthe rest being atomic or ionised atomic lines.\n\nHolland, W.

Genzel and A. I.\nHarris. Kluwer Academic Publishers\n\nMaps of the CO emission show the structure iof the\ncircumnuclear ring. The CO gas excitation is best fit\nby gas having Tkin ~ 900 - 1400K and n(H2) ~ 104 \u2013\n104.5 cm-3.\nThe well known molecular ring that starts ~ 2 pc\nfrom the centre is seen in lines of CO, CH and OH\nsurrounds a central cavity which is prominent in\natomic line emission from species such as carbon,\noxygen and nitrogen. The CND is predominatly\ntraced by molecular line emission, whereas the\ncentral cavity is more prominent in the atomic lines.\nReferences\nAitken, D.K., Griffiths, J., Jones, B.
