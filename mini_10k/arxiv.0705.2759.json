Pseudorapidity spectra and\npT distributions for produced charged particles as well as net baryons (per pair of\npartcipants) and their rapidity loss are compared to data at RHIC and predictions for\nLHC energies are discussed.\n\nIn previous papers [1] we studied the possible role of topological baryon junctions\n[2] [3], and the effects of strong color field (SCF) in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC\nenergies. In the framework of HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 model, the new algorithm for junction\nanti-junction JJ\u0304 loops provide a possible explanation for baryon/meson anomaly. The\nSCF effects as implemented within our model gives a better description of this anomaly.\nAt LHC energies, due to higher initial energy density (or temperature) we expect an\nincrease of the mean value of the string tension (\u03ba) [4].\nThe day 1 measurements at the LHC will include results on multiplicity\ndistributions with important consequences for our understanding of matter produced\nin the collisions [5],[6]. From our model calculations one expects dNch\nPbPb /d\u03b7 \u2248 3500 at\n\u03b7 = 0 in central (0-5 %) Pb +Pb collision. This correspond to \u2248 17.5 produced charged\nhadrons per participant pair. These values are higher than those obtained by requiring\nthat both limiting fragmentation and the trapezoidal shape of the pseudo-rapidity\ndistribution persist at the LHC [6]. Our model predicts a characteristic violations of the\napparently universal trend, seen up to maximum RHIC energy. In contrast saturation\n\u221a\nmodels [7] offer a justification for the predicted very weak sNN dependence of event\nmultiplicity.\nch\nFigure 1 presents predictions for pT spectra at midrapidity and NMF RPbPb\nof\n\u221a\ntotal inclusive charged hadrons for central (0-5%) Pb+Pb and p + p collisions at sNN\n\u03c00\n= 5.5 TeV. The predicted NMF RPbPb\nof neutral pions is also presented. From our\nmodel calculations we conclude that baryon/meson anomaly, will persist at the LHC\nwith a slight increase for increasing strength of the chromoelectric field (\u03ba = eef f E). A\nsomewhat higher sensitivity to \u03ba is obtained for NMF of identified particles [4].\nThe net-baryon rapidity distribution measured at RHIC is both qualitatively and\nquantitatively very different from those at lower energies indicating that a significantly\n\n\fStopping power from SPS to LHC\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. Left: HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 predictions for pT spectra at mid-rapidity of total\ninclusive charged hadrons for central (0-5%) Pb+Pb and p + p collisions. Right:\nPredicted nuclear modification factors for charged hadrons and for neutral pions.\n\ndifferent system is formed near mid rapidity [8]. Fig. 2 (left panel) presents the energy\ndependence of net-baryon at mid-rapidity per participant pair. Shown are the results for\ncentral (0-5%) Au+Au collisions, which indicate a net decrease with increasing energy.\nThis picture, corroborated with an increase of the ratio p\u0304/p to \u2248 1 suggests that the\nreaction at the LHC is more transparent in contrast to the situation at lower energy.\n\u221a\nFor central (0-5%) Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV, our prediction for net-baryon\nper participant pair is \u2248 0.065 with Npart = 398, assuming \u03ba = 5 GeV/fm. Similar\nvalues (open squares) are obtained within pQCD+hydro model [9]. However, this model\npredicts (Fig. 15 from ref. [9]) much steeper slopes of charged hadron pT spectra.\n\nFigure 2. Left: HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 predictions for net-baryon (per participant pair) at\n\u221a\nmid-rapidity as function of sNN . Right: Average rapidity loss versus beam rapidity.\nThe data and dashed line extrapolation are from ref. [8] and from BRAHMS [10]\n\n.\nIn our model the main mechanisms for baryon production are quark di-quark (q\u2212qq)\nstrings fragmentation and JJ\u0304 loops in which baryons are produced approximatively in\n\n\fStopping power from SPS to LHC\n\n3\n\npairs. The energy dependence is \u221d (s/s0 )\u22121/4+\u2206/2 similar with those predicted in ref.\n[2] (eq. 11) with the assumption that JJ\u0304 is a dominant mechanisms. This dependence\nis obtained if we choose for the parameters: s0 = 1 GeV2 the usual parameter of\nRegge theory, \u03b1(0) = 1/2 the reggeon (M0J ) intercept and \u03b1P (0) = 1 + \u2206 (where\n\u2206 \u2248 0.01) for the pomeron intercept. If confirmed, the measurements at LHC energies\nwill help us to determine better these values. In contrast, results from HIJING/BB\u0304\nv1.10 model [3] (star symbol) give a slow energy dependence with a higher pomeron\nintercept \u03b1P (0) = 1 + 0.08 and over-estimate the stopping in the entire energy region.\nBaryon conservation in the reactions can be used to predict rapidity loss and the\nenergy loss per baryon. The results are illustrated in Fig. 2 (right panel) for average\nrapidity loss < \u03b4y > defined as in ref. [1]. The predicted values for RHIC and LHC\nenergies, clearly depart from the linear extrapolation for constant relative rapidity loss\n\u221a\n[8], which seems to be valid only at lower energies ( sNN \u2264 20 GeV).\nThis work was partly supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil of Canada and by the U.
