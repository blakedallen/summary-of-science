INTRODUCTION\n\nThe emission from low-mass X-ray binaries in quiescence (qLMXBs) is routinely studied to provide useful\nconstraints on the physical models of the interior of neutron stars (NSs). The low luminosity (1032 \u20131033 erg s\u22121 ,\n4\u20135 orders of magnitude lower than the outburst luminosities) of these objects was first observed in the\npost-outburst stages of the transient LMXBs Cen X4 and Aql X-1 (van Paradijs et al. 1987), and initially\ninterpreted as a thermal blackbody emission powered\nby some low-level mass accretion onto the NS surface\n(Verbunt et al. 1994).\nIn an alternate explanation for the energy source of\nqLMXBs, the luminosity is provided by the energy released during accretion episodes by pressure-sensitive nuclear reactions (electron captures, neutron emission, and\npycnonuclear reactions) in the NS deep crust. The theory of deep crustal heating (DCH; Brown et al. 1998)\ndescribes how the accreted matter piles up at the top of\nthe NS surface, forcing the matter underneath to deeper\nlayers of the crust, and how the energy is deposited in\nthe crust. The resulting nuclear reaction chain releases\n\u223c 1.5 MeV per accreted nucleon (see Gupta et al. (2007)\nand Haensel & Zdunik (2008) for details about crustal\nheating models), and gives rise to a time-average luminosity directly proportional to the time-averaged accretion rate:\nhLi = 9\u00d71032\n\nQ\nh\u1e40 i\nerg s\u22121\n10\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 1.5 MeV amu\u22121\n(1)\n\nwhere Q is the average heat deposited in the NS crust\nper accreted nucleon.\nIt was also suggested that the observed thermal spectrum of qLMXBs is the result of the energy deposited\nin the crust, heating the NS core during outbursts and\nthermally re-radiating away from the crust through the\nNS atmosphere on core-cooling timescales (Brown et al.\n1998). It is thought that this atmosphere is composed of pure hydrogen since heavy elements gravitationally settle on short timescale (\u223c seconds, Romani\n1987; Bildsten et al. 1992) once the accretion from the\nlow-mass evolved companion star onto the NS surface\nshuts off after an outburst. Models of NS H atmosphere (Rajagopal & Romani 1996; Zavlin et al. 1996;\nMcClintock et al. 2004; Heinke et al. 2006), now routinely used for qLMXBs, imply emission-area radii consistent with the entire area of the NS, compared to\n<\nthe \u223c\n1 km emission-area radii in the previously imposed blackbody approximation (Rutledge et al. 1999).\nSpectral fitting of qLMXBs with such models also leads\nto the determination of the projected radius (as observed from infinity) defined by R\u221e = RNS gr\u22121 =\n\u0001\u22121/2\n, where RNS is the physRNS 1 \u2212 2GMNS /RNS c2\nical radius of the NS.\nIn the spectra of some qLMXBs in the field of the\nGalaxy (for example Cen X-4, Rutledge et al. 2001b, and\nAql X-1, Rutledge et al. 2001a), an additional powerlaw component, dominating the spectrum above 2 keV\nand unrelated to the H-atmosphere thermal emission,\nis observed. Proposed interpretations of this powerlaw tail include residual accretion onto the NS magnetosphere (Grindlay et al. 2001a; Cackett et al. 2005),\n\nElectronic address: guillots@physics.mcgill.ca, rutledge@physics.mcgill.ca\n\n\f2\nshock emission via the emergence of a magnetic field\n(Campana & Stella 2000), or an intrabinary shock between the winds from the NS and its companion star\n(Campana et al. 2004). However, recent analyses of the\nquiescent emission of LMXBs have shown that variations\nin the non-thermal component are correlated to the variations in the thermal component. This suggests the presence of a variable low-level accretion on the NS (for the\nLMXB XTE J1701\u2212462, Fridriksson et al. 2010, and for\nthe LMXB Cen X-4, Cackett et al. 2010).\nAnother characteristic of qLMXBs is the expected\nlack of strong variability on long or short timescales\nsince their emission is dominated by the thermal radiation from the interior of the NS. While the thermal component is not expected to display intensity\nvariability, other emission mechanisms (like those mentioned in the previous paragraph) may be responsible for intensity and spectral variations (Brown et al.\n1998). However, recent outburst episodes can generate variations in the quiescent thermal luminosity on\ndays to years timescales, as observed for the LMXB\nKS 1731-260 (Rutledge et al. 2002, following the models described in Ushomirsky & Rutledge 2001, see also\nBrown & Cumming 2009).\nThe DCH/H-atmosphere interpretation has been\napplied to a large number of historical transient LMXBs\nand provided R\u221e measurements from high signal-tonoise (S/N) spectra. The following list is, to the best of\nour knowledge, exhaustive: 4U 1608-522 (Rutledge et al.\n1999), 4U 2129+47 (Rutledge et al. 2000), Cen X-4\n(Campana et al. 2000; Rutledge et al. 2001b), Aql X-1\n(Rutledge et al. 2001a), KS 1731-260 (Rutledge et al.\n2002),\nXTE J2123\u2212058 (Tomsick et al. 2004),\nEXO 1747\u2212214 (Tomsick et al. 2005), MXB 1659\u221229\n(Cackett et al. 2006), 1M 1716\u2212315 (Jonker et al.\n2007a), 1H 1905+000 (Jonker et al. 2007b), 2S 1803\u2212245\n(Cornelisse et al. 2007), 4U 1730\u221222 (Tomsick et al.\n2007), EXO 0748\u2212676 (Degenaar et al. 2009), and\nXTE J1701\u2212462 (Fridriksson et al. 2010).\nHowever, the 10%\u201350% systematic uncertainty in the\ndistances to qLMXBs in the field directly affects the R\u221e\nmeasurement uncertainty. Obtaining precise constraints\non the dense matter equation of state (EoS) is the observational motivation for measuring the radii of NSs,\nrequiring \u223c 5% accuracy on R\u221e to be useful for this\npurpose (Lattimer & Prakash 2004; Steiner et al. 2010).\nThe known distances to globular clusters (GCs) and their\nexpected overabundances of X-ray binaries (Hut et al.\n1992) has motivated the search for qLMXBs in the core\nof GCs.\nThere are 26 GC qLMXBs spectrally identified so far\n(see Heinke et al. 2003 and Guillot et al. 2009 for two\ncomplementary lists). However, some of them have\npoorly constrained radius and temperature measurements. This can be due to low count statistics and/or a\nlarge amount of galactic absorption (for example NH =\n1.2\u00d71022 atoms cm\u22122 for the GC Terzan 5) in their direction which alters the low-energy end (0.1\u20131 keV) of the\nspectra where the H-atmosphere spectrum of qLMXBs\npeaks. Therefore, their identification is regarded as less\nsecure. Most qLMXBs in GCs have low-S/N spectra, and\ntherefore, have rather large uncertainties on their R\u221e\nmeasurements (\u223c 15% or more), precluding their use for\n\nTABLE 1\nChandra Observations of NGC 6397\nObs.\nID\n79\n2668\n2669\n7460\n7461\n\nStarting\nTime (TT)\n2000 Jul\n2002 May\n2002 May\n2007 Jul\n2007 Jun\n\n31\n13\n15\n16\n22\n\n15:31:33\n19:17:40\n18:53:27\n06:21:36\n21:44:15\n\nExposure\nTime (ks)\n48.34\n28.10\n26.66\n149.61\n87.87\n\nDetector\nACIS-I3 (FI)\nACIS-S3 (BI)\nACIS-S3 (BI)\nACIS-S3 (BI)\nACIS-S3 (BI)\n\nMode\nF\nF\nF\nVF\nVF\n\nNote. - All observations were performed with a 3.24104 s frame rate.\nTT refers to terrestrial time. FI and BI refer to front-illuminated and\nback-illuminated detectors, respectively.\n\nEoS constraints. So far, only a few qLMXBs (in \u03c9Cen,\nGendre et al. 2003a, in M13, Gendre et al. 2003b, and\nX7 in 47 Tuc, Heinke et al. 2006) have spectra with S/N\nhigh enough to provide useful constraints on the dense\nmatter EoS (Webb & Barret 2007; Steiner et al. 2010).\nThe close proximity of the globular cluster NGC 6397\n(d \u2248 2.5 kpc, Harris 1996; Hansen et al. 2007;\nStrickler et al. 2009), the moderately low galactic absorption1 (NH = 0.14\u00d71022 atoms cm\u22122 , noted NH,22 =\n0.14 hereafter) in its direction makes it a useful target\nfor the spectral identification of qLMXBs. The discovery observation of the qLMXB U24 2 in NGC 6397 provided modest constraints on the NS projected radius:\nR\u221e = 4.9+14\n\u22121 km (Grindlay et al. 2001b, Gr01 hereafter).\nThe proximity of U24 to the GC core requires the use\nof the Chandra X-ray Observatory's angular resolution\nto positionally and spectrally separate the qLMXB from\nother sources in the crowded GC core. U24 lies at\ndc = 6.8 rc \u2248 20\u2032\u2032 from the GC center (core radius\nrc = 0.05\u2032 and half-mass radius rHM = 2.33\u2032 , NGC 6397\nis a core-collapse cluster). The reported effective temperature of U24 was kTeff = 57\u201392 eV (90% confidence\ninterval, Gr01).\nThis paper presents the spectral and timing analyses\nof five archived deep Chandra-ACIS observations of U24,\nlocated in GC NGC 6397. These long exposures provide\nthe high-S/N data necessary to confirm the qLMXB classification of U24 by obtaining precise RNS estimation.\nThe lack of variability also supports this classification.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2\ndescribes the data reduction and the analyses. Section 3\npresents the results of the analyses. Section 4 provides a\ndiscussion of the results and Section 5 is a short conclusion.\n2.

The source detection and the data analysis are performed using the CIAO v4.1.1 package\n(Fruscione et al. 2006). The event files (level=1) are reprocessed with the latest calibration files from CALDB\nv4.1 (Graessle et al. 2007, with the latest effective area\n1 From http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/colden.jsp using the\nNRAO data (Dickey & Lockman 1990).\n2 The source name U24 was used in the discovery paper (Gr01)\nand will be used throughout this work.\n\n\fChandra observations of qLMXBs in NGC 6397\n\n3\n\nTABLE 2\nPosition of U24 in Chandra Observations of NGC 6397\nObs.

The positions reported previously (Grindlay et al.\n2001b, , noted Gr01) have been corrected for the Chandra systematic uncertainty (see details\nin Section 3.1).\n\nmaps, quantum efficiency maps, and gain maps), as recommended in the CIAO Analysis Thread \"Reprocessing\nData to Create a New Level=2 Event File\" to include the\nup-to-date CTI corrections (charge-transfer inefficiency).\nThe re-processed event files are analyzed including\ncounts in the 0.5\u20138.0 keV energy range. The full-chip\nlight curves do not show evidence of background flares in\nany of the five observations, allowing use of the full exposure time of each observation. The low flux of the source\nof interest, U24, allows neglecting pile-up; the count rate\nof \u223c 0.06 photons per frame corresponds to a pile-up\nfraction of less than 2% 3 .\nFor each observation (ObsID), the source detection is\nperformed with the CIAO wavdetect algorithm. An exposure map is created using the task mkexpmap prior to\nthe source detection. The wavdetect exposure threshold\nexpthresh is set to 0.1 and the wavelet detection scales\nare set to scales = \"1.0 2.0 4.0 8.0\". Thirty-five sources\nare detected (\u03c3 > 3) on the ObsID 2668, 37 sources on\nObsID 2669, 66 sources on ObsID 7460, 48 on ObsID\n7461, and 37 on the ACIS-I observation ObsID 79.\nThis paper is solely focused on radius measurement\nand timing analysis on the qLMXB U24. While the\nsource detection is performed over the whole ACIS chip,\nthe following analysis pertains only to the source U24.\nCounts are extracted with the CIAO script psextract\naround the source position in a circular region of radius 3\u2032\u2032 , which ensures that 98% of the enclosed energy fraction at 1 keV is included 4 . The closest detected source, located at 10.6\u2032\u2032 distance from U24, has\n21.6 counts (background subtracted) within 1.5\u2032\u2032 . It contributes to \u226a 0.04 contamination counts within the extraction radius of U24 (on the longest observation). The\nbackground is extracted from an annulus centered at the\nqLMXB position with inner radius 5\u2032\u2032 , and outer radius\n30\u2032\u2032 . Other detected sources within the background annulus are excluded with a 5\u2032\u2032 radius region, which eliminate 99.8% of source counts in the background region.\nFor the deepest observation (ObsID 7460), 15 counts\nfrom other sources are within the extracted background\n(which contains 6187 counts). In other words, these constraints ensure that \u223c 0.25% of the background counts\nare due to other sources. Finally, the extraction radius\n3 Chandra Observatory Proposer Guide v12.0, Figure 6.18, December 2009\n4 Chandra Observatory Proposer Guide v12.0, Figure 6.7, December 2009\n\n(containing 98% of the ECF) does not require to apply\na correction to the flux.\nFollowing the CIAO Science Thread \"Creating ACIS\nRMFs with mkacisrmf \", the response matrices files\n(RMFs) are recalculated prior to the spectral analysis\nsince the RMFs obtained from psextract are not suited\nfor ACIS observations with focal plane temperature of \u2013\n120\u25e6C (the usual mkrmf command does not use the latest\ncalibration available in the case of \u2013120\u25e6 C ACIS imaging\ndata). In addition, the ancillary response files (ARFs)\nare also recalculated using the energy grid of the newly\nobtained RMFs. Overall, the extracted spectra, together\nwith the RMFs and ARFs, are used for the spectral analysis. In those spectra, the effect of background counts\ncan be ignored. Indeed, in the worst case (for ObsID\n7460), the number of expected background events accounts for 2.4% of the total number of counts in the extracted region (78.0 background counts out of a total of\n3188 counts), so that the background is neglected for the\nspectral analysis.\n2.2. Spectral Analysis\n\nFor each of the five observations, two spectral files are\ncreated, one with unbinned events (for fitting with the\nCash-statistics, Cash 1979) and one with binning (for\nfitting with the \u03c72 -statistics). For the latter, the bin\nwidth in the 0.5\u20131.5 keV energy range matches the energy\nresolution of the ACIS-S3 chip, i.e., \u223c0.15 keV. Above\n1.5 keV, four wider bins (0.3 keV, 0.6 keV, and two 3 keV\nwide spectral bins) are created. In some cases of low\ncount statistics, the last 2 or 3 bins are grouped together\nto maintain a minimum of 20 counts per bin. The main\ncriterion for the creation of the spectral bins is the energy\nresolution of the detector, but the 20 counts minimum\nis imposed to ensure approximate Gaussian uncertainty\nin each bin. Such a binning avoids an artificially small\nreduced-\u03c72 , and conserves the validity of \u03c72 -statistics.\nSpectral fitting is performed with the software XSPEC\nv12.5.1 (Arnaud 1996) using the publicly available model\nof NS H-atmosphere nsatmos (McClintock et al. 2004;\nHeinke et al. 2006). The model assumes non-magnetic\nNSs and has been computed for a range of surface gravity g = (0.1 \u2212 10)\u00d71014 cm s\u22122 . For the normalization\nparameter, nsatmos uses the emitting fraction of the NS\nsurface. It is kept fixed to unity in this work; in other\nwords, the whole NS surface emits. The distance parameter is held fixed as well at the value of NGC 6397,\n\n\f2.3. Variability Analysis\n\nFor each of the five observations, we perform two analyses to search for source variability on timescales shorter\nthan the duration of the observations, and one analysis\nfor timescales spanning the time between the first and\nlast observations.\nPower Density Spectrum (PDS). The data from\neach observation were binned into a discrete light curve,\nwith time bin size equal to the time resolution used in\nthe observation (\u2206T = 3.24104 s). A standard fastFourier transform (FFT) of the discrete data into frequency space was produced (Press et al. 1995), using\nan open-source FFT algorithm (Frigo & Johnson 1998).\nThis produced a Fourier transform of the data, covering\nthe frequency range 1/T \u2212 0.15427 Hz, where T is the duration of the observation, and 0.15427 Hz is the Nyquist\nfrequency, with discrete frequency resolution 1/T , and a\ntotal of N/2 frequency bins, where N = T /\u2206T is the\nnumber of time bins in the light curve. The resulting\nFourier transform was then converted into a PDS, where\nthe power Pj in each frequency bin j is Pj = a2j + b2j ,\nwhere aj and bj are the real and imaginary parts of the\nFourier component associated with a frequency fj = j/T ,\nproducing a PDS. The data were then normalized according to a standard prescription for analyses (Leahy et al.\n1983).\nShort-Timescale (<1 day) Variability. Shortterm variability in each ObsID is assessed by visual inspection of the five sources light curves. In addition,\na Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K-S) test (Press et al. 1995) is\nperformed to quantify the consistency of the temporal\ndistribution of counts in each observation with a constant\ncount rate. More specifically, the integrated-count light\ncurve is compared to a linear distribution using a K-S\ntest. A low K-S probability would indicate that the integrated light curve is significantly different from a linear\ndistribution, demonstrating the presence of variability on\nthe timescale of the observation.\nLong-Timescale (\u223cmonths-years) flux variability. Long-term variability is investigated to determine if\nthe flux remained constant over the course of the five observations, between 2000 and 2007. This is performed by\nadding a multiplicative constant parameter to the spectral model, and by fitting the five spectra simultaneously.\nThe constant is kept fixed at a value c = 1 for one spectrum (ObsID 79) and as a free and untied parameter\nfor the remaining four spectra while the remaining spectral parameters (NH , RNS , kTeff ) are assumed to be the\nsame across all observations. Best-fit c values statistically consistent with unity would demonstrate that the\nsource flux remained constant on the timescale of the five\nobservations.\n\n0.01\n\n10\u22123\n\n10\u22124\n\n10\u22125\n2\n\n\u03c7\n\nd = 2.5 kpc (Hansen et al. 2007; Strickler et al. 2009).\nThe NS mass is assumed to be 1.4 M\u2299 . Finally, the galactic absorption is taken into account using the phabs multiplicative model, with NH , the hydrogen column density\nparameter, set to NH,22 = 0.14. The errors on the bestfit parameters (RNS , kTeff ) are calculated using the command error in XSPEC with 90% confidence or using the\ncommand steppar. Confidence contours in mass\u2013radius\nspace are obtained with the steppar command with both\nthe mass and the radius as free parameters. The results\nof the spectral analysis are presented in Section 3.2.\n\nnormalized counts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n1\n\n2\nEnergy (keV)\n\n5\n\nFig. 1.- Folded spectra of all five Chandra-ACIS observations\nof U24 in NGC 6397, in the 0.5\u20138.0 keV energy range. Each color\ncorresponds to the spectra of each observations: ObsID 79 in black,\nObsID 2668 in red, ObsID 2669 in green, ObsID 7460 in blue, ObsID 7461 in cyan blue [See the electronic edition of the paper for\na color version of this figure]. The solid lines are the best-fitting\nmodel of an NS H-atmosphere model: NSATMOS, with NH,22 = 0.14\nand MNS = 1.4 M\u2299 kept frozen. The spectral binning was performed in accordance with the Chandra energy resolution (see Section 2.2). The fit is statistically acceptable with \u03c72\u03bd /dof (prob.) =\n1.49/45 (0.02). The residuals, shown in the lower part, indicate\nevidence of a count deficiency between 0.8 keV and 1.2 keV (see\nFigure 2 and Section 3.2), as well as an apparent excess of counts\nat large energy, above 2.5 keV, which is fit with a power-law component with \u03b1 = 1 to estimate the contribution to the total flux\n(see Section 3.2).\n\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. Positional Analysis\n\nThe position of the source reported in the discovery observation (ObsID 79) is R.A.=17h 40m 41.421s and\ndecl. = \u221253\u25e6 40\u2032 04.73\u2032\u2032 (Gr01). The authors corrected\nfor the systematic Chandra uncertainty in the pointing (0.6\u2032\u2032 ) by cross-identifying cataclysmic variables on\nChandra and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. The positional uncertainty on the source is subarcseconds and consists in the residual error from the\ncorrection and the statistical uncertainty from the detection algorithm.\nFor comparison, the source detection in all five observations presented here led to the positions listed in Table 2.\nIt is concluded that the position of U24 is consistent with\nthat reported previously, within the 0.6\u2032\u2032 Chandra systematic uncertainty. No correction for the systematic\nuncertainty is performed here since the identification of\nU24 is free of source confusion and since the purpose of\nthis paper focuses on the spectral analysis.\n3.2. Spectral Analysis\nThe spectral analysis is performed using the Cashstatistics on the unbinned data (neglecting the background) and using \u03c72 -statistics on the grouped data. Results are presented in Table 3, listing the best-fit parameters for Cash and \u03c72 -statistics, freezing and thawing NH .\nAll reported errors are 90% confidence. The \u03c72 -statistics\nnull hypothesis probability confirms the viability of the\nfitted model while the Cash-statistics assumes that the\nmodel describes the data. Nonetheless, the use of Cashstatistics provides smaller uncertainties on the best-fit\nparameters, specifically for the NS radius measurements.\nA simultaneous fit is also performed using all five spec-\n\n\fChandra observations of qLMXBs in NGC 6397\n\n5\n\nTABLE 3\nSpectral Parameters of U24 in Chandra Observations of NGC 6397\nObs.

NH,22 is the galactic absorption NH in units of\n22\n10\natoms cm\u22122 . Values in parentheses are held fixed for the spectral fits and quoted uncertainty are 90% confidence . FX is the\nunabsorbed flux in units of 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.5\u201310 keV range. The uncertainties on the fluxes were only calculated for the\nfixed-NH fits. For ObsID 7460, the \u03c72 value greater than 2 prevents XSPEC to directly estimate the error region. It was obtained using\nthe command steppar. \"PL contrib.\" refers to the upper limit of a power-law component contribution to the total flux (see Section 3.2).\nThe percent in parenthesis following the Cash-statistic value indicates the goodness-of-fit. The best fit parameters and the statistics\ninformation provided do not include the power-law component.\n\ntra, therefore increasing the count statistics and providing better constraints on the best-fit parameters (Figure 1). Prior to that, the source long-term variability is\ninspected, as described in Section 2.3. The best-fit values (with Cash-statistic) for the multiplicative constants\n+0.09\ndescribed in Section 2.3 are c = 1.02+0.09\n\u22120.10 , c = 1.04\u22120.10 ,\n+0.06\n+0.07\nc = 0.92\u22120.07 , and c = 0.95\u22120.08, for the observations\nObsID 2668, ObsID 2669, ObsID 7460, and ObsID 7461,\nrespectively, and c = 1 (fixed) for ObsID 79. All bestfit values are statistically consistent with unity (within\n1.5\u03c3), indicating that the source flux did not vary on\nlong-term timescale. This allows for simultaneous spectral fitting with the constant multiplier fixed at the value\nc = 1 for all five spectra.\nThe upper limit of a power-law contribution to the\ntotal flux is also estimated. To do so, a power-law component with fixed photon index \u03b1 = 1 is added to the NS\natmosphere model and the flux of this component using\nthe upper limit of the power-law normalization parameter is measured. It is found that the power-law contribution accounts for \u2264 3.7% of the total flux (90% confidence\nupper limit), when estimated from the simultaneous fits.\nUpper limits on the contribution of a power-law component for the individual spectra are also indicated in\nTable 3.\nThere is some evidence for a count deficiency between\n\n0.8 and 1.2 keV on ObsID 7460 given the assumed spectrum and instrument calibration (see Figure 2). We\nparameterize this apparent dip in the spectrum with\na notch component. The best-fit notch central energy is E = 0.96+0.03\n\u22120.02 keV, and the best-fit width is\nW = 42 \u00b1 17 eV. The added component improves the\nstatistics, \u03c72\u03bd /dof (prob.) = 1.35/6 (0.23), without altering the best fit NS temperature and radius.\nWe also investigate the statistical significance of this\ndeficiency. Using the method described in a previous\nwork (Rutledge & Sako 2003), we estimate the probability of observing such a deviation from a continuum\nmodel. First, the observed spectrum is convolved with\nthe energy redistribution of the ACIS-S detector. Then,\nusing a Monte Carlo approach, it is shown that the convolved spectrum does not exceed the 99% confidence limits envelope obtained from 10,000 simulated spectra (Figure 3). They were created using the best-fit nsatmos\nmodel (RNS = 8.9 km, kTeff = 80 eV, MNS = 1.4,\nd = 2.5 kpc, and NH,22 = 0.14, see Table 3). The maximum deviation corresponds to a 98.2% confidence, which\ndoes not constitute sufficient evidence to claim the detection of an absorption line, but which should be investigated in more details with higher S/N observations.\nFor completeness, the results of spectral fits with other\nmodels are provided.

Variability Analyses\n\nWe find no evidence of broadband variability as a\nfunction of frequency in the PDS. For broadband variability, uncertainties were assigned to each frequency\nbin equal to the square root of the theoretical variance in the power, appropriate to the assumed normalization (Leahy et al. 1983), and derived 90% confidence\n(2\u03c3) upper-limits on the root-mean-square (rms) variability. The data were then rebinned logarithmically\nand the resulting PDS were fit with a model of a constant power 5 , plus a power-law component in which the\npower scales Pj \u221d fj\u2212\u03b1 , and the power-law slope was\nheld fixed at \u03b1 = 1. This model was fit to the data using a Levenberg\u2013Marquardt \u03c72 minimization technique\n(Press et al. 1995), to find the best-fit model parameters. The resulting 90% confidence upper limits on\nthe broadband variability, in a frequency range 0.0001\u2013\n0.10 Hz (used for each observation, to ease comparison\nof limits, although the longer observations are sensitive\nto variability at frequencies below this range) and across\nthe full Chandra/ACIS energy range (0.5\u20138.0 keV) were\n: < 12% (ObsID 79), \u03c72\u03bd =0.63 (26 dof); < 19% (ObsID\n2668), \u03c72\u03bd =1.5 (27 dof);< 11% (ObsID 2669), \u03c72\u03bd =1.32\n(26 dof); <6.4% (ObsID 7460), \u03c72\u03bd =0.98 (15 dof); <8.6%\n(ObsID 7461), \u03c72\u03bd =0.98 (9 dof).\n5 The constant accounts for the expected Poisson noise power\nin the PDS, which is approximately 2 in the PDS normalization\nused; however, we observed the Poisson level for each of the PDS\nto be suppressed, to a value of \u223c 1.9, due to instrumental deadtime effects. To correct for this, on average, in the rms variability\nupper limits derived here, the measured rms limits were increased\nby a factor hAi/2.0, where hAi is the best-fit Poisson power level.\n\nWe find no evidence of periodic variability. For ObsIDs 79, 2668, 2669, 7460, and 7461 respectively, we find\nmaximum (normalized) powers of Pmax =21.8, 17.0, 15.3,\n17.7, and 23.7 which, with a number of frequency bins\nof 7526, 4383, 4154, 23072, and 13812, correspond to respective probabilities of chance occurrence in all cases of\n>10%.\nVisual inspection of the light curves did not reveal any\nvariation in the source count rates. Short-term variability was also investigated in a more quantitative way by\ncomparing the integrated ligthcurve with a linear distribution. None of the five observations showed an integrated light curve significantly different from a linear\ndistribution. More specifically, the calculated K-S probabilities were 65% (ObsID 79), 62% (ObsID 2668), 95%\n(ObsID 2669), 51% (ObsID 7460) and 16% (ObsID 7461).\nTherefore, we find no evidence of intensity variability on\nthe timescale of the integration times, i.e., <\n\u223c 1 day.\n4. DISCUSSION\n4.1. R\u221e Calculation\nProducing realistic constraints on the dEoS requires\nobtaining values of R\u221e relying on as few assumptions\nas possible. Keeping the mass fixed for the model fitting is therefore not appropriate for that purpose. We\nestimate the value of R\u221e by permitting MNS to vary,\nand calculating the contours of constant model probability resulting from the fits in a mass\u2013radius space (Figure 4). This is done using the steppar command in\nXSPEC. The 90% confidence regions of RNS and MNS\nare obtained from the 90%-contour in the mass\u2013radius\n+0.47\nspace: RNS = 9.7+0.9\n\u22120.8 km and MNS = 1.13\u22120.32 M\u2299 .\nThe best-fit value of the projected radius is therefore\nR\u221e = 11.9 km. The calculation of the uncertainties is\ncomplicated by the fact that the distribution of RNS and\nMNS is not symmetric around the best-fit values (i.e.,\nnot Gaussian). Moreover, RNS and MNS are highly correlated, as shown by the crescent shape of the contour in\nM-R space (Figure 4). Therefore, the calculation of the\nuncertainties on R\u221e using Gaussian normal error propagation is not valid. We describe two methods to obtain\nthe uncertainty on R\u221e .\nThe projected radius and its uncertainties can be ob-\n\n\fChandra observations of qLMXBs in NGC 6397\n\ncertainties intrinsic to the model used, systematic and\nstatistical uncertainties. In those references where these\nuncertainties are discussed (for example, Heinke et al.\n2006), only two of the three uncertainties we discuss here\n(distance and detector systematics) are addressed. No\nwork that we can find in the literature discusses the impact of the uncertainty in the spectral model on derived\nmodel parameters; therefore, we do so here.\n\n1\n\n+\n\n0.5\n\nParameter: Mns (Msun)\n\n1.5\n\nmin = 1.291653e+03; Levels = 1.293953e+03 1.296263e+03 1.300863e+03\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\nParameter: Rns (km)\n\n7\n\n11\n\n12\n\nFig. 4.- Contour plot in mass\u2013radius space resulting from the\nsimultaneous fit of the five data sets with the NSATMOS model. The\n67%, 90%, and 99% contours are shown, and the cross indicates\nthe best fit (when both the mass and the radius are free to vary).\nFor an NS mass of 1.4 M\u2299 , the range of RNS corresponds to that\nobtained and quoted in Section 3.2.\n\ntained from a tabulated version of the nsa spectral\nmodel (Zavlin et al. 1996). However, this model (or nsa)\nis less adapted than the nsatmos or nsagrav models\n(Webb & Barret 2007) because it was calculated for a\nsingle value of the surface gravity g = 2.43\u00d71014 cm s\u22122\nwhile the other two models consider a range of values. Nevertheless, the best-fit R\u221e value with this model\nis: R\u221e = 12.1+1.5\n\u22120.9 km (consistent with the value calculated in the previous paragraph), for a temperature\n2\nkTeff = 76+2\n\u22123 eV (\u03c7\u03bd /dof (prob.) = 1.54/44 (0.02)).\nA second method to estimate the uncertainties involves geometric construction, by reading graphically the\nerror region of R\u221e on the M-R contours (Figure 4).\nFor that, we choose to use the line of constant surface gravity (i.e., constant M (R)) that goes through\nthe point (R, M ) = (0 km, 0 M\u2299 ) and the point of best\nfit in M-R space. This line intersects the 90% contour at the points (R, M ) = (9.048 km, 1.045 M\u2299) and\n(R, M ) = (10.39 km, 1.245 M\u2299). These two points correspond to the values R\u221e = 11.15 km and R\u221e = 12.92 km\nwhich are, respectively, estimates of the lower and upper\n90% confidence uncertainties on R\u221e , assuming a constant value of the surface gravity.\nTherefore, the projected radius and its estimated 90%\nconfidence uncertainties are: R\u221e = 11.9+1.0\n\u22120.8 km. With\nthe achieved uncertainty, U24 becomes the third best\nradius measurement of a NS among the population of GC\nqLMXBs, after the ones in \u03c9Cen (Gendre et al. 2003a)\nand in M13 (Gendre et al. 2003b).\n4.2. Error budget\n\nThe high S/N spectra and the precise radius measurements obtained in the work presented here can be used to\nconstrain the EoS of dense matter. A high precision on\nthe NS radius is mandatory to exclude some of the existing nuclear dense matter EoSs and provide the necessary\nconstraints to understand the behavior of such matter.\nHowever, other sources of error come into play in this\ntype of measurements. To quantify the total uncertainty\non the radius measurement presented here, we estimate\nthe contribution of each source of error into an error budget, including the distance to the GC NGC 6397, un-\n\n\u2022 The distance to the GC was recently measured using two independent methods. The analysis of the\nCO white dwarf (WD) sequence from deep observations in an outer field of NGC 6397 led to a distance\nof 2.54\u00b10.07 kpc (Hansen et al. 2007). More recently, using CO WDs in central regions of the cluster, the distance was calculated to be 2.34\u00b10.13 kpc\n(Strickler et al. 2009). The weighted mean of these\ntwo measurements is 2.50\u00b10.06 kpc, corresponding to a 2.4% uncertainty. The unknown line-ofsight position of U24 within NGC 6397 accounts\nfor < 0.1% of the distance uncertainty, which can\nbe neglected compared to the GC distance uncertainty.\n\u2022 The calculation of spectral model NSATMOS also\ncontributes to the total uncertainty on the measured radius. However, the previous works describing the model do not provide a discussion\non the fractional uncertainties in intensity due to\nconvergence during the calculation of the spectral\nmodel (McClintock et al. 2004; Heinke et al. 2006).\nTherefore, it is not possible to evaluate the errors of\nthe resulting spectra. The cited reference for similar models (NSA and NSAGRAV, Zavlin et al. 1996)\nonly provides information on the temperature calculation convergence, which does not permit an estimation of the uncertainty error in the modeled\nintensity as a function of energy.\n\u2022 The statistical uncertainties are those quoted in\nTable 3 (90% confidence). This includes the 3%\nsystematic uncertainty of the detector calibration,\ntaken into account using the \"systematic 0.03\"\ncommand in XSPEC.\nConsequently, the distance uncertainty (2.4%) is the\nonly quantifiable error not taken into account in the radius measurement obtained from spectral fitting. It is\ntherefore added in quadrature to the systematic and statistical uncertainties to obtain the total quantifiable uncertainty in the radius measurement. For example, the\nupper bound uncertainty limit of RNS was 10.1% and\nis 10.4% when accounting for the distance uncertainty.\nThe lower bound uncertainty limit was 6.7% and becomes\n7.1%. Consequently, the physical radius is RNS = 8.9+0.9\n\u22120.6\n(for MNS = 1.4 M\u2299) while the estimated radiation radius is R\u221e = 11.9+1.0\n\u22120.8 km, when considering the sources\nof uncertainty listed above. In conclusion, in NGC 6397,\nthe distance uncertainty of NGC 6397 alone minimally\naffects the current uncertainty on the radius measurement.\n4.3. Core temperature calculation\n\n\f8\nThe best-fit temperature and physical radius of the NS\ncan be used to determine the interior temperature. This\ncalculation is model dependent and due to the uncertainties in the deep atmosphere composition (the depth\nof the H/He transition in particular), two different models are considered here. The first one assumes a layer of\nhelium down to a column depth y = 1\u00d7109 g cm\u22122 with\na pure layer of iron underneath. The second model considers a thin layer of He down to y = 1\u00d7104 g cm\u22122 with\na mixture dominated by rp-processes. These two alternatives take into account the extremal values for the core\ntemperature, for a fixed effective temperature.\nThe calculation, described in a previous work\n(Brown et al. 2002), was performed with a fixed mass\nMNS = 1.4 M\u2299 and a fixed radius RNS = 8.9 km, which\ncorresponds to the best-fit value. The effective temperature used was kTeff = 80+4\n\u22125 eV. The calculation is performed down to a column depth of 1\u00d71014 g cm\u22122 , since\nthe temperature is nearly isothermal in deeper layers.\nFor the first model, the resulting interior \u0001tempera7\nture (at y = 1014 g cm\u22122 ) is Tcore = 3.37+0.36\n\u22120.41 \u00d710 K.\nThe second model leads to \u0001the value of interior tem7\nperature Tcore = 8.98+0.81\n\u22120.98 \u00d710 K. Overall, if it is\nassumed that the H/He transition depth is unknown,\nthe core temperature is in the range of extreme values:\nTcore = (3.0 \u2212 9.8) \u00d7107 K.\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have performed the spectral analysis of five\narchived Chandra observations of the qLMXBs in the GC\nNGC 6397. The \u223c 350 ks of integration time available\npermitted to obtain high S/N spectra and improve the\nradius measurement. More specifically, the simultaneous\nspectral fitting of all five observations, using an NS H atmosphere, allowed us to provide constraints on the NS radius with \u223c10% statistical uncertainty (90% confidence).\nThis confirmed the qLMXB nature of the X-ray source.\nTherefore, the measured NS properties are RNS =\n+4\n8.9+0.9\n\u22120.6 km and kTeff = 80\u22125 eV, for MNS = 1.4 M\u2299 , and\nassuming an NS with an atmosphere composed of pure\nhydrogen. The estimated interior temperature lies in\nthe range Tcore = (3.0 \u2212 9.8) \u00d7107 K. In the 0.5\u201310 keV\nrange, the flux corresponding to these best-fit parameters\n\n\u0001\n\u221213\nis FX = 1.39+0.02\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , equivalent to\n\u22120.06 \u00d710\n\u0001\n+0.01\na luminosity of LX = 1.04\u22120.05 \u00d71032 erg s\u22121 at a distance of 2.5 kpc. The spectra did not show evidence for\na power-law component as inferred by the upper limit on\nthe contribution to the total flux of 3.7%.\nThe results of this analysis were consistent with those\nof the discovery observation (Gr01); the reported NS\nradius and temperature were R\u221e = 4.9+14\n\u22121 km and\nkTeff = 57\u201392 eV. No optical counterpart was detected\non the HST observations, with a limiting magnitude of\nMV > 11 (Gr01).\nNo variability was observed on long timescales. Therefore, unless an outburst (for which there is no evidence)\nhappened between the observations\u2013between 2000 and\n2002, or between 2002 and 2007\u2013we conclude that the\nsource remained in its quiescent stage since the discovery observation. It is worth noting that none of the\nGC qLMXBs discovered in quiescence so far have been\nseen in outburst. Moreover, an outburst happening between the available observations would have had an impact on the observed luminosity and intensity variability would have been detected (Ushomirsky & Rutledge\n2001; Rutledge et al. 2002).\nThe search of shorttimescale variability (< 1 day) did not reveal any such\nvariability. Finally, a PDS analysis was performed and\ndid not demonstrate evidence of periodic variability in\nthe frequency range 0.0001\u20130.10 Hz. The lack of intensity variability on various timescales further supports the\nclassification of the source.\nIn conclusion, the qLMXB U24 in the GC NGC 6397\nadds to the list of qLMXBs suitable to place constraints\non the dense matter EoSs with a best-fit projected radius\nof R\u221e = 11.9+1.0\n\u22120.8 km.\nR.E.R. is supported by an NSERC Discovery\ngrant.\nE.B. is supported by NASA/ATFP grant\nNNX08AG76G.
