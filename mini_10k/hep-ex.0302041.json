Introduction\nWe have evaluated the 64-channel Multianode\nPhoto Multiplier (MaPMT) as a candidate photo\ndetector for the LHCb Ring Imaging Cherenkov\n(RICH) counters. The MaPMT contains a 8x8\narray of 64 dynode chains enclosed in a single vacuum envelope. The window is made of UV glass\ninstead of borosilicate which extends the transparency down to 200 nm. According to the manufacturer, the bi-alkali photo cathode has a quantum efficiency of 22% at a wavelength of 380 nm.\nThe pitch between anode pixels is 2.3 mm. When\naccounting for the inactive 0.2 mm gaps between\npixels, the MaPMT has an active area coverage\nof only 38%. The full angular coverage with 85%\nactive area can be restored by mounting a fused\nsilica lens with one flat and one spherical surface\nwith a radius of curvature of 25 mm in front of\nthe tube. The lens has a demagnification factor\nof about two-third and focuses the incoming photons onto the sensitive area of the MaPMT.\n2. Test Beam Results\nThe sensitivity of the MaPMT to Cherenkov\nphotons has been tested with particle beams of\n120 GeV/c pions at the SPS accelerator at CERN.\nA detailed account of these tests is described in\n\nreference [1]. Here we present the main results. A\n3x3 cluster of closely packed MaPMTs has been\nmounted onto a prototype of the RICH 1 detector\nfor the LHCb experiment. The radiator gas was\nCF4 at a pressure of 700 mbar and the photo\ncathode was set at -1000 V. To demonstrate that\nthe MaPMTs will work at the LHC the data were\nrecorded with the APVm chip running at 40 MHz.\n\nFigure 1. Cherenkov ring measured with the\nMaPMT array with (right plot) and without\nlenses (left plot) mounted in front of the tubes.\n\nIn Figure 1 we show the results for two runs of\n6000 events each, one with and one without the\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 2.

The vertical line indicates the 5\u03c3 cut above\npedestal.\n\nbre which could be moved with respect to the\nMaPMT by semi-automated optical stages. Two\nread-out systems were employed. One is the 40\nMHz read-out with the APVm chip also used for\nthe beam tests, and another one is based on CAMAC amplifiers and ADCs.\nIn addition to the nine tubes studied with test\nbeams we obtained two more MaPMTs which, according to the manufacturer, have an increased\nquantum efficiency of maximum 25 - 27% at\n360 nm. The focusing of these new tubes has\nbeen improved. Firstly, the acceptance at the\noutside edges of the active area of the MaPMT\nhas been increased, and another focusing wire\nhas been added. Secondly, the distance between\nthe focusing grid and the entry slits to the dynode chain has been reduced. We have studied\nthese new MaPMTs with a LED light scan. The\ndata have been taken by moving the light source\nin steps of 0.1 mm along the front face of the\nMaPMT, with the photocathode at -900 V. The\n\nsignal-pedestal [ADC]\n\nlenses mounted in front of the MaPMTs. In both\ncases, a ring of Cherenkov photons is clearly visible. The ratio of yields with and without lenses\nis 1.55 as is expected from a simulation. With\nthe lenses the full Cherenkov ring is captured\nwhich demonstrates that MaPMTs can be closely\npacked to restore full geometrical acceptance. We\nobserve 6.96 \u00b1 0.33 photo electrons per event, in\nvery good agreement with the simulation. The\ncorresponding figure of merit for a RICH detector is N0 = 110 \u00b1 7 cm\u22121 .

The\ndata were corrected as follows. A common-mode\nbaseline has been subtracted and signals due to\ncross-talk stemming from the read-out electronics have been removed. We clearly distinguish\nbetween the pedestal peak and the signal containing mainly one photo electron. Overlaid is a fit\nwhere \u03bb is the mean number of photo electrons.\n3.

The gain is proportional\nto s and the collection efficiency is closely related\nto \u03bb. We observe that the edge pixels have a\nlarger acceptance for the new MaPMT (solid histograms) with respect to the standard focusing\ntube (dashed histograms). Due to the improved\nfocusing, both the gain and the collection efficiency are more homogeneous.\nMost front-end chips developed for the LHC\nhave been optimised for signals from Silicon sensors or micro-strip gas chambers with a charge of\n26000 - 40000 e. At a voltage of 800 V between\nanode and photocathode the gain of the MaPMT\nis around 300000 which is about 10 times higher.\nTo make use of one of these front-end chips for\nthe the MaPMT a gain adaptation is needed. The\npreferred solution is to modify a preamplifier to\na lower gain. A second possibility is to make use\nof an attenuator network. This has been used\nfor the APVm read-out by means of an AC coupler. However this approach suffers from cross\ntalk problems. A third way that we have investigated is the feasibility to run the MaPMTs at a\nlower gain.\nTo reduce the gain of the MaPMT we have\nchanged the values of the resistors between the\nphoto cathode, the first, second and the third\ndynode, respectively. The basic idea is to keep\nthe gain at the first dynode while lowering the\noverall gain. The values for the default, a medium\nand a low gain option are given in Table 1. The\nsignal width is mainly due to the Poisson distribution for multiplication at the first dynode and\ncan be estimated as g1 = s2 /\u03c3 2 where \u03c3 is the\nGaussian width of the single photon signal. Using the CAMAC read-out we have measured the\noverall gain of the MaPMT for a center and a\nborder pixel as a function of the high voltage for\nthe three different resistor chains. In Figure 4\ntop) we plot s as a function of the applied high\nvoltage for the three different resistor chains. At\na given voltage the gain of the MaPMT reduces\nby a factor of four for the low gain option. In the\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n10\n\n2\n\n(gain) signal [ADC]\n\nFigure 4. High voltage scan for three different\nresistor chains. Top) Average single photon pulse\nheight s versus high voltage. Bottom) Gain at\nthe first dynode g1 = s2 /\u03c3 2 versus s.\n\nbottom plot we plot g1 = s2 /\u03c3 2 as a function of\ns. As expected we observe that g1 increases with\ns. However there are no differences between the\ndifferent resistor chains. We have repeated these\nmeasurements with the APVm read-out and the\nresults agree.\nWe have studied the loss of signal below the\nthreshold cut of 5 \u03c3ped where \u03c3ped is the Gaussian\nwidth of the pedestal peak. We have employed\ndifferent fit methods. Besides a Gaussian signal\nshape we have implemented a fit which uses a\nPoisson distribution for the first two photo electrons [2]. This method also allows for photons\nwhich pass through the photo cathode to be converted into photo electrons at the first dynode.\nA Gaussian or a Poisson fit to the pulse height\nspectra are inadequate to describe the region of\nsmall signals close to the pedestal. In Figure 5\nwe show a pulse height spectra recorded with the\nCAMAC read-out and the photo cathode at -900\nV. The superimposed fit (dotted line) allows for\n\n\f4\nTable 1\n\u0002\n\u0003\nResistances in 102 k\u03a9 in front of each dynode.\n\nEntries / [ADC Count]\n\nDynode\nStandard gain\nMedium gain\nLow gain\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n3\n4\n4\n\n2\n2\n2\n3\n\n3\n2\n2\n3\n\n4\n1\n1\n1\n\n5\n1\n1\n1\n\n6\n1\n1\n1\n\n7\n1\n1\n1\n\n8\n1\n1\n1\n\n9\n1\n1\n1\n\n10\n1\n1\n1\n\n11\n1\n1\n1\n\n12\n2\n2\n2\n\nAnode\n5\n5\n5\n\ntions whereas the Gaussian and Poisson fit give\nK1 \u2265 g1 = 3.2 and K1 = 4.1, respectively. The\nparameter \u03bb is independent of the fit method.\nDue to gain variations for pixels within a tube\nthe loss of signal below the threshold varies from\npixel to pixel. Using the Poisson fit including\nthe \"1st dynode\" effect gives the most reliable\nresults. The average signal loss of the 64 pixels\nof an MaPMT is 13%. We have also measured\nthat the signal loss below threshold scales with\ns. Consequently, running at lower gains increases\nthis loss.\n\n10\n\n4.

There is a broad additional contribution of small pulse heights, but no\nevidence for a second peak in the data. Including\na contribution due to production of photo electrons at the first dynode improves the description\nof the data. However, the fit improves the overall description of the data and, for the spectrum\nshown above, yields a gain at the first dynode of\nK1 = 6.1 which is in agreement with expecta-\n\nThe APVm read-out is not compatible with the\nLHCb architecture.

The binary mode\nhas several advantages, as it ties in better with\nthe Pixel HPD development for LHCb, described\nin reference [3], which also has a binary readout, and for which a design of the Off-Detector\nElectronics (ODE) is underway. In addition there\nwould be substantial cost savings.\nA program has been undertaken to develop a\nBeetle adaptation to the MaPMT. By adding a\ncharge and a voltage attenuator at the input of\nthe preamplifier we have lowered the gain of the\nBeetle chip. Test structures have been produced\nand studied for this design. For the charge attenuator, measurements with a test charge agree\nvery well with the simulation. The dynamic range\nof the preamplifier is 10 photo electrons. This\npreamplifier has been mounted onto a MaPMT\nand a pulse height spectrum from an LED light\nsource has been measured. The signal from\nmostly single photo electrons is nicely separated\nfrom the pedestal. In this approach the load ca-\n\n\f5\n\n5. Magnetic Field Studies\nA consequence of the optimisation of the LHCb\nspectrometer [3] is that now the RICH 1 photo detectors will be placed in a region where the magnetic field strength is about 40 mT. We have studied the sensitivity of the MaPMT to longitudinal\nand transverse magnetic fields up to B = 35 mT.\nA set-up with 4 LEDs has been built to allow for\na diffuse illumination of the MaPMT. The APVm\nread-out system was used.\nWe observe that the gain and the collection efficiency of a MaPMT decreases with increasing B\nfield. At B = 3 mT, this effect is already sizable\nfor the two edge rows of the tube. Averaged for\nall pixels of a tube the number of measured photo\nelectrons for B \u2265 3 mT is below 90% of that measured at 0 mT. The MaPMT can be shielded by\nenclosing it laterally with a \u03bc-metal case. This\nshielding should extend beyond the photo cathode of the tube. In Figure 6 we show the measured number of photo electrons for all pixels of a\nMaPMT relative to its value at 0 mT for the following set-ups: No shielding, 0.9 mm thick shielding extending by 13 mm and 20 mm, and 1.8 mm\nthick shielding extending by 13 mm and 20 mm.\nWe observe that the shielding of the tube is effective. Already for the single 0.9 mm thick shielding\nthe MaPMT functions in longitudinal magnetic\nfields up to 10 mT. We have also studied the behaviour of the MaPMT in transverse fields. These\nmeasurements show that the MaPMT is insensitive to transverse magnetic fields up to 25 mT.\n6. Conclusions\nUsing particle beams at the SPS at CERN we\nhave successfully tested a 3x3 array of multianode\nphotomultiplier tubes. We have demonstrated\nthat by means of lenses mounted in front of the\nclosely packed MaPMTs the Cherenkov photons\nare focused onto the sensitive area of the devices. Using a laboratory with LED light sources\nwe have studied the performance and the signal\n\nTotal Number of Entries against field\n# of entries\n\npacitance affects the gain which would require to\nkeep the input capacitances of all channels within\na few pF.\n\n1.2\n\nno shield\n13mm shield\n13mm double shield\n\n1\n\n20mm shield\n20mm double shield\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\nField (mT)\n\nFigure 6.

A change in the\nfocusing of the photo electrons onto the first dynode improved the homogeneity of the gain and of\nthe light collection. The gain and width of the\nsignal as well the signal loss have been measured\nfor voltages between \u2212700 and \u22121000 V. We have\ndemonstrated that running the MaPMT at lower\ngains significantly increases the signal loss below\nthreshold. Finally, we have evaluated the sensitivity of the MaPMT to longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields up to 35 mT.\n7.
