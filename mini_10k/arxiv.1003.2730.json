In this paper, we show that this\nannihilation rate can receive large additional contributions from three-body final states consisting of\na real and a virtual massive particle, such as W W \u2217 (\u2192 W f f \u0304\u2032 ) and tt\u0304\u2217 (\u2192 tW b\u0304). We consider two\nspecific examples, from the singlet model and the MSSM, and find that, due to the new three-body\nfinal state contributions, the prediction for the relic density may decrease by more than a factor two,\nwhereas the present dark matter annihilation rate gets enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude.\nSome of the implications of these results are briefly discussed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDark matter annihilations have two different and\nequally important roles in the phenomenology of dark\nmatter models. On the one hand, the annihilation of\ndark matter particles in the early Universe dictates, via\nthe Boltzmann equation, the expected relic density and,\nconsequently, the viable parameter space of dark matter\nmodels. This parameter space is usually obtained by requiring, on top of accelerator and precision bounds, that\nthe relic density be consistent with the observed dark\nmatter density [1]. Hence, an accurate computation of\nthe dark matter annihilation cross section is almost a prerequisite for dark matter studies. In addition, the present\nannihilation rate of dark matter particles determines the\nindirect detection signatures of dark matter. Thus, to\nfind the expected fluxes in gamma rays, neutrinos, and\nantimatter generated by dark matter annihilations, we\nmust first compute properly the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter particles.\nUp to now, most studies have only consider dark matter annihilations into either two-body final states, or\nthree-body final states with a massless gauge boson [2],\nsuch as q q\u0304g or f f \u0304\u03b3, and have implicitly assumed that\nthey dominate the total annihilation cross section. There\nexists, however, another class of three-body final states\nthat may have an important impact on dark matter annihilations. They are final states consisting of a real and\na virtual massive particle, such as W W \u2217 (W f f \u0304\u2032 ) and tt\u0304\u2217\n(tW b\u0304), and are the main subject of this paper. These\nthree-body final states have not been considered in much\ndetail in the literature. In fact, neither DarkSUSY [3]\nnor micrOMEGAs [4], two sophisticated programs commonly used to study the phenomenology of dark matter models, include any of these three-body final states\nin their calculations. To our knowledge, the only works\nwhere such final states have been considered are [5] and\n[6]. In [5], Chen and Kamionkowski computed the cross\nsection for neutralino annihilation into the three-body\nfinal states W W \u2217 and tt\u0304\u2217 and showed that, in certain\nregions of the parameter space, they can enhance the\n\nneutrino signal expected from neutralino annihilations.\nIn that work, which has remained largely unnoticed over\nall these years, they did not study the possible effect\nof three-body final states on the neutralino relic abundance; they simply stated that such effect should be negligible. In [6], Hosotani, Ko, and Tanaka considered stable higgs bosons as cold dark matter candidates in the\ncontext of gauge-higgs unification models. They found,\nusing a semi-analytic approximation, that the inclusion\nof the three-body final state W W \u2217 modifies significantly\nthe prediction of the relic density for dark matter masses\nbelow the W threshold. In this paper, we will update and\nimprove these previous results in several ways. We will\naccurately compute the effect of three-body final states\non the annihilation rate of dark matter particles and on\ntheir relic abundance in two well-motivated extensions of\nthe standard model: the MSSM and the singlet scalar\nmodel. In both cases, we find that the inclusion of threebody final states considerably affects the predicted relic\ndensity and the indirect detection signal of dark matter particles. We thus demonstrate that three-body final\nstates consisting of a real and a virtual massive particle\ncannot be generally neglected in dark matter annihilations.\n\nTHREE-BODY FINAL STATES\n\nOrdinarily, particle physics processes such as decays\nand annihilations are dominated \u2013provided that they are\nopen\u2013 by two-body final states. Three-body final states\nare typically suppressed with respect to them by one additional coupling and one more propagator. Exceptions\nto this behaviour are not uncommon though. The decay\nof the higgs boson in the standard model constitute a\nparticularly striking example of the importance of threebody final states. An intermediate mass higgs boson, 135\nGeV . mh . 160 GeV, decays mainly into a three body\nfinal state consisting of a real W boson and a virtual\none (W \u2217 ) that in turn decays into a fermion-antifermion\npair, h \u2192 W W \u2217 \u2192 W f f \u0304\u2032 [7]. This three-body final\nstate accounts for more than 10% of the branching for\n\n\f2\n100\n\n\u03c3v(3-body)/\u03c3v(2-body)\n\nhiggs masses above 116 GeV and dominates over bb\u0304 in a\nwide region below the W + W \u2212 threshold. Thus, to properly compute the higgs decay width and its branching\nratios, two-body decays are not enough; three-body final\nstates must necessarily be taken into account. By the\nsame token, we will see that, in some cases, to accurately\ncompute the dark matter relic density and its indirect\ndetection signals it is mandatory to include three-body\nfinal states.\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\nBesides illustrating the need to go beyond two-body\nfinal states, the analogy with the decays of the higgs boson also allows us to foresee the conditions under which\nthree-body final states are expected to be relevant in dark\nmatter annihilations. Notice that, in the higgs case, the\ndecay h \u2192 W + W \u2212 becomes dominant once it is open,\nand it is below that threshold that the three-body decay (into W W \u2217 ) is important. For dark matter annihilations, accordingly, three-body final states could be\nrelevant below the threshold of a standard model particle, X, if the annihilation into X X\u0304 becomes dominant\nfor mDM > mX , where mDM denotes the mass of the\ndark matter particle. Given that, in most dark matter\nmodels, mDM \u223c 100 GeV (WIMPs), X could be a W\n(or Z) boson, a higgs boson, or a top-quark. Hence,\nthree-body final states might be relevant for dark matter masses below MW , mh , or mt . To satisfy the other\ncondition observed in the higgs case, we need that the annihilation into W + W \u2212 , hh or tt\u0304 become dominant above\nthe respective threshold. Thus, whether three-body final states turn out to be relevant or not will depend on\nthe specific particle physics model considered and on the\nregion of the parameter space examined.\nWe will use two examples, singlet scalar dark matter\nand neutralino dark matter in the MSSM, to illustrate\nthe relevance of three-body final states in dark matter\nannihilations. In both cases we find regions in the parameter space where the inclusion of three-body final\nstates modifies in a significant way the dark matter phenomenology of these models.\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFIG. 2: The ratio between the three-body and the two-body\nannihilation rate in the singlet scalar model of dark matter.\n\nSINGLET SCALAR DARK MATTER\n\nThe singlet scalar model [8, 9] is one of the simplest\nextensions of the standard model that may explain the\ndark mattter. It includes one additional scalar field, S,\nthat is neutral under the standard model gauge group\nand odd under a new discrete symmetry Z2 (S \u2192 \u2212S).\nThis symmetry enforces the stability of S and renders it\na suitable dark matter candidate. This simple model introduces only two additional parameters to the standard\nmodel: the singlet mass, mS , and the coupling between\nthe singlets and the higgs, \u03bb. In addition, the higgs mass\n(mh ), a standard model parameter, also enters into dark\nmatter calculations. It has been shown elsewhere, see e.g.\n[9], that the singlet scalar model can indeed explain the\nobserved dark matter density and that it can be tested\nthrough direct and indirect detection in future experiments.\nIn this model, singlets annihilate mainly through\ns-channel higgs boson exchange into standard model\nfermions and gauge bosons. Among the two-body final states, the main annihilation channels are bb\u0304 for\nmS < MW and W + W \u2212 for mS > MW . It is a situation analogous to that of higgs boson decays mentioned\npreviously. Henceforth, it is likely that within the mass\nrange\n50 GeV . mS .

To compute the cross\nsections we used the CalcHEP [10] and micrOMEGAs\n[4] packages. Even though \u03c3v(3-body) and \u03c3v(2-body)\nare both resonant for mS \u223c 60 GeV, their ratio has a\nsmooth non-resonant behavior, as observed in the figure.\nMoreover, because \u03bb and mh affect both cross sections\nin the same way, the line shown in figure 2 is actually\nindependent of these parameters. In other words, it is a\ngeneric prediction of the singlet model.\nNotice from the figure that already for mS \u223c 60 GeV\nthe three-body final state is not negligible, accounting\nfor about 10% of the cross section. For mS \u223c 70 GeV,\nthe two-body and the three-body cross sections are of\nthe same order. Finally, between mS \u223c 70 GeV and\nmS \u223c MW , the singlet annihilation cross section is\nclearly dominated by the three-body final state. In fact,\nclose to MW the cross section into W W \u2217 is more than 10\ntimes larger than the total cross section into two-body final states. Hence, for singlet masses between 60 GeV and\nMW , the three-body final state cannot be neglected in indirect detection studies, for it modifies considerably the\ntotal annihilation rate and the branching fractions into\nstandard model particles, giving rise to different yields in\nphotons, neutrinos, and antimatter.\nDue to the higher dark matter velocity in the early\nUniverse and to the thermal averaging of the cross section, the effect of the three-body final state on the singlet relic density is expected to be smaller. It is significant nonetheless, as illustrated by figures 3-5. Figure 3\ncompares the correct relic density (solid line), obtained\nincluding two- and three-body final states, with the predicted relic density for two-body final states only (dashdotted line), as usually computed in the literature.

The parameter \u03bb was set to 0.03.\n\nthat figure we set mh = 120 GeV and \u03bb = 0.03. To obtain these results we again used CalcHEP, to compute\nthe three-body contribution, and micrOMEGAs, to calculate the two-body part and to solve the Boltzmann\nequation. Both lines have the same generic behavior.\nThe relic density initially increases as the singlet mass\ndeparts from the higgs resonance (located at mS \u223c 60\nGeV), it reaches a maximum, and it then decreases in\nthe vicinity of the W -threshold. The value of the correct\nrelic density, however, may differ significantly from that\npredicted for annihilation into two-body final states. At\nmS \u223c 75 GeV, for instance, the two-body approximation\noverestimates the cross section by more than a factor 2.\nA similar effect is present also for larger higgs masses,\nas illustrated in figure 4. In this case the relic density\nis a decreasing function of the singlet mass. Again, we\nobserve that the two-body approximation overestimates\nthe relic density for singlet masses between 50 GeV and\nMW . A better way to visualize the effect of the threebody final state on the relic density is by displaying the\nratio of the correct relic density (two and three-body) to\nthe two-body relic density, as done in figure 5. Notice\nthat the ratio is significantly smaller than 1 over a wide\nmass range and that it can decrease even below 0.4, a\nlarge deviation from the two-body result. From this figure we learn that in the singlet model the correct relic\ndensity could be significantly smaller than the relic density obtained for two-body final states.\nA detailed analysis of the resulting new parameter\nspace of the singlet model, and of the implications of\nthree-body final states for its direct and indirect detection prospects will be done in a future work.

The resulting lightest neutralino is always bino-like.\nFigure 7 shows, as a function of the neutralino mass,\nthe ratio between the cross section into the three-body\nfinal state tt\u0304\u2217 and that one into two-body final states.\nSince the latter is almost constant over the neutralino\nmass range shown, the variation observed in the figure\nis entirely due to the cross section into the three-body\nfinal state. As before, we took v \u2248 10\u22123 and used micrOMEGAs and CalcHEP to compute the cross sections.\nNotice from the figure that at m\u03c7 \u223c 140 GeV the threebody final state already reaches 10% of the total annihilation cross section. For m\u03c7 \u223c 150 GeV, the three-body\nfinal state contribute to the cross section as much as the\ntwo-body states. For larger masses, up to the top threshold, the neutralino annihilation cross section is entirely\ndominated by the three-body final state. In that region,\nthe two-body final state approximation commonly used\nin previous works would fail badly, underestimating the\nneutralino annihilation cross section and misjudging the\nresulting final states. As a consequence, neither the normalization nor the spectrum of the \u03b3, \u03bd, e+ and p\u0304 generated in neutralino annihilations would be correct.\nThe effect of the three-body final state on the neutralino relic density is illustrated in figures 8 and 9. In the\ncalculation, coannihilation effects between the neutralino\nand the lightest stop are automatically taken into account. They are not important though, because the mass\ndifference between them is significant. Notice that the\ncorrect neutralino abundance, calculated including the\n\nFor neutralino dark matter the most promising region\nwhere three-body final states may play an important role\nis below the top-quark threshold. That is, for neutralino\nmasses in the range\n130 GeV . m\u03c7 . mt .\n\n(2)\n\nIn this mass interval, neutralinos can annihilate into a\ntt\u0304\u2217 pair followed by the decay of the virtual t\u0304 into W \u2212 b\u0304\n(\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 tt\u0304\u2217 \u2192 tW b\u0304). One of the diagrams that contribute\nto this process in the MSSM is illustrated in figure 6.\nFor bino-like neutralinos, the dominant two-body annihilation channel in such mass interval is typically bb\u0304. Can\nthe three-body final state dominate over bb\u0304?\nTo ensure that diagrams with three-body final states,\nsuch as figure 6, are not suppressed, we will focus on a\nregion of the parameter space featuring a relatively light\nstop. Table I shows the supersymmetric parameters, defined at low energy, that we consider in the following.\nThey give rise to models compatible with present bounds\nfrom accelerator and precision data. The lightest stop,\nwhich is lighter than all other squarks thanks to the nonzero trilinear coupling At , has a mass of about 260 GeV.\n\n\u03c7\n\nt\u0304\n\nW\n\nt\u0303\n\n\u03c7\n\nt\nb\n\nFIG. 6: One of the diagrams with three-body final states that\nenhances the neutralino annihilation rate in the MSSM.\n\nParameter M2 , M3 , ml\u0303 ,\u03bc\nmq\u0303\nAt\nMA tan \u03b2\nValue\n1 TeV\n500 GeV 1.4 TeV 1.5 TeV 5\nTABLE I: Supersymmetric parameters used.

To reach\nthat accuracy, the three-body final states studied in this\nwork must necessarily be included in the calculation.\nIn any case, notice that, in contrast with the singlet\nmodel studied in the previous section, the large effect due\nto three-body final states below the top threshold is not\na generic feature of the MSSM. It is only within certain\nconfigurations, for specific sets of parameters, that the\neffect becomes important. It must be also said that there\ncertainly exist additional corrections not included in our\nanalysis, such as one-loop corrections to the cross sections\nand toponium resonance effects below the top threshold,\nthat could also modify the neutralino annihilation cross\nsection and the predicted neutralino relic density in the\nMSSM.\nThe most significant feature brought about by dark\nmatter annihilation into the three-body final state tt\u0304\u2217 in\nsupersymmetric models is that, as we have seen, it may\ngive rise to large corrections to the neutralino annihilation cross section and to the relic density of neutralino\ndark matter.\n\nmatter and for its indirect detection signatures. In a future work we will study in more detail the implications\nof these results.\nIt is a pleasure to thank Laura for useful discussions and for bringing reference [6] to my attention.

Two\nwell-motivated scenarios were used to illustrate this effect: the singlet scalar and the MSSM. In both cases, we\ndemonstrated that these new contributions can significantly modify the prediction for the relic density of dark\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: carlos.yaguna@uam.es\n[1] J.
