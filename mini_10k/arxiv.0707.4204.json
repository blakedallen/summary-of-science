Thus, the double bracket kinetic framework serves\nas a unifying method for deriving different types of dynamics, from density\u2013orientation to\nSmoluchowski equations. Extensions for more general physical systems are also discussed.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\nGeometric models of dissipation in physical systems\n\nThis paper explains how the geometry of double-bracket dissipation makes its way from the\nmicroscopic (kinetic theory) level to the macroscopic (continuum) level in the process of taking\nmoments of the Vlasov probability distribution function, when the particles in the microscopic\ndescription carry an internal variable that is orientation dependent. Without orientation dependence, the moment equations derived here yield a nonlocal variant of the famous Darcy law\n[Darcy1856]. When orientation is included, the resulting Lie-Darcy moment equations identify\nthe macroscopic parameters of the continuum description and govern their evolution.\nIn previous work, Gibbons, Holm and Kupershmidt [GiHoKu1982, GiHoKu1983] (abbreviated GHK) showed that the process of taking moments of Vlasov's equation for such particles\nis a Poisson map. GHK used this property to derive the equations of chromohydrodynamics.\nThese are the equations of a fluid plasma consisting of particles carrying Yang-Mills charges\nand interacting self-consistently via a Yang-Mills field. The GHK Poisson map for chromohydrodynamics was an extension of the Kupershmidt-Manin (KM) bracket [KuMa1978] for the\nmoments in the integrable hierarchy of long-wave equations due to Benney [Be1973]. Gibbons\n[Gi1981] had noticed that the KM Poisson map for the Benney equations would also apply to\n1\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 2\n\nthe moments of a Vlasov (collisionless) plasma [Vlasov1961] for particles carrying an ordinary\nelectric charge. GHK extended the KM bracket to allow the particles to carry orientation (or\nYang-Mills) properties. GHK considered only Hamiltonian motion. They did not consider the\ncorresponding double-bracket Poisson structure of dissipation. That is the subject of the present\nwork.\n1.1.1\n\nHistory of double-bracket dissipation\n\nBloch, Krishnaprasad, Marsden and Ratiu ([BlKrMaRa1996] abbreviated BKMR) observed that\nlinear dissipative terms of the standard Rayleigh dissipation type are inappropriate for dynamical systems undergoing coadjoint motion. Such systems are expressed on the duals of Lie\nalgebras and they commonly arise from variational principles defined on tangent spaces of Lie\ngroups. A well known example of coadjoint motion is provided by Euler's equations for an ideal\nincompressible fluid [Ar1966]. Not unexpectedly, adding linear viscous dissipation to create the\nNavier-Stokes equations breaks the coadjoint nature of the ideal flow. Of course, ordinary viscosity does not suffice to describe dissipation in the presence of orientation-dependent particle\ninteractions.\nRestriction to coadjoint orbits requires nonlinear dissipation, whose gradient structure differs\nfrom the Rayleigh dissipation approach leading to Navier-Stokes viscosity. As a familiar example\non which to build their paradigm, BKMR emphasized a form of energy dissipation (Gilbert\ndissipation [Gilbert1955]) arising in models of ferromagnetic spin systems that preserves the\nmagnitude of angular momentum. In the context of Euler-Poincar\u00e9 or Lie-Poisson systems, this\nmeans that coadjoint orbits remain invariant, but the energy decreases along the orbits. BKMR\ndiscovered that their geometric construction of the nonlinear dissipative terms summoned the\ndouble bracket equation of Brockett [Br1988, Br1993]. In fact, the double bracket form is well\nadapted to the study of dissipative motion on Lie groups since it was originally constructed as\na gradient system [Bloch1990, BlBrRa1992, Br1994, BlFlRa1996].\nWhile a single Poisson bracket operation is bilinear and antisymmetric, a double bracket\noperation is a symmetric operation. Symmetric brackets for dissipative systems, particularly for\nfluids and plasmas, were considered previously by Kaufman [Ka1984, Ka1985], Grmela [Gr1984,\nGr1993a, Gr1993b], Morrison [Mo1984, Mo1986], and Turski and Kaufman [TuKa1987]. The\ndissipative brackets introduced in BKMR were particularly motivated by the double bracket\noperations introduced in Vallis, Carnevale, and Young [VaCaYo1989] for incompressible fluid\nflows.\n1.1.2\n\nSelective decay hypothesis\n\nOne of the motivations for Vallis et al. [VaCaYo1989] was the selective decay hypothesis,\nwhich arose in turbulence research [MaMo1980] and is consistent with the preservation of coadjoint orbits. According to the selective decay hypothesis, energy in strongly nonequilibrium\nstatistical systems tends to decay much faster than certain other ideally conserved properties.\nIn particular, energy decays much faster in such systems than those \"kinematic\" or \"geometric\"\nproperties that would have been preserved in the ideal nondissipative limit independently of the\nchoice of the Hamiltonian. Examples are the Casimir functions for the Lie-Poisson formulations\nof various ideal fluid models [HoMaRaWe1985].\nThe selective decay hypothesis was inspired by a famous example; namely, that enstrophy\ndecays much more slowly than kinetic energy in 2D incompressible fluid turbulence. Kraichnan\n[Kr1967] showed that the decay of kinetic energy under the preservation of enstrophy causes\ndramatic effects in 2D turbulence. Namely, it causes the well known \"inverse cascade\" of kinetic\nenergy to larger scales, rather than the usual \"forward cascade\" of energy to smaller scales\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 3\n\nthat is observed in 3D turbulence. In 2D ideal incompressible fluid flow the enstrophy (the\nL2 norm of the vorticity) is preserved on coadjoint orbits. That is, enstrophy is a Casimir of\nthe Lie-Poisson bracket in the Hamiltonian formulation of the 2D Euler fluid equations. Vallis\net al. [VaCaYo1989] chose a form of dissipation that was expressible as a double Lie-Poisson\nbracket. This choice of dissipation preserved the enstrophy and thereby enforced the selective\ndecay hypothesis for all 2D incompressible fluid solutions, laminar as well as turbulent.\nOnce its dramatic effects were recognized in 2D turbulence, selective decay was posited as a\ngoverning mechanism in other systems, particularly in statistical behavior of fluid systems with\nhigh variability. For example, the slow decay of magnetic helicity was popularly invoked as a\npossible means of obtaining magnetically confined plasmas [Ta1986]. Likewise, in geophysical\nfluid flows, the slow decay of potential vorticity (PV) relative to kinetic energy strongly influences\nthe dynamics of weather and climate patterns much as in the inverse cascade tendency in 2D\nturbulence. The use of selective decay ideas for PV thinking in meteorology and atmospheric\nscience has become standard practice since the fundamental work in [HoMcRo1985, Yo1987].\n1.1.3\n\nKandrup and the double bracket for astrophysical instabilities\n\nA form of selective decay based on double-bracket dissipation was proposed in astrophysics by\nKandrup [Ka1991] for the purpose of modeling gravitational radiation of energy in stars. In\nthis case, the double-bracket dissipation produced rapidly growing instabilities that again had\ndramatic effects on the solution. The form of double-bracket dissipation proposed in Kandrup\n[Ka1991] is a strong motivation for the present work and it also played a central role in the\nstudy of instabilities in BKMR.\nThe double bracket idea mentioned earlier in the context of magnetization dynamics [Gilbert1955]\nimplements dissipation by the sequential application of two Poisson bracket operations. The dissipative Vlasov equation in [Ka1991] is written as:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a \u001a\n\u001b\u001b\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4H\n\u2202f\n+ f,\n= \u03b1 f, f,\n,\n(1.1)\n\u2202t\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\nwhere f (q, p, t) is the probability distribution function for a single particle in phase-space, \u03b1 > 0\nis a positive constant, H is the Vlasov Hamiltonian (depending on the system under consideration) and {* , *} is the canonical Poisson bracket in (q, p). Here we use standard notation in\nkinetic theory: in the general case, q is a point on a Riemannian manifold Q, while (q, p) \u2208 T \u2217 Q\nis a point in the cotangent bundle. In common situations one considers Q = Rk , so that\nT \u2217 Q = R2k . In this paper we shall consider a one dimensional physical space (Q = R) to\nsimplify the treatment.\nWhen \u03b1 \u2192 0 in (1.1), this equation reduces the Vlasov equation for collisionless plasmas.\nFor \u03b1 > 0, this is the double bracket dissipation approach for the Vlasov-Poisson equation.\nThis nonlinear double bracket approach for introducing dissipation into the Vlasov equation\ndiffers from the standard Fokker-Planck linear diffusive approach [Fokker-Plank1931], which\nadds dissipation on the right hand side of equation (1.1) as a linear term given by the Laplace\noperator in the momentum coordinate \u2206p f .\n1.1.4\n\nThe double bracket and Riemannian geometry\n\nAn interesting feature of the double bracket formulation is that it leads via a variational approach\nto a symmetric Leibnitz bracket that in turn yields a metric tensor and an associated Riemannian\n(rather than symplectic) geometry for the solutions. The variational approach thus preserves\nthe nature of the evolution of Vlasov phase space density, by coadjoint motion under the action\nof the canonical transformations on phase space densities.\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 4\n\nAs Otto [Ot2001] explained, the Riemannian geometry of dissipation may be revealed by understanding how it emerges from a variational principle. Here, we follow the variational approach\nand consider a generalization of the double bracket structure in equation (1.1) that recovers previous cases for particular choices of modeling quantities introduced in [HoPuTr2007-CR],\n\u001a\n\u001b \u001a \u001a\n\u001b\u001b\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4E\n\u2202f\n+ f,\n= f, \u03bc[f ] ,\n.\n(1.2)\n\u2202t\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\nThe important feature of this double-bracket approach to dissipation (which is necessarily\nnonlinear) for the Vlasov equation is that this form of the dissipation preserves the most basic property of Vlasov dynamics. Namely, the dissipation is introduced as a canonical\ntransformation. This means that the solution is still an invariant probability distribution and satisfies Liouville's theorem, even though its dynamics do not conserve either\nthe Hamiltonian H or the energy E. Eq. (1.2) generalizes the double bracket operation in\nEq. (1.1) and reduces to it when the Hamiltonian H is identical to the dissipated energy E\nand the mobility \u03bc[f ] = \u03b1f is proportional to the Vlasov distribution function f for a positive\nconstant \u03b1 > 0. As shown in [HoPuTr2007-CR] the generalization (1.2) has important effects\non the types of solutions that are available to this equation. Indeed, the form (1.2) of the\nVlasov equation with dissipation allows for more general mobilities than those considered in\n[BlKrMaRa1996, Ka1991, Ka1984, Mo1984]. For example, one may choose mobility in the form\n\u03bc[f ] = K \u2217f , where the ( \u2217 ) operation is a convolution in phase space with an appropriate kernel\nK. In [HoPuTr2007] the smoothing operation in the definition of \u03bc[f ] introduces a fundamental\naction scale (the area in phase space associated with the kernel K) into the dissipation mechanism. Accordingly, the dissipation depends on phase-space averaged quantities, rather than\nlocal pointwise values.\nThis smoothing also has the fundamental advantage of endowing (1.2) with the one-particle\nsolution as its singular solution. The generalization Eq. (1.2) may also be justified by using\nthermodynamic and geometric arguments [HoPuTr2007]. Section 2 shows that this generalization leads from the microscopic kinetic level to the classic Darcy law (velocity being proportional\nto force) in the continuum description.\n\n1.2\n\nOur goal and approach\n\nThe goal of the present work is to determine the macroscopic implications of introducing nonlinear double-bracket dissipation at the microscopic level, so as to respect the coadjoint orbits\nof canonical transformations for dynamics that depends upon particle orientation. Our approach introduces this orientation dependence into the microscopic description by augmenting\nthe canonical Poisson bracket in position q and momentum p so as to include the Lie-Poisson\npart for orientation g taking values in the dual g\u2217 of the Lie algebra g, with eventually g = so(3)\nfor physical orientation. Here we denote by G the Lie group underlying the particle symmetry\nproperties, while the corresponding Lie algebra g = Te G and its dual g\u2217 = Te\u2217 G are denoted by\ngothic fonts. Although it is unusual to denote a point in g\u2217 by g, we shall keep this notation to\navoid confusion with the Greek indexes used below.\nThe identification of the particle orientation g with an element in so\u2217 (3) is consistent with\nordinary theories in condensed matter physics, such as the theory of sin glasses. In this context,\nthe spin angular momentum variable s \u2208 so\u2217 (3) possesses the typical Poisson bracket {s\u03bc , s\u03bd } =\n\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb s\u03bb [DzVo1980], where the Levi-Civita symbol \u03b5 denotes the total antisymmetric tensor.\nIn more general situations when the rotational symmetry is completely broken, one also needs\nto consider the particle rotational state \u0398 \u2208 SO(3) as an extra Lie group coordinate in the\naugmented phase-space. This is relevant, for example, when one wants to consider frustration\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 5\n\neffects. However, here we shall not deal with symmetry breaking and we shall simply assume that\nthe orientational degree of freedom can be identified with the momentum variable g \u2208 so\u2217 (3),\nor in more generality g \u2208 g\u2217 .\nFrom the considerations above, one concludes that the introduction of the orientational\ndegree of freedom g leads to a Vlasov distribution f (q, p, g, t) on the augmented phase space\nT \u2217 Q \u00d7 g\u2217 , whose total Poisson bracket is written in the GHK form as\nn\no\nn\no \u001c \u0014 \u2202f \u2202h \u0015\u001d\nf, h := f, h + g,\n,\n,\n(1.3)\n\u2202g \u2202g\n1\n\nwhere [ * , * ] : g \u00d7 g \u2192 g is the Lie algebra bracket and h * , * i : g\u2217 \u00d7 g \u2192 R is the pairing between\nthe Lie algebra g and its dual g\u2217 . For rotations, g = so(3) and the bracket [ * , * ] becomes the\ncross product of vectors in R3 . Correspondingly, the pairing h * , * i becomes the dot product of\nvectors in R3 . We consider the double-bracket dynamics of f (q, p, g, t) resulting from replacing\nthe canonical Poisson brackets in Eq. (1.2) by the direct sum of canonical and Lie-Poisson\nbrackets { * , * }1 in Eq. (1.3). We then take moments of the resulting dynamics of f (q, p, g, t)\nwith respect to momentum p and orientation g, to obtain the dynamics of the macroscopic\ndescription. The moments with respect to momentum p alone provide an intermediate set of\ndynamical equations for the p\u2212moments,\nZ\nAn (q, g, t) := pn f (q, p, g, t) dp\nwith g \u2208 g\u2217 .\n(1.4)\n(In higher dimensions one replaces the power pn with the tensor power p\u2297 n , also denoted by\n\u2297n p.) These intermediate dynamics are reminiscent of the Smoluchowski equation for the probability A0 (q, g, t). We shall show how the derivation of usual Smoluchowski-type equations from\ndouble-bracket arguments may require special care depending on the chosen moment closure.\nIn particular, we formulate a new Smoluchowski equation, which encodes the Landau-LifshitzGilbert dissipation for ferromagnetic particles.\nWe also find a closed set of continuum equations for the (p, g) moments of the type\nZ\nAn,\u03bd (q, t) := pn g\u03bd f (q, p, g, t) dp dg .\n(1.5)\nwhere g\u03bd denotes the tensor power g\u03bd = g \u2297 * * * \u2297 g, \u03bd times. The final closure provides the\nmacroscopic continuum dynamics for the set of moments of the double-bracket kinetic equations\n(1.2) under the replacement { * , * } \u2192 { * , * }1 . This macroscopic continuum closure inherits the\ngeometric properties of the double bracket, because the process of taking these moments is a\nPoisson map, as observed in GHK [GiHoKu1982, GiHoKu1983, GiHoTr2008].\n\n1.3\n\nMathematical framework for geometric dissipation\n\nAs explained in [Ot2001] dissipation of energy E may naturally summon an appropriate metric\ntensor. In previous work Holm and Putkaradze [HoPu2007, HoPuTr2007] introduced a distance\nbetween functions on a vector space V that is acted on by a Lie algebra X of vector fields.\nIn particular they showed that that for any two functionals F [\u03ba], G[\u03ba] of a geometric tensor\nquantity \u03ba \u2208 V a distance between them may be defined via the Riemannian metric,\n\u001d\n\u001c\u0010\n\u03b4E \u0011\u266f\n\u03b4F \u0011 \u0010\n, \u03ba\u22c4\n.\n(1.6)\n\u03bc[\u03ba] \u22c4\ng\u03ba (F , E) =\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\nX\u2217 \u00d7X\nHere h * , * i denotes the L2 pairing of vector fields in X with their dual one-form densities in\nX\u2217 , sharp ( * )\u266f raises the vector index from covariant to contravariant and \u03bc[\u03ba] is the mobility\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 6\n\nfunctional. The mobility \u03bc[\u03ba] is assumed to satisfy the requirements for (1.6) to be positive\ndefinite and symmetric, as discussed in [HoPuTr2007]. The diamond operation (\u22c4) in equation\n(1.6) is the dual of the Lie algebra action, defined as follows. Let a vector field \u03be \u2208 X act on a\nvector space V by Lie derivation, so that the Lie algebra action of \u03be on any element \u03ba \u2208 V is\ngiven by the Lie derivative, \u03be * \u03ba = \u00a3\u03be \u03ba. The operation dual to the Lie derivative is denoted by\n\u22c4 and defined in terms of the L2 pairings between X and X\u2217 and between V and V \u2217 as\nE\nD\nD\nE\n\u03b6 \u22c4 \u03ba, \u03be \u2217 := \u03b6, \u2212\u00a3\u03be \u03ba \u2217 .\n(1.7)\nX \u00d7X\n\nV \u00d7V\n\nGiven the metric (1.6) and a dissipated energy functional E[\u03ba], the time evolution of arbitrary\nfunctional F [\u03ba] is given by [HoPu2007, HoPuTr2007] as\n\u1e1e = {{ F , E }}[\u03ba] := \u2212 g\u03ba (F, E) ,\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhich specifies the dynamics of any functional F [\u03ba], given the the energy dependence E[\u03ba]. The\nbracket {{ F , E }} is shown to satisfy the Leibnitz product-rule property for a suitable class\nof mobility functionals \u03bc[\u03ba] in [HoPu2007, HoPuTr2007]. Eq. (1.8) and positivity of g\u03ba (E, E)\nimply that the energy E decays in time until it eventually reaches a critical point, \u03b4E/\u03b4\u03ba = 0.\nFor densities (dual to functions in the L2 pairing), the Lie derivative is the divergence: \u00a3\u03be \u03ba =\ndiv(\u03ba \u03be) and its dual operation is (minus) the gradient: \u03ba \u22c4 \u03b6 = \u2212\u03ba \u2207\u03b6. Thus, for densities the\nsymbol diamond ( \u22c4 ) is replaced by gradient ( \u2207 ) in the metric defined in (1.8).\nThe definition of the dissipative bracket in Eq. (1.8) for arbitrary functionals {{ F , E }}[\u03ba] is\nthe basis for our present considerations of dissipation in kinetic equations. In this paper we will\nextend the geometric dissipation (1.8) to the symplectic case by defining the star ( \u22c6 ) operator,\nwhich is the analogue of diamond ( \u22c4 ) for symplectic spaces.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDissipation in the Vlasov equation and the moment hierarchy\nDissipative bracket for the Vlasov equation\n\nThe dissipative term in equation (1.2) is found by considering the symplectic algebra action of\na Hamiltonian vector field Xh associated with a Hamiltonian function h. This action is given\non a phase space density f through the canonical Poisson bracket {* , *} as follows [MaWe82]:\n\u00a3Xh f = {f, h} =: h * f . One can check that the dual diamond operator in (1.7) (denoted by\n\u22c6 for the symplectic Lie algebra action above) is still a Poisson bracket [HoPuTr2007], so that\ng \u22c6 f = {g, f }. Thus, we introduce the dissipative bracket (1.8)\n+\n*\u001a\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b+ *( \u001a\n\u001b)\n\u03b4F\n\u03b4E \u266f\n\u03b4F\n\u03b4E \u266f\n(2.1)\n, f,\n=\nf, \u03bc[f ] ,\n,\n{{ E , F }} = \u2212\n\u03bc[f ] ,\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\nwhich gives the dissipative term in equation (1.2). Here, the sharp \u266f operator is a suitably chosen\nmapping from the (dual) space of distributions to the Lie algebra of phase space functions, so\nthe pairing can be taken. Usually, we take the pairing to be a simple L2 pairing, in which case\nthe sharp notation is unnecessary, as in the previously postulated form of the equations (1.2).\nThe sharp notation in (2.1) is used to indicate that the pairing may involve a metric.\nAssumption 2.1 Everywhere in this paper, we assume that the Lie algebra g of orientation\nmotions is finite dimensional. Of particular interest to application is the motion of magnetized\nparticles, described by SO(3) group. For these motions, g = so(3) \u2243 R3 , so the integrals with\nrespect to g \u2208 g are simply three-dimensional integrals.\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 7\n\nExtensions of our theory could be computed for an arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras,\ndescribing, for example, particles with a finite number of joints. However, in this paper we will\nstay away from infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, that may arise, for example, for the case of\nflexible filaments. Even though the formal extension of our double bracket dissipation theory is\npossible even in that case, the mathematical difficulties of defining integrals and corresponding\nmeasures are beyond the scope of this paper. On the other hand, the canonical variables momenta p and coordinates q describe the motion of the center of mass of the particles and thus\nthe integrals with respect to p and q are always finite-dimensional. In order to elaborate further,\nwe introduce the following\nAssumption 2.2 Everywhere in the paper we assume that all the finite-dimensional integrals\ndefining the moments (1.5) exist. Formally, this can be achieved, for example, by requiring that\nthe distribution function f is smooth and decays to zero sufficiently fast whenever p, q or g tend\nto \u221e in some properly defined norm. While for compact configuration manifolds requirements\non q integration convergence are automatically satisfied, the convergence requirements still need\nto be enforced for p and g.\nAn interesting point about this form of double-bracket dissipation in kinetic equations is\nthat it leads rather naturally to another widely used dissipative equation; namely, the venerable\nDarcy law [Darcy1856]. In particular, we will show in this section how one recovers the nonlocal\nversion of Darcy's law introduced in [HoPu2005, HoPu2006]. This could be accomplished by\nintegrating the purely dissipative kinetic equation\n\u001a \u001a\n\u001b\u001b\n\u03b4E\n\u2202f\n= f , \u03bc[f ] ,\n,\n(2.2)\n\u2202t\n\u03b4f\nwith respect to the momentum coordinate p (here we have dropped the sharp notation for\nsimplicity). We shall call this equation Double Bracket Vlasov equation (DBV). Note however,\nthat this DBV equation is valid for isotropic particles only. More general version of DBV\nequation including the anisotropy will be derived below in (3.1). In order to derive Darcy's law\nfor particle motion, we apply the geometric dissipative bracket (1.8) to the equations of the\nmoment hierarchy.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Kupershmidt-Manin bracket for 1D moment dynamics\n\nAs a general result [Gi1981], the equations for the moments of the Vlasov dynamics (Eq.\n(1.1) with \u03b1 \u2192 0) form a Lie-Poisson system under the\nR Kupershmidt-Manin (KM) bracket\n[KuMa1978]. The n-th moment is defined as An (q, t) := pn f (q, p, t) dp. These quantities have\na geometric interpretation in terms of (covariant) tensor densities [GiHoTr2005,\nGiHoTr2007,\nR\nGiHoTr2008] which can be seen by re-writing the moments as An = p \u2297n (p dq) f (q, p) dq \u2227 dp=\nAn (q) \u2297n+1 dq, where \u2297n dq := dq \u2297 * * * \u2297 dq n times. Thus, moments An belong to the vector\nspace dual to the contravariant tensors of the type \u03b2n = \u03b2n (q) \u2297n \u2202q . Upon denoting the spatial\nderivative \u2202/\u2202q by prime, these tensors are given the following Lie algebra structure [Ni1955]\n\u0001\n[[\u03b1m , \u03b2n ]] = n \u03b2n (q) \u03b1\u2032m (q) \u2212 m \u03b1m (q) \u03b2n\u2032 (q) \u2297n+m\u22121 \u2202q =: ad\u03b1m \u03b2n\n(2.3)\n\nso that the Kupershmidt-Manin Poisson bracket for moment dynamics is [KuMa1978, GiHoTr2008]\n\u0015\u0015\u001d\n\u001c\n\u0014\u0014\n\u03b4F \u03b4H\n,\n,\n(2.4)\n{F, H} = Am+n\u22121 ,\n\u03b4An \u03b4Am\nwhere we sum over repeated indices. Thus, for a given moment Hamiltonian H, the Vlasov\nmoment equations are \u2202t An = \u2212 ad\u2217\u03b4H/\u03b4Am Am+n\u22121 , where the ad\u2217 operator is defined by\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 8\n\nh ad\u2217\u03b2n Ak , \u03b1k\u2212n+1 i := h Ak , ad\u03b2n \u03b1k\u2212n+1 i and is given explicitly as ad\u2217\u03b2n Ak = ((k + 1) Ak \u2202 q \u03b2n +\nn \u03b2n \u2202 q Ak ) \u2297k\u2212n+2 dq.

Indeed, upon dropping the sharp for simplicity and by truncating equation (2.7)\nto consider only m = 1, we obtain the equation \u2202 t \u03c1 = \u00a3\u03b31 \u03c1 = \u2202 q (\u03c1 \u03b31 ), for the density \u03c1 := A0 .\nIf we assume that E = E[\u03c1] to neglect inertial effect and also that \u03bc\ne0 = \u03bc[\u03c1] for simplicity, then\n\u03b31 = (e\n\u03bc0 \u2202\u03b20 /\u2202q)\u266f is recognised as the Darcy velocity. Therefore, the density \u03c1 := A0 evolves\naccording to Darcy's law, namely\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u03b4E\n\u2202\u03c1\n=\n\u03c1 \u03bc[\u03c1]\n.\n(2.8)\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\u2202q \u03b4\u03c1\nNotice that no linear diffusion terms are present in the above equation, since such terms can\nonly arise from Brownian particle motion that is not considered in this paper. Linear diffusion\nterms can however be added a posteriori to account for stochastic effects.\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci\n\nDouble bracket dissipation in kinetic theory\n\nOctober 29, 2018 9\n\nRemark 2.4 (Local vs. nonlocal mobilities) We notice that in all our discussions it is not\nnecessary for the mobility quantity \u03bc to be a functional of the dynamical variable. Indeed, even in\nthe general formulation (1.6) of double-bracket dissipation, the quantity \u03bc[\u03ba] must only satisfy\nthe requirements for (1.6) to be symmetric and positive definite. Thus, at the kinetic level,\nthe phase-space mobility \u03bc[f ] in the dissipative Vlasov equation (2.2) can also be an ordinary\nfunction \u03bc(f ) (rather than a functional \u03bc[f ]) of the Vlasov distribution f (q, p) or even some\nfixed phase-space density \u03bc(q, p). At the macroscopic level of Darcy's law, this would correspond\nrespectively either to a function \u03bc(\u03c1) of the macroscopic particle density \u03c1(q) or to some fixed\nfunction \u03bc(q) on physical space. In these cases, the double bracket Vlasov equation (2.2) simply\nproduces Darcy's Law with complete absence of nonlocal terms. However, in what follows we\nshall consider the more general choice of a mobility functional, whose corresponding nonlocal\neffects have been investigated in [HoPu2005].\n\n2.4\n\nVlasov derivation of dissipative moment equations\n\nThis section is devoted to clarify how one can pass from the dissipative Vlasov equation (2.2)\nto the double-bracket equations for the moments (2.7). The starting point is to recognize that\nthe double-bracket structure of equation (2.2) involves a sharp operation ( * )\u266f as follows\n( \u001a\n\u001b )\n\u03b4E \u266f\n\u2202f\n,\n(2.9)\n= f , \u03bc[f ] ,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4f\nThis sharp operation is evidently defined through an appropriate (co-)metric, and thus the most\ngeneral form of the double-bracket Vlasov equation (2.2) is written as\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u001b\u001b\n\u03b4E\n\u2202f\n= f , K \u2217 \u03bc[f ] ,\n.\n(2.10)\n\u2202t\n\u03b4f\nHere K = K(q, p, q \u2032 , p\u2032 ) is a symmetric positive-definite kernel, so that the sharp operator is\ngiven by the convolution K \u2217 f = f \u266f taking a density variable f into a scalar function f \u266f. The\nsimplest choice of a \u03b4-function for K evidently returns equation (2.2). In a more general case,\none can consider a kernel K that is analytic in the momentum coordinates, so that the double\nbracket structure\n*\u001a\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b +\n\u001b\u0012\n\u001a\n\u001b\u0013\nZZ \u001a\n\u03b4F\n\u03b4E \u266f\n\u03b4E\n\u03b4F\n=\u2212\nf,\n, \u03bc[f ] ,\nK \u2217 \u03bc[f ] ,\ndq dp\n{{ E , F }} = \u2212\nf,\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n(2.11)\nbecomes\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001b \u001d\n\u001a\nZ\nX \u001cZ\n\u03b4F\n\u03b4E\nn\n\u2032m\n{{ E , F }} = \u2212\np f,\ndp , Kn,m \u2217 p\ndp\u2032\n\u03bc(f ),\n(2.12)\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\nn,m\nwhere we have used the Taylor expansion\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nK(q, p, q , p ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\npn p\u2032 m Kn,m (q, q \u2032 ) .\n\n(2.13)\n\nn,m=0\n\nAssumption 2.5 In what follows, we shall assume that the coefficients Kn,m decay sufficiently\nfast so that the convergence of all the necessary sums is guaranteed.\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci Double bracket dissipation in kinetic theory October 29, 2018 10\nP l\nUpon expanding \u03b4F/\u03b4f =\np \u03b4F/\u03b4Al (and analogously for \u03b4E/\u03b4f ) and integrating over the\nmomentum variables, one obtains the double-bracket structure for the moments in the form\nX\n\u0001\n{{ E , F }} = \u2212\ne k+n\u22121 , Kn,l \u2217 ad\u2217\u03b1m Am+l\u22121 ,\nad\u2217\u03b2k \u03bc\nn,l,k,m\n\nwhich evidently recovers (2.6).\nUpon setting k = m = 0 and n = l = 1, the above bracket returns Darcy's law for \u03c1 = A0 in\nthe more general form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u2202\u03c1(q, t)\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u03b4E\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n=\ndq\n\u03c1(q, t) K1,1 (q, q ) \u03bc\u03c1 (q , t)\n(2.14)\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\u2202q \u2032 \u03b4\u03c1\nwhich recovers (2.8) when K1,1 (q, q \u2032 ) = \u03b4(q \u2212 q \u2032 ). It is interesting to notice that, in the multidimensional treatment, the existence of the kernel K1,1 allows for a mobility matrix, rather than\njust a single-valued mobility functional.

Physically, this corresponds to the case of isotropic\nparticles moving through a non-isotropic medium.\nThe remainder of the paper concentrates on the case when the sharp operator ( * )\u266f is defined\nin terms of a delta-function kernel and the mobility \u03bc\u03c1 is a real-valued functional of \u03c1.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nDissipative dynamics with anisotropic interaction\nPurely dissipative Vlasov equation using GHK bracket\n\nFollowing GHK, we introduce a particle distribution which depends not only on the position\nand momentum coordinates q and p, but also on an extra coordinate g associated with, e.g.,\norientation or some other order parameter. The coordinate g belongs to the dual g\u2217 of the\nLie algebra g of the order parameter group G, which for anisotropic interactions is G = SO(3).\nFor an introduction to this approach in the theory of complex fluids, see [Ho2002]. In what\nfollows, we shall formulate the problem in the general context and analyze the case of rotations\nseparately. In the non-dissipative case, the Vlasov equation is written in terms of a Poisson\nbracket, which is the direct sum of the canonical (q, p)-bracket and the Lie-Poisson bracket on\nthe dual Lie algebra g\u2217 . Explicitly, this Poisson bracket is written as (1.3). Like in the isotropic\ncase, the non-dissipative Vlasov equation now becomes\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03b4H\n\u2202f\n= \u2212 f,\n,\n\u2202t\n\u2202f 1\nAnalogously to the isotropic case, the above Vlasov equation is determined by the Lie-algebra\naction h*f := {f, h}1 of phase-space functions h on phase-space distributions f . The corresponding dual operation (\u22c6) is given by (f \u22c6 k, h) = (k, \u2212 h * f ) = ( k, {h, f }1 ) = ( {f, k}1 , h ). Here\nwe have denoted by (*, *) the L2 pairing between functions and distributions on phase space and\nthe equality ( k, {h, f }1 ) = ( {f, k}1 , h ) follows from Leibniz rule for Poisson brackets. Thus,\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci Double bracket dissipation in kinetic theory October 29, 2018 11\nf \u22c6 k = {f, k}1 . Upon applying the same arguments as in the previous Section 2 and making use\nof the general formulation of the dissipative bracket (1.8), we find the purely dissipative Vlasov\nequation in double-bracket form (anisotropic DBV equation):\n\u001a \u001a\n\u001b\u001b\n\u2202f\n\u03b4E\n= f, \u03bc[f ],\n,\n(3.1)\n\u2202t\n\u2202f 1 1\nwhere we have dropped the sharp symbol. This equation has exactly the same form as in (1.2),\nbut now one replaces the canonical Poisson bracket {* , *} with the direct sum Poisson bracket\n{* , *}1 in (1.3). This formulation can now be used to derive the double-bracket dissipative version\nof the Vlasov equation for particles undergoing anisotropic interaction.\n\n3.2\n\nDissipative moment dynamics in 1D\n\nAn extension of the 1D moment dynamics hierarchy to include orientation dependence, may\nbe obtained by following the same steps as in the previous section, beginning by introducing\nthe moment quantities An (q, g) in (1.4). One may find the entire hierarchy of equations for\nthese moment quantities\nand then integrate over g in order to find theRequations for the mass\nR\ndensity \u03c1(q) := A0 (q, g) dg and the continuum charge density G(q) = g A0 (q, g) dg. Without\nthe integration over g, such an approach would yield the Smoluchowski approximation for the\ndensity A0 (q, g), usually denoted by \u03c1(q, g). This approach is developed in Sec. 4, where the\ndynamics of \u03c1(q, g) is presented explicitly.\nIn this section, we extend the Kupershmidt-Manin approach as in GHK to generate the\ndynamics of moments with respect to both momentum p and charge g. The main complication\nis that the Lie algebras of physical interest (such as so(3)) are not one-dimensional and in general\nare not commutative. Thus, in the general case one often introduces a multi-index notation as\nin [Ku1987, GiHoTr2005]. Rather, we introduce tensor powers g\u03bd := g \u2297 \u03bd = g \u2297 * * * \u2297 g. Then,\nthe moments are expressed as\nZ\nAn,\u03bd (q) := pn g\u03bd f (q, p, g) dp dg .\n(3.2)\nNote that all the integrals with respect to dp and dg are taken in finite-dimensional spaces and are\npresumed to exist according to Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2. This multi-dimensional treatment leads\nto cumbersome calculations [GiHoTr2008]. For the purposes of this section, we are primarily\ninterested in the equations\nfor \u03c1 and G; so we shall\nR\nR restrict our considerations to moments\nof the form An,0 = pn f (q, p, g) dp dg and An,1 = pn g f (q, p, g) dp dg. We write the single\ndenotes\nparticle Hamiltonian as h = \u03b4H/\u03b4f = pn g \u03bd \u03b4H/\u03b4An,\u03bd =: pn g\u03bd \u03b2n,\u03bd (q). Here\ntensor contraction between lower and upper indexes. We restrict our considerations to the case\n\u03bd = 0, 1. Consequently, we employ the following assumption.\nAssumption 3.1 The single-particle Hamiltonian h = \u03b4H/\u03b4f is linear in g and can be expressed in 1D as h(q, p, g) = pn \u03c8n (q) + pn g, \u03c8 n (q) , where \u03c8n (q) \u2208 R is a real scalar function\nand \u03c8 n (q) \u2208 R \u2297 g is a real Lie-algebra-valued function. This assumption will be used throughout\nthe rest of the paper.\n3.2.1\n\nDual Lie algebra action\n\n\b\nThe action of \u03b2n,\u03bd on f is defined as \u03b2n,\u03bd * f = pn g\u03bd \u03b2n,\u03bd , f 1 (no sum), where\ndenotes\ntensor contraction between lower and upper indexes. The dual of this action is denoted by\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci Double bracket dissipation in kinetic theory October 29, 2018 12\n(\u22c6n,\u03bd ).

Moreover, the notation ad\u2217\u03b1m,\u03c3 An,\u03c3+\u03bd above involves a tensor index contraction\n(arising from the contraction symbol in the second line of (3.3)) between the upper and lower\nLie algebra indexes. For example, in the simplest case one has ad\u2217\u03b10,1 A0,1 = (A0,1 )a \u2202q (\u03b10,1 )a .\nOnce the dual of the Lie algebra action is completely characterized, we can now write the\ndouble bracket structure for the moments An,\u03bd . This is done in the following discussion.\n3.2.2\n\nEvolution equations\n\nHaving characterized the dual Lie algebra action in (3.3), we may write the evolution equation\nfor an arbitrary functional F in terms of the dissipative bracket as follows:\n++\n**\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\nX\n\u03b4F\n\u03b4E \u266f\n(3.4)\n, f \u22c6n,\u03bd\n\u03bc[f ] \u22c6n,\u03bd\n\u1e1e = {{ F , E }} = \u2212\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\nn,\u03bd=0\n\nwhere the pairing hh * , * i is given by contraction of all upper and lower tensor indexes and integration over the spatial coordinate q. In \u0001the one dimensional case under\n\b consideration, we have\nexplicitly f \u22c6n,\u03bd \u03b4F /\u03b4f = f \u22c6n,\u03bd \u03b4F /\u03b4f i1 ,...,i\u03bd ei1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ei\u03bd , with ei being the basis in the\ndual of Lie algebra.\nWe now consider the lowest order by setting n = 0, 1 and excluding the case (n, \u03bd) = (1, 1) (we\nhave \u03bd = 0, 1 as before). This is exactly the same truncation that is involved, on the Hamiltonian\nside, in the Vlasov moment equations of chromohydrodynamics [GiHoKu1982, GiHoKu1983].\nThus, upon denoting k = \u03b4F/\u03b4f , we evaluate\nf \u22c60,0 k = ad\u2217\u03b1m,\u03c3 Am\u22121, \u03c3 = ad\u2217\u03b1m,0 Am\u22121, 0 + ad\u2217\u03b1m,1 Am\u22121, 1\n\u0015\u001d\nZ \u001c \u0014\n\u2202Am\n, \u03b1m,1\ndg = ad\u2217\u03b1m,0 Am\u22121, 1 + ad\u2217\u03b1m,1 Am,1\nf \u22c60,1 k = ad\u2217\u03b1m,\u03c3 Am\u22121, \u03c3+1 + g g,\n\u2202g\n\nf \u22c61,0 k = ad\u2217\u03b1m,\u03c3 Am, \u03c3 = ad\u2217\u03b1m,0 Am, 0 + ad\u2217\u03b1m,1 Am, 1\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere k = pm g\u03c3 \u03b1m,\u03c3 (q) and we have truncated to consider only moments of the type Am,0\nand Am,1 .

At this point, we\nconsider the simplest case in which m = 0, so that the first two relations of (3.5) are f \u22c60,0 k = 0\nand f \u22c60,1 k = ad\u2217\u03b10,1 A0, 1 , while the third of (3.5) becomes\nf \u22c61,0 k = ad\u2217\u03b10,0 A0, 0 + ad\u2217\u03b10,1 A0, 1 = A0, 0 \u2202q \u03b10,0 + (A0, 1 )a \u2202q (\u03b10,1 )a .\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci Double bracket dissipation in kinetic theory October 29, 2018 13\nThe equation for the evolution of F = A0,\u03bb is found from the bracket (3.4) in the truncated form\n**\u0012\n++ **\u0012\n++\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u03b4E \u266f\n\u03b4F\n\u03b4F\n\u03b4E \u266f\n\u1e1e = {{ F , E }} = \u2212\n\u03bc[f ] \u22c60,1\n\u2212\n, f \u22c60,1\n, f \u22c61,0\n\u03bc[f ] \u22c61,0\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n**\u0012\n\u001c\n\u001c\n\u001d\u0013\u266f \u0012\n\u001d\u0013++\n\u2202\u03b20,0\n\u2202\u03b20,1\n\u2202\u03b10,0\n\u2202\u03b10,1\n=\u2212\n\u03bc0, 0\n+ \u03bc0,1 ,\n, A0, 0\n+ A0, 1 ,\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u001c\u001c\u0010\n\u001d\u001d\n\u0011\u266f\nad\u2217\u03b20,1 \u03bc0,1 , ad\u2217\u03b10,1 A0,1\n\u2212\nwhere the prime in the summation symbol stands for n 6= \u03bd and we have expanded\nR n \u03c3 \u03b4E/\u03b4f =\n\u03b20,0 +hg, \u03b20,1 i = \u03b4E/\u03b4A0,0 +hg, \u03b4E/\u03b4A0,1 i.

Thus, we\nhave derived the Gilbert dissipation term at the macroscopic level, starting from double-bracket\ndissipative terms in the kinetic theory description. As far as we know, this is the first time that\nthe Gilbert dissipation term has been derived from a kinetic theory model.\n\n4\n\nSmoluchowski approach\n\nWe shall now turn our attention to the Smoluchowski approach for the description of the interaction of anisotropic particles. Usually, these particles are assumed to be rod-like, so their\norientation can be described by a point on a two-dimensional sphere S 2 [DoEd1988]. In this\npicture, one defines a distribution \u03c1(q, \u03a9, t) on the extended configuration space R3 \u00d7 S 2 , whose\ndynamics is usually regulated by the Smoluchowski equation\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03b4E\n\u03b4E\n\u2202\u03c1\n= divq \u03c1 \u03bcT (\u03c1) \u2207q\n+ div\u03a9 \u03c1 \u03bcO (\u03c1) \u2207\u03a9\n(4.1)\n\u2202t\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b4\u03c1\nwhere \u03bcT and \u03bcO are respectively the mobilities in the translational and orientational part and\nthe rotational gradient operator \u2207\u03a9 is expressed as \u2207\u03a9 = \u03a9 \u00d7 \u2202/\u2202\u03a9. Upon combining the\nprevious derivation of Darcy's law with the definition of the two different mobilities, one easily\nrecognizes that the above equations can be obtained by following the same steps as in Darcy's\nlaw. Two different mobilities \u03bcT and \u03bcO involving different smoothing kernels are allowed by\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci Double bracket dissipation in kinetic theory October 29, 2018 15\nthe particular Cartesian product structure of the configuration space R3 \u00d7 S 2 .

For the sake of simplicity, we\nshall not deal with such a distinction between these two types of mobilities.\nIn what follows, we shall consider particles of arbitrary shape, for which one needs the full\ngroup SO(3) to define their orientation. We shall work with the corresponding Lie algebra\nso(3) to conform to our theory. This construction particularly suits the dynamics of ferromagnetic\nparticles. Following the Smoluchowski approach, moments are defined as An (q, g) :=\nR n\np f (q, p, g) dp. As in the Kupershmidt-Manin approach, these moments are dual to \u03b2n (q, g),\nwhich are introduced by expanding the Hamiltonian function h(q, p, g) as h(q, p, g) = pn \u03b2n (q, g).\nSubstitution of these forms yields a Lie algebra bracket for the quantities \u03b2n given by [[\u03b2n , \u03b1m ]]1 =\n\u2032 ]i, where prime denotes partial derivative with respect to g and we have\n[[\u03b2n , \u03b1m ]] + hg, [\u03b2n\u2032 , \u03b1m\nused the same notation as in Section 2.2. A substantial difficulty arises in this moment hierarchy because the above Lie algebra structure does not allow for subalgebras, as happens for\nthe moments treated in the previous sections. Thus, there is no rigorous way of truncating\nthe hierarchy, which instead needs to be truncated by ad hoc physical arguments. However, in\nwhat follows we notice that Smoluchowski equation (for SO(3) orientations, or ferromagnetic\nparticles) can be obtained by taking the zero-th order moment A0 (q, g) of the oriented DBV\nequation.\n\n4.1\n\nA cold-plasma closure and its dissipative dynamics\n\nWe shallR apply the double bracket approach to the following equations\nR for the fluid momentum\nm(q) = p f (q, p, g) dp dg and the probability distribution \u03c1(q, g) = f (q, p, g) dp = A0 (q, g) in\nthe orientation g \u2208 g\u2217 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001c \u0014\n\u0015\u001d\nZ\n\u2202 \u03b4H\n\u2202 \u03b4H\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202 \u03b4H\n\u03b4H\n\u2202m \u03b4H \u2202m\n+\n+ 2m\n=\u2212 \u03c1\ndg ,\n+\n,\n\u03c1\n= \u2212 g,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4m \u2202q\n\u2202q \u03b4m\n\u2202q \u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\u03b4m\n\u2202g \u2202g \u03b4\u03c1\nThese equations arise from the Vlasov cold-plasma solution\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm(q)\nf (q, p, g) = \u03c1(q, g) \u03b4 p \u2212 R\n\u03c1(q, g) dg\n\nand their Hamiltonian\nstructure is directly inherited from the GHK-Vlasov bracket [GiHoKu1983]\nR \b\n{F, H} = f \u03b4F /\u03b4f , \u03b4H/\u03b4f 1 dq dp dg , by direct substitution of the chain rule formula \u03b4F /\u03b4f =\n\u03b4F /\u03b4\u03c1 + p \u03b4F /\u03b4m for generic functionals F and H.\nIn this picture, the Lie algebra action of the variable (\u03c6(q, g), u(q)) \u2208 C \u221e (Q \u00d7 g\u2217 ) \u00d7 X(Q)\nis given by (\u03c6, u) * f = {f, \u03c6 + p u}1 and its dual action is given by\n\u0013\n\u001d\nZ\nD\nE\nD\nE \u001c\u0012Z\nf \u22c6 k, (\u03c6, u) := \u2212 k, (\u03c6, u) * f =\n{f, k}1 dp, p {f, k}1 dp dg , (\u03c6, u) ,\n\u2217 )\u00d7X(Q))\u2217 \u2192 R between fluid and\nwhere the last pairing h * , * i : (C \u221e (Q\u00d7g\u2217 )\u00d7X(Q))\u00d7(C \u221e (Q\u00d7g\nR\nR\nparticle variables is defined as the sum (\u03c1, m), (\u03c6, u) = \u03c1(q, g) \u03c6(q, g) dq dg + m(q) u(q) dq.\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci Double bracket dissipation in kinetic theory October 29, 2018 16\nMore explicitly, the star operator is defined for k(q, p, g) = \u03c8(q, g) + pv(q) as\n\u0012\n\u001c \u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\u001d\nZ\n\u2202(\u03c1v)\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202v\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202m\nf \u22c6k = \u2212\n+ g,\n,\n+ 2m\n+ \u03c1\ndg .\n, v\n\u2202q\n\u2202g \u2202g\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\n(4.3)\n\nAt this point, we are ready to introduce the dissipative bracket by\n*\u0012\n+\n\u0013\n\u03b4E \u266f\n\u03b4F\n\u1e1e = {{F, E}} = \u2212\n\u03bc[f ] \u22c6\n,f\u22c6\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n*\u0012\u001c \u0014\n\u0013\u266f \u0012\u001c \u0014\n\u0013+\n\u0015\u001d Z\n\u0015\u001d Z\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202 \u03b4F\n\u2202 \u03b4E\n\u2202 \u03b4F\n\u2202\u03bc\u03c1 \u2202 \u03b4E\ng,\n(4.4)\n,\ndg ,\n,\ndg\n, \u03bc\u03c1\n, \u03c1\n=\u2212\ng,\n\u2202g \u2202g \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202q \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202g \u2202g \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202q \u2202\u03c1\nR\nwhere \u03bc\u03c1 = \u03bc dp.

By\nusing thisRevolution equation for an arbitrary functional F , the rate of change for zero-th moment\n\u03c1(q, g) = f (q, p, g) dp is found to be\n\u0013 ( \u001a\n\u0012 Z\n\u001b )\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\n\u03b4E\n\u2202 \u03b4E\n=\ndg + \u03c1, \u03bc\u03c1 ,\n\u03c1 \u03bc\u03c1\n,\n(4.5)\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\u2202q \u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b4\u03c1 g\u2217 \u2217\ng\n\nwhere we have introduced the notation {*, *}g\u2217 for the Lie-Poisson bracket {\u03c6, \u03c8}g\u2217 := hg, [\u2202 g \u03c6 , \u2202 g \u03c8]i.\nThe novel feature of equation (4.5) is the integral appearing in the expression of Darcy's velocity\n(first term of the right hand side). While ordinary Smoluchowski equations treat the translational and orientational coordinates on the same level, equation (4.5) treats these coordinates\nfrom two very different perspectives, while retaining the Yang-Mills charge nature of the orientation coordinate g. This reflects in the appearance of the integral over the orientation g that\nproduces a velocity vector field defined on the manifold Q. Such an integral is not present in\nconventional Smoluchowski approaches.\nRemark 4.1 (Higher dimensions) Analogously to remark 3.3, we can also write the three\ndimensional version of equation (4.5). This reads as\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013 ( \u001a\n\u001b )\n\u03b4E\n\u03b4E\n\u2202\u03c1\n= div \u03c1 \u03bc\u03c1 \u2207\nd\u03bc + \u03c1, \u03bc\u03c1 ,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b4\u03c1 g\u2217 \u2217\ng\n\n4.2\n\nSingular solutions\n\nBoth conventional Smoluchowski equation (4.1) and equation (4.5) possess delta-function solutions of the type \u03c1(q, g) = \u0393 \u03b4(q \u2212 Q(t)) \u03b4(g \u2212 G(t)), where \u0393 is a constant. This is the usual\nKlimontovich single particle solution. It is an open question whether such solutions emerge\nspontaneously. Another class of singular solutions is the following\n\u03c1(q, g) = w(g, t) \u03b4(q \u2212 Q(t)).\n\n(4.6)\n\nThis is a point particle solution that supports a kinetic equation for its own probability distribution w(g, t) in the space Den(g\u2217 ) of densities in the orientational degree of freedom g \u2208 g\u2217 . In\nthis case, the dynamical equations are\n( \u001a\n\u001b )\n\u2202w\n\u03b4E\n\u2202 \u03b4E\n,\n= w, \u03bc\u03c1 ,\nQ\u0307 = \u2212 \u03bc\u03c1\n\u2202q \u03b4\u03c1 q=Q\n\u2202t\n\u03b4\u03c1 g\u2217 \u2217\ng\n\nq=Q\n\nThis is a coupled system for the ODE regulating the particle trajectory Q(t) and the PDE\ngoverning the orientational probability w(g, t). To our knowledge, this class of singular solutions\nis new.\n\n\fHolm, Putkaradze, Tronci Double bracket dissipation in kinetic theory October 29, 2018 17\n\n5\n\nSummary and outlook\n\nThe double-bracket Vlasov moment dynamics discussed here has provided an alternative to both\nthe variational-geometric approach of [HoPu2007] and the Smoluchowski approach reviewed in\n[Co2005]. These are early days in this study of the benefits afforded by the double-bracket\napproach to Vlasov moment dynamics. However, the derivations of the Darcy law in (2.8) and\nthe Gilbert dissipation term in (3.11) by this approach lends hope that this direction will provide\nthe systematic derivations needed for modern technology of macroscopic models for microscopic\nprocesses involving interactions of particles that depend on their relative orientations. Although\nsome of these formulas may look daunting, they possess an internal consistency and systematic\nderivation that we believe is worth pursuing further. Our next steps will be the following: 1)\nperform the analysis of the mobility functionals in kinetic space \u03bc[f ] as well as the mobilities for\neach particular geometric quantity \u03bc\u03c1 , \u03bcG , etc.; 2) determine the conditions for the emergence\nof weak solutions (singularities) in the macroscopic (averaged) equations.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors were partially supported by NSF grants NSF-DMS-05377891 and NSF-DMS-09087551.\nThe work of DDH was also partially supported by the Royal Society of London Wolfson Research\nMerit Award.\n\nReferences\n[Ar1966] Arnold, V.
