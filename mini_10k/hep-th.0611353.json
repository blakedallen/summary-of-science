Introduction\nRecent developments in flux compactification in string theory have provided us with\nmany explicit realizations of the brane world scenario with stabilized moduli [1, 2].\nIn a typical solution in type IIB theory, the compactified manifold has a number of\nwarped throats. It is likely that our standard model particles are open string modes\nof a stack of D-branes sitting at the bottom of such a throat. A prime example\nof such a throat is the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) throat [3]; i.e., a warped deformed\nconifold in type IIB theory on AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 background. Its gauge theory dual is\nN = 1 supersymmetric SU(N + M) \u00d7 SU(N) with bifundamental chiral superfields\nand a quartic tree level superpotential which undergoes a cascade of Seiberg duality\ntransformations [4]. Here, we like to explore the properties of such a throat in some\ndetails. We will start with studying the running of the couplings in the gauge theory\nand calculate corrections to the anomalous mass dimension which dictate the flow of\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fthe gauge theory. The corrections depend on the ranks of the gauge groups in the\nduality cascade. We then apply gauge/gravity duality and find that including the\ncorrections to the anomalous dimension on the gauge theory side reveals step-like\nstructures in the metric and the fluxes on the gravity side.\nThese steps may be observable in cosmology. Implications of sharp features\nand/or non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background radiation due to steps\nin the inflaton potential have been studied [5, 6]. It has become clear that the brane\ninflationary scenario in string theory is quite robust [7]. Here, the inflaton is simply\nthe position of the D3-brane. In the simple but realistic KKLMMT scenario, inflation\ntakes place as a D3-brane moves down a warped throat [8]. The duality cascade\nfeature shows up in the D3-brane potential in the warped geometry as steps. Such\nsteps in the inflaton potential can introduce sharp features in the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation, which may have been observed already [9, 10]. So the steps in\nthe throat, though small, can have distinct observable stringy signatures in the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation. This point is perhaps best expressed by quoting\nWMAP [11] : \"a very small fractional change in the inflaton potential amplitude,\nc \u223c 0.1%, is sufficient to cause sharp features in the angular power spectrum.\"\nThe possibility of detecting and measuring the duality cascade is a strong enough\nmotivation to study the throat more carefully. Although both Seiberg duality and\ngauge/gravity duality are strongly believed to be true, neither has been proven; so a\ncosmological test is highly desirable. This will also provide strong evidence for string\ntheory. The steps also show up in the Dirac-Born-Infeld action for brane inflation,\nwhich may be observed separately [12].\nTo find the step structure on the gravity side, we shall use a gauge/gravity\nduality mapping between the couplings in the gauge theory and the dilaton and\nthe backreaction potential in the gravity theory. On the gauge theory side, as the\ntheory flows towards the infrared (IR), the larger of the two gauge factors undergoes\na Seiberg duality transition as it becomes strongly coupled while the weaker factor is\ntreated as a flavor symmetry: SU(N + M) with 2N flavors \u2192 SU(2N \u2212 (N + M)) =\nSU(N \u2212 M) with 2N flavors [4]. Repeating such transformation, the SU(N + M) \u00d7\nSU(N) gauge theory undergoes a series of Seiberg duality transitions as it flows\ntowards the IR; i.e., the bottom of the throat. This is the duality cascade. At the\nlth step (l = 1, 2, ...), the gauge theory makes the transition from the lth region;\ni.e., SU(N + M \u2212 (l \u2212 1)M) \u00d7 SU(N \u2212 (l \u2212 1)M) to the (l + 1)th region with\nSU(N + M \u2212 lM) \u00d7 SU(N \u2212 lM) gauge group. This duality cascade should lead to\nsteps in the fluxes and the metric in the gravity side. To see this, let us first look at\nthe value of the anomalous mass dimension \u03b3, since the renormalization group flow\nof the couplings depends crucially on it. The M = 0 case is the conformal KlebanovWitten (KW) model [13], where \u03b30 = \u22121/2. Turning on M breaks the conformal\nsymmetry and so should lead to a correction to \u03b3. Intuitively, when N \u226b M, this\ncorrection is expected to be small and so is usually neglected. Here we find interesting\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fphysics associated with this correction to the anomalous dimension. Furthermore,\nthis correction becomes substantial as we approach the IR limit.\nSince the gauge theory has the discrete symmetry M \u2192 \u2212M, N \u2192 N + M, \u03b3\nmust be even under this symmetry and so its leading order correction must have the\nform M 2 /N(N + M). On the other hand, if we turn off the superpotential, the two\ngauge couplings will have individual fixed points (when the other group is weakly\ncoupled and is treated as a flavor symmetry) provided \u03b3N +M = \u22121/2 \u2212 3M/2N and\n\u03b3N = \u22121/2+3M/2(N +M), respectively. So, when the superpotential is turned back\non, we expect the common \u03b3 to be somewhere in between, and the renormalization\ngroup flow of the couplings take place somewhere in between too. Since the above\nsymmetry maps \u03b3N +M and \u03b3N into each other, we propose that \u03b3 should be the\nsymmetrization (i.e., average) of \u03b3N +M and \u03b3N . Similarly, after l steps in the Seiberg\nduality cascade, the gauge theory becomes SU(N + M \u2212 lM) \u00d7 SU(N \u2212 lM), with\nthe corresponding anomalous dimension,\n1\n3M 2\n1\n3M 2\n\u03b3=\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\u2212 \u2212\n2 4N(N + M)\n2 4(N \u2212 lM)(N + M \u2212 lM)\n\n(1.1)\n\nThus \u03b3 jumps from one value to another value as the renormalization group flow\npasses a Seiberg duality transition. It is this jump in \u03b3 which causes the steps in\nthe metric and in the fluxes on the gravity side as one moves towards small r, which\nis roughly the distance away from the bottom of the throat. Note that, towards\nthe bottom of the throat, l \u2192 N/M, the correction in \u03b3 is no longer negligible.\nFor the anomalous dimension to stay finite in the N = KM case, l = 1, 2, ..., K \u2212\n1. That is, there are only K \u2212 1 steps in the Seiberg duality cascade, and the\ninfrared flow from SU(3M) \u00d7 SU(2M) to SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) takes \u03b3 = \u22127/8. Of\ncourse, higher order corrections may be important when l is large (i.e., when the\neffective K is not large). Note that the correction term in (1.1) blows up for l =\nK. This divergence leads to an infinite size step. Since higher order corrections\nhave to obey the above discrete symmetry, they will diverge here too. This may\nsignal a breakdown of perturbative corrections to the anomalous dimension in powers\nof M 2 /(N \u2212 lM)(N + M \u2212 lM). Alternatively, to avoid this divergence, this may\nsignal that the Seiberg duality transition stops at SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M). This latter\ninterpretation means that the theory flows to a baryonic branch rather than to a\nconfining branch.\nIn the absence of the corrections to the anomalous mass dimension (1.1), the\nSeiberg duality cascade is completely smooth when one looks at the geometry in\nthe supergravity side. On the gauge theory side, we see that one of the gauge\ncouplings in the renormalization group flow goes from small to large between duality\ntransformations. Since the anomalous dimension comes in the flow of the dilaton\nand the backreaction potential and its magnitude changes across Seiberg duality\ntransitions, the warp factor has steps on the supergravity side. Of course, each step\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fshould have a width (proportional to the step position), so that steps are actually\nsmoothed out. The resulting warp factor has a cascading behavior that agrees with\nthe picture presented in Ref.[14].\nLet us consider the structure in the warp metric h(r) that rescales masses, where\n2\nds = h2 (r)dx\u03bc dx\u03bc + h\u22122 (r)(dr 2 + r 2 ds25 ) and h(r) \u223c r. The size of the step at r = rp\nin the warp factor h(r) for large p < K (where r = rK+1 is at the edge of the throat)\nis estimated perturbatively to be (with string coupling gs valued at the step),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206h(rp )\nh> (rp ) \u2212 h< (rp )\n3gs M 1\n=\n\u2243\n.\n(1.2)\nh(rp )\nh(rp )\n2\u03c0\np3\nwhere h> (rp ) is the warp factor at r \u2265 rp and h< (rp ) that at r \u2264 rp . Although the\nsteps appear as infinitely sharp, this is clearly a consequence of the approximation\nused here. In reality, we expect the steps to have widths, so the warp factor has a\ncascading feature. We expect the sharpness of a step to be dictated by the strong\ninteraction scale \u039b there. So, in general, we expect this multi-step feature to be\ngeneric; as we approach the infrared (decreasing r), the step size grows (as p decreases) and becomes sharper (as \u039b \u223c r decreases). The spacings between steps are\nroughly equal as a function of ln r for large effective p. These features may show up\nin brane inflation as signature of the Seiberg duality transition and the gauge/gravity\nduality in string theory.\nNote that the anomalous dimension (1.1) is not the result of a rigorous derivation.\nWe expect that further improvement on the anomalous dimension will introduce a\n\u039b dependence. Since the warp factor we have here is not from an explicit solution of\nthe SUGRA equations, and we do expect a correction to the gauge/gravity duality\ndictionary that is not included here, so the result presented here should be treated\nas tentative only. Also, the quantitative properties of the warp factor (and so the\ninflaton potential) may be sensitively dependent on the details of the warped geometry of the throat. On the other hand, this cascading feature should be quite generic\neven if VD3 itself can be quite sensitive to the details of the model.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. First we give a brief background\nreview. We then present the details on the determination of the anomalous mass\ndimension and its implications on the renormalization group flow. A study of the\nimplication in the gravity side is done on the setting of a singular conifold which is\na good approximation to the deformed geometry in the UV region near the edge of\nthe throat. This is good enough for our purpose here as it captures the important\nfeatures of the physics: the steps with their order of magnitudes and radial locations.\nWe see that the dilaton and the 2-form NS-NS potential run with kinks and the NSNS flux has steps. This leads to steps in the warp factor. We write down the\nD3-brane world volume action, which is suitable for the study of new features in\nthe KKLMMT inflationary scenario. We comment on the mapping of the flow of the\ngauge theory to the supergravity flow, suggesting that the mapping/dictionary in the\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fgauge/gravity duality should have corrections as well. We will then continue with\nanalyzing the supergravity side using SU(3) structures and see how the corrections\non the gauge theory side could give rise to geometric obstructions on the supergravity\nside which provide special locations and sources for Seiberg duality transformations.\nA full supersymmetric solution on the supergravity side containing the corrections\nwill involve a detailed analysis of the supergravity equations of motion and their\nsolutions and we will not attempt to do that here. We will conclude with some\nremarks.\n\n2. Brief review\nKlebanov and Witten found, shortly after the first example of a dual gauge/gravity\ntheory was given by Maldacena [15], Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov [16], and Witten [17], that type IIB string theory with a stack of N D3-branes on AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1\nwas dual to N = 1 supersymmetric SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) conformal gauge theory with\n \u0304 and B1 and B2\nbifundamental chiral superfields A1 and A2 transforming as (\u0003, \u0003)\n \u0304 \u0003) and a quartic tree level superpotential [13]. The quartic tree\ntransforming as (\u0003,\nlevel superpotential in this theory is given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nWtree = w (A1 B1 )(A2 B2 ) \u2212 (A1 B2 )(A2 B1 ) ,\n(2.1)\n\nwhere color indices from the same gauge group are contracted and w is the tree\nlevel coupling. Let us define the classical dimensionless coupling related to the tree\nlevel coupling w by \u03b7 = ln(w/\u03bc1+2\u03b3\u03b7 ), where \u03bc has the dimension of mass. The\nphysical \u03b2 functions of the two gauge couplings are \u03b2g = 3N \u2212 2N(1 \u2212 \u03b3g ), and\nthat of \u03b7 is given by \u03b2\u03b7 = 1 + 2\u03b3\u03b7 , where the \u03b3s are the anomalous mass dimensions.\nAlthough the superpotential breaks the flavor symmetry to its diagonal version, there\nis enough symmetry left so that there is a common anomalous mass dimension, that\nis, \u03b3 = \u03b3\u03b7 = \u03b3g . The theory has a nontrivial conformal fixed point, where the\nphysical \u03b2 functions of the two gauge couplings associated to the two group factors\nin SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) and that of \u03b7 all vanish. This happens for the same value of the\nanomalous mass dimension, namely \u03b30 = \u22121/2. So the theory is conformal with this\nvalue of \u03b3, which is independent of N. The stack of D3-branes induces a 5-form R-R\nflux and the supergravity geometry is a warped pure AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 .\nIn the KS construction, in a series of papers by Klebanov and collaborators\n(with Gubser [18], with Nekrasov [19], with Tseytlin [20] and with Strassler [3]), an\nadditional M number of D5-branes are wrapped near the tip over the S 2 cycle of\nT 1,1 . See [21] for a review. These wrapped D5-branes become fractional D3-branes\nlocalized at the apex of the conifold. This enhances the gauge theory to SU(N +M)\u00d7\n \u0304 and B1 , B2 \u223c (\u0003,\n \u0304 \u0003). This theory with the quartic\nSU(N) with A1 , A2 \u223c (\u0003, \u0003)\ntree level superpotential given by (2.1) is dual to type IIB string theory on a warped\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fdeformed conifold, with AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 background. In this case, there is no value of\ncommon anomalous dimension that makes the physical \u03b2 functions of the couplings\nvanish simultaneously; that is, the addition of the fractional branes makes the theory\nnonconformal. The fractional branes induce 3-form R-R flux through the S 3 cycle of\nT 1,1 . This flux, considered as a perturbation of the AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 background, induces\na 2-form backreaction potential which varies with the radius of the T 1,1 and produces\na logarithmic flow. It was argued that this theory undergoes a cascade of Seiberg\nduality transformations with the duality transformation alternating between the two\ngauge group factors. The flow of the couplings would continue until, in the case where\nN is integral multiple of M, SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) is left. At this point two different\npossible routes are discussed in the literature. In one case, a pure SU(M) gauge\ntheory is left in the infrared which undergoes confinement via gaugino condensation\n[3]. On the string theory side, the confinement corresponds to a deformation of the\ntip of the cone via geometric transition whereby the S 2 cycle is blown-down and the\nS 3 is blown-up with 3-form R-R flux through it. There is also a second possible route\nfor the cascade ending in a baryonic branch of SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) with a quantum\ndeformed moduli space and a massless axionic moduli field [22]. Our work here\nconfirms that the second route is the preferred one.\nAssuming that the duality cascade picture is a correct description of the gauge\ntheory, we start with determining the corrections to the anomalous dimension. Once\nwe find the corrections to the anomalous dimension, we will study the effects on\nthe supergravity side on the setting of the singular conifold. The singular conifold\ngeometry is a good approximate description in the UV region near the edge of the\nthroat which is enough for our purpose of finding the steps and the corresponding\nsizes. We find that the leading corrections in M/N come at orders expected from\nflux backreaction estimates. For instance, the leading order correction to the anomalous mass dimension comes at O(M 2 /N 2 ), the gauge coupling \u03b2 functions receive\nleading O(M 2 /N) corrections and the dilaton runs at O(M 2 /N). This is consistent\nwith dual supergravity flux backreaction estimates [19, 20] where the leading order\ncorrections to the anomalous dimension is expected to come at most at O(M 2 /N 2 ).\nThe magnitude of the corrections changes after each duality transformation as the\nmatter content of the theory changes and this introduces steps in the backreaction\nH3 flux and in the warp factor. In e\u2212\u03a6 for the dilaton and in the B2 NS-NS potential,\nit is the slope in the logarithmic running which changes at the cascade steps. The\ncorrections grow as the cascade proceeds and the difference in the ranks of the gauge\ngroups gets bigger. Our premise of a changing anomalous dimension as the duality\ncascade proceeds and the matter content of the theory changes is consistent with the\npicture of the theory flowing to the baryonic branch with SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M). Here\nthe reason for the flow to a baryonic branch is because an additional Seiberg duality\ntransformation would require an infinite \"charge\" at the step.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f3. Seiberg duality cascade\nLet us consider the N = 1 supersymmetric SU(N + M) \u00d7 SU(N) gauge theory with\n \u0304 and B1 , B2 \u223c (\u0003,\n \u0304 \u0003) in the KS\nchiral superfields transforming as A1 , A2 \u223c (\u0003, \u0003)\nconstruction. The quantity \u03b3 = \u03b3A + \u03b3B stands for the anomalous dimension of any\none of the objects (Ai Bj ) made out of the bifundamental chiral superfields, which\ncontains one A and one B superfields and which must have the same anomalous\ndimension because of SU(2) global flavor symmetry in the theory. Let us denote the\ngauge coupling of the larger group, which is SU(N + M) in the 1st region, by g1 ,\nand that of the smaller group, which is SU(N) in the 1st region, by g2 , and define\nT1 \u2261 \u22122\u03c0i\u03c41 = 8\u03c0 2 /g12 and T2 \u2261 \u22122\u03c0i\u03c42 = 8\u03c0 2 /g22 . Suppose we start with taking one\ngauge group as a weakly coupled gauge theory relative to the other, then we can treat\nthat weaker group as a flavor symmetry. The running of the physical couplings [23]\nwith appropriate normalization of the gauge chiral superfields can then be written\nas\ndT1 (1)\n\u03b21 = \u03bc\n= 3(N + M) \u2212 2N(1 \u2212 \u03b31 (1)),\n(3.1)\nd\u03bc\n\u03b22 = \u03bc\n\ndT2 (1)\n= 3N \u2212 2(N + M)(1 \u2212 \u03b32 (1)),\nd\u03bc\n\n(3.2)\n\nd\u03b7(1)\n= 1 + 2\u03b3\u03b7 (1),\nd\u03bc\n\n(3.3)\n\nand\n\u03b2\u03b7 = \u03bc\n\nwhere we have not yet identified the \u03b3s. We have put different indices on \u03b31 (l) in\n(3.1), on \u03b32 (l) in (3.2) and on \u03b3\u03b7 (l) in (3.3) since the two gauge groups have different\nranks and \"see\" different numbers of flavors and would tend to flow with different\nanomalous dimensions. The number \"1\" in the parentheses denotes the l = 1st\nregion, in the UV region just before the first duality transformation in the cascade.\nAccording to Seiberg duality, N = 1 supersymmetric SU(N) electric gauge\ntheory with Nf \u2208 (3N/2, 3N) flavors, which becomes strongly coupled in the IR, flows\nto a nontrivial conformal IR fixed point where it joins a dual SU(Nf \u2212 N) magnetic\ngauge theory with Nf flavors. Now if we consider the SU(N + M) gauge theory\nand think of the other SU(N) gauge group as a weakly gauged flavor symmetry,\nwe have N = 1 supersymmetric SU(N + M) gauge theory with 2N flavors; its\nrunning is faster than the running of an SU(N) gauge theory with 2(N + M) flavors.\nTherefore, the SU(N + M) gauge theory would get strongly coupled faster in the\nIR and following Seiberg duality the appropriate description of the theory in this\nregion is in terms of a weaker dual magnetic theory. The question of interest to us\nis the effective value of the anomalous dimension which dictates the flow. Although\nit is the SU(N + M) factor that undergoes duality transformation in the first step\nof the cascade, the flow cannot be dictated simply by the fixed point of SU(N + M)\ngauge theory with 2N flavors for two reasons. First, the SU(N) group factor which\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fgives a flavor symmetry to SU(N + M) would itself get strongly coupled during\npart of the flow. Second, the running of the tree level coupling has a fixed point for\nanomalous dimension \u03b3\u03b7 = \u22121/2. In fact, if we consider the two flows separately, the\nSU(N + M) factor tends to make \u03b3 < \u22121/2 while the SU(N) factor tends to make\n\u03b3 > \u22121/2, and the strengths are slightly different and that is where the corrections\nto the anomalous dimension will originate. Consider the non-trivial IR fixed point of\nthe gauge couplings in the nonperturbative regime. The anomalous dimension \u03b31 (1)\nthat would follow from the fixed point of SU(N + M) with 2N flavors (\u03b21 = 0) is\n1 3M\n.\n\u03b31 (1) = \u2212 \u2212\n2 2N\n\n(3.4)\n\nSimilarly, the anomalous dimension \u03b32 (1) that would follow from the fixed point of\nSU(N) with 2(N + M) flavors (\u03b22 = 0) is\n1 3 M\n\u03b32 (1) = \u2212 +\n.\n2 2N +M\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe duality transformation in the first step of the cascade occurs in the SU(N +\nM) factor because it would run faster, when the two gauge factors are looked at\nseparately. In terms of the anomalous dimensions, it receives more deviation from\n\u22121/2 than SU(N) does. The effective value of anomalous mass dimension which\nguides the running of the physical couplings should lie somewhere in between. The\ngauge theory has the obvious symmetry M \u2192 \u2212M, N \u2192 N + M. Clearly, \u03b3 should\nbe even under this symmetry and so cannot depend on M/N at first order. Note\nthat this symmetry M \u2192 \u2212M, N \u2192 N + M interchanges \u03b31 (1) (3.4) and \u03b32 (1) (3.5),\nso that their symmetrization is invariant under this symmetry, i.e.,\n1 3\nM2\n\u03b3(1) = \u2212 \u2212\n.\n2 4 N(N + M)\n\n(3.6)\n\nThat is, \u03b3 is the average of \u03b31 and \u03b32 . Indeed, we shall see that this leads to\nresults consistent with dual supergravity flux backreaction estimates [19, 20] where\nthe leading order corrections to the anomalous dimension is expected to come at\nmost at O(M 2 /N 2 ). Moreover, it gives a picture with the duality cascade ending in\na baryonic branch consistent with the discussions in [22, 21, 24].\nNote that one may consider an alternative proposal that still preserves the above\nsymmetry. Since \u03b3\u03b7 = \u22121/2 already yields a vanishing \u03b2\u03b7 , \u03b3 = (\u03b31 + \u03b32 + c\u03b3\u03b7 )/(2 + c),\nso that the coefficient in the correction in the anomalous dimension (3.6) becomes\n3/4 \u2192 3/2(2 + c). For generic c, this coefficient remains non-zero and positive, so\nmost of the qualitative discussions below still hold.\nThe fact that correction in (3.6) comes in the form M 2 /(N(N + M)) is dictated\nby the M \u2192 \u2212M, N \u2192 N + M symmetry and the factor of \u22123/4 comes from\nthe assumption that the effective value of anomalous dimensions which dictates the\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fflow must lie between \u03b31 and \u03b32 and the averaging. Our conclusions including that\nthe gauge theory cascade ends in SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) depend on the form of M/N\ncombination dictated by symmetry. Corrections of order O(M/N) to the anomalous\ndimension were discussed in [14]. The corrections to the anomalous dimension we\nhave here come at order O(M 2 /N 2 ). Moreover, \u03b1\u2032 corrections of order O(M 4 /N 4 )\nnear the bottom of the throat were discussed in [25]. Our interest here is classical\nsupergravity and the constraints from the gauge/gravity duality are N \u226b 1, M \u226b 1,\ngs N \u226b 1 and fixed. One also needs gs M not to be too small to trust the supergravity\nside at smaller r where the ranks of the gauge groups become of order M. We still\nwant M to be a small perturbation on N, M \u226a N. Our correction is smallest in the\nearly stage of the flow where the rank of the gauge theory is SU(N +M)\u00d7SU(N) and\nstringy loop corrections would come at O(gs ) \u223c 1/N. Our corrections are bigger than\nloop corrections so far as 1/N < M 2 /N 2 or M 2 > N. In the bottom region of the\nthroat, where Neff \u223c M and the 't Hooft coupling is \u223c gs M, stringy loop corrections\nwould be O(gs ) \u223c 1/M and our corrections are bigger than loop corrections, since\n1/M < 1.\nThe resulting gauge theory after the first duality transformation is SU(N \u2212M)\u00d7\nSU(N) and now the running of the SU(N) factor would be faster and it is its turn\nfor a duality transformation as the renormalization group flows towards the IR. Now\nconsider the gauge group SU(N \u2212 (l \u2212 2)M) \u00d7 SU(N \u2212 (l \u2212 1)M) in the lth region\napproaching the lth step in the duality cascade. For odd l, it is the gauge group whose\nparent is the gauge factor SU(N + M) which undergoes a duality transformation,\nwhile for even l it is the one with the SU(N) parent. It is convenient to use g1 for\nthe stronger gauge coupling which corresponds to the gauge group that undergoes a\nduality transformation and g2 for the other from now on. Again treating one gauge\ngroup as a flavor symmetry to the other, we have, for the flow from the (l \u2212 1)th to\nlth duality transformations,\n1\n\u03b31 (l) = \u2212 \u2212 Cl\u22121 ,\n(3.7)\n2\n1\n(3.8)\n\u03b32 (l) = \u2212 + Cl\u22122 ,\n2\nwhere\n3 M\nCl \u2261\n.\n(3.9)\n2 N \u2212 lM\nThe anomalous dimension for the lth region in the cascade then follows from the\nsymmetrization of the two,\n1\n3M 2\n1 1\n.\n\u03b3(l) = \u2212 \u2212 Cl\u22122 Cl\u22121 = \u2212 \u2212\n2 3\n2 4(N + 2M \u2212 lM)(N + M \u2212 lM)\n\n(3.10)\n\nNow we are ready to identify the effective values of anomalous dimensions which\ndictate the flow,\n\u03b31 (l)eff = \u03b32 (l)eff = \u03b3\u03b7 (l)eff = \u03b3(l).\n(3.11)\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fWith this common value of \u03b3(l) given by (3.10), (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3) become\ndT1 (l)\n= 3M \u2212 Cl\u22122 M,\nd\u03bc\n\n(3.12)\n\ndT2 (l)\n= \u22123M \u2212 Cl\u22121 M,\nd\u03bc\n\n(3.13)\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n2\nd\u03b7(l)\n= \u2212 Cl\u22122 Cl\u22121 .\n(3.14)\nd\u03bc\n3\nThus, the effective running of the couplings makes g1 get stronger while g2 gets\nweaker as the theory flows to the IR. In some region during the flow the two couplings have about equal strength. The dimensionless tree level coupling w after the\nduality transformation goes like the inverse of that before the transformation and the\ncorresponding \u03b2 function changes sign. As the magnitude of the anomalous dimension across each step of the cascade changes because the changing matter content\nof the cascading theory, so do the coefficients in the logarithmic running of the couplings. We see from the \u03b2 functions in (3.12) and (3.13) that the physical running\nof the gauge couplings has appropriate feature with O(M 2 /N) corrections. We will\nlater discuss the running of the gauge couplings further.\nLet us check if the magnitudes of the anomalous mass dimensions we have here\nare within range for Seiberg duality. The mass dimension of O \u2261 (A1 B1 )(A2 B2 ) \u2212\n(A1 B2 )(A2 B1 ), d[O], for the flow from the lth to the (l + 1)th duality transition points\nis\n3M 2\nd[O] = 4 + 2\u03b3 = 3 \u2212\n.\n(3.15)\n2(N \u2212 lM)(N + M \u2212 lM)\n\u03bc\n\nFor the flow involving\n\nN\nM\n\n\u2212 1 duality transitions, we have\n2\n\n9\n4\n\n\u2264 d[O] \u2264 3 \u2212\n\n3\nM2\n.\n2 N (N +M )\n\nFor the mesons, 89 \u2264 d[(Ai Bj )] \u2264 32 \u2212 34 N (NM+M ) . Thus the operator O is relevant\nthroughout the flow. Note that the mesons have mass dimension d[(Ai Bj )] \u2265 89 and\nthis is consistent with the \u2265 1 bound for the mass dimension of scalars at a conformal\nfixed point. Here the theory flows nearby such a fixed point. The mass dimension\nN\nto 98 across the last ( M\n\u2212 1)th duality transition and a\nd[(Ai Bj )] changes from 11\n8\nfurther duality transformation would have made the mass dimension of the mesons\n< 1 which would be inconsistent. Here, d[(Ai Bj )] actually diverges for l = N/M.\nTo avoid this, the duality cascade should have only K \u2212 1 transitions and ends with\nSU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M).\n\n4. Supergravity side\n4.1 Type IIB supergravity action\nType IIB supergravity is the effective low energy background of type IIB strings.\nIn this section we want to review and write down a summary of the action and the\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fgeneral equations of motion of type IIB supergravity consisting the fields of interest\nto us here. The point here is to see the general relations among the fluxes and the\nmetric. At the same time we will see some of the special cases in which the equations\nreduce and become simpler to deal with directly.\nThe pair of 16 component spinors of N = 2 supersymmetry in ten dimensions\nhave the same chirality in IIB and the corresponding spinor representation can be\nwritten as 16 \u2295 16. The nonperturbative description of strings contains Dp-branes,\nwhich have p spatial and 1 time dimensions. In the IIB case, p is constrained to take\non odd numbers. Our interest here is IIB backgrounds in the presence of D3- and D5branes, and in particular on AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 background with the D5-branes wrapping\nthe S 2 cycle of T 1,1 near the tip. The gauge theory dual to this supergravity theory\nis a nonconformal N = 1 supersymmetric SU(N + M) \u00d7 SU(N) with bifundamental\nchiral superfields and a quartic tree level superpotential. The flow of the theory\ninduces a backreaction 2-form NS-NS potential. The relevant field content of type\nIIB supergravity are a dilaton \u03a6, RR 0-, 2- and 4-forms C0 , C2 and C4 , and NS-NS\n2-form B2 , with corresponding fluxes F1 = dC0 , F3 = dC2 , F5 = dC4 and H3 = dB2\n[26].

From (4.8) we see that the dilaton would be constant for\na precise matching of the H3 and F3 fluxes such that e\u2212\u03a6 H3 \u2227 \u22c6H3 = gs2 e\u03a6 F3 \u2227 \u22c6F3 .\nIn the case when the dilaton is taken constant, the equations of motion simplify and\nthe solution on a singular conifold was found by Klebanov and Tseytlin [20], with\nthe singularity at tip of the conifold where the radius of AdS5 (or T 1,1 ) vanishes.\nHowever, with the KS picture in terms of Seiberg duality cascade, confinement via\ngaugino condensation at the end of the cascade on the gauge theory side leads to\na deformed conifold with the tip being S 3 . In this case, the tip of the cone is\nsmoothed out and cut off at some finite r whose size depends of the magnitude of\nthe 't Hooft coupling in the confining gauge group, gs M, which is related to the\nglueball superfield [27] with expectation value related to the scale of the confining\ngauge theory. Thus one needs a metric and flux ansatz which takes into account the\ninterpolation between S 3 at the tip and the asymptotically S 2 \u00d7 S 3 geometry at large\nr. With a metric ansatz, one computes the Ricci scalar, and then equate it to (4.13)\nto determine the geometry and obtain the Klebanov-Tseytlin solution [20]. A second\nspecial case is where the NS-NS flux H3 is turned on by wrapping NS5-branes on S 2\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fwhile both R-R fluxes F5 and F3 vanish and the equations are simplified. Now we\ncannot have a constant dilaton, since the right hand side of (4.8) is nonzero. The\nsolution to this case with N = 1 supersymmetry was obtained by Maldacena and\nNunez (MN) [28, 29, 30]. The KS solution on the deformed conifold with F5 and F3\nfluxes turned on and the MN solution with the H3 flux turned on are two well-known\nregular solutions on type IIB background with N = 1 supersymmetry. A natural\nquestion was whether there existed a flow between them. The possibility for this was\nanalyzed and a metric and a flux ansatz for it given by Papadopoulos and Tseytlin\n[31]. This issue was further investigated by Gubser, Herzog and Klebanov [22] who\nfound a leading order perturbative solution around the KS solution. Butti, Grana,\nMinasian, Petrini, and Zaffaroni used SU(3) structures to find a one parameter set\nof numerical solutions which flow in a direction from KS to MN [24].\n4.2 Mapping gauge coupling running to supergravity flow\nIn this section we want to apply the gauge/gravity duality to map the renormalization\ngroup flow of the gauge couplings to the running of the dilaton and the backreaction\nNS-NS 2-form potential. We discuss how, with the inclusion of the corrections, the\ngauge couplings in their renormalization flow may stay finite throughout the duality\ncascade.\nThe stack of M D5-branes wrapping S 2 of the AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 background creates\n3-form flux through S 3 which induces a backreaction 2-form potential B2 in the S 2\ncycle. The sum of the two gauge coupling coefficients T+ \u2261 T1 + T2 , which can\nbe taken as the effective gauge coupling, is related to the effective string coupling\ncontaining the dilaton in the dual gravity theory. The difference between the two\ngauge coupling coefficients T\u2212 \u2261 T1 \u2212 T2 is nonzero because the ranks of the two\ngauge groups are different and it describes the nonconformal nature of the theory.\nIndeed, T\u2212 must dictate the flows in both the gauge and the gravity theories. We\nnote that the supergravity equation of motion in the presence of nonzero R-R F3 and\nF5 fluxes from the D3- and D5- branes could have a consistent set of solutions only\nif the NS-NS 2-form potential B2 is nonzero. Indeed, the two parameters T+ and T\u2212\non the gauge theory side are mapped to the effective string coupling and the 2-form\npotential B2 through the relations [19, 32],\n2\u03c0\n,\ngs e\u03a6\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nT1 \u2212 T2 =\n(\nb\u0302\n\u2212\n1)\n=\n(b\u03042 (mod 2))\ngs e\u03a6\ngs e\u03a6\nT1 + T2 =\n\n(4.14)\n(4.15)\n\nwhere\nand\n\nb\u0302 \u2212 1 = b\u03042 (mod 2),\n1\nb2 \u2261 2 \u2032\n2\u03c0 \u03b1\n\nb\u03042 = b2 \u2212 1,\n\nZ\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nS2\n\nB2 .\n\n(4.16)\n(4.17)\n\n\fT =\n\n8\u03c0 2\ng2\n\nSU\n\nT2\n\n(N\n\u2212\n\nM\n\n(2\n\nSU\n\n)\n\n)\n\n2)\nT 1(\n)\n(N\nU\nS\n\n(N\n\nSU\n\nT2\n\nb\u0302 = 2\n(1\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(N\n\n+\n\nM\n\n)\n\n(1)\nT1\n\nb\u0302 = 0\n\nln(r/r0)\nln(r2/r0)\n\nln(r1/r0 )\n\n0\n\nFigure 1: A schematic comparison of the flows of the couplings in SU (N + M ) \u00d7 SU (N )\nwithout the corrections (dashed lines) versus that with the corrections to the anomalous\nmass dimension (solid lines). Note that a Seiberg duality transition occurs when the flow\nof T\u2212 (1) = T1 (1) \u2212 T2 (1) reaches a period in b2 .\n\nThe variable b\u03042 measures the deviation of T\u2212 from zero due to the backreaction B2\npotential from where the two gauge couplings have equal magnitude in r1 < r < r0 .\nTherefore, the flow is such that b\u03042 = 0 at the first point where the two couplings are\nequal. We will arrange the supergravity flow such that b2 (r) vanishes at the edge of\nthe throat, r = r0 , and 0 \u2264 b\u0302 \u2264 2. Following from the quantization condition on H3 ,\n\u03c0b2 must be a periodic variable with period 2\u03c0. This periodicity is crucial for the\ncascade phenomenon. Note that b2 decreases as the theory flows towards the infrared\n(smaller r) and Seiberg duality takes place when b\u0302 \u2212 1 reaches \u22121. For r1 \u2264 r < r0 ,\nwe label the couplings as Ti (1), where \"1\" labels the fact that the flow is in the first\nregion, i.e., the couplings are for the SU(N + M) \u00d7 SU(N) gauge theory. We see\nfrom (3.12) and (3.13) that the running of T1 (1) and T2 (1),\n\u2202T1 (1)\n3 M2\n= 3M \u2212\n,\n\u2202\u03bc\n2N +M\n\n(4.18)\n\n\u2202T2 (1)\n3 M2\n= \u22123M \u2212\n,\n\u2202\u03bc\n2 N\n\n(4.19)\n\n3\nM3\n\u2202T\u2212 (1)\n= 6M +\n.\n\u2202\u03bc\n2 N(N + M)\n\n(4.20)\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\nThe flows are illustrated in Figure 1. Let us first consider the KS case without\nthe corrections to the anomalous mass dimension. Let us start at the value of r < r0\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fwhere b\u0302 = 1, b\u03042 = 0 or b2 = \u22121, so that the two gauge couplings are equal. The\ndilaton \u03a6 = 0 in KS and the running of T1,2 (1) is given by (4.18) and (4.19), with\n\u00b13M. As r decreases to r = r1 ,\nT1 \u2192 0,\n\nb\u0302 \u2192 0,\n\n(4.21)\n\nthat is, g1 \u2192 \u221e when b2 \u2192 \u22122. With our notation, b\u0302 takes values between 0 and\n2. At r = r1 , Seiberg duality transformation occurs, so T1 (1) \u2192 T2 (2) and T2 (1) \u2192\nT1 (2). Now the flows correspond to that of the gauge theory SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N \u2212 M),\nwhere T1 (2) starts decreasing (towards small r), that is, SU(N) is getting strongly\ninteracting. Seiberg duality transformation takes place when the strongly interacting\ncoupling g1 is infinite. On the other hand, the warped geometry in the supergravity\nside is completely smooth as we pass through such a duality transition.\nNow let us consider the case with the corrections included, with the flows of the\ncouplings given by (4.20) and schematically illustrated in Figure 1 as solid lines. We\nsee that T1 (1) is decreasing slower while T2 (1) is increasing faster as r decreases. Note\nalso that (4.20) shows that T\u2212 (1) is flowing faster so, starting at r where the two\ncouplings are equal in r1 < r < r0 , b2 reaches a period with the flow tilted with respect\nto the case without the corrections as shown in Figure 1, since the magnitude of the\nslope in the running of T2 is greater than T1 . The locations of duality transitions\nhappen to occur further away at smaller r with the running of both \u03a6 and b2 is taken\ninto account in the gauge/gravity duality mapping as shown in Figure 1. We will\nsee that from the values of rl in Section 5. The first duality transition occurs when\nthe effective number of D3-branes drops such that the stronger gauge group changes\nfrom rank N + M to rank N. This translates to a decrease in b2 by 2 units, which\ntakes place at small but finite T1 . For the flow from the (l \u2212 1)th to the lth cascade\nsteps we have (3.12) and (3.13),\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\nT+ = \u2212 Cl\u22122 + Cl\u22121 M,\nd ln(\u039b/\u039bc )\n\n(4.22)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\nT\u2212 = 6 + Cl\u22121 \u2212 Cl\u22122 M,\nd ln(\u039b/\u039bc )\n\n(4.23)\n\nwhere \u039b is the scale of the gauge theory and \u039bc is the cutoff. The scale of the gauge\ntheory is mapped to the radial coordinate r of AdS5 in the dual gravity theory, so\nwe have\n\u039b \u223c r.\n(4.24)\nWe note that the magnitude of the correction to the running of T\u2212 increases with\nincreasing l, since Cl\u22121 > Cl\u22122 . This increase in the coefficient of the logarithmic\nrunning of T\u2212 will lead to a change of the slope in the logarithmic running of the\nB2 potential which results in a step in the 3-form NS-NS flux H3 and in the warp\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\ffactor at a duality transformation. Applying the derivative with respect to ln(r/r0 )\non (4.14) and (4.15), we obtain\nd\ne\u2212\u03a6 = \u2212Sl ,\n(4.25)\nd ln (r/r0 )\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\ne\u2212\u03a6 b\u03042 = Dl ,\n(4.26)\nd ln (r/r0 )\nwhere r0 is the AdS5 radius at the edge of the throat and we have introduced two\nsets of constants,\nSl \u2261 (Cl\u22121 + Cl\u22122 )\n\ngs M\n,\n2\u03c0\n\nDl \u2261 (6 + Cl\u22121 \u2212 Cl\u22122 )\n\ngs M\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.27)\n\nNotice that S1 \u223c 1/K while the correction in D1 goes as 1/K 2 . Suppose the lth\nduality transformation takes place at r = rl . First we can solve (4.25) for \u03a6(r) in\nthe range r \u2265 r1 ,\ne\u2212\u03a6(r) = e\u2212\u03a60 \u2212 S1 ln(r/rs ) = 1 \u2212 S1 [ln(r/r0) \u2212 c1 ]\n\n(4.28)\n\nwhere \u03a60 may be absorbed into the definition of gs and c1 should be determined\nby an appropriate boundary condition. Note that we have chosen \u03a6(rs ) = \u03a60 at\nsome r = rs and e\u2212\u03a6(r0 ) = 1 + S1 c1 . We then have the solution for \u03a6 in the range\nrl \u2264 r \u2264 rl\u22121 between the (l \u2212 1)th and the lth duality transformation locations,\ne\u2212\u03a6(r) = 1 + S1 c1 \u2212\n\nl\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\nSk ln(rk /rk\u22121) \u2212 Sl ln(r/rl\u22121),\n\n(4.29)\n\nand \u039b/\u039bc = r/r0 . The values of rl will be computed using the change in magnitude\nof b2 . The leading term in the variation of e\u2212\u03a6 /gs with respect to ln(r/rl\u22121 ) comes\nat O(M 2 /N) consistent with flux backreaction expectations [19]. Note that near the\nbottom of the throat at r = rK\u22121 , using ln(rk /rk\u22121 ) \u223c \u22121/gs M which we will see\nPK\u22121\nSk ln(rk /rk\u22121) \u223c \u2212(gs M 2 /N)(\u22121/gs M)\nlater, we have e\u2212\u03a6(rK\u22121 ) \u2212 e\u2212\u03a6(r0 ) = \u2212 k=1\n(N/M) = O(1) and, therefore, the change in e\u2212\u03a6 from the edge to the bottom of the\nthroat is O(1).\nOur interest is first to show how kinks appear in the running of the dilaton and\nthe B2 potential which lead to steps in the H3 flux and in the warp factor. The\nexpressions we present are only approximate and good for the large r region. We\nwill not attempt to find the full supersymmetric solution on the supergravity side\non the deformed/resolved conifold here. We seek a UV approximate expression for\nb\u03042 (r) with b\u03042 (r0 ) = 1 (or b2 (r0 ) = 0) at the edge of the throat. This corresponds to\nthe case in which the gauge coupling g1 just starts getting stronger while g2 starts\ngetting weaker as the theory starts flowing down from the edge of the throat. We\nthen obtain from (4.26) for r in the range rl \u2264 r \u2264 rl\u22121 ,\ne\u2212\u03a6(r) b\u03042 (r) \u2248 e\u2212\u03a6(rl\u22121 ) b\u03042 (rl\u22121 ) + Dl ln(r/rl\u22121 ).\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n(4.30)\n\n\fThe lth duality transformation will occur at r = rl such that b\u03042 (rl ) = \u2212(2l \u22121). With\nthis and expressing ln(r/rl\u22121) in terms of \u03a6, (4.30) gives\n!\nl\u22121\nX\nD\nl\nSk ln(rk /rk\u22121 ) \u2212 e\u2212\u03a6(r) . (4.31)\ne\u2212\u03a6(r0 ) \u2212\ne\u2212\u03a6(r) b\u03042 (r) \u2248 \u2212(2l\u22123)e\u2212\u03a6(rl\u22121 ) +\nSl\nk=1\n\nThe 2-form potential for the same range of r then follows from (4.17) and (4.30),\nB2 (r) \u2248 b2 (r)\n\n\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\u03c92\n,\n2\n\n(4.32)\n\nwhere \u03c92 denotes the S 2 cycle in T 1,1 = S 2 \u00d7 S 3 . The corresponding 3-form NS-NS\nflux H3 = dB2 is, noting that \u2202b2 /\u2202r = \u2202 b\u03042 /\u2202r,\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u03c0\u03b1\u2032 dr \u2227 \u03c9\n2\n,\ne\u2212\u03a6(r) H3 (r) \u2248 Dl + Sl b\u03042 (r)\n2r\n\n(4.33)\n\nwhich has steps at Seiberg duality transformation locations, since the magnitudes of\nDl and Sl change across locations of duality transitions. Each time r decreases past\nrl , b\u03042 drops by 2, as implied by Seiberg duality and (4.15). Note also that the steps\nin the flux give steps in the metric as the two are related by equations such as (4.13).\nWe will study the steps in the warp factor in Section 5.\nFinally we like to point out that the dictionary in the mapping between couplings\nin the gauge and the gravity variables (4.14) and (4.15) should have corrections. Let\nus discuss this point in some detail here. First consider the above mapping by\nintroducing the variables\ngs e\u03a6\n(T1 + T2 ) = 1,\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.34)\n\ngs e\u03a6\n(T1 \u2212 T2 ) = b\u0302 \u2212 1\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.35)\n\nt+ = t1 + t2 =\nt\u2212 = t1 \u2212 t2 =\nSince\nb\u0302\nt1 = ,\n2\n\nt2 =\n\n2 \u2212 b\u0302\n2\n\n(4.36)\n\nand t1 , t2 \u2265 0, we see that 0 \u2264 b\u0302 \u2264 2 and 1 \u2265 t1 , t2 \u2265 0. (This is illustrated in Figure\n1.) Let us ignore corrections and start at the value of r < r0 where b\u0302 = 1 so that the\ntwo gauge couplings are equal. As r decreases to r = r1 ,\nt1 \u2192 0\n\nb\u0302 \u2192 0,\n\n(4.37)\n\nthat is, g1 \u2192 \u221e. In the KS case, the geometry is smooth as we cross the Seiberg\nduality transition point. With the corrections coming from the anomalous mass\ndimension we have here, the steps in the warp factor and the kinks in the dilaton\nintroduces discontinuities. Clearly, we expect such discontinuities to be smoothed out\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fby further correction terms. That is, we expect that the relations (4.14) and (4.15)\nshould be modified by corrections. For example, if the mapping (4.14) is not exact,\nthen we expect either a correction on the gravity side, or equivalently, a correction\non the gauge theory side. If the gravity side in (4.14) has a positive correction, either\ncoming from \u03b1\u2032 or quantum corrections, such a correction will allow the flow of g1\nto a large but finite value, as expected. We also expect the anomalous dimension to\ndepend on the scale \u039b \u223c r. Such corrections should smooth out the discontinuities\nin the warped geometry and the dilaton flow.\n\n5. Warp factor with steps\nWe shall consider the UV region where the correction to the anomalous dimension is\nrelatively small. In this region, the effect of the deformation of the conifold is small,\nso we can use the singular conifold geometry.\nFirst we want to summarize the singular conifold metric for the sake of completeness and clarification of our notation. The ten dimensional metric which describes\nthe singular AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 geometry has the form\nds2 = H \u22121/2 (r)\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + H 1/2 (r)(dr 2 + r 2 ds2T 1,1 ),\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere ds2T 1,1 is the metric on the T 1,1 = S 3 \u00d7 S 2 base of the conifold which is\nparameterized by five angles \u03b81 , \u03b82 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], \u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], and \u03c8 \u2208 [0, 4\u03c0]. A\ncompact notation of the metric and the cycles in T 1,1 is obtained by introducing the\n1-forms [33, 3],\n\u221a1 (e1\n2\n1\n3\n\ng1 =\ng3 =\n\n\u221a1 (e\n2\n\n\u2212 e3 ) ,\n\n+e ),\n\n\u221a1 (e2\n2\n2\n4\n\ng2 =\n\ng4 =\n\n\u221a1 (e\n2\n\n\u2212 e4 ),\n\n+e ),\n\ng 5 = e5 ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere\ne1 = \u2212 sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\n\ne2 = d\u03b81 ,\n\ne4 = sin \u03c8 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 + cos \u03c8d\u03b82 ,\n\ne3 = cos \u03c8 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 \u2212 sin \u03c8d\u03b82 ,\n\ne5 = d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe metric on T 1,1 can then be written as\n4\n\nds2T 1,1\n\n1X i 2 1 5 2\n=\n(g ) + (g )\n6 i=1\n9\n1\n=\n9\n\nd\u03c8 +\n\n2\nX\n\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i\n\ni=1\n\n!2\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u0001\n1X\nd\u03b8i2 + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i\n6 i=1\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe S 2 and S 3 cycles of T 1,1 are represented by the following 2- and 3-forms\n1\n\u03c92 = (g 1 \u2227 g 2 + g 3 \u2227 g 4) ,\n2\n\n1\n\u03c93 = g 5 \u2227 (g 1 \u2227 g 2 + g 3 \u2227 g 4 )\n2\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n(5.5)\n\n\fwhich give\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u03c93 = 8\u03c0 ,\n\nS3\n\nZ\n\n\u03c92 = 4\u03c0.\n\nOur notation is such that the inner product of a p-form \u03c9p =\n* * * \u2227 dxMp satisfies\n\u03c9p \u2227 \u22c6\u03c9p =\n\n(5.6)\n\nS2\n1\n(\u03c9p )M1 ...Mp dxM1\np!\n\n1\n1\n(\u03c9p )M1 ...Mp (\u03c9p )M1 ...Mp vol = \u03c9p2 vol.\np!\np!\n\n\u2227\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere vol stands for the ten dimensional volume element which we write as\n\u221a\nr 5 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 H 0\nvol =\ndx \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 \u2227 dr \u2227 d\u03c8 \u2227 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62\n108\n\u221a\nr5 H 0\ndx \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 \u2227 dr \u2227 g 1 \u2227 g 2 \u2227 g 3 \u2227 g 4 \u2227 g 5.\n(5.8)\n=\n108\nMoreover, the above ten dimensional metric gives the Ricci scalar\nR=\u2212\n\n1 \u0010 \u2032\u2032 5 \u2032 \u0011\nH + H .\n2H 3/2\nr\n\n(5.9)\n\nAs we have seen, the corrections lead to a running of the dilaton with the slope\nin the logarithmic running of e\u2212\u03a6 changing across each cascade step. Moreover, the\nH3 flux has a step-wise jump at each cascade step. In this section we want to find\nthe resulting step-wise corrections to the warp factor.\nFirst let us recall the Klebanov-Tseytlin (KT) solution [20] on the singular conifold. The N regular D3-branes induce flux through T 1,1 , the M fractional D3-branes\ninduce flux through S 3 , the backreaction H3 flux is through dr \u2227 \u03c92 .

One then puts (5.9) and (5.13) in (4.13), with \u03a6 set to zero, and solves for\nH(r) to obtain the KT solution [20],\n27\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 2 gs\nH0 (r) =\n4r 4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n3gs M 2\nN+\n[ln(r/r0 ) + 1/4] ,\n2\u03c0\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n(5.14)\n\n\fwhere, with the volume of T 1,1 given by v\u03c0 3 = 16\u03c0 3 /27,\nr04 = 4\u03c0\u03b1\u20322 gs N/v =\n\n27\u03c0\u03b1\u20322 gs N\n4\n\nand the locations of duality transitions in the KS throat are given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2l\u03c0\n.\nrl = r0 exp \u2212\n3gs M\n\n(5.15)\n\n(5.16)\n\nNote that the constant piece N in (5.14) is determined by the boundary condition.\nWe see that the effective D3-brane charge is given by\nNeff = N +\n\n3gs M 2\nln(r/r0 )\n2\u03c0\n\n(5.17)\n\nso that at r = rl , Neff = N \u2212 lM. The term with 1/4 factor is introduced to ensure\nthat the warp factor H0 (r) is monotonic for r0 \u2265 r \u2265 rK .\nNow let us proceed with the corrections included. First we want to find the\nlocations rl where the duality transformations take place. The relation between rl\nand rl\u22121 is obtained remembering that b\u03042 (rl ) \u2212 b\u03042 (rl\u22121 ) = \u22122 and b\u03042 (rl ) = \u2212(2l \u2212 1)\nwhich with (4.30) or (4.31) gives the recursion relation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011\n1\u0010\nrl\n=\u2212\n(2l \u2212 1)e\u2212\u03a6(rl ) \u2212 (2l \u2212 3)e\u2212\u03a6(rl\u22121 )\nln\nrl\u22121\nDl\n2\n2\ne\u2212\u03a6(rl\u22121 ) = \u2212\n=\u2212\ne\u2212\u03a6(rl\u22121 ) ,\n(5.18)\nDl \u2212 (2l \u2212 1)Sl\nDl + Sl b\u03042 (rl )\nwhich gives\nl\nh X\nrl = r0 exp \u2212\nk=1\n\ni\n2\n\u2212\u03a6(rk\u22121 )\ne\nDk \u2212 (2k \u2212 1)Sk\n\n(5.19)\n\nor combining with (4.29),\n\nl\nh \u0010X\nrl = r0 exp \u2212\nk1\n\n\u0010\n1+\n\n2\nDk1 \u2212 (2k1 \u2212 1)Sk1\n=1\n\nkX\n1 \u22121\nk2\n\nkX\n2 \u22121\n\u0010\n2Sk2\n2Sk3\n1+\nDk2 \u2212 (2k2 \u2212 1)Sk2\nDk3 \u2212 (2k3 \u2212 1)Sk3\n=1\nk =1\n3\n\nkX\n3 \u22121\n\u0010\n1+\nk4\n\n2Sk4\nDk4 \u2212 (2k4 \u2212 1)Sk4\n=1\n\nFor instance,\nh\nr1 = r0 exp \u2212\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n*** 1+\n\n2S1 \u0011\u0011\u0011\u0011\u0011\u0011 \u2212\u03a6(r0 ) i\n.

We will\ndo that without a need for computing the explicit expressions for the fluxes, since it\nis actually H 3/2 H32 which will come in the equation of motion of the warp factor after\ncombining (4.8) and (4.13). If one needs to determine the fluxes explicitly, then it\nwould be necessary to decompose the fluxes with appropriate ansatz and solve all the\nsupergravity equations of motion consistently. First let us rewrite (4.8) and (4.13)\nwith C0 = 0, the metric given by (5.1) and the corresponding Ricci scalar (5.9),\nh \u0010\nr2 = r0 exp \u2212\n\nand\n\n\u0001\n5\n1 \u03a6 2 \u0304\n(\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + \u03a6\u2032 )H =\ne gs f \u2212 e\u2212\u03a6 h\u0304 ,\nr\n12\n\n\u0001\n1 \u03a6 2 \u0304\n5\ne gs f + e\u2212\u03a6 h\u0304 ,\n\u2212(H \u2032\u2032 + H \u2032 ) = \u03a6\u20322 H +\nr\n12\nwhere we have defined\nf \u0304 \u2261 H 3/2 F32 ,\n\nh\u0304 \u2261 H 3/2 H32 .\n\n(5.23)\n\n(5.24)\n\n(5.25)\n\nWhenever the dilaton runs, as in the case here, both sides of (5.23) are nonzero\nand consequently \u22c6F3 6= e\u2212\u03a6 H3 /gs and the 3-form combination F3 \u2212 ie\u2212\u03a6 H3 /gs is\nnot imaginary self dual. We have already found h\u0304 from the gauge/gravity duality\nmapping, with (4.33) and (5.25),\nh\u0304 =\n\n\u00112\n27\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u20322 \u0010\nD\n+\nS\nb\u0304\n(r)\ne2\u03a6 .\nl\nl 2\nr6\n\n(5.26)\n\nNow we can use (5.23) to find e\u03a6 gs2f \u0304 and substitute it into (5.24) to find the equation\nof motion for the warp factor in terms of known quantities,\n5\n5\n1\nH \u2032\u2032 + H \u2032 + (\u03a6\u20322 + \u03a6\u2032\u2032 + \u03a6\u2032 )H = \u2212 e\u2212\u03a6 h\u0304.\nr\nr\n6\n\n(5.27)\n\nThe form of the equation of motion given by (5.27) holds for any H3 flux so far as all\nits components are in the internal (extra) space. Because F3 drops out in combining\n(5.23) and (5.24), it could have any components (and the f \u0304 terms could have additional factors of H) so far as it is consistent with H3 having internal components and\nthe fluxes satisfy the Bianchi identity and the supergravity equations. The equation\nof motion (5.27) remains valid, even if we turn on F1 , since it drops out in the same\nway as F3 too. Moreover, it is always possible to express the fluxes with all components in the internal space using the democratic formulation [34]. We know from the\nrunning of the dilaton (4.25) that\n\u03a6\u2032 =\n\nSl \u03a6\ne ,\nr\n\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 =\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nSl2 2\u03a6 Sl \u03a6\ne \u2212 2e\nr2\nr\n\n(5.28)\n\n\fand (5.27) can be rewritten as\n2\n1\n5\nH \u2032\u2032 + H \u2032 + 2 (Sl2 e2\u03a6 + 2Sl e\u03a6 )H = \u2212 e\u2212\u03a6 h\u0304.\nr\nr\n6\n\n(5.29)\n\nThus we have obtained the equation of motion for the warp factor which contains\nonly variables we have determined in the gauge/gravity duality mapping.\nLet us write h\u0304 and the warp factor H as\nh\u0304 = h\u03040 + \u03b4 h\u0304,\n\nH = H0 + \u03b4H,\n\n(5.30)\n\nwhere h\u03040 = 243\u03b1\u20322gs2 M 2 /r 6 and H0 given by (5.14) are the corresponding values in\nthe absence of corrections to the anomalous dimension.

The reasons for the\n1/K 3 order in the height of the step are the following. First, the correction in H(r)\nitself comes at order 1/K. Second, the step comes in the difference between H(1, r)\nand H(2, r) across a duality transition which gives an additional factor \u221d gs M/K\neffectively coming from corrections to the location of the step. These two together\ngive a factor \u221d (1/K)(gs M/K) = gs N/K 3 . We also note that the warp factor steps\nup as the theory flows across r = r1 down toward the bottom of the throat.

An illustration of the warp factor is shown in Figures\n2 and 3. The steps are not visible in Figure 2, since we have taken large K. A\nmagnified plot of the first step in the warp factor is shown for a relatively small value\nof K in Figure 3.\nNow we want to discuss how we can isolate and focus on some number of steps\nand write down the warp factor for a flow including only s number of steps starting\nfrom some location of duality transition at r = rl0 ; i.e, in the range rl0 \u22121 < r < rl0 +s .\nSince we may be in a region far away from the edge of the throat, we use the expansion\nparameter 1/Keff = M/Neff = 1/(K \u2212 (l \u2212 1)), where Neff = N \u2212 (l \u2212 1)M is the\neffective number of D3-brane charge for the flow between rl\u22121 and rl .

D3-brane world volume effective action\nIn this section we like to discuss the D3-brane world volume effective action in the\nwarped geometry. In particular, we like to see how the steps in the warp factor\nfrom the Seiberg duality cascade show up here. The presence of steps is actually\nvery generic as a correction to the approximate geometry for a warped throat. The\naction here may be used to study how brane inflation can be implemented such that\nthe steps may give possible stringy signatures in the cosmic microwave background\nradiation in the KKLMMT inflationary scenario. To be concrete, we shall present\nour discussion within the context of the KS throat discussed above.\nIn the KKLMMT scenario, inflation takes place when a D3-brane moves in the\nthroat. The inflaton is the location of the D3-brane from the bottom of the throat.\nThe D3-potential gets contributions from a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) term and a\nChern-Simons term in the action, as well as possible terms due to a presence of D3brane sitting at the bottom of the warped deformed throat. The DBI term contains\ne\u2212\u03a6 while the Chern-Simons term does not. When the dilaton is constant, as in the\nKS solution, the two terms cancel out and the D3-potential vanishes in the absence\nof a D3-brane. Consequently, one needs other sources such as D3-brane to attract\nthe D3-brane. Here we can have a dilaton driven inflation, since the dilaton runs\nand the D3-potential is dynamically nonzero.\nPresumably, we are interested in inflation that takes place when r < r0 , where\nr0 is the location of the edge of the throat. Thus, given r0 , we can determine all the\nother duality transition locations rl and the bottom of the throat is at rA \u2248 rK . In\nthe large K limit and for small l, the corrections may be very small.\nIncluding the expansion of the universe, the 10-dimensional metric takes the\nform:\nds2 = H \u22121/2 (r)(\u2212dt2 + a(t)2 dx2 ) + H 1/2 (r)(dr 2 + r 2 ds2T 1,1 )\n\n(6.1)\n\nHere the cosmic scale factor a(t) is that of an expanding homogeneous isotropic\nuniverse spanned by the 3-dimensions x, and r is the coordinate for the flow in the\nthroat. The metric ds2T 1,1 is for base of the conifold. Warped spaces are natural\nin string theory models and are useful for flattening potentials and for generating\na hierarchy of scales with the UV at the top (edge) of the throat and the IR scale\nat the warped bottom (around r \u223c rA ). Crudely, H(r) \u223c (r/R)\u22124 , where R \u226b rA\nis the scale of the throat. The expression for the action includes the dilaton \u03a6, the\nmetric GM N , the anti-symmetric tensor BM N and the gauge field FM N . The ChernSimons term contains couplings between the brane and R-R fields (p-forms) Cp , with\np even for type IIB theory. We use variable \u03be and indices {a, b} for coordinates and\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fquantities on the brane and we have\nZ\np\nSD3 = \u2212T3 d4 \u03bee\u2212\u03a6 det|Gab + Bab + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032Fab |\n#\nZ \"X\n4\nh\ni\n\u2032\n\u00b1\u03bc3\nCp \u2227 tr e2\u03c0\u03b1 F +B\nM4\n\n(6.2)\n\np=0\n\nwhere T3 = [(2\u03c0)3 gs \u03b1\u20322 ]\u22121 is the tension of a D3-brane. Here gs is the string coupling\nand the Regge slope \u03b1\u2032 = m\u22122\ns sets the string scale, where ms is the string mass scale.\nThe quantities inside the determinant have been pulled back onto the brane and the\n\u00b1 is for a brane/anti-brane. In particular, note that the pulled back metric (Gab )\nwill contain the warp factor. In the second term \u03bc3 = gs T3 is the brane charge. The\nintegration is over the D3-brane world volume, and contributions should, of course,\nhave the correct dimension. In the simplest cases, many of the fields appearing in\n(6.2) are trivially zero. However, for more interesting solutions we will need to solve\nthe supergravity equations to find each of the fields.\nWe now consider the simple case with vanishing pullbacks Bab and Fab , and only\nC4 non-zero (D3-branes are charged under the 4-form RR field C4 ). The D3-brane\nalone in this background is supersymmetric. In addition, the supergravity equations\nrequire that components of C4 on the brane be 1/H(r)gs. We have aligned the\nbrane coordinates with the usual space-time coordinates so that the only non-zero\nderivatives in the pullback are those with respect to time, and we assume that only\nthe radial motion of the brane is important. Then (6.2) simplifies to\nZ\n\u0011\na3 (t)T3 \u0010 \u2212\u03a6 p\nSD3 = d4 x\n\u2212e\n1 \u2212 H(r)\u1e59 2 + 1 .\n(6.3)\nH(r)\nFor slow motion along r, this reduces to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n2\n1\n\u2212\u03a6\n4\n3\n\u2212\u03a6 \u1e59\n\u2212\n(e \u2212 1) .\nSD3 \u2248 d xa (t)T3 e\n2\nH(r)\n\n(6.4)\n\nWe see that the D3 potential VD3 (r) = (e\u2212\u03a6(r) \u22121)/H(r) vanishes for constant dilaton\n\u03a6 = 0.\nThe inflaton \u03c6 is related to the position of a space-time filling D3-brane moving\nin such a throat. Specifically,\np\n(6.5)\n\u03c6 = T3 r\nso we have the following inflaton action in the slow-roll regime,\n#\n\"\nZ\n2\nT\n\u03c6\u0307\n3\n(e\u2212\u03a6(\u03c6) \u2212 1) ,\nSD3 \u2248 dx4 a3 (t) e\u2212\u03a6(\u03c6) \u2212\n2\nH(\u03c6)\nwhere \u03a6(r) \u2192 \u03a6(\u03c6) and H(r) \u2192 H(\u03c6).\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n(6.6)\n\n\fThe kinetic term in this action has the form considered in [35]. The potential is\nsimilar to that considered in [36]. Effects of features in the inflaton potential were\nalso studied in [37]. Note that the D3-potential term in (6.6) vanishes for \u03a6 = 0.\nOne may consider two possibilities: (1) \u03a6 = 0 as the asymptotic value of the dilaton\nat large r. That is, the D3-brane is mobile in the bulk away from the throat; (2)\n\u03a6 = 0 at the bottom of the throat, so the D3-brane is BPS there.\nHere we take \u03a6 = 0 at r = r0 or 1 + S1 c1 = 0. We can always add an inflaton\nmass term if necessary. Using (4.29),\nd \u2212\u03a6\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u1e59\ne = \u2212Sl = \u2212Sl .\ndt\nr\n\u03c6\n\n(6.7)\n\nNow we connect the steps in the D3-brane potential with an interpolating tanh\nfunction. First let us write the D3-brane potential for the flow between rl\u22121 to rl as\nVD3 (l, r) = T3\n\ne\u2212\u03a6(l,r) \u2212 1\n,\nH(l, r)\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhere we use H(l, r) given by (5.40),\nH(l, r) =\n\n27\u03c0\u03b1\u20322 h\n3gs2 M 2\nr\n1\ng\nN\n+\n[ln(\n)\n+\n]\ns\n4r 4\n2\u03c0\nr0\n4\n\u0010 3g 2 M 2\nr\nrl\u22121\n3gs M\n1 3gs M\ns\n[ln( ) + ][\nln(\n) + (2l \u2212 3) \u2212\n]\n\u2212\n2\u03c0\nrls\n4\n\u03c0\nr0\n8\u03c0\n9g 3 M 3\nr\nr\n1\u00111i\n\u2212 s 2 [ln( ) + 2(ln( ))2 + ]\n,\n4\u03c0\nr0\nr0\n4 K\n\n(6.9)\n\nand \u03a6 given by (4.28, 4.29),\n\u2212\u03a6(l,r)\n\ne\n\n= 1 + S1 c 1 \u2212\n\nl\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\nSk ln(rk /rk\u22121 ) \u2212 Sl ln(r/rl\u22121 ).\n\n(6.10)\n\nWe then connect the steps with interpolating tanh function and write the D3-brane\npotential given by (6.8) as\nVD3 (r) \u2248 VD3 (1, r) +\n\nK\u22121\nX\nl=1\n\n\u0011\u0010\nh r \u2212 r i\u0011\n1\u0010\nl\nVD3 (l + 1, r) \u2212 VD3 (l, r) 1 + tanh\n, (6.11)\n2\nrl d\n\nwhere again K \u2261 N/M. We expect the steps to be smoothed out by the scale at the\nSeiberg duality transition, namely, \u039bl \u223c rl , so we introduce the width dl = rl d, where\nthe parameter d measures the sharpness of the steps, with smaller d corresponding\nto sharper steps. As the theory flows to smaller AdS5 radius toward the bottom of\nthe throat, rl decreases, so the steps are becoming sharper.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\f10-1 H\u0391'2 T-1\n3 L VD3 HrL\n8\n6\n4\n2\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nr\n\nFigure 4: D3-brane potential plotted for parameters gs = 0.3, K = 100, M = 20,\nd = 0.0001 and r0 = 100.\n\nThe height of the first step in the potential follows from (5.42) and (6.8),\n\u0010 H(2, r ) \u2212 H(1, r ) \u0011\n1\n1\n(e\u2212\u03a6(r1 ) \u2212 1)\nH(1, r1)H(2, r1)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3gs M\n1\n4T3 r14\n\u2243\n\u20322\n27\u03c0\u03b1 gs N\n8\u03c0\nK4\n\nVD3 (1, r1 ) \u2212 VD3 (2, r1 ) = T3\n\n(6.12)\n\nand the absolute magnitude of the step is of leading order 1/K 4 .

The potential we have here\nsteps down as the theory flows across r = rl down toward the bottom of the throat.\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fSince the step sizes are O(1/K 4 ) while the dilaton running starts at O(1/K), it\nis useful to consider the potential without the steps.

It is also reasonable to\nexpect that the D3-brane is BPS at the bottom of the throat, \u03c6 = \u03c6A . In this case,\n\u03a6A = \u03a6(\u03c6A ) = 0 and c would be determined in terms of the other parameters. Here\nwe have set \u03a6 = 0 at the edge of the throat, r = r0 .\nIf the inflaton is moving relativistically, the NS-NS term in VD3 (\u03c6) becomes part\nof the DBI kinetic action and so VD3 (\u03c6) \u2192 \u2212T3 /H. This interesting case should be\nstudied carefully.\nAs the D3-brane moves across a step, it would generate oscillations in the angular\npower spectrum of density perturbations. Moreover, for K big enough such that we\ncould see two or three steps, it might be possible to correlate the steps and make\nsome definitive predictions. In comparing with [36], we see that the warp factor and\nso VD3 (\u03c6) can be quite sensitive to the details of the throat geometry. This fact\nshould be taken into account in any model comparison to cosmological data.\nIn the D3-D3-brane inflationary scenario, there is a D3-brane sitting at the\nbottom of the throat at \u03c6 = \u03c6A . So we should introduce VDD\u0304 (r); this is independent\nof \u03a6, so it is not modified from the KS case.\nV (\u03c6) = VDD\u0304 (\u03c6) + VD3 (\u03c6),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n27 V0\n,\nVDD\u0304 (\u03c6) = V0 1 \u2212\n64\u03c0 2 \u03c64\nV0 = 2T3 /H(\u03c6K ) = 8T3 ue\u22124u ,\n\n(6.16)\n\nwhere the constant term V0 is the effective vacuum energy. Additional terms coming\nfrom the K\u00e4hler potential may be present. Such terms may also have strong dependence on the dilaton. Back-reaction may ameliorate the size and/or the steepness of\nthe potential. This requires a more careful analysis.\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\f7. The warped deformed/resolved conifold\nThe deformation of the conifold via gaugino condensation in the gauge theory in\nthe KS throat is related to a geometric transition in the gravity theory where the\nS 2 \u2282 T 1,1 cycle shrinks to zero size, the M number of D5 branes wrapping S 2\ndisappear and are replaced by flux through S 3 \u2282 T 1,1 . Thus the tip of the deformed\nconifold is S 3 . The metric which describes the deformed conifold thus involves an\ninterpolation between T 1,1 at large r and S 3 at the tip of the conifold. However, it\nwas later discussed that a flow to a baryonic branch with a quantum deformed moduli\nspace of SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M), in the case where N is an integral multiple of M, might\nbe the preferred route of the flow [22, 24]. In the MN case, N = 1 supersymmetric\ngauge theory was obtained by wrapping NS5-branes on S 2 . A metric and flux ansatz\nwhich could give an interpolating solution between KS and MN was put forward in\n[31]. A leading order perturbative expansion around the KS solution was found in\n[22]. Later, SU(3) structures were used to find a one parameter set of solutions which\nflow in a direction from KS to MN [24]. We used Einstein frame in previous sections.\nIn this and the next section, we will be using the string frame and also absorb gs in\ne\u03a6 . The metrics in the two frames are related by GM N (string) = e\u03a6/2 GM N (Einstein).\n7.1 SU(3) structures\nIn this section we will briefly review the basic ideas in applying SU(3) structures\nto study supergravity backgrounds with torsions. The study of supersymmetry conditions for supergravity backgrounds with torsion was initiated by Strominger [39].\nSee [40, 41, 42, 24] for details on applying group structures to supergravity.\nConsider a compactification of type IIB strings on R(1,3) \u00d7 Y , where Y is a compact six dimensional manifold. The Clifford algebra in ten dimensions is described\nby ten 32 \u00d7 32 gamma matrices. Let us denote these gamma matrices by \u0393M , where\nthe uppercase letters M, N, * * * run over 0, 1, * * * , 9. The gamma matrices satisfy\n{\u0393M , \u0393N } = 2GM N , where GM N is the metric. The generators of the Lorentz group\nSpin(1, 9) on R(1,3) \u00d7 Y can be constructed as commutators of the gamma matrices.\nThe spinor representation in 10-d is given by \u0393(10) = \u03930 \u03931 * * * \u03939 . The Lorentz algebra decomposes to Spin(1, 3) \u00d7 Spin(6) on R(1,3) \u00d7 Y . We can write \u0393(10) = \u0393(4) \u0393(6) ,\nwhere \u0393(4) = \u2212i\u03930 * * * \u03933 and \u0393(6) = i\u03934 * * * \u03939 denote the spinor representations on\nR(1,3) and on Y respectively. There are two spinors of the same chirality in IIB which\n1\n1\n2\n2\ndecompose under Spin(1, 3) \u00d7 Spin(6) as \u01eb1 = \u03b6+ \u03b7+\n+ \u03b6\u2212 \u03b7\u2212\nand \u01eb2 = \u03b6+ \u03b7+\n+ \u03b6\u2212 \u03b7\u2212\n,\n\u2217\n(1,3)\ni\ni\ni \u2217\nwhere \u03b6+ is the spinor on R\n, \u03b7 are the spinors on Y , \u03b6\u2212 = \u03b6+ , and \u03b7\u2212 = \u03b7+ .\nThe number of supersymmetries in 4-d depends on the structure group on Y . A\ngeneric Y with structure group SO(6) \u223c SU(4) has no globally defined covariantly\nconstant spinor and gives no supersymmetry. The spinor representation of SO(6)\ncorresponds to the fundamental representation of SU(4) which decomposes as 1 \u2295 3\nunder SU(3). Thus there is one globally defined SU(3) singlet spinor on Y . In order\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\fto preserve some supersymmetry, Y needs to have a reduced structure group and\nto preserve N = 1 supersymmetry the structure group on Y has to be reduced at\nleast to SU(3). In that case, if we denote the one SU(3) singlet spinor mentioned\n1,2\nabove by \u03b7+ , the two spinors \u03b7+\nare complex proportional and are related to the\ninvariant spinor in terms of two complex functions \u03b1 and \u03b2 which can be expressed\n2\n1\n= 2i1 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b7+ . If Y is a Calabi-Yau threefold, the\nas \u03b7+\n= 21 (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u03b7+ and \u03b7+\nglobally invariant spinor would also be covariantly constant and depend trivially on\nthe tangent frame bundle on Y and these two spinors give N = 2 supersymmetry in\nfour dimensions.\nHowever, when fluxes are turned on, the geometry backreacts and develops torsion and Y could in general become non-Ricci-flat and non-K\u00e4hler. When the extra\nspace is compactified on a generalized Calabi-Yau with SU(3) structures, the fluxes\nfrom the N regular and M fractional D3-branes give rise to torsions which fall in\nvarious representations of SU(3). In the presence of fluxes, the spinor \u03b7 + is not covariantly constant with respect to the Levi-Civita connection but would be so with a\nconnection which includes torsion. The components of the torsion fall into the SU(3)\nrepresentations (3+ 3\u0304)\u2297(3+ 3\u0304+1) = (8+8)\u2295(6+ 6\u0304)\u2295(3+ 3\u0304)\u2295(3+ 3\u0304)\u2295(1+1). On the\nother hand, there are two SU(3) singlets on Y , one is a fundamental 2-form which\ndescribes the almost complex structure and the other is a globally non-vanishing\nholomorphic 3-form. Unlike the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds, these 2- and 3-forms\nare not closed now and the different components of the torsion come in dJ and d\u03a9. dJ\nhas 20 components and decomposes under SU(3) as (6 + 6\u0304) \u2295(3 + 3\u0304) + (1 + 1), and d\u03a9\ntransforms as a 24 of SU(4) and decomposes under SU(3) as (8+8)\u2295(3+ 3\u0304)+(1+1).\nSimilarly the fluxes can be decomposed into different components in representations\nof SU(3). The different components of the torsion which fall in representations of\nSU(3) need to vanish or get balanced by fluxes of the corresponding forms and representations in order to preserve N = 1 supersymmetry. This gives constraints on\nthe relations among the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, the fluxes and the metric.\nNext we want to see the torsion components in the variations of the fundamental\n2-form and the holomorphic 3-form when Y has SU(3) structures. Suppose we have\nparameterized the metric on Y as\nds26\n\n=\n\n6\nX\n\nG2m ,\n\n(7.1)\n\nm=1\n\nwhere Gm are real differential 1-forms which are not closed here. Lower case indices\nm, n, * * * run over 1 to 6 here. Let us then define\nZ1 = G1 + iG2 ,\n\nZ2 = G3 + iG4 ,\n\nZ3 = G5 + iG6 .\n\n(7.2)\n\nWe can then write the fundamental 2-form J and the holomorphic 3-form \u03a9 as\nJ =\n\n3\ni X\nZi \u2227Z\u0304\u012b ,\n2\ni=\u012b=1\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n(7.3)\n\n\f\u03a9 = Z1 \u2227Z2 \u2227Z3 .\n\n(7.4)\n\nThe i is for holomorphic indices which run over 1 to 3, and the \u012b is for the corresponding anti-holomorphic indices. However, the Zi 's are not differentials of complex coordinates and we will need to impose constraints in order to make Y a complex manifold. Note that J transforms as (1, 1) and \u03a9 transforms as (3, 0). The complex and\nK\u00e4hler structures on Y are determined by the properties in the variations of J and \u03a9.\nBut it is easy to see that dJ has components with forms (2, 1) \u2295 (1, 2) \u2295 (3, 0) \u2295 (0, 3)\nin the Zi 's. Moreover, d\u03a9 has components with (3, 1) \u2295 (2, 2) forms; it does not\nhave a (4, 0), since a complex 4-form vanishes in three complex dimensions. When\nY has SU(3) structures, the components can further be broken down to representations of SU(3). The (3, 0) \u2295 (0, 3) forms in dJ fall in the singlet representation, the\n(1, 2) \u2295 (2, 1) forms fall in the (6 \u2295 3) \u2295 (6\u0304 \u2295 3\u0304) representations. The (3, 1) form in\nd\u03a9 falls in the 5\u0304 representation and the (2, 2) form falls in the 8 \u2295 1 representations.\nAll in all,\n3\n(1)\n(3)\n(3\u0304)\n(6)\n(6\u0304)\ndJ = \u2212 Im(W1 \u03a9\u0304) + (W4 + W4 ) \u2227 J + (W3 + W3 ),\n2\n(1)\n\n(8)\n\n(3\u0304)\n\nd\u03a9 = W1 J 2 + W2 \u2227 J + W5 \u2227 \u03a9,\n\n(7.5)\n(7.6)\n\nwhere the W 's denote components of the torsion. If Y is a Calabi-Yau manifold, then\nboth J and \u03a9 are closed, dJ = 0 and d\u03a9 = 0, and all torsion components vanish.\nThus nonvanishing components of the torsion measure the departure of the manifold\nfrom being Calabi-Yau. The fluxes can also be decomposed as\n3\n(1)\n(3)\n(3\u0304)\n(6)\n(6\u0304)\nH3 = \u2212 Im(H3 \u03a9\u0304) + (H3 + H3 ) \u2227 J + (H3 + H3 ),\n2\n\n(7.7)\n\n3\n(1)\n(3)\n(3\u0304)\n(6)\n(6\u0304)\n(7.8)\nF3 = \u2212 Im(F3 \u03a9\u0304) + (F3 + F3 ) \u2227 J + (F3 + H3 ).\n2\nIf Y is to be a complex manifold, the (3, 0) and (0, 3) components of dJ and the (2, 2)\n(1)\n(8)\ncomponents in d\u03a9 must vanish which amount to demanding W1 = 0 and W2 = 0.\n7.2 Equations of motion in the 6 \u2295 6\u0304 sector\nThe constraint on the relation between the fluxes and the torsions were found in [24].\nIt will be enough for our purpose here to focus only on the equations of motion in the\n6 \u2295 6\u0304 sector. In particular the equations of motion for flux and torsion components\nin the 6 \u2295 6\u0304 representations are the following three complex equations, of which only\ntwo are independent,\n(6)\n(6)\n(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )W3 = 2\u03b1\u03b2e\u03a6 F3 ,\n(7.9)\n(6)\n\n(\u03b12 + \u03b2 2 )W3\n(6)\n\n(6)\n\n= \u22122\u03b1\u03b2 \u22c66 H3 ,\n\n(6)\n\n(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )H3 = (\u03b12 + \u03b2 2 )e\u03a6 \u22c66 F3 .\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n(7.10)\n(7.11)\n\n\fA one parameter of numerical solution for the supersymmetry conditions using\nthe ansatz in [31] was obtained in [24] for the case of \u03b1 real and \u03b2 imaginary, where\nthe varying parameter arises from different possible values of the boundary value\nof dilaton at the very edge (or the very bottom) of the throat and the vacuum\nexpectation value of the axionic scalar moduli field on the quantum deformed moduli\nspace in the baryonic branch. We will see later that the supergravity side containing\nthe corrections to the anomalous mass dimension from the gauge theory side does\nnot fall into this solution. We will also see in the next section the implications of\nthe corrections in terms of SU(3) structures. For now, a simple way to see that the\nsupergravity flow we have here is different is simply to note that the leading order\ncorrection to the running of the dilaton in (4.29), if we just consider the flow in the\nrange r1 \u2264 r \u2264 r0 and define t\u0303 \u2261 ln(r/r0 ), comes at O(t\u0303), which is different from the\nflow found in [22] and [24], where the leading order correction to the running of the\ndilaton comes at O(t\u03032 ). It will be important to construct the full dual supergravity\nbackground and flow corresponding to the supersymmetric gauge theory containing\ncorrections to the anomalous mass dimension.\n\n8. Gravitational source for Seiberg duality transformations\nNow we want to see that the locations where Seiberg duality transformations occur\nhave a geometric obstruction with a jump in the relation between the two complex\n1,2\nproportional spinors \u03b7+\non the six dimensional manifold Y . Conversely, this geometric obstruction provides \"special\" locations on Y which source Seiberg duality\ntransformations. First let us see the magnitudes of the \"charges\" (or the sizes of the\nsteps) which come from the differences in the slopes in e\u2212\u03a6 B2 given by (4.30) and\n(4.32) after and before a Seiberg duality transformation,\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u03c0\u03b1\u2032\ngs M\u03b1\u2032\nDl+1 \u2212 Dl\n= (Cl + Cl\u22122 \u2212 2Cl\u22121 )\n2\n4\n3gs M\u03b1\u2032\n(8.1)\n=\n4(K \u2212 l)(K \u2212 l + 1)(K \u2212 l + 2)\nNote that, in the early stages of the duality cascade, the jump is of order O(1/K 3 ) and\nis quite small for large K. The magnitude increases as l increases, and the maximum\nvalue occurs at the last duality transformation where (CK\u22121 + CK\u22123 \u2212 2CK\u22122 ) = 1/2\nfor N = KM. If we sum up the charges at each step, the magnitude of the total\ncharge from the K \u2212 1 duality transformations is proportional to\nK\u22121\nX\nl=1\n\n\u0011\n3 (K \u2212 1)(K + 2)\n2\n3\u0010\n(Cl + Cl\u22122 \u2212 2Cl\u22121) =\n1\u2212\n.\n=\n4 K(K + 1)\n4\nK(K + 1)\n\n(8.2)\n\nWe see that in the limit K \u2192 \u221e, (8.2) goes to 3/4. Of this the (K \u2212 1)th duality transformation takes 1/2 and the (K \u2212 2)th duality transformation takes 1/8.\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\fPresumably, these charges come from NS5-branes. Most of the charge is located\nin the bottom region of the throat. Moreover, the magnitude of the charges confirms that the theory flows to a baryonic branch rather than to a confining branch\nand the duality cascade ends with the gauge group SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M), in the case\nwhere N is an integral multiple of M. That is because an additional duality transformation would need an infinite amount of charge, since (8.1) diverges for l = K.\nThis implies either that the perturbative expansion of the anomalous dimension in\npowers of M 2 /N(N + M) is invalid here, or that the duality cascade stops at the\nbaryonic branch. This latter case also agrees with the discussion and expectation\nin [22] and [24] of a flow along a baryonic branch. Recall that Seiberg duality in\nN = 1 supersymmetric SU(Nc ) gauge theory with Nf flavors takes place in the\nso-called conformal window 3Nc > Nf > 3Nc /2 and in the free magnetic phase\n3Nc /2 \u2265 Nf > Nc + 1. To satisfy the last condition, K > 2. So we expect the last\ntransition to take place at SU(3M) \u00d7 SU(2M) \u2192 SU(M) \u00d7 SU(2M) and not go\nany further. This is consistent with our analysis.\nThe torsion and the flux components in the 6 \u2295 6\u0304 sector for the ansatz given\n(6)\n(6)\nin [31] and used in [24] can be schematically written as W3 = WR + iWI , H3 =\n(6)\nHR + iHI , and F3 = FR + iFI and be split into two sets where the elements\nof a set have components in the same directions: (WR , FI , \u22c66 FR , HR , \u22c66 HI ) and\n(WI , FR , \u22c66 FI , HI , \u22c66 HR ) [43]. In other words, the elements in the first set, WR , FI , * * *\nhave components along some directions such as G1 \u2227G3 \u2227G6 while the elements in the\nsecond set, WI , FR , * * * have components along other directions such as G1 \u2227G3 \u2227G5 .\nIf we let \u03b1 and \u03b2 have arbitrary phase \u03b8 between them and write \u03b2 = tan w2 ei\u03b8 \u03b1,\nthen the equations of motion in the 6 + 6\u0304 sector, (7.9)-(7.11), give\n\u0011\nw\nw\ncos 2\u03b8 WR = \u22122 tan e\u03a6 sin \u03b8 FI ,\n2\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\nw\nw\n1 \u2212 tan2 cos 2\u03b8 WI = 2 tan e\u03a6 sin \u03b8 FR ,\n2\n2\nw\nw\ntan2 sin 2\u03b8 WI = 2 tan e\u03a6 cos \u03b8 FR ,\n2\n2\nw\nw\n\u2212 tan2 sin 2\u03b8 WR = 2 tan e\u03a6 cos \u03b8 FI ,\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nw\nw\n1 \u2212 tan2 cos 2\u03b8 HR = e\u03a6 1 + tan2 cos 2\u03b8 \u22c66 FR ,\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nw\nw\n1 \u2212 tan2 cos 2\u03b8 HI = e\u03a6 1 + tan2 cos 2\u03b8 \u22c66 FI ,\n2\n2\nw\nw\ntan2 sin 2\u03b8 HI = \u2212e\u03a6 tan2 sin 2\u03b8 \u22c66 FI ,\n2\n2\nw\nw\n\u2212 tan2 sin 2\u03b8 HR = e\u03a6 tan2 sin 2\u03b8 \u22c66 FR .\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\n1 \u2212 tan2\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n(8.3)\n(8.4)\n(8.5)\n(8.6)\n(8.7)\n(8.8)\n(8.9)\n(8.10)\n\n\fWe see that the equations of motion are over-constrained and do not have solution\nfor generic values of \u03b8 unless \u03b8 = \u00b1 \u03c02 (or for \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0 with the fluxes and the torsions\nrelabeled or related by S-duality).\nIn order to study the solutions which describe the effects of corrections to the\nanomalous mass dimension on the supergravity side, one needs a more general ansatz\nsuch as a complexification of the components FR , FI , HR and HI above and/or\nturning on F1 flux in such a way that arbitrary phase between the two spinors could\nbe accommodated. That is because the corrections change the imaginary self-duality\ncondition in the 3-form combination F3 \u2212 ie\u2212\u03a6 H3 in the KS solution in such a way\nthat the supergravity flow does not occur at a fixed phase between the two spinors.\nThe change in magnitude of corrections after a Seiberg duality transformation leads\nto a step in the function tan (w/2) ei\u03b8 which relates the two spinors. This results in\na geometric obstruction. These special geometric locations and the charges on them\nprovide a gravitational source for Seiberg duality transformations.\n\n9. Discussions\nThe gauge/gravity duality implies that the nonperturbative dynamics of the gauge\ntheory knows about the string background geometry. Here we have studied the\nimplications of corrections to the anomalous mass dimension in the physical running\nof the couplings in the gauge theory to the dual gravity theory in the KS throat.\nWe find that a more precise anomalous dimension on the gauge theory side reveals\nstructures on the gravity side. The corrections make the dilaton and the potentials\nrun with kinks and the fluxes and the metric have steps and the deviation from KS\ngrows more and more as the duality cascade proceeds and the theory flows down to\nthe bottom of the throat.\nThe magnitudes of the charges at the steps (or the sizes of the steps) are much\nsmaller in the early stages of the cascade than in the last steps. The magnitudes of the\ncharges confirm that the theory flows to a baryonic branch rather than to a confining\nbranch and the duality cascade ends with the gauge group SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M), in\nthe case where N is an integral multiple of M. That is because an additional duality\ntransformation would require an infinite charge or a step with infinite size. This is\nconsistent with what we would expect from the gauge theory side, since if we think\nof the SU(M) in SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) as a weakly gauged flavor symmetry, we have\nSU(2M) with 2M flavors which falls far outside Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality\nwindow. Rather, it has a quantum deformed moduli space [38]. This also agrees with\nthe discussion and expectation in [22] and [24] of a flow along a baryonic branch.\nConversely, a duality cascade ending in the baryonic branch supports our premise\nthat the anomalous dimension changes after every Seiberg duality transformation as\nthe matter content of the theory changes with the SU(2M)\u00d7SU(M) not undergoing\na duality transformation.\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\fThe steps also provide special locations with geometric obstructions which source\nSeiberg duality transformations. The steps we have discussed here are sharp because\na Seiberg duality transformation occurs at a fixed T 1,1 base (or AdS5 radius). The\nsteps in the fluxes and the metric could be smoothed out if the charges at the steps get\nredistributed and a Seiberg duality transition takes place over some range of scales or\nAdS5 radius. Conversely, the sharpness of the steps on the gravity side would provide\na measure for the sharpness of Seiberg duality transitions on the gauge theory side.\nOverall, we expect that the relations (4.14) and (4.15), i.e., the gauge/gravity duality\ndictionary, should be modified by corrections. This is an important problem to be\nstudied further.\nIt is believed that NS5-brane charges are located at the bottom of the KS throat.\nThe NS5-branes wrap an S 2 of the S 3 . In the absence of fluxes, they wrap a shrinking\nS 2 of the S 3 at, say, angular coordinate \u03c8 = 0 and essentially vanish without a trace.\nIf such NS5-brane can tunnel to the other pole of the S 3 ,i.e., \u03c8 = \u03c0, it becomes\nM D3-branes [44]. Since there are K NS5-branes, together there are N = KM\nD3 charges. Our picture suggests that these K NS5-branes are located at different\npositions, one at each r = rl . Furthermore, they are at different locations of the\nS 3 , that is, they wrap different shrinking S 2 s of the S 3 . As a consequence, H3 is in\ngeneral no longer orthogonal to F3 , which is the case with a non-zero R-R 1-form\nflux F1 .\nIn this paper, we work with the ansatz that, for large r, H3 is along the direction\nof dr \u2227\u03c92 . Although we need only the magnitude of F3 (as given by (5.23) and (5.24))\nto find the warp factor, it is important to find the components of F3 (since F3 does\nnot all lie in \u03c93 ) and an explicit solution of the supergravity equations, even if only\nperturbatively in 1/K.\nThe gauge/gravity duality is a powerful tool to probe both the gauge and the\ndual gravity theories from different directions. It seems that the best way to test/use\ngauge/gravity duality is an attempt to find the gravity dual to QCD. However, our\ntheoretical control is best when we consider super Yang-Mills theories. Unfortunately,\nlattice gauge theory for super Yang-Mills theories is too rudimentary to be useful at\nthe moment. Since Seiberg duality and gauge/gravity duality are strongly believed\nbut not proven, it is quite amazing and useful that the whole notion of Seiberg duality\nand gauge/gravity dualities may be tested in cosmology. If our universe indeed resides\nat a bottom of such a warped deformed throat, the cosmological implication of this\nstep-wise (or cascading) behavior of the metric on the brane inflationary scenario\nand the cosmic microwave background radiation can be very interesting.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Xingang Chen, Igor Klebanov, Oleg Lunin, Sarah Shandera and Jiajun Xu\nfor discussions.
