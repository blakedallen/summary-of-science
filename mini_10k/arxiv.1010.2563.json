Three pairs: (1, 3), (2, 3), and (2, 4) are inverted in this permutation. The inversion number, defined as the total number of pairs that are out of sort,\nprovides a natural measure for how \"scrambled\" a list\nof elements is. This basic combinatorial quantity [1\u20134] is\nhelpful in many contexts. In computer science, the inversion number plays an important role in sorting and ranking algorithms [5]. Common on the web (\"customers who\nlike . . . may also like . . .\"), recommendations for books,\nsongs, and movies use inversions to quantify how close\nthe preferences of two customers are [6].\nThe number of inversions can also be used to measure\nhow the order of a group of particles in one dimension\nchanges with time. Figure 1 illustrates a space-time diagram of four diffusing particles. The number of inversions\nchanges whenever two trajectories cross. Depending on\nthe initial order of the two respective particles, a crossing\nmay either introduce a new inversion or undo an existing\none. Consequently, the inversion number either increases\nor decreases by one. Therefore, the inversion number\nequals the difference between the number of crossings of\nthe first kind and the number of crossings of the second\nkind.\nMixing dynamics has been extensively studied in the\ncontext of fluids [7, 8] and granular materials [9], but\nmuch less attention has been given to mixing in the context of diffusion [10, 11]. In this study, we consider an\nensemble of N diffusing particles in one-dimension, a system that is widely used to model the transport of colloidal\nand biological particles in narrow channels [12, 13]. We\nuse the inversion number to measure the degree to which\nparticles mix. Clearly, a persistent small inversion number indicates a poorly mixed system, while a large inversion number implies that the opposite is true.\nWe first study how the distribution of the inversion\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\nt\n+\n\u2212\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: Space-time diagram of a four-particle system. The\ncircled +s and \u2212s indicate whether the inversion number increases or decreases when two trajectories cross. Four out of\nthe five crossings increase the inversion number, and accordingly, the inversion number increases from m = 0 to m = 3.\n\nnumber evolves with time. We find that there is a\ntransient regime in which the average inversion number as well as the standard deviation in this quantity\nboth grow as the square-root of time. The distribution of the inversion number is stationary beyond this\ntransient regime. When the number of particles is sufficiently large, the probability distribution function is always Gaussian, whether in the transient regime or in the\nsteady-state.\nOur main focus is first-passage properties [14] of the\ninversion number. We ask: what is Sm (t), the probability that the inversion number remains smaller than m up\nto time t. For small values of m, the survival probability Sm measures the likelihood that the particles remain\npoorly mixed throughout the evolution. Generally, the\nprobabilities Sm decay as a power law at large times,\nSm \u223c t\u2212\u03b2m . In general, there is a broad spectrum of\n\n\f2\nN (N \u2212 1)/2 distinct exponents, {\u03b21 , \u03b22 , * * * , \u03b2N (N \u22121)/2 },\nthat governs the asymptotic decay of the survival probabilities.\nWe heavily use first-passage kinetics of a single particle that diffuses inside a circular cone [15\u201317] to understand the asymptotic behavior of Sm . We first utilize\ntwo-dimensional cones to obtain the first-passage exponents for a three-particle system exactly. Furthermore,\nwe employ circular cones in N \u2212 1 dimensions and find\ngood approximate values for the first-passage exponents.\nThe cone approximation correctly predicts that when\nthe number of particles is large, the exponents become a\nuniversal function, \u03b2m (N ) \u2192 \u03b2(z), of the scaling variable\nz = (m \u2212 hmi)/\u03c3. Here, hmi and \u03c3 are the average\nand standard deviation of the distribution of inversion\nnumber, at the steady-state. Interestingly, our numerical\nsimulations show that the cone approximation yields the\nexact scaling function \u03b2(z) as a root of a transcendental\nequation involving the parabolic cylinder function.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section\nII, we introduce our basic system and define the inversion\nnumber. Stationary and transient properties of the distribution of the inversion number are discussed in sections\nIII and IV, respectively. In section V, we use the cone\napproximation to understand first-passage properties of\nthe inversion number. Scaling and extremal properties\nof the first-passage exponents are the focus of section VI.\nWe conclude in section VII.\n\nII.\n\nTHE INVERSION NUMBER\n\nOur goal is to characterize how the order of an ensemble of diffusing particles changes with time. We conveniently use an ordinary random walk [18\u201320] to model\nthe trajectory of a diffusing particle [21]. Our system includes N identical particles that move on an unbounded\none-dimensional lattice. The particles are completely independent: at each step one particle is selected at random and it moves, with an equal probability, either to\nthe left, x \u2192 x \u2212 1, or to the right, x \u2192 x + 1. After\neach elementary step, time is augmented by the inverse\nnumber of particles, t \u2192 t + 1/N , so that each particle\nmoves once per unit time.\nWe index the particles according to their initial position with the leftmost particle labeled n = 1 and the\nrightmost particle labeled n = N (Figure 1). Let xn (t) be\nthe position of the nth particle at time t. By definition,\nx1 (0) < x2 (0) < * * * < xN \u22121 (0) < xN (0),\n\n(1)\n\nbut the initial order unravels with time. Consider, for\nexample, the four-particle system illustrated in Figure\n1. The particles reach a state where x3 < x2 < x1 < x4\nwith three pairs, (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3) being out of sort\ncompared with time t = 0. In general, a pair of particles\nfor which xi (t) > xj (t) and i < j constitutes an inversion.\n\nFormally, the total number of inversions, m, is given by\nm(t) =\n\nN X\nN\nX\n\ni=1 j=i+1\n\n\u0001\n\u0398 xi (t) \u2212 xj (t) .\n\n(2)\n\nHere, \u0398(x) is the Heaviside step function: \u0398(x) = 1 for\nx > 0 and \u0398(x) \u0001= 0 for x \u2264 0. The total number of\npairs is M = N2 , and hence, the variable m is within\nthe bounds 0 \u2264 m \u2264 M with\nM=\n\nN (N \u2212 1)\n.\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe inversion number is minimal, m = 0, when the order\nis exactly the same as in the initial configuration, and it\nis maximal, m = M , when the order is the mirror image\nof the initial state.\nThe inversion number changes whenever two trajectories cross (Figure 1). A crossing either adds a new\ninversion or removes an existing one. Thus, we may assign a positive or a negative \"charge\" to each crossing as\nillustrated in Figure 1. The inversion number, m(t), is\nsimply the sum of all of the charges up to time t.\nIII.\n\nTHE MAHONIAN DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe first discuss basic statistical characteristics of the\ninversion number including the average, the variance, and\nmore generally, the probability distribution function. At\nlarge\ntime t, each random walk explores a region of size\n\u221a\nt, and the probability of finding the particle at any lattice site inside this region is effectively uniform. This\nsimple fact already implies that memory of the initial\nposition fades with time. We thus expect that after sufficient time elapses, there is no memory of the initial order,\nand the order of the particles is completely random.\nTo understand statistics of the inversion number for\nrandomly ordered particles we consider the set of all N !\npermutations of the N elements {1, 2, . . . , N }. In the\nrandom state, each permutation of these elements occurs\nwith probability 1/N !. The probability Pm (N ) that the\ninversion number equals m for a random permutation is\nwell known as the Mahonian distribution in probability\ntheory [1, 2, 5]. We highlight key features of this probability distribution as it plays a central role in our study.\nLet Qm (N ) = N !Pm (N ) be the number of permutations of N elements with exactly m inversions. For example, when N = 3, one permutation (123) is free of inversions, there are two permutations with one inversion (213,\n132), two permutations with two inversions (312, 231),\nand a single permutation with three inversions (321).\nHence, Q0 (3) = Q3 (3) = 1 while Q1 (3) = Q2 (3) = 2. We\nlist the distribution of the inversion number for N \u2264 4,\n\uf8f1\n(1)\nN = 1,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2(1, 1)\n1\nN = 2,\n(P0 , P1 , . . . , PM ) =\n\u00d7\nN! \uf8f4\n(1,\n2,\n2,\n1)\nN\n= 3,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(1, 3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 1) N = 4.\n\n\f3\nOf course, Pm (N ) is nonzero if and only if 0 \u2264 m \u2264 M .\nSince the mirror image of a configuration with m inversions necessarily has M \u2212 m inversions, the probability\ndistribution satisfies Pm = PM\u2212m . Hence, the distribution P\nis symmetric about m = M/2, and the average\nhmi \u2261 m mPm is simply\nhmi =\n\nN (N \u2212 1)\n.\n4\n\n(4)\n\nTherefore, the average grows quadratically with the total\nnumber of particles when N \u226b 1.\nThe Mahonian distribution satisfies the simple recursion relation\nN \u22121\n1 X\nPm\u2212l (N \u2212 1),\nPm (N ) =\nN\n\n(5)\n\nl=0\n\nwith Pm (1) = \u03b4m,0 . This recursion reflects that every\npermutation of N elements can be generated from a permutation of N \u2212 1 elements by inserting the N th element\nin any of the N possible positions. Depending on where\nthis last element is added, the number of inversions increases by an amount \u2206m = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1.\nLet us now introduce the generating function,\nP(s, N ) =\n\nM\nX\n\nPm (N )sm .\n\n(6)\n\nm=0\n\nFor instance, P(s, 1) = 1, P(s, 2) = (1 + s)/2! and\nP(s, 3) = (1 + s)(1 + s+ s2 )/3!. In general, the generating\nfunction is given by the product [5]\nP(s, N ) =\n\nN\n1 Y\n(1 + s + s2 + * * * + sn\u22121 ),\nN ! n=1\n\n(7)\n\nas also follows from the recursion (5).\nWe can confirm the average (4) by differentiating the\ngenerating function once, P\u2032 (s = 1) = hmi, where\nthe prime represents differentiation with respect s. By\ndifferentiating the generating function twice and using\nP\u2032\u2032 (s = 1) = hm(m \u2212 1)i, we obtain the variance [5],\n\u03c3 2 = hm2 i \u2212 hmi2 ,\nN (N \u2212 1)(2N + 5)\n.\n(8)\n72\nP\nl2 \u22121\nThis expression is obtained from \u03c3 2 = N\nl=1 12 . Therefore, the standard deviation is rather large, \u03c3 \u2243 N 3/2 /6,\nwhen N \u226b 1.\nThe mean (4) and the variance (8) fully specify the\nprobability distribution function for an asymptotically\nlarge number of particles. The Mahonian distribution\nbecomes a function of a single variable, Pm (N ) \u2192 \u03a6(z),\nwith the scaling variable\n\u03c32 =\n\nz=\n\nm \u2212 hmi\n.\n\u03c3\n\n(9)\n\nThe probability distribution function, \u03a6(z), is normal,\nthat is, a Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance\n[2, 22],\n\u0012 2\u0013\nz\n1\n.\n(10)\n\u03a6(z) \u2243 \u221a exp \u2212\n2\n2\u03c0\nTo see that the central limit theorem applies, we convert the generating function into a Fourier transform,\nand then show that the Fourier transform is Gaussian in\nthe large-N limit [23].\nThe variable z is a more transparent measure in the\nfollowing sense. A value of z of order one implies fairly\nrandom order. Indeed, according to the normal distribution (10), the inversion number falls within three standard deviations from the mean, |z| < 3, with probability\n0.997. A large value, |z| \u226b 1, indicates that the particle order strongly resembles the initial configuration (if\nz > 0) or its mirror image (if z < 0).\nIV.\n\nTRANSIENT BEHAVIOR\n\nBy definition, the inversion number is zero initially,\nm(0) = 0. At least partially, the initial order is preserved in the early stages of evolution, and the number\nof inversions must be substantially lower than (4).\nWe consider the natural initial condition where the\nparticles occupy N consecutive lattice sites: xi (0) = i,\nfor all i = 1, 2, . . . , N . Early on, particles \"interact\"\nonly within their local neighborhood. The interaction\n\u221a\nlength, l, grows diffusively with time, l \u223c t. On\nthis length scale, particles are well-mixed, and according\nto (4), the number of inversions per particle is proportional to the number of interacting particles, l. Hence,\nthe average number\n\u221a of inversions grows according to\nhm(t)i \u223c N l \u223c N t. As a consequence,\n(\n\u221a\nconst. \u00d7 N t\n1 \u226a t \u226a N 2,\n(11)\nhm(t)i \u2243\n2\nN /4\nN 2 \u226a t,\nwhen N \u226b 1. The two expressions match at t \u223c N 2 ,\na diffusive time scale that can be viewed as the mixing\ntime. Therefore, there is a transient regime in which\nthe inversion number grows as the square-root of time,\nfollowed by a steady-state, in which the average is given\nby (4).\nWe obtain the variance using a similar heuristic argument. According to (8), the variance per particle is quadratic in the number of interacting particles,\n\u03c3 2 \u223c N l2 . Therefore, \u03c3 2 \u223c N t in the transient regime,\n(\n\u221a\nconst \u00d7 N t\n1 \u226a t \u226a N 2,\n\u03c3(t) \u2243\n(12)\n3/2\nN /6\nN 2 \u226a t.\nAs expected, the transient behavior matches the steadystate behavior (8) at the diffusive time scale t \u223c N 2 .\nLike the average, the standard deviation also grows as\nthe square root of time.\n\n\f4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\nEq.

The results correspond to an average over 102 independent realizations of a system with N = 103 random walks.\nAlso shown for reference is a line with slope 1/2.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, results of numerical simulations\nconfirm the scaling behavior (11). Moreover, the numerically measured average matches the steady-state value\ncorresponding to the Mahonian distribution. We also\nverified that the stationary distribution is Gaussian with\nthe variance (8).\nThe simulations also show that the time-dependent\ndistribution of inversion number, pm (N, t), is Gaussian\nthroughout the transient regime (Figure 3):\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n(m \u2212 hm(t)i)2\npm (N, t) \u2243 p\n. (13)\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3 2 (t)\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2 (t)\n\nThis behavior provides further support for our heuristic\nargument. Indeed, if the particles are well-mixed locally,\nthen the distribution of the number of inversions per particle is Gaussian, and as the sum of N Gaussian variables,\nthe total inversion number must also have a Gaussian distribution.\nWe used two different algorithms to simulate the diffusion process. In the naive algorithm, we randomly select\na particle and move it to a randomly-chosen neighboring\nsite. We increase time by 1/N after each jump. To calculate the inversion number, we use the formula (2), but\nsince this enumeration requires O(N 2 ) operations, this\nsimulation method is inefficient at large N .\nTo overcome this difficulty, we introduced a variant\nwhere each lattice site may be occupied by at most one\nparticle. At each step we pick one particle at random\nand attempt to move it by one site. This move is always\naccepted if the neighboring site is vacant, but otherwise,\nit is accepted with probability 1/2. In the latter case,\nwe merely exchange the identities of the respective particles, and as appropriate, update the inversion number by\neither +1 or \u22121. In our implementation, there are two\narrays: the first lists the particle positions, in order, and\nthe second lists the original position of each particle in\nthe first list. This algorithm has a fixed computational\n\n0\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(m-<m>)/\u03c3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 3: The distribution of the inversion number in the intermediate time regime 1 \u226a t \u226a N 2 .

The distribution is shown at times\nt = 102 (diamonds), t = 103 (squares), and t = 104 (circles).\nAlso shown for reference is the normal distribution (13).\n\ncost per step, and it automatically keeps track of the\ninversion number. We rely on the fact that in one dimension, noninteracting random walks are equivalent to\nrandom walks that interact by exclusion [24\u201327]. Still,\nwe verified that the two algorithms yield essentially the\nsame results. We utilized the naive algorithm to simulate\nsmall systems with N < 10, but otherwise, we used the\nefficient algorithm.\nV.\n\nFIRST-PASSAGE KINETICS\n\nWe have seen that the inversion number, which grows\nquadratically with the number of particles, can be quite\nlarge. Yet, if the mixing is poor and the particle trajectories rarely cross, the inversion number remains small. To\nquantify how common such a scenario is, we study firstpassage kinetics [14, 28]. In particular, we ask: what\nis the probability, Sm (t), that the inversion number remains smaller than m until time t. This \"survival\" probability is closely related to the first-passage probability as\n[\u2212dSm /dt] \u00d7 dt is the probability that the inversion number reaches m for the first time during the infinitesimal\ntime interval (t, t + dt).\nThe quantity S1 is the probability that the original\norder is perfectly maintained, or equivalently, the likelihood that none of the trajectories cross. This survival\nprobability decays as a power law, with a rather large\nexponent,\nS1 \u223c t\u2212N (N \u22121)/4 ,\n\n(14)\n\nin the long-time limit [29\u201334]. Our goal is to understand\nhow this asymptotic behavior changes as the threshold\nm increases.\n\n\f5\n0\n\nWhen N = 2, the separation between the two random\nwalks itself undergoes a random walk. Hence, S1 is equivalent to the survival probability of a one-dimensional random walk in the vicinity of a trap, and S1 \u223c t\u22121/2 in\nagreement with (14).\nWhen N = 3, we conveniently map the three random\nwalks onto a single \"compound\" random walk in three\ndimensions with the coordinates (x1 , x2 , x3 ). To find S1 ,\nwe require that the compound walk remains inside the\nregion x1 < x2 < x3 . We may view the boundary of this\nregion as absorbing, and then, S1 (t) equals the likelihood\nthat that the compound walk survives at time t. The absorbing boundary forms a wedge because it is defined by\nthe intersection of two planes, x1 = x2 and x2 = x3 . Generally, the survival probability of a particle that diffuses\ninside an absorbing wedge decays algebraically,\n\n10\n-1\n10\n-2\n10\n-3\n10\n-4\n10\nS6\n-5\n10\nS5\n-6\nS4\n10\n-7\nS3\n10\nS2\n-8\n10\n-9\n10 0\n7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nS \u223c t\u22121/(4V ) ,\n\nFIG. 4: The survival probability Sm (t) versus t for a fourparticle system. Shown are the quantities S2 (bottom curve),\nS3 , . . ., S6 (top curve). The number of independent Monte\nCarlo runs varies from 106 for the slowest decay to 1012 for\nthe fastest decay.\n\n(15)\n\nwhere V = \u03b1/\u03c0 is the normalized opening angle [35].\n(The opening angle 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0 is the angle between\nthe wedge axis and the wedge boundary.) Alternatively,\n0 < V \u2264 1 is the fraction of the total solid angle enclosed by the wedge. The region x1 < x2 < x3 occupies\n1\na fraction V1 = 3!\n= 16 of space and hence, S1 \u223c t\u22123/2 ,\nas also follows from (14). To find S2 and S3 , we note\nthat the regions in which the compound walk is allowed\nto move are always wedges (the three planes x1 = x2 ,\nx1 = x3 , and x2 = x3 divide space into six equal wedges\n[36].) Moreover, the fraction of total solid angle enclosed\nby the absorbing boundaries is given by the cumulative\n2\n1\n+ 3!\n= 12 and\ndistribution of inversion number: V2 = 3!\n2\n2\n5\n1\nV3 = 3! + 3! + 3! = 6 . Hence, all three survival probabilities decay algebraically with time [14],\nS1 \u223c t\u22123/2 ,\n\nS2 \u223c t\u22121/2 ,\n\nS3 \u223c t\u22123/10 ,\n\n(16)\n\nand there are three distinct first-passage exponents.\nThe asymptotic behaviors (16) suggest that all of the\nsurvival probabilities decay algebraically,\nSm \u223c t\u2212\u03b2m ,\n\n(17)\n\nin the long-time limit. Moreover, there is a large family\nof exponents\n\u03b21 > \u03b22 > * * * > \u03b2N (N \u22121)/2 ,\n\n(18)\n\nthat characterizes the power-law decay (17). We stress\nthat the exponents depend on two variables, the threshold m and the number of particles N , \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b2m (N ). We\nalready know the exact values \u03b21 (3) = 3/2, \u03b22 (3) = 1/2,\nand \u03b23 (3) = 3/10 as well as \u03b21 (N ) = N (N \u2212 1)/4.\nOur numerical simulations confirm that indeed, there\nis a large spectrum of exponents. As shown in Figure 4,\nthere are six decay exponents when N = 4. Table I lists\nthe numerically measured values \u03b2m , obtained from the\nlocal slope d ln Sm /d ln t.\nIn general, the compound walk is confined to a certain\n\"allowed\" region of space. This region is bounded by multiple intersecting planes of the type xi = xj with i 6= j,\n\nt\n\nand generally, this unbounded domain has a complicated\ngeometry. The boundary of this region encloses a fraction Vm (N ) of the total solid angle. On combinatorial\ngrounds alone, we conveniently deduce that this fraction\nis given by the cumulative Mahonian distribution\nVm (N ) =\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nPl (N ).\n\n(19)\n\nl=0\n\nSince the Mahonian distribution is symmetric, we have\nVm + VM+1\u2212m = 1. To evaluate Vm (N ), we expand the\ngenerating function (7), and for m \u2264 4, we have [5]\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nm = 1,\n\uf8f41\n\uf8f4\n1 \uf8f2N\nm = 2,\nVm (N ) =\n\u00d7 1\n(20)\n\uf8f4 2 (N \u2212 1)(N + 2)\nN! \uf8f4\nm = 3,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f31\n2\n6 (N + 1)(N + 2N \u2212 6) m = 4.\n\nWe have seen that the allowed region is a wedge when\nN = 3. To obtain an approximation for the first-passage\nexponents, we follow an approach that proved useful in\nother first-passage problems involving multiple random\nwalks and replace the boundary of the allowed region\nwith a suitably chosen cone in N \u2212 1 dimensions [37]. An\nunbounded cone with opening angle \u03b1 occupies a fraction\nV (\u03b1) of the total solid angle, given by\nR\u03b1\nd\u03b8 (sin \u03b8)N \u22123\n.\n(21)\nV (\u03b1) = R0\u03c0\nN \u22123\n0 d\u03b8 (sin \u03b8)\nIn d dimensions, we have d\u03a9 \u221d (sin \u03b8)d\u22122 d\u03b8 where \u03a9\nis the solid angle and \u03b8 is the polar angle in spherical\ncoordinates.

The values \u03b2m are from the Monte Carlo simulation\ncone\nresults shown in Figure 4. The values \u03b2m\nwere obtained using the cone approximation, specified in Eqs. (19)-(23). The\ncumulative Mahonian distribution, Vm , and the opening angle, \u03b1m , are listed as well.\n\nwith Vm given in (19).\nIn a cone, the first-passage exponent \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b2(\u03b1) decreases as the opening angle \u03b1 increases. In particular,\n\u03b2 = \u03c0/4\u03b1 in two dimensions, and \u03b2 = (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1)/2\u03b1 in four\ndimensions. Generally, however, \u03b2 is the smallest root of\nthe following transcendental equation involving the associated Legendre functions [38] of degree 2\u03b2 + \u03b3 and order\n\u03b3 = N 2\u22124 [17]\nQ\u03b32\u03b2+\u03b3 (cos \u03b1) = 0\n\nN odd,\n\n\u03b3\nP2\u03b2+\u03b3\n(cos \u03b1)\n\nN even.\n\n=0\n\n(23)\n\nRegardless of the dimension, the surface of a cone with\n\u03b1 = \u03c0/2 is a plane, and hence, \u03b2(\u03c0/2) = 1/2.\nFor example, to find \u03b21 (4), we first determine the frac1\n1\ntion V1 (4) = 4!\n= 24\nusing (19). Then, we calculate\nthe opening angle \u03b1 = 0.41113 using equations (21)-(22)\nand finally determine the exponent \u03b21 (4) = 2.67100 as\nthe appropriate root of equation (23). By construction,\nthe cone approximation is exact for three particles. This\napproach gives a useful approximation to the six firstpassage exponents when N = 4 (Table I). Remarkably,\nthe cone approximation continues to be a good approximation as the number of particles increases (Figure 5).\nVI.\n\nTHE SCALING FUNCTION\n\nWe are especially interested in the behavior when the\nnumber of particles is large. Let us first evaluate the\ncumulative Mahonian distribution in the large-N limit.\nSince the Mahonian distribution is normal, the cumulative distribution is given by the error function,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nz\n1 1\nVm (N ) \u2192 + erf \u221a\n,\n(24)\n2 2\n2\nwhen N \u2192 \u221e. Here, z is the scaling variable defined\n\u221a R\u03be\nin (9) and erf(\u03be) = (2/ \u03c0) 0 exp(\u2212u2 )du. To obtain\nEq. (24), we substitute (10) into (19) and convert the\nsum into an integral. Equation (24) is relevant in the\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e, m \u2192 \u221e with the scaling variable z finite.\nNext, we evaluate the solid angle enclosed by an unbounded cone when the dimension is large.

The scaling function, \u03b2(y), is specified by the\ntranscendental equation D2\u03b2 (y) = 0, where D\u03bd is the\nparabolic cylinder function of order \u03bd [38]. The smallest\nroot is the appropriate one [17].\nBy comparing equations (24) and (25), we find our\nmain result: the first-passage exponent depends on a single scaling variable,\n\u03b2m (N ) \u2192 \u03b2(z) with\n\nz=\n\nm \u2212 hmi\n,\n\u03c3\n\n(27)\n\nin the large-N limit.

The number of independent realizations varies from 104\nfor slow first-passage processes to 108 for fast one. The solid\nline shows the theoretical prediction (28).\n\ninvolving the parabolic cylinder function. When \u03b2 is a\nhalf-integer, the parabolic cylinder function is related to\nthe Hermite polynomials [38] and using this\n\u221a equivalence,\nwe have \u03b2(0) = 1/2, \u03b2(\u22121) = 1, and \u03b2(\u2212 3) = 3/2.\nOur numerical simulations (Figure 6) confirm that the\nexponents \u03b2m (N ) have the scaling form (27). Interestingly, the simulations strongly suggest that the scaling\nfunction predicted by the cone approximation is exact.\nWe note that the convergence to the infinite-particle limit\nis very fast for positive z, but much slower for negative\nz [17].\nWith the power-law decay (17), the mean first-passage\ntime diverges whenever \u03b2 < 1, but it is finite otherwise.\nSince \u03b2(z = \u22121) = 1, the time required for the inversion\nnumber to reach one standard deviation from the mean\nis infinite, on average. Regardless of the threshold z,\nthere is a considerable chance that the random walks\nare poorly mixed because the survival probability decays\n\nalgebraically.\nThe scaling behavior is remarkable for a number\nof reasons. First, the form of the scaling variable,\nz \u2261 (m \u2212 N 2 /4)/(N 3/2 /6), is quite unusual. Second,\nthere are roughly N 2 /2 first-passage exponents and numerical evaluation of this large spectrum is daunting.\nYet, the scaling form (27) gives the range of parameters for which \u03b2 is of order one, and hence, numerically\nmeasurable. (It is difficult to measure a vanishing exponent, \u03b2 \u2192 0, or a divergent exponent, \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.) Last,\nthe emergence of scaling laws for a family of scaling exponents is also intriguing. Typically, in Statistical Physics,\nthe opposite is true as one or two scaling exponents characterize a scaling law [39].\nThe extremal behaviors of the roots of the transcendental equation (28) are derived in ref. [17],\n(\nz 2 /8\nz \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\n\u0001\n\u03b2(z) \u223c p 2\n(29)\nz /8\u03c0 exp \u2212z 2 /2 z \u2192 \u221e.\n\nThe first-passage exponent is algebraically large if z is\nlarge and negative, but it is exponentially small if z is\nlarge and positive.\nThe exponential decay in (29) implies that it is extremely unlikely that the initial order is perfectly reversed. The smallest exponent \u03b2M characterizes the\nprobability SM that the order of the walkers does not\nturn into the mirror image of the initial state, that is, the\nprobability that the compound walk remains in the exterior of the so-called \"Weyl chamber\" x1 < x2 < * * * < xN\n[29\u201334]. This domain has VM = 1 \u2212 N1 ! , and Table II lists\nthe outcome of the cone approximation for small N . To\nfind the outcome of the cone approximation at large N ,\nwe first estimate the opening angle, \u03c0\u2212\u03b1 \u2243\n\u221ae/N by using\nEq. (21) and the Stirling formula N ! \u2243 2\u03c0N (N/e)N .\nFrom the asymptotic\nbehavior for wide cones at large dip\nmensions, \u03b2 \u2243 N/8\u03c0(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1)N \u22123 [17], we conclude [37]\n\u03b2M \u2243\n\nN4\n.\n2 e3 N !\n\n(30)\n\nThis value is extremely small, decaying roughly as the\ninverse of a factorial, and it is impossible to measure\nsuch a minuscule quantity using numerical simulations.\nThe largest exponent describes the probability that the\nparticles maintain the initial order or that the compound\nwalk remains in the interior of the Weyl chamber with\nV1 = N1 ! . Table II compares the outcome of the cone approximation with the exact value \u03b21 = N (N \u2212 1)/4. The\n\n\f8\nquality of the cone approximation worsens as N grows.\nNevertheless, the cone approximation is qualitatively correct. By substituting the opening angle \u03b1 \u2243 e/N into\nthe thin-cone asymptotic behavior \u03b2(\u03b1) \u2243 N \u03b1\u22121 /4 [17],\nwe find \u03b21 \u2243 N 2 /(4e). This expression captures the\nquadratic growth of the exponent. Remarkably, the cone\napproximation is exact inside the scaling region, but it is\nonly approximate outside this region.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we used the number of pair inversions\nto measure the one-dimensional mixing of independent\ndiffusing trajectories. A high inversion number typifies\nstrong mixing whereas a persistent small inversion number indicates poor mixing. In the steady-state, the distribution of inversion number is given by the well-known\nMahonian distribution, and consequently, it is Gaussian\nwhen the number of particles is large. Preceding the\nsteady-state is a transient regime in which both the average inversion number and the standard deviation grow\ndiffusively with time.\nWe focused on first-passage statistics and showed that\nthe probability that the inversion number does not exceed a certain threshold decays as power law with time.\nMoreover, we found that a large spectrum of decay exponents characterizes the asymptotic behavior. When the\nnumber of particles is large, the exponents obey a universal scaling function. The scaling variable equals the\ndistance between the threshold inversion number and the\naverage inversion number, measured in terms of the stan-\n\n[1] P. A. McMahon, Amer. J.

This approach is exact for three particles, it\nproduces very good estimates in higher dimensions, and\nremarkably, this framework yields the exact scaling function. The cone approximation gives lower bounds for the\ndecay exponents because, among all unbounded domains\nwith the same solid angle, the perfectly circular cone\nmaximizes the survival probability [37, 40, 41]. The cone\napproximation is useful in answering other first-passage\nquestions such as the probability that the nth rightmost\nrandom walk does not cross the origin and the probability\nthat the original rightmost particle always remains ahead\nof at least n other particles [37]. In both cases, there are\nas many exponents as there are particles, and curiously,\nthe circular cone framework produces the scaling function governing the first-passage exponents approximately\nin the first case and exactly in the second case.\nUnderstanding when the cone approximation is exact\nand when it is approximate is an interesting challenge,\nwith implications well beyond first-passage [42\u201344]. The\nfirst-passage exponent is directly related to the lowest\neigenvalue of the Laplace operator, and therefore, we conclude that the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian similarly\nobeys scaling laws in high dimensions. The shape of the\nscaling function depends on the actual geometry [45].\nI thank Paul Krapivsky and Timothy Wallstrom for\nuseful discussions.
