Explicit formulae for the gauge theory actions are provided.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction and Summary\n\nIn this paper we consider mass-deformations of 2 + 1 dimensional supersymmetric YangMills theories, defined on R3 or R \u00d7 T 2 , and their connections to supermembrane theories.\nIn particular we show that all known mass-deformed models of supersymmetric matrix\nquantum mechanics (SMQM), obtained recently by deforming dimensional reductions of\nminimal super Yang-Mills theories in dimensions ten, six, four and three[22], can also be\nderived as dimensional reductions of appropriate mass-deformations of super Yang-Mills\ntheories in three spacetime dimensions. We thus propose a novel connection between a class\nof Poincare invariant massive gauge theories in three dimensional flat spacetimes and massdeformed SMQM, which are closely related to matrix regularizations of supermembrane\ntheories in plane wave type backgrounds.\nIt is, of course, well known that super Yang-Mills theories and matrix models are closely\nrelated. Perhaps the best studied example of this connection is between minimal super YangMills in ten dimensions and the BFSS matrix model of eleven dimensional supergravity[8].\nRecently, a class of supersymmetric matrix models with discrete spectra, which are connected both to Yang-Mills theories as well as to membranes in non-trivial backgrounds have\nbeen intensely studied. For instance, the N = 16 SMQM derived by Berenstein, Maldacena\nand Nastase (BMN) realizes the matrix regularization of eleven dimensional supermembranes in the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background[10]. This matrix model has\na number of interesting features. For example, it does not suffer from the usual problem\nof the existence of flat directions. The presence of explicit mass terms in the Hamiltonian\nrenders it's spectrum discrete, thus lifting the flat directions. It possesses massive BPS\nstates[9, 11, 12, 13] and it's non-BPS spectrum can be studied in perturbation theory. Furthermore the large N perturbation theory of the model can be reformulated in the language\nof quantum spin chains. To the extent that it has been possible to test so far, the spin\nchains that follow from the BMN matrix model turn out to be integrable[14, 15, 16]. The\nBMN matrix model is also closely tied to gauge theories in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions. As\na matter of fact, it can be derived from both N = 4 SYM on R \u00d7 S 3 and N = 8 SYM\non R \u00d7 S 2 by dimensional reduction[28, 18, 19]. Conversely, it can also be 'oxidized', upon\nan expansion around it's fuzzy sphere vacuum to produce the maximally supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory on R \u00d7 S 2 [9]. Furthermore, the quantum spectrum of the matrix model\nalso appears to be extremely closely related to the perturbative spectra of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mill theories on R \u00d7 S 3 [20, 14] and R \u00d7 S 2 [21]. This chain of connections\nhints at a remarkably close connection between higher dimensional gauge theories on curved\nbackgrounds and mass deformed matrix models that clearly merits further study.\nA systematic classification of all the supersymmetry preserving mass-deformations of\n1\n\n\fdimensional reductions of minimal Yang-Mills theories in various dimensions (down to D =\n0 + 1), was recently carried out in[22]. It is only natural to ask what the gauge theoretic\norigins of these matrix models are. A partial answer to that question is already provided by\nthe connection of the BMN matrix model to super Yang-Mills theories on R\u00d7S 3 and R\u00d7S 2\nmentioned above. Building on this result it is natural to think that it is necessary to consider\nYang-Mills Hamiltonians on curved compact spaces to connect them to massive SMQM.\nTypically one expects the masses for the scalars corresponding to the spacial components of\nthe gauge fields to be non-vanishing if the spacial manifold for the gauge theory is compact\nand curved e.g S 3 or S 2 . In this paper we show that SMQM models can also be derived by\ndimensionally reduced massive gauge theories on flat backgrounds such as R3 or R \u00d7 T 2 .\nIn particular we connect all the mass deformed SMQM Lagrangians in[22] to dimensional\nreductions of mass deformations of super Yang-Mills theories on flat backgrounds in D =\n2 + 1.\nMass-deformations of Yang-Mills theories require mass terms for the gluon degrees of\nfreedom. In the special case of 2 + 1 dimensions a gauge and Poincare invariant mass term\nfor pure Yang-Mills theory was used by Alexanian and Nair (AN)in[1] to estimate the nonperturbative mass-gap of the gauge theory. This mass-term was first proposed by Nair as a\nmagnetic mass-term for high temperature QCD1 . It is very closely related to the (electric)\nDebye mass term that arise from the re-summation of hard thermal loops in a quark-gluon\nplasma[2]. This particular term removes all the massless modes from the theory, and thus\nprovides a natural IR regulator for the three dimensional gauge theory as well. In what\nis to follow later in the paper, we use the action due to Alexanian and Nair to make the\ngluonic degrees of freedom of the relevant three dimensional gauge theories massive.\nThere now exists a very robust and powerful Hamiltonian formalism for Yang-Mills\ntheory in D = 2 + 1 due to Kim, Karabali and Nair (KKN)[7, 4, 5, 3], that can account for\nseveral non-perturbative features of the gauge theory including the existence of a mass-gap\nin its spectrum. Indeed, the term proposed by Alexanian and Nair is closely tied to the\nmechanism leading to the non-perturbative mass gap in the spectrum of the gauge theory\nin the KKN Hamiltonian formalism. In the gauge invariant Hamiltonian formulation of the\ntheory, the gap is ultimately related to the volume measure on the configuration space of the\ngauge theory, which can be computed and expressed as a hermitian Wess-Zumino-Witten\nmodel[4, 7]. Though it is not completely clear how to pass from the non-local Hamiltonian\nformalism due to KKN to a covariant path-integral framework, a prescription for doing\nso, based upon the covariantization of the KKN formalism was proposed in[3]. Requiring\nmanifest Lorentz covariance of the formalism led to two different possibilities for potential\n1\n\nRecall that at finite temperature the magnetic sector of Yang-Mills theory in D = 3 + 1 is effectively\ndescribed by Euclidean D = 2 + 1 Yang-Mills theory\n\n2\n\n\fgauge invariant mass-terms that one may consider in the path integral framework, and one\nof these was the term proposed in [2] from finite temperature QCD considerations. Thus,\neven though requiring covariantization does not uniquely fix the form of the mass-term that\nis dynamically generated in the gauge theory path integral, it does limit the possibilities\ndown to two. Intriguingly, as we show later in the paper, of these two candidate mass-terms\nonly one, namely the one used by Alexanian and Nair [1], reduces to standard quadratic\nmass term for matrix quantum mechanics upon dimensional reduction. Thus, along with\nmanifest covariance, requiring that the non-local mass term for the gauge theory reduce\nto the standard Gaussian terms for the dimensionally reduced theory, uniquely relates the\nnon-perturbative mass-gap and the volume measure on the configuration space of the gauge\ntheory to the non-local Lorentz and gauge invariant mass term due to Alexanian and Nair.\nGenerating the standard (Gaussian) mass terms for the matrices corresponding to the\ngluonic degrees of freedom by dimensionally reducing the AN mass-term opens up the\npossibility of relating mass-deformed SMQM to mass-deformations of supersymmetric YangMills theories in three dimensions via dimensional reduction. One can consider the AN\nterm to deform the 'pure-glue' part of the theory and use standard quadratic mass-terms\nfor the matter degrees of freedom. As stated in the beginning, we show that all the known\nmass-deformations of SMQM Hamiltonians obtained by dimensional reductions of various\nminimal super Yang-Mill theories[22], can be derived as dimensional reductions of mass\ndeformed three dimensional super Yang-Mills theories.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide a self-contained\nreview of the mass-deformation of purely gluonic three dimensional Yang-Mills theory due\nto Alexanian and Nair. In particular we focus on how the equations of motion of the\ntheory can be brought to a form that involve only local variables, even though the AN\nmass-term is highly non-local. We also review the Minkowski space continuation of this\nmass term as suggested in[3]. In the next section we focus on the dimensional reduction\nof the mass-deformed Hamiltonian by Toroidal compactification of the spacial dimensions.\nWe also comment on how the dimensional reduction can be used to uniquely connect the\nAN mass term to the KKN Hamiltonian analysis. In the section following this, we present\nthe list of various mass deformations of super Yang-Mills actions in D = 2 + 1 that reduce\nto massive SMQM theories derived in[22]. The explicit formulae for the SMQM actions and\ndome other relevant details are also presented in the appendix for the sake of completeness.\nWe end the paper with some concluding remarks.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nMassive Yang-Mills in D = 2 + 1\n\nWe start with the Euclidean action for pure Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions with the\ngauge invariant mass term (Sm ) included.\nZ\n1 a a\n1\nS = d3 x 2 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03bc\u03bd + 2 Sm .\n(1)\n4g\ng\nSm [1] can be written as\nSm = \u2212m2\nThe vector fields A\u00b1 are defined as\nA+ =\n\nZ\n\ndx0 d\u03a9K(A+ , A\u2212 )\n\nA\u03bc n\u0304\u03bc\nA\u03bc n\u03bc\n, A\u2212 =\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere n, n\u0304 are three dimensional complex null-vectors\n~n = (\u2212 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 \u2212 i sin \u03c6, \u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6 + i cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8).\n\n(4)\n\nd\u03a9 = sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6 is the volume measure on the two-sphere.\nIt should be kept in mind that the sphere only provides two auxiliary angular coordinates\nwhich are used to construct two dimensional quantities (e.g. A\u00b1 ) out of their three dimensional counterparts in a somewhat twistorial fashion. These coordinates are integrated over\nand are not related to the underlying spacetime coordinates in any way. The kernel K is\ngiven by\nZ\n1\nK(A+ , A\u2212 ) =\n(Tr(A+ (1)A\u2212 (1)) + i\u03c0I(A+ (1)) + i\u03c0I(A\u2212 (1)))\n(5)\n\u03c0 1\nwhere\nI(A(1)) = i\n\nX (\u22121)n Z\nn\n\nn\n\n2***n\n\nTr(A(1) * * * A(n)) d2 x1\nd2 xn\n***\n.\nz\u030412 z\u030423 * * * z\u0304n1\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nThe arguments of A refer to the different 'spacial' points. The transverse coordinate x0 is\nthe same for all the A's in the above expression for I. The complex coordinate\nz\u0304 = n\u03bc x\u03bc .\nAlternatively, the mass term can also be formally expressed as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA+ A\u2212\n+ ln(D+ ) + ln(D\u2212 )\nK(A+ , A\u2212 ) = Tr\n\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere D\u00b1 = \u2202\u00b1 + A\u00b1 . The trace in the above expression stands for the trace over the color\nindices as well as the integration over the transverse coordinates.

Indeed,\nthat is the key result in[1], where Sm was shown to arise by the re-summation of an infinite\nclass of Feynman diagrams.\n\n2.1\n\nEquations of Motion:\n\nAlthough the 'mass-term' for the gluons is a highly non-local quantity, involving an infinite\nnumber of interaction vertices, its contribution to the equations of motion can be cast in\nlocal form at the expense of introducing an auxiliary field. This is what we summarize next.\nThe variation of the mass term can be expressed as2 :\nZ\n\u03b4Sm\nm2\na\n(J a n\u03bc + J\u2212\nn\u0304\u03bc ).\n=\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc\n4\u03c0g2 \u03a9 +\n\n(10)\n\nThe currents\nJ\u00b1 = A\u00b1 \u2212 a\u00b1\n\n(11)\n\ninvolve the auxiliary fields a\u00b1 , which stem from the variation of the non-local 'Tr ln' term.\nSpecifically:\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n3\n\u03b4Tr ln(D+ ) = \u2212\nd xTr(a\u2212 (x)\u03b4A+ (x)), \u03b4Tr ln(D\u2212 ) = \u2212\nd3 xTr(a+ (x)\u03b4A\u2212 (x)).\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n(12)\nClearly, the auxiliary fields involve the greens functions for the D\u00b1 operators at coincident\npoints, which require careful regularizations. Different choices of regularizations can change\nthe numerical value of the mass gap by adding different local counter-terms to the action.\nHence, the choice of regularization should be regarded as part of the definition of the theory.\nFormally, we can express\nZ 2\nX\nd z1 d2 z2\nA+ (1) * * * A+ (n)\nd2 zn\nn\u22121\na\u2212 (z) =\n(\u22121)\n***\n.\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n(z\u0304\n\u2212\nz\u0304\n1 )(z\u03041 \u2212 z\u03042 ) * * * (z\u0304n \u2212 z\u0304)\nn\n\n(13)\n\nThere is a similar expression for a+ .

However, once the choice is made, we can regard equations (14) as the\nequations of motion for the auxiliary fields.\n\nGathering together everything so far, we see that the equations of motion of the massive\ntheory can be written as:\nZ\nm2\na\na\n\u2212 D\u03bc F\u03bc\u03bd +\n(J a n\u03bd + J+\nn\u0304\u03bd ) = 0,\n4\u03c0 \u03a9 \u2212\nD+ a\u2212 = \u2202\u2212 A+ ,\nD\u2212 a+ = \u2202+ A\u2212 .\n(16)\nWe also note that the last equation for the auxiliary fields implies that\nD+ J\u2212 + D\u2212 J+ = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nD\u03bc J\u03bc = 0.\n\n(17)\n\nIn other words the current J is covariantly conserved.\nWe thus see that although the mass term that we consider is non-local, the equations of\nmotion implied by it can be brought to a manifestly local form, at the expense of the\nintroduction of the auxiliary variables.\nWe also note an important consequence of the equations of motion of the massive theory;\nnamely:\nD[\u03bc J\u03bd] = 2F\u03bc\u03bd .\n(18)\nThis can be derived by contracting the tensor D[\u03bc J\u03bd] with n, n\u0304 to get\n(D[\u03bc J\u03bd] \u2212 2F\u03bc\u03bd )n\u03bc n\u0304\u03bd = 0\n\n\u2192\n\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (D[\u03bc J\u03bd] \u2212 2F\u03bc\u03bd )x\u03c1 = 0\n\n(19)\n\nwhere x\u03c1 \u2208 S 2 . Since this relation is true for arbitrary points on S 2 , (18) is implied as it's\nconsequence.\n\n2.2\n\nMinkowski Continuation\n\nFor the purposes of mass-deforming supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, it is imperative\nto consider the analytic continuation of the mass-term to Minkowski space. An elegant\nprescription for doing that was proposed in[3]. In this section we provide a brief review of\nthe analytic continuation suggested in[3].\nTo continue the results to Minkowski space, one needs to de-compactify one of the angles\n(\u03b8) in (4). The ensuing null vectors would then be given by\nn\u03bc = (cosh(\u03b8) cos(\u03c6) \u2212 i sin(\u03c6), cosh(\u03b8) sin(\u03c6) + i cos(\u03c6), sinh(\u03b8))\nn\u0304\u03bc = (cosh(\u03b8) cos(\u03c6) + i sin(\u03c6), cosh(\u03b8) sin(\u03c6) \u2212 i cos(\u03c6), sinh(\u03b8)).\n6\n\n(20)\n\n\fHowever, using this naive continuation of the mass term leads to divergent integrals over\nthe non-compact Lorentz group SO(2, 1). The regularization of these integrals suggested\nin [3] involves the introduction of the operators\nS \u03bc = \u0101t\u03bc t2 \u0101T , S\u0304 \u03bc = aT t2 t\u03bc a\n\n(21)\n\nbuilt out of the oscillators (ai , \u0101i ), i = 1, 2, which transform as doublets of SO(2, 1) and\nsatisfy the commutation relations\n[ai , \u0101j ] = \u03b4ij .\n(22)\nIt is also understood that the superscript 'T ' in (21) refers to transpose while t\u03bc are the Lie\nalgebra generators of SO(2, 1).\nt\u03bc = (i\u03c3 1 , i\u03c3 2 , \u03c3 3 ).\n(23)\nThe spin operators provide a finite regularization of the null-vectors in the sense that\nS \u03bc S\u03bc = S\u0304 \u03bc S\u0304\u03bc = 0 S \u03bc S\u0304\u03bc = 2(Q2 \u2212 Q)\n\n(24)\n\nwhere Q = \u0101i ai is an SO(2, 1) invariant. A construction that is very reminiscent of fuzzy\nspheres was carried out in [3] to regulate the integrals over the Lorentz group. One constructs states with a fixed value of Q which we denote by M \u2212 1. Such states are given\nby\n1\n|r, s >= \u221a\n\u0101r1 \u0101s2 |0 > .\n(25)\nr!s!\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nIn the large M limit, the re-scaled operators S\u0303 \u03bc = S , S\u0304 \u0303\u03bc = S\u0304 commute and can be\nM\n\nM\n\nthought of as 'classical' quantities. They remain null, while their dot product is given by\nS\u0303 \u03bc S\u0304 \u0303\u03bc = 2.\n\n(26)\n\nThis construction allows one to define finite regularized integrals over the Lorentz group as\nZ\n1\nd\u03bcSO(2,1) F (n, n\u0304) \u21d2\nTrF (S\u0303, S\u0304 \u0303)M \u2192\u221e .\n(27)\nM\nP =1\nthe trace on the r.h.s above refers to M\nr,s=0 < r, s|F |r, s >, while d\u03bcSO(2,1) = d(cosh(\u03b8))d\u03c6.\nWith the Minkowski continuation of the null-vectors and the associated integration over\nthe Lorentz group defined as above, we can express the Minkowskian mass-deformed action\nof Yang-Mills theory as\nZ\nZ\n1\n4\u03c0m2\n3\na\na \u03bc\u03bd\nSM in = \u2212 2 d x(F )\u03bc\u03bd (F ) +\ndx0 d\u03bcSO(2,1) K(A+ , A\u2212 ).\n(28)\n4g\ng2\nK is the same functional of A\u00b1 as in the Euclidean case with the Euclidean null vectors\nare replaced by their Minkowski counterparts (20). The equations of motion can also be\n7\n\n\freadily derived to be:\n\u2212 D\u03bc (F a )\u03bc\u03bd + m2\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\na \u03bd\na \u03bd\n(J\u2212\nn + J+\nn\u0304 ) = 0,\n\nD+ a\u2212 = \u2202\u2212 A+ ,\n\nD\u2212 a+ = \u2202+ A\u2212 .\n\n(29)\n\nTheir formal structure remains the same as in the Euclidean case.\n\n3\n\nCompactification on T 2\n\nWe shall now consider the reduction of the massive Yang-Mills theory to 0+1 dimensions by\ncompactifying the spacial directions on a T 2 . As is well known, the dimensional reduction\nof pure 3D Yang-Mills reduces to matrix quantum mechanics of two matrices; the matrices\nbeing the zero modes of A1 and A2 . The dimensional reduction of the non-local mass term is\nmuch more involved. In principle it contains an infinite number of interaction vertices, which\ncan lead to a complicated contributions to the action of the reduced quantum mechanical\nsystem. It is thus instructive to look at the first few interaction vertices generated by the\nmass term. We shall adhere to the Euclidean version of the mass term in the following\nanalysis. A straightforward, but lengthy computation allows one to write:\nZ\n\u2212 dx0 d\u03a9K(A+ , A\u2212 ) = K2 + K3 + K4 + * * *\n(30)\n\nK3 =\n\nZ\n\nki ,\u03a9\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2 Aa\u03bd (\u2212k)\nk\nk\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\ni\n1\nk2 .n\u0304 k3 .n\u0304\nTr (A(k1 ).n[A(k2 ).n, A(k3 ).n])\n\u2212\n.\n12\u03c0\nk1 .n k2 .n k3 .n\n1\nK2 =\n2\n\nZ\n\nAa\u03bc (k)\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nwhile\nK4 = \u2212\n\n1\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nki ,\u03a9\n\nTr(A.n(k1 ) * * * A.n(k4 ))\nk3 .n + k4 .n\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nk2 .n\n\n\u0012\n\nk3 .n\u0304 k4 .n\u0304\n\u2212\nk3 .n k4 .n\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nk1 .n\n\n\u0012\n\nk3 .n\u0304 k4 .n\u0304\n\u2212\nk3 .n k4 .n\n\n\u0013\u0013\n\n(33)\n\nConservation of momenta is implied in the above formulae.\nIf we restrict all the momenta in the integrands to the form (k, 0, 0) which amounts to a\ndimensional reduction, we see that K3 , K4 vanish. Moreover, K2 reduces to an ordinary\nquadratic mass term commensurate with the mass deformation of a gauged matrix quantum\nmechanical model. The fifth and higher point vertices will similarly vanish upon dimensional\nreduction if linear combinations of the structure\n\u0013\n\u0012\nki .n\u0304 kj .n\u0304\n\u2212\nVij =\n(34)\nki .n kj .n\n8\n\n\fcan be factored out of their integrands. The natural question that arises is whether this\ndoes indeed happen. The simplest way to see that is does is by considering the variation of\nthe mass term. In particular, if we consider the variation of the holomorphic determinant,\nwe see, from the very definition of a\u2212 :\n1\n\u03b4Tr ln(\u2202+ + A+ ) = \u2212 Tr(a\u2212 \u03b4A+ ).\n\u03c0\n\n(35)\n\nHowever, the equations of motion for a\u2212 (16) D+ a\u2212 = \u2202\u2212 A+ , and its conjugate, can be\nreadily solved when A+ and A\u2212 depend on only one of the three spacial coordinates, which\nwe denote by the '0' direction. A particularly simple solution is given by\na+ =\n\nn0\nA\u2212 ,\nn\u03040\n\na\u2212 =\n\nn\u03040\nA+ .\nn0\n\n(36)\n\nThis allows us to integrate (35) (and its conjugate) and express the dimensional reduction\nof the determinants in closed form as:\nTr ln(\u2202+ + A+ )0+1 = \u2212\n\n1 k.n\n1 k.n\u0304\nTr(A+ A+ ), Tr ln(\u2202\u2212 + A\u2212 )0+1 = \u2212\nTr(A\u2212 A\u2212 ). (37)\n2\u03c0 k.n\n2\u03c0 k.n\u0304\n\nwhere the 'momentum' k = (1, 0, 0). Hence we can express the dimensional reduction of\nthe mass term as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nA+ A\u2212\n1 k.n\u0304\n1 k.n\n2\n3\n(Sm )0+1 = \u2212m\nd xd\u03a9Tr\n\u2212\nTr(A+ A+ ) \u2212\nTr(A\u2212 A\u2212 ) .\n(38)\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0 k.n\n2\u03c0 k.n\u0304\nAfter evaluating the angular integrals, we have\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\nZ\nkj kl\nm 2 VM 2\n(Sm )0+1 = \u2212\ndx0 Tr Aj \u03b4jl \u2212 2 Al .\n2\nk\n\n(39)\n\nIn other words,\n(Sm )0+1 = \u2212\n\nm2 VM 2\n2\n\nZ\n\nwhere VM 2 /2 is the volume of T 2 .\n\n\uf8ee\n\ndx0 Tr \uf8f0\n\nX\n\nl=1,2\n\n\uf8f9\n\nAl Al \uf8fb ,\n\n(40)\n\nGathering together the results for the dimensional reduction of the Euclidean case, we\nhave\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n1 a a\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0+1\nd3 x 2 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03bc\u03bd + 2 Sm \u2192\n(Dt \u03a6i Dt \u03a6i + m2 \u03a6i \u03a6i ) \u2212 [\u03a6i , \u03a6j ]2 .

To get the Minkowski\nversion of the action we need to dimensionally reduce (28). The steps involved are exactly\nthe same as the Euclidean case only the angular integrals need to be evaluated with the\nregularization prescription discussed earlier.

One can use the gauge\ninvariant Hamiltonian (KKN) formalism, which does offer a 'first-principles' derivation of\nthe mass-gap in the purely gluonic theory, to study the potential mass terms that one can\nemploy in a path integral formalism. A covariantization of the KKN framework[3], led to\ntwo different possibilities for potential mass-terms. One of these terms is the one that we\n2 found in [3], differs from the one at hand by\nhave discussed above. The second term Sm\nterms that have the schematic form\n2\n= O(A3 ) + O(A4 ) + * * *\nSm\n\n(45)\n\nThese extra terms prevent the reduction of the second mass-term to the standard Gaussian\nones relevant for gauged matrix models. Thus, the apparently simple extra condition that\nthe massive gauge theory reduce to matrix quantum mechanics with quadratic mass terms\nuniquely picks out the term due to Alexanian and Nair as the convariant completion of the\nvolume measure on configuration space of Yang-Mills theory in three dimensions.\nSm Vs Chern-Simons:\nThe spectrum for three dimensional gauge theories can also be rendered massive by the\naddition of Chern-Simons terms. However the physical implications and origins of the\nmass-term we use are very different from Chern-Simons terms. Sm used in this paper is\ndynamically generated by pure Yang-Mills theory, as was shown in [1, 3]. In other words,\nSm provides a potential explanation for the short-ranged nature of the strong force in three\ndimensions without changing the confining behavior of the theory. On the other hand, the\naddition of a Chern-Simons term, drastically changes the physical behavior of the theory,\nfrom confinement to screening[6]. However, there is close relation between the two mass\nterms, as the functional I used in the definition of Sm is nothing but the eikonal of a Chern-\n\n10\n\n\fSimons action. This has been elaborated at length in the context of finite temperature QCD\nin [24, 25, 2, 26, 27].\n\n4\n\nDimensional Reduction of SUSY Gauge Theories\n\nIn this section we present the details of the mass deformations of super Yang-Mills theories\nN = 8, 4, 2and1 supersymmetries that reduce to matrix model Hamiltonians of [22] upon\ndimensional reduction. We shall adhere to the conventions of [22] in the following. It is\nshown in [22] that MSQM models with N = 4 and 8 supersymmetries admit two different\nclasses of mass-deformations, types I and II. The so called type I deformations allow for\nSO(3) symmetric Myers terms in the matrix model Lagrangians, while type II deformations\ndo not. This would imply two different types of mass deformations for the N = 4 and 2\nYang-Mills theories as well. In the case of N = 16 matrix mechanics, there is a unique\ndeformation that corresponds to the BMN matrix model. However, as we shall see, there\nare two different gauge theory Lagrangians (depending on whether the theory is defined\non R3 or R \u00d7 T 2 ) that reduce to it. Similarly, we find two distinct gauge theory actions\ncorresponding to the type I mass deformation of the N = 8 SMQM as well. For N = 1\nsuper-Yang-Mills, we shall have a unique choice of mass deformation both at the gauge\ntheory as well as at the matrix model level.\n\n4.1\n\nThe 16 Supercharge Theory\n\nThe un-deformed action is given by\nZ 3\nd x 1\n1\ni\nS0 =\n(\u2212 (F\u03bc\u03bd )a (F \u03bc\u03bd )a \u2212 (D\u03bc \u03a6I )a (D \u03bc \u03a6I )a \u2212 \u03a8\u2020a \u0393\u03bc (D\u03bc \u03a8)a\n2\ng\n4\n2\n2\ni abc \u2020a I b c 1 amn apq m n p q\n\u2212 f \u03a8 \u0393 \u03a6I \u03a8 \u2212 f\nf \u03a6I \u03a6J \u03a6I \u03a6J ).\n2\n4\n\n(46)\n\nThe massless theory has seven scalars with a manifest SO(7) R symmetry. To relate it to\nthe plane wave matrix model with an SO(3) \u00d7 SO(6) R-charge symmetry, we can choose\nthree of the scalars of the gauge theory to transform under an SO(3) with masses \u03bc3 . The\ntwo scalar fields that arise from the dimensional reduction of the gauge potential can then\nbe chosen to combine with the remaining scalars to transform under an SO(6) with their\nmass equal to \u03bc6 . The complete action of the mass deformed theory can be expressed as\nS = S0 + S\u03bc .\n\n11\n\n(47)\n\n\fS0 is given by (46) while\n\u0010\u03bc\u0011\nS\u03bc = S\n6 min\n!\n\u0012 \u0013 9\nZ 3\n6\nd x 1 \u0010 \u03bc \u00112 X a a 1 2\u03bc 2 X a a\ni\u03bc \u2020a 789 a \u03bc abc\n\u03a6I \u03a6I +\n\u2212\n\u03a6I \u2032 \u03a6I \u2032 \u2212 \u03a8 \u0393 \u03a8 \u2212 f \u01ebI \u2032 J \u2032 K \u2032 \u03a6aI\u2032 \u03a6bJ \u2032 \u03a6cK \u2032 .(48)\ng2\n2 6\n2 6\n8\n6\n\u2032\nI =7\n\nI=3\n\nIt is understood that the dashed indices take on the values 7, 8, 9.

Namely\nZ\n4\u03c0m2\nS(m)min =\ndx0 d\u03bcSO(2,1) K(A+ , A\u2212 ).\n(49)\ng2\n\nReduction from R \u00d7 T 2 :\nThe mass deformation given above is the unique Poincare invariant theory defined on R3\nthat reduces to the BMN matrix model. However, if one defines the theory on R \u00d7 T 2 ,\nthen it is interesting to note that there is yet another mass deformation (particular to the\nspacial manifold being a T 2 ) that reproduces the maximally supersymmetric massive matrix\nmechanics as well. This particular mass deformation corresponds to identifying the scalar\nfields due to the spacial components of the gauge potential as two of the three fields that\ntransform under the SO(3). For this purpose it is instructive to identify the 0, 8 and 9\ndirections in (46) as associated with R and T 2 respectively, while the index I runs from\n1 * * * 7. The mass relevant term S\u0303\u03bc can be expressed as:\nS\u0303\u03bc = S\n\n\u0010\u03bc\u0011\n3\n\nmin\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nR\u00d7T 2\n\n1\ng2\n\n6\n\n1 \u0010 \u03bc \u00112 X a a 1\n\u03a6I \u03a6I +\n2 6\n2\nI=1\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03bc\n6\n\n\u00132\n\n!\ni\u03bc\na a\n\u03a6a7 \u03a6a7 \u2212 \u03a8\u2020a \u0393789 \u03a8a \u2212 \u03bcF89\n\u03a67 .(50)\n8\n\nThe only decompactification of the theory from R \u00d7 T 2 to R3 that produces a maximally\nsupersymmetric theory while preserving Poincare invariance involves scaling the masses as\n1\n2\nL , L being the size of the T . In this case, one will simple get back the massless gauge\ntheory upon decompactification, while the restriction to the zero modes on T 2 would result\nin the plane wave matrix model. One could alternatively consider scaling the coefficient\nof the F \u03a6 interaction term as L1 and not the masses of the scalars. In this case, the\ndecompactified theory would recover Poincare invariance but would no longer be maximally\nsupersymmetric. Both the mass deformations reduce to the BMN matrix model (A3) upon\ndimensional reduction.\n\n4.2\n\nThe Case of N = 4, 2 and 1 SYM\n\nFor super-Yang-Mills theories with less supersymmetries, one can carry out analogous constructions and relate them to mass-deformed matrix models with N = 8, 4 and 2 supersymmetries.\n12\n\n\fN = 4SY M :\nThe un-deformed N = 4SY M action in D = 2 + 1 is given by\nZ 3\nd x 1\n1\ni\nS0 =\n(\u2212 (F\u03bc\u03bd )a (F \u03bc\u03bd )a \u2212 (D\u03bc \u03a6I )a (D \u03bc \u03a6I )a \u2212 \u03a8\u0304a \u0393\u03bc (D\u03bc \u03a8)a\n2\ng\n4\n2\n2\ni abc a I b c 1 amn apq m n p q\n\u2212 f \u03a8\u0304 \u0393 \u03a6I \u03a8 \u2212 f\nf \u03a6I \u03a6J \u03a6I \u03a6J ).\n2\n4\n\n(51)\n\nThis is nothing but the dimensional reduction of N = 6 SYM from D = 6 to D = 3. The\ntheory has three scalars. We can denote the directions associated with the scalars as 3, 4\nand 5.\nType I Mass Deformation:\nAs in the case of the sixteen supercharge theory, there are two distinct mass terms, depending on whether the theory is defined on R3 or on R \u00d7 T 2 , that reduce to the appropriate\nmass terms for the matrix model. In the later case, it is useful to identify 0, 4 and 5 as the\nR and T 2 directions to avoid changing the form of the Fermion mass term.

Consequently,\nthe mass terms for the gauge theory are the same whether the theory is defined on R3 or\nR \u00d7 T 2 . To match with the conventions used in[22], it is once again useful to identify 0, 4, 5\nas the 'Lorentz' directions and let the sum over I run from 1 to 3 in (51).

In\nparticular, it is important to understand whether or not these theories are supersymmetric\nthemselves. This is an issue that we are currently investigating and we hope to report on\nit in the near future.\nAnother possibility that possibly merits further study is that of integrability. Many of\nthe massive matrix models that the gauge theories reduce to are known to be integrable in\nthe large N limit to various orders in perturbation theory. For, instance, the BMN matrix\nmodel exhibits perturbative integrability up to the four loops order, at least in the SU (2)\nsector[15, 14, 16]. The type I mass deformations of the N = 8 and 4 matrix models (A4,\n14\n\n\fA6), as well as the case of the N = 2 SMQM (A8) yield integrable spin chains at the one\nloop order in perturbation theory as well[23]. This raises the exciting possibility of the\ncorresponding gauge theories being integrable, at least to low orders in perturbation theory.\nClearly this aspect of the massive gauge theories merits further study.\nSince the gauge theories proposed in the paper are intimately related to supermembranes through dimensional reduction, it is only natural to ask if there is a natural gravity\ntheory that they might be dual to. The sixteen supercharge three dimensional Yang-Mills\nis naturally related to M2 and D2 brane dynamics. As far as the theory in a flat spacetime\nis considered, there has been considerable recent progress related to the understanding the\nconformal M2 brane worldvolume theory. For the special case of the SU (2) gauge theory,\nthe work of Bagger, Lambert and Gustavsson[29, 30] presents a concrete proposal for an effective theory for the IR dynamics of the gauge theory. A more general class of N = 6 three\ndimensional conformal field theories and their string duals have also been proposed in[31].\nIt is natural to expect that the underlying membrane theories admit mass-deformations as\nwell. For the particular case of the M2 brane theory, a supersymmetry preserving massdeformation was indeed worked out in [32, 33]. This begs the question if it is possible to\nconstruct Yang-Mills theories that might be related to massive membrane backgrounds in\nthe strong coupling limit. Mass deformations of the D2 brane theories by the addition of\nChern-Simons interactions to N = 8 SYM on R \u00d7 S 2 was already considered in [28]. See\nalso[34] for a related approach towards mass-deformations. It would be extremely interesting if the particular deformation of the sixteen supercharge theory proposed in the paper\ncan be understood in a natural manner as a deformation of the D2-brane theory.\nAcknowledgements: We are indebted to Niklas Beisert, Dimitra Karabali, Prem Kumar, Tristan McLoughlin, V.
