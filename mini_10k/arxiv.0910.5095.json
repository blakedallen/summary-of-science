Below we write down the\neffective Lagrangian of beta decay. In doing so, we use modern notations and rely on the (V \u2212 A) structure of currents [1]:\nGF\nLeff = \u221a (p\u0304\u03b3\u03bc (1 + \u03b1\u03b35 )n) (\u0113\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bd) .\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nSince every fermion field has mass dimension 3/2 (which follows from power counting in Dirac Lagrangian), the prefactor\nGF has clearly a mass dimension \u22122. From the neutron decay width and angular distribution, one obtains \u03b1 \u2243 \u22121.2 and\n\u22121/2\nthe 'Fermi scale' GF\n\u2243 300 GeV. Particle physics has gone through a dramatic evolution since the time of Fermi [2].\nThe success of the Yang-Mills theory revolutionized the whole scenario [3]. The charged W \u00b1 boson was eventually\npredicted by the Standard Model (SM) [4] having a mass of around 80 GeV, which was later experimentally confirmed by\ndirect detection by the UA1 collaboration at CERN. This W \u00b1 boson induces radioactivity by mediating the beta decay\nprocess. However, a full understanding of the dynamics that controls the Fermi scale and hence the W boson mass\nstill remains an enigma. This is the scale of electroweak phase transition, and understanding the origin of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking (EWSB) constitutes the primary goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The readers are\nstrongly recommended to follow Refs. [5\u201310] to have a broad overview of different possible EWSB mechanisms.\nThe SM reigns supreme at the electroweak scale. But it cannot account for a few experimentally established facts:\nneutrino mass, dark matter and the right amount of baryon asymmetry of the universe. Any viable scenario beyond the\nSM that is expected to trigger EWSB and to answer one or more of the above questions must pass the strict constraints\nimposed by the electroweak precision tests (EWPT) carried out mainly at the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider at\nCERN. Non-abelian gauge theory as the theory for weak interaction has been established to a very good accuracy: (i) the\nZW W and \u03b3W W vertices have been measured to a per cent accuracy at LEP-2 implying that the SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge\ntheory is unbroken at the vertices, (ii) accurate measurements of the Z and W masses have indicated that gauge symmetry\nis broken in masses. Precision measurements at LEP have shown that the \u03c1-parameter (introduced in section 3.6.4) is\nunity to a very good accuracy. This attests the 'SU(2)-doublet' nature of the scalar employed in the SM for spontaneous\nelectroweak breaking. Any acceptable new physics scenario should be in accord with the above observations. CMS and\nATLAS are the two general purpose detectors of the LHC which are expected to answer a lot of such questions by hunting\nnot only the Higgs but also any possible ruler of the terra-electron-volt (TeV) regime.\nThe primary concern is the following: Is the Higgs mechanism as portrayed in the SM a complete story? Bluntly\nspeaking, nobody believes so! Then, what is the nature of the more fundamental underlying dynamics? A more pointed\nquestion is \u2013 if the Higgs exists, is it elementary or composite? The advantage of working with an elementary Higgs,\nas in the SM, is that the two issues of generating gauge boson masses and fermion masses are solved in one stroke.\nAlso, as it turned out, a theory relying on elementary Higgs is perfectly comfortable with EWPT. The disadvantage is\nthat the Higgs mass receives quadratically divergent quantum correction which inevitably calls for new physics, e.g.\nsupersymmetry, to solve the hierarchy problem by taming the unruly quantum behavior. On the other hand, when the\nHiggs is a composite object, e.g. in Technicolor, the hierarchy problem is not there any way because the composite\nHiggs dissolves at the scale where new heavy fermions (e.g. technifermions) condense to break EWSB. But a major\ndisadvantage of Technicolor is that such models, in general, inflict unacceptably large flavor changing neutral currents\n(FCNC) and induce large contributions to the oblique electroweak parameters T (or \u2206\u03c1) and S. Although the FCNC\nproblem can be evaded by going to some more complicated versions of technicolor models, general inconsistency with\nEWPT in the post-LEP era have put technicolor far behind supersymmetry in terms of acceptability. But the idea of\nTechnicolor was too elegant to die. It simply went into slumber only to reappear some years later in a different guise\nthrough the AdS/CFT correspondence [11] as dual to some extra dimensional theories. Many modern nonsupersymmetric\nideas, which we shall discuss in this review, are reminiscent of technicolor, but sufficiently advanced and equipped over\nthe traditional versions to meet the FCNC and EWPT challenges. At this point it is fair to say that supersymmetry and\n\n2\n\n\fthe new Avatars of technicolor/compositeness are the two most attractive general classes of theories that may dictate the\nEWSB mechanism and are expected to be observed at the LHC. Therefore, before we get going into a systematic but\nincremental elaboration of how the idea of EWSB evolved and how the different concerns at different stages were sorted\nout, we briefly touch upon the main features of two most important conceptual pillars on which many specific models\nwere built, namely, supersymmetry and technicolor.\n\n1.1 Supersymmetry\nSupersymmetry is arguably the most favorite extension of physics beyond the Standard Model. It all started more than\n30 years ago from theoretical works pursued independently by Golfand and Likhtman [12], Volkov and Akulov [13], and\nWess and Zumino [14]. For historical developments of the idea of supersymmetry and subsequent model building and\nphenomenology, we recommend the text books [15] and reviews [16, 17]. We briefly outline the concept below.\nSupersymmetry is a new space-time symmetry interchanging bosons and fermions, relating states of different spin.\nWe first recall that Poincar\u00e9 group is a semi-direct product of translations and the Lorentz transformations (which involve rotations and boosts), while a super-Poincar\u00e9 group additionally includes supersymmetry transformations linking\nbosons and fermions. More specifically, the Poincar\u00e9 group is generalized to the super-Poincar\u00e9 group by adding two\nanticommuting generators Q and Q\u0304, to the existing p (linear momentum), J (angular momentum) and K (boost), such\nthat {Q, Q\u0304} \u223c \u03b3 \u03bc p\u03bc . Haag, Lopuszanski and Sohnius generalized the work of O'Raifeartaigh and by Coleman and\nMandula to show that the most general symmetries of the S-matrix are a direct product of super-Poincar\u00e9 group with the\ninternal symmetry group. Since the new symmetry generators linking bosons and fermions are spinors, not scalars, supersymmetry is not an internal symmetry. Years ago, Dirac postulated a doubling of states by introducing an antiparticle\nto every particle in an attempt to reconcile Special Relativity with Quantum Mechanics. In Stern-Gerlach experiment,\nan atomic beam in an inhomogeneous magnetic field splits due to doubling of the number of electron states into spin-up\nand -down modes indicating a doubling with respect to angular momentum. So it is no surprise that Q causes a further\nQ\nsplitting into particle and superparticle (f \u2192 f, fe) [18]. Since Q is spinorial, the superpartners differ from their SM\npartners in spin. The superpartners of fermions are scalars and are called 'sfermions', while the superpartners of gauge\nbosons are fermions and are called 'gauginos'. Put together, a particle and its superpartner form a supermultiplet. The two\nirreducible supermultiplets which are used to construct the supersymmetric standard model are the 'chiral' and the 'vector' supermultiplets. The chiral supermultiplet contains a scalar (e.g. selectron) and a 2-component Weyl fermion (e.g.\nleft-chiral electron). The vector supermultiplet contains a gauge field (e.g. photon) and a 2-component Majorana fermion\n(e.g. photino). We should remember that (i) there is an equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in a\nsupermultiplet; (ii) since p2 commutes with Q, the bosons and fermions in a supermultiplet have the same mass.\n\nBut, why don't we see the superpartners? According to supersymmetry every fermion should have a bosonic partner and\nvice versa. Then the superpartner of electron which is a scalar with the same mass as that of the electron should have been\nfound. This simply means that supersymmetry is not only broken but very badly broken and the superpartners are heavy\nenough to have escaped detection so far. There are quite a few ideas as to how supersymmetry is broken. Supersymmetry\nbreaking can be mediated by supergravity, or by gauge interactions, or superconformal anomaly, and so on. Although\nwe do not know exactly how it is broken, we know very well how to parametrize this breaking. Recall that the SM has\n18 parameters, but the minimal supersymmetric standard model contains 106 additional parameters (see Table 1.1 for the\nparticle content). But once we assume a particular mechanism of supersymmetry breaking many of these parameters will\nbe related. The next question is how long the superparticles can hide themselves? How good is the chance of finding them\nat the LHC? In other words, is there a reason of expecting them to appear at the TeV scale. An interesting observation\nis that the gauge couplings measured at LEP do not unify at a high scale when extrapolated using renormalization group\n(RG) equations containing beta functions computed with the SM particle content. But if we use supersymmetric RG\nequations, i.e. with beta functions computed with the supersymmetric particle content, the couplings do unify at a high\n(grand unification) scale (MGUT ) provided that the superparticle masses lie in the 100 GeV \u2212 10 TeV range.

A very attractive property of all supersymmetric models with\nconserved R-parity is that they all include a stable electrically and color neutral massive (\u223c 100 GeV) particle which\ncould be an excellent candidate of the observed dark matter of the Universe. In case R-parity is violated, even gravitino\ncould make a reasonable dark matter candidate. Furthermore, supersymmetry provides a framework to turn on gravity, as\nwhen global supersymmetry is promoted to a local one we get supergravity. Supersymmetric theories have adapted very\nwell with the LEP data, because they are decoupling theories in the sense that superparticle induced loop corrections to\nelectroweak observables, in general, rapidly decouple with increasing superparticle masses.\nSupersymmetry provides an important prediction on the Higgs mass. In the minimal (two-Higgs doublet) supersymmetric standard model the lightest Higgs cannnot be heavier than about 135 GeV or so provided the superparticles weigh\naround a TeV. If we do not find any Higgs within that limit, the minimal version will be seriously disfavored. We have\ndiscussed in detail the properties of both neutral and charged scalars of the supersymmetric Higgs sector in section 6.3.\nBut in this review we refrain from discussing their collider search strategies - for detailed search studies see Djouadi's\nreview in [17].\n\n1.2 Technicolor\nHere we present an outline of the main idea behind technicolor theories. For a detailed survey of the historical development and the evolution of different concepts of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking (DWSB) the readers are\nrecommended to go through the early papers of Susskind [19] and Weinberg [20] and consult the reviews on DWSB\nbreaking and technicolor [21\u201323]. We also recommend the readers to subsequently follow two recent articles on Higgs as\na pseudo-Goldstone boson which discuss from a modern perspective as to how the difficulties of traditional technicolor\nmodels are overcome [24, 25].\n\n4\n\n\fQCD provides a strong force that binds the colored quarks. Can it induce EWSB by creating a bound state of strongly\ninteracting sector which receives a non-zero expectation value in the vacuum? This is the central theme of technicolor\n(TC). Let us for the moment consider only SU(3)C interaction and switch off the electroweak gauge force of the SM.\nLet us assume only one generation of massless quark doublet, both left-handed and right-handed: QL = (u, d)TL and\nQR = (u, d)TR . The QCD Lagrangian is invariant under a global chiral symmetry\nSU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R .\nThe symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the diagonal subgroup SU(2)L+R , which corresponds to isospin symmetry, when\n \u0304 vac 6= 0 .\nh\u016buivac = hddi\nThis chiral symmetry breaking is accompanied by three massless pseudoscalars which are identified with the pions. These\nare associated with three axial currents (q \u2261 (u, d)T )\n\u03bc\njAa\n= f\u03c0 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c0a = q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5\n\n\u03c4a\nq,\n2\n\nwhere \u03c4 a are the three Pauli matrices (a = 1, 2, 3) and f\u03c0 is the pion decay constant. When the electroweak interaction is\nswitched on, the massless pions are eaten up by the as yet massless gauge bosons to form the longitudinal components of\nthose gauge bosons which in turn become massive. The W and Z boson masses are given by\np\nMW = gf\u03c0\u00b1 /2 , MZ = g 2 + g \u20322 f\u03c00 /2 .\n\nIsospin symmetry guarantees that f\u03c0 \u2261 f\u03c0\u00b1 = f\u03c00 . This picture is not phenomenologically acceptable as by putting\nf\u03c0 \u223c 93 MeV, we obtain MW \u223c 30 MeV, while in reality MW \u223c 80 GeV. So the QCD force of the SM is not\nstrong enough to generate the correct EWSB scale. TC does precisely this job. It is a scaled-up version of QCD, where\nf\u03c0 \u2192 F\u03c0 \u223c v \u2248 246 GeV. So the W and Z bosons do not eat up the ordinary pions but the technipions. The beauty of\nthis theory is that the hierarchy problem is solved by dimensional transmutation. Recalling that the QCD beta function is\nnegative (\u03b2 < 0), the electroweak scale (v) is dynamically generated when the TC gauge coupling gT C diverges in the\ninfrared, in complete analogy with the dynamical generation of \u039bQCD :\n\u03b2 3\ndgTC (\u03bc)\ng (\u03bc) \u21d2 v = MPl exp\n=\nd ln \u03bc\n16\u03c0 2 TC\n\n\u0012\n\n8\u03c0 2 /\u03b2\ngT2 C (MPl )\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nThe next important question is how fermion masses are generated [26]. Let us consider an example by enlarging the TC\ngroup GT C to an extended technicolor (ETC) group GET C in which both SU(3)C and GT C are embedded:\nGET C \u2283 SU(3)C \u00d7 GT C .\nIt is assumed that GET C is spontaneously broken at a scale \u039bET C . The gauge bosons corresponding to broken ETC\ngenerators would connect ordinary quarks (q) which transform under SU(3)C to the TC quarks (\u03a8T C ) which transform\nunder GT C , and would generate effective four-fermion operators (after appropriate Fierz transformations)\n2\n\u0001\ngET\nC\n(q\u0304q) \u03a8\u0304T C \u03a8T C .\n2\n\u039bET C\n\nAt a lower scale \u039bT C , a condensation takes place: h\u03a8\u0304T C \u03a8T C i \u223c \u039b3T C \u223c F\u03c03 \u223c v 3 . This immediately generates the\nordinary quark mass\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u039bT C\n.\nmq \u223c \u039b T C\n\u039bET C\n\n5\n\n\fTo generate the mass hierarchy among ordinary quarks, one has to first put all those ordinary quarks in a single ETC\nmultiplet and arrange to break the multiplet through different cascades, thus generating different scales. But the exchanges\nof the same ETC gauge fields also generate operators with four ordinary quarks, namely, (q\u0304q)2 /\u039b2ET C , which severely\nviolate flavor and CP particularly because all those SM quarks are in the same multiplet. Data on K and B mixing as well\nas rare meson decays put a very strong constraint: \u039bET C > 103\u22125 TeV, which is at least two to four orders of magnitude\nlarger than the value of \u039bET C required to predict the correct strange quark mass. How to resolve this tension between\nlarge enough quark mass vis-\u00e0-vis too large FCNC rates? Here comes the r\u00f4le of walking technicolor [27]. Without going\n\u0001\ninto the detailed discussion, we just point out that the dimension of the operator (q\u0304q) \u03a8\u0304T C \u03a8T C could be (6+\u03b3), instead\nof the classical value 6, where \u03b3 is the anomalous dimension generated by the TC group. The TC coupling gT C may have\na large fixed point value at \u03bc \u223c \u039bT C and its evolution above \u039bT C may be slow (hence, 'walking', instead of 'running').\nThe formula for the ordinary quark mass is then modified to\nmq \u223c \u039b T C\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039bT C\n\u039bET C\n\n\u0013(2+\u03b3)\n\n.\n\nIf \u03b3 is large and negative, then for a given mq , one can accommodate a larger \u039bET C than when \u03b3 = 0, i.e. one can have a\nlarge \u039bET C without suppressing the quark mass. On the other hand, the suppression of FCNC rates still goes as 1/\u039b2ET C\nsince the SM color group cannot generate any large anomalous dimension. This way the quark mass vs FCNC tension is\nconsiderably ameliorated in the walking technicolor scenario.\nWe conclude our discussion on technicolor by just mentioning the idea of top quark condensates. Although Nambu\nfirst postulated it, Bardeen, Hill and Lindner formulated the theory of dynamical breaking of electroweak theory in the\nSM by a top quark condensate [28]. Here the Higgs boson is a t\u0304t bound state. Essentially, one implements the BCS\nor Nambu\u2212Jona-Lasinio mechanism in which a new interaction at a high scale \u039b triggers a low energy condensate htt\u0304i.\nGenerically, top quark mass turns out to be somewhat larger than the presently known value. This minimal scheme was\nfurther extended by Hill in a specific topcolor scheme [29]. In a subsequent development it was shown that in an ETC\ntheory, where it is hard to generate a large top quark mass without adversely affecting the \u03c1 parameter, a substantial part\nof the top quark mass may be generated by additionally incorporating the topcolor dynamics [30].\n\n1.3 Plan of the review\nWe shall start our discussion with a brief recapitulation of the idea of gauge invariance. In the subsequent sections, we\nshall briefly review the essential structure of the electroweak part of the SM, illustrate the Higgs mechanism and raise the\nissue of the quantum instability of the scalar potential. We shall then demonstrate how the quadratic divergence is tamed\nin a toy scenario reminiscent of a supersymmetric model. Then we go on to explore different avenues through which one\ncan successfully realize electroweak phase transition. In the process, we shall discuss minimal supersymmetry (only the\nHiggs sector), and some relatively recent ideas like little Higgs, gauge-Higgs unification and Higgsless scenarios. The\nlatter two scenarios explicitly rely on the existence of extra dimension with a TeV-size inverse radius of compactification.\nIt should be noted that many of these non-supersymmetric scenarios are often reminiscent of the technicolor models from\nthe standpoint of AdS/CFT correspondence, which we shall just mention in passing without actually going into the details\nof this correspondence. For each of these modern nonsupersymmetric scenarios, we shall first illustrate the basic concepts\nusing simple toy models, and then discuss, without going into calculational details, their phenomenological features and\nthe strategies for detecting their signatures at the LHC. Finally, we shall conclude with a brief stock-taking of different\naspects that the model-builders should keep in mind, followed by a short discussion on how to distinguish apart the\ndifferent EWSB models at the LHC.\n\n6\n\n\f2 A short recap of the idea of gauge invariance\nThis is a brief survey of the idea of gauge invariance required to formulate the basic structure of the SM. Let us first\nconsider QED, which is governed by a U(1) gauge symmetry. We start with the Lagrangian of the electron field \u03c8(x) with\na mass m,\nL\n\n=\n\n\u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 \u2212 m)\u03c8,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03b1 \u2261 \u2202x\u2202 \u03b1 . Observe that for \u03c8(x) \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 (x) = ei\u039b \u03c8(x), where \u039b = real constant, the Lagrangian remains\nunaltered: L(\u03c8) = L(\u03c8 \u2032 ). Various transformations of the group U(1) commute. Such groups are called 'abelian'. Since\n\u039b is a constant, the group is also called 'global'.\nNow suppose that the group is still U(1), but 'local', i.e., \u039b \u2261 \u039b(x). Then \u03c8 \u2032 (x) = ei\u039b(x) \u03c8(x) \u2261 U (x)\u03c8(x). Let us\nsee how the derivative \u2202\u03b1 \u03c8(x) transform.\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03c8(x)\n\n= \u2202\u03b1 U \u22121 (x)\u03c8 \u2032 (x) = U \u22121 (x) U (x)\u2202\u03b1 U \u22121 (x) \u03c8 \u2032 (x)\n{z\n}\n|\n\u001a\n(1 + i\u039b)\u2202\u03b1 (1 \u2212 i\u039b)\u03c8 \u2032 (x)\n= U \u22121 (\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b1 \u039b(x))\u03c8 \u2032 (x) .\n= (\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b1 \u039b(x))\u03c8 \u2032 (x)\n\n(2.2)\n\nAlthough for illustration we used infinitesimal transformation, it is actually not a necessary condition. Note that in the\nfirst term in RHS the derivative acts on everything on its right, but in the end where we obtain (\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03b1 \u039b(x))\u03c8 \u2032 (x),\nthe second \u2202\u03b1 acts only on \u039b(x) and not on \u03c8 \u2032 (x). The message is the following: although \u03c8(x) = U \u22121 (x)\u03c8 \u2032 (x),\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03c8(x) 6= U \u22121 (x)\u2202\u03b1 \u03c8 \u2032 (x), i.e., the field and its derivative do not transform the same way under a local transformation.\nFor the global case, if we recall, they did transform in the same way, and the Lagrangian remained invariant. But now for\nthe local case, L (\u03c8) 6= L (\u03c8 \u2032 ).\nNow, we write the Lagrangian in Eq. (2.1) with D\u03b1 \u2261 \u2202\u03b1 \u2212 ieA\u03b1 (x) instead of \u2202\u03b1 , where e is a coupling constant. D\u03b1\nis called the covariant derivative. We now observe the following:\n[\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 ieA\u03b1 (x)]\u03c8(x)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nwhere\n\nU \u22121 U (x)[\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 ieA\u03b1 (x)]U \u22121 (x)\u03c8 \u2032 (x)\n\nU \u22121 (x)[U (x)\u2202\u03b1 U \u22121 (x) \u2212 ieU (x)A\u03b1 (x)U \u22121 (x)]\u03c8 \u2032 (x)\n\nU \u22121 (x)[\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b1 \u039b(x) \u2212 ieA\u03b1 (x)]\u03c8 \u2032 (x)\n\nU\n\n\u22121\n\n(x)[\u2202\u03b1 \u2212\n\n(2.3)\n\nieA\u2032\u03b1 (x)]\u03c8 \u2032 (x),\n\n1\nA\u2032\u03b1 \u2261 A\u03b1 (x) + \u2202\u03b1 \u039b(x).\ne\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe observe that the covariant derivative transforms like the field itself: D\u03b1 \u03c8(x) = U \u22121 (x)D\u03b1\u2032 \u03c8 \u2032 (x), where D\u03b1\u2032 \u2261\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 ieA\u2032\u03b1 (x). This ensures that L of Eq. (2.1), after replacing \u2202\u03b1 by D\u03b1 , is invariant under the gauge transformation.\nThe gauge field strength tensor is defined as F\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2202\u03b1 A\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03b2 A\u03b1 . Under gauge transformation\n1\n1\n\u2032\nF\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u2202\u03b1 (A\u03b2 + \u2202\u03b2 \u039b) \u2212 \u2202\u03b2 (A\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b1 \u039b) = F\u03b1\u03b2 .\ne\ne\n\n7\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fThe kinetic term of gauge field is given by Lkin = \u2212 14 F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 . One can also write F\u03b1\u03b2 = 1e [D\u03b1 , D\u03b2 ]. It is instructive\nto check that in terms of the electric and magnetic field components,\n\nF \u03bc\u03bd\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec E1\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed E2\nE3\n\n\u2212E1\n0\nB3\n\u2212B2\n\n\u2212E2\n\u2212B3\n0\nB1\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2212E3\nB2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\u2212B1 \uf8f8\n0\n\n(2.6)\n\n~2 \u2212 B\n~ 2 ), which is the kinetic term.\nIt follows immediately that \u2212 41 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd = 12 (E\nLet us now concentrate on the non-abelian group SU(2). Consider a fermion field \u03c8(x) which transforms as a doublet\n\u0013\n\u0012 1\n\u03c4a\n\u03c8 (x)\n. Let us follow its local SU(2) transformation : \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 = ei 2 \u039ba (x) \u03c8(x), and\nunder SU(2): \u03c8(x) =\n2\n\u03c8 (x)\n\u03c4a\n\u03c8\u0304 \u2192 \u03c8\u0304 \u2032 = \u03c8\u0304(x)e\u2212i 2 \u039ba (x) , where \u03c4a (a = 1, 2, 3) are the Pauli matrices which satisfy [\u03c4a , \u03c4b ] = 2i\u01ebabc \u03c4c . It is easy to\ncheck that \u2202\u03b1 \u03c8(x) = U \u22121 (x)[\u2202\u03b1 \u2212 i \u03c42a \u2202\u03b1 \u039ba (x)]\u03c8 \u2032 (x), i.e. \u03c8(x) and \u2202\u03b1 \u03c8(x) do not transform identically, and hence\nthe Lagrangian is not invariant under SU(2) transformation. To ensure gauge invariance we must start with the covariant\n\u0003\n\u0002\nderivative D\u03b1 \u03c8(x) \u2261 \u2202\u03b1 \u2212 ig \u03c42a Aa\u03b1 (x) \u03c8(x), where g is the coupling constant (like the symbol e used for U(1)).

We must redefine field the strength tensor in the non-abelian case as\na\nF\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2261 (\u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03b2 Aa\u03b1 ) + g\u01ebabc A\u03b1b A\u03b2c .\n\n(2.9)\n\na\nIt is instructive to use the transformation properties of the gauge fields, discussed above, to check that F\u03b1\u03b2\nFa\u03b1\u03b2 remains\ninvariant under gauge transformation, and constitutes the gauge boson kinetic term in the Lagrangian.\n\n3 The Standard Model Higgs mechanism\nNow we will discuss the idea and implementation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB). Whenever a system does not\nshow all the symmetries by which it is governed, we say that the symmetry is 'spontaneously' broken. More explicitly,\nwhen there is a solution which does not exhibit a given symmetry which is encoded and respected in the Lagrangian,\nor Hamiltonian, or the equations of motion, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken. In the context of the\nSM, the SSB idea is used to generate gauge boson masses without spoiling the calculability (which we technically call\nrenormalisability) of the theory. To gain insight into different aspects of SSB, we will consider different cases one by one.\n\n8\n\n\f3.1 SSB of discrete symmetry\nConsider a real scalar field \u03c6(x). The Hamiltonian is given by\nH\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n1 2 1\n~ \u03c6 2 + V (\u03c6),\n\u25bd\n\u03c6\u0307 +\n2\n2\n\nwhere V (\u03c6) =\n\n1 2 2 1 2 4\nm \u03c6 + \u03bb \u03c6 .\n2\n4\n\n(3.1)\n\nAbove, we have assumed a \u03c6 \u2194 \u2212\u03c6 discrete symmetry which prohibits odd powers of \u03c6. Clearly, the minimum of V (\u03c6)\nis at \u03c6 = 0. Now, as the next step, consider\nV (\u03c6)\n\n= \u2212 21 m2 \u03c62 + 14 \u03bb2 \u03c64 , where m2 > 0.\n\n(3.2)\n\nSince V \u2032 (\u03c6)|\u03c6=0 = 0, it follows that \u03c6 = 0 is indeed an extremum. Moreover,\nV \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6)|\u03c6=0 = \u2212m2 implies that \u03c6 = 0 is rather a maximum and not a minimum.\n\u0001\nm\nm4\nStable minima occur at two points \u03c6 = \u00b1 m\n\u03bb , where V\n\u03bb = \u2212 4\u03bb2 . Recall, we\ncan always add a constant term in V (\u03c6), which does not change physics. Using\nthis idea, we can write the potential as a complete square as\nV (\u03c6)\n\n=\n\n1 2 2\n\u03bb (\u03c6 \u2212 v 2 )2 ,\n4\n\n(3.3)\n\nFigure 1: The Mexican hat potential.\nwhere v = m\n\u03bb . With this redefined potential, the system can be at either of the\ntwo minima (\u00b1v). Once one solution is chosen, the symmetry breaks spontaneously. Note, the potential V (\u03c6) attains its\nminimum value zero for a nonzero value of \u03c6. The zero energy state, characterized by V (\u03c6) = 0, is called the ground\nstate or the minimum energy state, while v \u2261 h0|\u03c6|0i is called the 'vacuum expectation value (vev)'.\nWe should remember two points:\n\u2022 When we consider the vev of a field, this field has to be a 'classical' field. Remember, a quantum field can always\nbe expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators whose vacuum expectation would always vanish.\n\u2022 When we write v \u2261 h0|\u03c6(x)|0i, a na\u0131\u0308ve question comes to mind as to how the LHS is independent of x while the\nRHS is a function of x. It happens because the translational invariance of the vacuum can be used to write:\nh0|\u03c6(x)|0i = h0|eipx \u03c6(0)e\u2212ipx |0i = h0|\u03c6|0i = v.\n\n3.2\n\nSSB of global U(1) symmetry\n\nFor U(1) symmetry, we must start with a complex scalar field \u03c6. The scalar potential is given by\nV (|\u03c6|)\n\n=\n\n1 2\n1\n\u03bb (|\u03c6|2 \u2212 v 2 )2 .\n2\n2\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis potential has a global U(1) symmetry: \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6\u2032 = \u221a\nei\u03b1 \u03c6, where \u03b1 is any real constant. The potential is minimum\n(which is zero) at all points on the orbit of radius |\u03c6| = v/ 2, different points corresponding to different values of Arg(\u03c6).\nThe shape of the potential takes the form of a 'Mexican hat' \u2013 see Fig. 1. We write\n1\n\u03c6(x) = \u221a (v + \u03c7(x) + i\u03c8(x)) ,\n2\n\n9\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fwhere \u03c7(x) and \u03c8(x) are the two components of the complex quantum field around the stable minima. The Lagrangian\nin terms of the \u03c7 and \u03c8 fields can be expressed as\n\u0014\n\u00152\n\u00032\n1 2 1\n1 2\n1 \u0002\n2\nL =K\u2212 \u03bb\n|v + \u03c7 + i\u03c8| \u2212 v\n= K \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03c72 + 2v\u03c7 + \u03c8 2 ,\n2\n2\n2\n8\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere K = 12 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c7)2 + 21 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8)2 is the kinetic term. It is clear from Eq. (3.6) that the component of excitation along\nthe v-direction (\u03c7) acquires a mass (m\u03c7 = \u03bbv), while the component (\u03c8), which is in a direction tangential to the orbit,\nremains massless (m\u03c8 = 0). That \u03c8 is massless is not surprising as traversing along the orbit does not cost any energy.\nWhat is important is that as a result of a spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry, a massless scalar has\nbeen generated. Such a massless scalar field is called the 'Nambu-Goldstone boson', or often the 'Goldstone boson'.\n\n3.3 SSB of global SU(2) symmetry\nHere, the complex scalar field is a doublet of SU(2), given by \u03a6 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6+\n\u03c60\n\n\u0013\n. The Lagrangian is given by\n\nL = (\u2202\u03bc \u03a6)\u2020 (\u2202\u03bc \u03a6) \u2212 V (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6) ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 = \u03c6\u2217+ \u03c6+ + \u03c6\u22170 \u03c60 . Here \u03c6+ and \u03c60 have 2 real components each, i.e. there are in total 4 degrees of freedom\n(d.o.f.). At this level, the subscripts + and 0 are simply labels. We will see later on that these labels would correspond to\nelectric charge +1 and 0, respectively. After SSB, 3 d.o.f. remain massless, one becomes massive. It can be proved that\nthe number of Goldstone bosons is the number of broken generators. To appreciate this from a geometric point of view,\nnote that a 4d sphere has 3 tangential directions, and clearly, quantum oscillations along these directions yield massless\nmodes.\nOf course, the next question is \u2013 what happens when a global symmetry is gauged?\n\n3.4 SSB with local U(1) symmetry\nNow we deal with a local U(1) symmetry. The Lagrangian can be written as\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1 2\nv2\n1\n2\nL = |D\u03bc \u03a6| \u2212 \u03bb |\u03a6| \u2212\n\u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n2\n4\n2\n\n(3.8)\n\nHere we have used a slightly different notation compared to the global U(1) case. The complex scalar will be denoted\nby \u03a6, which can be written as \u03a6(x) = \u03c6(x)ei\u03b8(x) where \u03c6(x) and \u03b8(x) are the two real d.o.f. Recall that the covariant\nderivative and the gauge field strength tensors are given by\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc , F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc .\nNow, under gauge transformation \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u2032 = ei\u03b1(x) \u03a6 and the Lagrangian still remains invariant. This phase \u03b1(x) is\ndifferent at different space-time points, but it is not a physical parameter and at each and every such point one has the\nliberty to choose it in such a way that it precisely cancels the \u03b8(x) at that point. This choice of gauge is called unitary\ngauge. In other words, \u03a6(x) can be chosen to be real everywhere, and can be written, without any loss of generality, as\n1\n\u03a6(x) = \u03c6(x) = \u221a (v + \u03c7(x)).\n2\n\n10\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fThe Lagrangian takes the following form:\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1\n1\n\u03bb2 1\n(v + \u03c7(x))2 \u2212 v 2 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd\n2 2\n2\n4\n\u0001 \u03bb2\n1\ne2\n1\n2\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c7(x))2 + A\u03bc A\u03bd v 2 + 2v\u03c7(x) + \u03c72 (x) \u2212\n(2v + \u03c7(x)) \u03c72 (x) \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n2\n8\n4\n\n= |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc )\u03c6(x)|2 \u2212\n\nL\n\n=\n\n(3.10)\n\nThis describes a real scalar field \u03c7(x) with mass \u03bbv and a massive vector field A\u03bc with a mass ev. Note that SSB\nresulted in a redistribution of fields: one of the two real fields forming the complex scalar has been gauged away but it\nhas reappeared in the form of longitudinal component of the vector field A\u03bc . The total number of d.o.f. thus remains\nunaltered: 2+2=3+1. The Goldstone boson is eaten up by the gauge boson. This is called the Higgs mechanism and \u03c7(x)\nis called the Higgs field1 .\n\n3.5 SSB with local SU(2) symmetry\nDenoting the complex scalar doublet as \u03a6, the Lagrangian can be written as\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\n1\n1 a a\nL = |D\u03bc \u03a6|2 \u2212 \u03bb2 |\u03a6|2 \u2212 v 2 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n2\n4\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere\n\u03a6\nD\u03bc \u03a6\n\n\u0012\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n=\n\n\u03c6+\n\u03c60\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n= \u221a\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c61 + i\u03c62\n\u03c63 + i\u03c64\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(3.12)\n\n\u0013\nig a a\na\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 W\u03bc \u03a6 , F\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2202\u03bc W\u03bda \u2212 \u2202\u03bd W\u03bca + g\u01ebabc W\u03bcb W\u03bdc (a, b = 1, 2, 3).\n2\n\n(3.13)\n\na\nNote that the definition of the field strength tensor F\u03bc\u03bd\nfollows from Eq. (2.9). Here, |\u03a6|2 = \u03c6\u2217+ \u03c6+ + \u03c6\u22170 \u03c60 = 12 (\u03c621 +\nP 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c62 + \u03c63 + \u03c64 ). The potential is minimum when i \u03c6i = v 2 , where v is the radius of the orbit. Without any loss\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n. The Higgs field\nof generality we can assume that the entire vev is in the \u03c63 direction, i.e., h\u03a6i = \u03a60 = \u221a12\nv\nh(x) is the real excitation around the vev. Thus, in the unitary gauge where the scalar field has only the real component,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n1\n\u03a6(x) = \u221a2\n.\nv + h(x)\n\nThe gauge boson masses arise from the expansion of |D\u03bc \u03a6|2 -piece of the Lagrangian. This gives\ng2 a a\n\u03c4 W\u03bc\n8\n\n\u0012\n\n0\nv\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\n=\n\ng2\n8\n\n\u0012\n\nW\u03bc3\n1\nW\u03bc + iW\u03bc2\n\nW\u03bc1 \u2212 iW\u03bc2\n\u2212W\u03bc3\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n0\nv\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\u0010 gv \u00112\n2\n\nW\u03bc+ W\u03bc\u2212 +\n\n1 \u0010 gv \u00112 3 3\nW\u03bc W\u03bc ,\n2 2\n\n\u221a\nwhere W \u00b1 \u2261 (W\u03bc1 \u2213 iW\u03bc2 ) 2. This means that all the three gauge bosons have the same mass (gv/2). The equality of\nW \u00b1 and W 3 masses does not follow from gauge symmetry but results from a global 'custodial' symmetry. What is this\ncustodial symmetry? Looking at the orbit structure, \u03c621 + \u03c622 + \u03c623 + \u03c624 = v 2 , we note that before the SSB the potential\nhad a SO(4) symmetry, which is reduced to SO(3) once one direction is fixed for the vev. The group SO(3) is isomorphic\nto SU(2). This SU(2) is global and should not be confused with the SU(2) we gauged. It is this SU(2) that we call the\ncustodial SU(2). This remains unbroken even after the vev is generated, and this unbroken symmetry enforces the equality\n1 The basic idea of Higgs mechanism was borrowed from condensed matter physics. Similar things happen in the BCS theory of superconductivity.\nElectromagnetic gauge invariance is spontaneously broken and photon becomes massive inside a superconductor from where magnetic fields are repelled\ndue to Meissner effect. For historical reasons, the mechanism is also known as Anderson-Higgs mechanism, and, Higgs-Brout-Englert-Guralnik-HagenKibble mechanism.\n\n11\n\n\fof the gauge boson masses. The bottom line is that all the three Goldstone bosons related to the global SU(2) have now\ndisappeared, and three massive (but degenerate) gauge bosons have emerged.\n\n3.6\n\nSSB with local SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) symmetry (the Electroweak part of the SM)\n\n3.6.1 Why SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)?\nObviously we need two gauge bosons to meet the observations already made. There has to be a massive charged gauge\nboson which would mediate beta decay. The smallest unitary group which provides an off-diagonal generator (corresponding to the charged gauge boson) is SU(2). The relevant generators are \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 . We further need a massless gauge\nboson. Any association of photon with the neutral generator \u03c4 3 would lead to contradiction with respect to the charge\nassignment of particles. The gauge charges of fermions in a doublet coupling to W 3 are \u00b1 12 , clearly different from the\nelectric charges. Moreover, W 3 couples to neutrino, but photon does not. All in all, just with SU(2) gauge theory we\ncannot explain both weak and electromagnetic interactions. The next simplest construction is to avoid taking a simple\ngroup, but consider SU(2) \u00d7 U(1).\nThe covariant derivative will now contain gauge bosons of both SU(2) and U(1):\nD\u03bc\n\n=\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ig\n\nY\n\u03c4a a\nW\u03bc \u2212 ig \u2032 B\u03bc ,\n2\n2\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere the quantum number Y is the 'hypercharge' of the particle on which D\u03bc acts.\nThe SM contains 5 representations of fermions (quarks and leptons) for each generation \u2013 2 doublets and 3 singlets.\n\u0012\n\nL\u2261\n\n\u03bd\ne\n\n\u0013\n\nL\n\n, eR , Q \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\nu\nd\n\n\u0013\n\n, uR , dR\n\nL\n\n\u03a8L and \u03a8R are left- and right-chiral states of a fermion field \u03a8, such that \u03b35 \u03a8L = \u2212\u03a8L and \u03b35 \u03a8R = \u03a8R .\n3.6.2 Notion of hypercharge\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03bd\ne\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\n\u0582 t3 = 21 ,\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2234 Q \u2212 t3 = \u2212 21\n\nQ=0\n\n\uf8f8\n\nL\n\nu\nd\n\n\u057f t3 = \u2212 12 , Q = \u22121 \u2234 Q \u2212 t3 = \u2212 21\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u0582 t3 = 21 ,\n\nQ=\n\n2\n3\n\n\u2234 Q \u2212 t3 =\n\n1\n6\n\n\u2234 Q \u2212 t3 =\n\n1\n6\n\n\uf8f8\n\nL\n\n\u057f t3 = \u2212 21 , Q = \u2212 13\n\nNote that the (Q \u2212 t3 ) assignments are same for all members inside a given multiplet, i.e., the generator corresponding\nto (Q \u2212 t3 ) commutes with all the SU(2) generator \u03c4a . Hence, either (Q \u2212 t3 ) or some multiple of it can serve as the\nhypercharge quantum number of U (1)Y . We follow the convention\n2(Q \u2212 t3 ) = Y\n\n=\u21d2\n\n12\n\nQ = t3 +\n\nY\n.\n2\n\n(3.15)\n\n\fIt is instructive to check that the currents satisfy J\u03bcQ = J\u03bc3 + 21 J\u03bcY .\n3.6.3 How is the symmetry broken?\nIf a generator \u00d4 is such that the corresponding operator ei\u00d4 acting on the vacuum |0i cannot change it, i.e. ei\u00d4 |0i = |0i,\nthen obviously the operation corresponds to a symmetry of the vacuum and the corresponding generator kills the vacuum,\ni.e. \u00d4|0i = 0. In the context of gauge theory, when the vacuum is left unbroken by a generator, the gauge boson\ncorresponding to that generator would remain massless. Let us now check how the neutral (diagonal) generators of SU(2)\nand U(1) act on the scalar vev.\nt3 \u03a6 0\nY\n\u03a60\n2\n\n=\n\n\u0013\u0012\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n1 0\n1\n= 2\u221a2\n0 1\n1\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n0\n6= 0 ,\n\u2212v\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n0\n1\n= 2\u221a2\n6= 0 ,\nv\nv\n\n0\nv\n\n=\n\n1\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n\u0012\n\n(3.16)\n\nbut (t3 + Y2 )\u03a60 = 0. This means that Qem = t3 + Y2 is indeed the electromagnetic charge generator and consequently\nphoton is massless. This is the only combination that yields a massless gauge boson, and the massless state is neither a\nSU(2) nor a U(1) state, but a mixed state. In other words, the masslessness of photon is a consequence of the vacuum\nbeing invariant under the operation by eiQem .\n\u2022 An electrically charged field does not acquire any vev, as otherwise charge will be spontaneously broken in the following\nway: If \u03c6+ is the charge (+) field, then one can write [Q, \u03c6+ ] = +\u03c6+ . This means that if h0|\u03c6+ |0i = v 6= 0, then\nusing the commutator relation one can show that Q|0i 6= 0, i.e. electric charge is spontaneously broken!\n\n3.6.4 Masses of the gauge bosons\nThere are four gauge bosons. One of them is the massless photon, but the other three are massive. Here we calculate their\nmasses.

The mass matrix in the (W\u03bc3 , B\u03bc ) basis has zero determinant. This is not unexpected\nas one of the states has to be the massless photon (A). The other eigenstate is the Z boson.

One can easily check that in the g \u2032 \u2192\n0 limit, one recovers the custodial symmetry. Experimentally, MZ = 91.1875 \u00b1 0.0021 GeV and MW = 80.399 \u00b1 0.025\nGeV, which are almost the same values as predicted by the SM. The weak mixing angle is given by sin2 \u03b8W \u2243 0.23.\nWe will here define an important parameter:\n\u03c1\u2261\n\n2\nMW\n.\nMZ2 cos2 \u03b8W\n\n(3.20)\n\nWith the SU(2) doublet scalar representation (and at tree level), one can easily check from the above relations that \u03c1 = 1.\nExperimental measurements on the Z pole at LEP also indicate \u03c1 to be very close to unity within a per mille precision.\n\u2022 If there are several representations of scalars whose electrically neutral members acquire vev's vi , then\n2\nMW\n=\n\u03c1\u2261\nMZ2 cos2 \u03b8W\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nvi2 [Ti (Ti + 1) \u2212\nN\nX\n\n1 2\nYi ]\n4\n\n,\n\n(3.21)\n\n1 2 2\nv Y\n2 i i\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Ti and Yi are the weak isospin and hypercharge of the i-th multiplet. It is easy to check that only those scalars\nare allowed to acquire vevs which satisfy (2T + 1)2 \u2212 3Y 2 = 1, as otherwise \u03c1 = 1 will not be satisfied at the tree\nlevel. The simplest choice is to have a scalar with T = 21 and Y = 1, which corresponds to the SM doublet \u03a6. More\ncomplicated scalar multiplets, e.g. one with T = 3 and Y = 4, also satisfy this relation.\n\n3.6.5 Couplings of photon, Z and W \u00b1 with fermions\na\n\nThe interaction of the gauge bosons with the fermions arise from i\u03a8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc \u03a8, where D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 ig \u03c42 W\u03bca \u2212 ig \u2032 Y2 B\u03bc .\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c81\nIn the SM, a generic fermion field (\u03a8) has a left-chiral SU(2)-doublet representation: \u03a8L =\n, and right-chiral\n\u03c82 L\nSU(2)-singlet representations: \u03c81R and \u03c82R .\nNow we look into the charged-current interaction.

Now rewriting W 3 and B in terms of the photon (A) and the Z boson, as W\u03bc3 = cos \u03b8W Z\u03bc + sin \u03b8W A\u03bc and\nB\u03bc = \u2212 sin \u03b8W Z\u03bc + cos \u03b8W A\u03bc , one can write the neutral current Lagrangian in the (A, Z) basis as\nLN C\n\n=\n\nJ\u03bcQ A\u03bc + J\u03bcZ Z\u03bc , where\n\nJ\u03bcQ\n\n=\n\nJ\u03bcZ\n\n=\n\n(3.25)\neQi \u03c8\u0304i \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8i , with e \u2261 g sin \u03b8W , and sum over i implied,\n\u0003\ng \u0002 i\na \u03c8\u0304i \u03b3\u03bc PL \u03c8i + aiR \u03c8\u0304i \u03b3\u03bc PR \u03c8i , with aiL \u2261 ti3 \u2212 Qi sin2 \u03b8W , aiR \u2261 \u2212Qi sin2 \u03b8W .

The a2 contribution makes a vital\nqualitative and quantitative difference by introducing a term proportional to cos \u03b8.

(4.9)\n=\n2\n3\n3\n3\u03c0 2\nIf the top quark did not exist, i.e. the bottom quark were a SU(2) singlet, its isospin would have been zero. In that\nsituation, by putting tb3 = 0 in the above formula, we would get \u0393b \u2243 23.5 MeV. Even though the lighter quarks could\nnot be well discriminated from one another, bottom tagging was quite efficient thanks to the micro-vertex detector at\nLEP. As a result, \u0393b could be measured with good accuracy and the measurement was very close to the SM value. The\ndiscrepancy (between 376 MeV and 23.5 MeV) was too much to be blamed to radiative corrections! The immediate\nconclusion was that the bottom quark should have a partner, the top quark. But is the bottom an isospin 'minus half'\nor a 'plus half' quark? The measured decay width is consistent with tb3 = \u2212 21 . One could reach the same conclusion\nfrom the measurement of AbFB . If the bottom quark were an SU(2) singlet, its coupling to the Z boson would have\nbeen vector-like and AbFB would have been identically zero. But LEP measured a statistically significant non-vanishing\nasymmetry. Moreover, AbFB is sensitive to ab = tb3 (not a2b ). This way too it was settled that tb3 = \u2212 21 . Thus even\nbefore the top quark was discovered, not only its existence was confirmed but also all its gauge quantum numbers were\ncomprehensibly established by studying how the Z boson couples to the bottom quark. Measurements of electroweak\nradiative effects at LEP further provided some hint of what would be the expected value of the top mass. This will be\ndiscussed in the context of the quantum corrections to the tree level value of the \u03c1 parameter.\n\n17\n\n(4.8)\n\n\f4.3 Main radiative corrections\nThe main radiative corrections relevant at the Z-pole originate from one particle irreducible gauge boson two-point functions.

The terms of our interest are proportional to g\u03bc\u03bd , which we will call\nF . Below, we will write the \u03a0-functions, which are defined as \u03a0(q 2 , m1 , m2 ) = \u2212iX(q 2 , m1 , m2 ). By putting \u03bb = 1\nand \u03bb\u2032 = 1, we will get the left-left (LL) \u03a0-function, given by\n\u03a0LL (q 2 , m21 , m22 )\n\n= \u2212\n\n1\n4\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u0014\ndx \u2206 + ln\n\n\u03bc2\n2\n\u2212q x(1 \u2212 x) + M 2 (x)\n\nwhere M 2 (x) = m21 x + m22 (1 \u2212 x).\n\n\u0015\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1\nq 2 x(1 \u2212 x) \u2212 M 2 (x) ,\n2\n\n(4.11)\n\nAs before, we denote the SU(2) currents by J\u03bci .

This is a consequence of the breaking of custodial SU(2) due to weak isospin violation. The effect is\ncaptured by\n4\u03c0\n\u2206\u03c1 \u2261 \u03b1T = \u03b1 2\n[\u03a011 (0) \u2212 \u03a033 (0)] .\n(4.15)\nsin \u03b8W cos2 \u03b8W MZ2\nThe dominant effect of isospin violation indeed comes from top-bottom mass splitting, given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4\u03c0\n\u03b1 m2t\nm2t m2b\nm2t\nNc m2t + m2b\nt\u2212b\n\u2206\u03c1\n=\u03b1 2\n\u2243\n\u2212\nln\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2\nmt \u2212 mb\nmb\n\u03c0 MZ2\nsin \u03b8W cos2 \u03b8W MZ2 32\u03c0 2\n\n(4.16)\n\nThe last step follows from the approximation that the ratio (m2b /m2t ) is very small. The dependence on the fermion\nmass is quadratic because the longitudinal gauge bosons are equivalent to the Goldstones whose coupling to fermions are\nproportional to the fermion mass. Also note that in the limit mt = mb , the contribution to \u2206\u03c1 vanishes, as expected.\n\n18\n\n\fThe Higgs contribution is milder in the sense that the dependence on the Higgs mass is logarithmic.

Besides T (\u2261 \u2206\u03c1/\u03b1), two more parameters S (isospin preserving) and\nU (isospin violating but less important than T ) capture the radiative effects. The S parameter is particularly sensitive to\nnon-decoupled type of physics (see definition below). The Higgs contribution to the S parameter is again logarithmic:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0003 Higgs 1\nmh\n16\u03c0 \u0002\n2\n.\n(4.18)\nln\nS \u2261 2 \u03a03Y (0) \u2212 \u03a03Y (MZ ) \u2212\u2192\nMZ\n6\u03c0\nMZ\n\u2022 Note that Bose symmetry does not admit Zhh coupling. The Z boson is a spin-1 particle. If it has to decay into two\nscalars, then the system of two scalars would be in an antisymmetric l = 1 state and there is no other quantum number to\nsymmetrize the system of two identical Bose particles. One can also argue as follows: The Z boson couples in a gauge\ninvariant manner through the corresponding F\u03bc\u03bd , but \u2202\u03bc h\u2202\u03bd h being symmetric in (\u03bc, \u03bd) would not couple to F\u03bc\u03bd .\n\u2022 S, T, U : Why just three? There are four two-point functions: \u03a0\u03b3\u03b3 (q 2 ), \u03a0\u03b3Z (q 2 ), \u03a0ZZ (q 2 ), \u03a0W W (q 2 ). Measurements\nhave been made at two energy scales: q 2 = 0, MZ2 . So there are eight two-point correlators (four types at two different\nscales). Of these eight, \u03a0\u03b3\u03b3 (0) = \u03a0\u03b3Z (0) = 0 due to QED Ward identity. Of the remaining six, three linear combinations are absorbed in the redefinition of the experimental inputs: \u03b1, G\u03bc (Fermi coupling extracted from muon decay)\nand MZ . The remaining three independent combinations are S, T and U . The parameters T and U capture the effects\nof custodial and weak isospin violation, while S is custodially symmetric but weak isospin breaking [32]2 .\n\u2022 Through the total and partial Z decay width measurements, LEP settled the number of light families to be just 3. What\nabout heavier (> MZ /2) families, which cannot be produced at LEP due to kinematic inaccessibility? If the heavier\ngenerations are chiral, i.e. receive mass through Higgs mechanism, then no matter how heavy they are, there is a (nondecoupled) contribution to the S parameter (S = 2/3\u03c0 for each degenerate chiral family) [32]. After maintaining\nconsistency with precision electroweak data, a heavy fourth chiral family can be barely accommodated. This has a lot of\ninteresting consequences, e.g. it broadens the allowed range of the Higgs mass [34].\n\n4.4 Measurements of the radiative effects\nThe \u03c1 parameter is essentially the wavefunction renormalization of the external Z boson line. Therefore, it is of paramount\nimportance in the context of LEP physics. There are three places where radiative corrections enter in a sizable fashion: (i)\n\u221a\nthe vector (vf ) and axial vector (af ) couplings receive an overall \u03c1 multiplication, (ii) the weak angle \u03b8W is modified\nto effective \u03b8\u0304W , and (iii) the Zbb\u0304 vertex receives a large (m2t -dependent) radiative correction. We will not talk about\nthe Zbb\u0304 vertex any more. The other corrections are called 'oblique' corrections which are lumped inside the following\nparametrization:\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0010\n(4.19)\nvf = \u03c1 tf3 \u2212 2Qf sin2 \u03b8\u0304W , af = \u03c1tf3 .\nNow note that the width \u0393f \u221d (vf2 + a2f ), while the forward-backward asymmetry AfFB is a function of vf /af . So,\nthrough a combined measurement of \u0393f and AfFB , one can measure vf and af . It is then straightforward to compare the\nmeasured vf and af with their radiatively corrected SM expectations. Noting, sin2 \u03b8\u0304W \u2243 sin2 \u03b8W \u2212 83 \u2206\u03c1, it is intuitively\nclear that one can make a prediction on the Higgs mass, as the top quark mass is now known to a pretty good accuracy.\n2A\n\ngeneralization of the number of such parameters required to cover all electroweak results was done in [33].\n\n19\n\n\f\u2022 To appreciate why radiative corrections became necessary not long after LEP started running, let us look back\ninto the situation of summer 1992 [35]: the measured vlexp = \u22120.0362+0.0035\n\u22120.0032 , when compared with its tree\n(SM,tree)\nlevel SM prediction vl\n= \u22120.5 + 2 sin2 \u03b8W = \u22120.076 (sin2 \u03b8W obtained from the muon decay data:\n\u221a\nG\u03bc = \u03c0\u03b1(0)/ 2MZ2 sin2 \u03b8W cos2 \u03b8W ), showed a 13\u03c3 discrepancy, inevitably calling for the necessity of dressing the Born-level prediction with radiative corrections. However, just the consideration of running of the electromagnetic coupling \u03b1(0) \u2192 \u03b1(mZ ) and extracting sin2 \u03b8 (to replace sin2 \u03b8W in the expression of vl ) from\n\u221a\ncos2 \u03b8 sin2 \u03b8 = \u03c0\u03b1(MZ )/ 2G\u03bc MZ2 , enabled one to obtain vl = \u22120.037, i.e. within 1\u03c3 of its experimental value\nat that period. The essential point is that it was possible to establish a significant consistency between data and predictions just by considering the running of \u03b1 and it was only much later, with a significantly more data, that the weak\n\u0001\nloop effects (O GF m2t ) were felt. In fact, before the discovery of the top quark at Fermilab (1995), the main indirect\ninformation on the top quark mass used to come from \u2206\u03c1.\n\n5 Constraints on the Higgs mass\n5.1 Electroweak fit\nAs emphasized in the previous section, the Higgs mass enters electroweak precision tests through \u2206\u03c1 and S. The quantum\ncorrections, as we noticed in Eqs. (4.16,4.17,4.18), exhibit a logarithmic sensitivity to the Higgs mass:\n\u2206\u03c1SM \u2243\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 m2t\n\u2212\nln\n2\n\u03c0 MZ\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nmh\nMZ\n\n\u0013\n\n, S h(SM) \u2243\n\n1\nln\n6\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nmh\nMZ\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(5.1)\n\nAt present, the CDF and D0 combined estimate is mt = 173.3 \u00b1 1.1 GeV (updated July 2010 [36]). This translates\ninto an upper limit on the Higgs mass: mh < 186 GeV at 95% C.L. The lower limit mh > 114.4 GeV on the Higgs\nmass is obtained from non-observation of the Higgs by direct search at LEP-2 via the Bjorken process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh\n[36]. Why the limit is so is not difficult to understand: simple kinematics tells us that the limit should roughly be\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns \u2212 MZ \u2243 205 \u2212 91 = 114 GeV, where s is the maximum c.m. energy at LEP-2.\nFig. 2a is the famous blueband plot (August 2009 update shown) which is generated using electroweak data obtained\nfrom LEP and by SLD, CDF and D0, as a function of the Higgs mass, assuming that Nature is completely described by the\nSM. The preferred value for the Higgs mass, corresponding to the minimum of the curve, is 87 GeV, with an experimental\nuncertainty of +35 and \u221226 GeV (68% C.L. which corresponds to \u2206\u03c72 = 1). This serves as a guideline in our attempt\nto find the Higgs boson. The 95% C.L. upper limit (corresponding to \u2206\u03c72 = 2.7) on the Higgs mass is 157 GeV, which\nis pushed up to 186 GeV when the LEP-2 direct search limit of 114 GeV is taken as a constraint in the fit. In a recent\ndevelopment, the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 have excluded the Higgs mass in the range 160 to 170 GeV at 95%\nC.L. In Fig. 2b we see that the extraction of the Higgs mass from individual measurements indicates different ranges,\nthough all are consistent within errors.\n\n5.2 Theoretical limits\n5.2.1 Perturbative unitarity\nUnitarity [37] places an upper bound on mh beyond which the theory becomes non-perturbative. Here, we shall call it\na 'tree level unitarity' as we would require that the tree level contribution of the first partial wave in the expansion of\ndifferent scattering amplitudes does not saturate unitarity (in other words, some probability should not exceed unity). The\nscattering amplitudes involving gauge bosons and Higgs can be decomposed into partial waves, using the 'equivalence\n\n20\n\n\fMarch 2009\n\u0393Z\n\u03c30had\nR0l\nA0,l\nfb\nAl(P\u03c4)\nR0b\n\n6\n\n0\n\nRc\n\nmLimit = 157 GeV\n\nAugust 2009\n\n0,b\n\nAfb\n\nTheory uncertainty\n\n5\n\n0,c\n\n\u2206\u03b1(5)\nhad =\n\nAfb\n\n0.02758\u00b10.00035\n\nAb\n\n0.02749\u00b10.00012\n\nAc\n\n2\n\n4\n\nincl. low Q data\n\nAl(SLD)\nsin \u03b8eff (Qfb)\n\n\u2206\u03c7\n\n2\n\n2 lept\n\nm W*\n\n3\n\n\u0393W*\n\n2\n\nQW(Cs)\n\n\u2212 \u2212\nsin2\u03b8\n\u03b8\u2212\u2212(e\ne)\nMS\n\n1\n0\n\nsin2\u03b8W(\u03bdN)\n\nExcluded\n30\n\ngL2(\u03bdN)\n\nPreliminary\n\n100\n\n2\n\ngR(\u03bdN)\n\n300\n\n*preliminary\n\nmH [GeV]\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nMH [GeV]\n\n10\n\n3\n\nFigure 2: (a) Left panel: The blue-band plot showing the Higgs mass upper limit [36].

First, recall that the SM scalar potential has\nthe following form (Be alert that the normalizations are different from those in Eq. (3.2)):\nV (\u03a6) = \u2212|\u03bc2 |(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6) + \u03bb(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)2 ,\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere\n\u03a6=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6+\n\u03c60\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n=\u221a\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c61 + i\u03c62\n\u03c63 + i\u03c64\n\n\u0013\n\nunitary gauge\n\n=\u21d2\n\n1\n\u221a\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n0\nv + h(x)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nNow consider only the scalar sector of the theory. The scalar quartic coupling evolves as\n\u0012 2\u0013\nd\u03bb\n3\u03bb2\nQ\n.\n= 2 , where t = ln\ndt\n4\u03c0\nQ20\n\n(5.8)\n\nHere Q0 is some reference scale, which could as well be the vev v. The solution of the above equation is\n\u03bb(Q0 )\n\n\u03bb(Q) =\n1\u2212\n\n3\u03bb(Q0 )\n4\u03c0 2\n\n2\n\nln\n\n\u0010\n\nQ2\nQ20\n\n\u0011.\n\n(5.9)\n\nThis means there is a pole at Qc = Q0 e4\u03c0 /3\u03bb(Q0 ) , which is called the 'Landau pole'. This pole has to be avoided during\nthe course of RG running. The general 'triviality' argument states that in order to remain perturbative at all scales one\nneeds to have \u03bb = 0 (which means Higgs remains massless), thus rendering the theory to be 'trivial', i.e non-interacting.\nHowever, one can have an alternative view: use the RG of quartic coupling \u03bb to establish the energy domain in which the\nSM is valid, i.e. find out the energy cutoff Qc below which \u03bb remains finite. If we denote the cutoff by \u039b, then\n1\n\u039b2\n1\n3\n=\n\u2212 2 ln 2 > 0.\n\u03bb(\u039b)\n\u03bb(v) 4\u03c0\nv\nThe above inequality follows from the requirement \u03bb(\u039b) < \u221e \u21d2\n\u03bb(v) \u2264\n\n1\n\u03bb(\u039b)\n\n(5.10)\n\n> 0. This immediately leads to\n\n8\u03c0 2 v 2\n4\u03c0 2\n\u0001 =\u21d2 m2h = 2\u03bbv 2 <\n2\u0001 .\n\u039b2\n3 ln v2\n3 ln \u039bv2\n\n(5.11)\n\nPutting numbers, mh < 160 GeV, for a choice of the cutoff close to the typical GUT scale \u039b = 1016 GeV.\nNow let us include the full structure of fermions and gauge bosons in RG equations.\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\u03bb\n3\n1\n3 \b 4\n2\n2\n4\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\n,\n12\u03bb + 12\u03bbht \u2212 12ht \u2212 \u03bb(3g2 + g1 ) +\n2g2 + (g2 + g1 )\n\u2243\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n2\n16\n\n(5.12)\n\n\u221a\nwhere ht = 2mt /v is the top quark Yukawa coupling. For a rather large \u03bb > ht , g1 , g2 , i.e., for a 'heavy' Higgs boson,\nthe dominant contribution to running is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd\u03bb\n3\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n12\u03bb + 12\u03bbht \u2212 \u03bb(3g2 + g1 ) .\n\u2243\n(5.13)\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n2\nNote that whenever the quartic coupling \u03bb, calculated at the weak scale v, is equal to \u03bbc \u2261 81 (3g22 + g12 ) \u2212 h2t , which\ncorresponds to the vanishing right-hand side of the above RG equation, the coupling reaches a critical limit. If one starts\n\u221a\nthe evolution with a \u03bb(v) > \u03bbc (v), i.e. for mh > mch \u2261 2\u03bbc v, then during the course of RG running the quartic\n22\n\n\fcoupling hits the Landau pole, i.e. becomes infinite, at some scale and the theory ceases to be perturbative. From this\nrequirement, one obtains an upper limit (at two-loop level)\nmh < mch = 170 GeV for \u039b = 1016 GeV.\n\n(5.14)\n\nThe limits for other choices of \u039b can be read off from Figs. 3a and 3b.\n\n5.2.3 Vacuum stability\nThe argument of vacuum stability is based on the requirement that the potential is always bounded from below. This\nmeans \u03bb(Q) has to remain positive throughout the history of RG running. This gives rise to a lower bound on the Higgs\nmass [38\u201340]. If the Higgs mass is too small, i.e., \u03bb is very small, then the top quark contribution dominates which can\ndrive \u03bb to a negative value. If it happens then the vacuum is not stable as it has no minimum. For small \u03bb, Eq. (5.12)\nbecomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd\u03bb\n3\n1\n4\n4\n2\n2 2\n\u221212ht + {2g2 + (g1 + g2 ) } .\n\u2243\n(5.15)\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n16\nTo provide intuitive understanding through easy analytic implementation, we perform a one-step integration and obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0012 2\u0013\n1\n3\n\u039b\n4\n4\n2\n2 2\n\u03bb(\u039b) = \u03bb(v) +\n\u221212h\n+\n.\n(5.16)\n{2g\n+\n(g\n+\ng\n)\n}\nln\nt\n2\n1\n2\n2\n16\u03c0\n16\nv2\nTo ensure that \u03bb(\u039b) remains positive, the Higgs mass must satisfy\nm2h\n\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0012 2\u0013\n3\n\u039b\nv2\n4\n4\n2\n2 2\n12ht \u2212 {2g2 + (g1 + g2 ) } ln\n.\n>\n8\u03c0 2\n16\nv2\n\n(5.17)\n\nClearly, the above steps are very simple-minded, yet provides the rationale behind the lower limit. By actually solving the\nRG equation at 2-loop level, one obtains\nmh > 134 GeV for \u039b = 1016 GeV.\n\n(5.18)\n\nIf the cutoff \u039b = 1 TeV, then [40]\nmh > 50.8 + 0.64 (mt \u2212 173.1 GeV) ,\nwhich indicates that such a low cutoff is clearly disfavored by LEP (see also C. Quigg's article in [5]). Again, the limits\nfor other choices of the cutoff can be read off from Figs. 3a and 3b.\n\n6 Gauge hierarchy problem\n6.1 Quadratic divergence\nLet us illustrate the problem of quadratic\ndivergence\nin\nthrough an explicit calculation.

The first term in the RHS is quadratically divergent.

Suppose, we set \u03bb = 2h2f . First of all,\nthis is a huge fine-tuning. Second, at higher loops, this relation will not be able to prevent the appearance of divergence.\nIt is also amusing to note that if we set \u03bb = h2f , then we would require two scalars to cancel the quadratic divergence\ncaused by one fermion.\n(ii) Suppose we do not attempt to relate \u03bb and hf for canceling the quadratic divergence. Now, remember that we have\na tree level bilinear mass term, which is the bare mass. We can absorb the quadratic divergent in a redefinition of the bare\nh 2 m2\n\nf\nf\nmass. Still, there is a residual finite part to the mass correction, given by \u223c 8\u03c0\n[see Eq. (6.2)]. What is the value of the\n2\nloop mass mf ? If SM gives way to some GUT theory at high scale we can have fermions where mf \u223c MGUT \u223c 1016\nGeV. In that case, even after removing the quadratic cutoff dependence, the leading contribution to \u2206m2h would be order\n2\nMGUT\n/(8\u03c0 2 ). One would then have to do an unnatural fine-tuning (1 \u00f7 1026 ) between the bare term m2h0 and the\ncorrection term \u2206m2h to maintain the renormalized mass (m2h = m2h0 + \u2206m2h ) at around 100 GeV. Furthermore, this\nfine-tuning has to be done order-by-order in perturbation theory to prevent the Higgs mass from shooting up to the highest\nmass scale of the theory. This constitutes what is technically called the gauge hierarchy problem [42].\n\n(iii) The primary problem is that the correction is independent of mh . Setting mh = 0 does not increase the symmetry\nof the theory. In QED, in the limit of vanishing electron mass we have exact chiral symmetry, and since the photon mass\nis zero we have exact gauge symmetry. But there is no symmetry that protects the Higgs mass.\nOne of the biggest challenges in the SM is to stabilize the scalar potential, i.e. to protect it from a run-away quantum\nbehavior. Although we said that it is the Higgs mass which is not stable but, more precisely, it is the electroweak vev (v)\nwhich is unstable. Since v feeds into all masses in the SM through SSB, none of them which is proportional to v is stable\neither. In fact, the argument of protection from gauge and chiral symmetry applicable to QED is strictly not applicable\nfor the SM because all the SM particle masses are proportional to v.\n\n6.2 Cancellation of quadratic divergence in a toy supersymmetric scenario\nSupersymmetry, a theory with an intrinsic fermion \u2194 boson symmetry, unambiguously solves the gauge hierarchy problem and restores naturalness. For an early study of supersymmetric model building and demonstration of quadratic divergence cancellation, we refer to [43, 44]. The content of this subsection is adapted from the text book by Drees, Godbole\nand Roy in [15].\nWe consider a toy model which contains \u03c6(x) = \u221a12 (v + h(x)) plus two additional complex scalar fields f \u0303L,R (x).\nSuppose the interaction is encoded in the following effective Lagrangian:\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\nLf \u0303f \u0303\u03c6 = \u2212\u03bb\u0303f |\u03c6|2 |f \u0303L |2 + |f \u0303R |2 + hf Af \u03c6f \u0303L f \u0303R\u2217 + h.c.\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 h\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n1\nf\n= \u2212 \u03bb\u0303f h2 |f \u0303L |2 + |f \u0303R |2 \u2212 \u03bb\u0303f hv |f \u0303L |2 + |f \u0303R |2 + \u221a Af hf \u0303L f \u0303R\u2217 + h.c. + * * *\n(6.6)\n2\n2\n\n25\n\n\fAbove, the dots correspond to Higgs independent terms which need not be spelt out.

(6.2) [fermion loop] and (6.7) [scalar loops] we make the following observations:\n\u2022 The fermion loop contribution (4[a]) and the scalar loop contribution (4[c]) give quadratic divergence. However, if\n \u0303\none computes the net contribution to the two-point function, given by \u03a0fhh (0) + \u03a0fhh (0), the quadratic divergence\nexactly cancels if one sets \u03bb\u0303f = h2f . This cancellation of quadratic divergence occurs regardless of the magnitude\nof any mass dimensional parameter, namely, mf \u0303L,R or Af .\n\u2022 A log sensitivity to the cutoff (or, the unknown scalar mass) still remains.

Quadratic divergence cancels due to\nthe equality of two types of dimensionless couplings. If supersymmetry is broken in masses, e.g. mf 6= mf \u0303, i.e., gives\nrise to the 'soft' terms (mass dimension < 4) of the Lagrangian, the quadratic divergence still cancels. Also, in the limit\nof exact supersymmetry, i.e., (i) mf = mf \u0303 and (ii) Af = 0, the correction to the Higgs mass exactly vanishes. This toy\nscenario is reminiscent of supersymmetric models.\n\n6.3 The Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)\nWe need two complex scalar doublets of opposite hypercharge to ensure electroweak symmetry breaking.\nH1 =\n\n\u0012\n\nh01\nh\u2212\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n, H2 =\n\nY =\u22121\n\nThere are three reasons behind the need for at least two doublets.\n\n26\n\n\u0012\n\nh+\n2\nh02\n\n\u0013\n\nY =1\n\n.\n\n(6.9)\n\n\fP\nP\n\u2022 Chiral or ABJ (Adler-Bardeen-Jackiw) anomaly cancellation requires\nYf = 0 =\nQf , where the sum is on\nfermions only. If we use only one Higgs doublet, its spin-1/2 (Higgsino) components will spoil the cancellation.\nWe therefore need two Higgs doublets with opposite hypercharge. (This anomaly arises from triangular fermionic\nloops involving axial vector couplings. The theory ceases to be renormalizable if it has ABJ anomaly).\n\u2022 Recall that in the SM we use the scalar doublet \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 = i\u03c42 \u03a6\u2217 for giving masses to up- and down-type fermions.\nIn supersymmetry, \u03a6 is a chiral superfield, and we cannot use a chiral superfield and its complex conjugate in the\nsame superpotential. Therefore, we need two chiral superfields.\n\u2022 Unless we introduce both H1 and H2 , we cannot provide the right number of degrees of freedom necessary to make\nthe charginos massive. In this sense, introducing at least two complex doublets is an experimental compulsion.\nIn the MSSM, the scalar potential VH receives contributions from three sources.\n3\n1X X\n(a) The D term: VD =\nga Si\u2217 T a Si\n2 a=1\ni\n\n!2\n\n:\n\na runs over groups\ni runs over particles\n\n(Si is a generic scalar)\n\nKeeping only the Higgs contributions, i.e. neglecting slepton/squark contributions, we obtain,\n\u0002\n\u0001\u00032\n(1)\nFor U(1)Y : VD = 21 g21 |H2 |2 \u2212 |H1 |2\n,\n\u0011i2\nh \u0010\n(2)\n.

Note two important features at this stage:\n\n\u2022 Only B\u03bc can be complex. However, the phase can be absorbed into the phases of H1 and H2 . Hence, the MSSM\ntree level scalar potential has no source of CP violation.\n\u2022 The quartic scalar couplings are fixed in terms of the SU(2) and U(1) gauge couplings.\nNote that it is sufficient to write the potential keeping only the (neutral) fields which can acquire vevs.\nVH0 =\n\n1 2\n(g + g22 )(|h01 |2 \u2212 |h02 |2 )2 + m\u030421 |h01 |2 + m\u030422 |h02 |2 \u2212 m\u030423 (h01 h02 + h.c.)\n8 1\n\nAgain, note the following points:\n27\n\n(6.11)\n\n\f\u2022 VH0 will be bounded from below if m\u030421 + m\u030422 > 2m\u030423 .

The correction is dominated by the top quark\nYukawa coupling (ht ) and the masses of the stop squarks (t\u03031 , t\u03032 ). The corrected Higgs mass-squared is given by (original\nreferences can be found in [15, 17])\n!\n2\n4\nm\n3m\nt\u0303\nm2h \u2243 MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 + 2 t 2 ln\n,\n(6.24)\n2\u03c0 v\nm2t\n\n29\n\n\f\u221a\nwhere mt\u0303 = mt\u03031 mt\u03032 is an average stop mass, This is a one-loop expression. Including two-loop calculations\npushes the upper limit on the Higgs mass to around 135 GeV. If a neutral Higgs is not found at LHC approximately\nwithin this limit, the two-Higgs doublet version of supersymmetric model will be strongly disfavored. In the next-tominimal supersymmetric model (NMSSM) [45], which contains an additional gauge singlet scalar (N ) coupled to H1\nand H2 through the superpotential \u03bbN H1 H2 , there is an additional tree level contribution to m2h . It turns out that [46]\n\u0002\n\u0003\nm2h (tree, NMSSM) = MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 + 2\u03bb2 (g 2 + g \u20322 )\u22121 sin2 2\u03b2 . Including radiative corrections, the upper limit on mh\nis relaxed to about 150 GeV [47].\n\n6.4 Radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in MSSM\nOne of the most attractive features of supersymmetry is that the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively. Recall that\nin the SM we had to put a negative sign by hand in front of \u03bc2 to ensure EWSB, which was ad hoc. In supersymmetry\nthis happens dynamically thanks to the large top quark Yukawa coupling. We will demonstrate how one of the Higgs\nmass-squared, more precisely m2H2 , starting from a positive value at a high scale is driven to a negative value at low scale\nby RG running. To appreciate the salient features, we will take into consideration only the effect of ht in RG evolution\nand ignore the gauge and other Yukawa couplings' contributions (for details, see text books). This estimate may be crude,\nbut it brings out the essential features. First we write down the RG evolution of m2H2 , m2Q\u0303 and m2\u01693 :\n3\n\ndm2Q\u0303\ndm2H2\ndm2\u01693\n3\n2\n2\n2\n= \u22123ht (m + At ),\n= \u2212h2t (m2 + A2t ),\n= \u22122h2t (m2 + A2t ) ;\ndt\ndt\ndt\n\n(6.25)\n\n2\nwhere Q\u03033 and \u01693 are the third generation squark doublet and singlet respectively, t \u2261 ln(MGUT\n/Q2 )/16\u03c0 2 , ht is the top\n2\nquark Yukawa coupling, At is the scalar trilinear coupling involving the top squark, and m \u2261 m2H2 + m2Q\u0303 + m2\u01693 . Now\n3\nrecall that the Bernoulli's equation\ndy\n+ yP (x) = Q(x)\ndx\nhas a solution\n\u0012Z\n\u0013 Z\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\n\ny exp\n\ndxP (x)\n\n=\n\ndxQ(x) exp\n\ndxP (x) + constant .\n\nTherefore, the equation (obtained by summing the individual RG's in Eq. (6.25))\ndm2\n+ 6h2t m2 = \u22126h2t A2t\ndt\nhas a solution\n\n(6.26)\n\n\u0013 Z t\n\u0012 Z t\nZ\n\u0001\n2 2\n\u2032\n\u2032 2\ndt \u22126ht At exp 6\ndt ht =\nm exp 6\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nt\u2032\n\ndt\u2032\u2032 h2t\n\n!\n\n+ constant .\n\n(6.27)\n\nNow, ignore the running of ht and At to avoid complications, i.e. treat them as fixed values. This eases calculational\nhassles but preserves the important features of radiative EWSB. Then\n\u0001\nm2 exp 6h2t t = \u22126h2t A2t\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\ndt\u2032 exp 6h2t t\u2032 + C = \u2212A2t exp 6h2t t + C .\n\n(6.28)\n\nAt t = 0 (i.e. Q = MGUT ), assume universal boundary conditions, i.e. m20 \u2261 m2H2 = m2Q\u0303 = m2\u01693 . Therefore,\n3\nm2 (t = 0) = 3m20 , hence C = 3m20 + A20 (where At = A0 , since we ignored the running of At ). Using these relations,\nit is simple to obtain the solution\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002\nm2 = \u2212A2t 1 \u2212 exp \u22126h2t t + 3m20 exp \u22126h2t t .\n30\n\n(6.29)\n\n\fNow we solve the individual equations in (6.25).

We observe that at low energy the up-type Higgs masssquared is driven to a negative value due to strong ht -effect. The above assumptions are indeed too simplistic. Addition\nof gauge loops yield additional positive contributions proportional to the gaugino mass-square (Mi2 ). Moreover, running\nof ht and At should also be considered which make the solutions more complicated. All in all, RG evolution enforces a\nsign flip in m2H2 only at the low scale, thus triggering EWSB.\n\n7 Little Higgs\nThe contents of this section (key ideas and illustration) have been developed together with Romesh K. Kaul.\nSee also the discussion on little Higgs models in [6].\nWe first discuss the basic ideas. Pions are spin-0 objects. Higgs is also a spin-0 particle. Pions are composite objects.\nHiggs is perhaps elementary (as indicated by electroweak precision measurements), but it can very well turn out to be\ncomposite. The important thing is that the pions are light, and there are reasons. Can Higgs be light too for similar reasons?\nThe lightness of the pions owes its origin to their pseudo-Goldstone nature. These are Goldstone bosons which arise when\nthe chiral symmetry group SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R spontaneously breaks to the isospin group SU(2)I . The Goldstone scalar \u03c6\nhas a shift symmetry \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + c, where c is some constant. Therefore, any interaction which couples \u03c6 not as \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 breaks\nthe Goldstone symmetry and attributes mass to the previously massless Goldstone. Quark masses and electromagnetic\ninteraction explicitly break the chiral symmetry. Electromagnetism attributes a mass to \u03c0 + (more precisely, to the mass\ndifference between \u03c0 + and \u03c0 0 ) of order m2\u03c0+ \u223c (\u03b1em /4\u03c0)\u039b2QCD . Can we think of the Higgs mass generation in the same\nway? We know that Yukawa interaction has a non-derivative Higgs coupling, so it must break the Goldstone symmetry.\nThen, if we replace \u03b1em by \u03b1t \u2261 h2t /4\u03c0 and \u039bQCD by some cutoff \u039b, we obtain\nm2h \u223c\n\n\u0010\u03b1 \u0011\nt\n\n4\u03c0\n\n\u039b2 .\n\n(7.1)\n\nIs this picture phenomenologically acceptable? The answer is a big 'no', since a 100 GeV Higgs would imply \u039b \u223c 1\nTeV. This is what happens in technicolor models. Such a low cutoff is strongly disfavored by electroweak precision tests.\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b1t 2\n\u03b1t\nbut 4\u03c0\n, i.e. the leading cutoff sensitivity appears\nSuppose that we arrange the prefactor in front of \u039b2 to be not 4\u03c0\nnot at one-loop but parametrically at two-loop order, then the problem might be temporarily solved. Let us see how. The\nHiggs mass will then be given by\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112\nt\n\u039b2 .\n(7.2)\nm2h \u223c\n4\u03c0\nFor mh \u223c 100 GeV, the cutoff would now be \u039b \u223c 10 TeV. In a sense, this is nothing but a postponement of the problem\nas the cutoff of the theory is now pushed by one order of magnitude. The idea of 'little Higgs' is all about achieving this\nextra prefactor of (\u03b1t /4\u03c0) \u2013 see reviews [48] and Refs. [49, 50]. There are indeed other concerns, which we will discuss\nlater.\nTo appreciate the little Higgs trick we look into Fig. 5a. A global group G spontaneously breaks to H at a scale f .\nThe origin of this symmetry breaking is irrelevant below the cutoff scale \u039b \u223c 4\u03c0f .

The Higgs doublet (under SU(2) of I), that would ultimately trigger\nelectroweak breaking, is a part of the Goldstone multiplet that parametrizes the coset space G/H. Choosing G, H and F\nis an open game. There are many choices. We will give some examples in a while. In fact, the little Higgs idea would work\nif the Higgs is a Goldstone boson under two different shift symmetries, i.e., h \u2192 h + c1 and h \u2192 h + c2 . Both symmetries\nhave to be broken. This is the idea of 'collective symmetry breaking'. It is important to note that the generators of the\ngauged part of G do not commute with the generators corresponding to the Higgs, and thus gauge interaction breaks the\nGoldstone symmetry. Yukawa interaction also breaks the Goldstone symmetry. Thus both gauge and Yukawa interactions\ninduce Higgs mass at one-loop level (the cutoff dependence would appear parametrically at two-loop order, as we will see\ntowards the end of this section).\n\n7.1 A simple example with G=SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3)\nFor the purpose of illustration in this review, let us consider a global group SU(3)V \u00d7 SU(3)A . Assume that there are\ntwo scalars \u03a61 and \u03a62 which transform as (3, 3) and (3, 3\u0304) respectively. Now, imagine that each SU(3) spontaneously\nbreaks to SU(2). So we start with 8 + 8 = 16 generators from the two SU(3), and end up with 3 + 3 = 6 unbroken\ngenerators corresponding to the two SU(2) groups. This means that 16 \u2212 6 = 10 generators are broken, thus yielding 10\nmassless Goldstone bosons.\nNow, we gauge SU(3)V , but keep SU(3)A global. Hence, 5 out of 10 broken generators are eaten up as the gauged\nSU(3)V is broken to SU(2), but 5 Goldstone bosons still remain. This happens at a scale higher than that of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, i.e. the corresponding order parameter f is larger than the electroweak vev v. Note that since both\n\u03a61 and \u03a62 transform as 3 under SU(3)V , both couple to the same set of gauge bosons with identical couplings. We can\nwrite \u03a61 and \u03a62 as\n\n\u03a61 = e\n\n\u03b8\ni fE\n\ne\n\n\u03b8\ni fA\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n\u03b8E\n\u03b8A\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 , \u03a62 = ei f e\u2212i f \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\n0\n0\nf + \u03c11 (x)\nf + \u03c12 (x)\n\n(7.3)\n\nAbove, \u03c11 and \u03c12 are real scalar fields which acquire masses \u223c f .

But, until this point, H (in fact, both the charged and neutral components contained\nin H) and \u03b7 are both massless.\n\u0012\n\nNow recall that in the case of pions, the original SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R symmetry was not there to start with, as it was explicitly violated by electromagnetic interaction and quark masses. In the present case, the gauge and Yukawa interactions\nexplicitly violate SU(3)A . This is the reason as to why we will be able to finally write down a potential involving H.\n\n7.1.1 How does gauge interaction violate SU(3)A ?\nWith SU(3)V as the gauge group, the gauge interaction can be expressed as\n(D\u03bc \u03a61 )\u2020 (D\u03bc \u03a61 ) + (D\u03bc \u03a62 )\u2020 (D\u03bc \u03a62 ),\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + igAa\u03bc Ta (a = 1, 2, * * * , 8),\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n\u03b8\n\u03b8A\ni fA \uf8ed\n\u2212i\n\uf8f8 , \u03a62 = e f \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\nwhere \u03a61 = e\n0\n0\nf + \u03c11\nf + \u03c12\n\n(7.5)\n(7.6)\n\nAfter integrating out the heavy (\u223c gf ) gauge bosons \u2013 see Fig. 6a (left panel) \u2013 we obtain the following term in the\neffective Lagrangian\n\u2212\n\n\u0011\ng2 2 \u0010 \u2020\n\u2020\n.\n\u03a6\n\u03a6\n+\n\u03a6\n\u03a6\n\u039b\n2\n1\n2\n1\n16\u03c0 2\n\nNow, we observe two important things:\n\n33\n\n(7.7)\n\n\f\u0013\nh+\n\u2022 \u03b8A -dependence goes away in the above expression. Since the Higgs doublet H =\nis contained inside\nh0\n\u03b8A , it is rotated away in \u03a6\u2020i \u03a6i and is hence insensitive to the quadratic cutoff dependence of Eq. (7.7). This is not\nunexpected as the above piece of the Lagrangian is SU(3)A invariant, and hence is blind to \u03b8A or H.\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2022 The scalar excitations \u03c11 and \u03c12 can sense the quadratic cutoff, and therefore their masses (na\u0131\u0308vely of order \u223c f )\nare not protected. This implies that the vev f is also not protected from quadratic cutoff dependence3.\nWe reiterate that all the shift symmetries of the Goldstone boson have to be broken, as any unbroken symmetry would\nkeep the Goldstone massless. Quadratic divergence appears in those diagrams which involve only a single coupling\noperator, and such an operator cannot sense the breaking of all the symmetries. For Higgs mass generation, the responsible\npieces of the Lagrangian involve all the symmetry breaking operators. Thus, the relevant Feynman diagrams involve more\ninternal propagators, which is why there is no quadratic divergence.\nLet us look at the diagram in Fig. 6b (left panel). After the heavy gauge bosons are integrated out, one obtains the\nfollowing piece of the effective Lagrangian, which breaks the SU(3)A symmetry and hence can contribute to the Higgs\npotential.

Interestingly, the bilinear term has the negative\nsign required for SSB, and the sign of the quartic term is positive as required by the stability of the potential.

The cancellation of quadratic divergence takes place between two sets of diagrams, one that contains the\nmassless SU(2) gauge bosons and the other that contains the massive gauge bosons (see Fig. 5b).

(7.9) and (7.14), the quadratic cutoff sensitivity comes\nback parametrically at two-loop order. To appreciate this, first recall that in the SM the one-loop correction to the Higgs\nmass goes as\n\u039b2\n.\n(7.15)\n\u2206m2h (SM) \u223c\n16\u03c0 2\nThis means that the electroweak vev (v) receives a quadratic (\u039b2 ) correction,\nv2 \u2192 v2 +\n\n\u039b2\n.\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(7.16)\n\nNow consider the gauging of SU(3)V as discussed in the previous subsection.

Then, what purpose did little Higgs serve? In the little Higgs case there is an extra loop suppression\nfactor \u2013 compare Eq. (7.15) with Eq. (7.18). The appearance of the cutoff in the little Higgs models is thus postponed\nby one decade in energy scale compared to the SM. One important thing should be kept in mind. A Goldstone boson\nbecoming massive in little Higgs models is not a surprise. The global symmetry is explicitly broken to start with\nby the gauge and Yukawa interactions, and precisely for this reason the loosely mentioned Goldstone boson is\nactually a pseudo-Goldstone boson (pGB). Up to this point there is no difference with the theory of pions where\nelectromagnetic interaction and quark masses explicitly break the Goldstone symmetry. What is new here, i.e.\n\n36\n\n\fthe reason for which we consider the little Higgs construction as an important achievement over the SM, is the\nappearance of the quadratic cutoff dependence of the Higgs mass at the next order in perturbation theory, i.e. at the\ntwo-loop level.\nIf we want mh \u223c (f /4\u03c0) \u223c 100 GeV, it immediately follows that f \u223c F \u223c 1 TeV, and the cutoff of the theory is\n\u039b \u223c 4\u03c0f \u223c 10 TeV, as against the SM cutoff of 4\u03c0v \u223c 1 TeV. The ultraviolet completion beyond 10 TeV in little Higgs\nmodels is a detailed model-dependent issue [51].\n\n7.2.2 Large quartic coupling\nA clever construction of a little Higgs theory should yield the following electroweak Higgs potential:\n4\n\n(g or ht ) 2\nV =\u2212\nf ln\n16\u03c0 2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039b2\nf2\n\n\u0013\n\n(H \u2020 H) + \u03bb(H \u2020 H)2 ,\n\n(7.19)\n\ni.e., the bilinear term should have a one-loop suppression but, crucially, the quartic interaction should be un-suppressed,\ni.e. \u03bb \u223c g 2 (or h2t ). If both quadratic and quartic terms are suppressed, it is not possible to simultaneously obtain the\ncorrect W boson mass and a phenomenologically acceptable Higgs mass. In the simple scenario used for our illustration,\nboth the quadratic and quartic terms are generated by loops, so the phenomenological problem survives. In more realistic\nscenarios, as we will see shortly, this problem can be avoided. We will discuss only some of these scenarios below.\n\n7.3 Realistic little Higgs scenarios - a brief description\n7.3.1 Different choices of groups\nThe 'littlest Higgs' [49] construction is based on a choice of a global group G = SU(5) which breaks to H = SO(5) by\nthe vev (\u03a30 ) of a scalar field, expanded as \u03a3 = e2i\u03a0/f \u03a30 , where \u03a0 = \u03a0a Xa contains the Goldstone bosons, Xa being\nthe broken generators. The 5 \u00d7 5 vev matrix is given by \u03a30 = anti-diagonal (12\u00d72 , 1, 12\u00d72 ). The subgroup of SU(5) that\nis gauged is [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]1 \u00d7 [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]2 which breaks to SU(2)D \u00d7 U(1)Y . Out of the 14 (= 24 \u2212 10) pGB's\ngenerated during G \u2192 H, four are absorbed as the longitudinal components of the massive gauge bosons AH , ZH and\n\u00b1\nWH\ncorresponding to the broken SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) generators. The other 10 scalar degrees of freedom arrange themselves\nas a complex SU(2) scalar doublet H with the right quantum numbers required to make a SU(2) Higgs doublet with\nhypercharge (= 1/2) and a complex scalar SU(2) triplet \u03a6 with hypercharge (= 1). In the limit when any pair of\ngauge couplings (g1 , g1\u2032 ) or (g2 , g2\u2032 ) goes to zero, the Higgs field becomes exactly massless. Therefore, any loop diagram\ncontributing to the Higgs mass must involve a product g1 g2 (or, g1\u2032 g2\u2032 ). Due to this collective symmetry breaking, all such\ndiagrams are logarithmically sensitive to the cutoff at one-loop.\nThe type of little Higgs models discussed earlier for the purpose of illustration, i.e. where the global group is G =\nSU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) and the gauged subgroup is the simple group SU(3), is called the 'simplest' [50]. The difficulty of\nachieving a large quartic coupling was overcome by considering G = [SU(4)]4 which breaks to H = [SU(3)]4 , while\nthe gauged subgroup is SU(4) \u00d7 U(1) which breaks down to SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). Out of the 28 pGB's 12 are eaten up by the\nmassive gauge bosons. The 16 degrees of freedom are distributed as two complex doublets, three complex singlets and\ntwo real singlet scalars. The scalar quartic coupling is generated at tree level.\n2\n\nThe authors of [52] have considered G = SU(6) and H = Sp(6). The gauged subgroup is [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)] which\nbreaks to SU(2)D \u00d7 U(1)Y . So, out of the 35 \u2212 21 = 14 pGB's four are absorbed by the massive gauge bosons, and\nthe remaining 10 degrees of freedom are decomposed into two complex doublet scalars and one complex singlet scalar.\n\n37\n\n\fA distinct advantage here is that there is no triplet scalar which could have caused some trouble in electroweak precision\ntests (see discussions later).\nThe moose models are on the other hand based on the concept of deconstruction (a term borrowed from Economics).\nThe electroweak sector is described by a product global symmetry GN which is broken by the condensates transforming\nas bi-fundamentals under Gi \u00d7 Gj , where i, j are the sites. In Ref. [53], the global group considered is GN = [SU(3)]8 ,\nand a subgroup of it is gauged which eventually breaks to SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). The scalar spectrum contains two complex\nSU(2) doublets, a complex SU(2) triplet and a complex singlet. To ensure custodial SU(2) symmetry, i.e. to maintain\nconsistency with the oblique \u2206\u03c1 (or, T ) parameter, the global group was enlarged in [54] to [SO(5)]8 with the gauge\ngroup SO(5) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). To further minimize the scalar contribution to \u2206\u03c1, a coset space SO(9)/[SO(5) \u00d7 SO(4)]\nwas constructed with the gauge symmetry SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) [55]. A review of these and many other\nmodels can be found in [48].\n\n7.3.2 Bounds from electroweak precision tests (EWPT)\n2\n\na\nIn an effective field theory description [56], two dimension-6 operators OT \u221d H \u2020 D\u03bc H and OS \u221d H \u2020 \u03c3 a HW\u03bc\u03bd\nB\u03bc\u03bd\nserve as the primary filters before certifying whether a model passes EWPT or not. Recall that an SU(2) global custodial\nsymmetry in the SM guarantees the tree level relation MW = MZ cos \u03b8W . The operator OT violates that symmetry,\nwhich is not difficult to conceive: when H goes to the vacuum, OT \u221d Z\u03bc Z \u03bc but there is no similar contribution for\nW\u03bc W \u03bc , i.e. there is a contribution to MZ but not to MW , and this mismatch violates custodial symmetry. Similarly, the\noperator OS induces kinetic mixing between W\u03bc3 and B\u03bc . The coefficients of OT and OS will, therefore, indicate the\ncontributions to the T and S parameters, respectively.\n\nUnless special care is taken, a general class of little Higgs models gives a large contribution to T , and hence receives\na strong constraint: f > (2 \u2212 5) TeV [57]. A large f means that to obtain the Higgs mass in the 100 GeV range one\nhas to fine-tune the parameters. The constraints arise primarily from the tree level mixing of the SM particles with the\nnew particles. In the littlest Higgs model, the T parameter receives a large contribution from the custodial symmetry\nbreaking trilinear operator H T \u03a6H, which mixes the doublet H with the triplet \u03a6. Also, the WL WH HH term (WL is\nthe SM gauge boson and WH is the heavy one) yields a sizable contribution to T . To circumvent these constraints, the\nauthors of [58] introduced, more in the spirit of R-parity in supersymmetry, what is called T -parity under which all (but\none) new particles are odd and the SM particles are even. It is a discrete Z2 symmetry, which is an automorphism of\nthe gauge groups that exchanges the gauge bosons of [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]1 and [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]2 . It also means g1 = g2 and\ng1\u2032 = g2\u2032 . Under this symmetry H \u2192 H, but \u03a6 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6, so the problematic H T \u03a6H coupling is absent. Contributions\nto T and S from heavy particles arise only at the loop level. As a result, f as low as 500 GeV can be accommodated\nwithout facing any inconsistency with EWPT [59]. It should be noted that there is one new, yet T -even, state in this\nscenario, the so-called 'top partner' which cancels the standard top induced quadratic divergence to the Higgs mass. This\nstate has a positive contribution to the T parameter, and to compensate that one may need a Higgs mass as large as 800\nGeV [59]. Chen's review in [48] covers the EWPT and naturalness constraints on quite a few such scenarios. In a recent\ndevelopment, the authors of Ref. [60] have considered a SO(6) \u00d7 SO(6)/SO(6) model, called it the 'Bestest' little Higgs,\nand claimed that quartic coupling can be generated without violating custodial symmetry (S and T vanish at tree level)\nand at the same time keeping the fine-tuning within 10% in the top sector.\n\n7.3.3 Collider signals of little Higgs models\nSince each little Higgs model involves a G/H coset space and an extended electroweak gauge sector, there are invariably\nnew weak gauge bosons, new fermions and new scalars. To confirm little Higgs models, those news particles have to be\nlooked for in the colliders (see the study made by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC [61]).\n\n38\n\n\fNew gauge bosons: In the littlest Higgs model, the couplings of the heavy gauge bosons ZH and WH with the fermions\nare universal which, beside a mixing angle factor, depend only on the weak isospin t3 of the fermions (i.e. purely lefthanded) and not on the electric charge Q. It has been shown that about 30000 ZH can be produced annually at the LHC\nwith 100fb\u22121 luminosity. These heavy gauge bosons would decay into the SM fermions (VH \u2192 f f \u0304\u2032 ), or into the SM\ngauge bosons (ZH \u2192 WL+ WL\u2212 , WH \u2192 WL ZL , where VL \u2261 VSM ), or into the Higgs and SM gauge boson (VH \u2192 VL h).\nThe branching ratios would follow a definite pattern, which would serve as the 'smoking gun signals' [62, 63].\nNew fermions: Colored vector-like T quark features in almost all little Higgs models. It may be produced singly by\nbW \u2192 T at the LHC. Typically, \u0393(T \u2192 th) \u2248 \u0393(T \u2192 tZ) \u2248 12 \u0393(T \u2192 bW ). This branching ratio relation would\nconstitute a characteristic signature for T quark discovery [62, 64]. When T -parity is conserved, one has a T -odd state\nt\u2212 and a T -even state t+ (which has been referred above as the T quark, and which also cancels the SM top induced\nquadratic divergence to the Higgs mass), and mt+ > mt\u2212 . The QCD production cross section \u03c3(gg \u2192 t\u2212 t\u2212 ) \u2248 0.3 pb\nfor mt\u2212 = 800 GeV, and almost all the time t\u2212 would decay as t\u2212 \u2192 AH t, where AH is the lightest T -odd gauge boson\nwhich, being stable, would escape the detector carrying missing energy [59].\nNew scalars: The presence of a doubly charged scalar \u03c6++ , as a component of a complex triplet scalar, is a hallmark\nsignature of a large class of little Higgs models. Its decay into like-sign dileptons (\u03c6++ \u2192 l+ l+ ) would lead to an\nunmistakable signal with a separable SM background [62]. The other spectacular signal of the doubly charged scalar\nwould be a resonant enhancement of WL WL \u2192 WL WL proceeding via \u03c6++ exchange. An analysis of M (W + W + )\ninvariant mass distribution was carried out in [62] with the claim that with 300fb\u22121 luminosity at the LHC about 100\nevents would pop up over the SM background for m\u03c6++ = 1.5 TeV, assuming a triplet to doublet vev ratio v \u2032 /v = 0.05.\nOne can do a little further by employing the triplet scalar in generating neutrino mass via type-II see-saw. The maximal\nmixing in the \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 sector would predict equal branching ratios of \u03c6++ in the \u03bc+ \u03bc+ , \u03bc+ \u03c4 + and \u03c4 + \u03c4 + channels, which\ncan be tested at the LHC. Employing this correlation, a discovery limit of m\u03c6++ = 700 GeV has been claimed with only\n30fb\u22121 luminosity at the LHC, where the authors take into consideration particle reconstruction efficiencies as well as\nGaussian distortion functions for the momenta and missing energy of final state particles [65].\nWe conclude this section with the statement that little Higgs models with T -parity and supersymmetry with R-parity\nwould be hard to distinguish apart at the LHC. Universal Extra Dimension (UED) with KK-parity would also give similar\nsignals. The best way to study them is to consider their production via strong interaction and their decay via weak\ninteraction. The authors of [66] have concentrated on final states containing an unspecified number of jets, three or\nfour leptons and missing transverse momentum. They have asserted that the jet multiplicity distributions are the crucial\ndiscriminating factors among the scenarios and they have constructed several discriminating variables. This is still an\nopen issue and constitutes a challenging inverse problem.\n\n8 Gauge-Higgs unification\nThe basic idea of Gauge-Higgs unification (GHU) is that the Higgs boson would arise from the internal components\nof a higher dimensional gauge field. As a result, higher dimensional gauge invariance would protect the Higgs mass\nfrom quadratic divergence. When the extra space coordinate is not simply connected (e.g. S 1 ), there are Wilson line\nphases associated with the extra dimensional component of the gauge field (this is conceptually similar to AharonovBohm phase in quantum mechanics). Their 4d quantum fluctuation is identified with the Higgs field. Higher dimensional\ngauge invariance does not allow any scalar potential at the tree level. The scalar potential is generated through radiative\ncorrections. The Higgs boson acquires a mass through this radiatively generated potential. One of the earliest realizations\nof GHU was provided by Antoniadis in a work on extra dimension in the supersymmetric context where the Higgs was\ncoming from N = 4 supermultiplet, i.e. from a higher dimensional gauge field [67]. But for the purpose of illustration\nwe do not bring in any supersymmetric aspect. We rather focus on the underlying dynamics of GHU mechanism in\nnon-supersymmetric extra dimensional context, for which we proceed step by step [68].\n39\n\n\f8.1 5d QED as an illustrative example\nThe 5d Lagrangian, a function of the usual 4d coordinates (x\u03bc ) and the 5th space coordinate (y), is given by\n1\nL (x, y) = \u2212 FMN (x, y)F MN (x, y) + LGF (x, y) , where\n4\n\n(8.1)\n\nFMN (x, y) = \u2202M AN (x, y) \u2212 \u2202N AM (x, y) .\nThe indices M, N = (\u03bc, 5); with \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3. The symbol 'GF' means gauge-fixing.\nThe 5d gauge field AM transforms as a vector under the Lorentz group SO(1,4). In the absence of gauge-fixing, the 5d\nQED Lagrangian is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation\nAM (x, y) \u2192 AM (x, y) + \u2202M \u0398(x, y) .\nThe compactification is on an orbifold S 1 /Z2 , i.e., with y \u2192 (\u2212y) identification. In order not to spoil gauge symmetry\nthe following conditions need to be satisfied, which allows a massless photon in 4d:\nAM (x, y) = AM (x, y + 2\u03c0R) , A\u03bc (x, y) = A\u03bc (x, \u2212y) , A5 (x, y) = \u2212A5 (x, \u2212y) ,\n\u0398(x, y) = \u0398(x, y + 2\u03c0R) ,\n\n\u0398(x, y) = \u0398(x, \u2212y) .\n\n(8.2)\n\nThe above conditions guarantee that the theory remains gauge invariant even after compactification.

In fact, in a sense, the mass generation of heavy KK gauge modes\nby compactification can be viewed as a kind of geometric Higgs mechanism.\nWe should keep in mind that the Lagrangian L (x) is still manifestly gauge invariant by the joint actions of two\ntransformations at each KK level:\n(n)\n\n(n)\n(n)\nA(n)\n(x) ,\n\u03bc (x) \u2192 A\u03bc (x) + \u2202\u03bc \u0398\n\n(n)\n\nA5 (x) \u2192 A5 (x) \u2212\n(n)\n\nNow we use 't Hooft's gauge fixing condition by which the terms that mix A\u03bc\neffective Lagrangian.

In the U(1) example, the scalar turned out to be unphysical. From\nSU(2) we got a physical scalar, which can acquire a nonzero vev. However, we want a scalar which is a doublet under\nSU(2), and the scalar we got in the above example is not a doublet of SU(2). To achieve this, we move to SU(3).\n\n8.3 5d SU(3) as a toy model\nNow consider that the 5d gauge group is SU(3), which is compactified on S 1 /Z2 .

For the A5 scalars, \u2295 and \u2296\nshould be replaced by \u2296 and \u2295, respectively. The fields which are projected with \u2295 sign contain zero modes, but those\nwith the \u2296 sign do not have zero modes.\nAs a consequence of the above projection,\nH\nG\nP\n\u2212\u2192\n.\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1)\nSU(3)\nNow, the 8 generators of SU(3) are decomposed as 3 + 2 + 2 +1 under the unbroken SU(2). From Eq. (8.15), it is clear\n\u0001\n\u0001\nthat only the triplet 3 A1\u03bc , A2\u03bc , A3\u03bc and the singlet 1 A8\u03bc gauge bosons have zero modes. Also, the components of the\n43\n\n\fdoublet 2 scalar A45 \u2212 iA55 , A65 \u2212 iA75\ndoublet, which is expressed as\n\n\u0001T\n\nhave zero modes. We identify the zero mode doublet scalar with our Higgs\n(0)\nH5\n\n4(0)\n\n=\n\n5(0)\n\nA5 \u2212 iA5\n6(0)\n7(0)\nA5 \u2212 iA5\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(8.16)\n\nP\n\nIn other words, when G \u2212\n\u2192 H, the generators of the massless gauge bosons belong to H, while those of the massless\nscalars belong to the coset G/H.\nWe now turn our attention to the gauge transformations in bulk:\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u0398(x, y) + i[\u0398(x, y), A\u03bc ] ,\nA5 \u2192 A5 + \u22025 \u0398(x, y) + i[\u0398(x, y), A5 ] .\n\nFor the scalars A5 , which correspond to the broken generators, \u0398(x, 0) = \u0398(x, \u03c0R) = 0, but still A5 \u2192 A5 + \u22025 \u0398.\nBecause of this shift symmetry, there cannot be any tree level potential for A5 . Just like gauge invariance forbids A\u03bc A\u03bc\nterm in the ordinary 4d QED Lagrangian, the higher dimensional gauge invariance forbids A5 A5 term in the 5d Lagrangian\nas well. But this is true only at tree level, as quantum corrections generate the potential.\nThe quadratic (A5 )2 and the quartic (A5 )4 terms are generated at one-loop level via two- and four-point diagrams\nwith A5 in external lines and with KK fermions and bosons in internal lines. Such loops generate the effective potential\nwhose minimization yields the vev of A5 . The gauge loops tend to push hA05 i to zero while minimizing the potential,\nwhile the fermionic loops tends to shift hA05 i away from zero in the minimum of the potential. In fact, the KK fermions\nare instrumental for generating the correct vev. This way of breaking SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) symmetry to U(1)em is called the\nHosotani mechanism [69]. The one-loop generated Higgs mass is given by\nm2h \u2243\n\ng 4 1 X \u2032\u2032\nV (\u03b1) ,\n128\u03c0 6 R2\n\n(8.17)\n\nKK\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a dimensionless parameter arising from bulk interactions, which corresponds to the minimum of the potential\nwhere the double-derivative is calculated. The summation is over all KK particles. Clearly, 5d gauge symmetry is\nrecovered in the limit 1/R \u2192 0.\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nIn fact, this A5 is a symbolic representation of H5 . A vev in H5 induces SSB of H = SU(2)\u00d7 U(1) to E = U(1)Q .\nThe composition of photon in this scenario is \u03b3\u03bc \u221d (A3\u03bc + \u221a13 A8\u03bc ). Recalling that the composition of photon in the SM\nas given in Eq. (3.19) is,\n\u03b3\u03bc = sin \u03b8W W\u03bc3 + cos \u03b8W B\u03bc ,\nwe obtain the following relations for the GHU scenario under consideration:\n\u03c0\n3\n1\ncot \u03b8W = \u221a = cot \u21d2 \u03b8W = \u03c0/3 \u21d2 sin2 \u03b8W =\n3\n4\n3\n\nand\n\n2\nMW\n1\n= cos2 \u03b8W =\n\u2234 MZ = 2MW .\nMZ2\n4\n\nThis is clearly experimentally ruled out! But this scenario provides the basic intuitive picture of how a GHU scenario\nworks through a simple illustration. In this scenario,\n(n)\n\nMW =\n\nn+\u03b1\nn + 2\u03b1\nn\n(n)\n, MZ =\n, m(n)\n.\n\u03b3 =\nR\nR\nR\n\nThe periodicity property demands that the spectrum will remain invariant under \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 + 1. This restricts \u03b1 in the range\n[0, 1]. Orbifolding further reduces it to \u03b1 = [0, 12 ]. In principle, \u03b1 can be fixed from the W mass.\n\n44\n\n\f8.4 Realistic gauge-Higgs unification scenarios - a brief description\nThere are quite a few obstacles that one faces in constructing a realistic scenario. Since the Yukawa coupling arises from\nhigher dimensional gauge coupling, it turns out to be too small to produce the correct top quark mass. Besides, one has\nalso to worry about generating hierarchical Yukawa interaction starting from higher dimensional gauge interaction which\nis after all universal. The scalar potential is generated at one loop, which tends to yield rather low Higgs boson mass.\nThe compactification scale (R\u22121 ) required for this purpose turns out to be smaller than its experimental lower limit. We\nbriefly describe below some of the attempts made in removing these obstacles.\n(i) It has been argued in [70] in the context of a 5d S 1 /Z2 scenario that large brane localized kinetic term can help\njack up the Higgs mass to an acceptable range. Another option is to break the 5d Lorentz symmetry in the bulk [71, 72].\nThe key observation is that the stability of the loop generated scalar potential relies essentially on 5d gauge symmetry\nand not so much on the SO(1,4) Lorentz symmetry. If one breaks either explicitly or by some dynamics this Lorentz\nsymmetry keeping the SO(1,3) Lorentz symmetry in the ordinary space-time dimension intact, then one can enhance the\nHiggs coupling to fermions. Such breaking can be parametrized by the following pieces of the Lagrangian:\nLgauge\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n1\na\n\u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 F\u03bc5 F \u03bc5 ; LY uk = \u03a8\u0304 i\u03b3\u03bc D\u03bc \u2212 kD5 \u03b3 5 \u03a8 ,\n4\n4\n\n(8.18)\n\nwhere the prefactors a and k need to be phenomenologically tuned to match the data.\n\n(ii) If one goes to an even higher dimensional model, e.g. a 6d GHU scenario, the gauge kinetic term contains a quartic\ninteraction for the internal components of the gauge fields, i.e. it yields a quartic term in the Higgs potential at the tree\nlevel. Its strength of course depends on the gauge coupling. The appearance of this tree level quartic coupling can solve\nthe 'low Higgs mass' problem. But, in these scenarios, gauge symmetry allows some orbifold localized operator which\ngives Higgs mass terms at the tree level, and this brings back the quadratic cutoff sensitivity as encountered in the SM. The\nquestion is, therefore, as how to tame this quadratic cutoff sensitivity. This was pursued in [73] with SU(3) gauge group on\nT 2 /ZN orbifold (with N = 2, 3, 4, 6). It was shown that only for N = 2, under the assumption of successful electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, a condition mh = 2MW has to be satisfied to keep the scalar potential free from quadratic divergence.\n(iii) If one goes to the warped scenario [74], additional features emerge [75]. AdS/CFT correspondence [11] tells us that\na weakly coupled theory in 5d AdS is equivalent to a strongly coupled 4d theory. In this case, the Higgs is a composite\nparticle, a pseudo-Goldstone boson of the strongly coupled CFT sector. There is a global symmetry in the CFT sector\nthat protects the Higgs mass. Gauge and Yukawa interactions are introduced in the dual 5d AdS theory, which explicitly\nbreak the global symmetry but do not induce quadratic divergence to the Higgs mass at any loop. The Higgs mass can\nbe large enough thanks to the quartic interaction which can be generated dynamically at tree level. The quadratic term\nis, as expected, loop generated. The all order finiteness of the Higgs mass can be intuitively understood as follows. The\nHiggs is at the TeV brane and a scalar which breaks the gauge symmetry is at the Planck brane and the information of\nthis breaking reaches from Planck to TeV brane by bulk propagators. This is a non-local effect which is the reason behind\nthe finiteness of the Higgs mass. This type of model was further consolidated in [76] by considering a SO(5) \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L\nsymmetry in the bulk, which eventually gives SO(3) custodial symmetry that prohibits large correction to the oblique T\nparameter. The electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken by the top quark.\nOne distinct advantage of working in the warped space over the flat space is noteworthy. Recall that in the GHU\ncontext the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs arises from higher dimensional gauge coupling. \u221aIn the context of Hosotani\nmechanism [69] in flat space without any large brane kinetic term, the 5d gauge coupling g5 R\u22121 = g4 \u2261 g \u223c 0.65 is\nrather small to yield the Higgs\n\u221a quartic coupling. On the other hand, in the warped case the AdS dynamics gives a rather\nlarge 5d gauge coupling g5 k \u2265 4 [76], which is why the Higgs quartic coupling can be sufficiently large to yield the\ncorrect Higgs mass.\n\n45\n\n\fThere are other GHU constructions in flat and warped space with different features, which we are not going to cover\nhere. We refer the readers to the articles in Refs. [77] and to two excellent reviews on composite Higgs scenarios [24, 78].\n\n8.5 Comparison between gauge-Higgs/composite scenario and little Higgs models\nConceptually, Gauge-Higgs models and little Higgs models are related [75, 76]. More precisely, through the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence gauge-Higgs unification in a 5d warped scenario (Randall-Sundrum model) replicates a little Higgs model\nin 4d. In the conventional (i.e. the way we developed the idea in this review) little Higgs models the sensitivity of the\nHiggs mass to the UV cutoff is logarithmic at one-loop and quadratic at two-loop. In the composite picture, which is dual\nto 5d gauge theory where the 5th component of the gauge boson makes the Higgs boson, the Higgs mass is finite at all\norder. The little Higgs models are calculable below the cutoff scale (\u223c 10 TeV), while the QCD-like composite models\nare calculable in the large N limit allowing 1/N -expansion. There is another difference between the composite models\nand the little Higgs models. The global symmetry that protects the Higgs mass in a composite model is a symmetry of the\nstrong CFT sector and not of the SM. Hence the new TeV scale resonances form a complete multiplet of the global group\nof the strong sector, unlike in the little Higgs models where the new states are the partners of the SM particles. Another\ndistinguishing feature is the presence of a KK gluon in the extra dimensional models that is absent in the conventional\nlittle Higgs constructions.\n\n8.6 Collider signals of gauge-Higgs unification models\nAre there smoking gun signals of the GHU models? These models generally contain fermions with exotic electric charge,\ne.g. (5/3). But the exact value of the charge is a model-dependent question. In most cases, the lightest nonstandard\nparticle turns out to be a colored fermion and not any exotic (KK) gauge boson. This has got something to do with\nthe fact that large contribution from the exotic fermions are crucial in triggering correct amount of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. Also, the gauge boson coupling to the right-handed top quark in such scenarios is about (10-15)% different from\nits SM value. In a study [79], the indirect effects of the KK particles on the Higgs production via gluon fusion and Higgs\ndecay to two photons were analyzed in the context of a toy 5d scenario with SU(3) gauge group on an S 1 /Z2 orbifold.\nIf the KK states weigh around 1 TeV, the loop effects provide about 10% deviation from the SM results. Moreover, the\noverall sign of the gluon-gluon-Higgs coupling was claimed to be opposite to the one in the SM or the UED model,\nbut consistent with the corresponding sign in the little Higgs or the supersymmetric models. In a warped scenario with\nSO(5) \u00d7 U(1)X gauge symmetry in the bulk (chosen for preserving custodial symmetry), the authors of [80] have studied\nthe LHC detection of a KK top quark which is strongly coupled to a KK gluon. In the composite Higgs context, one of\nthe crucial tests is to measure the scattering of the longitudinal gauge bosons (VL VL \u2192 VL VL ) and find an excess event\n(see Ref. [24] for a pedagogical illustration).\n\n9 Higgsless scenarios\nThe idea is to trigger electroweak symmetry breaking without actually having a physical Higgs. The mechanism relies on\nimposing different boundary conditions (BC's) on gauge fields in an extra-dimensional set-up. The BC's can be carefully\nchosen such that the rank of a gauge group can be lowered. For the purpose of illustration outlined in this review, we\nheavily rely on the discussions given in [81, 82]. To start with, we consider a 5d gauge theory. The extra dimension is\ncompactified on a circle of radius R with a y \u2194 (\u2212y) identification, i.e. on a S 1 /Z2 orbifold. The fixed points are\ny = 0, \u03c0R. We can use different BC's at the two fixed points.\n\n46\n\n\f9.1 Types of Boundary Conditions\nLet us consider a 5d scalar field \u03c6(x, y) in the interval [0, \u03c0R]. The minimization of action requires either or both of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 \u03c6|y=0,\u03c0R = Constant. When the Constant = 0, it is called the Dirichlet BC.\n\u2022 (\u22025 \u03c6 + V \u03c6) |y=0,\u03c0R = 0, where V is some boundary mass parameter. When V = 0, \u22025 \u03c6 = 0, which is called\nNeumann BC. When V 6= 0, it corresponds to a mixed BC.\nAlthough we took a scalar field for demonstration, the BC's can be applied to any other field as well. We now perform\nsome warm-up exercises to appreciate the essential features of Higgsless scenarios.\n\n9.2 Breaking SU(2) \u2192 U(1) by BC's\nThis is a simple example to demonstrate that by appropriate choices of BC's we can indeed get a massless gauge boson\nstate (to be identified with the photon) and massive states (to be identified with the W and Z boson). Consider a SU(2)\ngauge symmetry in 5d. The gauge bosons are AaM (x, y), where a = 1, 2, 3 and M = \u03bc, 5. Now we apply the BC's at the\ntwo fixed points.\n\u2022 \u22025 Aa\u03bc |y=0 = 0 for a = 1, 2, 3, i.e. at the y = 0 fixed point, we apply Neumann BC for all the three gauge bosons.\n3\n\u2022 A1,2\n\u03bc |y=\u03c0R = 0, \u22025 A\u03bc |y=\u03c0R = 0, i.e. at the y = \u03c0R fixed point, we apply Dirichlet BC for the first two components\nof the gauge bosons and Neumann BC for the third component.\n\nThe y-dependent parts of the various KK mode gauge fields are then\n\u0010 ny \u0011\n(n = 0, 1, 2, * * *) ,\nA3\u03bc (y) =\u21d2 cos\n\u0013\n\u0012R\n(2m + 1)y\nA1,2\n(y)\n=\u21d2\ncos\n(m = 0, 1, 2, * * *) .\n\u03bc\n2R\n\n(9.1)\n\nTheir mass spectra are therefore given by\nA3\u03bc\nA1,2\n\u03bc\n\n1 2\n, ,* **,\nR R\n1 3 5\n=\n,\n,\n,** *.\n2R 2R 2R\n\n=\u21d2 Mn = 0,\n=\u21d2 Mm\n\nThus we identify\n\n(9.2)\n\n1\n1\n, MZ = .\n(9.3)\n2R\nR\nClearly, this is not a phenomenologically acceptable situation as MZ = 2MW . The main problem here is that the gauge\nboson masses are independent of the gauge couplings. Somehow, we have to bring that dependence in.\nM\u03b3 = 0, MW =\n\n9.3 Breaking SU(2) \u2192 'Nothing' by BC's\nLet us impose the following BC's.\n\n47\n\n\f\u2022 \u22025 Aa\u03bc |y=0 = 0 for a = 1, 2, 3. This is just like the previous example.\n\u2022 \u22025 Aa\u03bc |y=\u03c0R = V Aa\u03bc |y=\u03c0R . This is a mixed BC. The V \u2192 0 limit corresponds to the Neumann BC and the V \u2192 \u221e\nlimit corresponds to the Dirichlet BC. Notice that in the previous example, we took V \u2192 \u221e limit for a = 1, 2 and\nV \u2192 0 limit for a = 3.\nA general solution that satisfies the above BC's is\nAa\u03bc (x, y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nA\u03bca(n) (x)fn (y), with fn (y) = \u03b1n\n\nn=1\n\ncos(Mn y)\n.\nsin(Mn \u03c0R)\n\n(9.4)\n\nSince fn (y) is a cosine expansion, the BC at y = 0 is trivially satisfied. The BC at y = \u03c0R leads to\n\u221e\nX\n\nA(n)\n\u03bc (x)\n\nn=1\n\n(\u2212)\u03b1n Mn sin(Mn y)\nsin(Mn \u03c0R)\n\ny=\u03c0R\n\n=V\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nA(n)\n\u03bc (x)\n\nn=1\n\n\u03b1n cos(Mn y)\nsin(Mn \u03c0R)\n\ny=\u03c0R\n\n,\n\n(9.5)\n\nwhich leads to the following transcendental equation from where the mass spectrum is obtained:\nMn tan (Mn \u03c0R) = \u2212V .\n\n(9.6)\n\nNow observe the following:\n(i) When V = 0, which corresponds to Neumann BC for all a = 1, 2, 3, gauge symmetry is unbroken.\n(ii) When V 6= 0, the SU(2) gauge symmetry is fully broken. The amount of breaking is controlled by V . The mass\nspectrum is given by the solution of the above transcendental equation.\nThe normalization factor \u03b1n is determined by requiring that the KK modes are canonically normalized, i.e.\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c0R\n\ndyfn2 (y) = 1 .\n\n(9.7)\n\u221a\n\n2\nTherefore, using Eq. (9.4), \u03b1n = q\n\u03c0R cosec2 (Mn \u03c0R) +\n\ncot(Mn \u03c0R)\nMn\n\n.\n\n(9.8)\n\nNow using the transcendental equation (9.6), one can express\n\u221a\n2\n\u03b1n = r\n\u0011\n\u0010\nM2\n\u03c0R 1 + V 2n \u2212\n\n.\n\n(9.9)\n\n1\nV\n\nNow we are all set to calculate the mass spectrum. Let us consider the following two cases:\n(i) V = 0: No breaking of gauge symmetry. All Aa\u03bc (a = 1, 2, 3) have a cosine expansion.\n(ii) V 6= 0: We assume V \u226b R1 . Then the transcendental equation (9.6) implies that to the zeroth approximation\ncot(Mn \u03c0R) = 0. This means Mn \u03c0R = (2n + 1) \u03c02 , i.e.\nMn =\n\n2n + 1\n(n = 0, 1, 2, * * *) .\n2R\n48\n\n(9.10)\n\n\fThen to the next level of approximation, we take Mn \u03c0R = (2n + 1) \u03c02 + \u01eb, where \u01eb is a small number. Then\n\b\n\b\ncot(Mn \u03c0R) = cot (2n + 1) \u03c02 + \u01eb = cot(2n + 1) \u03c02 + \u01eb \u2212 cosec2 (2n + 1) \u03c02 = \u2212\u01eb . Putting back the above\nrelation into the transcendental equation, we obtain \u01eb = MVn . Therefore, Mn \u03c0R = (2n + 1) \u03c02 + MVn , i.e.\n2n + 1\nMn \u2243\n2R\n\n\u0012\n1+\n\n1\n+***\n\u03c0RV\n\n\u0013\n\n(n = 0, 1, 2, * * *) .\n\n(9.11)\n\nClearly, there is no zero mode. SU(2) gauge symmetry is thus completely broken.\n\n9.4 A model of EWSB by BC's: Higgsless scenario in flat space\nRight at the beginning, we set two goals:\n(i) The gauge boson masses have to be related to the gauge couplings.\n(ii) There should be a custodial symmetry in the bulk so as to be consistent with EWPT.\nWe therefore start with the gauge symmetry SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L in the bulk. The notations of gauge bosons\nand gauge couplings are as follows (Dimension of a 5d gauge coupling is M \u22121/2 ):\n\u2022 Group: SU(2)L , gauge coupling: g, gauge bosons: ALa\nM where a = 1, 2, 3.\n\u2022 Group: SU(2)R , gauge coupling: g, gauge bosons: ARa\nM where a = 1, 2, 3.\n\u2022 Group: U(1)B\u2212L , gauge coupling: g \u2032 , gauge bosons: BM .\nWe denote the gauge bosons of the SU(2)D group, which is the diagonal subgroup of SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R , as A+a\nM , where\n\u0001\nLa\nRa\n\u221a1\nA\n\u00b1\nA\n.\nWe\nshould\nremember\nthat\nin\norder\nto\nhave\na\nzero\nmode\nof\na\ngeneric\ngauge\nboson\nA\u03bc , i.e.\nA\u00b1a\n=\nM\nM\nM\n2\nto preserve the gauge symmetry, one should use Neumann BC: \u22025 A\u03bc = 0. Although we display below the BC's of the\ngauge fields A\u03bc and B\u03bc only, the conditions for A5 and B5 are not hard to obtain. We just have to remember that the\nconditions have to be swapped between the \u03bc and y components. In other words, the Dirichlet BC's for gauge bosons\nmean Neumann BC's for the corresponding scalars and vice versa. We now apply the following BC's at the two fixed\npoints:\n\u2022 y = 0 fixed point:\n(i) \u22025 A+a\n\u03bc = 0 and \u22025 B\u03bc = 0 (i.e. SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R broken down to SU(2)D , also U(1)B\u2212L unbroken).\n\n(ii) A\u2212a\n\u03bc = 0 (i.e. the SU(2) orthogonal to SU(2)D is broken).\n\u2022 y = \u03c0R fixed point:\n(i) \u22025 ALa\n\u03bc = 0 (i.e. SU(2)L unbroken).\n\n2\n(ii) \u22025 A\u03bcR 1,2 = V A\u03bcR 1,2 , where V = \u2212 41 g 2 vR\n. At the y = \u03c0R brane we localize a scalar doublet under SU(2)R ,\nwhich acquires a vev vR leading to SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L breaking down to U(1)Y . Eventually, we take the\nvR \u2192 \u221e limit and the scalar will decouple without spoiling unitarity.\n\u0001\nV\nR3\n\u2032\n(iii) \u22025 AR3\n\u03bc = g gA\u03bc \u2212 g B\u03bc .\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(iv) \u22025 B\u03bc = \u2212 Vgg2 gAR3\n\u03bc \u2212 g B\u03bc .\n\n49\n\n\fThe last three BC's ensure that both SU(2)R and U(1)B\u2212L are broken when V 6= 0. Note additionally that\n\u0001\n\u22025 g \u2032 AR3\n\u03bc + gB\u03bc = 0. Finally, the only symmetry left unbroken is U(1)Q .\nThe BC's originate from the following consideration: The orbifold projection around y = 0 fixed point has a SU(2)L \u21cb\nSU(2)R outer automorphism, while around y = \u03c0R fixed point the orbifold projections are SU(2)L \u2194 SU(2)L and\nSU(2)R \u2194 SU(2)R . Define \u0177 = y + \u03c0R. The BC's can be derived from\nALa\n\u03bc (x, \u2212y)\n\nALa\n\u03bc (x, \u2212\u0177)\n\n= ARa\n\u03bc (x, y) ; B\u03bc (x, \u2212y) = B\u03bc (x, y) ;\n\nRa\nRa\n= ALa\n\u03bc (x, \u0177) ; A\u03bc (x, \u2212\u0177) = A\u03bc (x, \u0177) ; B\u03bc (x, \u2212\u0177) = B\u03bc (x, \u0177) .\n\n(9.12)\n\nOnce the BC's are enforced, a given 4d gauge field is shared among many 5d fields.

(9.13) we take the expression for B\u03bc and look at its expansion for y = 0:\ni\nh\n\u221a\n1\nB\u03bc (x, 0) = p\ng\u03b3\u03bc (x) + 2g \u2032 Z\u03bc(1) (x) + higher Z\u03bc(n) terms .\n\u03c0R(g 2 + 2g \u20322 )\n\n(9.23)\n\nNote that the mass dimension of the 5d B\u03bc is 32 while that of the 4d B\u03bc is 1. Now we compare Eq. (9.23) with the SM\nexpression of B\u03bc in terms of the photon and Z boson fields, namely,\n1\nB\u03bc = p 2\n[g4 \u03b3\u03bc + g4\u2032 Z\u03bc ] .\ng4 + g4\u20322\n\n(9.24)\n\n\u221a\nIt immediately follows that (g4\u2032 /g4 ) = ( 2g \u2032 /g).

Without actually having a Higgs\nboson, just by applying BC's on the boundaries, one can get the correct W and Z masses.\n\n52\n\n\f(ii) In this scenario \u2206\u03c1 \u223c 10% is far too large. This scenario is thus disfavored by EWPT. A slightly more acceptable\nvalue of \u03c1 can be obtained by keeping a finite vR at the y = \u03c0R fixed point. Then unitarizing the theory would be a\nproblem. The reason for such a large \u2206\u03c1 is the following. Although the bulk and the y = 0 brane respect custodial SU(2),\nthe y = \u03c0R brane does not. Since the KK wave functions have significant presence around the y = \u03c0R brane, a large \u2206\u03c1\nresults. The remedy lies in expelling the higher (n > 1) KK modes from the custodial symmetry breaking brane.\n\n9.5 Features of realistic Higgsless scenarios\n9.5.1 Warped models and oblique parameters\nOne of the advantages of going to the warped extra dimension is that the contributions to the S and T parameters can be\nkept under control. Following Ref. [83], we consider a conformally flat metric\n\u0001\nds2 = h(y)2 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dy 2 ,\n\n(9.27)\n\nwhere the extra spatial dimension is in the interval [R, R\u2032 ]. A flat extra dimension scenario can be recovered if h(y) =\nconstant, while the AdS limit is obtained when h(y) = R/y. Typically, R\u22121 \u2248 MPl and (R\u2032 )\u22121 \u2248 TeV scale. The gauge\nsymmetry in the bulk corresponds to SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L , and the choice of the left-right gauge symmetry\nis motivated from the requirement of a custodial symmetry for EWPT consistency. The W and Z boson masses in this\nscenario are given by (with the approximation R\u2032 \u226b R)\n2\nMW\n\u2248\n\n1\nR\u20322 ln\n\nR\u2032\nR\n\n\u0001 , MZ2 \u2248\n\n1\ng 2 + 2g \u20322\ng 2 + g \u20322 R\u20322 ln\n\nR\u2032\nR\n\n\u0001,\n\n(9.28)\n\nwhere g(= gL = gR ) and g \u2032 are 5d SU(2) and U(1) gauge couplings, respectively. In the leading order T (or equivalently\n\u2206\u03c1) and S are both vanishing \u2013 this is the limit when the warp factor is infinitely large, i.e. when the Planck brane is\nmoved to the AdS boundary. For a finite warped factor, T and S will be suppressed by ln(R\u2032 /R). Since a 5d warped\nmodel is dual, in the AdS/CFT sense, to a 4d theory involving a strongly coupled sector which is conformally invariant\nbetween the Planck scale and the TeV scale, a lot of insight can be achieved about the origin of T and S suppression from\nthis correspondence. Weakly charged left-right gauged symmetry in the 5d bulk ensures a global custodial symmetry in\nthe strongly coupled CFT side which keeps T and S under control [84].\nAn important question that naturally arises in the Higgsless context is how to generate the fermion masses. In the\nabsence of a Higgs, one cannot write a Yukawa coupling. But just like in the case of gauge bosons, appropriate boundary\nconditions for fermions would generate their masses. But where to localize the fermions? They cannot be localized at the\nUV (Planck) brane where the gauge symmetry is that of the SM. The reason is that the theory at the UV brane is chiral and\nthere is no way a zero mode chiral fermion mass can be generated. On the other hand in the IR (TeV) brane the unbroken\ngauge symmetry corresponds to SU(2)D which preserves isospin and would yield equal up- and down-type masses. So\nthe SM fermions have to be placed inside vector-like multiplets residing in the 5d bulk which should feel different gauge\nsymmetry breaking at the two boundaries [85]. Needless to mention that orbifold projection, or equivalently a set of\nappropriate BC's, removes half of the vector-like spectrum yielding a chiral fermion structure at the lowest KK level.\nAlso, when the fermions are delocalized from the boundaries and judiciously placed at different locations in the bulk,\ntheir couplings with the KK gauge bosons can be made to vanish, which minimizes the S parameter [84].\nThe third family continues to give some headache. The requirement of a large top quark mass necessitates the localization of the tL (and hence bL ) field(s) near the TeV brane. At this brane, because the unbroken gauge symmetry is\nSU(2)D \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L , the ZbL bL coupling is different from its SM value, which leads to a contradiction with the precision\nmeasurement of the Zbb vertex through Rb . This problem can be solved, but at the price of making the model more complicated, e.g. by invoking a separate mechanism of the top quark mass generation (analogous to the concept of topcolor\n53\n\n\fin technicolor models). To sum up, the localization of the third family is a major thorn in the construction of realistic\nHiggsless models.\nMoose models: Several features of Higgsless models have been investisgated in the context of deconstructed gauge\ntheories by discretizing the extra dimension. By doing it we get a finite set of 4d gauge theories, each corresponding\nto a particular lattice site [86]. The fifth component\nof\n\u0011 the gauge field, A5 , which is the connection field, goes into the\n\u0010\n(i\u22121)\nrealizing the parallel transport between two lattice sites, where a\ndefinition of the 'link variable' \u03a3i \u2261 exp \u2212iaA5\n\nis the lattice spacing. The link variables can be identified with 'chiral fields' which satisfy the condition \u03a3\u03a3\u2020 = 1 [87].\nIn this way, the 5d gauge theory is replaced by a collection of 4d gauge theories with chiral fields \u03a3i having gauge\ninteractions \u2013 this is described by 'moose diagram'. A moose diagram is like a Feynman diagram where lines correspond\nto links and vertices to gauge groups. If there is no loop, then one can show that G = E \u2212 1, where G is the number\nof remaining Goldstone multiplets and E is the number of external links. Clearly, we need at least two external links\nto construct a minimal model (which has only one Goldstone multiplet). It has been shown that in this scenario the\nS parameter can be made vanishingly small either by ideal fermion delocalization [88], or by introducing a dynamical\nnonlocal field connecting the two ends of a moose [89].\n\n9.5.2 Tension between unitarity and EWPT\nThis is a major issue that decides the fate of a Higgsless model. We follow the discussions in Ref. [90]. First, we ask the\nobvious question: what unitarizes the theory in the absence of the Higgs? If we consider the elastic scattering process\nWL\u00b1 ZL \u2192 WL\u00b1 ZL , then in the absence of the Higgs boson the amplitude will go like\n2\ngW W ZZ \u2212 gW\nWZ\n\n\u0001\u0002\n\n\u0003\naE 4 + bE 2 + * * * ,\n\n(9.29)\n\nwhere the notations for the three- and four-point gauge couplings are self-explanatory. In the Higgsless models, there\nare additional KK gauge bosons. The charged vector boson KK states Vi\u00b1 , which the same Vi W Z Lorentz structure as\nthe SM W W Z, would contribute to the above amplitude. However, once we take into account the contributions from all\nthe states i = 1, 2, * * * , \u221e and two sum rules involving the trilinear gauge couplings are satisfied, the new contributions\ncompletely cancel the E 4 and E 2 growths. This is a consequence of higher dimensional gauge symmetry. However, the\nresidual growth would make the Higgsless theories break down at a few TeV scale. In fact, at higher energies increasing\nnumber of inelastic channels lead to unitarity violation by inducing a linear growth. This is not unexpected from a 5d\npoint of view, as the dimensionless 5d loop factor grows with energy as g 2 E/24\u03c0 3 , where g is the 5d gauge coupling. In\nthe warped Higgsless scenarios, the naive dimensional analysis (NDA) cutoff would boil down to:\n\u039bNDA \u223c\n\n2\n12\u03c0 4 MW\n,\ng 2 MW (1)\n\n(9.30)\n\nwhich is around 12 TeV, putting MW (1) \u223c 1.2 TeV. Explicit calculation shows that this simple estimate is valid up to a\nfactor of 1/4 [91]. What we thus learned is that in the Higgsless scenario, because of the appearance of the new weakly\ncoupled states in the TeV scale, the unitarity saturation is postponed by roughly a factor of 10 beyond the SM NDA cutoff\nscale \u039bSM\nNDA \u223c 4\u03c0MW /g \u223c 1.8 TeV. Clearly, heavier the KK W boson the lower is the scale at which perturbative\n2\n2\n\u2032\nunitarity is lost. Now, MW\n(1) /MW = O (ln(R /R)). If we increase R, i.e. lower the UV cutoff from the Planck scale,\nthen the first KK W boson mass decreases from 1.2 TeV to sub-TeV and the NDA cutoff scale goes up. But one cannot\narbitrarily increase R, as this would increase the T parameter which varies as 1/ ln(R\u2032 /R) \u2013 see Fig. 4 of [90] \u2013 even\nthough S can be kept under control via fermion delocalization. The tension between extending the domain of perturbative\nunitarity and at the same time fitting precision electroweak data have also been discussed in scenarios [92].\nThree- and four-site Higgsless models: In the language of deconstruction, delocalization of fermions correspond to\nallowing them to derive their electroweak properties from more than one lattice sites or gauge groups. It has been shown\n54\n\n\fin Ref. [93] that a linear moose model, with several SU(2) gauge fields along the string and SU(2)L and U(1)Y as the\ntwo end-points, can reconcile EWPT constraints and increased unitarity bound at the expense of some fine tuning. It has\nbeen demonstrated in Ref. [94] that several properties of the Higgsless models, like ideal fermion delocalization, EWPT\nconsistency, fermion masses, etc., can be illustrated in a highly deconstructed model with only three sites. The electroweak\npart of the gauge group corresponds to SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\u00d7 U(1), i.e. it contains only one 'interior' SU(2) group. It therefore\ncontains only one set of (W \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) states, which can be arranged to be fermiophobic to minimize precision electroweak\ncorrections. If one extends this three-site model by one more site, i.e. with one more interior SU(2) gauge group making\nit a four-site Higgsless model, the gauge boson resonances need not be fermiophobic to satisfy EWPT constraints [95].\n\n9.5.3 Collider signatures of Higgsless models\nThe strongly coupled physics in the Higgsless scenario at a scale which is roughly 10 times \u039bSM\nNDA as a result of delayed\nunitarity violation, is too large to be observed at the LHC. But it will be possible to pin down those weakly coupled states\nwhich are responsible for unitarity postponement. In this context we follow the analysis in Ref. [96]. Different Higgsless\nmodels vary in different aspects, like fermion placements and how the SM particles interact with the KK states, but the\nmechanism by which \u039b is raised is common to all. Weakly coupled TeV-size new massive vector bosons Vi (where i is\nthe KK label), whose couplings to the SM gauge bosons are dictated by the unitarity sum rules, enforce the cancellation\nof the E 2 and E 4 terms in the amplitudes of longitudinal gauge boson scattering thereby postponing unitarity violation.\nWhat are the experimental signatures of Vi bosons? It is advantageous to consider the production of these vector bosons\nby the SM gauge boson fusions as the couplings between the Vi and the SM W/Z bosons are pretty model independent\ndictated by the unitarity sum rules. The sum rule implies the following inequality\ngW W Z MZ2\n(1)\n.\ngW ZV \u2264 \u221a\n3M1\u00b1 MW\n\n(9.31)\n\n(1)\n\nPutting M1\u00b1 = 700 GeV gives gW ZV \u2264 0.04, which means that the heavier the mass of V1 the less is the chance to\nproduce it at the LHC. If we study the scattering channel W \u00b1 Z \u2192 W \u00b1 Z, a process which can be mediated by V1\u00b1 in the\ns-channel, there will be a sharp resonance as soon as the V1 threshold is crossed. Recall that a t-channel Higgs exchange\nunitarizes this amplitude in the SM which therefore does not give any resonance. Conventional theories of strong EWSB\ndynamics may give a somewhat heavier (\u223c 2 TeV) resonance but that would be broad due to strong coupling. But in the\nHiggsless theories, V1 can be as light as 700 GeV, and the resonance will be narrow because the V1 decay width is very\nsmall. The reason is the following: the decay of V1\u00b1 takes place only in a single channel, and the width is given by\n\u0393(V1\u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 Z) \u2248\n\n\u03b1(M1 )3\n,\n2\n144 sin2 \u03b8W MW\n\n(9.32)\n\nunder the assumption that the unitarity sum rule is saturated by the first set of KK vector boson states (i.e. with just i = 1\nof Vi ). Putting M1 = 700 GeV, the width turns out to be only about 13 GeV. We must remember that V1\u00b1 do not have\nany significant fermionic couplings as otherwise EWPT consistency will be jeopardized. Further details of V1\u00b1 search\nstrategies are beyond the scope of this review.\n\n10 Conclusions and Outlook\n1. We take a snapshot of all the limits on the SM Higgs mass:\n\u2022 Direct search: mh > 114.4 GeV (at LEP-2, from non-observation in the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh channel).\n55\n\n\f\u2022 EWPT: mh < 186 GeV (at 95% C.L., with direct search non-observation as a constraint in the fit).\n\u2022 Perturbative unitarity: mh < 780 GeV (in the 2WL+ WL\u2212 + ZL ZL channel).\n\u2022 Triviality: mh < 170 GeV for \u039b = 1016 GeV (scalar quartic coupling should not hit the Landau pole).\n\u2022 Vacuum stability: mh > 134 GeV for \u039b = 1016 GeV (quartic coupling should always stay positive).\nIn the MSSM, there is a firm prediction on the upper limit of the lightest Higgs mass. If the top squarks weigh around a\nTeV, then mh <\n\u223c 135 GeV.\n2. All the BSM models we have considered are based on calculability and symmetry arguments. In all cases, the\nelectroweak scale MZ can be expressed in terms of some high scale parameters ai , i.e., MZ = \u039bNP f (ai ), where \u039bNP is\nthe new physics scale and f (ai ) are calculable functions of physical parameters. In all these models\n\u2022 The new physics scales originate from different dynamics: \u039bSUSY \u223c MS (the supersymmetry breaking scale);\n\u039bLH \u223c f \u223c F (the vev associated with G \u2192 H breaking); \u039bGHU \u223c R\u22121 (the inverse radius of compactification).\n\u2022 The dynamical sign-flip of a scalar mass-square happens not only in supersymmetry, but also in little Higgs models\nand in Gauge-Higgs unification scenarios. In all cases, the large top quark Yukawa coupling plays a crucial r\u00f4le. A\npositive scalar quartic coupling can be arranged in all these scenarios.\n3. In supersymmetry, the cutoff can be as high as the GUT or the Planck scale. In little Higgs as well as in many variants\nof extra dimensional scenarios the cutoff is significantly lower. The ultraviolet completion in little Higgs models is an\nopen question, though some attempts have already been made in this direction.\n4. In supersymmetry the cancellation of quadratic divergence takes place between a particle loop and a sparticle loop.\nSince a particle cannot mix with a sparticle, the oblique electroweak corrections and the Zbb\u0304 vertex correction can be\nkept under control. In the non-supersymmetric scenarios (recall what happens in little Higgs models), the cancellation\noccurs between loops with the same spin states. Such states can mix among themselves, leading to dangerous tree level\ncontributions to electroweak observables. This is the reason why a decoupling theory like supersymmetry is comfortable\nwith EWPT, while a technicolor-like non-decoupling theory faces a stiff challenge from EWPT.\n5. How to distinguish between the different models in colliders? We have already discussed some of the smoking gun\nsignals of different scenarios. Here we highlight a few features that are the trademark signals of some specific models. We\nfirst compare supersymmetry with little Higgs models. The chances are very high that one may mistake supersymmetry\nwith R-parity for little Higgs with T -parity or vice versa in the LHC environment, since the pattern of cascade decays in the\ntwo models are very similar and particle spin measurements are, in general, difficult. A dictionary between superparticles\nand little Higgs heavy states is the following: (i) Electroweak gauginos \u2194 T -odd gauge bosons, (ii) Sfermions \u2194 T -odd\nfermion doublets, (iii) Second Higgs doublet \u2194 Scalar triplet, (iv) Higgsinos and gluino \u2194 None, (v) None \u2194 T -even\ntop partner. What is interesting to observe is that there is no analog of gluino in little Higgs models, and no analog of t+\nin supersymmetry.\nIn a general class of composite Higgs models (e.g. gauge-Higgs unification or little Higgs), the strengths of V V h\nand V V hh couplings are different from their SM predictions. A recent work suggests that double Higgs production via\nWL WL \u2192 hh can be an interesting probe for verifying the compositeness of the Higgs since the rate of this process is\nmuch larger (than in the SM) if h is a pseudo-Goldstone boson [97].\nThe presence of a KK gluon in a gauge-Higgs unification model differentiates it from a little Higgs model. Moreover,\nthe gauge-Higgs models have a special feature that their lightest nonstandard particle is a colored fermion and not a KK\ngauge boson. Such models also contain fermions with exotic electric charge, whose value is different in different models.\n56\n\n\fThe Higgsless models are characterized by the presence of the Vi vector boson states that delay the unitarity saturation.\nThe lightest of such states may pop up in the scattering of W \u00b1 Z \u2192 W \u00b1 Z as an s-channel narrow resonance.\n6. The model-builders have three-fold goals: (i) unitarize the theory, (ii) successfully confront the EWPT, and (iii) maintain naturalness to the extent possible. The tension arises as naturalness criteria requires the spectrum to be compressed,\nwhile EWPT compatibility pushes the new states away from the SM states.\n7. A dark matter candidate is badly needed to justify observational evidence. Besides the neutrino mass, dark matter\nprovides the only other concrete experimental motivation to go beyond the SM. The SM fails to provide it. A favorite\nsupersymmetric candidate is the lightest neutralino if R-parity is conserved. The Little Higgs models provide a heavy\nstable gauge boson if T -parity (which can be defined in 'littlest' Higgs model) is conserved. In extra dimensional models,\nthe lightest Kaluza-Klein particle is a stable dark matter candidate if KK-parity is conserved.\n8. After all is said and done, the LHC is a win-win machine in terms of discovery. If we discover the Higgs, we would\nexpect to discover also the new states that tame the unruly quantum correction to its mass. If the Higgs is not there, the\nnew resonances which would restore unitarity in gauge boson scattering would be crying out for verification. In order to\nidentify the latter, we need the super-LHC (the high luminosity option) to cover the entire spectrum. However, once we\nobserve some new states at the LHC, we definitely need a linear collider to know what these states actually are.\nAcknowledgments: I am indebted to Romesh Kaul for sharing his insights, particularly in little Higgs models, and for\nvaluable comments on the manuscript.
