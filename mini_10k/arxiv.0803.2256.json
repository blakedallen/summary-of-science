By making possible new forms of social interactions as well\nas new ways to probe them, the Internet provides a unique tool for studying the development\nand the organization of an archetypical complex system.\nBut, as in all complex biological and social systems known to us, upgrades of capacity,\nimproved networking and additions of functionalities come together with its bundle of parasites, viruses and criminals. We ask what are the laws, in any, codifying this dynamics, and\nwhat are the possible roles and consequences of such apparently negative developments?\nIn biology, there is a growing realization that evolution has been driven and shaped\nby bacteria and viruses [1]. Similarly, social organizations, which are founded on laws\nand regulations, and which are anchored on national (as well as sub- and super-national)\nboundaries, have arguably been shaped in significant part by the need to coordinate and\ncooperate in the face of disruptions emerging from within and from the outside. In this\nvein, we ask what may the exploding level of criminality and of unlawful exploitation of the\nInternet teach us on the organization of other complex systems? Are there robust dynamics\nor universal laws that can be inferred and tested? What does the fact, that electronic crime\nhas appeared and developed concommittantly with the growth of the Internet, teach us on\nits organization, its vulnerabilities and its future development?\nGiven the breadth of these questions, our contribution is to focus on a specific criminality which is now becoming rampant, the theft of personal information (ID thefts). Using\nthe most complete dataset from the Open Security Foundation [2], we are able to identify\nan explosive growth of ID losses followed by a regime which seems to have matured into\na stationary phase. We document a very heavy-tailed power-law distribution (an often reported hallmark of complex systems) of severities of ID theft events, which is robust over\nall time periods and across different types of social organizations (private and public). By\nquantifying the scaling of losses as a function of organization sizes, we unearth a significant\nsize effect.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nMATURATION AND SEVERITY OF ID LOSSES: NON-STATIONARY AND\n\nSTATIONARY PROPERTIES\nA.\n\nContextual data description\n\nFrom early (gentle) hackers breaking in systems to demonstrate their skills, some turned\ninto seasoned \"black hats\" making money as part of an explosively growing business based\non ubiquitous Internet insecurity[3, 4]. Compared with the attacks that used to disrupt\nnetwork on a large scale, most electronic attacks nowadays extract out valuable data while\nremaining quite furtive [5]. This can be likened to an electronic form of massive parasitism.\nIn terms of monetary value and volume, one of the largest types of data targeted by pirates\nis personal identity information (ID), such as credit card numbers, social security numbers,\nbanking accounts, and medical files. Since each ID theft or leakage is a \"loss of control\" of\none's individual private data, it can be considered already as a damaging event, forerunning\nthe potential realized financial and/or social losses [6]. Actually, stealing ID's is the goal\nwhich is common to a wide spectrum of non-destructive Internet attacks focused on profit,\nfrom botnets to highly tailored attacks [7, 8, 9, 10]. The (uncontrolled) dissemination of\npersonal information raises the important social issue of people's identity resilience in the\ninformation technology era [5, 6]. In our quantitative study of cyber-risks, we take a ID theft\nas a usable elementary unit of cyber-risks, for two main reasons. First, it provides a natural\nmetric of the \"permeability\" of information systems, guiding towards the identification of\nthe underlying mechanisms. Second, it offers a common basis, or currency, to compare a\nlarge variety of heterogeneous events involving many different types of organizations.\nID loss event data have been thoroughly collected by several independant organizations.\nWe use the most complete dataset from the Open Security Foundation [2], that contains\n956 documented events reported mainly in the USA between year 2000 and November 2008.\nThe catalog provides also the involved organization, the date and amount of loss (measured\nas the numbers of ID stolen). Data are homogeneously sampled among various types of\norganizations: business (35%), education (30%), governments (24%) and medical institutions\n(10%). We define an event following the procedure described in Ref.[2, 11]. For instance,\nthe largest entries in the data set are (i) the discovery and disclosure of an attack over\nseveral years of the TJX Companies with a probable exposition of more than 90 millions\n\n3\n\n\fIDs (end of the event: January 2007), (ii) the Cardsystems' hack impacting 40 million\nVisa, MasterCard and American Express cardholders (June 2005), (iii) America Online (30\nmillion credit card ID exposed in 2004), and (iv) the U.S. Department of Veterans Affair\n(more than 25 million of ID stolen in 2006). While there is not warranty of completeness, our\ntests below suggest that the catalog of the Open Security Foundation provides a reasonable\nrepresentative sample of the overall activity of ID thefts occurring on the Internet.\n\nB.\n\nTransition from explosive growth to statistical stationarity\n\nThe total rate C(t) of ID theft events (measured by the number of events in a sliding\nwindow of 50 days) is shown in the top panel of Figure 1 as a function of time. This panel\nreveals the existence of two distinct phases. Starting from 2000, one can observe a dramatic\nincrease of the rate of attacks up to a peak reached in July 2006, followed by a plateau\nthereafter. The inset shows a simple non-parametric test suggesting that the first regime was\ncharacterized by a faster-than-exponential growth. Such singular behavior characterized by\na transient explosive growth mathematically modeled by a power law finite-time singularity\nis the diagnostic of an impending change of regime [12, 13, 14], which we indeed observe\nbeyond the peak in July 2006. This suggests to interpret the time evolution of the rate of\nID loss events as first undergoing a non-sustainable growth followed by a maturity period\nwhich characterizes the present epoch.\nThe lower panel of Figure 1 demonstrates that the distribution pdf(V ) of event sizes\n(defined as the total number of ID stolen in that event) has remained stable, within statistical\nfluctuations, over the whole time period investigated here from 2000 to Nov. 2008. There\nis no significant difference between the probability density functions (PDF) in the growth\nregime before July 2006 (red circles) and during the maturity period (blue diamonds), as\nevidenced by the perfect collapse of the PDFs. Indeed, Q-Q plots of one sample as a function\nof other samples and in function of the entire sample, were found to be approximately linear\nwith slope slope \u2248 0.9 \u00b1 0.3. This suggests that the mechanism underlying the loss of ID\nhas remained stable, notwithstanding the enormous evolutions that have occurred over this\nwhole time period.\nThe two pieces of information provided by the two panels of Figure 1 imply that the rate\n\n4\n\n\fN(V, t) of events of size V occurring at time t can be factorized under the form\nN(V, t) = C(t) * pdf(V ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C(t) and pdf(V ) constitute two independent contributors to cyber-risks. The macrovariable C(t) embodies the overall evolution of the level of threat associated with ID losses.\nIn other words, it provides a metric quantifying the systemic \"state of insecurity\" of the\nInternet. In contrast, pdf(V ) measures the relative frequency of large versus small ID losses.\nWhile the rate of attacks has varied enormously between 2000 and 2008 as shown by the\nbehavior of C(t) in the upper panel of Figure 1, the relative frequencies of various event sizes\nhas remained remarkably stable, as shown in the lower panel of Figure 1. We now turn to\nthe determination of pdf(V ) in order to characterize quantitatively the level of cyber risks\nper event.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF ID THEFT EVENT SIZES AND CONSEQUENCES\nPower-Law versus Stretched Exponential\n\nGiven the result of the previous section that a unique distribution pdf(V ) is sufficient\nto describe the frequency of event sizes in all time windows from 2000 to 2008, we now\ndetermine pdf(V ) by using the largest possible statistical sample including all events of this\nperiod. Figure 2 presents the (non-normalized) empirical survival (also called complementary cumulative) distribution function F\u0304u (V ), defined as the probability that the number of\nvictims in a given event is larger than or equal to V in the range V \u2265 u. Note that F\u0304u (V )\nhas a shape similar to the PDFs shown in the lower panel of Figure 1 with an approximately\nstraight tail in this double-logarithmic scale, suggesting a power law distribution\nu\nF\u0304u (V ) =\nV\n\u0012\n\n\u0013b\n\n, for V \u2265 u .\n\n(2)\n\nThis power law (2) is observed over more than three decades above the lower threshold u \u2248\n7.104 . A maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the exponent determines b = 0.7 \u00b1 0.1.\nIf model (2) is a correct description of the survival distribution, then pdf(V ) \u223c 1/V 1+b ,\nwhich is shown as a straight line with slope \u22121.7 in the lower panel of Figure 1. This result\nsuggests that ID thefts have statistics similar to those observed in the large class of systems\n5\n\n\fwith heavy-tails, such as firm and city sizes in the social sciences or earthquakes and other\ncalamities in the natural sciences.\nHowever, visual evidence and MLE are not sufficient to demonstrate that the power law\n(2) is adequate to describe our statistical data of ID thefts, as discussed in several earlier\nworks [15, 16, 17]. To prove that the one-parameter power law (2) is sufficient, we embed it\ninto a broader two-parameter law that have previously been reported to provide a flexible\nmodel of many empirical fat-tailed distribution [15] and perform a standard log-likelihood\nratio (Wilks) test. Specifically, we use the \"stretched exponential\" (SE) family\nuc\nVc\n+\nF\u0304u (V ) = exp \u2212\nd\nd\n!\n\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013#\n\n,\n\nfor V \u2265 u ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c and d are respectively the shape and scale parameters of the SE distribution. Malevergne et al. [17] have shown that the power law family (2) is asymptotically embedded in\nthis SE family in the limit\nc*\n\n\u0012 \u0013c\n\nu\nd\n\n\u2192 b, as c \u2192 0 .\n\n(4)\n\nThis has two practical applications: (i) the calibration of c and d for a given u provides an\nalternative determination (using (4) of the exponent b of the power law (2) if c is indeed\nsmall (typically less than 0.3); (ii) we can use the formal likelihood ratio test of embedded\nhypotheses which has been shown to hold for the power law seen as asymptotically embedded\nin the SE family [17, 18], to determine whether the one-parameter power law is sufficient or\na two-parameter distribution like the SE is necessary. Inset (a) in Fig 2 shows the estimated\nexponent b obtained from the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of c and d translated\ninto b via the equation bSE = c(u/d)c derived from (4), as a function of the lower threshold\nu. For u \u2265 7 * 104, we obtain an excellent confirmation of the value b \u2243 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 determined\nfrom the direct MLE of the power law (2). Inset (b) in Figure 2 shows in addition the\nlogarithm of the likelihood ratio (LLR) of the power law versus the SE fits: for u < 7 * 104 ,\nLLR< 0 indicating that the power law is not sufficient and that the SE is necessary; in\ncontrast, for u \u2265 7 * 104 , the power law is sufficient and the SE is not necessary, degenerating\ninto the power law as the condition (4) becomes valid.\n\n6\n\n\fB.\n\nEvidence for incompleteness of reported losses for small event sizes\n\nWe now discuss two possible hypotheses for the observed cross-over at u \u2248 7 * 104 below\nwhich the distributions shown in the lower panel of Figure 1 and in Figure 2 exhibit a\nsignificant downward curvature characterizing a deviation from the power law (2).\nA first possible interpretation is that this deviation from the power law reflects the fact\nthat hackers are preferentially targeting large organizations offering substantial potential\ngains. As a consequence, there would be practically no ID thefts involving only a few individuals. This hypothesis does not stand closer scrutiny: there is strong evidence that\nmillions of home computers are compromised [8] via the use of botnet deployment mechanisms centrally managed by pirates [7], with each computer infection being a unique event\npotentially leading to ID thefts limited to those IDs which are stored in the computer.\nAccording to Vinton Cerf's, 100 \u2212 150 millions computers over a total of 600 millions are\ncompromised[19]. As a rough estimation, assuming that all computers have about the same\nprobability of being infected and counting one computer per Internet user, this implies that\nabout one sixth of US computers are exposed. Thus, about 50 millions US citizen are constantly exposed to attacks targeting their own computer. Such events should thus provide\na huge population of small ID theft events' which is absent from even the most complete\ndataset of the Open Security Foundation [2].\n\nC.\n\nSuper-linear growth of the ID loss threat\n\nThere is another remarkable consequence deriving straightforwardly from the power law\n(2) with exponent b < 1. Indeed, the smallness of the power law exponent b < 1 implies\na typical faster-than-linear growth of cumulative losses with time. Because b < 1 and\nassuming that there are no upper threshold yet relevant, the mean and variance of the\nnumber of ID losses per event are mathematically infinite. In practice, this means that their\nvalues in any finite catalog exhibit growing random fluctuations as the number of recorded\nevents increases, due to the never decreasing influence of the largest event sizes. Then, the\ncumulative sum V(t) of all losses over all events up to time t is controlled by the few largest\nevents in the catalog [20]. This leads to a faster-than-linear growth\nV(t) \u223c t1/b \u2248 t1.4 .\n7\n\n(5)\n\n\fThis results is solely due to the statistical mechanism that, as more events occur, some are\nbound to explore more and more the tail of the heavy-tailed power law distribution (2).\nNote this law (5) constitutes a lower bound, which is attained only when the rate of event\noccurrences is itself not growing, as seems to be the case since July 2006.\nSuch faster-than-linear growths due to the pure statistical power law mechanism have\nbeen documented in natural hazards for losses caused by floods [21] and for the cumulative\nseismic energy released at regional scales [22] (see [20] for a detailed mathematical derivation\nand discussion). Given the heavy-tail nature of the distribution of ID theft numbers per\nevent, we should not be surprised that the Internet appears more and more insecure and\ndangerous, just as a result of this mechanism.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nIN CYBER-RISKS, SIZE MATTERS\nCross-sectional universality of ID losses\n\nWe have shown that the PDF of event sizes is constant over time. We now investigate\nwhether there exists some difference between the PDFs of event sizes in a cross-sectional\nanalysis of different sectors of activity, which could reveal different vulnerability characteristics.\nOur datasource uses four distinct sectors of activity: publicly traded companies (Biz),\nschools and universities (Edu), governmental agencies (Gov), and medical services (Med).\nDistinct regulations and industry benchmarking imply that organizations implement homogenous security processes in a given sector, but these security processes operating in a\ngiven sector are different from those in a different sector. A priori, one could expect that\ndistinct factors acting in these different sectors imply dissimilar attractiveness to hackers\nleading to different levels of vulnerability, which should be revealed in the statistical properties of the catalogs of ID losses. In contradiction with this anticipation, the top panel of\nFigure 3 shows that one cannot reject the hypothesis that the PDFs of ID loss size per event\nare identical for the four sectors Biz, Edu, Gov, Med.\nIf two typical organizations belonging to two different sectors are subjected to distinct\nexposition and permeability threats, the remarkable conclusion suggested by the top panel\nof Figure 3 is that the associated level of security just compensates for the increasing threat,\n\n8\n\n\fputting all organizations at a similar overall risk level. This result is reminiscent of the\neffect documented in Refs.[23, 24], that systems exposed to different distributions of attacks\nconverge to similar level of vulnerabilities when they try to optimize their efficiency in the\npresence of constraints. This could mean that organizations, which are indeed attempting\nto optimize their defenses against cyber-risks, may have already reached an intrinsic barrier.\nWith the evolving nature of the threats and given the complexity of the associated processes\nin the presence of limited resources, the observed level of ID losses may be a robust dynamical\nequilibrium that will be difficult to improve upon. This suggests that, in absence of a\nfundamentally new qualitative paradigm, these cyber-risks are bound to remain with us for\nthe foreseeable future.\n\nB.\n\nSize effects of vulnerabilities to cyber-risks\n\nThe bottom panel of Figure 3 plots the PDFs of victims per event sorted by target\norganization sizes. There are several possible measures for the size of an organization. Here,\nwe take the number of employees, which correlated well with other measures [25]. The PDFs\nare constructed for 269 universities [26] and 105 publicly traded companies [27]. The good\ncollapse of the PDFs confirms the universality of the power law distribution of event loss\nsizes, as in Fig.1 and Fig. 2.\nHowever, the tails of the PDFs are truncated at upper values which seem to grow with\nthe organization sizes. This size effect is better revealed by the scatter plot of the inset in\nthe bottom panel of Figure 3, which shows that the largest losses Vmax for a given range of\norganization sizes S seem to grow with S. This visual impression is confirmed by performing\nlinear regressions of log V (q) as a function of log S, log V (q) = \u03c3 log S + \u01eb, where V (q) is the\n99% quantile of the losses for a given organization size S. We find a stable determination\nof the exponent \u03c3 \u2248 1.3 \u00b1 0.1. This means that the largest losses for a given set of entities\nof size S grow with S as Vmax \u223c S \u03c3 \u2248 S 1.3 .\nNaively, one would have expected a linear growth with \u03c3 = 1. The faster-than-linear\nlaw may express a combination of effects, which include a faster-than-linear growth of the\nnumber of IDs stored in a given entity as a function of its number of employees, a bigger\nexposition that makes the attacks of large entities more attractive to hackers and possibly a\ngreater vulnerability due to more bridges or \"boundaries\" with the external world which are\n9\n\n\fmore difficult to manage. The faster-than-linear law is characteristic of a size effect which\nis similar to the size effects documented for instance in material failure [28] and species\nfragility [29].\nWe now show how \u03c3 is related to the exponent b of the PDFs of event loss sizes defined\nin (2). For this, we write the probability Pr(ID losses \u2265 V ) to find an event with more than\nV ID losses as\nPr(ID losses \u2265 V ) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\nSmin\n\ndS * Z(S) * Pr1 (ID losses \u2265 V |S) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Smin is a minimum size for an organization to be viable, and Z(S) is the distribution of\norganization sizes, well-known to follow Zipf's law (Z(S) \u223c 1/S 1+\u03bc with \u03bc \u2248 1) [25, 30, 31]\nso that Z(S) * dS is the number of organizations with sizes between S and S + dS. Moreover,\nPr1 (ID losses \u2265 V |S) is the probability to find an event with more than V ID losses in a\ngiven organization of size S. We know one property of Pr1 (ID losses \u2265 V |S), namely that\nit drops abruptly to vanishing values for V > C * S \u03c3 , where C is a positive constant, as\ndocumented above. This implies that, for a fixed V , all integrants with S < (V /C)1/\u03c3 do\nnot contribute to the integral. Motivated by the power law (2), we also assume a power law\nshape for Pr1 (ID losses \u2265 V |S) with exponent b1 . Putting all this together, expression (6)\nbecomes\nPr(ID losses \u2265 V ) \u2243\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nSmin (V )\n\n1\ndS\n*\n,\nS 1+\u03bc S b1\n\n(7)\n1\n\nwith Smin(V ) \u223c (V /C)1/\u03c3 . This yields Pr(ID losses \u2265 V ) \u223c 1/S b1 + \u03c3 +(\u03bc\u22121) . Identifying this\npower law with (2) in the tail gives b = b1 +\n\n1\n\u03c3\n\n+ (\u03bc \u2212 1). Given that \u03c3 \u2248 1.3 \u00b1 0.1, we\n\nhave 1/\u03c3 \u2248 0.77 \u00b1 0.1. Since b = 0.7 \u00b1 0.1, this calculation allows us to infer that the\ndistribution of ID losses for a given organization is fairly flat (b1 \u2243 0). In other words, the\nefforts necessary to get just a few or a large number of IDs are not much different, once an\norganization has been compromised. Our conclusion does not rely sensitively on the validity\nof Zipf's law. However, the value b < 1 imposes a bound on the exponent \u03bc of Zipf's law\nwhich cannot be significantly larger than 1.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented three different tests that confirm the general validity and robustness\nof the probability distribution of ID losses per event (where ID losses has been taken as\n10\n\n\fa proxy for information risks on the Internet). We showed that the PDFs are the same\nirrespective of (i) the growth phase before July 2006 versus stationary regime thereafter,\n(ii) the sectors of activity, and (iii) the size of targeted organisations. Returning to the\nquestions raised in the introduction, it is striking and a priori counter intuitive to find that all\norganisations are evenly vulnerable, whatever their implemented information security. This\nraises important questions concerning the tradeoff between exposition and counter-measures\nin the complex evolving landscape of cyber-risks. The consequences on the evolution of the\nInternet remain to be studied. This present paper provides a first partial approach of the\nstudy of the development of the Internet and of cyber-risks taking into account their intricate\nentanglement.\nWe have shown the existence of a size effect, such that the largest possible ID losses per\nevent grow faster-than-linearly with the organization size. This has led us to derive two\nimportant consequences. First, the small value b \u2243 0.7 of the power law distribution of\nID thefts is explained by interplay between Zipf's law and the size effect. Second, we have\nfound indirect evidence that compromised entities typically expose to hackers a small or large\nnumber of IDs with basically the same frequency. This inference is very important for the\nquantification of cyber risks and suggests that counter-measures should be targeted towards\nbuilding internal barriers, avoiding the \"Titanic\" effect of inadequate compartmentalization.\n\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the Swiss National Foundation, grant\n2-77059-07 and by the MTEC Foundation (Fordergesellschaft fur Betriebswissenschaften\nMTEC), We also acknowledge financial support from the ETH Competence Center \"Coping\nwith Crises in Complex Socio-Economic Systems\" (CCSS) through ETH Research Grant\nCH1-01-08-2.\n\n11\n\n\f[1] Hamilton G Viruses (2008), The unsung heroes of evolution, New Scientist, 2671, 38-41.\n[2] datalossdb, http://datalossdb.org/ (06.01.2009)\n[3] Frei S, May M, Fiedler U, Plattner B (2006), Large Scale Vulnerability Analysis, ACM SIGCOMM 2006 Workshop.\n[4] Zittrain J (2008) The Future of the Internet\u2013And How to Stop It?
