The possible Lie algebras for the conformal group\nand corresponding canonical line-elements are explicitly given. It turns out that\nonly four different cases appear, the abelian and other three called I, II and III.\nWe explicitly find all the solutions in the abelian and I cases. For the abelian case\nthe general solution depends on an arbitrary function of a single variable and the\nperfect fluid satisfies the equation of state \u03c1 = p+const. This class of metrics is\nthe one presented recently by one of us. The general solution for case I is a new\nPetrov type D metric, with the velocity vector outside the 2-space spanned by\nthe two principal null directions and a barotropic equation of state \u03c1 + 3p = 0.\nFor the cases II and III, the general solution has been found only under the\nfurther assumption of a natural separation of variables Ansatz.

This solution has the previously unknown\ncurious property that both commuting Killing vectors are timelike everywhere.\n\n\u2217\n\nAlso at Laboratori de F\u0131\u0301sica Matem\u00e0tica, IEC, Barcelona.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis contribution deals with stationary and axisymmetric differentially rotating perfectfluid solutions of the Einstein field equations admitting a conformal Killing vector field.\nIn order to handle the non-linear partial differential Einstein equations, several special assumptions are usually made to simplify the problem: Petrov type, irrotational\nfluids, non-isometrical symmetries. One of these mathematical simplifications is the\nconformal symmetry. Conformal symmetries play an important role in the case of\nperfect-fluid solutions of the Einstein field equations in the stationary and axisymmetric case. In fact, among the very few known exact solutions under such conditions, two\nimportant families possess a conformal Killing vector: a family with rigid rotation and\nPetrov type D, depending on three parameters [1], and a large family depending on an\narbitrary function with differential rotation and Petrov type D [2], which includes the\nprevious family as its rigidly rotating limit, both found by one of us.\nAn attempt to classify all known exact solutions with a conformal symmetry has\nbeen recently done by J. Castej\u00f3n-Amenedo & A.A. Coley [3] without restricting to\nany particular matter contents of the space-time. The general case of perfect-fluid\nstationary and axisymmetric exact solutions in the case of rigid rotation has been\nconsidered in the last few years in some papers by D. Kramer [4],[5] and D. Kramer & J.\nCarot [6]. The first paper is restricted to the case in which the conformal Killing vector\ncommutes with both the two Killing vectors, or equivalently, due to the orthogonal\ntransitivity of the space-time, to the case in which the conformal Killing is orthogonal\nto both the Killing vectors. It is found in this paper that the only exact solutions\nunder these assumptions are the Schwarzschild interior solution which is static and\nconformally flat, a more symmetric solution belonging to Herlt's class and the general\ntype D solution with the fluid vector lying in the two-plane generated by the two\nrepeated null directions of the Weyl tensor [1]. The second paper by D. Kramer [5]\nconsiders the situation in which the commutation of the conformal Killing vector with\neach of the Killing vectors is an arbitrary linear combination of the Killings (without\ncomponent in the conformal Killing vector itself). The main result in this paper is\nthat no solution of the Einstein field equations for a perfect-fluid energy-momentum\ntensor exists under the assumptions above. Finally, in the third mentioned paper by D.\nKramer & J. Carot [6] the remaining case in which at least one of the Lie derivatives of\nthe conformal Killing vector along the Killing vectors has a non-vanishing component\nin the conformal Killing vector itself is studied. The result is again that no non-static\nsolutions for perfect fluids exist under these hypotheses.\nOur aim in this paper is to generalize these results on rigid rotation to the more\ngeneral case of differentially rotating perfect fluids by finding out all the exact perfectfluid solutions arising when a conformal motion is added to the stationary and axial\nsymmetry in the space-time. The amount of work that represents to consider the\nfourteen inequivalent three-dimensional Lie algebras arising when the orbits of one of\n2\n\n\fthe generators are closed is substantially restricted due to a recent result by the authors\n[7] which states that in an axially symmetric space-time (stationary or not) a conformal\nKilling vector must necessarily commute with the axial Killing vector whenever no more\nconformal symmetry exists in the space-time. This result is purely geometric and does\nnot depend on orthogonal transitivity or any matter contents of the space-time. Using\nthis result, it turns out that only four inequivalent conformal Lie algebras are allowed,\nthe abelian case and three other cases called in this paper I, II and III.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In the second section the four different allowed\nLie algebras are established and the canonical forms of the metric, as well as the\nexplicit form of the conformal Killing vector in these coordinates are given in each\nof the four cases. The Einstein field equations for a perfect-fluid energy-momentum\ntensor involving only the components of the Einstein tensor are also written down in\nthis section.\nIn the third section the abelian case is exhausted. The main result in this section is\nthat the general solution of a differentially rotating perfect fluid (including rigid rotation as a limit case) with a conformal motion is, apart from the Schwarzschild interior\nsolution, the type D solution with an arbitrary function depending on a single variable\nand equation of state \u03c1 = p+const recently presented by one of us [2]. This solution\nwas found under completely different hypotheses involving mainly some conditions on\nthe Weyl tensor and it turned out to have a conformal motion.\nThe fourth section is devoted to the case I and again the general solution in this\ncase is found. Besides some static solutions we do not explicitly consider and the\nSchwarzschild interior solution, the general solution in this case is given by a new differentially rotating type D metric with the velocity vector outside the 2-space spanned\nby the two principal null directions and barotropic equation of state \u03c1 + 3p = 0. Its\nrigid rotation limit is static (as it must be because no solutions in the rigidly rotating\ncase were found in the papers mentioned above).\nIn the fifth section the case II is considered. In this case, however, the general\nsolution is found only under the additional assumption of a separation of variables\nAnsatz which is strongly indicated by the two previous sections. The general solution\nunder this condition is, in fact, homothetic and has no barotropic equation of state\nunless for a new type D solution with \u03c1 + 3p = 0. This solution cannot be interpreted\nas an axially symmetric space-time and the fluid velocity vector is proportional to one\nof the Killing vectors (so that the solution is in some sense rigid) but it is included\nhere because it shows the interesting feature that both Killing vectors are timelike\neverywhere (obviously, at any point in the space-time there exists a linear combination\nof them which is spacelike, but this cannot be done globally). This solution was\npreviously unknown, even though it belongs to a \"rigid\" case which was extensively\ntreated in [5].\nFinally, in the sixth section the remaining case III is treated. As in the previous\nsection, the general solution in this case is found only under the separation of variables\n3\n\n\fAnsatz. The general solution turns out to be again homothetic and no particular case\nof them has a barotropic equation of state.\n\n2\n\nCanonical Forms of the Metric\n\nA recent result due to the authors [7] states that the mere existence of a regular\nsymmetry axis for the axial symmetry restricts severely the Bianchi type of the threedimensional Lie algebra generated by the Killing vector fields and the conformal Killing\nvector field. In fact, it is proven that the axial Killing vector ~\u03b7 must commute with\nboth the timelike Killing \u03be~ and the conformal Killing vector ~k. So we have necessarily\nh\n\ni\n\nh\n\n~ ~\u03b7 = ~0,\n\u03be,\n\ni\n\n~k, ~\u03b7 = ~0,\n\nwhile the commutation relation between the timelike Killing and the conformal Killing\n~ ~\u03b7 and ~k with constant coefficients.\nis an arbitrary linear combination of \u03be,\nIt can be easily seen that only four non-isomorphic Lie algebras are possible under\nthese conditions. They can be written as\nh\n\ni\n\nh\n\ni\n\n~ ~k = ~0,\n\u03be,\n\nAbelian Case\n\nh\n\ni\n\n~ ~k = b~k,\n\u03be,\n\nCase I\n\n(1)\n\n~ ~k = b\u03be,\n~\n\u03be,\n\nCase II\n\nh\n\ni\n\n~ ~k = b~\u03b7 ,\n\u03be,\n\nCase III\n\nwhere b is an arbitrary non-vanishing constant, which can still be set equal to one.\nHowever, this constant has dimensions and we will not fix it to any specified value.\nSince the two Killing vector fields commute, there always exist coordinates t, \u03c6\noutside the axis of symmetry such that these vector fields are written as \u03be~ = \u2202t and\n~\u03b7 = \u2202\u03c6 . Moreover, we are interested in non-convective rotating perfect fluids and then\nthere also exist coordinates x and y in which the metric line-element decomposes into\ntwo orthogonal blocks (theorem of Papapetrou). For an account of the above results\nand definitions, see for instance [8]. We can always diagonalise the x, y block and write\nthe metric in these coordinates as\n\"\n\n1\n\u2212F (x, y) dt + P (x, y)d\u03c6\nds = 2\n\u03a8 (x, y)\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n#\n\nQ2 (x, y) 2\nd\u03c6 + dx2 + dy 2 ,\n+\nF (x, y)\n\nwhere F (x, y) must be a positive function. Until now we have not restricted this metric\nto have a conformal symmetry. Imposing the conformal Killing equations\nL~k g\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2207\u03b1 k\u03b2 + \u2207\u03b2 k\u03b1 = 2\u03a6g\u03b1\u03b2\n4\n\n\fin the coordinates {t, \u03c6, x, y}, we can restrict the form of the line-element to the following four forms depending on the Bianchi type of the Lie algebra.\nAbelian Case\n1\nds = 2\n\u03a8 (x, y)\n2\n\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212 F (x) dt + P (x)d\u03c6\n\n\u00132\n\n#\n\nQ2 (x) 2\nd\u03c6 + dx2 + dy 2 ,\n+\nF (x)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a8 is the only function which depends on y.

As a consequence\nof this equation, the dependence of the function \u03a8(x, y) on the variable y must be\nnon-trivial because, otherwise, we would have more proper isometries than the initially\nconsidered.\nWe are interested in non-convective perfect-fluid solutions of the Einstein field equations in the general case of differential rotation. The energy-momentum tensor is then\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03c1 + p) u\u03b1 u\u03b2 + pg\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nwhere \u03c1 stands for the energy density, p for the pressure of the fluid and the fluid\nvector ~u lies in the two-plane generated by the two Killing vector fields \u03be~ and ~\u03b7. In\nconsequence, the fluid one-form is a linear combination of the coordinate forms dt and\nd\u03c6 at each point of the space-time.\nWe will write the Einstein field equations in orthonormal tetrads {\u03b8 \u03b1} chosen in\nsuch a way that the fluid one-form u always lies on the two-plane spanned by \u03b8 0 and\n\u03b8 1 in each point.

These solutions, however, are\nnot perfect-fluid solutions of Einstein's field equations because their Einstein's tensors\ndo not have any timelike eigenvector. This type of solutions can arise because in the\nquadratic equation (7) some non-perfect fluid solutions are included.\nSubcase a2)\nLet us now look at the subcase in which\ng \u2032 g \u2032\u2032\n\nQ\u2032\n2\n2\n\u2212 g \u2032\u2032 + \u01eba2 g \u2032 = 0.\nQ\n\n(16)\n\nIn this case, equation (14) gives after dropping a factor g \u20322\nQ\u2032\u2032\n+ 4\u01eba2 = 0,\nQ\nwhich simplifies notably the equation (12) to give\nF 2P \u2032\nQ\n\n!\u2032\n\n!\n\nQ\u2032\n,\n= \u03c3 F \u2032\u2032 \u2212 F \u2032\nQ\n\nwhere \u03c3 is a sign.

In order to satisfy the two remaining equations (13) and (14),\nwe must distinguish between two cases depending on whether g \u2032\u2032 vanishes or not. If\ng \u2032\u2032 = 0 we have that the constants a and c vanish. The condition (16) is identically\nsatisfied, while equations (13) and (14) give only Q\u2032\u2032 = 0.

Using this expression for Q it is immediate to see\nthat the equations (13) (14) are identically satisfied and then the solution is given by\ng \u2032\u2032 = \u2212\u01eba2 g,\n\n\u1e27 = \u01eba2 h,\n\nQ = Q0 g \u2032 g \u2032\u2032,\n\nF \u2032 = \u03b1Q,\n\nF 2P \u2032\n= \u03b2,\nQ\n\nwhere the constants are restricted, as before, to satisfy the algebraic relation (17).\nThese two solutions are seen to be conformally flat and therefore, they both are the\nSchwarzschild interior solution with constant density [9].\nCase g \u2032 = 0.\nIn the case when g \u2032 = 0, the constant g can be set equal to zero by adding it\nto the function h. Thus, equations (13) and (14) are trivially satisfied and there\nonly remain two differential equations to be satisfied by the three functions F, Q and\nP . In consequence we have a general family of differentially rotating perfect-fluid\nsolutions which depend on an arbitrary function.

This\nfamily of solutions is a differentially rotating generalization of a rigid solution due to\none of us [1] and was found by the same author [2] as the more general stationary and\naxisymmetric non-convective and differentially rotating perfect-fluid solution satisfying\nthe following assumptions:\n(i) Petrov type D,\n(ii) The velocity vector lies in the two-plane spanned by the two repeated principal\nnull directions of the Weyl tensor.\n(iii) The Weyl tensor has vanishing magnetic part with respect to the fluid velocity\nvector.\nThis family of solutions has equation of state p = \u03c1+const. and belong to the case\nD1DR in the classification scheme of [8]. We have therefore proven that this family\nof solutions, together with the Schwarzschild interior solution are the only stationary\naxisymmetric non-convective perfect-fluid solutions which admit a three-dimensional\nabelian conformal group with one proper conformal Killing vector.\n\n4\n\nCase I\n\nIn this case the line-element can be cast into the form (3) from which the following\northonormal tetrad can be read\n\u03b80 =\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\nbMdt, \u03b8 1 = L d\u03c6 + bNdt , \u03b8 2 = dx, \u03b8 3 = dy.\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nTwo of the Einstein field equations read in this case\nS23 = 2\u03a8\u03a8,xy = 0,\n!\n\nL\n1\n= \u2212\u03a8\n\u03a8 + 2\u03a8,yy \u2212 2\u03a8,xx \u2212 \u03b1\u03a8 + \u03c9 2 L2 \u03a8 = 0.\nL\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n\nS22 \u2212 S33\n\nSo, as in the previous case, the function \u03a8 splits into the sum of a function of x and a\nfunction of y\n\u03a8(x, y) = g(x) + h(y),\nwhich are explicitly known because they are the solutions of the ordinary differential\nequations\ng \u2032\u2032 = \u2212\u01eba2 g + c,\n\n\u1e27 = \u01eba2 h + c,\n11\n\n\fwhile the function L(x) satisfies the differential equation\n1\nL\u2032\u2032\n\u2212 \u03b1 + 2\u01eba2 + \u03c9 2 L2 = 0.\nL\n2\nUsing these relations, the remaining field equation (7) is\n!\n\n\u1e40\n\u22122 \u1e23 + 2\u1e27\nM\n\n!\n\nL\u2032\n1\n1\n2 g \u2032 \u2212 2g \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c9 2 L2 g \u2212 \u03c9 2 L2 h \u2212 \u1e232 \u03c9 2 L2 = 0.\nL\n2\n2\n\n(18)\n\nIn the case that the constant \u03c9 vanishes, the function N is a constant that can be set\nequal to zero by redefining the axial variable. In consequence, it is obvious from the\nform of the metric that these solutions are static, and we are not interested in them in\nthis paper. Thus, we can restrict ourselves to the case \u03c9 6= 0.

In terms of this function, equation (20) can be integrated to\ngive\nM = k0 H \u1e22,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere k0 is the constant of integration.\nUsing relation (21), it can be seen that the differential equation \u1e40 2 = 1 + \u03b1M 2 is\nsatisfied by the function (22) if and only if\n\u03b1 = 4\u01eba2 ,\n\n\u01eba2 \u03bd + c = 0,\n\nk02 H02 = 1.\n\nTherefore, we can define a function G(x) by G \u2261 g + \u03bd, so that \u03a8 = G + H and G is\nthe solution of the equation\nG\u2032\u2032 = \u2212\u01eba2 G.\n\n12\n\n(23)\n\n\fThe field equations are written in terms of G as\n!\n\n\u03c92\nL G + LG \u01eba \u2212 L2 = 0,\n4\n!\n2\n\u03c9 2\n2\n\u2032\u2032\nL \u2212 \u01eba = 0.\nL + 2L\n4\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nFrom these two equations it follows immediately the relation\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n2L\u2032 G\u2032 + GL\u2032\u2032 = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 L\u2032 G2 = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 L\u2032 G2 = \u03b4,\nwhere \u03b4 is constant.

Consequently, we must\n\u03c92\nhave \u01eb = 1 and the solution is given by\nL=\n\n2a\n,\n\u03c9\n\n2\n\n\u1e22 2 = a2 H 2 + H0 ,\n\nG\u2032 = \u2212a2 G2 + G0 ,\n\nM=\n\nH \u1e22\n.\nH0\n\nUnder these conditions the metric (3) becomes conformally flat and therefore this\nsolution is again Schwarzschild interior.\nq\n\u2032\nIn the second case, when \u03b4 6= 0, we have G = \u03c3 L\u03b4 , where \u03c3 is a sign. Equation\n(23) for G reads now, in terms of L\n2L\u2032\u2032\u2032 L\u2032\u2032 2\n\u2212 \u2032 2 + 4\u01eba2 = 0,\nL\u2032\nL\nwhich can be seen incompatible with (25) unless a = 0 and \u03c9 = 0, against hipotheses.\nThus, no solutions exist in this subcase.\nIt only remains the study of the third case, when G = 0. In this situation, the\nfunction L satisfies only the differential equation (25) which has a first integral\n\u03c92 4\nL \u2212 2\u01eba L + L \u2212 L0 = 0,\n4\n\u20322\n\n2\n\n2\n\nwhere L0 is a constant of integration. From (4) and (22) we obtain the function N\n1\nN = \u03c9k0 H 2 + N0 ,\n2\nwhere N0 is a constant of integration. This constant can be set equal to zero redefining\nthe axial coordinate by\n\u03c6 + bN0 t \u2192 \u03c6,\n13\n\n(26)\n\n\fwhich does not change the form of the axial Killing vector field (~\u03b7 = \u2202\u03c6 ). Recalling\n2\nthat M\n= k02 \u1e22 2 , defining a new constant \u03b2 = bk0 , redefining \u03c92 \u2192 \u03c9, renaming L to\nH2\nX and performing the change of variables\ndx = \u221a\n\n2\u01eba2 X 2\n\ndX\n,\n\u2212 \u03c9 2 X 4 + L0\n\nthe metric (3) is written finally as\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nds = \u2212\u03b2 \u1e22 dt + X\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n1\nd\u03c6 + \u03b2\u03c9Hdt\nH\n\n+\n\ndy 2\ndX 2\n+\n, (27)\nH 2 (2\u01eba2 X 2 \u2212 \u03c9 2X 4 + L0 ) H 2\n\nwhere H(y) is explicitly known because is the solution of\n\u1e26 = \u01eba2 H.\nThe fluid velocity vector is given by\n1\n\n~u = q\n\u03b2 \u1e22 2 \u2212 H 2 \u03c9 2 X 2\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 2\u03b2\u03c9H 2\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n!\n\nand therefore this solution is a differentially rotating perfect-fluid solution with the\nrotation \u03a9 given by\n\u03a9 = \u22122\u03b2\u03c9H 2.\nThe pressure and energy density of this solution are given by\np = \u1e22 2 \u2212 H 2\u03c9 2 X 2 ,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c1 = \u22123 \u1e22 2 \u2212 H 2 \u03c9 2X 2 ,\n\nso that they are related by the equation of state \u03c1 + 3p = 0. Unluckily, no known\nmatter is described by such an equation of state.\nThis solution is Petrov type D and its principal null directions are given by\nl1 = \u03b2 \u1e22dt +\n\n1\ndy,\nH\n\nl2 = \u03b2 \u1e22dt \u2212\n\n1\ndy.\nH\n\nWe see that the fluid velocity vector does not lie in the two-plane generated by the\ntwo principal null directions and thus, this solution belongs to the class D2DR in the\nclassification scheme of [8]. As far as we know, this is the first solution found in that\ncase. It has a regular symmetry axis provided that L0 = 1 and its static limit can be\ntrivially obtained by setting \u03c9 = 0. We conclude that this solution is, apart from static\ncases, the only stationary and axisymmetric non-convective perfect-fluid solution with\na three-dimensional (proper) conformal group with Lie algebra given by case I in (1).\n14\n\n\f5\n\nCase II\n\nTo write the metric (5) corresponding to this case we choose the orthonormal cobasis\ngiven by\n\u0011\n1\n1 Q\n1\n1 \u221a \u0010 \u2212by\nF e dt + P d\u03c6 , \u03b8 1 = \u221a d\u03c6, \u03b8 2 = dx, \u03b8 3 = dy.\n\u03b80 =\n\u03a8\n\u03a8 F\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\nWe will not consider the situation when the function P (x) vanishes because this corresponds to the well-known static case.

Therefore, in this paper we will restrict ourselves to\na particular solution of these equations. The Ansatz is suggested by the previous cases\nand it consists in the separation of \u03a8(x, y) as a sum of a function of x and a function\nof y. That is, we will assume in this section the restrictive Ansatz given by\n\u03a8(x, y) = g(x) + h(y).\n\n(30)\n\nThe first partial differential equation (28) is now simply\nP \u2032 P 2F 2 F \u2032\n+\n= 0.\nP Q2\nF\n\n(31)\n\nThe second equation (29) implies on the one hand the usual relations which determine\nthe functions g(x) and h(y)\ng \u2032\u2032 = \u2212\u01eba2 g + c,\n\n\u1e27 = \u01eba2 + c,\n\n(32)\n\nand on the other hand the ordinary differential equation\n1 Q\u2032\u2032 1 Q\u2032 F \u2032 1 P \u2032 2 F 2 P 2 1 F \u2032 2 b2 b2 P 2 F 2\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\n\u2212 \u01eba2 = 0.\n\u2212\n2 Q\n2 QF\n4 P 2 Q2\n4 F2\n2\n4 Q2\n15\n\n(33)\n\n\fSubstituting the expression for F \u2032 given in (31) into the relevant components of Einstein's tensor, we find\nS01\nS00 + S33\n\n!\n\nPF\nP\u2032\n= \u2212\u03a8\ng \u2032 + (g + h) Q(x) + b\u1e23 ,\nQ\nP\n\"\n#\n!\nP 2F 2 \u2032 P \u2032\ng\n+ (g + h) R(x) + 2\u1e27 + 2b\u1e23 ,\n= \u03a8\nQ2\nP\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nS11 \u2212 S22 = \u03a8 A(x)g + B(x) + A(x)h ,\nwhere R(x), A(x) and B(x) stand for the following expressions\n1 Q\u2032 P \u2032 P \u2032 2 P 2 F 2 1 P \u2032\u2032\n+ 2\n\u2212\n+ b2 ,\n2 QP\nP Q2\n2 P\n!\nP 2 F 2 3 Q\u2032 P \u2032 1 P \u2032\u2032 3 P \u2032 2 P 2 F 2 1 P \u20322 1 2\nA(x) \u2261\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+ b ,\nQ2\n2 QP\n2 P\n2 P 2 Q2\n2 P2\n2\n\u2032\n2 2\n\u2032\nP P F\nQ\n\u2212 2g \u2032\u2032.\nB(x) \u2261 2g \u2032 + g \u2032\nQ\nP Q2\nR(x) \u2261\n\nThen, the quadratic Einstein equation (7) takes the following form, after dropping a\nglobal factor \u03a8,\n\u03a31 (x)h2 + \u03a32 (x)h + \u03a33 (x) + \u03a34 (x)h\u1e23 + \u03a35 (x)\u1e23 = 0,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere we have used the relation\n\u1e232 = \u01eba2 h2 + 2ch + h0 ,\nwhich is a consequence of the differential equation (32) for h(y) and where h0 is a\nconstant. It is not difficult to see that equation (34) splits into the following three\nsubcases:\nb1) When \u1e27 = c with c non-vanishing or when a 6= 0 and h0 6= 0.\nb2) When \u1e23 = \u03b1 is a constant.\nb3) When \u1e23 = ah with a non-vanishing.\nSubcase b1)\nIn this case equation (34) can be seen equivalent to\n\u03a31 (x) = 0,\n\n\u03a32 (x) = 0,\n\nThe expression \u03a35 \u2212 g\u03a34 reads\n\n\u03a33 (x) = 0,\n\ng\u2032\n\nQ\u2032\n\u2212 g \u2032\u2032 = 0,\nQ\n16\n\n\u03a34 (x) = 0,\n\n\u03a35 (x) = 0.\n\n(35)\n\n\fwhich is identically satisfied if the function g is a constant. But we know that, in this\ncase, this constant could be absorved into the function h(y), so that we would have\n2 2\ng = 0 and then also \u03a33 (x) \u2261 \u2212 PQF2 b2 h0 = 0. But the constant c must vanish due to\nthe differential equation that the function g had to satisfy, so this equation would be\nincompatible with the hypothesis that h0 is non-vanishing. We must therefore assume\nthat g \u2032 6= 0. From (35) immediately follows Q(x) = \u03b2g \u2032 where \u03b2 is a constant and, as\na consequence, we have Q\u2032\u2032 = \u2212\u01eba2 Q. Using this formula, equation (33) together with\n2\n2 2\nthe expression for \u03a34 (x) gives PQF2 = 1 \u2212 \u01ebab2 from where it is very easy to see that no\nsolution of the system of differential equations exists in this subcase.\nSubcase b2)\nHere we have \u1e23 = \u03b1 and equation (34) splits into the three relations\n\u03a31 (x) = 0,\n\n\u03a32 (x) + \u03b1\u03a34 (x) = 0,\n\n\u03a33 (x) + \u03b1\u03a35 (x) = 0.\n\nUsing the fact that now the constants a and c vanish it is easily found that these three\nequations are, respectively\nP 2F 2\nR (A \u2212 R) = 0,\nQ2\n!\n!\nP 2F 2 P \u2032 \u2032\nP 2F 2\nP\u2032 \u2032\nA\ng + 2b\u03b1 +\nR B \u2212 2b\u03b1 \u2212 2 g = 0,\nQ2 P\nQ2\nP\n\u03a31 =\n\n!\n\nP 2F 2\nP 2F 2 P \u2032 \u2032\ng\n+\n2b\u03b1\n\u2212\nB\nQ2 P\nQ2\n\nP\u2032 \u2032\ng + b\u03b1\nP\n\n!2\n\n= 0.\n\n(36)\n\nFrom the form of \u03a31 we know that two different possibilities arise depending on which\nfactor vanishes. When the first factor vanishes but the second is different from zero it\nis straightforward to see from the form of the other two equations that\nP 2F 2\n=2\n(37)\nQ2\nwhich simplifies greatly the system of partial differential equations and allows us to\nsee easily that no solutions exist. When the second factor in \u03a31 vanishes but the first\none is not zero, it can be deduced the same relation (37) from the other two equations\nagain. This fact simplifies substantially the differential equations we are considering\nand the general solution of Einstein field equations in this case is given by\n\u221a Q\n\u03b1\n\u1e23 = \u03b1,\ng \u2032 = \u2212b ,\nP \u2032 = \u03b4P,\nQ\u2032 = \u2212\u03b4Q,\nF = 2 ,\nP\n\u03b4\nwhere \u03b4 is an arbitrary non-vanishing constant. It can be seen that this solution\npossesses a four-dimensional group of symmetries acting multiply transitively on threedimensional timelike hypersurfaces and therefore they have much more symmetry than\nthe initially considered.\n17\n\n\fFinally, in order to exhaust this subcase it remains to consider the possibility when\nboth factors in \u03a31 vanish. In this case it cannot be found a relation of the type (37)\nand the situation is more complicated. Therefore, in this case, the three functions\nQ(x), P (x) and F (x) must satisfy the five differential equations given by R(x) = 0,\nA(x) = 0, (31), (33) and (36). It is much more difficult to see that this system of differential equations is incompatible, but a rather long calculation involving appropriate\ncombinations of these equations and their derivatives allows finally to prove that no\nsolution exists in this subcase.\nSubcase b3)\nIn this subcase we have \u1e23 = ah and equation (34) gives the three equations\n\u03a31 (x) + a\u03a34 (x) = 0,\n\n\u03a32 (x) + a\u03a35 (x) = 0,\n\n\u03a33 (x) = 0,\n\nwhere now, taking into account that h0 and c vanish and \u01eb = 1, we have\n!\n\n!\n\nP 2F 2\nP\u2032 \u2032\nP\u2032 \u2032\n\u03a33 =\nRg\n+\nAg\n+\nB\n\u2212\nRg\n\u2212\ng\ng = 0,\nQ2\nP\nP\n!\n!\nP 2F 2\nP\u2032 \u2032\n2\nR + 2a + 2ab +\n\u03a32 + a\u03a35 = Ag + B \u2212 Rg \u2212 g\nP\nQ2\n!\n!\nP\u2032 \u2032\nP 2F 2\nP 2F 2\n+ Rg + g\n(A \u2212 R) \u2212 2ab 2 + 2ab + 2a2 = 0,\nP\nQ2\nQ\n!\n2 2\nP 2F 2\nP F\n2\nR\n+\n2a\n+\n2ab\n\u2212\n(R + ab)2 = 0.\n\u03a31 + a\u03a34 = A\nQ2\nQ2\n\n(38)\n\nWe now make an analysis similar to that made in the previous subcase. When the first\nfactor in \u03a33 vanishes but the second one is different from zero, it can be seen from the\nother two equations (which take a much simpler form) that, necessarily\nP 2F 2\na+b\n=2\n.\n2\nQ\nb\n\n(39)\n\nThis equation allows us to see after little effort that the system of five differential\nequations for the three functions P (x), Q(x) and F (x) is incompatible.\nWhen the second factor in \u03a33 vanishes while the first one is not zero, it can be\nfound again from the other two equations the relation (39). In this case, however, the\nsystem of equations has the general solution\n\u1e23 = ah,\n\ng \u2032\u2032 = \u2212a2 g,\n\nQ = Q0 ,\n\n18\n\nF =\n\nQ0\n,\nP\n\nb = \u22122a,\n\n\fwhere Q0 is a non-vanishing arbitrary constant and P (x) is an arbitrary positive function of x. This is not, however, a perfect-fluid solution of Einstein's field equations as\ncan be seen from the fact that its Einstein tensor does not have a timelike eigenvector.\nFinally, we need to consider the situation when both factors in \u03a33 vanish. As in\nthe previous subsection, this is the most difficult case because no relation of type (39)\ncan be extracted directly from the other two equations. After a long calculation which\ninvolves the third relation in (38) as well as the equations (31), (33) together with\nthe vanishing of both factors in brackets of \u03a33 , it can be proven that there only exists\nsolution when the function g is a constant.

Therefore, this solution is not axially symmetric.\nIn consequence, the coordinate \u03c6 is not an angle variable and we will replace it for T .\nPerforming the change of variables given by\ndx = q\n\u03b42 \u2212\n\ndX\na2 X 2\n\u03b22\n\n(X 2 \u2212 2\u03b2 2 )\n\n,\n\n1\nY = e\u2212ay\na\n\nwhere \u03b4 is an arbitary constant, the metric line-element takes the final form\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b2 2 X 2\naY dT +\ndt\nds = 2 2 dt \u2212\naY\n\u03b1\u03b2\naY\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\na2 Y 2 dX 2\n+ 2 a2 X 2\n+ dY 2 .\n2\n2\n\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2 2 (X \u2212 2\u03b2 )\n\n(42)\n\nEven though the two Killing vector fields of this solution, \u2202T and \u2202t , are timelike\neverywhere, there obviously exists a linear combination of them which is spacelike\nat any point of the spacetime . However, no Killing vector in this solution is globally\nspacelike. In the study of the exact solutions with a two-dimensional group of isometries\nacting on timelike surfaces, the starting point is usually to assume a timelike and a\nspacelike Killing vector (see [9]). While this is obviously true locally, the previous\nsolution shows that sometimes it might be interesting to consider two different timelike\nKilling vectors form the very beginning in order to find some of the exact solutions\nwith a G2 acting on T2 .

Although Kramer [4] studied the general solution of Einstein's\nfield equations admitting two commuting Killing vectors and a conformal Killing vector\nwith the Lie algebra given in case II and with the velocity vector proportional to one\nof the Killings, he surprisingly did not find this solution we have just presented.\nWe have therefore found the most general solution of non-convective stationary\nand axisymmetric perfect-fluid metrics admitting a three-dimensional proper conformal\ngroup generated by a Lie algebra of type II in (1) only for the case when the Ansatz\nof separation of variables (30) holds. The general case will be treated elsewhere.\n\n6\n\nCase III\n\nAll tensor quantities will be written throughout this section in the orthonormal tetrad\n1 Q\n1\u221a\nF dt, \u03b8 1 = \u221a\n\u03b8 =\n\u03a8\n\u03a8 F\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03c6 + (P \u2212 by) dt , \u03b8 2 =\n\n1\n1\ndx, \u03b8 3 = dy,\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\nwhich is adapted to the line-element (6).\nThe Einstein equations (9) and (8) are, respectively\nb P \u2032 Q2\n\u2212 \u03a8 2 + \u03a8,xy = 0,\n4 F\n!\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u20322\n\u2032\u2032\n1F\n1Q\n1 P \u2032 2 Q2 b2 Q2\n1F Q\n+ \u03a8,xx \u2212 \u03a8,yy = 0.\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u03a8\n2 FQ\n4 F2\n2 Q\n4 F2\n4 F2\nAs in the previous case, these two partial differential equations have the structure\n\u03a8,xy = H(x)\u03a8,\n\n\u03a8,yy \u2212 \u03a8,xx = G(x)\u03a8,\n\nwhere again H(x) and G(x) stand for the expressions readable from the equations\nabove.

The Einstein equation (7) can be seen equivalent to the following three ordinary\ndifferential equations\nZ1 V1 = \u01eba2 b2\n\nQ2\n,\nF2\n\nZ1 V2 + Z2 V1 = 2b2\nZ2 V2 = b2\n\n\u0011\nQ2 \u0010\n2\nc\n\u2212\n\u01eba\ng\n,\nF2\n\n\u0011\nQ2 \u0010 2 2\n\u01eba\ng\n\u2212\n2cg\n+\nh\n,\n0\nF2\n\n(46)\n\nwhere we have used the usual expression for \u1e232 , consequence of the differential equation for h(y). We must now distinguish, as in previous sections, between two cases\ndepending on whether the function g is a constant (which can be set equal to zero by\nincluding it into h) or not. Let us begin by considering this last situation.\nCase g \u2032 6= 0\nWe are now going to rewrite the system (46) in a simpler form. In order to do this\nwe have to separate the cases when the constant a vanishes or not.\nWhen a 6= 0 it follows from the first equation in the system that Z1 and V1 are\nboth different from zero. Dividing the second equation by the first and taking into\naccount that the constant c can be set equal to zero redefining the functions g and h\nby an additive constant (keeping g + h invariant), we find VV12 + ZZ21 = \u22122g. Dividing the\nh0\nV2\nand ZZ12 are the\nthird equation by the first one, we also have VV21 ZZ12 = g 2 + \u01eba\n2 . Thus, V\n1\n0\ntwo solutions of the quadratic algebraic equation (X + g)2 = \u2212 \u01ebh\nfor the unknown\na2\nX, from where it follows that \u2212\u01ebh0 must be postive or zero. Defining a constant n by\nmeans of h0 \u2261 \u2212\u01eba2 n2 , we have found that equations (46) are equivalent, in the case\na 6= 0, to the system\nZ1 V1 = \u01eba2 b2\n\nQ2\n, Z2 + (g + n) Z1 = 0, V2 + (g \u2212 n) V1 = 0,\nF2\n22\n\n(47)\n\n\fwhich is much simpler because two of the equations are linear in the second derivatives\nwhile in the previous system (46) all equations were quadratic. Then, we have in this\ncase that the two functions Q(x) and F (x) must satisfy the four differential equations\ngiven by (43) and (47). It is not very difficult to see that this system of four second\norder differential equations for two unkowns is incompatible. The proof involves a very\nlong calculation which combines the equations under consideration together with their\nderivatives. The details of this calculation will be omitted here.\nWhen the constant a vanishes, the system (46) is even simpler to handle because\nfrom the first equation it follows that either Z1 = 0 or V1 = 0. Again, the two unknowns\nQ(x) and F (x) must satisfy four ordinary differential equations. A simpler but still\nlong calculation shows that these four differential equations are incompatible and that\nno solution for Q(x) and F (x) exists.\nTherefore, we have that in the subcase (g \u2032 6= 0) no solutions of the Einstein's field\nequations exist. We must then study the case when g is a constant.\nCase g \u2032 = 0\nWe already know that the constant g can be made zero by adding it to the function\nh(y) and it follows from the equation for g that the constant c vanishes in this case.\nIn consequence, the expressions Z2 (x) and V2 (x) vanish identically and the equations\n(46) (one of them is identically satisfied) take the form\n2\nQ2\n2Q\n,\n0\n=\nh\nb\n.\n0\nF2\nF2\nThus, the constant h0 vanishes so that \u01eb = 1 and the function h(y) is the solution of\nthe differential equation \u1e23 = ah =\u21d2 h = eay .\nThe differential equations for the functions Q(x) and F (x) reduce simply to\n\nZ1 V1 = \u01eba2 b2\n\n1 F \u2032 Q\u2032 1 F \u2032 2 1 Q\u2032\u2032 b2 Q2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 a2 = 0,\n2 FQ\n4 F2\n2 Q\n4 F2\n!\n!\n2\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n2\n1 F \u2032\u2032 1 F \u2032 Q\u2032 1 F \u2032 2\n1\nb\n1\nF\nF\nQ\nQ\n2 2Q\n2\n=\na\nb\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2a\n\u2212\n\u2212\n,\n2 F\n2 FQ\n2 F2\n2 F\n2 FQ\n2 F2\nF2\n\n(48)\n\nand the metric line-element is\n2\n\n\u22122ay\n\nds = e\n\n\"\n\nQ2 (x)\n\u2212F (x)dt +\nF (x)\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nd\u03c6 \u2212 bydt\n\n2\n\n+ dx + dy\n\nThe pressure and energy density of the perfect fluid are\np = e2ay\n2ay\n\n\u03c1=e\n\n1 F \u2032 Q\u2032 1 F \u2032 2 b2 Q2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ a2 ,\n2 FQ\n4 F2\n4 F2\n!\n\n1 F \u2032 Q\u2032 1 F \u2032 2 3b2 Q2\n\u2212\n+\n+ a2 .\n2\n2\n2 FQ\n4F\n4 F\n!\n\n23\n\n2\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(49)\n\n\fGiven that the conformal Killing vector is homothetic in this case, we know that the\nequation of state, in case it exists, should be a linear relation p = (\u03b3 + 1)\u03c1, where \u03b3 is\nsome constant.
