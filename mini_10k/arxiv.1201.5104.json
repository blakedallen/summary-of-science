There have been several studies over the years\nof isotopically purified samples of 15 N2 29\u201331 and only a\nfew scattered observations of 14 N15 N appearing in natural abundance (0.74%).14,22,30,32 This is despite the latter being of particular importance to studies of isotopic\nfractionation in planetary atmospheres.33 Information on\nf values and predissociation rates of the secondary isotopomers is very limited but comparison with common\nbands of 14 N2 shows large differences in the observed\nenergy-level perturbations and predissociation rates.34,35\n\nMolecular nitrogen has been one of the most vigorously studied diatomic molecules but many details of its\ncomplex spectrum are still not understood, particularly\nwith regard to its strongly and erratically perturbed absorption intensities and predissociation linewidths. More\ndetailed experimental knowledge of N2 photoabsorption\nand photodissociation, and their isotopic dependence,\nwould help clarify the quantum-mechanical picture of\nthe molecule and is of particular application to a broad\nrange of studies concerning atmospheric and astrophysical photo-chemistry.1\u20134\n\nOn the theoretical side, the seemingly erratic ordering of bands appearing in the N2 XUV spectrum was finally explained by assignment to a minimal series of 1 \u03a3+\nu\nand 1 \u03a0u states which are mutually perturbed by strong\nhomogeneous Rydberg-Valence interactions.12,36,37 This\nbasic theoretical picture culminated in a much later\npaper38 which provided a seminal quantitative model\nof the N2 spectrum by solution of the coupled-channel\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (CSE).39,40 For this, the 1 \u03a3+\nu and\n1\n\u03a0u states and their homogeneous electronic-interactions\nwere treated separately but later models have included\nheterogeneous coupling terms which mix the symmetry classes.41,42 The ab initio calculation of electronic1\ntransition moments connecting the excited 1 \u03a3+\nu and \u03a0u\nstates with the ground state allowed for the reproduction\nof the 14 N2 optical-absorption spectrum as it was then\nknown.43\n\nOn the experimental side, a variety of techniques\nhave been employed to chart the dipole-allowed absorption spectrum of N2 which begins at 100 nm and\nextends to shorter wavelengths, thus restricting optical experiments to windowless techniques. Electronenergy-loss spectroscopy has revealed many prominent\nfeatures at low resolution5\u20137 which have been recorded\nwith greater precision by means of classical spectroscopy\nin emission8\u201310 and in absorption.11\u201313 The finest resolution has been achieved by using combinations of\nmolecular beams and narrow-band tunable XUV laser\nsources.14\u201316 Quantitative measurements of oscillator\nstrength have only been made for absorption bands of\nthe most abundant isotopomer, 14 N2 , and have been\nderived from grating-based spectrometry combined with\nsynchrotron-generated XUV radiation.17\u201319 These follow\nearlier studies20,21 which suffered from saturation effects\ndue to insufficient resolution. Measurements of predissociation rates have been obtained from linewidth studies using laser14,22,23 and synchrotron17\u201319 sources, as\nwell as pump-probe experiments with picosecond time\nresolution.24\u201326 The excitation of predissociative states\nfrom charge-exchanged molecular beams has also provided information about the excitation levels of atomic\n\nA more recent CSE model built upon the previous theoretical work and more recent experimental data provided a new quantitative understanding of the energylevel structure and predissociation mechanism of 1 \u03a0u\nlevels,34,44 including rotational and isotopic effects. This\nwork required the inclusion of a series of homogeneously\ninteracting 3 \u03a0u states, some of which are dissociative,\nand are spin-orbit coupled to the singlet manifold. These\n1\n\n\f3\n\n\u03a0u levels are not accessible by optical transitions from\nthe X 1 \u03a3+\ng ground state, so have been observed only\nsparsely and often by indirect means.7,45,46 An experimentally refined set of electronic-transition moments was\nincorporated into the CSE model47 and allowed for the\nquantitative reproduction of experimental absolute f values for many 14 N2 transitions to 1 \u03a0u excited-levels.\nFourier-transform spectroscopy (FTS) is a powerful\ntool which is widely used for studies at infrared and visible wavelengths, and has been extended to the vacuumultraviolet (VUV) by one previous instrument.48 The\nprincipal advantages of interferometry are the combination of high resolution and the simultaneous measurement of a large spectral region, and an automatically\nlinear frequency scale. Recently, the technique has been\nextended beyond the VUV optical-transmission limit and\ncoupled to the Desirs-beamline undulator source at the\nSoleil synchrotron.49,50 This new instrument provides\nan unprecedented opportunity to record comprehensive\n14 15\nN N absorption spectra suitable for the determination\nof f -values and natural linewidths.\n\nmental settings corresponding to a theoretical resolution\nof 0.27 cm\u22121 full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) were\nadopted for the presently-reported measurements.\nA small section of the measured spectrum is shown\nin Fig. 2 and is compared to a model spectrum. The\nlatter was constructed using fitted values for the transition energies; integrated line-strengths, S; and natural\nwidths, \u0393, of all observed absorption lines. These parameters were used to synthesise an absorption cross-section,\n\u03c3(\u03bd), as a function of wavenumber, \u03bd, and with each line\nrepresented by a Voigt profile equivalent to a convolution\nof its natural Lorentzian lineshape and Gaussian-shaped\nDoppler broadening. The latter broadened the observed\nlines by 0.23\u20130.26 cm\u22121 FWHM over the span of observed\nenergies recorded during these room temperature measurements. A model transmission spectrum, I(\u03bd), was\nthen calculated according to,\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0002\n\u0003\nI(\u03bd) = I0 (\u03bd) exp \u2212N \u03c3(\u03bd) \u2217\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013 s\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n1.2\u03bd\n4 ln 2\n\u22124 ln 2 \u03bd 2\nsinc\n\u2217 \u03c0\u03932 exp\n(1)\n\u03931\n\u039322\n2\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND\nANALYSIS\n\nand directly compared to the observed transmission spectrum. Here, \u2217 indicates a convolution; I0 (\u03bd) is the \u03bddependent intensity of the synchrotron light-source; N is\nthe column density of the target gas; and the instrumental broadening is represented by the right-hand braced\nterm which consists of two components convolved together. The first of these arises from the finite pathdifference achievable while recording interferograms and\ncontributes a FWHM of \u03931 = 0.27 cm\u22121 , which is the instrument's theoretical resolution. The second factor contributes additional Gaussian-shaped broadening which\nwas found to be necessary during the analysis of the\n14 15\nN N spectrum. The natural linewidths of several\nobserved bands are known from previous experiments;\ni.e., excitations to b(0), b(1), b(5), b(6), and c3 (0) (with\nwidths and references listed in Table II); and c\u20324 (2) (listed\nin Table III). Without additional instrumental broadening the fitted widths of transitions to these levels were\nconsistently larger than expected by \u223c0.05 cm\u22121 FWHM.\nBecause of this, a compensating Gaussian broadening\nwas introduced by setting \u03932 in Eq. (1) to 0.13 cm\u22121 .\nThis value was arrived at by fixing the widths of model\ntransitions to the 6 levels listed above and optimising\n\u03932 so as to best match the observed spectrum. The\n6 bands were fitted independently with \u03932 falling in\nthe range 0.11\u20130.14 cm\u22121 FWHM, neglecting a somewhat\nlarger value for the relatively weakly appearing b(0) \u2212 X\nband. This spread implies an uncertainty in the adopted\nmean value of \u223c 0.02 cm\u22121 FWHM. The likely cause\nof this extra broadening is the non-ideal collimation of\nthe synchrotron beam entering the FTS. The broadening\nof narrow features in FTS spectra has been previously\nnoted52,53 where a component of the incident radiation is\nnot aligned with the interferometer's principal axis. The\nangular distribution of the present synchrotron beam is\n\nThe characteristics of the Desirs beamline FTS49\u201351\nand general properties of ultraviolet interferometry48 are\ngiven in detail elsewhere and are only briefly described\nhere. The spectrometer is based upon a wave-frontdivision interferometer and may be operated at XUV and\nVUV wavelengths. A reflection-only configuration has\nbeen chosen due to the difficulty in manufacturing beamsplitters with the required optical-quality in the VUV\nand transparency in the XUV. The coherent synchrotronbeam is spatially divided at the interface of two roofshaped reflectors and an interference pattern is generated\nfollowing its recombination at a photodiode. An interferogram is recorded by systematically translating one of\nthe reflectors, altering the optical path-difference of the\ndivided beams. The purified 14 N15 N sample flows continuously through a 100 mm windowless absorption-cell\nwith two 150 mm \u00d7 28 mm2 external capillaries. Thus,\nthe sample gas column density could not be diagnosed\nabsolutely.\nThe synchrotron-beam spectrum was produced by an\nundulator insertion which provided a continuum background of high brightness and with a bandwidth of approximately 7% of its central energy. The energy range\nstudied here required two overlapping spectral windows\nwith approximately 7000 cm\u22121 bandwidth. Figure 1\nshows a combined spectrum. Ultimately, the FTS can\nachieve a resolving power close to one million for XUV\nwavelengths down to 40 nm.49 For the present study, the\nFTS settings have been chosen as a compromise between\na good signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, and a reasonable\nstability of the mirror translation mechanism (see below\nfor a detailed discussion on this latter point).

Here, a\nsimple Gaussian model of the resultant broadening was\nadopted in the absence of a more precise characterisation.\nThe parameters defining each model line were adjusted by an optimisation routine until a least-squares\nbest-fit of I(\u03bd) of Eq. (1) to the experimental spectrum\nwas achieved. The deduced transition-energies were converted into excited-state term energies using the known\nground-state molecular parameters of 14 N15 N.54 Indeed,\nthe fitting of congested spectra was facilitated by the fixing of combination differences arising from ground-state\nenergies for modelled P (J \u2032 + 1) and R(J \u2032 \u2212 1) lines which\nterminate on common excited-state rotational levels, J \u2032 .\nSimilarly, any natural broadening of such pairs of transitions can only be due to predissociation of their common\n\nwhere the range of integration spans the non-negligible\nextent of each line. Each measured line strength was converted into a line f -value, following division by a groundstate population factor, \u03b1J \u2032\u2032 , which models a Boltzmann\ndistribution at a temperature of 300 K. These have been\nreduced further to a set of band f -values, fJ \u2032 , calculated for each rotational line by the further division of a\nH\u00f6nl-London rotational line-strength factor appropriate\n3\n\n\fTransition\n1\n\nRotational\nbranch\n\n\u03a3 \u2190 1\u03a3\n\nJ \u2032\u2032 /(2J \u2032\u2032 + 1)\n\nP\n\n1\n\nby fitting to a noisy spectrum were assessed by the optimisation routine and varied broadly depending on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio at each line's peak and its blendedness. Second, the column density of flowing 14 N15 N\nin the FTS absorption cell is unknown so that the deduced absorption f -values must be uniformly scaled relative to an absolute reference. There are no existing\nmeasurements of 14 N15 N absolute f -values but 14 N2 has\nbeen characterised with 10% uncertainty in a previous\nsynchrotron- and diffraction-grating-based absorption\nexperiment.17\u201319 A calibration of 14 N15 N column density\nmay be made relative to 14 N2 assuming an isotopomeric\nindependence of f -values. This independence is reasonable only for the lowest b 1 \u03a0u vibrational levels because\nof the occurrence of large isotopomer-sensitive perturbations for higher-energy electronic-vibrational states, as\ndiscussed below. A column density of 1.2 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122\nwas deduced for the lower-energy FTS spectrum plotted\nin Fig. 1 following the comparison of 14 N2 and 14 N15 N\nf -values for 82 rotational transitions to 5 excited vibrational levels, b 1 \u03a0u (v = 0 \u2212 4). Overlapping bands of\nthe higher-lying spectrum were cross calibrated with this\nand a column density of 1.1 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 deduced. Given\nthe large number of transitions compared between experiments and spectra, the uncertainty of the deduced column densities are dominated by the original 10% transferred from measurements of 14 N2 . Thus, a 10% systematic uncertainty has been assigned to all measured\nf -values. Third, a significant addition to the uncertainty of measured f -values arises from environmentallyinduced mechanical vibrations afflicting the translation\nmechanism of the FTS. Assuming the occurrence of a\nperiodic translation-error as the path difference of the\ninterferometer is scanned, the resultant spectrum will include ghost reproductions of itself doubly repeated at\nhigher and lower energies.56 In the present measurements, the environmental noise is sufficiently aperiodic\nthat sharp spectral features are not apparently aliased\nin this way, apart from a few extremely-weak ghost features which are likely to be associated with the very\nstrong band c\u20324 (0) 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 X(0). However, an apparent\nrandom-variation of the center energy of the synchrotronbeam bandpass resulted in completely saturated absorption lines in the recorded spectrum with minima that do\nnot correspond to zero transmission. Locally shifting the\nspectrum vertically until the lineshapes of saturated features are adequately reproduced by a model fit allowed\nfor an assessment of this spurious effect. In all cases, a\nshift of 5% of the undulator peak-intensity, or less, was\nnecessary and it was assumed that a worst-case vertical\nshift of this magnitude may affect all lines. An additional\nuncertainty was estimated for each line according to the\nrange of fitted line strength following from an assumed\nupward or downward shift of this magnitude.\n\nS J \u2032\u2032\n\n1\n\n\u03a3\u2190 \u03a3\n\nR\n\n(J\n\n1\n\n\u03a0 \u2190 1\u03a3\n\nP\n\n(J \u2032\u2032 \u2212 1)/2(2J \u2032\u2032 + 1)\n\n1\n\n\u03a0 \u2190 1\u03a3\n\nQ\n\n(2J \u2032\u2032 + 1)/2(2J \u2032\u2032 + 1)\n\n1\n\n\u03a0 \u2190 1\u03a3\n\nR\n\n(J \u2032\u2032 + 2)/2(2J \u2032\u2032 + 1)\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+ 1)/(2J \u2032\u2032 + 1)\n\nTABLE I.

The quantity fJ \u2032 is only representative of the integrated strength of an electronicvibrational band if it is isolated from other electronic\nstates. That is, a variation of fJ \u2032 within a rotational\nseries indicates the presence of a perturbation,55 and it\nis appropriate to index this by J \u2032 only because the N2\nground state is known to be unperturbed. Furthermore,\nheterogeneous perturbations may cause fJ \u2032 to diverge for\ntransitions with common J \u2032 but appearing within different rotational branches.19,35\nThe uncertainties of fitted transition-energies were estimated during the optimisation of the model spectrum\nand (for well-resolved lines) typically had a standard\ndeviation of \u223c0.02 cm\u22121 . An inherent property of the\nFTS-deduced transition energies is that they may be calibrated absolutely across an entire spectrum by the multiplication of a single scaling factor. In principle, this could\nbe achieved by comparison with a single reference line. In\nthis case, absolute calibration was made by comparison\nwith a previous high-precision laser-based experiment,30\nwith reference to 24 transitions terminating on various\nrotational levels of b 1 \u03a0u (v = 5, 6), c3 1 \u03a0u (v = 0), and\nb \u2032 1 \u03a3+\nu (v = 1). The absolute uncertainty of the reference\ndata was estimated to be 0.003 cm\u22121 and the combined\nstatistical and systematic-calibration uncertainties of observed transition energies and deduced term values are\ndominated by the statistical component in most cases.\nNone of the laser-spectroscopic reference lines fall in the\nrange of the higher-energy spectrum plotted in Fig. 1 and\nthis was calibrated by reference to lines overlapping the\nlower-energy spectrum.\nThe deduced f -values acquired uncertainty from three\ndifferent sources. First, the random errors introduced\n\nThe statistical line-fitting error and column density uncertainty are dominant for lines appearing weakly in the\nspectrum. Strongly absorbed lines are more sensitive to\na vertical shift of the spectrum, as are those lines near\n4\n\n\f110000\n100000\n\n105000\n\n\u2212\n\nPotential energy (cm 1 )\n\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation55 factorises the\ndiatomic molecular-wavefunction, \u03c6i (r, R), according to\n\no3 1\u03a0u\nc3 1\u03a0u\n\n\u03c8i (r, R) = \u03c7(R) \u03c6(r; R).\n\nThis includes a vibrational component, \u03c7(R), which depends only on internuclear distance, R, and an electronic\ncomponent, \u03c6(r; R), which principally depends on electron coordinates, r, which are relative to the molecular\ncenter-of-mass. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation\nis unsuitable for the modelling of high-precision experimental data because it is assumed that the electronic\nwavefunction has only negligible R-dependence.

The magnitude of the latter was estimated in the same fashion as the f -values uncertainty\ndiscussed above and, in the case of linewidths, is typically much smaller than the statistical fitting errors.\nAny error in the width of instrumental broadening in\nEq. (1) will lead directly to an error in fitted natural\nlinewidths and in consideration of this an extra systematic uncertainty of 0.03 cm\u22121 FWHM was attributed to\nall fitted linewidths. This is more conservative than the\nuncertainty of \u03932 estimated above in order to account\nfor potential model error incurred by assuming Gaussian broadening in Eq. (1).

Adjustment of \u03bc is sufficient to extend the CSE calculations\nto any isotopomer of N2 without alteration of the massindependent PECs and coupling parameters.\nThe 1 \u03a0u PECs and interaction parameters were optimised with comparison to a database of experimental energy levels.34 The addition of an extra term,\n~2 J(J + 1)/2\u03bcR2 , representing a centrifugal potential\nwas added to the CSE PECs44,47 which allowed for\nthe calculation of excited rotational levels, according\nto the total angular-momentum quantum-number, J.\nPreviously, the CSE model was used to calculate term\norigins and rotational constants for all 1 \u03a0u levels below 105 350 cm\u22121 and reproduced their experimentally\nknown values to within 0.5 and 0.007 cm\u22121 , respectively,\nfor all three isotopomers of N2 .34 Similar agreement is\nseen for calculations compared to the newly observed\n14 15\nN N levels following a slight adjustment of the 1 \u03a0u\nPECs necessary to account for the present extension to\nhigher energy.\n\nCSE MODELLING\n\nThe absorption f -values and predissociation broadening of 14 N15 N 1 \u03a0u \u2212 X transitions were also studied here\nby means of a theoretical model of the molecule. A\npreviously formulated CSE39,40 model of N2 1 \u03a0u -states\nwas extended to make new calculations for higher-energy\n14 15\nN N vibrational levels than previously studied.34,44,47\nThe relevant 1 \u03a0u potential-energy curves (PECs) are\nplotted in Fig. 3 and include one valence state, labelled\nb, and two Rydberg states, c3 and o3 .

All of the strictlye-parity 1 \u03a3+\nu levels will be more or less heterogeneously\nperturbed; except those with J = 0, because of the lack\nof perturbing 1 \u03a0u J = 0 levels.\n\nThe additional definition of a ground-state PEC\nand vibrational wavefunction \u03c7X (R), and R-dependent\ne\nelectronic-transition moments,47 RjX\n(R), for the optical\ntransitions b \u2212 X, c3 \u2212 X, and o3 \u2212 X permitted the calculation of an absorption cross-section, \u03c3iXJ \u2032 J \u2032\u2032 from the\nCSE-calculated coupled wavefunctions, according to\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\u03c3iXJ \u2032 J \u2032\u2032 =\nA total of 25 absorption bands were observed and\nreduced to a set of transition energies, line strengths,\nand natural linewidths. Excited-state term values have\nbeen calculated from the observed transition energies and\nknown ground-state level energies,54 and band f -values\nhave been calculated from the observed line strengths\naccording to Eq. (3). The complete set of deduced line\nparameters is available in an on-line data archive accompanying this article.59 Important features of the observed\n1\n\u03a0u \u2212 X- and 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 X- bands are discussed in the following subsections. This discussion does not emphasise\nclassical spectroscopic analysis of band parameters and\nmolecular constants, and instead favours a direct assessment of the primary data. This is believed to be appropriate because the highly perturbed N2 spectrum can be\nmore profitably modelled by CSE-type calculations than\nlocal deperturbation methods.\nEvident in the observations of excited 1 \u03a0u and 1 \u03a3+\nu\nstates are a number of rotationally-dependent transitionenergy and linewidth perturbations that indicate the\npresence of additional 3 \u03a0u states beyond the scope of\nthe present CSE model. This includes the appearance\nof extra lines in the spectrum arising from nominally\nforbidden absorption to these levels. The analysis and\ndiscussion of these perturbations is reserved for a later\npublication.\n\n2\n\n\u03c0\u03bd\n4~\u01eb0\n\nX\n\nj=b,c3 ,o3\n\nSiXJ \u2032 J \u2032\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u03c7\u2020ij (R)\n\ne\nRjX\n(R)\n\n\u03c7X (R) dR\n\n.\n(8)\n\nHere, SiXJ \u2032\u2032 J \u2032 is a H\u00f6nl-London rotational line-strength\nfactor57 which differs for electronic states of different\nsymmetry and ground- and excited-state rotational levels, J \u2032 and J \u2032\u2032 , respectively. Resonances in the \u03c3iXJ \u2032 J \u2032\u2032\nspectrum are of mixed electronic character and must be\nassigned to approximate electronic-vibrational progressions as is done for experimental spectra. The calculated\ncross-sections may be converted to equivalent band f values and the model electronic-transition moments were\noptimised with respect to a set of experimental 14 N2 absorption f -values.47 These transition moments were not\naltered for the present calculations of 14 N15 N.\nPredissociation of the 1 \u03a0u states was long suspected to\narise from multiple spin-orbit perturbations with bound\nand dissociative states of 3 \u03a0u symmetry.12,14,36 The precise mechanism has been deduced by Lewis et al.34,46,58\nand the resultant picture of 3 \u03a0u states consists of two\nwith valence character, C \u2032 3 \u03a0u and C 3 \u03a0u , and two\nRydberg-states, G3 3 \u03a0u and F3 3 \u03a0u ; with PECs plotted\nin Fig. 3. The C \u2032 3 \u03a0u and C 3 \u03a0u states were incorporated\ninto an extended matrix of the form of Eq. (6), along with\nan electronic coupling between them and spin-orbit interactions mixing them with the 1 \u03a0u states.34,44,47 This\nallowed for quantitative CSE modelling of the predissociation linewidths of the lowest 1 \u03a0u levels. These calculations demonstrated good agreement with the thenavailable experimental linewidths collected from all three\nisotopomers of N2 .34,46 The inclusion of an unbound\nstate, C \u2032 3 \u03a0u , in the CSE formulation permits the calculation of Eq. (8) for all values of E, in which case the\npredissociation of 1 \u03a0u levels manifests as broadened resonances in a continuous absorption cross-section.\nThe CSE model employed here does not include states\nwith 1 \u03a3+\nu symmetry, and so is only strictly representative of the f -parity levels of the doubly-degenerate\n1\n\u03a0u states. This results from a rotational-perturbation\n55\nwhich mixes e-parity levels of the 1 \u03a0u and 1 \u03a3+\nu states,\nand increases in severity approximately proportionately\nto J(J + 1). Consequently, the lowest-J e-parity 1 \u03a0u\nrotational-levels will be least perturbed, as will those for\n1\n\u03a0u vibrational-levels which lie below the onset of the\n1 +\n\u03a3u states. Because of these rotational interactions, the\n14 15\nN N linewidths and f -values deduced from observed\nP - or R-branch transitions with e-parity 1 \u03a0u excitedstates may then differ from those inferred from Q-branch\n\nA.\n\n1\n\n\u03a0u states\n\nA summary set of rotationless quantities is given in\nTable II for the observed 1 \u03a0u \u2212 X transitions. For these,\nthe experimentally deduced line parameters have been\nextrapolated to J \u2032 = 0 in order to facilitate a simple\ncomparison with CSE-calculated values and other experiments. There is no physical level corresponding to J \u2032 = 0\nin the case of 1 \u03a0u states but a smooth extrapolation has\nbeen made to a virtual J \u2032 = 0 level which is, in princi1\nple, free of 1 \u03a3+\nu \u223c \u03a0u rotational mixing for both e- and\nf -parity levels. Also listed are CSE calculations of 1 \u03a0u\nrotationless f -values and predissociation linewidths, as\nwell as any previous linewidth measurements.\nFigure 4 compares the available experimental 1 \u03a0u \u2212 X\nf -values for 14 N2 and 14 N15 N with CSE calculations for\nall isotopomers. It was assumed during the calibration\nof the experimental column density that the f -values of\nb(v = 0 \u2212 4) \u2212 X are mass independent, and this is supported by the model calculations.

No rotational\n\nhere, validating the accuracy of the model electronictransition moments constructed with reference to 14 N2\nonly.47\nThe mass dependence of b 1 \u03a0u \u2212 X f -values is much\n7\n\n\flines from this band with J \u2032 < 12 were observed in the\npresent 14 N15 N spectrum and only an upper bound could\nbe deduced for the J = 0 f -value, in agreement with its\nCSE-predicted weakness.\nParticularly interesting is the factor-of-5 difference in\nthe rotationless f -values of b(9) \u2212 X and o3 (1) \u2212 X, with\nabsorption to b(9) being the stronger in observations of\n14\nN2 32 and o3 (1) in the present spectrum of 14 N15 N. This\nswitch occurs because of a change of sign in the quantum\ninterference of mixed b \u2212 X and o3 \u2212 X transition amplitudes where there is a change in energy ordering. That is,\nthe term origin of o3 (1) lies below b(9) for 14 N2 and above\nit for the other isotopomers. Indeed, there is a level crossing in the 14 N2 rotational series of o3 (1) and b(9) between\nJ = 4 and 5, which leads to the o3 (1) \u2212 X f -value being\nthe larger for this isotopomer also for J \u2265 5.32 These\nisotopomeric differences are well modelled by the nonlinear sum of transition amplitudes in Eq. (8), whereby\nmass-dependent shifts of 1 \u03a0u levels are sufficient to alter\ntheir degree of mixing and cause the observed variation\nof f -values to occur in the CSE calculations.\nThe rotational dependence of 1 \u03a0u \u2212X f -values is summarised in the various plots of Fig. 5. The experimentally\ndetermined and CSE-modelled f -values are in excellent\nagreement for all of the observed vibrational bands, even\nwhere the variation with J approaches an order of magnitude, as is the case for absorption to b(6), b(8), and\no3 (0). The model actually predicts the complete disappearance of b(6) \u2212 X and b(11) \u2212 X for rotational transitions above those observed. Additionally, the band head\nof b(8) \u2212 X is completely invisible in the FTS spectrum\nand the experimental f -values that have been deduced\nexhibit a rapid growth, in line with the CSE calculations.\nIn fact, the CSE model predicts completely-destructive\ninterference of the 1 \u03a0u \u2212 X transition amplitudes describing absorption to b(8), leading to a minimum in the\n14 15\nN N Q-branch f -values at J \u2032 = 8, and similar minima\nat J \u2032 = 12 and 0 for the cases of 14 N2 and 15 N2 .\nIn the case of b(3) \u2212 X, it was not possible to independently fit lineshapes to each rotational transition because\ntheir linewidths are similar to their spacing, and the P\nand Q branches are unfortuitously overlapped. Instead, a\nsmooth variation of band f -values was assumed for each\nrotational branch and constrained to the following polynomials with optimised coefficients:\n\nbranch with increasing J, notably for excitation to b(5),\nb(6), c3 (0), c3 (1), and o3 (0). This is due to heterogeneous\nmixing with the 1 \u03a3+\nu states and is discussed further in\nSec. IV B.\nThe experimental and modelled rotationless linewidths\nof 14 N15 N span several orders-of-magnitude, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. CSE-calculated and previous experimental linewidths of 14 N2 and 15 N2 are also shown in\nthis figure and exhibit a large mass dependence for many\n1\n\u03a0u levels. The various experimental natural linewidths\nare not strictly comparable with the CSE-calculated dissociation linewidths which do not include the broadening\ninfluence of radiative decay. In effect, this is only significant for the least predissociated levels such as b(1),\nwhere the difference between calculated and observed\nwidth for 14 N2 b(1) is eliminated once radiative decay\nis considered.34\nIn Fig. 6, the CSE model correctly reproduces the\nlarge 14 N15 N linewidths of b(v = 2, 3, 4) and c3 (0), all\nof which differ by a significant amount from the previously observed 14 N2 and 15 N2 widths, providing further\nvalidation of its predictiveness. The lack of observable\nlinewidths encountered in the 14 N15 N spectrum for excited levels between b(5) and b(8) is unsurprising given\nthe narrowness of their linewidths predicted by the CSE\ncalculations and observed for the other isotopomers. A\nbroadening of 14 N15 N levels then occurs for b(9) and\nhigher levels, which is consistent with the general trends\nobserved for 14 N2 and 15 N2 . There is a reversal of the\nratio of b(9) and o3 (1) linewidths with respect to 14 N2\nand the other isotopomers apparent in Fig. 6 which is\nanalogous to the previously-discussed f -value anomalies\nof b(9) \u2212 X and o3 (1) \u2212 X.\nThe general trend of predissociation widths in Fig. 6\nsuggests a maximum near 103 000 cm\u22121 and minimum\naround 106 000 cm\u22121 . This is consistent with the picture of 3 \u03a0u predissociation deduced by a previous CSE\nmodel58 which included a representation of not only\nC 3 \u03a0u and C \u2032 3 \u03a0u but also the Rydberg states G3 3 \u03a0u\nand F3 3 \u03a0u , a lack of which limits the present model to\nthe calculation of widths for levels below o3 (0).34 No 1 \u03a0u\nstates were included in the G3 /F3 model but it is reasonable to assume an approximate transfer of the energy\ndependence of 3 \u03a0u predissociation to these, explaining\nthe broad similarity of 1 \u03a0u linewidths in Fig. 6 and the\npredicted widths of 3 \u03a0u states shown in Fig. 4 of Ref. 58.\n\nfP (J \u2032 ) = 0.042 \u2212 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 J \u2032 (J \u2032 + 1);\nfQ (J \u2032 ) = 0.041 \u2212 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 J \u2032 (J \u2032 + 1);\n\nThe rotational dependencies of comparable observed\nand calculated 1 \u03a0u linewidths are plotted in Fig. 7. The\nlinewidths of some excited levels were assumed to follow\na simple polynomial dependence with fitted coefficients.\nThis was necessary in the case of b(0) \u2212 X because this\nband appears relatively weakly in the spectrum and with\na poor signal-to-noise ratio, whereas the linewidths of\nb(1) \u2212 X are close to the lower bound of measurability, and the rotational lines of b(3) \u2212 X are excessively\nblended. For these bands, fitted natural linewidths were\nassumed to have the following forms for both e- and f -\n\nfR (J \u2032 ) = 0.040 \u2212 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 J \u2032 (J \u2032 + 1).\nAn attempt to model the f -values of all three b(3) \u2212\nX rotational branches to a common function resulted in\na poorer fit to the FTS spectrum, suggesting that the\ndeduced splitting of the branches for high J is a real\nphenomenon.\nSeveral 1 \u03a0u \u2212 X bands are observed to have P - and\nR-branch f -values which increasingly diverge from the Q8\n\n\f0.004\n\n0.015\n\nb(0)\n\n0.003\n\n0.03\n\nb(1)\n\n0.010\n\n0.02\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\nb(2)\n\n0.002\n0.001\n0.000\n\n0.000\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\nb(3)\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0.006\n\n25\n\n30\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n0.015\n\nb(7)\n\n0.004\n\n0.02\n\n0.010\n\n0.002\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0.000\n\n0.00\n0\n\n0.008\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0.004\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nb(10)\n\nc3 (0)\n\n0.08\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nb(8)\n\n0\n\n30\n\n5\n\nb(11)\n\n0\n0.03\n\nc3 (1)\n\n5\n\nc3 (2)\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n10\n\n0.002\n\n0.06\n\n0.10\n\n5\n\n0.000\n0\n\n0.10\n\n30\n\n0.004\n\n0.000\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0\n\n0.004\n\n15\n\n0.008\n\n0.000\n\n0.15\n\n10\n\n0.006\n\n0.002\n\n0.20\n\n5\n\n0.012\n\n0.004\n\n25\n\n0.000\n0\n\n0.008\n\nb(9)\n\n0.006\n\n20\n\n0.00\n0\n\n0.03\n\nb(6)\n\n15\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n0\n\nf\n\nb(4)\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n\n10\n\n0.10\n\n0.04\n\n0.01\n\n5\n\nb(5)\n\n0.15\n\n0.06\n\n0.02\n\n0\n0.20\n\n0.08\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\no3 (0)\n\n0.015\n\n0.002\n\n0.010\n\n0.001\n\n0.005\n\n0.000\n\n0.000\n5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0.020\n\n0.003\n\n0\n\n0.00\n0\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\no3 (1)\n0\n\n5\n\nJ\n\n\u2032\n\nFIG. 5.

Experimentally determined\nnatural linewidths are from the present and previous observations (filled and empty circles, respectively), and CSE-calculated\npredissociation linewidths (which exclude radiative broadening) are connected by lines. The locations of o3 (1) and b(9) have\nbeen shifted from their true T0 for clarity and a horizontal line has been superimposed indicating the minimum width detectable\nin the present 14 N15 N spectrum. References to previous measurements of 14 N15 N linewidths are given in Table II, values for\n14\nN2 and 15 N2 are collected from a variety of sources.14,18,23,25,26,31,32,46,60\n\nhibit variation up to a factor of 4. There is, however, an\napparently-uniform under-calculation of linewidths for\nb(2), b(4) and c3 (0) which cannot be explained by the\nneglect of additional broadening due to radiative decay.\nThis suggests that an adjustment of the CSE coupling of\n1\n\u03a0u and 3 \u03a0u states may be necessary.\nB.\n\n1\n\n\u03a3+\nu states\n\nA summary set of rotationless quantities is given in\nTable III for the observed 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 X transitions. There\nare no comparable experimental f -values or rotationless natural-linewidths apart from a measurement of the\nwidth of c\u20324 (1)24 which falls below the lower measurable\nlimit of the present observations, as do the linewidths of\nall other observed 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 X transitions with the exception of excitations to b\u2032 (6) and b\u2032 (7). No J-dependence of\nlinewidths was observed for these two vibrational levels.\nThe dearth of 1 \u03a3+\nu states observed to predissociate\nis unsurprising if it is assumed that this should follow\nfrom a highly indirect mechanism requiring their rotational coupling to 1 \u03a0u states which are in turn spinorbit coupled to 3 \u03a0u states. Interestingly, the approximate J(J + 1) proportionality expected for rotationalcoupling-induced predissociation is not observed for b\u2032 (6)\nand b\u2032 (7). An alternative homogeneous-predissociation\nmechanism involving a direct interaction of b\u2032 1 \u03a3+\nu with\nthe \u03a9 = 0 levels of C \u2032 3 \u03a0u or C 3 \u03a0u offers a possible explanation of the b\u2032 (6) and b\u2032 (7) linewidths. Significantly\nJ-dependent natural linewidths were observed for b\u2032 (4)\nfor J \u2265 3 and will be discussed in a future paper concern10\n\ning the detection of 3 \u03a0u states in the 14 N15 N spectrum.\nFigure 8 shows the rotational dependence of experimental f -values for the observed 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 X bands. In\nall cases, there is a strong J-dependence of f -values and\nsome degree of divergence of the two rotational branches.\nParticularly large branching is seen for b\u2032 (4) \u2212 X, where\nthe lack of measurements of f -values for R-branch lines\nwith J \u2032 > 10 is due to their complete disappearance from\nthe spectrum. Similarly, the large branching ratio for\nb\u2032 (7) \u2212 X is not well highlighted in Fig. 8 because of the\ncompletely annihilated P -branch for J \u2032 > 4.\nAn example of strong state-interaction occurs for the\n\u2032\n1 +\ngroup of bands c3 (0) 1 \u03a0u , c\u20324 (0) 1 \u03a3+\nu , b (1) \u03a3u , and\n1\n15,61,62\nb(5) \u03a0u and has been analysed previously\nwith\nrespect to 14 N2 and 15 N2 . A homogeneous interaction of\nc\u20324 (0) and b\u2032 (1) is evident in the present 14 N15 N spectrum\nfrom a mutual repulsion of their deduced term series from\na crossing point between J = 10 and 11. This perturbation is also evident in the f -values of Fig. 8 where the\nvery strong c\u20324 (0)\u2212X band is anomalously weakened near\nJ = 10, while the much weaker b\u2032 (1) \u2212 X is greatly increased. Without this interaction and the transfer of line\nstrength from c\u20324 (0) \u2212 X it is likely that b\u2032 (1) \u2212 X would\nbe too weak to be observed in the present spectrum, as\nb\u2032 (0) \u2212 X, b\u2032 (2) \u2212 X and b\u2032 (3) \u2212 X are.\nThere is also an evident P /R branching of c\u20324 (0) \u2212 X\nf -values, with the P branch appearing stronger for J <\n10. The reverse branching is evident in the f -values of\nc3 (0) \u2212 X, plotted in Fig. 5, and these effects are broadly\nattributable to a heterogeneous interaction of c\u20324 (0) 1 \u03a3+\nu\nand c3 (0) 1 \u03a0u e-parity states so that the observed levels\n1\nare of mixed 1 \u03a3+\nu / \u03a0u character.

This\nreversal with respect to low J is not mirrored in the f values of c3 (0) \u2212 X, indicating that c\u20324 (0) is now principally perturbed by b(5) which lies at higher energy and\nexhibits an appropriately strengthened P -branch. The\nweakening of the b(5) \u2212 X R-branch with respect to the\n11\n\nP -branch for increasing rotation is dramatically evident\nin the experimental trace plotted in Fig. 2. The Q-branch\nof b(5) \u2212 X is seen to have an intermediate strength because such 1 \u03a0u \u2212 X transitions terminating on f -parity\nlevels are not prone to heterogeneous interaction with the\n1 +\n\u03a3u states.\nA similar degree of multi-state mixing is suggested by\nthe f -values of c\u20324 (1) and b\u2032 (4) which may be principally\nattributed to their own homogeneous mixing as well as\nheterogeneous interactions with the nearby 1 \u03a0u levels\n\n\f0.06\n\nb (1)\n\n0.0020\n\nb (4)\n\n\u2032\n\nb (5)\n\n\u2032\n\n0.020\n\n0.04\n\n\u2032\n\n0.0015\n\n0.015\n0.0010\n0.010\n\n0.02\n\n0.0005\n\n0.005\n0.00\n\n0.000\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0.003\n\n25\n\n30\n\n5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0.0012\n\nb (6)\n\n0.0000\n30\n0\n\n0.0008\n\n0.001\n\n0.0004\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0.12\n0.08\n\n0.0000\n30\n0\n\nc4 (1)\n\u2032\n\n0.008\n\n15\n\n0.16\n\n0.04\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u2032\n\n0.002\n\n0.000\n\n5\n\n0.20\n\nb (7)\n\n\u2032\n\nf\n\n25\n\n0.004\n\nc4 (0)\n\u2032\n\n0.00\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n5\n\nc4 (2)\n\u2032\n\n0.006\n0.002\n\n0.004\n0.002\n0.000\n\n0.000\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n5\n\nJ\n\n\u2032\n\n14 15\nFIG. 8. Rotational dependence of 1 \u03a3+\nN N f -values labelled according to their excited vibrational-level.\nu \u2212 X experimental\nValues are shown for P - and R-branch transitions (dark and light points, respectively).\n\nc3 (1) and b(8). Likewise, the observed heterogeneous\nperturbation of b\u2032 (7) and c\u20324 (2) f -values is primarily the\nresult of rotational mixing with b(11) and c3 (2).\nThese examples illustrate the multi-level nature of perturbations that occur throughout the N2 spectrum. But\nbecause of the strength of the responsible electronic and\nrotational interactions, these are best explained in a\nglobal manner, such as by means of the CSE technique,\nrather than in terms of a local perturbation of a finite set\nof bands.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe results of a survey of 14 N15 N XUV photoabsorption between 100 000 and 109 000 cm\u22121 are presented here\nand in an accompanying data archive59 in terms of observed line-energies and linewidths, and deduced termvalues and f -values. All of these data were derived from\nmeasurements made with the FTS permanently fixed to\nthe Desirs undulator source at the Soleil synchrotron,\nand this combination of an intense and broadband XUV\nsource and very highly resolving spectrometer is well\nsuited to the present study. The revealed patterns of\nf -values and natural linewidths are complicated and perturbed at both the vibrational-band and rotational level,\nand differ markedly from observations of the other two\nisotopomers of N2 . The effects of indirect predissocia12\n\ntion are clearly evident in the measured linewidths, and\nthe divergent f -values of rotational branches within the\nsame band clearly indicate the rotational mixing of 1 \u03a0u\nand 1 \u03a3+\nu levels.\nA CSE model was constructed without reference to\nthe data collected here but its predictions are uniformly\nexcellent when compared with the new measurements,\nproviding further proof of the suitability of the technique\nfor the modeling of the N2 spectrum. Work is under\nway to extend the CSE formulation to include e-parity\nexcited states and a more complete interaction of 1 \u03a0u\n3\nand 1 \u03a3+\nu states with the dissociative \u03a0u states. This\nwork will be aided by observations in the present 14 N15 N\nspectrum of previously-undetected direct perturbations\nbetween singlet and triplet levels, which are currently\nbeing analysed for a future report.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been carried out within the framework\nof the NWO astrochemistry program.
