This detector operates as usual MICROMEGAS, but in the\ncase of sparks, which may appear at high gas gains, the resistive mesh reduces their\ncurrent and makes the sparks harmless. This approach could be complementary to the\nongoing efforts of various groups to develop spark-protected MICROMEGAS with\nresistive anode planes.\n\n1. Introduction\nDuring the last year there have been intense efforts from various groups to develop spark\n\u2013protected micropattern gaseous detectors with resistive electrodes (see for example [1]\nand references there in). In our recent report [2] we presented the first results from tests\nof \"home- made\" MICROMEGAS with a resistive cathode mesh. As was shown earlier,\nresistive electrodes may reduce the discharge current by a factor of 1000 and thus\nprotect the detector and the front end electronics from being damaged. We named this\ndetector a Resistive Mesh MICROMEGAS or RM-MICROMEGAS.\nHome-made designs of RM-MICROMEGAS had 50 or 100 \u03bcm width spacers made of\nNylon fishing lines or from Kapton meshes and were very convenient for general studies\nand design optimization since they allow easy changes to be made. It is obvious,\nhowever, that this primitive detector assembling technique has a lot of limitations.\nMoreover it was observed that the maximum achievable gain depends on the spacer\nshape and materials from which they were made.\nIn this report we present preliminary results from the tests of the first prototype RMMICROMEGAS with resistive cathode mesh manufactured by a so-called \"bulk\"\ntechnology [3]. With the bulk RM-MICROMEGAS we were able to achieve almost the\nsame gas gains as with conventional MICROMEGAS having a metallic cathode mesh.\nThe main advantages of this technology is that it has the potential to build large-area,\nhigh quality, spark \u2013protected detectors.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n\fThe resistive meshes used for the construction of RM-MICROMEGAS were\nmanufactured by a laser drilling technique from the resistive Kapton 100XC10E5\n(resistivity 2.8-3 M\u03a9/\u25a1) used earlier by us in the RETGEM designs [4]. The resistive\nmeshes had a thickness of 20\u03bcm, a hole diameter d=50 \u03bcm and hole spacing a=100 \u03bcm.\nThe bulk RM-MICROMEGAS was manufactured in a few steps. First the anode plate\n(fiber glass with a 20\u03bcm thick Cu layer) and a photosensitive film (DUPONT\nphotoimageable coverlay PC1025) having the right thickness and the resistive mesh were\nlaminated together at an elevated temperature forming a monolithic object. The\nphotosensitive film was then photolitographically etched so that supporting pillars were\nformed. These pillars had a cylindrical shape with a 300\u03bcm\n\nFig. 1. A magnified photograph of the bulk MICROMEGAS cathode resistive mesh with\nincorporated supporting pillars under it.\n\n\fFig. 2. A photograph of the bulk MICROMEGAS with resistive mesh. Regularly\ndistributed dots over the sensitive area are the mesh supporting pillars.\ndiameter, their height was 128\u03bcm and the pitchwas 2mm (see Fig.1).\nIt is known that the \"bulk\" technology allows large-area MICROMEGAS to be built,\nhowever for the sake of simplicity the first prototype had an active area of only 5x5cm2\n(see Fig. 2). The anode plate was manufactured from a Cu coated fiber glass printed\ncircuit plate.\nThe RM-MICROMEGAS was tested in a gas chamber using an experimental setup\nshown in Fig.3. In comparative studies we also used several conventional\nMICROMEGAS including one manufactured by the bulk technology.\n\n\fFig. 3. A schematic drawing of the experimental setup used for the RM-MICROMEGAS\nstudies\nThe chamber was flushed with one of the following gas mixtures: Ar+5%isobutane,\nNe+7%CH4 or Ar+7%CH4.\nThe primary ionization in the drift region of the detector was produced either by alpha\nparticles from 241Am or by 6keV photons from 55Fe. The avalanche signals were detected\nby a charge sensitive amplifier Ortec 142pc. Besides the maximum achievable gain\nmeasurements it was also very important to evaluate the spark protective properties of\nthe resistive mesh. For this we used the same electronic circuit as in [5] in which was\ncompared the charge deposited by sparks in a conventional MICROMEGAS and in a\nMICROMEGAS with the anode coated by resistive Kapton. This allows us to correctly\ncompare our results obtained with the resistive cathode mesh with their results obtained\nwith the resistive anode.\u2217\nIn complementary measurements the spark energy was also independently evaluated by\nits light emission; for this a photomultiplier EMI-9426 was used (see Fig.3)\n\n\u2217\n\nNote that in the past in similar comparative studies performed with TGEMs and RETGEMs we used a\ncurrent amplifier with a changeable feedback resistor which allowed us to measure the spark current values\nin a large interval. In the case of measuring high currents the low resistor should be used and the energy\nreleased by the spark was so high that it could damage the metallic mesh of the conventional\nMICROMEGAS. Thus the circuit shown in fig.4 was more adequate for these particular measurements.\n\n\fFig. 4. A schematic of the circuit used for measurements of the charge released by\nsparks (see [5] for more details).\n\n3. Preliminary results\nMost of the tests were done in Ar+5%isobutane.This mixture was chosen in order to\ncompare our results with the earlier published data for bulk MICROMEGAS with a\nmetallic mesh(see for example [3]).\nFig.5 shows gain vs. voltage curves measured in Ar+isobutane with the RMMICROMEGAS and with the conventional bulk MICROMEGAS using 241Am and 55Fe\nradioactive sources. In the case of the Am source we were able to observe signals in\nionization chamber mode (at gas gain of one). With the voltage increase the\nmultiplication starts and the gas gain as a function of the voltage V was defined as:\nA(V)= S(V)g/S(V)i,\nwhere Sg(V) and Si(V) are the signal amplitudes measured in the case of gas\nmultiplication and in the ionization chamber mode respectively.\nAt gas gains of more than hundred 55Fe was used. The gas gain in this case was evaluated\nfrom the known sensitivity of the preamplifier (calibrated by a standard method of the\ncharge injection into the preamplifier/detector input). The highest points on the gas gain\ncurves measured with 55Fe corresponds to the situation when the first signs of detector\ninstability appear. Usually at ~20V higher voltage breakdowns may appear at a rate of\nabout a few per 10 min. Their rate then sharply increases with voltage.\nAs can be seen from the curves presented in Figure 5, the maximum gas gain (~104)\nachieved with RM-MICROMEGAS is only two times less then that measured with the\nconventional MICROMEGAS; the last one has the maximum achievable gain\ncomparable to one published in [3].\nNote that the maximum achievable gain of RM-MICROMEGAS may depend on the gas\nmixture. For example, Fig. 6 depicts gain vs. voltage curves measured in Ne+7%CH4\nand inAr+7%CH4; as can be seen the maximum achievable gain in Ar+7%CH4 is about a\nfactor of 10 less than in Ar+5%isobutae or in Ne+7%CH4.\n\n\fThe energy resolution measured when tall the detector area was illuminated by 55Fe was\nabout 30%FWHM (see Fig.7).\nThe rate characteristics of the RM-MICROMEGAS (the signal amplitudes vs. the\ncounting rate) are presented in Figure 8. As can be seen no significant reduction in pulse\namplitude was observed up to counting rates of 104Hz/cm2.\nThe results of the measurements of the charge deposited by sparks in RMMICROMEGAS and in the conventional MICROMEGAS were very similar to those\nobtained in [5]: the charge released by sparks in RM-MICROMEGAS was typically\nabout ~1010 electrons which is at least100 times less than in MICROMEGAS with a\nmetallic cathode mesh (usually \u22651012 electrons). Qualitatively this was confirmed by\nmeasurements performed with the photomultiplier: typically the spark light emission in\nRM-MICROMEGAS was at least 10 times less than in the conventional one. Thus RMMICROMGAS can operate at gas gains as high as the conventional MICROMEGAS.\nHowever in the case of sparks the resistive mesh considerably reduces their energy,\nmaking the detector spark-protected.\n1.00E+05\n\nGain\n\n1.00E+04\nMICROMEGAS\n\n1.00E+03\n1.00E+02\n\nRM-MICROMEGAS\n\n1.00E+01\n1.00E+00\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nVoltage (V)\n\nFig.5.

This\napproach could be complementary to ongoing efforts performed by various groups within\nthe framework of the RD51 collaboration to develop MICROMEGAS and other types of\ngaseous detectors with the resistive electrodes.\nReferences:\n[1] P.
