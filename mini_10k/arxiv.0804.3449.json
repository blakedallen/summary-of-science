The explanation of this acceleration\nin the context of general relativity has stimulated a myriad of ideas, the most notable of which is\nthe introduction of a mysterious cosmic fluid, the so-called dark energy [3]. In more recent times,\nmodified theories of gravity, constructed by adding correction terms to the usual Einstein-Hilbert\naction, have opened a new window to study the accelerated expansion of the universe where it has\nbeen shown that such correction terms could give rise to accelerating solutions of the field equations\nwithout having to invoke concepts such as dark energy [4].\nIn a more general setting, one can use a generic function, f (R), instead of the usual Ricci scalar R\nas the action for the model. Such f (R) gravity theories have been extensively studied in the literature\nover the past few years. In finding the dynamical equations of motion one can vary the action\nwith respect to the metric (metric formalism), or view the metric and connections as independent\ndynamical variables and vary the action with respect to both independently (Palatini formalism)\n[5]. In this theory, the Palatini form of the action is shown to be equivalent to a scalar-tensor type\ntheory from which the scalar field kinetic energy is absent. This is achieved by introducing a conformal\ntransformation in which the conformal factor is taken as an auxiliary scalar field [6]. As is well known,\nin the usual Einstein-Hilbert action these two approaches give the same field equations. However, in\nf (R) gravity the Palatini formalism leads to different dynamical equations due to nonlinear terms\nin the action. There is also a third version of f (R) gravity in which the Lagrangian of the matter\ndepends on the connections of the metric (metric-affine formalism) [7].\nIn this letter we consider an (n+1)-dimensional flat FRW space-time in the framework of the\nmetric formalism of f (R) gravity. Following [8], we set up an effective Lagrangian in which the scale\nfactor a and Ricci scalar R play the role of independent dynamical variables. This Lagrangian is\nconstructed in such a way that its variation with respect to a and R yields the correct equations of\nmotion as that of an action with a generic f (R) mentioned above. The form of the function f (R)\n\u2217\n\nemail: b-vakili@sbu.ac.ir\n\n\fappearing in the modified action is then found by demanding that the Lagrangian admits the desired\nNoether symmetry [9]. By the Noether symmetry of a given minisuperspace cosmological model we\nmean that there exists a vector field X, as the infinitesimal generator of the symmetry on the tangent\nspace of the configuration space such that the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to this\nvector field vanishes. For a study of the Noether symmetry in various cosmological models see [10].\nWe shall see that by demanding the Noether symmetry as a feature of the Lagrangian of the model\nunder consideration, we can obtain the explicit form of the function f (R). Since the existence of a\nsymmetry results in a constant of motion, we can integrate the field equations which would then lead\nto a power law expansion of the universe.\n\n2\n\nThe phase space of the model\n\nIn this section we consider a spatially flat FRW cosmology within the framework of f (R) gravity.\nSince our goal is to study models which exhibit Noether symmetry, we do not include any matter\ncontribution in the action. Let us start from the (n+1)-dimensional action (we work in units where\nc = 16\u03c0G = 1)\nZ\n\u221a\n(1)\nS = dn+1 x \u2212gf (R),\nwhere R is the scalar curvature and f (R) is an arbitrary function of R. By varying the above action\nwith respect to metric we obtain the equation of motion as\n1\ng\u03bc\u03bd f (R) \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd f \u2032 (R) + \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f \u2032 (R) \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2737f \u2032 (R) = 0,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a prime represents differentiation with respect to R. We assume that the geometry of spacetime is described by the flat FRW metric which seems to be consistent with the present cosmological\nobservations\nn\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t)\n\nX\n\n(dxi )2 .\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nWith this background geometry the field equations read\n1\n1\nn(n \u2212 1) 2\nH = \u2212 \u2032 f \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u1e582 + (n \u2212 1)H \u1e58f \u2032\u2032 + f \u2032\u2032 R\u0308 + (f \u2212 Rf \u2032 ) ,\n(n \u2212 1)\u1e22 +\n2\nf\n2\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nH2 =\n\nh\ni\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n(f\nR\n\u2212\nf\n)\n\u2212\n2n\n\u1e58Hf\n,\nn(n \u2212 1)f \u2032\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter and a dot represents differentiation with respect to t. To\nstudy the symmetries of the minisuperspace under consideration, we need an effective Lagrangian\nfor the model whose variation with respect to its dynamical variables yields the correct equations of\nmotion. Following [8], by considering the action described above as representing a dynamical system\nin which the scale factor a and scalar curvature R play the role of independent dynamical variables,\nwe can rewrite action (1) as [11]\nS=\n\nZ\n\ndtL(a, \u0227, R, \u1e58) =\n\nZ\n\n(\n\n\"\n\n\u00e4\n\u02272\ndt a f (R) \u2212 \u03bb R \u2212 n(n \u2212 1) 2 \u2212 2n\na\na\nn\n\n#)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere we introduce the definition of R in terms of a and its derivatives as a constraint. This procedure\nallows us to remove the second order derivatives from action (6). The Lagrange multiplier \u03bb can be\nobtained by variation with respect to R, that is, \u03bb = an f \u2032 (R). Thus, we obtain the following\nLagrangian for the model [8, 11]\nL(a, \u0227, R, \u1e58) = n(n \u2212 1)\u02272 an\u22122 f \u2032 + 2n\u0227\u1e58an\u22121 f \u2032\u2032 + an (f \u2032 R \u2212 f ).\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe momenta conjugate to variables a and R are\npa =\n\n\u2202L\n= 2n(n \u2212 1)\u0227an\u22122 f \u2032 + 2nan\u22121 \u1e58f \u2032\u2032 ,\n\u2202 \u0227\n\n(8)\n\n\u2202L\n= 2n\u0227an\u22121 f \u2032\u2032 .\n(9)\n\u2202 \u1e58\nThe Hamiltonian corresponding to Lagrangian (7) can then be written in terms of a, \u0227, R and \u1e58 as\npR =\n\nH(a, \u0227, R, \u1e58) = n(n \u2212 1)\u02272 an\u22122 f \u2032 + 2n\u0227\u1e58an\u22121 f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 an (f \u2032 R \u2212 f ).\n\n(10)\n\nTherefore, our cosmological setting is equivalent to a dynamical system where the phase space is\nspanned by {a, R, pa , pR } with Lagrangian (7) describing the dynamics with respect to time t. Now,\nit is easy to see that variation of Lagrangian (7) with respect to R gives the following well-known\nrelation for the scalar curvature\nR = n(n \u2212 1)\n\n\u02272\n\u00e4\n+ 2n ,\n2\na\na\n\n(11)\n\nwhile variation with respect to a yields the field equation (4). Also, equation (5) is nothing but the\nzero energy condition H = 0 (Hamiltonian constraint). A quantum f (R) cosmological model based\non Hamiltonian (10) can be found in [12].\nThe setup for constructing the phase space and writing the Lagrangian is now complete. In the\nnext section we shall use the above Lagrangian to find the form of f (R) that would admit a Noether\nsymmetry.\n\n3\n\nThe Noether symmetry\n\nAs is well known, Noether symmetry approach is a powerful tool in finding the solution to a given\nLagrangian, including the one presented above. In this approach, one is concerned with finding\nthe cyclic variables related to conserved quantities and consequently reducing the dynamics of the\nsystem to a manageable one. The investigation of Noether symmetry in the model presented above is\ntherefore the goal we shall pursue in this section. Here our aim is to find the function f (R) such that\nthe corresponding Lagrangian exhibits the desired symmetry. Following [9], we define\nthe Noether\n\u0010\n\u0011\nsymmetry induced on the model by a vector field X on the tangent space T Q = a, R, \u0227, \u1e58 of the\nconfiguration space Q = (a, R) of Lagrangian (7) through\nX=\u03b1\n\n\u2202\nd\u03b1 \u2202\nd\u03b2 \u2202\n\u2202\n+\u03b2\n+\n+\n,\n\u2202a\n\u2202R\ndt \u2202 \u0227\ndt \u2202 \u1e58\n\n(12)\n\nsuch that the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to this vector field vanishes\nLX L = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nd\nIn (12), \u03b1 and \u03b2 are functions of a and R and dt\nrepresents the Lie derivative along the dynamical\nvector field, that is,\n\u2202\n\u2202\nd\n= \u0227\n+ \u1e58\n.\n(14)\ndt\n\u2202a\n\u2202R\nIt is easy to find the constants of motion corresponding to such a symmetry. Indeed, equation (13)\ncan be rewritten as\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202L d\u03b2 \u2202L\n\u2202L d\u03b1 \u2202L\n+\n+\n+ \u03b2\n= 0.\n(15)\nLX L = \u03b1\n\u2202a\ndt \u2202 \u0227\n\u2202R\ndt \u2202 \u1e58\n\nNoting that\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202q\n\n=\n\ndpq\ndt ,\n\nwe have\ndpR d\u03b2\ndpa d\u03b1\n+\npa + \u03b2\n+\npR = 0,\n\u03b1\ndt\ndt\ndt\ndt\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhich yields\n\nd\n(\u03b1pa + \u03b2pR ) = 0.\ndt\n\n(17)\n\nQ = \u03b1pa + \u03b2pR .\n\n(18)\n\nThus, the constants of motion are\nIn order to obtain the functions \u03b1 and \u03b2 we use equation (15).

Thus, we\nremove the case f \u2032\u2032 = 0 from our consideration.

It is remarkable from (48) that\nthe condition under which the universe would accelerate is 2(3n\u22121)\nn2 \u22121 > 1, that is, n \u2264 5. This means\nthat models with spatial dimension n \u2264 5 obey an accelerated power law expansion while for n > 5\na decelerated expansion occurs.\n\n4\n\nThe equation of state parameter\n\nOne of the advantages of f (R) theories of gravity is that they can describe and provide gravitational\nalternative for dark energy. Indeed, the equations of motion resulting from f (R) gravity admit such\n\n\fsolutions which predict the same accelerated expansion as those resulting from the usual EinsteinHilbert gravity with dark energy. In other words, in the context of f (R) cosmology one can describe\nthe accelerated expansion of the universe without the necessity to introduce the exotic fluid with a\nnegative equation of state (EoS) parameter w. To introduce an effective EoS parameter in our model,\none may compare the field equations (4) and (5) with the usual field equations of a flat FRW universe\nfilled with a perfect fluid with EoS P = w\u03c1, that is, with 3H 2 \u223c \u03c1 and \u22122\u1e22 \u2212 3H 2 \u223c P . This\ncomparison shows that in our model one may introduce the effective energy density and pressure as\nfollows\n\u0001\n1\nRf \u2032 \u2212 f \u2212 nH \u1e58f \u2032\u2032 ,\n(49)\n\u03c1=\n2\n\u0001\n1\nP = f \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u1e582 + (n \u2212 1)H \u1e58f \u2032\u2032 + R\u0308f \u2032\u2032 +\nf \u2212 Rf \u2032 .\n(50)\n2\nTherefore, we can define the effective EoS parameter wef f as\nwef f =\n\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u1e582 + (n \u2212 1)H \u1e58f \u2032\u2032 + R\u0308f \u2032\u2032 + 12 (f \u2212 Rf \u2032 )\nP\n.\n=\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c1\n2 (Rf \u2212 f ) \u2212 nH \u1e58f\n\n(51)\n\nTo transform the above expression to a more manageable form, consider the quantity F = f \u2032 (R) [8].\nIn terms of F, equation (51) takes the form\nwef f = \u22121 +\n\n2\nF\u0308 \u2212 H \u1e1e\n.\nn(n \u2212 1) FH 2\n\n(52)\n\nFor the problem at hand, taking into account that\nf \u2032 (R) =\n\nn\u22121\n2n\nR n+1 ,\nn+1\n\n(53)\n\nand with the help of equation (44) we obtain\nF =\u2212\n\nn + 1 \u22122 n\u22121\nQt n+1 .\n4n\n\n(54)\n\nThus, substituting (54) and H = \u0227/a from (48) we are led to the following EoS parameter\nwef f = \u22121 +\n\n(n \u2212 1)(n + 1)\n.\nn(3n \u2212 1)\n\n(55)\n\nNow, it is easy to see that \u22121 < wef f < 0, which is the characteristic of one type of dark energy,\nthe so-called quintessence. Note that when wef f is less than \u22121, the EoS describes another type\nof dark energy known as phantom. As is clear from equation (55), the effective EoS parameter is\nalways greater than \u22121 and thus in the model under consideration here, the phantom phase cannot\nbe accounted for.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this letter we have studied a generic f (R) cosmological model with an eye to Noether symmetry.\nFor the background geometry, we have considered a flat (n+1)-dimensional FRW metric and derived\nthe general equations of motion in this background. The phase space was then constructed by taking\nthe scale factor a and Ricci scalar R as the independent dynamical variables. The Lagrangian of\nthe model in the configuration space spanned by {a, R} is so constructed such that its variation\nwith respect to these dynamical variables yields the correct field equations. The existence of Noether\nsymmetry implies that the Lie derivative of this Lagrangian with respect to the infinitesimal generator\nof the desired symmetry vanishes. By applying this condition to the Lagrangian of the model, we have\n\n\fobtained the explicit form of the corresponding f (R) function. We have shown that this form of f (R)\nresults in a power law expansion for the scale factor of the universe and the expansion is accelerating\nin the case of n \u2264 5. We have also presented an effective EoS parameter for our f (R) cosmology\nmodel. Our analysis shows that the EoS parameter is always greater than \u22121 and thus the so-called\nphantom dark energy cannot be described in this kind of modified gravity. On the other hand, the\nEoS parameter is restricted to the interval \u22121 < wef f < 0. Since this interval is characteristic of the\nquintessence dark energy, our f (R) model can provide a natural gravitational alternative for this kind\nof dark energy without the necessity to introduce an exotic fluid with a negative EoS parameter.\nAcknowledgement\nThe author would like to thank H.R.
