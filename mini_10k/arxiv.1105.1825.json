Abstract\nWe detected peaks of oscillatory power at 3 and \u223c 6.5 minutes in the umbra of\nthe central sunspot of the active region NOAA AR 10707 in data obtained in the\nnear infrared (NIR) continuum at 1565.7 nm. The NIR dataset captured umbral\ndynamics around 50 km below the \u03c4500 = 1 level. The umbra does not oscillate as a\nwhole, but rather in distinct parts that are distributed over the umbral surface. The\nmost powerful oscillations, close to a period of \u223c 6.5, do not propagate upward. We\nnoted a plethora of large umbral dots that persisted for \u2265 30 minutes and stayed in\nthe same locations. The peaks of oscillatory power above the detected umbral dots\nare located at 3 and 5 minutes oscillations, but are very weak in comparison with the\noscillations of \u223c 6.5 minutes.\nwith velocity amplitudes of about 75 m/s\n(Lites, 1992).\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, there\nare two postulated mechanisms for the\ngeneration of umbral oscillations. One\nis that they are generated on subphotospheric levels by a common extended source (Rouppe van der Voort et\nal. 2003; Bogdan and Judge, 2006) and\npropagate upward along the magnetic\nfield lines (L\u00f3pez Aristre et al., 2001).\nThe other postulate suggests that umbral oscillations are generated when slow\nmode waves are trapped within a cavity\n\n2. Introduction\nThe umbra, the darkest part of a\nsunspot, has complex dynamics. The umbral oscillations, part of the umbral dynamics, have been the subject of many\nresearch studies. At chromospheric levels, researchers have observed velocity oscillations with periods close to 3 minutes and velocity amplitudes of about 6\nkm/s (Balthasar and Wiehr, 1984; Soltau\nand Wiehr, 1984; Tirospula et al., 2000).\nAt the photospheric level, umbral oscillations have periods closer to 5 minutes,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. AND\u0304 I\u01061 , W. CAO1 , P. R. GOODE1\n\nin the umbra's chromosphere. Broadband\nacoustic noise from the convection zone\nexcites the trapped waves (Zhugzhda et\nal.,1983). Lites (1986) found that the 5\nminute photospheric oscillations do not\ndrive the 3 minute chromospheric umbral\noscillations.\nThe umbra does not oscillate as the\nwhole, but in distinct areas within the\numbra (Socas-Navarro et al.\n2009).\nSocas-Navarro et al. (2009) found that\nthe umbra is tremendously dynamic and\nrequires a time cadence faster than 20 s to\nresolve the apparent motions of the emission source.\nUmbral dots (UDs), small-scale structures distributed across the umbra, are\npart of umbral dynamics. Sch\u00fcssler and\nV\u00f6gler, (2006) showed that the appearance of UDs is a natural consequence of\nmagnetoconvection under the influence of\na strong magnetic field. This was confirmed by Cheung et al. (2010) and\nBharti et al. (2010). Heinemann et al.\n(2007) stated that UDs are caused by\noverturning convection.\nBalthasar and Wiehr (1984) stated\nthat the lifetime of UDs is on the order of 20 minutes. Rimmele (2008), Riethm\u00fcller et al. (2008), and Ortiz et\nal. (2010) observed the signature of UDs\ndynamics, as described by the model of\nSch\u00fcssler and V\u00f6gler (2006). Rimmele\n(2008) noted that UDs have a lifetime\nclose to 30 minutes, as predicted by the\nmodel of Sch\u00fcssler and V\u00f6gler (2006).\nBharti et al. (2010) similarly predicted\nthat the average UD's lifetime is between\n25 and 28 minutes. On the other hand,\n\nHamedivafa (2008) stated that the average lifetime of the UDs is between 7 and\n10 minutes, while Watanabe et al. (2009)\nmeasured the average lifetime as 7.3 minutes.\nSocas-Navarro et al. (2009) detected\na movement of the bright umbral elements. They registered horizontal propagation speeds of 30 km/s and stated that\ntheir cadence of 20 s is not enough to resolve the fast lateral motion of the oscillatory sources in the umbra.\nIn this work, we present observations\nof UDs and umbral oscillations at a level\nof 50 km below the \u03c4500 = 1. The NIR\ncontinuum provides easier seeing correction with adaptive optics (AO), and much\nlower scattered light, both instrumental\nand atmospheric. Hence we were able\nto observe structures near the telescope's\ndiffraction limit for this wavelength even\nwithout image reconstruction.\n\n3. Observations and Data analysis\nHigh-resolution photometric observations of the solar active region NOAA\nAR10707 were obtained simultaneously\nin G-band and the near infrared (NIR)\ncontinuum near 1.6\u03bcm with the Dunn\nSolar Telescope (DST) at the National\nSolar Observatory/Sacramento Peak\n(NSO/SP) on December 1, 2004. Benefiting from a high order AO system, the\nspatial resolution was close to the diffraction limit of the 76 cm aperture DST\nin the NIR continuum, but significantly\npoorer for G-band.\n\n\fUMBRAL DYNAMICS IN THE NEAR INFRARED CONTINUUM\n\nTo probe the deepest layer of the solar\natmosphere, exploiting the Sun's opacity minimum at 1.6\u03bcm, NIR photometry\nwas employed, which consists of a tuneable NIR birefringent Lyot filter developed by the Center for Solar-Terrestrial\nResearch/NJIT (Cao et al. 2006), an interference filter with a 5 nm bandpass,\nand a NIR camera. The Lyot filter has a\nvery narrow bandpass of 0.25 nm and was\ntuned to the line-free continuum at 1565.7\nnm. The NIR camera (Cao et al. 2005) is\nbased on a 1024 \u00d7 1024 HgCdTe/Al2O3\nCMOS focal plane array with a liquid nitrogen cooling system. The pixel size is\n18\u03bcm\u00d718\u03bcm. The output signal is digitalised into 14-bits with a dynamic range\nbetter than 70 dB.\nThe field of view (FOV) was 122\u2032\u2032 \u00d7122\u2032\u2032\nand 105\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 105\u2032\u2032 for the NIR and the\nG-band, respectively. Ten NIR frames\nwere obtained every second, and the best\nframe was selected. The G-band data\nset had a cadence of 0.5 s. All images\nwere dark- and flat-field corrected and selected according to the highest root mean\nsquare (RMS) contrast. The observational run started on 16:54 UT and produced datasets 30 minutes long.\nTo equalise the time cadence of both\ndatasets, we took every second image\nfrom the G-band dataset, achieving a 1\ns cadence. Thus in both dataset we acquired a Nyquist period of 2 s.\nThe data were co-aligned using a\nFourier coaligning routine; which uses\ncross-correlation techniques and squared\nmean absolute deviations to provide subpixel coalignment precision. However, we\n\n3\n\ndid not implement sub-pixel image shifting, to avoid substantial interpolation errors that sometimes accompany the use\nof this technique. The reference image for\ncoaligning routine was the floating mean;\nwe made a mean image for each interval\nof 30 data images, shifting the interval\nby one image over the time series. Destretching of the images was performed\nto eliminate the influence of seeing distortions. The de-stretching routine uses\nbilinear interpolation. The reference image for the de-stretching routine is the\nfloating mean; we made a mean image for\neach interval of 10 data images, shifting\nthe interval by one image over the time\nseries.\nWavelet analysis based on work of Torrence and Compo (1998) was applied.\nThe wavelet analysis most useful output is the power of the detected oscillatory signal that is related to the amplitude of the analysed oscillatory signal.\n(Vigouroux and Delache, 1993; Graps,\n1995; Starch et al. 1997). In our analysis we used power of the oscillations as\nthe main product of the wavelet analysis. The oscillatory detection was performed with use of the Morlet wavelet as\nthe mother wavelet:\n(1)\n\n1\n\nt2\n\n\u03c80 (t) = \u03c0 \u2212 4 ei\u03c90 t e\u2212 2 ,\n\nwhere \u03c90 is the non-dimensional frequency and t the non-dimensional time\nparameter.\nMorlet wavelet is nonorthogonal, based on the Gaussian function and very close to the limit\n\u221a of the\nsignal processing uncertainty, ( \u03c0). An\nassociated Fourier period, P, corresponds\n\n\fA. AND\u0304 I\u01061 , W. CAO1 , P. R. GOODE1\n\n4\n\nto 1.03s, where s is the wavelet scale.\nThe wavelet transform is a convolution of\nthe time series with the analysing wavelet\nfunction. The complete wavelet transform is achieved by varying the wavelet\nscale, which controls both the period and\ntemporal extent of the function. Only\none-dimensional wavelet analysis is done\nfor each spatial coordinate. At the beginning and end of the wavelet transforms\nare regions where spurious power may\narise as a direct result of the finite extent\nof the time series. Those regions are usually refereed to as the cone of influence\n(COI), having a temporal extent equal to\nthe e-folding time of the wavelet function.\nFor the case of our wavelet is:\n\n(2)\n\ntd =\n\n\u221a\n\n2s =\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n\nP\n,\n1.03\n\nThis time scale is the response of the\nwavelet function to noise spikes and is\nused in our detection criteria by requiring\nthat oscillations have a duration greater\nthan td . The finite nature of our time\nseries compelled us to impose the maximum period of 12 minutes above which\nwe did not accept any detection. The\napproach to automated wavelet analysis\nused here and all the imposed restrictions are detailed in Andic et al. (2010).\nSince the data used contained seeing distortions, we took into considerations only\nthe oscillations that had 99% confidence\nlevels.\nThe diameter of the UDs was measured as the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of a spatial profile that\ncontained the maximum intensity of the\n\nstructure. This analysis was performed at\nthe frame with the best contrast. Determination of the lifetime and the UDs shift\nin the horizontal plane was performed\nwith the nonlinear affine velocity estimator (NAVE) method (Chae and Sakurai,\n2008), which tracked the detected structures through the dataset.\nThe areas surrounding the umbra were\nmasked out with a binary mask. We\nmade an average frame over the time\nseries and normalised it to the maximum. Then, we multiplied all pixels with\nbrightness \u2265 0.75 by 0 and darker pixels\nby 1, masking out in such way everything\nbut umbra.\nFor the phase analysis of the oscillations two methods were applied. One is\nwavelet phase analysis between NIR and\nG-band data sets. This phase analysis\nis similar to the Fourier phase analysis,\nonly it provides time and frequency localisation. This localisation is provided by\nthe use of wave packets by wavelet analysis instead of the infinite wave train of\nFourier analysis. The difference in cyclic\nphase, \u2206\u03c6 can be determined for each frequency component, \u03bd, using the phase information contained within the complex\nwavelet transform. The quality of the\nvalues is represented by phase coherence.\nA time series in this work are extracted\nfrom the same (x,y) pixel location in both\ndatasets. The signals are separated in\nthe direction normal to the solar surface.\nTherefore, the phase differences can be\ninterpreted as delays caused by the finite\npropagation speed of waves traveling between the optical formation heights. The\n\n\fUMBRAL DYNAMICS IN THE NEAR INFRARED CONTINUUM\n\nautomated method used is described in\ndetail in Bloomfield et al. (2004).\nThe second method was combining the\nFourier and Hilbert transform on a single\ndataset (White and Cha, 1973). In short,\nthe signal is a complex function. The real\npart is original signal and imaginary part\nis the quadrature of the original signal.\nSince a real function and its quadrature\nare Hilbert transform pairs, the Hilbert\ntransform converts one into another. Resulting transform describes the amplitude\nand phase of a variable in complex plane.\nThe signal is transformed into the Fourier\nspace then transformed back using the\nHilbert transform (Stebbins and Goode,\n1987).\nThe phase angle spectrum is formed\nin such way that an upward propagating wave has a positive phase angle. The\nphase angles are presented in a weighted\ndiagram, where weighting is applied\n\u221a per\nsample by cross-power amplitude P1 P2\nto produce greyscale phase, \u2206\u03c6 (Lites\nand Chipman 1979).\n4. Results\nThe target of our analysis, the umbra\nof the central spot of AR 10707 (Fig. 1A),\nwas full of UDs.\nWe observed and analysed 70 easily resolved UDs. The UDs were long lived,\n80% of them existed during our entire\ntime series of \u223c 30 min. During our time\nseries, those 80% of UDs stayed in the\nsame locations (Fig.2).\n\n5\n\nThe average size of UDs detected in\nthis dataset is 0.86\u2032\u2032; double the Dawes'\nlimit for the Dunn telescope in NIR continuum. Since we analyse objects that are\nclose to each other, the Dawes' resolution\nlimit is appropriate for our dataset. All\nthe sizes of the values below Dawes' limit\nwere ignored.\nWe analysed the NIR continuum data\nset and G-band data set with wavelet\nanalysis. The signal to noise ratio of our\nG-band data was poor since the seeing\nwas not good during our observational\nrun. Hence we used the G-band data only\nas test data for analysis methods. The\ndata sets were 30 minutes long, making\nthe highest credible period in this dataset\n12 minutes. With the limitation to the\nperiod of 12 minutes we avoided the spurious oscillations that rise in the COI due\nto the finite nature of our time series. To\navoid noise induced detections near the\nNyquist frequency, we ignored oscillations\nthat did not contain at least 23 points in\na single period. Thus we analysed oscillations in the period range of 0.75 to 12\nminutes.\nThe NIR continuum shows two strong\npeaks of oscillatory power at 3 and \u223c 6.5\nminute (Fig.3, solid line). The G-band\ndata set (Fig.3, dashed line) shows previously reported peaks at 3 and 5 minute\n(Balthasar and Wiehr, 1984; Lites, 1992;\nTirospula et al., 2000) but no significant\npower at \u223c 6.5 minute.\n\n\f6\n\nA.

Arrow at each frame marks an example UDs, in this instance twin UDs.\nAll selected frames have a contrast above 90% of maximum contrast.\nThe marked UDs stay in the same position for the duration of the time\nseries.\nThe oscillations were separately calculated for UDs. The NAVE method provides, beside the tracking coordinates of\nthe structures, also the intensity changes\nof the structure through the time with the\nintensity error. We performed wavelet\nanalysis on each of the UDs intensity\ncurves to detect the oscillations emitted\nby UDs (Fig.4A). The power curve for the\nUDs shows a significantly smaller oscillatory power than the power emitted by\nthe whole umbra. The maximum power\npeak for UDs emitted oscillations is at\n\n\u223c 1 min, with a broad peak that covers periods from \u223c 2 to \u223c 3 minutes,\nfinishing with the peak at \u223c 5 min period. The registered power is close to\nthe noise level, since the intensity error\nis \u223c 20% (Fig.4B). The oscillatory curve\nof NIR continuum shows the power peak\nat 3 minutes period with another broad\npeak around 6 minutes. The small peak\nat the 3 minute most probably represents\noscillations emitted by UD. The other,\nmore powerful oscillations registered in\nthe other peak might, in part, originate\n\n\f8\n\nA.

The solid\nline represents the power observed in the NIR continuum, while the\ndashed line represents the power in G-band.\nfrom a different source. Considering the\ndepth of the spectral line formation layer,\nwe can speculate that the observed oscillations have a close connection to helioseismic oscillations. The spectrum of\nthe helioseismic oscillations arises from\nmodes with periods ranging from about\n1.5 minute to about 20 minute (Gough\nand Toomre, 1991). The observed oscillatory peak may be a consequence of the\nplasma conditions and the shape of the\ncavity below the umbra.\nDue to seeing conditions, the G-band\ndata induce too large error into the phase\ndifference calculations designed to determine if there is wave propagation. The\numbra observed in our G-band data set\n\ndid not show any distinguishing substructures or umbral flashes. We used a combination of the Fourier and Hilbert transform to obtain the amplitudes and phases\nof the oscillations on both levels (Fig. 5).\nAt the NIR level, the oscillations with\nsignificant power have a phase of 0o . The\nrange of the phase angle for all registered\noscillations is from \u22120.29o to 0o . From\nthis range, 89% of pixels in the umbra\nhave 0o phase, i.e. the registered waves\nare not propagating in any direction. The\n11% of the pixels in umbra show signals\nof downward propagation with the phase\nangle less than 0.5o, indicating velocities\n< 1 m/s.\n\n\fUMBRAL DYNAMICS IN THE NEAR INFRARED CONTINUUM\n\n9\n\nFigure 4.

A small phase angle can be caused\nwith the excessive noise in G-band data and not the result of real\nwave propagation. Positive phase difference indicates upward wave\npropagation.\ncalculations showed a very slight phase\ndifference angle, less than 0.5o (Fig. 6).\nThis small angle might be caused by the\nexcessive noise in G-band dataset or by\nthe small effects of dissipation through\nthe atmosphere and not the true wave\npropagation. Hence we cannot state that\nthere is a connection between oscillations\ndetected in both spectral bands.\nThese findings indicate that there is no\nobservable wave propagation between the\nlevels. However, due to the high noise levels in G-band data, this observation has\nto be reevaluated with another dataset.\nThe oscillations observed in the NIR\ncontinuum dataset are distributed over\n\nthe whole umbra. To ensure that the\noscillations we analysed are real, we\nstrengthened the restrictions for automated wavelet technique, as well as the\nprocedures for the preparation of time\nsets. Use of de-stretching procedure reduces the possibility of intensity oscillations induced by shifting the object along\nthe X-Y plane (where X and Y stand for\nthe spatial coordinates). However, the\ninduced intensity oscillations could not\nbe 100% removed, because the alignment\nand de-stretching were not performed at\nsub-pixel values.\n\n\fUMBRAL DYNAMICS IN THE NEAR INFRARED CONTINUUM\n\nThe umbra emits oscillations sporadically over the time (Fig. 7). There are\nno constant oscillatory sources. Hence we\ncan state that over the time the oscillatory emission in the NIR continuum level\nis random for almost all periods. However, we have to limit this statement. Our\ntime series is short and cannot cover the\nlonger period oscillations for more than\nfew periods; hence we could not draw\nreliable conclusion about the behaviour\nof the longer period oscillations over the\ntime.\nWe also checked the spatial distribution of the dominant oscillation frequency\nacross the umbra (Fig. 8). The umbra does not oscillate as a whole but\nin patches which are distributed across\nthe umbra. For each pixel in the umbra, we marked the period of the registered oscillations that carried the most\npower. That period was declared dominant for that analysed pixel. Each patch\nin the umbra emits oscillations over the\nwhole period range we analysed, however\nthe maximum power is contained within\ndiffered period oscillations for the neighbouring patches. We could not detect a\nconnection of the period preference and\nthe structures of the umbra.\nThe patches are clearly defined and\nseparated from each other with a sharp\nchange in the oscillatory period. Some\nof the patches that oscillate with the low\nperiod oscillations have a gradual transition from one period oscillations to another within the patch itself, but still end\nabruptly at the edge.\n\n11\n\nSpatially these patches do not correspond to anything special inside the umbra, and cannot be connected with either\nUD or the spaces between. Some of the\nlow period oscillations are connected with\nthe observed UDs, however some of the\nUDs have short period oscillations. What\ncauses the difference, we do not know.\nWe hope that with the higher resolution,\nwe will be able to resolve the cause of the\ndifference in the patches.\n5. Discussion and Conclusions\nWe observed well-defined UDs in the\nNIR continuum level, 50 km below \u03c4500 =\n1, and we detected oscillations in the umbra with power peaking at 3 and \u223c 6.5\nminutes.\nThe UDs were distributed across the\numbra and lasted longer than the duration of our dataset (Fig.2). We did not\nobserve the appearance or disappearance\nof existing prominent UDs. Their average\nsize is 0.8\u2032\u2032 , and during our dataset they\ntended to stay at approximately the same\nlocation (Fig.2). Sch\u00fcssler and V\u00f6gler\n(2006) model of magneto-convection in\nthe umbra predicts that UDs are caused\nby rising plumes. This aspect was confirmed by the observational work of Rimmele (2008), Riethm\u00fcller et al. (2008),\nand Ortiz et al. (2010). In Fig.5 of\nthe work (Sch\u00fcssler and V\u00f6gler, 2006),\nwe can see the rising of a plume and the\ncorresponding appearance of UDs in the\nbrightness images. The lifetime of the average UD should be around 30 minutes\nof detectable brightness according to this\nmodel. However from the figure, it is\n\n\f12\n\nA. AND\u0304 I\u01061 , W. CAO1 , P. R. GOODE1\n\nclear that at lower levels in the umbra\nwe would be able to see UDs for longer\ntime. The example from Sch\u00fcssler and\nV\u00f6gler, (2006) demonstrates that plumes\nexist for almost 40 minutes in the subphotosphere. Moreover, Bharti et al.\n(2010) found that larger UDs live longer.\nWe were only capable of resolving large\nUDs, which were stable for the 30 minute\nduration of our data sequence. Thus, we\ncan speculate that the longevity of the\nobserved UDs is a consequence of efficient\nconvection at the NIR continuum formation level. Although this line of reasoning\nimplies that the same would happen for\nsmaller UD's, we could not observe them,\nhence we cannot broaden the statement\nto include the unobserved UDs.\nOur result disagrees with Hamedivafa\n(2008), who found that the lifetime of\nUDs is between 7 and 10 minutes. However, Hamedivafa expresses doubt about\nhis result, since possible effects were introduced by the automated analysis used\nfor statistical analysis of the UDs. On the\nother hand, Watanabe et al. (2009) also\nused an automated detection code and\nfound the mean lifetime to be 7.3 minutes.\nThe oscillations observed in the NIR\ncontinuum have power peaks at 3 and\n\u223c 6.5 minute period oscillations, while\nthe testing of simultaneous observations\nin the G-band show umbral oscillations\nwith power peaks near 3 and 5 minutes.\nThe observed 3 minute oscillations are\nmost probably connected with the oscillations of the UDs (Fig.4), while the\nbroader peak around 6 minute oscillations\nmight originate from a different source.\n\nWatanabe et al. (2009) found in UDs\nintensity curves low frequency components close to \u223c 8 minutes, while Sobotka\nand Puschmann (2009) reported that\nUDs substructures vary with the time\nscale of \u223c 3 minutes. Thus, we can\nspeculate that observed power peaks in\nthe intensity oscillations could be connected with same physical mechanism\nthat caused the UDs and UD's structures\nto exist and change for the noted period in the spectral lines used in the cited\nworks, but at NIR continuum height we\nsee those as a pure oscillations and not\nthe variations of the UDs and UD's structures.\nOscillations registered in the NIR continuum have small negative phase angle obtained by combining Fourier and\nHilbert transform. Phase angles close\nto zero indicate evanescent waves. The\nphase angle close to zero is observed for\nthe 89% of powerful oscillations indicating that oscillations which contribute the\nmost to the power peak around 6 minute\ndo not propagate upward. The small negative phase angle is most probably associated with dissipation of evanescent waves.\nWe can speculate that these oscillations\nare helioseismic oscillations, which buffet the photosphere and that these oscillations do not have a direct connection\nwith the upward layers. The typical helioseismic oscillations have periods ranging from \u223c 1.5 minute to \u223c 20 minutes\n(Gough and Toomre, 1991). It is possible that the oscillations we observed are\nclosely connected with the condition of\nthe plasma directly below the umbra.\n\n\fUMBRAL DYNAMICS IN THE NEAR INFRARED CONTINUUM\n\nFigure 7. Changes of the observed oscillatory power in the umbra\nover time. We integrated the power for each period individually over\nthe whole surface of the umbra.\n\nFigure 8. Spatial distribution of the dominant oscillation periods\nacross the umbra.\n\n13\n\n\f14\n\nA. AND\u0304 I\u01061 , W. CAO1 , P. R. GOODE1\n\nThe phase angle for the most powerful\noscillations is close to zero and the minimum oscillatory power is larger than the\nmaximum oscillatory power registered in\nG-band. The phase spectra we used in\nthis work weights phase angles with the\npower of the oscillatory signal in question, hence phase angles of the weak oscillations will be lost in our figure. We\nobserved some waves with the positive\nphase angle, indicating upward propagation. However, the weaker power oscillations are closer to the sporadic noise detections of the oscillations and their reliability is questionable. Thus, we cannot\nstate that there is a upward propagation\nof the detected oscillations.\nThe peaks at 3 and 5 minutes observed\nin G-band agree with the previous works\n(Balthasar and Wiehr, 1984; Lites, 1992;\nTirospula et al., 2000), confirming the\naccuracy of our analysis methods. Our\ndata set in G-band has poor S/N (signal to noise) ratio, thus cannot be used\nfor establishing reliable connections between NIR dataset findings and the chromospheric findings.\nThe power curve in Fig. 3 for the\nNIR data set shows power for the 3\nminute oscillations as a small peak. This\npower peak is probably the contribution\nof the oscillations in the UDs. Although\nthis might be taken as a confirmation of\nthe origin of the oscillations from subphotosperic levels (L\u00f3pez Aristre et al.\n2001; Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2003;\nBogdan and Judge, 2006), the low quality of the G-band data did not allow us\nto detect the vertical propagation of these\noscillations and their connection with the\n\nupper atmospheric levels. Hence we cannot present firm proof that umbral oscillations originate on the NIR continuum\nlevel.\nThe question remains about the other\npossible sources of the registered NIR oscillations. The instrumentation and the\noptical bench did not induce any oscillations. However, the dataset consist of\nthe raw data, and the seeing influences\ndiffer from visible (G-band) to NIR spectral lines. Hence, it is necessary to adjust coalignment procedure to include the\nchanges in the NIR, as well as in the visible part of spectra. Change of the interval used for the mean reference image for\nthe coalignment of dataset caused a shift\nin the oscillatory power peak toward the\nlonger periods. With an interval of 10 images (i.e. 20 sec), we got a strong power\npeak around the 10 minute period. With\nthe interval of 20 images (i.e. 40 sec),\nsame peak shifted towards the longer period oscillations peaking at a \u223c 13 minute\nperiod and with the interval of 30 images (i.e. 1 min), the peak shifted to\n\u223c 15 minute period. These oscillations\nwere the strongest around the high contrast areas (i.e. an edge of the umbra).\nThe position of these oscillations and the\nchanges caused by enlarging the image\ninterval indicates that seeing distortions\ncause a shift in the images that might\ncause false oscillatory detections. There\nis a possibility that not even with the 30\nimages interval used for coalignment, we\nwere not completely successful in removing all seeing induced oscillations. Thus,\n\n\fUMBRAL DYNAMICS IN THE NEAR INFRARED CONTINUUM\n\nthese findings have to be reevaluated using a dataset where the seeing influences\nare removed.\nAlthough the whole umbra oscillates,\nthe dominant periods of the oscillations\nare not equally distributed over the umbra (Fig. 8). There are distinct areas\nover the umbra that oscillate within the\nwhole period range we analysed. This result agrees, in part, with Socas-Navarro\net al. (2009), with a slight variation.\nOur patches have different dimensions\nand behave differently than the patches\ndescribed in Socas-Navarro et al. (2009).\nThe difference in the oscillatory patches\nin this work and in the work by SocasNavarro et al. (2009) might be caused by\nthe different height of formation for the\nspectral lines used. NIR spectral band\nused in this work is located deep in the\nphotosphere, and we do not have direct\nconnection to the chromospheric observations. Thus, we cannot say that these\npatches are same as the ones observed in\nthe work by Socas-Navarro et al. (2009).\nThe location of the NIR spectral band\nmight also lead to the speculation that\nthe dominant oscillations with a \u223c 6.5\nminute period are helioseismic oscillations which do not propagate upward,\nwhile the oscillations detected in UD that\nhave peaks close to 3 and 5 minutes might\nbe the oscillations connected with the upper atmospheric layers. However, the\nhigh error in intensity curves of UD points\nto the necessity of checking this finding\nwith some other dataset.\nThanks are due to the anonymous referee, which comments helped improve this\nwork.
