Implications for the spin-dynamical experiments in the iron pnictides\nare discussed.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHigh-temperature superconductivity in the iron\npnictides1,2 arises by doping antiferromagnetic parent\ncompounds3 . Hence, the strength of the electronic correlations, the nature of magnetism, and the relationship\nbetween magnetic excitations and the superconductivity\nare important issues for understanding the emergence of\nhigh temperature superconductivity in these materials.\nIn the parent iron pnictides, the N\u00e9el transition into a\n(\u03c0, 0) antiferromagnet is either preceded by or concomitant with a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition. The (\u03c0, 0) magnetic order by itself can be understood either by invoking a local moment J1 \u2212J2 model4\u201311\nor an itinerant model with nearly nested electron and\nhole pockets12\u201314 .\nThe experimentally observed \"bad metal\" behavior,\nthe Drude-weight suppression15,16 and the temperatureinduced spectral-weight transfer16\u201318 place these materials near to a Mott transition4,9,19,20 ; a Mott insulator can\nemerge when the iron square lattice either expands21 or\ncontains ordered vacancies22 . In a metallic system close\nto a Mott transition, quasi-local moments are expected to\narise; this picture is further supported by the experimental observation of zone boundary spin wave excitations\nin the magnetically ordered state at low temperatures23 .\nThe inelastic neutron scattering experiments demonstrated the need for an anisotropic J1 \u2212 J2 model with\nJ1x 6= J1y , which may reflect an orbital ordering24\u201326\nwhile pointing to the relevance of magnetic frustration\nfrom the extracted ratio (J1x + J1y )/2J2 \u223c 123 . Therefore, results in the tetragonal, paramagnetic phase of the\nparent compounds are of great importance for understanding the relevance of an isotropic J1 \u2212 J2 model as\nwell as the strength of the underlying magnetic frustration. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements\nof Diallo et al.27 on the tetragonal, paramagnetic phase\nof CaFe2 As2 represent a first step in this direction. Even\nabove the concomitant first-order structural and N\u00e9el\ntransition temperature, they have observed anisotropic\nspin dynamics around the (\u03c0, 0) wave vector, and the inferred ratio J1 /J2 \u223c 0.55 is similar to that of the ordered\nphase.\n\nMotivated by these experimental results we study the\nspin dynamics of a two-dimensional J1 \u2212J2 antiferromagnet. While theoretical studies exist on the order-fromdisorder phenomenon and phase diagram of the J1 \u2212 J2\nmodel28,29 , the spin dynamics in the paramagnetic phase\nof the model in the (\u03c0, 0) collinear regime has not yet\nbeen systematically studied. We carry out the calculations using a modified spin wave theory30 , which incorporates the 1/S corrections that are important for capturing the order-from-disorder phenomenon and the associated dynamical properties. We discuss the implications\nof our results for the iron pnictides, including the role of\nitinerant electrons.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the relevant J1 \u2212J2 model and describe the modified\nspin wave theory calculations. In Sec. III we analyze the\nexcitation spectrum obtained from modified spin wave\ntheory, and associated behavior of the spin-spin correlation length. In Sec. IV we analyze the dynamic structure\nfactor calculated by using the modified spin wave theory\nresults. In Sec. V we consider the fluctuation effects due\nto itinerant electrons within a Ginzburg-Landau framework. In Sec. VI we describe the relation between our\ntheoretical results and the experimental data obtained\nin the paramagnetic phase of iron pnictides. We provide\na summary of our work in Sec. VII. The technical details of fitting the experimental data and consideration of\ninter-planar exchange coupling using modified spin wave\ntheory are respectively relegated to Appendix A and Appendix B.\nII.\n\nMODEL AND MODIFIED SPIN WAVE\nTHEORY\n\nThe model is defined by the Hamiltonian\nX\nX\nSi * Sj ,\nS i * S j + J2\nH = J1\nhiji\n\n(1)\n\nhhijii\n\nwhere J1 and J2 respectively denote the antiferromagnetic exchange couplings between spins located in the\nnearest (hiji) and next-nearest neighbor (hhijii) sites on\na square lattice.

The\ndecoupled N\u00e9el sublattices are illustrated in the upper right\ncorner, which also defines the angle \u03c6.\n\nlattice decouples into two independently N\u00e9el ordered,\ninterpenetrating lattices, and the angle \u03c6 between the\nstaggered magnetizations of these two sublattices, as illustrated in the Fig. 1 inset is arbitrary. An order-fromdisorder transition at temperature T\u03c3 breaks the fourfold rotational symmetry of the square lattice down to\na twofold rotational symmetry of the rectangular lattice, and \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0 emerge as degenerate ground states\nat T = 028 . Since quantum fluctuations make \u03b1c > 0.5,\nfor definiteness we will focus on J2 /J1 > 1.\nWe define a local spin quantization axis along the classical ordering direction at each site (\u03a9cl\ni ), as illustrated\nin an inset to Fig. 1. We then introduce the corresponding Dyson-Maleev (DM) boson representation for\n\u2020\nthe spin operators at each site: Si * \u03a9cl\ni = S \u2212a\ni ai , as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2020\n\u2212\nwell as S+\n=\n2S(1\n\u2212\na\na\n/2S)a\nand\nS\n=\n2Sa\u2020i .\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n30\nThe modified spin wave theory treats the self-energy\nof the a-bosons as a static quantity, which renormal-\n\nizes their dispersion; in this respect, it is similar to the\nlarge-N Schwinger boson mean-field theory31 . Following\nTakahashi30,32 , we express the Hamiltonian, Eq. (1), in\nterms of the DM bosons in momentum space. The procedure is to minimize the free energy F = hHi \u2212 T S under\nthe constraint of zero magnetization, hS \u2212a\u2020i ai i = 0, with\nrespect to variational parameters which enter F . These\nare the boson dispersion \u01ebk , the angle \u03c6 and the Bogoliubov angle \u03b8k . The latter enters in a Bogoliubov transformation that mixes the operators of the two interpenetrating N\u00e9el sublattices and renders the nonzero temperature density matrix diagonal30 . The equal time correlators hSi *Sj i can be written in terms of expectation values\nlike ha\u2020i aj i. Therefore, we define ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bond correlations fij = ha\u2020i aj i = hai a\u2020j i\nand gij = hai aj i = ha\u2020i a\u2020j i. The explicit expressions for\nthe bond correlations are given by\n1 X\n1\ncosh 2\u03b8k (nk + ) exp(\u2212ik * rij )\nN\n2\nk\n1\n1 X\nsinh 2\u03b8k (nk + ) exp(\u2212ik * rij ),\ngij =\nN\n2\nfij =\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nk\n\nwhere nk = [exp(\u03b5k /T ) \u2212 1]\u22121 is the Bose occupation\nfactor.\nIn terms of fij and gij the equal time spin correlator\nhSi * Sj i can be expressed as\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1\n\u03c6ij\nS + \u2212 f (0) + fij\nhSi * Sj i = cos\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1\n\u03c6ij\nS + \u2212 f (0) + gij\n\u2212 sin2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c6ij = \u03c6, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6, \u03c0, for horizontal, vertical and\ndiagonal bonds respectively (see Fig. 1). Using the expression for hSi * Sj i for different bonds, the total energy\ncan be written as\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nJ1 N X\n1\n1\nJ1 N X\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nS + \u2212 f (0) + fx \u2212 sin2\nS + \u2212 f (0) + gx\n+\ncos2\nsin2 \u00d7\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b4 1 =\u00b1x\u0302\n\u03b4 2 =\u00b1\u0177\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\n1\nJ2 N X\n\u03c6\n1\n1\nS + \u2212 f (0) + gy\n\u2212\nS + \u2212 f (0) + fy \u2212 cos2\nS + \u2212 f (0) + gx+y\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nE=\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b4 3 =\u00b1x\u0302\u00b1\u0177\n\nNotice that the expression for total energy only contains\nthe nearest and next-nearest neighbor bond correlation\nparameters fx , fy , gx , gy and gx+y . The constraint of\nzero magnetization, appropriate for T > TN (for the two\ndimensional problem TN = 0), is enforced by the La-\n\ngrange multiplier \u03bc. Minimizing E \u2212 T S \u2212 \u03bcf (0) with\nrespect p\nto \u03b5k , \u03c6, \u03b8k , we obtain tanh 2\u03b8k = \u0001Ak /Bk ,\nBk2 \u2212 A2k and sin \u03c6 fy2 + gy2 \u2212 fx2 \u2212 gx2 = 0,\n\u03b5k =\n\n\f3\nwhere\n\nand we have introduced the form factors Cx,k = cos kx a,\nCy,k = cos ky a, and Cx+y,k = cos kx a cos ky a. Now using\ntanh 2\u03b8k = Ak /Bk in Eq. 3, we obtain the following set\nof self-consistent equations\n\u0012\n1 X Bk\nnk +\nf\u03b1 =\nN\n\u01ebk\nk\n\u0012\n1 X Ak\ng\u03b1 =\nnk +\nN\n\u01ebk\nk\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nC\u03b1,k , \u03b1 = x, y\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nC\u03b1,k , \u03b1 = x, y, x + y (9)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 X Bk\n1\nnk +\nS + = f (0) =\n2\nN\n\u01ebk\n2\n\n(8)\n\n(10)\n\nk\n\nWe identify two important temperature scales T0 and\nT\u03c30 such that T0 > T\u03c30 , by solving the self-consistent\nequations. The temperature T0 = J2 (S + 1/2)[log(1/S +\n1)]\u22121 marks the onset of the largest bond correlation\ngx+y , while T\u03c30 marks the onset of nearest-neighbor bond\ncorrelations. For T > T0 , all the bond correlations vanish\nand we have decoupled local moment behavior. The firstorder transition from the correlated to decoupled moment\nstate at T0 is an artifact of the mean-field theory30 . In the\ntemperature range T\u03c30 < T < T0 , the sublattice angle\n\u03c6 remains arbitrary, and the system has C4v rotational\nsymmetry. For T < T\u03c30 there are two degenerate solutions \u03c6 = \u03c0, with gy = fx = 0, gx 6= 0, fy 6= 0, gx 6= fy ,\nand \u03c6 = 0, with x \u2194 y switching. An Ising order parameter, which is defined\n\u03c6,\n\u0010 classically as \u03c3 = \u03a91 * \u03a92 = cos \u0011\nis modified to \u03c3 \u221d 2 cos2 \u03c62 (fx2 + gy2 ) \u2212 sin2 \u03c62 (fy2 + gx2 ) ,\nand becomes nonzero below T\u03c30 . We identify this temperature as the mean-field \"Ising transition\" temperature; fluctuations will reduce the actual transition to\nT\u03c3 < T\u03c30 .

Therefore\nthe spin-spin correlation length at low temperatures will\nbe dominated by the smallest gap \u22061 = T exp[\u2212\u2206J /T ],\nwhere \u2206J = 2\u03c0\u03c1 is the Josephson energy, with \u03c1 = m0 v1y\nbeing the stiffness and m0 the staggered magnetization\nat T = 0. The velocity anisotropy yields two correlation\nlengths, \u03bex = v1x /\u22061 and \u03bey = v1y /\u22061 .\n\n\f4\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c10 = \u03c1x0 \u03c1y0 is the bare, geometric mean stiffness\nconstant. For parameter values S = 1, and J1 /J2 =\n0.8, we find \u2206J0 = 11.5J2 . After solving the mean field\nequations, we obtain the Josephson energy scale\n\u0014\n\u03c0mv1y\n= \u03c0m (4J2 gx+y + 2J1 gx )(4J2 gx+y\n\u2206J =\na\n\u0015 12\n\u22122J1 fy ) + 2J1 fy \u03bc ,(20)\nwhere m is the staggered magnetization at zero temperature and captures the 1/S corrections to \u2206J . For S = 1,\nJ1 /J2 = 0.8, we have found the zero temperature parameters m = 0.83, gx = 0.96, fy = 0.91, gx+y = 1.07, and\n\u2206J = 10.54J2 . Note that, at T = 0, our calculation is\nconsistent with that of Ref.11 . More details regarding the\nrenormalized \u03c1 and \u2206J obtained from a sigma model calculation will be discussed in Sec. V. Above T\u03c30 , the nearest neighbor bond correlations\nvanish, and two gaps bep\ncome equal, \u22061 = \u22062 = \u2212\u03bc(8J2 gx+y \u2212 \u03bc). As the C4v\nsymmetry is restored above T\u03c30 , the velocity anisotropy\ndisappears and v1x = v1y = v2x = v2y = 4J2 gx+y a.\nIV.\n\nDYNAMIC STRUCTURE FACTOR\n\nThe dynamic structure factor is calculated in the modified spin wave theory through the average of the longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors. It is expressed as\nS(q, \u03c9) =\n\n1 X X\n[cosh(2\u03b8k+q \u2212 2\u03b8k ) \u2212 ss\u0304]\nN\ns,s\u0304=\u00b11\nk\n\n\u00d7\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 s\u01ebk+q \u2212 s\u0304\u01ebk )nsk+q ns\u0304k\n\n(21)\n\n\u2212\nwhere n+\nk = nk + 1 and nk = nk .\nConsider first \u03c9 \u226a T , and low temperatures T \u226a\n\u2206J . The dominant contribution to S(q, \u03c9) comes from\nthe vicinity of the (\u03c0, 0) wave vector. In the limit\n|\u03c0 \u2212 qx | \u226a \u03bb\u22121\n= T /vx and qy \u226a \u03bb\u22121\n= T /vy , we\nx\ny\n\nT/J2=0.5\nT/J2=1.0\nT/J2=1.5\nT/J2=2.0\n\n\u03c9/J2=0.3\n100\n\nS(qx,0,\u03c9)\n\nThe low energy excitations around (\u03c0, 0) can also be\ndescribed in terms of an anisotropic O(3) nonlinear sigma\nmodel. Ignoring the 1/S corrections and weak temperature dependence of the bond parameters, we can take\ngx = fy = gx+y = S, and obtain bare parameters of the\n2\n2\nsigma model \u03c7\u22121\n\u22a50 = 4(2J2 + J1 )a , \u03c1x0 = (2J2 + J1 )S ,\nand \u03c1y0 = (2J2 \u2212 J1 )S 2 . The spatial anisotropy is\ncaptured by two direction dependent spin stiffness constants \u03c1x0 and \u03c1y0 , and \u03c7\u22a50 is the bare uniform transverse susceptibility. The spin wave\np velocities before 1/S\ncorrections\nare\ngiven\nby\nv\n=\n\u03c1x0 /\u03c7\u22a50 , and v1y =\n1x\np\n\u03c1y0 /\u03c7\u22a50 .

The second limit corresponds to momentum scales between inverse correlation length and inverse\nthermal length, where the system appears to have long\nrange order (Goldstone mode behavior). The results for\nS0 are in agreement with one loop scaling results of a\nquantum nonlinear sigma model35,36 .\nA number of features follow from Eqs. (22,23).

As a function of\nq for a fixed \u03c9, S(q, \u03c9) sharpens as temperature is reduced reflecting the increase of correlation length; this\nis also seen from the results of direct numerical calculations (Fig. 3). In the numerical calculations of S(q, \u03c9) in\nEq.

Figs. 4(a) and\n4(b) illustrate the behavior at low energies. Provided\nT < T\u03c30 , the anisotropy of the correlation lengths gives\nrise to an elliptic feature centered around (\u03c0, 0). The\noverall size of the ellipses is reduced as the temperature\nis decreased, reflecting increasing correlation lengths. On\nthe other hand, the ellipticity has only weak temperature\ndependence; the ratio of two correlation lengths is almost\nunaffected by temperature variations for T \u226a T\u03c30 , due\nto the weak temperature dependence of the velocity ratio\nv1x /v1y .\nWith increasing energy, the evolution of the spectral\nweight distribution is illustrated in Figs. 4(b)-4(d). At\nintermediate energies, when \u03c9 is comparable to the peak\nenergy in the dispersion \u01ebk (see Fig. 2), there are features near ((1 \u00b1 1/2)\u03c0, 0), whose spectral weight is relatively small at the temperature shown in Fig. 4(c) but\nwill increase with lowering temperature. The most visible\nspectral feature, however, is associated with the expanding ellipses surrounding (\u00b1\u03c0, 0) and (0, \u00b1\u03c0), as is clearly\nseen in the high-energy spectrum shown in Fig. 4(d).\n\nV. THE ROLE OF ITINERANT ELECTRONS\nAND GINZBURG-LANDAU CONSIDERATIONS\nA.\n\nAnti-ferromagnetic fluctuations\n\nThe description of the iron pnictides in terms of bad\nmetals invokes quasi-localized moments coupled to itinerant electrons whose spectral weight depends on the\nproximity of the system to the Mott transition9 . For\nthe parent compounds, the low-energy spin dynamics can\nbe described in terms of a Ginzburg-Landau functional9\nS = S2 + S4 + . . ., where\nZ\n2\nS2 =\ndqd\u03c9[(r + wAQ + cq2 + \u03c9 2 + \u03b3|\u03c9|)(m2 + m\u2032 )\n+v(qx2 \u2212 qy2 )m * m\u2032 ],\n\n(24)\n\nwhere m and m\u2032 are O(3) vectors respectively for the\nmagnetizations of the two decoupled sublattices, qx and\nqy are measured with respect to (\u00b1\u03c0, 0) or (0, \u00b1\u03c0), w < 1\nis the coherent fraction of the single-electron spectral\nweight, and \u03b3 is the strength of spin damping caused\nby the coupling to the itinerant electrons. S4 contains\n4\n2\nnot only terms of the form m4 , m\u2032 and m2 m\u2032 , but\n\u2032 2\nalso an order-from-disorder term (m * m ) with a negative coefficient28 . Eq. (24) implies that elliptic features\nwill occur in the dynamical responses even in the regime\nwhere the Ising order is not static but fluctuating and\nshort-ranged; the primary role of the itinerant electrons,\nbeyond shifting r through the positive wAQ term, is to\nprovide damping effects to such features.\nWell below the mean-field Ising transition temperature, the thermal fluctuations\nof the Ising order param\u2032\n\u2032\neter \u03c3 = \u00b1hm * m i/|m||m | in the effective action of\nEq. (24)can be ignored. The choice of \u03c3 = \u00b1 respectively correspond to short range (\u03c0, 0) or (0, \u03c0) order.\n\u2032\nFor short range (\u03c0, 0) order, m \u2212 m becomes gapped\nand we find that order parameter dynamics can be approximately determined in terms of a single O(3) order\n\u2032\nparameter field M = m + m . The effective action for\nthis field at quadratic order is given by\nZ\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nS2 \u2248 T dq\nr + wAQ + qx2 vx2 + qy2 vy2 + \u03c9l2 + \u03b3|\u03c9l |\nl\n\n2\nwhere vx/y\n= (c \u00b1 v/4), and \u03c9l = 2\u03c0T l is the Matsubara\nfrequency. With further assumption of small amplitude\nfluctuations, we can write M = M0 n, where M0 is the\nconstant amplitude, and n is the unit vector field. Thus\nlow energy dynamics is now determined by a damped,\nanisotropic nonlinear sigma model. We consider the following damped nonlinear sigma model action\nZ\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nT\nd2 q\nSef f =\nv 2 q 2 + \u03c9l2 + \u03b3|\u03c9l | |n(q, \u03c9l )|2\n2vg\nl\n(26)\n\n\u00d7M\n(25)2\n\n\f6\nIn\np equation we have rescaled\np writing the above\n\u221a\nvy /vx qx \u2192 qx , and vx /vy qy \u2192 qy , and v = vx vy ,\nto write the action in spatially isotropic form, and g =\nv/\u03c1 = v \u22121 \u03c7\u22121\n\u22a5 is the coupling constant with dimension of\nlength. The scaling behavior of the correlation length in\nthe quantum disorder phase and quantum critical regime\nfor this damped nonlinear sigma model has been analyzed\nin Ref. 44. Here we will only consider the thermally disordered or renormalized classical regime.

Here we consider two extreme limits of\n\u03b3/(2\u03c0T ) \u226a 1 and \u03b3/(2\u03c0T ) \u226b 1.\nIn the limit \u03b3/(2\u03c0T ) \u226a 1, we obtain z = 1 nonlinear\nsigma model result\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206\nv \u039b\u0304\n2\u03c0v\nsinh\n(28)\n= sinh\nexp\n2T\n2T\ngT\nIn the limit of small temperatures, such that v \u039b\u0304 \u226b T ,\nand \u2206 \u226a T , we obtain the result for small \u03b3 limit,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\u03c1\n1\n2\u03c0v 1\n(29)\n= T exp \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2206 = T exp \u2212\nT\ng gc1\nT\nwhere gc1 = 4\u03c0/\u039b\u0304 is the coupling strength for zero temperature z = 1 quantum critical point, and \u03c1 is the\nrenormalized spin stiffness constant. From this expression we find \u03be = v/T exp( 2\u03c0\u03c1\nT ) in the renormalized classical regime described by T \u226a 2\u03c0\u03c1. For 2\u03c0\u03c1 \u226b T ,\none obtains z = 1 quantum critical behavior \u03be \u223c v/T .\nIf we go beyond the N \u2192 \u221e limit, or perform a two\nloop renormalization group calculation in the renormalized classical regime, we will find the correct classical\n34,35\nresult \u03be \u223c exp( 2\u03c0\u03c1\n.\nT )\nFor \u03b3/(2\u03c0T ) \u226b 1, the physical properties are governed by a z = 2 nonlinear sigma model.

Notice that correct renormalized classical behavior of the correlation\nlength for large Landau damping is found from the saddle point equation. For\n\u221a 2\u03c0\u03c1 \u226a T we find z = 2 quantum\ncritical behavior \u2206 \u223c 2\u03c0\u03b3T , augmented by logarithmic\ncorrections. From the expressions of gc1 , gc2 we find that\nthe stiffness for the z = 2 case is smaller than the z = 1\ncase. This reflects the role of Landau damping.\nTo summarize, in the limits of both small and large\nLandau damping, the correlation length has an exponential temperature dependence in the renormalized classical\nregime. This will be the basis of our fitting the correlation length, which is described in Appendix A.\nIf we consider the effects of the inter-layer antiferromagnetic exchange coupling Jz in addition to the J1 \u2212 J2\nmodel by using modified spin wave theory (see Appendix\nC), we obtain a finite mean field anti-ferromagnetic transition temperature TN 0 . Within the Ginzburg-Landau\nframework this corresponds to setting r(T ) = 0. The\nfermion contribution wAQ being positive, will decrease\nthe transition temperature from the mean field value TN 0\nto a smaller value TN . However there will be significant\namount of three dimensional antiferromagnetic fluctuations up to the mean field Neel temperature TN 0 . Above\nTN 0 the magnetic fluctuations are essentially two dimensional.\n\nB.\n\nIsing fluctuations\n\nSince the Ising order parameter breaks C4v symmetry, and in particular corresponds to B1g representation of the tetragonal lattice, it will couple to all the\nsinglet fermion bilinears, which correspond to B1g representation. Without the loss of generality if we consider a two orbital model of fermions including only\ndxz and dyz orbitals, the Ising order parameter \u03c3 will\ncouple to (cos kx \u2212 cos ky )\u03a8\u2020ks \u03a8ks , \u03a8\u2020ks \u03c43 \u03a8ks , (cos kx +\ncos ky )\u03a8\u2020ks \u03c43 \u03a8ks , and cos kx cos ky \u03a8\u2020ks \u03c43 \u03a8ks etc., where\n\u03a8\u2020ks = (c\u2020xz,ks , c\u2020yz,ks ) describes the orbital and spin dependent fermion creation operators, and the Pauli matrix\n\u03c43 acts on the orbital basis. Among the various B1g bilinears, the conventional nematic order parameter and the\nferro-orbital order parameter respectively correspond to\n(cos kx \u2212 cos ky )\u03a8\u2020ks \u03a8ks and \u03a8\u2020ks \u03c43 \u03a8ks . Notice that we\ncan couple other d orbitals, following the same symmetry based criterion. When we integrate out the itinerant\nfermions, the contributions to the Ising order parameter\n\u03c3 will arise from generalized B1g particle-hole susceptibilities, and the quadratic part of the low energy action\n\n\f7\n\n(32)\n\n12 meV\n\n20\n\n0.6\n\n15\n\n10\n0.4\n\n5\n\n25\n\n0.8\n\n[0, k, 0] in (r. l. u.)\n\nl\n\n25\n\n0.8\n\n[0, k, 0] in (r. l. u.)\n\nfor \u03c3 will have the form\n\u0015\nZ\nX\u0014\n|\u03c9l |\n2\nS2 [\u03c3] = dq\n|\u03c3(q, \u03c9l )|2\nr\u03c3 + wA0 + q + \u03b3\u03c3\nq\n\n12 r 5 meV\n(L=1)\n\n0.6\n\n15\n10\n\n0.4\n\n5\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nVI.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR IRON PNICTIDES\n\nOur detailed theoretical studies provide the basis to\nunderstand the anisotropic spin responses that have\nbeen observed in the paramagnetic phase of the parent iron pnictides CaFe2 As2 27 . These observations,\nmade at temperatures above the first order antiferromagnetic/structural transition, can be understood if the\ntransition temperature is assumed to be considerably\nlower than the mean-field Ising transition temperature\nby the effects of fluctuations and coupling to phonons.\nTo compare our theoretical results with the experiments\nof Ref. 27 we have fitted the low frequency experimental data with the dynamic structure factor calculated\nwithin the saddle point approximation of an anisotropic,\ndamped nonlinear sigma model, which follows from the\naction of Eq. (24).

This fermionic contribution will suppress\nthe Ising transition temperature from its mean field value\nT\u03c30 to T\u03c3 . But, the correlation length of the Ising order\nparameter will remain appreciable up to the mean field\ntemperature T\u03c30 . Since Ising transition occurs due to in\nplane magnetic fluctuations, consideration of inter-layer\ncoupling does not significantly modify the Ising correlations.\nWhen we consider the magnetic and Ising order parameter fluctuations on the same footing, further changes in\nthe transition temperatures\nwill arise from the self inter\u2032\n\u2032\naction of \u03c3, m, m , and their mutual interaction \u03c3m*m .\nThe interplay of Ising and magnetic order parameters,\nand their self-interactions are crucial to determining if\nthere will be a concomitant first order transition or two\nseparate second order phase transitions. Despite the suppression of actual transition temperatures and the possible complexity regarding the actual nature of the transitions, we still expect that the correlation lengths of the\nmagnetic and the Ising order parameters will remain sizable up to their respective mean-field transition temperatures.\n\n20\n\n2\n\n(d)\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n[h, 0, 0] in (r.l.u.)\n\nFIG. 5: Panels (a) and (b) respectively demonstrate S(q \u2212\nQ, \u03c9 = 12meV ) at T = 180K obtained from our theory and\ndata of Ref. 27. Panels (c) and (d) respectively demonstrate\nS(q \u2212 Q, \u03c9 = 39meV ) at T = 180K obtained from our theory\nand data of Ref. 27. We have used J1 /J2 = 0.5527 , J2 =\n9.8meV and \u03b3 = 47meV . To facilitate the comparison with\nexperimental result, we have plotted here in the Brillouin zone\ncorresponding to the two-Fe unit cell instead of that for the\none-Fe unit cell used in the rest of the paper.\n\nThe comparison of our results with that of Ref. 27\nare shown in Fig. 5. The calculated elliptic features of\nS(q \u2212 Q, \u03c9) (Fig. 5(a)) is compatible with that seen experimentally (Fig. 5(b)) at low frequencies. This continues to be the case at higher frequencies, as shown in\nFig. 5(c) and Fig. 5(d). The experimental results in the\nparamagnetic phase are consistent with our conclusions\nthat as temperature is lowered, the peaks in the momentum space sharpen but the ellipticity is only weakly affected. Our estimated values of exchange constants are\nconsistent with that of Ref. 27. When \u03c9 is smaller than\nthe excitation gap \u2206, the dynamic structure factor is\npeaked at q = Q. For\n\u221a \u03c9 > \u2206, the intensity peak gets\nshifted to |q \u2212 Q| = \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u22062 /v as shown in Fig. 5(c),\nand the \u03c9 2 term in the dynamics is important to capture\nthis feature also observed in the experiment as shown in\nFig. 5(d).\nInter-layer magnetic couplings in the parent iron arsenides vary considerably among the materials, but are\nalways relatively weak. In Ref. 27, the inter-layer coupling Jz in paramagnetic CaFe2 As2 was shown to be\nvery weak, with Jz /J2 = 0.1, being smaller than its\ncounterpart in the magnetically ordered phase at low\ntemperature. Consideration of such a weak inter-layer\ncoupling does not appreciably change the estimated exchange constants and the in-plane spin dynamics. An\nestimation of the spin stiffness constant using a renormalized classical approximation for the correlation length\nshows that both fermion induced moment reduction, and\nLandau damping can sufficiently renormalize the stiffness constant (see Appendix A). In Appendix B we have\n\n\f8\n\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have addressed the spin dynamics in the paramagnetic phase of a two dimensional J1 \u2212 J2 antiferromagnet\non a square lattice at a finite temperature, using modified spin wave theory. Within the modified spin wave\ntheory we have identified a mean field Ising transition\ntemperature T\u03c30 , below which the C4v symmetry of the\nsquare lattice is spontaneously broken. In the Ising ordered phase the system demonstrates short range (\u03c0, 0)\nor (0, \u03c0) antiferromagnetic order. In order to systematically understand the finite temperature spin-dynamics\nin the paramagnetic phase of iron pnictides, we have described the fermionic contributions and self-interaction\neffects of the order parameter fields within a GinzburgLandau framework. We have found that the fermion contribution and the self-interaction effects can considerably\ndecrease the Neel and the Ising transition temperatures\nfrom their corresponding mean field values. However the\ncorrelation lengths of the magnetic and Ising order parameters can remain appreciable up to the mean field\ntransition temperatures. Based on this assumption, we\nhave fitted the experimental data of Ref. 27, using our\ntheoretical results. The calculated anisotropic features\nof the spin response are compatible with experiments for\ndifferent frequencies.\nFinally, our calculations of the spin fluctuations at\nhigh energies should help understand future experiments.\nHigh-energy spin spectrum at the low-temperature ordered state of CaFe2 As2 23 has already provided valuable\ninformation on the x-y anisotropy of the exchange interactions. Similar experiments have recently been reported in BaFe2 As2 40 and SrFe2 As2 41 , including at temperatures just above the N\u00e9el transition where strong or-\n\n10\nOur fit\nRef. 27\n\u03be ~ exp(2\u03c0\u03c1/T)\n2\u03c0\u03c1=343K\n2\u03c0\u03c1=222K\n\n8\n\n\u03be (\u00c5)\n\nconsidered the effects of the weak inter-layer exchange\ncoupling Jz using the modified spin wave theory. For\nJz /J2 = 0.1 the mean field Neel temperature TN 0 and the\nmean field Ising transition temperature T\u03c30 become very\nclose. However as we have discussed in Sec. V, despite\nthe suppression of the actual transition temperature due\nto various fluctuation mechanisms, the magnetic and the\nIsing correlation lengths remain sizable up to the meanfield transition temperatures. In the temperature regime\nTN < T < TN 0 , there are three-dimensional antiferromagnetic fluctuations. However if we consider the ratio\nof the in-plane and inter-plane correlation lengths (measured in units of corresponding lattice spacing), we find\n\u03bez /\u03bex \u2248 (Jz /(2J2 + J1 ))1/2 . This ratio is of course material dependent. For weak inter-layer coupling of Ref. 27,\nthis ratio is \u223c 0.2, and magnetic fluctuations are indeed\nquasi-two dimensional.\nFinally our discussion regarding the effect of itinerant\nelectrons is most pertinent to the parent systems, but\nis consistent with the experimental observation of similar low-energy anisotropic responses in the carrier-doped\niron pnictides37\u201339 .\n\n6\n\n4\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT (K)\nFIG. 6: (Color\np online) Comparison between the correlation\n\u03bex \u03bey extracted from our fitting and that of\nlengths \u03be =\nRef. 27.

Keck Foundation\nfor support.\n\nAppendix A: Procedure of comparing with the\nexperimental data\n\nWe analyze the experimental data of Ref. 27 by using the imaginary part of the staggered susceptibility\n\u03c7(q \u2212 Q, \u03c9), which is calculated within the saddle point\napproximation for Eq. 26. From the saddle point calculation we find\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c7 (q \u2212 Q, \u03c9) =\n\n\u03b3 2\u03c92\n\n+\n\n(\u03c9 2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c7\u22121\n\u22a5 \u03b3\u03c9\n2\nvx (qx \u2212 \u03c0)2\n\n\u2212 vy2 qy2 \u2212 \u22062 )2\n(A1)\n\nAt q = Q, we have\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c7 (0, \u03c9) =\n\n\u03c7\u22121\n\u22a5 \u03b3\u03c9\n\u03b3 2 \u03c9 2 + (\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u22062 )2\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere \u03c7\u22a5 is the uniform transverse susceptibility. We calculate the velocities vx and vy using Eq. 13 and Eq. 14,\nand for the exchange constants we choose J2 = 10meV\n\n\f9\nand J1 = 0.55J2 = 5.5meV , as determined by Diallo\net al.27 . By fitting the experimental data we determine\nthe temperature independent Landau damping strength\n\u03b3 and the \u2032\u2032temperature dependent gap \u2206. By fitting the\ndata for \u03c7 (0, \u03c9) at T = 180K, with the formula from\nEq. A2, we find the Landau damping strength \u03b3 and\nthe gap \u2206 at 180K. At low frequencies, Eq. (A2) can\nbe furtherpapproximated by a Lorentzian with a width\n\u0393T \u2248 \u22062 / \u03b3 2 \u2212 2\u22062 . At the relatively low temperature\nof 180K, the Lorentzian form is a good fit to Eq. (A2) up\nto frequencies of about 40 meV, and \u0393T = 7meV . At the\nhigh temperature of 300K, the Lorentzian form, which\nbecomes a poorer fit to Eq. (A2) over the same frequency\nrange, yields \u0393T = 44meV . The definition of the energy\nline-width as \u0393T is the same notation as used in Ref. 27,\nbut the constant \u03b3 used in Ref. 27 is not the conventional\nLandau damping strength and has a different meaning\nfrom ours. Our estimation is \u03b3 = 47meV . For the available data at nonzero q \u2212 Q at different temperatures, we\nuse the value of \u03b3 so determined, and find the \u2206 at different temperatures. Using the values of vx , vy and \u2206,\nwe find the correlation length \u03bex and \u03bey . The comparison\nof our theoretically calculated dynamic structure factor\nwith the fitted parameter values, and the experimental\nresults at low frequency 12meV are shown in Fig. 5(a)\nand Fig. 5(b) of the main text. Even at higher energy\n\u03c9 = 39meV our results for the dynamic structure factor\nare in reasonable agreement with experimental data, and\nthe comparison for this frequency is shown in Fig. 5(c)\nand Fig. 5(d) of the main text. The consideration of the\n\u03c9 2 term in the effective action, leads to an interesting\nfeature of the dynamic structure\nfactor. For low frequen\u2032\u2032\ncies such that \u03c9 < \u2206, \u03c7 (q \u2212 Q, \u03c9 is peaked at q = Q.\nBut at higher frequencies such that \u03c9 > \u2206, the intensity\npeak occurs away from the antiferromagnetic\u221awave-vector\nand its location is determined by |q \u2212 Q| = \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u22062 /v.\nThis shift in the intensity peak can clearly seen by comparing Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(c). Similar shift in the intensity peak can also be seen in the experimental results by\ncomparing Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 5(d). For the correlation\nlength we have compared our and experimental results\nin Fig. 6 by plotting the temperature dependence of the\ngeometric mean of \u03bex and \u03bey . By fitting the correlation\nlength with the renormalized classical formula, we have\nobtained an estimation for the stiffness constant. The\nfermion induced reduction of the magnetic moment M0 ,\nand Landau damping are found to significantly reduce\nthe stiffness constant in comparison to a pure J1 \u2212 J2\nmodel.\n\nAppendix B: Effects of inter-layer exchange coupling\n\nThe quasi-2D nature of the spin dynamics was clearly\nshown in Ref. 27. To explain the observed (\u03c0, 0, \u03c0) antiferromagnetic order, an inter-layer antiferromagnetic\ncoupling Jz was assumed and Jz was estimated to be\n\u223c 0.1J2 . To assess the effects of Jz on the spin dynamics\n\nwe first incorporate the three-dimensional effects in our\nmodified spin wave theory calculations. For simplicity\nwe assume the sublattice angle \u03c6 = \u03c0. The modification\nto our discussion in Sec. I comes through an additional\ninter-layer antiferromagnetic bond correlation parameter\ngz . The Ising transition will be determined by the vanishing of in plane nearest-neighbor bond correlations gx\nand fy . In the presence of Jz , there is a finite, meanfield antiferromagnetic transition temperature TN 0 , corresponding to Bose condensation of a's.

The temperature dependence of the mean-field bond parameters for\nJz /J2 = 0.1 are shown in Fig. 7(b). With increasing Jz ,\nthe Neel temperature gradually increases and asymptotically approaches T\u03c30 . Since the mean-field Ising transition is a consequence of the two-dimensional magnetic\nfluctuations, T\u03c30 is not modified by the finite inter-layer\ncoupling Jz .
