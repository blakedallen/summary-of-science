Ghosh, Titash Rakshit and Supriyo Datta\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0212166v2 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 11 Mar 2004\n\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, W.

The\nelectrostatic component leads to the well-known thermal limit in the absence of tunneling. We show\nthat in a standard three-terminal geometry and in the absence of strong electron-phonon coupling,\nthe conformational component can lead to significant advantages only if the molecular dipole moment \u03bc is comparable to etox , tox being the thickness of the oxide. Surprisingly this conclusion is\nindependent of the \"softness\" of the conformational modes involved, or other geometrical factors.\nDetailed numerical results for specific examples are presented in support of the analytical results.\nPACS numbers: PACS numbers: 85.65.+h, 73.23.-b,31.15.Ar\n\nDevice miniaturization is progressively heading towards solid state electronic components that are molecular in nature [1, 2]. Molecular transistors are of great current interest from both basic and applied points of view.\nDespite theoretical proposals [3, 4, 5] and experimental\nreports [6, 7, 8] of three-terminal molecular devices, their\ngeneral physical principles are not yet well understood.\nIn a standard silicon MOSFET the gate modulates the\ncurrent by controlling the channel charge through its electrostatic potential. Good transistor action requires that\nthis channel potential respond much more to the gate\nthan to the drain, implying an oxide thickness tox that\nis much smaller than the channel length L (Fig. 1a). A\nmolecular transistor operating on electrostatic principles\nought to have the same design limitation, so that even\nnominal gate control in a 10 \u00c5 molecule such as phenyl\ndithiol (PDT) [1] demands an oxide that is prohibitively\nthin [9]. It is therefore natural to investigate alternate\nprinciples of molecular transistor action, such as by utilizing conformational degrees of freedom [4]. For instance,\na gate field coupled with a molecular dipole moment ~\u03bc\ncould cut off the current by tilting it away from a contact\n(Fig. 1b), or by twisting one part relative to the other,\nbreaking its conjugation [10, 11] (Fig. 1c). Such a mechanism could respond more strongly to the gate than the\ndrain if ~\u03bc is engineered to lie along the source-drain field.\nIn this paper, we derive a general expression\nfor the transconductance per unit current gm /I =\n(1/I)(\u2202I/\u2202Vg ) (I: current, Vg : gate voltage) [12] for different transistor mechanisms, both electrostatic and conformational [15]. For a large separation of time scales between electronic and vibronic modes, as is typical in room\ntemperature molecular conductors [16], the electrostatic\nand conformational transconductances are additive, with\na well-known electrostatic maximum:\nes\n[gm\n/I]max = e\u03b2 = (25mV )\u22121 = 40V \u22121\n\n(1)\n\n(\u03b2: inverse thermal energy), achieved only if tox \u226a L and\nif there is negligible tailing in the density of states. In ad-\n\nFIG. 1: In a standard transistor (a) the gate voltage Vg controls the current I by controlling the induced charge. But\nin conformational transistors the gate controls the current\nthrough the configurational parameter \u03b8. This could be either (b) through a variation in coupling with the contact, or\n(c) a variation in transmission through the molecule itself.\n\ndition, we find a fundamental conformational maximum,\nindependent of modal stiffness or molecular geometry:\n\u0002 conf \u0003\n(2)\ngm /I max = e\u03b2(\u03bc/etox ).\n\nThese simple expressions for gate control are later\ncorroborated with detailed numerical results that selfconsistently combine a semi-empirical description of the\ndevice Hamiltonian with a nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) description of transport. Based on these\nresults, it seems that good molecular transistor action in\na standard MOS geometry with a modest gate insulator\nthickness would require degenerately doped semiconducting contacts, along with the incorporation of a molecular\ndipole dipole aligned along the source-drain direction and\nlarge enough to overcome any room-temperature thermal\n\n\f2\naveraging over conformations, ie, larger than etox .\nWe assume above that conducting and non-conducting\nmolecular states lie in the same valley in the conformational potential landscape. The gate voltage shifts the\nminimum within this valley but thermal excitations lead\nto a statistical average over the entire valley, making it\ndifficult to change the current any faster than the fundamental limit implied by Eq. 2. One could get around\nthis limit if the conducting and non-conducting molecular\nstates belong to distinct metastable valleys [4], such that\nthermal averaging takes place only over one valley or the\nother. The role of the gate then is to shift the molecule\nfrom one valley to the other through a large impulsive\nforce. Such a mechanism, however, is very different from\nthe operating principles of present day MOS devices.\nWe will now discuss these issues quantitatively by deriving Eq. 5 for gm /I and evaluating its electrostatic and\nconformational components for specific illustrative examples, with detailed numerical calculations for support.\nTransconductance equation. A source-drain bias Vd\nsplits the contact chemical potentials \u03bc1,2 by the applied\nvoltage. The molecular I-V is obtained from Landauer\ntheory [13], which can be recast in the less familiar form:\nZ\n2e \u03bc2\ndE h T\u0303 (E) i;\nI =\nh \u03bc1\nT\u0303 (E) = T (E) \u2297 FT (E).\n\n(3)\n\nThermal broadening appears [14] as a convolution \u2297\nof the transmission T (E) at zero lead temperature with\nthe thermal broadening function FT (E) = \u2212\u2202f (E)/\u2202E,\nf (E) = 1/[exp(E\u03b2) + 1]. h. . .i gives a thermal average\nover various molecular configurations {x} with probabilities set by the conformational potential energies U ({x}):\n\nhT\u0303 (E)i =\n\nP\n\ni\n\nT\u0303 (E; xi )wi\nP\n,\ni wi\n\nwi = exp [\u2212\u03b2U (xi )],\n\n(4)\n\nxi denoting the coordinate of the ith configuration. From\nEq. 3, I = (2e/h)(\u03bc1 \u2212\u03bc2 )hT\u03030 i, T\u03030 being the average value\nof T\u0303 (E) over the energy range \u03bc1 < E < \u03bc2 . From Eq. 4,\nes\nconf\nstraightforward algebra gives gm = gm\n+ gm\n, where\n*\n+\nes\n\u2202 T\u03030\n1\ngm\n,\n(5a)\n=\nI\nhT\u03030 i \u2202Vg\n\"\n\u001d \u001c\n\u001d#\n\u001c\nconf\ngm\n\u2202U\n\u03b2\n\u2202U\n\u2212 T\u03030\n. (5b)\n=\nhT\u03030 i\nI\n\u2202Vg\n\u2202Vg\nhT\u03030 i\nThe transconductance has two additive contributions: an\nelectrostatic term describing how the gate controls the\nchannel charge, and a conformational term describing\nhow the gate controls the transmission by deforming the\nmolecule [16]. We now discuss these terms one by one.\nElectrostatic control. Electrostatically the gate modulates the self-consistent potential, effectively moving the\n\nmolecular energy levels relative to the contacts. A complete treatment of this effect requires a self-consistent\nsolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson equations. However,\none can get a qualitative description by assuming that\na gate bias rigidly shifts the energy levels and hence the\ntransmission: T (E, Vg ) \u2248 T (E \u2212 \u03b3eVg ). The parameter\n\u03b3 tells us the average molecular potential Vm in response\nto a change in gate bias: \u03b3 \u2261 \u2202Vm /\u2202Vg . Using Eq. 5a,\n+\n*\nes\ne\u03b3\n\u2202 T\u03030\ngm\n.\n(6)\n=\nI\nhT\u03030 i \u2202E\n\u03b3 \u223c CG /(CG + CS + CD + CQ ), where CG,S,D represent\nthe effective capacitances coupling the molecule to the\ngate, source and drain respectively, while CQ is the quantum capacitance proportional to the molecular density of\nstates [17]. One could view CG,S,D as a representation\nof Poisson's equation, and CQ as a linearized representation of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. Under OFF conditions\nCQ is negligible and \u03b3 can be made close to one in a welldesigned FET by making tox \u226a L, so that CG \u226b CS,D .\nHowever, as we noted earlier, this becomes increasingly\ndifficult as we try to engineer ultrasmall devices that are\nonly tens of atoms long (L \u223c 1\u22125 nm). The electrostatic\nparameter \u03b3 is then severely reduced, motivating us to\nlook for non-electrostatic mechanisms for control. Note\nthat the electrostatic restriction on \u03b3 is fundamental, and\nmay not be easy to handle without using large dielectric\nconstant insulators with a small effective thickness.\nEq. 6 also elucidates the role of a sharp transition in\nT\u03030 as a function of E in realizing good electrostatic control. A metallic conductor with constant T\u03030 (E) cannot\nbe used to build an electrostatic switch. Semiconductors\nby contrast have a band-edge where T\u03030 (E) drops to zero\nover a very small energy range \u2206E, so that from Eq. 6,\nes\ngm\n/I \u2248 e\u03b3/\u2206E.\n\n(7)\n\nSince T\u03030 (E) represents a convolution of T (E) and FT (E),\nthe minimum value of \u2206E equals that for FT (E), which\nis \u223c 1/\u03b2. This leads to the well-known upper limit of\nes\ne\u03b2 for gm\n/I, corresponding to \u03b3 = 1 and \u2206E = 1/\u03b2.\nAn important point to note is that increased tunneling\nin nanodevices can make T (E) non-zero below bandgap,\nwith \u2206E \u226b 1/\u03b2. This condition is made worse by the\nuse of metallic (rather than semiconducting) source and\ndrain regions which is common for molecular devices [1,\n2]. In view of recent progress in growing molecules on\nsilicon surfaces [18], using doped semiconducting contacts\nseems a realizable and highly desirable ideal.\nConformational control. The conformational mechanism (Eq. 5b) operates by changing the relative energies U for different molecular configurations {xi }. As expected, we get zero transconductance if T\u03030 is independent\nof the configuration {xi }, or its variation is uncorrelated\nwith \u2202U/\u2202Vg . But if T\u03030 and \u2202U/\u2202Vg are negatively correlated such that configurations with larger transmission\n\n\f3\nT\u03030 have their energies U reduced by the gate voltage Vg\n(and hence made more likely) then the current increases,\nconf\nconf\nwith a positive gm\n/I. To estimate gm\n/I, we write:\nU (\u03b8; Vd ; Vg ) = U0 (\u03b8) \u2212 (\u03bcVg /tox ) sin \u03b8 \u2212 (\u03bcVd /L) cos \u03b8,\n(8)\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the molecular dipole ~\u03bc and\nthe source-drain field Vd /L. Aligning the dipole along\nthe latter eliminates its torque [19], giving the gate field\nVg /tox an obvious superiority. Using Eq. 8 in Eq. 5b,\n\"\n#\nconf\n\u03bc hT\u03030 ihsin \u03b8i \u2212 hT\u03030 sin \u03b8i\ngm\n= \u2212\u03b2\n.\n(9)\nI\ntox\nhT\u03030 i\nThe quantity within parantheses has a maximum value\nof one, indicating that the maximum conformational\ntransconductance is given by \u03bc\u03b2/tox as stated earlier (see\nEq. 2). If \u03bc is comparable to etox , then it is indeed possible for this mechanism to provide respectable levels of\ncontrol. For a 10 \u00c5 oxide, \u03bc/etox \u223c 0.15 for an aromatic molecule with one redox NO2 sidegroup per benzene ring. Although it is hard to squeeze in any more\ndipolar subgroups per ring, one could incorporate large\neffective dipoles external to the molecule, using a strong\npiezoelectric gate-molecular coupling, for instance [7]. In\nany case, a conformational transconductance that is, say,\na tenth of e\u03b2 may still be useful in view of the difficulties\nwith the electrostatic mechanism discussed earlier.\nSignificantly, the upper limit on the conformational\ntransconductance (Eq. 2) is unaffected by the 'softness' of\nthe modes described by U0 (\u03b8) in Eq. 8. For the bending\nand twisting configurations in Figs.1(b,c), we write:\nU0 (\u03b8) = U0bend (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )2 /2,\nU0 (\u03b8) = U0twist (1 \u2212 cos 2\u03b8) /2.\n\n(10)\n\nTwisting a molecular bond is much easier than bending\nit (U0bend \u223c 2 eV [20], U0twist \u223c 0.03 eV [21]); however,\ntwisting also makes thermal averaging more significant,\nso that no advantage is gained as far as gm is concerned.\nThe quantity inside parentheses in Eq. 9 can ideally\nhave a maximum value of one if T\u03030 is very sharply varying. In practice it is smaller, depending on the variation\nof T\u03030 with \u03b8. As an example, we model a self-assembled\nPDT monolayer (Fig. 1b) chemisorbed on a Au(111) substrate, varying the tilt angle from default (\u03b80 \u223c 200 )\nto upright position and increasing the sulphur-gold coupling exponentially. Although accidental symmetries at\nspecific angles of the highly directional orbital wavefunctions quench the overlap [11, 22], such orientational effects wash out on averaging over various possible positions of the sulphur and gold surface atoms in the upright\nconfiguration. The dominant angular dependence in T0\nthen arises from the overlap between sulphur and gold radial wavefunctions: T0 (\u03b8) \u221d exp [\u22122ZL(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)/na0 ],\n(Z = 3: screened nuclear charge, n: principal quantum\n\nnumber of sulphur, a0 = 0.529\u00c5). This gives a correlation in Eq. 9 of \u223c 0.1 at room temperature (\u03bc \u2248 8\nDebye,Vg /tox = 1V /nm). This variation can be made\nto approach a delta-function by increasing L, giving a\nstronger correlation. Similarly for the rotational configuration in Fig. 1c we find T0 (\u03b8) \u221d cos4 \u03b8 [23], leading to a\nconfigurational average \u223c 0.3. The correlation depends\non the variation T0 (\u03b8), but also on the weighting factors\nwhich in turn depend on the bond stiffness, temperature,\ngate field and dipole moment.\n\nFIG. 2: The I-V for PDT at a given angle saturates on crossing the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, increasing with decreasing tilt angle. The electrostatic gate influence (inset) causes a shift in the conductance peak towards\nlower voltages for p-type (HOMO) conduction.\n\nNumerical Results. We now present detailed calculations of the I-V for the structures in Figs. 1b,1c. The\ntransmission at a given angle is calculated using the\nnonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism [24]\nwith an extended H\u00fcckel Hamiltonian H. We solve\n\u22121\n\nG(E) = (ES \u2212 H \u2212 U (\u03c1) \u2212 \u03a31 \u2212 \u03a32 ) ,\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\nf1 G\u03931 G\u2020 + f2 G\u03932 G\u2020 dE/2\u03c0,\n\u03c1 =\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0001\n(11)\nT = trace \u03931 G\u03932 G\u2020 ,\n\nself-consistently (S: overlap matrix, f1,2 = f (E \u2212 \u03bc1,2 )).\nAn ideal Au(111) surface geometry [24] is used to calculate the contact self-energies \u03a31,2 and level broadenings\n\u03931,2 . The self-consistent potential U (\u03c1) is obtained by\nsolving Laplace's equation for the device geometry with\na 10 \u00c5 oxide and a Hubbard-type electron-electron term.\nFig. 2 shows the zero-temperature I-V for a PDT relay\nfor various tilt angles. The current tends to saturate on\ncrossing the HOMO level, and increases with decreasing\ntilt (increasing Vg ). In addition, there is a conventional\nelectrostatic gate influence [9]. For a p-type (HOMO)\nconduction, a negative gate bias raises the molecular lev-\n\n\f4\nels relative to the contacts, producing a lateral shift in the\nconductance (G = \u2202I/\u2202Vd ) towards lower |Vd | (inset).\nFig. 3 shows the three-terminal I-V of the Tour-Reed\nmolecule [25] containing a nitroamine redox group at\n(a) 0 K and (b) 300 K [26]. EF is assumed to lie in\nthe HOMO tail, giving an ohmic I-V at low Vd . The\nimpedance is compromised by the poor electrostatics due\nto the oxide thickness and MIGS, as discussed earlier.\nThe low-temperature gm /I is impressive due to the low\ntorsion constant and the large dipole, a mere 400 mV\ngate bias reducing the current two hundred times. At\nroom temperature, however, the molecule samples a wide\nrange of angles, reducing gm /I substantially. The gatemodulation continues to be observable, but the current is\na lot harder to switch off. A lower torsion constant gives\nbetter gate control, but increases thermal effects as well.\n\nFIG. 3: I-V of the Tour-Reed molecule [25] for various gate\nvoltages at (a) 0 K and (b) 300 K, EF lying in the tail of\nthe HOMO level. At 300 K there is some gate modulation,\nalthough it is hard to completely switch the current off.\n\nThe performance of a transistor also depends on its\noperating speed. While complicated isomeric cis-trans\nrotations tend to be slow, bond rotations are much faster\n(\u223c 10-100 GHz), and need to be damped out without\nconsuming too much power. Image forces and Van der\nWaals interactions with electrodes [27] as well as steric\nand hydrogen bonding interactions between molecules [5]\nin a mixed monolayer could damp out such oscillations.\nWe have shown that conformational transitions can aid\nelectrostatic gate control significantly if we could engineer a large molecular dipole along a suitable direction.\nWays around such design restrictions require going beyond Eq. 8, employing other kinds of electromechanical\ngate-molecular coupling (piezoelectric for example), or\nusing non-traditional, bistable potentials with large impulsive gate voltages [4]. Eq. 5 gives us a general way\nto quantitively compare the transconductance of these\nvarious field-effect mechanisms in molecular transistors.\nWe thank P. Damle, D. Monroe, P.
