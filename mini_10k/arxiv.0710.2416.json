In\nthis paper, we propose a model to address both of those problems and show that they can\nbe solved by means of a common origin..\nOne of the most popular models to accommodate the right amount of baryon asymmetry\nin the present Universe is so-called leptogenesis [1], which is realized in the context of seesaw\nmechanism [2], and thus the smallness of neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry can\nbe simultaneously achieved. However, the typical leptogenesis demands rather large scale\nof the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass, which makes it impossible to probe in present\nexperimental laboratories. To lower the scale of leptogenesis, we have recently proposed a\nvariant of seesaw mechanism [3] and showed that the required leptogenesis is allowed at a\nlow scale even a few TeV scale without imposing the tiny mass splitting between two heavy\nMajorana neutrinos required in the resonant leptogenesis [4]. The main point of our model\npreviously proposed is to introduce an equal number of gauge singlet neutrinos in addition\nto the heavy right-handed singlet neutrinos. In our scenario, there exist new Yukawa interactions mediated by singlet Higgs sector which is coupled with the extra singlet neutrinos\nand the right-handed singlet neutrinos. As shown in [3], the new Yukawa interactions may\nplay a crucial role in enhancing the lepton asymmetry, so that low scale leptogenesis can be\nachieved.\nOn the other hand, it is worthwhile to examine if those new particles, either the newly\nintroduced singlet neutrinos or singlet scalar bosons, can be a dark matter candidate because any kind of neutral, stable and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can be\nregarded as a good candidate for dark matter. While light singlet neutrinos with mass of\norder MeV or keV have been considered as a warm dark matter candidate [5], heavy singlet\nneutrinos with mass of order 100 GeV as a dark matter candidate have not been studied\nmuch in detail. While the cold dark matter (CDM) models supplemented by a cosmological\nconstant are in a good agrement with the observed structure of the Universe on large scales,\nthe cosmic microwave background anisotropies and type Ia supernovae observations for a\ngiven set of density parameters, there exists a growing wealth of observational data which\nare in conflict with the CDM scenarios [6]. To remedy the difficulties of the CDM models\n2\n\n\fon galactic scales, a self-interacting dark matter candidate has been proposed [7, 8, 9], and\nit has been discussed that a gauge singlet scalar coupled to the Higgs boson, leading to an\ninvisible decaying Higgs, is a good candidate for the self-interacting dark matter [10, 11, 12].\nIn this paper, we will show that either the new gauge singlet neutrinos or singlet scalar\nbosons, which play an important role in enhancing the lepton asymmetry so that the low\nscale leptogenesis is realized, can be a good candidate for dark matter. For our purpose,\nwe will first present how the enhancement of the lepton asymmetry through the mediation\nof the newly introduced particles in our framework can be achieved and then will show\nthat the new gauge singlet particles with the parameter space in consistent with low scale\nleptogenesis can be satisfied with the criteria on the candidate for dark matter. We will\ninvestigate possibilities of dark matter detection through the scattering off the nucleus of\nthe detecting material. In addition, we will study how we can probe our scenarios at high\nenergy colliders and present that the search for the invisible Higgs decay may serve as a\nprobe of dark matter properties.\n\nII.\n\nEXTENDED SEESAW MODEL AND LOW SCALE LEPTOGENESIS\n\nWe begin by explaining what the extended seesaw model is and examine how low scale\nleptogenesis can be realized in this context. The Lagrangian we propose is given in the\ncharged lepton basis as\nLf = Y\u03bdij \u03bd\u0304i HNj + MRij Ni Ni + YSij N\u0304i \u03a6Sj \u2212 mSij Si Sj + h.c.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bdi , Ni , Si stand for SU(2)L doublet, right-handed singlet and newly introduced singlet\nneutrinos, respectively. Y\u03bdij , YSij , MRij represent Dirac Yukawa coupling matrix, Singlet\nYukawa coupling matrix and Heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix, respectively. And H\nand \u03a6 denote the SU(2)L doublet and singlet Higgs scalars. Here, we impose Z2 symmetry\nunder which Si and \u03a6 are odd and all other particles even, which makes this model different\nfrom the extended double seesaw model proposed in [3] even though the contents of particles\nare the same. The immediate consequence of the exact Z2 symmetry is that the lightest Si\nor \u03a6 can be a candidate for the cold dark matter of the Universe.\nDue to the exact Z2 symmetry, the singlet scalar field \u03a6 can not drive a vacuum expectation value. Thus, in this model, light neutrino masses are generated by typical seesaw\n3\n\n\fmechanism, which makes this model different from the model in [3]. After integrating out the\nright-handed heavy neutrino sector NR in the above Lagrangian, the light neutrino masses\nare given by\nm\u03bd =\n\n(Y\u03bd vEW )2\n,\n4MR\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we omitted the indices of the mass matrix and Dirac Yukawa coupling, and vEW = 246\nGeV is the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Although the absolute values of three neutrino\np\nmasses are unknown, their masses are expected to be of order of \u2206m2atm \u2243 0.05 eV and\np\n\u2206m2atm \u2243 0.01 eV, provided that the mass spectrum of neutrinos is hierarchical. There\n\nis also a bound on neutrino masses coming from WMAP observation, which is m\u03bd . 0.23\neV. Thus it is interesting to see how the neutrino masses of order of 0.01 \u223c 0.1 eV can\n\nbe obtained in our scenario. Such light neutrino masses can be generated through seesaw\nformula Eq. (2), if we take, as an example, Y\u03bd and MR to be of order 10\u22126 and 104 GeV,\nrespectively.\nNow, let us consider how low scale leptogenesis can be achieved by the decay of the lightest\nright-handed Majorana neutrino in our framework. Right handed heavy Majorana neutrinos\nare even under Z2 symmetry, so that they can decay into a pair of the singlet particles, \u03a6\nand S, or the standard model Higgs and the lepton doublet. Since the Yukawa couplings\n(YS )2(3)i are taken to be large, the processes involving N2,3 remain in thermal equilibrium\neven at T \u2243 MR1 , and thus the decays of N2,3 can not lead to the desired baryon asymmetry.\nHowever, the decay processes of the lightest right-handed Majorana neutrino N1 depart from\nthermal equilibrium at T . MR1 , and thus lead to the desired baryon asymmetry\nIt will be shown that there exists a new contribution to the lepton asymmetry which is\nmediated by the extra singlet neutrinos Si and scalar boson \u03a6, and successful leptogenesis\ncan be realized with rather light right-handed Majorana neutrino masses which can escape\nthe gravitino problem encountered in supersymmetric standard model. Without loss of\ngenerality, we can rotate and rephase the fields to make the mass matrices MRij and mSij\nreal and diagonal. In this basis, the elements of Y\u03bd and YS are in general complex. The\nlepton number asymmetry required for baryogenesis is given by\nX \u0014 \u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u0304i H\u0304) \u2212 \u0393(N1 \u2192 li H) \u0015\n\u03b51 = \u2212\n,\n\u0393\n(N\n)\ntot\n1\ni\n\n(3)\n\nwhere N1 is the lightest right-handed neutrino and \u0393tot (N1 ) is the total decay rate.

Assuming that the masses of the Higgs scalars and the newly introduced singlet\nneutrinos are much smaller compared to that of the right-handed neutrino, to leading order,\nwe have\n\u0393tot (Ni ) =\n\n(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 + YS YS\u2020 )ii\nMRi\n4\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nso that\n\u03b51 =\n\n1 X\n([gV (xk ) + gS (xk )]Tk1 + gS (xk )Sk1 ) ,\n8\u03c0 k6=1\n\nwhere Y\u03bd and YS are given in the basis where MR and MS are diagonal, gV (x) =\n\u221a\n(1 + x)ln[(1 + x)/x]}, gS (x) = xk /(1 \u2212 xk ) with xk = MR2 k /MR2 1 for k 6= 1,\nTk1 =\nand\nSk1 =\n\nIm[(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 )2k1 ]\n\n(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 + YS YS\u2020 )11\n\n\u221a\n\nx{1 \u2212\n\n(6)\n\n(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 + YS YS\u2020 )11\n\nIm[(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 )k1 (YS\u2020 YS )1k ]\n\n(5)\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nNotice that the term proportional to Sk1 comes from the interference between the tree-level\ndiagram with the new contribution.\nIn particular, for x \u2243 1, the vertex contribution to \u03b51 is much smaller than the contribution of the self-energy diagrams and the asymmetry \u03b5 is resonantly enhanced, and we do\nnot consider this case. To see how much the new contribution may be important in this\ncase, for simplicity, we consider a particular situation where MR1 \u2243 MR2 < MR3 , so that\n5\n\n\fthe effect of N3 is negligibly small. In this case, the asymmetry can be written as\n\"\n1 MR2 Im[(Y\u03bd\u2217 m\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 )11 ]\n\u03b51 \u2243 \u2212\n16\u03c0 v 2 (Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 + YS YS\u2020 )11\n#\nP\n\u2020\n\u2020\nk6=1 Im[(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd )k1 (YS YS )1k ]\nR,\n+\n(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 + YS YS\u2020 )11\n\n(8)\n\nwhere R is a resonance factor defined by R \u2261 |MR1 |/(|MR2 | \u2212 |MR1 |). For successful leptogenesis, the size of the denominator of \u03b51 should be constrained by the out-of-equilibrium\ncondition, \u0393N1 < H|T =MR1 with the Hubble expansion rate H, from which the correspondp\npP\n\u22124\n2\ning upper bound on the couplings (YS )1i reads\nMR1 /109(GeV).\ni |(YS )1i | < 3 \u00d7 10\np\nThen, the first term of Eq. (8) is bounded as (MR2 /16\u03c0v 2 ) \u2206m2atm R. So if the first term\n\nof Eq. (8) dominates over the second one, R \u223c 106\u22127 is required to achieve TeV scale\n\nleptogenesis, which implies severe fine-tuning. However, since the size of (YS )2i is not constrained by the out-of-equilibrium condition, large value of (YS )2i is allowed for which the\nsecond term of Eq. (8) can dominate over the first one and thus the size of \u03b51 can be enhanced. For example, if we assume that (Y\u03bd )2i is aligned to (YS\u2217 )2i , i.e. (YS )2i = \u03ba(Y\u03bd\u2217 )2i\nwith constant \u03ba, the upper limit of the second term of Eq. (8) is given in terms of \u03ba by\np\n|\u03ba|2 MR2 \u2206m2atm R/16\u03c0v 2, and then we can achieve the successful low scale leptogenesis by\n\ntaking rather large value of \u03ba, instead of imposing very tiny mass splitting between MR1 and\nMR2 . The right amount of the asymmetry, \u03b51 \u223c 10\u22126 , can be obtained for MR1 \u223c 104 GeV,\n\nprovided that \u03ba = (YS )2i /(Y\u03bd )\u22172i \u223c 103 and MR2 2 /MR2 1 \u223c 10. We emphasize that such a\n\nrequirement for the hierarchy between Y\u03bd and YS is much less severe than the required finetuning of the mass splitting between two heavy Majorana neutrinos to achieve the successful\nleptogenesis at low scale.\nSM\nThe generated B-L asymmetry is given by YB\u2212L\n= \u2212\u03b7\u03b51 YNeq1 , where YNeq1 is the number\n\ndensity of the right-handed heavy neutrino at T \u226b MR1 in thermal equilibrium given by\n\nYNeq1 \u2243\n\n45 \u03b6(3) 3\n\u03c0 4 g \u2217 kB 4\n\nwith Boltzmann constant kB and the effective number of degree of freedom g \u2217.\n\nThe efficient factor \u03b7 can be computed through a set of coupled Boltzmann equations which\ntake into account processes that create or washout the asymmetry. To a good approximation\nthe efficiency factor depends on the effective neutrino mass m\u03031 given in the presence of the\nnew Yukawa interactions with the coupling YS by\nm\u03031 =\n\n(Y\u03bd Y\u03bd\u2020 + YS YS\u2020 )11 2\nv .\nMR1\n6\n\n(9)\n\n\fIn our model, the new process of type S\u03a6 \u2192 lH will contribute to wash-out of the produced\nB-L asymmetry. The process occurs mainly through virtual N2,3 exchanges because the\nYukawa couplings (YS )2(3)i are taken to be large in our model and the rate is proportional\nto MR1 |YS Y\u03bd\u2217 /MR2,3 |2 . Effect of the wash-out can be easily estimated from the fact that it\n\nlooks similar to the case of the typical seesaw model if MR1 is replaced with MR1 (YS /Y\u03bd )2 .\nIt turns out that the wash-out factor for (YS )1i \u223c (Y\u03bd )1i , (YS )2i /(Y\u03bd )2i \u223c 103 and MR1 \u223c 104\n\nGeV is similar to the case of the typical seesaw model with MR1 \u223c 104 GeV and m\u03031 \u2243 10\u22123\n\neV, and is estimated so that \u03b51 \u223c 10\u22126 can be enough to explain the baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe provided that the initial lightest right-handed neutrino is thermal [13].\n\nIII.\n\nINVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE DARK MATTER CANDIDATES\n\nNow, let us examine if either the newly introduced singlet Majorana neutrino or the\nsinglet scalar boson can be a candidate for dark matter. For our purpose, in addition to the\nlagrangian Lf given in Eq. (1), we allow quartic scalar interactions for the scalar sectors.\nThen, the lagrangian we consider is given by\nL = Lf +\n\n1\n\u03bbs\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03a6)2 \u2212 m2\u03a60 \u03a62 \u2212 \u03a64 \u2212 \u03bbH \u2020 H\u03a62 .\n2\n2\n4\n\n(10)\n\nNote that the self-interacting coupling of the singlet scalar \u03bbs is largely unconstrained and\nthus can be chosen arbitrarily. But, we assume that it should not be so large that the\nperturbation breaks down. As mentioned before, in order to guarantee the stability of\nthe dark matter candidate, we impose Z2 discrete symmetry under which all the standard\nmodel (SM) particles are even whereas the singlet Majorana neutrinos Si and singlet scalar\nboson \u03a6 are odd. In addition, we demand that the scalar potential is bounded from below\nso as to guarantee the existence of a vacuum and the minimum of the scalar potential\nmust spontaneously break the electroweak gauge group, < H 0 >6= 0, but must not break\nZ2 symmetry imposed above. After breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry, the singlet\nscalar \u03a6- dependent part of the scalar potential is given by\n\u03bbs\n\u03bb\n1\n2\n)\u03a62 + \u03a64 + \u03bbvEW \u03a62 h + \u03a62 h2 ,\n(11)\nV = (m2\u03a60 + \u03bbvEW\n2\n4\n2\n\u221a\nwhere we have adopted 2H \u2020 = (h, 0) and shifted the Higgs boson h by h \u2192 h + vEW , where\nvEW = 246 GeV is the Higgs vacuum expectation value. The physical mass of \u03a6, m\u03a6 , is\n7\n\n\f\"\n\nN\nH\nh\n\nS\n!\nq\n\nS\n\nN\nH\nh\n\n!\n\"\nq\nq\n\nq\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2: Cascade decays of NOP to LOP : (a) case for mS < m\u03a6 , (b) case for m\u03a6 < mS\n2\nthen given by m2\u03a60 + \u03bbvEW\n. We assume that the spectrum of the singlet neutrinos Si is not\n\ndegenerate and two heavier ones S2,3 are so much heavier than S1 that they could not be\ndark matter candidates. Here, we notice that only the lightest odd particle (LOP) under Z2\ncan be a candidate for dark matter in our scenario because the next lightest odd particle\n(NOP) can be decayed into the LOP by the cascade decay, as shown in Fig. 2.\nSince there are two kinds of odd particles under Z2 in our scenario, we can classify two\npossible candidates for dark matter according to which particle is the LOP. One is the case\nthat the singlet Majorana neutrinos S1 is the LOP and the other is that \u03a6 is the LOP. As\nwill be clearer later, the primordial abundance of dark matter candidate is predicted as a\nfunction of masses and coupling \u03bb. Thus, imposing the preferred values of \u03a9DM h2 observed\nfrom WMAP, 0.094 < \u03a9DM h2 < 0.128 [14, 15], we can get a strong relation between mass\nof dark matter candidate and coupling \u03bb.\n\nA.\n\nSinglet Neutrino S as a Dark Matter Candidate\n\nThe singlet neutrino S1 can be a dark matter candidate, provided that mS1 . m\u03a6 . We\nomit the generation index 1 of S1 hereafter. To estimate the relic abundance of the singlet\nneutrino S at a freeze-out temperature xf = mS /Tf , we need to know the annihilation\nprocesses[16]. There are two possible annihilation processes of the singlet neutrino, one is\nhappened at loop level and the other is mediated by \u03a6. But, both possibilities are not\nrelevant to fit the required present relic density of the dark matter because the annihilation\ncross section for the dark matter candidate S is too small, therefore, these processes would\npredict too much relic abundance of S. However, it is well known that if the mass of NOP\nis close to that of LOP, it would not be decoupled from thermal equilibrium at the freeze8\n\n\f+\nh,W ,t,Z,...\n\n\u03c6\n\nh\n+\nh,W ,t,Z,...\n\n\u03c6\n\nFIG. 3: Diagram for annihilation processes of the singlet scalar bosons \u03a6\n\nout temperature of the LOP and thus influences the relic abundance of LOP [17]. We call\nthis coannihilation [17] and this mechanism lowers the present day relic density of S in this\nscenario. It turns out that in our scenario if \u03b4m = m\u03a6 \u2212 mS \u2248 Tf , annihilation processes\nof the NOP into a pair of the SM particles through the s-channel, as shown in Fig. 3, can\nsignificantly affect the relic abundance of S to be appropriately reduced.\nWith the help of the standard formulae for calculating relic abundance of s-wave annihilation [16],\n\u03a9S h2 =\n\n(1.07 \u00d7 109 )xf GeV\u22121\n,\nR\u221e\n1/2\ng\u2217 Mpl xf < \u03c3eff vrel > x\u22122 dx\n\n(12)\n\nwe can estimate the present relic density of singlet Majorana neutrino S. Here g\u2217 is the\ndegrees of freedom in equilibrium at annihilation, and xf = mLOP /Tf is the inverse freezeout temperature in units of mLOP , which can be determined by solving the equation\n\u0001\nxf \u2243 ln 0.038geff (g\u2217 * xf )\u22121/2 MP l mLOP < \u03c3eff vrel > ,\n\nwhere <> means the relevant thermal average, geff =\n\nP\n\ni\n\n(13)\n\ngi (mi /mLOP )3/2 e\u2212(mi \u2212mLOP )/T with\n\nthe number of degree of freedom gi for i = (S, \u03a6), and \u03c3eff is the effective cross section\ndefined in [17]. On calculating \u03a9S h2 , we have used the micrOMEGAs 2.0 program [18].\nThe dominant contribution to \u03c3eff in this case is the pair annihilation cross section of the\nheavier particle \u03a6. Since it is Tf \u223c 0.04 m\u03a6 that the annihilation of \u03a6 is important, what we\nneed to know is the non-relativistic annihilation cross section. In the non-relativistic limit,\ns-channel annihilation of \u03a6 via Higgs exchange is given by [10],\n\u03c3ann vrel =\n\n2\n8\u03bb2 vEW\nFX ,\n(4m2\u03a6 \u2212 m2h )2 + m2h \u03932h\n\n9\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhere \u0393h is the total Higgs decay rate, and FX = limmh\u0303 \u21922m\u03a6\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0393h\u0303X\nmh\u0303\n\n\u0011\n\nwith the partial rate\n\nfor decay h\u0303 \u2192 X, for a virtual Higgs h\u0303. Requiring \u03a9S h2 to be in the region measured from\nWMAP, 0.094 < \u03a9h2 < 0.128 [14, 15], we can obtain a relation between the coupling \u03bb and\nthe mass of the scalar boson m\u03a6 .\nIn the case of \u03a9S h2 = 0.128, in Fig. 4 we represent the relation between \u03bb and mS for\n\u03b4m = 5 GeV. Fig. 4-(a) corresponds to the Higgs mass mh = 120 GeV, whereas Fig. 4-(b)\ncorresponds to mh = 200 GeV. The shadowed region is forbidden due to the breakdown\nof perturbation, so the region 57 (146) GeV \u2264 mS \u2264 74 (190) GeV for mh = 120 (200)\nGeV and \u03a9h2 = 0.128 is not relevant to our scenario.

Here\nthe mass difference \u03b4m = m\u03a6 \u2212 mS has been taken to be 5 GeV and Higgs mass mh to be\n(a) 120 GeV and (b) 200 GeV. Here the shadowed region is forbidden due to the breakdown of\nperturbation.\n\n10\n\n\ffor mh = 120 (200) GeV and \u03a9h2 = 0.128 except the regions corresponding to the poles\nand particle thresholds, the abundance constraint arisen from WMAP results requires \u03bb \u223c\nO(0.5(0.3)\u22121). This result indicates that we do not need any fine tuning or special choice of\nthe parameters in order to achieve right amount of relic abundance of dark matter candidate.\nIt also turns out that if mS is lighter than 50 (74) GeV or heavier than 234 (245) GeV for\nmh = 120 (200) GeV and \u03a9h2 = 0.128, the relic abundance of S is incompatible with\nWMAP results for the relic density. It is worthwhile to notice that the coupling \u03bb gets\nsignificantly suppressed down to the level of 10\u22122 near the Higgs pole. This is because the\nHiggs resonance is quite narrow, which in turn considerably enhances the scalar boson \u03a6\nannihilation rate, especially if 2m\u03a6 is slightly smaller than mh [10, 17]\n\nB.\n\nSinglet Scalar Boson \u03a6 as a Dark Matter Candidate:\n\nThe singlet Higgs scalar \u03a6 can be a candidate for dark matter, provided that m\u03a6 . mS .\nSince \u03a6 is the lightest particle involved in the interaction term YS NS\u03a6, this particle can\nnot decay into other particles, and thus the annihilation processes relevant to a successful\ncandidate for dark matter can occur through the Higgs interaction term \u03bb\u03a62 H \u2020 H. In this\ncase, the singlet scalar bosons annihilate into the SM particles mediated by the Higgs boson\nh.\nIn Ref. [8], it has been proposed that a stable, strongly self-coupled scalar field can solve\nthe problems of cold dark matter models for structure formation in the Universe, concerning\ngalactic scales. Thus, the singlet scalar boson in our model can serve as a self-interacting\nscalar dark matter candidate. If the mass difference between m\u03a6 and mS is substantially\nlarge, the new Yukawa interactions YS NS\u03a6 will negligibly affect the relic density of \u03a6, so\nthe behavior of \u03a6 as a dark matter candidate is the same as that of the self-interacting\nscalar dark matter candidate. If the mass difference between S and \u03a6 is substantially small,\nthe particles Si are thermally accessible and they are as abundant as \u03a6. In this case, the\nformulae for the relic abundance of the particle \u03a6 and its freeze-out temperature xf are given\nby the same forms of Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), respectively. In fact, however, the annihilation\ncross sections associated with the heavier particles Si are turned out to be negligibly small\n2\nin this scenario, so \u03c3eff \u2243 \u03c3\u03a6 g 2/geff\n, where \u03c3\u03a6 is the pair annihilation cross section of \u03a6 and\n\ng is the internal degree of freedom of \u03a6.

Here the shadowed region is forbidden due\nto breakdown of perturbation and the dashed line corresponds to the prediction of the model with\na self-interacting dark matter [10] for \u03a9\u03a6 h2 = 0.128.\n\nfor \u03b4m = mS \u2212 m\u03a6 = 5 GeV and m\u03a6 = 500 GeV in this scenario is about 4% lower than\nthat in the singlet Higgs model without the particles Si , which in turn increases the relic\nabundance of \u03a6.\nSince several important features of our results are quite similar to those of [10], therefore,\nhere we just present what are the differences between [10] and our model. In Fig. 5, we\nshow the relation between \u03bb and m\u03a6 for mh = 120 (200) GeV and \u03b4m = mS \u2212 m\u03a6 = 5 GeV,\nwhich is generated by requiring \u03a9\u03c6 h2 = 0.128 and 0.094. We see from Fig. 5 that m\u03a6 should\n\nbe less than 551 GeV (571 GeV) for mh = 120 (200) GeV and \u03a9h2 = 0.128 in our model, so\nas to be consistent with the relic abundance constraint without breaking down perturbation\n(i.e. \u03bb . 1). This upper limit on m\u03a6 is much more restrictive than what is obtained in [10].\nAlso, we see in Fig. 5-(a) that when m\u03a6 lies between 80 GeV and 551 GeV, the value of \u03bb\nin our model is much larger than that given in [10].\n\n12\n\n\fIV.\n\nIMPLICATION FOR DARK MATTER SEARCH\n\nTo directly detect dark matter, typically proposed method is to detect the scattering of\ndark matter off the nucleus of the detecting material. Since the scattering cross section\nis expected to be very small, the energy deposited by a candidate for dark matter on the\ndetector nucleus is also very small. In order to measure this small recoil energy, typically\nof order keV, of the nucleus, a very low threshold detector condition is required. Since the\nsensitivity of detectors to a dark matter candidate is controlled by their elastic scattering\ncross section with nucleus, it is instructive to examine how large the size of the elastic cross\nsection could be. First, to estimate the elastic cross section with nucleus, we need to know\nthe relevant matrix element for slowly moving spin-J nuclei, which is approximately given\nby [10]\nX\nX\n1\n|An |2\n| < n\u2032 |\nyf f \u0304f |n > |2 \u2243\n,\n2J + 1 spins\n(2\u03c0)6\nf\n\n(15)\n\nwhere n denotes nucleons and |An | is determined to be\nAn = gHnn \u2243\n\n190 MeV\nvEW\n\n(16)\n\nby following the method given in [10] and taking the strange quark mass to be 95 MeV and\n< n|s\u0304s|n >\u223c 0.7.\nNow, let us estimate the sizes of the elastic scattering cross sections in each case of dark\nmatter candidates.\n\n(i)\n\nCase for mS < m\u03c6 :\n\nThe Feynman diagram describing the scattering of the singlet Majorana neutrino S with\nnucleons and nuclei is given by t-channel Higgs and heavy Majorana neutrino exchange,\nas shown in Fig. 6-(a).

Here the dashed line corresponds to the\nprediction of the model with a self-interacting dark matter [10] for \u03a9h2 = 0.128.\n\none can see from Fig. 7, when \u03a9h2 = 0.128, the region m\u03a6 < 42 (56) GeV for mh = 120 (200)\nGeV and \u03b4m = 5 GeV is excluded by XENON10 Dark Matter Experiment [20].\nComparing our results with those in the model of self-interacting scalar dark matter [10],\nwe see that our prediction for the elastic cross section in the region 80 (110) GeV < m\u03a6 <\n551 (571) GeV for mh = 120 (200) GeV, and \u03b4m = 5 GeV is about 1.4 (1.5) to 4.3 (4.4)\ntimes larger than that estimated in [10]. This indicates that our scenario for scalar dark\nmatter is distinguishable from the original model of the self-interacting scalar dark matter.\n\nV.\n\nIMPLICATION FOR HIGGS SEARCHES AT LHC\n\nNow we investigate the implications of our scenarios for Higgs searches at collider\nexperiments. The singlet scalar boson will not directly couple to ordinary matters, but\nonly to the Higgs fields.\n\nAlthough the presence of the singlet scalars will not affect\n\nelectroweak phenomenology in a significant way, it will affect the phenomenology of the\n\n15\n\n\fHiggs boson. Due to the large values for the coupling \u03bb \u223c O(0.1 \u2212 1.0) required by\nrelic abundance constraints, real or virtual Higgs production may be associated with the\nsinglet Higgs \u03a6 production, as discussed in [10]. We see from Eq. (11) that if 2m\u03a6 < mh ,\nthe real Higgs boson can decay into a pair of singlet scalars, whereas if 2m\u03a6 > mh ,\nthe singlet scalar bosons can not be produced by real Higgs decays, but arise only via\nvirtual Higgs exchange. As we know that any produced singlet scalar bosons are not expected to interact inside the collider, thus they only give rise to strong missing energy signals.\n\n(i) Case for 2m\u03a6 < mh :\nIn this case, the Higgs boson can invisibly decay into a pair of the singlet scalar bosons. The\ninvisible decay width is given at tree level by\n\u0393H\u2192\u03c6\u03c6\n\n2\n\u03bb2 vEW\n=\n32\u03c0mh\n\ns\n\n1\u2212\n\n4m2\u03a6\n.\nm2h\n\n(19)\n\nSince the relic abundance constraints require the large value of the coupling \u03bb, the invisible\ndecay width to the Higgs boson gets large. It is known that if the Higgs mass is less than\n2MW so that the Higgs partial width into the SM particles is very small, the Higgs will\ndecay predominantly into the singlet scalar bosons. Then, LHC may yield a discovery signal\nfor an invisible Higgs with enough reachable luminosity, for instance, 10 f b\u22121 of integrated\nluminosity for mh = 120 GeV, in associated production with Z boson [21]. To quantify\nthe signals for the invisible decay of the Higgs boson, we investigate the ratio R defined as\nfollows [10]:\nR=\n\nBrh\u2192b\u0304b, c\u0304c, \u03c4\u0304 \u03c4 (SM + \u03a6)\n\u0393h,total (SM)\n=\n.\nBrh\u2192b\u0304b, c\u0304c, \u03c4\u0304 \u03c4 (SM)\n\u0393h\u2192\u03c6\u03c6 + \u0393h,total (SM)\n\nThe ratio R indicates how the expected signal for the visible decay of the Higgs boson can\ndecrease due to the existence of the singlet scalar bosons.\n(a) Case for singlet neutrino dark matter: In Fig. 8, we plot the value of R as a function\nof m\u03a6 for (a) mh = 120 GeV and (b) mh = 200 GeV, respectively. Here, we fixed the\nvalue of \u03b4m to be 5 GeV, and used the relation between \u03bb and m\u03a6 which is obtained from\nthe relic abundance constraints as explained before. On calculating the decay rate of Higgs\nparticle, we have used CalcHEP 2.4.5 [19]. As can be seen in Fig. 8, the prediction for the\nvalue of R is totally different from that in [10]. But, in this case, we can probe the invisible\nHiggs decay by using R only for the very narrow region 55 (79) GeV < m\u03a6 < 60 (100) GeV\n16\n\n\f#a$\n1.0\n0.8\nSinglet Higgs Model !10\"\n\nR\n\n0.6\n\nmh !120 GeV\n\u2206m!m# $mS !5 GeV\n\n0.4\n\nOur model\n\n0.2\n%!0.128 %!0.094\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nm#\n#b$\n1.0\n0.9\n\nR\n\n0.8\nSinglet Higgs Model!10\"\n\n0.7\n\n%!0.128\n\n0.6\n\n%!0.094\nmh !200 GeV\n\u2206m!m# $mS !5 GeV\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nOur model\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nm#\n\nFIG. 8: Plots of the ratio R as a function of m\u03a6 for our model with \u03a9\u03a6 h2 = 0.128 and 0.094, (solid\nlines) when (a) mh = 120 GeV and (b) 200 GeV, and for the model with a self-interacting dark\nmatter [10] with \u03a9\u03a6 h2 = 0.128 (dashed line). Here the shadowed region represents the forbidden\nregion by Fig. 4, which applies only to our model.\n\nwhen mh = 120 (200) GeV. This is because the lower limit of mS has been determined to\nbe 50 (74) GeV for mh = 120 (200) GeV, as shown in Fig. 4, and upper limit of m\u03a6 is\nconstrained by the condition 2m\u03a6 < mh . From Fig. 8, similar to [10], it turns out that\nthe invisible Higgs decay width dominates the total width everywhere except in the vicinity\n2m\u03c6 = mH . This means that a tremendous suppression of the observable Higgs signal may\nhappen at the LHC.\n(b) Case for singlet scalar dark matter: For this case, we plot the prediction for R\nin Fig. 9 and the result is turned out to be almost the same as that in [10]. Similar to\nthe above case, the invisible width also dominates the total width everywhere except the\nregion 2m\u03a6 \u2243 mh [10]. We notice that when mh = 120 (200) GeV and \u03a9h2 = 0.128 the\nparameter space below m\u03a6 = 42 (56) GeV are excluded by the current bound obtained\nfrom XENON10 Dark Matter experiment.

Here the shadowed region represents the forbidden\nregion by XENON10 Dark Matter Experiment [20], which applies only to our model.\n\nfrom XENON10 Dark Matter Experiment [20], the mass of scalar boson m\u03a6 should be\nlarger than 42 (56) GeV for mh = 120 (200) GeV and \u03a9h2 = 0.128. Then, the values of R\nin our model is constrained to be 0.1 \u2212 1 (0.64 \u2212 1) where the upper limit is determined by\nthe condition 2m\u03a6 < mh as it should be.\n(ii) Case for 2m\u03a6 > mh :\nIn this case, the singlet scalar bosons can be produced only through virtual Higgs exchange.\nSimilar to the previous case, the produced singlet scalar particles can be detected as missing\nenergy above an energy threshold, E \u2265 2m\u03a6 . In this case, LHC is unlikely place for discovery\nof a missing energy signal, whereas future linear collider might be a good place for detecting\nsuch a signal.\n\n18\n\n\fVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have considered a variant of seesaw mechanism by introducing extra singlet neutrinos\nand singlet scalar boson and showed how low scale leptogenesis is realized in our scenario. We\nhave examined if the newly introduced neutral particles, either singlet Majorana neutrinos\nor singlet scalar boson, can be a candidate for dark matter. We have shown that the coannihilation process between dark matter candidate and the next lightest Z2 odd particle plays\na crucial role in generating the right amount of the relic density of dark matter candidate.\nWe have also discussed the implications of the dark matter detection through the scattering\noff the nucleus of the detecting material on our scenarios for dark matter candidate. From\nthe recent result of XENON10 Dark Matter experiment, we could get some constraint on\nthe mass of singlet scalar boson. In addition, we have studied the implications for the search\nof invisible Higgs decay at LHC which may serve as a probe of our scenarios for dark matter.\n\nAcknowledgement: SKK is supported by the KRF Grant funded by the Korean Government(MOEHRD) (KRF-2006-003-C00069).
