Sellwood\nDepartment of Physics & Astronomy, Rutgers University\n136 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08855\nAbstract. Newtonian mechanics indicates that galaxies and galaxy clusters are much more massive than we would have guessed from their luminosities, with the discrepancy being generally attributed to dark matter\nhalos. An alternative hypothesis is that accelerations in very weak gravitational fields are larger than predicted by Newton's laws, and there is\nno need for dark matter. Even though we do not currently have a satisfactory theory associated with this rival hypothesis, we can ask whether\nany observational tests could rule it out or prefer it over the dark matter\nhypothesis. Current evidence suggests that neither hypothesis enjoys a\ndecisive advantage over the other. If dark matter turns out to be the correct interpretation however, then theories of galaxy formation face some\nquite severe fine-tuning problems.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe succcess of the currently favored \u039bCDM model for structure formation (e.g.\nBahcall et al. 1999; White, this meeting) has persuaded many people to abandon\nalternatives (e.g. Binney, these proceedings). But the absence of a well-worked\nalternative should never be sufficient reason to decide that a particular model is\ncorrect. Despite dark matter being a central ingredient of this popular model,\nour only evidence for its existence is the gravitationally inferred mass discrepancies, and it is becoming clear that there are significant difficulties with its\napparent properties (e.g. Ostriker & Steinhardt 2003). Furthermore, alternative\ngravity ideas continue to meet with some success. I therefore prefer to keep an\nopen mind until experimental evidence for one or other interpretation of mass\ndiscrepancies becomes compelling.\nHere I review the rationale for alternative gravity theories (\u00a72) and argue\n(\u00a73) that galaxy formation theory does not provide decisive evidence in favor of\ndark matter. I then try to outline possible experimental ways in which the two\nhypotheses to account for mass discrepancies could be distinguished. If dark\nmatter is an elementary particle, then it may be possible to detect it directly\n(see \u00a74). Alternatively, two types of astronomical observations might favor one\nor other interpretation: (a) the acoustic oscillations in the cosmic microwave\nbackground (\u00a75), and (b) whether light is a good tracer of the mass. The second\nis a many faceted question, ranging from the issue of whether the rotation curve\nof a galaxy can be predicted from its luminosity profile (\u00a76), to whether the dark\nmatter halos have a different shape, or are misaligned with the light, or have\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. A. Sellwood\n\nsubstructure not associated with luminous features (\u00a77). Finally, I review some\ntheoretical arguments related to mergers (\u00a78).\n2.\n\nModifications to basic laws\n\nThe puzzles presented by dark matter and especially by dark energy are severe,\nbut not yet sufficient to compel us to reject the laws that seem to require their\nexistence. Yet it is legitimate to explore whether alternative laws could lead to a\nsimpler and more beautiful picture. A simplified picture would be attractive only\nif it were consistent with all current data, and compelling if it could make testable\npredictions that differ from those of the standard paradigm. Unfortunately, no\nsuggestion as yet comes close to meeting these ideals.\nThe apparent flatness of the universe (e.g. Hinshaw et al. 2003) is generally interpreted to imply a critical energy density in a Friedmann model. The\ncurrent \u039bCDM model supposes the energy density to be composed of an ugly\nmixture of \u223c 70% dark energy, \u223c 25% dark matter, \u223c 4% baryonic matter, and\nmaybe as much as 1 \u2212 2% in neutrinos, although this last number is an upper\nlimit that may well be much less. Not only is it unattractive to have several\ncomponents having similar densities, but the interpretation of the dark energy\nas Einstein's cosmological constant requires us to live at a special time just\nwhen the matter and dark energy densities are comparable; matter was dominant until relatively recently, and dark energy is now becoming dominant as the\nexpansion reaccelerates. Finally, the value of the vacuum energy density is lower\nthan na\u0131\u0308ve estimates based on elementary quantum mode counting by some 120\norders of magnitude, a discrepancy for which physics is completely unable to\naccount (e.g. Weinberg 2000). Tracking quintessence models (e.g. Wang et al.\n2000) and cyclic universe models (e.g. Khoury et al. 2003) answer some of these\nobjections, while Padmanabhan & Choudhury (2002) suggest that perhaps a\nsingle scalar field could account for both the dark energy and the dark matter \u2013\nan idea that would seem to merit further investigation.\nThe particularly severe problems presented by dark energy have driven even\nmainstream physicists (e.g. Arkani-Hamed et al. 2002; Carroll et al. 2003) to\nspeculate that it may instead reflect a breakdown of general relativity on the\nhorizon scale. But there are far fewer physicists who would argue that dark\nmatter, for which the evidence is also exclusively gravitational, is another manifestation of new gravitational physics. One reason for this different attitude is\nthat a weakly-interacting, massive particle (WIMP), of the kind predicted by supersymmetry, would survive as a relic from the early universe with an expected\nabundance of order the critical density (e.g. Kolb & Turner 1990, \u00a75.6).\nIt has therefore been left to a rather renegade group of mostly astronomers\nto argue for alternatives to dark matter, and several such ideas have been reviewed at this meeting by Aguirre (these proceedings). By far the best known of\nthese alternative ideas is MOND, first proposed by Milgrom (1983), with a more\nsophisticated formulation being given by Bekenstein & Milgrom (1984). Their\noriginal proposal was a modification of Newton's law of gravity that would automatically ensure asymptotically flat rotation curves for galaxies and the Tully4 , with no requirement for dark matter. This\nFisher law of the form M \u221d Vflat\nproposal has led to a fitting formula for galaxy rotation curves of remarkable\n\n\fIAU 220\n\n3\n\npower (see below), but as a theory of gravity (or of inertia) it is very poorly\nfounded, probably wrong in details (at least), makes no clear predictions about\nthe gravitational deflection of light, and does not remove the need for all dark\nmatter in galaxy clusters (Aguirre, Schaye & Quataert 2001; Sanders 2003).\nPartly for these reasons, I do not focus on MOND, but attempt to enumerate possible tests that could distinguish between dark matter and any generic\nalternative gravity hypothesis.\n3.\n\nStructure and galaxy formation\n\nThe hierarchical clustering of galaxies is believed to have arisen from almost homogeneous initial conditions through gravitational instability. It is well-known\nthat Newtonian gravity arising from baryonic perturbations alone could not drive\nthe evolution from the observed tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background to the highly non-linear clustering hierarchy of galaxies, groups, clusters\nand voids we measure today; dark matter drives the clustering in the standard\npicture. However, Sanders (2001) argues heuristically, and Nusser (2002) and\nKnebe & Gibson (2003) show, that stronger-than-Newtonian accelerations of\nthe kind contemplated here do accelerate the rate of evolution to yield an approximation to the observed clustering hierarchy. As yet, it is unclear whether\nthe results can be consistent with all data. The weakness of this argument is\nthat we lack an appealing, generally covariant, alternative theory of gravity on\nwhich to base a self-consistent calculation without dark matter. It is therefore\nnot possible to use structure formation arguments to distinguish dark matter\nmodels from alternative gravity models, because we do not yet know how the\npredictions in the two scenarios might differ.\nWhile large-scale structure is a clear success for \u039bCDM, the properties of\ngalaxies on smaller scales are more problematic. Sellwood & Kosowsky (1999)\ngive a now rather dated list of the difficulties confronting galaxy formation in the\nstandard \u039bCDM model. Since other speakers at this meeting have expanded on\nthese difficulties, I do not try to update this list here. Furthermore, it is generally\nargued that the shortcomings of the current model do not neccessarily imply its\nfailure, but may instead reflect the fact that the predictions are simply too crude.\nIt is clearly desirable to continue to refine the predictions from the \u039bCDM model,\nbut it seems unlikely that all problems will evaporate as calculations improve.\n4.\n\nDirect detection of WIMPs\n\nWIMPs are the most popular dark matter candidate. Their interaction crosssection with normal baryonic matter, while extremely small, is expected to be\nnon-zero. We may therefore be able to detect them directly and a number of\nexperiments are underway. Aside from the puzzling seasonal variation in their\ndetection rate reported by the DAMA collaboration (Bernabei et al. 2003) all\nother experiments have so far failed to show a positive signal (e.g. Akerib et al.\n2003; Sanglard et al. 2003; etc.), and some almost completely exclude a particle\nthat could have been responsible for the DAMA result.\nThe absence of a positive detection is of no great significance at the current\nsensitivity levels. Most experiments barely reach the sensitivity required to\n\n\f4\n\nJ. A. Sellwood\n\ndetect even the most optimistic models for the properties of WIMPs (e.g. Cline\n2003). Sensitivity is being improved all the time, but there is a long way to go\nbefore non-detections would begin to rule out interesting WIMP candidates.\nIt is expected that WIMPs and their anti-particles should be present in\nalmost equal numbers. Annihilation radiation will be emitted at an enhanced\nrate from high-density regions, such as a dark matter cusp in the center of\na galaxy (Bertone et al. 2001). Mayer-Hasselwander et al. (1998) report an\nEGRET detection of an unidentified gamma ray source in the Galactic center,\nbut it is now believed not to be coincident with the Galactic center direction\nand is too concentrated to arise from annihilation radiation (Hooper & Dingus\n2002). The non-detection by EGRET does not tell us much about WIMPs in\nthe Milky Way halo, since the densest part of the predicted cusp could easily\nhave been erased by normal astrophysical processes (e.g. Merritt et al. 2002).\nThe increased sensitivity of the future GLAST satellite may be sufficient to\ndetect the expected diffuse gamma radiation (e.g. Wai 2002; but see also Evans\net al. 2003). [Boehm et al. (2003) speculate that the INTEGRAL detection of\n511 keV radiation from the Galactic Center could be annihilation radiation from\na low-mass dark matter particle.] A convincing detection of diffuse annihilation\nradiation would be conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter in the\nform of WIMPs.\n5.\n\nAcoustic oscillations in the CMB\n\nTemperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are believed to\narise from accoustic oscillations seeded by primordial density fluctuations. Analysis of the power spectrum yields much information about the nature of the universe (Jungman et al. 1996). The first peak arises from the largest scale density\nvariations that have just had time to collapse since they entered the horizon.\nThe second peak, at higher l, occurs for smaller scale waves that entered the\nhorizon at an earlier time and have had time to rebound to the maximum rarefaction. The third peak is on the scale of those waves that have achieved a\nsecond collapse, etc.\nSince baryonic oscillations are damped (Silk 1968), the heights of the successive peaks should decrease monotonically in the absence of dark matter. Density\nvariations in the dark matter, however, do not oscillate because there is no pressure term \u2013 the material interacts with neither the photons nor the baryons.\nThe self-gravity of the photon-baryon plasma oscillating in the potential variations caused by the dominant dark matter causes the odd-numbered peaks (from\ncollapses) to be higher relative to the even ones (from rarefactions), which is a\ngeneric signal of dark-matter driven oscillations (Hu & Sugiyama 1996, Hu &\nWhite 1996). Thus, we need to examine whether the third peak is higher than\nthe second.\nUnfortunately, the height of the third peak is not yet strongly constrained\nby the data. The best fit model (Spergel et al. 2003) places it at about the same\nheight as the second peak, but the error bars on the first year WMAP data are\nquite large at this scale. The unconventional analysis by \u00d6dman (2003) suggests\nthat other experiments may have systematic errors, since she suggests that the\nrelative height of the third peak depends on the frequency of the observation,\n\n\fIAU 220\n\n5\n\nwhich should not be the case. The relative heights of the second and third peaks\nwill not be determined until we have better data \u2013 perhaps soon to come from\nWMAP. A third peak clearly higher than the second would provide stronger,\nless model-dependent, evidence for dark matter than is currently indicated by\nthe first year WMAP data (Spergel et al. 2003; see also McGaugh 2003).\n6.\n\nLight as a predictor of mass\n\nThere is no doubt that Newtonian mechanics requires mass-to-light ratios that\nincrease with increasing scale (e.g. Bahcall et al. 1995). Modified gravity theories, which are proposed in order to account for this fact, actually require much\nmore: a unique relationship between the baryonic mass and the dynamical mass.\nThis stringent requirement leads to a number of specific predictions that makes\nthem much more easily falsified than is the dark matter hypothesis.\nThe relationship between the observed baryonic mass and the inferred Newtonian dynamical mass can, in principle, depend on spatial scale, or acceleration\n(as in MOND), or some other property, but the relation must be universal.\nVariations in the baryonic/dark mass ratio in similar objects could arise in dark\nmatter models, but cannot be tolerated in modified gravity models. Two wellestablished examples where this holds are the Tully-Fisher relation for galaxies\nand the absence of bias in the galaxy distribution; the 2dF galaxy redshift survey team (Verde et al. 2002) conclude that \"optically selected galaxies do indeed\ntrace the underlying mass distribution.\" Estimates of bias on smaller scales (e.g.\nPen et al. 2003) are still subject to significant uncertainties.\nFurthermore, modified gravity theories require the gravitational potential\nwell to reflect the shape and orientation of the luminous matter. Dark matter\nhalos, on the other hand, can have much more general shapes and may also be\nmisaligned with the orientation of the luminous matter. These predictions are\nconfronted by available data in this section.\n6.1.\n\nDetailed rotation curve shapes\n\nKalnajs's (1983) dramatic demonstration that the inner parts of galaxy rotation\ncurves can be predicted from the light distribution by a simple mass-traces-light\nmodel has been amply confirmed in many subsequent investigations (Kent 1986;\nBuchhorn 1992; Broeils & Courteau 1997; Palunas & Williams 2000; Sancisi,\nthese proceedings). However, such models based on Newtonian dynamics generally fail at larger radii, where the predicted rotation curve falls below that\nobserved.\nThe outstanding triumph of MOND is that it has yielded a formula that\nis able to predict the entire detailed rotation curve of a disk galaxy from the\nlight profile. This achievement goes considerably further than its original motivation and works best for the galaxies for which the best data are available, as\nfirst shown for a sample of 10 galaxies by Begeman, Broeils & Sanders (1996).\nSanders & McGaugh (2002) increase the sample to \u223c 75 well-studied disk galaxies.\nMOND rotation curve fits have only the mass-to-light ratio, \u03a5, for the stellar\ncomponent(s) as a free parameter. In some cases, the distance to the galaxy\nmight require adjustment because the actual acceleration within the galaxy,\n\n\f6\n\nJ. A. Sellwood\n\nV 2 /R, is distance-dependent, while the characteristic acceleration a0 that enters\nthe fitting formula is not. Generally the fits are quite successful for the standard\ndistance to the galaxy, but adjustments to improve the fits can be as large as\na factor 2 in a few cases. A distance required for a good MOND fit could, in\nprinciple, be excluded by independent distance indicators, and the few cases\nwhere this could potentially invalidate MOND are discussed in Bottema et al.\n(2002).\nMilgrom & Sanders (2003) demonstrate that the declining rotation curves\nin elliptical galaxies recently announced by Romanowsky et al. (2003) are also\nin accord with MOND predictions. Gerhard et al. (2001) argue that mass discrepancies begin to appear in elliptical galaxies at much stronger accelerations,\n\u223c 10a0 , although their conclusion is also strongly challenged by Milgrom &\nSanders (2003). If it can be convincingly demonstrated that the value of a0\nis not universal, the success of MOND for spiral galaxies could no longer be\ninterpreted as a manifestion of an unknown universal physical law.\nIt should be emphasized that conventional dark matter fits have three free\nparameters: \u03a5, and two halo parameters, such as the core radius, r0 , and Vflat\nfor the psuedo-isothermal halo, or the concentration, c, and V200 for an NFW\nhalo. The success of MOND fits, with essentially only a single parameter, therefore cannot be dismissed lightly. If dark matter halos are, in fact, present in\nthese galaxies, then the impressive success of the MOND fitting formula implies\nan intimate connection between the dark and luminous matter that presents a\ndaunting fine-tuning problem for dark matter models.\nKaplinghat & Turner (2002) attempt to show that a characteristic acceleration of the MOND value emerges \"naturally\" from the CDM model, but their\nclaim is weak. They show only that the acceleration within a galaxy at which\ndark matter begins to dominate is of the order of MOND's a0 . Since their analysis uses the Gaussian initial fluctuation spectrum, they inevitably predict a\nspread in a0 that is not required and they fail utterly to account for the spectacular accuracy of the MOND fits to the detailed rotation curve shapes.\n6.2.\n\nDark lenses?\n\nThe case for dark matter would be essentially made if we were able to discover\nobjects with extremely high, almost infinite, M/L. The only way such objects\nmight be discovered is through gravitational lensing. Schneider (these proceedings) remarks that there are no known examples of strong lensing by a dark\nobect, but a few such claims have been made from weak lensing.\nProbably the strongest claimed detection of a dark cluster is by Erben et al.\n(2000), who find a \"robust\" lensing signal suggesting a previously unidentified\ndark mass concentration of perhaps 1014 M\u2299 . There is no visible galaxy cluster\nand little X-ray emission from the position of this apparent mass concentration.\nHowever, it is hard to imagine how a real dark cluster-mass object could have\navoided collecting enough hot gas to be X-ray bright. It is possible that the lensing signal is spurious and arises from intrinsic alignments among the background\ngalaxies.\nWeak lensing surveys, e.g. by Tyson's group (Jarvis et al. 2003), should\nreveal more such cases if they are common, but none has shown up so far. In\nfact, the lensing mass does not have to be completely dark to rule out alternative\n\n\fIAU 220\n\n7\n\ngravity theories, large variations in M/L between similar lensing-mass clusters\nwould be sufficient.\n\n7.\n\nHalo shapes\n\nSimulations of large-scale structure formation have revealed that the dark matter\nhalos of galaxies and clusters are expected to be triaxial. The detailed distribution of halo shapes reported by the different groups varies slightly (see reviews\nby Springel and by Jing, these proceedings), but most authors find many nearly\nprolate shapes. It is also known (Dubinski 1994) that baryonic infall makes the\nhalo more nearly axisymmetric.\nA na\u0131\u0308ve prediction from alternative gravity theories might be that the potential is flattened near a flattened light distribution and becomes more nearly\nspherical further away, since the higher order moments of the potential drop off\nmore quickly. Aguirre (these proceedings) points out that this simple-minded\nexpectation is not necessarily true, especially in MOND.\nThe meager data on the shapes of dark matter halos are reviewed by Sackett\nand by Arnaboldi (these proceedings). I continue to be impressed by the absence\nof a clear detection of a strongly non-axisymmetric extended HI disk that can\nbe attributed to a triaxial dark matter halo. Bekki & Freeman (2002) speculate\nthat spirals in the outer disk of NGC 2915 arise from a rotating triaxial halo, but\nother intepretations are possible (e.g. Masset & Bureau 2003). The startlingly\nround outer ring of IC 2002 (Franx et al. 1994) remains an isolated case. The lack\nof other cases could, perhaps, be a selection bias if gas in a non-axisymmetric\nhalo is driven inwards by shocks until it reaches a closely axisymmetric potential.\n7.1.\n\nMisalignments\n\nKochanek (2002) could find no evidence for misalignments between the luminous\nmatter and the lensing mass distribution in a number of strong lens systems, and\nconcluded that \"Mass traces light.\" Perhaps yet more impressive is the claim\nby Hoekstra et al. (2003) of a detectable flattening of the dark matter halos in a\nstatistical analysis of weak lensing data from stacking a large number of galaxies.\nIf halos were mostly prolate, and the density axes at larger radii were twisted at\nrandom angles from those in the inner parts, the flattening found by Hoekstra et\nal. (2003) should not be detectable. (See Aguirre, these proceedings, for further\ndiscussion of their paper.)\nBuote et al. (2002), on the other hand, argue that alternative gravity theories can be excluded by their claim of misalignment between the flattened x-ray\nhalo of NGC 720 and the optical image. It is noteworthy that their estimate\nof the shape and orientation of the halo changed greatly from their earlier estimates based on ROSAT data to this recent anaylsis of Chandra data, due mainly\nto the elimination of point sources. The lumpy nature of the x-ray isophotes in\neven their cleaned Chandra image may indicate further contamination by fainter\npoint soucres, or it may indicate that the halo gas is subject to non-gravitational\nforces, or has has yet to settle. While this one case is not sufficiently compellling\nto rule out alternative gravity models, their research program is one of the few\nwith this goal.\n\n\f8\n7.2.\n\nJ. A. Sellwood\nSubstructure\n\nDalal & Kochanek (2002) argue that the flux ratio anomalies observed in a\nsignificant number of quadruple image lens systems indicate the presence of\nsubstructure in the dark matter halo. Convincing evidence for the mini-halos\npredicted in CDM models would constitute decisive support for dark matter.\nMao (these proceedings) reviews the evidence, finding a number of puzzles, but\nconcludes that mini-halos are the most likely explanation for flux anomalies,\nwhile Schechter (these proceedings) argues that alternative explanations are hard\nto rule out.\n\n8.\n\nGalaxy mergers\n\nBinney & Toomre asked whether modified gravity theories could be consistent\nwith galaxy mergers; specifically, whether galaxies that fall together could merge\nif there are no DM halos to take up the orbital energy and angular momentum?\nBinney & Tremaine (1987) argue that a pair of similar, spherical galaxies approaching each other will dissipate their orbital energy and angular momentum\nand merge within a Hubble time for some limited range of specific orbital energies and angular momenta. In a modified gravity picture, the two galaxies\nwould accelerate towards each other more strongly, and would therefore acquire\nmuch greater kinetic energy and angular momentum for their masses, making a\nmerger less likely. The effect will scarcely be compensated by increased orbit-tointernal exchanges during the interaction, because forces during the encounter\nare closer to the Newtonian regime.\nMergers can occur even without dark halos, for sufficiently slow passages, as\ndemonstrated for Newtonian dynamics by Toomre & Toomre (1972). Modified\ngravity is unlikely to change this conclusion, but will make such encounters rarer.\nThe question then becomes a quantitative one of whether the merger rate will be\nsufficiently suppressed by modified gravity to be inconsistent with that observed.\nA clear answer to this question requires a detailed calculation that has yet to\nbe performed, and will depend on the nature of the modification. Two further\npoints are worth making: First, Toomre's (1977) idea that elliptical galaxies are\nproducts of mergers seems to be holding up, but most were probably in place\nalready at moderately high redshift (e.g. van Dokkum & Ellis 2003), perhaps\nbefore the time that departures from Newtonian dynamics become significant\n(Sanders 2001). Second, Hickson compact galaxy groups seem to undergo rapid\nmergers (Barnes 1989) in conventional dark matter models, making the presentday frequency of these groups difficult to understand \u2013 but see also White (1990);\nmodified gravity theories should ease this difficulty.\nStudies of individual cases are always revealing. Dubinski et al. (1999) argue\nthat tidal tails require rather low density dark matter halos in conventional\ndynamics. Comparable studies with modified gravity have not been reported,\nbut would seem to be warranted. In particular, it would be very interesting\nto test whether simulations of merging systems with dark matter can account\nfor the dramatically more concentrated stellar component in elliptical galaxies\nreported by Romanowsky et al. (2003).\n\n\fIAU 220\n9.\n\n9\n\nConclusions\n\nThis very brief survey of the available data has turned up no really decisive\nevidence either in favor of dark matter or that could rule out alternative gravity\ntheories. To form a scorecard, I regard the strongest evidence in favor of dark\nmatter as the CMB power spectrum and the explanation of flux ratio anomalies\nin quadruple lenses in terms of halo substructure. On the other hand, new\ngravitational physics is favored by the extraordinarily clear relationship between\nthe light and mass distributions in galaxies, and the lensing evidence (Kochanek\n2002, Hoekstra et al. 2003) that the mass distribution seems to be aligned with\nthe light \u2013 Buote et al. (2002) notwithstanding. The evidence from halo shapes\nis too fragmentary to put in either column.\nIt needs to be stressed that the success of MOND fits to rotation curves\nand the alignment of lensing mass with the visible mass distribution create very\nserious fine-tuning problems if mass discrepancies are indeed caused by dark\nmatter halos.\nAs always, more data will help; it is especially desirable to pursue M/L\nvariations, misalignments, substructure, etc., since alternative gravity ideas can\nbe more easily falsified by such evidence than can dark matter models. Decisive\nevidence for dark matter may come soon from a firm measurement of the relative heights of the 2nd and 3rd peaks in the CMB, possibly even from WMAP,\nor from a detection of annihilation radiation by the future GLAST mission. In\nthe present absence of decisive evidence on either side, the peculiarities highlighted here seem significant enough to encourage further attempts to develop\nalternative gravity theories from which testable predictions could be made.\nAcknowledgments.
