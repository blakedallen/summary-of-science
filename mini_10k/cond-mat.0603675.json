We implement the detection using both fluorescence into the cavity and reduction in cavity transmission due\nto the presence of atoms. In fluorescence, we register 2.0(2) photon counts per atom, which allows\nus to detect single atoms with 75% efficiency in 250 \u03bcs. In absorption, we measure transmission\nattenuation of 3.3(3)% per atom, which allows us to count small numbers of atoms with a resolution\nof about 1 atom.\n\nIn the past several years, there have been many promising developments in the field of microfabricated magnetic\ntraps (microtraps) for ultracold atoms, including experimental realizations of microtrap-based atom interferometers [1, 2], atomic clocks [3], and Bragg reflectors [4].\nCompared to optical traps, where significant progress\nin interferometry [5], Josephson junctions [6] and onedimensional physics [7, 8, 9] has been made, microchips\noffer smaller length scales and tighter confinement for\nsingle traps, which, however, may require working with\nsmall atom numbers. Furthermore, there are many proposed atom chip experiments, such as the implementation of a Tonks-Girardeau gas [10, 11] or an atomic\nFabry-Perot interferometer [12] in a magnetic trap, that\nmay greatly benefit from measuring atom statistics and\ncorrelations at the single-atom level, as has recently been\ndemonstrated in a free-space experiment [13]. In addition, the preparation and detection of single atoms in\nmicrotraps constitute an important step toward quantum\ninformation processing with neutral atoms, which could\ntake advantage of the tight, complex, precisely controlled,\nand scalable magnetic traps available on microchips [14].\nIn this context, the problem arises of how to detect small\natom numbers in magnetic microtraps close to a substrate surface with a good signal-to-noise ratio [15, 16].\nWhile cavity QED experiments [17, 18] can detect and\ncount single atoms in the strong coupling regime, integrating very-high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavities with atom\nchips may prove difficult [16]. Observing small atom\nnumbers through fluorescence in a magneto-optical trap\n(MOT) [19] or in MOT-loaded dipole traps [20, 21] requires long measurement times, and is also not easily\ncompatible with chip traps. While experimental progress\nhas recently been made in incorporating fiber resonators\n[22] and microcavities [23] into atom chips, the capabilities of such detection methods remain to be established.\nRecently, a low-finesse concentric cavity was used for\nsensitive detection of atoms in a macroscopic magnetic\nwaveguide in a free-space geometry [24].\nAtom detection can be implemented via fluorescence\n[19, 20, 21] or absorption methods [13, 17, 18]. To compare the two methods, consider a sample of a atoms,\nwhere each atom on average scatters m photons, and\nthe imaging system detects a fraction \u03b1 of the photons.\nIf background counts can be neglected, the atom number uncertainty \u2206a in fluorescence detection is given by\n\ngravity\n\nz\nribbon bridge P\n\ny\nx\nfluorescence pump beam\natoms\ncavity mode\n\nto single\nphoton\ncounter\n\nQ\ncavity mirrors\n\nFIG. 1: Cavity and microfabricated chip (not to scale). The\nchip wires (Q) generate a 2D quadrupole field in the xz plane.\nThe ribbon (P ) in combination with an external field gradient creates the confinement along y. The atoms are probed\neither with a pump beam from the side to induce fluorescence\ninto the cavity or through the absorption of a beam coupled\nthrough the cavity.\n\n\u221a\nthe ratio between the photon shot noise, p\na\u03b1m, and the\nsignal per atom, \u03b1m, and equal to \u2206a = a/\u03b1m. Consequently, in fluorescence measurements, the resolution\ndecreases as the square root of the atom number.\nFor the equivalent absorption measurement, we assume\nthe same number m of scattered photons per atom, an\nabsorption beam matched to the collection optics, and\nlow total absorption. Then, thepnumber of incoming photons is m/\u03b1 with a shot noise m/\u03b1.\np This results in an\natom number uncertainty of \u2206a = 1/\u03b1m, independent\nof atom number and equal to the fluorescence resolution\nfor a = 1. Thus, while fluorescence detection may provide a superior single-atom detector if background counts\nare negligible, absorption detection should perform better as a single-shot atom counter. Cavity-aided detection\nis attractive for both fluorescence and absorption methods, since the emission of light into the cavity is enhanced\nby the Purcell factor F/\u03c0, where F is the cavity finesse\n[25].\nIn this paper, we investigate the detection and counting of small numbers of atoms in a magnetic microtrap\nusing a macroscopic, medium-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity employing both fluorescence and absorption detection techniques. Using shot-noise-limited atom preparation down to 1 atom, we achieve single-atom sensitivity\nin the fluorescence scheme, and a resolution of about 1\natom in absorption.\n\n\f2\n40\n\n\u00e1n2\u00f1/\u00e1n\u00f1-1\n\nOur experimental setup (Fig. 1) is similar to that described in Ref. [26]. 87 Rb atoms are trapped and cooled\nin a free-space magneto-optical trap, transferred to a\nmagnetic trap, which is then moved close to the chip\nand adiabatically transformed into a Ioffe-Pritchard microtrap. The radial (xz) confinement of the chip trap is\nprovided by two 2-\u03bcm-high, 500-\u03bcm-wide gold wires Q,\nwhose centers are separated by 1 mm, carrying antiparallel currents along the y direction, in superposition with\na bias field along z. The axial (y) confinement is created\nby a current through a gold ribbon bridge P along x, 500\n\u03bcm away from the chip's surface, in combination with an\nexternal field gradient along y. We have mounted highreflectivity, low-loss mirrors on opposite sides of the chip\nto form a 2.66 cm long near-confocal cavity with TEM00\nmode waist w of 56 \u03bcm, finesse F = 8600, linewidth\n\u03ba/2\u03c0 = 650 kHz, free spectral range of 5630 MHz, and\ntransverse mode spacing of 230 MHz, aligned along the\naxis of our magnetic trap and located 200 \u03bcm away from\nthe chip surface, so that the cavity mode passes between\nthe bridge bond and the chip. The mode waist is displaced longitudinally by 5.6 mm relative to the microtrap. For the fluorescence measurement, a retroreflected\npump beam with a waist of 250 \u03bcm at the position of the\natoms is coupled from the side of the cavity at an angle\nof 70\u25e6 to the cavity axis.\nWe prepare our atoms by initially loading them into\na Ioffe-Pritchard microtrap located 200 \u03bcm away from\nthe surface and displaced to the side of the cavity axis in\norder to prevent them from being heated by the cavity\nlength stabilization light. We then use a fast radiofrequency (RF) evaporation to remove the vast majority of\nthe atoms, leaving us with a small number of cold atoms\nat a typical temperature of 15 \u03bcK. Once we have the sample ready, we ramp the magnetic field to move the trap\ninto the cavity mode, turn off the locking light, and perform the fluorescence or absorption measurement. When\nlocated in the cavity, the magnetic trap has a radial gradient of 200 G/cm, which corresponds to transverse vibration frequencies around 300 Hz for typical offset fields,\nand an axial vibration frequency of 50 Hz.\nUsing optics outside the vacuum chamber, we couple\nup to 95% of the light entering the cavity into the TEM00\nmode. The light exiting the cavity is mode-matched to a\nsingle-mode fiber, which allows for excellent spatial filtering of background light, and delivered to a single-photoncounting module (SPCM). We stabilize our cavity to an\noff-resonant laser of a linewidth slightly broader than\nthat of the cavity using a Pound-Drever-Hall\n\u221a scheme.\nThe stability of our cavity lock\nis\n140\nkHz/\n10kHz for\n\u221a\na locked cavity, and 400 kHz/ 10kHz in the several ms\nafter the locking light is extinguished, which is when we\nperform our measurements.\nBoth absorption and fluorescence signals in cavityaided detection depend on the atoms' scattering rate of\nphotons into the cavity. For an atom on the cavity axis,\nthe ratio \u03b7 of its scattering rate into each of the two\ndirections of the cavity, \u0393c , to its scattering rate into\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u00e1n\u00f1\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFIG. 2: Characterization of the atom number preparation\nnoise and detected photon number per atom for fluorescence\ndetection. n denotes the number of signal photons detected.\nThe atom-atom correlation function, gaa , is given by the\nslope, and the average number of photon counts per atom,\nhpi, is given by the y-axis intercept.\n\nfree space, \u0393s , is given by the single-atom cooperativity,\n\u03b7 = 6F/(\u03c0(wk)2 ), where w is the cavity mode waist size\nand k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb with \u03bb as the optical wavelength resonant\nwith the cavity mode; for our cavity, \u03b7 = 0.07. To confirm our atom-cavity coupling experimentally, we measure the tuning of the transmission resonance by samples\nlarge enough that the atom number can be determined\nby standard absorption techniques. The tuning of the\ncavity resonance by an atom well-localized at the cavity\nwaist is given by \u03b4\u03bd = (\u03ba/2)(\u0393/\u2206)N \u03b7, where \u0393 is the\nlinewidth of the atomic transition, \u2206 \u226b \u0393 is the detuning between the laser and the atomic transition, and N is\nthe atom number. The measurement of \u03b4\u03bd yields a value\nof \u03b7 between 0.015 and 0.025, in good agreement with\nthe value we would expect given our independent measurement of the cloud size, which reduces \u03b7 compared to\nthe on-axis case.\nTo characterize both the atom number preparation and\nthe number of photon counts per atom in fluorescence\ndetection, we illuminate the atoms with a near-resonant\npump beam just above saturation and count the photons emerging from the cavity within 750 \u03bcs. We compile histograms of counts for different RF final settings,\ni.e., different average numbers of prepared atoms. Given\nPoisson statistics for the detected photons, the following relation can be derived: hn2 i/hni \u2212 1 = gaa hni + hpi,\nwhere hai is the mean atom number, hpi is the mean number of photon counts per atom, n = ap is the number of\nsignal photon counts, and gaa is the atom-atom correlation function, which should be equal to 1 if the atoms\nstrictly obey Poisson statistics and equal to (1 + f 2 ) in\nthe presence of (technical) fractional atom number noise\nof magnitude f . The values of hn2 i/hni \u2212 1 can be computed from each histogram independently without any\nknowledge about hai or hpi, given that we can measure\nthe background count rate independently, and assuming\nthat fluctuations in the background are uncorrelated with\nfluctuations in the signal. The results, along with a linear fit, are plotted in Fig. 2. The fit gives a slope of\n\n\f3\n(b)\n3\n\n6\n\n2\n\n\u00e1p\u00f1\n\n0.10\n\n<\n\nprobability\n\n0.15\n\n\u00e1s\u00f1 [%]\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\ncounts\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n\u00e1a\u00f1\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Typical normalized histogram of 150 fluorescence\nmeasurements, with Poisson fit to hai, the mean number of\natoms, and hpi, the mean number of photon counts per atom.\nIn this case, hai = 3.1(4) and hpi = 1.7(3). Error bars are\nPoissonian uncertainties. (b) Results of Poisson fits to 12 different histograms, with error bars corresponding to 1 standard\ndeviation in hpi.\n\ngaa = 1.05(2), which implies that the fractional noise on\nour signal is 0.25(10), and therefore Poissonian fluctuations dominate for the atom numbers we measure, and\nan intercept of hpi = 1.9(3).\nHaving confirmed the Poisson statistics of our atom\nnumber preparation, we can fit the hai and hpi for each\nhistogram individually. A typical histogram with fit and\na plot of the combined results of all histogram fits are\nshown in Fig. 3. To a good approximation, the average number of photon counts per atom is independent\nof atom number at hpi = 2.0(2) counts/atom, with 0.3\nbackground counts. An average of the signal time traces\nyields a 1/e time of \u03c4 = 150 \u03bcs.\nSince our cavity resonance is much narrower than the\natomic line, the cavity collects predominantly the coherently scattered photons and only a small fraction of\nthe Mollow triplet [27]. The number of photon counts\nwe would expect to detect per atom is thus given by\nhpi = \u0393coh \u03c4 \u03b7(\u03ba/\u03b3) \u00d7 CG \u00d7 g \u00d7 f \u00d7 q \u00d7 l, where \u0393coh =\n\u0393/8 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 760 kHz is the maximum coherent scattering rate for the transition, \u03b7 = 0.07, \u03b3 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1 MHz is\nthe linewidth of the cavity transmission, which is a convolution of the cavity and laser linewidths, CG = 0.3\nis the averaged Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for \u03c3 + intracavity light coming from the scattering process (the\nother polarizations are not resonant with the cavity),\ng = 0.6 accounts for the finite size of the atomic cloud,\nf = 0.7 is the coupling efficiency into the single-mode\nfiber, q = 0.58 is the quantum efficiency of the SPCM,\nand l = 0.7 is the signal reduction due to measured meachanical cavity vibrations. The combination of the above\nfactors predicts hpi = 1.7, close to our measured value.\nIn order to quantify the performance of our fluorescence measurement as a single-atom detector, we reduced\nthe measurement window to 250 \u03bcs, and took a histogram\nwith, on average, less than one atom prepared. The Poisson fit to the resulting histogram gives hai = 0.85(8) and\nhpi = 1.4(1). Combined with a measured background\nof 0.07 counts, this means that, if we set our detection\nthreshold to \u2265 1 count, our single-atom detection is char-\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u00e1a \u00f1\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: Results of Poisson fits to hsi, the mean single-atom\nabsorption, and hai, the mean atom number, for 5 different\nhistograms.\n\nacterized by an atom quantum efficiency of 75% and a\nfalse detection rate of 7%, at a maximum single-atom\ncount rate of 4 kHz.\nWhile the fluorescence measurement makes a good\nsingle-atom detector, we expect an absorption measurement to provide better atom number resolution for a > 1.\nFor absorption detection, we couple the probe laser beam\ninto the cavity TEM00 mode and monitor the resonant\ntransmission through the cavity in the presence of atoms.\nThe laser linewidth is broadened by frequency modulation to 30 MHz, much wider than \u03ba, so that the intensity\nnoise on the cavity transmission due to cavity vibration\nis negligible compared to the photon shot noise. The\nlaser is tuned to atomic resonance with an intracavity\nsaturation parameter equal to 0.2. The expected transmission reduction due to one atom of a laser resonant\nwith the atomic transition is 2\u03b7. Similarly to fluorescence detection, we compile histograms for different sets\nof atom preparation parameters and fit them, assuming\nPoisson statistics for both the atoms and the photons, to\ndetermine the mean absorption per atom, hsi, and the\nmean atom number, hai. (A correlation function fit similar to the one for fluorescence confirms that our atom\npreparation for absorption has Poisson statistics, with\ngaa = 0.94(4).) The fitting results for hsi with varying\natom number are shown in Fig. 4. From these measurements, we obtain hsi = 3.3(3)% for 1 < hai < 10, in\ngood agreement with the expected absorption per atom,\nhsi = 3.2(7)%, when geometric factors due to finite cloud\nsize are taken into account.\nUsing the measured values of hpi = 2.0(2) counts/atom\nfor fluorescence detection and hsi = 3.3(2)% for absorption, we can evaluate how well these two methods can\ndetermine the atom number in a single measurement.\nThe expected atom number uncertainty \u03b4a using fluorescence (absorption) detection due to both photon shot\nnoise and the statistical uncertainty in the mean number\nof photons per atom, hpi (uncertainty in the mean absorption per atom, hsi), as well as the background photon counts (for fluorescence only), is plotted as a function of atom number in Fig. 5; the figure also includes\na computed normalized histogram that characterizes the\nsingle-atom detection capability of our fluorescence mea-\n\n\f4\n\nsurement. For fluorescence, the atom number resolution\nis limited by the shot noise of the collected signal photons, which grows with atom number, while, for absorption, where the number of collected photons actually decreases with atom number, the resolution remains nearly\n\nflat, at around 1 atom.\nThe demonstrated excellent atom number resolution\ncould be useful in a variety of microchip experiments. For\ninstance, a Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas could be created\nclose to the chip, where high radial vibration frequencies can be achieved. The sample could then be moved\ninto the cavity to measure both the atom number and\nthe density distribution of the gas. As an example, a\nquantum degenerate gas of 50 87 Rb atoms confined in\na magnetic trap with a radial trapping frequency of 20\nkHz and an axial frequency of 0.5 Hz would be deep in\nthe TG regime, with \u03b3 = 2/(n|a1D |) of 10, where \u03b3 \u226b 1\nmeans that the gas experiences strong fermionization, for\na peak one-dimensional number density n and an effective one-dimensional scattering length a1D [11]. Then\nthe spatial (30 \u03bcm) and atom number resolution of our\ndetector would allow one to distinguish the length and\ndensity distribution of this TG gas (l = 300 \u03bcm) from a\ncorresponding non-fermionized Thomas-Fermi gas with\nthe same atom number (l = 420 \u03bcm).\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated in situ detection of magnetically trapped atoms on a chip with the\naid of a medium-finesse macroscopic cavity, and characterized the performance for single-atom detection and\nfor atom number measurements using both fluorescence\nand absorption methods. We believe that, due to their\ncombination of versatility, performance, and ease of use,\nsuch cavity-aided detection schemes can play an important role in a broad range of applications in integrated\natom optics on chips.\nThis work was supported by the NSF and DARPA.\n\n[1] Y.-J.
