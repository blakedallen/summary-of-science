There have been worries that this divergence might show up in the Minkowski\namplitudes at MK = M\u03c0 with all the mesons at rest. Here we demonstrate, via an explicit calculation\nin leading-order Chiral Perturbation Theory, that the power divergence is absent at the above kinematic\npoint, as predicted by CPS symmetry.\n\nPACS numbers: 11.15.Ha,12.38.Gc,12.15Ff\n\n\fThe subtraction of a power divergence, which arises via the mixing of dimension-six four-fermion\noperators with those of lower dimension has been one of the central issues in lattice calculations of\n\u2206I = 1/2 K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes. This power divergence is of course unphysical, and can be related to a\nshift of the vacuum due to the inclusion of the weak interaction in Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7PT)\n[1, 2, 3, 4]. It results in the so-called tadpole operators, which contribute to the processes K 0 \u2192 |0i and\nK\u0304 0 \u2192 |0i, in \u03c7PT with weak interactions.\n\nAs argued in Ref. [5], this power divergence should be absent for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes when ms =\nmd = mu (mu,d,s are the masses of u, d and s quarks), due to the exact CPS symmetry [1] of the fourfermion operators that mediate K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays. In Ref. [6], it was argued that the power divergence\nindeed does disappear in Euclidean space at MK = M\u03c0 . However, a naive calculation in Minkowski space\nsuggests that this power divergence might still be present at MK = M\u03c0 when all mesons are at rest. The\nissue is relevant, as it has been proposed that this unphysical kinematic point can be used to extract the\nlow-energy constants relevant for \u2206I = 1/2 K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 to order p4 in \u03c7PT [7, 8].1\n\nIn this note, we show, via an explicit calculation in \u03c7PT, that also in Minkowski space the power\ndivergence is not present in \u2206I = 1/2 K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes at MK = M\u03c0 , with all mesons at rest. Since\nit has already been argued in Ref. [9] that the \u2206I = 1/2 K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes in partially quenched \u03c7PT\nat the kinematic point MK = M\u03c0 suffer from problems related to the lack of unitarity [6, 10, 11], we\nconcentrate here on full QCD. Our conclusions on the power divergence will however not change in the\n(partially) quenched case.\nTo simplify the discussion, we only consider weak operators in the (8, 1) irrep of SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R .\nThe weak mass operator in this irrep at O(p2 ) in the chiral expansion is\n(8,1)\n\nO2\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\b\n\u0002\n,\n= \u03b12 \u00d7 2B0 Tr \u03bb6 M\u2020 \u03a3 + \u03a3\u2020 M\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b12 is the (power-divergent) low-energy constant associated with this operator, B0 = \u2212h0|\u016bu +\n2\n \u0304\ndd|0i/f\n(in the chiral limit), \u03bb6 is a Gell-Mann matrix, M is the quark-mass matrix and \u03a3 is the\nstandard non-linear Goldstone field.\nWe first observe that CPS symmetry implies that the parity-odd part of this operator is proportional\nto ms \u2212 md . In fact,\n(8,1)\n\nO2\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n\b\n\u0002\n.\n= \u03b12 \u00d7 B0 (ms + md )Tr \u03bb6 \u03a3 + \u03a3\u2020 + iB0 (ms \u2212 md )Tr \u03bb7 \u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u2020\n\n(2)\n\nTherefore, at ms = md the parity-odd part of the operator vanishes, and thus its K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix element\nshould vanish as well for MK = M\u03c0 . This was confirmed by an explicit calculation in Euclidean space\n(as reported in Ref. [6]), and should be true in Minkowski space as well.\n\n(8,1)\n\nAt leading order in the chiral expansion, O2\ncontributes to the K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes via the\ndiagrams in Fig. 1, where the gray circles represent the weak mass operator, and the square is from the\nleading-order strong chiral Lagrangian. In diagram (b), there is a pole associated with the K\u0304 0 propagator\n(the dashed line in Fig. 1), which takes the form\n(MK\n\ni\n2 + i\u01eb ,\n\u2212 2M\u03c0 )2 \u2212 MK\n\n(3)\n\nwhen all the other three on-shell particles are at rest. For fixed MK 6= M\u03c0 , one may take \u01eb \u2192 0 at any\nstage of the calculation, since the denominator of Eq. (3) does not vanish in that case. However, for\nMK = M\u03c0 , the i\u01eb prescription is needed in order to define the propagator, and should be taken to zero\nonly at the end of the calculation. In that case, one finds:\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0001 8 (3M\u03c0 (MK \u2212 2M\u03c0 ) \u2212 i\u01eb)\n(8,1)\n2\n2\n+ \u2212\n0\n= 0, (4)\nlim \u03b12 \u00d7 MK \u2212 M\u03c0\nh\u03c0 \u03c0 |O2 |K iMK =M\u03c0 = lim\n\u01eb\u21920 MK \u2192M\u03c0\n3f 3 (4iM\u03c0 (MK \u2212 M\u03c0 ) + \u01eb)\n1 It\n\nfollows from our analysis that the low-energy constants \u03b12 and er1,2,5 should not appear in Eq. (31) of Ref. [8].\n\n1\n\n\f\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0+\n\nK\u0304 0\n\nK0\n\nK0\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 1: Diagrams involving the weak mass operator at the lowest order in the chiral expansion for the\n(8,1)\n\u2206I = 1/2 K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes. The gray circles represent the operator O2 , and the square is the\nK 0 K\u0304 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 vertex from the lowest-order strong chiral Lagrangian. The dashed line in (b) indicates\nthat the K\u0304 0 could be off-shell, while all the other mesons are always on-shell.\nwhich indicates that there is no need to perform the subtraction of a power divergence.\nLet us discuss this claim in some more detail. We begin by noting that it was shown long ago [1, 2, 3]\nR\n(8,1)\nis treated as a perturbation to the strong chiral Lagrangian, it\nthat if the weak mass term d4 xO2\ndoes not have any observable effect. However, here we consider the unphysical situation of an energy\n(8,1)\nnon-conserving matrix element of O2\n(corresponding to the insertion of this operator at a fixed time,\nsee below), and the above consideration does not apply.\n2\nThe factor (MK\n\u2212 M\u03c02 ) on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) originates from the CPS symmetry of the\noperator (c.f. Eq. (2)), while the quantity in the square brackets is determined by the kinematics. This\nlatter quantity indeed diverges in the limit MK \u2192 M\u03c0 (and \u01eb \u2192 0). That this is exactly what one expects\nto happen follows because the K\u0304 0 propagator in Fig. 1(b) goes on-shell without being amputated. In\nfact, Fig. 1(b) also represents the process of K 0 -K\u0304 0 scattering into \u03c0 + -\u03c0 \u2212 , but in that case in order to\nobtain a finite amplitude, the LSZ reduction formula tells us to amputate the K\u0304 0 external leg, before\nputting it on-shell. Since in our case this leg is not amputated, the diagram is divergent in the on-shell\nlimit. In the case that K 0 , \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 are all at rest, this \"K\u0304 0 on-shell\" point coincides with the limit\nMK \u2192 M\u03c0 , and CPS symmetry prevents the divergence from happening: the amplitude actually vanishes\nat MK = M\u03c0 .\n\nHowever, one may consider the following more general situation. Consider for instance kinematics\nwith K 0 at rest but \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 carrying\nspatial momenta p~ and \u2212~\np respectively. In that case, the \"K\u0304 0\np\n2\n2\np| , and diagram 1(b) is proportional to p~2 /\u01eb at this point.\non-shell\" point is at MK = E\u03c0 = M\u03c0 + |~\n2\n2\nThe extra factor (MK \u2212 M\u03c0 ) clearly does not help in this case, and the divergence occurs of course for\nexactly the same reason as described above.\nWe gain more insight by considering the amplitude in position space, as in Fig. 2(b). This diagram\ncontains a factor e\u2212iMK |tw \u2212ts | from the K\u0304 0 propagator, where tw is the location (in time) of the weak\n(8,1)\noperator O2\n(taken as tw = 0 in the diagram), and ts is the location of the strong vertex.

The dashed line in\n(b) means K\u0304 0 could be off-shell, while all the other mesons are always on-shell. The weak operator is at\nthe space-time origin. K 0 is created at tK (\u03c4K ), and the pions are annihilated at t\u03c0 (\u03c4\u03c0 ) in Minkowski\n(Euclidean) space.\nprescription for this K\u0304 0 line corresponds to taking a Fourier transform with respect to tw , and putting\nthe corresponding momentum on-shell. For this to work, the integral over tw needs to be regulated\nby replacing MK \u2192 MK \u2212 i\u01eb, and this is precisely what leads to the i\u01eb prescription in Eq. (3). It\nfollows that the divergence encountered here is regulated by considering the amplitude at finite tw (by\ntime-translation invariance we may choose tw = 0). This is of course what one does anyway in a lattice\ncomputation of this amplitude. It is therefore instructive to consider this amplitude in position space\nrather than momentum space [6], which is what we will do next.\nSince we take all our mesons to have vanishing spatial momentum, we will consider the relevant\ncorrelators in the time-momentum representation, i.e. study the correlators\nas functions of 3-momentum\np\nand time. In this setup, a free meson propagator with energy Ep~ = m2 + |~\np|2 (m is the mass and p~ is\nthe 3-momentum of the meson) is\ne\u2212iEp~ |t|\n,\n2Ep~\n\n(Minkowski)\n\ne\u2212Ep~|\u03c4 |\n,\n2Ep~\n\n(Euclidean)\n\nwhere t (\u03c4 ) is the Minkowski (Euclidean) time. The time dependence of the Minkowski expression is of\ncourse in accordance with the i\u01eb prescription of Eq. (3). We now consider the Minkowski correlator,\nC2\n\n=\n\n(8,1)\n\n(0)K~00 (tK )|0i,\n\n(5)\n\n(8,1)\n\n(0)K~00 (\u03c4K )|0i.\n\n(6)\n\nh0|\u03c0~0+ (t\u03c0 )\u03c0~0\u2212 (t\u03c0 )O2\n\nand its Euclidean counterpart,\nC2\n\n= h0|\u03c0~0+ (\u03c4\u03c0 )\u03c0~0\u2212 (\u03c4\u03c0 )O2\n3\n\n\fFor simplicity, we choose to annihilate the two pions at the same time, and assume that tK (\u03c4K ) < 0\nand t\u03c0 (\u03c4\u03c0 ) > 0. The weak operator is inserted at time tw = 0 (\u03c4w = 0). All particles are at rest (as\nindicated by the subscripts ~0). The relevant diagrams for the above correlators are shown in Fig. 2. In\nthe following, we only present the result in Minkowski space, but stress that the calculation in Euclidean\nspace is virtually identical, and leads to the same conclusion [6].\nThe contribution from diagram 2(a) to the correlator C2 is:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001 e\u2212iMK |tK | e\u22122iM\u03c0 t\u03c0\n\u22128i\u03b12\n2\n2\nC2(a) =\n,\nM\n\u2212\nM\nK\n\u03c0\n3f 3\n(2MK )(2M\u03c0 )(2M\u03c0 )\n\n(7)\n\nwhile diagram 2(b) leads to\nC2(b)\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n4i\u03b12\ni\n2\nMK\n\u2212 M\u03c02\n3\n3f\n(2MK )(2MK )(2M\u03c0 )(2M\u03c0 )\nZ\n\u00d7 dts e\u2212iMK |ts \u2212tK | e\u2212iMK |ts | e\u22122iM\u03c0 |t\u03c0 \u2212ts |\n\b 2\n\u00d7 MK\n[1 + \u01eb(ts )\u01eb(ts \u2212 tK )] + MK M\u03c0 [\u01eb(ts ) + \u01eb(ts \u2212 tK )] \u01eb(t\u03c0 \u2212 ts ) + 2M\u03c02 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere ts is the time-component of the space-time position of the strong chiral Lagrangian vertex in this\ndiagram. The function \u01eb(t) is defined as:\n(\n+1, t > 0.\n\u01eb(t) =\n(9)\n\u22121, t < 0.\nIn the above two equations, only the integral of ts between 0 and t\u03c0 can result in a \"vanishing denominator\" when MK \u2192 M\u03c0 . Explicitly, it is:\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nMK + M\u03c02 + MK M\u03c0\nC2(b) |0\u2192t\u03c0 = \u2212i C2(a) \u00d7\n2MK\n\u001a\ni\u001b\nh\n1\n(10)\ne\u22122i(MK \u2212M\u03c0 )t\u03c0 \u2212 1 .\n\u00d7\n\u22122i(MK \u2212 M\u03c0 )\n\nWhen MK \u2192 M\u03c0 , the factor\n\n1\n\u22122i(MK \u2212 M\u03c0 )\n\ni\nh\ne\u22122i(MK \u2212M\u03c0 )t\u03c0 \u2212 1\n\nis just t\u03c0 . Therefore, for finite t\u03c0 (or finite \u03c4\u03c0 in Euclidean space), C2 (or C2 in Euclidean space) vanishes\n2\nat MK = M\u03c0 (with both C2(a) = 0 and C2(b) = 0 separately) due to the explicit factor of MK\n\u2212 M\u03c02 , and\nthere is no power divergence. This conclusion remains true to all orders in \u03c7PT.\nTo conclude, we would like to discuss in some more detail why the factor linear in t\u03c0 appears in Eq.\n(10), even though C2(b) vanishes for MK = M\u03c0 because of the explicit factor (ms \u2212 md ) in Eq. (2).\nOmitting this factor, our result contains a term linear in t\u03c0 for MK = M\u03c0 . One would expect that if one\ntakes t\u03c0 large after taking the limit MK \u2192 M\u03c0 , it would be necessary to unitarize C2(b) .2 Re-interpreting\ndiagram 2(b) as the lowest-order contribution in \u03c7P T (in the strong vertex) to K 0 K\u0304 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 scattering\n(as we did above), the term linear in t\u03c0 can be understood as follows. For MK = M\u03c0 , there is full SU (3)\nsymmetry, and |KKi and |\u03c0\u03c0i s-wave, I = 0 states can be expressed in terms of the (I = 0 components\nof the) irreducible states |1i, |8i and |27i through the relations [9]\nr\n1\n1\n1 3\n|1i = \u221a |KKi + \u221a |\u03b7\u03b7i +\n|\u03c0\u03c0i,\n2 2\n2\n2 2\nr\n3\n1\n1\n|\u03c0\u03c0i,\n|8i = \u221a |KKi + \u221a |\u03b7\u03b7i \u2212\n5\n5\n5\nr\nr\n1\n3\n27\n|27i = \u2212\n|KKi +\n|\u03b7\u03b7i + \u221a |\u03c0\u03c0i,\n(11)\n10\n40\n40\n2 The on-shell divergence discussed earlier has nothing to do with this term linear in t , but, as explained above, with\n\u03c0\nthe oscillatory behavior of e\u2212iMK |tw \u2212ts | .\n\n4\n\n\fwhere\n|KKi =\n|\u03c0\u03c0i\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u221a |K 0 K\u0304 0 i + |K + K \u2212 i ,\n2\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1 \u0010 0 0\n\u221a |\u03c0 \u03c0 i + 2|\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 i .\n3\n\n(12)\n\nFrom these relations, it follows that\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3\n3\n3\nh\u03c0\u03c0(t = t\u03c0 )|KK(t = 0)i =\nh1(t = t\u03c0 )|1(t = 0)i \u2212\nh8(t = t\u03c0 )|8(t = 0)i \u2212\nh27(t = t\u03c0 )|27(t = 0)i.\n4\n5\n20\n(13)\nTo leading order in \u03c7P T this expression contains a term linear in t\u03c0 , the coefficient of which is the\ncorresponding linear combination of finite-volume two-particle energy shifts, thus explaining how a term\nlinear in t\u03c0 appears in C2(b) . Note that the normalization of C2(b) has been chosen such that (in leading\nnon-vanishing order) it is independent of the spatial volume. Higher orders in \u03c7P T will indeed unitarize\nour result.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Claude Bernard, Chris Dawson, Jack Laiho, Yigal Shamir, Steve Sharpe, Amarjit Soni\nand Giovanni Villadoro for helpful discussions.
