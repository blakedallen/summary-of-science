Following a recent proposal [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 98, 150404 (2007)], we present an experimental demonstration of the fractional statistics\nof anyons in the Kitaev spin lattice model using a photonic quantum simulator. We dynamically\ncreate the ground state and excited states (which are six-qubit graph states) of the Kitaev model\nHamiltonian, and implement the anyonic braiding and fusion operations by single-qubit rotations. A\nphase shift of \u03c0 related to the anyon braiding is observed, confirming the prediction of the fractional\nstatistics of Abelian 1/2-anyons.\n\nQuantum statistics classifies fundamental particles in\nthree dimensions as bosons and fermions. Interestingly,\nin two dimensions the laws of physics permit the existence\nof exotic quasiparticles-anyons-which obey a new statistical behavior, called fractional or braiding statistics\n[1]. That is, upon exchange of two such particles, the system wave function will acquire a statistical phase which\ncan take any value-hence this name. Anyons have been\npredicted to live as excitations in fractional quantum Hall\n(FQH) systems [2, 3, 4]. Alternatively, quantum states\nwith anyonic excitations can be artificially designed in\nspin model systems that possess highly nontrivial ground\nstates with topological order. A prominent example is the\nKitaev spin lattice model [5, 6], which opened the avenue\nof fault-tolerant topological quantum computing [7, 8].\nIt is an important goal to manipulate the anyons and\ndemonstrate their exotic statistics. Towards this goal,\na number of theoretical schemes have been proposed,\nboth in the FQH regime [9] and in the Kitaev models\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. However, it has proved extremely difficult to experimentally detect the fractional statistics associated with anyon braiding. While recent experiments\nin the FQH systems have indeed revealed some signatures of anyonic statistics [15, 16], resolving individual\nanyons remains elusive [7]. Here we take a different approach to this challenge - exploiting the spin models to\nstudy the anyonic statistics. Following a recent proposal\n[14], we demonstrate the fractional statistics of anyons\nby simulation of the Kitaev model on a six-photon graph\nstate. The method is to dynamically create the ground\nstate and excited state of the anyonic model Hamiltonian, and implement the braiding and fusion operations\nby single-qubit rotations.\nHow can the statistical nature of elementary particles\nbe experimental observable? First let us recall the concept of quantum statistics. The wave function of a twoparticle system \u03c8(r1 , r2 ) will acquire a statistical phase\n\n\u03b8 upon an adiabatic exchange of two particles, that is,\n\u03c8(r2 , r1 ) = ei\u03b8 \u03c8(r1 , r2 ), where \u03b8 = 0 for bosons, \u03b8 = \u03c0\nfor fermions, and \u03b8 can be any value (0 6 \u03b8 6 \u03c0) for\nanyons. It can be seen that a full circulation of a particle\naround the other one is equivalent to two successive particle exchanges [8]. After such a circulation, both bosons\nand fermions show a trivial phase (\u03c6 = 2\u03b8 = 0, 2\u03c0), but\nanyons will get an observable non-trivial phase \u03c6. To realize this idea, we need a system where anyons can be\ncreated and braiding operations can be carried out experimentally. The Kitaev model is well suited for this.\nThe first Kitaev model was designed on a spin lattice\nwith qubits living on the edges (see Fig. 1a). For each\nvertex v and face f , we consider operators of the form\nY\nY\nZj ,\n(1)\nX j , Bf =\nAv =\nj\u2208boundary(f )\n\nj\u2208star(v)\n\nwhere X (Z) denotes the standard Pauli matrix \u03c3x (\u03c3z ).\nThese operators Av , Bf are put together to make up the\nmodel Hamiltonian\nX\nX\nH = \u2212\nAv \u2212\nBf .\n(2)\nv\n\nf\n\nThe ground state |\u03c8g i of this Hamiltonian (2) is given\nby Av |\u03c8g i = |\u03c8g i and Bf |\u03c8g i = |\u03c8g i for all vertices\nand faces. Violations of these conditions cost energy and\ngenerate excited states |\u03c8e i. A quasiparticle is created\non the vertex vi (face fi ) if Avi (Bfi ) acting on the excited state |\u03c8e i, yields an eigenvalue \u22121 instead of +1\nfor the ground state. In Ref. [5, 14], the quasiparticles\non vertices are called \"electric charges\" (e-particles for\nshort) and those on faces are called \"magnetic vortices\"\n(m-particles). It is shown that these particles have unusual mutual statistical properties, as we can get a phase\nflip \u22121 if we move one particle around the other, which\nare thus called abelian 1/2-anyons [5] (see Fig. 1b).\n\n\f2\n\na\n\nb\n\nf\n\n1\n\nm\n\nf1\nm\n\nb\n\n2\n\nv1\n\n2\n\nH\n\nz\n\nx\n\nv\n\na\n\ne z\n\n4\n\nz\ne\n\nx\n\nv2\n\nf2\n\n1\n\n5\n\n3\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n3\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: The first Kitaev model [5] and anyonic braiding operations [14]. (a). In this spin lattice, the qubits live on the\nedges and the stabilizer operators Av , Bf (1) represent the\nfour-body interactions as illustrated. (b). Creation of quasiparticles and braid of an m-particle around an e-particle. A\npair of e-particles (m-particles) are created on vertices (faces)\nby applying a Z (X) operation on the edge qubit. The quasiparticles can be moved horizontally and vertically by repeated\napplications of Z or X operations. The figure shows an example of how an m-particle forms a closed loop around an\ne-particle through a series of moves.\n\nRecently, Han, Raussendorf and Duan [14] exploited\nthe fact that the statistical properties of anyons are manifested by the underlying ground and excited states [17].\nSo, instead of direct engineering the interactions of the\nHamiltonian H (2) and ground-state cooling which are\nextremely demanding experimentally, an easier way is\nto dynamically create the ground state and the excitations of this model Hamiltonian, encoding the underlying\nanyonic model in a multiparticle entangled state which\ncan used to simulate the dynamics of the anyonic system. The quasiparticles are then defined by the negative outcome of a stabilizer element Av or Bf . Specificaly, as illustrated in Fig. 1b, with the ground state\n|\u03c8g i prepared, one can first create a pair of e-particles\nby applying a single-qubit Z rotation. The system wave\nfunction will be in the excited state |\u03c8e i. To make fractional phase \u221aexperimentally detectable in a later stage,\nwe \u221a\napply a Z rotation and get a superposition state\n(1/ 2)(|\u03c8g i + |\u03c8e i). Then we create another pair of mparticles and move one of them around an e-particle along\na closed loop, and finally annihilate the m-particles. After doing so, it is predicted that a fractional phase \u03c0\nwill be added\n\u221a to |\u03c8e i, thus the superposition state will\nbecome (1/ 2)(|\u03c8g i \u2212 |\u03c8e i).\nAs the anyons are perfectly localized quasiparticles in\nthis model Hamiltonian, a small spin lattice containing\nsix qubits shown in Fig. 2a allows for a proof-of-principle\nexperimental demonstration [5, 14]. The Hamiltonian of\nthis model is H6 = \u2212A1 \u2212 A2 \u2212 B1 \u2212 B2 \u2212 B3 \u2212 B4 ,\nwhere A1 = X1 X2 X3 , A2 = X3 X4 X5 X6 , B1 = Z1 Z3 Z4 ,\nB2 = Z2 Z3 Z5 , B3 = Z4 Z6 , B4 = Z5 Z6 (the subscripts of\nthe Pauli matrices label the qubits).

The small Kitaev spin lattice system with six\nqubits used for demonstration of anyonic braiding operations.\n(b). The six-qubit graph state which, after Hadamard (H)\ntransformations on qubit 2, 3, 4, and 5, is equivalent to the\nground state of the system in Fig. 2a. The graph state is\nassociated with a graph, \u221a\nwhere each vertex denotes a qubit\nprepared in the state (1/ 2)(|0i + |1i) and each edge represents a controlled phase gate having been applied between the\ntwo connected qubits [18, 19]. The graph state is a common\neigenstate of the stabilizer operators gi , that is, gi |\u03c8i6 = |\u03c8i6 ,\nwhich describe the correlation in the state, and the graph\nstate is the unique state fulfilling this. Here we use the same\nlabel as Fig. 2a-b in ref. [14]. (c). Experimental set-up for the\ngeneration of graph state and demonstration of braiding operations. A pulsed ultraviolet laser successively passes through\nthree \u03b2-barium borate (BBO) crystals to generate three pairs\nof entangled photons [20]. The photons a, b, c, d, and f are\ncombined on the three polarizing beam splitters (PBSs) step\nby step [21]. To achieve good spatial and temporal overlap, all\nphotons are spectrally filtered (\u2206\u03bbFWHW = 3.2nm) and detected by fiber-coupled single-photon detectors (D1 , * * * , D6 ).\nThe detector labels correspond to the qubit labels in the text\nand in Fig. 2a-b. The coincidence events are registered by\na programmable multichannel coincidence unit. For singlequbit rotations and polarization analysis, quarter wave plates\n(QWPs), half wave plates (HWPs), together with polarizers\nor PBSs are used.\n\nsix-qubit graph state [18, 19], which can be represented\nby the graph as depicted in Fig. 2b. This equivalence\nfollows from the fact that the operators A1 , * * * , B4 in the\nKitaev model can be uniquely derived from the stabilizer\noperators gi (see Fig. 2b) of the graph state.\nNow we proceed with the experiment in three steps:\n(1) create and analyze of the ground state |\u03c8i6 , (2) verify the anyonic excitations, (3) implement the braiding\n\n\f3\n\n|\u03c8i6 =\n\n1\n(|Hi1 |Hi2 |Hi3 |Hi4 |Hi5 |Hi6\n2\n+ |V i1 |V i2 |V i3 |Hi4 |Hi5 |Hi6\n+ |Hi1 |Hi2 |V i3 |V i4 |V i5 |V i6\n+ |V i1 |V i2 |Hi3 |V i4 |V i5 |V i6 ).\n\na\n\n1\n\n2\n\nGround state\n\nb\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n6\n\nExcited state\n\n2\n\ne\n0.8\n\n3\n4\n\nExpectation value\n\noperations and detect the anyonic phase.

The photons in\nspatial modes\u221aa-b and e-f are prepared in the states\n|\u03c6+ iij = (1/ 2)(|Hii |Hij + |V ii |V ij ), while those in\nmode c-d are disentangled using\u221apolarizers and then prepared in the states |+ii = (1/ 2)(|Hii + |V ii ), where\nH(V ) denotes horizontal (vertical) polarization, and i\nand j label the spatial modes. We then pass the photons\nthrough a linear optics network (see Fig. 3c).

Each expectation value is\nderived from a complete set of 64 six-fold coincidence events\nin 15h in measurement basis Z \u22976 or X \u22976 . The error bars\nrepresent one standard deviation, deduced from propagated\nPoissonian statistics of the raw detection events.\n\n(3)\n\nTo verify that the ground state |\u03c8i6 has been obtained,\nfirst we experimentally measure the expectation values\nof its stabilizer operators A1 , * * * , B4 . These stabilizer\noperators describe the intrinsic correlations in the state\n|\u03c8i6 and uniquely define it, thus their expectation values could serve as a good experimental signature. For an\nideal state |\u03c8i6 , all expectation values should give +1.\nIn our experiment however, the ground state was created\nimperfectly. Figure 3a shows the measurement results,\nwith all expectation values being positive in a rang between 0.51\u00b10.04 and 0.74\u00b10.03, in qualitative agreement\nwith the theoretical prediction. For a more complete\nand quantitative analysis, we aim to estimate the fidelity\nof the produced state, that is, its overlap with the desired one. This quantity is given by F\u03c86 = 6 h\u03c8|\u03c1exp |\u03c8i6 ,\nwhich is equal to one for an ideal state, and 1/64 for a\ncompletely mixed six-qubit state. To do so, we consider\na special observable, which allows for lower bounds on\nthe fidelity, while being easily measurable with few correlation measurements [22, 23]. By making these measurements, we estimate the fidelity of the created ground\nstate to be F\u03c86 > 0.532 \u00b1 0.041 [24]. The imperfection\nof this state is mainly caused by the high-order photon\nemissions during the SPDC and the partial distinguishability of independent photons [25].\nWe now move to the step (2). With the ground state\n|\u03c8i6 created, we apply a Z (X) rotation on qubit 3 (4),\ncreating an excited state |\u03c8em i6 on which a pair of eparticles live on the vertices v1 and v2 , and another pair\nof m-particles on faces f1 and f3 (see Fig. 2a). The Z\nand X rotations are experimentally realized using HWPs\noriented at 0\u25e6 and 45\u25e6 , respectively. As discussed be-\n\nfore, the anyonic excitations are signaled by violations\nof stabilizer conditions, that is, Avi |\u03c8em i6 = \u2212|\u03c8em i6 ,\nBfi |\u03c8em i6 = \u2212|\u03c8em i6 [5]. Thus in our case, theoretically,\nthe expectation values of A1 and A2 should become \u22121\nbecause of the e-particles, and the same for B1 and B3\ndue to the m-particles. To verify this, we measure the\nexpectation values of the operators A1 ,* * * ,B4 . The results are shown in Fig. 3b, where the values of A1 , A2 ,\nB1 and B3 flip compared to those shown in Fig. 3a which\nsupports the presence of anyonic excitations [5, 14].\nNow we proceed to the\n\u221a step (3). On the ground state\n|\u03c8i6 , first we apply a Z operation using a QWP oriented at 0\u25e6 on the qubit 3 of the ground\n\u221a state |\u03c8i6 , yielding a superposition state |\u03c8s i6 = (1/ 2)(|\u03c8i6 + |\u03c8e i6 ),\nwhere |\u03c8e i6 is the excited state with a pair of e-particles\non v1 and v2 . With an X rotation on the qubit 4 we further create a pair of m-particles on f1 and f3 . Then we\nperform four X operations on the qubits 6-5-3-4 to implement the braiding operation, that is, the m-particle on f3\nis moved around the e-particle on v2 along an anticlockwise closed loop. We note that the crossing at the qubit\n3, which is unavoidable in two dimensions, is relevant for\nthe unusual statistics. Finally, the pair of m-particles is\nannihilated with an X operation on qubit 4 (fusion).\nAfter these, if there is a fractional \u221a\nphase \u03c6 acquired, the\nstate |\u03c8s i6 will become |\u03c8f i6 = (1/ 2)(|\u03c8i6 + ei\u03c6 |\u03c8e i6 ).\nTo determine this \u03c6, we look at the correlation measurement outcomes of the six photons where the photons 1 and 2 are fixed at |+i polarization, 4, 5 and\n6 at |Hi and the photon 3 is measured in the basis\n(|+i + ei\u03b1 |\u2212i) with \u03b1 varying in \u03c0/4 steps. In this setting, the six-fold coincidence counts should follow the\nrelation C(\u03c6, \u03b1) \u221d 1 + sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b1) for the state |\u03c8f i6 , thus\n\n\f4\n\nb\n\n80\n\nBefore braiding\nAfter braiding\n0.8\n\nExpectation value\n\nSixfold coincidence (20 hours)\n\na\n\n60\n40\n20\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n90\n\n180\n\nAngle of\n\n270\n\n(degree)\n\n360\n\n0.0\nX1X2X3\nX3X4X5X6\nZ1Z3Z4\nZ2Z3Z5\nZ4Z6\nZ5Z6\n\nA\n\nA1\n1\n\nA\nB1 B\nB2 B\nA2 B\nB3 B\nB4\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 4: (a). Measured fringes for the state |\u03c8s i6 and |\u03c8f i6 .\nThe measurements in basis (|+i + ei\u03b1 |\u2212i) are done using a\ncombination of HWPs, QWP and PBS. (b). The expectation\nvalues\nof the operators A1 , * * * , B4 of the state |\u03c8f i6 after the\n\u221a\nZ3 transformation.\n\nan unknown phase \u03c6, if occurs, can be revealed. Figure 4a shows the measurement results for both the state\n|\u03c8s i6 and |\u03c8f i6 , before and after the process of m-particle\ncreation, braiding and fusion. These two curves clearly\nexhibit a phase difference of \u03c0, confirming the prediction\nof the fractional statistics.\n\u221a\nFor a more complete proof, we implement a Z transformation on the qubit 3 of the remaining state |\u03c8f i6 .\nThe state |\u03c8f i6 will be converted to |\u03c8i6 if there is a fractional phase \u03c0, otherwise it will go to |\u03c8e i6 . To test this,\nagain we measure the expectation \u221a\nvalues of the operators A1 ,* * * ,B4 of the state after the Z3 transformation.\nThe experimental results are shown in Fig. 4b, which are\nin agreement with that the final state is |\u03c8i6 and thus\nprove the fractional phase change of \u03c6 = \u03c0. Here we note\nthat the facts that the present setup use free-flying noninteracting photons and that the timescale of the braiding\noperations is extremely small (\u223c picoseconds for photons\npassing through the HWPs and QWPs) implies that this\nacquired phase cannot be a dynamical phase. Moreover,\nthe creating, braiding and annihilating of the m-particles\nwhich corresponds to the operation X4 X6 X5 X3 do not\ngive rise to a phase either, as the ground state |\u03c8i6 is an\neigenstate of this observable X4 X6 X5 X3 . Similar arguments also apply to the e-particles' case. Consequently,\nthis excludes possible geometrical phases [26] and proves\nthe observed phase is purely statistical.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the creation and\nmanipulation of anyons in the Kitaev spin lattice model,\nand observed the fractional statistics of the abelian 1/2anyons. This has been done without generating the fourbody interactions in the model Hamiltonian but alternatively, in an easier way-by encoding the underlying anyonic system on a six-photon graph state, or equivalently,\nrealizing the six-qubit circuit shown in Fig. 2c of ref.\n[14]. It should be noted that the absence of the Hamiltonian does not prevent us from studying the topological\nand statistical properties of the anyons here; however,\n\ntopological quantum computing in a fault-tolerant manner would eventually require such a Hamiltonian. From\na quantum-information prospective, our experiment may\nbe seen as using quantum computers which have already\nwell understood physics as a tool to simulate other difficult quantum systems. Such quantum simulators can in\nprinciple provide exponential speedup in the simulation\nof quantum physics [27], and may offer a more controllable and clean access to study strongly correlated behaviors than natural complex solid-state systems. Possible\nfuture work along this line may include investigation of\nthe robustness of anyonic braiding [14] and other possible phases [26] using hyper-entangled graph states [28],\nand demonstration of some basic elements of cluster-state\ntopological quantum computing [29].\nAcknowledgements: We thank R.
