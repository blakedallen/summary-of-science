Introduction\nThe techniques of lattice gauge theory offer the\npossibility of accurate, non-perturbative calculation of the masses and matrix elements predicted\nby low-energy QCD. Of particular interest are the\nproperties of the K-meson system and the lowenergy, weak matrix elements that are required to\nunderstand Kaon decays, especially those which\nenter the K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes which violate\nCP symmetry. Presently well-developed methods permit the calculation of K to vacuum and\nK to \u03c0 weak matrix elements. When combined\nwith chiral perturbation theory and the accurate\nchiral symmetry of the domain wall fermion formulation, lattice methods can be used to evaluate all the matrix elements that contribute to the\nweak K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes in the chiral limit[1,2].\nIn this paper we describe a method which may\nprovide a practical approach to the direct lattice\ncalculation of the desired, on-shell, K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes without the use of chiral perturbation\ntheory.\n2. Finite volume decay amplitudes\nWe begin by reviewing the finite-volume approach developed by Lellouch and L\u00fcscher. To\ncompute the matrix element of an operator O between two physical states |Ai and |Bi, one typically evaluates the Euclidean Green's function:\no\nn\nG(t1 , t2 , t3 ) = Tr B(t1 )O(t2 )A(t3 )e\u2212HT\n\u2217 Presented\n\nby C. Kim. This work was supported by in\npart by the U. S. Department of Energy.\n\nin the limit T \u226b t1 \u226b t2 \u226b t3 . Here the operators A and B are chosen to carry quantum\nnumbers which insure that the desired states, |Ai\nand |Bi are each the lowest energy states that can\nbe created from the vacuum by A and B, respectively. As demonstrated by Maiani and Testa[3],\nthis method fails when one of the desired states is\na two-particle state above threshold. In this case\nthe desired final state cannot be uniquely selected\nby its quantum numbers and the Euclidean time\nlimit will give an unwanted, threshold amplitude.\nIn a recent paper[4], Lellouch and L\u00fcscher propose a method to circumvent this difficulty by\ntuning the finite lattice volume so that the first\nexcited two-particle state allowed in that volume\nhas the energy of the initial decaying particle.\nThey work out an explicit formula which relates\nthe resulting finite-volume matrix element to the\ndesired infinite volume decay amplitude. The\nsame result is obtained by different methods by\nLin et al., offering further insight[5]. As proposed, this method faces serious practical difficulties given our present computational capabilities.\nFirst, a large spatial volume of (6 Fermi)3 is required if the first-excited \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 state is to have\nan energy matching the Kaon mass. Second, the\nextraction of the next-leading exponential in the\nlarge-time limit is numerically difficult, especially\nif an accurate result is desired. Finally, while the\nmatrix element of the I = 2 final state can be obtained from the coefficient of such a next-leading\nexponential, the more important I = 0 state also\nreceives a vacuum contribution implying that the\ndesired amplitude is the third term in an expansion in increasingly small exponentials.\n\n\f2\nWe propose to overcome these difficulties by\nimposing an anti-periodic boundary condition on\nthe pions, say in the z-direction, while using the\nusual periodic boundary conditions in the other\ntwo directions. With this choice the lowest en\u03c0\nergy state of a single pion has momentum pz = L\ninstead of zero. With such a choice of boundary\nconditions, the lowest energy state with I = 2\n\u03c0\n.\nwill be two pions, each with momentum pz \u2248 \u00b1 L\nThus, the matrix element of such a state can be\nextracted from the leading exponential in the Euclidean Green's function. Since the vacuum state\nis unaffected by these boundary conditions, our\nI = 0 two-pion state will show the next-leading\nlarge-time behavior and a vacuum subtraction\nwill be necessary for calculation of \u2206I = 12 amplitudes.\nThe condition which insures that the two-pion\nstate has the relative momentum required for a\nphysical K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decay, now requires Lz \u2248 3\nFermi, only one-half the lattice extent needed for\nthe periodic case. The other two spatial dimensions are not constrained by these kinematics and\nmight be chosen to be similar Lx = Ly = Lz\ngiving a reduced box size of (3 Fermi)3 . Thus,\nthe proposed method decreases the required spatial size from (6 Fermi)3 to (3 Fermi)3 and promotes the amplitude of interest to one of leading\n(I = 2) or next-leading (I = 0) large-time behavior. Since only periodic and cubically symmetric periodic boundary conditions were discussed\nin the original finite volume analysis[6] on which\nthe Lellouch-L\u00fcscher paper[4] is based, we must\nrecompute L\u00fcscher's function \u03c6(k) for this new,\nless symmetrical case. This has been done without difficulty following the method presented in\nthe original paper, Ref. [6].\n3. G-parity boundary condition\nIt is not immediately obvious how to realize\nthis boundary condition for the pion, because we\nhave control only on the underlying quark fields.\nHowever, the G-parity operation gives the solution since under G-parity: G|\u03c0 >= \u2212|\u03c0 >. From\nthis, we can see that anti-periodic boundary conditions for the pion can be achieved by performing\na G-parity operation at the boundary-an oper-\n\nation that also can be defined at the quark level:\nu \u2192 d \u0304 and d \u2192 \u2212\u016b. (Recall that G is defined as\nthe product of charge-conjugation and an isospin\nrotation, G = C exp i\u03c0Iy .) These unusual boundary were originally proposed and implemented by\nWiese[7] and similar boundary conditions have\nalso been used in Ref. [8].\nSince we must also treat the Kaon, we must\nimpose a charge conjugate boundary condition on\nthe strange quark for consistency. This is easily\ndone by including a fictitious charmed quark, degenerate with the strange quark and extending\nthe usual G-parity by treating the (c, s) quark\npair as an independent iso-doublet. Our initial\nfinite volume eigenstate can then\n\u221a be constructed\nas a G-even mixture (K 0 +D0 )/ 2. However, because our weak decay operator and our final states\nhave definite strangeness and charm, this mixing\nonly\n\u221a introduces an extra \"finite-volume factor\" of\n1/ 2 which can easily be removed.\n4. Lattice Action\n4.1. Symmetry\nBy imposing this G-parity boundary condition,\nwe break chiral symmetry in a manner similar\nto the chiral symmetry breaking of a mass term.\nThis was studied for the continuum in Ref. [7].\nOn the lattice, the boundary condition is embedded in the action itself, adding a boundaryspecific term. For example, with G-parity boundary conditions we have a term in the action density of the form:\nu(Lz \u2212 1)U 3 (Lz \u2212 1)\u03b33 Cd(0)T ,\n\n(1)\n\nfor Dirac conventions in which charge conjugation\nis represented by q \u2192 Cq T . Here u(Lz \u22121) is evaluated at the site z = Lz \u2212 1 and d(0) at the site\nz = 0 while U 3 (Lz \u2212 1) is the link variable joining these two sites across the boundary. Under\nchiral SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R such a term transforms\nas a ( 12 , 12 ). While such a boundary term may\nappear to break translational invariance, the fact\nthat the lattice Lagrangian is invariant under the\nG-parity operation ensures us that the system has\ntranslational symmetry, if appropriately defined.\n(Note, when exploring unconventional boundary\nconditions it is important to preserve the conser-\n\n\f3\nvation of lattice momentum and hence to require\ntranslational invariance.)\n4.2. Implementation\nThe actual implementation of these boundary\nconditions represents a fairly minor modification\nof the usual lattice Dirac operator. An easy way\nof visualizing these G-parity boundary conditions\nbegins with doubling the lattice in the z-direction,\nwith the complex conjugates of gauge links in the\noriginal volume copied onto the links translated\nby Lz into this extended volume. One then easily defines a single-flavor Dirac operator on this\nLx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 2 * Lz lattice in the usual way, but\nimposing anti-periodic boundary conditions between the z = 0 and z = 2Lz \u2212 1 boundaries. If\na quark field in the original volume is identified\nas a u quark, then the quark field in the doubled,\nLz \u2264 z < 2Lz \u2212 1 volume would be viewed as a d\nquark. Note, the computational load is twice that\nof a usual calculation on a Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Lz volume-\nour boundary conditions have effectively required\nseparate treatment for the u and d quarks. Such\nan approach works for both Wilson and domain\nwall fermions.\n5. Conclusion\nSince the G-parity boundary condition is imposed in only one direction, we lose cubic symmetry. In the cubically symmetric case the state\nof interest with orbital angular momenta l = 0 is\nmixed only with states having l differing by multiples of 4. However, without this cubic symmetry only parity invariance remains which permits\nmixing with all even l. Thus, in the practical\napplication of the Lellouch and L\u00fcscher method\nwhere the mixed, higher-l states are treated as\nfree and their phase shifts ignored, we must neglect the l = 2 phase shift \u03b42 (mK ). This reduces\nthe accuracy of this approximation, introducing\nerrors of order (R/L)4 rather than (R/L)8 as is\nthe case for cubic symmetry[6]. Here R is a typical strong interaction distance, e.g. R = 1/m\u03c1 .\nThere is an additional complexity for the I = 0\nfinal state that should be discussed. For simplicity, we consider a full QCD calculation which includes only dynamical u and d quarks. For such a\n\nsystem, in addition to the three pions, there will\nbe a fourth SU (2) singlet, quark-anti-quark state\ncalled here the \u03b7 \u2032 . This \u03b7 \u2032 state is G-parity even\nin contrast to G-parity odd triplet of pions and\nhence will obey even boundary conditions. Thus\nan intended two-pion, I = 0 state may mix with\nan unwanted, threshold two-\u03b7 \u2032 state which will\nhave the same quantum numbers. Fortunately,\nin the two-flavor calculation just described, axial anomaly effects are expected make the nonGoldstone \u03b7 \u2032 heavier than the physical Kaon so\nthis two-\u03b7 \u2032 state will play no role. However, in\na quenched calculation, this two-\u03b7 \u2032 state will be\nessentially degenerate with the desired I = 0 twopion state and obstruct the calculation. In fact,\nthe hairpin diagrams entering the quenched two\u03b7 \u2032 amplitudes will give an extra power of t or t2\nfurther obscuring the state of interest. Thus, this\nG-parity boundary condition can be used in the\nquenched approximation only for the evaluation\nof \u2206I = 3/2 amplitudes.\nIn summary, we propose imposing anti-periodic\nboundary conditions on the pion by implementing a G-parity operation at boundary. This\nreduces the required simulation volume to \u2248\n(3 Fermi)3 and, more importantly, allows the\nphysical h\u03c0\u03c0(I)|Kweak |Ki amplitude to be extracted from the leading/next-leading large-time\nbehavior of a Euclidean correlation function for\nthe I = 2/I = 0 final states. We hope to try a\ncalculation according to this method in the coming year and thank our colleagues in the RBC collaboration for useful suggestions and criticisms.\nREFERENCES\n1. J. I.
