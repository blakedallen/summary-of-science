For baryons this change has been verified in \u03b3A reactions where the total photon\nabsorption cross section [1] shows a nontrivial dependence on the mass of the target nucleus.\nThis nontrivial dependence has been interpreted as a change of the properties of the nuclear\n\n\f2\nresonances in matter [2]. It is, however, difficult to asses whether the observed in-medium\nmodifications have to be attributed to a change of the resonance properties or to a change of\nthose of their decay products. Coupled channel calculations provide a mean to answer this\nquestion but presently neither the data are sufficiently precise nor the theoretical ingredients\ncan be sufficiently well determined in order to allow for firm conclusions even if for some\nhadrons like the \u03c1 [3] and K [4] mesons a lot of progress has been made recently.\nThe strategy is different for both cases. The study of the strange mesons takes advantage\nof the fact that they have to be produced in a heavy ion reaction, that each strange hadron is\naccompanied by an anti-strange one and that the production cross sections are phase space\ndominated. Systematic studies of the excitation function and of the system size dependence\nof the yields as well as of the modification of the measured K meson spectra as compared to\nthat measured in pp collisions allow for conclusions on the interaction of the K's with the\nenvironment [5].\nThe \u03c1 meson can decay into a dilepton pair which - being an electromagnetic probe\n- does not interact anymore with the nuclear environment. Therefore this dilepton pair\ncarries direct information on the particle at the time point of its decay in the medium.\nThe problem is that many resonances and mesons contribute to the dilepton yield and it is\nall but easy to determine which particle is at the origin of the dilepton pair. In order to\ncompare data with theory, one has to identify all dilepton sources and their contribution to\nthe dilepton spectra. This superposition of the different sources is called cocktail plot. If it\ndeviates from experiment at least one of the sources is not correctly described and one may\nstart to test how this source is modified by the hadronic environment.\nIt was the DLS collaboration which first presented dilepton invariant mass spectra in\nheavy ion collisions at beam energies of around 1 AGeV [6]. The systematic errors of these\nexploratory experiments have been, however, too large to allow for a detailed conclusion\non the behavior of hadrons in matter. Later, at higher (SPS) energies, the CERES/NA45\ncollaboration [7] presented spectra, which were not in agreement with the standard cocktail\nplots. Two theoretical models have been advanced to explain this difference. Rapp et al. [3]\ncalculated the in medium modification of the spectral function of the \u03c1 in hadronic matter.\nWith this in-medium change of the spectral function the theoretical and experimental yields\nagree. As Eletsky et al. [8] explained \u03c1 - meson and \u03c1 - baryon interactions compensate\neach other as far as the shift of the pole mass is concerned but collisions broaden the\n\n\f3\nwidth considerably. Gallmeister et al. [9] showed on the other side that the discrepancy\ndisappears as well if one adds to the spectrum the emission of the dileptons from a thermal\nq q\u0304 (or hadron-hadron) annihilation using lowest order QCD calculations.\nMost recently the NA60 collaboration measured very precisely the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons in the \u03c1 mass region [10] but it is still debated whether the discrepancy\nbetween cocktail plot and data is due to a modification of hadronic properties or due to\nannihilation processes. Additional information may be obtained from the pt spectra [11]\nbecause each emission source shows a specific transverse momentum pattern. However, consensus about the relative importance of the different possible production mechanism has not\nbeen obtained yet.\nTo clarify this question it is necessary to study the dilepton production at lower energies\nwhere quarks remain bound in hadrons and hadron hadron annihilations are rare. Then the\nprocess proposed by Gallmeister is absent and thermal production does not play a decisive\nrole. In addition one has to investigate small systems where direct collisions dominate over\nthe production in the participant heat bath.\nRecently the HADES collaboration has published the dilepton invariant mass spectrum\nfor the reaction C + C at 2 AGeV [12]. This system is small and at this energy the formation\nof a quark phase is beyond reach as the analysis of many other observables has shown. It may\ntherefore serve to solve the question of how the \u03c1 meson changes in a hadronic environment\nprovided that it can be proven that all the other ingredients of the cocktail plot are well\nunder control.\nIt is the purpose of this article to investigate in detail the dilepton invariant mass spectra\nusing one of the presently available programs which simulate heavy ion reactions on an event\nby event basis, the Isospin Quantum Molecular dynamics (IQMD) approach. The main\nobjective is to find out whether the present dilepton data are sufficiently precise to allow\nfor conclusions on the theoretically predicted change of the particle properties in a nuclear\nenvironment or to identify the obstacles on the way to achieve this goal. We concentrate in\nthis exploratory study on the most significant modifications: mass shifts and changes of the\ndecay width.\nBefore we present the results of our simulations we start out with a short presentation\nof the model and a discussion of our present theoretical and experimental knowledge on\nall the elementary processes which contribute to the dilepton spectra and of how they are\n\n\f4\nimplemented in our simulation program.\n\nII.\n\nTHE IQMD MODEL\n\nThe semi-classical IQMD program [13] simulates heavy ion reactions on a event by event\nbasis and is one of the standard analyzing tools for heavy ion reactions at and below 2\nAGeV. In this program hadrons interact by potentials and by collisions. The former ones\nare Br\u00fcckner G-matrix parameterizations for the baryons or parametrized meson-baryon\npotentials. Thus nuclei are bound objects with a binding energy following the Weizs\u00e4cker\nmass formula. If two hadrons come closer than r =\n\nq\n\n\u03c3tot /\u03c0 they collide. If several exit\n\nchannels are available a random number determines which one is realized. The relative\nweight is given by the relative cross section. The momenta and the mass (if the particles\nhave a finite width) of the hadrons in the final state are randomly determined. Their\ndistribution follows either experimental measurements or phase space, if experimental results\nare not available. In the standard version [13] of the program, nucleons as well as baryonic\nresonances, pions and kaons are the particles which are propagated.\nFor the investigation presented here we have added production cross sections of all particles which may contribute to the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons: np bremsstrahlung,\n\u03b7 Dalitz and direct decay, \u03c9 (Dalitz and direct) and \u03c1 decay, \u2206 Dalitz decay and \u03c0 0 Dalitz\ndecay. Because we concentrate on a very light system, where the probability that mesons\nhave secondary interactions is small, it has not been necessary to add the (largely unknown)\nmeson absorption or rescattering cross sections or to use off-shell transport approaches.\nWhen these particles are produced we use the branching ratios of the Particle Data Group\n[14] to determine their contribution to the dilepton spectrum.\n\nIII.\n\nELEMENTARY DILEPTON CROSS SECTIONS\n\u03c0 0 production and decay\n\nA.\n1.\n\n\u03c0 0 decay into dileptons\n\nAt low invariant mass the overwhelming number of dileptons comes from the decay of \u03c0 0\nmesons which can decay into dileptons via \u03c0 0 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03b3. The shape of the mass distribution\n\n\f5\nof a dilepton in a \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay is given by [15]:\ns\n\n1\nm2\u2212\nM2\nm2\u2212\ndN\n=\n(1 + 2 e2 )(1 \u2212 2 )3 1 \u2212 4 e2 .\ndM\nM\nM\nm\u03c00\nM\n\n(1)\n\nm\u03c00 is the mass of the \u03c00 , me\u2212 the electron mass and M that of the dilepton pair. We take\nthe branching ratio BR(\u03c0 0 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03b3) as 0.01198.\nB.\n\n\u03b7 production and decay\n\nIn the energy regime which is of interest here, the \u03b7 production in pp collisions has been\nwell studied by the TAPS [16] and the DISTO collaboration [17]. This can be seen in fig. 1\nwhich shows on top the distribution of the \u03b7 excess energies in the nucleon nucleon collisions\nfor the reaction C+C at 2 AGeV. The excess energy x\u03b7 is defined as\nx\u03b7 =\n\n\u221a\n\ns \u2212 2MN \u2212 M\u03b7 .\n\n(2)\n\nWe see that excess energies below 0.6 GeV are most relevant for this reaction. In the bottom\npart of fig. 1 we display the world data points for \u03b7 production in elementary NN collisions\n[16, 17, 18]. Whereas the cross section \u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03b7) is known over the whole excess energy\ninterval which is relevant for our investigation the \u03c3(pn \u2192 pn\u03b7) cross section is known only\nup to an excess energy of x\u03b7 = 0.12 GeV. Thus we have to extrapolate this cross section\ninto the relevant excess energy domain. This extrapolation leaves a lot of freedom even\nif the \u03b7 meson production cross section has been measured in heavy ion reactions by the\nTAPS collaboration. The reason is that in heavy ion reactions a multitude of processes may\nmodify the elementary cross section at the same nominal energy. These processes and the\nconsequences will be discussed later.

It turned out, as predicted by theory\n[21, 22], that there are essentially two channels, a direct production channel and a production\nvia the N \u2217 (1535) resonance. The direct contribution follows the three body phase space for\nthe pp \u2192 pp\u03b7 reaction. The experimental mass distribution of the N \u2217 (1535) resonance\ncreated in the reaction p p \u2192 N \u2217 (1535) p can be described by a Breit-Wigner distribution\nof the form [17]:\n\u03c3(M) =\nwith\n\nAMR2 \u03932R\n(MR2 \u2212 M 2 )2 + MR2 \u03932R x2 (M, MR )\n\nx(M, MR ) = b\u03b7\n\nq\u03b7 (M)\nq\u03c0 (M)\n+ b\u03c0\nq\u03b7 (MR )\nq\u03c0 (MR )\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere b\u03b7 is the branching ratio of the decay N*(1535) \u2192 N \u03b7 (which we assume to be 55%),\nb\u03c0 is the branching ratio of the decay N*(1535) \u2192 N \u03c0 (which counts for 45%). q\u03c0 and q\u03b7\nare the momenta of \u03c0 and \u03b7 in the frame of the resonance and are given by:\nq\u03b7 (MN \u2217 ) =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\nq\u03c0 (MN \u2217 ) =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\nand\n\nMN2 \u2217 \u2212 Mp2 + M\u03b72 2\n) \u2212 M\u03b72\n2MN \u2217\n\n(7)\n\nMN2 \u2217 \u2212 Mp2 + M\u03c02 2\n(\n) \u2212 M\u03c02 .\n2MN \u2217\n\n(8)\n\n(\n\nWe note in passing that in reference [17] the square on the x in eq. 5 has been forgotten.

In addition to the\nthree body decay there may also be a two body one into a dilepton pair. The Particle Data\nGroup [14] quotes as an upper limit a branching ratio of 7.7 * 10\u22125 . We include this value in\nour standard calculation (standard will be explained later).\n\nC.\n\n\u03c9 production and decay\n\nThe \u03c9 production in pp collisions for excess energies below 440 MeV has been studied at\nCOSY [23], at SATURNE [24] and by the DISTO [25] collaboration.

Solid lines represent \u03b7 production including the\ncontribution of the N \u2217 (1535) resonance and dashed curves represent the direct production via an\nuniform three body phase space distribution.

It has been suggested that the production of the \u03c9 passes by the\nexcitation of baryon resonances [27, 28] where the N \u2217 (1535) plays a prominent role having\na substantial branching ratio into the N\u03c9 channel [29, 30, 31]. It produces \u03c9 mesons with\nmasses well below 783 MeV. If this were the case the strong \u03c9N coupling would lead to a\nstrong off-shell contribution to d\u03c3/dM (M being the invariant mass of the dilepton pair) at\ninvariant masses well below the free \u03c9 mass peak. This off-shell \u03c9 production would even\ndominate the dilepton spectra up to excess energies of several hundred MeV. Only very\nrecently calculations of the spectral function have been advanced which exploit the available\n\u03b3N and \u03c0N data in a coupled channel analysis [30, 32].\nA \u03b3A \u2192 \u03c9 experiment was recently performed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration. They observed that the pole mass decreases with increasing density of the environment. [33]. For momenta less than 500 MeV/c2 , they observed an \u03c9 pole mass of\n+35\n2\nM=[722+2\n\u22122 (stat)\u22125 (syst)] MeV/c for an average density of 0.6 \u03c10 . Unfortunately, no sig-\n\nnificant measurement of the width was obtained due to the dominance of the experimental\nresolution. Using this data and the Brown-Rho scaling formula:\nm\u2217\u03c9 = m0\u03c9 \u2217 (1 \u2212 \u03b1\n\n\u03c1\n)\n\u03c10\n\n(13)\n\nwe find \u03b1=0.13. Fig. 5 shows the density distribution at the \u03c9 production points for a C+C\ncollision at 2AGeV. The average density of < \u03c1 >=1.394 \u03c10 is twice as large as for the TAPS\nexperiment. Applying eq. 2 we obtain a wide distribution around the average pole mass of\nM= 641 MeV.\nIn our simulation we have the option to use this in-medium mass modification. Because\nthere are no conclusive results on the width we kept the free value of 8 MeV. The shape of\nthe invariant mass distribution of dileptons from the \u03c9 decay is given by the Breit-Wigner\ndistribution :\nm2\u2212\n\nr\n\nm2\n\n(1 + 2 M 2 ) 1 \u2212 4 Me\u22122\ndN\n=\n(M 2 /4\u2212m2 )3/2\ndM\n(m2\u03c9 \u2212 M 2 )2 + [m\u03c9 ( \u0393\u03c9Mm\u03c9 (m2 /4\u2212m2e\u2212 )3/2 )]2\ne\n\n\u03c9\n\n(14)\n\ne\u2212\n\nwith \u0393\u03c9 =8 MeV and m\u03c9 as defined in eq. 13.\nAnother uncertainty is the production of the \u03c9 in pn reactions.

Neglecting possible differences due to initial\nand final state interactions, we expect \u03c3(pn \u2192 pn\u03c9)/\u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03c9) = 5, if only isovector\nmesons (\u03c0, \u03c1) are exchanged [34]. The two data points for the reaction np \u2192 d\u03c9 point toward\nan enhancement of the pn cross section as compared to the pp cross section [34]. The error\n\n\f13\nbars are, however, too large in order to quantify this enhancement. In our simulations we\nassume \u03c3(pn \u2192 pn\u03c9) = b \u2217 \u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03c9) with different values of b.\nThe \u03c9 contributes to the dilepton spectrum in two different ways. Either it decays directly\ninto a dilepton pair whose invariant mass equals that of the \u03c9 meson or the dilepton pair is\naccompanied by a \u03c00 meson. For the latter channel the shape of the dilepton invariant mass\ndistribution has been parametrized by Kroll [15]\ns\n\nm2e\u2212\n1\nm2\u2212\nM2\nm2\u03c9 M 2\ndN\n2\n3/2\n=\n(1 + 2 e2 )[(1 + 2\n)\n\u2212\n4\n]\n1\n\u2212\n4\ndM\nM\nM\nm\u03c9 \u2212 m2\u03c00\n(m2\u03c9 \u2212 m2\u03c00 )2\nM2\n\n(15)\n\nwith M being the invariant dilepton mass.

The\nbranching ratios into the two channels are given by 5.9 * 10\u22124 (7.14 * 10\u22125 ) for the e+ e\u2212 \u03c0\n\n(e+ e\u2212 ) channel [14]. Both, the unknown pn cross section as well as the little known offshell contribution at small excess energies make it difficult to predict the \u03c9 contribution at\ninvariant dilepton masses between 0.6 and 0.8 GeV.\n\nD.\n\n\u03c1 production and decay\n\nIn our simulation the \u03c1 meson can be produced in three channels: NN \u2192 NN\u03c1, \u03c0N \u2192\n\n\u03c1N and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1.\n\nThe few experimental data points of the total cross section in the NN \u2192 NN\u03c1 channel\nhave been fitted by [35]\n\nwith\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n0.24( s \u2212 s0 )\n\u221a\n\u03c3N N \u2192N N \u03c1 (mb) =\n\u221a\n1.4 + ( s \u2212 s0 )2\n\n(18)\n\ns0 = 2.646 GeV being the threshold of the reaction. In view of the strong coupling\n\nof the \u03c1 to nuclear resonances this course-grained parametrization has most probably large\nsystematic errors and presents a lower limit to the \u03c1 production. Other models like URQMD\n\n\f14\nuse a parametrization of the resonance production which yield higher \u03c1 yields. For the \u03c0+N\n\u2192 N+\u03c1 data [30] we use the parametrization of [26]\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1.5( s \u2212 s0 )2.2\n\u221a\n\u03c3\u03c0N \u2192\u03c1N (mb) =\n\u221a\n0.0018 + ( s \u2212 s0 )3.5\n\u221a\nwith s0 = 1.708 GeV.\n\n(19)\n\nHaving a large width and therefore a short life time, the \u03c1 meson is an ideal particle to\nprobe whether the nuclear environment changes mesonic properties. If produced in hadronic\nmatter the majority of them decay in matter and therefore the dileptons carry direct information on the in-medium properties. Theory predicts that these properties are different\nfrom that of the free \u03c1. Whereas there seems to be now consensus that the width of the\n\u03c1 increases if brought into a nuclear environment [3, 36, 37], the question of how the pole\nmass changes is still debated. Based on QCD sum rule calculations, Hatsuda and Lee [38]\npredicted a lowering of the \u03c1 mass in a nuclear environment, a suggestion which has later\nbeen confirmed by Brown and Rho [39, 40]. More recent and more sophisticated calculations leave, on the contrary, the \u03c1 mass almost unchanged [3, 8, 37]. Experimentally the\nsituation is also far from being clear. In pA collisions [41] at 12 GeV a decrease of the mass\n(m(\u03c1)/m(0) = 1 \u2212 0.09\u03c1/\u03c10 - about half of the value predicted by theory) and no increase\nof the width has been reported. The dilepton data in In+In collisions at 158 AGeV [10]\nare best described using the free \u03c1 pole mass but a considerable broadening of the mass\ndistribution. In contradiction to the earlier theoretical expectations this broadening is almost symmetric around the pole mass but recently it has been pointed out [42] that the\n\u03a6-functional approach may explain this symmetry.\nWhether these experimental differences are exclusively due to the different environments\n(cold nuclear matter in pA reactions, an expanding meson dominated fireball after a possible\nphase transition from a quark gluon plasma in AA collisions) has not been fully explored\nyet. It is very difficult to exploit this experimental information for heavy ion reactions at\n2 AGeV where theory predicts that most of the \u03c1 mesons are decay products from nuclear\nresonances, especially of the N \u2217 (1520) resonance which has a branching ratio of 15 \u2212 25%\ninto the \u03c1N channel. For the present status of the theoretical spectral function calculations\nfor the \u03c1 meson we refer to [32, 43].\nAs for the \u03c9 meson the inconclusive situation of theory and experiment suggest to employ\n\n\f15\nfor this exploratory study the free pole mass distribution of the \u03c1:\nm2\u03c1\ndN\n= M 2 \u2212m2\ndM\n( m\u03c1 \u03c12 )2 + \u03932\u03c1\n\n(20)\n\nwith m\u03c1 = 0.775 GeV/c2 , m\u03c12 = 0.761 GeV/c2 , \u0393\u03c1 = 0.118 GeV/c2 [44] and the\nparametrized free cross sections. For the branching ratio of the \u03c1 into dileptons we use\n4.5 * 10\u22125.\nE.\n\npn - bremsstrahlung\n\nIn each np collisions real and virtual photons can be produced. The invariant mass\ndistribution of the e+ e\u2212 pairs, the decay product of the virtual photon, is given by:\nqmax + q0max\n1 \u03b12 1 s \u2212 (mp + mn )2\nqmax\ndP (s, M)\nln(\n=\n\u2212\n)\n2\n2\ndM\n3\u03c0 M\necm\nM\nq0max\nwith\nq0max =\n\ns + M 2 \u2212 (mp + mn )2\n\u221a\n2 s\n\nqmax =\n\u221a\n\nq\n\n2\nq0max\n\u2212 M 2.\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\ns is the np center of mass energy, ecm is the energy of the incoming proton in the np center\n\nof mass system, \u03b1 is the electromagnetic coupling constant, mp and mn the masses of proton\nand neutron, q0max the maximal dilepton energy and qmax the maximal dilepton momentum. The bremsstrahlung from pp collisions is of quadrupole type and can be neglected as\ncompared to the dipole pn bremsstrahlung.\n\nF.\n\n\u2206 Dalitz decay\n\nIt is not experimentally verified yet whether the Dalitz decay into e+ e\u2212 of the \u2206 resonance\nexists but since it decays into a photon it should also decay into a dilepton. The width of\nthe Dalitz-decay to dileptons of invariant mass M is determined by QED [45]:\n\u03b1 \u03930 (M 2 )\nd\u0393\n=\ndM 2\n3 \u03c0 M2\nwhere\n\u03930 (M 2 ) =\n\n\u03bb1/2 (M 2 , m2N , m2\u2206 )\nmN [2 Mt (M 2 ) + Ml (M 2 )]\n2\n16 \u03c0 m\u2206\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\n\f16\nis the total decay rate into a virtual photon with mass M and\n\u03bb(x, y, z) = x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 2(xy + xz + yz).\n\n(26)\n\nMt and Ml depend on the form of the interaction. For the \u2206 decay we take the N\u2206\u03b3 vertex\nfrom [46]. Using this interaction we obtain the following matrix elements:\nm2\u2206\nM 2 4(m\u2206 \u2212 mN \u2212 q0 )\n9 mN\nm2\nMt = (e f g)2 \u2206 [qo 2 (5 m\u2206 \u2212 3(q0 + mN )) \u2212 M 2 (m\u2206 + mN + q0 )]\n9 mN\nMl = (e f g)2\n\n(27)\n\nwith\n\nf = \u22121.5\n\nm\u2206 + mN\n,\nmN ((mN + m\u2206 )2 \u2212 M 2 )\n\n(28)\n\nq0 the energy of the dilepton pair in the \u2206 center of mass, e the electric charge and\ng = 2.72 is the coupling constant fitted to the photonic decay width \u03930 (0) = 0.72 MeV [47].\n\nIV.\n\nTHE C+C REACTION AT 2 AND 1 AGEV\n\nFor the simulation of the heavy ion reaction we use the IQMD program which has been\ndescribed in section I. The details of this program can be found in [13].\nThe presented results are impact parameter averaged and have been corrected for the\nexperimental mass resolution and acceptance with a program provided by the HADES collaboration. We have neglected in our calculation the reabsorption cross section of the \u03b7\nmesons which is of the order of 20 mb [48] in our kinematic domain but of little importance\nfor such a light system. We compare the results of the standard set up, where free masses\nand widths as well the most common extrapolations or theoretical predictions of unknown\ncross sections are used, with calculation in which it is assumed that the particle properties\nchange in the medium or in which other cross section parametrization are applied.\nFig. 6 shows the result of the standard simulation set up: \u03c3(np \u2192 np\u03b7) = 2\u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03b7) ,\n\n\u03c3(np \u2192 np\u03c9) = 5\u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03c9), M\u03c9 = M\u03c90 and the branching ratio BR\u03b7\u2192e+ e\u2212 = 7.7 * 10\u22125 . It\nis called standard because it uses standard literature values for the unknown physical input\n\nquantities. We see first of all that with the resolution of the HADES experiment the direct\n\u03b7 decay would yield a visible peak which is not present in the data. Therefore the upper\n\n\f17\nlimit has to be lower than that quoted by the Particle Data Group [14]. We see as well that\nthe simulations overpredict the yield in the region of the free \u03c9 mass. This confirms the\nresult of the simulations with other programs which have been published by the HADES\ncollaboration [12]. On the contrary, the simulations reproduce well the mass region in which\nthe lepton pairs are coming dominantly from the \u03b7 decay and from pn bremsstrahlung. If\nthe experimentally unknown \u03c3(np \u2192 pn\u03c9) equals \u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03c9) the yield in the M\u03c9 mass\nregion would be strongly reduced and comes closer to experimental data as can be seen\nin fig. 7. We obtain the same level of agreement with data if we take \u03c3(np \u2192 pn\u03c9) =\n5\u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03c9) but assume in addition that the mass of the \u03c9 decreases in the medium\naccording to eq. 13, as indicated by the CBELSA/TAPS results [33]. This can be seen in\nfig. 8. The experimental error bars are large, however, do not show much structure and\nthe deviations are only a factor of two. Higher statistics data would certainly improve this\nsituation. The best agreement is obtained in simulations with \u03c3(np \u2192 pn\u03c9) = \u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03c9)\nand an in medium \u03c9 mass, as seen in fig. 9.\nTherefore, without further informations on \u03c3(np \u2192 np\u03c9) heavy ion reactions will not\nreveal any robust information on in medium modifications of the \u03c9 meson.\nIf we assume \u03c3(np \u2192 np\u03b7) = \u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03b7) in the region where no data on the \u03c3(np \u2192\nnp\u03b7) cross section is available (only 5% of the \u03b7 are produced at an energy where experimental\ninformation on this cross section is available), we underpredict slightly the yield in this mass\nregion as seen in fig. 10. The experimental error bars are too large, however, in order to\nconclude more than that there are indications that if the mass of the \u03b7 does not change in\nthe medium the \u03c3(np \u2192 np\u03b7) is larger than \u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03b7) at excess energies above 100 MeV.\nAs for the \u03c9 meson possible in medium changes of the \u03b7 meson require a detailed study of\nits production in the pn channel.\nFig.11 summarizes the study of the influence of the parametrization of unknown processes\non the dilepton yield. If one compares the results of the different scenarios of table III with\nthe experimental results, we see that the standard parameterizations of these input quantities\n(A) yield not results which are in agreement with data at invariant dilepton masses around\n550 MeV and in between 750 MeV and 950 MeV. The former difference suggests that the\npartial width for the disintegration of the \u03b7 into a dilepton pair is much smaller than the\nupper limit quoted by the Particle Data Group [14]. The latter discrepancy contains the\ninteresting physics as far as in medium particle properties are concerned.

A variation of a factor of two gives results which are\nboth compatible with experiment.\nThus the C+C data at 2 AGeV show interesting new physics which is not compatible with\nthe input of state of the art transport codes. Unfortunately without further information on\nthe elementary cross sections with a neutron in the entrance channel it will not be possible\nto identify the origin of this discrepancy because a modification of the mass of the mesons\nin the medium yields the same effect as a change of the (experimentally unknown) cross\nsection in the np channel.\nLowering the energy to 1 AGeV the importance of the different channels changes and a\ncomparison between the 2 and 1 AGeV data will elucidate part of the physics.

In the intermediate\nmass region the \u2206 Dalitz decay and bremsstrahlung have gained importance and are of the\nsame order of magnitude.

The data at 1 AGeV should\ntherefore allow do define an upper limit of the \u2206 Dalitz decay. At higher invariant masses it is\nthe \u03b7 decay which contributes the other 50%.

The consequences of the broad\n\n\u221a\n\ns distribution on the \u03b7 and \u03c9\n\nproduction as compared to elementary collisions at the nominal energy are summarized in\n\u221a\ntable I. The first line shows the average s value of all collisions above threshold. For the \u03b7\nthis value is slightly below, for the \u03c9 - due to the larger threshold - slightly above the value\nfor elementary collisions. Also the average number of collisions in C+C reactions depends\non the particle type as seen in the second line. For the \u03b7 production we find 4.65 collisions\nabove threshold for the \u03c9 production 2.32. For the standard scenario (m\u03c9 = m0\u03c9 , BR(\u03b7 \u2192\ne+ e\u2212 ) = 7.7.10\u22125 , \u03c3(pn \u2192 pn\u03b7) = 2\u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03b7) and \u03c3(pn \u2192 pn\u03c9) = 5\u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03c9)), we\n\ndisplay in the third and the fourth line the average production cross section in np and pp\ncollisions in the heavy ion reaction as compared to the elementary reaction. For the \u03b7 the\naverage \u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03b7) and \u03c3(pn \u2192 pn\u03b7) are lower in CC collisions than in elementary ones.\n\u221a\nThis decrease has two origins: firstly the lower < scoll>threshold > and secondly the form of\n\u221a\nthe \u03b7 production cross section which has a maximum at around s=2.697 GeV and stays\nalmost constant at higher energies. For the \u03c9 meson the situation is completely different.\nThe elementary cross section increases with energy for all relevant energies and the average\n\u221a\ns value in C+C is larger than that in elementary collisions. Therefore np as well as pp\ncollisions in the heavy ion reaction produce more \u03c9 mesons than elementary collisions at the\n\n\f24\nsame nominal energy. Consequently the enhancement factor of \u03b7 and \u03c9 mesons in heavy ion\ncollisions is very different.\nFor the 1 AGeV reaction (table II) the situation is very different. The\n\n\u221a\n\ns distribution of\n\nthe collision in C+C is displayed in fig. 15. In elementary NN collisions at the same energy\n\u221a\n\u221a\nneither \u03c9 nor \u03b7 mesons can be produced ( sthreshold \u03c9 = 2.659 GeV and sthreshold \u03b7 =\n2.424 GeV). However, with the Fermi momentum, in C+C collisions subthreshold \u03c9 and \u03b7\nproduction is possible. Due to the larger threshold \u03c9 production is suppressed with respect\nto the \u03b7 production. The production cross section at this energy tests the Fermi motion\nin the simulations which is not easy to model in semi-classical simulation codes. Therefore\nsystematic errors reduce the predictive power for the meson production at this energy, but\nthe analysis of the subthreshold kaon production shows that in between a factor of two the\nresults are certainly trustworthy.\nIn summary we have shown that the dilepton spectrum measured by the HADES collaboration in the reaction 2 AGeV C+C at invariant masses above 600 MeV is not compatible\nwith the standard scenario of simulation programs which uses free cross sections and free\nmeson masses. Introducing a medium modification of the \u03c9 mass and lowering the unknown\npn \u2192 pn\u03c9 cross section brings the calculation in agreement with data. The extrapolation\nfrom elementary cross section at the same nominal energy to heavy ion reactions is all but\ntrivial. It depends on the threshold and on the energy dependence of the cross section.\nBefore the elementary production cross sections in pn reactions are not determined and before the cross sections for baryonic resonances are not better known heavy ion data do not\nprovide the desired information on possible in medium modification of the meson properties.\nAcknowledgment: We acknowledge valuable discussions with M.
