(2000) obtained Keck optical spectroscopy of the Hot Dog galaxy [= HDF 4-555.1\n(Williams et al. 1996) = C 4-06 (Steidel et al. 1996)] at\nz = 2.803, which is one of chain galaxies in the HDF. They\nfound that any systemic rotation of this galaxy is fairly\nsmall; < 100 km s\u22121 . This suggests strongly that this\ngalaxy is not an edge-on disk galaxy. Further, the presence of N v and He ii emission lines needs massive O stars\nas their ionization sources at least. Its blue color also indicates that the stellar populations should be young (< 108\nyr). This study reinforces the possibility that some chain\ngalaxies are really forming galaxies with a linear structure\nat high redshift as suggested by C95 (see also Abraham\n1997). Even if the majority of chain galaxies might be\nedge-on LSB galaxies at low redshift, it seems urgent to\ninvestigate possible origins of chain galaxies at high redshift such as the Hot Dog galaxy.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nRecent high-resolution optical imaging studies of some\ndeep fields have revealed a new population of galaxies at\nhigh redshift; chain galaxies [Cowie et al. 1995 (hereafter\nC95); van den Bergh et al. 1996 (hereafter vdB96)]. C95\nfound 28 candidates of such chain galaxies in their deep\nHST I band (F814W) images of the two Hawaii deep survey fields, SSA 13 and SSA 22. vdB96 also identified such\nchain galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF: Williams\net al. 1996); HDF 2\u2013234 (the tadpole or head-tail galaxy)\nand HDF 3\u2013531 (the chain galaxy). The chain galaxies tend to be very straight in morphology; their average\nmajor-to-minor axial ratio is \u223c 5. Another interesting\nproperty of the chain galaxies is that they are bluer on\naverage than galaxies with similar I magnitudes. Based\non these observational properties, C95 proposed that the\nchain galaxies comprise a new population of forming galaxies at high redshift (z \u223c 0.5 \u2013 3) because there is no local\ncounterpart.\nHowever, Dalcanton & Shectman (1996) proposed a new\ninterpretation that the chain galaxies are edge-on low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies at low redshift (z \u223c 0.03).\nThey first estimated true axial ratios of the chain galaxies\nstudied by C95. They showed that the true axial ratios\nrange between 2 and 14 in most cases but some extreme\ncases have the ratios higher than 20 if the HST images\nare deconvolved with the typical point spread function.\nThese higher axial ratios may favor the edge-on disk interpretation. They also showed that the ellipticity distributions of low-redshift LSB galaxies are consistent with the\nlow-redshift chain galaxies being edge-on manifestations\nof disks using their database of Las Campanas redshift\n\n2. OBSERVATIONAL PROPERTIES OF CHAIN GALAXIES\n\nPrior to presenting our new model, we summarize important observational properties of chain galaxies found\nby C95 and vdB96. A brief summary of the two surveys\nis given in Table 1.\n2.1. The C95 Sample\nC95 found 28 candidates of chain galaxies in the two\nHawaii deep survey fields, SSA 13 and SSA 22. The\nchain galaxies tend to be very straight and their major-tominor axial ratios range from 1.8 to 9.5 with an average\nof 4.8 \u00b1 2.0 for 21 galaxies brighter than I = 25. Two\nof them are intermediate-redshift galaxies; z = 0.489 for\nChain 0 and z = 0.505 for Chain 1. Another two galaxies\n1\n\n\f2\nare located at z = 1.36 (SSA 22\u201316) and at z \u223c 2.4 (SSA\n22\u201324) although the latter redshift estimate is based on\ninterpreting a break in the continuum at 4000 \u00c5 as the\nonset of intergalactic Ly\u03b1 forest.\nIt is found that the chain galaxies are bluer on average\nthan galaxies with similar I magnitudes studied by them.\nIn particular, they are very blue in B \u2212 K, suggesting that\nthey are not relatively normal galaxies in the rest ultraviolet band and that the peculiar morphologies are not a\nconsequence of the distribution of the star-forming regions.\n2.2. The vdB96 Sample\nvdB96 classified eleven galaxies either as the chain or\nas the tadpole galaxies. Their basic data are given in Table 2. In order to estimate their linear sizes and absolute\nmagnitudes, we need their redshifts. However, a spectroscopic redshift is available only for the galaxy 3-379, the\nID number in vdB96 (Steidel et al. 1996): z = 2.775.\nIt is interesting to note that this redshift is very close to\nthat of the Hot Dog galaxy, 2.803 (Steidel et al. 1996;\nBunker et al. 2000). For galaxies in the HDF, Fern\u00e1ndezSoto, Lanzetta, & Yahil (1999) estimated their photometric redshifts by using the SED (spectral energy distribution) fitting method1 . We use these photometric redshifts\nfor the remaining 10 galaxies. Unfortunately, photometric\nredshifts are not reliably determined for the two galaxies;\n3-367 and 4-627, which are not considered further. Then\nwe obtain a sample of the nine chain galaxies. We use this\nsample to investigate the observational properties of chain\ngalaxies; although the chain galaxies studied by C95 constitute the largest sample, their photometric data are less\navailable than those found in HDF.\nThe redshifts of the nine galaxies ranges from 0.5 to 2.8,\nbeing similar to the range estimated for the C95 sample\nof chain galaxies. Adopting a cosmology with the Hubble\nconstant, H0 = 100 h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 where h = 1 and the\ndensity parameter \u03a90 = 0.01, we estimate the linear size\n(d) and the absolute V magnitude (MV ) for each galaxy.\nThe results are given in Table 2. We find that d ranges\nfrom 1.2 kpc to 3.8 kpc and MV ranges from \u221216.2 to\n\u221221.5. Their average values are < d >\u2243 2.4 \u00b1 0.8 kpc\nand < MV >\u2243 \u221219.0 \u00b1 1.7, respectively. Since any inclination correction has not been made for the linear sizes,\nthey are lower limits. If they are disks viewed edge-on, the\nlinear sizes appear smaller than those of the present-day\ngalaxies. On the other hand, the absolute V magnitudes\nare almost comparable to those of the present-day galaxies. Frequency distributions of the redshifts, sizes, and\nabsolute magnitudes are shown in Figure 1.\nThe major-to-minor axial ratios of the nine galaxies\nrange from 1.6 to 5.9 and their average is 3.1 \u00b1 1.3, being similar to those of the chain galaxies studied by C95.\nHowever, as claimed by Dalcanton & Shectman (1996),\nthese axial ratios should be typically larger than 10 if the\nimages are deconvolved with the point spread function.\nIn summary, the vdB96 chain galaxies have the following important observational properties; d \u223c 2.4 kpc,\nMV \u223c \u221219 (or LV \u223c 3.4 \u00d7 109 L\u2299 ), and z \u223c 0.5 \u2013 3, all\n\nof which are similar to the chain galaxies of C95. These\nproperties reinforce that a population of chain galaxies\ndoes actually exist at intermediate and high redshift, even\nthough edge-on LSBs at low redshifts may share this appearance.\n3. MODEL\n\n3.1. Background and Motivation\nA simple explanation for high-z chain galaxies may be\nthat linear structures form during the collapse of the protogalactic gas (C95; Bunker et al. 2000). C95 suggested\nthat when star formation turns on it triggers induced star\nformation along the line of maximum density, being analogous to sequential propagation of OB star associations\nin molecular clouds. On the other hand, Bunker et al.\n(2000) suggested that star formation could be triggered\nby collapse along a filament (see also Abraham 1997). An\nalternative idea may be string-induced wakes as noted by\nC95. In this paper, we propose another idea that chain\ngalaxies arise from gaseous filaments which are formed in\na large-scale shocked shell caused either by a superwind or\nby interaction between superwinds of forming galaxies.\nThe starting point of our model is that the superwind\nactivity occurs in some giant galaxies which were assembled from a number of gaseous clumps at high redshift\nwithin the framework of so-called cold dark matter scenarios. This assumption implies that initial starbursts occur\nin some giant galaxies in their forming phase. We note\nbelow that a couple of lines of evidence for such luminous\nforming galaxies have been obtained recently.\n(1) A number of faint dusty galaxies have been found by\ndeep surveys at submillimeter (Smail et al. 1997,\n1998, 1999, 2000; Hughes et al. 1998; Barger et\nal. 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Barger, Cowie, & Sanders\n1999; Barger, Cowie, & Richards 2000; Ivison et al.\n2000b) and at far infrared (Kawara et al. 1998;\nEales et al. 1999; Puget et al. 1999). Most of\nthese objects are considered to be located at intermediate and high redshift (e.g., Ivison et al. 2000b)\nand thus their bolometric luminosities often exceed\n1012 L\u2299 , suggesting a very high star formation rate,\n\u22121\ni.e., >\n\u223c 100M\u2299 y . This implies that they are massive forming galaxies enshrouded by dusty clouds.\n(2) Ly\u03b1 emitters have been also found at high redshift\nz >\n\u223c 2 (Hu & McMahon 1996; Cowie & Hu 1998;\nKeel et al. 1999; Steidel et al. 2000). All these are\nindeed well-defined candidates of forming galaxies\nwith a high star formation rate. A remarkable class\nof such Ly\u03b1 emitters is called as \"Ly\u03b1 blobs\" (Steidel et al. 2000) which are spatially extended ionized\nnebulae. These blobs may be interpreted as possible evidence for the superwind activity (Taniguchi &\nShioya 2000).\nTherefore, it seems reasonable to accept that the superwind activity works at high redshift. Although it is unlikely that massive galaxies could be born ubiquitously in\n\n1 Hogg et al. (1998) made a comparison between various photometric redshift predictions and spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in the\nHDF. They found that the best photometric redshift schemes predict spectroscopic redshifts with a redshift accuracy of \u2206z < 0.1 for more than\n68% of galaxies and with \u2206z < 0.3 for 90 \u2013 100%. The photometric redshift for 3-379, zphot = 1.72, appears significantly different from the\nspectroscopic one, zspec = 2.8 (see Table 2). However, when we use a certain set of SEDs generated by using the stellar population synthesis\ncode GISSEL96 (Bruzual & Charlot 1993), one obtains zphot \u2243 2.2.\n\n\f3\nthe early universe, it seems worthwhile investigating the\ngravitational instability in shocked shells driven by superwinds from forming galaxies located in some over-dense\nregions at high redshift; such over-dense regions beyond\nz = 3 have been found by Steidel et al. (2000) and Ivison\net al. (2000a).\nIt is also noted that we are not simply resurrecting the\nexplosion scenarios proposed by Ostriker & Cowie (1981)\nand Ikeuchi (1981). What we assume here is that some\nmassive galaxies were assembled from gaseous clumps at\nhigh redshift (i.e., the hierarchical clustering scenario) and\nthen intense starbursts occurred in them, leading to the\nsuperwind activity in such over-dense regions.\n3.2. Model\nFirst we give a summary of our model. Step I: Successive merging of subgalactic gas clumps results in the\nformation of a galaxy with a mass of 1011\u221212 M\u2299 at redshift z \u223c 5. Step II: Subsequently, supernova explosions\noccur inside the galaxy and then blow out as a galactic\nwind (or a superwind). This wind expands into the intergalactic space and then causes a large-scale shell with a\nradius of several hundreds of kpc. Since this radius may be\nsmaller than the typical separation between galaxies, interactions of shells may also occur, resulting in the formation\nof a large-scale gaseous slab. Step III: Since the shell or\nthe slab can be regarded as a gaseous sheet, filament-like\ngravitational instability is expected to occur. Step IV:\nFurther gravitational instability occurs in each filament,\nleading to intense star formation along the filament. This\nis the chain galaxy phase. Step V: The filament collapses\ngravitationally into one spheroidal system like an elliptical galaxy within one dynamical timescale of the filament\n(\u223c 108 yr). A schematic illustration of our model is shown\nin Figure 2.\nWe begin our scenario with the superwind activity expected from forming galaxies at high redshift (e.g., Arimoto & Yoshii 1987). It is considered that intense star\nformation (i.e., a starburst) occurs at the epoch of galaxy\nformation in the galaxy center, producing a galactic wind\nwhich lasts for a characteristic time tGW (\u223c 0.5 Gyr for\nan elliptical with a stellar mass of 1011 M\u2299 : Arimoto &\nYoshii 1987). Since infalling gas is accreting onto the\ngalaxy at times t \u2265 tGW , the wind interacts with this gas,\nand shocked gaseous shells form in the outer regions of the\ngalaxy. If the shells are unstable gravitationally, clumps\nmay be formed within them. This explosion-driven formation mechanism has been applied to the formation of\ngalaxies (Ostriker & Cowie 1981; Ikeuchi 1981; Ikeuchi,\nTomisaka, & Ostriker 1983), dwarf galaxies (Mori, Yoshii,\n& Nomoto 1999), and globular clusters (Taniguchi, Trentham, & Ikeuchi 1999).\nA strong observational constraint on such explosiondriven formation scenarios arises from the very small fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observed by COBE (Fixen et al. 1996); i.e., the\ndimensionless cosmological distortion parameters are limited to |y| < 1.5\u00d710\u22125 and |\u03bc| < 9\u00d710\u22125 (95% confidence\nlevel)2 . These limits lead to the fractional energy limit of\n\u2206U/U = 4y < 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 where U is the energy of the\n\nCMB and \u2206U is the energy converted from other forms.\nThe energy of the CMB per L\u2217 galaxy is estimated to be\n\u223c 1063 (1 + z) ergs (Wright et al. 1994). Therefore, the\nabove fractional energy limit implies that the explosion\nenergy per L\u2217 galaxy must be smaller than 6 \u00d7 1058(1 + z)\nergs. Since the explosion-driven formation of galaxies proposed by Ostriker & Cowie (1981) and Ikeuchi (1981) violates this limit, they are rejected by the COBE observations (Wright et al. 1994).\nTherefore, in our model, we take the fractional energy\nlimit into account. Assuming that the superwind activity\noccurs at z = 5, we obtain the upper limit of the energy ejected from an L\u2217 galaxy, 3.6 \u00d7 1059 ergs. This\nenergy corresponds to that released from 3.6 \u00d7 108 supernovae because the energy released by a single supernova is 1051 ergs. Thus the total number of supernovae\nallowed per L\u2217 galaxy is NSN = 3.6 \u00d7 108 . Here we assume that the initial starburst occurs obeying a Salpeter\ninitial mass function with the lower-mass and higher-mass\ncutoffs, Ml = 0.1 M\u2299 and Mu = 100 M\u2299 , respectively. It\nis known that massive stars with a mass of m > 8M\u2299 are\nprogenitors of type II supernovae. In the above star formation, the number of such high mass stars per unit gas\nmass (1M\u2299 ) is estimated to be \u2243 0.007. Therefore, the\nmass of a galaxy which produce NSN = 3.6 \u00d7 108 is estimated as Mgal \u223c NSN /0.007 \u223c 5 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 , being roughly\ncomparable to that of an L\u2217 galaxy.\nThen we consider the physical conditions of the shell\nformed by the superwind from such an L\u2217 galaxy following\nOstriker & Cowie (1981). In the radiative cooling epoch,\nthe radius of the cooled shell is\n\u0003\u22120.4\n\u0002 2\n0.3\nRcool = 3E61\nMpc,\n(1)\nh \u03a90 (1 + z)3\nand the gas mass swept out to the shell is\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\u22120.21\n0.88\nMcool = 2 \u00d7 1013 E61\nh \u03a90 (1 + z)3\nM\u2299 ,\ntogether with the cooling time,\n\u0003\u22120.5\n\u0002 2\n0.2\ntcool = 6E61\nGyr.\nh \u03a90 (1 + z)3\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere E61 is the explosion energy in units of 1061 ergs. If\nwe assume that a shell is formed from this swept-out gas,\nits surface mass density is\nMcool\n0.28 1.18 0.59\n= 3.71\u00d710\u22125E61\nh \u03a90 (1+z)1.77 g cm\u22122 .\n2\n4\u03c0Rcool\n(4)\nAdopting \u03a90 = 0.01, h = 1, z = 5, and E61 = 0.036,\nwe obtain Rcool = 0.81 Mpc, Mcool = 9.1 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , and\n\u03a3cool = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 g cm\u22122 for the shell formed by the\nsuperwind from the L\u2217 galaxy.\nSince the cooling time is estimated as \u2243 2.1 Gyr, the\nshell will form at redshift zshell \u223c 1.6 given the above cosmological parameters. Since the number density of galaxies in the present-day universe is nG (0) \u223c 0.01 Mpc\u22123 ,\nnG (z) is estimated as nG (0)(1 + z)3 . Given the adopted\ncosmology, we obtain nG (1.6) \u2243 0.18 Mpc\u22123 , giving an\n\n\u03a3cool =\n\n2 Recently, Battistelli, Fulcoli, & Macculi (2000) re-estimated the external calibrator (XCAL) emissivity and then obtained the following\nnew upper limits; |y| < 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 and |\u03bc| < 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 (95% confidence level). These values are closer to the previous estimates by Mather\net al. (1994). However, in our paper, we adopt the strongest constraints obtained by Fixen et al. (1996).\n\n\f4\n\u22121/3\n\naverage separation, LG = nG (4\u03c0/3)\u22121/3 \u2243 1.1 Mpc.\nAlthough this is slightly larger than Rcool , it is suggested\nthat such superwinds will overlap in some cases because\nwe assume that the superwinds occur from giant galaxies in over-dense regions of the universe. In either case,\na large-scale shocked shell with a radius of \u223c 1 Mpc can\nbe formed in this model. The physical parameters of the\nshell are summarized in Table 3 for \u03a90 = 0.01, 0.1, and 1\nand h = 0.5, 0.75, and 1.\nThen we investigate what happens in such a shell. Since\nthe radius of the shell is so large, the shell can be approximated on sufficiently small scales (i.e., \u223c 10 kpc) by a\nplaner, self-gravitating layer, or sheet (e.g., Elmegreen &\nElmegreen 1978). It is known that gravitational instability in an isothermal self-gravitating sheet results in the\nformation of filaments (Miyama, Narita, & Hayashi 1987a,\n1987b; Curry 2000 and references therein). According to\nCurry (2000), the critical wavelength of the filamentary\ninstability is defined as\n\u03bbcr = cs [2\u03c0/(G\u03c1shell )]1/2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere cs is the sound speed, \u03c1shell is the mass density of\na sheet and G is the gravitational constant. If we assume\nthat \u03c1shell \u223c 10\u03c1cr (z) where \u03c1cr (z) = \u03c1cr (0)(1 + z)3 , we\nobtain \u03c1shell \u2243 3.34 \u00d7 10\u221227 g cm\u22123 at z = 1.6. Since it is\nexpected that the sound velocity is cs \u223c 10 km s\u22121 (e.g.,\nOstriker & Cowie 1981), we obtain \u03bbcr \u2243 54 kpc. Using\nthe mass density together with the surface mass density\nof the shell, we obtain the thickness of the shell (sheet),\n\u2206R = \u03a3cool /\u03c1 \u223c 2.2 kpc. Thus an initial major-to-minor\naxial ratio is \u223c 25, being consistent with the axial ratios estimated for the chain galaxies (see Dalcanton & Shectman\n1996). According to Miyama et al. (1987a, 1987b), it is\nexpected that this filament experiences the beads instability and then collapses along the major axis of the filament,\nforming an elliptical-like galaxy. Even if a cigar-like, prolate galaxy could be formed from the filament, it would be\ndynamically unstable and thus evolve to a rounder elliptical galaxy (Merritt & Hernquist 1991).\nThe mass density of the shell leads to the dynamical\ntimescale of the sheet, \u03c4dyn \u223c (G\u03c1shell )\u22121/2 \u2243 2.1 \u00d7 109 yr.\nSince this timescale is comparable to the cooling time, it\nis considered that chain galaxies can be formed at z \u2243 1.6.\nHowever, we note that chain galaxies could be born preferentially in higher-density regions in the shocked shell and\nthus the formation epoch may be earlier than the above\nredshift. In order to explain the formation of chain galaxies\nat z \u223c 3, one may assume that the epoch of the superwind\nactivity occurs at z > 5.\nNow let us estimate the mass of the filament considered above. The filament could grow in mass by accumulating gas clouds within a roughly regular square region with a length of \u03bbcr and a thickness of \u2206R. Therefore, we estimate the mass of the filament, Mfilament \u223c\n\u03bb2cr \u2206R \u03c1 \u223c 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Since a typical luminosityto-mass ratio of O stars is \u223c 103 , this filament becomes\nas luminous as \u223c 1011 L\u2299 . Note that this luminosity is\nachieved if a burst of massive-star formation occurs in it\nwith very high star-formation efficiency (approximately\n100%). The reason for such high efficiency is that a\nfilament-like structure is inherently unstable and will disrupt on a time scale comparable to the transverse cross-\n\ning time; \u03c4cross \u2243 0.72\u00d7108(d/2.4 kpc)(v/10 km s\u22121 )\u22121 yr\n(C95). The above luminosity is roughly comparable to the\nobserved luminosities of the chain galaxies although they\nshow a large scatter from \u223c 7 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 to \u223c 4 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299\nin LV (see Table 2); this scatter may be attributed to\nthe density fluctuation in the shocked shell. After the intense star formation ceases (\u223c 108 years after the formation; Abraham 1997), this filament rapidly fades and then\nevolves dynamically to a dwarf elliptical-like galaxy with\n8\n<\n\u223c 10 L\u2299 . This may explain why we cannot find remnants\nof the chain galaxies.\nFinally we estimate how many chain galaxies are formed\nin the shocked shell. Since the mass of the shocked shell\nis Mcool \u2243 9.1 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and that of a chain galaxy is\nMchain \u223c 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , the maximum number of dwarf\ngalaxies is Nchain \u223c 3000\u03b7chain,100 where \u03b7chain,100 is the\nformation efficiency of chain galaxies in the shell in units\nof 100%. Since the radius of the shocked shell is Rcool \u2243\n0.81 Mpc, the volume number density of chain galaxies is\nestimated as nchain \u223c 1350\u03b7chain,100 Mpc\u22123 . However, it is\nunlikely that galaxies were formed with such the very high\nefficiency because the chain galaxy formation could occur\npreferentially in higher-density regions in the shell. If we\nadopt \u03b7chain,100 = 0.1 (i.e., 10% efficiency; see section 4.2),\nwe obtain nchain \u223c 135 Mpc\u22123 .\nGiven \u03b7chain,100 = 0.1, 300 chain galaxies could be\nformed in one shocked shell. The shocked shell radius,\nRcool \u2243 0.81 Mpc, corresponds to an angular size of 2.5\narcmin at z \u223c 1. This leads to a nominal surface number density of chain galaxies formed in one shocked shell\n\u03c3chain \u2243 300/(\u03c02.52) \u2243 15 arcmin\u22122 . However, since\nthe lifetime of the chain galaxy phase (\u03c4chain \u223c 108 yr)\nis much shorter than the Hubble time (\u03c4Hubble \u223c 1010\nyr), the surface number density of chain galaxies made in\none shocked shell is statistically estimated as \u03c3chain,stat \u223c\n\u22121\n\u03c3chain \u03c4chain \u03c4Hubble\n\u223c 0.15 arcmin\u22122 . As summarized in\nTable 1, the observed surface density of the chain galaxies\nis a few chain galaxies arcmin\u22122 . Comparing this with the\nabove estimate, we suggest that ten shocked shells at different redshifts (e.g., z \u223c 0.5 \u2013 3) are included in the sky\nareas of the deep survey fields. This also implies that only\na small number of galaxies could experience the superwind\nactivity leading to the formation of a shocked shell.\nOur model also predicts that several chain galaxies can\nbe found at nearly the same redshift because they are associated with one shocked shell. It is again interesting to\nnote that the redshift of the Hot Dog galaxy (z = 2.803) is\nvery close to the chain galaxy 3-379 in vdB96 (z = 2.775).\nAmong the eight galaxies with their photometric redshifts\n(Table 2), the following two pairs have the same redshifts;\n1) zphot = 0.92 for 2-234 and 3-621, and 2) zphot = 1.60 for\n4-241 and 3-531. Although most chain galaxies are unfortunately very faint [I814 (AB) >\n\u223c 23], it should be possible\nto perform optical/NIR spectroscopy of the chain galaxies\nfound by C95 and vdB96 in the near future.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\n4.1. How Can Parent Galaxies of Chains Be Seen ?\nOur model may be one of possible mechanisms to form\nchain galaxies at high redshift. Our model predict that\nthere should be massive parent galaxies located within\n1 Mpc which produced the shells during a burst of star\n\n\f5\nformation at much higher redshift. They can be seen as\npassively-evolving galaxies at nearly the same redshift as\nthat of certain chain galaxies. Using photometric redshifts\nof the HDF galaxies provided by Fern\u00e1ndez-Soto et al.\n(1999), we try to search for such parent galaxies.\nThe most interesting chain galaxy in the vdB96 sample is the chain galaxy 3-367 at z = 2.775 because the\nHot Dog galaxy is also located at nearly the same redshift. However, since Fern\u00e1ndez-Soto et al. (1999) give its\nphotometric redshift zphot = 1.72 (see Table 2), it seems\ndifficult to search for its parent galaxy candidates. Then,\nas a trial, we try to search for parent galaxy candidates for\nthe following two pairs of chain galaxies; 1) vdB96 2-234\nand 3-621 at zphot = 0.92, and 2 ) vdB96 4-241 and 3-531\nat zphot = 1.60.\nSince the bin size of photometric redshift studied by\nFern\u00e1ndez-Soto et al. (1999) is \u03b4z = 0.02, we try to find\ngalaxies with zphot = 0.92 or 1.60. We have found 40\ngalaxies at z = 0.92 and 35 ones at z = 1.60 in the HDF.\nHowever, parent galaxies should be passively-evolving ones\nand thus we reject galaxies with blue SEDs such as those\nof irregular galaxies. Then we find three possible candidates whose SEDs are relatively red at z = 0.92 and only\none at z = 1.60. The results are summarized in Table 4.\nAmong the three galaxies at z = 0.92, two galaxies (Nos.\n531 and 536) have lower luminosities than L\u2217 . Therefore,\nthe remaining galaxy (No. 466) may be the most probable\ncandidate although its projected separation is 0.58 Mpc\nfrom vdB96 3-621 and 0.73 Mpc from vdB96 2-234. As for\nthe candidate galaxy at z = 1.60, its luminosity is higher\nthan L\u2217 and the projected separation is 0.26 Mpc from\nvdB96 3-531 and 0.25 Mpc from vdB96 4-241. Therefore,\nthis seems a promising candidate of the parent galaxy.\nHere it is again noted that the accuracy of photometric\nredshifts is not high enough to identify the parent galaxies conclusively. In order to find firmer candidates, we\nwill need the spectroscopic redshift for a large number of\ngalaxies in the HDF.\n4.2. Connection to the Formation of Dwarf Galaxies\nAs described in section 3, it is expected that the chain\ngalaxies formed in our model will evolve to dwarf galaxies\nbecause their masses are of the order of \u223c 108 M\u2299 . Therefore, our scenario may also be related to the formation of\ndwarf galaxies.\nFirst, we estimate the maximum number of dwarf galaxies formed in the shocked shell. Since we assume that\ndwarf galaxies are the descendents of chain galaxies, the\nmaximum number is the same as that of the chain galaxies; i.e., Ndwarf = Nchain \u223c 3000\u03b7chain,100. Thus, the\nvolume number density of dwarf galaxies is estimated as\nndwarf = nchain \u223c 1350\u03b7chain,100 Mpc\u22123 .\nRecently, Gnedin (2000) investigated an average star\nformation law during the first 3 Gyr using the observational data of Local Group dwarf galaxies. His analysis showed that the data are consistent with the orthodox Schmidt law with a star formation efficiency of about\n4%. Since our model is applicable to galaxies in over-dense\nregions, the formation efficiency may be higher than the\nabove estimate. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume\nthat the formation of chain galaxies in the shocked shell\nis roughly 10%, as adopted in section 3. Then, the volume number density of dwarf galaxies is down to ndwarf \u223c\n\n135 Mpc\u22123 . This is significantly lower than the observed\nnumber density of dwarf (elliptical) galaxies in the Virgo\ncluster (i.e., an over-dense region in the local universe) is\n\u223c 300 Mpc\u22123 (Binggeli, Sandage, & Tammann 1988). Although chain galaxies could contribute to the formation of\ndwarf galaxies, the majority of the dwarf galaxies in the\nVirgo cluster may be formed from other mechanisms; e.g.,\nthe gravitational collapse of less-massive gas clumps or the\ntidally-induced formation (e.g., Okazaki & Taniguchi 2000\nand references therein).\n4.3. Connection to Lyman Limit Systems and Damped\nLy\u03b1 Absorbers\nThe shocked gaseous shell formed by the superwind activity may be important absorbing material in the intergalactic space. Indeed, the surface mass density of the\nshocked shell, \u03a3cool \u2243 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 g cm\u22122 , corresponds to\nthe H i column density, NHI \u2243 1.4 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . Since the\ntemperature of IGM may be \u223c 104 K at most, the ionization correction seems modest. Therefore, shocked shells\nformed by forming massive galaxies may cause some Ly17\n\u22122\nman limit systems (NHI >\n\u223c 10 cm : e.g., Steidel 1990)\nfound in high-z quasar spectra. Furthermore, if we see\n\u25e6\nsuch shells from a highly inclined angle (e.g., \u03b8view >\n\u223c 80 )\nor their tangential sections, the H i column density exceeds 1020 cm\u22122 , causing damped Ly\u03b1 systems (e.g., Peebles 1993; Wolfe et al. 1995). Or, more likely, the damped\nLy\u03b1 systems may arise in the last stages of gravitational\ncollapse of the filaments just as star formation commences.\nSmall cloudlets breaking into intergalactic medium (IGM)\n15\n\u22122\nmay be observed as Ly\u03b1 forests with NHI <\n\u223c 10 cm .\nThe shock velocity is given by\n\u00030.11\n\u0002 2\n0.05\nvcool = 200E61\nkm s\u22121\n(6)\nh \u03a90 (1 + z)3\n(Ostriker & Cowie 1981). Adopting E61 = 0.036, h = 1,\n\u03a90 = 0.01, and z = 1, we obtain vcool \u2243 130 km s\u22121 .\nTherefore, the absorption feature caused by one shocked\n\u22121\nshell may have the line width of <\n\u223c 260 km s . However,\nthe velocity widths observed for most high-column-density\nabsorption systems (determined from unsaturated low-ion\nspecies) are much less than 260 km s\u22121 . It is also noted\nthat our model is applicable to the case that an absorbing galaxy is located significantly far from the quasar; i.\ne., the projected distance up to several hundreds kpc is\nacceptable.\nIn our model, some giant galaxies in over-dense regions\nin the universe could experience initial starbursts and then\nshow the superwind activity. Therefore, shocked shells\nmay not be formed ubiquitously in high-z universe. As\nmentioned in section 3, the observed surface density of\nchain galaxies suggests that there are only several shocked\nshells at most in the redshift interval between 0.5 and 3.\nTherefore, our model predicts a few high-z Lyman limit or\ndamped Ly\u03b1 systems per unit redshift along a 1D sightline.\" Stengler-Larrea et al. (1995) showed that the number density of Lyman limit systems as a function of redshift\nis described by N (z) \u2243 N0 (1 + z)\u03b3 where N0 = 0.25 and\n\u03b3 = 1.5. This gives N (3) \u2243 2, being consistent with our\nprediction.\nAnother interesting issue related to our model is the\nmetal enrichment in the IGM. One important consequence\nof our model is that such H i absorber must be polluted\n\n\f6\nchemically because the superwind contains a lot of heavy\nelements. It has been argued that supernova explosions\nlead to the chemical enrichment of IGM at high redshift\n(e.g., Ostriker & Gnedin 1996; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Rees\n1997; Aguirre et al. 2000). We estimate the metal enrichment due to the superwind. The mass of metal ejected\nfrom a star is mZ = \u01ebZ m\u2217 where \u01ebZ is the mass fraction\nof metal with respect to the stellar mass. Thus the total\nmetal enrichment due to the superwind can be estimated\nas\n\u2206Z =\n\n\u01ebZ m\u2217 NSN\n\u2243 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u01ebZ\n2 \u2206R\u03c1\n4\u03c0Rcool\nshell\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we adopt m\u2217 = 10M\u2299 as the typical mass of progenitors of type II supernovae. We then obtain \u2206Z \u2243\n4.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 if \u01ebZ = 0.1. Since the metal abundance observed in Ly\u03b1 forests (e.g., Pettini et al. 1997; Songaila &\nCowie 1996; Lu et al. 1998) is of the order of 0.01 Z\u2299 where\nZ\u2299 is the solar metal abundance in mass (Z\u2299 = 0.02); i.e.,\nZIGM \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . Therefore, the metal ejection as a result\nof the superwind from a forming massive galaxy may be\nresponsible for the observed metal abundance in the IGM\nat high redshift.\n5. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe chain galaxies found in the recent optical deep surveys have been investigated in terms of the gravitational\ninstability of shocked shells formed by a superwind or by\ninteraction between superwinds of forming galaxies at high\nredshift. Our new model appears consistent with the observational properties of the chain galaxies. Since the\nchain galaxies are expected to evolve to dwarf galaxies\nwith a mass of \u223c 108 M\u2299 , our model explains why there is\nno local counterpart.\nWe have also discussed that shocked shells may be responsible for some Lyman limit systems and damped Ly\u03b1\nsystems observed in quasar spectra because their H i col17\n\u22122\numn densities exceed NHI >\n\u223c 10 cm . The metal enrichment up to Z \u223c 0.01Z\u2299 can be achieved by the pollution\nfrom supernova ejecta. In order to investigate this possibility further, we need very high-resolution, emission-line\nimaging of some counterparts of damped Ly\u03b1 systems at\nhigh redshift.\nThe size of such shocked shells is too large (i.e., \u223c\n1 Mpc) to be detected if the sky coverage of deep surveys is not so large. In order to find firm observational evidence for such shocked shells, wide-field, deep\nsurveys will be also very important in future. The\nSUPRIME-Cam (the Subaru prime focus camera; e.g.,\nhttp://SubaruTelescope.org/Introduction/instrument.html)\nseems to be the most efficient tool to perform such surveys.\nWe would like to thank S. Ikeuchi, S. Miyama, and M.\nHattori for giving us useful scientific input and S. Okamura for useful discussion on the capability of SUPRIMECam on the Subaru telescope. We would also thank an\nanonymous referee for his/her very useful comments and\nsuggestions which improved this paper significantly. YS\nis a JSPS fellow.
