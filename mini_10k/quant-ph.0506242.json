Imperfect control\noperations are one of several sources of error.While errorcorrection schemes designed to correct for general errors\n[1] no doubt also correct control errors, error-correction\nor error-avoidance schemes tuned to the dominant physical error model are more efficient and practical. Specialized error-correction schemes can also tolerate higher\nnoise rates.\nThis paper specializes to systematic control errors of\nthe following form. When we try to apply the singlequbit pulse U = exp(i\u03b8n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 ), a 2\u03b8 rotation about axis\nn\u0302, we in fact apply \u016a = U V . The error is systematic\nin the sense that it is invertible; attempting to apply\nU \u2020 in fact applies \u016a \u2020 . The form of the error V is of\ncourse restricted. Previous authors [2, 3] have considered\nthe case of linear over-rotational errors: V = exp(i\u01eb\u03b8n\u0302 *\n~\u03c3 ) where \u01eb is fixed and small, but unknown. Here, we\nconsider the case of general over-rotational errors, V =\nexp[i\u01eb(|\u03b8|, n\u0302)n\u0302 *~\u03c3 ]. The amount of over-rotation, \u01eb(|\u03b8|, n\u0302),\ncan now depend arbitrarily on the rotation angle 2\u03b8 and\nalso the axis of rotation n\u0302.\nOur error-correction method is a new composite pulse\nsequence, inspired by the generalization of quantum\nsearch known as amplitude amplification [4]. In this algorithm, the amplitude produced in a particular target subspace by applying some unitary \u016a to a source state is amplified by successively repeating R0 (\u03c0)\u016a \u2020 Rt (\u03c0)\u016a . Here\nR0 (\u03c0) and Rt (\u03c0) are selective reflections about the source\nand target, respectively. In standard quantum search,\nthe source is |0n i, \u016a = H \u2297n transverse Hadamard, and\nthe target is a bit string |xi. In the subspace spanned by\n\u016a |0n i and |xi, the state vector steadily rotates toward\n|xi. Eventually, it rotates past the target.\nWhat happens in quantum search if we don't merely re-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: breic@cs.berkeley.edu\naddress: lkgrover@bell-labs.com\n\nflect about the source and target, but instead add a phase\nother than \u03c0? It is well known that any phase bounded\naway from 0 works to give a square-root speedup (with\ndifferent constants); for example, this fact is used in a\nstronger form in Ambainis's element distinctness algorithm [5]. One of us (LG) noticed that concatenating the\nbasic sequence\n\u016a R0 (\u03c0/3)\u016a \u2020 Rt (\u03c0/3)\u016a\nV\u2020\nresults in the state converging\nto the target subspace and\nnot overshooting it, when viewed at times 3k , k \u2208 N [6].\nFigure\n\u03c0/3 1 gives some geometrical intuition.\n\u03c0/3\nFor the present problem of systematic control errors,\nthere is no source or target \u2013 we desire a \"fully compensating\" pulse\nsequence accurate\non an arbitrary inV\nV\nV\u2020\n\u03c0/3\n\n\u03c0/3\nV\n\nV\nV\u2020\n\n\u03c0/5\n\n\u03c0/5\nV\u2020\n\nV\u2020\n3\u03c0/5\n\n3\u03c0/5\nV\u2020\n\n\u03c0/5\n\nV\n\n\u03c0/5\n\nV\n\nV\u2020\n\nV\u2020\n\nFIG. 1: Looking down along the vector |si, the top diagram shows why when ht|\u016a |si = hs|V |si is close to\n3\u03c0/5\n3\u03c0/5\none, ht|\u016a R0 (\u03c0/3)\u016a \u2020 Rt (\u03c0/3)\u016a |si = hs|V R0 V \u2020 R0 V |si is even\ncloser to one. The bottom diagram gives similar intuition for\na longer pulse sequence.\n\nV\n\nV\n\n\f2\nput \u2013 but a similar calculation still applies. We need\nmerely choose a source arbitrarily, say the X +1 eigenstate |+i, and set the target accordingly (to U |+i). Assume n\u0302 = (0, 0, 1). Let R0 = exp(i \u03c06 X) a \u03c0/3 rotation\nabout the X axis, and Rt = U R0 U \u2020 . When we apply the\nsequence of noisy pulses\nR\u0304t\u2020 \u016a R\u03040 \u016a \u2020 R\u0304t \u016a R\u03040\u2020 ,\nthe different systematic errors in both \u016a and the noisy\n\u03c0/3 rotations largely cancel out, leaving behind a higherorder error. (The extra pulses at either end adjust for the\nphase difference between |+i and its orthogonal complement |\u2212i which would otherwise be introduced.) This\ncorrection sequence can be concatenated on itself in a certain way to reduce errors arbitrarily. A directly related\nmethod also applies to over-rotational errors in two-qubit\ngates [7].Therefore this composite pulse sequence allows\nfor an arbitrarily accurate set of universal gates, giving\na threshold result for this error model.\nWe also consider another error model of systematic errors in even the rotation axis n\u0302: V = exp(i~\u01eb *~\u03c3 ). Here the\nerror ~\u01eb may depend on the rotation angle 2\u03b8 but, except\nfor a specific coordinate change, not on the axis n\u0302. For\nexample, R0 and Rt are related by the coordinate change\nRt = U R0 U \u2020 . We require that the errors be related by\nthe same coordinate change, or R\u0304t = U R\u03040 U \u2020 .\nSection II describes the basic idea behind the composite pulse sequence, by explaining its behavior when the\n\u03c0/3 rotations are perfect. In the two following sections,\nwe extend the error model to the two cases described\nabove.\nComposite pulse sequences are an important, practical\nquantum control tool for removing systematic errors in a\nvariety of quantum information processing implementations [8, 9].We need to show that our correction sequence\nremains practical. While the error models we address are\nmore general than the linear over-rotational errors which\nhave previously been considered, the control requirement\nis also stricter. We typically require the ability to rotate\nabout an arbitrary axis in the Bloch sphere, not just\none in the xy plane. If rotations are only allowed about\naxes in the xy plane as in most NMR-type models, then\nour method only applies to correct \u03c0 pulses. In Sec. V,\nwe compare our method, with \u03c0 pulses and linear overrotational errors, to previous fully-compensating composite pulse sequences, particularly those recently discovered\nin [2].\n\ntwo terms might be different. For the rest of this section,\nhowever, assume R\u03040 and R\u0304t are perfect, so R\u03030 = R\u03040 =\nR0 \u2261 exp(i \u03c06 X).\nWrite V = exp(i~\u01eb * ~\u03c3 ), where \u03c3 = (X, Y, Z). Generally,\neach term of ~\u01eb may be nonzero. To measure the closeness\nof \u016a (X) to U , we compute a power series expansion of\n(Tr(X * U \u2020 \u016a (X) ), Tr(Y * U \u2020 \u016a (X) ), Tr(Z * U \u2020 \u016a (X) )). We\nobtain\n\u221a\n(2i\u01ebx \u2212 i 3(\u01eb2y + \u01eb2z ) + O(|~\u01eb|3 ),\n2i\u01eb3y + 2i\u01eby \u01eb2z + O(|~\u01eb|5 ),\n\n2i\u01eb3z + 2i\u01ebz \u01eb2y + O(|~\u01eb|5 )).\n\nThe first term is first order in \u01ebx because our correction\nR0 is a rotation about the x axis, and commutes with errors in the X direction. Errors in the Y and Z directions\nare symmetrically cancelled out, leaving only third-order\nterms.\nWe can express this result quite simply. Assume \u01ebx,y,z\nis an a, b, cth order term. Then the X direction error\norder after the X direction composite pulse correction is\napplied is min{a, 2b, 2c}, the Y direction error order is\nmin{3b, b + 2c} and symmetrically for the Z error. In\nshorthand, we write\n(a; b; c) \u2192 (a, 2b, 2c; 3b, b + 2c; 3c, c + 2b).\nX\n\n(2)\n\nThe underset X here refers to X correction, and it is understood that we take a minimum on each of the three\nterms on the right. This notation lets us quickly understand what happens when we concatenate correction\nsequences. To concatenate when \u03c0/3 pulses are perfect, just substitute the previous level's composite pulse\nsequence for \u016a . A level k concatenation will require\nnk = 3nk\u22121 + 4 pulses, so the sequence length grows like\n4k . For example, starting with only first-order Z error,\nand applying an X correction gives\n(\u221e; \u221e; 1) \u2192 (2; \u221e; 3).\nX\n\nAt this point, it is best to apply a Y correction, since that\ncancels out errors in both X and Z directions. (Y correction is symmetrical to X correction, except with \u03c0/3\nrotations about the y axis and the same axis conjugated\nby U .) At the next level of concatenation, Z correction\nwill be optimal, and so on:\n(\u221e; \u221e; 1) \u2192 (2; \u221e; 3) \u2192 (6; 4; 7)\nX\n\nII.\n\nPERFECT \u03c0/3 PULSES\n\nZ\n\nIt is instructive to start with just the core idea of our\ncomposite pulse sequence, and build up the analysis from\nthere. Consider the sequence\n\u016a (X) = R\u0304t\u2020 \u016a R\u03040 \u016a \u2020 R\u0304t \u016a R\u03040\u2020 = U R\u03030\u2020 V R\u03040 V \u2020 R\u03030 V R0\u2020 ,\n\u2020\n\nY\n\n\u2192 (14; 12; 7) \u2192 (14; 26; 21)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere again V \u2261 U \u016a .

The question of whether\nthis pulse sequence generalizes deserves further study.\nWe have been able to find a pulse sequence with five\n\n\f3\napplications of \u016a or \u016a \u2020 , and perfect rotations by \u03c0/5\nor 3\u03c0/5, which on input |\u00b1i \u2261 \u221a12 (|0i \u00b1 |1i) achieves a\nfidelity error of O(\u01eb10 ):\n\u2020\n\u2020\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n3\u03c0\n|h\u00b1|U \u2020 \u016a R0 ( 3\u03c0\n5 )\u016a Rt (\u2212 5 )\u016a R0 (\u2212 5 )\u016a Rt ( 5 )\u016a |\u00b1i|\n\n= 1 \u2212 O(\u01eb10 ). (4)\n\n(See Fig. 1 for geometrical intuition.) However, this sequence gives no improvement with imperfect correction\nrotations.\nRemark 2 (Error measurement). For us it is key\nto measure the direction of the error, as well as its\nmagnitude. How does our method of measuring error\ncompare to other reasonable methods? On a particular input state, the difference in the fidelity from one is\nquadratically smaller than our measure. The so-called\ninfidelity between U and \u016a \u22c6 , or 1 \u2212 12 |Tr U \u2020 \u016a \u22c6 | is used in\n[3, 7, 8],and is also quadratically smaller than our measure. Brown et al [2] use as their measure of distance the\ntrace distance Tr|U \u2212 \u016a \u22c6 |, which depends on the global\nphase of the operators. Our correction sequence does\nnot give higher order accuracy in the global phase, but a\nsimple modification of the trace distance optimizes over\nglobal phases, and then this measure of error is of the\nsame order as ours.\n\nIII. IMPERFECT \u03c0/3 PULSES, ERROR\nANGLE-DEPENDENT & AXIS-INDEPENDENT\n\nLet us consider the more realistic case that the \u03c0/3\npulses are themselves erroneous. Assume that the error\nin a rotation depends only on the rotation angle, not on\nthe rotation axis. When we attempt to apply exp(i\u03b8n\u0302*~\u03c3 ),\nwe actually apply exp{i[\u03b8 + \u01eb(\u03b8)]n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 }. Here \u01eb(\u03b8) can be\nan arbitrary function of \u03b8, which is however always small\n[order O(|\u01eb|)]. The error amount does not depend on the\nrotation axis n\u0302. Previous work has only considered the\nless-general case of linear errors, \u01eb(\u03b8) = \u01eb\u03b8.\nIn fact, let us generalize our calculations slightly further. We will allow errors in the \u03c0/3 pulses besides\njust over-rotation errors, except these errors must be the\nsame under change of coordinates by U . In particular,\nR\u0304t = U R\u03040 U \u2020 . It isn't clear in what physical models this\nwill be an appropriate base error assumption \u2013 perhaps\none in which the entire apparatus for applying a \u03c0/3 rotation is rotated about the qubit in three dimensions as\nU acts in R3 , or equivalently, the qubit is physically rotated. However, the added generality will be necessary\nfor considering concatenation of this correction sequence.\nWrite R\u03040 = R0 exp(i~\u03b4 * ~\u03c3 ).

Note that we do not concatenate corrections onto the \u03c0/3 pulses, because then the\nerror would no longer be simply over-rotational. (Even\nwith a more general expansion, it turns out that the convergence is still only be linear in the number of concatenation levels.)\nV.\n\n\u03c0 PULSES IN NMR\n\nWhile our method corrects against more general types\nof errors than previous composite pulse sequences, it also\nhas a stronger requirement. Namely, we must be able to\napply a \u03c0/3 rotation about the x, y and z axes, and also\nabout those same axes in the U -transformed basis. In\nmost current proposed quantum information implementations, primitive rotations are only allowed about axes\nin the xy plane. For U , Rt and R0 all to be rotations\nabout axes in the xy plane, it must be that U is a rotation by an integer multiple of \u03c0. This is a considerable\nrestriction on the applicability of our method. Still, for \u03c0\npulses our correction succeeds in a setting more general\nthan that for which previous methods could correct; for\nexample, we can correct for non-linear over-rotations.\nAssume now that the systematic error is in fact a linear\nover-rotation; when we try to apply exp(i\u03b8n\u0302*~\u03c3 ), we actually apply exp[i\u03b8(1+\u01eb)n\u0302*~\u03c3 ]. Assume U = exp(i \u03c02 X) = X.\nOur \u03c0/3 correction method, correcting in the Y direction,\nleaves behind second-order errors, with a sequence length\nof 3\u03c0 + 4\u03c0/3. (Practical composite pulse sequences need\nto be as short as possible, in order to minimize any nonideal effects not accounted for in our error model.) We\ncannot concatenate a Z correction, but can concatenate\n\nalternately X and Y corrections to reduce the error arbitrarily. Concatenating an X correction onto the Y correction leaves behind a third-order error, with a sequence\nlength of (1413 )\u03c0.\nHow does the \u03c0/3 correction method compare with\nprevious correction methods? The most practical correction methods previously known were the B2 (also known\nas BB1) correction sequence, and the recently discovered\nB4 sequence [2]. These sequences are implemented as\nfollows:\n\u0001\n(10)\nB2:\nR\u0304\u03c61 (\u03c0)R\u03043\u03c61 (2\u03c0)R\u0304\u03c61 (\u03c0) \u016a\n\uf8eb\n4\uf8f6\n(R\u0304\u03c62 (\u03c0)R\u03043\u03c62 (2\u03c0)R\u0304\u03c62 (\u03c0))\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nB4: \uf8ed \u00d7(R\u0304\u03c62 (\u22122\u03c0)R\u0304\u2212\u03c62 (\u22124\u03c0)R\u0304\u03c62 (\u22122\u03c0))\uf8f8 \u016a , (11)\n\u00d7(R\u0304\u03c62 (\u03c0)R\u03043\u03c62 (2\u03c0)R\u0304\u03c62 (\u03c0))4\n\nwhere R\u0304\u03c6 (\u03b8) \u2261 exp(i \u03b8(1+\u01eb)\n(cos \u03c6X + sin \u03c6Y )), cos \u03c61 =\n2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u2212 4\u03c0\n, and cos \u03c62 = \u2212 24\u03c0\n. They leave behind third- and\nfifth-order errors, respectively. The total sequence length\nfor correcting a \u03c0 rotation is 5\u03c0 for B2 and 41\u03c0 for\nB4. Hence our method, in this linear over-rotation error\nmodel, seems to offer little over the plain B2 sequence.\nTable I gives values for the infidelities 1\u2212 12 |Tr U \u2020 \u016a (\u2217) | for\nvarious correction sequences. (As previously remarked,\nthe infidelity is quadratically smaller than the trace distance, so the infidelity error orders for the three possibilities \u03c0/3 Y , B2 and B4 are 4, 6 and 10, respectively.)\nDoes our method complement previous correction\nmethods? To answer this question, we must determine\nthe direction of the error left behind after a correction sequence. For example, B2 and B4 are each implemented as\nBi\u016a , where Bi is some particular pulse sequence not involving \u016a . A simple calculation shows that both B2 and\nB4 leave behind an error which is has relatively large X\nand Y components. Therefore, concatenating on X or Y\ncorrection will not increase the error order. We can however find an axis in the xy plane which is approximately\n\n\f5\northogonal to the xy component of the error, and correct\nalong this axis. Alternatively, we can symmetrize the B2\nand B4 sequences into exp[i \u03c04 (1+\u01eb)X]Bi exp[i \u03c04 (1+\u01eb)X].\nIn this more symmetrical form, the error magnitude is unchanged, but the direction is entirely into the xz plane.\nTherefore, we can simply apply a Y correction to the\nsymmetrized sequences. Table I compares the infidelities\nof Y correction concatenated onto the symmetrized B2\nand B4 correction sequences. Note that the former case\ngives fourth-order protection with a sequence length of\nonly (1613 )\u03c0; this gives a new, perhaps practical, compromise between the B2 and B4 correction sequences.\nFigure 2 plots the fidelities for \u01eb > 0.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented two main results. The \u03c0/3 correction sequence protects against general errors which\ndepend arbitrarily on the rotation angle but not the\n\n[1] J.

In\nthe first case, the overhead number of pulses is polylogarithmic in the desired accuracy, and in the second\ncase the overhead is polynomial.\nHowever, our correction sequence in general requires\nprimitive rotations about arbitrary axes in the Bloch\nsphere, and only applies to correct \u03c0 pulses in the typical situation in which rotations are only allowed about\naxes in the xy plane. For correcting \u03c0 pulses, our method\nconcatenated on top of a B2 pulse correction provides a\nnew compromise between B2 and B4.\nB.
