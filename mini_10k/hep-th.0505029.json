These backgrounds contain wrapped\nbranes at Calabi-Yau singularites with obstructions to deformation of the complex\nstructure. We motivate our conjecture with a particular example: the Y 2,1 quiver\ngauge theory corresponding to a cone over the first del Pezzo surface, dP1 . This setup\ncan be analyzed using ordinary supersymmetric field theory methods, where we find\nthat gaugino condensation drives a deformation of the chiral ring which has no solutions. We expect this breaking to be a general feature of any theory of branes at a\nsingularity with a smaller number of possible deformations than independent anomalyfree fractional branes.\n\nMay 2005\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSupersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking are central ideas both in contemporary particle physics and in mathematical physics. In this paper, we argue that for a large new\nclass of D-brane models there exists a simple geometric criterion which determines whether\nsupersymmetry breaking occurs.\nThe models of interest are based on Calabi-Yau singularities with D-branes placed at or\nnear the singularity. By taking a large volume limit, it is possible to decouple gravity from\nthe theory, and ignore the Calabi-Yau geometry far from the branes. Although one typically\nbegins the construction with branes free to move throughout the Calabi-Yau space, many\ninteresting theories include fractional branes (or wrapped branes), which are D-branes stuck\nat the singularity and which cannot move away from it. These fractional branes can lead\nto topology changes in the geometry via gaugino condensation, which can be understood\nin terms of deformations of the complex structure of the Calabi-Yau singularity, and result\nin the replacement of branes by fluxes [1, 2]. Models of this type, Calabi-Yau geometries\nwith fluxes, are among the ingredients used to construct viable cosmological models within\nstring theory with a positive cosmological constant [3], and which, because of that positivity,\nultimately break supersymmetry. With current approaches in the literature, the issue of\nwhether or not supersymmetry breaking is under control is controversial.\nIt turns out that there exist some singular geometries which admit fractional branes, but\nfor which the associated complex structure deformations are obstructed. We will argue that\nin such setups a deformation can still take place, but that the geometric obstruction induces\nsupersymmetry breaking.\nConjecture. Given a set of ordinary and fractional branes probing a Calabi-Yau singularity,\nsupersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometry (SUSY-BOG) occurs when the singularity\nadmits fewer deformations than the number of (anomaly free) independent fractional branes\nthat one can add to the system.\nIn this paper we will show how this breaking occurs in one particular example, D-branes\nprobing the singularity of the Calabi-Yau cone over the first del Pezzo surface, dP1 . This\ncase can be analyzed using the gauge theory/gravity correspondence. In field theory, the\nmechanism that spontaneously breaks SUSY is simply gaugino condensation. In terms of the\ndual gravity theory and its local Calabi-Yau geometry, the deformation obstruction causes\nthe breaking. The SUSY-BOG adds a new feature to the string theory landscape.\ndP1 belongs to a large class of singularities for which this geometric obstruction is easy\nto understand. We need the technical concept from algebraic geometry of a singularity\nwhich is an \"incomplete intersection variety.\" These varieties are described by n equations\nin m variables, where the dimension of the variety is strictly greater than m \u2212 n. Although\n1\n\n\fthe n equations or relations are redundant, it is impossible to reduce the number of equations further without changing the geometry. In the case of an incomplete intersection, the\nredundancy makes it hard to deform the equations consistently, giving an obstruction to\ndeformation. These incomplete intersections are believed to be more generic than \"complete\nintersections,\" where the dimension of the variety is equal to m \u2212 n.\nIn the dual field theory, the m complex variables can be associated to generators of the\nchiral ring of the theory, while the relations in the geometry can be understood as relations\nin the chiral ring. We will develop this picture further to make this set of ideas more precise.\nA generic property of fractional branes is that they have gaugino condensation on their\nworldvolume, which translates to non-trivial deformed relations in the chiral ring of the field\ntheory. When it is possible to deform the equations of the chiral ring consistently, the field\ntheory realizes a supersymmetric vacuum. If it is impossible to deform the equations in the\nchiral ring consistently, then the theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry.\n\n1.1\n\nThe Conifold vs. dP1\n\nPerhaps the prototypical example of a Calabi-Yau singularity with fractional branes is the\nconifold singularity, in the setups of Klebanov and Witten [4] (see also [5, 6]), and its generalization to the warped deformed conifold geometry of Klebanov and Strassler (KS) [1]. The\nKS solution is an example of a space with no obstruction to deformation, and in this case\nchiral symmetry breaking and confinement in the strongly coupled dual gauge theory may\nbe identified with the deformation in a precise way.\nRecall that the construction of the KS solution begins by placing a stack of N D3-branes\nand M D5-branes at the tip of the conifold:\n4\nX\n\nzi2 = 0 .\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nThe D5-branes are fractional. In the supergravity solution, the D-branes are replaced by their\ncorresponding RR five-form and three-form fluxes. The three-form flux from the D5-branes\nleads to a singularity unless the conifold is deformed:\n4\nX\n\nzi2 = \u01eb .\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nThis \u01eb parameter is interpreted as a gaugino condensate in the dual theory and breaks the\nR-symmetry to Z2 . Moreover, cutting off the cone at a radius \u01eb produces confining behavior\nof strings in this geometry which are dual to electric flux tubes in the gauge theory.\nNaively, one could imagine that a very similar phenomenon occurs for the cone over dP1 ,\nbut there is an obstruction. A theorem by Altmann [7] claims that there are no deformations\n2\n\n\fof this cone. While the conifold has the single defining equation (1), we recall below that\nthe cone over dP1 requires twenty algebraic relations in C9 which are not all independent. It\nis impossible to alter all twenty consistently by adding the analog of \u01eb in (2).\nThe conformal analog of the dP1 model with no D5-branes was first proposed separately\nby Kehagias [6] and by Morrison and Plesser [5] as an example of a generalized AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. Type IIB string theory propagating in AdS5 \u00d7 Y , where Y is a particular\nU(1) bundle over dP1 , is equivalent to a superconformal N = 1 gauge theory whose field\ncontent and superpotential were later derived in [8] using techniques from toric geometry\n(see Fig. 1).\nRecently, the metric on Y was discovered. Martelli and Sparks [9] have shown that this\nU(1) bundle over dP1 , Y = Y 2,1 , is a particular example of the Y p,q Sasaki-Einstein manifolds\nfound in [10, 11]. Using the explicit metric, impressive comparisons of the conformal anomaly\ncoefficients and R-charges between the AdS and the CFT sides were carried out for dP1 in\n[12, 13].\nAs was the case for the conifold, adding D5-branes to the tip of the cone over dP1 breaks\nconformal invariance and leads to a cascading gauge theory [14, 15]. Recently, a supergravity\nsolution dual to this cascading theory was derived by Herzog, Ejaz, and Klebanov (HEK)\n[16]. The HEK solution shares many of the features of the predecessor of the KS solution, the\nKlebanov-Tseytlin (KT) solution [17]. Like the KT solution, the HEK solution is singular\nin the infrared (small radius); at large radius, in the ultraviolet, the KT solution approaches\nthe KS solution. The large radius region can be used to calculate geometrically the NSVZ\nbeta functions and logarithmic running in the number of colors, and this geometric behavior\nmatches our field theoretic understanding of a duality cascade.\nHowever, there currently is no known analog of the KS solution for dP1 that smooths\nthe singularity in the infrared. The motivation behind this research was to understand the\ninfrared physics of dP1 .\n\n1.2\n\nSummary of the dP1 Argument\n\nSince the Calabi-Yau deformations are obstructed, we argue that supersymmetry is broken\nat the bottom of the duality cascade for dP1 . Our argument has three field theoretic legs.\nFirst we argue that there is no superconformal fixed point to which the cascading theory\nmay flow, ruling out strong coupling behavior that is not confinement. Next, turning on\nFayet-Iliopoulos terms in the field theory, we show that the theory should confine in the\ninfrared. Last, using the Konishi anomaly [18], we show there are no solutions to the F-term\nequations.\nThe last step requires some immediate clarification. The field theory analysis is well\n3\n\n\fsuited for studying vacua where mesonic operators get expectation values \u2013 the mesonic\nbranch \u2013 and is less so for the baryonic branch. We will show that the mesonic branch of\nthe dP1 field theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry.\nWe have a traditional field theory argument that supersymmetry is not preserved along\nthe baryonic branch, but the argument is not as rigorous as the Konishi anomaly approach.\nIt may be that there exists a supersymmetric, pure flux supergravity solution (which does not\ninvolve a Calabi-Yau manifold), similar to the recent SU(3) structure solutions of [19, 20].\nRecall that the KS solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch of the conifold\nfield theory [21]. As one moves along the baryonic branch, one finds that the geometry is no\nlonger Calabi-Yau but is instead an SU(3) structure solution where probe D3-branes break\nsupersymmetry.\nFor generic initial number of D3- and D5-branes in the UV, we expect to have left-over\nD3-branes at the bottom of the cascade. The KS solution represents a particular point\nin the baryonic branch where these D3-branes will remain supersymmetric. However, even\nif there is an SU(3) structure solution for dP1 , the left-over D3-branes will always break\nsupersymmetry.\nWe emphasize that the supersymmetry breaking is an infrared effect. The warp factor\nin the geometry will lead to an exponential separation between the ultraviolet and infrared\nscales, giving a natural way of achieving low-scale supersymmetry breaking should we embed\nthis cone over dP1 in a compact Calabi-Yau. An optimistic point of view is that one might\nbe able to build supergravity solutions from compactified versions of this cone over dP1 , and\nusing these solutions, produce realistic cosmological models similar to [3] where all stringy\nmoduli are stabilized and supersymmetry is broken in a controlled way. Such solutions\ndeserve further study.\n\n2\n\nThe Gauge Theory for dP1\n\nThe quiver theory for the first del Pezzo has four gauge groups and a number of bifundamental\nfields conveniently summarized using a quiver diagram (see Fig. 1). The superpotential for\nthe first del Pezzo takes the form\nW = \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 UL\u03b1 V \u03b2 Y1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 UR\u03b1 Y2 V \u03b2 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 UL\u03b1 Y3 UR\u03b2 Z .\n\n(3)\n\nThere is an SU(2) global symmetry: the indices \u03b1 and \u03b2 are either one or two and \u01eb12 = 1.\nIn the case M = 0, the gauge theory has a superconformal fixed point with an AdS/CFT\ndual description: type IIB string theory in a AdS5 \u00d7 Y 2,1 background. Adding M D5-branes\nbreaks the superconformal symmetry and starts a Seiberg duality cascade, as argued in\n[14, 15, 16]. In the limit M \u226a N, we can calculate the NSVZ \u03b2-functions and find that\n4\n\n\fZ\n\nSU(N)\n\nSU(N+3M)\n\nY2\n\nY1\n\nUL\n\nSU(N+2M)\n\nUR\n\nSU(N+M)\n\nV , Y3\n\nFigure 1: The quiver theory for Y 2,1 , also known as an irregular U(1) fibration of P2 blown\nup at a point.\ngenerically the SU(N +3M) group runs to strong coupling first as the energy scale decreases.\nTaking the Seiberg dual of the SU(N + 3M) group yields the same quiver and superpotential\nbut with N \u2192 N \u2212 M, i.e. the number of D3-branes slowly decreases with energy scale.\nBefore tackling the problem of what happens when N becomes of order M, we would like\nto demonstrate how the geometry of the first del Pezzo can be recovered from the F-term\nrelations of this gauge theory.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Chiral Ring\n\nThe superpotential (3) gives rise to the ten classical F-term equations\n\u2202W\n=0,\n\u2202Xi\n\n(4)\n\none for each Xi , where Xi = UL\u03b1 , UR\u03b1 , V \u03b1 , Yj , or Z. We list these ten equations:\nUL1 V 2 = UL2 V 1 ,\n1\n\nV UR2\nUR1 ZUL2\nUL1 Y3 UR2\nV \u03b2 Y1\n\n= V\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u03b2\n\n=\n\nY1 UL\u03b2\n\n=\n\nY2 V\n\n2\n\nUR1\n\n,\n\nUR2 ZUL1 ,\nUL2 Y3 UR1 ,\nY3 UR\u03b2 Z ,\nZUL\u03b2 Y3 ,\nUR\u03b2 Y2 .\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nTo see the geometry emerge from the F-term equations, we study the spectrum of chiral\n5\n\n\fprimary operators of the schematic form\nO = tr (Xi1 Xi2 Xi3 . . . Xin ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we contract all of the color indices to form a gauge invariant operator. The trace\nstructure means that these gauge invariant operators will correspond to loops in the quiver\ndiagram.\nThe reason this expression (12) is schematic is that the actual chiral primary operator\nwill be a polynomial of such traces. The traces generate the chiral ring. Just as we think of\nharmonic forms as representatives of classes in cohomology, we can think of a chiral primary\noperator as a representative of a class of operators related by the F-term equations. By only\ngiving a single trace, we are really specifying a class of such operators related to each other\nby the F-term equations.\nThere are six types of operators that loop just once around the quiver\nUR\u03b1 Y2 Y3 ;\n\nUR\u03b1 Y2 V \u03b2 ;\n\nY1 UL\u03b1 Y3 ;\n\nY1 UL\u03b1 V \u03b2 ;\n\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 V \u03b3 .\n\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 ;\n\n(13)\n\nFrom these six building blocks, we can form any operator of the form (12). The final trace\nwill always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver.\nNow of these six building blocks, only three are independent. Note that from (11),\n= Y1 UL\u03b1 Y3 and that UR\u03b1 Y2 V \u03b2 = Y1 UL\u03b1 V \u03b2 . Moreover, under (10), UR\u03b1 Y2 V \u03b2 = UR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 .\nWe will choose the three independent blocks\nUR\u03b1 Y2 Y3\n\nUR\u03b1 Y2 Y3 ;\n\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 ;\n\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 V \u03b3 .\n\n(14)\n\nThese blocks satisfy some additional important relations. They are symmetric under\ninterchange of their SU(2) indices. From (7), we see that UR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 = UR\u03b2 ZUL\u03b1 Y3 . Moreover,\nfrom (7) and (5), we see that\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 V \u03b3 = UR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b3 V \u03b2 = UR\u03b3 ZUL\u03b1 V \u03b2 .\n\n(15)\n\nWe now study what happens when we assemble these blocks into larger operators. We\nfind that\nUR\u03b1 Y2 Y3 * UR\u03b2 ZUL\u03b3 V \u03b4 = UR\u03b1 Y2 V \u03b2 Y1 UL\u03b3 V \u03b4\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 UR\u03b3 Y2 V \u03b4\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 * UR\u03b3 ZUL\u03b4 Y3\n\n=\n=\n6\n\n(16)\n.\n\n\fThe * has been added as a guide to the eye. Similar types of manipulation reveal also that\nthese blocks commute with one another. In particular\nUR\u03b1 Y2 Y3 * UR\u03b2 ZUL\u03b3 Y3 = UR\u03b2 ZUL\u03b3 Y3 * UR\u03b1 Y2 Y3 ,\n\n(17)\n\nUR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 * UR\u03b3 ZUL\u03b4 V \u01eb = UR\u03b3 ZUL\u03b4 V \u01eb * UR\u03b1 ZUL\u03b2 Y3 .\n\n(18)\n\nand that\nFinally, with a little more work, one can show that any product of the (14) is symmetric in\nthe SU(2) indices.\nFrom these assembled facts, we conclude that the most general operator of the form (12)\ntakes the schematic form\n!\nn\nm\nY\nY\n\u03b3\ntr\n(UR\u03b1i ZUL\u03b2i Y3 ) (URj Y2 Y3 )\n(19)\ni=1\n\nor\n\nj=1\n\nm\nn\nY\nY\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\n\u03b2i\n\u03b1i\n(UR ZUL Y3 ) (URj ZULj V \u01ebj )\ntr\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nThese operators are understood to be totally symmetric in the SU(2) indices. The first\noperator transforms in a 2n + m + 1 dimensional representation of SU(2) while the second\ntransforms in a 2n + 3m + 1 dimensional representation.1\nAt this point, it is convenient to introduce some new notation for the building blocks\n(14):\nc1 = UR1 ZUL1 V 1\n1\n1\nb\n=\nU\nZU\nY\n1\n3\nR\nL\nc2 = UR1 ZUL1 V 2\na1 = UR1 Y2 Y3\n1\n2\n,\n,\n.\n(21)\nb\n=\nU\nZU\nY\n2\n3\nR\nL\na2 = UR2 Y2 Y3\nc3 = UR1 ZUL2 V 2\n2\n2\nb3 = UR ZUL Y3\nc4 = UR2 ZUL2 V 2\nFrom these nine operators, which we can treat as commuting, we can construct any\noperator of the form (19) or (20) subject to some relations. In particular, we know that the\nresulting operator must be totally symmetric in the SU(2) indices and moreover an a and\nc type operator annihilate to form two b operators (16). The set of twenty relations these\noperators satisfy is given in Appendix A.\nWe can find a set of monomials with identical algebraic properties. In particular, we let\n1\n\nIn the case M = 0, there is a superconformal symmetry and we can assign R-charges to these elements of\nthe chiral ring. The R-charge of (19) is 2n+m(RU +2RY ) while the R-charge of (20) is 2n+m(2RU +RZ +RV ).\nWe will recalculate these charges in the appendix directly from the metric.\n\n7\n\n\fx, y, z \u2208 C and\nc1\nb1 = xy 2\n2\nc2\na1 = x y\n2 , b2 = xyz ,\nc3\na2 = x z\nb3 = xz 2\nc4\n\n= y3\n= y2z\n.\n= yz 2\n= z3\n\n(22)\n\nIn this way, the operators commute by construction and the number of x's labels whether\nthe operator is of type a, b, or c. The number of y's equals the number of SU(2) indices\nset to one while the number of z's equals the number of SU(2) indices set to two. In any\nproduct of the a, b, and c, the fact that the x, y, and z commute is equivalent to the fact\nthat the operator is totally symmetric in the SU(2) indices. Only slightly more difficult to\nsee is (16).\nBecause the ai , bj and ck commute, one can diagonalize all of these matrix valued operators simultaneously. Eigenvalue by eigenvalue, these operators describe a three dimensional\nvariety, parametrized above by x, y, z. This variety is the Calabi-Yau geometry we are interested in. The description of a general point in the moduli space is a set of N unordered\npoints of the Calabi-Yau geometry. We call this moduli space the mesonic branch of the\ntheory. That we have found a Calabi-Yau in this way is in line with the expectations of\nreverse geometric engineering [22].\nNow, treating x, y, and z as homogenous coordinates on P2 , this set of monomials can be\nreinterpreted as a set of linearly independent polynomials on P2 which vanish at the point\n(1, 0, 0) \u223c (\u03bb, 0, 0) for \u03bb \u2208 C\u2217 . This set of monomials then provides a map from P2 \u2192 P8 with\nthe point (1, 0, 0) missing because the origin is not contained in P8 . The smallest surface\ncontaining the image of this map is well known to be the first del Pezzo, or P2 blown up at\na point.\n\n2.2\n\nThe First del Pezzo\n\nWe can be more precise in our description of this first del Pezzo. It is easy to embed P2\nblown up at a point inside P2 \u00d7 P1 . Let x, y, and z be homogenous coordinates on the P2 ,\nas above, and let w1 and w2 be coordinates on the P1 . The first del Pezzo is described as\nthe hypersurface dP1 \u2282 P2 \u00d7 P1 satisfying yw2 = zw1 .\nWe now construct a map from P2 \u00d7 P1 to P11 by considering all monomials linear in the\nwi and quadratic in the x, y, and z. (Algebraic geometers would call this map a composition\nof the Segre and Veronese maps.)\nP2 \u00d7 P1 \u2212\u2192 P11\n(x, y, z; w1, w2 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (x2 w1 , xyw1 , xzw1 , y 2w1 , yzw1 , z 2 w1 ,\nx2 w2 , xyw2 , xzw2 , y 2w2 , yzw2 , z 2 w2 )\n8\n\n\fThis map restricts to an injective map from dP1 to P8 by requiring yw2 = zw1 \u2013 of the twelve\nmonomials above, only nine are linearly independent under this relation.\nNow for a point on dP1 where y and z do not both vanish, the constraint yw2 = zw1\nfixes a point on the P1 which we can take to be w2 = z and w1 = y. In this case, the twelve\nmonomials in P11 reduce precisely to the nine monomials given as (22). Thus this dP1 \u2282 P8\ncertainly contains the image of the map described above from P2 \u2192 P8 .\nUsing the twelve monomials that depend on the wi , we can also describe the extra blown\nup P1 in dP1 . Consider the case y = 0 and z = 0. Now, the wi are unconstrained, and\nthe only two nonvanishing monomials in the P11 are x2 w1 and x2 w2 , which parametrize the\nblown up P1 .\nNaively, this description of the first del Pezzo seems overly complicated. For example,\nwe may just as easily consider the simpler Segre map to P5 :\nP2 \u00d7 P1 \u2212\u2192 P5\n(x, y, z; w1, w2 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (xw1 , yw1, zw1 , xw2 , yw2, zw2 )\nSubject to the relation yw2 = zw1 we have a simpler embedding of the first del Pezzo\ninside P4 . However, we are not just describing the geometry of the Del-Pezzo surface, but\na particular algebraic cone over it, which results from blowing down the zero section of the\ntotal space of a line bundle over dP1 which makes the space a Calabi-Yau geometry.\n\n3\n\nD5-branes and Superconformal Fixed Points\n\nWe will now give a plausible argument that the field theory on a stack of D3-branes and D5branes probing a dP1 singularity does not have a superconformal fixed point in the infrared.\nThis absence helps rule out strong coupling behaviors in the IR field theory which are not\ngaugino condensation.\nA necessary condition for the presence of a superconformal fixed point in a gauge theory\nis the vanishing of the NSVZ beta functions and the requirement that the superpotential\nbe marginal. We will assume that there is an SU(2) global symmetry. As a result, the\nanomalous dimensions of the doublet fields will be equal, \u03b3V 1 = \u03b3V 2 and similarly for the UL\nand UR . Moreover, because of this SU(2), there will only be three independent superpotential\ncouplings.\nWe find it convenient to work with R-charges rather than with the anomalous dimensions\n\u03b3. Recall that at a superconformal fixed point, the supersymmetry algebra implies that\n3R = 2 + \u03b3.\n\n9\n\n\fFor the NSVZ beta functions to vanish, the following expressions must vanish:\n\u03b20 = 2N + (N + 3M)(RZ \u2212 1) + (N + M)(RY1 \u2212 1) + 2(N + 2M)(RUL \u2212 1) ,\n\u03b21 = 2(N + M) + (N + 2M)(RY3 \u2212 1) + 2(N + 2M)(RV \u2212 1) +\nN(RY1 \u2212 1) + 2(N + 3M)(RUR \u2212 1) ,\n\u03b22 = 2(N + 2M) + (N + M)(RY3 \u2212 1) + 2(N + M)(RV \u2212 1) +\n(N + 3M)(RY2 \u2212 1) + 2N(RUL \u2212 1) ,\n\u03b23 = 2(N + 3M) + N(RZ \u2212 1) + (N + 2M)(RY2 \u2212 1) + 2(N + M)(RUR \u2212 1) .\nMoreover, the superpotential couplings must be marginal, which implies that each of the bi\nhave R-charge two:\n2 = RUL + RY1 + RV\n2 = RUR + RY2 + RV ,\n2 = RZ + RUR + RY3 + RUL .\nThis set of seven equations is not linearly independent. In the case M = 0, there is a two\nparameter family of solutions. In the case M 6= 0, there is just a one parameter family.\nHowever, the existence of a family of solutions to these beta function constraints is not\nsufficient to guarantee the existence of a superconformal fixed point. From Intriligator and\nWecht [23], we know that at a superconformal fixed point, the conformal anomaly a \u223c TrR3\nshould be at a local maximum. Here, TrR3 is a trace over the R-charges of all of the fermions\nin the gauge theory. For the M = 0 case, it is indeed possible to maximize a over the two\nparameter family of solutions, and one can match the results to geometric expectations\n[9, 12, 13]. However, in the case M 6= 0, a cannot be maximized. If we let RV parametrize\nthe family of solutions to the beta function constraints, it is straightforward to see that\ntrR3 = 24(\u221219M 2 \u2212 27MN \u2212 9N 2 + (M + N)(2M + N)RV )\n\n(23)\n\nis a linear function in R.\nIn fact, one can see the pathology in the M 6= 0 case even before computing a. The\nR-charges of the ai , bj and ck operators of the previous section do not depend on RV . One\nfinds that Rck = 6 while Rai = \u22122. In other words, a finite fraction of operators in the chiral\nring \u2013 those with enough of the ai as building blocks \u2013 will have a conformal dimension below\nthe unitarity bound.\nSuch a pheonomenon has been encountered before studying simpler SQCD like gauge\ntheories [24, 25] where it was argued that accidental U(1) symmetries emerge in the infrared\nwhich decouple these troublesome operators from the theory once their dimension reaches the\nunitarity bound. However, in these simpler cases, there was a finite number of such operators\n10\n\n\fand there was also a well defined ultraviolet where the theory became asymptotically free.\nWe have an infinite number of troublesome operators, and truncating them from the theory\nwill radically change the geometry.\nA simpler and we believe more probable resolution to this pair of problems \u2013 an inability\nto maximize a and an infinite set of operators below the unitarity bound \u2013 is that the\ncorresponding superconformal fixed point does not exist.\nAt the beginning, we assumed an SU(2) symmetry. If we allow this SU(2) to be broken,\nwe can maximize a but there will still be an infinite number of operators with negative\nconformal dimension.\n\n4\n\nThe Quantum Moduli Space\n\nWe begin by analyzing the theory with no D3-branes and N D5-branes. Such a gauge theory\ncan be thought of as the last step in the Seiberg duality cascade, starting in the UV with a\nmultiple nN of D3-branes. Starting with the pure D5-brane theory precludes the possibility\nof a baryonic branch, a possibility we will return to later.\nThe pure D5-brane gauge theory has gauge group U(3N) \u00d7 U(2N) \u00d7 U(N) and classical\nsuperpotential\nW = UR2 Y2 V 1 \u2212 UR1 Y2 V 2 .\n(24)\nWe will keep the SU(2) global symmetry, and thus single loops involving the Y3 field cannot\nappear in the superpotential. Most aspects of our analysis are standard in the study of\nN = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories. See [26] for a selection of relevant reviews.\nFirst, we argue that confinement and gluino condensation occur at low energies in our\ngauge theory. Because these gauge groups are U(N), they will have three decoupled U(1)\nsubgroups, some of which allow the addition of Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms.2 Suppose we\nadd an FI term \u03ba for the U(1) \u2282 U(2N). For the purposes of this argument we take \u03ba to\nbe large compared to other scales in the problem and temporarily ignore the superpotential.\nThe relevant piece of the classical K\u00e4hler potential for the gauge theory is\n(\u03ba + V 1 (V 1 )\u2020 + V 2 (V 2 )\u2020 + Y3 Y3\u2020 \u2212 Y2 Y2\u2020 ) .\n2\n\n(25)\n\nAn FI term for the U (3N ) group is forbidden. When we write out the full matrix structure of the D-term\nequations, the D-term equation for the U (3N ) gauge group is of the form \u03b6\u03b4ji = (Y2 )ia (Y2\u2020 )aj \u2212 (UR\u03b1\u2020 )im (UR\u03b1 )m\nj\nwith the Y2 field contracted on its U (2N ) indices and the UR fields contracted on their U (N ) indices. For\npositive (negative) \u03b6 we may consider giving Y2 (UR ) an expectation value independent of the other field. But\nby applying gauge rotations to this field it is always possible to eliminate components of the field such that\nthe contracted form is diagonal and nonvanishing only on 2M of its 3M diagonal components, inconsistent\nwith the D-term equations.\n\n11\n\n\fFor negative \u03ba we may give expectation values to V 1 and V 2 .\nNow, consider the D-term equation associated with the U(N) gauge group:\n(\u03b6 + UR1 (UR1 )\u2020 + UR2 (UR2 )\u2020 \u2212 V 1 (V 1 )\u2020 \u2212 V 2 (V 2 )\u2020 \u2212 Y3 Y3\u2020 ) .\n\n(26)\n\nWe choose the FI term \u03b6 = \u22122\u03ba and set the expectation values of UR\u03b1 and Y2 , Y3 equal to\nzero.\nTurning now to the superpotential, we see that the large expectation values for the V \u03b1\ngive large masses to the UR\u03b1 and Y2 superfields, which we may then integrate out. But after\nintegrating out these fields, we see that the U(3N) group decouples from the other gauge\ngroups, and we know that pure U(3N) gauge theory with no flavors generically confines and\nthat the gauginos condense.\nAlthough we have carried out the analysis for large \u03ba, we can now tune \u03ba away to zero.\nSince confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are low energy phenomena controlled by\nF-terms, we expect their presence or absence to be independent of \u03ba. Therefore we expect\nconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking for our triangle quiver gauge theory.\nThis analysis applies to the general point in the mesonic branch, with or without extra\nprobe D3-branes in the bulk. If we had additional branes in the bulk, confinement of the\nfractional brane stuck at the singularity should still happen. There is a lot of evidence that\nbranes in the bulk do not modify the essential dynamics of the fractional branes [27], although\nthe fractional branes do modify the dynamics of the branes in the bulk by deforming their\nmoduli space. In essence, the analysis of the fractional branes can be done without ever\nmentioning the branes in the bulk, but the result will be correct even if branes in the bulk\nare present. If gaugino condensation happens, we should expect to see a deformed moduli\nspace for the branes in the bulk: the quantum moduli space of the gauge theory.\nAn important point is that our SU(3N) \u00d7 SU(2N) \u00d7 SU(N) theory has no flat mesonic\ndirections. The F-term equations for the classical superpotential imply that UR\u03b1 Y2 = 0.\nThus, we cannot form any nonzero gauge invariant trace operators. There are some antisymmetrized products of fields, the dibaryon operators, for example\nB = \u01eb\u03b11 ***\u03b12N \u01eb\u03b21 ***\u03b2N \u01eb\u03b31 ***\u03b3N (Y3 )\u03b1\u03b211 * * * (Y3 )\u03b1\u03b2NN (V 1 )\u03b3\u03b11N+1 * * * (V 1 )\u03b1\u03b3N2N .\n\n(27)\n\nBy turning on FI terms for the U(2N) and U(N) gauge groups, we can fix the expectation\nvalue of B.\n\n4.1\n\nSUSY Breaking for Strongly Coupled SU (3N )\n\nIgnoring the U(1) subgroups for the moment, note that the SU(3N) group is the only one\nof the three gauge groups to have Nf < Nc , so it is natural to suppose that it runs to strong\n12\n\n\fcoupling first. In this case we may construct the effective superpotential at low energies\nby standard arguments. Ignoring strong coupling effects from the other gauge groups, the\nquantum modified superpotential is [25]\n\u0012 7N \u00131/N\n\u039b3\n2 1\n1 2\nW =M V \u2212M V +N\n(28)\ndet M\nwhere we have defined the mesonic operators M \u03b1 = UR\u03b1 Y2 and a square matrix M =\n(M 1 , M 2 ). At strong coupling we treat the mesons M as if they were fundamental fields.\nThe equation of motion for the V \u03b1 sets M i = 0. However, the equation of motion for the\nM i tells us that\ni\n\u039b7 minor(Mab\n)\n0 = \u01ebij Vabj \u2212 3\n.\n(29)\n(N\n+1)/N\n(det M)\nThis equation is not consistent with setting the M i = 0 and we conclude that supersymmetry\nis broken.\nBecause the SU(3N) theory has the largest number of colors and smaller number of\nflavors, we generically expect SU(3N) to run to strong coupling first. It is possible that the\nother two groups run to strong coupling as well, which might invalidate the analysis done\nabove. In the next subsection an exact argument using the generalized Konishi anomaly\ndemonstrates that the SU(N), SU(2N), and SU(3N) groups cannot be strongly coupled at\nthe same time.\n\n4.2\n\nKonishi Anomaly Equations\n\nWe have argued that supersymmetry is broken when \u039b3 is the dominant scale in the problem.\nAs the couplings become large, anomalous dimensions can also become large and in the\nabsence of a superconformal fixed point it is very difficult to control the RG flow. At generic\npoints in the space of coupling constants, the approximations made in section 4.1 may be\ninvalid and it is not clear whether supersymmetry will be broken.\nTo make a stronger argument we need a better method to determine the possible quantum\nmodifications to W . A technique that we will find very powerful is based on the Konishi\nanomaly [18]; see also the review of Amati et al [26] and the more recent developments of\n[28]. Some of this analysis can be rephrased in terms of the language of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa\nmatrix model approach [29], which is a useful way of encoding the same set of quantum\nmodified equations of motion. These matrix models and Konishi anomaly calculations can\nencode the (quantum) deformations of complex structure of the Calabi-Yau space [27].\nThe generalized Konishi anomaly equations are derived by considering infinitesimal variations of the fields, which leave the path integral invariant, and obtaining the associated Ward\nidentities, restricted to the chiral ring. For a variation of the bifundamental X \u2192 X + \u03b4X\n13\n\n\fwhere we take \u03b4X = f (X, W\u03b1 W \u03b1 ) and W\u03b1 is the supersymmetric gauge field strength, one\nfinds\n*\n\u0015\u001b j +\n\u001a\n\u0014\n1 X\n\u2202f\n\u2212\n= htr(f (X, W\u03b1 W \u03b1 )\u2202X W )i .\n(30)\nW\u03b1 , W \u03b1 ,\n32\u03c0 2 i,j\n\u2202Xij i\n\nThe particular gauge group under which W \u03b1 transforms is fixed by gauge invariance, which\nin practice corresponds to whether W \u03b1 appears on the left or right side of f . Inside a\ntrace, we have the convenient result that tr(\u03c6[W\u03b1 W \u03b1 , X]) = 0, where \u03c6 is some arbitrary\ncombination of bifundamentals. It is also useful to recall that {W\u03b1 , W\u03b2 } = 0 in the chiral\nring.\nLet us consider the Konishi equations for \u03b4X = X. On varying the fields appearing in\nthe superpotential, we find that\ntr(UR1 Y2 V 2 ) = NS3 + 3NS1 = 3NS2 + 2NS3 ,\ntr(UR2 Y2 V 1 ) = \u2212NS3 \u2212 3NS1 = \u22123NS2 \u2212 2NS3 ,\n\n(31)\n\ntr(UR2 Y2 V 1 ) \u2212 tr(UR1 Y2 V 2 ) = \u22122NS1 \u2212 NS2 .\nwhere we have defined Sk = \u2212trk W\u03b1 W \u03b1 /32\u03c0 2 , and the trace is over the gauge group with\nrank kN. There is an additional anomaly equation from varying Y3 , which does not appear\nin the superpotential:\n2NS1 + NS2 = 0.\n(32)\nThese equations taken collectively give relations amongst the Sk , and it is easy to verify that\nthey have no solution other than the trivial one, with all the Sk = 0. The anomaly equations\nrequire that the infrared gauge theory does not undergo gaugino condensation. However,\nthis is inconsistent with the D-term arguments given earlier, which implied that some of the\nSk have to be non-zero. Our anomaly arguments assumed supersymmetry, so we conclude\nthat supersymmetry must be broken (or that the vacuum of the theory is in some other way\nill-defined.)\nThe inability to satisfy these constraints is reminiscent of the geometric obstruction to\ndeformation discovered by Altmann [7] (see Appendix A for a brief review). The cone over\ndP1 can be expressed in terms of twenty (dependent) equations in nine variables. It is possible to deform these equations by a parameter \u01eb, but one finds that mutual consistency\nof the deformed equations requires that \u01eb2 vanishes. If \u01eb were not obstructed, we would\nidentify this deformation of the geometry with the quantum deformed moduli space of the\nmesonic branch: gaugino condensation leads to a quantum modified chiral ring, and we have\nalready described in the previous section how the chiral ring and the Calabi-Yau geometry\nare related. Our analysis suggests a strong relation between the geometry of the Calabi-Yau\nspace and spontaneous SUSY breaking. We correlate the geometric deformation obstruc14\n\n\ftion to inconsistencies of the quantum modified chiral ring. Thus the name SUSY-BOG:\nsupersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometries.\nFor completeness let us consider another set of anomaly equations, which we obtain from\nthe variations \u03b4X = X W\u03b1 W \u03b1 . The anomaly equations for the UR\u03b1 and the V \u03b2 give\n1\ntr(W\u03b1 W \u03b1 UR1 Y2 V 2 ) = \u2212S1 S3 = \u2212S1 S2 ,\n32\u03c0 2\n1\ntr(W\u03b1 W \u03b1 UR2 Y2 V 1 ) = S1 S3 = S1 S2 ,\n\u2212\n32\u03c0 2\n\n\u2212\n\n(33)\n\nwhile for the Y2 , we find\n\u2212\n\n1\n32\u03c0 2\n\ntr(W\u03b1 W \u03b1 UR2 Y2 V 1 ) \u2212 tr(W\u03b1 W \u03b1 UR1 Y2 V 2 )\n\nA similar equation for Y3 yields\nS1 S2 = 0 .\n\n\u0001\n\n= S2 S3 ,\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\nbecause Y3 does not appear in the superpotential.\nTaking these quadratic relations for the Sk on their own, we would conclude that two\nof the Sk are zero. Furthermore, if only one of the gauge groups has a nonzero Sk , we can\nassume for that particular gauge group Nf < Nc . The only reasonable possibility is S3 6= 0\n\u2013 but we have already shown that if the SU(3N) group flows to strong coupling first, then\nsupersymmetry should be broken.\n\n4.3\n\nThe Baryonic Branch\n\nAll our analysis so far has concerned the pure D5-brane theory, but as argued before, this\nanalysis extends to the case where there are branes in the bulk: what happens at the\nsingularity is independent of the branes in the bulk and supersymmetry is broken on the\nmesonic branch of the general theory.\nHowever, there are other baryonic branches in moduli space which we have not analyzed\nyet. For our quiver theory, we can halt our Seiberg duality cascade one step up from the\nbottom, at the SU(4N) \u00d7 SU(3N) \u00d7 SU(2N) \u00d7 SU(N ) theory. If the group with the largest\nnumber of colors SU(4N) runs to strong coupling first, we have effectively Nf = Nc SQCD\nwith a tree level superpotential. As was noticed in [16], such a theory will have a quantum\nmodified superpotential. In addition to the mesonic branch, there is a branch of moduli\nspace where baryonic operators get expectation values.\nWe will argue that supersymmetry is broken even if we give these baryonic operators\nexpectation values. To to try to gain a deeper understanding of the various possibilities, it is\nuseful to review what happens in the case of the conifold. One step up from the bottom of the\n15\n\n\fduality cascade on the conifold, we have an SU(2N) \u00d7 SU(N) theory with bifundamentals\nAi and Bi , i = 1, 2 and a quartic superpotential\nWtree = \u01ebij \u01ebkl Ai Bk Aj Bl\n\n(36)\n\nAt strong coupling for the SU(2N) group, we form the mesonic operators Mij = Ai Bj , and\nthe superpotential is modified by quantum effects [30]\nWef f = Wtree + X(det M + BB\u0303 \u2212 \u039b2N ) .\n\n(37)\n\nOn the baryonic branch, hBB\u0303i = \u039b2N while the mesonic expectation values and the Lagrange\nmultiplier X vanish. One may obtain a low-energy effective theory on this branch by integrating out the mesons, leaving us with a pure SU(N) gauge theory supplemented by the\nbaryonic operators B, B\u0303, which lie on a flat direction.\nThe Klebanov-Strassler supergravity solution corresponds to the symmetric point B = B\u0303\non the baryonic branch [21, 31]. A one real parameter family of supersymmetric supergravity\nsolutions corresponding to changing |B| was worked out by [19]. The remarkable fact about\nthis one parameter family of solutions is that it does not involve a Calabi-Yau manifold.\nInstead, it requires only a manifold with SU(3) structure.\nThe Altmann theorem mentioned in the introduction states only that the Calabi-Yau\ncone over dP1 has no complex structure deformations. If we relax the Calabi-Yau condition\nto an SU(3) structure condition, there may still be supersymmetric supergravity solutions,\nas there are for more general points on the baryonic branch of the conifold theory.\nWe now exclude the possibility of an SU(3) structure solution. Returning to the fournode quiver theory with gauge group SU(4N) \u00d7 SU(3N) \u00d7 SU(2N) \u00d7 SU(N), with the\nSU(4N) group at strong coupling, we argue that although this theory has a baryonic branch\nthe Konishi anomaly arguments still imply that supersymmetry is broken. The first step is to\nreplace the elementary fields charged under the SU(4N) gauge group by mesons and baryons\nwhich are SU(4N) singlets. Specifically, we construct mesons MY\u03b1 = UR\u03b1 Y2 and MZ\u03b1 = UR\u03b1 Z,\nwhich have their SU(4N) indices contracted, and baryons B = [UR1 * * * UR1 UR2 * * * UR2 ] and B\u0303 =\n[Y2 * * * Y2 Z * * * Z], whose SU(4N) indices are fully antisymmetrized. This theory develops a\nquantum-modified superpotential of the form (37) and has a baryonic branch, along which\nthe baryons acquire expectation values. On this branch one also finds that the Lagrange\nmultiplier X and det M vanish.\nWhat happens to the remaining mesons? The mesons MZ appear only in a cubic term in\nthe tree-level superpotential, so they remain as light fields in the theory. On the other hand,\nthe mesons MY have a mass term from the tree-level superpotential of the form V \u03b1 MY\u03b2 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\nand we may integrate these fields out. The F-terms for the mesons MY force V \u03b1 = 0, while\nthe F-terms from varying V \u03b1 require MY\u03b1 = Y1 UL\u03b1 . By applying gauge rotations to the Y1\n16\n\n\fand UL fields one can see that the determinant of the meson matrix vanishes, and that the\nF-term equations are therefore satisfied consistently on this branch.\nAfter integrating out these massive fields, and relabeling the light fields, one finds that the\nresulting low-energy effective theory is precisely that of the three-node quiver, supplemented\nby the baryonic operators. However, the baryons do not communicate with the SU(3N) \u00d7\nSU(2N) \u00d7 SU(N) degrees of freedom. This baryonic flat direction cannot interfere with the\narguments for supersymmetry breaking given in section 4.\nProbe D3-branes\nThe preceding argument about supersymmetry breaking along the baryonic branch was not\nas strong as the Konishi anomaly arguments about the mesonic branch. For example, we\nwere not able to analyze the possibility that both the SU(3N) and SU(4N) groups ran to\nstrong coupling at once. Hedging our bets, we will assume for the moment the existence of\na supersymmetry preserving baryonic branch for the dP1 theory and a corresponding SU(3)\nstructure supergravity solution.\nWe may ask what happens to probe D3-branes in this putative supersymmetric vacuum.\nAfter all, for generic initial numbers of D3- and D5-branes in the UV, the duality cascade will\ngenerically leave some left over D3-branes in the bulk. In the Klebanov-Strassler solution,\nthese extra D3-branes were supersymmetric, but what happens at an arbitrary point on the\nbaryonic branch?\nAway from the KS point, these probe D3-branes in the conifold should break supersymmetry. The authors of [19] claim that this baryonic branch supergravity solution for\nthe conifold interpolates between the KS and the Maldacena-Nunez (MN) [32] supergravity\nsolutions. Moreover, for MN, D3-brane probes break supersymmetry.\nLet us describe more explicitly these supersymmetry conditions for D3-brane probes. Let\n\u01eb be a Killing spinor in the ten dimensional geometry. The presence of N = 1 supersymmetry\nin four dimensions guarantees the existence of at least a four dimensional representation of\nsuch spinors. For a probe D3-brane to be supersymmetric, \u01eb must be an eigenspinor of the\ncorresponding \u03ba-symmetry matrix for the probe: \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb. For a D3-brane aligned in the\ngauge theory directions, x, y, z, and t, the \u03ba-symmetry matrix is just the four dimensional\ngamma matrix\n\u0393\u03ba = i\u0393t \u0393x \u0393y \u0393z .\n(38)\nIn other words, \u01eb must have positive chirality in the four gauge theory directions.\nThe Killing spinors in the [20] SU(3) structure solutions take the general form\n\u01eb = \u03b1\u03b6+ \u2297 \u03b7+ + \u03b2\u03b6\u2212 \u2297 \u03b7\u2212 ,\n\n17\n\n(39)\n\n\fwhere \u03b6\u00b1 are the chiral and anti-chiral four dimensional spinors, and \u03b7\u00b1 are chiral and antichiral six dimensional spinors. The \u03b1 and \u03b2 are complex functions of coordinates on the\nsix-dimensional transverse geometry. In the KS solution, \u03b2 = 0, and so \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb, while\nfor the MN solution, \u03b2 = \u2212i\u03b1\u2217 , and the D3-brane breaks supersymmetry. Indeed, for any\nnonzero value of \u03b2, the D3-brane will break supersymmetry.\nUsing the table of possible SU(3) structure solutions in [20], we can make a stronger,\nmore general statement. If the D3-brane preserves supersymmetry, then \u03b2 = 0. If \u03b2 = 0, the\nsix dimensional transverse geometry must be Calabi-Yau. However, Altmann claims there is\nno Calabi-Yau deformation of the cone over dP1 . Therefore, if there is an SU(3) structure\nsolution corresponding to the baryonic branch of this dP1 field theory, probe D3-branes will\nbreak supersymmetry.\n\n5\n\nOutlook\n\nWe have shown, using a combination of traditional field theory and supergravity arguments,\nthat generically supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at low energies in the duality cascade constructed from the cone over dP1 . Traditional field theory convinced us that the\nmesonic branch must break supersymmetry. Although there is a small possibility that the\nbaryonic branch remains supersymmetric, for generic initial numbers of D3- and D5-branes,\nthere will be extra D3-branes at the bottom of the cascade which we argued should also lead\nto supersymmetry breaking.\nThis mechanism for supersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometries, or SUSY-BOG,\nshould work more generally. We start with some Calabi-Yau cone to which we add D3and D5-branes. Generically, a duality cascade will result, where the number of D3-branes\nis gradually reduced as we move toward the tip of the cone. When we reach the bottom of\nthe cascade, we expect to find a confining theory and presumably confinement will happen\nvia gaugino condensation. In such a situation, we expect a deformed chiral ring and hence\na deformed complex structure of the geometry.3 The unifying feature of the SUSY-BOG\nmechanism is an obstruction in the complex deformation space of the Calabi-Yau cone. Our\nconjecture is that in all of these situations supersymmetry will be spontaneously broken.\nThe cone over dP1 is not alone in having such an obstruction. For example, we expect to be\nable to set up a duality cascade using the Y p,q space [16], but there is such an obstruction\nfor all the Y p,q , p > q > 0.\nFor the higher del Pezzos dPn , 1 < n < 9, there will also generically be a problem. We\nexpect to be able to set up a duality cascade. For the general dPn there are n vanishing two3\n\nSee [33] for more examples of unobstructed deformations where the endpoint of the cascade is either a\nconfining theory or a superconformal fixed point.\n\n18\n\n\fcycles and thus n types of D5-branes. However, in general there are fewer than n complex\nstructure deformations [34]. For example, for dP2 , there is only one such deformation. Thus,\nunless the initial numbers of D5-branes are chosen carefully, we expect SUSY-BOG to occur\nat low energies, at the end of the duality cascade.\nWhile we were finishing this paper, [35] appeared. The authors claim to find a first\norder complex structure deformation of the cone over dP1 and construct from this first order\ndeformation the analog of the KS solution [1] for dP1 . This construction is completely\ncompatible with our story. We anticipate, from [7], that they will not be able to continue\ntheir deformation to higher order in \u01eb. It would be very interesting, but presumably quite\ndifficult, to construct a non-supersymmetric gravity solution for the deformed cone.\nNote Added After this work was completed, we became aware of the closely related\npapers [36, 37] which reach similar conclusions.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Marcus Berg, Aaron Bergman, Henriette Elvang, Michael Haack,\nIgor Klebanov, Matt Strassler, and Brian Wecht for useful discussions and comments.

We include these results in this appendix.\nIn this section, we review the construction of the Y p,q gauge theories. As derived in [13],\nthe quivers for these Y p,q gauge theories can be constructed from two basic units, \u03c3 and \u03c4 .\nThese units are shown in Figure 3. To construct a general quiver for Y p,q , we define some\nbasic operations with \u03c3 and \u03c4 . First, there are the inverted unit cells, \u03c3\u0303 and \u03c4\u0303 , which are\nmirror images of \u03c3 and \u03c4 through a horizontal plane. To glue the cells together, we identify\nthe double arrows corresponding to the U \u03b1 fields on two unit cells. The arrows have to be\n20\n\n\fb)\n\na)\n\nY\n\nY\n\nU\n\nY\n\nU\n\nU\n\nU\n\nV\n\nc)\n\nZ\nZ\n\nY\n\nY\nU\n\nU\n\nU\n\nV\n\nY\n\nY\n\nU\n\nU\n\nY\nY\n\nV\n\nY\n\nV\n\nFigure 3: Shown are a) the unit cell \u03c3; b) the unit cell \u03c4 ; and c) the quiver for Y 4,3 , \u03c3\u03c4\u0303 \u03c3\u03c3\u0303.\npointing in the same direction for the identification to work. So for instance we may form\nthe quiver \u03c3\u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4\u0303 \u03c3, but \u03c3\u03c4 is not allowed. In this notation, the first unit cell is to be glued\nnot only to the cell on the right but also to the last cell in the chain. A general quiver might\nlook like\n\u03c3\u03c3\u0303\u03c3\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4 \u03c3\u0303 .\n(43)\nIn general, a Y p,q quiver consists of p unit cells of which q are of type \u03c3. The Y p,p\u22121 gauge\ntheories will have only one \u03c4 type unit cell, while the Y p,1 theories will have only one \u03c3 type\nunit cell.\nEach node of the quiver corresponds to a gauge group while each arrow is a chiral field\ntransforming in a bifundamental representation. For the Y p,q spaces, there are four types of\nbifundamentals labeled U \u03b1 , V \u03b1 , Y , and Z where \u03b1 = 1 or 2. To get a conformal theory, we\ntake all the gauge groups to be SU(N).\nThe superpotential for this quiver theory is constructed by summing over gauge invariant\noperators cubic and quartic in the fields U \u03b1 , V \u03b1 , Y , and Z. For each \u03c3 unit cell in the gauge\ntheory, we add two cubic terms to the superpotential of the form\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 UL\u03b1 V \u03b2 Y and \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 UR\u03b1 Y V \u03b2 .\n\n(44)\n\nHere, the indices R and L specify which group of U \u03b1 enter in the superpotential, the U \u03b1 on\n21\n\n\fthe right side or the left side of \u03c3. The trace over the color indices has been suppressed. For\neach \u03c4 unit cell, we add the quartic term\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 UL\u03b1 Y UR\u03b2 Z .\n\n(45)\n\nThe signs should be chosen so that no phases appear in the relations.\n\nB.1\n\nChiral Primaries for General Y p,q\n\nThe quivers for general Y p,q are quite complicated, but some easy patterns emerge. We\nalways expect to find the b1 , b2 , and b3 type building blocks, for these operators are just the\nindependent superpotential type loops transforming in a three dimensional representation\nof SU(2). At the superconformal point, the R-charges of the bi are clearly all equal to two.\nThe ai and ci type operators also have analogs for general p and q.\nFor the ai , it turns out there exists a loop in the quiver with p Y type fields and p \u2212 q\ntype U fields. Such a loop naturally transforms in a p \u2212 q + 1 dimensional representation of\nSU(2) and has an R-charge\nRa = pRY + (p \u2212 q)RU .\n(46)\nFor the ci , there is a loop with p type U operators, q type V operators and p \u2212 q type Z\noperators. Such a loop transforms in a p + q + 1 dimensional representation of SU(2) and\nhas R-charge\nRc = pRU + qRV + (p \u2212 q)RZ .\n(47)\nNote that (46) and (47) are consistent with the R-charges given for Ra and Rc in footnote 1.\nOne can also see the a, b, and c type operators emerge from the toric diagram for the\ncones over the Y p,q . Recall [9] that the toric cone is given by the four vectors:\ne1 = (1, 0, 0) ;\n\ne2 = (1, 1, 0) ;\n\ne3 = (1, p, p) ;\n\ne4 = (1, p \u2212 q \u2212 1, p \u2212 q) .\n\n(48)\n\nThe dual cone \u03c3 \u2228 must then be bounded by the vectors orthogonal to the faces of \u03c3:\ne\u22281 = (0, 0, \u22121) ;\n\ne\u22282 = (\u2212p, p, \u2212p + 1) ;\n\ne\u22283 = (\u2212p, \u2212q, q + 1) ;\n\ne\u22284 = (0, \u2212p + q, p \u2212 q \u2212 1) .\n(49)\n\nWe now study \u03c3 \u2228 . Notice that e\u22281 and e\u22284 lie along the line x = 0 and z = \u2212y \u2212 1. This\nline will thus include p \u2212 q + 1 lattice points, and we tentatively identify these points with\nthe ai . Similarly, e\u22282 and e\u22283 lie along the line x = \u2212p and z = \u2212y + 1. This line includes\np + q + 1 lattice points, and we identify these points with the ci .\nFinally, consider the three lattice points (\u22121, 0, 0), (\u22121, 1, \u22121) and (\u22121, \u22121, 1). These\nthree points would be good candidates for the bi \u2013 the points would lead to expected relations\n22\n\n\fz\n\ny\n\nFigure 4: The dual cone \u03c3 \u2228 for Y 5,1 . The a type operators correspond to lattice points\nalong the red line, the b type operators to lattice points along the green line, and the c type\noperators to lattice points along the blue line.\n\n23\n\n\fof the form ac \u223c bp .

Thus any holomorphic function\nshould satisfy the Laplace equation, \u0003\u03c9 = 0. These holomorphic functions are our chiral\nprimary operators.\nMartelli and Sparks [9] provide three meromorphic functions on the cone over Y p,q :\nz1 = ei\u03c6 tan\n\n\u03b8\n2\n\n(63)\n3\n\n\u22126i\u03b1\u2212i\u03c8\n\nz2 = e\nz3\n\n2 Y\n\u2212 1\n(y \u2212 yi ) 2yi\nsin \u03b8 i=1\n\n3\nY\n1 3 i\u03c8\n=\nr e sin \u03b8 (y \u2212 yi )1/2 .\n2\ni=1\n\n(64)\n(65)\n\nOne can check that away from their singularities, these zi satisfy \u0003zi = 0. Of these three\nfunctions, z3 is also holomorphic. The function z1 has a singularity at \u03b8 = \u03c0, while z2 has\n25\n\n\fsingularities at \u03b8 = 0, \u03b8 = \u03c0, and y = y2 . (Recall that y1 < 0.) The function z2 has the\nadditional pathology of not being periodic under shifts \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 + 2\u03c0l.\nUsing these three zi , we would like to assemble a family of better behaved holomorphic\nfunctions on the cone. For this family, we assume the ansatz\n\u2212a/6 n\u2212a/6\nz3\n\nFmna (zi ) = z1m z2\n\n(66)\n\n= r 3n\u2212a/2 eim\u03c6 ein\u03c8 eia\u03b1 sinn+m\nwhere\nei =\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\ncosn\u2212m\n2\n2\n\n3\nY\n\n(y \u2212 yi )ei\n\ni=1\n\n1\n(a(1 \u2212 yi ) + 6nyi ) .\n12yi\n\n(67)\n\nTo be free of singularities in \u03b8, we must take \u2212n \u2264 m \u2264 n. To be free of singularities in\ny, we have the two conditions ei \u2265 0 for i = 1, 2. We also have a number of periodicity\nconstraints. For periodicity in \u03b1, we need a = P/l where P is an integer. We will assume\nthat \u03c6 is periodic under shifts by 2\u03c0 and that \u03c6 + \u03c8 is periodic under shifts by 4\u03c0. These\nconstraints then imply that m and n are either both integer or both half-integer.\nOne easy set of holomorphic functions can be found by setting a = 0. We find\n3\n\nb1 = z3 z1\u22121 = r 3 ei(\u03c8\u2212\u03c6) cos2\n\n\u03b8Y\n(y \u2212 yi )1/2\n2 i=1\n\n(68)\n\n3\n\nb2 = z3 = r 3 ei\u03c8 sin\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8Y\n(y \u2212 yi )1/2\ncos\n2\n2 i=1\n\n(69)\n\n3\n\n3 i(\u03c8+\u03c6)\n\nb3 = z3 z1 = r e\n\n\u03b8Y\nsin\n(y \u2212 yi )1/2\n2 i=1\n2\n\n(70)\n\nwhere we have identified these objects with the holomorphic monomials of the previous\nsection. Superficially, b1 seems not to be single valued at \u03b8 = 0 while b3 would not be single\nvalued at \u03b8 = \u03c0. In fact, at these poles, the metric on Y p,q degenerates such that the good\nangular coordinate at \u03b8 = 0 is no longer \u03c8 but \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6 and at \u03b8 = \u03c0, \u03c8 + \u03c6.\nTo find the other holomorphic functions, we explore the boundaries of the singularity\nconditions on y. In particular, consider the limit ei = 0.

In\nother words, (79) agrees with (46) and (74) is eqal to (47).\n\n27\n\n\fWe now check that these aj and cj are indeed single valued at y = y2 and y\nrespectively.
