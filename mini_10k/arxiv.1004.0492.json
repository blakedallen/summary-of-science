Among the conundrums in the dark energy\ncosmology, the so-called cosmological coincidence problem is the most familiar one. This problem is asking\nwhy are we living in an epoch in which the densities of dark energy and matter are comparable? Since\ntheir densities scale differently with the expansion of our universe, there should be some fine-tunings. To\nalleviate the cosmological coincidence problem, it is natural to consider the possible interaction between\ndark energy and dark matter in the literature (see e.g. [2\u20139, 31, 32]). In fact, since the nature of both\ndark energy and dark matter are still unknown, there is no physical argument to exclude the possible\ninteraction between them. On the contrary, some observational evidences of this interaction have been\nfound recently. For example, in a series of papers by Bertolami et al. [10], they shown that the Abell\nCluster A586 exhibits evidence of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and they argued\nthat this interaction might imply a violation of the equivalence principle. On the other hand, in [11],\nAbdalla et al. found the signature of interaction between dark energy and dark matter by using optical,\nX-ray and weak lensing data from 33 relaxed galaxy clusters. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the\ninteraction between dark energy and dark matter in cosmology.\nWe consider a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. In the literature, it is usual to assume\nthat dark energy and dark matter interact through a coupling term Q, according to\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H\u03c1m = Q,\n\u03c1\u0307X + 3H\u03c1X (1 + wX ) = \u2212Q,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1m and \u03c1X are densities of dark matter and dark energy (we assume that the baryon component\ncan be ignored); wX is the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of dark energy and it is assumed to be a\nconstant; a dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time t; H \u2261 \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter;\na = (1 + z)\u22121 is the scale factor (we have set a0 = 1; the subscript \"0\" indicates the present value\nof corresponding quantity; z is the redshift). Notice that Eqs. (1) and (2) preserve the total energy\nconservation equation\n\u03c1\u0307tot + 3H\u03c1tot (1 + weff ) = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1tot = \u03c1X +\u03c1m is the total energy; weff is the total (effective) EoS. Since there is no natural guidance\nfrom fundamental physics on the coupling term Q, one can only discuss it to a phenomenal level. The\nmost familiar coupling terms extensively considered in the literature are Q = \u03b1\u03ba\u03c1m \u03c6\u0307, Q = 3\u03b2H\u03c1tot ,\nand Q = 3\u03b7H\u03c1m . The first one arises from, for instance, string theory or scalar-tensor theory (including\nBrans-Dicke theory) [4\u20136]. The other two are phenomenally proposed to alleviate the coincidence problem\nin the other dark energy models [7\u20139]. In the usual approach, one should priorly write down the coupling\nterm Q, and then obtain the evolutions of \u03c1m and \u03c1X from Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. In fact, this is\nthe common way to study the interacting dark energy models in the literature.\nHowever, there is also an alternative way in the literature [12\u201316]. One can reverse the logic mentioned\nabove. Due to the interaction Q, the evolutions of \u03c1m and \u03c1X should deviate from the ones without\ninteraction, i.e., \u03c1m \u221d a\u22123 and \u03c1X \u221d a\u22123(1+wX ) , respectively. If the deviated evolutions of \u03c1m and/or\n\u03c1X are given, one can find the corresponding interaction Q from Eqs. (1) and (2). Naively, the simplest\nexample has been considered by Wang and Meng [12], namely\n\u03c1m = \u03c1m0 a\u22123+\u01eb ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a constant which measures the deviation from the normal \u03c1m \u221d a\u22123 . Substituting into Eq. (1),\nit is easy to find the corresponding interaction Q = \u01ebH\u03c1m [9, 12, 13, 17]. Alternatively, one can consider\nanother type of interacting dark energy model which is characterized by [14, 15]\n\u03c1X\n\u03c1 0\n= X a\u03be ,\n(5)\n\u03c1m\n\u03c1m0\nwhere \u03be is a constant which measures the severity of the coincidence problem. From Eqs. (1), (2) and (5),\none can find that the corresponding interaction is given by [15]\nQ = \u2212H\u03c1m \u03a9X (\u03be + 3wX ) = \u2212H\u03c1X \u03a9m (\u03be + 3wX ) ,\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nwhere \u03a9i \u2261 8\u03c0G\u03c1i /(3H 2 ) for i = m and X, which are the fractional energy densities of dark matter\nand dark energy, respectively. In fact, Guo et al. [15] considered the cosmological constraints on the\ninteracting dark energy model characterized by Eq. (5) with the 71 SNLS Type Ia supernovae (SNIa)\ndataset, the shift parameter R from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 3-year (WMAP3) data,\nand the distance parameter A of the measurement of the BAO peak in the distribution of SDSS luminous\nred galaxies. On the other hand, the interacting dark energy model characterized by Eq. (4) has been\nextended in [16]. It is more realistic that \u01eb is a function of time. Costa and Alcaniz [16] considered the\ninteracting dark energy model characterized by\n\u03c1m = \u03c1m0 a\u22123+\u01eb(a) ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 a\u01eb1 ,\n\n(8)\n\nin which \u01eb(a) was chosen to be\n\nwhere \u01eb0 and \u01eb1 are constants. They obtained the constraints on this model by using the 307 Union SNIa\ndataset, the CMB constraint \u03a9m0 h2 = 0.109 \u00b1 0.006 from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n5-year (WMAP5) data, and the distance ratio from zBAO = 0.35 to zLS = 1089 measured by SDSS,\nnamely RBAO/LS = 0.0979 \u00b1 0.0036.\nIn the present work, we generalize the interacting dark energy models considered in [15, 16], and we\ncall them type I and II models, respectively. The type I models are characterized by\n\u03c1X\n= f (a),\n\u03c1m\n\n(9)\n\nwhere f (a) can be any function of a, beyond the special case in Eq. (5). The type II models are characterized by Eq. (7) but \u01eb(a) can be any function of a, beyond the special case in Eq. (8). In the present work,\nwe consider the constraints on these models by using the latest cosmological observations, namely, the\n397 Constitution SNIa dataset [18], the shift parameter R from the newly released Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) data [19], and the distance parameter A of the measurement of the\nBAO peak in the distribution of SDSS luminous red galaxies [20, 21]. In the next section, we briefly\nintroduce these observational data. In Sec. III and Sec. IV, we discuss the type I and II models, and\nconsider their cosmological constraints, respectively. A brief summary is given in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL DATA\n\nIn the present work, we will consider the latest cosmological observations, namely, the 397 Constitution\nSNIa dataset [18], the shift parameter R from the newly released Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n7-year (WMAP7) data [19], and the distance parameter A of the measurement of the BAO peak in the\ndistribution of SDSS luminous red galaxies [20, 21].\nThe data points of the 397 Constitution SNIa compiled in [18] are given in terms of the distance\nmodulus \u03bcobs (zi ). On the other hand, the theoretical distance modulus is defined as\n\u03bcth (zi ) \u2261 5 log10 DL (zi ) + \u03bc0 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 \u2261 42.38 \u2212 5 log10 h and h is the Hubble constant H0 in units of 100 km/s/Mpc, whereas\nZ z\ndz\u0303\n,\n(11)\nDL (z) = (1 + z)\nE(z\u0303;\np)\n0\nin which E \u2261 H/H0 , and p denotes the model parameters. Correspondingly, the \u03c72 from the 397\nConstitution SNIa is given by\n\u03c72\u03bc (p) =\n\nX [\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi )]2\ni\n\n\u03c3 2 (zi )\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\n\f4\nwhere \u03c3 is the corresponding 1\u03c3 error. The parameter \u03bc0 is a nuisance parameter but it is independent of\nthe data points. One can perform an uniform marginalization over \u03bc0 . However, there is an alternative\nway. Following [22, 23], the minimization with respect to \u03bc0 can be made by expanding the \u03c72\u03bc of Eq. (12)\nwith respect to \u03bc0 as\n\u03c72\u03bc (p) = \u00c3 \u2212 2\u03bc0 B\u0303 + \u03bc20 C\u0303 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\n\u00c3(p) =\n\nB\u0303(p) =\n\nX [\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03bc0 = 0, p)]2\n,\n\u03c3\u03bc2 obs (zi )\ni\n\nX \u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03bc0 = 0, p)\n,\n\u03c3\u03bc2 obs (zi )\ni\n\nC\u0303 =\n\nX\ni\n\n1\n\u03c3\u03bc2 obs (zi )\n\n.\n\nEq. (13) has a minimum for \u03bc0 = B\u0303/C\u0303 at\n\u03c7\u03032\u03bc (p) = \u00c3(p) \u2212\n\nB\u0303(p)2\n.\nC\u0303\n\n(14)\n\nSince \u03c72\u03bc, min = \u03c7\u03032\u03bc, min obviously, we can instead minimize \u03c7\u03032\u03bc which is independent of \u03bc0 .\nThere are some other observational data, such as the observations of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropy [19] and large-scale structure (LSS) [20]. However, using the full data of CMB and LSS\nto perform a global fitting consumes a large amount of computation time and power. As an alternative, one\ncan instead use the shift parameter R from the CMB, and the distance parameter A of the measurement\nof the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak in the distribution of SDSS luminous red galaxies. In the\nliterature, the shift parameter R and the distance parameter A have been used extensively. It is argued\nthat they are model-independent [24], while R and A contain the main information of the observations\nof CMB and BAO, respectively.\nAs is well known, the shift parameter R of the CMB is defined by [24, 25]\nZ z\u2217\ndz\u0303\n1/2\nR \u2261 \u03a9m0\n,\n(15)\nE(z\u0303)\n0\nwhere the redshift of recombination z\u2217 = 1091.3 which has been updated in the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) data [19]. The shift parameter R relates the angular diameter\ndistance to the last scattering surface, the comoving size of the sound horizon at z\u2217 and the angular\nscale of the first acoustic peak in CMB power spectrum of temperature fluctuations [24, 25]. The value\nof R has been updated to 1.725 \u00b1 0.018 from the WMAP7 data [19]. On the other hand, the distance\nparameter A of the measurement of the BAO peak in the distribution of SDSS luminous red galaxies [20]\nis given by\n\u0014 Z zb\n\u00152/3\n1\ndz\u0303\n1/2\n\u22121/3\nA \u2261 \u03a9m0 E(zb )\n,\n(16)\nzb 0 E(z\u0303)\nwhere zb = 0.35. In [21], the value of A has been determined to be 0.469 (ns /0.98)\u22120.35 \u00b1 0.017. Here the\nscalar spectral index ns is taken to be 0.963, which has been updated from the WMAP7 data [19]. So,\nthe total \u03c72 is given by\n\u03c72 = \u03c7\u03032\u03bc + \u03c72CMB + \u03c72BAO ,\n\n(17)\n\n2\n2\nwhere \u03c7\u03032\u03bc is given in Eq. (14), \u03c72CMB = (R \u2212 Robs )2 /\u03c3R\nand \u03c72BAO = (A \u2212 Aobs )2 /\u03c3A\n. The best-fit\n2\nmodel parameters are determined by minimizing the total \u03c7 . As in [26, 27], the 68% confidence level\nis determined by \u2206\u03c72 \u2261 \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min \u2264 1.0, 2.3 and 3.53 for np = 1, 2 and 3, respectively, where np\nis the number of free model parameters. Similarly, the 95% confidence level is determined by \u2206\u03c72 \u2261\n\u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min \u2264 4.0, 6.17 and 8.02 for np = 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nTYPE I MODELS\nA.\n\nEquations\n\nAs mentioned in Sec. I, the type I models are characterized by Eq. (9), whereas f (a) can be any\nfunction of a. From Eq. (9), it is easy to obtain\n\u03a9X =\n\nf\n,\n1+f\n\n\u03a9m =\n\n1\n.\n1+f\n\n(18)\n\nSubstituting \u03c1X = \u03c1m f (a) into Eq. (2) and using \u03c1\u0307m from Eq. (1), we can find that the corresponding\ninteraction term is given by\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\n\u0013\nf\nf\n(19)\nQ = \u2212H\u03c1m \u03a9X a + 3wX = \u2212H\u03c1X \u03a9m a + 3wX ,\nf\nf\nwhere a prime denotes the derivative with respect to a. Obviously, if f (a) \u221d a\u03be , Eq. (19) reduces to\nEq. (6) which has been obtained in [15]. On the other hand, one can recast Eq. (3) as\nd ln \u03c1tot\n= \u22123 (1 + weff ) = \u22123 (1 + \u03a9X wX ) .\nd ln a\nUsing Eq. (18), we can integrate Eq. (20) to obtain\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\n3wX f\n\u03c1tot = a\u22123 exp \u2212\nd ln a * const. ,\n1+f\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nwhere const. is an integral constant, which can be determined by requiring the condition \u03c1tot (a = 1) =\n\u03c1tot,0 = 3H02 /(8\u03c0G). Once \u03c1tot is on hand, we can readily find the corresponding E \u2261 H/H0 from\nFriedmann equation, and then fit it to the observational data. Correspondingly, \u03c1X = \u03a9X \u03c1tot and\n\u03c1m = \u03a9m \u03c1tot are also available from Eqs. (18) and (21). Finally, it is worth noting that by definition (9),\nwe have\nf0 = f (a = 1) =\n\n\u03c1X 0\n1\n=\n\u22121,\n\u03c1m0\n\u03a9m0\n\n(22)\n\nwhich is useful to fix one of parameters in f (a).\n\nB.\n\nCosmological constraints on type I models\n\nIn this subsection, we consider the cosmological constraints on type I models by using the observational\ndata given in Sec. II. At first, we consider the power-law case with\nf (a) = f0 a\u03be ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03be is a constant; f0 can be determined by definition (9) to be the one given in Eq. (22), and\nhence it is not an independent parameter. In this case, there are three free model parameters, namely,\n\u03a9m0 , wX and \u03be. Although the cosmological constraints on the model characterized by Eq. (23) has been\nconsidered by Guo et al. [15], as mentioned in Sec. I, they have used the earlier observational data.\nTherefore, it is still worthwhile to consider the cosmological constraints once more in the present work by\nusing the latest observational data mentioned in Sec. II. Substituting Eq. (23) into Eq. (21) and requiring\n\u03c1tot (a = 1) = \u03c1tot,0 , we can determine the integral constant, and finally obtain\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22123wX / \u03be\n\u03c1tot = \u03c1tot,0 a\u22123 \u03a9m0 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m0 ) a\u03be\n.\n\n(24)\n\n\f6\nSubstituting into Friedmann equation, we find that\nE2 =\n\n\u0003\u22123wX / \u03be\n\u0002\nH2\n= a\u22123 \u03a9m0 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m0 ) a\u03be\n2\nH0\n\u0003\u22123wX / \u03be\n\u0002\n.\n= (1 + z)3 \u03a9m0 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m0 ) (1 + z)\u2212\u03be\n\n(25)\n\nBy minimizing the corresponding total \u03c72 in Eq. (17), we find the best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.281,\nwX = \u22120.982 and \u03be = 2.988, whereas \u03c72min = 465.604. In Fig. 1, we also present the corresponding 68%\nand 95% confidence level contours in wX \u2212 \u03be plane, \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03be plane and \u03a9m0 \u2212 wX plane. It is easy to\nsee that these constraints on the model characterized by f (a) = f0 a\u03be are much tighter than the ones\nobtained by Guo et al.

See the text for details.\n\nNext, we consider a new case with\nf (a) = f0 + \u03be(1 \u2212 a),\n\n(26)\n\nwhich can be regarded as a linear expansion of f (a) with respect to a, similar to the familiar ChevallierPolarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization for EoS w(a) = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a) [28]. Again, f0 can be determined\nby definition (9) to be the one given in Eq. (22), and hence it is not an independent parameter. Thus,\nthere are three free model parameters, namely, \u03a9m0 , wX and \u03be. Substituting Eq. (26) into Eq. (21) and\nrequiring \u03c1tot (a = 1) = \u03c1tot,0 , we can determine the integral constant, and finally obtain\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22123wX \u03a9m0 /(1+\u03be\u03a9m0 )\n.\n\u03c1tot = \u03c1tot,0 a\u22123(1+wX ) (1 + \u03be\u03a9m0 ) a\u22121 \u2212 \u03be\u03a9m0\n\n(27)\n\n\f8\nSubstituting into Friedmann equation, we find that\nE2 =\n\n\u0003\u22123wX \u03a9m0 /(1+\u03be\u03a9m0 )\n\u0002\nH2\n= a\u22123(1+wX ) (1 + \u03be\u03a9m0 ) a\u22121 \u2212 \u03be\u03a9m0\n2\nH0\n= (1 + z)3(1+wX ) [ (1 + \u03be\u03a9m0 ) (1 + z) \u2212 \u03be\u03a9m0 ]\n\n\u22123wX \u03a9m0 /(1+\u03be\u03a9m0 )\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\n-2.85\n\n-2.85\n\n-2.9\n\n-2.9\n\n-2.95\n\n-2.95\n\n\u039e\n\n\u039e\n\n\u22121\nNoting Eq. (9) and imposing the condition \u03c1X \u2265 0, we have \u03be \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03a9m0\nfrom Eqs. (26) and (22). Under\n2\nthis condition, by minimizing the corresponding total \u03c7 in Eq. (17), we find the best-fit parameters\n\u03a9m0 = 0.218, wX = \u22120.483 and \u03be = \u22123.584, whereas \u03c72min = 563.77. In Fig. 2, we also present the\ncorresponding 68% and 95% confidence level contours in wX \u2212 \u03be plane, \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03be plane and \u03a9m0 \u2212 wX\nplane. It is easy to see that the 68% and 95% confidence level contours are very close. On the other\nhand, \u03c72min = 563.77 is fairly larger than the degree of freedom dof \u223c 400.\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-3.05\n\n-3.05\n-1\n\n-0.95\n\n-0.9\n\n-0.85\nwx\n\n-0.8\n\n0.28\n\n-0.75\n\n0.285\n\n0.29\n\n0.295\n\nWm0\n\n-0.75\n\n-0.8\n\nwx\n\n-0.85\n\n-0.9\n\n-0.95\n\n-1\n0.28\n\n0.285\n\n0.29\n\n0.295\n\nWm0\n\nFIG. 3: The same as in Fig. 1, except for the type I model characterized by f (a) = f0 + \u03be(1 \u2212 a) without the\ncondition \u03be \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\nm0 . See the text for details.\n\n\f9\nSo, we give up the condition \u03be \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\nm0 in the case of f (a) = f0 + \u03be(1 \u2212 a). This means that \u03c1X might\nbe negative in the early universe. In fact, Guo et al. [15] also explicitly include this possibility. Since\nsuch a negative energy appears in phantom models [29] and modified gravity models [30], it is reasonable\nto consider this possibility. Without the condition \u03be \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\nm0 , by minimizing the corresponding total\n\u03c72 in Eq. (17), we find the best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.288, wX = \u22120.868 and \u03be = \u22122.957, whereas\n\u03c72min = 467.718. In Fig. 3, we also present the corresponding 68% and 95% confidence level contours in\nwX \u2212 \u03be plane, \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03be plane and \u03a9m0 \u2212 wX plane. Obviously, these results are significantly better than\n2\nthe ones with the condition \u03be \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\nm0 , whereas the corresponding \u03c7min = 467.718 is also better.\nFinally, one might consider the logarithmic case with\nf (a) = f0 + \u03be ln a,\n\n(29)\n\nwhich can be regarded as a linear expansion of f (a) with respect to the so-called e-folding time N = ln a\nin the literature. This case seems attractive since in Eq. (21) the integration is with respect to ln a.\nHowever, in this case, f (a) (and hence \u03c1X ) diverges when a \u2192 0 in the early universe. So, we do not\nconsider the logarithmic case in type I model.\n\nIV.\n\nTYPE II MODELS\nA.\n\nEquations\n\nIn this section, we turn to type II models, which are characterized by Eq. (7) whereas \u01eb(a) can be any\nfunction of a. Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (1), we can easily find that the corresponding interaction\nterm is given by\nQ = H\u03c1m [ \u01eb(a) + a\u01eb\u2032 (a) ln a ] .\n\n(30)\n\nIt is worth noting that in type II models, there is no condition like Eq. (22) in type I models to reduce\nthe number of free model parameters. If there are at least two parameters in \u01eb(a), adding \u03a9m0 and wX ,\nwe should have four free model parameters or even more. In this case, the constraints will be very loose,\nand the calculations will be very involved. Instead, we follow Costa and Alcaniz [16] to consider the case\nwith a fixed wX = \u22121, namely, the role of dark energy is played by a decaying \u039b [12, 16]. Therefore,\nEq. (2) becomes\n\u03c1\u0307\u039b = \u2212Q = \u2212H\u03c1m [ \u01eb(a) + a\u01eb\u2032 (a) ln a ] .\n\n(31)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (31), we have\nd\u03c1\u039b\n= \u2212\u03c1m0 a\u22124+\u01eb(a) [ \u01eb(a) + a\u01eb\u2032 (a) ln a ] .\nda\n\n(32)\n\nWe can integrate Eq. (32) to obtain\n\u03c1\u039b = \u03c1m0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u00e3\u22124+\u01eb(\u00e3) [ \u01eb(\u00e3) + \u00e3\u01eb\u2032 (\u00e3) ln \u00e3 ] d\u00e3 + \u03c1\u039b0 .\n\n(33)\n\na\n\nSubstituting Eqs. (33) and (7) into Friedmann equation, we find that\nE2 =\n\nH2\n= \u03a9m0 \u03b8(a) + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m0 ) ,\nH02\n\n(34)\n\nwhere\n\u03b8(a) \u2261 a\n\n\u22123+\u01eb(a)\n\n+\n\nZ\n\na\n\n1\n\n\u00e3\u22124+\u01eb(\u00e3) [ \u01eb(\u00e3) + \u00e3\u01eb\u2032 (\u00e3) ln \u00e3 ] d\u00e3 .\n\n(35)\n\n\f10\n3\n2.5\n\n\u03951\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n-0.4 -0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03950\n3\n\n0.4\n\n2.5\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n\u03950\n\n\u03951\n\n0\n1.5\n\n-0.2\n1\n-0.4\n0.5\n-0.6\n0.24\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\n0.34\n\n0.24\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\n0.34\n\nFIG. 4: The 68% and 95% confidence level contours in \u01eb0 \u2212 \u01eb1 plane, \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u01eb0 plane and \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u01eb1 plane for the\ntype II model characterized by \u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 a\u01eb1 . The best-fit parameters are also indicated by the black solid points.\n\nB.\n\nCosmological constraints on type II models\n\nIn this subsection, we consider the cosmological constraints on type II models by using the observational\ndata given in Sec. II. At first, we consider the power-law case with\n\u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 a\u01eb1 ,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere \u01eb0 and \u01eb1 are constants. In this case, there are three free model parameters, namely, \u03a9m0 , \u01eb0 and \u01eb1 .\nAlthough the cosmological constraints on the model characterized by Eq. (36) has been considered by\nCosta and Alcaniz [16], as mentioned in Sec. I, they have used the earlier observational data. Therefore,\nit is still worthwhile to consider the cosmological constraints once more in the present work by using the\nlatest observational data mentioned in Sec. II. Substituting Eq. (36) into Eqs. (34) and (35), we can then\nfit this model to the observational data. By minimizing the corresponding total \u03c72 in Eq. (17), we find\n\n\f11\nthe best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.282, \u01eb0 = \u22120.129 and \u01eb1 = 1.263, whereas \u03c72min = 465.635. In Fig. 4, we\nalso present the corresponding 68% and 95% confidence level contours in \u01eb0 \u2212 \u01eb1 plane, \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u01eb0 plane\nand \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u01eb1 plane. It is easy to see from the \u01eb0 \u2212 \u01eb1 plane that if \u01eb0 is close to zero, \u01eb1 cannot be too\nnegative. On the other hand, the constraint on the parameter \u01eb1 is still very loose.\nNext, we turn to the CPL-like case with\n\u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 + \u01eb1 (1 \u2212 a),\n\n(37)\n\nwhich can be regarded as a linear expansion of \u01eb(a) with respect to a, similar to the well-known CPL\nparameterization for EoS w(a) = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a) [28]. Substituting Eq. (37) into Eqs. (34) and (35), we\ncan then fit this model to the observational data. By minimizing the corresponding total \u03c72 in Eq. (17),\nwe find the best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.280, \u01eb0 = \u22120.199 and \u01eb1 = 0.214, whereas \u03c72min = 465.604.

Substituting Eq. (38) into Eqs. (34) and (35), we can then fit this model to the observational\ndata. By minimizing the corresponding total \u03c72 in Eq. (17), we find the best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.278,\n\u01eb0 = \u22120.202 and \u01eb1 = \u22120.059, whereas \u03c72min = 465.516. In Fig. 6, we also present the corresponding 68%\nand 95% confidence level contours in \u01eb0 \u2212 \u01eb1 plane, \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u01eb0 plane and \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u01eb1 plane.\n\n0\n-0.02\n\n\u03951\n\n-0.04\n-0.06\n-0.08\n-0.1\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n\u03950\n\n-0.045\n\n-0.16\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.18\n\n\u03951\n\n\u03950\n\n-0.055\n-0.2\n\n-0.06\n-0.22\n\n-0.065\n-0.07\n\n-0.24\n0.24\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\n0.34\n\n0.24\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\nFIG. 6: The same as in Fig. 4, except for the type II model characterized by \u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 + \u01eb1 ln a.\n\n0.34\n\n\f13\nModel\n\n\u039bCDM\n\nIPL\n\nBest fits\n\n\u03a9m0 = 0.278 \u03a9m0 = 0.281\n\nICPLw\n\nICPLwo\n\nIIPL\n\n\u03a9m0 = 0.218\n\n\u03a9m0 = 0.288\n\n\u03a9m0 = 0.282 \u03a9m0 = 0.280 \u03a9m0 = 0.278\n\nwX = \u22120.982 wX = \u22120.483 wX = \u22120.868 \u01eb0 = \u22120.129\n\nIICPL\n\u01eb0 = \u22120.199\n\nIILog\n\u01eb0 = \u22120.202\n\n\u03be = 2.988\n\n\u03be = \u22123.584\n\n\u03be = \u22122.957\n\n\u01eb1 = 1.263\n\n\u01eb1 = 0.214\n\n\u01eb1 = \u22120.059\n\n\u03c72min\n\n466.317\n\n465.604\n\n563.77\n\n467.718\n\n465.635\n\n465.604\n\n465.516\n\nk\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\u03c72min /dof\n\n1.172\n\n1.176\n\n1.424\n\n1.181\n\n1.176\n\n1.176\n\n1.176\n\n\u2206BIC\n\n0\n\n11.265\n\n109.431\n\n13.379\n\n11.296\n\n11.265\n\n11.177\n\n\u2206AIC\n\n0\n\n3.287\n\n101.453\n\n5.401\n\n3.318\n\n3.287\n\n3.199\n\nRank\n\n1\n\n3\u223c4\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n3\u223c4\n\n2\n\nTABLE I: Summarizing all the 7 models considered in this work. Here, we label the type I models characterized\nby f (a) = f0 a\u03be , f (a) = f0 + \u03be(1 \u2212 a) with the condition \u03be \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\nm0 , and f (a) = f0 + \u03be(1 \u2212 a) without the\ncondition \u03be \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\nm0 as IPL, ICPLw and ICPLwo, respectively. Also, we label the type II models characterized\nby \u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 a\u01eb1 , \u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 + \u01eb1 (1 \u2212 a), and \u01eb(a) = \u01eb0 + \u01eb1 ln a as IIPL, IICPL and IILog, respectively.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this work, we considered the cosmological constraints on the interacting dark energy models. We\ngeneralized the models considered previously by Guo et al. [15], Costa and Alcaniz [16], and we have\ndiscussed two general types of models: type I models are characterized by \u03c1X /\u03c1m = f (a) and f (a) can\nbe any function of scale factor a, whereas type II models are characterized by \u03c1m = \u03c1m0 a\u22123+\u01eb(a) and\n\u01eb(a) can be any function of a. We obtained the cosmological constraints on the type I and II models with\npower-law, CPL-like, logarithmic f (a) and \u01eb(a) by using the latest observational data.\nSome remarks are in order. Firstly, here we briefly justify the interaction forms considered in the\npresent work. We take type I models as examples. For the power-law case with f (a) = f0 a\u03be in Eq. (23),\nnoting that in the case without interaction \u03c1X \u221d a\u22123(1+wX ) and \u03c1m \u221d a\u22123 , from definition Eq. (9),\nit is reasonable to parameterize f (a) = \u03c1X /\u03c1m \u221d a\u03be , where \u03be measures the severity of the coincidence\nproblem [14, 15]. For the CPL case with f (a) = f0 + \u03be(1 \u2212 a) in Eq. (26) and the logarithmic case with\nf (a) = f0 + \u03be ln a in Eq. (29), noting that the Taylor series expansion of any function F (x) is given by\nF (x) = F (x0 ) + F1 (x \u2212 x0 ) + (F2 / 2!) (x \u2212 x0 )2 + (F3 / 3!) (x \u2212 x0 )3 + . . . , the CPL and logarithmic cases\ncan be regarded as the Taylor series expansion of f with respect to the scale factor a and the e-folding\ntime N = ln a up to first order (linear expansion), similar to the well-known EoS parameterizations\nw(a) = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a) and w(z) = w0 + w1 z.\nSecondly, we would like to briefly consider the comparison of these models. For convenience, we also\nconsider the well-known \u039bCDM model in addition. Fitting \u039bCDM model to the observational data\nconsidered in the present work, it is easy to find the corresponding best-fit parameter \u03a9m0 = 0.278,\nwhereas \u03c72min = 466.317. A conventional criterion for model comparison in the literature is \u03c72min /dof ,\nin which the degree of freedom dof = N \u2212 k, whereas N and k are the number of data points and the\nnumber of free model parameters, respectively. We present the \u03c72min /dof for all the 7 models in Table I.\nOn the other hand, there are other criterions for model comparison in the literature, such as Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The BIC is defined by [33, 35]\nBIC = \u22122 ln Lmax + k ln N ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere Lmax is the maximum likelihood. In the Gaussian cases, \u03c72min = \u22122 ln Lmax . So, the difference in\nBIC between two models is given by \u2206BIC = \u2206\u03c72min + \u2206k ln N . The AIC is defined by [34, 35]\nAIC = \u22122 ln Lmax + 2k .\n\n(40)\n\nThe difference in AIC between two models is given by \u2206AIC = \u2206\u03c72min + 2\u2206k. In Table I, we also present\n\n\f14\nthe \u2206BIC and \u2206AIC of all the 7 models considered in this work. Notice that \u039bCDM has been chosen\nto be the fiducial model when we calculate \u2206BIC and \u2206AIC. From Table I, it is easy to see that the\nrank of models is coincident in all the 3 criterions (\u03c72min /dof , BIC and AIC). The \u039bCDM model is the\nbest one, whereas ICPLw model is the worst one. This result is consistent with the one obtained in\ne.g. [35]. However, it is well known that \u039bCDM model is plagued with the cosmological constant problem\nand the coincidence problem (see e.g. [1]). On the other hand, as mentioned in the beginning of Sec. I,\nthere are some observational evidences for the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and\nthe coincidence problem can be alleviated in the interacting dark energy models. Therefore, it is still\nworthwhile to study the interacting dark energy models.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for quite useful suggestions, which help us to improve this work.\nWe are grateful to Professors Rong-Gen Cai and Shuang Nan Zhang for helpful discussions.
