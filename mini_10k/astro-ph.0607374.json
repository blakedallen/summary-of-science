Thus, there should\nbe material in the bulge to slow down these leptons,\nas well as a significant magnetic field to confine them,\nwhich is an important information since the interstellar medium in this region is very difficult to observe.\nAs far as positrons are concerned, the main characteristic to explain is their very high injection rate, i.e.\n\u223c 1.4\u00d71043 e+ s\u22121 , as deduced from the 511 keV line flux\nof (1.07 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10\u22123 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 measured by INTEGRAL/SPI [4]. Though previous instruments like SMM,\nTGRS , CGRO/OSSE gave essentially the same requirement [1], it is surprising that nobody had remarked that\ntype Ia supernovae, a long time considered the main\nsource of GB positrons, fall short explaining this high\ninjection rate [6, 7, 8]. Fortunately, this drawback is now\n\n\u2217 sizun@cea.fr\n\ntaken seriously.\nAnother clue to the origin of these GB positrons is the\nlarge extent of the emitting region, 8 \u030a FWHM [3], indicating that either they emanate from a single central\nsource or a population of sources densely packed in the\ncenter of the Galaxy and diffuse to fill the whole bulge\nregion, or there is a source population with an extension similar or greater than the GB. Indeed, the 511 keV\nemission region traces where positrons annihilate, and\nis therefore related to the distribution of the gas in the\nGalactic bulge.\nPotential astrophysical sources of positrons are numerous (SNIa, hypernovae, gamma-ray bursts, cosmic rays,\nlow mass X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars,. . . ) and\nwe will not discuss them in detail here. None of them\nqualifies to account for both the flux and morphology\nof the 511 keV emission. Some candidates are excluded\non the basis of the disk over bulge ratio [9] and others like millisecond pulsars [10] and gamma-ray bursts\n[11, 12] are shaded off, the first because the electrons\nand positrons would be injected at such energies that\ntheir Bremsstrahlung emission would be excessive, and\nthe second because their rate of appearance is insufficient\nto supply positrons at the required rate [13, 14, 15].\nIn front of this situation, two rather daring hypotheses\nhave been put forward :\n- the sources belong to the established list but there\nis something important not taken into account\nin the astrophysical scenario. Positrons from the\nGalactic disk can be transferred to the bulge where\nthey annihilate [9]. However, the transport mecha-\n\n\f2\nnism from the disk to the center is poorly known,\ndepending critically on the topology and strength of\nthe large scale magnetic field and on the diffusion\ncoefficient of low energy positrons in the relevant\nmagnetic field [4, 11];\n\n- new sources or mechanisms are required, which are\nnot in the catalog. We will consider this second\nproposal, and more specifically the light dark matter (hereafter LDM) scenario [6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19].\nOther exotica from the particle physics community\ninclude Q balls [20], relic particles [21], decaying\naxinos [22], primordial black holes [23], color superconducting dark matter [24], superconducting cosmic strings [25], dark energy stars [26], and moduli\ndecays [27]; they will not be discussed here.\nSurprisingly, though the 511 keV emission from the GB\nwas first detected more than thirty years ago, it is only\nwith the SPI observations that a great deal of imagination and activity has been triggered among the astroparticle community.\nIn this contribution, we gather \u03b3-ray observations performed by the CGRO (COMPTEL, EGRET) and INTEGRAL (IBIS/ISGRI, SPI) missions and see what constraints they set on the LDM candidate. A note of warning however: since we are interested in diffuse radiation,\nthe delicate problems of unresolved sources, particularly\nacute at low energies, and of alternate diffuse sources\nshould always be kept in mind.\nWe do not focus on the theoretical morphology of the\nLDM emission [19, 28], which is a thorny subject. It\nfirst depends on the dark matter distribution, which is\nnot well established, varies considerably from one author\nto the other [see e.g. 29, 30] and could furthermore be\nclumpy. It also depends on the complex spatial propagation of the leptons resulting from LDM annihilation\nand on the distribution of the ISM matter with which\nthey interact, also poorly known. Therefore, we use the\nmorphological information we dispose of, i.e. that of the\nradiation from positron annihilations occurring at rest,\nas observed by INTEGRAL in the 511 keV line and the\northo-positronium continuum.\nWe content ourselves to calculate the total secondary\nemission of electrons and positrons in the course of their\npropagation, the only free parameter being the mass of\nthe LDM particle. Energy losses are central to the problem, since all cross-sections of interest depend on energy,\nexcept internal Bremsstrahlung associated to the pair\nproduction. We then combine the resulting global theoretical spectra with our morphological assumptions to\nconfront them to observations. The main difficulty is not\ntheoretical, but observational: it will be to separate the\nbulge emission in the continuum from that of the disk,\ndue to cosmic rays.\n\nII.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhen colliding in the central part of the Galaxy, LDM\nparticles \u03c7, with mass m\u03c7 < 200 MeV, are expected\nto annihilate into e\u2212 \u2212 e+ pairs. The total energy imparted to the pair is equal to twice this mass m\u03c7 , still\nunknown. Internal Bremsstrahlung in the course of the\npair production [31, 32] produces a continuous spectrum\nindependent of the density of the surrounding medium.\nDue to the mass limitations, both electrons and positrons\nare intrinsically of modest energy and their energy losses\n(proportional to the interstellar density) are mainly due\nto Coulomb interactions with the surrounding medium.\nIn the course of their propagation, they mainly radiate\nthrough the (external) Bremsstrahlung process. Moreover, the released positrons are deemed to annihilate with\nambient electrons, producing a definite \u03b3-ray signature\n(511 keV line plus a low energy continuum). Positron annihilation can occur in flight [33] -in 26% of the cases at\nmost, for m\u03c7 = 200 MeV- or at rest -mostly through\npositronium formation. Thus, through the combination\nof these various mechanisms, a specific \u03b3-ray spectrum,\nwith a discrete and continuous component, is produced\nby positrons between their creation and their annihilation.\nOur aim is to set an upper limit to the mass of the\nLDM particle self-consistently, by computing this spectrum and confronting it to the observations in the relevant energy range, i.e. between \u223c 10 keV and 200 MeV.\nFrom the particle physics point of view this new constraint, combined with distinct and independent ones\ncoming from big-bang nucleosynthesis [34], type Ia supernovae, the extra-Galactic hard X-ray and soft \u03b3-ray\nbackground [19, 35], should help finding a candidate with\nthe appropriate mass and annihilation cross-section properties.\n\nIII.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe develop a simple steady-state model adequate for\nthe low energies we are considering, making the reasonable assumption that electrons and positrons below 200\nMeV are efficiently confined to the GB, where they annihilate, due to their small gyroradius -a common hypothesis in this field. We also consider that the only\npositrons present in the GB are produced in situ, at variance with Prantzos [9], who speculates that there could\nbe a transfer of positrons from the disk to the bulge. This\ndaring possibility is very hypothetical since the magnetic\nfield of the Galaxy at large scales and the propagation of\nlow energy positrons are poorly known, as admitted by\nPrantzos himself. Our problem involves simple physics,\nrepeatedly employed for instance in solar flares physics\n([36] and references therein) and Galactic physics [37],\nand various cross-sections that should be carefully chosen.\n\n\f3\nSteady-state equilibrium\n\nWe consider mono-energetic positrons of total energy\nEinj injected in the GB at a rate Rinj . As they travel\nthrough the interstellar medium, they loose energy to\nthe ambient medium and can undergo in-flight annihilation.

As their importance varies with the positron's energy, it is mandatory to use refined energy loss rates. For\nthe range of injection energies we are interested in (up to\n200 MeV at most), we can limit ourselves to ionization\nand Bremsstrahlung.\nWe stress that the ionization degree xi = nHII /nH\nin the region of propagation, where nH is the hydrogen number density, is of prime importance for the estimate of Coulomb losses [38], since at a given energy\nthey are several times weaker in a neutral medium than\nin a plasma.\n\n1.\n\nRadiation spectra\nPositron radiation\n\nThe total radiation spectrum due to positrons is the\nsum of five components: the 511 keV line from e+ -e\u2212\nannihilation at rest and from para-positronium decay\ninto two gamma rays (i), the ortho-positronium spectrum from its 3\u03b3 decay (ii), the continuous spectrum\nfrom e+ -e\u2212 in-flight annihilation into 2\u03b3 (iii), the radiation spectra associated with Bremsstrahlung energy\nlosses (iv) and with the internal Bremsstrahlung taking\nplace in the annihilation process of the dark matter particle (v).\nThe flux from 2\u03b3 annihilation at rest F 2\u03b3 is tuned\nvia the injection rate Rinj to the value of (1.07 \u00b1\n0.03) 10\u22123 ph/cm2 /s deduced from INTEGRAL obser-\n\n\f4\nEe +\nEe +\nEe +\nEe +\nEe +\n\nd\u03c3IA\n[cm2]\ndk\n\n10-25\n\ninjection rate:\n\n= 1.000 MeV\n= 5.000 MeV\n= 10.000 MeV\n= 50.000 MeV\n= 100.000 MeV\n\n1\ndF IB\n1 d\u03c3 IB\n=\ndE\u03b3\n4\u03c0d2GC \u03c3tot dE\u03b3\n\nwhere we use the differential cross-section first derived\nby Beacom et al.

While\nexternal Bremsstrahlung becomes the main component\nat very low energies, it is negligible compared to both\nin flight annihilation and internal Bremsstrahlung above\n1 MeV, which we will show to be the most constraining\nenergy domain. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the total\nspectrum with increasing injection energies and the influence of the ionization fraction.\nUsing a multi-component model of the interstellar\nmedium (molecular, cold, warm neutral, warm ionized,\nhot), Jean et al. [4] showed, through their analysis of the\n511 keV line and the ortho-positronium spectrum, that\n51+3\n\u22122 % of the rest annihilation takes place in the warm\nionized phase of the ISM. We can assume that the mean\ndegree of ionization of the medium where the thermalizing positrons propagate ranges between 0 and 51%. We\nconsider both extreme cases; the latter one enables us to\nrelease constraints on the mass of the dark matter particle.\nIV.\n\nCONFRONTATION TO OBSERVATIONS\n\nIn section III, we computed the total diffuse \u03b3-ray flux\ncaused by the production, interactions and annihilation\nof positrons and electrons coming from the annihilation of\na LDM particle (hereafter the LDM flux). We now would\nlike to use observations by INTEGRAL (ISGRI and SPI)\nand CGRO (COMPTEL and EGRET) to derive some\nconstraints on the mass of this particle. The computed\nflux stands for the GB, in which we assume that positrons\n(and associated electrons) are produced and trapped.\n\n\f5\nGalactic diffuse emission, diffuse emission from the\ninteraction of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) with the\ninterstellar medium and a component due to -\nstill- unresolved point sources.\n\nTotal\n+\nBe\nIA\nIB\n2\u03b3\n3\u03b3\nBe\n\nE dF [ph cm-2 s-1]\ndE\n\n10-3\n\nA.\n\nObservational data\n\n10-4\n\n10-5\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\nE [MeV]\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: Light dark matter (Einj =10 MeV) radiation spectra:\npositron annihilation spectra (in-flight: IA; 2\u03b3 at rest; 3\u03b3 at\nrest), positron energy loss spectra (internal Bremsstrahlung:\nIB; Bremsstrahlung: B e+ ), electron Bremsstrahlung spectrum (B e\u2212 ) and total spectrum (plain).\n\nE dF [cm-2 s-1]\ndE\n\n10-2\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10-4\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\nE [MeV]\n\n10\n\n102\n\nFIG. 4: Total dark matter radiation spectrum for increasing injection energies Einj (1, 3, 5, 10, 50 and 100 MeV).\nIn a partially ionized medium (red dotted curves), higher\nenergy losses through ionization lead to lower external\nBremsstrahlung fluxes than in a completely neutral medium\n(black solid curves).\n\nTherefore, we would like to show, for each possible\ninjection energy of the positrons :\n(i) whether the available data should and do display\nan excess in the bulge region with respect to the\nsurrounding Galactic plane;\n(ii) whether the total predicted flux exceeds the observed one, taking other gamma-ray diffuse components into account. The latter include extra-\n\nWe consider the available measurements for diffuse\nemission in the 20 keV to 200 MeV energy range (data\npoints in Fig. 5 and 7).\nAnalyzing the INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI data,\nKrivonos et al. [44] computed the Galactic ridge X-ray\nspectrum in the 17 to 200 keV range using the imager\nIBIS as a collimated telescope. They derived the residual\nemission from the total field of view remaining after subtraction of the instrumental background and of resolved\npoint sources. Considering the \u223c 19 \u030a width of the 50%\ncoded field of view, we will be able to compare the fluxes\nthey derived to models of a 20 \u030a wide region around\nthe Galactic center. Below \u223c 60 keV, there remains\na residual flux unexplained by resolved point sources.\nWhether this flux is due to truly diffuse emission or\ncan be attributed to a population of unresolved sources,\nlike Galactic pulsars, is still matter of debate. Above\n60 keV, no residual flux is detected but 2\u03c3 upper limits\non the possible unresolved emission have been set for\nthree energy bands up to \u223c 190 keV.\nFor the diffuse emission observed by the INTEGRAL/SPI spectrometer, we use the spectrum obtained\nby Strong et al. [45] in the 18 keV to 1.018 MeV energy range. Note that it has also been studied independently by Bouchet et al. [46] who derived similar conclusions. Strong et al. proceeded by fitting the instrument's\ndata with a multi-component imaging model including\npoint sources detected by the spectrometer and a set of\nten maps with various diffuse morphologies. The sum\nof the ten diffuse components represents the map of the\nemission seen by SPI as diffuse. Strong et al. published\n([45], Tab. B.4) the fluxes of this map integrated over a\n20 \u030a\u00d720 \u030a region at the Galactic center, shown in Fig. 5\nand 7. The associated uncertainties do not include systematic effects. We will compare these fluxes to a model\nof emission in a region of the same size, as a more detailed morphology of the SPI emission inside this region\nis not available yet apart from the morphology studies\nof the para-positronium and 511 keV annihilation components. We notice a discrepancy between the SPI and\nISGRI diffuse spectra. This gap could be explained by\nthe imager's better ability to detect faint point sources,\nconsidered as diffuse by SPI. However, there might be a\nneed for a more profound analysis.\nFor CGRO/COMPTEL, we will start from the\nintensity skymaps of diffuse emission produced by\nStrong et al. [47] in the 1-3, 3-10 and 10-30 MeV energy\nbands. These maps are available with a resolution of 1 \u030a.\nAfter subtracting a zero level deduced from high latitudes, we compute total fluxes in regions of variable sizes.\n\n\f6\n\nB.\n\nLDM morphology hypothesis\n\nOur model does not include spatial diffusion but simply assumes that positrons injected in the Galactic bulge\nremain confined to it; therefore, we have no detailed information on the morphology of the LDM emission. However, analysis of the SPI data showed that the 511 keV\ncomponent is compatible with a 8 \u030a FWHM Gaussian\nspatial distribution [3] and that the ortho-positronium\ncontinuum component had a similar spatial distribution\n[50]. Thus, we can safely assume that the rest of the LDM\nemission, e.g. radiation emitted during the injection and\nthermalization phases, comes from the same region or a\nsmaller one.\nWhen considering a 20 \u030a\u00d720 \u030a region, we do not need\nto make a strong assumption on the morphology of inflight annihilation and we can use the total LDM flux\ncomputed in section III. Conversely, when considering a\nsmaller region, we assume an LDM morphology following a Gaussian distribution with an 8 \u030a FWHM and we\nscale the total LDM flux by the appropriate fraction corresponding to the solid angle subtended by this region.\nIn a first step, we use the 20 \u030a\u00d720 \u030a region which is the\nsmallest one for which data for all four instruments are\navailable. In a second step, we only use the COMPTEL\ndata, which bring the most constraining information, and\nwe consider circular regions of 5, 8 and 14.6 \u030a of diameter corresponding to regions covering respectively 24, 50\nand 90% of the LDM flux. Such smaller regions include\nless diffuse background from cosmic-ray interaction and\nenable to enhance the signal to background ratio, leading\nto more stringent constraints.\n\nC.\n\nFull model approach\n\nThe main problem when comparing LDM theoretical\nemission to the data is to estimate the other diffuse components, mainly the emission due to interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. In this paragraph,\nwe adopt the approach consisting in reproducing the observations using a complete model.\n\nISGRI\nSPI\nCOMPTEL\nEGRET\nxi = 0\nxi = 51%\n\n10-2\n\nE dF [cm-2 s-1]\ndE\n\nData points in Fig. 5 and 7 correspond to a 20 \u030a\u00d720 \u030a\nregion, for mere compatibility with the ISGRI and SPI\nobservations. Uncertainties on these maps are largely\ndominated by systematic effects; an estimation based on\nlocal fluctuations at high latitudes leads to uncertainties\nof at least 30% [47, 48]. Hence, for all sizes of our integration region, we consider the COMPTEL flux uncertainty\nto be 30%.\nWe also consider CGRO/EGRET \u03b3-ray measurements\n[49] above 30 MeV ; the fluxes of data points in Fig. 5 and\n7 are obtained by subtracting the isotropic extra-Galactic\ncomponent to longitude profiles and integrating them on\nour region of study; associated systematic uncertainties\namount to \u223c15 to 20%.\n\n10-3\n\n10-4\n-10 < l < +10 deg\n-10 < b < +10 deg\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n1\nE [MeV]\n\n10\n\n102\n\nFIG. 5: Comparison between the total diffuse spectrum expected from a 20 \u030a wide region at the Galactic center and the\ndiffuse fluxes measured by IBIS (Krivonos et al. 2006 [44];\nmagenta), SPI (Strong et al. 2005 [45]; blue), COMPTEL\n(Strong et al. 1999 [47]; green) and EGRET (Hunter et al.\n1997 [49]; cyan). The model curves are the sum of the CR\ninteractions component computed by Strong et al. [45] (lower\nblack line), and the dark matter related component, computed in \u00a7 III for injection energies Einj = 1, 3, 5, 10, 50\nand 100 MeV, in a neutral (black solid curves) or 51% ionized\nmedium (red dashed curves).\n\nWe consider the GALPROP code developed by Strong\net al. [45, 51] to model the cosmic-ray propagation and\nthe associated \u03b3-ray production. The total CR gammaray emission is composed of three main components :\nBremsstrahlung scattering, the inverse Compton effect,\nand pion decays. The relative importance of these components varies with energy.\nFig. 5 shows, for a 20 \u030a\u00d720 \u030a region, the spectra of the\ntotal diffuse emission expected. They sum up the radiation from CRs, obtained by integration of the GALPROP\n(version 600203a) skymaps, and the total LDM \u03b3-ray\nflux, for various positron injection energies reflecting the\nLDM particle mass. For each injection energy, both\nthe completely neutral propagation medium case and the\n51% ionized medium case are illustrated.\nThe GALPROP model reliably reproduces the measured\ndiffuse spectrum over a wide energy range, from tens of\nMeV to hundreds of GeV. In particular, it reproduces the\nEGRET measurements satisfactorily, mostly through the\npion decay bump. On the contrary, at lower energies, this\nCR model fails to account by itself for all of the detected\ndiffuse emission. Assuming that this model still correctly\npredicts the diffuse emission due to cosmic-ray interactions below 30 MeV, this leaves room for diffuse emission\nfrom a different origin or for unresolved point sources. In\nthis section, we tentatively adopt the hypothesis that all\nof the discrepancy in the bulge between the data and the\nGALPROP model is due to the sole LDM emission.\nThen, Fig. 5 permits us to derive for each instrument\nconstraints on the maximum mass of the LDM particle.\nWith a 95% confidence level, in the more stringent case\nof a neutral medium, we exclude LDM particles with\nmasses greater than \u223c70 MeV/c2 using the ISGRI up-\n\n\f7\nper limits, 200 MeV/c2 using the SPI flux above the\n511 keV line, 25 MeV/c2 using the 10-30 MeV COMPTEL flux. For EGRET, the cosmic-ray interaction models suffice to explain the measurements; no additional\ndiffuse component such as in-flight annihilation or internal Bremsstrahlung is required, which sets the maximum\nLDM particle mass to the lower energy boundary of the\ninstrument of 30 MeV.\nBut the hypothesis adopted that all of the discrepancy\nbetween the data and the GALPROP model in the Galactic\nbulge is due to the sole LDM emission suffers from the\nfact that the same discrepancy can also be noticed in the\nGalactic disk, as depicted in Fig. 6. The longitude profile\nof the COMPTEL flux in the 3-10 MeV band is rather\nflat, shows no excess in the bulge region that could be\nidentified as a signature of LDM radiation. In order to\nfill the gap between the data and the GALPROP model in\nthe bulge with LDM radiation, we would need to simultaneously explain the outer disk deficit, by adding another\nmodel component from a totally different origin which\nwould be present only outside the Galactic bulge region.\nSuch an hypothesis seems unrealistic.\nAdditional tuning of the GALPROP model permits to\nenhance the predicted CR flux in the COMPTEL energy range, notably by using a less conventional model\nwith a rapid upturn in the CR electron spectrum [52, 53].\nHowever, this idea causes energetic problems and has no\nnatural motivation : while the origin of the discrepancy\nwith the data is still debated, a population of unresolved\nsources is more likely [53]. Moreover, such a model would\nexplain the COMPTEL observations over the whole longitude range. Thus, we should derive our constraints\nsimply through the absence of any excess in the bulge\nwith respect to the disk in the COMPTEL data.\n\nD.\n\nEmpirical approach\n\nIn this paragraph, we drop the idea of using a full\nmodel approach which, as discussed previously, has the\ndrawback of leaving completely out of consideration the\nfact that, outside the energy range of the positronium [50]\nand the 511 keV line [3], no continuum excess has been\ndetected in the bulge with respect to the surrounding\nGalactic plane.\nTherefore, taking note of the more disc-like than bulgelike morphology suggested by COMPTEL skymaps and\nprofiles above 1 MeV, we assume that most of the emission detected by both COMPTEL and SPI have their\norigin in either unresolved faint point sources or diffuse\nmechanisms other than those related to LDM particles.\nAssuming a relative uniformity of this \u03b3-ray background\nalong the Galactic plane, we derive the mean COMPTEL\nintensity in a wide region (|l| < 30\u25e6 , |b| < 5\u25e6 ) and use it\nas an estimate of background for smaller regions. An additional signal caused by LDM particles is then searched\nas an excess over this background which should remain\nwithin data uncertainties. This approach, also used by\n\nBeacom and Y\u00fcksel [33], is illustrated in the right panel\nof Fig. 6.\nFig. 7 displays total diffuse radiation spectra. The\nLDM radiation spectra, for various positron injection energies, have been added to a powerlaw spectrum based on\nthe data itself, at variance with Fig. 5 where the GALPROP\ncosmic-ray induced spectrum was used as a baseline. We\ntook the powerlaw derived for the complete SPI unresolved spectrum by Strong et al. [45],\n\ndF\nE \u22121.82\u00b10.08 \u22122 \u22121\n= (1.39\u00b10.27) 10\u22123(\n)\ncm s MeV\u22121 ,\ndE\nMeV\n(12)\nwhich is remarkably compatible with the COMPTEL\ndata points. This figure still covers a 20 \u030a\u00d720 \u030a region to\ndisplay the ISGRI and SPI data points. However, in order to derive constraints, different sizes of the integration\nregion will be taken into account.\nFor this purpose, we consider the 1-3, 3-10 and 1030 MeV COMPTEL energy bands, which are the most\nconstraining. Fig. 8 illustrates the constraints on the\nLDM particle mass obtained when using an 8 \u030a diameter\nregion. It displays, as a function of the positron injection energy and for each energy band, the sum of the total\nCOMPTEL flux and of the LDM radiation flux, scaled\nby a factor 50% corresponding to the fraction of the total LDM radiation coming from this region under our\nassumption that LDM radiation follows a spatial distribution identical to that of the observed 511 keV line, i.e.\nan 8 \u030a FWHM Gaussian. The 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 upper values\non the COMPTEL fluxes are also shown. By excluding\ninjection energies yielding a total COMPTEL + LDM\nflux exceeding the 2\u03c3 COMPTEL upper values, we derive the maximum mass of the LDM particle at a 95%\nconfidence level. The results are given in Tab. I, together\nwith constraints obtained by considering smaller or larger\nregions, for both the case of a completely neutral propagation medium and a medium with an ionization fraction\nof 51%.\nIn the case of a neutral medium, we set a maximum\nof \u223c 4 MeV on the positron injection energy with the\nintegration region covering the FWHM of the emission.\nWhen taking a 5 \u030a diameter, corresponding to 25% of the\nLDM flux, we maximize the signal to background ratio\nand obtain results similar to those of Beacom and Y\u00fcksel\n[33] : a maximum mass of \u223c 3 MeV/c2 for the light dark\nmatter particle. The precise limit depends on the not\nso well known uncertainties on the COMPTEL measurements.\nThe value of the fraction of ionized phase in the\nmedium the positrons propagate through has a small\nbut not negligible influence on our LDM particle mass\nconstraints. By assuming an ionization fraction of 51%,\nthose constraints can be released by a factor of approximately two (details in Tab.

The table gives\nthe 2\u03c3 (95% confidence) maximum energies deduced from the\n1-3, 3-10 and 10-30 MeV COMPTEL measurements respectively, for four different integration regions (5, 8 and 14.6 \u030a\ndiameter, 20 \u030a width), including 24%, 50%, 90% or 99% of\nthe LDM emission respectively -under the assumtion that\npositron in-flight annihilation has a morphology similar to\nthat of annihilation at rest.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCombining all the radiation components related to\nLDM particles -mostly in-flight annihilation and internal Bremsstrahlung- we were able to set an upper bound\nof 3 to 7.5 MeV on the mass of these particles, based\nmostly on COMPTEL data.\nA previous study by Beacom and Y\u00fcksel [33] had concluded on a 3 MeV/c2 upper mass. All in all, this work\nshows essential agreement with their result; no inconsistencies were found when making similar assumptions.\nMore conservative morphology choices lead to slightly\nlarger values but the effect of the ionization fraction of\nthe ISM is more noticeable. Arguably, there seems to be a\ntension between the lower limit established through the\nconstraint of supernovae explosions [17] and the upper\nlimit based on in flight annihilation ([33] and this work),\nbut a definite exclusion of the LDM hypothesis is premature, since the discussion on the uncertainties on the\nmeasurements in the COMPTEL energy band, which are\nof crucial importance, is rather qualitative. To advance\nin this context, a refined reassessment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties on fluxes in COMPTEL\nmaps would certainly prove to be useful.

Instead of taking the predictions from cosmic-ray\ninteraction codes as a base level for our LDM model like in Fig. 5, we now use a powerlaw (blue straight line) \u03b3-ray background\n-already displayed in Fig. 5- compatible with both SPI and COMPTEL data.\n\nnitely excluding a light dark matter particle of mass less\nthan about 10 MeV/c2 , further observations of the Galactic bulge region with INTEGRAL/SPI are mandatory to\nget additional morphological information and refined uncertainties on diffuse emission in the 511 keV to 1 MeV\nenergy domain.\nWe stressed the influence of the ionization degree of\nthe interstellar medium on the amplitude of the in-flight\nradiation spectrum : taking into account the ionization\nfraction of the propagation region could allow values of\nthe mass of the LDM particle larger by up to a factor two.\nHowever, additional modeling work is required to ascertain in which phases positrons propagate during their\nthermalization phase.\nThe present conclusions were derived under the demanding assumption that light dark matter annihilation\nalone accounts for all of the 511 keV line. A multi-source\nscenario would enable us to reduce the amplitude of the\nLDM \u03b3-ray continuum and to release once again the limit\non the LDM particle mass.\nThis work focuses on the LDM hypothesis; however,\nby leaving the internal Bremsstrahlung component aside,\nthe model presented can be applied to the more general\ncase of \u03b3-ray radiation from any mono-energetic source\nof positrons.\nProspects In order to further restrict the LDM particle mass range with the INTEGRAL satellite, a refined\nappraisal of the contribution of faint point sources in the\n50-511 keV energy range is required. In this perspective,\nthe new census of sources found by the imager above\n\n100 keV [54] will be paramount to fine-tune ISGRI upper limits on diffuse emission. Because the spectrometer does not have the capacity to resolve as many faint\nsources, an increased recognition of ISGRI detections in\nthe analysis of SPI data might prove necessary.\nBeyond flux considerations, whose precision is hindered by our uncertain knowledge of the radiation from\ncosmic-ray interactions and unresolved sources, morphology studies will be a key point to find out whether the\n511 keV to 8 MeV energy range presents a faint excess\nin the GB.\nIn order to take all aspects of LDM into account, the\npresent model could be extended to include spatial diffusion of positrons and electrons during thermalization\nand model the differences in the morphologies of the\nLDM emission at various energies. Furthermore, studying the influence of the in-flight annihilation and internal Bremsstrahlung components on the positronium fraction [4] derived from SPI data would be interesting.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank A.

It should be noticed that combining the three COMPTEL energy bands instead of considering\nthem independently would bring a sensitivity improvement\nand lead to more severe exclusions; for instance, injection at\nEinj =10 MeV is excluded by the 1-3 and 3-10 MeV energy\nbands at 3.6\u03c3 and 5.6\u03c3 respectively (xi = 0), while the combination of both bands leads to a 6.9\u03c3 exclusion.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\nP.
