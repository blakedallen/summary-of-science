They can couple indirectly via weak\ninteraction and other effects, potentially leading to significant observational effects in astrophysics [1, 2]. The\nphoton-neutrino scattering cross section predicted by the\nStandard Model is, however, exceedingly small and likely\nof little practical importance in astrophysics, see e.g. [3].\nField theories on noncommutative (NC) spaces offer a\ndifferent interaction channel for neutrinos and photons:\nSuch theories have been introduced as effective models1\nfor the quantum geometric structure of spacetime that\nis generically expected in any reasonable quantum theory of gravity (including string theory). The presence of\ngauge fields influences such noncommutative structures\nand neutrinos propagating in the modified background\nfeel the effect. The non-zero star commutator\n[A\u03bc \u22c6, \u03a8] = A\u03bc \u22c6 \u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8 \u22c6 A\u03bc .\n\n(1)\n\nis a striking illustration of this effect in noncommutative\nU\u22c6 (1) theory: Fermions that are neutral or even sterile\nin the commutative limit can nevertheless directly couple\nto a U\u22c6 (1) gauge field. In this article we shall investigate\nsuch noncommutativity induced interactions using methods that are non-perturbative in the noncommutativity\nparameters [4].\nStudies in noncommutative particle phenomenology\n[5], aiming at predicting possible experimental signatures\nand estimating bounds on space-time noncommutativity\nfrom existing experimental data, started around the time\nthat string theory indicated that noncommutative gauge\ntheory could be one of its low-energy effective theories\n\n[6]. Early attempts with simple models based on star\nproducts (with expressions like the one given above) soon\nran into several serious difficulties: (i) Such theories have\nno local gauge invariant quantities, (ii) fields like A\u03bc do\nnot transform covariantly under coordinate changes [7]\nand (iii) there are unphysical restrictions on representations and charges. These shortcomings are overcome\nin an approach based on Seiberg-Witten (SW) maps,\nwhich enables one to deform commutative gauge theories with essentially arbitrary gauge group and representation [8\u201313]. Since this approach also fixes problems\nof non-covariance under coordinate changes, we shall refer to this class of theories as covariant noncommutative\nfield theories.2 After some initial enthusiasm, renormalizability of these theories turned out to be a delicate\nissue. In [15, 16] a Dirac fermion 4-vertex was identified as one of the major culprits in this issue. This\nvertex is absent in theories with chiral fermions [17, 18].\nParticularly well behaved are theories where the gauge\nfields couple via a star commutator (1) to fermions, as\nis the case in our model: Cancelations between fermion\nand boson loops lead to softened UV/IR coupling [19].\nRegardless of the question of renormalizability, SW-map\nbased models serve as effective theories for some of the\nquantum geometric effects expected in more fundamental theories such as string theory and quantum gravity.\nIn the Seiberg-Witten map approach, noncommutative\nfields A\u03bc , \u03a8,. . . and gauge transformation parameters \u039b\nare interpreted as non-local, enveloping algebra-valued\nfunctions of their commutative counterparts a\u03bc , \u03c8, \u03bb\nand of the noncommutative parameters \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd , in such a\nway that ordinary gauge transformations of the commutative fields induce noncommutative gauge transforma-\n\n2\n1\n\nThese models should be understood as effective theories and are\nnot necessarily renormalizable.\n\nAll these models are consistent, contrary to slightly misleading\nstatements in a recently published \"no-go theorem\" [14], where\na mal-constructed model is shown to lead to contradictions.\n\n\f2\ntions of the noncommutative fields. This procedure allows the construction of noncommutative extensions of\nimportant particle physics models like the NC Standard\nModel (NCSM) and GUT models [20\u201326], as well as various follow-on studies with NC modifications of particle\nphysics [27\u201334]. In more recent development, it has been\nfound that SW expanded models at first order in \u03b8 are\nwell-behaved regarding anomalies and renormalizability.\nFor example the NCSM [21] at \u03b8-order appears to be\nanomaly free [35, 36], has remarkably well-behaved oneloop quantum corrections [37] and breaks Lorentz symmetry; see also [20, 38\u201341].\nTo avoid strong backgrounds from known processes,\nconsiderable efforts in noncommutative phenomenology\nhas been directed at interactions which are suppressed\nin Standard Model settings. One important candidate or\nthis type is the aforementioned tree-level coupling of neutrinos with photons or, more precisely, plasmons. Such\ninteractions have already been studied in the framework\nof noncommutative gauge theories defined by SeibergWitten maps [42, 43]. There, like in almost all other\nstudies of covariant NC field theory, an expansion and\ncut-off in powers of the noncommutativity parameters\n\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd was used for computational simplicity. Such an expansion corresponds to an expansion in momenta (derivatives) and restrict the range of validity to energies well\nbelow the noncommutativity scale \u039bNC . This is usually\nno problem for experimental predictions because the noncommutativity parameters \u03b8ij = cij /\u039b2NC are in general\nconsidered to be small. There exists, however, exotic\nprocesses like ultra high energy cosmic rays [44] in which\nthe interacting energy scale runs higher than the current experimental bound on the noncommutative scale\n\u039bNC . Here the previously available approximate results\nare inapplicable. To overcome the \u03b8-expansion and cutoff approximation, we are using in this article \u03b8-exact expressions and expand in powers of the coupling constant\nas in ordinary gauge theory.\nThe \u03b8-exact approach has been inspired by exact formulas for the Seiberg-Witten map [12, 45\u201347]. For arbitrary non-Abelian gauge theories the \u03b8-exact approach is\nstill a challenging problem, in particular in loop computations and at higher orders in the coupling constant. Since\nperturbative renormalization and UV/IR mixing are still\nfairly poorly understood, it is not clear how to interpret\nthe quantum corrections and to relate them to observations [48, 49]. Another interesting venue for applications of \u03b8-exact methods is the investigation of quantum\ncorrections in covariant noncommutative quantum field\ntheories. Recently it was suggested [50] that noncommutative QED might be renormalizable by adding proper\ncounter-terms. A covariant \u03b8-exact version of this theory\ncould be a very interesting object for future studies. First\n\u03b8-exact results have been published in the investigation\nof UV/IR mixing in covariant NC gauge theory [4] and\nlater in the context of NC photon-neutrino phenomenology, namely scattering of ultra high energy cosmic ray\nneutrinos on nuclei [44]. Those topics were off-limits in\n\nthe old \u03b8-expansion method.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nIn this section we recall some basic facts about covariant noncommutative gauge theory based on SeibergWitten maps. We then review the derivation of \u03b8-exact\ninteraction terms and apply the method to the computation of neutrino-photon tri-particle vertices. We\nclose with a comment on an alternative covariant vertex.\nThroughout the article we shall concentrate on Abelian\nnoncommutative gauge theory.\nIt is straight-forward to formulate field theories on noncommutative spaces by inserting a star product \u22c6 between all fields in the action. This introduces ordering\nambiguities and it breaks ordinary gauge invariance (because local gauge transformations do not commute with\nstar products). In analogy to the introduction of covariant derivatives in gauge theory, the star product can be\npromoted to a gauge-field dependent covariant star product \u22c6\u2032 . Together with a gauge-field dependent covariant\nintegral measure this leads to a noncommutative gauge\ntheory. Alternatively and in fact equivalently [11, 12]\nit is possible to retain the original star product and instead promote all fields to noncommutative fields and the\ngauge transformations to noncommutative gauge transformations. In this construction the \"noncommutative\nfields\" are obtained via Seiberg-Witten maps [6] and their\ngeneralizations from the original \"commutative fields\".\nWith some field-ordering \"fine-tuning\", it is possible\nto obtain noncommutative models, were neutrinos and\nother neutral fermion fields do not couple to photons \u2013\nthe minimal NC Standard Model is an example of this\ntype. More generically, however, electrically neutral matter fields will be promoted via (hybrid) Seiberg-Witten\nmaps to noncommutative fields that couple via star commutator to photons and transform in the adjoint representation of U\u22c6 (1) \u2013 this is the case for phenomenologically promising NC GUTs. The inclusion of all gauge covariant coupling terms is furthermore a prerequisite for\nreasonable UV behavior. Taking all this into account\nwe eventually arrive at the following model of a SeibergWitten type noncommutative U\u22c6 (1) gauge theory 3 (for\nmore details, see the discussion at the end of the section)\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n\u0001\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n/\n\u2212 F F\u03bc\u03bd + i\u03a8\u0304 D \u2212 m\u03bd \u03a8 d4 x\nS=\n4\n\n(2)\n\nwith F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 i[A\u03bc \u22c6, A\u03bd ] and\nD\u03bc \u03a8 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a8 \u2212 i[A\u03bc \u22c6, \u03a8] .\n\n3\n\n(3)\n\nIn this section we set the coupling constant e = 1, to restore the\ncoupling constant one simply substitute a\u03bc by ea\u03bc , then divide\nthe gauge-field Lagrangian by e2 .\n\n\f3\nAll the fields in this action are images under (hybrid)\nSeiberg-Witten maps of the corresponding commutative\nfields a\u03bc and \u03c8. In the original work of Seiberg and Witten and in virtually all subsequent applications, these\nmaps are understood as (formal) series in powers of the\nnoncommutativity parameter \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd . Physically, this corresponds to an expansion in momenta and is valid only\nfor low-energy phenomena. Here we shall not subscribe\nto this point of view and instead interpret the noncommutative fields as valued in the enveloping algebra of the\nunderlying gauge group. This naturally corresponds to\nan expansion in powers of the gauge field a\u03bc and hence\nin powers of the coupling constant. At each order in a\u03bc\nwe shall determine \u03b8-exact expressions.\nThe expansion in powers of the commutative (gauge)\nfield content is motivated from the obvious fact that in\nperturbative quantum field theory one can sort the interaction vertices by the number of external legs and this\nis equivalent to the number of field operators in the corresponding interacting terms. For any specific process\nand loop order there exists an upper limit on the number\nof external legs. So if one expands the noncommutative\nfields with respect to the formal power of the commutative fields which are the primary fields in the theory up\nto an appropriate order, the relevant vertices in a specific\ndiagram will automatically be exact to all orders of \u03b8.\nIn tree-level neutrino-photon coupling processes only\nvertices of the form a\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 contribute, therefore an expansion to lowest nontrivial order in a\u03bc (but all orders in \u03b8)\nis enough. There are at least three known methods for\n\u03b8-exact computations: The closed formula derived using\ndeformation quantization based on Kontsevich formality\nmaps [12], the relationship between open Wilson lines in\nthe commutative and noncommutative picture [45, 47],\nand direct recursive computations using consistency conditions.

After a gauge transformation, the sum of the first and third terms equals the\nsecond term.

To extract Feynman rules in an appropriate form, we use the arithmetic property i\u03b8ij \u2202i f \u22c62 \u2202j g =\n[f \u22c6, g] to obtain the effective neutrino-photon Lagrangian\ndensity\nL = \u2212(\u03b8ij ai \u22c62 \u2202j \u03c8\u0304)(i\u2202/ \u2212 m\u03bd )\u03c8\n\n\u2212\u03c8\u0304(i\u2202/ \u2212 m\u03bd )(\u03b8ij ai \u22c62 \u2202j \u03c8)\n\u03bc\n\nij\n\n(20)\n\n2\n\n+i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 (\u03b8 \u2202i a\u03bc \u22c62 \u2202j \u03c8) + O(a \u03c8\u0304\u03c8) .\nThe rest of the derivation resembles that of NCQED\nwithout a Seiberg-Witten map. Just like the Moyal-Weyl\nstar product turns into an exponential function in momentum space, the generalized star product \u22c62 turns into\na function\nF (q, k) =\n\nsin q\u03b8k\n2\nq\u03b8k\n2\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere q and k are the momenta of the fields involved in\nthe product. We notice that for tri-field interaction, 4momentum conservation q = k\u2212k \u2032 renders the function F\nindependent of the order of momenta involved: F (q, k) =\nF (k, q) = F (k, k \u2032 ) = F (k \u2032 , k). We can hence pull out F\nas an universal factor. In the end we obtain the following\n\u03b8-exact Feynman rule for the neutrino-photon tri-particle\nvertex:\ni\nh\n\u0393\u03bc = iF (q, k) (/\nk \u2212 m\u03bd )q\u0303 \u03bc + (q\u03b8k)\u03b3 \u03bc \u2212 /qk\u0303 \u03bc , (22)\nwith the shorthand notations q\u03b8k \u2261 qi \u03b8ij kj and k\u0303 \u03bc =\n\u03b8\u03bcj kj .\nIf we compare this with to the first order in \u03b8 vertex\nthat was used in previous work, we see that only the\nfactor F (q, k) is new. Consequently, it is this factor that\nleads to modifications in \u03b8-exact computations.\nInterestingly, the first term in (22),\n\u0393\u03bcalt = iF (q, k)(/\nk \u2212 m\u03bd )q\u0303 \u03bc ,\n\n(23)\n\nis already consistent with gauge invariance on its own.\nThis simplified vertex defines an alternative NC theory\nof neutrino-photon interaction that is attractive for computations beyond tree level. In this article we will use\nthe full vertex which is more natural from the point of\nview of NC gauge theory as it is derived from a covariant\nderivative.\nThe two choices of NC vertices is ultimately related to\na choice of generalized SW map in the construction of\nthe NC theory. In the remainder of this section we shall\nexplore this construction in more detail. For simplicity of\n\npresentation we shall set e = 1 and focus on the massless\ncase.\nWe start with the action for a neutral massless free\nfermion field\nZ\nZ\n(24)\nS = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 d4 x = \u03c8\u0304 \u22c6 \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 d4 x ,\nwhere, as indicated, a Moyal-Weyl type star product can\nbe inserted or removed by partial integration. Following\nthe method of constructing a covariant NC gauge theory\noutlined at the beginning of this section, we lift the factors in the action via (generalized) Seiberg-Witten maps\n\u03a8\u0302[a\u03bc ], \u03a6\u0302[a\u03bc ] to noncommutative status as follows:\nZ\nZ\nS = \u03a8\u0302(\u03c8\u0304)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03a6\u0302(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) d4 x = \u03a8\u0302(\u03c8\u0304) \u22c6 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03a6\u0302(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) d4 x .\n(25)\nNow if the SW maps \u03a8\u0302, \u03a6\u0302 and a corresponding map \u039b\u0302\nfor the gauge parameter \u03bb satisfy\n\u03b4\u03bb (\u03a8\u0302(\u03c8\u0304)) = i[\u039b\u0302(\u03bb) \u22c6, \u03a8\u0302(\u03c8\u0304)],\n\u03b4\u03bb (\u03a6\u0302(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8)) = i[\u039b\u0302(\u03bb) \u22c6, \u03a6\u0302(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8)],\n\n(26)\n\nwe will have a noncommutative action that is gauge invariant under infinitesimal commutative gauge transformations \u03b4\u03bb and reduces to the free fermion action in the\ncommutative limit \u03b8 \u2192 0.\nThe appropriate map \u03a8\u0302 is the one (17) that we have\nalready derived:\n\u03a8\u0302(\u03c8) = \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b8ij ai \u22c62 \u2202j \u03c8 + O(a2 )\u03c8.\n\n(27)\n\nRecalling that we are dealing with neutral fields, i.e. \u03b4\u03c8 =\n0 and \u03b4(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) = 0, we notice that we can in principle use\nthe same map also for \u03a6\u0302:\n\u03a6\u0302alt (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) = \u03a8\u0302(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b8ij ai \u22c62 (\u2202j \u2202\u03bc \u03c8) + O(a2 )\u03c8 .\n(28)\nThis construction is quite unusual from the point of gauge\ntheory, as it yields a covariant derivative term without introducing a covariant derivative. In any case the resulting\naction\nZ \u0010\n\u0001\ni\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 i \u03b8ij \u2202j \u03c8\u0304 \u22c62 ai \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8\nSalt =\n(29)\n\u0001\u0011 4\n2\nij\n\u03bc\n+i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03b8 ai \u22c62 \u2202\u03bc \u2202j \u03c8 d x + O(a )\nis consistent and gauge invariant. The corresponding\nphoton-fermion interaction vertex\n\u0393\u03bcalt = iF (q, k)q\u0303 \u03bc k/\n\n(30)\n\nis surprisingly simple and therefore quite attractive for\nloop-level computations. The vertex satisfies\nq\u03bc \u0393\u03bcalt = (q * q\u0303)iF (q, k)/\nk = 0.\n\n(31)\n\nThere is, however, a second choice for \u03a6\u0302:\n\u03a6\u0302(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) = D\u03bc\u22c6 \u03a8\u0302(\u03c8) = \u2202\u03bc \u03a8\u0302(\u03c8) \u2212 i[A\u03bc \u22c6, \u03a8\u0302(\u03c8)]\n\n=\u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b8ij ai \u22c62 \u2202j \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 + \u03b8ij fi\u03bc \u22c62 \u2202j \u03c8 + O(a2 )\u03c8 ,\n\n(32)\n\n\f5\nbased on the well-known NC QED-type covariant derivative. This second choice of SW map differs from the first\none by the gauge invariant term \u03b8ij fi\u03bc \u22c62 \u2202j \u03c8, indicating a freedom in the choice of Seiberg-Witten map.

In a different\nmodel [51], it is claimed that Dirac masses for neutrinos are\nnot consistent with NC gauge invariance of the Yukawa terms.\nOur model features a vector-like interaction, since both \u03bdL and\n\u03bdR are singlets under the residual U (1)Q and Dirac mass terms\nfor neutrinos are allowed. The tree-level coupling to photons\nis experienced by both neutrino chiralities even above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. Note also that the vertex (22)\nis zero for Majorana neutrinos, unless transition electromagnetic\nmoments are invoked. In all applications we will work with neutrinos with definite chiralities, i.e. Weyl neutrinos, as the neutrino mass can be neglected.

This\nfeature is reflected in the approximately constant R = 1\ncontour for small \u03c9pl shown in Fig. 1 and gives a lower\n>\nbound \u039bNC \u223c 70 GeV, in agreement with [42], where a\nbound on \u039bNC was derived from the requirement that\nNC contributions to plasmon decay in stars should not\ngo beyond the Standard Model predictions. In practice,\nthe plasmon frequency in stars, \u03c9pl \u2243 10 keV, is too low\nto see the effect of the modified interaction (19). In the\nfollowing, we shall explore other examples.\nB.\n\nNeutrino charge radius\n\nWe make use of the full \u03b8-exact expression for the plasmon decay rate to recompute also NC neutrino charge\nradii for both chiralities. Noting [43]\n\u0393(\u03b3pl \u2192 \u03bd\u0304L \u03bdL ) =\n\n\u03b1 q6\nhr\u03bd2 i\n144 E\u03b3\n\n2\n\n(41)\n\nand using (38) we find that the \u03b8-exact NC induced neutrino charge radius is given by\n\u221a s\nsin \u03be\n6 2\n2\n.\n(42)\n1\u2212\nhr\u03bd i = lim\n2\n\u03c9pl \u21920 \u03c9\n\u03be\npl\n\nThe limit \u03c9pl \u2192 0 implies, through the dispersion rela2\ntion q 2 = \u03c9pl\n, the familiar q 2 \u2192 0 limit entering the definition of the charge radius. It is interesting to note that\nthe expansion in the plasma frequency coincides with an\nexpansion in \u03b8, because the effect of the full \u03b8-exact interaction enters only through the parameter \u03be. Therefore,\nthe limit \u03c9pl \u2192 0 picks up only the first term in (40) and\nthat corresponds to the first-order-in-\u03b8 result, as stated\nbefore. This lucky coincidence implies that there are no\n\u03b8-exact corrections to the first-order-in-\u03b8 charge radius\nthat was obtained earlier [43]:\n\u221a\n3\n2\n(43)\n|hr\u03bd i| = 2 .\n\u039bNC\nNote that the \u03b8-parameter \u2013 when interpreted as the\nlength scale of the fuzziness of spacetime which arises\nas a consequence of space-space uncertainty relations \u2013\ndirectly runs up a charge radius for a neutrino (by giving\nspatial extent to a point particle), as expected.\nWith (43) at hand, one can immediately place a constraint on \u039bNC by employing a very stringent bound\n<\non hr\u03bd2R i based on SN1987A [54]. With hr\u03bd2R i \u223c 2 \u00d7\n>\n\n10\u221233 cm2 , and using (43) one obtains \u039bNC \u223c 0.6 TeV.\nC.\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\n\nOver the past decades, BBN has established itself as\none of the most powerful available probes of physics\nbeyond the Standard Model, giving many interesting\nconstraints on particle properties (an extensive summary is available, for instance, in [55]). One uses it to\nparametrize the energy density of new relativistic particles at the time of BBN in terms of the effective number\nof additional neutrino species, \u2206N\u03bd , whose determination involves both a lower limit on the barion-to-photon\nratio (\u03b7 \u2261 nb /n\u03b3 ) as well as an upper bound on the primordial mass fraction of 4 He, Yp [56]. The energy density\nof three light right-handed (RH) neutrinos produced by\nplasmon decay during BBN is equivalent to the effective\nnumber \u2206N\u03bd of additional doublet neutrinos\n\u0012\n\u00134\nT\u03bdR\n\u2206N\u03bd = 3\n,\n(44)\nT\u03bdL\nwhere T\u03bdL is the temperature of the SM neutrinos, being the same as that of photons down to T \u223c 1 MeV. A\nbetter limit on \u2206N\u03bd leads to a smaller value of T\u03bdR and\nconsequently a higher decoupling temperature of the RH\nneutrinos. For \u2206N\u03bd = 1, one finds Tdec > TC , where TC\nis the critical temperature for the deconfinement restoration phase transition, TC \u223c 200 MeV. If \u2206N\u03bd \u2243 0.2,\nthen Tdec would be close to a critical temperature of the\nelectroweak phase transition, Tdec <\n\u223c 300 GeV. Unfortunately, with the WMAP value for \u03b7 [57], Yp was predicted to increase [58], having a tendency to loosen the\ntight bounds on \u2206N\u03bd that existed before.\n\n\f7\nThe RH neutrino is commonly considered to decouple\nat the temperature Tdec when the condition\n\u0393(\u03b3pl \u2192 \u03bd\u0304R \u03bdR ) \u2243 H(Tdec )\n\n(45)\n\nis satisfied. The plasma frequency in this case is given\nby\neTdec ch\ng\u2217 ,\n3\nwhile the Hubble expansion rate satisfies\n\n(46)\n\n\u03c9pl =\n\nH(T ) \u2243 1.66 g\u2217\n\n2\nTdec\n,\nMP l\n\n(47)\n\nwhere g\u2217 and g\u2217ch are the degrees of freedom specifying\nthe entropy of the interacting species for all and charged\nspecies, respectively; MP l is the Planck mass.\nComputing the decoupling temperature Tdec based on\nthe assumption that the decay rate (45) is solely due\nto noncommutative effects and comparing with lower\nbounds on Tdec that can be inferred from observational\ndata, we can determine lower bounds on the scale of noncommutativity \u039bNC . Proceeding in this spirit, one finds\nthat Big Bang nucleosynthesis provides the following relation between the decoupling temperature Tdec and the\nnoncommutative scale \u039bNC , assuming that (45) is fully\ndue to noncommutative contributions:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\ne2 (g\u2217ch )2 Tdec\nsin \u03be\nMP l e3 g\u2217ch\n, \u03be=\n1\u2212\n.\nTdec \u2243\n2\n39.84\u03c0g\u2217\n\u03be\n18\u039bNC\n(48)\nLet us consider the pre-factor\n1\n\n3\n\n\u03c0 2 \u03b1 2 g\u2217ch\nMP l e3 g\u2217ch\n=\nMP l ,\n39.84\u03c0g\u2217\n4.98g\u2217\n\n(49)\n\nand taking into account \u03b1 \u2243 137\u22121 , g\u2217ch /g\u2217 \u2243 1, we have\n1\n\n3\n\n\u03c0 2 \u03b1 2 g\u2217ch\nMP l \u2243 2.22 \u00d7 10\u22124 MP l .\n4.98g\u2217\n\n(50)\n\nSince this factor is amplified by the Planck mass, we can\ntest the full interaction (19) only for \u2206N\u03bd \u226a 1.

In both curves we set, for illustration purposes, g\u2217 = g\u2217ch = 100, and the logarithmic scaling of the fine structure constant with temperature is igmax\nnored. The full curve reveals Tdec\n= 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 MP l and\nmax\n\u22124\n\u039bNC = 9.4 \u00d7 10 MP l .\n\n3\n\u03c0 2 \u03b1 2 (g\u2217ch )3 MP l Tdec\n4.98 * 27g\u2217\n\n(52)\n\nNow setting further g\u2217 \u223c g\u2217ch \u223c 100, MP l = 1.22 \u00d7 1019\nGeV and Tdec > 200 MeV (quark-hadron phase transition), a lower bound on \u039bNC can be obtained as\n\u039bNC > 3.68 TeV.\n\n(53)\n\nFor Tdec > 300 GeV (eletroweak phase transition), we\nhave\n\u039bNC > 887 TeV,\n\n(54)\n\nconfirming the previous results obtained by making use\nof scattering processes of \u03bdR s [59].\nFor the sake of demonstration, we have also studied\n(48) numerically, to investigate how the plasmon rate\nobtained in the full theory affects determination of \u039bNC\nwhen Tdec \u2243 10\u22124 MP l . The relation (48) is depicted\nin Fig. 2, in which the approximate result (52) is also\nsuperimposed for comparison.\nLooking at the asymptotic behavior of the approximate\n(52) and exact (48) relations between \u039bNC and Tdec , one\nnotes that Fig. 2 reveals quite a different behavior for\nthem: While the solution of (48), obtained by employing\nthe leading order term in \u03be, shows no restriction on Tdec\nall the way up till the beginning of the radiation era, the\nsolution of (52) reveals a maximal decoupling temperature in the said epoch. (Of course, if inflation occurred\n\n\f8\nmax\nwell below Tdec\n\u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 MP l , then any distinction\nbetween the two solutions would practically disappear.)\nThis feature is accompanied by a maximal scale of noncommutativity, above which the RH neutrinos can no\nlonger retain thermal contact with the rest of the universe. This is in contrast with the exact relation (48),\nwhere thermal equilibrium is maintained for much larger\nmax\n\u039bNC 's (if inflation occurred well above Tdec\n), and stops\nwhen Tdec hits the reheating temperature. This means\nthat the effect of the full interaction (22) is to bring about\n\u22124\nthe maximal upper limit \u039bmax\nMP l , occurring\nNC \u2243 9 \u00d7 10\nmax\nat a decoupling temperature slightly below Tdec\n, which\ncan be extracted by our method. Note that for decoupling temperatures lying in a region where the oscillatory\npatterns inherent in (52) becomes manifest, it may seem\ntroublesome to infer a bound on the scale of noncommutativity since several (many) \u039bNC 's correspond to the\nsame Tdec . In these cases one chooses the highest \u039bNC ,\notherwise \u039bNC 's obtained with a much smaller decoupling\ntemperature (where the oscillatory term is shut down)\nwould give much better lower limits. Again, this characteristic is missing in the perturbative solution, where\nbetter and better limits on the NC scale are always accompanied with progressively increasing decoupling temperatures.\nNote that these ranges of Tdec are of course tremendously above the bounds that can be inferred from current observational data.\n\nD.\n\nUltrahigh Energy (UHE) Cosmic Rays\n\nThe non-observation of UHE neutrino induced events\nin neutrino observatories implies a strong modelindependent constraint on the inelastic neutrino-nucleon\ncross section [60], which consequently gives a constraint\non the scale of noncommutativity for a NC gauge-field\ntheory in which neutrinos couple directly to photons [44].\nIt was observed [44] that at energies as high as 1011 GeV,\nthe usual expansion in \u03b8 is no longer meaningful. In order to fix the breakdown in the perturbative expansion,\na resummation in the neutrino-photon vertex was undertaken [44]. Although devoid of a firm theoretical background and with only the zeroth order in the SeibergWitten map employed, this ad hoc approach did produce\nthe correct sin term that we have now obtained, redoing\nthe computation using the \u03b8-exact vertex (22).\nCuriously enough, (22) can be put in a much simpler\nform if the NC vertex connects external (on-shell) neutrino lines. Indeed, with the aid of the Dirac equation\nfor free fields, the first term in (22) vanishes if one line\nis on-shell, while the third term in (22) vanishes if both\nlines are on-shell. Thus, for tree-level processes with no\ninternal neutrino lines, (22) reduces to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u03b8k\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n.\n(55)\n\u0393 = 2i e \u03b3 sin\n2\nThis exactly coincides with the result [44] obtained with\n\nthe ad-hoc method. This way, the powerful bounds on\n\u039bNC obtained there, in the range 200-900 TeV (depending on a model for the cosmogenic neutrino flux), get\nfurther credence as far as the underlying theoretical background is concerned. Note, though, that (55) should\nnot be used to calculate tree-level processes with internal\nneutrino lines, nor in calculations involving loops. Hence,\nif one is, for instance, to study the UV/IR mixing in the\nneutrino sector, then the complete expression as given by\n(22) should be used.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we showed that the tree-level tri-particle\ndecay \u03b3pl \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 in the covariant noncommutative quantum gauge theory based on Seiberg-Witten maps can be\ncomputed without an expansion over the noncommutative parameter \u03b8. As an application, we focus on plasmon decay into neutrinos, reconsidering previous computations that were done with less sophisticated tools and\nderiving new bounds on the scale of noncommutativity.\nComparing to previous results, the total decay rate is\nmodified by a factor which remains finite throughout all\nenergy scales. Thus the new results behave much better than the \u03b8-expansion method when ultra high energy\nprocesses are considered. We expect that similar control\non the high energy behavior can be extended to \u03b8-exact\nperturbation theory involving more than three external\nfields in the near future. This would provide a considerably improved theoretical basis for research work in the\nfield of noncommutative particle phenomenology.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nJ.T. would like to acknowledege support of W.
