More recently, absorption cross sections have been of interest in the context\nof higher-dimensional string theories.\nIn a series of papers [2, 3, 4] Sanchez considered the scattering and absorption of massless\nscalar particles by an uncharged, spherically-symmetric black hole. Unruh [5] studied the\nabsorption of massive spin-half particles by piecing together analytic solutions to the Dirac\nequation across three regions. He showed that, in the low-energy limit, the scattering cross\nsection for the fermion is exactly 1/8 of that for the scalar particle. Doran et al. [6]\nstudied the absorption of massive spin-half particles by a small Schwarzschild black hole by\nnumerically solving the single-particle Dirac equation in Painlev\u00e9\u2013Gullstrand coordinates.\nIn Ref. [7], Das et al. computed the low-energy absorption cross section for minimally\ncoupled massless scalars and spin-half particles, into a general spherically symmetric black\nhole in arbitrary dimensions. It is interesting to note for extremal black holes, the absorption\ncross section for minimally coupled fermion vanishes in the limit of extremality. In 2005,\nJung, Kim and Park [8] computed the ratio of the low-energy absorption cross section for\nDirac fermion to that for minimally coupled scalar when the spacetimes are various types of\nthe higher-dimensional spherically symmetric black holes. They found that the low-energy\nabsorption cross section for the Dirac fermion always goes to zero in the extremal limit\nregardless of the detailed geometry of the spacetime. So, there should be some relation\nbetween the low-energy absorption cross section for minimally coupled fermions and the\ntopology of spherically symmetric black holes. In this paper we will consider the relation\nbetween them.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, using the Gauss\u2013Bonnet\u2013Chern (GBC)\ntheorem, the Euler characteristic and the low-energy absorption cross section for Dirac\nfermions of both the extremal and nonextremal spherically symmetric black holes are briefly\nreviewed. Some useful notations are also prepared. In Section III, from the opinion of the\ndecomposition of spin connection, the density of the absorption cross section of spherically\nsymmetric black holes is proposed in terms of the smooth unit tangent vector field. Then, in\nSection IV, using the \u03c6-mapping method [9], the topology of the absorption cross section is\n2\n\n\finvestigated at the singularities of the unit vector field. In Section V, we compute the value\nof the Hopf index for several example spacetimes. The conclusion of this paper is given in\nSection VI.\n\nII.\n\nTHE EULER CHARACTERISTIC AND THE ABSORPTION CROSS SEC-\n\nTION FOR DIRAC FERMION OF SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC BLACK HOLES\n\nLet us consider the general spherically symmetric metric in (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime\nof the form\n\u0001\nds2 = f (r\u0302)dt2 \u2212 g(r\u0302) dr\u0302 2 + r\u0302 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n(1)\n\nlim f (r\u0302) = lim g(r\u0302) = 1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere d\u03a92 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 is the metric on the unit 2-sphere. We also assume\nr\u0302\u2192\u221e\n\nr\u0302\u2192\u221e\n\nfor ensuring that the metric is asymptotically flat. Ref. [7] has shown that the low-energy\nabsorption cross section for minimally coupled fermions is given by the area measured in\nthe flat spatial metric conformally related to the true metric in the form\n\u03c3 = 2gh\u22121A,\n\n(3)\n\n\u221a\nwhere A \u2261 4\u03c0Rh2 is the horizon area, Rh = r\u0302h gh , gh = g(r\u0302h ), and r\u0302h is a horizon radius\nusually determined by the largest solution of f (r\u0302) = 0, the factor 2 comes from the number\nof spinors.\nAs a fundamental but very important case of (1), the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m (RN) black\nhole has the metric form\nds2RN = F (r)dt2 \u2212 F (r)\u22121 dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03a92 .\n\n(4)\n\nwith\n\u0013\n2M\nQ2\nF (r) = 1 \u2212\n+ 2 .\nr\nr\nThere are two horizons, the event horizon r+ and Cauchy horizon r\u2212 ,\np\nr\u00b1 = M \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 Q2 .\n\u0012\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nThe extremal RN black hole corresponds to the case r+ = r\u2212 or, equivalently, M = Q. The\nmetric (4) can also be written in the form [8]\nds2RN = fRN (r\u0302)dt2 \u2212 gRN (r\u0302) dr\u0302 2 + r\u0302 2 d\u03a92\n3\n\n\u0001\n\n(7)\n\n\fwith\n\u00152\nr\u0302 2 \u2212 C 2\nfRN (r\u0302) =\n,\n(r\u0302 + C)2 + r\u0302r\u2212\n\u0014\n\u00152\n(r\u0302 + C)2 r\u2212\ngRN (r\u0302) =\n,\n+\nr\u0302 2\nr\u0302\n\u0014\n\n(8)\n\nwhere C = (r+ \u2212 r\u2212 )/4, and the relation between r and r\u0302 is\nr=\n\n(r\u0302 + C)2\n+ r\u2212 .\nr\u0302\n\n(9)\n\nUsing the GBC theorem and the boundary conditions, it is shown that the Euler characteristic\n\u03c7=2\n\n(10)\n\nfor the nonextremal RN black hole [10, 11, 12] and\n\u03c7=0\n\n(11)\n\nfor the extremal RN black hole [13, 14]. In the later sections, we will prove that the above\ntwo formulas are held for general spherically symmetric black holes as well as for the Kerr\nand Kerr\u2013Newman black holes.\nIt is interesting to note that the low-energy absorption cross section \u03c3 for the Dirac\nfermion always vanishes in the extremal limit regardless of the detailed geometry of the\nspacetime [7, 8]. So we introduce the relation between the absorption cross section and the\ntopology of spherically symmetric black holes\n\u03c3 = gh\u22121 A \u03c7.\n\n(12)\n\nThus, the topologies (10) and (11) of spherically symmetric black holes lead directly to the\nnonzero and zero results of the absorption cross section by taking account of the relation\n(12).\n\nIII.\n\nTHE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION DENSITY IN SPHERICALLY SYM-\n\nMETRIC BLACK HOLES\n\nThe topologies (10) and (11) give the global structure of spherically symmetric black\nholes. In this section, in order to show the relation between the absorption cross section and\n4\n\n\fthe topology of spherically symmetric black holes, let us consider the Euler characteristic\nin detail and introduce the absorption cross section density of spherically symmetric black\nholes.\nFor a closed N(even)-dimensional Riemannian manifold M N , the Euler characteristic\n\u03c7(M N ) can be expressed as the volume integral of the GBC differential N-form \u039b:\nZ\nN\n\u03c7(M ) =\n\u039b,\n\n(13)\n\nMN\n\n\u039b=\n\n(\u22121)N/2\u22121\n\u0001 \u03b5A1 A2 ***AN\u22121 AN F A1 A2 \u2227 * * * \u2227 F AN\u22121 AN ,\nN\nN\nN/2\n2 \u03c0\n!\n2\n\n(14)\n\nin which F AB is the curvature tensor of SO(N) principal bundle of the Riemannian manifold\nM, i.e., the SO(N) gauge field 2-form\nF AB = d\u03c9 AB \u2212 \u03c9 AC \u2227 \u03c9 CB ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c9 AB is the spin connection 1-form. Chern has shown that the GBC N-form \u039b on M N\ncan be pulled back to S(M N ) as the exterior derivative of a differential (N \u2212 1)-form \u03a9:\n\u03c0 \u2217 \u039b = d\u03a9,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c0 \u2217 denotes the pullback of the projection \u03c0 : S(M N ) \u2192 M N .

This result shows that the topology of\nthe absorption cross section is determined by the zeros of \u03c6(x), i.e. the singularities of n(x)\nwhich coincides with the timelike Killing vector field of the spherically symmetric spacetime.\nTherefore, it is essential to investigate the solutions of \u03c6(x) = 0.\n7\n\n\fSuppose that the vector field \u03c6(x) has l zero points which are denoted as ~zi (i = 1, * * * , l).\nAccording to the implicit function theorem [18], when the zero points ~zi are the regular\npoints of \u03c6(x), i.e. when the Jacobian determinant\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c6\n\u2202(\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 , \u03c64)\nJ\n=\nx ~zi\n\u2202(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )\n\n~\nzi\n\n6= 0,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere J (\u03c6/x) = J 0 (\u03c6/x) is the usual Jacobian determinant, there exists one and only one\ncontinuous solution of \u03c6a (x) = 0. The solution can be expressed as ~zi = ~zi (t), which is the\ntrajectory of the ith zero point of \u03c6(x). According to the \u03b4-function theory [19] and the\n\u03c6-mapping theory, we know that \u03b4(\u03c6) can be expanded by these zeros as\n\u03b4(\u03c6) =\n\nl\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b2i\n\u03b4(~x \u2212 ~zi ),\n|J(\u03c6/x)|~zi\n\n(37)\n\nwhere the positive integer \u03b2i is called the Hopf index of the \u03c6-mapping at ~zi and it means\nthat, when the point ~x covers the neighborhood of ~zi once, the function \u03c6(x) covers the\ncorresponding region \u03b2i times, which is a topological number of first Chern class and relates\nto the generalized winding number of the \u03c6-mapping. Substituting (37) into (35), the\nabsorption cross section density \u03c1 is formulated by\n\u03c1=\n\nl\nA X\n\u03b2i \u03b7i \u03b4(~x \u2212 ~zi ),\ngh i=1\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03b7i is called the Brouwer degree of the \u03c6-mapping at ~zi [9, 20] and\n\u03b7i = signJ(\u03c6/x)|~zi = \u00b11\n\n(39)\n\naccording to the clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation of \u03c6(x) when ~x circles ~zi clockwise.

The topology (42) gives the global property of the Schwarzschild black\nhole. In the following, let us compute the value of the Hopf index for the Schwarzschild\nblack hole.\nBy using the Killing equation\n(\u2202\u03bb g\u03bc\u03bd )\u03c6\u03bb + g\u03bb\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c6\u03bb + g\u03bb\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u03bb = 0,\n\n(43)\n\nand the static and spherically symmetric properties of the Schwarzschild black hole that\nimply\n\u22020 \u03c6\u03bc = \u22023 \u03c6\u03bc ,\n\n\u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3,\n\n(44)\n\none can solve the Killing vector field \u03c6\u03bc (x) and, by transforming into the local orthonormal\nvierbein index \"a\": \u03c6a = ea\u03bc \u03c6\u03bc (x), one obtains\nr\n2M\n, \u03c61 = \u03c62 = 0,\n\u03c60 = 1 \u2212\nr\n\n\u03c63 = r sin \u03b8.\n\n(45)\n\nIt is easy to see that for the Schwarzschild black hole the Killing vector field \u03c6a has two\nzeros located at\n(r = 2M, \u03b8 = 0),\n9\n\n(r = 2M, \u03b8 = \u03c0).\n\n(46)\n\n\fOne can see the distribution of Killing vector field in the figures in Ref.

Now let us compute the value of the Hopf index for general spherically symmetric\nblack holes.\nIn this general case, the metric can be taken the form given in Eq. (1).

The Kerr solution describes both the stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat gravitational field outside a\nmassive rotating body and a rotating black hole with mass M and angular momentum J.\nThe Kerr black hole can also be viewed as the final state of a collapsing star, uniquely\ndetermined by its mass and rate of rotation. Moreover, its thermodynamical behavior is\nvery different from the Schwarzschild black hole or the RN black hole, because of its much\nmore complicated causal structure. Hence its study is of great interest in understanding\nphysical properties of astrophysical objects, as well as in checking any conjecture about\nthermodynamical properties of black holes.\nIn terms of Boyer\u2013Lindquist coordinates, the Euclidean Kerr metric reads [23]\nds2 =\n\n\u00012 \u033a2 2\n\u2206\n2\ndt\n\u2212\nasin\n\u03b8d\u03c6\n+ dr\n\u033a2\n\u2206\ni2\n2 h\n\u0001\nsin \u03b8\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+\u033a d\u03b8 + 2\nr + a d\u03c6 \u2212 adt ,\n\u033a\n\n(69)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the Kerr horizon function\n\n\u2206 = r 2 \u2212 2Mr + a2 ,\n\n(70)\n\n\u033a = r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8.\n\n(71)\n\nand\n\nHere a is the angular momentum for unit mass as measured from the infinity; it vanishes in\nthe Schwarzschild limit.

Using the GBC theorem, it has been\nproved [24, 25] that \u03c7 = 2 for the nonextremal Kerr black hole and \u03c7 = 0 for the extremal\none.\nSuch a metric (69) corresponds to the following vierbein 1-forms:\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u033a\n\u2206\ndt \u2212 a sin2 \u03b8d\u03c6 , e1 = \u221a dr,\ne0 =\n\u033a\n\u2206\nh\ni\n\u0001\nsin \u03b8\n2\n2\n2\n3\nr + a d\u03c6 \u2212 adt ,\ne = \u033ad\u03b8, e =\n\u033a\n13\n\n(73)\n(74)\n\n\fwhere \u033a is the positive square root of \u033a2 . The Killing equation and the condition for the\nKilling vector field \u03c6\u03bc are same as Eqs. (43) and (44). By the relation \u03c6a = ea\u03bc \u03c6\u03bc and the\nvierbein given in (73) and (74), the solution for \u03c6a is read as\ns\na sin \u03b8\n\u2206\n, \u03c61 = \u03c62 = 0, \u03c63 = \u221a .\n\u03c60 =\n\u033a\n\u033a\n\n(75)\n\nFor the nonextremal Kerr black hole, the Killing vector field \u03c6a (75) has four zeros (ri , \u03b8i )\nlocated at\n(r+ , 0),\n\n(r+ , \u03c0),\n\n(r\u2212 , 0),\n\n(r\u2212 , \u03c0).\n\n(76)\n\nThe Hopf indexes and the Brouwer degrees (\u03b2i , \u03b7i ) correspond to these zeros are\n(1, +1), (1, +1), (1, \u22121), (1, \u22121).\n\n(77)\n\nAgain, it is only the zeros (r+ , 0) and (r+ , \u03c0) that have contribution to the Euler characteristic \u03c7 which is calculated to be\n\u03c7 = 2.\n\n(78)\n\nFor the extremal Kerr black hole, the Killing vector field \u03c6a has two zeros located at\n(r+ , 0) and (r+ , \u03c0), and the corresponding Hopf indices are \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 0, which gives the\nEuler characteristic\n\u03c7 = 0.\n\n(79)\n\nLastly, let us give a comment on a more general spacetime\u2013the Kerr\u2013Newman black hole,\nwhich metric has Petrov type D and has also the form of the Kerr black hole (69) but with\n\u2206 = r 2 \u2212 2Mr + a2 + Q2 . From the formalized solution of the Killing vector field for the\nKerr black hole (75), one can conclude that the results (78) and (79) are also held for the\nKerr\u2013Newman black hole. we will assume that the result (3) generalizes to arbitrary charged\nrotating black holes and so the relations (67) and (68) continues to hold for the Kerr black\nhole and the Kerr\u2013Newman black hole.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we first present a relation between the low-energy absorption cross section\nfor minimally coupled fermions and the Euler characteristic of (3+1)-dimensional spherically\nsymmetric black holes. From the relation, one can see clearly that the topologies (10) and\n14\n\n\f(11) of spherically symmetric black holes, which correspond to the nonextremal and extremal\nblack holes, respectively, lead directly to the nonzero and zero results of the absorption cross\nsection. Then using the relation and the GBC theorem, we introduce the absorption cross\nsection density to describe the relation between them. It is shown that the absorption cross\nsection and its density are determined by the singularities of the timelike Killing vector field\nof spacetime and these singularities are labeled by the topological numbers, Hopf indices\nand Brouwer degrees. For nonextremal black holes, there are two singularities with the Hopf\nindices \u03b2 = 1 and Brouwer degrees \u03b7 = +1 on the north pole and south pole of event horizon\nand two singularities with \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b7 = \u22121 on the north pole and south pole of Cauchy\nhorizon. In this case, only the singularities on event horizon have contribution to the Euler\ncharacteristic and the absorption cross section and one obtains \u03c7 = 2 and \u03c3 = 2gh\u22121 A. For\nextremal ones, there are only two singularities with \u03b2 = 0 on the north pole and south pole\nof horizon. In this case, the singularities have no contribution to the Euler characteristic\nand the absorption cross section and then \u03c7 = 0 and \u03c3 = 0. The results (38) and (40) give\ninformation of quantization through the singularities and the topological numbers, which\ncan be looked upon as the topological quantization of the absorption cross section.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank Prof. Guohong Yang for interesting discussions.
