The capacity of a channel depends on different\nfactors, like the type of information that one wants to\ntransmit, the character of the physical material that realizes the transfer, the constraints that exist on the channel, the assistance that is available for the information\ntransfer, etc.\nThe capacity of a channel for the transmission of classical information by using quantum states is an important\nexample, which has attracted a lot of interest recently. In\nthis respect, a fundamental result, obtained more than 30\nyears ago, is the \"Holevo bound\" [3, 4] (see also [5, 6, 7]).\nAn essential message conveyed by the Holevo bound is\nthat at most n bits (binary digits) of classical information\ncan be carried by a quantum system of n distinguishable\nqubits (two-dimensional quantum systems). However, the\nHolevo bound includes arbitrary encoding and decoding\nstrategies. This has the consequence that for information\ntransmission with infinite dimensional systems through\nnoiseless channels, e.g. with the modes of an electromagnetic field, the Holevo bound predicts infinite capacities.\nA similar situation appears also for the capacity of\ntransmitting quantum information, merely by definition.\nTo avoid such nonphysical values, it is important to\nintroduce the relevant physical constraints, while maximizing over the classical or quantum information that\ncan be encoded in a physical system. Classical capacities\nof channels that carry photons in the form of modes of\n\nan electromagnetic field have been studied extensively in\nthe last decade [5, 8, 9]. In this case, as well as for the\nquantum capacity, as considered in this paper, the natural choice is an energy constraint on the input states of\nthe channel.\nIn this paper, we will deal with channels carrying particles that have a non-vanishing mass. Such a problem\nis motivated by recent experiments producing atomic\nwaveguides in optical microstructures [10], or in atom\nchips [11]. These experiments indicate a new possibility\nof using massive particles in quantum channels for classical as well as quantum communication over macroscopic,\nor at least mesoscopic distances. For such massive particles, it is natural to put an average particle number\nconstraint along with an average energy constraint on\nthe input state of the channel. We will show that with\nthese constraints, the grand canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics attains the classical as well as quantum\ncapacity of noiseless channels that carry trapped noninteracting massive particles. Moreover, we show that the\nclassical and quantum capacities in the case of noiseless\nquantum channels (with the above physical constraints)\nare the same. Therefore in the remainder of this paper, the phrase \"capacity of (quantum) channels carrying massive particles\" (usually implicitly implying that\nthe constraints on energy and particle numbers are already taken into account), unless with the specific adjective, will mean the classical as well the quantum capacity. We should mention here that sometimes, it is more\nnatural to consider the average energy constraint with a\nfixed number of particles. In this case, the capacity is\nattained in the canonical ensemble. Calculations of different properties of the canonical ensemble are usually\n\n\f2\nvery hard, as compared to the grand canonical ensemble.\nHowever, several studies indicate that the two ensembles\ngive similar values for the average occupation numbers\neven for finite, but moderately large number of particles\n[12]. However, there are physical quantities of interest\nthat give drastically different values. For example, the\nfluctuation in the average number of particles in a Bose\nEinstein condensate is unphysically large according to the\ngrand canonical ensemble, while that in the canonical ensemble is physically meaningful [12]. In this paper, we\nwill restrict ourselves to the grand canonical ensembles,\nfor finding the capacities of channels carrying massive\nparticles. The capacities, being dependent only on the\naverage occupation numbers, will be similar already for\na moderately large number of particles.\nNoninteracting bosons exhibit a critical phenomenon,\nthe Bose Einstein condensation (BEC). In this paper, we\nwill show that the capacity of channels carrying noninteracting bosons also exhibit this criticality with temperature. The capacity changes its behavior from being concave to convex (with respect to temperature), at the critical temperature. Noninteracting fermions do not show\nany critical behavior. However, interacting fermions can\nexhibit the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) transition.\nAs we have shown in Ref. [13], the channel capacity in\nthis case also indicates the BCS transition. It should\nbe noted here that the convexity and concavity, that we\nspeak about in this paper, are always with respect to\ntemperature, and not with respect to mixing of states.\nAn important motivation of this study is to compare\nthe capacities of channels carrying bosons with that of\nfermions. We will obtain the following result analytically:\nCapacities of noiseless quantum channels carrying noninteracting spinless fermions are higher than that of spinless bosons for a wide range of power law potentials for\nsufficienly high temperatures.\nSince we obtain the above result by using perturbation\ntheory up to the third order, it holds already for moderate temperatures. Note that our numerical simulations\nindicate that fermions are better carriers of information\nthan bosons even in the low temerature region.\nIt may be noted that although the quantum channel\nthat we consider in the paper is noiseless, the states that\nare used to encode the information are allowed to be noisy\n(mixed states encoding). In the case of classical capacity,\nit will turn out that there exist ensembles of pure states,\nwhich can be used to encode the classical information (to\nbe transferred), for attaining the maximal information\ntransfer.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we discuss\nthe Holevo bound on classical information transmission.\nWe define the classical capacity of quantum channels in\nthe next section (Sec. III). In Sec. IV, we define quantum capacity of quantum channels. In Sec. V, we discuss\nthe important ensembles in statistical mechanics, and in\nits first three subsections, we discuss respectively the microcanonical, the canonical, and the grand canonical en-\n\nsembles. In Sec. V D, we consider the situation when\nthere is a constraint on the average number of particles,\nwhile there is no constraint on the (exact or average)\nnumber of particles. In the next section (Sec. VI), we discuss the capacities of quantum channels with constrained\ninputs. We then briefly discuss the capacities of channels\ncarrying photons in Sec. VII. In Sec. VIII, we consider spinless noninteracting bosons and fermions, and\ncalculate the capacity of channels in these cases. In Sec.\nIX, we prove a theorem stating that fermions can carry\nmore information (classical and quantum) than bosons.\nIn Sec. X, we consider the low temperature case, for the\n3D box and the 3D harmonic trap. For both these cases,\nthe fermionic capacity is again higher than the bosonic\none for sufficiently low temperatures. In the last section\n(Sec. XI), we make some concluding remarks. This paper presents on one hand the results of Ref. [13] with\nmore details, and on the other hand generalizes them to\nthe case of trapped non-interacting bosonic and fermionic\ngases for a large class of power law potentials. Let us note\nthat many of such potentials are feasible with currently\navailable technology. We will see that the signature of\nBEC in the channel capacity in the case of a harmonic\ntrap, is more pronounced than that in the case of a uniform trap, as considered in Ref. [13].\nIt may be worthwhile to mention here that the mathematics required for obtaining the capacities, is similar to\nthat in quantum statistical mechanics, where one maximizes the entropy under different constraints. This is not\nvery surprising, as the bounds on information transfer,\ndiscussed in Secs. II and IV, are \"entropy-like\" quantities.\nII.\n\nTHE HOLEVO BOUND\n\nThe Holevo bound is an upper bound on the amount of\nclassical information that can be accessed from a quantum ensemble in which the information is encoded. Suppose therefore that a sender Alice (A) obtains the classical message i, and she knows that this happens with\nprobability pi . She wants to send it to a receiver Bob (B).\nTo do so, Alice encodes the information i in a quantum\nstate \u03c1i , and sends the quantum state to Bob. Bob receives the ensemble {pi , \u03c1i }, and wants to obtain as much\ninformation as possible about i, for which he performs\na measurement, that gives the result m, with probability qm . Let the corresponding post-measurement ensemble be {pi|m , \u03c1i|m }. The classical information gathered\ncan be quantified by the mutual information between the\nmessage index i and the measurement outcome [1]:\nX\nI(i : m) = H({pi }) \u2212\nqm H({pi|m }).\n(1)\nm\n\nP\n\nHere H({rx }) = \u2212 x rx log2 rx is the Shannon entropy\nof the probability distribution {rx }. Throughout the paper, we calculate the all the quantities on amounts of\ninformation transfer in bits (binary digits). Note that\n\n\f3\nthe mutual information can be seen as the difference between the initial disorder and the (average) final disorder.\nBob will be interested to obtain the maximal information,\nwhich is the maximum of I(i : m) over all measurement\nstrategies. This quantity is called the accessible information:\nIacc = max I(i : m),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the maximization is over all measurement strategies.\nThe maximization involved in the definition of accessible information is usually hard to compute, and hence it\nis important to know bounds on Iacc [3, 4, 14]. In particular, in Ref. [3, 4], a universal upper bound, called the\nHolevo bound (or Holevo quantity), on Iacc is given (see\nalso [5, 6, 7]):\nX\nIacc ({pi , \u03c1i }) \u2264 \u03c7({pi , \u03c1i }) \u2261 S(\u03c1) \u2212\npi S(\u03c1i ). (3)\ni\n\nHere \u03c1 =\n\nP\n\ni pi \u03c1i is the average ensemble state, and\n\nS(\u03c2) = \u2212tr(\u03c2 log2 \u03c2)\n\n(4)\n\nis the von Neumann entropy of \u03c2.\nIII.\n\nCLASSICAL CAPACITY OF A QUANTUM\nCHANNEL: UNCONSTRAINED INPUTS\n\nConsider a quantum channel R that acts on ddimensional quantum systems as inputs. Suppose that\nAlice wants to send some classical information i, that\noccurs with probability pi , through this quantum channel to Bob. She encodes this classical information in the\nquantum state \u03c1i , where the Hilbert space corresponding\nto the quantum states \u03c1i is d-dimensional. The classical\ncapacity of this quantum channel is the maximal classical information that can be sent through this channel,\nand is therefore the accessible information of the ensemble {pi , R(\u03c1i )}, maximized over all such ensembles on the\nd-dimensional Hilbert space Hd :\nC=\n\nmax\n\n{pi ,\u03c1i } on Hd\n\nIacc ({pi , R(\u03c1i )}).\n\n(5)\n\nHowever, capacities are usually defined in an asymptotic\nsense.

This value is attained\nby any complete orthogonal basis of pure states on Hd .\nNow for infinite dimensional quantum systems, the\nchannel capacity obtained in this way predicts an unphysical infinite capacity. This is because the Holevo\nbound itself does not include any constraint on the available physical resources in an actual implementation of\nthe information transfer. In particular, arbitrary encoding and decoding schemes are allowed. To avoid this infinite capacity, one usually maximizes the accessible information over all ensembles that satisfies certain physical\nconstraints. Due to the form of the Holevo bound on\naccessible information, such constrained maximizations\nare very similar to the ones in statistical mechanics. The\nsame is true for the case of the quantum capacity which\nwe briefly discuss in the succeeding section, and then in\nSec. V, we briefly discuss some similar constrained maximizations of statistical mechanics.\n\nIV.\n\nQUANTUM CAPACITY OF A QUANTUM\nCHANNEL: UNCONSTRAINED INPUTS\n\nWe now consider the case of sending qubits (as opposed\nto bits) using quantum channels. The quantum capacity\ncan be considered in (at least) the following four different situations [17]: the quantum channel R (acting on d\ndimensional quantum states at its input)\n\u2022 without the help of additional classical communication (in this case, we call the quantum capacity\nQ0 ),\n\u2022 with an arbitrary amount of forward classical communication (Q\u2192 ),\n\u2022 with an arbitrary amount of backward classical\ncommunication (Q\u2190 ),\n\u2022 with an arbitrary amount of both-way classical\ncommunication (Q\u2194 ).\n\n#\n\npi S(R(\u03c1i )) .\n(8)\n\nLet us define the first case, the other definitions being\nsimilar. So, the quantum capacity Q0 is [18]\nlog2 D(n)\n,\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\n\nQ0 = sup lim\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nwhere the supremum is over all such cases when there exists a D(n) dimensional subspace S(n), of the total input\nspace (Hd )\u2297n , satisfying the average fidelity criterion\nZ\nh\u03c8|R\u2297n (|\u03c8ih\u03c8|)|\u03c8id|\u03c8i = 1,\n(11)\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03a9(E,N )\n\nand the ensemble {1/\u03a9(E, N ), |E, N, ki}k=1\nthe microcanonical ensemble.\nB.\n\nis called\n\nThe canonical ensemble\n\n|\u03c8i\u2208S(n)\n\nwhere no classical communication was used in transferring the input state from the sender to the receiver.\nIn case of a noiseless channel, the fidelity criterion is\nautomatically satisfied, and all the quantum capacities\nare equal to log2 d. Now, if the dimension d of the input\nspace is infinite, the capacities are again infinite, as in\nthe case of classical capacity.\nThere are several remarkable results that are known\nin the noisy case. In particular, Q0 is the maximum\ncoherent information [18, 19, 20, 21]:\nQ0 = max [S(R(\u03c1)) \u2212 S(I \u2297 R(\u03a6\u03c1 ))] ,\n\u03c1\n\nConsider next a physical system, described by the\nHamiltonian H, which has a fixed particle number N and\na fixed average energy E. The average energy constraint\nforces every state \u033a to follow\ntr(H\u033a) = E.\n\n(15)\n\nThis physical system represents a closed, but not isolated\nsystem. We again want to find the state \u033aC of the system\nsuch that it maximizes the von Neumann entropy S. One\nfinds that [24]\n\n(12)\n\n1\nexp(\u2212\u03b2H),\nZC\n\n\u033aC =\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the maximization is over all quantum states \u03c1 defined on the Hilbert space Hd , \u03a6\u03c1 is a purification of \u03c1,\nand I is the identity operator acting on quantum states\nof the ancillary Hilbert space that is required for the purification. Furthermore [22, 23],\n\nthe canonical state of the system. Here \u03b2 = kB1T , with kB\nbeing the Boltzmann constant, and T the absolute temperature. The canonical partition function ZC is given\nby\n\nQ0 = Q\u2192 .\n\nZC = tr (exp(\u2212\u03b2H)) .\n\nV.\n\n(13)\n\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL ENSEMBLES IN\nSTATISTICAL MECHANICS\n\nIn this section, we discuss the fundamental ensembles\nin statistical mechanics (see e.g. [24, 25, 26]).\nA.\n\nThe microcanonical ensemble\n\nSuppose that we have a physical system described by\nthe Hamiltonian H. We assume that the system has a\nfixed particle number N , and a fixed energy E. (To be\nmore general, one must allow for fluctuations around E\nand N .) This represents a closed and isolated system.\nWe want to find the state \u033aMC of the system such that\nit maximizes the von Neumann entropy S. Let |E, N, ki\ndenote the state a energy E and particle number N , and\nwhere k enumerates the degeneracy. Let \u03a9(E, N ) be the\ntotal number of orthogonal states with energy E and particle number N , so that k = 1, 2, . . . , \u03a9(E, N ). Since the\nsystem is isolated (as it has fixed energy and fixed number\n\u03a9(E,N )\nof particles), the set {|E, N, ki}k=1\nspans the allowed\nHilbert space. Consequently, the maximum entropy is\nreached by the state\n\nThe state \u033aC is called the canonical state of the system and the ensemble { Z1C exp(\u2212\u03b2\u01ebi ), |\u01ebi i} is called the\ncanonical ensemble, where {\u01ebi , |\u01ebi i} is the eigensystem of\nthe Hamiltonian H. Just like for the microcanonical ensemble, the particle number enters the calculations via\nthe Hamiltonian and for determining the allowed Hilbert\nspace. For example, in the calculation of the trace in\nEq. (17), the summation runs over all combinations of\ndifferent numbers of particles at different energy levels,\nunder the constraint that the sum of all particles in all\nthe levels is N . Moreover, for indistinguishable particles,\nwe must also take care about the statistics of the particles. For example, if we have a trap, whose energy levels\nare \u01ebi , and in which N noninteracting spinless bosons are\ntrapped, so that the bosons are described by the HamilP\ntonian Hb = i \u01ebi a\u2020i ai (where a\u2020i and ai are creation and\ndestruction operators of the ith mode), we have\n!\nX\nX\nX\nb\nZC =\n. . . exp \u2212\u03b2\n\u01eb i ni\nn0 =0,1,...\n\n|\n\n=\n\nn1 =0,1,...\n\nP\n\ni\n\nX\n\n\u033aMC\n\n(14)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich is actually the identity on the allowed Hilbert\nspace.

For\na given value of energy E, the temperature T is given by\n\u2202\nE = \u2212 \u2202\u03b2\n(loge ZC ).\n\n\f5\nC.\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble\n\nThe next step is to consider a physical system, described by the Hamiltonian H, which has a fixed average\nparticle number N and a fixed average energy E. The\naverage energy constraint forces every state \u033a to follow\nEq. (15), while the average particle number constraint\nreads\ntr(N \u033a) = N,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere N represents the total particle number operator. For example, for a system of spinless bosons, N =\nP \u2020\n\u2020\ni ai ai , where ai and ai are the creation and annihilation operators of the ith mode. This physical system\nrepresents an open system. We again want to find the\nstate \u033aGC of the system such that it maximizes the von\nNeumann entropy S. One finds that the state is [24]\n\u033aGC =\n\n1\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b2(H \u2212 \u03bcN )),\n\nZGC\n\n(21)\n\nZGC = tr (exp(\u2212\u03b2(H \u2212 \u03bcN ))) .\n\n(22)\n\nNote that in this case, the number of particles is not\nfixed, and in particular,\n!\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\u0001\nb\n\u01ebi \u2212 \u03bcb nbi\n. . . exp \u2212\u03b2\nZGC\n=\ni\n\nnb0 =0 nb1 =0\n\n=\n\ni\n\n1\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2(\u01ebi \u2212\u03bcb )\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nin the case of noninteracting spinless bosons in a trap of\nenergy levels {\u01ebi }, and where we have now denoted the\nchemical potential by \u03bcb .

We can determine the\nchemical potential from the constraint on the average\nparticle number constraint, for given values of the temperature and average particle number. We can then find\nthe grand partition function with these values. The average occupation numbers, in the case of noninteracting\nspinless bosons, are given by\nnbi =\n\nD.\n\nThe constraint on the number of particles\n\nOne may now consider the case, when we do not have a\nconstraint on the number of particles. In other words, arbitrary numbers of particles are allowed. For the energy,\nwe still assume that the average energy is fixed to E.

Otherwise,\nfor given values of the average energy and average particle number, the dual constraints on average energy and\nparticle number can be simultaneously solved to obtain\nthe chemical potential, and the temperature.\n\n1\ne\u03b2(\u01ebi \u2212\u03bcb )\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nfor noninteracting bosons in a trap of energy levels {\u01ebi }.\nNote that this partition function is different from the\ncanonical partition function in that there is noP\nconstraint\non the number of particles (i.e. the constraint i ni = N\ndoes not exist anymore), and from the grand canonical\npartition function in that the term \u03b2\u03bcN is absent inside\nthe exponent.\nIn the case when the lowest energy level is zero or negative, at least one of the sums in Eq. (27) is divergent.\nSuch divergence\ndoes not occur in ZC , due to the conP\nstraint i ni = N . Neither does it occur in ZGC , as the\nterm \u03b2\u03bcN in the exponent \"cures\" the divergence.\nIf the lowest energy level is positive, we have\nZb =\n\nY\ni\n\n1\n,\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u01ebi\n\n(28)\n\nand the average occupation number of the ith level is\nni = \u2212\n\n\u2202\n1\n,\nloge Z b = \u03b2\u01ebi\n\u2202(\u03b2\u01ebi )\ne \u22121\n\n(29)\n\nso that the total average number of particles is\nN=\n\nX\ni\n\nni =\n\nX\ni\n\n1\n,\ne\u03b2\u01ebi \u2212 1\n\nwhile the total average energy is\nX\n\u01ebi\n.\nni \u01ebi = \u03b2\u01ebi\ne \u22121\ni\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\nSince all the energy levels are positive, these sums are\nconvergent, and so we are not able to approach the \"thermodynamic limit\" (N \u2192 \u221e). The thermodynamic limit,\ni.e. the limiting case of an infinite number of particles\ncan be reached only in the trivial case when T \u2192 \u221e.\n\n\f6\nThis for example is the case for photons, in the form\nof modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed (finite)\ncavity, in which case the zero frequency mode is not populated. With increasing cavity size, one may approach\nas close as possible to the zero frequency mode, but then\nthe density matrix describing the system ceases, in the\nlimit, to be trace-class.\nThis problem does not arise in case of the canonical\nstate, as in that case, if the lowest energy level is nonzero\n(positive or negative), we can define \u01eb0i = \u01ebi \u2212 \u01eb0 (\u01eb0 is the\nlowest energy level), so that we can rewrite the canonical\npartition function as\nZCb = exp(\u2212\u03b2\u01eb0 N ) \u00d7\nX\nX\nn0 =0,1,...\n\n|\n\nexp \u2212\u03b2\n\n...\n\nn1 =0,1,...\n\nP\n\ni\n\n{z\n\nni =N\n\n= exp(\u2212\u03b2\u01eb0 N )ZCb 0 ,\n\nX\ni\n\n}\n\n\u01eb i ni\n\n!\n(32)\n\nwhere ZCb 0 is the canonical partition function of a system\nof N noninteracting bosons in a trap with energy levels\n{\u01eb0i }, and with the lowest energy level vanishing. The\nfactor exp(\u2212\u03b2\u01eb0 N ) in Eq. (32) is a constant for given\nparticle number and energy. For the case of the grand\ncanonical state, if the lowest energy is nonzero, we again\nrewrite the grand canonical partition function as\n\u221e\nYX\n\nb\nZGC\n=\n\nb\n,\nZGC\n0\n\n(33)\n\nb\nwhere ZGC\nis the grand canonical partition function of a\n0\nsystem of N noninteracting bosons in a trap with energy\nlevels {\u01eb0i }, and with the lowest energy level vanishing,\nand with a correspondingly changed chemical potential\n\u03bcb0 .\nThe discussion in this subsection so far concerned the\ncase of noninteracting bosons. In the case of noninteracting fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle forces the\nni 's in Eq. (27) to run from 0 to 1, so that the partition function in this case is (we consider \"spinless\" i.e.\npolarized fermions)\n\nZf =\n\n1\nYX\n\n=\n\nWe now consider the case of quantum channels with\nconstrained inputs. The motivation for such consideration is the fact that in the noiseless case, the capacities\n(both classical and quantum) are in some cases infinite,\nand thus calls for putting some realistic constraints on\nthe set-up.\nSurely, the constraints will depend on the specific realization of the physical system under consideration. In\nanticipation of the cases that we will consider below, we\nput constraints on the average energy and the average\nnumber of particles of the input states. Suppose therefore\nthat we have a system of particles that are sent through\na channel R, and that is governed by the Hamiltonian\nH. Let the corresponding total particle number operator\nbe N. We only allow those inputs, \u03c1, to the channel that\nsatisfies the following two constraints:\n\n(1 + exp(\u2212\u03b2\u01ebi )) .\n\n(34)\n\nThe average occupation numbers in this case are (we are\nusing the same notation for bosons and fermions)\n\u2202\n1\n,\nloge Z f = \u03b2\u01ebi\n\u2202(\u03b2\u01ebi )\ne +1\n\ntr(H\u03c1) = E,\n\n(36)\n\ntr(N\u03c1) = N,\n\n(37)\n\nand\n\nfor certain chosen values of E and N .\nConsequently, the classical capacities C and C \u221e , are\nnow respectively the same as the right-hand-sides of\nEqs. (5) and (6), but where the maximizations are over\nthose ensembles whose average ensemble states satisfy\nthe above constraints. For the case of C, the input ensembles must satisfy exactly the constraints in Eqs. (36)\nand (36). For the case of C \u221e , the constraints must be\nsuitably modified. In this case, they are (cf. Ref. [27])\n!\nn\nX\nHi \u03c1 = nE,\n(38)\ntr\ni=1\n\nand\nn\nX\ni=1\n\ni\n\nni = \u2212\n\nCAPACITIES OF QUANTUM CHANNELS\nWITH CONSTRAINED INPUTS\n\ntr\n\nexp (\u2212\u03b2\u01ebi ni )\n\ni ni =0\n\nY\n\nVI.\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b2(\u01eb0i \u2212 \u03bcb0 )ni )\n\ni ni =0\n\n=\n\nof the value of the lowest energy level.

N . . . \u2297 I.\nIt seems plausible that (cf. Eq. (9))\n\"\n#\nX\n\u221e,1\nC\n= max S(R(\u03c1)) \u2212\npi S(R(\u03c1i )) ,\n(40)\ni\n\nwhere the maximization is over all ensembles {pi , \u03c1i } such\nthat the average ensemble state \u03c1 satisfies Eqs. (36) and\n\n\f7\n(37). The case of a noiseless channel with constrained\ninputs was considered in Ref. [27]. (Note that we are using the same notations for the capacities as those in the\nunconstrained case.) In the succeeding sections, we will\nconsider the right-hand-side of Eq. (40) to be the \"classical capacity\" of the noiseless quantum channel where\nthe inputs are constrained by either or both the energy\nand number constraints.\nSimilarly, it seems to be true that the quantum capacities (without, or with forward, classical communication)\nof a quantum channel with inputs constrained by Eqs.\n(5) and (6), are given by the Eqs. (12) and (13) respectively, but where the maximization in the right-hand-side\nof Eq. (12) is over those inputs that satisfies Eqs. (5)\nand (6). It is indeed true in the noiseless channel case, as\nwe will show in Sec. VIII A. (Actually, in the noiseless\ncase, all the quantum capacities defined in Sec. IV are\nequal.)\nVII.\n\nCOMMUNICATION CHANNELS THAT\nCARRY PHOTONS\n\nAs we have already discussed in Secs. III and IV,\nthe classical and quantum capacities of a noiseless quantum channel that are constrained only by the dimension\nof the transferred state, predict infinite capacities. To\navoid such infinite capacities, in the case of communication channels that carry photons, one usually applies the\nenergy constraint on the allowed states (or ensembles)\nthat are fed into the quantum channel [5, 8, 9]. Suppose\ntherefore that we have a system of photons that is being\nsent through a channel, and is described by the HamilP\ntonian Hp = i ~\u03c9i a\u2020i ai . Here, we consider the case of\nclassical capacity. From the considerations for massive\nbosons considered in Sec. VIII A, it will be apparent that\nall the quantum capacties defined in Sec. IV are equal to\nthe classical capacity, in this case of photons also.\nThe energy constraint implies that for any ensemble\n{pi , \u03c1i } used in a classical information transfer must satisfy\ntr (Hp \u03c1) = E,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere E is a pre-assigned P\nvalue of average energy for the\nsystem, and where \u03c1 =\ni pi \u03c1i is the average ensemble state. The classical capacity in this case is therefore\nobtained by maximizing the Holevo quantity \u03c7({pi , \u03c1i })\nover all possible ensembles {pi , \u03c1i } that satisfy the average energy constraint in Eq. (41):\np\nCE\n=\n\nmax\n\n{pi ,\u03c1i } satisfying Eq. (41)\n\n\u03c7({pi , \u03c1i }).\n\n(42)\n\nTherefore,\np\nCE\n\u2264\n\nmax\n\n{pi ,\u03c1i } satisfying Eq. (41)\n\nS(\u03c1).\n\n(43)\n\nHowever, the maximization on the rhs of the inequality\n(43) is the same as has already been considered in Sec.\n\nV D, since the number of photons is not conserved. The\nensemble that maximizes the rhs of Eq. (43) consists\nof the number states (Fock states), which are mutually\np\northogonal. Therefore, the capacity CE\nis attained for\nthis ensemble:\n!)!\n(\nX\n1\np\n.\n(44)\n\u03b2~\u03c9i ni\nexp \u2212\nCE\n=H\nZb\ni\nb\nHere\n(28), and H({ri }) =\nP Z is given by Eq.\n\u2212 i ri log2 ri is the Shannon entropy of a set of probabilities {ri }. Rewriting the capacity in terms of average\noccupation numbers, we obtain the classical capacity of\nchannels carrying photons as\nX\np\n[ni log2 ni \u2212 (1 + ni ) log2 (1 + ni )] , (45)\nCE\n=\u2212\ni\n\nwhere ni is given by the Eq. (29). Although we have obtained this capacity by maximizing the Holevo quantity,\nthe same result is also obtained by maximizing the accessible information in the single-copy (nonasymptotic)\ncase (see Eq. (5)).\nThe above classical capacity is obtained by using the\naverage energy constraint. Several other types of constraints on the energy are possible and all of them give\nthe same classical capacity to lowest order (see Ref. [8]).\n\nVIII. CHANNELS THAT CARRY MASSIVE\nINDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES\n\nLet us now move on to the case of a communication\nchannel that carries massive indistinguishable particles\n[13]. In this case, it is natural to impose the average\nparticle number constraint along with the average energy constraint. The classical capacity in this case is the\nmaximum of the Holevo quantity over all ensembles that\nsatisfy both these constraints, while the quantum ones\nare equal to the maximum of the entropy of the state\nthat satifies both these constraints. As we will see, both\nclassical and quantum capacities are equal for the noiseless channel.\nA system of noninteracting massive bosons exhibits\na Bose Einstein condensation: Below a certain critical\ntemperature, the number of particles in the lowest energy level (ground state) becomes a significant fraction\nof what is present in the whole system. In Ref. [13],\nwe considered the channel capacity in Eq. (50) below,\nand showed that it can exhibit the onset of the condensation. Here we present more details of the calculations\npresented there. The figures presented in Ref. [13] were\ncorresponding to the case where the bosons were confined\nto a three-dimensional cubic box with periodic boundary\nconditions. Here we consider the harmonic trap, which\nis actually more close to usual experimental procedures.\nUnless mentioned otherwise, we consider in this paper a\nharmonic trap in three dimensions.\n\n\f8\nLet us note that noninteracting photons, despite being bosons, do not show condensation, due to particle\nnumber nonconservation. However, effectively interacting photons may acquire an effective mass, and show\ncondensation (see for instance Ref.

(45))\n\nbe\nCE,N\n=\u2212\n\nXh\ni\n\nA.\n\nNoninteracting bosons\n\nSuppose that a quantum channel transmits spinless\nnoninteracting bosons described by the Hamiltonian\nP\n\u2020\nHb =\ni \u01ebi ai ai , and that they are confined to a trap\nof energy levels {\u01ebi }. We will begin by considering the\nclassical capacity.\n1.\n\nClassical capacity\n\nFor a system whose average energy and average particle number are given by E and N , the allowed ensembles\n{pi , \u03c1i } must satisfy the average energy constraint\ntr(Hb \u03c1) = E,\n\n(46)\n\nand the average particle number constraint\ntr(N \u03c1) = N,\nwhere N =\nbe\nCE,N\n=\n\nP\n\ni\n\n(51)\nAgain, the classical capacity obtained here by maximizing the Holevo quantity is the same as that obtained by\nmaximizing the accessible information in the single-copy\n(nonasymptotic) case (see Eq. (5)).\n2.\n\nWe now consider the case of quantum capacity. Consider the noiseless quantum channel that transmits arbitrary pure states of H\u2297n , such that the energy and\nnumber of particles (and not their average values) in any\nsuch pure state is nE and nN respectively. (Mixtures\nof such pure states are also noiselessly transmitted, by\nlinearity.) For a noiseless channel, the average fidelity\ncondition is automatically satisfied (see Eq. (11)). Consequently, the corresponding quantum capacity, Qn , irrespective of whether there is any classical side channel\n(see Sec. IV), is given by\n\na\u2020i ai . The classical capacity given by\nmax\n\nQn = log2 \u03a9(nE, nN ),\n\n\u03c7({pi , \u03c1i }).\n(48)\n\nTherefore,\nmax\n\n{pi ,\u03c1i } satisfying Eqs. (46) and (47)\n\nS(\u03c1).\n\n(49)\n\nOnce again, the maximization of the rhs of inequality\n(49) was considered before, in Sec. V C. There, it was\ndiscussed that the maximization of the rhs is attained by\nthe grand canonical ensemble. The grand canonical ensemble consists of number states, which are mutually orthogonal, and therefore, the channel capacity is attained\nfor that ensemble, so that\n!)!\n(\nX\n1\nbe\n.

So, we are now in the microcanonical ensemble. (To be more precise, one should allow for small fluctuations around nE and nN , but the\nderivation is similar.)\nThe system (described on the Hilbert space H\u2297n ) consists of n identical parts, each being described on the\nHilbert space H. Since the parts are identical, each part,\non average, has energy E and number of particles N .\nConsider one such part, and let l(\u01eb, m) be the dimension\nof the subspace of that part whose energy is \u01eb, and which\nconsists of m particles. (Again, we are disregarding fluctuations.) Then,\n\nl(\u01eb, m)\u03a9(nE \u2212 \u01eb, nN \u2212 m)\n\n\u01eb,m\n\n= loge\n\nX\n\nl(\u01eb, m) exp [loge \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E + E \u2212 \u01eb, (n \u2212 1)N + N \u2212 m)] ,\n\n\u01eb,m\n\nwhere we have\nE\u2212\u01eb\n\u226a 1,\n(n \u2212 1)E\n\nas we suppose that n is large (compare with e.g. [29]).\nN \u2212m\n\u226a 1,\n(n \u2212 1)N\n\n\f9\nTherefore we can expand loge \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E + E \u2212 \u01eb, (n \u2212\n\n1)N + N \u2212 m) as\n\nloge \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E + E \u2212 \u01eb, (n \u2212 1)N + N \u2212 m) = loge \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E, (n \u2212 1)N )\n\u2202 loge \u03a9\n\u2202 loge \u03a9\n+\n(E \u2212 \u01eb) +\n(N \u2212 m) + . . . .\n\u2202E\n\u2202N E=(n\u22121)E,N =(n\u22121)N\nE=(n\u22121)E,N =(n\u22121)N\n\n(52)\n\nTherefore,\nloge \u03a9(nE, nN ) = loge \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E, (n \u2212 1)N ) + loge\n\nX\n\nb\n\nl(\u01eb, m)e\u2212\u03b2\u01eb+\u03bc\n\n\u03b2m\n\n+ \u03b2E \u2212 \u03bcb \u03b2N\n\n\u01eb,m\n\nb\n= loge \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E, (n \u2212 1)N ) + loge ZGC\n(E, N ) + \u03b2E \u2212 \u03bcb \u03b2N,\n\nb\nwhere ZGC\n(E, N ) is the grand canonical partition function of the system described on H, and having average energy E and average particle number N . We will\nultimately be interested in dividing the logarithm of\n\u03a9(nE, nN ) by n and consider the limit as n \u2192 \u221e, and\nin that case, the further terms on the right-hand-side of\nEq. (52), after the third term, will not contribute. We\nnow use the \"fundamental equation for open systems\",\nb\n\u2212kB T loge ZGC\n= E \u2212 kB T (loge 2)S(E, N ) \u2212 \u03bcb N,\n\nwhere S(E, N ) is the von Neumann entropy of the grand\ncanonical state of the system described on H, and having\naverage energy E and average particle number N . (Note\nthat we are using the information theoretic definition of\nentropy as in Eq. (4), in which the multiplicative constant kB is absent, and the logarithm is to the base 2.)\nFinally therefore,\nlog2 \u03a9(nE, nN ) = log2 \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E, (n \u2212 1)N ) + S(E, N ).\nSimilarly,\nlog2 \u03a9((n \u2212 1)E, (n \u2212 1)N )\n= log2 \u03a9((n \u2212 2)E, (n \u2212 2)N ) + S(E, N ),\nso that\nlog2 \u03a9(nE, nN ) = log2 \u03a9((n\u22122)E, (n\u22122)N )+2S(E, N ).\nThis recursion can be carried on for p times, if n \u2212 p is\nlarge [30], so that we have\nlog2 \u03a9(nE, nN ) = log2 \u03a9((n\u2212p)E, (n\u2212p)N )+pS(E, N ).\n(53)\nWe moreover demand that lim np = 1, which can be\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nsatisfied even if n \u2212 p is large [31]. Since n \u2212 p \u226a n [32],\nwe have\n1\nlim\nlog2 \u03a9((n \u2212 p)E, (n \u2212 p)N ) = 0,\nn\u2192\u221e n\nso that\nlog2 \u03a9(nE, nN )\n= S(E, N ).\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\nlim\n\nTherefore, the quantum capacity, Qbe\nE,N , irrespective of\nwhether we have an additional side channel for classical\ninformation transfer, of a noiseless quantum channel that\ntransmits arbitrary states, \u03c1, of H, such that the average\nenergy tr(Hb \u03c1) = E and the average number of particles\ntr(N \u03c1) = N , is given by\nQbe\nE,N = lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog2 \u03a9(nE, nN )\n= S(E, N ).\nn\n\nWe therefore see that the quantum capacity is equal to\nthe classical capacity obtained in Sec. VIII A 1.\n3.\n\nSpinless bosons in a harmonic trap\n\nLet us now consider the case of noninteracting massive\nspinless bosons confined in a harmonic trap. The energy\nlevels are therefore\n~(\u03c9x nx + \u03c9y ny + \u03c9z nz ),\n\nnx , ny , nz = 0, 1, 2, . . . . (54)\n\nIn evaluating the capacity numerically, we must cut off\nthe infinite sequence of energy levels at some point. The\nevaluated \"capacity\" of course depends on the point of\nthe cut-off. In Fig. 1, we plot the channel capacity for the\ncase of 104 bosons (with respect to temperature), where\nwe show the \"capacities\" for the different points of the\ncut-off. In this case, the convergence is obtained roughly\nat about nx = ny = nz = 300. We see that the curves\nshow a sort of fracture at a certain temperature, changing\ntheir behavior from being concave to being convex with\nrespect to temperature. This can be seen more clearly in\nFig. 2, where we plot the derivative of the plots in the\npreceding figure. For calculating the derivative, we use a\nfour-point formula:\n1 h\ndf\nf (x \u2212 2\u2206x) \u2212 8f (x \u2212 \u2206x) + 8f (x + \u2206x)\n=\ndx\n12\u2206x\ni\n\u2212f (x + 2\u2206x) + O(\u2206x4 ).\n(55)\nIn the thermodynamic limit, this bending causes the\nderivative to have a discontinuity, and the corresponding\n\n\f10\n\n90000\n\nDerivative of capacity\n\n7000\n\n75000\n\nCapacity\n\n60000\n45000\n30000\n15000\n0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n6000\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\nT/Tc\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Capacity (in bits or qubits) as a function of the dimensionless variable T /Tc for N = 104 massive bosons in a harmonic trap, with different summation\nboundaries.

As seen in Figs. 3 and 4, the\ncritical temperature corresponding to the fracture grows\nwith N , as expected. The fractures indicate the onset\nof the condensation for the corresponding values of N .\nThe gap between the temperature corresponding to the\nfracture and the thermodynamic critical temperature is\nknown to exist, and estimated values of the gap has also\nbeen given (see Ref. [33]). Also, the capacities grow with\nthe number of particles, as expected.\nIt is known that the dimension of the system under\nconsideration plays a role in determining whether a condensation exists. For example, in the case of harmonic\ntraps, the 3D and 2D traps exhibits condensations, while\nthe 1D case does not show a condensation (see e.g. [33]).\nThe cases considered in the previous (and latter) figures\nare 3D harmonic traps.

Note that the capacity plotted with respect\nto energy does not indicate the condensation.\nNoninteracting fermions in a harmonic trap\n\nLet us now move over to the case of noninteracting\nfermions.

For sufficiently high temperatures, we have been able to obtain\nanalytical results in this respect, as we have already presented in the following theorem from Ref. [13]. Here, we\n\ngive a detailed proof of the theorem. We have already\nproven that the classical and quantum capacities are the\nsame in the case under study. For definiteness, we will\nconsider only the classical capacity in this section and\nthe succeeding one.\nTheorem.

The condition in Eq. (61) includes e.g. the\nharmonic trap in 2D and 3D, the 3D rectangular box,\nand the 3D spherical box.\nRemark 2. In the proof, we work up to order (N/S1 )3 ,\nand so the theorem holds for quite moderate temperatures.\nAt this point, please note that we have numerically\nchecked that the statement of the theorem holds also for\nlow temperatures for the harmonic trap and for the 3D\nrectangular box [13]. In Fig. 8, we compare the capacities\nof channels carrying bosons and fermions for N = 100 for\nthe case of a harmonic trap.\n\nX.\n\nLOW TEMPERATURE BEHAVIOR\n\nTherefore,\n\u03b1b2 \u2264 0 \u2264 \u03b1f2\n\n(89)\n\nAs we have already stressed, although the low temperature behavior of the capacity is not covered by the\n\n\f15\nficiently low temperatures in a bounded volume, such as\na 3D box.\nIn the case of a harmonic trap in 3D, the bosonic capacity scales as T 3 (see e.g. [37]), when the temperature\nis below critical. For sufficiently low temperatures, the\nfermionic capacity scales as T , which can be estimated\nby using the Sommerfeld expansions of Fermi functions.\nTherefore the fermionic capacity wins once again.\n\n1200\n1000\n\nCapacity\n\n800\n600\n\n1050\n\nXI.\n\n1040\n\n400\n\n1030\n\n200\n3.00\n\n3.05\n\n3.10\n\n3.15\n\n3.20\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nT/Tc\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Bosons vs. Fermions. We plot the\ncapacities (in bits or qubits) of spinless bosons and spinless\nfermions with respect to the dimensionless variable T /Tc , for\n100 particles. Note that the horizontal axis represents T /Tc\nfor both the curves. The lower curve is for bosons. The figure\nclearly agrees with our theorem. Moreover, this figure along\nwith other numerical simulations that we have performed, indicates that the theorem is true even for low temperatures.\nThe inset compares the behavior in an exemplary case at high\ntemperatures.\n\nTheorem in the preceding section, numerical simulations seems to indicate that the statement of the Theorem is indeed true for lower temperatures. In this\nsection, we want to point out that the statement can\nbe proven analytically in some circumstances, for low\ntemperatures. For example, for the case of a bounded\nvolume V , containing N particles at temperature T , if\nthe particles are bosons, then the capacity at low temperatures (specifically, for T \u2264 Tc , where in this case,\n\u0010\n\u0011 32\n2\u03c0\nN\nTc = ~2 mk\n) is given by (see e.g. [25])\nV \u03b6(3/2)\nB\nbe\nCV,N,T\n5V \u03b6(5/2)\n=\nlog2 e\n2~3\n\n\u0012\n\nmkB T\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013 23\n\n,\n\n3\n2\n\ni.e. the bosonic capacity \u223c T .

Clearly, the\nfermionic capacity is higher than the bosonic one for suf-\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the classical as well\nas the quantum capacity of noiseless quantum channels,\ncarrying massive particles. We have considered spinless noninteracting bosons and fermions. Noninteracting\nbosons exhibit Bose Einstein condensation, and we have\nshown that this critical behavior can also be observed\nby studying the capacity of a quantum channel carrying\nbosons. We show that the capacity of such channels is\nconcave (with respect to temperature) above the critical\ntemperature, while it is convex (with respect to temperature) below that point. This criticality is absent in the\ncase of fermions, as expected. We have numerically evaluated the capacities of bosons and fermions for different\nnumbers of particles. In the case of bosons, even in the\ncase of a small number of particles, say 100, condensation\ncan be observed from the qualitative change in behavior\nof the capacity.\nWe have also shown analytically that a channel carrying bosons is not as good a medium for transferring\nclassical as well as quantum information, as a channel\ncarrying fermions. This is true for a wide range of potentials that can be currently created in the laboratory. The\nanalytical calculation for power law potentials holds for\nmoderate temperatures. However, numerically we have\nchecked that this is true even for low temperatures. It\nis tempting to believe that such superiority of fermions\nover bosons is generic, at least for power-law potentials.\nIn special cases, we have considered the low temperature\nbehavior analytically, and have shown that for sufficiently\nlow temperatures, the fermionic capacity is higher than\nthe bosonic one, for the 3D box and the 3D harmonic\ntrap.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Sandro Stringari for important discussions,\nand the Horodeccy Family for sending us a draft of\nRef.
