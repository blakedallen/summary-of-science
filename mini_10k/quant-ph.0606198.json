This is mostly focused on the study of the complexvalued PT -symmetric potentials v for which the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\np2\n+ v(x),\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nhas a real discrete spectrum. In general the eigenvalue problem for H is defined along an appropriate contour \u0393 in the complex plane with suitable boundary conditions at infinity [1]. This\nallows one to identify H with a densely defined and generally non-self-adjoint operator acting in\na separable Hilbert space H, with the typical choice for H being L2 (\u0393).\nThe problem of whether and how one can formulate a consistent quantum system having\nH as its Hamiltonian has found a satisfactory solution within the context of pseudo-Hermitian\nquantum mechanics [2, 3, 4, 5]. It turns out that H must be diagonalizable. In particular, there\nmust exist a complete basis of H consisting of eigenvectors of H. This is a physical requirement\nof the standard quantum measurement postulate [2, 6]. For a diagonalizable Hamiltonian with a\ndiscrete spectrum, the reality of the spectrum is equivalent to the existence of a positive-definite\ninner product h*, *i+ that renders H self-adjoint [7, 8]. The latter is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the existence of an equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian h that acts in H, [7, 9]. These\nobservations lead to the realization that the physical system under investigation may be equally\nwell described by a Hermitian Hamiltonian within the framework of the conventional quantum\nmechanics [10, 11, 2].\nThe above discussion also applies to complex potentials that are not PT -symmetric. The\npurpose of this paper is to study in detail one of the simplest (though highly nontrivial) examples\nof complex potentials that happens not to be PT -symmetric, namely the delta-function potential\nwith a complex coupling:\nv(x) = \u03b6\u03b4(x),\n\u03b6 \u2208 C.\n(2)\nWe wish to explore the possibility of defining a unitary quantum system based on the standard\nHamiltonian (1) and the potential (2). The reference Hilbert space [2] is given by H = L2 (R)\nand it is not difficult to see that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian fails to be discrete. Because\nof the presence of the continuous part of the spectrum the results reported in [12, 7] may not\nhold. Nevertheless, they provide some useful guiding principles that we will follow. Specifically,\nwe will attempt to construct a biorthonormal system whenever possible and use it to define an\nappropriate positive-definite inner product that renders H self-adjoint. An example of a successful\napplication of this strategy is the scattering potential [5]\n(\n\u2212i\u03bb sign(x) for |x| < L2\n,\n(3)\nv(x) =\n0\nfor |x| > L2 ,\n2\n\n\fwhere \u03bb \u2208 R, L \u2208 R+ , and\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u22121 for x < 0\nsign(x) :=\n0 for x = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1 for x > 0.\n\nNote that unlike (3), the delta-function potential (2) fails to be PT -symmetric, and as we will\nsee, depending on the value of \u03b6, it may lead to the presence of a spectral singularity [13].\nBefore starting our analysis of the properties of (2), we wish to point out that complex potentials consisting of one or more delta functions have been studied in [14] \u2013 [21] and that the issue of\nthe emergence of spectral singularities for PT -symmetric potentials has been considered in [22].\n\n2\n\nSpectral Properties and Biorthonormal Systems\n\nConsider the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nH\u03c8 = E\u03c8\n\n(4)\n\nsubject to bounded boundary conditions at x = \u00b1\u221e. Substituting (1) and (2) in (4) and introducing the dimensionless quantities:\nx :=\n\nx\n,\nl\n\nz :=\n\n2ml\u03b6\n,\n~2\n\nE :=\n\n2ml2 E\n,\n~2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere l is an arbitrary length scale, we can express (4) in the form\n\u2212 \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (x) + z\u03b4(x)\u03c8(x) = E\u03c8(x).\n\n(6)\n\nClearly E belongs to the spectrum of the dimensionless Hamiltonian\nH :=\n\n2ml2\nd2\nH\n=\n\u2212\n+ z \u03b4(x).\n~2\ndx2\n\n(7)\n\nThe solution of (6) has the form\n\u03c8(x) = \u03c8k (x) :=\n\n(\n\nA\u2212 eikx + B\u2212 e\u2212ikx for x < 0\nA+ eikx + B+ e\u2212ikx for x \u2265 0,\n\n(8)\n\n\u221a\nwhere k := E, the coefficients A\u2212 , B\u2212 \u2208 C are arbitrary but not both vanishing, i.e., |A\u2212 |2 +\n|B\u2212 |2 6= 0, and\nA+ = (1 \u2212\n\niz\niz\n)A\u2212 \u2212\nB\u2212 ,\n2k\n2k\n\nB+ =\n\niz\niz\nA\u2212 + (1 + )B\u2212 .\n2k\n2k\n\n(9)\n\nA straightforward implication of (8) and (9) is that whenever R(z) < 0 there is a solution \u03c8k\nwith k = iz/2 that belongs to L2 (R), i.e., the spectrum consists of the obvious real, nonnegative,\ncontinuous part and a single eigenvalue: E := \u2212z 2 /4.\n3\n\n\fThe presence of a pair (A\u2212 , B\u2212 ) of arbitrary constants in the expression for the eigenfunctions\n\u03c8k is an indication that the energy levels are doubly degenerate. The application of the program of\npseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics [2] requires the construction of a complete biorthonormal\nsystem consisting of the eigenfunctions of H and H\u2020 . The first step in this direction is to make a\nconvenient choice for basis eigenfunctions within each degeneracy subspace. It is most convenient\nto choose one of these eigenfunctions reflectionless [23] \u2013 [25]. This would allow one to express\nthis eigenfunction using a formula that is valid for both x < 0 and x \u2265 0. It is not difficult to\nsee that sin(kx) is such a reflectionless eigenfunction. Moreover, the fact that sin(kx) is an odd\nfunction suggests to choose the second basis eigenfunction to be even.1 As we will see below, this\nchoice simplifies the imposition of the biorthogonality conditions considerably.\nDenoting the eigenfunctions by \u03c8\u0303ak , with a = 1, 2 being the degeneracy label, we set\n1\n\u03c8\u03031k (x) := \u221a sin(kx),\n\u03c0\ni\n1 h\nz\nk\nsin(kx) sign(x) .\n\u03c8\u03032 (x) := \u221a\ncos(kx) +\n\u03c0\n2k\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nWe can construct the following eigenfunctions of H\u2020 by replacing z by z \u2217 in the above formulas.\n1\n\u03c6\u0303k1 (x) := \u221a sin(kx),\n\u03c0\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nz\u2217\nk\nsin(kx) sign(x) .\n\u03c6\u03032 (x) := \u221a\ncos(kx) +\nk\n\u03c0\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nNext, we wish to check the validity of the biorthonormality relation for the system {\u03c8\u0303ak , \u03c6\u0303ka }.\nR\u221e\nUsing the well-known integral representation of the delta function, \u03b4(k) = (2\u03c0)\u22121 \u2212\u221e eikx dx, the\nparity of the eigenfunctions, and the fact that k + q > 0, we immediately find\nh\u03c8\u03031k |\u03c6\u0303q2 i = h\u03c8\u03032k |\u03c6\u0303q1 i = 0.\n\nh\u03c8\u03031k |\u03c6\u0303q1 i = \u03b4(k \u2212 q),\n\n(14)\n\nMuch more complicated is the derivation of2\nz \u22172\n) \u03b4(k \u2212 q) + \u03c0z \u2217 \u03b4(k)\u03b4(q)\n2\n4k\nz \u22172\nfor k, q > 0.\n= (1 + 2 ) \u03b4(k \u2212 q),\n4k\n\nh\u03c8\u03032k |\u03c6\u0303q2 i = (1 +\n\n(15)\n\nAs seen from (15), the system {\u03c8\u0303ak , \u03c6\u0303ka } fails to be biorthogonal for z = \u00b12ik, because \u03c6\u0303k2 is\northogonal to both \u03c8\u03031q and \u03c8\u03032q for all q \u2208 R+ . This is an indication of the presence of a spectral\nsingularity, namely E = \u2212z 2 /4, which occurs whenever z is purely imaginary3 and is consequently\nembedded in the continuous spectrum of H.\n1\n\nThis is possible, because the Hamiltonian is parity-invariant (P-symmetric).\nHere we used the identity \u03b4(k) = limn\u2192\u221e sin(nk)/(\u03c0k).\n3\nThis is because k \u2208 R+ and z = \u00b12ik.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\fA spectral singularity is a serious defect that rules out the operator as a viable candidate for a\nphysical observable. We will therefore only consider non-imaginary couplings z. In particular, we\nwill focus our attention on the cases where z (and hence \u03b6) has a positive real part (R(z) > 0), so\nthat there is no eigenvalue and the spectrum is R+ \u222a {0}. In this case, we can define\n1\n\u03c81k (x) := \u221a sin(kx),\n\u03c0\n\u03c6k1 (x)\n\n1\n:= \u221a sin(kx),\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c82k (x) :=\n\nz\nsin(kx) sign(x)\ncos(kx) + 2k\nq\n,\n\u0001\nz2\n\u03c0 1 + 4k\n2\n\n(16)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c6k2 (x)\n\nwhich satisfy the biorthonormality condition\n\nz\nsin(kx) sign(x)\ncos(kx) + 2k\nq\n:=\n,\n\u0001\nz \u22172\n\u03c0 1 + 4k\n2\n\nh\u03c8ak |\u03c6qb i = \u03b4ab \u03b4(k \u2212 q).\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nClearly, this relation is invariant under the transformations\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8ak (x) \u2192 \u03c8ak (x) := Na (z, k)\u03c8ak (x),\n\n\u03c6ka (x) \u2192 \u03c6ak (x) := Na (z, k)\u22121\u2217 \u03c6ka (x),\n\n(19)\n\nwhere Na : C \u00d7 R+ \u2192 C are functions that tend to 1 as k \u2192 \u221e and Na (z, k)\u00b11 do not vanish\nexcept possibly for imaginary values of z.\n\n3\n\nConstruction of a Metric Operator\n\nExtending the results of [12, 7] to the model under investigation, we wish to construct a positivedefinite metric operator of the form [5, 26, 27]\n\u03b7+ =\n\n2 Z\nX\na=1\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ndk |\u03c6ka ih\u03c6ka |.\n\n(20)\n\nThis operator defines a positive-definite inner product h*, *i+ := h*|\u03b7+ *i that renders H self-adjoint\nand specifies the physical Hilbert space Hphys of the model [2]. Note, however, that the metric\n\u2032\noperator (20) is not unique [28] \u2013 [31]; one can use \u03c6ak of (19) to construct other admissible metric\noperators. Indeed, the determination of the coefficient functions Na (z, k) that would reproduce the\nusual metric operator (\u03b7+ = 1) and the (L2 -) inner product in the Hermitian limit (I(z) \u2192 0) is a\nvery difficult problem. The only guiding principle is to make a simple choice for the biorthonormal\nsystem that shares the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. In the following we will see that the choice\n(16)-(17) made in the preceding section does indeed fulfill this highly nontrivial requirement.\nHaving made a choice for \u03c6ka , we can try to compute the integral kernel for \u03b7+ , namely\n\u03b7+ (x, y) := hx|\u03b7+ |yi =\n\n2 Z\nX\na=1\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndk \u03c6ka (x)\u03c6ka (y)\u2217 .\n\n(21)\n\n\fSubstituting (16) and (17) in this equation and simplifying the result, we obtain\n\u03b7+ (x, y) =\n\n1\n[\u03b4(x \u2212 y) \u2212 \u03b4(x + y)] + \u03b1(x, y) + z\u03b2(x, y) sign(y) +\n2\nz \u2217 \u03b2(y, x) sign(x) + |z|2 \u03b3(x, y) sign(x) sign(y),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\n\u221e\n\ncos(kx) cos(ky)\n1\n=\n[I0 (x + y) + I0 (x \u2212 y)],\nz2\n4\u03c0\n1 + 4k2\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\ncos(kx) sin(ky)\n1\n1\ndk\n[I1 (x + y) + I1 (y \u2212 x)],\n=\n\u03b2(x, y) :=\n2\nz\n4\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n8\u03c0i\nk 1 + 4k2\nZ \u221e\nsin(kx) sin(ky)\n1\n1\ndk\n=\n[I2 (x \u2212 y) \u2212 I2 (x + y)],\n\u03b3(x, y) :=\n2\nz\n8\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n16\u03c0\nk 2 1 + 4k\n2\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\neirk\neirk\nq\nIn (r) :=\ndk\n=\ndk\n,\nz2\nz2\nz \u22172\nk n 1 + 4k\nn\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n2\nk\n(1 + 4k2 )(1 + 4k2 )\n\n1\n\u03b1(x, y) :=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ndk\n\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n(26)\n\nr \u2208 R, and n = 0, 1, 2. As seen from (22) \u2013 (26), the calculation of \u03b7+ (x, y) reduces to that of\nIn (r). The latter cannot be evaluated in a closed form. We will construct a series expansion for\nIn (r) that would allow for a perturbative treatment of the problem.\nFirst, we introduce\nr\nb\nI(z)2\nI(z)\nR(z)2\n,\nb :=\n,\n\u01eb :=\n=\n,\n(27)\na :=\n4\n4\nR(z)\na\nk\n2k\nR(z)r \u221a\n= a r,\n=\u221a ,\nq :=\ns :=\n(28)\n2\nR(z)\na\nwhere R and I stand for the real and imaginary part of their argument, respectively.4\nIt is not difficult to show that\nZ \u221e\neisq q 2\u2212n f (q, \u01eb)\n(1\u2212n)/2\n,\nIn (r) = a\ndq\n\u221a\nq2 + 1\n\u2212\u221e\ns= a r\nwhere\nf (q, \u01eb) :=\n\n\u0012\n\n[\u01eb2 + 2(1 \u2212 q 2 )]\u01eb2\n1+\n(q 2 + 1)2\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nIn view of these equations, we may use \u01eb as an appropriate non-Hermiticity parameter. In the\nfollowing we will construct a perturbative expansion of the metric operator in terms of \u01eb.\nExpanding f (q, \u01eb) in powers of \u01eb, we have\nf (q, \u01eb) = 1 +\n4\n\nq 2 \u2212 1 2 q 4 \u2212 4q 2 + 1 4\n\u01eb +\n\u01eb + O(\u01eb6 ),\n(q 2 + 1)2\n(q 2 + 1)4\n\nNote that R(z) and a are both positive.\n\n6\n\n(31)\n\n\fwhere O(\u01ebN ) stands for terms of order N and higher in powers of \u01eb. Substituting (31) in (29) and\nevaluating the resulting integrals yields, after a very lengthy calculation that is partly done by\nMathematica, the following remarkably simple result.\n\u0014 \u2212|s|\n\u0015 \u001b\n\u001a\n\u221a\ne\ne\u2212|s|\n2\n+\n(s \u2212 3|s| + 1) \u01eb2\n+ O(\u01eb4 ),\n(32)\nI0 (r) = 2\u03c0 a \u03b4(s) \u2212\n\u221a\n2\n8\ns= a r\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u001b\n1\n\u2212|s|\n1 + (1 \u2212 |s|)|s| \u01eb2\nI1 (r) = i\u03c0 sign(s) e\n+ O(\u01eb4 ),\n(33)\n\u221a\n4\ns= a r\n\u0015 \u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u03c0 \u2212|s|\n1 2\n+ O(\u01eb4 ).\n(34)\nI2 (r) = \u221a e\n1 + \u2212 (s + |s| + 1) \u01eb2\n\u221a\n4\na\ns= a r\nHaving obtained In (r), we are in a position to derive an explicit perturbative expansion for\nthe metric operator:\nN\n\u22121\nX\n(m)\n\u03b7+ (x, y) =\n\u03b7+ (x, y) \u01ebm + O(\u01ebN ),\n(35)\nm=0\n\n(m)\n\nwhere N = 1, 2, 3, * * * and \u03b7+ (x, y) is independent of \u01eb. Inserting (32) \u2013 (34) in (23) \u2013 (25), using\nthe resulting expression to write (22) in the form (35), and employing various properties of \"sign\",\nparticularly\nsign(x + y)[sign(x) + sign(y)] = 1 + sign(x)sign(y) = 2 \u03b8(xy),\nwhere \u03b8(x) := [1 + sign(x)]/2 is the step function, we find after miraculous cancellations of a large\nnumber of terms\n(0)\n\n\u03b7+ (x, y) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n\u0003\niR(z) \u0002\n(1)\n\u03b8(xy) e\u2212R(z)|x\u2212y|/2 + \u03b8(\u2212xy) e\u2212R(z)|x+y|/2 sign(y2 \u2212 x2 ),\n\u03b7+ (x, y) =\n4\nR(z) \b\n(2)\n\u03b7+ (x, y) =\n[\u2212R(z)|x \u2212 y| \u03b8(xy) + \u03b8(\u2212xy)] e\u2212R(z)|x\u2212y|/2 +\n16\n[\u2212R(z)|x + y| \u03b8(\u2212xy) + \u03b8(xy)] e\u2212R(z)|x+y|/2 ,\niR(z)2 \b\n(3)\n\u03b8(xy)|x \u2212 y|(1 \u2212 12 R(z)|x \u2212 y|) e\u2212R(z)|x\u2212y|/2 +\n\u03b7+ (x, y) =\n32\n\u03b8(\u2212xy)|x + y|(1 \u2212 21 R(z)|x + y|) e\u2212R(z)|x+y|/2 sign(y2 \u2212 x2 ).\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\nWe should emphasize that according to (36) the metric operator \u03b7+ tends to the identity operator\nin the Hermitian limit: \u01eb \u2192 0. This is by no means a trivial expectation. It is a consequence of\n(m)\nour choice for the biorthonormal system. Moreover \u03b7+ (x, y) satisfy the Hermiticity condition,\n(m)\n(m)\n(m)\n\u03b7+ (x, y)\u2217 = \u03b7+ (y, x), manifestly. A more important property of \u03b7+ (x, y) is that they define\n(m)\nbounded (integral) operators \u03b7+ in all of L2 (R). This can be established using the fact that the\nR \u221e (m)\nintegrals \u2212\u221e |\u03b7+ (x, y)|dy are bounded for all x \u2208 R, [32, \u00a7III.2.1]. Alternatively, we may employ\n(m)\nthe following direct proof of the boundedness of \u03b7+ for m = 0, 1, 2, 3, [33]. First we observe\n(m)\nthat |\u03b7+ (x, y)| viewed as a function of x has an upper bound, \u03bc(m) (y), depending on y such that\n7\n\n\fc :=\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03bc(m) (y)dy < \u221e. This implies that for all \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (R),\nk\n\n(m)\n\u03b7+ \u03c8\n\nk\n\n2\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u221e\n\n(m)\n\ndy \u03b7+ (x, y)\u03c8(y)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\n\u00132\nq\n(m)\n(m)\n\u2264\ndx\ndy \u03bc (x) \u03bc (y) |\u03c8(y)|\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n(m)\n(m)\n\u2264\ndx \u03bc (x)\ndy \u03bc (y)\ndx|\u03c8(y)|2 = c2 k \u03c8 k2 ,\nZ\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(40)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\nwhere we have used the identities: |\u03b7+ (x, y)| \u2264 \u03bc(m) (y), |\u03b7+ (x, y)| = |\u03b7+ (y, x)| \u2264 \u03bc(m) (x), and\n(m)\nthe Schwarz inequality [34]. This completes the proof of the boundedness of \u03b7+ for m = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nIt implies that at least up to the third order terms in \u01eb, \u03b7+ is a bounded operator acting in all of\nL2 (R).\nWe conclude this section by noting that although the Hamiltonian H is manifestly non-PT symmetric, we can follow the approach pursued in [27] to define an antilinear symmetry generator\n(generalized PT -operator [29]) for this Hamiltonian according to\n\u03c4 :=\n\n2 Z\nX\na=1\n\n\u221e\n0\n\ndk (\u22121)a |\u03c8ak i \u22c6 h\u03c6ka |,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere \u22c6 is complex-conjugation operator defined by (\u22c6h\u03be|)|\u03b6i := h\u03b6|\u03bei, for all \u03c8, \u03b6 \u2208 L2 (R).

The result is [30]\nd2\n(43)\nh = \u2212 2 + R(z) \u03b4(x) + h(2) \u01eb2 + O(\u01eb3 ),\ndx\n8\n\n\fwhere\n\niR(z) (1)\n[\u03b7+ , \u03b4(x)].\n4\nIn view of (37) and (44), we can easily compute\nh(2) :=\n\niR(z)\n(1)\n[\u03b4(y) \u2212 \u03b4(x)] \u03b7+ (x, y),\n4\n\u0003\nR(z)2 \u0002\n=\n\u03b4(x) e\u2212R(z)|y|/2 + \u03b4(y) e\u2212R(z)|x|/2 ,\n16\n\n(44)\n\nhx|h(2) |yi =\n\n(45)\n\nwhere the latter expression is to be treated in the sense of distributions (it is valid inside an\nintegral).\nNext, we express the Hermitian Hamiltonian h in terms of the original (unscaled) physical\nvariables and the relevant length scale of the problem which, as we explain below, is given by\nL :=\nThis yields\n\n~2\n.\nm R(\u03b6)\n\n(46)\n\np2\n+ R(\u03b6) \u03b4(x) + I(\u03b6)2 h(2) + O(I(\u03b6)3),\n2m\nis defined in terms of its integral kernel,\nh=\n\nwhere h(2)\n\nh(2) (x, y) :=\naccording to\n(2)\n\n(h \u03c8)(x) :=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0003\nm \u0002\n\u2212|y|/L\n\u2212|x|/L\n\u03b4(x)\ne\n+\n\u03b4(y)\ne\n,\n8~2\n\nh(2) (x, y) \u03c8(y) dy = c0 [\u03c8] e\u2212|x|/L + c1 [\u03c8] \u03b4(x),\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nm\u03c8(0)\n,\nc0 [\u03c8] :=\n8~2\n\nm\nc1 [\u03c8] := 2\n8~\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\n(49)\n\ne\u2212|y|/L \u03c8(y) dy.\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nClearly h(2) and consequently h are nonlocal operators [2]. Furthermore, they are both real (T symmetric) and P-symmetric.5\nTo demonstrate the physical consequences of the imaginary part of the coupling constant \u03b6\nin the original Hamiltonian (1) and appreciate the meaning of the length scale L, we calculate\nthe energy expectation value for a Gaussian position wave function centered at x = 0 and having\nmean momentum p\u0304 = ~k and width \u03c3,\nx2\n\n\u03a8(x) = (\u03c0\u03c3 2 )\u22121/4 e\u2212 2\u03c32 +ikx .\n\n(50)\n\nIt is important to note that we work solely in the Hermitian representation of the quantum system\nwhere h represents the Hamiltonian of the system and x the position operator. Naturally, we view\n\u03a8 as an element of H which yields the probability density of the localization of the particle in the\n\u22121/2\nphysical space as |\u03a8(x)|2 .

As seen from these plots\nthe non-Hermiticity effect is substantially smaller for mean positions outside [\u2212L, L]. Therefore,\nL determines the range of the non-Hermitian (nonlocal) interaction.\nIn order to make a crude estimate for the magnitude L, consider the application of the delta\nfunction potential in modelling a point defect in a one-dimensional electron gas system. If we take\nthe spatial size d of the defect (lattice size of the crystal) to be of the order of 1 Angstrom and\nthe strength of the real part of the potential6 to be of the order of 1 ev, for an electron (of usual\nmass) we find L to be of the order 10\u221210 Angstrom! Similarly we can obtain an order of magnitude\nestimate for the strength of the non-Hermitian interaction namely mR(z)2 /(8~2 d). This turns out\nto be 108\u01eb2 ev. Therefore, to ensure the validity of our perturbative calculation of h, we need to\ntake \u01eb \u226a 10\u22124 . We also recall that the non-Hermitian interaction will be significant, if it is stronger\nthan the thermal effects, i.e., mR(z)2 /(8~2 d) > kT . At room temperature (kT \u2248 10\u22122 ev), this\nimplies \u01eb > 10\u22125.\nFinally, we would like to point out that the calculation of the energy expectation value can\nbe performed using the pseudo-Hermitian representation of the system. This requires calculation\n\u22121/2\nof the state vector \u03c8 = \u03b7+ \u03a8 corresponding to the position wave function \u03a8. The energy\n6\n\nHere we write the real part of the potential as d\u22121 R(z)\u03b4(d\u22121 x) and identify d\u22121 R(z) with its strength.\n\n11\n\n\fexpectation value then takes the form h\u03c8, H\u03c8i+ = h\u03c8|\u03b7+ H\u03c8i. This calculation is by no means\neasier to perform than the one reported above [11, 41]. It simplifies to some extend, if one chooses\n\u03c8 directly, e.g., identify \u03c8(x) with a Gaussian wave packet. However, note that \u03c8(x) is void of a\ndirect physical meaning; it is not the position wave function for the state it describes. In order\nto assign a physical meaning for \u03c8 in terms of the position of the particle, one must compute the\n1/2\ncorresponding position wave function [2], namely \u03a8 = \u03b7+ \u03c8.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we applied the machinery of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics to explore a\nunitary quantum system determined by a delta function potential with a complex coupling constant \u03b6. For an imaginary coupling constant there exists a spectral singularity. For R(\u03b6) > 0\nthe spectrum is purely continuous and one can construct a complete biorthonormal system. The\ndouble degeneracy of the spectrum complicates the choice of a biorthonormal system. We selected\nan appropriate biorthonormal system that simplified the calculations and had a symmetric expression for the pair of basis eigenfunctions associated with each degeneracy subspace. We then\nconstructed the corresponding metric operator \u03b7+ perturbatively and showed that it tended to\nthe identity operator in the non-Hermitian limit and was indeed a bounded operator at least up\nto and including the third order terms that we computed. This is quite remarkable, for there are\nan infinity of other biorthonormal systems such that the corresponding metric operator is either\nunbounded or fails to yield the identity operator in the Hermitian limit.\nNext, we constructed the equivalent nonlocal Hermitian Hamiltonian h for the system. The nature of the nonlocality of h is quite intriguing, because it originates from a complex delta-function\npotential which is actually ultra-local! This seems to be the reason why the non-Hermiticity effect\nappears in the Hermitian Hamiltonian in the form of a short range interaction, i.e. it decays\n2\nrapidly outside the interaction region: [\u2212L, L], where L = m ~R(\u03b6) . To establish this we calculated\nthe expectation value of energy for various Gaussian position wave functions. For a non-stationary\nGaussian wave packet centered at the origin, the non-Hermitian effect reaches its maximum for\nmean momenta in the range [\u2212~L\u22121 , ~L\u22121 ]. For a stationary wave packet, it becomes sizable\nwhenever the mean position of the packet lies within the interaction region [\u2212L, L].\nThe results reported above show how the methods developed for treating systems with a\ndiscrete spectrum [7, 2] generalize to specific models with a continuous spectrum. Such a generalization has previously been employed in the treatment of the PT -symmetric potential (3)\nas reported in [5]. The delta function potential considered in the present paper is manifestly\nnon-PT -symmetric, yet we could successfully apply the methods of pseudo-Hermitian quantum\nmechanics [2, 3, 4, 30] to reveal its physical content.\n\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nDuring the course of this work I have benefitted from helpful discussions with Alkan Kabak\u00e7lo\u011flu\nand Varga Kalantarov.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
