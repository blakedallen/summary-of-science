Currently, we are able to measure\nthe position of a well-exposed star with a precision of \u223c4 mas/frame in each\ncoordinate (under 0.8 arcsec seeing conditions). We present some preliminary\nresults here.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last few years, several Wide Field Imagers (WFIs) at the focus of large\nground-based telescopes have become operative (MPI-ESO 2.2m, AAT 4m, CFH\n4m), and their number is continuously increasing (LBT 2\u00d78m, VST 2.5m,\nUKIRT 3.8m, VISTA 4m, etc.), as well as their field of view. These WFIs\nhave allowed us to map completely a number of open and globular clusters in\nour Galaxy, and to get accurate photometry for large numbers of stars, with the\nadditional possibility of studying fast-evolving phases of stellar evolution. By\ndefinition, the WFIs allow large radial coverage in a cluster, so that we can study\nthe radial distribution of stars in different sequences of the color\u2013magnitude diagram (CMD) and of peculiar objects, which allows us to investigate the effect\nof the environment on the evolution of the cluster stars. The wide field coverage has made the study of tidal tails in open and globular clusters much more\npracticable.\nAmong the most interesting opportunities offered by the WFIs (still largely\nunexplored) are in their astrometric performance. Accurate astrometry over\nwide fields is important for a number of reasons. First of all, an accuracy of 0.2\narcsec or better is required to point the fibers of multi-fiber spectroscopic facilities (e.g., FLAMES+GIRAFFE/VLT at ESO). However, the most promising\napplications lie in the proper-motion measurements of a large number of stars.\nWFIs allow astrometric measurements with an accuracy of far better than 0.2\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1. On the left, an image from the WFI/MPI-ESO 2.2m\n(WFI@2.2m), centered on the Galactic open cluster NGC 2477. On the right,\nOMEGACAM, a WFI four times as large (both in field coverage, and in number of pixels). OMEGACAM will be mounted at the beginning of 2006 at the\nfocus of the VST-ESO 2.5m telescope. This telescope has been specifically\ndesigned for wide field imaging, and we we expect that OMEGACAM will\nprovide better astrometry than the WFI@2.2m.\n\narcsec. With a baseline of a few years, images collected with modern WFIs\ncan provide proper motions more accurate than those obtainable with old plates\nwith a baseline of several decades. (Note, though, that these plates will still\nremain valuable for long-term non-linear astrometry, such as the determination\nof the orbit of long-period visual binaries, and of course for long-term variation\nin the light curves).\n2.\n\nAstrometry: The importance of a careful PSF modeling\n\nIn the last year, we have started to apply to wide field ground-based images what\nwe have learned from Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) (Anderson & King 2000,\n2003, Anderson 2004). For accurate astrometry the ability to reproduce the the\ncore of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is of crucial importance, much more\nso than for accurate PSF-fitting photometry. In fact, the PSF core (where the\nderivatives of the stellar profile are highest) contains almost all the astrometric\ninformation. The PSF core needs to be carefully modeled, as does its dependence\non the spatial position within the detector. Moreover, the core of the PSF needs\nto be represented with adequate sampling. In Figure 2 we show the precision\nachieved in measuring stellar positions in images collected at the WFI@2.2m,\nunder 1\u2032\u2032.2 seeing conditions. We verified that a seeing of 0\u2032\u2032.8 improves the\nprecision by \u223c30%.\nAt the moment our main limitation comes from the geometric distortion of\nthe focal plane, and we are working on an algorithm to correct for it. Before\nwe can correct for it, we must of course understand what the nature of the\ndistortion is, in terms of (1) what order of polynomial best characterizes it, (2)\nwhether there is any fine-scale component added by the filters or other optical\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2. Errors in measuring star positions vs. instrumental magnitude,\nin a sample of WFI@2.2m images collected under seeing conditions of 1\u2032\u2032.2.\nThe instrumental magnitude is defined as \u22122.5 log10 of the Digital Numbers\n(DN).\n\nelements and (3) whether it changes over time. Even if we cannot perfectly\ncharacterize the distortion, it is still possible to minimize its effect on astrometry\neither by taking a set of exposures at a variety of pointing offsets or by doing\ntransformations in a more local way (Bedin et al. 2003).\n\n3.\n\nExample: M4 field decontamination in 2.2 years\n\nFigure 3 shows an example of the proper-motion potential of ground-based wide\nfield imagers; we present preliminary results on field-star removal in part of\nthe low-Galactic-latitude globular cluster M4. Observations collected at the\nWFI@2.2m in two epochs separated by a time baseline of just 2.2 years already\nallow an excellent separation.\nThe first-epoch data consist of 3\u00d775s + 2\u00d755s B-band images taken on December 6, 1999, and the second-epoch data consist of 3\u00d7180s images in the same\nband, and 3\u00d7120s V -band images, taken on February 19, 2002. In order to avoid\nfirst-order color terms, we use only the B images to derive the proper motions,\nand we use only the cluster MS stars as reference stars in the transformation,\nso that stars moving with the cluster will have zero displacement. The top left\npanel of Figure 3 shows the vector point diagram of the displacements, in units\nof WFI pixels (238 mas/pixel). From high-accuracy astrometric measurements\non HST data, Bedin et al. (2003) have shown that the average proper-motion\ndisplacement between cluster stars and field objects is \u223c17 mas/yr. Since our\nastrometric errors increase rapidly toward fainter magnitudes, we consider as\ncluster members all the stars with a proper motion which differs by less than 10\nmas/yr from the average proper motion of the cluster MS stars.\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 3. Proper-motion measurements in a field of M4, using two sets of\nWFI@2.2m images separated by only 2.2 yr.\n\nThis example must be considered as an application that is still very preliminary, but it shows the importance of high-accuracy astrometry on wide field\nground-based images.\nAcknowledgments.\nmanuscript.\n\nWe thank Ivan R.
