Then compensation conditions (see again [3]) will\nconsist in demand of full connected tree-gluon vertices, following from Lagrangian L0 , to be\nzero. This demand gives a non-linear equation for form-factor F .\nThese equations according to terminology of works [4, 5] are called compensation\nequations. In a study of these equations it is always evident the existence of a perturbative\ntrivial solution (in our case G = 0), but, in general, a non-perturbative non-trivial solution\nmay also exist. Just the quest of a non-trivial solution inspires the main interest in such\nproblems. One can not succeed in finding an exact non-trivial solution in a realistic theory,\ntherefore the goal of a study is a quest of an adequate approach, the first non-perturbative\napproximation of which describes the main features of the problem. Improvement of a\nprecision of results is to be achieved by corrections to the initial first approximation.\nThus our task is to formulate the first approximation. Here the experience acquired in\nthe course of performing works [1, 2, 3] could be helpful. Now in view of obtaining the first\napproximation we would make the following assumptions.\n1) In compensation equation we restrict ourselves by terms with loop numbers 0, 1.\n2) In expressions thus obtained we perform a procedure of linearizing, which leads to linear\nintegral equations. It means that in loop terms only one vertex contains the form-factor,\nbeing defined above, while other vertices are considered to be point-like. In diagram form\nequation for form-factor F is presented in Fig.1. Here four-leg vertex correspond to interaction of four gluons due to our effective three-field interaction. In our approximation we take\nhere point-like vertex with interaction constant proportional to g G.\n3) We integrate by angular variables of the 4-dimensional Euclidean space. The necessary\nrules are presented in papers [1],[3].\nAt first let us present the expression for four-gluon vertex\n\u0010\n\u0010\nV (p, m, \u03bb; q, n, \u03c3; k, r, \u03c4, l, s, \u03c0) = gG f amn f ars U(k, l; \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03c0, \u03bb) \u2212 U(k, l; \u03bb, \u03c4, \u03c0, \u03c3) \u2212\n2\n\n\f\u2212U(l, k; \u03c3, \u03c0, \u03c4, \u03bb) + U(l, k; \u03bb, \u03c0, \u03c4, \u03c3) + U(p, q; \u03c0, \u03bb, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) \u2212 U(p, q; \u03c4, \u03bb, \u03c3, \u03c0) \u2212\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212U(q, p; \u03c0, \u03c3, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) + U(q, p; \u03c4, \u03c3, \u03bb, \u03c0) \u2212 f arn f ams U(p, l; \u03c3, \u03bb, \u03c0, \u03c4 ) \u2212\n\n\u2212U(l, p; \u03c3, \u03c0, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) \u2212 U(p, l; \u03c4, \u03bb, \u03c0, \u03c3) + U(l, p; \u03c4, \u03c0, \u03bb, \u03c3) + U(k, q; \u03c0, \u03c4, \u03c3, \u03bb) \u2212\n\u0011\n\u2212U(q, k; \u03c0, \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03bb) \u2212 U(k, q; \u03bb, \u03c4, \u03c3, \u03c0) + U(q, k; \u03bb, \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03c0) +\n\u0010\nasn amr\nU(k, p; \u03c3, \u03bb, \u03c4, \u03c0) \u2212 U(p, k; \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03bb, \u03c0) + U(p, k; \u03c0, \u03c4, \u03bb, \u03c3) \u2212\n+f f\n\n\u2212U(k, p; \u03c0, \u03bb, \u03c4, \u03c3) \u2212 U(l, q; \u03bb, \u03c0, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) + U(l, q; \u03c4, \u03c0, \u03c3, \u03bb) \u2212 U(q, l; \u03c4, \u03c3, \u03c0, \u03bb) +\n\u0011\u0011\n+U(q, l; \u03bb, \u03c3, \u03c0, \u03c4 ) ;\n\n(5)\n\nU(k, l; \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03c0, \u03bb) = k\u03c3 l\u03c4 g\u03c0\u03bb \u2212 k\u03c3 l\u03bb g\u03c0\u03c4 + k\u03c0 l\u03bb g\u03c3\u03c4 \u2212 (kl)g\u03c3\u03c4 g\u03c0\u03bb .\n\nHere a triad p, m, \u03bb etc means correspondingly momentum, colour index, Lorentz index of\nthe gluon.\nLet us formulate compensation equations in this approximation. For free Lagrangian\nL0 full connected three-gluon vertices are to vanish. One can succeed in obtaining analytic\nsolutions for the following set of momentum variables (see Fig. 1): left-hand legs have\nmomenta p and \u2212p, and a right-hand leg has zero momenta. However in our approximation\nwe need form-factor F also for non-zero values of this momentum.

The solution exists only for\nthis value (12) and it plays the role of eigenvalue. As a matter of fact from the beginning\nthe existence of such eigenvalue is by no means evident.\nWe consider the neglected terms of equation (7) as a perturbation to be taken into account\nin forthcoming studies.\nWe use Schwinger-Dyson equation for gluon polarization operator to obtain a contribution\nof additional effective vertex to the running QCD coupling constant \u03b1s . The corresponding diagram is presented at Fig.2. Due to this vertex being gauge invariant, there is no\ncontribution of ghost fields. So the contribution under discussion reads\ngGN\n\u2206\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (x) =\n2 (2 \u03c0)4\n\nZ\n\np\np\nf\n2\n\u03930\u03bc\u03c1\u03c3 (p, \u2212q \u2212 2p , q \u2212 p2 ) \u0393ef\n\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 (\u2212p, q + 2 , \u2212q + 2 ) F (q +\n(q 2 + p2 /4)2 \u2212 (pq)2\n\n3p2\n) dq\n4\n\n.

Integrals of Meijer functions depending on y \u2032 multiplied\nby any power of y \u2032 can be evaluated analytically. In view of this we expand the denominator\nin (22) in series in powers of x/2. Substituting solution (10) into integrals we obtain explicit\nexpressions for each term of expansion of expression (22). Calculations show that results\nwith different numbers of expansion terms begin practically coincide starting from three-term\nexpansion. In what follows we present results with four terms.\nSo we have modified one-loop expression for \u03b1s (p2 )\n\u03b1s (x) =\n\n4 \u03c0 \u03b1s (p20 )\n;\n4 \u03c0 + b0 \u03b1s (p20 ) ln(x/\u039b2 ) + 4 \u03c0\u03a0(x)\n\nx = p2 ;\n\nb0 = 11 \u2212\n\n2 Nf\n.\n3\n\n(23)\n\nIt is remarkable that function \u03a0(x) at x = Y (z = z0 ) turns to be very small, almost\nzero. We just expect this quantity to be zero exactly. So this property of the approximated\npolarization operator indicates the consistency of the procedure being used. Namely we\nnormalize \u03b1s (p2 ) at point p0 , which correspond to our cut-off Y . Coupling constant g entering\nin expressions (16) and (22) is just corresponding to this normalization point. Performing\nthe well-known transformations in expression (23) we have for u < u0\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n4\u03c0\n8 N\u03c0\nY\nx\n\u03b1s (u) =\nln(u) +\nI\n; u0 = 2\n= 14.61328 ;\n; u = 2\nb0\nb0 g\n\u039bQCD\n\u039bQCD\n6\n\n\f\u0014 3/2\n\u0015\n\u221a\nF0 (t)dt\nt\nt\n27 \u221a\n\u221a \u221a\n16\n\u2212 48 \u221a + 45 t \u2212\nI = \u2212\nz +\n\u221a\nz\nz\n2\nz\nt(2\nt\n\u2212\nz)\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ z0 16\n\u221a\n5\u221a\nG2 N x2\nF0 (t)dt\n\u221a \u221a\n\u22123 t +\n; b0 = 9 .\n+\nz ; z=\n\u221a\n2\n1024 \u03c0 2\nt(2 t \u2212 z)\nz\nZ\n\nz\n\n(24)\n\nFor u > u0 we use the perturbative one-loop expression\n\u03b1s (u) =\n\n4\u03c0\n.\nb0 ln(u)\n\n(25)\n\nTwo expressions (25), (24) give equal values \u03b10 for \u03b1s at point z0 , while value \u03b1s (u0 ) (20) is\ndefined by equation (16). The self-consistent result for expressions (24, 25) with account of\nprevious relations is unique and reads as follows\nz0 = 1.915838 ; u0 = 14.61328 ; \u03b10 = 0.5206188 ;\nC1 = 0.06172743 ; C2 = \u2212 0.1640803 .\n\n(26)\n\nBehavior of \u03b1s (24) with u = Q/\u039bQCD is presented at Fig. 3 for \u039bQCD = 0.2 GeV and\n0.05 GeV < Q < 1 GeV . The behaviour with maximum at Q \u2243 0.6 GeV and maximal\nvalue \u03b1smax \u2243 0.55 agrees to calculations in work [7]. Qualitately the result also corresponds\nto lattice calculations in work [8] (see also discussion in paper [9]). Note, that we begin plot\nat Fig.3 starting from p = 0.05 GeV , because \u03b1s (u) has a pole at very small u, which is\nanalogous to the well-known perturbative pole at u = 1. Now this pole is shifted to the far\ninfrared region. One may deal with it using the method proposed in work [10] and subtract\nfrom (24) the following term\n4\u03c0\n;\nb0 D (u \u2212 u00 )\n\nu00 = 0.005769 ;\n\nD = 170.1594 .\n\n(27)\n\nThis procedure practically does not change the result presented at Fig.3 in the denoted\ninterval of Q. For comparison we present the modified \u03b1s (Q) for interval 0.01 GeV < Q <\n1 GeV at Fig 4. Value of \u03b1s (Q) at zero reads \u03b1s (0) = 1.4205.\nAll values are now expressed in terms of \u039bQCD . Emphasize, that there is no additional\nparameters to describe the non-perturbative infrared region.\nFrom definition of variables z, u and x we obtain value of new coupling constant G\nG =\n\n5.497571\n.\n\u039b2QCD\n\n(28)\n\nWe calculate non-perturbative vacuum average of the third power in gluon field, which\nis immediately connected with our results. We have\na\nb\nc\n< g 3 fabc F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03bd\u03c1\nF\u03c1\u03bc\n>=\n\ng 3 G 96 \u03c0 4\nI1 I2 = 110.77 \u039b6QCD ;\n(2\u03c0)8\n7\n\n(29)\n\n\fZ 1\nZ 4\nZ 4\u0010\n3\n3 (1 \u2212 y)2 (1 \u2212 3y/4)\n3y \u0011\n(1 \u2212 y)2\n1\u2212\ndy \u2212\ndy \u2212\ndy =\nI1 =\n4\ny(1 \u2212 y/2)\n0\n1\n0 (1 \u2212 y/2)\nZ Y\n(32 \u03c0)4\n= 0.278756 ; I2 =\nx3 dx F (x) = 0.18062\n.\n2 G4 N 2\n0\nValue (29) seems reasonable. However the accuracy of phenomenological and lattice definitions of this value is not yet satisfactory.\nTo conclude we would state, that method [3] being applied to non-perturbative \u03b1s proves\nits efficiency even in the first approximation, which is considered here. Bearing in mind also\nresults of works [1, 2] on application of the approach to low-energy hadron physics we would\nexpress a hope, that in this way we could obtain the adequate tool to deal non-perturbative\neffects in QCD and, maybe, in other problems.\nThe mean non-perturbative value for \u03b1s turns to be here around 0.5. For this value\nresults of works [1, 2] seem to be quite consistent.\nThe author express his gratitude to D.V. Shirkov for valuable discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] B.A. Arbuzov, Phys. Atom.
