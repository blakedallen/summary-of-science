From a purely pragmatic interpretation of quantum theory this\nexplains why spinor fields are needed to represent particles. The models are based\nentirely on classical general relativity and are motivated by the suggestion that the\nlack of a time-orientation could be the origin of quantum phenomena.\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nSpin half is normally regarded as a non-classical property peculiar to quantum theory.\nObjects with spin-half are represented by spinor fields. The most distinctive, indeed\nthe characteristic, property of a spinor is the way it transforms under a rotation. In\nparticular the fact that a rotation of space coordinates by an angle of 2\u03c0 is not an\nidentity operation whereas a rotation by 4\u03c0 is an identity operation. This work offers\nan explanation of why spinor fields are needed to represent fermions. The explanation\nis based entirely upon classical general relativity.\nMany authors have explored the relation between general relativity and quantum\ntheory, some attempt to apply quantum theory to curved spacetime and non-trivial\nspacetime topologies by adding quantum fields to the underlying manifold. Such an\napproach with spin-half particles requires the manifold to be endowed with a spinor\nfield; Geroch [1] describes the constraints on the topology and orientability of spacetime\nin order to admit a spinor field. This work does not attempt to add or construct a\nspinor field on a curved spacetime. Instead it attempts to explain why we need to use\nspinor fields (on flat spacetime) to model some particles. The constraints imposed by\nGeroch do not apply.\nIn quantum theory, a wavefunction, or quantum field, is used to calculate the\nprobabilistic results of experiments which detect a particle. This is certainly true. To\ngo beyond this pragmatic view requires an interpretation of quantum theory (see for\nexample Ballentine [2] or Isham [3] for a discussion). To regard the wavefunction itself as\nbeing the particle has substantial conceptual and practical problems. But if the particle\nand wavefunction are indeed different, then a model or description of an elementary\nparticle is required. One way of modelling an elementary particle is as a region of spacetime with non-trivial topology - a geon [4, 5] which can be described using classical\ngeneral relativity. The wavefunction would still be the tool for calculating the results\nof experiments but its role would be that of a probability function. It is important to\nkeep in mind this distinction between the particle itself and the quantum fields used to\ncalculate the results of experiments.\nThe complex fields used to represent particles need to have, amongst other\nattributes, the same transformation properties as the particles that they represent.\nParticles with zero spin and spherical symmetry are represented by a complex scalar\nfield. Spin-1 particles with the transformation properties of a vector are represented\nby vector fields. Note that vectors and spinors are defined by their transformation\nproperties under rotations. An elementary particle (or indeed any object) may have the\ntransformation properties of a vector - a pencil is a good approximation. The vector\nwould describe its orientation, and a rotation of either the object or the coordinate\nsystem would be correctly modelled by the vector. By contrast the quantum mechanical\nwavefunction defines a vector (or scalar) at each point in space (a vector field) and\nthe components would be complex numbers - this is what quantum theory requires to\ncompute the probabilistic results of experiments. In a similar way there is a distinction\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n3\n\nbetween a single object having the transformation properties of a spinor and a spinor\nfield which is used by quantum mechanics to represent such an object.\nSome authors have produced artificial models, parts of which, transform as a\nspinor see for example the cube within a cube described by Misner, Thorne and\nWheeler[6] or the tethered rocks of Hartung [7]. This paper shows how an object with\nthe transformation properties of a spinor can be constructed within classical general\nrelativity. The work requires that the topology of spacetime within a fermion is nontrivial and is not time orientable. It would then follow that quantum theory in flat\nspacetime would need to model the dynamics of such a particle using spinor fields.\nThis paper relates to models of elementary particles as regions of spacetime with\nnon-trivial topology. The term geon was used by Misner and Wheeler to describe\nparticle-like structures with non-trivial spatial topology [5]. The idea was later extended\nby Hadley to regions which also had non-trivial causal structure called 4-geons [8]. The\ninvestigation of manifolds which are not time orientable is motivated by the suggestion\nthat models of elementary particles based on such manifolds would give rise to quantum\nmechanical effects [8] and that a reversal of the time orientation is related both to\ntopology change [9] and the measurement process in quantum theory. Therefore, the\nmanifolds being examined have real significance quite apart from their transformation\nunder rotations. The simplest example was described in the paper by Diemer and Hadley\n[10] and shown to display net charge from the source-free Maxwell equations. Hadley's\ngravitational explanation for quantum theory provides additional motivation for this\nwork, but the results of this paper are interesting in their own right and do not depend\nupon the earlier work. The main result is a fascinating consequence of non-trivial causal\nstructure in general relativity.\nHere it is shown that non time orientable manifolds present obstructions which\nprevent a physical (time parameterised) rotation being extended throughout the\nmanifold in a non-trivial way. There must be some exempt points. This topological\nobstruction will, in general, prevent a 2\u03c0 rotation (and any well behaved extension of\nit) from being an identity operation. This property of spinors is intimately related to\nthe fact that the group of rotations, SO(3), is not simply connected. A result which can\nbe seen in the famous scissors model of Dirac and the cube within a cube described by\nMisner, Thorne and Wheeler [6]. A description is given in references [11, 12] and [13]\ncontains a proof.\nFriedman and Sorkin [14] have previously considered other topological obstructions\nwhich prevent a rotational transformation being extended from the region of flat\nspacetime throughout the manifold (ie into the interior of the particle). On some 3manifolds (characterised by Hendricks [15]) it is not possible to define a rotational vector\nfield. In the context of quantum gravity, Friedman and Sorkin impose a wavefunction on\nsuch manifolds and consider the effects of a rotation on the asymptotically flat regions.\nThey conclude that a wavefunction as required by a theory of quantum gravity could\nhave a spinorial character. By contrast; this work invokes a different mechanism, it\napplies to manifolds which have a physical interest for other reasons. Furthermore,\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n4\n\nthese results arise from classical general relativity, they do not invoke any quantum\ntheory of gravity, but they may help to explain quantum phenomena.\n2. Line bundle models of spacetime\nAlthough the analysis requires a clear distinction between time and space directions, the\nresults can be obtained by applying topological arguments to a non-trivial line bundle\nover a 3-manifold - it is not necessary to define a metric explicitly.\nA causal spacetime is modelled by a trivial line-bundle E over a 3-manifold, M,\n\u03c0\nE \u2192 M. The base manifold, M, corresponds to space at t = 0. The evolution is given\nby a diffeomorphism, Q from M \u00d7 R to the line bundle E such that Q(*, 0) is the zero\nsection and (Q(*, t))(M) is the space at a time t. Under a transformation a fixed point\nin space would be mapped to a point on its own fibre. A non-trivial line-bundle over a 3manifold is a convenient topological model of those non-time orientable spacetimes with\nthe property that time is not orientable on any spacelike slice; the manifold described\nby Diemer and Hadley is an example.\nA base 3-manifold endowed with a non-trivial line bundle would correspond to a\nspacetime that is not time orientable. If the line bundle is non-trivial then every section\nhas some zero points. In general, the space of zero points, X, is a 2-dimensional surface.\nIt is this topological property of sections of a non-trivial line bundle which gives rise to\nthe results in this paper. This can be illustrated by considering sections of a m\u00f6bius\nstrip. The base manifold is a circle, S 1 , which corresponds to a circular space - the time\ndirection is everywhere normal to the base circle. Parts of the base manifold can be\nmoved within the M\u00f6bius band, but an attempt to shift the entire circle up or down is\nnot possible - there will be at least one point where the shifted circle crosses the base\ncircle.\n3. Models of particles\nA particle in spacetime is modelled as an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with non-trivial\ntopology and endowed with a line bundle where each fibre corresponds to the timeline\nof a point in space. A non-time-orientable manifold corresponds to a non-trivial line\nbundle.\nThe simplest example due to Diemer and Hadley[10] is RP3 with a point removed\nand endowed with a non-trivial line-bundle. The point removed corresponds to spatial\ninfinity and a sphere S 2 enclosing the point corresponds to a sphere enclosing the\nparticle. With the addition of a Faraday electromagnetic field 2-form, this construction\ncan model a spherically symmetric electric monopole.\nAn alternative construction of the same spacetime manifold is as follows: a ball is\nremoved from space (a cylinder from spacetime) and then joined up by identifying\nopposite points, but reversing the time direction. Externally this is spherically\nsymmetric. The region of non-trivial topology can be surrounded by a sphere, S 2 ,\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n5\n\nsuch that spacetime is topologically trivial and asymptotically flat outside the sphere.\n4. Definitions of rotations\nRotations are well-defined in R3 as elements of SO(3). Every rotation has an axis, \u03b6,\nand is an element of the one parameter subgroup of rotations about this fixed axis.\nRotations, \u03c1\u03b6 (\u03b8), by an angle \u03b8 about an axis \u03b6 are smooth maps from R3 to R3 which\nsatisfy the following conditions:\nDefinition 4.1 (1-parameter subgroup conditions)\n(i) \u03c1\u03b6 (0) = id\n(ii) \u2200\u03b8, \u03c6 \u2208 R \u03c1\u03b6 (\u03b8 + \u03c6) = \u03c1\u03b6 (\u03b8)\u03c1\u03b6 (\u03c6)\n(iii) \u03c1\u03b6 is a smooth function\nIn the following the subscript \u03b6 will be omitted for clarity.\nWe need to extend the usual definition so that it applies to manifolds with a nontrivial topology and to manifolds which are not time-orientable. For physical reasons we\nrestrict attention to asymptotically flat manifolds, and in the asymptotically flat region\nwe require correspondence with rotations defined in R3 .\nDefinition 4.2 (A Rotation on an Asymptotically Flat Manifold) A rotation,\nR(\u03b8), by an angle \u03b8, on an Asymptotically Flat Manifold, M, is an element of a 1parameter subgroup of diffeomorphisms from M to itself which satisfies the conditions\n4.1 above and \u2200\u03b8 \u2208 R converges to a rotation, \u03c1\u03b6 (\u03b8), in R3 for large x:\ndist(\u03c1\u03b6 (\u03b8)x, R(\u03b8)x) \u2192 0\n\nas\n\n|x| \u2192 \u221e\n\n(1)\n\nThe definition is very wide, the form of the transformation is only tightly prescribed\nin the asymptotic regions. In particular R(\u03b8) is not an isometry, it is any smooth\nextension of the familiar form of a rotation.\nRemark 4.3 A rotation always exists - consider two concentric spheres Sa2 and Sb2\nwhere Sb2 encloses Sa2 which in turn encloses the region of non-trivial topology:\n\uf8f1\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 id = R(0) inside Sa\nR(\u03b8) =\n(2)\n\u03c1(\u03b8)\noutside Sb2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c1(f (r)\u03b8) in between\n\nwhere f (r) is any smooth function of r such that f (r) = 0 when r = ra and f (r) = 1\nwhen r = rb .\n\nRemark 4.4 Rotations are not uniquely defined by definition 4.2. Any smooth function\nf (r) with the properties above can be used to construct a rotation R(\u03b8) which satisfies\n4.2 and has the same asymptotic form.\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n6\n\nA rotation is an element of a 1-parameter subgroup of diffeomorphisms acting\non M. The rotation and the subgroup define a path in M from x to R(\u03b8)x:\n\u03b3\u03b8 (\u03bb) = {R(\u03bb\u03b8)x|x \u2208 M, \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]}, This definition has no notion of time. The\nparameter, \u03bb has no physical significance, the rotation is not an operation that can be\nphysically implemented. Of specific concern in this paper is the notion of a physical\nrotation - a rotation which defines a worldline parameterised by time. This gives an\noperation that is physically relevant, an object or a 3-manifold can be transformed from\nan initial state at t = 0 to a rotated state at a later time t = 1:\nDefinition 4.5 (Physical Rotation on a time-orientable manifold) A physical rotation, R(\u03b8) on a time-orientable manifold is a map from M, identified with the zero\nsection, to the image of the unit section of the line bundle:\nR(\u03b8)(x, 0) \u2192 (R(\u03b8)x, 1)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere R(\u03b8) also satisfies the 1-parameter subgroup conditions 4.1. The projection of\na physical rotation onto the base manifold gives a rotation of an asymptotically flat\nmanifold defined earlier:\n\u03c0 \u25e6 R(\u03b8) = R(\u03b8)\n\n(4)\n\nA physical rotation and its subgroup define a curve in the line bundle E from (x, 0)\nto (R(\u03b8)x, 1), \u03c7\u03b8 (t) = {(R(t\u03b8)x, t)|x \u2208 M, t \u2208 [0, 1]}, which is the worldline of each\npoint x \u2208 M. The projection of the worldline is equal to the path in M defined earlier:\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c7\u03b8 (t) = \u03b3\u03b8 (t). Although a physical rotation is conceptually different, there is a one\nto one correspondence between physical rotations and rotations of an asymptotically\nflat manifold defined earlier. Similarly the curves, \u03b3\u03b8 (\u03bb), and world lines, \u03c7\u03b8 (t) are in\none to one correspondence.\nHowever definition 4.5 cannot be applied to a spacetime which is not time orientable\n(a non-trivial line bundle) because it assumes the existence of a nowhere vanishing\nsection (the unit section) which implies that a global trivialisation of the line bundle\nexists. We refine definition 4.5 so that it applies to any asymptotically flat manifold\nincluding those which are not time orientable. The definition requires the replacement\non the unit section of the line bundle by another section \u03c6 :\nDefinition 4.6 (Physical Rotation) A physical rotation, R(\u03b8) is a map from M,\nidentified with the zero section, to the image of a section \u03c6 of the line bundle:\nR(\u03b8)(x, 0)\n\n\u2192 (R(\u03b8)x, \u03c6(x))\n\n(5)\n\nwhen \u03c6(x) = 0\n\nR(\u03b8)x = x \u2200\u03b8\n\n(6)\n\nas |x| \u2192 \u221e\n\n\u03c6(x) \u2192 1\n\n(7)\n\nClearly a physical rotation exists and is not unique. Equation 4 is still valid but\nthere is no longer a one to one correspondence between physical rotations and rotations\nof an asymptotically flat manifold due to equation 6.\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n7\n\nThis definition is obviously of physical relevance. A real rotation in the laboratory\nis well-defined in an almost flat region of spacetime. The internal structure of a particle\nis unknown and the structure of spacetime within a particle is also unknown. This\ndefinition places few constraints on the internal structure of a particle and accommodates\nboth a spacetime with non-trivial topology as well as the existence of extraneous fields\non a flat spacetime.\nIn general a Physical Rotation is not an isometry, it does not preserve distances\nexcept in the asymptotic region. It is defined as a general extension of a rotation from\nthe asymptotic region to the whole manifold. An isometric extension would not normally\nbe possible. An analogy would be a large rubber disk, fixed in the middle with two or\nmore nails. The outer rim could be rotated, near the outer rim the rotation would be\nan isometry. The transformation created by rotating the rim, can be extended to the\nwhole disk, but it is not an isometry throughout the disk.\nThis construction agrees with the normal definition of a rotation in the\nasymptotically flat region, it can be extended to the whole of a time orientable manifold\nwith \u03c6(x) = 1\u2200x. It can also be extended to the whole manifold even when it is not\ntime orientable, but for some points \u03c6(x) = 0. Definition 4.6 and equation 6 distinguish\ntwo types of fixed points under a rotation.\nDefinition 4.7 (fixed point) x is a fixed point of the rotation if R(\u03b8)(x, 0) \u2192\n(x, \u03c6(x))\nThese points correspond to the axes of a rotation. But there are also exempt points:\nDefinition 4.8 (exempt point) x is an exempt point of the rotation if R(\u03b8)(x, 0) \u2192\n(x, 0)\nWe denote by X the set of all exempt points. The name exempt conforms to the\ndefinition of Hartung[7], where he considers the rotation of a tethered object, the object\nrotates but the other end of the tether is an exempt point in the sense of being a point\nto which the rotation is not applied.\nAs already pointed out, rotations are not uniquely specified by this definition.\nThe rotation is tightly defined in the asymptotic region where it maps (x, 0) \u2192\n(R(\u03b8)x, \u03c6(x)) \u2248 (\u03c1(x), 1), but there are many ways of extending the section of the\nline bundle and many ways of extending the rotation transformation. Consequently\nthe exempt points are not determined by the rotation in the asymptotic region, but\ndepend upon the way in which the section is extended. On a manifold which is not\ntime-orientable, time is not orientable around at least one class of non-contractable\nclosed curves in M and therefore every such curve must have at least one exempt point.\nConsequently, the space of exempt points is at least two dimensional (otherwise a small\ndistortion of the curve could be made which would not have an exempt point) and the\nproof in [13] applies.\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n8\n\n5. Spin-half\nThe following results apply to the specific particle model described above and also to the\nmore general case where the particle is a region of spacetime with non-trivial topology\nsurrounded by a world tube S 2 \u00d7R such that any region spanning the S 2 does not admit\na time orientation. This is sufficient to ensure that any section of the line bundle has\nexempt points.\nThe fact that the exempt points form a 2-dimensional surface ensures that this\nmodel is analogous to the tethered rocks of Hartung [7] and the scissors trick of Dirac\n[11]. It follows that a 2\u03c0 rotation cannot be an identity operation but 4\u03c0 rotation can\nbe:\n\u2200R(0)\n\n(x, 0) \u2192 (x, \u03c6(x))\n\n(8)\n\n\u2200R(2\u03c0) \u2203x st : (x, 0) \u2192 (R(2\u03c0)x, \u03c6(x)) 6= (x, \u03c6(x))\n\n(9)\n\n\u2203R(4\u03c0) st : \u2200x (x, 0) \u2192 (R(4\u03c0)x, \u03c6(x)) = (x, \u03c6(x))\n\n(10)\n\nIt follows that R(0), the identity transformation, is diffeomorphic to R(4\u03c0) relative\nto {X, S 2 } and that R(2\u03c0) is not. This is also a necessary, but not sufficient condition,\nfor R(4\u03c0) to be an isometry and for R(2\u03c0) not to be an isometry. A 2\u03c0 rotation could\nbe an isometry if the particle had an internal symmetry - which is not possessed by the\nsimple monopole example.\nThis gives a physical explanation of why it is appropriate to model a fermion\nas a tethered object. This model, with non-trivial causal structure, was originally\nconstructed to explain how the effects of quantum theory could arise within classical\ngeneral relativity. The spin half effects (and also the appearance of electric charge [10])\nare simply a consequence of using general relativity to explain quantum effects.\n6. Conclusion\nOn the relation to quantum theory, we take a pragmatic view of quantum theory that it\nis a scheme for predicting the probabilistic distribution of the outcomes of measurements.\nIt is clear that a particle must be represented by a mathematical object with the\nappropriate transformation properties under rotations. The particle modelled here has\nthe transformation properties of a spinor, so any field theory which attempts to model\nthe behaviour under rotations will necessarily use spinor fields.\nThis approach contrasts with that of Sorkin, who considered a wavefunction\nimposed upon a non-trivial manifold. That would be meaningless when the constructions\ngiven can display quantum mechanical effects by themselves. Here the wavefunction is\ndefined in R4 and is a means of mapping the evolution of non-trivial causal structure\nonto a conventional spacetime.\nThe previous sections modelled a single free particle. Hartung extends the idea of a\ntethered rock to two or more tethered rocks and concludes that an exchange of particles\nis equivalent to a 2\u03c0 rotation of one of the particles. However his analysis assumes that\n\n\fSpin half in classical general relativity\n\n9\n\ntwo tethered rocks is equivalent to a pair of rocks tethered to each other. With the\nmodel presented here, such an equivalence is not apparent.\nIn general relativity, the non-gravitational energy, momentum and angular\nmomentum can be derived from the energy momentum tensor which is defined at every\npoint of spacetime. However the contribution of the gravitational field itself to the total\nenergy, momentum and angular momentum cannot be defined locally and hence the\ntotal values cannot be defined locally (see for example [6]). Well defined global values\nexist in asymptotically flat manifolds such as the one described here. This example has\na total angular momentum of zero. The asymptotic form of the metric is independent of\nthe time orientability. This must be the case because a non-zero value would give a welldefined spin direction independently of measurement which is contrary both to quantum\ntheory and experiment. Indeed a zero angular momentum for an unpolarised electron\nis just what one would expect from the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nIn conclusion, the transformation properties of fermions have been modelled using\nclassical general relativity. A 4-geon model of a particle, originally constructed to explain\nquantum effects, is shown to exhibit spin-half transformation properties. The wellknown fact that fermions transform like tethered objects is therefore explained with an\nestablished classical theory - general relativity. It is particularly significant that the\nexplanation arises naturally, indeed almost inevitably, as a consequence of the proposed\ngravitational explanation of quantum mechanics [8, 9].\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to Dr M Micallef (Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick) for\nvaluable discussions and many helpful suggestions.\nReferences\n[1] Geroch R 1968 J.
