We prove that for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, p 6= 2, the Lp spaces associated\nto two von Neumann algebras M, N are isometrically isomorphic if and only\nif M and N are Jordan *-isomorphic. This follows from a noncommutative\nLp Banach-Stone theorem: a specific decomposition for surjective isometries\nof noncommutative Lp spaces.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. Let M and N be von Neumann algebras, and 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, p 6= 2.\nThe following are equivalent:\n(1) M and N are Jordan *-isomorphic;\n(2) Lp (M) and Lp (N ) are isometrically isomorphic as Banach spaces.\nL\u221e (M) is to be understood as M itself, so for p = \u221e the statement follows\nfrom the classic article of Kadison [14] (see Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 below). One may\nview this paper as an Lp version of Kadison's results.\nThe implication (1) \u2192 (2) is a direct application of modular theory and interpolation, only requiring us to go a little further down well-traveled paths. The\nmore interesting part is to show that (2) \u2192 (1). In case the surjective isometry is\n*-preserving and the algebras are \u03c3-finite, this was proved by Watanabe [32]. When\nboth algebras are semifinite, this follows from a structure theorem for Lp isometries (even non-surjective) due to Yeadon [37], [28]; recently Yeadon's theorem was\nextended in [13] to classify isometries for which only the initial algebra is assumed\nsemifinite. In common with these papers, our proof relies crucially on the equality\ncondition in the noncommutative Clarkson inequality. But we do not make use of\nany of these papers' results, and type considerations play no role in our argument\n(although abelian summands require a little extra care). We actually determine\nthe structure of the surjective isometry, as follows.\nTheorem 1.2. (Noncommutative Lp Banach-Stone theorem)\nLet T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (N ) be a surjective isometry, where M and N are von Neumann algebras and 1 < p < \u221e, p 6= 2. Then there are a surjective Jordan *isomorphism J : M \u2192 N and a unitary w \u2208 N such that\n(1.1)\n\nT (\u03c61/p ) = w(\u03c6 \u25e6 J \u22121 )1/p ,\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 M+\n\u2217.\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary: 46L52; Secondary: 46B04, 46L10.\nKey words and phrases. von Neumann algebra, noncommutative Lp space, isometry, Jordan\nisomorphism.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAVID SHERMAN\n\nHere \u03c61/p is the generic positive element of Lp (M); we will explain this notation.\nSince any Lp element is a linear combination of four positive ones, (1.1) completely\ndetermines T . The extensions to 0 < p \u2264 1 of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are true but\nnot proved in this paper - see Remark 2 of Section 5, and [26].\nA version of Theorem 1.2 was shown by Watanabe [35] under the assumptions\nthat T is *-preserving and M has a certain extension property. Our method here\nis different: we focus on the subspaces q1 Lp (M)q2 , where q1 , q2 are projections in\nM. These subspaces, called corners, are a sort of \"two-dimensional\" analogue of\nthe projection bands in classical Lp spaces. It turns out that T takes corners to\ncorners, preserving both orthogonality (in the sense defined below) and the semiinner product. From this we deduce the existence of an orthoisomorphism between\nthe projection lattices of M and N . Extending the orthoisomorphism produces a\nJordan *-isomorphism, and an intertwining relation finally implies that T has the\nform (1.1).\nTheorem 1.2 evidently suggests the larger challenge of classifying all Lp isometries. While this is still open in general, we mention that the author has recently\nwritten an article [25] which obtains several new results, including a solution which\nis valid under a mild (perhaps vacuous?) hypothesis on the initial algebra. Also the\npaper [13] completely determines the structure of 2-isometries between Lp spaces.\nAlthough there is some overlap in the setup of these problems, we believe that\nthe surjective case merits a separate exposition, being of independent interest and\nadmitting a distinct technique and solution. There is no overlap at all - in fact,\nan interesting contrast - with the investigation [9] into non-isometric embeddings\nbetween noncommutative Lp spaces.\n2. Background\nWe start with some notation. The only algebras (denoted M, N ) under consideration in this paper are von Neumann algebras. We will use Z for \"center of\" and\nP for \"projections of\", so for example P(Z(M)) is the set of central projections\nof M. With \u03c6 \u2208 M\u2217 , x \u2208 M, x\u03c6 (resp. \u03c6x) means the functional \u03c6(* x) (resp.\n\u03c6(x *)). We use sl , sr to mean \"left/right support of\", for operators, functionals,\nor Lp vectors. Often we simply write Lp to indicate a generic noncommutative Lp\nspace.\nA Jordan homomorphism between von Neumann algebras is a linear map which\npreserves the Jordan operator product (x, y) 7\u2192 (1/2)(xy + yx). Possible adjectives\ninclude normal, *-preserving, injective, surjective... a Jordan homomorphism which\nis all of these is a surjective Jordan *-isomorphism. (Normality is a consequence\n[10, Paragraph 4.5.6].) That being said, all of the Jordan theory that the reader\nneeds for this paper is contained in Kadison's\nTheorem 2.1. [14, Theorem 10] A surjective Jordan *-isomorphism between von\nNeumann algebras is the direct sum of a *-isomorphism and a *-antiisomorphism.\nUp to multiplication by a unitary, these are all the surjective isometries between\nvon Neumann algebras.\nTheorem 2.2. [14, Theorem 7] Let T be a surjective isometry between the von\nNeumann algebras M and N . Then there are a surjective Jordan *-isomorphism\nJ from M to N and a unitary w \u2208 N such that T (x) = wJ(x) for all x \u2208 M.\n\n\fNONCOMMUTATIVE Lp\n\n3\n\nActually Kadison proved both of these theorems for all unital C*-algebras. Since\nisometries of abelian unital C*-algebras are described by the Banach-Stone theorem,\nTheorem 2.2 is considered a noncommutative Banach-Stone theorem. The reader\nwill note its similarity with Theorem 1.2. But Kadison's proof of Theorem 2.2, and\nothers offered later, rely on the geometry (i.e. extreme points, faces) of the unit\nball. It does not seem that they can be adapted to work in the Lp context.\nWe will assume a basic familiarity with noncommutative Lp spaces. Still, it\nseems wise to review briefly the specific constructions and concepts that we need.\nWe provide selective, but hopefully sufficient, references to the literature. The\nreader desiring more overview might consult [22], which focuses on Banach space\nproperties and also includes a rich bibliography.\nIn keeping with the motto \"von Neumann algebras are noncommutative L\u221e\nspaces\", one thinks of von Neumann preduals as noncommutative L1 spaces and\ncan consider how to construct their Lp cousins. When M is a semifinite algebra\nwith faithful normal semifinite tracial weight \u03c4 , one may simply employ \u03c4 as an\nintegral. That is, Lp (M, \u03c4 ) is the closure of {T \u2208 M | kT kp , \u03c4 (|T |p )1/p < \u221e}\nin the norm k * kp . This construction goes back to Segal [24] and has a pleasing\ninterpretation as a set of (possibly unbounded) operators. See [20].\nBut it does not work for all von Neumann algebras. The first general construction\nis due to Haagerup [8], who saw that M\u2217 could be identified, as an ordered vector\nspace, with a class of unbounded operators affiliated with the core of M. Since\nthese are operators, one can take pth roots on the positive cone, and the norm can\nbe imported from M\u2217 . To be specific, Lp (M) is the set of \u03c4 -measurable operators\naffiliated with (M \u22ca\u03c3 R, \u03c4 ) which satisfy \u03b8s (T ) = e\u2212s/p T . Here \u03c3 is a modular\naction, \u03c4 is the canonical trace, and \u03b8 is the dual action. Notice that the product\nof an Lp operator and an Lq operator is an Lr operator, where p1 + 1q = r1 . See [30].\nIn this construction, any positive element in Lp (M) is the pth root of an operator\n1/p\nwhich corresponds to some \u03c6 \u2208 M+\n. Notice\n\u2217 . We will refer to this element as \u03c6\n1/p\n1/p\nthat k\u03c6 k = [\u03c6(1)] . This notation frequently proves expedient and is discussed\nspecifically in [36], [3, Section V.B.\u03b1], [27].\nThe polar decomposition and M \u2212 M bimodule structure for L1 (M) agree with\nthose of M\u2217 . In particular, the partial isometry and support projections are in M,\nand all support projections are necessarily \u03c3-finite. This second statement remains\ntrue for Lp (M), but the bimodule structure is less obvious. See [30], [12].\nAnother construction of Lp (M) is by complex interpolation, pioneered by Kosaki\n[16]. Assume that M is \u03c3-finite, and consider the left embedding of M in M\u2217\narising from a fixed faithful state \u03c6 \u2208 M\u2217 : x 7\u2192 x\u03c6. Then Haagerup's space\nLp (M) is isometric to the interpolated Banach space at 1/p [16, Theorem 9.1].\nMore precisely, we have\n(2.1)\n\nLp (M) \u2243 [M, M\u2217 ]1/p = Lp (M)\u03c61/q ,\n\n1/p + 1/q = 1.\n\nHere the equality is meant as sets, while the isomorphism is an isometric identification of Banach spaces. Right embeddings of the form x 7\u2192 \u03c6x (and even others)\nwork equally well.\nEvaluation at 1 (i.e., \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6(1)) is a distinguished linear functional on M\u2217 \u2243\nL1 (M). It is called the Haagerup trace, and denoted Tr, because it implements the\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID SHERMAN\n\nduality between Lp and Lq (1/p + 1/q = 1) in a trace-like way:\n< \u03be, \u03b7 >= Tr(\u03be\u03b7) = Tr(\u03b7\u03be),\n\n\u03be \u2208 Lp (M), \u03b7 \u2208 Lq (M).\n\nUnder this pairing each of Lp (M) and Lq (M) can be isometrically identified with\nthe dual space of the other, and of course L\u221e (M) = M is the dual space of L1 (M)\n[30].\nThe most important Lp result for this paper is the noncommutative Clarkson\ninequality, or more accurately the condition characterizing when it is an equality.\nYeadon [37] showed this for semifinite von Neumann algebras; a few years later\nKosaki [17] proved it for arbitrary von Neumann algebras with 2 < p < \u221e; and\nonly recently Raynaud and Xu [23] obtained a general version (relying on Kosaki's\nwork).\nTheorem 2.3. (Equality condition for noncommutative Clarkson inequality)\nFor \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 Lp , 0 < p < \u221e, p 6= 2,\n(2.2)\n\nk\u03be + \u03b7kp + k\u03be \u2212 \u03b7kp = 2(k\u03bekp + k\u03b7kp ) \u21d0\u21d2 \u03be\u03b7 \u2217 = \u03be \u2217 \u03b7 = 0.\n\nThe second condition is equivalent to requiring sr (\u03be)sr (\u03b7) = sl (\u03be)sl (\u03b7) = 0.\nBecause of this, we call pairs of Lp vectors satisfying (2.2) orthogonal. Since the\nfirst condition of (2.2) is preserved by isometries, orthogonality is preserved too.\n(For classical Lp spaces, this says that isometries preserve disjointness of support.\nBanach made this observation in the very first investigation of Lp isometries [1].)\nTo keep things clear, this is the only usage of the term \"orthogonal\" in this paper,\nexcept where we refer specifically to orthogonality of projections. We do not use\n\"orthogonal\" to describe pairs of vectors with semi-inner product zero. So for a set\nS \u2282 Lp , the orthocomplement S \u22a5 means the set of elements orthogonal (in this\nsense) to every element in S.\nSome authors use \"disjoint\" in place of \"orthogonal\". We reserve this term for\nanother use: two subspaces are called disjoint if their intersection is {0}.\n3. Corners and semi-inner products\nIt will be helpful to introduce some ad hoc terminology: a subspace of Lp is a\ncorner if it is of the form q1 Lp q2 for some projections q1 , q2 . Corners with q1 = 1\n(resp. q2 = 1) will be called columns (resp. rows). Note that a corner has a unique\nrepresentation in which q1 , q2 have equal central support; by the central support of a\ncorner we mean the central support of the projections in such a representation. We\nalso refer to either Mz or Lp (M)z as a central summand when z \u2208 P(Z(M)).\nLemma 3.1.\n(1) If T is a surjective isometry between Lp spaces ( 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, p 6= 2) and S\nis a subset of the domain, then T (S \u22a5 ) = T (S)\u22a5 .\n(2) The intersection of any collection of corners is a corner.\n(3) For any set S \u2282 Lp , S \u22a5 is a corner.\nProof. T and T \u22121 preserve orthogonality, proving the first statement. For the\nsecond, let {p\u03b1 }, {q\u03b1 } be sets of projections; then\n\\\np\u03b1 Lp q\u03b1 = (\u2227p\u03b1 )Lp (\u2227q\u03b1 ).\n\n\fNONCOMMUTATIVE Lp\n\n5\n\nThe third follows from noting that {\u03be}\u22a5 = (1 \u2212 sl (\u03be))Lp (1 \u2212 sr (\u03be)) and applying\nthe second to the expression\n\\\nS\u22a5 =\n{\u03be}\u22a5 . \u0003\n\u03be\u2208S\n\nThe other notion we need is that of a semi-inner product, first defined for\ngeneral Banach spaces by Lumer [19]. We will specialize our discussion to Lp\nspaces, 1 < p < \u221e. A nice development of the relationship between isometries and\nsemi-inner products can be found in [7, Section 1.4].\nFor \u03b7 \u2208 Lp , define \u03c6\u03b7 to be the unique functional in (Lp )\u2217 with k\u03c6\u03b7 k = k\u03b7k and\n\u03c6\u03b7 (\u03b7) = k\u03b7k2 . The assignment \u03b7 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 is known as a duality map; uniqueness of\nthe duality map is expressed by saying that Lp is a smooth Banach space. We have\nthat \u03c60 = 0 and otherwise\n(3.1)\n\n\u03c6\u03b7 (*) =\n\nTr(* |\u03b7|p\u22121 v \u2217 )\n,\nk\u03b7kp\u22122\n\nwhere \u03b7 has polar decomposition v|\u03b7|. The semi-inner product is the function on\nLp \u00d7 Lp defined by\n(3.2)\n\n[\u03be, \u03b7] , \u03c6\u03b7 (\u03be),\n\n\u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 Lp .\n\nIn general the semi-inner product is not additive in the second variable.\nWe prepare two lemmas for later use. The first is a small variation of well-known\nresults and surely appears in the literature somewhere. See [15] for the historical\npredecessor or [13, Lemma 4.2] for a similar application.\nLemma 3.2. If T is an isometry between Lp spaces ( 1 < p < \u221e), then T preserves\nthe semi-inner product.\nProof. Note that we are not assuming that T is surjective, so that T \u2217 is only\ncontractive. We first take any Lp vector \u03be and calculate\nT \u2217 (\u03c6T \u03be )(\u03be) = \u03c6T \u03be (T \u03be) = [T \u03be, T \u03be] = kT \u03bek2 = k\u03c6T \u03be kk\u03bek \u2265 kT \u2217(\u03c6T \u03be )kk\u03bek,\nso by smoothness T \u2217 (\u03c6T \u03be ) = \u03c6\u03be . Now we apply this to any two Lp vectors \u03be, \u03b7:\n[T \u03be, T \u03b7] = \u03c6T \u03b7 (T \u03be) = T \u2217 (\u03c6T \u03b7 )(\u03be) = \u03c6\u03b7 (\u03be) = [\u03be, \u03b7]. \u0003\nLemma 3.3. Let 1 < p < \u221e, and let p1 Lp p2 and q1 Lp q2 be corners such that\n(3.3)\n\n[\u03be, \u03b7] = 0,\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 p1 Lp p2 , \u2200\u03b7 \u2208 q1 Lp q2 .\n\nThen p1 q1 and p2 q2 are centrally orthogonal.\nProof. Using (3.1), (3.3) is equivalent to\nTr(p1 \u03bep2 q2 \u03b6q1 ) = 0,\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 Lp , \u2200\u03b6 \u2208 Lq ,\n\n1 1\n+ = 1.\np q\n\nBy duality we may conclude that q1 p1 \u03bep2 q2 = 0 for any \u03be \u2208 Lp . Since the central\nsupports of q1 p1 and (q1 p1 )\u2217 = p1 q1 are equal, this implies the lemma.\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nDAVID SHERMAN\n\n4. Proof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2\nLet us start with the implication (1) \u2192 (2) of Theorem 1.1. The case p = \u221e is\nautomatic; Theorem 2.1 shows that a surjective Jordan *-isomorphism is isometric.\nThe case p = 1 follows by considering the preadjoint of the (normal) surjective\nJordan *-isomorphism. We now assume 1 < p < \u221e, p 6= 2, and the existence of a\nsurjective Jordan *-isomorphism J : M \u2192 N .\nBy Theorem 2.1, there is a central projection z \u2208 M such that xz 7\u2192 J(x)J(z)\nis a surjective *-isomorphism from zM to J(z)N , and x(1 \u2212 z) 7\u2192 J(x)J(1 \u2212 z)\nis a surjective *-antiisomorphism from (1 \u2212 z)M to J(1 \u2212 z)N . Since Lp (M) is\nisometric to Lp (zM)\u2295p Lp ((1 \u2212 z)M) (and similarly for N ), it suffices to show that\n*-isomorphic or *-antiisomorphic von Neumann algebras have isometric Lp spaces.\nAt least the *-isomorphic case is known. In fact the core of a von Neumann\nalgebra, so also its Lp spaces, can be constructed functorially (see, for example, [6,\nTheorem 3.5]). Here we cover the *-antiisomorphic case only; the reader will have\nno trouble making the necessary changes for a *-isomorphism. A related discussion\nis in [33, Section 3], although some statements were later corrected in [34, Section\n3].\nSo let \u03b1 : M \u2192 N be a surjective *-antiisomorphism. (This does not imply\nthat there exists a surjective *-isomorphism, by a paper of Connes [2].) We want\nto construct a surjective isometry from Lp (M) to Lp (N ).\nTemporarily assume that the algebras are \u03c3-finite, and fix a faithful state \u03c6 \u2208\np\np\nM+\n\u2217 . We know that L (M) \u2243 [M, M\u2217 ]1/p and L (N ) \u2243 [N , N\u2217 ]1/p , where we use\nthe embeddings\n\u03b9\n\n1\nx\u03c6 \u2208 M\u2217 ,\nM \u220b x 7\u2192\n\n\u03b9\n\n2\n(\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )y \u2208 N\u2217 .\nN \u220b y 7\u2192\n\nThen the following diagram commutes, and\nlinear isomorphisms.\n\u03b1\nM \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03b91 y\n\nthe horizontal arrows are isometric\nN\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03b92\ny\n\nM\u2217 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N\u2217\n(\u03b1\u22121 )\u2217\n\nIt follows that the interpolated spaces are isometrically isomorphic, and the \u03c3finite case is settled. One might handle the non-\u03c3-finite case by interpolating with\na faithful (normal semifinite) weight. The first Lp construction along these lines is\n[31]; [11] marshals even more technical machinery to recover the analogues of the\nleft and right embeddings above. We will go in a different direction.\nIf we look at the equality (2.1), we see that x\u03c61/p \u2208 Lp (M) is being identified in\nM\u2217 with x\u03c6. This corresponds to (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )\u03b1(x) \u2208 N\u2217 , which gives the Lp element\n(\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )1/p \u03b1(x). So the isometry is densely defined by\nx\u03c61/p 7\u2192 (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )1/p \u03b1(x),\n\nx \u2208 M.\n\nActually, this map is independent of the choice of \u03c6. We have that\n(4.1)\n\nx\u03c61/p = y\u03c8 1/p \u21d2 (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )1/p \u03b1(x) = (\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )1/p \u03b1(y),\n\nusing the cocycle identity\n(4.2)\n\n(D(\u03c8 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) : D(\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ))t = \u03b1((D\u03c6 : D\u03c8)\u2212t ).\n\n\fNONCOMMUTATIVE Lp\n\n7\n\nEquations (4.1) and (4.2) are checked explicitly in [25, Section 6], based on [29,\nCorollary VIII.1.4 and Theorem VIII.3.3]. But this is not yet enough to conclude\nthat the isometries associated to \u03c6 and \u03c8 are equal, as the subspace M\u03c61/p \u2229M\u03c8 1/p\nmay not be dense in Lp (M). (See [18] for a discussion of non-density when p = 2.)\nHowever, given faithful states \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 M\u2217 , we may use functional calculus to define\nthe auxiliary state\n(\u03c62/p + \u03c8 2/p )p/2\n.\nL1 (M) \u220b \u03c1 =\nk(\u03c62/p + \u03c8 2/p )p/2 k1\nFrom the \u03c4 -measurable operator inequality \u03c62/p \u2264 C\u03c12/p , it follows that \u03c61/p =\nx\u03c11/p for some x \u2208 M. This means that M\u03c61/p \u2229 M\u03c11/p = M\u03c61/p , which is dense\nin Lp (M). Then (4.1) shows that \u03c6 and \u03c1 generate the same isometry. But \u03c8 and\n\u03c1 generate the same isometry too, so in the end we can identify the isometries from\n\u03c6 and \u03c8. Some of the details of this argument are given in [12, Section 1], [27], and\nalso generalized in [25, Section 6].\nLet us call this Lp isometry \u03b1p . The independence of \u03b1p from any choice of\nfunctional implies that\n(4.3)\n\n\u03b1p (\u03c61/p ) = (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )1/p ,\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 M\u2217 .\n\nThis can actually be taken as a definition for \u03b1p , since every element in Lp (M) is\na linear combination of four positive ones. Notice also that \u03b1p (x\u03be) = \u03b1p (\u03be)\u03b1(x).\nEquation (4.3) tells us that \u03b1p is positive (thus *-preserving), so we can improve\nthis to\n(4.4)\n\n\u03b1p (x\u03bey) = \u03b1(y)\u03b1p (\u03be)\u03b1(x),\n\n\u03be \u2208 Lp (M), x, y \u2208 M.\n\nNow for any \u03c3-finite q \u2208 P(M), we can construct a surjective isometry from\nqLp (M)q to \u03b1(q)Lp (N )\u03b1(q) as above. Every finite set of vectors in Lp (M) belongs\nto some such qLp (M)q, as the left and right supports of each vector belong to\nthe lattice of \u03c3-finite projections. Furthermore, these isometries can be defined by\n(4.3), so they agree on common domains. It follows that (4.3) defines a global Lp\nisometry in the non-\u03c3-finite case as well.\nThis ends the proof of (1) \u2192 (2). More discussion of Lp isometries constructed\nby interpolation, involving conditional expectations or more general projections,\ncan be found in [25, Sections 6 and 7].\nWe now turn to the implication (2) \u2192 (1) of Theorem 1.1. When p = \u221e, this\nfollows from Theorem 2.2. In case p = 1, the adjoint of a surjective isometry is\nagain a surjective isometry, and we may appeal to the preceding statement. The\nimplication for the remaining values of p is an obvious consequence of Theorem 1.2,\nwhich we prove in the remainder of this section. Assume that T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (N )\nis a surjective isometry of Banach spaces, with 1 < p < \u221e, p 6= 2.\nLemma 4.1. If z \u2208 P(Z(M)), then\n(4.5)\n\nT (zLp (M)) = z \u2032 Lp (N ) for some z \u2032 \u2208 P(Z(N )).\n\nThe map z 7\u2192 z \u2032 induces a surjective *-isomorphism from Z(M) to Z(N ).\nProof. The corners zLp (M) and (1\u2212z)Lp (M) are orthocomplements of each other,\nso by Lemma 3.1(1) their images are orthocomplements of each other. Then Lemma\n3.1(3) tells us there are q, r, s, t \u2208 P(N ) with\n(4.6)\n\nT (zLp(M)) = qLp (N )r,\n\nT ((1 \u2212 z)Lp (M)) = sLp (N )t.\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID SHERMAN\n\nWe may assume that the central supports of q and r are equal, and of s and t are\nequal. From (4.6) it follows that each vector in Lp (N ) can be uniquely written as\nthe sum of two orthogonal vectors, one from each of qLp (N )r and sLp (N )t. As\nprojections, q, s are orthogonal, and r, t are orthogonal. The conclusion (4.5) will\nfollow if we can show that q and t are centrally orthogonal projections, for then the\nspanning property just mentioned implies that all four projections are central.\nIf q and t are not centrally orthogonal, we can find 0 6= \u03be \u2208 qLp (N )t. Write the\ndecomposition as \u03be = \u03be1 + \u03be2 , and note that neither of \u03be1 , \u03be2 can be zero. Now the\nleft support of a sum of orthogonal vectors is the sum of the left supports, just as\nit is for operators. So sl (\u03be) \u0002 q, which is a contradiction.\nSince T \u22121 also satisfies (4.5), the correspondence z \u2194 z \u2032 is bijective. It is additive\non orthogonal elements and so induces a surjective *-isomorphism.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.1 is related to [12, Proposition 6.2]. In the sequel we use the apostrophe\nto indicate the correspondence z \u2194 z \u2032 without further mention.\nLemma 4.2. Let a \u2208 P(Z(M)) be such that aM is the abelian summand of M.\nThen a\u2032 N is the abelian summand of N .\nProof. We first argue that a\u2032 N is abelian. If if is not, let q be a noncentral projection\nin a\u2032 N . Since qLp (N )q = [(1 \u2212 q)Lp (N )(1 \u2212 q)]\u22a5 , we have by Lemma 3.1 that\nT \u22121 (qLp (N )q) is a corner of Lp (M). But T \u22121 (qLp (N )q) is contained in aLp (M),\nso being a corner it must be a central summand. Using Lemma 4.1 we conclude\nthat qLp (N )q = T [T \u22121(qLp (N )q)] is a central summand, which is a contradiction.\nCombined with a symmetric argument for T \u22121 , this proves the lemma.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.3.\n(1) The image of any corner under T is again a corner.\n(2) If q \u2208 P(M) is strictly between 0 and 1 on all central summands, then\n(4.7)\n\nT (Lp (M)q) = Lp (N )q1 z \u2032 + q2 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 z \u2032 ),\nfor some q1 , q2 \u2208 P(N ), z \u2032 \u2208 P(Z(N )), with q1 z \u2032 +q2 (1\u2212z \u2032) strictly between\n0 and 1 on every central summand.\n\nProof. For the first statement, let p1 Lp (M)p2 be an arbitrary corner. Then there\nare central projections y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 with sum 1, such that\n\u2022 p1 , p2 are strictly between 0 and 1 on every central subsummand of My1 ;\n\u2022 p1 Lp (M)p2 y2 is a column which contains no central summand and has\ncentral support y2 ;\n\u2022 p1 Lp (M)p2 y3 is a row which contains no central summand and has central\nsupport y3 ;\n\u2022 p1 Lp (M)p2 y4 is a central summand.\nBy Lemma 4.1, T preserves central sums and takes central summands to central\nsummands. Therefore we may treat each of the cases separately, and the fourth\ncase is clear. For the first case, p1 Lp (M)p2 y1 and (1 \u2212 p1 )Lp (M)(1 \u2212 p2 )y1 are\northocomplements in Lp (My1 ), so by Lemma 3.1 their images are corners. The\nsecond case (and symmetrically, the third) will follow from the second statement\nof the theorem, as the right-hand side of (4.7) is a corner.\nThe proof of the second statement requires some juggling with projections, so\nwe pause here to sketch the idea. First, if we specialize to the case where M and\n\n\fNONCOMMUTATIVE Lp\n\n9\n\nN are factors, (4.7) says that the image of a column is either a column or a row.\nFor non-factors and columns as described, the image is a central sum of a column\nand row, with z \u2032 demarcating the two pieces.\nThe proof is effected by using the projection q to divide Lp (M) into four corners,\neach of which is an orthocomplement. The original column is divided into two\ncorners, A and B, and we show that the \"checkerboard\" array is preserved by T .\nVisually,\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\nA 0);\nA B\u22a5 .\nLp (M)q = ( B\nL\n(M)\n=\n0\nB A\u22a5\nWhen the algebras are factors, there are only two (schematic) possibilities for T :\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nT (A) T (B)\nT (A) T (B)\u22a5\nA B\u22a5\nA B\u22a5\nT : B\n\u2192\n7\nand\nT\n:\n\u2192\n7\n.\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nT (B) T (A)\nA\nT (B) T (A)\nB A\nTo show this we need to look hard at the pairs of projections defining T (A) and\nT (B). We will see that either the left projections agree and the right projections\nare orthogonal with sum 1, or vice versa. To make the bookkeeping a little more\nconfusing, on non-factors the two possibilities can each happen on a central summand.\nSo we now assume the hypotheses of the second statement, and set A = qLp (M)q,\nB = (1 \u2212 q)Lp (M)q. As argued in the fourth case above, T (A) and T (B) are corners, say r1 Lp (N )r2 and s1 Lp (N )s2 . Since A and B neither contain nor are disjoint\nfrom any central summand, the same is true for T (A) and T (B). It follows that\nr1 , r2 , s1 , s2 are strictly between 0 and 1 on all central summands.\nSubstituting into (3.1),\n\u03be \u2208 A, \u03b7 \u2208 B\n\n\u21d2\n\n[\u03be, \u03b7] = 0.\n\nBy Lemma 3.2, any pair of vectors from T (A) and T (B) also has semi-inner product\nzero. Lemma 3.3 then tells us that the central supports x1 of r1 s1 and x2 of r2 s2\nare orthogonal.\nNotice that T (B \u22a5 ) = T (B)\u22a5 = (1 \u2212 s1 )Lp (N )(1 \u2212 s2 ), and similarly for T (A\u22a5 ).\nNow we apply the reasoning of the previous two paragraphs to the pair A, B \u22a5 ,\nshowing that the central supports w1 of r1 (1\u2212s1 ) and w2 of r2 (1\u2212s2 ) are orthogonal.\nBut w1 \u2265 1 \u2212 x1 , since\nr1 (1 \u2212 s1 )(1 \u2212 x1 ) = (r1 \u2212 r1 s1 )(1 \u2212 x1 ) = r1 (1 \u2212 x1 ).\n(The central support of the left-hand side is \u2264 w1 , of the right-hand side is 1 \u2212 x1 .)\nSimilarly w2 \u2265 1 \u2212 x2 . Since x1 , x2 and w1 , w2 are orthogonal pairs, we must have\nw1 = x2 , w2 = x1 , and x1 + x2 = 1.\nThe preceding argument uses the pairs (A, B) and (A, B \u22a5 ). If we make the same\nargument for (A, B) and (A\u22a5 , B), then for (A, B \u22a5 ) and (A\u22a5 , B \u22a5 ), we may conclude\nthat x1 is the central support of each of r1 s1 , r2 (1 \u2212 s2 ), (1 \u2212 r2 )s2 , (1 \u2212 r1 )(1 \u2212 s1 ),\nwhile x2 = 1 \u2212 x1 is the central support of each of r2 s2 , r1 (1 \u2212 s1 ), (1 \u2212 r1 )s1 , (1 \u2212\nr2 )(1 \u2212 s2 ). We write out two implications:\nr2 s2 x1 = 0 = (1 \u2212 r2 )(1 \u2212 s2 )x1 = (1 \u2212 r2 \u2212 s2 + r2 s2 )x1\n\n\u21d2\n\nx1 = (r2 + s2 )x1 .\n\n(r1 \u2212 r1 s1 )x1 = r1 (1 \u2212 s1 )x1 = 0 = (1 \u2212 r1 )s1 x1 = (s1 \u2212 r1 s1 )x1 \u21d2 r1 x1 = s1 x1 .\nSymmetrically x2 = (r1 + s1 )x2 and r2 x2 = s2 x2 .\n\n\f10\n\nDAVID SHERMAN\n\nBased on these last conclusions, we calculate\nT (Lp (M)q) = T (A) + T (B)\n= r1 Lp (N )r2 + s1 Lp (N )s2\n= (r1 Lp (N )r2 + s1 Lp (N )s2 )x2 + (r1 Lp (N )r2 + s1 Lp (M)s2 )x1\n= Lp (N )r2 x2 + r1 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 x2 ),\nwhich verifies (4.7) by taking q1 = r2 , q2 = r1 , and z \u2032 = x2 .\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that the projections q1 z \u2032 , q2 (1 \u2212 z \u2032 ), z \u2032 of Lemma 4.3(2) are all uniquely\ndetermined by q. Even more is true.\nLemma 4.4. Assume that M has no abelian summand. The central projection z \u2032 ,\ndefined in Lemma 4.3(2), does not depend on the choice of q.\nProof. Of course, all choices are still assumed to be strictly between 0 and 1 on\nall central summands. For projections other than q we will use obvious variants of\n(4.7).\nFirst observe that z \u2032 does not change if we replace q by a smaller projection q\u0307.\nJust write\nLp (N )q1 z \u2032 + q2 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 z \u2032 ) = T (Lp (M)q)\n\u2287 T (Lp (M)q\u0307)\n= Lp (N )q\u03071 \u017c \u2032 + q\u03072 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 \u017c \u2032 ).\nSince columns which contain no central summands never contain nonzero rows (and\nvice versa), we must have z \u2032 = \u017c \u2032 .\nWe also claim that z \u2032 does not change if we replace q by a projection q\u0308 with\nq \u2227 q\u0308 = 0. In this case we get the disjointness of\nT (Lp (M)q) = Lp (N )q1 z \u2032 + q2 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 z \u2032 )\nand\nT (Lp (M)q\u0308) = Lp (N )q\u03081 z\u0308 \u2032 + q\u03082 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 z\u0308 \u2032 ).\nA row and a column with overlapping central support always have nonzero intersection, so necessarily z \u2032 = z\u0308 \u2032 .\nFinally, given any other projection r, let y be the central support of q \u2227 r. We\nmay consider T restricted to Lp (M)y; by Lemma 4.1 this is still an Lp isometry.\nThe second paragraph shows that the (now restricted) projection z \u2032 does not change\nif we go from q to q \u2227 r to r. Similarly, for T restricted to Lp (M)(1 \u2212 y), the third\nparagraph allows us to pass from q to r without altering the restriction of z \u2032 . \u0003\nLemma 4.5. Assume that M has no abelian summand, let z \u2032 be as in Lemma 4.4,\nand let z be the corresponding central projection in M. Then on Lp (M)z, T takes\ncolumns to columns, while on Lp (M)(1 \u2212 z), T takes columns to rows.\nProof. Let Lp (M)r \u2282 Lp (M)z be a column containing no central summand, and\nlet z0 \u2264 z be the central support of r. Find a projection \u1e59 with central support\n\n\fNONCOMMUTATIVE Lp\n\n11\n\n(1 \u2212 z0) so that Lp (M)(r + \u1e59) still contains no central summands. Applying Lemma\n4.3 for the projection q = r + \u1e59,\nT (Lp (M)r) = T (Lp (M)(r + \u1e59)z0 ) = [T (Lp (M)(r + \u1e59))]z0\u2032\n= [Lp (N )q1 z \u2032 + q2 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 z \u2032 )]z0\u2032 = Lp (N )q1 z0\u2032 .\nAn arbitrary column in Lp (M)z is a central sum of a central summand and a\ncolumn containing no central summands. By Lemma 4.1 and the preceding paragraph, its image under T is a central sum of columns, which is again a column. The\nargument for Lp (M)(1 \u2212 z) is similar.\n\u0003\nNow we return to general M, N and look to divide our problem into two pieces.\nWith aM the abelian summand of M, we apply Lemma 4.5 to the restriction\n\u223c\nT : Lp (M)(1\u2212a) \u2192 Lp (N )(1\u2212a\u2032 ). This gives us a central projection z \u2264 1\u2212a such\n\u223c\nthat for any central projection y with z \u2264 y \u2264 z + a, the restriction T : Lp (M)y \u2192\n\u223c\nLp (N )y \u2032 takes columns to columns, while T : Lp (M)(1 \u2212 y) \u2192 Lp (N )(1 \u2212 y \u2032 )\ntakes columns to rows. (On Lp (M)a and Lp (N )a\u2032 , there is no difference between\ncolumns, rows, and corners, as all are central summands.) For now we focus on one\npiece, renaming Lp (M)y as Lp (M), Lp (N )y \u2032 as Lp (N ), and the restriction of T as\nT . We have that\n(4.8)\n\nT (Lp (M)q) = Lp (N )\u03c0r (q)\n\nfor a well-defined increasing map \u03c0r between projection lattices.\nIt follows from Lemma 4.3(2) that when q is strictly between 0 and 1 on every\ncentral summand which contains no abelian summand, \u03c0r (q) is as well. So if we\napply Lemmas 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 to T \u22121 , we see that T \u22121 also takes columns to columns,\nand both T and T \u22121 take rows to rows. More importantly, \u03c0r is bijective. Now\nequation (4.8) implies that sr (T (\u03be)) \u2264 \u03c0r (sr (\u03be)) for any \u03be \u2208 Lp (M). Since we can\nmake the same argument for T \u22121 , we must actually have that\n(4.9)\n\nsr (T (\u03be)) = \u03c0r (sr (\u03be)),\n\n\u03be \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nWe claim that \u03c0r preserves orthogonality of projections. Indeed, if e \u22a5 f in\nP(M), then any \u03be \u2208 Lp (M)e and \u03b7 \u2208 Lp (M)f have semi-inner product zero.\nCombining Lemmas 3.2, 3.3, and equation (4.8) gives \u03c0r (e) \u22a5 \u03c0r (f ).\nLet \u03be \u2208 Lp (M) and p \u2208 P(M). Using (4.9) and properties of \u03c0r ,\n(4.10)\n\nT (\u03bep) = T (\u03bep)\u03c0r (p) = T (\u03bep)\u03c0r (p) + T (\u03be(1 \u2212 p))\u03c0r (p) = T (\u03be)\u03c0r (p).\n\nNow we extend \u03c0r in a standard way: first by linearity to real linear combinations\nof orthogonal projections, then by continuity to self-adjoint elements, then by the\nequation\n\u03c0r (x + iy) = \u03c0r (x) + i\u03c0r (y),\nx, y \u2208 Msa ,\nto all of M. To see that \u03c0r is linear, note that by construction we have\n(4.11)\n\nT (\u03bex) = T (\u03be)\u03c0r (x),\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 Lp (M), \u2200x \u2208 M.\n\nSo for any x, y \u2208 M, \u03be \u2208 Lp (M),\nT (\u03be)(\u03c0r (x) + \u03c0r (y)) = T (\u03bex) + T (\u03bey) = T (\u03be(x + y)) = T (\u03be)\u03c0r (x + y),\nwhich implies \u03c0r (x) + \u03c0r (y) = \u03c0r (x + y). By construction \u03c0r is *-preserving and\nbijective. Finally, take x, y \u2208 M, \u03be \u2208 Lp (M), and calculate\n(4.12)\n\nT (\u03be)\u03c0r (xy) = T (\u03bexy) = T (\u03bex)\u03c0r (y) = T (\u03be)\u03c0r (x)\u03c0r (y).\n\n\f12\n\nDAVID SHERMAN\n\nApparently \u03c0r : M \u2192 N is also multiplicative.\nBeing a surjective *-isomorphism, \u03c0r induces a surjective isometry from Lp (M)\nto Lp (N ) as discussed earlier in this section. We will denote this map by \u03c1: key\nproperties are\n\u03c1(x\u03bey) = \u03c0r (x)\u03c1(\u03be)\u03c0r (y),\n\n\u03c1(\u03c61/p ) = (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c0r\u22121 )1/p ,\n\nfor x, y \u2208 M, \u03be \u2208 Lp (M), \u03c6 \u2208 M+\n\u2217.\nNow we consider the surjective isometry T \u25e6 \u03c1\u22121 : Lp (N ) \u2192 Lp (N ). This is\nactually a right module map:\nT \u25e6 \u03c1\u22121 (\u03bex) = T (\u03c1\u22121 (\u03be)\u03c0r\u22121 (x)) = T \u25e6 \u03c1\u22121 (\u03be)x,\n\nx \u2208 N , \u03be \u2208 Lp (N ).\n\nIt is known that the left and right module actions of N on Lp (N ) are commutants\nof each other. (This was first shown in [30, Proposition 35], or see [12, Theorem 1.5]\nfor a stronger result.) Thus T \u25e6 \u03c1\u22121 is given by left multiplication by an element of\nN , and by [12, Lemma 1.1] the element has norm equal to kT k = 1. The same is\ntrue for [T \u25e6 \u03c1\u22121 ]\u22121 , so the element is unitary - call it u. Then for all \u03c6 \u2208 M+\n\u2217,\n(4.13)\n\nT (\u03c61/p ) = T \u25e6 \u03c1\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c1(\u03c61/p ) = u\u03c1(\u03c61/p ) = u(\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c0r\u22121 )1/p ,\n\nwhich was to be shown.\nWhat about the case where T takes columns to rows and vice versa? Equation\n(4.9) becomes sr (T (\u03be)) = \u03c0r (sl (\u03be)), (4.11) becomes T (x\u03be) = T (\u03be)\u03c0r (x), and a\ncalculation parallel to (4.12) shows that \u03c0r is antimultiplicative. Associating the Lp\nisometry \u03c1 to \u03c0r as before, we still have that T \u25e6 \u03c1\u22121 is a right module map, and the\nconclusion (4.13) follows. So in the general case with both summands present, we\nmay take the sum of the two partial isometries as the unitary w, and the sum of the\n*-homomorphism and *-antihomomorphism as the surjective Jordan *-isomorphism\nJ. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is complete.\n5. Remarks on the proof\n\u00a71. We chose to work with columns in Lp (N ) because of the desired polar\ndecomposition. In the multiplicative case handled first, one can also find a surjective *-isomorphism \u03c0l : M \u2192 N such that equation (4.11) becomes T (y\u03bex) =\n\u03c0l (y)T (\u03be)\u03c0r (x). Moreover we have \u03c0l (y) = u\u03c0r (y)u\u2217 . Obvious variants hold for the\nantimultiplicative and general cases.\n\u00a72. It is possible to obtain the main results of this paper without using semi-inner\nproducts. There is an alternate route to Lemma 4.3 which is essentially simpler,\nbut unfortunately it does not apply to algebras with finite type I summands. So\nin order to build a complete proof in this way, one must also isolate the finite type\nI summands by methods similar to Lemma 4.2, and apply there a known result\n(like [37, Theorem 2]). We found it preferable to give a unified proof, with no\ndependence on type or previous isometry results.\nHowever, the alternate proof has the significant advantage of applying equally\nwell to 0 < p \u2264 1. (For 0 < p < 1, Lp (M) is a p-Banach space.) Since this may be\nof interest to some readers, the argument is featured in [26], where the case p = 1 is\ncarried out explicitly and used to give a new proof of the noncommutative BanachStone theorem. (By this we mean the nonunital C*-algebra version of Theorem 2.2,\nwhich was first stated by Paterson and Sinclair [21] in 1972.) Therefore Theorems\n1.1 and 1.2 are also true for 0 < p \u2264 1. The only other amendment to their proofs\n\n\fNONCOMMUTATIVE Lp\n\n13\n\nis that equations (4.3) and (4.4) must be justified directly, as interpolation cannot\nbe used.\n\u00a73. Equation (4.9) is already enough to settle the implication (2) \u2192 (1) in Theorem 1.1. A bijective map between projection lattices which preserves orthogonality\nis called an orthoisomorphism; Dye [4] showed that such a map is the restriction\nof a surjective Jordan *-isomorphism off of the type I2 summand. Since \u03c0r\u22121 is also\nan orthoisomorphism, it follows that T maps the I2 summands to each other. But\nT induces an isomorphism of centers, so the I2 summands have isomorphic centers\nand are therefore also *-isomorphic.\n\u00a74. One can use Lemma 4.3(1) to define the following map:\n(5.1)\n\n(q1 , q2 ) 7\u2192 (Sl (q1 , q2 ), Sr (q1 , q2 )),\n\nq1 , q2 \u2208 P(M),\n\nwhere Sl (q1 , q2 ) and Sr (q1 , q2 ) are the unique projections in N with identical central\nsupport satisfying\nT (q1 Lp (M)q2 ) = Sl (q1 , q2 )Lp (N )Sr (q1 , q2 ).\nBecause T preserves orthogonality, the map (5.1) is almost an orthoisomorphism\nfrom M \u2295 M to N \u2295 N . The deficit has to do with central support; if one requires\nthat the two inputs have identical central support, (5.1) \"densely defines\" an orthoisomorphism. In fact it is possible to show the strong continuity of this map and\nin this way construct an actual orthoisomorphism, at least when M has no type I\nsummand.\nEdwards and R\u00fcttimann [5] specifically studied CP (M), the complete *-lattice\nof pairs of projections with equal central support. Just as we have suggested this as\na tool for studying Lp corners, they use an equivalence with the set of L\u221e corners\nq1 Mq2 . This, in turn, is naturally equivalent to the lattice of structural projections\nand the lattice of weak*-closed inner ideals, both defined in terms of the Jordan\ntriple structure of M. Their paper actually formalizes, in the language of lattice\ntheory and Jordan triple systems, some of our manipulations of corners.\nAcknowledgments.
