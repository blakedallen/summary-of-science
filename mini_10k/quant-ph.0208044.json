Chang\net al . [9] found a way to produce a final state which was\na superposition of the bare atomic states. They used two\ncontemporary chirped pulses. They have shown how the\nselectivity of the final states depends upon the relative\nsign of chirping rate and detuning. Further, Unanyan et\nal . in the tripod-STIRAP scheme [10] have shown how\none can create an arbitrary superposition of two atomic\nstates using a sequence of three pulses in a four level\nsystem and how the superposition can be controlled by\nchanging the relative delay between the pulses. Marte et\nal . [11] and more recently Vitanov et al . [12] suggested\nanother method, called fractional STIRAP, in which, the\ntwo counterintuitive pulses terminate at the same time\nto produce appropriate superposition states. In a recent\ndevelopment, Kr\u00e1l and Shapiro [13] has found another\nunique way of creating a superposition of many energyeigenstates by the method of shaped adiabatic passage\n(SAP).\nSo far we have discussed different methods of either the\npopulation transfer or the preparation of superpositions,\nall starting from a given unperturbed state. Now the\nquestion arises whether one can create a superposition,\nstarting from a superposition state, i.e., produce essentially the rotation of a qubit. Renzoni and Stenholm [14]\nused four laser pulses which coupled four ground levels\nto a common excited level and created a superposition\nof two ground states, starting from a superposition of\ntwo other ground states. Most recently Kis and Renzoni\n[15] have discovered how to create the superposition in\nthe same basis as of the initial superposition state. They\nhave used the tripod-STIRAP scheme to show how the\nrelative phase of the control pulse controls the superposition of the atomic states in the final superposition.\nThis is quite relevant in the context of qubit rotation. If\none thinks of the initial superposition state as one qubit\nstate, then creating another superposition in the same\nbasis refers to the rotation of the qubit in the Hilbert\nspace of those two basis states.\nAll the above methods are based on the adiabatic evolution of atomic system. The question arises, whether\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe growing field of quantum computation and quantum information involves logical operations with quantum states. The single qubit operation is its inversion and\nrotation whereas the controlled-NOT and phase-gates require two qubits. Any specific computation consists of\nproper manipulation using these operations [1].\nAll these can be implemented on the basis of one's ability to prepare the atomic system in desired states. Such\na preparation has been studied using a variety of techniques using external fields. For example, by Rabi flopping [2] one can transfer the population completely to\nanother orthogonal state. However this requires perfect\ncontrol on pulse area. A more efficient way to transfer\npopulations has been proposed by Oreg et al. [3]. They\nhave shown how to transfer the population between the\ndipole forbidden levels in multilevel systems using the\nidea of adiabatic following [4]. They have predicted the\nuse of two delayed pulses in a three level \u039b system in\nthe large detuning domain for this purpose. Their idea of\ncounter-intuitively ordered pulses has been implemented\nin a technique of population transfer called Stimulated\nRaman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) [5] . Under conditions of adiabaticity, the atom follows the evolution of one\nof the eigenvectors of the time-dependent Hamiltonian.\nGrobe et al., under the same condition of adiabaticity,\nused the idea of delayed pulses in counterintuitive sequence in the context of formation of shape-preserving\npulses (adiabatons) [6]. Note that, in STIRAP, both the\npulses can in principle be kept resonant with the corresponding atomic transitions. Vitanov and Stenholm\n[7] investigated the effect of Raman detuning on the final\nstate population in STIRAP starting from one of the two\nlower states. They used two delayed Gaussian pulses for\nthis purpose. They found that, as the detuning increases,\nthe final state population decreases. Sola et al. [8] used\ntwo contemporary chirped pulses and investigated how\nthe final state population varies with the chirp rate of\nthe pulses. They demonstrated the role of detuning in\nminimizing the intermediate level population.\n1\n\n\fFIG. 1. Level configuration for a double-\u039b system. Here\nG1 and G2 are one-half of the Rabi frequencies of the applied\nclassical fields which couple the level |1i to |gi and |f i, respectively. The classical fields with Rabi frequencies 2\u03a91 (t)\nand 2\u03a92 (t) couple the level |ei to |gi and |f i. \u22061 and \u22062 are\ntheir respective one-photon detunings.\n\none can go beyond the adiabatic limit. In the present\npaper, we explore this possibility in the context of a\nthree level \u039b-system interacting with two laser pulses.\nIn nonadiabatic evolution, transition occurs between the\ndifferent adiabatic states of the system [16]. During this\nrotation the state no longer remains confined in the twodimensional Hilbert space of the basis states comprising\nthe superposition. Thus a different superposition of the\nbasis states is prepared in the long time limit.\nWe use a double-\u039b configuration for the demonstration\nof the rotation of a qubit. We note that the light propagation through an atomic medium in such a configuration\nhas been studied [17,18].\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we\ndescribe the model configuration and relevant equations\nfor the process of qubit rotation. In Sec. III, we present\ndetailed numerical results on the rotation of a qubit. We\ndiscuss the role of detuning and other pulse parameters\nin this context. In Sec. IV, we present a comparison of\nour results with those obtained using two-level approximation. In Sec. V, we discuss the nonadiabaticity in the\nevolution. In Sec. VI, we consider the effect of chirped\npulses on the rotation of a qubit. It may be noted that\npulses with appropriate time-dependent phases have been\nused to achieve coherent control of quantum systems [19].\nIn the Appendix, we show how the traditional STIRAP\ncan be used to prepare the atomic system in a state which\nis orthogonal to the initial superposition.\n\nA. Preparation of the initial superposition state\n\nWe start with the atom initially in the level |gi. We\napply two cw fields with constant Rabi frequencies 2G1\nand 2G2 which couple the state |1i with |gi and |f i, respectively. We assume these fields to be resonant with\nthe corresponding transitions. When the cw fields are\nswitched on, the system is prepared in the state\n|ii = \u03b1|gi + \u03b2ei\u03c6 |f i,\n\n(1)\np\n2\n2\nwhere, \u03b1 = G1 /G, \u03b2 = G2 /G, G = G1 + G2 and\n\u03c6 is the relative phase between |gi and |f i. This is the\ndesired state, which will be considered as the initial state\nof the qubit in the next phase of evolution.\nB. Basic equations for qubit rotation\n\nWe will now discuss how one can rotate the qubit in\nstate (1), i.e., how one can create another superposition\nof |gi and |f i. When the cw fields are switched off, we\napply two chirped laser pulses with electromagnetic fields\ngiven by\nE1 (t) = \u03b51 (t)e\u2212i\u03c91 t e\u2212i\u03c61 (t) + c.c.,\n\nII.

We further assume that, the pulses do not\nhave any relative phase difference, i.e., \u03b4 = 0 and have\nequal magnitudes, i.e., \u03a901 = \u03a902 .

Effect of the detuning parameter \u2206 on the time\ndependence of the populations of the levels |ei, |gi, and |f i\nfor different values of \u2206\u03c4 = 45 (solid curve), \u2206\u03c4 = 60\n(dot-dashed curve), and \u2206\u03c4 = 120 (dashed curve).

The variation of populations of\nthe levels |gi (dashed curve) and |f i (dot-dashed curve) with\n\u2206 at long time (t = 15\u03c4 ) is shown in the inset with the same\nnumerical parameters as above.\n\nWe plot the variation of populations in the levels |ei,\n|gi, and |f i with time for different values of \u2206, in Fig.\n2. We note that in the long time limit the population\ngets redistributed in the levels |gi and |f i with almost\nno population in |ei. As the value of \u2206 varies, the pop3\n\n\fulations in |gi and |f i also vary. We show in the inset\nof Fig. 2 how the populations in |gi and |f i in the long\ntime limit vary with \u2206. In this limit, the intermediate\nlevel population becomes almost zero. This is the case\neven when \u03b1 = 1, i.e., if the initial state is |gi. Fig. 3\nclearly shows remarkably large change in the final state\npopulation with \u2206 (see also [7]). This, as we will see in\nSec. V, has bearing on the adiabatic behavior.\nThe relative phase \u03c6 of the levels |gi and |f i is given\nby\n\n1.0\n|f>\n\n0.8\n\nPopulations\n\ncos \u03c6(t) = Re[c\u2217g cf /|cg |.|cf |].\n\nIt should be mentioned here that one can get approximated analytical solutions of Eqs. (7), putting \u03c7i = 0\n(i = 1, 2) [7,20,21]. However, all these solutions are for\n\u03b1 = 1. For \u03b1 6= 1, as discussed in the present section, it\nis very difficult to obtain the solution analytically.\n\n(9)\n\nIn Fig. 4, we have shown the time-dependence of cos \u03c6(t).\nClearly, the phase at the long time limit becomes constant. This means, a different coherent superposition of\n|gi and |f i has been created. This implies to a rotation\nof the concerned qubit, which is controlled by one-photon\ndetuning \u2206.\nNote that for intermediate times, the level |ei gets populated. Thus the atomic system initially in the state\n|ii no longer remains confined in the two-dimensional\nHilbert plane of |gi and |f i. Rather, it travels through\nthe three-dimensional Hilbert space of the levels |ei, |gi,\nand |f i and finally comes back to the initial space of\nstates |gi and |f i, but with a different composition of\nthem.\nFrom the above discussions, one can infer that the\namount of rotation can be suitably controlled by the\none-photon detuning parameter \u2206. For example, for\n\u2206\u03c4 \u223c 180, one can prepare an equal superposition state\nof the levels |gi and |f i with phase \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/3 (see inset,\nFig. 2). We emphasize that for \u2206 = 0, the level |ei remains populated at large times. So large values of the\ndetuning \u2206 are needed for proper qubit rotation.\nIt is interesting to note that the time separation T between the pulses affects the qubit rotation as shown in\nFig. 5 which depicts the variation of populations in |gi\nand |f i with T . It should be noted that at long time, the\nlevel |ei does not get populated.\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b1=1.0\n\u03b1=0.3\n\n0.4\n|e>\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n|g>\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n\u03a901/\u03a902\n\nFIG. 6.

We continue to\nkeep both the pulses equally detuned by an amount of \u2206.\nIn Fig. 6, we show the long time behavior of populations\nin the levels |ei, |gi, and |f i as functions of the parameter \u03a901 /\u03a902 . We present results for both the cases when\nthe atom starts in the state |gi and the state |ii with\n\u03b1 = 0.3 and \u03c6 = \u03c0/2. Note that the population in the\nlevel |ei is negligible for large times. The population is\nredistributed in the levels |gi and |f i.

Effect of relative phase of the two pulses\n\nWe will now discuss how the amount of qubit rotation\ncan be controlled by the relative phase \u03b4 between the two\npulses. We work under the two-photon resonance condition and take the pulses to have equal amplitudes. The\nperiodic dependence of the populations of |gi and |f i on\n\u03b4 in the long time limit for the initial condition (8) is\nshown in Fig. 8. Thus the relative phase of the input\npulses can be used as an useful control parameter for the\nqubit rotation.\nIt should be mentioned here that, if \u03b1 = 1, i.e., if the\natom is initially prepared in the state |gi, then there is\nno \u03b4-dependence of the populations in the states |gi and\n|f i. This is because the Eqs. (7) can be redefined with an\nextra complex phase term in the probability amplitudes.\nFor example, the replacements d \u0303e = de ei\u03b4 , d \u0303f = df ei\u03b4 ,\nand d \u0303g = dg keep the form of the equations unchanged.\nThus \u03b4 does not show up in the square moduli of these\namplitudes. However, the wave functions would be different for different values of \u03b4 and the probability amplitudes become different. Thus, if the atom is initially in\nthe state |gi, then a change in \u03b4 cannot produce arbitrary\nrotation of |gi.\n\nActual\nApproximated\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n|f>\n\u22121.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\nt/\u03c4\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\nFIG. 9.

Thus the\nthree-level atomic system can be approximated as a twolevel system with effective Rabi-frequency \u03a9e and effective detuning \u2206e [Eq. (11)]. It is well-known that in a\ntwo-level atomic system, if detuning of the pulse is much\nlarger than the pulse amplitude, then the induced polarization of the atom follows the time-evolution of the\npopulation term [4]. This is referred to as adiabatic following. Similarly, if |\u2206e | \u226b |\u03a9e |, then, adiabatic following occurs in a three-level system also.\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\n2\n\nf1 f2\u2217 /\u2206,\n\n(10)\n5\n\n\fWe present the exact and two-level approximated results for the variation of the populations in |gi and |f i\nin Figs. 9 and 10 for different values of \u2206. Clearly, for\nsmaller values of \u2206, the two-level approximation is not\nvalid. But still rotation of the qubit occurs. Only when\n\u2206 \u226b \u03a90i , exact numerical result and two-level approximated result match, as we stated earlier. This is because,\nin this case, the level |ei is hardly populated during the\nevolution and the system thereby keeps itself confined in\nthe Hilbert plane of |gi and |f i. Thus the rotation of\na qubit can be obtained even for values of \u2206 for which\ntwo-level approximation is not valid.\n\nThe eigenstates (or the adiabatic states) of H are given\nby,\n|a0 i = cos \u0398|gi \u2212 sin \u0398|f i,\n|a+ i = sin \u0398 cos \u03a6|gi \u2212 sin \u03a6|ei + cos \u0398 cos \u03a6|f i,\n|a\u2212 i = sin \u0398 sin \u03a6|gi + cos \u03a6|ei + cos \u0398 sin \u03a6|f i,\n\n(14a)\n(14b)\n(14c)\n\nwhere\ntan \u0398 = \u03a91 (t)/\u03a92 (t),\n\n(15)\n\n1.0\n\nand\nPopulations\n\n0.8\n\n|a+>\n\np\n2 |\u03a91 |2 + |\u03a92 |2\np\ntan \u03a6 =\n.\n\u2206 + \u22062 + 4(|\u03a91 |2 + |\u03a92 |2 )\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n|a0>\n\nThe state (14a) is the well-known coherent population\ntrapping state.

It is clear that\nduring the course of evolution, transfer of population occurs between the states, namely |a0 i and |a+ i. Thus the\nnonadiabatic coupling is no more small enough to keep\nthe process adiabatic. Clearly the system evolves nonadiabatically in the chosen parameter domain.\n\nFIG. 11. Variation of populations in the adiabatic states\n|a0 i and |a+ i [Eqs. (14)] with time for \u2206\u03c4 = 60. The other\nparameters are same as in Fig. 9.\n\nV. TRANSITIONS AMONG ADIABATIC STATES\n- NONADIABATICITY\n\nNote that even when \u03b1 = 1, for larger \u2206 the evolution\nbecomes nonadiabatic [Fig. 3] for a constant value of \u03a90i .\nIf the system were to stay in the adiabatic state defined\nby H(t)|a0 i = 0, then the final state population would\nbe independent of the detuning. The \u2206-dependence of\nthe population in Fig. 3 implies that the dynamics of the\nsystem does not remain confined to the adiabatic state\n|a0 i only. Further note that for a given value of \u2206, large\nvalues of \u03a90i are required to make the evolution adiabatic. Fig. 7 supports the adiabatic result at large \u03a90i\n(\u03a901 /\u03a902 & 0.3) for \u2206 = 0, i.e., the system remains essentially in the state (14a).\n\nWe further address the question of nonadiabaticity.\nThe evolution of a quantum system is called adiabatic,\nif the populations of the adiabatic states (which are the\neigenstates of the time-dependent Hamiltonian) remain\nconstant during the evolution. This condition requires\nthat the nonadiabatic coupling between the adiabatic\nstates is much smaller than their energy difference [22,23].\nTo attain this, the Hamiltonian should be smoothly varying with time. In a three level \u039b system, if one uses two\nsmoothly varying pulses with large amplitudes in counterintuitive sequence, then the complete transfer of population occurs between the two lower lying levels of the\nsystem and also the evolution of the system becomes adiabatic [5]. One has to use the pulses in Raman resonance.\nEven when the pulses are one-photon resonant, then for\nlarge enough values of the pulse amplitudes the evolution\nbecomes adiabatic. In this light we examine the nonadiabaticity of the process of rotation described here. The\nHamiltonian (under the conditions \u22061 = \u22062 = \u2206 and\n\u03c71 = \u03c72 = 0) can be written in the (|ei, |gi, |f i) basis as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2212\u2206 \u03a91 \u03a92\nH = \uf8ed \u03a9\u22171 0 0 \uf8f8 .\n(13)\n\u03a9\u22172 0 0\n\nVI. QUBIT ROTATION CONTROLLED BY\nCHIRPING\n\nSo far we have discussed how the one-photon detuning\nof the pulses can be used to produce rotation of the qubit.\nWe now consider use of the chirped pulses for obtaining\narbitrary qubit rotation. We also examine the simultaneous effects of chirping and one-photon detuning.\n6\n\n\f|f i (results not shown) that populations in |gi and |f i\nin the long time limit becomes constant at a value depending on \u03c7 whereas the level |ei remains unpopulated.\nTherefore by changing the chirping rate \u03c7, we produce\narbitrary rotation to the state |ii. In Fig. 12 we show the\nvariations of populations of |gi and |f i in the long time\nlimit with the chirping parameter \u03c7 for different values\nof \u2206. Clearly, we can have a rotation irrespective of the\nrelative sign of \u03c7 and \u2206, but the amount of rotation is\nquite dependent on it. From Fig. 12, it is also clear that\nfor a constant value of \u03c7, one can have different rotation\nfor different values of detuning parameter \u2206. Thus by\nvarying either \u2206 [or \u03c7] while keeping \u03c7 [or \u2206] constant,\none has a way to achieve arbitrary rotation to the qubit\nstate |ii.\n\n1.0\n\n|f>\n\nPopulations\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n\u2206\u03c4=75\n\u2206\u03c4=\u221275\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\u221215.0\n\n|g>\n\n\u221210.0\n\n\u22125.0\n\n0.0\n\u03c7\n\n5.0\n\n10.0\n\n15.0\n\nFIG. 12.

Variations of populations in the levels |gi and |f i\nin the long time limit with \u03c72 /\u03c71 (\u03c71 = 1), is shown for positive and negative values of detunings. The other parameters\nare same as in Fig. 12.\n\nWe present here an alternative method of orthogonal\nrotation of a qubit initially in the superposition state |ii\n[Eq. (1)]. The state orthogonal to |ii is |ki which is given\nby Eq. (10). The method described here for rotation of\nthe qubit from the state |ii to |ki is a generalization of\nthe STIRAP process. This is implemented through adiabatic evolution. The Hamiltonian of the system is the\nsame as in (3), but with \u2206i = 0 and \u03c7i = 0 (i = 1, 2).\nWe rewrite this in terms of the basis states (|ii, |ki, |ei)\nin the following way :\n\nB.

We show the results for equal (\u03c71 = \u03c72 = \u03c7) as\nwell as for unequal (\u03c71 6= \u03c72 ) chirping. Clearly, in this\ncase also, rotation occurs irrespective of relative sign of\n\u03c7i 's and \u2206. However, if relative sign changes, amount of\nrotation also changes.\nWe note that, for \u2206 = 0, both kinds of chirping do not\nprovide any rotation to a general superposition state of\nthe qubit (\u03b1 6= 1). However, if the qubit is initially in\nstate |gi (\u03b1 = 1), then both profiles provide orthogonal\nrotation to the state |gi irrespective of relative values of\n\u03c7i 's. This is because the population in the excited state\nin the long time limit deceases as \u03b1 increases to unity.\n\n\u010bi = \u2212if1 (t)ce ,\n\u010bk = \u2212if2 (t)ce ,\n\u010be = \u2212i[f1\u2217 (t)ci + f2\u2217 (t)ck ],\n\n(A2)\n\nf1 (t) = \u03b1\u03a9\u22171 (t) + \u03b2e\u2212i\u03c6 \u03a9\u22172 (t),\nf2 (t) = \u03b2ei\u03c6 \u03a9\u22171 (t) \u2212 \u03b1\u03a9\u22172 (t).\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere\n\nWe solve these equations under the initial conditions\nci (\u2212\u221e) = 1, ck (\u2212\u221e) = ce (\u2212\u221e) = 0.\n\n(A4)\n\nIf one chooses the time-dependences of f1 and f2 in the\nfollowing way\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nf1 = exp [\u2212(t \u2212 T )2 /\u03c4 2 ],\nf2 = exp (\u2212t2 /\u03c4 2 ),\n\nIn conclusion, we have examined how one can produce a general rotation of the qubit in a superposition\nof the states |gi and |f i by using the nonadiabatic evolution. Two delayed pulses in two-photon resonance have\nbeen employed for this purpose. We have found that\neach of the parameters - one-photon detuning, amplitudes, phases, and chirpings of the two pulses can provide proper control of the qubit rotation. The effect of\ntime separation of the pulses has also been investigated.\nWe discussed the relevance of two-level approximation in\n\n(A5)\n\nthen, one can transfer the population from |ii to |ki adiabatically. This is analogous to the well known STIRAP\nprocess in which population is transferred from the state\n|gi to |f i. Using Eqs. (VII) and (VII) we obtain the form\nof the required pulses \u03a91 (t) and \u03a92 (t)\n\u03a91 (t) = \u03b1 exp [\u2212(t \u2212 T )2 /\u03c4 2 ] + \u03b2e\u2212i\u03c6 exp (\u2212t2 /\u03c4 2 ),\n\u03a92 (t) = \u03b2ei\u03c6 exp [\u2212(t \u2212 T )2 /\u03c4 2 ] \u2212 \u03b1 exp (\u2212t2 /\u03c4 2 ) (A6)\n8\n\n\fto transfer the population from the state |ii to its orthogonal state |ki.\n\n[7] N.

Thus the qubit is rotated from |ii to its\northogonal state |ki. One may note that as the evolution\ndescribed here is analogous to STIRAP, so the robustness of the process is similar to that of STIRAP. It is\nalso worth mentioning that one could rotate |ii to any\nother arbitrary superposition of |gi and |f i by just chopping the pulses \u03a91 (t) and \u03a92 (t) at the desired moment.\nBut this requires complete control on the pulse area.\n\n[1] The Physics of Quantum Information, edited by D.\nBouwmeester, A.
