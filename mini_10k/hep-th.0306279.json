This theorem has proved to be a very powerful tool in\ntwo-dimensional physics, with applications in conformal field theories and\nstring theory. Indeed, in the path-integral formalism, one must sum over\ntwo-dimensional topologies and geometries. Hence, in the path integral, one\ncan sum over deformations of each of these geometries, then sum over the\nhandle number.\nThe potential importance of a 3D uniformization theorem is also evident,\nparticularly in the context of (super)membrane physics or three-dimensional\nquantum gravity where one should be able to perform path-integral quantization via a similar procedure to that in two dimensions. Unfortunately,\nthere is no uniformization theorem in three dimensions, only a conjecture due\nto W.P. Thurston. [2]1 . This conjecture states that a three-manifold with a\ngiven topology has a canonical decomposition into 'simple three-manifolds,'\neach of which admits one, and only one, of eight homogeneous geometries:\nH 3 , S 3 , E 3 , S 2 \u00d7 S 1 , H 2 \u00d7 S 1 , Sol, Nil and SL(2,R). The first three geometries are maximally symmetric, and hence isotropic. The remaining five are\nanisotropic, and hence less symmetric, but all have at least a three parameter group of isometries. 2 The conjecture has not been completely proven,\nbut considerable progress has been made by Thurston [2] and recently there\nhas been speculation that Perelman [11] has overcome some roadblocks in\nHamilton's program to prove the conjecture using the 'Ricci flow' [12, 13].\nTo prove a uniformization theorem, one must show that a differentiable\nmanifold with a given topology admits a certain (highly symmetric) metric.\nThis is a formidable task, amounting to showing that structures admitted on\nsmall part of the manifold can be extended to cover the entirety of it. An\n1\n\nA fairly clear exposition of this can be found in the review article by P. Scott [3].\nThere has been some use made of the Geometrization Conjecture in cosmology, beginning\nwith the paper by Fagundes [4]. A non-exhaustive list of other work along these lines is\nin [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The role of the conjecture in high-energy physics is explored in [10].\n2\nRelativists are familiar with the classification of homogeneous geometries into the\nBianchi models. The relationship of the latter to the Thurston geometries is delineated in\n[4].\n\n1\n\n\falternative is to assume that the manifold admits some metric, then show\nthat the latter can be deformed by some process into the required highly\nsymmetric metric. The obvious choice of the deformation is to treat the\ninitial metric akin to a source of heat, and let the heat flow in 'time', via\nsome parabolic system of partial differential equations. The idea is that heat\n'uniformizes', so that at the end, as t \u2192 \u221e, the temperature is uniform.\nThe problem with this strategy is that one must find a parabolic system\nby which to flow the metric. In other words, the flow should be\n\u0121\u03bc\u03bd = O(g\u03bc\u03bd ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the operator O is elliptic. Furthermore, this operator must transform\nas a tensor under coordinate transformations. This restricts the operator to\nbe constructed from the curvature tensor. An obvious choice is the Ricci flow\n[12]\n\u0121\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122R\u03bc\u03bd .\n(2)\n\nThe first problem with this flow is that it is not strictly parabolic, though\nit shares many of the properties of simpler heat equations. In fact, it is not\neven a linear partial differential system, since the inverse of the metric appears in the Ricci tensor on the right hand side.3 Thus one must first resolve\nsome hard problems in analysis: the existence of 'short-time' flows; extension\nto finite times; the occurence of singularities before the flow might otherwise\nuniformize. Many of these issues have been resolved by Hamilton and others [13], but not all. In fact, a recent preprint by Perelman [11] claims to\nhave removed one of the major impediments in Hamilton's program to prove\nThurston's Conjecture via a slightly modified version of the Ricci flow.\nThere is another problem with the Ricci flow: how do you 'input' the\ntopology of the manifold? After all, uniformization really boils down to\nshowing that a given manifold topology implies admissibility of a unique (up\nto diffeomorphisms) homogeneous metric. For the case of closed 2D manifolds, it is pretty straightforward to modify the Ricci flow so that topology is\nspecified. This is due to the fact these manifolds are characterized as topological spaces by their Euler number \u03c7(M2 ), and the latter is related to the\ncurvature via the Gauss-Bonnet formula:\n1 Z\n\u221a\n\u03c7(M2 ) =\n(3)\nd2 x gR(g).\n2\u03c0 M2\n3\n\nIn an earlier work, one of us, (J.G.) in collaboration with S. Braham [14] considered\nthe Yang-Mills flow as a tool for examining uniformization theorems. Although promising\nin 2D, the 3D case proved intractable.\n\n2\n\n\fThe modified Ricci flow [12] is then\n\u0121\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122R\u03bc\u03bd +\n\n\u03c7(M2 )\ng\u03bc\u03bd ,\nV (M2 )\n\n(4)\n\nR\n\u221a\nwhere V (M2 ) := M2 d2 x g is the volume of M2 . This flow has as its fixed\npoints the constant curvature geometries. It was proved by Hamilton [15]\nand Chow [16] that this flow exists, and that it converges to its fixed pointsthus giving a new proof of the two dimensional uniformization theorem. The\nimportant point here is that the topology of M2 is explicit data in the second\nterm in the flow.\nUnfortunately, the 3D case is not nearly so simple. Besides the problem\nthat in general the 3D versions of the Ricci and modified Ricci flows have\nsingularities, the topology of a closed 3D manifold cannot be easily expressed\nas a data point on the right side of a modified Ricci flow. For example, the\nEuler number of a closed 3D manifold is zero. Thus a term in the 3D modified\nRicci flow proportional to the metric itself could not be obviously specified\nby topological data.\nOur proposal here is that if the flow is broadened to include other fields\ndefined on 3D space, then one can input at least some of the topological\ndata in an explicit way, much as in the 2D case. As will be shown in the\nnext section, such a flow is suggested by the low energy limit of a bosonic\nstring propogating in 3D space. In particular, there exists sectors of the theory, labelled by the values (actually signs) of parameters in the Lagrangian,\neach of which admit one, and only one, of the eight Thurston geometries,\nup to coordinate transformations. We are able to prove uniqueness of the\nsolutions for the case when the Chern-Simons term in the theory is turned\noff; but although plausible, uniqueness in the remaining two sectors has not\nrigorously been proven. Nonetheless it seems to us that these results are significantly encouraging and suggest that one might be able to use the flow in\nthis model to clarify and understand, and perhaps finally prove, the Thurston\nConjecture.\n\n2\n\nModified 3D Stringy Gravity\n\nOf the Thurston spaces, only E 3 , S 3 and H 3 are solutions of Einstein gravity with an appropriate cosmological constant term. In search of a single\ntheory from which all eight of the Thurston geometries arise, we turn to the\n3\n\n\flow-energy limit of three-dimensional string theory, which has a metric g\u03bc\u03bd ,\ndilaton \u03c6, Abelian 2-form potential B(2) with field strength H(3) = dB(2)\nand a 'constant' term in the level of the original sigma model [17, 18]. This\ntheory has many more solutions than the constant curvature geometries. In\nfact, it has propogating modes. If the dilaton is set to a constant value,\nthen for a given sign for the coupling of the H 2 term, the only solutions\nhave either constant, non-negative or non-positive metrics. The value of the\ncosmological constant is given by a constant of integration. But even with\nthe dilaton non-trivial, the remaining five anisotropic Thurston geometries\nare not solutions.\nWe therefore modify the above 3D stringy theory by appending to it a\nU(1) gauge field with potential 1-form A and field strength F which couple\nas a 'Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory'. The corresponding action is given by\n[19]:\n\u01ebH\n\u01ebF\n\u221a\nS =\nd x g e\u22122\u03c6 \u2212\u03c7 + R + 4|\u2207\u03c6|2 \u2212 H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 H \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd\n12\n2\ne \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n(5)\n+ \u01eb A\u03bc F\u03bd\u03c1 ,\n2\nZ\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere the last term is the Abelian Chern-Simons term for the one-form potential A(1) , and F(2) = dA(1) . The Wess-Zumino field B\u03bc\u03bd is a 2-form potential whose field strength H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u2202[\u03bc B\u03bd\u03c1] . Hence, in 3D, the field strength is\nproportional to the LeviCivita tensor:\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = H(x)\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere H(x) is a scalar field. The equations of motion for the 'Wess-Zumino\nfield' B\u03bc\u03bd are\nH \u03bd\u03c1 := \u2207\u03bc (e\u22122\u03c6 H(x)\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ) = 0.\n(7)\nIt is easy to see that the latter implies that H(x) = c = constant. Without\nloss of generality, this result can be substituted into the remaining equations\nof motion.

In this case, by taking\nappropriate linear combinations of the trace of (8) and (10) one obtains constraints on the Ricci scalar and electromagnetic field strengths. In particular,\nthe Ricci scalar and the square of the field strength must both be constant:\n\u01ebH\nR = \u2212 c2 + 2\u03c7.\n(11)\n2\n\u0010\n\nF \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd = 2\u01ebF \u03c7 \u2212 \u01ebH c2\n\n\u0011\n\n(12)\n\nThese constraints will play an important role in what follows. They have\nthe effect of totally eliminating all propagating modes from the theory, leaving a finite dimensional space of solutions. This can be seen heuristically\nas follows. The full theory has two coupled dynamical modes, one for the\nscalar and one for the electromagnetic field. The gravitational field does not\npropagate in three spacetime dimensions. By restricting to constant \u03c6, the\ncoupling between \u03c6 and F\u03bc\u03bd gives rise to the constraint (12), which also eliminates the dynamical mode associated with electromagnetic field. Thus, the\nelectromagnetic field cannot fluctuate unless the scalar also fluctuates.\nAs will be shown below, all of the Thurston geometries are solutions of\nthe equations of motion of this theory for various values of the parameters\n\u03c7, \u01ebH , \u01ebF , e. See Table 1 for a list of the solutions. In particular, the addition\nof the Maxwell term alone (e = 0) yields S 2 \u00d7 E 1 , H 2 \u00d7 E 1 and Sol as\nsolutions. In this case, there exists a generalized Birkhoff theorem which\nguarantees that these are the only solutions when \u03c6 = constant. With e 6= 0,\none finds that the remaining Thurston geometries Nil and SL(2, R) are also\nsolutions. Although it seems plausible that these are the only solutions, we\nhave been unable to find a rigorous proof.\nWith the exceptions of Sol and H 3 , the Thurston spaces can be characterized topologically as Seifert fibre bundles \u03b7 over an orbifold Y . The topology\nof a Seifert fibre bundle is determined by the Euler number \u03c7(Y ) of Y and the\nEuler number e(\u03b7) of the bundle \u03b7 [2, 3, 10]. Table 2 gives the values of these\ntopological invariants for the 3-manifolds which admit Thurston geometries.\nIt turns out that for all these spaces, the parameter \u03c7 in the action is related\nto \u03c7(Y ) by \u03c7(Y ) = \u03c7. In addition, the constant e turns out to be related\nto the Euler number e(\u03b7). When the three-form field strength H(3) in the\nstring inspired model is real, the parameter \u01ebH is positive, whereas \u01ebH < 0\ncorresponds to an imaginaryH(3) . \u01ebH is positive only for the Thurston spaces\nwhich are Seifert fibre bundles, whereas Sol and H 3 require \u01ebH < 0.

From this Eq.(12)\nit follows immediately that:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nv 2 = F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd = \u01ebF \u03c7 \u2212 \u01ebH c2 .\n2\n\n(18)\n\nThe gravitational equations now take the simple form:\nE\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u01ebH 2\nc g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u01ebF (v 2 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 v\u03bc v\u03bd ) = 0;\n2\n\n(19)\n\n\u00bfFrom Eq.(19) it is easy to see that on shell, the Ricci scalar has three\nconstant eigenvalues\n\u01ebH c2\n,\n2\n\u01ebH c2\n.\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = \u03c7 \u2212\n2\n\u03bb1 =\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nwith corresponding eigenvectors \u03bea\u03bc , a = 1, 2, 3 satisfy\n\u03be1\u03bc = \u03b1v \u03bc ,\nv\u03bc \u03bei\u03bc = 0, i = 2, 3,\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant. The second equations tells us that the \u03bei are a linearly\nindependent set of eigenvectors.\n\u00bfFrom the eigenvalue equation for \u03bb1 , namely,\nR\u03bc\u03bd v \u03bc =\n\n\u01ebH c2\nv\u03bd\n2\n\n(24)\n\none can show that:\n\u2207\u03bc v \u03bc = 0.\n7\n\n(25)\n\n\fSimply take the covariant derivative of both sides of (24), and use the Bianchi\nidentity and the constancy of the Ricci scalar to obtain (25).\nIt also follows from the Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations of motion that\n\u03bd\nv is constant norm tangent vector to a geodesic, so that\nv \u03bd \u2207\u03bd v \u03bc = 0.\n\n(26)\n\nIndeed from the first equality in Eq(16), it follows that after contracting with\nv \u03b1 we get\nv \u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 v\u03b2 \u2212 v \u03b1 \u2207\u03b2 v\u03b1 = 0.\n(27)\n\nSince v \u03b1 v\u03b1 =constant, it follows that the second term above vanishes, and\nthe vanishing of the first term is just the geodesic equation.\nTo summarize, the above analysis shows that the field equations require\nthe dual of the electromagnetic field strength to have constant norm, be\ndivergence free, and obey the geodesic equation. These conditions must hold\nfor all values of the parameters in the Lagrangian.\n\n4\n\nGravitational Equations\n\nWe will now use the vector field v \u03bc to specify a local coordinate system in\nwhich the metric takes a particularly simple form. Choose the coordinate\nsystem {x1 , x2 , y} so that\n!\u03bc\n\u2202\n= v\u03bc.\n(28)\n\u2202y\nWe will denote the dependence of a function f on the xj by f (x). Then from\nthe constancy of v\u03bc it follows that\ng33 = v 2 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere v 2 is the constant given by (18).\nWithout loss of generality we can write the metric as\nds2 = hij (x, y)dxi dxj + v 2 (dy + ai (x)dxi )2 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere the '2D metric' hij depends on all the coordinates x1 , x2 , y. However,\nAi depend only on the xj . This follows from the requirement that v \u03bc is\ntangent to a family of geodesics. Indeed, using v \u03bc \u2207\u03bc v \u03bd = 0, get g \u03bdi \u2202y Ai = 0,\nwhich gives the desired result due to the invertability of hij .\n8\n\n\fIt is important to note here that we have used up most of the freedom we\nhave to choose coordinates. Given a fixed vector field v \u03bc , the form of the metric is preserved by only two restricted types of coordinate transformations.\nFirstly:\ny \u2192 y + f (x)\n(31)\nwhich effects a gauge transformation on the vector field ai (x):\nai (x) \u2192 ai (x) + \u2202i f (x)\n\n(32)\n\nSecondly, we can do y-independent coordinate transformations on the xi .\nThis means that we cannot transform away any y-dependence in the metric\nhij .\nNote that the form of the metric (30) suggests that v \u03bc is a Killing vector\nfor the full metric. Indeed a straightforward calculation shows that the i, j\ncomponents of the Killing equation on v \u03bc\n\u2207i vj + \u2207j vi = \u1e23ij\n\n(33)\n\nwhere we have defined the quantity \u1e23ij := hij,y . The other components vanish\nidentically. This shows as one might expect that v \u03bc is a Killing vector if and\nonly if h is independent of y.\nWe have yet to impose the condition \u2207\u03bc v \u03bc = 0 which is equivalent to\nhij \u1e23ij = 0,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere i, j, ... indices are lowered and raised by hij and its inverse matrix hij .\nThis means of course that h = det(hij ) is independent of y.\nAt this stage we have effectively solved the Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations. The only remaining field equations are the Einstein equations (19),\nwhich in terms of the h 'metric' reduce to\n\u0011\n1\nv2 \u0010\n\u2212\u01ebH c2 + e2 v 4 = 0;\nEyy := \u2212 \u1e23ij \u1e23ij +\n4\n2\n\nEiy :=\n\n1\n1\n\u2207j \u1e23i j \u2212 aj \u2202y \u1e23i j + ai \u1e23jk \u1e23jk\n2\n2\n2 \u0010\n\u0011\nv\n+\n\u2212\u01ebH c2 + e2 v 4 ai = 0;\n2\n\u0014\n\n9\n\n(35)\n\n\u0015\n\n(36)\n\n\f!\n\u0011\n\u0010\nv 2 ij\nh Eij := R(h)+\u2207k (\u1e23 ai )+ak \u2207i \u1e23 \u2212ak ai \u1e27 \u22122\u01ebF v + 1 \u2212 h ai aj \u2212\u01ebH c2 + e2 v 4 = 0.\n2\n(37)\nIn the above, the covariant derivative \u2207j is with respect to the 'metric' hij\nand \u1e23i j := hjk \u1e23ik , etc. Note that the first term in 35 is positive definite,\nwhich in turn requires the second term to be negative definite. Moreover, if\nv \u03bc is a Killing vector, so that h \u0307i j = 0, \u01ebH and \u01ebF must be of opposite sign.\nThe considerations so far are completely general. In the next section show\nhow the Thurston geometries emerge for restricted values of the parameters\nin the Lagrangian.\nij\n\n5\n\nki\n\nki\n\nki\n\n2\n\nExistence of three Killing Vector fields\n\nSo far, for the case of constant dilaton field, we have not been able to prove\nthat the only solutions to the equations of motion have metrics that are\ndiffeomorphic to the eight Thurston geometries. However, in the case e = 0,\ni.e. no Chern-Simons contribution, one can show that the solutions all admit\nat least three algebraically independent Killing vector fields. This is sufficient\nto show that the metrics are homogeneous, and hence diffeomorphic to one\nof the Thurston geometries. To demonstrate this, we will use a procedure for\nexamining the integrability of the Killing equations developed by Eisenhart\n[20], [21] and Yano [22].\nWe begin with the set of twelve variables S := {\u03be\u03bc , \u03be\u03bc\u03bd }. We impose on\nthese variables the set of nine constraints\nF0 := {\u03be\u03bc\u03bd = \u03be\u03bd\u03bc , \u2202\u03bc (v * \u03be) = 0}\n\n(38)\n\nwhere v * \u03be := g\u03bc\u03bd v \u03bc \u03be \u03bd .\nNow the system of partial differential equations that are to be satisfied\nby the variables S, subject to the constraints F0 , are\n\u2207\u03bc \u03be\u03bd = \u03be\u03bc\u03bd ;\n\u2207\u03bc \u03be\u03bd\u03c1 = R\u03bd\u03c1\u03bc\u03c0 \u03be \u03c0 .\n\n(39)\n\nThe latter set is obtained by differentiating the former and using the first\nset of constraints along with the Ricci and Bianchi identities, as shown in\n[22], and also in [23], for the case when the constraint set includes only the\nfirst, enforcing the symmetry of \u03be\u03bc\u03bd . The other constraint in F0 is already\n10\n\n\fintegrable. Now it is shown in [22] that the integrability of Eq.(39) is the set\nof equations\nF1 := {L\u03be R\u03bc\u03bd = 0} .\n(40)\nWe now show that these integrability conditions are identically satisfied as\nlong as e = 0.\nWe write the field equations for the metric as\nR\u03bc\u03bd = ag\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u01ebF v\u03bc v\u03bd ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere a := \u01ebH c2 /2 + \u01ebF v 2 , with v 2 =constant. We also use the MaxwellChern-Simons equations (14). Then it is straightforward to show that\nL\u03be R\u03bc\u03bd = aL\u03be g\u03bc\u03bd + v\u03bc L\u03bd + v\u03bd L\u03bc ,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere the vector field L\u03bc is defined as\nL\u03bc := \u2207\u03bc (g\u03bd\u03c1 \u03be \u03bd v \u03c1 ) + e\u01ebF \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03be \u03bd v \u03c1 .\n\n(43)\n\nSo if e = 0, both terms in Eq.(42) vanish by the constraints F0 .\nBy standard theorems in partial differential equations [20] we can express\nthe variables in the set S as a convergent multivariable Taylor series containing twelve parameters determined from the values of the fields at the centre\nof the Taylor expansion. But the nine constraints then reduce the number of\nindependent parameters to three. Hence, our fields \u03be\u03bc are a three parameter\nfamily of Killing vector fields. This is the result we were after.\nFor the e 6= 0 case, it is straightforward to show that if v\u03bc is a Killing\nvector field, then the metric admits a four parameter family of isometries.\nThis follows from a result in Bona and Coll [24] that if the Ricci tensor\nsatisfies the condition given by the field equation Eq.(41) and in addition v\u03bc\nis shear-free, then the metric necessarily admits a four-parameter isometry\ngroup. It is easy to see that the condition that v\u03bc is Killing is equivalent to it\nbeing shear-free. There are in fact three solutions with e 6= 0 and v\u03bc a Killing\nvector field. Two of these are precicely the Thurston geometries Nil and\nSL(2, R). The third is a twisted line or circle bundle over S 2 , with isometry\ngroup the product of SO(3) with the group of translations on the fibre. So\nlocally these geometries are Hopf fibrations of the squashed (topological)\nthree-sphere. This geometry, which forms the boundary of Taub-Nut-AdS\nand Taub-Bolt-AdS space, has recently been studied in the context of the\nholographic principle[25].\n11\n\n\fSo if the theory admits any solutions which are not homogeneous geometries, then those geometries have e 6= 0 and v\u03bc is not a Killing vector field.\nIn the context of the field equations [34,35-37], this requires solutions with\nboth \u1e23ij and ai non-vanishing. The system appears to be overconstrained,\nand the only such solution we have found corresponds to Sol for which e = 0.\n\n6\n\nLetting it Flow\n\nWe will describe here the flow suggested by our three dimensional gravity\ntheory.4 The idea is that the right side of the flow has as its zeroes the\nsolutions of the equations of motion Eqs.(8) to Eqs.(10):\n\u0121\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u1e02\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u0226\u03bc =\n\u03c6\u0307 =\n\n\u01ebH\n\u22122 R\u03bc\u03bd + 2\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03c6 + \u2212 H\u03bc\u03c1\u03c4 H\u03bd \u03c1\u03c4 \u2212 \u01ebF F\u03bc \u03c1 F\u03bd\u03c1\n4\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22122\u03c6 \u03c1\n\u2207\u03c1 e H \u03bc\u03bd ;\n\u0011\n\u0010\ne\u01ebF \u03bd\u03c1\n\u03b7\u03bc F\u03bd\u03c1 ;\n\u2207\u03bd e\u22122\u03c6 F\u03bc \u03bd +\n2\n\u01ebH\n\u01ebF\n\u2212\u03c7 + R(g) + 4\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 4|\u2207\u03c6|2 \u2212 H 2 \u2212 F 2 .\n12\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n;\n\n(44)\n(45)\n(46)\n(47)\n\nOne needs to first specify the values of the parameters in the set {\u03c7, e, \u01ebH },\naccording to the topology of the 3-manifold. If the manifold has the topology\nof a Seifert bundle \u03b7 over an orbifold Y , we specify \u01ebH = +1, \u03c7 = \u03c7(Y ), e =\ne(\u03b7). If it is not a Seifert bundle then \u01ebH = \u22121. It is not clear what the\ntopological significance is of the parameters \u03c7, e for this case. So far, we\nhave not found a topological interpretation for the parameter \u01ebF . However,\nwe note in Table 1, that \u01ebF always has the opposite sign of either \u01ebH or \u03c7.\nHence we tentatively suggest that \u01ebF has the opposite sign of \u03c7(Y ), if the\nmanifold is a Seifert bundle with \u03c7(Y ) 6= 0; otherwise choose its sign to be\nopposite that of \u01ebH .\nOnce the parameters (and hence topology) are specified, one begins with\nan arbitrary configuration of metric, dilaton field, 2-form potential B\u03bc\u03bd and\nU(1) potential A\u03bc as initial conditions for the flow equations (44-47). If the\n4\n\nThe flow equations below, when the field A\u03bc is turned off, are the RG flow for a nonlinear sigma model coupled to the target space metric g\u03bc\u03bd and two-form potential B\u03bc\u03bd [26].\nWe are currently exploring the incorporation of the target space Maxwell-CS field in the\nsigma model.\n\n12\n\n\fflow is to be useful then in the case where the flow is non-singular, the metrtic\nshould reach the appropriate Thurston geometry.\nAs a consistency check for the program, we consider the case of locally\nhomogeneous initial conditions for the flow. It should be noted that the\nRicci-Hamilton flow of locally homogeneous geometries only converges to the\nfixed points for the case of locally homogeneous and isotropic geometries [27].\nThe anisotropic geometries become degenerate or singular [27].\nWe shall consider a few of the details for the flow of an initial geometry\nwhich is locally H 2 \u00d7 E 1 . Thus the metric, U(1) gauge field and dilaton are\nof the form:\n\u0011\nl2 \u0010\n2\n2\nD\n(t)dx\n+\nD\n(t)dx\n+ E(t)dy 2 ;\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\nx1\nl\nA\u03bc = [0, A(t) , 0];\nx1\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(t).\n\nds2 =\n\n(48)\n\n\u00bfFrom the flow of the metric, we find first that the factor E(t) must be\nconstant, and hence can be absorbed by rescaling the y\u2212 coordinate. Second,\nit turns out that for any value of the flow parameter t, there must be a\nconstant \u03b1 such that D2 (t) = \u03b1D1 (t). The constant \u03b1 can be be absorbed\nby rescaling x2 . Third, the function A(t) in the gauge potential is frozen by\nits flow to be a constant A(t) = a. Finally, we calculate\ndD1\n\u1e0a1 (t)\nD1 (t) (D1 (t) \u2212 a2 )\n:=\n= \u22122 2\n.\nd\u03c6\n(D1 (t) + 2D1 (t) \u2212 a2 )\n\u03c6\u0307(t)\n\n(49)\n\nThe solution is\n\u00111+a2\n\u0010\n1\n\u03c6(D1 ) = \u03c60 \u2212\nD1 + log D1 \u2212D1 + a2\n2\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n.\n\n(50)\n\nHence we find that D1 \u2192 a2 , in the limit \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e. Similar behaviour occurs\nfor the case of the locally homogeneous flow of S 2 \u00d7 E 1 . This is already an\nimprovement over the normalized Ricci flow (see below), since in the latter,\nthe locally homogeneous flow is singular in these cases.\nThe above calculation suggests that the dilaton field \u03c6, 'normalizes' the\nflow and can in some sense be considered as the physical flow parameter.\nIf we had solved the locally homogeneous flows for D1 , D2 , \u03c6 in terms of t,\nwe would have found that the first two do not converge to a finite value as\n13\n\n\ft \u2192 \u221e. Instead, the fields flow to their fixed points as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In the usual\nRicci flow, the locally homogeneous and isotropic geometries do not converge\nto their global 'round' form in the limit t \u2192 \u221e. To accomplish this, the flow\nis normalized by adding to it a term 2/3rg\u03bc\u03bd , where r is the average value of\nthe Ricci scalar over the manifold[12, 27]. These considerations suggest the\nidea that occurence of singularities in the flow of the metric is tracked by the\nflow of the dilaton field, instead of the rather arbitrary parameter t.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nThe stringy gravity flow described in the last section is a promising approach\nto proving the Thurston Geometrization Conjecture. We support this claim\nby the following observations:\n\u2022 It is quite closely related to the Ricci flow and its various modifications considered by Hamilton, Perelman and others. Hence the recent\nprogress made by Perelman in resolving the analytical properties of\nthese flows will almost certainly apply to the flow described here.\n\u2022 The parameters that appear in the flow are determined by the topology\nof the 3- manifold. This makes it easier to 'input' the 3-manifold into\nthe flow at the beginning.\n\u2022 All the Thurston geometries are fixed points of the flow. Hence we can\nfollow non- singular flows directly to the Thurston geometries.\n\u2022 The dilaton field in the flow seems to track the singularities in the flow.\nThis should streamline the proceedure of performing surgery on the\nmanifolds in regions where these singularites occur.\nFinally, and more speculatively, we believe that underlying the stringy\nflow is a quantum field theoretic understanding of the Thurston Geometrization Conjecture. In particular, if the stringy gravity on the 3-manifolds are\nthe bulk theory, then the sigma model whose RG flow is the stringy gravity\nequations of motion is its holographical dual theory. Work along these lines\nis in progress.\nAcknowledgments We wish to acknowledge useful discussions with S. Das,\nV. Husain, R. B. Mann, C. Martinez, R. Troncoso, S. Vaidya, J. VazquezPoritz and J.
