The\nlarge numbers of red giants with observed oscillations make it possible to investigate\nthe properties of the sample as a whole: ensemble asteroseismology.\nIn this article we summarise ensemble asteroseismology results obtained from\ndata released by the Kepler Science Team (\u223c150 000 field stars) as presented by Hekker\net al. (2011b) and for the clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6811 and NGC 6819 (Hekker et al.\n2011a) and we discuss the importance of such studies.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nData from the CoRoT (Baglin et al. 2006) and Kepler (Borucki et al. 2009) missions\nreveal that the majority of stars show intrinsic photometric variability. This variability can be caused by, for instance, stellar activity, such as spots; eclipses in multiple\nsystems consisting of stars or star-planet systems; global intrinsic stellar oscillations\nor a combination of phenomena. We are interested in stellar oscillations to study the\ninternal structures of stars.\nStellar oscillations can be stochastically excited in turbulent layers, such as the\nconvective zones in the Sun, low-mass main-sequence stars, subgiants and red-giant\nstars. Indeed in many of these stars, these so-called solar-like oscillations have been observed (see for recent overviews Bedding 2011; Christensen-Dalsgaard 2011; Hekker\n2010). The properties of solar-like oscillations can be understood in terms of their\nasymptotic approximation (Tassoul 1980), which predicts that acoustic oscillation modes\nhave evenly spaced frequencies with large and small separations between modes of the\nsame degree and consecutive radial orders (large separation, \u2206\u03bd) or modes of differ1\n\n\f2\n\nS. Hekker et al.\n\nent degrees (small separations). The oscillations are centred around the frequency of\nmaximum oscillation power (\u03bdmax ). The global oscillation parameters (\u03bdmax and \u2206\u03bd)\ncan be used to derive the stellar masses and radii from scaling relations (Kjeldsen &\nBedding 1995). Although these masses and radii are not as accurate and precise as can\nbe obtained from grid-based models (Gai et al. 2011), which take stellar evolution into\naccount, these are valuable parameters for ensemble studies as discussed here.\nAs well as the ability to determine fundamental stellar parameters in a relatively\nstraightforward way, a large sample of stars needs to be observable for ensemble studies. All stars in the mass range between roughly 0.8 and 6 solar masses go through\na red-giant phase and the stars in this phase are intrinsically bright. Hence, many red\ngiants are observable in the apparent magnitude volume to which both CoRoT and Kepler are sensitive. Furthermore, the oscillations in these stars have periods of the order\nof a few hours to days, which results in frequencies below the Nyquist frequencies of\nboth instruments. Therefore, all the prerequisites for ensemble asteroseismology are\navailable.\nIn this article we summarise the results on ensemble asteroseismology obtained by\nHekker et al. (2011a,b) and discuss the importance of such studies.\n2.\n2.1.\n\nEnsembles\nField stars\n\nThe Kepler Science Team has released timeseries data for about \u223c150 000 stars selected\non the basis of allowing planets of 2 REarth in an orbit as close as 5 Rstar to be detected\nif transiting these stars (Batalha et al. 2010). Among these stars \u223c17 000 are red-giant\nstars (Ciardi et al. 2010; Hekker et al. 2011b). In this article data from the first month\n(run Q1) of science operation have been used together with effective temperatures from\nground-based multi-colour photometery available in the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC,\nBrown et al. 2011).\n2.2.\n\nClusters\n\nThere are four clusters in the Kepler field of view: NGC 6791, NGC 6811, NGC 6819\nand NGC 6866. NGC 6791 is one of the oldest, most massive and most metal-rich\nopen clusters known (Origlia et al. 2006; Carretta et al. 2007; Anthony-Twarog et al.\n2007) and has been studied extensively. The ages proposed for NGC 6791 range from\n7 to 12 Gyr (see e.g., Basu et al. 2011; Grundahl et al. 2008). In addition, there are\nfour independent studies available to determine the metallicity of this cluster, which\nrange from +0.29 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 +0.45 (Carraro et al. 2006; Origlia et al. 2006; AnthonyTwarog et al. 2007; Brogaard et al. 2011). NGC 6819 is a very rich open cluster with\nroughly solar metallicity of [Fe/H] = +0.09 \u00b1 0.03 (Bragaglia et al. 2001), an age of\nabout 2.5 Gyr (Kalirai et al. 2001; Kalirai & Tosi 2004) and reddening E(B \u2212 V) = 0.15.\nNGC 6811 is a young, sparse, not particularly well studied cluster. Studies on this\ncluster tended to focus on membership or variability of stars and no direct metallicity\nstudies are available. Red giants have been observed in these three clusters. The fourth\nand youngest cluster NGC 6866 has an age of about 0.56 Gyr (Frolov et al. 2010) and\nno red giants have been observed in this cluster.\nFor the clusters we have timeseries data of about two years length at our disposal\nwithin the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC). Although these ensem-\n\n\fEnsemble asteroseismology of red-giant stars\n\n3\n\nbles are much smaller, i.e., 46, 42, and 4 stars for NGC 6791, NGC 6819, NGC 6811 respectively, than the field star sample, the additional information such as common metallicity and age within the clusters allow for an ensemble investigation. The effective\ntemperatures of the cluster stars have been determined using the colour\u2013temperature\ncalibrations by Ram\u0131\u0301rez & Mel\u00e9ndez (2005). See Hekker et al. (2011a) for more details.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nThe analyses of the ensembles described in the previous section led to the following\nmain conclusions:\n3.1.\n\nField stars\n\nFrom the nearly 12 000 red giants for which oscillations have been detected some specific stages of stellar evolution could be identified as shown in the diagrams in Fig. 1\n(see also Hekker et al. 2011b):\n\u2022 The majority of stars with 25 \u03bcHz < \u03bdmax < 45 \u03bcHz with masses roughly below\n2 M are known to be He-core burning stars that have gone through the Helium\nflash. These stars have radii of \u223c10 R and log L/L of \u223c2 and are the so-called\nred-clump stars (see e.g., Miglio et al. 2009; Huber et al. 2010; Kallinger et al.\n2010; Mosser et al. 2011b, for previous detections of the red clump).\n\u2022 The majority of stars with radii below \u223c7.5 R have low luminosities and lie\nbelow the black dashed line in the H-R diagram (panel G in Fig. 1). These are\nlow-luminosity red-giant branch stars.\n\u2022 At \u03bdmax < 25 \u03bcHz a group of stars with low effective temperatures is present (see\npanel B in Fig. 1). These stars also have relatively high luminosities (see panel\nD) and large radii (see panel C), and low to intermediate masses (see panel A).\nThese stars could be high-luminosity red-giant branch stars or asymptotic giant\nbranch stars.\n\u2022 There is some evidence for a secondary clump. Stars with masses roughly between 2 and 3 M and radii between 7.5 and 10 R seem to form a separate\nbranch in the mass versus radius diagram with slightly increased temperatures\n(panel F in Fig. 1). These stars are also visible in the \u03bdmax versus \u03bdmax /\u2206\u03bd diagram at the expected location of the secondary clump (Girardi 1999; Huber et al.\n2010; Kallinger et al. 2010). These are stars in their He-burning phase, which\nare massive enough to have ignited He-burning in a non-degenerate core. These\nstars are secondary-clump stars.\n\u2022 The high-mass stars (\u2265 3.5 M ) form a distinct group of stars at high \u03bdmax /\u2206\u03bd\nand \u03bdmax values similar to the red-clump stars (see panel A of Fig. 1). These stars\nalso have large radii and high luminosities.\n\n\f4\n\nS.

The gray symbols indicate NGC 6819 shifted to the\npositions of NGC 6791 and NGC 6811 (metallicity of \u22120.7 dex), respectively. The\ndashed line roughly indicates the red-giant branch of NGC 6819. The dashed-dotted\nline indicates the position of the red-giant branch of NGC 6819 when only the mass\ndifference with NGC 6811 is taken into account. The dashed-dotted-dotted-dotted\nline illustrates the position of the red-giant branch of NGC 6819 when the mass\ndifference with NGC 6811is considered and a metallicity of \u22120.35 dex for NGC 6811\nis assumed. Figure taken from Hekker et al. (2011a).\n\n3.2.\n\nClusters\n\nFrom the global asteroseismic parameters and derived stellar parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, mass, and radius) of red giants in the three open clusters\nNGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 6811 the following could be concluded (see also\nHekker et al. 2011a):\n\u2022 Mass has a significant influence on the \u2206\u03bd - \u03bdmax relation, while the influence\nof metallicity is negligible, under the assumption that the metallicity does not\ninfluence the excitation / damping of the oscillations. This has been predicted\nfrom models (A. Miglio and T. Kallinger, private communication), but now also\nclearly shown in observed data.\n\u2022 It is well known that both mass and metallicity have an influence on the position\nof stars in the H-R diagram. The different positions of the old metal-rich cluster\nNGC 6791 and the middle-aged solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819 can indeed\nbe explained by the observed differences in metallicity and mass. For NGC 6811,\nwith currently unknown metallicity, a metallicity of about \u22120.35 dex is needed\nto explain the position if the observed stars are He-core burning red-clump stars.\nHowever, if these stars are H-shell burning stars ascending the red-giant branch,\nthe location of the stars in the H-R diagram can only be explained when the\ncluster has a subsolar metallicity of about \u22120.7 dex, see Fig. 2.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nResults from ensemble asteroseismology as discussed here and in various other works\n(e.g., De Ridder et al. 2009; Miglio et al. 2009; Chaplin et al. 2011; Bedding et al. 2011)\n\n\f6\n\nS. Hekker et al.\n\nhave shown to be of prime importance for asteroseismology. Stars have been observed\nin many varieties in terms of their stellar parameters, such as metallicity, rotation, mixing, magnetic fields etc. and in different evolutionary phases. Often, it remains difficult\nto determine whether an individual star under investigation is a 'typical' example or a\nspecial case. In an ensemble study the few special cases will not get a lot of attention,\nbut it becomes possible to investigate the behaviour of a particular group of stars with\nsimilar properties. Furthermore, results of in-depth studies of individual stars are in\nmany cases model dependent. This model dependence does not disappear by a homogeneous study of an ensemble, but when comparing different ensembles one can draw\nconclusions based on the relative values of parameters.\nSome recent examples of breakthrough results from ensemble asteroseismology\nof red-giant stars are the unambiguous detection non-radial oscillations (De Ridder\net al. 2009), which opened the possibility to study the internal structures of these stars.\nHowever, stars in the H-shell burning phase (ascending the red-giant branch) and in the\nHe-core burning phase (red clump) can have similar masses and radii, and it remained\ndifficult to identify the evolutionary state of a particular star. The location in the HR diagram for different evolutionary states determined from a statistically significant\nensemble of stars as summarised in this article increased the probability with which the\nevolutionary state of a particular star could be determined. More recently, oscillation\nmodes that are sensitive to the core have been detected (Beck et al. 2011) and ensemble\nstudies have shown that the period spacing between these modes for stars ascending the\nred-giant branch and in the red clump are significantly different (Bedding et al. 2011;\nMosser et al. 2011a). This is a major breakthrough and an excellent example of the\nbenefits of ensemble asteroseismology: the meaning of the relative values of the period\nspacings became clear in an ensemble study.\nThe general behaviour of a particular ensemble can also be used to investigate\nother parameters. The investigation of the metallicity of NGC 6811 with respect to\nthe metallicity of NGC 6819 as discussed here is an example of that. Other studies\nhave focussed on for instance population studies (e.g., Miglio et al. 2009; Chaplin et al.\n2011). Miglio et al. (2009) showed that based on an ensemble of stars observed with\nCoRoT a constant star formation rate in our galaxy is more likely than a recent star\nformation burst. This is supported by a similar study of main-sequence stars observed\nwith Kepler (Chaplin et al. 2011).\nEnsemble asteroseismology or ensemble studies in general can be used in a wide\nvariety of applications, such as to distinguish between for instance stars in the thin disk,\nthick disk or the bulge of our galaxy, or between population I and population II stars,\nevolution of stars with or without convective cores in their main-sequence phase etc.\nThese ensemble studies are of prime importance and produce essential and complementary results compared to in-depth studies of individual stars.\nAcknowledgments.
