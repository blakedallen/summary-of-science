Introduction.\nThe goals of quantum cryptography and secure quantum communications [1, 2, 3] can\nbe achieved using various protocols, which were developed and realized [7, 12] in the\npast years on the basis of the quantum entanglement [5, 7] of weak beams and the\nsingle [9, 10] or few photon states [11], mostly by means of adjusting and detecting their\npolarization angles [13].\nAnother method, based on the usage of the two-mode coherently correlated\n(TMCC) beams was proposed recently [6]. In this case the secure cryptographic key\nis generated by the laser shot noise and duplicated through the quantum channel.\nUnlike the single or few photon schemes, which require large numbers of transmission\nreiterations to obtain the statistically significant results, the TMCC beam can be\nintensive enough to make each single measurement statistically significant and thus to\nuse single impulse for each piece of information, and remain cryptographically steady.\nIn this work we analyse the error properties of the secure quantum channels, based\non the TMCC-beams and propose some additions to the TMCC-based cryptographic\nprotocol.\nThe two-mode coherently correlated state is the way we refer to the generalized\ncoherent state in the meaning by Perelomov [4]. Such state can be described by its\n\u00a7 To whom correspondence should be addressed (usenko@univ.kiev.ua)\n\n\fSecure quantum channels with correlated twin laser beams\n\n2\n\npresentation through series by Fock states:\n|\u03bbi =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bbn\n|nni\nI0 (2 |\u03bb|) n=0 n!\n1\n\nq\n\n(1)\n\nHere we use the designation |nni = |ni1 \u2297 |ni2 , where |ni1 and |ni2 stand for the\nstates of the 1st and 2nd modes accordingly, represented by their photon numbers.\nThe states (1) are not the eigenstates for each of the operators separately, but are\nthe eigenstates for the product of annihilation operators:\na1 a2 |\u03bbi = \u03bb |\u03bbi .\n\n(2)\n\nSuch states can also be obtained from the zero state:\n1\n+\n|\u03bbi = q\nI0 (\u03bba+\n1 a2 ) |0i\nI0 (2 |\u03bb|)\n\n(3)\n\nIn this work we assume that two laser beams, which are propagating independently\nfrom each other, correspond to the two modes of the TMCC state. States of beams are\nmutually correlated (surely, the TMCC state can also be represented in another way,\nfor example, as a beam consisting of two correlated polarizations).\n2. Beam measurement\nLet's examine any of the two TMCC beams separately. The intensity of the beam's\nradiation, registered by an observer is proportional to the mean of the N = a+ a operator,\nwhich is the number of the photons in the corresponding mode. The mean observable\nvalues, which characterize the results of the measurements of the beam are:\nD\n\nE\n\nhNi = h\u03bb| a+ a |\u03bbi , N 2 = h\u03bb| a+ aa+ a |\u03bbi\n\n(4)\n\nThese characteristics are squared in field, and thus their mean values don't turn\nto zero (this fact is not specific for the TMCC-states, because the usual non-correlated\nstates and processes, like the heat propagation, show the same properties).\nAssuming the state expression (1) we obtain\nhNi =\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n|\u03bb|2n\n|\u03bb|2n\n1\n1\nn 2 , hN 2 i =\nn2 2\nI0 (2|\u03bb|) n=0 n!\nI0 (2|\u03bb|) n=0\nn!\n\n(5)\n\nThe mean number of registered photons is\nhNi =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nnPn (\u03bb)\n\n(6)\n\nn=0\n\nThe probability of registering n photons depends on the intensity of a beam:\nPn (\u03bb) =\n\n1\n|\u03bb|2n\nI0 (2|\u03bb|) n!2\n\n(7)\n\nAn important feature of this distribution is the quick (proportional to n!2 )\ndecreasing dependence of the registration probability on the photon number.\n\n\fSecure quantum channels with correlated twin laser beams\n\n3\n\nThis circumstance makes the experimental identification of the TMCC-states quite\nconvenient. The distribution of the probability of different photon numbers registration\nalong with the analogous distribution for a usual coherent beam are given at the figure 1.\nOne can see that there are significant differences for the TMCC and the Poisson beam\ndistributions - the TMCC-beam distribution is relatively sharp and narrow.\n\nFigure 1. Probability of different photon numbers registration distribution for the\nTMCC-beam (circles, solid line) and the analogous distribution for a usual coherent\nbeam (squares, dotted line)\n\nTaking into account (7) the expressions for the mean and mean square values of\nthe registered photon numbers (5) turn to:\nhNi =\n\n|\u03bb|2 I1 (2|\u03bb|) D 2 E\n, N = |\u03bb|2\nI0 (2|\u03bb|)\n\n(8)\n\nThe measurements have the statistical uncertainty, caused by quantum fluctuations.\nThis uncertainty can be characterized by the corresponding dispersion:\n\u03c3 2 = hN 2 i \u2212 hNi2\n\n(9)\n\nTaking into account (8) we get the following expression:\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c3 2 = |\u03bb|2 \uf8ed1 \u2212\n\nI1 (2 |\u03bb|)\nI0 (2 |\u03bb|)\n\n!2 \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(10)\n\nThe dependencies of the measurement results uncertainty on the mean photon\nnumber for the TMCC-beam and a usual correlated beam are given at figure 2.\nThe difference between these dependencies can also be used for the TMCC-states\nidentification.\n3. Communication via quantum channel\nLet we have to establish a secure quantum channel between two parties (figure 3). Alice\nhas the laser on her side, which produces two beams in the TMCC state. The optical\nchannel is organized in such a way, that Alice receives one of the modes, the first, for\n\n\fSecure quantum channels with correlated twin laser beams\n\n4\n\n5\n4\n\n\u03c33\n2\n1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n<n>\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFigure 2. The dependencies of the measurement results uncertainty on the mean\nphoton number for the TMCC-beam (solid line) and a usual coherent beam (dotted\nline)\n\nexample, i.e. \u03c6A \u2261 \u03c61 ,\u03c6A (xA , t0 ) = 1 , and Bob receives another one, i.e. \u03c6B \u2261 \u03c62\n,\u03c6B (xB , t0 ) = 1 at any moment of measurement t0 , where xA and xB are Alice's and\nBob's locations respectively. Accordingly, Alice cannot measure the Bob's beam and\nvice versa:\u03c6B (xA , t0 ) = 0, \u03c6A (xB , t0 ) = 0. At that the vector-potential of the TMCCbeam is:\n\u2217\n+\nA = \u03c6\u2217A (x, t)a+\nA + \u03c6A (x, t)aA + \u03c6B (x, t)aB + \u03c6B (x, t)aB\n\n(11)\n\nUnlike the usual non-correlated coherent states, which show their quasiclassical\nproperties in the fact, that the mean value of a vector-potential of a corresponding beam\nis not equal to 0, the mean value of a vector-potential of a TMCC-beam and any other\ncharacteristic, which is linear in field, turns to be equal to 0, because during the averaging\nby the 1st mode, for example, the a1 converts |n, ni to |n \u2212 1, ni, which is orthogonal\nto all the present state terms, so h\u03bbi | ai |\u03bbi i = 0. So the quasiclassical properties\nin their usual meaning are absent in the case of a TMCC-beam. But they become\napparent in the non-zero value of the spatial correlation function, which characterizes\nthe interdependence of the results of measurements taken by Alice and Bob:\ngAB =< NA NB > \u2212 < NA >< NB >\n\n(12)\n\nIt's useful to describe the channel quality by the relative correlation, which is\n\u03c1AB =\n\n< NA NB > \u2212 < NA >< NB >\n\u03c3A \u03c3B\n\n(13)\n\nThe main feature of the TMCC state is that the value \u03c1AB is exactly equal to 1,\nwhile in the case of non-correlated beams we would get \u03c1AB = 0. This means that the\nmeasurements of the photon numbers, obtained by Alice and Bob, each with her/his\nown detector, not only show the same mean values, but even have the same deflection\nfrom the mean values.\nThe laser beam is the semi-classical radiation with well defined phase, but due to\nthe uncertainty principle for the number of photons and the phase of the radiation,\nthere is a large enough uncertainty in the photon numbers, this can be seen from the\n\n\fSecure quantum channels with correlated twin laser beams\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Quantum channel between two parties with a TMCC source\n\ndispersion expression (10). Thus one can observe the noise, which is similar to the shot\nnoise in an electron tube. In the TMCC radiation the characteristics of such noise for\neach of the modes are amazingly well correlated to each other. This fact enables the use\nof such radiation for generation of a random code, which will be equally good received\nby two mutually remote detectors.\n3.1. The protocol\nThe following scheme can be used for the TMCC-based protocol. The laser is set up\nto produce the constant mean number of photons during the session and both parties\nknow this number. At some moment Alice and Bob start the measurements. They\ndetect the number of photons at unit time by measuring the integrated intensity of the\ncorresponding incoming beam. If the number of photons for the specific unit time is\nlarger than the known expected mean (which is due to the shot noise), the next bit of\nthe generated code is considered to have the value \"1\". If the measured number is less\nthan the expected mean, the next bit is considered to be equal to \"0\":\nB=\n\n(\n\n{n \u2264 [< N >]} \u2192 0\n{n > [< N >]} \u2192 1\n\n(14)\n\nUpon the receipt of a sufficient number of bits (the code), both Bob and Alice\ndivide them in half, each obtaining two bit sequences (half-codes). Bob encodes one\nL\nsequence with another, using the \"eXclusive OR\" logical operation (XOR, Bi Bj ),\nand sends this encoded half-code to Alice using any public channel. Alice uses any of\nher half-codes to decode the code she has got from Bob using the same XOR operation.\nShe compares the result of this operation with another of her half-codes. If all the\nbits coincide, this means that Alice and Bob both have the same code, which can be\nused as a cryptographic key for encoding their communication. Otherwise they have to\nrepeat the key generation and transfer procedure and check the channel for the possible\neavesdropping if the procedure fails again.\n\n\fSecure quantum channels with correlated twin laser beams\n\n6\n\nThe stability of the protocol against the basic beam splitting attacks was examined\nin [6] and it was shown that any successful attempt destroys the channel and cancels\nthe key distribution session. Besides the basic listening-in, Eve may carry out a more\nadvanced state cloning eavesdropping attack by detecting the overall photon number\nin the Bob's mode for each upcoming bit and then re-emiting the same number again,\nwhich requires Eve to have the same laser source on her site. Though, due to the laser\nshot noise Eve can't be sure if she is producing exactly the same number of photons, she\ncan set up her laser just to produce some mean photon number. In case she will adjust\nher laser to produce the mean photon number, which is equal to the current photon\nnumber measured in the Bob's mode for a next bit, she may probably be successfull by\nrepeating some bits. But in this case she will change the Bob's measurement results\nditribution. This can be checked by expanding a protocol with a post-measurement\nanalysis of the measurement results, which can be done by both of the trusted parties.\nIt should consist of the comparison of an obtained photon numbers distribution by the\nfrequencies of their detection with the expected one for the known constant mean photon\nnumber value which is actually a task of comparing two numerical arrays The difference\nbetween expected and obtained distributions will reveal a state cloning attempt.\n3.2. Quantum channel error analysis\nLet the parties of the secret key transmission procedure are using the protocol described\nabove, thus they estimate the value of the next bit by comparing the actual registered\nphoton number to the average. The probability of detecting \"0\" bit value then is\n[hN i]\n\nP(0) (\u03bb) =\n\nX\n\nPn (\u03bb)\n\n(15)\n\nn=0\n\nThe noise is present in the channel and it may increase the number of the registered\nphotons. We suppose that the noise is thermal and assume that it may, with some\nprobability, cause an appearance of one and no more than one additional photon in any\nof the modes during the time of a bit detection. We will denote the probability of a\nnoise photon detection as \u01eb and refer to it as the noise factor.\nWe suppose that the channel is qualitative enough to transfer the impulse at the\nrequired distance without losing any single photon, thus errors are possible only due to\nthe appearance of the noise photons.\nAn error, when Alice registers \"0\" bit value and Bob registers \"1\" may occur upon\nthe joint realization of two events. The first is that Alice detects the maximum possible\nnumber of these, corresponding to the \"0\" bit value, which is, according to the proposed\nprotocol, equal to the integer part of hni. The second is that in addition to this number\nBob detects the appearance of a noise photon. The opposite situation, when Alice gets\nthe \"1\" bit value and Bob registers \"0\" is possible when the noise photon was detected\nby Alice, the probability of such error is the same.\n\n\fSecure quantum channels with correlated twin laser beams\n\n7\n\nThe probability of the realization of a state, which consists of the maximum possible\nfor the \"0\" bit value photons and, at the same time, is detected as \"0\", is the relation\nbetween the corresponding probabilities:\nPmax(0) =\n\nP[hN i]\nP[hN i]\n= P[hN i]\nP(0)\nn=0 Pn (\u03bb)\n\n(16)\n\nWe will refer to this probability as to the error factor. So the probability of an\nerror during the bit registration is equal to the product of the noise and error factors:\nPerr(0) (\u03bb) = \u01ebPmax(0)\n\n(17)\n\nOne can easily see that upon the intensity increase the error factor becomes less\nand so the channel tends to a self-correction if the beam gets more intensive.\n4. Conclusions\nCorrelated coherent states of the two-mode laser beam (TMCC states) show interesting\nproperties, which can be used, in particular, for the tasks of the quantum communication\nand cryptography.\nThe TMCC-beams can be identified due to the special form of the registration\nprobabilities distribution for different photon numbers in the corresponding beam and\nthe dependence of the dispersion on the mean photon numbers value.\nOn the one hand, each of the modes looks like a flow of the independent photons\nrather then a coherent beam, since mean values of the operators, which are linear in\nfield, are equal to 0 for each mode separately.\nOn the other hand, the strong correlation between the results of measurements for\neach of the modes takes place. This correlation shows itself in the fact that in each of\nthe modes numbers of photons are the same and even the shot noise shows itself equally\nin the both modes. This enables the use of the TMCC state as the generator and carrier\nof random keys in a quantum channel which is stable against the eavesdropping [6].\nThus, the TMCC-laser generates and transmits exactly the 2 copies of a random key.\nUnlike the single or two-photon schemes, which require large numbers of transmission\nreiterations to obtain the statistically significant results, the TMCC beam can be\nintensive enough to make each single measurement statistically significant and thus to\nuse single impulse for each piece of information, and remain cryptographically steady.\nThis allows to essentially increase the effective data transfer rate and distance. Analysis\nof the noise influence on the channel properties shows that the channel tends to a selfcorrection upon the beam intensity increase.\nReferences\n[1] Nicolas Gisin, Gregoire Ribordy, Wolfgang Tittel, Hugo Zbinden.
