BOX 5000, Upton, NY, USA.\nAbstract. Experimental highlights of the RHIC program are reviewed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRelativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a unique environment to study matter under\nextreme conditions of high temperature and energy density. RHIC (Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY provides us with\nsuch collisions. Since the beginning of the RHIC operation in the year 2000, RHIC has\n\u221a\nprovided us not only with Au+Au collisions at the top energy of sNN = 200 GeV, but\nalso at 62 GeV. RHIC has also provided collisions of lighter systems such as Cu+Cu at\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsNN = 200, 62, and 22.5 GeV, and finally the p + p and d+Au collisions at sNN = 200\nGeV that were used as references.\nThe amount of data obtained so far is as overwhelming as the results. I will try to\nsummarize where we are, with RHIC RUNV just about to start.\n\nELLIPTIC FLOW\nIn non-central collisions the initial spatial anisotropy is transformed into an anisotropy\nin momentum-space if sufficient interactions occur among the constituents within the\nsystem. Once the system has expanded enough to quench the spatial anisotropy, further\ndevelopment of momentum anisotropy ceases. This self-quenching process happens\nquickly, so elliptic flow is primarily sensitive to the early stages of the collisions [1].\n\nHydrodynamics\nThe elliptic flow v2 as a function of pt for KS0 , \u039b, \u03c6 , \u039e, and \u03a9 is depicted in Fig. 1\n[2, 3]. The \u03c6 , \u039e, and \u03a9 have low hadronic cross-sections, therefore the large v2 observed\nsuggest that the elliptic flow is built up in the partonic stage. The expected range of v2\nfrom hydrodynamic calculations is also shown in Fig. 1. A more detailed comparison\ncan be seen in Fig. 2 (left panel), where the mass dependence hydrodynamic results [1]\nare compared to the v2 measurements of \u03c0 , K, p, and \u039b [4]. Hydrodynamics describes\nwell the mass dependence observed in the data that is characteristic of a common flow\nvelocity. Since an ideal hydrodynamic fluid is a thermalized system with a zero mean\n\n\fv2\n\nSTAR preliminary\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c6\n\nK0S\n\u039b+\u039b\nHydro\n\n-\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n+\n\n\u039e +\u039e\n+\n\u03a9 +\u03a9\n\n6 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nTransverse Momentum p (GeV/c)\nT\n\nFIGURE 1.

The dashed lines show a common fit to\nthe KS0 and \u039b + \u039b data [5]. The shaded areas are hydrodynamic calculations [1]\n\nfree path that yields to the maximum possible v2 , the good agreement between the\nmeasured v2 and the hydro results [1] suggests thermalization in heavy-ion collisions\nat RHIC.\n\nConstituent Quark Scaling\nWhile hydrodynamic calculations keep increasing as a function of pT , the measured\nv2 saturate at pT > 2 GeV/c [2]. The saturation value for mesons is about 2/3 of that for\nbaryons. This separation pattern holds for \u03c0 , K, \u039b, and \u039e, and seems to hold for \u03c6 and\n\u03a9 [3, 6]. This result and the baryon-meson splitting of the high pT suppression pattern\n[7] suggest the relevance of the constituent quark degrees of freedom in the intermediate\npT region [8]. v2 scaled by the number of valence quarks n as a function of pT /n is\ndepicted in Fig. 2 (right panel). The lower panel of Fig. 2 (right panel) displays the ratio\nbetween the measurements and a polynomial fit to all the data. At low pT /n the observed\ndeviations from the fit follow a mass ordering which is expected from hydrodynamics. At\nhigher pT , all v2 /n measurements are reasonably close to unity showing the constituent\nquark scaling.\n\nFREEZE-OUT PROPERTIES\nThe measured particle spectra and yields [9] and event-by-event hpT i fluctuations [10]\nindicate a nearly chemically and kinetically equilibrated system at the final freeze-out\nstage.\n\n\fPolynomial Fit\n\nSTAR Data\n\n0.06\n\n0.05\n\n\u03c0++\u03c0-\n\np+p\n\u039b+\u039b\n\n0\nKS\n+\n\nK +K\n\n-\n\n+\n\n\u039e +\u039e\n-\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\nHydrodynamic results\n\u03c0\nK\np\n\u039b\n\n0.02\n0\n\n\u03c0\u00b1 systematic error\n\n-0.02\n-0.02\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nData/Fit\n\nv2\n\n0.08\n\nv2/n\n\n\u03c0\u00b1\nKS0\n\u2212\np\n\u2212\n\u039b+\u039b\n\n0.1\n\nSTAR preliminary\n\n0.12\n\n1\n0.5\n\n1.6\n0\n\nTransverse momentum pt (GeV/c)\n\n1\n\n2\n\npT/n (GeV/c)\n\nFIGURE 2. Left panel: v2 as a function of pt from minimum bias Au+Au collisions [4] measured by\nSTAR. The dotted-dashed lines are hydrodynamic calculations using an equation of estate (EOS) with a\nfirst-order hadron quark-gluon plasma phase transition [1]. The description of the data worsen if a hadronic\nEOS is used [1]. Right panel: Measurements by STAR of the scaled v2 (pT /n)/n for identified hadrons\n(upper panel) and the ratio between the measurements and a polynomial fit through all data points (lower\n\u221a\npanel) except the pions for sNN = 200 GeV minimum bias Au+Au collisions [2].\n\nChemical and Kinetic Freeze-out Parameters\n\u221a\nSTAR has now measured hadron distributions at sNN = 200 and 62 GeV [11,\n12]. Chemical freeze-out properties were extracted from stable particle ratios within\nthe thermal model [15]. The extracted chemical freeze-out temperature Tch and the\nstrangeness suppression factor \u03b3s are depicted in Fig. 3. Kinetic freeze-out properties\nfrom particle pT distributions were extracted within the blast wave model [16]. Figure\n4 displays the extracted kinetic freeze-out temperature Tkin and the average radial flow\n\u221a\nvelocity h\u03b2T i. The results at sNN = 62 GeV are found to be qualitatively the same as\n\u221a\nthose obtained at sNN = 200 GeV and resonance decays are found to have no significant\neffect on the extract kinetic freeze-out parameters [12].\nTch is independent of centrality. Tkin obtained from \u03c0 , K, and p decreases as a function\nof centrality, while the corresponding h\u03b2T i increases. This is evidence that the system\nexpands between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs, which brings the system to a lower\ntemperature. The constant Tch suggests that hadronic scatterings from hadronization to\nchemical freeze-out may be negligible because they would result in a dropping Tch .\n\u03b3s increases from p + p to peripheral and central Au+Au collisions. In central Au+Au\ncollisions, \u03b3s is \u223c1 suggesting that strangeness is saturated. The Tch of \u03c6 , \u039e, and \u03a9 is\nhigher than that of \u03c0 , K, and p, while the h\u03b2T i is lower. Noting that the \u03c6 , \u039e, and \u03a9\nhave small hadronic cross-sections, they may chemically and kinetically freeze-out at\nthe same time.\n\n3\n\n\f\u03b3s\n\nTch (MeV)\n\n200\n1\n\n150\n0.5\n\n200 GeV (\u03c0, K, p, \u039b, \u039e)\n\n200 GeV (\u03c0, K, p, \u039b, \u039e)\n\n62.4 GeV (\u03c0, K, p, \u039b, \u039e)\n\n62.4 GeV (\u03c0, K, p, \u039b, \u039e)\n\n100\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n<Npart>\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n<Npart>\n\nFIGURE 3.

STAR measurements.\n\nSYSTEM SIZE DEPENDENCE\nThe comparison between the charged hadron pseudorapidity distributions measured\nby PHOBOS [13] in Cu+Cu and Au+Au with similar number of participants N part is\npresented in Fig. 5. Both distributions are comparable within errors, showing that bulk\nparticle production depends mainly on the number of participating nucleons. The same\n\u221a\nis true for different N part and also at sNN = 62 GeV [13]. Many other measurements\nfrom BRAHMS, PHENIX, PHOBOS, and STAR support this argument [20, 30, 13, 7].\n\n\fCu+Cu, Preliminary, 3-6%, Npart = 100\n\ndNch/d\u03b7\n\n200\n\nAu+Au, 35-40%, N part = 99\n\n150\n100\n50\nPHOBOS, s = 200 GeV\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n\u03b7\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIGURE 5. Charged hadron pseudorapidity measured by PHOBOS for Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions\n\u221a\nat sNN = 200 GeV with similar number of participants N part\n\nLOW PT HADRONS\nThe nuclear modification factor RAA of \u03c0 and p measured at y = 3.2 by BRAHMS\nand y = 0 by PHENIX in central Au+Au collisions does not depend on rapidity [20],\nsuggesting that the same mechanisms is responsible for the nuclear modifications. It has\nbeen predicted [21] that the magnitude of jet quenching should depend on both the size\nand the density of the created absorbing medium. The averaged pion RAA as a function\nof N part for both forward rapidity and mid-rapidity are shown in Fig. 6. The average\nwas performed in the interval 2 < pT < 3 GeV/c. The mid- and forward rapidity pion\nsuppression for the most central Au+Au collisions are found to be the same magnitude.\nHowever, the RAA measured in forward rapidity shows significantly stronger rise towards\nperipheral collisions as compared to RAA at mi-rapidity, differing on the level of 35% for\nhN part i \u2248 100. This is consistent with the model of parton energy loss in a strongly\nabsorbing medium [22, 23]. In this picture, at mid-rapidity, the emission is dominated\nby the emission from the surface which quenches the dependence of RAA on the system.\nOn the other hand, at forward rapidities, the transition from surface to volume emission\ncan occur, which leads to a stronger dependence on the number of participants.\n\nINTERMEDIATE PT HADRONS\nIntermediate pT (pT < 6 GeV/c) protons behave differently than mesons at heavy-ion\ncollisions [6]. This behavior can be seen in Fig. 7 (left panel) that depicts the ratio of p to\n\u03c0 spectra measured by STAR in both central Au+Au collisions and in p + p collisions.\nThe large enhancement of the p/\u03c0 ratio at intermediate pT in Au+Au collisions indicates\nthat jet fragmentation in vacuum is not the dominant source of particle production in\n\n\f1.4\n\nRAA averaged in p from 2.0 to 3.0 GeV/c\nT\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c00 PHENIX\n\u03c0++\u03c0y \u2248 3.2\nBRAHMS preliminary\n2\ny=0\n\nRAA\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.4\n0.2\n00\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n<Npart > .\n\nFIGURE 6.

An enhancement, roughly peaked at at the same position, is also observed\nin RCP , as shown in Fig. 7 (right panel). Here, RCP is the ratio between central and\nperipheral Au+Au collisions normalized to the binary collision scaling expectation.\nLike v2 [2], RCP also separates into baryons and mesons. The K \u2217 [17], which is a\nmeson with the mass close to the proton mass, follow the behavior of mesons. This\nproves that this separation is not due to the hadron mass. This grouping is violated in\nRAA , where the reference is from p + p collisions rather than peripheral collisions. A\nstrong enhancement in strange baryon RAA with increasing enhancement for increasing\nstrangeness content is observed at intermediate pT [18]. This enhancement is depicted\nin Fig. 8.\n\nHIGH PT HADRONS\nThe suppression of high pT hadrons in central Au + Au collisions was one of the\nunexpected and important phenomena observed at RHIC. The RAA of \u03c0 0 measured by\n\u221a\nPHENIX in central Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV [24] is presented in Fig. 9.\nThe suppression is quite strong (RAA \u223c0.2) and remains approximately flat up to 20\nGeV/c. Partonic radiative energy loss models [25, 26, 27] reproduce this behavior well.\nIn particular, one calculation depicted in Fig. 9 uses an average gluon average density\ndNg /dy \u223c 1200 [25]. The RAA measured by PHENIX and STAR are shown in Fig. 9\n[24] and Fig. 10 [19], respectively. The difference between charged hadrons RAA and the\n\u03c0 0 RAA in the intermediate pT region (pT < 6 GeV/c) is due to the proton contribution\nas observed in Fig. 10 and nicely described by recombination models. This behavior\ndisappears for pT > 6 GeV/c and are also explained by the same recombination models\n[28, 29, 30].\n\n\fSTAR Preliminary\n\nb)\n\nRCP\n\np/\u03c0\n\n1.5\n\nAu+Au, 0-5%\nTPC\nTOF\n\np\n\u039b\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c0\n\nAu+Au 200 GeV\nSTAR Preliminary\n\nK0S\n\n1\n\npp 200 GeV\n\n1\n\n1.4\n\nd+Au 200 GeV\n\nRcp, 0-5%/60-80%\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\npT, GeV/c\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nsNN=200 GeV STAR Preliminary\n\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n\n\u039e+\u039e\n\u039b\np+p (TOF+RICH)\n(h +h+)/2\nK0S\n\u03c6\n\n2\n1.5\nbinary scaling\n\n1\n0.5\nparticipants scaling\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\npT [GeV/c]\n\nFIGURE 7.

The away-side hadron\ntriggered fragmentation functions [26] for d+Au and Au+Au collisions [31] measured\nby STAR as a function of zT = passoc\n/ptrig\nT\nT is depicted in Fig. 12 (left panel). Fig. 12 (left\npanel) shows that the shape of the away-side fragmentation functions is unchanged from\nd+Au to central Au+Au collisions. However, the yields are reduced by a factor of \u223c4\nin central Au+Au collisions. Even though the shape is consistent with previous predictions in the zT range measured, the magnitude is smaller than expected [26].

Contrary to the maximum found in p + p\nand d+Au collisions, STAR measured the hpT i of the associated particles appears to\nbe a minimum at \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0 in central Au+Au collisions [34]. In addition, the awayside associated particle yield is flat or may have a small dip at \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0 [34]. These\nphenomena are displayed in Fig. 12 (right panel) and have led to predictions that we\nmay be observing jets that have been deflected by radial flow or a Mach cone effect\nassociated with conical shock waves [35].\n\nHEAVY FLAVOR\nThe nuclear modification factor RAA of non-photonic electrons measured by PHENIX\n[36] and STAR [7] in central Au+Au collisions is shown in Fig. 13. Both experiments\nobserve a very strong suppression of the non-photonic electrons. The suppression has\napproximately the same shape and magnitude as the suppression for hadrons, which is a\nquite surprising result, since the massive quarks are expected to radiate much less energy\nthan the lighter u and d quarks. It is important to confirm and complement these results\nwith direct measurements of open charm and open bottom contributions. The first direct\nreconstruction of D mesons by STAR [37] is the first step in this direction, and more\nimprovement will come with the implementation of new detectors from both PHENIX\nand STAR.\nThe v2 of non-photonic electrons as a function of pT [36] measured by PHENIX is\nshown in Fig. 14 (left panel).

The suppression is clear and within errors it is seems\nto be independent of the collision system. Furthermore, the magnitude of the suppression\nof \u223c3 for the most central collisions is similar to the suppression observed at SPS [41].\nThe left panel of Fig. 15 shows that models that were able to explain the anomalous\nJ/\u03c8 suppression at the SPS and that were based on interactions with comovers [42],\ncolor screening [43], or QCD-inspired in-medium effects [44] predict a stronger suppression at RHIC.\nThe discrepancy seems to be resolved by invoking the regeneration of J/\u03c8 at the\nlater stage of the collision via recombination of c and c\u0304 quarks, which are produced\nmore abundantly at RHIC.

Furthermore, the thermal\nparameters extracted from these particles suggest that they chemically and kinetically\nfreeze-out at the same time.\nIntermediate pT (pT < 6 GeV/c) protons behave differently than mesons at heavyion collisions. The large enhancement of the p/\u03c0 ratio at intermediate pT in Au+Au\ncollisions indicates that jet fragmentation in vacuum is not the dominant source of\nparticle production in this pT range.\nThe suppression of high pT hadrons in central Au + Au collisions was one of the\nunexpected and important phenomena observed at RHIC. The suppression is quite strong\nand remains approximately flat up to 20 GeV/c. Partonic radiative energy loss models\n[25, 26, 27] reproduce this behavior well.\nThe quality of the RHIC data is just marvellous, and the knowledge that this data has\nprovided on the dense matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is without any\ndoubt unexpected. We can only wonder how new data with new detector upgrades will\nsurprise us.\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank F. Laue, R. Longacre, T. Ullrich, Z. Xu, and H.
