In 1992, with completion of the QDOT and 1.2 Jy surveys (Rowan-Robinson\net al. 1990a, Lawrence et al. 1999, Strauss et al. 1990, 1992,\nFisher et al. 1995), and with other large redshift surveys in\nprogress, it became clear that a complete redshift survey of\nthe IRAS Point Source Catalog (the PSC, Beichman et al.\n1984, henceforth ES) had become feasible.\nOur specific targets for the PSCz survey were two-fold:\n(a) we wanted to maximise sky coverage in order to predict\nthe gravity field, and (b) we wanted to obtain the best possible completeness and flux uniformity within well-defined\narea and redshift ranges, for statistical studies of the IRAS\ngalaxy population and its distribution. The availability of\ndigitised optical information allowed us to relax the IRAS\nselection criteria used in the QIGC (Rowan-Robinson et al.\n1990b), and use optical identification as an essential part\nof the selection process. This allowed greater sky coverage,\nbeing essentially limited only by requiring that optical extinctions be small enough to allow complete identifications.\nThe PSC was used as starting material, because of its superior sky coverage and treatment of confused and extended\nsources as compared with the Faint Source Survey (Moshir\net al. 1989). The depth of the survey (0.6 Jy) derives from\nc 0000 RAS\n\nthe depth to which the PSC is complete over most of the\nsky.\nThe topology of the survey is analysed and presented\nby Canavezes et al. (1998); the inferred velocity field by\nBranchini et al. (1999); the real-space power spectrum and\nits distortion in redshift-space by Tadros et al. (1999); the\nredshift-space power spectrum by Sutherland et al. (1999).\nThe direction and convergeance of the dipole has been investigated by Rowan-Robinson et al. (1999), and its implications for cosmological models by Schmoldt et al. (1999).\nSharpe et al. (1999) presented a least-action reconstruction\nof the local velocity field, while an optical/IRAS clustering\ncomparison was presented by Seaborne et al. (1999). Many\nof these results are summarised in Saunders et al. (1999).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE CATALOGUE\nSky coverage\n\nWe aimed to include in the survey all areas of sky with\n(a) reliable and complete IRAS data, and (b) optical extinction small enough to allow reliable galaxy identifications and\nspectroscopic followup. We defined a mask of those parts of\nthe sky excluded from the survey; the final mask was the\nunion of the following areas:\n(i) Areas failing to get 2 Hours-Confirming coverages\n(HCONs, ES III.C.1). In these areas, there is either no data\n\n\f2\n\nW.Saunders et al.\n\nat all or the data does not allow adequate source confirmation.\n(ii) Areas flagged as High Source Density at 12, 25 or\n60\u03bcm. HSD at 12 or 25 implies an impossibly high stellar\ndensity for galaxy identifications. Areas flagged as HSD at\n60\u03bcm were processed differently in the PSC, with completeness sacrificed for the sake of reliability.\n(iii) Areas with I100 > 25 MJy ster\u22121 . The 100\u03bcm intensity values are those of Rowan-Robinson et al. (1991). Above\nthis value, we found the fraction of sources which were identifiable as galaxies dropped dramatically.\n(iv) Areas with extinctions AB > 2m , where secure optical identifications become increasingly difficult. Our extinction estimates were based on the I100 values above, and\nincorporated a simple model for the the variation in dust\ntemperature across the Galaxy; they are discussed further\nin Section 4.3. Except towards the centre and anti-centre,\nthis criterion and the previous one are almost equivalent\n(v) Small patches covering the LMC and SMC, defined\nby I100 > 10 and 5 MJy ster\u22121 respectively. In these areas, there are large numbers of HII regions in the clouds\nthemselves with similar optical and IRAS properties to background galaxies, making identifications very uncertain.\nThe mask is specified as a list of excluded 1 deg2 'lunebins' (ES Ap.X.1), so these values are necessary averages\nover 1 deg2 .\nThe overall area outside the mask is 84% of the sky. For\nstatistical studies of the IRAS galaxy population and its distribution, where uniformity is more important than sky coverage, we made a 'high |b|' mask, as above but including all\nareas with AB > 1m , and leaving 72% of the sky. In practice,\nthis criterion is almost identical to I100 > 12.5 MJy ster\u22121 .\nHenceforth, when we say 'high-latitude', we simply mean\noutside this mask. Both masks are shown in Figure 1.\n\n2.2\n\nPSC selection criteria\n\nOur aim was to relax the criteria of the QIGC sufficiently\nto pick up virtually all galaxies, even at low latitude, purely\nfrom their IRAS properties; simultaneously, we wanted to\nkeep contamination by Galactic sources to a reasonable\nlevel. Our actual colour selection criteria were almost the\nsame as the QIGC:\nlog10 (S60 /S25 )\n> \u22120.3\nlog10 (S25 /S12 )\n<\n1.0\nlog10 (S100 /S25 ) > \u22120.3\nlog10 (S60 /S12 )\n>\n0.0\nlog10 (S100 /S60 ) <\n0.75\nHowever, unlike the QIGC, upper limits were used only\nwhere they guaranteed inclusion or exclusion. We did not at\nthis stage exclude any source solely on the basis of an identification with a Galactic source. Because the PSCz evolved\nfrom the QIGC, there remain in the catalogue 3 galaxies\nwhich actually fail the new selection criteria. In total, we\nselected 16422 sources from the PSC.\nMany very nearby galaxies have multiple PSC sources,\nassociated with individual starforming regions. 70 such\nsources were pruned to leave for each such galaxy, the single,\nbrightest PSC source. Also at this stage, Local Group galaxies were excised from the catalogue, and a separate catalogue\nof far-infrared properties for Local Group galaxies made.\n\n2.3\n\nExtended sources\n\nAll IRAS surveys are bedevilled by the question of how to\ndeal with galaxies which are multiple or extended with respect to the IRAS 60\u03bcm beam. The size of most 60\u03bcm detectors was 1.5\u2032 in-scan by 4.75\u2032 cross-scan. The raw data was\ntaken every 0.5\u2032 , and for the PSC this was then filtered with\nan 8-point zero-sum linear filter, of the form \u2212\u2212++++\u2212\u2212.\nHence galaxies with in-scan far-infrared sizes larger than\nabout 1.5\u2032 , will have their fluxes underestimated in the PSC.\nThere is a lesser sensitivity to cross-scan diameter, caused\nby some of the scans only partially crossing the full width\nexteneded sources.\nThe approach we have settled on is to preferentially\nuse PSC fluxes, except for sources identified with individual galaxies whose large diameters are likely to lead to significant flux underestimation in the PSC. The PSC flux is\nbased on a least chi-squared template fit to the point-sourcefiltered data-stream, so the flux is correctly measured for\nslightly extended sources, with diameters smaller than about\n1.5\u2032 \u22c6 . As far-infrared diameters are typically half optical,\n(e.g. Rice et al. 1988), and optical D25 diameters are typically several times the FWHM for spirals, we can expect\nthat isolated galaxies must have extinction-corrected diameters larger than several arcmin for their fluxes to be badly\nunderestimated by the PSC.\nFluxes for extended sources can be derived using the\nADDSCAN (or SCANPI) software provided at IPAC, which\ncoadds all detector scans passing over a given position. We\nhave tested how the ratio of PSC-to-extended flux depends\non D25 , and, as expected, we find that the ratio is almost\nconstant for galaxies up to 2.5\u2032 (Figure 2), where the addscan\nflux is typically 10% larger. However, we also find that\naddscan fluxes are systematically 5% larger than PSC fluxes,\neven for much smaller galaxies. This discrepancy is not due\nto any difference in calibration (we have tested this by extracting a point-source-filtered flux from the addscan data\nand substituting this for the PSC flux, but the discrepancy\nin Figure 2 remains). The reason is the large number of multiple and/or interacting galaxies seen by IRAS, for which the\naddscan picks up the entire combined flux. Using such combined fluxes throughout is not a consistent approach, since\nnearby interacting galaxies will always be resolved into two\nor more sources, while more distant ones will not be\u2020 . The\neffect of the PSC filter is more subtle: a close pair of galaxies\nunresolved by the IRAS beam will in general have unequal\nfluxes, and in a flux limited survey, at least one will be below\nthe flux limit. In such a situation, the zero-sum linear PSC\nfilter still overestimates the flux of the brightest source on\naverage (because of clustering), but by much less than the\naddscan.\nVery large galaxies will have fluxes underestimated by\nthe addscan, because their cross-scan extent is large compared with the detector size. Fluxes for galaxies with optical\n\u22c6 By comparison, the Faint Source Survey (Moshir et al. 1989)\nfluxes are peak amplitudes of the point-source-filtered data, so\nare much less tolerant of slightly extended sources.\n\u2020 In any survey with unresolved sources, a consistent approach to\nmultiple sources is not possible, except by artificially degrading\nthe resolution for each source to make it the same in physical\nunits as for the most distant.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe PSCz catalogue\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. 15431 PSCz sources identified as possible or definite galaxies, high |b| and default masks in galactic coordinates.\n\ndiameters D25 > 8\u2032 have been taken from Rice et al. (1988),\nwho made coadded maps for each such galaxy. In principal,\ngalaxies somewhat smaller than this may have underestimated fluxes from the addscans. However, we find that, for\nthe 19 PSCz galaxies in Rice et al. with quoted diameters\n8\u2032 \u2212 10\u2032 , the flux differance between addscan and Rice et\nal. fluxes is log10 (S60A /S60R ) = 0.044 \u00b1 0.034, that is the\naddscan fluxes are slightly but not significantly larger; so\nwe do not expect smaller galaxies to have underestimated\naddscan fluxes.\nBearing these points in mind, we proceeded as follows: we made a catalogue, with the same sky coverage\nas the PSCz, of optically-selected galaxies from the LEDA\ndatabase (Paturel et al. 1989) with extinction-corrected D25\ndiameters larger than 2.25\u2032 , where the extinctions were estimated as per Section 4.3, and the consequent corrections\nto the diameters are as given by Cameron (1990). In Saunders et al. (1995), it was argued that LEDA is reasonably\ncomplete to this limit. For the largest sources, we used\nthe positions and fluxes of Rice et al. (1988). IPAC kindly\naddscanned all the remainder for us to provide coadded data.\nWe then used software supplied by Amos Yahil to extract\npositions, fluxes and diameters from this data, on the assumption that the galaxies have exponential profiles. Where\nthese addscan fluxes are used in the catalogue, they have\nbeen arbitrarily decreased by 10%, to bring them statistic 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 2.

Where D25\nis not known, it is set to 0.\n\ncally into line with the PSC fluxes at the 2.25\u2032 switchover.\nWe ended up with 1402 sources associated with large galaxies entering the catalogue, and 1290 PSC sources associated\n\n\f4\n\nW.Saunders et al.\n\nwith large galaxies flagged for deletion. The latter are kept\nin the catalogue, so that a purely IRAS-derived catalogue\ncan be extracted if wanted.\n\n2.4\n\nOther problem sources\n\nIn the QIGC, sources flagged as associated with confirmed\nextended sources, or with poor Correlation Coefficient, or\nflagged as confused, were addscanned. The above prescription should have dealt with the extended sources; the only\nother reasons for a galaxy source to have a poor CC are\nthat (a) it is multiple, and as argued above we prefered PSC\nfluxes in these cases, or (b) it has low S/N, in which case the\nPSC is an unbiased flux estimator, while addscanning risks\nnoise-dependent biases. The confusion flag is set very conservatively (i.e. most sources flagged as confused have sensible\nPSC fluxes) and in any case the PSC in general deals better\nwith confusion than the addscans, in both cross-scan and inscan directions. For these reasons, and to avoid introducing\nany latitude-dependent biases into the catalogue, we opted\nto use PSC fluxes throughout for sources not identified with\noptical galaxies as above. Addscan fluxes are included in\nthe catalogue for all sources for those wishing to experiment\nwith them.\n\n2.5\n\nSupplementary sources\n\nFor a source to be accepted into the PSC, it required successful Hours-Confirmation on two separate HCONS (ES\nV.D.6). Thus at low S/N, areas of the sky with only 2\nHCONS are inevitably less complete than those with 3 or\nmore; the estimated completeness at 0.6\u22120.65 Jy in 2HCON\nareas is only 82% (ES XII.A.4). To improve this completeness, we supplemented the catalogue with 1HCON sources\nsatisfying our colour criteria in the Point Source Catalog Reject File (ES VII.E.1), where there is a corresponding source\nin the Faint Source Survey. We demanded that PSC and FSS\nsources be within each other's 2\u03c3 error ellipse, and that the\nfluxes agree to within a factor of 1.5. This revealed many\nsources in the Reject File where two individual HCON detections had failed to be merged in the PSC processing (ES\nXII.A.3), as well as sources which failed at least one HCON\nfor whatever reason. New sources were created or merged\nwith existing ones, and the Flux Overestimation Parameters (ES XII.A.1) assigned or recalculated accordingly. As\nwell as these 1HCON sources, we also searched in the Reject\nFile for additional sources with flux quality flags 1122 and\n1121 \u2021 ; neither of which category made the PSC. Finally, we\nlooked for sources in the PSC itself with flux quality flags\n1113, but correlation coefficient at 60\u03bcm equal to A,B or\nC indicating a meaningful detection. Altogether we found\nan additional 323 galaxies, mostly in 2HCON regions, and\nmade 143 deletions as a result of merging individual HCON\ndetections.\n\n\u2021 1=upper limit only, 2=moderate quality detection, 3=good detection, in each of the four bands\n\n2.6\n\nOptical identifications\n\nOptical material for virtually all sources was obtained from\nCOSMOS or APM scans, including new APM scans taken\nof 150 low-latitude POSS-I E plates. In general, we used red\nplates at |b| < 10\u25e6 and blue otherwise. The actual categories\nof optical material are:\n1. Uncalibrated POSS-O plates scanned with APM. Here the\nmagnitudes are typically good to 0.5m for faint (B \u223c 19m )\ngalaxies.\n2. SRC J plates scanned with APM. These plates were\nscanned and matched for the APM survey, and have bJ magnitudes typically good to 0.25m for faint galaxies.\n3,4,5. Uncalibrated SRC J or EJ plates scanned with COSMOS, giving bJ accurate to about 0.5m .\n6. SRC SR plates scanned with COSMOS. The quoted magnitudes are r-magnitudes, good to 0.5m .\n7. POSS-E plates scanned with APM. For these plates, the\nstandard POSS-O calibration was assumed. Since the O\nplates are about 1 magnitude deeper than the E plates, while\nB \u2212R \u223c 1 for IRAS galaxies, this gives a reasonable approximation to the B magnitude. When there is extinction, this\nprocedure gives systematically too bright a magnitude by\nabout 0.43AB (assuming Mathis 1990). The scatter is still\ndominated by the 0.5m zero-point error.\nAt bright magnitudes, photographic photometry for\ngalaxies becomes increasingly uncertain because of nonlinearity and saturation in the emulsion.\nThe image parameters from COSMOS and APM data\nwere also used to get arcsecond positions and offsets from\nnearby stars, and to make 'cartoon' representations of the\n4\u2032 \u00d74\u2032 field centred on each IRAS source. The identifications\nwere made using the likelihood methods of Sutherland and\nSaunders (1992). In general, and always at low latitudes,\nthese cartoons were supplemented by grayscale images from\nthe Digital Sky Survey and/or inspection of copy plates, and\nany change in best identification noted.\nAt this stage, non-galaxies were weeded out by a combination of optical appearance, IRAS colours and addscan\nprofiles, VLA 20cm maps from the NVSS survey (Condon\net al. 1998), millimetre data from Wouterlout and Brand\n(1989), SIMBAD and other literature data. Several hundred low-latitude sources were also imaged at K \u2032 , as part\nof the extension of the PSCz to lower latitudes (Saunders et\nal. 1999). We found a total of 1376 confirmed non-galaxies.\nWe are left with 15332 confirmed galaxies, and a further 79\nsources where no optical identification is known but there\nis no clear Galactic identification either. The distribution of\nidentified galaxies and the mask are shown in Figure 1.\nThe Galactic sources are dominated by infrared cirrus\n(774 sources). However, there are also 88 planetary nebulae,\n140 emission-line stars, 24 sources identified with Galactic\nHII regions, 212 sources identified with bright stars or reflection nebulae, and 138 sources associated with YSO's.\n\n3\n\nTHE REDSHIFT SURVEY\n\nAn essential part of the project was maintenance of a large\ndatabase of redshift information from the literature, from\ndatabases such as the NED and LEDA (the NASA and\nLyons Extragalactic Databases) and Huchra's ZCAT, and\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe PSCz catalogue\n\n5\n\nalso work in progress for other surveys. Redshifts were accepted on the basis that their claimed error was better than\nany other available for that source, including our own.\nOf the 15,411 galaxies in the sample, about 8,000 had\nknown redshift at the inception of the project, with about\nanother 2,000 expected to be observed as part of ongoing\nprojects such as the CfA2 and SSRS surveys. The project\nwas fortunate enough to be allocated 6 weeks of INT+FOS\ntime, 1 week INT+IDS, 6 nights AAT+FORS time, 18\nnights on the CTIO 1.5m, two weeks at the INAOE 2.1m and\n120 hours at Nan\u00e7ay radiotelescope, over a total of 4 years.\n4600 redshifts were obtained in this time. For the INT+IDS\nand CTIO spectra, redshift determination was made from\nthe average observed wavelengths of the H\u03b1 , NII and SII\nfeatures. The rest of the data was taken with low dispersion\nspectrographs with resolutions around 15-20 Angstroms,\nand the H\u03b1 /NII lines are blended together, as are the two\nSII lines. We modelled each continuum-subracted spectrum\nas a linear combination of H\u03b1 , NII and SII features, with\nredshift as a free parameter. The model giving the smallest \u03c72 versus the data gave the redshift and its error, also\nthe various linestrengths and a goodness of fit. Spectra with\npoor \u03c72 , large redshift uncertainty or unphysical line ratios were checked by hand and where necessary refitted\nwith different FWHM or initial guesses. Wavelength calibration included cross-correlation of each sky spectrum with\na well calibrated template. The final derived errors average 120 km s\u22121 , as compared with 300 km s\u22121 for the QDOT\nsurvey. Further details are presented in Keeble (1996), and\nOliver et al. (1999).\nBy construction, we have minimised the overlap with\nother redshift surveys, but there are to date 448 galaxies for which we have both our own measurement, and\nhigher resolution measurements by other workers (Figure\n3). There are 31 sources where the velocity difference is\nmore than 3\u03c3 (errors combined in quadrature), if these are\nclipped out, the remaining 417 sources give an average offset\nVP SCz \u2212Vlit = \u22126.1\u00b16.1 km s\u22121 , with a scatter of 124 km s\u22121\nand a reduced \u03c72\u03bd = 0.89 . The scatter includes the contribution from the non-PSCz redshift, and suggests that our\nquoted errors are good estimates of the genuine external error. Of the 31 discrepant redshifts, 5 involve HI observations\nwith unrealistically small quoted errors and with absolute\ndifferences less than 250 km s\u22121 , a further 11 are between\n100 and 600 km s\u22121 and 3 \u2212 5\u03c3, and suggest a non-Gaussian\nerror distribution, and 15 are greater than 700 km s\u22121 and\n5\u03c3 and must represent different galaxies or incorrect line\nidentification or calibration. We thus have 15 redshifts seriously in error out of a total of 896 recent measurements\n(both ours and other workers) giving an error rate of 1.7%.\nWe did not pursue very faint (bJ > 19.5m ) galaxies,\non the basis that (a) they were certain to be at distances\ntoo large to be included for either statistical or dynamical studies, and (b) very large amounts of telescope time\nwould be needed to achieve useful completeness for these\ngalaxies. There are 438 sources without known redshift with\na clear or probable faint optical galaxy identification (with\nbJ > 19.5m ), and a further 127 with no obvious optical identification but no secure identification as a Galactic source\neither. At time of writing we are still lacking redshifts for\n189 brighter (bJ < 19.5m ) galaxies. The sky distribution of\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 3. PSCz versus literature redshifts. Error bars show combined errors.\n\nthese categories is shown in Figure 4. Redshifts are available\nfor 14677 sources.\n3.1\n\nn(z) and selection function\n\nThe n(z) distribution is shown in Figure 5. The source density amounts to 1460 gals ster\u22121 at high latitudes and the\nmedian redshift is 8500 km s\u22121 . To account for the effect of\nthe flux limit on the observed number density of galaxies as\na function of distance, we need to know the selection function \u03c8(r), here defined as the expected number density of\ngalaxies in the survey as a function of distance in the absence\nof clustering. We have derived this both non-parametrically\nand parametrically using the methods of Mann, Saunders\nand Taylor (1996). This method is almost completely insensitive to the assumed cosmology, in the sense that the\nderived expected n(z) is invariant. The resulting selection\nfunction can be transformed to other cosmologies or definitions of distance simply by mapping the volume element or\ndistance, keeping n(z)dz invariant.\nFor simplicity, and to allow comparison with simulations, we assume for derivation purposes a Euclidean\nUniverse without relativistic effects, and with distance r\nequal to V /100h km s\u22121 . We derive the result both nonparametrically, and parametrically using the double powerlaw form\n\u03c8(r) = \u03c8\u2217\n\n\u0010\n\nr\nr\u2217\n\n\u00111\u2212\u03b1 h\n\n1+\n\n\u0010\n\nr\nr\u2217\n\n\u0011\u03b3 i\u2212\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\n\n\u0001\n\n(1)\n\nwhich very well describes the non-parametric results. The\nparameters \u03c8, \u03b1, r\u2217 , \u03b3 and \u03b2 respectively describe the normalisation, the nearby slope, the break distance in h\u22121 Mpc,\nits sharpness and the additional slope beyond it.\nUsing the high-latitude PSCz to derive the selection function, and correcting redshifts only for our motion with\nrespect to the centroid of the local group, V = Vhel +\n300sinlcosb, we obtain\n\u03c8\u2217 = 0.0077, \u03b1 = 1.82, r\u2217 = 86.4, \u03b3 = 1.56, \u03b2 = 4.43\nBoth non-parametric and parametric results are shown\nin Figure 6. The uncertainty in the selection function is\nless than 5% for distances 30 \u2212 200 h\u22121 Mpc, and 10% for\n10 \u2212 300 h\u22121 Mpc, although the selection function drops by\n4 decades over this range.\n\n\f6\n\nW.Saunders et al.\n\nFigure 4.

Later cross-referencing used increasingly sophisticated\nmethods based on Sutherland and Saunders (1992), but\nmany older identifications depend on simple 2\u2032 proximity.\nThe most recent cross-correlation with ZCAT provided 1975\nupdated velocities, of which 84 were altered by more than\n500 km s\u22121 and 50 by more than 1000 km s\u22121 , suggesting an\nerror rate of 2%, in agreement with the analysis of Section\n3.\nThe identifications made for our own redshift followup were\ndone much more carefully than those taken from the literature, using a likelihood approach including full knowledge\nof the error ellipse, optical galaxy source counts etc, and\nchecked by eye from a greyscale image. The number of ambiguous identifications is negligible, though the PSC source\nis often confused between two galaxies separated by a few\narcmin in the cross-scan direction. Where there was real ambiguity, we took redshifts for both galaxies and used the one\nwith larger H\u03b1 flux. It is also possible that Galactic sources\nwere occasionally identified as background galaxies, but we\nbelieve this to be very rare.\n\n4.2\n\nCompleteness\n\nIncompleteness enters into the catalogue for many reasons:\n1) There will be IRAS incompleteness where sources with\ntrue 60\u03bcm flux greater than 0.6 Jy fail to appear in the catalogue. The largest source of this incompleteness is the areas of sky with only 2HCONs, where the PSC incompleteness is estimated as 20% (differential) and 5% (cumulative)\nat 0.6 Jy (ES XII.A.4) . Based on source counts, we estimate that our recovery procedure (Section 2.5) for these\nsources has reduced the overall incompleteness in these areas from 5% to 1.5%; Figure 7 shows the source counts for\nhigh-latitude 2HCON sky. Our recovery procedure was impossible for |b| < 10\u25e6 , so lower-latitude 2HCON sky (2% of\nthe catalogue area) retains the PSC incompleteness.\n2) The PSC is confusion limited in the Plane. However, by\nconstruction, the PSCz does not cover any areas with High\nSource Density at 60\u03bcm (as defined in ES V.H.6), and the\nmask defined at 100\u03bcm effectively limits the number of confusing sources. Also, at low latitudes, there are known problems in the PSC with noise lagging. However, the source\ncounts shown in Figure 8 show low-latitude incompleteness\nto be small down to 0.6 Jy.\n3) Some galaxies are excluded by our colour criteria. Cool,\nnearby galaxies may fail the 100/60\u03bcm condition, but will\nnormally be included separately as extended sources. From\nthe comparison with the 1.2 Jy survey, we estimate that\nabout 50 galaxies from the PSC have been excluded (see\nSection 5).\n4) No attempt was made to systematically obtain redshifts\nfor galaxies with bJ > 19.5m . At high latitudes, the work of\ne.g. Clements et al. (1996) shows that these will in general be\nfurther than z > 0.1. At lower latitudes, incompleteness cuts\nin at lower redshifts. It was originally hoped that the PSCz\nwould be everywhere complete to z = 0.05, but it is clear\nfrom the 3D density distributions that there is significant\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n7\n\n(10% or more ) incompleteness down to z=0.04 towards the\nanti-centre. The reasons for this are discussed in the next\nsubsection.\nPatchy extinction can lead to higher local extinction than\nour values, which are averages over 1 deg2 bins. We have obtained K \u2032 images of most low-latitude sources without obvious galaxy or Galactic identification; many faint galaxies are\nrevealed, but only a handful of nearby ones. Spectroscopy\nof the missing low-latitude galaxies is continuing as part of\nthe Behind The Plane extension to the PSCz survey; for the\ntime being, we estimate that good completeness has been\n2\nachieved for z < 0.1/10(0.2(AB +AB /10)) . The incompleteness\nis strongly concentrated towards the anticentre and at low\nlatitudes; for |b| > 10\u25e6 , the survey is estimated to be useably\ncomplete to z = 0.05 everywhere.\nThe number of galaxies with bJ < 19.5m for which redshifts are still unknown is 192, or 1.2% of the sample. A\nfurther 85 have only marginal redshift determinations and\nsome of these will be incorrect. Both unknown and marginal\nredshifts are well distributed round the sky, but with some\npreference for lower latitudes.\n\n4.3\n\nExtinction maps\n\nOur extinction maps started from the I100 intensity maps of\nRowan-Robinson et al. (1991), binned into lune bins, with\nthe I100 /AV ratio as given by Boulanger and Perault (1988),\nand AB /AV ratio as given by Mathis (1990). Because the\ndust temperature declines with galactic radius, this procedure over-estimates extinctions towards the galactic centre,\nand under-estimates them towards the anti-centre. We attempted to correct for this dependence of dust temperature\non position by devising a simple model for the dust and\nstarlight in our galaxy. We assumed a doubly exponential,\noptically thin distribution of dust and stars, with standard\nIAU scalelengths for the solar radius and stellar distribution\n(r0 = 8.5 kpc, rsc = 3.5 kpc, zsc = 0.35 kpc) and an assumed\nthe dust to have the same radial and half the vertical scalelength. The dust properties were assumed to be uniform, and\nwe assumed a dust temperature of 20K at the solar radius,\nand proportional to the one fifth power of the local stellar\ndensity elsewhere. We then found, for each position on the\ncelestial sphere, the ratio of 100\u03bcm emission to column density of dust, and normalised this ratio by the Boulanger and\nPerault value for the NGP.\nSubsequent to our definition of the PSCz catalogue and\nmask, Schlegel et al. (1998) used the IRAS ISSA and COBE\nDIRBE data to make beautiful high resolution maps of the\ndust emission and extinction in our Galaxy. Comparison of\nour own maps and those of Schlegel et al. show that (a) our\ntemperature corrections across the galaxy are too small, and\n(b) there are several areas where cooler (16K) dust extends\nto |b| \u223c 30\u25e6 .\nOverall, our extinction estimates may be in error by a factor\n1.5-2, in the sense of being too low towards the anticentre\nand too high towards the galactic centre. This has two principal effects. (a) Towards the anticentre, galaxies may fall\nbelow the bJ = 19.5m limit because of extinction. A subsequent program of K \u2032 -imaging has revealed a handful of extra\nnearby galaxies, and a significant number at redshifts 0.05\nand greater. (b) The definition of the optically-selected cat-\n\n\f8\n\nW.Saunders et al.\n\nalogue in Section 2.3 depends on the extinction corrections.\nWe will have selected too many optical galaxies towards the\ncentre and too few towards the anticentre. However, our\nmatching of addscan and PSC fluxes was designed to be robust to exactly this sort of error. To test for any effect, we\nhave compared the simple, number-weighted dipole of the\nsurface distribution of PSCz galaxies, (a) using the normal\ncatalogue and (b) using purely PSC-derived fluxes as described in section 2.3. The dipole changes by 1\u25e6 in direction\nand 2.5% in amplitude when we do this, showing that any\nbias caused by incorrect extinctions is negligible.\n4.4\n\nFlux accuracy and uniformity\n\nThe error quoted for PSC 60\u03bcm fluxes for genuine point\nsources is just 11%(ES VII.D.2). We are more concerned\nwith any non-fractional random error component, since\nthis may lead to Malmquist-type biases. The analysis in\nLawrence et al. (1999), based on the 12/60\u03bcm colours of\nbright stars, finds an absolute error of 0.059 \u00b1 0.007 Jy,\nin addition to a fractional error of 10%. Stars are better\npoint sources than galaxies, so this may underestimate the\nabsolute error for our sample. We have made an independent estimate, by investigating the scatter between our PSC\nand addscan fluxes. Of course PSC and addscan fluxes start\nfrom the same raw data, but the processing and background\nestimation are entirely different, while the actual photon\nnoise is negligible. The absolute component of the scatter is\n0.06 \u2212 0.07 Jy, of which an estimated 20% comes from the\nerror in the addscan flux - confirming that the Lawrence et\nal. value is a reasonable estimate of the PSC absolute error\ncomponent.\nThis error estimate leads to Malmquist biases in the source\ndensities of order 5-6% (differential, at the flux limit) and\n2-3% (cumulative) (Murdoch, Crawford and Jauncey 1973).\n2HCON sky may have biases as large as 10% (differential)\nand 4% (cumulative), so the non-uniformity introduced into\nthe catalogue should be no worse than 5% (differential) and\n2% (cumulative). This is borne out by the source counts in\nFigures 7 and 8, but note that in any noise-limited catalogue\nsuch as the PSC, where the noise varies across the catalogue,\nthere will always be a regime where Malmquist biases are\nmasked by incompleteness.\nLawrence et al. (1999) find evidence for slight non-linearity\nin the PSC flux scale, but this should not affect any analysis except evolutionary studies. The effect on evolution was\nconsidered by Saunders et al. (1997).\nNon-uniformity can also come about as a result of simple\nchanges in the absolute flux scale. A small fractional error in\nthe calibration will on average lead to an error half again as\nlarge in the source density. There are three obvious reasons\nfor flux scale variations:\n1) The absolute calibration of the third 3HCON was revised\nby a few percent after the release of the PSC (and FSS).\nThe effect of this revision on PSC fluxes would be to change\nthose in the 75% of the sky covered by 3HCONS by 1%.\n2) Whenever the satellite entered the South Atlantic\nAnomaly, radiation hits altered the sensitivity of the detectors, and data taken during such times were discarded (ES\nIII.C.4). However, this leaves the possibility of Malmquist\neffects, and also data taken near the boundaries of the\nSAA potentially suffers residual effects. We have investi-\n\nFigure 7. Source counts for all high latitude sky (filled circles),\nhigh latitude 2HCON sky (open circles), and area with potential\nSAA problems (triangles).\n\ngated this by checking the source counts for declinations\n\u221240\u25e6 < \u03b4 < 10\u25e6 , where data taken is most likely to be affected. We see no evidence for any variation (Figure 7) above\nthe few % level in source counts.\n3) Whenever the satellite crossed the Galactic Plane, or\nother very bright sources, the detectors suffered from hysteresis. This effect was investigated by Strauss et al. (1990).\nThey found that the likely error is typically less than 1%\nand always less than 2.2%. This is confirmed by the constancy, to within a few percent, of our galaxy source counts\nfor identified galaxies in the PSCz as a function of I100 .\nOverall, differential source densities across the sky due to\nincompleteness, Malmquist effects and sensitivity variations\nare not believed to be greater than a few percent anywhere\nat high latitudes for z < 0.1. Tadros et al. (1999) found an\nupper limit to the rms amplitude of large scale, high latitude\nspherical harmonic components to the density field of the\nPSCz of 3%. Since this is close to the expected variations\ndue to clustering, the variations due to non-uniformity in\nthe catalogue must be smaller than this. At lower latitudes,\nvariations are estimated to be no greater than 10% for z <\n0.05.\n\n5\n\nCOMPARISON WITH THE 1.2 Jy SURVEY\n\nThe 1.2 Jy survey of 5500 IRAS galaxies (Fisher et al. 1995)\nused looser colour criteria than the PSCz, and as such acts\nas a valuable check on the efficacy of our selection procedure\nfrom the PSC. We find that the 1.2 Jy survey contains 11\ngalaxies that have been excluded by our selection criteria. It\ncontains a further 5 galaxies that satisfy the PSCz criteria,\nbut are not included due to programming and editing errors,\neither during construction of the QIGC survey or its various\nextensions and supplements to form the PSCz. Extrapolating these numbers to lower fluxes, we can expect that about\n50 PSC galaxies are missing altogether from the catalogue.\nConversely, the conservative selection criteria for the 1.2 Jy\nsurvey led to much greater levels of contamination by cirrus\nand other Galactic sources than in the PSCz. In the 1.2 Jy\nsurvey, these were eliminated by visual inspection of sky survey plates; inevitably real galaxies occasionally got thrown\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe PSCz catalogue\n\n9\n\nFairall, Karl Fisher, Michael Strauss, Marc Davis, Raj Visvanathan, Luis DaCosta, Riccardo Giovanelli, Nanyao Lu,\nCarmen Pantoja, Tadafumi Takata, Kouichiro Nakanishi,\nToru Yamada, Tim Conrow, Delphine Hardin, Mick Bridgeland, Renee Kraan-Kortweg, Amos Yahil, Ron Beck, Esperanza Carrasco, Pierre Chamaraux, Lucie Bottinelli, Gary\nWegner, Roger Clowes and Brent Tully, for the provision of\nredshifts prior to publication or other software or data.

(1999).\n\n6\n\nANCILLARY INFORMATION\n\nAlong with the PSC data, the catalogue also contains the following information: POSS/SRC plate and position on that\nplate; the RA,\u03b4, offset, diameters and magnitude of the best\nmatch from the digitised sky survey plates; name, magnitude\nand diameters from UGC/ESO/MCG, PGC name, de Vaucouleurs type and HI widths where available; most accurate\navailable redshift and our own redshift measurement; classification as galaxy/cirrus/etc; estimated I100 and extinction;\naddscan flux and width when treated as an extended source,\nand point source filtered addscan flux.\n\n7\n\nACCESSING THE CATALOGUE\n\nThe data is available from the CDS catalogue service\n(http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Cats.html). Full and short versions of the catalogue, maskfiles, description files, format\nstatements and notes, are also available via the PSCz web\nsite\n(http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/\u223cwjs/pscz.html), or by\nanonymous\nftp\nfrom\nftp://ftp-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/pub/users/wjs/pscz/ .\n\n8\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe PSC-z survey has only been possible because of the generous assistance from many people in the astronomical community.
