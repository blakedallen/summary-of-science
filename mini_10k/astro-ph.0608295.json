As probes\nof galaxy formation, dwarf galaxies should be extremely sensitive to processes such as star\nformation feedback, ram pressure stripping, and tidal stripping. These processes are often\ninvoked to explain properties of relatively luminous galaxies and should even more dramatically affect dwarf galaxies, which have smaller masses and shallower potential wells. As\nprobes of cosmology, the number of dwarf galaxies has provided a challenge for cosmological\nmodels.\nThe current Cold Dark Matter model with a cosmological constant (\u039bCDM; Spergel\net al. 2006) makes robust predictions for the number of dark matter halos as a function\nof mass (Sheth et al. 2001). However, extending this model to predict the number density\nof observed galaxies requires including physical effects such as gas cooling, star-formation,\nsupernova feedback, etc., that are too complex to follow exactly in numerical predictions. It\nis clear that the number of galaxies as a function of luminosity is much shallower than the\nprediction for the number as a function of halo mass (Benson et al. 2003). The most extreme\nexample of this problem is the \"substructure problem\" in the Local Group (Klypin et al.\n1999; Moore et al. 1999). If we assume galaxies are associated one-to-one with dark matter\nhalos and that \u039bCDM is correct, the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies therefore must decline\nas a function of host halo mass. That is, the efficiency of forming stars and/or retaining gas\nmust be much smaller for low mass galaxies.\nA number of physical models have been proposed to explain high mass-to-light ratios\nin low mass galaxies, including photoevaporation of gas during reionization (Shapiro et al.\n2004; Mayer & Moore 2004), suppression of gas accretion during reionization (Gnedin 2000;\nBullock et al. 2000; Benson et al. 2003), feedback from supernovae (Dekel & Woo 2003;\nNagashima & Yoshii 2004), and ram pressure stripping of gas (Mori & Burkert 2000). Some\nof these processes only occur for dwarf galaxies near a luminous galaxy and not for isolated\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nones (Kravtsov et al. 2004). The relative importance of these processes in the evolution\nof dwarf galaxies has significant implications for galaxies of all sizes at both low and high\nredshift. For example, the importance of galactic winds in low mass galaxies will strongly\naffect our understanding of the mass-metallicity relation (Tremonti et al. 2004; Lee et al.\n2006) and the enrichment of the intergalactic medium at high redshift (Scannapieco et al.\n2005). By comparing the gas content and Tully-Fisher relationships of dwarfs as a function of\nenvironment, it should be possible to determine the importance of \"external\" environmental\neffects like stripping relative to \"internal\" effects such as feedback.\nHistorically, extremely low luminosity nearby galaxies have been difficult to find because\ntheir colors and apparent sizes are similar to those of more luminous, and far more numerous,\nbackground galaxies. By far the best known set of dwarfs is that in the Local Group (Mateo\n1998; Grebel et al. 2003; Dolphin et al. 2005), where the even the lowest mass dwarfs can\nbe detected as over-densities in stellar counts (Willman et al. 2005; Zucker et al. 2004). The\ndwarf galaxy population has also been well studied in nearby clusters, such as Virgo and\nFornax, where the number of dwarfs is large relative the background population (Binggeli\net al. 1985; Ferguson & Sandage 1991) or in other environments where dwarfs are expected,\neg. as satellites to bright galaxies (Zaritsky et al. 1997; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2002). Assembling\nsamples of dwarfs in more distant and less dense environments has been challenging. Using\ncriteria such as surface brightness and irregularity, several authors have assembled large\ncatalogs of nearby dwarf galaxies (Impey et al. 1996; Schombert et al. 2001; Hunter &\nElmegreen 2004; Karachentsev et al. 2004).\nAddressing the above issues requires a large sample of galaxies across a range of environments, with minimal selection effects. Deep, wide-field optical spectroscopic surveys,\nsuch as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), provide a large, homogeneous sample of dwarf\ngalaxies covering a wide range of galactic properties and environments. Concurrently, blind\nHI surveys such as the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS; Meyer et al. 2004) and the upcoming Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA; Giovanelli et al. 2005) will provide\nsimilarly large samples, with a very complementary set of selection effects.\nUnlike present-day massive disk galaxies, which have used up much of their gas reservoirs (Read & Trentham 2005), the gaseous component of dwarf galaxies cannot be ignored\n(Schombert et al. 2001; van Zee 2001). Indeed, we show that at the lowest luminosities\ndwarf galaxies are mostly neutral gas. A galaxy's gas content reflects the efficiency of star\nformation modified by processes which add or removal gas from the system such as gas infall or ram pressure stripping. The goal of this paper is to combine the optical properties,\ndynamics and neutral gas content of low mass dwarf galaxies in order to better understand\nthe processes important in dwarf galaxy evolution.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nWe present neutral hydrogen (HI) observations for 101 low luminosity dwarf galaxies\nselected with uniform and well-understood criteria from the SDSS. We describe the catalog\nfrom which these dwarfs were selected in \u00a7 2.1, estimate the environment of each object in\n\u00a7 2.2 and discuss the HI observations in \u00a7 2.3. We investigate correlations between the gas\nfraction, color, star formation rate and environment of this sample in \u00a7 3.1 and the TullyFisher relationship in \u00a7 3.2. When necessary, we assume a Hubble constant of H0 = 70h70 Mpc\nkm s\u22121 where h70 = 1.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData\n\nThe Sample\n\nWe selected dwarf galaxies with magnitude Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 > \u221216 for HI observations\nfrom the low luminosity galaxy catalog of Blanton et al. (2005), a subsample of the New\nYork University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC; Blanton et al. 2005b) based on\nthe SDSS (York et al. 2000) Data Release 2 (DR2; Abazajian et al. 2004). The Blanton\net al. (2005) catalog represents a significant improvement over simply selecting galaxies from\nthe SDSS catalog, which is not optimized for nearby, low surface brightness galaxies. It\nis a flux-limited sample selected with an optical apparent magnitude limit of mr \u223c 17.8.\nFor each galaxy, the catalog provides the SDSS redshift, multi-band photometry, structural\nmeasurements (in particular, two-dimensional S\u00e9rsic fits as described in Blanton et al.) and\nemission line measurements (Tremonti et al. 2004). Distances are estimated based on a\nmodel of the local velocity field (Willick et al. 1997). Distance errors have been folded into\nerror estimations of all distance-dependent quantities such as absolute magnitude and HI\nmass.\nThere are two selection effects of the Blanton et al. (2005) catalog relevant to this\nanalysis: (1) The SDSS flux limit at mr \u223c 17.8 restricts the detection of galaxies with\nMr \u2212 5 log10 h70 = \u221216 to within 60 Mpc in distance (20 Mpc for the least luminous galaxies,\nMr \u2212 5 log10 h70 = \u221213.5). The catalog therefore does not span the full range of galaxy\nenvironments. While there are plenty of voids and groups in this volume, there are few\nvery dense regions. For example, given the angular limits of the SDSS DR2, we see only the\nfringes of the Virgo Cluster. (2) The catalog does not include low surface brightness galaxies.\nAs shown in Blanton et al. (2005), the SDSS completeness as a function of half-light surface\nbrightness drops below 50% at \u03bc50,r \u223c 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 . In the absolute magnitude range of\ninterest, we would miss half of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (Mateo 1998) given this\nsurface brightness cutoff. According to the definition of McGaugh (1996), 10% of our sample\ngalaxies are considered Low Surface Brightness (LSB) with \u03bcB\no \u2265 22.7. With the exception of\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthese two selection effects, the Blanton et al. spectroscopic catalog is not selected by galaxy\nproperty in any particular way. For example, galaxies have not been selected for or against\nirregular looking morphologies.\nWe present here HI observations for 101 dwarf galaxies in the absolute magnitude range\n\u221213.5 > Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 > \u221216 selected from the Blanton et al. (2005) catalog. These data\nare part of a larger, on-going survey to obtain HI line-widths and H\u03b1 rotation curves for a\nsignificant fraction of galaxies in this catalog with Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 > \u221216. The complete\ncatalog contains 1034 galaxies at these luminosities. The 101 galaxies presented here are\nrepresentative of the full catalog.\n\n2.2.\n\nEnvironment and the Nearest Neighbor Distances\n\nA goal of this paper is to understand the effects of environment on the properties of\ndwarf galaxies. To quantify the environment, we calculate for each dwarf galaxy the projected\ndistance to its nearest luminous neighbor. We cannot rely on the SDSS alone to determine\nthis distance for several reasons. First, the angular distances between nearest neighbor\ngalaxies can be large for this nearby sample- for example, searching a 1 Mpc region around\na galaxy 30 Mpc away corresponds to 2 degrees on the sky. Many of our dwarf galaxies are on\nthe SDSS Southern stripes, which are only 2.5 degrees wide. In addition, because the SDSS\nreduction software is not optimized for large extended objects, and fails to process them\ncorrectly, the SDSS catalog does not contain many of the bright galaxies within 30 Mpc.\nThus, to calculate the environments of our dwarf galaxy sample, we need a supplemental\ncatalog that extends beyond the SDSS area and contains the brightest galaxies.\nBoth of these considerations drive us to use the The Third Reference Catalog of Galaxies\n(RC3; de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), which is a nearly complete catalog of nearby luminous\ngalaxies. To determine environments for our dwarf galaxies, we determine the distance to\nits nearest \"luminous\" neighbor. We define \"luminous\" galaxies as brighter than Mr \u2212\n5 log10 h70 < \u221219 or have circular velocities greater than Vc > 100 km s\u22121 (Haynes et al.\n1999). While we would like to include galaxies of all sizes in our environment estimate,\nthe availability of a complete comparison catalog restricts our search to luminous neighbors.\nFrom the B and V photometry listed in RC3, we infer Mr for each RC3 galaxy using the\nkcorrect product (see \u00a7 3.1) . For galaxies which have the relevant entries listed, we call\ngalaxies luminous if Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 < \u221219. While this absolute magnitude is set by the\ncatalog limits, it roughly corresponds to the dividing line between normal and dwarf galaxies.\nFor RC3 galaxies which do not have the relevant entries, but do have HI data listed, we call\nthem luminous if W20 > 200 km s\u22121 (W20 is twice the maximum circular velocity of the HI\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ngas, see \u00a7 2.3). Finally, there are some galaxies with neither HI data nor optical photometry\nlisted in RC3. For this small set, we extract the \"magnitude\" from the NASA Extragalactic\nDatabase (NED), which empirically is very similar to the B band RC3 magnitude, and\nguess Mr based on that magnitude. Additionally, we update the coordinates in RC3 using\nthe NED coordinates for each of the catalog objects. This set of bright galaxies is not\nperfectly uniform, but is suitable for our purposes.\nTo determine the nearest neighbor distance, we ask whether there is a luminous RC3\n\u22121\nneighbor within a projected distance of 2.5 h\u22121\nin redshift for each dwarf\n70 Mpc and 300 km s\ngalaxy in our sample. We choose these limits because Blanton et al. (2006) have shown that\nenvironmental affects are strongest inside this scale. About 20% of our galaxies have no\nsuch neighbor; for these objects, we set the nearest neighbor distance to 2.5 Mpc. Using\nthe SDSS Catalog Archive Server\u2217 , we have looked at wide field mosaic images around all\nof our objects and checked by eye that the RC3 catalog object is indeed the nearest bright\nneighbor. This check is not perfect due to the edge effects of SDSS, but provides a sanity\ncheck on our procedure.\n\n2.3.\n\nHI Observations\n\nWe obtained HI radio observations with the Arecibo 305-m telescope and the Green\nBank 100-m Telescope (GBT) in July \u2013 August 2005 and March \u2013 April 2006. At Arecibo,\nwe used the L-wide receiver in 9-level sampling mode with 1024 channels and a 12.5 MHz\nbandwidth. At GBT, we used the L-band with 8192 channels and a bandwidth of 12.5 MHz.\nThe Arecibo configuration yields a velocity resolution of 2.5 km s\u22121 , the GBT configuration\nyields a resolution of 0.3 km s\u22121 . Standard ON/OFF position switching was used during\nboth the Arecibo and GBT observations. The total on-source integration times were on\naverage 10 minutes for the Arecibo data and 20 minutes for the GBT data. The average\nhalf-light radius of the dwarf galaxies in our sample is \u223c 8\u2032\u2032 and they should be completely\ncontained within the radio beamsize of 3\u2032 and 9\u2032 for Arecibo and GBT, respectively. We\nhave searched the beam coverage for nearby contaminating galaxies and have removed the\nfew cases in which a nearby galaxy is contained in the beam and is within 100 km s\u22121 of the\ntargeted galaxy. Optical images and HI profiles for three representative galaxies are shown\nin Figure 1. Our observations yielded strong HI detections for 88 of 101 galaxies. The 13\ngalaxies which did not yield HI detections are represented by upper limits in the analysis of\n\u00a7 3.1 and are excluded from the Tully-Fisher analysis in \u00a7 3.2, since we cannot estimate HI\n\u2217\n\nhttp://cas.sdss.org\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nline-widths for these galaxies.\nWe compute the 20% HI line-width (W20) by finding the peak HI flux within 150 km s\u22121\nof the optical radial velocity of each galaxy and computing the difference between the nearest\npoints having 20% of the peak flux. The integrated HI flux is calculated by expanding the\nW20 values by 20 km s\u22121 on a side and integrating the flux in this region. Errors bars on\nthe line widths and integrated fluxes were computed using a Monte Carlo bootstrap method:\nnoise was added to the stacked one-dimensional radio spectra based on the observed variance\nin the baseline and the observed quantities measured. Error bars on the line-width and\nintegrated flux were calculated from the scatter in the mean quantities recovered form the\nMonte Carlo simulations. We convert the HI integrated flux into HI mass based on the\noptically-thin approximation: MHI = 2.356 \u00d7 105 D 2 FHI where D is the distance in Mpc and\nFHI is the integrated HI flux in Jy km s\u22121 (Eqn. 9; Haynes & Giovanelli 1984). We note that\nthis standard HI mass conversion is a lower limit to the true HI mass if the galaxy contains\noptically thick HI. Error bars on the HI mass include the HI flux error and the error in the\ndistance.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nThe 101 dwarf galaxies presented in this paper represent the largest homogeneous sample\nof galaxies fainter than Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 > \u221216 with well-measured HI and optical properties.\nProperties of the sample are listed in Table 1; the distribution of these properties is shown in\nFigure 2. The average absolute magnitude, corrected for Galactic extinction (Schlegel et al.\n1998), of our sample is hMr i = \u221215.4 at an average distance of 30 h\u22121\n70 Mpc. Galaxies in the\nsample tend to be blue, hg \u2212 ri = 0.3, reflecting the fact that our sample does not probe\nthe densest environments where red dwarf ellipticals tend to reside. The galaxies have an\naverage effective surface brightness of h\u03bcr,eff i = 22.4 mag arcsec\u22122 , and exponential surface\nbrightness profiles as measured by the S\u00e9rsic index (hnSersic i = 1.1). The average effective\nhalf-light r-band radius is hreff,r i = 8\u2032\u2032 = 1.0 h\u22121\n70 kpc. These galaxies exist in environments\nranging from dense groups to truly isolated objects: about 15% of the sample are satellites\nof luminous host galaxies, defined as being within 200 h\u22121\n70 kpc projected distance and 300\n\u22121\nkm s in velocity of a galaxies with Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 < \u221219 (see \u00a7 2.2). Meanwhile, about\n65% of the galaxies are further than 500 h\u22121\n70 kpc of any such host galaxy - they are very\nisolated galaxies.\nThe dwarf galaxies in our sample were not selected with respect to morphology or gas\ncontent. The sample consists of \u223c 10% gas-poor dwarf galaxies commonly known as \"dwarf\nspheroidal\" or \"dwarf elliptical\" galaxies. The majority of our sample consists of gas-rich\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndwarfs commonly known as \"dwarf irregular\" galaxies. This latter term is commonly misinterpreted to mean that gas-rich dwarf galaxies have disorganized morphology or turbulent\nkinematics. Historically, the term \"irregular\" indicates that the HII regions in a galaxy do\nnot follow a regular spiral arm pattern as observed in normal massive disk galaxies (Sandage\n1975; Skillman 1996). Indeed, our sample dwarf galaxies do not show any evidence of spiral\nstructure, based on the visual inspection of unsharp-masked SDSS r-band images. However,\nour dwarfs do have well-defined optical centers and regular morphology (Figure 1) as has\nbeen noted by previous studies of dwarf galaxies in this regime (Matthews & Gallagher 2002).\nOur HI radio profile shapes suggest that our dwarf galaxies have regular rotation fields: 18%\nof the HI profiles have distinct double-peaked shapes implying a coherent rotation field; this\nfraction increases to 30% if we limit the sample to edge-on galaxies (b/a < 0.4) only. Thus\nwhile the classification \"dwarf irregular\" is correct for the majority of our sample galaxies,\ndue to its common misinterpretation, we simply refer to all the galaxies in this sample simply\nas low luminosity dwarf galaxies.\n\n3.1.\n\nHI Gas Fractions\n\nWe first investigate the ratio of gas mass to total baryonic mass in our dwarf galaxy\nsample. We define the gas fraction as fgas = Mgas /(Mgas + Mstellar ). The denominator of\nthis expression is the total baryonic mass defined as the sum of the gas and stellar mass.\nWe take Mgas = 1.4MHI , where MHI is calculated in \u00a7 2.3 and the multiplicative factor\ntakes in account the presence of helium and metals. We do not include a correction term\nfor molecular hydrogen (H2 ) as the H2 /HI ratio is much lower in dwarf galaxies compared\nto luminous spirals (Leroy et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 1998). This deficiency holds even after\naccounting for a strong metallicity dependence of the H2 tracer molecule CO (Garnett 2002).\nThe stellar mass, Mstellar , is based on the optical SDSS i-band magnitude and (g \u2212 r) colors\nusing the mass-to-light ratios determined from the galaxy evolution models of Bell et al.\n(2003) using the Kroupa et al. (1993) initial mass function (that is, we subtract 0.15 dex\nfrom Bell et al. Table 7 calculated for a 'diet' Salpeter initial mass function). We choose this\ncombination of magnitude and color to minimize contamination from emission lines and thus\nprobe the \"true\" stellar continuum (West 2005). We have calculated the stellar mass based\non the broad-band fluxes using the kcorrect product\u2020 and based on the spectra published by\nKauffmann et al. (2003). Both these methods produce somewhat lower stellar mass (\u223c 30%)\nthan predicted by Bell et al. We stress that the mass-to-light ratios are very sensitive to\nthe assumed initial mass function. We note that the gas fraction does not depend on the\n\u2020\n\nhttp://cosmo.nyu.edu/blanton/kcorrect; Blanton et al. (2003)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndistance to individual galaxies.\nThe average gas fraction for our sample is hfgas i = 0.6, with gas fractions as high as 95%.\nThus, for the majority of the dwarf galaxies in our sample, the baryonic mass is dominated\nby gas, rather than stars. In Figure 3 we plot gas fraction as a function of absolute r-band\nmagnitude. The flux limits of our sample are clearly seen in this figure. We compare our\nresults to representative samples from the literature by converting the literature magnitudes\nto r-band using the photometric transformations from kcorrect (see the web page referenced\nabove) and recalculate gas fractions using the same methods described above. The most\ncomparable sample of galaxies is that of LSB dwarf galaxies by Schombert, McGaugh, &\nEder (2001). The gas fractions in this sample are comparable to our SDSS (higher surface\nbrightness) sample. For more luminous spiral galaxies, the average gas fraction is much lower:\nBell & de Jong (2000) find an average gas fraction of 30% for a sample of low-inclination\nspiral galaxies. The average gas fraction for the large field spiral sample of Haynes et al.\n(1999) is 25%, assuming an average color V \u2212 I = 1.0. A clear trend is seen in Figure 3:\nless luminous galaxies tend toward higher gas fractions. While galaxies exist in the lower\nleft region of the plot (faint, gas-poor dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies), they\nare rare in the upper right region (based on the HIPASS sample, West et al. in prep). In\nother words, galaxies fainter than Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 \u223c \u221216 span the full range of possible\ngas fractions, while there is an upper limit to the gas fractions of brighter galaxies which\ndepends on absolute magnitude. This trend has been noted by several authors (McGaugh &\nde Blok 1997; Schombert et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2002); Figure 3 extends this to significantly\nfainter absolute magnitudes compared to previous studies.\nWe interpret the gas fractions in Figure 3 as evidence that, compared to more luminous\ngalaxies, dwarf galaxies are far less efficient at turning gas into stars over their lifetimes.\nThis is likely related to lower on average gas surface densities in lower luminosity systems.\nKennicutt (1998), Martin & Kennicutt (2001) and references therein have shown for luminous\ngalaxies that star formation does not occur below a critical gas density (\u223c 5 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ). Hunter\net al. (1998) confirm that this limit holds for low mass systems, although the critical density is\nslightly lower (\u223c 3 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ), due in part to the lack of spiral arms and solid-body kinematics\nin the inner regions of dwarfs. We cannot precisely measure the average gas density in this\nsample because our HI single-dish observations do not provide an estimate of the HI radius.\nHowever, we can estimate the HI radius by assuming it scales (roughly) with the optical\nradius. We adopt an average HI-to-optical radius scaling calculated by Begum et al. (2006)\nof rHI /rH\u03b1 = 2.5. The average gas density of our sample is 1.5 M\u2299 pc\u22122 with more than\na factor of two scatter. Thus, the majority of galaxies in this sample are at, or below,\nthe critical gas density required for star formation. If the threshold described in Kennicutt\n(1998) exists, the star formation in these dwarf galaxies implies that the local density of gas\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nin the regions of star formation significantly exceeds the global density averaged over the\nwhole galaxy.\nIn the top right panel of Figure 4, we show that the gas fraction is a strong function of\ng \u2212 r color in the sense that bluer galaxies in our sample are gas-rich. We assume that the\nspread in g \u2212 r color represents a spread in time-averaged star formation over the past 1 Gyr,\nas opposed to a spread in metallicity, for two reasons. First, the bluest colors in our sample\ncannot be explained by old, metal poor stellar population synthesis models. Second, the\nmajority of galaxies in our sample are currently forming stars (as indicated by H\u03b1 emission\nin the SDSS spectra) which dominates their broad-band colors (Bruzual & Charlot 2003).\nThus, in the top left of Figure 4, the gas-rich galaxies have had a higher fraction of their\nstar-formation in the recent past. In contrast, the current star formation rate per unit area\n(within the last few million years) is not correlated with gas fraction (Figure 4, bottom left).\nWe calculate this current star formation rate based on the u-band flux using the conversion\nfrom Hopkins et al. (2003). For comparison, we also calculated the star formation rates\nbased on the H\u03b1 emission line flux in the SDSS spectra (detected for most of our galaxies),\nbut found that the resulting rates suffered from the uncertainty of extrapolating the H\u03b1\nflux from the 3\u2032\u2032 SDSS fiber aperture. We normalize the total star formation rate by the\narea over which star formation is occurring in order to remove any size-dependent variations\nwithin our sample. The median total star formation rate per unit area based on the u-band\nfor our sample is SF R = 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 ; These rates are comparable to previous\nstudies of gas-rich galaxies in this luminosity range (Hunter & Elmegreen 2004; van Zee 2001;\nBarazza et al. 2006). The star formation rates per unit area are shown in the bottom left of\nFigure 4 and are not correlated with gas fraction. The gas fraction is better correlated with\nthe time-averaged star-formation rate over the last billion years (g \u2212 r color) than with the\nrecent star-formation rate in the last few million years. This implies that the star formation\nrates we are observing now are different than those in the recent past; the star formation\nrates appear to be stochastic.\nWe attempt to quantify the stochastic nature of star formation in our sample by calculating the stellar birthrate timescale. In the left panel of Figure 5, we plot the observed stellar\nmass divided by the current star formation rate (Mstellar /SF Rtot ). If the current rate of star\nformation has been constant over the lifetime of a galaxy, this quantity would represent the\ntime needed to form its observed stellar component. For our sample, the median timescale to\nmake stars is 15 Gyrs with a nearly symmetric scatter to both shorter and longer timescales.\nObservations of the color-magnitude diagrams of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group suggest\nthat all dwarfs have an ancient stellar population component (Mateo 1998; Dolphin et al.\n2005). If we assume all the galaxies in our sample formed at early times (10-12 Gyr), this\nimplies that roughly half the sample had lower star formation rates and half had higher rates\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nin the past than presently observed. This line of argument again suggests that star formation\nin dwarfs fluctuates and that the current star formation rate is not necessarily representative\nof the time-averaged rate. In the right panel of Figure 5 we also investigate the future of\nstar formation by plotting the gas consumption timescale (Mgas /SF Rtot ). In this plot we\nhave not included gas-recycling, which would increase the gas consumption timescales. The\nmajority of galaxies in this sample will be able to make stars, and therefore consume gas, at\ntheir present rates for another Hubble time.\nThe strongest observed trend in our sample is that between the gas fraction and g \u2212 r\ncolor (Figure 4, top left panel). This trend may be due to either internal or external processes.\nFor example, a galaxy may use up its gas by forming stars and thus have redder colors due\nto a lower star formation rate compared to the recent past. Alternatively, a galaxy's gas\ncould be removed in denser environments and appear redder due to quenching of its star\nformation. Since we have quantified the environment of each galaxy (see \u00a7 2.2), we are able\nto test whether this and other trends are due internal or external processes.\nThe top right panel of Figure 4 suggests that both internal and external processes are\nimportant in controlling the trend between gas fraction and color. For gas-rich galaxies in our\nsample, with fgas > 0.4, the gas fractions are uncorrelated with nearest neighbor distance. In\ncontrast, galaxies with low gas fractions (fgas < 0.4) are preferentially found within 0.5 Mpc\nof a luminous neighbor galaxy. Thus, it appears that some reduction in the gas fraction is\nrelated to internal processes such as normal star-formation, \"primordial\" removal of gas at\nreionization, or outflows, however, only environmental effects are very effective at removing\nall of the gas from a dwarf galaxy. This is further supported by the bottom right panel\nof Figure 4. While red galaxies only exist near luminous neighbors, the colors of the blue\nsequence galaxies do not depend on distance to the nearest neighbor. This result is similar\nto the relationship between color and environment, or morphology and environment, seen\nin more luminous galaxies (e.g. in Hubble 1936; Oemler 1974; Norberg et al. 2002; Blanton\net al. 2005a), and the dwarf galaxy population of the Local Group (Grebel et al. 2003). We\nconclude that while internal processes are able to reduce the gas fractions to fgas \u223c 0.4,\nexternal processes are require to lower the gas fractions (via removal of gas as suggested\nbelow via residuals in the Tully-Fisher relation) further.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relationship\n\nThe Tully-Fisher relationship relates the mass of a galaxy as inferred from its luminous\ncomponent to its dynamical mass, as measured by the maximum rotational velocity. The\ntight coupling between these components has greatly informed our understanding of galaxy\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nformation (Mo et al. 1998; van den Bosch 2000; Bullock et al. 2001; Mayer & Moore 2004).\nDwarf galaxies with rotation velocities less than 90 km s\u22121 tend to fall below the optical\nTully-Fisher relationship established by massive galaxies in the sense that the ratio of stellar\nto dynamical mass is lower for the dwarfs (McGaugh et al. 2000; Matthews et al. 1998). This\n\"break\" has sometimes been interpreted as evidence that dwarf galaxies have preferentially\nlost baryonic mass due to e.g. supernovae winds (Dekel & Silk 1986; Dekel & Woo 2003).\nMcGaugh et al. (2000) first noted that this break is removed when both the stellar and\ngaseous components are taken into account. This baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship has been\ninvestigated by many groups (Bell & de Jong 2001; Verheijen 2001; Gurovich et al. 2004;\nMcGaugh 2005). Understanding the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for low mass galaxies\nshould place tight constraints on the role of ram pressure stripping, tidal stripping, feedback,\ngalactic winds, photoevaporation during reionization in the evolution of dwarf galaxies.\nIn Figures 6 and 7, we explore the Tully-Fisher relationship within our dwarf galaxy sample. We estimate the maximum rotational velocities for our galaxies based on the inclinationand turbulence-corrected HI profile half-width (W20i,t /2). While we will present resolved\noptical H\u03b1 rotation curves for this sample in a forthcoming paper, the HI line-widths are a\nmore reliable measure of the maximum rotation velocity in these low mass systems. This\nis because the optical rotation curves of low mass galaxies rarely show a velocity turnover\nat the last optically measured data point (Matthews & Gallagher 2002), leading to an underestimate of the true maximum rotation velocity. Resolved HI rotation curves also do not\nalways show a velocity turnover (McGaugh et al. 2001), however the HI tends to extend\n2-3 times beyond the observed optical radii (Begum et al. 2006) and thus is a more reliable\nprobe of the true maximum rotation velocity.\nThe dwarf galaxies in our sample have a significant rotation component (Figure 1). We\ncorrect the observed HI line-widths for line broadening due to turbulent velocity dispersion\nand inclination using the formula first proposed by Bottinelli et al. (1983):\nW20 \u2212 W20t\n(1)\nsin i\nWhere W20 is the observed HI line-width, W20t is the turbulent velocity correction term\nand i is the inclination angle inferred from the optical images. We confirm the validity of a\nlinear turbulence correction based on modeling the integrated velocity profiles of simulated\ngalaxies constructed from Hernquist (1993) model disk galaxies. For nearby dwarf galaxies\nwith rotation velocities similar to our sample, Begum et al. (2006) have measured velocity\ndispersion in the gas component of \u03c3los = 8 km s\u22121 based on the average line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion measured from 2D velocity maps. Using the Begum et al. value, this results in\na turbulence correction of W20t = 16 km s\u22121 , which we use here. Altering this turbulence\ncorrection (say to 25 km s\u22121 ) does not change our results below.\nW20i,t =\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nUsing the approach of Haynes & Giovanelli (1984), we infer sin i from the b/a axis ratio\nbased on two-dimensional S\u00e9rsic fitting of the r-band SDSS images. In particular, we assume\nthe disks to be intrinsically oblate and axisymmetric, with a three-dimensional axis ratio of\nq0 , and take:\ns\n1 \u2212 (b/a)2\n,\n(2)\nsin i =\n1 \u2212 q02\nwith q0 = 0.19. Again, changing the particular value of q0 (say to 0.3) again does not change\nour results significantly.\nFigure 6 shows the stellar, HI and baryonic Tully-Fisher relationships for our dwarf\ngalaxy sample. In the three panels of this figure, we linearly regress to fit a function of the\nform:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nW20i,t /2\nmass\nlog10\n(3)\n= a + b log10\n108 h\u22122\n50kms\u22121\n70 M\u2299\nwhere a and b are the fitted intercept and slope of the Tully-Fisher relationship, respectively.\nThese fits are regressions with mass as the independent variable. Table 2 lists their values\nand uncertainties (calculated from bootstrap resampling). In addition, we calculate the\ncorrelation coefficient r between each pair of variables, listed in each panel of Figure 6. The\ncorrelation coefficient is zero for two unrelated quantities and unity for two perfectly linearly\nrelated quantities (e.g. Lupton 1993).\nThe stellar Tully-Fisher (Figure 6, right panel) has significantly more scatter than the\neither the HI or total baryonic relationships (Figure 6, middle and left panels). The stellar\nrelation has a much lower correlation coefficient (r \u223c 0.3 versus r \u223c 0.8) and considerably\nmore scatter about the best fit regression line, as listed in Table 2 (about 50% scatter\ncompared to about 30% scatter), than do the HI mass or baryonic mass TF relationships.\nThis result is perhaps not surprising: at low luminosities, stars contribute far less to the\ntotal baryonic mass compared to massive galaxies (Figure 3). Thus, for dwarf galaxies of\nthe same total mass, the amount of gas turned into stars varies between systems. While\nthe scatter in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship is much smaller compared to the stellar\nrelationship, it does have more scatter than accounted for by our observational error bars.\nThe fitted slope is unchanged if we restrict our sample to only galaxies whose inclination\ncorrections are small (b/a < 0.4) or if we alter our assumptions about turbulence or the\nintrinsic axis-ratio.\nIn Figure 7, we compare our dwarf galaxy sample to Tully-Fisher data available in the\nliterature. We compare only to literature samples for which HI and optical measurements\nare available: Haynes et al. (1999), Verheijen (2001), Matthews et al. (1998), and McGaugh\net al. (2000). For the literature datasets, we recalculate distances based on H0 = 70 Mpc\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nkm s\u22121 and a model of the local velocity field (Willick et al. 1997) (for galaxies with recession\nvelocities less than 6000 km s\u22121 ). For the Haynes et al. (1999) data, we assume a constant\ncolor of V \u2212 I = 1.0.\nIn the left panel of Figure 7 we plot the optical Tully-Fisher relationship in the I-band.\nMcGaugh et al. (2000) first noted that low mass dwarf galaxies fall well below the optical\nTully-Fisher (TF) relationship as defined by luminous spiral galaxies in the sense that, for\na given rotation velocity, the dwarfs are optically under-luminous compared to the expected\nTF value. McGaugh et al. also noted that these same galaxies lie on the same relation\ndefined by luminous galaxies in the baryonic TF relationship (Figure 7, right panel). Again,\nthis is not surprising: we have shown above that dwarf galaxies have high gas fractions and\nthe optical luminosity/stellar mass is often only a few percent of the total baryonic mass.\nHowever, unlike McGaugh et al., we do not see evidence for a distinct break in slope of the\noptical TF occurring at 90 km s\u22121 . At low luminosities, the scatter around the optical TF\nrelation does increase considerably, but not preferentially to high or low velocities.\nThat a single linear fit adequately describes the baryonic TF data over more than three\ndecades of mass is significant. Many authors have suggested that supernovae-driven winds\nwill preferentially remove baryonic material from galaxies with vmax < 100 km s\u22121 due to\ntheir far smaller gravitational potentials compared to luminous galaxies (Dekel & Silk 1986;\nDekel & Woo 2003). Figure 7 suggests that a critical mass threshold does not exist below\nwhich mass-ejection is efficient down to baryonic masses of 108 M\u2299 and rotational velocities\nof as low as 20 km s\u22121 . If a critical threshold existed, we would have expected to see a break\nin the baryonic Tully-Fisher.\nWhile it might be possible to explain this single relationship via a baryonic mass-loss\nrate which varies smoothly with mass, the measured slope of this relation suggests that this\nis not the case. From the virial theorem, the expected slope of the baryonic TF is b = 0.33.\nThe predicted slope from cosmological simulations is b \u223c 0.29, or as more commonly quoted\n1/b \u223c 3.5 (Bullock et al. 2001; Kravtsov et al. 2004), in good agreement with our value of\nb = 0.27 \u00b1 0.01, or 1/b = 3.70 \u00b1 0.15. Thus, we interpret the baryonic TF relationship shown\nin Figure 7 as evidence that dwarf galaxies do not preferentially lose significant baryonic\nmass compared to luminous galaxies.\nFinally, we consider the residuals from the TF relationship. We define these residuals in terms of the ratio W 20i,t /W 20i,t(T F ), the corrected observed HI line-width divided\nby that expected from the fitted linear baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship. This quantity\nis defined in the sense that larger W 20i,t /W 20i,t(T F ) values correspond to lower inferred\nbaryon-to-dark matter ratios. Figure 8 shows this quantity as a function of projected nearest neighbor distance, color, gas fraction and axis ratio b/a. We find no correlation between\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nthese residuals and the axis-ratio b/a, except that the very flat galaxies (b/a < 0.25) never\nexhibit low W 20i,t/W 20i,t (T F ) ratios (Figure 8, bottom left panel). That no strong trend\nexists with axis-ratio suggests that the measured HI line-widths are properly sampling the\ngalactic potential. Dwarf galaxies with low gas fractions have low W 20i,t /W 20i,t(T F ) ratios. This suggests that low gas fraction dwarf galaxies, which are preferentially found in\ndense environments, have higher baryon-to-dark matter ratios compared to the majority of\ndwarfs in our sample. If, for example, reduced gas fractions in dense environments were due\nto interaction-induced star formation, we would expect these ratios to remain constant. If\nthis were due to ram pressure stripping alone one might expect this ratio to be lower in\ndense environments: gas stripping would preferentially remove baryonic mass, reducing the\nratio of baryons to dark matter. There is little correlation with color, indicating that if gas\nstripping is important, it is not directly effecting to the star-formation rates at the center.\nAlternatively, it is possible that this is simply a selection effect and the HI line-widths do not\nproperly sample the galactic potentials of the lowest gas fraction galaxies. As the number\nof observed galaxies in this mass range increase, the TF residuals should place significant\nconstraints on galaxy evolution processes important at these masses.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe present results from an HI survey of low luminosity dwarf galaxies in the absolute\nmagnitude range \u221213.5 > Mr \u2212 5 log10 h70 > \u221216 selected from the SDSS. These data represent the largest homogeneous sample of low luminosity dwarf galaxies with well-measured\nHI and optical properties. The sample spans a range of total baryonic masses between\nMbaryonic = 108 \u2212 109 M\u2299 with measured HI line-widths between hvrot i = hW20i,t/2i = 20 \u2212 80\nkm s\u22121 . The dwarf galaxies in this sample are found in a wide range of environments, from\ndense groups to truly isolated galaxies.\nFor the majority of our dwarf galaxy sample, the total galactic baryonic mass is dominated by the gas mass rather than stellar mass. The average gas fraction for our sample\nis hfgas i = 0.6, with gas fractions as high as 95%. This significantly exceeds that of gas-rich\ngalaxies at higher luminosities. Thus, dwarf galaxies are inefficient at turning gas into stars\ncompared to more luminous galaxies. We find that gas-rich galaxies have bluer g \u2212 r colors\ncompared to gas-poor objects implying that gas-rich dwarf galaxies have had more recent\nstar formation. The majority of galaxies in our sample are currently forming stars based on\nobserved H\u03b1 emission in the SDSS spectra. We find that the current rate of star formation\nper unit area (based on the total u-band flux) is not correlated with gas fraction, confirming\nprevious results suggesting that the star formation rates in dwarf galaxies are stochastic (van\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nZee 2001; Hunter & Elmegreen 2004). Thus, dwarf galaxies form stars with a rate that varies\nover million year time scales, but is correlated with the gas fraction over longer time periods.\nUsing the range of environments within our sample, we examine whether internal or\nexternal processes control the gas fractions of dwarf galaxies. Trends between galaxy properties, such as color or morphology, and environment have been well studied for galaxies at\nbrighter luminosities (Norberg et al. 2002; Blanton et al. 2005a), but have been previously\nlimited to the Local Group and nearby groups at dwarf luminosities (Grebel et al. 2003).\nOur sample allows us to quantify these trends for dwarf galaxies over a much wider range of\nenvironments. We find that dwarf galaxies with gas fractions fgas < 0.4, comprising 15% of\nthis sample, are exclusively found within 0.5 Mpc of a luminous neighbor galaxy. Galaxies\nwith gas fractions fgas > 0.4 are found across the full range of environments contained within\nthis sample. Thus, while internal galaxies processes can reduce the gas fractions, external\nprocesses are required to fully remove gas from a dwarf galaxy.\nThe optical Tully-Fisher relationship within our dwarf galaxy sample demonstrates considerable scatter. As previous work has shown for brighter samples (Bell & de Jong 2001;\nVerheijen 2001; Gurovich et al. 2004; McGaugh 2005), the baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship\nwithin our sample is much tighter. When we consider the Tully\u2013Fisher relationship across\nall absolute magnitudes, we find a logarithmic slope of b = 0.27 \u00b1 0.01 (or 1/b = 3.70 \u00b1 0.15).\nThese results are in accord with CDM predictions of 1/b \u223c 3.5 assuming no preferential\nloss of baryons as a function of mass (Bullock et al. 2001). Thus, our results suggest that\nprocesses which preferentially remove gas from dwarf galaxies are not important for the majority of galaxies in our sample with maximum rotation velocities vmax \u223c 20 \u2212 80 km s\u22121\n(roughly corresponding to total dynamical masses of Mtotal = 109 \u2212 1010 M\u2299 ).\nIf galaxies are associated one-to-one with \u039bCDM dark matter halos, the mass-to-light\nratios of galaxies must decline as a function of host halo mass (Benson et al. 2003). The most\nwell-known example of this problem is the Local Group \"substructure problem\" (Klypin et al.\n1999; Moore et al. 1999). To explain this trend in mass-to-light ratio, investigators often\ninvoke processes such as ram pressure stripping or supernova feedback that either removes gas\nor heats it sufficiently to prevent star-formation in low mass galaxies (e.g., Dekel & Silk 1986;\nDekel & Woo 2003; Mori & Burkert 2000; Bullock et al. 2000). Most semi-analytic models\nrequire significant baryonic mass loss (Cole et al. 2000; Benson et al. 2003; Croton et al.\n2005), predicting baryon-to-dark matter ratios for dwarf galaxies well below the \"Universal\"\nbaryon fraction (Read & Trentham 2005). Comparing the metallicity of galaxies over a\nwide range of baryonic masses, Tremonti et al. (2004) found that dwarfs are metal depleted\nrelative to massive galaxies and argue in favor of galactic winds efficiently removing enriched\nmaterial from low mass galaxies. However, at the masses of the galaxies in our sample,\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ndetailed models of the physics of gas blow-out and blow-away tend to disfavor significant\ngas mass loss, predicting loss of only a few percent (Mac Low & Ferrara 1999; Ferrara &\nTolstoy 2000). Our sample cannot rule out small amounts baryon mass loss from these\ngalaxies, nor scenarios in which gas remains bound to the galaxy but is blown away from the\nregion participating in star formation. This may explain the low observed metallicities of\ndwarf galaxies - enriched gas is removed from regions of active star formation, resulting in\nlow observed metallicities, but either remains bound or represents only a few percent of the\ntotal baryonic mass. Indeed, recent cosmological simulations which include realistic feedback\nand chemical evolution suggest that the metallicity, mass-to-light ratios and other galaxies\nproperties can be explained without including supernova energy feedback (Tassis et al. 2006).\nOur results favor such dwarf galaxy formation models in which processes such as supernovae\nwinds are not responsible for significant gas or baryon mass in low mass galaxies.\nWe thank David Weinberg and Rob Kennicutt for early and important encouragement\non this project.

Galaxy names are based on position in the Blanton et al. (2005) low luminosity SDSS catalog. Absolute magnitudes and g \u2212 r colors have been corrected for Galactic extinction based\non Schlegel et al. (1998). Distances are estimated based on a model of the local velocity field (Willick et al. 1997) and assume H0 = 70h70 Mpc km s\u22121 . The effective surface brightness (\u03bceff,r ),\neffective half-light radius (reff,r ) and axis ratio (b/a) are measured from the SDSS r-band images. Stellar masses are calculated based on Bell et al. (2003) and a Kroupa et al. (1993) initial mass\nfunction; HI masses are based on our Arecibo and GBT observations. The HI velocity half-width, W20/2, is the observed uncorrected 20% peak HI half-width. The quantity W20i,t /2 is the HI\nhalf-width corrected for inclination and turbulence as described in \u00a7 3.2. Errors on the HI mass (\u03c3M ) and HI line-width (\u03c3W 20 /2 ) were calculated from the scatter in the mean quantities\nHI\n\ni,t\n\nrecovered from Monte Carlo simulations.

The slope b is\n\u22121\nin units log10 (mass/108 h\u22122\n70 M\u2299 ) per log10 (W20i,t /2/(50 km s )). In the\n\u22122\nI-band Tully-Fisher relationship we replace log10 (mass/108 h70 M\u2299 ) with\nMI \u2212 5 log10 h70 + 20. The quantity \u03c3 represents the logarithmic (base\n10) scatter around each fit. The first two rows ('current sample') are\nfits to the galaxy data presented in this paper; the last two rows ('full\nsample') are fits to this sample plus data from the literature as desribed\nin \u00a7 3.2.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- SDSS r-band images and HI line-widths for three representative dwarf galaxies.\nThe images are 1\u2032 on a side. We list the absolute r-band magnitude and optically measured\naxis ratio (b/a) for each galaxy. Of the dwarf galaxy sample presented here, 18% have doublepeaked HI profiles similar to the top panel, 26% have flat-topped HI profiles, and 56% are\nsingle peaked profiles. If we consider only edge-on galaxies (b/a < 0.4), the percentage of\ndouble-peaked profiles increases to 30%. The distribution of HI profile shapes suggests that\nthe majority of dwarf galaxies in our sample have regular rotation fields.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The distribution (top left to bottom right) of absolute magnitude, distance, effective\nsurface brightness, effective half-light radius, S\u00e9rsic index and axis ratio for our dwarf galaxy\nsample. All photometric parameters are measured from the SDSS r-band images. Distances\nare estimated based on a model of the local velocity field (Willick et al. 1997). In each panel,\nwe list the average value of each quantity for the 101 dwarf galaxies in this sample.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The gas fraction, fgas = Mgas /(Mgas + Mstellar ), plotted as a function of absolute rband magnitude. The majority of dwarf galaxies in this paper (black circles) are dominated\nby the gas mass, rather than stellar mass, with gas fractions as high as 95%. Galaxies\nwhich were not detected in HI are plotted as upper limits. For comparison, we plot data\nfrom Schombert et al. (2001, squares), Bell & de Jong (2000, upward triangles) and Haynes\net al. (1999, downward triangles). We infer from this plot that, compared to more luminous\ngalaxies, dwarf galaxies are far less efficient at turning gas into stars over their lifetimes.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Top Left: The gas fraction, fgas , plotted as a function of g \u2212 r color. Assuming\nthe g \u2212 r color traces recent star-formation activity, the fraction of star-formation occurring in the recent past is higher for the gas-rich galaxies in our sample. Bottom Left: In\ncontrast, the current star formation rate per unit area, as measured by the SDSS u-band\nflux, is not correlated with gas fraction. Top Right: The gas fraction plotted against the\nprojected distance to the nearest luminous neighbor. Galaxies with gas fractions fgas < 0.4\nare preferentially found within 0.5 Mpc of a luminous neighbor galaxy. The gas fractions of\ngalaxies with fgas > 0.4 are uncorrelated with nearest neighbor distance. Bottom Right: We\nalso compare the g \u2212 r color and nearest neighbor distance distribution of our sample to that\nof the parent SDSS dwarf galaxy catalog (small black symbols).\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Left: The stellar birthrate timescale defined as Mstellar /SF Rtot . The median\nbirthrate timescale for this dwarf sample is 15 Gyr (black arrow). Assuming a single galaxy\nformation time of \u223c12 Gyr (grey arrow), roughly half the galaxies in our sample had lower\nstar formation rates and half have had higher rates in the past than presently observed. This\nsuggests that star formation in dwarfs is stochastic and that the current star formation rate\nis not necessarily representative of the time-average rate. Right: The large gas consumption\ntimescale (Mgas /SF Rtot ) suggests that the majority of galaxies will be able to make stars at\nthe current rates for another Hubble time.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The stellar mass, HI mass, and total baryonic mass plotted as a function of\nrotation velocity as measured by the inclination- and turbulence-corrected HI half line-widths\n(W20i,t /2). The solid line is the (inverse) regression fit described in \u00a7 3.2, whose parameters\nare quoted in Table 2. Each panel lists the correlation coefficient r between the two quantities;\nthe correlation coefficient is zero for two unrelated quantities and unity for two perfectly\nlinearly related quantities. The scatter in the stellar mass relationship (left) is much larger\ncompared to the HI (middle) and baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship (right).\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- The optical and baryonic Tully-Fisher relationships: absolute I-band luminosity\n(left) and the total baryonic mass (right) plotted as a function of maximum rotational velocity\n(W20i,t /2). We compare our dwarf galaxy sample to literature data for which HI and optical\nmeasurements are available: Haynes et al. (1999), Verheijen (2001), Matthews et al. (1998),\nand McGaugh et al. (2000). The line in each panel is the fit we describe in the text. The\nslope in the right-hand panel b = 0.27 \u00b1 0.01 is consistent with the CDM prediction b \u223c 0.29\n(Bullock et al. 2001).\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Residuals from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship, defined as the ratio\nW 20i,t/W 20i,t (T F ) of the actual line width to the expected line width from the Tully-Fisher\nrelationship. We show this ratio versus nearest neighbor distance, g \u2212 r color, gas fraction\nfgas and optical axis ratio b/a.\n\n\f"}
