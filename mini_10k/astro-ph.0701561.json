Continual mass loss has a significant impact on the evolution of the stars\nthemselves, on surrounding planetary systems, and on the overall mass and\nenergy budget of the interstellar medium (see reviews by Dupree 1986; Lamers\n& Cassinelli 1999; Willson 2000). We would like to understand how stellar wind\nproperties depend on the fundamental stellar parameters and to identify the\nphysical processes that drive the winds. Observations are key, of course, and\nrecent advances in measuring the plasma properties of our own solar wind (via\nboth remote sensing and in-situ probes) have been helpful. There is a well-known\nmismatch, though, between the most basic property of the solar wind (it's mass\nloss rate: \u1e40 \u2248 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) and corresponding values for detectable outflows\nfrom other stars (\u1e40 > 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , typically). Solar-type winds are just too\ntenuous to make much of an impact on star-integrated photon signatures.\nThe goal of this paper is to summarize a cross-section of observational and\ntheoretical work that is improving our understanding of the low-density winds\nfrom solar-type (cool, main-sequence) stars.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCranmer\n\nFigure 1. Time variation of solar mass loss rate computed in two ways:\nWang's (1998) full-Sun reconstruction (solid curve, 1976\u20131997), and instantaneous mass fluxes from the product of in-situ densities and velocities, from\nthe SWEPAM instrument on ACE (points, 1998\u20132006).\n\n2.\n\nThe Solar Wind\n\nThe last decade has seen significant progress toward identifying and characterizing the processes that heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind\n(see, e.g., Cranmer 2002, 2004; Kohl et al. 2006; Aschwanden 2006; Klimchuk\n2006). It seems increasingly clear that closed magnetic loops in the low corona\nare heated by small-scale, intermittent magnetic reconnection that is driven by\nthe continual stressing of their footpoints by convective motions. The open field\nlines that reach into interplanetary space, though, appear to be energized by the\ndissipation of waves and turbulent motions (also driven ultimately by convection). Parker's (1958) classical paradigm of solar wind acceleration via the gas\npressure gradient in a hot (T \u223c 106 K) corona still seems to be the dominant\nmechanism, though waves and turbulence have an impact as well. Clues about\nthe detailed process of turbulent heating have come from UV spectroscopy of\nthe extended corona (i.e., using a combination of an occulting coronagraph and\na spectrometer). There is evidence for preferential acceleration of heavy ions in\nthe fast solar wind, ion temperatures exceeding 108 K, and marked departures\nfrom Maxwellian velocity distributions-all of which point to specific types of\ncollisionless kinetic processes at the end of the turbulent cascade.\nThe Sun-integrated mass loss rate \u1e40 is a quantity that is not often considered by solar physicists, since both telescopic and in-situ measurements typically\nresolve much smaller volumes of plasma at a time. It is possible to use in-situ\nmeasurements of the density \u03c1 and flow speed v to estimate a time-dependent\nmass flux \u1e40 = 4\u03c0\u03c1vr 2 (as if the entire heliosphere is identical to the measured\nparcel). Average values tend to fall around 2 \u00d7 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , with the majority of data points falling within about a factor of 3 of this value (i.e., the \u00b12\u03c3\nrange is between 0.6 and 6 \u00d7 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ); see Figure 1. Wang (1998) used\nsome well-known empirical correlations between the plasma properties measured\nat 1 AU and the coronal magnetic field geometry (the latter extrapolated from\nphotospheric fields) to reconstruct a sphere-integrated value of \u1e40 over two solar\n\n\fWinds of Main-Sequence Stars\n\n3\n\ncycles. He found this \"true\" mass loss rate to vary only by about 50%, from 2\nto 3 \u00d7 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , with lower [higher] values at solar minimum [maximum].\nThe Sun's mass flux is generally believed to be determined in the thin\ntransition region between the chromosphere and corona by a balance between\ndownward conduction (from the corona), upward enthalpy flux (from the chromosphere), and local radiative losses (e.g., Hammer 1982; Withbroe 1988; Leer\net al. 1998; Leer & Marsch 1999). Essentially, more coronal heating implies more\nmass loss. Alternate ideas, such as Alfv\u00e9n wave pressure acceleration (Holzer\net al. 1983) and a dynamic balance between ionization and recombination in\nthe chromosphere (Peter & Marsch 1997), have an impact on the mass flux but\ndo not seem to be the dominant drivers. From a modeling perspective, it has\nbeen realized that it is key to resolve the full range of radii-from the nearly\nhydrostatic chromosphere to the supersonic wind-in order to simulate a selfconsistent flow along the open flux tube.\n3.\n\nCool-Star Mass Loss Rates\n\nFigure 2 shows a summary of \u1e40 determinations from a wide variety of stars. The\nsources of these data are given below; when Teff or L\u2217 were not provided, they\nwere determined from spectral types and luminosity classes using the relations of\nde Jager & Nieuwenhuijzen (1987). Uncertainty limits are not shown in Figure\n2, but it is clear that the sources of potential error increase dramatically as the\nmethods grow increasingly model-dependent. By necessity, this occurs as the\nderived values of \u1e40 decrease. Note also that Figure 2 omits observations of\n\"bursty\" mass loss episodes (implied for, e.g., some M-dwarf flare stars; Mullan\net al. 1992) as well as jets associated with interacting binaries; the goal is to\ninclude only time-steady mass loss from individual stars.\nThe circles in Figure 2 correspond to the de Jager et al. (1988) database of\nevolved stars, with mass loss rates derived largely from four main techniques:\n1. Optical and UV spectroscopy: Blueshifted absorption lines probe the column of outflowing gas in front of the stellar disk. If the wind is dense\nenough, there may also be a line-centered emission component indicative\nof \"off-limb\" expansion; i.e., a P Cygni profile. If the wind is too tenuous, the line opacity is dominated by the more-or-less static photosphere.\nFor most lines, deriving \u1e40 is possible only in combination with a model\natmosphere having an assumed ionization balance.\n2. IR continuum excess: For cool stars, circumstellar dust gives rise to a\nmeasurable continuum enhancement in the infrared. The gas-to-dust ratio\nand the outflow speed must be assumed in order to obtain \u1e40 .\n3. Molecular lines: For the densest outflows (\u1e40 > 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), molecular emission lines (from, e.g., CO, OH, CN, CS) at mm and sub-mm\nwavelengths have provided accurate outflow speeds and mass loss rates\nin the \"shells\" far from the parent stars. Sometimes enough information\nis present to piece together details about the mass loss histories of some\nstars-i.e., more than just the first derivative of M\u2217 (t).\n\n\f4\n\nCranmer\n\nFigure 2.\nCompilation of cool-star mass loss rates, plotted against stellar\nluminosity (abscissa) and effective temperature (symbol grayscale). Circles:\nevolved stars (de Jager et al. 1988), diamonds: T Tauri stars (Hartigan et\nal. 1995), squares: newer results from spectroscopy (see text), up-pointing\ntriangles: nearby stars with astrospheres (Wood et al. 2002, 2004, 2005),\ndown-pointing triangles: pre-CV M dwarfs (Debes 2006). The measured range\nof the Sun's mass loss rate is shown with a thick error bar, and semi-empirical\nrates from the Schr\u00f6der & Cuntz (2005) law are shown with gray curves (left\nto right: luminosity classes V, III, and Iab).\n\n4. Radio continuum excess: Ionized plasma in an outflowing atmosphere\nemits in the radio via bremsstrahlung. The ionization state and the outflow\nspeed must be assumed in order to obtain \u1e40 .\nFor more information on these techniques, see references cited by de Jager et al.\n(1988) and Judge & Stencel (1991).\nIn the 1990s, more self-consistent analyses of visible and UV spectra began\nto be performed, thanks to both increasingly sophisticated radiative transfer\nmodels and better data (e.g., FUSE, GHRS/HST, and high spectral resolution\nground-based instruments). The squares in Figure 2 highlight \u1e40 determinations\nfrom Dupree et al. (1990, 2005), Harper et al. (1995), Robinson et al. (1998),\nCarpenter et al. (1999), and Lobel & Dupree (2000). Also included are several\nadditional values of \u1e40 from Judge & Stencel (1991) determined using the above\ntraditional techniques, which do not overlap with the de Jager et al. (1988)\ndatabase (and are not chemically peculiar). The diamonds in Figure 2 illustrate\n\n\fWinds of Main-Sequence Stars\n\n5\n\noutflows from T Tauri stars as determined from optical forbidden line profiles\n(Hartigan et al. 1995).\nMore recently, several other new diagnostic techniques have been explored\nthat attempt to push the lower limit of detectability down past the solar mass\nloss rate. Wood et al. (2002, 2004, 2005) used high-resolution HST spectra of\nH I Ly\u03b1 lines from nearby stars to characterize the properties of their so-called\n\"astrospheres.\" The interaction between a fully ionized stellar wind and the\npartially ionized local interstellar medium (LISM) gives rise to a dense concentration of neutral hydrogen atoms between the bow shock and astropause. This\n\"hydrogen wall\" (T \u2248 30, 000 K) is hotter than the exterior LISM gas (T \u2248 8000\nK) and thus shows up as an absorption component on the blue side of the H I\nLy\u03b1 line. The density in the hydrogen wall is proportional to the wind's mass\nloss rate, and Wood et al. (2002, 2004, 2005) have calibrated this diagnostic\nusing multi-fluid hydrodynamic models. The up-pointing triangles in Figure 2\nshow the derived mass loss rates from Wood et al. (2004). These \u1e40 determinations are are somewhat controversial, though, because they depend sensitively\non: (1) astrosphere models that cannot be verified for the individual stars, and\n(2) modeled interstellar absorption in the core and wings of the intrinsic (and\nunobserved) stellar Ly\u03b1 profile. Improvements in the dynamical and radiative\ntransfer models should help reduce the uncertainties.\nAnother new technique for determining the mass loss rates of some M dwarfs\nin pre-cataclysmic-variable binary systems was suggested by Debes (2006). Some\nH-rich white dwarfs show metal lines in their atmospheric spectra that would be\ndifficult to maintain (against downward diffusion) if the metal-rich gas were not\nbeing continually accreted. Debes (2006) computed the accretion rates by comparing the observed strengths of Ca II H and K lines to models that predict the\nbalance between mass addition and downward Ca \"settling.\" The inter-binary\ndensity is then computed by assuming the accretion takes place via standard\nBondi-Hoyle transonic flow, and this density is then used to compute the companion star's mass loss rate. The wind speed v is an assumed quantity in this\nanalysis, and the derived mass loss rate depends sensitively on v 4 . The downpointing triangles in Figure 2 show derived \u1e40 values for the three close binaries\nanalyzed by Debes (2006). The three other (wider) binary systems studied by\nDebes (2006) have much larger inferred mass loss rates, but these values are\nuncertain to within at least 2 orders of magnitude, and there are inconsistencies\nbetween these values and the evolutionary histories of these systems that lend\ndoubt to the results.\nFinally, there is another suggested technique that at present has yielded only\nupper limits on mass loss rates. Wargelin & Drake (2001, 2002) suggested that\nthe winds of nearby dwarf stars may be detectable via X-rays induced by charge\nexchange. Interstellar hydrogen flows into stellar astrospheres and undergoes\ncharge exchange with ions in the supersonic wind; these ions are left in an\nexcited state and emit X-rays. Because the charge exchange rate is proportional\nto the product of the ions' density and velocity, the X-ray emission is sensitive\nto the stellar mass loss rate. With good enough spatial and spectral resolution\n(which may not be achievable until the Generation-X mission) this diagnostic\ncan also be used to constrain the wind's velocity, elemental composition, and\nionization state.\n\n\f6\n4.\n\nCranmer\nCoronal Heating: A Link Between Theory and Observation?\n\nTheoretical explanations for cool-star mass loss tend to follow various components of the energy flux from the stellar interior up through the atmosphere.\nReimers (1975, 1977) assumed the stellar wind luminosity (or wind power) remains proportional to the bolometric photon luminosity as cool stars evolve; i.e.,\nthat\n2\nLwind\n\u1e40 Vesc\nGM\u2217 \u1e40\n\u2248\n\u2248\n\u2248 constant.\n(1)\nL\u2217\nL\u2217\nL \u2217 R\u2217\nSchr\u00f6der & Cuntz (2005) obtained a similar relation by assuming that the wind's\nenergy flux is set by the turbulent transfer of subphotospheric convective energy\nto photospheric wave motions (see the curves in Figure 2 for a comparison between the observed \u1e40 values and those from the Schr\u00f6der & Cuntz scaling law).\nModels of wave generation from turbulent convection have been used to model\nchromospheric and coronal heating in the Sun and other stars.\nThe connections between coronal heating and stellar winds can be utilized to\nobtain a better empirical understanding of mass loss. The primary observational\nsignature of coronal heating-X-ray emission-is seen in a much larger fraction\nof cool stars than those that have measured mass loss rates. As models of the\nsolar corona and wind improve in sophistication and become less dependent on\nfree parameters, it may be possible to extend them to other stars and determine\n(albeit still in a model-dependent way) consistent ranges of wind properties for\nstars with measured X-ray fluxes.\nTaking the assumption that coronal heating causes mass loss, there appear\nto be two primary roadblocks in the way of producing reliable models for solartype stars:\n1. Mass loss proceeds along open magnetic flux tubes, but the dominant Xray emission comes from closed magnetic loops. For very active stars, is\nthere any hope of extracting the X-ray signature of just the \"dim\" open\nregions? If the heating in the open regions is related causally to the (more\nobservable) heating in the closed regions, though, the latter may scale\nwith the former. A combination of diagnostics-not just X-rays-appears\nto be needed in order to put separate constraints on the open and closed\nmagnetic regions.1\n2. For the open flux tubes, there is still disagreement in the solar community\non the extent that coronal heating is driven by \"magnetic activity\" (i.e.,\nsimply proportional to some positive power of the magnetic flux at the base\nof the corona) or by the wave fluxes at the stellar surface (presumably\ndetermined by convection). Cranmer et al. (2007) produced a model of\nchromospheric and coronal heating along open flux tubes that reproduces\na wide range of observations of fast and slow solar wind streams; these\nmodels depend on a combination of the magnetic and wave parameters\n1\n\nThe situation is even more complicated for T Tauri stars, for which the open flux tubes may\ncontain either outflowing wind or inflowing accretion material (see, e.g., Feigelson & Montmerle\n1999; Matt & Pudritz 2005; Dupree et al., these proceedings).\n\n\fWinds of Main-Sequence Stars\n\n7\n\n(see also Schwadron & McComas 2003; Suzuki 2006a). Rapidly rotating\nactive stars appear to have stronger magnetic fields than the Sun (e.g.,\nSaar 2001) and they may also have more vigorous convection (K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 et\nal. 2006; Brown et al. 2007).\nAn interesting testbed for the above issues is the age dependence of solar-type\nstars-i.e., the \"Sun in time.\" Figure 3a shows a selection of X-ray luminosities\n(in units of the stars' bolometric luminosities) as a function of age. The LX\nvalues were either measured in the ROSAT/PSPC-like 0.1\u20132.4 keV band or\nconverted into that band. Values from individual stars were taken from G\u00fcdel\net al. (1998) and Garc\u0131\u0301a-Alvarez et al. (2005); the cluster means come from\nPreibisch & Feigelson (2005) and Jeffries et al. (2006). The solar range of values\n(error bar at t = 4.6 Gyr) is from Judge et al. (2003). The fit shown with a\ndashed line is given by\nLX\n4.48 \u00d7 10\u22124\n=\n.\nLbol\n1 + (12.76 tGyr )1.79\n\n(2)\n\nFigure 3. (a) X-ray luminosity versus age for solar-type stars (asterisks)\nand nearby clusters (squares); see text for details. (b) Modeled solar mass\nloss history, anchored to the present-day range, where dashed curves assume\n\u1e40 \u221d (LX /Lbol )\u03bc , with \u03bc = 0.1, 0.4, 1.0, 1.3 (bottom to top), and solid curves\nare the \"optimal\" modeled histories from Sackmann & Boothroyd (2003).\n\nThere have been several attempts to scale mass loss rates with stellar X-ray\nfluxes FX (or luminosities LX ) and with magnetic field fluxes \u03a6. The latter\ntwo quantities are well-known to be nearly linearly correlated for the Sun, over\nthe solar cycle, as well as for a range of other cool stars; i.e., FX \u221d \u03a6\u03b1 , with\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.9\u20131.1 (e.g., Pevtsov et al. 2003; Schrijver et al. 2003). Astrospheric mass\nloss rates were used by Wood et al. (2002, 2004, 2005) to correlate FX with \u1e40 .\n\n\f8\n\nCranmer\n\nValues of the scaling exponent \u1e40 \u221d FX\u03bc ranged from \u03bc \u2248 1 to 1.3 depending\non the subset of stars used in the correlation. The Wood et al. database was\nanalyzed in a different way by Holzwarth & Jardine (2007), who found a weaker\nrelationship between FX and \u1e40 (\u03bc \u2248 0.5) by constructing fast-magnetic-rotator\ntype models of the winds and separating out several K dwarfs from the sample\nthat appear to have anomalously high mass loss rates.\nSmall values of \u03bc can also be derived by returning to the solar analogy.\nNote that the Sun's total mass loss rate varies relatively weakly over the solar\ncycle (i.e., by about 50%, as computed by Wang 1998), whereas its magnetic\nflux varies by at least two orders of magnitude over the cycle. Schwadron et\nal. (2006) separated the magnetic flux variation into \"active region\" (AR) and\n\"quiet Sun\" (QS) components based on magnetic field models. For the years\nbetween 1985 and 1997, we cross-correlated the Wang (1998) mass loss data\nagainst the Schwadron et al. (2006) magnetic flux curves. Assuming \u03b1 = 1 (to\nconvert \u03a6 into FX ), we found \u03bc \u2248 0.1 for AR, and \u03bc \u2248 0.4 for QS. In a sense,\nthese are \"apples-and-oranges\" comparisons, since the closed-field AR and QS\nregions do not connect directly to the solar wind. Schwadron et al. (2006) also\ncomputed the \"coronal hole\" (i.e., open field) component of the magnetic field,\nbut did not show the considerably weaker FX or \u03a6 variations that would be\nattributed to these regions. Presumably these would exhibit \u03bc closer to unity.\nFigure 3b shows a reconstruction of the Sun's mass loss history by taking\neq. (2) and simply assuming that \u1e40 \u221d (LX /Lbol )\u03bc for the range of \u03bc estimates\ndiscussed above. Also shown are hypothetical mass loss histories of the Sun\nthat were constructed by Sackmann & Boothroyd (2003) to solve the so-called\n\"faint young Sun problem\" (e.g., Sonett et al. 1991) by positing a higher initial\nmass for the Sun (1.01\u20131.07 M\u2299 ). It is difficult to reconcile these mass loss\nhistories with the (substantially lower) values computed from the above range\nof \u03bc exponents.\nHowever, implicit in the FX\u03bc scaling laws used above is the assumption\nthat the strength of the young Sun's subphotospheric convection is essentially\nindependent of age and activity. The validity of this assumption remains to be\nseen. Standard stellar evolution models do not include any substantial rotation\ndependence in their prescriptions for convection, but numerical simulations like\nthose of Brown et al. (2007) are beginning to show that rapid rotation creates\nmore intermittent or \"patchy\" convection with sites of substantially stronger\nturbulent motion than the present-day solar case. Open magnetic field lines that\nfeed the stellar wind are jostled by waves whose amplitudes scale directly with\nthe peak convective velocity, and the mass loss rate depends on the deposition\nof this wave energy in the upper atmosphere (e.g., Cranmer et al. 2007).\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nConsiderable progress has been made over the last several decades in increasing\nour understanding of the physics of cool-star winds. Much of this progress has\ncome about because of cross-fertilization between the solar and stellar communities, as well as between theorists and observers. The diagnostic techniques\ndescribed in \u00a7 3 for obtaining mass loss rates continue to be developed and extended as the data accumulate and improve in quality. Extrasolar planet studies\n\n\fWinds of Main-Sequence Stars\n\n9\n\nare helping to accelerate this observational renaissance as well, since they are\nresulting in both a dramatic increase in data quantity and in new indirect probes\nof stellar wind acceleration regions.2\nTheoretical models of stellar atmospheres and winds are advancing rapidly.\nArtificial features of past models, such as parameterized \"coronal heating functions\" and wave damping lengths, are now being replaced by more self-consistent\nand self-regulating physical processes (e.g., Dmitruk et al. 2002; Gudiksen 2005;\nSuzuki 2006a, 2006b; Cranmer & van Ballegooijen 2005; Cranmer et al. 2007).\nIn order for such models to be applied to a range of cool stars, though, both\nthe subphotospheric convection dynamics and the magnetic field strength and\ngeometry must be better constrained. These properties are difficult to observe\ndirectly, but the ongoing cross-pollination between the observational and theoretical communities continues to provide new insight.\nAcknowledgments.

Some observed\nchromospheric enhancements appear to be phased with the planet's orbit (e.g., Shkolnik et al.\n2005) and seem to signal flare-like energy releases due to the interaction between the stellar\nand planetary magnetic fields. As these observations improve there is hope that both the field\ngeometries and the stellar wind properties can be probed far from the stellar surfaces (Saar et\nal. 2004; Preusse et al. 2006; Cranmer & Saar, these proceedings).\n\n\f10\n\nCranmer\n\nHartigan, P., Edwards, S., & Ghandour, L. 1995, ApJ, 452, 736\nHolzer, T.
