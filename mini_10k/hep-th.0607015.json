Introduction\nClassifying the full space of string theory vacua is an enormous problem. For any given\nstring theory, there is a broad range of possible compactification geometries. Imposing supersymmetry simplifies the problem somewhat, and for many years attention\nwas focused on Calabi-Yau manifolds as the primary structure needed for supersymmetric compactification of string theory. In recent years, however, more and more\nattention has focused on compactifications including fluxes of various p-form fields on\ntopologically nontrivial cycles of the compactification manifold [1, 2, 3]. This has led\nto the realization that a broader class of manifolds are needed even for supersymmetric\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fcompactifications [4, 5]. It is possible, however, that concrete realizations of compactifications explored to date only scratch the surface of the full range of possibilities.\nIn general, supersymmetric compactification on a Calabi-Yau or other related manifold with fluxes leads to a gauged supergravity theory in four dimensions. In many\ngauged supergravity theories, the parameters associated with the gauging of the supergravity can be identified in this way with fluxes on a compactification manifold or\nwith certain features of the geometry of the compactification manifold [6, 7, 8]. In\nother cases, however, it is not known how to interpret the gauging parameters in ten\ndimensions. It is possible that in some cases such gaugings are the result of compactifications on nongeometric string backgrounds [9, 10]. Thus, while many interesting\nfour-dimensional solutions, including stable de Sitter vacua [11], may be realized in\neffective four-dimensional supergravity theories, we often do not know how to interpret\nthese solutions in terms of ten-dimensional string theory.\nWhen two ten-dimensional theories are related through a duality symmetry, such\nas T-duality or mirror symmetry, we have a situation where a given four-dimensional\neffective theory may be derived in two different ways. In this case, gauging parameters\nwhich have a natural interpretation as fluxes in one picture may not have a known\ninterpretation in the dual picture. The existence of one picture in which these gauging\nparameters can be understood in ten dimensions, however, suggests that these parameters should be allowed to take nonzero values in a more general context, and that it\nmay be possible to turn on arbitrary combinations of these parameters even when there\nis no single picture in which they all have a known interpretation. This observation has\nmotivated analysis of the duality transformation properties of the gauging parameters\nin four-dimensional supergravity theories [12]. In [9], we considered a simple example\nof this situation, namely, a toroidal orientifold in Type II string theory. We derived\nthe four-dimensional superpotential for this toroidal orientifold, including NS-NS and\nR-R fluxes in both the IIA and IIB theories. These fluxes give rise to different subsets of the set of possible gaugings of the four-dimensional model. We argued that to\nhave a class of models which are invariant under duality, it was natural to include a\nfull duality-invariant set of gauging parameters. When we consider T-duality transformations on the toroidal orientifold, the duality-invariant set of gauging parameters\nincludes integers which appear as T-duals of NS-NS 3-form flux H. These integers can\nbe interpreted as parameterizing twists on the torus, often called \"geometric flux\" (as\ncan be found after one T-duality using the Buscher rules [13]) and as generalized fluxes\n(after two or three T-dualities). 1\nThese generalized fluxes can be referred to as \"nongeometric,\" in the sense that\n1\n\nHere the word \"generalized\" is not used in the sense of \"generalized geometry\" [5]. We use it\ninstead to describe essentially topological structures which are related to p-form flux under duality.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fwhen they are present in the absence of other fluxes, they describe backgrounds with\nno global (or possibly even local) geometric interpretation. There is so far no complete worldsheet description of spaces with these fluxes as string backgrounds, but one\nproposal for a stringy construction of these fluxes has been described by Hull [14] and\nexplored by several authors at both the classical [15, 16, 17] and quantum [18] levels.\nWhile simple combinations of geometric and generalized fluxes may have a string interpretation along these lines, when sufficiently complicated combinations of fluxes are\nincluded, we have as yet no concrete idea of how to lift the resulting four-dimensional\nphysics to a full string compactification. While we touch on this issue here, for the\nmost part we simply treat the fluxes as parameters in the four-dimensional effective\ntheory. Other approaches to the worldsheet description of nongeometric backgrounds\ninclude asymmetric orbifolds [19, 20], and a recent generalization [21]. We do not expect, however, that the backgrounds described in the present work have an asymmetric\norbifold description.\nIn this paper we consider the four-dimensional theory with this general set of fluxes\nand solve the tree-level supergravity equations. We find classes of vacua in which the\nstring coupling g and cosmological constant \u039b are parametrically controlled. These\nvacua are reminiscent of the parametrically controlled IIA vacua described in [22],\nalthough in that case there was an explicit picture of the vacua as ten-dimensional\ncompactifications on a large radius Calabi-Yau manifold. Here, we do not have a tendimensional picture of how these vacua should be interpreted, and likely have no control\nover \u03b1\u2032 corrections. Indeed, the structure of the fluxes suggests that to construct a complete lift of these solutions to a string compactification may require the introduction of\nadditional light fields. Because the fluxes capture some essentially topological features\nof the theory, however, we believe that the existence of these parametrically controlled\nSUSY vacua points to some new class of either geometric or nongeometric string vacua\nwhich we may understand more clearly in due course.\nIn addition to demonstrating parametrically controlled vacua, we will also study\nthe broad features of the general supersymmetric solutions in this model. The generic\nsolutions stabilize all moduli at tree level, and are not equivalent to known purely\ngeometric compactifications in any duality frame. We find that our toroidal model\npossesses an apparently infinite number of (tree-level) solutions in finite ranges of parameter space. This somewhat surprising result seems to contradict recent predictions\nregarding properties of the string landscape [23, 24], though as we will discuss there are\nsome reasons why the solutions we find may not correspond to stable nonperturbative\nvacua in a complete string theory framework.\nIn Section 2 we review the construction of the superpotential for the dimensionally\nreduced four-dimensional theory on the toroidal orientifold, including generalized fluxes.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fWe give a suggestive new concise description of the constraints on consistent generalized\nfluxes in terms of a generalized derivative operator. In Section 3 we give the equations\nof motion and briefly discuss some simple classes of solutions. In Section 4 we describe\ntwo two-parameter families of parametrically controlled SUSY vacua, and in Section\n5 we briefly describe the statistics of more general vacua. Section 6 contains some\nconcluding remarks.\n\n2. Review and Preview\n2.1 Generalized Fluxes\nIn [9] we identified a set of NS-NS \"fluxes\" on the torus, which can individually be obtained from the usual three-form H-flux by T-duality. T-duality acts on the integrated\nNS-NS fluxes according to the chain\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nc\na\nb\nabc\nQab\n.\nH\u0304abc \u2190\u2192\nfbca \u2190\u2192\nc \u2190\u2192 R\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere H\u0304abc is the integer number of units of H-flux on the (abc)-cycle of the torus. The\n\"geometric flux\" fbca characterizes the field strengths of a basis of one-forms \u03b7 a satisfying\nd\u03b7 a = fbca \u03b7 b \u2227 \u03b7 c .\n\n(2.2)\n\nDifferentiating (2.2) yields a Jacobi identity, and thus the fbca may be viewed as the\nstructure constants for a Lie algebra. The one-forms \u03b7 a can be related to both the\ngenerators of the isometry group of the compactification manifold and to a basis for\nits frame bundle. When the Lie algebra defined by the fbca is nilpotent, the \u03b7 a can\nbe constructed explicitly, and the geometric flux can be straightforwardly interpreted\nas adding twists to an underlying torus. When the algebra is not nilpotent, then the\ncompact space is less closely related to the torus, and from the four-dimensional point\nof view the lift to ten dimensions is more subtle [7]; we will return to this point below.\nFollowing the T-duality chain of equation (2.1), acting on fbca with an additional\nT-duality in the direction b takes us to the nongeometric structure characterized by\n2\nQab\nFor a torus with N units of such a Q-flux, and no other NS-NS fluxes, fields are\nc .\nperiodic only up to an identification which mixes geometric data with the (integrated)\nB-field, and R-R p-forms of differing degree with each other. While the resulting\ncompactification has a geometric description locally, the transition functions render\nthe global description nongeometric.\n2\n\nStrictly speaking, the isometry in the direction b is not globally defined, but it seems that the\nT-duality in this direction can be understood, at least in the dimensionally reduced theory, in terms\nof an orbifold by a combination of a shift and a T-duality symmetry; see also [16].\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fFinally, the last step in the T-duality chain is a formal T-duality on c, taking us\nto an object Rabc . This is the NS-NS analogue of the R-R T-duality rule which takes\nTx\nF\u0304x \u2190\u2192\nF0 . A compactification with R-flux has apparently no geometric description,\neven locally. A heuristic argument for this lack of local geometry goes as follows:\nConsider a T 3 with nonzero H flux. It is not possible to wrap a D3-brane on this T 3\nfor the simple reason that turning on H-flux would give a nonzero Bianchi identity for\nthe gauge field living on the D3-brane, dF2 = H3 6= 0. T-dualizing this configuration\nonce would give a D2-brane on a twisted torus. However, the 2-cycle the D2-brane\nshould wrap no longer exists in the integer homology of the twisted torus. Thus, like\nthe original D3-brane, this D2-brane can not exist. If these branes cannot exist, neither\ncan the D0-brane one would get by performing two more T-dualities. This indicates an\napparent lack of the notion of spacetime points on a T 3 with R-flux. It is in this sense\nthat we say that the R-flux gives a background which is not even locally geometric. A\nfurther discussion of the properties of branes in backgrounds with nongeometric fluxes\nappears in [17].\nWe need some understanding of how to combine these generalized flux objects in\na consistent manner. These new structures introduce new terms in the NS-NS Bianchi\nidentities and the R-R tadpoles/Bianchi identities. The need to satisfy Bianchi identities and tadpole cancellation conditions constrains the admissible fluxes in a general\ncompactification. For the R-R fluxes, the constraints found in [9] can be written concisely as\n(H\u0304 \u2227 +f * +Q * +Rx)F\u0304 = 0.\n(2.3)\nHere F\u0304 is the formal sum of the integrated R-R field strengths, and we have used the\nnotation\n(2.4)\nRx\u03c9 (p) \u2261 Rabc \u03c9abca4 ...ap\nin addition to\na\nf * \u03c9 (p) = f[bc\n\u03c9|a|a2 ...ap ] ,\n\nQ * \u03c9 (p) = Qab\n[c \u03c9|ab|a3 ...ap ] ,\n\n(2.5)\n\ncontracting all upper indices and antisymmetrizing all uncontracted lower indices. This\nis the natural action of a mixed tensor on a p-form. Recalling that the standard\nR-R tadpoles/Bianchi identities can be written in terms of an H-twisted differential\noperator,\n(d + H\u2227)F \u2261 dH F = 0,\n(2.6)\nthe constraints (2.3) have a suggestive interpretation as the action of an operator defined\nby acting with all generalized NS-NS fluxes, 3\nD \u2261 H \u2227 +f * +Q * +Rx\n3\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn (2.3), there is no term corresponding to the derivative operator d; this is because we have\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fon the R-R fluxes F\u0304 ,\nD F\u0304 = 0.\n\n(2.8)\n\nMoreover, just as the usual Bianchi identity for H,\ndH = 0,\n\n(2.9)\n\ncan be understood as the condition that the twisted differential dH \u2261 d + H\u2227 be\nnilpotent, the entire set of NS-NS constraints, including the contributions from all\ngeneralized fluxes, are equivalent to a nilpotency condition\nD 2 = (H \u2227 +f * +Q * +Rx)2 = 0.\n\n(2.10)\n\nIn addition to the (bilinear) generalized Bianchi identities for the NS-NS fluxes, (2.10)\na\nalso incorporates the (linear) \"tracelessness\" conditions fab\n= 0 = Qab\na .\nNow that we have rewritten the constraints in a more covariant form as (2.3),\n(2.10), we have eliminated the explicit dependence on a particular choice of coordinate\nsystem. This provides a natural point of departure for considering these nongeometric\nstructures on manifolds more complicated than the torus, though we do not pursue this\nfurther here. Discussion of the two-fold T -dual of H-flux in the context of Calabi-Yau\ncompactification can be found in [25].\nWhile any individual nongeometric flux is T-dual to H-flux and has a reasonably\nstraightforward interpretation as discussed above, a general combination of geometric\nand nongeometric fluxes can never be brought to a description in terms of conventional\nfluxes in any duality frame, and may be more difficult to interpret. Furthermore, when\nmultiple fluxes are combined, the nature of the compactification manifold may change\ndramatically. For example, including \"geometric fluxes\" fbca which give rise to an algebra\nwhich is not nilpotent gives rise to a space in which the fluxes no longer have the same\ninterpretation as geometric twists. A simple example of this is compactification on\nS 3 , which produces f 's which are the structure constants of SU(2) [7]. Performing a\nT-duality on the fiber of the Hopf fibration of S 3 effectively performs a T-duality on\none of the indices of the f 's and gives a space which can be described geometrically as\nS 1 \u00d7 S 2 with one unit of H flux [26]. By formally raising and lowering the indices on\nthe f 's, however, we see that this compactification should be described by fluxes which\nwe would label as one H and two Q's 4 . While this background is not a solution of the\nintegrated the differential expression to obtain a topological formula. The contraction with f contains\nthe information coming from d when the forms are expressed in terms of the invariant basis \u03b7 a on, for\nexample, a twisted torus. We expect that some generalization of these formulas should hold without\nintegration, in which case there should be additional local contributions from d, though it is not clear\nwhat this should mean when the compactification space is not a manifold.\n4\nWe would like to thank David Marks for pointing out this example to us.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fequations of motion and is not supersymmetric, it suggests that when the algebra is\nnot nilpotent, the question of lifting the background to ten dimensions becomes more\nsubtle, and that we should be cautious in our assumptions about which backgrounds\nare geometric and which are not.\nTo be clear, in this paper we will consider a four-dimensional effective theory with\na specific form for the superpotential. Each individual term in the superpotential has\na clear interpretation in terms of some individual (generalized) flux on an underlying\ntorus, in the absence of other fluxes. However, for the explicit solutions we find, the\ngauge algebra of the resulting theory is not nilpotent, and thus the lift of these solutions\nto ten dimensions is not straightforward. While the individual fluxes appearing in\nour superpotential may have nongeometric interpretations, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that there may be a completely geometric description of these vacua in ten\ndimensions. For simplicity, we will continue to use the language of flux compactification\non a torus, but the reader should bear these caveats in mind.\n2.2 A simple model: the symmetric T 6 /Z2 orientifold\nIn this paper we will carry out the study of generalized flux compactifications on the\nsimple symmetric torus orientifold (T 2 )3 /Z2 which we initiated in [9]. As in [9], the\nunderlying compactification we consider is type II on a T 6 orientifold where the complex structure is restricted to be diagonal and symmetric by choosing fluxes which are\ninvariant under cyclic permutations of the three 2-tori. Thus, the complex structure\nparameters are proportional to the identity matrix, \u03c4ij = \u03c4 \u03b4ij . We will consider this\norientifold in two T-dual descriptions, namely as a IIB compactification with O3-planes\nand as a IIA compactification with O6-planes. This model has three complex moduli:\n\u03c4 , which is the complex structure parameter of the torus in IIB and the K\u00e4hler modulus\nin IIA; S, the axiodilaton; and U, which is the K\u00e4hler modulus in IIB and the complex\nstructure modulus in IIA.\nAllowing all generalized fluxes which are consistent with the symmetric restriction\nyields a polynomial superpotential for the four-dimensional theory:\nW = a0 \u2212 3a1 \u03c4 + 3a2 \u03c4 2 \u2212 a3 \u03c4 3\n\n(2.11)\n2\n\n3\n\n+S(\u2212b0 + 3b1 \u03c4 \u2212 3b2 \u03c4 + b3 \u03c4 )\n+3U(c0 + (2c1 \u2212 c\u03031 )\u03c4 \u2212 (2c2 \u2212 c\u03032 )\u03c4 2 \u2212 c3 \u03c4 3 )\n\u2261 P1 (\u03c4 ) + SP2 (\u03c4 ) + UP3 (\u03c4 ).\nThe integer coefficients ai , bi , ci correspond to the number of units of integrated fluxes\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fon cycles of the torus. 5 The ai come from R-R fluxes in both IIA and IIB. The bi in\nIIB come from H-flux on various cycles of the torus, while in IIA they are given by (in\nascending order) H, f, Q, R. The ci in IIB are all due to Q-flux, and in IIA are again\ngiven by (in ascending order) H, f, Q, R. For further details, we refer the reader to [9].\nIn our conventions, the tree-level K\u00e4hler potential is given by\nK = \u22123 ln(\u2212i(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 )) \u2212 ln(\u2212i(S \u2212 S\u0304)) \u2212 3 ln(\u2212i(U \u2212 \u016a )) .\n\n(2.12)\n\nEquations (2.11) and (2.12) determine the scalar potential, which has the usual form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\n(2.13)\nV = eK \uf8ed\nK ij Di W Dj W \u2212 3|W |2\uf8f8 .\ni,j\u2208{\u03c4,U,S}\n\nThe R-R tadpole constraints (2.3) applied to this model yield the restrictions on\nthe integer coefficients\na0 b3 \u2212 3a1 b2 + 3a2 b1 \u2212 a3 b0 = 16\n(2.14)\nand\na0 c3 + a1 (2c2 \u2212 c\u03032 ) \u2212 a2 (2c1 \u2212 c\u03031 ) \u2212 a3 c0 = 0.\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe nonvanishing right hand side of (2.14) is the contribution from the orientifold\nplanes. The NS-NS Bianchi identities and tadpoles, in this model, give a set of constraints relating the bi and the ci :\nc0 b2 \u2212 c\u03031 b1 + c1 b1 \u2212 c2 b0 = 0\n\n(2.16)\n\nc1 b3 \u2212 c2 b2 + c\u03032 b2 \u2212 c3 b1 = 0\n\n(2.17)\n\nc0 b3 \u2212 c\u03031 b2 + c1 b2 \u2212 c2 b1 = 0\n\n(2.18)\n\nc1 b2 \u2212 c2 b1 + c\u03032 b1 \u2212 c3 b0 = 0,\n\n(2.19)\n\nas well as a set of constraints among the ci :\nc0 c\u03032 \u2212 c21 + c\u03031 c1 \u2212 c2 c0 = 0\nc3 c\u03031 \u2212\n\nc22\n\n(2.20)\n\n+ c\u03032 c2 \u2212 c1 c3 = 0\n\n(2.21)\n\nc3 c0 \u2212 c2 c1 = 0.\n\n(2.22)\n\nOf the seven NS-NS constraints (2.16\u20132.22), four are independent. Including the R-R\nconstraints (2.14\u20132.15) then gives six independent constraints, reducing the number of\nindependent flux integers from fourteen to eight.\n5\n\nThe flux integer c1 is in the notation of [9] c1 \u2261 \u01091 = \u010d1 , and likewise for c2 . We will use the\nnotation ci to refer to all coefficients in P3 (\u03c4 ).\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fFinally, in order to avoid additional subtleties, we impose the further restriction\nthat all flux coefficients should be even. This restriction is motivated by the observation\nthat even numbers of flux quanta on an orientifolded manifold lift to integer quanta on\nthe original manifold, while odd numbers of flux quanta require a more sophisticated\nconstruction incorporating exotic orientifold planes [27]. For simplicity, we will thus\nconsider only even numbers of flux quanta for all of the generalized fluxes we consider\nhere. For any individual nongeometric NS-NS flux, this restriction to even integers\nonly can be understood as the T-dual description of requiring the number of units of\nH-flux to be even. While this argument from T-duality is insufficient to fully describe\na general combination of NS-NS generalized fluxes, where the new fluxes can never be\nT-dualized completely to H-flux, it is a strong motivation to consider only even flux\ncoefficients.\n\n3. Equations of Motion\nLet us now discuss solutions to the tree level equations of motion in the effective\ntheory defined by the superpotential (2.11) and the K\u00e4hler potential (2.12). The scalar\npotential comes entirely from F -terms, as in this model the remaining fields are not\ncharged under the gauge group, and there is therefore no D-term contribution. Thus,\nto find supersymmetric solutions, it suffices to solve the F -flat conditions D\u03b1 W =\n\u2202\u03b1 W + (\u2202\u03b1 K)W = 0.\nIn Subsection 3.1 we summarize the equations we are interested in solving. In 3.2\nwe describe some simple special cases of solutions. In 3.3 we discuss the criteria for\nvalidity of solutions.\n3.1 Equations\nThe equations of motion we are interested in solving are the F -flat conditions\nP1 (\u03c4 ) + S\u0304P2 (\u03c4 ) + UP3 (\u03c4 ) = 0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\nU + \u016a P3 (\u03c4 ) = 0\nP1 (\u03c4 ) + SP2 (\u03c4 ) +\n3\n3\n(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 )\u2202\u03c4 W \u2212 3W = 0 .\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\nUsing equations (3.1) and (3.2), one finds that physical solutions must satisfy\nIm (P2 P\u03043 ) = 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\nOne may readily solve for U and S as functions of \u03c4 , leaving (3.4) and a twelfth-order\n(real) polynomial equation for the real and imaginary parts of \u03c4 coming from (3.3).\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fThus, we must simultaneously solve this twelfth-order polynomial and a (real) fifthorder polynomial from (3.4), which in general must be done numerically. Once we have\na solution \u03c40 , S0 , U0 , we can read off the string coupling,\ng=\n\n1\n,\nIm S0\n\n(3.5)\n\nand the cosmological constant\n\u039b = V (\u03c40 , S0 , U0 ) = \u22123eK(\u03c40 ,S0 ,U0 ) |W (\u03c40 , S0 , U0 )|2 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nWe consider physical solutions to equations (3.1\u20133.3) to be only those with positive\nvalues for the imaginary parts of all moduli. In the absence of fluxes, this requirement\nis straightforward to interpret, as the imaginary parts of the moduli control the string\ncoupling and geometric information about the internal manifold, and must be strictly\ngreater than zero. We assume that this positivity requirement continues to hold in the\npresence of arbitrary combinations of generalized fluxes, as turning on fluxes simply\nturns on new couplings in the scalar sector of the four-dimensional theory.\nRelatedly, the real (axionic) parts of the moduli are in our conventions periodic\nwith unit period. This periodicity is easily derived in the underlying toroidal compactification in the language of either IIA or IIB. The addition of fluxes, conventional and\nnongeometric, again only adds couplings between the scalar fields and does not affect\nthe range in which they take values.\nOur interest here is to systematically study the solutions to the equations of motion\n(3.1\u20133.3) for general choices of the integer coefficients ai , bi , ci in (2.11). Not all choices\nof flux integers admit a physical supersymmetric solution. The choices of flux integers\nthat do yield physical solutions generically fix all moduli and are generically not gauge\nequivalent to any vacua which have a conventional geometric interpretation in either\ntype IIA or IIB. We will discuss two particularly well-behaved families of such vacua\nin Section 4, and describe the general solutions in Section 5.\nIn order to understand the solution space of this model, we must understand how\nto avoid multiply counting solutions which are related by the modular group of the\ncompactification. In our simple torus model, the non-compact portion of the modular\ngroup is given by the integral shift symmetries of the three axionic scalar fields. The\nshift \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + n combines with the inversion \u03c4 \u2192 \u22121/\u03c4 to give a factor of SL(2, Z).\nThe S-duality transformation S \u2192 \u22121/S, which would combine with the shifts S \u2192\nS + m to give another factor of SL(2, Z), maps generalized NS-NS fluxes to additional\nnongeometric structures which mix the metric with R-R fields [9, 28]. As S-duality\ntherefore takes us out of the class of compactifications we consider here, it is not a\nfactor in the modular group and we will not study it further here. The same is true\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fabout the inversion transformation U \u2192 \u22121/U. Each of these transformations of the\nmoduli is accompanied by a corresponding transformation of the fluxes to leave the\nequations of motion invariant. We give the explicit form of all of these transformations\nin appendix A. These transformations descend from large gauge transformations, and\ntherefore configurations related by these transformations are physically equivalent. In\naddition, there is a Z2 factor in the modular group which flips the signs of all fluxes,\ntaking W \u2192 \u2212W ; this transformation does not produce a physically distinct vacuum\nand as such is also a gauge transformation.\nIn addition to the modular group discussed above, there are a number of additional\ntransformations relating vacua which, despite having identical spectra, are physically\ninequivalent. First, there is a sign flip taking \u03c4, S, U \u2192 \u2212\u03c4\u0304 , \u2212S\u0304, \u2212\u016a , with an accompanying transformation on the fluxes leaving the equations of motion invariant.\nAdditionally, one may shift the axions by rational numbers, e.g. U \u2192 U + 1/n or\nS \u2192 S + 1/n, which is possible whenever the resulting fluxes are still even integers.\nBoth the sign flip and the fractional shift transformations relate vacua with physically\ndistinct expectation values for the axions but identical spectra of particle masses, coupling constant, and cosmological constant. Thus, we have relations between different\nfour-dimensional theories since the transformations act on the couplings as well as the\nfields. One can therefore think of theories related by these transformations as being\npart of a discrete moduli space of a larger theory.\n3.2 Some special cases\nThere are several classes of possible flux configurations which are of special interest:\nfluxes which have an interpretation as a geometric IIB compactification, fluxes which\nhave an interpretation as a geometric IIA compactification, and fluxes yielding solutions\nwhich have a vanishing expectation value for the superpotential, giving a Minkowski\nvacuum at tree level. Each of these subclasses of flux integers seems to be a set of measure zero with respect to the full set of possible flux configurations admitting physical\nsolutions. We will discuss these cases in this section, and treat more general cases in\nthe remainder of the paper.\n3.2.1 Geometric IIB vacua\nIf one takes all the ci to vanish, then the resulting compactification is simply a standard\nIIB flux compactification on the torus, and the superpotential (2.11) reduces to the\nwell-known Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential [2]. The resulting vacua on the torus\nhave been studied in [29, 30, 31]. As is well-known, these fluxes are not sufficient to\nstabilize all moduli at tree level. While in principle these configurations would appear\nas a subset of the compactifications we consider here, our main interest in this paper is\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fin vacua with all moduli stabilized, so we will not discuss geometric IIB vacua further\nhere. In particular, these vacua will not be included in the sets of vacua studied in\nSection 5.\n3.2.2 Geometric IIA vacua\nIf the fluxes b2 , b3 and c2 , c\u03032 , c3 all vanish, then all the remaining terms in the superpotential have a geometric interpretation in IIA; such toroidal compactifications with\ngeometric flux have been studied in [15, 32, 33, 34, 35]. On the symmetric torus,\nhowever, there is an additional interplay between the equations of motion and the constraints which drastically limits the kinds of supersymmetric vacua one may obtain in\nthis way.\nSince for a geometric solution in IIA, P2 and P3 are linear, equation (3.4) for \u03c4\nreduces to\n(Im \u03c4 )(3b1 c0 + b0 (2c1 \u2212 c\u03031 )) = 0.\n(3.7)\nRequiring Im \u03c4 > 0 then yields a constraint on the fluxes\n3b1 c0 + b0 (2c1 \u2212 c\u03031 ) = 0.\n\n(3.8)\n\nConsider, however, the tadpole constraints for this set of fluxes:\n3a2 b1 \u2212 a3 b0 = 16\n\n(3.9)\n\na2 (2c1 \u2212 c\u03031 ) + a3 c0 = 0\n\n(3.10)\n\n(c1 \u2212 c\u03031 )b1 = 0\n\n(3.11)\n\nc1 (c1 \u2212 c\u03031 ) = 0.\n\n(3.12)\n\nLet us suppose first that neither b1 nor (2c1 \u2212 c\u03031 ) is zero. Then using (3.8), we can\ntrade the ci in (3.10) for bi to find\n3a2 b1 \u2212 a3 b0 = 0,\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhich is, of course, inconsistent with (3.9).\nThe only way to avoid this inconsistency is to take either b1 or (2c1 \u2212 c\u03031 ) to be 0.\nThen the constraints enforce c1 = c\u03031 = c0 = 0, for both b1 = 0 and b1 6= 0. In either\ncase, this is simply an alternate description of a conventional IIB compactification.\nIf one chooses to cancel the tadpole from the orientifold planes using D-branes\ninstead of fluxes, then one may set the right hand side of (3.9) to zero. The constraints\nthen allow for a wider range of possible solutions, including those with no geometric\ninterpretation in IIB. We will limit our analysis here, however, to the tadpole as given\nin (3.9), without D-branes.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f3.2.3 Vacua with W = 0\nFrom the equations of motion, one may show that vacua where the superpotential\nvanishes at the minimum are obtained only when\nP1 (\u03c40 ) = P2 (\u03c40 ) = P3 (\u03c40 ) = 0,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere \u03c40 is the value of \u03c4 which solves the F -flat equations. It is then clear, as we need\nIm \u03c4 > 0, that a necessary condition for a W = 0 solution is that the polynomials Pi all\nshare a common quadratic factor, P , which vanishes at \u03c40 . The remaining nontrivial\nequations of motion then fix two of the four remaining degrees of freedom. While\nMinkowski vacua are very interesting, again, we are focusing our attention on vacua\nwith all moduli stabilized, and therefore will not examine W = 0 solutions further. For\na novel approach to this class of solutions, see [36].\n3.3 Validity of solutions\nWe are interested in supersymmetric solutions of the four-dimensional effective theory\ndefined by the superpotential (2.11) and the K\u00e4hler potential (2.12). In order for these\nsolutions to be at all trustworthy, we need to have a small value for the string coupling\ng, given through (3.5). Otherwise, nonperturbative string effects may radically change\nthe structure of the low-energy theory.\nThe next critical question in effective field theory calculations in a typical flux\ncompactification is whether the moduli are stabilized at masses light enough to render\nthe computation reliable when perturbative string effects are included \u2013 that is, whether\nthe effective field theory describes effects at energy scales which are controllably smaller\nthan the energy scales of higher Kaluza-Klein modes, winding modes, and excited string\nmodes. The analogous question for a compactification incorporating nongeometric\ntwists is more subtle as in the absence of a well-defined critical sigma model we do\nnot know precisely how to estimate the mass scales of the string modes (in general the\ndistinction between Kaluza-Klein and other inherently stringy modes such as winding\nmodes will break down). Given some such concrete stringy solution, we might hope in\nprinciple to find a rough estimate of the scale of the string modes to compare with the\nmasses of the modes retained in the four-dimensional effective theory.\nWe have found sets of supersymmetric solutions to the effective field theory which\nhave tunably small string coupling, cosmological constant, and masses for the moduli,\nas we will detail in the following section. These solutions have some very interesting\nproperties. As the string coupling can be made arbitrarily small, they are well in the\nperturbative regime. The mass scales computed in the effective theory can also be made\nparametrically small, although, again, we do not have a reliable method of computing\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fthe scale of the effective UV cutoff in our models for comparison. Here we take, as a\nzeroth-order estimate, the scale of heavier modes to be set by those scales which, in the\nabsence of flux, would set the masses of momentum and winding modes on the torus.\nThe mass scales in our families of solutions can indeed be made parametrically lighter\nthan this estimate for the cutoff. Our solutions do contain non-nilpotent algebras,\nhowever, (as do [33, 34]) and thus are in the class of vacua which seem most difficult\nto lift to ten dimensions. By analogy with the geometric cases discussed in [7], we\nmight be concerned that our na\u00efve method of estimating the cutoff scale, based on\nan underlying torus geometry, may be inaccurate, so that some of the moduli masses\nmay be comparable to the cutoff scale. In this case, our vacua would need to be\naugmented with other modes with comparable masses to the fields already included in\nthe effective four-dimensional theory in order to construct a full-blown string model. On\nthe other hand, the existence of supersymmetric vacua with parametrically controlled\nstring coupling, moduli masses, and cosmological constant suggests strongly that these\nvacua can be lifted in some way to string theory.\n\n4. Families of Nongeometric Vacua\nIn this section we discuss two particularly interesting infinite families of solutions to\nthe equations of motion presented in the previous section. These infinite families precisely saturate the tadpole (which as discussed in Section 2 is equal to 16) without the\ninclusion of additional D-brane sources.\nThe fluxes which lead to our interesting infinite families of solutions are all modular\nequivalent to fluxes having\nP2 (\u03c4 ) = b(\u03c4 \u2212 1)3\n(4.1)\nfor some integer b, i.e. all the bi are equal. This form for the bi imposes restrictive\nconstraints on the ci . If in addition c3 = 0, there are only two possible choices for the\nremaining ci which satisfy the constraints (2.16\u20132.22). These two options are, in the\nnotation (c0 , (c1 , c\u03031 ), (c2 , c\u03032 ), c3 ),\neither\n\n(2(n + m), (\u22122m, 2n), (0, 2m), 0)\n\nor (2(n + m), (0, 2m), (2n, 2n), 0).\n\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nEach of these choices for the ci leads to an interesting set of physical solutions, as we\nwill see. Given these choices for the bi and the ci , one must then choose ai which satisfy\nthe RR constraints (2.14\u20132.15). A particularly simple way to solve the RR constraints\nis to take a0 = 16/b, with the remaining ai = 0. Since a0 and b must be (even) integers,\nthe only possible choices for b are 2, 4, and 8. There are other choices one may make\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\ffor the ai ; we merely choose this one for simplicity and because we can exactly solve\nfor the moduli.\nThe first family of solutions we consider is (4.2), with the ai chosen as in the previous paragraph. Using the notation (a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 ), (b0 , b1 , b2 , b3 ), (c0 , (c1 , c\u03031 ), (c2 , c\u03032 ), c3 ),\nthe fluxes here are\n(16/b, 0, 0, 0), (b, b, b, b), (2(n + m), (\u22122m, 2n), (0, 2m), 0).\nThese fluxes yield physical solutions for the moduli\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0010 \u0011\nn+m\nn\n\u03c40 =\n\u00b1\ni,\nm\nm\nm3\nS0 = 2 3 (\u22128 \u00b1 2i) ,\nbn\nm\nU0 = 2 (4 \u00b1 2i).\nbn\n\n(4.4)\n\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nThe \u00b1 in the imaginary parts should be picked to make the imaginary parts positive,\ni.e. + when m/n > 0 and \u2212 when m/n < 0. The same sign must be picked in all three\nmoduli to ensure a solution to the equations of motion. This family of solutions has\nstring coupling\nb2 n3\n(4.8)\ng=\n2m3\nand cosmological constant\n\u039b=\u2212\n\n3b3 n6\n.\n16m3\n\n(4.9)\n\nThis family is thus easy to tune to small string coupling and cosmological constant by\nfixing n and taking m to be large. Notice that it is impossible to tune both g and \u039b\nto be finite; there must be an accumulation point for one or both quantities at either\nzero or infinity in any infinite set.\nMeanwhile, the fields \u03c4, S, U have a mass matrix given by\n\uf8eb 21b3 n4\n\uf8f6\n3b5 n8\n\u22123b4 n7\n\u00b1 16m\n0\n0\n0\n32m5\n32m3\n3 n4\n\u22123b5 n8\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\u00b1 33b\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n16m\n16m5\n7\n12\n6\n11\n5\n8\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nb n\n3b n\n\u22123b n\n\u00b1\n0\n\u00b1\n0\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\n5\n9\n7\n16m\n32m\n64m\nMij = \uf8ec 3b5 n8\n(4.10)\nb7 n12\n3b6 n11 \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ec 32m5\n0\n0\n\u00b1 32m9\n0\n\u00b1 32m7 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n5 n10\n6 n11\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n\u00b1 3b32m\n0 \uf8f8\n0\n\u00b1 3b64m\n7\n5\n6 n11\n5 n10\n\u22123b4 n7\n0\n0\n\u00b1 3b32m\n0\n\u00b1 3b16m\n7\n5\n32m3\nin the basis {Re \u03c4, Im \u03c4, Re S, Im S, Re U, Im U}. The choices of sign \u00b1 in the matrix\nelements are determined by the choices of sign in the moduli, (4.5\u20134.7). The eigenvalues\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fof Mij come in pairs, scaling as m\u22121 , m\u22125 , and m\u22129 in the controllable limit where\nm \u2192 \u221e with n fixed. Thus all the fields in this family of solutions have parametrically\nlight masses. Our zeroth-order estimate for the cutoff scale, by contrast, scales as m0 .\nThe second two-parameter family, with the ci as given in (4.3), is similar to the\none above. The fluxes are\n(16/b, 0, 0, 0), (b, b, b, b), (2(n + m), (0, 2n), (2m, 2m), 0),\nand it is easy to check that the moduli\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nn+m\nn + 2m\n\u03c40 = \u2212\n\u00b1\ni,\nm\nm\n\u00133\n\u0012\nm\n1\n(8 \u00b1 2i) ,\nS0 = 2\nb 2m + n\nm\n(\u22124 \u00b1 2i)\nU0 =\nb(2m + n)2\n\n(4.11)\n\n(4.12)\n(4.13)\n(4.14)\n\nsolve the F -flat equations. As above, the \u00b1 in the imaginary parts of these moduli\nshould be picked to keep the imaginary parts positive; the plus sign should be used\nwhen m > 0, n > \u22122m and the minus sign should be used when m < 0, n > \u22122m.\nAgain, the same sign must be picked in all three moduli to give a solution to the\nequations of motion. These values for the moduli give string coupling\ng=\n\nb2 (2m + n)3\n2m3\n\n(4.15)\n\nand cosmological constant\n3b3 (2m + n)6\n.\n\u039b=\u2212\n16m3\n\n(4.16)\n\nThe masses for the moduli in these vacua are again parametrically light. These two\nfamilies have identical spectra but are not equivalent under modular transformations.\nThere are more general choices one can make for the ai than in the two families\ndiscussed explicitly above. For example, any modular transformation S \u2192 S + q or\nU \u2192 U + q will take the fluxes of (4.4), (4.11) to flux sets with more ai nonzero.\nIt is particularly interesting to consider the effect of fractional shifts of the form\nU \u2192 U + (1/q), on these families. These shifts are permissible whenever ci /q is an\neven integer for all ci . Every time we can perform such a shift, we get a physically\ninequivalent theory with identical spectrum. Each fractional shift yields another infinite\nfamily of vacua, with different values for the flux parameters ai and for the expectation\nvalue of Re U. Clearly, the number of such shifts we can perform is controlled by the\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\ffactors of the ci fluxes. But because the ci appear only homogenously in the constraint\nequations, we are free to scale them up to arbitrarily large values. As we scale up m\nand n, we will encounter numbers that have an increasingly large number of factors,\nand be able to perform more such shifts. Thus, as m and n increase, the degeneracy of\nthese vacua increases, becoming infinite in the m, n \u2192 \u221e limit. Degeneracies due to\nfractional shifts of the axions are in fact a general, though little-remarked, feature of\nflux compactifications; the novelty in the present case is that the tadpole cancellation\nconditions fail to prevent arbitrarily large degeneracies.\nIn this section we have derived infinite families of solutions to the four-dimensional\nfield theory associated with general fluxes. As we have discussed, it is not clear that\nwe can take even those solutions with small g at face value as solutions of a complete\nstring theory compactification. It is furthermore entirely possible that even if these\nsolutions are valid for small fluxes, they may break down in the limit of infinite flux.\nAlthough the average energy density in the internal space due to the fluxes, given by\nthe cosmological constant, can remain small, as the fluxes become infinite one might\nexpect that there are regions where the local energy density becomes large enough to\nnecessitate an accurate treatment of back reaction.\n\n5. Statistics of Generic Vacua\nSo far we have described some special classes of solutions to the equations of motion\n(3.1, 3.2, 3.3). To investigate the properties of general solutions, we proceed numerically. Numerical computation of solutions for flux vacuum equations of this type\nrequires three ingredients. First, we must generate a set of (even) fluxes satisfying the\nconstraint equations (2.14-2.22). Second, we must numerically solve the equations (3.1,\n3.2, 3.3) for the moduli \u03c4, S, U. Finally, we must impose a gauge-fixing of the modular\nsymmetries (A.1\u2013A.6) so that we do not count the same \"vacuum\" twice.\nIn previous analogous work on the statistics of IIB flux compactifications [29, 37, 38]\nonly a finite number of solutions were compatible with a fixed tadpole bound L. Thus,\nL acted as a natural cutoff, and it was natural to investigate the growth of the number\nof solutions as a function of L. In the case we are investigating here, as we have seen in\nthe previous section, there are infinite families of solutions even at fixed tadpole L = 16.\nTo proceed numerically we must impose an artificial cutoff on the set of allowed fluxes.\nWe then need to compute quantities which approach well-defined limits as the cutoff\nis taken to infinity.\nGenerating fluxes satisfying the constraints is straightforward. Fixing an upper\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fbound N for the fluxes, so that\n|ai |, |bi |, |ci | \u2264 N ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwe can scan through an independent subset of the fluxes and solve for the remaining\ndependent fluxes using some of the constraints in time polynomial in N. In general, any\nparticular algebraic solution to the constraint equations is only valid if certain quantities\nare nonvanishing. For example, solving (2.14) for a0 is only possible if b3 6= 0. We have\ngenerated fluxes using several different subsets of the equations, and have confirmed\nthat the fluxes missed in this process comprise an increasingly small fraction of the set\nof allowed fluxes as N is increased.\nNumerically solving the equations (3.1-3.3) is also straightforward in principle.\nAgain, however, any specific approach to solving the equations assumes certain quantities to be nonvanishing. We have carried out a systematic search for solutions to\nthe F -flat equations which stabilize all moduli at tree level for fluxes within the region\n(5.1). The stabilization of all moduli is generic, although as we have mentioned in\nSection 3.2 there are some cases of special interest which do not fall into this category.\nAs discussed in, for example, [29, 38], there are two ways of imposing gauge-fixing.\nOn the one hand, we can generate all possible fluxes satisfying the constraints (up to\nour cutoff), numerically solve the vacuum equations for all fluxes, and then select only\nthose solutions which live in a fixed modular region in \u03c4, S, U space. On the other hand,\nwe can perform the gauge-fixing at the level of the fluxes, choosing only fluxes which\nsatisfy a particular gauge-fixing condition. In general, if we can gauge-fix at the level of\nthe fluxes, such that we can efficiently generate only fluxes in the given modular region,\nour search will be much more efficient, since otherwise most of our computer time is\nspent scanning regions outside the modular domain; this problem becomes worse as\nthe scale of the fluxes increases and more copies of the modular domain are probed.\nThe challenge in gauge-fixing at the level of the fluxes is that there is not always a\nsimple gauge-fixing choice for the fluxes. In the problem we are interested in here, it is\neasy to fix the modular transformations S \u2192 S +n, U \u2192 U +m by imposing conditions\non the fluxes. It is less straightforward, however, to fix the SL(2, Z) symmetry on\n\u03c4 at the level of the fluxes. We have used the following approach to gauge-fix this\nsymmetry: when P2 (\u03c4 ) has a pair of complex roots, we can use it to determine a\nreference value \u03c4r which is the root of P2 in the upper-half complex plane. We then\ngauge-fix the SL(2, Z) symmetry by requiring \u03c4r to be in the standard fundamental\ndomain F = {\u03c4 : |\u03c4 | \u2265 1, \u22121/2 < Re \u03c4 \u2264 1/2, |\u03c4 | = 1 \u21d2 Re \u03c4 \u2265 0}. When P2 (\u03c4 ) has\nall real roots, but P3 (\u03c4 ) has a pair of complex roots, we choose \u03c4r to be the complex\nroot of P3 with positive imaginary part. We then again fix the SL(2, Z) symmetry\nby taking \u03c4r \u2208 F . The complexity of the roots of a cubic polynomial depends on a\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fdiscriminant inequality on the coefficients, much as for a quadratic polynomial. Thus,\nthe subset of fluxes which cannot be gauge-fixed in this way represents a fraction of\norder 1 of the full set of fluxes.\nWe have generated sets of fluxes up to N = 30 which satisfy the following explicit\nmodular and sign fixing conditions\n\u2022 \u03c4r \u2208 F\n\u2022 c3 \u2265 0, if c3 = 0 then b3 \u2265 0\n\u2022 b0 \u2265 0, if b0 = 0 then c0 \u2265 0\n\u2022 (a0 , a3 ) = \u03b1(b0 , b3 ) + 3\u03b2(c0 , c3 ), where 0 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 < 1\nRestricting to these fluxes completely fixes the modular freedom, though again some\nsets of measure zero are lost. Here we are fixing two choices of sign, both the choice of\noverall sign for the fluxes, which relates two different descriptions of the same vacuum,\nas well as the global transformation (A.7), which relates two inequivalent but degenerate\nvacua. Therefore for each solution we find, there is an additional solution related by\nthe transformation (A.7). We find that the number of gauge-fixed fluxes in the region\n(5.1) scales roughly as N 4 .\nWe have explicitly solved the equations of motion (3.1-3.3) for this set of gaugefixed fluxes. We find that roughly 20% of all fluxes yield physical supersymmetric\nsolutions. This fraction did not change significantly as N increased. A plot of the\ndistribution of string couplings g and cosmological constants \u039b is shown in Figure 1,\nfor the data up to N = 20. As can be seen from the figure, large string coupling is\ncorrelated with large \u039b. This is not surprising, since g = 1/Im S0 appears as a factor\nof eK . In addition one may see from studying the equations of motion that g does not\nscale with P3 , while \u039b scales as P33, so that rescaling the ci increases the cosmological\nconstant and correspondingly decreases U without affecting g. This demonstrates that\nthe distribution shown in Figure 1 will have a tail reaching up to \u2212\u039b \u2192 \u221e at fixed g\nas N \u2192 \u221e.\nWhat is perhaps even more interesting is that the overall shape of the distribution\nshown in Figure 1 does not change appreciably as N increases. As far as we can\ntell from our sample, the distribution of vacua in g-\u039b space is independent of the\nscale N of the fluxes. This implies in particular that unless there is some dramatic\nqualitative change at much larger N, there are an infinite number of solutions of the\nF -flat equations in fixed finite regions of g-\u039b parameter space. Moreover, the vacuum\nexpectation values for the non-compact scalar fields Im \u03c4 and Im U also accumulate\naccording to a distribution whose shape is apparently independent of N. This leads\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\f30\nN <= 20\n\n25\n\nln(-Lambda)\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nln(g)\n\nFigure 1: Log-log plot of g, \u039b for gauge-fixed fluxes up to N = 20\n\nto an infinite accumulation of solutions in fixed finite regions of parameter space. In\nFigures 2 and 3 we select one bounded region in g-\u039b space and show how the number of\nsolutions within given ranges of Im \u03c4 and Im U increases with the maximum flux N. The\nregion in g-\u039b space we have chosen to illustrate in the figures is 10 < ln (\u2212\u039b) < 15,\n1 < ln g < 8. In Figure 2 we show the distribution of Im U for solutions which lie\nwithin this bounded region in g-\u039b space. In Figure 3, we show the distribution of\nIm \u03c4 for the same set of solutions. The data have been binned into ranges of useful\nsize for both variables. The gradations of color/grayscale in the graphs show how the\nsolutions accumulate as a function of maximum flux size N; we have plotted the data for\nN = 8, 12, 16, and 20, with a separate color/shade for each successive value of N. As is\nevident in both figures, the distribution of vacua appears to be fairly independent of the\nscale N of the fluxes, and exhibits no strong indication of running to the boundaries\nof moduli space. While these \"vacua\" are completely untrustworthy, lying at large\nstring coupling, this illustrates that for this model there seem to be an infinite number\nof distinct tree-level SUSY solutions for a family of gauged supergravity theories in\na finite volume of moduli space. This is the only example we know of where even\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fNumber of Solutions\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\nBins of 1\u0090Im U\nH0,25L\n\nH25,50L\n\nH50,75L H75,100L H100,125LH125,150LH150,175LH175,200LH200,225L\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of values of 1/Im U as a function of maximum flux N for solutions within a\nparticular range of g and \u039b. Successive shaded regions correspond to N = 8, 12, 16, 20 respectively.\n\nin the tree-level low-energy approximation there is such an infinite family of vacua.\nIf these vacua correspond to good vacua for a full nonperturbative string theory, it\nwould seem to contradict the expectation of [23] that there are only a finite number\nof vacua compatible with any finite region of physical parameter space. It would be\ninteresting to study these solutions further to ascertain whether they have a specific\nphysical nonperturbative instability. Another interesting feature of the distribution of\nsolutions shown in Figure 1 is that it does not contain any solutions with small g, \u039b.\nThis stands in contrast to the cases where both P2 (\u03c4 ) and P3 (\u03c4 ) have three real roots,\nas we now discuss.\nAlthough the above gauge-fixing procedure breaks down in the case where all roots\nof P2 (\u03c4 ) and P3 (\u03c4 ) are real, we have generated a representative sample of fluxes in this\ncategory up to N = 20 and numerically solved the equations of motion. It is then\npossible to remove the modular redundancy by choosing the solution for \u03c4 to lie within\nF , and then imposing the other gauge-fixing conditions. The resulting distribution\nof solutions is shown in Figure 4. This distribution has the same broad features as\nthat shown in Figure 1. In particular, we still see evidence for an infinite number of\ndistinct solutions in finite regions of g-\u039b-space.

Indeed, many of the points in Figure 4 are members of the controllable\nfamilies discussed in the previous section. It would be nice to have a clearer quantitative\nunderstanding of why small values of g and \u039b seem so much more difficult to realize in\nthe case where P2 (\u03c4 ), P3 (\u03c4 ) have complex roots.\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe main goal of this paper has been to investigate supersymmetric vacua of the\nN = 1 effective theory developed in [9]. We find that generic supersymmetric solutions\nhave the following properties: all moduli are stabilized at tree level; the solutions are\nnot gauge-equivalent to geometric compactifications in any duality frame; the string\ncoupling and four-dimensional cosmological constant are not particularly small; and\nthere appear to be an infinite number of solutions in finite regions of parameter space\nwithout vanishing or infinite limits. In addition, we have found infinite families of vacua\nwhich have parametrically controllable string coupling and mass scales.\nThe apparently infinite number of solutions in bounded regions of parameter space\nis perhaps a bit surprising, and seems to conflict with the intuition underlying recent\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\f30\nN <= 20\n25\n\n20\n\nln(-Lambda)\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nln(g)\n\nFigure 4: Log-log plot of g, \u039b for fluxes where P2 , P3 have real roots up to N = 20\n\nspeculations regarding finiteness of the landscape of string vacua [23, 39]. Indeed, if\nthere are an infinite number of valid string vacua in a finite range of parameter space in\neffective field theory, with sufficiently small (or negative) cosmological constants, it is\ndifficult to avoid an infinite transition rate into those vacua via vacuum decay processes\n(though not impossible, if for example increasing a parameter such as a flux sufficiently\nquickly increases the height or width of the potential barrier separating these vacua\nfrom the physical vacuum). It is therefore worthwhile to discuss a number of possible\nreasons why the solutions we have found here may not represent true supersymmetric\nstring vacua.\nTo begin with, as we have discussed, it is quite possible that the four-dimensional\neffective field theories studied here simply cannot be lifted to a full string background,\neven with the inclusion of other modes with masses comparable to those of the moduli.\nEven if these field theories can be lifted to geometric or nongeometric backgrounds,\ngiven the difficulty of achieving modular invariance in nongeometric asymmetric orbifold constructions [20, 40] it is conceivable that the class of generalized flux compactifications we consider here must obey unexpected constraints at the one-loop level which\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fwould eliminate many or all of the tree-level solutions given here. It is also possible that\nwe have missed a tree-level constraint on the allowed fluxes, although it is somewhat\ndifficult to see how further constraints might arise. Actually constructing string backgrounds which incorporate nongeometric fluxes is probably the most promising way of\nanalyzing this set of possibilities further, and we leave this as an open problem.\nAnother possibility is that we have misidentified the modular redundancy of the\ntheory, and that many of the distinct solutions which we find should in fact be considered to be equivalent descriptions of the same solution. We can conceptually separate\ntwo different ways in which the number of vacua becomes large: first, the fractional\naxionic shifts which give potentially large numbers of degenerate vacua with identical\ng and \u039b, and second, the increasing density of distinct values of g and \u039b within a\nfinite region as the maximum flux N is increased. There are no known symmetries\nwhich would identify these vacua, and our numerical work shows no evidence of extra\nredundancies associated with unknown modular equivalences which would reduce the\nnumber of inequivalent vacua to a finite number. It is conceivable, however, that such a\nsymmetry exists, which would reduce the number of physically inequivalent solutions.\nYet another possibility is the destabilization of the tree-level solutions by the inclusion of either \u03b1\u2032 effects or neglected momentum or winding modes. If our solutions do\nlift to full string backgrounds, we expect in general that \u03b1\u2032 effects will be significant. In\nconventional flux compactifications, one can often work in a large volume limit, where\n\u03b1\u2032 corrections are highly suppressed; we are unable to do that here. Indeed, in simple\nexamples nongeometric fluxes typically stabilize length scales of the compactification\nmanifold at the string scale by relating radii to their duals under monodromy, so we expect \u03b1\u2032 corrections to generically be important. Finally, it is possible that we should not\nallow the NS-NS fluxes to become arbitrarily large, as such a flux configuration might\nlead to large local backreaction, as we have discussed briefly at the end of Section 4.\nDespite all these possible problems in extending the solutions we have found to\nfull-fledged string theory solutions, the generalized fluxes appearing in the superpotential seem to capture essentially topological features of the string compactification, and\nit seems to us likely that the vacua found here do capture the main features of a new\nclass of string compactifications. Even if these four-dimensional effective theories do\nnot include all the physics of the full string theory, they may point the way to a new and\ninteresting class of constructions of string vacua. Certainly, the question of which fourdimensional effective supergravity theories can be lifted to complete string theories is a\nvery important one which deserves more attention at this time. Whether this question\nis best resolved by a top-down (landscape [41]) approach of attempting to characterize the most general structure of string theory compactifications, or by a bottom-up\n(swampland [24, 42]) approach of understanding which four-dimensional theories have\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fa good UV completion remains to be seen. In any case, a full characterization of the\nspace of string vacua which might be compared productively with experiment requires\na resolution of this question. It is our hope that the solutions and caveats which we\nhave developed here may provide a useful set of test cases to better understand the\nboundaries of the landscape.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Michael Douglas, Henriette Elvang, Mariana Gra\u00f1a, Nick\nHalmagyi, Albion Lawrence, Jan Louis, Shamit Kachru, David Marks, Ilarion Melnikov,\nRuben Minasian, Greg Moore, Sav Sethi, Alessandro Tomasiello, Cumrun Vafa, and\nBrook Williams for helpful conversations.

The transformation laws for the ai , bi are, as usual,\na0 \u2192 a0 + 3a1 n + 3a2 n2 + a3 n3\na1 \u2192 a1 + 2na2 + n2 a3\n\n(A.3)\n\na2 \u2192 a2 + na3\na3 \u2192 a3 ,\nwhile the transformations of the ci are slightly more involved:\nc0 \u2192 c0 \u2212 2nc1 + nc\u03031 \u2212 2n2 c2 + n2 c\u03032 + n3 c3\nc1 \u2192 c1 \u2212 nc\u03032 + nc2 \u2212 n2 c3\nc\u03031 \u2192 c\u03031 \u2212 2nc2 + n2 c3\n\n(A.4)\n\nc2 \u2192 c2 \u2212 nc3\nc\u03032 \u2192 c\u03032 + nc3\nc3 \u2192 c3 .\nThe separate transformations of c1 and c\u03031 can be deduced most easily from IIB, where\nthe shift \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + n is a large diffeomorphism and the ci are all given by Qab\nc on different\ncycles. By taking Q to transform as a mixed tensor under diffeomorphisms one may\nobtain the transformation rules above for the integrated fluxes.\nThere is also an inversion symmetry \u03c4 \u2192 \u22121/\u03c4 , under which\na0 \u2192 a3\na1 \u2192 \u2212a2\n\n(A.5)\n\na2 \u2192 a1\na3 \u2192 \u2212a0\nand similarly for the bi ; meanwhile,\nc0 \u2192 c3\nc1 \u2192 \u2212c2\n\n(A.6)\n\nc2 \u2192 c1\nc3 \u2192 \u2212c0 .\nUnder this transformation W \u2192 \u2212(1/\u03c4 3 )W , which combined with the change in the\nK\u00e4hler potential (2.12) leaves the scalar potential invariant.\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fThe last factor in the modular group, as described in Section 3, is a Z2 transformation which flips the signs of all fluxes, leaving the moduli invariant.\nOne may check that all the constraints are preserved under the above modular\ntransformations.\nIn Section 5 we fix in addition the global transformation which takes \u03c4, S, U \u2192\n\u2212\u03c4\u0304 , \u2212S\u0304, \u2212\u016a . Under this transformation the fluxes which multiply odd powers of the\nmoduli in the superpotential switch signs,\na1 , a3 , b0 , b2 , c0 , c2 , c\u03032 \u2192 \u2212a1 , \u2212a3 , \u2212b0 , \u2212b2 , \u2212c0 , \u2212c2 , \u2212c\u03032\n\n(A.7)\n\nso that W \u2192 W\u0304 .\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
