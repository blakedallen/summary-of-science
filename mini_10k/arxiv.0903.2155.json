Introduction\nA number of stellar model libraries have been developed to serve as databases for applications in various\nfields of astrophysics. These range from fitting evolutionary tracks to individual stars, to isochrone matching\nfor stellar clusters, up to complete population syntheses of galaxies. The latter purpose is probably the most\nfrequent one. Examples for such libraries are those at Padova (Girardi et al. 2000, and references therein),\nBaSTI at Teramo (Pietrinferni et al. 2004), and most recently the one at Dartmouth College (Dotter et al.\n2008). These libraries are constantly updated by new calculations and extended by covering more and more\nchemical compositions.\nIn terms of the evolutionary phases covered, all of the just cited libraries provide the results of full stellar models of low and intermediate mass (1 . M/M\u2299 . 8) up to the onset of thermal pulses (TP) on the\nAsymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). One reason is the prohibitive effort to follow the TP-AGB phase with complete models, not to speak of the notorious numerical problems encountered during this phase of strongly\nchanging timescales that can be as short as hours during a helium shell flashing. Another reason not to include full models in the libraries is the uncertainty of AGB calculations, owing to the importance of rather\nill-known physical effects, such as overshooting, rotation, and mass loss (see Herwig 2005 for a review of the\ncurrent state of the art problems).\nHowever, for populations with an age of a few hundred million to about 2 billion years, the contribution\nof intermediate mass stars cannot be ignored. Because of their high luminosity they contribute significantly\nto the integrated light, and due to their low surface temperatures they dominate the spectra and colours in\nthe near infrared. Liu et al. (2000), Raimondo et al. (2005) and others have demonstrated this effect convincingly. The Padova and BaSTI stellar model libraries have included the TP-AGB recently (Marigo & Girardi\n2007; Cordier et al. 2007) by making use of synthetic AGB-models (for a selection of historical and modern synthetic AGB-models see Iben & Truran 1978; Renzini & Voli 1981; Groenewegen & de Jong 1993;\nMarigo et al. 1996). Synthetic AGB-models try to predict basic stellar parameters, such as L(t), T eff (t) and\nstellar yields without resorting to calculations of full computations, but use relationships obtained from full\ncalculations. However, they are by no means merely reproducing the full models. Rather, they are using basic\nproperties, such as the mass of the helium core or the luminosity of the helium shell as function of time as\ninput for calculations of mass loss, effective temperature, envelope composition and even nucleosynthesis at\nthe bottom of the convective envelope (the Hot Bottom Burning; HBB). The idea is to take the complicated\ncore and helium shell evolution from full models and add the evolution of the hydrogen layers, which is less\ndifficult to compute by on-line calculations. With this approach the synthetic models can treat effects like\nthe third-dredge up or mass loss as an additional, free-to-chose property, which is then usually calibrated by\ncomparison of the synthetic models with observed AGB-star samples.\nTo some extent all synthetic models depend on results from full stellar modelling, and therefore extensive\ncomputations of the evolution along the AGB are needed. The most widely used AGB- and post-AGB tracks\nare those by Vassiliadis & Wood (1993, 1994) and Bloecker (1995b,a). The former calculations were done for\ninitial masses between 0.89 and 5 M\u2299 , and for chemical compositions of Z = 0.016 (\"solar\"), 0.008 (\"LMC\"),\n0.004 (\"SMC\"), and 0.001 (\"Pop. II\"). However, not all the mass values were calculated for each metallicity.\nThe most metal-poor set consists of only the 1.0 and 1.5 M\u2299 model. Bl\u00f6cker calculated models for only a\nPop. I metallicity, Z = 0.021 (1 \u2264 M/M\u2299 < 7). Wagenhuber & Groenewegen (1998) have provided fitting\nfunctions for synthetic populations based on the set of AGB calculations by Wagenhuber (1996) for three\nmetallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.008, and 0.001) and masses from 1 to 7 M\u2299 . Most recently, a new comprehensive\nset has been added by Karakas (2003) for 1 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 6 and Z = 0.004, 0.008, and 0.02, although the\nintention of this work has been to follow the nucleosynthesis in AGB stars, and not to provide a grid of AGB\nmodels for general usage. Obviously, the emphasis in all work quoted has been to provide models adequate\nfor solar-type stars and for the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, from which we have the largest amount\nof information about this evolutionary phase. For use in population synthesis models of galaxies, this range\nof model compositions is certainly not sufficient.\nMany of the physical ingredients for the models have been improved, in part considerably, since the\ngeneration of all these grids of AGB and post-AGB models. Most importantly, the available models were\ncalculated using opacities and equation of state prior than those by the OPAL group (Iglesias & Rogers 1996;\nRogers et al. 1996) or by the Opacity Project (Seaton 2007), which rests on the \"MHD\" equation of state\n(Mihalas et al. 1988). Only in Karakas (2003) high-temperature OPAL opacities were used. Similarly, the\nnuclear reactions and neutrino emission rates for most grids are from the '80s or are even older in some cases.\nIt is therefore timely to provide new grids for AGB stars, which include both the latest physical ingredients,\nand for a larger variety of chemical compositions. Sect. 2 presents the general structure of the stellar evolution\nprogram used. In Sect. 3 the details of the code specific to this project, which constitute the improvement over\n\n\fA.

Apart from the aspect of updated constitutional\nphysics and more extensive chemical compositions our emphasis lies on a consistent treatment of carbon\nenrichment of the envelope due to the third dredge-up. This includes the influence on the opacities, which\nhas been shown by Marigo (2002) to be crucial for the stars' temperature. This, in turn, is the most important\nparameter for dust-driven mass loss, which dominates the late AGB evolution and the transition to the postAGB. In Sect. 4 the results of our calculations will be presented. Conclusions will close the paper in Sect. 5.\n\n2. Program and calculation set-up\n\n2.1. Chemical composition and stellar mass grid\nIn addition to the previously mentioned chemical compositions representative for galactic Population I (\"solar\"), the LMC and SMC stars, we have added one super-solar composition with Z = 0.04 and one metal-poor\nwith Z = 0.0005. For the helium content of each mixture we used\nY = Yp + Z \u00d7\n\n\u2206Y\n,\n\u2206Z\n\n(1)\n\nwith Yp = 0.245 for the primordial helium content and \u2206Y/\u2206Z = 2.0 for the connection between helium\nand metal production. The first value is in agreement with the cosmological model and was also used, for\nexample, by Cordier et al. (2007), the second one is within the general range of determination. In addition, for\nthe first time \u03b1-element enhancement was taken into consideration in an AGB model grid, since the ratio of\nelements of the \u03b1-group relative to those of the iron-peak depends on the star formation history, which might\ndiffer radically from that of the galactic disk and halo. Examples are the galactic bulge and elliptical galaxies,\nwhere solar- and super-solar iron abundances along with \u03b1-enhancement are found. For each metallicity listed\nabove, both a solar-scaled and an \u03b1-enhanced metal mixture was used. In Tables 1 and 2 we list ten mixtures\nfor which we are providing models and the element distributions within the \"metals\". The solar mixture is\nthat of Seaton et al. (1992), which is almost identical to that of Grevesse & Noels (1993); the \u03b1-enhancement\nis simply taken as an additional +0.4 dex for all respective elements. These metal mixtures are identical to\nthose in Coelho et al. (2007).\nFor all 10 chemical compositions 11 initial mass values between 1 and 6 M\u2299 were calculated. They are 1.0,\n1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.6, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 M\u2299 . Calculations were started on the zero-age main-sequence\n(ZAMS) and continued as far as possible with the aim of reaching the white dwarf cooling track.\n\n2.2. Stellar evolution program: basic properties\nFor all calculations the Garching Stellar Evolution Code (GARSTEC) as described most recently in\nWeiss & Schlattl (2008) was used. Changes specifically applied for the present calculations will be discussed\nin the following section. The program is able to produce an up-to-date standard solar model (Weiss & Schlattl\n2008), from which a mixing length parameter of \u03b1MLT = 1.74 is obtained. For the calculations presented\nhere a value of 1.75 was used. The slight difference stems from the use of the solar metal distribution of\nGrevesse & Sauval (1998) in Weiss & Schlattl (2008).\nGARSTEC is able to follow low-mass stars through the core helium flash (e.g. Meissner & Weiss 2006)\nand many thermal pulses on the AGB without human intervention since the numerical improvements by\nWagenhuber & Weiss (1994). Nevertheless, towards the end of the TP-AGB phase convergence problems\nstill exist and inhibit a continuous modeling of the whole stellar evolution. We will return to this problem in\nSect. 4.2.1.\nAlthough particle diffusion is implemented in the program, and used in the solar model calibration, the\npresent calculations were done without employing it. However, a diffusive scheme is used for convective\nmixing. Mixing and nuclear burning are solved simultaneously in one set of equations, which is of particular\n\n\f4\n\nA. Weiss and J.W.

If needed, both burning\nphases can be solved together. The reaction rates are mainly from Caughlan et al. (1985) and Adelberger et al.\n(1998), with the following updates: We use the 3\u03b1-rate by Fynbo et al. (2005), the rate for the CNO bottleneck reaction 14 N(p, \u03b3)16 O by Formicola et al. (2004), and the 12 C(\u03b1, \u03b3)16 O-rate by Kunz et al. (2002). The\ninfluence of the former two updates was discussed already in Weiss et al. (2005). A deficit of this restricted\nnuclear reaction network is that the hotter proton-cycles as well as \u03b1-captures on intermediate elements such\nas nitrogen and oxygen are missing. Therefore the abundance of nitrogen during the TP-AGB phase is always\ntaken to be an upper limit, because part of it could be processed into heavier elements by such reactions.\nThe equation of state is the FreeEOS1 of A. Irwin (see Cassisi et al. 2003). We use Eddington grey atmospheres. All further details about our stellar evolution code can be found in Weiss & Schlattl (2008).\n\n3. Code improvements for AGB modeling\nThe evolution along the AGB is characterized by the internal nuclear processes, leading to increasing luminosities and larger stellar radii, and by the strong mass loss due to stellar winds, which depend on mass, radius,\nluminosity, and chemical composition of the envelope. As is known from the initial-mass to final-mass relation (see Weidemann 2000, for a comprehensive overview and Sect. 4.2.4), the wide range of initial masses\n(1 . M/M\u2299 . 8) results \u2013 due to the overwhelming effect of strong mass loss at higher AGB-luminosities \u2013 in\nquite a narrow range of white dwarf masses (0.5 . M/M\u2299 . 1.1). The mass loss itself depends on the chemical composition of the atmosphere and envelope, which itself is modified by internal nuclear processes and\nmixing between the convective envelope and regions of nuclear burning. Notably the third dredge-up, which\nleads to the enrichment of the envelope with carbon from the helium-burning layers, and which is the result of\nstructure changes in the course of the thermal pulses of the helium shell, is ultimately linked to the mass loss.\nThe enrichment of carbon in the outer stellar layers allows the formation of carbon-molecules and dust, which\nthen leads to dust-driven winds. Dust formation and wind depend strongly on stellar temperatures, which itself\nis determined by the superadiabatic convection of the envelope. The effectiveness of this convection depends\nupon the radiative transport and opacites which in turn are a function of the carbon abundance. It is the aim\nof our calculations to treat the carbon abundance variations of the stellar envelope and the consequences of\nit as consistently as possible. This implies a detailed treatment of nuclear processes, mixing, opacities, and\n1\n\navailable at http://freeeos.sourceforge.net\n\n\fA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\n5\n\nmass loss. In the following we will present how we approach this problem. The nuclear processes (carbon\nproduction during helium burning, CNO equilibrium) were previously discused in the preceeding section.\n\n3.1. Dredge-up by convective overshooting\nIn AGB-calculations with GARSTEC, as with most other programs, the third dredge-up does not occur with\nthe canonical physics described so far. If the third dredge-up occurs in our models it would show only for\nhigher masses at high AGB-luminosities (core masses) and low metallicity (Wagenhuber 1996). This is in\ncontradiction to observations and therefore additional mixing mechanisms are needed to ensure the appearance of carbon stars on the lower AGB for all populations. Several such processes have been invoked, such\nas gravity waves (Denissenkov & Tout 2003), rotationally induced mixing (Langer et al. 1999), or convective\novershooting (Herwig et al. 1997). We adopt the latter approach here, but keep in mind that overshooting\ncould be just representative for the combined effect of several physical processes acting simultaneously. In\nsynthetic models the amount of dredged-up material is adjusted to reproduce observed carbon-star statistics.\nThe physical concept of overshooting we have implemented is that of an exponentially decaying velocity\nfield outside regions formally convective according to the Schwarzschild-criterion (Freytag et al. 1996). This\nis cast into a diffusion equation\n\"\n#\n\u22122z\nDov = v0 * HP (0) exp\n(2)\nf * HP (0)\nwhere z is the distance from the boundary in the outer radiative region, HP (0) is the pressure scale height\ntaken at the boundary of the convectively unstable region, i.e. at z = 0, and v0 the typical velocity of the\nconvective elements (obtained from mixing length theory) at the inner side of the Schwarzschild border,\nfollowing Herwig et al. (1997). f is a free overshooting parameter. It represents a measure of the efficiency of\nthe extra mixing. The larger the value of f , the further the extra mixing extends outside the convective region.\nThe same approach has already been used, for example, by Herwig (2004b,a) for AGB models. The value\nfor the parameter f initially used in Herwig et al. (1997) was f = 0.02 \u2013 based on earlier main-sequence width\nfitting \u2013 to obtain sufficient third dredge-up. These authors stated that qualitatively their result do not change\nif f varies within a factor of 2. A somewhat smaller value of f = 0.016 was used by Herwig et al. (1999) and\nrepeatedly in later papers (Herwig 2000, 2004b,a). However, detailed investigations into the nucleosynthetic\nproducts of AGB-evolution with overshooting complicated the picture. While Herwig et al. (1999) emphasize\nthe need for f \u2248 0.016 for the overshooting at the bottom of the pulse-driven convective layer, in order to\nreproduce the abundance patterns of post-AGB stars of type PG1159, Lugaro et al. (2003) argue for a lower\nefficiency at the convective border (they suggest a value of 0.008) to achieve better agreement with detailed\ns-process abundance patterns. To further complicate issues, a recent 3-dimensional hydrodynamical study by\nHerwig et al. (2007) indicates a varying effective f at the bottom of the pulse-driven convection zone between\n0.01 and 0.14.\nSimilarly, to achieve sufficient efficiency of the 13 C neutron source in low-mass stars, Lugaro et al. (2003)\nused f = 0.128 for overshooting from the bottom of the convective envelope, while Herwig (2004a) finds\nthat a value of 0.03 prematurely stops the AGB evolution of a 5 M\u2299 star. One should note that these detailed\ninvestigations were done for either a single or a few stellar models, therefore the results cannot be generalized\nto all masses and metallicities.\nIn conclusion, given the unclear situation about the extent of overshooting at the lower boundary of the\npulse-driven convection zone, and the finding that the overall evolution does not change dramatically if f is\nvaried within a factor of 2, we chose to employ one value for f at all convective boundaries. This value is\nf = 0.016, which is the \"generic\" value by Herwig. For a slightly higher value of 0.018 we achieved good\nfits to galactic open clusters colour-magnitude diagrams (unpublished). We are aware that our value might be\ntoo high for the lower boundary of the pulse-driven convection zone; a conclusion recently strengthened by\nSalaris et al. (2009) from implications of the initial-final-mass relation. We will return to this in Sect. 4.2.4.\nOur choice is also in agreement with Miller Bertolami & Althaus (2006a).\nThe only exception from our procedure is overshooting from convective cores on the main sequence,\nwhere overshooting is restricted for small convective core sizes, in agreement with similar approaches found\nin, for example, Ventura et al. (1998). For 1.0 \u2264 M/M\u2299 < 1.5 the overshooting efficiency is gradually increased: starting from a value of 0 for MZAMS = 1.0M\u2299 it reaches 0.016 at MZAMS = 1.5M\u2299 . The intermediate\nvalues are given by the relation f = 0.032 * (M/M\u2299 \u2212 1.0).\nFigure 1 shows the effect of the third dredge-up on the abundances of C, N, and O and the C/O-ratio for a\nmodel of 2.6M\u2299 with a solar-like metal abundance of 0.02 (mix III of Table 1) as caused by our overshooting\n\n\f6\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nFig. 1.

The dashed line corresponds to the C/O-ratio (left\naxis).\ndescription. This model does not experience HBB. Dredge-up starts after the 6th of 14 thermal pulses. Note\nthat oxygen is enhanced, too, due to the third dredge-up.\n\n3.2. Opacities for carbon-enriched compositions\nThe carbon (and partially oxygen) enrichment of the envelope due to the third dredge-up has to be reflected\nin the treatment of the constitutional physics of the models. Where element abundances appear explicitly, as\nin the nuclear reactions, this is trivial. The use of tables for the equation of state and the Rosseland opacity\ninhibits this direct approach, however. For the equation of state, composition changes within the metal-group\nare not taken into account; generally, one assumes that due to the low abundance of individual metals, even\nafter dredge-up, the equation of state is sufficiently accurate if the total metallicity Z is taken into account\nproperly, which is the case in our calculations.\nThe situation is different for opacities, where the absorption properties can be more important than the\nabsolute abundance of an absorber. Marigo (2002) has convincingly shown that the outer envelope structure of AGB stars depends considerably on the opacities, and that in particular carbon-enriched molecular\nopacities reduce effective temperatures significantly, leading to much better agreement of colours of synthetic\npopulations with observations.\nHer adopted procedure to compute the molecular opacities, through analytical fit relations, closely resembles that of Scalo & Ulrich (1975) and is incorporated in the P. Marigo synthetic code for TP-AGB evolution,\nand in the most recent models of the Padova stellar model library (Marigo & Girardi 2007). The possibility\nto consistently compute the opacities for any chemical composition, during the evolutionary calculations is a\nhuge advantage of this approach and the effects detected in the models help to account for a number of observational properties of carbon stars. However, this has never been implemented in full stellar models, with\nthe exception of the recent and independent work by Cristallo et al. (2007), who used the molecular opacities\nof Lederer & Aringer (2008), but presented results solely for one single model (2M\u2299 ; Z = 0.0001). Recently,\nmore 2 M\u2299 models for additional metallicities became available (Cristallo et al. 2009).\n\n3.2.1. WSU tables for molecular opacities\nFor our models new opacity tables have been prepared for C-enhanced mixtures. For high temperatures,\nOPAL-tables for atomic opacities (Iglesias & Rogers 1996) were obtained from the OPAL-website2 , and for\nlow temperatures new tables for molecular opacities were specifically generated with the method and program\n2\n\nhttp://physci.llnl.gov/Research/OPAL\n\n\fA.

In all cases\nthe chemical compositions of low- and high-T tables agree and tables from the different sources are combined\nas described in Weiss & Schlattl (2008).\nTable 3.

If the C/O ratio\nis less than \u2248 1 (oxygen-stars of type M or S), stellar spectra show strong absorption bands of TiO, VO, and\nH2 O. In the other case (carbon-stars of type C or R and N), basically all O is bound in CO with CN, C2\nand SiC and some HCN and C2 H2 formed from the remaining carbon. Thus, the C/O-ratio is more important\nthan the absolute carbon abundance in the stellar mixture and therefore the additional opacity tables were\nproduced as function of varying C/O-ratio (for each choice of X, Z, and \u03b1-abundance), but not of absolute\ncarbon abundance. For the computations presented here the table values of C/O were 0.48 (solar value), 0.9,\n1.0, 1.1, 3.0, and 20. This choice was guided by an investigation of the change in the Rosseland mean opacity\ndue to variations of C/O.\nFigure 2 shows how \u03ba changes with varying C/O ratio. The most sensitive regime is around C/O \u2248 1,\nwhile for C/O > 3 hardly any change in the mean opacity is apparent. The temperature range significant\nfor AGB models is approximately log T \u2265 3.3, which justifies our grid of C/O-ratios. Ferguson & Dotter\n(2008) discuss in detail some of the important features of Fig. 2. An important point is that as the C/O ratio\nincreases the amount of O available for molecular H2 O is decreased (becomes locked in CO) thus decreasing\nthe mean opacity at temperatures important for H2 O absorption. At C/O \u2248 1, most of the molecular opacity\nis in molecular CO, a low absorber. At higher values of C/O the opacity becomes dominated by CN.\n\nFig. 2. Rosseland mean opacity \u03ba as function of temperature for a mixture with X = 0.7, Z = 0.02 and a value\nof log R = log \u03c1 \u2212 3 log T + 18 = \u22122.0. The different lines are for the various C/O-ratios of the mixtures given\nin Table 3.\n\nSet 12\nC/O = 20.0\n10.87\n9.29\n9.57\n8.47\n6.33\n7.98\n...\n\n\f8\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nRecently, Lederer & Aringer (2009) published similar opacity data for chemical mixtures with varying C and N abundances, which show similar behaviour as our data (e.g. their figure 2 and discussion in\nFerguson & Dotter (2008)). In particular, they stress that the regime around C/O=1 is the most sensitive one\nthat should be resolved well.\nTable 3 lists the relative abundances of the metals for these various C/O ratios, starting with the standard\nsolar (Sets 2-6) or \u03b1-enhanced (Sets 8-12) composition, as given in Table 2. Note that not only carbon, but\nalso oxygen and nitrogen are enhanced. This is based on the fact that the third dredge-up not only increases\ncarbon, but also these elements to some degree (see Fig. 1 for a typical case). The enhancements are typical\nvalues. Heavier elements are assumed to remain unaltered, and therefore the table ends at Mg.\nTo obtain the appropriate opacity for a point within a stellar model, the following procedure was done:\n(1) select the set of tables for the calculation, if the base mixture is either solar or \u03b1-enhanced; (2) interpolate\nwithin the X-dimension to the present hydrogen abundance for all Z and C/O-values; (3) interpolate to the\npresent Z values; and finally (4) interpolate to the correct C/O-ratio.\n\n3.2.2. Approximative molecular opacities\nIn addition to the low-temperature opacity tables discussed above, we also had access to tables for carbonenriched mixtures computed according to Marigo (2002) and kindly provided to us by P. Marigo. Here, the\ncarbon enhancement was simply added to the base solar composition, beginning at Z = 0.02. We used them\nfor initial test calculations; some of these will be compared below to our standard calculations in which the\ntables of Sect. 3.2.1 were employed.\nThe availability of the approximative and the \"ab-initio\" tables allows a brief comment on the quality\nof the approximation. We show the comparison for a very metal-rich mixture of Z = 0.04 (X = 0.7) with an\nadditional amount of carbon of 0.06 (summing up to a total metal fraction of 0.10) in Fig. 3. The log R-value is\n-3 in this plot. The upper panel shows the Marigo and WSU log \u03ba, the lower panel shows the relative difference.\nThe agreement is indeed fairly satisfying, even for this extreme carbon enhancement. The global behaviour\nas a function of temperature is recovered by the approximative opacities, and in the interesting temperature\nrange 3.3 . log T . 3.8 the deviation remains below a factor 3 at low absolute values. At temperatures above\nlog T & 3.8 differences between the computations are not understood, however we use OPAL tables at these\ntemperatures. Overall, we conclude that the Marigo approximation is well suited to describe the basic effects\nof carbon-enhancement on the temperatures of AGB stars.\n\nFig. 3. Comparison of the approximative molecular opacities by Marigo (2002) with those by the WSU group\n(see Sect. 3.2.1) for a chemical composition with solar-scaled metallicity of Z = 0.04, enriched by an additional amount of carbon of 0.06.\n\n\fA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\n9\n\n3.3. Mass loss\nMass loss is a decisive aspect of AGB evolution since it determines how and when the TP-AGB phase ends,\nwhat yields can be expected from intermediate-mass stars, and since it also influences possible nuclear reactions at the bottom of the convective envelope. In the absence of a complete theory for mass loss, simple mass\nloss formulas are implemented in stellar codes. They are obtained by fitting either empirical data or, if available, theoretical mass loss models. The most widely known formulas used for AGB evolution calculations are\nthose by Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) and Bloecker (1995a). In addition to mass loss on the AGB, including\nthe \"superwind\" phase, which terminates this evolutionary phase, also the AGB\u2013post-AGB transition phase,\nthe post-AGB evolution at increasingly higher T eff , and the previous phases should be covered, although mass\nloss there is rather insignificant when compared to that on the AGB.\nIn this investigation we employed the following mass loss prescriptions: As the basic formula, in particular\nfor the RGB evolution, the Reimers relation (Reimers 1975) is used.\n\u1e40R = \u22124 * 10\u221213\n\n(L/L\u2299 )(R/R\u2299 )\n\u03b7R .\n(M/M\u2299 )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b7R was set to 1.0 for stars with initial mass larger than 1.7M\u2299 , following Bloecker (1995a). For models\nwith smaller ZAMS masses, a more standard value of 0.4 has been chosen as in Karakas (2003). In practice,\nthe mass loss resulting from Eq. 3 is insignificant with the exception of the RGB evolution of low-mass stars.\nOnce on the AGB, observed mass loss rates are higher than the standard Reimers wind would indicate. The\ncommon picture is that the winds are driven by radiation\u2013dust interactions, where the dust production itself is\ntriggered or enhanced by radial pulsations (see Wallerstein & Knapp 1998; Sedlmayr & Winters 1997). At the\npresent time, thorough theoretical radiation-hydrodynamical models including dust production are available\nonly for carbon-rich chemical compositions, in which nearly all oxygen is bound in CO, and the excessive\ncarbon gives rise to carbon-based molecules and dust. The Berlin group has published both models and fitting\nformulas for such cases (e.g. Fleischer et al. 1992; Arndt et al. 1997; Winters et al. 1997). We are employing\nhere the mass loss rate by Wachter et al. (2002),\n!\n\u22124 L\nlog \u1e40AGB = \u22124.52 + 2.47 * log 10\nL\u2299\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012 T\nM\neff\n\u2212 1.95 * log\n.\n(4)\n\u22126.81 * log\n2600K\nM\u2299\nThis formula does not include any dependence on the actual C/O-ratio as did an earlier formulation by\nFleischer (1994), which was used by Wagenhuber (1996), the first work to include a mass loss rate based\non such models. Wachter et al. (2002) showed that the dependence of the mass loss rate on the C/O-ratio is\nweak enough to be ignored in comparison with all other uncertainties. This statement, however, was obtained\nfrom investigating models at solar metallicity. In Wachter et al. (2008) the same models were used to derive\nsimilar fit formulas for LMC and SMC metallicities. Although the dependence on C/O was again neglected,\nthe coefficients in the equations corresponding to Eq. 4 are different. We speculate that these coefficients\nalso contain the hidden effect that for a given C/O-ratio the absolute number of unbound, therefore available\ncarbon atoms differs between different total metallicities. This is, according to Mattsson et al. (2008), the decisive quantity. Since both papers appeared after our computations were already performed, the metallicity\ndependence could not be taken into account.\nThe second obvious dependence on pulsation period has been implicitly included in the L-term according\nto the period-luminosity relation by Groenewegen & Whitelock (1996).\nFor the case of oxygen stars, i.e. C/O < 1, we used the empirical fitting formula by van Loon et al. (2005)\nobtained from dust-enshrouded oxygen-rich AGB stars:\n!\nL\nlog \u1e40AGB = \u22125.65 + 1.05 * log 10\u22124\nL\u2299\n\u0013\n\u0012 T\neff\n.\n(5)\n\u22126.3 * log\n3500K\nThis rate is applicable only to stars with a pulsation period P > 400 days. Similar period cuts of 400 and\n100 days have been employed by Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) and Bloecker (1995a). In accordance with the\nlatter reference, we use the Ostlie & Cox (1986) estimate of the pulsation period for Mira variables of given\nmass and radius, and apply Eqs. 4 and 5 if P > 400 days. For the carbon-rich case, Wachter et al. (2002)\nactually give a lower critical luminosity, but in our calculations it turned out that models reach the critical\npulsation period as oxygen-rich stars and only later become carbon-stars at a higher luminosity.\n\n\f10\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nAs a star leaves the AGB after a \"superwind\" has removed most of its envelope, T eff increases and the\nabove formulae lead to a quickly vanishing stellar wind. For this transition to the post-AGB phase no suitable mass loss formula is available. Sch\u00f6nberner & Steffen (2007) argue, based on hydro-simulations of dust\nenvelopes around evolving post-AGB stars, that the strong mass loss should pertain up to effective temperatures of 5000 or 6000 K. We mimic this by keeping the AGB-wind mass loss rates until P has decreased to\n150 days. From there to P = 100 days, taken to be the beginning of the post-AGB phase, a linear transition to\nthe post-AGB wind is done. From there on, we again use the Reimers relation (Eq. 3), or, if the rate is larger,\nthe radiation-driven wind formula already used by Bloecker (1995b), and based on Pauldrach et al. (1988),\nnamely:\n\u1e40CSPN = \u22121.29 * 10\u221215 L1.86 .\n\n(6)\n\nFigure 4 shows an illustrative example about the relative size of the mass loss due to the various prescriptions and the rate actually used in the evolution of a 5M\u2299 star of solar-like composition on the AGB. On the\nearly AGB a Reimers wind of \u03b7R = 1 is assumed; after three of the thermal pulses shown in this figure, the\ncritical 400 d pulsation period is reached and mass loss according to Eq. 5 is applied. This leads to an increase\nin \u1e40 by an order of magnitude. Before the last TP of the figure dredge-up turns the model into a carbon star\nand we switch to the dust-driven wind of Eq. 4 (W02), which is slightly above the van Loon mass loss rate\n(VL05). Notice that both types of wind show a drop at this point, due to an increase in effective temperature\nwhich is caused by the carbon-enhanced opacities. This is one of the events we encountered, where a value\nof C/O > 1 does not lead to the expected decrease in T eff , and which will be discussed below. Note also the\nsteeper rise of \u1e40 with time, i.e. luminosity, for the dust-driven wind (W02).\n\nFig. 4.

The colored dashed lines give the rates from each of the individual prescriptions according\nto Eq. 3 (Reimers), 4 (W02), or 5 (VL05).

Overview about pre-AGB evolution\nAlthough the evolution up to the TP-AGB phase is of less interest in the context of this paper, we briefly\ndiscuss these initial phases. Tables A.1 and A.2 list lifetimes on the main-sequence, the RGB (to be understood\nas the time between the end of central hydrogen and the beginning of central helium burning), the core helium\nburning, and until the onset of the first thermal pulse. In addition, total mass and core mass at the first TP are\nincluded.\nIn Fig. A.1 we compare main-sequence lifetimes of our models with those by Karakas (2003, K03) and\nVassiliadis & Wood (1993, VW93) for which chemical compositions agree. Both sets include metallicities of\n0.004 and 0.008, K03 also has a case with Z = 0.02, but VW93 provides Z = 0.016 only. The latter set has\nalways Y = 0.25, while K03 has varying helium contents of 0.2476, 0.2551, 0.2928 for the three metallicities\n(from low to high Z). In addition, both sets exclude core overshooting, and have older opacities and nuclear\nreaction rates. At the lowest metallicity, where composition differences are smallest, main-sequence ages\nbetween all three sets agree to better than 10%. The generally longer lifetimes of our models with respect to\nK03, most pronounced for Z = 0.02, can be understood as a result of overshooting. Indeed, when repeating\nthe calculations without overshooting (black triangles in the lowest left panel of Fig. A.1) both sets agree to\na few per cent. The generally longer lifetimes of VW93 models can be traced back to their higher hydrogen\nabundance, which not only provides more nuclear fuel, but also decreases surface temperatures due to higher\nopacities and, because of the lowered molecular weight, lowers the luminosities of the models.\nFor the core helium burning lifetimes the discrepancies are much larger. Our models for stars above 2 M\u2299\nhave lifetimes shorter by several factors of 10%. Similar discrepancies exist between the K03 and VW93\nmodels. Our lifetimes agree best with those of the Padova library (Girardi et al. 2000), which we also consulted for comparison. As already discussed by K03, this phase is very uncertain due to its dependence on the\n12\nC(\u03b1, \u03b3)16 O reaction rate and the treatment of overshooting and semi-convection.\nThe ignition of helium could be followed in all our models, independent of whether this happened under\nnon-degenerate conditions in the intermediate-mass stars, or as a core helium flash in low-mass stars. No\nartificial setup of post-flash models was therefore needed (Serenelli & Weiss 2005).\nThe pre-AGB phase ends with the first thermal pulse, defined as the first pulse in which a helium luminosity of 104 L\u2299 is reached. This definition coincides either with the first appearance of the pulse-driven\nconvection zone, or with one pulse earlier than that. In general, such a pulse is not yet fully developed. At\nthis stage, the mass of the hydrogen-free core is a quantity of interest, as the future growth of the core is\nimportant for the initial-final-mass relation. In Fig. A.1, right column, we compare the core mass at the first\nthermal pulse with the values by K03. While they agree very well for the intermediate mass stars, ours are\nsystematically lower for low-mass stars. In particular they show the characteristic minimum value around\n2 M\u2299 , while the K03 models show only a very shallow variation below 2.5 M\u2299 . In the case of Z = 0.02 we\nalso added values obtained by Miller Bertolami (2008, private communication). They are shown as blue diamonds and agree very well with our numbers. Miller Bertolami uses the same overshooting prescription as we\ndo. Ignoring overshooting, core masses tend to be smaller for those stars with convective cores on the main\nsequence. These core masses are displayed for the same metallicity as black triangles. In view of the fact that\nK03 did not include overshooting, the agreement between her core masses and those of our models is in fact\nanother sign of discrepancy.\nWe close this overview by mentioning that the influence of \u03b1-enhancement at identical Z is such that\nlifetimes are generally shorter and core masses at the first TP slightly larger (see Tables A.1 and A.2).\n\n4.2. AGB synopsis\n4.2.1. Overall properties\nThe evolution of a sample model (M = 2 M\u2299 , Z = 0.02 with solar metal ratios) along the AGB is shown in\nFig. 4.2.1. We plot key quantities such as luminosity, effective temperature, pulsation period, mass loss rate,\nand C/O-ratio at the surface. The model experiences in total 15 TPs; the third dredge-up (3du) starts at the\nsecond TP and continues until the end of the AGB; the mass loss rate switches from an enhanced Reimers\nwind to \u1e40AGB according to Eq. 5 at TP 9, when the pulsation period reaches the critical 400 days, and finally\nto the dust-driven \u1e40AGB (Eq. 4) stage once C/O > 1 is reached during the second last TP. At this epoch a clear\ndrop in T eff is visible, which is the direct consequence of the carbon-rich opacity tables we are using. The\nstrong dust-driven wind leads to a \"superwind\" which removes within one interpulse period more than 1 M\u2299 .\nThe remaining, nearly bare core starts the post-AGB evolution at much higher T eff and a reduced stellar wind.\n\n\f12\n\nA.

Equivalent tables for all other mixtures are contained in the on-line material (Tables B.1\u2013B.4)\n\nDespite all numerical improvements, we still encountered convergence problems such that only part of the\nmodels could be evolved to the very end of the AGB, which we defined as the point when the model leaves\nthe AGB towards hotter T eff and the pulsation period has dropped below 100 days. These convergence problems can be traced back to a dominance of radiation pressure within the convective envelopes, and have been\nreported and identified as early as in Wood & Faulkner (1986), but also by, e.g., Karakas (2003), Herwig\n(2005, private communication), Miller Bertolami & Althaus (2006b), and Karakas & Lattanzio (2007). In\nsome cases the convergence problems could be circumvented by artificially stripping off the remaining envelope and relaxation of the resulting model, by increasing the mixing length parameter, or by shifting more\nmass into an energetically inert outer envelope (which our models do not have). None of these methods worked\nsatisfactorily for us, such that we decided to stop the calculation when convergence problems became insurmountable. In most cases, in particular for lower masses, the models evolved to virtually the end of the AGB\nphase. For example, the 1 M\u2299 star of Table 4 crashed during the final flash, when it was departing from the\nAGB during the third dredge-up. In such cases, due to the amount of mass loss and the size of the remaining\nenvelope, an estimate of the TPs and time still needed to complete the TP-AGB phase can be safely done.\nThis estimate is given in Table 4 as the second last column (te ; missing TPs in brackets) and added in the final\ncolumn to the actual AGB lifetime at which the end of the computations was reached (tmod ). We follow the\napproach by Karakas (2003). From Tables 4 and B.1\u2013B.4 it is evident, that up to M = 4 M\u2299 at most 2 TPs are\nmissing for the complete AGB evolution, but that for higher masses a substantial part of the AGB is missed.\nAltogether 100 out of 110 sequences reached that advanced stage, with 79 missing less than 3 TPs. For the\ntwo lowest metallicities some models experienced convergence problems so early on the TP-AGB that we did\nnot include them in these tables.\nWe show as examples the evolutionary paths of two of our models in the Hertzsprung-Russell-Diagram\n(Fig. 6), calculated with all physical details discussed in Sect. 3. The 5 M\u2299 star (of the typical LMC composition V) experiences 38 TPs in total. Dredge-up occurs from the first TP, and is sufficient to turn the star\ninto a carbon star. The dredge-up is competing, however, with strong HBB between TPs 9 and 24, which\n\n\f14\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nFig. 6. Evolution of two of our models. Shown are stars of 5 M\u2299 with Z = 0.008 (solar-scaled) and 2.6 M\u2299\nwith Z = 0.04 (\u03b1-enhanced).\nreduces C/O to a final value close to 1. During the last three pulses the convergence problems increased and\nthe evolution in the HRD became irregular. We do not show these last TPs.\nThe second star with M = 2.6 M\u2299 and an \u03b1-enhanced mixture of Z = 0.04 (possibly representative for an\nextreme bulge composition) experienced 16 TPs and dredge-up after the 9th TP, which increased Z to 0.048.\nThe decrease of T eff between pulses, clearly visible in Fig. 6 is the consequence of this overall metallicity\nincrease due to dredge-up of mainly C and O, and to a lesser extent of N. Although C/O more than doubles to\n0.432, the star does not become a carbon star; mass loss is strong according to Eq. 5. This star finally leaves\nthe AGB during the last TP, and turns to hotter temperatures, but the calculations ended before it reached the\npost-AGB phase, due to the mentioned convergence problems.\n\n4.2.2. Influence of composition\nOur models recover some previously known trends with mass and metallicity. The 3du is more pronounced\nfor lower metallicity and higher mass. This is also reflected in the C/O-values. For the highest masses, HBB\nreduces carbon. It sets in earlier for lower metallicity. While this is consistent with, e.g., Karakas (2003),\nthe C/O ratios reached in her models are generally higher than ours, up to 20 compared to about 5 in our\ncase. It should be kept in mind that the amount of dredge-up depends crucially on the method to obtain it:\nwhile we use overshooting, Karakas (2003) achieves it by extending the convective regions to a point of\nmarginal stability, but does so only for the lower boundary of the convective envelope. Her models do not\ncontain any overshooting from the pulse-driven convective layers, and therefore less C and O are mixed from\nthe core into the intershell layers. As Herwig (2000, Figs. 11 and 12) has demonstrated, overshooting leads\nto relatively more oxygen than carbon enhancement, and therefore to lower C/O-ratios. This is a reason for\nour lower surface C/O-ratios. According to Herwig (2000) and Werner & Herwig (2006) the present surfaces\nof hot, hydrogen-deficient post-AGB stars of type PG1159 and [WC] have formerly been interior layers\nof AGB stars, uncovered by late AGB or post-AGB thermal pulses. If that is indeed the case, these stars\npresent a valuable test for the intershell composition of stars along the AGB. In most cases (see Table 1 of\nWerner & Herwig 2006), the observed C/O-ratio is below 10, and clusters around values of 3\u20135, which would\nconfirm the lower values resulting from the inclusion of overshooting from the He-driven convective zone.\nSimilarly, C/O-ratios in planetary nebulae are, in spite of all difficulties in determining them, in most cases\nwell below our maximum value of 5 (see Liu et al. 2004, for a comprehensive and thorough analysis), and\nnever reach values close to 10 (see also P\u00e9quignot et al. 2000, for two PNe in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy).\nHBB occurs in the models of Karakas (2003) and in those by Herwig (2004a) around M = 3.5 M\u2299 ; our\nmodels show this only at higher masses (M = 5 M\u2299 and above).\nA new feature of our grid is the use of solar-scaled and \u03b1-enhanced metal distributions. We find that there\nis no significant influence on the number of TPs or the occurrence of 3du and HBB. The core mass at the\nonset of TPs and the 3du tends to be larger by a few 10\u22123 M\u2299 and the final C/O ratio tends to be lower. Since\nC/O is initially only 0.19 in the \u03b1-enhanced mixtures, it is clear that an enhanced 3du is needed to convert\n\n\fA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\n15\n\nFig. 7.

As a general rule, the \u03b1-enhanced models need about 1-2 TPs more to achieve a\nsimilar C/O-ratio. This is the reason why the 2.6 M\u2299 model of Fig. 6 does not turn into a carbon star in spite\nof dredge-up.\n\n4.2.3. Comparison with other models\nThe comparison with the results of Karakas (2003) and Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) with respect to TP-AGB\nlifetimes and number of thermal pulses is shown in Fig. 7. Our models show the same global behaviour with\na maximum of tTP at the lowest initial mass that starts core helium burning under non-degenerate conditions\nand therefore has the lowest core mass, which leads to the longest interpulse times. Note, however, that the\nK03 models for Z = 0.004 show an untypical behaviour at the lowest Mi . Lifetimes and number of thermal\npulses of our models are typically lower than in the other two calculations, in particular for higher masses.\nThis is due to our mass loss formulas, which lead to globally higher mass loss rates, in particular after C/Oratio exceeds unity (Fig. 4). Although the differences in the physical input for the calculations are larger in\ncomparison with VW93, Fig. 7 shows a better agreement with these older calculations. The larger differences\nbetween K03 and VW93 (both use the same mass loss description) have no explanation. The influence of the\nmetal distributions (solar-scaled or \u03b1-enhanced) is shown in Fig. 4.2.3. Generally, lifetimes on the TP-AGB\nare shorter for the \u03b1-enhanced mixtures, although the number of pulses tends to be slightly higher (see above).\n\n4.2.4. Final core mass\nAs another global quantity we present in this section the final core mass, shown in Fig. 4.2.4, at the end of\nthe TP-AGB evolution for all ten mixtures as well as the comparison with the results by K03 for the three\nmixtures in common. The comparison shows a generally good agreement with K03 for higher stellar masses,\nbut much lower Mcore values at lower stellar masses. This is the consequence of the lower core mass at the\nfirst TP, visible also in Fig. A.1, and the effect of our overshooting prescription, which prevents the core from\ngrowing substantially. This indicates that our overshooting prescription, in particular always using the same\novershooting parameter at all convective boundaries may lead to an overestimate of the effect of overshooting.\n\n\f16\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nFig. 8. Lifetimes on the thermally pulsing AGB as function of initial mass for all our models and chemical\ncompositions. Left: \u03b1-enhanced metal ratios; right: solar-scaled.\n\nFig. 9. Left: Final core mass of all our models (solid lines: solar-scaled metal ratios; dotted lines: \u03b1-enhanced).\nRight: Comparison with K03 results (dashed).\n\nSalaris et al. (2009) and Lugaro et al. (2003) have argued that the overshooting from the base of the pulsedriven convective layer in the He-shell should be somewhat smaller during the core hydrogen burning to allow\nthe core to grow and to be in better agreement with 3d-hydrodynamical simulations by Herwig et al. (2007).\nIn terms of the parameter f in Eq. 2 the numerical value should be f . 0.01 instead of our standard value of\n0.016. Indeed, core masses of our models grow during the TP-AGB phase by less than 0.02 M\u2299 except in the\nmass range between 2 and 4 M\u2299 , where the growth reaches 0.04 * * * 0.06 M\u2299 (more for larger metallicities).\nOur predicted initial\u2013final\u2013mass\u2013relation (IFMR) is therefore very close to the relation between initial\nmass and core mass at the first TP. This is evident from Fig. 4.2.4, which shows that our IFMR is a lower\nenvelope \u2013 at least at the low-mass end \u2013 to the empirical data for clusters with [Fe/H] \u2248 0.0. The initial\nsolar metallicity lies somewhere between the two cases shown. This constitutes a mild discrepancy with the\nobservations for the lower initial mass range, where our predicted IFMR drops below the semi-empirical\nrelation by Weidemann (2000). It agrees well with one by Miller Bertolami (2007; private communication),\nshown in Salaris et al. (2009), who used a very similar overshooting description as we do. The final core\nmasses of K03, shown in Fig. 4.2.4, on the other hand, are higher than the empirical relation for M \u2264 3 M\u2299 .\n\n\fA. Weiss and J.W.

The\ninitial (Mi ) and final (Mf ) mass values and associated error bars are taken from Salaris et al. (2009).\n\n4.2.5. Analytical fits\nSynthetic AGB calculations make use of analytical relationships between key quantities of full AGB models.\nAmong them, the core-mass \u2013 luminosity and the core-mass \u2013 interpulse-period relations are two crucial\nones. A number of such relations are available in the literature. We mention here the early linear one by\nPaczy\u0144ski (1970), the one used by Marigo et al. (1996, M96), which includes a dependency on the envelope\ncomposition, and the two most recent and complex relations by Wagenhuber & Groenewegen (1998, WG98)\nand Izzard et al. (2004, I04). They are based on the models by Wagenhuber (1996) and Karakas (2003),\nrespectively, and also include dependencies on composition, mixing length parameter, hot bottom burning and\ndredge-up. Since the latter two effects differ between calculations, it cannot be expected that such detailed\nrelations agree very well with our new models, which incorporate the additional effects of overshooting,\nopacities for varying C/O-ratios, and mass loss prescription. Nevertheless, a detailed comparison was done\nby Kitsikis (2008), which we will not repeat here. He found that with respect to the core-mass \u2013 luminosity\nrelation, the one by M96 agrees best for low-mass models, because our models have generally lower core\nmasses for a given luminosity. This is related to the low-mass discrepancy found above for the IFMR. For\nMcore & 0.7 M\u2299 both the I04 and WG98 relations describe our models equally well. The deviations, however,\nalways remain within the 10 to 20% range. With respect to the core-mass \u2013 interpulse-period relation the\nWG98 description fits our models best. Part of the deviation were traced back by Kitsikis (2008) to the effect\nof the new opacities on luminosity and interpulse time. A new adaption of the WG98 analytical description to\nour new models seems promising, but awaits completion. If synthetic models require an average accuracy at\nthe 10% level, the fits by WG98 and I04 might still be used.\n\n4.3. Effect of varying C/O-ratio\nSince we emphasized a consistent treatment of the carbon enrichment of the envelopes in this work, we will\nnow discuss in detail how this influences the models. We start with a comparison of cases with different sets of\nopacity tables. This illustrative test was done for a solar composition (mixture III) and a mass of 2 M\u2299 . Mass\nloss was strongly reduced to prevent an amplification of differences in the models due to sensitive mass loss\nrates. The C/O-ratio and the effective temperature evolution are shown in Fig. 4.3 for three different cases.\nThe early AGB evolution up to the 7th TP is not shown. Different 3du histories explain why the C/O ratio is\nnot the same in all cases.\nThe black dotted line corresponds to the use of opacity tables with no specific treatment of the C/O-ratio.\nThis implies that any increase in carbon abundance is taken into account only by using opacity tables of higher\nmetallicity, but still solar metal ratios. The solid blue line is using the Marigo (2002) molecular opacities. Here,\nany increase in metallicity is ascribed to be due to C only, irrespective of the actual C/O ratio. Generally, the\n\n\f18\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nFig. 11. Evolution of a model with M = 2 M\u2299 and Z = 0.02 (solar) on the AGB using different sets of\nopacity tables. Black lines correspond to the new WSU molecular opacities (Sect. 3.2.1), the blue one to the\napproximative molecular opacities by Marigo (2002, Sect. 3.2.2). The black dotted line refers to calculations\nwhere only the total metallicity, but not the change in C/O due to the third dredge-up is accounted for.\n\nC/O ratio is overestimated in these tables, such that the influence on the opacities is exaggerated. These\nmolecular opacities were taken into account in our calculations, when the C/O ratio in the models exceeded\nunity, or when the total metallicity reached Z \u2248 0.03, which is the case shown in the figure. This implies a\nsudden jump in opacity, and a corresponding sudden decrease in T eff , visible at t = 1328.5 Myr. As such a\njump creates in some cases numerical problems in the calculations, we applied the switch to the molecular\nopacities during the interpulse phase. The lower T eff then leads to stronger dredge-up in the following TPs.\nCompared to the equivalent case of ignoring carbon enhancement in the opacities, T eff drops by up to 0.07 dex\nduring the final 5 TPs. The level of carbon enhancement (upper panel of Fig. 4.3) is increased with respect to\nthe fixed C/O case.\nThe WSU opacity tables, introduced in Sect. 3.2.1, in contrast follow the C/O-ratio in detail, therefore the\nslow increase in carbon has a smooth influence on T eff (black solid line).While the WSU molecular opacities\nalso lead to a decrease in T eff , interestingly initially, when C/O is approaching unity, this decrease of T eff\nis less pronounced than in the case where carbon enhancement is taken into account as a general increase\nof an otherwise solar-scaled metallicity (dotted black line). However, when looking at Fig. 2, it is evident\nthat indeed up to log T eff \u2248 3.5 the Rosseland mean opacity first decreases with increasing C/O and only for\nC/O > 1 begins to increase again. Although the physical conditions (Z, log R) of that figure are not quite the\none encountered in the models shown in Fig. 4.3, this case is very representative. The reason for the initial\ndrop is the reduced number of TiO and H2 O molecules, which for O-rich mixtures are a major source of\nopacity. Eventually, when C/O & 1.2, the C/O-variable opacities are higher and T eff drops stronger. In our\nset of tables of Marigo's molecular opacities, we do not have mixtures with C/O \u2248 1, such that the opacity\nminimum cannot be recovered. This explains why the solid blue line does not show this weaker decrease\nof the effective temperature as a consequence of carbon enhancement. We emphasize that T eff in all cases\ncontinues to decrease during the TP-AGB phase, but at different rates depending on the detailed treatment of\nC-enhancement.\nA similar case is shown in Fig. 4.3. Here, we employ our standard mass loss treatment. We compare only\nthe case of ignoring or including variable C/O-ratios. The opacity tables (WSU molecular opacities) are the\nsame in both cases. When dredge-up begins (at the third full TP), the C/O-variable opacities again lead to\nhigher T eff as compared to the fixed-C/O opacity tables. As a consequence, dredge-up is more effective for the\ncase, in which the increase in carbon is only taken into account by using opacities for higher Z, but still solar\nC/O. Only when C/O & 2 (TP no. 6), the increase in carbon is reflected by higher opacities, lower T eff , and\na more efficient 3du, such that the blue line is catching up in the upper panel of Fig. 4.3.

As a consequence\nof the lower T eff , mass loss is higher and the evolution stops earlier in the \"variable opacities\" case.\nThis effect of an initially shallower T eff -decrease as a consequence of carbon-enrichment of the envelope\nis more pronounced for lower overall metallicity, as can be inferred already from Figs. 4.3 and 4.3. We have\nverified this with a further test case at our lowest metallicity (M = 1.8 M\u2299 , Z = 0.0005). The reason is that with\ndecreasing metallicity the opacity maximum for C/O > 1 is shifting from log T \u2248 3.4 for Z = 0.02 (Fig. 2) to\nlog T \u2248 3.35 for Z = 0.0003 (which is the table metallicity closest to that of the model, see Fig. 13), and that\nthe C-rich opacities are no longer higher at log T \u2248 3.5. This effect is confirmed by Cristallo et al. (2007, their\nFig. 4) for their 2 M\u2299 , Z = 0.0001 model, calculated also with carbon-enhanced molecular opacities. As a\nconsequence of the higher temperatures of C-enhanced models, mass loss is decreased and TP-AGB lifetimes\nprolonged. This figure also shows that when C-enhancement is not taken into account at all, i.e. if Z is kept\nconstant, T eff is hardly decreasing at all. The same influence of an increasing C/O-ratio on the Rosseland mean\nopacity can be found in the data by Lederer & Aringer (2009, their Fig. 2).\n\n4.4. Carbon-stars lifetimes\nThe interaction between dredge-up, low-temperature opacities, and mass loss determines for what duration a\nstellar model is a C-star. Since our calculations differ from previous full AGB models in those aspects, we\nexpect that carbon-star lifetimes will be modified considerably. We show in Fig. 4.4 the C-star lifetimes of\nour models for all 10 compositions. The efficiency of the 3du, which rises with lower metallicity, leads to the\npronounced peaks for Z = 0.004 and Z = 0.008, but the lowest metallicity models have a much smaller peak.\nThe location of the lifetime peak shifts to lower initial mass with decreasing metallicity, although for Z = 0.02\nit is not very pronounced. Note that the Z = 0.04 case is missing as for this metallicity our models do not turn\ninto carbon stars (Table B.1).\nGirardi & Marigo (2007) have derived the C-star lifetime from star counts in clusters of both Magellanic\nclouds. Their Fig. 3 shows a comparison of these with synthetic AGB population predictions. They\nnote that the carbon-star luminosity function could be reproduced successfully only since the work of\nGroenewegen & de Jong (1993), but that even this model, as well as all previous ones underestimated the\nC-star lifetime peak for initial masses below 3 M\u2299 , and overestimated it for higher masses. Marigo (2002),\nintroducing the C-variable molecular opacities managed to obtain an acceptable fit to the observed data. In\nFig. 4.4 we compare the data by Girardi & Marigo (2007) for the LMC with the predicted lifetimes of our\nown models with Z = 0.008 (upper panel) and for the SMC with models with Z = 0.004 (lower panel; both\nfor solar-scaled metallicities). In both cases, but in particular for the LMC, the agreement is quite satisfying,\n\n\f20\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nFig. 13. As Fig. 2, but for Z = 0.0003.

Note also that the C-star lifetimes are much lower for initially\n\u03b1-enhanced composition (Fig. 4.4, dotted lines). As we mentioned before this is simply a consequence of the\ninitially lower C/O-ratio that requires more 3du episodes.\n\n4.5. Post-AGB evolution\nAt the end of the AGB-phase, the models evolve to higher T eff with decreasing pulsation period. To date the\nlargest set of post-AGB tracks are still the 27 tracks by Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) for the same metallicities as in Vassiliadis & Wood (1993), and covering the post-AGB mass range from 0.558 M\u2299 to 0.943 M\u2299.\nThese post-AGB models are in fact the continuation of the AGB-models of Vassiliadis & Wood (1993), and\nconstitute the very rare case of continuous evolutionary models that evolve from the main-sequence to the\nwhite dwarf cooling stage. In our case, as mentioned before, we encountered severe convergence problems\nfor many models, which are similar to those reported, e.g., by Wood & Faulkner (1986), Herwig (2005),\n\n\fA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\n21\n\nFig. 15. Lifetimes of carbon stars, \u03c4C in the LMC (upper panel) and SMC (lower panel). The observational\ndata and error-bars are from the compilation by Girardi & Marigo (2007), the dotted lines correspond to our\nmodel predictions for the two appropriate compositions with solar-scaled metal ratios, as given in the figure.\n\nMiller Bertolami & Althaus (2006b), and Karakas & Lattanzio (2007). From the 100 tracks evolved to the\nend of the AGB, or sufficiently close to it, only 60 could be followed through the post-AGB phase. They are\nall from initial masses in the range of 1 to 2 M\u2299 . Half of them could be computed continuously, for the other\nhalf we had to \"freeze\" the models at the end of the AGB, remove the remaining envelope, and resume the\nfull evolution at sufficiently higher temperature. In many cases this was successful only when T eff \u2248 104 K,\nwhich is a standard definition for the start of the post-AGB evolution (Vassiliadis & Wood 1994; Marigo et al.\n2004). The time between the beginning departure from the AGB and this point is taken as the transition time\nttr . We derive ttr in those cases where we have continuous models as the time between the model for which\nthe pulsation period has dropped to 100 days and the T eff = 104 K point. As a consequence of the restricted\ninitial mass range for which we were able to follow the post-AGB evolution, post-AGB stellar masses ranged\nonly between 0.5 and 0.6 M\u2299 . About one third of our models experience a late or very late TP (LTP or VLTP)\nduring their horizontal crossing of the HRD respectively on the WD cooling track. The calculations were\nstopped when they had returned to the AGB for the second time. Such models had to be followed in each case\nseparately to overcome the numerical difficulties.\nSince our post-AGB grid is restricted in mass, we refer to Kitsikis (2008) for the detailed results. Here we\nsummarize only a few key points. Of the 30 cases for which we could follow the complete evolution without\nintervention, 4 left the AGB as He-burners (defined as leaving the AGB through a pulse cycle phase below\n0.15). Although this number is as low as that in Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) and Bloecker (1995b), it cannot\nbe compared directly, since in both these cases most He-burners originate from born-again stars, i.e. stars that\nexperienced a (V)LTP. Including this fact, our fraction of He-burners would be higher. On the other hand,\nwe can expect that models with higher initial mass, if we could follow them to the post-AGB, would reduce\nthe fraction of He-burners. This is because our mass-loss description favors envelope ejection during the late\nTP-cycle only for low-mass stars, while for higher masses the mass loss rate remains high through a large\nfraction of the interpulse phase, too.\nThe transition times greatly depend upon the definition of the post-AGB phase and the termination of\nthe final AGB-superwind. Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) begin the post-AGB evolution between temperatures\nof 3500 K and 5000 K, while those by Bloecker (1995b) start between 6000 K and 7900 K. Our definition\nof the 100 d pulsation period leads to an earlier post-AGB start, corresponding to T eff \u2248 3800 * * * 5400 K.\nSimilarly, the post-AGB mass loss description influences the transition speed. Vassiliadis & Wood (1994)\nrather abruptly switch to radiation-driven winds, which for T eff < 10000, the end of the transition phase, is\nlower than our adopted Reimers-type wind (Eq. 3), which is similar to the approach by Bloecker (1995b). As\na result, ttr ranges from a few hundred to about 2000 yrs for most of our models, with a slight tendency to\nincrease for lower masses and higher metallicities (up to \u2248 10000 yrs for Z = 0.04).

The overlap in post-AGB mass with Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) is very restricted; their ttr\nin the mass range in common with us is up to ten times longer. According to Sch\u00f6nberner & Steffen (2007)\npost-AGB stars have T eff & 5000 K and transition times around 1000 yrs, as inferred from hydrodynamical\nstudies. Our models thus show a reasonable agreement with these results.\nTwo further timescales of the post-AGB evolution are of interest. The first one is the time until the\nradiation-driven hot wind of Eq. 6 sets in (technically the point, when it is larger than the Reimers wind\nof Eq. 3). Since our post-AGB mass loss description is very similar to that by Bloecker (1995a), we can compare this timescale t1 , but only for the mass in common, M = 0.6 M\u2299 , where his t1 is 1700 yrs while ours is\nt1 \u2248 500 yrs. This is close to that by Bloecker (1995a) for M = 0.625 M\u2299, who finds an increase in t1 with\ndecreasing mass, strongest for the lowest masses, which we confirm.\nThe second timescale is the total crossing time, tcr , taken from T eff = 104 K to the turn-around point at\nthe \"knee\" of the post-AGB evolution, typically around T eff \u2248 105 K. In Fig. 4.5 we compare our results with\nthose by Vassiliadis & Wood (1994). Our values for ttr are lower because of the faster early evolution on the\npost-AGB. However, some basic features are similar: A strong increase in tcr with decreasing mass, higher\nvalues for lower metallicities at the same mass, longer crossing times for He-burner, and a majority of values\nbelow or around 104 years.\nA summary of the various timescales is given in Tables C.1 and C.2. The meaning of the various columns\nin these tables is as follows: (1) initial stellar mass on ZAMS; (2) T eff at which post-AGB evolution starts; a\nstar indicates that this is not the point with a pulsation period of 100 d, but rather the first model after \"frozen-\n\n\fA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\n23\n\nin\" envelope stripping; (3) stellar mass at T eff = 104 K; (4) transition time between the post-AGB start and\nT eff = 104 d (this is a lower limit for the cases marked by a star); (5) time t1 between beginning of post-AGB\nevolution and onset of radiation-driven wind; (6) time tcr for crossing of HRD; (7) H- or He-burner, or both,\nif a LTP or VLTP (indicated by column 8) happens; (9) end of the calculations: \"WD\" indicates that the WD\ncooling track was reached; otherwise the computations were ended due to numerical problems in the phase\nindicated.\nSince some of our models experience a LTP or VLTP (see Tables C.1 and C.2, from which also the\ninitial post-AGB mass MT4 is taken), we provide in Table 5 the \"born-again times\" tba , taken as the time\nbetween the maximum hydrogen-luminosity after a (very) late TP has occurred and the moment the star\narrives again at log T eff = 3.8 (Miller Bertolami & Althaus 2007). Observationally, (e.g. Asplund 1999, for\nSakurai's object), tba is as short as a few years, while theoretical models (e.g. Herwig et al. 1999; Herwig\n2001) predict several hundred years. However, Miller Bertolami et al. (2006) obtained born-again times of\n5-10 years by using an extremely fine time resolution. As was pointed out by Herwig (2001), care has to be\ntaken with regard to the shortest time steps. The reason is that the mixing length theory is applicable only\nto stationary convective situations. The adjustment of convection to changing conditions is not considered.\nTherefore, time-steps shorter than typical convective turn-over times are inconsistent with the assumptions of\nmixing length theory, if convective layers are changing quickly. This may be the case during the fast rise of\ntemperature due to violent nuclear burning, as is the case in the hot hydrogen burning regions of a born-again\nstar. The typical turn-over times in this phase is of order 5 minutes, or 10\u22125 years. Consequently, time-steps\nshould be longer than this, and therefore Miller Bertolami et al. (2006) set the minimum time-step allowed in\ntheir calculations to this value. For some of our models in Table 5, however, we had to switch to even smaller\ntime-steps to achieve numerical convergence. Although this happened typically only for the very short period\naround the H-luminosity maximum, and for a duration of order 1 hour (e.g. for the model with initially 1.6 M\u2299\nand MT4 = 0.558 the time-step was 10\u22127 years for a total duration of 2.3 hrs), these models have to be taken\nwith care. The total born-again time for all of the cases shown is of the order of several hundred years, in\nagreement with Herwig (2001). In this paper it was also demonstrated that reducing the velocity of convective\nelements, shorter born-again times can be achieved, while Miller Bertolami et al. (2006) found born-again\ntimes of 5\u201310 years when going to the lower limit of acceptably small time-steps. While we in principle\nconfirm this model behaviour, we had to go to even lower time-steps for the whole evolution past the onset\nof the VLTP and therefore, as the referee correctly pointed out, such models should be considered as being\nunphysical.\n\n5. Discussion\nOur grid of stellar models evolving into, through, and past the Asymptotic Giant Branch phase covers a wide\nrange of metallicities, from Z = 0.0005 to Z = 0.04 and the two standard metal distributions, solar-scaled and\n\u03b1-enhanced. The physical input \u2013 equation of state, opacities, nuclear reaction rates \u2013 are completely up-todate. Both features are new for grids of AGB models. The masses followed the range from 1.0 to 6.0 M\u2299 . Our\ngrid should provide valuable input for population studies and for synthetic AGB models, although we have not\ndeveloped new analytical functions to represent key quantities, such as the core-mass \u2013 luminosity relation,\nor the interpulse times. Previous relations (Wagenhuber & Groenewegen 1998; Izzard et al. 2004) appear to\nbe good first-order approximations, which could be tuned to our models without large changes.\nWe specifically concentrated on a consistent treatment of carbon enrichment of the envelope due to the\nthird dredge-up. Carbon enrichment is taken into account in the opacities, which have been available not only\nfor various (X, Y, Z)-mixtures, but also for changes in the C/O-ratio. To this end new low-temperature molecular opacity tables were calculated and included in the stellar evolution program. The increase in carbon leads\nto lower effective temperature, mainly by the increase in total metallicity. We found that at same metallicity,\nan increase in C/O can initially lead to lower opacities and thus higher effective temperatures as compared to\na solar-scaled mixture. At C/O & 2 finally higher opacities are reached.\nFor the crucial mass loss of highly evolved AGB stars we used an empirical mass loss formula for oxygen\nstars (van Loon et al. 2005) and a theoretical one for carbon stars (Wachter et al. 2002). They are both similar\nin the order of magnitude of the mass loss and used only if the pulsation period is above 400 d. The switchingon of a strong mass loss from an (enhanced) Reimers wind happens quite suddenly at a pulsation period\nof 400 d, with a definite decrease in effective temperature. This is to be considered as a consequence of\nour specific mass loss description. Carbon-enhancement together with increasing opacities and decreasing\neffective temperature lead to a strong mass loss, which eventually terminates in a strong \"superwind\".\nThird dredge-up is obtained by assuming overshooting (implemented by a diffusion approach), the extent\nof which is set by the free parameter f of this prescription (Eq. 2). We used a numerical value of 0.016\n\n\f24\n\nA. Weiss and J.W. Ferguson: AGB model grid\n\nobtained from other, independent calibrations (open clusters, upper main-sequence). Although a very similar\nvalue has also been used in earlier AGB models (Herwig et al. 1999; Herwig 2000), specific comparison\nwith the results of nuclear processing indicate that it may vary within AGB stars: being possibly smaller in\nthe pulse-driven convection zone (Lugaro et al. 2003), and larger at the bottom of the convective envelope\n(Herwig et al. 2003). In spite of these hints we decided to refrain from varying the overshooting parameter.\nNevertheless, the result of the third dredge-up, obtained with this prescription and lifetimes for carbon-stars\nare in good agreement with observations. Such agreement has been reached before only with tunable synthetic\nmodels.\nOn the other hand, our predicted initial-final mass relation, though overall in very good agreement with\na recent empirical determination, shows that the hydrogen-free core grows less than observed for the lowest\ninitial stellar masses. This is due to our application of overshooting to all convective boundaries. A reduction\nof overshooting at the base of the pulse-driven convection zone seems to be supported.\nA severe problem \u2013 not specific to our calculations \u2013 are the convergence failures for highly evolved\nAGB stars. In particular for the higher masses and lower metallicities they partially prevent useful calculations. They are physically connected to a dominance of radiation pressure in the lower convective envelope\n(Wood & Faulkner 1986), which also leads to non-physical, super-sonic convective velocities (Wagenhuber\n1996) within the mixing-length theory. These convergence problems appear in many modern AGB calculations, such as Karakas (2003), which has been the most extensive and modern grid so far. A proper treatment,\nguided by hydrodynamical calculations, is urgently asked for. Since we did not use any of the \"recipes\" to\nsomehow bypass this critical phase, the number of reasonably complete AGB models is \u2248 100, out of the 110\nmodels our grid in total comprises. For the post-AGB phase, the number even reduces to 60, out of which only\n30 could be followed from the ZAMS to the WD stage without interruption. The remaining 30 cases were\nobtained by artificially stripping off the residual envelope in the early AGB-transition phase. All these cases\ncorrespond to an initial mass of up to 2 M\u2299 and a post-AGB mass below 0.60 M\u2299 . These models constitute a\nuseful extension of previous post-AGB models by Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) and Bloecker (1995a) to lower\npost-AGB masses.\nSince we aimed at treating the effect of carbon-enrichment of the envelope as consistently as possible,\nit is interesting to compare the effective temperatures of our models with those obtained with the synthetic\nmodels by Marigo & Girardi (2007), who had a similar fully consistent treatment of AGB evolution in mind,\nand calibrated their synthetic models to observed carbon-star luminosity functions. We specifically looked\ninto their model of 1.8 M\u2299 and Z = 0.008 (shown in Fig. 5 of that paper). In fact, the T eff evolution during\nthe AGB-phase is very similar: Both models start at log T eff \u2248 3.6 in the early interpulse phases and then\nbecome cooler down to log T eff \u2248 3.4 and below during the last TP. However, our model shows a more\ngradual decrease because of the better resolution of C/O-variations in the WSU molecular opacities. There\nare, of course, differences, as well. Our model experiences only 9 TPs (plus 1 estimated final TP), while theirs\nhas 32, with C/O > 1 reached at TP 19. The final C/O-ratio is close to 3. Our model ends at C/O= 2.004, and\nturns into a C-star after TP 4. This is due to the different dredge-up efficiencies and mass loss descriptions.\nA similar agreement is found for the M = 4 M\u2299 model, except that our model does not experience HBB\nand therefore the increase in T eff due to a decrease in C/O is not taking place. Before that event, during the\ninitial 3du, both models also show a similar T eff -development. Marigo & Girardi (2007) emphasize that their\nimproved treatment of molecular opacities leads to much better agreement with observed colors of AGB stars\n(Marigo et al. 2008). Together with the fact that our full AGB models are the first to reproduce the carbon-star\nlifetimes as derived by Girardi & Marigo (2007), we conclude that overall our full models agree well with\nthese calibrated and successful synthetic models, although they were computed with pre-defined physical\ninput.\nIn the present work, a detailed investigation of nucleosynthesis and chemical yields was ignored (see\nKarakas 2003, for such details). However, we can confirm that our models display the occurrence of 13 Cpockets as a consequence of 3du and convective mixing. Therefore, the necessary precondition for s-process\nnucleosynthesis is given, but a detailed analysis with a post-processing network is still needed.\nWe have used the most up-to-date and self-consistent physical approach to full AGB models. To our surprise, our models often agree better with the older Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) models than with the newer\nones by Karakas. These two sets were actually calculated with the same code, but in different versions, separated by a decade of development. We think that this indicates that the numerical and technical aspects of\nimplementing the relevant physics for AGB-stars is still an important factor, such that future work in this\ndirection is as important as further improvements in the physics itself.\nAcknowledgements.
