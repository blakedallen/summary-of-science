Introduction.\nBoth Charge Density Waves (CDW) and superconductors (SC) are the spin-singlet states, which are subject to\ndeparing under the Zeeman splitting effect of the magnetic field [1]. Above a certain critical field, the ground\nstate develops a periodic superstructure, see a short review and references in [2,3]. In superconductors it is\nknown as the FFLO state, which has attracted a great deal of attention recently - see e.g. [4,5], because of\nevents in organic and heavy-fermion superconductors, in cold atoms. Its formation is expected to be a very\nweek effect in conventional superconductors, unless it is endorsed by strong coupling \uf044~EF, or by open or\npartly flattened Fermi surfaces. Then the theories of early 80's (S.B. et al for CDWs, Buzdin et al, Machida et\nal for SCs) - see [2], predict formation of solitonic lattices with unpaired spins localized at midgap states near\nthe order parameter nodes. For CDWs there are convincing theoretical and experimental evidences [3] that\nbeyond the coherent walls, also the separate amplitude solitons (the walls building blocks) exist as quasi\nparticles - the spinons. These subgap particles are more favourable than electrons, and they would determine\nthe observable properties which are usually ascribed to conventional electronic over-gap excitations. At\npresence of 2D or 3D long range coherence, these topologically nontrivial solitons experience the confinement\nresulting in the spin-charge recombination. It originates the symmetry broken roton configuration for the phase\ncoupled with the spin-bearing kink in the core. Based upon the CDW notion, in SCs we expect to find a\ntightly bound pair of half-integer vortices sharing one unpaired spin. This state seems to win over its close\nalternative in 2D: a single pancake vortex with one half-filled intra-gap state.\n2. Observations of solitons.\nWe start to show most typical and convincing evidences for existence of the gap in the excitation spectrum of\nsinglet-ground-state electronic systems: superconductors and CDWs, Fig.1. Recall the standard BCS Bogolubov view on the nature of what is seen by tunneling and by other quasi-particles related experiments.\nStates are the linear combinations of: electrons and holes at \u00b1p for SC, or of electrons at \u2013p and p+2pf for\nCDWs. Corresponding spectra are E(k)= \u00b1(\u22062+(vfk)2)1/2, k=p-pf.\nBut is it always true? It is proved to be \"yes\" for typical SCs; but questionable for strong coupling cases:\nHigh-Tc, real space pairs, cold atoms, bi-polarons; clearly incomplete for CDWs as proved by modern\nexperiments; certainly inconsistent for 1D and even quasi 1D systems as proved theoretically, see [3]. These\nare the solitons and their arrays which are responsible for these confusions. Let us summarize a complex of\nwell established facts for the incommensurate CDWs (ICDW) which are symmetrically equivalent to SCs.\n\n\fThe CDW, at first sight, is a semiconductor with free electrons or holes near the gap edges \u00b1\uf020\uf044\uf030. Then the\nsame gap is expected to perform the following functions: 1. \uf044\uf030 - in kinetics and thermodynamics\n(conductivity, spin susceptibility, heat capacitance, NMR); 2. \uf044\uf030\uf020- in dynamics (photoemission, external\ntunneling; 3. 2\uf044\uf030 -in optics or in internal tunneling; 4. \uf044\uf030 \u2013 as a threshold for electronic pockets formation by\ndoping or injection (FET).\nBut nothing of this standard picture takes place in ICDWs: 1. Activation energies from transport in directions\non-chain and inter-chain differ by several times (TaS3 or Blue Bronze : 200K and 800K); 2. Activations for\nspins and from relaxation are in-between - 600K; 3. Optical absorption peaks at 2\uf044\uf030, but is deeply spread\nbelow; 4. Thresholds for charge transfer are as low as the on-chain activation, i.e. as the interchain decoupling\nscale Tc; 5. Charge injection is accommodated into the extended ground state via phase slip processes, rather\nthan via formation of Fermi pockets.\nThis decade, a true workshop on solitons was opened in organic conductors like (TMTCF)2X, see [7]. The\nfacility is provided by the discovery of the ferroelectricity endorsed by the charge ordering (Nad, Monceau,\nand S.B.; S. Brown et al). The zoo of solitons is largely accessed thanks to possibility of switching on/off of\nthe Mott state by means of the charge ordering. Here we recall only one example: optical evidences for\ncreation of solitons' pairs and their bound states Fig.2.\nWhile the charge ordering in the organic conductor is a crystal of electrons, the conventional CDW is a crystal\nof electron pairs. Its lowest energy current carrier may be the charge-2e defect of adding/missing one period at\nthe defected chain. It is the \u00b12\uf070 soliton of the ICDW order parameter \uf059ICDW= Acos(2Kfx+\u03c6), which has been\nrecently captured and visualized in STM experiments [8], Fig.3.\nWhat comes if the singlet pair of the CDW is broken into spin 1\u20442 components? Unlike the quotations related to\nthe Fig.1, it will not be an expectedly liberated electron-hole pair at \u00b1\u03940, but rather two spin carrying\n\"amplitude solitons\" \u2013 zeros of the order parameter distributed over the length \u03be0. The unpaired electron is\ntrapped at the midgap state of the amplitude soliton, with the energy \u22482\u22060/3, the total charge 0, and the spin 1\u20442.\nThis is the CDW realization of the spinon, in a similarity to the neutral kink in the polyacetylene. The regular\nlattice of these solitons might have been observed as the CDW superstructure in high magnetic field (HMF)\n[1] and in spin-Peierls systems in HMF (as clearly seen by the NMR [9]).\nGeneralization of the solitonic lattice from the ICDW to the SC is the FFLO phase in spin-polarized\nsuperconductors. Then the same AS is an elementary stripe fragment in both cases of the CDW and FFLO,\nwith a similarity [3] to holons in doped AFM insulator.\nCan we see the half-period AS as good as we could see the full-period phase soliton, Fig.3? Fortunately, there\nis an ill-noticed success for a dimerized system of a transition-metal-chalcogenide chain [10]. Commenting to\nthe STM picture reproduced in Fig.4, the authors claimed: \u00abFor the first time the spin soliton has been\nvisualized in real space\u00bb. While the solitons cannot be always visualized, they show themselves in spectral\nfeatures as in optics, Fig.2, or by tunneling as in Fig.5.\n3. Solitons and the long range order.\nThe major puzzle, as well as the inspiration, coming from the above quoted tunneling and STM experiments\nis that the amplitude solitons were observed within the low temperature (T<Tc) phase with the long range\norder. The hidden obstacle is the effect of the confinement appearing in higher dimensions D>1 [3].\nCommuting between degenerate minima on one chain would lead to a loss of the interchain ordering energy ~\n\"length to the next defect\". Other modes need to be activated to cure the topological defect.\nAt the 1D level, the Amplitude Soliton \uf059 (x=-\u221e) =-\uf059 (x=\u221e) performs the amplitude sign change A \uf0e0-A at\narbitrary \u03c6 =cnst. It is favorable in energy in comparison with an electron, but prohibited to be created\ndynamically even in 1D, and prohibited to exist even stationary at D>1. The resolution is to invoke the\n\n\fcombined symmetry: the amplitude kink A \uf0e0-A coupled with the half-integer \u03c6 \u2192\u03c6+\uf070 vortex of the phase\nrotation which compensates for the amplitude sign change. The resulting Spin-Roton complex allows for\nseveral interpretations. 2D view: a pair of \u03c0-vortices shares the common core bearing one unpaired spin which\nstabilizes the state. 3D view: ring of a half-flux vortex line, its center confines the spin. Today's perspective:\nnucleus of the melted FFLO phase in the spin-polarized SC.\nRecall finally an alternative microscopic insight to excitations in these spin-gap cases \u2013 SC or CDW. The\nstarting\nsingle\nchain\nlevel\nis\nwell\ndescribed\nby\nthe\nbosonisation\nlanguage.\n2\n2\nThe Hamiltonian \u03971D~(\u2202\u03b8) - Vcos(2\u03b8) +(\u2202\u03c6) is written in terms of the spin - \u03b8 and the charge - \u03c6 phases.\nThe energy V comes from the backward exchange scattering g1 of electrons. The pair-breaking excitation - the\ns=1/2 spinon, is the soliton connecting the degenerate minima of \u03971D : \u03b8\uf0e0 \u03b8+\u03c0. The singlet order parameter,\nfor either SC or CDW (depending on a definition of the charge phase \u03c6) is like \uf059SC,CDW~ cos\u03b8 exp(i \u03c6). Its\namplitude cos\u03b8 changes the sign across the allowed \u03c0 soliton, hence the spinon is an alternative description of\nthe same amplitude soliton which appears in BCS-Peierls type models.\n4. FFLO phase in superconductors.\nFFLO refers to an undulating phase in superconductors with an imbalanced spin population: In this\nabbreviation, FF and LO stand for Fulde&Ferrell 1964 and Larkin&Ovchinnikov 1964 articles. These authors\nchallenged the standard picture of a superconductor with a small spin polarization. The conventional\nhomogeneous phase implies filling the excess spins to quasi-particle states above the gap, according to the\nFig.6a copied from the original FF publication.\nModulated phases of the complex order parameter \uf059 with a wave number Q\u22600 have been suggested: FF:\n\uf059~exp(iQx), LO: \uf059~cos(Qx). The appropriately chosen vector Q (Fig.6b) erases mismatching at some (at all\nin the quasi-1D case) parts of the FS, hence preventing the collapse of the SC phase in the magnetic field.\nWhile this interpretation is valid for both suggestions FF and LO, there is a particular insight to the LO case\nrelevant to solitonic lattices. The planes of the order parameter zeros are able to concentrate the excess spins\nproviding the split intragap states which are able to accommodate unpaired electrons. This scenario is directly\nlinked to the solitonic lattices in quasi-1D case. The available exact solution for the FFLO phase in quasi 1D\nsystem is shown at the Fig.7.\n5. Inverse rout: from stripes to solitons and fractional vortices.\nIf the solitonic lattice melts, then in 1D each element becomes a particle \u2013 the amplitude soliton = spinon.\nIn D=2, the amplitude defect should be complemented by the pair of \uf070-vortices, Fig.8. This quasi 1D\nversion is a secure generalization of the rigorous 1D picture. But for how far can we extrapolate to general\nsuperconductors which do not possess a strong anisotropy? In general, the cost of creating a pair of vortices\nis ~EphLog(L), where Eph is a characteristic energy of phase deformations and the string length L is the\ndistance (in lattice units) between the opposite \uf070-vortices. This loss must be equilibrated by the gain -\uf044'L\nfor the string formation, where \uf044'~\uf044 is the energy gained from accommodating unpaired electrons to the\nmidgap states. In the quasi 1D case, Eph~Tc<\uf044 is given by the low phase ordering temperature Tc, then the\ntotal energy EphLog(L) -\uf044'L/a keeps to be negative down to smallest atomic length L~a \u2013 this is why the\ncombined kink-roton complex is certainly a stable quasi-particle. But for isotropic SCs, Eph~EF which\nallows for only a large scale complex, at L/a> EF/\uf044'. The strong coupling limit \uf044~EF is necessary, which\nleaves this scenario for a bipolaronic SC or for a condensate of paired cold Fermi atoms.\nIn absence of a microscopic theory for strong coupling vortices (i.e. with only a single pair of intra-gap\nstates), we can rely upon existing [12] numeric modeling (still done within the BCS scheme). And the\n\n\fresults are supporting indeed: at presence of unpaired spins, the usual integer 2\uf070 vortex, created by rotation\n(magnetic field), splits into two \uf070- vortices, Fig. 9.\nThe energetics behind the vortex splitting is understandable: for any 2\u03c0N vortex, the energy ~N2 hence 1\u20442\nof it can be gained by splitting in 2 vortices with vorticities \u03c0N \u2013 this is why there is no such a thing as 4\u03c0,\netc. vortex. But splitting of N=1 vortex into two 1\u20442 ones is commonly prohibited because there is no selfmapping at noninteger N. It becomes allowed if the amplitude domain wall opens between the split cores.\nThe node in order parameter amplitude allows for the \"prohibited\" N=1/2 circulation, hence forming a pair\nof two 1\u20442 vortices connected by the spin-carrying amplitude domain wall .\nAt first sight, there is a simper construction \u2013 a competitor to the scenario of the kink-roton complex. This\nis a single integer vortex with a half-filled intra-gap core level \u2013 an extension of the Caroli-DeGennesMatricon staircase to the smallest (two) number of levels. But it does not seem to work: unlike the zerolevel midgap states originated by the amplitude kink, the vortex core levels are split and repelled (with\nincreasing coupling) towards the gap edges; so the energy gain from the localization of one unpaired\nelectron is expected to be small as \uf044'~\uf04402/EF.\n6. Conclusions.\nExistence of solitons is proved experimentally in single- or bi-electronic processes of CDWs in several\nquasi 1D materials. They feature self-trapping of electrons into mid-gap states and separation of spin and\ncharge into spinons and holons, sometimes with their reconfinement at essentially different scales.\nContinuously broken symmetries allow for solitons entering the D>1 world of long range ordered states:\nSC, ICDW, SDW. Solitons take forms of amplitude kinks which are topologically bound to semi-vortices\nof gapless modes \u2013 half integer rotons. These combined particles substitute for electrons - certainly in\nquasi-1D systems, which is valid for both charge-and spin-gaped cases. The description is extrapolatable to\nstrongly correlated isotropic cases. Here it meets the picture of fragmented FFLO or stripe phases.\nAcknowledgements.\nA support was provided by the ANR program (the project BLAN07-3-192276).\nThis article summarizes the presentations given at the conferences STRIPES 2008 and ECRYS 2008 [13].\nReferences\n[1] Springer Series in Mat.
