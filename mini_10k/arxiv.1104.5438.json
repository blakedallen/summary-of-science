Introduction and summary\nFrom the worldsheet point of view, perturbative superstring theory is based\non N = 2 supersymmetric conformal field theories (CFTs) in two dimensions.\nAmong the central relations of this approach is that string amplitudes are obtained from CFT correlators via integration over the moduli space M of worldsheets, i. e. Riemann surfaces with boundaries and field insertions, see e. g. [15, 21].\nWe summarise this relation as the heuristic identity\nZ\n. . . string =\n. . . CFT .\n(1.1)\nM\n\nThe complete and rigorous treatment of string theory only in terms of CFT is a\ndifficult and not fully solved problem. However, if we restrict to the sector of chiral primary fields [49] in N = 2 CFTs, the situation is much better understood.\nChiral primaries are known to be equivalently described by the BRST cohomology of the topological twist of the associated N = 2 CFT, see e. g. [66, 67].\nThis construction is also the most important source of examples of open/closed\n\n2\n\n\ftopological field theories (TFTs) [5, 46, 54] which axiomatise properties of the\npath integral and have a simple and concise algebraic formulation in terms of\nFrobenius algebras.\nThe part of full string theory which is built solely on the structure of a topological conformal field theory (and not a full CFT) is called topological string\ntheory. If we restrict to its tree-level boundary sector then one can rewrite the\nright-hand side of (1.1) as\nZ\nZ\nE\nD\n(1)\n(1)\n(1.2)\nWi1 ...in \u223c \u03c8i1 \u03c8i2 \u03c8i3 P \u03c8i4 . . . \u03c8in\ndisk\n\nin terms ofR chiral primaries \u03c8i inserted on the boundary and their integrated de(1)\nscendants \u03c8i . A thorough study of BRST symmetry and other Ward identities\nshows that these topological string amplitudes are subject to certain algebraic\nconstraints. As shown e. g. in [27], these relations precisely encode the structure\nof a Calabi-Yau A\u221e -algebra on the open string state spaces.1\nWe may summarise this result together with the alternative approach via the\nfunctorial definition of open topological conformal field theory in [12] as follows:\nin its complete algebraic formulation, the transition from mere open topological\nfield theory to open topological string theory is the passage from Frobenius algebras to Calabi-Yau A\u221e -algebras. We thus view the study of such A\u221e -structures\nas a first-principle approach to open topological string theory.\nOne of the immediate and more concrete consequences of a description of topological string amplitudes Wi1 ...in via an explicit construction of the A\u221e -structure\nis the exact computation of a quantity from full string theory. This is the D-brane\nsuperpotential Weff of the associated four-dimensional effective field theory,\nWeff (u) =\n\nX1\nWi ...i ui . . . uin ,\nn 1 n 1\nn>3\n\nwhere ui are the boundary moduli.\nAnother important yet non-constructive result of [27] is that bulk deformations\nof open topological string theories are described (before tadpole-cancellation) by\ncurved A\u221e -algebras. On the level of amplitudes, bulk deformations are perturbations of the boundary amplitudes (1.2) by bulk chiral primary fields \u03c6j and\nR (2)\ntheir integrated descendant \u03c6j :\nZ\nZ\nD\nR (2) E\nP\n(1)\n(1)\nWi1 ...in 7\u2212\u2192 Wi1 ...in (t) \u223c \u03c8i1 \u03c8i2 \u03c8i3 P \u03c8i4 . . . \u03c8in e j tj \u03c6j\n.\ndisk\n\nIt is worth stressing that here the general case of perturbations by all chiral\nprimaries \u03c6j (and not only marginal fields) is considered.\n1\n\nWe shall recall the definitions and their relation to topological string amplitudes Wi1 ...in in\nsubsection 2.1.\n\n3\n\n\fThe appearance of curved A\u221e -algebras is the main reason for the previous lack\nof first-principle constructions of bulk-deformed open topological string theories,\nsince the theory of curved A\u221e -algebras is considerably more complicated and less\ndeveloped than the non-curved case. Again, if such a construction is successful,\nit also effortlessly affords the computation of the bulk moduli dependent effective\nsuperpotential\nX1\nWi1 ...in (t) ui1 . . . uin .\nWeff (u, t) =\nn\nn>1\n\nAlternative approaches to the computation of Weff (u, t) in the case of sigma\nmodels with compact targets include those in [1\u20133, 6, 7, 17, 20, 23, 24, 29, 38,\n43, 55, 65]. Their successful application usually depends on special properties\nof the geometry involved, while the A\u221e -approach is always applicable (though\nnot always most efficient in computations). Conversely, the general approach via\nA\u221e -algebras can also be applied to non-compact targets as in [4, 10].\nIn the present paper we propose a method based on A\u221e -theory to construct\nbulk-deformed open topological string theories from Landau-Ginzburg models,2\nand we also provide some tools that can be applied in even more general theories.\nOur motivation to study Landau-Ginzburg models is at least twofold. On the\none hand, their description as open TFTs via matrix factorisations is comparably\nsimple so that conceptual problems can be addressed unfettered by unnecessary\ncomplications. Another motivation has its root in the ultimate goal to understand full string theory rigorously and conceptually from the worldsheet perspective. Among the best-understood classes of CFTs are the so-called rational ones,\nfor which the representation theory of the underlying vertex operator algebra is\nunder comparably good control. However, one may argue that rational CFTs\nare only \"rather well inspected lampposts\" [16], and there is need for a better\ngrasp on more general theories. A potent tool are Landau-Ginzburg models and\ntheir orbifolds, whose infrared fixed points under renormalisation group flow are\nbelieved [28, 37, 51, 64] to cover a huge class of N = 2 CFTs. One of the\nmain merits of this conjectured CFT/LG correspondence is the observation that\nLandau-Ginzburg models discriminate much less against the presence or lack of\nrational symmetry, and hence they may serve as a guiding light away from the\nlamppost of rational CFTs.\nIn the remainder of this introduction we shall give an outline of the main ideas\nand results of the present paper. The relevant technical background and notions\nwe use will be carefully introduced in section 2, and section 3 together with the\nappendix contains the details of our construction.\nWe first recall that the on-shell A\u221e -structure encoding open string amplitudes\nalways originates from an off-shell, string field theoretic description. The latter\n2\n\nNote that the Landau-Ginzburg models we consider do not necessarily have to correspond\nto critical string theories.\n\n4\n\n\fis encoded in an off-shell state space A together with the BRST differential and\nthe operator product expansion. They give A the structure of a differential\ngraded algebra (which is a special case of an A\u221e -algebra) that we will denote\ne where H is the\n(A, \u2202). Similarly, the correct on-shell A\u221e -structure is (H, \u2202)\nBRST cohomology and \u2202e is a short-hand notation for all higher A\u221e -products.\ne is explicitly constructed from (A, \u2202) as its so-called minimal model (see\n(H, \u2202)\nproposition 2.2 and the discussion in subsection 2.2.2). Note that the terminology\n\"on-shell\" (for BRST cohomology H) and \"off-shell\" (for the space A which also\nincludes non-closed states) that we use throughout the paper is different from the\none used in the literature on the computation of Weff by geometrical methods.\nIn the latter context \"on-shell\" means that the moduli are chosen such that the\nF-term equations \u2202Weff = 0 (which are identical to the Maurer-Cartan equation\nof the open string A\u221e -algebra) are satisfied, and our notion of \"off-shell\" does\nnot play a role. It is, however, the crucial string field theoretic setting from which\nour approach originates.\nIn the case of affine Landau-Ginzburg models with potential W , the open string\ne are described in terms of matrix factorisations of W .\nalgebras (A, \u2202) and (H, \u2202)\nTo study bulk deformations of this open topological string theory, we also need\nto know the on-shell and off-shell descriptions of the bulk sector. They are given\nby the Jacobi ring Jac(W ) and the space Tpoly of polyvector fields, respectively.\nIt is a general fact that bulk sectors of topological string theories have an L\u221e structure, see e. g. [31, 32, 68, 69]. For Landau-Ginzburg models this is under\ngood control as we review in subsection 2.2.\nTo make the connection between the bulk sector and the deformations it ine more transparent, we must\nduces on the open string algebras (A, \u2202) and (H, \u2202)\nexplain the latter's condensed notation in some more detail. (For a more complete\ndiscussion we refer to subsection 2.1.) Technically we describe the A\u221e -structures\non A and H by nilpotent coderivations \u2202 and \u2202e on certain spaces TA and TH , ree of coderivations\nspectively. Furthermore, the spaces Coder(A, \u2202) and Coder(H, \u2202)\non TA and TH naturally have the structure of L\u221e -algebras. It turns out that the\nproblem of deforming (A, \u2202), i. e. finding operators \u03b4 such that (A, \u2202 +\u03b4) is still an\nA\u221e -algebra, is equivalent to solving the Maurer-Cartan equation for Coder(A, \u2202)\n(and a similar statement is true for H). A general important property is that\nsolution spaces of Maurer-Cartan equations (up to gauge transformations) for\nquasi-isomorphic L\u221e -algebras are in bijection, see proposition 2.3.\nWe are now in a position to present our strategy to construct all bulk deformations of the Landau-Ginzburg open topological string theory described by\ne This strategy divides into two main steps. The first step classifies all de(H, \u2202).\nformations of the off-shell algebra (A, \u2202), while the second step transports these\ne These are our main results, and\ndeformations to the on-shell algebra (H, \u2202).\nthey are the content of theorems 3.1 and 3.8, respectively. Our construction is\n\n5\n\n\fthe natural stringy bulk-boundary map that provides the bulk-deformed open\ntopological string amplitudes before tadpole-cancellation, as in [27].\nTo take the first step we will construct an L\u221e -quasi-isomorphism\nTpoly \u2212\u2192 Coder(A, \u2202)\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhich links the off-shell bulk space Tpoly with the coderivations governing deformations of the off-shell open string algebra (A, \u2202). It will be easy to see that\nthe solutions of the Maurer-Cartan equation for Tpoly are precisely given by the\non-shell bulk space Jac(W ), and since (1.3) is a quasi-isomorphism we thus know\nthat all deformations of (A, \u2202) come from (on-shell) bulk fields. Furthermore,\nas an aside from the main subject of the paper, we will also sketch a construction of an off-shell enhancement of the Kapustin-Li pairing [26, 34] that appears\nnaturally in the context of our first step.\nTo construct the map (1.3) in subsection 3.1, we first translate the problem\nof deforming the differential graded algebra (A, \u2202) into that of a curved algebra (A, \u2202 \u2032 ) (with its curvature originating from the potential W ) by finding an\nisomorphism Coder(A, \u2202) \u223c\n= Coder(A, \u2202 \u2032 ). Then we observe that the L\u221e -quasiisomorphism\nTpoly \u2212\u2192 Coder(A, \u2202 \u2032 )\nis known in the special commutative case in which also both the curvature in \u2202 \u2032\nand the potential W (as part of the L\u221e -structure of Tpoly ) vanish. To wit, this case\nis precisely the construction of Kontsevich's deformation quantisation [11, 40, 62].\nWith this deep result as a given, we show how to generalise it to our case of\ninterest, thus completing our first main step in the proof of theorem 3.1. Since\ncurved A\u221e -algebras are sometimes also called weak, we refer to this construction\nas \"weak deformation quantisation\".\nIn the second step we have to understand how the bulk deformations (A, \u2202 + \u03b4)\ne To this\nof the off-shell algebra are passed down to the on-shell algebra (H, \u2202).\neffect we note that the method of the homological perturbation lemma [13, 25] can\nbe employed in our setting. As is explained together with the rest of our second\nstep in subsection 3.2, under certain conditions the homological perturbation\nlemma allows to transport deformations of one complex to another one. We\ne and\nshow that these conditions are met for the complexes (TA , \u2202) and (TH , \u2202),\ne\ne\nwe thus obtain an on-shell deformation \u2202 + \u03b4 from \u2202 + \u03b4. We emphasise that this\nconstruction is entirely explicit and works for arbitrary A\u221e -algebras.\nFrom the homological perturbation lemma alone one however cannot decide\ne \u2208 End(TH ) actually is a coderivation and thus really\nwhether or not (\u2202e + \u03b4)\nencodes an A\u221e -structure. Yet by reformulating homological perturbation in coherent L\u221e -language (proposition 3.5) we construct another L\u221e -morphism\ne\nCoder(A, \u2202) \u2212\u2192 Coder(H, \u2202)\n6\n\n\fand thus find that our deformations \u2202e + \u03b4e are indeed coderivations (proposition 3.6). In this way we construct all bulk-induced deformations of LandauGinzburg open topological string theories from first principles.\n\n2. Review of the relevant notions and results\nIn this section we first introduce basic notions and results from the theory of\nA\u221e - and L\u221e -algebras. Then we review B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg models by\nrecalling how they are known to be endowed with the structures of topological\nfield theory and open topological string theory.\n\n2.1. A\u221e - and L\u221e -algebras\nA curved A\u221e -algebra is a (Z- or Z2 -) graded vector space3 A =\nwith a codifferential \u2202 of degree +1 on the tensor coalgebra\nM\nTA =\nA[1]\u2297n .\n\nL\n\ni\n\nAi together\n\nn>0\n\nTo unwrap this definition we first recall that the suspended vector space A[1] has\nhomogeneous components A[1]i = Ai+1 , and that the standard comultiplication\n\u2206 : TA \u2192 TA \u2297 TA is given by\n\u2206(a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) =\n\nn\nX\n\n(a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 aj ) \u2297 (aj+1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) .\n\nj=0\n\nFurthermore, a coderivation \u2202 \u2208 Coder(TA ) is a linear operator on TA that satisfies the dual version of the product rule,\n\u2206 \u25e6 \u2202 = (\u2202 \u2297 idTA + idTA \u2297 \u2202) \u25e6 \u2206 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nand a codifferential is a coderivation that squares to zero,\n\u22022 = 0 .\nIf we decompose the codifferential as\nX\nn\nn\n\u2202=\n\u2202m\nwhere \u2202m\n\u2208 Hom(A[1]\u2297m , A[1]\u2297n ) ,\nm,n>0\n\nthen the maps\nrn = \u2202n1 : A[1]\u2297n \u2212\u2192 A[1]\n3\n\nWe always work over the field C.\n\n7\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fare fundamental since it follows from (2.1) that all the other components of \u2202\ncan be expressed in term of them:\nn\n\u2202m\n=\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u2297(n\u2212j\u22121)\n\n1\nid\u2297j\nA[1] \u2297 \u2202m\u2212n+1 \u2297 idA[1]\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nj=0\n\nThus the A\u221e -structure encoded in \u2202 is equivalently described by the maps rm ,\nfor which the condition (2.2) translates into the bilinear constraints\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n\u2297(n\u2212i\u2212j)\nrn\u2212j+1 \u25e6 id\u2297i\n\u2297\nr\n\u2297\nid\n=0\n(2.4)\nj\nA[1]\nA[1]\ni,j>0, i+j6n\n\nfor all n > 0. We write \u2202n forPthe codifferential determined solely by rn , and we\nhave the decomposition \u2202 = n>0 \u2202n .\nA curved A\u221e -algebra (A, rn ) is said to be cyclic with respect to a pairing\nh * , * i : A \u2297 A \u2192 C if\nha0 , rn (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an )i = (\u22121)ea0 (ea1 +...+ean ) han , rn (a2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an \u2297 a0 )i\nfor all n > 0 and all homogeneous ai , where we write e\na for the degree of a \u2208 A[1].\n(A, rn ) is unital if there exists an element e \u2208 A0 such that r2 (e \u2297 a) = \u2212a,\nr2 (a \u2297 e) = (\u22121)ea a for all homogeneous a \u2208 A[1], and all other products rn\nvanish if applied to a tensor product involving e.\nA curved A\u221e -algebra (A, rn ) is called a strong A\u221e -algebra (or simply an A\u221e algebra) if its curvature r0 : C \u2192 A[1] vanishes. In this case (2.4) implies that r1\nis a differential, and (A, rn ) is called minimal if r1 = 0. A minimal A\u221e -algebra\n(A, rn ) that is unital and cyclic with respect to a non-degenerate pairing is called\nCalabi-Yau.\nRemark 2.1. Calabi-Yau A\u221e -algebras appear in open topological string theory\nin the following way. Let H be the space of open string operators of the underlying\nTFT, and let {\u03c8i } be a basis. H is equipped with a non-degenerate pairing which\nis the two-point-correlator h * , * idisk. By the results of [12, 27], there exists a\nminimal and unital A\u221e -structure (H, ren ) that is cyclic with respect to h * , * idisk,\nand the open string amplitudes Wi1 ...in introduced in (1.2) are encoded in this\nA\u221e -structure via the identity\nWi1 ...in = h\u03c8i1 , ren\u22121 (\u03c8i2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c8in )idisk .\n\nThe maps ren can be explicitly constructed using the minimal model theorem, see\nproposition 2.2 and the discussion in subsection 2.2.2 below.\n\nAnother special case of a curved A\u221e -algebra which is of particular interest is\nthe one whose higher maps rn for n > 3 are all zero, and it is called a curved\ndifferential graded (DG) algebra. If we define\nC = r0 (1) ,\n\na * b = (\u22121)ea r2 (a \u2297 b)\n\nd = r1 ,\n\n8\n\n\fthen in this case the constraints (2.4) become\nd(C) = 0\n\nd2 (a) = a * C \u2212 C * a ,\n\nd(a * b) = d(a) * b + (\u22121)|a| a * d(b) ,\n\n(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\n\nfor all homogeneous a, b, c \u2208 A, and the signs involving the degree |a| = e\na+1\nof a \u2208 A arise from the Koszul rule. If the curvature C vanishes we have a DG\nalgebra, and if both C and d vanish we are left with a graded associative algebra.\nA\u221e -algebras are generalisations of DG (associative) algebras where the higher\nmaps and their constraints measure to what extent associativity only holds up to\nhomotopy. Similarly, L\u221e -algebras are generalisations of DG Lie algebras whose\nhigher maps measure how much the Jacobi identity is violated.\nTo give the precise definition let us consider a graded vector space V and\ndenote by SV the space TV divided by the ideal generated by elements of the\nform u \u2297 v \u2212 (\u22121)|u| |v| v \u2297 u for homogeneous u, v \u2208 V . If we write v1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 vn\nfor the element represented by v1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 vn in the quotient space SV , then the\ncoproduct on SV is given by\nv1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 vn 7\u2212\u2192\n\nn\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03b5\u03c3;v1 ,...,vn (v\u03c3(1) \u2227 . . . \u2227 v\u03c3(j) ) \u2297 (v\u03c3(j+1) \u2227 . . . \u2227 v\u03c3(n) )\n\nj=0 \u03c3\u2208Sh(j,n)\n\nwhere Sh(j, n) is the set of permutations \u03c3 of n elements that satisfy \u03c3(1) <\n. . . < \u03c3(j) and \u03c3(j + 1) < . . . < \u03c3(n), and the sign \u03b5\u03c3;v1 ,...,vn is defined via\nv\u03c3(1) \u2227 . . . \u2227 v\u03c3(n) = \u03b5\u03c3;v1 ,...,vn v1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 vn .\nWith this preparation a curved L\u221e -algebra is a graded vector space V together\nwith a codifferential d of degree +1 on SV . Again, the fact that d is a coderivation allows us to equivalently consider a family of maps ln : V [1]\u2227n \u2192 V [1]\nwith constraints coming from the condition d2 = 0. For more details we refer\ne. g. to [41, 44].\nIn the present paper we will only be concerned with the special case of a DG\nLie algebra where the maps l0 and ln for n > 3 all vanish. If we write\nd = l1 ,\n\n[u, v] = (\u22121)uel2 (u \u2227 v)\n\n(2.5)\n\nthen the defining conditions read\n[u, v] = (\u22121)|u| |v| [v, u] ,\n\nd([u, v]) = [d(u), v] + (\u22121)|u| [u, d(v)] ,\n\n(\u22121)|u| |w|[u, [v, w]] + (\u22121)|u| |v| [v, [w, u]] + (\u22121)|v| |w| [w, [u, v]] = 0 .\nGiven two curved A\u221e -algebras (A, \u2202) and (A\u2032 , \u2202 \u2032 ), a (weak) A\u221e -morphism\nbetween them is a morphism F \u2208 Hom(TA , TA\u2032 ) of degree 0 between the associated\ncodifferential coalgebras, i. e.\n\u2206 \u25e6 F = (F \u2297 F ) \u25e6 \u2206 ,\n\n9\n\nF \u25e6 \u2202 = \u2202\u2032 \u25e6 F .\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fIf we decompose\nX\nF =\nFmn\n\nwhere F00 = 1 ,\n\nFmn \u2208 Hom(A[1]\u2297m , A\u2032 [1]\u2297n )\n\nm,n>0\n\nthen the first equation in (2.6) implies that\nX\nFmn =\nFj11 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Fj1n\nj1 +...+jn =m\n\ncan be expressed in terms of the maps Fn = Fn1 . We call F a weak\nA\u221e -isomorphism if F1 is an isomorphism of vector spaces. A weak A\u221e morphism F between strong A\u221e -algebras (A, rn ) and (A\u2032 , rn\u2032 ) is called an A\u221e quasi-isomorphism if F1 induces a vector space isomorphism between the cohomologies of r1 and r1\u2032 , and it is called a (strong) A\u221e -morphism if Fmn = 0 whenever\nn > m.\nAnalogous definitions hold for weak L\u221e -morphisms which are morphisms between codifferential coalgebras SV and SV \u2032 (again, see e. g. [41, 44] for details).\nThe general theory of non-curved A\u221e - and L\u221e -algebras is developed considerably further than that of the curved case (see, however, [57, 60]). In particular,\nthe central minimal model theorem [30, 52] that we review next has no known\ncounterpart in the curved case. It will suffice to discuss only A\u221e -algebras.\nThe content of the minimal model theorem is that every A\u221e -algebra (A, rn )\nis related to an A\u221e -structure (H = Hr1 (A), ren ) on r1 -cohomology via an A\u221e quasi-isomorphism F : (H, ren ) \u2192 (A, rn ). Furthermore, up to A\u221e -isomorphisms\n(H, ren ) is the unique minimal A\u221e -algebra that is A\u221e -quasi-isomorphic to (A, rn ).\nTo obtain explicit expressions for the maps ren and Fn we first choose a vector\nspace decomposition\nA=H \u2295B\u2295L\n(2.7)\nwhere B = Im(r1 ) and L is the complement of Ker(r1 ). It follows that H gives a\nchoice of representatives of elements in Hr1 (A), and in this sense we identify these\ntwo spaces. In particular the choice of decomposition amounts to a choice of a\nhomotopy on A, i. e. a map G : A \u2192 A with r1 G + Gr1 = idA[1] \u2212 \u03c0H and G2 = 0,\nwhere \u03c0H : A \u2192 H denotes the projection onto H. We also have projections\n\u03c0B = r1 \u25e6 G and \u03c0L = G \u25e6 r1 . With this setup, the A\u221e -structure on H and the\nassociated quasi-isomorphism are given by the following proposition.\nProposition 2.2. Let (A, \u2202) be a strong A\u221e -algebra with r1 -cohomology H.\nThere is a unique coalgebra morphism F \u2208 Hom(TH , TA ) and a unique minimal\nA\u221e -structure \u2202e \u2208 Coder(TH ) that satisfy the equations\n\u2202F = F \u2202e ,\n\u2202e11 = 0 ,\n\n(2.8)\n\n10\n\n\fF11 = \u03b9H : H[1] \u0592\u2192 A[1] ,\nn\nX\n\u2202k1 Fnk .\nFn1 = \u2212G\n\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nk=2\n\nProof. First we will show that the condition that F be an A\u221e -morphism follows\nfrom the conditions above, then we show that \u2202e is indeed a codifferential. Since\nF is a coalgebra morphism, (2.8) reduces to\n\u220211 Fn1\n\n+\n\nn\nX\n\n\u2202l1 Fnl\n\n=\n\nn\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\nl=2\n\nFk1 \u2202enk\n\nfor all n > 1. We rewrite the above set of equations by splitting them into three\nparts:\n\u03c0H\n\nn\n\u0010X\n\n\u0010\n\u03c0B \u220211 Fn1 +\n\n\u03c0L\n\nn\n\u0010X\n\n\u2202l1 Fnl \u2212\n\nl=2\n\nl=2\nn\nX\n\nl=2\nn\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2202l1 Fnl\n\n\u0011\n\n= \u2202en1 ,\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u0011\n\u2202l1 Fnl = 0 ,\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u0011\nFk1 \u2202enk = 0 .\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe first immediate observation is that \u2202e is uniquely determined by (2.11). Equation (2.12) follows by employing (2.10) and (2.9), and to show (2.13) we compute\n\u03c0L\n\nn\n\u0010X\n\n\u2202l1 Fnl\n\n\u2212\n\nl=2\n\nn\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\nFk1 \u2202enk\n\n\u0011\n\n= \u03c0L\n\nn\n\u0010X\n\n\u2202l1 Fnl\n\n+G\n\nk=2 r=2\n\nl=2\n\n= \u03c0L\n\nn\n\u0010X\n\nn\u22121 X\nk\nX\n\n\u2202l1 Fnl\n\n+G\n\nn\u22121 X\nk\nX\nk=2 r=2\n\nl=2\n\n\u2202r1 Fkr \u2202enk\n\n\u2202r1 \u2202kr Fnk\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n= 0.\n\nIn the first step we used (2.10), the second step is the induction step which allows\nus to commute \u2202e through F , and in the last step we used \u2202 2 = 0.\nTo show that \u2202e2 = 0 we note that\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2202ek1 \u2202enk =\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n\u03c0H\n\nk\n\u0010X\nl=2\n\nk\nn\n\u0011\n\u0010X\n\u0011 X\n\u2202l1 \u2202kl Fnk = 0 .\n\u03c0H\n\u2202l1 Fkl \u2202enk =\nk=1\n\nl=2\n\nIn this paper we are concerned with the question of how to construct bulk\ndeformations of an open topological string theory that we describe as an A\u221e algebra. More generally, a deformation of a (strong) A\u221e -algebra (A, \u2202) is an\n\n11\n\n\foperator \u03b4 \u2208 End(TA ) such that (A, \u2202 + \u03b4) is a curved A\u221e -algebra. We see that \u03b4\nmust be a coderivation of degree +1, and the condition (\u2202 + \u03b4)2 = 0 becomes\n[\u2202, \u03b4] +\n\n1\n[\u03b4, \u03b4] = 0 ,\n2\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere [ * , * ] denotes the graded commutator. This is the Maurer-Cartan equation for the DG Lie algebra Coder(TA ) with differential [\u2202, * ] and bracket\n[ * , * ]. Thus solving the Maurer-Cartan equation for the special L\u221e -algebra\n(Coder(TA ), [\u2202, * ], [ * , * ]) is equivalent to solving the deformation problem for\nthe A\u221e -algebra (A, \u2202).4\nFor an arbitrary L\u221e -algebra (V, ln ) its Maurer-Cartan equation reads\nX 1\nln (\u03b4 \u2227n ) = 0 ,\nn!\nn>1\nand we denote by MC(V, ln ) its space of formal power series solutions \u03b4 \u2208 V1\nmodulo the action of the group generated by gauge transformations\nX\n1\n\u03b4 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b4 +\nln (\u03c6 \u2227 \u03b4 \u2227(n\u22121) )\n(n\n\u2212\n1)!\nn>1\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 V0 .\nIn the case of the deformation problem (2.14), gauge transformations lead to\nisomorphic A\u221e -structures (A, \u2202) \u223c\n= (A, \u2202 + \u03b4). Thus\nMC(Coder(TA ), [\u2202, * ], [ * , * ])\nis the space we wish to determine, for which the following important result of [40,\n53] will prove useful in the next section.\nProposition 2.3. Let F : (V, ln ) \u2192 (V \u2032 , l\u2032n ) be an L\u221e -morphism. Then\n\u03b4 7\u2212\u2192\n\nX 1\nFn (\u03b4 \u2227n )\nn!\nn>1\n\n(2.15)\n\nmaps elements in MC(V, ln ) to elements in MC(V \u2032 , l\u2032n ). Furthermore, if F is an\nL\u221e -quasi-isomorphism, then (2.15) is an isomorphism.\nProof. Denote by d the coderivation determined by the higher maps ln . Consider\na weak coalgebra morphism M \u2208 End(SV ) with the properties M01 = \u03b4 and\nM11 = idV [1] , where \u03b4 is a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation for d. Then we\nhave M0n = n!1 \u03b4 \u2227n and the Maurer-Cartan equation for d can be rewritten as\n(dM)10 = 0 .\n4\n\nNote that we slightly abuse notation here and below as the bracket [ * , * ] and the map l2 are\nonly equal up to a sign, see equation (2.5).\n\n12\n\n\fNow let d\u2032 denote the coderivation corresponding to the products l\u2032n . We have\nX\nFk1 (dM)k0 = 0\n(d\u2032 F M)10 = (F dM)10 =\nk>1\n\nwhere the last equation follows from the fact that (dM)k0 is uniquely determined\nby (dM)10 . We have thus shown that \u03b4 \u2032 = (F M)10 solves the Maurer-Cartan\nequation for d\u2032 . In expanded form this reads\n\u03b4\u2032 =\n\nX\n\nFn1 M0n =\n\nn>1\n\nX 1\nFn1 (\u03b4 \u2227n ) .\nn!\nn>1\n\nIf F is a quasi-isomorphism, then it is an isomorphism between the spaces of\nfirst order deformations, and as it admits homotopy inverses, this isomorphism\nextends to all orders.\nWe also observe that solving (2.14) up to gauge transformations only to first\norder is the same as computing the cohomology\nHH\u2022 (A, \u2202) = H[\u2202, * ] (Coder(TA ))\nof the Hochschild cochain complex (Coder(TA ), [\u2202, * ]). In this sense Hochschild\ncohomology HH\u2022 (A, \u2202) classifies deformations of (A, \u2202).\nRemark 2.4. There is an important subtlety in the definition of the Hochschild\ncochain complex. As we saw in our discussion of equation (2.3), coderivations\nof TA are isomorphic to collections of multilinear maps. However, one may either consider finitely or infinitely many multilinear maps, so there are actually\nHochschild cochain complexes of the first kind and of the second kind,5\nY\nHom(A[1]\u2297n , A[1]) ,\nCoder(TA )I \u223c\n=\nn>0\n\nCoder(TA ) \u223c\n=\nII\n\nM\n\nHom(A[1]\u2297n , A[1]) .\n\nn>0\n\nBoth complexes are endowed with the same differential [\u2202, * ], but they have different invariance properties: Hochschild cohomology of the first kind is invariant\nunder (strong) A\u221e -quasi-isomorphisms [45], while Hochschild cohomology of the\nsecond kind is invariant under weak A\u221e -isomorphisms [58].\nAs follows from the discussion of the next section it is Hochschild cohomology\nof the second kind that describes all bulk deformations. On the other hand,\nHochschild cohomology of the first kind cannot always capture all bulk fields, in\nfact for certain branes it actually vanishes. Thus we simply write HH\u2022 (A, \u2202) for\nHochschild cohomology of the second kind in this paper.\n5\n\nThere is a much deeper origin of the two different kinds of Hochschild complexes, see [58, 60]\n\n13\n\n\f2.2. B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg models\n2.2.1. Open/closed topological field theory\nWe begin our discussion of B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg models by recalling that\nthey give examples of full open/closed topological field theories in the sense of [46,\n54]. The on-shell bulk sector [63] of such a model with affine target space X = CN\nand potential W \u2208 R = C[x1 , . . . , xN ] is given by the Jacobian6\nJac(W ) = R/(\u2202x1 W, . . . , \u2202xN W ) .\n\n(2.16)\n\nThis is the cohomology of the off-shell DG Lie algebra\n\u0010\n\u0011\n^\nTpoly = \u0393(X, T (1,0) X), [\u2212W, * ]SN , [ * , * ]SN\n\nof polyvector fields, where [ * , * ]SN is the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket extending\nthe Lie bracket from vector fields to polyvector fields; we will recall the definition\nin section 3.

We take its objects, interpreted as D-branes, to be odd\nsquare supermatrices D with polynomial entries such that D 2 = W * e, where e\nis the identity matrix of the same size as D. Such matrix factorisations are also\nthe objects of the off-shell DG category DG(W ) whose morphisms D \u2192 D \u2032 are\npolynomial supermatrices \u03c8 such that the compositions D \u2032 \u03c8 and \u03c8D make sense.\nThe differential on the Z2 -graded spaces HomDG(W ) (D, D \u2032 ) is the boundary BRST\noperator\nd : \u03c8 7\u2212\u2192 D \u2032 \u03c8 \u2212 (\u22121)|\u03c8| \u03c8D\nfor homogeneous \u03c8.

Open topological string theory\n\nOur main motivation is to enrich the above structure of open/closed topological\nfield theory for Landau-Ginzburg models to that of open/closed topological string\ntheory. In the next section we will face this task by studying bulk-deformed open\ntopological string theory; here we very briefly review the construction of the pure\nboundary sector.\nAs we recalled in the introduction, constructing open topological string theories\nfrom Landau-Ginzburg models amounts to endowing the on-shell open string\nspaces\nH = EndMF(W ) (D)\nwith the correct A\u221e -structures for all matrix factorisations D. The first natural\nstep is to use the minimal model construction of proposition 2.2 to transport the\nDG structure \u2202 (with r1 = [D, * ] and r2 coming from matrix multiplication) of\nthe off-shell space\nA = EndDG(W ) (D)\n\n15\n\n\fto an A\u221e -structure on H.\nUnfortunately, the thus obtained A\u221e -structure on the on-shell space H is generically not cyclic with respect to the Kapustin-Li pairing (2.19) and does hence\nnot correctly encode the topological string amplitudes. As explained in detail\nin [9] one can however use methods of formal non-commutative geometry [39, 42]\nto construct the full structure of open topological string theory. The main idea of\nthis approach is to enhance the Kapustin-Li pairing (2.19) to a non-commutative\nsymplectic form that is suitably compatible with the generic A\u221e -structure on H\nand then use a version of the Darboux theorem to transform it to a cyclic structure\ne An alternative, non-explicit existence proof of cyclic A\u221e -structures on H was\n\u2202.\nsketched in [19], and in subsection 3.1.1 below we will sketch how to drastically\nimprove the above-mentioned explicit construction using symplectic forms.\nThe goal of our study in the present paper are bulk-induced deformations of the\ne We\nopen topological string theory encoded in the on-shell A\u221e -structure (H, \u2202).\nhave recalled in this section how this originates from the off-shell DG structure\n(A, \u2202), and also that deformations of A\u221e -structures are classified by Hochschild\ncohomology. Thus it is a welcome fact that the latter is given by the space of\nbulk fields:\nHH\u2022 (A, \u2202) \u223c\n= Jac(W ) .\nThis result will be proved along with theorem 3.1 in the next section. We further\nnote that the Hochschild cohomology of the full category DG(W ) is also given\nby Jac(W ) as shown in [18].\n\n3. Bulk-deformed Landau-Ginzburg models\ne\nThe notion of bulk-induced deformations of the on-shell boundary space (H, \u2202)\nrelies on the existence of an L\u221e -morphism\ne * ], [ * , * ])\nL : (Tpoly , [\u2212W, * ]SN , [ * , * ]SN ) \u2212\u2192 (Coder(TH ), [\u2202,\n\n(3.1)\n\n(Tpoly , [\u2212W, * ]SN , [ * , * ]SN ) \u2212\u2192 (Coder(TA ), [\u2202, * ], [ * , * ])\n\n(3.2)\n\nfrom the DG Lie algebra of off-shell bulk fields to the DG Lie algebra of coderivations on the boundary side. A bulk-induced deformation is then defined as the\nimage under L of a deformation of the pure bulk theory. In this section we give\nan explicit construction of L.\nThe map (3.1) splits naturally as the composition of two L\u221e -morphisms that\nwe discuss in subsections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. The first is an L\u221e -quasiisomorphism\n\nand thus identifies the two deformation problems. It can be viewed as a \"weak\"\nversion of Kontsevich's construction for (local) deformation quantisation, or\n\n16\n\n\frather its complex cousin. The second L\u221e -morphism\ne * ], [ * , * ])\n(Coder(TA ), [\u2202, * ], [ * , * ]) \u2212\u2192 (Coder(TH ), [\u2202,\n\n(3.3)\n\ntransports off-shell deformations on-shell and can be viewed as the L\u221e formulation and enhancement of the homological perturbation lemma.7\n\n3.1. Weak deformation quantisation\nWe continue to use the notation of the previous section; in particular we fix a\npotential W \u2208 R = C[x1 , . . . , xN ], a matrix factorisation D, and with it the offshell and on-shell open string algebras A = EndDG(W ) (D) and H = EndMF(W ) (D),\nrespectively.\nAs follows from our earlier discussion, bulk deformations of B-twisted LandauGinzburg models are solutions \u03b3 \u2208 Tpoly of the Maurer-Cartan equation\n1\n[\u2212W, \u03b3]SN + [\u03b3, \u03b3]SN = 0 ,\n2\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket on Tpoly is given by\n[\u03b61 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b6m , \u03be1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03ben ]SN =\n\nm X\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+j [\u03b6i , \u03bej ]\n\ni=1 j=1\n\n* \u03b61 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b6i\u22121 \u2227 \u03b6i+1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b6m \u2227 \u03be1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03bej\u22121 \u2227 \u03bej+1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03ben\nand\n[\u03b61 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b6m , f ]SN =\n\nm\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03b6i (f )\u03b61 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b6i\u22121 \u2227 \u03b6i+1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b6m\n\ni=1\n\nfor \u03b6i , \u03bej \u2208 \u0393(X, T (1,0) X) and f \u2208 \u0393(X, OX ).\nour attention to formal power series in a set of parameters t, i. e. \u03b3 =\nPWe restrict\ni (i)\ni>1 t \u03b3 . This assumption allows to solve (3.4) perturbatively. At first order\nthe equation reads\n[\u2212W, \u03b3 (1) ]SN = 0 ,\n(3.5)\nand hence we have, up to gauge transformations, \u03b3 (1) \u2208 Jac(W ), the on-shell bulk\nspace. One simplicity of affine Landau-Ginzburg models lies in the fact that the\nsolutions of (3.5) are automatically solutions of the full Maurer-Cartan equation,\nas the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of two functions vanishes. Having thus fully\nsolved the deformation problem in the bulk sector, the problem of computing\n7\n\nAs we are concerned with the Hochschild cochain complex of the second kind, the map (3.2)\nis a quasi-isomorphism, while the map (3.3) is generically not. However, if we used the\nHochschild cochain complex of the first kind, (3.3) would always be a quasi-isomorphism,\nbut generically not (3.2). See also remark 2.4.\n\n17\n\n\fbulk-induced deformations reduces to that of transporting bulk deformations appropriately to the boundary sector. The first main result in accomplishing this\ntask is the following, which at its core is a weak version of deformation quantisation.\nTheorem 3.1. (Coder(TA ), [\u2202, * ], [ * , * ]) and (Tpoly , [\u2212W, * ]SN , [ * , * ]SN ) are quasiisomorphic as L\u221e -algebras.\nTo understand this result a crucial role is played by the curved associative\nalgebra\n(A, \u22020 + \u22022 ) with \u220201 = \u2212W * e ,\nwhere e denotes the identity matrix of the same size as D. In the following we will\nwrite \u2202 as \u22021 + \u22022 to distinguish it from \u22020 + \u22022 . We proceed to give a constructive\nproof of the above theorem. For the purpose of clarity we shall split it into the\nfollowing three parts.\nLemma 3.2. There is an L\u221e -quasi-isomorphism\n(Coder(TA ), [\u22021 + \u22022 , * ], [ * , * ]) \u2212\u2192 (Coder(TA ), [\u22020 + \u22022 , * ], [ * , * ]) .\nProof. We define a weak coalgebra isomorphism T (for off-shell \"tadpolecancellation\", i. e. T is a weak A\u221e -isomorphism to a non-curved A\u221e -algebra)\nvia its fundamental maps T0 = \u2212D and T1 = idA[1] , and we compute\n[(\u22021 + \u22022 ) \u25e6 T ]10 = [D, \u2212D] + D(\u2212D) = \u2212W * e = [T \u25e6 (\u22020 + \u22022 )]10 ,\n[(\u22021 + \u22022 ) \u25e6 T ]11 = [D, * ] \u2212 \u220221 (D \u2297 idA[1] + idA[1] \u2297 D) = 0 = [T \u25e6 (\u22020 + \u22022 )]11 ,\n[(\u22021 + \u22022 ) \u25e6 T ]12 = \u220221 = [T \u25e6 (\u22020 + \u22022 )]12 .\nHence we have (\u22021 + \u22022 ) \u25e6 T = T \u25e6 (\u22020 + \u22022 ), i. e. T is a weak A\u221e -isomorphism\nfrom (A, \u22020 + \u22022 ) to (A, \u22021 + \u22022 ). The L\u221e -morphism is then given by the adjoint\naction of T . That it is a quasi-isomorphism follows from the fact that Hochschild\ncohomology of the second kind is invariant under curved DG isomorphisms [58].\nThe next step in the proof of theorem 3.1 is an L\u221e -version of Morita equivalence:\nLemma 3.3. There is an L\u221e -quasi-isomorphism\n(Coder(TA ), [\u22020 + \u22022 , * ], [ * , * ]) \u2212\u2192 (Coder(TR ), [\u2202b0 + \u2202b2 , * ], [ * , * ]) ,\n\nwhere \u2202b0 + \u2202b2 is the codifferential on TR induced from \u22020 + \u22022 .\n\n18\n\n\fProof. First we construct the cotrace map C11 = cotr : Coder(TR ) \u2192 Coder(TA ),\nthen we show that the coalgebra morphism C defined by C 1 = C11 is the desired\nL\u221e -quasi-isomorphism. The cotrace map is a slightly modified version of the\ncase for ungraded algebras, see e. g. [50]: for \u03a6 \u2208 Coder(TR ) we define cotr(\u03a6) \u2208\nCoder(TA ) via cotr(\u03a6)10 = \u03a610 * e and\ncotr(\u03a6)1m (a1\n\n\u2297 . . . \u2297 am )\n\n\u0001\n\nkl\n\n=\n\n2n\nX\n\n\u03a61m ((\u03c3 m+1 a1 )ki1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 (\u03c3am )im\u22121 l )\n\ni1 ,...,im\u22121 =1\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the unique matrix that for homogenous elements a \u2208 A satisfies\n\u03c3a = (\u22121)|a| a\u03c3, and 2n is the size of D. It is then straightforward to show that\n[cotr(\u03a61 ), cotr(\u03a62 )] = cotr([\u03a61 , \u03a62 ]) ,\n\n(3.6)\n\ni. e. cotr is a map of Lie algebras. In order to show that C is an L\u221e -morphism\nit then suffices to check that cotr is a map of complexes. This however follows\nimmediately from (3.6) by noting that\n\u22020 + \u22022 = cotr(\u2202b0 + \u2202b2 ) .\n\nThat C11 is indeed a quasi-isomorphism follows from a spectral sequence argument\nand will be shown together with the next proposition.\nNow we arrive at the last and hardest step in the proof of theorem 3.1.\nProposition 3.4. (Coder(TR ), [\u2202b0 + \u2202b2 , * ], [ * , * ]) and (Tpoly , [\u2212W, * ]SN , [ * , * ]SN )\nare quasi-isomorphic as L\u221e -algebras.\n\nFortunately we can build on Kontsevich's result on deformation quantisation [40] which says that the above is true for the case W = 0. More precisely,\nKontsevich's result concerns polyvector fields on Rd , but as we are dealing with\naffine space, his result extends trivially.\nBefore delving into the proof of proposition 3.4, let us briefly recall the aim and\nmethod of deformation quantisation. One is interested in quantising a classical\nsystem described by a phase space M (a real smooth manifold, for simplicity\nconsider M = Rd ) or alternatively rather by its commutative, associative algebra\nof observables (C \u221e (M, R), * ). Quantising in this context amounts to deforming\nthe multiplication \" * \" to an associative, but not necessarily commutative product\n\"\u22c6\", in order to pass to the algebra of quantum observables (C \u221e (M, R)[[~]], \u22c6)\nwhile postponing the task of representing it on a Hilbert space. Below we will\ndrop formal parameters like ~ from our notation.\nTo rephrase the problem in a more compact notation, we denote \" * \" by \u220221\nso that the deformation problem becomes that of solving the Maurer-Cartan\n\n19\n\n\fequation of the DG Lie algebra (Coder(TC \u221e (M,R) ), [\u22022 , * ], [ * , * ]). Kontsevich's\nsolution is to construct an L\u221e -quasi-isomorphism\n^\nK : (\u0393(M, T M), [ * , * ]SN ) \u2212\u2192 (Coder(TC \u221e (M,R) ), [\u22022 , * ], [ * , * ]) .\n\nThus by proposition 2.3 every perturbatively deformed product \"\u22c6\" originates\nfrom a Poisson structure on M, i. e. a degree 2 polyvector field \u03b1 which satisfies\nthe Maurer-Cartan equation [\u03b1, \u03b1]SN = 0.\nAs already observed, we can view our theorem 3.1 as a generalisation of deformation quantisation: endowed with a non-trivial differential [\u2212W, * ], the DG Lie\nalgebra of polyvector fields now governs deformations of a DG algebra, and not\njust a commutative associative one.\nThe proof of proposition 3.4 splits into two parts. First we show that the L\u221e morphism K can be extended to the case W 6= 0, then we show that it is still a\nquasi-isomorphism.\nProof. We start by recalling Kontsevich's construction. The L\u221e -morphism K is\ngiven by\nX\n(Kn1 (\u03b31 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b3n ))1m =\nw\u0393 U\u0393\n\u0393\u2208G(n,m)\n\nwhere G(n, m) denotes the set of certain directed graphs \u0393 to which in turn we\nwill associate certain weights w\u0393 \u2208 R and multilinear maps U\u0393 on R[1]. To\ndescribe these, consider the unit disc D in the complex plane. Choose m marked\npoints q1\u0304 , . . . , qm\u0304 (which we associate with functions f1\u0304 , . . . , fm\u0304 ) on the boundary\n\u2202D and n marked points p1 , . . . , pn (which we associate with polyvector fields\n\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n ) in the interior. These m + n marked points coincide with the vertices\nof the graph \u0393 \u2208 G(n, m).\nThe possible edges between vertices are constrained by the following rules: (i)\nfor every polyvector field \u03b3k , there are precisely \u03b3ek edges e1k , . . . , e\u03b3kek starting at\npk and ending on distinct marked points different from pk , (ii) each marked point\non the boundary has zero outgoing edges and at least one incoming edge, (iii) the\ntotal number of edges is dim(C n,m ) = 2n + m \u2212 2 > 0, where we denote by C n,m\nthe moduli space of the above described marked points on the unit disc with a\nchoice of orientation. Here we run clockwise around the circle and the orientation\nis well-defined by omitting the point i \u2208 \u2202D. This special point is to be viewed\nas representing the \"out-state\".\nTo construct the map U\u0393 \u2208 Hom(R[1]\u2297m , R[1]) for fixed polyvector fields\n\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n , one views the edges ending on a vertex as the action of the coordinate vector fields on the function associated to the vertex and then takes the\nproduct over all such actions. More precisely, if we write\n\u03b3i = \u03b3 ji,1 ...ji,e\u03b3i \u2202ji,1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u2202ji,e\u03b3\n\ni\n\n20\n\n\fand denote by \u0393\u2022\u2192k the set of edges ending on vertex k, then we have\nU\u0393 (f1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 fm ) =\n\nn \u0010 Y\nXhY\ni=1\n\nI\n\ne\u2208\u0393\u2022\u2192i\n\nm\u0304\n\u0011 i\n\u0011\ne\n\u03b3 ih Y \u0010\nY\nI(e1 )...I(ei i )\n\u2202I(e) f\uf6be\u0304\n\u2202I(e) \u03b3i i\n\uf6be\u0304=1\u0304\n\ne\u2208\u0393\u2022\u2192\uf6be\u0304\n\nwhere the sum is over all maps I : \u03931 \u2192 {1, . . . , d}.\nThe weights w\u0393 are certain integrals over the moduli space C n,m . In order to\nunderstand these, consider for every edge erk , the angle map \u03c6erk : D \u00d7D \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0]\nmeasuring the (clockwise) angle between the edge erk and the line connecting pk\nto the out-state at i.8 If we denote by \u03b9 : C n,m \u2192 D \u00d7n \u00d7 \u2202D \u00d7m the canonical\nembedding of the moduli space, then the weights are given by\nw\u0393 =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)2n+m\u22122\n\nZ\n\n\u03b9(C\n\nn,m\n\nn\n^\n\n(d\u03c6ek1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 d\u03c6ek ) .\n\n) k=1\n\ne\n\u03b3k\n\n(3.7)\n\nWe are now in a position to start with the proof proper.

Pick an edge erk ending\non \u2212W and carry the corresponding differential form d\u03c6erk to the very left of the\nPk\u22121\nintegral (3.7). This results in picking up a sign \u03bc = (\u22121) s=1 \u03b3es (\u22121)r\u22121 . Now\nconsider the l-th term in (3.8).

The sign \u03bc is the product of the\nsign present on the left-hand side of the equation times the sign coming from the\nSchouten-Nijenhuis bracket, and we see that (3.8) indeed holds true.\nWe will now prove that K11 is a quasi-isomorphism. Consider \u03b3 \u2208 Tpoly of\ndegree e\n\u03b3 = n. By construction (K11 (\u03b3))1 (f1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 fm ) is non-zero only for m = n\nand is given by\n(K11 (\u03b3))1n (f1\n\nn\nY\n1 X\ni1 ...in\n\u2202i\u03c3(k) fk .\nsign(\u03c3)\u03b3\n\u2297 . . . \u2297 fn ) =\nn! \u03c3\u2208S\nk=1\nn\n\nBy the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem K11 is a quasi-isomorphism from\n(Tpoly , 0) to (Coder(TR ), [\u2202b2 , * ]).\nTo show that K11 is also a quasi-isomorphism in our case W 6= 0, the strategy\nis to view (Coder(TR ), [\u2202b0 + \u2202b2 , * ]) as a bicomplex after choosing appropriate\nlinear combinations of tensor and tilde degrees. We then choose to compute the\n22\n\n\fassociated spectral sequence whose first page is [\u2202b2 , * ]-cohomology. The spectral\nsequence degenerates at the second page yielding\nH[\u2202b0 +\u2202b2 , * ] (Coder(TR )) = HH\u2022 (R, \u2202b0 + \u2202b2 ) = Jac(W ) ,\n\nsee appendix A.1 for details. As explained also in [14, 58], the chosen spectral\nsequence computes Hochschild cohomology of the second kind. This concludes\nthe proof of proposition 3.4.\nEssentially the same argument is used if we replace Coder(TR ) with Coder(TA )\nin the setting of lemma 3.3. The first page then is classical Morita equivalence\nwhose proof is the same in the Z2 -graded case.\n3.1.1. Constructing the off-shell Kapustin-Li pairing\nWe close this subsection with a short discussion of another application in which\nthe tadpole-cancellation map T introduced in the proof of lemma 3.2 plays a\nprominent role. This application concerns the construction of the off-shell or\nA\u221e -enrichment of the Kapustin-Li trace and pairing, and it is independent from\nthe remainder of the present paper. To be brief we assume familiarity with basic\nnon-commutative geometry [42, 50] and its relation to A\u221e -theory; we will use the\nnotation of [9, 48].\nAs explained in [9], one way to construct the Calabi-Yau A\u221e -structure encoding the open topological string theory on the on-shell space H is to first find a\nnon-commutative homologically symplectic form \u03c9 that is the A\u221e -version of the\nKapustin-Li pairing and satisfies the generalised cyclicity condition LQ \u03c9 = 0,\nwhere Q encodes the DG structure on A. Then in a second step one applies the\nDarboux theorem and thus pushes Q forward to the correct cyclic A\u221e -structure.\nIn the approach of [9] the first step is the computationally much more challenging\none, and \u03c9 was constructed only perturbatively by an algorithm that is applied\ncase by case. Now we will describe how to obtain an explicit and general expression for \u03c9.\nIt turns out that on the off-shell or A\u221e -level there is an interesting subtlety in\nthe relation between the Kapustin-Li trace and pairing that partly arises from the\nrelation between Hochschild and cyclic homology. We recall that the Hochschild\nchain complex (C\u2022 (A), b) of an A\u221e -algebra (A, \u2202) is dual to (C 1 (BA ), LQ ), where\nQ = \u2202 \u2228 and we agree to indicate the non-vanishing A\u221e -products as indices in Q\nand b. Then it is straightforward to construct the following sequence of maps\nand show that they are all quasi-isomorphisms:\nT\u2217\nstr\n(C 1 (BA ), LQ1,2 )\u2217 \u2212\u2192 (C\u2022 (A), b1,2 ) \u2212\u2192\n(C\u2022 (A), b0,2 ) \u2212\u2192 (C\u2022 (R), bb0,2 )\nHKR\n\nRes\n\n\u2212\u2192 (\u03a9\u2022 (CN ), dW \u2227 ( * )) \u2212\u2192 C .\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn this way we obtain an explicit expression for a 1-form \u03b8 \u2208 C 1 (BA ) whose\nconstant part agrees with the Kapustin-Li trace, and by construction it satisfies\n\n23\n\n\fLQ1,2 \u03b8 = 0. The last four maps in (3.9) were also independently constructed\nin [61].\nTo arrive at an expression for the A\u221e -version of the Kapustin-Li pairing, a\nnatural guess is to find a solution \u03c9 \u2032 of the equation LX\u222aY \u03b8 = \u03c9 \u2032 (X, Y ) for all\nnon-commutative vector fields X, Y . However, one finds that while LQ1,2 \u03c9 \u2032 = 0\nholds by construction, such an \u03c9 \u2032 is not necessarily homologically symplectic.\n(Indeed, \u03c9 \u2032 is precisely of the form of the special solution of LQ1,2 \u03c9 \u2032 = 0 discussed\nat the end of section 2 in [9].)\nIn order to construct the true off-shell version \u03c9 of the Kapustin-Li pairing, one\ndoes not have to compute the Hochschild complex but rather the cyclic complex\n(CC\u2022 (A), b + uB) whose differential also features Connes' operator B. So instead\nof (3.9) one must consider\n\u03ba\n\n(Ccl2 (BA ), LQ1,2 )\u2217 \u2212\u2192 (C 0 (BA ), LQ1,2 )\u2217 \u2212\u2192 (C \u03bb (A), b1,2 ) \u2212\u2192 (CC\u2022 (A), b1,2 + uB)\nT\u2217\nstr\n\u2212\u2192\n(CC\u2022 (A), b0,2 + uB) \u2212\u2192 (CC\u2022 (R), bb0,2 + uB)\n\u03c1\n\nHKR\n\n\u2212\u2192 (\u03a9\u2022 (CN ), dW \u2227 ( * ) + ud) \u2212\u2192 C\n\nwhere C \u03bb (A) denotes Connes' complex. Again for most of the above maps\nit is straightforward to check that they are explicitly constructible quasiisomorphisms. Only the maps \u03ba and \u03c1 are more interesting: \u03ba is a generalisation\nto the DG level of a result on associative algebras in [36], while one way to obtain \u03c1 is to apply the method of homological perturbation also discussed in the\nnext subsection.\nIn the end one arrives at a homologically symplectic form \u03c9 \u2208 C 2 (BA ) whose\nconstant part is the Kapustin-Li pairing. The details of this construction will\nappear in future work. We note that this explicit expression for \u03c9 together\nwith the results of the present paper allow for a significantly more efficient and\ngeneral computational method to determine the effective superpotential Weff (u, t)\nto arbitrary orders also in the bulk moduli from first principles.\n\n3.2. Transporting bulk deformations on-shell\nAfter having found the solutions to the Maurer-Cartan equation describing bulkinduced deformations of the off-shell open string algebra, we are now faced with\nthe task of transporting them on-shell. We shall do so by constructing an L\u221e morphism\ne * ], [ * , * ]) .\n(Coder(TA ), [\u2202, * ], [ * , * ]) \u2212\u2192 (Coder(TH ), [\u2202,\n\n(3.10)\n\ne is a deformation retract of (TA , \u2202). We\nA crucial observation is that (TH , \u2202)\nwill start with a general discussion of this notion on the level of complexes and\nof the natural L\u221e -morphism that it gives rise to. Then we will specialise to\nour case of open string algebras, explicitly construct the associated deformation\n\n24\n\n\fretract data, and thus arrive at the L\u221e -morphism (3.10) to transport the offe\nshell deformation \u03b4 from the previous subsection to the on-shell algebra (H, \u2202).\nWhile we will apply it to the case of Landau-Ginzburg models, we note that our\nconstruction of the map (3.10) works for arbitrary A\u221e -algebras (A, \u2202) and their\ne\nminimal models (H, \u2202).\n3.2.1. Deformation retractions\nA deformation retraction\ni\n\n(C2 , d2 ) o\n\n/\n\np\n\n(C1 , d1 ) b\n\nh\n\n(3.11)\n\nconsists of the following data: two complexes (C1 , d1 ) and (C2 , d2 ), two maps of\ncomplexes i : (C2 , d2) \u2192 (C1 , d1 ) and p : (C1 , d1) \u2192 (C2 , d2 ), and a homotopy\nh \u2208 End(C1 ). These data are subject to the relations\npi = idC2 ,\n\nidC1 \u2212 ip = d1 h + hd1 ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nand we refer to (C2 , d2 ) as the deformation retract of (C1 , d1 ). The homotopy h\nis said to be in standard form if it satisfies\nhh = hi = ph = 0 .\nGiven the data (3.11), we can construct maps Mn1 : End(C1 )[1]\u2227n \u2192 End(C2 )[1]\nvia\nX\n\u03b5\u03c3;a1 ,...,an pa\u03c3(1) h a\u03c3(2) . . . ha\u03c3(n) i\nMn1 (a1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 an ) =\n\u03c3\u2208Sn\n\nfor all homogeneous a1 , . . . , an \u2208 End(C1 ), where \u03b5\u03c3;a1 ,...,an denotes the Koszul\nsign introduced in subsection 2.1. We will denote by M the coalgebra morphism\nSEnd(C1 ) \u2192 SEnd(C2 ) uniquely defined from the maps Mn1 . This morphism is the\ncentral ingredient of our version of the homological perturbation lemma:\nProposition 3.5. M : (End(C1 ), [d1, * ], [ * , * ]) \u2192 (End(C2 ), [d2 , * ], [ * , * ]) is an\nL\u221e -quasi-isomorphism.\nProof. It is convenient to define also the collection of maps Sn1 : End(C1 )[1]\u2297n \u2192\nEnd(C2 )[1] by\nSn1 (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) = pa1 ha2 . . . han i .\nIn fact we are going to prove that the corresponding coalgebra morphism S is an\nA\u221e -quasi-isomorphism and hence M will be the L\u221e -morphism induced by S on\nthe commutator algebra.\nFirst we prove that S is an A\u221e -morphism, i. e.\n1\nSn1 bnn + Sn\u22121\nbnn\u22121 = eb11 Sn1 + eb12 Sn2\n\n25\n\n(3.13)\n\n\fwhere b11 and b12 are defined by b11 (a) = [d1 , a] and b12 (a1 \u2297 a2 ) = (\u22121)ea1 a1 a2 and\nsimilarly eb11 and eb12 . For n = 1 the condition (3.13) is easily checked,\neb1 S 1 (a) = [d2 , pai] = p[d1 , a]i = S 1 b1 (a)\n1 1\n1 1\n\nwhere we have only used that i and p are maps of complexes.\nTo prove (3.13) for all n > 1 we first compute\neb1 S 1 (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) = p[d1 , a1 ha2 . . . han ]i\n1 n\n=p\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)\n\nPk\u22121\nl=1\n\ne\nai\n\na1 h . . . [d1 , ak h] . . . han + (\u22121)\n\nPn\u22121\nl=1\n\ne\nai\n\na1 ha2 . . . h[d1 , an ] i\n\nk=1\n\n= Sn1 bnn (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) \u2212 p\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)\n\nPk\n\nai\nl=1 e\n\na1 h . . . ak [d1 , h]ak+1 . . . han\n\nk=1\n\n!\n\n!\n\ni\n\nwhere we have only used that S11 is a map of complexes. Now we only have to\ninsert the identity [d1 , h] = idC1 \u2212 ip in the above equation to obtain the desired\nresult.\nIn order to conclude the proof we still need to show that M11 is a quasiisomorphism. We already know that M11 is a map of complexes and since (C2 , d2 )\nis a deformation retract of (C1 , d1 ), we are left to verify that if a \u2208 End(C1 ) represents a non-trivial element in b11 -cohomology, then pai 6= 0. Suppose however\npai = 0, then\n0 = ipaip = (idC1 \u2212 [d1 , h])a(idC1 \u2212 [d1 , h])\n(3.14)\nand hence a = b11 ([h, a] \u2212 ha[d1 , h]). This contradicts the assumption on a.\n3.2.2. Deformation retractions from A\u221e -algebras\nThe L\u221e -morphism M allows us to transport deformations of (C1 , d1 ) to deformations of (C2 , d2). In our case of interest these two complexes are given by (TA , \u2202)\ne respectively, and we ask for the additional property that the deforand (TH , \u2202),\nmation of \u2202e must continue to be an A\u221e -structure. Hence we will now explain\nunder which circumstances this is guaranteed to be the case, i. e. when (3.10)\nmaps coderivations to coderivations.\nProposition 3.6. Assume that\n(TA2 , \u22022 ) o\n\ni\n\n/\n\np\n\n(TA1 , \u22021 ) b\n\nh\n\n(3.15)\n\nis a deformation retraction where (A1 , \u22021 ) and (A2 , \u22022 ) are A\u221e -algebras, and h is\nin standard form. Then for a1 , . . . , an \u2208 Coder(TA1 ), we have Mn1 (a1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 an ) \u2208\nCoder(TA2 ) for all n > 1.\n\n26\n\n\fProof. Let us introduce some convenient notation: We write A = End(TA1 ), and\nfor an element f \u2208 End(TA1 ), let Lf and Rf denote the left and right multiplication by f , respectively. Define the left and right ideals IL = Ker(Ri ) \u2229 Ker(Rh )\nand IR = Ker(Lp )\u2229Ker(Lh ). Since h is in standard form, we have h \u2208 I = IL \u2229IR .\nFinally we define \u03c0 = ip, J = IL + IR and B = linC (idTA1 \u2212 \u03c0).\nNow we will show that in fact Sn1 (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) is a coderivation. Denote\n\u039bn = a1 ha2 . . . han and assume without loss of generality that a1 , . . . , an are\nhomogeneous. The crucial observation is that \u2206\u039bn admits the decomposition\n(proved in appendix A.2)\n\u2206\u039bn = ((idTA1 + B) \u2297 \u039bn + \u039bn \u2297 (idTA1 + B) + J \u2297 A + A \u2297 J)\u2206 ,\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere we use a short-hand notation where e. g. \"J \u2297 A\" means \"some element in\nJ \u2297 A\". It then follows that Sn1 (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) = p\u039bn i satisfies\n\u2206p\u039bn i = (p\u039bn i \u2297 idTA2 + idTA2 \u2297 p\u039bn i)\u2206 ,\nwhich says that Sn1 (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 an ) is a coderivation.\nWe have thus proved that M continues to be an L\u221e -morphism when restricted to coderivations. However, it will then generically no longer be a quasiisomorphism (as we discuss in appendix A.3).\n3.2.3. On-shell bulk-induced deformations\nProposition 3.6 enables us, given a deformation retraction of A\u221e -algebras (3.15),\nto transport deformations of \u22021 to deformations of \u22022 . To accomplish our aim\nto construct bulk-deformed open topological string theories for Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels, we are now left to specify the deformation retract data\ne o\n(TH , \u2202)\n\nF\n\n/\n\n(TA , \u2202) b\n\nU\n\n(3.17)\n\nF\u0304\n\npaying attention to the condition that the homotopy U be in standard form. In\nwriting (3.17) we have already revealed that in the case at hand the inclusion map\ne \u2192 (A, \u2202) of proposition 2.2.\nis given by the minimal model morphism F : (H, \u2202)\nIt remains to find its homotopy inverse F\u0304 and the homotopy U itself. This is\nachieved by the next proposition which constructs F\u0304 and U explicitly.\nProposition 3.7. For any A\u221e -algebra (A, \u2202), there exist a unique colagebra\nmorphism F\u0304 and a map U that make (3.17) a deformation retraction and satisfy\nthe conditions\n1\n\u2206U = (U \u2297 (idTA + F F\u0304 ) + (idTA + F F\u0304 ) \u2297 U)\u2206 ,\n2\nU11 = G ,\n\n27\n\n(3.18)\n\n\fUn1 = \u2212G\u220221 Un2 for n > 2 ,\nF\u030411 = \u03c0H ,\nF\u0304n1 = \u2212\u03c0H ([\u2202, U])1n = \u2212\u03c0H \u220221 Un2 .\n\n(3.19)\n(3.20)\n\nMoreover, these conditions allow for an explicit construction of F\u0304 , U, and U is in\nstandard form.\nThe rather technical proof of the above proposition can be found in appendix A.4.\nNow we have arrived at the point to put together all the results obtained in this\nsection. We apply the L\u221e -morphism M of proposition 3.5 in conjunction with the\ndeformation retraction of proposition 3.7. Recall that in the previous subsection\nwe found that for Landau-Ginzburg models off-shell deformations \u03b4 \u2208 Coder(TA )\nare precisely the bulk-induced coderivations determined by\nX\n\u03b401 =\nti \u03c6i\n(3.21)\ni\n\nwhere {\u03c6i } is a basis of the bulk space Jac(W ), and ti are the associated moduli.\nBy proposition 2.3 we can use M to map \u03b4 to deformations \u03b4e of the on-shell open\ne and proposition 3.6 ensures that \u2202e + \u03b4e indeed encodes an\nstring algebra (H, \u2202),\nA\u221e -structure. Thus our final result is the following.\nTheorem 3.8. The bulk-induced deformations of the on-shell Landau-Ginzburg\ne are given by\nopen string algebra (H, \u2202)\n\u03b4e =\n\nX 1\nX\nMn1 (\u03b4 \u2227n ) =\nF\u0304 (\u03b4U)n \u03b4F = F\u0304 (idTA \u2212 \u03b4U)\u22121 \u03b4F .\nn!\nn>1\nn>1\n\n(3.22)\n\nBy substituting (3.21) together with the concrete formulas for F, F\u0304 and U\ninto (3.22), one obtains explicit expressions for bulk-deformed A\u221e -products on H.\nTo make sure that the bulk moduli dependent A\u221e -structure encoded in \u2202e + \u03b4e\nimmediately describes all amplitudes of bulk-deformed open topological string\ntheory, it has to be shown that also the deformed A\u221e -products are cyclic with\nrespect to the Kapustin-Li pairing.\nLet us for the moment restrict to those bulk fields that \"are seen by the open\nTFT of the brane D\", i. e. those \u03c6 \u2208 Jac(W ) that are not mapped to zero by the\nbulk-boundary map. We denote an off-shell deformation that arises from such a\nbulk field by \u03b4Z . Then the on-shell deformation \u03b4eZ takes a particularly simple\nform in our approach:\n\u03b4eZ = F\u0304 (idTA \u2212 \u03b4Z U)\u22121 \u03b4Z F = F\u0304 \u03b4Z F = \u03b4Z ,\n28\n\n\fwhere we have used the fact that the image of F only consists of tensor powers\nof elements in H and the complement of Ker([D, * ]) (see (2.7)), and that U acts\nas G on one tensor factor of each summand. Furthermore, since \u03b4Z is a pure\ncoordinate coderivation, it follows that the Lie derivative of the flat part of the\nsymplectic form \u03c9 mentioned in subsections 2.2.2 and 3.1.1 with respect to \u03b4Z\u2228\nvanishes. As explained in detail in [9], this means that the A\u221e -structure \u2202e + \u03b4eZ\nis indeed cyclic.\nThe rigidity of the methods used in transporting bulk deformations on-shell\nmay suggest the cyclicity of \u2202e + \u03b4e also in the general case when the off-shell bulk\ndeformation is not of the form \u03b4Z . However, then the abstract manipulation of \u03b4e\nin (3.22) is more difficult, and at this point we have no proof that \u2202e + \u03b4e is cyclic.\nBut even if this were not the case, if there are no obstructions in principle one\ncan do on-shell tadpole-cancellation as discussed in [27], i. e. construct a weak\ne to a non-curved A\u221e -algebra. As opposed to\nA\u221e -isomorphism from (H, \u2202e + \u03b4)\nthe case of off-shell tadpole-cancellation (see the proof of lemma 3.2) such a map\nmay not exist, and its conceptual understanding is incomplete; it exists precisely\niff there are no obstructions. Then the approach of [9] is applicable and one\ncan obtain the correct bulk-deformed, tadpole-cancelled and cyclic A\u221e -structure.\nThis is in particular true for the special brane which is the compact generator\nof the category all matrix fatorisations, and hence by a standard argument the\nCalabi-Yau A\u221e -structure can be lifted to the full D-brane category in this case\n(see [18]).\n\n4. Conclusion\nIn the present paper we have obtained a first-principle derivation of the bulkinduced deformations of all open topological string amplitudes arising from affine\nB-twisted Landau-Ginzburg models. Our approach is a conceptual step forward\nin that it provides a constructive method to compute amplitudes, instead of\ntrying to solve their defining A\u221e -constraints only by brute force.\nOur results will also be of practical use in the following sense. Together with\nthe methods of [9] or the direct construction of the off-shell Kapustin-Li pairing as\nsketched in subsection 3.1.1, our results enable us to perturbatively compute the\neffective D-brane superpotential Weff at tree level prior to tadpole-cancellation,\nto all orders in both boundary and bulk moduli, and for all branes in all LandauGinzburg models.\nThe main line of thought that permeates this work consists in making rigorous the link between the DG Lie algebra of bulk fields and the DG Lie algebra\ngoverning deformations of open string amplitudes, i. e. of the underlying CalabiYau A\u221e -structure. Our solution to the problem is the explicit construction of\nan L\u221e -morphism that transports pure bulk deformations to the boundary sector. This map is the composition of an L\u221e -quasi-isomorphism from the off-shell\n\n29\n\n\fbulk sector to the off-shell boundary sector, and of an L\u221e -morphism transporting\noff-shell boundary deformations on-shell. We saw that the former is a \"weak\" version of deformation quantisation, while the latter can be viewed as homological\nperturbation in its L\u221e -incarnation.\nThere are many interesting directions of research that are opened by our construction, and we shall name a few. One is rather immediate: in string theory\nit is orbifolded Landau-Ginzburg models that are particularly relevant, and one\nshould extend our methods for bulk deformations to orbifolds. A related question is that of the actual perturbative computation of Weff in concrete examples.\nIn the present paper it was our aim to address conceptual questions and give a\ncompletely general prescription to compute all bulk-deformed amplitudes in arbitrary affine Landau-Ginzburg models. But since our construction in theorem 3.8\nis entirely explicit, it will be straightforward to implement it on a computer. We\nleave such an implementation and the computation of examples for future work.\nAs mentioned before, the efficiency of the algorithm will be much improved by\nthe explicit formula for the off-shell Kapustin-Li pairing as sketched in subsection 3.1.1.\nA more conceptual matter is the following. While our map (3.2) transporting\noff-shell bulk deformations to off-shell boundary deformations is an L\u221e -quasiisomorphism, the map (3.3) to on-shell boundary deformations is not necessarily\na quasi-isomorphism. As a consequence there might be on-shell boundary deformations that are not bulk-induced. This may be related to the possible nonuniqueness of boundary sectors for a given bulk sector (in the case of non-rational\ntheories), as well as the different roles played by Hochschild cohomology of the\nfirst and second kind.\nFinally, we mention a question that goes beyond affine Landau-Ginzburg models. Our results appear to be the first coherent L\u221e -formulation of and solution\nto the problem of bulk-induced deformations in such models. It is natural to ask\nto what extent and how they can be generalised to non-affine Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels and even more general open topological string theories. Recall that our\nbulk-to-boundary transport splits into the two maps (3.2) and (3.3), the second\nof which is a model-independent construction. Hence the interesting question in\ngoing beyond affine Landau-Ginzburg models is how to generalise the map (3.2).\nWe expect that part of the general answer is that the left-hand side of (3.2) will\ncontinue to be the off-shell bulk space which always has a DG Lie algebra structure, just like the right-hand side of (3.2). Any such generalisation would at the\nsame time also give rise to a new variant of deformation quantisation.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Patrick B\u00f6hl, Ilka Brunner, Manfred Herbst, Calin Lazaroiu, Wolfgang\nLerche, Daniel Murfet and Masoud Soroush for discussions.\n\n30\n\n\fA. Details of some proofs\nA.1. A spectral sequence\nHere we present the spectral sequence computation used in the proof of proposition 3.4. First we note that (Coder(TR ), [\u2202b0 + \u2202b2 , * ]) is a mixed complex: [\u22020 , * ]\ndecreases tensor degree by 1 and increases tilde degree by 1, while [\u22022 , * ] increases tensor degree by 1 and increases tilde degree by 1.

The analogous spectral sequence in the case of (A, \u22021 + \u22022 ) is\nmore involved and degenerates only at the third page.\n\nA.2. Homological perturbation for coalgebras\nWe continue the proof of proposition 3.6. We will establish (3.16) by induction.\nFor this it is convenient to consider a sequence {ai }i\u2208N \u2282 Coder(TA1 ). Then we\nhave\n\u2206\u039bn+1 = \u2206\u039bn han+1\n= ((idTA1 + B) \u2297 \u039bn + \u039bn \u2297 (idTA1 + B) + J \u2297 A + A \u2297 J)\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n*\nh \u2297 (idTA1 + \u03c0) + (idTA1 + \u03c0) \u2297 h (an+1 \u2297 idTA1 + idTA1 \u2297 an+1 )\u2206 .\n2\nThe computation naturally splits into two steps, one involving the summand\n(idTA1 + B) \u2297\u039bn + \u039bn \u2297(idTA1 + B) and the other involving the term J \u2297A + A \u2297J\nin the first factor on the right-hand side above. For the first piece we have\n((idTA1 + B) \u2297 \u039bn + \u039bn \u2297 (idTA1 + B))\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\n* h \u2297 (idTA1 + \u03c0) + (idTA1 + \u03c0) \u2297 h)(an+1 \u2297 idTA1 + idTA1 \u2297 an+1\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n1\n= (idTA1 + B) \u2297 \u039bn + \u039bn \u2297 (idTA1 + B) han+1 \u2297 (idTA1 + \u03c0)\n2\n1\n1\n+ h \u2297 (idTA1 + \u03c0)an+1 + (\u22121)ean+1 (idTA1 + \u03c0)an+1 \u2297 h\n2\n2\n\u0011\n1\n+ (idTA1 + \u03c0) \u2297 han+1\n2\n= IR \u2297 A + I \u2297 A + A \u2297 IL + (idTA1 + B) \u2297 \u039bn han+1\n+ \u039bn han+1 \u2297 (idTA1 + B) + IL \u2297 A + A \u2297 I + A \u2297 IR ,\nwhere in the last step we have used that Lh B \u2282 IL . This is true because h(idTA1 \u2212\n\u03c0) = h\u2202h. We have thus proved that the first piece in the computation is of the\ndesired form. For the second piece we have\n\u0010\n1\n1\n(J \u2297 A + A \u2297 J) han+1 \u2297 (idTA1 + \u03c0) + h \u2297 (idTA1 + \u03c0)an+1\n2\n2\n\u0011\n1\n1\n+ (\u22121)ean+1 (idTA1 + \u03c0)an+1 \u2297 h + (idTA1 + \u03c0) \u2297 han+1\n2\n2\n= IR \u2297 A + I \u2297 A + A \u2297 IL + J \u2297 A + A \u2297 J + IL \u2297 A + A \u2297 I + A \u2297 IR\nwhich is again of the desired form.\n\n32\n\n\fA.3. More on the L\u221e -morphism M\nThis appendix supplements subsection 3.2.2. We give a brief explanation of why\nM11 : Coder(TA1 ) \u2192 Coder(TA2 ) is generically not a quasi-isomorphism. For\nsimplicity we denote CAi = Coder(TAi ) for i \u2208 {1, 2} and define g = M11 = p( * )i.\nConsider the short exact sequence\n0\n/\n\nf\n\nKer(g) o\n\n/\nr\n\nC A1 o\n\ng\n\n/\ns\n\nC A2\n\n0\n/\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere f denotes inclusion. As a sequence of modules, (A.1) is split exact with\nleft and right inverses r and s respectively given by r(\u03c6)1n = (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0\u03c6\u03c0)1n and\ns(\u03c8)1n = (i\u03c8p)1n for \u03c6 \u2208 CA1 and \u03c8 \u2208 CA2 . If we view Ker(g), CA1 and CA2 as complexes with the appropriate Hochschild differentials, f and g are promoted to maps\nof complexes and one can study the cohomology of CA2 , i. e. the Hochschild cohomology of (A2 , \u22022 ), by analysing the long exact sequence of cohomology groups\n...\n\n/ H(Ker(g))\n/\n\nH(CA1 )\n/\n\n\u03b4\n\nH(CA2 )\n\n/\n\nH(Ker(g))\n\n. . . (A.2)\n/\n\nwhere the coboundary map \u03b4 is given by \u03b4(\u03c8) = r([\u22021 , s(\u03c8)]) for \u03c8 \u2208 CA2 .\nIf r, s were maps of complexes, (A.1) would be promoted to a split exact\nsequence of complexes, and in that case (A.2) would reduce to a short exact\nsequence. It is readily seen however that r and s are not necessarily maps of\ncomplexes, and the following modification must be made. In general we can\ntruncate (A.2) as\n0\n\nH(Ker(g))/Im(\u03b4)\n/\n\n/\n\nH(CA1 )\n\n/ H(CA\n\n2\n\n)\n/\n\nIm(\u03b4)\n/\n\n0 . (A.3)\n\nBy the split property of (A.1) we observe that\nIm(\u03b4) = (Im([\u22021 , * ]) \u2229 Ker(g))/Im([\u22021 , * ])|Ker(g) ,\nand hence (A.3) becomes\n0\n/\n\nH(CA1 ) \u2229 Ker(g)\n/\n\nH(CA1 )\n/\n\nH(CA2 )\n/\n\nIm(\u03b4)\n/\n\n0\n\nGenerically this does not simplify, in contrast to the case of the complexes of\nendomorphisms End(TAi ). Here the corresponding inverse maps r and s are\nmaps of complexes and the long exact sequence reduces to\n0\n/\n\nH(End(TA1 )) \u2229 Ker(g)\n/\n\nH(End(TA1 ))\n/\n\nH(End(TA2 ))\n/\n\n0.\n\nThe computation in (3.14) then shows that H(End(TA1 )) \u2229 Ker(g) = 0 and we\nrecover H(End(TA1 )) \u223c\n= H(End(TA2 )), i. e. M11 : End(TA1 ) \u2192 End(TA2 ) is a\nquasi-isomorphism.\n\n33\n\n\fA.4. The off-shell to on-shell deformation retraction\nHere we will prove proposition 3.7. That F\u0304 must be of the form (3.20) follows by\napplying \u03c0H to\nidTA \u2212 F F\u0304 = [\u2202, U] .\n(A.4)\nF\u0304 is then automatically an A\u221e -morphism by\nF (\u2202eF\u0304 \u2212 F\u0304 \u2202) = [\u2202, F F\u0304 ] = \u2212[\u2202, \u2202U + U\u2202] = 0\n\nand the injectivity of F . Next we show that (3.18) is compatible with (A.4):\n\u2206(idTA \u2212 F F\u0304 ) = \u2206(\u2202U + U\u2202)\n1\n= (\u2202 \u2297 idTA + idTA \u2297 \u2202)(U \u2297 (idTA + F F\u0304 ) + (idTA + F F\u0304 ) \u2297 U)\n2\n1\n+ (U \u2297 (idTA + F F\u0304 ) + (idTA + F F\u0304 ) \u2297 U)(\u2202 \u2297 idTA + idTA \u2297 \u2202)\n2\n1\n1\n= (idTA \u2212 F F\u0304 ) \u2297 (idTA + F F\u0304 ) + (idTA + F F\u0304 ) \u2297 (idTA \u2212 F F\u0304 )\n2\n2\n+ [\u2202, (idTA + F F\u0304 )] \u2297 U \u2212 U \u2297 [\u2202, (idTA + F F\u0304 )]\n= (idTA \u2212 F F\u0304 \u2297 F F\u0304 )\u2206 = \u2206(idTA \u2212 F F\u0304 )\nwhere in the penultimate step we made use of the fact that [\u2202, F F\u0304 ] = 0 and in\nthe last step we used the fact that F F\u0304 is a coalgebra morphism. This calculation\nshows that if we chose Un1 appropriately, condition (3.18) ensures that U is a\nsolution of (A.4).\nInspection of (A.4) reveals that U11 must be a homotopy for \u220211 , and we can\ntherefore choose U11 = G. For n > 2 we observe that Un1 of the form (3.19)\nsatisfies\n\u03c0B (\u2202U + U\u2202)1n = 0 ,\n(A.5)\nand moreover\n\u03c0L (\u2202U + U\u2202)1n = \u2212\u03c0L (F F\u0304 )1n\n\n(A.6)\n\nholds for n = 2. In order to show that this is also true for n > 2 we proceed\nby induction. We start by substituting (3.19) into the left-hand side of (A.6) to\nobtain\n2\n\u2212G\u220221 (\u220222 Un2 + Un\u22121\n\u2202nn\u22121 + Un2 \u2202nn ) = \u2212G\u220221 (\u2202U + U\u2202)2n = G\u220221 (F F\u0304 )2n = \u2212\u03c0L (F F\u0304 )1n\n\nwhere in the first equality we used the associativity of \u2202, i. e. \u220221 \u220232 = 0. The\nsecond equality is the induction step that is well-defined due to (3.18), while in\nthe third equality we used [\u2202, F F\u0304 ] = 0 and the definition of F from 2.2.\nWe are thus left to verify that F\u0304 is a left inverse of F and that U is in standard\nform. First we give the explicit recursive formulas\n!\nn\u22121\nX\n1\nUn1 = \u2212 G\u220221\n(Ul1 \u2297 (idTA + F F\u0304 )1n\u2212l + (idTA + F F\u0304 )1n\u2212l \u2297 Ul1 ,\n2\nl=1\n\n34\n\n\f1\nF\u0304n1 = \u2212 \u03c0H \u220221\n2\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(Ul1 \u2297 (idTA + F F\u0304 )1n\u2212l + (idTA + F F\u0304 )1n\u2212l \u2297 Ul1\n\nl=1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(A.7)\n\nThe maps Unm for m > 1 are then completely determined by repeated application\nof the coproduct \u2206. Now we show that F\u0304 F = idTA . Since F\u0304 F is a coalgebra\nmorphism, we only need to consider the subset of equations\n(F\u0304 F )1n = (idTH )1n .\n\n(A.8)\n\nClearly the above is satisfied for n = 1. For n > 1, F\u03041k Fkn vanishes at k = 1 due\nto Im(Fn1 ) \u2282 L \u2282 Ker(\u03c0H ). While for k > 1 it vanishes because from (A.7) we\nsee that each summand in F\u0304n1 has at least one factor proportional to G. However\neach tensor factor of each summand is in Im(Fk1 ) \u2282 H \u2295 L = Ker(G).\nThat U is in standard form, i. e. F\u0304 U = 0, UF = 0 and UU = 0, follows from\nan argument in direct analogy to the above proof for F\u0304 .\nThe above proof is easily extended to the case where (A, \u2202)\n\u0001\nPnis an1 arbitrary\nk\n1\n1\n\u2202\nU\nfrom\nA\u221e -algebra by replacing the formula\nfor\nU\nwith\nU\n=\n\u2212G\nn\nn\nn\nk\nk=2\n\u0001\nPn\n1 k\nwhich it follows that F\u0304n1 = \u2212\u03c0H\n\u2202\nU\n.\nk=2 k n\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
