Here we present Gemini North ALTAIR/NIFS laserguide star adaptive-optics assisted K-band integral-field spectroscopy of W33A and\nits inner reflection nebula. In our data we make the first detections of a rotationallyflattened outer envelope and fast bi-polar jet of a massive YSO at near-infrared wavelengths. The predominant spectral features observed are Br \u03b3, H2 , and a combination\nof emission and absorption from CO gas. We perform a 3-D spectro-astrometric analysis of the line emission, the first study of its kind. We find that the object's Br \u03b3\nemission reveals evidence for a fast bi-polar jet on sub-milliarcsecond scales, which is\naligned with the larger-scale outflow. The hybrid CO features can be explained as a\ncombination of hot CO emission arising in a disk close to the central star, while cold\nCO absorption originates in the cooler outer envelope. Kinematic analysis of these\nfeatures reveals that both structures are rotating, and consistent with being aligned\nperpendicularly to both the ionised jet and the large-scale outflow. Assuming Keplerian rotation, we find that the circumstellar disk orbits a central mass of >10M\n\u2299,\n\u223c\nwhile the outer envelope encloses a mass of \u223c15M \u2299. Our results suggest a scenario\nof a central star accreting material from a circumstellar disk at the centre of a cool\nextended rotating torus, while driving a fast bi-polar wind. These results therefore\nprovide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the formation mechanism\nfor high-mass stars is qualitatively similar to that of low-mass stars.\nKey words: ISM: individual: W33a \u2013 stars: pre-main-sequence \u2013 ISM: Hii regions\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt is still unclear how massive stars (M \u22c6 >\n\u223c 8M \u2299 ) are formed.\nThis is due in part to the rapid formation timescales of such\n5\nstars (<\n\u223c 10 yrs), which mean that the star can reach the\nmain-sequence (MS) while it is still heavily embedded in its\nnatal molecular cloud. Also, it is still unknown how a massive protostar can continue to accrete despite the emmense\noutward radiation pressure it exerts on its surroundings (for\nreviews of massive star formation see e.g. Beuther et al.\n2007; Hoare et al. 2007).\nIt has been suggested that massive stars may form\nthrough a mechanism similar to that of lower mass stars,\nwhereby matter is accreted from a circumstellar disk, with\nthe outward radiative force escaping via the poles and driving a fast bipolar wind. Several numerical studies have\nsucceeded in creating stars with masses >30M\n\u2299 this way\n\u223c\n(e.g. Yorke & Sonnhalter 2002; Krumholz et al. 2009), while\n\nit has been shown that the fast bipolar winds should\nstrongly influence the infalling material from the envelope\n(Parkin et al. 2009). The observational evidence to support this scenario however is limited and circumstantial.\nThe CO bandhead emission at 2.3\u03bcm has been modelled\nas arising in a circumstellar disk (e.g. Chandler et al. 1993,\n1995; Bik & Thi 2004a; Blum et al. 2004); large-scale bipolar outflows have been observed to originate from heavily\nembedded objects (e.g. Beuther et al. 2002); and some authors have found evidence of accretion disks in individual\nmassive protostars (Patel et al. 2005; Beltr\u00e1n et al. 2006;\nTorrelles et al. 2007).\nMassive Young Stellar Objects (MYSOs) are thought\nto represent the phase in a massive star's formation immediately before the star reaches the main-sequence (MS) but\nwhilst it is still accreting, and as such are important objects\nwith which to study the formation of massive stars.

The NIFS field-of-view is indicated by the white box. Our sky field is indicated by\nthe black box in the lower-right of the image. The natural guide star, used in the tip-tilt correction stage of the adaptive optics system,\nis indicated by the black circle.\n\nis a well-known MYSO. It lies at a distance of \u223c3.8kpc and\nhas a source luminosity of \u223c105 L\u2299 (Fa\u00fandez et al. 2004). It\nis deeply embedded (e.g. Gibb et al. 2000), but is visible in\nthe K band despite this. The morphology of the object's\nlarge-scale nebula suggests a bipolar outflow, but as yet no\nconvincing evidence exists for an accretion disk or a bipolar\nwind close to the central star. The object's weak radio emission has only been marginally resolved at radio wavelengths\n(Rengarajan & Ho 1996; van der Tak & Menten 2005). The\nclose environment of W33A has been probed using mid-IR\ninterferometry (de Wit et al. 2007, de Wit et al, 2009, submitted), with the visibilities well fitted by a model in which\nthe emission arises in the warm dusty envelope close to the\nsurface of the cavity created by a bipolar outflow.\nTo provide a detailed study of W33A's inner nebula,\nand ultimately to investigate the physical processes occuring in the formation of the central star, in this paper we\npresent high spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy of\nW33A. These data allow us to study the spatial variations in\nemission from the ionised outflow, the dense, hot molecular\n\nmaterial close to the star, and the cooler molecular material\nin the object's inner envelope and outflow.\nWe begin in Sect. 2 with a description of the observations and data reduction steps. We present the results of\nthe data in Sect. 3, and provide a discussion in Sect. 4. We\nconclude in Sect. 5.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS & DATA REDUCTION\nObservations\n\nIn Fig. 1 we show the wide-field K-band image of the\nW33A region taken from the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey (Lucas et al. 2008). The image clearly shows what appears to be a large-scale outflow extending \u223c0.8\u2032 towards\nthe south-east at a position-angle (PA) measured to be\n(135\u00b15)\u25e6 . Diffuse emission is also seen to the north-west\nof the flux peak, which may be the opposite lobe of the outflow. A velocity resolved 12 CO map of this region conclusively shows that the material is outflowing from the central\nsource (see Fig. 2 of de Wit et al., submitted).\n\n\fThe disk, envelope & outflow of W33A\nOur data were taken using the Gemini Near-infrared\nIntegral Field Spectrograph (NIFS, McGregor et al. 2003)\non the nights of 16 April and 25 May 2008. The observations\nwere pointed such that the bright flux centre was at the\nnorthern edge of the instrument field-of-view, in order to\nobtain data on the base of the outflow as well as the central\nsource. The instrument applies the image-slicing technique\nto separate the 3\u2032\u2032 \u00d73\u2032\u2032 field-of-view into 29 slices, which are\nthen aligned on the detector and passed through a diffraction\ngrating. We employed the K grating in combination with\nthe HK filter and central wavelength set at 2.2\u03bcm. This\nsetup achieved a spectral resolution of R \u2248 5300 over the\nwavelength range 2.0-2.4\u03bcm across the full NIFS field-ofview.\nOur observations made use of the Gemini ALTAIR\nlaser-guide star (LGS) adaptive optics system. The system\nuses a natural guide star for tip-tilt correction, and the laser\nguide star for wavefront sensing. For tip-tilt correction we\nused the star 2UCAC-25155527, which has mUC = 14.6 and\nis located 6.9\u2032\u2032 from the centre of our field-of-view (see Fig.\n1).\nThe observational strategy involved observing the target and neighbouring sky in an ABBA pattern, the location\nof the sky field is shown in Fig. 1. The integration time per\nindividual observation was 180s, with each integration readout in the faint mode setting of 16 non-destructive reads.\nA total of 7 separate integrations were used, giving a total\nintegration time of \u223c20mins. In addition to the science target, we observed the A0 V double HR6798 to characterize\nthe telluric absorption. The GCAL calibration unit was used\nto take continuum lamp observations plus associated dark\nframes for flat-fielding purposes. Argon-Xenon arc exposures\nwere obtained for wavelength calibration, as well as ronchi\nflats which are used to characterize the spatial distortion of\nNIFS data.\n\n2.2\n\nData reduction\n\nThe preliminary stages of data-reduction were done using\nthe Gemini instrument-specific pipeline which runs on the\niraf platform. Science observations had their associated sky\nframes subtracted to remove the dark current and sky emission lines. The data were then divided through by the normalized flat-field to correct for pixel-to-pixel variations in\nsensitivity, and any bad pixels flagged in the earlier reduction steps were interpolated over. The arc and ronchi flat\nframes were used to derive the transformation matrix of the\n2-dimensional 'sliced' image onto a 3-dimensional (x, y, \u03bb)\ndatacube. The application of this transformation rectifies\nthe data both spatially and spectrally, and it is at this step\nthat the wavelength calibration is applied.\nRemoval of telluric absorption and combination of the\nindividual datacubes was done in IDL, using custom-written\nroutines and the GSFC IDL library1 . Correction for the Br \u03b3\nabsorption in the telluric standard was done by dividing\nthrough by a synthetic AO V template spectrum, interactively altering the centroid and absorption strength of the\nBr \u03b3 feature in the template until a satisfactory match to\n\n1\n\nhttp://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Image of the A0 v double HR6798A+B, illustrating the\nperformance of the ALTAIR-LGS adaptive optics system during\nthe observations. Contours show the encircled energy at 68% and\n95% of the total flux. The FWHM was measured as 0.13\u2032\u2032 .\n\nthe standard star was found. At each spatial pixel of the science datacube, the spectrum was extracted and divided by\nthe telluric standard. If the spectrum had sufficient signalto-noise (i.e. over \u223c100 counts in the continuum) the two\nspectra were first cross-correlated to achieve optimal telluric\ncorrection, particularly important in the region of the OH\nabsorption lines at 2.0-2.1\u03bcm where sub-pixel misalignments\ncan introduce artifacts into the spectrum.\nThe individual science datacubes of repeat observations\nwere spatially aligned by first taking the median image of\neach cube across all spectral pixels, then cross-correlating\nthese median images with one another. We then took the\nsum of the spectra at each spatial pixel, using the median of\nthese spectra as a template from which to reject any further\nbad pixels and cosmic-ray hits.\n\n2.3\n\nAdaptive optics performance\n\nIn order to illustrate the spatial resolution of the data and\nthe PSF correction that was achieved through the ALTAIR\nadaptive optics system, in Fig. 2 we show the wavelengthintegrated image of the telluric standard stars HR6798A+B.\nTo better demonstrate the shape and size of the corrected\nPSF, the image was first split into two, with each sub-image\ncontaining one star. The sub-images were normalized such\nthat the corrected flux from each star was the same, then the\nsub-images were recombined. On the image we have drawn\ncontours indicating 67% and 95% encircled energy. While\nthe star to the north appears slightly elliptical, the southern\nstar is circular to within the errors. For each star we find 67%\nof the PSF flux is contained within a radius of \u22480.15\u2032\u2032 of the\nflux centre. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of each\nstar was measured to be 0.13\u2032\u2032 .\n\n\f4\n\nB. Davies et al.\n\nFigure 4. Spatial profile of the flux centroid of W33A when\ncompared to the average profile of the two standard stars. While\nthe profiles in the x-direction are similar, the y-profile of W33A\nis noticably extended in comparison to the standard.\nFigure 3. NIFS K-band image of W33A when integrated over\nall spectral channels, with North up and East to the left. The\nimage is scaled in units of sigma above the background, estimated\nfrom the NW corner of the field. The location of maximum flux\nis labelled 'A', and the other four bright knots of emission are\nlabelled 'B'-'E'.\n\n2.4\n\nVariations in spectral resolution and\nwavelength calibration\n\nThe accuracy of the wavelength calibration and the consistency of spectral resolution was determined from analysis\nof datacubes constructed from the arc lamp observations.\nFor each arc line that was used to determine the wavelength\nsolution we fitted gaussian line profiles, and measured the\nline-width and velocity offset. We found that the absolute\nwavelength calibration had a root-mean-square standard deviation of \u00b14 km s\u22121 across the field-of-view, with no discernable trends with spatial position. The spectral resolution\nwas similarly found to be \u2206v = 55\u00b14 km s\u22121 across the field,\nagain having no trend with spatial position, other than that\nit was systematically poorer by \u223c6 km s\u22121 in the south-east\n0.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d70.5\u2032\u2032 region. As very little data was used from this region, we did not correct for this effect.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTable 1. Equivalent widths of the atomic emission lines. The\nuncertainty on EW was measured from fluctuations in the continuum.\n\nRESULTS\nNebular morphology\n\nIn Fig. 3 we show the total two-dimensional image when the\ndatacube is summed across all wavelength channels. The\ncentral source is not a point-source, and instead is noticeably extended in the north-south direction (see Fig. 4). In\nparticular, we see a bright central peak (labelled 'A' in Fig.\n3) and a 'finger' pointing southward (labelled as 'B'). The\n'L'-shaped inner nebula, which can be marginally resolved\nin the UKIDSS K-band image and which forms the base of\nthe outflow, is resolved in our data into three bright knots of\nemission, which we label 'C', 'D' and 'E'. As we show later,\nthe emission from these knots is predominantly scattered\nlight.\n\n3.2\n\nLine\n\n\u03bbvac\n\nEW (\u00c5)\n\nBr \u03b3\nMg ii\nMg ii\nNa i\nNa i\n\n2.1662\n2.1374\n2.1438\n2.2062\n2.2090\n\n-5.00\u00b10.17\n-0.43\u00b10.17\n-0.24\u00b10.17\n-0.50\u00b10.17\n-0.37\u00b10.17\n\nSpatial variations of spectral properties\n\nThe unique feature of IFU data is that it is possible to chart\nthe variations of the observed spectral properties across the\nfield of view. We begin in this section with a description\nof the principle spectral features, followed by an analysis of\nhow these features vary with spatial position.\nIn Fig. 5 we plot the spectrum of the bright central\nsource extracted from region A (see Fig. 3). The steeplyrising continuum indicates that the central source is heavily\nreddened. In order to highlight the spectral features, in the\nbottom panel of the figure we show the spectrum when normalized by a 4th-degree polynomial fit to the continuum\n(labelled as 'region A' in the Figure). In this normalised\nspectrum we see emission features of Br \u03b3, H2 , Na i and the\nCO 2-0, 3-1, 4-2 and 5-3 bandheads. Also seen are narrow\nabsorption lines in the region of the CO bandheads, attributable to low J transitions of the CO v=2-0 state, as\nwell as a broad absorption feature around 2.28\u03bcm which we\nattribute to CH3 OH ice (also observed in this object's spectrum by Taban et al. 2003). We do not confirm the presence\nof He i emission detected by Taban et al. (2003), while there\nis a suggestion of emission from the Mg ii doublet at 2.14\u03bcm.\nTable 1 shows the measured equivalent widths of the atomic\nemission lines as measured from the region A aperture.\n\n\fThe disk, envelope & outflow of W33A\n\n5\n\nFigure 5. Spectrum of region A, and the ratio of region A's spectrum to that of the average background spectrum. The top panel\nshows the spectra before continuum fitting, to illustrate the high degree of reddening. The bottom panel shows the spectra after dividing\nthrough by fits to the continua, to highlight the discrete spectral features.\n\n3.2.1\n\nSpectrum of the central source versus surrounding\nnebula\n\nTo analyse spectral differences between region A and the rest\nof the field, we have created an average 'background' spectrum by integrating over all spatial pixels in the observed\nfield except those in region A. In the top panel of Fig. 5 we\nhave also plotted the ratio of the region A spectrum to this\nbackground spectrum, labelled 'region A/background'. The\ncontinuum of this ratio spectrum is shallower than that of\nthe central source, which is to be expected if the emission\nin the southern nebula is predominantly scattered light.\nIn the bottom panel of Fig. 5 we plot the ratio of the\nspectra when normalized by a continuum fit. Here the emission due to Br \u03b3, Na i, Mg ii and CO disappears, suggesting that the emission morphologies of these features follow\nthat of the continuum, i.e. they are also scattered. The H2\nlines go into 'absorption' indicating that this emission originates mainly in the surrounding nebula rather than on the\nbright source at region A. The CH3 OH and CO absorption\nare still seen in the residual spectrum, implying that there\nis an increased level of opacity due to these features along\nthe line-of-sight to region A compared with the surrounding\nnebula.\n\n3.2.2\n\nVariations in continuum emission\n\nIn the previous section we showed that the slope of the Kband continuum emission is not uniform across the field. To\n\nFigure 6. Three-colour image of the continuum emission. Each\nRGB channel is scaled linearly, while the dynamic ranges were\nchosen arbitrarily to best illustrate the contrast between region\nA and the southern nebula.\n\nfurther illustrate the spatial variations in continuum emission we created narrow band continuum images at three\nfeatureless regions of the spectrum: 2.083\u03bcm, 2.185\u03bcm, and\n\n\f6\n\nB. Davies et al.\n\nFigure 7. Left: Image of the continuum-subtracted line flux of Br \u03b3. The images are scaled in units of sigma above the background,\nmeasured from the north-west corner of the image. The overplotted contours show the continuum emission and are drawn at 20\u03c3, 30\u03c3,\n40\u03c3, 50\u03c3, 70\u03c3, 100\u03c3 and 200\u03c3 above the background. Right: Same as the left-hand figure but for the first CO bandhead at 2.293\u03bcm.\n\n2.273\u03bcm, each with a bandwidth of \u00b10.003\u03bcm. These images\nwere then combined into an RGB image, with the shortest wavelength image assigned to the blue channel and the\nlongest to the red. The resulting image is shown in Fig. 6.\nIn the image, the southern nebula is seen predominantly\nin 'blue' light (i.e. the shortest wavelength), while the central\nsource appears red. This behaviour can be understood as a\ncombination of scattering and extinction. The central source\nat region A is heavily absorbed, making the direct light from\nregion A appear red. Meanwhile, the emission to the south\nis mostly light from region A which has been scattered, and\nso appears blue.\n\n3.2.3\n\nThe Br \u03b3 and CO emission\n\nIn this section we map the spatial morphology of the emission due to Br \u03b3 and CO (the CO absorption is studied in\nSect. 3.2.6). First we subtract the continuum at each spatial\npixel of the datacube by fitting a 4th-degree polynomial to\nfeatureless regions of the continuum. We then integrate the\nemission across the spectral feature in question. For the CO\nemission, we took only the bright blue edge of the first bandhead (2.293-2.300\u03bcm) \u2013 this feature contains the majority\nof the flux, and is uncontaminated by the low-J absorption\nlines.\nThe continuum-subtracted emission images of Br \u03b3 and\nCO are shown in Fig. 7. Both images display morphology\nsimilar to that of the continuum image (traced by the contours), with each of the five emission knots clearly visible.\nIt is unlikely that the extended Br \u03b3 and CO emission is\nformed 'in-situ' in the southern parts of the nebula, as the\ntwo spectral features require different temperatures and densities. It is far more likely that in the southern nebula, as\nwith the continuum emission, we are seeing scattered light\nwhich originates within a few AU of the central source.\nIn Fig. 8 we further explore the scattered light explanation for the Br \u03b3 and CO emission by taking the ratio of\n\nFigure 8. The ratio image of the continuum-subtracted Br \u03b3 and\nCO emission. Contours are the same as those shown in Fig. 7.\n\nthe two continuum-subtracted images. If the emission in the\nsouthern nebula attributable to these transitions is due to\nscattering by material in the outflow, we should in principle\nsee very little morphological difference between the emission\nmorphologies. Figure 8 shows that no features corresponding\nto the southern nebula are seen in the ratio image. Instead,\nwe see a slight increase in the ratio of Br \u03b3 to CO in the\nsouthern regions compared that around region A. This can\nbe understood as a combination of the wavelength dependence of scattering, which boosts the Br \u03b3/CO ratio in the\nsouth, and extinction by dense material around the central\nsource, which attenuates Br \u03b3 with respect to CO around\nregion A.\n\n\fThe disk, envelope & outflow of W33A\n\n7\n\nFigure 9. The variations of the Br \u03b3 spectral feature across the five bright knots of emission identified in Fig. 3. The mean of the five\nspectra is overplotted as a dotted line. The dashed line indicates W33A's systemic velocity.\n\nFigure 10. The variations of the CO feature across the five bright knots of emission identified in Fig. 3.\n\n3.2.4\n\nVariations in line-profile with viewing-angle\n\nAs we have shown in previous sections, the line-emission observed in the southern nebula is most likely scattered light\nwhich orginates at the flux centre (i.e. region A). We can\nthen use this scattered light to study the emission from the\ncentral source as viewed by the southern nebula, when compared to viewing the emission directly from region A. In\neffect, this allows us to study the line-profiles as a function\nof viewing angle. This is a technique we have previously\nused to study the wind geometry of the evolved massive\nstar IRC +10420 (Davies et al. 2007).\nWe explore the spatial variations of Br \u03b3 and CO in\nFigs. 9 and 10, where we plot the integrated spectra of the\nfive bright knots of emission identified in Fig. 3 as A-E.\nIn respect to the Br \u03b3 emission, there is very little variation across the five regions. The regions show evidence for\nP Cygni absorption, and perhaps an extended red wing. The\nequivalent widths (EWs) of the profiles in the southern nebula are slightly larger than those of regions A and B. As\nthe Br \u03b3 emission in the southern nebula is most likely scattered light, these small changes in EW are possibly due to\nanisotropy in the ionized circumstellar gas.\nThe CO emission shows clear variations across the observed field. To highlight this in Fig. 11 we plot the spectra\nin the vicinity of the v=2-0 bandhead. The blue edge appears\nshallower in regions A and B, while the edge is much steeper\nin the three southern regions. Also, the transitions between\n2.30-2.305\u03bcm appear to be narrower and more pronounced\nin the southern knots (C, D and E) than in those close to\n\nregion A. This suggests that the CO emission, when viewed\ndirectly through the bright central source at region A, has\na broadened velocity profile with respect to the profile reflected from the southern nebula. As the southern nebula's\nviewing angle to the central source is different from our direct line of sight to the same region, this suggests that the\nCO profile's broadening is a function of the viewing angle.\nSuch behaviour is typically attributed to the emission forming in a disk (Bik & Thi 2004a; Blum et al. 2004). As the\nmaterial in the southern nebula 'sees' less rotational broadening than our direct line-of-sight, the orientation of the\ndisk is consistent with being aligned perpendicularly to the\nlarger-scale outflow.\n\n3.2.5\n\nSpectro-astrometry of Br \u03b3\n\nHere we investigate the small-scale geometry of the Br \u03b3\nemission by performing a 3-D spectro-astrometric analysis\nof the Br \u03b3 line. At each wavelength channel of the datacube we extracted a 2-D image and determined the astrometric centroid of the emission at region A. This method\ncan give spatial information on extremely small scales \u2013 the\nastrometric accuracy on the centroid is roughly equivalent\nto \u2206 \u223c FWHM/SNR. So, for the spatial resolution of our\nobservations (0.13\u2032\u2032 ) and a SNR at region A of several hundred, in principle we can expect to achieve accuracies of\norder of a tenth of a milliarcsecond. In order to verify this\nwe performed spectro-astrometric tests on the data from\nthe telluric standards. We found that indeed the r.m.s. on\nthe centroid position was of order 0.1mas. We tried different\n\n\f8\n\nB. Davies et al.\n\nFigure 11. Spectra of the five regions identified in Fig. 3 around the CO v=2-0 bandhead. For clarity, spectra have been interpolated\nonto a finer grid. It is clear from this figure that the line profiles of C, D and E are narrower and more pronounced than those of A and\nB.\n\nFigure 12. Spectro-astrometry across the Br \u03b3 emission line. (Left): the bottom panel shows the intensity spectrum of region A, while\nthe top panel shows the astrometric position of the centroid flux peak as a function of wavelength. The red line, labelled 'DEC', shows\nthe centroid position in the y-direction, while the black line ('RA') shows the position in the x-direction. (Right): the same data as in\nthe left-hand panel, but represented in x \u2212 y space. The symbols are colour-coded to show the velocity at each point. The dotted line\nshows the position-angle of the red and blue high-velocity components.\n\nmethods of centroiding, including flux-weighted centroiding,\nfinding the location at which the derivatives go to zero and\nfitting 2-D gaussian profiles. All techniques were found to\ngive similar results within the errors. In addition we observed\nno artifacts around the telluric absorption lines, and no excursions across the telluric standard star's intrinsic Br \u03b3 absorption, as is to be expected (see Appendix A).\nIn the left panel of Fig. 12 we plot the position of\nthe centroid as a function of wavelength in the region of\nBr \u03b3. The spectro-astrometric profiles have had any largescale gradients removed by fitting a 3rd-degree polynomial\nto the continuum. Firstly, we note that the astrometric ac-\n\ncuracy of the centroid, as judged by the continuum regions,\nis comparable to that predicted (0.1-0.2mas), corresponding\nto a physical scale of 0.4-0.8AU for a systemic distance of\n3.8kpc. Secondly, the centroid shows a clear shift in the region of Br \u03b3. In the north-south direction (labelled 'DEC'\nin the figure), the centroid appears to shift south slightly in\nthe region of the P Cygni absorption, before shifting northwards by \u223c1 mas. Similarly, in the east-west direction (labelled 'RA', where the positive direction is eastward), there\nis a slight shift to the east coincident with the P Cygni absorption, followed by an excursion to the west of \u223c0.5mas.\nThis behaviour is illustrated again in the right panel of\n\n\fThe disk, envelope & outflow of W33A\nFig. 12. This time, the centroid is plotted in RA-DEC space\nwith colour-coded symbols to indicate the velocity of each\npoint. The location of the continuum centroid is illustrated\nby the cross. The plot shows that the emission with the\nlargest red-shifted velocities (\u223c400 km s\u22121 ) is located to the\nnorth-west of the continuum location, while the emission\nblue-shifted by a similar amount is located to the southeast of the continuum, indicating expansion. From analysis\nof those points with speeds between 300-400 km s\u22121 we find\nthat the statistical significance of the red- and blue-shifted\npoints being spatially separated from the continuum is 2.8\u03c3\nand 4.1\u03c3 respectively. In addition to this behaviour there\nis a large excursion across the centre of the line with |v| <\n100 km s\u22121 .\nThe observed behaviour can be explained if we make\nthe assumption that the Br \u03b3 emission line is made up of\ntwo or more components. The broad high-velocity emission\noriginates in an axisymmetric structure, most likely a bipolar jet, while the narrow low velocity emission is formed\nin an extended structure such as a small, dense Hii-region.\nThe nature of this narrow emission is difficult to disentangle, but it is possible that it is formed in an aspherical\nclumpy medium with much velocity-dependent extinction\nand self-absorption. This is similar to the picture deduced\nby Drew et al. (1993) and Bunn et al. (1995) from velocityresolved line-profile ratios.\nIn addition to the detection of an outflow, the spectroastrometric data also indicate that the bright flux maximum\nobserved in the integrated image is indeed the location of the\ncentral star.\nFor the broad-line component of the emission we can\nmeasure the PA of this structure by taking the data at\n300 < |v/km s\u22121 | < 400 and taking the mean positions of\nthe red- and blue-shifted components. We measure the PA\nof this structure to be 113\u00b125\u25e6 (see right panel of Fig. 12),\nand so is aligned with the large-scale outflow seen in Fig. 1\n(PA=135\u00b15\u25e6 ). From the alignment of these angles it is likely\nthat in this small-scale structure we are seeing the base of\na bi-polar ionized wind or jet. In addition, the blue-shifted\nportion of the Br \u03b3 emission is oriented towards the southeast, consistent with the hypothesis that the outflow seen\nin the wide-field image is the lobe coming towards us, while\nthe red-shifted lobe to the north-west is largely obscured.\nThe outflow velocity, as measured from Fig. 12, appears\nto be around voutflow cos i \u223c 300 km s\u22121 . Assuming an inclination of 60\u25e6 (de Wit et al., 2009 submitted), this gives an\noutflow velocity measured from Br \u03b3 of \u223c600 km s\u22121 . This\nis likely an underestimate of the outflow's terminal velocity, as a large fraction of the Br \u03b3 emission may form in\nthe accelarating part of the wind. This value is consistent\nwith MYSO jet velocities measured by radio proper motion\nstudies (Marti et al. 1998; Curiel et al. 2006).\n3.2.6\n\nThe CO absorption\n\nThe low-J transistions of the CO v=2-0 state are observed\nin absorption in W33A's spectrum (Sect. 3.2). The population of these states requires much cooler conditions (\u223c30 K)\nthan that of the high-J states seen in emission (few \u00d71000 K)\n(Chandler et al. 1993, 1995; Bik & Thi 2004a). Therefore\nthese two distinct spectral features must arise in different\nregions \u2013 the CO bandhead emission likely originates in ma-\n\n9\n\nFigure 13. Image of the datacube integrated over the CO absorption lines. The image is scaled in units of sigma below the\ncontinuum flux level, where sigma is measured from the southern\nnebula.\n\nterial close to the central star; while the absorption lines are\nformed in the outer envelope at several thousand AU (see\nlater).\nThe right-hand panel of Fig. 9 shows that the CO absorption lines vary in strength between the bright central\nsource (A) and the southern regions (C, D and E). Specifically, the absorption is stronger towards region A than the\nsouthern nebula. To explore this behaviour further, subcubes were extracted from the primary data-cube, each containing the full spatial information of one of these absorption\nlines. We observed a behaviour which was similar for each\nline and so all lines were combined to increase the signal-tonoise.\nIn Fig. 13 we show the image obtained when the datacube is integrated over these features. The image shows\nthat the CO absorption is concentrated around region A\nin a band extending roughly east-west, and is perpendicular to the large-scale outflow. Significantly less absorption is\nseen in the southern nebula, indicating that the material in\nthe southern regions sees less obscuring material than our\ndirect line-of-sight to region A. This suggests that the envelope has the morphology of a torus, with a physical radius of\n\u223c2000 AU, and with an opening to the south through which\nthe outflow escapes.\nFigure 14 shows the measured velocity centroid of the\nCO absorption at each spatial position across the extinction\nstructure seen in Fig. 13. The image has been smoothed by\na boxcar filter of width 5 pixels to highlight any velocity\ngradient. At negative (blue-shifted) velocities, the opacity\nappears to be concentrated in a region about 0.2-0.3\u2032\u2032 east\nof the centre of the bright source (i.e. region A). At positive\n(red-shifted) velocities however, there is a clear shift in the\nlocation of the opacity centre to a region 0.1-0.2\u2032\u2032 west of\nregion A. No apparent trends with velocity are seen in the\nsouthern regions of the nebula, though the data are very\nnoisy and are not shown in the figure. We determined the\n\n\fB. Davies et al.\n\n10\n\nFigure 14. The velocity centroid of the CO absorption lines as\na function of spatial position across the field. Velocities are indicated only for those absorption lines which have strengths greater\nthan 5\u03c3 below the continuum. The data has been smoothed with a\nboxcar filter of width 5 pixels (0.25\u2032\u2032 ) to accentuate the regions of\nmaximum and minimum velocity. Dotted lines indicate the rough\nposition angle of the structure.\n\nPA of rotation to be 60\u00b110\u25e6 by fitting the blue and red\nflux peaks in Fig. 14. This is therefore consistent with being\nperpedicular to the larger scale outflow of PA=135\u00b15\u25e6 . The\nPA of this feature is perpendicular to the large scale outflow\nobserved in Fig. 1, as well as to the small-scale outflow seen\nin the spectro-astrometric analysis of the Br \u03b3 emission. As\nwith the broadening of the CO bandhead emission described\nin the previous section, the observed behaviour is indicative\nof an extended rotating structure seen edge-on. The kinematics of this feature are explored further in Sect. 4.\n\n3.2.7\n\nMolecular hydrogen\n\nThe light of H2 2.12\u03bcm shows a very different morphology\nto that of the continuum and the Br \u03b3 and CO emission\n(see Fig. 15). The emission is concentrated to the south-east\nof region A, while very little H2 emission is seen at region\nA itself. The other H2 lines observed in the spectrum display similar behaviour, though have much poorer signal-tonoise and so are not shown. The orientation of this emission,\nextending roughly south-eastwards of region A, is approximately coincident with that of the base of the large-scale\noutflow seen in the wide-field image of Fig. 1.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION \u2013 CO KINEMATICS, AND THE\nMASS OF THE CENTRAL OBJECT\n\nThe pieces of evidence presented above are all consistent\nwith the qualitative picture of a massive forming star in\nwhich the central object is surrounded by a rotating disk\nfrom which it is accreting. A rotationally-flattened envelope\nsurrounds the central star and its disk, while the star drives\na fast bi-polar wind.\nIn this section we present a kinematic analysis of the\nCO bandhead emission and the low-J CO absorption lines\n\nFigure 15. Same as Fig. 7 but for H2 2.12\u03bcm. The point-like\nemission at the very centre of region A is possibly due to poor\ncontinuum subtraction.\n\nand use them to derive the mass of the object about which\nthey rotate.\n\n4.1\n\nThe bandhead broadening\n\nAs shown in Fig. 11, the CO bandhead emission lines appear\nto be broader towards region 'A' than those observed in the\nsouthern nebula. This behaviour can be attributed to a flattened rotating structure (i.e. a disk) which is seen at lower\ninclination when viewed directly than when seen reflected by\nthe nebula to the south. If we assume the extreme case that\n(a) the line-of-sight 'A' views the disk edge-on, and (b) that\nthe southern nebula views the disk pole-on, by convolving\nthe profile seen from the southern nebula until it matches\nthat at 'A' we can estimate a lower limit to the disk rotation\nspeed. By assuming Keplerian rotation we can then estimate\nthe mass of the central object about which the disk rotates.\nIn Fig. 16 we plot the CO bandhead profile seen at 'A'.\nWe also plot the profile seen in the southern nebula (region\n'C') which has been convolved with a rotational broadening function of the form \u03c8(v) \u223c [1 \u2212 (v/Vrot )2 ]1/2 , where\nv is velocity and Vrot is the disk rotational velocity. The\nbest match to the blue-edge of the bandhead, as well as\nthe lower-J line profiles, is found when the rotational velocity is 50\u00b15 km s\u22121 . If the direct line-of-sight is not exactly\nedge-on, and/or if the orientation of the reflected light is not\nexactly pole-on, the disk rotation speed will be greater than\nthis value. By taking the inclination angle recently derived\nby de Wit et al. (submitted) of 60\u00b120\u25e6 (i.e. 30\u25e6 away from\nbeing edge-on), we can further constrain the disk rotation\n\u22121\nspeed to 64+22\n.\n\u22128 km s\nAssuming that the disk rotation is Keplerian, and that\nthe CO emission arises in a narrow annulus at a fixed radius\nR from the central object we can now derive a mass of the\ncentral object Mc from,\nMc = RV 2 /G\n\n(1)\n\n\fThe disk, envelope & outflow of W33A\n\n11\n\nFigure 16. The observed profile of the CO bandhead in region 'A' (black solid line), as well as the profile seen in the southern nebula\n(from region 'C') when convolved with a PSF of various widths.\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant. Bik & Thi (2004b)\nwho found that the CO typically forms at a distance from\nthe central star of 1-3AU. Using R = 2\u00b11AU, and a distance\nto W33A of 3.8kpc (Fa\u00fandez et al. 2004), we find that the\nlower limit to the central mass is Mc = 10+9\n\u22125 M \u2299 .\n\n4.2\n\n2 MO\u2022\n10 MO\u2022\n30 MO\u2022\n\nThe absorption-line velocity structure\n\nIn Sect. 3.2.6 we showed that the absorption lines of CO appear to be formed in a rotating structure coincident with region A, and measured the PA of this structure to be 60\u00b110\u25e6 .\nIn Fig. 17 we show a position-velocity slice across the averaged CO datacube at a PA of 60\u25e6 . The data shows the classical signature of a Keplerian rotating structure. To help\nillustrate this, overplotted are models of Keplerian rotation\nfor three different central masses and with an assumed distance of 3.8kpc (Fa\u00fandez et al. 2004). Each curve has been\nconvolved with the spatial resolution of our observations\n(0.13\u2032\u2032 ). A formal least-squares fit to the data yields a central mass of M sin i = 13\u00b12M \u2299 , a result which is insensitive\nto the uncertainty in PA. If we again assume the system inclination is 60\u00b120\u25e6 we find that the outer envelope sees a\ncentral mass of 15+5\n\u22123 M \u2299 . Note that the central mass seen\nby the envelope will include the mass of the envelope itself.\nThis number is very similar to that derived for the central\nmass enclosed by the circumstellar disk, and suggests that\nthe majority of the system's mass is contained within the\ncentral star.\nIf the central object has arrived on the main-sequence,\nthis mass would correspond to a spectral type earlier than\nB1 and a zero-age min-sequence luminosity of log(L/L\u2299 =\n4.3\u00b10.3 (e.g. Meynet & Maeder 2000). This is in good agreement with the latest estimation of W33A's bolometric luminosity from MIPS photometry, log(L/L\u2299 = 4.7 (Mottram\net al. 2009, in prep). The derived spectral-type and luminosity may also explain the detection of the Mg ii emission\nlines. Such lines are typically seen in the spectra of earlyto-mid B supergiants, and are primarily formed in the wind\n(Hanson et al. 2005).

The results can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 In the first 3-D spectro-astrometric study of its kind, we\nhave resolved the Br \u03b3 emission on sub-milliarcsecond scales\n\n\f12\n\nB. Davies et al.\n\n(physical scales <1 AU), and find that the emission geometry is that of a fast bipolar wind which is aligned with the\nlarge-scale outflow seen in wide-field images. The H2 2.12\u03bcm\nemission also traces an outflow with the same orientation out\nto \u223c1\u2032\u2032 .\n\u2022 The extended nebulosity to the south is seen in the\ncontinuum, as well as in the light of Br \u03b3 and CO. We have\nshown that this emission is light reflected by the outflow\nlobe, and so can be used as a 'mirror' with which to observe\nthe emission from the central object from different angles.\n\u2022 We interpret the CO emission as arising in a disk which\nhas a low inclination with respect to our line-of-sight. In the\nsouthern nebula we see light reflected towards us from the\ndisk at a lower inclination angle (i.e. more pole-on), which\ncauses the bandhead profile to be less velocity-broadened.\nThis is consistent with the disk plane being perpendicular\nto the large-scale outflow. The velocity broadnening implies\na lower-limit to the central mass of Mc = 10+9\n\u22125 M \u2299 .\n\u2022 From the low-J v=2-0 transitions of CO at \u223c2.35\u03bcm\nwe find evidence for a rotationally-flattened cool molecular\nenvelope, or 'torus', at a radius of \u223c2000 AU from the central\nstar. The plane of rotation is perpendicular to the small- and\nlarge-scale outflows. Analysis of the velocity structure of the\ntorus indicates that it is rotating about the outflow's axis,\nand that it is orbiting a central mass of 15+5\n\u22123 M \u2299 .\nOur findings suggest a picture of massive star formation within W33A which is in excellent qualitative agreement with the accretion-disk-plus-bipolar wind paradigm.\nAn accretion disk orbits a massive central star, which is\nsurrounded by a cool molecular envelope which has been\nrotationally-flattened into a torus. The central star is driving a bipolar wind, seen on small scales in the ionized gas,\nand on larger scales as molecular / continuum emission. The\ntwo measurements of the central mass indicate that at most\nthe accretion disk makes up \u223c30% of the system, and so the\nsystem mass is dominated by the central star.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nBased on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory,\nwhich is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement\nwith the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), the Science and\nTechnology Facilities Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the\nAustralian Research Council (Australia), Ministrio da Cincia e Tecnologia (Brazil) and Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologa e Innovacin Productiva (Argentina).\n\nREFERENCES\nBeltr\u00e1n, M.

Spectro-astrometry of the Br \u03b3 line for the telluric\nstandard star used in our observations, similar to Fig. 12. The\nlack of artifacts across the telluric features and the star's Br \u03b3\nabsorption, as well as the observed level of astrometric precision\n(\u223c0.2mas), validate the results of the similar analysis of W33A.\n\nYorke, H. W. & Sonnhalter, C. 2002, ApJ, 569, 846\n\nAPPENDIX A: SPECTRO-ASTROMETRY OF\nTHE TELLURIC STANDARD STAR\nIn Fig. A1 we show a spectro-astrometric analysis of the telluric standard star following a similar methodology to that\npresented in Sect. 3.2.5. The intensity spectrum (bottom\npanel) shows the Br \u03b3 absorption line, as well as the many\ntelluric features. The top panel shows the astrometry of the\nstar's flux peak as a function of wavelength, illustrating that\nno discernable variations are seen across neither the Br \u03b3\nline nor the telluric lines. This of course is to be expected,\nand the Figure serves to show that the technique we employ\nproduces no spurious artifacts greater than the noise level\n(\u223c0.2mas) which could be misinterpreted.\n\n13\n\n\f"}
