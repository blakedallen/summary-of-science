Introduction\nIn this paper we present an existence result, proved in [7], for an evolution problem in fracture\nmechanics, and study some very weak regularity properties of the solutions. The mathematical\nformulation of the problem is based on a variational model for quasistatic crack growth developed\nby Francfort and Marigo [11]. The model is based on Griffith's idea [12] that the equilibrium of a\ncrack is determined by the competition between the elastic energy released if the crack grows and\nthe energy dissipated to produce a new portion of crack. This model not only predicts the crack\ngrowth along its path, but also determines the crack path on the basis of an energy criterion, and\ncan also be used to study the process of crack initiation (see [5]).\nThe first mathematical results on this model were obtained in [8] for linear elasticity in the\nantiplane case in dimension two, assuming an a priori bound on the number of connected components of the crack set. This simplifies the mathematical treatment of the problem, but has\nno mechanical justification. These results were extended by Chambolle [4] to the case of plane\nelasticity. A remarkable improvement was obtained by Francfort and Larsen [10], who developed\na weak formulation in the space SBV (\u03a9) of special functions with bounded variation, introduced\nby De Giorgi and Ambrosio [9] to study a wide class of free discontinuity problems. This new\nformulation allows to study the problem in any space dimension, and without any restriction on\nthe number of connected components of the crack sets. The results of [10] deal only with a scalar\ndisplacement field, since the compactness theorem in SBV (\u03a9) requires a bound in L\u221e (\u03a9) that is\nobtained through a truncation argument. Moreover, the techniques used in all papers considered\nso far cannot be extended to the case where exterior volume or surface forces act on the body.\nPreprint SISSA 41/2008/M (June 2008)\n1\n\n\f2\n\nG. DAL MASO, A. GIACOMINI, AND M. PONSIGLIONE\n\nThe result we present here allows to deal with the case of a vector valued deformation field\ndefined in \u03a9 \u2282 Rn with values in Rm , including both the case of antiplane shear (n = 2 and\nm = 1) and n dimensional elasticity (n = m \u2265 2). The bulk energy is not necessarily quadratic,\nalthough the polynomial growth (2.6) excludes, for the moment, the case of genuine finite elasticity.\nMoreover body and surface forces can be considered, under some natural assumptions which\nimply that the deformed body remains in a bounded region even if the cracks split it into several\nconnected components.\nThe variational formulation of the problem presented in this paper is based on the space\nGSBV (\u03a9; Rm ) introduced by De Giorgi and Ambrosio [9], and fits the general framework of\nrate independent evolution problems developed by Mielke [14].\nThe second part of the paper is devoted to the proof of some qualitative properties of the\nsolutions, that are not studied in [7]. We show that, given any quasistatic evolution, we can\nconstruct another quasistatic evolution, whose crack sets are left continuous in time. We also\nprove that the crack set is minimal, in the sense that, at each time t, it is the smallest set\ncontaining all discontinuity sets of the deformation at times s \u2264 t. Moreover, we prove that, given\nany quasistatic evolution, we can construct another quasistatic evolution, with the same crack set,\nwhose deformation is measurable in time. Finally, under some convexity assumptions, we prove\nthat, if the crack set is left continuous, so are the deformation, the deformation gradient, and the\nstress.\n2. The quasistatic crack growth\nIn this section we describe in detail the hypotheses of the quasistatic evolution problem studied\nin [7] and state, without proof, the main existence result of [7].\nThe reference configuration. The reference configuration is a bounded open subset \u03a9 of Rn\nwith Lipschitz boundary. Let \u2202N \u03a9 \u2282 \u2202\u03a9 be closed and let \u2202D \u03a9 := \u2202\u03a9 \\ \u2202N \u03a9. We fix an open\nsubset \u03a9B of \u03a9 with Lipschitz boundary and a closed set \u2202S \u03a9 \u2282 \u2202N \u03a9 such that \u03a9B \u2229 \u2202S \u03a9 = \u00d8.\nThe set \u03a9B represents the brittle part of the body, \u2202D \u03a9 is the part of the boundary where the\ndeformation is prescribed, while the surface forces are applied to \u2202S \u03a9.\nAdmissible cracks. The set of admissible cracks is given by\ne \u03a9B , Hn\u22121 (\u0393) < +\u221e}.\nR(\u03a9B ) := {\u0393 : \u0393 is rectifiable, \u0393 \u2282\n\ne means inclusion up\nHere and henceforth Hn\u22121 is the (n \u2212 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure, \u2282\nto a set of Hn\u22121 -measure zero, while rectifiable\nmeans\nthat\nthere\nexists\na\nsequence (Mi ) of C 1\nS\ne i Mi . If \u0393 is rectifiable, we can define Hn\u22121 -almost\nmanifolds of dimension (n \u2212 1) such that \u0393 \u2282\neverywhere on \u0393 a Borel measurable unit normal vector field \u03bd (see, e.g., [1, Definition 2.86]),\nwhich is unique up to a pointwise choice of the orientation.\nAdmissible deformations. Given a crack \u0393, an admissible deformation is given by any function\ne \u0393. We refer to [1, Chapter 4] for the definitions and properties\nu \u2208 GSBV (\u03a9; Rm ) such that S(u) \u2282\nof the spaces SBV (\u03a9; Rm ) and GSBV (\u03a9; Rm ), as well as for the definition of the jump set S(u),\nof the approximate gradient \u2207u, and of the trace on \u2202\u03a9 of a function u \u2208 GSBV (\u03a9; Rm ). Let us\nfix p > 1 and q > 1. We define\nGSBV p (\u03a9; Rm ) := {u \u2208 GSBV (\u03a9; Rm ) : \u2207u \u2208 Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n ), Hn\u22121 (S(u)) < +\u221e},\nGSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ) := GSBV p (\u03a9; Rm ) \u2229 Lq (\u03a9; Rm ).\nWe say that uk \u21c0 u weakly in GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ) if\nuk \u2192 u in measure on \u03a9,\n(2.1)\n\n\u2207uk \u21c0 \u2207u weakly in Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n ),\nuk \u21c0 u weakly in Lq (\u03a9; Rm ).\n\nThe surface energy. The energy spent to produce a crack \u0393 is given by\nZ\n\u03ba(x, \u03bd(x)) dHn\u22121 (x),\n(2.2)\nE s (\u0393) :=\n\u0393\\\u2202N \u03a9\n\n\fA VARIATIONAL MODEL FOR QUASISTATIC CRACK GROWTH\n\n3\n\nwhere \u03bd is a unit normal vector field on \u0393. Here \u03ba(x, \u03bd(x)) represents the toughness of the material,\nwhich depends on the position x and on the tangent space to the crack, determined by \u03bd(x). Since\nwe are dealing only with brittle cracks, the toughness does not depend on the size of the jump\nof u.\nWe assume that \u03ba : \u03a9B \u00d7Rn \u2192 R is continuous, that \u03ba(x, *) is a norm in Rn for all x \u2208 \u03a9B , and\nthat\n(2.3)\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u03a9B and \u03bd \u2208 Rn ,\n\nK1 |\u03bd| \u2264 \u03ba(x, \u03bd) \u2264 K2 |\u03bd|\n\nwith K1 , K2 > 0. Notice that, since \u03ba is even in the second variable, the integral (2.2) depends\nonly on the geometry of \u0393, and is independent of the choice of the orientation of \u03bd(x).\nThe bulk energy. Let p > 1 be fixed. Given a deformation u \u2208 GSBV p (\u03a9; Rm ) the associated\nbulk energy is given by\nZ\nW (x, \u2207u(x)) dx,\n(2.4)\nW(\u2207u) :=\n\u03a9\n\nwhere W : \u03a9\u00d7Rm\u00d7n \u2192 [0, +\u221e) is a Carath\u00e9odory function satisfying the following conditions:\n(2.5)\n\nW (x, *) is quasiconvex and C 1 on Rm\u00d7n for every x \u2208 \u03a9,\n\n(2.6)\n\np\nW\nW\np\nW\nm\u00d7n\naW\n.\n0 |\u03be| \u2212 b0 (x) \u2264 W (x, \u03be) \u2264 a1 |\u03be| + b1 (x) for every (x, \u03be) \u2208 \u03a9\u00d7R\n\nW\nW\nW\n1\nHere aW\n0 > 0 and a1 > 0 are constants, while b0 and b1 are nonnegative functions in L (\u03a9).\nThe quasiconvexity assumption means that\nZ\nW (x, \u03be) \u2264\nW (x, \u03be + \u2207\u03c6(y)) dy\n\u03a9\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u03a9, \u03be \u2208 Rm\u00d7n , and \u03c6 \u2208 Cc\u221e (\u03a9; Rm ). The rank one convexity of \u03be 7\u2192 W (x, \u03be) on Rm\u00d7n\nand the growth assumption (2.6) imply (see, e.g., [6]) that there exist a positive constant aW\n2 >0\np\u2032\n\u2032\nand a nonnegative function bW\n\u2208\nL\n(\u03a9),\nwith\np\n:=\np/(p\n\u2212\n1),\nsuch\nthat\n2\nm\u00d7n\np\u22121\n|\u2202\u03be W (x, \u03be)| \u2264 aW\n+ bW\n,\n2 (x) for all (x, \u03be) \u2208 \u03a9\u00d7R\n2 |\u03be|\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03be W : \u03a9\u00d7Rm\u00d7n \u2192 Rm\u00d7n denotes the partial gradient of W with respect to \u03be.

Since we consider only conservative body and surface forces, it is convenient\nto describe them by means of their potentials, that will be denoted by F and G, respectively.\nLet q > 1 be fixed. The density of the applied body forces per unit volume in the reference\nconfiguration relative to the deformation u at time t \u2208 [0, T ] is then given by \u2202z F (t, x, u(x)).

The deformations on the boundary \u2202D \u03a9 are given by (the\ntraces of) functions \u03c8 \u2208 W 1,p (\u03a9; Rm ) \u2229 Lq (\u03a9; Rm ). Given a crack \u0393 \u2208 R(\u03a9B ) and a boundary\ndeformation \u03c8, the set of admissible deformations with finite energy relative to (\u03c8, \u0393) is defined\nby\ne \u0393, u = \u03c8 Hn\u22121 -a.e. on \u2202D \u03a9 \\ \u0393}.\nAD(\u03c8, \u0393) := {u \u2208 GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ) : S(u) \u2282\nNote that, if u \u2208 GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ), then W(\u2207u) < +\u221e and |F (t)(u)| < +\u221e for all t \u2208 [0, T ].\ne \u0393\u2282\ne \u03a9B , and \u2202S \u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9B = \u00d8, we have that G(t)(u) is well\nMoreover, since \u0393 \u2208 R(\u03a9B ), S(u) \u2282\ndefined and |G(t)(u)| < +\u221e for all t \u2208 [0, T ] (see [7, Section 3] for the details). Notice that there\nalways exists a deformation without crack which satisfies the boundary condition, namely the\nfunction \u03c8 itself. This means that, if some cracks appear, this is because they are energetically\nconvenient with respect to the elastic solution, and not because the presence of a crack is the only\nway to match the boundary condition.\nThe total energy. For every t \u2208 [0, T ] the total energy of the configuration (u, \u0393), with u \u2208\nAD(\u03c8, \u0393), is given by\n(2.10)\n\nE(t)(u, \u0393) := E el (t)(u) + E s (\u0393),\n\nwhere the surface energy E s is defined in (2.2), while the elastic energy E el (t) is given by\n(2.11)\n\nE el (t)(u) := W(\u2207u) \u2212 F (t)(u) \u2212 G(t)(u),\n\nwith W, F (t), and G(t) defined in (2.4), (2.8), and (2.9), respectively.\nThe time dependent boundary deformations.

The notion of quasistatic evolution of a cracked configuration is made\nprecise by the following definition.\nDefinition 2.1. A quasistatic evolution with boundary deformation t 7\u2192 \u03c8(t) is a function t 7\u2192\n(u(t), \u0393(t)) from [0, T ] to GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm )\u00d7R(\u03a9B ) with the following properties:\n(a) global stability: for all t \u2208 [0, T ] we have u(t) \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393(t)) and\ne \u0393, v \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393)};\nE(t)(u(t), \u0393(t)) = min{E(t)(v, \u0393) : \u0393 \u2208 R(\u03a9B ), \u0393(t) \u2282\n\n\f6\n\nG.

We are interested in quasistatic evolutions with a prescribed initial\ncondition (u0 , \u03930 ) with \u03930 \u2208 R(\u03a9B ) and u0 \u2208 AD(\u03c8(0), \u03930 ).

Let \u03930 \u2208 R(\u03a9B ) and u0 \u2208 AD(\u03c8(0), \u03930 ). Assume that (2.13) is satisfied.\nThen there exists a quasistatic evolution with boundary deformation \u03c8(t) such that (u(0), \u0393(0)) =\n(u0 , \u03930 ).\n3. Qualitative properties of the quasistatic crack growth\nIn this section we consider a quasistatic crack growth t 7\u2192 (u(t), \u0393(t)) with boundary deformation t 7\u2192 \u03c8(t) according to Definition 2.1. In the sequel we will derive some qualitative properties\nof the cracks \u0393(t) and of the deformations u(t).\n3.1. Left continuous envelope of the crack. For every t \u2208 ]0, T ] we define \u0393\u2212 (t) as the\nrectifiable set\n[\n\u0393\u2212 (t) :=\n\u0393(sk ),\nk\n\nwhere (sk ) is a sequence converging to t with sk < t for every k. We define \u0393\u2212 (0) := \u0393(0). Since\n\u0393(*) is increasing in time, it turns out that \u0393\u2212 (t) is independent of the choice of the sequence (sk ).\n\nProposition 3.1. For all t \u2208 [0, T ] we can find v(t) \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)) such that t 7\u2192 (v(t), \u0393\u2212 (t))\nis a quasistatic evolution with boundary deformation \u03c8(t).\nProof. If follows from the definition that \u0393\u2212 (t) is increasing with respect to t. Since t 7\u2192 \u0393(t) is\nincreasing, it turns out that \u0393\u2212 (t) = \u0393(t) for all t \u2208 [0, T ] except for a countable set C \u2282 ]0, T ].\nFor every t \u2208 [0, T ]\\C we set v(t) := u(t), while for t \u2208 C we take as v(t) any minimizer of\nmin{E el (t)(u) : u \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393\u2212 (t))}.\nLet us check that the three conditions for quasistatic evolutions hold for the function t 7\u2192\n(v(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)). Irreversibility has already been proved. As for global stability, let \u0393 be such that\ne \u0393, and let v \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393). We notice that \u0393(s) \u2282\ne \u0393 for every s < t, so that by the\n\u0393\u2212 (t) \u2282\nglobal stability of (u(s), \u0393(s)) we get\nE el (s)(u(s)) + E s (\u0393(s)) = E(s)(u(s), \u0393(s)) \u2264 E(s)(v \u2212 \u03c8(t) + \u03c8(s), \u0393).\n\nLet (sk ) with sk \u2192 t and sk < t for every k: up to a subsequence we have that u(sk ) \u21c0 \u0169 weakly\nin GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ) for some \u0169 \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)). By lower semicontinuity the previous inequality\ngives\nE el (t)(\u0169) + E s (\u0393\u2212 (t)) \u2264 E(t)(v, \u0393),\n\n\fA VARIATIONAL MODEL FOR QUASISTATIC CRACK GROWTH\n\n7\n\nso that by the minimality of v(t)\nE(t)(v(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)) = E el (t)(v(t)) + E s (\u0393\u2212 (t)) \u2264 E(t)(v, \u0393).\nLet us come to the energy balance. Since (v(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)) = (u(t), \u0393(t)) for all t up to a countable\nset, it is sufficient to prove that E(t)(v(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)) = E(t)(u(t), \u0393(t)) for all t \u2208 [0, T ]. By global\nminimality for every s < t we have\nE(s)(u(s), \u0393(s)) \u2264 E(s)(v(t) \u2212 \u03c8(t) + \u03c8(s), \u0393\u2212 (t))\nand so, since t 7\u2192 E(t)(u(t), \u0393(t)) is continuous by definition, we get for s \u2192 t\nE(t)(u(t), \u0393(t)) \u2264 E(t)(v(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)).\nThe opposite inequality comes from the global stability of (v(t), \u0393\u2212 (t)), so that the proposition is\nproved.\nWe can also consider the right continuous envelope of the crack. For every t \u2208 [0, T [ we define\n\u0393+ (t) as the rectifiable set\n\\\n\u0393+ (t) :=\n\u0393(sk ),\nk\n\nwhere (sk ) is a sequence converging to t with sk > t for every k. We define \u0393+ (T ) := \u0393(T ). Since\n\u0393(*) is increasing in time, it turns out that \u0393+ (t) is independent of the choice of the sequence (sk ).\nProposition 3.2. For all t \u2208 [0, T ] we can find v(t) \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393+ (t)) such that t 7\u2192 (v(t), \u0393+ (t))\nis a quasistatic evolution with boundary deformation \u03c8(t).\nProof. As in the proof of Proposition 3.1 we find that \u0393+ (t) = \u0393(t) for all t \u2208 [0, T ] except for a\ncountable set C \u2282 [0, T [, and for every t \u2208 C we take as v(t) any minimizer of\nmin{E el (t)(u) : u \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393+ (t))}.\nLet us check global stability and energy balance for the function t 7\u2192 (v(t), \u0393+ (t)). As for\ne \u0393, and let v \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393). For every s > t the global\nglobal stability, let \u0393 be such that \u0393+ (t) \u2282\nstability of (u(s), \u0393(s)) gives\nE(s)(u(s), \u0393(s)) \u2264 E(s)(v \u2212 \u03c8(t) + \u03c8(s), \u0393 \u222a \u0393(s)).\n\nLet (sk ) with sk \u2192 t and sk > t for every k: up to a subsequence we have that u(sk ) \u21c0 \u0169 weakly\nin GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ) for some \u0169 \u2208 AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393+ (t)). By lower semicontinuity the previous inequality\ngives\nE el (t)(\u0169) + E s (\u0393+ (t)) \u2264 E(t)(v, \u0393),\nso that by the minimality of v(t)\nE(t)(v(t), \u0393+ (t)) = E el (t)(v(t)) + E s (\u0393+ (t)) \u2264 E(t)(v, \u0393).\nLet us come to the energy balance. As in Proposition 3.1 it is sufficient to prove that E(t)(v(t), \u0393(t)) =\nE(t)(v(t), \u0393+ (t)) for all t \u2208 [0, T ]. The global stability of (v(t), \u0393+ (t)) gives, for every s > t,\nE(t)(v(t), \u0393+ (t)) \u2264 E(s)(u(s) \u2212 \u03c8(s) + \u03c8(t), \u0393(s)) \u2264 E(s)(u(s), \u0393(s)) + \u03c9(s),\nwhere \u03c9(s) \u2192 0 as s \u2192 t (see the estimates of [7, Section 5]). By the continuity of t 7\u2192\nE(t)(u(t), \u0393(t)) we obtain for s \u2192 t\nE(t)(v(t), \u0393+ (t)) \u2264 E(t)(u(t), \u0393(t)).\nThe opposite inequality comes from the global stability of (u(t), \u0393(t)), so that the proposition is\nproved.\n\n\f8\n\nG.

Let us\nRecall that \u0393\u0303(t) \u2282\nshow that the opposite inclusion holds. By (3.8), it is sufficient to prove that for all s \u2208 D\u2032 with\ne \u0393\u0303(t).

In the quasistatic evolution t 7\u2192 (u(t), \u0393(t)),\nthe deformation u(t) is, in general, not uniquely determined by \u0393(t). Indeed, if v(t) is another\nminimizer of E el (t) in AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393(t)), then the global stability condition still holds and the value\nof E(t) does not change. Therefore t 7\u2192 (v(t), \u0393(t)) is a quasistatic evolution provided (2.12) is\nsatisfied by v(t). The following result shows that we can select t 7\u2192 v(t) so that certain measurability properties hold. Similar results for a different evolution problem have been obtained\nindependently in [13].\nTheorem 3.5. We can choose t \u2192\n7\nv(t) in such a way that t 7\u2192 (v(t), \u0393(t)) is a quasistatic\nevolution with boundary condition t 7\u2192 \u03c8(t) and t 7\u2192 (\u2207v(t), v(t)) is measurable from [0, T ] to\nLp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n )\u00d7Lq (\u03a9; Rm ).\nProof.

Arguing as in [7, Section 7] we can prove that for every selection\nt 7\u2192 (\u2207\u1e7d(t), \u1e7d(t)) \u2208 A(t) the function t 7\u2192 (\u1e7d(t), \u0393\u0303(t)) is a quasistatic evolution. Since \u0393\u0303(t) = \u0393(t)\nfor t 6\u2208 C, the global stability condition gives E(\u1e7d(t), \u0393\u0303(t)) = E(u(t), \u0393(t)) for t 6\u2208 C, and the\ncontinuity condition in the energy balance ensures that E(\u1e7d(t), \u0393\u0303(t)) = E(u(t), \u0393(t)) for every\nt \u2208 [0, T ]. Therefore, if we define v(t) = \u1e7d(t) for t 6\u2208 C, and v(t) = u(t) for t \u2208 C, the function\nt 7\u2192 (v(t), \u0393(t)) is still a quasistatic evolution, and t 7\u2192 (\u2207v(t), v(t)) has the same measurability\nproperties as t 7\u2192 (\u2207\u1e7d(t), \u1e7d(t)).\nIn order to conclude the proof, it is enough to show that we can choose \u1e7d(t) so that t 7\u2192\n(\u2207\u1e7d(t), \u1e7d(t)) is measurable from [0, T ] to Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n )\u00d7Lq (\u03a9; Rm ).\nTo this aim, we notice that (\u2207v, v) \u2208 A(t) if and only if there exists a sequence kj \u2192 \u221e\nsuch that \u03b8kj (t) \u2192 \u03b8(t), \u2207ukj (t) \u21c0 \u2207v weakly in Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n ), and ukj (t) \u21c0 v weakly in\nLq (\u03a9; Rm ). Indeed the convergence in measure of ukj (t) required in (2.1) can be obtained from the\nGSBV compactness theorem (see [1, Theorem 4.36]), since Hn\u22121 (S(ukj (t)) is uniformly bounded.\n\n\fA VARIATIONAL MODEL FOR QUASISTATIC CRACK GROWTH\n\n11\n\nMoreover, in view of the coercivity estimates proved in [7], there exists a bounded closed convex\nset K \u2282 Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n )\u00d7Lq (\u03a9; Rm ) such that\n(\u2207uk (t), uk (t)) \u2208 K\nfor all t \u2208 [0, T ] and for all k. On K we consider the weak topology on Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n )\u00d7Lq (\u03a9; Rm ),\ns o that K is a compact metrizable space. In Lemma 3.6 below we will prove that\n(a) A(t) is closed in the weak topology for every t \u2208 [0, T ];\n(b) the set {t \u2208 [0, T ] : A(t)\u2229U 6= \u00d8} is measurable for every open set U in the weak topology\nof Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n )\u00d7Lq (\u03a9; Rm ).\nThen we can apply the Aumann-von Neumann selection theorem (see, e.g., [3, Theorem III.6])\nand we obtain that we can select (\u2207\u1e7d(t), \u1e7d(t)) \u2208 A(t) in such a way that t 7\u2192 (\u2207\u1e7d(t), \u1e7d(t))\nis measurable from [0, T ] to Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n )\u00d7Lq (\u03a9; Rm ) endowed with the weak topology. The\nmeasurability with respect to the strong topology follows from the Pettis theorem (see, e.g., [16,\nChapter V, Section 4]) .\nIn the rest of this subsection we prove the lemma concerning the measurability of the set valued\nmap t 7\u2192 A(t) used in the proof of Theorem 3.5. We settle the problem in the context of compact\nmetric spaces.\nConditions (a) and (b) in the proof of Theorem 3.5 follow from the next lemma, applied\nto X = K and fk (t) = (\u2207uk (t), uk (t)), with a metric d inducing on K the weak topology of\nLp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n )\u00d7Lq (\u03a9; Rm ).\nLemma 3.6. Let (X, d) be a compact metric space, let fk : [0, T ] \u2192 X be a sequence of measurable\nfunctions, and let \u03b8k and \u03b8 be measurable functions from [0, T ] to R.

Let us fix t \u2208 [0, T ] and let us prove that A(t) is closed in X. Let xj \u2208 A(t) with xj \u2192 x\nin X. Since xj \u2208 A(t), we can find kj \u2265 j such that\nd(xj , fkj (t)) \u2264\n\n1\nj\n\nand |\u03b8kj (t) \u2212 \u03b8(t)| \u2264 1j .\n\nClearly fkj (t) \u2192 x and \u03b8kj (t) \u2192 \u03b8(t), hence x \u2208 A(t) by the very definition of A(t).

For every j we define\nAj (t) := {x \u2208 X : there exists k \u2265 j such that d(fk (t), x) \u2264\nT\nand we observe that A(t) = j Aj (t).

To prove the opposite inequality, we may assume that the right-hand side of\n(3.13) is finite. For every j we fix yj \u2208 Aj (t) such that d(x, yj ) \u2264 d(x, Aj (t))+ 1j . As X is compact,\nthere exists a subsequence (yjm ) of (yj ) which converges to a point y.

The same property holds for the deformation and the deformation gradient, if some\nenergy terms are strictly convex.\nProposition 3.7. Let t \u2208 [0, T ] be such that \u0393(t) = \u0393\u2212 (t) and W, \u2212F (t), and \u2212G(t) are convex.\nThen\n(3.14)\n\n\u2032\n\nweakly in Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n ) as s \u2192 t\u2212 .\n\n\u2202W(\u2207u(s)) \u21c0 \u2202W(\u2207u(t))\n\nIf, in addition, W and \u2212F (t) are strictly convex, then\n(3.15)\n(3.16)\n\n\u2207u(s) \u2192 \u2207u(t)\nu(s) \u2192 u(t)\n\n(3.17)\n\nu(s) \u2192 u(t)\n\nstrongly in Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n ) as s \u2192 t\u2212 ,\nstrongly in Lq (\u03a9; Rm ) as s \u2192 t\u2212 ,\nstrongly in Lr (\u2202S \u03a9, Rm ) as s \u2192 t\u2212 .\n\nProof. Since \u0393(t) = \u0393\u2212 (t), using Proposition 3.3 it is easy to prove (see [7, Section 4.1]) that for\nevery sequence sj \u2192 t\u2212 there exists \u0393\u0303 such that\n\u03c3p\n\n\u0393(sk ) \u2192 \u0393\u0303\n\nand\n\n\u0393(t) = \u0393(0) \u222a \u0393\u0303.\n\nArguing as in [7, Sections 4 and 5] we deduce that there exist a subsequence, not relabelled, and\na minimizer \u0169 of E el (t) on AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393(t)) such that\n(3.18)\n\nu(sj ) \u21c0 \u0169 weakly in GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ),\n\n(3.19)\n\n\u2202W(\u2207u(sj )) \u21c0 \u2202W(\u2207\u0169) weakly in Lp (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7n ).\n\n\u2032\n\nSince u(t) is a minimizer of E el (t) on AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393(t)), by (3.19) the first part of the theorem is\nproved if we show that the triple\n(3.20)\n\n(\u2202W(\u2207\u0169), \u2212\u2202F (t)(\u0169), \u2212\u2202G(t)(\u0169))\n\nis the same for all minimizers.\nTo prove this property, we show that for every minimizer \u0169 of E el (t) on AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393(t)) the\ntriple (3.20) is a solution of a dual problem which, in our assumptions, admits a unique solution.\nLet us consider the linear space\n(3.21)\n\ne \u0393(t)},\nV(\u0393(t)) := {v \u2208 GSBVqp (\u03a9; Rm ) : S 0 (v) \u2282\n\nwhere S 0 (v) is defined as in (3.2) with \u03c8 = 0. Note that AD(\u03c8(t), \u0393(t)) = \u03c8(t) + V(\u0393(t)) =\n\u0169 + V(\u0393(t)).

To\nprove this fact we observe that the Euler's equation associated to the minimum problem satisfied\nby \u0169 yields\nh\u2202\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169), (\u2207v, v, v)i = 0 for all v \u2208 V(\u0393(t)).\nMoreover by duality we have that\n\u0001\n\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169) + \u03a8\u2217 \u2202\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169) = h\u2202\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169), (\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169)i,\n\nso that we conclude\n\nSince\n\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169) = \u2212h\u2202\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169), (\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169)i + \u03a8\u2217 \u2202\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169) .\n\u2202\u03a8(\u2207\u0169, \u0169, \u0169) = (\u2202W(\u2207\u0169), \u2212\u2202F (t)(\u0169), \u2212\u2202G(t)(\u0169)),\n\nthis proves our claim. By the assumption that W, \u2212F (t), and \u2212G(t) are convex and C 1 , we obtain\nthat\n\u03a8\u2217 (\u03c3) = W \u2217 (\u03c31 ) + (\u2212F (t))\u2217 (\u03c32 ) + (\u2212G(t))\u2217 (\u03c33 )\nis strictly convex, so that the problem in the right hand side of (3.26) admits a unique solution.\nThis proves that (3.20) is uniquely determined, concluding the proof of the first part of the\nproposition.\nLet us assume now the strict convexity of W and \u2212F (t). As a consequence E el (t) is strictly\nconvex, hence \u0169 = u(t). By (3.18) this proves (3.15)-(3.17) with the weak convergence.\nSince \u0393(t) = \u0393\u2212 (t), we have that E s (\u0393(s)) \u2192 E s (\u0393(t)) as s \u2192 t\u2212 . By continuity of the total\nenergy we have that\nlim\u2212 E el (s)(u(s)) = E el (t)(u(t)),\ns\u2192t\n\nUsing the lower semicontinuity of all terms in (2.11) we get\n(3.27)\n\nlim W(\u2207u(s)) = W(\u2207u(t)) and\n\ns\u2192t\u2212\n\nlim F (s)(u(s)) = F (t)(u(t)).\n\ns\u2192t\u2212\n\nThen the strong convergence in (3.15) and (3.16) can be derived from (3.27), using a general\nargument which allows to deduce strong convergence from weak convergence and convergence of\nstrictly convex energies (see [2]). The strong convergence in (3.17) follows from (3.27) in [7].\n\n\f14\n\nG. DAL MASO, A. GIACOMINI, AND M.
