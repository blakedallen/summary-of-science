INTRODUCTION\nWith the explosive growth of end user demand for\nhigher bandwidth, various types of passive optical networks\n(PONs) have been proposed. PON can be roughly divided\ninto two categories such as time-division-multiplexing\n(TDM) and ultra wide wavelength-division-multiplexing\n(UW-WDM) methods [1]. Compared with TDM-PONs,\nWDM-PON systems allocate a\nseparate wavelength to\neach subscriber, enabling the delivery of dedicated\nbandwidth per optical network unit (ONU). Moreover, this\nvirtual point-to-point connection enables a large guaranteed\nbandwidth, protocol transparency, high quality of service,\nexcellent security, bit-rate independence, and easy\nupgradeability. Especially, recent good progress on athermal\narrayed waveguide grating (AWG) and cost-effective\ncolorless ONUs [2] has empowered WDM-PON as an\noptimum solution for the access network. However, fiber link\nfailure from the optical line terminal (OLT) to the ONU leads\nto the enormous loss of data. Thus, fault monitoring and\nnetwork protection are crucial issues in network operators for\nManuscript received April 17, 2009\nManuscript revised , May 2009\n\nreliable network. To date [3], many methods have been\nproposed for network protection. In the ITU-T\nrecommendation on PONs (G.983.1) duplicated network\nresources such as fiber links or ONUs are required. The\nperiodic and cyclic properties of AWGs are used to\ninterconnect two adjacent ONUs by a piece of fiber. In the\nrecent years, arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) have\nappeared to be one of attractive candidates for high channel\ncount Mux/DeMux devices to process optical signals in a\nparallel manner. Its low chromatic dispersion [4], typically\n\u00b15 ps/nm - \u00b110 ps/nm, makes it possibly be used for 40\nGbit/s systems. However, it is well known that\nmanufacturing AWGs involves a series of complex\nproduction processes and requires bulky facilities [5]. Their\ncost remains a big issue. Further, the technical complexity\nleads to low yield and poor performance. The former, no\ndoubt, further increases the production cost while the latter\ndegrades the signal quality and system's performance [6],\nexhibiting high insertion loss, high channel crosstalk, low\nchannel uniformity, and high polarization dependent loss.\nMore vitally, AWGs require active temperature control in\norder to stabilize the thermal wavelength drift and\ntemperature-dependent loss variations [7]. Due to its\ncapability to increase the aggregate transmission capacity of\na single-strand optical fiber, the arrayed waveguide grating\n(AWG) multiplexer is considered a key component in the\nconstruction of a dense wavelength-division-multiplexing\nsystem [8]. However, an AWG made of silica is so sensitive\nto the ambient temperature that the output wavelength\nchanges by as much as 0.66 nm/oC [9]. In the present study, a\nhybrid material waveguide with lithium niobate (LiNbO3)\ncore material and PMMA cladding material is considered as\nthe most attractive a thermal structure because of its\nresistance to the thermo-optic sensitivity of the materials.\nFirst, the principle of the a thermal AWG with\nLiNbO3/PMMA hybrid materials is described, and the\nrelative formulas are derived for analyzing the temperature\ndependence of the AWG. Second, the theoretical analysis of\nthe data transmission bit rate of a thermal AWG in PONs\nbased on MTDM technique . Finally, a conclusion is reached\nbased on the analysis and general discussion.\n\n13\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, Vol. 1 No.1 May 2009\n\nII.

Simplified Passive Optical network architecture model.\n\nThe network architecture is shown in Fig. 1. It is based\non two cascaded Athermal arrayed waveguide gratings\n(AWGs). The first stage is an Nx1a thermal AWG located\nat the optical line terminal (OLT) or central office (CO).\nThe functionality of this a thermal AWG is to route optical\nsignals generated by the OLT laser diodes stack to each of\nthe network branches to which the OLT will serve [4]. The\nsecond stage is a 1\u00d7 M a thermal AWG located at the\nremote node. Its task is to demultiplex the M incoming\nwavelengths to each of the output ports, which connect to\noptical network channels and then to the number of\nsupported users. The entire network routing intelligence is\nlocated at the CO in order to provide easy upgradeability\nand easy integration with the backbone. The two cascade a\nthermal AWGs are connected to each other by the single\nmode optical fiber cables [5].\n\ngrating that takes advantage of the optical path difference in\nthe arrayed waveguide. Figure 2 shows a schematic view of\nAWG circuitry. As ambient temperature changes, the phase\nfront at each wavelength generated by the arrayed\nwaveguide will tilt due to the change in the refractive index\nof the optical waveguide and the linear expansion of the\nsilicon substrate, causing a shift of the focusing point on the\noutput waveguide within the slab waveguide [10].\n\nIII. Features Of A Thermal Arrayed\nWaveguide Grating Module\nArrayed waveguide grating (AWG) which handles the\nfunction of wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexer is\nextensively used in configuring optical communication\nnetworks that are becoming more diversified. Since the\ntransmission wavelength of an AWG is temperature\ndependent, it was a common practice to control its\ntemperature using heaters or Peltier elements. The AWG\nconsists of input waveguides, arrayed waveguide, slab\nwaveguide and output waveguides, constituting a diffraction\n\nFig. 2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe center wavelength at room temperature T0=27 C is\nselected to be \u03bb0= 1.550918 \u03bcm, which is one of the standard\nwavelengths\nrecommended\nby\nthe\nInternational\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) [16]. This AWG device is\nmade on the silicon substrate have a coefficient of thermal\nexpansion of \u03b1sub= 2.63x10-6/C [16]. Because the\nenvironmental temperature of an AWG is usually changed\nfrom 20 C t0 70 C. We discuss the central wavelength shift\n\u0394\u03bb in this range of temperature variation. The subsequent\nrelations between wavelength shift, and refractive-indices of\ncore, and cladding n1, n2 as well as the core width a are\ndiscussed as follows. Also, we discuss the maximum\ntransmission bit rate of AWG device model in the operating\nwavelength range from 1 \u03bcm to 1.64 \u03bcm as follows.\n1) Figure 4 has indicated the dependence of the thermooptic (TO) coefficient dn / dT on the temperature T.\n\nWe can find that dn / dT is not constant with the\nvariation of temperature which nonlinearly increases as\ntemperature increases. Therefore, this behavior of\ndn / dT will obviously affect the shifts of the central\nwavelength caused by the variation of temperature.\n2) As shown in Figs. (5-7) have demonstrated the\ndependence of the central wavelength shift \u0394\u03bb on the\nrefractive-indices of the core, and cladding n1, n2 as\nwell as the core width a for the designed a thermal\nhybrid material AWG, which are calculated from Eq.\n(12). We can find that there exists an optimal operation\ncondition of the AWG, which should guarantee the\ncentral wavelength shift \u0394\u03bb to be small enough in a\nsufficiently large range of the temperature variation. To\nbe precise, when we select n1= 2.33, n2=1.52, and a= 5\n\u03bcm, the central wavelength shift is within the range of\n0.012 ~ 0.015 nm as the temperature increases from 20\nC to 70 C. In this case we can presume that the a\nthermalization is realized in the designed AWG.\n\n3) Figure 8 has demonstrated the variation of the total\nchromatic dispersion Dt against the variation of optical\nsignal wavelength within the range from 1 \u03bcm to 1.64\n\u03bcm for different relative refractive-index difference \u0394n.\nWe can find that the smaller \u0394n, the smaller Dt within\nthe same variation of the optical signal wavelength.\n4) As shown in Fig. (9), the variation of the MTDM\ntransmission bit rate, against the variation of optical\nsignal wavelength within the range from 1 \u03bcm to 1.64\n\u03bcm for different relative refractive-index difference \u0394n.\nWe can find that the smaller \u0394n, the larger the bit rate\nwithin the same variation of the optical signal\nwavelength.\n5) Figures (10, 11) have indicated that as the number of\nlinks in the fiber cable core increse, MTDM bit rate\neither Per link or Per channel increases at the same\nrelative refractive index difference \u2206n. While the\nsmaller of \u2206n, the higher of bit rates either per link or\nper channel at the same number of links in the fiber\ncable core.\n6) Figures (12, 13) have indicated that as the number of\nlinks in the fiber cable core increse, MTDM bit rate\neither Per link or Per channel increases at the same\nambient temperature. While the smaller of T, the\nslightly higher of bit rates either per link or per channel\nat the same number of links in the fiber cable core.\n\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn a summary, we have presented a novel technique for\ntheoretical simulation and optimum design of the a thermal\nAWG with LiNbO3/PMMA hybrid materials. By selecting\nthe proper values of the refractive-indices of the materials\nand the core size of the waveguide, the a thermalization can\nbe realized. To be precise, the central wavelength shifts of\nthe designed a thermal hybrid material AWG only increases\nto 0.027 nm/C, while that of the conventional silica-based\nAWG increases to 0.66 nm/C [9], our designed a thermal\n\n20\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, Vol. 1 No.1 May 2009\nhybrid material AWG showed a good performance with \u0394\u03bb\n= ~ 0.027 nm/C over the temperature range of 20 C to 70 C.\nFinally, we can conclude that the smaller \u2206n, and the lower\nambient temperature T, The higher transmission bit rate of\nour a thermal hybrid material AWG model either per link or\nper channel which is appropriate for passive optical\nnetworks standards.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nOptical Fiber, Toward Gigabit Data Link,\" Applied\nOptics, vol. 35, no. 12, pp. 2048-2053, 1996.\n[13] C.
