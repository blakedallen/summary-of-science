The underlying growth mechanism\nis discussed.\n\nTo whom correspondence should be addressed: agupta@mint.ua.edu\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nIntroduction\nThere is considerable interest in the growth of high-quality, single crystal spinel ferrites\n\n(general formula AB2O4) films because to their numerous technological applications in areas\n1\n\nsuch as microwave integrated devices, magnetoelectric (ME) coupling heterostructures,\n\n2,3,4\n\nand\n\npotentially as an active barrier material in an emerging class of spintronic devices called spin\nfilters.\n\n5,6,7\n\nThis is in large part due to the unique property of a large class of spinel ferrites,\n\nincluding CoFe2O4 (CFO) and NiFe2O4 (NFO), of being magnetic insulators with a high\nmagnetic ordering temperature. The net magnetization in these materials is due to the existence\nof two magnetic sublattices, and they are thus strictly ferrimagnetic. Spinel oxides have a\ncomplex crystal structure with a large unit cell consisting of many interstitial sites. Moreover, the\ntransition metals can adopt various oxidation states. Thus, it is a challenging task to grow\nepitaxial spinel films (especially thick films) with low defect density and excellent magnetic\nproperties. Up to date, various thin film techniques, including pulsed laser deposition (PLD),\nsputtering, evaporation and chemical techniques have been used to grow epitaxial ferrite\nfilms.\n\n8,9,10,11,12\n\nBut the magnetic properties of epitaxially grown spinel ferrite films are\n\ngenerally far from ideal in comparison to those in the bulk, particularly for as-deposited films\nwithout post-anneal. The saturation magnetic moment (MS) of CFO films is generally between\n120-350 emu/cm3, well below the bulk value of 450 emu/cm3. Suzuki et al. reported a MS value\nof 400 emu/cm3 for CFO films grown on CoCr2O4-buffered MgAl2O4 substrates.\n\n13\n\nFor NFO\n\nfilms, Venzke et al. obtained a MS value of 190 emu/cm3, also quite a bit lower than the bulk\nvalue of 300 emu/cm3.\n\n14\n\nRecently, Luders et al. reported significantly enhanced MS of 1050\n\n2\n\n\femu/cm3 in ultrathin films of 3 nm in thickness, which they attributed to stabilization of the\n5\n\nnormal spinel near the interface.\n\nOne of the major obstacles in obtaining high-quality epitaxial ferrite films with bulk\nmagnetic properties is the lack of availability of isostructural substrates with good lattice match.\nSo far, ferrite films have primarily been grown on oxides substrates such as perovskite SrTiO3\n(STO),14 rock-salt MgO,\n\n15\n\nisostructural spinel MgAl2O4 (MAO),13 and various buffered\n\nsubstrates. None of these are ideal for the growth of ferrite films. MAO, with a lattice constant of\n8.08 \u00c5, has a large mismatch with NFO and CFO of over 3% (a = 8.34\u00c5 for NFO and 8.38\u00c5 for\nCFO). On the other hand, rock-salt MgO is better lattice matched with the ferrites, with a lattice\nparameter almost twice that of MgO (a = 4.212\u00c5). But spinel ferrite films grown on MgO are\nprone to anti-phase boundaries (APBs) from cation stacking defects originating from equivalent\nnucleation sites. Such films do not saturate even at magnetic fields as high as 5 Tesla and ultrathin films have been reported to be even superparamagnetic.\n\n16\n\nAn additional problem is the\n\ninter-diffusion associated with high growth temperature of ferrite films. Inter-diffusion is an\nespecially seriously issue for the growth of ferrite/ferroelectric heterostructures, since a number\nof ferroelectric materials of interest consist of volatile elements. Also, high temperature growth\non large mismatched substrates results in 3D island growth mode leading to a rough surface\nmorphology which is linked with misfit dislocation introduction.\n\n17\n\nIn order to circumvent these\n\nissues, a low temperature epitaxial growth method that results in films with excellent structural\nand magnetic properties is highly desirable.\nIt is well known that for high-misfit heteroepitaxial growth of semiconductor such as Ge\non Si, an effective approach to suppress island formation and achieve layer-by-layer growth is by\nreduction of the growth temperature.\n\n18\n\nThe degree to which one can control island formation by\n3\n\n\flow-temperature growth depends on the minimum temperature at which deposition leads to\nepitaxial growth. In the case of complex oxides including spinel ferrites, epitaxial growth is very\nsensitive to phase equilibrium and the oxidation kinetics, both of which are generally not favored\nat low temperatures. Nevertheless, Kiyomura et al.\n\n19\n\nhave reported growth of NiZn and MnZn-\n\nferrites films at relatively low temperature (200 oC). This is likely because Zn ions readily form\noxygen tetrahedrons at a lower temperature. Similarly, in the case of Fe3O4, simultaneous\nstabilization of Fe2+ and Fe3+ oxidation states requires that the films be grown under fairly\nreducing conditions (~10-6 Torr) and at low substrate temperatures (~350 oC). 20 For NFO and\nCFO, which are not easily oxidized, films are generally grown and/or ex-situ annealed at\nrelatively high temperatures (\u2265 600 \u00b0C).\nTo realize epitaxial growth of NFO and CFO films at lower temperatures, one needs to\nenhance the oxidation ability and also the kinetic energy of the ablated species. For conventional\nPLD in oxygen ambient, the background pressure used is generally in the range of several\nhundred mTorr. In this case, the mean free path of molecules is much shorter than the targetsubstrate distance and the kinetic energy of ablated species is dramatically reduced because of\ngas phase scattering and reaction.\n\n21\n\nThe oxidation capability at lower temperatures can be\n\nsignificantly enhanced by using ozone, thereby also enabling reduction of the background\npressure required for stoichiometric film growth. If the pressure can be reduced to a few mTorr\nwhile maintaining the oxygen activity, the mean free path of molecules will be comparable to the\ntarget-substrate distance and the high kinetic energy of the ablate species reaching the substrate\ncan be preserved to enable film growth at lower temperatures. In this study, we report a robust\nepitaxial growth mode for spinel ferrite films which can overcome the obstacles incurred in\nconventional film growth mode. Specifically, we demonstrate that epitaxial Ni/Co spinel ferrites\n\n4\n\n\ffilms, with large-scale atomically flat surface and enhanced magnetic moment, can to be grown\nat significantly lower temperatures than previously reported.\n\nII.\n\nExperimental\nWe prepared a series of NFO and CFO on (100)-oriented MAO substrates at various\n\ntemperatures (175, 250, 325, 400, 550, 690 oC), all under identical laser conditions of near 1.5\nJ/cm2 and high repetition rate of 10 Hz, and with background oxygen pressure of 10 mTorr\nmixed with 10-15% of ozone. The film growth was monitored in situ using reflection high\nenergy electron diffraction (RHEED). After growth, the samples were cooled down to room\ntemperature under an ozone/oxygen pressure of 100 mTorr. Prior to deposition, the substrates\nwere annealed between 1300-1400 oC in air for 6 hrs to obtain an atomically-flat step and terrace\nprofile. NFO films were also grown at temperatures as low as 100 oC but they showed poor\nmagnetic properties, although the surface morphology and RHEED pattern were similar to\nhigher temperature grown films. Films grown at room temperature were amorphous. For\ncomparison purpose, some films were also deposited on (100)-oriented STO and MgO substrates\nat 250 oC.\nA standard \u03b8-2\u03b8 x-ray diffraction setup (Phillips X' pert Pro) was used to determine the\nphase and epitaxy of the films. XRD measurements were performed using a CuK\u03b1 source\noperating at 45kV and 40 mA. Films surface morphology was characterized using atomic force\nmicroscopy (Veeco NanoScope) scanned in the tapping mode. The growth rate was calibrated\nusing X-ray reflectivity, and film thicknesses were measured by Dektak surface profilometer and\nAFM. Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was used to determine the film cation\n\n5\n\n\fstoichiometry. Magnetic properties of the NFO and CFO films were measured using a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer.\nIII.\n\nResults and Discussion\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements reveal that all films grown at and below\n\n550 oC on MAO substrate are atomically flat with clear steps, virtually identical to the substrate even for films thicker than 200 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) for NFO films. Typical step\nheights are nearly 4 \u00c5 (half unit-cell) or 8 \u00c5 (one unit-cell), as shown in Fig. 1(d). On increasing\nthe temperature to 690 oC, quasi-3D growth is observed for the NFO film as shown in Fig. 1(c),\nbut the step pattern of the substrate can still be faintly distinguished. A 1\u00d71 \u03bcm2 image of the\nfilm is provided in the inset to Fig. 1(c) exhibiting islands of less than 3 nm in height (Fig. 1(e).\nAlmost identical surface morphology has also been observed as a function of growth temperature\nfor CFO films (not shown). The AFM measurements are consistent with the RHEED patterns\nrecorded after films growth, as shown in the upper-left insets of Figures 1(a) and 1(c). All the\nfilms (except the film grown at 690 oC) show very clear streaky RHEED patterns, indicating\ntwo-dimensional (2D) type epitaxial growth. No RHEED oscillations are observed, but the\nRHEED pattern and streak intensities remain essentially unchanged throughout the growth\nprocess, similar to that observed for step flow growth mode. Moreover, we have determined that\nthe surface morphology, as determined using AFM, remains essentially the same for films with\ndifferent thicknesses. Films grown at 690 oC exhibit a spotty RHEED pattern, indicating island\ngrowth (3D). We have also grown NFO and CFO films on STO and MgO substrates at 250 oC,\nall of which show atomically flat surfaces, essentially identical to the substrate morphology as\nshown in Fig. 2, suggesting that the growth mechanism is independent of the substrate. We have\nused Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) to determine the film stoichiometry. For all\n6\n\n\fthe NFO and CFO films, the Fe to Ni/Co ratio is found to be close to the expected value of 2.0\nbased on the target composition.\nWe have carried out detailed texture and epitaxy analysis of our films, including\nsymmetric 2\u03b8-\u03b8 scans, rocking curves, phi scans and reciprocal space maps. Large-angle 2\u03b8-\u03b8\nscans show only diffraction peaks corresponding to NFO or CFO film and the MAO substrate.\nNo evidence of any secondary phases is found. In Fig. 3(a) and (b) we plot \u03b8 - 2\u03b8 spectra near the\n(400) reflection of the MAO substrate of NFO and CFO films, respectively, grown at different\ntemperatures. All the films exhibit clear x-ray diffraction peaks corresponding to the (400) film\nreflections, with the peak position gradually shifting to higher angles with increasing substrate\ntemperature, indicating a decrease in the out-of-plane lattice parameter (az). This can either be\ndue to increasing strain relaxation or reduced oxygen deficiency with increasing growth\ntemperatures. Either way, since all films are nominally of the same thickness (within 5% of each\nother), this effect is completely temperature driven.\nIn Fig. 3(c) we plot the growth temperature dependence of the calculated az values. As is\nclear from the plots, NFO and CFO films behave quite differently. For NFO films, az decreases\nalmost monotonically from 175 oC to 690 oC but still above the bulk value (8.340\u00c5, blue line)\neven at the highest growth temperature (az = 8.361\u00c5 at 690 oC). For CFO films, az increases\nmuch more rapidly for films grown below 325 oC. At higher temperatures, the lattice constant\nappears to saturate to a value of nearly 8.405 \u00c5, somewhat above the bulk value of 8.390 \u00c5 for\nCFO (red line).\nEpitaxial analysis has been further carried out by performing phi-scans around the (311)\nreflection of the film and substrate. In Fig. 3(d) we show the phi-scans for the NFO films (CFO\nfilms show qualitatively similar behavior). Four sharp peaks, 90 degrees apart, confirm cubic\n\n7\n\n\fsymmetry of the films down to the lowest temperature (175 oC). Higher temperature improves\nboth the FWHM and peak intensities of the phi scans, consistent with the texture analysis from\nrocking curves measurements as shown in Fig. 4. We observe more than a factor of five\nimprovement in full-width at half-maxima (FWHM) and intensity for NFO films grown at 550\noC (FWHM ~ 0.3o) and 690 oC (FWHM ~ 0.2o) as compared to the low temperature films\n(FWHM ~ 1.0o). For the CFO films, the improvement in texture is more gradual as compared to\nNFO.\nOverall, x-ray measurements reveal varying degree of epitaxy for all films, with\nincreasing temperature improving both the film texture and epitaxy. This conclusion, even\nthough understandable is still surprising for the following reason: One straight-forward\nconsequence of low temperature growth is the lack of surface diffusion for the incident species,\nand at a low enough temperature this is expected to prevent single phase formation and,\ntherefore, crystalline growth. This clearly is not the case for our films. Since we do not find any\nevidence of temperature-related phase instability, we conclude that the temperature requirement\nfor the NFO and CFO phase formation is lower than 175 oC, particularly in the phase space of\nour deposition conditions. Once phase formation is guaranteed, epitaxy and texture improves\nsteadily with temperature, as expected. Also, the epitaxy and texture improvement can be\nroughly correlated with smoothening of the step-terrace features of the AFM images at higher\ntemperatures. We next present our magnetic analysis.\nIn Fig. 5(a) we plot magnetization loops measured at 5K for NFO (blue) and CFO (red)\nfilms grown at 325 oC. Films grown at other temperatures exhibit a similar loop shape and\ncoercivity, differing only in the saturation magnetization. The magnetization saturates fairly well\nat around 3 Tesla, suggestive of a low density of anti-phase boundaries (APBs), consistent with\n\n8\n\n\fthe report of Rigato et al.\n\n22\n\nThe coercive fields are about 0.3 T and 1.1 T for NFO and CFO\n\nfilms, respectively. These values are higher than the literature reports, but it is well known that\ncoercivity depends on extrinsic factors such as growth conditions, post-deposition annealing, etc.\nFig. 5(b) shows the growth temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization (MS) values\nof NFO and CFO films. For both films, a similar qualitative trend is observed. The MS values are\nclose to the bulk values of 300 emu/cc and 450 emu/cc for NFO and CFO, respectively, for the\nfilms grown at higher temperatures (550 oC and 690 oC). Among the films grown at lower\ntemperatures, we observe an enhanced magnetization for films grown at 400 oC and 325 oC,\nwhile the values are somewhat below that for the bulk for films deposited at or lower than 250\noC. The increase in the saturation magnetization value of CFO films grown at intermediate\ntemperatures is especially striking, over 500 emu/cm3 - about 15-20% higher than the bulk value.\nAs mentioned earlier, such anomalous values have previously been reported in ultra-thin NFO\nfilms.5 In our films, the high magnetization values are also likely due to temperature-induced\ncation-disorder. It is encouraging that even for films grown at 175 oC the MS values are still\nclose to the bulk values implying even these films are not far from the expected inverse-spinel\nconfiguration. The NFO and CFO films grown on STO substrates show reduced saturation\nmagnetization of nearly 200 emu/cc for NFO, and less than 300 emu/cc for CFO. This is\nconsistent with earlier literature reports.14\nHere we discuss the possible growth mechanism. As illustrated in Fig. 6(a), the (100)\nspinel surface has a relatively open structure with both the octahedral and tetrahedral surface\nsites not being blocked during the growth process. The tetrahedral sites form a ( 2 /2)as\u00d7( 2\n/2)as-45o (as = lattice constant) unit cell at the surface (marked as black square in Fig. 6(a)) and\nthe octahedral sites (marked as red rectangle) forms a ( 2 /2)as\u00d7( 2 /4)as-45o unit cell. For the\n9\n\n\finverse spinel ferrites NFO and CFO, the Fe ions will occupy both the octahedral and tetrahedral\nsites, while Ni/Co ions will occupy only the octahedral sites. The relatively low ozone/oxygen\npressure used during growth ensures that the incident species have sufficient kinetic energy\nrequired for such an activity. Furthermore, ozone helps in enhancing the oxidation kinetics at low\ntemperatures. We speculate that the ablated cation species that reach the substrate surface locally\ncrystallize at the nearest available site without requiring long-range surface diffusion. This, we\nbelieve, is unique to spinels and maybe related to the fact that many equivalent configurations\nare possible that maintain the spinel crystallographic symmetry. We term this growth as \"vertical\nstep-flow mode\" since it is reminiscent of the \"lateral\" step-flow growth where the adatoms\nnucleate at the step terrace and propagate to the step edge (see Fig. 6 (b)). This helps explain why\nthe streaky RHEED pattern remains essentially unchanged during growth and atomically flat\nsurfaces are preserved even for thick films.\nIV.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a novel growth mode, which we term \"vertical step-\n\nflow\", for spinel ferrite films that results in high quality films with large-scale atomically flat\nsurface and enhanced magnetic moment. The growth mode is independent of the nature of\nsubstrates (MAO, STO, MgO) and film thicknesses, and results in epitaxy at significantly lower\ntemperatures than previously reported. While the underlying mechanism is not completely\nunderstood, we speculate that our study will inspire further investigation for this novel growth\nprocess and promote device applications of spinel films.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by ONR (Grant No. N00014-09-0119).
