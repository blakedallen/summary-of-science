Introduction\nThe focus of this paper is to prove new results about transversality and related geometric\nproperties of a holomorphic (or formal) mapping that sends one generic submanifold of CN\ninto another. Our main result is a sufficient condition for such a mapping to be transversal\nto the target manifold. We also give applications and refinements of this result such as\ne.g. a criterion for a finite mapping to be a local (formal) biholomorphism.\nIn order to state our results more precisely, we need to introduce some notation. Recall\nthat a real smooth submanifold M of codimension d through p0 in CN is called generic\n(at p0 ) if there is a smooth function \u03c1 : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 Rd such that M is locally given near\np0 by \u03c1 = 0 and\n\u2202\u03c11 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u2202\u03c1d 6= 0\nat p0 . A generic submanifold M is a CR manifold with the CR structure defined by the\nCR bundle T 0,1 M := CT M \u2229 T 0,1 CN and its complex conjugate T 1,0 M := T 0,1 M. Here,\nCT M denotes the complexified tangent space of M and T 0,1 CN denotes the bundle of\nf \u2282 CN be a generic submanifold and p\u03030 \u2208 M\nf. A germ of a\n(0, 1) vectors on CN .

Recall that if f : (R , p0 ) \u2192 (R , p\u03030 ) is a\nf \u2282 Rl is a smooth manifold through p\u03030 , then f is called\ngerm of a smooth map, and if M\nf at p0 if\ntransversal to M\n(1.2)\n\nf + df (Tp0 Rk ) = Tp\u03030 Rl\nTp\u03030 M\n\nf at p0 , then\n(see e.g. [GG86]).

However, the notions of transversality and CR\nf is generic at p0 (see Section 5).\ntransversality coincide if H \u22121 (M)\nOne of the main results in this paper, Theorem 3.1, is a sufficient condition for a holomorphic mapping H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) to be CR transversal to a generic submanifold\nf \u2282 CN through p\u03030 . Our condition is also necessary in some cases (see e.g. Theorem\nM\n1.3). A special case of Theorem 3.1 is the following. Recall that a generic submanifold\nM is said to be of finite type at p0 (in the sense of Kohn, and Bloom\u2013Graham) if the\n(complex) Lie algebra gM generated by all smooth (1, 0) and (0, 1) vector fields tangent\nto M satisfies gM (p0 ) = CTp0 M.\nf \u2282 CN be a smooth generic submanifold of finite type at p\u03030 and\nTheorem 1.1. Let M\nN\nN\nH : (C , p0 ) \u2192 (C , p\u03030 ) a finite holomorphic mapping. If there exists a smooth generic\nf with H(M) \u2282 M\nf, then H\nsubmanifold M \u2282 CN through p0 of the same dimension as M\nf at p0 .\nis CR transversal to M\nWe would like to point out that since H is assumed to be a finite mapping, the condition\nf is of finite type at p\u03030 could be replaced by the condition that M is of finite type\nthat M\nf are assumed to be hypersurfaces,\nat p0 (see Proposition 2.3). In the case where M and M\nTheorem 1.1 follows from results by Baouendi and the second author (see [BR90]). The\ncase of generic submanifolds of higher codimension had remained an open problem since\nthe publication of [BR90].\nTheorems 1.1 and 3.1 can be viewed as formal Hopf Lemma type results. For smooth\nmappings between hypersurfaces where the target has some convexity properties, results\nof this type have been known for some time; see Fornaess [Forn76], [Forn78] for the case of\npseudoconvex hypersurfaces and [BR93] for a more general convexity condition. See also\n[BHR95] by Baouendi, X. Huang, and the second author, and [HP96] by Huang and Y.\nPan for other types of Hopf lemmas for smooth mappings between hypersurfaces. Other\nresults along these lines in the higher codimensional case can be found in e.g. the papers\n[CR94], [CR98] by Chirka and Rea.\nThe other results in this paper are refinements and applications of Theorem 3.1. It is\neasy to find examples (see Section 6) of finite holomorphic mappings satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 (and, hence, CR transversal) that are not biholomorphic. In our\n\n\fTRANSVERSALITY OF CR MAPPINGS\n\n3\n\nnext result, we give a sufficient condition on the source manifold M that guarantees that\nany finite holomorphic mappings sending M into a generic submanifold is biholomorphic.\nRecall that M is said to be finitely nondegenerate at p0 if\n\u001b\n\u001a \u0012 j\u0013\n\u2202\u03c1\nn\n\u03b1\n(p0 ) : j = 1, . . . , d, \u03b1 \u2208 N+ = CN ,\n(1.3)\nspanC L\n\u2202Z\nwhere spanC denotes the vector space spanned over C and L\u03b1 := L\u03b11 1 . . . L\u03b1nn . Here,\nL1 , . . . , Ln is a basis for the smooth (0, 1) (or CR) vector fields tangent to M near p0 , and\n\u03c1 = (\u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1d )t is a defining function for M near p0 . The following is a consequence of\nour Theorem 6.5.\nTheorem 1.2. Let M \u2282 CN be a smooth generic submanifold of finite type and finitely\nf \u2282 CN is a smooth generic submanifold of the same dimennondegenerate at p0 \u2208 M. If M\nf,\nsion and H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 CN is a germ of a finite holomorphic mapping with H(M) \u2282 M\nthen H is a local biholomorphism at p0 .\nAn early result of this type is contained in a paper by Pinchuk [P77] in which he proves\nthat nonconstant CR mappings between strictly pseudoconvex hypersurfaces are local\ndiffeomorphisms. For self maps of hypersurfaces, see also Bedford and Bell [BB82] as well\nas [BR93].\nFor essentially finite generic manifolds of finite type, the converse of Theorem 1.1 is\nalso true. (See Section 6.) More precisely, we have the following result.\nTheorem 1.3. Let M \u2282 CN be a smooth generic submanifold of finite type and essentially\nf \u2282 CN is a smooth generic submanifold of the same dimension,\nfinite at p0 . Suppose M\nf Then the\nand H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 CN a germ of a holomorphic mapping with H(M) \u2282 M.\nfollowing are equivalent.\nf at p0 ;\n(i) H is CR transversal to M\n(ii) H is a finite mapping.\n\nThe implication (ii) =\u21d2 (i) in Theorem 1.3 follows immediately from Theorem 1.1,\nwhile (i) =\u21d2 (ii) is a special case of Theorem 6.1. (In fact, the implication (i) =\u21d2 (ii)\nholds without the assumption that M is of finite type at 0 and (ii) =\u21d2 (i) holds without\nthe assumption that M is essentially finite at 0. See Section 7 and Theorem 1.1.)\nIn order to formulate another corollary of Theorem 3.1, we restrict to the case of realanalytic manifolds. We recall that the Segre variety at p, \u03a3p , of a real-analytic generic\nsubmanifold M of CN (given near a point p0 \u2208 M by \u03c1 = 0) is the complex manifold\n(near p0 ) defined by the equation\n(1.4)\n\n\u03c1(Z, p\u0304) = 0,\n\nwhere, by a slight abuse of notation, \u03c1(Z, \u03b6) denotes also the complexification of \u03c1. Observe that, as is well known, if H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) is a holomorphic mapping sending\n\n\f4\n\nP. EBENFELT AND L. P.

We write h for the induced holomorphic mapping (\u03a3p0 , p0 ) \u2192 (\u03a3\u0303p\u03030 , p\u03030 ). We have the\nfollowing.\nf \u2282 CN be real-analytic generic submanifolds of the same diTheorem 1.4. Let M, M\nf of finite type at p\u03030 .

If h is finite, then H is\nf and finite at p0 . Furthermore, the multiplicity of H equals that of\nCR transversal to M\nh.\n\nf are hypersurfaces follow from\nBoth Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 in the case where M and M\nresults in [BR90], but the methods of proof given in the latter work do not generalize to\nthe case of higher codimensional manifolds.\nWe should point out that the conclusions of Theorems 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 still hold if\nthe finite holomorphic mapping H is replaced by a finite CR mapping f . Recall that a\nsmooth mapping f : (M, p0 ) \u2192 CN is called CR if the tangent mapping df sends the CR\nbundle T 0,1 M into T 0,1 CN . (In particular, the restriction to M of a holomorphic mapping\nH : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 CN is CR.) A CR mapping f is called finite if the associated formal power\nf \u2282 CN is another generic submanifold\nseries mapping is finite (see Sections 2 and 6). If M\nf, then f is said to be CR transversal to M\nf at p0 if\nand f (M) \u2282 M\n\n(1.5)\n\n0,1 f\nf\nf\nTf1,0\n(p0 ) M + Tf (p0 ) M + df (CTp0 M) = CTf (p0 ) M.\n\nOne can check (see Section 5) that if f = H|M , for some holomorphic mapping H, and\nf then f is CR transversal to M\nf at p0 if and only if H satisfies (1.1).\nf (M) \u2282 M,\nOne of the most important tools used in this paper (and a crucial new ingredient\nfor the proof of Theorem 1.1 beyond the hypersurface case) is that of the iterated Segre\nmappings as developed by the authors, jointly with M. S. Baouendi, in the papers [BER96],\n[BER99b], and [BER03] (see also the book [BER99a]). These have also played a significant\nrole in recent work on other aspects of mappings between generic submanifolds, especially\nthose of codimension greater than one. We mention here work of Zaitsev [Z97], [Z99], S.-Y.\nKim and Zaitsev [KZ01], and Mir [Mi00], [Mi02a], [Mi02b]. See also [BER98], [BER00],\n[BMR02], [MMZ03].\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we give some preliminary definitions\nand results about formal manifolds and mappings, finite type, and the iterated Segre\nmappings. One of our main results, Theorem 3.1, is then stated and proved in Section\n3. We also give a slightly stronger version of this theorem in the case of hypersurfaces in\nSection 4. In the next section, equivalent notions of transversality are discussed.

Suppose that \u03c1 = (\u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1d ) \u2208 C[[Z, \u03b6]]d, where Z = (Z1 , . . . , ZN )\nand \u03b6 = (\u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6N ), satisfies the reality condition \u03c1(Z, \u03b6) = \u03c1\u0304(\u03b6, Z), where \u03c1\u0304 is the formal\nseries obtained from \u03c1 by replacing each coefficient in the series by its complex conjugate.\nIf, in addition, the series \u03c1 satisfies the condition \u03c1(0) = 0, and\n\u2202(Z,\u03b6) \u03c11 (0) \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u2202(Z,\u03b6) \u03c1d (0) 6= 0,\nthen we say that \u03c1 defines a formal real submanifold M of CN through 0 of codimension\nd (and dimension 2N \u2212 d). If the defining series satisfies the stronger condition\n\u2202Z \u03c11 (0) \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u2202Z \u03c1d (0) 6= 0,\nwe shall say that M is generic, and refer to n := N \u2212 d as the CR dimension of M. If\nM is a formal real submanifold of codimension d = 1, then it is necessarily generic; we\nshall refer to such an M as a formal real hypersurface. These definitions are motivated\nby the fact that if in addition the components of \u03c1 are convergent power series, then\nthe equations \u03c1(Z, Z\u0304) = 0 define a generic real-analytic submanifold M of CN through\n0. Also, if M is a smooth generic submanifold in CN through 0, then the Taylor series\nat 0 of a smooth defining function \u03c1(Z, Z\u0304) of M near 0, with Z\u0304 formally replaced by \u03b6,\ndefines a formal generic submanifold through 0 (which by a slight abuse of notation will\nstill be denoted by M). These observations will be used to deduce the results given in\nthe introduction from the corresponding results for formal real submanifolds.\nLet H : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) be a formal holomorphic (or simply formal) mapping, i.e.\nH \u2208 C[[Z1 , . . . , ZN ]]N and each component of H(Z) = (H1 (Z), . . . , HN (Z)) has no conf are formal real submanifolds of CN defined by formal series\nstant term.

Then, there is a unique formal mapping H such that the Taylor series of\nf (x) at 0 equals H(Z(x)) as a power series in x (see e.g. [BER99a], Proposition 1.7.14).\n\n\f6\n\nP. EBENFELT AND L. P.

Its codimension is then called the essential type of\nM at 0 and is denoted Ess 0 (M).\nIf H : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) is a formal finite mapping, then we define the multiplicity of\nH by\n(6.2)\n\nmult (H) := dimC C[[Z]]/I(H(Z)).\n\nFor a holomorphic mapping H, mult (H) is the number of distinct preimages of a generic\npoint.\nBefore we state our main result, we introduce another, weaker, transversality notion\nf be a formal generic submanifold of codimension d through\nfor a formal mapping. Let M\nf at 0. If H : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) is a\n0 in CN , and let (z\u0303, w\u0303) be normal coordinates for M\nformal mapping, with H = (F, G) in the normal coordinates (z\u0303, w\u0303), then we shall say that\nf at 0 if the ideal I(G(Z)) generated by G1 (Z), . . . , Gd (Z)\nH is transversally regular to M\nhas dimension n = N \u2212 d, i.e. if the Krull dimension of the ring C[[Z]]/I(G(Z)) is N \u2212\nd. An equivalent way of expressing this is that the ideal I(\u03c1\u0303(H(Z), 0)) generated by\n\u03c1\u03031 (H(Z), 0), . . . , \u03c1\u0303d (H(Z), 0) has dimension N \u2212 d; here, \u03c1\u0303 = (\u03c1\u03031 , . . . , \u03c1\u0303d ) is any defining\nf, and Z is any local coordinate in CN near 0. Another equivalent condition\nfunction for M\nis that {G1 (Z), . . . , Gd (Z)} is a regular sequence in C[[Z]]/I(H(Z)).\nf at 0, then it is also transversally\nWe should point out that if H is CR transversal to M\nf\nf at 0 is\nregular to M at 0. For a convergent mapping H, being transversally regular to M\nalso equivalent to the dimension of the germ at 0 of the variety {G1 (Z) = . . . = Gd (Z) =\nf is\n0} (or equivalently the variety {\u03c1\u03031 (H(Z), 0) = . . . = \u03c1\u0303d (H(Z), 0) = 0}) being n. If M\nf at 0 if and only\na formal hypersurface (i.e. d = 1), then H is transversally regular to M\nif G 6\u2261 0. The main theorem of this section is the following.\n\nf be formal generic submanifolds of the same CR dimension\nTheorem 6.1. Let M, M\nN\nthrough 0 \u2208 C , and H : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) a formal holomorphic mapping sending M\nf. Assume that M is essentially finite and M\nf is of finite type at 0. If H is\ninto M\nf\nf\ntransversally regular to M at 0, then H is a finite mapping that is CR transversal to M\n\n\fTRANSVERSALITY OF CR MAPPINGS\n\n23\n\nf is essentially finite at 0 with\nat 0. Furthermore, M\n\n(6.3)\n\nf).\nEss 0 (M) = mult (H)Ess 0 (M\n\nf if and only if H is a formal biholomorphism.\nIn particular, Ess 0 (M) = Ess 0 M\n\nFor the proof of Theorem 6.1, we need some preliminary results. We begin by taking\nf, and letting H be a formal\nnormal coordinates Z = (z, w) for M and Z\u0303 = (z\u0303, w\u0303) for M\nf. If H is Segre finite, then we denote by mH the integer\nmapping sending M into M\n(6.4)\n\nmH := dimC C[[z]]/I(F (z, 0)).\n\nIt should be noted that the definition of mH is independent of the choices of normal\nf. Observe that if M and M\nf are real-analytic and H is a\ncoordinates for M and M\nf are given by \u03a30 = {(z, 0)},\nholomorphic mapping, then the Segre varieties \u03a30 , \u03a3\u03030 of M, M\n\u03a3\u03030 = {(z\u0303, 0)}, respectively, and the induced mapping of Segre varieties h : (\u03a30 , 0) \u2192\n(\u03a3\u03030 , 0) is given by h(z) = F (z, 0). Hence, H is Segre finite if and only if h is a finite\nmapping.\nThe following useful observation is standard.\nf be formal generic submanifolds of the same CR dimension through\nLemma 6.2. Let M, M\nf.\n0 \u2208 CN , and H : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) a formal holomorphic mapping sending M into M\nThe following hold.\n\n(i) If H is finite, then H is Segre finite, mH \u2264 mult (H), and H is transversally regular\nf at 0.\nto M\n(ii) If H is Segre finite, then H is not totally degenerate.\nf at 0, then H is finite and mH =\n(iii) If H is Segre finite and CR transversal to M\nmult (H).\nProof. We first prove (i). Since, as is well known, G(z, w) = a(z, w)w for some d \u00d7 d\nmatrix valued formal power series a(z, w), we have I(G(z, w)) \u2282 I(w). It follows that\nI(F (z, w), G(z, w)) \u2282 I(F (z, 0), w). From this, the fact that H is Segre finite and mH \u2264\nmult (H) immediately follows. Since I(F (z, w), G(z, w)) being of finite codimension is\nequivalent to having dimension 0, it follows, in particular, that {G1 (Z), . . . , Gd (Z)} is a\nregular sequence, i.e. H is transversally regular.\nThe statement (ii) is an immediate consequence of the fact that a finite map h satisfies\nJac (h) 6\u2261 0; see e.g. [BER99a], Theorem 5.1.37.\nFor (iii), we observe that the CR transversality of H implies that the ideal I(G(z, w))\nequals I(w). Hence, I(F (z, w), G(z, w)) = I(F (z, 0), w), from which (iii) easily follows.\n\u0003\nf when\nWe shall also need the following result relating the essential types of M and M\nf\nthere is a formal holomorphic map H from M to M .

In both cases, we have the identity\nf\n(6.5)\nEss p (M) = mH Ess p (M),\nwhere mH is defined by (6.4).\n\nf\nProof. As before, we take normal coordinates Z = (z, w) and Z\u0303 = (z\u0303, w\u0303) for M and M\nrespectively. Since G(z, 0) \u2261 0 and det (\u2202G/\u2202w)(0) 6= 0, we have\n(6.6)\n\nG(z, w) = a(z, w)w,\n\ne z\u0303(0) = 0, we\nwhere the d \u00d7 d matrix a(z, w) satifies det a(0) 6= 0. Moreover, since \u2202 Q/\u2202\nalso have\ne (z, w), \u03c7\u0303, 0) = Q(F\ne (z, 0), \u03c7\u0303, 0) + b(z, \u03c7\u0303, w)w,\n(6.7)\nQ(F\n\nwhere the d \u00d7 d matrix b(z, \u03c7\u0303, w) satisfies b(0) = 0. Substituting (6.6) and (6.7) with\nw = Q(z, \u03c7, 0) and \u03c7\u0303 = F\u0304 (\u03c7, 0) in the identity (2.3) above, we obtain\n(6.8) a(z, Q(z, \u03c7, 0))Q(z, \u03c7, 0) =\ne (z, 0), F\u0304 (\u03c7, 0), 0) + b(z, F\u0304 (\u03c7, 0), Q(z, \u03c7, 0))Q(z, \u03c7, 0),\nQ(F\nwhich can be written as\n(6.9)\n\ne (z, 0), F\u0304 (\u03c7, 0), 0) = c(z, \u03c7)Q(z, \u03c7, 0)\nQ(F\n\nwhere c(z, \u03c7) is a d \u00d7 d matrix with det c(0) 6= 0. Now, the conclusions of Proposition 6.3\nfollow from (6.9) by the algebraic arguments in Section 4 of [BR88]. We refer the reader\nto that paper for the details.\n\u0003\nThe final result we need for the proof of Theorem 6.1 is the following, which can be\nviewed as a generalization of a result in [BR90] to higher codimensional manifolds.\nf be formal generic submanifolds of the same dimension through\nTheorem 6.4. Let M, M\nf.\n0 \u2208 CN , and H : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) a formal holomorphic mapping sending M into M\nIf M is essentially finite at 0 and H is transversally regular, then H is Segre finite.\nProof. Assume that H is not Segre finite, i.e. that the ideal I(F (z, 0)), or equivalently\nI(F\u0304 (\u03c7, 0)), does not have finite codimension. We will show that H is not transversally\nregular. The ideal I(F\u0304 (\u03c7, 0)) does not have finite codimension in C[[\u03c7]] if and only if\nthere is a (not identically zero) formal holomorphic mapping \u03bc : (C, 0) \u2192 (Cn , 0) such\n\n\fTRANSVERSALITY OF CR MAPPINGS\n\n25\n\nthat F\u0304 (\u03bc(t), 0) \u2261 0 (see e.g. Lemma 3.32 in [BER00]). Hence, since I(F\u0304 (\u03c7, 0)) is assumed\nnot to have finite codimension, we conclude that there is such a mapping \u03bc(t). If we\ne 0, 0) \u2261 0) that\nsubstitute \u03c7 = \u03bc(t) into the equation (2.3), we conclude (since Q(z,\n(6.10)\n\nG(z, Q(z, \u03bc(t), 0)) \u2261 0.\n\nNow, we claim that the Krull dimension of C[[z, w]]/I(G(z, w)) is > n. Since G(z, 0) \u2261 0,\nwe have that I(G(z, w)) \u2282 I(w), which is a prime ideal. Since C[[z, w]]/I(w) \u223c\n= C[[z]],\nthe Krull dimension of C[[z, w]]/I(w) is equal to n. Thus, to show that the Krull dimension of C[[z, w]]/I(G(z, w)) is > n, we must show that there is a prime ideal p such\nthat I(G(z, w)) \u2282 p \u2282 I(w) and p 6= I(w). Let R : (Cn+1 , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) be the formal\nholomorphic mapping R(z, t) = (z, Q(z, \u03bc(t), 0)) and \u03c8 : C[[z, w]] \u2192 C[[z, t]] be the ring\nhomomorphism defined by \u03c8(h) = h \u25e6 R. Put p := ker \u03c8. Then, p is a prime ideal and\nI(G(z, w)) \u2282 p by (6.10). Moreover, since R(z, 0) = (z, Q(z, 0, 0)) = (z, 0), it follows that\np \u2282 I(w). To complete the proof, we must show that p 6= I(w). To see this, observe that\nby definition wi \u2208 p if and only if Qi (z, \u03bc(t), 0) \u2261 0. But, the latter is equivalent to saying\nthat q\u03b1i (\u03bc(t)) = 0, for all multi-indices \u03b1. This cannot happen, for every i = 1, . . . d, since\nM is essentially finite (which, as the reader should recall, means that the ideal generated\nby all the q\u03b1i (\u03c7) has finite codimension in C[[\u03c7]]). This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nf at 0, then it is also Segre finite\nProof of Theorem 6.1. If H is transversally regular to M\nby Theorem 6.4. It follows from Theorem 3.1 that H is CR transversal, and the conclusion\nof Theorem 6.1 follows from Proposition 6.3 and Lemma 6.2 (iii).\n\u0003\nWe would like to point out that there is no assumption of finite type on either M or\nf\nM in Proposition 6.3 or in Theorem 6.4.\nBy using Theorem 6.1, we can give a sufficient condition on M that guarantees that\nevery finite formal mapping sending M into another generic submanifold of the same\ndimension is a formal biholomorphism.\nTheorem 6.5. Let M be a formal generic submanifold through 0 \u2208 CN and assume that\nM is finitely nondegenerate and of finite type at 0. Then any formal finite holomorphic\nf\nmapping H : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) sending M into another formal generic submanifold M\n(through 0) of the same dimension is a local formal biholomorphism.\nProof. Since a finite mapping H satisfies Jac (H) 6\u2261 0 (see e.g. [BER99a], Theorem 5.1.37),\nf is of finite type at 0. Moreover, Lemma 6.2\nit follows from Proposition 2.3(a) that M\n(i) implies that H is transversally regular . Hence, by Theorem 6.1 the multiplicity of H\ndivides the essential type of M at 0. Moreover, by Proposition 11.8.27 in [BER99a], M\nis essentially finite and Ess 0 (M) = 1. This proves that mult (H) = 1, which means that\nH is a formal biholomorphism.\n\u0003\nWe note that the condition of finite nondegeneracy in Theorem 6.5 cannot be replaced\nby the weaker condition of essential finiteness. Indeed, consider H : (C2 , 0) \u2192 (C2 , 0)\n\n\f26\n\nP. EBENFELT AND L. P.

Closing remarks and proofs of Theorems 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.\nFor the proofs of Theorems 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, we shall assume, without loss of generality,\nf \u2282 CN as formal generic submanifolds and\nthat p0 = p\u03030 = 0. We shall regard M, M\nH : (CN , 0) \u2192 (CN , 0) as a formal holomorphic mapping, as explained in Section 2.\nTo prove Theorem 1.1, we observe from Lemma 6.2 (i) that any finite formal mapping\nis Segre finite. Theorem 1.1 is now a direct consequence of Theorem 3.1. Theorem 1.2 is\nan immediate consequence of Theorem 6.5.\nFor Theorem 1.3 the implication (ii) =\u21d2 (i) follows immediately from Theorem 1.1, as\nalready observed in the introduction. The remaining implication (i) =\u21d2 (ii) follows from\nProposition 6.3 and Lemma 6.2 (iii). We should point out that the assumption that M\nis of finite type at 0 is not needed for (i) =\u21d2 (ii). To prove Theorem 1.4, we observe that\nthe statement \"h is finite\" means exactly that H is Segre finite, as noted in Section 6.\nTheorem 1.4 now follows from Theorem 3.1.\nWe conclude this paper with a few remarks and questions.
