This in itself is rather\npuzzling in view of the fact that the arguments in favour of it being\na problem are rather vague and heuristic, while quantitative arguments have been presented against the claim that it is a problem, at\nleast for some classes of cosmological models (e.g. Coles & Ellis\n1997; Lake 2005). The flatness problem is one of the main motivations for the inflationary scenario (Guth 1981). Of course, if there\nis no flatness problem (or, indeed, even if there were no motivation at all for inflation), this does not mean that inflation could not\nhave occurred. However, it does mean that inflation should not be\ntaken as given based on the belief that it explains away the flatness\nproblem and thus without it classical cosmology leads to absurd\nconclusions.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 I present the\nbasic equations needed in the rest of the paper, mainly to define\nmy notation (unfortunately, there is not a uniform notation in the\nliterature) and give an overview of the entire cosmological parameter space relevant to the discussion. Section 3 gives a brief historical overview of the flatness problem and some qualitative arguments against it. In Section 4 I discuss a new quantitative argument\nregarding cosmological models which will collapse in the future.\nSections 5 and 6 discuss previous quantitative results by others for\nother classes of cosmological models. Section 7 summarizes the\nresults for all cosmological models.\n\n2 BASIC COSMOLOGY\nI assume that, at the level of detail necessary, the universe can be\ndescribed by the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u0131\u0302tre equation\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: helbig@astro.multivax.de\n\nc 2012 RAS\n\n8\u03c0G\u03c1R2\n\u039bR2\n+\n\u2212 kc2\n(1)\n3\n3\nwith the dimensionless constant k equal to \u22121, 0, +1 depending\non spatial curvature (negative, vanishing or positive, respectively);\nR is the scale factor (with dimension length) of the universe, G the\ngravitational constant, \u03c1 the density, \u039b the cosmological constant\n(dimension time\u22122 ) and c the speed of light. It is useful to define\nthe following quantities:\n\u1e582 =\n\nH\n\n:=\n\n\u1e58\nR\n\n\u03bb\n\n:=\n\n\u039b\n3H 2\n\n\u03a9\n\n:=\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1crit\n\nK\n\n:=\n\n\u03a9+\u03bb\u22121\n\nq\n\n:=\n\n\u2212R\u0308R\n\u1e582\n\n\u2261\n\n8\u03c0G\u03c1\n3H 2\n\n\u2261\n\n\u2212R\u0308\nRH 2\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03a9\n2\n\n\u2212\u03bb\n\nwhich are all dimensionless except that H has the dimension\ntime\u22121 . H is the Hubble constant, \u03bb the normalized cosmological constant, \u03a9 the density parameter, k = sign(K) and q is the\n3H 2\ndeceleration parameter.1 For \u03bb = 0 and k = 0, \u03c1 = \u03c1crit = 8\u03c0G\n.\nThis density is 'critical' in the sense that, for \u03bb = 0, a greater\n(lesser) density implies a positive (negative) curvature and a universe (assumed to be expanding now) which will collapse in the future (expand forever); similarly, for k = 0, a greater (lesser) density\nimplies a negative (positive) cosmological constant and a universe\n(assumed to be expanding now) which will collapse in the future\n(expand forever). However, in the general case (k 6= 0 and \u03bb 6= 0),\n1 q > 0 implies that the universe is decelerating; the minus sign is included\nin the definition since at the time of its invention it was assumed that \u03bb = 0\nwhich implies that q > 0 (or q = 0 in the case of a universe devoid of\nmatter).\n\n\f\u03c1crit doesn't have any special meaning, though \u03a9 remains a useful parameter. Equation (1) can be rearranged, using the definitions\nabove, to give\n\n8\n\nc sign(K)\n,\np\nH\n|K|\n\n7\n\n(2)\n\nthus R is positive for k = +1 and negative for k = \u22121; for k = 0,\nR can be defined as Hc .\nIt can be useful to express equation (1) with the values of the\ndimensionless parameters as observed now, denoted by the suffix\n0.

One states that if \u03a9 \u2248 1\ntoday, then in the early universe it was arbitrarily close to 1; the assumption is that some 'mechanism' is needed to explain this 'finetuning' (e.g. Guth 1981). (It is usually not stated but almost always\nassumed that no fine-tuning would be necessary if \u03a9 were not \u2248 1\ntoday.) The other states that if \u03a9 changes with time, then we should\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n3\n\nbe surprised that \u03a9 is (still) \u2248 1 today (e.g. Lake 2005). In other\nwords, the problem is that the mechanism whereby \u03a9 is forced to\nbe \u2248 1 is unknown. Solving one of these variants of the flatness\nproblem does not necessarily solve the other variant.\n[Historically, the flatness problem was first discussed during a\ntime when \u03bb was thought to be zero. Thus, most discussions took\nthis as given. As mentioned above, in this case \u03a9 = 1 corresponds\nto k = 0, i.e. a flat universe, hence the name 'flatness problem'\nfor the question why the universe is (nearly) flat today considering that \u03a9 evolves away from \u03a9 = 1 (k = 0) with time. If \u03bb\nis not constrained to be zero, then the flatness problem should be\nre-phrased as the Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem, i.e. the question is\nwhy the universe is (in some sense) close to the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model (which is an unstable fixed point and a repulsor) today\nwhen |\u03bb| and \u03a9 can take on values between 0 and \u221e. However, for\nbrevity I will continue to use the term 'flatness problem' even for\nthe more general case and sometimes mention only the change in\n\u03a9 with time. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind (though\nit doesn't change the thrust of the argument in all cases) that the\ndiscussion should really be about the Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem.]\nOne possible 'solution' to the flatness problem is simply to\nclaim that \u03a9 \u2261 1. In this case (for \u03bb = 0), since \u03a9 doesn't evolve\nwith time, no explanation is needed as to why \u03a9 \u2248 1 today; in\nother words, we don't have to worry about living at a special time.\nOf course, the fact that \u03a9 just happens to be 1 is thought by some to\nbe improbable in some ill-defined sense, so it is more convincing if\nthere is some mechanism, such as inflation, which produces \u03a9 = 1\nto at least a very good approximation, rather than having to rely on\nthe lucky coincidence of living in a cosmological model in which \u03a9\ndoes not change with time. (Of course, the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model\nis now ruled out by observations. Before this was the case, the argument '\u03a9 must be exactly 1 because if not it will evolve away to to an\narbitrarily large or arbitrarily small value' was indeed used.) However, this solution does not work in practice, as has been pointed\nout by Guth (1981) and Coles & Ellis (1997): even if our universe\nis described by the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model when averaged over\nlarge scales, this is obviously not the case on smaller scales; any\ndeviations from the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model would then grow with\ntime, even if the entire universe were still, on average, described by\nthe Einstein\u2013de Sitter model, so that we would not expect our observable universe to be described exactly by the Einstein\u2013de Sitter\nmodel at a 'random' time.\nNote that a flat universe (k = 0, \u03a9 + \u03bb = 1) doesn't really\noffer much of an advantage. Though it is true that if \u03a9 + \u03bb = 1\nthen this equation always holds, while in general the sum is timedependent, the same argument can be applied to the value of \u03a9 in\nthe flat case as in the case of \u03bb = 0. In other words, although it\nis true that in a flat universe \u03a9 + \u03bb doesn't change with time, \u03a9\nitself suffers from the same 'problem' it does in the \u03bb = 0 case\n(except in the special cases of the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model and the\nde Sitter model). Thus, for the flatness problem in the broader sense\nof the term (i.e. understanding why \u03a9 \u2248 1 today), the cosmological\nmodel favoured by observations (\u03bb0 \u2248 0.7, \u03a90 \u2248 0.3, k = 0 to\nvery good precision) is actually worse than the Einstein\u2013de Sitter\nmodel, even if it were exactly flat.\nAnother solution discussed by Coles & Ellis (1997) is to deny\nthat it is a problem that we live at some special time in the history\nof the universe, since it is not equally likely that we could live at\nany time; this is of course the weak anthropic principle. While the\nweak anthropic principle certainly plays some role in determining\nthe probability of observing given values of the cosmological parameters, it is not obvious that it can quantitatively explain why our\n\n\f4\n\nP. Helbig\n\nuniverse is so close to the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model. In any case,\nmost people would probably prefer an explanation which doesn't\nrely on the anthropic principle. I shall return to the weak anthropic\nprinciple in Section 6. [Note that a perfectly spatially flat universe\nis always perfectly spatially flat, and thus does not suffer from the\n'special time' problem with regard to flatness (though one might\nneed some explanation for the perfect flatness itself). However,\nit still suffers from the Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem (except in the\ncases of the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe and the de Sitter universe\nin which there is no evolution of \u03bb and \u03a9).]\nOne definition of a 'special time' is a time such that the radius of curvature is comparable to the distance to the (particle or\nevent) horizon or the radius of the Hubble sphere. Since in general\nthese quantities are not simply proportional and evolve differently\nwith time, it could be seen as a coincidence (possibly needing explanation) if they are comparable. A perfectly flat universe with an\ninfinite radius of curvature doesn't have this problem since the radius of curvature is always infinite. However, this 'advantage' of\na flat universe is not so much a solution to the time-scale problem\nas a statement that it doesn't exist (with respect to the evolution of\nthe curvature radius) in such a universe; one could still ask what\n'causes' the universe to be spatially flat. Also, as noted above, a\nspatially flat universe still suffers from the 'Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem'. (This coincidence problem is similar to, but distinct from, the\nflatness problem. If at all, it exists only for \u03bb = 0 and \u03a9 < 1. I plan\nto discuss this in a future paper. As is shown below, this class of\nmodels is somewhat atypical with respect to the flatness problem;\nthis is also the case for the coincidence problem. Since \u03bb = 0 was\na common assumption when these problems were first discussed,\nsometimes particular features of this class of models are mistaken\nfor generic features of Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre models.)\nThese three 'solutions' to the flatness problem \u2013 \u03a9 \u2261 1 (and\n\u03bb \u2261 0), k = 0, anthropically selected special time \u2013 are thus unsatisfactory. Are there any satisfactory ones?\n3.1 The qualitative flatness problem: Is a fine-tuning of\ninitial conditions required?\nThe flatness problem is often presented as a fine-tuning problem\n(e.g. Guth 1981): if \u03a9 is near 1 to day, then at some time tfine in the\npast it must have been 1 to a very high accuracy. I refer to this sense\nof the flatness problem as the 'qualitative flatness problem'. This\nargument is completely bogus, as has been pointed out by many authors (e.g. Coles & Ellis 1997; Lake 2005): all non-empty models\nbegin their evolution at the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model, so of course\nthe further back in time one goes, the 'more finely tuned' \u03a9 is. The\npoint is, within the context of classical cosmology, there is nothing\nspecial about a time tfine chosen so that \u03a9 is very close to 1 at that\npoint. Times such as the Planck time are often used in examples\nof the flatness problem, but not only is the Planck time irrelevant\nwithin purely classical cosmology but also there is no known theory which predicts the likelihood distribution of \u03a9 values at this\n(or any other) time. This should be obvious from the fact that for\nany value of \u03a9 today, one can choose a time tfine such that \u03a9 is as\nclose to 1 as desired. In other words, the flatness 'problem' would\nstill exist if \u03a9 were appreciably greater or less than 1 today, only\nthe time tfine for a given degree of fine tuning would occur at an\nearlier time. (Why this is less mysterious for many people is not\nclear to me.) Thus, the 'problem' still remains. (Also, the degree of\nfine tuning required for there to be a 'problem' is not well defined,\nbut is arbitrary and subjective.) Alternatively, if the problem is seen\nas a problem connected with the observed value of \u03a9, then the fact\n\nthat it exists for many other values as well, indeed for all values,\ncould lead to the conclusion that it is not a problem at all. This is\nthus a qualitative argument against the existence of the qualitative\nflatness problem.\nEvrard & Coles (1995) (see also Coles & Ellis 1997) also\npoint out that the assumption implicit in the qualitative flatness\nproblem, namely that some wide range of \u03a9 values are a priori\nequally likely at some early time, constitutes a prior which is incompatible with the assumption of minimal information. This can\nbe regarded as a quantitative solution to the qualitative flatness\nproblem (or, perhaps, an argument against its existence).\nThe qualitative flatness problem thus does not exist; it is\nmerely a consequence of the way in which a universe, described\nby the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u0131\u0302tre equation, evolves and how dimensionless observable quantities such as \u03a9 are defined. Suppose one is\nstanding at the bottom of the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa and\nobserves a cannonball dropping past one's face to the ground. In\nsome absolute sense it is travelling slowly (its speed is much less\nthan the speed of light, say). One can measure the acceleration and\ncalculate that, at a time tfine in the past, its velocity must have been\nextremely 'finely tuned' to almost zero. In fact, at a finite time in\nthe past, its velocity was zero, and at that time it was at a particular place (say, the top of the tower). What's more, other objects\nwhich, due to the effects of air resistance, are falling past one at\nother speeds are all found to be 'finely tuned' so that their velocity\nwas 0 at a given time in the past (and for all objects, the height at\nthat time is the same).\nObviously, there is nothing at all puzzling about this scenario.\nNevertheless, this is the type of 'evidence' which is often presented\nfor the 'existence of the flatness problem', with \u03a9 taking the place\nof velocity (being 1 at the beginning and not 0, of course). Argument from analogy can be misleading, so one should put more faith\nin quantitative arguments.\nIn the above case, the solution is obviously to be found in the\ninitial conditions: Galileo is dropping objects from the top storey.\nIn fact, in the cosmological case the lack of a need for fine-tuning\nis even more obvious. While Galileo could give the objects an initial velocity rather than just dropping them, any non-empty bigbang universe described by the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u0131\u0302tre equation always begins arbitrarily close to the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model. There\nis no need for fine-tuning since there is no possible range of values\nat the initial time. See Section 3.2 for the discussion of a somewhat\nbetter, but still flawed, analogy. Nevertheless, even if it is not a puzzle why \u03a9 = 1 at early times, one can still ask whether we should\nbe surprised that \u03a9 \u2248 1 today.\n3.2 The quantitative flatness problem: Should we be\nsurprised that \u03a90 \u2248 1?\nWhat is the relation between the two forms of the flatness problem discussed above? Within the context of classical cosmology,\nthe first statement, that the universe was arbitrarily close to the\nEinstein\u2013de Sitter model near the beginning, is almost always true.\n(It is always true for non-empty big-bang models. For empty models, similar arguments apply: For \u03bb < 1, the starting point is not the\nEinstein\u2013de Sitter model but rather the Milne model (\u03bb = \u03a9 = 0).\nFor \u03bb > 1 the starting point is the de Sitter model (\u03bb = 1 and\n\u03a9 = 0), although these are not big-bang but rather bounce models.\n(The limiting case of the de Sitter model itself can be thought of\nas a big-bang model in which the big bang occurred in the infinite\npast.) Another non\u2013big-bang model is the static Einstein model. At\nfirst sight, this model seems completely different than the Einstein\u2013\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fThe flatness problem in classical cosmology\nde Sitter model. However, mathematically both are unstable fixed\npoints. Interestingly, Eddington (1930) argued that this is a mark\nagainst the Einstein model, since it is unstable (thus unlikely to\nhold in a realistic universe): the attraction due to gravity and the\nrepulsion due to the cosmological constant are exactly balanced.\nSince the density of matter decreases if the universe expands and\nvice versa, it is unstable not only to changes in the value of the\ncosmological constant or the density per se, but also to departures\nfrom the static state. The Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe is unstable in\nexactly the same sense: as long as it is not perturbed, the values\nof the cosmological parameters remain constant; if they are even\nslightly different, they evolve away from the pure Einstein\u2013de Sitter state. Of course, in some sense this is not a problem since if we\nassume that the universe is exactly described by the Friedmann\u2013\nLema\u0131\u0302tre equation, then the behaviour at all times is fixed; there is\nno way to perturb it. On the other hand, if only because the universe\nis not completely homogeneous, the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u0131\u0302tre equation\ncannot be exact, so the objection is a valid one. Interestingly, the\nsame argument is rarely used against the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe, even though mathematically both are unstable fixed points\nand hence suffer from the same weakness. [In fact, the argument\nis turned around: because the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe is unstable, if the observational constraints on the cosmological parameters\ndescribing our universe are compatible with the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model, it is much more probable that our universe is described\n(almost) exactly by the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model, rather than one\nnearby in the parameter space. Of course, the caveats regarding\n'probable', 'almost' and 'nearby' mentioned above make this an\ninvalid line of argument.] In both cases, a universe described exactly by the model in question would be stable (but would contain\nno cosmologists, since these presumably require inhomogeneities,\nand of course could not be perturbed from 'outside the universe')\nwhile a realistic universe would be at least locally unstable even if\nthe model were an accurate description of a large-scale average. Of\ncourse, the static Einstein universe was ruled out observationally\nbefore the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe was, but while observational\narguments themselves are essential, they should not influence what\nshould be purely theoretical or mathematical arguments.) As discussed above, this can be interpreted to mean that this aspect of the\nflatness problem exists for all cosmological models (i.e. regardless\nof what values we observe for \u03bb0 and \u03a90 ), which means that in this\nrespect there is nothing special about our universe, or that it is not a\nproblem at all, but just a consequence of definitions. Obviously, the\nsecond form of the problem (If \u03a9 evolves, even to arbitrarily large\nvalues in a finite time, should we be surprised if it is \u2248 1?) holds\nonly if \u03a9 \u2248 1 today; on the other hand, holding that the first form\nis not a problem (which, as outlined above, I am not alone in claiming) does not automatically solve the second problem. The rest of\nthis paper is concerned mainly with the second form: should we be\nsurprised that \u03a9 \u2248 1 today? This 'quantitative flatness problem' is\nmore subtle, but also has solutions within the context of classical\ncosmology.\nAn analogy often used in discussing the flatness problem is\nthat of a tightrope walker (e.g. Coles & Ellis 1997; Coles 2009):\nThe Einstein\u2013de Sitter model corresponds to the balanced tightrope\nwalker. As long as he stays balanced, he will stay where he is. However, a slight deviation will grow, quickly bringing the tightrope\nwalker far from the tightrope. If one walks by a circus tent at an arbitrary time and looks inside, one would expect to find the tightrope\nwalker either balanced on the tightrope or on the ground after having fallen; it is extremely improbable that one would just happen\nto see him during his fall. The ground corresponds to one of the\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n5\n\nextreme values of \u03a9 (\u221e or 0). Every statement of the quantitative\nflatness problem essentially follows this example. Were it a valid\nanalogy, then there would indeed be a quantitative flatness problem. In the following sections, I will show quantitatively why the\nanalogy is wrong and hence why there is no quantitative flatness\nproblem.\n\n4 COSMOLOGICAL MODELS WHICH COLLAPSE IN\nTHE FUTURE: A NEW SOLUTION TO THE\nFLATNESS PROBLEM\nAll cosmological models (assumed to be expanding now) with \u03bb <\n0 will collapse in the future: R\u0308 is negative for all values of R and\nfor large R is proportional to R. Models with \u03bb = 0 will collapse\nfor \u03a9 > 1. In addition, models with \u03bb > 0 will collapse provided\nthat \u03a9 > 1 (which in this case implies K > 0, i.e. k = +1), q > 0\nand \u03b1 < 1, where\n\u03b1 = sign(K)\n\n27\u03a92 \u03bb\n4K 3\n\n(10)\n\n(Stabell & Refsdal 1966; Lake 2005). (The A1 and A2 curves mentioned above have \u03b1 = 1.) In Fig. 1, these are in the area between\n\u03bb = 0 and the A1 curve. Empty big-bang models start arbitrarily\nclose to the Milne model with (\u03bb,\u03a9) values of (0, 0); non-empty\nbig-bang models start arbitrarily close to the Einstein\u2013de Sitter\nmodel with (\u03bb,\u03a9) values of (0, 1). The evolution of \u03bb and \u03a9 can be\nviewed as trajectories in the parameter space: \u03bb and \u03a9 evolve from\nthe starting point to infinity and return along the same trajectory.\n[For the definitive discussion, see Stabell & Refsdal (1966); a very\nuseful visualisation can be found at Leahy (2003).] Note that such\ntrajectories do not intersect; this means that a trajectory is uniquely\ndetermined by measuring \u03bb and \u03a9 at any one time (practical is of\ncourse doing so now).\nThe fact that \u03bb and \u03a9 evolve to \u221e (and back) in a finite time\nimmediately illustrates what is wrong with the tightrope-walker\nanalogy for these models: the proper analogy for a universe which\nwill collapse in the future would be a tightrope walker who, if he\nfalls off the tightrope, doesn't stop when he hits the ground, but\nrather continues through the Earth and to infinity and back, finally\napproaching the tightrope from below until he is ultimately almost\nbalanced again. It should be immediately obvious that in this case\nall values of \u03bb and \u03a9 cannot be equally probable. Making the analogy more quantitative, it turns out that the tightrope walker actually spends most of his time between the rope and the floor, thus\nwe should not be surprised to find him somewhere between the\ntightrope and the ground when we look inside the tent. In other\nwords, there is no quantitative flatness problem in these models.\nTo quantify this, I have calculated the quotient of the age of the\nuniverse now and at the time of maximum expansion as a function\nof \u03bb and \u03a9. The age of the universe is given by\nt=\n\nR(t)\nZ\n0\n\ndR\n\nr\n\n\u1e5802\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03a90 R0\nR\n\n+\n\n(11)\n\u03bb 0 R2\nR2\n0\n\n\u2212 K0\n\n\u0011\n\nwhich follows from equation (3). For the current age, the upper\nlimit is given by equation (2); at the time of maximum expansion it\nis found by calculating the (smallest) zero of \u1e582 (since \u1e582 cannot\nbe negative). This is shown in Fig. (4). It is clear that large values of\n\u03bb and \u03a9 occur only during a relatively short time in the history of\nthe universe, near the time of maximum expansion (at the precise\n\n\fP.

While the constraints aren't quite\nas strong here, in the Section 5 I show that a different argument\nrenders many of the models in this part of parameter space unlikely.\nNote that this argument is completely independent of H0 :\nwhatever the value of H0 , i.e. whatever the age of the universe,\nmodels which recollapse have large values of \u03bb and \u03a9 for only a\nrelatively short time.\n\nAn interesting point has been made by Lake (2005), though it is\nimplicit in Stabell & Refsdal (1966): there are many cosmological\nmodels which expand forever in which, although \u03bb and \u03a9 evolve\nwith time, they never stray very far from their initial values. In particular, there are many models for which K is roughly 0 today and\nwhich never deviate very far from this value. Looking at K rather\nthan just \u03a9, these models don't suffer from a flatness problem in the\nrestricted sense, though as mentioned above the same arguments\napply to \u03a9 (and analogously to \u03bb) as apply in the \u03bb = 0 case,\ni.e. they still suffer from the Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem. Nevertheless, if, as observations suggest, K \u2248 0 and 0 < \u03bb0 < 1, then large\nvalues of \u03bb and \u03a9 never occur during the evolution of the universe.\nHowever, this is not really a satisfactory solution, since it assumes\nthe observed values of \u03bb0 and \u03a90 rather than explaining why we\nobserve these or similar values and the Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem\nstill exists (especially in respect to \u03a9 becoming arbitrarily small in\nthe future).\nMore interesting is an argument due to Lake (2005) which\nsolves the Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem as well for models with\nk = +1 which will expand forever. (For models which will expand\nforever, large values of \u03bb and \u03a9 are possible only for k = +1.)\nTrajectories in the \u03bb-\u03a9 plane have a constant of motion given by\nequation (10).3 It seems natural to distinguish cosmological models on the basis of their value of \u03b1. Large values of \u03bb and \u03a9 are\npossible only for \u03b1 <\n\u223c 1. This is shown in Fig. 6. (Note that, for\nclarity, only \u03a9 > 1 is shown!) It is obvious that \u03b1 \u2264 1 is a necessary condition for having infinitely large values of \u03bb or \u03a9. Already\n3 This makes it much easier to plot trajectories than by calculating \u03bb and\n\u03a9 as a function of time, though of course the latter is necessary if one is\ninterested in the amount of time spent during a particular section of the\ntrajectory.\n\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fThe flatness problem in classical cosmology\nfor \u03b1 = 2 the maximum value of \u03bb is just 2 (for \u03a9 = 2) and the\nmaximum value of \u03a9 is \u2248 3.5 (for \u03bb = 1.25).\n\nIn this case, the fine-tuning argument is reversed; only in the\ncase of fine-tuning do \u03bb and \u03a9 become arbitrarily large. [If \u03b1 is\nseen as a free parameter which can take on any value between \u2212\u221e\nand \u221e, then a 'random' value would probably be arbitrarily large,\ncorresponding to K \u2248 0 to a very good approximation. Interestingly, this is what observations seem to indicate: K0 \u2248 0 to within\n(by now quite good) observational accuracy, but with no specially\ninteresting values for \u03bb0 or \u03a90 . For K0 \u2248 0 and \u03bb > 0, \u03bb and\n\u03a9 evolve from (0, 1) (the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model) to (1, 0) (the\nde Sitter model, like the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model a fixed point,\nthough an attractor rather than a repulsor) without any large values\nof \u03bb or \u03a9 along the way; for \u03bb < 0 (in which case the universe\nalways recollapses), large values do occur but, as shown above,\nonly during a relatively short time during the history of the universe.] This demonstrates quantitatively that there is no quantitative flatness problem regarding arbitrarily large values of \u03bb or \u03a9\nfor models which expand forever. [Some models which recollapse\nbut which have \u03bb > 0 also have \u03b1 \u2248 1; this provides an additional argument against the existence of the flatness problem in\nthese models which complements that made in Section 4 (where,\nfor \u03bb \u2248 0, that argument is somewhat weaker).] This argument\nis also independent of the value of H0 . However, all non-empty\nmodels which expand forever asymptotically approach the de Sitter\nmodel at (\u03bb, \u03a9) = (1, 0). Thus, one final aspect of the quantitative\nflatness problem remains: \u03a9 can become arbitrarily small. This is\ninvestigated in the next section.\n\nIf we want to use the tightrope-walker analogy to examine\nlarge values of \u03bb and \u03a9 in models which expand forever, we can\nthink of the ground representing arbitrarily large values of \u03bb and\n\u03a9. However, in this case the tightrope walker is secured by a safety\nline of finite length, which prevents him from reaching the ground\n(and, as he swings back up after his fall, causes the values of \u03bb\nand \u03a9 to decrease). The only way he can reach the ground is in the\nfinely tuned case that his rope is long enough, i.e. infinitely long\n(since the ground corresponds to arbitrarily large values of \u03bb and\n\u03a9).\n\nAnother class of models which expand forever are the bounce\nmodels in which the universe contracts from infinity to a finite size\nbefore expanding forever. For those near the \u03b1 = 1 curve [the A2\ncurve in Stabell & Refsdal (1966)], the same arguments apply as\nfor those on the other side of the curve: only for \u03b1 \u2248 1 are large\nvalues of \u03bb and \u03a9 possible for a significant period of time. These\nmodels begin at the de Sitter model with \u03bb and \u03a9 increasing to\n\u221e in a finite time and return along the same trajectory in the \u03bb-\u03a9\nparameter space, in this respect similar to the models which collapse in the future, thus the argument against the flatness problem\nis similar in the two cases. To be sure, these models have an infinite\nextent in time in both directions, so in this sense there is no flatness\nproblem (or, more precisely, no 'de Sitter problem', analogous to\nthe Einstein\u2013de Sitter problem discussed above) since they are almost always arbitrarily close to the de Sitter model. If we choose\nstarting values for \u03bb and \u03a9 which are not arbitrarily close to the\nde Sitter model, then the argument is completely analogous to that\nfor collapsing models.\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n7\n\n6 COSMOLOGICAL MODELS WHICH EXPAND\nFOREVER: THE WEAK ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE\nI have now covered the entire \u03bb-\u03a9 parameter space except for bigbang models with (a) q < 0 (which implies \u03bb > 0) and (b) \u03a9 less\nthan \u2248 2 (all three values of k are possible) and shown that in all\ncases there is no flatness problem. What about this remaining portion of parameter space? Models here all have K \u2248 0 and approach\nthe de Sitter model asymptotically. This means that there is no flatness problem in the restricted sense, as pointed out by Lake (2005).\nHowever, \u03a9 becomes arbitrarily small (and \u03bb arbitrarily close to 1).\nThus, there is still a problem in that we do not observe such values,\neven though they exist for almost the entire (infinite) lifetime of the\nuniverse.\nThis is essentially the question 'if the universe lasts forever,\nthen why are we near the beginning?' Note that this question could\nbe asked at any time. One could leave it at that and say that since\nany finite age is arbitrarily close to the beginning, there is nothing\nspecial about our time and thus no flatness problem in the timescale sense (i.e. the quantitative flatness problem, why is \u03a9 not arbitrarily small today).\nOne can do better by invoking the weak anthropic principle: cosmological parameters can be observed only to have values\nwhich permit the existence of cosmologists. For the first time, the\nanalysis is not independent of H0 . In the de Sitter model, H is constant in time. Hence, in models which asymptotically approach the\nde Sitter model, H approaches a constant value (which is not that\ndifferent from H0 ). If H is similar to the observed value of H0 ,\nthen small values of \u03a9 (and values of \u03bb near 1) occur only in the\nrelatively distant future of the universe. It is difficult to estimate\nthe probability that cosmologists exist at such future times, but it\nis clear that humans in their present form probably won't exist. In\nthis sense, we don't observe an arbitrarily small value of \u03a9 since\nwe probably wouldn't exist in such a universe. This is due not to\nthe small value of \u03a9 itself but rather to the fact that in the far future\nthere will be no main-sequence stars etc. While this is only as satisfactory as any use of the weak anthropic principle, (a) this does not\nmean that the argument is invalid, (b) it is needed only to rule out\narbitrarily small values of \u03a9 (and not arbitrarily large ones, which\nare ruled out by other arguments above) and, (c) as pointed out by\nLake (2005), in the restricted sense there is no flatness problem\n(i.e. K \u2248 0 during the entire lifetime of the universe). Fig. 7 illustrates this: only arbitrarily old models are arbitrarily close to the\nde Sitter model. One can see that arbitrarily small values of \u03a9 (or\nvalues of \u03bb arbitrarily close to 1) occur only when Ht approaches\n\u221e.\nSince the quantity Ht is determined by \u03bb0 and \u03a90 , one could\nhave an arbitrarily young universe arbitrarily close to the de Sitter\nmodel if H0 were arbitrarily large. However, such a universe will\nspend only a short time near the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model, which\nprobably means that structure, and hence cosmologists, would not\nform in such a universe.\n[Since Ht has a finite value (namely 1) for \u03bb = 0 and \u03a9 = 0\nand, for H near the observed value of H0 , the age of the universe\nfor \u03a9 = 0 would be approximately the same as the observed age,\none might get the impression that, for \u03bb = 0, observing an arbitrarily small value of \u03a90 wouldn't be that unlikely. However, this\nis the case for a universe which is exactly described by the Milne\nmodel, which means that it is empty and hence contains no cosmologists. The situation is somewhat different when considering\nthe Milne model as the asymptotic value of a universe with \u03bb = 0\nbut \u03a9 > 0. For \u03bb = 0 and 0 < \u03a9 < 1, the universe approaches\n\n\fP.

Those to the right of \u221e\nmeasure the time since the universe was at its minimum size.\n\nthe Milne model asymptotically and H approaches 0. In this case,\nan arbitrarily small \u03a9 is reached only after an arbitrarily long time,\nso a similar argument applies as in the case for \u03bb > 0: if H now\nis near the observed value of H0 , then this happens in the far future when there are no more main-sequence stars etc. On the other\nhand, if one assumes an age near the current observed age but with\nan arbitrarily small value of \u03a9, then this implies that the universe\nspent only a relatively short time near the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model\nand hence structure formation would be difficult.]\nIf we want to use the tightrope-walker analogy to examine the\nbehaviour at arbitrarily large times in models which expand forever,\nwe can think of the ground representing the de Sitter model. After\nthe tightrope walker falls off, he falls towards the ground, but his\nspeed slows with time, so that he never actually reaches the ground.\n\n7 SUMMARY\nThe qualitative flatness problem, i.e. the puzzle why the universe\nwas arbitrarily close to the Einstein\u2013de Sitter model4 at early times,\ndoes not exist. It is merely a consequence of the way \u03bb and \u03a9 are\ndefined. Neither does the quantitative flatness problem exist: although the cosmological parameters in general evolve with time,\nit is not puzzling that we don't observe extreme values for them\ntoday. In the case of models which will collapse in the future this\nis because large (absolute) values of \u03bb and \u03a9 occur only during\na relatively short time in the lifetime of such a universe, namely\n4\n\nOr, for an empty universe, the Milne or de Sitter model.\n\nnear the time of maximum expansion. \u03bb and \u03a9 can become large\nonly when H becomes small, and this happens only during the time\nwhen the universe is at or near its maximum size. [Arbitrarily small\n(absolute) values, if they occur at all, also occur for only a relatively\nshort time]. For models which will expand forever, large values are\npossible only for k = +1. However, this occurs only for \u03b1 \u2248 1. In\nthis case, the fine-tuning argument is reversed; only in the case of\nfine-tuning do \u03bb and \u03a9 become arbitrarily large. Since all models\nwhich will expand forever asymptotically approach \u03a9 = 0, arbitrarily small values of \u03a9 can occur. Those with \u03bb = 0 (and hence\nk = \u22121) approach the Milne model with \u03a9 = 0; models with\n\u03bb > 0, whatever the value of k, approach the de Sitter model with\n\u03bb = 1 (the Milne and de Sitter models themselves are of course\nstationary points). (If \u03bb = 0 at any time then \u03bb = 0 at all times.\nOtherwise, arbitrarily small values of \u03bb, if they occur at all, occur\nonly for a relatively short time.) However, if H0 has a value similar\nto or smaller than the observed value, small values of \u03a9 will occur\nonly in the far future when anthropic arguments probably make the\nobservation of such a low value of \u03a9 unlikely. While (for \u03bb > 0)\na higher value of H0 would allow a low value of \u03a9 even for an\nage near the observed age, such a universe would have spent only\na very short time during which \u03a9 was not very small, so structure\nformation would have been strongly suppressed.\nIt is interesting to note that the three arguments presented\nhere make it unlikely that we would observe extreme values\nof \u03bb0 or \u03a90 . This automatically solves the so-called coincidence problem, which has been called deeply puzzling (e.g.\nTegmark, Vilenkin & Pogosian 2005).\nAlso interesting is that in the appendix to his seminal paper, Guth (1981) anticipates much of the subsequent discussion.\nHe points out that even though essentially all cosmological models\nbegin arbitrarily close to the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe (the qualitative flatness problem), this still leaves the question as to why the\nuniverse is so close to the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe today (the\nquantitative flatness problem). He also rejects the idea that some\nbasic principle must force the universe to conform exactly to the\nEinstein\u2013de Sitter model on the grounds that this is obviously only\nan approximation in the case of the real universe (see the discussion of this above). He basically recasts the flatness problem as the\nlongevity problem: fine tuning is required in order that the universe\ndoes not recollapse or thin out to extremely low density within a\nvery short time. However, this argument relies on an assumption\nfor the value of H0 , while our arguments do not need this assumption except in the third category. Also, as I have shown here, even\nin an extremely short-lived universe (which of course recollapses),\nextreme values of \u03bb or \u03a9 are observed only during a relatively small\nfraction of the lifetime of the universe.\nIf there is no flatness problem, what does this mean for inflation? If there is no flatness problem (or, indeed, even if there were\nno motivation at all for inflation), this does not mean that inflation could not have occurred. However, it does mean that inflation\nshould not be taken as a given based on the belief that it explains\naway the flatness problem and thus without it classical cosmology\nleads to absurd conclusions. Inflation also solves the monopole and\nisotropy problems. However, the monopole problem seems to be\nmore a problem with theories of particle physics than with cosmology (Narlikar & Padmanabhan 1991) while Barrow (1995) claims\nthat there is no isotropy problem.5 If all of these claims are true,\n\n5 It is, however, debatable whether Barrow's conclusion is as general as he\nclaims or depends too strongly on his assumptions.\n\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fThe flatness problem in classical cosmology\nthen this still does not prove that inflation didn't happen, but the\nnecessity for inflation or something like it is weakened if not destroyed altogether.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank Nils Bergvall, L\u00e9on Koopmans, Rolf Stabell and Erik Zackrisson for comments on the manuscript.
