PACKER, AND KEITH F. TAYLOR\n(Communicated by David R. Larson)\nAbstract. In this paper we use the concept of wavelet sets, as introduced by\nX. Dai and D. Larson, to decompose the wavelet representation of the discrete\ngroup associated to an arbitrary n\u00d7n integer dilation matrix as a direct integral\nof irreducible monomial representations. In so doing we generalize a result of\nF. Martin and A. Valette in which they show that the wavelet representation\nis weakly equivalent to the regular representation for the Baumslag-Solitar\ngroups.\n\n1. Introduction\nSeveral years ago, X. Dai and D. Larson introduced an operator algebraic approach to the study of wavelets, which has proved very useful in the abstract study\nof both wavelets and frames [6]. In particular, their study of local commutant and\nwavelet sets has provided a great deal of impetus for the research of themselves and\nothers [6, 7, 8].\nAlso, L. Baggett, both on his own and together with K. Merrill and other collaborators [1, 2, 3], has promoted a representation-theoretic point of view in the study\nof wavelets and other types of orthonormal bases of L2 (Rn ) associated to discrete\ngroups. In [1], he decomposed the Stone-von Neumann representation of the discrete Heisenberg group on L2 (R) into a direct integral of representations, and in so\ndoing determined whether or not the translates of Gabor functions parameterized\nby certain scales spanned a dense subspace of L2 (R).\nIt is our intention in this paper to use the combined methods of Dai and Larson\n[6] and Baggett [1] to further study the notion of wavelet sets in Rn . Recall from\n[7] that if A \u2208 M (n, Z) \u2229 GL(n, Q) satisfies the condition that all of its eigenvalues\nhave modulus strictly greater than one, it is said to be a dilation matrix. We then\ncan associate to A a unitary dilation operator\nDA f (t) = |det A|1/2 f (At),\n\nReceived by the editors November 15, 1999 and, in revised form, February 24, 2000.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

TAYLOR\n\nand to each v \u2208 Zn a unitary translation operator\nTv f (t) = f (t \u2212 v),\n2\n\nn\n\ndefined for every f \u2208 L (R ).\nRecall that \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (Rn ) is said to be a wavelet for the family of unitary operators\nm\n{DA\n, Tv | m \u2208 Z, v \u2208 Zn } if the family of functions\nm\n{DA\nTv \u03c8 | m \u2208 Z, v \u2208 Zn }\n\nforms an orthonormal basis for L2 (Rn ). Following Dai and Larson, we define a\nwavelet set E with respect to the dilation matrix A to be a subset E \u2286 Rn\nsuch that the normalization in L2 (Rn ) of the characteristic function of E, 1E , is\nthe Fourier transform of a wavelet with respect to the translation and dilation\noperators corresponding to A. Dai, Larson and Speegle have shown in [7] that\nfixing an arbitrary n \u00d7 n integer dilation matrix A, wavelet sets with respect to\nA always exist, and that we necessarily have \u03bc(E) = (2\u03c0)n , for \u03bc the normalized\nLebesgue measure on Rn .\nLet G(DA , Tv ) denote the group in U(L2 (Rn )) generated by the family of operators {DA , Tv | v \u2208 Zn }. Let {ei | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} denote the standard generators for\nZn , so that (ei )j = \u03b4i,j . Then the following standard commutation relations hold:\nTei DA = DA TAei = DA TP nj=1 aj,i ej .\n\nSo G(DA , Tv ) can be viewed in various ways. First, it is a subgroup of U(L2 (Rn )).\nSecond, it can be viewed as a unitary representation of the discrete group having\nn + 1 generators and the following n + n(n \u2212 1)/2 relations:\n\u001a\nQn\na\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\nTei DA = DA j=1 Tenj,i ,\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n.\nTei Tej = Tej Tei ,\nWe note that groups with generators satisfying the relations above contain the\nBaumslag-Solitar groups as a special case; the C \u2217 -algebras associated to such groups\nwere first observed to be related to the theory of wavelets by B. Brenken in Section\n6 of [4]. Finally, letting QA denote the subgroup of Qn defined by\nQA =\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n{A\u2212j v | v \u2208 Zn },\n\nj=0\n\nG(DA , Tv ) can be viewed as the image of a representation of the semidirect product\nof QA and Z, which we will write as QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z. Here for m \u2208 Z, \u03b8(m) is the\nautomorphism of QA defined by\n\u03b8(m)\u03b2 = A\u2212m \u03b2\nfor \u03b2 \u2208 QA , and the group operation in the semidirect product is defined by\n(\u03b21 , m1 ) * (\u03b22 , m2 ) = (\u03b21 + \u03b8(m1 )\u03b22 , m1 + m2 )\nm\nfor (\u03b2i , mi ) \u2208 QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z. One easily checks that the correspondence (\u03b2, m) 7\u2192 T\u03b2 DA\n2\nn\ngives a group isomorphism of QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z into G(DA , Tv ) \u2286 U(L (R )). Thus we\nhave a unitary representation of the discrete group QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z which we term the\nwavelet representation of QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z. We use the following notation for the wavelet\nrepresentation: for (\u03b2, m) \u2208 QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z, let\n\n(1)\n\nm\nW (\u03b2, m) = T\u03b2 DA\n.\n\n\fDECOMPOSITION OF THE WAVELET REPRESENTATION\n\n3059\n\nThen by our remarks above, W : QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z \u2192 U(L2 (Rn )) is just the wavelet representation of QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z.\nIn this paper, we use the wavelet sets of Dai, Larson and Speegle and modify\nthe techniques of Baggett discussed above to decompose the wavelet representation\ndescribed above as a direct integral of irreducible representations of QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z. In so\ndoing we are able to extend and generalize a result of F. Martin and A. Valette [16],\nin which they showed that certain representations of the Baumslag-Solitar groups,\nof which the wavelet representation by the univariate wavelet group associated\nto dilation by 2 is a characteristic example, are weakly equivalent to the regular\nrepresentations of these groups, hence faithful. Our method will use the existence\nof the wavelet sets as proved in [7] to decompose the wavelet representation as\na direct integral of representations over the wavelet set itself. The main work in\nthe proof then comes as identifying the representations in this direct integral as\nmonomial representations, that is, representations induced from characters on the\nnormal subgroup QA of QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z.\nThis paper is an offshoot of the first author's M.Sc. thesis done at the National\nUniversity of Singapore [13]. The third author wishes to thank the Department of\nMathematics and the Wavelets Group at the National University of Singapore for\ntheir hospitality and support during his visit. Finally, we are grateful to Lawrence\nBaggett for useful conversations on the proof of Theorem 3.1.\n2. Using the wavelet set to decompose the wavelet representation\nLet A be a fixed n \u00d7 n integer dilation matrix. We first follow the lead of Dai\nand Larson [6] and study the operators {DA , Tv } in the Fourier domain. Let F\ndenote the Fourier transform on L2 (Rn ), i.e.,\nZ\n\u2212n/2\nF f (\u03be) = (2\u03c0)\nf (t)e\u2212iht,\u03bei dt\nRn\n\nfor f \u2208 L1 \u2229L2 (Rn ), t, \u03be \u2208 Rn , and extending to L2 (Rn ) (which contains L1 \u2229L2 (Rn )\nas a dense subset) by the usual limiting process. Hence for f \u2208 L2 (Rn ), \u03be \u2208 Rn , we\nmay define\nb A f (\u03be) = F DA F \u22121 f (\u03be) = |det B|\u22121/2 f (B \u22121 \u03be),\nD\n\nwhere B = AT , the matrix transpose of A, and\n\nTb\u03b2 f (\u03be) = F T\u03b2 F \u22121 f (\u03be) = e\u2212ih\u03b2,\u03bei f (\u03be),\n\nb A and {Tbv | v \u2208 Zn } in\nwhere \u03b2 \u2208 QA .

[8], where such sets are said to be dilation-congruent to [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0)n ). The\nprototype wavelet set is the subset E = [\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0) \u222a [\u03c0, 2\u03c0) of R corresponding to\ndilation by 2 in R (see [6]).\nGeneralizing the earlier results in [6], Dai, Larson and Speegle have shown in [7, 8]\nthat if A is a dilation matrix, then E is a wavelet set for the dilation associated to\nA if and only if E is a transformation wavelet set for the matrix B = AT , and that\ntransformation wavelet sets always exist for an arbitrary n \u00d7 n dilation matrices\nwith real-valued entries. We concentrate here on the special case where A has\ninteger entries. It is evident from condition (iii) for transformation matrix sets that\nany wavelet set E will satisfy \u03bc(E) = (2\u03c0)n .\nWe now are able to state our main theorem:\nTheorem 2.1. Let A be an n \u00d7 n dilation matrix in M (n, Z) \u2229 GL(n, Q), and\nlet E \u2286 Rn be a transformation wavelet set for the matrix B = AT . Then the\nwavelet representation W of QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z defined in (1) is unitarily equivalent to a direct\nfx | x \u2208 E}, where each W\nfx is an irreducible monomial\nintegral of representations {W\nrepresentation induced from a character on the normal abelian subgroup QA \u22ca\u03b8 {0}\nfx : QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z \u2192 U(l2 (Z))\nof QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z. Indeed, for each x \u2208 E, the representation W\nis defined by\n(3)\n\nfx (\u03b2, m)g](k) = e\u2212ihx,A\n[W\n\nk\n\n\u03b2i\n\ng(k \u2212 m)\n\nfor x \u2208 E, k \u2208 Z and g \u2208 l2 (Z).\n\nWe will prove Theorem 2.1 in several stages. We first construct another Hilbert\nspace isomorphism, which will make the situation more transparent.

For example, if \u03be \u2208 E, \u03c0(\u03be) = \u03be\nand p(\u03be) = 0, if \u03be \u2208 B \u22121 (E), \u03c0(\u03be) = B\u03be and p(\u03be) = 1, etc.\nHaving thus defined the maps \u03c0 and p a.e. on Rn , we now define a measurable\ntransformation \u03c6 : Rn \u2192 E \u00d7 Z a.e. on Rn by\n\u03c6(\u03be) = (\u03c0(\u03be), p(\u03be)).\n\n\fDECOMPOSITION OF THE WAVELET REPRESENTATION\n\n3061\n\nFinally, we let \u03a6 : L2 (Rn ) \u2192 L2 (E \u00d7 Z) be the Hilbert space isomorphism defined\nby\n\u03a6f (x, k) = |det B|k/2 f (B k x)\nfor f \u2208 L2 (E \u00d7 Z).

Here we use the construction of induced representations given in Chapter X of [12]. In this construction, for a locally compact group\nG with closed subgroup H, one first needs a Borel cross section c : H\\G \u2192 G.\nHere, G = QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z, H = QA \u22ca\u03b8 {0} \u223c\n= Z.\n= QA , and the (right) coset space H\\G \u223c\nFurthermore the groups are discrete, and our cross section c is actually a group\nisomorphism defined by\nc(k) = (0, k) \u2208 QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z\nfor k \u2208 Z. We now use c to define a one-cocycle \u03c9 for the right action of G on the\ncoset space H\\G in the standard fashion: \u03c9 : H\\G \u00d7 G \u2192 H \u223c\n= QA is defined by\n\u03c9(k, (\u03b2, m)) = c(k)(\u03b2, m)[c(k * (\u03b2, m))]\u22121\n= (0, k)(\u03b2, m)(0, \u2212k \u2212 m)\n= (A\u2212k \u03b2, k + m)(0, \u2212k \u2212 m)\n= (A\u2212k \u03b2, 0)\nfor k \u2208 H\\G \u223c\n= Z and (\u03b2, m) \u2208 QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z. Then we recall from Chapter X of [12]\nthat given a unitary representation \u039b of the group H on the Hilbert space H, the\n2\n\u223c\ninduced representation IndG\nH (\u039b) has as its representation space L (H\\G) \u2297 H =\n2\nL (H\\G, H) where the measure on H\\G is quasi-invariant under translation by G.\nIf this measure is invariant, then the formula for IndG\nH (\u039b) is given by\n[IndG\nH (\u039b)(x)f ](\u0233) = [\u039b(\u03c9(\u0233, x))f ](\u0233x)\nfor x \u2208 G, \u0233 \u2208 H\\G, f \u2208 L2 (H\\G, H).

This completes the proof of the proposition.\nWe are now ready to finish the proof of Theorem 2.1.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. We have constructed an equivalence between the wavelet\nf of (4), so it only remains to\nrepresentation W of (1) and the representation W\nf\nshow that W is a direct integral of irreducible monomial representations. Now\nin general the theory of direct integrals of measurable fields of Hilbert spaces and\ndirect integrals of unitary representations is very technical (see, for example, [15] for\na reference). But in our situation, the representation space for the representation\nf is L2 (E \u00d7 Z) which can also be viewed as L2 (E) \u2297 l2 (Z), and there are no\nW\ntechnicalities\nR \u2295 involved in showing that this last Hilbert space is exactly the direct\nintegral E (l2 (Z))x dx. With respect to this decomposition of L2 (E \u00d7 Z) it is clear\nf over the measurable subset E is given exactly by the\nthat the decomposition of W\nf\nrepresentations {Wx | x \u2208 E} defined in (3). Finally, Proposition 2.2 has shown\nfx is an irreducible monomial representation\nthat for each x \u2208 E the representation W\nof QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z, and the proof of Theorem 2.1 is complete.\nRemark 2.3. We note here that to prove Theorem 2.1 we did not need to use all\nof the properties (i)\u2013(iii) of transformation wavelet sets. Indeed, all we really used\nwere properties (i) and (ii): we did not need that E be 2\u03c0-translation congruent to\nn\n[\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0)S\n. The pairwise disjointness of the sets {B j (E) | j \u2208 Z} and the fact that\nn\n\u03bc(R \\ j\u2208Z B j (E)) = 0 allowed us to construct the isomorphism of measure spaces\n\u03c6 : Rn \u2192 E \u00d7 Z which was crucial in the direct integral procedure.

The next corollary gives a proof of this result,\noriginally due to Dai and Larson ([6], cf. Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3) which uses the\nframework that we have set up. The main difference between our method and\nthat of Dai and Larson is the slightly more transparent presentation given to the\ne m | m \u2208 Z} as operators which are just translations in the second\noperators {D\nA\nvariable on our realization of the Hilbert space as L2 (E \u00d7 Z).\nCorollary 2.4.

Then \u03c8 = F \u22121 (1E / \u03bc(E))\nis a wavelet for the system {DA , Tv | v \u2208 Zn } if and only if the S\nsets {E + 2\u03c0v | v \u2208\nZn } are pairwise disjoint up to sets of measure zero and \u03bc(Rn \\ v\u2208Zn (E + 2\u03c0v)) =\n0.\nProof.

Since R is the direct integral of the representations\nrepresentation IndQA\nQA \u22ca\u03b8 Z\n(\u03b3), it follows from (6) that R is weakly contained in W, so that W and\nIndQ\nA\nR are weakly equivalent. Finally, as noted in [16], R is faithful since QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z is\namenable, and it follows from the definition of weak equivalence that W is faithful,\nthus generalizing Theorem 8 proved in [16] to the wider class of groups QA \u22ca\u03b8 Z.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
