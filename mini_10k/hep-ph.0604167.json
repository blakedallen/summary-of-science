When all the particles in a hadronic vertex are on-mass-shell, the effective\nfields of the hadrons describe pointlike physics. However, when at least one of the particles in the vertex is off-shell,\nthe finite size effects of the hadrons become important.\nIn this work we study the D\u2217 Ds K and Ds\u2217 DK vertices, which are fundamental to the evaluation of the dissociation\ncross section of J/\u03a8 by kaons when using effective Lagrangians. The supression of charmonium production is one of\nthe most tradicional signatures of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in relativistic heavy ion collisions [1]. The\ndissociation of charmoniums in the QGP due to color screening would lead to a reduction of its production in such\ncollisions. However, using the charmonium suppression as a signature of QGP formation requires the understanding of\nJ/\u03a8 production and absortion mechanisms in hadronic matter, because this suppression may be due to the interactions\nwith the comovers during the collision [2, 3].\nOne of the approaches\nused to study the interaction of charmonium with the hadronic medium, mainly in the low\n\u221a\nenergy region ( s < 10 GeV), is based on effective SU(4) Lagrangians [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This technique, however,\nrequires the detailed knowledge of the form factors in the hadronic vertices. The calculated cross section may change\nby a factor of two if a soft, instead of a hard, form factor is used in the vertices containing charmed mesons.\nThis situation gave us the motivation to start a program to calculate charmed form factors and coupling constants,\nusing the QCD sum rules approach [10]. We have been continuously working on this problem and computing different\nvertices [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. An interesting subproduct of such calculations, [12, 13, 14, 17], was the understanding of the behavior of the off-shell particle probing of the vertex: heavier particles resolves better the structure\nof the vertex, while lighter particles are more suitable for measuring its size. This conclusion is also supported in the\npresent work.\nAs a part of this project we evaluate, in the present calculation, the form factors in the vertices D\u2217 Ds K and Ds\u2217 DK,\nand compare the results with the predictions from the exact SU(4) symmetry [9].\nFollowing the QCDSR formalism described in our previous works [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], we write the three-point\ncorrelation function associated with the D\u2217 Ds K vertex, which is given by\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(K)\n\u2032\n\u0393\u03bc (p, p ) = d4 x d4 y eip *x e\u2212i(p \u2212p)*y h0|T {j\u03bcD (x)j K (y)j Ds (0)}|0i\n(1)\n\u2217\n\nfor K meson off-shell, where the interpolating currents are j\u03bcD = c\u0304\u03b3\u03bc d, j K = is\u0304\u03b35 d and j Ds = ic\u0304\u03b35 s, and\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\u2020\n\u2020\n(Ds )\n\u2032\n\u0393\u03bc\u03bd (p, p ) = d4 x d4 y eip *x e\u2212i(p \u2212p)*y h0|T {j\u03bcK (x)j Ds (y)j\u03bdD (0)}|0i\n\n(2)\n\n\u2217\n\nfor Ds meson off-shell, with the interpolating currents j\u03bcK = \u016b\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 s, j Ds = ic\u0304\u03b35 s, j\u03bcD = \u016b\u03b3\u03bc c, with u, d, s and c\nbeing the up, down, strange and charm quark fields respectively. In both cases, each one of these currents has the\nsame quantum numbers as the corresponding mesons.\nUsing the above currents to evaluate the correlation functions (1) and (2), the theoretical or QCD side is obtained.\nThe framework to calculate the correlators in the QCD side is the Wilson operator product expansion (OPE).

Calling \u03c1i the spectral density for the Dirac structure i, we can\n2\nwrite the correlation function as a double dispersion relation over the virtualities p2 and p\u2032 , holding Q2 = \u2212q 2 fixed.\nTherefore, the amplitudes \u0393i are given by:\nZ u0\nZ s0\n\u03c1i (s, u, Q2 )\n1\n2 \u20322\n2\n,\n(3)\ndu\nds\n\u0393i (p , p , Q ) = \u2212 2\n\u03c0 smin\n(s \u2212 p2 )(u \u2212 p\u2032 2 )\numin\n2\n\nwhere the spectral density \u03c1i (s, u, Q2 ) equals the double discontinuity of the amplitude \u0393i (p2 , p\u2032 , Q2 ). The amplitudes\nreceive contributions from all terms in the OPE. The leading contribution comes from the perturbative term, shown\nin Fig. 1. The phenomenological side of the sum rule, which is written in terms of the mesonic degrees of freedom, is\nparametrized in terms of the form factors, meson decay constants and meson masses. The QCD sum rule is obtained\nby matching both representations, using the universality principle.

(1) and the D\u2217 and K mesons to the matrix element in Eq. (2). We introduce\nthe meson decay constants fK , fDs and fD\u2217 , which are defined by the following matrix elements:\nh0|j K |Ki =\nh0|j Ds |Ds i =\n\nm2K fK\n,\nms + mq\n\n(6)\n\nm2Ds\nfD ,\nmc + ms s\n\n(7)\n\n\u2217\n\nh0|j\u03bdD |D\u2217 i = mD\u2217 fD\u2217 \u01eb\u2217\u03bd ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u03bd is the polarization vector of the D\u2217 meson.\nIn principle, we can work with any Dirac structure appearing in the amplitude in Eqs. (1) and (2). However, there\nare some points that one must follow: (i) the chosen structure must also appear in the phenomenological side and\n(ii) the chosen structure must have a stability that guarantees a good match between the two sides of the sum rule.\nThe structures that obey these two points are p\u2032\u03bc , in the case K off-shell, and p\u2032\u03bc p\u2032\u03bd in the case Ds off-shell. The\ncorresponding phenomenological amplitudes in these structures are\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm2Ds + Q2\nfD\u2217 fDs fK mD\u2217 m2Ds m2K\n(K)\n(K)ph 2 \u2032 2\n2\n2\n1+\n\u0393\n(p , p , Q ) = gD\u2217 Ds K (Q )\n(9)\nm2D\u2217\n(mc + ms )ms (p2 \u2212 m2Ds )(p\u2032 2 \u2212 m2D\u2217 )(Q2 + m2K )\nfor the K off-shell, and\n2\n\n(D )\n\n\u0393(Ds )ph (p2 , p\u2032 , Q2 ) = gD\u2217sDs K (Q2 )\n\n(\u22122)ifD\u2217 fDs fK mD\u2217 m2Ds\n(mc + ms )(p2 \u2212 m2D\u2217 )(p\u2032 2 \u2212 m2K )(Q2 + m2Ds )\n\n(10)\n\nfor Ds off-shell.\nIn the case of K off-shell the contribution of the quark condensate vanishes after the double Borel transform. In\nthe case of the Ds off-shell, the quark condensate does not contribute to the chosen structure.\nTo write the sum rules we equate each phenomenological amplitude in Eqs. (9)\u2013(10), with the expression obtained\nby substituting the corresponding spectral density in Eqs. (4)\u2013(5) into Eq. (3). The matching between both sides is\n2\nimproved by performing a double Borel transformation [18] in the variables P 2 = \u2212p2 \u2192 M 2 and P \u20322 = \u2212p\u2032 \u2192 M \u20322 .\n(M)\nWe get then the final form of the sum rule, which allow us to obtain the form factors gD\u2217 Ds K (Q2 ) appearing in\nEqs. (9)\u2013(10), where M stands for the off-shell meson.\nWe use Borel masses satisfying the constraint M 2 /M \u20322 = m2in /m2out , where min and mout are the masses of the\nincoming and outcoming meson respectively. In the case of the K meson off-shell, this constraint gives M 2 /M \u20322 =\nm2Ds /m2D\u2217 . For the Ds meson off-shell, the relation should be M 2 /M \u20322 = m2D\u2217 /m2K . However, the small value of the\nK mass spoils the stability of the Borel transformation. Thus, as is common in the literature, we change the K mass\nfor the \u03c1 mass. The resulting relation is then M 2 /M \u20322 = m2D\u2217 /m2\u03c1 .\nThe values of the parameters used in the calculation of the D\u2217 Ds K vertex are despicted in Table I. The continuum\nthresholds s0 and u0 , appearing in Eq. (3), are given by s0 = (min + \u2206s )2 and u0 = (mout + \u2206u )2 , where min and\nmout are the masses of the incoming and outcoming mesons respectively. For the K off-shell we have min = mDs and\nmout = mD\u2217 , and for the Ds off-shell we have min = mD\u2217 and mout = mK (see Fig. 1).\nUsing \u2206s = \u2206u = 0.5 GeV for the continuum thresholds and fixing Q2 = 1 GeV2 , we found a good stability of the\n(K)\nform factor gD\u2217 Ds K , as a function of the Borel mass M 2 , in the interval 3 < M 2 < 5 GeV2 , as can be seen in Fig. 2.\n(D )\n\nIn the case of the form factor gD\u2217sDs K the interval for stability of the sum rule is 2 < M 2 < 5 GeV2 , as can be seen in\n\n\f4\nFig. 3. Fixing \u2206s = \u2206u = 0.5 GeV and M 2 = 3 GeV2 , we evaluate the momentum dependence of both form factors.\n(K)\nThe results are shown in Fig. 4, where the squares corresponds to the gD\u2217 Ds K (Q2 ) form factor in the interval where\n(D )\n\nthe sum rule is valid. The triangles are the result of the sum rule for the gD\u2217sDs K (Q2 ) form factor. In the case of the\nK meson off-shell, our numerical results can be parametrized by an exponencial function (dotted line in Fig. 4):\nQ2\n\n(K)\n\ngD\u2217 Ds K (Q2 ) = 2.83 e\u2212 4.19 .\n\n(11)\n\nAs in Ref.[13], we define the coupling constant as the value of the form factor at Q2 = \u2212m2M , where mM is the mass\nof the off-shell meson. For the K off-shell case the resulting coupling constant is:\n(K)\n\ngD\u2217 Ds K = 3.01.\n\n(12)\n\nIn the case when the Ds meson is off-shell, our sum rule results can be parametrized by a monopole formula (solid\nline in Fig. 4):\n(D )\n\ngD\u2217sDs K (Q2 ) =\n\nQ2\n\n9.01\n,\n+ 6.86\n\n(13)\n\ngiving the following coupling constant, obtained at the Ds pole:\n(D )\n\ngD\u2217sDs K = 3.02.\n\n(14)\n\nComparing the results in Eqs.(12) and (14) we see that the method used to extrapolate the QCDSR results in both\ncases, K and Ds off-shell, allows us to extract values for the coupling constant which are in very good agreement with\neach other.\nIn order to study the dependence of these results with the continuum threshold, we vary \u2206s = \u2206u in the interval\n0.4 \u2264 \u2206s = \u2206u \u2264 0.6 GeV, as can be seen in Fig 5. This procedure give us uncertainties in such a way that the final\n(K)\n(D )\nresults for the couplings in each case are: gD\u2217 Ds K = 3.02 \u00b1 0.15 and gD\u2217sDs K = 3.03 \u00b1 0.14.\n\u2217\nNow we study the Ds DK vertex.

[22] in order\nto obtain the Ds\u2217 decay constant.\nUsing \u2206s = \u2206u = 0.5 GeV for the continuum thresholds and fixing Q2 = 1 GeV2 , we found a good stability of the\n(K)\nsum rule for gDs\u2217 DK , as a function of the Borel mass M 2 , in the interval 2 < M 2 < 5 GeV2 , as can be seen in Fig. 7.\n(D)\n\nIn the case of gDs\u2217 DK , the interval for stability is also 2 < M 2 < 5 GeV2 , as can be seen in Fig. 8.\nFixing \u2206s = \u2206u = 0.5 GeV and M 2 = 3 GeV2 in both cases, we calculate the momentum dependence of the form\n(K)\nfactors which are shown in Fig. 9. The squares corresponds to the gDs\u2217 DK (Q2 ) form factor in the interval where the\n(D)\n\nsum rule is valid. The triangles are the result of the sum rule for the gDs\u2217 DK (Q2 ) form factor. In the case when the\nK meson is off-shell, our numerical results can be parametrized by an exponencial function (dashed curve in Fig. 9):\nQ2\n\n(K)\n\ngDs\u2217 DK (Q2 ) = 2.69 e\u2212 4.39 .\n\n(23)\n\nThe coupling constant was obtained as the value of the form factor at Q2 = \u2212m2K . In this case the resulting coupling\nconstant is\n(K)\n\ngDs\u2217 DK = 2.87.\n\n(24)\n\nIn the case when the D meson is off-shell, the sum rule result is represented by the triangles in Fig. 9, and they can\nbe parametrized by a monopole formula (solid line in the figure):\n(D)\n\ngDs\u2217 DK (Q2 ) =\n\n7.78\n,\nQ2 + 6.34\n\n(25)\n\n\f8\n\n5\n\np'\n\nstructure\n\n2\n\n(Q =1 GeV )\n\n4\n\ng\n\n(K)\n\nD\n\n*\n\n2\n\ns\n\nD K\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n2\n\nM (GeV )\n\n(K)\n\nFIG. 7: Stability of gD \u2217 DK (Q2 = 1 GeV2 ), as a function of the Borel mass M 2 .\ns\n\n5\n\np'\n\np' structure\n\n2\n\n(Q =1 GeV )\n\n4\n\nD\n\ns\n\n2\n\ng\n\n(D)\n\n*\n\nD K\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n2\n\nM (GeV )\n\n(D)\n\nFIG. 8: Stability of gD \u2217 DK (Q2 = 1 GeV2 ), as a function of the Borel mass M 2 .\ns\n\ngiving the following coupling constant, obtained at the D pole:\n(D)\n\ngDs\u2217 DK = 2.72.\n\n(26)\n\nStuding the dependence of our results with the continuun threshold, for \u2206s,u varying in the interval 0.4 \u2264 \u2206s,u \u2264\n0.6 GeV, as can be seen in Fig. 10, we obtain the following values, with errors, for the couplings in each case:\n(K)\n(D)\ngDs\u2217 DK = 2.87 \u00b1 0.19 and gDs\u2217 DK = 2.72 \u00b1 0.31.\n\n\f9\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\nK off-shell Sum Rule,\n\nExponential fit\n\nD off-shell Sum Rule,\n\nMonopole fit\n\n3.0\n\ns\n\n2.0\n\ng\n\nD\n\n*\n\nD K\n\n2\n\n(Q )\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n2\n\nQ (GeV )\n\n(D)\n\n(K)\n\nFIG. 9: gD \u2217 DK (squares) and gD \u2217 DK (triangles) form factors as a function of Q2 from the QCDSR calculation of this work.\ns\ns\nThe dashed (solid) line corresponds to the exponential (monopole) parametrization of the QCDSR results for each case.\n\n3.5\n\nD off-shell\n\ns\n\nK off-shell\n\ns\n\n3.0\ns\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n=0.5\n\nu\n\n=0.6\n\nu\n\n=0.4\n\nu\n\ns\n\n2.0\n\ng\n\nD\n\n*\n\nD K\n\n2\n\n(Q )\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 10: Dependence of the form factor with the continuum threshold, for K and D off-shell cases.

For each case we have considered two particles off-shell, the lightest and one of the heavy ones:\nthe K and Ds mesons for the D\u2217 Ds K vertex, and the K and D mesons for the Ds\u2217 DK vertex. In the two situations,\nthe off-shell particles give compatible results for the coupling constant in each vertex. The results are:\ngD\u2217 Ds K = 3.02 \u00b1 0.14\ngDs\u2217 DK = 2.84 \u00b1 0.31\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\n\f10\nWe can compare our result with the prediction of the exact SU(4) symmetry [5, 7, 9], which would give the following\nrelation among these numbers [9]: gD\u2217 Ds K = gDs\u2217 DK = 5. Eqs. (27) and (28) shows that the coupling constants in\nthe vertices D\u2217 Ds K and Ds\u2217 DK are consistent one with the other, but that they are relatively far from the value\ngiven by the SU(4) symmetry in the cited reference. Therefore, we conclude that the SU(4) symmetry is broken\nby approximately 40% in the calculation performed here. We can also extract the cutoff parameter, \u039b, from the\nparamentrizations in Eqs. (11) and (23) for K off-shell, Eq. (13) for Ds off-shell and Eq. (25) for D off-shell. We get\n\u039b \u2248 2.07 GeV for the K meson off-shell , \u039b \u2248 2.61 GeV for the Ds meson off-shell, and \u039b \u2248 2.51 GeV for the D\nmeson off-shell. Comparing the values of the cutoffs, we see that the form factor is harder if the off-shell meson is\nheavier, implying that the size of the vertex depends on the mass of the exchanged meson: the heavier is the meson,\nthe more as a point like particle is its behavior when probing the target, as observed in Refs. [12, 13, 14, 17].\nAcknowledgements: This work has been supported by CNPq and FAPESP.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n\nT.
