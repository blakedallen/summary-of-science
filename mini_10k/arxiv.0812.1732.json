The latter ones, being phenomenological in nature,\nare inspired by string theory.\nOne of the brane models that have received most attention in recent years is the so called Dvali-GabadadzePorrati (DGP) brane world [4, 5]. This model describes a\nbrane with 4D world-volume, that is embedded into a flat\n5D bulk, and allows for infrared (IR)/large scale modifications of gravitational laws. A distinctive ingredient\nof the model is the induced Einstein-Hilbert action on\nthe brane, that is responsible for the recovery of 4D Einstein gravity at moderate scales, even if the mechanism\nof this recovery is rather non-trivial [6]. The acceleration of the expansion at late times is explained here as\na consequence of the leakage of gravity into the bulk at\nlarge (cosmological) scales, so it is just a 5D geometrical\neffect, unrelated to any kind of mysterious dark energy.\nThin brane models are just an idealization of the physical reality. Braneworlds, if they are to be considered\nas models for our world, have to be of finite thickness.1 The aim of the present paper is to show what\nthe consequences are of considering finite-thickness DGP\n\nbraneworlds within the cosmological context. Here we\nfollow the prescriptions of reference [7]. It will be shown,\nin particular, that there arise both, ultraviolet (UV) and\ninfra-red (IR) modifications of the laws of gravity. Actually, assumption of induced gravity on the finite-thickness\nbrane leads to the existence of two different length scales,\nassociated with the crossover length rc and with the\nbrane thickness \u01eb respectively. This fact hints at a possible (unified) geometrical description of early inflation\nand late-time accelerated expansion of the universe.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe thick brane model we are about to investigate rests\nupon the following assumptions (same assumptions as in\nreference [7]):\n\u2022 We consider a finite-thickness brane which is embedded in a five-dimensional (5D), Minkowski flat\nspacetime that is homogeneous and isotropic along\nthree spatial dimensions.\n\u2022 Orbifold (Z2 ) symmetry is assumed along the\nextra-dimension.\n\u2022 It is possible to find a Gaussian normal coordinate\nsystem centered on the middle layer of the brane.\n\u2022 Brane thickness is time-independent.\nThe line element that respects the above listed assumptions is the following:\n\na Electronic\n\naddress: israel@uclv.edu.cu\naddress: tmatos@fis.cinvestav.mx\nHowever, there have been a few works on thick brane models in\nthe bibliography. In [7], for instance, a prescription for what to\nconsider as a four-dimensional observable is given, and a Friedmann cosmology with time-indepenedent brane thickness is investigated. A similar scenario is studied in [8] (see also [9]).\n\nb Electronic\n1\n\n(5)\n\nds25 = gAB dxA dxB = \u2212n2 (t, y)dt2 +\na2 (t, y)\u03b4ij dxi dxj + dy 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, in our Gausian coordinate system, the extradimension is spanned by the coordinate y. The brane\n\n\f2\nis localized between y = \u2212\u01eb/2 and y = \u01eb/2 (\u01eb stands for\nthe time-independent brane thickness), and we use the\nfollowing metric signature: (\u2212 + + + +).\nThe starting point will be the five-dimensional DGP\naction [4, 5]:\n\nS4EH\n\nStot = S5EH + S4EH + Sm ,\nZ\np\nM53\nEH\nd5 x |g5 | R5 ,\nS5 = \u2212\n2\nZ\n2 Z\np\nM\n=\u2212 4\nd4 x dy \u2206\u01eb (y) |g4 | R4 ,\n2\u01eb\nZ\np\nSm = d5 x |g5 | Lm ,\n\nwhere, in correspondence with the symmetries assumed\nhere, the stress-energy tensor for the matter degrees of\nfreedom trapped to the thick brane is necessarily of the\nform2\n\nT AB =\n\n(2)\n\nlim\n\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0227\n,\na\n!\n\u0012 \u00132\nM42\n\u0227\n\u0227 \u1e45\n\u00e4\ni\ni\nU j = \u2212 2 \u2206\u01eb (y) \u03b4j \u2212\n.(6)\n+2\n\u22122\nn \u01eb\na\nan\na\nU 00\n\n1\n\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb/2\n\ndy \u2206\u01eb (y) Q(t, y) =\n\n3M 2\n= 2 4 \u2206\u01eb (y)\nn \u01eb\n\nIII. COSMOLOGY WITH TWO LENGTH\nSCALES: UNIFYING EARLY-TIME AND\nLATE-TIME INFLATION\n\n\u2206\u01eb (y)\n= \u03b4(y),\n\u01eb\n\nthen, in this (thin brane) limit, standard (thin) DGP\nmodel is recovered.\nIn equation (2), S5EH is the five-dimensional Einstein(5)\nHilbert action for the 5D metric gAB , while S4EH is the effective four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action. The 4D\nRicci scalar R4 is constructed from the four-dimensional\n(4)\nmetric induced on a given slice in the thick brane: gAB =\n(5)\ngAB \u2212 nA nB (nA is the normal to the slice). As customary Sm is the action of the matter degrees of freedom.\nAs it is stated in [7], due to the non-null thickness of\nthe brane, there is some arbitrariness in the definition\nof effective four-dimensional quantities that an observer\nliving in the brane would measure. Here we follow the\nsame prescription of [7] that is the simpler one can envisage. Given a 5D quantity Q(t, y), we define its (spatial)\naverage over the brane thickness Q\u0304(t) as follows:\n\nQ\u0304(t) =\n\n(5)\n\nThe other contribution to the energy-momentum UAB =\n(\u2212 M42 (\u2206\u01eb /\u01eb) G4\u03bc\u03bd , 0), comes from the four-dimensional\nscalar curvature R4 induced in the thick brane. The nonnull components of the latter contribution are:\n\nwhere the delta function contribution \u03b4(y) in the thin\nbrane case has just been replaced by \u2206\u01eb /\u01eb. The stepfunction \u2206\u01eb (y) is defined as it follows: \u2206\u01eb = 1, if\n\u2212\u01eb/2 \u2264 y \u2264 \u01eb/2, \u2206\u01eb = 0 otherwise (see [10] for the same\ngeneralization of DGP models to thick brane contexts).\nIt is worth noticing that, since in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0,\n\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n\u2206\u01eb (y)\ndiag[(\u2212\u03c1b , pb , pb , pb ), \u01ebPT ].\n\u01eb\n\nThe basic equation determining the dynamics of the\ncosmic evolution can be written in the following form:3\n\u0014\n\u00152\n\u01eb2\nrc\nC\u01eb2\n\u03b12 \u01eb2 H\u0304 2 = \u2212 \u03ba \u03b7 +\n(1 + 2 )H\u0304 2 + 4 ,\n2\n\u01eb\n\u0101\n\n(7)\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary integration constant, and we have\nused the following definitions (see [7]):\n \u0304\nk2\n\u0227\n, \u03ba \u2261 5 \u01eb\u03c1\u0304b ,\n\u0101\n6\na1/2\n\u03c1b \u0304a2\n.\n, \u03b7\u2261\n\u03b1\u2261\n\u0101\n\u03c1\u0304b \u01012\nH\u0304 \u2261\n\n(8)\n\nThe parameter \u03ba characterizes the thickness of the brane,\nwhile the quantities \u03b1 and \u03b7 characterize the inhomogeneity of the brane along the fifth dimension. The\ncrossover length is defined in the usual way:\n\n\u2212\u01eb/2\n\n1\n\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb/2\n\ndy Q(t, y).\n\n(3)\n\nrc =\n\n\u2212\u01eb/2\n\nIt is the magnitude a 4D-observer living in the brane\nmeasures. In section V we will discuss the implications of\nthis prescription for the physical phenomena associated\nwith the occurrence of two length scales in the model.\nThe 5D Einstein's field equations that are derived from\nthe action (2) are the following (k52 \u2261 M5\u22123 ):\nGAB = k52 T AB |T otal = k52 (T AB + U AB ),\n\n(4)\n\nM42\n.\n2M53\n\nIf we compare equation (7) of the present section with\nequation (15) of reference [7] (assuming spatially flat cosmology with k = 0, and a Minkowski bulk which means\n\n2\n3\n\nSince we have assumed the bulk spacetime to be Minkowski, then\nT AB |Bulk = 0.\nFor details of the derivation of basic formulas see Appendix A.\n\n\f3\n\u039b = 0), we notice that the only difference is in the factor\n1 + 2rc /\u01eb multiplying the averaged Hubble parameter H\u0304\nin the right-hand side (RHS) of (7). In what follows we\nshall explore the consequences of this tiny difference.\nFrom now on, until the contrary is specified, we assume the constant C = 0, which amounts to ignoring the\n\"dark\" radiation term. This will make our analysis more\ntransparent. Equation (7) can then be rewritten in the\nfollowing way:\n\nH\u0304 2 \u2213\n\nk\u0304 2\n2\u03b1\nH\u0304 = 4 \u03c1\u0304b ,\n\u01eb + 2rc\n3\n\nk52 \u03b7\n.\n\u01eb + 2rc\n\n(10)\n\nLet us explore the limits of the modified Friedmann\nequation (9). For \u01eb \u226b rc , we obtain:\nH\u0304 2 \u2213\n\nk\u0304 2\nk2 \u03b7\n2\u03b1\nH\u0304 = 4 \u03c1\u0304b , k\u030442 = 5 ,\n\u01eb\n3\n\u01eb\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the modified \"crossover\" length r\u0304c \u2261 \u01eb/2\u03b1, or\nr\u0304c =\n\n\u03b7 k52 /k\u030442\n.\n2\u03b1\n\nFor an infinite brane thickness (\u01eb \u2192 \u221e), supposing k\u030442 is\nnon-vanishing, we recover standard cosmology with\n\nH\u0304 2 =\n\nk\u030442\n\u03c1\u0304b .\n3\n\nFor \u01eb \u226a rc the cosmic dynamics of the thick brane is\ndictated by the following modified Friedmann equation:\n\nH\u0304 2 \u2213\n\nk\u0304 2\n\u03b1\nH\u0304 = 4 \u03c1\u0304b ,\nrc\n3\n\n(12)\n\nwhere, now, the 4D gravitational constant measured by\na brane observer is given by\n\nk\u030442 =\n\nk52 \u03b7\n.\n2rc\n\nH\u0304 =\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we defined the effective 4D gravitational constant\nmeasured by a brane observer\n\nk\u030442 \u2261\n\nrecover standard DGP cosmology as it should be. Note\nthat, in this case, rc = k52 /2k\u030442 , so that, k\u030442 = M4\u22122 .\nLet us focus on the so called \"self-accelerating\" branch\nof the Friedmann equation (\"-\" sign of the second term\nin the left-hand-side of equations (11) and (12)). Assuming a vanishing averaged energy density in the thick\nbrane \u03c1\u0304b \u2192 0, then, equations (11) and (12) lead to the\nfollowing de Sitter expansion rates:\n\n(13)\n\nIn respect to the thin DGP brane case, the effect of\nthe brane thickness is to modify the crossover length\n(r\u0304c \u2261 rc /\u03b1) and the strength of gravity (13), through\nthe inhomogeneity of the brane along the extra dimension\n(quantified by the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b7). In the thin brane\nlimit \u01eb \u2192 0, since both \u03b1 \u2192 1 and \u03b7 \u2192 1 (a thin brane\nis necessarily homogeneous in the extra-dimension), we\n\n2\u03b1\n\u03b1\n, H\u0304 = .\n\u01eb\nrc\n\n(14)\n\nAs seen, the two de Sitter expansion rates - as measured by a 4D observer - are driven by two different length\nscales: the brane thickness \u01eb, and the crossover length rc ,\nrespectively.4\nThis feature of Thick DGP braneworld cosmology hints\nat the possibility that both, early time inflation, and late\ntime accelerated expansion of the universe, could be explained as an effect of the leakage of gravity into the\nextra-space at early and late times respectively. However,\nfor constant rc and \u01eb, this unification can not be accomplished in a consistent way. One possibility is to consider time-dependent brane thickness. A second possibility is to consider a running crossover length rc = rc (t).\nThe latter case could be associated with induced BransDicke gravity on the thick brane, through replacement of\nrc \u2192 r0 \u03c6, where \u03c6 - the Brans-Dicke scalar field.\nWithin the context of the later possibility, a convenient\nscenario to address unified geometric description of early\ninflation and late time accelerated expansion could be\nthe following. Assume the running crossover length rc (t)\nis a monotonically increasing function of the cosmic time\n(0 \u2264 rc (t) \u2264 r0 ), such that, as expansion proceeds rc\nincreases and, at late times, asymptotes to r0 \u226b \u01eb.\nDuring the course of the early-time cosmic evolution\n(rc \u226a \u01eb), eventually, the stress-energy content dilutes\nand the universe settles in an early de Sitter stage:\nH\u0304 = 2\u03b1/\u01eb. This stage could be identified with the early\ninflationary period inherent in the standard cosmological\nmodel, so that, the brane thickness \u01eb sets the scale at\nwhich early inflation happens. After the early stage of\ninflation, a mechanism for populating again the matter\ncontent of the universe is mandatory, however, here we\ndo not aim at a discussion of this very delicate issue.\nExit from inflation here is natural. Actually, as expansion further proceeds, the running crossover length further increases and, eventually becomes much larger than\nthe brane thickness, so that, r\u0302 = \u01eb + 2rc \u2192 2rc \u2248 2r0 .\nAs a consequence the cosmic dynamics is dictated now\nby the following Friedmann-DGP equation:\n\n4\n\nNotice, from equations (14), that the de Sitter expansion rate is\nalso modified by the inhomogeneity of the thick brane along the\nextra dimension, being quantified by the parameter \u03b1.\n\n\f4\n5\n4.5\n\n1500\n\nLog H\n\nEff.

This stage corresponds to\neffective 4D (intermediate) regime, lasting between the\ntwo (early and late-time) inflationary stages. Eventually,\nas expansion further proceeds, the matter content dilutes\nwith the expansion, so we are led with a late-time period\nof accelerated de Sitter expansion with H\u0304 = \u03b1/r0 . From\nequation (15) it is evident that, for late-time expansion to\nbe accelerating, it is necessary that the crossover length\nrc \u2248 r0 > \u03b1H\u03040\u22121 , where H\u03040 is the present value of the\nHubble parameter. Therefore, according to the present\nscenario of early inflation \u2013 late-time accelerating expansion, it is required the brane thickness to be of the order\nof the inverse of the Hubble parameter during early inflation, while, the crossover length has to be, at least, of\nthe order of the present value of the comoving Hubble\nradius (\u01010 = 1).\nIV.\n\nA TOY EXAMPLE\n\nIn order to illustrate the above discussion on the unified description of early inflation and late-time accelerated expansion as phenomena of purely geometric origin,\nhere we shall study a toy example. We shall consider the\n\n-5\n-5.5\n\nFIG. 2: Comparison between standard Friedmann behaviour\n(gray curve) and effective thick-DGP evolution of the (Log\nof the) averaged Hubble parameter (dark curve) for different\nstages of the cosmic expansion (early times - upper figure, intermediate times - figure in the center, late times - lower figure). Note that, before the onset of early inflation (\u0101 < 0.05),\nand at intermediate times (0.5 < \u0101 < 5), the effective (averaged) cosmology on the thick-DGP brane is indistinguishable\nfrom standard 4D Friedmann behaviour.\n\nfollowing, ad hoc (arbitrarily chosen), evolution for the\naveraged brane matter energy density \u03c1\u0304b , and (running)\ncrossover length rc (thick brane Brans-Dicke scalar field),\nrespectively:5\n\u03c1\u0304b = \u03c10 \u0101(t)\u22123n , rc = r0\n\n\u0101(t)m\n,\n\u0101(t)m + 1\n\n(17)\n\nwhere n, m, \u03c10 , and r0 , are free parameters. The above\narbitrary choice implies that the dynamics of the cosmic evolution is being fixed through the Einstein's field\nequations.\nIn the figure 1 we show a plot of the effective length\nscale r\u0302 = \u01eb+2rc (t) vs the averaged scale factor \u0101. The free\n\n5\n\nHere we consider the self-accelerating branch of the (thick) DGP\nbraneworld only.\n\n\f5\nparameters have been (arbitrarily) chosen to be: \u03c10 = 1,\nn = 1, m = 3, r0 = 1000, and \u01eb = 0.1, respectively.\nTherefore, the difference between the two length scales\nroughly amounts to four orders of magnitude. In the\nreal physical world this difference has to be much more\nsignificant since \u01eb \u223c H\u0304i\u22121 (H\u0304i is the value of the averaged\nHubble parameter at the end of inflation), while r0 \u223c\nH\u03040\u22121 (H\u03040 being the present value of the averaged Hubble\nparameter). However, for our purposes in this section, a\ndifference of four orders of magnitude in the scales will\nbe enough.\nNote that, at early times (\u0101 \u2192 0), rc \u2192 0 \u21d2 r\u0302 \u2192 \u01eb,\nwhile, at late times (large \u0101), given r0 \u226b \u01eb, r\u0302 \u2192 2rc \u2248\n2r0 . For \u0101-s in the range 0 \u2212 0.4, r\u0302 \u2248 \u01eb, so that early-time\nbehaviour is dictated by the following Friedmann-DGP\nequation (a different writing of equation (11)):\n\nH\u0304e\u2212time\n\n\u03b1\n= +\n\u01eb\n\nr\n\nk\u030442\n\u03b12\n+\n\u03c1\u0304b .\n\u01eb2\n3\n\n(18)\n\nAt late times (\u0101-s in the range \u0101 > 1), on the contrary, the\ncosmic dynamics is driven by the modified FriedmannThick DGP equation (12), that can be rewritten in the\nfollowing way\n\nH\u0304l\u2212time\n\n\u03b1\n=\n+\n2rc\n\ns\n\n\u03b12\nk\u0304 2\n+ 4 \u03c1\u0304b .\n2\n4rc\n3\n\n(19)\n\nAt intermediate times (rc \u226b \u01eb, \u03c1\u0304b \u226b \u03b12 /k\u030442 rc2 , \u0101-s in\nthe range 1 < \u0101 < 10), the cosmology is characterized by\n(approximate) standard Friedmann behaviour:\n\nH\u0304F =\n\nr\n\nk\u030442\n\u03c1\u0304b .\n3\n\n(20)\n\nIn the fig.2 we plot the (Log of the) thin DGP averaged Hubble parameter log H\u0304e\u2212time (dark curve), and\nthe (Log of the) standard one log H\u0304F (gray curve), vs the\naveraged scale factor \u0101, for the chosen values of the free\nparameters. Note that for \u0101-s in the range 0.05 < \u0101 < 0.5,\nthe departure from standard Friedmann behaviour is apparent. For earlier times (prior to the onset of early\ninflation) there is a stage of standard (4D) Friedmann\nevolution that, notwithstanding, can be associated with\nstandard Kaluza-Klein picture (infinite brane thickness\nlimit). As expansion further proceeds (1 < \u0101 < 10), the\ncosmic evolution is driven by a second (intermediate) period of effective 4D Friedmann evolution. Actually, note\nin the figure in the center of fig.2, that thick-DGP expansion (dark curve), given by log H\u0304l\u2212time , and standard 4D\nFriedmann evolution (gray curve), given by log H\u0304F , are\nindistinguishable. For \u0101-s larger than (approximately)\n10, the departure from standard Friedmann behaviour is\nagain apparent. This illustrates in a toy example how\nthe two (early-time and late-time) periods of inflation,\nare preceded by two periods of standard 4D Friedmann\n\nbehaviour: one before the onset of early inflation, and\na second one (the intermediate one) between the two\ninflationary stages. The origin of the different periods\nwill be investigated in detail in the next section when we\ncompute the corrections to the Newton's law of gravity\narising from the occurrence of both length scales rc and\n\u01eb.\n\nV.\n\nCORRECTIONS TO THE NEWTON'S LAW\n\nIn standard (thin) DGP braneworlds with an infinite\nsize extra dimension (Minkowski bulk), four-dimensional\nNewtonian gravity is recovered on small scales due to a\nvery subtle mechanism. In fact, due to the infinite extent\nof the extra dimension, and to the fact that the bulk is\nMinkowski flat, there is no normalizable zero-mode graviton in the model. Four-dimensional gravity is reproduced\nas a resonance of the massive KK gravitons [4, 11, 12].\nThe massive graviton contains three additional degrees\nof freedom compared with a massless graviton. One of\nthem is an extra scalar degree of freedom, so that, linearized gravity is described in this model by Brans-Dicke\ngravity with zero Brans-Dicke parameter. However, due\nto nonlinear shielding of the scalar mode, solar system\nconstraints can be evaded [12].\nIn the present thick DGP brane model, in the thin\nbrane limit \u01eb \u2192 0, or, equivalently, when rc \u226b \u01eb, four\ndimensional gravity is recovered in the way explained\nabove. However, due to the possibility for rc to evolve in\na cosmological set up, the opposite situation with rc \u226a \u01eb\nhas to be investigated as well. As we will inmediatelly\nshow this possibility leads to new fenomena that could\nbe associated with early time inflation.\nSince, in the present scenario, the laws of gravity\nare affected by two length scales: the crossover length\nrc = M42 /2M53 and the brane thickness \u01eb, we will pay\ndue attention to the different limits where ultra-violet\n(UV) and infra-red (IR) modifications of these laws arise.\nIn particular, corrections to the Newton's law of gravity\nbecome important in these limits.\nThe 5D Einstein's field equations that are derived from\nthe action (2) are the following (we omit here the matteraction term Sm ):\n\nG5AB\n\np\n|g4 |\n2rc\n\u03bc \u03bd\np\n=\u2212\n\u2206\u01eb (y)G4\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4A\n\u03b4B .\n\u01eb\n|g5 |\n\n(21)\n\nwhere, as already said, rc = M42 /2M53 is the crossover\nlength. The only 4D Poincar\u00e8-invariant solution to (21)\nis flat Minkowski space \u03b7AB = (\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , 1).\nIn order to understand how do corrections to the Newton's law arise in the thick DGP braneworld, it will be\nuseful to explore both the ultra-violet (UV) and the infrared (IR) limits of the graviton propagator computed from\nthe action (2), because, in these limits non-Newtonian\ncorrections become important. As usual we simplify the\n\n\f6\nanalisys by ignoring the tensor structure, i. e., by considering only the scalar propagator G(x, y). The classical\nequation for the Green's function looks like [10]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2rc\nM53 \u220725 +\n\u2206\u01eb (y) \u220724 G(x, y) = \u03b4 (4) (x)\u03b4(y), (22)\n\u01eb\nwhere \u22072N is the flat Laplacian in N dimensions. In Euclidean space we have:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2rc\n2\n2\n2\np \u2212 \u2202y +\n(23)\n\u2206\u01eb (y) p G(p, y) = \u03b4(y),\n\u01eb\np\nwhere p \u2261 p24 + p21 + p22 + p23 (p0 = \u2212ip4 ). The solutions to the latter equations are [10]:\nM53\n\nG(p, y) = A e\u2212p|y| , |y| >\n\n\u01eb\n,\n2\n\n(24)\n\noutside of the thick DGP brane, while\nG(p, y) = B ep\u0302|y| + C e\u2212p\u0302|y| , |y| \u2264\n\n\u01eb\n,\n2\n\n(25)\n\ninside of the thickness\np of the brane. We have introduced\nthe definition p\u0302 \u2261 1 + 2rc /\u01eb p, while A, B, and C, are\noverall constants that can be found from Darmoix boundary conditions [8]. In the present case these conditions\namount just to continuity of the scalar propagator G(p, y)\nand of its first y-derivative along the brane boundaries at\n\u2212\u01eb/2 and \u01eb/2 respectively. We have:\np\u0302 \u2212 p \u2212p\u0302\u01eb\n2p\u0302 (p\u2212p\u0302)\u01eb/2\ne\nC, B =\ne\nC,\np + p\u0302\np\u0302 + p\np \u2212 p\u0302 \u2212p\u0302\u01eb \u22121\n1\n(1 +\ne ) .\n(26)\nC=\n3\n2M5 p\u0302\np + p\u0302\n\ngiven of what to consider as an effective 4D (observable)\nmagnitude, in the present approach we follow the definition of [7] (basically equation (3)). In consequence we\ncan define without ambiguities (in a way consistent with\ndefinition (3) for averaged 4D quatities) the averaged\n(effective) 4D propagator in Euclidean space and, consequently, the effective 4D gravitational potential V\u0304 (r)\na four-dimensional observer trapped on the thick DGP\nbrane would measure (see equation (27)).\nAnother comment has to do with what we understand\nas UV and IR limits in the present thick DGP model.\nHere we refer as the UV-limit to the case when the\ncrossover length is much smaller than the brane thickness: rc \u226a \u01eb. This might be connected with the intuitive fact that, in this limit, the brane thickness \u01eb has to\nplay the role of the physically meaningfull scale at which\n5D effects become important. Since, on the other hand,\nphysical evidence tends to point to small enough \u01eb-s, then\nwe can link this limit with a high-energy (short range)\nregime. On the oposite end it is the IR-limit (properly\nthe standard thin DGP limit), i. e., the situation when\nthe crossover length is much larger than the brane thickness: rc \u226b \u01eb. In this case arguments taken from cosmology point to large rc -s (rc \u223c H0\u22121 , where H0 is the\npresent value of the Hubble parameter). Therefore we\ncan link the latter limit with a low-energy (long range)\nphase.\nWe want to recall at this point that only a cosmological\nscenario where either rc or \u01eb (or both) evolve in cosmic\ntime, can bring us from the early UV-regime into the latetime IR-phase. In the present section we are considering\nconstant \u01eb and rc . The cosmological arguments have been\nalready considered in the former sections.\n\nA=\n\nSince the effective gravitational potential mediated by\nthe scalar mode G(p, y) is determined as:\nV\u0304 (r) =\n\u1e20(x) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\ndt \u1e20(t, r), with\nd4 p ipx 1\ne\n(2\u03c0)4\n\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb/2\n\ndy G(p, y),\n\n(27)\n\n\u2212\u01eb/2\n\nthen the effective (averaged) propagator in Euclidean\nspace will be given by the following expression:\nZ\n1 \u01eb/2\n\u1e20(p) =\ndy G(p, y) =\n\u01eb \u2212\u01eb/2\n\u0011\n2(C \u2212 B)\n2 \u0010\nB ep\u0302\u01eb/2 \u2212 C e\u2212p\u0302\u01eb/2 .\n+\n\u01eb p\u0302\n\u01eb p\u0302\n\nA.\n\nUV-limit\n\nIt is obvious that only in the limits when either rc \u226a \u01eb\nor rc \u226b \u01eb, the corrections to Newton's law become important. In the intermediate regime the standard arguments on non-trivial physics mentioned at the beginning\nof this section apply, so that gravity is effectively fourdimensional, i. e., it is mediated by resonances of the KK\ngravitons.\nLet us first to consider the UV-limit, when rc \u226a \u01eb,\ni. e., the relevant scale is the brane thickness (this limit\nis missing in standard thin DGP models).

The effective 4D gravitational coupling is given by \u1e20N = M\u03044\u22122 , where\nM\u030442 = \u01ebM53 . At length scales \u03bb much larger that\n\u01eb, gravity leaks into the extra space and 5D effects\nbecome important.\n\u2022 In the IR regime (properly thin DGP brane\nregime), due to resonances of the KK gravitons,\ngravity is effectively 4D at length scales \u03bb \u226a\nrc , with effective gravitational coupling \u1e20N =\n\u03c3 \u22121 M5\u22123 . At large (perhaps cosmological) scales\n\u03bb \u226b rc , gravity leaks again into the extra space\nand 5D effects dominate.\nNotice that there can be both a 4D as well as a 5D\nregimes associated with each limit, i. e., in a cosmological setup there could be four stages associated with\npassing from one limit into the other one: i) effective 4D\nbehaviour with gravitational coupling \u1e20N = (\u01ebM53 )\u22121\nat very early times (UV-stage where rc \u226a \u01eb), then ii)\n5D effects dominate at length scales \u03bb \u226b \u01eb. As rc further\nevolves with the cosmic expansion one goes from the UVregime into the IR (standard, thin DGP brane) regime\n(rc \u226b \u01eb). Once the IR stage is reached, gravity is effectivelly 4D with \u1e20N = \u03c3 \u22121 M5\u22123 at length scales smaller\n\n\f8\nthan the crossover length \u03bb \u226a rc (this 4D stage is just\na continuation of the intermediate one). Finally, at late\ntimes, the Universe enters a stage where 5D effects dominate at very large (perhaps cosmological) scales \u03bb \u226b rc .\n\nWe think this can be a nice cosmological scenario to\naddress, in a unified frame, both early inflation and latetime accelerated expansion as phenomena of purely geometrical origin.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nConsideration of finite thickness leads to a very convenient modification of the DGP scenario: there arise\ntwo length scales associated with the brane thickness\nand with the crossover length respectively. A central\nrole in the present approach to thick DGP braneworlds is\nplayed by the prescription of what to consider as a fourdimensional observable [7]. According to this precription,\nspatial average in respect to the extra-dimension is defined through integration over the brane thickness, unlike\nstandard dimensional reduction where integration is performed over the whole extent of the extra-dimension. In\nthe present setup, as in standard thin DGP braneworlds,\nfour-dimensional gravity is mediated by resonances of the\nKK gravitons. Massive KK modes lead to corrections of\nthe Newton law that are appreciable as UV and IR limits\nare attained.\nThese corrections lead us to the conclusion that the\nshort and large range behaviours of the laws of gravity depend on whether length scale dominates: rc or\n\u01eb. Accordingly, there can be two different Newtonian\n(V\u0304 \u223c 1/r) regimes: one at \u03bb \u226a \u01eb (rc \u226a \u01eb), and the other\none at \u03bb \u226a rc (rc \u226b \u01eb). In the same way, one can find\ntwo different \"five-dimensional\" regimes: one at \u03bb \u226b \u01eb\n(rc \u226a \u01eb), and the other one at r \u226b rc (rc \u226b \u01eb). The existence of two stages of \"five-dimensional\" behavior is a\nvery convenient fact to accomodate both early inflation,\nand late-time accelerated expansion of the cosmic evolution, within a unique geometrical picture where both\ninflationary stages are a consequence of the leakage of\ngravity into the extra-space.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefuly acknowledge useful comments by R.\nMaartens.
