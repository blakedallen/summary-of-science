This solid-to-liquid\ntransition, known as unjamming, occurs either on decreasing the confining pressure P , or increasing the applied shear stress \u03c3. Understanding the properties of\nthis transition is a big challenge due to the absence of\nan established theoretical framework for granular materials. A proposed analogy with the glass transition [1] of\nthermal systems has recently triggered the study of the\njamming transition via numerical investigations of systems of soft frictionless particles at zero applied shear\nstress [2], where the only control parameter is the pressure (or the density). As the unjamming transition is\napproached by decreasing the confining pressure, the vibrational spectrum develops an excess of low frequency\nmodes, known as soft\u2013modes, leading to the identification of a length scale which diverges on unjamming [3].\nThis length scale is related to the emergence of an increasingly heterogeneous response as the system moves\ntowards the transition [3]. A different approach to the\nstudy of the unjamming transition has been followed in\na two dimensional numerical study [4] and in a number\nof experiments [5\u20138], where the applied shear stress is\ncontrolled via a spring mechanism, as the one in Fig. 1a.\nA stick\u2013slip motion characterized by a complex slip size\nstatistics [7] is recovered at high confining pressures P\nand small driving velocities Vd . This stick-slip dynamics\nis altered by the presence of noise [9]. Analogous results\nhave been found at fixed strain rate [10, 11].\nIn this Letter we tackle this problem via three dimensional Molecular Dynamics simulations of a model\nof a seismic fault (Fig. 1a), where grains play the role\nof the gouge [5\u20138, 10, 11]. Numerical details are given\nin [13, 14]. The micromecanical mechanisms leading to\nthe transition are analyzed at a level of spatial and temporal resolution not considered before.\nStick\u2013slip dynamics \u2013 For the investigated values\nof the parameters [13], the system is characterized by\nstick\u2013slip dynamics, which we analyse considering that a\n\na\n\n\u2192\n\nVd\n\n\u2193P\n\n200\n\nb\n\nX(t)\n150\n100\n129.55\n\nc\n\n129.54\n\n50\n1000\n10\n10\n10\n\n2000\n\n-4\n-6\n\n10\n10\n\nt\n\n1500\n\nd\n\n-2\n\nn(\u2206X)\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n\u2206X / Lx\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) The system consists of granular particles (light grains) confined between two rigid plates (dark\ngrains) at constant pressure.

Here we describe the analysis performed\non the particular slip occurring at time t \u2243 1600. We\nconsider a replica of the system at time t, and follow its\ntime evolution at zero driving velocity Vd = 0. If the\nreplica made at time t resists to the applied stress, then\nt \u2264 tu . Conversely, if a slip is observed, t > tu . We\ndefine tu as the largest time where no slip occurs, and\nwe identify it (one for each slip) with an accuracy equal\nto the time step of integration of the equation of motion\n\u03b4t [13] (Fig. 2). This procedure is equivalent to a quasistatic simulation [17] around the un-jamming time tu and\ngives the value of the shear stress above which the system\nstarts to flow.\nWe have performed a number of checks which suggest\nthat no structural changes occur at tu . For instance, the\ncomparison of the state of the system at time tu with\nthe one at shortly earlier and later times, shows that no\ncontact breaks at tu . We have also considered the distribution of the parameter \u03bb = |f t |/\u03bc|fn | where ft and fn\nare the tangential and the normal forces. When \u03bb > 1 a\ncontact breaks as the Coulomb condition is violated. The\nmaximum of the probability distribution P (\u03bb) gradually\nmoves toward 1 as tu is approached, indicating the weakening of the solid [4]. However, neither at tu the number\nof contacts with \u03bb \u2243 1 overcomes a given fraction, nor\nthey appear to be spatially organized. The absence of\nstructural changes at tu supports a scenario in which the\nsystem is located in an energy minimum which slowly\nbecomes an inflection point at time tu , and therefore the\n\nsmallest eigenvalue of the dynamical matrix continuously\ndecreases to zero [18, 19].\nEvolution in the force space \u2013 When the system sticks\nand the shear stress increases, no macroscopic motion is\nobserved. However, the system microscopically changes\nsince it sustains an increasing shear stress. The time evolution of the top plate position X(t) (Fig. 3a), consists in\nan elastic deformation, where X(t) increases very slowly\nin time, interrupted by sudden microslips. To characterize the evolution of the system in the force space, we\nintroduce a two time force-force correlation function for\nthe normal forces, defined as\nP\nn\nn\nij |fij (t0 )||fij (t)|\nn\nP\n,\n(1)\nC (t0 , t) =\nn\n2\nij |fij (t0 )|\n\nwhere the sum running over all couples of particles (i, j)\ncorresponds to a spatial average. An equivalent definition holds for the correlation of tangential forces, C tg .\nBeing interested in the unjamming transition of the slip\nevent shown in Fig. 2, here we fix t0 = tu , and consider the evolution of the correlation function C n (tu , t)\nfor earlier times, t < tu (Fig. 3b). The force correlation function C n (and C tg , not shown) exhibits small\njumps in correspondence of microslips (Fig. 3a), revealing the unusual occurrence of bursts in the reorganization of the force network. During these bursts, the energy due to the tangential interaction decreases, whereas\nthe one due to the normal interaction increases. A possible interpretation is in terms of a two force network\nscenario, in which the applied stress \u03c3 is supported by\na stress \u03c3n due to the normal force network, and by a\nstress \u03c3t due to the tangential forces, \u03c3 = \u03c3n + \u03c3t . In\na burst, few contacts break, leading to a decrease of \u03c3t ,\n\u03c3t \u2192 \u03c3t \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3. A microscopic slips is observed since the\nnormal forces quickly adapt and succeed in sustaining the\napplied stress, \u03c3n \u2192 \u03c3n + \u03b4\u03c3. This scenario is supported\nby the inset of Fig. 3b, which shows both C n and C tg\nacross a microslip, with t0 its starting time. C n slightly\nincreases and overcomes 1, while C tg exhibits a sharp\ndrop due to the breaking of several contacts.\nThe force correlation function (Eq. 1) gives also insights into the system evolution during a slip. In Fig. 4 we\nplot C n,tg (tu , t) for t > tu , and for comparison the scaled\ntop plate position (X(t)\u2212X(tu ))/(X(t\u221e )\u2212X(tu )), where\nt\u221e is a time following the slip event, whose precise value\ndoes not influence our results. We first notice that the\nforces evolve on a timescale much shorter than the plate\nmotion. For instance the correlation functions reach the\nvalue 0.1, denoting an almost complete relaxation, when\nthe top plate moved only by 10% of its total displacement. The presence of different time scales in the relaxation process is evidenced by the self-scattering correla2\nP\ntion function F (q, t) = N1\nj exp[iq * (rj (t) \u2212 rj (tu ))] ,\nwhere rj represents the position of the jth particle.

Dashed lines identify the unjamming time tu .\nThe inset show C n and C tg across a microslip at t = 1579.5.\n\nhave considered wave vectors along y, q = (0, q, 0). For\nlarge q, F (q, t) probes small scale relaxation, and coincides with C n (tu , t), as shown in Fig. 4. Conversely, at\nsmall q, F (q, t) relaxes on a time scale comparable to\nthat of the upper plate motion. The relaxation time \u03c4q ,\nF (q, \u03c4q ) = 1/e, indeed increases as q decreases. Moreover, tangential forces decorrelate before normal ones.\nThis can be explained considering the unjamming transition as a buckling-like instability of the chains of large\nnormal forces, which are sustained by weaker tangential\ncontacts. When the weaker sustaining contacts break,\neither the normal forces adapt to sustain the extra load,\nleading to a microslips, or a buckling-like instability occurs, giving rise to a slip. The same quantities can\nbe used to investigate the subsequent jamming transition. To this end, the force network at time t is compared with the force network after the slip event studying C n,tg (t, t\u221e ). Tangential forces correlate after normal\nones, and makes the force network stable.\nResponse to perturbations: slips versus microslips \u2013\nThe correlation length \u03be in equilibrium systems is measured from the response to an external perturbation. The\nsusceptibility, for instance, scales like \u03be 2\u2212\u03b7 near critical\npoints, where \u03b7 is the correlation function critical exponent. Here we measure the response of the system to a\npressure change at the onset of both slips and microslips.\nMore precisely, at each time t we stop the external drive,\nsetting Vd = 0, and introduce a perturbation in the external pressure P , fixed to P \u2032 = P (1 \u2212 \u03b1) for a time interval\n\u03b4tperb = 0.1.

In the unjammed\nphase, the susceptibility is divergent. In the jammed\nphase, it measures the size of the region of correlated\nparticles that respond to the external perturbation, providing an estimate of the correlation length. It is a static\nquantity since the time t only indicates the instant at\nwhich the perturbation is applied. \u03c7\u03b1 can be also defined without setting Vd = 0, provided that the characteristic response time of the system is much smaller than\nthe timescale over which the applied stress varies. For a\nwide range of \u03b1, the response of the system at times far\nfrom tu is linear in the perturbation, since \u03c7\u03b1 does not depend on \u03b1 (Fig. 5). In particular, \u03c7\u03b1 gradually increases\nin time and drops in correspondence to microslips. The\ninset shows that the microslip size \u2206X depends on \u03c7\u03b1\nevaluated just before the slip, as \u2206X \u2243 \u03c7b\u03b1 . This indicates that the size of a microslip is already encoded in\nthe system state. In fact, considering that \u03c7\u03b1 increases\non approaching a microslip, the measured \u03c7\u03b1 provides a\nlower bound for the magnitude of the incoming event.\nAs the unjamming time is approached, the response\nis no longer linear. \u03c7\u03b1 remains roughly constant until\nit abruptly increases at a time which depends on \u03b1, the\nsooner the greater \u03b1. This increase is consistent with a\npower-law divergence. Accordingly at each time, namely\nat each value of the applied shear stress, there is a minimum value of the perturbation intensity for slip triggering. This behavior is in line with the existence of\na minimum threshold amplitude in the deformation associated with seismic waves for earthquake remote trig-\n\n\f4\ntu\n\n\u03c7\u03b1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.005\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10%\n5%\n3%\n2%\n\n\u2206X\n\n0.01\n\n\u03c7\u03b1\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n[4]\n10\n\n-2\n\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\n0\n1550\n\n1560\n\n1570\n\n1580\n\n1590\n\n1600\n\n1610\n\ntime\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Time evolution of the susceptibility\n\u03c7\u03b1 for different \u03b1.

A difference between slips and microslips is\nin how different particles contribute to \u03c7\u03b1 in the sum\nof Eq. 2. Indeed, these contributions are very similar\nfor microslips, and highly heterogeneous for slips. The\npresence of an heterogeneous response is consistent with\nprevious numerical results found at \u03c3 = 0 [3].\nIn conclusion, the absence of precise structural changes\nat the unjamming time, and the bursts observed in\nthe prior dynamics, suggest that the increasing external stress progressively modifies the underlying energy\nlandscape.\nAt each time the system is in an equilibrium position\nwhich can be seen as local energy minimum of an effective energy landscape which depends on the applied shear\nstress. Microslips occur when the local energy minimum\nflattens down as the applied shear stress increases, letting\nthe system fall in a neighbor minimum. If there are no\nclose minima, a slip occurs, and the system jumps to a\nfar away configuration. The deforming energy landscape\npicture also suggests that soft-modes could be found not\nonly when unjamming is approached at \u03c3 = 0 by decreasing the volume fraction \u03c6 [3], but also [21] when\nunjamming is approached increasing \u03c3.\nWe thank A.
