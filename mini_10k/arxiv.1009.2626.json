The\nperformance of graphene in many of these applications\ndepends on the electron-hole generation and recombination rates in graphene. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that are responsible for electronhole generation and recombination in graphene and the\nassociated time scales. Previously, carrier generation and\nrecombination rates in graphene due to Auger scattering and impact ionization and due to optical phonon\nemission and absorption have been reported21,22 . The\nstrong interaction between electrons/holes and plasmons\nin graphene has been used to explain observed features\nin the angled resolved photoemission (ARPES) data17\u201320 .\nIn this paper, we present electron-hole generation and recombination rates due to plasmon emission and absorption. Our results show that the recombination times of\ncarriers due to plasmon emission are in the tens of femtoseconds to hundreds of picoseconds range and depend\nsensitively on the carrier energy, carrier density, temperature, and the plasmon dispersion. The available phase\nspace for plasmon emission is restricted because of energy and momentum conservation requirements and also\nbecause of Pauli's exclusion principle and carriers near\nthe Dirac point have much longer lifetimes compared\nto carriers at higher energies. Plasmons in a graphene\nlayer on a polar substrate (Figure (1b)) hybridize with\nthe surface optical phonons and this hybridization splits\nthe plasmon dispersion into two branches23,24 . We also\npresent generation and recombination rates of carriers\ndue to plasmon emission and absorption in graphene layers on polar substrates. The results presented here, in the\nlight of the previous studies21,22 , indicate that plasmon\nemission is the dominant mechanism for carrier recombination in graphene. Our results are expected to be useful\nin interpreting experimental observations in ultrafast optical studies25\u201332 and in understanding the operation of\ngraphene based optoelectronic devices9,13,38,39 .\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODEL FOR SUSPENDED\nGRAPHENE\n\nWe first consider a graphene sheet in the plane z = 0\nsandwiched by media with free-space permittivity (Figure (1a)), as in the case of suspended graphene33 .

The recombination and generation rates and lifetimes are then calculated using (9), (10), and (11). The dominant contribution to the propagator in (2) comes from the intraband\npart.

If the interband contribution is ignored the error in the calculated plasmon frequency has\nbeen found to be generally small (less than 10%) for small\nplasmon wavevectors. This small error comes with the\nenormous simplicity of having to find zeroes of \u01eb(q, \u03c9) on\nonly the real frequency axis and therefore this approach\nhas been adopted in numerical simulations. The results\nwe present are also not self-consistent in the sense that\nthe quasiparticle density of states have been assumed\nto be that of the non-interacting electron system. It is\nknown that electron-plasmon interaction can modify the\nquasiparticle density of states and generate plasmaron\nbands17 . However, the modification of the quasiparticle\ndensity of states is expected to be small for the electron and hole densities considered in this paper. The\naverage recombination and generation times are defined\n\u22121\nas, \u03c4R\u22121 = R/min(n, p), and \u03c4G\n= G/min(n, p), respectively, where n and p are the electron and hole densities.\nFigure (2) shows the plasmon dispersion in p-doped\ngraphene for different hole densities. Figure (3) shows\nthe calculated lifetime of an electron in the conduction\nband due to spontaneous plasmon emission as a function\nof the electron energy for different hole densities and temperatures in p-doped graphene (Figure (1c)). Note that\nthe electron-hole symmetry in graphene implies that the\nhole lifetimes in n-doped graphene would be identical.\nFigure (3) shows that conduction electrons with energies\nnear the Dirac point have much longer lifetimes compared to the electrons at higher energies. This trend can\nbe understood as follows. Energy and momentum conservation require that an electron with wavevector ~k can\nemit a plasmon with wavevector ~q only if,\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9(q)\n\u2212q\nv\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\u2264k\u2264\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9(q)\n+q\nv\n\n\u0013\n\n(16)\n\n\f4\n3\n\n10\n\nT = 30K, 100K, 300K, 900K\n\n2\n\n10\nTime (ps)\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n12\n\np = 10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\ncm\n\n11\n\n10\n10\n10\n\u22122\nMinority Carrier Density (cm )\n\n12\n\n10\n\nFIG. 5: The average minority carrier (electron) recombination\ntime \u03c4R is plotted as a function of the minority carrier density for different temperatures in p-doped graphene (p = 1012\ncm\u22122 ).

As the electron energy becomes smaller\nthan \u223c60 meV, the allowed phase space for the plasmon wavevectors shrinks significantly for small wavevectors. The probabilities of emission of plasmons of large\nwavevectors are small because the energies of such plasmons are large and the resulting final electron states deep\ninside the valence band are already occupied by valence\nelectrons.\nIn addition,\nn\no numerical simulations show that\nR \u2202\u01eb(q, \u03c9)/\u2202\u03c9|\u03c9(q) in (9) becomes large when \u03c9(q) approaches qv, which happens for very large wavevectors\nand this also reduces the probability of emission of large\nwavevector plasmons.

Figure (5)\nshows the average minority carrier (electron) recombination time \u03c4R plotted as a function of the minority carrier\ndensity for different temperatures in p-doped graphene\n(p = 1012 cm\u22122 ).

Specifically, a substrate\nwith a large dielectric constant could potentially reduce\nthe recombination and generation rates. However, polar materials with large dielectric constants have surface optical phonon modes that couple strongly with the\ngraphene plasmons23 . To study this further, we consider\na graphene sheet at a distance d away from a polar substrate (Figure (1b)). The dielectric constant of the substrate is assumed to be given by the expression,\n\u0012 2\n2 \u0013\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9LO\n\u01ebsub (\u03c9) = \u01ebsub (\u221e)\n(17)\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9T2 O\n2\nHere, \u01ebsub (0)/\u01ebsub (\u221e) = \u03c9LO\n/\u03c9T2 O . The surface optical phonon frequency \u03c9SO is obtained by setting \u01ebsub (\u03c9)\nequal to -1, and equals,\ns\n\u01ebsub (0) + 1\n\u03c9SO = \u03c9T O\n(18)\n\u01ebsub (\u221e) + 1\n\nThe dielectric constant \u01eb(q, \u03c9) of the graphene sheet can\nbe found by placing a test charge in the sheet and finding\nthe resulting potential. The result is,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 1 (\u01ebsub (\u03c9) + 1)e2qd + (\u01ebsub (\u03c9) \u2212 1)\n+\n\u01eb(q, \u03c9) =\n2 2 (\u01ebsub (\u03c9) + 1)e2qd \u2212 (\u01ebsub (\u03c9) \u2212 1)\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nWavevector (1/nm)\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 8: The dispersion of the coupled plasmon-phonon mode\n(solid) in a p-doped graphene sheet on a SiC substrate is\nshown for different hole densities.

Now one finds two longitudinal collective modes.\nIn the q \u2192 0 limit, the lower frequency mode is plasmonlike with \u03c9(q) \u2192 0 as q \u2192 0, and the higher frequency\nmode is phonon-like with \u03c9(q) \u2192 \u03c9SO as q \u2192 0. For large\nwavevectors, the lower frequency mode disappears into\nthe electron-hole continuum while the higher frequency\nmode becomes plasmon-like with \u03c9(q) \u2192 qv as q \u2192 \u221e.\nAs an example, we consider the technologically relevant\ncase of a graphene layer on a Silicon Carbide (SiC) substrate4,23,24 . The values of different parameters are as\nfollows: d = 5 Angstroms, h\u0304\u03c9LO = 120 meV, h\u0304\u03c9T O = 98\nmeV, and \u01eb\u221e = 6.540 . These give h\u0304\u03c9SO \u2248 117 meV.\nFigure (8) shows the dispersions of the coupled plasmonphonon modes for a p-doped graphene sheet on a SiC\nsubstrate for different hole densities. Comparing Figures\n(2) and (8), it can be seen that plasmon-phonon coupling significantly modifies the dispersion and this has\nrecently been verified experimentally23 . The recombination and generation rates can be obtained using the\nsame expressions as those given in (9), (10), and (11)\nwith the exception that contributions from both branches\nof the dispersion must be included. Therefore, surface\noptical phonons of the polar substrate provide an additional channel for carrier recombination and generation.\nIt should be mentioned here that large wavevector surface\noptical phonon modes can also cause intervalley recombination and generation processes22 .

Figure (9) displays the same general trends as\n\ndoes Figure (3) in the case of a suspended graphene sheet.\nHowever, lifetimes are shorter for the low energy electrons\nin the case of graphene on SiC. For electrons with energies near the Dirac point, recombination is entirely due\nto the lower frequency branch of the dispersion which\nfacilitates interband transitions better than the plasmon\ndispersion in suspended graphene. The sharp peaks seen\nin Figure (9) occur when the lifetimes due to the lower\nfrequency branch of the dispersion are becoming longer\nwith the electron energy while lifetimes due to the upper frequency branch are becoming shorter. As in the\nsuspended graphene case, the spontaneous emission lifetimes can range from tens of femtoseconds to hundreds\nof picoseconds. Figure (10) shows the minority carrier\n(electron) recombination time \u03c4R plotted as a function of\nthe minority carrier density for different temperatures in\na p-doped graphene (p = 1012 cm\u22122 ) on a SiC substrate.\nCompared to the suspended graphene case (Figure 5), the\nrecombination times for graphene on SiC are shorter for\nsmall minority carrier densities. Next, we consider the\ncase when the electron and hole densities are the same\n(as is the situation in photoexcitation experiments). Figure (11) shows the recombination times \u03c4R (solid) and\nthe generation times \u03c4G (dashed) plotted as a function\nof the electron and hole density (assumed to be equal)\nfor different temperatures for a graphene sheet on a SiC\nsubstrate. The recombination and generation times in\ngraphene on SiC are generally of the same order as in\nthe case of suspended graphene discussed earlier. The\nrole of the higher dielectric constant of the SiC substrate\nin reducing plasmon-assisted recombination and generation rates, compared to suspended graphene, is compensated by the presence of surface optical phonons which\nnot only modify the plasmon dispersion but also provide\n\n\f7\nan additional channel for recombination and generation.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have presented electron-hole recombination and generation times due to spontaneous\nand stimulated emission and absorption of plasmons in\ngraphene. Our results indicate that plasmon assisted recombination times in graphene can vary over a wide range\nof values ranging from tens of femtoseconds to hundreds\nof picoseconds. In many proposed and demonstrated optoelectronic devices7\u201311,13\u201316,38,39 , the plasmon-assisted\nrecombination and generation rates could be fast enough\nto significantly impact device performance.\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n22\n\nElectronic address: fr37@cornell.edu\nK.
