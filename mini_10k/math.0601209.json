Westbury\nMathematics Institute\nUniversity of Warwick\nCoventry CV4 7AL\n\nAbstract\nWe construct a pivotal category by a finite presentation and show that it is an\nintegral form of the category of invariant tensors of the spin representation of the\nquantum group Uq (B3 ) over the field Q(q).\nKey words: invariant tensors, pivotal category\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we describe the category of invariant tensors of the rank three\nsimple Lie algebra so(7) = B3 as a finitely presented pivotal category; and this\npaper can be considered as a response to (Kuperberg, 1994, Question 3.6). This\nfollows the work of Greg Kuperberg in Kuperberg (1996) which describes the\ncategories of invariant tensors for the rank two simple Lie algebras as finitely\npresented pivotal categories. The most interesting case is the exceptional Lie\nalgebra G2 which is discussed in Kuperberg (1994) and in Westbury (2005).\nThis work was preceeded by the Temperley-Lieb category which gives the\ncategory of invariant tensors for the rank one simple Lie algebra sl(2): a full\naccount of this is given in Frenkel and Khovanov (1997).\nThe spin representation of so(7) is discussed in Patureau-Mirand (2003) and\nGe et al. (1990) and R-matrices are discussed in Hou and Ma (1991) and\nOkado (1990). The main aim of this paper to to give a definition of a finitely\npresented strict pivotal category by using diagrams and the main result is\nEmail address: bww@maths.warwick.ac.uk (Bruce W. Westbury).\n\nPreprint submitted to Advances in Mathematics\n\n9 September 2018\n\n\fthat this category is isomorphic as a strict pivotal category to the category of\ninvariant tensors for this spin representation.\nThis representation has the property that all non-zero weight spaces are one\ndimensional. This implies that the tensor product with any highest weight\nrepresentation is multiplicity free. In particular the tensor product with itself is multiplicity free. This tensor product is the sum of four representations.\nThese representations are the trivial representation, the vector representation,\nthe adjoint representation and the third exterior power of the vector representation.\nThe (quantum) dimensions are\nVector\n\nAdjoint\n\nSpin\n\n[1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1]\n\n[0, 0, 2]\n\n[10][7]\n[5][2]\n\n[12][7][6]\n[4][3][2]\n\n[10][6][2]\n[5][3][1]\n\n[12][10][7]\n[6][4][1]\n\nThe organisation of this paper is that in \u00a72 we give the diagrammatic relations\nwhich are relations for a finitely presented Z[\u03b4]-linear strict pivotal category.\nIn \u00a73 we define a sequence of finitely presented algebras. In \u00a74 we give a diagrammatic model for the crystal graphs of the spin representation, the vector\nrepresentation and their tensor products. In \u00a75 we relate these constructions\nand identify the sequence of finitely presented algebras with the centraliser\nalgebras of the tensor powers of the spin representation. In \u00a76 we prove that\nthe presentations of the centraliser algebras are confluent and in \u00a77 we show\nthat these centraliser algebras are cellular.\n\n2\n\nDiagrams\n\nIn this section we give a finite presentation of a Z[\u03b4]-linear strict pivotal category. There are two types of edge which we draw as a single line and a double\nline. There is just one type of vertex, namely the trivalent vertex with two\nsingle lines and one double line.\n\nThe coefficients in the following equations are written in terms of the quantum\nintegers. Although they may be written as a fraction these rational functions\n2\n\n\fare all Laurent polynomials in q invariant under the involution q \u2194 q \u22121 .\nThis ring can be identified with the polynomial ring Z[\u03b4] by the inclusion\n\u03b4 7\u2192 q + q \u22121 . The following tables can be used to convert all the coefficients\nthat appear to elements of Z[\u03b4].\n\n[4]\n[2]\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n1\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b42 \u2212 1\n\n\u03b4(\u03b4 2 \u2212 2)\n\n[6]\n[3]\n\n[8]\n[4]\n\n[10]\n[5]\n\n\u03b4 2 \u2212 2 \u03b4(\u03b4 2 \u2212 3) \u03b4 4 \u2212 4\u03b4 2 + 2 \u03b4(\u03b4 4 \u2212 5\u03b4 2 + 5)\nThese two sequences of polynomials, {P (k)}, each satisfies the recurrence\nrelation P (k + 1) \u2212\u03b4P (k) + P (k \u22121) = 0 (but with different initial conditions).\nDefine a diagram to be a trivalent graph embedded in a rectangle with boundary points on the top and bottom edges.

Let D\nequivalence classes of such diagrams. The composition of morphisms is given\nby putting one rectangle on top of the other. This category is a strict pivotal\ncategory. The tensor product of morphisms is given by putting the rectangles\ntogether side by side and the dual diagram is obtained by rotating through\nhalf a revolution.\nThis category is referred to as the free strict pivotal category on the trivalent\nvertex since it has the following universal property. Let P be a strict pivotal\ncategory with self-dual objects V and W and a morphism V \u2297 V \u2192 W . Then\ne \u2192 P which maps the\nthere is a unique functor of strict pivotal categories D\ntrivalent vertex to this morphism.\ne and impose relations. This\nThen we take the free Z[\u03b4]-linear category on D\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndefines the category D . This means that D is a Z[\u03b4]-linear strict pivotal\ncategory and that there is a functor of Z[\u03b4]-linear strict pivotal categories\ne \u2192 D \u2032 . The defining relations consist of the basic relations given in Figure\nD\n1, the two square relations given in Figure 2, the pentagon relation given in\nFigure 3 and the hexagon relation given in Figure 4.\ne and D \u2032 are finite sequences of single and double edges. The\nThe objects of D\ncategory D is the full subcategory of D \u2032 whose objects are finite sequences of\nsingle edges.\n\nThis presentation is not confluent. The reason is that the hexagon relation is\nnot a rewrite rule. If we have a hexagon in a diagram then we can obtain a\nsecond diagram by interchanging the single and double edges in the diagram.\nIn order to make the hexagon relation into a rewrite rule we need to know\n3\n\n\f[10][6][2]\n[5][3]\n[10][7]\n=\n[5][2]\n=\n\n=0\n=\n\n[2]2 [6]\n[3]\n\n= [7]\n\n=0\n\n= \u2212[5]\n\nFig. 1.

The matrices\nrepresenting U1 , K1 , H1 and \u03c31\u00b11 are obtained by deleting the first k rows and\ncolumns from the matrix representing the same element in the four dimensional representation.\nThis means that there is a spanning set for AP (3) which consists of the words\n10\n\n\fof length at most two the hexagon H1 K2 H1 and the following four words in\nthe ideal generated by U2 .\nH1 U2 H1 H1 U2 K1\nK1 U2 H1 K1 U2 K1\nThis gives a total of thirty words in the spanning set. The sum of the squares\nof the dimensions of the above representations is thirty and these thirty words\nare linearly independent in this thirty dimensional algebra. This shows that\nthese thirty words are a basis for A(3).\nIt follows from these relations that the criterion of Westbury (1997) is satisfied.\nThis means that\nAP (n + 1) =\nAP (n) + AP (n)Un AP (n) + AP (n)Kn AP (n) + AP (n)Hn AP (n) (8)\nThe first consequence of this is that there is a conditional expectation \u03b5n : AP (n) \u2192\nAP (n \u2212 1). This satisfies Un aUn = \u03b5(a)Un for all a \u2208 AP (n) and is uniquely\ndetermined by the conditions\n[10][6][2]\na\n[5][3]\n\u03b5(aUn\u22121 a\u2032 ) = aa\u2032\n\u03b5(aKn\u22121 a\u2032 ) = aa\u2032\n\u03b5(aHn\u22121 a\u2032 ) = [7]aa\u2032\n\u03b5(a) =\n\nfor all a, a\u2032 \u2208 AP (n \u2212 2). These conditional expectations then determine a\n[5][3]\ntrace map \u03c4n on AP (n) for each n > 0 by \u03c4n+1 (a) = [10][6][2]\n\u03c4n (\u03b5n+1 (a)) for all\na \u2208 AP (n).\nThe second consequence of (8) is that for any n \u2265 0, there is a finite set\nof words in the generators which span AP (n). In fact we can be much more\nspecific.\nDefinition 1 Take an array of integers {a(i, j)|i \u2265 1, j \u2265 1, i + j \u2264 n + 1}\nsuch that 0 \u2264 a(i, j) \u2264 3, a(i, j) \u2264 a(i\u2032 , j) if i < i\u2032 , a(i, j) \u2264 a(i, j \u2032 ) if\nj < j \u2032 . Then associated to this array is the following word in non-commuting\n(k)\nindeterminates Ei where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and 0 \u2264 k \u2264 3\n1\nY\n\nj=n\u22121\n\n\uf8eb\n\nn\u2212j\nY\n\n\uf8ed\n\ni=1\n\na(i,j)\n\n\uf8f6\n\nEn\u2212i\u2212j+1\uf8f8\n\n11\n\n\f(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThen substitute 1 for Ei , Ui for Ei , Ki for Ei , Ki for Ei to get a word\nin the generators of AP (n). We will call these the irreducible words.\nIt is clear that the irreducible words span AP (n) since if we take any irreducible\nword and multiply by a generator then by using the relations we can write this\nword as a linear combination of irreducible words. In fact the irreducible words\nare a basis and we will give two proofs of this; one in \u00a75 using representation\ntheory and one in \u00a76 using the diamond lemma.\nThe third consequence of (8) is:\nLemma 2 For all n > 0, Un AP (n + 1)Un = AP (n \u2212 1)Un .\nPROOF. Let a \u2208 AP (n + 1). Then by (8), a can be written as a linear combination of terms of the form bXn b\u2032 where b, b\u2032 \u2208 AP (n) and Xn \u2208\n{1, Un , Kn , Hn }. Then applying (8) a second time, each b can be written as\na linear combination of elements of the form cYn\u22121c\u2032 where c, c\u2032 \u2208 AP (n \u2212 1)\nand Yn\u22121 \u2208 {1, Un\u22121 , Kn\u22121 , Hn\u22121}. Hence Un aUn can be written as a linear\ncombination of terms of the form\ncUn Yn\u22121 Xn (c\u2032 b\u2032 )Un\nwhere c \u2208 AP (n \u2212 1) and (c\u2032 b\u2032 ) \u2208 AP (n). Each word of the form Un Yn\u22121 Xn\ncan be written as a linear combination of the words\n{Un , Un Un\u22121 , Un Kn\u22121 , Un Hn\u22121 }\nusing the defining relations. This shows that Un aUn is a element of Un AP (n)Un\nand so is an element of AP (n \u2212 1)Un .\n\n4\n\nCrystal graphs\n\nNext we discuss the combinatorics of Littelman paths for the spin representation. The first observation is that the weights of this representation are the\norbit of the highest weight under the action of the Weyl group. This implies\nthat all weight spaces have dimension one and that the Littelman paths are\njust the straight lines from the origin to the weight. Then when we concatenate these paths we get a sequence of weights \u03c91 , \u03c92 , . . . such that for all i > 2,\n\u03c9i+1 \u2212\u03c9i is a weight of the representation. Furthermore the sequence of weights\ncorresponds to a dominant path if and only if every weight in the sequence is\ndominant.\nNext instead of working with the basis consisting of the fundamental weights\nwe change basis by\n12\n\n\f(w1 , w2 , w3 ) 7\u2192 (2w1 + 2w2 + w3 , 2w2 + w3 , w3 )\ns1 \u2212 s2 s2 \u2212 s3\n(s1 , s2 , s3 ) 7\u2192 (\n,\n, s3 )\n2\n2\nIn the new coordinates the weights of the representation are the eight vectors\n(\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b11). Also the dominant weights correspond to vectors (s1 , s2 , s3 ) such\nthat s1 \u2265 s2 \u2265 s3 \u2265 0. This shows that Littelman paths correspond to triples\nof non-crossing Dyck paths.\nThe number of triples of non-crossing Dyck paths is calculated in de Sainte-Catherine and Viennot\n(1986) where it is shown to be\nY\n\ni+j+6\ni+j\n1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264n\nThis sequence appears in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as\nsequence A006149.\nIn this section we use the algorithms introduced in Westbury (2005) to find a\nset of diagrams which gives a basis for the invariant tensors.\nDefinition 3 Assume we are given a diagram. Let A and B be two boundary\npoints which are not marked points. Then a cut path from A to B is a path\nfrom A to B such that each component of the intersection with the embedded\ngraph is either an isolated transverse intersection point or else is an edge of\nthe graph.\nThe diagrams for these four cases and the associated weights are:\n\n(0, 0, 1)\n\n(1, 0, 0)\n\n(0, 1, 0)\n\n(0, 1, 0)\n\nThe weight of a cut path is (a, b, c) if it crosses a double edges transversally, c\nsingle edges transversally and contains b edges. A cut path is minimal if there\nis no cut path with the same endpoints and lower weight.\nNow suppose we have a diagram with n boundary points which are all single\nedges. Then we draw the diagram in a triangle AXY with the edge XY\nhorizontal and with all boundary points on the edge XY . Then we choose\nmarked points X0 = X, X1 , . . . Xn = Y such there is precisely one boundary\npoint between each marked point. Now for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n let \u03c9i be the minimum\nweight such there is a cut path from A to Xi of weight \u03c9i . Then \u03c90 = (0, 0, 0) =\n\u03c9n .\nThe diagram model for the crystal graph of the eight dimensional spin repre13\n\n\fsentation is given in Figure 5 and the diagram model for the crystal graph of\nthe seven dimensional vector representation is given in Figure 6. These crystal\ngraphs are given in (Hong and Kang, 2002, \u00a78.1).\nRemark 4 There is a different interpretation of these labelled directed graphs.\nThese two representations are miniscule which means that the action of the\nWeyl group W on the weights is transitive. The stabiliser of a point is a\nparabolic subgroup W0 . Each coset has a unique representative of minimal\nlength. In these examples W has type B3 ; for the vector representation W0\nhas type B2 and for the spin representation W0 has type A2 . The Weyl group\nof type B3 is generated by the reflections in the three simple roots, s1 ,s2 ,s3 .\nFor each vertex, take a directed path from the highest weight (at the top) to\nthe vertex. Then take the sequence of labels and regard it as a word in the\ngenerators. These words are then reduced expressions for the minimal length\ncoset representative.\nNext we discuss the tensor product rule. This tensor product rule gives a\nprocedure which associates a triangular diagram to any word in the weights of\nthe spin representation and the vector representation. This tensor product rule\nis similar to the tensor product rule given in Westbury (2005). First we draw a\ntriangular grid. The triangles in top row is the sequence of triangles associated\nto the word. This also gives the weights of the edges of these triangles. Next\nwe label each edge of the triangular grid by a dominant weight using the rule\nbelow. This rule is derived from the tensor product of crystals.\nA\nDA (i)\n\nDB (i) \u2212 HA (i)\n\nA\n\nB\nHB (i) DA (i)\n\n0\n\nB\nHB (i)\n\n0\n\nHA (i) \u2212 DB (i)\n\nNow we complete the triangular diagram by drawing a graph in each diamond.\nNote that the weights HA and DB are both elements of the set\n{(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2)}\nThis gives thirty six different diamonds. Furthermore note that for each of\nthese diamonds the other two weights are also elements of this set. This implies\nthat for any word every diamond will have one of these thirty six labellings.\nTherefore to complete the diagram it is sufficient to know how to fill in a\ndiamond with each of these labellings.\nThe general principle for filling in these diagrams is that each edge of the\ndiamond is required to be a minimal cut path whose weight is given by the\nlabel and the diagram is required to be irreducible. By construction the two\n14\n\n\f(0,0,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n3\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,1,0)\n2\n\n3\n(0,1,0)\n\n(1,0,1)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n1\n\n(1,0,0)\n1\n\n3\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(1,0,1)\n\n(0,1,0)\n2\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n3\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,0,0)\n\nFig. 5.

However these come in pairs since any diamond can\nbe reflected in a vertical line. This leaves ten cases which we describe below.\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,0,2)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(1,0,1)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(1,0,1)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,0,0)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,0,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,0,0)\n\nHere are three more cases.\n(0,0,1)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,0,2)\n\n(1,0,1)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,0,2)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,0,2)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\nThis leaves the following four cases\n(0,1,0)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n(1,0,1)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n(1,0,1)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n(0,0,2)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,0,2)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\nNext we associate an element of \u2297n \u2206 to each of these triangular diagrams with\nn points on the top edge. This follows Frenkel and Khovanov (1997). First a\ntriangular diagram interpreted as a tensor is an intertwiner\nV (H) \u2297 V (D) \u2192 \u2297n \u2206\n17\n\n\fso applying this map to the tensor product of highest weight vectors gives an\nelement of \u2297n \u2206.\nConjecture 5 If we write the tensor associated to a triangular diagram in\nterms of the tensor product basis we get an expression of the form\nbD =\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1bb b\u2032T\n\n(9)\n\nb\u2032 \u2264b\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03b1bb \u2208 Z[q, q \u22121 ] and \u03b1bb = 1 if b\u2032 = b.\nThis means that the tensors associated to the triangular diagrams are a basis\nof \u2297n \u2206 and the change of basis matrices are integral and unitriangular. The\nfollowing is a sketch of a proof of this result.\nConsider the diagrams in which only some of the diamonds have been filled in.\nIf we start at the top left corner of one of these diagrams we have a sequence\nof alternating South-East and North-East boundary edges which take us to\nthe top right corner. Each of these edges is labelled by a dominant weight.\nThen the diagram can be considered as map from the tensor product of the\ncorresponding sequence of highest weight representations to \u2297n \u2206. Applying\nthis map to the tensor product of the highest weight vectors gives an element\nof \u2297n \u2206. Then we prove that each of these vectors has the property in (9). The\nproof is by induction on the number of diamonds that have been filled in. If\nno diamonds have been filled in then this construction just gives the tensor\nproduct of the basis vectors. It is this property that determined the diagrams\nwe drew in the first place. The inductive step follows from the observation\nthat if we add one diamond then we multiply by a triangular matrix.\nA corollary of this conjecture is that the diagrams with H = 0 and D = 0\nare a basis of the space of invariant tensors. This corollary follows from the\nresults in \u00a75 and is part of Proposition 23.\n\n5\n\nComparison\n\nThe aim of this section is to explain the relationships between the constructions of the previous three sections.\nLet AD (n) be the endomorphism algebra of n in D. There are algebra homomorphisms AP (n) \u2192 AD (n) for n \u2265 0. This map is defined on the generators\nby (5) and the defining relations for AP (n) are satisfied by construction.\nIn \u00a72 we used trivalent graphs to construct the free strict pivotal category\nf Here we take a more algebraic approach. The full subcategory of D\ne whose\nD.\n18\n\n\fA\n\nV\n\nK\n\nH\n(10)\n\nFig. 7. Generators\n\nobjects are finite sequences of single edges is generated as a category by morphisms Ai : n \u2192 n \u2212 2, Vi : n \u2212 2 \u2192 n, Ki : n \u2192 n and Hi : n \u2192 n. The\ndiagrams for these morphisms are given in Figure 7 and the diagram with\nindex i is obtained by putting i \u2212 1 vertical lines on the left and n \u2212 i \u2212 1\nvertical lines on the right.\nEach morphism is then a composable sequence of these generators and we\ndefine the width of the morphism to be the maximum value of n.\nLemma 6 A diagram in AD (n) of width n can be written as a word in the\ngenerators of AP (n).\n\nPROOF. Since Ui = Vi Ai , this means that we can find a composable sequence of these generators such that every Vi is succeeded by Ai and whose\ndiagram is isotopic to the given diagram. First replace each Vn\u2212k by\n(Vn\u2212k An\u2212k )(Vn\u2212k+1An\u2212k+1 ) . . . (Vn\u22121An\u22121 )Vn\nand replace each An\u2212k by\nAn (Vn\u22121 An\u22121 )(Vn\u22122 An\u22122 ) . . . (Vn\u2212k An\u2212k )\nThen we draw the diagram in the strip 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n + 1 so that for 1 \u2264\nm \u2264 n the object m the x-coordinates of the m points are 1, 2, . . . , m. Then\nin this diagram there is a maximum below each minimum. This means that\nthe maxima and minima are paired by vertical lines which do not intersect\nthe diagram. Then for each pair we perform an isotopy which shrinks this\nvertical line. If each of these vertical lines is sufficiently short then the resulting\ndiagram has the required form.\nLemma 7 For n \u2265 0, AP (n) \u2192 AD (n) is surjective.\n\nPROOF. We show that if k > 0 then a diagram D \u2208 AD (n) of width n + 2k\ncan be written as linear combination of diagrams of width n + 2k \u2212 2. Given\nD add k minima at the top right and k maxima at the bottom right. This\nmeans we repeat the following operation until we get a diagram whose width\nis at most the number of endpoints on the top and bottom edge\n19\n\n\fD\n\nD\n\nThis gives a diagram in AD (n + 2k) of width n + 2k. This can then be written as a word in the generators of AP (n + 2k). This word is of the form\nUn+2k\u22121 aUn+2k\u22121 for a \u2208 AP (n + 2k). This word is an element of AP (n +\n2k \u2212 2)Un+2k\u22121 by Lemma 2 which means that D has been written as a linear\ncombination of diagrams of width n + 2k \u2212 2.\nLet TQ be the Q(q)-linear category of invariant tensors for the spin representation, \u2206. This has objects 0, 1, 2, . . . and a morphism n \u2192 m is a linear map\n\u2297n \u2206 \u2192 \u2297m \u2206 which intertwines the actions of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroup Uq (B3 ). This quantum group is defined to be a Hopf algebra over the\nfield Q(q).\ne\nThen TQ is a strict pivotal category and so by the universal property of D\ne \u2192 T which maps the\nthere is a unique functor of strict pivotal categories D\nQ\ntrivalent vertex to a morphism in TQ from \u2206 \u2297 \u2206 to the vector representation.\nNote that this morphism is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar.\n\nProposition 8 The defining relations for D are satisfied so this functor factorises through D to give a functor of Z[\u03b4]-linear strict pivotal categories\nD \u2192 TQ .\nThis result is the motivation for the relations.\n\nPROOF. Let B3 be the three string braid group. Then B3 acts on the invariant tensors in \u22973 \u2206. The dimensions of these representations are known from\nthe decomposition of \u22973 \u2206. Also the eigenvalues of the standard generators are\nknown. Since each representation has dimension at most five this information\ndetermines the representations by Tuba and Wenzl (2001). This gives the representations \u00a73.2. Given these representations and using the pivotal structure\none can check that the defining relations for D are satisfied.\n\nLet AT (n)Q be the endomorphism algebra of n in TQ . Then in the remainder\nof this section we will use the homomorphisms\nAP (n) \u2192 AD (n) \u2192 AT (n)Q\n\n(11)\n\nto compare these algebras.\nLet DQ be the free Q(q)-linear category on D so DQ = D \u2297Z[\u03b4] Q(q). Then\nfor n \u2265 0 we can define AD (n)Q either as the endomorphism algebra of the\n20\n\n\fobject n of DQ or as AD (n) \u2297Z[\u03b4] Q(q). Then the functor D \u2192 TQ extends to a\nfunctor DQ \u2192 TQ and induces an algebra homomorphism AD (n)Q \u2192 AT (n)Q\nfor each n \u2265 0.\nFor n > 1 we have generators U1 , . . . , Un\u22121 \u2208 AP (n). We also consider these\nas elements of the algebra AP (n)Q and as elements of AT (n)Q using the homomorphisms in (11). Then we define HP (n)Q to be the quotient of AP (n)Q by\nthe ideal generated by these elements and we define HT (n)Q to be the quotient\nof AT (n)Q by the ideal generated by these elements. Then, for n > 0 we have\nan induced homomorphism HP (n)Q \u2192 HT (n)Q .\nIn Wenzl (1990) it is shown that these homomorphisms are isomorphisms.\nFurthermore these algebras are direct sums of matrix algebras and the Bratteli\ndiagram is the same as the Bratteli diagram of the centraliser algebras of\nthe tensor powers of the four dimensional fundamental representation of the\nsimple Lie algebra of type B2 . This representation can be taken to be the\nvector representation of sp(4) or the spin representation of so(5).\nProposition 9 For n > 0, the homomorphism AP (n)Q \u2192 AT (n)Q is surjective.\n\nPROOF. The proof is by induction on n. We have\nAT (n + 1)Q \u223c\n= AT (n)Q Un AT (n)Q \u2295 HT (n)Q\nThe inductive step now follows from the inductive hypothesis and the result\nthat the homomorphism HP (n)Q \u2192 HT (n)Q is surjective.\nCorollary 10 For n > 0, the homomorphism AP (n)Q \u2192 AT (n)Q is an isomorphism.\n\nPROOF. The number of irreducible words in Definition 1 is also dim AT (n)Q .\nHence the observation that the set of irreducible words is a spanning set for\ndim AP (n)Q shows that dim AP (n)Q \u2264 dim AT (n)Q .\nCorollary 11 For all n > 0, the homomorphism AP (n) \u2192 AD (n) is an isomorphism.\n\nPROOF. Corollary 10 implies that this homomorphism is injective. The result follows from this observation and Lemma 7.\nCorollary 12 The strict pivotal functor DQ \u2192 TQ is an isomorphism.\n21\n\n\fPROOF. The categories D and T are strict pivotal and so if n + m = 2p\nwe have canonical isomorphisms HomD (n, m) \u2192 AD (p) and HomT (n, m) \u2192\nAT (p). Since the functor is strict pivotal and induces an isomorphism AD (p) \u2192\nAT (p) it also induces an isomorphism HomD (n, m) \u2192 HomT (n, m).\nIf n + m is odd then HomD (n, m) and HomT (n, m) are both the zero module\nso there is nothing to prove.\n\nThis result can be rephrased to say that the pivotal category D is an integral\nform or order for the category TQ . Another construction of an integral form\nfor TQ is given in (Lusztig, 1993, Part IV). Then Conjecture 5 implies that\nthese two integral forms are equivalent.\n\n6\n\nConfluence\n\nIn this section we apply the theory of rewrite rules to the presentations of the\nalgebras AP (n). This theory originates from the diamond lemma in Newman\n(1942) and our account is based on (Sims, 1994, Chapter 2). This theory has\nbeen applied to the Hecke and Temperley-Lieb algebras in Kang et al. (2002).\nOur approach differs from these standard approaches in that we take AP (n) to\nbe a quotient of the free algebra on a commutation monoid (instead of a free\nmonoid) and we only require a reduction order to be a partial order (instead\nof a linear order).\nLet X be a set and W \u2282 X \u00d7 X a relation. We write x \u2192 y if (x, y) \u2208 W . Let\n\u2217\nthe relation \u2192 be the reflexive transitive closure of the relation W . Let \u2243 be\nthe equivalence relation generated by W .\nThe first result is the following.\nDefinition 13 A rewrite system is confluent if either of the following two\nequivalent conditions is satisfied\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(1) If u \u2243 v then there exists an x such that u \u2192 x and v \u2192 x.\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(2) If u \u2192 x and u \u2192 y then there exists a v such that x \u2192 v and y \u2192 v.\nA rewrite system is locally confluent if whenever u\u2192x and u\u2192y then there\n\u2217\n\u2217\nexists a v such that x \u2192 v and y \u2192 v.\nIt is clear that a confluent rewrite system is locally confluent but there are\nexamples of locally confluent rewrite systems that are not confluent.\n22\n\n\fDefinition 14 A rewrite system is terminal if there is no infinite sequence\nx0 , x1 , . . . such that xi\u22121 \u2192 xi for all i > 0.\n\u2217\n\nNote that if a rewrite system is terminal then the relation \u2192 is a partial order.\n\nProposition 15 A rewrite system that is terminal and locally confluent is\nconfluent.\nNow we apply this to finitely presented algebras. Let K be a commutative\nring and M a monoid. Let KM be the monoid algebra of M over K. Then\nP\nevery element u \u2208 KM can be written uniquely as m\u2208S rm m where S is a\nfinite subset of M and rm \u2208 K \\ {0}. The subset S is called the support of u\nand is denoted by supp(u).\nLet R be a finite set of ordered pairs (p, P ) where p \u2208 M, P \u2208 KM and\np \u2208\n/ supp(P ). Then let I \u2282 KM be the ideal generated by the set {p \u2212\nP |(p, P ) \u2208 R} and let A be the K-algebra KM/I.\nNow define a relation W on the set KM by\nrxpy + u \u2192 rxP y + u\nwhere r \u2208 K \\ {0}, x, y \u2208 M, u \u2208 KM, (p, P ) \u2208 R and p \u2208\n/ supp(u). Then the\nequivalence relation u \u2243 v is the equivalence relation u \u2212 v \u2208 I.\nDefinition 16 An element u \u2208 M is reducible if it can be written as u = apb\nwhere a, b \u2208 M and for some P \u2208 KM (p, P ) \u2208 R. An element u \u2208 M is\nirreducible if it is not reducible.\nLemma 17 The rewrite system W is confluent if and only if A is the free\nK-module on the set of irreducible elements of M.\nThe following Proposition 19 gives a criterion which can be checked by a finite\ncalculation and which implies that the rewrite system is locally confluent.\nDefinition 18 An overlap consists of elements u, v, w \u2208 M together with\nelements P, Q \u2208 KM such that v 6= 1, (uv, P ) \u2208 R and (vw, Q) \u2208 R. This\n\u2217\n\u2217\noverlap is unambiguous if there is an x \u2208 KM such that P w \u2192 x and uQ \u2192 x.\nProposition 19 The rewrite system W is locally confluent if and only if every\noverlap is unambiguous.\nDefinition 20 A reduction order on M is a partial order which is invariant\nunder both left and right translations and such that, for each m \u2208 M, the set\n{m\u2032 \u2208 M|m\u2032 < m} is finite.\n23\n\n\fThen the standard method of showing that a rewrite system is terminal is to\nconstruct a reduction order on M such that for each (p, P ) \u2208 R we have a < p\nfor each a \u2208 supp(P ).\nNext we apply this theory to the presentations of the algebras AP (n).\nDefinition 21 For n \u2265 1 let C(n) be the monoid with the same set of generators as AP (n) and with defining relations the commuting relations. That is,\nfor 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n \u2212 1 with |i \u2212 j| > 1, if a \u2208 {Ui , Ki , Hi } and b \u2208 {Uj , Kj , Hj }\nthen ab = ba.\nLet the type of a word in the generators be the sequence of subscripts. Construct a rewrite system for AP (3) by taking the set of pairs (p, P ) where the\nwords p are the words of type (1, 1) and (2, 2), the words of type (2, 1, 2) and\nthe words of type (1, 2, 1) which are not irreducible words. Then, for each p, we\ncan use the relations to write p uniquely as a linear combination of irreducible\nwords. Then, by construction, this is a confluent rewrite system for AP (3).\nThen, for n > 3, we obtain a rewrite system by taking the union over 1 \u2264 i \u2264\nn \u2212 2 of the sets obtained by changing each subscript 1 to i and each subscript\n2 to i + 1. This gives a finite set of rewrite rules, R(n). Although we have\ndescribed these rewrite rules using words, all of these words are well-defined\nelements of C(n)\nDefine a partial order on C(n) recursively. This definition is similar to the\ndefinition of a wreath product order on a free monoid. On the free monoid\ngenerated by {Ui , Ki , Hi } take the length plus reverse lexicographic order with\nthe generators ordered by Ui < Ki < Hi . Let w be a word in the generators of\nC(n + 1). Then we obtain a word u in the generators {Un , Kn , Hn } by deleting\nall generators whose subscript is not n and a word v in the generators of C(n)\nby deleting all generators whose subscript is n. Now note that u and v \u2208 C(n)\ndepend only on w \u2208 C(n + 1) and not on the choice of word representing\nw. Then let w1 , w2 \u2208 C(n + 1) with corresponding words u1 , u2 and elements\nv1 , v2 \u2208 C(n). Then we define w1 < w2 if u1 < u2 or u \u2212 1 = u2 and v1 < v2 .\nThen this is a reduction order and has the property that if (p, P ) \u2208 R(n) and\na \u2208 supp(P ) then a < p. This shows that the rewrite system W (n) associated\nto R(n) is terminal. Note that the set of irreducible words defined in Definition\n1 coincides with the set of irreducible elements for the rewrite system W (n)\nin Definition 16. It now follows from the theory of rewrite systems that the\nfollowing are equivalent, for any n > 3:\n(1) The rewrite system W (n) for AP (n) is confluent.\n(2) The rewrite system W (n) for AP (n) is locally confluent.\n(3) The Z[\u03b4]-module underlying AP (n) is the free module on the set of irreducible words.\n24\n\n\fThe third property has been proved in Proposition 9 using the representation\ntheory of the quantum group Uq (B3 ) and so we conclude that these rewrite\nsystems are confluent.\nHowever it is also possible to prove that these rewrite systems are locally\nconfluent by directly checking that all overlaps are unambiguous. This depends\non the observation that this holds for any n \u2265 4 if and only if it holds for n = 4.\nThis holds since any overlap can only involve subscripts of the form i \u2212 1, i\nand i + 1 for some i > 1. This case can in principle be checked directly since\nit is a finite calculation. This case can also be checked indirectly by giving a\nfinite dimensional representation in which the irreducible words are linearly\nindependent. This case can also be checked indirectly using a computer algebra\npackage.\n\n7\n\nCellular algebras\n\nFirst we extend the definition of a cellular algebra given in Graham and Lehrer\n(1996) to cellular categories. The basic example is the Temperley-Lieb category\ndiscussed in Westbury (1995). The proof we give here also applies to the\ncategories of diagrams constructed from the rank two simple Lie algebras in\nKuperberg (1996). Further examples are the affine Temperley-Lieb category in\nGraham and Lehrer (1998) and the partition category whose endomorphism\nalgebras are the partition algebras.\nDefinition 22 Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Let A be a Rlinear category with an anti-involution \u2217. Then cell datum for A consists of a\npartially ordered set \u039b, a finite set M(n, \u03bb) for each \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and each object n\nof A, and for \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and n,m any two objects of A we have an inclusion\nC : M(n, \u03bb) \u00d7 M(m, \u03bb) \u2192 HomA (n, m)\n\u03bb\nC : (S, T ) 7\u2192 CS,T\n\nThe conditions that this datum is required to satisfy are:\nC-1 For all objects n and m, the image of the map\nC:\n\na\n\nM(n, \u03bb) \u00d7 M(m, \u03bb) \u2192 HomA (n, m)\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nis a basis for HomA (n, m) as an R-module.\nC-2 For all objects n, m, all \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and all S \u2208 M(n, \u03bb), T \u2208 M(m, \u03bb) we\nhave\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2217\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nCS,T\n= CT,S\n25\n\n\fC-3 For all objects p, n, m, all \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and all a \u2208 HomA (p, n), S \u2208 M(n, \u03bb),\nT \u2208 M(m, \u03bb) we have\naC \u03bb (S, T ) =\n\nX\n\nra (S \u2032 , S)CS\u03bb\u2032,T\n\nmod A(< \u03bb)\n\nS \u2032 \u2208M (p,\u03bb)\n\nwhere ra (S \u2032 , S) \u2208 R is independent of T and A(< \u03bb) is the R-linear span\nof\no\nn\n\u03bc\n|\u03bc < \u03bb; S \u2208 M(p, \u03bc), T \u2208 M(m, \u03bc)\nCS,T\n\nAnother way of formulating C-3 is that for all objects p, n, m, all \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and\nall S \u2208 M(p, \u03bb),T \u2208 M(n, \u03bb), U \u2208 M(n, \u03bb),V \u2208 M(m, \u03bb) we have\n\u03bb\nC \u03bb (S, T )C \u03bb (U, V ) = hT, UiCS,V\n\nmod A(< \u03bb)\n\nwhere hT, Ui is independent of S and V .\nA consequence of this definition is that for all \u03bb \u2208 \u039b we have ideals A(< \u03bb) and\nA(\u2264 \u03bb) where for all objects n, m the subspace A(< \u03bb)(n, m) is the R-linear\nspan of\no\nn\n\u03bc\n|\u03bc < \u03bb; S \u2208 M(n, \u03bc), T \u2208 M(m, \u03bc)\nCS,T\nand the subspace A(\u2264 \u03bb)(n, m) is the R-linear span of\nn\n\n\u03bc\nCS,T\n|\u03bc \u2264 \u03bb; S \u2208 M(n, \u03bc), T \u2208 M(m, \u03bc)\n\no\n\nThis is a generalisation of the definition of a cellular algebra since we can\nregard any algebra over R as an R-linear category with one object.\nMore significantly, if A is a cellular category then End(n) is a cellular algebra\nfor any object n of A.\nA functor \u03c6 : A \u2192 A\u2032 between cellular categories is cellular if we have a map\nof partially ordered sets \u03c6 : \u039b \u2192 \u039b\u2032 and set maps\n\u03c6\u03bb : M(n, \u03bb) \u2192 M \u2032 (\u03c6(n), \u03c6(\u03bb))\nsuch that\n\n\u03c6(\u03bb)\n\n\u03bb\n\u03c6(CS,T\n) = C\u03c6\u03bb (S),\u03c6\u03bb (T )\n\nmod A\u2032(< \u03c6(\u03bb))\n\nfor all \u03bb and all S, T .\nOne reason for considering cellular categories instead of just the cellular endomorphism algebras is that for each object n and each \u03bb \u2208 \u039b we have an\nR-linear functor \u03c1(n; \u03bb) from A to the category of left EndA (n)-modules which\non objects is given by\n\u03c1(n; \u03bb) : m 7\u2192 HomA(\u03bb) (n, m)\n26\n\n\fFurthermore if \u03bc < \u03bb then we have a natural transformation from \u03c1(n; \u03bc) to\n\u03c1(n; \u03bb). This is used in Graham and Lehrer (1998).\nProposition 23 The category D with the \u2217-functor given by the pivotal structure is cellular.\nPROOF. The partially ordered set \u039b is the set of dominant weights. For\nn an object of D and \u03bb a dominant weight we take the set M(n, \u03bb) to be\ne We require that each diagram in\na set of diagrams (or morphisms in D).\nM(n, \u03bb) has n boundary points on the top edge and that the bottom edge\nis a minimal cut path of weight \u03bb (see Definition 3). Furthermore we require\nthat the bottom edge is minimal with these properties. This means that each\ndiagram D \u2208 M(n, \u03bb) has the property that if D = D1 D2 is a factorisation in\ne such that the bottom edge of D has weight \u03bb then D = D .\nD\n1\n1\n\nNext we construct the map C. Let D \u2032 \u2208 M(n, \u03bb) and D \u2208 M(m, \u03bb). Then we\ne D \u2032 HD \u2217 where the diagram H is\ndefine C(D \u2032 , D) to be the composition in D,\nuniquely determined by the properties that this composition exists and gives\nan irreducible diagram such that every cut path that traverses the rectangle\nhas weight at least \u03bb.\n\nThis gives the data in Definition 22. Next we verify that the conditions are satisfied. Each irreducible (n, m)-diagram can be written uniquely as C(D \u2032 , D) =\nD \u2032 HD \u2217 . The weight \u03bb is the minimum weight of a cut path which traverses the\nrectangle. This shows that the diagram has a factorisation as D \u2032 D \u2217 where the\nbottom edges of D and D \u2032 are minimal cut paths of weight \u03bb. Then to obtain\nthe factorisation as C(D \u2032 , D) = D \u2032 HD \u2217 apply the analogue of (Kuperberg,\n1996, Lemma 6.6) to both the top and bottom edge of the rectangle.\nIt has been shown in \u00a75 that the set of irreducible (n, m)-diagrams is a basis\nof HomD (n, m) and hence property C-1 holds.\nThe property C-2 holds by construction since\nC(D, D \u2032)\u2217 = (D \u2032 HD \u2217 )\u2217 = DH \u2217 (D \u2032 )\u2217 = C(D \u2032 , D)\nThe property C-3 holds by inspecting the relations for D.\nCorollary 24 For n > 0 the algebra AP (n) \u223c\n= AD (n) is cellular over Z[\u03b4].\nLet k be a field and \u03c6 : Z[\u03b4] \u2192 k a ring homomorphism. Then by applying the\nfunctor \u2212 \u2297Z[\u03b4] k to the algebra AP (n) \u223c\n= AD (n) we obtain a k-algebra which\nwe denote by A(n)\u03c6 . In the rest of this section we will write [r] for \u03c6([r]) \u2208 k.\nThe definition of a quasi-hereditary algebra is given in Cline et al. (1988) and\ncellular algebras over a field which are quasi-hereditary are characterised in\n27\n\n\fK\u00f6nig and Xi (1999).\nProposition 25 If \u03b4(\u03b4 2 \u2212 2)(\u03b4 2 \u2212 3)(\u03b4 4 \u2212 5\u03b4 2 + 5) 6= 0 then A(n)\u03c6 has the\nfollowing properties\n(1) The algebra A(n)\u03c6 is quasi-hereditary.\n(2) The algebra A(n)\u03c6 has finite global dimension.\n(3) The Cartan matrix of A(n)\u03c6 has determinant one.\nPROOF. We apply (K\u00f6nig and Xi, 1999, Lemma 2.1 (3)) to show that the algebra A(n)\u03c6 is quasi-hereditary. The result is then an application of (K\u00f6nig and Xi,\n1999, Theorem 3.1).\nLet 0 = J0 \u2282 J1 \u2282 . . . \u2282 JN = A(n)\u03c6 be a cell chain of ideals. Then we\nshow that for 1 \u2264 r \u2264 N that there is an idempotent e such that e \u2208 Jr and\ne\u2208\n/ Jr\u22121 . It follows that Jr2 * Jr\u22121 .\nFor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 we have orthogonal idempotents\n1\n[3]\n1\n1\n1\n[4][5]\nU\n,\nK\n,\n+\nH\n+\nK\n\u2212\nUi\ni\ni\ni\ni\n[2]2\n[2]2 [6]\n[2]2 [2]2\n[2]3\n[2]3 [10]\nwhich we denote by ui ,ki and ei . Then for each dominant weight (a, b, c) such\nthat 2a + 2b + 2c \u2264 n we have an idempotent\n(u1 u3 . . . u2a\u22121 )(k2a+1 k2a+3 . . . k2a+2b\u22121 )(e2a+2b+1 e2a+2b+3 . . . e2a+2b+2c\u22121 )\n\nReferences\nCline, E., Parshall, B., Scott, L., 1988.
