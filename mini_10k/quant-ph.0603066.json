This protocol comprises\nof BB84 protocol and SARG protocol, especially in aspects of controlling classical sifting procedures\nof two protocols. The protocol is more secure than both of BB84 protocol and SARG protocol, and\nthe ultimate limit of robustness in the proposed protocol expands as well than both of them.\nPACS numbers: Valid PACS appear here\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol is the only\nphysically secure method for the distribution of a secret\nkey between two distant partners (called Alice and Bob).\nThe physical secure comes from the well-known facts that\nan attacker (called Eve) cannot measure an unknown\nquantum state without modifies the state itself, and she\ncannot duplicate the state and forward a perfect copy to\nBob. The facts are proved by two principles, \"Uncertainty principle\" and \"No cloning theorem\". BB84 protocol [2] is the first single-photon QKD protocols, which\nuse a random string of signal states which, for example,\ncan be realized as single photons in horizontal, vertical,\nright circular or left circular polarization states.\nIn recent years, several long-distance implementations\nof BB84 protocol have been developed, that use photons as information carriers and optical fibers as quantum\nchannels. Most often Alice sends to Bob a coherent weak\nlaser pulse in which she has encoded the bit. In weak\npulses QKD system, there are the pulses which contains\nmore than one photon with non-negligible probability. It\nimplies that for these pulses Eve no longer limited by\n\"No cloning theorem\", and she can perform new types\nof attacks to obtain the secret key without introducing\nerrors. In such the attacks, there are Photon Number\nSplitting (PNS) attacks [1][3][5]. Although PNS attacks\nare far beyond today's technology, if one includes them in\nthe security analysis, the consequences are dramatic and\nlong-distance weak laser pulse QKD systems no longer\nhave physical security.\nIn this paper, we propose a new QKD protocol robust\nagainst PNS attacks, achieved by alternative of BB84\nprotocol and SARG protocol [5]. The protocol is more\nsecure than both of BB84 protocol and SARG protocol,\nespecially long-distance weak laser pulses QKD systems.\nThe advantage of this protocol is that it is easy to implement, just because it is composed of an existing quantum\nkey distribution system, where the classical sifting procedure is only changed which is easier than making a\nperfect single-photon source.\n\nII.\n\nPROPOSED PROTOCOL\n\nOur protocol uses four quantum states\nQ := {| + xi, | \u2212 xi, | + zi, | \u2212 zi}\n\u221a\nsuch that |h\u03c9x|\u03c9 \u2032 zi| = 1/ 2 with \u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 \u2208 {+, \u2212} and\n|h+\u03b1| \u2212 \u03b1i| = 0 with \u03b1 \u2208 {x, z}. The four states are also\nused by BB84 protocol and SARG protocol. | \u00b1 xi and\n|\u00b1zi denote the eigenvectors of \u03c3x and \u03c3z with eigenvalue\n\u00b11, respectively.\nOur protocol contains following phases;\n1 Quantum communication phase\nAlice selects randomly one of four states |Ai \u2208 Q\nand sends |Ai to Bob. Bob measures either \u03c3x or\n\u03c3z , and gets a state |Bi \u2208 Q. We call |Ai and |Bi\nraw keys.\n2 Selecting annoucement phase\nAlice performs a procedure, in which she obtains 0\nwith the probability a, and 1 with the probability\n1 \u2212 a, and she gets A \u2208 {0, 1}. The probability a\nis determined uniquely by the length of fiber and\n0 \u2264 a \u2264 1. If A = 0, go to step 3-1 and 4-1, and\notherwise, go to step 3-2 and 4-2.\n3-1 Classical announcement phase (for A = 0)\nAlice announces publicly a pair of two states A =\n{|A1 i, |A2 i}, such that |Ai \u2208 A and |hA1 |A2 i| = 0.\nIt means that Alice announces a pair of orthogonal\nstates.\n4-1 Sifting and decoding phase (for A = 0)\nWhen |Bi \u2208 A, they get bits, called sifted keys,\nfrom |Ai and |Bi with the convention that | + xi\nand | + zi code for 0 and | \u2212 xi and | \u2212 zi code for\n1.\nWhen |Bi \u2208\n/ A, they discard their raw keys.\n3-2 Classical announcement phase (for A = 1)\nAlice selects randomly one of two pairs of states\nA = {|A1 i, |A2 i}, such that |Ai \u2208 A and\n\n\f2\n\u221a\n|hA1 |A2 i| = 1/ 2, and announces publicly A to\nBob. It means that Alice announces a pair of\nnonorthogonal states.\n4-2 Sifting and decoding phase (for A = 1)\nWhen |Bi \u2208\n/ A, Bob obtains |B \u2032\u221a\ni from |Bi, such\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthat |B i \u2208 A and |hB|B i| = 1/ 2, and they get\nsifted keys from |Ai and |B \u2032 i with the convention\nthat | \u00b1 xi code for 0 and | \u00b1 zi code for 1.\nWhen |Bi \u2208 A, they discard their raw keys.\nRemark 1\nBB84 is described as the proposed protocol with a = 1,\nand SARG is same as this protocol with a = 0.\nIII.\n\nPHOTON NUMBER SPLITTING ATTACKS\n\nIn weak pulses QKD system, Alice sends to Bob a weak\nlaser pulse in which she has encoded the bit. Each pulse\nis a priori in a coherent state of weak intensity,\nP which can\nbe rewritten as a mixture of Fock states, n\u22650 pn |nihn|,\nwith the number n of photons distributed according to\nthe Poissonian statistics of mean \u03bc, pn = e\u03bc /n! [1][3][5].\nConsider now the implementation of the proposed protocol with weak pulses. Bob's detector is triggered with\nprobability, taking into account intensities of weak laser\npulses, channel losses and imperfect detection efficiencies. Then, in the absence of Eve, Bob's raw detection\nrate, which is the probability that he detects a photon\nper pulse sent by Alice, is given by\nX\nRraw (\u03b7\u03c1 ) =\npn {1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7d \u03b7\u03c1 )n } \u2243 \u03b7d \u03b7\u03c1 \u03bc\nn\u22651\n\nwhere \u03b7d is the quantum efficiency of a detector and \u03b7\u03c1\nis the channel transmission.\nIn this case, if we endow Eve with unlimited technological power within the laws of quantum physics, the\nfollowing attacks, named a storage attack and an Intercept Resend with Unambiguous Discrimination attack\n(shortly an IRUD attack ), are possible in principle [5].\n(We will explain details of these attacks later.) If Alice\nand Bob are connected by a lossy channel (\u03b7\u03c1 < 1) and\nEve has a lossless channel (\u03b7\u03c1 = 1) which connects Alice\nand Bob, Eve performs either attacks on a fraction q of\npulses, that is, she tries as follows:\n1. Eve performs a procedure, in which she obtains 0\nwith the probability q and 1 with the probability\n1 \u2212 q.\n2. When she gets 1, she only forwards the pulse to\nBob using her lossless channel. When she gets 0,\nshe performs one of the two PNS attacks.\nThe attack probability q depends on both a type of her\nattack and the length of lossy channel, such that Alice\nand Bob do not notice any change in the expected raw\nrate and Eve remains undetected.\n\nA.\n\nStorage Attack\n\nWe will explain the procedure of a storage attack [3]\nin the following.\n1. Eve counts the number of photons in the pulse, using photon number quantum nondemolition measurement. If the pulse contains only one photon,\nEve discards the photon.\n2. When Eve detects that it is a multiphoton pulse,\nshe keeps one of the photons in a quantum memory\nand forwards the remaining photons to Bob, using\na perfectly transparent quantum channel, \u03b7\u03c1 = 1.\n3. By the information in classical announcement\nphase, Eve correspondingly measures the photon\nstored in her quantum memory.\nWhen Eve applies a storage attack on a fraction q of\nthe pulses, Bob's raw detection rate is\nX\nRS (q) = (1 \u2212 q)\u03b7d \u03bc + q\npn {1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7d )n\u22121 }\nn\u22652\n\n\u2243 (1 \u2212 q)\u03b7d \u03bc + q\u03b7d p2 .\n\nBy Lemma 1, her mutual information of the key is\nS\nIPr\n(q) =\n\np\u03b7d p2\n* IS\n(1 \u2212 q)\u03b7d \u03bc + q\u03b7d p2 a\n\nwhere\nIaS\n\n= 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 a) * H\n\n!\n\u221a\n2+1\n\u221a\n2 2\n\nwith H(x) = \u2212x log2 x + (1 \u2212 x) log2 (1 \u2212 x).\nLemma 1 ([4])\nEve is now faced with the problem of detecting two states\n(|xi and |yi), having an overlap |hx|yi| = \u03c7. Then she applies the measurement maximizing her information, obtaining\nI(\u03c7) = 1 \u2212 H(P )\np\nwhere P = 12 (1 + 1 \u2212 \u03c72 ).\n\nGiven \u03b7\u03c1 , Eve chooses q such that Rraw (\u03b7\u03c1 ) = RS (q)\nand her mutual information of the sifted key is\n\u03bc\nS\nITr\n(\u03b7\u03c1 ) = (\u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1) * \u22121\n* IS.\np2 \u2212 1 a\nB.\n\nIntercept Resend with Unambiguous\nDiscrimination Attack\n\nAn encoded pulse containing three photons is rewritten\nas one of the four states\n{|\u03a81 i, |\u03a82 i, |\u03a83 i, |\u03a84 i}\n\b\n= | + xi\u22973 , | \u2212 xi\u22973 , | + zi\u22973 , | \u2212 zi\u22973 .\n\n\f3\nIn this case, there exist four orthogonal states of three\nqubits, |\u03a61 i, . . . , |\u03a64 i, such that h\u03a8i |\u03a6j i = \u03b4ij \u221a12 . Therefore, we can perform a measurement M, that distinguishes unambiguously among |\u03a81 i, . . . , |\u03a84 i, with a\nprobability of success pok = 1/2.\nWe will explain the procedure of an IRUD attack [5]\nin the following.\n1. Eve measures the number of photons and discards\na pulse containing less than three photons.\n2. On the pulse containing at least three photons, Eve\nperforms the measurement M.\n3. If the result is conclusive, she sends a new photon\nprepared in the good state to Bob using a perfectly\ntransparent quantum channel. If not conclusive,\nEve discards the result and the pulse.\nWhen Eve applies the IRUD attack on a fraction p of\nthe pulses, Bob's raw detection rate and Eve's mutual\ninformation are\nX\nRI (q) = (1 \u2212 q)\u03b7d \u03bc + qpok\npn {1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7d )n\u22122 }\nn\u22653\n\n\u2243 (1 \u2212 q)\u03b7d \u03bc + q\u03b7d pok p3\n\nand\nI\nIPr\n(q) \u2243\n\nq\u03b7d pok p3\n.\n(1 \u2212 q)\u03b7d \u03bc + q\u03b7d pok p3\n\nWhen Eve chooses q such that Rraw (\u03b7\u03c1 ) = RI (q), her\nmutual information of the sifted key is\nI\nITr\n(\u03b7\u03c1 ) = (\u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1) *\n\nIV.\n\n1\n\u22121\n\n(pok p3 )\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\nSECURITY AGAINST PNS ATTACKS\n\nIn this section, we evaluate security against PNS attacks with QBER = 0. In proposed protocol, the sifted\nkey rate, which is the probability that Alice and Bob\nshare a sifted key per a pulse, is given by\nRsift (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) \u2243\n\n1+a\n* \u03b7d \u03b7\u03c1 \u03bc.\n4\n\nIt is easy to see that security against PNS attacks will\nbe decreasing the sifted key rate. Therefore, we shall\nevaluate a security under the condition that a sifted key\nrate is constant regardless of the selecting probability a\n[5]. Then, we change \u03bc to\n\u03bca =\n\n2\n* \u03bcB\n1+a\n\nwhere \u03bcB is the mean photon number when using BB84\nprotocol. In this paper, we use a typical value \u03bcB = 0.1.\n\nEve's mutual information of the sifted key when she\nperforms either of two PNS attacks is resprctively\nI S (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) = (\u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1) *\n\n1\n2\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bca\n\n\u22121\n\n* IaS\n\nand\nI I (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) = (\u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1) *\n\n1\n12\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bca 2\n\n\u22121\n\nFrom these equations, we have the following theorem:\nTheorem 1\nConsider Alice and Bob share a secret key using weal\nlaser pulse QKD system and our proposed protocol. They\nchoose the selecting parameter a (0 \u2264 a \u2264 1) to minimize\nEve's mutual information of the shared key.\nWhen Eve performs only the storage attack, the best\nparamter is a = 0, that is, they use SARG protocol. On\nthe other hand, when Eve performs the IRUD attack, the\nbest is a = 1, that is, they use BB84 protocol.\nProof.\nWe will prove that the following equations:\n\u2202 S\nI (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) > 0\n\u2202a\n\u2202 I\nI (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) < 0.\n\u2202a\nWe can calculate that\n\u2202 S\n\u2202 IaS\nI (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) = (\u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1) *\n\u2202a\n\u2202a f (a)\n= (\u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1) *\n\n\u2202 S\n\u2202a Ia\n\n* f (a) \u2212 IaS *\n{f (a)}2\n\n\u2202\n\u2202a f (a)\n\nwhere f (a) = e\u2212\u03bc2a \u03bca \u2212 1.\nSuppose that\n\u2202\n\u2202 S\nI * f (a) \u2212 IaS *\nf (a)\n\u2202a a\n\u2202a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\nS\n= (1 \u2212 L ) \u2212\u03bca\n\u22121\n\u03bca\ne\n2\u03bca \u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bca )\n\u2212 (a + (1 \u2212 a)LS )\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bca 2\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\n\u2202\n\u221a\nand \u03bca \u2032 = \u2202a\nwhere LS = 1 \u2212 H 22+1\n\u03bca < 0.\n2\ng(a) =\n\nConsidering LS as variable, we can get\n\n\u2202\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bca 2 \u2212 2\u03bca + 2(1 \u2212 a)\u03bca \u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bca )\ng(a)\n=\n\u2202LS\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bca 2\n2\n2{\u03bca \u2212 \u03bca + (1 \u2212 a)\u03bca \u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bca )}\n<\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bc2a\n2\n2{\u03bca \u2212 \u03bca + (1 \u2212 \u03bca )}\n<\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bc2a\n2\u03bca (\u03bca \u2212 1)\n<\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bc2a\n\u22640\n\n\f4\nBy \u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1 \u2265 0, we have\nNext, suppose that\n\n\u2202 S\n\u2202a I (a, \u03b7\u03c1 )\n\n> 0.\n\n\u2202\nh(a)\n\u2202 I\nI (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) = (\u03b7\u03c1 \u22121 \u2212 1) * \u2212 \u2202a\n\u2202a\n{h(a)}2\n\nwhere h(a) =\nThen\n\nFIG. 1: Security against PNS attacks with QBER = 0.

We\nsay that, in the case of l \u2265 100km, the proposed protocol with a = 0.5 is better than SARG protocol because\nI I (0.5, \u03b7\u03c1 ) \u2264 I I (1, \u03b7\u03c1 ).\nSecond, consider that Alice and Bob choose a to minimize Eve's mutual information when she performs the\nmost convenient PNS attack, in which her mutual information is\nI P (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ) = max{I S (a, \u03b7\u03c1 ), I I (a, \u03b7\u03c1 )}.\n\nFIG. 2: Security against PNS attacks when Alice and Bob\nchoose an optimal a. If l \u2264 87.5km, they only use a = 0. If l >\n87.5km, they increase a shown in the dotted line. Comparing\nwith Figure 1, our protocol is more secure against PNS attacks\nthan both of two protocols.\n\nBy Figure 2, we can say that, by choosing an optimal a,\nthe ultimate limit of robustness is shifted from 100km,\nwhich is the ultimate limit of SARG protocol, to 125km,\nwhich is the longest record among experimental QKD\nsystems in the world.\n\nTherefore, because LS < 0.5, it can be shown that\ng(a) > g(a)|LS =0.5\n\u03bca (2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bca \u03bca ) \u2212 2(1 + a)\u03bca \u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bca )\n2e\u2212\u03bca \u03bca 2\n\u03bca (1 \u2212 \u03bca ) + (1 + a)\u03bca \u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bca )\n>\ne\u2212\u03bca \u03bca 2\n=0\n\n=\n\n2\u03bcB\nwhere (1 + a)\u03bca \u2032 = \u2212(1 + a) (1+a)\n2 = \u2212\u03bca .\n\n[1] A.
