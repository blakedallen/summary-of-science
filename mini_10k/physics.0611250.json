The crystals have uniform square cross-section, \u2248 30 \u03bcm on the side, and reach several\nmm in length.\nPACS numbers: 81.10.Bk\n\nFor many years, we have been using glass alkali-metal\nvapor cells with inner walls coated with paraffin. Highquality paraffin coatings [1, 2] have the \"magical\" property that polarized alkali atoms may bounce between the\ncell walls several thousand times before they depolarize,\nwhich has led to wide-spread application of such cells\nanywhere where long-lived atomic polarization is desired,\nfor example, in optical atomic magnetometers [3].\nWhile condensation of the alkali metal on the paraffin\ncoated walls is usually carefully avoided, and the excess\nmetal is located in the cell \"stem\" (see Fig. 1), in some\nof the cells, we have observed needle-like metal crystals\nshown on the insets of Fig. 1, that have \"grown\" from\nthe paraffin coating and have reached the length of up to\n2-3 mm in about a two-month's time since the cells were\nmade (our coating procedure is described in Ref. [4]).\nThe crystals are all of regular square cross-section, \u2248\n30 \u03bcm on the side, terminating on a sharp-vertex pyramid\nat the ends of the needle.\nThe observed rate of growth indicates that an atom\nfrom the vapor phase that hits the crystal at the prismatic part of the needle near the vertex has sticking\nprobability of order unity, or that atoms adsorbed in a\n\"wrong\" place on the crystal somehow migrate towards\nthe end of the needle.\nWhile most of the whiskers are perpendicular to the\ncell wall, occasionally, we find needles that grow at an\nangle.\nA quick e-mail poll of the workers who have studied\nparaffin coated cells has revealed that, while most of them\nhave not seen alkali-metal whiskers, the paraffin-coating\npioneer, Hugh Robinson (now at NIST, Boulder), has, in\nfact, first observed their formation some 20 years ago, and\nwas even able to stimulate their formation by providing\na \"cold spot\" on the surface of the cell. Unfortunately,\nRobinson's results remain unpublished.\nAs it turns out, rubidium is a member of a large \"family\" of metals and other materials that tend to grow\nwhiskers [5]. In fact, tin, zinc, and gold whiskers represent a significant problem for electronics industry, as\n\nthey can lead to electrical shorts and failure of electronic\nequipment. NASA maintains an informative web site [6]\ndevoted to metal whiskers, however, alkali metals have\nnot as yet been featured. There are also reports of bismuth whiskers growing in a heat-pipe vapor cell [7].\n\n30 \u021d\nm\n\nb\n\nc\n\na\n\nFIG. 1: a. The view of a paraffin coated vapor cell with one\nof the rubidium whiskers clearly seen (outlined with a yellow\ncircle). b. A microscope photograph of the side view of the\nwhisker. c. Microscope photograph of the base of the whisker\nas seen from the coating side.\n\nAlkali-metal needles may also present certain problems, for example, in the work that requires application\nof high-voltage electric field to coated cells [8]. On the\nother hand, they might also prove useful as a way to\nmanufacture alkali-metal wires, for which one interesting\napplication is loading a dense cryogenic buffer gas with\nthe alkali metal by laser ablation from of the end of a\nmicron-sized wires [9].\nWe are grateful to W.
