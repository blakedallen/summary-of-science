INTRODUCTION\n\nSeveral soft X-ray transients, identified in outburst\nto be accreting neutron star (NS) systems, have\nbeen observed in quiescence (see Campana et al. 1998;\nRutledge et al. 2002b). These systems show soft spectra,\ngenerally consisting of a thermal, blackbody-like component, and in most cases a harder component extending to higher energies, usually fit with a power-law of\nphoton index 1-2. The nature of their X-ray emission\nremains unsolved. Brown et al. (1998, see also Campana et al. 1998) advanced the idea that the soft thermal component seen in these systems can be explained\nby the release, over long timescales, of heat injected\ninto the deep crust by pycnonuclear reactions driven\nduring accretion (the \"deep crustal heating\" model).\nThis scenario accurately predicts the quiescent luminosity of some qLMXBs, based on their outburst history\n(Rutledge et al. 2000, 2001a), and must operate at some\nlevel. (Recent observations of low quiescent luminosities in some qLMXBs (Colpi et al. 2001; Campana et al.\n2002; Yakovlev et al. 2003; Wijnands 2004) may require\nnonstandard cooling processes.)\nHowever, the deep crustal heating model cannot explain the hard power-law component, which is attributed\nto continued accretion and/or a shock from a pulsar wind\n(see Campana et al. 1998; Menou & McClintock 2001).\n1 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden\nStreet, Cambridge, MA 02138;\ncheinke@cfa.harvard.edu,\njosh@cfa.harvard.edu,\npedmonds@cfa.harvard.edu\n2 Northwestern University, Dept. of Physics & Astronomy, 2145\nSheridan Rd., Evanston, IL 60208\n3 Lindheimer Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nContinued accretion has also been suggested as an explanation for the thermal component, as the radiation\nspectrum from matter accreting radially onto a neutron star should be similar to that from the ionized hydrogen atmosphere of a hot non-accreting neutron star\n(Zampieri et al. 1995). Models without any continuing\naccretion have difficulty explaining the short-timescale\n(\u223c 104 s) variability observed from Aquila X-1 and Cen\nX-4 (Rutledge et al. 2002b; Campana et al. 2004), and\nthe days-timescale variability observed from Cen X-4\n(Campana et al. 1997) and other qLMXBs. However,\nmany qLMXBs in globular clusters show neither significant variability nor an additional power-law spectral\ncomponent (Heinke et al. 2003a, hereafter HGL03). Understanding the emission process will be critical for modeling the observed spectrum and deriving fundamental\nphysical parameters, such as mass, radius, and magnetic\nfield (Lattimer & Prakash 2004; Brown et al. 1998).\nGlobular clusters are overabundant in accreting NS\nsystems compared to the field, with thirty-eight probable\nqLMXBs and active LMXBs known so far (Heinke et al.\n2003b). The well-studied globular cluster 47 Tucanae\n(NGC 104; hereafter 47 Tuc) is ideal for X-ray studies of\nits binary populations (Grindlay et al. 2001a) due to its\nclose distance (4.85\u00b10.18 kpc, Gratton et al. 2003) and\nlow reddening (E(B \u2212V ) = 0.024\u00b10.004, Gratton et al.\n2003). Two qLMXBs in 47 Tuc, X5 and X7 (originally\ndetected by ROSAT, Verbunt & Hasinger 1998), have\nbeen spectrally identified by HGL03. HGL03 constrained\nthe range of mass and radius space for X7 using several\ndifferent possible assumptions about its spectrum, and\nshowed that X5 is an eclipsing system with an 8.67 hour\nperiod and strong dipping activity.\n\n\f2\n\nHeinke et al.\n\nWe have shown (HGL03, Heinke et al. 2003b) that\nthe identified qLMXBs in 47 Tuc, and in globular clusters generally, have little to no hard power-law component in contrast to the best-studied field systems,\nCen X-4 and Aql X-1 (Rutledge et al. 2001a, 2002b).\nThe exceptions thus far have been the transient LMXB\nin NGC 6440, which entered outburst 13 months after the Chandra observation (in't Zand et al. 2001),\nand the transient LMXB in Terzan 5 (Wijnands et al.\n2003), both relatively bright qLMXBs. If the strength\nof the power-law component (and short-term variability)\nmeasures continuing low-level accretion (Campana et al.\n1998; Rutledge et al. 2002a), then the absence of these\nindicators in globular cluster systems might be taken\nto indicate extremely low levels of accretion activity.\nRecently, Jonker et al. (2004a) noted that the relative\nstrength of the spectral component fit with power-laws\nin quiescent NS transients seems to increase for X-ray luminosities significantly larger or smaller than LX \u223c 1033\nergs s\u22121 , where its relative strength is often at a minimum (but cf. Wijnands et al. 2003). They suggested\nthat this spectral component arises from different processes (accretion vs. pulsar wind shock?) in systems with\nX-ray luminosities above or below 1033 ergs s\u22121 .\nIn late 2002, we obtained deeper Chandra observations\nof 47 Tuc (Heinke et al. 2004), allowing detailed spectral\nmodeling of X-ray sources as faint as LX \u223c 1031 ergs s\u22121 .\nMost sources were found to be consistent with powerlaw\nor thermal plasma models, but some sources required\nmore complicated models. The highly variable X-ray\nsource W37 (=CXOGLB J002404.9-720451) showed a\nsteep spectrum well-described by a blackbody, and the Xray sources W17 (=CXOGLB J002408.3-720431) and X4\n(=W125, or CXOGLB J002353.9-720350) showed twocomponent spectra in which the soft component could\nbe well-represented by a model of a hydrogen atmosphere appropriate for a neutron star. X4 was first identified in ROSAT HRI data (Verbunt & Hasinger 1998),\nwhile W17 and W37 are located in areas too crowded to\nhave been identified in lower-resolution ROSAT data at\ntheir current fluxes. None of these three have been positively identified with optical counterparts of any category\n(Edmonds et al. 2003a,b). In this paper, we study these\nthree strong qLMXB candidates in detail. We describe\nthe observations and our reduction in \u00a7 2, the timing\nanalysis in \u00a7 2.1, and the spectral analyses in \u00a7 2.2. Discussion and conclusions are in \u00a7 3.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe data used in this paper are from the 2000 and\n2002 Chandra observations of the globular cluster 47 Tuc.\nBoth sets of observations and their initial reduction are\ndescribed in detail in Heinke et al. (2004); prior analyses of the 2000 dataset are described in Grindlay et al.\n(2001a, 2002) and HGL03. Both observations interleaved\nshort exposures using subarrays (chosen to reduce pileup,\nwhich is not a significant issue for the three sources in\nthis paper) with longer exposures. The observations are\nsummarized in Table 1; we note that OBS ID 3385 suffered strongly increased background, so we do not use\nthat short observation. We reprocessed (using CIAO 3.0)\nboth the 2000 and 2002 observations to remove the 0.\u2032\u2032 25\npixel randomization added in standard processing, implement the CTI correction algorithm on the 2000 data,\n\nand use updated (Feb. 2004, CALDB v. 2.26) calibration files. We did not remove events flagged as cosmic-ray\nafterglows by the standard processing. 290 sources were\ndetected using the WAVDETECT routine in the 0.3-6\nand 0.3-2 keV energy bands, and ten additional sources\n(missed by WAVDETECT due to crowding) were added\nto the source list by hand.\nWe used the ACIS EXTRACT routine (Broos et al.\n2002) from the Tools for X-ray Analysis (TARA4 ) to\nconstruct polygonal extraction regions generally chosen\nto match the 90% encircled energy (at 1.5 keV) from\nthe Chandra point-spread function (PSF). We extracted\nsource spectra and background spectra from nearby\nsource-free regions, and corrected the ancillary response\nfunction (ARF) for the energy-varying fraction of the\nPSF enclosed by the extraction region. We used the\nJan. 2004 release of the ACIS contamination model to\ncorrect for the hydrocarbon buildup on the detectors\n(Marshall et al. 2004). We adjusted all event times to\nthe solar system barycenter using satellite orbit files provided by the Chandra X-ray Center.\n2.1. Timing Analysis\nKolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests on the 2002 event arrival times from W37 and X4 confirm that both are\nclearly variable on short timescales, with KS probabilities of constancy reaching 10\u221247 and 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 for the\nfirst 2002 observations of W37 and X4 respectively. W17\nshows only marginal evidence for variability, with KS\nprobabilities reaching only 0.04. X4 falls on a chip gap\nin the 2000 data, and W37 is much fainter in the 2000\ndata. W37 receives a photon flux over five times higher in\nthe first 2002 observation than in any other observation,\nand 75% of the 2002 photons from W37 arrive in the first\nquarter of the data. X4 appears to have dimmed slightly\nbetween the first and fourth long 2002 observations (at\n99% conf.).\nWe show the first (and most variable) sections of the\n2002 lightcurves for W37 and X4 in Figures 1 and 2.\nGenerating a power spectrum for W37 (using XRONOS,\n5\n) gives a possible peak around 11000 seconds along with\nstrong red noise. An epoch folding search using all the\n2002 observations finds a periodicity at 11112.5 (\u00b115)\nseconds. Careful inspection of W37's lightcurves reveals\nlikely eclipses, indicated in Figures 1 and 3 (left; a folded\nlightcurve), consistent with the 11112.5 second period.\nThe two clearest eclipses are separated by 6.2 hours, so\nwe also include a lightcurve folded on twice our preferred period (Figure 3, right), showing two apparent\neclipses. This indicates that our preferred period is probably correct, but the low count rate of the data may allow\nfor alternative solutions. The folded lightcurve suggests\neclipses 550 \u00b1 200 seconds in length.\nWe note that W37's lightcurve is similar to that of\nX5, presented in HGL03 and Heinke et al. (2005, in\nprep), suggesting that the strong variability seen in W37\nis also probably due to a varying column of cold gas\nassociated with an accretion disk viewed nearly edgeon. However, W37 may show residual emission during eclipses, which is not seen for X5 (HGL03). The\nperiod indicates a companion mass of order 0.34 M\u2299 ,\n4\n5\n\nhttp://www.astro.psu.edu/xray/docs/TARA/\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xronos/xronos.html\n\n\fNew Quiescent LMXBs in 47 Tuc\nif the companion has a density appropriate for lower\nmain sequence stars (Frank et al. 1992, eq. 4.9). Since\nthese companions are sometimes bloated (King & Ritter\n1999; Podsiadlowski et al. 2002; Orosz & van Kerkwijk\n2003; Kaluzny & Thompson 2003), the true mass may\nbe smaller. Assuming a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star, the orbital\nseparation would be \u223c 9 \u00d7 1010 cm.\nWe calculate the hardness ratio for W37 as the ratio of\nthe counts detected in the 1-6 keV and 0.3-1 keV bands\n(this choice divides the detected counts roughly evenly),\nand plot this ratio in the lower panel of Figure 1. Comparison with the upper panel shows that decreases in the\nobserved flux correlate well with increasing hardness. We\nconfirm this with a Spearman rank-order correlation test\n(Press et al. 1992) comparing the binned (1200 second)\nlightcurve with the similarly binned hardness ratio. This\ngives rs =-0.446, a negative correlation, with chance probability 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 . This is a strong sign that the variation is due to changing photoelectric absorption. We\ndivide W37's long 2002 observations into high and low\nflux states (e.g., the high flux state portions indicated in\nFigure 1), which we use to extract spectra.\nX4's total and hardness ratio lightcurve for OBS IDs\n2735 and 3384 are shown in Figure 2. No periodicities\nare apparent in X4's lightcurve or power spectra. X4's\nspectrum appears to harden as it brightens, in contrast\nto W37, which indicates the variability is not due to increasing photoelectric absorption. We confirm this with\na Spearman rank-order correlation test on OBS ID 2735,\nfinding rs =0.444 and chance probability 6.0\u00d710\u22124 for the\nbinned (1200 second) lightcurve and hardness ratio. We\nextract high and low portions of X4's lightcurve from the\nfirst observation for spectral fitting, which are marked in\nFigure 2.\n2.2. Spectral Analysis\n\nIn Heinke et al. (2004), we identify W37, X4, and W17\nas possible qLMXBs by their agreement with models consisting of a hydrogen-atmosphere model and a power-law,\nalong with their failure to fit single-component models typical of thermal plasma (such as seen in cataclysmic variables and X-ray active binaries). Here, we\nanalyze time-resolved spectra for W37 and X4, and use\nthe merged spectra (2000 and 2002) for W17 (since it\nshows no variability). We use the XSPEC phabs model\nto describe neutral absorbing gas. We use the Lloyd\n(2003) model to describe thermal blackbody-like emission from the hydrogen atmosphere of a neutron star,\nfixing the redshift to 0.306 (appropriate for a 1.4 M\u2299 , 10\nkm neutron star) and take the distance to be 4.85 kpc\n(Gratton et al. 2003). The total number of counts in the\n2002 spectra of W37, W17 and X4 were 1277, 909, and\n1426, while from the 2000 data 46, 114, and 62 counts\nwere available. We binned spectra with more than 1000\ncounts with 40 counts/bin, spectra from the 2000 observations or with fewer than 50 counts at 10 counts/bin,\nand other spectra at 20 counts/bin.\n2.2.1. W17\n\nW17 shows no variability on short or long timescales,\nso we fit the combined 2002 and combined 2000 datasets\nsimultaneously. We try a variety of absorbed singlecomponent models including blackbody, bremsstrahlung,\nMEKAL, power-law, and hydrogen atmosphere neutron\n\n3\n\nstar models, but do not find good fits with any. The\nbest fit of these, a power-law model, gives \u03c72\u03bd = 1.36, for\na 2% null hypothesis probability (nhp). Models consisting of two mekal components also do not produce good\nfits. Adding a soft component, such as the hydrogenatmosphere neutron star model of Lloyd (2003), to the\npower-law model improves the statistics tremendously\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 1.05, nhp=37%; F-test gives probability of 9\u00d710\u22125\nthat the extra component is not needed). The inferred\nradius of the neutron star model, R = 11.8+9.7\n\u22123.9 km, is\nperfectly consistent with the canonical 1.4 M\u2299 , 10 km\nneutron star predictions, although it cannot usefully constrain the neutron star structure. (The inferred radius\nfor a blackbody would be only 1.2+0.1\n\u22120.4 km.) A qLMXB\nmodel is thus an excellent explanation for this spectrum,\nshown in Figure 4. The parameters for a fit with a\nLloyd H-atmosphere model and power-law are listed in\nTable 2. The power-law component provides a majority\n(65+28\n\u221222 %) of the 0.5-10 keV flux, and the thermal component is quite weak, with unabsorbed X-ray luminosity\nLX (0.5 \u2212 2.5) = 1.7 \u00d7 1031 ergs s\u22121 and inferred bolometric luminosity Lbol = 6.7 \u00d7 1031 ergs s\u22121 .\n2.2.2. W37\n\nWe identify pieces of W37's lightcurves at high and low\nflux levels in the four long observations, with only a low\nflux level in the second long observation; the (barycentered) times are listed in Table 3. We extracted spectra\nfrom these periods, as well as from the summed 2000\nobservations, and background spectra from surrounding source-free regions, producing eight spectra of varied\nquality.\nThe hardening of the spectrum with decreasing flux\nsuggests that variation of the column density is responsible for the spectral variations, and so we allow the gas column to vary between spectral segments. However, no absorbed single-component model was able to describe the\neight spectra simultaneously by only varying the absorption and one other model parameter. (Allowing all the\nparameters to vary freely allows some reasonable fits, but\nloses physical meaning. For instance, a blackbody with\nstrongly varying normalization, temperature and absorbing column, while a reasonable fit, is difficult to interpret.) No single- or double-temperature thermal plasma\nmodel (represented by VMEKAL models in XSPEC, set\nto cluster abundances) provides a good fit to the brightest portions of the data. The brightest portions of the\ndata are best fit by a blackbody or hydrogen atmosphere\nneutron star model with varying absorption. If described\nby a blackbody, the inferred radius is only 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 km\nin size. This component is well-described by a hydrogenatmosphere neutron star model with a constant physical\nradius of order 10 km (12.3+5.8\n\u22123.5 km) and constant tem+10\nperature (82\u22129 eV). Therefore we infer that W37 is a\nqLMXB containing a neutron star.\nThe fainter portions show additional soft flux beyond\nwhat can be accounted for by an absorbed H-atmosphere\n(or blackbody) component. This suggests a second component that does not suffer the same absorption as the\nprimary spectral component. We model this component\nwith a separately absorbed power-law, although a variety of models can account for this low-count component\nequally well (including a 0.6 keV bremsstrahlung spec-\n\n\f4\n\nHeinke et al.\n\ntrum, a 0.1 keV blackbody with inferred 1 km radius,\nor a 0.13 keV thermal plasma model), and we do not\nknow its physical origin. We hold the faint component,\nits absorption, and the H-atmosphere model parameters\nfixed between data portions, and vary only the absorption to the H-atmosphere model. This is the XSPEC\nmodel PHABS ( POW + PHABS * HATM ), varying\nonly the second PHABS component between observations. We find a good fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.24 for 57 degrees of\nfreedom, or dof, and an nhp of 10.6%). We are unable to\nimpose serious constraints upon this model if additional\nparameters are allowed to vary, since the faint portions\nof the data have very few counts. Therefore we cannot\nusefully constrain any temporal or spectral variability in\nthe faint component. We show part of this fit (only 4\nof 8 spectra to reduce confusion) in Figure 5, and give\ndetails of the fit in Tables 2 and 3. The fitted absorption\ncolumn to the probable neutron star varies by a factor\n> 100, decreasing to a value consistent with the cluster\ncolumn during parts of the first 2002 observation. The\nfaint component is responsible for a very small portion\n(2+17\n\u22121 %) of the unabsorbed flux, and produces a photon\nindex of 3+5\n\u22121 . The absorption column to the faint com20\nponent is poorly constrained (NH = 4.5+84\n\u22124.5 \u00d7 10 ) but\nconsistent with the column to the cluster. The lowestflux spectrum (from OBS ID 2736), dominated by the\nfaint component, is one of the spectra shown in Figure 5.\n2.2.3. X4\n\nX4 varies during the first 2002 observation, but is not\nclearly variable within other observations. We separately\nfit the high-flux and low-flux parts of the first 2002 observation (OBS ID 2735), and data from each of the other\nthree long 2002 observations, plus one spectrum from\nthe combined 2000 observations. We found that the remaining 2002 observations were spectrally indistinguishable, so we combined all 2002 data except OBS ID 2735\ninto one spectrum, and fit the high and low-flux parts\nof 2735, the rest of the 2002 data, and the combined\n2000 data simultaneously. Fits with any single absorbed\ncomponent, with all parameters allowed to vary, failed\nto give reasonable fits to the spectra. A power-law fit\ngave the lowest \u03c72\u03bd = 1.45, nhp=3.9%, if NH is allowed\nto vary substantially along with the power-law parameters. However, if NH is not allowed to vary during the\n2002 data (as indicated in \u00a7 2.1 above), then \u03c72\u03bd =1.52,\nnhp=1.9%. Adding a H-atmosphere model improves the\nfit substantially (F-statistic=4.38, prob. 1.9% extra component not required), and results in an inferred radius\nconsistent with the 10 km canonical NS radius. We conclude that X4 is a good candidate for a qLMXB. Alternate models involving two VMEKAL components with\nall temperatures and normalizations free do not produce\ngood fits.\nThe variability during OBS ID 2735 demands that at\nleast one component of the spectrum varies. Varying\nNH alone does not produce a good fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 2.41,\nnhp=1\u00d710\u22124%). Varying the power-law component does\nproduce a good fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.30, nhp=11%; see Table 2).\nWe show this fit for the two components of OBS ID\n2735 (Fig. 6) and for the remainder of the 2002 observations, indicating the contributions of the two components (Fig. 7). Varying only the H-atmosphere com-\n\nponent's temperature and radius also produces a good\nfit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.35, nhp=7.3%; see Table 2). Varying both\nthe power-law and H-atmosphere parameters (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.21,\nnhp=20%) is only a marginal improvement over varying\na single component, and requires correlated swings in numerous parameters (which we assume is less likely than\none or two varying parameters). Varying only the powerlaw normalization also produces a good fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.33,\nnhp=7.5%), with a power-law photon index of 2.2+0.3\n\u22120.3 .\nVarying the H-atmosphere temperature alone does not\nproduce a good fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.62, nhp=0.7%), nor does\nvarying the normalization (and inferred radius) alone\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 1.85, nhp=0.07%). If the thermal component\nis due to continued accretion, and the variation is due\nto changes in the accretion rate onto the neutron star,\nwe would expect only the temperature to vary, not the\ninferred radius. It is possible that the emitting area\nvaries if accretion is ongoing, but variation in the emitting area has not been clearly seen in field qLMXBs with\nhigher statistics (Rutledge et al. 2002b; Campana et al.\n2004). Therefore we conclude that the power-law probably varies, and that we do not have strong evidence for\nvariability of the thermal component in this source.\nWe can also compare X4's flux in our Chandra observations to its flux in ROSAT HRI observations from\n1992-1996 (which contain very little spectral information). Verbunt & Hasinger (1998) report 49\u00b19 counts\nfrom X4 (which we confidently identify with our source)\nin 58820 seconds of exposure. Using a power-law spectral fit to only the 0.5-2.5 keV Chandra data (with NH\nfixed to the cluster value, 1.3 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ), we find a\npower-law index of 2.9\u00b10.1, with (absorbed) 0.5-2.5 keV\nX-ray fluxes ranging between 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221214 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221214\nergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 (for different parts of the Chandra data,\nas above). Using this spectrum, the PIMMS tool6 gives\nan absorbed 0.5-2.5 keV X-ray flux of 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221214 ergs\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 for the ROSAT HRI data. This flux is consistent with the upper end of the range of fluxes observed\nwith Chandra .\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nThe 47 Tuc X-ray sources W37, W17 and X4 are very\nprobably qLMXBs. No other identified source types\nobserved in globular clusters show spectral components\nconsistent with the emission from a 10 km radius hydrogen atmosphere, as observed in these objects. Millisecond pulsars show thermal emission from a much\nsmaller area, and at lower luminosities (Zavlin et al.\n2002; Grindlay et al. 2002; Bogdanov et al. 2004). Magnetic CVs show soft, blackbody-like components plus\nharder emission, but with emission radii that are much\nlarger (generally hundreds of km) than the implied radii\n(0.5-2 km) from blackbody fits to these sources. We also\nnote that these three objects are the three X-ray brightest objects (excepting X7, another known qLMXB) not\nyet positively identified in our HST optical identification program (Edmonds et al. 2003a,b). If W17 were a\ncataclysmic variable (or, even less likely, an X-ray active binary), its faint upper limit of U & 24 would produce an unusual X-ray to optical flux ratio, which led\nEdmonds et al. (2003a) to suggest this object as a possible qLMXB. X4 fell outside the HST fields of view ana6\n\nAvailable at http://asc.harvard.edu/toolkit/pimms.jsp\n\n\fNew Quiescent LMXBs in 47 Tuc\nlyzed by Edmonds et al. (2003a), but its X-ray spectral\nsimilarities to W17 are convincing. W37's error circle\nshowed no blue or variable objects, but two bright mainsequence stars fall within a 2\u03c3 error circle (not unusual\nconsidering its projected location at the center of the\ncluster), likely obscuring the true (fainter) companion (as\nfor X7, Edmonds et al. 2002). The far-UV imaging observations of Knigge et al. (2002) include W37's position,\nand may be able to provide stronger constraints on a possible UV counterpart. We conclude that W37's varying\nNH and eclipses indicate that it is a transiently accreting qLMXB, with marked similarities to X5 (HGL03).\nWe also note that W37 is the second qLMXB without a\nrecorded outburst to have an identified period, after X5,\nand that its short period implies a very dim low-mass\ncompanion.\nWe can not rule out possibilities other than qLMXBs\nfor W17 and X4. It is possible that W17 and X4\nare neutron stars without Roche-lobe filling low-mass\ncompanions, accreting from the intracluster medium\n(Pfahl & Rappaport 2001) or from the normal stellar\nwinds of low-mass stellar companions in close orbits, in\nso called pre-LMXB systems (Willems & Kolb 2003). Either of these is possible, but we judge a stellar wind\nmodel to be more likely, because neutron stars that accrete from the intracluster medium must also be able to\naccrete the higher-density wind from a low-mass star,\nand because all the (slowly spinning) neutron stars in\nthe cluster should display signals of accretion from the\nintracluster medium if any do. The low bolometric luminosities from the neutron star surfaces of W17 and X4\nindicate a very low level of time-averaged mass transfer in the Brown et al. (1998) model, or enhanced neutrino cooling. Mass transfer from a pre-LMXB by a\nstellar wind thus seems a reasonable possibility. However, similarly low quiescent luminosities and power-law\ndominated spectra have recently been found for several transient LMXBs: LX (0.5-10 keV)=5 \u00d7 1031 ergs\ns\u22121 for SAX J1808.4-3658 in quiescence (Campana et al.\n2002), LX (0.5-10 keV)=9 \u00d7 1031 ergs s\u22121 (d/8.5 kpc)2\nfor XTE J2123-058 (Tomsick et al. 2004), and LX (0.5-10\nkeV)=1\u00d71032 ergs s\u22121 (d/4.9 kpc)2 for SAX J1810.8-2609\n(Jonker et al. 2004b). This suggests that W17 and X4\nmay be normal qLMXBs. They seem to be generally consistent with the anticorrelation between X-ray luminosity, and the fraction of that luminosity seen in the powerlaw component, suggested by Jonker et al. (2004a). On\nthe other hand, W37 (like the qLMXB in NGC 6397,\nGrindlay et al. 2001b), appears to show a smaller powerlaw component than expected from the anticorrelation of\nJonker et al. (2004a).\nThe faint soft component in W37's spectrum must be\nassociated with W37, since the position of the source\ndoes not change between the brightest and faintest intervals (as would be expected if another X-ray source\nproduced this component). The X-rays might be produced by the rapidly rotating companion star's corona,\nas suggested Bildsten & Rutledge (2000) and disproved\n(Lasota 2000; Kong et al. 2002) for quiescent black hole\nsystems. We can estimate the coronal saturation luminosity of a companion as logLcor = \u22122.9 + 2logRd , where\nLcor and Rd are measured in units of the solar luminosity\nand radius respectively (Fleming et al. 1989). Assuming\na companion mass of 0.3 M\u2299 (appropriate for a lower\n\n5\n\nmain-sequence star in a 3-hour orbit; see \u00a7 2.1), we compute a radius 2.5\u00d71010 cm, and thus a coronal saturation\nluminosity logLcor < 29.8 ergs s\u22121 , which is significantly\nless than the 5 \u00d7 1030 ergs s\u22121 required for the additional component. Scattering of W37's X-rays in an accretion disk wind might produce a similar spectrum, as\nobserved in the eclipsing CVs OY Car, DQ Her and UX\nUMa (Naylor et al. 1988; Mukai et al. 2003; Pratt et al.\n2004). We are not able to make predictions about the\nefficiency of scattering in such a wind, but we do not see\nany outstanding objections to this scenario.\nAlternatively, this faint less-absorbed component\nmight be identified with the power-law component observed in many field qLMXBs (e.g., Campana et al.\n1998; Rutledge et al. 2001b,a), and in W17 and X4. If\nthis identification is correct, then this component must\nbe generated in an extended environment around the\nneutron star, and not near the surface. A rough estimate of its size can be estimated by assuming that the\nplace of its generation is large compared to the size of\nvariations in the accretion disk. (This assumes that the\nvariations in NH observed for the neutron star component are due to material in the accretion disk.) The\naccretion disk is probably of order 4 \u00d7 1010 cm in radius, for typical masses of the components (1.4 and 0.1\nM\u2299 ) and an accretion disk size one-half the orbital separation. Assuming that variations in the accretion disk\nheight may be up to one-tenth the radius of the disk,\nthis suggests that the environment that generates the\nfaint soft component should be larger than 4 \u00d7 109 cm.\nThis is significantly larger than the light-cylinder radius\nfor neutron stars spinning at millisecond periods. If the\nX-rays are generated within or at the edge of the magnetosphere, the size of the emitting region implies that\na pulsar mechanism is operating, and that the observed\nX-rays may be a shock from the pulsar wind as suggested by Campana et al. (1998). The physical nature of\nthe additional component to W37's spectrum cannot be\nconclusively determined from this small amount of data,\nbut the possibility that we are seeing a pulsar wind in a\nsystem with an accretion disk is intriguing.\nW17 and X4 indicate that a class of faint qLMXBs\ndominated by harder nonthermal emission may exist\nin similar numbers as the class of qLMXBs dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star surface (Heinke et al. 2003b). Additional qLMXBs with\nquiescent properties similar to SAX J1808.4-3658 hiding among the low-luminosity sources in 47 Tuc cannot be ruled out, since the neutron star atmosphere\nis not always clearly detectable (Campana et al. 2002).\nThese particular identifications would be difficult with\nshorter exposures, as have been performed for other\nglobular clusters, due to the burying of their telltale\nthermal components under a stronger nonthermal component and/or a blanket of absorbing gas, and their\nsignificantly lower fluxes. However, it will be worthwhile to look for similar objects in the nearest, beststudied clusters. The numbers of faint qLMXBs with\nLX < 1032 ergs s\u22121 may be similar to those of the\nidentified qLMXBs. We note that there are few hard\nqLMXBs among sources with LX = 1032\u221233 ergs s\u22121 ,\nusing the results of detailed X-ray and optical studies\nof 47 Tuc, NGC 6397, and NGC 6752 (Edmonds et al.\n2003a,b; Grindlay et al. 2001b; Pooley et al. 2002), but\n\n\f6\n\nHeinke et al.\n\na significant population below LX < 1032 ergs s\u22121 cannot be ruled out. If we extrapolate from these two faint,\nnonthermally-dominated qLMXBs to the globular cluster system (using their close encounter frequencies, as\nin Heinke et al. 2003b, and Poisson statistics), an additional 56+61\n\u221236 such systems are suggested, added to the\n\u223c100 qLMXBs already anticipated (Pooley et al. 2003;\nHeinke et al. 2003b). Study of faint qLMXB systems\nmay shed light on the interior physics of neutron stars,\nthe physics of accretion at low mass transfer rates, and\npossibly the transition as LMXBs evolve to become millisecond pulsars (Burderi et al. 2002, 2003).\nEarly estimates of the numbers of millisecond pulsars (\u223c10000) and their suggested progenitors, LMXBs\n(12), in globular clusters indicated (for LMXB lifetimes 1/10 those of millisecond pulsars, \u223c1 and 10\nGyr) a large discrepancy in their respective birthrates\n(Kulkarni et al. 1990; Hut et al. 1991), thus implying\nthat other formation processes may have created some\nglobular cluster pulsars (Bailyn & Grindlay 1990). Radio timing surveys of 47 Tuc have identified 22 millisec-\n\nond pulsars (Camilo et al. 2000; Freire et al. 2001), and\nX-ray, optical and radio imaging surveys indicate that\nthe total number of millisecond pulsars in 47 Tuc is\nof order 30 (Heinke et al. 2004; Edmonds et al. 2003b;\nMcConnell et al. 2004; Grindlay et al. 2002). When\nthese constraints are compared with the current number\nof likely quiescent LMXBs in 47 Tuc (5), the birthrate\ndiscrepancy between millisecond pulsars and LMXBs disappears, indicating that LMXBs are probably sufficient\nto produce the observed millisecond pulsars.\n\nWe thank the Penn State team, particularly P.\nBroos, for the development and support of the\nACIS EXTRACT software.

Time is labeled in units of the best-fit period, 11112.5 seconds, with integer phases occurring at the times of mid-eclipse.\nHorizontal bars indicate portions of the data taken for a high-state spectrum (2735,H); the remainder of OBS ID 2735 is taken as a low-state\nspectrum (2735,L). Bottom: Hardness ratio (1-6 keV/0.3-1 keV) lightcurve for W37, corresponding to the same timespan as above, but\nwith 1200 second bins. An anticorrelation can be seen between hardness and count rate.\n\n\fNew Quiescent LMXBs in 47 Tuc\n\n9\n\nFig. 2.- Top: 0.3-8 keV lightcurve of X4 (W125), in 1200 second bins, from first two 2002 observations. Time is labeled in hours. A\nhorizontal bar marks the portion of the data taken for the high-state spectrum. Bottom: Hardness ratio (1-6 keV/0.3-1 keV) lightcurve for\nX4, with 5000 second bins. A correlation can be seen between hardness and count rate.\n\nFig. 3.- Left: Folded lightcurve of all W37 2002 data on 11112.5 second period, with the data repeated over two phases for clarity. A\nclear eclipse can be seen at phase 0. Each bin is 185.2 seconds long.

The contributions from the two components are shown, with the power-law dominating at higher energies.\n\nFig. 5.- X-ray spectra of W37, taken from four different portions of the data with different fluxes. The spectra were fit with an absorbed\nhydrogen atmosphere model plus a separately absorbed power-law. Only the absorption on the hydrogen-atmosphere model was allowed\nto change between data segments. Eight portions were fit to produce the results in Tables 2 and 3, but only four are shown here to reduce\nconfusion. From highest to lowest flux, these are [2735,H], dashed line; [2735,L], squares and dotted (red) line; [2737,L], triangles and solid\n(blue) line; [2736], stars and dash-dotted (green) line.

The lower-flux spectrum (red) shows the\ngreatest differences at higher energies, indicating the difference is not due to photoelectric absorption. (See the electronic edition of the\nJournal for a color version of this figure.)\n\nFig. 7.- X-ray spectra of X4 from the rest of the 2002 observations (except those in Fig. 6), fit with an absorbed hydrogen atmosphere\nmodel and a power-law (with the power-law component allowed to vary between observations) as in Table 2.
