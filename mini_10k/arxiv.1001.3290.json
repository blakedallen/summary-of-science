The Particle Data Group [1] lists 44 N and \u2206 resonances which stem\nmostly from the old analyses of the Karlsruhe-Helsinki (KH) [2] and Carnegie-Mellon (CM) [3]collaborations.\nThe most recent analysis of the SAID group at George Washington University (GWU) [4] includes high precision\ndata from meson factories and data with measurements of the proton recoil polarization. So we should expect the\nnumber of known states to increase. Instead, SAID finds 20 only. This is a much smaller number than the 72 known\nmesonic states, not to speak about the wealth of additional states revealed from the QMC-St-Petersburg analysis of\nCrystal-Barrel LEAR data. Of course, a much greater number of states is expected for (three-body) baryons than\nfor (two-body) mesons. Here, we will address the question wether we have to abandon a large fraction of baryon\nresonances listed by the PDG or if we should include them when interpreting the data in models.\nThe most natural and most popular frame to discuss baryon resonances is the quark model. But other concepts\nhave been proposed. Here, data will be compared to quark-model predictions, to the Skyrme model, to AdS/QCD.\nAt the end, I will address a few key issues in theory and will propose key experiments, which may help to decide\non the validity of the different concepts.\n\nWHY BARYON SPECTROSCOPY?\nWe all have an intuitive knowledge of what \"mass\" means. But, as often in physics, Nature offers surprises.\nAstronomers believe that only a small fraction of the total mass of the Universe is matter in the form as we know\nit. Close galaxies seem to drift apart faster than more remote galaxies (Fig. 1, left); the acceleration is assigned\nto a mythic dark energy (accounting for 73% of the mass of the Universe). The rotational frequencies of stars\nin galaxies do not depend on the distance from the galaxy center (Fig. 1, center); dark matter, e.g. in the form\nof super-symmetric particles, is introduced which gives a 23% mass contribution. \"Normal\" matter makes up the\nremaining 4%. The myriads of stars in the nightly heaven constitute just 1% of the total mass (Fig. 1, right).\nThe matter as we know it provides surprises for us as well. We are accustomed to the fact that electrons carry\nonly an atomic mass fraction of 1/4000; their binding energy is in the sub-ppm range. In nucleons, it is the field\nenergy which outcasts the quark mass by a factor hundred. 99% of the baryon mass does not come of the quark\n\n\fFIGURE 1.

Right: Mass distribution.\n\nmasses but from chiral symmetry breaking. The small current quark mass due to the quark-Higgs interaction is not\nvery important on the hadronic scale.\nThe fundamental theory of strong interactions, QCD, is chirally invariant, it keeps handiness, for the nearly massless quarks. This symmetry is dynamically broken, giving to quarks an effective mass. This\neffect can be studied in lattice gauge calculations [5] which show\nan increase in mass with decreasing momentum transfer (see Fig.\n2). At small q, the effective mass is about 320 MeV. This is called\nthe constituent quark mass. It can be understood using different languages. The bag model assigns the constituent quark mass to absence\nof quark condensates inside of the bag [6]; the Dyson Schwinger\nequation approximates the effective gluon operator [7]; quarks hop\nbetween special field configurations called instantons by flipping the Figure 2. The quark mass as a function\nof the momentum transfer [5]\nquark spin and thus, these acquire mass [8]. How can we learn about\nconstituent quarks? Certainly not by deep inelastic scattering. Proton\ntomography reveals the distribution of linear and orbital angular momenta but information on collective degrees\nof freedom is lost. The wave length with which the proton is explored needs to match the size of the constituents.\nThis is the realm of spectroscopy.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL STATUS\nThe Particle Data Group [1] lists 44 nucleon and \u2206 resonances, Table 1 presents\na recent compilation [9]. Evidence for\nthe existence of baryon resonances is derived mostly from elastic \u03c0 N scattering.\nDepending on the confidence with which\ntheir existence and their properties are\nknown, these resonances are decorated\nwith one, two, three or four stars. Except for the four-star resonances, the evidence is challenged by a careful GWU\nanalysis [4] and only those boldfaced in\nTable 1 survive. Spin and parity of resonances are given in the form N1/2\u2212 (1535)\nwhich gives spin and parity directly instead of N(1535)S11 used by the Particle\nData Group.\n\nTable 1.N and \u2206 resonances.

At present, we cannot decide if the KH and CM analyses pick up some noise or if resonances\nare lost in the GWU analysis by the applied smoothing procedure. But for a few resonances, seen in the KH and\nCM analyses and not seen in the GWU analysis of elastic \u03c0 N scattering data, this question can be studied. We\ngive three examples where resonances found by KH and CM and disclaimed by GWU are required in inelastic\nreactions. Note that the relevant \u03c0 N \u2192 \u03c0 N amplitudes [4] are included in the fit. KH, CM, and GWU fit only these\namplitudes; the inelasticity is unconstrained by data. In the BnGa analysis, most inelastic channels are known\nfrom photoproduction and only few inelastic channels (mainly with vector mesons) are treated as \"black box\".\n\n12\n\n2\n\n\u2206 \u03c7 /100\n\nThe \u22063/2+ (1600) from \u03c0 + p \u2192 \u03a3+ K + :\nIm T(P33 )\nFig. 3 shows the imaginary part of the elastic P33 \u03c0 N scattering amplitude 0.25\n0.12\nabove \u2206(1232).

The data were included in a general fit to a large number\nof different inelastic reactions and to the GWU elastic amplitudes. The resulting P33 amplitude is shown as thick\n(blue) curve. The amplitude follows closely the KH amplitude. The analysis requires to introduce \u22063/2+ (1600).\nThe need for the resonance can be seen from the differential distribution and the induced \u03a3+ polarization. Thus\nwe believe that the \u22063/2+ (1600) is definitely confirmed with a pole position at M = 1540+40\n\u221280, \u0393 = 230 \u00b1 40 MeV.\n\n10\n\nK\u039b+K\u03a3\n\n8\n6\n4\nK\u039b\n\n2\n0\n-2\n1800\n\n1850\n\n1900\n\n1950\n\n2000\n\n2050\n\nM(P13), MeV\n\n\u03c72\n\nFigure 4.\nas a function of the\nimposed N3/2+ (1900) mass.\n1.7< W < 1.9\n\nThe N3/2+ (1900) from photoproduction of hyperons:\nVery sensitive data on photoproduction of hyperons are now available on\n\u03b3 p \u2192 \u039bK + , \u03b3 p \u2192 \u03a30 K + , and \u03b3 p \u2192 \u03a3+ K 0 . Fig. 4 shows the \u03c7 2 of the BnGa\nfit as a function of the assumed N3/2+ (1900) mass. The data base includes\nhigh-statistics angular distributions, several single (\u03a3, T and P) and double\npolarization observables (Cx ,Cz , Ox , Oz ).

For the interpretation of the baryon spectrum, all resonances of Table 1 will be used. For further\ninformation on the BnGa analysis, see talks by Anisovich and Sarantsev at this conference.\n\nINTERPRETATION\nQuark models:\nThe quark model provides the most natural and most accepted picture of the baryon excitation spectrum. Ingredients are constituent quarks with defined rest masses, a confinement potential (mostly linear) and some residual\ninteraction. In the celebrated Isgur-Karl model and its later \"relativized\" refinements, an effective one-gluon exchange is chosen as residual interaction. The Bonn group starts from a Bethe-Salpeter equation; the linear confinement potential has a full Dirac structure. Instanton-induced interactions are responsible for the N \u2212 \u2206 mass\nsplitting. The quark models are very successful in explaining the properties of baryon ground states and low-mass\nexcitations; they fail to reproduce the masses of radial excitations and predict many more baryon resonances than\nfound in experiment.\nAdS/QCD:\nThe Maldacena correspondence relates conformal strongly-coupled theories in space-time to a weakly-coupled\n(\"gravitational\") theory in a five dimensional Anti-de Sitter space embedded in six dimensions. Gravitational theories can be solved analytically, the solutions can be mapped into space-time and compared to data. There is a\n(heuristic) mapping of quantum mechanical operators to operators in Ads/QCD. The fifth dimension in AdS called\nz can be interpreted as virtuality or distance between constituents. For z \u2192 0, constituents are asymptotically free.\nConfinement can be enforced by a hard boundary z < zmax = 1/\u039bQCD (hard wall) or by a soft wall due to a dilation\nfield (or penalty function) increasing as z2 .\nAdS/QCD relates masses to the orbital angular momentum L (Fig. 6). In quark models, relativity plays an\nimportant role, and only the total angular momentum J is defined. Experimentally, there are a few striking examples\nwhere the leading orbital angular momentum and the spin can be identified. To give one example: the four states\n\u22061/2+ (1910), \u22063/2+ (1920), \u22065/2+ (1905), and \u22067/2+ (1950) are isolated in mass. They obviously form a spin-quartet\nof resonances with L = 2, S = 3/2. Small admixtures of other components are not excluded.\nFigure 6: One-parameter fit to the \u2206 excitation spectrum.

A problem arises when these dynamically generated resonances are predicted atop the quark-model\nstates, or when the light quark baryons are disregarded altogether and replaced by a systematics of meson\u2013baryon\nexcitations. The pole structure of N1/2\u2212 (1535) and N1/2\u2212 (1650), e.g., was studied by D\u00f6ring et al. [10]. They\ngenerated N1/2\u2212 (1535) dynamically and introduced two additional poles, one for N1/2\u2212 (1650) and a third one.\nThe latter pole moves far into the complex plane and provides an almost energy independent background while\nthe dynamically generated N1/2\u2212 (1535) pole appears as a stable object. This could mean that N1/2\u2212 (1535) is fully\nunderstood by the interaction of the baryon and meson, into which it disintegrates. It can be interpreted that the\nobserved N1/2\u2212 (1535) is dynamically generated and the state predicted by the quark model is missing. The latter\ninterpretation seems unacceptable to me.\n\n\fRestoration of chiral symmetry?\nIn contrary to expectations based on the quark model in harmonic oscillator approximation, the masses of baryon\nresonances do not increase with alternating states of even and odd parity; often, states having the same J but\nopposite parities are approximately degenerate in mass (see Table 2). At low mass, N1/2\u2212 (1535) is much heavier\nthan its chiral partner, the proton. In meson spectroscopy, the \u03c1 mass is much below the a1 (1260) mass. The\nmass difference is assigned to a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Glozman [11] and others argue that at\nhigh-mass excitations, details of the potential responsible for spontaneous chiral breaking are irrelevant: chiral\nsymmetry could be restored in highly excited baryons. The alternative interpretation of the occurrence spin-parity\npartners, AdS/QCD, is criticized because of Table 2.

For this reason, we do not include this\nmodel in the quantitative comparison. Also, models generating resonances dynamically are not suitable for a numerical comparison with data, since only a part of the spectrum is calculated. Well suited are quark models,\nAdS/QCD, and the Skyrme model (even though this model was left out in the above discussion of models). We use\ntwo quark models for the comparison, the relativized quark model of Capstick and Isgur [14] and the relativistic\nBonn model [15]. The Skyrme model [16] has two parameters only but predicts less than half the number of the\nobserved states, and the mass predictions are rather inaccurate. The best agreement is achieved with the gravitational model [17], see Table 3. A breakdown of contributions of individual resonances can be found in [18].\nThe agreement between AdS/QCD and the data is absolutely amazing. Obviously, the two parameters used to\ndescribe the data correspond to important physical quantities. The parameter a in front of L + N is related to the\nmaximum distance between constituents, it is related to the size of the baryon. The second parameter b is used to\nconstruct an operator in AdS which reduces the size proportional to the diquark fraction with vanishing spin and\nisospin in the baryon: in this version of AdS/QCD, \"good diquark\" are smaller in size compared to other diquarks.\nThe second observation is that the mass depends on the orbital angular momentum L implying that we have\na non-relativistic situation. We are used to describe the nucleon as bound state of three constituent quarks each\nhaving 1/3 of the nucleon mass. The constituent-quark is generated by chiral symmetry breaking, by the energy\nof the QCD fields. The quark model assumes that the constituent quark is an object which can be accelerated to\nrelativistic energies; chiral symmetry and chiral symmetry breaking is not effected. This does not need to be the\ncase. Glozman assumes that chiral symmetry is restored. This is the assumption of a central Mexican-hat-like\npotential where chiral symmetry is dynamically broken at the origin of the hadron. The use of a mean field which\nleads to a Mexican-hat potential in the rest frame of the nucleon is at least a debateable assumption. The success\nof AdS/QCD suggests that constituent quarks expand and become more massive when a baryon is excited to high\nenergy. Chiral symmetry is broken in an extended volume, and this might be the reason for the increase in mass.\n\nTable 3.

The \u039b(1405) has\nsuch a low mass since it has not only one good diquark but all three pairs have vanishing spin and isospin.\nMultiplicity of resonances and the existence glueballs and hybrids:\nThere is the well-known problem of the missing resonances: the number of baryon resonances predicted in quark\nmodels exceeds by far the number of observed states. The number of baryon resonances can be counted using\nharmonic oscillator wave function, with two oscillators \u03c1 and \u03bb . Quark models predict, for given ~L and N, a\nmultitude of states satisfying ~l\u03c1 +~l\u03bb = ~L and n\u03c1 + n\u03bb = N. With increasing L and N, the number of predicted states\nexplodes: expected are, e.g. two N1/2+ states in the second shell, seven N1/2\u2212 states in the third shell, ten N1/2+\nstates in the forth shell. This problem is partly cured in AdS/QCD where at most two J = 1/2 states are expected\nin any shell.\nThere could be a second problem of too large a number of predicted states. In the quark model, there is e.g.\none nucleon resonance with L = 1, S = 1/2, one state with L = 1, S = 3/2. The possibility of mixing admitted,\nwe can still identify the N1/2\u2212 (1535) with the predicted L = 1, S = 1/2 quark model state, and N1/2\u2212 (1650)\nwith L = 1, S = 3/2. But there is evidence that N1/2\u2212 (1535) can be generated dynamically from N \u03b7 -\u039bK-\u03a3K\ncoupled-channel scattering dynamics. Hence there could be a quark model state N1/2\u2212 (1535) and a dynamically\n\u2032\ngenerated N1/2\n\u2212 (1535). Zou [18] proposes that the observed N1/2\u2212 (1535) has a large (qqq)(qq\u0304) component with all\n\u2032\u2032\nquarks in S-wave. If N1/2\u2212 (1535) = \u03b1 |qqq > +\u03b2 |(qqq)(qq\u0304) >, is there an orthogonal resonance N1/2\n\u2212 = \u03b2 |qqq >\n\u2217\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212\u03b1 |(qqq)(qq\u0304) > and, if so, at which mass? Do hybrid configurations N1/2\u2212 = \u03b1 |qqq > +\u03b2 |(qqq)(G) > add to\nthe list of expected resonances? Experimentally, none of these additional states has been observed.\nIt seems to be worthwhile to stress that the number of bosons is not a well-defined quantity. I propose a view in\nwhich the interactions between three (current) quarks provide the primary forces to stabilize a baryon. The three\nquarks acquire their constituent dynamical mass. Gluons may polarize the vacuum, correlated quark-antiquark\npairs are created. Depending on the dynamics, these qq\u0304 pairs may have long-range correlations and may move\nfreely within a hadron as Cooper-pairs or massless Goldstone bosons leading to a fast flavor exchange. Or they\nmay evolve into massive quarks. If their masses approach the mass of \"normal\" constituent quarks, we rather speak\nabout a nucleon-meson molecule or - invoking color chemistry - about five-quark states. However, the origin of\nall baryons is the three-quark component. The actual decomposition is a question how the QCD vacuum responds\nto the primary color source of three quarks at a given mass and with given quantum numbers. The response can\nbe very different, in particular it will depend critically on the presence of close-by thresholds, but it is a unique\nresponse. There is no \"hidden variable\" which decides that three quarks with L = 1, S = 1/2 will go either into a\nN, N \u2032 , N \u2032\u2032 , or into a N \u2032\u2032\u2032 configuration, or into different mixtures of these Fock components. There is only one state.\nThis view has attractive features; it reduces the number of expected but unobserved states. It emphasizes the\nview that quark-model resonances, dynamically generated resonances, five-quark states are different approaches to\nunderstand the same object with its complicated internal structure. The different approaches are all legitimate, none\nof them carries the truth, and each approach should be tested if the predictions are not in conflict with firm results\nof other approaches. If the view is extended to the mesonic sector, there are some unfamiliar conclusions. First, the\nraison d'etre of all scalar mesons is their qq\u0304 component, even of the \u03c3 . But this is also a trivial statement: without\nQCD, there are no nuclear forces. Second, if there is only one scalar isoscalar state (plus radial excitations), with all\nconfigurations qq\u0304, qqq\u0304q\u0304, qq\u0304G, \u03c0\u03c0 , K K\u0304, etc. included, then one further possibility, the GG glueball, is likely also a\nFock component in its wave function. In this view, also the GG component does not lead to an extra state, there is no\nsupernumerocity of resonances expected. I am aware of claims that supernumerocity has been proven; the Particle\nData Group is strongly biassed into this direction. I maintain that these claims are experimentally not sound, see\n[20], for a review. Presumably, most scalar isoscalar mesons are realized as flavor singlets or octets. The SU(3)\nflavor singlets are very wide and form the continuous scalar background, a \"narrow\" f0 (1370) does not exist. Only\nthe octet mesons have normal hadronic widths; these are f0 (1500), f0 (1760) (which includes f0 (1710), f0 (1790),\nf0 (1810)), and f0 (2100). The flavor decomposition of the low-mass f0 (980) and f0 (500) are strongly influenced\nby the \u03c0\u03c0 and K K\u0304 threshold. Scalar mesons have a significant four-quark component but their qq\u0304 component is\nmandatory: in SU(3), there are nine qq\u0304 states and also nine qqq\u0304q\u0304 states respecting the Pauli principle. In SU(4),\nthere are 16 qq\u0304 and there could exist 36 qqq\u0304q\u0304 states, but none of these 20 additional states has been observed.\nInterestingly, the view forbids non-exotic hybrids, since they are absorbed into the wave function of qq\u0304 mesons\ncarrying the same quantum numbers. Neither the existence of exotic hybrids is excluded by the arguments given\nabove, nor the existence of pentaquarks in a non-(qqq) configuration.\n\n\fWHAT IS NEEDED?\nIt ain't necessarily be so:\nThe interpretation depends, of course, heavily on the existing data. Hence it is of greatest importance to confirm\nor refute as many of the states seen in KH and CM and not seen in GWU analyses as possible. Photoproduction\nexperiments start to have a significant impact. Experiments with polarized photon beams and polarized targets have\nalready taken a significant amount of data; results are eagerly waited for. Hyperon photoproduction experiments\nbenefit from the self-analysing power of hyperon decays. Some double polarization variables hit the value 1. This\nmay indicate that a smaller number of observables (and not 8) is already sufficient to constrain the amplitudes\nfully. At least, the BnGa PWA group noticed that there are much less ambiguities in defining the partial wave\namplitudes for hyperon photoproduction when the amplitudes are constrained by d \u03c3 /d\u03a9, \u03a3, P, Cx ,Cz , Ox , and Oz .\nHence I believe we are at a point where we soon will be able to decide which resonances exist in the mass range\nbelow 2 GeV or, perhaps, 2.2 GeV.\nSearch for missing quark model states:\nIn the second oscillator shell with L = 2, quark models predict states in which the spatial wave function are fully\nantisymmetric, in which the orbital angular momenta ~l\u03c1 and ~l\u03bb are both one and couple to L = 1. If these states\nexist, they likely do not decay into N \u03c0 but prefer a cascade where the two oscillators de-excite successively.\nAccording to the AdS/QCD mass formula (and its interpretation) one can assume that the mass of this spin\ndoublet N1/2+ and N3/2+ should be between 1.7 and 1.8 GeV. The preferred decay mode could be the cascade\nN1/2+ \u2192 N1/2\u2212 (1535)\u03c0 \u2192 N \u03b7\u03c0 or N3/2+ \u2192 N3/2\u2212 (1520)\u03c0 \u2192 N \u03c0\u03c0 where all decays proceed via S-wave.\nWhat is the mass of the first \u22067/2\u2212 resonance?\nWe have already mentioned the quartet of states \u22061/2+ (1910), \u22063/2+ (1920), \u22065/2+ (1905), and \u22067/2+ (1950). The\nfirst three states have spin-parity partners \u22061/2\u2212 (1900), \u22063/2\u2212 (1940), \u22065/2\u2212 (1930). In quark models, the masses of\npositive parity states are well reproduced, those of the negative-parity states are unexpectedly low. In AdS/QCD,\nthe positive-parity states have L = 2, N = 0, the negative-parity states L = 1, N = 1, respectively, and are predicted\nto be degenerate in mass. Since ~L + ~S yields only J = 1/2\u2212 , J = 3/2\u2212, and J = 5/2\u2212 negative-parity states, but\nJ = 1/2+ , * * * J = 7/2+ for L = 2, S = 3/2, the absence of a parity partner of \u22067/2+ (1950) is expected. Instead,\n2184 MeV is predicted as \u22067/2\u2212 mass, close to the PDG resonance \u22067/2\u2212 (2200).\nIf chiral symmetry were restored in high-mass baryons, the \u22067/2\u2212 mass would need to be degenerate\nin mass with \u22067/2+ (1950). The mass is 2200 MeV, hence we could conclude that AdS/QCD is favored.\nHowever, the \u22067/2\u2212 (2200) mass determination is not very reliable. In\nTable 4 we list the Particle Data group entries for \u22067/2\u2212 (2200). The Table 4: PDG entries for \u22067/2\u2212 (2200).\nvalues a very consistent but the resonance is given one-star only. In the\nMass [MeV] Width[MeV] Ref.\nGWU analysis [4], the state is not seen.

To give an\nexample: there is a a4 (2040) meson with J PC = 4++ but the lowest mass partner with J PC = 4\u2212+ is \u03c04 (2250), and\nthe same observation can be made for the lowest-mass states in the series J PC = 1\u2212\u2212 , J PC = 2++ , J PC = 3\u2212\u2212 , * * * .\nHence spin-parity partners are missing for the most important states. The following argument by Glozman [22]\nsuggests a dynamical reason why the postulated J PC = 4\u2212+ state at 2040 MeV was not observed: mesons in\nthe high-mass region stem mostly from the QMC-St-Petersburg analysis of Crystal-Barrel LEAR data on p\u0304p\nannihilation in flight. And the p\u0304p system couples to J PC = 4++ with L = 4 while for formation of a J PC = 4\u2212+\nstate, L = 5 is required. Hence \u03c04 (2250) could be suppressed. It is worthwhile to note that the observed pattern is\nis expected in AdS/QCD. Mesons \u2013 except scalar and pseudoscalar mesons \u2013 are well described by the formula in\nthe caption of Fig. 6, if the \"3/2\" is replaced by \"1/2\".\nIn photoproduction or pion-induced reactions, there is no such angular momentum suppression; hence the\nsearch for the lowest-mass \u22067/2\u2212 resonance seems to be the most rewarding case to decide if quark models or\nAdS/QCD describe best the mass spectrum, or if chiral symmetry is restored at high excitation energies.\nLimits of dynamical generated resonances:\nThe range of applicability of the method to generate resonances dynamically has to be understood. As experimen-\n\n\ftalist, I am ready to believe that N1/2\u2212 (1535) can be generated dynamically from its decay products, also that it\ncould have, at large distances, a sizable five-quark or molecular component in its Fock-space expansion. But it is\ndifficult to accept that N1/2\u2212 (1535) and N3/2\u2212 (1520) are fundamentally different objects. Oset in his contribution\nto this conference [23] constructed scalar and tensor mesons from vector-vector interactions. The isoscalar scalar\nmesons are found at 1512 MeV and 1726 MeV. This looks like a success as well as the tensor meson found at\n\u2217\n1275 MeV. However, the next tensor at 1525 couples with similar strength to K \u2217 K , \u03c9\u03c9 , \u03c6 \u03c9 , \u03c6 \u03c6 , but not to \u03c1\u03c1 .\nThis is in striking conflict with what we know about f2 (1525): it is a ss\u0304 state, the tensor mesons have a mixing\nangle close to the ideal one. OZI rule violating couplings like the one into \u03c6 \u03c9 are highly suppressed. Also the\nisovector states are a failure. If \u03c1\u03c1 generates f2 (1270), \u03c1\u03c9 must generate a2 (1320); the predicted lowest isoscalar\ntensor mass is 1567 MeV and its scalar companion is predicted to have 1777 MeV. In my view, it is important to\nfind out the conditions for a meaningful unitarization of chiral amplitudes, and not to enjoy the achievements and\nto neglect the failures.\nExcited states on the lattice:\nLattice gauge calculation have entered the difficult task to explore the spectrum of baryon resonances and\nto address their finite width. In the Introduction, I showed how the mass of a quark evolves with decreasing\nmomentum transfer. The calculation was done for a quark propagator irrespective of its environment. According\nto the discussion above, the constituent quark mass should depend on its neighborhood; it should be lighter in the\nnucleon than in the \u2206(1232), and massive in highly excited states.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBaryons have played a very important role in the development of particle physics, starting from the - at that time mysterious proton and neutron magnetic moments, the discovery of the \u2206(1232) by Fermi and his collaborators, to\nthe discovery of SU(3) and the insight that quarks need an extra degree of freedom which is now known as color.\nThe concept of chiral symmetry and chiral symmetry breaking is at the root of modern strong interaction physics.\nWith the new tools, in experiment and theory, we have the chance for a new understanding of strong interaction\ndynamics in the confinement region.\nI would like to thank B.
