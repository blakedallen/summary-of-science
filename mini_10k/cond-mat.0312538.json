The ground-state properties of the gas confined in highly elongated harmonic traps are determined within the local density\napproximation. For strong attractive effective interactions the existence of a molecular TonksGirardeau gas is predicted. The frequency of the lowest breathing mode is calculated as a function\nof the coupling strength for both attractive and repulsive interactions.\nPACS numbers:\n\nThe study of cold quasi-1d atomic quantum gases\npresents a very active area of research. So far, most of\nthe experimental [1] and theoretical [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] investigations have been devoted to quasi-1d Bose gases and, in\nparticular, to the strongly-interacting Tonks-Girardeau\ngas, which can be mapped to a gas of non-interacting\nfermions [2, 7, 8]. Quasi-1d atomic Fermi gases have not\nbeen realized experimentally yet.\nThe role of interactions in quasi-1d atomic Fermi gases\nhas been studied mainly in connection with Luttinger\nliquid theory [9, 10]. Recati et al. [10] investigate the\nproperties of a two-component Fermi gas with repulsive interspecies interactions confined in highly-elongated\nharmonic traps. In the limit of weak and strong coupling these authors relate the parameters of the Luttinger Hamiltonian, which describe the low-energy properties of the gas, to the microscopic parameters of the\nsystem. The Luttinger model is used to analyze the manifestations of the uncoupled dynamics of spin and density\nwaves (spin-charge separation).\nThis Letter investigates the properties of inhomogeneous quasi-1d two-component Fermi gases under harmonic confinement with attractive and repulsive interspecies interactions. The present study is based on the\nexact equation of state of a homogeneous 1d system of\nfermions with zero-range attractive [11, 12] and repulsive\n[13] interactions treated within the local density approximation (LDA). We calculate the energy per particle, the\nsize of the cloud, and the frequency of the lowest compressional mode as a function of the effective 1d coupling\nconstant, including infinitely strong attractive and repulsive interactions. Moreover, for attractive interactions\nwe discuss the cross-over from the weak- to the strongcoupling regime and point out the possibility of forming\na mechanically stable molecular Tonks-Girardeau gas.\nQuasi-1d two-component Fermi gases with effectively\nattractive and repulsive 1d interspecies interactions can\nbe realized in highly-elongated traps. The behavior of\natomic gases tightly-confined in two directions can, if\nthe confinement is chosen properly, be characterized to a\nvery good approximation by an effective 1d coupling constant, g1d , which encapsulates the atom-atom interaction\n\nstrength. This coupling constant can be tuned to essentially any value, including zero and \u00b1\u221e, by varying the\n3d s-wave scattering length a3d through application of\nan external magnetic field in the proximity of a Feshbach\nresonance.\nIn homogeneous 1d Fermi gases with attractive interactions, sound waves propagate with a well defined velocity, while spin waves exhibit a gap [12]. Furthermore,\nin the strong-coupling regime, the ground state is comprised of bosonic molecules, consisting of two fermions\nwith different spin whose spatial size is much smaller\nthan the average intermolecular distance [12]. Consequently, BCS-type equations have been discussed for effectively attractive 1d interactions [14]. The quasi-1d\nmolecular Bose gas discussed here has similarities with\nthe formation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) from a 3d Fermi sea close to a magnetic atomatom Feshbach resonance [15], which may allow study of\nthe BCS-BEC cross-over [16]. In contrast to the 3d case,\nthe cross-over from the weak-coupling regime of large,\noverlapping Cooper pairs to the strong-coupling regime\nof small, tightly bound Bose pairs can be investigated in\n1d within an exactly solvable model.\nConsider a two-component atomic Fermi gas confined\nin a highly-elongated trap. The fermionic atoms are assumed to belong to the same atomic species, that is, to\nhave the same mass m, but to be trapped in different hyperfine states \u03c3, where \u03c3 represents a generalized spin or\nangular momentum, \u03c3 =\u2191 or \u2193. The trapping potential\nis assumed to be harmonic and axially symmetric,\nVtrap =\n\nN\nX\n1\ni=1\n\n2\n\n\u0001\nm \u03c9\u03c12 \u03c12i + \u03c9z2 zi2 .\n\n(1)\n\np\nHere, \u03c1i = x2i + yi2 and zi denote, respectively, the radial and longitudinal coordinate of the ith atom; \u03c9\u03c1 and\n\u03c9z denote, respectively, the angular frequency in the radial and longitudinal direction; and N denotes the total\nnumber of atoms. We require that the anisotropy parameter \u03bb \u226a 1, where \u03c9z = \u03bb\u03c9\u03c1 , so that the transverse\nmotion is \"frozen\" to zero point oscillations.

This condition is fulfilled if N \u03bb \u226a 1.\nThe outlined scenario can be realized experimentally with\npresent-day technology using optical traps.\nIf the Fermi gas is kinematically in 1d, it can be described by an effective 1d Hamiltonian with contact interactions,\nH = N h\u0304\u03c9\u03c1 +\n\n0\nH1d\n\n+\n\nN\nX\n1\ni=1\n\n2\n\nm\u03c9z2 zi2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n0\nH1d\n=\u2212\n\nN\u2191 N\u2193\nN\nX\nX\nh\u03042 X \u2202 2\n\u03b4(zi \u2212 zj )\n+\ng\n1d\n2\n2m i=1 \u2202zi\ni=1 j=1\n\n(3)\n\nand N = N\u2191 + N\u2193 .

By varying a3d , it is possible to\ngo adiabatically from the strongly-interacting repulsive\nc\nregime (g1d \u2192 +\u221e or a3d <\n\u223c a3d ), through the weaklyinteracting regime (g1d \u223c 0) to the strongly-interacting\nc\nattractive regime (g1d \u2192 \u2212\u221e or a3d >\n\u223c a3d ).\nFor two fermions with different spin the Hamiltonian\n0\nH1d\n, Eq. (3), supports one bound state with binding\nenergy \u01ebbound = \u2212h\u03042 /(ma21d ) and spatial extent \u223c a1d\nfor g1d < 0, and no bound state for g1d > 0, that is,\nthe molecular state becomes exceedingly weakly-bound\nand spatially-delocalized as g1d \u2192 0\u2212 . In the following\nwe investigate the properties of a gas with N fermions,\nN\u2191 = N\u2193 , for both effectively attractive and repulsive 1d\ninteractions with and without longitudinal confinement.\n0\nTo start with, consider the Hamiltonian H1d\n, Eq. (3),\nwhich describes a homogeneous 1d two-component Fermi\n0\ngas. The ground state energy Ehom of H1d\nhas been calculated exactly using Bethe's ansatz for both attractive\n[11] and repulsive [13] interactions, and can be expressed\nin terms of the linear number density n1d , n1d = N/L,\nwhere L is the size of the system,\nEhom\nh\u03042 n21d\n=\ne(\u03b3) .\nN\n2m\n\n(6)\n\nThe dimensionless parameter \u03b3 is proportional to the\ncoupling constant g1d , \u03b3 = mg1d /(h\u03042 n1d ), while its absolute value is inversely proportional to the 1d gas parameter n1d |a1d |, |\u03b3| = 2/n1d |a1d |. The function e(\u03b3) is\nobtained by solving a set of integral equations [17], which\nis similar to that derived by Lieb and Liniger [18] for 1d\nbosons with repulsive contact interactions. To obtain the\nenergy per particle, Eq. (6), we solve these integral equations for attractive (\u03b3 < 0) [11] and repulsive interactions\n(\u03b3 > 0) [13].\nFigure 2 shows the energy per particle, Ehom /N (solid\nline), the chemical potential \u03bchom , \u03bchom = dEhom /dN\n\n\f3\n(dashed line), and the velocity of sound c (inset), which\nis obtained from the compressibility of the system, mc2 =\nn1d \u2202\u03bchom /\u2202n1d , as a function of the interaction strength\n\u03b3. In the weak coupling limit, |\u03b3| \u226a 1, \u03bchom is given by\n\u03bchom =\n\n\u03c0 2 h\u03042 n21d\nh\u03042 n21d\n+\u03b3\n+ *** ,\n4 2m\n2m\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side is the energy\nof an ideal two-component atomic Fermi gas, and the second term is the mean-field energy, which accounts for interactions. The chemical potential increases with increasing \u03b3, and reaches an asymptotic value for \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e [10]\n(indicated by a horizontal arrow in Fig. 2),\n\u03bchom = \u03c0 2\n\n16\u03c0 2 ln(2) h\u03042 n21d\nh\u03042 n21d\n\u2212\n+ *** .\n2m\n3\u03b3\n2m\n\n(8)\n\nThe first term on the right hand side coincides with the\nchemical potential of a one-component ideal 1d Fermi gas\nwith N atoms. Interestingly, for \u03b3 \u226b 1, the strong atomatom repulsion between atoms with different spin plays\nthe role of an effective Pauli principle.\nFor attractive interactions and large enough |\u03b3| the\nenergy per particle is negative (see Fig. 2), reflecting the\nexistence of a molecular Bose gas, which consists of N/2\ndiatomic molecules with binding energy \u01ebbound .

Importantly, the compressibility remains positive for \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u221e [a horizontal arrow\nin the inset of Fig. 2 indicates the asymptotic value of c,\nc = \u03c0h\u0304n1d /(4m)], which implies that two-component 1d\nFermi gases are mechanically stable even in the stronglyattractive regime. In contrast, the ground state of 1d\nBose gases with g1d < 0 has negative compressibility [20]\nand is hence mechanically unstable. The formation of\na quasi-1d molecular gas discussed here has some analogies to the formation of a 3d molecular BEC [21] and the\nBCS-BEC cross-over for 3d Fermi systems [16].\nUsing the solutions for the homogeneous twocomponent 1d Fermi gas, we now describe the inhomogeneous gas, Eq. (2), within the LDA [4, 5, 10]. This\napproximation is applicable if the size R of the cloud\nis much larger than the harmonic oscillator\nlength az\np\nin the longitudinal direction, az = h\u0304/m\u03c9z , implying\n\u01ebF \u226b h\u0304\u03c9z and N \u226b 1. The chemical potential \u03bc of the\ninhomogeneous system can be determined from the local\nequilibrium condition,\n1\n\u03bc = \u03bchom [n1d (z)] + m\u03c9z2 z 2 ,\n2\n\n(10)\n\nFIG. 3: Energy per particle, E/N (solid lines), and size of the\ncloud, R (dashed lines), for an inhomogeneous two component\n1d Fermi gas as a function of the coupling strength N a21d /a2z\nfor repulsive (g1d > 0) and attractive (g1d < 0) interactions.\n\nRR\nand the normalization condition N = \u2212R n1d (z)dz,\nwhere p\nz is measured from the center of the trap and\nR =\n2\u03bc\u2032 /(m\u03c9z2 ), where \u03bc\u2032 = \u03bc for g1d > 0 and\n\u2032\n\u03bc = \u03bc + |\u01ebbound |/2 for g1d < 0. The normalization condition can be reexpressed in terms of the dimensionless\nchemical potential \u03bc\u0303 and the dimensionless density \u00f11d\n[\u03bc\u0303 = \u03bc\u2032 /(h\u03042 /2ma21d) and \u00f11d = |a1d |n1d ],\na2\n=\nN 1d\na2z\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\u0303\n\n0\n\n\u00f11d (\u03bc\u0303 \u2212 x)\n\u221a\ndx .\nx\n\n(11)\n\nThis expression emphasizes that the coupling strength\nis determined by N a21d /a2z ; N a21d /a2z \u226b 1 corresponds\nto the weak coupling and N a21d /a2z \u226a 1 to the strong\ncoupling regime, irrespective of whether the interactions\nare attractive or repulsive [5].\nFigure 3 shows the energy per particle E/N and the\nsize R of the cloud as a function of the coupling strength\nN a21d /a2z for positive and negative g1d calculated within\nthe LDA for an inhomogeneous two-component 1d Fermi\ngas. \u221a\nCompared to the non-interacting gas, for which\nR = N az , R increases for repulsive interactions and\n2\n2\ndecreases for attractive interactions.\n\u221a For N a1d /az \u226a 1,\nthe strongly\nR reaches the asymptotic value 2N az for p\nrepulsive regime, g1d \u2192 +\u221e, and the value N/2az for\nthe strongly attractive regime, g1d \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The shrinking\nof the cloud for attractive interactions reflects the formation of tightly bound molecules. In the limit g1d \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nthe energy per particle approaches \u01ebbound /2 + N h\u0304\u03c9z /4,\nindicating the formation of a molecular bosonic TonksGirardeau gas, consisting of N/2 molecules.\nUsing a sum rule approach, the frequency \u03c9 of the\nlowest compressional (breathing) mode of harmonically\ntrapped 1d gases can be calculated from the mean-square\nsize of the cloud hz 2 i [5],\n\u03c9 2 = \u22122\n\nhz 2 i\n.\ndhz 2 i/d\u03c9z2\n\n(12)\n\n\f4\n\nIn the weak and strong coupling regime (N a21d /a2z \u226b 1\nand \u226a 1, respectively), hz 2 i has the same dependence on\n\u03c9z as the ideal 1d Fermi gas. Consequently, \u03c9 is in these\nlimits given by 2\u03c9z , irrespective of whether the interaction is repulsive or attractive. Solid lines in Fig. 3 show\n\u03c9 2 , determined numerically from Eq. (12), as a function\nof the interaction strength N a21d /a2z . A non-trivial behavior of \u03c9 2 as a function of N a21d /a2z is visible. To gain\n\nfurther insight, we calculate the first correction \u03b4\u03c9 to the\nbreathing mode frequency \u03c9 [\u03c9 = 2\u03c9z (1 + \u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9z + * * *)]\nanalytically for weak repulsive and attractive interactions, as well as for strong repulsive and attractive interactions. For the weak coupling regime, we find \u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9z =\n\u00b1(4/3\u03c0 2 )/(N a21d /a2z )1/2 , where the minus sign applies\nto repulsive interactions and the plus sign to attractive\ninteractions. For\nregime, we find\n\u221a the strong coupling\n2\n2 1/2\n\u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9z = \u2212[16 2 ln(2)/15\u03c0 2 ](N\na\n/a\n)\nfor repulsive\n\u221a 1d z\ninteractions and \u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9z = (8 2/15\u03c0 2 )(N a21d /a2z )1/2 for\nattractive interactions. Dashed lines in Fig. 4 show the\nresulting analytic expansions for \u03c9 2 . These expansions\ndescribe the lowest breathing mode frequency quite well\nover a fairly large range of interaction strengths. Not\nsurprisingly, their validity breaks down for N a21d /a2z \u223c 1.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the cross-over from\nweak to strong coupling of quasi-1d harmonically trapped\ntwo-component Fermi gases with both repulsive and attractive effective interactions. The frequency of the lowest breathing mode, which can provide an experimental\nsignature of the cross-over, is calculated. We predict the\nexistence of a stable molecular Tonk-Girardeau gas in\nthe strongly attractive regime. We believe that our results, which are derived using a 1d model Hamiltonian\nwith contact interactions, hold when more realistic interactions are considered and when the transverse motion\nis treated explicitly.\nAcknowledgements: GEA, SG and LPP acknowledge\nsupport by the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell' Universit\u00e0\ne della Ricerca (MIUR).
