Assuming\nthat the force field arises from a Poisson field in Rd , d \u2265 4, and the initial velocity of\nthe particle is sufficiently large, we describe the asymptotic behavior of the particle.\n\nMathematical Subject Classification: 60K37\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet F be a random force field on Rd defined on a probability space (\u03a9\u2032 , F \u2032, P\u2032 ). The\nmotion of a particle is described by the equation\n\u1e8c(t) = F (X(t)),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere X(t) denotes the position of the particle at time t. Let V (t) = \u1e8a(t) be the velocity\nof the particle at time t. As initial conditions we take X(0) = 0 and V (0) = v0 , where v0\nis a non-random vector. The force field is assumed to be stationary and isotropic. The\nprecise form of the force field will be discussed below.\nWe shall be interested in the asymptotic behavior of X(t) and V (t) as t \u2192 \u221e. The\nprocess V (t) can be written in the integral form as\nZ t\nV (t) = v0 +\nF (X(s))ds.\n(2)\n0\n\nFormal arguments, based on the near-independence of contributions to the integral on the\nright-hand side of (2) from non-intersecting sub-intervals, suggest that V (t) behaves as a\ndiffusion process, if time is re-scaled appropriately. In fact, we shall prove that there is an\nevent \u03a9\u2032v0 in the underlying probability space \u03a9\u2032 , such that P\u2032 (\u03a9\u2032 \\ \u03a9\u2032v0 ) \u2192 0 as |v0 | \u2192 \u221e,\nand V (c3 t)/c converges, as t \u2192 \u221e, to a diffusion process on \u03a9\u2032v0 (the probability measure\n1\n\n\fon \u03a9\u2032v0 is defined by conditioning P\u2032 on the event \u03a9\u2032v0 ). In particular, the kinetic energy\nof the particle will be shown to tend to infinity as t \u2192 \u221e. The precise formulation of\nthese results will be provided in Section 3.\nWe cannot, however, expect that V (c3 t)/c converges to the diffusion process for almost\nall realizations of the force field, if v0 is fixed. Indeed, depending on the assumptions\nimposed on F , the trajectory may remain in a bounded region of space and the velocity\nmay remain bounded with positive probability.\nIt must be noted that we must exclude the case F = \u2207H, where H is a stationary\nfield, since in this case (X(t), V (t)) is a Hamiltonian flow with the Hamiltonian H(k, x) =\n|k|2 /2 \u2212 H(x), and |V (t)|2 /2 \u2212 H(X(t)) is constant on the solutions of (1).\nEarlier papers primarily studied the behavior of X(t) and V (t) on long time intervals,\nwhose length, however, depended on |v0 |, where the initial velocity v0 was treated as a\nlarge parameter. We shall assume that v0 is fixed and t tends to infinity. The trade-off\nis that we need to exclude an event of small but positive measure from the underlying\nprobability space.\nLet us mention some of the earlier results concerning the long-time behavior of X(t)\nand V (t). In [5], Kesten and Papanicolaou considered the equation\n\u1e8d(t) = \u03b5F (x(t))\n\n(3)\n\nwith the initial data x(0) = 0 and v(0) = e\nv . Certain mixing assumptions were imposed\non the force field F . It was shown that if d \u2265 3, the process v(t/\u03b52) converges weakly to a\ndiffusion process v(t) with the initial data v(0) = e\nv . The generator of the limiting\nR t process\n2\n2\ncan be written out explicitly. The process \u03b5 x(t/\u03b5 ) converges weakly to x(t) = 0 v(s)ds.\nNote that equations (1) and (3) are related via the change of variables\n\u221a\n\u221a\nv / \u03b5.\n(4)\nX(t) = x(t/ \u03b5), v0 = e\nTherefore, the convergence result for v(t/\u03b52) can be formulated in terms of V (t) as follows:\nthe process V (|v0 |3 t)/|v0 | converges to a diffusion process when v0 tends to infinity in\nsuch a way that v0 /|v0 | = ve remains fixed. Similarly, X(|v0 |3 t)/|v0 |4 converges weakly to\na limiting process.\nIn [4], Durr, Goldstein, and Lebowitz extended the convergence resultsPto the twodimensional case. The field F was assumed to be a gradient of H(x) = i h(x \u2212 pi ),\nwhere h is a smooth function with compact support, and the points pi form a Poisson\nfield on the plane. An additional difficulty in the two-dimensional case is that, unlike\nthe case with d \u2265 3, typical trajectories of (1) will self-intersect. In [7], Komorowski and\nRyzhik proved the two-dimensional result in the case when H is sufficiently mixing, but\nis not necessarily generated by a Poisson field.\nIn [6], Komorowski and Ryzhik considered the process (1) on a longer time scale.\nNamely, they demonstrated that X(|v0 |3+8\u03b1 t)/|v0 |4(1+\u03b1) converges to a Brownian motion\nfor all sufficiently small \u03b1 > 0. It was assumed that F = \u2207H, where H is sufficiently\nmixing.\n2\n\n\fUnlike the above papers, we shall consider the asymptotic behavior of V (t) when\nv0 is fixed and t \u2192 \u221e. First, however, assume that v0 \u2192 \u221e, v0 /|v0 | = ve, and let\nV (t) be the limiting process for V (|v0 |3 t)/|v0 | as v0 \u2192 \u221e. (It satisfies the stochastic\ndifferential equation (7), below.) As has been noted by Dolgopyat and De La Llave in\n[2], the process V (t) is self-similar, that is for c > 0 the process V (c3 t)/c satisfies the\nsame stochastic differential equation with initial condition V (0)/c. Therefore, for c fixed,\nV (c3 |v0 |3 t)/(c|v0 |) tends to the diffusion process (7) starting at e\nv/c. If, instead, we assume\nthat v0 is large but fixed, and take the limit as c \u2192 \u221e, we formally obtain that V (c3 t)/c\ntends to the diffusion process (7) starting at the origin. We remark that the diffusion\nprocesses satisfying the self-similarity property described above are well understood (see\ne.g. [9], Section XI). In particular the fact that this process is non-recurrent for d > 3\nplays a crucial role in our analysis.\n\n2\n\nThe Force Field\n\nLet SR,m be the space of smooth functions f : Rd \u2192 Rd which are supported inside the\nball or radius R centered at the origin and satisfy ||f ||C 2(Rd ) \u2264 m. Let \u03bc be a probability\nmeasure on SR,m . We assume that \u03bc is symmetric in the sense that if \u03c8 : SR,m \u2192 SR,m is\na mapping that maps a function f into \u2212f , then\n\u03bc(U) = \u03bc(\u03c8(U))\n\n(5)\n\nfor any measurable set U \u2286 SR,m . We also assume that \u03bc is isotropic, that is the vectors\n(O \u22121 f (Ox1), ..., O \u22121 f (Oxn )) and (f (x1 ), ..., f (xn )) have the same distribution for each\northogonal matrix O and points x1 , ..., xn \u2208 Rd . Suppose that on a probability space\n(\u03a9\u2032 , F \u2032, P\u2032 ) we have a sequence of functions fi : \u03a9\u2032 \u2192 SR,m which are independent and\nidentically distributed with distribution \u03bc. We shall consider random vector fields F of\nthe form\n\u221e\nX\nF (x) =\nfi (x \u2212 ri ),\n(6)\ni=1\n\nwhere ri form a Poisson point field with unit intensity on Rd . We assume that the\nPoisson field is independent of the sequence fi . Note that the force field F defined by (6)\nis stationary, isotropic, and has zero mean. We shall denote the j-th coordinate of the\nvector F by F j .\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nFormulation of the Main Result\n\nLet Wt be a standard d-dimensional Brownian motion. Consider the d-dimensional process\nV (t) which satisfies the diffusion equation\n!\n1\n((d \u2212 2)\u03c3 2 \u2212 (d \u2212 1)\u03bb2 )V (t)\nV (t)\ndt,\ndV (t) = q\n\u03bbdWt + (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bb) 2\n(V (t), dWt ) +\n3\n2|V\n(t)|\n|V\n(t)|\n|V (t)|\n(7)\n\nwhere\n2\n\n\u03c3 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nE(F (0)F (e1 t))dt, \u03bb =\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nE(F 2 (0)F 2 (e1 t))dt,\n\n(8)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand e1 is the first coordinate vector. It is clear that the integrals defining \u03c3 2 and \u03bb2 are\nnon-negative. We shall require that\nZ \u221e\nE(F 1 (0)F 1 (e1 t))dt > 0.\n(9)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThus, the case when F = \u2207H, where H is a stationary random field, is excluded from\nconsideration. The generator of the process V (t) is\nd\n1X \u2202\n\u2202\nL=\naij (v)\n,\n2 i,j=1 \u2202vi\n\u2202vj\n\nwhere\naij (v) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nE(F i (0)F j (vt))dt.\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nBy examining the stochastic differential equation satisfied by |V (t)|2 /2 (see formula (10)\nbelow), it is it follows that the origin is an inaccessible point for the process V (t) if d \u2265 3\n(see [9], Section XI). Therefore the solution of (7) with initial condition V (0) 6= 0 exists\nfor all t. By the solution with the initial condition V (0) = 0 we shall mean the limit in\ndistribution, as V (0) \u2192 0, of solutions with initial condition V (0). We shall prove the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 3.1. Let F be a vector field in Rd , d \u2265 4, given by (6), which satisfies (9). For\neach sufficiently large v0 there is a set \u03a9\u2032v0 such that lim|v0 |\u2192\u221e P\u2032 (\u03a9\u2032v0 ) = 1 and if \u03a9\u2032v0 is\nviewed as a probability space with the measure obtained by conditioning P \u2032 on the event\n\u03a9\u2032v0 , i.e. P\u2032v0 (A) = P\u2032 (A)/P\u2032 (\u03a9\u2032v0 ), then\n(a) the processes X(t) and V (t) tend to infinity almost surely,\n(b) the processes V (c3 t)/c on \u03a9\u2032v0 converge in distribution, as c \u2192 \u221e, to the solution\nof (7) with the initial condition V (0) = 0.\n\n4\n\n\fLet E(t) = |V (t)|2 /2 be the kinetic energy of the particle at time t, and E(t) =\n|V (t)|2 /2, where V (t) is the solution of (7) with initial condition V (0) = 0. By the Ito\nformula, E(t) is the solution of\ndE(t) = \u03c3(2E(t))\n\n1/4\n\n\u03c3 2 (d \u2212 1)\ndt\ndBt + \u221a\n2 2E(t)\n\n(10)\n\nwith the initial condition E(0) = 0, where Bt is a standard one-dimensional Brownian\nmotion. Let\nZ t\nX(t) =\nV (s)ds.\n(11)\n0\n\nWe observe that the fact that our force is Poisson and rotation invariant (rather than a\ngeneral strongly mixing force) is primarily used in subsection 6.2. An alternative approach\nwould be to estimate the rate of convergence in the averaging theorem (our Lemma 5.6)\nusing the techniques of [3] or [6] but this would make the proof much more complicated.\nTherefore in this paper to we consider the simplest possible force distribution leaving the\nextension to more general force fields as an open question.\n3/4\nRemark. Up to a change of time by a constant factor, E (t), and consequently |V (t)|3/2 ,\nare Bessel processes with dimension 2d/3. Therefore if d > 3, then from the properties\nof the Bessel processes (see Chapter 3.3.C of [8]) it follows that ln |V (t)| is a diffusion\nprocess with a positive drift, and therefore\n\u0001 1\nP |V (t)| reaches 2|v0 | before |v0 |/2 > .\n2\n\n(12)\n\nMoreover, limt\u2192\u221e |V (t)| = \u221e almost surely for d > 3. We shall also see that\nlimt\u2192\u221e |V (t)| = \u221e with high probability with respect to the measure P\u2032 if the initial\nvelocity is large (see Lemma 6.2). These properties will allow us to conclude that with\nhigh probability the trajectories of X(t) and X(t) do not \"come close\" to self-intersecting\nif the initial velocity is large (see Lemma 6.5). This avoidance of near self-intersections is\nessential to the proof of Theorem 3.1.\nTheorem 3.1 immediately implies the following.\nCorollary 3.2. Let F be a vector field in Rd , d \u2265 4, given by (6), which satisfies (9).\nFor each sufficiently large v0 there is a set \u03a9\u2032v0 such that lim|v0 |\u2192\u221e P\u2032 (\u03a9\u2032v0 ) = 1 and if \u03a9\u2032v0\nis viewed as a probability space with the measure obtained by conditioning P \u2032 on the event\n\u03a9\u2032v0 , then\n(a) the processes E(c3 t)/c2 on \u03a9\u2032v0 converge in distribution, as c \u2192 \u221e, to the solution\nof (10) with the initial condition E(0) = 0. The processes X(c3 t)/c4 on \u03a9\u2032v0 converge in\ndistribution, as c \u2192 \u221e, to the process X(t) defined by (11).\n(b) There exists a constant c\u0304 such that E(t)/c\u0304t2/3 converges in distribution to a random\nvariable with density\n\u0010 3\u0011\nd\n3\nx 2 \u22121 exp \u2212x 2 .\np(x) =\n2\u0393(d/3)\n5\n\n\fIf d = 2 or 3 then the situation is more delicate since V is recurrent. it seems that\nthe methods of the present paper can be modified to show that P (|\u1e8e (t)| \u2192 \u221e) = 0 (in\nthe more difficult case d = 2 where the trajectories of X(t) self sintersect the methods of\n[4, 7] should be used). We also beleive that Theorem 3.1(b) remains valid for d = 2, 3\n(the theorem is false if d = 1 since in that case all orbits are periodic). However we do\nnot have a proof of this since the cases of large V and small V need to be considered\nseparately and new ideas are necessary to handle the latter case.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nAuxiliary Processes\nTime Discretization\n\nLet X(t) be the solution of (1) with initial conditions X(0) = 0, V (0) = v0 . We assume\nthat the field F and, consequently, the process X(t) are defined on a probability space\n(\u03a9\u2032 , F \u2032, P\u2032 ). Assume, momentarily, that the trajectories of X(t) always \"keep exploring\"\nnew regions of Rd in the sense that for each t \u2265 0 the tail of the trajectory X(s), s \u2265 t + 1,\nis separated from the initial part of the trajectory X(s), s \u2264 t, by a distance larger than\n2R. Then, for large t, the interval [0, t] can be split into sub-intervals, such that the\ncontribution to the integral on the right-hand side of (2) from different sub-intervals are\nalmost independent. This fact will be helpful when proving that V (c3 t)/c converges to a\ndiffusion process.\nWe shall demonstrate that with high probability the trajectories of the process X(t)\nindeed have the desired property if the initial velocity is large. To this end, we shall\nconstruct an auxiliary process Y (t) on a probability space (\u03a9, F , P). The process Y (t) is\ndefined as the solution of\n\u0178 (t) = Fe(t, Y (t)), Y (0) = 0, \u1e8e (0) = v0 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Fe(t, x) can be obtained from F (x) by \"switching on\" new independent versions of\nF (x) at stopping times \u03c4n , as described below. Since the force field Fe on the right-hand\nside of (13) is time-dependent, the increments \u1e8e (\u03c4n ) \u2212 \u1e8e (\u03c4n\u22121 ) and \u1e8e (\u03c4k ) \u2212 \u1e8e (\u03c4k\u22121 ) will\nbe almost independent if |n \u2212 k| is large. This way, we don't need to be concerned about\npossible self-intersections of the process Y (t) when studying the long-time behavior of the\nprocess \u1e8e (t). Moreover, the introduction of the stopping times \u03c4n will allow us to use a\nkind of Markov property: the distribution of Y (\u03c4n + *) \u2212 Y (\u03c4n ) will depend on the events\nprior to \u03c4n only through \u1e8e (\u03c4n ) (see Section 4.2 below).\nOn the other hand, we shall prove that the processes X(t) and Y (t) will have the\nsame distribution if certain events with small probabilities are excluded from their respective probability spaces. More precisely, there are events \u03a9\u2032v0 \u2286 \u03a9\u2032 and \u03a9v0 \u2286 \u03a9 such\nthat the processes X(t, \u03c9 \u2032 )\u03c7\u03a9\u2032v0 (\u03c9 \u2032) and Y (t, \u03c9)\u03c7\u03a9v0 (\u03c9) have the same distributions. The\nprobabilities of \u03a9\u2032v0 and \u03a9v0 tend to one when |v0 | \u2192 \u221e.\n6\n\n\fBelow we give a rigorous definition of the field Fe(t, x). Roughly speaking, we follow the\ntrajectory X(t) till time \u03c41 such that there are no points ri , i \u2265 1, in the 2R-neighborhood\nof X(\u03c41 ). Then we replace the force field F by an independent version, also generated by\nPoisson points with unit intensity on Rd \\ B2R (X(\u03c41 )), but zero intensity on B2R (X(\u03c41 )),\nwhere B2R (X(\u03c41 )) is the ball of radius 2R centered at the X(\u03c41 ). We can then treat\nX(\u03c41 ) as the new initial point and define the following stopping times by induction.\nMore precisely, let i, n \u2265 1, and fin be independent identically distributed functions with\ndistribution \u03bc. Let F0 = F . Define the sequence of random fields F1 , F2 , ... as follows:\nFn (x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\nfin (x \u2212 rin ),\n\nwhere, for each n \u2265 1, rin form a Poisson point field with unit intensity on Rd \\ B2R (0) and\nzero intensity on B2R (0), and B2R (0) is the ball of radius 2R centered at the origin. The\nPoisson fields r 0 , r 1, r 2 , ... are assumed to be independent of each other and of fin (here\nr 0 = r). We can assume that the random fields Fn are defined on a probability space\n(\u03a9, F , P), which is an extension of the original probability space (\u03a9\u2032 , F \u2032 , P\u2032 ). Let \u03c40 = 0,\nFe0 = F0 , Y0 = 0, and v0 be the initial condition for the process X(t). Assuming that \u03c4n\u22121 ,\nFen\u22121 , Yn\u22121 , and vn\u22121 have been defined for some n \u2265 1, we inductively define \u03c4n , Fen , Yn ,\nand vn . Let y(t) be the solution of the equation\n\u00ff(t) = Fen\u22121 (y(t)), t \u2265 \u03c4n\u22121\n\nwith the initial conditions y(\u03c4n\u22121 ) = Yn\u22121 , \u1e8f(\u03c4n\u22121 ) = vn\u22121 . Let l = 4R + 1. Let \u03c4n be\nthe first time after \u03c4n\u22121 + l|vn\u22121 |\u22121 when there are no points rin\u22121 , i \u2265 1, within the\n2R-neighborhood of y(t) \u2212 Yn\u22121 , that is\n\u03c4n = inf{t \u2265 \u03c4n\u22121 + l|vn\u22121 |\u22121 : inf |y(t) \u2212 Yn\u22121 \u2212 rin\u22121 | \u2265 2R}.\ni\u22651\n\nIf \u03c4n = \u221e, then Yi , vi and Fei (x) are undefined for i \u2265 n. Otherwise, define Yn = y(\u03c4n ),\nvn = \u1e8f(\u03c4n ), and Fen (x) = Fn (x \u2212 Yn ).\nNow we can set Fe(t, x) = Fen\u22121 (x) for \u03c4n\u22121 \u2264 t < \u03c4n . Then the solution Y (t) of (13)\nsatisfies Y (\u03c4n ) = Yn and \u1e8e (\u03c4n ) = vn . The relation of Y (t) to the original process X(t) is\nexplained by the following lemma.\nLemma 4.1. Let Y (t) be the solution of (13) on the probability space (\u03a9, F , P). For each\nsufficiently large v0 there are events \u03a9\u2032v0 \u2286 \u03a9\u2032 and \u03a9v0 \u2286 \u03a9 with the following properties:\n(a) lim|v0 |\u2192\u221e P\u2032 (\u03a9\u2032v0 ) = lim|v0 |\u2192\u221e P(\u03a9v0 ) = 1.\n(b) The processes X(t) and Y (t) have the same distribution if restricted to the spaces\n\u03a9\u2032v0 and \u03a9v0 , respectively.\n(c) The processes \u1e8e (t) and Y (t) tend to infinity almost surely on \u03a9v0 .\n(d) If \u03a9v0 is viewed as a probability space with the measure obtained by conditioning P\non the event \u03a9v0 , then the processes \u1e8e (c3 t)/c on \u03a9v0 converge in distribution, as c \u2192 \u221e,\nto the solution of (7) with the initial condition V (0) = 0.\n7\n\n\fIt is clear that Theorem 3.1 follows from Lemma 4.1. We shall study some of the\nproperties of Y (t) in Section 5 and prove parts (a), (b) and (c) of Lemma 4.1 in Section 6.\nWe then prove part (d) of Lemma 4.1 in Section 7.\n\n4.2\n\nAnother Auxiliary Process\n\nNote that the distribution of vector field F0 is slightly different from the distribution of\nthe fields Fn , n \u2265 1. Namely, F0 is a based on a Poisson field on Rd , while Fn , n \u2265 1, are\nbased on Poisson fields on Rd \\ B2R (0).\nConsider the vector field F , which is defined in the same way as Fe, except that now\nwe assume F0 to be defined by a Poisson field with unit intensity on Rd \\ B2R (0) and zero\nintensity on B2R (0). The process Z(t) is defined as the solution of\nZ\u0308(t) = F (t, Z(t)), Z(0) = 0, \u017b(0) = w0 ,\nwhere w0 is a random vector independent of F . The reason to consider Z(t) is the following\nMarkov property.\nLet Gn be the \u03c3-algebra generated by Fei , i \u2264 n \u2212 1. For each n \u2265 1, A \u2208 B(Rd ), and\nB \u2208 B(C([0, \u221e))) we have:\nP(Y (\u03c4n + *) \u2212 Y (\u03c4n ) \u2208 B|Gn )\u03c7{\u1e8e (\u03c4n )\u2208A} = P(Z(*) \u2208 B)\u03c7{w0 \u2208A} in distribution,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the initial velocity vector w0 for the process Z(t) is assumed to be distributed\nas \u1e8e (\u03c4n ).\nIf a random variable \u03c4 is such that \u03c4 (\u03c9) \u2208 {\u03c41 (\u03c9), \u03c42 (\u03c9), ...} for each \u03c9, and the set\n{\u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4n } is Gn -measurable for each n, then from (14) it follows that\nP(Y (\u03c4 + *) \u2212 Y (\u03c4 ) \u2208 B|G)\u03c7{\u1e8e (\u03c4 )\u2208A} = P(Z(*) \u2208 B)\u03c7{w0 \u2208A} in distribution,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere G = {A \u2208 F : A \u2229 {\u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4n } \u2208 Gn for each n}.\n\n5\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we recall some results about diffusion approximation for the process \u1e8e (t)\nand provide bounds on probabilities of some unlikely events.\n\n5.1\n\nBehavior of Y (t) and \u1e8e (t) on the Time Interval [\u03c4n, \u03c4n+1]\n\nIn this subsection we shall prove that with high probability the velocity vector does not\nchange significantly between the times \u03c4n and \u03c4n+1 if |vn | is large. Therefore Y (t) can be\nwell approximated by a straight line on this time interval.\nLet zn (t) = Yn + (t \u2212 \u03c4n )vn , that is zn (t) is the solution of\nz\u0308n (t) = 0, zn (\u03c4n ) = Yn , \u017cn (\u03c4n ) = vn .\n8\n\n\fLet \u03b7n , n \u2265 1 be the first time after \u03c4n\u22121 + l|vn\u22121 |\u22121 when there are no points rin\u22121 , i \u2265 1,\nwithin the 2R-neighborhood of zn\u22121 (t) \u2212 Yn\u22121, that is\n\u03b7n = inf{t \u2265 \u03c4n\u22121 + l|vn\u22121 |\u22121 : inf |zn\u22121 (t) \u2212 Yn\u22121 \u2212 rin\u22121| \u2265 2R}.\ni\u22651\n\nLet\n\u03ben (t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\u03c4n\n\nFen (zn (s))ds,\n\n\u03b6n (t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u03c4n\n\n\u03ben (s)ds, t \u2265 \u03c4n .\n\nLet us first examine the behavior of Y (t) on the interval [0, \u03c41 ].\nLemma 5.1.

Let y(t), t \u2265 0, be the solution of the equation\n\u00ff(t) = F0 (y(t)), y(0) = 0, \u1e8f(0) = v0 ,\n\n(20)\n\nNote that Y (t) satisfies this equation on the interval [0, \u03c41 ).\nWe shall say that an event (which depends on v0 ) happens with high probability if for\neach N the probability of the complement does not exceed |v0 |\u2212N for all sufficiently large\n|v0 |. Let us show that for each \u03b4 > 0\n||F0 ||C 2 (B|v0 | (0)) \u2264 \u03b4 ln |v0 |\n\n(21)\n\nwith high probability. Recall the definition of F0 = F from Section 2, and note that\n||F0 ||C 2 (B|v0 | (0)) may be larger than \u03b4 ln |v0 | only if there is a point x \u2208 B|v0 | (0) such that\nthe ball of radius R centered at x contains at least [\u03b4 ln |v0 |]/m points out of ri , i \u2265 1.\nThe probability of this event is easily seen to decay faster than any power of |v0 | since \u03b4,\nm and R are constants and ri , i \u2265 1, form a Poisson field with unit intensity.\nTake \u22121 < \u03b1 < 0, which will be specified later, and let T0 = |v0 |\u03b1 . Let us show that\nfor each \u03b4 > 0\nsup |\u03be0 (t)| \u2264 |v0 |(\u03b1\u22121)/2+\u03b4\n(22)\n0\u2264t\u2264T0\n\n9\n\n\fwith high probability.

Their tails decay faster than exponentially since F is based\non a Poisson random field.

As discussed in the Introduction, the scale on which we see the diffusion for \u1e8b(t)\nis of order t \u223c 1/\u03b52 = |v0 |4 . Since \u1e8b(|v0 |t) = \u1e8a(t)/|v0 |, one needs time of order t \u223c |v0 |3\nto see fluctuations of order one for the process \u1e8a(t)/|v0 |.\n12\n\n\fIn this section we recall the effective equation for \u1e8e on the scale |v0 |3 and provide\nestimates for the probability that \u1e8e changes much faster or much slower than expected.\nFor a, r > 0, b > 1, and n \u2265 0, let\n\u03c4\u0302na = min{\u03c4k : \u03c4k \u2212 \u03c4n \u2265 ar 3 },\nk\u2265n\n\n\u03c4\u030cnb = min{\u03c4k : |\u1e8e (t)| \u2208\n/ (r, br) for some \u03c4n \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4k },\nk\u2265n\n\n\u03c4 n = min{\u03c4\u0302na , \u03c4\u030cnb }.\n\n(As always, the minimum over the empty set is +\u221e.) In what follows a and b will be\nfixed. The constant r will serve as a large parameter, and |v0 | will be assumed to be of\norder r. Thus \u03c4\u03020a is the first of the stopping times \u03c4k which is larger than ar 3 . Roughly\nspeaking, \u03c4\u03020a is very close to ar 3 . The stopping time \u03c4\u030c0b is, roughly speaking, the first time\nwhen |\u1e8e (t)| changes from |v0 | to either r or br (assuming that |v0 | \u2208 (r, br)).\nAssume that r is large and |v0 | \u2208 (r, br). Let us first describe the behavior of the\nprocess Y (t) on the time interval [0, \u03c4 0 ].\nLemma 5.4. For each N, \u03b4 > 0, a > 0, and b > 1, we have\n\nP\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0001\nP \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n > |vn |\u22121+\u03b4 for some n such that \u03c4n < \u03c4 0 \u2264 r \u2212N ,\n\u0013\n\u22121+\u03b4\nsup |\u1e8e (t) \u2212 vn | > |vn |\nfor some n such that \u03c4n < \u03c4 0 \u2264 r \u2212N ,\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\n\u03c4n \u2264t\u2264\u03c4n+1\n\nP (\u03c4 0 = \u221e) \u2264 r \u2212N\n\n(37)\n\nfor all sufficiently large r (i.e. for all r \u2265 r0 , where r0 depends on the distribution of the\nforce field and on N, \u03b4, a and b) and all |v0 | \u2208 (r, br).\n\u0001\nProof. For fixed n, the probability P \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n > |vn |\u22121+\u03b4 , \u03c4n < \u03c4 0 is estimated from\nabove by r \u2212N due to (16) (if n = 0) and (29) (if n \u2265 1). The number of n for which\n\u03c4n < \u03c4 0 does not exceed abr 4 . Since N was arbitrary, this implies (35). In the same way,\n(17) and (30) imply (36). Finally, (35) implies (37) again due to the fact that \u03c4n \u2265 \u03c4 0 for\nn > abr 4 .\nAs before, by considering Z(t) instead of Y (t), we obtain the following.\nCorollary 5.5. For each N, \u03b4 > 0, a > 0, and b > 1, we have\n\nP\n\n\u0001\nP \u03c4k+1 \u2212 \u03c4k > |vk |\u22121+\u03b4 for some k such that \u03c4n < \u03c4k < \u03c4 n |Gn \u2264 r \u2212N ,\n!\nsup\n\n\u03c4k \u2264t\u2264\u03c4k+1\n\n|\u1e8e (t) \u2212 vk | > |vk |\u22121+\u03b4 for some k such that \u03c4n \u2264 \u03c4k < \u03c4 n |Gn\nP (\u03c4 n = \u221e|Gn ) \u2264 r \u2212N\n\nfor all sufficiently large r almost surely on the event |vn | \u2208 (r, br).\n13\n\n\u2264 r \u2212N ,\n\n\fLemma 5.6. Assume that v0 = (|v0 |, 0, ..., 0), and |v0 | \u2192 \u221e. Then both families of\nprocesses \u1e8e (|v0 |3 t)/|v0 | and \u017b(|v0 |3 t)/|v0 | converge weakly to the diffusion process V (t)\ngiven by (7) starting at (1, 0, ..., 0).\nThis lemma is a slight modification of the results of [4, 5, 6] to the case of the processes\nY (t) and Z(t), so we omit the proof. For example, the main theorem of [5] on page 24\ngives the desired result, except the fact that in the setting of [5] there is no renewal of the\nforce field. The proof, however, goes through without major modifications.\nCorollary 5.7. For each a > 0 and b > 1 there is c < 1 such that\n\u0001\nP \u03c4\u03020a < \u03c4\u030c0b \u2264 c\n\nfor all sufficiently large r and all |v0 | \u2208 (r, br). The same is true if \u03c4\u03020a and \u03c4\u030c0b are defined\nas the stopping times for the process Z(t) with initial velocity v0 .\n\nProof. It is sufficient to consider the process Y (t) since the proof for the process Z(t)\nis completely similar. From Lemma 5.6 and the rotation-invariance of the force field it\nfollows that when |v0 | \u2192 \u221e, the processes |\u1e8e (|v0 |3 t)|/|v0 | converge weakly to the diffusion\nprocess |V (t)| with |V (0)| = 1. Therefore\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|v0 |\n3\nlim sup P\n< |\u1e8e (t)| < |v0 |b for all 0 \u2264 t \u2264 a|v0 | =\nb\n|v0 |\u2192\u221e\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n3\nlim sup P\n< |\u1e8e (|v0 | t)|/|v0 | < b for all 0 \u2264 t \u2264 a \u2264\nb\n|v0 |\u2192\u221e\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n< |V (t)| < 2b for all 0 \u2264 t \u2264 a < 1,\nP\n2b\nwhere the first inequality holds due to the weak convergence of \u1e8e (|v0 |3 t)|/|v0 | to V (t)\nsince the closure of the set {\u03c6 \u2208 C([0, a], R) : 1/b < \u03c6(t) < b for all 0 \u2264 t \u2264 a} is\ncontained in the open set {\u03c6 \u2208 C([0, a], R) : 1/2b < \u03c6(t) < 2b for all 0 \u2264 t \u2264 a}. The\nsecond inequality is due to the fact that |V (t)| is a non-degenerate diffusion process on\n(0, \u221e) starting at 1, as follows from (7) and Lemma 5.6. The Corollary now follows from\nthe definitions of \u03c4\u03020a and \u03c4\u030c0b .\nNow we can replace the stopping time \u03c4 0 by \u03c4\u030c0b in Lemma 5.4.\nLemma 5.8.

Take an arbitrary a > 0.\nThen, for |v0 | \u2208 (r, br) we have\n\u0001\nP \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n > |vn |\u22121+\u03b4 for some n such that \u03c4n < \u03c4\u030c0b \u2264\n\u0001\nP \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n > |vn |\u22121+\u03b4 for some n such that \u03c4n < \u03c4 0 +\n\u0001\nP \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n > |vn |\u22121+\u03b4 for some n such that \u03c4 0 \u2264 \u03c4n < \u03c4\u030c0b .\nThe first term in the right-hand side does not exceed r \u2212N by Lemma 5.4. In order to\nestimate the second term, we observe that\n\u0001\nP \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n > |vn |\u22121+\u03b4 for some n such that \u03c4 0 \u2264 \u03c4n < \u03c4\u030c0b =\n\u0001\nP \u03c4\u03020a < \u03c4\u030c0b and \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n > |vn |\u22121+\u03b4 for some n such that \u03c4\u03020a \u2264 \u03c4n < \u03c4\u030c0b \u2264\n\u0001\nP \u03c4\u03020a < \u03c4\u030c0b qZ ,\nwhere the inequality is due to the Markov property with respect to the stopping time \u03c4\u03020a\n(see formula (15)). Therefore, by Corollary 5.7,\nqY \u2264 r \u2212N + cqZ .\nSimilarly,\nqZ \u2264 r \u2212N + cqZ .\n\nSince c < 1 and N is arbitrary, these two inequalities imply (38). The proof of (39) is\nsimilar. In order to prove (40), define\n\u0001\nq Y (k) =\nsup\nP \u03c4\u030c0b > 2kar 3 , k \u2265 0.\nv0 :|v0 |\u2208(r,br)\n\nLet q Z (k) be defined as q Y (k), with the only difference that the stopping times are assumed\nto correspond to the process Z(t) instead of Y (t).

(41)\n\nNote that if \u03c4\u03020a , \u03c4\u030c0b > 2ar 3 , then \u03c4k+1 \u2212 \u03c4k > ar 3 for some k with \u03c4k < \u03c4 0 . Therefore, the\nfirst term on the right-hand side can be estimated from above by r \u2212N due to (35). By\nthe Markov property with respect\u0001 to the stopping time \u03c4\u03020a (see formula (15)), the second\nterm does not exceed P \u03c4\u03020a < \u03c4\u030c0b q Z (k \u2212 1) \u2264 cq Z (k \u2212 1), where c is the constant from\nCorollary 5.7.

In subsection 6.1 we establish some a priori bounds\non the growth of |\u1e8e |.\n\n19\n\n\f6.1\n\nBehavior of |\u1e8e (t)| as t \u2192 \u221e.\n\nIn this section we shall demonstrate that for large |v0 | with high probability the norm of\nthe velocity vector |\u1e8e (t)| grows as t1/3 when t \u2192 \u221e.\nThe idea of the proof is the following. We consider \u1e8e at the moments sn its modulus\ncrosses 2l (alternating odd and even l). By Lemma 5.6 and (12), ln |\u1e8e (sn )| can be well\napproximated by a simple random walk biased to the right. It follows that |\u1e8e (sn )| grows\nexponentially and so |\u1e8e (t)| spends most of the time near its maximum. By Lemma 5.6,\nsn+1 \u2212 sn is of order |\u1e8e (sn )|3 , which implies the desired result. Let us now give a detailed\nproof.\n1\nWe start by describing a discretized version of the process |\u1e8e (t)|. Let 2m\u2212 2 \u2264 |v0 | <\n1\n2m+ 2 for some m \u2208 Z. Let 0 < \u03b4 < 1. Define, inductively, a sequence of events En\u03b4 and\nthree processes sn , tn \u2208 R+ \u222a \u221e and \u03ben \u2208 Z as follows. Let E0\u03b4 = \u03a9, s0 = t0 = 0, and\n\u03b4\n\u03be0 = m. Assume that En\u22121\n, sn\u22121 , tn\u22121 , and \u03ben\u22121 have been defined for some n \u2265 1. We\nthen define\nsn = inf{t : |\u1e8e (t)| = 2\u03ben\u22121 \u22121 or |\u1e8e (t)| = 2\u03ben\u22121 +1 },\nEn\u03b4\n\n=\n\n\u03b4\nEn\u22121\n\n\u2229{\n\ntn = min{\u03c4k : \u03c4k \u2265 sn }, and \u03ben = log2 |\u1e8e (sn )|.\n\n\u2229 {tn < \u221e} \u2229 {\u03c4k+1 \u2212 \u03c4k \u2264 |vk |\u22121+\u03b4 for all k such that tn\u22121 < \u03c4k \u2264 tn }\u2229\nsup\n\n\u03c4k \u2264t\u2264\u03c4k+1\n\n|\u1e8e (t) \u2212 vk | \u2264 |vk |\u22121+\u03b4 for all k such that tn\u22121 \u2264 \u03c4k \u2264 tn }.\n\nLet Fn be the \u03c3-algebra of events determined before tn , that is Fn = \u03c3(\u222am:\u03c4m \u2264tn Gm ).\nThe process \u03ben can be viewed as a random walk (with memory and random transition\ntimes), while tn can be viewed as transition times for the random walk. Note that the\nprocess |\u1e8e (t)| takes values equal to powers of 2 at times sn . It is more convenient, however,\nto consider times tn (which are close to times sn , but coincide with the stopping times\n\u03c4k ), and the \u03c3-algebras Fn are defined using the times tn .\nThe following lemma describes the one-step transition times and transition probabilities.\nLemma 6.1. (a) En\u03b4 is Fn -measurable.

(a) The fact that En\u03b4 is Fn -measurable follows from the definition of En\u03b4 and Fn .\n\u03b4\nNext, observe that if En\u22121\nhappens, then to ensure that En\u03b4 happens we need to exclude\nthree events: {tn = \u221e}, {\u03c4k+1 \u2212 \u03c4k > |vk |\u22121+\u03b4 for some tn\u22121 \u2264 \u03c4k \u2264 tn } and\n{\n\nsup\n\u03c4k \u2264t\u2264\u03c4k+1\n\n|\u1e8e \u2212 vk | > |vk |\u22121+\u03b4 for some tn\u22121 \u2264 \u03c4k \u2264 tn }.\n\nTherefore (50) follows from Corollary 5.9 with b = 4 and r = 2m\u22121 .\n(b) The statement follows from (42) once we notice that |\u1e8e (tn\u22121 )| \u2208 (2m\u22121 , 2m+1 ) on\n\u03b4\n{\u03ben\u22121 = m} \u2229 En\u22121\nif m is sufficiently large.\n(c) This follows from Lemma 5.6 once we take into account that, by the definition of\n\u03b4\nEn\u22121\n, for n \u2265 2 and all sufficiently large m we have\n\u03b4\n||\u1e8e (tn\u22121 )| \u2212 2m | \u2264 1 on {\u03ben\u22121 = m} \u2229 En\u22121\n.\n\n(51)\n\n(d) Consider the limiting process V (t) with |V (0)| = 1. Let p be the probability that\nthe process |V (t)| reaches 2 before reaching 1/2. Notice that p > 1/2. Therefore, the\nstatement follows from Lemma 5.6 and (51).\nLemma 6.2.

First let us estimate the probability that |\u1e8e (t)| is too large. To this end, let 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264\n1/4, m be the largest integer such that 2m \u2264 at1/3 /4, and n\u2217 be the first time when \u03ben = m.\nThen (tn\u2217 +1 \u2212tn\u2217 )/ta3 is tight by Lemma 5.6, and therefore P(Dv\u03b40 \u2229{tn\u2217 +1 \u2212tn\u2217 \u2264 t}) \u2192 0\nas a \u2192 \u221e uniformly in t \u2265 1.

We\nshow that \u1e8e can not be small on whole [0, t] since this would require that \u1e8e spends a lot\nof time near 2p for some small p contradicting the transience of \u03ben .

For x, v \u2208 Rd ,\nlet K + (x, v) and K \u2212 (x, v) be the cones\n3\nK + (x, v) = {y \u2208 Rd : (y \u2212 x, v) \u2265 |y \u2212 x||v|},\n4\n3\nK \u2212 (x, v) = {y \u2208 Rd : (y \u2212 x, \u2212v) \u2265 |y \u2212 x||v|}.\n4\n\u03b4\nFrom the definition of Dv0 it easily follows that\n!\n[\n\u03b4\n\u2212\n+\nP Dv0 \u2229 ({\u03b3n * K (Yn , vn )} \u222a {\u03b3n+1 * K (Yn , vn )}) \u2264 |v0 |\u2212N\nn\n\nif |v0 | is sufficiently large.

From the definition of Dv\u03b40 it immediately follows that limt\u2192\u221e |\u1e8e (t)| = \u221e on\n\u03a9v0 . Furthermore, the trajectory Y (t) cannot have limit points in Rd , as follows from the\ndefinition of \u03a9v0 . Therefore, limt\u2192\u221e |Y (t)| = \u221e, which proves part (c) of Lemma 4.1.\nLet us now return to Lemma 6.5. From the definition of Dv\u03b40 it follows that if \u03b4 \u2032 > 0,\n\u2032\nthen \u03b3n \u2286 B(Y (\u03c4n ), vn\u03b4 ) for all n \u2265 1 if \u03b4 > 0 is sufficiently small and |v0 | is sufficiently\nlarge. Let us represent \u0393R\nn+1 as follows\nR\n\nR\n\n\u0393R\nn+1 = \u0393n+1 (\u03b4) \u222a \u0393n+1 (\u03b4),\nR\n\nwhere \u0393n+1 (\u03b4) is the R-neighborhood of \u0393n+1 (\u03b4) = {Y (t), \u03c4n+1 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4n + |vn |3\u2212\u03b4 } and\nR\n\n\u0393n+1 (\u03b4) is the R-neighborhood of \u0393n+1 (\u03b4) = {Y (t), \u03c4n + |vn |3\u2212\u03b4 \u2264 t \u2264 \u221e}.\nRecall that the constant l from the definition of the stopping time \u03c4n is equal to 4R+1.\nSince Lemma 5.10 is obviously also applicable to the process Z(t),\nP(Dv\u03b40 \u2229 {dist(K \u2212 (Yn , vn ), \u0393n+1 (\u03b4)) \u2264 3R}) \u2264 (|v0 | + n1/4 )\u22124d+12\u2212\u03b4\nR\n\nif \u03b4 > 0 is sufficiently small and |v0 | is sufficiently large. This implies (58) with \u0393n+1 (\u03b4)\ninstead of \u0393R\nn+1 .

In view of Lemma 5.10 we can assume that t > |vn |3\u2212\u03b4 . Denote e\nt = \u03c4n + |vn |3\u2212\u03b4 + t.\nLet us first explain the proof of a weaker bound: for each \u03b5 > 0 we have\n\u0001\n4\nP Dv\u03b40 \u2229 {|Y (e\nt) \u2212 x| \u2264 R\u2032 }|Gn \u2264 t\u2212 3 (d\u22122)+\u03b5 .\n(64)\n\nThis suffices for d > 4 (see the proof of Lemma 6.5). Then we explain how to improve\nthis estimate to get (63). The proof of (64) consists of two steps.\n(I) Fix \u03b51 > 0. We show that if the intersection does take place and Dv\u03b40 takes place\nthen with high probability there exists a number k such that \u03c4n + t1\u2212\u03b51 \u2264 \u03c4n+k \u2264 e\nt and\nthe following conditions are satisfied.\n(A) |Y (\u03c4n+k ) \u2212 x| \u2265 t4/3\u2212\u03b5 ,\n(B) \u03c04 \u2264 \u2220((Y (\u03c4n+k ) \u2212 x), vn+k ) \u2264 3\u03c0\n.\n4\n(II) By step (I) it suffices to show that\n\u0001\n4\n(65)\nP Y (e\nt) \u2208 B(x, R\u2032 ) and (A) and (B) hold \u2264 Constt\u2212 3 (d\u22122)+\u03b5\n26\n\n\fTo prove (65), denote r = |Y (\u03c4n+k ) \u2212 x|, let \u03a0 be the plane passing through x orthogonal\nto v0 and let P r denote the projection to \u03a0. We can find a set S = {xj } of cardinality at\nleast cr d\u22122 such that x1 = x, the balls B(xj , R\u2032 ) are disjoint, and for each j there is an\nisometry Oj leaving Y (\u03c4n+k ) and vn+k fixed and such that Oj (xj ) = x1 . By the rotation\ninvariance,\n\u0001\n1\n(66)\nP P r(Y (e\nt)) \u2208 B(x1 , R\u2032 ) \u2264\nCard(S)\nproving (65).\nThus to complete the proof of (64) it remains to justify step I. Observe that on Dv\u03b40\nwe have\n4\n|Y (\u03c4n + t1\u2212\u03b51 ) \u2212 Y (\u03c4n )| \u2264 Constt( 3 \u2212\u03b51 )(1+\u03b4)\n4\n\n|Y (e\nt) \u2212 Y (e\nt \u2212 t1\u2212\u03b51 )| \u2264 Constt( 3 \u2212\u03b51 )(1+\u03b4)\n\nOn the other hand the inequality \u2220(\u1e8e (s), (Y (s) \u2212 x)) \u2264\nwould imply\n\n\u03c0\n3\n\nfor all s \u2208 [\u03c4n + t1\u2212\u03b51 , e\nt \u2212 t1\u2212\u03b51 ]\n\n|Y (e\nt \u2212 t1\u2212\u03b51 ) \u2212 x| \u2212 |Y (\u03c4n + t1\u2212\u03b51 ) \u2212 x| \u2265 Constt4/3(1\u2212\u03b4)\n\nmaking intersection impossible if \u03b51 > 3\u03b4. Thus there exists t1 \u2208 [\u03c4n + t1\u2212\u03b51 , e\nt \u2212 t1\u2212\u03b51 ] such\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nthat \u2220(\u1e8e (t1 ), (Y (t1 ) \u2212 x)) = 3 . Next with high probability the angle changes less than 12\non [t1 , t1 + t(1\u2212\u03b51 )(3\u2212\u03b4) ]. Thus the motion on this interval is well approximated by a straight\nline and consequently there is t2 \u2208 [t1 , t1 + t(1\u2212\u03b51 )(3\u2212\u03b4) ] such that\n|Y (t2 ) \u2212 x| \u2265 Constt(1\u2212\u03b51 )(3\u2212\u03b4) t1/3\u2212\u03b4 .\n\nTaking k to be the first number such that \u03c4n+k > t2 establishes our claim.\nNow let us now indicate how to prove the lemma in full generality. We need to prove\n(65) with \u2212\u03b5 instead of \u03b5 in the right-hand side. In the arguments leading to (65) we\nonly used the projection on the plane orthogonal to vn+k . Now we consider the projection\nof the process onto the vn+k direction. During the time interval between e\nt \u2212 t1/10 and e\nt\nthe projection of \u1e8e (s) can be well-approximated by a martingale, and as such by a timechanged Brownian motion. The time-change is almost linear on this small time interval,\nand thus the projection of Y (s) is approximated well by the integral of the Brownian\nmotion. This allows us to gain an extra factor of t\u22122\u03b5 . Observe that the derivation of (66)\nonly involved rotation-invariance, and thus (66) remains valid if we replace the probability in the left-hand side by conditional probability with the condition which involves the\nprojection of the process on the direction of vn+k .\nProof of Lemma 6.5. Let\nsnk (\u03b4) = \u03c4n\u22121 + k(|vn | + n1/4 )\u22123\u03b4 , k = 0, ..., [(\u03c4n \u2212 \u03c4n\u22121 )(|vn | + n1/4 )3\u03b4 ].\n\nAs follows from the definition of Dv\u03b40 , for each R\u2032 these points form an R\u2032 -net in \u03b3n if |v0 |\nis sufficiently large. By applying (63) to xnk (\u03b4) = Y (snk (\u03b4)), we obtain that\n\u0001\nP Dv\u03b40 \u2229 {dist(Y (\u03c4n + |vn |3\u2212\u03b4 + t), \u03b3n ) \u2264 R\u2032 }|Gn \u2264\n27\n\n\f4\n\n\u2264 (|vn |3\u2212\u03b4 + t)\u2212 3 (d\u22122)\u2212\u03b5 (|vn | + n1/4 )3\u03b4\n\nholds for all sufficiently large |v0 | uniformly in n \u2265 0 and t \u2265 0. Since |\u1e8e (t)| \u2264 (|v0 | +\nt1/3 )1+\u03b4 on Dv\u03b40 , and R\u2032 was arbitrary,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR\n\u03b4\n2R\nP Dv0 \u2229 \u03b3n \u2229 \u0393n+1 (\u03b4) 6= \u2205|Gn \u2264 P Dv\u03b40 \u2229 {dist(\u0393n+1 (\u03b4), \u03b3n ) \u2264 3R}|Gn \u2264\n\u2264\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n4\n\n(|vn |3\u2212\u03b4 + t)\u2212 3 (d\u22122)\u2212\u03b5 (|vn | + n1/4 )3\u03b4 (|v0 | + (\u03c4n + |vn |3\u2212\u03b4 + t)1/3 )1+\u03b4 dt\n\n(67)\n\nholds for all sufficiently large |v0 | uniformly in n \u2265 0.

Recall that\n\n\u03c4n \u2264 (n|v0 |\u22121 + n3/4 )1+\u03b4\non Dv\u03b40 for all sufficiently large |v0 |. Since \u03b5 is fixed, these estimates imply that right-hand\nside of (67) can be made smaller than the right-hand side of (62) by taking a sufficiently\nsmall \u03b4.\n\n7\n\nThe Convergence in Distribution\n\nHere we prove Lemma 4.1(d). Recall that \u03a9v0 is given by (60).\nFor fixed v0 , let us prove that the family of processes \u1e8e (c3 t)/c is tight, when restricted\nto the event \u03a9v0 . By the Arzela-Askoli Theorem, it is sufficient to show that for each\nT, \u03b5, \u03b7 > 0 there are c0 and \u03ba > 0 such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n3\nP \u03a9v0 \u2229 {\nsup\n|\u1e8e (c t)/c \u2212 \u1e8e (c s)/c| > \u03b5} < \u03b7\n(68)\n0\u2264s\u2264t\u2264T,t\u2212s\u2264\u03ba\n\nfor c \u2265 c0 .\nLet T, \u03b5, \u03b7 > 0 be fixed. Let n\u2217 = n\u2217 (\u03ba, c) be the first time when |\u1e8e (\u03c4n )| \u2265 \u03bac. Take\n\u03ba < \u03b5/4. Define U\u03ba,c (t) = \u1e8e (\u03c4n\u2217 + c3 t)/c. By Lemma 5.6, there is \u03ba > 0 such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b5\nP \u03a9v0 \u2229 {\nsup\n|U\u03ba,c (t) \u2212 U\u03ba,c (s)| > } < \u03b7\n2\n0\u2264s\u2264t\u2264T,t\u2212s\u2264\u03ba\nfor large c. Now (68) follows easily.\nFrom Lemma 6.4, the definition of Dv\u03b40 , and the tightness established above it follows\nthat for each T, \u03b5, \u03b7 > 0 there is \u03ba > 0 such that\n!\n\u1e8e (tc3 )\nP \u03a9v0 \u2229 { sup U\u03ba,c (t) \u2212\n\u2265 \u03b5} =\nc\nt\u2208[0,T ]\n28\n\n\f\u1e8e (\u03c4n\u2217 + tc3 ) \u1e8e (tc3 )\n\u2265 \u03b5}\n\u2212\nP \u03a9v0 \u2229 { sup\nc\nc\nt\u2208[0,T ]\n\n!\n\n<\u03b7\n\nfor all sufficiently large c. Likewise, if \u03c4\u0304\u03ba is the first time when |V (\u03c4\u0304 )| = \u03ba, define\nU \u03ba (t) = V (\u03c4\u0304\u03ba + t). Then for each T, \u03b5, \u03b7 > 0 there is \u03ba > 0 such that\n!\nP\n\nsup U \u03ba (t) \u2212 V (t) \u2265 \u03b5\n\n< \u03b7.\n\nt\u2208[0,T ]\n\nFinally, from Lemma 5.6 and the definition of \u03a9v0 it follows that the distribution of U\u03ba,c ,\nconsidered over the space \u03a9v0 with the normalized measure, is close to the distribution of\nU \u03ba if c is large enough. This completes the proof of Lemma 4.1.\n\n8\n\nAppendix\n\nHere we sketch the proof of Lemma 5.3. Note that it is sufficient to prove (33), since (34)\nfollows from (33) in the same way as Corollary 5.2 follows from Lemma 5.1. We use the\nsame notations as in the proof of Lemma 5.1. It is clear that \u03b71 \u2264 T0 = |v0 |\u03b1 with high\nprobability. Therefore, due to (28) and (31) it suffices to show that\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z \u03b71\nF\u03030 (z(s0 ))ds \u03c7{max(\u03c41 ,\u03b71 )\u2264T0 } \u2264 |v0 |\u22123+\u03b4\nE\n\u03c41\n\nfor all sufficiently large |v0 |. Since F\u0303 is a Poisson field, the problem is reduced to showing\nthat for each \u03b4 > 0 one can choose \u03b1 > 0 such that\n\u0001\nE |\u03c41 \u2212 \u03b71 | \u03c7{max(\u03c41 ,\u03b71 )\u2264T0 } \u2264 |v0 |\u22123+\u03b4\nfor all sufficiently large |v0 |.
