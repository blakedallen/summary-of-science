Thus it is a purely kinematic effect.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has recently been reported by Norris et al.\n(2000a,b) that there is a relationship between\nthe peak luminosity of gamma-ray bursts (GRB)\nand the pulse time lag between BATSE energy\nchannels. Specifically, they find that the peak\nluminosity Lpk is anticorrelated with the duration of the lag, \u2206t, according to Lpk \u2248 1.3 \u00d7\n(\u2206t/0.01 sec)\u22121.15 \u00d71053 ergs/sec . This intriguing\nrelationship is useful because it probes the properties of an ensemble of bursts and thereby can\nprovide clues of the global dynamics of GRBs. It\nalso has the potential for distance estimation to\nGRBs.\nSeveral workers have attempted to explain the\norigin of the pulse lag, or so called pulse paradigm\n(Norris et al. 1996). Daigne & Mochkovitch (1998)\nwere able to produce a pulse lag by modeling the\nburst as a series of internal shocks, but obtained\ntimescales an order of magnitude too large. However, as Wu & Fenimore (2000) point out, the\nlag timescale is much longer than the synchrotron\ncooling time. Panaitescu & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (1998) modeled the kinematics of internal shocks and found\nno evidence of pulse peak lag. As of yet, the source\nof the pulse paradigm remains a mystery. This paper does not attempt to explain the origin of the\n\n2.\n\nPhoton Number Luminosity and Cosmology\n\nIn Norris et al. (2000a) a peak \u03b3-ray luminosity\nLpk was defined from the observed peak number\nflux Fpk , a luminosity distance DL derived from\nthe observed redshift z and a given cosmology, and\na mean emitted photon energy \u01eb, constant for all\nbursts:\n2\nLpk \u2261 4\u03c0\u01ebFpk DL\n.\n\n(1)\n\nHowever, one does not know the intrinsic energy\nof the photons emanating from the pulses. Therefore multiplication of all GRB fluxes by an average photon energy \u01eb, while useful to estimate\nGRB peak luminosites, obfuscates the underlying\nrelationships in the dynamics of GRBs. In other\nwords, photon number flux Fpk is the observed\nquantity and thus photon number luminosity Npk\ncan be the only calculable luminosity.\n1\n\n\fThe luminosity distance DL is defined so that\nredshift of photons is accounted for. The photon\nnumber luminosity does not depend on photon energy redshift and thus is given by\nNpk =\n\n2\n4\u03c0Fpk DL\n.\n(1 + z)\n\n(2)\n\nIn Figure 1 is shown the peak number luminosity Npk versus spectral lag \u2206t for six bursts\nwith known redshifts. I fit the data by minimizing Q2 \u2261 \u03a3(log(Npk,model ) \u2212 log(Npk,data ))2 where\nNpk,model \u2261 A(\u2206t)\u2212p . The best fit for lags CCF31\n0.1 (see Fig. 1) is\nNpk = 8.6 \u00d7 1056 \u2206t\u22120.98 photons sec\u22121\n\n(3)\n\nwith Q2 = 1.38. By comparison, a similar fit\nof Lpk from Eqn (1) versus \u2206t reproduces the\nNorris et al. (2000a) result Lpk \u221d \u2206t\u22121.15 with\nQ2 = 1.73. For CCF31 0.5, Npk \u221d \u2206t\u22120.89 with\nQ2 = 0.45 contrasts with Lpk \u221d \u2206t\u22121.03 with\nQ2 = 0.79. With six datapoints, these are small\nnumber statistics to be sure. However, the improvement in correlation Npk vs. \u2206t over that of\nLpk vs. \u2206t via reductions of Q2 by 25% or greater\nis clear.\n3.\n\nFig. 1.- Peak photon number luminosity Npk\nversus spectral pulse lag for six bursts with known\nredshifts. Spectral cross-correlation function lag\nbetween BATSE channels 3 and 1 (CCF31) for\nregions down to 0.5 and 0.1 of peak intensity were\nobtained from Norris et al. (2000a). The line of\nbest fit for 0.1 (squares) is \u221d \u2206t\u22120.98 .\n\u2206t\u2032 , possibly due to cooling or deceleration, then\nwe observe a lag\n\nRelativistic Kinematics\n\nThe relation Npk \u221d \u2206t\u22120.98 , where 0.98 is almost 1, is a strikingly simple statistical property\nfor an ensemble of GRBs to obey. In fact this relationship suggests a simple explanation. I propose\nthat this proportionality is a result of variations\nin line-of-sight relativistic velocities of GRBs.\nFor a burst expanding with Lorentz factor \u03b3 \u2261\np\n1/ 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 \u2261 v/c and at redshift z, the observed number luminosity Nobs (photons sec\u22121 )\nvaries as\nNobs =\n\n\u03b3N \u2032\n(1 + z)\n\n\u2206tobs = \u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)(1 + z)\u2206t\u2032 \u2243\n\n(1 + z)\u2206t\u2032\n2\u03b3\n(5)\n\nfor \u03b3 \u226b 1, where the angular dependence is removed by the strong effect of attenuation of number flux F received from emission moving at inclination angles greater than 1/\u03b3; F \u223c (\u03b3(1 \u2212\n\u03b2 cos \u03b8)(1 + z))\u22123 . Thus one can focus one's attention only on emitters moving directly toward\nthe observer. Combining these then yields the inverse relationship\n\n(4)\n\nNobs \u221d \u2206t\u22121\nobs .\n\n(6)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere N is the proper isotropic number luminosity for a non-expanding source. This expression\nis valid for emission that appears isotropic to the\nobserver (i.e. if the emission is in the form of a\njet, then the opening angle \u03b80 > 1/\u03b3, where 1/\u03b3\nis the relativistic beaming angle). Also, as mentioned previously, if one assumes that the spectral\npulse lag is due to some proper decay timescale\n\nThis relationship is redshift independent and thus\nis valid for luminosity Npk = (1+z)Nobs and spectral lag \u2206t = \u2206tobs /(1 + z) as would be observed\nlocal to the burst. Thus we have an explanation of\nthe relation shown in Figure 1. I propose that the\nvariety in the spectral lags and number luminosities of bursts depend solely upon the relativistic\n2\n\n\fgiven observed peak number flux and spectral lag\ns\nA\n1.5\nz\u2243\n\u22121\u2243 p\n\u22121\n2 \u2206t\n4\u03c0Fpk DA\nFpk \u2206tobs\nobs\n(10)\n\nmotion of the emitter along the line of sight. Certainly one expects variation among bursts to cause\ndeviations from this relationship, however the current data suggests this effect to be dominant.\nThere are two possibilities for the nature of this\nvariation (see Section 6). First, we are observing\nan intrinsic range of burst expansion speeds, ranging from fast bursts having little or no spectral\nlag to slower bursts having longer lags. The second possibility is that emitting material is in the\nform of a jet with some angular dependence on the\nemitter's Lorentz factor \u03b3(\u03b8) where the Lorentz\nfactor would have a peak at the centroid of the jet\n\u03b3(\u03b8 = 0) = \u03b3max and monotonically decrease on\nsome angular scale greater than 1/\u03b3 for increasing\ninclination angles \u03b8. In either case we observe only\nthe emission dominated by those emitters moving\nwith trajectories inclined within an angle 1/\u03b3 from\nour line-of-sight.\n4.\n\nwhere flux Fpk is measured in photons cm\u22122 sec\u22121\nand \u2206tobs is in seconds. It is worth noting that a\nwell determined cosmology gives a well determined\nDA (z) and thus a refined redshift z. Conversely,\nmany independently determined redshifts might\ngive cosmological information. However, the primary source of error in this relation is not the uncertainty in DA (z), but in the deviations of burst\nluminosities and lags from the relation of Eqn (9)\nas can be seen in Figure 1.\n5.\n\nIn order for there to be a lag \u2206t of the arrival of\na pulse over an energy range fixed with respect to\nthe observer (e.g. the range between BATSE channels 1 and 3) that varies inversely with Lorentz\nfactor (Eqn 5), the peak energy of the pulse must\ndecay exponentially as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\u03b3\n\u2032\n(11)\nEpk \u2243 Epk,0 \u03b3 exp \u2212\n\u03c4pk\n\nRedshift Estimation\n\nThe above discussion allows the estimation of\nredshift z from the observed peak number flux Fpk\nand the observed spectral lag \u2206\u03c4obs . Fenimore &\nRamirez-Ruiz (2000) also estimate redshifts using\nGRB variability to indicate luminosity. From Eqn\n(2) one has\n2\nNpk = 4\u03c0Fpk (1 + z)3 DA\n\n\u2032\nwhere Epk,0\nis the peak energy in the emitter\nframe, t is observer time, \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor of\nthe emitter and \u03c4pk is the proper decay timescale\nin the emitter frame. Thus we infer an exponential\ndecay law for the pulse peak energy.\nIt is important to note that this exponential\nevolution can be very rapid (. 10 msec) (Norris\net al. 1996, 2000a) and is distinct from the evolution of the pulse envelope (the so-called FRED)\nthat has been studied by many authors (e.g. Ryde\n& Svensson 2000; Liang & Kargatis 1996; Norris\net al. 1996; Fenimore & Bloom 1995).\nOne outstanding question in the study of GRB\npulses is the apparent invariance among bursts of\nthe peak energy Emx of the E 2 NE flux spectrum\n(Emx \u223c a few \u00d7100 keV) where NE is number flux\nper photon energy. One might expect this value to\nvary with burst luminosity, but it remains roughly\nconstant (to a factor of a few) over a wide variety\nof (long) GRBs.\nIf the pulse photon number flux NE (which, for\ndemonstration, we assume to be peaked at Epk )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere DA (z) is the angular diameter distance (e.g.\nHogg 1999) which is a function of the cosmology\nand redshift z, but does not vary much over the\ninterval 1 . z . 3. For example, here I follow Norris et al. (2000a) and choose (\u03a9M ,\u03a9\u039b ) = (0.3,0.7),\nfor which DA \u2248 0.4DH to within 10% over this\nrange of z, where DH \u2261 c/H0 is the Hubble Distance (choose H0 = 65 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). Also, an\nobserved spectral lag \u2206tobs varies from the local\nspectral lag \u2206t by\n\u2206t =\n\n\u2206tobs\n.\n(1 + z)\n\n(8)\n\nOne can put these components into the Npk (\u2206t)\ncurve of bursts with known redshifts\nNpk =\n\nA\n,\n\u2206t\n\nObserved Peak Pulse Energy\n\n(9)\n\nwhere A = 8.6\u00d71056 photons as taken from the fit\nin Figure 1. Thus one can estimate a redshift for a\n3\n\n\fa characteristic opening angle \u03b80 by assuming that\n\u03b3 = \u03b3max is constant for \u03b8 < \u03b80 /2 and decreases to\norder unity within a narrow boundary or \"edge\"\nregion 0 < \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 /2 < 1/\u03b3max . Thus the solid\nangle subtended by \"face\" bursts (i.e. observed\nat inclinations \u03b8 < \u03b80 /2) is \u03c0(\u03b80 /2)2 , and that for\n\"edge\" bursts is \u03c0\u03b80 /\u03b3max and the ratio is:\n\nincreases as the peak photon energy Epk of Eqn\n(11) decreases, then there will be a maximum in\n2\nEpk\nNE . This may happen as follows: the nascent\npulse emitter is extremely hot and compact. As it\nevolves, it cools (Epk drops) and it expands or becomes progressively more optically thin, releasing\nan ever increasing photon rate NE . This is analogous to early-time supernova lightcurves (Eastman et al. 1994). In this picture, uncovering the\nflux dependence NE (t, \u03b3) will give insight into why\nEmx \u2248 constant. For instance NE \u221d tln \u03b3 = \u03b3 ln t\nwith Eqn (11) demonstrates this behavior.\n6.\n\n\"edge\" bursts\n4\n.\n=\n\"face\" bursts\n\u03b3max \u03b80\n\nFrom Fig. 3 of Norris et al. (2000a), one can estimate this ratio, by defining short lags < 0.1 sec\nas \"face\" and the longer lags as \"edge\" bursts, to\nbe \u223c 2/5. Assuming \u03b3max = 100, then this gives\n5o < \u03b80 < 10o . With more statistics of the distribution of bursts along the curve of Eqn. (6) one\ncan fit the function \u03b3(\u03b8) much more precisely.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of\nthe U.S. Department of Energy by University of\nCalifornia Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract W-7405-ENG-48.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this letter I have argued that the correlation\nof Norris et al. (2000a) is between number luminosity and spectral lag and I interpret this as being\ndue to the variety, among bursts, of relativistic velocities at which emitting regions move toward the\nobserver. Suppositions as to the physical emission\nprocess have been deliberately avoided in order to\nhighlight this purely kinematic effect.\nThere are two possible scenarios by which this\nmight happen. The first is simply that the variation is due to the variation of expansion Lorentz\nfactor among bursts. From Eqn (5), this implies\nthat the ratio of maximum to minimum spectral\nlags is the same as the ratio of maximum to minumum Lorentz factors\n\u2206tmax\n\u03b3max\n=\n& 100\n\u03b3min\n\u2206tmin\n\n(13)\n\nREFERENCES\nBand D.

Thus if the fastest bursts\nhave \u03b3max \u223c 100, then the minimum bursts would\nhave \u03b3min \u223c 1 and thus may be only mildly relativistic.\nThe second possibility is that GRB ejecta is directed in a jet such that the Lorentz factor \u03b3(\u03b8)\nhas some maximum \u03b3(\u03b8 = 0) = \u03b3max and monotonically decreases with increasing angle. Thus\nthe function \u03b3(\u03b8) will determine the relative numbers of bursts observed with given spectral lags.\nBand (1997) has noted that the distribution of\nbursts is strongly peaked at small lags indicating that the Lorentz factor of emitting ejecta,\n\u03b3(\u03b8 < \u03b80 /2) \u223c \u03b3max , is basically constant over\nthe jet opening angle \u03b80 , with a fairly narrow edge\nregion \u03b8 > \u03b80 of decreasing \u03b3. Thus let us estimate\n\nThis 2-column preprint was prepared with the AAS LATEX\nmacros v5.0.\n\n4\n\n\f"}
