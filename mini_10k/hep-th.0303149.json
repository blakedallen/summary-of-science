Introduction\nQuantum Liouville theory is a crucial ingredient for a variety of models for low dimensional\nquantum gravity and non-critical string theories. In the case of two dimensional quantum\ngravity or non-critical string theories this is a consequence of the Weyl-anomaly [1], which\nforces one to take into account the quantum dynamics of the conformal factor of the twodimensional metric. More recently it was proposed that Liouville theory also plays a crucial\nrole for three-dimensional quantum gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant in the\nsense of representing a holographic dual for this theory, see e.g. [2, 3] and references therein.\nFor all these applications it is crucial that the quantum Liouville theory has a geometric\ninterpretation as describing the quantization of spaces of two-dimensional metrics. Such an\ninterpretation is to be expected due to the close connections between classical Liouville theory\nand the theory of Riemann surfaces. Having fixed a complex structure on the Riemann surface\none may represent the unique metric of negative constant curvature locally in the form ds2 =\n \u0304 = 1 e2\u03c6 . This relation between\ne2\u03c6 dzdz\u0304 where \u03c6 must solve the Liouville equation \u2202 \u2202\u03c6\n4\nthe Liouville equation and the uniformization problem leads to beautiful connections between\nclassical Liouville theory and the theory of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces [4].\nOne may therefore expect that quantum Liouville theory is related to some sort of \"quantization\" of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. A concrete proposal in this direction was\n\n\f2\n\nJ. TESCHNER\n\nmade by H. Verlinde in [7], where it was proposed that the space of conformal blocks of the Liouville theory with its mapping class group representation is isomorphic to the space of states\nobtained by quantizing the Teichm\u00fcller spaces of Riemann surfaces [8, 9, 10]. We believe\nthat understanding Verlinde's conjecture will serve as a useful starting point for developing the\ngeometrical interpretation of the quantized Liouville theory in general. The aim of the present\npaper will be to outline the definition of the objects that are involved in Verlinde's conjecture\nand to describe some key steps towards the proof of it.\n\n2. Teichm\u00fcller spaces\nThe Teichm\u00fcller spaces T(\u03a3) are the spaces of deformations of the complex structures on\nRiemann surfaces \u03a3. As there is a unique metric of constant curvature -1 associated to each\ncomplex structure one may identify the Teichm\u00fcller spaces with the spaces of deformations of\nthe metrics with constant curvature -1. Coordinates for the Teichm\u00fcller spaces can therefore\nbe obtained by considering the geodesics that are defined by the constant curvature metrics.\n2.1. Penner coordinates. - A particularly useful set of coordinates was introduced by R.\nPenner in [11]. They can be defined for Riemann surfaces that have at least one puncture. One\nmay assume having triangulated the surface by geodesics that start and end at the punctures. As\nan example we have drawn in Figure 1 a triangulation of the once-punctured torus. The length\n\nP\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nh\n\nF IGURE 1. Triangulation of the once-punctured torus.\n\nof these geodesics will be infinite. In order to regularize this divergence one may introduce one\nhorocycle around each puncture and measure only the length of the segment of a geodesic that\nlies between the horocycles. Assigning to an edge e its regularized length le gives coordinates\nfor the so-called decorated Teichm\u00fcller spaces. These are fiber spaces over the Teichm\u00fcller\nspaces which have fibers that parameterize the choices of the \"cut-offs\" as introduced by the\nhorocycles.\nA closely related set of coordinates for the Teichm\u00fcller spaces themselves was introduced\nby Fock in [8]. The coordinate ze associated to an edge e of a triangulation can be expressed\nin terms of the Penner-coordinates via ze = la + lc \u2212 lb \u2212 ld , where a, b, c and d label the other\nedges of the triangles that have e in its boundary as indicated in Figure 2.\nInstead of triangulations of the Riemann surfaces it is often convenient to consider the corresponding fat graphs, which are defined by putting a trivalent vertex into each triangle and by\n\n\fON THE RELATION BETWEEN QUANTUM LIOUVILLE THEORY AND THE QUANTIZED TEICHM\u00dcLLER SPACES 3\n\na\n\ns\n\u2745 b\n\u2745\ne \u2745s\n\ns\n\u2745\n\u2745\nd \u2745s\n\nc\n\nF IGURE 2. The labeling of the edges\n\nconnecting these vertices such that the edges of the triangulation are in one-to-one correspondence to the edges of the fat-graph.\n2.2. Symplectic structure. - The Teichm\u00fcller spaces carry a natural symplectic form,\ncalled Weil-Petersson symplectic form [12]. We are therefore dealing with a family of phasespaces, one for each topological type of the Riemann surfaces. One of the crucial virtues of\nthe Penner/Fock-coordinates is the fact that the Weil-Petersson symplectic form has a particularly simple expression in these coordinates. The corresponding Poisson-brackets are in fact\nconstant for Fock's variables ze ,\n{ze , ze\u2032 } = ne,e\u2032 ,\n\nwhere ne,e\u2032 \u2208 {\u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2}.\n\n(1)\n\n\u2032\n\nThe value of ne,e\u2032 depends on how edges e and e are imbedded into a given fat graph. If e\nand e\u2032 don't have a common vertex at their ends, or if one of e, e\u2032 starts and ends at the same\nvertex then ne,e\u2032 = 0. In the case that e and e\u2032 meet at two vertices one has ne,e\u2032 = 2 (resp.\nne,e\u2032 = \u22122) if e\u2032 is the first edge to the right(1) (resp. left) of e at both vertices, and ne,e\u2032 = 0\notherwise. In all the remaining cases ne,e\u2032 = 1 (resp. ne,e\u2032 = \u22121) if e\u2032 is the first edge to the\nright (resp. left) of e at the common vertex.\nIf one considers a surface \u03a3sg with genus g and s boundary components one will find s\ncentral elements in the Poisson-algebra defined by (1). These central elements ck , k = 1, . . . , s\nP\nare constructed as ck =\ne\u2208Ek ze , where Ek is the set of edges in the triangulation that\nemanates from the k th boundary component. The value of ck gives the geodesic length of the\nk th boundary component [8].\n2.3. Changing the triangulation. - Changing the triangulation amounts to a change of coordinates for the (decorated) Teichm\u00fcller spaces. Any two triangulations can be related to each\nother by a sequence of the following elementary moves called flips:\nr\na \u2745b\nr\ne \u2745r\n\u2745\nd\u2745r c\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nr\na \u2745b\n\u2032\nr e \u2745r\n\u2745\nd\u2745r c\n\nF IGURE 3.

These transformations generate a groupoid, the\nPtolemy groupoid [11], that may be abstractly characterized by generators and relations: One\nhas a generator \u03c9ij whenever the triangles labeled by i and j have an edge in common. The relation that characterizes the Ptolemy groupoid is called the Pentagon relation.

This means that the mapping class group MC(\u03a3) is a subgroup of the Ptolemy groupoid\nPt(\u03a3).\nIt is extremely useful to think of the algebraically complicated mapping class group MC(\u03a3)\nas being embedded into the Ptolemy groupoid.\n\n\fON THE RELATION BETWEEN QUANTUM LIOUVILLE THEORY AND THE QUANTIZED TEICHM\u00dcLLER SPACES 5\n\n3.

The representations of A(\u03a3sg ) that we are\ngoing to consider will therefore be such that the generators ck are represented as the operators of multiplication by real positive numbers lk . Geometrically one may interpret lk as the\ngeodesic length of the k th boundary component [8]. The tuple \u039b = (l1 , . . . , ls ) of lengths of\nthe boundary components will figure as a label of the representation \u03c0(\u03a3sg , \u039b) of the algebra\nA(\u03a3sg ).\nTo complete the definition of the representation \u03c0(\u03a3sg , \u039b) by operators on a Hilbert space\nH(\u03a3sg ) one just needs to find linear combinations q1 , . . . , q3g\u22123+s and p1 , . . . , p3g\u22123+s of\nthe ze that satisfy [pm , qn ] = (2\u03c0i)\u22121 \u03b4mn .

For\nthis case it is known [13] that the mapping class group is generated by the Dehn-twists along\nnonseparating(2) simple closed curves.

Controlling the possible occurrence of phase factors in\nthe relations of the mapping class group is a subtle task. An elegant formalism for handling\nthis problem was given by Kashaev in [9]. It uses an enlarged set of variables, where pairs\nof variables are associated to the 2M = 4g \u2212 4 + 2s triangles of a triangulation instead of\nits edges. The reduction to (A(\u03a3sg ), H(\u03a3sg )) can be described with the help of a simple set of\nconstraints [9]. It indeed turns out that the mapping class group is realized only projectively\n[17].\n4.

The central charge of the representations\nis given by the parameter b via c = 1 + 6Q2 , Q = b + b\u22121 , and the highest weight of the\nrepresentations V\u03b1 , V\u0304\u03b1 is parameterized as \u2206\u03b1 = \u03b1(Q \u2212 \u03b1).\nQuantum Liouville theory in genus zero is fully characterized by the set of n-point functions\nof the primary fields V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304), which are the quantized exponential functions e2\u03b1\u03c6(z,z\u0304) of the\nLiouville field. The V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304) are primary fields with conformal weights (\u2206a , \u2206a ). As usual\n[14] one may consider V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304) as the generator of a family of descendant fields V\u03b1 (v\u2297w | z, z\u0304)\nparameterized by vectors v \u2297 w \u2208 V\u03b1 \u2297 V\u0304\u03b1 .\nIn principle it should always be possible to evaluate an n-point function\nhV\u03b1s (zs , z\u0304s ) . . .

The\ncollection of lengths li of the geodesics ci furnishes a set of functions on the Teichm\u00fcller space\n\n\fON THE RELATION BETWEEN QUANTUM LIOUVILLE THEORY AND THE QUANTIZED TEICHM\u00dcLLER SPACES 13\n\nT (\u03a3sg ) that Poisson-commute with each other, {li , lj } = 0. Having half as many commuting\n\"Hamiltonians\" as dim(T(\u03a3sg )) = 6g \u2212 6 + 2s we thereby recognize the Teichm\u00fcller space as\na completely integrable system.\nA nice feature of the Fock coordinates is that they lead to a particularly simple way to express\nthe lengths l\u03b3 of simple closed curves \u03b3 in terms the variables ze . Assume given a closed path\nP\u03b3 on the fat graph homotopic to a simple closed curve \u03b3. Let the edges ei , i = 1, . . . , r be\nlabeled according to the order in which they appear on the path P\u03b3 , and define \u03c3i to be 1 if the\npath turns left(3) at the vertex that connects edges ei and ei+1 , and to be equal to \u22121 otherwise.\nThe length l\u03b3 is then computed as follows [8].\n\u0001\n2 cosh 12 l\u03b3 = |tr(X\u03b3 )| ,\n(18)\nX(\u03b3) = V\u03c3r E(zer ) . . .

The set {l1 , . . . , l3g\u22123+s ; \u03c61 , . . . \u03c63g\u22123+s } gives another set of coordinates on the\nTeichm\u00fcller space T(\u03a3sg ), the classical Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates.\nDehn twists along one of the curves ci , i = 1, . . . , 3g \u2212 3 + s do not change the pants\ndecomposition and are described by \u03c6i \u2192 \u03c6i + 2\u03c0. It seems natural to associate length-twist\ncoordinates {l1 , . . . , l3g\u22123+s ; \u03c61 , . . . \u03c63g\u22123+s } to each Moore-Seiberg graph \u0393. Changing the\nMoore-Seiberg graph \u0393 by the Dehn-twist along one of the curves ci corresponds to a change\nof the twist coordinate \u03c6i \u2192 \u03c6\u2032i = \u03c6i + 2\u03c0. The Moore-Seiberg groupoid thereby gets the\ninterpretation as the natural groupoid of canonical transformations of the length-twist coordinates.\n5.2. The length operators. - Our aim is to make contact with the Liouville conformal field\ntheory. In the Moore-Seiberg formalism for conformal field theories one considers bases for\nthe space of conformal blocks that are associated to pants decompositions of Riemann surfaces.\nOur task may be seen as a quantum counterpart of the task to construct the change of variables\nfrom the Penner- to the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates.\nLet us consider a simple closed curve c in \u03a3 such that the triangulation in an annular neighborhood of c looks as depicted in Figure 7. In this case one finds according to (18) an expression for the hyperbolic cosine of the geodesic length function that is easy to quantize,\nLc = 2 cosh 2\u03c0bp + e2\u03c0bx ,\n\n(3) w.r.t.\n\n2\u03c0bx = 21 (zb \u2212 za ),\n2\u03c0bp = 12 (za + zb ).\n\nto the orientation induced by the imbedding of the fat-graph into the surface\n\n(20)\n\n\f14\n\nJ.

Moreover, diagonalization of the length operator l\u03b3 for a closed geodesic \u03b3 \u2282 \u03a3\nleads to a factorization of \u03c0(\u03a3, \u039b) in the following sense. Let \u03a3\u2032\u03b3 \u2261 \u03a3 \\ \u03b3 be the possibly\ndisconnected Riemann surface obtained by cutting along \u03b3. The coloring \u039b of the boundary\ncomponents of \u03a3 can be naturally extended to a coloring \u039b\u2032\u03b3,l for \u03a3\u2032\u03b3 by assigning the number\nl \u2208 R+ to the two new boundary components that were created by cutting along \u03b3. The spectral\nrepresentation for l\u03b3 then yields the following representation for \u03c0(\u03a3, \u039b).\nZ \u2295\n(23)\n\u03c0(\u03a3, \u039b) \u2243\ndl \u03c0(\u03a3\u2032\u03b3 , \u039b\u2032\u03b3,l ).\nR+\n\nThe corresponding representations of the mapping class group factorize/restrict accordingly\n[20]. This allows one to construct bases (in the sense of generalized functions) for H(\u03a3)\nlabeled by the assignments of lengths to the closed geodesics c1 , . . . , c3g\u22123+s that define a\npants decomposition.\n\n6.

Considering punctures (holes of zero size) corresponds\nto setting s2 = 0 = s1 . The expression for the generator of the B-move that was found in [18]\nmay be written as\nR = e\u03c0ip2 p1\n\nsb (p2 ) \u03c0ip2 p1\nsb (p1 ) \u22121\n.\ne (q1 \u2212 q2 )\ne\nsb (p2 ) b\nsb (p1 )\n\n(34)\n\nAs already observed in [18], R is identical to the R-operator for the modular double\nDUq (sl(2, R)) of Uq (sl(2, R)) that was first proposed in [24] and further studied in [25].\nBy working out the operator L21 that represents the length of the geodesic surrounding the\ntwo punctures via L21 = 2 cosh 21 l21 , one finds that L21 coincides with the realization of the\nCasimir C21 of DUq (sl(2, R)) in the tensor product of two of its representations.\nThese observations may then be used in order to find the operator Rs2 s1 that represents the\nbraiding of two holes with finite circumferences lk = (4\u03c0b)\u22121 sk . In order to do this one\nmay \"fill\" the holes by gluing disks with two punctures each to the boundaries of the holes.\n\n\fON THE RELATION BETWEEN QUANTUM LIOUVILLE THEORY AND THE QUANTIZED TEICHM\u00dcLLER SPACES 17\n\nThe braiding of the two holes can be decomposed into a sequence of braidings of the four\npunctures. By using [25] (Theorem 3) it is then possible to show that\nRs2 s1 = e\u03c0ip2 p1\n\nsb (p1 \u2212 s1 ) \u22121\nsb (p2 + s2 ) \u03c0ip2 p1\n.\ne (q1 \u2212 q2 )\ne\nsb (p2 + s2 ) b\nsb (p1 \u2212 s1 )\n\n(35)\n\nIt remains to observe that according to [25] (Theorem 6) the operator Rs2 s1 becomes diagonal\non eigenstates of the length operator L21 . The eigenvalue of Rs2 s1 is\nQ2 \u0010 l \u00112\n.\n(36)\n+\nB T (l3 , l2 , l1 ) = e\u03c0i(\u2206l3 \u2212\u2206l2 \u2212\u2206l1 ) ,\n\u2206l =\n4\n4\u03c0b\n\n6.3. S-move. - One possibility to introduce the operator that represents the S-move is to\nconsider the change of basis between bases that diagonalize the length operators of a- and bcycles on the once-holed torus respectively. The proof that the operators that represent the\nA-, B- and S-moves satisfy the relations of the Moore-Seiberg groupoid [15, 16] will be given\nin [20]. Concerning the relations coming from genus zero surfaces we may observe that their\nvalidity immediately follows if one combines the above observations concerning relations with\nDUq (sl(2, R)) with the results of [22, 25].\nIt furthermore turns out that the kernel that represents the S-move can be expressed in terms\nof (F T , B T ) by means of an expression which is similar to the one that was found for rational\nconformal field theories in [26]. The data (F T , B T ) are therefore sufficient to characterize the\nprojective representation of the Moore-Seiberg groupoid on the quantized Teichm\u00fcller spaces\nHgs completely.\n\n6.4. The Verlinde conjecture. - The main observation to be made is the following. One\nhas\nlk\nQ\n+i\n.\n(37)\n(F T , B T ) \u2261 (F L , B L ) provided that ak =\n2\n4\u03c0b\nIt follows that the spaces of conformal blocks of Liouville theory and the Hilbert spaces from\nthe quantization of the Teichm\u00fcller spaces are indeed isomorphic as representations of the\nmapping class group.\n7. Final remarks\nFirst let us note that so far the conformal blocks of Liouville theory were only constructed\nin genus zero, but our results imply that the corresponding mapping class group representation\nhas a consistent and essentially unique extension to higher genus.\nOne may wonder if there is a more direct relation between the conformal blocks of Liouville\ntheory as discussed in Section 4 and the eigenfunctions of the length operators from Sections\n5 and 6. In this regard one may observe that so far the quantization of the Teichm\u00fcller spaces\nT(\u03a3) was based on the choice of a real polarization for T(\u03a3). However, the complex structure\non the Teichm\u00fcller spaces T(\u03a3) should allow one to introduce an alternative (\"coherent state\")\nrepresentation where the states are represented by wave-functions that are analytic on T(\u03a3).\nSuch a representation should have the property that the action of the mapping class group\n\n\f18\n\nJ. TESCHNER\n\na\n\nF IGURE 12. Relation between the parameter a and the \"shape\" of the boundary.\n\n(the symmetry group of our phase-space) is represented by monodromy transformations. The\nfield theoretical conformal blocks have exactly this property. This leads us to suggest that the\nLiouville conformal blocks are in fact just representing the change of basis from a coherent\nstate basis for H(\u03a3) to a basis in which the length operators are diagonal.\nOur results finally establish a precise correspondence (37) between the labels ak = Q\n2 + iP\nof a Liouville vertex operator Va and the length lk of the hole to which Va is associated.\nThe fact that all the basic objects are meromorphic w.r.t. the variables ak or lk allows one to\nanalytically continue from the case considered above to cases where ak \u2208 R. The geometrical\ninterpretation of the cases ak \u2208 R was previously inferred from the semi-classical relation\nbetween a and the type of singularity that the metric ds = e2\u03c6 dzdz\u0304 develops near the insertion\npoint of Va , see e.g. [27]. Combining these two observations gives the diagram drawn in\nFigure 12, which relates the parameter a to the \"shape\" of the boundary component to which\nVa is associated. It is remarkable and nontrivial that the point a = 0 indeed corresponds to the\ncomplete disappearance of a boundary component, as follows from [23] (Appendix B.1).\nThe author would like to thank the organizers of the 6th International\nAcknowledgments\nConference on CFTs and Integrable Models, Chernogolovka, for organizing a nice and stimulating conference.
