Introduction\nStellar core collapse occurs towards the end of the evolution of massive stars when\ntheir iron cores grow beyond the critical mass supportable by the pressure of a nearly\ndegenerate electron gas. The ensuing gravitational collapse of the inner core is an\nextreme example for the conversion of binding energy into (neutrino-)radiation [1]:\nThe transition of the inner core of the supernova progenitor star to a compact neutron\nstar makes an energy of few times 1053 erg available for the emission of neutrinos.\nThis energy corresponds to a mass defect of the remnant \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 ! The first (and\nso far only) detection of supernova neutrinos from SN1987A (summarised e.g. in\n[2]) recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. The detection of supernova neutrinos\nprovides the most direct observational evidence for the link of a collapsing stellar core\nto a supernova explosion.\nComputer models with spectral neutrino transport seem to agree on the general\nscenario of a delayed explosion (see [2] and references therein) in which we distinguish\nfour different phases. During the collapse phase, the stellar core splits into a\nhomologously collapsing subsonic inner core and the outer layers, which accrete with\n\n\fNuclear physics with spherically symmetric supernova models\n\n2\n\nsupersonic infall velocities in the wake of the homologous collapse. The matter has an\nentropy \u223c 1 kB /baryon and consists of heavy, neutron-rich nuclei. Electron captures\nand neutrino emission under these conditions are essential to determine the evolution\nof the electron fraction through collapse and the strength of the core rebounce in\nthe bounce phase, which occurs when nuclear saturation density is exceeded at the\ncenter. Once nuclear density is reached the low compressibility of matter produces\na stagnation wave traveling to the edge of the homologous core, where it faces the\nsupersonic accretion. The wave turns into a shock which heats and dissociates the\naccreting matter. The sudden appearance of free protons in a neutrino-transparent\nregime leads to the emission of an energetic neutronization burst of electron neutrinos\nwithin 2 \u2212 5 ms after bounce. This concludes the bounce phase. The dynamic shock\nturns into a hydrostatically expanding accretion front, which, throughout the ensuing\naccretion phase, delimits the cold accretion flow from the hot dissociated matter piling\nup on the newborn protoneutron star (PNS). The fourth phase is the explosion phase,\nwhere a part of the hot accumulated matter drives the shock to larger radii into the\nouter layers, leading to a supernova explosion and the ejection of matter. Another\npart of the accumulated matter sinks onto the PNS or fills the space between PNS\nand ejecta in the form of a neutrino-driven wind. The explosion phase is thought to\ndevelop after an accretion phase lasting 500 ms or more, which is of order hundred\ntimes longer than the hydrodynamic bounce phase.\nHowever, the obstinate difficulty to reproduce explosions in spherically symmetric\nmodels of core collapse and postbounce evolution stimulated the consideration of\nnumerous modifications and alternatives to this basic scenario, mostly relying on\nmulti-dimensional effects that could not be treated in spherical symmetry. To name\nonly a few: It was discussed whether convection in the PNS could accelerate the\ndeleptonisation and increase the neutrino luminosity [3]. The convective overturn\nbetween the PNS and shock front was shown to increase the efficiency of neutrino\nenergy deposition [4]. Asymmetric instabilities of the standing accretion shock [5, 6]\nmay help to push the shock to larger radii and g-mode oscillations of the PNS may\ncontribute to neutrino heating by the dissipation of sound waves beween the PNS and\nthe shock [7]. Moreover, it has been suggested that magnetic fields have an impact\non the explosion mechanism (see e.g. [8]). Most of above-mentioned modifications of\nthe explosion mechanism are essentially of a three-dimensional nature. In order to\nillustrate the complexity of the crucial accretion phase we show in Figure 1 a slice\nthrough a three-dimensional simulation of core collapse and postbounce evolution of\na run described in more detail in [9]. Its input physics uses the Lattimer-Swesty\nequation of state [10] and a parameterisation of the neutrino physics for the collapse\nphase [11]. The treatment of neutrino cooling and heating in the postbounce phase is\nunder development based on multi-group diffusion, but has not yet been successfully\napplied in this high-resolution run with 6003 zones.\nInitially, spherically symmetric supernova models were the most realistic among\nall feasible computer representations of the event. With increasing observational\nevidence for the complexity of the explosions (e.g. [12]) their primary purpose\nshifted from a realistic representation to the identification and understanding of the\nbasic principles of the explosion mechanism. After the emergence of axisymmetric\nsimulations with sophisticated and computationally intensive spectral neutrino\ntransport [13, 14] spherically symmetric models still have several assets. In the\nfollowing we describe selected applications of spherically symmetric models related\nto nuclear and weak interaction input physics.\n\n\fNuclear physics with spherically symmetric supernova models\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.\nIllustration of the early accretion phase in a three-dimensional\nsimulation with parameterized neutrino physics [9]. Density contours are drawn\nas black lines. The colour on the left hand side indicates the specific entropy and\nthe cones the direction of the velocity. The colour on the right hand side refers to\nthe magnetic field strength and the cones to its direction. The cool high-density\ninterior of the PNS and the hot low-density accreted matter behind the standing\naccretion front are clearly distinguishable.\n\n2. Conditions obtained with GR spectral neutrino transport\nThe complete general relativistic (GR) Boltzmann equation for neutrino transport has\nso far only been solved in spherically symmetric dynamical simulations [15, 16, 17].\nSome of the GR effects have less effect on the explosion mechanism (e.g. the bending\nof neutrino trajectories by the PNS) than others (e.g. the GR effects included in the\nhydrostatic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation). Hence, accurate results can be\nobtained by the careful design of approximations [18]. But spherically symmetric\nsimulations are not only useful as a testbed for approximations and comparisons\n[19], they can also provide a clearly arranged foundation to determine the conditions\nachieved in supernova simulations and to distinguish and study the input physics\nin different regimes. Figure 2 shows an overview of the conditions achieved in a\nsimulation of the collapse, bounce, and explosion of a 20 M\u2299 star (model B05 in\n[20]). Figure 2a shows that the four phases of the supernova scenario involve quite\ndistinct regimes of conditions. The conditions can be subdivided into three different\nregimes: The lower dark branch reaching from low densities up to nuclear density\ncorresponds to cold infalling matter containing heavy ions. Its electron fraction in\nFigure 2b follows during infall the dark branch reaching from Ye = 0.5 to Ye \u223c 0.3.\n\n\fNuclear physics with spherically symmetric supernova models\n\n4\n\nFigure 2. Overview of the conditions achieved in a simulation of the collapse,\nbounce, and explosion (artificially induced) of a 20 M\u2299 star. Shown are two\nhistograms of the occurence of conditions as function of density \u03c1, specific\nentropyR s and \u0001electron fraction Ye . The shading of a given bin corresponds to\nlog10\ndm dt in arbitrary units, where the integral over mass is performed over\nthe mass dm of matter whose thermodynamic state at a given time falls into the\nbin. The integral over time extends over the duration of a simulation. Hence,\nregions of dark shading correspond to states that are assumed by considerable\nmass for an extended time, while light or absent shading corresponds to conditions\nthat are rarely assumed in the supernova simulation. The vertical black line\nindicates nuclear density. The horizontal black line indicates an entropy of 3\nkB /baryon beyond which ions are dissociated. In Figure 2a, it clearly separates\nthe conditions of cold infalling matter on the lower branch from the conditions of\nhot shocked matter on the upper branch.\n\nThe matter beyond the nuclear density threshold in Figure 2a corresponds to bulk\nnuclear matter in the interior of the PNS. As one can see from Figure 2b it does not\nsignificantly deleptonize during the simulation because of the short mean free paths\nand correspondingly long diffusion times of the neutrinos at high density. As soon as\ninfalling matter is hit by the accretion shock, its entropy jumps to the upper edge of\nthe upper branch while its Ye drops by enhanced electron capture in the dissociated\nregime. The darker tinted cloud around the density of 1010 g/cm3 reaches entropies\nbetween 10 and 30 kB /baryon by neutrino heating between the PNS and the standing\naccretion shock. The lighter tinted region toward lower densities and higher entropies\nindicates conditions during matter ejection. In Figure 2b part of the ejected matter\nassumes conditions with Ye > 0.5 as we will discuss later.\n3. Sensitivity of models to input physics changes\nThe exchange of lepton number and energy in the models is given by weak interaction\nrates between different neutrino flavours and matter. The latter is assumed to be in\nthermodynamic and nuclear statistical equilibrium except for the infalling outer layers\nand expanding ejecta. The effective weak interaction rates increase with increasing\nbaryon density until the opacity reaches a level where the neutrinos diffuse away more\nslowly than they are produced. The rates then become Pauli-blocked. Hence there\nis a range of maximum importance of the weak interaction rates at densities around\nthe neutrinospheres (\u223c 1010 \u2212 1012 g/cm3 ). The intersection of this density range\n(dashed box) with the two branches identified in Figure 2a leads to two important\n\n\fNuclear physics with spherically symmetric supernova models\n\n5\n\nregimes for weak interactions: The conditions on the lower branch at (s \u223c 1, Ye \u223c 0.35)\nassumed in infalling layers during collapse, and the conditions on the upper branch at\n(s \u223c 10, Ye \u223c 0.1) assumed in the hot mantle of the PNS during the accretion phase.\nTraditional treatments of the weak interaction rates in supernova simulations [21]\nrecently received updates in both regimes. It was recognized that electron captures\non nuclei (and not protons) provide the dominant deleptonization mechanism during\ncollapse, even if the corresponding Gamov-Teller transitions seem forbidden in the\noversimplified independent particle model of the increasingly neutron-rich nuclei [22].\nThe new rates lead to a smaller homologous core and to a lower initial shock energy\nat bounce [23]. On the other hand, weak magnetism corrections in the hot dissociated\nmatter on the upper branch of Figure 2a have been added to zeroth-order cross sections\n[24]. This results in a slightly different balance between neutrinos and antineutrinos\nin the accretion phase for all three neutrino flavours [25].\nThe equation of state (EoS) is the second nuclear physics pillar of supernova\nsimulations. It has to define composition and thermodynamic quantities as a function\nof density, entropy, and electron fraction over a wide range of conditions. Firstly, the\nEoS can directly influence the dynamics. A higher compressibility of matter at bounce,\nfor example, leads to a larger initial shock energy [26]. Secondly, the composition\nis another important path for the EoS to affect the simulations. A composition\nwith a high fraction of nuclei with large electron capture rates will lead to faster\ndeleptonization than a composition with nuclei that forbid electron captures. Or, later\nin the accretion phase, a large fraction of alpha particles in the heating region will\ndecrease the heating efficiency because they can not absorb neutrinos as efficiently\nas free nucleons. Thirdly, the EoS influences the simulations by the geometric\narrangement of its consistutents. During collapse, the ions in the low-entropy matter\nare spatially correlated and coherence effects should be considered in the calculation\nof neutrino opacities ([27] and references therein). The phase transition from isolated\nnuclei to bulk nuclear matter is expected to involve complicated clustering of baryons\nthat might affect neutrino opacities as well [28, 29, 30].\nFinally, the EoS determines the simulation results by the macroscopic structure of\nthe PNS in hydrostatic equilibrium. Even if the high opacity prevents the high-density\nregime of the PNS from affecting the simulations directly by neutrino transport, it\nis the compactness of the proto-neutron star which determines the positions of the\nneutrinospheres in the gravitational potential. The positions of the neutrinospheres\nhave clearly visible consequences for the neutrino luminosity and spectrum. This\nbecame evident in simulations investigating GR effects [31, 16] as well as in simulations\ncomparing different EoS's [32, 17].\n4. Neutrino emission\nThe neutrino signal during collapse and the energetic neutronization burst few\nmilliseconds after bounce are surprisingly similar for progenitor stars of 13 M\u2299\nto 40 M\u2299 . This is due to a similar size of the collapsing core at the point of\ngravitational instability and to negative feedback in the net deleptonization rate before\nneutrino trapping [25]. The neutrino luminosities during the accretion phase are more\nprogenitor dependent. The diffusion of neutrinos out of the cooling PNS provides the\ndominant contribution to the \u03bc- and \u03c4 -neutrino signal. An additional contribution\n(of about equal size) to the electron flavour neutrino luminosities stems from the\ncompression of the hot accreted matter settling on the surface of the PNS.

The solid,\ndashed and dash-dotted lines refer to electron neutrinos, electron antineutrinos\nand heavy neutrinos respectively. The values are given at 200 km radius in the\nframe comoving with the fluid.\n\ncontribution depends strongly on the accretion rate.\nFigure 3a shows the time evolution of the neutrino luminosities for two different\nprogenitor stars after the decay of the neutronization burst. The thin lines correspond\nto an extension of model G15 [19]. While the luminosities of the heavy neutrinos\n(dash-dotted line) show a progressively cooling PNS, the electron flavor neutrinos\n(solid and dashed lines) reveal a significant drop in the accretion rate around 200 ms\nafter bounce before they level off to an extended stationary accretion phase. This\nbehaviour is expected for a PNS that does not compress significantly because it is\nquite far from reaching its maximum stable mass. Since \u03bc- and \u03c4 -neutrino producing\nlayers in the PNS cool faster than they are compressionally heated, the rms energies\nof the heavy neutrinos fall below the rms energies of the electron flavour neutrinos,\nwhich stem from the continued accretion of hot matter. The accretion rate would\nsuddenly drop at the time of an eventual explosion (not obtained in this run). The\nelectron flavour neutrino luminosities would then suddenly decay and asymptote to\nthe level of the heavy neutrino luminosities of the cooling PNS.\nA different scenario occurs for a 40 M\u2299 progenitor star [34] whose luminosities\nin the postbounce evolution are also displayed in Figure 3a (thick lines). We also see\nthe decreasing accretion rate reflected in the electron flavour neutrino emission (solid\nand dashed lines), but the heavy neutrino luminosities go through a minimum and\nraise again (dash-dotted line). This is due to the hydrostatic compactification of the\nPNS as it approaches the maximum stable mass determined by the high-density EoS.\nHot accreted matter is compressed to densities where the main \u03bc- and \u03c4 -neutrino\nproduction takes place so that their luminosities increase [35, 36, 37]. We want to\nemphasize with this comparison that large differences in the neutrino luminosities\n(and spectra) in models for different explosion scenarios and launched from different\nprogenitor models do not just classify as 'uncertainties', they reflect various dynamical\nprocesses at the center of a collapsed star, like the exact time of core-bounce, the\nevolution of the accretion rate, the compressibility of the PNS, the formation of a\nblack hole, or the onset of the supernova explosion.\nBefore the neutrino signal reaches a terrestrial observer, one has to account for\n\n\fNuclear physics with spherically symmetric supernova models\n\n7\n\nneutrino flavour transformations. Of special interest for the neutrino heating after the\nonset of the explosion are possible collective modes [38, 39].\n5. Spherical ejection models and nucleosynthesis\nSupernova nucleosynthesis predictions traditionally rely on artificially induced\nexplosions, replacing the central engine either with a parameterized kinetic energy\npiston or a thermal bomb. The explosion energy and the placement of the mass cut\n(separating ejected matter from matter which is assumed to fall back onto the neutron\nstar) are tuned to recover the observed explosion energy and ejected 56 Ni mass. Both\napproaches are largely compatible [40] and justifiable for the outer stellar regions, but\nmost of the Fe-group nuclei are produced in the inner regions which are most affected\nby the details of the explosion mechanism. The electron fraction Ye is an indispensable\nquantity for the description of the explosive nucleosynthesis in the innermost ejecta. It\nis set by weak interactions in the explosively burning layers, i.e. electron and positron\ncapture, beta-decays, and neutrino or anti-neutrino captures.\nWe examined the effects of both electron and neutrino captures in the context of\nspherically symmetric simulations with Boltzmann neutrino transport [20]. In order\nto provoke the ejection of matter in spherically symmetric models, we had to modify\nthe simulations in the accretion phase. Having PNS convection [3] or convective\nturnover [4] in mind, we artificially enhanced the neutrino emission from the PNS\nor, alternatively, the neutrino absorption efficiency in the hot mantle surrounding\nit. Both approaches serve as matter ejection models with a consistently emerging\nmass cut. Similar simulations using tracer particles from two-dimensional simulations\n[13] have been performed in [41]. Also in this case, artificial adjustments to the\nsimulations were needed to remedy the failure of the underlying models to produce\nself-consistent explosions. Also in both cases, the neutrino transport could not be\nrun to later times and the simulations were mapped to a simpler model to continue\nthe simulation. Despite these shortcomings, these simulations reveal the significant\nimpact of neutrino interactions on the composition of the ejecta. At early times, the\ninner ejecta are electron-degenerate and electron capture dominates. Due to neutrino\nheating in the heating region and the expansion this degeneracy is lifted and electronemitting neutrino absorption reactions start to dominate the change of Ye . Eventually\nthe electron chemical potential drops below the mass difference between the neutron\nand proton. At this energy scale, the proton is favored because of its slightly larger\nbinding energy. We found that all our simulations that lead to an explosion by neutrino\nheating developed a proton-rich environment around the mass cut with Ye > 0.5 [20].\nThe nucleosynthesis in proton-rich ejecta has been investigated in [42, 43, 41].\nThe global effect of the proton-richness is the removal of previously documented\noverabundances of neutron rich iron peak nuclei [33, 44]. Production of 58,62 Ni\nis suppressed while 45 Sc and 49 Ti are enhanced. The results for the elemental\nabundances of scandium, cobalt, copper, and zinc are closer to those obtained by\nobservation [20]. However, the neutrino interactions are not only responsible for the\nproton-richness of the environment, they also transform protons into neutrons by\nantineutrino capture so that (n,p)-reactions substitute for the slow \u03b2-decays in the\nwaiting point nuclei, allowing significant flow to A > 64 by the \u03bdp-process [45]. This\nprocess turns out to have a significant impact on the nucleosynthesis in the early\nneutrino wind [46, 47].\n\n\fNuclear physics with spherically symmetric supernova models\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by grants No. PP002-106627/1, No. 200020-105328/1\nand No. IB7320-110996/1 from the Swiss National Science Foundation and the EU\nprogram ILIAS N6 ENTApP WP1.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n[43]\n[44]\n[45]\n[46]\n[47]\n\nBaade W and Zwicky F 1934 Proceedings of the National Academy of Science 20 259\u201363\nBethe H A 1990 Rev.
