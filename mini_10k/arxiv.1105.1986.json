Here we consider L as projective collineation group with right\nactions in homogeneous coordinates. We will use the Cartesian homogeneous\ncoordinate simplex E0 (e0 )E1\u221e (e1 )E2\u221e (e2 ) E3\u221e (e3 ), ({ei } \u2282 V4 with the unit\npoint E(e = e0 + e1 + e2 + e3 )) which is distinguished by an origin E0 and by the\nideal points of coordinate axes, respectively. Moreover, y = cx with 0 < c \u2208 R\n(or c \u2208 R \\ {0}) defines a point (x) = (y) of the projective 3-sphere PS 3 (or\nthat of the projective space P 3 where opposite rays (x) and (\u2212x) are identified).\nThe dual system {(ei )}, ({ei } \u2282 V 4 ) describes the simplex planes, especially\nthe plane at infinity (e0 ) = E1\u221e E2\u221e E3\u221e , and generally, v = u 1c defines a plane\n(u) = (v) of PS 3 (or that of P 3 ). Thus 0 = xu = yv defines the incidence of\npoint (x) = (y) and plane (u) = (v), as (x)I(u) also denotes it. Thus Nil can be\nvisualized in the affine 3-space A3 (so in E3 ) as well.\n\n\fOn lattice coverings of Nil space by congruent geodesic balls\n\n3\n\nThe translation group L defined by formula (1.3) can be extended to a larger\ngroup G of collineations, preserving the fibering, that will be equivalent to the\n(orientation preserving) isometry group of Nil.\nIn [2] E. Moln\u00e1r has shown that a rotation trough angle \u03c9 about the z-axis at\nthe origin, as isometry of Nil, keeping invariant the Riemann metric everywhere,\nwill be a quadratic mapping in x, y to z-image z as follows:\nR = r(O, \u03c9) : (1; x, y, z) \u2192 (1; x, y, z);\nx = x cos \u03c9 \u2212 y sin \u03c9, y = x sin \u03c9 + y cos \u03c9,\n1\n1\n1\nz = z \u2212 xy + (x2 \u2212 y 2 ) sin 2\u03c9 + xy cos 2\u03c9.\n2\n4\n2\n\n(1.4)\n\nThis rotation formula R, however, is conjugate by the quadratic mapping M to\nthe linear rotation \u03a9 in (1.5) as follows\n1\nM\nM : (1; x, y, z) \u2212\u2192 (1; x\u2032 , y \u2032, z \u2032 ) = (1; x, y, z \u2212 xy) to\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec0 cos \u03c9 sin \u03c9 0\uf8f7\n\u03a9\n\uf8f7\n\u03a9 : (1; x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 (1; x\", y\", z\") = (1; x\u2032 , y \u2032, z \u2032 ) \uf8ec\n\uf8ed0 \u2212 sin \u03c9 cos \u03c9 0\uf8f8 ,\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\nM\u22121\nwith M\u22121 : (1; x\", y\", z\") \u2212\u2192 (1; x, y, z) = (1; x\", y\", z\" + x\"y\").\n2\n(1.5)\nThis quadratic conjugacy modifies the Nil translations in (1.1), as well. Now a\ntranslation with (X, Y, Z) in (1.3) instead of (x, y, z) will be changed by the above\nconjugacy to the translation\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 X Y Z \u2212 12 XY\n\uf8ec0 1 0\n\u2212 12 Y \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n(1; x, y, z) \u2212\u2192 (1; x, y, z) = (1; x, y, z) \uf8ec\n(1.6)\n1\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed0 0 1\nY\n2\n0 0 0\n1\nthat is again an affine collineation. We shall use the following important classification theorem.\nTheorem 1.1 (E. Moln\u00e1r [2]) (1) Any group of Nil isometries, containing a 3dimensional translation lattice, is conjugate by the quadratic mapping in (1.5) to\nan affine group of the affine (or Euclidean) space A3 = E3 whose projection onto\nthe (x,y) plane is an isometry group of E2 . Such an affine group preserves a plane\n\n\f4\n\nJen\u0151 Szirmai\n\n\u2192 point polarity of signature (0, 0, \u00b10, +).\n(2) Of course, the involutive line reflection about the y axis\n(1; x, y, z) \u2192 (1; \u2212x, y, \u2212z),\npreserving the Riemann metric, and its conjugates by the above isometries in (1)\n(those of the identity component) are also Nil-isometries. Orientation reversing\nNil-isometry does not exist.\nThe geodesic curves of the Nil geometry are generally defined as having locally minimal arc length between their any two (near enough) points. The equation\nsystems of the parametrized geodesic curves g(x(t), y(t), z(t)) in our model can\nbe determined by the general theory of Riemann geometry: We can assume, that\nthe starting point of a geodesic curve is the origin because we can transform a\ncurve into an arbitrary starting point by translation (1.1);\nx(0) = y(0) = z(0) = 0; \u1e8b(0) = c cos \u03b1, \u1e8f(0) = c sin \u03b1,\n\u017c(0) = w; \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0.\nThe arc length parameter s is introduced by\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\ns = c2 + w 2 * t, where w = sin \u03b8, c = cos \u03b8, \u2212 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 ,\n2\n2\ni.e. unit velocity can be assumed.\nRemark 1.1 Thus we have harmonized the scales along the coordinate axes.\nThe equation systems of a helix-like geodesic curves g(x(t), y(t), z(t)) if 0 <\n|w| < 1:\n\u0010 wt\n\u0011\n\u0010 wt\n\u0011\n2c\nwt\n2c\nwt\nx(t) =\nsin\ncos\n+ \u03b1 , y(t) =\nsin\nsin\n+\u03b1 ,\nw\n2\n2\nw\n2\n2\nn\n2 h\u0010\nsin(2wt + 2\u03b1) \u2212 sin 2\u03b1 \u0011\nc\n+\n1\u2212\nz(t) = wt * 1 +\n2w 2\n2wt\n(1.7)\n\u0010\nsin(wt + 2\u03b1) \u2212 sin 2\u03b1 \u0011io\nsin(2wt) \u0011 \u0010\n\u2212 1\u2212\n=\n+ 1\u2212\nwt\n2wt\nn\nio\nc2 h\u0010\nsin(wt) \u0011 \u0010 1 \u2212 cos(2wt) \u0011\n= wt * 1 +\n+\nsin(wt\n+\n2\u03b1)\n.\n1\n\u2212\n2w 2\nwt\nwt\nIn the cases w = 0 the geodesic curve is the following:\n1 2 2\nc * t cos \u03b1 sin \u03b1.\n2\nThe cases |w| = 1 are trivial: (x, y) = (0, 0), z = w * t.\nx(t) = c * t cos \u03b1, y(t) = c * t sin \u03b1, z(t) =\n\n(1.8)\n\n\fOn lattice coverings of Nil space by congruent geodesic balls\n\n5\n\nDefinition 1.1 The distance d(P1 , P2 ) between the points P1 and P2 is defined by\nthe arc length of the geodesic curve from P1 to P2 .\n\n1.1 On the geodesic ball\nIn our work [6] we have introduced the followin definitions:\nDefinition 1.2 The geodesic sphere of radius R with centre at the point P1 is\ndefined as the set of all points P2 in the space with the condition d(P1 , P2 ) =\nR. Moreover, we require that the geodesic sphere is a simply connected surface\nwithout selfintersection in the Nil space.\nRemark 1.2 We will see that this last condition depends on radius R.\nDefinition 1.3 The body of the geodesic sphere of centre P1 and of radius R in\nthe Nil space is called geodesic ball, denoted by BP1 (R), i.e. Q \u2208 BP1 (R) iff\n0 \u2264 d(P1 , Q) \u2264 R.\nRemark 1.3 Henceforth, typically we choose the origin as centre of the sphere\nand its ball, by the homogeneity of Nil.\nWe apply the quadratic mapping M : Nil \u2212\u2192 A3 at (1.5) to the geodesic\nsphere S, its M-image is denoted by S \u2032 = M(S).\nWe choose a point P (x(R, \u03b8, \u03b1), y(R, \u03b8, \u03b1), z(R, \u03b8, \u03b1)) lying on a sphere S\nof radius R with centre at the origin.
