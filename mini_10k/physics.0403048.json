In many\nbulk compounds, doping can significantly affect some\nglobal property, and alloying is a common way to tailor a completely new kind of material. At the mesoscale\nlevel, size is another complicating factor, giving rise to\nfurther changes with respect to the macroscopic object.\nTo a large extent, most expectations of nanotechnology\nhave been put into the electronic and catalytic properties\nof small atomic clusters. Therefore, it should not be surprising that numerous theoretical studies of mixed clusters were devoted to bimetallic clusters. In particular,\nthere has been a significant amount of work at the level\nof sophisticated electronic structure calculations,1,2,3 but\nthese were often limited to small sizes due to the numerical effort involved. On a different scale of chemical\ncomplexity, many studies have been carried out using\nexplicit, empirical force fields4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 in order to\ninvestigate the segregation properties of these clusters.\nThere are several driving forces toward mixing or segregation in binary systems:\n(i) the difference in atomic sizes;\n(ii) the difference in surface energies;\n(iii) minimization of the overall strain;\n(iv) the number of interactions between unlike atoms.\nThese factors can often compete with each other. For instance, minimizing surface energies does usually not increase with the number of interactions between different\natoms. Also, even though this is not our prime interest\nhere, it should be noted that kinetic factors can be crucial\nin this problem.13\nIn particular, Vach and coworkers have found from experiments and simulations of mixed rare-gas clusters that\n\nsome anomalous enrichment effects could be observed\ndue to the growth by pick-up of these systems.14 Very\nrecently, radial segregation and layering have been observed in large Ar/Xe clusters formed in an adiabatic\nexpansion by Tchaplyguine et al.15 using photoelectron\nspectroscopy measurements. These data have also been\ntheoretically interpreted by Amar and Smaby.16\nFortunately, mixed rare-gas systems can be quite safely\ndescribed using simple pairwise potentials such as the\nLennard-Jones (LJ) potential. More accurate potentials\nare of course also available, even though we will have\nno need for them in the present, mostly methodological\nwork. Hence they are much more convenient to study in\na broad size range, not only for their structure but also\ntheir dynamics or thermodynamics. It is known from\nprevious studies that the topography of the potential energy surfaces of homogeneous LJ clusters can be very\npeculiar, as for the sizes 38 or 75.17 The multiple-funnel\nstructure of these energy landscapes makes it especially\nhard to locate the most stable structures (global minima) or to simulate the finite-temperature behavior of\nthese clusters in an ergodic way. The effects of mixing\ndifferent rare-gas atoms on cluster structure and thermodynamics have been studied for the specific size 13\nby Frantz on the examples of Ar\u2013Kr mixtures18 as well\nas Ne\u2013Ar mixtures.19 Fanourgakis et al. have also investigated these latter compounds.20 A systematic work\nof Ar\u2013Xe mixed clusters of 13 and 19 atoms has been\ncarried out by Munro and coworkers,21 including some\nglobal optimization and Monte Carlo simulations. Mixed\nclusters involving lighter species such as H2 and D2 have\nbeen investigated using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations (PIMC) by Chakravarty.22 More recently, Sabo,\nDoll and Freeman reported a rather complete study of\nthe energy landscapes23,24 and melting phase change25 in\nmixed Ar\u2013Ne clusters. In this work quantum delocalization and the effects of impurities on cluster properties\nwere also accounted for using PIMC techniques.\n\n\f2\nThe main conclusion of these studies is that atomic\nheterogeneity can be responsible for a drastic increase in\ncomplexity of the energy landscapes of rare-gas clusters.\nThis complexity is manifested by numerous new low-lying\nminima in competitive funnels, characterized by the same\noverall geometrical arrangement but different permutations of unlike atoms. Following Jellinek and Krissinel,4\nwe will refer to such isomers as \"homotops.\" The presence of several homotops on a given energy landscape often induces solid-solid transitions, which can be detected\nby some feature in the heat capacity,18,19,20,21,26 even\nthough they can be washed out by quantum effects.25\nAs shown by Munro et al.,21 the various funnels corresponding to different homotops of a same geometry are\nseparated by significant energy barriers. This explains\nthe difficulty or even failure of simulation methods to\nachieve ergodic sampling of these systems, albeit small.21\nA similar situation is found in Lennard-Jones polymers,27\nwhere a large number of isomers are based on the same\ngeometrical arrangement, differing only in the path linking the monomers.\nBeyond the actual rare-gases, binary Lennard-Jones\ncompounds have been investigated in both the cluster\nand bulk regimes. Clarke and coworkers looked at phase\nseparation of small particles with equal compositions.28\nBased on Monte Carlo simulations, they sketched a\nphase diagram in the general structure of liquid clusters. Bulk binary Lennard-Jones systems have been seen\nto provide relatively simple numerical models for glass\nformation.29,30,31,32,33,34 Most often, the LJ interactions\nin such studies have been tuned in a non-additive way in\norder to hinder crystallisation. In another related work,\nLee and coworkers35 have investigated the role of atomic\nsize ratio in binary and ternary metallic alloys.\nInterestingly, severaly links between the physics and\nchemistry of clusters and those of supercooled liquids\nand glasses have been established since the pioneering\nwork by Frank.36 The initial suggestion that the local order in simple liquids is not crystalline but icosahedral36\n(more generally polytetrahedral) has since been verified experimentally37 and theoretically.29,38 From the\nclusters viewpoint, the favored finite-size structures of\ngood model glassformers have been shown by Doye and\ncoworkers to be polytetrahedral.39\nThe 38-atom homogeneous Lennard-Jones cluster is\nknown to show some glassy properties, especially slow\nrelaxation to the ground state,40 due to the competition between two stable funnels on the energy landscape,\ncorresponding to truncated octahedral and icosahedral\nshapes, respectively. Due to entropic effects,40,41 a solidsolid transition occurs between the two funnels, at temperatures lower than the melting point. The crystal-like\nconfiguration of this cluster makes it a good candidate to\nfurther investigate the relationship between cluster structure and criteria for glassification.\nBecause homogeneous LJ38 constitutes a relatively difficult task for global optimization algorithms, binary\nclusters of the same size can be expected to be much\n\nworse. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient\nway to deal with the multiple new minima introduced by\nunlike atoms within a general Monte Carlo global minimization scheme. This algorithm will then be applied\nto the 38- and 55-atom cases, in mixtures of Xe with either Ar or Kr atoms. In the next section, we present the\nmethod and test it on the simple cases of the 13- and\n19-atom clusters. In Sec. III we give our results obtained\nat sizes 38 and 55 and we correlate them to the different\nglassforming abilities of the bulk mixtures. We finally\nconclude in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nGlobal optimization of cluster structure42 is currently best achieved using either genetic algorithms43 or\nthe Monte Carlo+minimization method,44 also known\nas basin-hopping (BH).45 The case of homogeneous\nLennard-Jones clusters is among the most documented\nof cluster physics, and an up-to-date table of putative\nglobal minima can be found in Ref. 46. Even though\nit can never be guaranteed that global minimization has\nbeen successful, it is likely that all important structural\nforms of LJ clusters have been found up to more than 100\natoms. These include icosahedral, truncated octahedral,\ndecahedral as well as tetrahedral arrangements.\nCompared to homogeneous clusters, the available data\non heterogeneous systems is rather scarce. Besides the\nspecific works by Frantz on the 13-atom Ne\u2013Ar and Kr\u2013\nAr clusters,18,19 Munro et al. used a parallel version of\nthe BH scheme, similar to the replica-exchange Monte\nCarlo method,47 where several trajectories are run simultaneously at various temperatures.21 Although these authors looked at moderately large clusters, they reported\nsignificant difficulties to locate global minima at specific\ncompositions, as in Xe10 Ar3 or Xe13 Ar6 , for instance.21\n\nA.\n\nOptimization algorithm\n\nA natural problem occuring using the basin-hopping\nmethod is that many of the low-lying minima are expected to be related to each other via particle exchange.\nSuch a process only occurs via large deformations of\nthe remaining cluster, hence it is quite unprobable. As\nin condensed matter physics,48,49,50 allowing exchange\nmoves between particles as a possible Monte Carlo step\nmay result in notably faster convergence, provided that\nthe interactions are not too dissimilar. Actually, optimization of mixed clusters on the lattice formed by\nthe homogeneous system has already been studied by\nRobertson and coworkers.51 Here we do not wish to restrict to such situations.\nIn the framework of global optimization methods, the\nlocal minimization stage removes the possible energetic\npenalty associated to replacing a small atom by a bigger one. We can thus expect some increased efficiency\n\n\f3\nof the algorithm in case of multiple homotops. Now we\nconvert the extra numerical cost of running parallel trajectories at various temperatures into running them at\nvarious compositions, at the same fixed temperature T\nfor all compositions. For a Xp Yn\u2212p compound, each of\nthe n trajectories is then labelled with the number p of\nX atoms, running from 0 to n. Exchange moves between\nadjacent trajectories (from p to p + 1) thus need to incorporate the transmutation of two atoms (one for each\nconfiguration) into the other atom type to preserve composition. As in most Monte Carlo processes, the probability of attempting such moves must be set in advance\nas a parameter.\nThe global optimization algorithm can thus be summarized into its main steps. Keeping the above notations\n(p)\nfor atom types, and denoting Ri the configuration at\nstep i of trajectory p, we start the optimization process\nusing fully random configurations, but locally optimized.\n1. With probability Pex , it is decided whether an exchange between adjacent trajectories will be attempted or not. If so, then the two trajectories\ninvolved in the exchange are determined randomly.\n2. For each composition p not concerned by any ex(p)\nchange, a new configuration Ri+1 is generated from\n(p)\n\nRi using either several particle exchanges or large\natomic moves. The probability to select particle exchanges is denoted Pswap , and the number of simultaneous exchanges is allowed to fluctuate randomly\nmax\n. If atomic moves are selected,\nbetween 1 and Nswap\nthen each atom is displaced randomly around its\nprevious location in the three directions by a random amount of maximum magnitude h(p) . In both\n(p)\ncases, Ri+1 is obtained after local minimization.\n3. In case of an exchange between adjacent trajecto(p+1)\n(p)\ncorries, the two configurations Ri and Ri\nresponding to these trajectories are then swapped,\n(p)\none X atom of Ri being transmuted into Y, and\n(p+1)\nbeing transmuted into X.\none Y atom of Ri\n(p+1)\n(p)\nAgain, the configurations Ri+1 and Ri+1 are obtained after local minimization.\n4. Each new configuration is accepted with the usual\nMetropolis acceptance probability at temperature\nT.\nThe algorithm has two main parameters, namely Pex\nand Pswap . The maximum number of particle exchange\nmax\nmoves, Nswap\n, was set to 4 in this study. We expect\nthat better results could be obtained by adjusting this\nparameter appropriately, probably taking higher values\nfor larger clusters or for compostitions close to 50%. The\namplitude of atomic displacement, h(p) , is set to half the\nequilibrium distance in the X2 dimer for p = 0, half the\nequilibrium distance in the Y2 dimer for p = n, and is\ninterpolated linearly between these two values for 0 <\n\np < n. In the present work, the exchange probabilities\nwere taken as Pex = 0.5 and Pswap = 0.9, hence allowing\na rather large probability of sampling among homotops\nof a same structure.\n\nB.\n\nBenchmark calculations\n\nLow-energy structures for mixtures of xenon with either argon or krypton atoms have been first investigated\nfor the sizes n = 13 and n = 19, as there are quantitative global optimization data available for Ar\u2013Xe clusters\nfrom the Jordan group.21 We have adjusted the LJ values\nused by Leitner et al.52 to reproduce the clusters energies found by Munro and coworkers.21. With respect to\nargon, the present data for \u03c3 and \u03b5 are thus \u03c3KrKr =\n1.12403, \u03c3XeXe = 1.206, \u03c3KrXe = 1.16397, \u03c3ArXe = 1.074,\n\u03b5KrKr = 1.373534, \u03b5XeXe = 1.852, \u03b5KrXe = 1.59914, and\n\u03b5ArXe = 1.48. Global optimization of Ar\u2013Xe and Kr\u2013Xe\nclusters was performed using the parallel algorithm previously described, simultaneously for all compositions,\nfor a maximum number of 10000 minimization steps per\ntrajectory, and at T = 0. Ten independent runs were\ncarried out to estimate an average search length for each\ncomposition. All global minima reported by Munro et\nal. were always found within the number of MC steps\nallowed.\nThe results for Arn Xe13\u2212n and Krn Xe13\u2212n clusters are\ngiven in Table I. The average search length is generally\nhigher for compositions close to 50%, for which the number of homotops is maximum for a given isomer, regardless of symmetry. The statistics presently obtained for\nAr\u2013Xe clusters show that the average search is between\n10 and 1000 times faster than using conventional parallel basin-hopping.21 Kr\u2013Xe clusters roughly exhibit the\nsame level of difficulty, but we do not see any strong evidence for particularly severe cases: Ar3 Xe10 even seems\nto be one of the easiest.\nSimilarly, the results obtained for Arn Xe19\u2212n clusters\nshow a significant improvement over fixed-composition\nbasin-hopping.21 They are given in Table II along with\nthe corresponding data for Krn Xe19\u2212n clusters. This\ntime, the algorithm is about 1\u2013100 times faster depending\non n, the average search length being still longer for equal\ncompositions. For both the 13- and 19-atom clusters, all\nglobal minima are homotops of either the single or double icosahedron. This situation is particularly suited for\nour algorithm, especially the exchange moves.\nInitially, the configurations at all compositions are random. The chances to locate the proper structure (without any consideration of the homotops) increase linearly\nwith the number of trajectories. As soon as the right\nstructure is found, the algorithm naturally optimizes\natom types to find the most stable homotop, hence the\nglobal minimum. But it can also communicate the structure to the adjacent trajectories, until all compositions\nonly need to sample among the permutational homotops.\nWhen the interactions are not too dissimilar (as in Kr\u2013\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Global optimization results for Arn Xe13\u2212n and Krn Xe13\u2212n clusters.

By setting Pswap to one and starting\n\nall trajectories from this minimum, the algorithm can\nbe even more successful, and we estimated the average\nsearch length to be further reduced by a factor about 3\nwith respect to the values given in Table II. However,\nwhen the interactions differ significantly among atoms\n\n\f5\ntypes, or when the energy landscape of the homogeneous\ncluster does not display a single steep funnel, it becomes\nmuch harder to make a guess about structure in these\nbinary clusters.\n\nHence it is not surprising that this peculiar structure was\nfirst found by construction.56,57\n\nA.\n\nE+S, T=0\nE, T=0\nS, T=0\nE+S, T=1\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nXe atoms\nFIG. 1: Mean first passage time of the parallel optimization algorithm to locate the global minimum structure of\nAr19\u2212n Xen clusters versus n.

The\nresults at T = 1 with both kinds of moves are also displayed.\n\nFig. 1 shows the mean first passage time needed to\nlocate the global minima of Ar19\u2212n Xen using the algorithm under different conditions. Disabling swap moves\nbetween atom types or exchange moves between adjacent trajectories usually attenuates the efficiency. Employing a rather high temperature is even worse, because\nthe cluster may easily leave its optimal lattice. This contrasts with optimizing homogeneous clusters, where using\na nonzero temperature helps the system to escape from a\nfunnel.53 However, if the energy gap between homotops\nof the same lattice increases and gets close to the gap between different lattices, we expect the zero temperature\nmethod not to be the best. But in such cases, even the\nnotion of a lattice should be questionned.\n\nWe have attempted to locate global minima for binary\nAr\u2013Xe and Kr\u2013Xe clusters of size 38, using the parallel\nbasin-hopping algorithm previously described. Because\nof the huge number of homotops at this size, and most\nimportantly because of the structural competition between icosahedra and truncated octahedra, we cannot be\nfully confident that the global optimization was successful. Therefore, the energies reported in Table III for Ar\u2013\nXe clusters should be taken with caution, as they could\nprobably be bettered. The same data for 38-atom Kr\u2013Xe\nclusters is also reported in Table V.\nSpecifically to this cluster size, all minima found during the optimization process were categorized as either\nicosahedral or cubic-like, depending on the energy of the\ncorresponding homogeneous isomer found by quenching.\nIn cases where the cubic isomer was not found among the\nisomers, we performed additional optimizations starting\nfrom this structure, setting Pswap to one. This mainly\noccured for Ar\u2013Xe clusters. Eventually, two series of\nminima were obtained for each of the icosahedral and\noctahedral funnels. We did not find any decahedral isomer that could compete with these structural types, even\nthough some evidence for stabilizing decahedra by doping\nwas reported in Ref. 58.\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\nIII.\n\nSTRUCTURAL TRANSITIONS\n\nIn this section we focus on two larger sizes, for which\nno global optimization result is available.

Besides some strong variations sometimes seen from one composition to the next,\nand which can be attributed to usual finite-size effects,\ngeneral trends can be clearly observed.\nFirst, Kr38\u2212n Xen clusters are always most stable in the\ncubic shape. Actually, changing the composition most\noften further stabilizes truncated octahedra, and only\nrarely enhances the stability of icosahedra, which occurs\nfor n > 29 and n = 21. Conversely Ar38\u2212n Xen clusters are preferentially found icosahedral, exceptions being\nn > 35 and n = 0. This is an example of a compositioninduced structural transition between the two funnels of\nthe energy landscape.\nFrom a computational point of view, it should be noted\nthat the optimization algorithm was able to locate the\ntruncated octahedral minima for Kr\u2013Xe clusters by itself, starting from disordered minima, and that the extra\nruns starting from this structure only produced slightly\nmore stable homotops. This is another illustration of the\nefficiency of the present parallel optimization method.\nThe general degree of disorder is higher in icosahedral\nstructures than in the cubic-like isomer. Hence it is more\ndifficult to put up the latter geometry with very unlike\ninteractions, as in Ar\u2013Xe clusters. Cubic homotops of\nargon with xenon are rather distorted, but the strain is\nmuch lower with krypton instead of argon.

Icosahedral Kr\u2013Xe\nclusters also prefer to have Xe atoms at the center, but\nthe increased strain is too high a penalty, which explains\nthat cubic structures are favored over icosahedra.\nIn general, no complete phase separation is found in\nAr\u2013Xe clusters, even though Ar atoms seem to fit best at\nthe centre of the cluster. In both cases, surface energies\nthus play an important role. Mixing in these clusters can\nbe estimated using radial distribution functions.54 Here\nwe use the same index as Jellinek and Krissinel,4 namely\nthe overall mixing ratio \u03b3 defined as4\n\nEXp Yn\u2212p\n\n\u03b3(Xp Yn\u2212p ) =\n\u2212 EXp (Xp Xn\u2212p ) \u2212 EYn\u2212p (Yp Yn\u2212p )\n,\nEXp Yn\u2212p\n\n(1)\n\nwhere EXp Yn\u2212p is the binding energy of cluster Xp Yn\u2212p ,\nEXp (Xp Xn\u2212p ) the binding energy of subcluster Xp in the\nhomogeneous cluster Xp Xn\u2212p at the same atomic configuration as Xp Yn\u2212p , and a similar definition for the last\nterm of Eq. (1). As seen from Table III, the mixing ratio\nincreases notably in Ar\u2013Xe clusters, up to more than 60%\nfor some compositions. Kr\u2013Xe clusters, despite exhibiting some core-surface segregation, show similar variations\nof the mixing ratio with composition, with only slightly\nsmaller values of \u03b3.

(1), is a rather ambiguous parameter for\nquantifying the extent of mixing in this small cluster.\nThe optimal structure of an homogeneous cluster described with a pairwise potential results from a competition between maximizing the number of nearest neighbors and minimizing the strain energy, or penalty induced by distorting these bonds.57 Binary Lennard-Jones\nsystems exhibit several extra complications due to the\nvarious ways of rearranging atom types in a given structure. In these systems, the strain varies notably among\nthe homotops, especially in clusters made of very unlike\natoms. However, our results indicate that the same general rules hold for homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. In Ar19 Xe19 , the strain is rather high, but the number of contacts is also high. In Kr19 Xe19 , both the strain\nand the number of nearest neighbors are much smaller.\nTo investigate the role of heterogeneity on the strain,\nwe have computed the various contributions to the reduced strain energies in Ar38\u2212n Xen clusters. The strain\nenergies are defined for Ar\u2013Ar, Xe\u2013Xe, and Ar\u2013Xe interactions as follows:57\nstrain\nLJ\nnn\nEAr\u2212Ar\n= VAr\u2212Ar\n+ NAr\u2212Ar\n\u03b5Ar\u2212Ar ,\nstrain\nLJ\nnn\nEAr\u2212Xe\n= VAr\u2212Xe\n+ NAr\u2212Xe\n\u03b5ArXe ,\nstrain\nLJ\nnn\nEXe\u2212Xe\n= VXe\u2212Xe\n+ NXe\u2212Xe\n\u03b5Xe\u2212Xe .\n\nLJ\nIn these equations, VX\u2212Y\nis the (negative) total binding\nnn\nenergy between atoms X and Y , NX\u2212Y\nis the number\nof X\u2013Y nearest neighbors, and \u03b5X\u2212Y is the LennardJones well depth corresponding to the interaction between X and Y atoms. Reduced strain energies are then\ndefined as estrain = E strain /N nn \u03b5, in order to account for\nthe different magnitudes of the interactions among atom\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nXe atoms\nFIG. 4: Reduced strain energies for alike and unlike interactions in Ar38\u2212n Xen clusters, versus composition n.\n\nThe pattern exhibited by the reduced strain versus\ncomposition shows different behaviors for clusters having\nmostly argon or xenon atoms. For n < 20, most strain\nis carried by interactions between alike atoms. This\ncase is illustrated by Ar9 Xe29 in Fig. 3, where a kind\nof core/surface phase separation occurs. Here surface\nenergies are also important, but the situation is rather\ndifferent from mixed cubic Kr\u2013Xe clusters. Because having the xenon atoms at the inner sites of the icosahedral\nstructure would maximise the strain of these atoms, it\nis much more favorable to have the smaller atoms inside\nand the xenon atoms outside. The cubic Kr\u2013Xe structures, on the other hand, are not especially strained, and\nhaving the smaller atoms inside would lead to an energetic penalty.\nWhen the number of Ar atoms increases above about\n19 in the 38-atom cluster, interactions between unlike\natoms are significantly more strained. The case of\nAr29 Xe9 depicted in Fig. 3 is perticularly informative: Xe\natoms are located scarcely among the icosahedral cluster,\nand relieve the structure from too much strain at the expense of only few Xe\u2013Xe interactions. In this case, cluster\nstructure is driven by the number of unlike interactions.\nIt is also worth noting that a few compositions are\nespecially weakly strained; this occurs when the global\nminimum is octahedral, but also in the range 19 < n <\n24. For these latter clusters, the core/surface segregation\nand the number of unlike interactions are both optimal.\n\n\f8\nB.\n\nPolytetrahedral transitions in the 55-atom\nAr\u2013Xe clusters\n\nThe cubic to icosahedral transition seen above actually favors polyicosahedral (or anti-Mackay) structures.\nThe strain reduction produced by size disparity in 38atom Ar\u2013Xe clusters helps in stabilizing these kinds of\nstructures, which are otherwise replaced by multilayer (or\nMackay) geometries in the homogeneous clusters. Since\nmost LJ clusters under the size of 38 atoms are most stable as polytetrahedra,55 we do not expect that changing\ncomposition will affect them to a large extent. As a notable exception, the 6-atom homogeneous LJ cluster is\nmore stable in its octahedral isomer. The lowest energy\ngeometries of mixed Ar\u2013Xe clusters containing 6 atoms,\nrepresented in Fig. 5, show polytetrahedral transitions\nfor two compositions, namely Ar4 Xe2 and Ar3 Xe3 . This\nbehavior mimics somewhat what was observed for the\nlarger 38-atom cluster, only at a smaller scale. In particular, and as in Fig. 2, polytetrahedral arrangements\nare seen to be more convenient for Xenon compositions\nunder 50%.\nPossible polytetrahedral structures of mixed Ar\u2013Xe\nclusters have been investigated for the size 55, whose\nmost stable isomer is well known as a perfect double\nlayer (Mackay) icosahedron for the homogeneous system.\nThe global optimization results are summarized in Table IV for all compositions. For this we also conducted\ncomplementary calculations on the 2-layer lattice. Each\nputative global minimum was labelled either as Mackay\nicosahedron or, when the lattice structure does not exactly match the multilayer icosahedron, as polytetrahedral. Most compositions become increasingly polytetrahedral as the ratio of Xenon atoms increases, even though\nthe polytetrahedral character may often be only local.\nTwo examples of lowest energy structures are represented in Fig. 6, corresponding to n = 15 and n = 40.\nThe obvious deviations of the geometry of the former\nfrom the Mackay icosahedron and the various occupation sites of the heavy atoms for both structures illustrate again that there is no simple rule that determine\nthe most stable minima when the atomic sizes do significantly differ from each other.\n\nceptance probabilities in MC simulations at low temperatures, especially for Ar\u2013Xe clusters. Therefore, even with\npowerful methods such as parallel tempering or multicanonical Monte Carlo, reaching convergence in 38-atom\nLJ clusters does not seem currently feasible to us.\nAs an alternative, we have chosen to investigate\nsolid-solid transitions by means of the superposition\napproach.59,60 For a given cluster, databases of minima in\neach of the icosahedral (ICO) and truncated octahedral\n(FCC) funnels were constructed using the optimization\nalgorithm. For each composition and each of the two funnels, no more than 2000 distinct minima were considered.\nThe classical partition function of the Y38\u2212p Xep cluster\n(Y=Ar or Kr) restricted to funnel A=FCC or ICO is approximated by a harmonic superposition over all minima\nof the databases, which belong to this funnel:60\nQA (\u03b2) =\n\nX\n\nni\n\ni\u2208A\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b2Ei )\n,\n(\u03b2h\u03bd\u0304i )3n\u22126\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T is the inverse temperature, \u03bd\u0304i the geometric mean vibrational frequency, ni = 2p!(n \u2212 p)!/hi\nwith hi the order of the point group of minimum i and\nn = 38. We do not consider quantum effects here, although they may be important at low temperatures,61\nsince delocalization or zero-point effects are not expected\nto be significant for rare gases as heavy as krypton or\nxenon.\nWithin the harmonic superposition approximation, a\nsolid-solid transition occurs when QFCC = QICO .62 This\nlatter equation is solved numerically in \u03b2 or T , its solution is denoted Tss . In cases where icosahedra are\nenergetically more stable than octahedra, a solid-solid\ntransition can occur if some cubic structures are entropically favored, which requires lower vibrational frequencies and/or lower symmetries. We did not find such situations in our samples of Ar\u2013Xe clusters, therefore we\nrestrict to Kr\u2013Xe clusters in the following.\nSimilar to transitions between funnels, transitions between homotops will happen if their partition functions\nare equal.

The extremely large number\nof isomers (including homotops) in the energy landscape\nof binary Lennard-Jones clusters, added to the expected\npresence of significant energy barriers between icosahedral and cubic isomers,40 prevent finite-temperature simulations from being conducted in a reliably ergodic way\nwith the presently available tools.

(3).\nFinally, a third temperature has a strong consequence\non cluster structure, namely the melting temperature.\nIts estimation from either simulations or superpositions\napproximations is already quite difficult for the homogeneous LJ38 cluster,40,41 and we did not attempt to\ncompute it for binary clusters. However, the previous\nstudy by Frantz18 has shown that the melting point\nin mixed, 13-atom Ar\u2013Kr clusters varies quite regularly\n(approximately quadratically) with composition. As a\nsimple rule, we will assume that the melting point of\nKr38\u2212n Xen , Tmelt (n), lies inside some range between the\napproximate melting points of Kr38 and Xe38 , respectively. From the results obtained by Doye and Wales40\nand the Monte Carlo data of Ref. 41 for the LJ38 cluster, we get Tmelt(0) \u2243 0.234 and Tmelt(38) \u2243 0.315 in\nreduced LJ units of argon. This provides rough limits to\nthe actual melting points of Kr\u2013Xe clusters, for the price\nof neglecting finite-size effects.\n\nFIG. 7: Solid-solid transition temperature (full circles) between the octahedral and icosahedral funnels, estimated from\na harmonic superposition approximation, versus composition\nin Kr38\u2212n Xen clusters.

We notice first that the structural transition temperature Tss\nvaries quite regularly with composition in both the ranges\nn < 19 and n > 21, and that it shows strong size effects\nbetween these limits. Several situations are predicted to\noccur depending on the relative values of Tss , Th and\nTmelt.\nIn most cases, Tmelt < Tss . That melting takes place at\ntemperatures lower than the cubic/icosahedral transition\nsimply nullifies the transition between structural types.\nHowever, this extra stability of the octahedral funnel may\nhave a consequence on the melting point itself, which is\nlikely to increase. Still, this situation implies that simu-\n\n\f10\nTABLE IV: Global optimization results for Ar55\u2212n Xen .

In these clusters,\nheterogeneity is not sufficient for the thermodynamical\nbehavior of the cluster to deviate too much from those of\nthe homogeneous system.\nThe transition between homotops usually occurs prior\nto melting. Thermal equilibrium within the cubic funnels\nthus involves several homotops (and \"restricted\" solidsolid transitions), and the corresponding thermodynamical state could be probably simulated using specifically\ndesigned exchange moves between outer particles within\na Monte Carlo scheme.\nA few clusters melt before exhibiting any transition\nbetween homotops. This occurs for instance at n = 11, 13\nor 15. For these sizes the structural transition also occurs\nat temperatures higher than the estimated melting point.\nThese cases should pose less problems to conventional\nsimulations than the homogeneous cluster.\n\nn\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n\nMixing ratio Energy Point group\n0.53\n-417.785\nC1\n0.53\n-421.225\nCs\n0.51\n-424.566\nC1\n0.49\n-427.888\nC1\n0.47\n-431.565\nC1\n0.46\n-435.680\nC1\n0.45\n-439.565\nC1\n0.42\n-443.335\nC1\n0.41\n-446.892\nC1\n0.41\n-449.965\nC1\n0.36\n-454.356\nCs\n0.35\n-458.203\nCs\n0.34\n-462.564\nC2v\n0.30\n-466.709\nC2v\n0.28\n-472.191\nIh\n0.26\n-475.967\nC5v\n0.24\n-479.739\nD5d\n0.22\n-483.495\nC3v\n0.20\n-487.219\nC2v\n0.18\n-490.910\nCs\n0.16\n-494.585\nC2\n0.14\n-498.231\nCs\n0.12\n-501.860\nC2v\n0.10\n-505.467\nC3v\n0.08\n-509.052\nD5d\n0.06\n-512.616\nC5v\n0.04\n-516.170\nIh\n0\n-517.168\nIh\n\nD.\n\nType\nPT\nPT\nPT\nPT\nPT\nPT\nPT\nPT\nPT\nPT\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\nMI\n\nGlassy behavior\n\nThe previous results have shown that finite-size Ar\u2013\nXe compounds show a preferential polytetrahedral order,\neven for very low doping rates, over octahedral order. On\nthe other hand, Kr\u2013Xe clusters at the same sizes further\nfavor cubic order. Since polytetrahedral order is known\nto be present in liquids and, more generally, in disordered structural glasses, it seems natural to correlate the\nbehavior observed in these clusters to the dynamics of\nthe corresponding bulk materials.29\nWe have simulated the cooling of 108-atom binary\nrare-gas liquids, using a simple Metropolis Monte Carlo\nscheme under constant volume and temperature. Initially the atoms are placed randomly into a cubic box of\nside L, and periodic boundaries are treated in the minimum image convention. The LJ interactions were not\ntruncated, and the simulations consisted of 100 stages of\n105 MC cycles each, linearly spaced in temperature.\nThree compositions have been selected, following our\n\n\f11\nknowledge of the cluster structure. For each composition,\ndifferent length sizes L and different temperature ranges\n[Tmin , Tmax ] were chosen in order to cover both sides of\nthe melting point. In the first mixture, 24 xenon atoms\nand 84 argon atoms are simulated with L = 4.8815 LJ\nunits of argon, with 0.1 \u2264 T \u2264 1. In the second mixture, 24 xenon atoms are added to 84 krypton atoms at\nL = 5.487 and 0.15 \u2264 T \u2264 1.5. The third mixture consists of 9 argon atoms and 99 xenon atoms at L = 5.887\nand 0.2 \u2264 T \u2264 2. Even though we did not attempt to\nlocate the most stable crystalline forms for these mixtures, our searches close to the face-centred cubic morphology showed that the most stable configurations for\nthese mixtures always had some cubic order. It is likely\nthat the actual ground states for such systems are indeed\ncrystalline.63\nThe average root mean square fluctuation of the bond\ndistances, also known as the Lindemann index \u03b4, universally characterizes the thermodynamical state of the\ncondensed system as either solid or liquid, depending\non its value being lower or higher than about 0.15. To\nquantify the extent of crystalline order, we have used the\nbond order parameter Q4 introduced by Steinhardt and\ncoworkers.64 The two parameters \u03b4 and Q4 allow us to\nfollow in Monte Carlo time the cooling processes for all\nmaterials in a simultaneous way, independently of thermodynamical characteristics such as the melting temperature.\n0.20\n\nIn the (Ar84 Xe24 ) system, \u03b4 regularly decreases but\nQ4 always remain below 0.05. Therefore crystallization\nnever takes place, and the final state obtained by quenching is significantly higher in energy than some crystalline\nforms; this is typical of glass formation.\nIn (Kr84 Xe24 ), all simulations show some rather sharp\ntransition from a (high \u03b4, low Q4 ) state to a (low \u03b4,\nhigh Q4 ) state as \u03b4 crosses about 0.1. The temperatures where crystallisation occurs may vary somewhat\namong the cooling runs, in the same way as they are expected to depend on the cooling rate. Lastly, the case of\n(Ar9 Xe99 ) is intermediate: while most simulations end\nup in a nearly fully crystalline phase (Q4 \u223c 0.15), a few\nof them show a limited degree of cubic ordering in the\nsolid phase, Q4 having values close to 0.07.\nThese results very closely reflect our previous data on\nbinary, 38-atom clusters of the same materials. In terms\nof composition, the first mixture corresponds to Ar30 Xe8 ,\nwhich clearly favors icosahedral shapes over truncated\noctahedra. The second mixture reminds of Kr30 Xe8 , for\nwhich the cubic structure is even more stable than in\nthe homogeneous cluster. The third mixture should be\ncompared to Ar3 Xe35 , which favors icosahedra only moderately.\nThis correlation found here between cluster structure\nand the glassforming ability of the bulk material confirms previous analyses on the icosahedral local order in\nliquids and glasses,29,38 as well as the recent conclusions\nobtained by Doye et al.39 that clusters of good glassformers indeed show a polytetrahedral order.\n\n(Ar84Xe24)\n0.15\n\nIV.\n\n(Kr84Xe24)\n\nQ4\n\n(Ar14Xe94)\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\nLindemann \u03b4\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\nFIG. 8: Correlation between the Lindemann parameter \u03b4 and\nthe order parameter Q4 along cooling simulations of Ar\u2013Xe\nand Kr\u2013Xe bulk mixtures.\n\nThe correlation between \u03b4 and Q4 for ten cooling simulations of each of the three bulk binary compounds is\nrepresented in Fig. 8. In all cases, the Lindemann parameter covers the whole range 0.01 < \u03b4 < 0.18, indicating\nthat the melting point was indeed crossed. However, the\nthree compounds display very contrasted cooling behaviors.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs far as structural and dynamical properties are concerned, binary compounds show a significantly richer\ncomplexity with respect to homogeneous clusters. The\nwork reported in the present paper was intended to\nachieve several goals. First, a parallel global optimization algorithm was designed to locate the most stable\nstructures of mixed rare-gas clusters, beyond the lattice\napproximations of Robertson and co-workers.51 Based\non the basin-hopping or Monte Carlo+minimization\nalgorithm,44,45 this algorithm includes exchange moves\nbetween particles at fixed composition as well as exchange moves between configurations at different compositions. Tests on simple Arn Xe13\u2212n and Arn Xe19\u2212n\nclusters show that the method is quite efficient, in addition to being easy to implement. For these systems,\nwe have found that the choice of a very low temperature works best as it allows some significant time to be\nspent for optimizing the search for homotops on a same\ncommon lattice.\nPutative global minima for Ar38\u2212n Xen and Kr38\u2212n Xen\nclusters have been investigated for all compositions. The\nstructure of Ar\u2013Xe compounds is mainly polytetrahedral,\nexcept at very low doping rates. Kr\u2013Xe clusters not only\nremain as truncated octahedra, but mixing the two rare\n\n\f12\ngases even favors these cubic structures over icosahedra.\nWe see some significant trend toward core/surface phase\nseparation in Ar\u2013Xe clusters with n > 20 and in all Kr\u2013\nXe clusters. However, these demixing behaviors are not\ndue to the same factors, as Xe atoms favor outer sites\nto reduce strain in Ar\u2013Xe icosahedra, while they occupy\ninterior sites to maximize the number of bonds in Kr\u2013\nXe truncated octahedra. Conversely, Ar38\u2212n Xen clusters\nwith n < 20 exhibit a higher degree of mixing. Analysing\nthe strain in these stable structures confirms the presence\nof a structural transition near n = 20 in these systems.\nPolytetrahedral morphologies were also found as the\nmost stable structures of many mixed Ar\u2013Xe clusters\nwith 55 atoms, as soon as the relative number of Xe\natoms was large enough. The general conclusion thus\nseems that the extra strain introduced by mixing these\ndifferent elements penalizes the highly ordered (cubic or\n2-layer icosahedron) structures.\nWithin the harmonic superposition approximation, we\nhave estimated the temperatures required by the 38-atom\nKr\u2013Xe clusters to undergo a structural transition toward\nthe icosahedral funnel, or toward other octahedral homotops. For compositions with a doping rate higher than\n3/38, the structural transition temperature was seen to\noccur at temperatures higher than the extrapolated melting point. This mainly reflects the special stability of the\noctahedral structures, and has the probable consequence\nthat actual melting points increase somewhat. These predictions could probably be checked with numerical simulations. For most compositions, the transitions between\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nS. Chacko, M.

Therefore particle exchange moves will be necessary in order that simulations remain close to ergodic.\nFollowing previous results by other researchers,29,38,39\nwe have found some further evidence that criteria for\nglass formation in bulk materials may also lie in the parameters, which are responsible for stable cluster structures. Since the atomistic simulation of the dynamical\nvitrification process can generally be much harder than\nobtaining stable configurations of atomic clusters, we expect the approach followed in the present theoretical effort to be also useful in the community of glasses and\nsupercooled liquids.\nThe method is obviously not limited to rare-gases, and\nits application to other compounds, especially metallic\nnanoalloys, should be straightforward, except maybe for\nfine tuning its intrinsic parameters. From a methodological point of view, it could also be applied to materials\nwith more than two components. Work on ternary systems is currently in progress.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe wish to thank Dr. J. P. K. Doye and Prof. K.\nJ. Jordan for very useful discussions.
