NEUBERGER, J. W. NEUBERGER, D. W. NOID\n\n1. introduction\nThe most primitive form of a stadium is a circle, say of radius r. If\nwe separate the left and right halves of the circle slightly and connect\nthese two semi circles at the top and bottom by straight lines we have\na classical stadium (racetrack). Let a be the horizontal distance from\nthe center of the figure to either the left or right semi circle; that is, the\ndistance of each 'straightaway' is 2a.\nBy the 1970's researchers were using numerical studies to examine\nthe stochastic behavior of quantum mechanical systems corresponding\nto chaotic and quasi-periodic behavior in classical mechanics. In an\nunpublished letter written at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in\nthe early 1980's, [1], the authors studied a Hamiltonian as a free particle\nconfined in a stadion (stadium) boundary. They developed a FORTRAN\ncode to compute the 10 smallest eigenvalues of even-even symmetry for\nthe Schroedinger equation for this system and plotted (by hand!) line\ngraphs of the eigenvalues versus a/r for r = 1. The correlation plot\nshowed many avoided crossings. Word was that Wigner proved these\ngraphs could not cross when the corresponding eigenfunctions had the\nsame symmetry; but after the intervening years a firm reference evades\nus. Suggested earlier references include [2] - [6], and [7] for a more recent\npaper. Computations in [1] were done only for the upper right quadrant\nof the stadium and the symmetry was forced.\nThe present paper is based on the earlier work at Oak Ridge. We have\nused a slightly updated version of the old FORTRAN code, this time on\nthe entire region, again with r = 1. It is our purpose to indicate certain\nstriking properties of eigenfunctions near avoided crossings. Plots for\nthese eigenfunctions were not made at the time [1] was written, nor\nwere the data retained.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nB. NEUBERGER, J. W. NEUBERGER, D. W. NOID\n\n2. The eigenvalue problem\nWe now consider the eigenvalue problem\n\u2212u11 \u2212 u22 = \u03bbu\non the interior of the stadium where u is 0 on the boundary and \u03bb\nrepresents energy. For each stadium configuration determined by the\nseparation distance a the code picks out a designated number of eigenvalues \u03bb and solves for the values of the associated eigenfunctions u.\nMathematica was used to make surface and contour plots of the eigen\nfunctions. The contour plots provided especially accessible information\nso we concentrated on those. In fact, we visually selected eigenfunctions\nthat produced contour graphs that were 'even-even', symmetric about\nboth the x and y axes. Then we plotted line graphs of the eigenvalues,\nassociated with selected eigenfunctions, versus a/r = a and examined\nconsecutive pairs of curves.\nThe first figure indicates the third, fourth and fifth eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenfunctions of even-even symmetry over a series\nof values a in [0, 2]. We denote by f3 , f4 , f5 the simple curves of those\neigenvalueswith respect to a. The avoided crossings between the pair\n(f3 , f4 ) at approximately .785 and the pair (f4 , f5 ), at about 1.51, are\nevident visually. If one half closes one's eyes it appears that the pairs\ncross. After a closer observation it then appears that the upper curve of\neach pair continues in the same direction its partner was taking before\nthe avoidance, and vice versa.\nThe idea of the work here is to examine the eigenfunctions that correlate with the line curves with particular attention given to contour plots\nnear the avoided crossings to observe how sensitive the data is to the separation values a. The corresponding pairs of contour plots (ee3, ee4, ee5)\nseem to 'swap' characteristics just as the curve pairs tended to take over\neach other's directions.\nJumping across the narrow gap between f4 and f5 the difference between the two eigenfunctions demonstrates a graphical affinity for the\nsubsequent characteristics of ee5 and the previous characteristics of ee4,\nwhile the sum goes the other way (last two contour graphs). In this\npaper we are not drawing any physical conclusions but submit some of\nour graphical results for the reader's inspection.\nAcknowledgement: We wish to thank A. J.
