The total power is proportional to the square of the number of layers and the frequency. Under the small size limitation, the angular distribution is similar to that in the dipole\nemission.

A series of size-dependent intrinsic frequencies are also observed. When the external frequency induced by the external current\nresonates with intrinsic ones, the distinct THz emission is observed.\nPACS numbers: 74.50.+r, 74.25.Gz, 85.25.Cp\n\nHighly\nanisotropic\nhigh-Tc\nsuperconductor\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 (BSCCO) is considered as a stack\nof intrinsic Josephson junctions(IJJs) on atomic scale\n[1, 2]. This materials may provide a new way to generate terahertz (THz) electromagnetic(EM) wave and\ntherefore possibly fills the \"THz gap\"[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\none area of the EM spectrum between microwave and\ninfrared frequencies, which has not yet been exploited.\nThe THz EM-wave emission based on AC Josephson\neffect of IJJs has been detected by Ozyuzer et al. [4],\nand also studied extensively in the theoretical side.\nSome mechanisms of the THz emission have been\nproposed[5, 7] recently. However, these mechanisms can\nnot bridge the big gap for the power in simulations[7]\nand experiments[4, 6].\nIn this paper, we successfully develop a new boundary\nconditions, which explains the dipole angular distribution and predicts that the power is proportional to the\nsquare of layer number and frequency. By solving the\nsine-Gordon equations numerically with a proper boundary conditions, we observe a stable power output in some\nparameter regime. The present power density is in the\nsame order of magnitude as the experimental results. Finally, the detail mechanism is suggested.\nThe plasma frequency of single Josephson junction is in\nsubterahertz wave band. There is a collective cavity resonance mode in the stack of IJJs, which is crucial to enhance the power and to increase the frequency from subTHz to THz. IJJ is formed naturally in BSCCO where\nBi-Sr-O layers between the superconducting CuO2 layers\nacts as a non-conducting barrier.

The abbreviation operator of \u2206(2) is defined\nas \u2206(2) f (l) = f (l + 1) \u2212 2f (l) + f (l \u2212 1).\nIt is known that the boundary conditions are very crucial for the wave emission. The BSCCO source and outside media region are separated by a boundary surface.\nOn the interface, the surface integrals of E and H are\nconstant, except in the red region shown in the Fig. 1. It\nis an effective radiation section where H parallel to y-axis\nand E to x-axis are determined through \u03c6t = 2eDEz /h\u0304\nand \u03c6x = 2\u03c0\u03bc0 DHy /\u03a60 respectively. So the EM-wave\nis described by Maxwell equations outside the BSCCO\nregion and sine-Gordon equations inside the BSCCO region. To evaluate the far field, the original problem could\nbe transformed to an equivalent one described by Love's\nFormulation[10]. In this way, the original IJJ region is\nreplaced by a free space, the BSCCO source is removed,\nand equivalent electric and magnetic currents given below are suspended on the boundary surface,\nJ = n \u00d7 H,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x\u2032 = x/\u03bbc and y \u2032 = x/\u03bbc are the dimensionless\npositions in the a-b plane, t\u2032 = \u03c9p t is the dimensionless\n\u221a\ntime with \u03c9p = c/\u03bbc \u03b5c the Josephson plasma frequency.\nThe current interlayer coupling parameter \u03b6 is described\nas \u03bb2ab /sD, where s and D are the superconducting and\n\nJm = \u2212n \u00d7 E,\nwhere n is an unit vector normal to the effective radiation\nsection, J and Jm are the equivalent sources producing\nthe same E and H in the region outside.

(3) is plotted in Fig. 2\nwith the solid curves. Fig. 2(a) shows the results of\nthe xy model with Lx = 300\u03bcm, Ly = 100\u03bcm. This\nmodel describes the in-phase EM emission from IJJs with\ninfinite junction number. The angular distribution of\nthe Jm has the cylindrical symmetry, and The angular\ndependence of J can be derived from Eq.

Fig. 2(b) shows the radiation in xz-plane of the sample with Lx = 100\u03bcm and\nLz = 0.2\u03bbc . The thickness of the source is much smaller\nthan the wave length. Neglecting the r\u2032 in Eq. (2), the\nPoynting vector is proportional to sin2 \u03b8, the dipole angular distribution. It is the small size of effective radiation\nsection that generates the dipole angular distribution.\n\nBy using a 2D model, Koyama et al [9]. simulated\nthe angular distribution of the radiation energy. Their\nnumerical results are also list in Figs. 2(a) and (b) by\nopen circles. It is very interesting that our analytical\nresults agrees quite well with the simulation ones.\nIt was recently observed that small samples can be\nused to reduce the heating effect, therefore, the small\nsize approach has been generally adopted. When the EM\nradiation from the IJJs is approximately monochromatic\nin THz band, the total power is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nL2y NJ2 \u03c9 2 \u03a620 \u03c62x\n2\nP =\n+ \u03b50 \u03c6t .\n(5)\n96\u03c0 3 c\n\u03bc0\nWhen the change of the cavity resonance is not obvious,\n2\n2\n\u03c6x (\u03c9) and \u03c6t (\u03c9) is constant. Thus Sef\nf \u03c9 /P almost remains unchanged, where Sef f is the area of the effective\nsection. The total power is proportional to the square of\nthe number of layers, consistent with the experimental\nobservations[4].\nThe power of radiation is also simulated with the uses\nof the sine-Gordon equations and Eq. (5). Since the\nmagnetic field of the THz EM wave is much smaller\nthan the external one, the boundary condition can be\nset as \u03c6x\u2032 = H \u2032 , H \u2032 = 2\u03bbc DH[12]. For such a boundary condition, the Poynting vector can not be calculated\ndirectly[13], but Eq. (5) provides another way to the\nevaluation of the power. The parameters used here are\n\u03bbab = 0.4\u03bcm, \u03bbc = 200\u03bcm, s = 0.3nm, D = 1.2nm,\n\u03b2 = 0.02, Lx = 20\u03bcm and Ly = 20\u03bcm. The number\nof junctions is NJ = 30. The power densities obtained\nin the previous simulations[5, 7] are independent of the\neffective section area. Lin et al.[7] estimated the power\ndensity to be around 400W/cm2 , and Tachiki et al.[5]\nabout 3000 W/cm2 . In sharp contrast with the previous\nreports, Eq. (5) shows that the power density is proportional to Sef f . Our effective section area is set to\n0.9\u03bcm2 , close to the experimental value[6]. Fig. 3 shows\nthe external current dependence of the power intensity\nfor the external magnetic field Hext = 2T along the y\naxis. The blue curve denotes the power averaged from\n13.67 ns to 27.34 ns, and the red one from 27.34 ns to\n41.01 ns. Because of the appropriate boundary conditions we employed, our result for the power density is\nmuch smaller than previous numerical ones reported in\nthe literature[5, 7]. The maximum output for the power\ndensity is about 6 W/cm2 , which is just in the same order of magnitude as the experimental result observed by\nBae et al.[6].\nBoth Figs. 3(a) and (b) have been divided into two different regimes, marked with different background colors.\nWhen Jext < 0.47Jc (in the purple regime), the vortices\nare randomly distributed. In general, the power roughly\nincreases with Jext . And if we look into details, it could\nbe found that the blue line and red line do not coincide,\ndue to an unstable power caused by random flux flow.\nWhen Jext > 0.47Jc, the vortex structure is transformed\ninto the in-phase rectangular lattice, a stable configuration. These configurations are discussed analytically by\n\n\f3\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\n(a)\n\n10 + 2\n\n10 - 2\n\n10\n\n+0\n\n10\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\n-4\n\n1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5\nFrequency (THz )\n\n10 - 2\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nKoshelev[14]. In this situation, the distinct power radiation appears. In addition, the output power fluctuates\nwithin the pink regime. This phenomenon is closely related to the radiation mechanism, and will be discussed\nbelow.\nIt is interesting to note that only a small part of the input power, not more than 5%, is able to emit out as EMwave in all previous experiments [4, 6]. Eq. (5) can give\na reasonable explanation to theses experimental findings.\nWhen Ly NJ is small, the interior surfaces reflect a wave\nof low frequencies. The inner EM-wave, generated by AC\nJosephson effect, bounces back and forth within BSCCO.\nLike a cavity resonator, where the EM field forms standing waves, the EM waves with resonance frequencies can\nalso form in BSCCO. Every discrete peak in Fig. 3 provides an evidence of the standing waves. Fig. 3(b) is an\nenlarged view of Fig. 3(a). It is clear that the distances\nbetween neighboring peaks are almost the same. These\npeaks just correspond to the characteristic frequencies\nwith different resonance modes.\nThe different flux-line lattice structures results in the\ndifferent V-I curves and frequency characteristics [11].\nTo understand the resonance mechanism, we analyze the\nfrequency spectra with different external currents. As\nplotted in the Fig. 4(a) and (b), the frequency spectra\nof random lattice is much different from that of the rectangular lattice.\nFig. 4(a) shows the frequency spectra with external\ncurrents Jext = 0.21Jc , 0.22Jc and 0.23Jc . Under these\nconditions, the output power is less than 1% of the maximum. With low Jext , the spectra are not monochromatic\n\n-1\n\n10 - 3\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online).

It\nis also interesting to note that in the three lines for different external currents Jext = 0.21Jc (pink), 0.22Jc(yellow)\nand 0.23Jc(blue), the peaks are in the same frequencies.\nIt follows that these frequencies are intrinsic and independent of the external parameters, such as the external\n\n\f4\nthe experiment[15] . When the external frequency estimated by Eq. (6) equals to one of the intrinsic frequencies, the external current would excite a monochromatic\nresonance mode and the radiation would generate the\nmaximum power, as denoted by the curves a and b. On\nthe other hand, the external current would excite several\nresonance modes, when it is not equal to any intrinsic\nfrequency, as shown by the curve c. The pink regime\nof Fig. (3) shows these resonance peaks with different\nJext . The distance (\u2206Jext ) between two neighbor peaks\nis 0.0098Jc, consistent with the numerical result 0.0093Jc\nbased on intrinsic frequencies.\nFIG. 5: (Color online). The intervals of the intrinsic frequencies. Only one of the parameters(Ns , H, Lx , \u03b6 and \u03b2) is\nchanged in same group of data points.\n\ncurrent, the magnetic field, and so on. The differences\n(\u2206\u03c9) between two neighboring frequencies could be regarded as the characteristic frequencies.\nIn order to clarify these intrinsic frequencies, \u2206\u03c9 is calculated under different Jext , Hext , length, layer number,\nand coupling \u03b6. The results are divided into 5 groups and\ncollected in Fig. 5. The parameters for the same group\nof data are fixed, except that one parameter denoted in\nthe legend of Fig. 5 can be tuned. Because the frequencies are independent of \u03b2 and H, the open circles and\ncrosses with different \u03b2 and H coincide. From this figure, we can observe that all data point can collapse onto\nc\na straight line described by \u2206\u03c9 = L N\u221as\u03b6\u03b5\n. It follows that\nx\n\nr\n\nsc\n, where Ns = NJ + 1 is\nthe intrinsic frequencies is Lnx\u221aN\u03b6\u03b5\nr\nx\nthe number of CuO layers and nx is the natural number.\nThrough observing the simulation data of the inner EM\nfield, it could be found that nx is the number of the standing wave nodes. On possible explanation for these phenomena is the EM resonance between z and x directions.\nThe operator (1 \u2212 \u03b6\u2206(2) ) in Eq. (1) could be regarded as\n(1 \u2212 \u2202z2\u2032 ) with the dimensionless quantity \u221az \u2032 = zef f /\u03bbc ,\nand the effective size zef f = z\u03bbc / (s + D) \u03b6. The resonance occurs when \u03c9/kx = \u03c9z /kef f .\nFor high external current, although the higher harmonics sill exist, the frequency spectra of rectangular lattice\nis almost monochromatic, as shown in Fig. 4(b), close to\n\n[1] R.

The normal current is no longer uniform, which\nresults in periodical perturbation in the inner electric\nfield. Therefore the vortices excite the alternative EM\nfield. When the vortices are in motion, the alternative\nEM field is also propagating and decaying in BSCCO. In\norder to form a stable alternative EM field, the vortices\nand the EM field must move synchronously.\nBy increasing or decreasing the external current, the\nvelocity of the flux flow is also changed. When Jext <\n0.47Jc, the flux flow would move more slowly than the\nEM field. To achieve synchronies along the x-axis, the\nnormal direction of the EM wavefront is not parallel to\nthe flow direction. Because the boundary surface and\nthe wavefront is not tangential, which weakens the power\nemission. On the other hand, when Jext > 0.47Jc, the\nexternal frequency would possibly resonate with the intrinsic frequencies, which pumps considerable energy into\nthe inner alternative EM field. Since the boundary surface is tangential to the wavefront, the power emits much\nmore efficiently.\nThe authors acknowledge useful discussions with X. Hu\nand S. Lin.
