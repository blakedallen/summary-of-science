Introduction\nA Calabi\u2013Yau variety Y is a smooth compact K\u00e4hler manifold with a trivial canonical bundle and\nsuch that H i (Y, OY ) = 0 if 0 < i < dim(Y ). The main conjecture on the families of Calabi\u2013Yau\n3\u2013folds is the mirror symmetry conjecture that, roughly speaking, predicts the existence of a mirror\nfamily for each family of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds. This conjecture is stated for families of Calabi\u2013Yau 3\u2013\nfolds admitting a boundary point with maximal unipotent monodromy, otherwise it is not clear how\nto define the mirror family. For this reason it seems important to construct examples of families of\nCalabi\u2013Yau 3-folds without maximal unipotent monodromy, to describe the variation of their Hodge\nstructures and their parametrizing space and to give explicitly their Picard\u2013Fuchs equations.\nWe recall that an automorphism on a Calabi\u2013Yau Y of dimension n is symplectic if it acts as the\nidentity on the 1-dimensional space H n,0 (Y ), otherwise it is non symplectic. In order to construct a\nCalabi\u2013Yau of a given dimension one can consider the desingularization of certain quotients of products of Calabi\u2013Yau varieties of lower dimension by finite groups of automorphisms. This construction\nis very well known ([B], [CH], [R1], [R2], [V1]). In particular Rohde ([R2]) produces in this way\nfamilies of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds parametrized by Shimura varieties. The Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds considered\nin [R2] are obtained as quotient of the product of a K3 surface and an elliptic curve by the group\nZ/3Z, and both the K3 surface and the elliptic curve considered admit Z/3Z as group of non symplectic automorphisms. In [GvG] the K3 surfaces used in the Rohde's construction are shown to be\ndesingularizations of the quotient of the product of two curves by the group Z/3Z and hence the\nCalabi\u2013Yau 3-folds are desingularizations of the quotient of the product of three curves by the group\n(Z/3Z)2 . This allowed us to determine explicitly the Picard\u2013Fuchs equation of a 1-dimensional family.\nHere we use a similar construction, considering K3 surfaces and elliptic curves admitting non symplectic automorphisms of order 4. The main problem is that there is not yet a complete classification\nof the K3 surfaces admitting a non symplectic automorphism of order 4. However the construction\nused in [GvG] can be considered also in this situation. Indeed we will consider the product of the\nelliptic curve Ei (i.e. the elliptic curve admitting a non symplectic automorphism \u03b1E of order 4 ) with\na curve Cfg of genus g which admits an automorphism \u03b1C acting with eigenvalues i and \u2212i on the\nspace of the holomorphic 1-forms and such that one of the eigenspaces has dimension 1. The quotient\nof the product Ei \u00d7 Cfg by an automorphism obtained from \u03b1E and \u03b1C admits a desingularization\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 14J32, 14J28, 14J50.\nKey words: Calabi\u2013Yau, automorphisms, K3 surfaces, Picard\u2013Fuchs equations.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFAMILIES OF CALABI\u2013YAU 3\u2013FOLDS WITHOUT MAXIMAL UNIPOTENT MONODROMY\n\nwhich is a K3 surface Sfg with a non symplectic automorphism, \u03b1S , of order 4.\nIn sections 2, 3, 4 we construct K3 surfaces with a non symplectic automorphism of order 4 such\nthat its fixed locus and the fixed locus of its square consist of isolated points and rational curves. In\nparticular in Section 2 we construct the K3 surfaces Sfg as quotient of the product of an elliptic curve\nEi and a curve Cfg (described in Section 1) by the group Z/4Z. In Section 3 we describe the family\nQb2 of K3 surfaces as isotrivial fibration with section. In Section 4 we observe that the surfaces Sfg\nadmit a description as 4 : 1 cover of P2 and we construct another family, R, of such a K3 surfaces.\nIn Section 5 we consider the quotient of Ei \u00d7 S by the automorphism \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S , where S is one of\nthe K3 surfaces constructed. This quotient admits a desingularization which is a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold.\nThe main result of the Section 5 is the description of the Hodge structure of this Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold\nand of its variation. In the Section 6 we show that the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of the families have\nno a solution with maximal unipotent monodromy.

The curves Cfg\nIn order to construct K3 surfaces and Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds with a non symplectic automorphism of\norder 4, we introduce the curves Cfg . These curves admit a particular automorphism of order 4 and\nour construction can be done only for certain curves of genus g = 1, 2, 3.\nLet us consider the hyperelliptic curves of genus g\n(1)\n\nCfg : z 2 = rfg (r2 ),\n\ndeg(fg ) = g,\n\nfg without multiple roots.\n\nA basis of the space of the 1-holomorphic forms on Cfg is given by {ra dr/z}0\u2264a\u2264g\u22121 . Set \u03b7C := dr/z,\n\u03c9C := rdr/z and \u03bdC := r2 dr/z.\nThe curve Cfg admits the automorphism \u03b1C : (r, z) \u2192 (\u2212r, iz).\nWe have \u03b1\u2217C (\u03c9C ) = \u2212i\u03c9C , \u03b1\u2217C (\u03b7C ) = i\u03b7C and \u03b1\u2217C (\u03bdC ) = i\u03bdC . In particular the action of \u03b1C on\nH 1,0 (Cfg ) has only i and \u2212i as eigenvalues and one of them has an eigenspace of dimension 1. By\n[vG, Lemma 7.6] the curves admitting an automorphism \u03b1C of order 4 such that its action on the\nspaces of the one holomorphic form has only i and \u2212i as eigenvalues and one eigenspace has dimension\n1, are exactly the curves Cfg given in (1).\nWe observe that if g = 3, the eigenspace of H 1,0 (Cfg ) of dimension 1 is relative to the eigenvalue \u2212i\nand if g = 1, the eigenspace of H 1,0 (Cfg ) of dimension 1 is relative to the eigenvalue i. For this reason\nin the following these two cases are analyzed separately (cf. Sections 2.1, 2.2).\n\n\fALICE GARBAGNATI\n\n3\n\nOne can give a different equation for the curves Cfg , which exhibits them as 4:1 cover of P1 . Indeed\nlet us consider the curves\n(2) Dg : w4 = h2 (t)lg (t)2 ,\n\ng = 1, 2, 3, deg(h2 ) = 2, deg(lg ) = g, h2 lg without multiple roots.\n\nThese curves are 4:1 cover of P1 branched over the zeroes of h2 and of lg . By Riemann\u2013Hurwitz formula, the genus of Dg is g. Of course these curves admit the order 4 automorphism \u03b3D : (w, t) 7\u2192 (iw, t)\nwhich is the cover automorphism.\nIn [vG, Remark 7.7] it is shown that the curves Cf3 and D3 are isomorphic. Let us focus on case\ng = 2. Up to a choice of coordinate of P1 one can assume that the equation of the curve D2 is\nw4 = t(t \u2212 1)2 (t \u2212 \u03bb)2 . The map (w, t) \u2192 r := w2 /((t \u2212 1)(t \u2212 \u03bb)) is a 2 : 1 map D2 \u2192 P1r (this can be\neasily check by writing the divisor associated to the meromorphic function w2 /((t \u2212 1)(t \u2212 \u03bb))). By\nthe definition of r, we find w2 = r(t \u2212 1)(t \u2212 \u03bb) and substituting the new variable r in the equation\nof D2 , we have r2 = t. Thus we find a new equation for D2 , w2 = r(r2 \u2212 1)(r2 \u2212 \u03bb), which is, up to\na choice of coordinates of P1 , the equation of Cf2 . Moreover the cover automorphism \u03b3D induces the\nautomorphism (w, r) 7\u2192 (iw, \u2212r), which is the automorphism \u03b1C on the curve Cf2 .\nThe case g = 1 is very similar. Hence we proved that the curves Cfg endowed with the automorphism\n\u03b1C coincide with the curves Dg endowed with the automorphism \u03b3D .\nWe recall the following result on moduli space of the curves Cfg :\nProposition 1.1. (cf. [vG]) The curves Cfg are parametrized by the symmetric domain U (1, g \u2212\n1)/(U (1) \u00d7 U (g \u2212 1)) \u2243 Bg\u22121 := {w \u2208 Cg\u22121 | ||w|| \u2264 1} .\n2. The K3 surfaces Sfg with a non symplectic automorphism of order 4.\nIn this section we construct the K3 surfaces Sfg , which are the desingularization of the quotient of\nproduct of the elliptic curve Ei (the elliptic curve with a non symplectic automorphism of order 4)\nand the curve Cfg by an automorphism of order 4. We first consider the case g = 1 and after that the\nother two cases because the choice of the automorphism of order 4 depends on the eigenvalues relative\nto the eigenspace with dimension 1.\n2.1. Case g = 1: a K3 surface described by Shioda and Inose. The curve Cfg , in case g = 1,\nis the elliptic curve Ei . We recall a construction presented in [SI] which produces a K3 surface as\nquotient of the product surface Ei \u00d7 Ei \u2243 Ei \u00d7 Cf1 .\nLet Ei be the curve v 2 = u(u2 + 1) and \u03b1E be the automorphism \u03b1E : (u, v) 7\u2192 (\u2212u, iv).\nA generator of H 1,0 (Ei ) is \u03b7E := du/v and we observe that \u03b1\u2217E (\u03b7E ) = i\u03b7E .\nThe surface (Ei \u00d7 Ei )/\u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1E is a singular surface and its desingularization is a K3 surface, described\nin [SI, Lemma 5.2]. Here we give explicitly the quotient map.\nLet the coordinates of the first copy of Ei be (u1 , v1 ) and the coordinates of the second copy of Ei be\n(u2 , v2 ). Let us consider the surface defined by the equation\n(3)\n\ny 2 = x3 + t3 (t + 1)2 x.\n\nWe observe that u1 v22 u22 , v1 v23 u32 , u22 are invariant under the action of \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1E .

The K3 surface XSI , desingularization of the surface\ndefined by the equation (3), has Picard number 20 and hence its moduli space is zero dimensional.\nThe surface with equation (3) admits an automorphism (x, y, t) \u2192 (\u2212x, iy, t) (induced by \u03b1E \u00d7 1C ),\nwhich extends to a non symplectic automorphism \u03b1X of XSI such that \u03b1X (\u03b7X ) = i\u03b7X , where \u03b7X is\na generator of H 2,0 (XSI ). The transcendental lattice of XSI is isometric to the lattice h2i2 (cf. [SI]).\n2.2. The cases g = 2, 3. In the following we will denote by H a,b (Cfg )\u03bb the eigenspace of H a,b (Cfg )\nfor the eigenvalue \u03bb with respect to the action of \u03b1C on H a,b (Cfg ) and by H a,b (Sfg )\u03bb the eigenspace\nof H a,b (Sfg ) for the eigenvalue \u03bb with respect to the action of \u03b1S (cf.

[Mi, Table IV.3.1]): we have one singularity of type A1 over s = 0,\ng singularities of type D4 over the zeroes of fg (s) and one singularity over s = \u221e which is either of\ntype E7 if g = 2 or of type A1 if \u0001g = 3. These singularities are A-D-E singularities, hence there exists\na desingularization of Ei \u00d7 Cfg / (\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1C ) which is a K3 surface.\n\u0001\nDefinition 2.1. Let Sfg be the desingularization of Ei \u00d7 Cfg / (\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1C ) and let \u03b1S be the automorphism induced on Sfg by the automorphism \u03b1E on Ei .\nThe automorphism \u03b1S is \u03b1S : (x, y, s) 7\u2192 (\u2212x, iy, s). Since H 2,0 (Sfg ) = C\u03b7S , with \u03b7S = \u03b7E \u2227 \u03c9C ,\n\u03b1S (\u03b7S ) acts on H 2,0 (Sfg ) as a multiplication by i.\n3\nRemark 2.1. In case g = 1, 2 one can also consider the quotient Rfg := (Ei \u00d7 Cf^\ng )/(\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1C ) which\n2\n3\n3\n2\nadmits an equation of the form y = x + xs fg (s) . The quotient map generalizes the one considered\nin the previous section and is\n\n((u; v); (z; r)) \u2192 (x := uz 2 r2 ; y := vz 3 r3 , s := r2 ).\nIn case g = 1, Rf1 = XSI , in case g = 2, the desingularization of Rf2 is isomorphic to Sf2 (it suffices\nto perform on P1s the automorphism s 7\u2192 1/s).\nProposition 2.2. For a generic choice of the polynomial fg , the K3 surface Sfg admits an elliptic\nfibration with one fiber of type III (two tangent rational curves) over s = 0, g fibers of type I0\u2217 (with\nf4 ) over the zeroes of fg (s) and one reducible fiber over infinity which is either of type\ndual graph D\n\u2217\nf7 ) if g = 2, or of type III if g = 3. This fibration has no sections of infinite\nIII (with dual graph E\norder, has a section of order 2, \u03c3, and a rational curve \u03b2 as bisection.\n\n\fALICE GARBAGNATI\n\n5\n\n\u0001\nProof. The equation (5) of E is the equation of the quotient surface Ei \u00d7 Cfg / (\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1C ). The\ndesingularization of E gives an elliptic fibration with the singular fibers described (cf. [Mi, Table\nIV.3.1]).\nThe equation of E can be written as wy 2 = x3 + xw2 sfg (s)2 . With these coordinates the zero section\nis O : s \u2192 (x(s):y(s):w(s)) = (0:1:0) and Sfg admits a section of order 2, \u03c3 : s 7\u2192 (0:0:1). Moreover\nit is clear that the fibration on Sfg admits a bisection \u03b2 with equation x2 = \u2212sfg (s)2 . This is a 2:1\ncover of P1 branched over s = 0 and s = \u221e, hence \u03b2 is a rational curve.\nWe have now to prove that there are no sections with infinite order.\nThe trivial lattice (i.e. the lattice generated by the class of the section O and by the classes of the\nirreducible components of reducible fibers) of this elliptic fibration on Sfg has rank equal to 18 if g = 2\nand to 16 if g = 3. Hence the rank of the transcendental lattice TSfg of Sfg is\n\u001a\n4 if g = 2,\nrank(TSfg ) \u2264\n(6)\n.\n6 if g = 3\nThe family of curves Cfg has g \u2212 1 moduli (fg has g zeroes, and one of them can be chosen to be\n1, so there are g \u2212 1 free zeroes of fg ) and since Ei is rigid, the surface Sfg has g \u2212 1 moduli. All\nthe members of the family admit \u03b1S as non symplectic automorphisms of order 4. The moduli of a\nfamily of K3 surfaces admitting a non symplectic automorphism of order 4 is rank(T )/2 \u2212 1, where\nT is the transcendental lattice. Since the family Sfg is at least a subfamily of the family of K3\nsurfaces admitting a non symplectic automorphism of order 4, the number of moduli of Sfg is at most\nrank(TSfg )/2 \u2212 1, hence\n\u001a\nrank(TSfg )\n1 if g = 2\n\u22121\u2265\n(7)\n.\n2 if g = 3\n2\nComparing (6) and (7) one obtains that rank(TSfg ) = g \u2212 1. In particular this implies that the rank\nof the N\u00e9ron Severi group of Sfg is the same as the rank of the trivial lattice of the elliptic fibration\n\u0003\non Sfg and hence there are no sections of infinite order.\nRemark 2.3. Since the classes of the irreducible components of the reducible fibers and of the sections\nof an elliptic fibration generate the N\u00e9ron Severi group of the surface, one can directly compute the\ndiscriminant form of the N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group of each of these K3 surfaces. By this computation one\ndeduces that the transcendental lattice of Sf3 is isometric to U (2)2 \u2295 h\u22122i2 and the transcendental\nlattice of Sf2 is isometric to U (2) \u2295 h2i \u2295 h\u22122i.\n2.3. The order 4 non symplectic automorphism on Sfg .\nProposition 2.4. In the case g = 2, the fixed locus of \u03b1S is made up of 3 rational curves and 10\npoints and the fixed locus of \u03b12S is made up of 8 rational curves (3 of them are fixed by \u03b1S , the others\nare invariant for \u03b1S ).\nIn the case g = 3, the fixed locus of \u03b1S is made up of 2 rational curves and 8 points and the fixed locus\nof \u03b12S is made up of 6 rational curves (2 of them are fixed by \u03b1S , the others are invariant for \u03b1S ).\nProof. The fixed locus of \u03b12S . The automorphism \u03b12S is a non symplectic involution on a K3 surface,\nhence its fixed locus is either empty or made up of disjoint curves (cf. [N2]). The sections O and \u03c3\nand the bisection \u03b2 are fixed rational curves.\nWe now describe the action of \u03b12S on the irreducible components of the reducible fibers. We will call\nC0i the component of the i-th reducible fiber which meets the zero section. For the fibers of type III\nwe call C1i the other component.\nThe 2-torsion section meets the fibers of type III in the component C1 . The component C0 (resp.\nC1 ) meets the zero section (resp. the section \u03c3), which is a fixed curve and hence cannot be fixed (the\nfixed locus consists of disjoint curves). The point of intersection of C0 and C1 is fixed, but since the\nfixed locus does not contain isolated fixed points, this point is on the bisection \u03b2 (one can also directly\ncheck that the bisection \u03b2 meets the two rational curves of the fiber in their intersection point).\n\n\f6\n\nFAMILIES OF CALABI\u2013YAU 3\u2013FOLDS WITHOUT MAXIMAL UNIPOTENT MONODROMY\n\nThe fibers of type I0\u2217 are made up of five rational curves with the following configuration:\n\u275d\nC3\nC0\n\u275d\n\nC2\n\u275d\n\u275dC1\n\n\u275d\nC4\n\nThe section O meets the component C0 , the section \u03c3 the component C1 and the bisection \u03b2 the\ncomponents C3 and C4 . Since the fixed locus is smooth, one obtains that the components Ci , i =\n0, 1, 3, 4 are invariant, but they are not pointwise fixed. The points of intersection of C2 with the\ncurves Ci , i = 0, 1, 3, 4 are fixed and hence C2 is pointwise fixed.\nThe fiber of type III \u2217 is made up of eight rational curves with the following configuration:\nC0\n\u275d\n\nC1\n\u275d\n\nC2\n\u275d\n\nC3\n\u275d\n\nC4\n\u275d\n\nC5\n\u275d\n\nC6\n\u275d\n\n\u275dC7\nThe section O meets C0 , \u03c3 meets C6 and the bisection \u03b2 is tangent to C7 . Arguing as before one\nconcludes that the components C1 , C3 , C5 are pointwise fixed, the others are invariant but not fixed.\nSo the curves fixed by \u03b12S are: O, \u03c3, \u03b2, the components C2 on each fibers of type I0\u2217 and, if g = 2, the\ncomponents Cj , j = 1, 3, 5 on the fiber of type III \u2217 .\nFixed locus of \u03b1S . The sections O and \u03c3 are fixed by \u03b1S . The bisection \u03b2 is invariant, but not fixed.\nSince it is a rational curve, the restriction of \u03b1S on it has two fixed points: these are the points of\nintersection of \u03b2 with the reducible fibers over s = 0 and s = \u221e (i.e. on the fibers which are not of\ntype I0\u2217 ). Thus the two points of intersection of \u03b2 with each fibers of type I0\u2217 are switched by \u03b1S and\nhence on the fiber of type I0\u2217 the components C3 and C4 are switched, so C2 can not be pointwise\nfixed but the intersection points between C2 and the components C0 and C1 are fixed.\nOn the fiber of type III \u2217 the point of intersection of C7 and \u03b2 is a fixed point. The component C3\nis pointwise fixed and the components C1 and C5 are invariant. It is possible that they are either\npointwise fixed or invariant but not pointwise fixed. To understand which case occurs we consider the\nLefschetz fixed point formula:\nX\n\u03c7(F ix\u03b1S (S)) =\n(\u22121)r trace(\u03b1S |H r (S,C) ),\nr\n\nwhere F ix\u03b1S (S) is the fixed locus of \u03b1S on S and \u03c7 is the topological Euler characteristic.\nHere we are in case g = 2 (because for g = 3 there is no fiber of type III \u2217 ). From the description of\n(2)\n(2)\n(3)\n(3)\n\u03b1S it is clear that \u03b1S acts with eigenvalue \u22121 on the classes C3 \u2212 C4 and C3 \u2212 C4 (assuming\nthat the second and the third fibers are the fibers of type I0\u2217 ) and acts trivially on the other classes in\nthe N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group. Hence the eigenspace for the eigenvalue \u22121 on N S(Sf2 ) \u2297 C has dimension\n2 and the eigenspace for the eigenvalue 1 has dimension 16. Moreover \u03b1S acts as the multiplication\nby i on the period \u03b7Sf2 , so it acts with eigenvalue i on a 2-dimensional subspace of TS \u2297 C and with\neigenvalue \u2212i on the orthogonal 2-dimensional subspaces of TS \u2297 C (cf. [N1]). The action of \u03b1S on\nH 0 (Sf2 , C) and on H 4 (Sf2 , C) is trivial and H 1 (Sf2 C) = H 3 (Sf2 , C) = 0 since Sf2 is a K3 surface.\nHence the right side in the Lefschetz fixed point formula is 1 + 16 + 2(\u22121) + 2i + 2(\u2212i) + 1 = 16.\nWe recall that the Euler characteristic\nis\u00112. By\nthe description\n\u0011\n\u0011 `of\u0010a`point is\u0011 1 and of a rational\u0010curve\n\u0010`\n` \u0010`3\n`10\n5\n6\n)\n=\n(S\nor\nF\nix\np\nC\nof \u03b1S either F ix\u03b1S (Sf2 ) =\np\nf2\n\u03b1S\nj=1 Cj where\ni=1 i\nj=1 j\ni=1 i\n\u0011\n\u0011 ` \u0010`\n\u0010`\n3\n10\nand\npi are points and Cj are rational curves. It follows that F ix\u03b1S (Sf2 ) =\nC\np\nj\ni\nj=1\ni=1\n\u2217\nhence the components C1 and C5 on the fiber of type III are not pointwise fixed.\nTo recap, if g = 2 the fixed locus of \u03b1S is made up of 3 rational curves (O, \u03c3, and the component C3\n\n\fALICE GARBAGNATI\n\n7\n\non the fiber of type III \u2217 ), and 10 points (1 on the fiber of type III, 2 on each fiber of type I0\u2217 and 5\non the fiber of type III \u2217 ); if g = 3 the fixed locus of \u03b1S is made up of 2 rational curves (O, \u03c3), and 8\npoints (1 on each fiber of type III and 2 on each fiber of type I0\u2217 ).\n\u0003\nIn (4) we computed the invariant part of H 2,0 (Ei \u00d7 Cfg ) and H 1,1 (Ei \u00d7 Cfg ) under \u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1C .\nThese spaces pass to the quotient. In the previous proposition we calculated explicitly the action\nof \u03b1S on \u0001the curves Cij , which are the curves arising from the resolution of the singular quotient\nEi \u00d7 Cfg / (\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1C ).

The previous computation can also be applied to the surface XSI . By the description\nof the action of the non symplectic automorphism \u03b1S on the singular fibers of the fibrations on Sfg\none deduces the properties of the fixed locus of automorphism \u03b1X : \u03b1X fixes 4 rational curves (one for\neach fiber of type III \u2217 , the zero sections and the 2-torsion section) and 12 points (5 on each fibers of\ntype III \u2217 and 2 on the fiber of type I0\u2217 ), and \u03b12X fixes 10 rational curves (4 of them are fixed by \u03b1X ,\nthe other are invariant for \u03b1X ). Moreover one can describe explicitly the eigenspaces for the action\n\u0003\nof \u03b1X on H 2 (XSI , Z) as done for the surfaces Sfg .\n3. Isotrivial fibrations with section and the family Qb2 of K3 surfaces\nIn the previous section we described K3 surfaces admitting an isotrivial fibration with section such\nthat the smooth fibers are isomorphic to Ei . Each such a fibration has a minimial Weierstrass equation\nof type y 2 = x3 + xa(t, s) where a(t, s) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 8 and the maximal\nmultiplicity of its zeroes is 3 (the conditions on the degree and on the multiplicity of the zeroes\nguarantee that the elliptic fibration is a K3 surface, [Mi]).\nDefinition 3.1. Let Qa be the K3 surface defined by y 2 = x3 + xa(t, s) and \u03b1Q be the automorphism\ninduced by the automorphism \u03b1E acting on the fibers, i.e. \u03b1Q : (x, y, t, s) 7\u2192 (\u2212x, iy, t, s).\nIn order to construct families of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds without maximal unipotent monodromy, we require\nthat \u03b1Q and its powers do not fix curves of positive genus. As in previous section one observes that\nthe fixed loci of \u03b1Q and \u03b12Q are made up of points, components of the reducible fibers (which are\nalways rational curves), the zero section, the torsion section \u03c3:(t:s) 7\u2192 (0, 0, (t:s)) (these are rational\ncurves) and the bisection x2 = a(t, s). Hence \u03b1Q and \u03b12Q fix only points and rational curves if and\nonly if x2 = a(t, s) is not a curve of positive genus. If a(t, s) is not a square, then x2 = a(t, s) is a\nhyperelliptic curve and its genus depends on the zeroes with an odd multiplicity of the polynomial\na(t, s). Recalling that the maximum degree of a zero in a(t, s) is 3 one sees that there are only 3\npossibilities for a(t, s), which correspond to the surfaces XSI , Sf2 and Sf3 constructed in previous\nsections.\nThe only other possibility is that a(t, s) = b2 (t, s) where b(t, s) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree\n\nif g = 2\nif g = 3\n\nif g = 2\nif g = 3\n\n\f8\n\nFAMILIES OF CALABI\u2013YAU 3\u2013FOLDS WITHOUT MAXIMAL UNIPOTENT MONODROMY\n\n4 without multiple roots. In this case the bisection x2 = a(t, s) splits in the union of two sections,\nwhich are rational curves since the base curve of the fibration is P1 . Thus we have another family Qb2\nof K3 surfaces.\nProposition 3.1. Let E be the elliptic curve E : v 2 = b(t, s), deg(b) = 4, and let \u03b9E be the automorphism \u03b9E : (v, t, s) 7\u2192 (\u2212v, t, s). The desingularization of the product (Ei \u00d7 E)/(\u03b12E \u00d7 \u03b9E ) is the K3\nsurface Qb2 admitting the isotrivial elliptic fibration y 2 = x3 + xb2 (t, s).\nThis fibration has four fibers of type I0\u2217 and three 2-torsion sections.\nThe automorphism \u03b1Q fixes 2 rational curves and 8 points, the automorphism \u03b12Q fixes 8 rational\ncurves (2 of them are fixed by \u03b1Q , 4 are invariant for \u03b1Q and 2 are switched by \u03b1Q ).\nProof. The proof is similar to the ones of Propositions 2.2 and 2.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.2. The transcendental lattice of Qb2 is isometric to U (2) \u2295 U (2) (cf. Remark 2.3).\n4. The 4 : 1 covers of P2 and the family R of K3 surfaces\nWe discuss a different projective model for the K3 surfaces Sfg (Proposition 4.1) and give another\nfamily R of K3 surfaces (Proposition 4.2) which admits a similar model.\nIn [A] a one dimensional family of K3 surfaces Z admitting a non symplectic automorphism is constructed as 4:1 cover of P2 branched along a quartic which is the intersection of a conic and two\nlines. In [A, Proposition 3.1] it is proved that this family admits an isotrivial fibration with general\nfiber isomorphic to Ei and the equation of the curve B which trivializes the fibration is given. In\nother words the curve B described in [A] is a curve such that there exists a finite group G such that\nthe desingularization of (B \u00d7 Ei )/G is the K3 surface Z. From the proof of [A, Proposition 3.1]\nit is evident that the curve B is the curve Cf2 and the group G is Z/4Z which acts on Ei \u00d7 Cf2\nas described in the Section 2.2. So the one dimesional family of surfaces which are 4:1 cover of P2\nbranched along a conic and two lines is the family Sf2 . Moreover, the non symplectic automorphism\ndescribed in the Section 2.3 is the automorphism of order 4 associated to the 4:1 cover of P2 . We\nobserve that the automorphism associated to the cover has to fix the three rational curves which are\nin the branch locus. Moreover it fixes 10 points. Indeed, to obtain a smooth model of the 4:1 cover\nof P2 , one has to blow up the singular points of the branch quartic, introducing three rational curves\nwith an A3 configuration for each singular points. The intersection points between the curves of each\nA3 configuration are fixed by the automorphism. Since the branch quartic has 5 singular points, the\nautomorphism has 10 fixed points. The square of this automorphism fixes the rational curves fixed\nby the automorphism, and the central components of the curves in the A3 configuration.\nHere we prove that also the surfaces XSI and Sf3 admit a similar description.\nProposition 4.1. The 2-dimensional family of K3 surfaces which are 4:1 covers of P2 branched along\nthe union of two conics in general position is the family Sf3 . The K3 surface which is the 4:1 cover\nof P2 branched along the union of four lines in general position is the surface XSI .\nProof. Up to a choice of the coordinates of P2 one can assume that the intersection between two conics\nare the points (1 : 0 : 0), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 0 : 1), (1 : 1 : 1). So one can always assume that the K3\nsurface which is the 4 : 1 cover of P2 branched along two conics is the 2-dimensional family\ns4 = (x1 x2 + ax2 x3 + (a \u2212 1)x1 x3 )(x1 x2 + bx2 x3 + (b \u2212 1)x1 x3 ).\nIf we now consider the pencil of lines through (0 : 0 : 1), i.e. x2 = \u03bbx1 , this gives a pencil of elliptic\ncurves on the surface with j-invariant equal to 1728 (i.e. an isotrivial fibration on the surface with\ngeneric fiber isomorphic to Ei ). To trivialize this fibration we consider the intersection of the pencil\nwith the branch quartic and we put x1 = 1, so the equation of the surface becomes\ns4 = (\u03bb + a\u03bbx3 + (a \u2212 1)x3 )(\u03bb + b\u03bbx3 + (b \u2212 1)x3 ).\nNow we have that\n(x3 \u2212 h)(x3 \u2212 k) =\n\n1\n1\n1\n(h \u2212 k)2 (z 2 \u2212 1), where z is such that x3 = (h \u2212 k)z + (h + k),\n4\n2\n2\n\n\fALICE GARBAGNATI\n\nso putting h =\n\n\u03bb\na\u03bb+a\u22121\n\nand k =\n\ns4 = (a\u03bb + a \u2212 1)(b\u03bb + b \u2212 1)\n\n\u03bb\nb\u03bb+b\u22121\n\n9\n\none obtains\n\n\u03bb2 (\u03bb + 1)2 (b \u2212 a)2\n\u03bb2 (\u03bb + 1)2 (b \u2212 a)2\n(z 2 \u2212 1) =\n(z 2 \u2212 1).\n2\n2\n4(a\u03bb + a \u2212 1) (b\u03bb + b \u2212 1)\n4(a\u03bb + a \u2212 1)(b\u03bb + b \u2212 1)\n\nConsidering the base change B(\u03c1,\u03bb) 7\u2192 P2\u03bb with\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03bb2 (\u03bb + 1)2 (b \u2212 a)2\n4\nB(\u03c1,\u03bb) := \u03c1 =\n4(a\u03bb + a \u2212 1)(b\u03bb + b \u2212 1)\nand the change of coordinates \u03c4 :=\n\n\u03bb(\u03bb+1)(b\u2212a)1/2\n\u03c1(4ab)1/4\n\none obtains that the trivializing curve B(\u03c4,\u03bb) is\n\nb\na\n, b\u2032 :=\n.\na\u22121\nb\u22121\nThis is the curve Cf3 with the equation given in (2) (assuming that one zero of l2 is at infinity). So the\nsurfaces which are 4 : 1 cover of P2 branched along a conic and two lines are the quotient of Ei \u00d7 Cf3\nby the automorphism ((s, z), (\u03c4, \u03bb)) 7\u2192 ((is, z), (\u2212i\u03c4, \u03bb)), hence the family of K3 surfaces which admits\nsuch a 4:1 cover of P2 is Sf3 .\nThe proof in the case the branch locus is made up of four lines is very similar. We only observe that\nthe equation of the surface is s4 = x1 x3 (x1 \u2212 x3 )(x2 \u2212 x3 ).\n\u0003\n\u03c4 4 = \u03bb2 (\u03bb + 1)2 (\u03bb \u2212 a\u2032 )(\u03bb \u2212 b\u2032 ), where a\u2032 :=\n\nProposition 4.2. There exists a 3-dimensional family of K3 surfaces R which are 4 : 1 covers of P2\nbranched along a quartic curve with three nodes. All the K3 surfaces in this family admit an isotrivial\nfibration with generic fiber isomorphic to Ei and the order four automorphism, \u03b1R , induced on R by\n\u03b1E is the cover automorphism. The automorphism \u03b1R fixes 1 rational curve (the branch curve) and 6\npoints, the automorphism \u03b12Q fixes 4 rational curves (1 of them is fixed by \u03b1R , the others are invaraint\nfor \u03b1R ).\nProof. It is well known that the 4 : 1 cover of P2 branched over a quartic curve with at most A-D-E\nsingularities admits a desingularization which is a K3 surface. It is immediate to check that, up to\nan automorphism of P2 , the irreducible plane quartic curves with three nodes are V (x21 x22 + x21 x23 +\nx22 x23 + ax21 x2 x3 + bx1 x22 x3 + cx1 x2 x23 ). Thus the family of R is 3-dimensional. The equation of the\n4 : 1 cover is s4 = x21 x22 + x21 x23 + x22 x23 + ax21 x2 x3 + bx1 x22 x3 + cx1 x2 x23 and the cover automorphism is\n\u03b1R : (s, x1 , x2 , x3 ) 7\u2192 (is, x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ). The generic line of the pencil x2 = \u03bbx1 intersects the quartic\nin the node (0 : 0 : 1) and in two other points. This pencil of lines exhibits an elliptic fibration on R\nwith general fiber isomorphic to an elliptic curve with j invariant equal to 1728 (we put x2 = 1):\n!!\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0001\n(a + b\u03bb)\n2\n2\n4\n2\n+1\n.\nx3 \u2212 \u03bb\n(9)\ns = 1 + c\u03bb + c\u03bb\n2(1 + c\u03bb + c\u03bb2 )\n\nFor almost every values of \u03bb the Equation (9) gives an elliptic curve isomorphic to Ei with a non\nsymplectic automorphism of order 4 (s, x3 ) \u2192 (is, x3 ), so \u03b1E induces exactly \u03b1R . The fixed locus can\n\u0003\nbe computed as in case Sf2 .\nIn particular there exists a curve B and a finite group G of automorphism of B \u00d7 Ei such that R is a\ndesingularization of (B \u00d7 Ei ) /G.\nThe family of K3 surfaces admitting a non symplectic involution fixing four rational curves is a 6dimensional family and the transcendental lattice of a generic member of this family is isomorphic to\nU (2)2 \u2295 h\u22122i4 (cf. [N2]). It is the eigenspace T of the eigenvalue \u22121 for the actions of the involution\non H 2 . If the non symplectic involution is the square of a non symplectic automorphism of order\n4, the space T splits in the sum of the two 4-dimensional eigenspaces of the eigenvalues i and \u2212i\nfor the action of the automorphims of order 4 on H 2 . The H 2,0 of a member of this family lives in\none of these two eigenspaces and we can assume it lives in the eigenspace of the eigenvalue i. Hence\nthe family of K3 surfaces admitting a non symplectic automorphism of order 4 whose square fixes\nfour rational curves, has dimension 4 \u2212 1 = 3 and the transcendental lattice of a general member\nis isomorphic to U (2)2 \u2295 h\u22122i4 . Since R is a 3-dimensional family of K3 surfaces admitting an\nautomorphism \u03b1R of order 4 such that \u03b12R fixes four rational curves, these two families coincide and\n\n\f10\n\nFAMILIES OF CALABI\u2013YAU 3\u2013FOLDS WITHOUT MAXIMAL UNIPOTENT MONODROMY\n\nthe transcendental lattice of R, TR , is isomorphic to U (2)2 \u2295 h\u22122i4 . By [N2], \u03b12R acts as the identity\non the N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group of the surface and as \u22121 on the transcendental lattice. Since \u03b1R acts on\nH 2,0 (R) as a multiplication by i, the eigenspace H 2 (R, C)i of the eigenvalue i for \u03b1R decomposes in\nH 2,0 (R) \u2295 H 1,1 (R)i and has dimension 4, as said before. Similarly the eigenspace H 2 (R, C)\u2212i has\ndimension 4 and decomposes in H 0,2 (R) \u2295 H 1,1 (R)\u2212i . The sum of the eigenspaces with eigenvalues\n+1 and \u22121 is N S(R) \u2297 C. Let x be the dimension of the invariant sublattice of H 1,1 (R) for \u03b1R , and\nso 14 \u2212 x is the dimension of the anti-invariant sublattice of H 1,1 (R). Let C be the rational curve and\npi be the six points fixed by \u03b1R . By the Lefschetz fixed point formula we obtain:\n!\n!\n6\na \u0010a \u0011\na\nC\n= 1 + x + (14 \u2212 x)(\u22121) + 4i + 4(\u2212i) + 1 = \u221212 + 2x.\npi\n8=\u03c7\ni=1\n\nSo x = 4. Thus the dimensions of the eigenspaces of H 2 (R, Q) for the action of \u03b1R are:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= dim(H 1,1 (R)\u22121 ) = 4,\ndim H 2 (R, C)\u22121\ndim H 2 (R, C)i \u0001= dim(H 2,0 (R) \u2295 H 1,1 (R)i ) = 4,\n\u0001\n2,0\n1,1\n2\n2\ndim H (R, C)\u2212i = dim(H (R) \u2295 H (R)\u2212i ) = 4, dim H (R, C)1 = dim(H 1,1 (R)1 ) = 10.\n\nRemark 4.3. In [N2] it is proved that the families of K3 surfaces admitting a non symplectic involution fixing k rational curves, k = 10, 8, 6, 4, is (10 \u2212 k)-dimensional and the generic member of\neach of these families has transcendental lattice isometric to U (2) if k = 10, either to U (2)\u22952 or to\nU (2) \u2295 h2i \u2295 h\u22122i if k = 8, to U (2)\u22952 \u2295 h\u22122i\u22952 if k = 6, to U (2)\u22952 \u2295 h\u22122i4 if k = 4. For each of these\nfamilies we constructed a ((10 \u2212 k)/2)-dimensional subfamily admitting an automorphism of order 4\nwhose square is the involution fixing k rational curves.\n5. Families of Calabi Yau 3-folds.\nOnce one has a family of K3 surfaces with a non symplectic automorphism of order 4 such that its\nfixed locus and the fixed locus of its square consist of rational curves and points, one can construct\nCalabi\u2013Yau 3-folds as quotient of the product of these K3 surfaces with the elliptic curve Ei . In the\nprevious section we constructed some families of K3 surfaces with the required automorphism. In\nSection 5.1 we construct families of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds Yfg considering the families of K3 surfaces\nSfg , giving all the details. The construction in the other two cases (starting with the families of K3\nsurfaces Qb2 and R) is very similar and is presented in sections 5.2 and 5.3.\n\u0001\n\u0001\n5.1.

We will denote the exceptional divisor on a\ncurve F as Fe .\n3^ 2\nLet Zfg be the quotient of E^\ni \u00d7 Sfg by (\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1S ) . This is a smooth 3-fold, and the quotient map\n^\n^\n^\n^\nE^\ni \u00d7 Sfg \u2192 Zfg is a 2:1 cover ramified on Pi \u00d7 Cj , Pi \u00d7 Dj , Qi \u00d7 Cj , Qi \u00d7 Dj . We have the following\ncommutative diagram:\nE^\ni \u00d7 Sfg\n\u2193\n^\n\u2190 (Ei \u00d7 Sfg )/\u03b12E \u00d7 \u03b12S \u2243 Zfg\n\u2190\n\nEi \u00d7 Sfg\n\u2193\n(Ei \u00d7 Sfg )/\u03b12E \u00d7 \u03b12S\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere (Ei \u00d7 S^\nfg )/\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1S is the desingularization the quotient of (Ei \u00d7 Sfg )/\u03b1E \u00d7 \u03b1S .\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nStep 3: the desingularization of the quotient Ei \u00d7 Sfg / \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S . The automorphism \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S\ninduces an automorphism of order 2, \u03b1Z , on Zfg . Since (\u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S )(Q1 \u00d7 Cj ) = Q2 \u00d7 Cj and (\u03b13E \u00d7\n^\n\u03b1S )(Q1 \u00d7 Dj ) = Q2 \u00d7 Dj , the divisors Q^\ni \u00d7 Cj and Qi \u00d7 Dj are not invariant and in particular there\n^\nare no elements in the fixed locus on these divisors. The divisors P^\ni \u00d7 Cj and Pi \u00d7 Dj are \u03b1Z -invariant.\nSince \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S fixes two points on Pi \u00d7 Dj , \u03b1Z fixes two fibers in the P1 -bundle P^\ni \u00d7 Dj (the fibers\nover the fixed points). These fibers are clearly two rational curves.\nThe involution \u03b1Z fixes the bases of the P1 -bundles P^\ni \u00d7 Cj and acts non trivially on the fibers. Since\nthe fibers are rational curves, \u03b1Z fixes two points on each fiber, so it fixes two sections on P^\ni \u00d7 Cj .\nThe base of the bundles P^\ni \u00d7 Cj are the rational curves Pi \u00d7 Cj , thus the sections of these bundles\nare rational curves. Hence \u03b1Z fixes 4dg + 4cg rational curves on Zfg .\ng\nfZ be the automorphism induced by \u03b1Z\nLet Z\nfg be the blow up of Zfg in the fixed locus of \u03b1Z , let \u03b1\ng\ng\ng\nf\nfZ on Zfg is smooth of codimension 1, hence Yfg := Z\non Zfg .

Putting together the two quotients of\norder 2 one obtains:\nEi \u00d7 Sfg\n\u2193\n(Ei \u00d7 Sfg )/\u03b12E \u00d7 \u03b12S\n\n\u2190\n\u2190\n\nE^\ni \u00d7 Sfg\n\u2193\nZfg\n\u2193\nZfg /\u03b1Zfg\n\ng\nZ\nfg\n\u2193\n\u2190 Z^\nfg /\u03b1Z \u2243 Yfg\n\u2190\n\nwhich shows that Yfg is a desingularization of the quotient Ei \u00d7 Sfg by \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S .\nStep 4: the Hodge numbers h2,1 and h1,1 . Let A be a K\u00e4hler 3-fold admitting a finite automorphism\ne be the blow up of A along the fixed locus of\n\u03c6 fixing a finite set of points and of disjoint curves. Let A\ne\ne\ne by [V2,\n\u03c6 and \u03c6 be the automorphism induced on A by \u03c6. We can compute the Hodge structure of A\ne\ne depends only on\nTh\u00e9or\u00e8m 7.31]. The \u03c6-invariant\npart for the action of \u03c6e on the Hodge structure of A\nthe \u03c6-invariant part of the Hodge structure of A and on the Hodge structure of the fixed locus (cf.\n[R1, Proposition 10.3.2]). In particular, if the fixed locus of \u03c6 is made up of r disjoint rational curves,\none obtains:\n(12)\n\ne Z)1 \u2243 H 2 (A, Z)1 \u2295 H 0 (B, Z)\nH 2 (A,\n\ne Z)1 \u2243 H 3 (A, Z)1 \u2295 H 1 (B, Z).\nand H 3 (A,\n\n\fALICE GARBAGNATI\n\n13\n\ne = dim(H 2 (A,\ne \u03c6)\ne Z)1 ) = h2 (A) + r and\nSince H 0 (B, Z) = Zr and H 1 (B, Z) = 0 we obtain that h2 (A/\ne = dim(H 3 (A,\ne \u03c6)\ne Z)1 ) = h3 (A). Recalling that the Hodge numbers hi,0 are birational invariants\nh3 (A/\n1,1 e e\ne = h2,1 (A).\ne \u03c6)\none finds that h (A/\u03c6) = h1,1 (A) + r and h2,1 (A/\nWe apply these results to A = Ei \u00d7 Sfg and \u03c6 = (\u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S )2 and after that to A = Zfg and \u03c6 = \u03b1Z .\nSo we obtain:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3\n2\nh2,1 (Zfg ) = dim H 2,1 (Ei \u00d7 Sfg )(\u03b1E \u00d7\u03b1S ) = g + 1\n3\n\n2\n\nbecause H 2,1 (Ei \u00d7 Sfg )(\u03b1E \u00d7\u03b1S ) = H 1,0 (E) \u2297 H 1,1 (S)i \u2295 H 1,0 (E) \u2297 H 1,1 (S)\u2212i since the anti-invariant\nsublattice of H 1,1 (S) with respect to the action of \u03b12S coincides with the direct sum of the eigenspaces\nfor the eigenvalues i and \u2212i for the action of \u03b1S ;\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3\nh2,1 (Yfg ) = dim H 2,1 (Ei \u00d7 Sfg )\u03b1E \u00d7\u03b1S = g \u2212 1.\n\nTo construct Zfg (the desingularization of the first quotient of order two) we blow up 4(cg + dg )\nrational curves, so\n\u001a\n\u0010\n\u0011\n51 if g = 2\n(\u03b13E \u00d7\u03b1S )2\n1,1\n1,1\nh (Zfg ) = dim H (Ei \u00d7 Sfg )\n+ 4(cg + dg ) =\n.\n41 if g = 3\n\nTo construct Yfg from the 3-fold Zfg we blow up 4(cg + dg ) rational curves, so we have h1,1 (Yfg ) =\n\u0001\n3\ndim H 1,1 (Zfg )\u03b1Z + 4(cg + dg ).

The Hodge numbers of Zfg were computed in [V1] and [B], indeed Zfg is obtained by\napplying the Borcea\u2013Voisin construction to the K3 surface Sfg and the elliptic curve Ei . In particular\nSfg is associated to the invariant (r, a, \u03b4) = (18, 4, 1) if g = 2 and (r, a, \u03b4) = (16, 6, 1) if g = 3.\nRemark 5.4. In the computation of the Hodge numbers (in particular of h2,1 ) we used the fact that\nthe fixed loci of \u03b1S and of \u03b12S do not contain curves of positive genus.\n\u0001\nRemark 5.5. There exists a desingularization YSI of (Ei \u00d7 XSI ) / \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1X which is a Calabi\u2013Yau.\nIts Hodge numbers are h1,1 (YSI ) = 90, h2,1 (YSI ) = 0. This can be proved as in the Proposition 5.2.\nProposition 5.6. The variation of the Hodge structures of weight 3 {H 3 (Yfg , Q)}fg depends only on\nthe variation of the Hodge structures {H 1 (Cfg , Q)}fg . More precisely, there exists an isomorphism\n\u03c6 : H 1 (Cfg , Q) \u2192 H 3 (Yfg , Q) such that \u03c6(H 1,0 (Cfg , Q)\u2212i ) = H 3,0 (Yfg , Q) and \u03c6(H 0,1 (Cfg , Q)\u2212i ) =\nH 2,1 (Yfg , Q).\nProof. By the previous proposition, the Hodge structure of H 3 (Yfg , Q) is the sub-Hodge structure of\nH 3 (Ei \u00d7 Sfg , Q) which is invariant under the action of \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S . By (8) and (10) we have\nH 3,0 (Yfg , C) = h\u03b7E \u2227 \u03b7S i = h\u03b7E \u2227 \u03b7E \u2227 \u03c9C i = H 1,0 (Ei ) \u2297 H 1,0 (Ei ) \u2297 H 1,0 (Cfg )\u2212i \u2243 H 1,0 (Cfg )\u2212i ,\nsince Ei is rigid. Analogously by (8) and (11) we have\n\u0001\nH 2,1 (Yfg ) = H 1,0 (Ei ) \u2297 H 1,1 (Sfg ) i = H 1,0 (Ei ) \u2297 H 1,0 (Ei ) \u2297 H 0,1 (Cfg )i \u2243 H 0,1 (Cfg )\u2212i .\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 5.7. The complex varieties Cfg , Sfg and Yfg are parametrized by the same Shimura variety\n(cf. Proposition 1.1).\n\n\f14\n\nFAMILIES OF CALABI\u2013YAU 3\u2013FOLDS WITHOUT MAXIMAL UNIPOTENT MONODROMY\n\n5.2. The desingularization Wb2 of Ei \u00d7 Qb2 /\u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1Q . In section 3 we constructed a 1-dimensional\nfamily of K3 surfaces, Qb2 , admitting a non symplectic automorphism of order 4, \u03b1Q , such that the\nfixed loci of \u03b1Q and \u03b12Q are made up of points and rational curves (cf. Proposition 3.1). Considering\nthe quotient Ei \u00d7 Qb2 /\u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1Q one can prove the existence of a smooth Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold, Wb2 , which\ndesingularizes it, as in the Proposition 5.2. Also the computation of the Hodge numbers of Wb2 is\nsimilar to the one in proof of the Proposition 5.2, the only difference being the fixed locus of \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1S :\non the surface Qb2 there are two rational curves which are fixed by \u03b12Q , but which are switched by \u03b1Q\n(this never happens on the surface Sfg ). This does not change the computation of h2,1 , but has an\neffect on h1,1 , indeed if Q is a K3 surface with a non symplectic automorphism of order 4, \u03b1Q , and\nthere are a curves fixed by \u03b12Q but switched by \u03b1Q , c curves fixed by \u03b1Q and d curves fixed by \u03b12Q\nand invariant for \u03b1Q , then formula (13) becomes:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3\n3 \u00d7 \u03b1 )) = dim H 1,1 (E \u00d7 S)\u03b1E \u00d7\u03b1Q + 3(c + d) + 2a + 4(c + d).\n^\nh1,1 (Ei \u00d7 Q/(\u03b1\nQ\ni\nE\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3\nIn our cases a = 2, c = 2, d = 4, dim H 1,1 (Ei \u00d7 S)\u03b1E \u00d7\u03b1Q = 15, thus\nh2,1 (Wb2 ) = 1,\n\nh1,1 (Wb2 ) = 15 + 18 + 4 + 24 = 61.\n\nAs in Proposition 5.6 and Corollary 5.7, one finds that the variation of the Hodge structures of this\nfamily depends only on variation of the Hodge structures of an elliptic curve.\nThis family of Calabi\u2013Yau is well known (cf. [B], [R2, Example 1], [V1]) indeed Wb2 is the desingularization of the quotient Ei \u00d7 Ei \u00d7 E/h1 \u00d7 \u03b12E \u00d7 \u03b9E , \u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1E \u00d7 1i (cf. Remark 5.1) and hence of\nXSI \u00d7 E/(\u03b12X \u00d7 \u03b9). Thus it is obtained by the Borcea\u2013Voisin construction applied to the K3 surface\nXSI (which is the unique K3 surface admitting a non symplectic involution, \u03b12X , acting trivially on\nthe N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group and fixing 10 curves) and an elliptic curve.\n5.3. The desingularization M of the quotient Ei \u00d7 R/\u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1R . Let the family R of K3 surfaces\nbe as in the Section 4.2. Considering the quotient Ei \u00d7 R/\u03b13E \u00d7 \u03b1R one can prove the existence of a\nsmooth Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold, M , which desingularizes it, and compute the Hodge numbers of M as in\nthe Proposition 5.2. In particular\nh2,1 (M ) = 3, h1,1 (M ) = 11 + 3(1 + 3) + 4(1 + 3) = 39,\nand the variation of the Hodge structures of M depends only on the variation of the Hodge structures\n^\nof the curve B such that B \u00d7\nEi /G \u2243 R (cf. Section 4).\n6. Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of the 1-dimensional families\n6.1. The family Yfg . By the Proposition 5.6 it is clear that the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of the\nvarieties Sfg and Yfg are given by the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of Cfg . In particular if g = 2 we\nhave a one dimensional family of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds Yfg (and of K3 surfaces Sfg ). This situation is\nvery similar to the one described in [GvG, Section 2]. In this case one can explicitly compute the\nPicard\u2013Fuchs equation of Cfg (and hence of Sfg and Yfg ). Indeed (by the Section 1) one can assume\nthat Cf2 is given by the equation\nw4 = t(t \u2212 1)2 (t \u2212 \u03bb)2 .\nSo the curves Cf2 have an equation of type\nC\u03bb : z N = rA (r \u2212 1)B (r \u2212 \u03bb)C\nfor some \u03bb \u2208 C. In particular, N = 4 and one can assume that A = 1 and B = C = 2. The\nholomorphic one forms on this curve are \u03c9(0, 0, 0; 1) and \u03c9(0, 1, 1; 3) where\n\u03c9(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3; l) :=\n\nr\u03b1 (r \u2212 1)\u03b2 (r \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b3\ndr.\nzl\n\nTo find the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations, let:\na := \u2212\u03b1 + (lA/N ),\n\nb := \u2212\u03b2 + (lB/N ),\n\nc := \u2212\u03b3 + (lC/N ).\n\n\fALICE GARBAGNATI\n\n15\n\nAn explicit computation shows that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03bb) 2 + (a + c \u2212 \u03bb(a + b + 2c))\n\u2212 c(a + b + c \u2212 1) \u03c9(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3; l) = cdh\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202\u03bb\n\nwhere h is the rational function\nr\u03b1+1 (r \u2212 1)\u03b2+1 (r \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b3\u22121\nh :=\n= r1\u2212a (r \u2212 1)1\u2212b (r \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121\u2212c .\nzl\nIn particular the Picard\u2013Fuchs equation of Yf2 is not a differential equation of order 4, but of order\n2. This implies that the Picard\u2013Fuchs equation of the family Yfg has no a solution with maximal\nunipotent monodromy.\n6.2. The family Wb2 . In the Section 5.2 we constructed another 1-dimensional family of Calabi\u2013Yau\n3-folds, Wb2 , and we proved that the variation of its Hodge structures depends only on the variation\nof the Hodge structures of an elliptic curve. So the Picard-Fuchs equation of Wb2 is the one of the\nelliptic curve z 2 = r(r \u2212 1)(r \u2212 \u03bb) (which is well known, and could be computed specilizing the general\nresults presented in the Section 6.1):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n1 dr\n1\n\u22022\n\u2212\n= d(r1/2 (r \u2212 1)1/2 (r \u2212 \u03bb)\u22123/2 ).\n\u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03bb) 2 + (1 \u2212 2\u03bb)\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202\u03bb 4 z\n2\nAs before this shows directly that there is no solution with maximal unipotent monodromy.\n\n6.3. The families Yf3 and M . More in general, the Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds obtained in the Section\n5, as desingularization of Ei \u00d7 S/G for a certain K3 surface S and a certain group G, admit an\nautomorphism of order 4, induced by \u03b1E \u00d7 1S , which acts as a multiplication by i on the H 3,0 of the\nCalabi\u2013Yau. Since this automorphism commutes with the differentiation on the parameters of the\nsurface S, the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of these families of Calabi\u2013Yau can not admit solutions with\nmaximal unipotent monodromy (cf. [R2]). Moreover the fact that S is obtained as desingularization of\nEi \u00d7 B/G\u2032 for certain curve B and group G\u2032 implies that the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of the K3 surface\nand of the Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold depend only on the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of the curve B. Thus the\nPicard\u2013Fuchs equations of the family Yf3 and of the family M do not admit a solution with maximal\nunipotent monodromy and are the Picard\u2013Fuchs equations of a curve.\nReferences\nM.
