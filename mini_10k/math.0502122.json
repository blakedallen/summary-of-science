Introduction\nIt is well known that, for a closed smooth n-manifold M with n \u2265 3, a\nRiemannian metric is Einstein if and only if it is a critical point of the normalized Einstein-Hilbert functional E on the space M(M ) of all Riemannian\nmetrics on M\nR\nM Rg dVg\nE : M(M ) \u2192 R, g 7\u2192 E(g) =\n.\nVolg (M )(n\u22122)/n\nHere, Rg , dVg and Volg (M ) denote respectively the scalar curvature, the\nvolume form of the metric g, and the volume of (M, g).\nNext, we give\nthe definition of a natural differential-topological invariant Y (M ) of M ,\ncalled the Yamabe invariant or \u03c3-invariant. Denote the conformal class of a\nRiemannian metric g by\nC = [g] := {e2f * g | f \u2208 C \u221e (M )}\nDate: October, 2004.\n\u2217\nsupported in part by the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), Japan Society for\nthe Promotion of Science, No. 16540059.\n\u2020\nsupported in part by FCT-Portugal, Grant BD/893/2000.\n1\n\n\f2\n\n3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\nand the space of all conformal structures by C(M ). The Yamabe invariant\nY (M ) is defined by\nY (M ) := sup inf E(g).\nC\u2208C(M ) g\u2208C\n\nContrarily to what was stated in [7], this invariant was introduced independently by O. Kobayashi [15] and Schoen [30].\nTo put this definition in context, first recall that E is neither bounded\nfrom above nor from below for any M and so a minimization method cannot\nbe applied to E. Nevertheless, the study of the second variation of E done\nin [16, 31] (cf. [6]) leads naturally, as we will argue next, to the mini-max\ndefinition of the Yamabe invariant.\nLet M1 (M ) denote the unit volume metrics of M . Due to results of Obata\n[24] and Aubin [4], an Einstein metric h in M1 (M ) globally minimizes E in\nM1 (M )\u2229[h]. Moreover, if (M, [h]) is not conformally equivalent to (S n , [g0 ]),\nE is strictly globally minimized among variations in Th (M1 (M )\u2229[h]). Here,\ng0 is the canonical metric of constant curvature one on the standard nsphere S n . On the other hand, if we consider the infinite dimensional subspace V consisting of infinitesimal deformations orthogonal to both Th [h]\nand the subspace of infinitesimal deformations arising from the diffeomorphism group Diff(M ) of M , E is locally maximized among variations in V\nmodulo a finite dimensional subspace (possibly the zero subspace). These\nobservations roughly imply that critical points are always saddle points over\nthe moduli space M1 (M )/Diff(M ).\nThe restriction of E to any given conformal class [g] is always bounded\nfrom below. Hence, we can consider the following conformal invariant\nY (M, [g]) := inf{E(g\u0303) | g\u0303 = u4/(n\u22122) * g \u2208 [g], u > 0 in C \u221e (M )}\n)\n(\nR 4(n\u22121)\n2\n2\nM ( n\u22122 |\u2207u| + Rg u )dVg\n\u221e\nu > 0 in C (M ) ,\n= inf Qg (u) := R\n\u0001\n2n/(n\u22122) dV (n\u22122)/n\ng\nMu\n\nwhich is called the Yamabe constant of [g]. A remarkable theorem [37, 4, 5,\n29] (cf. [22, 35]) of Yamabe, Trudinger, Aubin, and Schoen asserts that each\nconformal class [g] contains metrics \u01e7, called Yamabe metrics, which realize\nthe minimum\nY (M, [g]) = E(\u01e7).\nThese metrics must have constant scalar curvature\nR\u01e7 = Y (M, [g]) * Vol\u01e7 (M )\u22122/n .\nAubin [4] (cf. [5]) also proved that\nY (M, C) \u2264 Y (S n , [g0 ]) = n(n \u2212 1)Volg0 (S n )2/n\nfor any C \u2208 C(M ). This implies that\nY (M ) =\n\nsup Y (M, C) \u2264 Y (S n ) = n(n \u2212 1)Volg0 (S n )2/n .\n\nC\u2208C(M )\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n3\n\nThere is a substantial body of work on Yamabe invariants and we will\nbriefly review some significant results (see the surveys [1, 17, 21, 36] for\nexample). The Yamabe invariant Y (M ) is positive if and only if M carries\na metric of positive scalar curvature. Some classification theorems for manifolds with positive Yamabe invariant have been obtained in [8, 9, 32, 33, 36]\nwhich show, for instance, that the n-torus T n has Y (T n ) = 0. There are also\nsome useful surgery theorems [15, 25, 26] for Yamabe invariants. LeBrun\n[20] proved that, for compact complex surfaces, the Yamabe invariant is positive, zero, or negative, if and only if the Kodaira dimension is \u2212\u221e, 0 or 1,\nor 2, respectively. LeBrun and collaborators [10, 14, 18, 19] also computed\nthe Yamabe invariants for a large class of 4-manifolds, including K\u00e4hler surfaces X with Y (X) < 0 and 0 < Y (X) < Y (S 4 ). In [21], it is constructed a\nK\u00e4hler surface which admits Einstein metrics but the Yamabe invariant is\nnot achieved by any Yamabe metric.\nRegarding 3-manifolds, the following conjecture by Schoen [31] is one of\nthe most fundamental unsolved problems related to Yamabe invariants.\nConjecture. If M is a closed 3-manifold which admits a constant curvature\nmetric h, then\nY (M ) = E(h).\nNote that, for an Einstein metric h on an n-manifold N (n \u2265 3), we have\nthat E(h) = Y (N, [h]). If E(h) > 0, this comes from Obata's Theorem [24],\nwhile the nonpositive case comes from the uniqueness (up to a normalizing\nconstant) of Yamabe metrics. Setting\nY1 := Y (S 3 ) = 6 * Volg0 (S 3 )2/3 ,\n\nYk :=\n\nY1\nk2/3\n\nfor k \u2208 N,\n\nthis conjecture implies, in particular, that if S 3 /\u0393 is a smooth quotient by a\nfinite group \u0393 of order k, then Y (S 3 /\u0393) = Yk . This conjecture is known to\nbe true for any closed manifold uniformized by T 3 and for S 3 . In [7], Bray\nand the second author showed that it is also true for S 3 /Z2 = RP3 .\nTheorem 1.1 (Bray\u2013Neves). Let M be a closed 3-manifold satisfying the\nfollowing conditions:\n(i) M is not diffeomorphic to S 3 ;\n(ii) M does not contain any non-separating embedded 2-sphere;\n(iii) M does not contain any two-sided real projective plane RP2 .\nThen,\nY (M, [g]) \u2264 Y2\n\nfor any conformal class [g]. Moreover, the equality holds if and only if (M, g)\nis conformally equivalent to RP3 with the metric h0 of constant curvature\none. In particular, Y (M ) \u2264 Y2 .\nRemark 1.2.\n\n\f4\n\n3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\n(a) The result concerning the conformal equivalence to (RP3 , [h0 ]) was\nnot investigated in [7]. However, it follows easily from the characterization of the equality condition in the Riemannian Penrose\nInequality [13, Section 8].\n(b) Condition (iii) in Theorem 1.1 is vacuous when M is orientable. A\nmore general condition was stated in [7] and it includes the case\nwhere M is RP2 \u00d7 S 1 . The necessity of such condition is addressed\nlater.\nAs a consequence, they obtained the following corollaries.\nCorollary 1.3.\nY (RP3 ) = Y2 , Y (RP2 \u00d7 S 1 ) = Y2 .\nCorollary 1.4. The only prime 3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater\n \u0303 1 (the nonorientable S 2 bundle over S 1 ).\nthan Y2 are S 3 , S 2 \u00d7 S 1 and S 2 \u00d7S\nAll these manifolds have Yamabe invariant equal to Y1 . The fact that\nY (S 2 \u00d7 S 1 ) = Y1 was proven independently by Kobayashi [15] and Schoen\n[31].\nWe now describe, in an informal way, the idea behind the proof of Theorem 1.1. Most of the definitions can be found in Section 3 but, for a more\nelaborated exposition, the reader is encouraged to see [7, Sections 3 and 4].\nAll the statements regarding the inverse mean curvature flow are proven in\n[13].\nThe general approach was to construct a nice test function, not on (M, g),\nbut instead on a conformally equivalent scalar-flat, asymptotically flat manifold (M \u2212 {p}, gAF ), where p is a point in M . Bray and Neves observed\nthat if this procedure is done for (RP3 , h0 ), then the optimal test function u0\non the corresponding scalar-flat, asymptotically flat manifold (which is the\nspacial Schwarzschild manifold), has the same level sets as the inverse mean\nb t }t\u22650 starting on the unique outermost minimal surface.\ncurvature flow {\u03a3\nThe main idea was to construct a test function u on the asymptotically flat\nmanifold M \u2212 {p} having the same level sets as the inverse mean curvature\nflow {\u03a3t }t\u22650 starting on a connected component of the outermost minimal\nb t.\nsurface. For each time t, u assumes on \u03a3t the value that u0 assumes on \u03a3\nThey showed next that if the Hawking quasi-local mass is nondecreasing,\nwhich happens precisely if \u03c7(\u03a3t ) \u2264 2 for all t, then E(u4 gAF ) \u2264 Y2 . The\ntopological assumptions on Theorem 1.1 assure that, if the initial condition\nhas Euler characteristic less or than or equal to two, then this condition is\npreserved by the inverse mean curvature (see Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.5)\nand so the result follows.\nA question left open in [7] was how to compute Y (RP3 #(S 2 \u00d7 S 1 )) or\nY ((RP2 \u00d7 S 1 )#(RP2 \u00d7 S 1 )). The problem with the above idea is that, in\nthese cases, it is impossible to guarantee the monotonicity of the Hawking\nquasi-local mass. The lack of monotonicity is a serious issue. As a matter of\nfact, we point out that the reason why this idea does not work for S 2 \u00d7 S 1\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n5\n\n(which has the Yamabe invariant Y1 ), is precisely because the Hawking quasilocal mass does not remain monotone (for some interval of time, the flow\nmight become a disconnected union of 2-spheres). In this paper, we find a\nway to overcome this difficulty.\nAcknowledgements.

The statement follows\nfrom Kobayashi's inequality combined with (1).\n\u0003\n3. Tool box review\nThe rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2.1, and so we\nstart by briefly reviewing the indispensable key results. The main references are [7], [13], and [22] for the first two subsections and [3] for the last\nsubsection.\n3.1. Yamabe constants of asymptotically flat 3-manifolds. For any\nclosed conformal 3-manifold (M, C) with positive Yamabe constant, there\nexists a scalar-flat, asymptotically flat metric gAF \u2208 C on M \u2212 {point}.\nIt turns out that this asymptotically flat manifold is more convenient for\nstudying Yamabe constants. This has played a central role in [29], [7], and\nit will also be important in our approach.\nDefinition 3.1. A Riemannian 3-manifold (N, h) is said to be asymptotically flat if there exists a compact set K \u2282 N such that N \u2212 K is diffeomorphic to R3 \u2212 {|x| \u2264 1}\nand that,\nchart defined by this diffeomorphism, the metric\nP in the coordinate\ni\nj\nh = i,j hij (x)dx dx satisfies the following:\nhij = \u03b4ij + O(|x|\u22121 ),\n\nhij,k = O(|x|\u22122 ),\n\nhij,kl = O(|x|\u22123 ).\n\nLet (M, g) be a closed 3-manifold with positive scalar curvature. Define\nthe conformal Laplacian to be\nLg := \u22128\u2206g + Rg ,\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n7\n\nand consider the normalized Green's function Gp for Lg with a pole at\np \u2208 M , that is,\nLg Gp = c0 * \u03b4p\n\non\n\nM\n\nand\n\nlim dist(p, q)Gp (q) = 1.\n\nq\u2192p\n\nHere, c0 > 0 and \u03b4p stand respectively for a specific universal positive constant and the Dirac \u03b4-function at p. The maximum principle implies that Gp\nis positive on M \u2217 := M \u2212 {p}, and hence gAF := G4p g defines a scalar-flat,\nasymptotically flat metric on M \u2217 (see [22, Section 6]).\nFor the noncompact manifold (M \u2217 , gAF ), the Yamabe constant is defined\nby\n)\n(R\n2 dV\n8|\u2207u|\n\u2217\ng\nAF\n\u221e\n\u2217\nM\nY (M \u2217 , [gAF ]) := inf\n\u00011/3 u 6\u2261 0 in Cc (M )\nR\n6 dV\nu\n\u2217\ngAF\n(R M\n)\n2\n1,2\n\u2217\nM \u2217 8|\u2207u| dVgAF\n= inf\n\u00011/3 u 6\u2261 0 in W (M , gAF ) .\nR\n6 dV\nu\n\u2217\ng\nAF\nM\n\nFrom the Sobolev embedding theorem for asymptotically flat manifolds, we\nnote that\nW 1,2 (M \u2217 , gAF ) \u0592\u2192 L6 (M \u2217 , gAF ).\nIt is readily seen that Y (M \u2217 , [gAF ]) = Y (M, [g]).\n\n3.2. Inverse mean curvature flow. Like in [7], the inverse mean curvature flow developed by Huisken and Ilmanen in [13] will be a crucial tool\nto prove Theorem 2.1. The main difference this time is its application to\na family of asymptotically flat manifolds with boundary. We now introduce\nsome of their terminology and present the main results of [13] that will be\nnecessary for our purposes.\nIn this subsection, (N, h) will always denote an asymptotically flat 3manifold with boundary \u2202N consisting of a union of minimal surfaces. For\na C 1 surface \u03a3 contained in N , H \u2208 L1l (\u03a3) is called the weak mean curvature\nof \u03a3 provided\nZ\nZ\nHhX, \u03bdi dAh\n\ndivN (X) dAh =\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nfor all vector fields X with compact support on N , where \u03bd is the exterior\nunit normal vector. If \u03a3 is smooth, \u2212H\u03bd coincides with the usual mean\ncurvature of \u03a3.\nFor any surface \u03a3 of (N, h), \u03a3 = \u03a3 h stands for the 2-dimensional\nHausdorff measure of \u03a3. A precompact set E of N is called a minimizing\nhull in N if it minimizes area on the outside, that is,\n\u2202\u2217E \u2264 \u2202\u2217F\n\nfor any F containing E such that F \u2212 E \u2282\u2282 N , where \u2202 \u2217 F is the reduced\nboundary of F .\nHuisken and Ilmanen [13, Sections 3 and 6] proved the following existence\nresult for inverse mean curvature flow.\n\n\f8\n\n3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\nTheorem 3.2 (Existence). Let E0 be an open precompact minimizing hull\nin N with smooth boundary \u2202E0 . Then, there exists a precompact locally\nLipschitz \u03c6 on N satisfying:\n(i) For t \u2265 0, \u03a3t := \u2202{\u03c6 < t} defines an increasing family of C 1,\u03b1\nsurfaces (0 < \u03b1 < 1) such that \u03a30 = \u2202E0 ;\n(ii) For almost all t \u2265 0, the weak mean curvature of \u03a3t is |\u2207\u03c6 |\u03a3t ;\n(iii) For almost all t \u2265 0,\n|\u2207\u03c6 |\u03a3t 6= 0\n\nfor almost all x \u2208 \u03a3t\n\n(with respect to the surface measure) and\n\u03a30 et \u2264 \u03a3t \u2264 ( \u03a30 + \u2202N ) et\n\nfor all t \u2265 0.\n\nWhen \u03c6 is smooth with nonvanishing gradient, (ii) implies that the surfaces {\u03c6 = t}t\u22650 are a solution to inverse mean curvature flow with initial\ncondition \u2202E0 because the velocity vector for such deformation is given by\n|\u2207\u03c6 |\u22121 \u03bd,\nwhere \u03bd is the exterior unit normal to {\u03c6 = t}.\nDefinition 3.3. For a compact C 1 surface \u03a3 with weak mean curvature H\nin L2 (\u03a3), the Hawking quasi-local mass is defined to be\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u03a3\n2\nH dAh .\n16\u03c0 \u2212\nmH (\u03a3) :=\n(16\u03c0)3\n\u03a3\nFor the rest of this subsection, assume that E0 is an open connected\nprecompact minimizing hull in N with smooth boundary \u2202E0 , and that\n{\u03a3t }t\u22650 is a weak solution for the inverse mean curvature flow with initial\ncondition \u03a30 = \u2202E0 .\nUnder the condition that (N, h) has nonnegative scalar curvature, we\nhave the following remarkable property for the weak inverse mean curvature\nflow [13].\nTheorem 3.4 (Geroch Monotonicity). Let (N, h) be an asymptotically flat\n3-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature. The Hawking quasi-local mass\nmH (\u03a3t ) is a nondecreasing function of t provided \u03c7(\u03a3t ) \u2264 2 for all t.\nThe monotonicity of the Hawking quasi-local mass will be of major importance in proving Theorem 2.1. The next Lemma gives topological conditions\non N that guarantee this monotonicity.\nLemma 3.5. Assume that besides the assumption in Theorem 3.4, N does\nnot contain any non-separating embedded 2-sphere and any two-sided real\nprojective plane. Then,\n\u03c7(\u03a3t ) \u2264 2\nfor all t \u2265 0, provided that \u2202E0 is connected.\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n9\n\nProof. Let \u03c6 be the function defining the weak solution {\u03a3t }t\u22650 . According\nto [13, Sections 4 and 6], the connectedness of E0 implies that both {\u03c6 < t}\nand {\u03c6 > t} remain connected for all t.\nIt is also proven in [13] that, for each t > 0, \u03a3t can be approximated\nby earlier surfaces \u03a3s for which \u2207\u03c6 never vanishes. Hence, without loss of\ngenerality, we can assume that\n\u03a3t = {\u03c6 = t} = \u2202{\u03c6 > t} = \u2202{\u03c6 < t}.\nThe connectedness of the two sets on the right of the above expression\nimplies that \u03a3t is two-sided. We now show that \u03c7(\u03a3t ) > 2 is impossible.\nIf \u03a3t contains a 2-sphere, then this 2-sphere has to bound a connected\nregion, and hence \u03c7(\u03a3t ) = 2 because {\u03c6 < t} is connected. If \u03a3t contains a\nreal projective plane, then it has to be one-sided. This contradicts that \u03a3t\nis two-sided.\n\u0003\n3.3. Aubin's lemma. The next Lemma, due to Aubin [3], is a key tool to\nprove Theorem 2.1.\nLemma 3.6 (Aubin). Let (M, g) be a closed n-manifold with positive Yamabe constant and (Mk , gk ) a non-trivial finite k-fold Riemannian covering\n(i.e., k \u2265 2). Then,\nY (M, [g]) < Y (Mk , [gk ]).\nRemark 3.7. Aubin's proof assumes that Mk is a normal covering of M\n(cf. [3, Theorem 6]). We have to adapt its proof in order to remove this\ncondition.\nProof. Let u be a normalized positive function that minimizes the Yamabe\nquotient Qgk , that is,\nZ\nu2n/(n\u22122) dVgk = 1.\nQgk (u) = E(u4/(n\u22122) gk ) = Y (Mk , [gk ]) and\nMk\n\nFor any x \u2208 Mk , set\n\n\u0001\n{x1 , * * * , xk } := P \u22121 P(x)\n\nwith\n\nx1 = x,\n\nwhere P denotes the k-fold covering map. Define positive functions v and\nv <p> (for each p > 0) on Mk by\nv(x) :=\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\nu(xi )\n\nand v <p> (x) :=\n\nk\nX\n\nu(xi )p .\n\ni=1\n\nFor any evenly covered open set U (\u2282 M ) for P, set\n\n{U1 , * * * , Uk } := P \u22121 (U ) (\u2282 Mk ).\n\nMoreover, all the sets are isometric and so we can find, for instance, k\nisometries\n\u03b3i : U1 \u2212\u2192 Ui i = 1, * * * , k\n\n\f3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\n10\n\nsatisfying P \u25e6 \u03b3i = P. As a result, it is possible to express v and v <p> on\nU1 as\nk\nk\nX\nX\n<p>\n(u \u25e6 \u03b3i )p ,\nu \u25e6 \u03b3i , v\n:=\nv=\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nv, v <p>\n\nC \u221e (Mk ).\n\nand hence\n\u2208\nWe can use the local expression described above in order find k distinct\nisometries\n\u03b3i : Mk \u2212 S \u2212\u2192 Mk \u2212 S, i = 1, * * * , k,\n\nwhere S is a piecewise smooth compact (n \u2212 1)-submanifold such that\nP \u22121 (P(S)) = S. Hence, if we set ui := u \u25e6 \u03b3i , we have that on Mk \u2212 S\nv=\n\nk\nX\n\nand v <p> =\n\nui\n\nk\nX\n\nupi ,\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nfrom which it follows that\nZ\nZ\n<p>\nv\ndVgk = k\n\nMk\n\nMk\n\nup dVgk\n\nand\nLk v = Y (Mk , [gk ])v <(n+2)/(n\u22122)> = Y (Mk , [gk ])\n\nk\nX\n\n(n+2)/(n\u22122)\n\nui\n\n,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Lk := \u2212 4(n\u22121)\nn\u22122 \u2206gk + Rgk is the conformal Laplacian with respect to\ngk .\nDefine v0 to be the function on M whose lift to Mk is v.

Overall strategy\nIn this section we describe our approach to Theorem 2.1-(1) in the simple\ncase that L = S 2 \u00d7 S 1 . Let\nN := M #(S 2 \u00d7 S 1 ),\n\nwhere M is a closed 3-manifold satisfying conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) in\nTheorem 2.1. Without loss of generality, we may assume that Y (N, [g]) >\n0 and that g is a Yamabe metric with Volg (N ) = 1. Note that Rg \u2261\nY (N, [g]) > 0.\nConsider Riemannian coverings of (N, g) defined in the following way.\nTake a smooth loop c in S 2 \u00d7S 1 whose homotopy class hci generates \u03c01 (S 2 \u00d7\nS 1 ). We regard the loop c as a loop in N . Let (Nk , gk ) and (N\u221e , g\u221e )\ndenote, respectively, the k-fold Riemannian covering and the normal infinite\nRiemannian covering associated to hci. Note that, topologically,\nNk = #kM #(S 2 \u00d7 S 1 ),\n\n2\nN\u221e = #\u221e\n1 M #(S \u00d7 R),\n\n\f12\n\n3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\nand that the covering N\u221e \u2192 Nk is also normal. From Aubin's Lemma 3.6\nwe have that, for all k \u2265 2,\nY (N, [g]) < Y (Nk , [gk ]),\nand this implies that\nY (N, [g]) < lim sup Y (Nk , [gk ]).\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nThe strict inequality comes from the fact that we can choose an increasing\nsubsequence of {Y (Nk , [gk ])}k\u22651 , for instance, {Y (N2m , [g2m ])}m\u22651 . Moreover, modifying the techniques in [15, Section 6] and [2, Sections 5 and 6],\nwe can prove the following\nlim Y (Nk , [gk ]) = Y (N\u221e , [g\u221e ]).\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nHowever, the above strict inequality is sufficient for our proof that Y (N, [g]) <\nY2 .\nUnlike each Nk , the noncompact manifold N\u221e satisfies the conditions (i),\n(ii), and (iii) of Theorem 1.1, and hence, at least heuristically, this suggests\nthat\nlim sup Y (Nk , [gk ]) = Y (N\u221e , [g\u221e ]) \u2264 Y2 .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nIt should be also pointed out that the scalar-flat, asymptotically flat manifold conformally equivalent to (N\u221e \u2212{point}, g\u221e ), will have two singularities\ncreated by the two ends of N\u221e . Therefore, we can not apply the inverse\nmean curvature flow technique directly to this manifold. Instead, we apply it\nto a family of asymptotically flat manifolds without singularities (but with\nboundary), arising from the manifolds (Nk\u2217 , gk,AF ) that we describe next.\nFix a point p\u221e \u2208 N\u221e and call its projection to each Nk also by p\u221e . Let\nGk be the normalized Green's function on Nk for the conformal Laplacian\nLgk with the pole at p\u221e . Consider the following scalar-flat, asymptotically\nflat metrics\ngk,AF := G4k gk\n\non\n\nNk\u2217 := Nk \u2212 {p\u221e }.\n\nUsing inverse mean curvature flow techniques, we will show\nTheorem 4.1.\nlim sup Y (Nk\u2217 , [gk ]) \u2264 Y2 .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nThe proof of Theorem 4.1 is given in the next two sections. Some extra\ndifficulties arise for the general case because the infinite Riemannian covering\nwill have infinitely many ends. Fortunately, the method developed here and\nin Sections 5, 6 is robust enough to handle those cases. The proof will be\ngiven in Section 7.\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n13\n\n5. Proof of main theorem: simple case\nUnder the same assumptions of Section 4, consider the normalized minimal positive Green's function G\u221e on (N\u221e , g\u221e ) for the conformal Laplacian\nLg\u221e with the pole at p\u221e (cf. [34, Section 1], [2, Section 6]). This function\n\u2217 := N \u2212 {p } and it is essential to control the geometry\nis defined on N\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u2217\nof (Nk , gk,AF ). All the statements in this section regarding these manifolds\nwill follow from the good understanding we have for G\u221e .\nWe start by collecting the properties G\u221e and Gk in Lemma 5.1. After\nthis, we describe the main idea behind the proof of Theorem 4.1 and state\nfour auxiliary lemmas, whose proofs will be given in the next section. We\nthen prove Theorem 4.1.\nFor reasons of simplicity, we set the following notation for the rest of the\npaper. Any quantity Q that depends on gk,AF or gk will be denoted by\nQk,AF or Qk respectively. If it is obvious from the context which metric is\nbeing considered, we will just denote it by Q.\nLet \u03b3 be the deck transformation of N\u221e corresponding to the homotopy\nclass of hci \u2208 \u03c01 (N ), that is,\nNk = N\u221e /{h\u03b3 jk i | j \u2208 Z} for\n\nk \u2265 1.\n\nFor simplicity, we often identify a set in N\u221e with its projection to each Nk\nand a function on Nk with its lift to N\u221e . For instance, Gk denotes both the\nnormalized Green's function on Nk and its lift to N\u221e .\nStandard arguments developed in [34], [11], and [2], imply the following\nlemma regarding the functions Gk and G\u221e .

Note that Fk is connected and that\nlim distgk (p\u221e , Fk ) = \u221e.\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nThe topological condition on M implies that all non-separating 2-spheres\nof Nk\u2217 are cobordant to each other. Such 2-spheres correspond to a \" neck\"\non Nk\u2217 . The properties (ii) and (iii) say that (Nk\u2217 , gk,AF ) has, for k large\nenough, a very small \"neck\". This is the content of the following Lemma.\nLemma 5.2. For every k, there exists an area-minimizing, non-separating,\nconnected embedded 2-sphere Sk of (Nk\u2217 , gk,AF ) such that\nlim Sk\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere Sk\n\nk,AF\n\nk,AF\n\n= 0,\n\ndenotes the area of Sk with respect to gk,AF .\n\nSet Xk to be the metric completion of\nNk\u2217 \u2212 Sk = Nk \u2212 ({p\u221e } \u222a Sk ),\n\nand denote the smooth metric extension of gk,AF to Xk by the same symbol. Then, (Xk , gk,AF ) becomes an asymptotically flat manifold with minimal boundary consisting of two 2-spheres. This corresponds to \"cutting\nout the small neck\" of Nk\u2217 . The advantage of working with Xk rather than\nNk\u2217 is that, as can be easily seen, any embedded 2-sphere of Xk bounds a\nconnected region. Therefore, by Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, the monotonicity of the Hawking quasi-local mass is preserved for each solution of\ninverse mean curvature flow on (Xk , gk,AF ), provided that its initial condition is the connected boundary of a connected region. Taking into account\nthat the area |\u2202Xk |k,AF of \u2202Xk goes to zero as k goes to infinity, we expect\nto construct a nice family of test functions uk with\nlim sup Qgk,AF (uk ) \u2264 Y2 .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nUsing the inverse mean curvature flow techniques in the same spirit as in\n[7], we have the following result.\nLemma 5.3. Let (X, h) be an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with minimal\nboundary \u2202X. Assume further there exists a weak solution for the inverse\nmean curvature flow, with initial condition a minimal surface \u03a30 , that keeps\nthe Hawking quasi-local mass nondecreasing. Then, there exists a function\nv in W 1,2 (X, h) such that 0 \u2264 v \u2264 1 on X and\nR\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n\u22121\nX 8|\u2207v| dVh\n\u2264\nY\n+\n\u03b8\n\u2202X\n\u03a3\n,\n2\n0\n\u0001\nR\n6 dV 1/3\nv\nh\nX\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n15\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a continuous function independent of (X, h) and vanishing at\nzero.\nAn outermost minimal surface of an asymptotically flat 3-manifold (X, h)\nis a minimal surface (possibly disconnected) which encloses all other compact\nminimal surfaces. Since each Nk\u2217 is not diffeomorphic to R3 , a result due to\nMeeks, Simon and Yau [23] implies that (Xk , gk,AF ) has a unique outermost\nminimal surface \u03a9 which is the disjoint union of a finite number of weakly\nembedded 2-spheres (i.e., limits of uniformly smooth embedded 2-spheres).\nMoreover, the region exterior to the outermost minimal surface is R3 minus\na finite number of closed balls (see [13, Section 4] for details). The next\nLemma guarantees that one of the connected components of the outermost\nminimal surface has area bounded below independently of k.\nLemma 5.4. The outermost minimal surface of each (Xk , gk,AF ) has a connected component \u03a3(k) with area bounded below independently of k.\nRemark 5.5. The surface \u03a3(k) is a minimizing hull because it is contained in\nthe outermost minimal surface. If \u03a3(k) is a 2-sphere, then it is the boundary\nof a precompact connected open set, and hence it can be used as an initial\ncondition for the inverse mean curvature flow (see Theorem 3.2). If \u03a3(k) is a\none-sided RP2 , then it is the limit of uniformly smooth embedded 2-spheres\nthat are minimizing hulls bounding a precompact open connected set. We\nthen take the limit of the weak solutions to inverse mean curvature flow\nstarting at each of these 2-spheres, in order to get a weak solution to the\ninverse mean curvature flow with initial condition \u03a3(k). This can be done\nrigorously using the compactness theorem and the a priori bounds proved\nin [13, Sections 2 and 3].\nIt can be easily seen that Theorem 4.1 is false when M is either S 3 or\n\u00d7 S 1 , in which case N is S 2 \u00d7 S 1 or (S 2 \u00d7 S 1 )#(S 2 \u00d7 S 1 ), respectively.\nThe technical reason why this proof doesn't work for those cases is because\nLemma 5.4 doesn't hold. It is worthwhile to point out that, among the\nauxiliary lemmas we state in this section, Lemma 5.4 is the only lemma\nwhere the topological restrictions on M play a role.\nThe function v given by Lemma 5.3 may not vanish on the boundary.\nTherefore, if we want to apply this result to our sequence of asymptotically\nflat manifolds (Xk , gk,AF ), we need to multiply the resulting functions by\nsome cut-off function vanishing on the boundary \u2202Xk . Otherwise, we could\nnot extend it to be a valid test function on Nk\u2217 . This is a delicate issue because, in general, the multiplication by a cut-off function makes the Yamabe\nquotient increase. Fortunately, using Lemma 5.1 (iv) and (v), we can prove\nthe following result.\n\nS2\n\nLemma 5.6.

Thus, \u03a9k,0 will have, for k large enough, very\nsmall area and diameter bounded from below. Moreover, it will be apparent\nfrom the construction of Ak and Bk that the complement of both sets in Xk\nhas bounded sectional curvature independently of k.

This completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\n7. Proof of main theorem: general case\nIn this section, we complete the proof of Theorem 2.1. Let L be a closed\n3-manifold for which each prime factor contains either a non-separating S 2\nor a two-sided RP2 . Then, according to [12, Theorem 12.7 and its Proof], L\ncan be expressed as\n \u0303 1 )#Q1 # * * * #Ql3 ,\nL := #l1 (S 2 \u00d7 S 1 )#l2 (S 2 \u00d7S\nwhere l1 + l2 + l3 \u2265 1 and each Qi is a prime closed 3-manifold with a\ntwo-sided RP2 which is homotopy equivalent to RP2 \u00d7 S 1 . Furthermore, set\nN := M #L,\n\nwhere M is a closed 3-manifold satisfying the conditions (ii) and (iii) in\nTheorem 2.1. For the proof of the assertion (1) in Theorem 2.1, we assume\nthat M is not diffeomorphic to S 3 and l1 + l2 \u2265 1. For the proof of the\nassertion (2) in Theorem 2.1, we assume that l3 \u2265 1. In order to prove\nTheorem 2.1 it suffices to show that\nY (N, [g]) < Y2\nfor any unit-volume Yamabe metric g on N with Y (N, [g]) > 0.\nWe now describe a suitable infinite Riemannian covering of (N, g). If L\nhas no two-sided RP2 (i.e., l3 = 0), define L\u221e to be the (infinite) universal\n\n\f22\n\n3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\ncovering of L. In this case, l1 + l2 \u2265 1 and M satisfies the conditions (i),\n(ii) and (iii) in Theorem 2.1. If L has a two-sided RP2 (i.e., l3 \u2265 1), then\nthere exists a normal infinite covering L\u221e \u2192 L having a two-sided RP2 in its\nfundamental domain and such that every embedded 2-sphere and every twosided RP2 in L\u221e separate L\u221e . Finally, let (N\u221e , g\u221e ) be the normal infinite\nRiemannian covering of (N, g) associated to the normal infinite covering L\u221e\nof L which is topologically\nN\u221e = # \u221e\n1 M #L\u221e .\nBefore stating the relevant properties of N\u221e , we need to introduce some\nnotation.\nFix p\u221e \u2208 N\u221e and consider a sequence of finite Riemannian coverings\n{(Nk , gk )}k\u22651 of (N, g) satisfying (N1 , g1 ) = (N, g) and the following:\n(i) N\u221e is an infinite covering of each Nk .\n(ii) Nk+1 is a finite covering of Nk for k \u2265 1.\n(iii) For k \u2265 2, there exists a fundamental domain of Nk containing p\u221e\nck (\u2282 N\u221e ) satisfies\nsuch that its closure N\nck .\n{x \u2208 N\u221e | distg\u221e (x, p\u221e ) \u2264 k} ( N\n\nck is smooth and that\nWe can assume, without loss of generality, that \u2202 N\nc\n[\n\u2202 Nk+1 , \u2202 Nk have the same projection on Nk for all k \u2265 2. Denote by\nb (\u2282 N\u221e ) the closure of a fundamental domain of N containing p\u221e such\nN\nc2 and \u2202 N\nb have the same projection on N .\nthat \u2202 N\nThe important properties of N\u221e are that every embedded 2-sphere and\nb \u2212 {p\u221e } is not diffeoevery two-sided RP2 in N\u221e separate N\u221e , and that N\n3\nmorphic to R minus a finite number of balls. This last assertion follows\nfrom the fact that either M satisfies the conditions (i)-(iii) in Theorem 2.1\nor the covering N\u221e \u2192 N has a fundamental domain with a two-sided RP2 .\nLet\nG := \u03c01 (N )/\u03c01 (N\u221e ) and\n\nGk := \u03c01 (Nk )/\u03c01 (N\u221e ) \u2282 G\n\ndenote the groups of deck transformations for the normal covering N\u221e \u2192 N\nand for each of the normal coverings N\u221e \u2192 Nk , respectively. Here, we\nidentify \u03c01 (N\u221e ) with its projections to \u03c01 (N ) and \u03c01 (Nk ). Set\nWn := {\u03b3 \u2208 G | distg\u221e (\u03b3(p\u221e ), p\u221e ) \u2265 n}.\nEach Gk has the property that\nGk \u2212 {e} \u2282 Wq(k) ,\nwhere {q(k)} is a sequence of positive integers going to infinity with q(k) \u2264\nq(k + 1) for all k \u2265 1.\nWe denote the projection of p\u221e to each Nk also by p\u221e . Like in Section 4,\nlet Gk be the normalized Green's function on Nk for the conformal Laplacian\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n23\n\nLgk with the pole at p\u221e . Consider the following scalar-flat, asymptotically\nflat metrics\ngk,AF := G4k gk on Nk\u2217 := Nk \u2212 {p\u221e }.\nUsing Aubin's Lemma 3.6,\nY (N, [g]) < Y (Nk , [gk ]) < Y (Nk+1 , [gk+1 ])\nfor all k \u2265 2. Therefore, it suffices to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 7.1.\nlim Y (Nk\u2217 , [gk,AF ]) \u2264 Y2 .\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nProof. The strategy for the proof is the same as in Sections 4 and 5.\nConsider the normalized minimal positive Green's function G\u221e on N\u221e\n\u2217 := N\nfor Lg\u221e with the pole at p\u221e . This function is defined on N\u221e\n\u221e \u2212\n{p\u221e }. Note that Lemma 5.1 still holds, with some modifications, in this\nnew setting. For example, Lemma 5.1 (i) becomes\nX\nG\u221e \u25e6 \u03b3 on N\u221e\n(6)\nGk =\n\u03b3\u2208Gk\n\nfor all k \u2265 1, and Lemma 5.1 (iii) now says that\n(7)\n\nlim sup{G\u221e (\u03b3(x)) | x \u2208 K, \u03b3 \u2208 Wn } = 0\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2217 .\nfor every compact set K of N\u221e\nThe main difference between the case we consider in this section and the\none considered in Section 5 is that the number of \"necks\" in Nk\u2217 increases\nwith k. Nevertheless, we show that these \"necks\" are very small when k is\nlarge enough.\n\nLemma 7.2. For any k, there exists a family \u0393k of disjoint embedded surfaces in Nk\u2217 such that each of its connected components is either a 2-sphere\nor a two-sided RP2 which minimizes area (with respect to gk,AF ), and that\nlim \u0393k\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk,AF\n\n= 0.\n\nMoreover, every embedded 2-sphere and every embedded two-sided RP2 of\nNk\u2217 \u2212 \u0393k bound a connected region.\n\nb which projects\nProof. Take a subset S of the connected components of \u2202 N\n\u2217\ninjectively into N , such that every embedded 2-sphere and every embedded\ntwo-sided RP2 of N \u2212 S separate. Note that N \u2212 S is connected and that\n0\nS is the disjoint union of connected components {Sj }jj=1\n, which are either\nembedded 2-spheres or two-sided real projective planes. From the construction of Nk , (replacing {q(k)} by another sequence with the same properties\nif necessary) there exist subsets\nsuch that\n\nIj,k \u2282 Wq(k) \u2282 G\n\nfor j = 1, * * * , j0 ,\n\nck ,\n(I1,k (S1 ) \u2294 * * * \u2294 Ij0 ,k (Sj0 )) \u2282 \u2202 N\n\n\f3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\n24\n\nand every embedded 2-sphere and every two-sided RP2 of\nNk \u2212 (I1,k (S1 ) \u2294 * * * \u2294 Ij0 ,k (Sj0 ))\nseparate, where\nIj,k (Sj ) := {\u03b3(Sj ) | \u03b3 \u2208 Ij,k } for j = 1, * * * , j0 .\n\nNote also that Nk \u2212 (I1,k (S1 ) \u2294 * * * \u2294 Ij0 ,k (Sj0 )) is connected. We now check\nthat\nlim I1,k (S1 ) \u2294 * * * \u2294 Ij0 ,k (Sj0 ) k,AF = 0.\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nFrom (6), we have for j = 1, * * * , j0 ,\nZ\nXZ\nG\u221e \u25e6 \u03b3 dA\u221e =\n\u03b3\u2208G\n\nHence,\nlim\n\nZ\n\nSj\n\nk\u2192\u221e I (Sj )\nj,k\n\nGk dAk = lim\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2264 lim\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nSj\n\nG1 dA1 < \u221e.\n\nXZ\n\n\u03b3\u2208Gk\n\nIj,k (Sj )\n\nX Z\n\n\u03b3\u2208Wq(k)\n\n= 0,\n\nSj\n\nG\u221e \u25e6 \u03b3 dA\u221e\n\nG\u221e \u25e6 \u03b3 dA\u221e\n\nprovided that q(k) goes to infinity. Using (7), we have that\nlim sup{G\u221e (x) | x \u2208 Ii,k (Si )} = 0 for j = 1, * * * , j0 ,\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nand thus this implies\nlim Ij,k (Sj )\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk,AF\n\n= lim\n\nZ\n\nk\u2192\u221e Ij,k (Sj )\n\n\u2264 lim\n\nZ\n\nk\u2192\u221e Ij,k (Sj )\n\n= 0.\n\nG4k dAk\nGk dAk\n\nThe proof follows by minimizing area (with respect to gk,AF ) in the isotopy\nclass of I1,k (S1 ) \u2294 * * * \u2294 Ij0 ,k (Sj0 ). The existence and regularity theory in [23]\nsays that the area minimizer is, in this case, a disjoint union of 2-spheres\nand real projective planes. Again, according to [23, Section 3], the connected\ncomponents of the area minimizer can be jointed by arbitrarily thin tubes\nso that the resulting surface is isotopic to I1,k (S1 ) \u2294 * * * \u2294 Ij0 ,k (Sj0 ). Hence,\nthe area minimizer has to contain a minimal surface \u0393k (\u2282 Nk\u2217 ) consisting\nof 2-spheres or two-sided real projective planes such that every embedded\n\u0003\n2-sphere and every two-sided RP2 in Nk\u2217 \u2212 \u0393k separate.\nSet Xk to be the metric completion of\nNk\u2217 \u2212 \u0393k = Nk \u2212 ({p\u221e } \u222a \u0393k ),\n\n\fKazuo Akutagawa and Andr\u00e9 Neves\n\n25\n\nand denote the smooth metric extension of gk,AF to Xk by the same symbol.\nThen, (Xk , gk,AF ) becomes an asymptotically flat manifold with minimal\nboundary consisting of a disjoint union of 2-spheres and projective planes.\nNote that Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.5 imply the monotonicity of the Hawking quasi-local mass for each solution of the inverse mean curvature flow on\n(Xk , gk,AF ), provided that its initial surface is the boundary of a connected\nregion.\nb \u2212 {p\u221e } is not diffeomorphic to R3 minus a finite number of\nSince N\nballs, there exists a positive constant \u03b1 such that G\u22121\n\u221e [\u03b1, +\u221e) has also this\nproperty. The proof of Lemma 5.4 can then be easily modified to give the\nfollowing.\nLemma 7.3. The outermost minimal surface of each (Xk , gk,AF ) has a connected component \u03a3(k) with area bounded from below independently of k.\nThe argument in the proof of Lemma 5.6 is still applicable to this new\nsetting. The same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 4.1 in Section 4\ncompletes the proof of Theorem 7.1.\n\u0003\n\n\f26\n\n3-manifolds with Yamabe invariant greater than that of RP3\n\nReferences\nc\n\n[1] K.
