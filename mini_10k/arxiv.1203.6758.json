The linearized equations are obtained after\nsubstituting the expressions for the components of\nthe velocity and pressure field into the Navier\nStokes equations and only considering contributions\nof first order in delta.

The\nmathematical description of the dynamics of\nswirling flows is hindered by the requirement to\nconsider three-dimensional and nonlinear effects,\nsingularity and various instabilities as in [7, 8, 9].\nThe objective of this paper is to present new\ninstruments that can provide relevant conclusions on\nthe stability of swirling flows, assessing both\nanalytically methodology and numerical methods.\nThe study involves new mathematical models and\nsimulation algorithms that translate equations into\ncomputer code instructions immediately following\nproblem formulations. Classical vortex problems\nwere chosen to validate the code with the existing\nresults in the literature. The paper is outlined as\nfollows: Section 1 gives a brief motivation for the\nstudy of hydrodynamic stability using computer\naided techniques. The dispersion equation governing\nthe linear stability analysis for swirling flows against\nnormal mode perturbations is derived in Section 2.\nIn Section 3 a nodal collocation method is proposed\nfor viscous stability investigations and in Section 4 a\nmodal collocation method is developed, based on\nshifted orthogonal expansions, assessing different\nboundary conditions. In Section 5 the hydrodynamic\nmodels are applied upon the velocity profile of a Qvortex and Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\nW\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03b8 + U \u2202 z \u2212\n\u2206\u2212 2\nr\nRe\nr Re\n2W\n2\nL12 = \u2212\n+ 2\n\u2202\u03b8 , L13 = 0 , L14 = \u2202 r ,\nr\nr Re\nW\n2\nL21 = W '+ \u2212 2\n\u2202\u03b8 ,\nr r Re\nW\n1\n1\n, L23 = 0 ,\nL22 = \u2202 t + \u2202\u03b8 + U \u2202 z \u2212\n\u2206+ 2\nr\nRe\nr Re\n1\nL24 = \u2202\u03b8 , L31 = U ' ,\nr\nW\n1\nL32 = 0 , L33 = \u2202 t + \u2202\u03b8 + U \u2202 z \u2212\n\u2206,\nr\nRe\n1\nL34 = \u2202 z , L41 = \u2202 r + ,\nr\n1\nL42 = \u2202\u03b8 , L43 = \u2202 z , L44 = 0 ,\nr\nwhere \u2202{t , z , r ,\u03b8 } denote the partial derivative operators\nL11 = \u2202 t +\n\nand primes denote derivative with respect to radial\ncoordinate.

If the flow returns to its\noriginal laminar state one defines the flow as stable,\nwhereas if the disturbance grows and causes the\nlaminar flow to change into a different state, one\ndefines the flow as unstable. Instabilities often result\nin turbulent fluid motion, but they may also take the\nflow into a different laminar, usually more\ncomplicated state. The equations governing the\ngeneral evolution of fluid flow are known as the\nNavier-Stokes equations [4]. They describe the\nconservation of mass and momentum. The evolution\nequations for the disturbance can be derived by\nconsidering a basic state {U = ( u z , ur , u\u03b8 ) , p} and a\nperturbed\n\nstate\n\n{V = ( v , v , v ) , \u03c0 } ,\nz\n\nr\n\n\u03b8\n\nwith\n\nwhere E ( t , z, \u03b8 ) \u2261 ei ( kz + m\u03b8 \u2212\u03c9t ) , F , G , H , P represent the\ncomplex amplitudes of the perturbations, k is the\ncomplex axial wave number, m is the tangential\ninteger wave number and \u03c9 represents the complex\nfrequency.
