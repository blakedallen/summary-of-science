Action needs to be taken now to reduce\nglobal emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere to avoid the risk of irreversible damage to the\noceans. We recommend that all possible approaches be considered to prevent CO2\nreaching the atmosphere. No option that can make a significant contribution should be\ndismissed.\u0094\"\nQuantitatively, it is further maintained that \u0093\"If global emissions of CO2 from human\nactivities continue to rise on current trends then the average pH of the oceans could fall\nby 0.5 units (equivalent to a three fold increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions) by\nthe year 2100. This pH is probably lower than has been experienced for hundreds of\nmillennia and, critically, this rate of change is probably one hundred times greater than at\nany time over this period.\u0094\"\nZeebe, et al. [2] argue that, in contrast to climate model predictions, \u0093\"future ocean\nchemistry projections are largely model-independent on a time scale of a few centuries,\nmainly because the chemistry of CO2 in seawater is well known and changes in surface\nocean carbonate chemistry closely track changes in atmospheric CO2.\u0094\"\nThese are very strong claims and if true mandate immediate action to protect one of the\nworld\u0092's most precious assets, one that is currently experiencing the tragedy of the\ncommons due to over fishing and habitat destruction. There are, however, significant\nuncertainties in projections of ocean pH even though \u0093\"the chemistry of CO2 in seawater is\nwell known\u0094\".\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: The relationship between pH and pCO2 is\ndiscussed in terms of two expressions easily derived from the chemistry of seawater (the\nderivations are given in the Appendix); this is followed by a description of the limited pH\ndata available from Ocean Station Aloha; a comparison of the actual data with the\n2\n\n\ftheoretical models follows. It is then shown that the extrapolation of pH in the Royal\nSociety Report is consistent with a doubtful linear extrapolation of the Ocean Station\nAloha or similar data. There follows a discussion of ocean mixing times and the Royal\nSociety assumption that there will be no mixing of surface water with the deep ocean.\nAn introduction to seawater response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide\nconcentrations is also given in the Appendix.\nThe relationship between pH and pCO2\nIn footnote 32, Pearson and Palmer [3] give the following equation for estimating pCO2\nas a function of hydrogen ion concentration and total dissolved carbon:\n<1\n\npCO 2 = K H H 2CO 3 = K H 1 +\n\nK 1K 2\nK1\n+ +\n+ 2\nH\nH\n\nYCO 2.\n\n(1)\nOrder of magnitude estimates of the dissociation constants imply that only the second\nterm in the denominator of the r.h.s. is of importance. This results in the relation\n\npCO 2 =\n\nK H YCO 2\npH .\nK 110\n\n(2)\nCaldeira and Berner [4] give the expression\n\npCO 2 =\n\nKH\n<\n2<\n+\n+ 2\nKH\nH HCO 3 =\nH CO 3 ,\nK1\nK 1K 2\n\n(3)\nwhich implies that\n2<\n\nK H CO 3\npCO 2 =\n.\nK 1K 2 100 pH\n\n(4)\n\n3\n\n\fPearson and Palmer hold \u0002CO2 constant so that pCO2 \u0003 [H+], while Caldeira and Berner\nhold [CO32 ] constant so that pCO2 \u0003 [H+]2.\n\u0001\n\nEqs. (2) and (4) are two simple proportionality relations between pCO2 and pH. If one\nnow chooses the proportionality constants such that each relation gives the assumed preindustrial pH of 8.25 at the pre-industrial pCO2 value of 280 ppmv and plots the result,\none obtains Fig. 1. Note the nonlinearity of both curves. They are nonlinear for the\nassumption of either constant carbonate-ion concentration or constant total dissolved\ninorganic carbon concentration. This nonlinear response of pH to changes in atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide partial pressure will be of the greatest importance in the next section,\nwhere the validity of either assumption will also be evaluated.\n\nFigure 1. Partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide as a function of\npH assuming a pH of 8.25 at a pCO2=280 ppmv for both curves. Adapted\nfrom K. Caldeira and R. Berner, Science 286, 2043 (1999).\nTime series data from Ocean Station Aloha\nTime series data from about the mid-1950s to today are available from Ocean Station\nAloha in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. The surface ocean pH data, available from\n1990, show an average pH decrease of ~0.03 units. A linear fit made to these data by\nFeely, et al. [5] resulted in the relation\n\n4\n\n\fpH(Year date) = 11.815 \u0001 1.9 \u00d7 10 3\u0095\u2022(Year date).\n\u0001\n\n(5)\nFor example, pH(2008) = 11.815 \u0001 1.9 \u00d7 10 3\u0095\u2022(2008) = 7.99. The data are shown in Fig.\n\u0001\n\n2. Note that if one uses this linear fit to pH data, the pre-industrial value of pH = 8.25\noccurs for the year 1876.\n\nFigure 2. Atmospheric carbon dioxide from Mauna Loa (ppmv) and\npCO2 (\u03bcatm), and surface ocean pH time series data from Ocean Station\nAloha. From Feely, et al. PICES Press 16(1), 22-26 (2008).\nThe Royal Society report [1], referencing Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow [6], maintains that if\nthere is \u0093\"no mixing with the deeper oceans . . . it is predicted that pH will fall to below\n7.9 by 2100\u0094\". If one uses Eq. (5) with the date year of 2100, one obtains pH(2100) = 7.8.\nThe Royal Society pH estimate for 2100 is thus consistent with a linear extrapolation of\nthe eighteen years of data from Ocean Station Aloha. Such an extrapolation would\nappear to be unwarranted or questionable at best. As can be seen from Fig. 1, there is no\nreason to think the response over the next more than ninety years will be linear.\nAccording to the Ocean Station Aloha data, current pH(2008) \u0001 8.08. For pH = 8.08, the\nCaldeira and Berner relation shown in Fig. 1 gives a value for pCO2 of 613 ppmv, and\nthat of Pearson and Palmer a value of 413 ppmv. The actual value today is ~384 ppmv.\nThe discrepancy shows that even if the assumption of constant carbonate ion\n\n5\n\n\fconcentration or constant total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration can be justified\non theoretical grounds, other factors must be involved.\nCaldeira and Wickett [7] project a maximum pH reduction in 2300 of 0.77 units for an\natmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide of 1900 ppmv. The latter results from the\nburning of all fossil-fuel sources estimated at 5,270 GtC. The 0.77 unit reduction in pH\ncould mean either from the pre-industrial value of 8.25 or the current value of 8.08. The\nformer gives a pH of 7.48 and the latter a pH of 7.31. Using Eq. (5) again, one obtains\npH(2300) = 7.44. So again, the eighteen years of Ocean Station Aloha or similar data\nappear to have been linearly extrapolated out to 2300. This is even more questionable\nthan a linear extrapolation to 2100.\nThe Ocean Station Aloha data imply that the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide\nconcentration is affecting ocean pH. Geographically diverse data would strengthen the\ncase for this argument. However, the current level of understanding of the mixing of\nsurface water with the deep ocean (discussed in the next section), and the relation of\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to ocean surface water pH, is not adequate for\ncentennial or longer ocean pH projections. In addition, current extrapolations do not take\ninto account rising water temperature or the response of the biosphere. After all, the\nbiological pump is responsible for some three-quarters of the surface to deep-ocean\ngradient in dissolved inorganic carbon [8].\nOcean mixing times\nThe Royal Society report assumed no surface water mixing with the deeper oceans. How\njustified is this assumption? As mentioned earlier, carbon dioxide is generally assumed\nto mix with the deep ocean on a time scale of about 300 years. This is perhaps long\nenough to justify not taking ocean mixing into account for projections for the next\ncentury or so. But how well is this time scale known?\nDeep ocean circulation and mixing is difficult to measure directly, and is generally based\non hydrographic measurements such as salinity that give little or no information on rates.\n\n6\n\n\fFortunately, there exist transient tracers such as tritium from nuclear weapons testing in\nthe Pacific Ocean during the late 1950s and early 1960s, peaking in 1963. High tritium\nreadings are now found in the deep Atlantic, and as put by Doney [9], \u0093\"the deep western\nboundary current is quite \u0091'leaky\u0092': tritium and other tracers introduced into the boundary\ncurrent are rapidly lost to the interior by turbulent mixing and/or recirculation . . .These\nresults have important implications for understanding the response of the deep North\nAtlantic to climatic variability on decadal time scales and the invasion of anthropogenic\npollutants (e.g. greenhouse CO2) into the deep ocean.\u0094\"\nJenkins and Smethie, Jr. [10] find a 1 Tritium Unit isosurface, below which the seawater\nhas not mixed with tritium and above which it has in the 15 to 20 years between the bomb\ntests and the survey upon which their article is based. This isosurface lies at depths of\n500 to 1,000 meters in the subtropics, but drops to 1,500 to 2,000 meters just south of the\nGulf Stream off the New England coast. Near Bermuda, tritium reached the intermediate\ndepths of 1,000-1,500 meters in the late 1970s, and depths of 2,000-2,500 meters in the\nlate 1980s. In the north, the isosurface is at the ocean floor. Jenkins and Smethie, Jr.\nforcefully state the implications: \u0093\"The track along which this happens parallels the Gulf\nStream Extension North Atlantic Drift. All the waters north of this line have been\nventilated to the ocean floor on 10 to 20 year time scales. This is a powerful statement\nregarding the time scales of ocean ventilation, and has profound implications concerning\nhow rapidly climatic variations can propagate through the oceans\u0094\".\nConclusion\nA good deal of research and wide area monitoring is needed before the understanding of\nthe effects of rising carbon dioxide concentration on ocean pH will allow projections\nadequate to guide public policy decisions. Future research needs and strategies have been\ndetailed in the June 2006 report of an 18-20 April 2005 workshop sponsored by the\nNational Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and\nthe U.S. Geological Survey [11].\n\n7\n\n\fAPPENDIX\nSeawater Response to Increased Carbon Dioxide\nAn increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide will rapidly increase the partial pressure of\nthis gas in the surface waters of the ocean. This in turn will cause surface seawater to\nbecome more acidic via the reaction\nH2O + (CO2)aq + CO32 \u0002 2HCO3 .\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n(A1)\nThis is seen in Figure A1. The relationships shown in Fig. A1 holds for increases of\ncarbon dioxide over a relatively short time.\n\nFigure A1. Total dissolved CO2 and CO32 concentration as a function of\nthe partial pressure of CO2. Surface sea water at 24 oC, salinity 35 per mil,\nand an alkalinity of 2.3 milliequivalent per kilogram. Adapted from\nBroecker, et al. Science 206, 409-418 (1979).\n\u0001\n\nMarine organisms form calcium carbonate in two forms: aragonite and calcite,\npolymorphs of crystalline CaCO3.\n\nBoth forms will dissolve unless the surrounding\n\nseawater is saturated with respect to the concentration of carbonate ions CO32 . The\n\u0001\n\naragonite and calcite saturation levels are indicated in Fig. A1.\nIn the distant past, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were much higher than\ncurrent values and yet coral reefs thrived. This is despite the fact that ocean pH levels\n8\n\n\fhave varied between 7.4 and 8.3 and the lowest values correlate with high carbon dioxide\nlevels. The key to understanding this is that carbon dioxide concentrations changed over\nperiods of time long enough to allow mixing with the deeper parts of the ocean. It is\ngenerally believed that this mixing takes about 300 years, while the acidity resulting from\ndissolved carbon dioxide is partially neutralized by carbonate minerals over a period\n~6000 years [12]. Ocean mixing time is a critical parameter for estimating the effect of\nrising carbon dioxide levels on the ocean, and has been discussed above.\nThere is some experimental evidence that, rather than pH, the calcification rate of corals\nresponds to the combination of Ca2+ and CO32 variations. Langdon, et al. [13] have\n\u0002\n\nshown that for an experimental coral reef, variations in Ca2+ and CO32 appear to affect\n\u0002\n\nmarine calcification rates more or less according to the relation\n\n1 =\n\nCa\n\n2+\n\n2<\n\nCO 3\n*\n\nK sp\n\n.\n\n(A2)\n\u0001 is known as the saturation state and K*sp is the solubility product for either calcite or\naragonite. As seawater pH declines as a result rising carbon dioxide concentrations, the\nconcentration of CO32 will also fall reducing the calcium carbonate saturation state.\n\u0002\n\nLangdon, et al. caution however that the control of calcification in corals and marine\ncalcareous algae by saturation state requires additional verification.\nThe Royal Society report [1] includes Figure A2 below, showing the relative proportions\nof HCO3 , CO32 , and CO2 dissolved in seawater.\n\u0002\n\n\u0002\n\n9\n\n\fFigure A2. Relative proportions of dissolved inorganic forms\nof carbon dioxide in seawater. The narrow range 7.5 < pH <\n8.5 of pH likely to be found in the oceans at any time is\nindicated by the arrows at the top of the figure. From the\nRoyal Society report [1].\nThere are three basic reactions, in addition to Henry\u0092's law, that will be needed for what\nfollows. The unconventional symbol \u0001 will be used in equilibrium relations since the\nusual half arrow forward over a half arrow back is unavailable. The first reaction is then\n\nCO 2 + H 2O \u008b H 2CO 3.\n(A3)\nHenry\u0092's law is\n\npCO 2 = K H H 2CO 3 ,\n(A4)\nwhere the constant KH ~ 29 (atmos\u0095\u2022l/mole). Note that here and in the first dissociation\nconstant for carbonic acid, it is customary for [H2CO3] to include dissolved CO2 gas as\nwell as the concentration of H2CO3.\nThe second basic reaction along with the first dissociation constant for carbonic acid is\n\n10\n\n\f+\n\n+\n\n<\n3\n\nH 2CO 3 \u008b H + HCO ,\n\n<\n\nH HCO 3\n.\nH 2CO 3\n\nK1 =\n\n(A5)\nThe third reaction and the second dissociation constant is given by\n\n<\n3\n\n+\n\n2<\n3\n\nHCO \u008b H + CO ,\n\nH\n\nK2 =\n\n+\n\n2<\n\nCO 3\n<\n\nHCO 3\n\n.\n\n(A6)\nThese reactions show that atmospheric carbon dioxide in its gaseous form is absorbed\ninto seawater according to Henry\u0092's law where it reacts with water to form carbonic acid.\nSome of the carbonic acid dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. A portion of\nthe bicarbonate ions dissociate into additional hydrogen and carbonate ions.\n\nThese\n\nreactions are reversible and have associated equilibrium constants. At a pH of ~8.1,\nabout 90% of the carbon is in the form of bicarbonate ions, 9% in the form of carbonate\nions, and 1% in the form of dissolved carbon dioxide.\nMarine carbonates also react with carbon dioxide through the reaction\n<\n\n2+\n\nCO 2 + CaCO 3 + H 2O \u008b 2HCO 3 + Ca .\n\n(A7)\nThis reaction depends on the calcium carbonate saturation state; i.e., the degree of\nseawater saturation with respect to calcite and aragonite. Since the ratio of calcium to\nsalinity only varies by a few percent, variations in CO32 to Ksp* are primarily responsible\n\u0001\n\nfor the saturation state [see Eq. (A2)]. Unless sufficient CO32 is present, CaCO3 will\n\u0001\n\ndissolve back into the surrounding seawater. This creates a \u0093\"saturation horizon\u0094\" for\ncalcite and aragonite, below which CaCO3 cannot form.\nDerivation of the relationship between pH and pCO2\nThe relation between pH and pCO2 is crucial for understanding the future impact of rising\ncarbon dioxide concentrations on the ocean. Without this understanding, it is impossible\nto reliably project seawater pH into the future, particularly beyond a decade or two. Two\n11\n\n\fapproaches, which were developed to estimate the pH of Middle Eocene seawater, will be\nderived here.\nThe first and second dissociation constants in Eqs. (A5) and (A6) tell us that\n2<\n\n<\n\nCO 3 + HCO 3\nK 1K 2\nK1\n=\n.\n+ +\n+ 2\nH 2CO 3\nH\nH\n\n(A8)\nAdding 1 =\n\nH 2CO 3\nH 2CO 3\n\nto both sides of this equation results in\n\n2<\n\n<\n\nCO 3 + HCO 3 + H 2CO 3\nK 1K 2\nK1\n1+\n=\n.\n+ +\n+ 2\nH 2CO 3\nH\nH\n\n(A9)\nNow the numerator on the r.h.s. of this equation is the total concentration of dissolved\ninorganic carbon in seawater. Calling this sum \u0002CO2, and using Henry\u0092's law, results in\n<1\n\npCO 2 = K H H 2CO 3 = K H 1 +\n\nK 1K 2\nK1\n+ +\n+ 2\nH\nH\n\nYCO 2.\n\n(A10)\nThis is the relation given by Pearson and Palmer [3] in their footnote 32 for estimating\npCO2 as a function of hydrogen ion concentration and total dissolved carbon. A relation\nbetween pH and pCO2 can be obtained by remembering that pH = \u0001log[H+], or [H+] = 10\n\n\u0001\n\npH\n\n. Using this in Eq. (A10) results in\n\npCO 2 =\n\nK H YCO 2\npH\n2pH .\n1 + K 110 + K 1K 210\n\n(A11)\nOrder of magnitude estimates of the dissociation constants imply that only the second\nterm in the denominator of the r.h.s. is of importance. This results in the relation\n12\n\n\fpCO 2 =\n\nK H YCO 2\npH .\nK 110\n\n(A12)\nIn their estimates for pCO2 as a function of pH, Pearson and Palmer hold total dissolved\ncarbon constant.\nThere is an alternative relation that can be derived from Henry\u0092's law and Eqs. (A5) and\n(A6). By simple substitution, one has\n\npCO 2 =\n\nKH\n<\n2<\n+\n+ 2\nKH\nH HCO 3 =\nH CO 3 .\nK1\nK 1K 2\n\n(A13)\nCaldeira and Berner [4] used this form when objecting to Pearson and Palmer\u0092's\nassumption that total dissolved carbon should be held constant and instead suggested that\n[CO32 ] should be held constant.\n\u0001\n\nEquation (A13) may also be used to derive a relation between pH and pCO2. Taking the\nlog of both sides of Eq. (A13) and doing a little manipulation results in\n2<\n\nK H CO 3\npCO 2 =\n.\nK 1K 2 100 pH\n\n(A14)\nEquations (A12) and (A14) are the same as Eqs. (2) and (4) in the second section of this\npaper.\n\n13\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] \u0093\"Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide\u0094\", Policy document\n12/05 (June 2005).
