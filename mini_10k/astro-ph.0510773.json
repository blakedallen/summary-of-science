The inner parts of TXS 0818+214 and TXS 1312+563 could be interpreted as double-lobed, and\nconsequently, these sources could be of the double-double type; but further multifrequency observations are necessary to provide support for\nsuch an interpretation.\nKey words. Radio continuum: galaxies, Galaxies: active\n\n1. Introduction\nFirm observational evidence now exists that a galaxy, regardless of its state of activity, hosts a supermassive black hole\n(SMBH, see e.g. Barth, 2003, and references therein). If a significant amount of matter in the vicinity of the SMBH accretes\nonto it, the galaxy appears to be active, but for how long does\nthis activity occur? Can an inactive galaxy become active and\nvice versa, and is repeated switching between active and inactive states possible? Radio observations can perhaps give some\nanswers to these questions because the lobes in radio-loud\nAGNs partly provide a historical record of past activity. From\ndetailed measurements of the spectral indices of their lobes, the\nspectral ages of extended radio sources can be inferred that, according to Alexander & Leahy (1987) and Liu et al. (1992), are\nof the order of \u223c107 to 108 years. However, as discussed in detail by Scheuer (1995), double-lobed radio sources are known\nto expand with velocities about a few percent of the speed\nof light; consequently the overall linear sizes of these sources\nmust be of the order of 105 to 106 pc. This agrees with obserSend\noffprint\nrequests\namr@astro.uni.torun.pl\n\nto:\n\nAndrzej\n\nMarecki\n\ne-mail:\n\nvations and the fact that some radio galaxies \u2013 they are termed\nGiant Radio Galaxies (GRGs) \u2013 may have sizes \u2265 1 Mpc1 . As\nthe spectral ages of radio galaxies, even GRGs, are thought to\nbe two orders of magnitude less than their actual ages, which, in\nturn, can be about the same age as the Universe (Pasquini et al.,\n2004), it would appear that activity phenomena are episodic:\nthey can be started at an arbitrary stage in the evolution of the\ngalaxy and can cease or become interrupted after a certain period of time.\nIf the energy supply from the central engine to the hotspots\nand the lobes of a radio-loud AGN cuts off, it enters a socalled \"coasting phase\". It can remain at this stage of its evolution for up to 108 years, and its spectrum would become very\nsteep due to radiation and expansion losses during this period\n(Komissarov & Gubanov, 1994; Slee et al., 2001). On the other\nhand, as first pointed out by Hargrave & Ryle (1974), the radia1\nFor consistency with numerous papers on GRGs (e.g.\nSchoenmakers et al., 1999, 2000a,b,c; Kaiser et al., 2000; Lara et al.,\n2001) H0 =50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 = 0.5 is used throughout this\npaper. For these cosmological parameters the redshift value of\nz = 1.25 provides the maximum linear size for a given angular size:\n1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 8.6 kpc.\n\n\f2\n\nA. Marecki et al.: Signatures of restarted activity in FIRST radio sources\n\ntive lifetimes of the relativistic electrons in the hotspots are of\nthe order of only 104 years. Therefore, the lack of fuelling in radio sources that have switched off \u2013 they are sometimes termed\n\"faders\" \u2013 should result in the absence of the hotspots as they\nshould have faded away relatively quickly. A few objects of\nthis kind have been observed in samples of ultra-steep spectrum sources (R\u00f6ttgering et al., 1994; De Breuck et al., 2000)\nor as a part of very low frequency surveys (Cohen et al., 2004;\nMack et al., 2005).\nAlthough it is obvious that total disappearance should normally be the ultimate stage in the evolution of a fader, it is\nalso clear that under certain circumstances a new period of activity could begin during the \"coasting phase\", i.e. before the\nlobes have faded out completely. An observable effect of this\nwould be the presence of new, bright components located in or\nstraddling the centre of a larger, double-lobed relic structure.\nThe signature of such renewed activity is most convincing if\nit takes the form of a smaller, also double-lobed radio source\ngiving rise to a so-called double-double radio galaxy \u2013 DDRG\n(Lara et al., 1999; Schoenmakers et al., 2000a,b). According to\nthe theory developed by Kaiser et al. (2000) \u2013 hereafter KSR \u2013\none of the most noticeable features of DDRGs is that they are\nlarge-size radio objects (>\n\u223c 700 kpc) because recurrent activity cannot be observed in radio structures that are significantly\nsmaller than GRGs. The reason for this is that \u223c5\u00d7107 years are\nrequired to refill the cocoon with matter from warm clouds of\ngas embedded in the hot Intergalactic Medium (IGM) passing\nthrough the bow shock surrounding the outer source structure.\nOtherwise, the gas densities within the cocoon are insufficient\nfor the development of new shocks/hotspots.\nIn spite of this, an attempt was made to search for signatures of restarted activity in radio sources with sizes less than\nthose of GRGs. This is important because, if DDRGs with linear sizes considerably below 1 Mpc do exist, modification of\nthe theory of KSR would appear inevitable. In Sect. 2 a procedure is presented to search for candidates that are potentially\nrestarted objects with sizes below 1 Mpc. Using this procedure\na small sample of such objects was constructed and observed\nwith MERLIN at 5 GHz (Sect. 3). The results are discussed in\nSect. 4 and summarised in Sect. 5.\n\n2. A search for restarted objects in the FIRST\nsurvey\nRadio sources with extended emission, whose structures have\nbeen clearly imaged in the Faint Images of Radio Sky at Twenty\ncentimetres (FIRST) survey (White et al., 1997)2 , have angular\nsizes of the order of a few arcminutes and therefore linear sizes\nless than \u22481 Mpc, regardless of their redshifts. Consequently,\nan initial systematic search through the FIRST catalogue for\ntriple sources with a dominant core would yield objects with\nsizes less than 1 Mpc, which could form a list of candidates for\nobjects showing signatures of restarted activity.\nAn automatic procedure was developed for this. In the first\nphase of this procedure, a source within FIRST with a flux\ndensity greater than a particular limit (75 mJy) was selected\n2\n\nOfficial website: http://sundog.stsci.edu\n\nand a pair of \"secondary\" sources (the \"lobes\") were sought\nwithin a 2\u2032 radius of the initially selected source (the \"core\").\nAn aligned triple was assumed to have been detected if the angle lobe1 \u2013 core \u2013 lobe2 was greater than 165\u25e6 and the peak\nflux densities of the \"lobes\" were less than 30% of that of the\n\"core\". This was repeated for all the sources in FIRST with flux\ndensities that were greater than the limit. The 30% threshold\nwas somewhat arbitrary, but was based upon an initial, extensive visual inspection of FIRST maps: the peak flux densities\nof the lobes in the vast majority of sources with the required\nmorphology fell well below that limit anyway. No lower limit\nfor the flux density of the FIRST components of relic lobes was\nimposed. The sources of this kind are labelled core-dominated\ntriples (CDTs) throughout this paper.\nAs a next step, 5-GHz flux densities of the selected sources\nwere obtained from the GB6 survey (Becker et al., 1991), and\nthose sources with flux densities below 40 mJy were rejected.\nAlso rejected were those whose spectral indices calculated\nfrom the FIRST and GB6 flux densities were: \u03b1 < 0.5 (S \u221d\n\u03bd\u2212\u03b1 ). The 5-GHz flux density limit was adopted to ensure that\nhigh signal to noise images of the \"cores\" would result from\nMERLIN follow-up observations at that frequency. (The aforementioned 75 mJy limit at 1.4 GHz resulted from the 5-GHz\nflux density limit and the spectral index criterion.) The sample was limited to objects with steep spectra to maximise the\nprobability that the \"cores\" themselves, which mainly contribute to the total flux density, were likely to have steep spectra3 . Generic core-jet sources, which typically have flat spectra,\nwere possibly eliminated in this way.\nThis automated procedure was carried out using the version of the FIRST catalogue dated 15 October 2001 (the most\nrecent at the time the project began) covering approximately\n7954 square degrees in the north Galactic cap and 611 square\ndegrees in the south Galactic cap, and containing \u223c771,000\nsources. It follows that with the GB6 covering only the northern hemisphere, our sample is also limited in the same manner. It yielded 313 sources; their maps were extracted from the\nFIRST archive and inspected visually. It turned out that the majority of the alleged triple structures were typically compact\nobjects surrounded by symmetric artefacts originating from the\nVLA diffraction pattern that is typical of snapshot mode observations. These were rejected and a final sample of 15 sources\nresulted from the whole selection process. Their names, coordinates, flux densities at 1.4 GHz and 4.85 GHz, and spectral\nindices between these two are shown in Table 1.\nThe approach described above is somewhat complementary to the one of Schoenmakers et al. (2000c) and Lara et al.\n(2001). These authors searched for GRGs in WENSS and\nNVSS, respectively, and their selection criteria included a\nlower limit to the sources' angular sizes, which was 5\u2032 and 4\u2032 ,\nrespectively.

Overview\nThe MERLIN full-track, phase-referenced observations at\n5 GHz were carried out for the sample of 15 sources during\nthe period 16 Feb. \u2013 1 Jun. 2004. 3C286 was used as the flux\ndensity and polarisation calibrator, and OQ208 was used as the\n\nDistance from\nthe 'core' [\u2032\u2032 ]\n21.0\n-\n18.4\n\npoint source calibrator. The flux density of 3C286 on the VLA\nscale, which was used, was 7.331 Jy. The initial editing and\ncalibration of the data were carried out using the Jodrell Bank\nd-programmes, and preliminary phase-referenced images were\nproduced using the AIPS based PIPELINE procedure developed at Jodrell Bank. Further cycles of phase self-calibration\nand imaging using the AIPS tasks CALIB and IMAGR were\nthen used to produce the final images.\nAs indicated in Table 1, two of the five weakest sources\nof the sample with GB6 flux densities below 50 mJy \u2013\nTXS 1024+549 and TXS 1025+089 \u2013 were not detected at the\n\n\f4\n\nA.

Another two of these five \u2013 TXS 1046+187 and\nFIRST J155726.1+360133 \u2013 were only marginally detected;\ni.e. some diffuse structures appear at the 3\u03c3 level corresponding to 300\u03bcJy/beam and 390\u03bcJy/beam, respectively. The lack of\nany distinct features in their MERLIN images is probably the\nresult of the diffuse structures being resolved. Seven sources\nappeared to be unresolved or barely resolved. They are listed\nas \"single\" in Table 1 and will not be discussed further here.\nThe remaining four targets, listed in Table 2, have well resolved structures consisting of more than one component. Their\nMERLIN images are presented and comments on them given\nin Sect. 3.2. The flux densities of the components shown in\nthese images were measured using the AIPS task JMFIT and\nare listed in Table 3.\n\n3.2. Notes on individual sources\nTXS 0818+214. This object was included in Release 4 of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS/DR4)4 as a mR = 21.73\ngalaxy; but its redshift was not known, and it could not be found\nin the literature. Based both on the r-z Hubble diagram as derived by e.g. Thompson et al. (1994) and on the given magnitude, an estimated redshift would be z \u2248 1.0. The MERLIN\nimage of the \"core\" of the source (Fig. 1, right panel) shows it\nas a double located at P.A.= \u221240\u25e6 . Given that the two components are asymmetric \u2013 the northwestern one is appreciably more compact than the southeastern one \u2013 it could be\nthat the subarcsecond-scale structure is a core-jet type. The\napproximate alignment between the subarcsecond-scale and\narcminute-scale structures (Fig. 1) agrees with this. However,\ndespite the compactness of the northwestern component, it and\nthe southeastern part of the source could still be regarded as\ntwo FR II-type (Fanaroff & Riley, 1974) lobes. No measurable\npolarisation was observed with MERLIN. Thus, only a detailed\nstudy of their spectral indices based on the present data and future observations of the source at a lower frequency and with\na similar resolution might determine which is the correct interpretation. However, if the two components are actually lobes\nand given that the redshift estimate for this source translates to\na linear size <\n\u223c 586 kpc, such a linear size would be somewhat\nless than the minimum for a double-double source required by\nthe KSR model (\u2248700 kpc). The sizes quoted above are not\nlikely to be underestimated, as 586 kpc would result from an\nassumption of z = 1.25 and so it is the maximum possible linear size for the observed angular size (68\u2032\u2032 ) and the adopted\ncosmological model. Therefore, if the double-double morphology is confirmed, it would appear that the KSR model would\nneed to be modified to become applicable to TXS 0818+214.\n4\n\nThis is the most recent release at the time of writing.\n\n\fA.

Fig. 3 shows a 1\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 (approx.) cutout from\nthe SDSS/DR4 archive centred on the brightest (\"core\") component of TXS 1033+026 seen in the FIRST image (Fig. 2, left\npanel). In the optical domain it is also the brightest feature in\nthis field: a \"fuzzy\" object with two emission peaks in its very\ncentre and an arc-like structure emerging from there towards\nthe northeast and bent so that it eventually points to the southeast. There are also two regularly shaped galaxies in the field:\nSDSS J103631.50+022201.9 with mR = 17.84 located 18\u2032\u2032 to\n\nthe north of the centre and SDSS J103633.24+022120.6 with\nmR = 17.63 located 32\u2032\u2032 to the southeast of the centre. Neither\nof these has a known redshift nor a radio counterpart in the\nFIRST image.\nAccording to SDSS/DR4, one of the optical peaks,\nSDSS J103631.95+022145.7 (ObjId=587726032776265858),\nis coincident within 0.\u2032\u2032 4 with the \"core\" of the FIRST source,\nbut its redshift is not listed there, nor could it be found in the literature. The second optical peak, SDSS J103631.87+022144.0\n(ObjId=587726032776265859), which is 1.\u2032\u2032 67 off the position\nof the radio source, is a galaxy CGCG 037\u2212089 whose redshift,\nz = 0.050276, has been listed in the SDSS archive. At this redshift an angular distance of 2\u2032\u2032 , which is the distance between\nthe two optical maxima, corresponds to 2.7 kpc. At such a short\n(projected) distance, one would expect these two objects to be\nstrongly interacting. Together with the presence of the arc-like\nstructure closely resembling e.g. those in the \"Antennae\" galaxies, the observed structure is perhaps evidence that a merger is\ntaking place.\nThe arcminute-scale structure of the radio source as shown\nin the FIRST image (Fig. 2, left panel) could be viewed in\nmore than one way. It could be considered as a very asymmetric triple with a central core, a lobe to the southeast, and\na jet almost pointing in a northwesterly direction to a second\nlobe \u22433.5 times farther away from the core than the southeastern lobe. At the redshift given above, the projected size of the\nsource would be 141 kpc. It could also be that the component\nlocated at RA= 10h 36m 28s, Dec= 02\u25e6 22\u2032 30\u2032\u2032 (J2000) is not associated with the main source, but is a coincidence. In this case,\n1033+026 could still be regarded as a CDT with the protrusion\nfrom the core to the northwest being the lobe. The linear size\nof the triple would then shrink to 72.6 kpc.\nThe principal features of the subarcsecond-scale structure\nseen in the MERLIN image (Fig. 2, right panel) are a core and\n\n\f6\n\nA.

In addition, the \"remains\" of flux\nto the southeast and to northwest of the core (i.e. the directions\nof the two lobes or lobe and jet visible in the FIRST image),\nwhich have been mostly resolved by MERLIN, are also visible. The jet is at an angle of \u2248 80\u25e6 relative to the direction\nof the southeastern lobe in the FIRST image. No measurable\npolarisation has been observed for this source with MERLIN.\n\nTXS 1308+011. This source is identified with a QSO at a redshift z = 1.075 (Hewett et al., 1995). The projected linear size\nis therefore 420 kpc. The MERLIN image (Fig. 4, right panel)\nindicates that in the subarcsecond scale the central component\nseen in the FIRST image is a core-jet type source with the\nnorthern component, which appears to be unresolved, being the\ncore. The inner core-jet structure has a linear size of 3.8 kpc\nwith the jet initially pointing to the southeast at P.A.\u2248\u221217\u25e6 and\n\n\fA. Marecki et al.: Signatures of restarted activity in FIRST radio sources\n\nthen bending away from its 55\u25e6 misalignment relative to the\nFIRST image structure towards a southwesterly direction, i.e.\ninto the direction of the lobe in the FIRST image. Significant\npolarisation occurs where the jet is bending. There is no indication of a counter-jet to the north of the core, which is perhaps not visible as it is moving away from the observer. From\nthe symmetry of the FIRST image, one might expect that any\ncounter-jet would perhaps bend towards the northeastern component. If all the morphological features suggested above were\nactually observed, TXS 1308+011 could be regarded as an \"Zshaped\" radio source analogous to TXS 1346+268 (also known\nas 4C +26.42, van Breugel et al., 1984) and a helical jet or precessing jet model might be applied to it.\nThe phenomenon of a misalignment between the milliarcsecond- and arcsecond-scale structures has been thoroughly\ninvestigated; see Appl et al. (1996) for a review. Based on a\nlarge collection of observational material, they have concluded\nthat, although it is possible to apply a helical jet model to individual sources, it is difficult to find a single mechanism responsible for the observed distribution of misalignments, which\nshows a statistically significant peak at \u2206PA \u2243 90\u25e6 . This peak\nis particularly well-defined for BL Lac objects, but EVN and\nMERLIN observations of bent radio jets in some BL Lac objects (Cassaro et al., 2002) do not support a helical jet explanation of misalignments close to 90\u25e6 . Thus, although an interpretation of the morphology based on a twisted jet model\ncan be argued \u2013 it has been for example for TXS 1055+018\n(Attridge et al., 1999) \u2013 adopting a scenario of a central engine\nrepositioning leads to a simple and natural explanation without\ncomplex modelling. Therefore, the restarted activity scenario is\nnot ruled out for TXS 1308+011.\nTXS 1312+563. According to SDSS/DR4, this source is identified with a QSO at a redshift z = 1.751. The projected linear\nsize is therefore 327 kpc. The MERLIN image (Fig. 5, right\npanel) of the arcminute-scale \"core\" component shows it as a\ndouble source located at P.A.\u2248\u22125\u25e6 with a linear size of 8 kpc.\nThe northern component is very compact and is not resolved\nby MERLIN, but the degree of its polarisation is appreciable:\n2.8%. The southern component resembles an FR II lobe and is\nstrongly polarised (7.1%) in the same direction as the northern one. As in the case of TXS 0818+214, without spectral index data it is not possible to classify the inner structure of this\nsource, which could be either of a core-lobe type as hinted by\nthe morphology or a double-lobe type as suggested by the polarisation properties.\nThere is a 30\u25e6 misalignment of the subarcsecond-scale\ndouble relative to the arcminute-scale triple structure (Fig. 5,\nleft panel). It should be noted that a very similar misalignment has been observed in the double-double GRG 1245+676\n(Marecki et al., 2003). Thus, a hypothesis that TXS 1312+563\ncould be of a double-double type cannot be ruled out, and if\nconfirmed, the estimate for the linear size of TXS 1312+563,\nwhich is well below the \u2248700 kpc limit required by the KSR,\nwould indicate that their theory, unless modified, might not be\napplicable to this object.\n\n7\n\n4. Discussion\nAs already mentioned in Sect. 1, Lara et al. (1999) and\nSchoenmakers et al. (2000a,b) have identified a number\nof radio sources where the interruption of activity has\nhad a spectacular impact on their double-double morphologies. J0116\u221247 (Saripalli et al., 2002), PKS B1545\u2212321\n(Saripalli et al., 2003), and SGRS J2159\u22127219 (Saripalli et al.,\n2005) are also clear examples of restarted DDRGs. Three\nother sources investigated by Saripalli et al. (2005) \u2013 SGRS\nJ0143\u22125431, J0746\u22125702, and J1946\u22128222 \u2013 show evidence\nof either one- or two-sided knots/jets closer to the nucleus and\nmight be examples of giant radio sources with relic lobes and\nrestarting beams.\nAnother well-known type of a dramatic event in the evolution of a radio-loud AGN that may be labelled \"restarted\nactivity\" can also lead to the development of an X-shaped\nradio source (Rottmann, 2001, and references therein). It\nis to be noted that typical X-shaped sources, such as\n3C 223.1 or 3C 403 (Dennett-Thorpe et al., 2002; Capetti et al.,\n2002), in principle resemble DDRGs like J0116\u2212473 or\nPKS B1545\u2212321 except for the misalignment between the active (inner) and the inactive (outer) parts. Thus, it might be\nspeculated that the mechanism that triggered the development\nof the new structures in these two kinds of objects is the\nsame, but that DDRGs are just \"special cases\" where the misalignment is (close to) zero. However, the opposite suggestion,\nnamely that different mechanisms could be responsible for activity renewal in each type of object, appears to be more justified at the present time. A review of several possible mechanisms has been given by Schoenmakers et al. (2000a).\nMergers seem to be the most \"natural\" explanation of activity re-ignition, but if the angular momentum of the infalling\ngas is different from that of the pre-existing accretion disk,\nwhich is what would normally be expected5, a fast realignment of the jet axis might occur and an X-shaped source could\nemerge (KSR). Merritt & Ekers (2002) show that the orientation of a black hole spin axis would change dramatically even\nin a minor merger, leading to an almost instantaneous reorientation of the coalescing SMBHs and a sudden flip in the direction of the jets. Liu (2004) suggests that the realignment\nof a rotating SMBH with a misaligned accretion disk is due\nto the Bardeen-Petterson effect (Bardeen & Petterson, 1975)\nand that the timescale of such a realignment is < 105 years.\nIt follows that the change of the direction of the jets is\nabrupt compared with the typical age of the radio sources\n(Komissarov & Gubanov, 1994).\nHowever, it is to be noted, that, although mergers seem\nto be the simplest explanation of activity re-ignition, an alternative model based upon the existence of thermal-viscous\ninstabilities in the accretion disks of AGNs has been pro5\n\nConsequently, well-aligned DDRGs should be exceptional. However, Liu et al. (2003) point out that if the mass ratio of the two merging black holes is in the range 0.01 to 0.4, realignment of the central engine and the subsequent formation of an X-shaped radio structure are not inevitable, and so the above-mentioned speculation that\nDDRGs can be regarded as \"zero-misalignment\" X-shaped sources\ncould still be a viable scenario.\n\n\f8\n\nA. Marecki et al.: Signatures of restarted activity in FIRST radio sources\n\nposed (Hatziminaoglou et al., 2001, and references therein).\nAccording to Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. (2005), Marecki et al.\n(2006), and Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. (2006), this model\ncould explain the existence of sources in which activity has\nceased, but this does not preclude the possibility that the same\nmechanism could be responsible not only for a cessation but\nalso for a re-ignition of activity.\nThe most outstanding feature of both DDRGs and Xshaped sources is that they are large \u2013 their linear sizes exceed 700 kpc \u2013 which indicates that they have to be particularly\nold for activity renewal regardless of their morphological features. The apparent lack of observable double-double structures\nin small-scale sources could mean that specific conditions are\nrequired for activity re-ignition, which do exist in GRGs, but\nwhich make it rare if not impossible for such a phenomenon\nto occur in more compact objects. It could be that the physical\nconditions inside the cocoon might not favour the development\nof the inner lobes for a long time after the initial burst of the activity. According to KSR, that timescale could be up to \u223c5\u00d7107\nyears so that, even if the activity in a source younger than that\ncould actually cease and than restart, such an event would remain unobservable.\nWhile the above currently appears to be the case for\nDDRGs without exception, X-shaped sources with linear sizes\nsignificantly below 1 Mpc may exist. Two examples of such\nsources \u2013 TXS 0229+131 (Murphy et al., 1993) and 4C +01.30\n(Wang et al., 2003) \u2013 can be found in the literature. The arms\nof TXS 0229+131 (z = 2.059) have lengths in the range 100\n\u2013 120 kpc. (The strange appearance of TXS 0229+131 could\nin principle result from gravitational lensing but according to\nBrowne, priv. comm., it is very unlikely.) The \"active\" and\n\"relic\" arms of 4C +01.30 (z = 0.132) are 160 and 300 kpc\nin length, respectively.\nThe conspicuous X-shaped structures observed in some\nMpc-scale radio sources and the two more compact ones mentioned above require a lack of almost any distortions caused by\norientation effects. In other words, both arms of the cross must\nlie close to the sky plane for sources to be observed as such. If\nsuch an exceptional orientation is not present, Doppler boosting\nand beaming effects would distort the X-shaped structure considerably. In particular, if the arms pertinent to the \"old\" structures lie in the sky plane whereas the arms resulting from the\nrenewed activity do not, the observed structure would be a superposition of an \"old\", double-lobed fader-like component and\nan asymmetric i.e. core-jet central component, which might not\nbe perceived as such in low-resolution observations that are\nsufficient for a proper imaging of the double-lobed component.\nIt follows that CDTs could actually be X-shaped sources distorted by beaming and Doppler boosting, and their morphologies are a consequence of a fast repositioning of the central engine. Recently, as a result of investigating ZwCl 0735.7+7421,\nCohen et al. (2005) have suggested that a realignment of a rotating SMBH followed by a repositioning of the accretion disk\nand the jets is a plausible interpretation of misaligned radio\nstructures, even if they are not conspicuously X-shaped.\nWe conclude that it is plausible that three misaligned radio\nstructures shown here in detail could be distorted X-shaped or\nZ-shaped sources probably resulting from merger events. The\n\nexistence of a merger in TXS 1033+026 actually seems to be\nvisible in the SDSS image. It is to be noted that the theory\ngiven by KSR, which precludes the possibility of the existence\nof aligned mini-DDRGs, can be reconciled with observations\nof misaligned restarted sources with outer structure sizes below\n\u2248700 kpc. This is because the misalignments are usually large\nand the shapes of the cocoons highly non-spherical. In such\ncircumstances, even if the parameters of the medium inside the\ncocoon prevent the development of inner lobes so that the secondary jets move \"silently\" across the cocoon's interior, they\nwould shortly reach the side of the cocoon where they would\nbe exposed to the unperturbed and much higher density IGM.\nObservable jets or hotspots could then appear.\n\n5. Conclusions and future work\nA programme to find radio sources with linear sizes below\n1 Mpc and showing signatures of possibly restarted activity was\nundertaken. To this end a computer-aided selection procedure\naimed at finding CDTs in the FIRST catalogue was devised and\na sample of candidates drawn up. These were then observed\nwith MERLIN at 5 GHz to reveal the subarcecond-scale morphology of their central (\"core\") components. In 4 out of 15 targets observed, the \"cores\" appear either as doubles or core-jets,\nwith three of them misaligned with respect to their outer structures. Repositioning of the central engine of an AGN caused\nby a merger event seems to be a plausible scenario leading to\nthe development of the observed morphologies in these three\nsources, as difficulties can arise with application of the helical jet model when attempting to explain large misalignments\n(Cassaro et al., 2002, and references therein). Under such circumstances the concept of restarted activity, coupled with a\nswift repositioning of the central engine of the radio source due\nto a merger event, is a very competitive alternative because of\nits simplicity and plausibility. As this scenario may also work\nvery well for X-shaped sources, they could be regarded as a\nparent population of CDTs; the apparent existence of the latter class is simply the result of orientation effects on X-shaped\nsources. More numerous and complete samples of both classes\nare needed to confirm this on a sound statistical basis but, at\nleast, the scarcity of both X-shaped and CDT objects seems to\nqualitatively agree.\nNo misalignment was detected in the fourth source under investigation, TXS 0818+214, and only a rather modest\n(30\u25e6 ) misalignment was observed in TXS 1312+563. The inner\nparts of these two sources could be interpreted as double-lobed\nstructures, but further multifrequency observations are necessary to provide support for such an interpretation. If confirmed,\nTXS 0818+214 and TXS 1312+563 would be the most compact double-double radio sources known to date. An attempt\nto explain their nature by the theory developed by KSR would\nmake a modification of this theory necessary, given that the linear sizes of these two sources are below the required limit.\nAcknowledgements.\nMERLIN is operated by the University of Manchester as a National\nFacility on behalf of the Particle Physics & Astronomy Research\nCouncil (PPARC).\n\n\fA.
