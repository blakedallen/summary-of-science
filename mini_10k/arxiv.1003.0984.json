Familiar examples include the localized vibrational modes around impurities or defects in crystals and Anderson localization\nof waves in disordered media [1]. The usual perception among solid-state researchers is that, in perfect lattices excitations must be extended objects as well,\nessentially plane wave like. Such firmly entrenched perceptions were severely\njolted since the discovery of discrete breathers (DB), also known as intrinsic\nlocalized modes (ILM). These states are typical excitations in perfectly periodic but strongly nonlinear systems, and are characterized by being spatially\nlocalized, at variance to plane wave states [2, 3, 4].\nDB-like excitations, being generic objects, have been observed in a large\nvariety of lattice systems that include bond excitations in molecules, lattice\nvibrations and spin excitations in solids, charge flow in coupled Josephson junctions, light propagation in interacting optical waveguides, cantilever vibrations\nin michromechanical arrays, cold atom dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates\nloaded on optical lattices, among others. They have been extensively studied,\nand a high level of understanding about their properties has been reached.\nTwo decades of intensive research have polished our theoretical understanding of DBs in classical nonlinear lattices. Less is known about their quantum\ncounterparts - quantum breathers (QB). This chapter is devoted to a review of\nthe more recent studies in this field. The concept of QBs is closely related with\nthe theme of dynamical tunneling in phase space.\n\n1\n\n\f1.1\n\nA few facts about classical discrete breathers\n\nLet us study the combined effect of nonlinearity and discreteness on the spatial\nlocalization of a discrete breather on a basic level. For that we look into the\ndynamics of a one-dimensional chain of interacting (scalar) oscillators with the\nHamiltonian\n\u0015\nX\u00141\n2\nH=\np + V (xn ) + W (xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ) .\n(1)\n2 n\nn\nThe integer n marks the lattice site number of a possibly infinite chain, and xn\nand pn are the canonically conjugated coordinate and momentum of a degree\nof freedom associated with site number n. The on-site potential V and the\ninteraction potential W satisfy V \u2032 (0) = W \u2032 (0) = 0, V \u2032\u2032 (0), W \u2032\u2032 (0) \u2265 0. This\nchoice ensures that the classical ground state xn = pn = 0 is a minimum of the\nenergy H. The equations of motion read\n\u1e8bn = pn , \u1e57n = \u2212V \u2032 (xn ) \u2212 W \u2032 (xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ) + W \u2032 (xn+1 \u2212 xn ) .\n\n(2)\n\nLet us linearize the equations of motion around the classical ground state.\nWe obtain a set of linear coupled differential equations with solutions being\nsmall amplitude plane waves:\n\u0010q \u0011\n.\n(3)\nxn (t) \u223c ei(\u03c9q t\u2212qn) , \u03c9q2 = V \u2032\u2032 (0) + 4W \u2032\u2032 (0) sin2\n2\nThese waves are characterized by a wave number q and a corresponding frequency \u03c9q . All allowed plane wave frequencies fill a part of the real axis which is\ncoined linear spectrum. Due to the underlying lattice the frequency \u03c9q depends\nperiodically on q and its absolute value has always a finitepupper bound. The\nmaximum (Debye) frequency of small amplitude waves \u03c9\u03c0 = V \u2032\u2032 (0) + 4W \u2032\u2032 (0).\nDepending on the choice of the potential V (x), \u03c9q can be either acoustic- or\noptic-like, V (0) = 0 and V (0) 6= 0, respectively. In the first case the linear spectrum covers the interval \u2212\u03c9\u03c0 \u2264 \u03c9q \u2264 \u03c9\u03c0 which includes \u03c9q=0 = 0. In\np the latter\ncase an additional (finite) gap opens for |\u03c9q | below the value \u03c90 = V \u2032\u2032 (0).\nFor large amplitude excitations the linearization of the equations of motion is\nnot correct anymore. Similar to the case of a single anharmonic oscillator, the\nfrequency of possible time-periodic excitations will depend on the amplitude\nof the excitation, and thus may be located outside the linear spectrum. Let\nus assume that a time-periodic and spatially localized state, i.e. a discrete\nbreather, x\u0302n (t + Tb ) = x\u0302n (t) exists as an exact solution of Eqs.(2) with the\nperiod Tb = 2\u03c0/\u03a9b . Due to its time periodicity, we can expand x\u0302n (t) into a\nFourier series\nX\nx\u0302n (t) =\nAkn eik\u03a9b t .\n(4)\nk\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are by assumption also localized in space\nAk,|n|\u2192\u221e \u2192 0 .\n\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\fInserting this ansatz into the equations of motion (2) and linearizing the resulting algebraic equations for Fourier coefficients in the spatial breather tails\n(where the amplitudes are by assumption small) we arrive at the following linear\nalgebraic equations:\nk 2 \u03a92b Akn = V \u2032\u2032 (0)Akn + W \u2032\u2032 (0)(2Akn \u2212 Ak,n\u22121 \u2212 Ak,n+1 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nIf k\u03a9b = \u03c9q , the solution to (6) is Ak,n = c1 eiqn + c2 e\u2212iqn . Any nonzero\n(whatever small) amplitude Ak,n wil thus oscillate without further spatial decay,\ncontradicting the initial assumption. If however\nk\u03a9b 6= \u03c9q\n\n(7)\n\nfor any integer k and any q, then the general solution to (6) is given by Ak,n =\nc1 \u03ban + c2 \u03ba\u2212n where \u03ba is a real number depending on \u03c9q , \u03a9b and k. It always\nadmits an (actually exponential) spatial decay by choosing either c1 or c2 to be\nnonzero. In order to fulfill (7) for at least one real value of \u03a9b and any integer k,\nwe have to request |\u03c9q | to be bounded from above. That is precisely the reason\nwhy the spatial lattice is needed. In contrast most spatially continuous field\nequations will have linear spectra which are unbounded. That makes resonances\nof higher order harmonics of a localized excitation with the linear spectrum\nunavoidable. The nonresonance condition (7) is thus an (almost) necessary\ncondition for obtaining a time-periodic localized state on a Hamiltonian lattice\n[2].\nThe performed analysis can be extended to more general classes of discrete\nlattices, including e.g. long-range interactions between sites, more degrees of\nfreedom per each site, higher-dimensional lattices etc. But the resulting nonresonance condition (7) keeps its generality, illustrating the key role of discreteness and nonlinearity for the existence of discrete breathers.\nLet us show discrete breather solutions for various lattices. We start with a\nchain (1) with the functions\n1\nV (x) = x2 + x3 + x4 , W (x) = 0.1x2 .\n4\n\n(8)\n\nThe spectrum \u03c9q is optic-like and shown in Fig.1. Discrete breather solutions\ncan have frequencies \u03a9b which are located both below and above the linear spectrum. The time-reversal symmetry of (2) allows to search for DB displacements\nxn (t = 0) when all velocities \u1e8bn (t = 0) = 0. These initial displacements are\ncomputed with high accuracy (see following sections) and plotted in the insets in\nFig.1 [3]. We show solutions to two DB frequencies located above and below \u03c9q\n- their actual values are marked with the green arrows. To each DB frequency\nwe show two different spatial DB patterns - among an infinite number of other\npossibilities, as we will see below. The high-frequency DBs (\u03a9b \u2248 1.66) occur\nfor large-amplitude, high-energy motion with adjacent particles moving out of\nphase. Low-frequency DBs (\u03a9b \u2248 1.26) occur for small-amplitude motion with\nadjacent particles moving in phase.\n3\n\n\f1.8\n1\n0.\n-1\n\n1.6\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c9q\n1.4\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n1.2\n\n0.\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nq\n\nFigure 1: The frequency versus wavenumber dependence of the linear spectrum\nfor a one-dimensional chain of anharmonic oscillators with potentials (8).

Red circles indicate the oscillator displacements for a given DB\nsolution, with all velocities equal to zero. Lines connecting circles are guides for\nthe eye. From [3].\nIn Fig.2 we show two DB solutions for a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain of particles\ncoupled via anharmonic springs V (x) = 0, W (x) = 12 x2 + 41 x4 (c.f. (1)) which\nhas an acoustic-type spectrum [5]. The DB frequency is in both cases \u03a9b = 4.5.\nAgain the displacements xn are shown for an initial time when all velocities\nvanish. In the inset we plot the strain un = xn \u2212 xn\u22121 on a log-normal scale.\nThe DB solutions are exponentially localized in space.\nFinally we show DB solutions for a two-dimensional square lattice of anharmonic oscillators with nearest neighbour coupling. The equations of motion\nread\n\u1e8di,j = k(xi+1,j + xi\u22121,j \u2212 2xi,j ) + k(xi,j+1 + xi,j\u22121 \u2212 2xi,j ) \u2212 xi,j \u2212 x3i,j\n\n(9)\n\nwith oscillator potentials V (x) = 21 x2 + 14 x4 . In Fig.3 we plot the oscillator\ndisplacements with all velocities equal to zero for three different DB frequencies\nand k = 0.05 [6]. For all cases adjacent oscillators move out of phase.\nWe conclude this section with emphasizing that DB solutions can be typically\nlocalized on a few lattice sites, regardless of the lattice dimension. Thus little\noverall coherence is needed to excite a state nearby - just a few sites have to\noscillate coherently, the rest of the lattice does not participate strongly in the\nexcitation.\n\n4\n\n\f3\n\nU n (t=0)\n\n1e+02\n\nx n (t=0)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1e-02\n1e-06\n1e-10\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\nn\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n1e+02\n\nU n (t=0)\n\n2\n1.5\n\nx n (t=0)\n\n4\n\nn\n\n1e-02\n1e-06\n1e-10\n\n1\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nn\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nn\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFigure 2: Discrete breather solutions for a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain (see text).\nThese states are frequently referred to as the Page mode (left) and the SieversTakeno mode (right).

The many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nis linear and translationally invariant, therefore all eigenstates must obey the\nBloch theorem. Thus we cannot expect eigenstates of the Hamiltonian to be\nspatially localized (on the lattice). What is the correspondence between the\nquantum eigenvalue problem and the classical dynamical evolution?\nThe concept of tunneling is a possible answer to this puzzle. Naively speak-\n\n5\n\n\fing we quantize the family of periodic orbits associated with a discrete breather\nlocated somewhere on the lattice. Notice that there are as many such families as there are lattice sites. The quantization (e.g., Bohr-Sommerfeld) yields\nsome eigenvalues. Since we can perform the same procedure with any family\nof discrete breather periodic orbits which differ only in their location on the\nlattice, we obtain N -fold degeneracy for every thus obtained eigenvalue, where\nN stands for the number of lattice sites. Unless we consider the trivial case\nof uncoupled lattice sites, these degeneracies will be lifted. Consequently, we\nwill instead obtain bands of states with finite band width. These bands will be\ncalled quantum breather bands. The inverse tunneling time of a semiclassical\nbreather from one site to a neighboring one is a measure of the bandwidth.\nWe can then formulate the following expectation: if a classical nonlinear\nHamiltonian lattice possesses discrete breathers, its quantum counterpart should\nshow up with nearly degenerate bands of eigenstates, if the classical limit is considered. The number of states in such a band is N , and the eigenfunctions are\ngiven by Bloch-like superpositions of the semiclassical eigenfunctions obtained\nusing the mentioned Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of the classical periodic orbits. By nearly degenerate we mean that the bandwidth of a quantum breather\nband is much smaller than the spacing between different breather bands and the\naverage level spacing in the given energy domain, and the classical limit implies\nlarge eigenvalues.\nAnother property of a quantum breather state is that such a state shows\nup with exponential localization in appropriate correlation functions [10]. This\napproach selects all many-particle bound states, no matter how deep one is in\nthe quantum regime. In this sense quantum breather states belong to the class\nof many-particle bound states.\nFor large energies and N the density of states becomes large too. What will\nhappen to the expected quantum breather bands then? Will the hybridization\nwith other non-breather states destroy the particle-like nature of the quantum\nbreather, or not? What is the impact of the nonintegrability of most systems\nallowing for classical breather solutions? Since the quantum case corresponds\nto a quantization of the classical phase space, we could expect that chaotic trajectories lying nearby classical breather solutions might affect the corresponding\nquantum eigenstates.\nFrom a computational point of view we are very much restricted in our\nabilities to study quantum breathers. Ideally we would like to study quantum\nproperties of a lattice problem in the high energy domain (to make contact with\nclassical states) and for large lattices. This is typically impossible, since solving\nthe quantum problem amounts to diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix with\nrank bN where b is the number of states per site, which should be large to make\ncontact with classical dynamics. Thus typically quantum breather states have\nbeen so far obtained numerically for small one-dimensional systems [10, 11, 12].\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Spectrum of the quantum DNLS with b = 2 and N = 101.

This Hamiltonian conserves the\ntotal number of particles\nX\nB=\nnl , nl = a\u2020l al .\n(12)\nl\n\nFor b particles and N sites the number of basis states is\n(b + N \u2212 1)!\n.\nb!(N \u2212 1)!\n\n(13)\n\nFor b = 0 there is just one trivial state of an empty lattice. For b = 1 there are\nN states which correspond to one-boson excitations. These states are similar to\nclassical extended wave states. For b = 2 the problem is still exactly solvable,\nbecause it corresponds to a two-body problem on a lattice. A corresponding\nnumerical solution is sketched in Fig. 4. Note the wide two-particle continuum,\nand a single band located below. This single band corresponds to quasiparticle\n7\n\n\fstates characterized by one single quantum number (related to the wavenumber\nq). These states are two-particle bound states. The dispersion of this band is\ngiven [13] by\nr\n\u0010q \u0011\n.\n(14)\nE = \u2212 1 + 16C 2 cos2\n2\nAny eigenstate from this two-particle bound state band is characterized by exponential localization of correlations, i.e. when represented in some set of basis\nstates, the amplitude or overlap with a basis state where the two particles are\nseparated by some number of sites is exponentially decreasing with increasing\nseparation distance. Note that a compact bound state is obtained for q = \u00b1\u03c0,\ni.e. for these wave numbers basis states with nonzero separation distance do\nnot contribute to the eigenstate at all [14].\n\n2.2\n\nThe dimer\n\nA series of papers was devoted to the properties of the quantum dimer [15, 16,\n17, 18]. This system describes the dynamics of bosons fluctuating between two\nsites. The number of bosons is conserved, and together with the conservation\nof energy the system appears to be integrable. Of course, one cannot consider\nspatial localization in such a model. However, a reduced form of the discrete\ntranslational symmetry - namely the permutational symmetry of the two sites can be imposed. Together with the addition of nonlinear terms in the classical\nequations of motion the dimer allows for classical trajectories which are not\ninvariant under permutation. The phase space can be completely analyzed, all\nisolated periodic orbits (IPO) can be found. There appears exactly one bifurcation on one family of isolated periodic orbits, which leads to the appearance of\na separatrix in phase space. The separatrix separates three regions - one invariant and two non-invariant under permutations. The subsequent analysis of the\nquantum dimer demonstrated the existence of pairs of eigenstates with nearly\nequal eigenenergies [15]. The separatrix and the bifurcation in the classical\nphase space can be traced in the spectrum of the quantum dimer [17].\nThe classical Hamiltonian may be written as\nH = \u03a8\u22171 \u03a81 + \u03a8\u22172 \u03a82 +\n\n\u0001\n1\n(\u03a8\u22171 \u03a81 )2 + (\u03a8\u22172 \u03a82 )2 + C (\u03a8\u22171 \u03a82 + \u03a8\u22172 \u03a81 ) .\n2\n\n(15)\n\nwith the equations of motion \u03a8\u03071,2 = i\u2202H/\u2202\u03a8\u22171,2 . The model conserves the norm\n(or number of particles) B = |\u03a81 |2 + |\u03a82 |2 .\nLet us parameterize the phase space of (15) with \u03a81,2 = A1,2 ei\u03c61,2 , A1,2 \u2265 0.\nIt follows that A1,2 is time independent and \u03c61 = \u03c62 + \u2206 with \u2206 = 0, \u03c0 and\n\u03c6\u03071,2 = \u03c9 being also time independent. Solving the algebraic equations for the\n\n8\n\n\famplitudes of the IPOs we obtain\n1\n1\nB , \u2206=0, \u03c9 =1+C+ B ,\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\nII : A1,2 = B , \u2206 = \u03c0 , \u03c9 = 1 \u2212 C + B ,\n2\n2\n\u0011\np\n1 \u0010\n2\n2\n2\nIII : A1 = B 1 \u00b1 1 \u2212 4C /B\n, \u2206=0, \u03c9 =1+B .\n2\nI : A21,2 =\n\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n\nIPO III corresponds to two elliptic solutions which break the permutational\nsymmetry. IPO III exists for B \u2265 Bb with Bb = 2C and occurs through\na bifurcation from IPO I. The corresponding separatrix manifold is uniquely\ndefined by the energy of IPO I at a given value of B \u2265 Bb . This manifold\nseparates three regions in phase space - two with symmetry broken solutions,\neach one containing one of the IPOs III, and one with symmetry conserving\nsolutions containing the elliptic IPO II. The separatrix manifold itself contains\nthe hyperbolic IPO I. For B \u2264 Bb only two IPOs exist - IPO I and II, with both\nof them being of elliptic character. Remarkably there exist no other IPOs, and\nthe mentioned bifurcation and separatrix manifolds are the only ones present in\nthe classical phase space of (15).\nTo conclude the analysis of the classical part, we list the energy properties\nof the different phase space parts separated by the separatrix manifold. First\nit is straightforward to show that the IPOs (16)-(18) correspond to maxima,\nminima or saddle points of the energy in the allowed energy interval for a given\nvalue of B, with no other extrema or saddle points present. It follows\n1\nE1 = H(IPO I) = B + B 2 + CB ,\n4\n1\nE2 = H(IPO II) = B + B 2 \u2212 CB ,\n4\n1\nE3 = H(IPO III) = B + B 2 + C 2 .\n2\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nFor B < Bb we have E1 > E2 (IPO I - maximum, IPO II - minimum). For\nB \u2265 Bb it follows E3 > E1 > E2 (IPO III - maxima, IPO I - saddle, IPO\nII - minimum). If B < Bb , then all trajectories are symmetry conserving. If\nB \u2265 Bb , then trajectories with energies E1 < E \u2264 E3 are symmetry breaking,\nand trajectories with E2 \u2264 E \u2264 E1 are symmetry conserving.\nThe quantum eigenvalue problem amounts to replacing the complex functions \u03a8, \u03a8\u2217 in (15) by the boson annihilation and creation operators a, a\u2020 with\nthe standard commutation relations (to enforce the invariance under the exchange \u03a8 \u21d4 \u03a8\u2217 the substitution has to be done on rewriting \u03a8\u03a8\u2217 = 1/2(\u03a8\u03a8\u2217 +\n\u03a8\u2217 \u03a8)):\n\u0011\n\u0011 1\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n5 3\u0010 \u2020\nH= +\na1 a1 + a\u20202 a2 +\n(a\u20201 a1 )2 + (a\u20202 a2 )2 + C a\u20201 a2 + a\u20202 a1 .

Each value of b corresponds to a subspace of the dimension\n(b + 1) in the space of eigenfunctions of B. These eigenfunctions are products\nof the number states |ni of each degree of freedom and can be characterized by\na symbol |n, mi with n bosographicsns in the site 1 and m bosons in the site 2.\nFor a given value of b it follows m = b \u2212 n. So we can actually label each state\nby just one number n: |n, (b \u2212 n)i \u2261 |n).

Notice that the matrix Hnm is a symmetric band\nmatrix. The additional symmetry Hnm = H(b\u2212n),(b\u2212m) is a consequence of the\npermutational symmetry of H. For C = 0 the matrix Hnm is diagonal, with\nthe property that each eigenvalue is doubly degenerate (except for the state\n|b/2) for even values of b). The classical phase space contains only symmetry\nbroken trajectories, with the exception of IPO II and the separatrix with IPO\nI (in fact in this limit the separatrix manifold is nothing but a resonant torus\ncontaining both IPOs I and II). With the exception of the separatrix manifold,\nall tori break permutational symmetry and come in two groups separated by the\nseparatrix. Then quantizing each group will lead to pairs of degenerate eigenvalues - one from each group. There is a clear correspondence to the spectrum\nof the diagonal (C = 0) matrix Hnm . The eigenvalues H00 = Hbb correspond to\nthe quantized IPOs III. With increasing n the eigenvalues Hnn = H(b\u2212n),(b\u2212n)\ncorrespond to quantized tori further away from the IPO III. Finally the states\nwith n = b/2 for even b or n = (b \u2212 1)/2 for odd b are tori most close to the separatrix. Switching the side diagonals on by increasing C will lead to a splitting\nof all pairs of eigenvalues.

Adapted from [17].\nno correspondence to classical system properties. However, in the limit of large\nb we enter the semiclassical regime, and due to the integrability of the system,\neigenfunctions should correspond to tori in the classical phase space which satisfy the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization rules. Increasing C from zero will\nlead to a splitting \u2206En of the eigenvalue doublets of C = 0. In other words, we\nfind pairs of eigenvalues, which are related to each other through the symmetry\nof their eigenvectors and (for small enough C) through the small value of the\nsplitting. These splittings have been calculated numerically and using perturbation theory [15, 17]. In the limit of large b the splittings are exponentially small\nfor energies above the classical separatrix energy (i.e. for classical trajectories\nwhich are not invariant under permutation). If the eigenenergies are lowered\nbelow the classical separatrix energy, the splittings grow rapidly up to the mean\nlevel spacing.\nIn Fig. 5 the results of a diagonalization of a system with 600 particles\n(b = 600) is shown [17]. The inset shows the density of states versus energy,\nwhich nicely confirms the predicted singularity at the energy of the separatrix\nof the classical counterpart. In order to compute the exponentially small splittings, we may use e.g. a Mathematica routine which allows to choose arbitrary\nvalues for the precision of computations. Here we chose precision 512. In Fig. 6\nthe numerically computed splittings are compared to perturbation theory results. As expected, the splittings become extremely small above the separatrix.\nConsequently these states will follow for long times the dynamics of a classical\nbroken symmetry state.\n\n2.3\n\nThe trimer\n\nThe integrability of the dimer does not allow a study of the influence of chaos\n(i.e. nonintegrability) on the tunneling properties of the mentioned pairs of\neigenstates. A natural extension of the dimer to a trimer adds a third degree of\n11\n\n\ffreedom without adding a new integral of motion. Consequently the trimer is\nnonintegrable. A still comparatively simple numerical quantization of the trimer\nallows to study the behavior of many tunneling states in the large-energy domain\nof the eigenvalue spectrum [19].\nSimilarly to the dimer, the quantum trimer Hamiltonian is represented in\nthe form\ni\n15 3 \u2020\n1h \u2020 2\nH=\n(a1 a1 ) + (a\u20202 a2 )2\n+ (a1 a1 + a\u20202 a2 + a\u20203 a3 ) +\n8\n2\n2\n+C(a\u20201 a2 + a\u20202 a1 ) + \u03b4(a\u20201 a3 + a\u20203 a1 + a\u20202 a3 + a\u20203 a2 ) .\n(24)\nAgain B = a\u20201 a1 + a\u20202 a2 + a\u20203 a3 commutes with the Hamiltonian, thus we can\ndiagonalize (24) in the basis of eigenfunctions of B. For any finite eigenvalue b\nof B the number of states is finite, namely (b + 1)(b + 2)/2. Thus the infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space separates into an infinite set of finite dimensional\nsubspaces, each subspace containing only vectors with a given eigenvalue b.\nThese eigenfunctions are products of the number states |ni of each degree of\nfreedom and can be characterized by a symbol |n, m, li where we have n bosons\non site 1, m bosons on site 2, and l bosons on site 3. For a given value b it follows\nthat l = b \u2212 m \u2212 n. So we can actually label each state by just two numbers\n(n, m): |n, m, (b \u2212 n \u2212 m)i \u2261 |n, m). Note that the third site added to the dimer\nis different from the first two sites. There is no boson-boson interaction on this\nsite. Thus site 3 serves simply as a boson reservoir for the dimer. Dimer bosons\nmay now fluctuate from the dimer to the reservoir. The trimer has the same\npermutational symmetry as the dimer.\nThe matrix elements of (24) between states from different b subspaces vanish. Thus for any given b the task amounts to diagonalizing a finite dimensional\nmatrix. The matrix has a tridiagonal block structure, with each diagonal block\nbeing a dimer matrix (23). The nonzero off-diagonal blocks contain interaction\nterms proportional to \u03b4. We consider symmetric |\u03a8is and antisymmetric |\u03a8ia\nstates. The structure of the corresponding symmetric and antisymmetric decompositions of H is similar to H itself. In the following we will present results\nfor b = 40. We will also drop the first two terms of the RHS in (24), because\nthese only lead to a shift of the energy spectrum. Since we evaluate the matrix\nelements explicitly, we need only a few seconds to obtain all eigenvalues and\neigenvectors with the help of standard Fortran routines. In Fig. 7 we plot a\npart of the energy spectrum as a function of \u03b4 for C = 2 [19]. As discussed\nabove, the Hamiltonian decomposes into noninteracting blocks for \u03b4 = 0, each\nblock corresponding to a dimer with a boson number between 0 and b. For \u03b4 6= 0\nthe block-block interaction leads to typical features in the spectrum, like, e.g.,\navoided crossings. The full quantum energy spectrum extends roughly over 103 ,\nleading to an averaged spacing of order 100 . Also the upper third of the spectrum is diluted compared to the lower two thirds. The correspondence to the\nclassical model is obtained with the use of the transformation Ecl = Eqm /b2 + 1\nand for parameters C/b and \u03b4/b (the classical value for B is B = 1).\nThe main result of this computation so far is that tunneling pairs of eigenstates of the dimer persist in the nonintegrable regime \u03b4 6= 0.

In Fig.8 we plot the pair splitting of the\npair which has energy \u2248 342 at \u03b4 = 0 [20]. Denote with x, y, z the eigenvalues\nof the site number operators n1 , n2 , n3 . We may consider the quantum states\nof the trimer at \u03b4 = 0 when z is a good quantum number and then follow the\nevolution of these states with increasing \u03b4. The state for \u03b4 = 0 can be traced\nback to C = 0 and be thus characterized in addition by x and y. The chosen\npair states are then characterized by x = 26(0), y = 0(26) and z = 14 for\nC = \u03b4 = 0. Note that this pair survives approximately 30 avoided crossings\nbefore it is finally destroyed at coupling strength \u03b4 \u2248 2.67 as seen in Fig. 7.\n13\n\n\fFigure 9: Contour plot of the logarithm of the symmetric eigenstate of\nthe chosen tunneling pair (cf. Fig. 7) for five different values of \u03b4 =\n0, 0.3, 0.636, 1.0, 1.8 (their location is indicated by filled circles in Fig. 8). (a):\nthree equidistant grid lines are used; (b-e): ten grid lines are used. Minimum\nvalue of squared wave function is 10\u221230 , maximum value is about 1. Adapted\nfrom [20].\nFrom Fig. 8 we find that the splitting rapidly increases gaining about eight\norders of magnitude when \u03b4 changes from 0 to slightly above 0.5. Then this\nrapid but nevertheless smooth rise is interrupted by very sharp spikes when\nthe splitting \u2206E rises by several orders of magnitude with \u03b4 changing by mere\npercents and then abruptly changes in the opposite direction sometimes even\novershooting its pre-spike value. Such spikes, some larger, some smaller, repeat\nwith increasing \u03b4 until the splitting value approaches the mean level spacing of\norder one. Only then one may say that the pair is destroyed since it can be\nhardly distinguished among the other trimer levels.\nAnother observation is presented in Fig. 9 [20]. We plot the intensity distribution of the logarithm of the squared symmetric wave function of our chosen\npair for five different values of \u03b4 = 0 , 0.3 , 0.636 , 1.0 , 1.8 (their locations are\nindicated by filled circles in Fig. 8). We use the eigenstates of B as basis states.\nThey can be represented as |x, y, z > where x, y, z are the particle numbers on\nsites 1, 2, 3, respectively. Due to the commutation of B with H two site occupation numbers are enough if the total particle number is fixed. Thus the final\nencoding of states (for a given value of b) can be chosen as |x, z). The abscissa\nin Fig. 9 is x and the ordinate is z. Thus the intensity plots provide us with\ninformation about the order of particle flow in the course the tunneling process.\nFor \u03b4 = 0 (Fig. 9(a)) the only possibility for the 26 particles on site 1 is to directly tunnel to site 2. Site 3 is decoupled with its 14 particles not participating\nin the process. The squared wave function takes the form of a compact rim\n\n14\n\n\f2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n===>\n\n===>\n\n(b)\n\n==\n\n=>\n\n=>\n==\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\nFigure 10: Order of tunneling in the trimer.

Nonzero values of the wave\nfunction are observed only on the rim. This direct tunneling has been described\nin chapter 2.2. When switching on some nonzero coupling to the third site, the\nparticle number on the dimer (sites 1,2) is not conserved anymore. The third\nsite serves as a particle reservoir which is able either to collect particles from\nor supply particles to the dimer. This coupling will allow for nonzero values of\nthe wave function away from the rim. But most importantly, it will change the\nshape of the rim. We observe that the rim is bended down to smaller z values\nwith increasing \u03b4. That implies that the order of tunneling (when, e.g., going\nfrom large to small x values) is as follows: first, some particles tunnel from site\n1 to site 2 and simultaneously from site 3 to site 2 (Fig. 10(a)). Afterwards particles flow from site 1 to both sites 2 and 3 (Fig. 10(b)). With increasing \u03b4 the\nstructure of the wave function intensity becomes more and more complex, possibly revealing information about the classical phase space flow structure. Thus\nwe observe three intriguing features. First, the tunneling splitting increases by\neight orders of magnitude when \u03b4 increases from zero to 0.5. This seems to be\nunexpected, since at those values perturbation theory in \u03b4 should be applicable\n(at least Fig. 7 indicates that this should be true for the levels themselves). The\nsemiclassical explanation of this result was obtained in [20].\nThe second observation is that the tunneling begins with a flow of particles\nfrom the bath (site 3) directly to the empty site which is to be filled (with simultaneous flow from the filled dimer site to the empty one). At the end of the\ntunneling process the initially filled dimer site is giving particles back to the\nbath site. Again this is an unexpected result, since it implies that the particle\nnumber on the dimer is increasing during the tunneling, which seems to decrease\nthe tunneling probability, according to the results for an isolated dimer. These\nfirst two results are closely connected (see [20] for a detailed explanation).\nThe third result concerns the resonant structure on top of the smooth variation\nin Fig. 8. The resonant enhancements and suppressions of tunneling are related\nto avoided crossings. Their presence implies that a fine tuning of the system\nparameters may strongly suppress or enhance tunneling which may be useful\nfor spectroscopic devices. In Fig. 11 we show the four various possibilities of\navoided crossings between a pair and a single level and between two pairs, and\n15\n\n\f6e\u221205\n\n6e\u221205\n\n(a)\n\n\u2206E\n\n4e\u221205\n\n\u03b4\n\nenergy levels\n\n(b)\n\nenergy levels\n\n\u2206E\n\n4e\u221205\n\n\u03b4\n\n2e\u221205\n\n2e\u221205\n\n0e+00\n0.049\n\n0.05\n\n0e+00\n0.049\n\n0.051\n\n\u03b4\n\n0.05\n\n0.051\n\n\u03b4\n\n6e\u221205\n\n(d)\n(c)\n\n\u2206E\n\nenergy levels\n\n\u2206E\n\n4e\u221205\n\n0.01\n\nenergy levels\n\n\u03b4\n\n2e\u221205\n\n\u03b4\n\n0e+00\n0.049\n\n0.05\n\n\u03b4\n\n0.051\n\n0.00\n0.01\n\n0.03\n\n0.05\n\n\u03b4\n\n0.07\n\n0.09\n\nFigure 11: Level splitting variation at avoided crossings.

If the interaction to further more distant states in the spectrum is added, the tunneling splitting can\nbecome exactly zero [21] for some specific value of the control parameter. In\nsuch a rare situation the tunneling is suppressed for all times.\n\n2.4\n\nQuantum roto-breathers\n\nWhen discussing classical breather solutions we have been touching some aspects\nof roto-breathers, including their property of being not invariant under time\nreversal symmetry. In a recent study Dorignac et al have performed [22] an\nanalysis of the corresponding quantum roto-breather properties in a dimer with\nthe Hamiltonian\n\u001b\n2 \u001a 2\nX\npi\nH=\n+ \u03b1(1 \u2212 cos xi ) + \u03b5(1 \u2212 cos(x1 \u2212 x2 )) .\n(25)\n2\ni=1\nThe classical roto-breather solution consists of one pendulum rotating and the\nother oscillating with a given period Tb . Since the model has two symmetries - permutation of the indices and time-reversal symmetry - which may be\nboth broken by classical trajectories, the irreducible representations of quantum\neigenstates contain four symmetry sectors (with possible combinations of symmetric or antisymmetric states with respect to the two symmetry operations).\nConsequently, a quantum roto-breather state is belonging to a quadruplet of\nweakly split states rather than to a pair as discussed above. The schematic\nrepresentation of the appearance of such a quadruplet is shown in Fig. 12 [22].\nThe obtained quadruplet has an additional fine structure as compared to the\ntunneling pair of the above considered dimer and trimer.

Two of them are\nenergy or momentum transfer from one pendulum to the other one, while the\nthird one corresponds to total momentum reversal (which restores time reversal\nsymmetry). The dependence of the corresponding tunneling rates on the coupling \u03b5 is shown for a specific quadruplet from [22] in Fig. 13. For very weak\ncoupling \u03b5 \u226a 1 the fastest tunneling process will be momentum reversal, since\ntunneling between the pendula is blocked. However as soon as the coupling is\nincreased, the momentum reversal turns into the slowest process, with breather\ntunneling from one pendulum to the other one being orders of magnitude faster.\n17\n\n\fNote that again resonant features on these splitting curves are observed, which\nare related to avoided crossings.\n\n2.5\n\nLarge lattices with fluctuating numbers of quanta\n\nA number of publications are devoted to the properties of quantum breathers\nin chains and two-dimensional lattices of coupled anharmonic oscillators. For\nthe respective one-dimensional case, the Hamiltonian is given by\n\u0015\nX\u00141\n2\np + V (xn ) + W (xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ) .\n(26)\nH=\n2 n\nn\nHere V (x) = 12 x2 + 41 v4 x4 (or similar) and the nearest neighbour coupling\nW (x) = 12 Cx2 . The classical version of such models conserves only the energy,\nbut not any equivalent of a norm. Therefore, no matter whether one uses\ncreation and annihilation operators of the harmonic oscillator [23], or similar\noperators which diagonalize the single anharmonic oscillator problem [24], the\nresulting Hamiltonian matrix will not commute with the corresponding number\noperator. Calculations will typically be restricted to 4-6 quanta, and lattice\nsizes of the order of 30 for d = 1, 13 \u00d7 13 for d = 2 [23]. With these parameters\none can calculate properties of quantum breather states, which correspond to\ntypically two quanta which are bound (with unavoidable states with different\nnumber of quanta, contributing as well). For large enough v4 a complete gap\nopens between the two-quanta continuum and quantum breather states [10, 23]\n(Figs.14 and 15). When decreasing the anharmonic constant v4 , Proville found,\nthat the gap closes for certain wave numbers, but persists for others, becoming\na pseudogap [25, 23] (Fig.14).\nInvolved calculations of the dynamical structure factor (e.g. available by\nneutron scattering in crystals) have shown, that signatures of quantum breathers\nare imprinted in these integral characteristics of the underlying lattice dynamics\n[10, 24], yet the working out of these differences may become a subtle task (see\nFig.16 for an example).\nFinally, Fleurov et al [26] estimated the influence of the tunnel splitting of\na dimer, when embedded in an infinite chain. This situation is close to the\ntunneling of a very localized DB, so that the nonlinearity (interaction between\nbosons) can be taken into account only on the two sites, which participate in\nthe tunneling, while the nonlinearity can be neglected on all other sites. Using\npath integral techniques, the computed tunneling splitting has been shown to\nbecome smaller as compared to the case of an isolated dimer. This is due to\nthe fact, that a DB in an infinite chain has a core and a localized tail. That tail\nhas to be carried through the tunneling process as well, and in analogy with a\nsingle particle tunneling in a double well, the tail increases the effective mass of\nsuch a particle. Consequently the exponential tail of a DB in an infinite chain\ntends to decrease its ability to perform quantum tunneling motion, yet it never\nleads to a full suppression of tunneling [26].\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 14: Eigenspectrum of a chain with 33 sites for parameters (a) C = 0.05,\nv4 = 0.2, and (b) C = 0.05, v4 = 0.02.

Adapted from [23].\n\n3\n3.1\n\nQuantum breather properties\nEvolution of quantum localized states\n\nSuppose that we initially excite only one site in the trimer from above. If this\ninitial state has strong enough overlap with tunneling pair eigenstates, its evolution in time should show distinct properties as compared to the case when the\noverlap is vanishing, or when there are simply no tunneling pair states available.\nSeveral results have been reported. First, a quantum echo was observed in [19]\nby calculating the survival probability of the initial state as a function of time.\nThat quantity measures the probability to find the system in the initial state\nat later times. If the initial state has strong overlap with many eigenstates, it\nis expected to quickly decohere into these different states. Yet, if a substantial overlap with quantum breathers takes place, the survival probability first\nrapidly decays to zero, but echoes up after regular time intervals (Fig.17, left\nplot). If one simply measures the dependence of the number of quanta, then a\nsimilar situation will show up with a very slow beating of the occupation numbers in time, if the overlap of the initial state and a tunneling pair is strong\n19\n\n\fFigure 15: Eigenspectrum of a lattice with 13 \u00d7 13 sites for parameters (top)\nC = 0.025, v4 = 0.1, and (bottom) C = 0.025, v4 = 0.025.

Adapted from [21].\nOn time scales much shorter, we may describe the excitation as a classical\ndiscrete breather state plus a small perturbation. Treating that perturbation\nquantum mechanically, one could expect that the time-periodic DB acts as a\nconstant source of quantum radiation for the quantized phonon field. It turns\nout to be impossible, for very much the same reasons as in the purely classical\ntreatment (see [30]). This result implies, that there is almost no other source of\ndecay for a localized initial state in a quantum lattice, but to slowly tunnel as a\nwhole along the lattice, if nonlinearities allow for the formation of exact classical\nDB states [31]. Numerical calculations for such a case, but with few quanta, were\nperformed by Proville [32], and, similar to the above trimer discussion, showed\nthat if quantum breather states exist in the system, then localized excitations\nstay localized for times which are much longer than the typical phonon diffusion\ntimes in the absence of anharmonicity.\n\n21\n\n\f10\n\n\u2206E\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n-3\n\n-6\n-9\n\nf\u03bc(1,2)/f\u03bc(1,1)\n\n10\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n(b)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\nENERGY\n\nFigure 18: (a) Energy splitting and (b) correlation function vs. energy of the\neigenstates of the dimer (open circles, symmetric eigenstates; solid circles, antisymmetric eigenstates).

Here b = 40 and C = 2.\n\n3.2\n\nSplitting and correlations\n\nQBs are nearly degenerate eigenstates. For the dimer and the trimer, they come\nin symmetric-antisymmetric pairs. So one may compute the nearest neighbor\nenergy spacing (tunneling splitting) between pairs of symmetric-antisymmetric\neigenstates in order to identify QBs. Since QBs correspond to classical orbits\nthat are characterized by energy localization, they may be identified by defining correlation functions. For large lattices it has been shown that QBs have\nexponentially localized correlation functions, in full analogy to their classical\ncounterparts.\nFor the dimer and the trimer, the correlation functions may be defined as\nfollows:\nf\u03bc (1, 2) = hn\u03021 n\u03022 i\u03bc ,\nf\u03bc (1, 1) = hn\u030221 i\u03bc ,\n(27)\n\nwhere n\u0302i = \u00e2\u2020i \u00e2i , and h\u00c2i\u03bc = h\u03c7\u03bc |\u00c2|\u03c7\u03bc i, {|\u03c7\u03bc i} being the set of eigenstates of\nthe system. The ratio 0 \u2264 f\u03bc (1, 2)/f\u03bc (1, 1) \u2264 1 measures the site correlation of\nquanta: it is small when quanta are site-correlated (i.e. when many quanta are\nlocated on one site there are almost none on the other one) and close to unity\notherwise.\nFor the dimer case, the relation b = n1 + n2 , leads to\nf\u03bc (1, 2) = bhn\u03021 i\u03bc \u2212 hn\u030221 i\u03bc .\n\n(28)\n\nIn Fig. 18-left we show the energy splitting and the correlation function of the\neigenstates. We see that beyond a threshold (dashed line), the splitting drops\n22\n\n\fexponentially fast with energy. The corresponding pairs of eigenstates, which\nare tunneling pairs, are site correlated. Thus they are QBs. Their correlation\nfunctions show a fast decrease for energies above the threshold. In these states\nmany quanta are localized on one site of the dimer and the tunneling time\nof such an excitation from one site to the other (given by the inverse energy\nsplitting between the eigenstates of the pair) is exponentially large. As shown\nin Ref. [17], this energy threshold is close to the threshold for the existence of\nDBs in the corresponding classical model.\nQBs are close to symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (A) eigenstates of the\nC = 0 case given by\n1\n|n1 , n2 iS,A = \u221a (|n1 , n2 i \u00b1 |n2 , n1 i),\n2\n\n(29)\n\nwith n1,2 \u226b n2,1 . So we may estimate the dependence of the correlation functions on n1 using the eigenstates (29) and b = n1 + n2 . The result is:\nf (1, 2)n1\n2n1 (b \u2212 n1 )\n,\n= 2\nf (1, 1)n1\nn1 + (b \u2212 n1 )2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere we note that it is equal to unity when n1 = b/2, and vanishes when\nn1 = 0, b.\nUsing the relation between the eigenenergy \u03b5 of the C = 0 case and the\nnumber n1 (= 1, 2, . . . , b)\n\u03b5n1 =\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n5 3\nn1 + (b \u2212 n1 )2 ,\n+ b+\n4 2\n2\n\n(31)\n\none may obtain the energy dependence of the correlation function (30), which\nis plotted in Fig. 18-b (thin solid line). We can see that beyond the energy\nthreshold for appearance of QBs, the numerical results are close to the estimation (30).\n\n3.3\n\nEntanglement\n\nQBs may also be differentiated from other quantum states when measuring the\ndegree of entanglement [33, 34]. For the dimer and the trimer the degree of\nentanglement in the eigenstates may be measured by minimizing the distance\nof a given state to the space of product states of the dimer part (expanded by\nthe product basis {|n1 i \u2297 |n2 i}), which depends on the largest eigenvalue of the\ncorresponding reduced density matrix [35, 36, 37, 29]:\n\u2206=\n\nN\nX\n\nn1 ,n2\n\n(\u03c7n1 ,n2 \u2212 fn1 gn2 )2 ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere for the case of the dimer \u03c7n1 ,n2 = hn1 , n2 |\u03c7i, and for the trimer \u03c7n1 ,n2 =\nhn1 , n2 , (n3 = b \u2212 n1 \u2212 n2 )|\u03c7i.

Right\npanel: The density of the symmetric eigenstates marked by labeled arrows in\nleft panel-a: (a) S-0 (arrow 1), (b) S-7 (arrow 2), (c) S-9 (arrow 3), (d) S-19\n(arrow 4).\n\nminimum [29]. \u2206 measures how far a given eigenstate of the system is from\nbeing a product of single-site states, and has values 0 < \u2206 < 1. This measure\nhas a direct relation to the distance of a given eigenstate from a possible one\nobtained after performing a Hartree approximation [35].\nFor the dimer, since QB states are close to eigenstates of the C = 0 case\n1\n|\u03c7iQB \u2243 \u221a (|n, 0i \u00b1 |0, ni),\n2\n\n(33)\n\nwith n . b, one expects that the degree of entanglement in QB states is similar\nto the degree of entanglement in such states. Since only two basis states are\ninvolved, it can not be a state of maximum entanglement. For C = 0 the\neigenstates of the system are the basis states given by eq. (29), where for\nn1 = n2 it follows that \u2206 = 0, and for n1 6= n2 (which includes the state in eq.\n33) \u2206 = 0.5.\nIn previous works in a similar quantum dimer model [33, 34], it was shown\nthat at the energy threshold for appearance of QB states the entanglement (in\nthis case measured in a different way) becomes maximum and then decreases\nwith energy. From this, and the above reasoning, we expect that QB states\nshow decreasing entanglement \u2206 with energy, tending to 0.5. Results in left\npanel-a of Fig. 19 agree with this expectation.\nFor C = 0, the entanglement has the values 0 and 0.5 corresponding to the\nbasis states |b/2, b/2i and |n, b \u2212 ni (n 6= b/2) with equal and distinct number\nof quanta at each site respectively. When C > 0, the eigenstates become linear\nsuperpositions of the basis states and the entanglement rises, being larger as\nlong as more basis states are involved in building up an eigenstate. This can be\n24\n\n\fseen in the right panel of Fig. 19, where we plot the density \u03c1(n1 , n2 = b\u2212n1 ) =\n|hn1 , b \u2212 n1|\u03c7i|2 \u2261 \u03c1(n1 ) of four symmetric eigenstates marked by labeled arrows\nin the left panel: The low-energy eigenstate marked by the arrow 1 consists\nmainly of one basis state: |b/2, b/2i, as seen in the right panel-a, hence the\nentanglement is relatively small. When going up in energy the entanglement in\nthe eigenstates quickly increases, becoming maximum at the energy threshold,\nand then decreases. An eigenstate just before the threshold like the one marked\nby the arrow 2 in the left panel involves many basis states fulfilling n1 + n2 =\nb = 40 (right panel-b), hence the entanglement is large. However, for a QB\nstate lying in the energy region beyond the threshold, like the one marked by\nthe arrow 3 in the left panel, the number of involved basis states, and thus\nthe entanglement starts to decrease (right panel-c). Finally, in high-energy\neigenstates like the one marked by the arrow 4 in the left panel, which has the\nform shown in eq. (33) (right panel-d), the entanglement is even smaller and\ngets close to 0.5 as expected.\nFrom the above results we see that by measuring entanglement one may\ngain information not only about the energy threshold for existence of QBs (also\nvisible when measuring the energy splitting and correlation function), but also\nabout how many basis states overlap strongly with the eigenstate under consideration. We also computed the von Neumann entropy [38], which is another\nstandard measure of entanglement, and the results were consistent with those\ndiscussed above.\n\n4\n\nQuantum edge-localized states\n\nMost of the studies about QBs in large lattices (with few bosons) were done\nconsidering a system with periodic boundary conditions, and thus, translational\ninvariant. However, ususally real systems have to be modeled with open boundary conditions. Hence it is natural to wonder what hapens with QBs when the\nlattice has finite size, and therefore, no translational invariance.\nIn the classical case, it has been shown that in finite nonlinear lattices,\nthe breaking of the translational symmetry may lead to the formation of so\ncalled nonlinear edge states. These are excitations which are localized at the\nedges of the lattice and they have been studied, in particular, in nonlinear\noptics experiments employing optical waveguides, being coined with the name\nof discrete surface solitons [39]. In particular, it is well known that the discrete\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (DNLS) has time-periodic solutions localized at\nthe edge of the lattice [40, 41]. It is therefore expected that the large-boson\nlimit of the open-boundary Bose-Hubbard model will show eigenstates in which\nthe bosons are localized at the edge.\nNumerical studies by Pouthier were done to answer the edge-localization\nquestion in a lattice with a few bosons [42], where the mean-field approximation\n(DNLS equation) cannot a priori be expected to provide the correct intuition.\nThe answer turns out to be subtle - this phenomenon is not present for the\ncase of two particles, but appears when the particle number is three or more\n\n25\n\n\f2\n\n<>\nnj\n\n0\n\n\u03bd = 9 (edge state)\n\u03bd = 10 (edge state)\n\u03bd=1\n\u03bd=2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n<>\nnj\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n2 4 6 8 10\nj\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nj\nFigure 20: Spatial profile of site occupancies for several eigenstates of the threeboson Bose-Hubbard chain.

Inset shows the same plot in semilog scale, the linear\nbehavior indicating exponential localization in the edge states. This image was\ntaken from Ref. [43]\n\n[42]. Further studies focused on the energy spectrum and eigenstates (Fig. 20)\nwere done by Pinto et al [43], where degenerate perturbation theory allowed to\nexplain why edge-localized states exist only if the number of particles is three\nor more [43].\n\n5\n\nQuantum breathers with fermions\n\nAdvances in experimental techniques of manipulation of ultracold atoms in optical lattices make it feasible to explore the physics of few-body interactions.\nSystems with few quantum particles on lattices have new unexpected features\nas compared to the condensed matter case of many-body interactions, where\nexcitation energies are typically small compared to the Fermi energy. Therefore\nit is of interest to study binding properties of fermionic pairs with total spin\nzero, as recently presented in Ref.[44]. We use the extended Hubbard model,\nwhich contains two interaction scales - the on site interaction U and the nearest neighbour intersite interaction V . The nonlocal interaction V is added in\ncondensed matter physics to emulate remnants of the Coulomb interaction due\nto non-perfect screening of electronic charges. For fermionic ultracold atoms or\nmolecules with magnetic or electric dipole-dipole interactions, it can be tuned\nwith respect to the local interaction U by modifying the trap geometry of a condensate, additional external dc electric fields, combinations with fast rotating\nexternal fields, etc (for a review and relevant references see [45]).\nConsider a one-dimensional lattice with f sites and periodic boundary condi-\n\n26\n\n\ftions described by the extended Hubbard model with the following Hamiltonian:\n\u0124 = \u01240 + \u0124U + \u0124V ,\nwhere\n\u01240 = \u2212\n\nX\n\n(34)\n\n\u00e2+\nj,\u03c3 (\u00e2j\u22121,\u03c3 + \u00e2j+1,\u03c3 ) ,\n\n(35)\n\nj,\u03c3\n\n\u0124U = \u2212U\n\nX\n\nn\u0302j,\u2191 n\u0302j,\u2193 , n\u0302j,\u03c3 = \u00e2+\nj,\u03c3 \u00e2j,\u03c3 ,\n\n(36)\n\n\u0124V = \u2212V\n\nX\n\nn\u0302j n\u0302j+1 , n\u0302j = n\u0302j,\u2191 + n\u0302j,\u2193 .\n\n(37)\n\nj\n\nj\n\n\u01240 describes the nearest-neighbor hopping of fermions along the lattice. Here\nthe symbols \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 stand for a fermion with spin up or down. \u0124U describes\nthe onsite interaction between the particles, and \u0124V the intersite interaction of\nfermions located at adjacent sites. \u00e2+\nj,\u03c3 and \u00e2j,\u03c3 are the fermionic creation and\nannihilation operators satisfying the corresponding anticommutation relations:\n+\n+\n{\u00e2+\nj,\u03c3 , \u00e2l,\u03c3\u2032 } = \u03b4j,l \u03b4\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 , {\u00e2j,\u03c3 , \u00e2l,\u03c3\u2032 } = {\u00e2j,\u03c3 , \u00e2l,\u03c3\u2032 } = 0. Note that throughout\nthis work we consider U and V positive, which leads to bound states located\nbelow the two-particle continuum. A change of the sign of U, V will simply swap\nthe energies.\nTo observe the fermionic character of the considered states, any two-particle\nnumber state is generated from the vacuum |Oi by first creating a particle with\n+\nspin down, and then a particle with spin up: e.g. \u00e2+\n2,\u2191 \u00e21,\u2193 |Oi creates a particle\n+\nwith spin down on site 1 and one with spin up on site 2, while \u00e2+\n2,\u2191 \u00e22,\u2193 |Oi creates\nboth particles with spin down and up on site 2.\nDue to periodic boundary conditions the Hamiltonian (34) commutes also\nwith the translation operator T\u0302 , which shifts all lattice indices by one. It has\neigenvalues \u03c4 = exp(ik), with Bloch wave number k = 2\u03c0\u03bd\nf and \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, ..., f \u2212\n1.\nFor the case of having only one fermion (either spin up or spin down) in\nthe lattice (n = 1), a number state has the form |ji = \u00e2+\nj,\u03c3 |Oi. The interaction\nterms \u0124U and \u0124V do not contribute.

The details of the calculations can be found in [44].\nIn Fig. 21 we show the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian matrix obtained\nby numerical diagonalization for the interaction parameters U = 2 and V =\n2 and f = 101. At U = 0 and V = 0, the spectrum is given by the two\nfermion continuum, whose eigenstates are characterized by the two fermions\nindependently moving along the lattice. In this case the eigenenergies are the\nsum of the two single-particle energies:\nEk01 ,k2 = \u22122[cos(k1 ) + cos(k2 )],\n\n(40)\n\nwith k1,2 = \u03c0\u03bd1,2 /(f + 1) , \u03bd1,2 = 1, . . . , f . The Bloch wave number k = k1 + k2\nmod 2\u03c0. Therefore, if k = \u00b1\u03c0, the continuum degenerates into points. The continuum is bounded by the hull curves h\u00b1 (k) = \u00b14 cos k2 . The same two-particle\ncontinuum is still observed in Fig. 21 for nonzero interaction. However, in addition to the continuum, we observe one, two or three bound states dropping out\nof the continuum, which depends on the wave number. For any nonzero U and\nV , all three bound states drop out of the continuum at k = \u00b1\u03c0. One of them\nstays bounded for all values of k. The two other ones merge with the continuum\nat some critical value of |k| upon approaching k = 0 as observed in Fig.21. Note\nthat for k = \u00b1\u03c0 and U = V , all three bound states are degenerate.\nUpon increasing U and V , we observe that a second bound state band separates from the continuum for all k (Fig.22). At the same time, when U 6= V ,\nthe degeneracy at k = \u00b1\u03c0 is reduced to two.\nFinally, for even larger values of U and V , all three bound state bands\ncompletely separate from the continuum (Fig.23).\n28\n\n\f8\nAntisymmetric bound states\nSymmetric bound states\nSymmetric bound states\n\n6\n4\n\nENERGY\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-1\n\ns2\n\nkc/\u03c0\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\nk/\u03c0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 22: (Color online) Energy spectrum of the two fermion states.

We define symmetric basis states\n1\n|\u03a6j,s i = \u221a (|\u03a6j,+ i + |\u03a6j,\u2212 i)\n2\n\n(41)\n\nand antisymmetric states\n1\n|\u03a6j,a i = \u221a (|\u03a6j,+ i \u2212 |\u03a6j,\u2212 i) .\n2\n\n(42)\n\nNote that |\u03a61 i is a symmetric state as well.\n\n5.2\n\nAntisymmetric bound states\n\nThe antisymmetric states exclude double occupation. Therefore the spectrum\nis identical with the one of two spinless fermions [13]. Following the derivations\nin [13] we find that the antisymmetric bound state, if it exists, has an energy\nE2a (k) = \u2212(V +\n\n4\nk\ncos2 ( )) .\nV\n2\n\n(43)\n\nThis result is valid as long as the bound state energy stays outside of the continuum.

We also note, that the antisymmetric bound state\nis located between the two symmetric bound states, which we discuss next.\n\n5.3\n\nSymmetric bound states\n\nA bound state can be searched for by assuming an unnormalized eigenvector of\nthe form |c, 1, \u03bc, \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 , ...i with |\u03bc| \u2261 \u03c1 \u2264 1.

We obtain excellent agreement.\n\n30\n\n\fAt the Brilloin zone edge k = \u00b1\u03c0 the cubic equation (46) is reduced to a\nquadratic one, and can be solved to obtain finally \u03c1 \u2192 0 and\nE2s1 (k \u2192 \u00b1\u03c0) = \u2212U , E2s2 (k \u2192 \u00b1\u03c0) = \u2212V .\n\n(47)\n\nIn particular we find for k = \u00b1\u03c0 that E2s2 = E2a . In addition, if U = V , all\nthree bound states degenerate at the zone edge.\nIf V = 0, the cubic equation (46) is reduced to a quadratic one in the whole\nrange of k and yields [13]\np\nE2s1 (k) = \u2212 U 2 + 16 cos2 (k/2) .\n(48)\n\nNext we determine the critical value of k for which the bound state with\nenergy E2s2 is joining the continuum.

For U = 4 and V = 3 we find kcs2 /\u03c0 \u2248 0.59\nconfirming numerical results in Fig.22.\n\n6\n\nSmall Josephson junction networks\n\nRecent studies of Pinto et al [28, 29] deal with quantum breather excitations in\ntwo capacitively coupled Josephson junctions. Such systems are currently under\nexperimental investigation, being candidates for quantum information processing, and show remarkably long coherence times up to 100 ns for few quanta\nexcitations. The system does not conserve the number of excited quanta, and\ncan be best compared with the above Bose-Hubbard trimer. Quantum breather\nsignatures are found simultaneously in the spectra (tunneling splittings), correlation functions, entanglement, and quanta number fluctuations.\nWe address the excitation of QBs in a system of two coupled Josephson junctions in the quantum regime [29]. Josephson junctions are nonlinear devices that\nshow macroscopic quantum behavior, and nowadays they can be manipulated\nwith high precision, in such a way that the energy flow between coupled junctions can be resolved in time.\nJosephson junctions behave like anharmonic oscillators, and by lowering the\ntemperature one can bring them into the quantum regime, where their quantization leads to energy levels which are nonequidistant because of the anharmonicity. These levels can be separately excited by using microwaves pulses,\nand the energy distribution between the junctions can be measured in time using\nsubsequent pulses [46]. So far these techniques have been used for experiments\non quantum information processing with Josephson junctions [47, 48, 49], but\nwe think that arrays of Josephson junctions in the qunatum regime also might\n31\n\n\fIb\n\nCc\n\nU(\u03c6 )\n\nIb\n\nIb\n\nIb\n\nCc\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u2206U\n\nCJ\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c60\n\n\u03c6\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nCJ\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 24: (a) Sketch of the two capacitively coupled Josephson junctions.\n(b) Sketch of the washboard potential for a single current-biased Josephsonjunction.

The strength of the coupling due to\nthe capacitor is \u03b6 = Cc /(Cc +CJ ). The dynamics of a biased Josephson junction\n(JJ) is analogous to the dynamics of a particle with a mass proportional to the\njunction capacitance CJ , moving on a tilted washboard potential\nU (\u03c6) = \u2212Ic\n\n\u03a60\n\u03a60\ncos \u03c6 \u2212 Ib \u03c6 ,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(50)\n\nwhich is sketched in Fig.24-b. Here \u03c6 is the phase difference between the macroscopic wave functions in both superconducting electrodes of the junction, Ib is\nthe bias current, Ic is the critical current of the junction, and \u03a60 = h/2e the\nflux quantum. When the energy of the particle is large enough to overcome the\nbarrier \u2206U (that depends on the bias current Ib ) it escapes and moves down the\npotential, switching the junction into a resistive state with a nonzero voltage\nproportional to \u03c6\u0307 across it. Quantization of the system leads to discrete energy\nlevels inside the potential wells, which are nonequidistant because of the anharmonicity. Note that even if there is not enough energy to classically overcome\nthe barrier, the particle may perform a quantum escape and tunnel outside the\nwell, thus switching the junction into the resistive state. Thus each state inside\nthe well is characterized by a bias and state-dependent lifetime, or its inverse\n-the escape rate.\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is\nH=\n\nP2\n\u03b6\nP12\n+ 2 + U (\u03c61 ) + U (\u03c62 ) + P1 P2 ,\n2m 2m\nm\n\n32\n\n(51)\n\n\f0\n\n\u2206E /h (GHz)\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\nf\u03bc(1,2)/f\u03bc(1,1)\n\n10\n\n(b)\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n-3\n\n10 0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n150\nE /h (GHz)\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 25: (a) Energy splitting and (b) correlation function vs. energy of the\neigenstates of the two-junctions system (open circles, symmetric eigenstates;\nfilled circles, antisymmetric eigenstates).

In Fig.25 we show the nearest neighbor\nenergy spacing (tunneling splitting) and the correlation function of the eigenstates. For this, and all the rest, we used Ic = 13.3 \u03bcA, CJ = 4.3 pF, and\n\u03b6 = 0.1, which are typical values in experiments. We see that in the central\npart of the spectrum the energy splitting becomes small in comparison to the\naverage. The corresponding pairs of eigenstates, which are tunneling pairs, are\nsite correlated, and thus QBs. In these states many quanta are localized on\none junction and the tunneling time of such an excitation from one junction\nto the other (given by the inverse energy splitting between the eigenstates of\nthe pair) can be exponentially large and depend sensitively on the number of\nquanta excited.\nNote that the tunneling of quanta between the JJs occurs without an obvious\npotential energy barrier being present (the interaction between the junctions is\n33\n\n\f0.4\n\n(a)\n\n<n1> + <n2>\n<n1>\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n<n2>\n\n<n1> + <n2>\n\n<n1>\n\n<ni>\n\n<n2>\nBreather\n\n0\n\n<n1>\n\n<n2>\n\n<n1> + <n2>\n\nNo breathers\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\ntime (ns)\n\nSPECTRAL INTENSITY\n\n<ni>\n\n(e)\n\n10\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n(d)\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0\n20\n\n(b)\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\n(c)\n\n20\n\n10\n\nNo breathers\n\nSPECTRAL INTENSITY\n\n<ni>\n\n5\n\nSPECTRAL INTENSITY\n\n6\n\n(f)\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n\n0\n\n100 200 300\nE /h (GHz)\n\nFigure 26: Time evolution of expectation values of the number of quanta at\neach junction (left panels) for different initial excitations with corresponding\nspectral intensities (right panels).

The parameters\nare \u03b3 = Ib/Ic = 0.945 and \u03b6 = 0.1 (22 levels per junction).\n\nonly through their momenta). This process has been coined dynamical tunneling [50, 51, 52], to distinguish from the usual tunneling through a potential\nbarrier. In dynamical tunneling, the barrier -a so-called invariant separatrix\nmanifold- is only visible in phase space, where it separates two regions of regular classical motion between which the tunneling process takes place. Therefore,\nwhen referring to the tunneling between the JJs, we implicitly mean that it is\ndynamical.\nThe fact that the strongest site correlated eigenstates occur in the central\npart of the energy spectrum may be easily explained as follows: Let N be the\nhighest excited state in a single junction, with a corresponding maximum energy\n\u2206U (Fig.24). For two junctions the energy of the system with both junctions\nin the N -th state is 2\u2206U , which roughly is the width of the full spectrum.\nThus states of the form |N, 0i and |0, N i that have energy \u2206U are located\napproximately in the middle.\nHaving the eigenvalues and eigenstates, we compute the time evolution of\ndifferent initially localized excitations, and the expectation value of the num-\n\n34\n\n\f20\n\n\u22125\n\nn\n\n2\n\n15\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\u221215\n5\n\u221220\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nn1\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 27: Contour plot of the logarithm of the density of the asymmetric state\n\u221a\n(S)\n(A)\n|\u03c7i = (|\u03c7b i + |\u03c7b i)/ 2 as a function of the number of quanta at junctions 1\nand 2 (see text).

Results are shown in\nFig.26a, c, and e. We also compute the spectral intensity I\u03bc0 = |h\u03c7\u03bc |\u03a80 i|2 , which\nmeasures the strength of overlap of the initial state |\u03a80 i with the eigenstates.\nResults are shown in Fig.26-b, d, and f, where we can see a peak in each case,\nwhich corresponds to the arrows in Fig.25-b. We can see that the initial state\n|\u03a80 i = |0, 5i overlaps with eigenstates with an energy splitting between them\nbeing relatively large and hence the tunneling time of the initially localized\nexcitation is short. For the case |\u03a80 i = |0, 19i QBs are excited: The excitation overlaps strongly with tunneling pairs of eigenstates in the central part of\nthe spectrum, which are site correlated and nearly degenerate. The tunneling\ntime of such an excitation is very long, and thus keeps the quanta localized\non their initial excitation site for corresponding times. Finally the initial state\n|\u03a80 i = |9, 19i overlaps with weakly site correlated eigenstates with large energy\nsplitting. Hence the tunneling time is short again.\nWe computed also the time evolution of the expectation values of the number\nof quanta for initial conditions which are coherent or incoherent (mixtures)\nsuperpositions of product basis states with equal weights. This is relevant for\nexperiments, since it may be hard to excite one junction to a determined state\nbut easier to excite several states of the junction at the same time. We used\ncoherent superpositions (characterized by well defined states |\u03a80 i), and mixtures\n(characterized by their corresponding density operators \u03c1\u03020 ), of four basis states\naround the already used initial states: For the state |0, 5i we superposed the\nbasis states |0, 5i, |0, 6i, |0, 7i, and |0, 8i, for |0, 19i the basis states |0, 20i,\n|0, 19i, |0, 18i, and |0, 17i, and for |9, 19i the basis states |9, 20i, |9, 19i, |9, 18i,\nand |9, 17i. Both for superposition and mixture of basis states, the results are\nqualitatively similar to those shown in Fig.26. Therefore we expect that some\nimprecision in exciting an initial state in the junctions would not affect in a\n35\n\n\frelevant way the results. we may also conclude, that the excitation of QB states\ndoes not rely on the phase coherence.\nLet us estimate how many quanta should be excited in the junctions in\norder to obtain QBs (tunneling pairs). We compute the density \u03c1(n1 , n2 ) =\n\u221a\n(S)\n(A)\n(S,A)\n|hn1 , n2 |\u03c7i|2 of the asymmetric state |\u03c7i = (|\u03c7b i + |\u03c7b i)/ 2, where |\u03c7b\ni\nare the eigenstates belonging to a tunneling pair [29]. In Fig. 27 we show a\ncontour plot of the logarithm of the density for the tunneling pair with energy\nmarked by the arrow labeled by number two in Fig. 25-(b). We see that the\ndensity has its maximum around n1 = 19 and n2 = 0 which is consistent with\nthe result shown in Fig. 26-c and d where QBs were excited by using this\ncombination of quanta in the junctions.\n\n7\n\nExperimental realizations\n\nThere is a fast growing amount of experimental and related theoretical work on\napplying the quantum discrete breather concept to many different branches in\nphysics, like Bose-Einstein condensates, crystals and molecules, surfaces, and\nothers. We will discuss some of these at length, while others will be reviewed\nmore briefly.\n\n7.1\n\nRepulsively bound atom pairs\n\nWinkler et al [53] performed experiments with a three-dimensional optical lattice with initially each site being either not occupied, or being occupied by two\nRb atoms bound in a pair due to attractive interaction. A magnetic field sweep\nacross the Feshbach resonance changes the sign of interaction, turning attraction\ninto repulsion. The dynamics of ultracold atoms loaded into the lowest band of\nthe optical potential is described by the quantum DNLS model, which is equivalent to the Bose-Hubbard model (10). Lifetime measurements have shown,\nthat repulsive pairs of Rb atoms have larger lifetimes than pairs of weakly or almost not interacting atoms (Fig.28). The two-particle bound states discussed in\nchapter 2.1 - the simplest versions of a quantum discrete breather - are the obvious explanation of the experimental findings. Indeed, neglecting Landau-Zener\ntransitions to higher lying bands in the optical potential, the Bose-Hubbard\nmodel is justified. The sign of the interaction does not play any role, since it\nonly changes quantum discrete breathers from being low-lying to being excited\nstates, not affecting their localization properties. The most simple argument of\nwhy two quanta (or atoms) placed initially close to each other, do not separate\ndespite they repel each other, is based on the fact, that if they would do so,\nthe (large) interaction energy should be converted into kinetic energy, which is\nrestricted to be less than two times the width of the single particle band. In\nother words, repulsively bound atom pairs are a straightforward consequence of\nquantum discrete breather states with two quanta.\nAnother sophisticated experimental investigation aimed at measuring the\nquasi-momentum distribution of atom pairs in various regimes by mapping it\n36\n\n\fFigure 28: (a) Repulsive interaction between two atoms sharing a lattice site\ngives rise to an interaction energy U . Breaking up of the pair is suppressed\nowing to the lattice band structure and energy conservation. This is the simplest\nversion of a quantum discrete breather.

The plot shows\nthe remaining fraction of pairs for strong interaction (open diamonds) and for\nalmost vanishing interaction (filled circles).

Therefore predictions of such states, which were made\nmore than 30 years ago by Ovchinnikov [54], were beautifully confirmed experimentally with ultracold repulsive atoms.\n\n7.2\n\nMolecules\n\nIntramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) has been a central issue in the field of chemical physics for many decades. In particular, pathways\nand rates are of importance there, since understanding them allows to describe\ne.g. the dynamics of various chemical reactions, and dissociation processes [55].\nSpectroscopical studies, where single vibrational quanta are excited, allow to\nmeasure the frequencies of normal vibrational modes, i.e. to characterize the\ndynamics of a molecule for small amplitude vibrations. These normal modes\nconsist of coherent combinations of vibrational excitations of several bonds (or\nrotational groups) in a molecule. However, in order e.g. to dissociate a molecule,\na many quanta excitation is needed, and nonlinearities will certainly become important. It was realized then, that strong vibrational excitations of molecules are\nmuch better described by so-called local modes, i.e. basically one or few bond\n37\n\n\fFigure 29: (Upper row) Absorption images of the atomic distribution after\nrelease from the 3D lattice and a subsequent 15 ms time of flight.

A practically complete modern theoretical account on\nthese issues can be found in a recent monography by Ovchinnikov, Erikhman\nand Pronin [56]. On its most abstract level, the transition from normal to local\nmodes is identical with the bifurcation in the dimer model. Thus, local modes\nare essentially discrete breathers or slight perturbations of them. Note, that\nthe connection between local modes, breathers and periodic orbits has been\nrecently studied by Farantos in the context of large biological molecules [57].\nDiscrete breathers (ILMs) have been theoretically predicted to exist in ionic\ncrystals [58], ways of optical excitation of DBs (ILMs) have been proposed [59],\nand their possible presence in hydrocarbon structures has been discussed [60].\nExciting local modes in molecules with discrete symmetries leads to small\ntunneling splittings of excitation levels [56], and goes back to the work of Child\nand Lawton [61], see also a recent comprehensive review by Keshavamurthy [62]\nand references therein. On its most abstract level, this effect is identical with\nthe tunneling splitting in the permutationally symmetric dimer model discussed\nin chapter 2.2.\nAn early example of experimental evidence of discrete breather excitations in\nmolecules comes from spectroscopical studies of visible red absorption spectra of\nbenzene, naphtalene, and anthracene by Swofford et al [64]. The C-H stretching\nvibrations have been excited to the sixth quantum level, and red shifts of the\nlines show, that instead of a delocalized excitation of six bonds to the first\nlevel (yielding six quanta), the excitation resides on just one of the six available\n\n38\n\n\fFigure 30: (a) Absorption spectra of PBLG in chloroform at 293 K (red line,\nhelical conformation) and at 260 K (blue line, random coil).

While it can tunnel (as a quantum discrete breather) to the other bonds,\nthis tunneling time is a new large time scale in the problem, strongly affecting\ne.g. dissociation rates.\nA recent study of femtosecond infrared pump-probe spectroscopy of the NH mode of a stable \u03b1-helix (poly-\u03b3-benzyl-L-glutamate (PBLG)) revealed two\nexcited-state absorption bands, which disappear upon unfolding of the helix [63].\nPBLG forms extremely stable, long \u03b1-helices in both helicogenic solvents and\nfilms grown from these solvents. The monomeric unit of PBLG is a non-natural\namino-acid with a long side chain that stabilizes the helix. PBLG has served as\nthe standard model helix since the very early days of structural investigations\nof proteins. Fig.30(a) (red line) shows the absorption spectrum of the helix at\n293 K, which is dominated by the strong N-H stretching band at 3290 cm\u22121 .\nFig.30(b) (red line) shows the pump-probe response 600 fs after excitation with\nan ultrashort broadband pulse. One negative (3280 cm\u22121 ) and two positive\nbands (3160 and 3005 cm\u22121 ) are observed. If the N-H stretching modes were\nisolated, a negative band associated with bleach and stimulated emission, and a\npositive band associated with excited-state absorption, would be expected. This\n\n39\n\n\fFigure 31: Simulated pump-probe spectrum for 293 K (red line) and 18 K (blue\nline). Inset: schematic of the energy levels. Adapted from [63].\n\nis indeed observed here for the unfolded molecule. In contrast, the observation\nof two positive bands for the intact helix rather than just one, is exceptional.\nEdler et al [63] argue, that these features can not be explained due to intensity dependencies, or Fermi resonances. A consistent explanation is reached\nby assuming that two vibron states are excited, and these vibrons may form\ntwo different types of bound states, self trapped either on the same site, or on\nneighbouring ones. The latter states originate from the acoustic phonons of the\nhelix, which correlate adjacent sites (see also [65]).\n\n7.3\n\nCrystal surfaces\n\nDepositing atoms or molecules on crystal surfaces can be controlled experimentally, and as a result a planar regular two-dimensional lattice structure of the\ndeposited material can be obtained. Guyot-Sionnest [66] used Hydrogen to be\ndeposited on Si(111) surfaces. The Si-H bonds can be excited using pum-probe\ntechniques with infrared dye lasers. There is substantial interaction between the\nSi-H bonds on the Si(111) surface. The pump excites one phonon (quantum),\nwhile the tunable probe frequency finds a substantial red shift of the two-phonon\nexcitation, and allows to conclude, that two-phonon bound states are observed.\nAnother set of experiments was performed by Jakob [67, 68, 69]. Carbon\nmonoxide (CO) was deposited on a Ru(001) single crystal surface. The C-O\nstretching modes constitute a two-dimensional array of weakly interacting an-\n\n40\n\n\fFigure 32: (a) Infrared absorption spectra of the C-O stretching mode at 30\nK.

Adapted from [67].\n\nharmonic oscillators with 4.7 \u00c5 intermolecular distance. Intermolecular coupling\nis provided by means of the electric field of the oscillating dipoles. Experimental spectra at 30 K are shown in Fig.32. The one phonon mode frequency is\nat 2031 cm\u22121 . This has to be compared to the naturally abundant 13 C16 O\nfrequency at 1941 cm\u22121 . The corresponding blue shift for the adsorbate is thus\ndue to additional stiffness provided by the Ru surface coupling. Excitation of\ntwo uncorrelated phonons would yield a two phonon continuum at about 4062\ncm\u22121 . The narrow line observed at 3940 cm\u22121 can be thus attributed to a\ntwo-phonon bound state, or a quantum discrete breather excitation.\nThe temperature dependence of the line positions also clearly shows, that the\ntwo-phonon bound state line softens much slower than the line of the one-phonon\n\n41\n\n\fFigure 34: Structure of the PtCl crystal. One PtCl chain is shown on the left.\nEach Pt atom is coordinated by two ethylenediamine units in a near square\nplanar geometry, while Cl ions connect pt sites along the chain.

This is, among other facts, a strong indication that\nthe observed red shift of the overtone line is due to the formation of a localized\ntwo-phonon bound state, or a (quantum) discrete breather.\n7.3.1\n\nIn the bulk of solids\n\nVibrational spectra in the overtone or combination region of molecular crystals\nhave been studied intensively in the 1970s and 1980s. A pioneering theoretical\nproposal was due to Agranovich, who predicted the existence of two-exciton\nbound states in various molecular crystal materials [70]. Experimental studies\nof infrared absorption spectra for CO2 crystals were conducted by Dows et al\n[71] and gave evidence of two-phonon bound states. Dressler et al studied the\nslow vibrational relaxation of N2 , which also indicates the presence of manyphonon bound states [72]. In a remarkable theoretical paper, Bogani calculated\nthe spectrum of two phonon excitations in molecular crystals [73], to some\nextent one of the first accurate calculations of quantum discrete breathers. More\nrecently Bini et al reconsidered the theory of three-phonon bound states in\ncrystal CO2 [74]. While there certainly are many other results worth to be\nmentioned, we recommend reading related chapters in [75],[56].\nThe pioneering studies of Swanson et al [76] have shown that up to seven\nphonons can bind and form a localized state. The system of choice was a PtCl\nbased crystal - a halide-bridged mixed-valence transition metal complex, which\nis a model low-dimensional electronic material where the ground states can be\nsystematically tuned (with chemistry, doping, pressure, and temperature). It\nis a very strong charge-density wave (CDW) example. The material is a well-\n\n42\n\n\fFigure 35: Fundamental and overtone spectra of isotopically pure Pt35 Cl. Moving upward in each panel, each x axis is offset by the appropriate integral multiple of the 312 cm\u22121 fundamental frequency. All spectra have been scaled\nvertically to equal peak intensities. Adapted from [76].\n\nformed crystal with a homogeneous lattice consisting of quasi-1D chains (see\nFig.34). The CDW ground state consists of alternating Pt+2 and Pt+4 sites\nwith a corresponding distortion of the chloride ions towards the Pt+4 site. Resonance Raman spectra were used to probe both ground and photoexcited states.\nThey probe the fundamental Cl-Pt-Cl stretch and the progression of many overtones. At low temperatures, the fundamental exhibits a fine structure with up\nto six discrete, well-resolved modes. The analysis of the evolution of the spectral structure in the overtones was performed for isotopically pure samples, in\norder to avoid exciting localized states due to isotopic disorder. The fundamental and overtone spectra for the pure Pt35 Cl sample are shown in Fig.35. The\ndata are presented in a stack plot in which each successive trace is offset along\nthe horizontal axis by increasing multiples of the fundamental frequency 312\ncm\u22121 . Such plots clearly expose the relation of features in the overtone spectrum to multiples of the fundamental peak. The lowest energy dominant feature\nin each trace (marked by vertical lines) demonstrates a strongly increasing anharmonic redshift. Further, at higher overtones, each of these dominant peaks\nrecurs, offset by the fundamental frequency, in the next trace above. A simple\ninterpretation is that the lowest-energy dominant peaks in the overtone spectra\ncorrespond to all quanta of vibrational energy localized in approximately one\nPtCl2 unit, while the higher energy peaks correspond to having all quanta but\none in a localized PtCl2 unit combined with one quanta in the more extended\nfundamental. The schematic process of the energy transfer is shown in Fig.36\nand has been analyzed theoretically in [77].\n\n43\n\n\fFigure 36: A simple picture of a resonant Raman scattering event in the localized\natomic limit. Large filled circles mark Pt ions, small grey circles mark Cl ions.\nOpen circles mark the positions of electrons. Adapted from [77].\n\nAn incoming photon at frequency \u03bd is exciting an electron from a Pt+2 to\na Pt+4 site. The Cl ion between them starts oscillating. Finally the electron\nrelaxes back to its original position, and releases a photon with frequency \u03bd \u2032 .\nThe energy difference is remaining in a localized vibration. The effect of isotope\ndisorder was treated by Kalosakas et al [78]. The experimentally observed redshifts were also theoretically described by Fehske et al [79] using Peierls-Hubbard\nmodels, and by Wellein et al using the Holstein model [80].\nInelastic X-ray and neutron scattering was used by Manley et al [81, 82, 83] to\nprobe phonon dispersion in \u03b1-uranium single crystals. Variation of temperature\nshowed softening, and the abrupt appearance of a new dynamical mode, without\na typically observed phase transition. The authors argue that this mode is a\ndiscrete breather, and forms due to strong electron-phonon interaction.\nRussell and Eilbeck reported evidence for moving breathers in the layered\ncrystal muscovite at 300 K [84]. Breathers were created by bombardment of the\ncrystal surface with heavy ions. Ejection of atoms at the opposite (shielded)\ncrystal surface was attributed to breathers, which were able to carry the vibrational energy without dispersing over more than 107 unit cells of the crystal.\n\n44\n\n\fFinally Abrasonis et al [85] reported on anomalous bulk diffusion of interstitial Nitrogen in steel microcrystals. N ions were deposited in a micron-thick\nlayer, and are trapped by local structures, with a characteristic binding energy.\nAr ion bombardment increases the N mobility at depths far beyond the ion\npenetration depth. The authors see evidence for coherent transfer of vibrational\nenergy deep into the bulk of the material.\n\n8\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nProgress in the understanding of classical discrete breathers evolved for two\ndecades, and has significantly improved our understanding of the complexity in\nthe dynamics of anharmonic lattice dynamics. The little input it needs to form\ndiscrete breathers - spatial discreteness and nonlinearity - were demonstrated\nto generate an impressive list of experimental observations in a large variety of\ndifferent physical systems, with length and time scales ranging over many orders\nof magnitude. The quantization of the classical equations of motion opened a\nwhole new avenue of research on quantum breathers. For obvious computational\nreasons numerical studies are much more involved in the quantum domain, restricting our potential of detailed understanding to either small lattices, or few\nparticipating quanta. Nevertheless, a set of experiments, comparable in size\nto its classical counterpart, has been reviewed where quantum breathers are\ndetected. Still we anticipate this only to be the beginning of a much more sophisticated undertaking. We may expect many new qualities to show up in the\nregime of large lattices and many participating quanta. These limits are conceptually closing the gap to quantum interacting many body problems, which are\nat the heart of condensed matter physics, and quantum computing. Yet another\nhighly interesting, complicated and debated problem is the combined influence\nof discreteness, nonlinearity, and disorder. Linear disordered wave equations\nallow for Anderson localization. It is a thrilling modern theme to study the\nconstructive and destructive interplay of all three ingredients. The best is yet\nto come.\n\nReferences\n[1] P.W. Anderson, Phys. Rev. 109, 1492 (1958).\n[2] S. Flach and C. R. Willis, Phys. Rep. 295, 181 (1998).\n[3] D. K. Campbell, S. Flach, Y. S.
