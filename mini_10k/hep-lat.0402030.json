In this paper we describe the new simulations we have done, and\npresent spectrum results for the light hadrons and the static quark potential. In a previous\nwork[1] we presented results for these quantities from a set of runs with a lattice spacing\nof approximately 0.12 fm and light quark masses ranging down to 0.2 times the estimated\nstrange quark mass. Since that time we have extended the a \u2248 0.12 fm runs to smaller\nquark masses, and increased the statistics on the mu,d = 0.2 ms run. More importantly, we\nhave done simulations at a smaller lattice spacing of approximately 0.09 fm in quenched\nQCD and with three dynamical flavors at three values of the light quark mass: mu,d = ms ,\nmu,d = 0.4 ms and mu,d = 0.2 ms where ms is the strange quark mass estimated before doing\nthe simulations[2]. This enables us to address the question of lattice spacing effects, i.e.,\nextrapolation to the continuum, to greater accuracy than we could before. Two short runs\nwere made at larger integration step size than used in the main simulation as an additional\ncheck on the systematic errors in the simulation algorithm. At our smallest quark mass, we\nhave computed the hadron propagators in double precision on a subset of the lattices as a\ncheck on the numerical accuracy of the computations. Finally, we have done an explicit test\nof the effects of the finite spatial size of the simulated system by adding a run with a larger\nspatial size than in the main run.\nIn addition to the light hadron spectrum, the gluon configurations generated in this\nprogram are being used for computations of the static quark potential[3], heavy quark\nand heavy-light meson spectroscopy[4, 5], heavy-light meson decay constants[5, 6], f\u03c0 , fK ,\nand chiral O(p4 ) parameters [2, 7, 8], \u03b1s [9], exotic meson masses[10], the topological susceptibility in QCD[11], semileptonic form factors[12], quark masses[7, 13, 14], and parton\ndistributions[15]. For those quantities where accurate lattice results are available and systematic errors are relatively well understood, there is good agreement with experimental\nvalues among a large set of quantities[16]. While this work focuses on describing the simulations, the static potential, and the light hadron spectrum, results from these other quantities\nare important in our analysis. In particular, the \u03a5 mass splittings give the most accurate\nestimates of the lattice spacing, and several of these quantities enter into our estimates of\nthe correct strange quark mass. In turn, some of the results presented here, such as the\n3\n\n\fdependence of the static potential on the lattice spacing, and the tests of the effects of\nmolecular dynamics step size and spatial size of the lattices, are important in evaluating\nthese other works.\n\nII.\n\nSIMULATIONS\n\nThe simulations used here are a continuation those described in Ref. [1], which contains\na more detailed description of the simulation program. We use an improved Kogut-Susskind\nquark action, the \"a2tad \" or \"Asqtad\" action, which removes lattice artifacts up to order a2 g 2.\nConfigurations were generated using the hybrid-molecular dynamics \"R algorithm\"[17], with\nseparate pseudofermion fields for the light and strange quarks, except where all three quarks\nare degenerate. The momenta conjugate to the gauge fields were refreshed at the end of\nevery trajectory, with the trajectory length being one simulation time unit. Lattices were\narchived every six time units, and the hadron spectrum and static quark potential were\ncalculated on these stored lattices.\nTable I summarizes the parameters of the runs. For completeness, it includes runs reported in Ref. [1], although we will not repeat tabulation of masses from runs that have not\nbeen extended since that time. In identifying runs, we will quote the light (degenerate u\nand d) and strange quark masses as aml/s = 0.01/0.05, for example.\n\nIII.\n\nSTATIC POTENTIAL AND LENGTH SCALE\n\nWe use the static quark potential to relate the lattice spacings in our different runs. In\nparticular, we use the quantity r1 defined by r12 F (r1 ) = 1.00. We choose r1 because of\nits ease and accuracy of computation and lack of dependence on the valence quark mass.\nComputation of this quantity and the effects of dynamical quarks on the potential have been\ndiscussed in Refs. [1, 3]. Here we add points at smaller quark mass and, more importantly,\npoints at a finer lattice spacing which allow a preliminary continuum extrapolation. As\nbefore, we fit to the form in Ref. [18],\nV (~r) = C + \u03c3r \u2212 \u03b1/r + \u03bb (Vfree (~r) \u2212 1/r) .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Vfree(~r) is the potential calculated in free field theory, using the improved gauge action.\nThis lattice correction term is used at distances less than 3a.\n4\n\n\famu,d / ams\n\n10/g2 L\n\nquenched\n\n8.00\n\n20 0.8879 na\n\n0.02 / na\n\n7.20\n\n0.40 / 0.40\n\nu0\n\nres.\n\n\u01eb\n\nlats. a/r1\n\nna\n\n408\n\n0.3762(8)\n\n20 0.8755 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 0.013\n\n370\n\n0.3745(14)\n\n7.35\n\n20 0.8822 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.03\n\n332\n\n0.3766(10)\n\n0.20 / 0.20\n\n7.15\n\n20 0.8787 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.03\n\n341\n\n0.3707(10)\n\n0.10 / 0.10\n\n6.96\n\n20 0.8739 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.03\n\n339\n\n0.3730(14)\n\n0.05 / 0.05\n\n6.85\n\n20 0.8707 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 0.02\n\n425\n\n0.3742(15)\n\n0.04 / 0.05\n\n6.83\n\n20 0.8702 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.02\n\n351\n\n0.3765(14)\n\n0.03 / 0.05\n\n6.81\n\n20 0.8696 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.02\n\n564\n\n0.3775(12)\n\n0.02 / 0.05\n\n6.79\n\n20 0.8688 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 0.0133\n\n484\n\n0.3775(12)\n\n\u2217 0.01 / 0.05\n\n6.76\n\n20 0.8677 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 0.00667 658\n\n0.3852(14)\n\n\u2217 0.01 / 0.05\n\n6.76\n\n28 0.8677 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 0.00667 241\n\n0.3814(14)\n\n\u2217 0.007 / 0.05\n\n6.76\n\n20 0.8678 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 0.005\n\n493\n\n0.3783(13)\n\n\u2217 0.005 / 0.05\n\n6.76\n\n24 0.8678 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.003\n\n197\n\n0.3796(19)\n\n\u2217 quenched\n\n8.40\n\n28 0.8974 na\n\n396\n\n0.2681(5)\n\n\u2217 0.031 / 0.031\n\n7.18\n\n28 0.8808 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.02\n\n496\n\n0.2613(9)\n\n\u2217 0.0124 / 0.031 7.11\n\n28 0.8788 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.008\n\n527\n\n0.2698(9)\n\n\u2217 0.0062 / 0.031 7.09\n\n28 0.8782 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 0.004\n\n592\n\n0.2714(9)\n\nna\n\nTABLE I: Parameters of the improved action simulations. A \"*\" at the beginning of the line\nindicates a run which is new or has been extended since the report in Ref [1]. The first column\ngives the light and strange quark masses in lattice units, and the second column, the gauge coupling.\n\"L\" is the spatial size of the lattice. The time size is 64 for the coarse lattices and 96 for the fine\nlattices. u0 is obtained from the average plaquette. The conjugate gradient residual tabulated here\nis the residual used in generating configurations; a smaller residual was used in computing hadron\npropagators. \"\u01eb\" is the time step size in configuration generation. The second to the last column\nis the number of stored lattices, and the last column is the lattice spacing in units of r1 determined\nfrom the static potential in this run. A \"smoothed\" lattice spacing, discussed later, will be used\nto convert results to physical units. The last four lines, with a \u2248 0.09 fm, will be referred to as\n\"fine\" lattices.\n\n5\n\n\fFIG. 1: A \"shape parameter\" for the static potential, r0 /r1 . The red octagons are from coarse\n(a \u2248 0.12 fm) lattices with three degenerate quark flavors, and the red squares from coarse lattices\nwith two light and one strange quark. At (M\u03c0 /M\u03c1 )2 = 0.15 the upper square is from the L = 28\nrun and the lower from the L = 20 run. The blue crosses are from the fine (a \u2248 0.09 fm) runs. The\nsingle green diamond is from a two flavor simulation. The magenta burst is the continuum and\nchiral extrapolation discussed in the text, with the smaller error bar the statistical error and the\nlarger the systematic error. In this figure we have chosen to use (M\u03c0 /M\u03c1 )2 for the abscissa instead\nof the (M\u03c0 r1 )2 used in other figures because this lets us put the entire range of quark masses up\nto the quenched limit (M\u03c0 \u2192 \u221e) in the graph.\n\n6\n\n\famu,d / ams 10/g2 r1 /a (run) r1 /a (smoothed)\n0.0492/0.082 6.503 1.774(10) 1.778\n0.0328/0.082 6.485 1.786(10) 1.788\n0.0164/0.082 6.467 1.783(12) 1.797\n0.0082/0.082 6.458 1.807(10) 1.802\n0.082/0.082\n\n6.561 1.816(10) 1.805\n\n0.0492/0.0492 6.475 1.807(28) 1.766\n0.0328/0.0328 6.470 1.768(30) 1.828\n0.0164/0.0164 6.430 1.796(22) 1.813\n0.0492/0.0492 6.500 1.818(23) 1.821\n0.0492/0.0492 6.450 1.735(30) 1.713\n0.0328/0.0328 6.450 1.757(30) 1.784\n0.0164/0.0164 6.450 1.857(25) 1.858\n0.0082/0.0082 6.420 1.843(20) 1.827\n0.005/0.050\n\n6.76 2.634(13) 2.632\n\n0.007/0.050\n\n6.76 2.644(09) 2.623\n\n0.010/0.050\n\n6.76 2.598(08) 2.610\n\n0.010/0.050\n\n6.76 2.621(09) 2.610\n\n0.020/0.050\n\n6.79 2.649(08) 2.650\n\n0.030/0.050\n\n6.81 2.656(10) 2.662\n\n0.040/0.050\n\n6.83 2.666(11) 2.673\n\n0.050/0.050\n\n6.85 2.679(11) 2.683\n\n0.030/0.030\n\n6.79 2.678(14) 2.650\n\n0.031/0.031\n\n7.18 3.827(12) 3.822\n\n0.0124/0.031 7.11 3.707(13) 3.711\n0.0062/0.031 7.09 3.687(12) 3.684\n\nTABLE II: Smoothed r1 /a compared with r1 /a determined from each run. The top block is from\nlattices with a \u2248 0.18 fm from tuning runs for our high temperature simulations, while the second\nand third blocks are the \"coarse\" and \"fine\" lattices respectively. Five short \"tuning runs\" are\nomitted from this table. Several of the runs have been extended since fitting of the smoothed r1\nwas done.\n\n7\n\n\fWhile we expect r1 /a to be a smooth function of the quark masses and gauge couplings,\nr1 /a determined from fitting the potential in a particular run will have a statistical error, and\nfluctuate from its ideal (infinite statistics) value. To minimize the effects of these run-to-run\nfluctuations, we have fit a smoothed r1 /a for our three flavor lattices with quark masses less\nthan or equal to the strange quark mass. Over the range of masses and gauge couplings we\nhave used, a simple fitting form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u00132\n10\n10\nlog(r1 /a) = C00 + C10\n\u2212 7.0 + C01 (2mu,d + ms ) + C20\n\u2212 7.0\ng2\ng2\n\n(2)\n\ngives an acceptable fit with a \u03c72 of 30.3 with 26 degrees of freedom, with\nC00 = 1.2578(27)\nC10 = 0.9371(93)\nC01 = \u22120.828(29)\nC20 = \u22120.271(22)\n\n(3)\n\nTable II shows values of r1 /a used in the fit together with the smoothed r1 /a for each run.\nWe have used this smoothed r1 /a in converting results from units of the lattice spacing into\nunits of r1 .\nThe shape of the static quark potential is affected by dynamical quarks. One of many\npossible ratios parameterizing this shape is the ratio r0 /r1 . We use the results in Fig. 1 to\nextrapolate r0 /r1 to the physical quark mass and continuum limit. Simultaneously fitting\ncoarse and fine lattice results to a constant plus linear terms in the quark mass and a2 \u03b1s\ngives\nr0 /r1 = 1.476(7) \u2212 0.049(10)(M\u03c0 /M\u03c1 )2 \u2212 0.12(4)(a/r1)2 \u03b1s (a)/\u03b1s (0.12fm) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03c72 = 3.6 for 8 degrees of freedom, using \u03b1s from Ref. [9]. In fitting the potential the\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsame distance range, 2 \u2212 6, was used for all the coarse lattices, and range 5 \u2212 7 for all\nthe fine lattices. Therefore, the statistical error bars in Table II and Fig. 1 appropriately\nrepresent the fluctuations in r1 /a or r0 /r1 within each of these two sets of runs. However,\nthere is a systematic effect from the choice of fit range which is common to all coarse runs and\nall fine runs, but may differ between the two sets. Varying the fitting range over reasonable\n8\n\n\franges suggests that this systematic error can be conservatively estimated as an uncertainty\nof 0.01 in the difference between the coarse and fine lattice r0 /r1 . This leads to a systematic\nuncertainty of about 0.018 in the continuum extrapolation, leading to an estimate\nr0 /r1 = 1.474(7)(18)\n\n(5)\n\nat the physical M\u03c0 /M\u03c1 in the continuum limit.\nTo compute r1 in physical units, we need to set the lattice scale using a directly measurable\nphysical quantity. A convenient choice is the \u03a5 spectrum, in particular the 2S\u20131S and 1P\u2013\n1S splittings. This gives a scale a\u22121 = 1.588(19) GeV on the coarse 0.01/0.05 lattices, and\na\u22121 = 2.271(28) GeV on the fine 0.0062/0.031 lattices [19]. For light quark masses <\n\u223cms /2,\nthe mass dependence of these quantities and of r1 appears to be slight, and we neglect it.\nWith our smoothed values of r1 /a, we then get r1 = 0.324(4) fm on the coarse lattices and\nr1 = 0.320(4) fm on the fine lattices.\nTo extrapolate r1 to the continuum, we first assume that the dominant discretization\nerrors go like \u03b1S a2 . Using \u03b1V (q \u2217 ) [9, 20] (with scale q \u2217 = 3.33/a) for \u03b1S gives a ratio\n(\u03b1S a2 )fine /(\u03b1S a2 )coarse = 0.428. Extrapolating away the discretization errors linearly then\nresults in r1 = 0.317(7) fm in the continuum. However, taste-violating effects, while formally\nO(\u03b1S2 a2 ) and hence subleading, are known to be at least as important as the leading errors\nin some cases. Therefore, one should check if the result changes when the errors are assumed\nto go like \u03b1S2 a2 . Taking \u03b1S = \u03b1V (3.33/a) gives a ratio (\u03b1S2 a2 )fine /(\u03b1S2 a2 )coarse = 0.375; while\na direct lattice measurement of the taste-splittings to be presented in the next section gives\na ratio of 0.35. Extrapolating linearly to the continuum then implies r1 = 0.318(7) fm or\nr1 = 0.319(6) fm respectively, in agreement with the previous result. For our final result,\nwe use an \"average\" ratio of 0.4 and add the effect of varying this ratio in quadrature with\nthe statistical error. We obtain r1 = 0.317(7)(3) fm. The second error is a crude estimate\nof the systematic error from the choice of fit ranges for the static potential.\nA similar calculation to estimate r0 yields 0.471(6) fm on the coarse run and 0.466(6) fm\non the fine run, with a continuum extrapolated value of 0.462(11)(4) fm, where the second\nerror is an estimate of the systematic error from choice of fit ranges in the potential. If we\ntake the above estimate of r0 /r1 and multiply by r1 = 0.317 fm, we obtain instead r0 = 0.467\nfm, and the difference in these two calculations of r0 is another measure of systematic error.\n\n9\n\n\fIV.\n\nLIGHT HADRON MASSES\n\nOur procedures for calculating and fitting hadron propagators are described in Ref. [1].\nWith the exception of the non-Goldstone pions at amu,d = 0.0124, we used Coulomb gauge\nwall sources, with eight source time slices evenly spread through the lattice. Propagators\nwere fit with varying minimum distances, and with the maximum distance either at the midpoint of the lattice or where the fractional statistical errors exceeded 30% for two successive\ntime slices. In most cases, to reduce the effect of autocorrelations, propagators from four\nsuccessive lattices (24 simulation time units) were blocked together before computing the\ncovariance matrix. Masses were selected by looking for a combination of a \"plateau\" in the\nmass as a function of minimum distance and a good confidence level (\u03c72 ) for the fit. We also\nmade an effort to choose minimum distances that are smooth functions of the couplings,\nrecognizing that statistically we should have some fits with low and high confidence levels.\n\nA.\n\nPseudoscalar mesons\n\nWe calculated masses for the exact Goldstone (\u03b35 \u2297 \u03b35 ) pseudoscalar mesons in all of\nthe runs. For the aml/s = 0.0124/0.031 run we calculated the masses of all of the different\ntaste pions, allowing us to see how the taste symmetry breaking decreases with lattice size.\nFigure 2 shows the fitted masses for the pion, the kaon and the \"unmixed ss\u0304\" from the fine\nlattice run with mu,d = 0.2 ms . Table III shows the selected fits for the pseudoscalar meson\nmasses.\nWith Kogut-Susskind quarks there are four \"tastes\" of valence quark, and hence sixteen\ndifferent tastes of pseudoscalar mesons, grouped in eight multiplets. In the continuum limit\nthese are degenerate, and the improved action reduces these splittings relative to the one-link\nfermion action. In our previous work on the coarse lattices we verified that these pion masses\nshow the partial taste symmetry restoration predicted by Lee and Sharpe[21]. In particular,\nwe expect near degeneracy between pairs of pions between which \u03b30 is replaced by \u03b3i , e.g.\ntaste \u03b30 \u03b35 with taste \u03b3i \u03b35 . Also, the squared masses are approximately linear in the quark\nmass, with all tastes having the same slope. This means that a dimensionless measure of\ntaste symmetry breaking, (M\u03c02 \u2212 MG2 ) r12 , is almost independent of the quark mass. Having\nverified these properties on the coarse lattice, we computed non-pointlike pion propagators\n\n10\n\n\frange \u03c72 /D conf.\n\namvalence\n\namsea\n\namP S\n\n0.015 (\u03c0)\n\n\u221e\n\n0.21643(14) 18\u201347 25/28 0.62\n\n0.03 (\u03c0)\n\n\u221e\n\n0.30259(14) 24\u201347 21/22 0.53\n\n0.01 (\u03c0)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.22439(20) 19\u201331 9.1/11 0.61\n\n0.01 (\u03c0)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.22421(12) 19\u201331 4.7/11 0.94\n\n0.007 (\u03c0)\n\n0.007/0.05\n\n0.18881(19) 20\u201331 14/10 0.18\n\n0.005 (\u03c0)\n\n0.005/0.05\n\n0.15970(20) 22\u201331 11/8\n\n0.01/0.05 (K)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.38327(22) 17\u201332 23/14 0.067\n\n0.01/0.05 (K)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.38304(20) 17\u201332 14/13 0.38\n\n0.007/0.05 (K)\n\n0.007/0.05\n\n0.37268(25) 20\u201331 8.6/10 0.57\n\n0.005/0.05 (K)\n\n0.005/0.05\n\n0.36550(29) 20\u201331 6.4/10 0.78\n\n0.05 (ss\u0304)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.49427(18) 17\u201332 19/14 0.18\n\n0.05 (ss\u0304)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.49443(18) 17\u201331 17/13 0.20\n\n0.05 (ss\u0304)\n\n0.007/0.05\n\n0.49317(19) 20\u201331 12/10 0.31\n\n0.05 (ss\u0304)\n\n0.005/0.05\n\n0.49276(23) 20\u201331 5.2/10 0.87\n\n0.031 (\u03c0)\n\n0.031/0.031 0.32003(18) 25\u201347 20/21 0.52\n\n0.0124 (\u03c0)\n\n0.0124/0.031 0.20638(18) 30\u201347 22/16 0.15\n\n0.0062 (\u03c0)\n\n0.0062/0.031 0.14794(19) 35\u201347 7/11\n\n0.19\n\n0.8\n\n0.0124/0.031 (K) 0.0124/0.031 0.27209(18) 30\u201347 23/16 0.11\n0.0062/0.031 (K) 0.0062/0.031 0.25319(19) 30\u201347 14/16 0.61\n0.031 (ss\u0304)\n\n0.0124/0.031 0.32585(17) 27\u201347 29/19 0.07\n\n0.031 (ss\u0304)\n\n0.0062/0.031 0.32727(14) 32\u201347 5.6/14 0.97\n\nTABLE III: Pseudoscalar meson masses. Here we include runs that are new or have been extended\nsince Ref. [1]; results at larger quark masses can be found there. The first column is the valence\nquark mass(es), and the second column the sea quark mass or masses. The particle name is in\nthe first column. Here \"\u03c0\" indicates valence quark mass equal to the lighter dynamical quarks, or\ndegenerate in the quenched case. \"K\" indicates one valence quark equal to the light dynamical\nquarks and one at about ms , while \"ss\u0304\" indicates a fictitious meson with two valence quarks with\nmass about ms , in a flavor nonsinglet state. The remaining columns are the hadron mass, the\ntime range for the chosen fit, \u03c72 and number of degrees of freedom for the fit, and the confidence\nlevel of the fit. The first block is from the quenched run at 10/g 2 = 8.4, the second block from\nthe coarse three flavor runs, and the last block from the fine three flavor runs.

The second and fourth columns\ncontain the masses for the different pions in units of r1 for a coarse and fine lattice run. The coarse\nlattice run (from Ref. [1]) was at 10/g2 = 6.79 and aml/s = 0.02/0.05, and had a lattice spacing\na/r1 = 0.377. The fine lattice run was at 10/g2 = 7.11 and aml/s = 0.0124/0.031, and had a\nlattice spacing a/r1 = 0.269. The physical quark masses are similar, as evidenced by the similar\nGoldstone pion masses. The third and fifth columns are a measure of taste symmetry breaking,\n\u0001\nM\u03c02 \u2212 MG2 r12 , on the coarse and fine lattices, and the final column is the ratio of this measure\n\nbetween the fine and coarse lattice runs.\n\nIn a separate analysis we calculate \"partially quenched\" pseudoscalar masses and decay\nconstants, where the valence quark and sea quarks have different masses[7, 8]. These results have been analyzed using chiral perturbation theory including terms parameterizing\nthe taste symmetry breaking[22]. From this analysis we find f\u03c0 and fK at the physical\nquark masses, and values for several of the low energy constants in chiral perturbation\ntheory. Another product of the computations of mP S and fP S is a determination of the\nlattice quark masses corresponding to the real world. We define the strange and light quark\nlat\nmasses at fixed lattice spacing, amlat\ns and amu,d , to be the lattice masses that give the exlat\nperimental values for MK and M\u03c0 . To determine amlat\ns and amu,d , we fit the mass and\n\n13\n\n\fdecay constant data to chiral log forms that take into account staggered taste violations\n+18\n+6\nlat\n[22]. We find amlat\ns = 0.0390(1)(\u221220 ), amu,d = 0.00148(1)(\u22128 ) on the coarse lattices, and\n+12\nlat\namlat\ns = 0.0272(1)(\u221210 ), amu,d = 0.00103(0)(4) on the fine lattices, where the errors are sta-\n\ntistical and systematic. The systematic error is dominated by that coming from the chiral\nextrapolation/interpolation and the \u223c 2% scale uncertainty.\nWe have also calculated masses of excited pseudoscalar mesons. Because this requires\nconsideration of two-meson states, discussion of this is deferred to a later section on hadronic\ndecays and excited states.\n\nB.\n\nVector mesons\n\nFigure 3 shows vector meson masses versus minimum distance fit for the fine lattice run\nwith the lightest quark mass. Mass estimates for all of the runs are in Table V. Note\nthat despite our relatively small quark masses, none of these vector mesons are below the\nthreshold for decay into two pseudoscalars, since the angular momentum of the vector mesons\nrequires that the vector meson at rest decay into pseudoscalars with momentum 2\u03c0/L. In\naddition, we require a combination of tastes in the pseudoscalars that overlaps with the\ntaste of the vector meson - the vector mesons tabulated here have spin \u2297 taste = \u03b3i \u2297 \u03b3i .\n\nTable VI shows masses for 1+ mesons. These mesons can decay into a vector and a\n\npseudoscalar meson, and these simulations reach into the quark mass region where this\nthreshold is crossed. We defer discussion of this effect to the next section.\n\nC.\n\nBaryons\n\nTable VII contains masses for the octet nucleon and \u039e. We do not tabulate the \u039b and \u03a3\nsince our code does not cleanly separate the light quark isospins. In principle, the nucleon\nmass could be fit by methods similar to those used for the pion mass and decay constant,\nincorporating effects of continuum chiral corrections, lattice artifacts like taste symmetry\nbreaking, finite size effects and partial quenching. Such an analysis is not yet available.\nHowever, statistical errors on the nucleon mass are much larger than for the pseudoscalars,\nso this full machinery may be less important here. An alternative strategy for dealing\nwith lattice artifacts is to perform a continuum extrapolation at the quark masses used\n\n14\n\n\frange \u03c72 /D conf.\n\namvalence\n\namsea\n\namV\n\n0.015 (\u03c1)\n\n\u221e\n\n0.4660(30) 11\u201325 4/11\n\n0.03 (\u03c1)\n\n\u221e\n\n0.4992(15) 5\u201325 18/15 0.28\n\n0.01 (\u03c1)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.5690(50) 6\u201322 15/13 0.32\n\n0.01 (\u03c1)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.5680(30) 6\u201319 10/10 0.42\n\n0.007 (\u03c1)\n\n0.007/0.05\n\n0.5510(40) 6\u201318 11/9\n\n0.005 (\u03c1)\n\n0.005/0.05\n\n0.5340(80) 6\u201315 5.8/6 0.44\n\n0.01/0.05 (K \u2217 )\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.6492(25) 8\u201323 5.2/12 0.95\n\n0.01/0.05 (K \u2217 )\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.6462(18) 8\u201327 29/16 0.023\n\n0.007/0.05 (K \u2217 )\n\n0.007/0.05\n\n0.6330(30) 9\u201323 10/11 0.54\n\n0.005/0.05 (K \u2217 )\n\n0.005/0.05\n\n0.6190(40) 10\u201323 15/10 0.12\n\n0.05 (\u03c6)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.7193(14) 9\u201330 11/18 0.90\n\n0.05 (\u03c6)\n\n0.01/0.05\n\n0.7194(11) 9\u201331 15/19 0.74\n\n0.05 (\u03c6)\n\n0.007/0.05\n\n0.7114(16) 12\u201330 12/15 0.69\n\n0.05 (\u03c6)\n\n0.005/0.05\n\n0.7140(30) 14\u201329 15/12 0.25\n\n0.031 (\u03c1)\n\n0.031/0.031 0.4781(14) 16\u201342 36/23 0.043\n\n0.0124 (\u03c1)\n\n0.0124/0.031 0.4173(13) 10\u201333 31/20 0.059\n\n0.0062 (\u03c1)\n\n0.0062/0.031 0.3895(28) 10\u201327 11/14 0.65\n\n0.97\n\n0.26\n\n0.0124/0.031 (K \u2217 ) 0.0124/0.031 0.4483(18) 15\u201342 42/24 0.013\n0.0062/0.031 (K \u2217 ) 0.0062/0.031 0.4350(11) 10\u201334 13/21 0.91\n0.031 (\u03c6)\n\n0.0124/0.031 0.4831(8) 14\u201347 55/30 0.0032\n\n0.031 (\u03c6)\n\n0.0062/0.031 0.4810(40) 25\u201345 18/17 0.39\n\nTABLE V: Vector meson masses.

In general, we have used single precision for the computations\nat each lattice site, with global sums in double precision. At our smallest quark mass,\namu,d = 0.005, we have tested the accuracy of our hadron spectrum and static potential\ncomputations by repeating the computation in double precision on a subset of the lattices.\n18\n\n\fFIG. 4:\n\nNucleon masses. The blue diamonds and octagons are quenched coarse and fine runs\n\nrespectively. The red squares are three flavor coarse lattice results, and the red bursts the three\nflavor fine lattices. The magenta fancy plusses connected by the straight line and the two curved\nlines are continuum and chiral extrapolations discussed in the text. The fancy diamond is the\nexperimental value, with an error bar from the uncertainty in r1 .\n\nTable VIII shows results for a number of quantities evaluated on a set of 137 lattices with\naml/s = 0.005/0.050. Note that since these are fit on exactly the same sets of lattices\nwith exactly the same programs, any discrepancies are the result of the different precision.\nHowever, we provide statistical errors to show how the effects of roundoff compare with the\n\n19\n\n\fstatistical errors. For all of these quantities the effects of using single precision are small\ncompared with the statistical errors, and with the statistical errors we would get from any\nreasonable lengthening of this run.\nQuantity Double\n\nSingle\n\nComment\n\nV (2, 0, 0) 0.829883(852) 0.829888(853) potential at r=(2,0,0)\nV (2, 2, 2) 1.05426(503) 1.05451(502)\nV (3, 3, 3) 1.2511(194)\n\n1.2511(194)\n\nr1 /a\n\n2.63933(1679) 2.63915(1678) t=4\u20135, block=5\n\nr0 /r1\n\n1.4566(64)\n\n1.4566(64)\n\nt=4\u20135, block=5\n\n\u03c0(20)\n\n411.53(1.55)\n\n411.44(1.55)\n\nprop. at d=20\n\n\u03c1(6)\n\n143.76(1.78)\n\n143.73(1.78)\n\naM\u03c0\n\n0.15965(22)\n\n0.15966(21)\n\nd=20\u201331, \u03c72 /D = 0.60\n\naMK\n\n0.36519(34)\n\n0.36519(34)\n\nd=20\u201332, \u03c72 /D = 0.82\n\naM\u03c1\n\n0.5330(83)\n\n0.5330(83)\n\nd=6\u201314, \u03c72 /D = 0.85\n\naMN\n\n0.7311(84)\n\n0.7312(84)\n\nd=6\u201314, \u03c72 /D = 0.50\n\nTABLE VIII: Comparison of results with single and double precision computations. The first three\nlines are the static quark potential at three different spatial separations. These separations are in\nthe spatial region used in fitting the potential. The next two lines are parameters extracted from\nfitting the potential, the inverse lattice spacing in units of r1 and a \"shape parameter\" r0 /r1 . The\nsecond part of the table contains hadron propagator comparisons. The \u03c0(20) and \u03c1(6) show the\npion and rho propagators summed over a time slice at time separations 20 and 6. These distances\nare near the minimum of the range used in fitting the masses, and so are among the most important\ndistances in our fits. Finally, the last four lines are hadron masses computed from the double and\nsingle precision propagators.\n\nB.\n\nIntegration step size\n\nOur simulation algorithm is expected to introduce errors proportional to \u01eb2 where \u01eb is\nthe simulation time step size. Based on previous experience and our expectations about the\nscaling of the fermion force with the quark mass, we have used a step size of about 2/3 of\n20\n\n\fthe light quark mass in these runs. As a check on these effects, we have made short runs\nwith larger step sizes at one of our small quark masses (the same parameters at which we\nchecked effects of the spatial size of the lattice.) The production runs here were done at a\nstep size of \u01eb = 0.0067 (658 lattices), and the short tests at step sizes of 0.01 (49 lattices)\nand 0.01333 (53 lattices) with lattice size 203 \u00d7 64. Table IX shows results for the static\nquark potential and some hadron masses at these different step sizes, using the same fitting\nranges in each case. Since the short runs were too short for a good error analysis, statistical\nerrors on these quantities are estimated by scaling the errors on the L = 20, \u01eb = 0.0067 run\nby the square root of the ratio of the numbers of configurations used.\nL = 20\n\nL = 28\n\nL = 20\n\nL = 20\n\nQ.\n\n\u01eb = 0.0067 \u01eb = 0.0067 \u01eb = 0.0100 \u01eb = 0.013\n\n\u0003\n\n1.70092(2) 1.70094(3) 1.70096(7) 1.70066(7)\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8\n\n0.07421(10) 0.07420(13) 0.07374(37) 0.07488(35)\n\nr1 /a 2.598(8)\n\n2.621(9)\n\n2.649(29)\n\n2.619(28)\n\naM\u03c0 0.22439(20) 0.22421(12) 0.22500(73) 0.22554(70)\naM\u03c1 0.569(5)\n\n0.568(3)\n\n0.557(18)\n\n0.558(18)\n\naMN 0.771(4)\n\n0.767(3)\n\n0.785(15)\n\n0.753(14)\n\nTABLE IX: Effect of integration step size.

Columns two and three are our long runs with L = 20 and 28 using a step size of 0.0067.\n(Our usual practice is to use a step size about 2/3 of the lightest quark mass.) Columns four and\nfive are from short runs with step sizes 0.01 and 0.01333.\n\nC.\n\nSpatial size of the lattice\n\nIn one of our coarse lattice runs, 10/g 2 = 6.76, aml/s = 0.01/0.05, we have made a second\nrun at a larger spatial lattice size, 283 \u00d7 64. (We have also lengthened the run with L = 20,\nso this is the run where we have the best statistics.) This allows us to explicitly check the\neffects of the spatial lattice size. Table X shows the results of this test for the static quark\npotential and simple hadron propagators. Note that these values of r1 /a fall on opposite\nsides of the interpolated (\"smoothed r1 \") value of 2.610, and the values of r0 /r1 fall on\n21\n\n\fopposite sides of a straight line fit to the coarse lattice points in Fig. 1, leading us to believe\nthat we do not see any statistically significant finite size effects in either the potential or\nthe hadron masses. The sizes of these two lattices in physical units are 2.43 and 3.40 fm,\nusing r1 = 0.317 fm to set the scale, and M\u03c0 L is 4.48 and 6.27 respectively. Using the\n(staggered) chiral fits [7, 8] to light pseudoscalar masses and decay constants, it is possible\nto estimate the leading finite volume correction on M\u03c0 .

These are from the runs with 10/g 2 =\n6.76 and aml/s = 0.01/0.05. The spatial sizes were L = 20 and 28, corresponding to physical\nsizes of 2.4 and 3.4 fm, using r1 = 0.317 fm to set the physical scale. The first two lines are\nparameters extracted from fitting the potential, the inverse lattice spacing in units of r1 and a\n\"shape parameter\" r0 /r1 . The second part of the table contains hadron mass comparisons. \u2206 is\nthe L = 20 value minus the L = 28 value in each row.\n\nD.\n\nAutocorrelations\n\nBecause of the high cost of generating sample configurations with dynamical quarks, successive samples were taken at simulation time intervals such that they are not completely\nstatistically independent. The resulting autocorrelations (in simulation time) affect the statistical errors on all of the computed quantities. The \"exponential autocorrelation time\",\nwhich is determined by the eigenvalue of the Markov process matrix which is closest to one, is\nexpected to be the same for all calculated quantities. However, the contribution of this slowest mode to various quantities varies, and to parameterize the effect of autocorrelations on\n22\n\n\findividual quantities we use the \"integrated autocorrelation time\", \u03c4int =\n\nP\n\ns\n\nCQ (s), where\n\ns runs over the simulation time separations and CQ (s) is the normalized autocorrelation for\nquantity Q,\nCQ (s) =\n\nhQ(t + s)Q(t)i \u2212 hQi2\nhQ(t)Q(t)i \u2212 hQi2\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nBecause we need a covariance matrix to calculate masses from the average propagators, and\ngetting a nonsingular covariance matrix requires more samples than there are points in the fit\nrange, we cannot get a hadron mass from one sample. So, to study autocorrelations of hadron\nmass estimates we use the \"mirror image\" of this procedure - we do single elimination\njackknife fits with one sample omitted from the data set and compute the autocorrelations of\nthese jackknife fits. Figure 5 shows the jackknife pion masses as a function of the simulation\ntime of the omitted sample for the run with 10/g 2 = 6.76 and aml/s = 0.01/0.05. For\nexample, Table XI shows CQ (6) where Q is the \u03c0, \u03c1 or nucleon mass or the amplitude in the\npion propagator, and the simulation time separation is six units, corresponding to successive\nstored lattices. From this table we can see that the normalized autocorrelation is largest\nfor the pion mass, and has no obvious systematic dependence on the light quark mass.\nTherefore, we average the autocorrelations over the quark masses, separately for the coarse\nand fine runs. The resulting autocorrelations as a function of simulation time separation are\nplotted in Fig. 6.\nNot surprisingly, the autocorrelation times are larger on the fine lattices than on the\ncoarse lattices. In Ref. [11] autocorrelations of the topological charge were computed on these\nlattices. The topological charge evolves more slowly than the hadron masses, with estimated\nautocorrelation times as large as 35 time units for the 10/g 2 = 7.18, aml/s = 0.031/0.031\nrun. We refer the reader to [11] for more discussion.\n\nVI.\n\nHADRONIC DECAYS AND EXCITED STATES\n\nWhen the quark mass is small enough, most of the hadrons we study are unstable,\ndecaying strongly into two or more lighter hadrons. In principle, although not always in\npractice, fitting to the ground state mass in our propagators will give the mass of the\nlightest state with the right quantum numbers in the periodic box, which in many cases will\nbe a two particle state. In Ref. [1] we showed this effect in the 0++ (a0 ) channel.

The third column is the number of samples in each run. We also show the results\naveraged over all the coarse runs, and over all the fine runs, where the third column is the total\nnumber of coarse or fine lattices.\n\nresults on the fine lattices. For the three flavor runs, the fine lattice points agree well with\nthe coarse lattice results. The figure also shows the mass of the lowest energy two-meson\nstate expected to couple to this particle, \u03c0 + \u03b7. Surprisingly, the new points at the lighest\nquark masses increasingly deviate from this two-meson mass, which is not understood. The\nlight mass quenched propagators remain difficult to fit, which may not be surprising for\nunstable particles in an unphysical theory. We have not yet tried fitting to the particle-plusghost form suggested by Bardeen et al. [25]. For quark masses where the two-meson state\nhas lower energy, it would be satisfying to find a one meson (a0 ) state as an excited state in\nthe propagator. Our attempts to do this have been unsuccessful so far. In the fine lattice\nrun at aml/s = 0.0062/0.031 we were able to extract an excited state mass, shown as the\ncyan decorated square in Fig. 7. However, the mass of this state is still much smaller than\nthe extrapolations from large quark mass, and it is likely also a two-meson state, perhaps\nK K\u0304.\nWe also expect to see the pseudovector (1+ ) mesons couple to two zero-momentum\n24\n\n\fFIG. 5:\n\nSingle elimination jackknife masses for the pion, from the run with 10/g 2 = 6.76 and\n\naml/s = 0.01/0.05, using fits with Dmin = 19.\n\nmesons, although for these mesons we are not as far below the threshold as in the 0++\ncase. Figure 8 shows 1+\u2212 (b1 ) masses as a function of quark mass along with the decay\nchannel mass M\u03c1 + M\u03c0 . We tentatively attribute the downturn at the lightest quark masses\nto this decay, although better statistics at the lightest coarse lattice and a lighter mass fine\nlattice run would clarify the situation. Again, we are unable to get good fits for the lightest\nmass quenched propagators.\nKogut-Susskind meson propagators generally include normal exponential contributions\nfrom one J P C value and an oscillating exponential component from a parity partner state.\nIn the case of the Goldstone pion, the parity partner has the exotic J P C = 0+\u2212 and thus\ndoes not contribute to the propagator. In combination with a relatively high signal-to-noise\nratio at all time separations, this enhances our ability to determine the 0\u2212+ contributions.\nSpecifically, in addition to the one-state fits, which we presented in Figure 2 and Table III,\nwhen we performed a two-state fit of the pseudoscalar propagator data, we were able to\ndetermine the mass of a second, excited 0\u2212+ state. We have presented preliminary results\nof this analysis in [26]. We fit 0\u2212+ propagators to the form:\nC(t) = A0 (e\u2212M0 t + e\u2212M0 (T \u2212t) ) + A1 (e\u2212M1 t + e\u2212M1 (T \u2212t) ),\n25\n\n(7)\n\n\fFIG. 6: Normalized autocorrelations for the \u03c0, \u03c1 and nucleon masses and the amplitude of the\npion propagator as functions of the separation in simulation time.

Figure 9 is a sample pion fit plot showing the fitted\nvalues of aM0 and aM1 as a function of the minimum time separation, Dmin , included\nin the fits. By comparing to one-state fits shown in Figure 2, note the inclusion of an\nexcited state in the fitting function allows high-confidence fits to extend down to a Dmin\nof 2 or 3, as might be expected.

As the statistical errors on the excited pion mass fits are large compared\nwith the differences between the coarse and fine lattice fits, we considered all of the mass fits\ntogether in the linear fit. Extrapolating the resulting linear function to the physical value of\n(M\u03c0 r1 )2 = 0.050, we get a prediction of a physical 0\u2212+ excited state at 1362(41)(247)MeV,\n\n28\n\n\fFIG. 9:\n\nFit plot showing ground state and excited state masses of Goldstone pion 0\u2212+ as a\n\nfunction of Dmin , the minimum distance included in the fit.

The symbol size is proportional to confidence\nlevel.\n\nwhich agrees within the large errors with the mass of the \u03c0(1300) state. The first error is\nstatistical. The second is the systematic error predominantly due to contributions to the\npropagator which are unaccounted for in the form of the fitting function. We estimate this\nby examining the fit plots and estimating the range of mass values one might reasonably\nchoose, that is, this error reflects the stability of the fitted value under variation of the fit\n\n29\n\n\fFIG. 10: Ground state and excited state 0\u2212+ masses as a function of (M\u03c0 r1 )2 . In the legend, the\nsymbol on the left represents fine lattice results, and that on the right the coarse lattice results.\n\nrange, e.g., the difference between the Dmin = 3 and Dmin = 4 points in Figure 9 and is\nreflected in Figures 10 and 14 as light cyan error bars on the excited states. We linearly\nextrapolate the individual systematic errors to (M\u03c0 r1 )2 = 0.05. Systematic errors due to\nchiral extrapolation, finite lattice size and lattice spacing, are small relative to the statistical\nerror and the systematic error from additional states.\nSimilarly, an excited state is evident in the 0\u2212+ ss propagator. The analysis of states containing strange quarks is complicated by the fact that our simulated strange quark masses,\n\n30\n\n\fams = 0.050, 0.031 differ from the physical strange quark mass, am\u2217s = 0.039, 0.027 (for the\ncoarse and fine lattices respectively) as discussed in subsection IV A. To correct for this,\nafter fitting to the form of Eq. (7), we interpolated the meson masses to the correct physical\nvalues of the strange quark mass, m\u2217s , using\nMPS (m\u2217s ) = MPS (ms ) \u2212 (ms \u2212 m\u2217s )\n\nMPS (ms ) \u2212 MPS (mu,d )\n,\nms \u2212 mu,d\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we use the mass of the excited 0\u2212+ state at the simulation value of ms for MPS (ms ),\nand the pion excited state on the same lattices for MPS (mu,d ). We cannot interpolate masses\nfrom lattices with three flavors of degenerate quarks in this manner, so we eliminate them\nfrom this analysis.\nThe interpolated excited state masses fit a linear function of (M\u03c0 r1 )2 and we again extrapolated the resulting form to the physical (M\u03c0 r1 )2 . The result is Mss = 1645(40)(145)\nfor the excited ss psuedoscalar state.\nWe have no pure ss physical 0\u2212+ with which to compare ground state fits. We can, however, compare the extrapolation of the corrected excited state masses with the experimental\nmass of the \u03b7(1440), which one expects to be dominated by the ss contribution. This is\nconsistent with our result with the large systematic error. We display all of the pion and\n(corrected) 0\u2212+ ss fits in Figure 10, with physical states for comparison.\nEven more interesting is the kaon propagator. Formed of a light quark and a strange\nquark, the kaon, J P = 0\u2212 , has no definite charge-conjugation quantum number when mu,d 6=\n\nms . Consequently, it has a non-exotic parity partner with J P = 0+ , and the propagator\nhas a tiny, but significant oscillating component. On theses lattices the amplitude of the\noscillating state is significantly smaller than that of the kaon ground state, and the mass\nis greater than that of the kaon ground state, thus it does not interfere with with singleexponential fits of the propagator at large time separations (Dmin > 14). Two-state fits to\nthe form of Eq. (7) fail at all time separations because the 0+ mass falls below that of the\nfirst excited 0\u2212 state. Figure 11 shows an attempt to fit the 10/g 2 = 7.09, amu,d = 0.0062,\nams = 0.031 fine lattice propagator to two non-oscillating exponentials, as in Eq. (7). All\nfits are of extremely low confidence levels and there is no evident plateau for the excited\nstate. Figure 12 shows fits of the same propagator to a three-state form,\nC(t) = A0 (e\u2212M0 t + e\u2212M0 (T \u2212t) ) + A1 (e\u2212M1 t + e\u2212M1 (T \u2212t) ) + A2 (\u22121)t (e\u2212M2 t + e\u2212M2 (T \u2212t) ), (9)\n31\n\n\fwith high confidence levels and masses of consistent value through a large variation in the\nlower limit of the fit range, Dmin .\nPropagators from both fine lattice sets with mu,d 6= ms were inconsistent with double\nexponential forms, (Eq. 7), but fit to triple exponentials, (Eq. 9) with high confidence. The\nsame was true of the coarse lattice sets with amu,d \u2264 0.02. In general, we find that as\nmu,d \u2212\u2192 ms , the amplitude of the oscillating state becomes indistinguishable from zero,\npresumably because charge conjugation regains its status as a good quantum number. In\nthe fits to kaon propagators from the coarse lattice set with 10/g 2 = 6.79, amu,d = 0.030\nwe were no longer able to distinguish the amplitude of any oscillating state from noise.\nConfidence levels for both two-state and three-state fits were a few tenths of a percent, yet\nwe could discern equivalent plateaus for the excited 0\u2212 state mass as a function of Dmin in\neach case. Attempts to read a plateau for the oscillating state were unconvincing. For the\ncoarse lattices with 10/g 2 = 6.81, amu,d = 0.040, and both coarse and fine lattices with three\ndegenerate flavors of quarks, two state fits resolved the excited state with high confidence\n(as we have mentioned before when we considered these very same fits as limiting cases of\nboth pions and 0\u2212+ ss mesons.)\nThe oscillating scalar state is far lighter than the lightest strange 0+ meson, the K0\u2217 (1430).\nIt does, however, agree well with the sum of the masses of the dominant K0\u2217 (1430) decay\nmode products, K + \u03c0, on every lattice set for which it was measured. Resolution of the\nK0\u2217 (1430) \u2192 K + \u03c0 decay channel is additional evidence that our simulations with light\ndynamical quarks correctly reproduce the expected complexities of the physical world. When\nwe perform similar fits to quenched kaon propagators we can find no evidence of an oscillating\n0+ state, even with widely separated valence quark masses, such as aml/s = 0.0062/0.031.\nFurthermore, with the quenched kaon propagators, it is simple to extract the contribution\nof the first excited 0\u2212 state, see for example Fig. 13.\nWe have also performed an extrapolation of the excited kaon state masses to the physical\nvalue of (M\u03c0 r1 )2 = 0.050. Again considering the fine and coarse lattice data together the\nexcited states fit, with 8% confidence level, to a line which intercepts (M\u03c0 r1 )2 = 0.050 at\n1527(46)(68)MeV. This is in decent agreement with the K(1460) state and inconsistent with\nthe K(1460)'s expected decay products, \u03c0\u03c0K, which should be at about 775 MeV. This\nlends credence to the belief that the K(1460) is a true mesonic state.\nFigure 14 summarizes the fits to the kaon propagators. As with the ss states, we have\n32\n\n\fcorrected the ground state and excited state mass fits for the difference between the simulated\nstrange quark mass and the physical strange quark mass using the interpolation expression\n(8). Since we have measured a 0+ state at only one value of the strange quark mass for each\nlattice spacing, interpolation of the 0+ state is not possible. We include the pion ground state\nand the sum of the pion and (uncorrected) kaon ground state masses for comparison. We\ninclude isospin-averaged physical states for comparison.

In principle, the extrapolation to zero\nlattice spacing is straightforward - we expect errors proportional to a2 g 2 . Extrapolation to\n36\n\n\fFIG. 14: Summary of fits of kaon propagators. Ground state and excited state kaon masses are\ninterpolated to the correct strange quark mass. 0+ parity partner state and \u03c0 + K masses are\nuncorrected for comparison. For the Ks, \u03c0 and 0+ entries in the legend, the symbol on the left\nrepresents fine lattice results, and that on the right the coarse lattice results.\n\nthe physical light quark mass is more difficult. First, most of the hadrons decay strongly, and\nas we have seen for the 0++ , and the 0+ for nondegenerate quarks, simulations with light sea\nquark masses show the couplings to the decay channels. For stable hadrons the extrapolation\nto physical light quark mass involves chiral logarithms. Because of the remaining breaking\nof taste symmetry, fitting to the chiral logarithms requires that the continuum extrapolation\n\n37\n\n\fbe done first, or simultaneously.\nIn the case of the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants, taste violations have been\nincluded in the chiral perturbation theory, which makes possible a simultaneous extrapolation in lattice spacing and quark masses[7, 8]. The small statistical errors on pseudoscalar\nmasses and decay constants make this rather involved analysis necessary, but also make it\npossible. Work towards comparable extrapolations for some other quantities, such as the\nnucleon mass, is in progress.\nIn the meantime, it is interesting to use a less sophisticated extrapolation to see how\nthese lattice results compare with the real world. Figure 16 shows such a comparison, using\na linear or quadratic extrapolation in the light quark mass and linear extrapolation in the\nsquared lattice spacing. Since the difference between the strange quark mass used in our\nsimulations and the correct value is roughly twice as large in the coarse runs as in the\nfine runs, the extrapolation in lattice spacing also largely corrects for the too-large strange\nquark mass used in the runs. (It is not entirely an accident that the continuum extrapolation\nlargely takes care of adjusting the strange quark mass, since one of the largest reasons for\nthe error in adjusting the strange quark mass was the neglect of order a2 corrections in\ntuning the strange quark mass.) Note that the lattice nucleon mass plotted here is the\nlinear extrapolation shown in Fig. 4; a proper chiral extrapolation is expected to lower this\nvalue.\nThe spectrum results from these simulations with three dynamical light flavors are encouraging. Clearly, however, considerably more work is needed, in particular on chiral extrapolations, before we can be confident that the calculations can produce accurate and precise\nresults in all the channels that we have examined. Runs are continuing for mu,d = 0.1ms on\nboth coarse and fine lattices.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nComputations for this work were performed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), the National\nEnergy Resources Supercomputer Center (NERSC), the Albuquerque High Performance\nComputing Center, Indiana University, and the University of Arizona.
