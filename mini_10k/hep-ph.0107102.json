There is an unimpeachable reason to visit the Sistine Chapel,\nnamely to see Michelangelo's frescoes. For me they realize the power of\nbeauty. Most of you who have been in the Sistine chapel will have forgotten \u2013 or maybe never have noticed in the first place \u2013 that halfway up the\nsidewalls there are wonderful frescoes by other famous masters, namely Botticelli, Perugino and others. They are not quite on the same unique level of\nMichelangelo's frescoes, yet had they been at almost any other place in the\nworld, people would undertake pilgrimages to see just them!\nNow I can state my analogy: I concede that the fascination of charm\ndecays might not match that of beauty (or of strange) decays anymore than\nBotticelli can match the power of Michelangelo (or Rafaello)! Of course,\nBotticelli is still Botticelli, i.e. a first-rate artist, but what about charm?\nAfter all, the weak phenomenology that the Standard Model (SM) predicts\nfor charm is on the dull side. I will argue that future charm studies can\nprovide us with first rate lessons on fundamental dynamics taking my cue\nfrom the two items italized in the previous sentence:\n\u2022 With the weak dynamics expected to be well known, detailed charm\nstudies provide us with a test bed for theoretical QCD technologies.\n\u2022 Since features specific to the SM make the weak phenomenology dull,\ncharm transitions allow a novel access to the flavour problem with most\n\u2013 though not all \u2013 experimental conditions being a priori favourable!\nAccordingly my talk will focus on two topics: (A) Heavy quark expansions\nand quark-hadron duality at the charm scale with a discussion of D 0 \u2212 D\u0304 0 oscillations and (B) Charm's promise of revealing New Physics mainly through\nstudies of CP violation.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nQCD Technologies\n\nWhile we have no solution of full QCD, we do have theoretical technologies inferred from QCD for special situations that allow us to deal with\nnonperturbative dynamics in an internally consistent way. Those are chiral\nperturbation theory for pion and kaon dynamics and heavy quark expansions (HQE). The latter apply to various aspects of the dynamics of beauty\nhadrons and possibly of charm hadrons as well. However since the charm\nquark mass exceeds ordinary hadronic scales by a moderate margin only, one\ncan expect at best a semi-quantitative description there.\nSimulating QCD on the lattice represents a technology of wide reach.\nIn principle lattice QCD could work its way up to the charm scale from\nbelow. However the considerable advances achieved recently on the lattice\nwith respect to heavy flavour physics were not based on such a 'brute-force'\napproach, but on a judicious use of 1/mQ expansions [1].\nQuark models are still very useful \u2013 if proper judgement is used. Subtle,\nyet relevant field theoretic features of QCD entering in the operator product expansion (OPE) like scale dependance are often not realized in quark\nmodels, unlike in HQE.\n\n2.1\n\nHeavy Quark Expansions\n\nIn HQE one describes an observable \u03b3 for a hadron HQ \u2013 be it a total rate or\na distribution \u2013 through an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark\nmass obtained through an operator product expansion (OPE) [2] constructed\nat small Euclidean space-time intervals mQ :\n\u03b3(E) =\n\nX\n\nci (\u03b1S , E)(\u039bi /mQ )i ;\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nE denotes the relevant energy scale. Dispersion relations that have to be exact as long as QCD does not generate unphysical singularities in the complex\nplane connect the coefficients of the OPE with moments of the observable\ndistributions in Minkowski space. This is expressed through sum rules [3, 4],\nwhich can generically be expressed by\nZ\n\ndEw(E)\u03b3(E)|hadrons =\n\n3\n\nZ\n\ndEw(E)\u03b3(E)|quarks\n\n(2)\n\n\fstating that the integral of such observable \u03b3 weighted by some function\nw(E) has to be equal when expressed in terms of hadronic or quark degrees\nof freedom. This is referred to as (global) quark-hadron duality or duality\nfor short.\nSuch methods are applied to inclusive transitions \u2013 lifetimes, semileptonic branching ratios, lepton spectra etc. \u2013 and exclusive observables like\nsemileptonic form factors.\nQuark models are still the best we have for treating nonleptonic twobody modes of charm mesons. I understand there are several reasons why\nthe recently suggested methods for B \u2192 M1 M2 [5] are hard to justify for\ncharm decays; one is that nonleading corrections \u223c O(1/mQ ) cannot be\ntreated (yet). Nevertheless one should try them there anyway!\n\n2.2\n\nApplications: Lifetimes\n\nThe HQE yields a more successful description of the pattern in the weak\nlifetimes of charm hadrons than could a priori be expected, in particular\nsince those lifetimes differ by more than an order of magnitude between\n\u03c4 (D + ) being the longest and \u03c4 (\u03a9c ) the shortest. Since no new data on\nlifetimes were presented at this meeting, let me just make a few comments\nhere; my more detailed evaluation can be found in [6]:\n\u2022 The HQE provides an after-the-fact rationale for most phenomenological concepts like Pauli Interference, Weak Annihilation (WA) etc. as\nO(1/m3c ) effects.\n\u2022 It makes more definitive statements about the weight of those concepts.\nFor example, WA has to be a nonleading effect in meson decays, although it\ncould still be quite significant.\n\u2022 An important quantity is the ratio \u03c4 (Ds )/\u03c4 (D 0 ). Its first measurement\nby E 687, the precursor of FOCUS, gave the first experimental confirmation\nthat WA is indeed not a leading mechanism for generating the D + -D 0 lifetime\ndifference. It also provided clear evidence that the Ds lifetime exceeds that of\nD 0 by a moderate amount. A new round of very high statistics experiments\nhas begun. The world average from last summer reads [7]\n\u03c4 (Ds )/\u03c4 (D 0 ) = 1.18 \u00b1 0.02\n\n(3)\n\nrather than the previous world average of 1.125 \u00b1 0.042. A new SELEX\nnumber is a bit lower: \u03c4 (Ds )/\u03c4 (D 0 ) = 1.145\u00b10.049; new measurements from\n4\n\n\fFOCUS and the beauty factories will be added soon. Anticipating the new\nworld average to settle in around 1.2, it confirms that WA is not the leading\nsource of lifetimes differences among charm mesons; at the same time it\nshows WA to be still significant at the about 20 % level, as expected [8]. The\napparent fact that due to WA 10 - 20 % of all Ds decays are interfered away\nshould leave some clear footprints in certain classes of exclusive channels.\nThis could be studied, e.g., by comparing Dalitz plots of Cabibbo suppressed\nD 0 and D + modes with Cabibbo allowed Ds channels.\n\u2022 In contrast to quark model treatments the HQE allow to understand\nthe absolute D 0 and D + semileptonic branching ratios as due to 1/m2c effects.\n\u2022 Predictions on baryon lifetimes involve quark model estimates of various\nexpectation values and thus are subject to large theoretical uncertainties.\n0\n\u2022 We need \u223c 10 % measurements of both \u039e+\nc and \u039ec lifetimes. They\ncould easily reveal systematic problems in the HQE predictions and have a\nsignificant impact on our understanding of beauty baryon lifetimes.\n\u2022 The ratios of semileptonic branching ratios for baryons do not reflect\ntheir lifetime ratios!\n\n2.3\n\nTheoretical uncertainties\n\nSince no clear evidence for New Physics has been found yet in charm transitions (see the discussion below), it would be tempting to declare victory and\nmove on to presumably greener pastures. I want to list three reasons why\ncharm physics still merits our dedicated attention:\n\u2022 It can still provide us with new insights into the inner workings of QCD.\n\u2022 It allows us to calibrate the theoretical tools we are using in extracting CKM parameters in B decays: measuring both decay constants\nfD and fDs accurately and comparing them with unquenched lattice\nresults will enable us to predict fB with more confidence; likewise a\nprecise extraction of the form factors in D \u2192 l\u03bdK/K \u2217 /\u03c0/\u03c1 and their\nq 2 dependance will be of direct as well as indirect help in extracting\n|V (ub)| from B \u2192 l\u03bd\u03c1/\u03c0.\n\u2022 The third motivation is not obvious: the relevant scale for the nonperturbative dynamics in exclusive b \u2192 c modes is given by the charm\n\n5\n\n\fmass. In particular in B \u2192 l\u03bdD \u2217 the most relevant preasymptotic effects are given by the expansion in 1/mc rather than 1/mb . Also the\nD \u2217 width has an impact on the accuracy with which the formfactor\nfor B \u2192 D \u2217 even at zero recoil can be predicted. A comprehensive\nanalysis of charm decays can shed light on such dynamics.\nThe central issue here is that of theoretical uncertainties. They are fed from\nsome obvious sources \u2013 namely numerical uncertainties in input parameters\nlike \u03b1S \u2013 and not so straightforward ones reflecting more systematic uncertainties. Limitations to duality belong to the latter [9, 4].\nDuality is a concept dating back to the early days of quark models. It is,\nhowever, rarely appreciated that over the last several years it has become a\nfairly precise concept in heavy flavour decays rather than the qualitative one\nit used to be; it also has to be viewed in the context of the paradigm that\nQCD is the theory of strong interactions. The corrollary of the latter is the\nstatement that even hadronic observables can be evaluated exactly on the\nquark-gluon level provided all possible corrections to the quark-parton result\nare properly accounted for. Duality violations are thus due to corrections\nthat could not be included due to a limitation in the algorithm employed.\nThe OPE has intrinsic limitations: when constructed in Euclidean space\nit has no sensitivity to terms of the type, say, exp{\u2212mQ /\u039b}. Such innocuous\ncontributions turn into 'oscillating' terms \u223c sin(mQ /\u039b) upon continuation\nto Minkowski space. Therefore the OPE will in general not yield correct\npredictions point for point in mQ (or E etc.): some averaging or 'smearing'\nin that variable will be required; i.e., local duality will in general not hold.\nFurthermore the expansion even for Euclidean quantities is only asymptotic\nin 1/mc and thus has irreducible errors even in principle.\nIn summary: charm studies can serve as a microscope for duality . At\nbest we will encounter sizeable uncertainties; at worst we might be forced to\nconclude that duality is not operative yet at the charm scale.\n\n2.4\n\nA case study: D0 \u2212 D\u03040 oscillations\n\nOscillations are described by the normalized mass and width differences:\n\u2206\u0393\nD\nxD \u2261 \u2206M\n, yD \u2261 2\u0393\n.

Obviously all measurements are still\nconsistent with zero. Yet to judge how significant that statement is, we have\nto examine what the SM expectations are.\nWith D 0 \u2192 f \u2192 D\u0304 0 transition amplitudes being proportional to sin\u03b8C2\none has xD , yD \u2264 0.05; furthermore in the limit of SU(3)F l symmetry those\namplitudes have to vanish. However a priori one cannot count on that being a very strong suppression for the real world; thus xD , yD \u223c O(0.01)\nrepresents a conservative SM bound. On general grounds I find it unlikely\n\u2013 though mathematically possible \u2013 that New Physics could overcome the\nCabibbo bound significantly. Comparing this general bound on the oscillation variables to the data listed in Eq.(5), I conclude the hunt for New\nPhysics realistically has only just begun!\nOne can give a more sophisticated SM estimate for xD , yD . There\nexists an extensive literature on it; however some relevant features were\nmissed for a long time. Quark box diagrams yield tiny contributions only:\nxD (box) \u223c few \u00d7 10\u22125 . Various schemes are then invoked to describe selected hadronic intermediate states to guestimate the impact of long distance\ndynamics: xD (LD), yD (LD) \u223c 10\u22124 \u221210\u22123 . Recently a new analysis [11] has\nbeen given based on an OPE providing a systematic treatment in powers of\n1/mc , the GIM factors ms and the CKM parameters. It finds that the GIM\nsuppression by a factor of (ms /mc )4 , which is behind the result stated on\nxD (box) is untypically severe [12]. There are contributions with gentle GIM\nfactors proportional to m2s /\u03bc2had or even ms /\u03bchad . They are due to higherdimensional operators and thus accompanied by higher powers of 1/mc . Since\nthose are not greatly suppressed, contributions of formally higher order in\n1/mc can become numerically leading if they are of lower order in ms . These\nterms are actually due to condensate terms in the OPE, namely h0|q\u0304q|0i etc.\nOn the conceptual side we have achieved significant progress: it is again the\nOPE that allows to incorporate nonperturbative dynamics from the start in\n\n7\n\n\fa self-consistent way. Numerically there is no decisive change, although the\nnumbers are somewhat larger with a better appreciation of the uncertainties:\nxD (SM)|OP E , yD (SM)|OP E \u223c O(10\u22123 ) .\n\n(7)\n\nYet despite the similarities in numbers for xD and yD the dynamics driving\nthese two \u2206C = 2 observables are quite different:\n\u2022 \u2206mD being generated by contributions from virtual states is sensitive\nto New Physics which could raise it to the percent level. At the same\ntime it necessarily involves an integral over energies thus making it\nrather robust against violations of local duality.\n\u2022 \u2206\u0393D being driven by on-shell transitions can hardly be sensitive to New\nPhysics. At the same time, however, it is very vulnerable to violations\nof local duality: a nearby narrow resonance could easily wreck any GIM\ncancellation and raise the value of \u2206\u0393D by an order of magnitude!\nIf data revealed yD \u226a xD \u223c 1% we would have a strong case to infer the\nintervention of New Physics. If on the other hand yD \u223c 1% \u2013 as hinted at by\nthe FOCUS data \u2013 then two scenarios could arise: if xD \u2264 few \u00d7 10\u22123 were\nfound, one would infer that the 1/mc expansion within the SM yields a correct\nsemiquantitative result while blaming the \"large\" value for yD on a sizeable\nand not totally surprising violation of duality. If, however, xD \u223c 0.01 would\nemerge, we would face a theoretical conundrum: an interpretation ascribing\nthis to New Physics would hardly be convincing since xD \u223c yD . To base a\ncase for New Physics solely on the observation of D 0 \u2212 D\u0304 0 oscillations is thus\nof uncertain value, unless xD is found to exceed yD significantly!\n\n3\n\nCP violation in charm decays\n\nMost of us view the SM as incomplete, and our efforts are focussed on uncovering New Physics. Charm decays have a good potential to reveal interventions of New Physics that might not be manifest in beauty decays [13].\nFor charm quarks are the only up-type quark allowing a full range of indirect searches for New Physics. While D 0 \u2212 D\u0304 0 oscillations are slow, T 0 \u2212 T\u0304 0\noscillations cannot occur at all, nor can CP violation there, since top quarks\ndecay before they can hadronize [14]. Direct CP violation can emerge in\n8\n\n\fchannel\nD0 \u2192 K + K \u2212\nD0 \u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212\nD\u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 K \u2212 \u03c0+\nD 0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 0\nD0 \u2192 \u03c00\u03c00\n\nWorld Average '00 CLEO '01\n(0.5 \u00b1 1.6)%\n(0.1 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b1 0.8)%\n(2.2 \u00b1 2.6)%\n(2.0 \u00b1 3.2 \u00b1 0.8)%\n(0.2 \u00b1 1.1)%\n(0.1 \u00b1 1.3)%\n(0.1 \u00b1 4.8)%\n\nTable 1: Data on direct CP asymmetries in D decays\nexclusive modes that command decent branching ratios for charm, but are\nreally tiny for top with little coherence left. Finally charm decays proceed\nin an environment populated with many resonances which induce final state\ninteractions (FSI) of great vibrancy. While this feature complicates the interpretations of a signal (or lack thereof) in terms of microscopic quantities, it\nis optimal for getting an observable signal. In that sense it should be viewed\nas a virtue rather than a vice.\nCharm hadrons provide several practical advantages: their production\nrates are relatively large; they possess long lifetimes and D \u2217 \u2192 D\u03c0 decays\nprovide as good a flavour tag as one can have. Charm transitions should thus\nbe viewed as a unique portal for studying the flavour sector.\nThe most promising probe in such an enterprise is a comprehensive search\nfor CP violation. The data are summarized in Table 1 [15, 16]. All numbers\nare still consistent with zero \u2013 on the level of a few percent. This represents\nan impressive increase in experimental sensitivity. Yet at the same time I\nconsider it unlikely (though not inconceivable) that New Physics could induce\nCP asymmetries of 10 percent or more. Therefore the search for CP violation\nin charm transitions only now has entered a phase with real promise.\n\n3.1\n\nCP Violation \u2013 Expectations\n\n(i) Direct CP Violation in Partial Widths\nFor an asymmetry to become observable between CP conjugate partial\nwidths, one needs two coherent amplitudes with a relative weak phase and a\nnontrivial strong phase shift.\nIn Cabibbo favoured as well as in doubly Cabibbo suppressed channels\nthose requirements can be met with New Physics only. There is one exception\n\n9\n\n\fto this general statement [17]: the transition D \u00b1 \u2192 KS \u03c0 \u00b1 reflects the interference between D + \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 + and D + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + which are Cabibbo favoured\nand doubly Cabibbo suppressed, respectively. Furthermore in all likelihood\nthose two amplitudes will exhibit different phase shifts since they differ in\ntheir isospin content. The known CP impurity in the KS state induces a\ndifference without any theory uncertainty:\n\u0393(D + \u2192 KS \u03c0 + ) \u2212 \u0393(D \u2212 \u2192 KS \u03c0 \u2212 )\n= \u22122Re\u01ebK \u2243 \u22123.3 * 10\u22123\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u0393(D \u2192 KS \u03c0 ) + \u0393(D \u2192 KS \u03c0 )\n\n(8)\n\nIn that case the same asymmetry both in magnitude as well as sign arises\nfor the experimentally much more challenging final states KL \u03c0 \u00b1 . If on the\nother hand New Physics is present in \u2206C = 1 dynamics \u2013 most likely in the\ndoubly Cabibbo suppressed transition \u2013 then both the sign and the size of an\nasymmetry can be different from the number in Eq.(8), and by itself it would\nmake a contribution of the opposite sign to the asymmetry in D + \u2192 KL \u03c0 +\nvs. D \u2212 \u2192 KL \u03c0 \u2212 . An explicit model by D'Ambrosio and Gao [18] shows\nthat a CP asymmetry \u223c O(1%) could indeed be induced by New Physics\nthrough the doubly Cabibbo suppressed amplitude that would have escaped\ndetection so far; it would also affect \u2206mD only insignificantly!\nSearching for direct CP violation in Cabibbo suppressed D decays as a\nsign for New Physics would represent a very complex challenge: within the\nKM description one expects to find asymmetries of order 0.1 % [19, 20];\nyet it would be hard to conclusively rule out some more or less accidental\nenhancement due to a resonance etc. raising an asymmetry to the 1% level.\nObserving a CP asymmetry in charm decays would certainly be a first rate\ndiscovery irrespective of its theoretical interpretation. Yet to make a case\nthat a signal in a singly Cabibbo suppressed mode reveals New Physics is\niffy. One has to analyze at least several channels with comparable sensitivity\nto acquire a measure of confidence in one's interpretation.\n(ii) Direct CP Violation in Final State Distributions\nFor channels with two pseudoscalar mesons or a pseudoscalar and a vector meson a CP asymmetry can manifest itself only in a difference between\nconjugate partial widths. If, however, the final state is more complex \u2013 being\nmade up by three pseudoscalar or two vector mesons etc. \u2013 then it contains\nmore dynamical information than expressed by its partial width, and CP\nviolation can emerge also through asymmetries in final state distributions.\nOne general comment still applies: since also such CP asymmetries require\n10\n\n\fthe interference of two weak amplitudes, within the SM they can occur in\nCabibbo suppressed modes only.\nIn the simplest such scenario one compares CP conjugate Dalitz plots.\nIt is quite possible that different regions of a Dalitz plot exhibit CP asymmetries of varying signs that largely cancel each other when one integrates\nover the whole phase space. I.e., subdomains of the Dalitz plot could contain\nconsiderably larger CP asymmetries than the integrated partial width. Once\na Dalitz plot is fully understood with all its contributions, one has a powerful\nnew probe. This is not an easy goal to achieve, though, in particular when\nlooking for effects that presumably are not large. It might be more promising\nas a practical matter to start out with a more euristic approach. I.e., one\ncan start a search for CP asymmetries by just looking at conjugate Dalitz\nplots. One simple strategy would be to focus on an area with a resonance\nband and analyze the density in stripes across the resonance as to whether\nthere is a difference in CP conjugate plots.\nFor more complex final states containing four pseudoscalar mesons etc.\nother probes have to be employed. Consider, e.g., D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , where\none can form a T-odd correlation with the momenta: CT \u2261 h~pK + *(~p\u03c0+ \u00d7~p\u03c0\u2212 )i.\nUnder time reversal T one has CT \u2192 \u2212CT hence the name 'T-odd'. Yet\nCT 6= 0 does not necessarily establish T violation. Since time reversal is\nimplemented by an antiunitary operator, CT 6= 0 can be induced by FSI\n[24]. While in contrast to the situation with partial width differences FSI\nare not required to produce an effect, they can act as an 'imposter' here,\ni.e. induce a T-odd correlation with T-invariant dynamics. This ambiguity\ncan unequivoally be resolved by measuring C\u0304T \u2261 h~pK \u2212 * (~p\u03c0\u2212 \u00d7 p~\u03c0+ )i in\nD\u0304 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; finding CT 6= \u2212C\u0304T establishes CP violation without\nfurther ado.\nDecays of polarized charm baryons provide us with a similar class of observables; e.g., in \u039bc \u21d1 \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , one can analyse the T-odd correlation\nh~\u03c3\u039bc * (~p\u03c0+ \u00d7 ~p\u03c0\u2212 )i [21].\n(iii) CP violation involving D 0 \u2212 D\u0304 0 oscillations\nThe interpretation is much clearer for a CP asymmetry involving oscillations, where one compares the time evolution of transitions like D 0 (t) \u2192\nKS \u03c6, K + K \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [22] and/or D 0 (t) \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 [23] with their CP conjugate\nchannels. A difference for a final state f would depend on the product\nq\nsin(\u2206mD t) * Im [T (D\u0304 \u2192 f )/T (D \u2192 f \u0304)] .\n(9)\np\n11\n\n\fWith both factors being \u223c O(10\u22123 ) in the SM one predicts a practically\nzero asymmetry \u2264 10\u22125 . Yet New Physics could generate considerably larger\nvalues, namely xD \u223c O(0.01), Im pq [T (D\u0304 \u2192 f )/T (D \u2192 f \u0304)] \u223c O(0.1) leading\nto an asymmetry of O(10\u22123 ). One should note that the oscillation dependant\nterm is linear in the small quantity xD (and in t) \u2013 sin\u2206mD t \u2243 xD t/\u03c4D \u2013 in\n2\n0 \u2192l\u2212 X\nx2D +yD\n\u2243\n. It would be very\ncontrast to rD which is quadratic: rD \u2261 D\n0\n+\nD \u2192l X\n2\nhard to see rD = 10\u22124 in CP insensitive rates. It could well happen that\nD 0 \u2212 D\u0304 0 oscillations are first discovered in such CP asymmetries!\n\n4\n\nSummary and Outlook\n\nWe have learnt many important lessons from charm studies. Yet even so, they\ndo not represent a closed chapter. On one hand charm physics can teach us\nmany more important lessons about QCD and its nonperturbative dynamics\nbeyond calibration work needed for a better analysis of beauty decays. On\nthe other it provides a unique portal to New Physics through up-type quark\ndynamics. In this latter quest only now have we begun to enter promising\nterritory, namely gaining sensitivity for xD and yD values of order percent\nand likewise for CP asymmetries.\nWithout a specific theory of New Physics one has to strike a balance between the requirements of feasibility and the demands of making a sufficiently\nlarge step beyond what is known when advocating benchmark numbers for\nthe experimental sensitivity. In that spirit I suggest the following numbers:\n1. Probe D 0 \u2212 D\u0304 0 oscillations down to xD , yD \u223c O(10\u22123 )=r\n\u02c6 D \u2264 O(10\u22125 ).\n2. Search for time dependant CP asymmetries in D 0 (t) \u2192 K + K \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ,\nKS \u03c6 down to the 10\u22124 level and in the doubly Cabibbo suppressed\nmode D 0 (t) \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 to the 10\u22123 level.\n3. Look for asymmetries in the partial widths for D \u00b1 \u2192 KS[L] \u03c0 \u00b1 down to\n10\u22123 and likewise in a host of singly Cabibbo suppressede modes.\n4. Analyze Dalitz plots and T-odd correlations etc. with a sensitivity\ndown to O(10\u22123 ).\nHuge amounts of new information on charm dynamics will become available\ndue to data already taken by FOCUS and SELEX and being taken at the B\n12\n\n\ffactories; there is activity to be hoped for at Compass, BTeV and LHC-B.\nAnd finally there are the activities that could be pursued at a tau-charm\nfactory at Cornell. We can be sure to learn many relevant lessons from such\nstudies \u2013 and there may be surprises when we least expect it.\n\nAcknowledgments\nMany thanks go to Flavio Costantino and his team for organizing an inspiring meeting in the classy setting that Pisa (with some assistance from San\nGimignano and Lucca) can provide like very few places in the world: the\ncathedral complex reminds us for what kind of yardstick for our work we\nshould ultimately aim.
