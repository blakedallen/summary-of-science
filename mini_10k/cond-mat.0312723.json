On a apital market the so ial\ngroup is formed from those who are buying and selling shares. In general the\nso ial group we hara terise in a ordan e with T. Plummer / The Psy hology\nof Te hni al Analysis, rev.ed., Probus Pub.Comp., Chi ago, 1993/. We assume\nthat individual behaviour of agents is in\u001duen ed to some degree by the need\nto asso iate with other agents and to obtain the approval of other agents in\nthe group. The group is hara terised by a very large nonrational and emotional element to de isions of agents. It is due to the fa t that making de isions\nan individual equates own needs with those of the other agents from the group.\nAny two agents from the group may intera t. The intera tion onsists of the exhange of information and it osts some energy. The information is well de\u001cned,\nand we assume that agents intera t in su h a way that they give referen e to the\norigin of the information if asked by other agents. Thus the agent may verify obtained information. It is natural then that there exits a subgroup of intera ting\nagents the intera tion of whi h has the following property: it is nonredu ible in\nthe sense that in this subgroup there exists the intera tion of a given agent with\nanother one, this another one agent again intera ts with another agent, and beause it has no sense to ex hange the information with the \u001crst one to verify the\ninformation, this last mentioned agent is di\u001berent from the \u001crst one. This third\nagent an thus always verify the information from two sour es either intera ting\nwith the \u001crst one, either he/she is intera ting with the fourth agent. In the \u001crst\nase we have a minimal subgroup of intera ting agents, whi h form a losed\nsubroup in whi h every agent veri\u001ces information from two sour es - agents. In\nthe se ond ase the fourth agent either intera ts with the \u001crst one and veri\u001ces\nex hanged information, either with the se ond one and veri\u001ces information. He\nof ourse an intera t with the third one agent, however to veri\u001cy information\nhe needs again to intera t with di\u001berent agent from that intera ting with whi h\nhe obtained the new information. This is the reason why he intera ts either\nwith the \u001crst one agent, either with the se ond one. In the \u001crst ase we have a\nlosed subgroup of four agents in whi h every agent intera ts with two agents.\nIn the se ond ase the losed subgroup redu es to the group of three intera ting\nagents /last three agents /, verify information intera ting with the \u001cfth agent.\nThen by the same pro edure as in previous ase we may obtain nonredu ibile\nsubgroups of three, of four and of \u001cve agents, or the \u001cfth agent intera ts with the\nsixth one. And so on. Thus we obtain losed subgroups of intera ting agents in\nwhi h every agent intera ts with two other agents, and in whi h the pro ess of\nveri\u001c ation of information leads to losed linear stru ture. If any of agents from\nsu h an subgroup ex hange and thus veri\u001ces information with any third one\nagent from the subroup, the stru ture of the subgroup hanges, the subgroup\nbe omes redu ibile to two new nonredu ibile subgroups. This is the pro ess of\ndi\u001berentiation of the \u001crst nonredu ibile subgroup to two new ones. This is an\nexample of an elementary transformation between two on\u001cgurations of nonredu ibile subroups. An vi e versa: if the intera tion between two agents whi h\nintera t with three agents in the on\u001cguration of two nonredu ibile subgroups\nvanishes, a new one nonredu ibile subgroup reates and information is still veri\u001cable. When the on\u001cguration in whi h an agent was intera ting with three\nagents whi h were not intera ting between themselves transform to a on\u001cguration in whi h two of the mentioned three agents intera t, then we may observe\n\n\f3\nthe pro ess of mitosis: a new nonredu ibile group appears.Thus the transformation between this two on\u001cgurations is reversibile. A ell is su h a on\u001cguration\nof a given number of nonredu ible subgroups in whi h every two intera ting\nagents belongs to two nonredu ibile subgroups /subgroups are onne ted in this\nsense / and whi h is losed . Su h a ell may disappear and may be reated,\nmay hange number of nonredu ible subroups in a reversible way. Be asue the\nstru ture, on\u001cguration of intera tions between agents in the group, forms a\nma ros opi stru ture, we say that it is a mi roreversible pro ess any pro ess\nwithin a nonredu ibile subgroup and within a ell. Statisti al equilibrium of\nthe whole group is hara terized by a set of di\u001berent subroups of the type mentioned above, and by a probability that su h a subgroup o urs. Thus we have\nprobability distribution whi h hara terizes the group. Moreover there exists an\nequation of state whi h enables to ompare di\u001berent ma ros opi states of the\ngroup.The statisti al equilibrium due to mi roreversibility is hara terised by\nthe maximum of entropy and by the minumum of energy / osts of information\nex hange/. There exist onstrains, su h as a \u001cxed number V of agents in the\ngroup, a number E of intera tions within the group, a number F of subgroups\nwhi h are nonredu ibile, and a number C of ells. Thus we have a stru ture\nwhi h is equivalent to random ellular networks. Su h networks and their evolution were des ribed by N. Rivier /Physi a 23D (1986) p. 129/. He applied\nmethods of statisti al me hani s to study these stru tures. We will use methods\ndes ribed by Rivier to study so ial behaviour of agents, mainly the presen e of\ntopologi al stru ture of intera tions between agents and its hanges, whi h is\nthe most important property of the group of agents. The area of a nonredu ibile\ngroup whi h belongs to those nonredu ibile groups whi h form the ell may be\nformed again for example by a sum of areas of agents hara teristi areas. Note\nthat area of the nonredu ibile group may be also some other hara teristi s of\nthe group of agents depending on studied so ial relations between agents. Thus\nwe are able to study topology properties of intera tions of agents. Their so ial\nbehaviour is dis ussed. It an be shown that the equilibrium number of agents\nwith whi h a given agent intera ts is three for a group without ellls /the group\nforms a single ell/.\n\n\f4\n2\n\nIntrodu tion\n\nWe all in a so ial group its members as agents. In general the so ial group is\nhara terised in a ordan e with T. Plummer [1\u2104 . We assume that individual\nbehaviour of agents is in\u001duen ed to some degree by the need to asso iate with\nother agents and to obtain the approval of other agents in the group. The group\nis hara terised by a very large nonrational and emotional element to de isions\nof agents. It is due to the fa t that making de isions an individual equates own\nneeds with those of the other agents from the group. Any two agents from the\ngroup may intera t. The intera tion onsists of the ex hange of information and\nit osts some energy. The information is well de\u001cned, and we assume that agents\nintera t in su h a way that they give referen e to the origin of the information\nif asked by other agents. Thus the agent may verify obtained information. It\nis natural then that there exits a subroup of intera ting agents the intera tion\nof whi h has the following property: it is nonredu ible in the sense that in this\nsubgroup there exists the intera tion of a given agent with another one, this\nanother one agent again intera ts with another agent, and be ause it has no\nsense to ex hange the information with the \u001crst one to verify the information,\nthis last mentioned agent is di\u001berent from the \u001crst one. This third agent an\nthus always verify the information from two sour es either intera ting with the\n\u001crst one, either he/she is intera ting with the fourth agent. In the \u001crst ase we\nhave a minimal subgroup of intera ting agents, whi h form a losed subroup in\nwhi h every agent veri\u001ces information from two sour es - agents. In the se ond\nase the fourth agent either intera ts with the \u001crst one and veri\u001ces ex hanged\ninformation, either with the se ond one and veri\u001ces information. He of ourse\nan intera t with the third one agent, however to veri\u001cy information he needs\nagain to intera t with di\u001berent agent from that intera ting with whi h he obtained the new information. This is the reason why he intera ts either with the\n\u001crst one agent, either with the se ond one. In the \u001crst ase we have a losed\nsubgroup of four agents in whi h every agent intera ts with two agents. In the\nse ond ase the losed subgroup redu es to the group of three intera ting agents\n/last three agents /. This pro ess an ontinue futher, be ause the fourth agent\nmay also verify information intera ting with the \u001cfth agent. Then by the same\npro edure as in previous ase we may obtain nonredu ibile subgroups of three,\nof four and of \u001cve agents, or the \u001cfth agent intera ts with the sixth one. And so\non. Thus we obtain losed subroups of intera ting agents in whi h every agent\nintera ts with two other agents, and in whi h the pro ess of veri\u001c ation of information leads to losed linear stru ture. If any of agents from su h an subgroup\nex hange and thus veri\u001ces information with any third one agent from the subroup, the stru ture of the subgroup hanges, the subgroup be omes redu ibile\nto two new nonredu ibile subgroups. This is the pro ess of di\u001berentiation of\nthe \u001crst nonredu ibile subgroup to two new ones. This is an example of an elementary transformation between two on\u001cgurations of nonredu ibile subroups.\nAn vi e versa: if the intera tion between two agents whi h intera t with three\nagents in the on\u001cguration of two nonredu ibile subgroups vanishes, a new one\nnonredu ibile subgroup reates and information is still veri\u001cable. When the\non\u001cguration in whi h an agent was intera ting with three agents whi h were\nnot intera ting between themselves transform to a on\u001cguration in whi h two of\nthe mentioned three agents intera t, then we may observe the pro ess of mitosis:\na new nonredu ibile group appears.Thus the transformation between this two\n\n\f5\non\u001cgurations is reversibile. A ell is su h a on\u001cguration of a given number\nof nonredu ible subroups in whi h every two intera ting agents belongs to two\nnonredu ibile subgroups /subgroups are onne ted in this sense / and whi h is\nlosed . Su h a ell may disappear and may be reated, may hange number\nof nonredu ible subroups in a reversible way. Be asue the stru ture, on\u001cguration of intera tions between agents in the group, forms a ma ros opi stru ture,\nwe say that it is a mi roreversible pro ess any pro ess within a nonredu ibile\nsubgroup and within a ell. Statisti al equilibrium of the whole group is hara terized by a set of di\u001berent subroups of the type mentioned above, and by\na probability that su h a subroup o urs. Thus we have probability distribution whi h hara terizes the group. Moreover there exists an equation of state\nwhi h enables to ompare di\u001berent ma ros opi states of the group.The statisti al equilibrium due to mi roreversibility is hara terised by the maximum\nof entropy and by the minumum of energy / osts of information ex hange/.\nWe will use methods of statisti al physi s to study so ial behaviour of agents,\nmainly the presen e of topologi al stru ture of intera tions between agents and\nits hanges, whi h is the most important property of the group of agents. There\nare three empiri aly observed dependen ies of personal radius whi h enabled us\nto hara terize the quantities of ells, fa es, verti es and bonds [2\u2104. There exist\nonstrains, su h as a \u001cxed number V of agents in the group, a number E of intera tions within the group, a number F of subgroups whi h are nonredu ibile,\nand a number C of ells. Thus we have a stru ture whi h is equivalent to random ellular networks. Su h networks and their evolution were des ribed by [3\u2104,\n[4\u2104 N. Rivier /Physi a 23D (1986) p. 129/. He applied methods of statisti al\nme hani s to study these stru tures. We will use methods des ribed by Rivier\nto study so ial behaviour of agents, mainly the presen e of topologi al stru ture\nof intera tions between agents and its hanges, whi h is the most important\nproperty of the group of agents. The area of a nonredu ibile group whi h belongs to those nonredu ibile groups whi h form the ell may be formed again\nfor example by a sum of areas of agents hara teristi areas. Note that area of\nthe nonredu ibile group may be also some other hara teristi s of the group of\nagents depending on studied so ial relations between agents. Thus we are able\nto study topology properties of intera tions of agents. Their so ial behaviour is\ndis ussed in. It an be shown that the equilibrium number of agents with whi h\na given agent intera ts is three for a group without ellls /the group forms a\nsingle ell/.\n3\n\nHuman groupings have hierar hi al stru ture.\n\nHuman groupings have hierar hi al stru ture, for an introdu tion see [1\u2104. The\nivilisation onsists of so ietes, so ietes onsist of groups, and groups onsist of\nindividuals. A so ial group has power to rganise individuals and se them for its\nown purposes. An agent we all a member of a so ial group, we assume that\nhis/her spe ial properties are de\u001cned.\nAgent - its behaviour is in\u001duen ed to some degree by the need to asso iate\nwith other agents and to obtain the approval of other agents in the group [1\u2104.\nA group is harar terized by a very large nonrational and emotional elements\nin de isions of agents, and agent equates his/her needs with those of the other\nagents from the group [1\u2104. Equates here means intera ts, intera tion osts some\n\n\f6\nenergy and onsists of the ex hange of information about his/her needs, the\ninformation is well de\u001cned. Spe i\u001c ation of agents here: agents intera t in su h\na way that they give referen e to the origin of the information if asked by the\nother agent. Thus an agent may verify obtained information.\nNonredu ible subgroup of the group of agents is a group whi h de\u001cned in the\nfollowing way. There exists intera tion of a given agent with another one. This\nanother one agent intera ts with another one. it has no sense for him/her to\nex hange information with the \u001crst one to verify information /to obtain approval\nof at least another one agent/: thus the agent intera ts with and agent diferent\nfrom the \u001crst one. This the third agent an verify the information from two\nsour es: either intera ting with the \u001crst one, either intera ting with the fourth\none. The \u001crst ase leads to formation of a nonredu ibile subgroup of three\nagents in whi h every agent veri\u001ces information from two di\u001berent sour es /we\nasuem that information is veri\u001ced if an agent veri\u001ces information from at least\ntwo di\u001berent sour es/. The se ond ase: the fourth agent intera ts either with\nthe \u001crst one, and we ontain a nonredu ibile subgroup of four agents, either this\nagent intera ts with the se ond agent, and we obtain a nonredu ibile subgroup\nof three agents, this pro ess may ontinue further: the fourth agent may veri\u001cy\ninformation intera ting with the \u001crst ones, the pro ess just des ribes now may\nlead to a nonredu ibile subgroup with three, four or \u001cve agents, et . Thus in the\ngroup of intera ting agents there exist nonredu ibile subgroups of agents whi h\nare losed as on erning ex hange of an information and in whi h every agent\nintera ts with two and only two other agents, thus the stru ture of intera tion\nof agents is \"linear- ir ular\".\n4\n\nNonredu ibile subgroups of the group of agents\nmay transform.\n\nRedu tion of a nonredu ibile subgroup to two nonredu ibile subgroups: if any\nagent from a given nonredu ibile subgroup intera ts as on erning ex hange of\nan information with a third one agent from the nonredu ibile subgroup. And\nvi e versa: if the intera tion as on erning ex hange of an information between\ntwo agents in the on\u001cguration of two nonredu ibile subgroups vanishes, a new\none nonredu ibile subgroup appears. Mitosis is a pro ess in whi h an agent\nwhi h was intera ting with three agents whi h were not intera ting between\nthemselves transforms to a on\u001cguration in whi h two of the mentioned three\nagents intera t, then a new nonred ibile subgroup appears, this pro ess is reversibile.\nCell is a on\u001cguration of a given number of nonredu ibile subgroups in whi h\neverz two intera ting agents belong to two nonred ibile subgroups of a losed\nsubgroup formed from nonredu ibile subgroups. Cella of the group of agents\nmay reversible transform, they may disappear, may be reated, may hange a\nnumber of nonredu ibile subgroups.\n5\n\nThe stru ture of the group is ma ros opi\n\nThe group has a given number of agents, of nonredu ibile subgroups and of\nells as on erning ex hange of information. Statisti al equilibrium of the group\n\n\f7\nis hara terized by di\u001berent ma ros opi stru ture as on erning ex hange of\nan information and by a probability that a nonredu ible group appears, this\nprobability hara terizes the group. Equation of state omparison of di\u001berent\nma ros opi states of the group. Statisti al equilibrium exist in the group due to\nreversibility, it is hara terized by the maximum of entropy and by the minimum\nof energy / osts of information ex hange/. Constraints are given by a \u001cxed\nnumber V of agents in the group, a number E of intera tions, a number F of\nsubgroups whi h are nonredu ibile, a number C of ells, note that onservation\nlaw holds [4\u2104:\n\u2212 C + FE + V = 0\n(1)\nNote that stru tural stability exists [4\u2104: only agents with intera tion with\nfour agents are stru turaly stable in 3d, and only agents with intera tion with\nthree agents are stru turaly stable in 2d. This stru ture is equivalent to random ellular networks, su h networks and their evolution were des ribed by N.\nRIVIER [3\u2104, [4\u2104 by methods statisti al me hani s.\nWe will use these methods to study so ial behaviour of agents, and hanges\nof this behaviour, mainly the presen e of the topologi al stru ture of intera tions\nbetween agents and its hanges, the most important property of the group of\nagents whi h oresponds to maximum of informational entropy.\nOne an de\u001cne an area of nonredu ibile subgroup and volume of the ell.\nWe asume that there is homogeneity, and no osts of information.\n6\n\nPersonal area and so ial behaviour of agents of\nthe group\n\nThe average area A(n) of an n-sided ell is [3\u2104, [4\u2104 / if A is the total area in\nwhi h group is lo alised/:\nA(n) =\n\nA\n1\n\u03bb(n \u2212 (6 \u2212 ))\nF\n\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\nAsume that this area orresponds to a personal area of agents forming an nsised nonredu ibile subgroup, due to homogeneity and equilibrium every agent\nontributes 13 personal area A(n), thus \u03bb = 61 and\nA(n) =\n\nAn\nF 6\n\n(3)\n\nOne agent ontributes 13 of his personal area to the area A(n), if we denote\nr the radius of the agent's personal area then:\n\u03c0r2\nA\n=\n3\n6F\n\n(4)\n\nAs we see personal radius in reases as a square root with in reased\ntotal area A per a nonredu ibile group. As we see personal radius de reases\nas an inverse square root with in reasing number of nonredu ibile groups, in\ntowns personal area is observed to be smaller than in villages [2\u2104, this orresponds to smaller FA ratio in towns than in villages a ording to our equation\nabove, the ratio FA is more-less onstant in area A in these ases, however it\n\n\f8\nis in reasing with the density of agents in the group (town, village) and thus\nnumber of nonredu ibile groups is in reasing in our equation for personal area\nqualitatively, personal radius is in reasing with de reasing risk whi h a person\nexpe ts [2\u2104: intimous - smaller radius is 0.15 m and less for intimous onta ts\n/love, se urity, ... /, intimous - larger radius is 0.15 m to 0.45 m for less intimous\nonta ts /relatives/, personal - smaller radius is 0.45 m to 0.90 m for personal\nonta ts with lose friends and relatives, personal - larger radius is 0.90 m to 1.20\nm for personal onta ts with friend, bussines people, neoghbours. Thus we see\nfrom our equation that F may be asso iated with risk: for onstant area A the\nlarger F the smaller r and smaller a eptable risk (*). Personal radius is large\nfor inhabitants [2\u2104 of New Zeeland, Australia and white North-Ameri ans, it is\nmiddle for inhabitants of Great Britain, Switzerland, Sverige, Germany, Austria and it is small for inhabitants of Arab ountries, Japans, South-Ameri ans,\ninhabitants of ountries around Middleterrenien sea /Italy, Fran e, Gree e, ...\n/ and bla k North-Ameri ans: one an say qualitatively that (probably due to\ntemperament) the \u001crst group is hara terised by low risk a tivities and by their\npreferen e, the se ond group is hara terised by middle risk a tivities, and the\nlast group is hara terised by high risk a tivities. Thus \u001crst group has F lower\nthan the se ond group, and se ond group lower than the third group: this is\nonsistent with the statement (*).\n7\n\nCon lusion\n\nWe on lude that the three mentioned empiri aly observed dependen ies of personal radius dependen e on some fa tors enabled us to hara terize the quantity\nF as the quantity whi h hara teriyes veri\u001c ation of information, the smaller\npersonal radius the larger pro ess of veri\u001c ation of verbal and non-verbal information about the other person in other to a ept the risk that this person\nwill be loser to us as a person.
