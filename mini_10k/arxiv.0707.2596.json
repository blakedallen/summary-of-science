This work serves as the\nextended complementary version of the one page comment submitted to Physical Review Letters.\nPACS numbers: 73.23.-b 72.70.+m 71.55.Jv 73.61.Jc 73.50.-h 73.50.Td\n\nThe problem of Anderson localization in the presence\nof an interaction attracts a large attention since the concept of localization has been suggested in the classical\nwork.[2] Particularly, the long-range interaction 1/Ra\nwith a sufficiently small exponent a (a \u2264 3) can lead to\nthe delocalization at arbitrarily strong disordering.[2, 3]\nThe ensemble of two level systems (TLS) in amorphous solids [4] is the particularly interesting system to\nstudy the effect of the long-range many-body interaction\nJ(R) \u223c U0 /R3 on the localization, because the interaction is extremely weak their, i. e. the dimensionless product of the density of two level system states P0\nand their interaction constant U0 , is the universally small\nvalue around 10\u22123 .[5] After the experimental demonstration that the low temperature TLS relaxation rate shows\nlinear temperature dependence [6, 7, 8] instead of T 3 dependence due to the TLS-phonon interaction we propose\nthe scenario, where this anomaly was explained by the\nTLS interaction stimulated delocalization leading to the\nirreversible relaxation.[9]\nRecently the model of a TLS interaction stimulated\nrelaxation has been considered by Bodea et al.[1] They\nobtained the estimate of the TLS relaxation rate different from Ref. [9] both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nThe method used in Ref. [1] was based on the analysis\nof resonant couplings developed in our previous work.[9]\nThe number of resonant couplings of single TLS with\nsurrounding TLS (resonant pairs) and TLS pairs (reso-\n\nnant triples) were calculated. The resonant coupling was\ndefined as in Refs. [3, 9], namely two entities A and B\nare in resonance, when their joint transition amplitude\nVAB induced by their interaction exceeds the difference\nbetween their energies EA \u2212 EB calculated ignoring their\ninteraction. The criterion for energy delocalization was\nchosen using the condition of Ref. [9] that the given TLS\nhave more than one resonant interactions.\nThe number of resonant pairs W2 per the single TLS\nwas found to be very small [1] in full agreement with\nRef. [9] where this estimate was already made. Below we\nreproduce this estimate to save time of the reader. The\nHamiltonian of two interacting TLS can be expressed as\n\u2212 \u2206i Siz \u2212 \u2206j Sjz \u2212 \u22060i Six \u2212 \u22060j Sjx \u2212 Uij Siz Sjz .\n\n(1)\n\nThen we can develop analytical approach for double transitions treating TLS interaction as a perturbation. To\ndevelop the perturbation theory with respect to the interaction we diagonalize the noninteracting Hamiltonian\nintroducing new spin operators\nszi =\n\n\u22060i z \u2206i x\n\u2206i z \u22060i x x\nS +\nS , si = \u2212\nS +\nS ,\nEi i\nEi i\nEi i\nEi i\nq\nEi,j = \u22062i,j + \u220620i,j\n\n(2)\n\nThen the Hamiltonian of pair can be rewritten as\n\nz\nx \u2206 sz \u2212 \u2206 sx\n0j j\nb pair = H\nb0 + U\nb, H\nb 0 = \u2212Ei szi \u2212 Ej szj , U\nb = \u2212 1 Uij \u2206i si \u2212 \u22060i si j j\n.\nH\n2\nEi\nEj\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nThe basis states of the Hamiltonian H0 can be represented in terms of the projections of spins szi = \u00b1szj =\n\u00b11/2 =| \u00b1 >. The transition amplitude of the pair\n| + \u2212 >\u2192 | \u2212 + > is defined by the as the corresponding\nmatrix element of interacting Hamiltonian\nJij =\n\n\u22060i \u22060j\n1\n.\nUij\n4\nEi Ej\n\n(4)\n\nThe resonant pair is formed when\n| Ei \u2212 Ej |< Jij .\n\n(5)\n\nThe probability of resonance for the single pair can be\nestimated as g | Jij |, where g is the width of the distribution of a given TLS over energies. Then we need to\nsum all probabilities over all neighbouring TLS j. This\nsum can be expressed as the integral\nZ\nZ\nd\u22060j\nW2 \u2248 P0\ndrj | Jij |\n\u22060j\n\u03b8(\u03bbT \u2212 rj )\u03b8(rj \u2212 aT )\n\u0013\n\u0012\nkB T\n\u226a 1,\n(6)\n\u2248 P0 U0 ln\n~\u03b3ph\nwhere the distance rj is taken in the range between their\nminimum value aT \u223c (U0 /T )1/3 and the resonant phonon\nwavelength \u03bbT = c/T where c is the sound velocity. The\ndistance cannot exceed the minimum distance because\nat shorter distances the interaction between TLS exceeds\ntheir thermal energy and therefore it is a very small probability to find any of them in the excited state. The upper constraint is because the interaction length is always\nrestricted to the resonant wavelength. We also use the\nnotation \u03b3ph \u223c U0 /(\u03bb3T ~) corresponding to the TLS relaxation time associated with their interaction constant\nas in [1].\nHowever, in contrast with [9] Bodea et al found that\neach TLS has the large number of triple resonant interactions with surrounding pairs of other TLS. According to\n[1] this should lead to the delocalization of TLS energy\n\nb triple1 = H\nb0 + U\nb, H\nb0 = \u2212\nH\n\n3\nX\n\nand the irreversible relaxation of each TLS. On our opinion the estimate of the number of resonant triples W3\nmade in Ref. [1] exceeds the real value because the authors overestimated the triple TLS transition amplitude\nJ assuming\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n2\n.\nJ 2 = (\u2206i /Ei ) Jik\n+ (\u2206i /Ei ) Jjk\n\np\nHere \u2206 and E = \u22062 + \u220620 are asymmetry energy and\nenergy of TLS, while \u22060 is its tunnelling amplitude. The\nexpression Eq. (7) for the triple transition amplitude\nJ leads to the result, which conflicts with the common\nsense, that if the TLS j is located arbitrarily far from\nTLS i and k (Rij \u2248 Rjk \u226b Rik ) then the amplitude\nJ does not depend on the long distance Rij and is defined only by the short distance Rik leading to the result\n3\nJ \u2248 ui Jik \u223c U0 /Rik\n. On our opinion the triple TLS\ntransition amplitude should vanish with vanishing the\ncoupling between far separated entities. To prove that\nwe perform analytical and numerical calculations of the\ntriple transition amplitude and estimate the number of\nresonant triples that turns out to be much less then one.\nTo calculate the triple transition amplitude we introduce the triple TLS pseudospin Hamiltonian\nb triple = \u2212\nH\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2206i Siz \u2212\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\n\u22060i Six \u2212\n\n3\n1 X\nUij Siz Sjz . (8)\n2 i,j=1\n\n3\nThe long-range interaction Uij \u2248 U0 /Rij\nessentially contributes to the delocalization for the far separated TLSs\nso we assume that\np the interaction is smaller than all TLS\nenergies E = \u22062 + \u220620 . This condition is satisfied in\nall previous studies for relevant TLS clusters.[1, 9] Then\nwe can develop analytical approach for triple transitions\ntreating TLS interaction as a perturbation. To develop\nthe perturbation theory with respect to the interaction\nwe diagonalize the noninteracting Hamiltonian introducing new spin operators similar to Eq. (2). The effective\nHamiltonian reads\n\n3\nX\n\u2206j szi \u2212 \u22060i sxi \u2206j szj \u2212 \u22060j sxj\nb = \u22121\nEi szi , U\nUij\n.\n2 i,j=1\nEi\nEj\ni=1\n\nAssume that we have resonant transition involving all\nthree TLS between states szi = szj = \u2212szk = 1/2 \u2190\u2192\nszi = szj = \u2212szk = \u22121/2 or equivalently | + +\u2212 >\u2190\u2192\n|\u2212\u2212+ >. In resonance the transition energy Ei +Ej \u2212Ek\nmust be small so in our estimate we set Ei + Ej \u2248 Ek .\nThe transition amplitude between states | + +\u2212 > and\n\n(7)\n\n(9)\n\nb . In the\n| \u2212 \u2212+ > is defined by the TLS interaction U\nb one has Jijk =< + + \u2212|U\nb | \u2212 \u2212+ >= 0.\nfirst order in U\nThe first term is equal zero because there is no three spin\ntransition terms in the TLS Hamiltonian Eq. (9) because\nsuch terms must contain the product of three sx terms,\nwhile the maximum number of sx terms is two. In the\n\n\f3\n\nJijk = \u2212\n\nX < + + \u2212|U\nb |a >< a|U\nb | \u2212 \u2212+ >\na\n\nEa \u2212 Ei \u2212 Ej \u2212 Ek\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all possible intermediate\nb 0 Eq. (9). Taking all possible\nstates of the Hamiltonian H\nintermediate states we found the following final expression\n\u22060i \u22060j \u22060k\n8Ek Ej Ek\n\u0014\n\u0015\nUij Uik \u2206i\nUij Ujk \u2206j\nUik Ujk \u2206k\n\u00d7 \u2212\n.\n\u2212\n+\nEj Ek\nEi Ek\nEi Ej\nJijk \u2248 \u2212\n\n(11)\n\nThis result fully disagrees with the estimate Eq. (7) of\nRef. [1]. When the distance between, say, TLS k and\nTLSs i and j becomes large the amplitude Eq. (11) de3\n3\ncreases as Jijk \u221d 1/Rik\n\u223c 1/Rjk\nin contrast with Eq.\n(7) where this amplitude is independent of the longest\ndistance between TLS.\nWe also verified our result for the triple TLS transition\namplitude using exact numerical solution of the Hamiltonian Eq. (9). The most straightforward definition of the\ntransition amplitude is based on the repulsion of energy\nlevels. If we have two nearly degenerate energy levels\nwith energies E1 and E2 coupled by the perturbation\nmatrix element V then the energy splitting of two levels\ncan be represented as\nr\n(E1 \u2212 E2 )2\n+ V 2.\n(12)\n\u03b4E = 2\n4\nThen the coupling matrix element can be defined as the\nminimum energy splitting for two energy levels. One can\nextract the transition matrix element V from the exact\nsolution for the energy levels of the Hamiltonian Eq. (9).\nWe minimize the splitting of energy levels with respect\nto the asymmetry energy of the third TLS \u2206k . Generally one can find four local energy minima corresponding\nto two pair resonances Ek \u2248 Ei and Ek \u2248 Ej and two\ntriple resonances, which are realized if Ei + Ej \u2248 Ek and\n|Ei \u2212 Ej | \u2248 Ek . We are not interested in pair resonances\nbecause their number has been already estimated and\nproved to be small.[1, 9] We study only one of the two pair\nresonances corresponding to the condition Ei + Ej \u2248 Ek ,\nwhich was assumed in our analytical estimate Eq. (11)\nusing the Scilab package.[12]. We have generated the parameters of three TLSs using the random number generator between 0 and 1 which are \u2206i = 0.544, \u2206j = 0.232,\n\u22060i = 0.231, \u22060j = 0.216 and \u22060k = 0.883, take the\ndisplacement vector between TLSs i and k to be (0, 0, 2)\nand compute the transition amplitude as the function of\nthe length of the vector connecting TLS i and j in the\nform rjk = \u03b7(200). The interaction has been set in the\n3\n3\n3\n; Uik = \u22121/rik\n; Ujk = 0.5/rjk\n. The\nform Uij = 1/rij\ngraph in Fig. 1 shows the comparison of numerical approach with our predictions Eq. (11) and the predictions\n\nof Eq. (7), Ref. [1]. It is clear that the approach of\nRef. [1] deviates from our estimate and exact calculations by several orders of magnitude. The analysis of\nthe second resonance leads to the same results. Thus we\nminimize the energy splitting between two energy levels\nof the Hamiltonian Eq. (9) assuming Ei + Ej \u2248 Ek . If\nwe enumerate all eight energy levels in ascending order\nthese would be fourth and fifth energy levels having the\nenergies E4,5 \u2248 \u00b1(Ei + Ej \u2212 Ek ) \u2248 0. The minimization\nleads to the resonant asymmetry energy \u2206k\u2217 .\nOne can estimate the number of triple resonances W3\nusing the transition amplitude Eq. (11). This number\ncan be obtained summing the number of all TLS triples\ninvolving the given TLS with the constraint that the energy of TLS transition | Ei + Ej \u2212 Ek | is less than the\ntransition amplitude Jijk Eq. (11). This constraint can\nbe approximately taking into account by replacing the\nintegral over the third TLS energy with | Jijk |.
