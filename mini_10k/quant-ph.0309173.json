This\ndependence is counter-intuitive to what would be expected if the one-photon detuning resulted in\nan interaction of the light with the resonant velocity subgroup.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nElectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has\nbeen the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental studies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Materials displaying EIT\nhave many interesting properties, such as narrow resonance width and steep dispersion resulting in ultra-low\nlight group velocity [9, 10, 11]. These properties make\nEIT interesting for several practical applications, such as\nfrequency standards [12], precision magnetometry [13],\nenhanced nonlinear optics [14, 15, 16, 17], and quantum\ninformation storage [18, 19, 20].\nThe group velocity of light in media can be expressed\nas [21]\nvg =\n\nc \u2212 \u03c9 \u2202n(\u03c9,k)\nd\u03c9\n\u2202k\n=\n= \u1e7dg \u2212 vs\ndk\nn(\u03c9, k) + \u03c9 \u2202n(\u03c9,k)\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum, \u03c9 is the frequency\nof the field, n is the index of refraction in the medium, k\nis the vacuum wave number, and we have defined\n\u1e7dg =\n\nc\n\n(2)\n\nn(\u03c9, k) + \u03c9 \u2202n(\u03c9,k)\n\u2202\u03c9\n\nand\nvs =\n\n\u03c9 \u2202n(\u03c9,k)\n\u2202k\nn(\u03c9, k) + \u03c9 \u2202n(\u03c9,k)\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nHere and below we use the convention that terms with\na tilde ( \u0303) denote values in the moving reference frame\nand terms with no tilde denote values in the laboratory\nframe.\nThe first term, \u1e7dg , is due to frequency dispersion and\nthe second term, vs , is due to spatial dispersion. Because of spatial dispersion, the group velocity is different for atoms with different speeds va . This is easily\nseen because in the moving frame \u03c9\u0303 = \u03c9 \u2212 kva (we\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: evmik@tamu.edu, telephone: (979) 847-8593,\naddress: rost@atlantic.tamu.edu\n\u2021 Electronic address: grw@tamu.edu\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ntake va positive for an atom moving in the same direction as the light propagation), from which we see that\nvg = d\u03c9\ndk = \u1e7dg + va . This is just just the Galilean transformation from the moving frame of the atoms to the\nlaboratory frame. Thus, a mono-velocity atomic beam\nmoving in the opposite direction from the light propagation direction slows the group velocity.\nIn a dense Doppler broadened medium, it is possible\nto obtain slower or even zero group velocity [21, 22] for\nthe probe field in a \u039b configuration of strong drive and\nweak probe fields when both are red detuned but maintain the two-photon resonance condition. The following\nconditions on the power of the drive field must be satisfied\n\u221a\n\u03a9 \u226b \u03b3\u03b3cb\n(4)\nr\n\u03b3cb\n(5)\n\u03a9 \u226a kd vT\n\u03b3\nwhere \u03a9 is the Rabi frequency of the drive laser and kd\nis its wave vector, vT is the average thermal velocity, \u03b3\nis the decay rate of the upper level, and \u03b3cb is the decay\nrate of coherence between the lower (ground) levels.\nEquation (4) is just the usual condition for EIT for individual atoms. Equation (5) is applicable only for the\ncase where the drive field is weak enough that EIT occurs only for a narrow spread of atomic velocities. In this\ncase, the intensity of the drive field is not large enough to\npump all atomic velocity subgroups into the dark state.\nThis means that the optical pumping rate |\u03a9|2 \u03b3/\u22062 , for\natoms having one-photon detuning \u2206, is less than the\nrelaxation rate \u03b3bc , between levels b and c. Therefore\n|\u03a9|2 \u03b3/\u22062 < \u03b3bc implies that EIT does not occur for\nall moving atoms and the light interacts with a quasi\natomic beam. When these conditions are satisfied, one\ncan choose a velocity sub-group of atoms with a particular average velocity (in the direction of light\np propagation) and narrow velocity spread \u2206v \u2248 k\u03a9d \u03b3cb /\u03b3. This\nis accomplished by changing the one-photon detuning of\nthe drive laser field while maintaining two-photon resonance. In this case, the center of the quasi-beam of\nmoving atoms is determined by the simple Doppler relation\nfax: (979) 845-2590,\n\u2206\n(6)\nva = c\n\u03c9d\n\n\f2\nwhere \u03c9d is the drive laser frequency. Naturally we would\nexpect atoms moving with the atomic quasi-beam to increase the group velocity, and atoms moving in the opposite direction to \"drag\" light with them, or decrease\nthe total group velocity.\nThe intuitive picture described above is quantified rigorously in Ref. [21]. In the present paper, we experimentally study these theoretical predictions by measuring\nthe dependence of the group velocity on probe-field onephoton detuning for different experimental conditions.\nA common method of increasing the dispersion in an\nEIT medium is to lengthen the ground-state coherence\nlifetime, thereby decreasing the linewidth of the EIT resonance. The coherence lifetime is often limited by the\ninteraction time of the atoms with the lasers. Common methods for increasing this lifetime are by introducing a buffer gas to confine the atoms [1, 3, 23, 24],\nusing wall coatings in the cell so that coherence is preserved between successive interactions of the atoms and\nthe lasers [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], and by cooling and\ntrapping the atoms [31, 32].\nWe have found that for EIT conditions in a sample with\nbuffer gas (with linewidth on the order of several kHz and\ngroup velocity on the order of a few tens to hundreds of\nmeters/sec) the probe field has a slower group velocity\nwhen it is blue detuned with respect to resonance and\nhigher group velocity for red detuning. This result is\nopposite to the intuitive picture described above, and to\nthat of Kocharovskaya et al. in [21].\n\nMS\n\nRb\n\nPD\n\nDrive\nECDL\n\nFG\n\nSA\n\nLA\n\nPA\n100Hz\n\nComputer\nProbe\nECDL\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the experimental setup.

One external cavity diode laser (ECDL) is used\nas the source of a strong driving field and another as a\nweak probe. The drive and probe lasers are combined\nand pass through a cell containing isotopically enhanced\n87\nRb vapor. The 87 Rb density is varied by changing the\ntemperature of the cell. A three layer magnetic shield\n(MS) screens out the laboratory magnetic field.\nThe lasers are phase locked to each other with a frequency offset that is tunable about the ground level\nhyperfine splitting of 87 Rb (6835 MHz). The lasers\nare spatially mode-matched with a single-mode optical\nfiber. The drive laser is tuned to the 5S1/2 (F = 2) \u2192\n5P1/2 (F \u2032 = 2) transition of 87 Rb and the probe laser is\ntuned to the 5S1/2 (F = 1) \u2192 5P1/2 (F \u2032 = 2) transition\nas shown in Figure 2.\nThe configuration of drive and probe lasers shown in\nFigure 2 is called a \u039b configuration. In this case, the\nlasers optically pump all atoms in the desired velocity\nsubgroup into a dark state superposition of the ground\nlevels, giving rise to strong coherence between these lower\nlevels. Scattering of the drive field on this coherence results in the generation of a fairly strong Stokes compo-\n\nFIG. 2: Relevant levels in\n\n87\n\nRb.\n\nnent (new field) in the medium (shown in Figure 2). The\ngeneration of this new field near two-photon resonance of\nthe drive and probe field is described in Ref. [4, 10, 33].\nThe transmitted drive and probe fields and the generated Stokes field are detected separately by heterodyne\ndetection on a fast photo detector. This is done by splitting off part of the drive field from the main beam before entering the cell. This component is shifted up in\nfrequency by a small amount (60 MHz), and combined\nwith the beams exiting the cell before the photo-detector.\nThe photo-current thus contains beat signals at various\nRF frequencies, separated by 60 MHz, in the vicinity of\nthe 6835 MHz separation of the drive and probe. By\nseparately analyzing these components with a spectrum\nanalyzer (SA), we extract the transmitted probe and generated new fields independently. This technique is described in Ref. [10, 33].\n\n\f3\nB.\n\nTime delay and group velocity measurement\nprocedure.\n\n16\n\nWe extract the group velocity in the medium by modulating the intensity of the probe field before the cell, and\nobserving the time delay before this modulation is observed in the transmitted field. Experiments have been\nconducted with gaussian shaped (temporal) pulses and\nwith sinusoidal modulation. We find that the delay time\nis independent of the probe field modulation technique as\nlong as the bandwidth of the modulation does not exceed\nthe transmission linewidth of the EIT resonance.\nThe modulation is generated by use of a frequency generator (FG) which drives an acousto-optical (AO) modulator in the probe laser. The deflected beam from the AO\nis blocked, so the AO serves as a probe power attenuator\n(PA in Figure 1). We also measure the time delay of the\ngenerated new field.\nWith a sinusoidal modulation of the probe, lock-in detection of the transmitted probe field provides a sensitive\nmeasure of the time delay due to the medium. When using lock-in detection in this way, we obtain the time delay\nfrom the phase shift of the transmitted probe field intensity relative to the probe intensity before the cell. For a\nsine wave of frequency f , this phase shift is given by\n\u03c8 = 2\u03c0\u03c4d f \u2212 \u03c80 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c4d is the time delay introduced by the atoms and\n\u03c80 is a phase shift introduced by electronics. To eliminate the unknown \u03c80 we measure the phase shift for\nseveral different modulation frequencies. The phase shift\nincreases linearly with frequency f and the slope of this\nline is 2\u03c0\u03c4d . We extract \u03c4d with a least squares fit. We\nthen find the group velocity vg by setting vg = L/\u03c4d\nwhere L is the length of the cell. (L \u2248 1 cm for our\nexperiment.)\nAnother experimental technique to simplify the group\nvelocity measurement is to replace the second laser\nand phase-lock circuitry with an electro-optic modulator (EOM) in the drive laser beam. By applying a\nnarrow tunable microwave signal to the EOM, upper\nand lower sidebands are generated at the microwave frequency, which we choose to match the 6.835 GHz ground\nstate hyperfine splitting. We tune the laser to the drive\ntransition, so that the upper sideband drives the probe\ntransition and the lower sideband is off resonance. We\nchoose the microwave amplitude to generate a sideband\nwith power that is 1/10 of the drive power. A careful comparison of the two methods (two phased locked\nlasers versus one modulated laser) shows no difference in\nthe group velocity measurements. We note that a similar\ntechnique is to modulate the laser current, which directly\ncreates sidebands on the laser, has also been successfully\nemployed [34].\nWe measure the dependence of vg on one-photon laser\ndetuning \u2206 = \u03c9d \u2212 \u03c922 , where \u03c9d is the frequency of\nthe drive laser and \u03c922 is the frequency of the F = 2 \u2192\nF \u2032 = 2 transition.

These measurements may then be repeated for different 87 Rb densities (different temperatures of the cell).\n\nC.\n\nExperimental results\n\nWe first consider the case where no buffer gas is used,\nand the ground-state coherence lifetime is limited by the\nfree-flight transit time of the thermal rubidium atoms\nthrough the laser beam. In our experiment, the EIT\ntransmission linewidth is 30 kHz and the resulting group\nvelocity on the order of 10 km/s. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the group velocity as a function of the drive\nlaser frequency in the vicinity of the drive resonance. The\ngroup velocity is too large to observe the spatial dispersion effect described in the introduction. Another way to\nsee this is to note that the group velocity is much higher\nthan the mean thermal speed of the atoms. In Figure 3\nthe drive detuning spans the full range of the upper-state\nhyperfine splitting, and the small feature on the left of\nthe spectrum is the result of generating EIT on the upper\nF \u2032 = 1 level (see Figure 2).\nNext we narrow the transmission linewidth with a\nbuffer gas. This increases the dispersion considerably,\nresulting in reduced group velocity. Figure 4 shows the\ngroup velocity as a function of drive laser detuning for\nsimilar conditions as Figure 3 but with the addition of 3\ntorr of N2 buffer gas. The EIT transmission linewidth is\nonly a few kHz and we see that the group velocity has\nfallen to below 100 m/s. We also see that increasing the\nlaser beam diameter increases the dispersion and reduces\n\n\f4\n\nGroup velosity of probe field, [m/s]\n\n300\n\ndiameter < 1mm\ndiameter 2-3mm\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500\nDrive laser detuning, [MHZ]\n\nFIG. 4: Probe field group velocity vs drive laser one-photon\ndetuning in a cell with 3 torr of N2 buffer gas.

Inset: blow-up of the data\nin the vicinity of resonance, showing an increase to the red\nand decrease to the blue of resonance.\n\nthe group velocity as expected.\nFigure 5 shows how the group velocity depends on\ndrive laser detuning for increasing atomic density. We\nobserve a lowering of the group velocity for higher density, but in no case do we observe a lowering of the group\nvelocity as the drive laser is detuned red of resonance,\nwhich we would expect based on the prediction of dragging slow light by atoms moving opposite to the laser\npropagation direction [21]. On the contrary, we see the\ngroup velocity increase for negative drive laser detuning,\nand a minimum group for one-photon detuning about\n100 MHz blue of one-photon resonance (see Figure 5).\nThe explanation of this effect is still not clear, but it is\nplausible that this counter-intuitive behavior is caused by\nvelocity changing collisions in the presence of the buffer\ngas. We note that when the beam diameter decreases, the\n\ngroup velocity dependence versus one-photon detuning\nbecomes more shifted to the side of negative detuning\n(see Figure 4). In other words, the behavior becomes\nless counter-intuitive. We explain this by noting that for\na very narrow beam, fewer velocity changing collisions\ntake place before the atom leaves the laser beam. In any\ncase, it is clear that the discussion of Ref. [21] about a\nquasi mono-velocity beam is not applicable in the case\nwith a buffer gas, since all velocity groups are mixed by\nvelocity changing collisions.\nWhen the density of 87 Rb atoms is increased (\u2248\n1012 cm\u22123 ) highly nonlinear interaction of the drive and\nprobe fields leads to very efficient generation of a Stokes\ncomponent, or new field [4, 10]. We can measure the intensity of the generated field as a function of two-photon\ndetuning and find the width to be greater than the transmission width of the EIT resonance of the probe field.\n(Under the conditions in our experiment it is roughly a\nfactor of two wider [33].) Correspondingly, we also measure the time delay between modulation of the probe field\nbefore the cell and the resulting modulation of the new\nfield after the cell. For the rubidium cell with buffer gas,\nthis delay time is smaller than for the probe field, meaning that the group velocity of the new field (vn ) is greater\nthan the group velocity of the probe field (vp ). This is no\ngreat surprise since the new field is propagating far from\none-photon resonance.\nAs discussed above, as the rubidium density is increased the probe field group velocity decreases. Similar behavior occurs for the generated new field for low\ndensity. However, for large atomic density the group velocity for the new field starts to increase with density.\nThese results are shown in Figure 6. This dependence is\nconnected with a propagation effect. The effective generation of new field occurs in the part of the cell where the\ngroup velocity is small. As the light propagates through\nthe cell, the drive field intensity decreases until the new\nfield is decoupled from the probe. After this point, the\nnew field propagates at nearly the vacuum speed of light.\nThus the observed average speed of new field increases\nwith atomic density.\nWe can also measure the new-field group velocity as a\nfunction of drive laser detuning. The results are shown in\nFigure 7. We find that the the group velocity is smaller\nfor negative one-photon detuning than for positive detuning in vicinity of resonance. This behavior follows\nthe intuitive predictions of Ref. [21].\n\nIII.\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nWe observe counter-intuitive dependence of the probe\nfield group velocity versus drive field one-photon detuning for different densities (temperatures) of 87 Rb (see\nFigure 5). The group velocity decreases slightly for bluedetuned drive fields and increases slightly for red-detuned\nfields. We conclude that the the predictions of Ref. [21]\ncannot be applied to the case where the EIT linewidth\n\n\f5\nis reduced with a buffer gas, since all velocities are constantly mixing via velocity changing collisions. Unfortunately, without a buffer gas we cannot achieve narrow\nenough EIT resonances to reach the amount of dispersion\nneeded to get group velocities low enough to observe the\neffect of dragging the light by atoms.\n\n80\n\nGroup velocity, [m/s]\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n\nWe find that the group velocity is higher for the generated Stokes field, and that the behavior as a function\nof detuning is opposite that of the probe field.\n\n20\n10\n\nprobe field\nnew field\n\n0\n1\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n12\n\n3\n\n3.2\n\n3\n\nDensity, [10 /cm ]\n\nFIG. 6: Group velocity vs density of 87 Rb atoms for probe\nand new fields, for the same cell as in Figure 4.
